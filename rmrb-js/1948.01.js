The number of participants reached 150,000 to 200,000. The chairman of the Transportation Workers' Union presided over the meeting. Japanese Communist Party leader Tokuda also attended and gave a speech. In an atmosphere of激愤 (ji fen - intense anger), the conference passed a resolution denouncing the Katayama Socialist Party government for never implementing the socialist policies it proclaimed upon taking office, and the working class has expressed great disappointment with this kind of deception. The resolution continued: Japan's economic crisis is becoming increasingly serious, leading to a total collapse of the national economy. This fact has proven that the reactionary capitalists' construction plans cannot revive the national economy; the only way to complete national construction is to accept the plans proposed by the workers. The resolution emphasized: The nation's workers are fully aware of their great responsibility for national construction, and stated that the task of national construction must be completed based on the principles of people's democracy, including the socialization of industry. The resolution concluded by stating that workers will strive to implement the slogans passed by the conference, including demanding a minimum wage sufficient to maintain a normal life and rescinding the government's recent statement condemning civil servants' \"willful\" strikes. After the meeting, the masses divided into nine teams to hold demonstrations, one of which was composed of the organizers of the conference, and marched to the Prime Minister's residence, the Diet, the Supreme Court, and other agencies, respectively, to convey the conference resolution to them.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东京二十万工人示威　指斥片山内阁反动政策  要求保证人民生活权利\n\n1948-01-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东京二十万工人示威\n  　指斥片山内阁反动政策\n    要求保证人民生活权利\n    【新华社陕北二十六日电】东京讯：全日交通工人工会，于二十一日在保证人民生活权利之口号下，在东京发动大规模之群众大会，会后并举行盛大示威游行。与会群众达十五万至二十万人。该会由交通工会主席任大会主席。日共领袖德田亦曾出席演讲。大会在群情激愤中通过决议，指斥片山之社会党政府，从未实行其上台时所宣称之社会主义政策，工人阶级已对此种欺骗甚表失望。决议继称：日本经济危机正日趋严重，而导向国民经济之总崩溃。此项事实已证明反动资本家之建设计划绝不能复兴国民经济，唯一能完成国家建设之途径即在接受工人所提之计划。决议强调声称：全国工人已充分认识对国家建设之伟大责任，并称，必须根据包括工业社会化之人民民主原则，以完成国家建设之重任。决议最后力称，工人将为实行大会通过之口号而努力，其中包括要求能维持正常生活之最低限度工资，及取消政府最近谴责工务员“意志”罢工之声明。会后，群众分成九队举行示威游行，由大会发起人组成之一队，并游行至首相官邸、国会、最高法院等各机关，分别向之传达大会决议。"

（一九四七年十二月二十五日在中共中央会议上的报告）\n毛泽东\n1948-01-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　目前形势和我们的任务\n    （一九四七年十二月二十五日在中共中央会议上的报告）\n    毛泽东\n    （一）中国人民的革命战争，现在已经达到了一个转折点；这即是中国人民解放军已经打退了美国走狗蒋介石的数百万反动军队的进攻，并使自己转入了进攻。还在一九四六年七月至一九四七年六月战争第一个年头内，人民解放军即已在几个战场上打退了蒋介石的进攻，迫使蒋介石转入防御地位。而从战争第二年的第一季，即一九四七年七月至九月间，人民解放军即已转入了全国规模的进攻，破坏了蒋介石将战争继续引向解放区、企图彻底破坏解放区的反革命计划。现在，战争主要地已经不是在解放区里进行，而是在国民党统治区里进行了，人民解放军的主力已经打到国民党统治区域里去了。中国人民解放军已经在中国这一块土地上扭转了美国帝国主义及蒋介石匪帮的反革命车轮，使之走向覆灭的道路；推进了自己的革命车轮，使之走向胜利的道路。这是一个历史的转折点。这是蒋介石二十年反革命统治由发展到消灭的转折点。这是一百多年以来帝国主义在中国的统治由发展到消灭的转折点。这是一个伟大的事变。这个事变所以带着伟大性，是因为这个事变发生在一个具有四万万五千万人口的国家内；这个事变一经发生，它就将必然地走向全国的胜利。这个事变所以带着伟大性，还因为这个事变发生在世界的东方，在这里，共有十万万以上人口（占人类的一半）遭受帝国主义的压迫；中国人民的解放战争由防御转到进攻，不能不引起这些被压迫民族的欢欣鼓舞。同时，对于正在斗争的欧洲与美洲各国的被压迫人民也是一种援助。\n    （二）从蒋介石发动反革命战争的一天起，我们就说，我们不但必须打败蒋介石，而且能够打败他。我们必须打败蒋介石，是因为蒋介石发动的战争，是一个在美帝国主义指挥之下的反对中国民族独立与中国人民解放的反革命的战争。中国人民的任务，是要在第二次世界大战结束、日本帝国主义被打倒以后，在政治上并经济上、文化上完成新民主主义的改革，实现民族的统一与独立，由农业国变成工业国。然而恰在这时，在第二次世界大战胜利地结束以后，美国帝国主义及其在各国的走狗代替德国与日本帝国主义及其走狗的地位，组成反动阵营，反对苏联，反对欧洲各新民主国家，反对各资本主义国家的工人运动，反对各殖民地半殖民地的民族运动，反对中国人民的解放。在这种时候，以蒋介石为首的中国反动派，和日本帝国主义的走狗汪精卫一模一样，充当美国帝国主义的走狗，将中国出卖给美国，发动战争，反对中国人民，阻止中国人民解放事业的前进。在这种时候，如果我们表示软弱，表示退让，不敢坚决地起来用革命战争反对反革命战争，中国就将变成黑暗世界，我们民族的前途就将被断送。中国共产党领导中国人民解放军坚决的进行了爱国的正义的革命的战争，反对蒋介石的进攻。中国共产党依据马克思列宁主义的科学，清醒地估计了国际与国内的形势，知道一切内外反动派的进攻不但是必须打败的，而且是能够打败的。当着天空中似乎是黑暗的时候，我们就指出：这不过是暂时的现象，暴风雨即将过去，曙光即在前头。当年一九四六年七月，蒋介石匪帮发动全国规模的反革命战争的时候，蒋介石匪帮认为，只须三个月至六个月，就可以打败人民解放军。他们认为他们有正规军二百万，非正规军一百余万，后方军事机关及部队一百余万，共有军事力量四百余万人；他们已经利用时间完成了进攻的准备；他们重新控制了大城市；他们拥有三万万以上的人口；他们接收了日本侵华军队一百万人的全部装备；他们取得了美国政府在军事上与财政上的巨大援助。他们又认为，中国人民解放军在八年抗日战争中已经打得很疲倦，而且在数量上与装备上远不及国民党军队；中国解放区还只有一万万多一点的人口，其中大部分地区的反动封建势力还没有被肃清，土地改革还不普遍与不彻底，人民解放军的后方还不是巩固的。在这些基础上，蒋介石匪帮就不顾中国人民的和平愿望，最后地撕毁在一九四六年一月间签订的国共两党的停战协定及各党派政治协商会议的决议，发动了冒险的战争。那时我们说，我们敌人军事力量的优势，这只是暂时的现象，这只是临时起作用的因素；美国帝国主义的援助，也只是临时起作用的因素；而蒋介石战争的反人民的性质，人心的向背，则是经常起作用的因素；而在这方面，人民解放军则占着优势。人民解放军的战争所具有的爱国的正义的革命的性质，必然要获得全国人民的拥护。这就是战胜蒋介石的政治基础。十八个月战争的经验，充分地证明了我们的论断。\n    （三）十七个月（一九四六年七月至一九四七年十一月为止，十二月尚未计入）作战，共歼灭了蒋介石正规军及非正规军一百六十九万人，其中被打死打伤的六十四万人，被俘掳的一百零五万人。这样，就使我军打退了蒋介石的进攻，保存了解放区的基本区域，并使自己转入了进攻。我们所以能够如此，在军事方面来说，是因为执行了正确的战略方针。我们的军事原则是：（１）先打分散孤立之敌，后打集中强大之敌。（２）先取小城市、中等城市及广大乡村，后取大城市。（３）以歼灭敌人有生力量为主要目标，不以保守或夺取城市及地方为主要目标。保守或夺取城市及地方，是歼灭敌人有生力量的结果，往往须要反复多次才能最后地保守或夺取之。（４）每战集中绝对优势兵力（两倍、三倍、四倍、有时甚至是五倍或六倍于敌之兵力），四面包围敌人，力求全歼，不使漏网。在特殊情况下，则采用给敌以歼灭性打击之方法，即集中全力打敌正面及其一翼、或两翼，求达歼灭其一部、击溃其另一部之目的，以便我军能够迅速转移兵力歼击他部敌军。力求避免打那种得不偿失的、或得失相当的消耗战。这样，在全体上，我们是劣势（就数量来说），但在每一个局部上，每一个具体战役上，我们是绝对的优势，保证了战役的胜利。随着时间的推移，我们就将在全体上转变为优势，直到歼灭一切敌人。（５）不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗，每战都应力求有准备，力求在敌我条件对比下有胜利之把握。（６）发扬勇敢战斗，不怕牺牲，不怕疲劳与连续作战（即短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。（７）力求在运动中歼灭敌人。同时，注重阵地攻击战术，夺取敌人的据点及城市。（８）在攻城问题上，一切敌人守备薄弱的据点及城市则坚决夺取之。一切敌人有中等程度之守备而又为环境所许可之据点及城市，则相机夺取之。一切敌人守备强固之据点及城市，则等候条件成熟时然后夺取之。（９）以俘获敌人的全部武器及大部人员，补充自己。我军人力物力的来源，主要在前线。（１０）善于利用两个战役之间的间隙休息与整训部队。休整的时间一般地不要过长，尽可能不使敌人获得喘息时间。以上这些，就是人民解放军打败蒋介石的主要的方法。这些方法，是人民解放军在和内外敌人长期作战中锻炼出来，并完全适合我们目前的情况的。蒋介石匪帮及美国帝国主义的在华军事人员，熟知我们的这些军事方法。蒋介石曾经多次召集他的将校受训，将我们的军事书籍及从战争中获得的文件发给他们研究，企图寻找对付的方法。美国军事人员则向蒋介石建议这样那样的消灭人民解放军的战略战术；并替蒋介石直接训练军队，接济军事装备。但是所有这些努力，都不能挽救蒋介石匪帮的失败。这是因为我们的战略战术是建立在人民战争这个基础上的，任何反人民的军队都不能利用我们的战略战术。在人民战争的基础上，在军队与人民团结一致、指挥员与战斗员团结一致、及瓦解敌军等项目标的基础上，建立起人民解放军的强有力的革命的政治工作，这是战胜敌人的重大因素。当着我们避开优势敌人的致命打击，并转移军力求得在运动中歼灭敌人，而主动地放弃许多城市的时候，我们的敌人是兴高采烈了。他们认为这就是他们的胜利和我们的失败。他们被一时的所谓胜利冲昏了头脑。张家口被占领的第二天，蒋介石即下令召集他的反动的国民大会，似乎他的反动统治从此可以安如泰山了。美国帝国主义分子也手舞足蹈，似乎他们将中国变为美国殖民地的狂妄计划，从此可以毫无阻碍地实现了。但是，随着时间推移，蒋介石及其美国主子的腔调也发生了变化。现在是一切内外敌人都被他们的悲观情绪所统治的时候。他们唉声叹气，大叫危机，一点欢乐的影子也看不见了。十八个月中，蒋介石的前线高级指挥官，大部分因为战败被撤换。这里有郑州的刘峙，徐州的薛岳，苏北的吴奇伟，鲁南的汤恩伯，豫北的王仲廉，沈阳的杜聿明、熊式辉，北平的孙连仲等人。负指挥全部作战责任的蒋介石的参谋总长陈诚，亦被取消此种指挥职权，降为东北一个战场的指挥官。而在蒋介石自己代替陈诚担任全局指挥的期间，却发生了蒋军由进攻转入防御、人民解放军由防御转入进攻这样一个局面。蒋介石反动集团及其美国主子，现在应当感觉到他们自己的错误了。他们将日本投降以后一个长时间内，中国共产党代表中国人民的愿望，力争和平反对内战的一切努力，看作是胆怯与力量薄弱的表现。他们过高估计了自己力量，过低估计了革命力量，冒险地发动战争，因而落在他们自己布置的陷阱里。我们敌人的战略打算是彻底地输了。\n    （四）现在，比较十八个月以前，人民解放军的后方也巩固得多了。这是由于我党坚决地站在农民方面实行土地改革的结果。在抗日战争时期，为着和国民党建立抗日统一战线及团结当时尚能反对日本的人们起见，我党主动地由抗日以前的没收地主土地分配给农民的政策，改变为减租减息的政策，这是完全必需的。日本投降以后，农民迫切要求土地，我们就及时地作出决定，改变土地政策，由减租减息改为没收地主阶级的土地分配给农民。我党中央一九四六年五月四日发出的指示，就是表现这种改变。一九四七年九月，我党召集了全国土地会议，制定了中国土地法大纲，并立即在各地普遍实行。这个步骤，不但肯定了去年五四指示的方针，而且对于去年五四指示中的某些不彻底性（地主得到较农民为多的土地财产，富农的土地财产原则上不动）作了明确的改正。中国土地法大纲规定，在消灭封建性及半封建性剥削的土地制度、实行耕者有其田的土地制度的原则下，按人口平均分配土地。这是消灭封建制度的最彻底的方法，这是完全适合于中国广大农民群众的要求的。为着坚决地彻底地进行土地改革，乡村中不但必须组织包括雇农贫农中农在内的最广泛群众性的农会及其选出的委员会，而且必须首先组织包括贫农雇农群众的贫农团及其选出的委员会，以为执行土地改革的合法机关，而贫农团则应当成为一切国民斗争的领导骨干。我们的方针是依靠贫农，巩固地联合中农，消灭地主阶级及旧式富农的封建的及半封建的剥削制度。地主富农应得的土地及财产，不能超过农民群众。但是，曾经在一九三一至一九三四年期间实行过的所谓“地主不分田、富农分坏田”的过左的错误的政策，也不应重复。地主富农在乡村人口中所占的比例，虽然各地有多有少，但按一般情况来说，大约只占百分之八十一（以户为单位计算），而他们占有的土地，按照一般情况，则达全部土地的百分之七十至八十。因此，我们土地改革所反对的对象，人数甚少；而乡村中能够参加与应当参加土地改革统一战线的人数（户数），则有大约百分之九十以上这样多。这里必须注意两条基本原则：第一，必须满足贫农与雇农的要求，这是土地改革的最基本的任务。第二，必须坚决团结中农，不要损害中农的利益。只要我们掌握了这两条基本原则，我们的土地改革任务就一定能够胜利地完成。旧式富农按照平分原则所多余的土地及其一部分财产之所以应当拿出来分配，是因为中国的富农一般地带着很重的封建与半封建剥削的性质，富农大部兼收地租及放高利贷，其雇佣劳动的条件亦是半封建的。还因为他们所占的土地数量很大、质量很好，如不平分则不能满足贫雇农的要求。但是按照土地法大纲的规定，对待富农与对待地主一般地应当有所区别。土地改革中，中农表现赞成平分，这是因为平分并不损害中农。在平分时，中农一部分土地不变动，一部分增加了土地；只有一部分富裕中农有少数多余的土地，他们也愿意拿出来平分，这是因为在平分后土地税的负担他们也减轻了。虽然如此，各地在平分土地时，仍须注意中农的意见，如果中农不同意，则应向中农让步。在没收分配封建阶级的土地财产时应当注意某些中农的需要。在划分阶级成份时，必须注意不要把本来是中农成份的人，错误地将他们划到富农圈子里去。在农会委员会中，在政府中，必须吸收中农积极分子参加工作。在土地税及支援战争的负担上，采取公平合理的原则。这些，就是我党在执行巩固地联合中农这一战略任务时所必须采取的具体政策。全党必须明白，土地制度的彻底改革，是现阶段中国革命的基本任务。如果我们能够普遍地彻底地解决土地问题，我们就获得了足以战胜一切敌人的最基本条件。\n    （五）为了坚决地彻底地实行土地改革，巩固人民解放军的后方，必须整编党的队伍。抗日战争时期我党内部的整风运动，是一般地收到了成效的。这种成效，主要地是在于使我们的领导机关及许多干部进一步地掌握了马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践之统一这样一个基本的方向。在这点上，我们党是比抗日以前的几个历史时期大进一步了。但是，在党的地方组织方面，特别是在党的农村基层组织方面所存在的成份不纯与作风不纯的问题，则没有获得解决。一九三七年至一九四七年，十一年时间内，我们党的组织，由几万党员，发展到了二百七十万党员，这是一个极大的跃进。这使我们的党成了一个空前强大的党。这使我们有可能打败日本帝国主义，并打退了蒋介石的进攻，领导了一万万以上人口的解放区与二百万人民解放军。但是缺点也就跟着来了。这即是有许多地主分子、富农分子及流氓分子乘机混进了我们的党。他们在农村中把持许多党的政府的与民众团体的组织，作威作福，欺压人民，歪曲党的政策，使这些组织脱离群众，使土地改革不能彻底。这种严重情况，就在我们面前提出了整编党的队伍的任务。这个任务如果不解决，我们在农村中就不能前进。党的全国土地会议彻底地讨论了这个问题，并规定了适当的步骤与方法。这些步骤与方法，现在正和平分土地一道在各地坚决实施。其中首先重要的，是在党内展开批评与自我批评，彻底揭发各地组织内的离开党的路线的错误思想与严重现象。全党同志必须明白，解决这个党内不纯的问题，整编党的队伍，使党能够和最广大的劳动群众完全站在一个方向，并领导他们前进，是解决土地问题与支援长期战争的一个决定性的环节。\n    （六）没收封建阶级的土地归农民所有；没收蒋介石、宋子文、孔祥熙、陈立夫为首的垄断资本归新民主主义的国家所有；保护民族工商业；这就是新民主主义革命的三大经济纲领。蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族，在他们当权的二十年中，已经集中了价值达一百万万至二百万万美元的巨大资本，垄断全国的经济命脉。这个垄断资本，与国家政权结合在一起，成为国家垄断资本主义。这个垄断资本主义，与外国帝国主义，与本国地主阶级及旧式富农，密切地结合着，成为买办的封建的国家垄断资本主义。这就是蒋介石反动政权的经济基础。这个国家垄断资本主义，不但压迫工人农民，而且压迫小资产阶级，损害中等资产阶级。这个国家垄断资本主义，在抗日战争期间及日本投降以后，达到了最高峰，它替新民主主义革命准备了充分的物质条件。这个资本，在中国的通俗名称，叫做官僚资本。这个资产阶级，叫做官僚资产阶级，即是中国的大资产阶级。新民主主义的革命对象，除了取消帝国主义在中国的特权以外，在国内，就是要消灭地主阶级与官僚资产阶级（大资产阶级）的剥削与压迫，改变买办的封建的生产关系，解放一切被束缚的生产力。被这些阶级及其国家政权所压迫与损害的小资产阶级及中等资产阶级，虽然也是资产阶级，却是可以参加新民主主义革命，或者保守中立的。他们和帝国主义没有联系，或者联系较少，他们是真正的民族资产阶级。在新民主主义的国家权力到达的地方，对于这些阶级，必须坚决地毫不犹豫地给以保护。蒋介石统治区域的上层小资产阶级及中等资产阶级，其中有为数不多的一部分人，即这些阶级的右翼分子，存在着反动的政治倾向，他们替美国帝国主义与蒋介石反动集团散布幻想，他们反对人民民主革命。当着他们的反动倾向尚能影响群众时，我们应当向着接受他影响的群众进行揭露工作，打击他们在群众中的政治影响，使群众从他们的影响之下解放出来。但是，政治上的打击与经济上的消灭是两件事，如果混合这两件事，我们就要犯错误。新民主主义革命所要消灭的对象，只是封建主义与垄断资本主义，只是地主阶级与官僚资产阶级（大资产阶级），而不是一般地消灭资本主义，不是消灭小资产阶级与中等资产阶级。由于中国经济的落后性，广大的小资产阶级与中等资产阶级所代表的资本主义经济，即使革命在全国胜利以后，在一个长时期内还是必须允许他们存在；并且按照国民经济的分工，还需要他们中一切有益于国民经济的部分有一个发展；他们在整个国民经济中，还是不可缺少的一部分。这里所说的小资产阶级，是指雇佣工人或店员的小规模的工商业资本家。此外还有不雇佣工人或店员的广大的独立的小工商业者。对于这些小工商业者，不待说是应当坚决保护的。革命在全国胜利以后，由于新民主主义国家手里有着从官僚资产阶级接收过来的控制全国经济命脉的巨大的国家资本，又有从封建制度解放出来、虽则在一个颇长时间内在基本上仍然是分散的个体的，但是在将来可以逐步地引向合作社方向发展的农业经济，在这些条件下，这种小的及中等的资本主义成份，其存在及发展，并没有什么危险。对于土地革命后农村中必然发生的新的富农经济，也是如此。对于小资产阶级及中等资产阶级经济成份采取过度的错误的政策，如象我们党在一九三一至一九三四年期间所犯过的那样：过高的劳动条件、过高的所得税率、在土地改革中侵犯工商业者、不以发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利为目标，而以近视的片面的所谓劳动者福利为目标；是绝对不许重复的。这种错误如果重犯，必然要损害劳动群众的利益及新民主主义国家的利益。中国土地法大纲上有一条规定：“保护工商业者的财产及其合法的营业，不受侵犯。”这里所说的工商业者，就是指的一切独立的小工商业者及一切小的与中等的资本主义成份。总起来说，新中国的经济构成是：（１）国家经济，这是领导的成份；（２）由个体逐步地向着集体方向发展的农业经济；（３）独立小工商业者的经济及小的与中等的私人资本经济；这些，就是新民主主义的全部国民经济。而新民主主义国民经济的指导方针，必须紧紧的追随着发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利这个总目标。一切离开这个总目标的方针、政策、办法，都是错误的。\n    （七）一九四七年十月，人民解放军发表宣言，其中说：“联合工农兵学商各被压迫阶级，各人民团体，各民主党派，各少数民族，各地华侨及其他爱国分子，组成民族统一战线，打倒蒋介石独裁政府，成立民主联合政府。”这就是人民解放军的、也是中国共产党的最基本的政治纲领。从表面上看来，现在时期，比较抗日时期，我们的革命的民族统一战线，似乎是缩小了。但在实际上，只是在现在时期，只是在蒋介石出卖民族利益给美国帝国主义，发动反人民的全国规模的国内战争之后，只是在美国帝国主义及蒋介石反动统治集团的罪恶已经在中国人民面前暴露无遗之后，我们的民族统一战线才是真正的扩大了。在抗日时期，蒋介石及国民党在中国人民中还没有完全丧失威信，他们还有许多欺骗作用。现在不同了，他们的一切欺骗都已被他们自己的行为所揭穿，他们已经没有什么群众，他们已经完全孤立了。和国民党相反，中国共产党不但在解放区得到最广大人民群众的信任；在国民党统治区，在国民党控制的大城市，也得到了广大人民群众的拥护。如果说，在一九四六年，在蒋介石统治下的上层小资产阶级及中等资产阶级的知识分子中，还有一部分人怀着所谓“第三条道路”的想法，那么，在现在，这种想法已经破产了。由于我党采取了彻底的土地政策，使我党获得了比较抗日时期广大得多的农民群众的忠心拥护。由于美国帝国主义的侵略，蒋介石的压迫及我党坚决保护群众利益的正确方针，我党获得了蒋介石统治区域工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级及中等资产阶级广大群众的同情。这些群众，因为挨饿，因为政治上受压迫，因为蒋介石的反人民的内战夺去了人民的一切活路，他们就不断的掀起了反对美国帝国主义与蒋介石反动政府的斗争，他们的基本口号是反饥饿，反压迫，反内战及反对美国干涉中国内政。而在抗日以前，在抗日时期，乃至日本投降后一个时期，都没有达到这样的程度。因此我们说，我们的新民主主义的革命的统一战线，现在比过去任何时期都要广大，也比过去任何时期都要巩固。这件事，不但与我们的土地政策及城市政策相联系，而且与人民解放军的胜利，与蒋介石由进攻转入防御，人民解放军由防御转入进攻，中国革命已经进入新的高潮时期这一总的政治形势，密切地联系着。现在人民看到了蒋介石统治的灭亡已经不可避免，因而将希望寄托在中国共产党与人民解放军身上，这是很自然的道理。中国新民主主义的革命要胜利，没有一个包括全民族绝大多数人口的最广泛的统一战线，是不可能的。不但如此，这个统一战线还必须是在中国共产党的坚强的领导之下。没有中国共产党的坚强的领导，任何革命统一战线也是不能胜利的。在一九二七年北伐战争达到高潮的时候，我党领导机关的投降主义分子，自愿放弃对于农民群众、小资产阶级及中等资产阶级的领导权，尤其是放弃对于武装力量的领导权，使那次革命遭到了失败。抗日战争时期，我党反对了和这种投降主义思想相类似的思想，即是对于国民党的反人民政策让步，信任国民党超过信任群众，不敢放手发动群众斗争，不敢在日本占领地区扩大解放区与扩大人民的军队，将抗日战争的领导权送给国民党。我党对于这样一种软弱无能的腐朽的违背马克思列宁主义原则的思想，进行了坚决的斗争，坚决的执行了“发展进步势力、争取中间势力、孤立顽固势力”的政治路线，坚决地扩大了解放区与人民解放军。这样，就不但保证了我党在日本帝国主义侵略时期能够战胜日本帝国主义，而且保证了我党在日本投降以后蒋介石举行反革命战争的时候，能够顺利地不受损失地转变到用人民革命战争反对蒋介石反革命战争的轨道上，并在短时期内取得了伟大的胜利。这些历史教训，全党同志都要牢记。\n    （八）蒋介石反动集团在一九四六年发动全国规模的反人民的国内战争的时候，他们之所以敢于冒险，不但依靠他们自己的优势的军事力量，而且主要地依靠他们认为是异常强大的、举世无敌的、手里拿着原子弹的美国帝国主义，一方面，能够象流水一样地供给他们以军事上与财政上的需要；另一方面，狂妄地设想所谓“美苏必战”、所谓“第三次世界大战必然爆发”。这种对于美国帝国主义的依赖，是第二次世界大战结束以后全世界各国反动势力的共同特点。这件事，反映了第二次世界大战给予世界资本主义的打击的严重性，各国反动派力量的薄弱及其心里的恐慌与丧失信心，反映了全世界革命力量的强大，使得各国反动派除了依靠美国帝国主义的援助就感到毫无出路。但是，在实际上，在第二次世界大战以后的美国帝国主义，是否真如蒋介石及各国反动派所设想的那么强大呢？是否真能象流水一样地从美国接济蒋介石及各国反动派呢？并不如此。美国帝国主义在第二次世界大战期间所增强起来的经济力量，遇着了不稳定的日趋缩小的国内市场与国际市场。这种市场的进一步缩小，就要引起经济危机的爆发。美国的战争景气，仅仅是一时的现象。它的强大，只是表面的与暂时的。危机就象一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。这种情况，迫使美国帝国主义分子建立了奴役世界的计划，象野兽一样，向欧、亚两洲及其他地方乱窜，集合各国的反动势力，那些被人民唾弃的渣滓，组成帝国主义及反民主的阵营，反对以苏联为首的一切民主势力，准备战争，企图在将来，在遥远的时间内，有一天发动第三次世界大战，打败民主力量。这是一个狂妄的计划。全世界民主势力必须打败这个计划，也完全能够打败它。全世界反帝国主义阵营的力量超过帝国主义阵营的力量，优势是在我们方面，不是在敌人方面。以苏联为首的反帝国主义阵营，业已形成。没有危机的向上发展的受到全世界广大人民群众爱护的社会主义的苏联，它的力量，现在就已经超过了被危机严重威胁着的、向下衰落的、受到全世界广大人民群众反对的帝国主义的美国。欧洲各新民主国家，正在巩固其内部，并互相团结起来。以法意为首的欧洲各资本主义国家人民的反帝国主义力量，正在发展。美国内部，存在着日趋强大的人民民主势力。拉丁美洲的人民，并不是顺从美国帝国主义的奴隶。整个亚洲，兴起了伟大的民族解放运动。反帝国主义阵营的一切力量，正在团结起来，并正在向前发展。欧洲九个国家的共产党，业已组成了情报局，发表了号召全世界人民起来反对帝国主义奴役计划的檄文。这篇檄文，振奋了全世界被压迫人民的精神，指示了他们的斗争方向，巩固了他们的胜利信心。全世界反动派，在这篇檄文面前惊慌失措。东方各国一切反帝国主义的力量，也应当团结起来，反对帝国主义及各国内部反动派的压迫，以东方十万万以上被压迫人民获得解放为奋斗的目标。我们自己的命运完全应当由我们自己来掌握。我们应当在自己内部肃清一切软弱无能的思想。一切过高估计敌人力量与过低估计人民力量的观点，都是错误的。我们和全世界民主力量一道，只要大家努力，一定能够打败帝国主义的奴役计划，阻止第三次世界大战，使之不能发生，推翻一切反动派的压迫，夺取人类永久和平的胜利。我们清醒地知道，在我们的前进道路上，还会有种种障碍、种种困难，我们应当准备对付一切内外敌人的最大限度的抵抗与挣扎。但是，只要我们能够掌握马克思列宁主义的科学，信任群众，紧紧地和群众一道，并领导他们前进，我们是完全能够超越任何障碍与战胜任何困难的，我们的力量是无敌的。现在是全世界资本主义与帝国主义走向灭亡，全世界社会主义与民主主义走向胜利的历史时代，曙光就在前面，我们应当努力。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 1st - The Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters has issued its 17th War Communiqué stating: The Northeast battlefield our army braving the extraordinary cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius, launched a powerful winter offensive from December 15th. In the past two weeks (December 15th to 28th), we captured seven cities including Changtu, Kaiyuan, Beizhen, Yutian, Haicheng, Liaozhong, and Zhangwu. We completely annihilated the Chiang bandit 49th Army's 79th Division, one regiment of the 207th Division, one regiment of the Provisional 59th Division, and the Third Column of the Transportation Police. We also completely routed the bandit New 6th Army's New 22nd Division and the 10th Cavalry Division, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 23,000 bandits in total. The main combat details and results are announced as follows: (1) North of Shenyang: Our army recaptured Changtu and Kaiyuan on the 15th and annihilated the bandit Provisional 62nd Division's (Note: A newly formed division belonging to the New 6th Army) 3rd Regiment mortar company at Diaobingshan, 30 miles southeast of Faku, on the same day. A part of our army then besieged Faku. The enemy New 6th Army's entire New 22nd Division and one regiment of the 14th Division rushed to Faku from Tieling to reinforce, but were completely routed by our forces in the Diaobingshan and Shahousuo area (both southeast of Faku) on the 17th, with nearly a thousand annihilated and captured. The remaining enemies abandoned a large number of corpses, wounded soldiers, and ammunition and fled in panic. On the same day, another part of our army completely annihilated the bandit Provisional 59th Division's 2nd Regiment at Dagujiazi, 50 miles south of Faku, killing and capturing over 1,500, including the regimental commander (Note: This bandit now belongs to the New 3rd Army and is formed from local troops). The division's transportation battalion and engineer battalion were also completely wiped out near Shifosi, north of Shenyang, with more than 800 annihilated and captured. On the 23rd, the entire bandit 53rd Army fled from Xin Kaiyuan to Tieling. A part of our army pursued and attacked its rear, capturing more than 600. On the 26th, a part of our cavalry completely routed the enemy 10th Cavalry Division northeast of Xinmin in the Liao River, wounding and capturing more than 300. (2) West and Southwest of Shenyang: Our army destroyed more than 60 miles of the Beining Railway in the Jin (Zhou) Yi (County) section, the Jinzhou to Dalinghe section, and the Yixian to Beipiao section of the Jin-Cheng Railway in the first two days of the offensive. We then marched north and briefly occupied Beizhen County on the 15th, annihilating more than 100 enemy security troops. Another part of our army annihilated two companies of the bandit 49th Army's 26th Division near Xinlitun on the 17th. On the evening of the 21st, we again destroyed a section of the railway from Jinzhou to Jinxi. On the 24th, our army annihilated a battalion of the bandit Provisional 55th Division at Baiqibao, southwest of Xinmin, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 400, including their deputy regimental commander. Another part of our army approached Zhangwu. On the 27th, we cleared the enemy's outer strongholds. On the morning of the 28th, we launched a general offensive at 9:00 a.m. and completely ended the battle at 2:00 p.m., occupying the city. The entire defending 49th Army's 79th Division was annihilated without a single enemy escaping (Note: Two regiments of this division were annihilated in our autumn offensive and this is the newly replenished division), killing, wounding, and capturing over 10,000 enemies. On the same day, we also completely annihilated the bandit 207th Division's 2nd Brigade, 6th Regiment at Wanjintai, more than 60 miles northwest of Shenyang, annihilating and capturing more than 2,000 enemies. (3) South of Shenyang: From the 15th to the 19th, our army successively captured Zhangtaizi Station, Huazigou (i.e., Yantai Coal Mine), Heiyingtai, and Da'anping strongholds on the periphery of Liaoyang, and destroyed more than 60 miles of the Changchun Railway in the Liaoyang to Shenyang section, successively annihilating one battalion of the bandit 52nd Army's Transportation Regiment, the 3rd Battalion of the 75th Regiment of the 25th Division, and the Liaoyang local bandit Yu Zifang's troops, totaling more than 1,700. Another part of our army captured Dashiqiao in one fell swoop on the 19th, completely annihilating the defending Transportation Police 3rd Regiment, killing and wounding more than 1,200 bandits, including the battalion commander. The Haicheng defending enemy 52nd Army's 2nd Division, one regiment, abandoned the city and fled north on the 21st upon hearing the news. The city was then recovered by us. The Chiang bandit security team entrenched in Liaozhong, more than 160 miles southwest of Shenyang, also abandoned the city and fled towards Dahushan, intimidated by our prestige. In addition, our army in eastern Hebei continued to destroy the Beining Railway from Tangshan to Changli, and after recovering Leting on the 12th, we recovered Yutian County on the 18th, and then destroyed the railway from Changli to Beidaihe, providing strong coordination for our army outside the Guan. (4) Preliminary statistics of the two-week results are as follows: A. A total of 23,051 enemy regular army and local army officers and soldiers were killed, wounded, and captured, including 6,884 killed and wounded (4,736 regular army, 2,148 local army), and 16,167 captured alive (12,211 regular army, 3,956 local army). More than ten captured bandit officers above the rank of colonel have been identified, including: Li Mengyou, former bandit Military Commission Major General Staff Officer, He Jinghua, Regimental Commander of the Provisional 59th Division's 2nd Regiment, and Liu Xiujun, Deputy Regimental Commander.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-05",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 3rd:\n\nThe spokesperson of the Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters recently issued a statement summarizing the war achievements of the Northeast Liberated Area throughout 1947, stating: Over the past year, our army has fought heroically, launched four powerful offensives, annihilated more than 280,000 enemies, and recovered 65 cities. This enabled our Northeast Army to switch to the counter-offensive at an early stage, completely taking the initiative in the war, forcing the enemy into a comprehensive defense, and causing a fundamental change in the Northeast war situation. Reviewing the changes in the war situation over the past year: After the Jiang bandits occupied Andong, Tonghua, and vast areas of southern Manchuria in the autumn of the previous year (1946), their offensive reached its peak. However, the enemy still attempted to adopt a strategy of attacking the south and defending the north, and after \"suppressing\" southern Manchuria, they turned their troops north across the Songhua River. In the first three months of last year, the enemy successively concentrated all the forces they could mobilize and launched four consecutive offensives against the narrow area of Linjiang in southern Manchuria. Our army, with the aim of ensuring the base areas of both northern and southern Manchuria and thwarting the enemy's operational policy of \"first south, then north,\" our southern Manchuria troops annihilated the enemy's 25th Division, and inflicted annihilating blows on the enemy in each offensive. Our northern Manchuria troops took the initiative to attack and carried out the famous \"Four Down the Jiangnan\" operations. This caused the enemy to be attacked from both north and south and annihilated piecemeal, completely crushing the enemy's strategic policy of \"first south, then north.\" In total, the three months of the spring offensive resulted in the annihilation of 43,000 enemies and the recovery of 11 cities, basically halting the strategic offensive of the enemy in the Northeast and forcing them to switch to a comprehensive defense. In early May, our army, with the aim of opening up the connection between the two major strategic areas of northern and southern Manchuria, annihilating enemy manpower, recovering lost territory, and opening up the situation, simultaneously launched a summer offensive against the dispersed enemy from the eastern, western, and southern Manchuria battlefields. In the areas of Huaide, Qingyuan, and Meihe, the main force of the enemy's 71st Army, New 1st Army, and 60th Army were largely or partially annihilated. Two major gaps were opened up in the enemy's entire defense system from the east and west, and the Chang(chun)-Shen(yang) section and the Ji(lin)-Shen(yang) section of the Chinese Chang Railway were cut into several sections. The enemies scattered in Hailong, Dongfeng, Laoyeling, Xi'an, Xifeng, Tonghua, Andong, and Chifeng were also completely or largely annihilated by us. As a result, we recovered the vast areas occupied by the enemy after the Siping campaign the previous year, forcing the enemy to shrink from \"mobile defense\" to the narrow lines of the Chinese Chang and Beining Railways, adopting the so-called \"key point defense.\" We then launched an offensive against Siping, a key point of the enemy's defense, inflicting a major blow on the enemy, and further forced the enemy to contract most of its main force to the strongholds around Shenyang. The summer offensive lasted for more than fifty days, annihilating more than 89,000 enemies and recovering 42 cities, linking our eastern, western, northern, and southern Manchuria and Rehe and eastern Hebei liberated areas into one, thereby changing the entire war situation in the Northeast. Du Yuming, the Northeast bandit leader who once clamored for \"receiving Harbin in three months,\" also rolled away with the disastrous defeat of the summer campaign. Replacing Du bandit was Jiang thief Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, who, as soon as he took office, also boasted: \"Turning the advantage in the Northeast in six months,\" and criticized Du Yuming's \"key point defense\" as a passive policy, advocating a return to \"mobile defense.\" However, just as his boasting was at its peak, he was hit head-on by the autumn offensive launched by our army in mid-September. Our army's offensive began with three battles and three victories along the Beining Railway, inflicting an annihilating blow on the main force of the 49th Army, which came to aid from afar, and largely annihilating the enemy's Provisional 22nd Division and Provisional 59th Division, cutting the Beining Line into several sections. In three days, we completely destroyed the Chinese Chang Railway, which the enemy had been rushing to repair for more than three months and was about to open to traffic. Then, dividing our troops north, we successively occupied Jiutai, Nong'an, Dehui, and all the strongholds around Ji(lin) and Chang(chun), making the two major cities of Ji and Chang completely isolated, becoming dead cities, shrinking back waiting for aid, and daring not to move out. The 21st and 43rd Divisions, which came to aid from eastern Hebei, were annihilated by us at Jiutai Pass, and the Provisional 3rd Army, which was transferred from Suiyuan, was hurriedly transferred back to Guan Nei because Shimen was liberated by us. The autumn offensive lasted for more than fifty days, annihilating more than 69,000 enemies. A total of thirty regular divisions, fourteen reorganized divisions, one cavalry division, and four cavalry brigades of the enemy troops were annihilated or repeatedly struck with annihilation. Fifteen cities were recovered, forcing the enemy to shrink into twenty-four large and small cities, most of which were cut off from coal, grain, and power sources, putting the enemy troops in the Northeast in an unprecedentedly serious predicament, while we have grasped the initiative of the entire war. The winter offensive, launched in December, has only begun for half a month, but has already annihilated more than 23,000 enemies and recovered 7 cities, forcing the enemy to draw from the east to supplement the west, in a panic. And our army's offensive is still unfolding vigorously. Under the blows of our increasingly powerful offensive operations, the Jiang bandits in the Northeast will fall into an irretrievable situation, and will eventually be completely annihilated. The liberation of all the people of the Northeast is getting closer and closer. (Editor's note: The talk only lists the results of each offensive. The total number of enemies annihilated by the Northeast People's Liberation Army in the past year, including the results of the battles between the offensives and the results of the local army's year of battles, as well as the results of our army in Jicha Rehe during the spring campaign, should be statistically combined to a total of more than 280,000).\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北解放军发言人谈：  战局已起根本变化　我军完全掌握主动\n\n1948-01-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北解放军发言人谈：\n    战局已起根本变化\n  　我军完全掌握主动\n    【新华社东北三日电】东北人民解放军司令部发言人顷就东北解放区一九四七年全年战绩总结发表谈话略称：一年来我军英勇作战，发动了四次强大的攻势，歼敌二十八万余，收复城市六十五座。使东北我军及早转入反攻，完全掌握战争的主动，迫使敌人处于全面防御，使东北战局发生了根本的变化。回溯一年来战局的变化：当前年（一九四六年）秋季蒋匪占领安东、通化及南满广大地区后，其进攻即已达顶点，但敌仍妄图采取南攻北守之势，于“肃清”南满后，转兵北越松花江。去年头三个月敌曾先后集中一切可能动员的兵力，对南满临江一带之狭小地区，连续进行了四次进攻。我军则以确保南北满根据地，打破敌“先南后北”之作战方针为目的，我南满部队当歼灭敌二五师，并对敌每次进攻，均给以歼灭打击。我北满部队则主动出击，进行了有名的“四下江南”的作战。使敌遭到南北夹击，各个歼灭，全部粉碎了敌“先南后北”的战略方针。总计春季攻势三个月作战，歼敌四万三千，收复城市十一座，基本上停止了东北敌人的战略性进攻，迫其转入全面防御。五月初我军以打通南北满两大战略区之联系，歼敌有生力量，收复失地，打开局面为目的，对分散守备之敌，从东西南满各战场，同时展开夏季攻势，在怀德、清原、梅河等地区，将敌七一军、新一军、六十军等主力部队大部或一部歼灭。敌之整个防御体系，由东西两面被打开两大缺口，中长路之长（春）沈（阳）段，吉（林）沈段交通线被切为数段。分散在海龙、东丰、老爷岭、西安、西丰、通化、安东、赤峰之敌，也都遭我全部或大部歼灭。由此我便收复了前年四平战役以后敌侵占之广大地区，迫敌由“机动防御”缩入中长及北宁狭长线上，探取所谓“重点防御”。我当又向敌防御重点之四平发动进攻，予敌重大打击，再迫使敌将大部主力收缩于沈阳外围各据点。夏季攻势共连续五十余天，歼敌八万九千余，收复城市四二座，使我东西南北满及热河、冀东等各解放区联成一片，从而改变了东北整个战局。曾一时叫嚣什么“三个月接收哈尔滨”的东北匪首杜聿明也随着夏季作战的惨败而滚了蛋。代替杜匪的是蒋贼参谋总长陈诚，刚一上台，也大肆吹牛：“六个月转变在东北的优势”，并斥责杜聿明的“重点防御”为消极方针，而主张重采“机动防御”。但其吹兴方浓时，便遭到我九月中旬开始发动的秋季攻势的当头棒。我军攻势首以三战三捷于北宁沿线展开，给远道来援的四九军主力以歼灭打击，并予敌暂廿二师及暂五十九师以大部歼灭，将北宁线切为数段，并在三日间将敌抢修三月有余即将通车之中长路完全平毁，随即分兵北上，先后攻占九台、农安、德惠及吉（林）长（春）外围之一切据点，使吉、长两大城市完全陷于孤立，成为死城，龟缩待援，不敢出动。其先后由冀东来援之二十一师及四十三师则于九台关门遭我歼灭打击，由绥远调来之暂三军，则因石门被我解放，又仓皇调回关内。秋季攻势共持续五十余日，歼敌六万九千余，被歼灭或一再被歼灭性打击之敌军共有三十个正规师，十四个整编师，一个骑兵师，四个骑兵旅等。收复城市十五座，迫敌龟缩于二十四个大小城市之内，大部被断绝了煤源、粮源、电源，使东北敌军陷于空前严重的困境，我则掌握了全部战争的主动权。十二月发起的冬季攻势，虽只开始半月，即已歼敌二万三千余，收复城市七座，迫敌抽东补西，慌作一团。而我军攻势犹正猛烈展开，在我一次比一次强大的攻势作战的打击下，东北蒋匪将落到无可挽救的局面，最后必将全部被歼。全东北人民的解放已日益接近了。（编者按：谈话中仅列举各次攻势战果，应将各次攻势间之战果及地方军一年战果与春季战役中冀察热辽我军战果统计合共东北解放军一年来歼敌总数为二十八万余）。"

    "content": "[This dispatch from our newspaper in Ji-Lu-Yu, dated the 31st] The Chiang Kai-shek bandits released floodwaters, causing the masses on both banks of the Yellow River to suffer greatly from the flood. In addition, this year, the Tai region experienced continuous rain, with flooded fields in only four districts of Hebei reaching 3.6 million mu, affecting nearly one million disaster victims. The current living conditions of these disaster-stricken masses are very difficult. To address this, the District Party Committee convened a meeting of local committees and decided to \"vigorously develop sideline production in disaster areas.\" The Administrative Office decided to allocate 1.2 billion yuan to relieve disaster-stricken hired and poor farmers. The District Administration, based on the Finance Office's instructions on winter loans, has decided on the following: (1) Winter loans this year must be fully extended to hired and poor farmers. (2) Winter loans in disaster areas should be under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels. Loan recipients should maintain direct contact with the bank, and procedures should be simplified as much as possible. (3) The newly allocated funds must be fully loaned to disaster areas. Loans to non-disaster areas should generally be avoided, except for extremely impoverished villages. (4) Bank loan funds must be fully extended to the masses. No Party or government agencies are allowed to misappropriate them. Any borrowed funds must be immediately recovered. (5) Local authorities should coordinate with the Party committee to create detailed and specific plans for winter loan needs and submit them in writing to the District Bank through the Finance Office by the end of December. (6) When issuing loans, local authorities should encourage the masses to voluntarily organize mutual aid and cooperation, but without excessive emphasis. Loans can also be granted individually to impoverished masses without organizational restrictions. (7) Generally, loans should not be granted to cooperatives at present. However, production mutual aid societies genuinely organized by impoverished masses in extremely poor villages can be appropriately supported if they face difficulties.\n    [This dispatch from our newspaper in Ji-Lu-Yu, dated the 31st] Liugu Village in the Fourth District of Qingfeng is preparing to intensify sideline production to overcome the spring famine. The village is a medium-level village, neither rich nor poor, with poor soil quality. Sandy soil accounts for 60%, and river land accounts for 20%. Only a good piece of land lies west of the village. The village has 241 households with 998 people. According to investigations, only 73 households have enough food. The remaining 168 households are short of more than 43,000 jin of grain until the next wheat harvest. The village masses plan to overcome the spring famine by opening small workshops and engaging in transportation. The village has a total of 36 households that regularly sell tofu, and 59 households that make iron tools, steamed buns, and pancakes for sale. There are 11 mutual aid teams, with a total of seven or eight large carts, 22 flatbed carts, and three small carts, running to Shunde and Handan all day long, carrying wheat and returning with iron goods. Bao Qiushan, who sells tofu, has a family of six. He planted 11 mu of autumn crops and harvested a total of 840 jin of grain, with 480 jin remaining. He is short of 196 jin of grain until the next wheat harvest. He is trying to sell tofu, averaging one a day, earning 1,600 yuan, which can buy one dou of sorghum (sorghum costs about 1,500 yuan per dou). Currently, the masses in the village are stepping up the opening of workshops and transportation production to prepare for overcoming the spring famine next year.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫救济黄河两岸灾民　行署拨款十二亿放给雇贫闹生产\n\n1948-01-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀鲁豫救济黄河两岸灾民\n    行署拨款十二亿放给雇贫闹生产\n    【本报冀鲁豫三十一日电】蒋匪放水后，我黄河两岸群众惨遭水灾，加之今年太区霪雨连绵，仅河北四个分区被淹田地即达三百六十万亩，灾民将近百万。这些灾区群众，目前生活已很感困难，为此，区党委召开各地委会议，决定：“大力开展灾区副业生产。”行署决定拨发款十二亿元救济灾区雇贫农民。区行根据财办关于今冬贷款问题的指示，决定下列各项：（一）今年冬季贷款要保证完全贷到雇贫农手里。（二）今冬灾区贷款由各级党委统一领导，贷款户仍与银行发生直接关系，手续要力求简便；（三）这次新拨资金要完全贷到灾区，关于非灾区贷款除十分贫苦村庄外，一般不贷；（四）银行贷款资金要保证完全贷给群众，不论党政机关一律不准挪借，经借出者要立即收回；（五）各地关于今冬贷款所需资金应协同党委作出详细具体计划，于十二月底以卷报区行转财办；（六）各地在发放贷款时，应注意启发群众自愿组织互助合作，但不过于强调，只要是贫苦群众亦可个别贷给，不应受组织限制；（七）目前合作社一般不贷给款，十分穷苦村庄真正由贫苦群众自愿组织起来的生产互助社，如有困难时，可适当予以扶助。\n    【本报冀鲁豫三十一日电】清丰四区留固村，准备加紧副业生产克服春荒。该村是个半穷不富的中等村，地质不好，半沙地占百分之六十，河地占百分之二十，只是村西边有一片好地，全村二百四十一户九百九十八口人，据调查只七十三户粮食够用，下余一百六十八户离明年麦子下来计算尚缺粮四万三千余斤。村里群众准备克服春荒的办法是：开小作坊，闹运输。全村共经常卖豆腐的三十六户，打铁卖馍及卖饼的五十九户。有互助组十一个，共七、八辆大车，平车廿二辆，三辆小车，整天往顺德、邯郸一带跑着，去时拉麦子，回来时拉铁货。卖豆腐的保秋山全家六口人，种秋十一亩，共收粮八百四十斤，现余四百八十斤，接到明年麦子下来尚差粮一百九十六斤，他设法卖豆腐，平均每天能卖一个，除本外赚洋一千六百元，可买一斗高粱（高粱每斗一千五百元左右）。现全村群众都在加紧开作坊和运输生产，准备渡过明年春荒。"

Among them, in addition to those killed and wounded, over 3,000 Chiang bandit troops were captured alive, including Zhang Xiaoliu, deputy brigade commander of the Kuomintang's reorganized Fourth Division, Ninetieth Brigade. After the People's Liberation Army destroyed the three defense lines of Chiang's bandits on the southern front at the beginning of last month and annihilated more than 9,000 enemies, the Chiang bandit Ministry of National Defense hastily gathered three regiments of the Ninetieth Brigade of the reorganized Fourth Division and two regiments of the reorganized Fifty-first Division (rebuilt after being completely annihilated in the Battle of Lunan) from the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and along the Grand Canal, totaling more than 17,000 men, to form the so-called \"Encirclement and Suppression Column.\" Led by Wang Yan, commander of the reorganized Fifty-first Division, they rushed to the southern front for emergency rescue, claiming to \"encircle and suppress\" our army. The enemy first searched empty in counties such as Dongtai and Rugao, and then retreated to Dongtai city. On the morning of the 26th, they again moved north along the Tong (Nantong) Yu (Ganyu) Highway. However, the People's Liberation Army had already set up an encirclement, waiting for the enemy's vanguard to enter the Ye Ting and Wu @ area before launching a full-scale attack. In just one hour, except for the 270th Regiment and part of the 268th Regiment of the bandit Ninetieth Brigade who escaped, the rest were cut into several sections and tightly surrounded by us. After four days and nights of fierce fighting, the battle ended on the night of the 29th, and most of the bandits were annihilated. According to preliminary investigations, the entire brigade headquarters of the Ninetieth Brigade of the reorganized Fourth Division and its affiliated 269th Regiment, one battalion of the 268th Regiment, the division headquarters of the reorganized Fifty-first Division and its affiliated 121st Regiment of the 41st Brigade, and most of the 338th Regiment of the 113th Brigade were annihilated. Detailed battle results are still being verified.\n\nXinhua News Agency, East China Front, 3rd: The Huazhong edition of Xinhua Daily (formerly Huazhong Daily, renamed from New Year's Day) published an editorial on New Year's Day, celebrating the great victory in Ye Nan, saying: \"The great victory in Ye Nan is a great victory in which the Central China People's Liberation Army victoriously opened the prelude to a large-scale counter-offensive. It is a generous New Year's gift from the Chiang Kai-shek and Gu Zhutong bandits to the military and civilians of Central China, offering more than 7,000 troops of the 'Encirclement and Suppression Column' led by Wang Yan, commander of the reorganized Fifty-first Division, to the People's Liberation Army. This great victory shows the strength of the Central China military and civilians, who can not only fight a good all-people's guerrilla war, but also fight mobile and flexible large-scale mobile warfare, and each time they fight larger and fiercer, with improved technology and combat effectiveness than in the past.\" Talking about the future situation, the editorial said: \"The Central China People's Liberation Army has grasped all the initiative, can advance to the Yangtze in the south and threaten Nanjing and Shanghai, can directly attack the Longhai Railway in the north and cooperate with Shandong, and can control the Grand Canal in the west and liberate both Huainan and Huaibei (and Huaiyin and Huai'an). They can rest when they want to rest, and fight when they want to fight. Although Chiang's bandits may still piece together troops to retaliate and 'sweep,' who can guarantee that they will not repeat the mistakes of the 'Encirclement and Suppression Column'?\" The editorial called on the military and civilians of Central China to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions, not to be dizzy with victory, complacent and complacent, but to use their greatest efforts, work hard, and boldly and courageously advance into all areas behind Chiang, recover lost territories, and be vigilant and smash any desperate struggles of Chiang's bandits, vigorously strengthen the People's Liberation Army, and better fight hard battles and mobile warfare to complete the task of a large-scale counter-offensive and the liberation of Central China.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华中反攻旗开得胜　叶南歼敌七千　大军可南逼长江北捣陇海\n\n1948-01-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华中反攻旗开得胜\n  　叶南歼敌七千\n    大军可南逼长江北捣陇海\n    【新华社华东前线三日电】华中解放军在叶挺（即盐城）到伍＠（在叶挺东南）地区歼灭蒋匪“进剿”部队七千多人，其中除毙伤外，活捉蒋匪整四师九十旅副旅长张晓柳以下三千多人。上月初旬解放军在南线摧毁蒋匪三道防线，歼敌九千多人后，蒋匪国防部慌忙从陇海线东段和运河沿线抽集整四师九十旅三个团和整五十一师（按系鲁南战役全歼后重建者）所属两个团，共一万七千多人，组织所谓“进剿纵队”，由整五十一师师长王严率领，赶到南线救急，扬言要“进剿”我军。该敌先在东台、如皋等县扑了空，缩回东台城。二十六日清早又沿通（南通）榆（赣榆）公路北犯，但解放军已布置好包围圈，等匪先头部队进到叶挺和伍＠一带就全面出击，仅一小时，除匪九十旅的二七○团和二六八团一部逃脱外，其余被我截成几段，紧紧包围。激战四昼夜，到二十九日夜结束战斗，匪大部被歼。据已查明者，歼匪整四师九十旅旅部和所属二六九团全部，二六八团一个营，整五十一师师部和所属四十一旅一二一团以及一一三旅三三八团大部，详细战果正清查中。\n    【新华社华东前线三日电】新华日报华中版（按系华中日报，元旦起改称）在元旦发表社论，庆祝叶南大捷说：“叶南的大捷，是华中人民解放军胜利揭开大举反攻序幕的大捷，是蒋介石、顾祝同匪徒送给我华中军民的一份新年厚礼，把整五十一师师长王严所率的‘进剿纵队’七千多人马献给了解放军。这一大捷说明华中军民力量的壮大，不仅能打好全民的游击战争，又能打机动灵活的大规模运动战，而且一次比一次打得大、打得猛，技术和战斗力都比过去提高了”。谈到今后的形势时，社论说：“华中解放军已掌握一切主动权，南可进逼长江、威胁京沪，北可直捣陇海、配合山东，西可控制运河、解放两淮（淮南淮北和淮阴淮安），要休整就休整，要打仗就打仗。虽说蒋匪还可能再拼凑兵力来报复‘扫荡’，谁能担保不重蹈‘进剿纵队’的覆辙。”社论号召华中军民，要坚决执行毛主席的指示，不要被胜利冲昏头脑，麻痹自满，而应用最大努力，艰苦奋斗，大胆勇猛向所有蒋后地区进军，收复失地，并警惕和粉碎蒋匪任何垂死挣扎，猛力壮大解放军，更好地打攻坚战和运动战，来完成大举反攻、解放华中的任务。"

It is intended to explain the important news of the day to the masses in simple terms. Please pay attention to this in all regions.)\n\nAttention all villagers! We now have even better ways to equally distribute land! After the Chinese Communist Party's Land Law Outline was published, our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region issued another order, requiring all military personnel to support the Land Law Outline. If local bad elements try to sabotage or resist the equal distribution of land, the military personnel must support us and take charge, and cannot ignore it. Landlords and rich peasants in the military must be of one mind with us, the hired and poor peasants. They must not protect their families, and even more so, they must not come up with bad ideas for their families. No one in the military, whether soldiers or officers, can buy cheaply or seize the fruits of our peasants' struggle. When we distribute land equally, we must establish our own poor peasant leagues, peasant associations, and peasant representative conferences. Once we have held meetings and made decisions, the officers and soldiers in the military who come to the village must act according to our decisions and absolutely cannot sabotage them. The order also states: If the officers and soldiers in the military do not act according to the above, our peasant organizations and the government can tie them up and send them to the military for legal punishment.\n\nIn the past, the military in our border region fought and shed blood to defend the land and property we were allocated. They were sincerely working for us. However, there were also a small number of people, some of whom were from landlord and rich peasant families, some of whom were married to landlord's daughters, and some of whom were landlords and rich peasants who had infiltrated. They relied on their guns to protect the landlords, acting as \"air raid shelters,\" and sabotaged our liberation. With this order, we have a way to deal with it. In the future, if we encounter such situations again, we can act according to the order. If they do not listen, we can hand them over to the responsible military organs for legal punishment.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 大众黑板\n\n1948-01-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　大众黑板\n    （本栏专供乡村黑板报、屋顶广播、读报组、工作人员采用，通俗给群众解释本日重要新闻，请各地注意。）\n    全村农民注意！咱们今后平分土地，更有办法了！中国共产党的土地法大纲发表后，咱们晋冀鲁豫军区又下了一道命令，叫所有军队人员，都要拥护土地法大纲。地方坏蛋们谁要破坏或者抵抗平分土地，军队里的人就要给咱们撑腰作主，不能不管。军队里地主富农成份的人都得和咱们雇贫农民一条心，不能包庇家，更不能给家里出坏主意。军队里不论当兵的当官的，谁也不能贱买霸占咱们农民的斗争果实。咱们平分土地，要成立自己的贫农团、农会、农代会。咱们开了会作了决定，军队里的当官和当兵的到了村里都要按咱们的决定办事，绝对不能破坏。命令中还说：军队里的官兵，如果不按以上所说的话办事，咱们农民团体和政府可以把他捆起来，送给军队按法处罚他。\n    过去咱们边区的军队，为保卫咱们分到的土地财产打仗流血，他们是真心为咱们办事的。但也有一少部分人，他们有些是地主富农出身的人，有些是和地主女儿结了婚的，有些就是地主富农混进来的，他们依仗自己有枪，便包庇地主，当“防空洞”，破坏了咱们翻身。有了这条命令，咱们就有办法了，以后再遇这类事情，咱们就可以按照命令所说的办事，他们不听从，就可以送交军队负责机关依法惩办。"

    "content": "Opinions on Popularization\n    ·Zhou Fang·\n\nComrade Editor:\n\nYou say that we should read the newspaper to the masses immediately. Is this suggestion correct? Reading immediately lacks research time. It should be researched first, and then reading the newspaper should be organized in a planned way. Reading to the masses should not be indiscriminate; it should first be read to poor peasants and farm laborers, and then general propaganda should be conducted. When reading, it should be connected to the local reality. Situations that do not exist locally can be omitted. Use popular and appropriate language. For example, a poor peasant with one person can be allocated land for two people; here the masses call it \"double portion.\" These are experiences gained from reading.\n\nRecently, when drafting laws, I always used popular and mass language, but still cannot get everyone to agree. It seems that laws must be written in classical Chinese. I believe that with the poor and hired laborers in charge, it is not just a matter of changing a few leading cadres, but a complete set of reforms in all aspects. For writing, it is also within the scope of reform. Whether it is a proclamation, law, newspaper, or telegram, it should be changed to popular and mass language. Past opinions are that popular mass language is verbose and not concise. They don't know that truly refined mass language is concise, while intellectual's vernacular Chinese is verbose. Another opinion is that reading materials for cadres can or should be written in classical Chinese (especially laws). They don't know that cadres who can understand classical Chinese are only from landlord and wealthy peasant backgrounds and have attended school for many years. This time, when I went to the countryside, I saw that many district and county cadres were from peasant backgrounds. Our writing should be adapted to them. There is also a saying that popular and mass language can be used for writing articles, such as Zhao Shuli's novels, but cannot be used for laws and telegrams. This is truly an old saying that has existed since the May Fourth Movement, preserving territory for classical Chinese. Now that land reform is being carried out and the poor and hired laborers are in charge, this saying will also fall with it. Therefore, I am extremely happy to see your vernacular telegram today.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 对通俗化的意见\n周方\n1948-01-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　对通俗化的意见\n    ·周方·编辑同志：\n    你们说要马上向群众读报，这样提是否正确？马上读，就缺乏研究时间，应是研究一下，再有计划的组织读报，向群众读，就没有先后对象，应是先向贫雇读，再作一般宣传，读时要与当地实际连系，当地实际没有的情况，可以不读，要用通俗恰当的语言，比如一口人的贫雇可以分二口人的地，这里群众叫顶双份，这些是从读中体验得来。\n    我最近起草法令，总用通俗大众语，但仍不能使人人同意，似乎法令一定应是文言，我以为雇贫当家，不单是改换几个领导骨干的问题，是一整套的各方面的改革，对于文字，也在改革之内，不管是布告，法令，报纸，电讯都要改为通俗大众语。过去的意见，一是说通俗大众语罗唆，不能简洁，不知真的洗练的大众语，是简练的，知识分子的白话文，才是罗唆嗦的，一是说干部读物可以是文言，或者应该是文言（特别是法令），不知能懂文言的干部，只是地富出身，进过多年学校的，我这次下乡，见区县干部，很多都是农民出身，我们的文字，应该适应他们。还有一说，认为通俗大众语，写文章可用，赵树理写小说可用，而法令电讯，就不可用，这真是“五四”以来多年的旧说，为文言文保存地盘，现在土地改革，雇贫当家，这一说也随之而倒，所以我今天看到你们的语体电讯，真是高兴极了。"

Chiang Kai-shek's Fourth and Sixth Security Brigades of Sichuan Province have been sent to defend. Nine counties including Bazhong and Jiange have established a \"Joint Command\", and four counties, Wanyuan, Tongjiang, Nanjiang, and Bazhong, have also established a \"Joint Defense Military Office.\" All counties are also mobilizing laborers to build bunkers and repair roads, and the people are full of complaints.

Chiang Kai-shek's Southwest Chongqing Headquarters was extremely panicked and urgently ordered the Chiang Kai-shek authorities of the three provinces to establish a \"Joint Defense Command\" in an attempt to \"suppress\" the popular uprising armed forces there. In addition, a popular uprising armed force of more than 1,000 in southwestern Guangxi arrived near Longjin (Longzhou). The Chiang Kai-shek authorities in Guangxi Province had no troops to deploy and could only send local militias to resist, which was extremely anxious.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st: According to Chiang Kai-shek's district report: The popular uprising armed forces in Yunnan are extremely active recently. In Kaiyuan, Gejiu, Jianshui, Shiping, and nearby Pingbian counties along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the Gejiu-Bisezhai branch line, there are popular uprising armed forces led by Xu Shihao, Long Yonghe, Bai Zhenggui, Bai Xiaoqi, and Xiong Shanzheng, with a total of more than 1,000 people and guns. They have won victories in counter-\"suppression\" this month. Xiong's troops once entered Pingbian County on October 27, parading in the streets and demonstrating, without committing any crimes against citizens and merchants. Chiang Kai-shek's government was extremely panicked and dared not intervene.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 川滇黔桂各地民变武装活跃\n\n1948-01-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　川滇黔桂各地民变武装活跃\n    【新华社陕北三十日电】沪讯：我鄂豫皖及豫陕鄂两路反攻大军，深入鄂西、陕南，迫近四川东北边境后，该地米仓山区的南江、通江、巴中、苍溪、广元，摩天岭南区的江油、剑阁、平武、北川、茂县等地民变武装更趋活跃，贫苦农民在抗粮、抗丁、抗税反土劣的口号下纷纷起义。蒋匪重庆行辕对此慌张异常，匆忙召开“西南各省军政会议”。蒋匪四川省府亦召开“川东北十五县防务会议”，成立“川省军事委员会”及川东、川西、成都三警备司令部，下令各县应不分地域进攻民变武装。重庆并拟设立“华蓉山清剿指挥所”。川、陕边境号称川省门户的大巴山一带，蒋匪更风声鹤唳。蒋匪川省保安队四、六两总队，已开往防守。巴中、剑阁等九县已成立“联合指挥部”，万源、通江、南江、巴中四县，亦设立“联防军事处”，各县并大拉民夫赶筑碉堡修建公路，人民怨声载道。另据本月中旬津报透露：蒋匪已因民变范围扩大，特派美制轰炸机一队入川。\n    【新华社陕北卅日电】据本月廿日津报透露：滇、黔、桂边境邱北、广义、兴义、安龙、西降、西林等县，有民变武装罗日辉部活动。蒋匪西南重庆行辕慌张异常，已急令三省蒋匪当局设立“联防指挥所”，妄图借此“清剿”该处民变武装。又，桂西南民变武装一股千余，进抵龙津（龙州）附近，蒋匪桂省当局无兵可调，只能派民团前往招架，焦急异常。\n    【新华社陕北三十一日电】据蒋区讯：滇民变武装近极活跃。沿滇越铁路及个碧石支路之开远、个旧、建水、石屏及附近之屏边等县区，地区，有民变武装许世好、龙永和、白正贵、白小七及熊山正等部，共有人枪千余，本月中进行反“清剿”已获胜利。熊部并曾于十月二十七日一度进入屏边县城，在街上游行示威，对市民及商家秋毫无犯，蒋匪政府恐慌异常，不敢过问。"

    "content": "[Reported by our newspaper from Shahe] In Zhengzhao Village, during an in-depth investigation into the production difficulties of hired and poor peasants, it was discovered that because the hired and poor peasants did not have power to manage affairs, the fruits of labor allocated by the Farmers' Association were not distributed to the masses. At the 54 meetings of male and female hired and poor peasants, those who were reluctant to speak out began to take action after several days of investigation, mobilization, and assistance in solving their difficulties. In the review, Zhang Ju said: \"The grain I harvested last year was not enough to eat. This year, even after wearing the 'turnover hat,' I still can't make ends meet. I couldn't afford to water the seedlings, so I had to go out and work for a few days before I could water them. After putting away the hoe, I worked as a carpenter for a few more days to buy some wheat seeds. But then I worried about plowing and harrowing the land because I didn't have any livestock. Later, I tightened my belt and sold some cloth and a bag of grain to buy some. Now that I have livestock, I don't even have fodder.\" Qi Zheng said: \"We three families share a broken donkey. When planting, everyone wants to plant first. Later, we sold the donkey and bought a smaller one, still owing more than ten thousand yuan. The waterwheels and carts distributed to each team by the Farmers' Association have been left unused for a year because the middle peasants already have them. People with livestock use the carts for transportation, but only two of the seven carts in our third team are still usable. For households with waterwheels, either the buckets are missing, or they have all been replaced.\" Zhang Bing of the sixth team said: \"Our team didn't get any waterwheels. The middle peasants, who have livestock, just pull them over and use them, and some even put their own waterwheels aside and use the ones from the team.\" Hou Bai of the second team said: \"Our team leader (three middle peasants, one bankrupt landlord, and two poor peasants) let the middle peasants occupy the waterwheels. Their land is all in large plots of more than ten mu each. Once they're set up, they don't move. Our allocated land is one mu here and two mu there. When we want to use the waterwheel, they say: Can't you just use a well winch to water your little bit of land? We shouldn't use waterwheels because we have so little land.\" Ma Chenyou of the fifth team said: \"Also, the Farmers' Association distributed two looms to each team, with thread on them, but they haven't been distributed yet. The parts on the machines are all gone, and no one can use them.\" Hou Fulai said: \"Speaking of the distribution of fruits, I have a lot of complaints. In the past, my children and I worked as long-term laborers outside, and the women begged for food at home. Since the arrival of the Eighth Route Army, we've barely managed to survive. Later, during the struggle and distribution of fruits, our family didn't get anything, and we didn't dare to ask for it. The village cadres gave me a few mu of poor land that no one else wanted. When I wanted to exchange it for better land, I went to the director of the Farmers' Association, and he said: You still complain about the poor land? How much money did you contribute? From then on, I never said another word. I see that the middle peasants are much better off than us, and the land they got is better. Shi Zhenguo, the director, feeds two mules, wears woolen clothes and cotton-padded coats, and even wears a leather coat on top; he smokes cigarettes every day, which is enough for my family to eat millet.\" Li Xi said: \"Speaking of this, I'm even more miserable. My family has nothing. A few days ago, my wife was in confinement, and there was no fire in the house, and no oil for the lamp. My wife sat on the cold kang, unable to move. I held her, and finally my mother brought a lamp of oil and helped me take care of the child. After the child was born, I bought two jin of white flour, but my wife couldn't bear to eat it. In the autumn, I bought a donkey, but by autumn there was no grass. I couldn't borrow any, and I didn't have money to buy any. I decided to sell the donkey. The team called me to a meeting and asked if I had any difficulties. I explained the situation, and the cadres asked me to haul coal to barely survive.\" Then everyone reviewed the past distribution of fruits and the work style of the cadres. Many middle peasant households received more fruits than the hired and poor peasants. Li Xi also said: \"Look at those councilors, they are all middle peasants. How can the distribution be fair?\" Qi Zheng said: \"See who is running the village?\" Some said it was the councilors, some said it was the village chief and director, and some said it was the leaders of the large and small teams. Bai said: \"There are six or seven leaders of large and small teams in our street, but only two of them are poor peasants. How can they be close to us?\" Then everyone started to investigate to see who actually controlled the village. Among the 46 cadres and leaders of large and small teams in the village, only 18 were poor and hired peasants, 26 were middle peasants, and 2 were bankrupt landlords. Among the poor and hired peasants, there were also a few who were ineffective. The power was all in the hands of the middle peasant cadres. From then on, everyone clearly realized that they suffered a great loss because they had no power.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 正招村贫雇反对分果实不公　大车水车分给互助组　贫雇没权想用不能用\n荣的　太山　奎林\n1948-01-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　正招村贫雇反对分果实不公\n    大车水车分给互助组\n  　贫雇没权想用不能用\n    【本报沙河讯】正招村在深入检查雇贫农民的生产困难中，发现了因为雇贫没当权管事，农会分配果实没分到群众手中。在五十四个男女雇贫会上，不好吭气的人，经过几天来的检查发动和帮助解决困难，一部分雇贫开始行动起来。在检讨中张具的说：“去年我打的粮食就不够吃，今年戴上‘翻身帽’还是吃不下来，浇不起小苗，还出去做了几天活才浇了苗。挂锄钩后又去干了几天木匠活，才买了些麦种，可是犁耩地又发愁，没牲口使，后来就紧紧裤腰带卖了些布和一布袋粮食才买下，有了牲口，当下连草料都没有”。齐正的说：“俺们三家伙着一个破驴，种地时谁也想先种，后来把驴卖了，换个小驴，还欠一万多元钱。农会里分到各组的水车大车，因为中农们有的使，放了一年不给分，人家有牲口拉上大车搞运输，俺第三组七辆大车到如今只有两辆能用了。有水车的户不是把斗子没了，就是都换了。”第六大组张兵的说：“俺组的水车没分，中农有牲口拉上就去使换了，有些把自己的水车放下用组内的水车。”第二大组侯白的说：“俺组的组长（三个中农一个破落地主两个贫农）把水车让中农们占住了，人家的地一片都是十几亩，安上就不动了，咱分的地这里一亩，那里二亩，咱想使吧，人家说：你那一点地不会安上辘辘浇吗？咱这地少就不该使水车”。第五组马臣有说：“还有农会分到每组两个织布机，上边还带着线子，至今没分，把机上的零件都没有了，谁也不能用”。侯福来说：“说起分果实来我很有意见，过去我和俺孩在外边当长工，妇女在家要饭吃，自从八路军过来，算糊住吃了。后来搞斗争分果实咱家里啥也没有，也不敢说要，村干部把别人都不要的赖地分给了我几亩，我想换点好地，就去找农会主任，他说：你还嫌地赖哩？你出了几个钱？从那时我再也不吭一声了。眼看着中农们比咱时光强的多，比咱得的地还好，石振国当了主任，喂着两条骡子，穿着毛衣棉袄，外边还披着大皮袄；每天吸纸烟，就够俺一家吃小米。”李锡说：“说起这事我更苦了，我家里啥都没有，前几天老婆坐月子，家里连火都没生，灯也没油，老婆坐在凉炕沿上，生下小孩就板在凉炕上，老婆凉的也不能动了，我就扶住她，好容易满的娘才给拿来一灯油，帮助我收拾起孩子来。生下小孩来秤了二斤白面，老婆都舍不得吃。秋天买下一头驴，到秋后没有草了，借借不下，买吧没钱，我打定主意要卖驴，组里叫我开会，问我有啥困难，我说了说，干部就叫我拉起煤来，才算糊住嘴。”接着大家把过去分配果实、干部作风等都作了检查，好多中农户比雇贫分的果实还多。李锡又说：“咱看看那些评议员都是些中农，怎样能分配公平了？”齐正的说：“看看村里的事是谁当着家呢？”有的说是评议员，有的说是村长、主任，有的说是大小组长。白的说：“俺街大小组长六、七个，只有两个是贫农，你算算怎能和咱们近呢？”随即大家展开检查，看看村里的大权到底掌握在谁手？全村四十六个干部和大小组长，其中贫雇农只有十八个，中农二十六个，破落地主两个，贫雇中还有几个不顶事，大权都掌握在中农干部手中。从此大家都明确认识到自己没权才吃了大亏。（荣的、太山、奎林）"

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 3rd:\n\n　　Our army in Jiaodong completely defeated eight brigades of Chiang Kai-shek bandits who were re-invading Laiyang in the southwest of Laiyang. Pursuing them south for over a hundred li, from December 14th to the end of the month, we annihilated another 4,600 enemy soldiers. Adding to the 3,500+ enemy soldiers annihilated during the previous (December 10th-13th) blocking action, the total annihilation reached 8,100+ enemy soldiers. On the evening of the 4th of last month, when the Liberation Army began to encircle and annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Laiyang city, the bandit chiefs Chiang Kai-shek and Fan Hanjie hastily gathered eight brigades of troops: two brigades from the reorganized 64th Division, all three brigades from the reorganized 54th Division, the 76th Brigade of the reorganized 9th Division, the 42nd Brigade of the Rong 1st Division of the reorganized 8th Army, and the 57th Brigade of the New 74th Division, totaling eight brigades, from Qingdao and Jimo to reinforce northward. They were intercepted by our forces at every step. In the four days from the 10th to the 13th, we annihilated over 3,500 enemy soldiers (as reported previously). When our army captured Laiyang on the evening of the 13th, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits reinforcing from the north were still over fifty li away from Laiyang city, held up in the area south of Shuigoutou. On the 14th, our blocking forces, having completed their mission, took the initiative to withdraw from Shuigoutou. At this time, the greedy and cowardly Chiang Kai-shek bandits cautiously passed through the area and ventured north. Except for the 57th and 76th Brigades guarding the traffic line from Lingshan to Shuigoutou, the remaining six brigades, fearing annihilation, crowded together along the way, crawling along under the cover of tanks, airplanes, and howitzers. The Liberation Army continuously struck them, and the enemy only advanced thirty li in ten days, finally crawling to the Taoyuanzhuang line, eighteen li southwest of Laiyang, on the 23rd. For three days, from the 23rd to the 25th, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, under the cover of six tanks, attacked Hejiatuan and Jiangjunding to the east. Two enemy tanks were destroyed by us, and one was captured, along with a tank operator. Our positions stood firm. At this time, another unit of the Liberation Army suddenly inserted itself behind the Chiang Kai-shek bandits on the evening of the 24th, cutting off their traffic line from Lingshan to Shuigoutou in one fell swoop. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits, fearing annihilation by our army, were shaken across the board and turned south to flee in disarray on the 26th, retreating dozens of li in a single day, regardless of the strong winds and heavy snow. On the 28th, our army recovered Shuigoutou and immediately pursued them south. By the 30th, our army had crossed Jiangshanjie (sixty li north of Jimo) and advanced towards Lingshan. At present, there is no trace of the enemy in the vast area north of Lingshan. In total, from the 14th to the end of the month, we continued to annihilate over 4,600 enemy soldiers. Thus, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits reinforcing Laiyang were annihilated by a total of 8,100+ soldiers. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits' dream of reoccupying Laiyang under the command of American imperialism has finally been shattered.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 胶东我军击溃蒋匪八个旅　莱阳西南歼敌四千\n\n1948-01-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　胶东我军击溃蒋匪八个旅\n  　莱阳西南歼敌四千\n    【新华社华东前线三日电】解放军在莱阳西南地区完全击溃再犯莱阳蒋匪八个旅，向南追击百余里，自十二月十四日迄月底止，再歼敌四千六百余名。连前（十二月十日至十三日）阻击战中歼敌三千五百余，共歼敌八千一百余名。上月四日晚，当解放军开始围歼莱阳城蒋匪之际，匪首蒋介石、范汉杰即仓皇纠集整六四师两个旅、整五四师全部三个旅及整九师之七六旅、整八军荣一师之四二旅、新七四师之五七旅共八个旅兵力，自青岛、即墨向北增援，当被我节节阻击，十日至十三日四天中，歼敌三千五百余名（已见前报）。当十三日晚我军攻克莱阳时，北援蒋匪尚远离莱阳城五十余里，被阻滞于水沟头以南地区。十四日，我阻击部队以任务已达，乃主动撤离水沟头。此时，贪婪而胆怯的蒋匪，才小心翼翼通过该地向北窜犯。除以五七、七六两旅守备灵山至水沟头一线交通外，其余六个旅惟恐被歼，沿途挤成一团，在坦克、飞机、榴弹炮掩护下，龟步爬行。解放军当予连续打击，敌十日中仅前进三十余里，至二十三日才爬至莱阳西南十八里之桃园庄一线。二十三至二十五日三天，蒋匪以六辆坦克掩护东犯禾家疃及将军顶，被我击毁坦克二辆，缴获一辆，俘坦克手一名，我阵地屹立未动。此时解放军另部已于二十四日晚突然插入蒋匪背后，一举截断其灵山至水沟头的交通，蒋匪惧于我军之歼灭打击，全线震动，乃于二十六日扭头向南回窜，顾不得狂风大雪，一日溃退数十里。二十八日，我军收复水沟头，并即向南跟踪追击，迄三十日，我军已越过姜山集（在即墨北六十里）进迫灵山。现灵山以北广大地区已无敌踪。总计十四日迄月底，我续歼敌四千六百余名。至此，增援莱阳蒋匪共被歼八千一百余名。蒋匪在美帝国主义命令下企图重占莱阳的迷梦，终告粉碎。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-05",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th—Comprehensive report: Over the past year, workers in the KMT-controlled areas have launched heroic struggles against the Chiang Kai-shek gang's starvation policies and oppressive suppression, demonstrating great strength. According to extremely incomplete statistics published in a report by Zhang Dianxun: In the past year, at least 1.2 million workers participated in the struggle, covering more than twenty cities of all sizes, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Qingdao, Jinan, Zhengzhou, Guangzhou, Shantou, and Hong Kong and Kowloon. In addition, all postal workers in the KMT-controlled areas held a hunger strike to demand improved treatment. In Shanghai, the industrial center of the KMT-controlled areas, nearly one million workers were directly involved in the struggle, including laborers in more than fifty industries such as water and electricity, transportation, telecommunications, postal services, railways, machinery, cotton textile, silk weaving, knitting, dyeing, hosiery, chemical, rubber, cigarette, Western medicine, printing, underwear, handkerchief, Western clothing, department store, insurance, customs, shipping, wharf, and rickshaw. In September alone, 247 labor disputes occurred in the city, exceeding the monthly average of 107 cases from January to June of the previous year by a margin of about three-fifths.\n\nAccording to statistics published by the Chiang bandit authorities in Shanghai: In April, labor disputes caused by layoffs and re-employment accounted for 44% of the total for that month; in May, labor disputes caused by demands for improved treatment accounted for 27% of the total for that month; and in September, strikes and slowdowns caused by anti-oppression and the fight for freedom accounted for 7% of the total for that month. This illustrates that Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous, dictatorial, and anti-people rule has caused inflation, soaring prices, the monopoly of bureaucratic capital, and the dumping of American goods, deepening the crisis of national industry and commerce, thus forcing workers to struggle for survival, which is the fundamental reason for the widespread labor unrest. This year, in February, the Chiang bandit gang issued the \"Economic Emergency Measures Program,\" attacking laborers, freezing wages at the January level, and implementing a starvation policy; and in August, the reactionary \"General Mobilization Order\" was issued, prohibiting strikes and slowdowns, vainly attempting to destroy the workers' basic rights to freedom, further arousing the upsurge of the broad masses of workers striving for survival, democracy, and freedom.\n\nThe Chiang family fascist bandits, fearing the threat of the workers, adopted only inhuman suppression and devastation. During the major strike of water, electricity, and transportation workers in Shanghai in September, more than a hundred workers were arrested. The Chiang bandit authorities vainly attempted to control the city's trade unions, and offered a reward of 100,000 yuan for the arrest of Ouyang Ren, the leader of the workers of the French-owned tram company, threatening to suppress them with the Youth Army's 202nd Division, and announcing that those who refused to return to work would be \"shot on the spot.\" They even openly shot workers at the Jiaoji Railway Bureau in Jinan and the clothing factory in Wuhan.\n\nThe workers' response to the atrocities of the Chiang family fascist bandits was a powerful counterattack. During the anti-\"Emergency Measures Program\" period in Shanghai, the workers gave an open letter to the Chiang bandit municipal government, demanding the unfreezing of the index and warning: \"If you attempt to use force, serious consequences will occur.\" Thousands of radio workers blocked radio communications between Shanghai and domestic and foreign countries, condemning the Chiang bandit authorities for \"insufficient meals, which sharply reduced our efficiency and ability.\" More than two thousand employees of the British-owned Automobile Company marched in a procession carrying the banner of the British-owned trade union, and when the Chiang bandit authorities formed a line of defense with five red police cars and armed police, the employees roared \"Fight!\" \"Charge!\" clenched their fists, and advanced under the bayonets and machine guns of the Chiang bandit police, with thousands of fists ready to hit the heads of these bastards at any time. Under the workers' magnificent momentum, the Chiang bandit police retreated in fear. In July, three thousand workers of the Jiaoji Railway Bureau in Jinan angrily beat Chen Shun'geng, the bureau director, for his murderous rule, forcing Chen to resign in a state of embarrassment. Gao Weishu, the manager of the Chiang bandit Qingdao Transportation Company in June, and the director of the Chiang bandit shipyard in that area in November, both feared the workers' momentum and were forced to apologize to the workers and resign or slip away.\n\nUnder the cruel oppression of the Chiang family fascist bandits, the workers demonstrated a closer unity of class brothers. The grand momentum of the Shanghai workers' anti-\"Emergency Measures Program\" forced the Chiang bandit authorities to promise to amend some of the measures, and the workers immediately focused on exposing and opposing: \"This measure is limited to Shanghai only, and employees in other regions still cannot live.\" The Shanghai French Electric workers encouraged the British Electric workers who were suppressed by the Chiang bandit authorities for marching and petitioning, saying: \"If you fight them (referring to the Chiang family bandits) well, we will follow up, and the workers of the entire Shanghai will support you.\" When the anti-oppression and freedom-seeking movement of water, electricity, and transportation workers in Shanghai in September was bloodily devastated by the Chiang bandit authorities, the spokesman of the French Electric Workers' Union announced: \"If anyone in the union is arrested, all workers will simultaneously demand imprisonment.\" At the end of June, 160 of the 400 workers of the Chiang bandit Transportation Company in Qingdao were laid off, and the laid-off workers opposed it, and the remaining employees used a strike to provide assistance. The city's trade union also launched a city-wide fundraising effort involving 70,000 workers to help the strike of the workers of the bureaucratic capital's Qilu Company. Due to the workers' heroic struggle and fraternal unity, they repeatedly frustrated the suppression and division of the Chiang bandits, making the Chiang family gang embarrassed and overwhelmed.\n\nIn addition to devastation and suppression, the Chiang family gang's consistent tactic against the workers' movement is to spread rumors and slanders, adding charges such as \"disturbing social order\" and \"obstructing traffic\" to the workers, but the facts are a ruthless mockery of all this. During the strike of the employees of the American-owned Water and Electricity Company in September, they still tried every means to supply electricity to users, and the workers' marches, petitions, and other actions were organized and orderly. What the workers want to destroy is only the traitorous and dictatorial order of the Chiang family gang that makes it impossible for the people to live, and the workers are fighting for the people's democratic order and happy life. And the Chiang family fascist bandits always disrupt and hinder the workers' actions in every way, which is precisely \"disturbing social order\" and \"undermining public security.\" The broad social sympathy belongs to the workers.\n\nAlthough the workers' struggle in the KMT-controlled areas in the past year is still rising and falling and is uneven, the nature of the struggle has long exceeded the scope of economic struggle. The workers have a clearer understanding of the anti-people and murderous faces of the Chiang family gang from their own personal experience, and deeply realize that only by ending this rule can they seek survival, democracy, and freedom. They are also increasingly aware of the great historical task on their shoulders. In May, the Shanghai mass trade union organization issued a declaration, urging Shanghai workers to \"fight for true peace, to punish war traffickers (Chiang Kai-shek and his partners), and to establish democracy,\" and called on Shanghai workers to \"oppose conscription, requisition of grain, indiscriminate issuance of currency, exorbitant taxes, and using foreign debt to fight civil war.\" Workers in the KMT-controlled areas are continuing to expand the struggle, and are tempering and improving themselves in the struggle, uniting all working people to cooperate with the patriotic liberation war of the People's Liberation Army in a great counteroffensive, and fighting for the great goal of overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek and establishing a new China.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋管区工人奋战一年　认清只有打倒蒋介石独裁才能获得生存民主和自由\n\n1948-01-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋管区工人奋战一年\n    认清只有打倒蒋介石独裁才能获得生存民主和自由\n    【新华社陕北二十七日电】综合报导：一年来蒋管区工人为反对蒋家匪帮的饥饿政策，和压迫镇压政策，展开了英勇的斗争，表现了伟大的力量。据报张电讯发表的极不完全材料统计：一年来参加斗争的工人最少在一百二十余万人以上，地区包括沪、京、平、津、武汉、杭州、宁波、青岛、济南、郑州、广州、汕头以及香港、九龙等二十余个大小城市，且全蒋管区的邮务职工为要求改善待遇举行了绝食运动。蒋管区工业中心城市之上海，先后直接卷入斗争的工人即达百万左右，包括水电、交通、电讯、邮务、铁路、机器、棉纺织、丝织、针织、染织、织袜、化学、橡胶、卷烟、西药、印刷、内衣、手帕、西服、百货、保险、海关、轮船、码头、三轮等五十余业的劳工，均参加斗争。全市仅九月一个月内发生工潮达二百四十七件，超过去年一至六月每月平均件数一百零七件之五分之三弱。\n    据沪市蒋匪官方发表之统计：四月份因解雇及复工而引起之工潮，占该月总数百分之四十四；五月份因要求改善待遇而引起工潮，占该月总数百分之二十七；九月份因反压迫争自由而引起罢工、怠工，占该月总数百分之七。说明由于蒋介石卖国、独裁反人民统治，造成通货膨胀，物价剧涨，以及官僚资本的垄断统制，美货倾销，民族工商业危机加深，因而迫使工人为生存而斗争，这是引起广泛工潮的基本原因。今年二月蒋匪颁布“经济紧急措施方案”，向劳工进攻，冻结工资于一月份的水平上，实行饥饿政策；以及八月间的反动的“总动员令”，禁止罢工、怠工，妄图摧残工人的基本自由权利，更激起了广大工人为求生存争民主、争自由运动的高涨。\n    蒋家法西斯匪徒慑于工人的威胁，因而所采取的唯一手段只是毫无人性的镇压与摧残。上海九月间水电交通工人大罢工时期，被逮捕工人竟达百余人之多。蒋匪当局妄图控制全市工会，并悬赏十万元捉拿法商电车公司工人领袖欧阳仁，威胁将以青年军二○二师镇压，宣布拒绝复工者“就地枪决”。甚至公然枪杀济南胶济铁路局及武汉被服厂的工人。\n    工人们对蒋家法斯西匪徒暴行的回答则是有力的反击。上海工人在反“紧措方案”时期，曾给蒋匪市府公开信，要求解冻指数，并警告：“如果企图使用武力，将发生严重后果。”数千无线电职工则阻止了上海与国内外无线电交通，谴责蒋匪当局“三餐之不足，锐减了我们的效率与能力。”英商汽车公司二千多职工列队扛着英商工会的大旗，举行游行请愿，当蒋匪当局以五辆红色警备车及武装警察组成防线拦阻时，职工均怒吼“干呀！”“冲呀！”握紧了拳头，在蒋匪警察的刺刀和机枪瞄准下挺进，几千个拳头随时准备打向这些忘八蛋的头上。在工人雄壮声势下，蒋匪警察畏缩地退却了。济南胶济路局三千工人，七月间为反杀人统治怒打该局局长陈舜耕，迫使陈狼狈辞职。六月间的蒋匪青岛交通公司经理高威书，及十一月间该地蒋匪造船所主任均慑于工人声势，被迫向工人道歉及辞职或溜跑。\n    在蒋家法西斯匪徒们残酷压迫下，工人们表现了阶级兄弟更紧密的团结，上海工人反“紧措方案”的盛大声势，迫使蒋匪当局应允修改部分办法，工人们即着重揭穿并反对：“此项办法只限上海一地，各地职工依然无法生活。”上海法电工人鼓励因游行请愿遭蒋匪当局镇压的英电工人说：“你们和他们（指蒋家匪帮）干好了，我们会跟上来，全上海的工人会撑你们的腰。”当九月上海水电交通工人反压迫、争自由运动遭蒋匪当局血腥摧残时，法电工会发言人即宣布：“如果工会中任何一个人被捕，则全体工人同时要求入狱。”六月底青岛蒋匪交通公司四百名工人中被解雇一百六十名，被裁者反对，其余留用员工即以罢工援助。该市工会亦即发动全市七万工人募捐援助官僚资本之齐鲁公司工人的罢工。由于工人的这种英勇斗争和兄弟团结，使他们一再挫折了蒋匪的镇压与分化，使蒋家匪帮狼狈不堪。\n    蒋家匪帮对工人运动除了摧残镇压外，一贯技俩便是造谣诬蔑，给工人加上“扰乱社会秩序”、“妨碍交通”等等罪名，但事实是无情的讽刺了这一切。九月间美商水电公司职工罢工时，仍多方设法以电力供给用户，工人每次游行请愿及其他行动都是有组织有秩序地进行的。工人们所要破坏的，仅仅是迫使人民不能生活下去的蒋家匪帮的卖国独裁的秩序，工人们是为人民的民主秩序与幸福生活而斗争的。而蒋家法西斯匪徒们对工人行动总是多方捣乱与阻难，正是“扰乱社会秩序”，“破坏治安”。广大社会同情是属于工人方面的。\n    一年来蒋管区工人斗争虽然还是此起彼伏，是不平衡的，但是斗争的性质早已远远超过了经济斗争的范围。工人们从自己切身经验中已更清楚的认识了蒋家匪帮反人民杀人犯凶相，深刻体验到唯有结束这个统治才能求得生存、民主和自由。并日益自觉到自己肩上所担负的伟大历史任务，上海群众性工会组织曾于五月间发表宣言，敦促上海工人“为真正和平惩罚战争贩子（蒋介石及其伙伴），及建立民主而战”，并号召上海工人“反对征兵征粮滥发通货苛捐杂税，和借外债打内战。”蒋管区工人正在继续扩大斗争，并在斗争中锻炼与提高自己，团结全体劳动人民配合人民解放军的爱国解放战争的伟大反攻，为打倒蒋介石，建立新中国的远大目标而奋斗。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 3rd. The results of the Jinan People's Liberation Army's liberation of Yuncheng: a total of over 10,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits from the 369th Regiment, 150th Regiment, and 182nd Regiment of the 123rd Brigade of the 36th Division, Yan Xishan's Bandit Protection 5th Regiment, the 5th Special Office, and 16 puppet county governments were annihilated. Over 2,000 enemy soldiers including the 250th Regiment Commander An Zhizhong were killed, and over 8,100 enemy soldiers were captured, including the 182nd Regiment Commander Lei Wenqing, 250th Regiment Deputy Commander Hu Yulong, and 5th Special Commissioner Hou Pinhan. Preliminary statistics show the following was seized: 4 howitzers, 2 infantry guns, 2 heavy mortars, 43 mortars, 1 anti-tank gun, 1 rocket launcher, 32 60mm mortars, 45 heavy machine guns, 568 light machine guns, 1,700 rifles, 7 grenade launchers, 9 projectors, 1 flamethrower, 51 submachine guns, over 5,700 rounds of various artillery shells, 42 radio stations, 2 radiotelephones, 2 telephone exchanges, 224 telephones, 25 radios, and over 100 vehicles. One plane was shot down. Many other items were seized and are still being inventoried.\n\nTaiyue, this newspaper, 3rd. The spokesman of the Jinan People's Liberation Army Headquarters, after our army liberated Yuncheng and Anyi, made a statement saying: The Jinan battlefield, like other battlefields across the country, when our people launched a large-scale counteroffensive, the bandit Hu Zongnan showed the embarrassing situation of \"robbing Peter to pay Paul\" and being stretched thin. Every action on our Jinan battlefield is closely coordinated with the various battlefields across the country. Last September, when the Chen-Xie army conducted the Tongguan-Shaanxi campaign, the bandit Hu Zongnan hurriedly drew troops from Linfen and Yuncheng in southern Shanxi, but was held back by the People's Liberation Army, which occupied two airfields, so bandit Hu Zongnan was so anxious that he could not run away on land or fly away from the air. On September 8th, our army began to surround Yuncheng. During this period, when the Chen-Xie army was developing southward, bandit Hu Zongnan again drew troops from northern Shaanxi, attempting to open the Longhai Railway and save the demise of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, but Yuncheng was on the eve of our army's general offensive, which forced bandit Hu Zongnan to abandon his original plan. He immediately ordered the 36th Division Commander Zhong Song to bring four brigades to reinforce Yuncheng. Our army took the initiative to withdraw from the encirclement of Yuncheng and concentrated its main force to fight the reinforcements. Bandit Hu Zongnan paid the price of 3,700 people being annihilated, and only sent three companies of the 250th Regiment and the remnants of Lei Wenqing's 182nd Regiment to Yuncheng. The so-called bandit Hu Zongnan's reinforcements were beaten by us and fled to the south bank of the Yellow River. This kind of piecemeal reinforcement did not save the crisis of the Yuncheng enemy being annihilated. On the contrary, he sent us a lot of personnel, weapons, and ammunition. At this point, our army rested for a while, and on December 17th continued to besiege Yuncheng. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, all obstacles to the city were cleared. This campaign coincided with the Liu-Deng, Chen-Su, and Chen-Xie armies' great destruction of the Pinghan and Longhai Railways. Bandit Hu Zongnan was forced to rush eight brigades, which were pieced together to reinforce the Longhai Railway, to Shanzhou on December 27th, lingering along the Yellow River. That night, we launched a general offensive against the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Yuncheng. After a night of fierce fighting, Yuncheng was liberated. The remnant bandits who broke through and fled were also completely annihilated by us. Bandit Hu Zongnan's reinforcements became defeated soldiers and finally suffered a setback. Then the spokesman pointed out: The entire process of the Yuncheng campaign is a picture of bandit Hu Zongnan's panic in the face of the People's Liberation Army's large-scale counteroffensive. Comparing us with the enemy, this issue is very meaningful. We are proactive everywhere, coordinating the counteroffensive against the enemy from the interior and exterior lines, and annihilating the enemy, but the enemy is passive everywhere, being beaten and annihilated from both the interior and exterior lines. In the middle, he even pieced together a so-called \"mobile unit,\" which, under our command, bumped into the south and suffered setbacks in the north. However, bandit Hu Zongnan is always reluctant to automatically abandon this isolated strategic stronghold completely surrounded by the liberated area's military and civilians. This is the conservatism of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, which is reflected in the strategic guidance that the Chiang-Hu bandit gang still wants to rely on the so-called \"modernized defensive fortifications\" to hold on to isolated strongholds. But repeated facts have proved that in front of the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Communist Party, there is no invincible fortress. The Chiang-Hu bandit gang also mistakenly believed that our army had launched a large-scale attack on the outer lines, and the inner lines were no longer able to counterattack. Isn't this another mistake? Facts have proved that our interior forces are still strong, not only holding the enemy and preventing him from leaving, but also annihilating him here. If the Hu Zongnan bandit officers and soldiers do not want to be annihilated, they can only lay down their weapons. No matter what methods Chiang-Hu Zongnan wants to rely on, such as fortifications, firepower, reinforcements, and conscription, they cannot save his incurable disease of insufficient military strength and low morale. In short, the Jinan battlefield is a microcosm of the national battlefield, the same showing that the enemy is getting weaker and smaller as he fights, until he is completely annihilated. Our army is getting stronger and larger as it fights, and will eventually win complete victory. The spokesman talked about the significance of our army's liberation of Yuncheng and Anyi: In military terms, it further enhances our army's mobile strength. To the south, it can control the Longhai Railway, and to the west, it can go out to Guanzhong. With a consolidated southern Shanxi, it can better support the Henan-Shaanxi operations. Politically, it destroyed the old nest of the reactionary forces in southern Shanxi. Yan Xishan's three special offices, sixteen exiled county governments, and thousands of evil landlords, the targets of struggle, were all swept away, removing a large stone slab from the people of southern Shanxi, blocking a large \"air-raid shelter,\" which will greatly promote the ongoing land reform movement. Economically, it controls the Lucun Salt Pond, which can supply salt to most areas of Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces, adding huge wealth to the liberated areas. This campaign is also a huge exercise and test for our troops. The Yuncheng campaign shows that our army can not only fight mobile warfare, but also fight offensive warfare and positional warfare. Whether it is earthwork operations, defending positions, or combined infantry, artillery, and engineering operations, we have gained many valuable experiences, which will lay the foundation for us to fight more and greater victories in the future. Speaking here, the spokesman recalled the past with a very optimistic tone: \"At this time last year, the Chiang-Hu bandit gang still wanted to seize Shanxi and ride on the heads of the people of Shanxi, looking for his happiness, so he moved his family and so on here, but today the Chiang-Hu bandits trapped in Yuncheng are exactly going the wrong way, and just found their graves in Yuncheng.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 运城战役歼敌万余　证明我内线兵力雄厚足可拔除一切孤立据点\n\n1948-01-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　运城战役歼敌万余\n    证明我内线兵力雄厚足可拔除一切孤立据点\n    【新华社晋冀鲁豫三日电】晋南解放军解放运城战果：计歼灭蒋匪三六师一二三旅之三六九团、一五○团、一八二团，阎匪保五团，第五专署及十六个伪县府共万余名。击毙二五○团团长安知中以下两千余名，俘一八二团团长雷文清、二五○团副团长胡玉龙、五专员侯频翰以下八千一百余名。据初步统计：缴获榴弹炮四门、步兵炮二门、重迫击炮二门、迫击炮四三门、战防炮一门、火箭筒一个，六○小炮三二门、重机枪四十五挺、轻机枪五六八挺、步枪一千七百支，掷弹筒七个，投掷器九个，火焰喷射器一个，冲锋式五十一支，各种炮弹五千七百余发，电台四二部，报话机二部，电话总机二部，电话机二二四部，收音机二五付，汽车百余辆。击落飞机一架。其他缴获甚多，继续清查中。\n    【本报太岳三日电】晋南人民解放军司令部发言人，对我军解放运城、安邑后发表谈话称：晋南战场和全国其他战场一样，当我人民大举反攻之际，胡匪即表现了挖肉补疮、捉襟见肘的窘态，而我晋南战场的每一行动，又和全国各个战场起着密切的配合作用。去年九月间，陈谢大军进行潼陕战役的时候，胡匪手忙脚乱的自晋南临汾、运城抽兵，但被人民解放军拉住了，占领了两处飞机场，急的胡匪从陆地跑不了，从空中也飞不走。九月八号，我军开始包围运城，这个期间，正是陈谢大军向南发展的时候，胡匪又从陕北抽兵，企图打通陇海路，拯救蒋家匪帮的覆灭，但是运城正在我军总攻前夜，又迫使胡匪放弃原订计划，即令三十六师师长钟松带着四个旅来增援运城，我军便主动撤围运城，集中主力打援，胡匪付出了三千七百人被歼灭的代价，仅把二五○团三个连及一八二团雷文清残部送到了运城。所谓胡匪援军便被我打的溃窜黄河南岸，此种拆东墙补西墙的增援，丝毫没有挽救了运城敌人被歼灭的危机，相反的他又给我们送来了不少的人员、武器、弹药。至此，我军稍事休整，于十二月十七日继续围攻运城，经三昼夜的激烈战斗，便全部扫清登城障碍。这次战役正配合了刘邓、陈粟、陈谢三路大军大破平汉路陇海路，胡匪又被迫把拼凑用来增援陇海路的八个旅，星夜兼程，于十二月二十七日赶到陕州、徘徊于黄河沿岸之际，我即在当晚，对运城蒋匪发动总攻，经一夜激烈战斗，运城即告解放，突围逃窜的残匪，亦被我全部歼灭，胡匪援兵倒成了溃兵，最后还是碰了一鼻子灰。接着发言人又指出：运城战役的全部过程，正是胡匪在人民解放军大举反攻面前表现手忙脚乱的一幅图画。把我们和敌人对比的看，这个问题非常有意味，我们处处表现主动，从内外线配合着反攻敌人，歼灭敌人，敌人却处处表现被动，内外线都是挨打被歼灭，并且中间还拼凑一股所谓“机动部队”，在我们的指挥下，南撞一头、北碰一鼻子的两头挨打。但是，胡匪总舍不得自动放弃这个完全被解放区军民包围着的孤立战略据点，这是大地主大资产阶级的保守性，在战略指导上，反映出蒋胡匪帮还要想凭借所谓“现代化防御筑城”，固守孤立据点，但历次事实证明，在共产党领导下的中国人民解放军面前，并没有攻不破的堡垒。蒋胡匪帮他还误认为我大军打到外线，内线已无力反攻，这不又错了吗？事实证明，我们内线兵力仍然雄厚，不但拉住敌人不让他走，并且要把他消灭在这里，胡匪官兵要想不被歼灭，只有放下武器，不管蒋胡匪想依靠工事火力、增援、抓丁等一切办法，都挽救不了他的兵力不足，士气低落的不治之症。总之，晋南战场正是全国战场的一个缩影，同样的表现出敌人是越打越弱越小，到最后完全被歼灭。我军是越战越强越大，最后完全胜利。发言人谈到我军解放运城安邑的意义时说：在军事上更增强了我军的机动力量，向南可控制陇海路，向西可出关中，并以巩固的晋南，更好的支援豫陕作战。在政治上摧毁了晋南反动势力的老巢，阎匪的三个专著、十六个流亡县政府以及数千恶霸地主斗争对象，被一网打尽，给晋南人民身上搬掉一块大石板，堵塞住一个大“防空洞”，将使正在发展着的土地改革运动，大大推进一步。在经济上，控制了可供晋、豫、陕三省大部地区食盐的潞村盐池，给解放区增加了巨大的财富。这次战役，对我们部队说来，也是一个巨大的锻炼与考验。运城战役说明了我军不但会打运动战，并且会打攻坚战和阵地战，不论土工作业，守阵地和步、炮、工合同动作，都赢得了许多宝贵经验，将奠定我们今后再打更多更大胜仗的基础。谈到这里，发言人以非常乐观的口吻回忆过去说：“去年的现在，蒋胡匪还是想来霸占山西，骑在山西人民头上，寻找他的幸福，所以将家眷等等都搬来了，但是今天困守运城的蒋胡匪，不正是走错了路，而且正好在运城找到了他们的坟墓。”"

After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, he feared that business would be difficult and intended to sell his printing machines (eight-page letterpress machine, etc.) and materials. Coincidentally, a purchasing agent from Jinnan Daily went to buy them, setting the price at 42 million yuan (the actual price should be 6 million yuan). A contract was drawn up, and 300,000 yuan of border currency was paid as a deposit. Due to martial law, the machines were not transported. Later, the Materials Management Committee found out about this and asked him why he was selling them so cheaply. He said: 'Firstly, I wanted to sell at the time, and secondly, people in military uniforms carrying guns came twice, and I was afraid not to sell. The deal was final, and besides, I had already signed a contract with them, so what could I say?' In order to protect urban industry and commerce from damage, the Management Committee told him to disregard the contract and return the money to Jinnan Daily and not sell the machines.\" Upon seeing this news, the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Region immediately notified propaganda organs in all districts to conduct a serious investigation based on this news to see if there were similar cases of seizing opportunities in newly liberated cities, only caring about oneself, disregarding the masses, and harming the people and the interests of industry and commerce.

Reports from various sources indicate that the planned economies of the new democratic countries in Southeast Europe have achieved considerable success. In Poland, despite the tremendous damage from the war, overall industrial production has reached pre-war levels, with the heavy industry sector exceeding them. Coal miners completed their annual plan ahead of schedule on December 20th, exporting 17 million tons of coal by December 15th. Tractor manufacturing has been established. Production of agricultural machinery and fertilizers exceeds pre-war levels. This year's train freight volume also exceeds pre-war levels. In the western territories alone, there are 1,215 state-owned factories, accounting for 30 percent of the national total, employing 304,000 workers.\n\nIn Yugoslavia, production in all industrial sectors this year has exceeded pre-war levels, with production increasing by 58 percent in one year. Investment in the first half of this year was more than double that of the first half of last year. Two hundred large industrial enterprises have begun construction. The largest iron factory near Ljubljana recently began operations. There was a bumper harvest of wheat and corn. American and British reactionaries attempted to create a budget deficit in Yugoslavia by stopping UNRRA aid, but in the first half of this year, Yugoslavia's budget had a surplus of 6 billion dinars in revenue over expenditure.\n\nIn Bulgaria, industrial production has also exceeded last year. Industries such as rubber, textiles, paper, and coal mining have increased by more than 28 percent. In the first five months of this year, 49 percent of the annual electrification plan and large industrial construction was completed. The number of industrial workers reached over 166,000, breaking historical records. Foreign trade increased by 88 percent compared to last year.\n\nIn Czechoslovakia, the parliament unanimously passed the 1948 budget on the 19th. The new budget reflects the further growth of the Czech economy. The new budget's revenue is 56.9 billion Czech crowns (44.7 billion in 1947), and expenditure is 68.95 billion Czech crowns. Education expenditure accounts for 10.5 percent of the budget (compared to only 5.5 percent before the war). The largest portion of the budget will be used to develop various sectors of the national economy, and defense expenditure has been reduced by 1.3 billion compared to this year.\n\nIn Romania, youth volunteer teams built a large gas pipeline, 753 kilometers long, in 40 days. Gas delivery began before December 10th, supplying industrial areas in Bucharest, Prahova, and Brasov. In addition, the Dej-Sarval railway, connecting Outer Transylvania with the Romanian mainland, was fully repaired and opened to traffic on the 9th.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 31st. Sofia News: The Bulgarian National Assembly passed at its third reading on the 25th the Law on Nationalization of Industry, Mines and Banks. The law stipulates that all private enterprises, except cooperatives, workshops and printing factories belonging to public organizations, must be nationalized. Private business owners who can prove their loyalty to the country may be compensated for their losses with public bonds. When the law was passed, all members of parliament and thousands of people outside the venue cheered in unison. After hearing the decision, workers in factories across the country also held meetings, unanimously supporting the government's confiscation of factories and enterprises from capitalists and exploiters; and guaranteed to fully improve product quality and further launch labor competitions.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-06",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "(Report from our newspaper in Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 1st) A correspondent from our branch office commented on the military struggle situation in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area over the past year, stating: Over the past year, local regiments, county brigades, and militia protect-the-fields teams in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, with their heroic and tenacious posture, persisted in their positions amidst the enemy's and our army's seesaw guerrilla warfare, crushed Chiang Kai-shek's \"encirclement and suppression,\" coordinated with the main force's operations, assisted the masses in land reform, and strengthened their own armed forces. The military struggle situation in Hebei-Shandong-Henan over the past year can be divided into four stages:\n\nFrom January to March, the enemy's offensive arrogance could still reach north of the Yellow River, occupying Puyang, Hua County, Qingfeng, Nanle, and Pu County, Guan County, Fan County, and other places, and carrying out frenzied \"encirclement and suppression\" in county towns and townships south of the Yellow River. However, our local armed forces were still able to adopt the tactics of \"the enemy advances, we advance; turning to the enemy's rear\" to persist in the struggle in the rural hinterland, containing the enemy's forces, putting the enemy's seven divisions into the predicament of defending cities and highway transportation lines, and reducing the burden on our main force's operations. In early February, Liu Deng's army captured Juye, Jiaxiang, Dingtao, and Cao County, annihilating more than 10,000 enemies, and launched an attack on the Longhai Railway, drawing the enemy back. During this period, the enemy launched more than 20 consecutive \"encirclement and suppression\" operations involving more than 1,000 people, but our local armed forces tenaciously persisted in this struggle, laying the foundation for independent and sustained struggle.\n\nFrom March to the end of June, a period of four months, was a period of independent persistence for our local armed forces. In early March, our main force crossed the Yellow River northward and moved west to northern Henan. At this time, the enemy's eight divisions were distributed in counties, townships, and along transportation lines south of the Yellow River, attempting to extinguish our thriving guerrilla warfare south of the Yellow River, and using local \"homecoming legions\" to guard the Yellow River, replacing his 400,000 troops. Therefore, the war in Henan was unprecedentedly frequent. Especially in the Huxi and southwestern Shandong sub-districts, at this moment, the local regiments launched external attacks to subdue the enemy behind enemy lines, while the inland militia, with one hand holding a gun and the other distributing land, launched tunnel warfare. The tunnels in the 3rd and 5th sub-districts were as dense as spider webs, and Chiang Kai-shek's main force and local diehards were in awe and dared not take a step forward. The people of the four sub-districts of Henan, under the principle of \"one hand holding a gun and the other distributing land,\" mostly received land and armed themselves, preparing for our main force's southward counter-offensive.\n\nFrom July to October was the third stage. In early July, Liu Deng's counter-offensive army crossed the natural barrier of the Yellow River, continuously annihilating nine and a half enemy brigades, and then crossed the Longhai Railway southward. The situation in Henan returned to a situation of seesaw warfare between the enemy and our forces. In the most tense 50 days, there was an average of one seesaw battle every five days. During this period, our local armed forces actively coordinated with the main force's operations, achieving a victory of annihilating 3,000 enemies. Our vast countryside completed the task of supporting the field army.\n\nAfter October, the situation in Hebei-Shandong-Henan greatly changed, and the focus of the war shifted to the Longhai Railway and its southern areas. Our local armed forces then turned to actively attacking the enemy, and the enemy was in a defensive and passive position. The few remaining enemies scattered in Henan, such as the 73rd Division, 84th Brigade, 70th Division, 20th Division, 68th Division, 55th Division, and 41st Brigade, were also often trapped in strongholds and dared not easily commit crimes. Last month, the local armed forces of the Huxi sub-district captured the major stronghold of Zhao Zhuangji, and the local armed forces of the 1st sub-district entered Shiheng Town. This month, our local regiments launched attacks in two directions, east and west.

In 1947, the military region's troops fought many beautiful battles, eliminating more than 30,000 enemies, and also fought many model battles, receiving commendations from higher authorities. The circular stated: \"In 1947, the military region's troops independently organized several relatively large battles, especially the recovery of Yicheng in January and the annihilation of a regiment of Chiang bandit regular troops at Pinglu Temple in July. These were model battles in which local corps were completely concentrated to fight and thoroughly annihilate the enemy. The guerrilla forces in various places either cooperated with the main forces in combat or independently persisted in the struggle against the enemy in their own localities. Most of them took the initiative to actively attack the enemy. Among the guerrilla forces, the Jiexiu Brigade (especially the Third District Detachment), the Linfen Brigade, the Yilin Brigade, and the Anyi and Mengxian Independent Battalions fought the most and the best. They fought flexibly, achieved great results, and had good relations with the masses, which are worthy of everyone's learning.

On the evening of the 26th, before the final general offensive to encircle and annihilate the 3rd Division, our troops heavily surrounded the regiment in an area 30 li southwest of Zaoziya Village. After a brief engagement, our commanders and soldiers began shouting to the regiment. The soldiers of the regiment stopped firing one after another. Tian, the political commissar of one of our regiments, issued a warning to the officers and soldiers of the regiment at 5:10 PM, ordering them to voluntarily lay down their arms before 6:00 PM. Those who violated the order would be annihilated, and those who complied with the order would receive preferential treatment. At 5:30 PM, Chen Dehua sent his Major Regimental Adjutant Zhu Jinxin to contact the Liberation Army, bringing with him a letter in his own handwriting stating: They would come with their troops at 6:00 PM and requesting a designated location. From 6:10 PM to 6:30 PM, Regiment Commander Chen, together with Lieutenant Colonel Deputy Regiment Commander Zhou Jianzhong, Major Battalion Commander of the 1st Battalion Chen Yili, and others, personally led 764 officers and soldiers to lay down their arms in order. They surrendered seven mortars, 59 various machine guns, and other weapons and ammunition. Our troops then escorted them safely to the liberated area.

Its 3rd Battalion Commander had been wounded by our forces, the 7th Company was annihilated in Luohe on the 19th, and the 9th Company was annihilated in Luozhuang on the 25th.

When the People's Liberation Army advanced to Hanzhuang, 40 li west of Kaifeng, the masses spontaneously settled accounts with a local tyrant landlord surnamed Han, recovering 20,000 jin of grain and more than 10,000 jin of peanuts. The poor people distributed the grain and discussed organizing a \"Poor People's Association.\" As soon as Zhuxian Town was liberated, the masses in the town overthrew Yang Tingchen, the town's first Bao chief, a murderer for the enemy, puppet regime, and the KMT, and a local tyrant who had been drinking the blood of the people for more than a decade. After a public trial, he was sentenced to death. Amidst the rumble of artillery surrounding the four passes of Xuchang, poor peasants and farmhands in Tongzhuang, a dozen li east of Xuchang, joined forces to distribute the grain and wealth of several local tyrant landlords, including one surnamed Liang. After Changge was liberated, the masses in the city distributed the grain of eight local tyrant landlords, including Chen Xiufeng, a member of the KMT Henan Provincial Council. When the People's Liberation Army was stationed in Sangshumiao, eight li southeast of Weichuan, the masses distributed 5,000 jin of grain and all the wealth of Li Ruisheng, the KMT secretary and local tyrant landlord. The Changge County Relief Home was controlled by landlords, and all the orphans were underfed and poorly clothed.

The officers and soldiers distributing grain were unable to sleep for several days and nights in order to distribute grain to the masses.

This once-famous country of large landowners has now taken on a new look, and the oppressed and exploited poor peasants have completely turned over and become the masters of the land.\n　　This book uses a large amount of space to write about the land reform situation in Poland. These facts were personally witnessed by the famous journalist Anna Louise Strong. She personally watched how Polish peasants established peasant committees; she personally watched how Polish peasants divided classes; how they evenly distributed land.\n　　Today, as we are carrying out land reform, this is an extremely valuable reference book. The entire book is more than 100,000 words, and has been translated by Comrade Li Dihua, and proofread by many people. The translation is smooth and easy to understand, and this is the first publication by our bookstore.\n　　This book also truthfully narrates the heroic struggle of the Polish people to eliminate Hitler, and how the Polish government-in-exile, under the instigation of the United States and Britain, plunged millions of people in Warsaw into tragic death.

He was found guilty of stealing the fruits of the masses' struggle, stabbing the masses who captured him, sabotaging land reform, and violating the discipline of the People's Liberation Army. He has been sentenced to death by the army. On December 4th, Wang Minghuan visited the exhibition of the fruits of the masses' struggle in the village where he was stationed (Xiading Village, Wenxi County) and stole a glass, which contained a small Buddha statue and other items. The masses saw him and asked him to return it. Not only did he not admit his mistake and return the items, but he also cursed: \"Without us fighting at the front, how could you have turned yourselves over?\" \"The stuff belonged to the landlord; none of it is yours!\" When the civil affairs cadre found out, he forced him to return the items to the village. Wang Minghuan harbored resentment from then on and wanted to retaliate. He even incited individual soldiers, preparing to kill the militiamen. The militiamen were very afraid and reported to the militia company commander. The militia company commander saw that the matter was serious and went to detain Wang Minghuan, preparing to hand him over to the higher authorities for processing. Wang Minghuan saw the militiamen coming to detain him, and while cursing, he snatched the militiamen's gun and slapped them several times, tying up the militiamen. Many militiamen and masses waiting outside for news saw that the people who went in had not come out for a long time, fearing something had happened, and squeezed inside to see. Wang Minghuan picked up a bayonet and stabbed an old man in the stomach, creating a two-inch-long wound. The masses quickly found the district chief, and Wang Minghuan punched the district chief several times. After this incident, the leaders of the unit believed that Wang Minghuan, as a cadre, casually stole the fruits of the masses' struggle, stabbed the masses who captured him, beat the district chief of the democratic government, sabotaged land reform, and violated the discipline of the People's Liberation Army. His crime was very serious and could not be forgiven. Therefore, on December 7th, a public trial was held, he was expelled from the military, and handed over to military law for processing. The army accepted the opinions of the masses, and according to army rules, sentenced Wang Minghuan to death. Wang Gengchen, a soldier who had been deceived by him, confessed his mistakes on the spot and was given a lenient sentence.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 排长王明焕破坏土地改革　军民公审宣布死刑\n\n1948-01-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　排长王明焕破坏土地改革\n  　军民公审宣布死刑\n    【本报太岳二日电】去年十二月七日，晋南人民解放军×部和驻地群众一起公审×团二连排长王明焕，他犯了偷拿群众斗争果实，刺伤捕捉他的群众，破坏土地改革，破坏人民解放军纪律的大罪过，已被军队判处死刑。十二月四日，王明焕参观驻村（闻喜下丁村）群众的斗争果实展览大会，偷了一个玻璃杯，杯中放着小佛像等物。群众看见，让他交回。他不但不认错交还，反倒破口大骂：“没有老子在前方打仗，你们还能翻身？”“东西是老财的，那个是你们的？”民运干事知道了，强迫他把东西还给村里。王明焕从此怀恨在心，想要报复，还鼓动了个别战士，准备杀害民兵。民兵很害怕，报告了民兵连长。民兵连长看着事情严重，就去扣王明焕；准备交给上级处理。王明焕看见扣他的民兵来了，一边骂，一边夺了民兵的枪，还打了几个耳光，把民兵绑起来。在门外等着听信的很多民兵和群众看见进去的人好久不出来，怕出了事，挤到里面去看，王明焕拿起刺刀，把一个老汉的肚子刺破二寸长的口子。群众赶忙把区长找来，王明焕又把区长打了几拳。这件事情发生后，部队领导上认为王明焕当的是干部、随便偷拿群众斗争果实，刺伤捕捉他的群众，殴打民主政府的区长，破坏土地改革，破坏人民解放军的纪律，罪过很大，不能饶他，就在十二月七日召开公审大会，开除了他的军籍，交军法处理。军队接受了群众的意见，按照军队的规矩，判决王明焕死刑。受他欺骗的战士王庚辰当场坦白认错，从轻处理。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-06",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Comrades! The conference has been going on for two or three months, and it has been very successful. Comrade Yi Bo's summary report clearly indicated our direction, tasks, and methods to complete the tasks. Comrade Xu Xiangqian also spoke very clearly to us about the tasks at the current stage. The central government's policy is clear, and after such a long period of study, research, reflection, and self-criticism, everyone should be clear about it. The current problem is how to resolutely and thoroughly implement it after you go back. Comrade Yi Bo put it well, this is a historical task, the most central task for the whole party at present. If we do it well, we can overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and win the victory of the revolution. The peasants' liberation will also be completely victorious. If we don't do it well, the party and the country will perish, and we will lose our heads. I hope comrades will work hard after returning, and encourage each other with Comrade Yi Bo's report and Comrade Xu Xiangqian's speech. Comrade Yi Bo said everything about the whole issue in the summary. All our party comrades should act according to the summary. This summary is the method that everyone has researched. Here, I will say a few words about the army.\n\nFirst of all, what I want to say is that the army should, without exception, resolutely and thoroughly implement the task of completely and equally distributing land and rectifying the party. According to the review of this conference, our army has two very wrong ideas: the first is to separate fighting from land reform; thinking that the army is in charge of fighting, and land reform is the business of party affairs workers and mass workers. Therefore, in the entire land reform, the army did not take on the responsibilities it should have. The vast majority adopted an attitude of standing by and being indifferent, and very few directly participated in helping. There were even many people who opposed land reform and did many anti-people and counter-revolutionary things. This is the most obvious manifestation of the army not serving the people. From now on, the army must actively participate in helping, supporting, and defending the peasant emancipation movement, and is not allowed to adopt an attitude of standing by. First of all, we must be clear in our minds that we are the sons and daughters of workers and peasants, and the peasant revolutionary army. Fighting Lao Jiang in the front and fighting the landlord class in the rear is one task, and both are fighting for the emancipation of the peasants. If we encounter landlords resisting the peasants or sabotaging the peasants' actions, the army should, without shirking its responsibility, suppress them. If we ignore them or turn a blind eye, it is an act of betraying the people and surrendering to the landlords. If we turn around and interfere with the peasant emancipation movement to support the landlords, it is a heinous counter-revolutionary act and must be severely punished by discipline. The second wrong idea is that the party in the army is thought to be purer than the local party, so the issue of party rectification in the army is not taken very seriously. This idea was relatively common in the period before the conference, and it cannot be said that it has completely disappeared now. In fact, the impurity of the party in the army is more serious than the local party in some places. Everyone has reviewed a lot, so I won't say it here. However, there is no doubt that the harm to the people from the impurity of the party in the army will be much more serious, because the army has weapons in its hands. If it serves the landlords, it will not only tip them off, secretly instigate them, and undermine the peasants' solidarity and struggle, but it will also armed suppress the peasants, creating a very serious situation. In Jinnan, a staff officer who had been a company commander hid many landlords and guns at home in preparation for an uprising. If he was still a company commander and led a company to revolt, you can see how serious the situation would be! Therefore, even if the impurity of the army is not more serious than the local party, its serious harm cannot be equated with the local party. We must be extremely vigilant. This is not a small matter, especially for comrades who work in the army, we must clearly recognize this point, otherwise we will make serious mistakes. Anyone who ignores this point and relaxes the party rectification in the army, and therefore makes serious mistakes, will be severely punished by party discipline.\n\nSo, how should the party in the army be rectified? The political department has convened responsible comrades from various military regions several times to exchange opinions. I have already mentioned some opinions in my last report. The Central Bureau will also issue special instructions. Here, I will only focus on two points:\n\nFirst, we must rectify warlordism. The main difference and the most basic difference between the warlord army and the people's army is: on the one hand, it defends the interests of the landlord and bourgeoisie, and oppresses, exploits, and enslaves the people for the landlord and bourgeoisie; on the other hand, it defends the interests of the people and serves the people. However, whether it is a warlord army or a people's army, its vast majority of soldiers come from workers and peasants, and they organize, arm, and train the people. In order for the warlord army to make soldiers who originally came from the people oppress, exploit, and enslave the people for the landlord and bourgeoisie, it has to separate the soldiers from the people, make them forget their origins, detach themselves from the people everywhere, and oppose the people. This forms a set of warlord system, using all kinds of deceptive methods to specially educate and train soldiers, turning them into tools for warlords to get promoted and make a fortune, blindly serving the landlord and bourgeoisie, and doing evil on the heads of the people. The people's army must always make them know that they are the sons and daughters of the people, and should always unite with the people and be loyal and filial to the people. According to this standard, let's examine our army. How many truly conform to the essence of the people's army and are fully worthy of being called the people's army? From this conference, we can also see how our army is detached from the masses, how it bullies the people, oppresses the people, and has done many anti-people things. These are the manifestations of warlordism. Since the Anti-Japanese War, because North China was opened up after the Eighth Route Army came, and various political powers and mass organizations were established, some comrades in the army developed a wrong idea, thinking that the world was won by the army, and the people were liberated by the army. They just forgot that the army was originally organized by the people, and the people organized this army for their own liberation. Therefore, they believed that the army had merit and should be superior to others, doing whatever they wanted on the heads of the masses, demanding that the masses reward them for their merits and support them everywhere. As a result, all kinds of anti-people things such as beating and scolding the masses, coercing the masses, and harming the interests of the masses occurred. The attitude of some troops towards the people is even exactly the same as that of the warlord army. This is forgetting one's roots, this is disloyal and unfilial to the people, this is turning from the sons and daughters of the people into traitors and rebels of the people. Traitors and rebels, everyone has the right to punish them. From now on, everyone should stand up to interfere and oppose any anti-people things in the army. Whoever uses arms against the people is like turning the guns around on the front line to shoot at their own troops, and must be treated as a counter-revolutionary crime. If cadres lead soldiers to do anti-people things, the soldiers should not only not accept this counter-revolutionary order, but should also arrest these cadres and hand them over to the people's court. As long as the soldiers' awareness is raised, those anti-people orders that do evil will definitely not be able to be implemented, and will definitely be severely打击.\n\nSecond, we must rectify sectarianism in the army. The main manifestation is that the army makes independence from the people and the party, and becomes a hornet's nest that no one can provoke. Whenever problems occur between the army and the people, the army always speaks from the army's side without considering any conditions, as if it were an army gang opposed to the people. This sectarianism is inseparable from warlordism. The main ideological source is the wrong idea that the army has merit and should stand on the heads of the people. Some cadres are even exactly the same as warlords, regarding the army as their own private property, and no one else can provoke them. This is particularly evident in land reform; whenever a military family member is struggled against, the army always demands care without any class stand or principles, or directly shields and covers up. This sectarianism is extremely blind, so it is taken advantage of by landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements. Obviously they are targets of the people's enemy struggle, and once they get into the army, the army treats them as their own and shields and covers them up. These people are clearly using the army to oppress the people, and our army blindly supports them, thinking that they are taking care of cadres and soldiers. For example, the beating of district and village cadres by the Tangyin Brigade and the Sixth Column's return-to-unit battalion was caused by the instigation of one or two bad elements. This sectarianism that makes independence from the people, whether it is blind or not, is essentially anti-people. As a result, the army will become a large anti-people group. Our army is the people's army, and should serve the people wholeheartedly and well. It is not allowed to make independence from the people and become a faction of its own. All views and handling of problems must be based on the interests and opinions of the people. The people are the army's biological parents and adoptive parents. Even if there is merit, it should be attributed to the people. From now on, when problems occur between the army and the people, we must never simply treat it as a relationship between the army and the people. We must also use the class stand, viewpoint, and method to analyze it and see whether it is anti-people or an internal dispute; even if it is an internal dispute, we must clearly point out that this is a manifestation of the army not serving the people well and not fulfilling its responsibility as a loyal and filial son of the people, and should also be criticized and blamed.\n\nIn short, serving the people is the essence of the people's army. Without this, it cannot be said to be the people's army. From now on, we must use this standard to check. Moreover, serving the people is not abstract, it should be concrete. It is not only reflected in combat and land reform, but also in all aspects of life and action. The Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention are a concrete standard, which can be used for us to check our own troops, how much they have served the people, and whether they are worthy of being called the people's army. If they are not worthy of being called the people's army, the comrades who lead the troops at all levels must reflect on what they have done for the people? Have they eaten millet rice for nothing and not taken responsibility for the people? Is there a problem with their own position? There can be no ambiguity about this.\n\nChairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu put forward the three major principles of army building in the report on the coalition government and the report on the liberated areas battlefield in the Seventh National Congress, that is, the three major guidelines for army building. We must use this to check, rectify, and eliminate the serious and widespread sectarianism and warlordism that make independence from the party and the people in the People's Liberation Army.\n\nThe conference has been going on for a long time and there has been a lot of discussion. I fully agree with Comrade Yi Bo's summary. I believe that our region will make a big step forward. The whole party rectifies the party and the army at the same time in the land reform. This is another big test for us in the twenty-six years of army building. History will continue to test us, and we should be able to withstand the test.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 肃清军阀主义宗派主义　严整军队党的队伍  中央局土地会议闭幕会上滕副司令员讲话\n\n1948-01-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　肃清军阀主义宗派主义\n  　严整军队党的队伍\n    中央局土地会议闭幕会上滕副司令员讲话\n    同志们！大会开了两三个月，很成功。一波同志的总结报告指示我们的方针、任务，及完成任务的办法，都很明确，很清楚。徐向前同志向我们谈的对现阶段的任务，也讲得很清楚了。中央的方针是明确的，经过了这样长时间的学习、研究、反省、检讨，大家也应该是明确的了。现在的问题，是大家回去后，如何坚决彻底执行的问题。一波同志说的好，这是一个历史的任务，是全党目前一个最中心的任务，作得好就可以打倒蒋介石，取得革命的胜利，农民的翻身也会彻底得到胜利，作不好就要亡党亡国亡头。希望同志们回去好好的工作，以一波同志的报告，徐向前同志的讲话，共同勉励。整个问题，一波同志在总结中都说了，我们全党的同志，就照总结办事，这个总结是大家研究出来的办法。这里我就军队方面说几句话。\n    首先，我要说的，就是军队在这次彻底平分土地与整党的任务中，应该毫无例外地同样坚决彻底执行，根据这次大会的检讨，我们军队有两个非常错误的思想：第一个就是把打仗与土地改革分开；认为军队是管打仗的，土地改革是党务工作群众工作者的事情，所以在整个土地改革中军队未担负起应负的任务，绝大多数是采取袖手旁观，漠不关心的态度，直接参加帮助的很少，甚至还有不少的人反对土地改革，作了许多反人民反革命的事情，这是军队没有为人民服务最明显的表现。今后军队一律要积极参加帮助、拥护、保卫农民翻身运动，不准采取袖手旁观的态度。首先在思想上要明确自己是工农的子弟，是农民革命军，在前方打老蒋与在后方打地主阶级是一个任务，都是为农民翻身而战。如果遇到地主反抗农民，破坏农民的行动，军队应该责无旁贷加以镇压，如果置之不理或熟视无睹，就是背叛人民投降地主的行动；如果还要反过来干涉农民的翻身运动为地主撑腰，那就是罪大恶极的反革命行为，一定要受到严厉的纪律制裁。第二个错误的思想，就是以为军队的党要比地方的党纯洁，因而对军队整党的问题看得不十分严重。这种思想在大会前一个时期是比较普遍的，现在还不能说是就完全没有了。事实上，军队党的不纯，在某些地方是比地方党还严重的，大家都检讨出来了很多，这里不再说。但军队党的不纯，其对人民的危害将更严重得多，这是毫无问题的，因为军队手里拿有武器，他如果给地主服务，就不仅是通风报信，暗中挑拨，破坏农民的团结斗争等等而已，并且会武装镇压农民，造成非常严重的形势；冀南有一个当过连长的参谋，曾在家里隐藏许多地主和枪支准备暴动，要是他还在当连长带着一连人暴动起来，你们看应该是多么严重的情况！所以即使军队的不纯，并不比地方党还严重，但他的危害之严重是不能与地方等量齐观的，我们一定要万分的警惕。这不是什么小题大做，特别是作军队工作的同志，要明确认识这一点，不然是要犯严重错误的。谁要是忽视了这点，放松了军队的整党，因而犯了严重的错误，一定要受到党的纪律的制裁。\n    那么，军队党到底应该怎样整呢？政治部已经召集各军区负责同志交换了几次意见，我在上次报告中已经大概提了几点意见，中央局还要专门发出指示，这里我只着重讲两点：\n    第一、是要整军阀主义。军阀军队与人民军队主要的区别也是最基本的区别，就是：一方面是保卫地主资产阶级的利益，为地主资产阶级压迫人民、剥削人民、奴役人民的；另一方面是保卫人民的利益，为人民服务的。但是不管是军阀军队或人民军队，他的广大士兵都是来自工农，都是把人民组织、武装、训练起来的。军阀军队为了要使本来出身于人民的兵士去为地主资产阶级压迫、剥削、奴役人民，他就不能不把兵士与人民分开，要他忘记自己的出身，处处脱离人民，反对人民，这就形成了一套军阀制度，用尽一切欺骗蒙蔽的方法，专门教育训练士兵，变成军阀私人升官发财的工具，盲目去为地主资产阶级服务，站在人民头上为非作恶。人民的军队是始终要使他知道自己是人民的子弟，应该永远与人民结合，为人民尽忠尽孝的。根据这个标准来检查我们的军队，大家看看，到底有多少真正合乎人民军队的本质，完全配称为人民的军队？从这次大会中，我们也可以看出我们军队是怎样脱离群众，是怎样欺负人民，压迫人民，曾经作了多少反人民的事情，这些，就是军阀主义的表现。抗战以来，由于华北是在八路军来后才打开局面，建立了各种政权、民众的组织，部队有些同志就发生一种错误的思想，以为天下是军队打下来的，人民是军队解放出来的，恰恰忘记了军队本来是人民组织起来的，人民正是为了自己的解放才组织起这支军队的，因此认为军队有功，应该高人一等，站在群众的头上为所欲为，要求群众向自己报功，处处拥护自己，于是打骂群众，强迫群众，损害群众利益的各种反人民的事情都发生了。有些部队对待人民的态度，甚至和军阀军队完全一样，这就是忘本，这就是对人民不忠不孝，这就是由人民的子弟变成人民的乱臣贼子。乱臣贼子，人人得而诛之。今后军队凡是有反人民的事情，大家都要起来干涉、反对；谁要拿武装去对着人民，这就犹如在火线上倒转枪口向自己的部队打是一样的，一定要当作反革命治罪。要是干部带着战士去作反人民的事情，战士不但不应接受这种反革命的命令，而且应将这种干部逮捕起来，送交人民法庭。只要战士觉悟提高了，那些为非作恶的反人民的命令就一定执行不通的，而且一定要受到严重的打击的。\n    第二，是要整军队的宗派主义。主要的表现是军队向人民向党闹独立性，成了惹不得的一窝蜂，凡是军队与人民发生了问题，军队总是不加考虑的毫无条件的站在军队方面讲话，俨然是一个与人民对立的军队帮。这种宗派主义是和军阀主义分不开的，主要的思想根源也就是认为军队有功，应该站在人民头上的错误思想作怪。有些干部还与军阀完全一样，把军队看成自己私人的，别人就惹不得。这在土改中表现得特别明显；凡是军属被斗了，军队总是毫无阶级立场毫无原则性的要求照顾，或直接袒护包庇，这种宗派主义是带着极大的盲目性的，因此被地主富农反革命分子乘隙利用，明明是人民敌对的斗争对象，一钻到部队，部队就把他当做自己人看待而袒护包庇起来，这批人明明是利用军队去欺压人民，我们军队就盲目地去支持他，还以为照顾干部和战士。例如汤阴大队和六纵队的归队营之打区村干部，都是由一两个坏分子挑拨煽动而发生的。这种与人民闹独立性的宗派主义，不管是盲目的与非盲目的，实质上都是反人民的，结果军队就会成为反人民的大集团。我们的军队是人民的军队，应该全心全意，好好为人民服务，不准向人民闹独立性而自成一派。一切问题的看法和处理，都要根据人民的利益和意见，人民是军队的生身父母和养身父母，即使有功也要归于人民。今后军队与人民发生了问题，我们绝不能简单地当作一种军民关系去看，也是要用阶级的立场观点方法去加以分析，看到底是反人民的，还是内部的纠纷问题；即使是内部的纠纷，也要明确的指出，这是军队没有很好为人民服务的表现，没有尽到作人民的忠臣孝子的责任，也应该受到批评和责备。\n    总而言之，为人民服务，是人民军队的本质，没有这一点就不能说是人民的军队，我们以后就要根据这个标准来检查。而且为人民服务不是抽象的，应该是具体的，不只是表现在作战和土地改革中，而且也表现在一切生活行动中。三大纪律、八项注意，就是一个具体的标准，这可以供我们来检查自己的部队，到底为人民服务了几分，是否配称为人民的军队，如果不配称为人民的军队，我们各级带兵的同志，就要反省自己为人民作了些什么事情？是否白吃了小米饭不给人民负责任？是否是自己的立场都有了问题？这是一点也不能含糊的。\n    毛主席、朱总司令在七大报告的论联合政府和论解放区战场中提出建军的三大原则，即建军的三大方针，我们要以此来检查、整顿，来肃清人民解放军中严重的普遍的向党向人民闹独立性的宗派主义与军阀主义思想。\n    大会开的很久，讨论得很多，我完全同意一波同志的总结，我相信我区要大大前进一步。全党在土地改革中同时整党整军，这就是建军二十六年来对我们的又一大考验。历史还要继续的考验我们，我们是应该经得起考验的。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th:  Kulun dispatch: The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party recently convened its 11th Congress, at which it adopted the first Five-Year Plan for economic and cultural development of the Mongolian People's Republic for 1948-1952. In his report on the Five-Year Plan at the Congress, Tsedendambaatar, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party, pointed out: \"Under the leadership of the People's Revolutionary Party and with the fraternal support of the Soviet Union, Mongolia, advancing towards socialism on a non-capitalist development path, has achieved significant accomplishments in economic and cultural aspects. Therefore, it has become even more necessary to continue promoting the Republic's economy and culture on the basis of a longer-term plan. The adoption of the Five-Year Plan marks a new stage in the country's development.\" Tsedendambaatar continued: \"The main tasks of the Five-Year Plan in the economic and political spheres are to utilize all resources to vigorously develop national productive forces. The plan stipulates that by the end of the five-year period, the number of livestock should increase to 31 million, and industrial output should increase by 96 percent compared to the present. In addition, the plan also stipulates improving existing state-owned farms, reclaiming large areas of wasteland, and expanding artificial irrigation. In education and culture, the plan stipulates implementing universal compulsory primary education in rural areas and promoting adult education, with the aim of completely eliminating adult illiteracy within five years. The plan also stipulates a large increase in schools, libraries, clubs, theaters, cinemas, and other educational institutions, as well as various medical institutions. During the Congress's discussion of the Five-Year Plan, Finance Minister Molomjamts pointed out: Mongolia has all the conditions to successfully complete and exceed the Five-Year Plan. Mongolian Prime Minister Choibalsan, in his address to the Congress on the 20th, also called on the people to realize the plan. People across the country have sent congratulatory telegrams to the Congress in recent days, guaranteeing that they will fully implement the Five-Year Plan. Note: The Mongolian People's Republic has an area of 1.5 million square kilometers and a population of approximately 900,000. In 1921, the Mongolian people rose up in revolution and established an independent revolutionary government. In 1924, the Mongolian People's Republic was proclaimed. In October 1945, Mongolia held a vote. One hundred percent of the people voted in favor of independence. However, the US and British imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, disregarding its contribution to defeating Japan, still oppose its participation in the United Nations. According to the Mongolian Constitution, land, natural resources, factories, mines, industries, transportation, banks, and hay-making stations (an important factor in the modernization of a pastoral nation) are all the property of the people and are operated by the state. This determines the prospect of the Mongolian People's Republic developing along a non-capitalist path. Under the leadership of the People's Revolutionary Party headed by Choibalsan, the nation's economy, politics, and culture have taken on a completely new look.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒙古人民革命党　通过蒙古五年计划　发展经济文化向社会主义前进\n\n1948-01-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒙古人民革命党\n  　通过蒙古五年计划\n    发展经济文化向社会主义前进\n    【新华社陕北二十四日电】库伦讯：蒙古人民革命党于日前召开十一届大会，会上通过一九四八——五二年蒙古人民共和国经济文化发展第一个五年计划。该党中央委员会总书记色杜巴在大会上就五年计划作报告时指出：“在人民革命党的领导与苏联情同手足的支援下，使在非资本主义发展道路上向社会主义迈进的蒙古，获得了经济与文化方面的重大成就。因此，在更长期计划的基础上继续促进共和国的经济和文化，已更为必要。五年计划的通过，标明国家发展进入了新的阶段。”色氏继称：“五年计划中经济政治的主要任务，在于利用一切资源，以大力发展国家生产力。计划规定五年期间终了时，牲畜数目应增至三千一百万头，工业产量应较现在增加百分之九十六。此外并规定改善现有国有农场，大量开垦荒地，扩大人工灌溉。在教育文化方面，规定在农村中实行普遍强迫的初步教育，并推行成年教育，以期在五年内彻底扫除成年文盲。计划并规定大量增加学校、图书馆、俱乐部、剧院、电影院等教育机关与各种医药机关。在大会讨论五年计划时，财政部长莫洛查指出：蒙古具有一切条件，足能胜利完成与超过五年计划，蒙古总理却伊巴桑二十日在大会致辞，亦号召人民实现计划。全国各地人民连日纷纷电贺大会，保证将全力履行五年计划。按：蒙古人民共和国面积一百五十万平方公里，人口约九十万。一九二一年，蒙古人民起来革命，成立了独立的革命政府。一九二四年，蒙古人民共和国宣布成立。一九四五年十月，蒙古举行投票。百分之百的人民赞成独立。然而美、英帝国主义及蒋匪却不顾它在击败日本中的功劳，迄今仍反对它参加联合国。根据蒙古宪法，土地、自然资源、工厂、矿山、工业、交通、银行以及干草制造站（为牧人国家现代化重要因素），均为全民财产，由国家经营。这就决定了蒙古人民共和国向非资本主义发展的前途。在却伊巴桑为首的人民革命党领导之下，全国经济政治文化，已焕然一新。"

    "content": "The Battle of Liberation of Yuncheng\n\n　　Since the Jin-South People's Liberation Army dealt a devastating blow to the Chiang bandit reinforcements in Yuncheng on November 21st of last year, the bandit army in Yuncheng, seeing that the reinforcements had fled, faced the crisis of being annihilated. Their only option was to rely on fortifications. They painstakingly rebuilt the outer pillboxes that had been destroyed by our army in the previous battle, completely reinforcing them with iron rails and steel plates, and installing telephones, lighting equipment, running water, and underground passages, creating relatively modern defensive works. At the same time, they completely replaced the local bandit troops who had been annihilated in the previous battle while defending the outer strongholds with regular troops. In this way, the bandit army believed they had created an impregnable defense, relying on strong outer strongholds and pillbox clusters to protect the city walls and outer moats, with heavy artillery fire from within the city supporting the outer pillbox fortifications, mutually dependent on each other.\n\n　　However, starting from December 17th, our army continued to completely encircle Yuncheng with superior forces and firepower, and quickly launched a mopping-up operation against the outer strongholds. From the 20th to the 22nd, in just three days, we completely cleared the outer strongholds, destroying more than ten strong pillboxes and more than fifty buried bunkers, annihilating more than 500 bandits (including more than 430 captured alive). At the same time, in this battle, even the bandit army's reliance on solid fortifications, such as the Majiayao in the southwest corner of the city and the Memorial Tower in the north of the city, which were considered two of the four major positions, were flattened by our army's fierce artillery bombardment in less than twenty minutes. Even their reliance on regular troops to hold firm, as in the battles at the large pillbox in the northwest corner of the city and the clusters of pillboxes in the southwest, resulted in the annihilation of entire platoons and companies upon contact with our army, with no one escaping. Even their reliance on artillery support from the city, as in the battle at the Memorial Tower (more than forty meters from the city wall), where the enemies on the city wall could even throw hand grenades, resulted in the complete suppression of the city wall's firepower under the coordinated action of our infantry, artillery, and engineers, and fierce attacks. In short, everything the bandit army relied upon became conditions for the People's Liberation Army to create a brilliant record of siege warfare, demonstrating the complete bankruptcy of the bandit army's foolish tactics of relying on strong fortifications, a large force, and holding out in an isolated city.\n\n　　As the People's Liberation Army completely cleared the bandit army's outer strongholds, the entire Yuncheng was exposed to the People's Liberation Army. On the 27th, the People's Liberation Army launched a general attack on the city wall. At this time, the Chiang bandit army hastily gathered eight brigades, including the First Brigade, the Seventy-eighth Brigade, and the Twenty-eighth Brigade, in the Shanzhou and Lingbao areas, attempting to cross the river and reinforce the city. However, the powerful People's Liberation Army, while fighting the reinforcements, continued to attack the city. The city attack began at 5:00 PM. Under the cover of fierce artillery fire, our brave demolitionists first used a large amount of explosives to blow a gap in the old North Gate, sending the defending bandits from the city wall dozens of meters into the air. Part of our army immediately broke into the city at a speed of thirty minutes. At this time, under the assistance of aircraft and the cover of fierce artillery fire, the bandit army launched more than ten counterattacks, attempting to close the breach and annihilate our army in the city. However, our brave artillerymen, in coordination with the infantry, concentrated even more intense artillery fire on the city wall and into the depth, immediately eliminating five companies of bandits in the city. The bandit army's desperate counterattacks turned into a panicked escape. Our troops rushed to climb the city wall and occupy the high ground of the iron factory, East Garden, Bell and Drum Tower, etc. After fierce fighting until dawn on the 28th, we annihilated more than 7,000 enemies (with more than 5,000 captured alive), and Yuncheng was completely occupied by us. The remaining 3,000 enemy troops, regardless of life or death, waded through the salt lake and fled south in disarray, but the next day they fell into our army's ambush north of Qilipo in Pinglu and were completely annihilated. In total, more than 10,000 enemies were annihilated before and after the battle.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 解放运城战役经过\n\n1948-01-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　解放运城战役经过\n    自去年十一月二十一日晋南人民解放军给增援运城蒋匪以歼灭性打击后，运城匪军眼看援兵回窜，将有被歼危机，唯一的办法，就是依靠工事，于是苦心把上次战役被我军摧毁的外围碉堡，完全以铁轨、钢板重新修复，并设置电话、照明器材、自来水及地下交通，构成较近代化的防御工事。同时，又把上次战役遭我歼灭性打击的困守外围据点的地方匪军，完全换成正规军。这样匪军便发现了以外围的强固据点碉堡群，保护城垣与外壕，以城内的强烈炮火，支援外围碉堡工事，互相依存，并自以为铜墙铁壁，不可攻破。\n    但是自十二月十七日开始，我军继续以优势的兵力火力，将运城完全包围，并迅速向外围据点展开扫荡，从二十日至二十二日三天当中，即把外围据点完全肃清，计摧毁强固碉堡十余座，及伏地碉五十余个，歼匪五百余名（其中包括活捉四百三十余名）。同时在此次战役中，匪军依靠坚固工事，也不过为城西南角马家窑及城北纪念塔所谓四大阵地之二的那样坚固，但一经我军猛烈炮火轰击，不及二十分钟，就被炸成平地。依靠正规军固守，也不过如城西北角大碉、西南群碉等地战斗那样，一经我军接触，全排全连被歼，无一漏网。依靠城里火力支援，也不过如纪念塔（距城四十余公尺）等地战斗那样，城垣的敌人甚至连手榴弹都可以扔过来，但在我步、炮、工协同动作，猛烈攻击之下，城垣的火力立即全被压下。总之，匪军依靠的一切，适为人民解放军创造攻坚战光辉纪录的条件，并说明匪军与强固工事依靠强大兵力困守孤城的愚笨战术，完全破产。\n    随着人民解放军完全扫清匪军外围据点之际，整个运城便赤裸裸暴露于人民解放军面前。廿七日人民解放军就向城垣展开总攻，此时蒋匪军又派出第一旅、七十八旅、二十八旅等八个旅，仓慌集结陕州、灵宝地区，企图过河增援，但是强大的人民解放军，一面与援军作战，一面继续攻城。攻城战斗自下午五时开始，在猛烈炮火掩护下，我英勇的爆炸手，首先以大量的炸药把旧北门掀开一个缺口，把守城匪军从城头掀向数十公尺之高空，我军一部即以三十分钟速度，突入城内，此时匪军在飞机助战及猛烈炮火掩护下，进行十余次反扑，企图合拢突破口，把我军消灭于城中，但我英勇的炮手，配合步兵，集中更多猛烈的炮火，打向城垣、打向纵深，当即消灭城中匪军五个连，匪军的拼命反扑，便变成狼狈逃命。我如万马奔腾、争相登城占领铁工厂、东花园、钟鼓楼等制高点，激战至二十八日拂晓，当歼敌七千余名（仅生俘即有五千余名），运城遂为我完全占领。另外三千残敌，当夜不顾死活，涉过盐池冲出，向南落荒而逃，但第二天即在平陆以北七里坡陷入我军预伏网中，全部被歼，总计前后歼敌万余人。"

    "content": "Poor and Hired Peasants Lead the Connection of the Poor\n　　Mianchi Peasants Avenge Themselves on Landlords\n[Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 4th Dispatch] After the liberation of Mianchi County, Western Henan, peasants rose up to denounce and avenge themselves on the landlords and local bullies. After the liberation of Mianchi County, reactionary landlords still wanted to rule the peasants by standing on the heads of the masses. Zhang Bingyi, the head of the reactionary landlord in Dongguan, spread rumors and threatened the masses, saying: \"The People's Liberation Army is here, and you are acting recklessly. I, Zhang Bingyi, am famous in Dongguan. Who doesn't know that? The township government can't do without me for every feast. Which of you poor people has ever been to one? The People's Liberation Army is like locusts in the autumn fields; how many times can they jump? The Central Army has been the Central Army for decades.\" The masses did not believe this. As soon as the movement started, Zhang Bingyi and Li Suqing, this gang of reactionary landlords, were afraid and ran away. After meetings and propaganda, the hired and poor masses knew that the Communist Party was working for the poor, and they slowly began the denunciation and revenge movement. The masses organized themselves to search the mountains and arrest landlords and local bullies. The masses in Nanyu Village investigated the children of the big landlord Zhang Bingyi and went up the mountain with sickles and axes at night to catch them. The villagers in Nanguan captured the father of the landlord Li Shuqing and immediately denounced him. Li Xiaozou and Song Heshang, poor and hired peasants from Zhuobai Village, five miles away from Dongguan, joined the Dongguan Farmers' Association and took the lead in organizing the poor people in their village, automatically distributing the landlords' grain, livestock, and baggage, and asked the working comrades in Dongguan to lead them. They also captured the escaped big local bully Zhang Bingyi and handed him over to the Dongguan peasants. At the rally to struggle against the landlord Zhang Bingyi, the peasant Zhang Qizhi said: \"The sky is clear, and I am not afraid of you today, Zhang Bingyi!\" Zhang Bingyi's nephew, Zhang Xiaoxue, denounced and beat Zhang Bingyi, saying: \"My land has just been plowed and is about to be planted, and you forced me to sell it to you. How did my brother die?! I am not afraid of you today.\" A few-year-old children also denounced how Zhang Bingyi seized their land and forced them and their elderly grandmothers to beg for food, and they beat him hard. The son of an old woman was killed by Zhang Bingyi. At the rally, she couldn't say a word and just cried loudly, shouting: \"Son, my son!\" All the peasants in the audience shed tears. Another old woman beat him and said: \"Zhang Bingyi, my house burned down, and you were happy to say it should. It is right for me to beat you today.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 贫雇带头串连穷人　渑池农民向地主复仇\n\n1948-01-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　贫雇带头串连穷人\n  　渑池农民向地主复仇\n    【本报太岳四日电】豫西渑池农民起来，向地主恶霸诉苦复仇。渑池县解放后，反动地主还想站在群众头上统治农民。东关的反动地主头子张秉义造谣威胁群众说：“人民解放军来了，你们胡干，我张秉义在东关是有名的，谁不知道？乡公所哪次请客也离不了我，你们穷人谁去过一次？人民解放军是秋地里的蝗虫，能跳几下？中央军是几十年的中央军了。”群众不信这一套。运动刚开始，张秉义和李肃庆这伙反动地主就害怕跑了。经过开会宣传，雇贫群众知道了共产党是给穷人办事的，慢慢开始了诉苦复仇运动。群众组织起来，自动搜山，捉地主恶霸。南峪村群众调查大地主张秉义的孩子，晚上便拿着镰刀斧头上山去抓。南关抓回地主李书庆的父亲，立刻诉苦。离东关五里地的卓白村贫雇农李小走、宋和尚，参加了东关农会后，带头把本村的穷人组织起来，自动的分了地主的粮食牲口和包袱，要求东关的工作同志领导他们干。还把逃跑了的大恶霸张秉义抓住交给了东关农民。斗争地主张秉义的大会上，农民张其芝说：“天爷可晴啦，张秉义今天我可不怕你了！”张秉义的侄子张小雪又诉又打的向张秉义说：“我的地刚犁过要去种，你就逼着要卖给你，我哥怎么死的？！今天我也不怕你了。”几岁的小孩也诉说了被张秉义霸走土地，逼得和年老的奶奶讨饭，说着便狠狠的打起来。一个老太太的儿子被张秉义害死，大会上她一句话也说不出来，光大声哭，喊着：“儿呀，我的儿呀！”全场农民都流下泪来。另一个老太太一面打，一面说：“张秉义，我的房子火烧了，你高兴的说应该，我今天打你也应该。”"

    "content": "Xingtai Two District Chiefs Go Deep to Employ the Poor\n  　Organizing Disaster Victims for Winter Production\n    [Report from this newspaper, Xingtai] In the previous period, winter production in Xingtai mostly revolved around middle peasants and some emancipated masses, without penetrating the poor laborers and disaster victims. Since the leadership proposed the issue of deeply mobilizing poor laborers, district cadres were determined to delve deeper and use accounting to identify disaster-stricken households. However, some village cadres, fearing that their villages would lose face, insisted, \"We have no disaster-stricken households; everyone has enough to eat.\" Sometimes, when cadres themselves found disaster-stricken households and calculated their deficits, village cadres would say, \"They are too 'backward'; who told them to be afraid to ask for their share during the fruit distribution?\" or \"They are too wasteful.\" In addition, some cadres came from poor backgrounds and, being full, did not understand the hunger of the poor and disaster victims, failing to see the honest poor laborers and disaster victims. For example, the head of the armed committee in Fanshang Village was a rich peasant. When district cadres asked him if there were any disaster-stricken households, he said there were none. Due to these obstacles, to deeply engage the poor laborers, it was necessary to bypass the cadres, understand the poor laborers and disaster victims, and then use the specific difficulties of the disaster victims themselves to change the cadres' thinking and solve the problems of the poor laborers. Zhangjia Village relied on poor laborers to find other poor laborers, and the results were accurate and thorough. After Comrade Wang Jingchun, the district chief of the Sixth District, personally investigated, he discovered a household named Xu Changzhi. After his \"emancipation,\" cadres said he was \"backward,\" and the farmers' association expelled him. Since last autumn, his family of three had only one dou of grain per person left. Others disliked his poverty and refused to form a production team with him. After understanding his situation and through accounting and mobilization, District Chief Wang decided to organize the poorest into a group to engage in winter production. After his search, he found six households, a total of eleven people, and organized them to focus on cutting firewood and incidentally collecting manure. Because they had little capital, they opened a small fodder shop, borrowing a temple courtyard as their address. The group members were very enthusiastic. A semi-able-bodied person could cut seventy jin of firewood a day, and the equivalent price was set, making them very motivated. After a period of thorough investigation, each village discovered the difficulties faced by poor laborers and disaster victims in production. District Chief Zhang of the Second District personally lent funds to the poor laborers in Lujiatun, the village with the most poor laborers. According to the conditions of the poor laborers, each village organized production activities such as weaving dustpans, mending shoes, selling tofu, weaving mats, and cutting firewood, and has achieved initial results.\n　(Chang Yan)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 邢台两区长深入雇贫　组织灾民冬季生产\n昌言\n1948-01-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　邢台两区长深入雇贫\n  　组织灾民冬季生产\n    【本报邢台讯】邢台冬季生产在上一时期多半在中农和一部分翻身群众的身上打圈子，并没有深入到雇贫和灾民身上。自领导上提出深入发动雇贫问题后，区干部决心往下钻，用算帐来发现受灾户。但有些村干部怕自己村落个面子不好看，硬说：“我们没有灾户，都够吃了。”有时干部自己去找着灾户算出窟窿，村干部会说：“他自己太‘落后’，谁叫他分果实时不敢要？”或“他太浪费。”另外有些干部出身就不好，饱汉子不知饿汉饥，看不见老实雇贫和灾户。如凡上村武委会主任是个富农，区干部问他还有没有灾户，他说没有了。由于有这些障碍，深入雇贫得下决心撇开干部，了解了雇贫灾户后，再用灾户本身具体困难去打通干部思想，去解决雇贫问题。张家庄依靠雇贫找雇贫，结果找的准又找的净。六区区长王景春同志亲自深入后，发现了一户叫许长志的，他“翻身”后，干部说他“落后”，农会便开除了他，他三口人去秋吃到现在，一口人只剩下一斗粮食了，别人嫌他穷，不与他合组生产。王区长了解了他的情况，经过算帐动员，他决心把这最贫的组织起一组，搞起冬季生产，经他一找，找到六户，共十一口人，组织起来，以割柴为主捎带拾粪。因没啥本钱，又开了个小草料铺，借了个庙院当地址。组员劲头都很大，半劳力割柴一天割七十斤，并规定了等价，干的很带劲。经过一个时期的深入，各村都发现了雇贫和灾户生产的困难，二区张区长亲自在雇贫最多村吕家屯亲手贷给雇贫款。各村根据雇贫条件，组织起编簸箕、掌鞋、卖豆腐、编席、打柴等生产，已获得初步成绩。\n　（昌言）"

His method is to first betroth his daughter to the militia captain of Baitao Village (already giving engagement gifts of one zhang three chi of black cloth, seven chi of blue cloth, and other items). Then, he secretly promised her to the militia instructor of his own village, and also to two ordinary villagers in his own village. He also promised her to cadres and ordinary people in Zhao Village, Linzhuang Village, and Qi Village, a total of seven people (including three cadres, one member of the theater troupe, and three ordinary people). He tells the ordinary people: I want to marry you, but the village cadres won't allow it. They are cadres, how dare we disobey them? Then he tells the cadres: I want to marry you, but the masses are not satisfied, the masses oppose it, etc. He goes to other villages and says: I want to marry you, but my own village won't let me leave. He is deliberately provoking disunity between villages, between cadres and the masses. This matter was discovered at a meeting of cadres and poor peasants throughout the district. (Bingcai, Wanying)\n    [Report from this newspaper in Cixian] Yang Quan, a resident of Xicheng Street in Cixian County, is 40 years old. He lost his wife last year, leaving behind three daughters. This spring, he married a 20-year-old woman who was a target of struggle. Because she had some education and pretended to be progressive, she was even elected as a production and emancipation committee member, leading women's production in Group ×. At first, she was particularly falsely active, not letting any of the women go home to sleep at night, but having them sleep together collectively. However, she went home every night herself. Later, after other women gave her suggestions, she then led the women to become corrupt, taking them to see operas every night. In the cotton spinning production, she sat by the stove drinking the good tea she bought herself, without even touching the spinning wheel. She didn't care about her family at all. She ignored the children when they called her \"Mom.\" When Yang Quan discussed family matters with her, she always said that she was too busy with her work. Yang Quan did not dare to say anything. After investigation by the masses, it was found that she was a target of struggle who only knew how to enjoy herself and could not endure hardship. She was expelled from membership. Local women are now figuring out how to deal with her finally.

    "content": "Nanzhuang Exposes False Reports by Village Cadres\n  　Resolves Funding Difficulties for Employing the Poor\n    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] The cadres of Nanzhuang Village in the Second District of Changzhi County were complacent and failed to resolve the funding difficulties for employing the poor in winter production, resulting in a poorly organized winter production effort. At a meeting of key members of the employed poor held on the 22nd of last month, the difficulties faced by the employed poor in winter production were examined. Huang Pangqing, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, stated: \"Our village's production is very lively. The reason that only a few of the employed poor are not participating in production is due to their lack of ideological understanding.\" The cadres' false reports were immediately exposed by the employed poor. Shen Lai'an said: \"There are fourteen households in my group, but only three have livestock. Those who have livestock all have their own ways. When I suggested that we go into production, they refused, and it couldn't get started. They're relying on begging again next year, acting as if they hadn't been emancipated.\" Chen Shui's mother said: \"My group wanted to buy livestock and asked me to invest. I don't have the money to invest. If I sell grain, I'm afraid of going hungry again. Everyone says I lack ideological understanding, to the point where I don't even dare to speak in the group.\" After these problems were discovered, an immediate investigation was conducted. Among the seventy-five households of the employed poor, there were sixty-five laborers, but only eighteen were engaged in production. It was also found that the distribution of loans was unfair. The village received a total of 410,000 yuan in loans, but one wealthy farmer and five middle farmers received 270,000 yuan, while the employed poor only received 140,000 yuan. After the investigation, the cadres made self-criticisms. Huang Pangqing, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, said: \"I was muddle-headed and thought our village's winter production was underway. I didn't realize that the employed poor were facing such great difficulties. I've been emancipated myself, but I haven't been earnestly serving the employed poor.\" The leadership also made self-criticisms and proposed to allocate all loans to the employed poor. After the employed poor received the loans, winter production in the village began to pick up. For example, Yang Guangde, an employed poor person, borrowed 100,000 yuan and the next day organized twelve employed poor households to sell bowls, five households to spin rope, and ten households to sell coal and charcoal. Everyone was working with great enthusiasm.\n\n    　　　　　　　　　　(Bao Liu, Yanzhang, Chentao, Xiangwen, Guoliang, Baozhi)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 南庄揭穿村干假报告　解决雇贫资金困难\n保刘　彦章　陈陶　相文　国良　保智\n1948-01-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　南庄揭穿村干假报告\n  　解决雇贫资金困难\n    【本报长治讯】长治二区南庄村干部思想自满，没解决雇贫冬产资金困难，冬季生产没有很好组织起来。上月二十二日召开雇贫骨干会议，检查冬季生产中雇贫的困难，农会主席黄胖庆说：咱村生产搞的很喧，少数雇贫没去生产，是他们思想不通。村干部的假报告立即被雇贫揭穿，申来安说：“我组有十四户，只有三个牲口，但有牲口的都是有办法的。我说咱去生产吧，人家不去，搞不起来，凭住明年再要饭吃，只当是没有翻身。”陈水只母亲说：“我组要买牲口，叫我入股，咱没钱入不起股，卖粮食又怕再挨饿，大家说咱思想不通，弄的我在组内连话都不敢说了。”发现这些问题后，当即检查，在七十五户雇贫中，共有劳力六十五人只有十八个出去生产。又发现贷款分配不公，全村共贷款四十一万元，一户富农，五户中农就贷有二十七万，雇贫只贷了十四万。检查后干部做了检讨，农会主席黄胖庆说：“我思想糊涂认为咱村冬季生产搞开了，没有想到雇贫还有这样大的困难，自己翻了身，没有认真给雇贫办事。”领导上也做了自我批评，提出要把贷款完全贷到雇贫身上，雇贫得到贷款后，该村冬季生产开始活跃起来。如雇贫杨广德，贷了十万元贷款，第二天就结合了雇贫十二户卖碗，五户纺绳，十户卖煤、炭，大家干的劲头很大。\n    　　　　　　　　　　（保刘、彦章、陈陶、相文、国良、保智）"

    "content": "International Week\n　　December 29th - January 4th\n\n    1947 has passed, and countries around the world have, as usual, made summaries of the past year. This summary paints two distinctly different pictures: light and darkness, happiness and pain. In the Soviet Union, the 1947 production plan has been basically and successfully completed and exceeded, the rationing of daily necessities has been abolished, and the overall industrial and agricultural production and the people's living standards have fully recovered and, in some parts, exceeded pre-war levels. Currently, the Soviet people are working hard and launching a revolutionary competition to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years. In the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, the economy is booming, and the lives of the working people have greatly improved. For example, in Yugoslavia, industrial production in the first eleven months of the first year of the Five-Year Plan exceeded the plan by 6.6 percent, and crop yields in 1947 increased by 2.4 percent compared with the average yield of the past ten years. In 1947, the average wage of workers and staff increased by 27 percent. More than one million working men and women spent their holidays happily in sanatoriums. But on the other side of the world, the corrupt capitalist world is in a state of \"destructive crisis.\" For example, the United States, which made a fortune in the war, has also experienced inflation, soaring prices, the general impoverishment of the people, and a sharp decline in their purchasing power, resulting in unsalable goods and mountains of inventory. At the end of 1947, goods worth 50 billion US dollars were piled up in warehouses. The number of unemployed is also increasing day by day, and it is estimated that it will reach 6 million to 8 million this year. The American government and the public are extremely shocked and pessimistic under the shadow of this impending economic crisis, and even many bourgeois economists have to lament: \"An economic crash will occur this year.\" The situation in Western Europe is even worse, and it is generally in a serious crisis of insufficient production. The British Labor government is even \"hesitating to publish the economic outlook for 1948.\" In \"gloomy France\" (as the newspaper \"New France\" says), the economic crisis is particularly serious. The Schumann reactionary government is trying to shift the burden of this crisis onto the shoulders of the French working people, and has therefore adopted a series of reactionary financial and economic measures, such as the emergency tax law, forcing people to buy 130 billion francs of public debt, and laying off large numbers of workers and staff. But this will not only fail to save the French economic crisis, but will also further prompt the starving people to rise up and fight for survival.\n    Northwestern Europe, which is in deep crisis, cannot but rely on and seek help from the thriving Eastern Europe. In the past week, in addition to the United Kingdom signing a draft business and loan agreement with the Soviet Union, Sweden, Norway with the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands with Czechoslovakia have successively signed barter agreements, and a Swiss business delegation is also about to go to the Soviet Union to negotiate trade agreements.\n    In the past week, the situation in France and Italy has still been seriously concerned by all parties. The reactionary financial and economic measures implemented by the French reactionary authorities to save their economic crisis have aroused strong resistance from the vast number of French people. The French farmers have begun to resolutely rise up to fight. More than 8,000 farmers in Dax County in southwestern France, unafraid of sacrifice and bloodshed, broke through the armed suppression of the police and held a large protest demonstration. \"L'Humanité\" called on the French people to form an alliance to fight for the protection of their lives. A delegation from the Seine Provincial Chamber of Commerce also visited the Communist Party members of the Economic Committee of the National Assembly, asking them to appeal for a reduction in tax rates and an exemption from emergency taxes. The \"National Committee of the Middle Class\" lodged a strong protest and warned that it \"will take necessary actions to resist all arbitrary decisions.\" In Italy, the People's Democratic Front, composed of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party and various progressive groups, has been formally announced. This great unity of the Italian people in struggle will be an important symbol of the in-depth development of the Italian people's democratic struggle.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国际一周　十二月二十九日——一月四日\n\n1948-01-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国际一周\n  　十二月二十九日——一月四日\n    一九四七年已经过去了，世界各国照例都作了一番一年来的总结，这个总结描划出了光明与黑暗、幸福与痛苦的两种显然不同的景况。在苏联，基本上已胜利完成并超过了一九四七年的生产计划，取消了日用品配给制，使整个工农业生产与人民生活水平完全恢复了并有一部分超过了战前水平。目前，苏联人民正奋不顾身为四年完成五年计划展开了革命的大竞赛。在东欧新民主主义诸国内，经济蒸蒸日上，劳动人民的生活大为改善。例如在南斯拉夫，五年计划头一年前十一个月的工业生产已超过计划百分之六点六，农作物产量，一九四七年较过去十年的平均产量增加了百分之二点四。一九四七年职工的平均工资增加了百分之二十七。有百余万劳动男女在疗养院中欢度假期。但在世界的另一面腐败的资本主义世界却正处在“毁灭性的危机”中。例如曾在战争中发财致富的美国，亦发生了通货膨胀物价飞涨、人民生活普遍贫困化及其购买力的大大降低，结果使商品卖不出去，存货堆积如山，一九四七年底有价值五百亿美元的货物堆积在货栈里。失业人数也日多，据估计今年将达六百万至八百万。美国朝野在这种迫近的经济危机阴影的笼罩下异常震惊和悲观，甚至许多资产阶级的经济学家，也不得不哀鸣：“今年将发生经济的暴跌。”西欧的情况，则更为恶劣，一般都处在生产不足的严重危机之中。英国工党政府甚至对“发表一九四八年的经济展望，踌躇不决”。在“暗淡的法国”（新法兰西报语），经济危机尤为严重。舒曼反动政府则力图把这一危机的重担转嫁到法国劳苦人民的肩上，因此采取了一连串反动的财政经济措施，如紧急征税法，强迫人民购买一千三百亿法郎的公债，以及解雇大批职工等，但这不仅不能挽救法国的经济危机，而且将更促使饥饿人民奋起为生存而战斗。\n    危机深重的西北欧，不能不依赖和仰求于欣欣向荣的东欧。一周来除英国与苏联签订了商务和贷款协定草约外，瑞典、挪威与苏联、荷兰与捷克之间均相继签订了换货协定，瑞士商务代表团亦行将赴苏商订贸易协定了。\n    过去一周法意局势仍为各方所严重注意。法国反动当局为了挽救其经济危机所实行的反动的财政经济措施，已激起了法国广大人民强烈的反抗。法国农民已开始坚决地起来斗争了。法国西南部达克斯县的八千余农民不怕牺牲流血，冲破警察的武装弹压举行了抗议大示威。人道报为此号召法国人民组成联盟，为保障生活而斗争。赛纳省商会代表团亦访问国民议会经济委员会共产党议员，要求代其呼吁减低税率和豁免紧急税。“中等阶级全国委员会”提出强硬抗议，并警告“将采取必要行动，以反抗一切专横决定。”在意大利由共、社两党及各进步团体所组成的人民民主阵线已正式宣告成立，意大利人民这种战斗大团结，将是意国人民民主斗争深入展开的重要标帜。"

The power of the village government is still in the hands of the local tyrant and rich peasant \"Xu family.\" Xu Lizhi has close ties with the Japanese devils and Yang, the captain of the Tunliu County Garrison; he still keeps more than a hundred sheep belonging to the traitor Yang. He even gave his daughter to a Japanese devil who was helping with trials in the county government as a goddaughter. Now, he is the manager of the Dongguan Cooperative. His younger brother, Xu Lizhi, is the accountant and vice chairman of the Farmers' Association. His brother Xu Xilai is also an accountant. Zeng Xihe (chairman of the Farmers' Association) also stands with them and follows the instructions of the Xu family. When collecting grain last month, the masses determined a reasonable burden quota at a mass meeting, with an average of 1.4 dou of grain per share. Nine poor and hired peasant families were not supposed to bear any burden at all. However, the Xu family felt that their burden was too heavy and said, \"Can you not bear any burden after liberation?\" So they privately revised the burden quota, adding 108 shares to the nine poor and hired peasant families who were not supposed to bear any burden at all. Tian Chuangze's original quota was 1.094 shares, but it was suddenly increased to 18 shares. Bao ×gen's original quota was 9.024 shares, and it was also increased to 18 shares. As a result, the Xu family's share was reduced by 0.41 dou per share, all added to the poor and hired peasants. When winter production began, the higher authorities called for solving the production difficulties of the poor and hired peasants. The Xu brothers felt that there was an opportunity to exploit, so the four brothers, along with their relatives Wang Tinggui, Yang Changfa of the dye shop, and Zeng Xihe, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, etc., took the cooperative's cotton ginning machine and valued it at 80,000 yuan, making it their family's private production equipment. They earned 150 yuan for ginning one jin of cotton, and they could gin 80 to 100 jin per day. They earned 80,000 yuan in one month, giving the money to the cooperative, and the machine became the private property of the eight families. When the poor and hired peasants wanted to take the oil from the cooperative to sell and earn some money, the Xu family flatly refused. They even said, \"Our oil mill's oil is not enough to sell!\" Gao Changfa and others had no livestock or capital to engage in production, and they were stuck at home with no way to make a living, but the Xu family did not care at all.

    "date": "1948-01-07",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "My Landlord Standpoint on Family Issues\n　　I was born into a feudal family of a small landlord cum commercial capitalist. During the Anti-Japanese War, my family was a landlord family with dual roles. I joined the revolution and the resistance against Japan as a family member of a revolutionary soldier, while my elder brother became a traitor and served as a family member of a traitor. In handling family issues, I failed to distinguish between loyalty and treachery, the lines were blurred, I planned for the exploitative life of the landlord family by placing care and liquidation on equal footing, demonstrating a serious landlord standpoint. After a year, three twists and turns, the family was finally dealt with.\n　　After the May 4th Directive, I saw the news report about Chairman Yang of Jize offering his land, and I thought to myself: I'll also \"offer land\" to pretend to be \"enlightened,\" and I might get praised, making a better impression on superiors, colleagues, and subordinates. But then I thought that my family only has forty-eight mu of land (before the war, we had over seventy mu of land, thirty-two rooms, a shoe shop, one-third share of a coal shop, two mules...) If I offer the land, the family's life will decline even further, so let's wait and see? This false \"offering land\" idea stemmed entirely from personal vanity.\n　　When I attended the Propaganda and Liaison Conference of the Prefectural Committee and conveyed the spirit of the May 4th Directive, I had two big joys: one was that the elimination of feudalism rather than the weakening of feudalism resolved the contradictions in my work. The other was that according to the Nine Articles of Care, my family could avoid being struggled against, and offering land wouldn't matter much. Clearly, my acceptance of the Party's May 4th land policy was based on two standpoints: the first joy was based on the work standpoint, and the second joy was based on the landlord standpoint.\n　　My family was originally a landlord family with dual roles, and the County Committee had quite a difficult time dealing with my family. After the Japanese surrender, when the County Committee discussed how to deal with my family, they had a strong sense of embarrassment and helplessness. They thought it would be best to divide the family, only confiscating my brother's share and leaving mine untouched. They said this and then dropped the matter. Later, the Jinnan Administrative Office issued instructions on handling the property of traitors. The County Party Secretary heard the masses' reflections that not dealing with my family would have a bad impact on the masses, so he secretly discussed with the County Chief, thinking that it would still be best to divide the family, confiscating one share and taking care of one share. Then they called me to a meeting, where it was decided to divide the family into three shares, confiscating one share, and setting aside four mu of land from the confiscated share to take care of me. First, I was to go home to divide the family and get my parents to agree. But I didn't go back to divide the family for a long time. It wasn't until the land reform movement in 1946 that the County Committee decided to use the method of \"one serving as two,\" taking out my brother's ten mu of land, considering it \"confiscated\" and also considered my father's \"offering land.\" The Farmers' Association announced to the masses: confiscating my brother's ten mu of land, and using the remaining four mu of land and a residence as \"care\" for me.\n　　My attitude towards handling the landlord family was not based on the masses. During the County Committee's discussion, I adopted the principle of \"saying less and listening more, making up my mind internally.\" Because the comrades of the County Committee had good feelings towards me, wouldn't they take care of me? I was afraid that saying too much would be unfavorable to my family, and saying too little wouldn't be \"enlightened.\" It was better for others to take care of me than for me to speak up myself. What decision was I making in my heart? I had already made careful plans: I decided to take out the living room, but I didn't say it, to see the County Committee's opinion. If the comrades' opinions exceeded this range, I would complain about the landlord family. If the comrades' opinions were smaller than this range, I would remain silent to express \"enlightenment\" and agree, showing my strong \"Party spirit.\"\n　　When it was being handled, I formally avoided it, but in my heart, I was already relieved because the County Committee had discussed it well. I was very satisfied with the handling result. First, I was satisfied with the \"one serving as two\" method; second, I was satisfied with the \"care\" for four mu of land and the \"care\" for a residence; third, my status as a family member of a revolutionary soldier was enhanced; fourth, my share in the family was enhanced, and my mother's attitude towards my wife improved; fifth, my family could join the Farmers' Association and even be distributed fruits according to the \"middle peasant\" standard. In fact, all of this was satisfaction representing the landlord's ideology.\n　　Through the general meeting's study and self-criticism and the help of comrades, I began to realize that my mistake was: my attitude and decisions towards the landlord family took advantage of the impure elements within the Party, followed the wind, and evaded the historical trial of the landlord class. First, it took advantage of the County Committee's lack of principle and emotionalism. Holding the attitude that if you are emotional, then I will have a landlord standpoint. Second, it took advantage of the masses' lack of awareness (Note: it was not that the masses lacked awareness but that the County Committee and village Farmers' Association did not allow the masses to express their opinions), using the \"one serving as two\" method, deceiving the masses. It took back the four mu of land and house that should have been confiscated from my brother from the peasants and used them for \"care\" for me. This took advantage of the May 4th Directive's loophole of care to protect the landlord family. In the land reform, \"the decisions I made\" were not based on satisfying the peasants' land demands, but stood on the original class standpoint, delaying the division of the family, preserving and protecting the landlord family. It obstructed the masses' emancipation from within the Party.\n　　The root cause of this erroneous thinking, after the help of comrades in the general meeting and group, was recognized as the landlord ideology brought from the original class, failing to draw a clear line with the family, not dividing the family from the landlord family, but dividing the family from the Party. This kind of thinking has a consistent historical root. I checked that when I was the Secretary of the District Committee in 1939, because the enemy swept through and took away a mule from my family, I used my familiar relationship with the branch Party members to mobilize money to buy back a mule to compensate for the family's losses, in order to maintain the exploitative life of the landlord family. I used my personal position to usurp the Party and serve the landlord family.

Comrades from the loan group went to the countryside separately, visiting poor peasants and hired laborers door-to-door to understand their situations. At the home of Wang Xinshan, an old hired laborer in Matoushan, the old couple were initially afraid to borrow because they were afraid they couldn't repay. However, they said that they had never owned a quilt in their lives, and they only exchanged for a new quilt last year by spinning cotton. This winter, they also wanted to get some capital to go to Anze to sell some grain to earn a profit, and explained that they would also be short of grain for two months next spring. At this time, the comrades of the loan group told him to borrow boldly, so he borrowed 20,000 yuan, planning to carry cotton. Tang Jiatai, a poor peasant and hired laborer in Houhe Village, was over fifty years old and had suffered poverty all his life. During the famine years, he herded sheep for people in Fushan and has not returned yet. His wife and a three or four-year-old girl at home were about to run out of food and had no cotton clothes to wear. They wanted to spin cotton but had no money to buy it. When the cotton loan group came to her home and told her that she could get a loan, she immediately said happily: \"If I can borrow some money to buy some cotton to spin thread and exchange it for some cloth, and earn some grain, my daughter and I won't starve to death next spring.\" The comrades of the loan group found the poor peasants and hired laborers to provide loans and did what they said. For example, when the loan group arrived at Handizhuang, five poor peasants and hired laborers wanted to buy some hemp to make some money, but they had no capital. After the loan group discussed it, they first lent them 120,000 yuan. Five days later, they came back and caught up with the distribution. Then, the poor peasants and hired laborers in Houhezhuang also borrowed 30,000 yuan to go to Jincheng for production. In this way, the poor peasants and hired laborers were very happy and believed that the government was really solving their production difficulties.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 沁水六区贷款组　亲访贫雇发贷款\n\n1948-01-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　沁水六区贷款组\n  　亲访贫雇发贷款\n    【本报太岳五日电】沁水六区冬季生产贷款组的办法是：一直到贫雇农家里把贷款送到贫雇农手里，帮他们出主意闹生产。贷款组的同志分头下乡，挨门挨户的到贫雇农家里了解情况，到马头山的一个老雇工王新山家里，老两口开头怕还不起不敢贷，可是说到他两口一辈子没有盖过被子，去年纺花才换了一条新被子，今年冬天还想弄几个本钱到安泽贩些粮食赚着吃，并说明年春天也缺两个月粮食。这时贷款组的同志叫他大胆的贷，他就贷了两万元，准备担棉花。后河村贫雇农唐家太五十多岁了，受了一辈子穷，灾荒年到浮山给人放羊，现在还没回来。老婆和三、四岁的一个女孩在家马上就没吃的，也没穿棉衣裳。想纺花没钱买，棉花贷款组到她家，给她说了能贷款后，她马上高兴的说：“要能贷点款买些花纺线换点布，赚点粮食，我娘们俩明年春天还饿不死。”贷款组的同志找到贫雇农贷款，说到就作到。如贷款组到了韩底庄，五个贫雇农想到长了买一些麻回来赚些钱，没有本钱，贷款组商量以后，就把贷款先借给他们十二万，五天回来，还赶上发放。接着后河庄贫雇农也借了三万到晋城去生产，这样贫雇农很高兴，相信了政府真的解决他们生产上的困难。"

Izvestia stated: The Soviet people have victoriously completed the recovery plan and are moving towards greater victories. Pravda stated: \"Completing the Five-Year Plan in Four Years,\" a slogan that resounds throughout the Soviet Union, is being transformed into new feats of selfless labor by Soviet patriots. One of the greatest domestic victories of the Soviet Union in 1947 was the abolition of the rationing system, currency reform, and local Soviet elections. The Soviet Union is the main force in the anti-imperialist camp against the mad plans to pursue global political hegemony. Pravda and Izvestia both pointed out: The people of Eastern Europe have shattered the chains of imperialism, causing the capitalist chains to break in several places, establishing new democratic countries here, and are now laying the foundation for the transition to socialism. As for the capitalist world, Pravda pointed out: Apart from destructive crises, the increasing impoverishment of the working people, the pain of unemployment, exploitation, brutal atrocities, the decline of morality and culture, and the horror of world war, there is nothing else to offer the people. Pravda emphasized: Everyone knows that the first sentence of the Communist Manifesto is: \"A specter is haunting Europe—the specter of communism.\" In our era, when the ideas of communism are grasped by hundreds of millions of people, it has become an indestructible and enormous material force proven by the entire course of historical development.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Moscow dispatch: The \"New Times\" New Year editorial stated: In the past year, the international situation has undergone major changes, which have further polarized the political forces on the international stage. 1947 gave the American and British imperialists a final exposure; they openly opposed international cooperation and attempted to forcibly impose an imperialist peace. 1947 brought many major victories to socialism and democracy. American imperialists have virtually lost the first stage of their battle in Europe. They have aroused the anger and hatred of the masses who disregard being slaves of the aggressors across the Atlantic. The developments in Greece and the events in France and Italy serve as stern warnings. The capitalist world cannot escape the predicament of unsolvable economic difficulties. The United States, which serves as the pillar of the capitalist system, is suffering from a recession and knows that an economic crisis is inevitably approaching. On the other hand, the national economies of the Soviet Union and the democratic countries of Eastern Europe have greatly surpassed pre-war levels. The masters of the capitalist world feel the instability of their position and fear their inevitable failure in peaceful competition with socialism, so they are plotting new conspiracies and formulating evil plans. In addition to economic and political blackmail, they are also using the threat of the atomic bomb. The poisoned arrows of anti-communism have been widely used. Washington has mobilized the right-wing elements of the Socialist Party and the Labour Party to divide the ranks of the working class. However, their attempts cannot stop the growth of the communist movement and its influence among the masses. Not only is the position of European capitalism shaken, but the entire capitalist system is approaching its death. No prescription can cure the serious illness of capitalism, nor can it stop the development of progressive society. Mankind has firmly embarked on the path of socialism—the only path that can liberate us from imperialist exploitation, poverty, and the terror of new wars. We are living in an era where every road leads to communism, and every New Year brings us closer to this great goal.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏联各报论国际形势　苏联胜利完成了复原计划　东欧已打碎帝国主义锁链\n\n1948-01-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏联各报论国际形势\n    苏联胜利完成了复原计划\n  　东欧已打碎帝国主义锁链\n    【新华社陕北四日电】莫斯科讯：联共党与苏联政府机关报，于元旦均发表重要社论，指出一年来苏联与新民主国家的重大的成就与资本主义世界之面临毁灭性危机。消息报称：苏联人民胜利地完成了复原计划，朝着更大的胜利前进。真理报称：“五年计划四年完成”这一响遍全苏的口号，正被变为苏联爱国者奋不顾身的劳作新伟绩。一九四七年苏联内政最大胜利之一，就是废除配给制、货币改革和地方苏维埃选举。苏联是反对追求全世界政治霸权的疯狂计划的反帝阵营的主力。真理报和消息报一致指出：东欧人民已经粉碎了帝国主义锁链，使资本主义的链子崩裂好几环，在这里创立了新民主主义国家，现在正在奠定过渡到社会主义的基础。至于资本主义世界，真理报指出：除了毁灭性危机，除了劳动人民的日益赤贫，除了失业的痛苦、剥削、残酷的暴行、道德与文化的衰退，除了世界大战的恐怖之外，再也不能给人民以什么别的东西。真理报着重指出：大家知道，共产党宣言的第一句话是：“一个幽灵，共产主义的幽灵正在欧洲踯躅”。在我们这时代，当共产主义的思想为千百万人所掌握的时候，它已成了为整个历史发展过程所证明的不可摧毁的巨大物质力量。\n    【新华社陕北五日电】莫斯科讯：“新时代”新年社论称：一年来国际形势又发生了重大变化，这种变化，使国际舞台上的政治力量更加各趋一端。一九四七年给了美、英帝国主义者一个最后的暴露，他们公开反对国际合作，企图强行帝国主义和平。一九四七年给社会主义与民主主义带来了许多重大胜利，美帝国主义者在欧洲战斗的第一阶段实际上已经输了，他们激起了不顾当大西洋彼岸侵略者的奴隶的人民群众的愤怒和憎恨。希腊的发展与法、意的事件，正是一个严厉的警告。资本主义世界无法摆脱不能解决的经济困难的苦境。充当资本主义体系台柱的美国，苦于市景萧条，晓得经济危机正在无可避免地日益迫近。另一面，苏联与东南欧民主国家的国民经济大踏步地超过战前水平。资本主义世界的主人们感觉到他们地位的不稳，并且害怕他们在与社会主义作和平竞争中的必然失败，于是便策划新阴谋，拟制罪恶的计划。除了经济与政治的讹诈之外，还辅之以原子弹的吓唬。反共的毒矢又被大肆运用了。华盛顿动员了社会党和工党右翼分子来分裂劳工阶级的行列。可是，他们的企图不能阻止共产主义运动及其在群众中影响的增长，不仅欧洲资本主义的地位动摇了，而且整个资本主义制度正在逼近死亡。任何药方都治不了资本主义的重病，停不住进步社会的发展。人类已经坚定地走上了社会主义的道路——唯一可以从帝国主义剥削、贫穷与新战争恐怖中解放出来的道路。我们所处的正是一个条条道路通达共产主义的时代，而每一个新年都使我们更接近于这伟大的目标。"

According to the year-end report released by the US Department of Commerce on the 30th of last month, the wholesale prices of daily necessities have climbed to the highest peak of 1920, more than twice the average figure of 1939, while the prices of agricultural products have even exceeded the peak of 1920 and are still soaring. The report also stated that the average wholesale price in 1947 increased by a quarter compared to 1946. Due to soaring prices, the lives of the American working people are becoming increasingly difficult. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a working family of four needs a weekly income of $70 to maintain a \"normal standard of living.\" Therefore, if a couple's weekly income is $60, they cannot support the lives of two children. Inventories at the end of 1947 have accumulated to $50 billion.\n\nAmidst inflation, declining purchasing power of the masses, and increasing inventories, both the American government and the public are worried about whether an economic crisis will occur in the United States this year. Some economists have expressed \"pessimism.\" Economist George declared that he estimates a possible economic crash (i.e., economic crisis) will occur this year. Economist Kapulan, based on the fact that people's income cannot increase, also foresees an economic crash. Former CIO economic advisor, economist Nathan, estimates that the number of unemployed in the US this year will reach six million to eight million.

    "content": "[Reported from Shahe by this newspaper] The Ge Village Cooperative in the Sixth District has been established for almost two years without ever providing an accounting to the masses. At that time, it was all set up using the fruits of the peasant association's struggles. The masses did not receive any of the fruits, and have not benefited from the cooperative to this day. Recent inspections revealed that the cooperative was controlled by a group of struggle targets. Although the cooperative chairman is a poor peasant, he is too honest and cautious, and only afraid of losing money, so he dares not act. (Is it really that the poor peasant chairman is incompetent? Or is it that the leadership didn't let go to the poor and hired peasants, and didn't give them a correct direction? Hoping for inspection – Editor). The accountant is a managing landlord. Of the three people in the oil mill, two are managing landlords who haven't been struggled against, and one is a landlord. This group of people eats their fill inside. Whether they claim a loss or a profit, it's whatever they say. In the oil mill, they eat well every night, and you can smell the aroma from far away. The poor and hired peasants in the village often reflect, saying: \"So many fruits of struggle are nourishing a group of struggle targets. Is this benefiting the masses?\" Cadres take money from the cooperative for personal use at will. In the summer, because of continuous rain, the masses didn't have grass to feed their livestock, so they went to the cooperative to buy sesame cakes (for livestock feed). The cooperative said: The cadres have bought all the sesame cakes and won't sell them to you. (In reality, the cadres didn't buy them). After the autumn harvest, when launching winter production, they emphasized taking care of the poor and hired peasants and solving their difficulties. The masses' dissatisfaction with the cooperative became even more apparent. When they bought oil from the cooperative, they wouldn't pay for it. As soon as they were asked for money, the masses would say: \"I didn't get any of the fruits in the past. Now, not paying for this little bit of oil isn't even enough to compensate for my fruits!\" In less than two months, more than 400,000 yuan was owed on credit. Because of the influence of the large cooperative, there were also difficulties in setting up small cooperatives in each group. For example, the first, second, and sixth groups all wanted to set up flower mills and oil mills, but the masses wouldn't invest. Zhang Shuangxi said: \"The large cooperative has been running for two years, and who has benefited from it? No matter how you do it, I definitely won't invest.\" Shen Mang said: \"We're setting up a flower mill again? The large cooperative's flower mill has been running for two years, and so far, let alone how much money it has made, it hasn't even given an accounting. I won't invest.\" At this time, the leadership mobilized and explained, emphasizing that in the future, the poor and hired peasants would be in power, and elect the poor and hired peasants to run it themselves. Shuangxi said: \"If we run it ourselves, then that's okay?\" Everyone started investing. Mang invested 2,000 yuan first. Later, Zhang Aixi (a poor peasant) was elected as a cadre, and Mang invested another 8,000 yuan. However, the real power of the small cooperative in the first and second groups was in the hands of the village chief (the village chief is a landlord who has not been struggled against). He also selected two middle peasant cadres. After raising capital, they first went to buy a cotton gin, but after buying it back, it sat idle for a month. Zhang Aixi was only in charge of keeping the money. The accountant sealed up the money collected every day in a cabinet and gave it to Shuangxi. Whenever he needed to spend money, he would go to Shuangxi's house to get it. Not only did the cotton gin not move, but the village chief took 30,000 yuan from it and went to Yongnian to buy back 3,000 jin of sesame cakes, earning 36,000 yuan, which all became his own. The masses reflected, saying: \"Our flower mill bought back the gin a month ago and it hasn't moved, but someone took the money and went to do his own business.\" The oil mill in the seventh group was the same. On the surface, it also said that the poor and hired peasants were in power, and the militia instructor (a poor peasant) was made a nominal chairman, and the peasant association director (a poor peasant) managed the money (also like Zhang Aixi). In reality, three rich peasants were in control. After discovering these problems, in addition to immediately resolving them, a full village inspection is underway to see if other small cooperatives also have this problem. It is currently being resolved and inspected.\n                                                                                                (Hu Xianxiao, Kui Lin)\nThe large cooperative is controlled by landlords and rich peasants, and the leadership is bureaucratic, not solving the problems, but only talking about letting the poor and hired peasants be in power, developing small cooperatives. As a result, the small cooperatives are also controlled by landlords and rich peasants. It is said that the poor and hired peasants are in power, but the result is that the hired and poor become \"sidekicks.\" Is this caused by the leadership's opportunistic thinking and bureaucracy? The comrades leading the work in this village should conduct self-reflection and inspection, and publicly respond in the newspaper.\n                                                                                                ——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 葛村合作社需要检查　斗争果实养活斗争对象　贫雇未能当权做了陪客\n胡先孝　奎林\n1948-01-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　葛村合作社需要检查\n    斗争果实养活斗争对象\n  　贫雇未能当权做了陪客\n    【本报沙河讯】六区葛村合作社自成立起来快两年了，没有给群众算过帐。那时都是用农会的斗争果实搞起来的，群众没有分到果实，至今也没有得过合作社的利益，经最近检查结果，原来是合作社被一伙斗争对象给掌握起来，社长虽然是个贫农，但因太老实、小心、光怕赔了钱不敢干。（究竟是贫农社长无能呢？还是领导上没放手给贫雇，没给贫雇一个正确方针呢？望检查——编者）会计是个经营地主，油坊三个人，两个是没有斗过的经营地主，一个是地主。他们这一伙人吃到里边，说赔算赔，说赚算赚，油坊里每天夜里吃好饭，远远就闻见香味了。村里贫雇经常反映说：“这么些斗争果实，养活着一群斗争对象，这是不是给群众谋利呢？”干部们随便从社里拿钱去用，群众夏天因连阴，没草喂牲口，到社里去买麻饼（喂牲口）。社里说：麻饼干部都买下了，不卖给。（实际上干部没有买）秋收以后，发动冬季生产时，强调提出照顾贫雇，解决困难，群众对合作社的不满更加表面化了，他们在合作社买了油也就不给钱了，一要钱群众就说：“过去我没分了果实现在赊这点帐还不够我的果实哩！”不到两个月就赊出了四十多万元。因为大合作社的影响，各组搞小型社时也受了困难。如一、二组、六组都想搞花坊油坊，但是群众都不集股，张双喜说：“大合作社搞了两年，谁得过一点利来？不管怎样搞，我反正是不入股”。申忙的说：“咱又搞花坊哩，大合作社的花坊两年了，至今别说赚钱多少，就是连帐也没给算过，我可不入股。”这时领导上就动员解释，强调说明以后要让贫雇掌权，选举贫雇自己干。双喜说：“要是咱自己干那还不行？”大家就入起股来，忙的先入了两千元，后来就选了张艾喜（贫农）当干部，忙的就又入了八千元，但是一、二组小型社的实权是掌握在村长手里（村长是个没有被斗的地主），他又选出了两个中农干部，集起股后就先去买了个弹花车子，但买回来放了一个月没有动弹，张艾喜只管放钱，会计把每天收起的钱封住一柜交给双喜，啥时花啥时到双喜家去拿，弹花弓没有动还不算，村长从里边拿了三万元到永年去买回来三千斤麻饼，赚了三万六千元，都成了他自己的。群众反映说：“咱这花坊买回弓来一个月不动，人家拿上钱去干自己的买卖了。”第七组的油坊也是一样，表面上也是说贫雇掌权，让民兵指导员（贫农）当了个名义社长，农会主任（贫农）管钱（也和张艾喜一样），实际上是三个富农在里边掌握实权。发现以上这些问题后，除马上解决处理外，并正在全村展开检查，看其他小型社中是否也有这种问题，现正解决和检查中。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（胡先孝、奎林）    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    大合作社被地主富农掌握，领导上官僚主义，不解决问题，却又空谈让贫雇掌权，发展小型社，结果小型社又被地主富农掌握。说的是贫雇当权，但结果雇贫变成“陪客”，这是不是领导上的投机思想官僚主义造成的？领导该村工作的同志应作反省检查，并在报上公开答复。　\n　　　——编者"

    "date": "1948-01-07",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "(Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, 5th) Our frontline reporter analyzed the military situation between the enemy and ourselves in the Dabie Mountains over the past month on New Year's Eve, saying: Chiang Kai-shek's troops, feeling that our various counter-offensive armies had penetrated deep into the north bank of the Yangtze River, and that the guerrilla warfare in the south of the Yangtze River was also echoing across the river, creating a situation where they might join forces with our main army to cross the river, severely stinging the heart of the Chiang-controlled areas; and also feeling that the battles in Longhai and Jiaodong had repeatedly suffered defeats, could not but announce that \"the key military focus in the future will shift to between the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers,\" and immediately transferred the entire 9th Division, one brigade of the 11th Division, the 20th Division, the 25th Division, and the 28th Division from Longhai and Jiaodong to the Dabie Mountains, and combined them with the original 7th, 10th, 46th, 48th, 52nd, 56th, 58th, 74th, 85th Divisions, and the 202nd and 203rd Divisions of the Youth Army in the Dabie Mountains, totaling 33 brigades, to carry out so-called \"sweeping\" and \"encirclement\" operations against our Dabie Mountain area starting on December 1st; that is to say, Chiang Kai-shek's so-called \"sweeping\" and \"encirclement\" of the Dabie Mountains occurred under the circumstances of his Yangtze River being shocked, the defeats in Longhai and Jiaodong, and the public announcement and actual retreat from the Yellow River to the Yangtze River, implementing his strategic key defense. Chiang Kai-shek's so-called \"sweeping\" of the Dabie Mountains has been going on for a month now; what has Chiang Kai-shek accomplished in this month? What has he gained? Chiang Kai-shek once followed the mantle of the former commander of the Japanese Army stationed in China, Nobusuke Kishi, who is still in Nanjing today as a guest and top advisor to Chiang Kai-shek, in the \"sweeping\" of the Eighth Route Army in North China during the War of Resistance, deploying and launching the strength of his 33 brigades. However, due to the weakening of Chiang Kai-shek's forces and the decline of morale, due to the complexity of the terrain in the Dabie Mountains, and especially due to the close connection between the people of the Dabie Mountains and the People's Liberation Army for three months, and the unanimous struggle against the enemy under the land reform movement, the enemy, once entering the Dabie Mountains, was like a blind man groping for fish, and was attacked by the army and people of the Dabie Mountains everywhere. The guerrilla warfare of the common people, combined with the field army, launched anti-\"sweeping\" and anti-\"encirclement\" struggles everywhere, killing and wounding Chiang Kai-shek's troops, so that Chiang Kai-shek was either beaten in the front or attacked in the rear. The attacks on Lihuang, Taihu, Yingshan, Susong, Yuexi and other cities by us, and the annihilation of the Youth Army in Guangji City, are all good examples. A captured soldier of the 118th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's 11th Division said: \"Coming here is really too hard for us. We walk every day without seeing the common people. We rob the common people of things to eat, but we are still hungry every day. If we are not careful, we will be killed by your militia. Especially, we don't know when we will be annihilated by you, so everyone wants to desert!\" This is the best portrayal of Chiang Kai-shek's army. In the past month, Chiang Kai-shek's so-called \"sweeping\" of the Dabie Mountains has gained nothing. If he has gained anything, it is being exhausted, running around in vain, and losing troops. Chiang Kai-shek also attempted to use the Pinghan Railway as the axis of mobile operations, thinking that this would prevent our army from moving, but this is just a dream. In this month, our army not only quickly deployed our forces to the Tongbai and Jianghan areas west of the Pinghan Road, but also, like autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves, successively captured Tongbai, Zaoyang, Xinye, Qianjiang, Zhongxiang, Tianmen, Jingshan, and Mianyang county towns, annihilating the local Chiang Kai-shek bandits, liberating the people there, and shaking Jianghan; forcing the 85th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's army east of the road to rush to the west of the road to deal with it. Recently, due to the great victory of our Su-Lu-Yu-Wan and Yu-Shaan-E field armies in the southern section of the Pinghan Road, and the continued expansion of brilliant results towards Xuchang and Xinyang, annihilating the entire 3rd Division and giving the 20th Division a destructive blow, this is another disastrous defeat in the war situation that Chiang Kai-shek did not expect. Now the Dabie Mountain area has obtained the coordinated actions of our friendly neighboring forces, and in the anti-\"sweeping\" war, it can expand the results of the war even more. As for crossing the Yangtze River to the south or crossing the Han River to the west in the future, it is even more convenient. Chiang Kai-shek's so-called \"sweeping\" in the Dabie Mountain area for a month has not only gained nothing, but also suffered losses. He has also lost troops and generals west of the Pinghan Road, which makes Chiang Kai-shek even more in a dilemma and unable to laugh or cry in the Dabie Mountains. For the people of the Dabie Mountains: the vivid facts in this Chiang Kai-shek \"sweeping\" have once again proved to the people that the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army are truly helping the people themselves and establishing patriotic and democratic governments to protect them, while the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and its bandit army are maintaining the rule of landlords, bullies, special agents, and baojia, grabbing grain, conscripting soldiers, oppressing, destroying, and slaughtering the people; only resolutely cooperating with the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army and overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek is the way out. The facts of a month fully prove that the ever-victorious People's Liberation Army and the people of the Dabie Mountains who have awakened and are awakening are not to be trifled with. Chiang Kai-shek should learn a profound lesson from this. General Liu Bocheng said well, he said: \"Although the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is anxiously trying to take care of both sides day and night, in the lesson of the line being cut off and the points being surrounded, Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and anti-people war, after its elite has been greatly lost, has been annihilated in a series, and no matter what, both sides cannot be taken care of, and both sides will fail.\" Of course, we should and will recognize Chiang Kai-shek's activities in the Dabie Mountains. The dying Chiang Kai-shek must make a dying struggle. Therefore, the entire army and people of the Dabie Mountains must further establish a tenacious will on the basis of the victorious confidence of a month of struggle, further strengthen the combination of people's guerrilla warfare and land reform, and the combination with regular operations, and resolutely smash Chiang Kai-shek's dying \"sweeping\" of the Dabie Mountains.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋匪实施重点防御一月扫荡毫无所获　前线记者评大别山形势\n\n1948-01-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋匪实施重点防御一月扫荡毫无所获\n    前线记者评大别山形势\n    【新华社鄂豫皖前线五日电】前线记者于除夕分析大别山一个月来敌我军事形势说：蒋匪感于我各路反攻大军深入长江北岸，江南游击战争也隔江呼应，大有接应我大军渡江之势，严重的刺痛蒋管区的心脏；同时还感于陇海、胶东的战局接连遭到失败，才不能不宣布所谓“今后军事重点将转移到长江与黄河之间”，并随即将陇海、胶东的整九师一个旅、整十一师、整廿师、整二十五师、整二十八师赶调大别山，并纠合其原在大别山之整七、整十、四十六、四十八、五十二、五十六、五十八、七十四、八十五及青年军之二○二、二○三等师，共计达三十三个旅之众，于十二月一号开始对我大别山区的所谓“扫荡”、“清剿”；这就是说蒋匪对大别山的所谓“扫荡”、“清剿”是在他长江震惊、陇海胶东失败，并公开宣布和实际上从黄河大退，退到长江，实施其战略性的重点防御的状况下出现的。蒋匪对大别山的所谓“扫荡”，直至今天已经进行了一个月了；这一个月中蒋匪有什么作为呢？得到了什么呢？蒋匪曾经依照前日寇驻华派遣军司令，今天仍在南京作蒋匪上宾及最高顾问的战犯冈村宁次在抗战中对华北八路军“扫荡”的衣钵，布署和开展了他三十三个旅的兵力。然而由于蒋匪兵力的削弱和士气的低落，由于大别山地形的复杂，特别是由于大别山人民三个月来已经与人民解放军有着密切的联系，在土地改革运动下一致对敌斗争，使敌人一进到大别山就象瞎子摸鱼，到处遭到大别山军民的打击。老百姓的游击战争与野战军结合起来，到处展开反“扫荡”反“清剿”的斗争，杀伤蒋匪人马，使蒋匪不是前面挨打就是后方受到袭击。立煌、太湖、英山、宿松、岳西等城被我袭击，广济城青年军的被歼灭等都是很好的例子。被俘的蒋匪整十一师一一八旅的士兵说：“到这里来我们实在太苦了，天天走路见不到老百姓，抢老百姓的东西吃还是天天要挨饿，一不小心就被你们的民兵打死，特别是不知道什么时候就会被你们歼灭，所以谁也想开小差！”这就是蒋匪军自己最好的写照。一个月来蒋匪对大别山的所谓“扫荡”并没有得到什么东西，如果得到了的话，那就是疲于奔命，到处扑空和丧师减员。蒋匪也还企图以平汉铁路为机动作战的轴心，认为这就可以阻止我军的活动，但是这只是一个梦想而已。在这一个月中，我军不仅很快的向平汉路西之桐柏、江汉区展开了我军的兵力，而且在那里象秋风扫落叶似的接连打下桐柏、枣阳、新野、潜江、钟祥、天门、京山、沔阳等县城，歼灭那里的土蒋匪，解放那里的人民，威震江汉；使路东之蒋匪军八十五师不得不仓惶调到路西应付。最近更由于我苏鲁豫皖、豫陕鄂各地野战军在平汉路南段破击大胜利后，继续向许昌、信阳间扩张辉煌的战果，歼灭了整三师，并予二十师以歼灭性的打击，这是蒋贼意料所不及的另一方面战局的惨败。现在大别山区获得我友邻部队的协同动作，在反“扫荡”战中就更可以扩张战果，至于今后南渡长江或西渡汉水都更方便了。蒋匪在大别山区一个月的所谓“扫荡”，既是毫无所获，而且遭受损失，在平汉路西又损兵折将，这就更使蒋匪在大别山进退两难啼笑皆非了。对于大别山人民来说：这次蒋匪“扫荡”中活生生的事实又一次给人民证明了共产党解放军是真正帮助人民自身和建立爱国民主政府保护他们的，而蒋介石匪帮及其匪军却是维护地主恶霸特务保甲统治，抢粮抓丁，压迫摧残和屠杀人民的凶手；只有坚决与共产党解放军密切合作，打倒蒋介石才是出路。一个月的事实完全证明常胜的人民解放军和已经觉悟与正在觉悟中的大别山人民是不好惹的，蒋匪应该从这里得到深刻的教训。刘伯承将军说得好，他说：“尽管蒋介石匪帮在领略线线被截断、点点被包围的教训中，日夜苦心焦急，想作到彼此兼顾，但蒋匪卖国的反人民的战争，在其精锐大大丧失之后，又复连串的被歼，无论如何都是彼此都顾不着，彼此都要失败的。”自然我们还应该而且会认识蒋匪对大别山的活动，垂死的蒋匪必然要作垂死的挣扎的。因此大别山全体军民在一个月斗争胜利信心的基础上要更进一步树立起顽强意志，更加强化人民游击战斗与土改的结合及与正规作战的结合，坚决粉碎蒋匪对大别山的垂死“扫荡”。"

    "content": "\"This way we can all turn ourselves over completely!\"\n    Poor and landless peasants enthusiastically support the Land Law\n    [This newspaper's dispatch] The \"Outline Land Law of China\" promulgated by the Communist Party of China has been enthusiastically supported by peasants. The peasants of Chengguan, Licheng said: \"This way we can all turn ourselves over completely!\" When the newspaper carrying the \"Outline Land Law\" arrived in Chengguan, Licheng, people crowded around the oil lamps of various offices, organizations, schools, and shops; some read, and those who couldn't understand asked others to read it aloud. Poor peasant Ren Xinnian said: \"The struggle against landlords last year was not thorough; the cadres discussed it first, taking care of the landlords' lives. The distribution was also unfair. The landlords' dog food was better than the peasants' meals, I saw it with my own eyes after herding sheep for more than ten years.\" Middle peasant Wang Shengcai said: \"The landlord Wang Tianzhang and Li Baoyuan oppressed people for a lifetime, and only after the New Year and winter did they turn out just over ten mu of land. He obviously had silver dollars, yuanbao, and possessions, but he would rather die than take them out. In the autumn, four large vats were dug out from under his cellar, can you see how hateful the landlord is!\" Poor peasant Li Jinde said: \"In the past, landlords and rich peasants had a lot of land, and out of the twenty households in our street, eighteen were being exploited by those two families. Do you think that's equality! In the past, the land distributed to schools and organizations was all good land, this time let's divide it equally, with this land, it will be almost enough to make up for our needs.\" More than two hundred peasants in Chengjiashan Village, Second District, studied the \"Outline Land Law\" in the winter school, and everyone argued about the matter of giving land to landlords. Farmhand Xiao Rui said: \"We must first satisfy the demands of us peasants, then we can give him a share. This is the leniency of us peasants towards the landlords.\" The peasants of Sanwang Village, Wu'an, were very satisfied with \"drawing from the surplus to make up for the deficit\" and \"drawing from the fertile to make up for the barren\" when they heard the cadres read the \"Outline Land Law.\" Poor peasant Zhang Liutang said: \"Equality, equality, it won't be evened out if it's done wrong like this.\"\n    　　　　Understanding it yourself before explaining it to others\n    Judging from some reports, there are still incorrect understandings and propaganda regarding the Land Law in some places. Contribution from Zuoquan: After the newspaper arrived, the Fourth District Committee convened a symposium of cadres from various systems to discuss the Land Law. Comrade Zhao Zhankui said: \"After hearing this report, my ideological problems have been resolved!\" \"On the same morning, we received a letter from the County Committee, convening a meeting of main village-level cadres in the entire district to convey the Central Land Law Outline,\" \"The District Committee decided to hold meetings of village branch secretaries and main cadres in three locations\" to convey the message. \"Comrade Li Guifu was so happy that after the symposium in the morning, he took the newspaper with him when he went to the countryside!\" We feel that: explaining the Land Law Outline should be very cautious and meticulous. We should thoroughly clear the cadres' minds, rectify the ranks, and establish the fundamental concept of serving poor and landless peasants, only then can we understand the true meaning of the Land Law. It is impossible to clear one's mind after just one symposium. Although this enthusiasm for rushing down to the villages to convey the message is not bad, it seems that there is some impatience. Impatience will certainly not be able to correctly convey the Land Law to the peasants, let alone correctly implement the Land Law Outline. According to reports from correspondents Lu Jinsen and others: Licheng Chengjiashan used the Land Law Outline to \"stabilize the peasants' emotions and promote winter production.\" After discussing it in the winter school, \"the next day the entire village's winter production was vigorously more enthusiastic than before.\" Poor peasant Cheng Yuquan said: \"In the past, I thought I was preparing for struggle, still waiting to share the fruits... This year, I have to work hard in production and take the lead.\" The implementation of the Land Law Outline is to rely on poor and landless peasants to overthrow the landlord class, completely divide the land, and fully satisfy the demands of poor and landless peasants. However, the village has used the Land Law as a tool to promote winter production; it's completely irrelevant. We hope that the responsible parties in Licheng will conduct an inspection and see what misunderstandings or distortions of the Land Law exist in various places, and conduct corrections and education at any time.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “这样咱们都能翻透身啦！”　贫雇农热烈拥护土地法\n\n1948-01-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“这样咱们都能翻透身啦！”\n    贫雇农热烈拥护土地法\n    【本报消息】中国共产党公布的中国土地法大纲，受到农民的热烈拥护。黎城城关的农民们说：“这样咱们都能翻透身啦！”登着土地法大纲的报纸到了黎城城关，各机关、团体、学校、商店的油灯下围满了人，有的看，看不懂的请别人念。贫农任新年说：“去年斗地主就不彻底；是干部先讨论一下，照顾地主生活。在分配上也不公道。地主的狗食比农民的饭还好，我放了十来年羊，是亲眼见到的。”中农王生才说：“地主王天章、李保元压迫了一辈子人，在年时冬天才搞出他十来亩地。银元、元宝和东西，明知道他有，他能死也不拿。秋天在他窖底下刨出四个大缸，你看地主可恨不可恨！”贫农李金德说：“过去地主富农地多，咱街二十户，就有十八户是给两家受的。你看平等不平等！以前学校机关分的地都是好地，这次平分吧，有了这些地，就差不多够补用了。”二区程家山村二百多个农民在冬学里研究土地法大纲，对于给地主分地的事，大家争论起来。雇农小锐说：“总得先满足了咱农民的要求，可以给他分一份。这是咱们农民对地主的宽大。”武安三王村的农民听干部念土地法大纲，对于“抽多补少”、“抽肥补瘦”顶满意。贫农张留堂说：“平等，平等，错这样不能均了。”\n    　　　　自己懂得了再给人解释\n    从一些消息看来，有些地方对土地法的认识和宣传还有不正确的地方。左权来稿：报纸到后四区区委会召集各系统干部座谈土地法，赵占魁同志说：“听了这篇报，可是解决了我思想问题啦！”“当日上午就接到了县委来信，召开全区村级主要干部会议，传达中央土地法大纲”，“区委会决定分三个地点，召开村支书及主要干部会议”传达。“李贵富同志因高兴的不得了，早上座谈罢，下乡走时连报纸也给拿走啦！”我们觉得：解释土地法大纲要十分谨慎、细心，应该彻底打通干部思想，整顿好队伍，建立起为雇贫服务的根本观念，才能懂得土地法真正的意思，经过一次座谈就打通了思想是不可能的，急着下到村里传达，这种热情虽然不坏，看来恐怕有些急性病。急性病一定不能正确传达土地法给农民，更不能正确的执行土地法大纲。另据通讯员路进森等人报导：黎城程家山用土地法大纲“稳定了农民情绪，推进了冬季生产”。在冬学里讨论后，“第二天全村的冬季生产都轰轰烈烈的较前起劲了。”贫农程雨宽说：“我过去心想是准备斗争，还等着分果实哩……今年可得在生产中好好干，起带头”。执行土地法大纲是为依靠贫雇农打倒地主阶级彻底平分土地，充分满足贫雇农要求，该村却把土地法当做了推动冬季生产的工具；驴头不对马嘴，希望黎城负责方面做一检查。并看看各地对土地法有什么误解或曲解，随时进行纠正和教育。"

A large number of relatives, friends, and neighbors were involved, consuming more than ten *shi* of rice and flour. He hired a music band and made paper crafts worth 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, bought sixteen or seventeen packs of cigarettes and more than thirty packs of dry tobacco.

In the past, they loaned 10,000 yuan to landlord Li Chunyu of Xuequanling, and didn't inquire about it even after six months overdue. When they went to collect the debt this time, the masses had already sealed off Li Chunyu's door. Loans to landlord Zhang Xiaocheng of Baiduo Village and landlord Li Shengqi of Xuegeta were also met with sealed doors from the masses when they went to collect. Last spring, they loaned 200,000 yuan for spring plowing to the masses of Quantou, but none of it reached the peasants; it was used by the village cooperative. The Madi Village Cooperative wrote a letter to the Credit Department introducing a village elementary school teacher for a loan and acting as guarantor. The Credit Department loaned to him without inquiring about his class background or situation. However, when hired and poor peasant Zhang Guosheng wanted to buy an ox and asked for a loan, the cooperative was afraid he couldn't repay it and dared not guarantee it. They carelessly wrote a letter of introduction saying: \"Zhang Guosheng wants a loan. If you have funds, lend him some; if not, it's up to you!\" In addition, some middle peasants, afraid of being called rich, pretended to be poor and borrowed some money, keeping it at home, and the Credit Department didn't ask about its use before lending it. From these incidents, the Credit Department was unaware of all kinds of inappropriate loans and loans to landlords. After this inspection, they recovered 1,567,300 yuan of loans issued to landlords, rich peasants, cadres, and cooperatives.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 阳城六区区联社无立场　贷款发在地主家害怕贫雇还不起\n\n1948-01-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　阳城六区区联社无立场\n    贷款发在地主家害怕贫雇还不起\n    【本报太岳五日电】阳城六区区联社信用部在县开生产会后，就和区干部下到村里检查一下自己的工作，原来有严重的官僚主义和失掉立场的事情。过去贷给雪泉岭地主李春雨一万元款，过期六个月也不问，这次上门去要，群众早已把李春雨的门封了。贷给柏朵村地主张小成和雪圪塔地主李生奇的款，这次去要，群众也把门封了。去年春天贷给劝头群众春耕款二十万元，但是都没有到了农民手里，叫村里合作社给利用了。麻地村合作社给信用部写了一封信，介绍他村小学教员贷款并作保人。信用部不问成份情况就贷给了。可是雇贫农张郭盛买了牛想贷款，合作社却害怕还不起，不敢担保。马虎的写了封介绍信说：“张郭盛想贷款，有的话贷给他一部，没款你们看吧！”另外有些中农怕人说富，假装穷贷些款，放在家里，信用部也不问用处贷给了。从这些事情看，各种各样的不该贷款和地主贷款，信用部都不知道。这一次检查后，就收回贷给地主富农干部合作社的款一百五十六万七千三百元。"

The assault team of Guo Jisheng's company from the Chen Su forces climbed over the deep trenches and high ground of Jingang Temple, broke into the north gate, and quickly occupied the commanding height of the Jingang Temple courtyard. At the same time, Zhang Yao's battalion of the Chen Xie forces, braving the intense firepower of the enemy's thirteen light machine guns, broke into Sun Village (west of Jingang Temple) in one fell swoop, compressing an enemy battalion into five courtyards. The enemy set fire to the houses in an attempt to stop the PLA's advance, and repeatedly launched desperate counterattacks, but were all beaten back by Guo Jisheng's company. Our follow-up troops poured into the breakthrough and fiercely advanced towards the main street. The enemy wavered, throwing their guns one by one outside the doors and shouting in the houses, \"We surrender!\" The remaining thousand-plus remnants fled wildly to the southwest. The soldiers of Yang's regiment from the Chen Su forces chased closely, and Zhang Feng's battalion of the Chen Xie forces, ambushed in Sun Village, greeted the fleeing Chiang bandits with dense bullets, ultimately preventing the Chiang bandits from escaping the dragnet.\n　　After the battle, the soldiers of the two great armies, covered in snowflakes, rushed up together and shook hands warmly. A soldier from the Chen Su forces said, \"Last New Year, our Central China troops and Shandong troops met, and the first battle was to annihilate the 26th Division and the 1st Rapid Column. This year, we meet with you and fought another beautiful battle.\" Then the soldiers of the Chen Xie forces asked about the Laiwu Victory and the Menglianggu Victory. A political instructor from the Chen Xie forces was recounting the scene of crossing the Yellow River.\n　　Fan, the company commander of the Chen Xie forces, insisted on giving a machine gun and thirty-odd prisoners they had just captured to the comrades of the Chen Su forces who were pursuing the Chiang bandits. The soldiers of the Chen Su forces insisted on giving a large pile of rifles to the comrades of the Chen Xie forces. Everyone yielded to each other. Instructor Yao led a pack animal and insisted on letting a wounded soldier of the Chen Su forces, Guo Yun, ride back, saying, \"We want to learn from you!\" The reply was the same voice: \"We want to learn from you!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陈粟陈谢会师情景\n季音\n1948-01-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　陈粟陈谢会师情景\n    季音\n    十二月二十五日雪夜三点半钟，在一片突然的巨大的爆响里，两路解放军开始夹攻金刚寺（西平南）蒋匪整三师第二十旅。陈粟部队郭继胜连突击队爬过了金刚寺的深沟高地突入北门，迅速占领制高点金刚寺大院。同时陈谢部队张姚营冒着敌人十三挺轻机枪的强大火网，一举突入孙庄（金刚寺西）。把敌人一个营压缩到五个院子里。敌人点燃了房子，企图阻止解放军前进，并且一次又一次的作最后挣扎性的反扑，都被郭继胜连打下去。我后续部队涌进了突破口，猛烈的向大街发展。敌人动摇了，把枪一支支的丢到门外，并在屋子里喊着：“我们缴枪啦！”其余一千多个残敌便连滚带爬的向西南狂奔，陈粟部队杨团的战士紧紧的追赶，预伏在孙庄的陈谢部队张锋营用密集的子弹迎接逃窜过来的蒋匪，终使蒋匪逃不出天罗地网。\n    两支大军的战士们在战斗结束后，披着满身雪花一齐涌上来亲密的握手。一个陈粟部队的战士说：“去年新年我们华中部队和山东部队会合，第一仗就是歼灭了二十六师和第一快连纵队。今年我们和你们会合，又打了个漂亮仗。”接着陈谢部队战士就问莱芜大捷和孟良崮大捷的经过。一个陈谢部队的指导员则在叙述抢渡黄河的情景。\n    陈谢部队范连长一定要把刚才缴的一挺机枪和三十几个俘虏送给追击蒋匪的陈粟部队的同志，陈粟部队的战士一定要把一大堆步枪送给陈谢部队同志，大家互相推让，姚教导员牵来一匹牲口，一定要一个负伤的陈粟部队郭运战士骑着回去。还说：“我们要向你们学习”，回答的却是同样一个声音：“我们要向你们学习！”"

According to comprehensive reports from various sources: American monopoly capital's economic aggression against China, with the full assistance of the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek government, is advancing rapidly. Since Zhang Kou publicly issued a formal statement in August on \"Foreign Investment and Technical Cooperation in China,\" three American companies, namely China Universal Tobacco Company, Nelson Company, and Anderson Meyer & Co., have negotiated to set up factories in China. Universal Tobacco Company plans to set up a cigarette factory and directly engage in planting and distributing tobacco; Nelson Company plans to establish a tannery and promote its products; Meyer Company plans to establish a machine factory in Shanghai to manufacture electrical, medical, and other equipment. In response, Gu Yu@, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chiang gang's National Economic Commission, in order to curry favor with his American masters, obsequiously stated: \"The committee has immediately approved this application,\" and triumphantly told a reporter from the semi-official American news agency United Press that he hoped \"foreign capitalists will abandon their doubts and accept China's (Chiang's) invitation,\" fully exposing the Chiang gang authorities' traitorous and foreign-flattering ugliness.

In the end, the things the people wanted to do, the government either couldn't do or couldn't do well. Many of the government cadres came from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds, and they had landlord and rich peasant ideas, not being of one mind with us peasants. For example, when it came to emancipation, the government didn't offer us much help.

We will establish positions for those who can do what the people need. Government cadres should act as farmhands for the people and not put on airs of authority. Government decisions should be made based on the opinions of the peasant representatives and poor and landless peasants.

The newly formed Yellow River Flood Area Refugee Relief Committee provided grain and clothing to thousands of refugees in the city and actively helped them return home to distribute land and houses and rebuild their homes. On the afternoon of the 20th of last month, a political organ of our army convened a forum for unemployed KMT military officers. More than 700 officers, from colonels to second lieutenants, attended. Most of them were \"miscellaneous troops\" or not from military academies, and some were abandoned because of injuries or disabilities sustained during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the civil war. At the meeting, they all accused the KMT bandits of their crimes. Liu Shaoquan, a demobilized lieutenant adjutant from the 38th Division, had pulled rickshaws, sold oranges, shined shoes, and wandered around Chongqing, Hankou, and Nanjing. He was imprisoned three times by the KMT government and finally deported and ended up in Luohe City as a petty thief. After the Liberation Army arrived this time, each demobilized officer received 100 bags of rice as temporary relief, and later, sufficient travel expenses were issued to those who volunteered to return home. On the first day after the liberation of Luohe, more than 200 people were subsidized to return home. Nineteen employees of the Henan Branch of the Executive Yuan did not leave Luohe, and their lives and property were protected. They had not been paid for three months and requested relief, so our army immediately issued them 2,000 catties of rice. They were deeply moved and automatically helped with the relief work. In total, our army distributed 1 million catties of rice and wheat in Luohe City, and about 50,000 people, one-third of the city's population, received relief. Countless people from the surrounding villages came upon hearing the news. On the first day after liberation, even though the enemy in Yancheng was still shelling, tens of thousands of people were crowded at the station to collect grain.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 我军解放漯河市后　五万贫民得到救济\n\n1948-01-08\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　我军解放漯河市后\n  　五万贫民得到救济\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线六日电】我军解放漯河市后，即广泛救济贫民，包括编余蒋军军官及行总分署职工。新组成的黄泛区难民救济委员会给市内数千黄泛区难民以粮食及衣物，积极帮助他们回家去分田分房，重整家园。上月二十日下午我军某政治机关曾召集了蒋军失业军官举行座谈会，到会有上校至少尉军官七百多名，他们多半因为是“杂牌”或非军校出身，有的则是在抗战和内战中因伤残废，而被撇弃。会上他们纷纷控诉蒋匪的罪恶。三十八师编余中尉副官刘少泉，拉过洋车、卖过橘子、擦过皮鞋，流浪于重庆、汉口、南京，被蒋匪政府关过三次，最后被驱逐出境而流落漯河市上作小偷。这次解放军到后，各编余军官即得到了一百包大米作为临时救济，后又按各人志愿发给充足的旅费回家。漯河解放后第一天就资助两百多人回家。行总河南分署有十九个职员没有退出漯河，他们的生命财产都得到了保护。他们已有三个月没有发薪，请求救济，我军当即发给他们两千斤大米。他们深受感动，自动帮助进行救济工作。总计我军在漯河市发放了一百万斤大米和小麦，市内三分之一的人口约五万人获得了救济。四乡人民闻讯而来的不计其数。在解放后第一天，虽然郾城敌人还在发炮，车站上领粮的人，已万头钻动，拥挤不堪。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: TASS, Moscow, 30th: Alexandrov commented today in the Labor Newspaper on the Chinese situation, stating: \"The characteristic of the latter half of 1947 is that the situation on the Chinese Civil War front has fundamentally changed. The People's Liberation Army has been carrying out a counter-offensive for six months. The main purpose of the counter-offensive is to inflict heavy blows on the Kuomintang army's main strategic positions in the Jiangbei provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Hubei, seize and destroy railway transportation in this area, and isolate the Kuomintang army in North China and Southern Manchuria, cutting off their connection with the central part of the Kuomintang, thus placing the Kuomintang in an inevitable defeat. The People's Liberation Army has now successfully carried out the offensive according to this purpose. The People's Liberation Army has achieved such a victory: first of all, because the democratic army of the Chinese Liberated Areas has organized and consolidated the rear defense, it has been able to launch a counter-offensive and annihilate a large number of Kuomintang troops trained and equipped by American imperialists. After Japan surrendered, the American command trained and equipped more than sixty divisions of the Kuomintang with modern weapons, used American transportation to transport these divisions to North China and Southern Manchuria, and handed over part of their air force and a large number of 'surplus combat materials' to the Kuomintang. These seemingly powerful armed forces constantly attacked the Liberated Areas during the first year of the civil war, and the Liberated Areas were forced to adopt a defensive posture; at the same time, they accumulated strength to prepare for a counter-offensive. From July 1, 1946, to July 1, 1947, in twelve months, the People's Liberation Army carried out mobile warfare, systematically annihilating the living forces of the counter-revolution and seizing its technical equipment. In the latter half of 1947, the People's Liberation Army had annihilated nearly half of Chiang Kai-shek's well-trained and well-equipped 'elite' troops, and was able to launch a full-scale counter-offensive against the Kuomintang reactionaries. The People's Liberation Army not only successfully launched a counter-offensive, but also implemented important democratic reforms. This reform not only benefited the people of the Liberated Areas, but also greatly attracted the masses of people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, especially peasants and urban poor. In the course of a year, tens of millions of peasants in the Liberated Areas acquired land formerly belonging to the Japanese, reactionary landlords, and traitors. The Chinese Communist Party has now promulgated a new 'Outline Land Law of China,' stipulating that all land will be equally divided by the rural people. This reform and other reforms have attracted millions of peasants in the areas reached by the People's Liberation Army's offensive into the ranks of the People's Liberation Army, and tens of millions of peasants in the rear of the Kuomintang have also launched armed uprisings to resist the Kuomintang army and the Kuomintang regime. These reforms have caused the morale of the Kuomintang, which is mainly composed of peasants, to decline. Because the new land reform stipulates that if Kuomintang officers and soldiers join the People's Liberation Army, their families and even themselves can be given land, hundreds of thousands of Kuomintang officers and soldiers would rather be captured by the Liberation Army. In the great victory of the Liberation Army's offensive, the political and economic collapse of the American running dog Kuomintang regime and its approaching final failure have become very clear in the minds of the vast majority of the Chinese people.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 我实行反攻与土地改革　蒋家政权接近最后失败  苏劳动报论中国情势  中国土地法大纲　吸引数百万农民进入解放军使数十万蒋军宁愿作俘虏\n\n1948-01-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　我实行反攻与土地改革\n  　蒋家政权接近最后失败\n    苏劳动报论中国情势\n    中国土地法大纲\n  　吸引数百万农民进入解放军使数十万蒋军宁愿作俘虏\n    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社莫斯科三十日电：亚历山大罗夫今日于劳动报著文评述中国情势称：一九四七年后半年的特点，就是中国内战战线上情势已根本改观。人民解放军已进行了六个月反攻。反攻之主要目的即在予苏皖豫鄂的江北各省国民党军主要战略阵地以沉重打击，夺取与破坏这一地区的铁路交通，并孤立华北与南满的国民党军，切断其与国民党中央部分的联系，这样置国民党于必败之地。人民解放军现在已经按照这一目的顺利地进行了攻势。人民解放军所以获得这样的胜利：首先是由于中国解放区人民的民主军已经组织与巩固了后方防御，因此能够发动反攻，歼灭大量由美国帝国主义者训练与装备的国民党军队。日本投降后，美国司令部就以现代的武器给国民党训练与装备了六十多个师，利用美国运输工具把这些师运到华北与南满去，并把他们一部分的空军与大量的“剩余作战物资”交给国民党。这些看来似乎强有力的武装部队，内战第一年中曾不断地进攻解放区，解放区则被迫采取守势；同时蓄集力量准备反攻。由一九四六年七月一日到一九四七年七月一日十二个月中，人民解放军进行了运动战，有系统地歼灭反革命的有生力量，夺取其技术装备。一九四七年后半年中，人民解放军既已歼灭了近半数训练与装备良好的蒋介石的“精锐”部队，遂能对国民党反动派的军队发动全面反攻。人民解放军不仅胜利地发动了反攻，而且还实行了重要的民主改革。这种改革不仅使解放区人民受到裨益，而且还大大吸引了国民党统治区人民群众，特别是农民和城市贫民。在一年的过程中，解放区数千万农民获得了以前属于日本人、反动地主和汉奸的土地。中国共产党现在又公布了新的“中国土地法大纲”，规定一切土地概由农村人民平分。这种改革和其他改革已经将解放军攻势所及的地区的数百万农民吸引进人民解放军的阵营，国民党后方的成千万的农民也纷纷武装起义，反抗国民党军和国民党政权。这些改革已使主要由农民组成的国民党的士气日渐低落。由于新土地改革规定国民党的官兵如果参加人民解放军，其家属甚至本人也可分得土地，数十万的国民党官兵就宁愿为解放军俘虏。在解放军攻势的大胜利中，美国走狗国民党政权的政治与经济崩溃及日益接近最后失败，在绝大多数中国人民心目中，已变得十分清楚了。"

    "author": "Feng Yinhen",
    "date": "1948-01-08",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "My Reflection\n\n　　Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, my family was a landlord family. However, after joining the revolution, I was unwilling to reveal my true identity. Therefore, on the cadre appraisal form and personnel statistics form, I always lowered my own status to that of a rich or middle peasant. During the War of Resistance, my family was devastated by the enemy, puppets, and die-hards, and my landlord status declined. I was very happy about this situation, trying to play both sides, feeling lucky. When the landlord class could exist, I was a landlord; when the landlord class was unlucky, I became a poor person! Therefore, during the \"Three Check-Ups\" campaign, I was numb and indifferent. I thought my family had never been traitors or oppressed anyone, and we weren't part of the ruling class. Economically, we had already been ruined, so there was nothing to investigate. Then I thought, what if the masses are asked whether they hate your family? Or what did you eat growing up? No problem; those from landlord families grew up eating the food of exploitation, and the masses will definitely have opinions about those who ate the food of exploitation. If the masses forgive you, that is a great favor to you, and you should thank them. You shouldn't take it for granted. You should reflect on your landlord ideology, get rid of it, and work more diligently for the people, making amends for your crimes. Only when I thought of this did I realize that being afraid of losing face and unwilling to admit having landlord ideology is like building \"air-raid shelters\" for the enemy (in your mind), preparing to attack the revolution again when the opportunity arises.\n\n　　Anyone from a landlord background is bound to have landlord ideology. Coming to the revolutionary ranks makes you an unforgivable enemy. How can you do without investigation? I began to realize that investigation was necessary. I discovered my own enemy and presented him to everyone. After several discussions and studies, a fitting charge was determined: the decadent ideology of the landlord class. Everyone unanimously demanded that I eliminate it, but I still felt attached and unconvinced. After more than ten days, I finally understood. The decadent ideology of the ruined landlord class manifests in work as passivity, initial enthusiasm followed by laxity, the idea of \"equal shares\" in revolutionary benefits, lack of ambition, and anti-leadership thoughts. My passive work performance is: revolutionary work never gets done, but I'm always working every day, procrastinating and comparing myself to others, always feeling that I do more, that I'm too \"honest,\" always feeling that others are deceiving me and that I'm too foolish. When the environment was bad and I was asked to go to enemy-occupied areas to collect grain, I thought they were sending me to be captured by the enemy. This was because I was too honest and capable, so I should be more careful and cunning in the future.\n\n　　My initial enthusiasm followed by laxity in work was because I was eager to improve my position. Once I achieved it or tasted bitterness, I would think, what's the point? It would be more interesting to slack off a little and play the erhu for entertainment. I always felt that being neither too active nor too backward was the most suitable state. I had the idea of \"equal shares\" in revolutionary benefits. I once secretly took 10,000 yuan from the public funds to use for my family's business. At that time, I thought, I've been in the revolution for so many years, and my family hasn't used a single cent of public funds or eaten a single meal paid for by public funds. What's wrong with using a little bit of public money? I've been running around all these years, is it only worth 10,000 yuan? If I were a hired worker, I would have been given tens of thousands of yuan for living expenses each year. Look, others who participate in the revolution have their entire families supported by the public, receiving more benefits than I do. So what's wrong with me taking a little bit? After years of work, I should have an appropriate position. Others are promoted, but I'm treated unfairly. For several years, I've been working hard and shedding blood for the revolution. I haven't been sitting at home as an ordinary citizen. I only emphasize my own merits and don't reflect on my work and my prestige among the masses. I simply demand a position from the higher authorities, thinking that I'm not responsible for my work because my position is not high enough. If I'm not in that position, I won't concern myself with its affairs. I don't actively offer suggestions and watch the jokes from the sidelines, indulging in liberalism, calling myself a \"jack-of-all-trades\" cadre, spreading irresponsible remarks. My work is passive and decadent, making some passive comrades even more passive and dragging down some active ones. I also don't trust the higher authorities, complaining that they don't have a sense of position. They have a position and no personal interests because their personal interests are satisfied, so they tell their subordinates to work honestly for them, maintaining their position. Once, Bureau Chief Zhang said, \"Let's think back to a few years ago, we were all children. Now we've grown up, who raised us? Wasn't it the revolution that fed us?\" I thought to myself, there's no need to say that. The revolution raised us, but I also contributed to the revolution. If there wasn't the strength of us children, would the revolution be so great? There's no need to say all this, I know, no one owes anyone anything. I don't think about how we can unite further and work harder to do a better job, why should we worry about personal gains and losses? Thinking this way, the higher authorities are completely right. But at the time, I just couldn't think that way.\n\n　　Precisely because I haven't gotten rid of the decadent ideology of the ruined landlord class, I've never worked honestly. I'm always worried about gains and losses, considering my own problems. Sometimes I think about working in a bookstore, but I feel that other jobs are too hard. Working in a bookstore makes it easier to get to a big city, and waiting for later enjoyment isn't bad. So I think I should muddle through my work. I deliberately complain to the higher authorities, demand a position, and desire to enjoy a comfortable life. This is my preliminary reflection. (Reprinted from \"Workers' Life\" of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region)\n\n　　Comrade Feng Yinhen's reflection is like taking a self-portrait, revealing his true face. As he himself said, he is worried about gains and losses, only concerned with personal matters, and always passive towards the revolution and work. What is lacking here is a better understanding of what influence his landlord class origin has had on him. Does he still have some attachment to this class? Is he rebelling against it to serve the people wholeheartedly, or is he clinging to it, continuing to hold a \"share\" in the revolutionary ranks? If he is determined to rebel, then what was his attitude towards the people in the past? What should it be in the future? He can find a path. Comrade Feng has not been able to forcefully criticize the dirty things he has reflected upon because this line has not been clearly drawn. We hope he will continue to reflect and continue to write about the situation of his reflections.\n　　——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 我的反省\n冯隐痕\n1948-01-08\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　我的反省\n    我家里在抗战前是一个地主家庭，可是参加革命后我不愿暴露真面目，所以干部鉴定表上及人员统计表上总把我自己降低到富农中农成份。在抗战当中家庭因为受敌伪顽的摧残，地主成份是破落了，这样情况自己满高兴，两头赶，真侥幸，地主能存在的时候是地主，地主倒霉的时候变成穷人啦！所以在三查的时候自己麻木不仁，我认为家里没当过汉奸，没欺压过人，并非统治人物，在经济方面早已摧毁，没有可查的地方。我又一想，如果要问群众对你家里有没有仇恨？问你吃什么饭长大的？没问题；地主出身的就是吃剥削饭长大的，吃剥削饭长大的群众对你就不会没意见。假若群众对你原谅，那对你是一个莫大的恩施，应当感谢群众才对。不应当处之泰然，应该是追想自己的地主思想，把它去掉好更尽心的来为人民办事，戴罪立功才是。想到这里才认识到，怕丢人的不愿说自己有地主思想，那就等于给敌人（在思想）造“防空洞”，准备有机会再向革命进攻。\n    只要是地主出身就一定带有地主思想，到革命阵营来这是不可饶恕的敌人，不查怎会行呢？我开始觉悟到不查不行。我自己发现我的敌人，把敌人摆在大家面前，经过几次的讨论、研究，定了个恰当的罪名，地主的颓废思想，大家一致的要求我将它消灭，可是我还有留恋不服气，经过十来天的工夫，才弄清楚了。破落地主的颓废思想，在工作的表现是消极、前紧后松，革命利益均占的入股思想，不求进取与反上思想。我消极工作的表现是：革命工作做不完，工作还是天天干，歇会推会，常与别人相比，总觉着自己做的多，太“老实”，总觉着别人欺骗自己，自己太傻气。环境不好的时候要我到敌占区催粮，我以为叫我到敌人据点里去做俘虏，这是因为自己太老实太能干了，所以今后应当小心一点，更滑一点。\n    我工作上的前紧后松，紧是为了换取自己的地位，换到了，或者尝到苦头了，又想何必呢？少干一点拉拉胡琴消遣一些到也怪有兴趣。我老觉着积极和落后都不好，只有做中间状态的人才合适。我有革命利益均占的想法，我曾经偷支公家一万元，给我家庭做买卖，那时就这样想，我革命多少年啦，我的家庭没用公家分文，没吃公家一顿饭，用公家这点钱还算什么？我这些年来东奔西跑，就值这一万元吗，我当一个雇工那一年也得给几万元的生活费，看：别人的革命，公家有的养他全家，比我可得的利益多啦，就这一点我有什么不应该呢？多年的工作，该有我适当的地位，别人的地位上升，惟我薄待。几年来的革命，我也是拼命流血的干着，我也并非在家当老百姓。光强调自己的功劳，而不回想自己的工作及在群众中的威信。单纯的向上级要求地位，认为自己地位不高，所以对工作也不负责任。不在其位不谋其政，应管的事不管，也不积极提意见，旁观看笑话，犯自由主义，说自己是万金油干部，散布一些不负责任的话。工作消极颓废。使一些消极的同志更消极，把一些积极的也拉了腿。我还不相信上级，抱怨上级，说上级没地位观念，是他有地位啦，他没个人利益，是他个人利益满足啦，所以才叫下级老实着干，这干是为他个人干，以此来维系他的地位。有一次张局长曾经这样讲：“咱们回想几年前，咱们都是小孩子，现在咱长大了是谁把咱养大了，还不是吃革命饭长大的？”我自已想不用这样说，革命把咱养大了，可是我也给革命出力啦，假使没有俺这个小孩子的力气，革命就会这样大吗。不用说这一些，我是知道的，谁也不欠谁情。而不去想咱们再更团结一步，再努一把力，把工作做的更好，何必计较个人的得失。这样想来，那上级完全是对的了。可是当时偏不能这样想。\n    正是因为我破落地主的颓废思想没去掉，所以始终没有老老实实的干过工作，经常的是患得患失考虑自己的问题，有时想出书店，又觉其他工作生活太苦，书店工作容易进大城市，等待后来的享受还不错。所以心里想敷衍着工作吧。故意的向上级发牢骚，要地位，愿享受一些舒适的生活。这算是我一个初步的反省吧。（转载冀鲁豫职工生活）    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    冯隐痕同志这段反省，是自己给自己照了一张像，这张像把自己的真面目照出来了，正如他自己说的，患得患失，只替个人打算，对革命，对工作总是消极的。这里缺乏的是还没有很好认识一下自己出身的地主阶级给了自己一些什么影响？自己对这个阶级是不是还有一些留恋？叛变他全心为人民服务呢？还是依恋他继续在革命队伍均一个“股份”呢？如果决心叛变的话，那么自己对人民的态度过去如何？今后应该如何？就可以找到一条道路。冯同志没有能把自己反省出的脏东西加以有力的批判，就是因为这个界限没划清楚。我们希望继续反省，并把反省的情况继续写来。　　——编者"

    "content": "Reorganize Government Ranks, Implement Equal Land Distribution\n  　Border Region Government Formally Reorganized\n    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Border Region Government was formally reorganized on the morning of the 5th of this month. At the reorganization meeting, Chairman Yang, with a spirit of self-criticism, conducted a rigorous examination of the government's work and briefly explained the significance of the reorganization. It is to adapt to the new situation of implementing land reform, serving the peasants in the border region, and adapting to the victorious development of the patriotic self-defense war, to more effectively support the front lines. Therefore, it is necessary to rectify the government ranks, change the organization, and transform the work style. Among the government personnel, cadres from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds account for a large proportion. Their class viewpoints are not clear, and landlord and rich peasant ideology and bureaucratic work styles seriously exist. They have not been good \"long-term workers\" for the people of the border region. Secondly, the organizational structure of our government is not suitable for the New Democracy, but rather inherits the old ways of the Kuomintang government, which is neither suitable for the patriotic self-defense war nor for the needs of our work. Today, this old set of organizations must be reorganized, and certain personnel must be adjusted. However, today's reorganization is only the first step in streamlining the government organization. It is from top to bottom, not from bottom to top through the review of workers and peasants in the border region; therefore, it is preliminary, transitional, and temporary. Chairman Yang said that the methods and spirit of the reorganization are: (1) To strengthen financial and economic work, the Joint Military-Political Financial Office, which was necessary to establish in the past and has achieved results, will be merged with the Border Region Government to strengthen its power. Because the poor and lower-middle peasants have just turned themselves around after land reform, and there are still many difficulties that need to be greatly helped to solve, and their burdens cannot be increased. But we must also launch a major counter-offensive and fight major battles, which consumes a lot, which requires us to do a good job in financial and economic work. Overcome any departmentalism, corruption, and waste, and consider every bit for supporting the front lines and serving the masses. Therefore, this year, in addition to land reform, financial and economic construction, especially the development of production, is the central task of the government, which is the basic direction of combining land reform, serving the poor and hired, and consolidating the results of land reform. (2) The organizational structure must firmly grasp the principle of streamlining personnel, setting up positions according to tasks, not setting up positions according to people. Work should be divided into urgent and slow, and we will do whatever the masses need. Whatever organs are needed for work, we will set up those organs. The old organization that has been inherited from the Kuomintang government for a long time must be broken, and the bureaucratic work style that is high above and does not understand the suffering of the masses must be eradicated. Now, according to the economic development of our region and the urgent demands of the peasants, this government needs to re-establish the following institutions, namely seven departments of Finance, Cooperation, Industry, Trade, Transportation, Education, and Audit and Inspection, one Secretariat, the Public Security Bureau, and the Jinnan Bank. The directly affiliated agencies are the Border Region Postal Administration, the Health Bureau, the Trade Corporation, the Industrial Research Institute, and the Opium Suppression Bureau. (3) In the use of cadres, in addition to considering work needs and their work ability, in the past, more attention was paid to cultural level and work ability, and insufficient attention was paid to the training, promotion, and bold use of cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds, which is not right. In the future, we must pay attention to the composition and quality of cadres. Each department must not use personnel indiscriminately, and would rather have vacancies than disorder. Sometimes, for the sake of work, cadres should even be demoted to use, so that one person can do the work of one or even two people, improving work efficiency. In the past, there were too many levels in the government, and some departments had commanders but few soldiers, which was not good for leadership. This problem needs to be resolutely overcome.\n    Regarding the leadership issue after the reorganization of the Border Region Government, Chairman Yang especially emphasized promoting the spirit of democracy and centralism. (1) The chairman and vice-chairmen should lead collectively, and appropriately divide the work on the basis of collective leadership, so as to overcome the past phenomenon of each taking care of their own affairs. The entire leadership should be exercised through the Political Affairs Conference. This conference should be composed of the chairman and vice-chairmen, the directors and deputy directors of the departments, the secretary-general and deputy secretary-general, the director and deputy director of the Public Security Bureau, and the general manager and deputy general manager of the bank; relevant departments may attend. Before the establishment of the Border Region Peasants' Representative Conference, this conference needs to respect and listen to the opinions of the preparatory committee of the Border Region Peasants' Representative Conference, and listen to the opinions of poor peasants, farm laborers, and workers, so as to improve the work. (2) Each department should establish a certain working conference system, and important issues must be discussed through meetings to promote the enthusiasm of each person. This meeting system must be adhered to and implemented, and must not be optional. (3) Establish a joint office (collective office) system, but it must not be reduced to formalism. Each person should work at least eight hours a day to break the lax phenomenon of \"eating one's fill and doing nothing.\" Here, Chairman Yang called on all government personnel to continue the Three Check-Ups study, thoroughly overcome landlord and rich peasant ideology and bureaucracy, establish the idea of serving the poor and hired peasants and workers, and wholeheartedly and conscientiously be long-term workers for the people. Sitting and eating the people's millet is a criminal act.\n    Finally, Chairman Yang announced the list of personnel after the reorganization of the Border Region Government and the powers of each department: Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Border Region Government, Zhang Youyu, and Rong Wusheng, Vice-Chairmen, are responsible for the overall leadership. Rong Wusheng, concurrently Vice-Chairman and Director of the Finance Department, is responsible for food, finance, taxation, war service, drafting budgets, and managing the treasury and public property. Yang Xiufeng, concurrently Chairman and Director of the Cooperation Department, is responsible for cooperative undertakings, water conservancy, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and mass sideline occupations. Xu Daben, Director of the Industry Department, and Lai Jifa, Deputy Director, are responsible for the military industry, the industrial and mining industries operated by the Border Region Government and various administrative offices, and the guidance and management of private industries. Lin Haiyun, Director of the Trade Department, is responsible for import and export management, import and export tax collection, monopoly of tobacco, alcohol, and salt and their taxes, and guidance and management of trade organs at all levels and private trade. Wu Jingtian, Director of the Transportation Department, and Zhang Wen'ang, Deputy Director, are responsible for railways, highways, roads, postal services, telecommunications, public transportation in the border region, and the guidance and management of people's transportation undertakings. Chao Zhefu, Director of the Education Department, is responsible for cultural education and childcare. Zhou Yucheng, Director of the Audit and Inspection Department, and Huang Songling, Deputy Director, are responsible for inspecting the revenue and expenditure of finance and banks, and the operations of various public enterprises; reviewing the annual budget and final accounts and all major extra-budgetary expenditures. When a certain use of funds is found to be inappropriate, they have the right to stop its use or suspend its work. Zhang Youyu, concurrently Vice-Chairman and Secretary-General, is responsible for documents, confidentiality, general affairs, retired soldiers and preferential treatment of soldiers, health, personnel transfers, investigation and research, and communication. Hu Jingsheng and Chen Xiyu, General Manager and Deputy General Manager of the Border Region Bank (Jinnan Bank), are responsible for managing issuance, loans, foreign exchange, banks at all levels, and their directly operated paper mills and printing plants. Bu Shengguang, Director of the Public Security Bureau, and Xu Qiwen, Deputy Director, are responsible for public security affairs. Bu Shengguang, concurrently Director of the Opium Suppression Bureau, and Yu Manyun, Deputy Director, are responsible for strictly prohibiting opium and drugs, and crushing the enemy's drug policy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 整顿政府队伍贯彻平分土地　边区政府正式改组\n\n1948-01-08\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　整顿政府队伍贯彻平分土地\n  　边区政府正式改组\n    【本报讯】边区政府于本月五日上午，正式改组。在改组会上，杨主席以自我批评精神，把政府工作做了严格的检查，并扼要说明改组意义，是为适合贯彻土地改革、服务边区农民与适应爱国自卫战争胜利开展的新形势，更有力的支援前线。因而必须整顿政府的队伍，改变组织，改造作风。在政府人员当中，地主、富农出身干部，占得比例数很大，阶级观点不明确，严重存在着地主、富农思想和官僚主义作风，没有做到当边区人民的好长工。其次，我们政府的组织机构，也不是适合于新民主主义的，而是因袭了国民党政府的老一套，既不适合于爱国自卫战争，也不适合于我们工作的需要。今天必需把这老一套组织改组，某些人员必须加以调整。不过今天的改组，只是整编政府组织的第一步，是自上而下的，还不是自下而上经过边区工人、农民群众审查过的；因此是初步的、过渡的和暂时的。改组的办法和精神，杨主席说：（一）为加强财经工作，把过去有必要设立并有成绩的军政联合财经办事处和边区政府合并起来，以加强力量。因为土地改革后，贫雇农群众刚刚翻过身，还有许多困难，需要大力帮助解决，更不能加重他们的负担。但我们还要大反攻，打大仗，消耗很大，这就要求我们把财经工作努力搞好。克服任何本位、贪污浪费现象，一点一滴都为支援前线与服务群众打算。因而今年除土地改革外，财经建设特别是发展生产工作是政府的中心工作，也即是结合土地改革，服务贫雇，巩固土地改革成果的基本方向。（二）组织机构要切实掌握精干原则，因事设人，不因人设事，工作要分别急缓，群众需要什么，我们就做什么。工作需要，设什么机关就设什么机关，长期因袭国民党政府的那套旧组织，必须打破，高高在上，不了解群众痛苦的官僚主义作风，必须铲除。现在根据我区经济情况的发展和农民的迫切要求，本府需要重新设立下列机构，即财政、合作、工业、贸易、交通、教育、审检七个厅，一个秘书处、公安总局、冀南银行。直属机关设有边区邮政总局，卫生局，贸易总公司，工业研究所、禁烟总局。（三）在干部使用上，除根据工作需要及其工作能力外，过去多注意文化水平，工作能力，而对工农出身干部的培养、提拔和大胆使用注意得太差，这是不对的。今后要讲究干部的成份和品质。各个部门，不能随便乱用人员，宁缺勿乱。有时为了工作，干部还要降级使用，做到一个人顶一个，甚至顶两个，提高工作效率。过去政府里等级太多，某些部门有司令而兵很少的现象，不好领导，这个毛病需要坚决克服。\n    关于边府改组后的领导问题，杨主席特别强调发扬民主与集中的精神。（一）正副主席集体领导，在集体领导的基础上适当的分工，以克服过去的各顾各现象。整个领导，通过政务会议。这个会议，由正副主席、正副厅长、正副秘书长、公安总局正副局长、银行正副总经理组成；有关部门，可以列席参加。这个会议，在边区农民代表大会成立前，需要尊重与倾听边区农代会筹备委员会的意见，倾听贫农雇农工人的意见，以改进工作。（二）各部门要建立一定的工作会议制度，重要问题，必须经过会议讨论，发扬每个人的积极性。这种会议制度，要坚持贯彻，不得可有可无。（三）建立联合办公（集体办公）制度，但要不流于形式主义，每人每天最少做八小时工作，打破“饱食终日、无所用心”的松弛现象。在这里，杨主席号召所有政府人员，继续三查学习，彻底克服地主富农思想与官僚主义，树立为贫雇农民、工人服务思想，全心全意，兢兢业业为人民当长工。坐吃人民的小米，是一种犯罪行为。\n    最后，杨主席宣布此次边府改组后的人员名单及各部门的职权：边府主席杨秀峰，副主席张友渔、戎伍胜，负责整个领导工作。财政厅厅长戎副主席兼，负责粮食、财政、税收、战勤，起草预算，掌管金库及公产管理。合作厅厅长杨主席兼，负责合作事业、水利、农林、畜牧、群众副业。工业厅厅长徐达本，副厅长赖际发，负责军工、边府和各行署经营的工矿业及民营工业的指导管理。贸易厅厅长林海云，负责出入口管理，出入口税收征收，烟酒、盐专卖及其税收，各级贸易机关及私人贸易指导管理。交通厅厅长武竞天，副厅长张文昂，负责铁路、公路、道路、邮政、电讯、边区公营运输事业、人民交通运输事业的指导管理。教育厅厅长晁哲甫，负责文化教育、儿童保育。审检厅厅长周玉成，副厅长黄松龄，负责检查财政、银行收支发行往来及各公营企业状况；审核全年预决算及一切预算外的较大项开支。发现某种用款开支不当时，并有权停止其使用或暂停其工作。秘书长张副主席兼，负责文书、机要、总务、荣退军人及优军、卫生、人事调动、调查研究、交际等工作。边区银行（冀南银行）正副总经理胡景生、陈希愈，负责管理发行、贷款、外汇，各级银行及其直接经营的纸厂、印刷厂。公安总局正副局长卜盛光、徐启文，负责公安事宜。禁烟总局局长卜盛光兼，副局长余漫云，负责厉行禁烟禁毒，粉碎敌人的毒化政策。"

    "content": "Reader's Letters\n\n　　Checking \"Kelikong\" Comrade Editor:\n    In the news \"Changzhi Summarizes One Year of Production Experience\" published on page two on the 29th of last month, there is a section about the Changzhi Xinhua Paper Mill \"transforming tools, saving 4,500 labor days, increasing production by one time...\", according to comrades familiar with the factory's situation: this news does not conform to the facts. In the past, the factory used livestock to pull the raw materials for grinding. In June, it was changed to using electricity. The speed was increased. One electric mill (including the electricity used for the beater) can top the production volume of twelve livestock, but the electricity cost is equal to the consumption of twenty-four livestock. That is to say: after the tools were transformed (from animal power to electricity), the cost of power for grinding raw materials was more than double the cost of using livestock, greatly affecting the cost of paper. Therefore, the factory is recently planning to abandon electricity and still use livestock. This is the true situation of \"tool transformation\". As for the matter of \"saving 4,500 labor days\", I don't know what it is based on? Regarding the issue of \"increasing production by one time\", it is understood that the factory was small last year, with four pools, and this year it has been expanded to ten. The number of pools has increased, and the number of workers has also increased. Of course, the output will also increase, but this can only be said that the factory has expanded, and it cannot be said that production has increased. The factory's output is relatively low compared to general paper mills. For example, the standard daily output per worker in Zhangyuan Paper Mill is six districts of double-sided printing paper, and the actual output can be seven districts. The standard volume of a large paper mill, People's Paper Mill, is five districts, and the actual output exceeds this number. However, the standard output of this factory is only four to four and a half districts, which is much lower than others. In terms of quality, it is also far behind others. However, the wages of the factory's workers are higher than the wages of any other paper mill. (Reader Zheng Yan, Fu Hong) This manuscript was submitted by the Taihang Branch.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: According to consolidated Shanghai press reports: In the past year, the people's armed forces in Guangdong Province have achieved great development, with the number of personnel increasing from more than 20,000 to over 70,000, and the area of activity expanding from more than 30 counties to more than 60 counties, accounting for more than half of the total number of counties in the province. In some areas, the situation has been formed where the people's armed forces control the countryside, surrounding Chiang Kai-shek's isolated strongholds, and land distribution movements have begun. Their distribution can be roughly divided into six regions:\n\n(1) Southern Route: The area stretching from the border between Vietnam, Guangdong, and Guangxi in the west to Yangchunjiang, eight hundred miles to the east, is entirely under the control of the people's armed forces. The people's armed forces have two columns, each with three divisions. The base area of one column is in the area of Hepu, Lingshan, Qin County, and Fangcheng in the Shiwandashan (Ten Thousand Great Mountains) area, and has now expanded to more than 30,000 people. In May and June of last year, the uprising of more than 1,000 farmers led by Liu Zhenxia joined, and since then the momentum has grown and the development has accelerated. This unit revolted in Guangpo and Fusha towns in Fangcheng County, captured Dongxing in one fell swoop, opened granaries to relieve the poor, and promoted opposition to the \"three requisitions\" (referring to \"conscription,\" \"grain requisition,\" and \"real property requisition\"). This column has now occupied all the rural areas and towns of the above counties. Many students from large and medium-sized schools from far and near have joined this unit. Another column is led by Zhang Shichong, with its base in the plains of the Leizhou Peninsula, echoing the People's Liberation Army of Hainan Island across the water, and connected by land with the people's armed forces of He, Heng, and other counties in the Gouluo Mountains of Guangxi and the Liu Zhenxia's unit in Shiwandashan in the northwest. By the end of October, the strength of this column had grown to nearly 10,000, and it possessed a large number of water and land transport brigades composed of ships and mules and horses, traveling between the base areas. At present, the entire peninsula, from Xu Kai County on the opposite shore of Hainan Island in the south to Lianjiang in the north and Huazhou and Wuchuan in the east, except for the county towns and nine townships, has been liberated or controlled by the people's armed forces, and Xuwen County has also been liberated; Maoming, Dianbai, Yangchun, and Yangjiang in the east have become guerrilla areas. A large number of educated youths have also joined this unit. The local masses actively help their own army, serving as guides in battles against Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, launching surprise attacks against the enemy, causing Chiang Kai-shek's newspapers to lament: \"The authorities' troubles are not only due to insufficient troops, but also because the common people have all been 'banditized'.\" At present, the only Chiang Kai-shek's bandits opposing the tens of thousands of people's armed forces in the Southern Route are the two regiments of the police and security team led by Chen Pei, the director of the provincial police and security department. Since Chen established the so-called \"Guangdong-Guangxi Southern District Bandit Suppression Command\" on October 10, he has always wandered around Maoming and Xinyi, daring not to move forward.\n\n(2) The People's Liberation Army of Hainan Island has now occupied three-quarters of the island, liberating 2.5 million people. In addition to occupying villages and towns and the county towns of Baisha, Ledong, and Baoting, it has recently captured the county town of Anding and the northeastern seaport of Qinglan Port. Under the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops are shrinking in Qiongzhou, daring not to come out. Chiang Kai-shek has recently reinforced two security corps, but the number of people is less than 2,000, attempting to struggle desperately.\n\n(3) The \"Gan-Yue-Xiang Border Region Headquarters,\" based in Dayuling, leads a division of the \"People's Liberation Army Northern Route Column,\" operating in Nanxiong, Shixing, Renhua, Lechang, Wengyuan, Longnan (Jiangxi), Xinfeng and surrounding areas. In Nanxiong County alone, there are more than 1,000 people. The villages in each county are controlled by the people's armed forces. Six people's district governments and several township governments have been established in Nanxiong, and the masses have been mobilized to carry out land and grain distribution movements. Military-civilian cooperation has been widely carried out to harass Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. Nanxiong and Shixing, the hometown of Zhang Fakui, the former director of Chiang Kai-shek's Guangzhou headquarters, have been isolated from the outside world and become isolated islands. On November 18, the people's armed forces destroyed the Dakengkou railway bridge between Yingde and Qujiang on the American-aided Chiang Kai-shek supply line, the Yuehan Railway, and cut off the military transportation on the Beijiang River north of Yingde, while protecting merchant ships and implementing trade management to protect industry and commerce.\n\n(4) In the East River area, the people's armed forces have recently mobilized armed peasants everywhere in Haifeng, Lufeng, Huiyang, Zijin, Boluo, and the five counties north of them, Wuhua, Longchuan, Heyuan, Longmen, and Conghua. On October 26, more than 300 people from the people's armed forces attacked the Jiang bandits' checkpoints at Luofang, Muhu, and Yangguling, at the border between Hong Kong and Guangdong, killing and wounding 10 enemies, capturing 1 machine gun and 5 rifles, and distributing the 67 slogans issued by the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army on Double Ten Day and other leaflets. On October 18, they also destroyed the Chiang bandits' Guihai ship, forcing the Hong Kong-Guangzhou shipping line to stop for a while. In addition, a part of the people's armed forces is also active in the Pearl River Delta.\n\n(5) The people's armed forces in the Guangdong-Fujian-Jiangxi border area, led by Luo Guanquiao and Lai Fuyuan, have more than 2,000 people in the \"Guangdong-Fujian-Jiangxi Border Area People's Volunteer Corps,\" and more than 1,000 people in the Liang Ren and Zhang Naixin's unit, operating in Raoping, Dabu, Jiaoling, Pingyuan, Meixian, Heping, and Wuping in Fujian Province, and Xunwu in Jiangxi Province. Liang and Zhang's units have repeatedly defeated Chiang Kai-shek's bandit \"suppression\" troops and captured towns such as Guantang, Xintang, and Tiancun. On October 21, they also attacked the county town of Dabu.\n\n(6) The people's armed forces in the West River area include the \"People's Volunteer Army\" Gao Yao You, Deng Wu unit, the \"Democratic Allied Army\" Feng Chao, Chen Zhonggao unit and Xie Guanghan unit, totaling more than 2,000 people, operating in Kaiping, Guangning and other counties.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: According to consolidated Chiang Kai-shek-controlled area newspaper reports: By the end of last year, the people's armed forces in Guangxi had expanded to 39 counties and mobilized and organized peasants and attacked county towns everywhere. The Democratic Alliance Revolutionary Army in the Rongjiang River basin in the southwest, including Rong County, Teng County, Beiliu, and Lingxi, has established the \"Democratic Allied Army Independent 10th Division,\" led by Huang Shixian and Li Da. This unit revolted in March of last year, when it attacked Rong County and once occupied Teng County, creating the \"Teng Rong Incident\" that shocked the enemy. It has now joined forces with Zhang Shichong's column of the people's armed forces in the Leizhou Peninsula of Guangdong, with the Gouluo Mountains as its base area. In Luchuan, Bobai, Yulin and other counties, a part of the people's armed forces led by Zou Zheng has established the \"Huabei Military Region Headquarters\" and once attacked Yulin County. The unit led by Mo Fanfan in Guixian, Hengxian and Yongchun in the Yujiang River Basin is particularly strong. The one who attacked Guixian and Hengxian a month ago was the unit. At present, all the villages and towns in the area have been controlled by this unit. On both sides of the Lijiang River at the northern foot of Shiwandashan, Nanning, Funan, Shangsi, Suilu, Chongshan, Sile, Yangli, Longming and other counties, Huang Puhuang unit of the Twenty-first Independent Battalion dispatched by Liu Zhenxia's column of the people's armed forces of Southern Guangdong mobilized the masses in various places. By the end of last year, it had expanded the armed forces by more than 400 people and possessed weapons such as machine guns and submachine guns in addition to rifles. A new base has now been established in the Phoenix Township in Shangsi County. In addition, a part of the former officers' team headed by Chen Gaohe also organized and armed peasants in the area. In Longjin County in the upper reaches of the Lijiang River, there is a part of the people's armed forces with more than 1,000 people who once cut off the highway from Nanning to Longjin. On the upper reaches of the Xijiang River and the Pangiang River (i.e. the Qianjiang River), in Baise, Tianyang, Fengshan, Donglan, Wangang, Pingzhi and other counties, there are several people's armed forces, one of which once occupied Wangang County. In Duan and Shanglin counties, a part of the armed peasants led by Luo proposed the slogan of \"Opposing Bad Politics\". In Liujiang, Qianjiang, Binyang, Wuming and other counties, there are more than 1,000 people's armed forces (originally reported by Chiang Kai-shek's newspapers as five or six hundred) from the \"Peasant Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Force\" established during the Anti-Japanese War and those who gathered at @Lunkuan in the winter of 1946 to revolt against conscription. In Wuxuan County, a part of the people once attacked the county seat in November. The \"Democratic Allied Army\" appeared in Xiang County and @山区. The people's armed forces in Quanzhou, Xing'an, Guanyang, Gongcheng, Fuchuan and Hexian, which are adjacent to Xiang Province, have established the \"Guangdong Eastern Liberated Area\", with its base in Dupangling, Mengzhuling and Lingheling. There are organizations such as trade unions, peasant associations and women's federations in the mountains. At present, the people's armed forces in Guangxi have shaken the entire province, and the Chiang bandits in the province only have four security corps with a total of more than 4,000 people, so they are scrambling around in a mess. Huang Xuchu, the chairman of the Chiang bandits' provincial government, replaced the county heads of Quanzhou, Rong and other six counties at once in October last year.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 粤桂人民武装四起  控制地区达百余县　困扰蒋匪据点开始分田分粮\n\n1948-01-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　粤桂人民武装四起\n    控制地区达百余县\n    困扰蒋匪据点开始分田分粮\n    群众积极帮助军队大批知识青年参军 \n    占领海南岛四分之三解放人民二百五十万\n    东江发动武装农民我军口号到处传播\n    确掌农村进袭城市建立联军创根据地\n    【新华社陕北二日电】综合沪报讯：去年一年，粤省人民武装获得伟大发展，人数由二万余人发展达七万以上，活动地区由三十余县扩展至六十余县，占全省县数的大半；若干地区已形成人民武装控制的农村包围蒋匪孤立据点的形势；并开始了分田运动。其分布约分六区：\n    （一）南路：西起越南、粤、桂边境，东达阳春江八百余里的地区，全在人民武装控制之下。人民武装有两个纵队，每纵队三个师；一个纵队的根据地在十万大山地区之合浦、灵山、钦县、防城一带，现已扩充至三万余人。该部于去年五、六月间，由于刘镇夏率领之千余农民起义参加，自此声势愈大，发展愈速。该部起义于防城县属光坡、付沙二镇，一举攻占东兴，开仓济贫，宣传反对三征（指“征兵”、“征粮”、“征实”）。该纵队现已占领上述各县之全部农村及市镇。远近大、中学生参加该部者甚多。另一纵队由张世充领导，根据地在雷州半岛平原地带，南与海南岛人民解放军隔水呼应，西北与桂境勾漏山贺、横等县人民武装及十万大山刘镇夏部陆路相接。该纵队兵力截至十月底为止，已发展近万，并拥有大批舰船骡马所组成之水陆运输大队，来往各根据地之间。现整个半岛南起海南岛对岸的徐开县，北达廉江，东至化县吴川，除各县城及九个乡外，全为人民武装所解放或控制，徐闻县城亦已解放了；东面之茂名、电白、阳春、阳江则已成为游击区。该部也有大量知识青年参加。当地群众积极帮助自己的军队，在与蒋匪作战中，充任向导，出奇袭敌，使蒋匪报纸亦哀鸣：“当局之苦恼，不仅兵力不足，而且老百姓均已‘匪化’。”现与南路数万人民武装敌对之蒋匪只有该省保警处长陈沛所率之警保队两个团，陈匪自十月十日建立所谓“粤桂南区剿匪指挥部”以来，始终徘徊于茂名、信宜一带，不敢前进。\n    （二）海南岛人民解放军现已占领该岛四分之三，解放人民二百五十万。除占领村镇及白沙、乐东、保亭三县城外，近又攻占安定县城及东北海港清澜港。在人民解放军之强大攻势下，蒋匪部队龟缩琼州不敢出犯。蒋匪近增援两个保安总队，但人数不满二千，企图负隅挣扎。\n    （三）北路以大庾岭为根据地之“赣粤湘边区司令部”，率有“人民解放军北路纵队”一个师，活动于南雄、始兴、仁化、乐昌、翁源、龙南（赣境）、新丰一带，仅南雄一县，即有千余人。各县乡村均为人民武装控制，南雄已建立六个人民区政府及若干乡政府，并发动群众进行分田分粮运动。军民合作广泛展开困扰蒋匪的工作。南雄与蒋匪前广州行辕主任张发奎之家乡始兴，已和外界隔绝而成孤岛。十一月十八日人民武装破坏了美国援蒋补给线粤汉铁路英德、曲江间大坑口铁桥，并截断英德以北的北江水上的军运，一面保护商航及实行保护工商业的贸易管理。\n    （四）东江地区人民武装，近于海丰、陆丰、惠阳、紫金、博罗及以北之五华、龙川、河源、龙门、从化等县到处发动武装农民。十月廿六日，人民武装三百余人进攻港粤交界处罗坊、木湖、杨古岭三处将匪关卡，毙伤敌十人，缴获机枪一挺、步枪五枝，并散发人民解放军总部双十节颁布之六十七条口号及其他传单。十月十八日并炸毁蒋匪桂海轮，迫使港穗航运一度停顿。此外，珠江三角洲亦有人民武装一部活动。\n    （五）粤闽赣边区人民武装，有罗观桥、赖福元率领之“粤闽赣边区民众义勇队”二千余人，及梁饪、张乃馨部一千余人，活动于饶平、大埔、蕉岭、平远、梅县、和平及闽境武平，赣境寻邬等县，梁、张部曾屡创蒋匪“清剿”部队，攻克官塘、新塘、田村等市镇。十月二十一日，并曾进攻大埔县城。\n    （六）西江地区人民武装，有“人民义勇军”高要有、邓伍部，“民主联军”冯超、陈中高部及谢光汉部共二千余人，活动于开平、广宁等县。\n    【新华社陕北五日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：广西人民武装去年年底已扩展至三十九县，并到处发动与组织农民及进袭县城。西南部容江流域容县，藤县、北流、岭溪等县的民主联盟革命军已成立“民主联军独立第十师”，由黄世宪、李达领导，该部系于去年三月起义，当时曾攻入容县城，并一度占领藤县城，造成震惊敌胆的“藤容事件”。现已与广东雷州半岛的人民武装张世充纵队会合，以勾漏山区为根据地。陆川、博白、郁林等县有邹正领导之人民武装一部，已成立“化北军区司令部”，曾一度进攻郁林县城。郁江流域贵县、横县及永淳的莫平凡部，实力尤为雄厚，月前攻入贵、横二县城者即为该部。现该地区全部村镇，已为该部控制。十万大山北麓丽江两岸，南宁、扶南、上思、绥渌、崇善、思乐、养利、龙茗等县，有广东南路人民武装刘镇夏纵队派出之第二十一独立营黄埔煌部在各地发动群众，截至去年底止，已扩大了武装部队四百余人，除步枪外，拥有机枪、冲锋枪等武器。现已在上思县境凤凰乡一带建立新根据地。另有以陈高和为首包括旧军官总队队员之一部，亦在该地区组织与武装农民。丽江上游龙津县境有人民武装一部一千余，曾一度截断南宁通龙津的公路。西洋江流域及盘江（即黔江）上游沿岸的百色、田阳、凤山、东兰、万冈、平治等县，有人民武装数部，一部曾一度攻占万冈县城。都安、上林两县有罗某领导之武装农民一部，提出“反对坏政”口号。柳江、迁江、宾阳、武鸣等县有抗战中建立的“农民抗日自卫队”及四六年冬间为反抗抓丁而奔聚＠仑关起义的人民武装一千余（原据蒋区报纸报导为五六百）。武宣县境一部，十一月间曾一度攻入该县县城。象县及＠山区有“民主联军”出现。毗连湘境之全县、兴安、灌阳、恭城、富川、贺县的人民武装则已成立“桂东解放区”，其根据地为都庞岭、萌渚岭及临贺岭，在山地里有工会、农会、妇女会等组织。现广西人民武装已震荡全省，而该省蒋匪兵力只有四个保安总队，共四千余人因而手忙脚乱，该省蒋匪省主席黄旭初，于去年十月一次即撤换全、容等六县县长。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Dispatch: Moscow Radio broadcast on the 12th of last month a commentary by Massino criticizing Chiang Kai-shek for signing four traitorous agreements with U.S. imperialism within two months. It pointed out that U.S. imperialism is taking advantage of Chiang Kai-shek's weak and pitiable situation to plunder a large amount of the Chinese people's rights and interests from Chiang Kai-shek at extremely low prices. The original text stated:\n\n　　In two months, the Kuomintang reactionaries signed four agreements with U.S. imperialism selling out Chinese sovereignty. The first agreement was on October 17th, when the Kuomintang, in the form of a note, formally notified the United States that it agreed to the stationing of U.S. troops in China. This document confirms that the United States has its own armed forces in China (that is, has the right to establish military bases within China), using force to turn China into a U.S. military base.\n\n　　On October 27th, the so-called Sino-U.S. Relief Agreement was signed. This agreement allows the United States to supervise the use of \"Aid-China funds\" and materials, supervise the manufacturing of Chinese and other countries' imported goods, and control the use of the funds obtained from selling these goods. In reality, this gives the U.S. imperialism all the economic and domestic and foreign trade administrative power of the Kuomintang-controlled areas.\n\n　　The third agreement was signed on November 10th, and it is formally called the \"U.S. Educational Foundation in China Agreement.\" It stipulates that the United States can establish specialized educational institutions in China. This is effectively handing over China's educational and cultural sovereignty to the United States.\n\n　　In four weeks, the Kuomintang sold out the Chinese people's rights and interests in many aspects to U.S. imperialism. This is because the four major families believe that American aid is the only hope to delay their demise. They are prepared to sell everything for this. The greed of the U.S. imperialists increases as the foundation of the Kuomintang reactionaries becomes increasingly shaken, while the dollars given to their lackeys are decreasing. They are taking advantage of the Kuomintang's weak and pitiable position in order to obtain more practical benefits at a low price. The American bankers used this purely usurious method to force the Kuomintang reactionaries to sign three agreements in a few weeks, while actually only paying 27.7 million U.S. dollars. What a profitable deal! Moreover, this money was not paid in U.S. dollars but in grain. The use of the grain and the funds obtained from its sale are still subject to U.S. supervision.\n\n　　Not long ago, the United States promised to give the Kuomintang a large amount of loans. Now, as the Kuomintang's reactionary situation worsens, the United States has reduced its promise to a so-called emergency aid of 60 million U.S. dollars (Xinhua News Agency note: According to a Washington dispatch from the U.S. Information Service on the 19th, the U.S. Congress passed a reduction to 18 million U.S. dollars) and broad aid of 300 million U.S. dollars. Based on these constantly declining conditions, new enslaving treaties are being negotiated simultaneously in Nanjing and Washington. According to the Nanjing Evening News on November 21st, the content of this negotiation is very extensive. Regarding the issue of attitude towards the international situation, the Kuomintang and the U.S. government have reached further \"mutual understanding.\"\n\n　　The first result of this negotiation was the \"Sino-U.S. Naval Agreement\" formally announced on December 8th – the fourth treaty enslaving China signed in two months. The first part of the agreement stipulates that the United States will hand over 140 warships to the Kuomintang (in fact, 100 of them have already been handed over to the Kuomintang). It seems that this agreement does not offer anything new. The role of the United States in signing this agreement lies in the second part. The second part stipulates that in order to establish the Kuomintang's naval organization, the United States will help it train cadres, while the Kuomintang will provide the United States with naval intelligence. In other words, the United States has obtained the right to supervise the Kuomintang's naval fleet and cadres, and has obtained the right to establish naval bases in China. While establishing training bases for the Kuomintang Navy, the United States can establish its own bases. This agreement is an extension of the U.S. military's formal stationing agreement in China announced on October 17th. Combined, these two agreements mean that the Kuomintang's armed forces are completely Americanized, turning them into a tool of U.S. imperialism.\n\n　　U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries are still preparing many other treaties to enslave the Chinese people. On December 8th, the day the \"Sino-U.S. Naval Agreement\" was signed, the Shanghai Shen Bao said that the Kuomintang Central Political Conference discussed how to obtain American trust and sympathy, as well as massive aid. This means that the Kuomintang is prepared for a new sell-out of the vital interests of the Chinese people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美帝乘蒋匪危急时廉价盗买中国主权  美蒋两个月作了四桩买卖\n\n1948-01-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美帝乘蒋匪危急时廉价盗买中国主权\n    美蒋两个月作了四桩买卖\n    【新华社陕北电】莫斯科电台上月十二日广播马西努评论蒋匪两个月内与美帝国主义签订了四个卖国协定。指出美帝国主义正乘蒋介石危弱可怜的处境，以极低廉代价从蒋匪手中掠夺中国人民大量权益。原文称：\n    两个月来国民党反动派与美帝国主义签订了四个出卖中国主权的协定。第一个协定是十月十七日国民党用照会形式，正式通知美国同意美军留驻中国。这个文件证实美国在中国拥有自己的武装力量（也就是有权力在中国境内建立军事根据地），以武力把中国变成美国的军事根据地。\n    十月二十七日又签订了所谓中美救济协定。这个协定容许美国监督“援华基金”及物资的利用，监管中国制造及其他国家输入的物资，及管制出卖这些物资所得到的款项的利用。这实际上是把国民党统治区全部经济及其对内对外贸易行政权，让给美帝国主义。\n    第三个协定是十一月十日签订的，它在形式上叫做“美国在华教育基金协定”。它规定美国在中国可以建立专门教育机关。这实际上是把中国的教育及文化主权送给了美国。\n    在四个星期内，国民党把中国人民多方面的权益都出卖给美帝国主义。这是由于四大家族认为美国的援助是延缓他们灭亡的唯一希望。他们为此已准备出卖一切。美帝国主义者的贪欲，随着国民党反动派根基的日益动摇而增高，同时发给其走狗的美金却日益减少。他们利用国民党处在危弱可怜的地位，以便以低廉的代价，取得更多的实际利益。美国银行家用这种纯粹高利贷的手腕，逼使国民党反动派在几个星期内签订了三个协定，而自己实际上只支付了二千七百七十万美元。这是多么有利的买卖啊！而且这笔款他们并不是用美金而是用粮食支付的。粮食的利用及买卖所得的款项还得受美国监督。\n    不久以前，美国答应给国民党大量的贷款，现在当国民党反动情况更加恶劣时，美国把自己的诺言减到所谓紧急援助六千万美元（新华社按：据美新闻处华盛顿十九日电称：美国会通过削减为一千八百万美元）和广泛援助的三万万美元。根据这些不断下降的条件，在南京与华盛顿两地正同时开始了新的奴役条约的谈判。据十一月二十一日南京晚报透露：这个谈判所包括的内容是非常广泛的，关于对于国际时局态度问题，国民党与美国政府之间达到了进一步的“相互谅解”。\n    这个谈判的第一个结果，是十二月八日正式宣布的“中美海军协定”——这是两个月内签订的第四个奴役中国的条约。协定中第一部分规定美国以一百四十艘舰船交给国民党（其实其中的一百艘早就交给国民党了）。这样看来，这一协定并没有给出什么新的东西，美国签订这个协定的作用是在第二部分。第二部分规定：为了建立国民党海军机构，美国帮助它培养干部，国民党则供给美国以海军的情报。换句话说：美国得到了对国民党海军舰队和干部的监督权，并取得在中国建立海军根据地的权利。在建立训练国民党海军基地的同时，美国就可以建立自己的根据地了。这个协定是十月十七日所公布的美军正式驻华协定的扩大。这两个协定综合起来，是国民党武装完全美国化，把它变成美帝国主义的工具。\n    美帝国主义和国民党反动派，还在准备其他许多奴役中国人民的条约。十二月八日，就是在“中美海军协定”签订的那一天，上海申报说：在国民党中央政治会议上，讨论了怎样获得美国的信任与同情以及大量援助的问题。这就是说国民党已准备着对中国人民切身利益的新出卖。"

Shanghai, 28th Dispatch: An article published in the Shanghai-based American \"Millard's Review\" by Austrian UNRRA official Frederick A. Jenson, proves that UNRRA was a tool for American aid to Chiang Kai-shek's aggression against China. Jenson pointed out that UNRRA's \"relief\" in China was merely a conspiracy, saying: \"There is strong evidence that the entire conspiracy was implemented under the leadership of the U.S. State Department from beginning to end. The State Department opposed UNRRA adopting a non-discriminatory policy.\" Jenson proved that the U.S. State Department took the lead in preventing relief supplies from being transported to the Liberated Areas. Jenson said: Trucks and locomotives sent to China were used to transport troops fighting the civil war, grain sent to China enabled the government (Kuomintang) to feed its troops, textiles were used for military uniforms, money from the sale of relief supplies was used to support the army, and machinery and technical equipment fell into the hands of the most reactionary bureaucrats, strengthening their power. Relief supplies were used as political bribes following the \"Kuomintang\" offensive army and to support landlord groups to prevent other political activities. At the same time, millions of people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas who participated in the heroic War of Resistance Against Japan were trapped in hunger and cold and received no relief. Jenson said: UNRRA supported the Kuomintang in engaging in a civil war, the purpose of which was to oppose the Communist Party which was implementing land reform and all people in the Kuomintang-ruled areas who demanded democracy and freedom. However, after the end of World War II, the basic demand of the Chinese people was the redistribution of land as a basis for making a living.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. According to a foreign news agency dispatch from Qingdao on the 1st: Students of Chiang Kai-shek's Shandong University in Qingdao went on strike and demonstrated on New Year's Day, protesting against the university president's embezzlement when distributing UNRRA relief supplies, and selling UNRRA medical equipment such as heroin (narcotics). The striking students demanded a thorough investigation of this corruption case.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 联总官员詹生证明　联总援蒋侵华\n\n1948-01-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　联总官员詹生证明\n  　联总援蒋侵华\n    【新华社陕北四日电】上海二十八日消息：联总官员奥地利人弗罗德力克Ａ·詹生在上海美商密勒士评论报上发表的文章，证明联总为美国援蒋侵华工具。詹生指出联总在中国的“救济”只是一个阴谋诡计，他说：“有强有力的证明整个阴谋诡计，从头到尾都是在美国国务院领导之下实现的，国务院反对联总采取不歧视政策。”詹生证明美国务院曾带头来阻止救济物资运往解放区。詹生说：运到中国的卡车和火车头都被用来运输打内战的军队，运到中国的粮食使政府（国民党）能够用它来养活其军队，纺织品用来作军衣，出售救济物资得来的钱用来支持军队，机器与技术设备落入最反动的官僚之手，加强了他们的力量，救济物资被用作紧跟着“国民党”进攻军之后的政治上的收买和用以支持地主团体不作其他政治勾当。同时成千百万参加英勇抗日战争的国民党地区人民，则陷于饥寒交迫，毫未得到救济。詹生说：联总支持国民党从事内战，这个内战的目的是反对实行土地改革的共产党及国民党统治区域一切要求民主自由的人民。但第二次世界大战结束后，中国人民的基本要求就是重新分配土地作为谋生的基础。\n    【新华社陕北四日电】据外国通讯社青岛一日讯：青岛蒋记山东大学学生于元旦罢课游行，反对该校校长在分配联总救济物资时贪污，将联总医药器材海洛英（麻醉剂）等出售。罢课游行学生要求澈查此一贪污案。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-08",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. Moscow Radio recently broadcast Marcinow's commentary on the Chiang government's recent \"economic emergency measures,\" stating: The Kuomintang has recently announced so-called emergency measures and established a \"Financial Control Bureau.\" Kuomintang spokesmen claim that the establishment of this agency is intended to sanction speculators and stabilize prices. Similar emergency measures were announced in great numbers last spring, but the result was even more severe inflation and speculation. At the end of the year before last, the total amount of currency in circulation was 7 trillion yuan; by last spring, it had reached 18 trillion yuan, causing the legal tender to depreciate eightfold and the cost of living to increase tenfold. The Kuomintang's budget also increased further, which was the result of implementing emergency financial measures.\n\nTo shirk responsibility for this unprecedented bankruptcy, the Kuomintang reactionary authorities falsely claimed that it was due to the sabotage of the Chinese Communist Party. However, the Chinese people know that the Kuomintang authorities are the real culprits behind the financial and economic crisis in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. People only need to compare the different economic situations in the two regions of China to expose the Kuomintang reactionaries' absurd rumors and slanders. The Liberated Areas are economically relatively backward regions, not only suffering from the attacks of the Kuomintang army but also subject to economic blockade. However, the Liberated Areas can be self-reliant without foreign aid, and there is no hyperinflation or economic crisis. Conversely, the Kuomintang-controlled areas include major industrial, financial, and commercial regions, and they enjoy substantial aid from the United States, yet they are increasingly mired in economic bankruptcy. The reason for the difference between these two regions is that they are implementing two different policies: the achievements of the Liberated Areas in revitalizing and developing the national economy are primarily due to the establishment of a genuine democratic government here. Conversely, the Kuomintang-controlled areas are ruled by a reactionary government. The American magazine *Amerasia* pointed out that those in power should be held responsible for the crisis. In Kuomintang China, those bureaucratic economic groups who control economic and political power use their power and the huge private monopolies supported by the government to seize economic dominance in China. A Chinese economist wrote in the *Far Eastern Economic Review* that Kuomintang monopoly capitalists use military and political power, manipulate import and export and banking privileges, buy goods at low prices, and sell them at high prices, obtaining huge profits. They are waging an anti-democratic civil war for these super-profits. Kuomintang monopoly capitalists have also engaged in strangling China's productive forces – China's national industry and commerce and agriculture. To feed their own army and police, maintain a huge bureaucracy, and ensure the super-profits of the four big families, they ruthlessly exploit the wealth of the Chinese people. The inflation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the poverty and famine suffered by the people, and the massive bankruptcy of national industry and commerce are the sources of wealth for the four big feudal comprador families. And the Kuomintang's many measures nominally aimed at curbing speculation are the reasons for increasing speculation and accelerating the crisis. In reality, this is merely transferring the power of speculation to speculators and the power to supervise prices to those who monopolize currency. The power of the newly established Financial Control Bureau is also entirely in the hands of the Kuomintang financial magnates who are getting rich. This new agency is clearly not fighting against prices but fighting for the profits of the four big families.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋党成立“金融管理局”　实际是为四大家族发财  马西努评蒋家“经济紧急措施”\n\n1948-01-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋党成立“金融管理局”\n  　实际是为四大家族发财\n    马西努评蒋家“经济紧急措施”\n    【新华社陕北六日电】莫斯科电台近发表马西努对蒋政府最近的“经济紧急措施”评论称：国民党最近又宣布了所谓非常设施，成立“金融管理局”。国民党发言人声称：他们成立这个机关，是希望制裁投机商人和稳定物价。象这样的非常措施在去年春天曾宣布过一大串，结果通货膨胀和投机更加厉害了。前年年底流通钞总额为七万亿元，去年春天已达到了十八万亿元，于是法币价格下跌八倍，生活费则增加了十倍，国民党的预算也更加增加了，这就是实施非常财政设施的结果。\n    国民党反动当局为了卸脱这种空前破产应负的责任，就撒谎说这是由于中国共产党的破坏。可是中国人民都知道，国民党当局是国民党统治区财政经济危机的真正罪人。人们只要比较一下中国两种地区不同的经济情况，就能揭穿国民党反动派造谣诽谤的无稽。解放区在经济上是比较落后的地区，不仅遭受着国民党军队的进攻，且受着经济上的封锁，但解放区并无外国援助而能自力更生，在解放区没有恶性通货膨胀和经济危机；相反的，国民党统治区是包括着主要工业和金融商业的区域，它享受着美国方面的大量援助，可是他们却日益陷入了经济破产的泥沼中。这两个区域所以不同，是由于两个区域实行着两种不同的政策：解放区在复兴和发展国民经济方面的成绩，首先是由于在这里成立了真正的民主政权，相反的国民党统治区是反动政府当权。美国的美亚杂志曾指出那些掌握政权的人，对危机应该负起责任，在国民党中国，那些掌握经济和政治权力的官僚、经济集团，他们利用权势及由政府扶持的庞大私人的垄断，夺取了在中国的经济地位。中国一位经济学家在“远东经济评论”杂志上著文指出：国民党独占资本家利用军事和政治大权，利用操纵进出口和银行特权，按低价收买货物，再以高价出卖，获得巨大利润，他们正是为了这超额利润而进行着反民主的内战。国民党独占资本家同时还进行了绞杀中国生产力——中国民族工商业及农业的工作。他们为了饲养自己的军队和警察，为了维持庞大的官僚机关，为了四大家族的超额利润，而残忍的剥削中国人民的财富。国民党统治区的通货膨胀，人民遭受贫困和饥荒、民族工商业大批破产，这就是四大封建买办家族发财致富的来源。而国民党名为制裁投机的许多措施，就是增加投机和推进危机的原因，实际上这只不过是将投机的权力转交给投机分子，把物价的监督权力转交给那些垄断货币的分子。现在新设金融管理局的权力，也是完全掌握在发财致富的国民党财政大王手中的，这个新机构显然不是与物价作斗争，而是为四大家族的利润而斗争。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th—As the Lunar New Year approaches, prices in various Chiang-controlled areas are skyrocketing. According to various sources: In Shenyang, as of the 20th of last month, the price of rice had reached 3.5 million Chiang currency per shi (石, a unit of dry measure), more than double the price of rice in Shanghai; flour was 1.4 million per bag; and even sorghum cost 20,000 per jin (斤, a unit of weight). On the 23rd, starving masses stormed two Korean rice shops and completely looted the rice. Lower-level clerks and staff in Chiang's various agencies are also facing severe threats to their lives due to salaries far below prices. From the 20th to the 25th, seven clerks committed suicide due to living problems. Prices in Changchun are also rising daily, and poor students have no food or clothing. Some students are forced to become robbers. On the 17th, a cloth robbery case was cracked in Changchun, committed by one university student and four middle school students driven by hunger. Schools in Changchun have stopped issuing coal due to tight budgets. For example, at the Ninth Branch of the Northeast United Middle School, students are attending classes in the dormitories. More than 600 female students in the Sixth Branch of the United Middle School are taking classes in bed under their blankets. Teachers' salaries have also been unpaid for several months. Prices in Taiyuan, under the rule of the bandit Yan Xishan, continue to soar. Second-class flour had risen to 1.4 million by the 18th, millet was 18,000 per jin, and sorghum flour, which the majority of citizens rely on for food, jumped from 9,000 to 9,500 per jin in a few days. Cotton was 100,500 per jin, and coarse cloth sold for 40,000 to 50,000 per chi (尺, a unit of length). The average price index has reached more than 500,000 times pre-war levels, the highest in the country. In Shanghai and Nanjing, rice prices have risen even more sharply since the end of last month. Coupled with the severe cold weather, people are dying from hunger and cold. By the 21st of last month, more than 300 corpses had been found frozen to death on the streets of Shanghai. On the 20th alone, 64 corpses were found. In addition, in Dihua, Xinjiang, prices have fluctuated dramatically since the issuance of new 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 yuan notes on the 25th of last month. Prices in Xi'an and other places began to soar in the middle of last month. Cotton yarn rose by 6 million in two days, with each bale costing more than 32 million. Since the liberation of Shijiazhuang, prices in Beiping have soared, with the black market price of gold reaching 12 million per tael (两, a unit of weight). Local flour has also risen to 10,000 per jin, and a bowl of cabbage soup, which coolies and vendors eat, costs 1,600.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋区物价飞涨　逼得大学生市民抢米抢布  上海街上一天冻死六十人\n\n1948-01-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋区物价飞涨\n  　逼得大学生市民抢米抢布\n    上海街上一天冻死六十人\n    【新华社陕北四日电】旧历年关在即，蒋管区各地物价均猛烈飞涨。综合各方消息：沈阳物价截至上月二十日止，大米每市石已高达蒋币三百五十万元，高出上海米价两倍以上，面粉一百四十万元一袋，高粱每斤也要二万元。二十三日，饥饿群众曾冲入两家朝鲜人米店将米完全抢光。蒋匪各机关中下级小职员亦因薪水远低于物价，生活受到严重威胁，自二十日至廿五日数日内，已有七个职员为生活问题自杀。长春物价亦连日高涨，穷苦学生无衣无食，有些学生被迫当强盗，十七日长春市破获一抢布案件，即一个大学生四个中学生在饥饿逼迫下所为。长市各学校因经费拮据已停止发煤，如东北联立中学第九分校，学生均在寝室上课。该联中第六分班女生六百余人，均卧被中受课。教职员薪金也已数月未发。阎贼统治下的太原物价继续飞涨，二等面粉至十八日已涨至一百四十余万元，小米每市斤一万八千元，广大市民赖以为食的高粱面，于数日中又由每斤九千元跃至九千五百元，棉花每斤十万零五千元，土布每尺售价达四、五万元，平均物价指数已达战前五十余万倍，为全国之冠。上海、南京米价，自上月下旬以来，上涨更烈，加以天气严寒，人民纷纷死于饥寒之下，至上月廿一日，上海街道上已发现冻毙而死之尸首三百余具，仅二十日一天，就发现六十四具。此外新疆迪化由于上月二十五日发行二千、五千、一万及二万元新钞，物价已剧烈波动。西安等地物价自前月中旬已开始飞涨，两日内棉纱上涨六百万元，每包价达三千二百余万元。自石家庄解放后，北平物价大涨，黄金黑市每两已达一千二百万元。当地面粉每斤亦涨至万元，苦力小贩所食的白菜汤，一碗即需一千六百元。"

According to the workers, \"Our salaries are not enough to feed us, so we have no choice but to slow down our work.\" Customs employees also said, \"Our salaries are not enough to buy adequate food, so we cannot be expected to work 'adequately'.\" The Chiang Kai-shek Shanghai Municipal Government announced at the end of the new calendar year that the December cost of living index for workers was 68,200 times the base level, and for employees 58,600 times, far less than half of the actual price index of 145,000 times. The news further incited extreme public outrage among the workers. In other news: Pilots and sailors in Tianjin began a strike on the 28th of last month to protest the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army's shooting at merchant ships entering the port with rifles and machine guns on the 26th, and the indiscriminate arrest of a chief mate and two crew members.

In addition to forcing citizens to store three months' worth of grain and levying over one million yuan in Chiang currency to reinforce city defenses, they have also carried out large-scale bloody massacres of innocent people and former subordinates of Zhao Shoushan and Kong Congzhou. Ma Qingwan, long despised by the people of Shaanxi, has been re-employed in an attempt to win over Northwest Army officers. The Hu bandits and others are also attempting to establish \"Self-Defense Regiments\" in various counties, one regiment for first-class counties, one battalion for second-class counties, and one company for third-class counties. In early September, Pan Yuan, the Chiang bandit county magistrate of Weinan County, falsely reported to Zhu Shaozhou that the \"Self-Defense Regiment\" had been established on schedule. Unexpectedly, two or three hours later, eight or nine vehicles arrived from Xi'an to transport the \"Self-Defense Regiment\" to the front lines. The county magistrate was in a cold sweat and had to send the \"Self-Defense Regiment,\" hired to defend the city for 300,000 gold yuan a month. Despite the Hu bandits' strict blockade of news, the news of the annihilation of the Hu bandit's main force, the 76th Division, in Qingjian in October, and the capture of Liao Ang, still reached the ears of the common people, greatly encouraging the people of Xi'an.

Everyone was extremely resentful. Squad Leader Wang picked up a machine gun and fired, Li Mingshan and Zuo Meng charged towards the enemy with bayonets, and the other soldiers also threw grenades. The enemy soldiers wavered, and a deputy battalion commander shouted in a trembling voice: \"We surrender! We surrender!\" When the soldiers rushed up, more than three hundred enemy soldiers had already placed all their weapons on the ground in front of them.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Battle situation for the week from January 1st to 7th:\n\n　　East China Battlefield: After the Central China People's Liberation Army annihilated 9,000 enemies in the southern front at the beginning of last month, the Chiang bandit forces panicked and pieced together five or six regiments, about 17,000 men, led by Wang Yan, commander of the reorganized 51st Division, to rush to the southern front for rescue. After failing to find our forces in Dongtai, Rugao and other places, they invaded north along the Tongyu Highway on December 26th and advanced to the south of Yeting City, where they were immediately surrounded and attacked by our forces. After four days and nights of fierce fighting, the battle ended on the night of the 29th, annihilating more than 7,000 Chiang bandit troops, only half a month after the victory on the southern front. This victory in Yeting marks the \"Central China People's Liberation Army's victorious opening of the prelude to a major counter-offensive,\" and \"after this campaign, the Central China People's Liberation Army has completely grasped the initiative\" (Xinhua Daily Central China Edition editorial). Therefore, it has laid a solid foundation for greater victories this year, recovering all lost territories in Central China, and more powerfully coordinating the counter-offensive of the various armies on the southern front.\n\n　　The Huaibei Liberated Area, which is closely linked to the Northern Jiangsu and Central Jiangsu Liberated Areas, was almost entirely lost at the end of the year before last. However, after nearly a year of arduous struggle by the Huaibei people's armed forces, and after experiencing countless severe tests, breaking the Chiang bandit and puppet army Sun Liangcheng's several \"pursuits\" and \"encirclements,\" they not only established a firm foothold but also recovered vast lost territories. Currently, the vast rural areas east of the Jinpu Railway, west of the Grand Canal, and south of the Hai (zhou) Zheng (zhou) Highway, covering more than 10,000 square kilometers, are controlled by the democratic government.\n\n　　In the Laiyang area of Jiaodong: The People's Liberation Army completely defeated the Chiang bandit's eight brigades that re-invaded Laiyang. From December 14th to the end of the month, they annihilated more than 4,600 enemy troops. After the Chiang bandit forces invading Laiyang were repeatedly blocked by our forces for a long time, they crawled to the Taoyuanzhuang line, 18 miles southwest of Laiyang, on the 23rd of last month. However, our army had already preemptively inserted itself into the flanks and rear of the Chiang bandit forces, cutting off their traffic between Lingshan and Shuigoutou. At this point, the entire line of the Chiang bandit forces was shaken, and they turned around and fled south on the 26th amidst heavy snow, collapsing for dozens of miles, giving us a good opportunity to pursue and annihilate the enemy. Including the failure of the Chiang bandit reinforcements to Laiyang at the beginning of last month, the total losses before and after have reached more than 8,100, while Laiyang City is still in the hands of the people. The Chiang bandit Central News Agency's daily boasting of occupying Laiyang and the \"meeting\" with the defending troops is just to cover up its failure.\n\n　　Southern Front New Area: Since the three major liberated areas have been connected, the three-way People's Liberation Army has continuously achieved victories through coordinated operations. After the major victory of the SuLuYuWan and YuShaan'e People's Liberation Army in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, they cooperated and annihilated the Fifth Army Corps Command and the Reorganized 3rd Division of the enemy south of Xiping, annihilating nearly 10,000 enemy troops. Taking advantage of the victory, they went south and surrounded the Chiang bandit Reorganized 20th Division, which was transferred north from the Dabie Mountains as reinforcements, in the suburbs of Queshan City on the evening of December 29th. After two days of fierce fighting, they annihilated two battalions of the division in the Sanlidian area north of the city, and successively killed and wounded more than 2,000 Chiang bandit troops defending the city. The Chiang bandit forces were deeply afraid that Queshan would be lost and hurriedly drew troops from the Dabie Mountains to reinforce Queshan, such as the Reorganized 9th Division, Reorganized 10th Division, and Reorganized 11th Division, further demonstrating the enemy's predicament in the Central Plains battlefield of robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n\n　　The military and civilians of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Liberated Area have successfully smashed the Chiang bandit's \"mopping up\" of the Dabie Mountains by gathering 33 brigades, and have opened up vast territories in the Tongbai and Jianghan military regions. In the past 20 days, the military and civilians in the area have successively annihilated 2,000 enemy troops, captured 11 county towns, and cooperated with the SuLuYuWan and YuShaan'e two major brother units to continue expanding the results of the battle. In the past ten days, they have also recovered the county towns of Qianshan, Jingfu, Huangmei, and Lishan in the Dabie Mountains, and continued to shake the rear of the Chiang bandit forces along both banks of the Hanshui River, successively capturing more than 40 towns such as Mianyang, and annihilating more than 1,900 enemy troops. The Chiang bandit's boasted \"mopping up\" of the Dabie Mountains has not only become a bubble, but the anti-\"mopping up\" battle in the past month has further proved that the newly liberated peasants in the Dabie Mountains have close ties with the People's Liberation Army and have strengthened their struggle against the enemy in the land reform movement, so that the enemy, once entering the mountains, is like a blind man groping for fish, suffering blows from our army everywhere. The development of this situation guarantees that the Dabie Mountains will forever belong to the people.\n\n　　In order to cooperate with the offensive on the southern front, a part of the SuLuYuWan People's Liberation Army captured Dongming County, the southernmost county in Hebei Province, on December 30th, completely annihilating the defending enemy and capturing Ding Shuben, the Commissioner of the 14th Special Administrative Region of Hebei Province and Lieutenant General Commander of the Security Forces. The JiLuYu Local Corps also annihilated more than 1,300 enemy troops on the north bank of the Wen River and recovered Dongping County.\n\n　　Northeast Battlefield: The Northeast People's Liberation Army's winter offensive operation continues to unfold. In the week from December 29th to January 4th, it successively captured the three cities of Beipiao, Heishan, and Tai'an in the eastern Rehe and western Liaoning areas, cutting off the Beining Line between Xinmin and Jinzhou, and capturing Dahushan, an important railway junction on the line. The defending enemy of Beipiao, the temporarily organized 20th Division of the 93rd Army, fled in advance. Our troops tracked and pursued them, annihilating most of them in the Sanjiazi area on the Bei (piao) Fu (xin) Highway, capturing more than 1,000 enemy officers and soldiers, and killing and wounding more than 400. Since then, we have successively recovered 10 county towns in the winter offensive. The great victory of the Northeast People's Liberation Army (Democratic Allied Army) in annihilating more than 280,000 enemy troops and capturing 65 cities in the past year of last year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a special telegram to congratulate and encourage them to strive for the complete liberation of the Northeast.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 一周综合战况\n\n1948-01-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　一周综合战况\n    【新华社陕北七日电】一月一日至七日一周战况：\n    华东战场：华中人民解放军自上月初在南线歼敌九千之后，蒋匪惊惶失措拼凑了五六个团约一万七千余人兵力，由整五十一师师长王严率领，赶往南线救援，先后在东台、如皋等地扑空，十二月二十六日又沿通榆公路北犯，进至叶挺城南，即遭我包围合击，经四昼夜激战，到二十九日夜战斗结束，歼灭蒋匪七千余人，距南线大捷时仅半月。叶南这一胜利标志着“华中人民解放军胜利揭开大举反攻序幕”，“经此战役后，华中人民解放军已完全掌握了主动”（新华日报华中版社论语）。因此它已为今年更大的胜利，收复华中一切失地，以及更有力配合南线各路大军的反攻奠定了坚实的基础。\n    与苏北苏中解放区紧密相联的淮北解放区在前年年底几是全部沦陷，但经淮北人民武装将近一年的艰苦奋斗，经历了无数次严重考验，打破了蒋匪及伪军孙良诚等部的几次“追剿”“围剿”，不仅扎稳了根，而且收复了广大失地，目前津浦路东，运河以西，海（州）郑（州）公路以南，共万余方公里的广大农村已为民主政权所控制。\n    在胶东莱阳地区：解放军完全击溃再犯莱阳的蒋匪八个旅，自十二月十四日迄月底止，再歼敌四千六百余人。进犯莱阳的蒋匪在长期受我节节阻击之后，上月二十三日爬行到距莱阳西南十八里之桃园庄一线，而我军已先机插入蒋匪侧后，截断其灵山至水沟头的交通，蒋匪至此全线震动，乃于二十六日扭头南窜，在大风雪中一溃数十里，给我追踪歼敌的良机。连上月初旬蒋匪增援莱阳不成，损兵折将合计在内，前后损失已达八千一百余名，而莱阳城至今仍在人民手里，蒋匪中央社连日大吹占领莱阳，与守军“会师”等，只不过是为其失败遮羞而已。\n    南线新区：自从三大解放区连成一片以后，三路解放军协同作战不断取得胜利。苏鲁豫皖与豫陕鄂解放军于平汉南段大捷后，协同作战，一举歼敌第五兵团司令部及整三师于西平之南，歼敌近万，并乘胜南下，十二月二十九日晚又将由大别山区北调增援的蒋匪整二十师包围于确山城郊，经二日激战，歼灭该师二个营于城北之三里店地区，并先后毙伤守城蒋匪二千余人，蒋匪深恐确山不保，仓皇从大别山区抽调整九师、整十师、整十一师等部增援确山，愈益显示中原战场敌人挖肉补疮招架为难的困境。\n    鄂豫皖解放区军民已胜利粉碎了蒋匪纠集卅三个旅对大别山区的“扫荡”，并开拓了桐柏、江汉两军区广大土地。二十余日来该区军民先后歼敌二千，攻克县城十一座，并配合苏鲁豫皖、豫陕鄂两大兄弟部队作战，继续扩张战果。最近十日间又收复了大别山区潜山、经扶、黄梅、礼山等县城，并在汉水沿河两岸继续震撼蒋匪后方，连克沔阳等城镇四十余处，歼敌一千九百余名。蒋匪所吹嘘的大别山区“扫荡”不仅成为泡影，而一月来的反“扫荡”战斗却进一步证明了大别山区新翻身农民，已与解放军有着密切联系，并在土地改革运动中加强了对敌斗争，以致敌一进入山区即如瞎子摸鱼，处处受我军打击，这一情势的发展，保证大别山区将永属人民所有。\n    为配合南线攻势，苏鲁豫皖解放军一部于十二月三十日一举攻克河北省最南端的东明县城，全歼守敌并活捉蒋伪河北省十四专署专员兼中将保安司令丁树本。冀鲁豫地方兵团亦于汶河北岸歼敌一千三百余名，收复东平县城。\n    东北战场：东北人民解放军冬季攻势作战继续展开，于上月二十九日至本月四日一周间又于热东辽西地区连克北票、黑山、台安三城，斩断新民至锦州间之北宁线，攻克该线上重要铁路联结点打虎山。北票守敌九十三军暂二十师一个团事先逃窜，我跟踪追击将其大部歼灭于北（票）阜（新）公路上三家子一带，俘匪官兵一千余名，毙伤四百余名。自此冬季攻势中我先后收复县城已达十座。去年一年内东北人民解放军（民主联军）歼敌二十八万余人，克城六十五座的伟大胜利，中共中央特电致贺并勉为完全解放东北而奋斗。"

Many comrades wrote letters to the presidium of the conference, saying that they are determined to deeply reflect, correct their mistakes, and serve the people to the end in the future. Li Guanglu said: \"Because of my landlord ideology and actions to protect landlords, and unclear economic procedures, the Party decided to expel me from the Party, which I fully agree with. But I am still willing to work under the leadership of the Party and be a more complete proletarian fighter.\" Wu Sixing also expressed the same sentiment. After Liu Peng was expelled from the Party, he said that this punishment was absolutely necessary, as it was for the sake of the Party's purity and consolidation. He self-critically stated: \"I am not weeping for my Party membership being revoked, but only hate my serious mistakes that have harmed my more than seventeen years of political life. This is even more painful than being shot. Today I have lost my mother—the Party, but I will never be discouraged. I believe I have the courage to pick up new weapons and fight against these mistakes, and I will work as a hired laborer for the people until death.\" The presidium expressed unlimited welcome to their attitude and sent their applications to the Organization Department of the Central Bureau for filing. The Central Bureau believes that the Party has adopted a serious attitude towards the mistakes they have committed and must punish them. However, as long as they are determined to correct their mistakes and honestly serve the people in action, the Party will still embrace them with full enthusiasm and hope, and will definitely help them and give them the opportunity to reform.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 全区土地会议受处分同志　向党表示决心改错\n\n1948-01-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　全区土地会议受处分同志\n  　向党表示决心改错\n    【本报消息】全区土地会议上，经过查阶级、查思想、查作风后，因过去在土地改革中犯错误而受到党处分的同志，表示虚心接收。不少同志写信给大会主席团，说今后决心深入反省，改正错误，为人民服务到底。李光禄说：“因我地主思想和包庇地主行动，经济手续不清，党决定开除我的党籍，我很同意。但仍愿在党的领导下工作，作一个较完整的无产阶级战士。”吴思行亦有同样表示。刘鹏被开除党籍后，他说这个处分完全必要，这是为了党的纯洁和巩固。他自我检讨道：“我不是痛哭我的党籍被开除，只有痛恨我严重的错误害了我十七年多的政治生命。这比枪毙我还痛心。今天我失掉了母亲——党，但我决不灰心，我相信我有勇气拿起新的武器，和这些错误作斗争，生死要为人民当长工。”主席团，对他们这种态度，表示无限欢迎，当将他们申请书送交中央局组织部归了档案。中央局认为党对他们所犯的错误，是采取严肃的态度，必须予以处分，但只要他们决心改正错误，在行动上老老实实为人民服务，党对他们仍抱有满腔热忱和希望，一定帮助他们，给予改过机会。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, 7th: This reporter from the Central China Branch commented on the military struggle situation in Central China over the past year, saying: \"The military struggle in Central China over the past year has progressed from victorious perseverance to victorious counter-offensive.\"\n\n　　At the end of 1946, the Central China Liberated Area, which threatened the heart of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, was completely behind enemy lines. The enemy concentrated up to twenty regular army brigades, plus security forces, totaling 200,000 men, to conduct a brutal and inhumane comprehensive \"encirclement and suppression\" of this area. Their deployment was as follows: the southern line used Taixing, Taizhou, Jingjiang, Rugao, Nantong, Qidong, Haimen and other places along the Yangtze River in central Jiangsu as strongholds; the northern line used Donghai, Guanyun, Shuyang, Suqian and other places south of the Longhai Railway as strongholds; the central line used Siyang, Huaiyin, Huai'an, Baoying, Gaoyou, and Qintong along the Grand Canal as strongholds; and the western line used the area west of the Grand Canal and east of the Jinpu Railway in northern and southern Huai as strongholds, cooperating with each other to repeatedly encircle and attack, attempting to achieve the conspiracy of completely controlling Central China. They also implemented the \"Three Alls\" policy, attempting to exterminate all of our people. In total, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits slaughtered more than 40,000 people, raped more than 100,000 women, and burned and looted countless properties in Central China over the past year. But the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' failure lies here, because they do not want the people, they want to kill all the people, while the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army protect the people and help the people to turn over, so wherever the Chiang Kai-shek army burns and kills, the flames of people's guerrilla warfare will burn.\n\n　　From January to March 1947, large-scale guerrilla warfare unfolded throughout Central China, from the Longhai Railway in the north to the Yangtze River in the south, and from the Jinpu Railway in the west. Even children and old women were involved in the struggle. Chen, a 70-year-old grandmother in the Huai'an border area, performed the heroic act of sacrificing her son and destroying her house in order to rescue nine guerrillas. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits concentrated their forces to \"encircle and suppress\" our central area, we immediately inserted ourselves into the enemy's heart, sweeping away their old nests, and successively annihilated more than 9,300 enemies along the Huai(an)-Lian(shui) line and in Nantong, Haimen and other places. At the same time, mass political offensives were combined with anti-conscription, anti-taxation, anti-burning and killing, and anti-rape, and movements such as \"torch parades,\" \"wiping out black spots,\" \"stubborn family meetings,\" and \"writing letters to Chiang Kai-shek soldiers\" were launched to win over and disintegrate more than 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits. However, due to the disparity in strength between the enemy and us at that time, we did encounter great difficulties in persisting: there was a stronghold every two or three miles in the \"encirclement and suppression\" area, and the highway bunkers were sealed off layer by layer. When the troops from northern and southern Huai penetrated deep behind the Chiang Kai-shek lines, they were followed and \"pursued and suppressed\" by eight regiments of enemies, eating only one meal a day and night, fighting several times a day and marching hundreds of miles at night, but not only were they not scattered by the enemy, but they also annihilated more than 6,000 enemies. Therefore, although the Chiang Kai-shek bandits occupied some of our areas in these three months, they could not extinguish our vital forces. At the end of March and the beginning of April, the enemy concentrated more than 60,000 troops from the 49th Division, the 4th Division, and local bandits to \"encircle and suppress\" the area south of the Hai(an)-Tai(zhou) line and Baoying, Gaoyou, Jiangdu, Qintong and other places along the Grand Canal, and advanced towards our central areas such as Xinghua and north of Dongtai, but just as they were being blocked by the flames of guerrilla warfare, the iron fist of our main force had already struck into the Hai(an)-Tai(zhou) line, captured the strong stronghold of Libao, and annihilated more than 2,700 men of the 49th Division. And when the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were in a hurry to transfer reinforcements to the Hai(an)-Tai(zhou) line, our main force annihilated an enemy regiment at Dazhongji and captured the important town of Baiju on the Tong(zhou)-Yu(tai) road, smashing the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' comprehensive \"encirclement and suppression\" of central Jiangsu. Our local armed forces took advantage of the enemy's chaos to launch extensive and comprehensive attacks, and the mass self-defense movement was also in full swing. Rugao, Taixing and other counties broke out in heroic acts of 100,000 people surrounding strongholds, and Rudong and other counties launched the \"one person killed, ten thousand people avenge\" movement, and the masses in the border areas also launched anti-donation and anti-cutting green struggle. In northern Jiangsu, just as the enemy concentrated its forces to \"encircle and suppress\" the counties south of the Longhai Railway, our main force and local armed forces jointly launched a fierce attack on their flanks, capturing many strongholds on the Shu(yang)-Huai(yin) line and the Lian(shui)-Xin(Anzhen) line, annihilating nearly a thousand enemies, and the enemy's \"encirclement and suppression\" plan was completely shattered. From April to mid-July, our annihilation of bandits increased to more than 20,000. We established a favorable situation of persisting behind enemy lines and recovered large areas of lost territory, while the enemy began to decline.\n\n　　From August, our army turned to strategic counter-offensive, becoming a flank of the southern counter-offensive army. On August 12, the Liberation Army recovered Yeting City in one fell swoop, annihilating more than 7,000 bandits and disrupting the entire deployment of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' \"encirclement and suppression\" of Central China. The comprehensive \"encirclement and suppression\" had turned into a complete standstill, and even the struggling \"encirclement and suppression\" and \"sweeping\" were limited to local areas and were merely economic plundering. Then our army swept north and south, captured Xin'anzhen and other places in October, and returned south on November 31 to recapture Libao, sweeping away all strongholds within 150 miles of the line. Local armed guerrillas everywhere coordinated their attacks, successively removing more than 70 strongholds, annihilating more than 9,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the entire battle. The peasants who had turned over and been persecuted by the enemy's repeated \"encirclement and suppression\" shouted in unison: \"The counter-offensive has begun, the day of revenge has arrived!\" Millions of people acted together, took up all their hoes and rakes, and leveled all the traffic blockades to the ground. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits' defense system in central Jiangsu was smashed to pieces, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits shrank into isolated strongholds, panicking. At the same time, our troops from northern Huai successively captured Siyang County and dozens of large and small strongholds, recovering large areas of lost territory in Suining, Siling Sui, Ding Fengjia, Siyang, and Wuhe counties, which had been lost for a year, liberating a population of one million. Southern Huai has also penetrated into the Tianchang area south of Hongze Lake and is developing in depth. From August to the present five months, our annihilation of bandits has jumped to 50,000.\n\n　　Through a year of heroic fighting by the army and the people, we have paid a heavy price and achieved brilliant results. A total of 82,400 Chiang Kai-shek bandits were annihilated, and 118 artillery pieces and 21,645 machine guns and rifles were captured. Now we control eight tenths of the countryside and two thirds of the towns, restoring the situation before the \"encirclement and suppression.\" The reporter finally pointed out: \"In the coming year, the army and people of Central China will complete the comprehensive large-scale counter-offensive mission in the Central China region, recover all towns and cities, and completely and thoroughly eliminate all Chiang Kai-shek bandits.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华中战局由坚持转入反攻　记者评述一年军事形势\n\n1948-01-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华中战局由坚持转入反攻\n  　记者评述一年军事形势\n    【新华社华东七日电】华中分社记者此次评述华中一年来军事斗争形势称：一年来华中的军事斗争是从胜利坚持到胜利反攻。\n    一九四六年底威胁蒋匪心脏的华中解放区已完全处于敌后。敌集中兵力最多时达正规军二十个旅，连保安队等达二十万人，对这一地区进行毫无人性，惨绝人性的全面“清剿”。其部署是：南线以苏中沿江的泰兴、泰州、靖江、如皋、南通、启东、海门等为据点，北线以陇海线以南之东海、灌云、沭阳、宿迁等为据点，中线以运河线之泗阳、淮阴、淮安、宝应、高邮、溱潼等为据点，西线以运河线以西津浦线以东之淮南淮北为据点，互相配合，反复包围合击，妄图达到完全控制华中之阴谋。且进行三光政策，欲灭绝我全体人民。总计蒋匪一年来在华中屠杀人民四万余，强奸妇女十万余，烧毁房屋及掠劫财物则不计其数。但蒋匪的失败也就在这里，因为他不要人民，要杀尽人民，而共产党解放军则保护人民，帮助人民翻身，因此蒋军烧杀到哪里，人民游击战的烽火就燃烧到哪里。\n    一九四七年一月至三月，北起陇海、南抵长江、西至津浦整个华中全面展开了规模巨大的游击战争，连小孩和老太婆都卷入了斗争。淮安边区七十岁陈老奶奶为了营救九个游击队员，作了舍子毁屋的壮举。当蒋匪集中兵力“清剿”我中心区时，我即插入敌心脏，扫除其老窠，先后在淮（安）涟（水）线，南通、海门等地歼敌九千三百余。同时群众性的政治攻势与反抽丁、反捐税、反烧杀、反奸淫等结合，开展“火炬游行”，“擦黑点”，“顽属会议”及“写蒋军家书”等运动，争取瓦解蒋匪达三千余人。但由于当时敌我力量悬殊，在坚持中我确也碰到极大困难：“清剿”区中二三里路即有一个据点，公路碉堡层层封锁。淮北、淮南子弟兵深入蒋后，曾被八个团敌人跟着“追剿”，一天一夜只吃一顿饭，日战数次，夜行百里，但不仅没有被敌人打散，而且歼敌六千余名。因此这三个月中蒋匪虽然占了我某些地区，但却不能扑灭我有生力量。三月尾四月初敌人集中了四十九师、四师及土顽等六万余兵力向海泰、海＠线以南及运河沿线之宝应、高邮、江都、溱潼等地“清剿”，并向我兴化、东台以北等中心地区跃进，但正当其被阻于游击烽火时，我主力的铁拳已打入海＠线拿下强大据点李堡，歼敌四十九师二千七百余人。而当蒋匪慌忙调援海＠线时，我主力又于大中集歼敌一个团，并克通榆路上白驹重镇；将蒋匪对苏中的全面“清剿”打得七零八落。我地方武装更乘敌慌乱之际，广泛的全面出击，群众性自卫运动亦如火如荼，如皋、泰兴等县都爆发了十万群众包围据点的壮举，如东等县展开“一人被杀，万人复仇”运动，边沿区群众亦纷纷展开反捐、反割青斗争。在苏北，正当敌集中兵力“清剿”陇海路以南各县时，我主力及地武乃联合猛击其侧背，连克沭（阳）淮（阴）线及涟（水）新（安镇）线之据点多处歼敌近千，敌之“清剿”计划遂全部粉碎。自四月到七月中，我歼匪增至二万余人。确立了坚持敌后的有利形势，恢复了大块失地，而敌人则开始走下坡路。\n    从八月起，我军转入战略反攻，成为南线反攻大军的一个侧翼。八月十二日解放军一举收复叶挺城，歼匪七千余人还把蒋匪对华中“清剿”的整个部署打得零落不堪，全面“清剿”已变成全面停顿，就是还有一些挣扎性的“清剿”“扫荡”，亦仅限于局部地区，并且仅属经济性的掠夺罢了。接着我大军即向南北扫荡，十月攻克新安镇等地，十一月三十一日回师南下再克李堡，并扫平该线一百五十里内所有据点，各地地方武装游击队到处配合出击，接连拔除据点七十余，全役共歼蒋匪九千余人。被敌反复“清剿”所逼害的翻身农民此时众口一声喊着：“反攻了，复仇的日子到了”，千万人一齐行动，拿起所有的锄头、钉耙，把所有交通封锁线平毁一光，敌人在苏中的防御体系、被打得稀烂，蒋匪龟缩孤立据点，惶惶不安。同时，我淮北子弟兵连克泗县县城及大小据点数十处，恢复沦陷一年之睢宁、泗灵睢、盯凤嘉、泗县、五河等县大块失地，解放人口达一百万。淮南也已插入洪泽湖以南天长一带，并向纵深发展。从八月到现在的五个月，我歼匪跃至五万人。\n    经过一年来军民的英勇战斗，我们付出了重大的代价，而获得了辉煌的战绩。共歼蒋匪八万二千四百余人，缴获各种炮一百一十八门，机步枪二万一千六百四十五支。现我控制乡村十分之八，市镇三分之二，恢复到“清剿”以前的态势。记者最后指出：今后“年华中军民将在华中地区完成全面的大举反攻任务，收复一切城镇，干净彻底消灭一切蒋匪。"

    "content": "Right-leaning sentiments swept away\n    —— Three months of guerrilla warfare in Qi County\n    ·Jiang Sen·\n            The situation before September 4th\n    Qi County, once the old nest of local bandits in northern Henan like Hu Quanlu and Yang Fu, was liberated by the People's Liberation Army's spring offensive. However, after the main force of the People's Liberation Army transferred, the remnant bandits re-occupied villages such as Da Lizhuang, Xigang, and Yumin as a base for continuing to rule the people of Qi County, achieving their ambition to restore the landlord regime. After a period of organization and preparation, the enemy restored its broken landlord-special agent ruling system, colluding openly and secretly, using superstition and deception, developing secret societies, and infiltrating our internal affairs. Starting with the Baotun incident on August 20th, they began to attack the democratic regime. The Shangcao incident on the 24th and robberies in Lihetun, Mazhuang, Guanzhuang, and the city occurred successively, affecting even Miaokou, which was a base area during the Anti-Japanese War, causing tension. Some cadres in various agencies fled in panic. The government of the Third District went into exile, and the First, Second, Fifth, and Sixth Districts fled to the mountains, some even going up the mountains. The leadership initially considered these to be isolated small matters, but the situation continued to develop, cadres were panicked, the masses were either neutral or panicked, and the leadership's thinking also became chaotic.\n    Why did this situation occur? Was the enemy powerful? The answer is definitely no! It was because there were shortcomings in our leadership and work itself. The assessment and understanding of the current situation in northern Henan and the feudal bandit forces remaining in northern Henan were insufficient. The leadership's thinking, cadres' thinking, and the masses became paralyzed, waiting for the main force to counterattack. Work was resisted by these ideas, unified leadership was weak, forces were not concentrated, guerrilla warfare was relaxed, or even abandoned. When distributing land, no assistance was given to the poor and hired laborers to arm themselves, saying \"the poor and hired laborers are too honest,\" or the poor and hired laborers were not mobilized, and the arms were handed over to the landlords and local bullies. Some people even created a theory saying: \"It is impossible to launch land reform without taking Qimen.\" They lingered and turned in the circle of \"three insurances,\" giving the landlord and bully regime a chance to revive.\n    　　　　Clarify the policy and arm ourselves to open up the situation\n    The leadership studied and reviewed the above situation, accepted the instructions of the prefectural committee on the policy of \"the enemy advances, we advance; the enemy does not advance, we also advance\" to develop guerrilla warfare, and the characteristics of land reform in the border area and the KMT-controlled area of \"holding a gun in one hand and distributing land in the other,\" broke through all obstacles, unified the thinking of cadres, clarified the policy, concentrated the forces that could be concentrated, and began to counterattack the offensives launched by the Chiang bandits, local bullies and landlords.\n    　　　　Yang bandit Wang Xianwen's detachment was annihilated\n    On September 4th, six routes of the army marched into Da Lizhuang, Xigang, Yumin, Hekou, Da Checun, Shihe and other villages, hitting the bank of the Wei River. On the night of September 4th, the 49th unit annihilated the Yang Fu and Wang Xianwen detachment stationed in Da Lizhuang, while at the same time, the puppet bandits in Xigang, Yumin and other strongholds fled in panic. By the 5th, there was no trace of the enemy in the entire county.\n    On the 6th, after repelling the counterattack by Gao Yongqing and other \"secret society\" troops of more than 300 people, local armed forces were organized in coordination with Hua County to carry out a pursuit operation. On the night of the 10th, an attack was launched on the three strongholds of Wei Xianji, Gongtang, and Juqiao in Hua County. The puppet bandits were defeated and fled. The Li Fang work team intercepted the fleeing enemies in Jinzhuang, killing and wounding five of them, and seizing one machine gun. In this period, a total of 61 bandits of Yang and Hu were annihilated, 60 local bullies and landlords were captured alive, one machine gun, 36 rifles, three grenade launchers, and many other military supplies were seized.\n    　　　　Launch the capture, autumn distribution, and land distribution movement\n    The 49th Unit and district cadres occupied Hekou, Doujie, Dachecun, and other places with sudden action, blocking the escape routes of scattered bandits and local bullies. Cadres, militiamen, work teams, and a powerful capture team organized by 600 farmers, an armed turn-over team, were distributed in eight mopping-up areas including Da Lizhuang, Xigang, and Yumin. Using methods such as large encirclements and class standing teams, they launched a sweeping movement of destroying bandit nests, digging out bandit eggs, and moving stones, and more than a thousand local bullies and landlords were caught within seven days. Within nine days, the masses in forty-four administrative villages distributed more than 2,700 dan of landlord grain, 8,900 mu of land, 250 head of livestock, and more than 45,000 pieces of agricultural implements.\n    　　　playerCards Battle of Chengguan\n    The sweeping autumn distribution and land distribution movement has already been booming, but the argument that \"struggle cannot be carried out without taking Qimen\" still exists in the minds of some comrades, who doubt this movement. Some comrades even said: \"Confiscation and distribution are like burning straw, it will be over soon.\" Some said: \"There are no activists, the poor and hired laborers are too honest, and dare not take the lead...\" and so on, shouting in the autumn distribution and land distribution movement. The leadership strictly proposed an examination of this kind of resistance movement's argument, tracing the root cause to: \"Saying in the meeting to support the masses and be their master, but staying during the day and leaving at night. The active elements were discovered in Yumin Chengguan on the first day, and they disappeared the next day. They felt that we were not their backers, coupled with the rumors of special agents and bad guys.\" The real reason was all found, that is, some cadres did not stick to the position with the masses, but fled to the right. At this point, the cadres from top to bottom resolved this problem, and resolved to stick to the position with the masses. Enemy bandits attacked our mopping-up and land distribution movement from the outside. On September 20th, they organized more than 200 people to attack Chengguan. More than 40 militiamen stationed in Chengguan resolutely resisted on the spot, and after smashing three enemy offensives, they cooperated with the militia support team led by District Chief Yan to drive away the enemy and protect the land distribution movement.\n    　　　　Right-leaning sentiments swept away\n    The masses in Xigang, Huangdui, Jiangzhuang and other villages, who did not dare to approach us at all in the past, now treat us like relatives when they see us, inviting us to their homes for meals and telling us about the affairs of the village. In Shizhuang, Liangxiang and other villages, when enemy situation was discovered, the masses retreated. When the masses in Huangdui discovered the enemy situation, they sent three reports to the district office thirteen li away within half a day. Three farmers in Jiangzhuang volunteered to go to Wei Xianji, where no one dared to go, to scout the enemy's situation. When our army crossed the Wei River to attack the bandit nests, the masses in Dongqiao and Shifosi, after hearing this, automatically took out tables and door panels to build bridges. The masses took off their clothes and went into the icy water as bridge legs to let their army pass.\n    Right-leaning sentiments have been washed away by the waves of the mass movement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 右倾情绪扫光了——淇县三个月的游击战争\n姜森\n1948-01-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　右倾情绪扫光了\n    ——淇县三个月的游击战争\n    ·姜森·\n            九月四号以前的情况\n    曾经是豫北惯匪扈全禄、杨富等老巢的淇县，被人民解放军春季攻势解放了。但是人民解放军主力转移后，该匪残部复又攻占大李庄、西岗、迂民等村，作为继续统治淇县人民的根据地，达到其恢复地主政权的野心。敌人经过一段组织准备，恢复其已被打碎了的地主特务统治连系，明的暗的串通起来，利用迷信和欺骗，发展会门，打入我内部。自八月二十日鲍屯事件起，开始向民主政权进攻了，接连着二十四日上曹事件及李河屯、马庄、关庄以及城里的抢案等事件发生，以致影响到抗日时期即为根据地的庙口都紧张起来。各机关干部有的慌乱逃跑，三区政府流亡，一、二、五、六区跑到山边，有的还上了山。领导上开始认为是些个别的小事，但情势继续发展着，干部恐慌，群众或中立或恐慌，领导思想亦混乱起来了。\n    为什么造成这样的局面呢？是敌人厉害吗？应该肯定的说不是！而是我们领导和工作本身有了缺点，对目前豫北的形势及残存在豫北的封建土匪武装估计认识不足，领导思想、干部思想以及群众麻痹起来了，等待着主力的反攻，工作受了这些思想的抵抗，统一领导无力，力量不集中，放松了游击战争，甚或放弃游击战争。分田不帮助雇贫武装起来，说什么“雇贫太老实”，或者不发动雇贫，把武装交到地主奸霸手里，有的人并制造出一种理论说：“不打下淇门，发动分田是不可能的。”而在“三保险”的圈子里徘徊兜转，给奸霸地主政权以死灰复燃的机会。\n    　　　　明确方针武装打开局面\n    领导上研究检讨了上述情况，接受了地委关于“敌进我进、敌不进我亦进”的开展游击战争方针，和边地、蒋管区“一手持枪、一手分田”土地改革特点的指示，冲破一切阻碍，统一干部思想，明确方针，集中了所能集中的力量，对蒋匪奸霸地主所发动的攻势开始反攻。\n    　　　　杨匪王显文中队被歼灭\n    九月四日，六路大军进发大李庄、西岗、迂民、河口、大车村、石河等村，打到卫河边岸。九月四日夜，四九部队把驻守大李庄的杨富、王显文中队歼灭，而同时西岗、迂民等据点伪匪闻风逃窜。至五日全县没有敌人踪影。\n    六日，击退了“会队”高永清等部三百余人的反扑后，配合滑县地方武装组织了追击作战，于十日夜间出击滑县之魏贤集、公堂、聚桥等三据点，伪匪受创溃逃。李芳武工队于靳庄截击逃敌，毙伤其五名，缴机枪一挺，此段前后共计歼灭“会队”杨、扈匪六十一名，活捉奸霸地主六十名，缴获机枪一挺，步枪三十六支，掷弹筒三个，及其他军用品很多。\n    　　　　展开捕捉分秋分田运动\n    四九部队及区干部以突然动作，占领了河口、豆街、大车村等，堵住散匪奸霸的逃路，干部民兵武工队及六百农民组织的强大捕捉队，武装翻身队，分布在大李庄、西岗、迂民等八个清剿地区内，用大包围、划阶级站队等方法展开了捣匪巢，掏匪蛋、搬石头的一扫光运动，七天之内有千余奸霸地主落网。四十四个行政村九天之内，群众分得地主粮食两千七百余石，土地八千九百亩，牲口二百五十头，农具四万五千多件。\n    　　　　城关战斗\n    一扫光分秋分田运动已经轰开了，但是“不打下淇门斗争不能搞”的论调，仍在某些同志头脑里存在着，怀疑这一运动。有些同志甚至这样说：“没收分配是把茅草火、过去就完了。”有的说：“没有积极分子，雇贫太老实，不敢带头………”等，在分秋分田运动里喊叫。领导上对这种抵抗运动的论调，严格的提出检查，追出根源是：“开会说给群众撑腰作主，但白天在、夜里走。迂民城关头天发现积极分子，第二天跑的不见了，他们感到我们不是靠山，再加上特务坏蛋的造谣。”真实原因全部找到了，这就是有些干部没有和群众一块坚持阵地，右倾逃跑。至此干部自上而下解决了这一问题，决心和群众一起坚持阵地。敌匪对我清剿分田运动，从外部打进来，九月二十日组织二百余人进攻城关，我驻在城关的四十多个民兵，就地坚决抵抗，粉碎敌人三次冲锋后，配合阎区长率领之支援民兵队，把敌人打跑了，保卫了分田运动。\n    　　　　右倾情绪扫光了\n    从前根本不敢接近我们的西岗、黄堆、姜庄等村群众，现在见了我们就象亲人一样，招呼叫到自己家里吃饭，告说村里的事情。史庄、良相等村，发现敌情，群众就退却了，黄堆群众发现敌情，半天内向十三里外的区公所送三次情报，姜庄三个农民自报奋勇到无人敢去的魏贤集侦察敌人情况。我军过卫河出击匪巢，东桥、石佛寺群众听说自动把桌子、门板拿出搭桥，群众脱下衣服下到冰冷的水里当桥腿，让自己的军队过去。\n    右倾的情绪，被群众运动的浪头冲洗了。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 6th. The Harbin municipal organs' streamlining movement has concluded after more than two months of democratic discussion and has now begun to transition into a party rectification movement. At the beginning of the streamlining, Comrade Li Fuchun of the Northeast Bureau made a mobilization report, pointing out that this streamlining is very different from the \"streamlining administration and better troops\" campaign during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Today, it is to win the victory of large-scale warfare, build a strong and powerful rear area, advocate a hardworking and simple work style, and extensively carry out the movement to save money to support the front. Subsequently, streamlining committees were established according to each system and unit, and democratic conferences were held, adopting a precise calculation method to examine the work of their own departments, and actively put forward opinions to other units. Then, the responsible comrades of each organ formulated a draft establishment plan, which was submitted to the Northeast Bureau for unified regulations. The regulations were issued by the Central Bureau a few days ago, mainly including the following: reduce overlapping layers, re-examine the original establishment of the unit, reduce unnecessary personnel, and advocate that one person do the work of several people. Except for the heads of the Northeast Bureau who are required to handle confidential documents and are allowed to have one secretary, no one else is allowed to have a personal secretary. Except for the heads stipulated by the Northeast Bureau, other cadres should not use bodyguards. Cadres using orderlies should uniformly change to five people sharing one orderly. Female comrades who participate in work at or above the regimental or county level with one or two children under the age of five can be assigned one nanny; those with three children under the age of five can add one orderly. Female comrades below the county and regimental level who participate in work with one child will share a nanny with another person; those who do not participate in work will not be equipped with a nanny if they have only one child, and those with two children under the age of five can be equipped with one nanny. Each system should establish kindergartens and nurseries under possible conditions to enable female cadres to participate in work and production. In terms of the living system, the supply standards should be strictly observed. The treatment of all cadres must be based on the living standards of middle peasants in the countryside and technical workers in the city, and must not exceed them. Regarding rooms and residences, except for the few top leaders decided by the Northeast Bureau, the rest should be merged with the organs, and no individual residences should be allowed. Unmarried individuals below the section chief level should live together, and all surplus houses should be returned to the public. Regarding transportation, except for a few leaders stipulated by the Northeast Bureau who can be equipped with a car due to work relations, other cadres can adopt a public long-term tram ticket system. All organs should cancel cigarette provisions for hospitality. Meetings and conversations should calculate time to avoid providing meals whenever possible. For entertainment, in addition to evening parties organized by organs and cultural troupes, each organ's personnel are only allowed to watch movies in an organized manner once every half month; those who watch movies at other times will be investigated and punished. The work and study system uniformly implements a ten-hour work and study system, with eight hours of work and two hours of study every day, and uniformly stipulates the time. Office work is also required on Sunday mornings, and discussion meetings can be held in the afternoon. Outgoing personnel must ask for leave, and no visitors are allowed during office hours without special reasons. In order to implement the above system, the Northeast Bureau specially convened a joint conference of all general branches, emphasizing that each branch should mobilize the entire party to make guarantees and conduct regular inspections and supervision. Now all organs have complied with the implementation, and at the same time are carrying out anti-corruption and launching a savings movement, gradually transitioning to the party rectification stage.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 哈尔滨市各机关开展整党运动  提倡艰苦朴实的工作作风\n\n1948-01-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　哈尔滨市各机关开展整党运动\n    提倡艰苦朴实的工作作风\n    【新华社东北六日电】哈市各机关整编运动经两个多月的民主讨论现已结束，并开始转入整党运动。整编开始时，曾由东北局李富春同志作动员报告，指出此次整编与抗战时精兵简政有很大的不同，今天是为了争取大规模战争的胜利，必须建设强大有力的后方，提倡艰苦朴实的工作作风，广泛开展节约支前运动。随即按各系统及各单位分别成立整编委员会，举行民主大会，采取精密计算的方式，检查自己部门的工作，同时并向旁的单位积极提出意见，然后由各该机关负责同志订定编制草案，汇交东北局，作出统一规定。该规定已于日前由中央局发布，主要的有下列各项：减少重叠层次，重新审查本单位的原定编制，裁减不必要的人员，提倡一个人做几个人的事。除东北局规定有机要文件来往的首长设秘书一人外，其他任何人不得设个人秘书。除东北局规定之首长外，其余干部亦一律不用警卫员。使用勤务员的干部，一律改为五人共用一公务员。女同志本人在团、县级以上参加工作者有五岁以下小孩一个或两个，可配一保姆，有五岁以下之小孩三个，可增加勤务员一人。县、团级以下之女同志参加工作而有一个小孩者，二人共一保姆，不参加工作的只有一个小孩不配备保姆，有五岁以下小孩两个可配备保姆一人。各系统在可能条件下应设立幼稚团、托儿院，使妇女干部参加工作与生产。生活制度方面应严格遵守供给标准，一切干部待遇务须做到以农材中之中农与城市里的技术工人生活为标准，不得超过。房间住所，除东北局决定之几个最高负责人外，其余一律应与机关合并，不得有个人住宅。科长以下未结婚者几人合住，多余房屋一律退交公家。交通用具除东北局规定的少数首长因工作关系可备汽车一辆外，其余干部可采用公用长期电车票制。各机关招待烟，一律取消。开会和谈话要计算时间，做到尽量不开客饭。娱乐除机关及文工团组织的晚会外，每半月各机关人员只许有组织的看电影一次，其余时间看电影者查出处罚。工作与学习制度一律实行十小时工作、学习制，每天八小时工作，二小时学习，并统一规定时间。星期日上午亦须办公，下午可举行学习讨论会。外出人员必须请假，办公时间内无特殊原因者不许会客。东北局为了贯彻上述制度，特召开各总支联合会，强调各支部应动员全党进行保证，并经常进行检查与监督。现各机关均已遵照执行，同时并进行反贪污与开展节约运动，逐步转入整党阶段。"

Afterwards, they fought all the way to the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, established large new liberated areas, helped poor peasants to turn over, carried out land and grain distribution, expanded the ranks, and organized militia. Chiang Kai-shek was terrified when he saw this and hurriedly scraped together some broken-down troops to \"sweep\" them up. In the past twenty days, they have been battered by General Liu Bocheng's troops, eliminating more than 1,800 of them and capturing fourteen county towns in one go.

    "content": "Taihang Supplementary Fourth Regiment Sues for Grievances and Digs Up Roots\n    Landlords Killed Parents and Wives; They Lifted Stone Slabs to Avenge their Enemies\n    [Our News] The Taihang Supplementary Fourth Regiment, after \"contributing ideas and resolving knots,\" with soldiers from poor peasant and hired laborer backgrounds as the backbone, launched a grievance-airing and root-digging movement starting on the 16th. Comrade Zhou Chengzhang of the Guard Company said: \"I remember when my grandfather was alive, he had nothing to eat and starved to death. My father initially begged for food, and later became a long-term laborer for a wealthy man and was poisoned to death by the landlord. My fifth younger brother suffered outside. The landlord insisted on treating him like an adult, paying him wages according to a child's labor. He hated the landlord in his heart, developed sores, and died of anger. Seeing that life was unbearable, my mother starved and froze, ate little, and wore nothing. She hardened her heart and strangled two younger siblings to death, becoming a wet nurse for the landlord to make a living. Our family of five was starved to death, forced to death, and angered to death by the landlord.\" He burst into tears after finishing his story. Comrade Jia Heqing sadly recounted his grievances, saying: \"My grandmother had a difficult life in the past. She had nothing to eat, nothing to wear, and no house to live in. She cooked for the rich man and worked as a servant. When she got old, the landlord kicked her out to beg for food, and she starved to death later. The hateful landlord refused to let her be buried in the grave. I took over the rich man's dilapidated house, but I didn't have the money to pay him, so I was kicked out again and lived in the temple. My father still begged for food, and my mother threw the baby, who was not even a month old, off the cliff to its death.\"\n    The soldiers had wives forced away by landlords, were worked to death as long-term laborers, had fathers forced to death and not allowed to be buried, had to beg for food for three generations, had to repay nine shi for borrowing one shi, had landlords who let dogs eat dumplings but not the poor, were forced to flee famine and sell their children, and starved to death... There were too many painful things. In airing grievances in each class, everyone cried bitterly. Many comrades couldn't continue speaking when they reached the painful parts, and the comrades recording couldn't continue writing.\n    After airing grievances, statistics showed that 768 parents, siblings, and children were forced to death, starved to death, frozen to death, angered to death, beaten to death, or poisoned to death by the landlord class. The families of the soldiers of the First Battalion had 214 people killed by the landlords, 60 people forced to be sold, and another 13 children forced to death. 401 houses were seized, 730 mu of land, 64 head of livestock, 62 sheep, 800 pieces of furniture, farm implements, and clothing, and 15,000 jin of grain. The families of the soldiers of the First Company had 20 people killed by the landlords, 23 starved to death, 44 forced to death, 18 missing, 10 child brides, and 13 children given away because they could not afford to raise them. 17 women from the families of the soldiers of the Thirteenth Company were raped by landlords.\n    During the airing of grievances, everyone's class consciousness was raised. They clearly realized that the suffering was given by the landlord class, and that without overthrowing the landlords and the landlord's root, Chiang Kai-shek, they and their class brothers could not thoroughly turn over. Some people who had ideological barriers when joining the army also understood at this time. Li Youqing, the Ninth Squad Leader of the Third Company, said: \"I begged for food for three generations and was driven out of the village by the landlord. My aunt was thrown into the river and drowned, and my uncle was angered to death. I cannot forget my family's history of suffering. I wanted to desert when I came, and I prepared a pass. I forgot my roots and was not worthy of being called a human being. From now on, I will study hard.\" Under the new understanding, all the soldiers enlightened and checked each other and contributed many passes. Everyone was determined to fight to the Yangtze River to liberate the poor brothers in the Chiang-controlled areas.\n    On the 28th, each battalion held a memorial and revenge rally to mourn the 768 parents, siblings, and children who died in the disaster. All officers and soldiers wore a mourning flower on their chests. On the altar were the spiritual tablets of the victims. Everyone recalled the past suffering and shed tears. Wang Zhi of the Third Battalion said at the altar: \"My family used to have no house or land. My parents and brothers were forced to death by the landlord. Now only I am left. I will resolutely avenge my parents. I have joined the army three or four times, but I have not been approved. This time, I must fight to Nanjing, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and avenge my hatred. I have made a plan to ensure that I will complete it. First, I will learn the skills of killing the enemy militarily and politically. Second, I will not violate mass discipline and will serve the masses to the end, uncovering the stone slabs for the class brothers. Third, I guarantee that I will not desert, will not be captured, will exercise my body, and will not fall behind on the march. Fourth, I will obey the leadership, listen to commands, learn from each other, and complete the task. Fifth, I will kill ten enemies at the front.\" Comrade Kang Zhirong said simply: \"My parents were forced to death by the puppet Baochang. This time, I volunteered to join the army to avenge my hatred. I will perform meritorious service for the people at the front, kill twenty enemies, capture twenty rifles and one machine gun, fight to Nanjing, and personally capture Chiang Kai-shek.\" The meeting ended in an atmosphere of \"turning grief into strength and never returning home without capturing the bandit Chiang.\" (Jiang Tao, Wang Zhenchao, He Wanhua)\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    (In the army, airing grievances and digging up old roots makes the soldiers realize the pain of the landlord class and Chiang Kai-shek forcing their parents and wives to death, causing their families to be destroyed. They will inevitably demand revenge. In addition to guiding them to study hard and practice martial arts to \"fight to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive,\" the leadership should also guide them to participate in the equal distribution of land, support the peasants, overthrow the landlords, and help the class brothers thoroughly turn over. -- Editor)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行补充四团诉苦刨根  地主害死父母妻子掀起石板大报冤仇\n江韬　王振朝　贺万华\n1948-01-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行补充四团诉苦刨根\n    地主害死父母妻子掀起石板大报冤仇\n    【本报消息】太行补充四团经过“献思想，解疙瘩”，全团由贫雇出身的战士当骨干，从十六号起展开诉苦刨老根运动。警卫连周成章同志说：“我记得祖父活着的时候就没啥吃，活活饿死了。父亲起初要饭，后来给老财当长工，被地主毒死了。俺五弟在外受苦，地主硬要当大人使唤，按孩子的劳力开给工钱。他心中痛恨地主，长疮气死了。俺娘看见时光实在没法过，挨饿受冻，少吃没穿，狠了狠心把弟妹二人掐死，给地主当奶妈糊口。俺一家被地主饿死、逼死、气死五口。”说完泪流满面。贾和庆同志悲痛的诉苦说：“俺奶奶过去时光困难，没吃没穿，没房子住。给老财做饭当小使。年纪大了，被地主撵出来要饭，后来就饿死了。可恨地主硬不叫往坟里埋。俺当了老财的破房子，没钱给人家，又被撵出来，住到庙里。父亲还是要饭，母亲把没有满月的孩子从崖上扔下来跌死。”\n    战士们被地主把老婆逼走的、当长工累死的、把父亲逼死不叫埋的、要三辈饭的、借一石还九石的、叫狗吃饺子不叫穷人吃的、被逼逃荒卖儿卖女的、饿死的………痛苦事情实在太多了。各班在诉苦中都是痛哭流涕，好多同志说到痛处说不下去，记录的同志也记不下去了。\n    诉苦后统计：被地主阶级逼死、饿死、冻死、气死、打死、毒死的父母兄弟姊妹有七百六十八人。一营战士的家属被地主害死的二百一十四人，逼卖的六十人，另外逼死小孩十三人。抢走房子四百零一间，地七百三十亩，牲口六十四头，羊六十二只，桌椅、农具、衣服八百件，粮食一万五千斤。一连战士家属被地主杀死廿人，饿死廿三人，逼死四十四人，失踪十八人，童养媳十人，养不起把小孩送给别人十三人。十三连战士家属妇女被地主强奸十七人。\n    诉苦中大家的阶级觉悟提高了。明确的认识了苦是地主阶级给的，不打倒地主和地主的老根蒋介石。自己和阶级弟兄不能彻底翻身。有些人参军时思想不通，这时也通了。三连九班长李有清说：“俺要了三辈子饭，被地主赶出村，把大娘扔在河里淹死，把大爷气死，我家的历史痛苦不能忘了。来时想开小差，准备了路条，我忘了本，不算人。从今以后要努力学习。”全体战士在新的认识下，互相启发检查献出了许多路条。大家都下决心打到长江边，解放蒋区穷弟兄。\n    二十八日，各营召开追悼复仇大会。追悼被难的七百六十八位父母兄弟姊妹。全体指战员每人胸前带哀花一朵，灵台上有被难者的灵位，大家回忆起过去的痛苦，流出了眼泪。三营王志的在灵台上说：“我家过去房无一间，地无一垄，父母和兄弟被地主逼死，现在只剩下我一人，我要坚决为父母报仇。我已参军三四次了，没有验上。这次一定要打到南京，活捉蒋介石，报仇雪恨。我订出了计划，保证一定完成。一、军事政治上学习杀敌本领。二、不违犯群众纪律，为群众服务到底，为阶级弟兄揭石板。三、保证不开小差，不当俘虏，锻炼自己身体，行军保证不掉队。四、服从领导听指挥，互相学习完成任务。五、到前方要杀十个敌人。”康志荣同志干脆的说：“我父母都是被伪保长逼死的，这次自愿参军报仇，到前方为民立功，杀二十个敌人，缴二十支步枪，一挺机枪，打到南京去，亲自下手捉住蒋介石。”会议在“把悲痛变为力量，捉不住蒋贼决不回家”的情绪中结束。（江韬、王振朝、贺万华）\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    （在部队里诉苦刨老根，战士们认识了地主阶级和蒋介石逼死自己的父母妻子，使得自己家破人亡的痛苦，必然要求报仇，领导上除了应该引导他们好好学习练武“打到南京去，活捉蒋介石”以外，还应该引导他们参加平分土地，支援农民，打倒地主，帮助阶级弟兄彻底翻身。——编者）"

An enemy company from the 50th Division of the New First Army that broke through was completely annihilated on the 21st near Dafangshen, Dehui, on the south bank of the Songhua River. The reporter pointed out: The recapture of this bridgehead stronghold with permanent fortifications foreshadows the fate of Jilin and Changchun. After the Chiang bandits occupied the Songhua River bridgehead in the past, they worked on top of the original fortifications, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to spend tens of billions of Chiang currency, using Japanese and American technology, to build eighty-odd permanent above-ground and underground bunker complexes, touting this small piece of land as an \"advance base to take Harbin in ten days\"; however, in just one year, the People's Liberation Army has moved south thousands of miles, and all the Chiang bandit remnants in isolated strongholds in the liberated areas now have only two futures: either surrender or be annihilated.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 7th.

On December 18th, our unit once again entered the villages of Dongfengfeng and Xifengfeng, west of Jiaozuo. The Chiang bandits fled without daring to resist, and we promptly destroyed all the enemy fortifications and pillboxes in Dongfengfeng Village. On the 20th, our Pinghan Detachment advanced into the enemy's rear, penetrating the Xiu(wu)-Huo(jia)-Wu(zhi) triangle area three times. We successively recovered more than ten strongholds, large and small, including Xieqiying, Xuying, Xuanyangyi, and Sungang. We also completely destroyed the Pinghan Railway section from ZhanDian to Zhongyi, north of Xinxiang, killing or wounding five enemy soldiers, capturing 109, seizing two machine guns, one 60mm mortar, more than 100 rifles, seven war horses, seven bicycles, and one telephone. The Chiang bandits entrenched in Huojia, Wuzhi, and the Yellow River Railway Bridge were terrified and had to ask the Chiang bandits entrenched in Jiaozuo and Xinxiang for help. On the same day, our Eastward Advance Detachment attacked the enemy stronghold in Yuba Village, southeast of Wuzhi on the bank of the Yellow River. The stationed enemy fled, and the puppet self-defense captain was captured. On the 21st, the militia rotation teams of the 3rd and 4th districts of Xiuwu ambushed the Chiang bandit transport team of the Zhengzhou Command, stationed in Xinxiang, at the Lihe Railway Station, ten miles east of Jiaozuo. Except for one enemy platoon leader who escaped, we captured more than 30 people, seized 39 mules, and suffered no casualties. On the evening of the 22nd, our unit raided Encun Village, five miles south of Jiaozuo, capturing one enemy soldier. On the 23rd, the unit launched a surprise attack on the south gate of Jiaozuo, capturing six Chiang puppet self-defense members and seizing six rifles. On the 24th, Wang Delin, the puppet bandit leader of Beizhu Village, personally led more than 1,000 bandit troops to attack our Xiaoliangzhuang (southwest of Jiaozuo), but was repelled by our Qinbo Column. More than 50 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, four were captured, and five rifles were seized. On the same day, two battalions of the Chiang bandit's 38th Division, combined with local puppet bandits, attacked Zhaowangxiang Village in our Xiu-Huo-Wu area. They were met with a head-on blow from our Pinghan Detachment, which killed or wounded more than 200 regular Chiang bandit soldiers, captured one enemy company commander, four platoon leaders, and five soldiers. On the evening of the 25th, a part of our Boqin Column captured ten puppet self-defense soldiers outside the south gate of Jiaozuo, seizing seven rifles, 438 rounds of ammunition, and liberating more than 20 conscripted laborers.

    "content": "The Poor Laborers Are Still Starving and Freezing\n    Implementing the Land Law is the Only Way to Meet Their Demands\n    Eight Poor Laborer Families Cannot Equal One Landlord Family\n    [Our News] In areas where land reform has not been thoroughly carried out, hired and poor peasants, rural workers, and all peasants with little or no land are still living in difficult conditions and urgently demand emancipation. The Outline Land Law of China completely meets their demands. The following are their voices and living conditions: Gao Huicheng, a long-term worker in Qianjing Village, Third District of Shahe, who has worked for twenty years, said: \"The cadres speak beautifully, but I know the situation in the village. Now the landlords Liu Tian Suo and Liu Bao Gui still have 28 mu of good land, and the Liu Xiaocheng family still has 70 mu of good land, three strings of good courtyards, and two donkeys. Eight of our poor laborer families are not worth one of their families. If it weren't for that, Liu Tian Suo's wife would have shouted in the street that their daughter is worth half a son, and I am worth one and a half sons (referring to getting protection and supplies by marrying a cadre).\" Zhang Liran, a poor laborer in Zhangyu Village, said: \"If the poor people in our village want to turn over, they still have to kill a fat pig and a fat sheep (meaning: to struggle against Zhang Jingshun, who has been a wealthy man in the village since the Ming Dynasty, now serving as a preferential treatment and resistance committee member, who has 70 mu of land, married two wives, and not only was not struggled against during the land reform but also received fruits, exchanging poor land for good land).\" Zhang Heidan said: \"This year I came back from Shanxi, and I have no house or land at home. The village distributed four mu of inferior land to me, divided into twelve pieces, which cannot be plowed.\" An old poor laborer in Zhonggao Village said: \"I worked as a long-term worker for more than twenty years and bought two mu of land. I and the landlord jointly dug a well (I invested), and jointly bought a waterwheel. This year, during the struggle, even my half was struggled away.\" Peng Ni, a poor laborer woman in Liugou Village, her husband starved to death in the famine years, leaving behind three children who survived by begging. Evaluator Geng Yin forced her to marry him, but she refused, so she was not given any fruits.\n\n　　　　Without Cotton Clothes and Quilts, Unable to Go Out to Engage in Production\n    In Heshun Tuanbi, Gaojiazhuang, Qingyangshu, and other nine villages, when the district arranged for winter production, it was found that many poor laborers and poor people had no quilts to cover and no cotton clothes to wear, and they could not go out at all. How could there be any winter production? The district cadres later went to the villages to investigate household by household and immediately found that more than 80 poor labor families had no cotton clothes and could not go out. Production funds were even more out of the question. The reason for the incomplete emancipation is that the landlords were not overthrown. During winter production, some bad cadres in the villages even lent money to those who were struggled against to open small shops. In Gaojiazhuang Village, 80,000 yuan was loaned, and middle peasants got half of it. The same situation exists in Xiyang. In Xipingyuan, Third District, poor laborer women automatically requested to spin and weave for the change of seasons, but they had no money and could not buy cotton. Now many women have not put on cotton clothes. The landlords and rich peasants are watching and making sarcastic remarks. For example, the rich peasant Tian Hu Niang落奚落 taunted the wife of poor laborer Wei Cun, saying: \"You have turned over, got fruits and learned to spin and weave, but you can't even wear clothes. I was struggled against, but I wear new clothes. Even if you get things that are not your own, you can't hold on to wealth.\" Tian Chuan Zhao Xiyun said: \"I am a widow and used to beg for seven or eight years. Now I am considered a human being, but I am still afraid of people. The women's association secretary and deputy secretary in our village are both big landlords of Hongshui. They only teach 'feudalism' when they engage in spinning and weaving. I wanted to learn, but they pushed me out. How can you not be angry? Later, when I went, they scolded me, saying: 'Society is elevating you now. You just picked up your beggar's shoes and you are a decent person.' I was so angry that I trembled all over, but I didn't dare to raise any objections in the past.\"\n\n　　　　About to Starve\n    Gaoyi County is a county with relatively more paddy fields. Although the harvest this year is not as good as in previous years, it is still stronger than counties like Lincheng and Zanhuang. The cadres have a blind optimism. This time, we investigated the lives of poor laborers and poor peasants in five villages: Dafuzhuang, Xiguan, Wangcun, Zhonghan, and Beijiao. We found that among the 324 households and 1,209 poor laborers in the five villages, 80 households and 286 people had no food at all. Only 56 households and 194 people could eat until February, only 50 households and 194 people could eat until March, 124 households and 508 people could eat until the wheat harvest, and only 14 households and 27 people could eat until autumn. Among the poor laborers in the five villages, only more than two out of every 100 people can eat until autumn.\n    We have published the voices of poor laborers separately from the contributions of our correspondents in order to help everyone more clearly understand the living conditions and demands of poor laborers. Many of our comrades shout \"rely on poor laborers\" and \"poor laborer concept\" every day, but they have never really lived with poor laborers, never had a heart-to-heart talk with them. They shout \"take poor laborers as the backbone for winter production\" every day, but the cooperatives and mutual aid groups are controlled by landlords and rich peasants, and the loans are still in their hands. How can poor laborers become the backbone? Lending to poor laborers in Xijiao Village, Pingle, should be right, but the poor laborers have not turned over. They say, \"I am worried about not being able to repay the loans I used to take out. How can I borrow this time?\" Therefore, without understanding the specific demands of hired and poor peasants, it is impossible to regard relying on hired and poor peasants, rural workers, and all peasants with little or no land as the fundamental class line, and of course, it is impossible to deeply understand the basic spirit of the Outline Land Law of China. We hope that comrades in various places will be spokespersons for hired and poor peasants and write about their lives and demands so that we can better serve hired and poor peasants.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 贫雇仍在挨饿受冻  执行土地法才能满足他们的要求  八个贫雇家换不了一个地主家\n\n1948-01-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　贫雇仍在挨饿受冻\n    执行土地法才能满足他们的要求 \n    八个贫雇家换不了一个地主家\n    【本报消息】土地改革做得不彻底的地方，雇贫农、乡村工人及一切少地无地的农民到现在生活都很困难，迫切要求翻身，中国共产党土地法大纲完全符合他们的要求，下面是他们的呼声和生活状况：沙河三区浅井村做过二十年活的长工高会成说：“干部们说的漂亮，全村情形俺知道，现在地主刘田锁、刘保贵还有二十八亩好地，刘小成家还有七十亩好地，三串好院子，两头驴，我们贫雇八户换人家一户，地主也是不换的，要不是那样，人家刘田锁老婆就在街上大喊了说，人家一个闺女半个儿，我是一个闺女一个半儿（指嫁给干部得到了掩护和供给）。”张峪村贫雇张立然说：俺村穷人要想翻身还得杀个肥猪肥羊（意思是说：要斗争该村从明朝以来就是财主的张景顺，现当优抗委员，他有七十亩地，娶两个老婆，在土地改革中不但没斗还分了果实，把赖地换成了好地）。张黑旦说：“今年我从山西回来，家中没房、没地，村上分给我四亩劣地，共十二块，不能犁。”中高村一个贫雇老汉说：“我做了二十多年长工买了二亩地，我和地主伙打了一眼井（我入人股），伙买了个水车，今年斗争时，连我那一半也斗走了。”柳沟村贫雇妇女彭妮，男人在灾荒年饿死了，留下三个孩子要饭活过来。评议员庚银的强迫和她结婚，她不愿意，就没有给她分任何果实。\n    　　　　没有棉衣被无法出门闹生产\n    和顺团壁、郜家庄、青杨树等九村，在区里布置下冬季生产时，发现有不少的贫雇穷人没有被子盖，没有棉衣穿，根本出不了门，那里能搞什么冬季生产？区干部后来到村里挨户调查，一下子就发现了有八十多家贫雇没棉衣不能出门，生产资金更谈不上了。翻身不彻底是由于地主没打倒，在冬季生产中村里一些坏干部竟把款贷给被斗户开小铺。郜家庄一村贷款八万元，中农就贷了一半。昔阳也有同样情形，三区西平原贫雇妇女自动要求纺织换季，可是没有钱，买不来棉花，现在有不少妇女没穿上棉衣，地主、富农在旁边看着说风凉话，譬如富农田虎娘落奚落贫雇魏存的老婆说：“你可翻了身啦，又得果实又学纺织，连衣裳也穿不上，我倒挨了斗争啦，穿的是新衣裳，不是自己的东西，得到手里也福不住财。”田川赵喜云说：“我是个寡妇，过去要饭七、八年，现在才算成了人，可是现在还怕人家。俺村妇女会正副秘书都是洪水的大地主，人家搞纺织，净教给“封建”，我想去学，人家把我推出来，你看气人不气人。后来去了，她们骂我说：“现在社会抬高你啦，刚揪起讨饭鞋后跟，就是正经人，气得我混身打颤，过去也不敢提意见”。\n    　　　　马上就要挨饿\n    高邑县是一个水地比较多的县份，今年收成虽不比往年，但比起临城、赞皇等县还是强的。干部们都存在着盲目的乐观情绪，这次调查了大夫庄、西关、王村、中韩、北焦等五村的贫雇农过的光景，发现五个村，三百二十四户，一千二百零九人的贫雇中；当下没吃的就有八十户、二百八十六人，能吃到二月的只五十六户一百九十四人，能吃到三月的只五十户共一百九十四人，能吃到麦收的一百二十四户五百零八人，能吃到秋天的只有十四户二十七人，五个村贫雇中一百个人中只有两个多人能吃到秋天。\n    我们从通讯员来稿中把贫雇农民的呼声单独的发表了，为的是帮助大家更清醒的认识贫雇的生活状况和要求，我们有不少同志嘴上天天喊“依靠贫雇”，“贫雇观念”，但从来没有真正同贫雇农民生活在一起，没有谈过一次知心话，天天喊：“以贫雇为骨干进行冬季生产”，可是，合作社、互助组被地主、富农把持了，贷款还掌握在人家手里，贫雇农又如何能成为骨干呢？平定西郊村贷款给贫雇，这应该是对的了吧，可是贫雇农没有翻身，他们说：“以前贷用的款，我都正发愁还不了啦，这次怎能贷？”所以，不了解雇贫农切身的要求，就不可能把依靠雇贫农乡村工人及一切少地无地农民当做根本的阶级路线，当然也就不会深刻地认识中国土地法大纲的基本精神。我们希望各地同志做雇贫农的代言人，写出他们的生活和要求，以便我们更好的为雇贫农服务。"

    "content": "Poor and Hired Laborers Did Not Rise Up, Winter Production Failed\n    Guowu Township's Fifth District Summary Lacks Class Character\n    [Wuxiang News] The secretary of the Fifth District Committee of Wuxiang and the district chief, together with several cadres, inspected the winter production work for the past month on the 29th of last month, and found that hired and poor laborers in some villages had not truly taken power. The district can be divided into three types of villages: The first type has more than ten villages, which are the best villages. Hired and poor laborers have actually taken power to lead mass production, and their enthusiasm is very high. For example, in Yuan Village, there are 82 female full and semi-laborers and 81 male full and semi-laborers. They started mutual aid production at the beginning of this month, organizing men to transport goods and engage in other side businesses. Women are weaving. In just 27 days, they have earned more than 2,066,600 yuan, with each labor group earning an average of 12,700 yuan. (Is it that some people are getting more and others are not getting enough? This calculation method is inappropriate. – Editor) This winter, they will not only be able to complete the county's requirement of earning an average of 20,000 yuan per laborer, but they are also confident of exceeding it. (Having production achievements and being able to complete tasks does not mean that hired and poor laborers have taken power. Have hired and poor laborers actually taken power? What are the specific manifestations? – Editor) At the same time, four or five very poor third-class villages were inspected, and the masses' enthusiasm for production was not high. The main reason is that cadres have turned the hired and poor laborers' taking power into formalism and a task-oriented view, failing to mobilize the hired and poor laborers ideologically and solve their specific difficulties, but instead bestowing favors and taking over everything. The production enthusiasm of middle peasants is also not high. For example, after the village cadres of Duan Village accepted the task of hired and poor laborers taking power from the district, they widely announced to the masses in the village that the hired and poor laborers are now in power and middle peasants cannot be cadres, and then considered the matter finished. (Simply handing over the task of mobilizing hired and poor laborers to organize production to the village cadres, and doing things badly, the leadership should also examine their own class stand and bureaucracy. – Editor) The hired and poor women in the village have no way to engage in winter production because they spend their days gathering firewood, boiling water, and pushing grindstones, but this is not being resolved. The village cadres and the masses go to chop firewood together. The masses all chop firewood, but the cadres return empty-handed. The cadres only shout slogans and do not actually solve the difficulties of the hired and poor laborers. Therefore, the hired and poor laborers cannot rise up, and the middle peasants do not move either. Zhang Baoyun, the chairman of the Wangjiagou Cooperative, is an old middle peasant. The cooperative cannot do things for the masses. However, when the comrades from the district went to the village to transform the leadership, they immediately convened the masses to elect a new leader without any mobilization. As a result, they elected Wu Jinshu, a hired and poor laborer, as the chairman of the cooperative. He is actually very good, but he has never managed village affairs and is too weak to dare to do anything. Because the masses had not been mobilized, they did not believe he could do it, and as a result, he was replaced in less than ten days. The cadres in Chengguan Village do not help the hired and poor laborers find ways to organize their production, but simply give them loans. The hired and poor laborers believe that if they take the money without doing anything, they will have to pay interest, so twelve hired and poor households dare not take the loans. In addition, some village cadres carry the burden of being veteran cadres and do not go deep into their work, so they cannot see the problems in the village. They always say that there are no problems in the village and that the production enthusiasm is very high, but after inspection, the difficulties of the hired and poor laborers have not been completely resolved. After research, the district cadres were all shocked and realized that there were many problems in the village. Therefore, they proposed to break with complacency and, instead of just shouting the hired and poor laborer line, to actually go deep into the hired and poor laborers, specifically solve practical difficulties, and continue to implement winter production.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Li Fang, Ruo Tao, Jin Ren)\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    What exactly is the problem with winter production? How to solve it? It is necessary to analyze it from the perspective of class character. Can breaking with complacency solve the problem? Are the difficulties of the hired and poor laborers simply that they have no time to produce because they are gathering firewood and pushing grindstones? Is it simply that they have no loans? Only criticizing village cadres and individual district cadres for not mobilizing the hired and poor laborers, and the leadership not truly understanding the situation of the hired and poor laborers, this kind of leadership method should first conduct self-criticism.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 贫雇没有抬头冬季生产落空　国武乡五区总结没有阶级性\n李芳　若涛　晋仁\n1948-01-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　贫雇没有抬头冬季生产落空\n    国武乡五区总结没有阶级性\n    【武乡消息】武乡五区分委书记和区长在上月二十九号和几个干部共同检查一月来的冬季生产工作，发现一部村雇贫并未真正掌权。全区可分三类村：第一类村有十余村，是最好村，雇贫实际上当了权领导群众生产，劲头很大。如原村全村女全半劳力八十二人，男全半劳力八十一人，从本月初开始互助生产，组织男人运输，并搞其他副业。女人纺织，到现在仅二十七天，共赚洋二百零六万六千余元，每组劳力平均赚洋一万二千七百元。（是不是有人得的多？还有人得不上？这样算法不妥当。——编者）。今冬不但能完成县里每个劳力平均赚洋两万元的要求，并且有把握的能超过。（生产有成绩，能完成任务并不等于雇贫掌了权。雇贫究竟掌权没有？具体的表现究竟是什么？——编者）同时也检查出四、五个很差的三等村，群众生产劲头不大，主要原因是干部把雇贫掌权变成形式主义和任务观点，不从思想上发动雇贫和具体解决雇贫困难，恩赐包办。中农生产情绪也不高。如段村村干部在区上接受了雇贫掌权，回村便广泛给群众宣布，现在是雇贫掌权，中农不能当干部，就算了事。（把发动雇贫组织生产的任务简单交给村干部，事情做坏了，领导上同样也要检查自己的阶级立场和官僚主义。——编者）该村雇贫妇女每天拾柴、烧水、推碾磨没法搞冬季生产不去解决。村干部和群众相跟去砍柴，群众都砍上柴，干部却是空回来。干部只是嘴上喊叫，不实际解决雇贫困难，因此雇贫起不来，中农也不动。王家沟合作社主席张保云是个老中农，合作社不能给群众办事，但区上同志去该村改造领导，不经过发动，马上召集群众选举，结果选了个雇贫武金书同志当合作社主席，实际很好，但是他自己没管过村里事，自弱的不敢干。群众因没有经过发动，也不相信他能干，结果没过十天又换了。城关村干部不给雇贫想办法组织他们生产，单纯的给雇贫贷款，雇贫认为拿上钱没做的又出利，就有十二户雇贫不敢要贷款。另外又有一部分村村干部背的是老资格包袱，不深入工作，因此看不出村里问题来。老说村里没问题，生产情绪很好，但经检查雇贫困难还没有彻底解决了。经研究后，区干部一致惊醒，村里问题很多，因此提出打破自满，与嘴上空喊雇贫路线，要实际深入雇贫，具体解决实际困难，继续贯彻冬季生产。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（李芳、若涛、晋仁）\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    冬季生产的问题究竟在那里？怎样解决？要从阶级性上去分析。打破自满是不是能解决问题？雇贫的困难是否就是拾柴推碾没功夫生产？是否就是没贷款？只批评村干部个别区干部不会发动雇贫，领导上又未去真正了解雇贫情况，这种领导方法应该自己首先做检查。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者"

    "content": "Zanhuang, Lincheng, Neiqiu and other counties\nWinter production did not follow the class line\n\n[Jixi News] The Taihang Prefectural Commissioner's Office recently convened county magistrates, chairmen of the Relief Associations, and directors of County Cooperative Societies to inspect winter production. Investigations from various locations revealed that many poor and hired peasants were still suffering from hunger and cold:\n\n(1) Who exactly is experiencing the disaster? In the past, the leadership in Zanhuang was not very clear on this. According to an investigation in Nanxule, there are 12 poor peasant households with 34 people, with 8.76 *shi* of grain. Each person has an average of only 2.57 *dou*. There are 13 middle peasant households (one old middle peasant) with 66 people, with 44.2 *shi* of grain. Each person has an average of 6.7 *dou*. In Dawangbang, an old area in Jingxing with serious disaster conditions, 17 old middle peasant households with 47 people have an average of 1.34 *shi* of grain per person, which, at a daily consumption of 0.5 *jin*, can last for one year and three months. 71 new middle peasant households with 207 people who benefited from rent reduction have an average of 3.5 *dou* of grain per person, which can only last for four months. 72 poor peasant households with 231 people who just turned over have an average of 2.87 *dou* of grain per person, which can only last for three months. Zhang Village in the Fifth District of Neiqiu is a village with a harvest of 100% this year. During recruitment, it was discovered that the militia captain currently has nothing to eat. Two other militiamen who signed up with him have not yet received their cotton-padded clothes. These facts show that the disaster is most serious for poor and hired peasants.\n\n(2) Who exactly is facing the greatest production difficulties, and who lacks the ability to overcome the famine through production? Looking at the ownership of textile tools in Buyao Village, Lincheng: out of 149 households in the village, there are 55 weaving machines. 64 poor peasant households have only 9 machines, averaging more than 7 households per machine. 68 middle peasant households have 43 machines, averaging 1.5 machines per household. 8 rich peasant households have 3 machines, averaging one machine per 2.5 households. In Shicheng Village, out of 278 households, 57 are poor and hired peasants. Out of 58 weaving machines in the village, poor and hired peasants own only 9. According to a survey of 28 poor and hired peasant households, 18 households lack textile capital. This shows that poor and hired peasants lack production tools and capital in winter production and lack the ability to overcome the famine.\n\n(3) Has past lending helped poor and hired peasants? In Nanhui Mountain, Lincheng, 240,000 yuan was loaned, and five households that were struggled against received 100,000 yuan. In Buyao Village, two old middle peasant households borrowed 130,000 yuan, while 15 poor peasant households borrowed 80,000 yuan. In Beiyangjiao, Zanhuang, the organization of poor and hired peasants to inspect loans found that three households that were struggled against borrowed 25,000 yuan, while only 16 out of 59 poor peasant households borrowed 130,000 yuan, and 23 middle peasant households borrowed 200,500 yuan. In the past, emphasis was placed on combining with idle capital. This year, Chengdi Village, Lincheng, borrowed money to buy 17 mules, but not a single poor or hired peasant bought one. The purpose of lending in Shahe emphasized textiles and transportation, but some poor and hired peasants could not engage in textiles and transportation and could not get loans to buy peanut, sweet potato, or tofu seedlings. In Zanhuang's Fourth District, loan procedures had time limits, required guarantors and mortgages, etc., so poor and hired peasants did not dare to borrow. Cadres were afraid that they would not be able to repay, so they did not dare to lend to them. This shows that our lending violated the principle of helping poor and hired peasants.\n\n(Ziyun, Yunge)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 赞皇、临城、内邱等县  冬季生产没走阶级路线\n紫云　芸阁\n1948-01-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　赞皇、临城、内邱等县\n    冬季生产没走阶级路线\n    【冀西消息】太行专署最近召集各县县长救联主席、县联社社长检查冬季生产：从各地调查事实发现雇贫在生活上，还有不少人正在挨饿受冻：\n    （一）究竟谁有灾荒？赞皇过去领导上是不很明确的，根据调查南徐乐有贫农十二户三十四人，现有粮八石七斗六升，每人平均只二斗五升七。中农十三户（一老中农）六十六人，现有粮四十四石二斗，每人平均六斗七。井陉灾情严重的老区大王帮旧中农十七户四十七人，每人平均粮一石三斗四，以日吃五合计，能吃一年零三个月，减租后的新中农七十一户二百零七人，每人平均粮三斗五，只能吃四个月，才翻身的贫农七十二户二百三十一人，每人平均粮二斗八升七合，能吃三个月。内邱五区张村今年是十成年景的村庄，在参军中发现民兵队长现下就没吃的，还有两个民兵与他一块报名参军，还未穿上棉衣。而仅从这些事实看出贫雇灾荒是最严重的。\n    （二）究竟谁生产中最困难，谁没有生产渡荒能力？从临城补腰村纺织工具的占有上看；全村一百四十九户五十五张织布机，贫农六十四户只有九张，平均七户多一张，中农六十八户四十三张机，平均一户半一张机，富农八户三张。平均二户半一机。石城村二百七十八户，贫雇五十七户，全村五十八张织机，贫雇只有九张。又据二十八户贫雇会上调查，就有十八户没纺织资本。这说明了贫雇在冬季生产中，是缺乏生产工具及资本，没有渡荒能力。\n    （三）检查过去贷款是否扶助了贫雇？临城南辉山贷款二十四万，五个被斗户就贷了十万；补腰村老中农二户贷了十三万，贫农十五户贷八万。赞皇北羊角组织贫雇检查贷款中发现被斗户三户贷二万五千元，贫农五十九户只十六户贷了十三万，中农二十三户贷了二十万零五百元。过去强调结合游资，临城澄底村今年贷款买骡子十七匹，而贫雇没买到一个。沙河贷款用途，强调纺织运输，而有些贫雇不能进行纺织运输，想买花生红薯豆腐秧却贷不到款。赞皇四区贷款手续上有限期、找保抵押等，贫雇不敢贷，干部怕还不起，也不敢贷给，这说明了我们贷款是违背了扶助贫雇原则的。　　　　　　　　　　（紫云、芸阁）"

    "content": "[Jinan News] In Li Shengzhuang, Qiu County, landlords and rich peasants have seized power in production, constantly harming the poor masses. Among the nine cadres of the village cooperative, the manager, accountant, and purchasing agent are all rich peasants who have been struggled against. Among the workers in the cooperative's oil press, there is one landlord and two rich peasants. The oil carriers used are also mostly from landlords. The oil press has good food and drink and also operates a gambling den. From October, the oil press made 150 stacks of oil in 80 days, earning a gross profit of 630,000 yuan, but spending 563,000 yuan on expenses alone, leaving a net profit of only 60,000 yuan. Since the cooperative is controlled by landlords, their hearts are with the landlords, and they immediately gave more than 30,000 yuan to the households being struggled against from the money earned. When the higher authorities issued loans of 400,000 yuan, the landlord managers did not lend to those who were poor, but to those who had \"understanding\" of the cooperative, resulting in all the loans going to rich and middle peasants. In the autumn, the bank issued another 900,000 yuan in loans, which they all put into the cooperative, and the dividends were distributed according to the amount of shares. Wu Zaichao and other 18 poor peasant households had no shares and could not receive dividends. The poor people do the hard work in the cotton ginning room, but the dividend distribution method is 4.5 points for the bow, 3 for the donkey, and 2.5 for the person. The people and donkeys eat their own food, and the repair of the bow is the responsibility of the bow owner. Ginning cotton can earn 8,000 yuan a day, but after food, each person only has 560 yuan left per day. Two animals, after fodder, only have 1,250 yuan left per day. A foreign bow costs 30,000 yuan in repairs in seven months, netting 3,458 yuan per day. This method makes the hard-working poor suffer and benefits the rich who have tools. The poor people have seen through it and are very dissatisfied. The landlord purchasing agent Yang Chunlin took a person to Nangong to buy dyestuff, making a trip every seven days, taking both cars and sedan chairs, but the dividends were distributed 40% to the person and 60% to the money, with each person receiving a net of 30,500 yuan. The second time they bought dyestuff, they lost 120,000 yuan, all of which was charged to the cooperative. When the poor wanted to withdraw their shares, the landlord cadres of the cooperative threatened, \"You kid are sabotaging!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 邱县李省庄合作社  地主富农当掌柜天天想法坑穷人\n\n1948-01-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　邱县李省庄合作\n    地主富农当掌柜天天想法坑穷人\n    【冀南消息】邱县李省庄在生产中地主富农掌了大权，处处坑害贫苦群众。村里合作社九个干部，经理、会计、购买员都是被斗富农，社内的油坊工人中有一个地主，两个富农，用的油挑也多是地主。油坊里好吃好喝，还开着赌场。油坊从十月份起，八十天内打了一百五十个垛，赚毛利六十三万元，但光盘费就用了五十六万三千元，净赚只六万多元。合作社既是地主握大权，他们心就向地主，赚的钱马上就给了被斗户三万多元。上级发下贷款四十万，当掌柜的地主更不按谁穷贷给谁，而按谁对合作社有“认识”，结果都贷给富农和中农了。秋天时银行又发给贷款九十万，他们全数入社，红利按股本多少分，吴在朝等十八户贫农没股，就不能分红。弹花房做出力活都是穷人，但分红办法是弓分四点五，驴分三，人分二点五，人驴是吃自己的，修理弓归弓户。弹花一天能赚八千元，一个人除吃，每天只剩五百六十元。两个牲口除草料，每天只剩一千二百五十元。洋弓七个月花修理费三万元，每天净落三千四百五十八元。这种办法，苦了出力穷人，好活了有工具的富人，贫苦人都看透了，很不满意。地主购买员杨春林带一人往南宫办颜色，七天一趟，又坐汽车又雇轿车，却是人四、钱六分红，每人净分三万零五百元。第二次办颜色赔了十二万，都算到社里，穷人要抽股，合作社的地主干部，便威胁说：“你这小子破坏啦！”"

When the civilian laborers set out, they were all determined to resolutely complete their tasks. The Yangcheng Yucheng District Team put forward four \"no fears\": no fear of hardship, no fear of difficulties, no fear of going to the front lines, and no fear of long hours. The stretcher team from Hongdong wrote a guarantee to their superiors stating: \"Resolutely complete the task, fear no sacrifice, and rescue the wounded under enemy fire.\" From the start of the battle on the 17th, they worked day and night, launching a campaign to care for the wounded. The Hongdong Xing Quanbao stretcher team, ignoring meals, carried the wounded, saying, \"It doesn't matter if we miss a meal or two.\" Yangcheng civilian laborer Zhang Xianglong and five others were tasked with transporting equipment, but they went to the front lines and rescued the wounded under artillery fire. The civilian laborers of Wanquan fought alongside the troops, demolishing a wall in an hour, clearing the way for artillery fire. Jincheng civilian laborer Chen Tingfu led everyone in digging fortifications under enemy fire, enabling the troops to quickly complete their combat preparations. The transportation teams showed unprecedented speed. One transportation team, transporting siege equipment from ×× to the front lines, traveled 120 li in 14 hours, enabling the troops to receive the equipment in time and construct fortifications. Twenty-seven militia platoons from the First, Second, and Fourth Military Sub-districts actively undertook the arduous tasks of escorting the wounded, transporting ammunition, and guarding prisoners. Civilian laborers from Tunliu also bravely cooperated with the troops, undertaking flank security. On the day Yuncheng was captured, 2,000 carts transported supplies day and night without stopping.\n　　[This newspaper's dispatch from the Southern Shanxi Front on the 6th] There are more than 300 large and small bunkers inside and outside Yuncheng, including tall and large \"high bunkers\" and \"ground bunkers\" that crawl on the ground. They are all made of steel rails, steel plates, and foreign lime, making them very strong. The enemy called them \"copper walls and iron ramparts, impossible to break through,\" but this did not stop the People's Liberation Army from attacking. Yuncheng was quickly captured by the People's Liberation Army.

It calls for the organization of a \"Left-Wing\" Labour government, resolutely implementing the Labour Party's election platform. The plan formally demands expanding investment in the economy to update British industrial equipment and solve the housing shortage. To this end, the plan strongly advocates greatly reducing the size of the armed forces and increasing trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. Regarding the issue of increasing coal production, the British Communist Party's plan proposes that coal production should reach 233 million tons in 1948, and steel production should also reach 1.5 million tons this year. The British Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, commented on this plan, stating: The purpose of the plan is to illustrate the demands of the British people, namely to improve the equipment of important industries, raise the people's living standards, and restore political and economic independence. Because without economic independence, there can be no political independence. Because the government has deprived industry of its labor force and maintained a huge army, it has delayed Britain's recovery and made Britain dependent on the United States.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-10",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[Report from This Newspaper] The training and education conference held by the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region concluded on December 26th, having begun on December 15th of last year. After reports and discussions, in addition to the participation of the military and political leaders and responsible comrades of the training and education departments of various military regions, columns, and the military academy, Deputy Commanders Xu and Teng also personally participated and presided over the meeting. During the reports and discussions, on the one hand, ruthless exposure and deep self-criticism were made regarding the shortcomings of dogmatism and formalism in the training and education work of the troops. On the other hand, many valuable experiences were also introduced. For example, the 11th Column's experience in night attacks, village battles, and fighting tanks; their conduct of this practical combat education was mainly through battlefield summaries. At the same time, the excellent system of \"assessing casualties,\" which uses combat to teach combat, was also widely established in the 11th Column. The Taihang 41st Regiment, from January to November 17th, 1947, in addition to marching and fighting, secured a total of 98 days for training. After training, their combat effectiveness was greatly improved. Another example is that during the first attack on Yuncheng by a certain column, while the front-line troops were fighting, the second-line troops were still using their time to train. This proves that seizing the gaps between battles for training is not only necessary but also possible. The conference concluded on December 26th. First, Deputy Commander Teng gave a concluding report, focusing on the following issues:\n\n\t(1) Regarding strengthening troop training, it is extremely important to seize the gaps between battles for training; we must utilize all available time for training at any time and any place. The idea that frequent battles make training impossible or that training is impossible during gaps between battles is wrong. Troop training must be the responsibility of the leaders, who must personally take action. Any commander who only knows how to fight but does not understand training or neglects training cannot be a good commander; his troops cannot become a victorious army. At the same time, this is also being irresponsible to the people or not fulfilling all responsibilities; it is treating the lives of the people's soldiers as child's play. Therefore, a good commander must regard training and combat as equally important tasks, and leaders at all levels must take responsibility for training.\n\n\t(2) The training and education guidelines for 1948 are: In the military aspect: strengthen the technical training of the troops, improve the command ability of cadres, and through training and combat, make our troops able to withstand the test of continuous operations. At the same time, in tactics, we must cultivate a tenacious spirit of attacking fortified positions and learn the skills of attacking fortified positions to adapt to the task of continuous fortified attacks to eliminate the remaining enemies in the inner lines. The specific requirements for military training are: senior cadres should strengthen tactical ideological education, improve theoretical levels, summarize combat experience, and combine theory with practice to improve command ability. Company and battalion cadres should strengthen their ability to organize combat, appropriately use light and heavy weapons, be good at commanding troops, and be proficient in technology. Troop education should focus on improving the ability to attack fortified positions and conduct continuous operations, so that the new corps can be trained into strong main force corps. In particular, it is necessary to improve the troops' skills in shooting, grenade throwing, bayonet fighting, field work, and demolition. Guerrilla units are required to be good at fighting small annihilation battles (annihilating an enemy squad or platoon) and clearly establish the idea of accumulating small victories into big ones. The main task of the militia is to learn flying demolition and fight sparrow warfare. In terms of political education: conduct universal Party and army rectification, start with \"speaking bitterness,\" universally carry out class investigation and ideological investigation movements, and deeply conduct class education on land reform. This is basic education, and all other education must be conducted around class education. It is necessary to strengthen systematic current affairs education, deepen and enhance the confidence in the inevitable defeat of Chiang Kai-shek and our inevitable victory, overcome right-leaning sentiments, eliminate certain pro-American views, and shatter peace illusions from any quarter. Attention should be paid to strengthening the cultural education of the troops: Because 350,000 liberated peasants are enthusiastically joining our People's Liberation Army, it is of particular importance to strengthen the cultural education of the troops and carry out literacy campaigns to improve their cultural level. Therefore, we call on comrades from intellectual backgrounds to enthusiastically help workers and peasants learn culture.\n\n\t(3) Regarding the education of cadres on the job: It is stipulated that all agencies above the regimental level should resume the system of two hours of study per day. Party committee secretaries at all levels in the army must be responsible for leading and organizing cadre study; Party committees at all levels must act in accordance with the Party Constitution and regard leading study as one of their regular tasks. In addition, some required documents for cadres on the job are stipulated: Required reading for military and political cadres above the regimental level includes: \"Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War,\" \"The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party,\" \"The Outline Land Law of China,\" \"Resolution of the Gutian Conference,\" Comrade Tan Zheng's report on army political work, \"On Coalition Government,\" \"On the Liberated Area Battlefield,\" \"Combined Tactics,\" \"Fear and Fearlessness,\" \"Days and Nights,\" and \"The People Are Immortal.\" Required reading for military and political cadres at the battalion and company levels includes: \"The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party,\" \"The Outline Land Law of China,\" \"Principles of Tactics,\" and \"Fear and Fearlessness.\" Guerrilla unit cadres can also read \"Russian Sailors\" and \"Eyewitness Account.\" Medical cadres must also read the book \"Surgeon.\" Other arms of service and departments should also read one or two professional books.\n\n\t(4) Regarding school education: Restore and improve all levels of rotational training teams, and leaders at all levels must strengthen the leadership of schools at all levels. It is now stipulated that the Military and Political University is a school for cultivating talents, cultivating company and battalion cadres for the troops.

Wallace has a considerable number of supporters, especially among workers, poor farmers, blacks, and intellectuals. Democratic Party leaders fear that Wallace's move will win the support of millions of voters who consistently supported the Democratic Party during the Roosevelt era but now believe that Truman's platform is little different from the Republican Party's. According to a United Press reporter from Chicago, after Wallace's speech, the Illinois Progressive Party, the California Progressive Party, the CIO Transport Workers Union, Congressman Marcantonio of the American Labor Party, and Barton, chairman of the \"National Farmers Union,\" all expressed welcome and support. Wallace gave a speech in Milwaukee on the 30th, explaining his platform to reporters. Wallace said that the naming of the new party and the vice-presidential candidate would be decided at the national congress to establish the new party. He also said that the congress would likely be held within one or two months. In response to a question about whether he would accept the support of the Communist Party, he said that he welcomed the support of groups willing to support him.

    "content": "Rich Peasants in Power Render Struggle Useless\n　　Fruits of Struggle From Two Years Ago Still Undistributed\n    [Shahe News] In Taishang Village, Fourth District, it was discovered that the fruits of the land reform struggle from two years ago have not yet been distributed to the hired and poor masses. The village has thin soil and the people live a very hard life. The village has only forty households, and villagers make a living by farming and grinding flour. General cadres said: \"The village is poor and there are no big landlords, so it is not easy to turn things around.\" They rarely went to work in this village. It wasn't until the district-wide conference of over five hundred hired and poor representatives and hired and poor rural cadres was held on December 24th to inspect winter production that it was discovered that the masses had not turned things around at all. Han Chunzhao, a hired peasant in the village, said: \"Our village chief, Han Changnian, was a puppet Ba長 [head of a bao, a subdivision of a township during the Nationalist period] during the enemy-puppet era, and also a rich peasant who was struggled against. The secretary, Han Xiaotang, is a 'voluntary household' (a household that evaded struggle by voluntarily handing over grain and land). Twenty bags of grain, two hundred jin of cloth, and trees, etc., from the struggle have not been distributed. The village chief even sent a piglet to his sister's house to raise. This is what they call the hired and poor turning things around, turning around empty-handed.\" This gave the cadres from the county and district who attended the meeting a great education, and they examined and recognized their past mistakes and bureaucratic work style. After the meeting, Comrade Zhang Haiquan, the distribution secretary, went to the village to deal with these problems. From this, he discovered that six hired and poor households, with fourteen people, had no housing. The village chief used the ox obtained through struggle for his own transportation. Wang Bangren, a rich peasant who was struggled against, had three people and twenty-three rooms. Han Laobian had four people and twenty rooms. Other people like Han Xiaohe and Han Siwei also had many houses. Comrade Zhang immediately convened a meeting of hired and poor peasants to discuss the matter. He temporarily lent houses to six hired and poor households, including Yang Jiezizi, and removed the village chief. The embezzled ox was taken out and handed over to the hired and poor to use for transportation. (Dehua)\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    The masses of Taishang Village are still ruled by traitorous puppet Ba長 and feudal rich peasants, living a poor life. It is not enough for the leadership to simply be shocked and admit their own bureaucracy; further examination should be conducted. After the branch committee secretary discovered the problem, he immediately replaced the village chief and handed over the ox to the hired and poor. This handling is appropriate. But have the masses of this village consciously risen up to take charge? Has the land problem of the hired and poor been resolved?

Wang Mingde went out without shouting or saying anything. He only brought back squad leader Xing Shiru.

    "content": "Pingding Inspects Production in Disaster Areas\n  　Provides Loans to Help Poor Laborers\n    [Pingding News] In mid-December, the Pingding County government conducted in-depth inspections of production work in the severely disaster-stricken areas of Xibaian, Chaoyangpo, and Dongxisuohuang villages. It was found that the most serious problem in these areas was that some district and village cadres were satisfied with the lively actions and preliminary achievements of the masses who had labor and tools, neglecting the interests of the poor laborers and failing to pay attention to solving their production difficulties. For example, in Chaoyangpo, District 2, out of 161 full and semi-auxiliary male laborers and 20 donkeys in the whole village, except for 19 people who were unable to work due to illness, all others had taken action in various production lines. However, only six of the 28 small carts belonged to the poor laborers, and the remaining 22 belonged to the middle peasants and above. Only six of the 20 donkeys belonged to the poor laborers. In transportation production, the middle peasants and above could use carts (each cart can carry more than 300 catties) and donkeys (each donkey can carry 150-160 catties) to earn big profits, while most of the poor laborers lacked transportation tools and donkeys, relying only on human labor (each person carrying 60 catties), exerting great effort but earning small profits. Another example is Xibaian, District 1, where 20 donkeys were still idle, these animals were the fruits distributed to the poor laborers, and because the problem of communal feeding was not resolved, they could not work due to mutual constraints. However, the cadres in these villages said, \"It's not a problem anymore,\" \"Everyone is taking action.\"\n\n    The county studied this problem and has instructed all districts to immediately overcome complacency, conduct in-depth inspections, implement the poor laborers' class line, and solve the difficulties of the poor laborers in textile, transportation production, and iron industry development.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. Reports from Milan: The Italian Communist Party's Sixth National Congress solemnly opened in Milan on the 5th. Attending were 800 delegates representing 2.25 million Italian Communist Party members. Fraternal parties from various countries also sent delegations to attend. Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti, in a speech that lasted \"six hours without showing any fatigue,\" vehemently denounced the American imperialist and Vatican policies aimed at enslaving Italy. Togliatti pointed out: \"The United States has turned Italy into a beachhead for its anti-Soviet conspiracy. To this end, it is exerting pressure on the Roman government and has found rampant accomplices within the Roman government.\" Togliatti pointed out that the Gasperi government is manipulated and exploited by American imperialism. This government will soon sell Italy to the United States, and therefore, Italy is in danger of being enslaved and turned into a foreign tool. After pointing out that \"the Vatican is another major enemy of Italy,\" Togliatti emphasized that the Italian working people and the Communist Party resolutely oppose the establishment of a European bloc and advocate establishing friendly relations and trade relations with all countries, especially Eastern European countries, to avoid making Italy a pawn of any country. Togliatti went on to denounce American imperialism and the Vatican as the world's biggest warmongers. He pointed out that the danger of war is the result of the American program of expansion and world hegemony, with the Vatican as its accomplice. But Togliatti said with confidence that the democratic forces of the world today are stronger than the warmongers. As long as peace-loving nations are not intimidated and rise up to stop them, war can be avoided. In his speech on domestic policy, Togliatti pointed out that the Christian Democratic Party and Catholic Action are currently the two major enemies of Italian democracy. Togliatti insisted: \"All our goals will be achieved through legal means, but if our enemies want to use force, we are prepared to use the enemies' methods to deal with them.\"\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. According to TASS, Rome, December 30th: Italian Socialist Party leader Nenni recently delivered a speech here, denouncing the aggressive policies of American imperialism, saying: The purpose of the Marshall Plan is to make the European economy subservient to American imperialism. As a result, the United States has intervened in the Mediterranean, supporting the Franco dictatorship in Spain and supporting the Greek fascist government, which are the mortal enemies of democracy. Nenni pointed out the Italian Socialist Party's foreign policy, stating: We firmly oppose the American attempt to establish a Western European bloc. Italy's economic interests require smooth trade with Eastern European countries. We must not allow foreign countries to control Italy's economic life and hinder the social reforms that have been implemented. Nenni stressed: But the current Italian government is unable to guarantee Italy's independence. It is neither able to oppose the greed of industrialists nor willing to resist the growing pressure from reactionaries, who are trying to turn Italy into a second Greece or Spain. Therefore, opposing the current government is a prerequisite for the struggle for peace.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 意共举行六代大会　托格里亚蒂痛骂美侵略\n\n1948-01-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　意共举行六代大会\n  　托格里亚蒂痛骂美侵略\n    【新华社陕北八日电】综合米兰讯：意共第六次全国代表大会于五日在米兰隆重揭幕。到有代表二百二十五万意共党员的八百名代表，各国兄弟党亦纷纷派遣代表团列席。意共领袖托格里亚蒂曾在会上“作长达六小时而毫无倦容”的演说中，痛斥美国帝国主义及梵蒂冈企图奴役意国的政策。托氏指出：“美国已将意大利作成其反苏阴谋的滩头阵地，为此目的，它对罗马政府施行压力，并在罗马政府中找到了横行霸道的帮凶。”托氏指出：加斯贝利政府为美帝国主义所操纵利用，这一政府不久将把意大利出卖给美国，因而意大利有被奴役和变为外国工具之危险。托氏在指出“意大利的另一大敌即梵蒂冈”以后，即强调：意大利劳动人民及共产党坚决反对成立欧洲集团，主张与一切国家，特别是与东欧诸国建立友好邦交及商业关系，以避免使意国成为任何国家掌中之物。托氏继痛斥美国帝国主义及梵蒂冈是世界上最大的战争贩子。他指出战争的危险是美国扩张及独霸世界的纲领之结果，并有梵蒂冈为其帮凶。但托氏满怀信心地说：今天全世界的民主力量比好战派的力量强大，只要爱好和平各民族不怕恫吓，奋起制止，战争即能避免。托氏在其国内政策一部分演说中，指出基督教民主党及天主教行动党，是目前意大利民主的两大敌人，托氏坚称：“我们的一切目的，将以合法的办法达成，但是，假如我们的敌人要用武力，我们就准备采用敌人的办法来对付它。”\n    【新华社陕北六日电】据塔斯社罗马十二月三十日讯：意社会党领袖南尼，顷在此间发表演说，痛斥美帝国主义的侵略政策称：马歇尔计划的目的，在于使欧洲经济听命于美帝国主义。结果所至，美国已插手干涉地中海，它们支持西班牙佛朗哥独裁，扶植希腊法西斯政府，这些都是民主的死敌。南尼指出意社会党的外交政策称：我们坚决反对美国建立西欧集团的企图，意国的经济利益需要与东欧各国畅通贸易，必须不让外国控制意大利的经济生活及阻碍已实行的社会改革。南尼力称：但意大利现政府无力保障意国独立，它既无力反对工业家的贪求，又不愿反抗反动派增长着的压力，而这些反动派却力图沦意大利为希腊或西班牙第二。因此，反对现政府乃是为和平而斗争的先决条件。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 6th: A comprehensive report from Rome states that the Italian People's Democratic Front movement is expanding throughout Italy. Local committees of the People's Democratic Front have been established in major cities such as Turin, Genoa, Milan, Pescara, and Florence to unite all democratic mass organizations in various regions. It is expected that such committees will be established in many other cities soon. According to TASS, many representatives from right-wing parties in Italy, such as the Republican Party, the Saragat Party, and the Christian Democratic Party, are also participating in these committees. Meanwhile, the Italian Women's League was also established in Rome on the 30th of last month, calling on Italian women to participate in the People's Democratic Front to fight for various women's rights. The democratic forces in Italy are now unprecedentedly strong. According to Longo, one of the leaders of the Italian Communist Party, who recently recalled his experience in leading the underground resistance movement, \"The most serious blow we dealt to fascist Nazis was not only armed struggle, but also the mass actions of millions of workers, who were as united as one person.\" Longo emphasized, \"For the current purpose, today we can also prevent any reactionary will and the intentions of American imperialism and its Italian lackeys from being realized, and we can implement measures and regulations that they are unwilling to implement.\"\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 8th: Moscow News: An analyst for Pravda, commenting on the establishment of the People's Democratic Front in Italy, stated: The People's Democratic Front founding assembly, held on December 28, 1947, for labor, peace, freedom, and national independence, will occupy the most important place in Italy's post-war history. The establishment of this front is a major success in uniting all genuinely democratic forces of the Italian people. It represents a new climax in the struggle of the Italian working masses to establish people's democracy and to fight against the combined forces of domestic and foreign reactionaries. The Italian People's Democratic Front is not a coalition of party leadership organs, but a mass-based people's organization, a new form of unity and cooperation among all democratic forces in Italy. The consistent actions of the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party, the initiators and driving forces of the People's Democratic Front, have become the primary condition for the success of the People's Democratic Front. The success of the People's Democratic Front is also due to the establishment of a lasting alliance between the Italian working class and the laboring peasants. The Italian workers' movement has received the support and endorsement of the peasant masses, who share common enemies and common goals. The National Congress of Peasants and Agricultural Workers, held in Bologna on the 21st of last month with the participation of 6,000 representatives, unanimously passed a resolution pointing out that the unity of the urban and rural working people is \"the foundation of the invincible power of the people.\" The establishment of the Italian People's Democratic Front constitutes a new blow to the imperialist camp and will prove that the reactionary coalition group, from Gasperi, the Vatican, Saragat (note: traitor of the Socialist Party) all the way to Cianini (note: leader of the Fascist Party's Common Man's Front—formerly translated as the Common People's Party), attempts to prevent Italy from advancing along the democratic path and reduce it to a colony of American capital; all these conspiracies are doomed to fail.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 6th: Rome News: Demonstrations and strikes broke out again in Italy around the New Year. On January 2nd, 2,000 unemployed agricultural workers in Baselliana and Apo Gozo, Sicily, held demonstrations protesting the delay in issuing unemployment relief funds. The demonstrating workers once repelled police attempts to suppress the demonstration. On the same day, hundreds of unemployed workers blocked traffic on the Ausselia Road near Calaross. Bank employees across Italy went on strike starting on December 31st. The National Federation of Bank Employee Unions put forward a collective bargaining agreement on wages, but it was unreasonably rejected by the Gasperi government. The strike is still ongoing.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 意国人民斗争到了新高潮　民主阵线正向全国发展\n\n1948-01-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　意国人民斗争到了新高潮\n  　民主阵线正向全国发展\n    【新华社陕北六日电】综合罗马讯：意大利人民民主阵线运动，正在全意扩展中。在都灵、热那亚、米兰、贝斯加拉及佛罗伦斯诸中心城市，都已成立人民民主阵线的地方委员会，以团结各地一切民主的群众组织。这种委员会，预料最近将在其它许多城市建立起来。据塔斯社讯，意右翼政党如共和党、萨拉盖特党和基督教民主党的代表，参加这种委员会的也不少。同时，意大利妇女联盟也于上月三十日在罗马成立，号召意妇女参加人民民主阵线，以争取妇女的各种权利。意大利民主力量现在已无比壮大，据意共领袖之一隆哥最近在追述领导地下抵抗运动时的经验说：“我们予法西斯纳粹最严重的打击，不仅是武装斗争，而且还在于数百万工人的群众性行动，他们团结得象一个人一样”。隆哥强调指出：“为了当前目的，今天我们也能使任何反动派的意志与美帝国主义及其意大利从仆的意图无法实现，我们能实施他们所不愿实行的措施与规定。”\n    【新华社陕北八日电】莫斯科讯：真理报分析家评意大利建立人民民主阵线称：一九四七年十二月二十八日举行的为劳动、和平、自由与国家独立的人民民主阵线成立大会，在意大利战后的历史上，将占有最重要的地位。这一阵线的成立，在集合意大利人民一切真正民主势力上，是一大成功，它表示着意大利劳苦大众为建立人民民主及与国内外反动派联合势力进行斗争之新高潮。意大利人民民主阵线不是党派领导机关的联合，而是一个群众性的人民团体，是意国一切民主势力团结与合作的新形式。人民民主阵线的发起人及推动力量意共与社会党的行动一致，已成为人民民主阵线成功的首要条件。人民民主阵线的成功，也是由于意大利工人阶级和劳动农民建立持久联盟的结果。意大利工人运动得到农民群众的支持及拥护，他们具有共同的敌人与共同的目标。在上月二十一日于波伦亚举行的六千代表参加的农民与农业工人全国大会，曾一致通过决议，指出城乡劳动人民团结一致，是“人民不可战胜的力量之基础。”意大利人民民主阵线的成立，形成了对帝国主义阵营的新打击，并将证明从加斯贝利、梵蒂冈、萨拉盖特（按：社会党之叛徒）一直到齐亚尼尼（按：系法西斯党普通人阵线——过去译平民党——的党魁）的反动联合集团，企图阻止意大利沿民主道路前进，并使之降于美国资本的殖民地的一切阴谋，即将失败。\n    【新华社陕北六日电】罗马讯：新年前后，意大利又发生示威及罢工。一月二日，西西里巴塞良纳及阿波哥左，有二千名失业农业工人举行示威，抗议拖延不发失业救济金。示威工人曾一度击退企图镇压示威的警察。同日，数百名失业工人阻止了卡拉洛斯附近奥塞利亚路的交通。意全国各地银行员工，于十二月三十一日起罢工，银行雇员工会全国联合会提出集体谈判工资的契约，但遭加斯贝利政府的无理拒绝，罢工至今仍继续中。"

They put on airs of bureaucracy and do not care about the interests of the people, causing over twenty tasks to waste more than 20,000 laborers. The Yuabei Special Commissioner's Office of Taiyue has reviewed this serious situation. On December 11th, the Yuabei Special Commissioner's Office convened a meeting of dispatch officers from ten counties in the district. After seven days of reporting, discussion, and research, they rigorously criticized the erroneous thinking of \"handling official business as official business\" that had existed in the past in dispatch work, which led to a failure to use their minds and find solutions, resulting in serious waste in dispatch tasks. During the reports at the meeting, among the twenty-four examples cited by nine counties, due to unnecessary or random requests, poorly planned, unclear collection points, requesting more than needed, weighing shortages or putting on airs when the warehouse received grain, cadres leading laborers being irresponsible or insisting on doing the impossible, careless writing in official documents and phone calls when allocating tasks, and mechanically executing dispatch systems, there was a waste of 22,736 laborers and 505 animal labor days. For example, this year, more than 10,000 dan of public grain in Pingjie were moved to the mountains using more than 10,000 laborers. Because it was not carefully considered, the grain was concentrated in one place. When the enemy became active in the mountains, more than 10,000 laborers were used to disperse it again. In November, Qinyuan requested 122 laborers from the first district to carry electric poles to the Dalin area. The phone call said to cut electric poles, but the laborers returned without carrying them. As a result, another 120 people were sent. In September, Nanbu Station requested 50 donkeys from Huo County, but after using them all, they even returned 11 extras. Two family members of the Fourth Column, from Fushan to Anze and Shan, requested three donkeys for the two of them, carrying flowers, salt, and other items for production. The Fourth Column's garrison office requested seven carts from Changzi, but they only came to pick up the carts five days after the agreed date, and the laborers waited for five days. Examples like these exist in every county. The comrades leading the dispatch tasks simply followed the procedures without stopping or suggesting any changes. At this point, everyone deeply realized that it was not we who contributed the strength, but the masses who contributed the strength, and we wasted it due to our irresponsibility. Director Liang pointed out in his summary that the most important thing to pay attention to in dispatch tasks today is to use our brains and think more, and not to do work mechanically, doing exactly what is ordered. Secondly, we must strengthen our leadership over districts and villages, and criticize, expose, and punish those who do not cherish labor, and commend the good ones. In terms of ideology, we must make it clear that doing a good job in dispatch work is a good service to the people. We must not adopt an irresponsible attitude.\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（Yuabei People's Daily）\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 脑筋用在哪里去了　廿件差务浪费民工两万\n\n1948-01-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　脑筋用在哪里去了\n  　廿件差务浪费民工两万\n    【本报消息】有些工作人员饱食终日，无所用心，摆官僚主义，不关心人民的利益，闹得二十几次差务就浪费了两万多民工。太岳岳北专署已检讨出这种严重的事实。岳北专署于十二月十一日召开全区十县差务干事会议，经过七天的汇报讨论研究，严格地批判了由于过去在差务工作上存在着“公事公办”的错误思想，因而不开动机器不想办法，造成了差务上的严重浪费现象。只在会议上大家汇报时，九个县所举的二十四个例子当中，由于不该要乱要、计划不周到、集合地弄不清、用不了多要、仓库收粮时秤少或摆架子、带民工干部不负责任办不到硬办、拨差时写公事和电话上马虎和机械执行差务制度等，就浪费民力两万二千七百三十六个，牲口工五百零五个。就大的例子说：今年平介一万多石公粮，用一万多民工移到山上，因一时没考虑好就集中放起来，到敌人活动到山上时，才又用一万多民工分散了。十一月份沁源向一区要一百二十二个民工到大林区扛电杆，电话上说成砍电杆，民工去后不扛就回来了，结果又派了一百二十人。九月份南堡兵站向霍县要了五十个毛驴，去后尽用了还长回十一个。四纵队两个家属，从浮山到安泽和山，两个人要了三个毛驴，驮着花盐等东西搞生产。四纵留守处向长子要七辆大车，结果到约定日期的五天后才来带车，民工就等了五天。象这样的例子各县都有，领导办差的同志，只照样行事，既不制止，又不建议。至此大家深刻认识到我们不是拿出了力量，而是群众拿出的力量，我们不负责任而浪费了它。梁主任在总结中最后指出：今天在差务上必须首先注意的是要用脑子多考虑，决不是机器式的做工作，叫做多少就做多少。其次要抓紧对区村的领导，对不爱惜民力的要批评、揭发、处罚，好的表扬。在思想上要明确了做好差务工作，就是很好的为人民服了务。不能采取不负责的态度。　　　　　　　　　　\n                   　　　　　　　　（岳北人民报）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Su, Lu, Yu, and An Front, 8th:  For over a month, the Su, Lu, Yu, and An People's Liberation Army has been fighting and studying simultaneously, extensively carrying out the Speak Bitterness movement. Cadres and staff in the offices mostly use intensive training methods. Cadres of the Field Headquarters and most columns carry their backpacks to the companies to learn from the soldiers.  A certain unit completed its entire study plan during the battle to destroy the Longhai Railway. In the 5th Battalion of this unit, the battalion commander took the lead in speaking bitterness and convened a revenge swearing-in conference. Everyone drank chicken blood wine and solemnly read the oath to avenge and perform meritorious service while raising their guns.  In a letter to the regiment commander requesting to kill the enemy and perform meritorious service, they wrote: \"In our entire battalion, 59 comrades have personally experienced the bitterness of begging for food, 15 comrades' parents were persecuted to death by landlords, 9 comrades' siblings starved to death due to poverty and lack of food, and 17 comrades' mothers, siblings, and themselves were sold. Comrade Wang Lixian's mother, in order to breastfeed the landlord's child, personally strangled her own son. Comrade Meng Jixian's younger sister was torn apart and killed by a landlord. We must avenge these blood debts.\" The next day, the battalion established mass work teams and meritorious service committees. The 9th Battalion's land reform study was progressing to the point of stamping the oath to kill the enemy and avenge when they received the task of suppressing Chiang bandit troops in Yimenji. Everyone immediately rushed there. Upon discovering Chiang's bandit troops several times their size, the soldiers charged straight into the enemy's formation, brandishing their swords. A certain column established the dominance of hired and poor peasants. The leadership of most branches has been transformed, mainly by hired and poor peasants, becoming the core of organizing learning. A certain unit of this column first organized hired and poor peasant comrades to speak bitterness in the land reform training team, using vivid examples to defeat various landlord-rich peasant thoughts and petty-bourgeois reformist views. Then, using the method of \"check and compare,\" they exposed today's thoughts and behaviors and compared them with the class life of hired and poor peasants to see if they had forgotten their roots and stood firm on the class stand. Then compare with the class life of landlords and rich peasants to see if they were infected with landlord and rich peasant thinking. At the same time, it was proposed: If the investigation and comparison are not thorough or deep enough, go to the soldiers and \"continue the investigation\" and \"continue the comparison.\" Therefore, all comrades who participated in land reform studies have undergone great changes, clarified their right-leaning thoughts on the situation, and corrected erroneous concepts such as resisting the masses, resisting the organization, fearing hardship, and being uneasy about work. Many comrades from landlord backgrounds stood up to accuse the landlords of their crimes. Comrades from petty-bourgeois backgrounds also stood firm on the side of hired and poor peasants under the influence of the bitterness spoken by hired and poor peasant comrades and the accusations made by comrades from landlord backgrounds. The 3rd Company of the 2nd Regiment organized comrades from different backgrounds and who had suffered different hardships to conduct a chain of speaking bitterness. Whenever a certain type of question was debated, a typical case of bitterness of that type would appear, using vivid facts to draw conclusions for each question. The political instructor of a certain artillery company fully promoted democracy in leading land reform studies, consulting with hired and poor peasants in everything, from clarifying confused concepts and speaking bitterness to investigating thoughts, to settling accounts for making foreign fortunes, corruption, and hedonistic behaviors. The company commander of the company automatically handed over a gold ring that was part of his foreign fortune during the help everyone gave to check thoughts. The entire company also proposed to settle the root of landlord and rich peasant thinking. All property was publicized and registered. A certain unit held a comparison exhibition in the 1st company, displaying the homes of landlords and the homes of hired peasants. Under the contrast, they reflected on themselves and began to speak bitterness. In the land reform training of a certain unit’s cadres, they participated in land reform work in the villages. After the masses divided the land, they automatically asked the troops for guns and grenades to arm themselves for self-defense, thus resolving the ideological doubts about whether the masses in the new area dared to ask for land. In the land reform study of cadres directly under a certain column, they mobilized the masses in the village and nearby to divide the floating wealth of the landlords and local bullies. Some comrades made a foreign fortune for themselves when dividing the floating wealth, specifically exposing landlord and rich peasant thinking. The 4th Company of a certain unit proposed: \"Think whenever you have free time, speak bitterness whenever you have hardship.\" Land reform education was completed during the frequent marching and combat for thirty-three days. Sun Chenfa, a special agent who had been hiding for several years, was deeply moved and automatically confessed to the Party, vowing to be a new person. In the Shanan battle, he volunteered to serve as a demolitions expert and has now been elected as a mutual aid group leader. Li Huazhou, a liberation fighter who had tried to desert six times, was moved by speaking bitterness. During the Zhoukou battle, he rushed to the front, and when his hand grenades ran out, he used bricks to force the enemy to surrender. After studying, the company's mass discipline also improved significantly. In the past month, no one in the entire company damaged anything belonging to the masses and helped the masses carry water and do chores.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏鲁豫皖部队整军  诉苦复仇不要忘本　改造领导贫雇当家\n\n1948-01-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏鲁豫皖部队整军\n    诉苦复仇不要忘本\n  　改造领导贫雇当家\n    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线八日电】苏鲁豫皖人民解放军月余来，一面打仗，一面学习，广泛开展诉苦运动。干部及机关勤杂人员多采用集训办法。野直及多数纵队之干部，并自背背包到连队向战士学习。某部于陇海路破击战期间，紧张的完成了全部学习计划。该部五大队由大队长带头诉苦，并召开了复仇宣誓大会，每人喝了鸡血酒，举起枪庄严的宣读复仇立功誓词。他们在写给团长要求杀敌立功的信上说：“我们全大队有五十九个同志亲身尝过讨饭的苦，有十五个同志的父母被地主逼死打死，有九个同志的兄弟姊妹因穷困没饭吃而活活饿死，有十七个同志的母亲兄弟姊妹和本人被卖掉。王立贤同志的母亲为了给地主的孩子喂奶，亲手捏死了自己的儿子。孟继先同志的妹妹被地主撕开两腿而死。这些血海深仇一定要报。”第二天该大队便成立群众工作组和立功委员会。九大队的土地改革学习，正进行到在杀敌复仇誓词上盖印之际，接到了进剿义门集蒋匪的任务，大家立即飞驰而去，当发现数倍于我的蒋匪时，战士们纵马挥刀，直扑敌阵。某纵队确立雇贫农的优势，一般支部领导成份均经改造，以雇贫农为主，成为组织学习的核心。该纵队某部土地改革集训队首先组织雇贫农同志诉苦，以活生生的事例，将各种地主富农思想及小资产阶级改良主义的观点击败，然后用“查一查”“比一比”的方法，揭发今天的思想行为并与雇贫农的阶级生活相对比，看是否忘了本，是否站稳了阶级立场。再和地主富农的阶级生活相对比，看是否染了地主富农思想。同时提出：查比不彻底不深刻的到战士面前去“续查”“续比”。因此凡是参加土地改革学习的同志，都有了很大的转变，澄清了对时局的右倾思想，及对抗群众、对抗组织、怕吃苦、不安心工作等错误观念。许多地主成份的同志起来控诉地主的罪恶。小资产阶级出身的同志则在雇贫农同志诉苦与地主成份同志控诉的影响下也站稳到雇贫农方面来。二团三连组织不同来历和受过不同苦难的同志进行连环诉苦，争论到那一类问题时，即有那一类的典型诉苦出现。以有声有色的事实做了每个问题的结论。某部炮兵连政指领导土地改革学习中充分发扬民主，凡事和雇贫农商量，从弄清糊涂观念诉苦查思想，直到清算发洋财、贪污、享乐等行为。该连连长在大家帮助查思想中，自动把发洋财的金戒指交公。全连并由此提出要清算地主富农思想的根。所有财物都实行公布登记。该部一连举行对比展览会，布置了地主的家庭和雇农的家庭。在对比之下，回想自己，展开诉苦。某部干部土地改革集训中，参加驻村土地改革工作，群众分地之后，自动向部队要枪、要手榴弹，武装自卫，于是解决了“新区群众敢不敢要土地”的思想疑虑。某纵队直属队干部土地改革学习中，发动驻村及附近群众分地主恶霸浮财，有些同志在分浮财时自己发了洋财，具体暴露了地主富农思想。某部四连提出：“有空就想，有苦就诉”。在三十三天频繁的行军作战中，完成了土地改革教育。隐藏了几年的特务分子孙辰法，深受感动自动向党坦白，立誓重新做人。沙南战斗，他自告奋勇要求担任爆破，现已被选为互助组长。曾六次想开小差的解放战士李华周为诉苦感动，在周口战斗时，冲在最前面，手榴弹打完了用砖头迫使敌人缴枪。该连经学习后，群众纪律也显著提高，一月来全连无一人损坏群众的东西，并帮助群众挑水作活。"

When this was impossible, they delayed it and entangled it with other minor issues.\" (2) The issue of rebuilding a unified Germany: \"The Soviet delegation firmly advocated the immediate establishment of a provisional central government for a democratic Germany. After being opposed by the United States, Britain, and France, it suggested taking the first step of establishing central administrative departments for the German economy, because this is not only related to the national life of the German people but also to the democratization and elimination of militarism throughout the territory of Germany, and will guarantee Germany's fulfillment of its obligations to the Allied countries.\" \"However, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France reduced the task of unification to merely the occupying authorities concluding certain agreements to eliminate tariff barriers for the circulation of goods. Their purpose was only to facilitate the dumping of goods in Germany by their countries' export companies.\" Molotov further exposed the activities of the United States, Britain, and France in undermining the reconstruction and unification of Germany, stating: \"Recently, American and British newspapers have reported news about the preparation of a separate German government in the occupied areas, a constitution has already been drafted, and new currencies are being issued.\" \"Now everyone knows that the United States wants to turn Western Germany into a base for expansion into Europe.\" \"The Marshall Plan provides Western Germany with billions of dollars in loans over four years, so that German and American monopoly capitalists can become more reconciled, jointly exploit the German people, and make it more difficult for German small and medium-sized industrialists.\" Molotov pointed out that, according to this U.S. plan, the interests of the countries that had been invaded by Germany were naturally disregarded, and opposition was raised to Germany fulfilling its reparations obligations. Obviously, the longer the United States delays the formation of a unified German government, the more time those implementing the U.S. plan have to \"do as they please.\" Finally, Molotov strongly stated: \"The responsibility for the failure of the London Conference should be borne by the U.S. ruling class, and Bevin and Bidault also echoed Marshall.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 莫洛托夫答记者  美国怀着分裂德国鬼胎使得伦敦外长会议失败\n\n1948-01-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　莫洛托夫答记者\n    美国怀着分裂德国鬼胎使得伦敦外长会议失败\n    【新华社陕北六日电】莫斯科讯：莫洛托夫于去年底答复“真理报”与“消息报”记者关于伦敦外长会议失败之经过称：由于美英法帝国主义集团企图“取消与欧洲和平安全利益一致的波茨顿、雅尔塔协定”，及“美帝国主义利用西部德国作为冒险侵略基地”，“致使伦敦会议归于失败”。继称：“会议没有达成协议的有两个基本问题”：（一）对德和约问题：苏联认为：“这不只对于德国而且对于一切努力于建立巩固和平的欧洲国家都是一个重大的问题”。因此，“苏联代表团坚持对德和约准备工作不能再有片刻稽延，而且应当立即开始”。然而，“美英法三国代表则不认为对德媾和是伦敦会议的主要问题，甚至力图从议程上完全取消，不可能时即拖延它，把它和其它次要问题纠缠在一起”。（二）重建德国统一问题：“苏联代表团坚决主张立即建立民主德国的临时中央政府，经美英法横加反对后，又建议第一步先设立德国经济中央行政管理部门，因为这不仅关系德国人民的国家生活，而且关系于德国民主化及废除军国主义之在全境实现，并将保证德国对盟国义务之履行”。“然而，美英法代表却把统一的任务，缩小到仅是各占领当局，订立某些为流通货物而取消关税壁垒的协定。其目的只是为了他们底国家的出口公司，便于在德倾销货物”。接着莫氏更进一步揭露美英法破坏德国重建统一的活动称：“最近美英报纸都报导要以占领区准备单独成立德国政府的消息，宪法已经草成了，新货币都在发行”，“现在谁都知道美国想把西部德国造成向欧洲扩张的基地”。“马歇尔计划四年中给西部德国数十亿美元贷款，以使德美两国独占资本家更加和解，共同压榨德国人民及使德国中小工业家陷入更困难的境地”。莫氏指出：根据美国此种计划，自然就丝毫不顾及曾受德国侵略的各国利益，而反对德国履行赔偿义务。显然的，美国拖延组成德国统一政府的时期愈长，则愈使那些执行美国计划的人有更多时间“为所欲为”。最后，莫氏力称：“伦敦会议失败的责任是要由美国统治阶级来担负的，而贝文与比道尔也附和了马歇尔”。"

    "content": "Yuncheng Battle Communication\n  　Battle for the City Wall\n    The troops had just ascended the north city wall of Yuncheng when the enemy immediately counterattacked. Many enemy cannons fired at the breach (the opening in the city wall we had broken), with seven or eight shells exploding simultaneously. Heavy and light machine guns also fired at the same spot, bullets raining down like hail. The breach was shrouded in smoke and fire, making it impossible to see. The enemy desperately tried to block the opening, preventing the People's Liberation Army from entering the city. However, the heroic assault队员were not afraid of this. No matter how intense the firepower, they only advanced and never retreated. Zhao Chengjin was shot in three fingers at the assault point, but he still charged forward regardless. He fired at the enemy without even lying down. After firing just one bullet, the magazine stopped working. Anxious, he realized it had been damaged by the enemy. He quickly replaced the magazine and continued firing with his bloody hands. Under the powerful bombardment of our artillery, the dozen or so enemies standing on the city wall quickly retreated into the smoke and fire. An enemy explosive charge landed in front of Bai Mingsheng. The fuse hissed and sparked. He quickly grabbed the tail of the charge and threw it down at the enemy below, where it landed on the back of an enemy soldier and immediately ignited. The other enemies were frightened and ran away. Then, the enemy charged again. In a very dangerous situation, Yuan Mingting and Che Mengqing stood at the front, firing at the enemy. Soon, they were both wounded, but they continued to throw grenades. Che Mengqing said in a firm voice: \"Comrades! I've been hit, but don't be afraid. Resolutely complete the mission. Insisting for ten more minutes to cover the advance of the troops is our victory.\" This was his second time being wounded. The few remaining comrades looked at each other in the tense situation and said in unison: \"We are determined!\" Before they could finish speaking, more than a dozen enemies rushed up with hand grenades. Our assault队员's machine guns fired incessantly. Jin Deyou, while holding a hand grenade, said to everyone: \"Rather advance an inch than retreat an inch!\" He had just thrown his third hand grenade when a bullet knocked him down. At this moment, no one looked at anyone else, but bravely and calmly threw grenades again. The enemy's several counterattacks on the west side of the north city wall were repelled in this way. The brother troops advancing to the east side of the north city wall simultaneously charged and assaulted the enemy. As soon as the 队员reached the top of the city wall, more than twenty enemies rushed towards them. Mao Deli dispersed them with a barrage of hand grenades, and Wang Zhaowa bravely pursued them, capturing two enemies alive. At this time, the enemy was shooting from inside the bunkers. The assault队员 advanced bravely under the rain of bullets and destroyed two city wall bunkers in a row. The enemy in the third bunker was still resisting stubbornly, so the assault队员 threw in nine bombs, destroying the enemy and the bunker together. Che Fuzhong's face was injured, but he did not leave the front line. He and Zhang Fuliang and three others stood at the front. At this time, six or seven enemies charged over. At the platoon leader's command, a volley of hand grenades was thrown. Che Fuzhong ran out into the smoke and seized an enemy rifle. The enemy retreated, rolling and crawling.\n    Before long, the enemy counterattacked again. From afar, they saw one enemy in the lead, running over menacingly with a shiny saber in his hand. Our assault队员 quietly lay prone on the fortifications, tightly gripping their hand grenades. Before the enemy could get close, they unleashed a barrage of hand grenades, disrupting the enemy's formation. Only the foremost enemy charged forward regardless of his life, raising his saber to slash at Che Fuzhong.

    "content": "【Taiyue News】 In the cooperative of seven villages including Hancun in the Fifth District of Changzi County, class enemies were put in charge, squandering the capital of the masses at will. The Changzi County United Cooperative recently conducted an investigation and found that the cooperatives in seven villages in the Fifth District, including Hancun, Zhangzhuang, Duanzhuang, Northeast Changcun, Northwest Daicun, Hecun, and Baodian, did not organize and lead farmers in production, but instead moved from the villages to the towns to engage in trade. Their reasoning was: there are fewer opportunities to make money in the countryside, and running a cooperative in the town will definitely make money. Looking at the actual situation of the Hecun cooperative, it moved to Baodian Town in the ninth month of the lunar calendar last year to open a dye shop and a grocery store. This cooperative collected 80,000 yuan from the sale of seven dan, two dou, seven sheng, and two ge of grain by the farmers of Hecun. So far, it has only earned 50,000 yuan. After deducting the monthly rent of one dan of rice and the food and drink of the five people in the cooperative, it will still lose 8,360 yuan. If the grain invested by the farmers is calculated according to the current market price, seven dan, two dou, seven sheng, and two ge of rice total 138,168 yuan, then it will lose 66,528 yuan. The remaining six cooperatives have lost a total of 2.68 million yuan so far, equivalent to 140 dan and five sheng of millet. If this grain were given to farmers as capital for winter production, how many production difficulties of hired and poor peasants would be solved? After inspection by the County United Cooperative, it was discovered that there were thirteen class enemies in these seven cooperatives, and one was even serving as the manager. They often ate white flour, wasting the capital of the farmers. Now the County United Cooperative has ordered them all to move back to the villages and be reformed by the farmers.\n\n　　【Shexian News】 The Ninth District United Cooperative was newly established in the twelfth month of the lunar calendar last year, and landlords Zhang Pengming, Li Tianhou, and three others infiltrated it. They thought that others could not do the job and that they were indispensable. They often flaunted their power and status in front of the farmers, putting on airs. When he went home, he rode a horse. When selling things to farmers in the store, he insisted on fixed prices, like the old pawnbrokers. He did business in the cooperative for one penny, make one penny, if there was nothing to be made he wouldn't do it, in the first half of the year every yuan earned a dividend of thirteen cents. The masses reflected that investing in the cooperative was not as good as keeping the money at home. During the review, the landlord Li Tianhou even hid his brother in his cabinet to avoid struggle. They secretly bought more than a dozen fountain pens and did not pay taxes, which resulted in the confiscation of the fountain pens by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. During the three checks, these landlords were squeezed out and replaced with several farmers who showed practical work in all aspects, very actively whether in mass work or business work, one person can do the work of two. The landlords were afraid of work when they were there, now they are looking for work. The landlords made one penny profit with one penny of capital, the current accountant doesn't care whether there is capital or not, he must do the work. There has also been an improvement in cigarette rolling technology. In terms of earning dividends, the landlords earned a dividend of thirteen cents per yuan in the first half of the year. After the landlords were squeezed out, the calculation for four months was that each yuan earned a dividend of more than thirty cents. During the meeting for self-criticism, everyone said: \"Being capable is not as good as being practical.\" Li Sanhai (poor peasant) said: Others did the work, but didn't let us do it, we can't do it, with our skills, just use all of them.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 长子七个村合作社地主把持大赔本\n米换\n1948-01-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　长子七个村合作社地主把持大赔本\n    【太岳消息】长子县五区韩村等七村合作社，叫斗争对象当了家，随便浪费群众本钱。长子县联社最近做了调查，五区有韩村、章庄、段庄、东北常村、西北带村、河村、鲍店七村合作社，不组织领导农民生产，却从村里搬到城里镇上做买卖。他们的理由是：农村赚钱机会少，到城里办合作社一定能赚钱。实际看看河村合作社，从去年阴历九月就搬到鲍店镇开染坊和杂货铺，这个合作社是河村农民卖了七石二斗七升二合粮食集了八万元的本钱，到现在才赚了五万元，除过每一月一石米的房价和社里的五个人的吃喝，还要赔八千三百六十元。要是把农民入股的粮食按现在市价算，七石二斗七升二合米共折十三万八千一百六十八块钱，那就要赔六万六千五百二十八元。其余的六个合作社，到现在共赔了二百六十八万元，合小米一百四十石零五升。如果把这些粮食交给农民做冬季生产的本钱，要解决多少雇贫农的生产困难？县联社经过检查后，发现了这七个合作社里就有十三个斗争对象，还有一个当着经理，他们经常吃的白面，把农民的本钱都浪费了，现在县联社叫他们都搬回村去，让农民改造。\n    【涉县消息】九区区联社是去年阴历腊月新成立的，钻进地主张朋明、李天厚等五人。他们自以为其他人干不了，离了他就不行，在农民面前常抖他的威风，摆他的架子。他回家时骑着马。在门市部卖东西对农民说话是言无二价，象过去的开当铺的。他在社内做生意有一个钱，做一个钱，没有就不干，前半年每元钱赚红利一角三分。群众反映在社里入股还不如在家放着。在复查时地主李天厚还把他兄弟藏在他的柜房里逃避斗争。他们偷买了十几枝钢笔，不给税，结果被工商局查出，钢笔没收了。三查时把这些地主挤走了，换了几个农民干，各方面表现了实干，无论对群众工作、对业务工作都很积极，一个顶两个。地主在是怕有活，现在是找活。地主是一毛本钱做一毛本钱，现在的会计不管有无本钱要干。在卷烟技术上也有提高。在赚红利上，地主在时半年赚红利每元一毛三。地主挤回后，四个月计算，每元赚红利三毛多。在开会检讨时，大家说：“能干不如实干”。李三孩（贫农）说：人家倒干了，就是不给干，咱干不了吧，就咱这些本事，全使上就行。（米换）"

    "content": "Changzhi City Poor People in Xiadong Street\n  　Mobilize Cadres to Withdraw Loans\n    [Changzhi City News] In this loan distribution in Xiadong Street, Changzhi City, a total of 1.9 million yuan was loaned. The loan was distributed by the evaluation committee in early December. The cadres thought there were no problems and that all loans were given to poor peasants and farm laborers. However, after the district cadre meeting on December 17th, it was discovered that there were still eight people in the street who were not actively engaged in production. Seven of these eight people were poor peasants and farm laborers, and one was a middle peasant. When asked about the reason, Yu Jinyi said, \"I borrowed 40,000 yuan, but only took 20,000 yuan. The other 20,000 yuan was borrowed by the evaluation committee for others to use, so I didn't receive it.\" Another household borrowed 20,000 yuan, but couldn't find a way to use it for production, so they lent it to the street chief. After discovering these problems, attention was drawn, and a meeting of key cadres was convened to raise the above two loan issues and let everyone consciously conduct inspections to see what problems existed in the loan distribution. At the cadre meeting, it was found that the loans received by the cadres were unfair. The anti-illiteracy director had been a long-term worker his whole life. After his liberation, because his wife was sick and needed medicine, and then died and needed burial, he spent a lot of money and was worried about not being able to pay off his debts. He wanted to borrow some money, sell his calf, and replace it with a larger animal for transportation, but he only borrowed 40,000 yuan. Branch Secretary Ji Guoji had more than 100,000 yuan in capital, harvested eleven shi of grain, and had enough to eat and spend at home, but he borrowed 50,000 yuan. On the night of the 28th, a meeting of poor people was held to let the masses examine whether this loan distribution was fair. Twenty-four poor households successively raised loan requests. Immediately, the street chief announced a list of households that had received loans, allowing everyone to comment, give opinions, and see who borrowed more, who borrowed less, who should have borrowed, and who shouldn't have. After deliberation, cadres and individual masses who borrowed more money voluntarily reported their withdrawal. For example, Niu Zhihai said, \"My family has two people, harvested fourteen shi of grain, invested 150,000 yuan. My family can't finish eating or spending, so I shouldn't have borrowed. I will return the 20,000 yuan loan and let the truly impoverished peasants and farm laborers borrow it.\" Political Director Ji Guoji said, \"My family has four people, including two children, harvested eleven shi of grain, and have 110,000 yuan in capital. We have a surplus of food and money to spend, so I want to return the 50,000 yuan I borrowed.\" In this way, a total of 385,000 yuan was voluntarily reported for withdrawal. After the voluntary withdrawals, eight evaluators were elected by everyone to carefully evaluate and supplement loans for those who urgently needed loans but didn't receive them or received less. In addition, for unreasonable loans, if the borrowers didn't voluntarily withdraw, the evaluation committee would evaluate and decide whether to withdraw or not. After evaluation, it was decided that eighteen households should not have borrowed, and a total of 455,000 yuan was withdrawn. All these funds were reasonably loaned to poor peasants and farm laborers.

    "content": "U.S. Aggression Against China Over the Past Year\n    ·Wang Zongyi·\n    Over the past year, due to the frantic aggression of U.S. imperialism and the frantic betrayal of the country by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, the KMT-controlled areas have become further colonized.\n    Militarily. The U.S. Military Advisory Group in China has gradually developed into the highest military supervision agency over the Chiang bandit-controlled areas. Since September of last year, the personnel of the Advisory Group have formally controlled and supervised the work of various departments of the Chiang bandit's highest military institution, the Ministry of National Defense. During the period when Wedemeyer came to China, the group also obtained the right to train the Chiang bandit army and is planning to obtain full command of the Chiang bandit army through the establishment of a joint staff. As early as the beginning of the civil war, the United States, through the U.S. military officer corps sent to the Chiang army troops, participated in the command of the Chiang army in some areas. The Chiang-US \"Naval Agreement\" signed on December 8 last year established the U.S. imperialists' regulatory power over the Chiang bandit navy. In addition, the U.S. imperialists have obtained from Chiang Kai-shek the land, sea, and air force bases in Qingdao, Xi'an, Tianshui, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Dihua, Huangpu, Sanzao Island, Yulin Port, and Keelung, Kaohsiung, Taipei, Taichung, and Pingtung in Taiwan, thus forming a network of U.S. aggressive bases in China in the air, sea, and land. The \"note\" of the Chiang bandit Foreign Ministry on October 17 allowing the U.S. military to be stationed in China formally gave Chinese territory to the United States as a U.S. troop garrison. The U.S. Military Advisory Group, U.S. troops stationed, plus the U.S. military base network in China, constitute a complete military supervision system of the United States over the Chiang bandit-controlled areas.\n    Secondly, economically. In terms of finance, in early September, the American Young took office as advisor to the Chiang bandit \"Stabilization Fund Committee,\" obtaining the regulatory power over the Chiang bandit's financial foreign exchange. The Chiang-US \"Relief Agreement\" of October 27 determined the U.S. supervisory power over the Chiang bandit's production, trade, commercial distribution, and finance, and Washington has established a \"China Relief Committee\" to be responsible for implementing this supervisory power. In November, Chiang Kai-shek also gave the customs sovereignty to the United States as collateral for obtaining U.S. loans. In terms of industry, in August last year, Chiang bandit Executive President Zhang Qun's statement on \"foreign investment and technical cooperation in China\" allowed the United States to invest in all light and heavy industrial sectors in the KMT-controlled areas, strengthening and expanding the right of American monopoly capitalists to monopolize Chinese industry. In terms of agriculture, the Chiang bandit government, in order to implement its American master's colonial production plan of \"raw materials China,\" passed a \"Sino-American Agricultural Cooperation Plan for the 37th Year\" in November last year, from agricultural research, agricultural extension, fisheries research, to agricultural education and land surveying, all agricultural sovereignty was betrayed to U.S. imperialism. The United States has also decided to reorganize the Chiang bandit agricultural institutions so that the United States can directly control them. In October, the Chiang bandit authorities, in accordance with U.S. orders, established the \"Rehabilitation Affairs Committee\" to inherit the work of UNRRA in China, which has become a specialized supervisory agency for the United States to supervise Chinese agriculture after UNRRA. The UNRRA authorities have publicly declared that the \"board of directors\" of the association, which is presided over by Americans, has the right to implement \"supervision\" in all aspects of agriculture in the Chiang-controlled areas. As a result of the above-mentioned steps taken by the US-Chiang collusion, the colonial nature of the Chiang-controlled area's economy has become more profound.\n    While the United States stepped up its military and economic aggression against China, U.S. imperialism also particularly strengthened its cultural and ideological aggression against China. Its content is to cover up the aggressive true face of U.S. imperialism by various means of despicable and obscene rumors and deceptions. U.S. imperialists are striving to use fabricated concepts such as \"Sino-American cooperation\" and \"one family in the world\" as an excuse to strangle China's independence. And they have used the long-bankrupt \"anti-communism\" smoke screen to spread shameless slanders such as \"Soviet ambitions for China\" to cover up their aggressive actions against China. The large-scale plunder of China's sovereignty by the United States and the bloody crimes of the United States slaughtering the Chinese people in the hands of Chiang Kai-shek are described as \"maintaining China's freedom and independence,\" and the Chiang family bandits and all American lackeys are portrayed as \"patriotic elements,\" and the true patriotic and democratic elements are slandered as \"not understanding the responsibility of being a national,\" and openly warning the Chinese people that \"there is no need to resist foreign aggression now.\" The die-hard U.S. imperialist, Judd, even publicly called on the Chiang bandit authorities in Nanjing in October to learn from Mussolini and carry out \"lies\" propaganda to the Chinese people. The \"Relief Agreement\" specifically stipulates that the Chiang bandit authorities must use all their strength to carry out \"full and continuous propaganda about American aid\" in order to fool the Chinese national consciousness. In particular, the U.S.-China Education Fund Agreement signed on November 10 decided to establish a \"U.S. Education Foundation in China\" completely controlled by Americans as the highest supervisory agency for U.S. cultural education to the Chiang bandits, so as to thoroughly transform Chinese education into colonial slave education in accordance with U.S. imperialist viewpoints. The U.S. imperialists were overjoyed because Chiang Kai-shek had completely sold out the sovereignty of Chinese cultural education, believing that this was a \"model of understanding\" obtained by the United States at a \"low price\" between it and its lackeys, and that its lackey Chiang Kai-shek actively supported the U.S. imperialist \"world education center status\" as the \"first important step\" (U.S. Minneapolis Tribune Morning News editorial).\n    In addition to the above three aspects of military, economic, and cultural, the Chiang bandit authorities have also given the supervisory power of Chinese judicial administration to U.S. imperialism. The American Pound took office as advisor to the Chiang bandit Ministry of Justice and Administration at the end of September, responsible for completely transforming China's code. The U.S. Embassy in China has long become the center of U.S. regulatory activities over the Chiang bandit regime, and the embassy's agricultural counselors, cultural specialists, financial counselors, and military counselors directly participate in the Chiang bandit's internal affairs. U.S. imperialism, through its embassy in China, directs every political action of the Chiang bandit authorities. In the past year, the suppression and destruction of the patriotic democratic movement in the Chiang area, the playing of the pseudo-\"National Congress,\" and many other political conspiracies of the Chiang bandit authorities were all carried out under U.S. guidance.\n    In the past year, U.S. imperialism has also stepped up its support for Japanese aggression forces as a tool for U.S. aggression against China. In August last year, the United States ordered the Chiang bandit authorities to open trade with Japan, the purpose of which was to make China still a dumping market for Japanese goods and a supplier of raw materials. The Chiang bandit authorities have now decided to send their first and second batches of trade representatives to Japan in order to profit the four major families from the sale of national blood. U.S. imperialism is trying to form a Far East economic group, including its Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, and Korean lackeys into one, as a convenient form for the United States to enslave the entire Asia and the Far East, and especially to enslave the Chinese people. The United States has brought Japanese aggression forces back to Taiwan. Under the encouragement of MacArthur, the Japanese warlords have re-issued their arrogant demands for Chinese territory. MacArthur is prepared to make the Japanese warlords re-assume the task of \"guarding China.\"\n    The reason why Chiang Kai-shek is so actively selling out national sovereignty at all costs is to exchange for U.S. aid to support his anti-people civil war. The purpose of U.S. imperialism is to exchange China's national sovereignty from Chiang Kai-shek in exchange for U.S. money. However, the greedy and stingy U.S. usurer, its policy is to exchange as much Chinese sovereignty as possible for as little U.S. money as possible. The deeper Chiang Kai-shek's rule crisis becomes, the harsher the conditions for U.S. aid become. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek, the U.S. slave, is selling China more and more cheaply. In order to obtain 27.7 million U.S. dollars of U.S. supplies, Chiang Kai-shek gave the United States all the supervisory power of China's production, trade, commercial distribution, and its finances, and promised to carry out \"gratitude\" propaganda for the United States. In order to beg for further U.S. assistance, Chiang Kai-shek simply sold out China's customs and completely auctioned off Taiwan, but what the United States continued to give Chiang Kai-shek was only the temporary assistance of a mere 18 million U.S. dollars passed by the U.S. Congress on December 19. Apart from this, what Chiang Kai-shek received from the United States in the past year was the 60 million U.S. dollars of military ammunition loans granted by the U.S. dog, the Canadian government, in September, and a series of U.S. weapons and ammunition sold by the United States, and the seventeen Japanese military factories given in the form of Japanese reparations materials. U.S. financial tycoons believe that selling arms to Chiang Kai-shek is a good deal, which can both make money and slaughter the Chinese people. This is also the reason why U.S. imperialism actively advocates increasing military aid to Chiang. In order to destroy China, U.S. imperialists will never stop or relax their aid to Chiang Kai-shek, and Chiang Kai-shek, in order to exchange U.S. aid to save his life, will sell out China more shamelessly and thoroughly.\n    In the face of Chiang Kai-shek's military defeat and his deepening rule crisis, U.S. imperialists have shifted the focus of their aggression against China to South China and Southwest China. While the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary rule in Northeast China, North China, and even Central China is coming to an end, he has sold the rights and interests of the entire South China and Southwest China to the United States as a gift to his American master for continuing to support his dying rule. When Wedemeyer came to China for inspection, he made a thorough inspection of South China and suggested that South China be used as a U.S.-Chiang ruling base. The United States has shown special concern for the form of the political power in South China. Song Ziwen's appointment as chairman of the Chiang bandit Guangdong Province, and then being appointed as director of the Chiang bandit Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters, came from the U.S. plan. The purpose of the U.S. collusion with the Chiang bandit authorities to instigate the \"peace movement\" conspiracy in South China by Song Ziwen and others is also to vainly attempt to maintain the US-Chiang feudal colonial rule in South China. Recently, the investment and inspection of Americans in Guangdong, Hunan and other places, the construction of railways such as Yuehan, Xiang-Gui-Qian, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Chengdu-Chongqing, Sichuan-Kang-Yunnan under the supervision of Americans, and the expansion of the US sea and air base network in South China all show the intensification of American aggression in South China and Southwest China. Related to the US aggression activities in South China is the strengthening of the US forces in Taiwan. Chiang Kai-shek has agreed to the US to completely occupy Taiwan and include it in the US occupation system in Japan.\n    But no matter what assistance U.S. imperialism gives to Chiang Kai-shek, or what other struggling steps it takes, the dying fate of US-Chiang rule in China cannot be reversed. The United States once gave Chiang Kai-shek more than 4 billion U.S. dollars in aid, trying to eliminate the Chinese people's democratic independence movement, but the result was Chiang Kai-shek's military defeat and the emergence of a new upsurge in the national anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution in China, which moved Chiang Kai-shek to the edge of the grave. Although U.S. imperialism now seems to have understood that Chiang Kai-shek's army commanded and equipped by the United States is \"nothing more than a transshipment personnel of U.S. weapons\" (Washington Post), understands that the end result of U.S. aid to Chiang Kai-shek will only be worse than the end result of aid to the Greek reactionaries (New York Herald Tribune), and understands that \"neither U.S. money nor U.S. weapons will give Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist war much support\" (Associated Press), but U.S. imperialists have no other way but to continue to follow the old path of assisting Chiang Kai-shek and drag Chiang Kai-shek and U.S. rule in China into the grave. As for the great goal of the Chinese people's struggle, it is to completely liberate the whole of China, completely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous rule, completely sweep the forces of imperialism out of China, and this infinitely bright day is not far away.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 一年来美国的侵华活动\n王宗一\n1948-01-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　一年来美国的侵华活动\n    ·王宗一·\n    过去一年来，由于美帝国主义的疯狂侵略，和卖国贼蒋介石的疯狂卖国，蒋管区已更进一步地殖民地化。\n    在军事上。驻华美国军事顾问团，已逐渐发展为对蒋匪统治区的最高军事监督机关。顾问团人员自去年九月起，正式控制及监督了蒋匪最高军事机构国防部各部门工作。该团在魏德迈来华时期，又取得了对蒋匪陆军的训练权，并正计划经过建立联合参谋部的步骤，获取对蒋匪军队的全部指挥权。早在内战初期，美国即经过其派往蒋军部队中的美军将校干部队，参与了若干地区的蒋军指挥。去年十二月八日签订的蒋美“海军协定”，又确立了美帝国主义对蒋匪海军的监管权。此外，美帝国主义已从蒋介石手中取得青岛、西安、天水、兰州、成都、迪化、黄埔、三灶岛、榆林港以及台湾的基隆、高雄、台北、台中、屏东等陆海空军基地，从而组成了美国在华空中、海上和陆上侵略基地网。十月十七日蒋匪外交部允许美军驻华的“照会”，正式把中国领土送给美国作为美国屯兵场。美国军事顾问团，美国驻军，加上美国在华军事基地网，就构成了美国对蒋匪统治区的整套军事监管体系。\n    其次是经济上。财政金融方面，九月初美人杨格就任蒋匪“平准基金委员会”顾问，取得了对蒋匪金融外汇的监督权。十月二十七日的蒋美“救济协定”，确定了美国对于蒋匪生产、贸易、商业分配以及财政的监督权，华盛顿方面已成立“中国救济委员会”，负责执行此项监督权。十一月间蒋介石又把海关主权送给了美国，当作取得美国贷款的抵押品。工业方面，去年八月蒋匪行政院长张群关于“外人来华投资及技术合作”的声明，允许美国投资蒋管区一切轻重工业部门，加强和扩大了美国独占资本家垄断中国工业的权利。农业方面，蒋匪政府为执行其美国主子之“原料中国”殖民地生产计划，已于去年十一月间通过一“三十七年度中美农业合作计划方案”，从农业研究、农业推广、水产研究，直到农业教育、土地测量，全部农业主权，都断送给美国帝国主义。美国并已决定将蒋匪农业机构加以改组，以便美国直接控制。十月间蒋匪当局依照美国命令成立用以继承联总在华工作的“善后事业委员会”，已继联总之后成为美国对中国农业的专门监督机关，联总当局已公开声明由美人参加主持之该会“董事会”，有对蒋管区农业实行各方面“监督”之权利。由于美蒋勾结实行上述各项步骤的结果，蒋管区经济上的殖民地性质，已更加深刻。\n    与美国加紧实行军事和经济侵华同时，美帝国主义并特别加强了对于中国的文化思想侵略。其内容，就是以各种卑污下流的造谣欺骗手段，掩饰美帝国主义的侵略真面目。美帝国主义者努力以“中美合作”“天下一家”等杜撰的观念，作为绞杀中国独立的借口。并袭用早已破产了的“反共产主义”烟幕，散布所谓“苏联对中国的野心”等无耻诽谤，掩饰其侵华行动。将美国对中国主权的大肆掠夺，和美国假手蒋介石屠杀中国人民的血腥罪行，描述为“维护中国自由与独立”，将蒋家匪帮及一切美国走狗形容为“爱国分子”，将真正的爱国民主分子诬蔑为“不懂得作国民的责任”，并公然警告中国人民“现在不需要再抵抗外来侵略”。美国死硬帝国主义分子楚德，十月间且曾在南京公开号召蒋匪当局学墨索里尼的样子，向中国人民进行“谎言”宣传。“救济协定中”，特别规定了蒋匪当局必须用一切力量进行“关于美国援助之充分与不断之宣传”，以愚弄中国民族意识。尤其是十一月十日签订的美国对华教育基金协定，决定成立一完全由美人掌握的“美国在华教育基金会”，作为美国对蒋匪文化教育的最高监督机关，以便按照美帝国主义观点，将中国教育彻底改造为殖民地奴隶教育。美帝国主义者因为蒋介石对中国文化教育主权的全部出卖，而喜不自禁，认为这是美国以“低廉之代价”与其走狗间所获得的“谅解之模范”，是其走狗蒋介石积极支持美帝国主义“世界教育中心地位”的“第一重要步骤”（美国密尼亚波利斯论坛晨报社论）。\n    除以上军事、经济、文化三方面外，蒋匪当局并已将中国司法行政的监督权送给了美帝国主义。美人庞德已于九月底就任蒋匪司法行政部顾问，负责全部改造中国的法典。驻华美国大使馆，则早已成为美国对蒋匪政权的监管活动中心，大使馆农业参赞、文化专员、财政参赞及军事参赞等，皆直接参与蒋匪内政事务。美帝国主义通过其驻华大使馆，指挥着蒋匪当局的每一个政治行动。过去一年中，蒋匪当局对于蒋区爱国民主运动的镇压摧残，伪“国大”的扮演，以及其他许多政治阴谋，无一不是在美国指导下进行的。\n    在过去一年中，美帝国主义并加紧扶植日本侵略势力，作为美国侵华工具。去年八月间美国命令蒋匪当局开放对日贸易，其目的即为使中国照旧成为日本商品的倾销市场和原料供应地。蒋匪当局现已决定将其第一、二批贸易代表派往日本，以便从出卖民族鲜血中，为四大家族牟利。美帝国主义正力图组成远东经济集团，将其中、日、菲、韩走狗包容于一体，作为美国奴役整个亚洲及远东，而特别是奴役中国人民的简便形式，美国已将日本侵略势力重新带到台湾。日本军阀在麦克阿瑟鼓励下，重新发出了对中国领土的狂妄要求。麦克阿瑟已准备使日本军阀重新担负起“警卫中国”的任务。\n    蒋介石之所以这样积极的不惜一切的出卖国家主权，是为的换取美国援助，支持其反人民的内战。而美帝国主义的目的，也正是为了以美国金元从蒋介石手中换取中国国家主权。但贪婪而吝啬的美国高利贷者，它所持的政策，是以尽量少的美国钱换取尽量多的中国主权。蒋介石的统治危机愈是加深，美国的援助的条件就愈是苛刻。因此美国奴才蒋介石的出卖中国，也愈来愈廉价。为取得二千七百七十万美元的美国物资，蒋介石一下子就把中国生产、贸易、商业分配及其财政的监督权，全部送给美国帝国主义，并答应为美国进行“感恩”宣传。为乞求美国进一步的援助，蒋介石又干脆出卖了中国的海关，并全部拍卖了台湾，但美国继续给蒋介石的，就只是十二月十九日美国国会所通过的临时援助区区一千八百万美元。除此以外，过去一年中，蒋介石从美国手中所得到的，就是九月间美国走狗加拿大政府所给予的六千万美元军火贷款，和美国连续售给的一些美国武器和军火，以及以日本赔价物资形式给予的十七座日本兵工厂。美国财阀认为出售军火给蒋介石是一个好买卖，既能赚钱，又能屠杀中国人民，这也正是美国帝国主义积极主张增加军事援蒋的原因。美帝国主义者为了灭亡中国，是决不会停止或放松对于蒋介石的援助的，而蒋介石为了换取美国援助救命，将会更无耻更彻底地出卖中国。\n    在蒋介石军事失败和其统治危机日益加深的情况下，美帝国主义者已将侵华的重点转向华南和中国西南。汉奸蒋介石在其东北、华北甚至华中的反革命统治正在走向末路的时候，将整个华南和西南的权益出卖给美国，作为对其美国主子继续支持其垂死统治的献礼。魏德迈来华考察时，曾在华南作了周密的考察，并建议将华南作为蒋美统治基地。美国对华南政权形式表现了特别的关心，宋子文之出任蒋匪广东省主席，和接着被任为蒋匪广州行辕主任，即出自美国之计划。美国勾结蒋匪当局嗾使宋子文等所进行的华南“和平运动”阴谋，其目的亦在妄图保持华南美蒋封建殖民地统治。最近美人在两广、湖南等地之投资和考察粤汉、湘桂黔、浙赣、成渝、川康滇等铁路之由美人督令修建，华南美海空基地网之扩展，皆表现美国对华南及西南侵略之加紧。与美国华南侵略活动相联系着的，是美国在台湾势力之加强，蒋介石已同意美国完全占有台湾，并将之包括入美国在日本的占领体系中。\n    但不管美帝国主义还给蒋介石什么援助，或采取另外的什么挣扎步骤，美蒋在中国的统治的死亡命运是已经不能挽回了。美国曾经给了蒋介石四十多万万美元的援助，试图消灭中国人民的民主独立运动，但其结果，是蒋介石的军事失败和中国全国反帝反封建革命新高潮的出现，是把蒋介石搬到了坟墓的边缘。美帝国主义虽然现在似乎已经领会到：美国指挥和美国装备的蒋介石军队“无非是美国武器的转运人员”（华盛顿邮报），领会到美国援助蒋介石的结局只会比援助希腊反动派的结局更坏些（纽约先驱论坛报），领会到“不论是美国金钱还是美国武器都不会使蒋介石的反共战争有多大支撑力了”（美联社），但美帝国主义者却毫无别的办法，只能继续沿着援助蒋介石的这条老路，把蒋介石和美国的在华统治拖进坟墓里去。至于中国人民斗争的伟大目标，则是彻底解放全中国，彻底消灭蒋介石的卖国统治，把帝国主义的势力完全扫除出中国，而且这个无限光明的日子已经为期不远了。"

    "content": "Stop Cadres from Monopolizing and Distributing the Fruits of Victory Arbitrarily\nAct According to the Land Law, Otherwise it is Illegal\n\n[This Newspaper's News] In some areas of Taihang, the fruits of victory are being investigated and distributed to hired and poor peasants to boost winter production. Why have these fruits not been distributed for so long? Is the current distribution truly for the benefit of hired and poor peasants? Is the distribution completely fair and in line with the spirit of the Land Law? Has the class line of mobilizing hired and poor peasants truly been followed? These questions are not explained in the correspondent's submission. This distribution of fruits is being carried out through a top-down cadre line. In many places, landlords and rich peasants are still manipulating the major power in the villages. The rich peasant line and the style of suppressing the masses among the cadres have not been resolved, and the hired and poor peasants have not yet been emancipated. Under these circumstances, a very hasty distribution will certainly not truly satisfy the demands of the hired and poor peasants, and it will not be able to comply with the spirit of the Outline Land Law of China. From the perspective of the long-term interests of hired and poor peasants, rural workers, and all peasants with little or no land, this approach is not good. The following are various materials provided for everyone to study.\n\nLucheng's Fifth District held a village cadre meeting on the 27th of last month to inspect winter production and found that many hired and poor peasants were unable to participate in production. \"Li Yuzhe was a hired peasant, and he was not thoroughly emancipated during the movement. The village cadres mobilized him to repair the road, but he did not go. The cadres all said he was lazy and had a hedonistic mentality. Later, after the cadres talked to him individually, they discovered that the reason he was unwilling to go out to work was because he had no quilt to cover himself with.\" Afterwards, the cadres began to examine themselves. Gao Renbao, the village chief of Gaozhuang Village, said: \"I have been emancipated, bought a big mule, and only care about my own production, forgetting the poor.\" \"Everyone unanimously agreed that they should not blame the hired and poor peasants for not participating in production, but that the cadres themselves had not gone deep enough to solve their difficulties.\" Everyone proposed distributing the remaining fruits of struggle. According to the district's statistics, there are currently 10,860,500 yuan of fruits of victory, which will be completely distributed to the hired and poor masses as production funds. In addition, 8,692,000 yuan of fruits of victory previously placed in the cooperative will be distributed to the hired and poor masses as production funds.\n\n\tIt is the Cadres Who Solve the Difficulties of Hired and Poor Peasants\n\nThe shares of the Nanzhuang Cooperative in Changzhi's Second District are mostly fruits of struggle. Various physical objects are estimated to be worth 1,763,000 yuan at current market prices. A total of 283,000 yuan was invested by the whole village, including 44 households of hired and poor peasants, 64 households of middle peasants, 21 households of rich middle peasants, 6 households of rich peasants, and 23 households of struggle targets. The hired and poor peasants suffered a great loss due to profit sharing according to shares. There are two accountants, one is Jin Shuanghao, a member of the \"Three People's Principles Youth League,\" and the other is Wang Zhaohai, who has \"three guarantees.\" Wang Zhaohai has been an accountant in the village for more than 20 years, not working, and has been in power in the village. They messed up the cooperative completely. The total gross profit was 399,900 yuan, and their food expenses alone were 399,900 yuan. On the 23rd, a meeting of 75 hired and poor peasant households was held, and it was decided to distribute all the fruits of the cooperative to the hired and poor peasants and the families of revolutionary martyrs who had no labor force. Everyone said: \"This is great, the government is really seeking benefits for us!\"\n\n\tThe Government Convened a Meeting of Hired and Poor Peasants and Distributed the Fruits All at Once\n\nA meeting of hired and poor peasants was held in Zhengzhao Village, Shahe. \"Everyone clearly realized that they had suffered a great loss in the past because they had no power.\" It was decided to \"take out the things from the farmers' association and use them as capital for us.\" Zhang Ju said: \"There are trees and wood in the farmers' association. Let's form a small wood factory, so we can have work and firewood. We must also discuss together how to use the money, and how much each person should use. We guarantee that we will not waste it or eat what we buy with the money. The fruits of the farmers' association and the village finances should be sorted out quickly, and as much as is sorted out should be taken out first and handed over to us for production.\" \"The next day, the village cadres started to sort things out...\" After a whole day, the farmers' association had sorted out the following: trees worth 500,000 yuan, 300,000 yuan used by the militia grocery store, three cypress coffins, 200 kilograms of tin, 100 kilograms of cotton seeds, three bags of black beans, two gold rings, and one gold hairpin. In addition, the masses also borrowed 100,000 yuan in cash. Other items need to be quickly converted into cash. The village cadres examined themselves and said: \"We didn't see these people in the past, it's our fault for being shortsighted.\"\n\n\tThe Village Chief Breaks Through the Thinking of the Poor and Hired Peasants Before Distributing the Fruits Again\n\nVillage cadres in Gaoyi's Second District held a meeting to inspect winter production. Talking about future practices, the village chief of Qianzhuangtou Village said: \"Go back and hold a meeting of hired and poor peasants first, break through their thinking, and organize the hired and poor peasants who have not participated. All the fruits of the cooperative should be returned and given to the hired and poor peasants who cannot produce.\" The head of the @Shan Cooperative said at the meeting: \"Go back and return all the fruits of struggle from the cooperative and distribute them to the hired and poor peasants who cannot produce. We must not abuse the fruits like we did before, using the fruits of struggle to make up for all the expenses of the village and to patch up the loopholes of middle peasants.\"\n\n\tOur Opinion\n\nThe fact that the broad masses of hired and poor peasants have not been thoroughly emancipated and are expressing dissatisfaction in winter production, demanding to be masters of their own affairs, and demanding a reasonable distribution of the fruits of victory is an extremely gratifying phenomenon. This enthusiasm is extremely valuable and is the foundation for the victory of implementing the Land Law. Li Shuangli, an old-time farmhand in Zhengzhao Village, Shahe, said it well: \"It's not that we couldn't do it in the past, it's that we had no power.\" The hired and poor peasants' demand to \"be masters of their own affairs\" and \"liberate themselves\" is completely consistent with the spirit of the Land Law and the Central Bureau's Land Conference's regulations to \"organize farmers' associations and farmers' representative conferences with poor peasants as the foundation\" and \"all power belongs to the farmers' representative conferences.\" The \"cadre monopoly,\" \"condescending viewpoint,\" and \"top-down organization of hired and poor peasant meetings to break through their thinking\" mentioned in this news are all wrong and not in line with the class line. They cannot form a class force with hired and poor peasants as the backbone to fight against landlords and rich peasants and fully satisfy the demands of the peasants. We believe that today, when the Land Law has been promulgated, everything should be done in accordance with the spirit of the Land Law and the Central Bureau's Land Conference. All methods that violate the Land Law are called \"illegal.\" It is best to leave the undistributed fruits in a thorough and equal distribution. The difficulties of hired and poor peasants in winter production can be solved by seeking solutions from loans. In some places where there are special difficulties and distribution is unavoidable, it is necessary to consult the higher authorities with extreme caution and responsibility and act in accordance with the principles of the Chinese Land Law. Here, we want to remind everyone that after the Land Law is promulgated, some cadres may be eager to push the fruits that have not been distributed for many years to the hired and poor peasants in a perfunctory manner to cover up their past mistakes. This is illegal and criminal behavior, and if discovered, they will be held accountable in the future. We also hope that cadres and correspondents in various places will reflect all thoughts and practices that violate the Land Law with a responsible attitude towards the people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 停止干部包办乱分果实　要按土地法办事，否则便是违法\n\n1948-01-11\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　停止干部包办乱分果实\n  　要按土地法办事，否则便是违法\n    【本报消息】太行有些地方，正在清查果实，分给雇贫农闹冬季生产。这些果实为什么好长时间没有分？现在才分，到底是不是真正为了雇贫的利益？分的是不是完全公道合乎土地法精神？是不是真正走了发动雇贫的阶级路线？在通讯员的来稿中，这些问题都没有说明，这次分配果实，是通过自上而下的干部路线来进行的，不少地方地主富农仍在操纵村里大权，干部中富农路线及压制群众作风没有解决，雇贫仍未翻身。在这种情形下，来一个十分草率的分配，可以肯定的说，绝不会真正的满足雇贫的要求，更无法符合中国土地法大纲的精神。从雇贫农、乡村工人及一切少地无地农民的长久利益来打算，这样做，是不好的。下面是各种材料提供大家研究。\n    潞城五区在上月二十七日召开村干部会议，检查冬季生产，发现有好多雇贫没法参加生产。“李玉则是雇农出身，在运动中没有翻透身。村干部动员他去修路，他不去。干部都说他是懒汉，有享乐思想。后来经过干部和他个别谈话，发现了不愿出门干活的原因是没有被子盖。”以后干部就检讨起来，高庄村长高仁保说：“自己翻了身，买上了大骡子，只管自己生产，倒把穷人忘了。”“大家一致认为不该怨雇贫不参加生产，是干部自己没有深入给他们解决困难”。大家提出分配遗留的斗争果实。据全区的统计现存果实洋一千零八十六万零五百元，完全分给雇贫群众作为生产资金。另把以前放到合作社的果实八百六十九万二千元分给雇贫群众，作为生产资金。\n    　　　　是干部解决雇贫困难\n    长治二区南庄合作社的股金大部是斗争果实，各种实物按现在市价估计，能值一百七十六万三千元。全村共入股二十八万三千多元，里面有四十四户雇贫、六十四户中农、二十一户富中农、六户富农、二十三户斗争对象入股，按股分红，雇贫吃了大亏。里面有两个会计，一个是“三青团”靳双好，一个是“三保险”王招孩，王招孩过去在村上当了二十多年会计，不劳动，在村上就掌权。他们把合作社弄得一塌糊涂，总共赚了毛利三十九万九千多元，他们的伙食开支就有三十九万九千多元。在二十三日，召开了七十五户雇贫会议，决定把合作社所有果实，全部分配给雇贫与没劳力军烈属。大家说：“这可好啦，政府真是给咱谋利益哩！”\n    　　　　政府召开雇贫会议一下子就把果实分了\n    沙河正招村开了雇贫会议，“大家明确认识到过去自己没权吃了大亏。”决定“把农会的东西拿出来给咱当本钱”。张具的说：“农会里有树和木材，咱们伙成小木厂，又有活作又有柴烧。使钱也要咱们共同研究，看谁该使多少，就使多少。保证不能浪费或把钱买的吃了。农会果实和村财政要快整理，整出多少就先拿出来交给咱搞生产。”“第二天村干部们就下手整理……”经过一整天的时间，农会已整出的有：树木共值五十万元，民兵杂货铺用款三十万元，三个柏木棺材、锡二百斤、籽花一百斤、黑豆三布袋、金戒指两个、金簪子一个，另外群众还借用现款十万元。其他要迅速变款，村干部们检讨道：“过去咱就没有看见这伙人，可怨咱们眼光错了”。\n    　　　　村长打通贫雇思想再分果实\n    高邑二区村干部开会检查冬季生产，谈到今后的作法，前庄头村长说：“回去先开雇贫农会议，打通思想，把没有参加的雇贫也组织起来，合作社果实，一律退出，还给无法生产的雇贫”。＠珊合作社长在会上这样说：“回去把合作社的斗争果实，一律退出，分给无法生产的雇贫农。不能象以前那样；愁不愁，斗争果实一块肉的滥用果实，来补村上一切开支，补中农被门户窟窿。”\n    　　　　我们的意见\n    广大雇贫农翻身不彻底，在冬季生产中表示不满，要求当家，要求合理分配果实，是极其可喜的现象，这种热情极其宝贵，是执行土地法的胜利基础，沙河正招村几十年老长工李双立说的好：“过去也不是咱不能干，是咱没有权的过”。雇贫要求“当家”，“自己解放自己”，这种要求与土地法的精神及中央局土地会议“以贫农作为基础组织农会及农代会”，“一切权力归农代会”的规定，是完全一致的。这个消息中指的“干部包办”，“恩赐观点”，“自上而下的组织雇贫会议打通思想”等作法都不对，不是阶级路线，不能形成以雇贫为骨干的阶级力量来向地主富农斗争，来充分满足农民要求。我们认为在土地法已经公布的今天，一切都应按土地法及中央局土地会议的精神办事，一切违犯土地法的办法都叫“违法”，各地未分的果实，最好留在彻底平分中合理分配，雇贫农冬季生产困难，可从贷款中想办法，有些地方有特殊困难，非分不可，那就要极其慎重极其负责地请示上级，按照中国土地法原则来办，在这里，我们要提醒大家，土地法公布后，可能有一部分干部急于把长年不分的果实马马虎虎地推给雇贫，掩盖自己过去的错误，这是违法犯罪行为，如有发现，将来一定追究。并希望各地干部及通讯员以对人民负责的态度，反映一切违背土地法的思想和做法。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Front, 9th: Generals Liu and Deng recently called on the People's Liberation Army and local cadres at a cadre meeting to establish a style and atmosphere of hard work, plain living, seeking truth from facts, and doing good deeds for the masses; and to oppose extravagance, waste, luxury, and not doing good deeds for the masses. Generals Liu and Deng emphasized: \"If we can do this, we will bring blessings to the people for generations to come; otherwise, we will cause endless harm to the people.\" They also cited the experience of the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan in North China, saying: \"Which troops and which regions are hardworking and simple, which troops and regions have good ties with the people, and they themselves are more developed and consolidated, and make greater contributions to the Party and the people.\" They also said: \"Our troops are a military force, but also a political force. Because the troops are large in number and powerful, and because the people have a high degree of faith in the People's Liberation Army, the local and people often take the habits of the troops as their habits, and shift with the style of the troops, even imitating and learning from every move, speech, clothing, walking, and eating of the troops.\" Therefore, they called on comrades in the troops and local organs to be conscientious and consider the long term at the beginning of the establishment of new liberated areas, otherwise the bad style will affect and infect the people and the local area, which is difficult to correct, and we must be very vigilant.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Front, 9th: The \"Military and Political Exchanges\" published by the Political Department of the Eyuwan People's Liberation Army published an article calling on the front-line troops to implement Liu and Deng's instructions on establishing a style and atmosphere of hard work and plain living, saying: The establishment of a democratic base area, revolving around the two major tasks of winning battles and carrying out land reform, has a lot of things to do, but the most profound thing that runs through all tasks and all work is the issue of style and atmosphere. If the style and atmosphere are not good, even if there is a correct political direction, it is difficult to achieve, or even impossible to achieve. The style and atmosphere are issues related to the century-old plan of the liberated areas. The military and civilians of the liberated areas have a unique new style and atmosphere of hard work, plain living, revitalization, creation, and serving the people, which is completely opposite to the decadent style and atmosphere of corruption, extravagance, hypocrisy, arrogance, licentiousness, exaggeration, and despotism under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek bandits in old China. But we should be vigilant at all times and carry out resolute and continuous struggle against bad styles such as exaggeration and extravagance. It also said: Our army has entered the Dabie Mountains and fought a great battle with the enemy and difficulties, and overcome many difficulties, but we should further examine whether we have considered the long term in our thinking, whether we have deeply realized that the quality of the style will have a huge impact on the liberated areas, and what bad influences we have given to the local and people should be overcome? What good influences should we play? For example, our political discipline, our work of mobilizing the masses to distribute grain and property, which can give the masses the best influence, have we achieved this requirement?

Professors from Peking University and the private China College both demanded that their salaries be adjusted according to the cost of living index. The joint telegram from the Peking University faculty and staff union stated: \"Those with a base salary of 200 yuan (equivalent to 1.2 million yuan in Chiang's currency) earn less than ten yuan before the war.

General Liu Yalou, Chief of Staff of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, reported on the victory. In an extremely excited tone, he first explained that since the winter offensive began on December 15th, the bandit leader Chen Cheng had been thrown into a panic. In the past, Chiang Kai-shek bandits would defend cities with a battalion or a regiment, but now they had to use a division or an army to defend them, but still could not avoid the fate of being wiped out. He then described how recently Chiang Kai-shek bandits concentrated 20 divisions of troops between Shenyang, Xinmin, and Faku, attempting to struggle desperately, but were finally annihilated by us in one fell swoop, eliminating two full divisions and one army headquarters. Although there were as many as seven divisions in nearby units, only 20 li away, they only shrank back and dared not provide assistance. General Liu's speech was often interrupted by applause. Finally, the conference unanimously passed a telegram to the front-line soldiers expressing their respect. The congratulatory telegram stated briefly: We will continue to strengthen various tasks in the rear, redoubling our efforts to fully support the front line, and work together under the central government's call to \"strive for the complete liberation of the Northeast.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: According to Tianjin newspaper reports: Under the powerful winter offensive of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Shenyang are extremely panicked, and prices are soaring. At the end of last month, the Chiang Kai-shek authorities used five military aircraft to airlift a small number of senior officials and their families to escape. Sun Yueqi, the Vice Chairman of the Chiang Kai-shek Resources Committee and a watchdog of the Four Big Families, was still in a state of panic when he fled from Shenyang to Beiping. He confessed, \"The so-called dismantling of industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast has become a thing of the past. People can't even be evacuated, let alone machines?\" The morale and prices in Shenyang City also fluctuated greatly. In just one or two days, rice rose from 60,000 yuan per jin of Chiang Kai-shek currency to 90,000 yuan (that is, 9 million yuan per dan), and sorghum rice rose from 38,000 yuan per jin to more than 45,000 yuan. Rice looting is becoming increasingly fierce. On the 21st of last month, when a rice truck passed through the urban area, hundreds of elderly, weak, women and children swarmed up and snatched 44 bags. Those who took risks at night were active everywhere.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 哈市庆祝沈北大捷　吓得沈阳蒋匪非常恐慌\n\n1948-01-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　哈市庆祝沈北大捷\n  　吓得沈阳蒋匪非常恐慌\n    【新华社东北九日电】哈尔滨市各机关团体代表七日晚在兆麟电影院庆祝沈北公主屯全部歼灭蒋匪一个军部两个整师的大捷。东北解放军参谋长刘亚楼将军报告胜利经过。他以极其兴奋口吻首先说明十二月十五日冬季攻势开始后，打得匪首陈诚张惶失措。过去蒋匪以一个营一个团守卫城市，现在则要用一个师一个军来守卫，但仍不能避免覆灭命运。随即叙述最近蒋匪以廿个师兵力，集中在沈阳、新民、法库之间，妄图拼死挣扎，终于仍被我一举歼灭其两个整师和一个军部，而在邻近部队虽有七个师之多，相距只有廿里，却只是向后龟缩，不敢援救。刘参谋长讲话时，常被掌声打断。最后大会一致通过致电前线将士表示敬意。贺电略称：我们将继续加强后方各种工作，百倍紧张起来，以全力支援前线，在中央“为完全解放东北而奋斗”的号召下，共同努力。\n    【新华社陕北九日电】据津报消息：在东北人民解放军强大冬季攻势下，沈阳蒋匪极度恐慌，物价猛烈上涨。上月底一天之间蒋匪当局即以五架军用机空运少数高级官员及眷属逃跑。四大家族看家狗蒋匪资委会副委员长孙越崎自沈逃抵北平时，犹惊惶不已。供称“所谓东北拆迁工矿问题已成过去，人都撤不出来，还谈得上机器？”沈市人心物价亦随之大动，仅一、二日之间大米即由蒋币每斤六万元涨至九万元（即每担合九百万元），高粱米每斤由三万八千元涨至四万五千余元。抢米风潮日益炽盛，上月二十一日有米车经过市区，百余老弱妇孺即蜂拥而上，抢去四十四包，夜间挺而走险者四出活动。"

    "content": "Jing County, Qilizhuang\n  　Poor Peasants Have Never Received Fruit and Still Borrow Grain from Landlords\n    [Jinan News] In Houqilizhuang, Jing County, the land reform in the seventh district was not thorough in the past. Poor peasants are still not eating enough or wearing warm clothes. They are bullied by landlords and live a life of suffering. Wen Yunrong is sixty-two years old. From the age of seventeen, he worked as a laborer until he was fifty-nine. His family of six, with an eldest daughter of fifteen, a youngest son of seven, old and young, none of whom could work. They cultivated eighteen mu of alkaline land, and the harvest was very small. Every spring, they took their children to beg for food. They did not receive any fruits during the mass movement, and this year's harvest only gave them enough to eat for the winter. In winter, the whole family only has two ragged quilts. The adults feel sorry for the children and cover them with the quilts, while the couple lies naked on the reed mat. They are so cold at night that they can't sleep, so they move two unburnt bricks to press on their bodies. The couple cries constantly in the middle of the night. They have nothing to eat at home, so they borrow grain from the local landlord, Wen. They begged him bitterly before he lent them a sheng of cattle feed. They also borrowed grain from the landlord Ye Chunhua. After saying a lot of nice things, Ye, with a scolding tone, insisted on a written document as collateral. Ma Guangqian is sixty-one years old, with a family of four and five mu of land. He came with his mother in the womb, and his father died when he was six years old. In the old society, people looked down on him. He had been starving and begging for food since he was thirty-five years old. His son is fifteen years old this year and hasn't eaten dumplings for twelve years during the New Year. Now, he is about to run out of food, and his clothes are so torn that they cannot be piled up. The family has three ragged quilts, which are hung up as a door during the day and taken down to cover themselves at night. He doesn't have his own house and lives in two dilapidated garden rooms belonging to others. In the year of the famine, because the child was crying from hunger, he held the child to beg for food in the winter of the previous year, and his hands were so frozen that he still can't hold anything. During the mass movement, the farmers' association only distributed some grain. The house that was sold to the landlord Ye Chunhua in the year of the famine was not allowed to be redeemed, and the land that was sold was not allowed to be returned. The landlord even cursed him by his childhood name, \"Do you know what your surname is!\" The landlord had money and power, and old Ma didn't dare to say anything. Wang Deming has a family of five with two quilts. His wife angrily said, \"The words of the poor are not even worth a dog's fart. If the village cadres don't lead the way, the poor can only stare blankly.\" Wang Shangwen, Mo Fushun, Ma Mingqi, and Wen Yunchen are all poor peasants who have not received any fruits and live in very difficult conditions. They dare not speak in the village.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 景县七里庄　贫农从没得果实如今仍借地主粮\n\n1948-01-11\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　景县七里庄\n  　贫农从没得果实如今仍借地主粮\n    【冀南消息】景县七区后七里庄过去土地改革不彻底，贫农仍是吃不饱、穿不暖，受地主欺负，过着痛苦日子。闻云荣六十二岁，从十七岁扛活到五十九，全家六口人，大闺女十五岁，小儿七岁，老的老，小的小，没做活的人，种着十八亩碱地，收成很少，年年春天带着孩子去要饭。群众运动中也没分得果实，今年收的只落个冬饱。冬天全家就两床破被子，大人疼孩子给孩子盖上，两口子原身躺在炕席上，晚上冻的睡不着就搬两个坯压在身上，半夜里两口子不断的哭。家里没吃的，给当家地主闻某借粮，苦苦哀求才借给一升牛料。又向地主叶春花借粮食，说了一顿好话，叶带着骂腔非要文书作抵押不行。马光前六十一岁，全家四口人五亩地，他娘胎身带他来的，六岁时他爹死了。在旧社会里人瞧不起，卅五岁上就挨饿要饭，他小子今年十五岁，十二年过年没吃过饺子。现在眼看就断顿，衣裳破的做不成堆。一家三床破被子，白天吊上当门，晚上摘下来再盖。自己没房子，住在人家的两间破园屋里。灾荒那年因为孩子饿的光哭，头年冬里抱着孩子去要饭，把手冻的现在还不会拿东西。群众运动中，农会里光分给点粮食，灾荒年卖给地主叶春花的宅子不叫赎，卖的地不叫抽。地主还提着小名骂：“你知道姓啥吧！”地主有钱有势，老马也不敢吭声。王德明五口人，两床被子，他老婆气的说：“穷人说话还不如狗放屁哩，村干不领着干，穷人干瞪眼。”王尚文、莫福顺、马明起、闻云臣都是贫农，都没分到一点果实，生活都很困难，在村里不敢说话。"

    "content": "[News from this newspaper] In Zuoquan, Tongtan's production has been known as a model in the whole county. Since the winter production season, after detailed accounting by county, district, and village cadres, it was found that the cadres only emphasized the model village, and the masses made false reports of \"cultivate three, surplus one,\" which led to a spontaneous flow of winter production. The village cadres thought: \"We are a model village! How could we calculate a deficit?\" At that time, several calculations were made, but the goal of \"cultivate three, surplus one\" was not achieved. The cadres complained that the masses' \"thinking was not straightened out,\" and they mobilized the masses again, saying, \"You haven't calculated enough? The government people don't help either. If the calculation can complete the surplus grain plan, you will have both fame and fortune.\" After the mobilization, the masses reflected, \"No matter how we calculate, we will reach the surplus, otherwise the 'ya' (referring to village cadres) will say we are backward!\" In this way, more than 20 households in Brigade One all achieved \"cultivate three, surplus one.\" The village cadres said happily, \"This year's leadership has made no small achievements in production.\" Comrade Cao Haizhu, a county-level work team member stationed in the village, went to the home of an old farmer, Jia Jisuo, for dinner. During casual conversation, he discovered that \"cultivate three, surplus one\" was not realistic, and the cadres were taking care of family calculations. For example, Jia Jisuo's family had 15.5 mu of land, and the actual grain harvest this year was 13.8 shi. When checking \"cultivate three, surplus one,\" they were afraid of not reaching the goal, so they overstated it by seven shi. Xu Zhongwei boasted that he had a surplus of three shi of grain, saying, \"I am a surplus household, so it doesn't matter if I do less work during the winter production season.\" He spent 6,000 yuan to hire laborers to transport grain, while he stayed idle at home. After the matter was discovered, the cadres first made ideological self-criticisms. The deputy township head said, \"I thought our village was a model village, and failure to complete the surplus grain would affect our work!\" At the meeting, Comrade Cao Haizhu said, \"If you can't do the accounting for the masses, you can't manage their affairs.\" Then, the whole town had a second round of family calculations. After calculating 13 households, they were short 74 shi of grain. The myth of \"cultivate three, surplus one\" was shattered among the cadres and the masses, and the deficit was exposed. The remedial measures are: to reorganize the mutual aid teams in the summer and autumn harvests, increase procurement, provide the masses with paid transportation work, have full laborers drive livestock, and have semi-laborers concentrate on accumulating fertilizer, etc., to find ways to make up for the deficit.

    "content": "Shuimen Village's Poor and Hired Laborers Fail to Overcome Poverty\n　　\"Cultivate Three, Retain One\" is a Rich Peasant Route\n　　[This newspaper's dispatch] In the past, Xingtai's Shuimen Village was a \"production model.\" Judging from the village's overall income and expenditure, it achieved \"cultivate three, retain one\" this year. A further examination of the actual income and expenditure of each class reveals a significant difference. The 43 old middle-peasant households had an average surplus of 8.5 *dou* of grain per person; among them, the 14 upper-middle peasant households had an average surplus of 1.28 *shi* of grain. The richest household had an average surplus of 1.5 *shi* of grain per person. The 58 poor and hired laborer households had an average surplus of 5.7 *dou* of grain per person, just reaching \"cultivate three, retain one\"; among them, 20 households had an average surplus of only 3.6 *dou* of grain, barely enough to be self-sufficient. The 14 landlord households had a total income of 115 *shi*, with an average surplus of 2.2 *dou* of grain per person, while the six households that had declined into the middle-peasant category had an average surplus of 9.8 *dou* of grain per person; the three rich peasant households had an average surplus of 1.49 *shi* of grain per person.\n　　Looking at the peasants: the old middle peasants had the most surplus, but when looking at the entire poor and hired laborer class, they only just achieved \"cultivate three, retain one,\" and 20 lower-middle peasant households were only self-sufficient. Looking at the landlords and rich peasants: their surplus was not much, but the ones who declined into the middle-peasant category and the rich peasants all exceeded \"cultivate three, retain one.\" When statistics were taken by household, 13 households of poor and hired laborers were only just self-sufficient, and five households were not self-sufficient; among the old middle peasants, 15 households were only just self-sufficient, and two households were not self-sufficient; among the landlords and rich peasants, two households reached \"cultivate one, retain one.\"\n　　The fundamental reason for the above phenomenon is that the unreasonable situation in the ownership and distribution of production means by each class still exists seriously. This shows that the land reform in the old liberated areas is still not thorough. The old middle peasants occupy more irrigated land, livestock, and agricultural tools; the poor and hired laborers, because they have not been thoroughly liberated, generally lack land and production capital. Some of the landlords and rich peasants, especially those who have changed their appearance or the rich peasants, have not been properly liquidated. They only offered some bad land and still own irrigated land and livestock exceeding the village average. From the comparison of the occupancy of irrigated land, output, and livestock in the whole village: the old middle peasants have an average of 0.7 *mu* of irrigated land per person, with an output of 2.46 *shi*, and each head of livestock cultivates an average of 5.5 *mu* of land; the poor and hired laborer class has an average of 0.46 *mu* of irrigated land, with an output of 2.23 *shi*, and each livestock cultivates an average of 9 *mu* of land; the landlords and rich peasants have an average of 0.64 *mu* of irrigated land (second only to the middle peasants), with an output of 1.65 *shi*, and each livestock cultivates an average of 10 *mu* of land; and the three rich peasant households have an average of 1.3 *mu* of irrigated land, with an output of 3.85 *shi*. Secondly, the village's class viewpoint is vague in production work, and not enough attention is paid to the interests of the poor and hired laborers. For example, in agricultural vegetable matters, the general average wage is suppressed, causing the poor and hired laborers to suffer. The exchange of labor for side occupations and agriculture in Group 5 is not equivalent. The cooperative only pays attention to helping middle peasants buy livestock and turns a blind eye to the lack of livestock of the vast number of poor and hired peasants, making the poor and hired laborer class have to exchange unequal labor with other classes in agricultural and sideline production.\n　　In addition, after the poor and hired laborer class have been newly liberated, the replenishment of various means of production and the necessary household construction cost a lot, which is not included in the calculation. If this consumption is included, the actual surplus of the poor and hired laborers will be even less. Therefore, there is a big question as to whether the entire poor and hired laborer class can really reach \"cultivate three, retain one.\" This calculation of \"cultivate three, retain one\" does not include clothing and daily necessities. The village's income mainly relies on fruit trees and sideline income, and grain income only accounts for 48% of the total income. And whether the surplus can all be turned into grain is still a question. From these materials, it can also be explained that achieving \"cultivate three, retain one\" is not the goal of the poor and hired peasants' struggle. More important is to solve their liberation problem.\n　　　　(Xingtai Work Group of the Taihang Administrative Office)\n　　This investigation material shows that land has not been thoroughly distributed equally, and advocating \"cultivate three, retain one\" is a rich peasant route. We hope that the comrades who conducted the investigation and the comrades who studied this material will continue to provide opinions on whether the class analysis method in the investigation is correct. --Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 水门贫雇没翻身　耕三余一是富农路线\n\n1948-01-11\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　水门贫雇没翻身\n  　耕三余一是富农路线\n    【本报消息】邢台水门村过去是“生产模范”，从全村总的收支上看，今年达到了“耕三余一”。进一步从各阶层的实际收支检查，相差很大。老中农共四十三户，每人平均余粮八斗五升；而其中上中农十四户，平均余粮一石二斗八。最富的一户，平均每人余粮一石五斗。贫雇阶层五十八户，每人平均余粮五斗七升，刚达到“耕三余一”；而其中二十户，只平均余粮三斗六升，仅能自给。地主十四户，总收入一百十五石，每人平均余粮二斗二升，而其中降中六户，平均每人余粮九斗八升；富农三户，平均每人余粮一石四斗九。\n    从农民中看：剩余最多的是老中农，但从整个贫雇阶层看：刚达到了“耕三余一”，但其中有二十户下中却仅足自给。再从地主富农方面看：所余不多，但其中之降中和富农却都超过了“耕三余一”。如以户为单位，分别统计：贫雇层尚有十三户仅够自给，五户自给不足；老中农中十五户仅足自给，二户自给不足；地主富农中尚有二户达到“耕一余一”。\n    造成以上现象的基本原因：首先是各阶层生产手段占有和分配上不合理的状况依然严重存在。说明老区土地改革仍不彻底。老中农占有较多的水地牲畜和农具；贫雇则由于没有翻透身，普遍缺乏土地及生产资本。地主富农中尚有个别化形的或富农没有受到应有的清算，只献了一部分坏地，仍拥有超过全村平均水准的水地和牲畜。从全村水地占有产量和牲畜占有比较上看：老中农每人平均水地七分，产量二石四斗六，牲畜每头平均耕地五亩五分；贫雇层则平均水地四分六，产量二石二斗三，牲口平均耕地九亩；地主富农平均水地六分四（仅次于中农），产量一石六斗五，牲畜平均耕地十亩；而其中三户富农则平均水地一亩三，产量三石八斗五升。其次由于该村在生产工作中阶级观点模糊，对贫雇利益注意不够。如在农菜上，一般的平均压低工资，致使贫雇吃了亏。五组副业和农业的变工上不等价。合作社只注意帮助中农买牲口，对广大贫雇农的牲口缺乏则熟视无睹，使贫雇阶层不得不在农副业生产中以劳力和其它阶层做不等价的交换。\n    加之贫雇阶层新翻身之后，各种生产资料的补充和必要的家务建设花费很大，并未计算在内，如将这笔消耗计算的话，贫雇的实际剩余就更少了。因之整个贫雇阶层是否真能达到耕三余一是个很大的疑问。这一耕三余一的计算，未包括穿衣日用在内，该村收入又主要依靠果木和副业收入，粮食收入只占总收入百分之四十八。而余款是否能够全部变成粮食，还是个问题。从这些材料中亦就可以说明达到耕三余一，还不是贫雇农的奋斗目标，更重要的是解决他们的翻身问题。\n             （太行行署邢台工作组）  　　　　　　　　　　\n    这一调查材料，说明土地未能彻底平分，提倡“耕三余一”就是富农路线，调查中的阶级分析方法是否正确，希望调查的同志与研究这一材料的同志继续提供意见。——编者"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Comprehensive report: The people's armed forces in Hunan and Hubei are growing daily, reaching over 25,000 people. According to a Shanghai dispatch on the 6th from the semi-official American news agency United Press, the activities of the people's armed forces have greatly increased in the vast area of 150 to 200 miles (450 to 600 li) along the border of Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Liu Xianghai's unit of over 2,000 men, part of the \"South China Democratic Allied Army,\" recently launched a major attack on Guidong County, which borders Jiangxi and Guangdong, forcing Wang Dongyuan, chairman of the Chiang bandit's Hunan Province, to seek help from Chiang Kai-shek, the bandit chieftain in Nanjing. According to news from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas: tens of thousands of the \"Poor People's Corps,\" who revolted in 1946 in Chenxian, Guiyang, and Yongxing counties in southern Hunan to resist grain requisitioning, usury, and high rents, are now operating separately in the Qitianling Mountains between Yizhang and Linwu counties on the Hunan-Guangdong border, and in the Dupangling and Longhukou Mountains in Jianghua, Daoxian, and Yongming areas on the Hunan-Guangxi border. The Qitianling mountain area has now become connected with the powerful people's armed base areas in counties such as Nanxiong in northern Guangdong, and the Dupangling mountain area has become part of the \"Guidong Liberated Area.\" Since the New Fourth Army under General Li Renlin entered Hunan last year, the people on both the east and west banks of Dongting Lake have risen up to organize anti-Chiang armed forces, which now number several thousand. They are active in Xiangyin, Pingjiang, and Liuyang in eastern Hunan, and in Anxiang, Lixian, Shimen, Cili, Dayong, Sangzhi, Yongshun, Baojing, Yuanling in western Hunan, and in Gong'an, Zhijiang, Changyang, Badong, Wufeng, Hefeng, Yi'en, and Laifeng counties in Hubei. A unit operating between Hengyang, Shaoyang, and Xiangxiang is well-organized and disciplined, and the Shanghai newspapers refer to it as the New Fourth Army. In Chaling County, the birthplace of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi, at the foot of Jinggang Mountain, and in Youxian and Rucheng, and in Mayang on the border of Hunan and Guizhou, there are anti-Chiang armed activities. According to the above statistics, the people's armed forces are active in 28 counties in Hunan and 8 counties in Hubei, with more than ten units of the people's armed forces. However, all ten commissioners of the Chiang bandits in Hunan admitted at the \"Provincial Security Conference\" last September that every administrative region was under the threat of the people's armed forces, so the strength of the people's armed forces in Hunan is far greater than the above statistics. According to a dispatch from the United Press in Nanjing on the 5th, the bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek has been shocked by the people's armed forces in Hunan Province and has recently established a \"Changsha Garrison Headquarters\" and a \"Hengyang Headquarters\" in a vain attempt to resist.\n\nXinhua News Agency, East China, 7th: Shanghai newspaper reports: In the second half of November last year, the people's armed forces in Jiangsu and Zhejiang continued to attack Chiang bandit towns and transportation lines. On the 17th, a unit of the people's armed forces in the suburbs of Shanghai attacked Panlong Town, 40 li west of Shanghai, rushed into the Chiang bandit town government office, threw multiple hand grenades, and safely withdrew after a fierce battle with the bandits for half an hour. The people's armed forces in Changhua and Yuqian on the border of Zhejiang and Anhui advanced to the suburbs of Changhua City on the 25th and launched a fierce attack on the bunkers outside the city, causing the Chiang bandits to respond in a panic and consume a large amount of ammunition. The Chiang bandit county chiefs of Changhua and Yuqian counties urgently telegraphed the Chiang bandit provincial government for assistance. On the evening of the 27th, a Chiang bandit express train traveling from Jinhua to Hangzhou on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was ambushed by more than 40 people's armed forces near Zhengjiawu in southwestern Zhuji, who fired intensely with machine guns. The train turned off its lights, accelerated, and rushed to Zhuji Station before daring to turn on the lights for inspection. Chen Qi, the quartermaster of the Chiang bandit security team, and five others were injured.\n\nAlso: On the 19th, the people's armed forces in Yingde, northern Guangdong, killed Shi Deguang, a Chiang bandit section member who was escorting conscripts, and liberated five conscripts.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Comprehensive news from Chiang-controlled newspapers and periodicals: By the end of last year, the people's armed forces in Yunnan had expanded to over 44,000, more than doubling in one year (less than 20,000 at the end of 1946), occupying vast villages in 35 counties. The quality of the people's armed forces is improving daily. The fact that some teams have raised the patriotic and democratic banner and united with the people is an important reason for their rapid development. The distribution of the people's armed forces is as follows: (1) In the area along the Kuangbi-Shi Railway in southern Yunnan, including Mengzi, Shiping, and Jianshui counties, there are 5,000 to 6,000 men under Xu Shihao, the \"First Column of the Democratic Allied Army in Southern Yunnan.\" This unit was only a small team of several hundred people in 1946, but has now expanded tenfold. Intellectuals from Yunnan Province have joined the unit one after another, organizing propaganda teams to call on peasants to oppose conscription and grain requisitioning. Long Yonghe's unit in Shiping has grown from several hundred people in 1946 to 6,000 to 7,000 people. The ethnic minority armed forces in the Puxiong area of Jianshui County have also grown from several hundred people in 1946 to over 2,000 people. In this area, including Jianjiu, Longwu, Yuanjiang, Xinping and other counties, there are also units under Bai Zhenggui, Bai Xiaoqi, He Guangrong, Xiong Shanzheng, etc., each with several hundred men and guns, actively operating. (2) In the Huxi, Qiubei, and Guangnan areas in the Panjiang River basin in southwestern Yunnan, the \"Democratic Allied Army\" designation has appeared among the people's armed forces. In this area, Luo Rihui's unit has grown to 2,000 to 3,000 people. Last winter, they repelled a Chiang bandit brigade's \"suppression\" campaign. Zhao Yonggui's unit of over 500 men in Mile and Kaiyuan routed a Chiang bandit battalion last autumn. Yang Tiyuan's unit in Luliang has grown to 6,000 to 7,000 men and inflicted heavy casualties on the \"suppression\" Chiang bandits a month ago.

There is also Lu Xiqi's unit of over 1,000 people, operating across the borders of Yunnan and Kang provinces, and the \"Democratic Allied Army\" designation has also appeared in this area. (5) In Qujing, Zhanyi, Luoping, Shizong, Pingyi, Xuanwei, and other counties in eastern Yunnan, as well as Xingyi, Panxian, Zhijin, Weining and other counties in Guizhou, there are units under Tao Yongzhong, Li Dexing, Wei Guangxing, Zhao Huanran, An Xixian, Wu Ziyun, and Manzu An Dubang, totaling 4,000 to 5,000 people, actively harassing the Chiang bandits, forcing the 6th Regiment of the Chiang Yunnan Air Force Special Service Brigade and the county governments of various counties to build bunkers for defense. In addition, the units under Gao Cairan and Gao Ruyun in Simao and Ninger on the southern slope of the Mengle Mountains in southern Yunnan have grown to several hundred people. The minbian armed forces in Wuding, Luoci, Anning in the Pudu River basin in northern Yunnan, and Deqin, which borders Kang province in northwestern Yunnan, are all growing.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 湖南湖北浙江云南各省　人民武装越来越大  湖南井岗山区还是人民的天下  云南发展到四万人占领卅五县的乡村  打碉堡、打火车、吓得蒋匪手忙脚乱\n\n1948-01-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　湖南湖北浙江云南各省\n  　人民武装越来越大\n    湖南井岗山区还是人民的天下\n    云南发展到四万人占领卅五县的乡村\n    打碉堡、打火车、吓得蒋匪手忙脚乱\n    【新华社陕北九日电】综合报导：两湖人民武装日益发展，已达二万五千人以上。据美国半官方通讯社合众社六日上海电讯透露：湘粤桂边境百五十哩至二百哩（即四百五十至六百华里）之辽阔地区内，人民武装活动已大为增强。该地区人民武装之一“华南民主联军”之刘湘海部两千余人，近大举进攻＠连赣境的桂东县城，迫使蒋匪湘省主席王东原向南京匪首蒋介石求救。另据蒋区报纸消息：一九四六年为反抗征粮、高利贷及高额地租而起义于湘南郴县、桂阳、永兴三县的“贫民团”数万人，分头活动于湘粤边宜章、临武间之骑田岭及湘桂边江华、道县、永明一带之都庞岭、龙虎关山地，现骑田岭山区已与粤北南雄等县之强大人民武装根据地连成一片，都庞岭山地则已成为“桂东解放区”的一部分。洞庭湖东西两岸人民，自新四军李人林将军所部去年一度入湘后，纷起组织抗蒋武装，现已达数千人。活跃于湘东之湘阴、平江、浏阳，湖西之安乡、澧县、石门、慈利、大庸、桑植、永顺、保靖、沅陵及湖北境内之公安、枝江、长阳、巴东、五峰、鹤峰、宜恩、来凤等县。在衡阳、邵阳、湘乡间的一部，组织严密，纪律良好，沪报谓为新四军。湘赣边境中国人民解放军的发祥地的茶陵县属的井岗山麓及攸县、汝城，湘黔边境的麻阳，均有抗蒋武装活动。统计上述出现于蒋区报纸之人民武装活动县份为湖南二十八县、湖北八县；人民武装部队共在十部以上。但蒋匪湖南十个专员去年九月在“全省治安会议”上，均供认各行政区无不遭受人民武装之威胁，则湖南人民武装之实力当远超于上项统计。又据五日合众社南京电泄露：匪首蒋介石已被湘省人民武装所震骇，近设立“长沙守备司令部”及“衡阳司令部”，妄图招架。\n    【新华社华东七日电】沪报讯：去年十一月下半月，江、浙人民武装继续袭击蒋匪城镇及交通线。十七日沪郊人民武装一部、攻入沪西四十里之蟠龙镇，冲进蒋匪镇公所，投掷手榴弹多枚，与匪激战半小时始安全撤退。浙、皖边境昌化、于潜人民武装于廿五日挺进昌化城郊，猛攻城外碉堡，使蒋匪仓惶应战，消耗大量弹药。昌化、于潜两县蒋匪县长均急电蒋匪省府求援。二十七日晚，浙赣铁路由金华驶杭州之蒋匪特快车一列，在诸暨西南郑家坞附近，遭遇人民武装四十余人伏击，以机枪密集扫射，该车熄灯开足马力急驶，至诸暨车站方敢开灯检视，蒋匪保安队军需陈其左等五人已受伤。\n    又：十九日粤北英德人民武装击毙押送壮丁之蒋匪科员石德光，并解放壮丁五名。\n    【新华社陕北七日电】综合蒋区报刊消息：云南人民武装截至去年底已扩大为四万四千以上，较之一年前已骤增一倍多（四六年底不足二万人），占领三十五县的广大乡村。人民武装之质量日趋提高。若干队伍已高举爱国民主旗帜，结合人民，是其获得迅速发展的重要原因。人民武装的分布，计：（一）滇南筐碧石铁路一带蒙目、石屏、建水等县有“民主联军滇南第一纵队”许世好部五、六千人。该部于一九四六年仅为数百人之小队，兹已扩大十倍。滇省知识分子纷纷参加该部，组织宣传队，号召农民反对征兵征粮。石屏龙永和部，由四六年之数百人发展到六七千人。建水县属普雄一带之少数民族武装，亦由四六年之数百人发展到二千余人。该地区包括简旧、龙武、元江、新平等县，尚有白正贵、白小七、贺光荣、熊山正等部各有人枪数百，积极活动。（二）滇西南盘江流域之沪西、邱北、广南一带之人民武装已出现“民主联军”番号。该地区有罗日辉部已发展到二、三千人。去年冬曾击退蒋匪一个旅的“进剿”。弥勒、开远一带之赵永贵部五百余，去秋曾击溃蒋匪一个营。陆良杨体元部则发展到六七千人，月前曾给“进剿”蒋匪以重大杀伤。（三）滇西北金少江两岸永胜、宾川、鹤庆、邓川等县之夷族武装万余人，除有步枪万余支外，尚有手枪千余支，且拥有美械装备。（四）滇东北之巧家、鲁甸、镇雄、威信等县有民变武装小老飞（按：该地江湖黑话称毛姓为“老飞”）王三所部千余人，并进展到贵州之毕节县。另有陆锡歧部千余人，纵横于滇康两省边境，该地区也亦出现“民主联军”番号。（五）滇东曲靖、沾益、罗平、师宗、平彝、宣威及黔境兴义、盘县、织金、威宁等县有陶永忠、李德兴、魏光兴、赵焕然、安希贤、吴子云及蛮族安都邦等部共四五千人，积极袭扰蒋匪，迫使蒋滇空军特务旅第六团与各县县政府筑碉防御。此外，滇南蒙乐山脉南麓思茅、宁洱之高彩然、高汝云等部已发展到数百人。滇北普渡河流域武定、罗次、安宁，与滇西北毗连康境之德钦等县民变武装均在壮大中。"

According to the review of land reform conducted by the village's poor peasants on the thirtieth night of last year (November 19th of the lunar calendar), everyone calculated who had surplus grain. The grain harvested by these forty-odd poor peasants and hired laborers is only enough to eat for the year; two households have almost nothing to eat right now! The poor peasant Kong Zhen said, \"My family of two only has four dou of buckwheat left!\" Some of the hired peasants in this village had attended meetings in the district, and upon returning to the village, they grumbled to everyone, \"Why haven't we completely turned ourselves around? When we encounter a bad year, we have nothing to eat.\" Everyone said, \"How can we thoroughly turn ourselves around if we don't hold power?\" Feng Fang said, \"We are present during the struggle, but when it comes to distributing the fruits, we don't get a share. What's the point? Twenty out of twenty-two reviewers are middle peasants. Whose line are they following?\" Kong @Fang said, \"My land is all sandy. When the land was distributed, I said to the reviewer, 'There is good land in the west of the village; can you give me some?' The reviewer said, 'You already have a lot of land; we'll give you more later!' They gave the good land in the west of the village to five middle peasant households. Later, they didn't even give me any poor land. They said that this land was connected to the land boundary of those households, and it was more appropriate to give it to the middle peasant households. Our land is poor, and the harvest is bad; how can we have enough to eat?\" Then everyone thought about how to fill the gaps. Shuanzhu said, \"I want to do business, but I don't have any capital. I want to engage in transportation, but my little donkey can't pull for long.\" Everyone wants to do something, but they lack capital. Later, someone asked where our capital would come from. Where did the fruits stored by the farmers' association go? Seeing the difficulties of the poor peasants and hired laborers, the village cadres had to fill the gap. They immediately registered the things used to reorganize village finances and calculated 800,000 yuan to temporarily solve the current production capital difficulties of the poor peasants and hired laborers.\n　　　　　(Niu Heide)\n　　　　　　　　　\n    Editor's Note: In Tian Village, sixty poor peasant and hired labor households, currently forty of which are lacking food and drink, urgently demand a thorough transformation.

This method does not conform to the spirit of the published Land Law Outline.

    "content": "Ci County Corrects Cooperative Direction\n　　Re-Investment and Voluntary Combination\n　　[Ci County News] In order to promote winter production, Chengguan First District convened an expanded meeting of cooperative cadres and main village cadres from the entire district to inspect the cooperatives. It was found that most cooperatives were funded by the masses' fruit money, not shares collected from the masses. Some cooperatives were established without consulting the masses at all, and some villages even established them by issuing notices and allocating funds. For example, Xingren Street was decided by cadres that each household would contribute 2,000 yuan to invest in the cooperative, which caused dissatisfaction among the masses, who compared our cooperative to the enemy's cooperative. In Xicheng Street: a towel factory was established with farmers' association funds during last year's struggle. One of the cadres was a bankrupt landlord, and the other was a normal school graduate (from a bankrupt rich peasant family). This summer, they sat in the shop every day, drinking tea, wearing foreign cloth clothes, flaunting their power like big capitalists. The masses were dissatisfied with the cooperative, but they did not express any opinions. After the masses investigated their class status, they were completely squeezed out. The cooperative's funds were distributed to the masses, re-investment and voluntary combination were carried out, and the hired poor Zhang Lianfang and Director Li were supported to take power themselves. The Puyang Street cooperative was found to have a purely profit-seeking viewpoint, resulting in losses and failing to meet the actual needs of the masses, thus becoming detached from the masses. After review, the funds were resolutely distributed to the masses, re-investment was carried out, the direction was corrected, and the focus was shifted to the poor and hired laborers. When the masses were pushing soil but had no brooms, the cooperative bought one. Siqian Street: the cooperative grasped the needs of the masses and organized a flower shop, organizing more than a hundred of the masses' carts to buy flowers and sell Jiazi flowers. From this autumn to now, according to incomplete statistics, it has earned more than 10 million yuan in foreign currency. The masses are very satisfied with the cooperative. At this meeting, most comrades understood that the cooperative is the village's leading production organization for the masses, resolutely facing the poor and hired laborers, overcoming the past purely profit-seeking viewpoint, listening to the opinions of the masses, buying whatever the masses need, selling finished products, buying raw materials, and cultivating the poor and hired laborers to take power.\n　　　　　　　　　　　(Rui Sheng, Bao Xin)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 磁县扭正合作社方向　重新投股自愿结合\n瑞生　宝鑫\n1948-01-11\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　磁县扭正合作社方向\n  　重新投股自愿结合\n    【磁县消息】城关一区为了推动冬季生产，召开全区村合作社干部及村主要干部扩大会，检查大部合作社都是群众的果实款，并不是群众集的股，有的合作社根本没有和群众商量，有个别村是下通知派款方式成立的。如兴仁街是经干部决定每户拿二千元投到合作社，因而群众不满，拿敌人的合作社来比咱们的合作社。西城街：在去年斗争中拿农会款成立了个毛巾工厂，干部有一个是破落地主，一个是师范毕业生（家庭是破落富农），今夏时每天坐在门市部，喝茶叶水，穿的是洋布衣，耀武扬威，象个大资本家样子，群众对合作社不满，但是也不提意见。经过群众查阶级，把他们完全挤出去了。将社里款分给群众，重新投股自愿结合，并且扶植起雇贫张莲芳和李社长自己当权。滏阳街检查出合作社，存在单纯营利观点，结果赔了钱，没有结合群众实际要求，脱离了群众，经过检讨，把款坚决分给群众，重新投股，扭转方向，面向贫雇，群众推土没有扫帚，合作社就去买了一部。司前街：合作社抓住了群众要求，组织了个花店，把群众的车子百余辆都组织起来，收买花子，推销叫子花，今年秋后到现在据不完全统计，赚洋一千余万元，群众对合作社非常满意。在这个会上，大部同志知道了合作社，是村的领导群众生产机关，坚决面向贫雇，克服过去的单纯营利观点，要听取群众意见，群众要啥咱买啥，推销成品，买原料，培养雇贫掌权。\n  　　　　　　　　　　　（瑞生、宝鑫）"

According to various sources, American imperialism has made demands to the Chiang bandits for various \"preferential rights\" to thoroughly destroy China, and the Chiang bandit Kai-shek has completely agreed. The United States has decided to greatly expand its military advisory group in China and greatly increase the powers of the group, including completely controlling the Chiang bandit army's training institutions and the entire command of the Chiang gang bandit army. To adapt to this plan, the United States has decided to send Major General Baer, the Deputy Chief of Staff in charge of personnel of the US Ground Forces Headquarters, to China to replace the current head of the US Military Advisory Group in China, Rooks, who has left China and returned to the United States. It is said that the US military advisory group will be increased to at least about 5,600 people. Moreover, the Nanjing radio broadcast on December 12 confirmed that in the \"Naval Agreement\" signed between the Chiang family bandit gang and the United States, the sovereignty of the naval base has been completely sold out to American imperialism. The broadcast stated that the agreement stipulates that Chiang and the United States will \"jointly defend the Pacific coast and help consolidate Pacific bases,\" which means allowing the US Navy to completely occupy the Chinese coast and placing the Chiang bandit's entire navy under direct American control. In addition, on December 12, Chiang bandit Foreign Minister Wang Shijie publicly stated at the Nanjing \"State Council\" meeting that he would follow the US policy in dealing with the issue of recognizing the new pro-fascist government. After American imperialism obtained the guarantee from the Chiang bandits to sell out China's national sovereignty, the US Congress passed a not-so-surprising $18 million on December 19 as so-called \"temporary assistance\" to Chiang Kai-shek. Moreover, the use of this meager amount will be supervised by the United States.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美帝国主义趁火打劫　廉价盗买我国主权  蒋介石卖国从天上卖到海底\n\n1948-01-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美帝国主义趁火打劫\n  　廉价盗买我国主权\n    蒋介石卖国从天上卖到海底\n    【新华社陕北八日电】最近美帝国主义和蒋匪屡次谈判中，利用蒋匪日益增加的困难危机，放手加紧趁火打劫。据各方消息披露：美帝国主义曾向蒋匪提出彻底灭亡中国的各种“特惠权”的要求，蒋匪介石已完全同意。美国已决定将其驻华军事顾问团大加扩充，并将该团职权大大提高，其中包括彻底掌握蒋匪陆军训练机构，并掌握蒋帮匪军的全部指挥权。为适应此项计划，美国已决定派遣现任美国地面部队总司令部综管人事之少将副参谋长巴尔来华，接替现任驻华美军事顾问团团长鲁克斯，鲁克斯已离华返美。据说美军顾问团将增至最少五千六百人左右。并且十二月十二日的南京电台广播，证实了蒋家匪帮与美国签订之“海军协定”中，已将海军基地主权全部断送给美帝国主义。该广播供称：协定已规定蒋美“共同保卫太平洋海岸和帮助巩固太平洋基地”，这就是说让美国海军完全占有中国海岸，并将蒋匪全部海军置于美国直接操纵下。此外，十二月十二日蒋匪外交部长王世杰在南京“国务会议”上公开声称：对待还罗法西斯新政权问题上将遵照美国的政策。美帝国主义在得到了蒋匪出卖中国各项国家主权的保证后，美国国会已于十二月十九日通过数目并不惊人的一千八百万美元，作为对蒋介石所谓“临时援助”。并且这区区数目，还要由美国监督其使用。"

The Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities' \"economic emergency measures\" have completely failed. Faced with soaring rice prices, Chiang Kai-shek's Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen was helpless and horrified, and hurriedly telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek's government's Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun for assistance. According to various sources, a large number of 5,000 yuan Customs Gold Units (equivalent to 100,000 yuan of Chiang Kai-shek currency) appeared on the market during the New Year holiday, which stimulated price increases.

There is only one way to raise the people's living standards, and that is through a socialist planned economy, not capitalist anarchy. Horner emphasized that the Daily Worker must oppose the reactionary attempt to divide the unity of British workers. Regarding Attlee's nonsense about the United States upholding individual freedom, Horner recalled what he had seen during his trip to the United States, where he witnessed thousands of people being deprived of their basic rights because they were black. Rust, the chief writer of the Daily Worker, said in his speech that one of the differences between the Communists and the right-wing leaders of the Labour Party is that we trust Britain, while they trust the US dollar.\n　　\n　　Gasan, representing the French Communist Party, paid tribute to the audience. He particularly emphasized that the task of communist newspapers is to faithfully report the facts, which is completely different from capitalist newspapers that distort the facts. Gasan mentioned the recent strikes in France, in which 3 million workers participated, while the international reactionary newspapers spread rumors, insisting that the strikes were organized by the Communist Party to create chaos. In reality, this is because French workers cannot endure their increasingly impoverished living conditions. Gasan stated that most French trade unions are still loyal to the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) and the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). Talking about the policies of US imperialism, Gasan said that the United States is attempting to forcibly exploit France and force Western countries to sever ties with the Soviet Union and the new democracies. The Communists reject this policy, and they resist the threat of war.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Comprehensive reports from various sources: The French working class continues to denounce the treacherous acts of the French Socialist Party's scabs in splitting the CGT. The executive committees of the trade union federations of Côtes-d'Armor in Brittany, Calvados in Normandy, Haute-Saône in eastern France, and Haute-Garonne in southern France, among others, reaffirmed their loyalty to the CGT at the beginning of the year and condemned the divisive activities of \"Workers' Force.\" After the scabs such as Stone House split off, the central bureau of the CGT reported on the current situation in the trade unions affiliated with the CGT in various places and stated with satisfaction that the French CGT has achieved good results in the aspect of the unions whose unity have been attacked.\n　　\n　　The treacherous activities of the French Socialist Party have also been criticized by the Hungarian trade unions. The Hungarian Trade Union, which has 1.5 million members, sent a telegram to the French CGT at the beginning of the year, expressing its indignation at the activities of the splitters within the trade union, denouncing them as betraying the working class. The telegram stated: Our combat experience teaches us that the tighter the unity of the working class, the more consolidated our political rights will be, and the better we will be able to defend peace and oppose the imperialist warmongers. The Hungarian Executive Committee asks you to resolutely safeguard the unity of the working people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 伦敦六万多人开会　庆祝工人日报十八周年\n\n1948-01-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　伦敦六万多人开会\n  　庆祝工人日报十八周年\n    【新华社陕北九日电】伦敦讯：此间六万余人于五日举行盛大集会，纪念英共“工人日报”出版十八周年。纪念会前两天（三日），英国首相艾德礼向美国帝国主义作代表功的反苏反共演说，适成为工人日报十八周年纪念会上若干演说者的抨击主题。全国矿工联盟总书记霍尔纳反击艾氏称：谈政治自由而无经济自由作基础，便是空话。提高人民生活水平只有一个办法，即用社会主义的计划经济，而不是资本主义的无政府状态。霍尔纳强调称：工人日报必须反对反动派分裂英国工人团结的企图。谈及艾德礼的胡说：所谓美国维护个人自由等等时，霍氏追述他旅美所见，他曾看到成千的人民因为是黑种人，而被夺去了基本权利。工人日报主笔鲁斯特演说称：共产党人与工党右派领袖之间分歧点之一，便是我们信任英国，而他们信任美元。\n    加善代表法共向听众致敬。他特别着重指出共产党报纸的任务，在于忠实报导事实，而与资本家歪曲事实的报纸全然不同。加善说到法国最近的罢工，曾有三百万工人参加，而国际反动报纸则造谣，硬说罢工是共产党组织来制造紊乱的。实际上这是因为法国工人不能忍受其日益贫困的生活条件。加善称：目前法国大多数工会仍忠实于总工会及世职。谈到美帝国主义的政策时，加善称：美国的企图是要强行剥削法国，并迫使西方各国对苏联及各新民主主义国家绝交，共产党人拒绝这种政策，他们抗拒着战争的威胁。\n    【新华社陕北六日电】综合各方讯：法国工人阶级继续斥责法国社会党工贼对总工会的分裂罪行。布列塔尼半岛的都诺尔省，诺曼第半岛的卡尔瓦多省，东部的索恩豪特省和南部的加隆豪特省等工会联合会执委会，于年初重申忠于总工会，并斥责“工人力量”的分裂活动。总工会中央局在石屋等工贼分裂出去之后，曾在各地总工会所属工会中报告目前形势，并满意地申明，在团结被分裂者所攻击的各工会方面，法国总工会已获得了良好的结果。\n    法国社会党的工贼活动，亦受到匈牙利工会的抨击。拥有会员一百五十万的匈工会，年初致电法国总工会，对工会内部分裂者的活动表示激愤，斥其为背叛工人阶级。电文称：我们的战斗经验教导我们：工人阶级团结的愈紧，我们的政治权利就愈巩固，我们就愈能更好地保卫和平，反对帝国主义战争贩子。匈牙利执委会要求你们坚决维护劳动人民的团结。"

The draft is to be formally implemented after approval by the Fatherland Front Committee Congress to be held at the beginning of the year. The draft stipulates that the Fatherland Front is a fighting alliance of all anti-fascist, democratic, and progressive forces in Bulgaria. It is a mass social and political pillar representing the people's democratic power, based on the alliance of the working class, working farmers, handicraft workers, and progressive intellectuals. It is a single people's social and political organization based on democratic principles. The tasks of the Fatherland Front are: to fight to eradicate the remnants of domestic fascists and reactionaries; to consolidate the spiritual and political unity of the people; to build the Bulgarian Republic and ensure the freedom, independence, and complete sovereignty of the country; to improve the people's living standards and cultural level; to completely liberate the working people from exploitation; to concentrate the people's strength to realize the program of the people's power; and to establish public supervision over the institutions of the people's power. The draft also stipulates that anyone who recognizes the charter and program of the Fatherland Front and participates in the work of any institution of the Fatherland Front, regardless of party affiliation, nationality, religion, or social status, may be a member of the Fatherland Front. Those who have directly or indirectly served the reactionaries or have been deprived of their civil rights are not allowed to participate in the Fatherland Front. Members of various parties participating in the Fatherland Front must be members of organizations at all levels of the Fatherland Front. Members of trade unions and other mass organizations are also members of the Fatherland Front.\n\nAfter the draft was published, the parties participating in the Fatherland Front held national congresses to discuss it separately. At the Zveno Alliance Congress at the beginning of the year, the chairman of the alliance, Georgiev, emphasized in his report: \"The interests of the Bulgarian people and the nation require the country to resolutely transition to a higher form of social and economic structure. No one should be surprised when we mention socialism. The socialist system is undoubtedly more perfect than the capitalist system, and the future belongs to it.\" The congress issued a declaration, resolutely obeying the Fatherland Front and fully endorsing the draft charter of the Fatherland Front and the declaration of the nine communist parties. At the end of the congress, Dimitrov attended the meeting amidst thunderous cheers and congratulated the congress on behalf of the Workers' Party, and delivered a speech: \"Despite the reactionaries' rumors that the Fatherland Front has become a purely social and political organization, the independence of the various parties has not been abolished and continues to exist, and the Fatherland Front is absorbing new members from the people influenced by the original parties.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 保加利亚公布　祖国阵线章程草案\n\n1948-01-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　保加利亚公布\n  　祖国阵线章程草案\n    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社索菲亚讯：确立保加利亚祖国阵线为单一政治组织的章程草案，最近在此间公布。草案要等待年初召开的祖国阵线委员会代表大会批准后，即将正式施行。草案规定：祖国阵线是保国一切反法西斯、民主与进步力量的战斗联盟，它是代表人民大众政权的，具有群众性的社会政治支柱，它以工人阶级、劳动农民、手工业工人与进步知识分子的联盟为基础。它是在民主原则基础之上的单一的人民社会政治团体。祖国阵线的任务在于：为根绝国内法西斯与反动派余孽而奋斗；巩固全国人民精神上与政治上的团结；建设保加利亚共和国，保证国家自由、独立与主权完整；提高人民生活与文化水平；把劳苦大众从剥削中完全解放出来；集中人民力量，实现人民政权的纲领；并确立对人民政权机构的公众监督。草案并规定凡承认祖国阵线的章程与纲领，并参加祖国阵线任何一机构工作得，不分党派、国籍、宗教或社会地位，均得为祖国阵线的成员，至于曾直接间接为反动派服务，或被褫夺公权者，则均不得参加祖国阵线。参加祖国阵线的各党派党员，必须是祖国阵线各级组织的成员，职工会及其他群众团体成员，同时亦均为祖国阵线的成员。\n    草案发表后，参加祖国阵线各党派分别召开全国代表大会讨论。在兹维诺联盟年初的大会上，该盟主席乔吉也夫作报告时强调指出：“保国人民与民族的利益，要求国家坚决地过渡到更高形式的社会与经济结构。当我们提起社会主义时，不应该有人吃惊。社会主义制度无疑比资本主义制度更为完美，未来是属于它的。”大会发表宣言，坚决服从祖国阵线，并完全赞同祖国阵线章程草案与九国共产党宣言。大会将终时，季米特洛夫于欢呼雷动中莅会，代表工人党向大会致贺，并发表演说：“尽管反动派造谣说祖国阵线已成为清一色的社会政治组织，但各党派的独立并没有被取消而仍继续存在，祖国阵线正从受原有各党派影响的人民中吸收新分子。”"

In the fifth district, loans of 8,568,300 yuan were transferred to 18 credit cooperatives from 25 administrative villages, 1,080,000 yuan were transferred to four cooperatives, and 1,040,800 yuan were not transferred. In the fourth district, loans of 11,018,000 yuan were transferred to 28 credit cooperatives from 39 administrative villages, 1,730,000 yuan were transferred to six cooperatives, and 1,240,000 yuan were not transferred. Inspections of the on-lending process revealed that, although most of the funds were transferred, they had not truly reached the hands of the poor peasants and farm laborers. For example, in Loudi Village in the fifth district, all 500,000 yuan in loans were used by cadres. In Shitan Yu Village in the fourth district, of the 316,500 yuan in loans, three new middle peasant households borrowed 61,000 yuan, and seven old middle peasant households borrowed 220,500 yuan. One household that had been struggled against borrowed 20,000 yuan, which was used for medicine and noodles. One bankrupt landlord household borrowed 10,000 yuan, which was used to buy public grain. In Qinggang Village in the fifth district, the chairman of the trade union, a well-to-do middle peasant, (?) borrowed 30,000 yuan, did not use it himself, but lent it to the masses, earning a profit of two mao per yuan per month.\n    When winter production began, the Credit Department of the Hukuan First District Federation of Cooperatives distributed 700,000 yuan in bank loans to support poor peasants and farm laborers' production, dividing it equally among the seven main villages and two natural villages in the sub-district, regardless of wealth, giving 100,000 yuan to each village.\n    Based on the above inspection, in the past, when issuing loans, we only considered repayment ability, emphasizing combining with private capital and the use of funds, so most poor peasants and farm laborers did not dare to borrow, causing loans to be generally lent to middle peasants, and some even took the landlord and rich peasant route. In the on-lending process, we should conduct in-depth investigations and transfer the loans to poor peasants and farm laborers so that they do not feel financially strained during this winter's production.

Over the past month or so, the various military regions of Northeast China, while continuously conducting inspections of leadership, have set off a great upsurge in military training led by cadres and carried out automatically by soldiers, braving the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius. The Hegang Military Region held an enlarged meeting of the Party Committee last month, and sharply criticized bureaucratic and warlord styles of work.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 9th: New York dispatch: Labor unrest in the United States continues to escalate. The strike by Local 16 of the Chicago Printing Union, affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, has persisted for six weeks. This strike, involving 1,600 workers, continues to force Chicago's six major newspapers to maintain publication via mimeograph. The strike by the Transport Workers Union, affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), also erupted simultaneously in New York, Washington, and San Francisco on the 2nd, involving more than 3,500 workers. This included workers from the four major telegraph and telephone companies, thereby \"cutting off two-thirds of America's commercial telecommunications with overseas\" (Associated Press). The reason for the strike was the employers' rejection of the union's demand for a 30% wage increase in the face of rising prices, and even their counter-proposal of increasing the work week by five hours without increasing wages, a barbaric demand. According to the union, the strike will continue thoroughly. Simultaneously, 1,500 workers from the Government Employees Cafeteria Union, affiliated with the CIO, began a strike on the 5th due to failure to achieve their demand for a wage increase. This action made it difficult for 80,000 government employees who eat in 42 cafeterias to get meals. According to a Washington dispatch, the US Department of Labor released its full-year strike statistics for 1947 in July: Last year, the United States lost 35 million workdays due to worker strikes, with 3,600 strikes occurring.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 9th: San Francisco dispatch: Harry Bridges, president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) affiliated with the CIO, wrote in the union's newspaper, \"The Dispatcher,\" on the 27th of last month that his union is considering refusing to load cargo to certain countries, launching a movement similar to the strike the union launched in 1938 and the refusal to ship scrap iron to Japan in 1939. Bridges also stated that the CIO Executive Board is considering the problem that, within the next month, overseas workers will increasingly demand that our dockworkers \"refuse to load arms and materials onto American or foreign ships, which will be used against workers in other countries, to undermine worker strikes, and to disintegrate the struggles of workers against reactionary employers, landlords, and governments.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 9th: According to TASS, New York dispatch: The movement among prominent American social figures against the reactionary policies of the United States in the Far East is growing.

This situation has aroused great indignation among the broad masses of French society. As the film industry workers' demonstration passed through the streets of Paris, Parisian students gathered on the sidewalks to pay tribute to the demonstrators. The demonstrators held protest slogans such as \"The French Film Industry Wants to Live!\" and \"Money is Being Spent on American Films, While We Have No Money to Eat!\" The newspaper *l'Humanité* published a statement by the famous actress Sullon, who participated in the demonstration, saying: \"American tycoons want to destroy our entire culture; they want to strangle our film industry.

    "content": "Cadres Engage in Empty Talk to Mobilize Poor and Hired Peasants; Winter Production is a Mess\n　　Editor:\n　　In Wu'an, the mobilization of hired and poor peasants for winter production work was greatly delayed due to the public grain campaign. On the 20th of this month (i.e., last month's 20th), the 7th District convened a joint meeting of hired and poor peasant cadres and masses to summarize the army recruitment and public grain campaign, and to arrange for the mobilization of hired and poor peasants for production, actually a month later than elsewhere. The reason for the delay was that the mobilization of hired and poor peasants for winter production was not well connected with the army recruitment and public grain campaign.\n　　My village, Wangucheng, is considered a relatively good village among the three base villages of Changting (actually a backward village, \"relatively good\" is a comparison, and some district cadres are complacent about this, claiming credit from higher levels, which is really inexplicable). This time, after the cadres and masses returned from the meeting, they held a farmers' association meeting on the 25th, conveying all the issues discussed at the meeting and first proposed several issues such as \"cleaning up the remaining problems of mutual aid teams,\" \"calculating family property,\" \"rectifying small cooperatives,\" and \"formulating winter production plans,\" asking the groups to discuss and report back in three days. As a result, the New Year entertainment was very lively, but the group discussions were very perfunctory. According to talks with several group leaders, they only said that the meeting was held, there were no remaining problems with mutual aid, they were thinking of picking up and cutting firewood for winter production, the family property was not specifically calculated, and the specific winter production plan was even less discussed. Upon further questioning, some said: Our group bought another batch of sheep; some said: Our group increased its shares by so much; or these days we are all cutting firewood, etc. They simply did not grasp the basic spirit of mobilizing hired and poor peasants. Not to mention establishing the backbone of poor and hired peasants, even general organized and led production is impossible. In this way, mobilizing hired and poor peasants for winter production will become empty talk.\n　　The main reason for this phenomenon is that here they repeatedly instructed at the meeting: \"Finding hired and poor peasants\" should be carried out secretly, not publicly, so as not to affect the emotions of the middle peasants (this is what the village cadres conveyed, whether it is true or not is unknown). Therefore, the slogans of establishing the backbone of hired and poor peasants, the leadership of hired and poor peasants, etc., dare not be mentioned at all, and everyone is playing dumb. In fact, among the cadres and masses who went to the meeting, some were middle peasants, and a few were bankrupt landlords, and their emotions had long been shaken. Before receiving this instruction, they were grumbling secretly, and after returning from the meeting, they did not convey it at the farmers' association, but they were already grumbling behind their backs. As a result, the emotions of the middle peasants are even worse, the hired and poor peasants do not know when they can be mobilized, and winter production is bound to fail even more.

Battalion leader Wang Erbao was from a rich peasant background (name hidden, original surname Liu). When he joined the army, he attempted to desert. The previous time in the ×× trench, soldier Zhang Luoxiang bravely shouted to the enemy, but Wang Erbao timidly went to Zhang Luoxiang and whispered, \"Don't shout, don't shout! What if the enemy hears us, finds our target, and fires artillery?\" During the battle to intercept reinforcements, the enemy fired two shots, and he was so scared that he buried his head in the dirt, stuck his butt up, and cowered, afraid to move. He was afraid of death, unable to command and control the team, and shamelessly said, \"I'd rather get hit in the ass than the head.\" In battle, he said strange things: \"Suffering this is not as good as going back on a stretcher!\" When soldiers criticized him, he even said, \"I've been backward like this for a long time, are you just finding out now?\" Qiu Qinglin was from a rich peasant background, had deserted before, and after being forced to return to the team, he said, \"I've been a soldier for seven or eight years and I'm still a soldier, I can't even be a squad leader.\" At that time, the class line was not clear, and without considering background and battlefield performance, only looking at qualifications, and due to a shortage of people, he was promoted to small artillery squad leader. His thinking was bad, he didn't know how to manage a team, the whole squad was not united, and problems often occurred. In the previous battle, he performed even worse; he fired fifty of eighty shells. He didn't measure the distance when firing, didn't look at the point of impact, and didn't organize the soldiers to fire, wasting the shells. At night, he abandoned three soldiers in front to act as guards, and cowardly ran to a small cave in the back to sleep all night. In the trench, when soldier Wang Shu'er was singing for fun, he wouldn't let him sing, and even insulted the soldier, undermining the soldier's morale.\n　　After the battle, at the battle appraisal meeting, the soldiers exposed Wang Erbao's and Qiu Qinglin's shameful acts of being afraid of death, and believed that they were not qualified to be battalion leaders. If they were battalion leaders, they would only lead the team astray.

Prague dispatch: Premier Gottwald of Czechoslovakia delivered a New Year's broadcast speech, extensively discussing the achievements of the national economy last year, stating that by the end of 1947, Czechoslovak industrial production had reached the pre-war level of 1937. Gottwald pointed out: Last year's severe drought (grain harvest only reached 63% of the planned target) was a serious test for the new democratic regime, but \"we have won trust\" because the new democratic regime and the generous assistance from the Soviet Union and new democratic countries guaranteed the supply to the people. After condemning the reactionary forces' sabotage activities using economic difficulties, Gottwald announced: \"1948 will be a happy year for our industry and consumers, and a bleak year for speculators and saboteurs. We must do everything possible to improve the people's living standards and implement the land reform that our farmers are eagerly awaiting. To solve these problems, we must unite all progressive forces, purge the reactionary elements from the republic, and consolidate our national front.\" Finally, Gottwald asserted: \"This year's election will represent the legitimate aspirations of the working people and bring complete failure to the reactionary forces. This year will be a year of further consolidation of our state-owned economy and democratic regime.\" Furthermore, according to the Czechoslovak Planning Commission, all major industries in Czechoslovakia have completed the 1947 plan. The value of the fourth quarter's output was 60 billion crowns (equivalent to 1.2 billion US dollars), compared to 51.1 billion crowns in the same period of the previous year. After the First World War, it took Czechoslovakia as long as ten years to reach the pre-war industrial level, while after the Second World War, it reached the pre-war level within two years, which is a great victory.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 捷克国民经济发展工业赶上战前水平  总理宣布今年实行土地改革\n\n1948-01-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　捷克国民经济发展工业赶上战前水平\n    总理宣布今年实行土地改革\n    【新华社陕北十日电】布拉格讯：捷总理哥特瓦尔德于新年发表广播演说，纵谈去年国民经济的成就称：到一九四七年年底，捷工业生产已达到战前一九三七年水平。哥氏指出：去年严重的旱灾（谷物收获只达原定计划的百分之六十三），是对新民主政权的一个严重考验，但“我们已赢得了信任”，因为新民主政权和苏联及新民主国家的慷慨援助，保证了对人民的供应。哥氏在痛斥反动势力利用经济困难所进行的破坏活动后，宣布：“一九四八年对于我国工业和消费者将是快乐的一年，而对于投机商人和破坏者则将是黯淡的一年。我们必须竭尽所能，努力改善人民生活水准，并实行我国农民热切期待着的土地改革。为了解决这些问题，我们必须团结一切进步力量，清洗共和国的反动分子，巩固我们的民族阵线。”最后，哥氏断言：“今年的选举将表示劳动人民的正当愿望，并带给反动势力以完全失败。今年一年将是我们的国有经济和民主政权获得进一步巩固的一年。”又据捷计划委员会公布：捷各主要工业已完成一九四七年计划。第四季的出产品价值六百亿克罗那（等于十二亿美元），前年的同一时期为五百十一亿克罗那。第一次世界大战后，捷克曾费时十年之久，才达到战前工业水平，而在第二次世界大战后，两年之内就达到战前水平，这是一个伟大的胜利。"

Yan bandit Liang Peihuang, the local commander-in-chief of Linfen, Pei Cong, director of the Linfen Office of the Shanxi Provincial Government, and some family members took a plane and fled back to Taiyuan.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-12",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has gained valuable experience through the mass line in cultivating models. Ren Jizhen, deputy platoon leader of the unit, from Yishui, Shandong, and of peasant origin, has consistently worked actively since joining the army, and has therefore been repeatedly selected as a \"model\" and meritorious worker. The unit even issued a circular to the entire column to learn from him. However, just as the column was launching the Ren Jizhen campaign, it was discovered that there were various slanders against Ren Jizhen in the company. Some soldiers also began to doubt Ren's exemplary actions, and the rumors became more and more numerous. After the leadership discovered this, they immediately investigated, conducting individual interviews and forums to clarify the facts. At the forums, soldiers who had been helped by Comrade Ren Jizhen refuted many of the strange rumors slandering Ren Jizhen based on the facts and promoted his hard-working style. The investigation revealed that this dissatisfaction was mainly due to: First, the leadership neglected to praise and encourage the general masses, thus creating an isolated model, detached from the masses, and causing internal disobedience and jealousy. For example, Sun Dejun, one of those who created this disturbance, originally learned from Ren Jizhen and admired him very much. However, after he and Ren Jizhen retrieved machine gun parts together, the leadership only praised Ren and did not praise Sun. Similarly, after the summer offensive, Ren Jizhen and the company clerk Zhang Xiangming participated in mass work together. The leadership only awarded Ren Jizhen the title of \"Peasant Meritorious Worker\" and recorded a special merit, while not mentioning Zhang at all. Later, although Zhang Xiangming's merit was supplemented, it had already aroused Zhang's dissatisfaction. Second, in the process of cultivating and creating models, there was a tendency to \"abandon the old for the new.\" For example, Feng Baoda of the company said: The instructor has talked to him a lot, so it is easy to become a model. But me! I haven’t been talked to even once. Third, the leadership did not appropriately point out the shortcomings of the model itself. For example, Ren Jizhen had two shortcomings before class education (now corrected): one was that if the person being helped did not change after two or three conversations, he would no longer talk to him. The second was that when he discovered violations of discipline, he was blunt and impatient in his methods of stopping them. In the past, when praising Ren Jizhen, only his advantages were praised, and his shortcomings were not pointed out, arousing the dissatisfaction of some of the masses. These show that to implement the mass line in cultivating models, one should not neglect to encourage and praise the general masses when praising models. On the one hand, focus on key points, organize the masses to learn from the model, and create a large number of reserve forces for models. On the other hand, one should not neglect to point out the shortcomings of the model and should actively educate the model through the masses and correct them. This will not only prevent the model from being prominent and isolated, but also can connect with the masses and improve the model.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 某部取得带兵经验走群众路线创造典型\n\n1948-01-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　某部取得带兵经验走群众路线创造典型\n    【新华社东北十日电】解放军某部经过群众路线培养典型取得宝贵经验。该部副排长任纪贞同志，山东沂水人，雇农出身，入伍后一贯积极工作，因此屡次被选为“模范”及功臣，该部并通令全纵队向他学习。但正当纵队展开任纪贞运动时，发现连队里对任纪贞有种种诽谤，有些战士对任的模范行动也发生怀疑，流言并越来越多，领导上发现后，立即调查，进行个别谈话和座谈会，以弄清事实，座谈会上受过任纪贞同志帮助的战士都根据事实将诽谤任纪贞的许多怪话，一一加以驳斥，并发扬他的艰苦作风。经调查结果，发生这种不满情绪主要是由于：第一领导上忽视了对一般群众的表扬与鼓励，因此造成典型孤立，脱离群众和引起内部的不服与妒忌。如制造这场风波之一的孙德俊，原来是向任纪贞学习，而且对他很佩服的，但他那次与任纪贞一起取回机枪零件后，领导上只表扬了任而没有表扬孙。又如夏季攻势后，任纪贞曾与该连文书张相明一起参加群运，领导上只赠任纪贞为“农民功臣”，记以特功，而对张却一字未提，后来虽替张相明补功，但已引起张的不满。第二、在培养与创造典型过程中，有“有新抛旧”的偏向，如该连冯保达说：指导员和他谈过很多话，当然容易成为模范，我呢！一次话也没谈过。第三、领导上对典型本身存在的缺点没有适当的加以指出，如任纪贞在阶级教育前，有两个缺点：（现在已经改正）一是对被帮助者如果经过两三次谈话没有转变，他就不再找他谈了。二是当他发现有违犯纪律现象时，在制止的方法上表现生硬急燥。过去表扬任纪贞时，只表扬优点，而不指出他的缺点，引起一部分群众的不服。这些说明要贯彻群众路线培养典型，在表扬典型时不应忽视对一般群众的鼓励与表扬，一方面抓住重点，组织群众向典型学习，创造出大批典型的后备军，另方面应不忽视指出典型的缺点，应积极通过群众，教育典型，加以纠正。这样既不致使典型突出孤立，而且能联系群众，提高典型。"

    "title": "\"Standpoint,\" \"Loopholes,\" \"Satisfaction\": Reflection on \"My Landlord Standpoint in Dealing with Family Issues\"",
    "author": "Su",
    "date": "1948-01-12",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "“Standpoint,\" \"Loopholes,\" \"Satisfaction\"\n    Reflections on \"My Landlord Standpoint in Dealing with Family Issues\"\n    Su\n    After reading the article \"My Landlord Standpoint in Dealing with Family Issues\" published in the People's Daily on January 7th, I was greatly enlightened by his frank exposure of his landlord ideology, as I am also of landlord origin. I would also like to raise a few more questions for joint study. The purpose is to make us resolutely and thoroughly separate from the landlord class ideologically.\n    First, the issue of \"two standpoints\": Comrade X reflected that after hearing the transmission of the May Fourth Directive, his \"first joy (that contradictions in work were resolved) was standing on the work standpoint,\" and his \"second joy (taking care of the family) was standing on the landlord standpoint.\" Comrade X’s handling of family issues is sufficient to prove that he was on the landlord standpoint, with no so-called work standpoint. He said that the policy of eliminating landlords \"resolved contradictions in work.\" Judging from his family issues, not only were the contradictions not resolved, but they increased a lot. From the phenomenon, these contradictions may have changed somewhat compared to before the May Fourth Directive, but the essence of the contradiction—the contradiction between landlord and peasant—has not changed, and Comrade X's landlord standpoint has also not changed. His landlord family has not been eliminated. The fact that this standpoint has not been completely changed can still be seen in his reflection this time. For example, when Comrade X reflected on the issue of family division, he said: \"It was not from the starting point of satisfying the peasants' land demands, but from the original class standpoint, delaying the division of the family, and preserving and shielding the landlord family.\" Doesn't this mean that if he hadn't delayed the division of the family, he would have been standing on the peasants' standpoint? Isn't this a joke?! In fact, it is precisely because you divided the family that you preserved and shielded the landlord! Instead of examining this point, you reflected on \"one becoming two\" after the division of the family (this is necessary, but it is far from enough if limited to this), isn't this exposing landlord thoughts from a landlord standpoint?\n    Second, the issue of \"three loopholes\": Comrade X reflected that his mistake in dealing with family issues was exploiting three loopholes. It seems that if there were no three loopholes, he could have stood on the side of the peasants. I don't think this statement is correct. It's not a loophole issue, it's a standpoint issue. It's because he has a firm landlord standpoint and is trying to cope with all changes with the same old tricks. For example, first, he exploited the loophole of the county committee being \"emotional.\" I think first of all, Comrade X treated comrades with landlord emotions. Therefore, the county committee comrades \"had a lot of trouble dealing with my (Comrade X's) family.\" Is it because you (referring to Comrade X, the same below) have the \"emotionalism\" of the proletariat that makes people \"have a lot of trouble\"? Second, exploiting the loophole of the masses' lack of awareness, this is saying that the masses are so foolish that they are willing to go hungry and freeze, and don't want land and houses! Is this a fact? Third, exploiting the loophole of the May Fourth Directive, the May Fourth Directive's \"taking care of\" starts from the interests of the peasants. Who are you planning for?\n    Third, the issue of \"five satisfactions\": What standpoint and what ideological emotions did Comrade X use to examine the \"five satisfactions\"? Why did he only reflect on his own satisfaction without reflecting on the serious harm to the Party and the masses? You were \"taken care of,\" but what about the poor and hired peasants? The status of the anti-Japanese war veteran landlord was improved, the wife's status was improved, but what about the hired and poor peasants? Your family joined the peasant association, what kind of people did the peasant association become? You did this with the qualifications of a Communist Party county committee member. Has the Communist Party's influence among the masses been tarnished because of you? Secondly, after you did this to your family, in leading the land reform in the county, especially in dealing with the issue of anti-Japanese war veteran landlords, did errors occur in the line? To what extent was the loss to the county's peasant movement serious? Third, due to your landlord standpoint, what was the political and ideological unity of the county committee like? According to you, it was \"emotional.\" If so, what is the harm to the interests of the Party and the people? The county committee resolution allowed you to not implement it for a \"long time.\" What mistakes were made in organizational principles? It is hoped that Comrade X will resolutely stand on the standpoint of the hired and poor peasants, go further, continue to reflect deeply, and expand the results of the battle.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　\n    We have successively published two articles on the reflection of landlord thoughts, and today we have published an article containing critical opinions from Comrade Su. In order for everyone to thoroughly eliminate the influence of landlords ideologically and completely separate from the landlords, we hope that comrades working in various positions will actively participate in this movement of self-criticism and criticism. Whether it is self-reflection or opinions raised on others' reflections, all are welcome.\n                            　　　　　　　　——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “立场”“空子”“满意”  对“我对待家庭问题的地主立场”反省意见\n\n1948-01-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“立场”“空子”“满意”\n    对“我对待家庭问题的地主立场”反省意见\n    苏\n    我看了一月七日人民日报登载的“我对待家庭问题的地主立潮一文后，由于他坦诚的揭发了自己的地主思想，对于地主出身的我启发不少。此外还有几个问题提出来共同研究。目的在于使我们从思想上与地主阶级坚决的彻底的分开家。\n    一、“两个立场”问题：某同志反省在听了五四指示传达以后，“第一高兴（使工作中矛盾得到解决）是站的工作立场”，“第二高兴（照顾家庭）是站的地主立场”。从某同志处理家庭问题上足可证明他是地主立场，没有什么所谓工作立场。他说：消灭地主的政策使“工作中矛盾得到解决”，从他的家庭问题上看，矛盾非但没有解决，反而增加很多。从现象上看，可能这些矛盾与五四指示前有些变化，而矛盾的本质——地主与农民的矛盾是没有改变的，某同志站的地主立场也是没有改变的，他的地主家庭并没有消灭。这个立场之没有完全改变，在他这次反省中还可以看出来的。如某同志反省分家问题时说：“不是从满足农民土地要求出发，而是站在原阶级立场上，拖延分家，保留和包庇了地主家庭”。意思是如果不拖延分家，就是站在农民立场上了。这岂不是笑话！？实际上正是由于你分了家，才保留了与包庇了地主呀！撇开这一点不加检讨，反而把分家后“以一当二”反省了一番（这是必要的，但只限于此就大大不够了），这岂非站在地主立场上揭发地主思想吗？\n    二、“三个空子”问题：某同志反省他对待家庭问题错误是钻了三个空子。似乎如果没有这三个空子他就可以站在农民方面了。我看这个提法就不对头，那不是空子问题，是立场问题，是因为他有坚定的地主立场，以不变应万变要出来的花样。譬如，第一，他钻了县委会“感情用事”的空子，我看首先是某同志抱着地主的感情来对待同志的，因此，县委会同志“对我（某同志）家庭处理颇费周折”，难道因为你（指某同志，下同）有无产阶级的“感情用事”，而使人“颇费周折”吗？第二，钻群众觉悟不高的空子，这是说群众愚蠢到甘心情愿挨饿受冻，不要土地和房屋！是事实吗？第三，钻五四指示的空子，五四指示“照顾”是从农民利益出发，你为谁打算？\n    三、“五大满意”问题：某同志用什么立场，什么思想情感来检讨，“五大满意”？为什么只反省了自己的满意而没有反省对于党、对于群众的严重危害呢？“照顾”了你，贫农雇农呢？抗属地主地位提高了，老婆地位提高了，雇农贫农呢？你家里入农会了，农会成了什么人的？你以共产党县委委员资格这样干，共产党在群众中的影响是否因你受到沾污？其次，你对你的家庭这样干了之后，在领导全县土地改革中，特别在处理抗属地主问题时，是否发生路线上的错误？对于全县农民运动的损失严重到什么程度？第三，由于你的地主立场，县委会在政治上思想上的团结如何？按你说是“感情用事”的，如此，对于党及人民利益的危害如何？县委会决议你可以“长时间”不执行，组织原则上犯了什么错误？希望某同志坚决的站在雇贫立场上，百尺竿头，更进一步，继续深入反省，扩大战果。    　　　　　　　　　　\n    我们已先后发表过两篇对于地主思想反省的文章，今天又发表了苏同志写来的批评意见的文章。为了大家从思想上彻底消灭地主影响，与地主彻底分家。我们希望在各个岗位上的工作同志踊跃参加这一个自我批评与批评的运动。无论是自己反省也好，无论是对别人反省提出的意见也好，均一律欢迎。\n                            　　　　　　　　——编者"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 8th. Comrade Jia Tuofu, Deputy Director of the Northwest Financial and Economic Office, conducted a self-criticism on the financial and economic work of the border region in the past two years at the Northwest Bureau cadre conference. He first criticized his mistake of emphasizing finance and neglecting the economy, and emphasizing commerce and neglecting production, in the implementation of the general policy of developing the economy, ensuring supply, and taking into account both public and private interests. He then separately reviewed the work in trade, finance, and other areas. He said: Trade work should originally serve public and private production, but before October of the previous year, the border region trade company neglected the exchange and adjustment of internally produced goods and the storage of materials, and only paid attention to absorbing large amounts of currency, gold, and silver. As a result, after October, it felt that there was a shortage of materials, and financial and commodity prices fluctuated. Because of the neglect of the internal market, a passive and indifferent attitude was adopted towards the business of cooperatives, and it was preferred to sell goods through private merchants. Moreover, the cooperatives were mostly controlled by wealthy peasants and speculative merchants, and followed a commercial speculation route. Production was divorced from the masses, and internal trade freedom became self-flowing, essentially allowing speculative profiteers to exploit and control the people's economic life. In foreign trade, the effort to tightly control exports of local products was also not successful, resulting in a reduction in the sales volume of salt, and losses in prices. In particular, the lifting of the ban on cigarettes and other luxury goods in March of the previous year resulted in the leakage of funds equivalent to 20,000 shi of millet from the border region within six months.\n\nFinance should also take developing the economy as its main task, but the currency issued in the previous year was used more for financial expenditures and less for economic development. The amount of loans issued was also less than in previous years. There was also a bias towards commerce and away from agriculture in loan targets, especially the erroneous policy of the bank attempting to invest in commerce and expand its capital base, which resulted in facilitating commercial speculation and smuggling. In addition, public-owned economic entities, in implementing the policy of centralized leadership and decentralized management, experienced serious departmentalism, failed to unite into a unified force, and even violated government laws and regulations. As a result, the rise in commodity prices and financial chaos in the border region in the previous year increased the burden on the people.\n\nIn past production movements, there was a lack of a class line. For example, in agriculture, the Wu Manyou direction was promoted, but there was no serious assistance to the vast number of hired and poor peasants in production, and most of the agricultural loans were not distributed to hired and poor peasants. Some areas did not distribute them at all. The assistance to hired and poor peasant family handicraft sideline production was neglected, while emphasis was placed on assisting the factories, workshops, or transportation businesses of wealthy peasants and even landlords. The wholesale business of the trade company actually helped the wealthy. In the labor model movement, very few hired and poor peasants were elected as heroes, proving that this movement had a weak connection with hired and poor peasants. In terms of burdens, there was also a bias towards heavy burdens on agriculture and light burdens on commerce, and heavy burdens on the poor and light burdens on the rich. Then, Comrade Tuofu analyzed the root causes of this bias, which were the impure composition of financial and economic cadres and the lack of a mentality of serving the vast number of poor workers and peasants. Financial and economic cadres, especially in state-owned stores, were infiltrated by many landlords, wealthy peasants, and old merchants, and even counter-revolutionaries. As a result, all kinds of non-proletarian ideas occurred and spread extensively during this period. Comrade Tuofu made a self-criticism, saying: \"Although I myself was not born into a landlord or wealthy peasant family, I also accepted the influence of their ideas, and blurred my class viewpoint in the long-term peaceful environment. At the same time, in terms of thinking methods, the test of practical work during this period also proved that I still had the problem of subjectivism and old experience, and committed conservative tendencies. This proves that although I have gone through long-term work, rectification, and the Seventh National Congress education, I have not learned well, and I am even more aware of how difficult it is to be a student of Chairman Mao.\" He then criticized his leadership style for having the shortcomings of bureaucracy and liberalism, failing to use cadres carefully and solve problems in a timely manner, which led to serious development. For example, errors such as a small number of personnel engaging in private gain at public expense, muddying the waters to fish for profits, embezzlement and corruption, and some cadres panicking and losing public grain and large quantities of materials during the early stages of the battle. Comrade Tuofu further criticized the relationship between the financial and economic departments and the Party, believing that there was a tendency to seek independence from the Party. He also made a self-criticism, saying: \"Sometimes, when the Party's opinions did not suit my own interests, I thought they were not feasible and resisted them. This attitude is actually a tendency to break away from the Party's leadership. The result is to harm the interests of the Party and the people.\" He stated that he was determined to serve the people wholeheartedly in the future, resolutely implement the Party's financial and economic policies, and overcome all difficulties to strive for victory in the war to liberate the Northwest.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 西北财办贾拓夫同志　检讨边区财经工作\n\n1948-01-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　西北财办贾拓夫同志\n  　检讨边区财经工作\n    【新华社西北八日电】西北财经办事处副主任贾拓夫同志在西北局干部大会上检讨近两年来边区财经工作。他首先检讨在执行发展经济保证供给及公私兼顾的总方针中，犯了偏重财政忽视经济和重商业轻生产的偏向。接着分别检讨贸易、金融等工作。他说：贸易工作原应为公私生产服务，但边区贸易公司在前年十月前忽视了内部市场生产品的交流调剂及储存物资，只注意大量吸收货币金银，于是十月后感到物资不足，金融物价波动。因对内部市场忽视，对合作社业务又采消极不理态度，宁肯经过私商销售货物；而合作社又多为富农及投机商人所把持，走了商业投机路线，生产脱离群众，内部贸易自由变成自流，实质上是让投机奸商去剥削和控制人民的经济生活。在对外贸易上。也未抓紧输出土产品，使食盐销售量减少，价格上也吃了亏。特别是前年三月对纸烟迷信品等的开禁，六个月内即使边区漏出资金折合达二万石小米。\n    金融亦应以发展经济为其主要任务，但前年发行的通货用于财政开支多，用于发展经济的少。发放贷款的数量，也比历年都少。贷款对象又有重商轻农偏向，特别是银行企图投资商业、壮大基金的错误方针，结果便利了商业投机和走私。加之公营经济在执行集中领导分散经营方针中，发生严重的本位主义，未能团结为统一力量，甚至违反政府法令，于是造成了前年边区物价的上涨和金融混乱，加重了人民负担。\n    在过去的生产运动中，缺乏阶级路线，如农业中提倡吴满有方向，但没有认真帮助广大雇贫农生产，农贷也大多未放到雇贫农手中，个别区根本未放下去。忽视扶助雇贫农家庭手工副业生产，而偏重扶助富农甚至地主的工厂作坊或运输业。贸易公司的批发，实际上也是帮助了富有者。在劳模运动中，雇贫农当选英雄者很少，证明这一运动与雇贫农联系很弱。在负担上，也有农重商轻，贫重富轻的偏向。接着，拓夫同志分析产生这种偏向的根源，是财经干部成份不纯，及缺乏为广大贫苦工农群众服务的思想。财经干部，特别是公营商店，混进不少地主富农及旧商人，甚至反革命分子。因而各种各样非无产阶级的思想，在这一时期就大量的发生与蔓延起来了。拓夫同志自我检讨说：“我自己虽非出身于地主富农阶级，但也接受了他们思想的影响，并在长期和平环境中模糊了自己的阶级观点。同时在思想方法上，这一期间实际工作的考验，也证明还有主观主义的毛病和守旧经验，犯了保守倾向。这证明我虽经过长期工作，整风和七大教育，但还没有学好，更觉悟到作毛主席的小学生何等不易。”他接着检讨自己领导作风上有官僚主义自由主义的毛病，未能慎重使用干部，及时解决问题，以致发展到严重程度。如少数人员假公济私、混水摸鱼、贪污腐化，及战斗初期某些干部惊惶失措，丢失公粮及大批物资等错误。拓夫同志进一步检讨财经部门与党的关系时，认为有对党闹独立的倾向。他并自我检讨说：“有时党的意见不适合我自己的兴趣，我就认为行不通而加以抵抗，这种态度其实际就是脱离党的领导的倾向。其结果便是损害党与人民的利益。”他表明今后决心全心全意为人民服务，坚决贯彻党对财经工作的方针政策，克服一切困难以争取解放西北战争的胜利。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th:\n\n　　A certain company, the Fourth Company, of the Liaodong Liberation Army used the \"comparison\" method in its rectification training to discuss how to overcome the difficulties of winter operations. This achieved significant results in establishing a hardworking ideological style and stimulating class emotions. The content of the comparisons included: (1) Comparing with the enemy: Many comrades said, \"The enemy is being beaten, we are proactive, and the enemy is suffering much more than us.\" Liberated soldier Liu Zhi'an said, \"When I was in the Kuomintang army last year at this time, I didn't even have a cotton coat. This year, I've already put one on. Even if it's a little hard fighting for myself today, it's nothing.\" (2) Comparing with last year: Last year, our equipment and supplies were more difficult to obtain. This year, it's much better. (3) Comparing with before joining the army: Han Chunshan said, \"During the puppet Manchukuo period, we had to do hard labor in the severe winter. The suffering was much greater. Now, in the people's army, it's much better than that. What's there to complain about?\" Many comrades said, \"Before, when working at home, we had to get up before the rooster crowed, and the suffering was entirely for the landlords. Today, enduring some hardship is for revenge, for all the poor brothers to turn over.\" (4) Comparing with meritorious personnel: Everyone said, \"They are people, and so are we. If they can perform meritorious service, can't we even persevere?\" (5) Comparing with old comrades from inside the Pass: Zhang Yitian said, \"The old comrades inside the Pass have gone through eight years of the War of Resistance, eaten bran, and suffered hardships, but they are still just as energetic.\" (6) Comparing with the Red Army in the past: Fu Changzhi said, \"The Red Army marched 25,000 li for the sake of resisting Japan, crossing snow-capped mountains and grasslands. How much suffering did they endure? Our little bit of suffering is nothing compared to that.\" (7) Comparing with older comrades: Everyone believes that the comrades in the kitchen, with such long beards, are still working actively. What are we young people afraid of? (8) Comparing with the civilian laborers: There is a North Manchurian stretcher brigade stationed nearby, all of whom came from Harbin. They are determined \"not to return until they reach Shenyang.\" Can't we even match the determination of the civilian laborers? (9) Comparing with the poor people who have not yet turned over: Wu Guoliang said, \"The poor people are wearing such tattered clothes. We have cotton clothes to wear. Can't we make it through?\" (10) Comparing with the superiors: Many liberated soldiers said, \"The officials on the Kuomintang side oppress and exploit the soldiers, eating well and dressing well. Our superiors here are just as hardworking as we are, and they are good examples for us.\" From these comparisons, everyone believes that all the difficulties of winter operations can be overcome. Everyone has a furnace in their heart, and that furnace is class consciousness. It can melt steel, just as Comrade Lin Xuecheng said, \"As long as the flame in our minds does not go out, we can overcome all difficulties.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 辽东树立艰苦作风克服冬季作战困难\n\n1948-01-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　辽东树立艰苦作风克服冬季作战困难\n    【新华社东北九日电】辽东解放军某部四连在整训中用“对比”方法，讨论如何克服冬季作战困难，对树立艰苦思想作风，激发阶级情感，获得显著成果。对比的内容有：（一）同敌人比：很多同志说：“敌人挨打，我们主动，敌人比我们苦得多。”解放战士刘知安说：“我在国民党队伍里去年这个时候还没有穿上棉衣，今年却早已穿上了，今天为自己打仗即使有些苦，也算不了什么。”（二）同去年比：去年我们装备补充比较困难，今年却好得多。（三）同入伍前比：韩春山说：“伪满时做苦工，严冬都得干，苦头大得多，现在在人民队伍里比那时强了不知道多少倍，还有什么苦。”有很多同志都说：“以前在家干活，鸡不叫就爬起来，而且受罪完全是为的地主，今天吃些苦是为了报仇，为了穷哥儿们大伙翻身。”（四）比功臣：大家都说：“人家是人，咱也是人，人家能立功，难道咱连坚持还不行吗？”（五）比关内老同志：张义田说：“关内老同志经过八年抗战，吃过糠受过苦，现在还是一样有劲。”（六）比过去红军：傅长治说：“红军为了抗日，行军两万五千里，过雪山草地吃了多少苦，咱这点苦哪里比得上。”（七）比年老的同志：大家认为，伙房的同志胡子那么长了还积极的干，咱们年纪轻怕啥。（八）比民工：附近驻有北满担架大队，都是从哈尔滨出来的，他们都决心“不到沈阳不回去”，难道咱还比不上民工的决心。（九）比还未翻身的穷人：吴国良说：“穷人穿的那样破，咱们有棉衣穿，还过不去吗”？（十）和上级比：很多解放战士说：“国民党那边当官的压迫当兵的，剥削当兵的，吃得好、穿得好，咱们这儿上级跟咱们一样艰苦，是咱们的好榜样。”从这些对比中，大家认为冬天作战的一切困难都可以克服。每个人都有一个火炉，这火炉就是阶级觉悟。它能熔化钢铁，正如林学成同志所说：“只要思想上的火焰不熄灭，就能克服一切困难。”"

    "content": "Gaoyi Cooperatives Fatten Landlords\n  　Eat, Drink, and Do Bad Things\n\n　　[Gaoyi News] Many cooperatives in Gaoyi were established with the fruits of struggle, but they are raising a group of landlords who eat and drink all day long and do no good, turning the cooperatives into \"retirement homes\" for landlords. The Houzhuangtou Cooperative was established with 100,000 yuan of the masses' gains. Landlord Xue Lao Huai was employed as a carpenter, provided with food and drink, and earned five dou of rice each month. The cooperatives made spinning wheels, looms, and waterwheel buckets, but were afraid that the poor peasants and hired laborers would not be able to pay their debts, so they did not sell them to them, but instead sold them on credit to middle peasants and above who had the means. The cooperatives' external debts could not be recovered, and internal consumption was high, leading to their collapse. The Nanqiu Village Cooperative (with 239,000 yuan in shares) had middle peasants as its chairman and accountant, and supported six landlords as cotton ginning workers. They were provided with food, and earned 1,000 yuan for ginning 100 jin of cotton. Nine people ate and drank every day, spending 165,000 yuan a month, plus 341,500 yuan for livestock feed and miscellaneous expenses over two months. The cooperative initially earned a gross profit of 410,000 yuan, but after deducting expenses, only earned 78,500 yuan. The chairman of the farmers' association reviewed and said: \"Our village cooperative has become a 'retirement home' for the objects of struggle, and we have been serving the landlords for nothing.\" The Gu Cheng Cooperative, funded by the hard-earned shares of the masses, never distributed any dividends. Last year, the disaster was severe, and the masses urgently demanded the establishment of a charity granary to store bran and vegetables and organize production, but the cooperative was controlled by a landlord (secretary) who adopted a supportive attitude and ate and drank all day long. After inspection by the masses, the employed poor were extremely angry and dissatisfied, saying that the landlords were not their own people, so how could they do things for them? The masses decided to replace the chairman and secretary with emancipated peasants and earnestly help the masses solve the difficulties of transportation, production, and charcoal burning, and the masses' production began to flourish.

    "title": "Serious Problems Discovered in a Survey of Five Villages in Licheng: Landlords and Rich Peasants Oppress Poor and Hired Peasants, Leading to the Collapse of Winter Production",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-12",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "According to reports from this newspaper: Licheng examined the reasons why winter production was not successful. According to a survey by the county office, in most cases it was because landlord and rich peasant cadres and landlord and rich peasant elements controlled the major power in the villages. In Jinjia Street, the one who held power was Yu Wenhusen, a feudal rich peasant who had been the village head for three generations, father and son, for more than ten years, and many of the main cadres were his loyal informants. Zhang Enkui and Zhang Junming, the main targets of struggle in the village, served as the chairman and accountant of the cooperative, respectively. Zhang Shenhai, a poor peasant and hired laborer, was the director of the Armed Forces Committee, but those landlord and rich peasant cadres insisted that he had \"special agent activities,\" suppressed him, and replaced him with the lackey Wang Songjiang. Sun Laohu, the political director of Xiwu, was a bankrupt landlord. These people opened their mouths to the higher authorities and said, \"The masses\" are like this and like that, and used the hat of \"special agent activities\" to suppress the peasants. They used these two methods to maintain their position.\n\n　　　　Using various methods to attack poor and hired peasants\nThey were most afraid of the poor and hired peasants rising up, and used various ruthless methods to attack them. When Jinjia Street carried out land reform, they said, \"The scope of struggle should not be too wide,\" and pushed the village head's two uncles from the first category of struggle targets to the third category. The poor and hired peasants were so angry that they said, \"If there are no targets of struggle, what are we fighting for?\" They tried to lead the land reform to counter-espionage, and used various bad methods to bite out many \"special agents\" among the peasants, and even beat some people to death. However, the real special agent, Wang Shuqin, was given a pass by them and let go. Zhang Jianü, Zhang Jiduan, Zhang Wentian, and Zhang Xiandan were the backbone of the poor peasant and hired laborer groups. They labeled these poor and hired peasants as \"special agents,\" beat Zhang Jianü three times, put her under control, and sent her to the flour mill to carry water; beat Zhang Wentian half to death; squeezed Zhang Xiandan out; isolated Zhang Jiduan; and ruined this poor peasant and hired laborer group. Subsequently, they organized a \"poor peasant group\" led by hooligans, each averaging eight mu of land. Ten peasant families in Kengxi were allocated a mule, which was taken away by the cooperative for no reason. When the mule owners went to carry the trough, they were labeled as \"special agents\" and beaten half to death.\n\n　　　　Cooperatives have become \"air-raid shelters\" for landlords and rich peasants\nMany cooperatives have become \"air-raid shelters\" for landlords and rich peasants. In the Jinjia Street cooperative, out of eleven people, there were three landlords, four feudal rich peasants, and four old middle peasants. The 100,000 yuan loan was put into the cooperative by them, earning dividends for their consumption. More than 1.9 million yuan was consumed in a year, and they also embezzled ten big shis of Yicang wheat into the cooperative. The masses reflected, \"After being struggled at home, they become ancestors in the cooperative!\" They suppressed the funds of millions of peasants, and the peasants had no capital for production. Dong Yizheng, a special agent landlord in Beishe, organized a small textile factory and asked the masses to pool shares to buy an iron machine, but it was used exclusively by five landlord women. The Xiwu cooperative also supported several landlords, who, in addition to earning wages, also asked the peasants to cultivate 15 to 17 mu of land for them. In Beishe, there were more than a dozen production security groups, and the heads of nine of the groups were landlords and rich peasants. Under the pretext of production, they controlled the peasants so that they could not move.\n\n　　　　Surrounding county and district cadres to conceal their crimes\nThese bad guys oppressed and bullied the peasants, and surrounded, deceived, and bought off the cadres from the county and district. In Xiwu, when dispatching meals and finding houses for the district cadres, they always chose places with many landlords and rich peasants. They lent wheat, oil, firewood, and water to the district cadres living in the village, settled their families, and sold fruits and fur coats to them at low prices. As soon as Comrade Li Lanting arrived at Jinjia Street to work, the village cadres provided a pile of \"special agent\" materials (actually materials on peasant activities). After Comrade Li Lanting himself reviewed, he moved from the political director's home to the director of the Armed Forces Committee's home to find poor and hired peasants. The political director moved the quilt over again, lit a big fire, laid white felt, and put up large and small tables and chairs in Comrade Li's residence. Later, four more cadres came to this village, and the meals at noon were all white flour, and there was even noodle soup at night. The next noon, it was all dumplings. Young women served the meals, poured water, and lit the fire. At night, the village cadres sent four or five quilts, as well as two boxes of children's cigarettes. Several cadres came in and out here alternately. If there was a meal and the district cadres were not seen, the village cadres would go to the whole village to find them. When asked about the situation of winter production, the village cadres said, \"Winter production has been organized and started!\" After the inspection, only thirteen or fourteen households in the village were working. Poor and hired peasants wanted to produce but had no funds. The village head sold four fruit carts, one for 7,500 yuan, all to middle peasants and above. They did not lend the money to the poor and hired peasants, but said to the district cadres, \"The funding for the poor and hired peasants has been resolved!\" Xiwu's base point convened a poor peasant meeting through the village cadres. Some lackeys and informants from various villages came to monitor the poor and hired peasants. This meeting did not get any substantive materials.\nThe poor and hired peasants are very dissatisfied with these things. Yuan Zhong'an, a poor and hired peasant in Xiwu, led the masses to block the accounts of embezzled fruits and demanded an immediate solution. The district cadres were afraid of hurting the \"emotions\" of the village cadres, and used the method of shielding and delaying. Comrade Li Lanting only found poor and hired peasants to investigate materials, but did not solve the problem, which angered the poor and hired peasants, who said, \"If it is not resolved, we will hand over the accounts to the county and quit!\" The poor and hired peasants demanded to seize the cooperatives controlled by the landlords and rich peasants and use them to organize their own production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 黎城五村调查发现大毛病　地主富农压迫贫雇弄得冬季生产塌台\n\n1948-01-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　黎城五村调查发现大毛病\n  　地主富农压迫贫雇弄得冬季生产塌台\n    【本报消息】黎城检查冬季生产没有搞好的原因，据县办公室调查，大都是因为地主富农干部和地主富农分子掌握了村里大权。靳家街顶专权的是十几年来父子三代当村长的封建富农宇文虎森，不少主要干部又是他的忠实耳目。村里主要斗争对象张恩奎、张俊明担任着合作社的社长和会计。贫雇农张申海是武委会主任，那些地主富农干部硬说他有“特务活动”，把他打击下去，换上狗腿王松江。西仵政治主任孙老虎是个破产地主。这些人对上边张口就说：“群众”如何如何，对农民拿“特务活动”的帽子压制。用这两套手腕，维持他们的地位。\n    　　　　用各种方法打击贫雇农\n    他们顶害怕贫雇农起来，用种种凶狠的方法打击贫雇农。靳家街进行土地改革时，他们说：“斗争面不能宽”，把村长的两个叔叔从头类斗争对象推到三类上。气得贫雇农说：“这倒没有斗争对象啦，还斗个蛋？”他们想法把土地改革引到反特务上，用各种坏法子，在农民中咬出好多“特务”，还打死了一些人。真正的特务王书芹倒叫他们开路条放走了。张嘉女、张记端、张文田、张县旦是贫雇小组的骨干，他们给这些贫雇农带了个“特务”帽，把张嘉女打了三顿，管理起来，送到粉坊里担水；把张文田打了个半死；把张县旦挤出去；把张记端孤立起来；把这个贫雇小组弄垮了。随后他们就组织了一个由流氓当头子、每人平均到八亩地的“贫雇组”。坑西十一家农民分到一头骡子，无缘无故被合作社拉走了。骡户去抬槽，他们扣上个“特务”帽，把骡户打了个半死。\n    　　　　合作社成了地主富农的“防空洞”\n    好多合作社成了地主富农的“防空洞”。靳家街合作社中十一个人，有三个地主、四个封建富农、四个旧中农。十万元贷款都被他们放到合作社中，赚上红利给他们消耗，一年消耗了一百九十多万元，还贪污了十大石义仓麦到合作社中。群众反映：“斗了家里，人家到了合作社成了老祖宗啦！”他们压着几百万农民的资金，农民想生产没有本钱。北社特务地主董义正组织了一个小型纺织厂，叫群众集股买了一架铁机，却让五个地主妇女专用起来。西仵合作社也养活了几个地主，这些家伙除了赚工钱，还叫农民给他们代耕十五亩到十七亩地。北社有十几个生产治安组，有九个组的组长是地主富农，他们借口生产，把农民管得不能动。\n    　　　　包围县区干部，掩蔽自己的罪恶\n    这些坏家伙压迫、欺侮农民，对县上、区上来的干部是包围、欺骗和收买。西仵给区干部派饭找房子，总是在地主富农多的地方。他们给住村的区干部借麦子、借油、弄柴、弄水、安置家属、贱卖给果实皮袄。李兰廷同志才到靳家街工作，村干部就供给了一堆“特务”材料（实际是农民活动材料）。李兰廷同志自己经过检讨，从政治主任家搬到武委会主任家去找贫雇，政治主任又搬上被子找了来，在李同志住的地方生上大火、铺上白毡、摆上大小桌椅。后来又有四个干部来到这村，晌午派饭都是白面，黑夜还作了面汤，第二天晌午全是饺子，端饭、倒水、点火全由青年妇女伺候。黑夜村干部给送来四、五条被子，还有两盒小孩烟。几个干部在这里交替进出，要有一顿饭的时候看不见区干部，村干部就到全村去找。问到冬季生产的情形，村干部说：“冬季生产都组织起来干开啦！”以后检查，村里只有十三、四户在动，贫雇农想生产没有资金，村长卖了四辆果实大车，一辆七千五百元，都卖给中农以上成份。钱也不借给贫雇农，却对区干部说：“贫雇资金解决啦！”西仵基点通过村干部召开了一个贫雇会，各村都来了一些狗腿、耳目监视贫雇农，这个会没有得到什么实在的材料。\n    贫雇农对这些事情是很不满意的。西仵贫雇原忠安领导群众卡住贪污果实帐，要求立时解决。区干部怕打击了村干部的“情绪”，用了包庇拖延的办法。李兰廷同志光找贫雇调查材料，不解决问题，气的贫雇说：“再不解决我们把帐交到县上不干啦！”贫雇农要求夺取被地主富农掌握的合作社，拿来组织自己的生产。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Reports from various sources indicate that the Shanghai New Year price surge, triggered by the Chiang government's issuance of 10,000-yuan banknotes, has further eroded public trust in Chiang Kai-shek's currency. Citizens are frantically buying gold and tangible goods, causing prices to skyrocket out of control. On the 8th, gold reached 12.4 million yuan per tael, 24 times the official price of 40 US dollars per tael (equivalent to 480,000 yuan at the official exchange rate). The black market exchange rate for US dollars has soared to a new high of 220,000 yuan, an increase of more than 30% compared to the 5th. The continuous breaking of new records in cotton fabric prices and the intense buying spree have forced the Chiang Kai-shek authorities to order a halt to trading. In addition, Chinese and foreign stocks also rose by 20% to 30%, with eight Chinese company stocks reaching their highest prices in the market within a single day. This price surge began in mid-November before the New Year, and it rose again after the Chiang government announced the issuance of large banknotes on December 10th. The recent appearance of these large banknotes during the New Year period has sparked a third wave of frantic price increases. Over the past month, the Chiang government has arrested merchants in large numbers and implemented financial controls such as suspending loans and remittances, but all have been ineffective. Since the start of the price surge, the black market exchange rate for US dollars has increased by one and a half times, and the price of rice has increased by more than 66%. According to Reuters, Chiang Kai-shek's Minister of Finance, Yu Hung-chun, has resigned due to his inability to overcome the continued deterioration of Chiang Kai-shek's economic situation.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek, prices in Qingdao are soaring, and there is a severe food shortage. In late December, the price of rice reached 1.2 million yuan (Chiang Kai-shek currency) per dan (unit of weight), millet 1 million yuan per dan, and even the pancakes eaten by coolies cost 10,200 yuan per jin (unit of weight). The people's lives are becoming increasingly difficult. A rickshaw puller's daily earnings of 18,000 yuan are not enough to buy two jin of pancakes, let alone support a family. Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the 4th Security Column stationed in Qingdao are also not getting enough to eat, receiving only one and a half jin of dark, coarse flour per day. They have written phrases such as \"Can't get enough to eat, running home,\" and \"Hungry, join the Eighth Route Army\" all over the walls of the latrines. In order to collect grain to supply the Chiang Kai-shek troops, the Chiang Kai-shek authorities are openly seizing grain from the people, ordering all merchants and residents in the city to surrender all but three bags of flour and 100 jin of millet per person. Factories in Qingdao are closing down one after another due to insufficient raw materials and high prices. For example, the Da Zhong Tobacco Factory, the Dongzhen North China Tobacco Company, and the North China Alcohol Factory have all closed, resulting in the unemployment of thousands of workers.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: As the Lunar New Year approaches, prices in Yantai City, occupied by Chiang Kai-shek, are soaring. The market price of gold has exceeded 12 million yuan (Chiang Kai-shek currency) per tael, an increase of two times compared to when Chiang Kai-shek invaded Yantai in early October, and 24 times higher than the official price of 480,000 yuan per tael. Daily necessities have also risen sharply. \"Battleship\" and \"Sycee\" brand flour has risen to 3 million yuan per bag. Fine cotton cloth has risen to 14 million yuan per bolt. The Chiang Kai-shek authorities are unable to stop the soaring prices but are instead cruelly exploiting the citizens. In addition to the existing more than ten kinds of exorbitant taxes such as \"gun tax\" and \"banquet tax,\" they have added a \"well water tax\" of 1,000 yuan per person per month and a \"toilet tax\" of 400 yuan. They are also forcing people to buy \"national salvation bonds.\" The Xiu Zhong Clock Shop on Nandadao was forced to close after being forced to pay more than 2 million yuan. Primary schools are also targets of Chiang Kai-shek's extortion. Fuleli Primary School was extorted 1 million yuan, Nanshan Road Primary School was extorted 700,000 yuan, and other primary schools such as \"Pengcheng\" and \"Zhenhua\" were also extorted tens of thousands of yuan. Under these high prices and heavy taxes, people's lives have been greatly threatened. Recently, sanitation workers throughout the city went on strike to demand higher wages. Currently, there are more than 600,000 jin of accumulated feces in the city, and the stench is everywhere. The citizens are constantly cursing Chiang Kai-shek.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 上海青岛物价猛涨　老百姓说：“肚子饿，投八路”\n\n1948-01-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　上海青岛物价猛涨\n  　老百姓说：“肚子饿，投八路”\n    【新华社陕北十一日电】据各方报导：由于蒋政府新年发行十万大钞所引起的上海新年涨风，广大市民更不信任蒋匪货币，纷纷抢购黄金实物，致物价有如脱僵之马。八日黄金每两已达一千二百四十万元，为官价每两四十元美金（按官价汇率折蒋币四十八万元）的二十四倍。美钞黑市汇价已猛涨至二十二万元之新高峰，较五日上涨百分之三十以上。棉织物价格的不断突破新纪录与炽烈的抢购浪潮，已迫使蒋匪当局下令停止交易。此外中外股票也上涨百分之二十至三十，中国公司八种股票市场于一日之内均达到最高价格。此次涨风开始于年前十一月中旬，至十二月十日蒋政府宣布发行大钞后会再度上涨，而最近新年期中由于大钞之出现市场，又掀起第三度的狂涨。在这一个多月中，蒋政府曾大批逮捕商人，实行停止放款及汇兑等项金融管制措施，但均归无效。自涨风开始至现在，美钞黑市汇价上涨一倍半，大米价格上涨百分之六十六以上。据路透社透露，蒋匪财政部长俞鸿钧已因无法克服蒋匪经济情况之继续恶化，提出辞职。\n    【新华社陕北十日电】蒋匪统治下的青岛，物价狂涨，粮荒严重。十二月下旬大米每担价格已涨达一百二十万元（蒋币）小米每担一百万元，苦力所吃的煎饼，每斤也要一万零二百元。人民生活日趋艰难，人力车夫一天流汗所得一万八千元，买不到二斤煎饼，更谈不上养家。蒋匪驻青岛保安第四纵队士兵亦吃不饱饭，每天仅发一斤半黑粗面。他们在厕所墙上写满了：“吃不饱，向家跑”，“肚了饿，投八路”等字句。蒋匪当局为搜集粮食供给蒋匪军，竟向民间公开抢粮，下令全市商民住户，除每人可留三袋面粉及一百斤小米外，其余全部没收。青市工厂在原料不足物价高涨下纷纷停工，如大中烟厂、东镇华北烟草公司、华北酒精厂等均先后关门，数千工人因而失业。\n    【新华社陕北六日电】旧历年关将至，蒋匪侵占下的烟台市物价猛涨。黄金每两市价已突破一千二百万元（蒋币），较十月初蒋匪侵入烟市时增涨两倍，较官价每两四十八万元已高出二十四倍。日用必需品也随之猛涨不已。兵船牌及元宝牌面粉每袋已涨至三百万元。花细布每匹涨至一千四百万元。蒋匪当局无力制止物价狂涨，却更残酷压榨市民。现除已有之“枪支”“筵席”等十几种苛捐外，又增添“井水捐”每人每月一千元，“厕所捐”四百元。并强迫购买“救国公债”，南大道修钟店即被强征二百多万而被迫停业。小学校也是蒋匪勒索对象，福乐里小学被勒索百万元，南山路小学被勒索七十万元，其他“彭城”、“振华”等小学亦均被勒索数十万元不等。在此高物价与横征暴敛下，人民生活已遭受极大威胁。日前全市卫生工人为要求增加工资全体罢工，现市内粪便堆积约有六十万斤以上，到处臭气冲天，市民皆咒骂蒋匪不绝。"

    "content": "The cultural work in East China has greatly contributed to the patriotic self-defense war and the peasant liberation movement over the past year.\n\n　　Xinhua branch offices are set up in all front-line columns, and hundreds of people's reporters go deep into the companies. In peacetime, they share weal and woe with the soldiers, and in wartime, they enter the trenches and even fight side by side. Model reporters such as Song Dake and Qian Yi (the eldest son of writer A Ying) and ten others bravely sacrificed their lives, and Wang Chuanguan and four others were gloriously wounded. The army newspapers insisted on publishing during frequent battles. The lead printing factory of the East China Frontline Newspaper of the Political Department of the East China People's Liberation Army has been traveling with the army on trucks for a long time. Each column and regiment has mimeographed newspapers, which have become a powerful weapon to boost morale. Countless literary and art workers, including cultural troupes, drama troupes, film teams, and primary school teachers, go to the front line to serve the soldiers. They cooperate with the propaganda and education workers of the troops to carry out recreational activities in the companies in peacetime, and help dig fortifications and rescue the wounded in wartime. In Jiaodong alone, more than 70 literary and art workers went to the front line to perform films such as \"A White Sailboat.\" The film team of the Political Department of the East China Field Army has been active with the army for a long time, performing Soviet famous films such as \"The Battle of Berlin\" and its own films such as \"Huaibei Light Cavalry.\" The popular editions of Soviet masterpieces \"Fear and Courage,\" \"Days and Nights,\" \"Soldier and Commander,\" and \"Our Sixth Company\" reprinted by the Xinhua Bookstore following the army are purchased by the majority of commanders and fighters, and have become the best reading material for educating the troops. The Jiaodong Xinhua Bookstore held book and periodical consolation activities from August to November, purchasing and donating more than 40,000 copies of books and periodicals and more than 2.24 million yuan in cash to the front line. The Binhai Xinhua Bookstore organized a battlefield cultural service team to promote sales on tour.\n\n　　In the rear, Xinhua branch offices are all over the military regions and military sub-districts. The Huazhong Xinhua Branch alone has seven branch offices, more than 600 cadres, and more than 25,000 correspondents. The most articles received daily reach more than 3,000. The Yancheng Public Daily has cultivated worker-peasant reporters, which has made significant achievements in reporting. The newspapers include the East China Public Daily, the Jiaodong Public Daily, the Bohai Daily, the Luzhong Public, the Lunan Times, the Binhai Rural, the Huaihai Daily, the Huanghai Daily, the Subei Daily, the Jianghai Daily, the Dawn Daily, and 34 types of newspapers, popularized public newspapers, and books from various sub-districts and troops. In Bohai, there is also the Islamic Newspaper serving the Hui people. The Yantai Daily and Xinwei Daily, which were temporarily transferred from Yantai and Weihaiwei, still insist on publishing during the war, and all publish news of people's armed activities with the largest coverage. In the Huazhong area, in order to adapt to the development of the new situation, the famous Xinhua Daily Huazhong Edition has been re-published on New Year's Day this year.\n\n　　Xinhua Bookstore branches and distributors are all over the counties and cities and larger market towns. Over the past year, the Shandong Xinhua Bookstore Headquarters has compiled and printed more than 300 kinds of books, including three types of small production series and public libraries that are popular among workers and peasants. A bimonthly \"Cultural Liberation\" was specially published for liberated peasants and their teachers. The Jiaodong Xinhua Bookstore published a total of 1.8 million books and textbooks. Other large-scale magazines that insisted on and were born in the war include Shandong Culture, Xinhua Digest, Jiaodong Literature and Art, Jianghai Magazine, etc. Among them, Jiaodong Literature and Art alone sells more than 10,000 copies per issue. The Jiaodong Xinhua Bookstore published \"New Party Member Reader\" and sold 130,000 copies.\n\n　　In the war and the tense support for the front and production review, formal primary schools in every village in Jiaodong still opened as usual, with 600,000 children enrolled. Part-time work and part-time study organizations are popular in various places, with early classes, afternoon classes, and evening classes, using the little teacher system to educate poor and out-of-school children. Many primary school teachers participated in stretcher transport teams for recreational activities, and many poured into the guerrillas and fought side by side with the militia. In the three counties of Ju County, Zhuting, and Tancheng, more than 200 teachers participated in the guerrillas to launch political offensives against the enemy, writing slogans, printing and distributing propaganda materials, etc. In secondary education, Jiaodong alone has 26 secondary schools and above, with more than 6,000 students. Middle schools in Yantai, Weihaiwei, Longkou, and other places that are unwilling to be ruled by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits have also temporarily moved out of the city to continue classes. The Huazhong Second District established a worker-peasant school to improve the political and cultural level of rural hired and poor peasant components and party cadres, and prepare for the transformation and strengthening of district and township governments. The Yancheng District has determined a new policy of \"education serving the liberated masses, and schools belonging to the liberated masses,\" so that schools are run, managed, and studied by the people. Before the land reform, only 10% of the hired and poor students in Zefu Middle School in Ye Ting County were hired, but now it has increased sharply to 60%. Binhai and other places have trained a large number of new winter school teachers and village clerks and accountants to serve the village government after the land reform.\n\n　　In terms of mass cultural activities, nine counties in Huaihai have successively established worker-peasant cultural associations. Over the past year, the masses have created more than 40 complete scripts and more than 10 drum lyrics. Xinghua's liberated peasants in Suzhong have organized 47 drama troupes, of which 17 troupes have created 185 scripts and ditties, performed 325 times, and had 155,000 viewers.\n\n　　There have been many creations in wartime cultural work. Almost every village in Jiaodong has a \"broadcasting station\" (a high platform built in the center of the village), which has become a new tool for spreading victory news and educating the masses. The \"mobile bookstore\" in Zhentong has established more than 60 book and newspaper distribution points in the guerrilla environment, selling more than 58,000 copies of various books and newspapers, with more than 200,000 readers. Wherever there is a mass gathering, they carry their schoolbags and rush to it. In the marginal area, the method of carrying burdens is adopted. When the situation comes, the burdens are transferred; when the situation passes, the transaction is normal. During the extremely brutal \"encirclement and suppression,\" the mobile bookstore still shuttles back and forth, trading at night and transferring during the day. Every household of the liberated peasants in Zixin, Maoshan, and other districts has a \"Worker-Peasant Reader\" or \"Singing for Everyone\" and other reading materials. The \"Mobile Propaganda Team\" of Baoying Middle School consists of three people and three guns. They carry a huqin, carry a lime bucket, fight when they encounter the enemy, walk and sing when they encounter the enemy, and write. Cao Dejin of Tai County created a \"cultural backpack.\" He often carries colored paper and mimeographing equipment to follow the troops, and insists on writing propaganda materials in the fields during the most difficult \"bloody encirclement and suppression.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华东人民的文化军\n\n1948-01-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华东人民的文化军\n    华东各地文化工作为爱国自卫战争及农民翻身运动服务，一年来贡献极大。\n    在前线各纵队都设有新华支社，成百以上的人民记者深入连队，平时与战士同甘苦，战时则入战壕，甚至并肩作战，先后有模范记者宋大可、钱毅（作家阿英长子）等十人英勇牺牲，王传贯等四人光荣负伤。部队报纸在频繁战斗中坚持出报，华东解放军政治部华东前线报的铅印厂，长时期在卡车上跟部队辗转战地。各纵队、团都有油印报纸，成为鼓舞士气的有力武器，无数文艺工作者包括文工团、剧团、电影队、小学教师等，身临前线为战士服务。他们配合部队的宣教工作者，平时开展连队的文娱工作，战时即帮助挖工事救伤员。单胶东一地就有七十余文艺工作者奔赴战地，胶东军区政治部电影队赴火线出演“一只白帆船”等片。华东野战军政治部电影队则长期随军活动，演出了苏联名片“柏林之战”及自己摄制之“淮北轻骑队”等影片多种。随军新华书店翻印之苏联名著“恐惧与无畏”、“日日夜夜”的通俗本及“兵士兼统帅”、“我们的六连”等书均为广大指战员所争购，并成为教育部队的最好读物。胶东新华书店在八至十一月举办书刊劳军，购赠前线书刊四万余册及现款二二四万余元。滨海新华书店组织了战地文化服务队，巡回推销。\n    在后方，新华分支社遍及各军区、军分区。华中新华分社即拥有七个支社，干部六百余人，通讯员两万五千余人。每日来稿最多时达三千余篇。盐阜大众日报培养了工农记者，使报导上获显著成绩。报纸则有华东大众日报、胶东大众报、渤海日报、鲁中大众、鲁南时报、滨海农村、淮海报、黄海日报、苏北日报、江海报、拂晓报及各分区部队报、通俗化大众报、书报等三十四种。在渤海更有为回胞服务的伊斯兰报，从烟台、威海卫两地暂时转移之烟台日报、新威日报，仍在战争中坚持出版，均以最大篇幅登载人民武装活动消息。华中方面，由于适应新形势的发展，过去著名的新华日报华中版已于今年元旦复刊。\n    新华书店分支店及代销处遍布各县市及较大集镇。一年来山东新华书店总店编印各种书籍达三百多种，其中为工农喜爱的生产小丛书、大众文库各三三种。并为翻身农民及其教师专门出版了“文化翻身”半月刊。胶东新华书店出版书籍、课本共达一八○万册。其他在战争中坚持和诞生的大型杂志有山东文化、新华文摘、胶东文艺、江海杂志等多种，其中仅胶东文艺每期即销售万余册。胶东新华书店印行之“新党员读本”销售达十三万册。\n    在战争与紧张的支前复查与生产中，胶东每村正式小学仍照常开学，入学儿童达六十万。半工半读性的学习组织普及各地，有早班、午班、晚班等，以小先生制教育贫苦失学儿童。许多小学教师参加担架运输队进行文娱活动，许多涌入游击队与民兵并肩作战，莒县、竹庭、郯城三县即有二百余教师参加游击队对敌展开政治攻势，写标语、印发宣传品等。中学教育，仅胶东即有中等以上学校二十六所，学生六千余名。不甘蒋匪统治之烟台、威海卫、龙口等地之中学亦暂迁市外继续上课。华中二分区设立了工农学校，以提高乡村雇贫农成份及党员干部之政治文化水平，作改造和加强区乡政权之准备。盐阜区则确定“教育为翻身群众服务，学校为翻身群众所有”的新方针，使学校为民办、民管、民学。叶挺县泽夫中学土改前雇贫学生仅占百分之十，现已激增到百分之六十。滨海等地训练了大批新的冬学教师及村文书、会计，为土改后的村政权服务。\n    群众文化活动方面：淮海九个县相继成立了工农文协，一年来群众自己创作完整的剧本四十多种，鼓词十多种。苏中兴化翻身农民所组织之剧团达四十七个，其中十七个剧团就创作了剧本小调一八五种，演出三二五次，拥有观众十五万五千人。\n    战时文化工作更有不少创造，胶东各县几乎村村都有“广播台”（村子中央搭一高台）成为传播胜利消息及教育群众的新工具。溱潼“流动书店”在游击环境中建立了六十多个书报代销处，出售各种书报五万八千多份，拥有读者二十余万人。凡有群众集会处就背起书包赶去。在边沿区则采用挑担子方式，情况一来挑担子转移；情况一过又照常交易。在极残酷的“清剿”中，流动书店仍穿梭往来，夜晚交易，白天转移，梓辛、矛山等区翻身农民每户都有一本“工农读本”或“大家唱”之类的读物。宝应中学的“流动宣传队”由三个人三条枪组成，他们背着胡琴，提着石灰桶，遇敌就打，遇敌走唱、就写。泰县曹德进创造“文化背包”，他经常背着五色纸及油印器具跟随部队行动，在最艰苦的“血洗清剿”中坚持在田野里写宣传品。"

    "content": "Landlords Cause Trouble, Village Cadres Monopolize\n  　Poor and Hired Peasants in Nan Yanchi Fear Loans\n\n    [Our Dispatch] In the past, loan work in the fourth district of Jize had many problems. Village cadres monopolized everything, and poor and hired peasants who really needed money often could not get loans. This time, in order to break out of the circle of village cadres and thoroughly follow the mass line, district cadres prepared to first create some experience and then extend loans to all villages. District Chief Qin and eight others went to Nan Yanchi Village and went down separately to understand the situation and opinions of poor peasant households. At that time, the landlords took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying, \"There will be struggles again, investigating bad people...\" Some poor peasants barricaded their doors, and some locked their doors, unwilling to let the cadres go to their homes. When Li Wentai's father saw a cadre turn into the alley leading to his house, he ran home from the side, saying to his wife, \"Hurry out, the cadre is coming to our house, isn't it an investigation? You hurry out.\" His wife locked the door and went out in a panic. District Chief Qin went to the home of Zao Lan Niang, the poorest, and stated that our attitude towards loans was to help poor peasants with their difficulties and engage in sideline production. Zao Lan Niang said, \"Loans of grain and money can't reach our hands.\" The cadre asked, \"Why can't they reach you?\" She said, \"Last spring, I heard that the government was providing loans, so I went to the village chief Zhao Huanzhao and asked him to let me use a little! The village chief said no, you can't use it, you beg for food all day long, you don't have any valuable things at home, what are you going to repay with? I went home and was so angry that I couldn't do anything. I thought: The Eighth Route Army always says to let the poor people stand up, but I can't even use this little money? I found two poor peasants who hadn't received any money and went to District Chief Chen in the district, and the district chief said they could use it and gave me a letter. When I told the village chief about it, the village chief said that I had sued him in the district. He and the militia captain called the three of us to the team headquarters and scolded us severely, and also said they would beat us and hang us, scaring us to death. I dare not use money anymore.\" She also said, \"In the autumn, there were loans again, and I said a thousand good words, and finally used four thousand yuan. A few days ago, the government was collecting money, and after calculating, it was four thousand five hundred yuan including principal and interest. I couldn't pay it back, so the village cadres detained me, and there was no way to do anything. My family only had that door left, and the director took it away, calculated as selling for five thousand yuan. District Chief, don't say any more, I dare not use this loan this time, I'm afraid they will tear down my one and a half small houses again.\" After the cadres learned about these reflections from the poor and hired peasants, nine people divided into three groups and went deep into the three streets to mobilize the poor peasants and organize poor peasant groups, totaling forty households. A poor peasant meeting was held to expose the rumors and conspiracies of saboteurs, explaining the biases of past loans and that this time it must be loaned to the poor peasants. After the poor people's thinking was cleared, they recognized that the Communist Party was seeking benefits for the poor and allowing the poor to be masters of their own affairs. The poor peasants all made sideline production plans, and the whole village needed a total capital of 774,000 yuan, which solved the difficulties of the poor peasants in sideline production. The village's poor peasant group has been initially organized and is being expanded, and various sideline industries are also being developed. (Zhen An, Jin Bo)\n\n    The situation in Nan Yanchi Village exposes two serious problems: (1) The landlords have not been completely defeated and are still secretly active, spreading rumors and scaring the poor and hired peasants. (2) The village cadres are oppressing the poor and hired peasants, not only not giving them loans, but simply not treating them as human beings. When they can't repay the debt on time, they even take away their doors. It is good that the district cadres went directly to the poor and hired peasants to ask about their difficulties in order to solve their problems. However, is this approach truly relying on the poor and hired peasants and mobilizing the class line of the poor and hired peasants? The news does not make this clear. If the poor and hired peasants are not truly in charge, the landlords can never be defeated, and the cadres cannot be reformed. Enshrinement from top to bottom by district cadres cannot solve the problem.\n    　——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 地主捣乱村干包办　南砚池贫雇怕贷款\n振安　金波\n1948-01-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　地主捣乱村干包办\n  　南砚池贫雇怕贷款\n    【本报消息】鸡泽四区过去的贷款工作有好多毛病，村干部包办一切，真正需要钱用的贫雇农往往借不到款。这次贷款为了跳出村干部的圈子，彻底走群众路线，区里干部准备先创造一些经验，再普遍往各村贷。秦区长等九人到了南砚池村，分头深入下去，了解贫农户的情况和意见。当时地主乘机造谣说：“又要斗争哩，调查坏人啦……”贫农有的将门上住，有的将门锁住，都不愿叫干部去他家。李文太父亲见干部往他家那个过道一拐，就从一边大跑着回到家里，对他老婆子说：“赶快出去吧，干部正往咱家走哩，还不是调查吗？你快出去吧。”他老婆子锁住门，慌慌张张的就出去了。秦区长到最穷的皂兰娘家，表明了我们贷款的态度是为了帮助贫农困难，搞副业生产；皂兰娘说：“贷粮贷款使不到咱手里。”干部问：“怎么使不到？”她说：“年时春天我听说政府贷款哩，就去找村长赵焕朝，说叫我少使点吧！村长说不中，你不能使，你成天要饭，家里没有值钱毛，凭啥归还呢？俺回到家气的一点法儿也没有。我又想：八路军成天说叫穷人翻身，使这俩钱就不中？我找了两个没使到钱的贫农，到区里找陈区长，区长说能使，给开了个信。回村给村长一说，村长说俺往区里告他哩。他和民兵队长将俺三人叫到队部里，好训一顿，又说要打呀，吊呀，吓死人。俺是再也不敢使钱了。”她又说：“到秋天又贷款，俺说了好话万千，总算使了四千元。前几天政府收款哩，算了算，连本带利四千五百元。俺还不起，村干就将俺扣起来，没有一点办法了。我家就落了那个门，主任给拆走了，算卖五千元。区长别说了，这次贷款俺可不敢使了，俺怕再将这一间半小平房给拆了。”干部们了解到贫雇这些反映，九个人分成三个组，深入到三道街内发动贫农，组织贫农组，共组织了四十户。开了贫农会，揭发破坏分子的造谣阴谋，说明过去贷款的偏向，这次一定要贷到贫农手里。穷人思想打通后，认清了共产党是为穷人谋利益，叫穷人当家作主。贫农都订出了副业生产计划，全村共需资本七十七万四千元，就解决了贫农在副业中的困难。该村的贫农小组初步组织起来正在扩大中，各样副业亦在开展。（振安、金波）\n    南砚池村的情况暴露了两个严重的问题：（一）地主根本没有斗垮，还在暗中活动，大造谣言，吓唬贫雇。（二）村干部压在贫雇头上，不但不给贫雇贷款，简直不把贫雇当人，到期还不了帐，把门都给拿走了。区干部为了解决贫雇的困难，直接深入贫雇访问，这种热情是好的。但是，这种作法真正是依靠贫雇、发动贫雇的阶级路线吗？消息里没有说清楚。贫雇如果没有真正当家，绝不能打倒地主，改造干部。区干部从上而下的恩赐是不能解决问题的。\n    　——编者"

    "content": "【Taihang Dispatch, 10th】In the second, third, fourth, and sixth districts of Huguan, in order to ensure that hired and poor peasants truly receive loans, district cadres directly inspected the relending situation in the homes of hired and poor peasants, discovering many cases of falsely reported relending (note: relending means converting loans that were not originally given to hired and poor peasants to them). In the Hejungou sub-district of the sixth district, a meeting of village cadres was convened on December 12th last year to inspect loans. It was found that the total of new and old loans was 2,646,000 yuan. Except for 25,000 yuan used in Qiaoshang to help one hired and poor peasant household buy a head of livestock, the rest was lent to village cooperatives and mutual aid teams. At that time, it was decided that the loans should be completely transferred to hired and poor peasants within ten days. Later, when village cadres were asked, they said, \"It's been transferred!\" On the 25th, district cadres inspected the village and found that only half (1,296,000 yuan) had been relended to hired and poor peasants, and 950,000 yuan had not been relended; Wangjiazhuang and Nanzhang had not relended a single cent. District cadres in the third district held a meeting in Jinzhuang to inspect loans to hired and poor peasants and found that village cadres had falsely reported at the sub-district meeting that \"all loans have been transferred to hired and poor peasants.\" Of the 958,000 yuan in loans, only 10,000 yuan was actually lent to hired and poor peasants, and 748,000 yuan was still being lent to small-scale societies combining various classes, and 200,000 yuan was simply accumulated by village cadres and not lent out. Hired peasant Zhang Qiulu said: \"Lent to small-scale societies, we only get 5,000 yuan, the deficit is too big, we can't borrow more even if we want to.\" District cadres in the second district visited hired and poor peasants in Hanzhuang and found that village cadres were deceiving the hired and poor peasants. After they returned to the village from the district, the 810,000 yuan loan to the small-scale society was not touched at all. Cui Houze (old middle peasant), the vice-chairman of the Guojiatuo cooperative in the fourth district, was even worse. He took back 200,000 yuan in loans and put them in the cooperative without lending them out. When some hired and poor peasants went to borrow, he privately added another three points to the monthly interest rate of three points, scaring the hired and poor peasants who were afraid they couldn't repay the money and didn't dare to borrow. After discovering these false reports, cadre meetings were held in each village to examine and trace the root causes of the problem. Village cadres in Hanzhuang confessed that they were \"afraid that the small-scale society would collapse if the loans were relended\"; some said they were \"afraid that the hired and poor peasants would not be able to repay.\" These confessions are incomplete; they intend to use these confessions to cover up their selfish and self-interested thoughts of taking advantage of the poor and hired. Now district cadres in each district are supporting the hired and poor peasants, clearing the ideological stumbling blocks of the village cadres, and seizing the time to carry out relending.

This matter is very important. In the past, some cadres had old mindsets, learning the ways of Kuomintang officials and landlords acting like local bullies. Their minds were sharp, always looking for loopholes; their hands were long, grabbing public money and treating it as their own. Not to mention the distant past, just consider some of our village cadres. They didn't distribute the fruits of our struggle against landlords to us poor people, moving things back to their own homes and pocketing the money. When running cooperatives, they only asked us to invest, and after a year or so, there was no accounting. Even if there was, it was a muddled mess. No one knew if it was a profit or a loss, and everyone suspected something fishy, but no one dared to speak up. Even if they did, they'd be falsely accused, and there was no way to deal with it. Now, things are better. With this decree from the Border Region Government, no matter how big or small the cadre, civilian or military, if they are corrupt, we will not be lenient. We will follow the law and send them to the People's Court for trial. Those who are heavily corrupt (embezzling the equivalent of more than 7,000 catties of millet) will be executed, and those who are lightly corrupt (embezzling less than 100 catties of millet equivalent) will be dismissed and given demerits. All embezzled goods must be returned. This way, cadres who don't want to work for us and want to take advantage of us will not be able to get away with it. From now on, we will watch.

    "content": "Opinions on the \"Labor-Capital Cooperation\" in Mapingtou Village\n\n　　This winter, many places in our border region have been enthusiastically engaged in winter production, making quite a stir. The leadership has said that we must rely on the poor and hired peasants and let them be masters of their own affairs. However, after inspection, many poor and hired peasants have not yet turned over, lacking food, drink, clothing, and bedding, making it impossible to produce. Therefore, some places have come up with a method, saying that they want to promote mutual aid and borrowing among middle and poor peasants, which means planning to tap into the resources of middle peasants to help poor and hired peasants \"become prosperous.\" We believe this approach is very inappropriate.\n\n　　Originally, middle and poor peasants were a united force to overthrow landlords and equally distribute land, they were like one family. It is acceptable for middle peasants to willingly lend money or goods to help poor peasants who have just turned over and lack resources to start production. However, the current reality is clearly not the case. In many places, land reform is not thorough, landlords have not been thoroughly struggled against, cadres have taken the rich peasant route, and the distribution of fruits is unfair, which has not satisfied the demands of landless and land-poor peasants. Judging from the material published today about Mapingtou Village in Jincheng, it is safe to say that the poor and hired peasants there have not turned over. Instead of seeking the reasons why the poor and hired peasants have not turned over, and examining whether the landlords have not been thoroughly struggled against or whether the distribution of fruits is unfair, the leadership is instead trying to \"break through the middle peasant ideology\" and harm the interests of the middle peasants, letting the middle peasants fill the holes of the poor and hired peasants. This approach is not in line with the fundamental spirit of the Party's May 4th Directive, nor is it in line with the spirit of the Land Law. As Comrade Mao Zedong said well in \"The Present Situation and Our Tasks\": \"During land reform, the middle peasants expressed their approval of equal distribution, because equal distribution does not harm the middle peasants. During equal distribution, a portion of the middle peasant's land remains unchanged, a portion increases, and only a small number of well-off middle peasants have a small amount of surplus land, which they are also willing to take out for equal distribution, because after equal distribution, their land tax burden will be reduced.\" The practice in Mapingtou Village is not in line with the spirit of Chairman Mao. Doing so will inevitably disrupt the peasant ranks, disperse strength, and break up the unity of middle and poor peasants.\n\n　　But what we must pay the most attention to is why this phenomenon is happening today? This is mainly because some selfish cadres are unwilling to give up the fruits they have gained too much, or they are protecting the landlords and are unwilling to struggle against them again. Some also want to use the method of harming the middle peasants to redeem their own sins towards the poor and hired peasants, and as a result, the interests of all peasants are harmed. Leaders must be very clear-headed about this situation and should thoroughly investigate it, and not let it continue to develop. By no means should we allow landlords, rich peasants, and village cadres from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds to take advantage of the loopholes. Now that the Party's Land Law Outline has been published, we must act in accordance with the regulations. We must return the fruits that were gained too much, and the landlords who have not been thoroughly struggled against must be thoroughly struggled against. We firmly believe that only by doing so can we truly satisfy the demands of the vast number of hired and poor peasants in Mapingtou Village.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 对马坪头村“劳资合作”的意见\n\n1948-01-13\n第1版()\n专栏：短论\n\n　　对马坪头村“劳资合作”的意见\n    今年冬天，咱们边区好多地方都在热烘烘的搞冬季生产，热闹了一大阵。领导上说的是要依靠贫雇，让贫雇当家，但经过检查，很多贫雇还没翻身，少吃没喝、少穿没盖，没法生产。于是有的地方便想了一个办法，说是要让中贫农互助互借，也就是要从中农身上打算盘来帮助贫雇“生产发家”，这种办法我们认为很不妥当。\n    本来中贫农是一个共同打倒地主、平分土地的队伍，是一家人，中贫农之间两相情愿，中农借出钱、借出东西来帮助刚翻身没抵垫的贫农生产是可以的；现在的实际情况显然不是这样，有很多地方土地改革不彻底，地主没斗透，干部走了富农路线，果实分配不公，因而也就没有满足了无地少地农民的要求。就从今天发表的晋城马坪头村的材料看，那里贫雇可以肯定说没有翻身，领导上不去寻找贫雇没有翻身的原因，看看是不是地主没有斗透？是不是果实分配不公道？而是去“突破中农思想”，损害中农利益，让中农去补贫雇窟窿。这种做法既不合于党的五四指示的根本精神，更不合于土地法的精神；毛泽东同志在“目前形势和我们的任务”一文中说的好：“土地改革中，中农表现赞成平分，这是因为平分并不损害中农。在平分时，中农一部分土地不变动，一部分增加了土地，只有一部分富裕中农有少数多余的土地，他们也愿意拿出来平分，这是因为在平分后土地税的负担他们出减轻了”。马坪头村的作法是不合于毛主席精神的，这样做的结果一定把农民阵营打乱，力量分散，拆散中贫农的团结。\n    但是最值得我们注意的乃是为什么在今天发生这种现象？这主要是有一部分自私自利的干部，不愿退出多得果实，或者是对地主有包庇不愿再斗，也有的想拿损害中农的办法，来向贫雇赎自己的罪，结果，是损害了全体农民的利益。领导者对这种情形，必须十分清醒，应该彻底调查，不能让它再继续发展，千万不能让地主富农及地富出身的村干部在一旁钻空子。现在党的土地法大纲已经公布了，一定要按照规定的办事。多得果实必须退出，地主未斗透必须斗透，我们坚决相信，只有这样做，才能真正满足了马坪头村广大雇贫的要求。"

Correspondent Li Minggen, who had been to the Chen Su troops, also told everyone: \"They are just good, the correspondents are clear about their tasks, and they are efficient.\" This greatly strengthened the unity between the two armies.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 平汉前线我军　再次收复许昌城\n\n1948-01-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　平汉前线我军\n  　再次收复许昌城\n    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线十一日电】解放军六日再克许昌，并在城北刘庄拦击自城内北逃的蒋匪暂编二十六旅后卫一个营，活捉敌副营长以下六十五名。按许昌是一日被敌重占的。\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线九日电】平汉前线陈粟、陈谢两大解放军在会师的狂欢中，展开了热烈的相互学习运动。豫陕鄂解放军政治部特号召自己部队向陈粟大军学习战斗纪律；学习正规作战，大量歼灭敌人；学习部队深入土改教育及团结友爱等优良作风。某部一会到陈粟大军，就组织了一个包括各种干部的参观团，连长参观连的工作，排长参观排的工作。某纵队并派一个包括三个部长的参观组，发现陈粟部队在土改学习中经过贫雇为核心的群众路线来改造领导，改造干部思想和深入的立功表模运动等许多宝贵的经验和创造，准备带回自己部队学习。去过陈粟部队的通讯员李明根也向大家介绍说：“人家就是好，通讯员对自己的任务都明明白白，精精干干”。这大大亲密了两军的团结。"

    "content": "[This newspaper's news] The Jincheng Labor People's Daily published a message on the 28th of last month saying: \"Mapingtou Village, Third District, has broken through the middle peasant thinking, solved the difficulties of hired and poor peasants, and implemented large-scale mutual aid of labor and animal power.\" This village did not mobilize the poor and hired peasants by thoroughly struggling against the landlords and fairly and reasonably distributing the fruits to solve the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants. Instead, it \"mobilized\" the capital and animal power of the middle peasants to \"help\" the poor and hired peasants who had not yet been liberated. When the middle peasants were unwilling, they went to \"get through their thinking.\" \"Breaking through the middle peasant thinking\" is actually a top-down mandatory order that harms the interests of the middle peasants to \"benefit\" the poor and hired peasants. It is also described as \"labor-capital cooperation,\" treating the relationship between middle and poor peasants as a labor-capital relationship, which is completely wrong. We believe that relying on the poor and hired peasants to unite the middle peasants is a complete line for implementing thorough and fair distribution. The practice of Mapingtou Village will create disunity between the middle and poor peasants, isolate the poor and hired peasants, and let the landlords and rich peasants watch the joke from the sidelines and escape the struggle. As a result, it will inevitably harm the fundamental interests of the poor and hired peasants, preventing us from truly realizing the Outline Land Law of China. We are now introducing this news for everyone to study: Mapingtou Village has 126 households, of which 25 are hired and poor peasants, most of whom only have one month's worth of food. The small hired worker Li Nuoshun and his wife have a total of four dou of grain. After giving it to his younger sister, he has to work as a hired hand for others. The carpenter Yuan Wangbao wants to go out to work as a carpenter, but his wife and children have nothing to eat right now; other hired and poor peasants either have no labor or no capital. The village held a village-wide meeting on the night of the 12th to solve the difficulties of the hired and poor peasants and implement labor-capital cooperation. However, it was immediately met with serious resistance from the middle peasants, and some middle peasants believed that this was the \"equalization\" in last year's land reform. Middle peasant Yuan Beifang said: \"No, even if I can't afford to feed my livestock with wheat straw, I can still accumulate manure.\" After saying that, he left. Yuan Haishui angrily took out the cow he had obtained in the struggle and said: \"Give this cow to you to use! Whether it gets thin or fat, even if it dies, it has nothing to do with me.\" The woman Yuan Xiaocai cursed behind her back after taking out half a donkey at the meeting: \"What the hell are we liberating for! Isn't it just for others?\" Yuan Lixun's woman didn't sleep all night, thinking that the struggle had come to her. Some even criticized the hired and poor peasants, saying: Can he be called a hired and poor peasant? We are also hired and poor peasants. Two kinds of thoughts also occurred among the hired and poor peasants: one was that this was great, and some of the extra fruits should be distributed; the other was that if there was no grain, there would be grain, and if there was no money to use, there would be money to use. On the second night, separate meetings were held for new and old middle peasants and hired and poor peasants. The old middle peasants discussed the difficulties of the hired and poor peasants and the methods of labor-capital cooperation. In addition to this, the new middle peasants recalled their previous lives as hired and poor peasants in order to enlighten and take the lead in solving the difficulties of the hired and poor peasants. The hired and poor peasants told of their current difficulties, such as lack of labor, livestock, capital, or food, and discussed ways to solve the difficulties. It was not until the third day that the thinking of the middle peasants was reversed: Yuan Xiaocai said: \"After we have been liberated, we should also help the hired and poor peasants to be liberated. I am willing to lend half a donkey to the hired and poor peasants to use, so that both parties can benefit, and let the hired and poor peasants get more profit, so as to catch up with us.\" Yuan Beifang also changed his mind and was willing to help the hired and poor peasants. He said: \"I am also willing to take out the cow that I got from the struggle for the hired and poor peasants to use and implement labor-capital cooperation.\" The old middle peasant Yuan Yuanlin said: \"There is a way. In addition to lending our donkey cart to the hired and poor peasants, we also have a cart and three winnowing fans that we will lend out together, as well as woolen pockets. If they are broken, I will repair them, and if the furniture is broken, I will fix it.\" Shi Wenming said: \"I am willing to take out 10,000 yuan to be used as capital for the hired and poor peasants.\" The hired and poor peasants also corrected the idea of relying on relief or \"dividing the fruits\" and wanted to implement labor-capital cooperation with the middle peasants. On the third day, the whole village discussed the combination of labor, animal power, and capital. Middle peasant Li Haishui said: \"Let's implement a three-way combination. Those who have livestock contribute livestock, those who have labor contribute labor, and those who have money contribute money! After combining, the money earned will first give the hired and poor peasants a 30% dividend, and the rest will be divided according to work points regardless of whether they are hired, poor or middle peasants.\" Shi Wenming said: \"Those who can transport should transport, those who can go down to the coal mines should go down to the coal mines, everyone should provide capital if capital is needed, and everyone should provide livestock if livestock is needed.\" Yuan Xiaocai said: \"Our middle peasant women should help the hired and poor women. When they first learn to spin cotton, two liang can be equivalent to one work point, and weaving five chi of cloth can also be equivalent to one work point (middle peasant women spin four liang of cotton for one work point and weave one zhang of cloth for one work point).\" Elderly people who cannot spin or weave can earn work points by twisting cotton rolls and taking care of children. Some people are even willing to give their dividends to the hired and poor peasants first, and then divide them for themselves in the future. The old mutual aid groups were also reorganized, absorbing the hired and poor peasants to help each other and exchange work. The group leaders were re-elected or elected from among the hired and poor peasants or those who came from hired and poor backgrounds. Then, specific organization was carried out, using a self-reporting method. Starting with the fourth group first, people could do whatever they wanted and engage in whatever they wanted. Li Xiaoniu reported that he could not run or carry things, but he could lead the young people in the group to pull coal and collect manure. Textile expert Liu Chunfeng was willing to lead the textile work and patiently pass on her skills to the hired and poor women. Yuan Lixun's woman \"was willing\" to give a mule cart to the group to use and lend out another 20,000 yuan as capital... Based on the existing conditions, a long-distance transportation group, a short-distance transportation group, and a textile group were established, which were divided into three subgroups: one weaving factory, two spinning factories, as well as a tobacco workshop, and a grenade-throwing handle. Other groups also adopted the self-reporting method to form various subgroups and implemented work exchange between large groups. For example, the first group had more labor, and the sixth group had more animal power, so they also helped each other and exchanged work. Now the whole village has begun large-scale mutual aid and is brewing methods for dividing dividends between the hired and poor peasants and the middle peasants. They also put forward slogans such as \"Farmers all over the world are one family, helping hired and poor peasants get rich and settle down, and the famine of hired and poor peasants is our famine!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋城马坪头村实行“劳资合作”  强制中农借物借钱必将造成贫雇孤立  中农不愿借出资本硬来开会打通思想  强迫中农拿出大车牲口，还要纠正贫雇平分果实思想  纺花变工，强制中农“照顾”贫雇\n\n1948-01-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋城马坪头村实行“劳资合作”\n    强制中农借物借钱必将造成贫雇孤立\n    中农不愿借出资本硬来开会打通思想\n    强迫中农拿出大车牲口，还要纠正贫雇平分果实思想\n    纺花变工，强制中农“照顾”贫雇\n    【本报消息】晋城劳动人民报在上月二十八号登了一条消息说：“三区马坪头村突破中农思想，解决雇贫困难，实行劳力、畜力大互助。”该村不是从斗透地主，公平合理分配果实上来发动贫雇，解决贫雇困难，而是“动员”中农的资本、畜力来“帮助”未翻身的贫雇。中农不愿意，就去“打通思想”。“突破中农思想”，实际上是自上而下的强迫命令，损害了中农利益去“为”贫雇，还说成是“劳资合作”，把中贫农关系看做是劳资关系，这是十分错误的。我们认为依靠贫雇农联合中农是执行彻底平分的一条完整的路线，马坪头村的做法，将会造成中贫农之间的不团结，孤立贫雇，让地主富农在一旁看笑话，逃避斗争。其结果必将损害了贫雇的根本利益，使我们不能真正实现中国土地法大纲。现特介绍这篇消息，供大家研究：马坪头村有一百二十六户，其中有廿五户为雇贫，大部只有一月粮食；小雇工李诺顺两口人，总共打四斗粮食，给了妹子外，自己又得给人家当小伙计过活。木匠原王保，想出去作木匠，但老婆孩子当下就没吃的；其他雇贫或没劳力或没本钱。该村即于十二号夜召开全村大会，为雇贫解决困难，实行劳资合作。可是马上遭到中农思想严重抵抗，部分中农认为：这是去年土地改革中的“拉平”。中农原北方说：“不能，哪怕俺的牲口喂不起喂麦楷，也可以积粪。”说完就走了。原海水生气的把在斗争中得到的牛拿出来说：“把这个牛给你们使吧！使瘦了，使胖了，那怕使死了，与我无干。”妇女原小彩在大会上把半个驴拿出来后，背后就骂开了：“翻他妈的什么身！还不是翻给人家了？”原立勋女人一夜没睡着，认为这是斗争到自己头上了。更有的指摘雇贫说：他能叫雇贫？咱也雇贫。在雇贫中亦发生了两种思想：一种是这可好了，多得的果实就该分些出来。另一种是以为没粮食就有粮食了，没钱使倒有钱使了。第二夜就分别召开新老中农与雇贫会议，老中农讨论雇贫困难与劳资合作办法，新中农除此外，还回忆以前的雇贫生活，以便启发及带头解决雇贫困难。在雇贫中诉说目前的苦处，如没劳力、没牲口、没本钱、或没粮食等等困难，并讨论解决困难的办法。第三天才扭转了中农的思想：原小彩说：“咱们翻了身，也要帮助雇贫翻身才对。我愿拿出半个驴来借给雇贫使用，双方得利，让雇贫多得些利，好追上咱们。”原北方也转变了，愿意帮助雇贫，他说：“我也愿意拿出斗争来的牛，给雇贫使用，实行劳资合作。”老中农原元林说：“有办法，除把咱的一辆驴车借给雇贫使用外，咱还有一辆车、三个簸篮也一齐借出来，还有毛连口袋，破了我补，家具坏了我修。”史文明说：“我愿意拿出一万块钱，来给雇贫作本钱。”雇贫中亦纠正了依靠救济或“分果实”的思想，要和中农实行劳资合作。第三天全村讨论劳力、畜力、资本结合办法，中农李海水说：“咱们实行三结合，有牲口出牲口，有劳力出劳力，有钱出钱！结合起来，赚回钱先给雇贫提三分红，其余不管雇贫中农按工分红。”史文明说：“能运输的作运输，能下煤窑的下煤窑，要本钱大家给本钱，要牲口大家给牲口。”原小彩说“咱中农妇女要帮助雇贫妇女，她们初学纺花，二两也可以顶一工，织五尺布也可以顶一工（中农妇女纺四两花一工，织一丈布一工）。”老年人不能纺织，搓花卷看孩子也可以顶工。甚至有些人愿意先把自己红利分给雇贫，将来再给自己分。又将旧有的互助组整顿了一下，吸收了雇贫互助变工，改选或推选雇贫或雇贫出身的组长；随后进行具体组织，将用自报方式，首先从第四组开始，愿意干什么就干什么，愿意搞什么就搞什么，李小牛自报不能跑，不能担，但能带领组里的小青年人拉炭、拾粪。纺织行家刘春凤，愿意领导纺织，并把自己的本领耐心传给雇贫妇女。原立勋女人“愿意”将一辆骡车给组里使用，再借出两万块钱来作资本……。根据现有条件，成立了长途运输组、短程运输组，纺织组又分三个小组：一个织布厂，两个纺花厂，以及烟坊，砍手掷弹把的。其他各组也采用自报方式，组成各小组，而且实行大组与大组变工。如第一组劳力多，第六组畜力多，也互助变工。现全村已开始大互助，并酝酿雇贫与中农的分红办法。他们并且提出了“天下农民是一家，帮助雇贫农发财安家，雇贫农的饥荒，就是我们的饥荒！”等口号。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 11th: The Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army's field units convened a meeting of Party member cadres in November of last year to convey the spirit and resolutions of the National Land Conference and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Land Conference. The conference decided that the entire army would participate in land reform and simultaneously carry out a general Party rectification and military consolidation movement. At the meeting, General Luo Ruiqing, Deputy Political Commissar of the Military Region, pointed out: Mass work is one of the three major tasks of our army, and today it means participating in land reform. Our predecessor, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, had the glorious tradition of \"overthrowing local bullies and distributing land,\" which we must inherit and promote well today. The headquarters' declaration calls on us to learn two skills: annihilating the enemy and awakening the masses. Awakening the masses means helping the peasants to turn over. The army's participation in land reform can boost the peasants' momentum; and can enhance the army's mass perspective, strengthen the relationship between the army and the people, and between the army and the local government (army and local areas), raise the class consciousness of commanders and fighters, and greatly strengthen the army's combat effectiveness. Party rectification and military consolidation within the army itself is an extremely important condition, so the army should attach extreme importance to the implementation of this political task. Deputy Political Commissar Luo also put forward several principles: (1) Re-conduct land reform education to eliminate ideological obstacles, announce the law on punishing violations of people's interests and the discipline in participating in land reform, and strictly prohibit obstructing and sabotaging land reform, and shielding landlords and rich peasants from illegal activities. (2) The army's participation in land reform is under the unified leadership of the local Party. (3) The company's soldiers' committee will set up a land reform work group to be responsible for land investigation, propaganda, and organization of the masses in the garrison area. (4) The field army will transfer good cadres and soldiers to participate in the land reform work teams in relevant areas. (5) Fixed garrison agencies, schools, and troops will participate in land reform work in the garrisoned villages. (6) All troops and garrison agencies should mobilize all personnel to participate in mass meetings to pour out grievances, cheer for the peasants, carry out class education in the troops, and may also transfer a certain number of people to participate in nearby local work teams. (7) Carry out propaganda and investigation in the Chiang area, and when conditions are ripe, the political organs should cooperate with local organizations to form work teams to mobilize the masses. (8) Protect the peasants' struggle to turn over in the border areas, and be responsible for guarding and covering the distribution of land and floating wealth. (9) Write letters home: encourage hired and poor peasant soldiers to encourage their families to participate in the struggle, and those from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds should advise and warn their families to abide by the land law, obey the new peasant association, and not engage in any illegal activities. (10) Handle the registration and notification of liberated soldiers in accordance with the method of distributing land to liberated soldiers. (11) Resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary armed rebellions that may be launched by landlords and rich peasants.\n    Regarding the issue of Party rectification and military consolidation in the army, Deputy Political Commissar Luo said: The impurity within the army's Party and the unhealthy work style are also very serious. In some leadership links, landlords and rich peasants are \"in command\" for a time, instead of our leading cadres.\n    Regarding the specific methods of Party rectification and military consolidation in the army, Deputy Political Commissar Luo pointed out: (1) Carry out a movement to check class background, check ideology, and check work style among all army cadres, and a movement to pour out grievances among the soldiers. (2) Carry out organizational adjustments in important leading organs and several leading links. (3) Clean out class aliens who have infiltrated into rear agencies and production departments. (4) Ideologically degenerate, corrupt, and fallen elements cannot assume leadership positions without correction and testing. (5) Increase the power of Party committees at all levels, and the chiefs should obey the leadership of the Party committee. (6) All matters in the company should go through the branch, so that the branch becomes the highest leading organ in the company. (7) Establish soldiers' committees in companies and food units, giving soldiers economic and political democracy, regularly conduct criticism and appraisal of cadres and Party members, Party members of the branch should be open in the company, and listen to the opinions of the soldiers' meeting on the admission and expulsion of Party members; the company's soldiers' committee should be based on outstanding elements of workers, hired and poor peasants.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 11th: The Political Department of the Ji-Zhong Military Region recently ordered the entire army to participate in the land reform movement. (A) Assist the villages in the garrison area to carry out the following tasks: (1) Investigate the masses' reactions to land reform and the destructive activities of landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements, and promptly report them to the sub-district representative meetings or the poor peasant group representative meetings. (2) Publicize the Outline Land Law and the joint announcement and letter to the peasants. (3) If landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements resist and sabotage land reform, it is necessary to assist the peasants in suppressing them. (4) Assist in the implementation of all resolutions of the poor peasant groups and the new peasant associations.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. According to consolidated news from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas: The peasant uprisings and armed forces in Sichuan, Kangding, and Guizhou provinces continue to develop. In Sichuan alone, there are over a hundred large and small units, distributed across a wide area, constantly engaged in fierce battles with the bandit troops under the jurisdiction of Chiang Kai-shek's Chongqing Headquarters throughout the past year. Several peasant armed forces have begun to mobilize the masses and establish unified leadership organizations. The situation of each unit: (1) The largest in scale is the high-quality peasant armed force along the Jialing River in northern Sichuan, in Guangyuan, Wangcang, Nanjiang, and other counties, which has now expanded to Tongjiang, Bazhong, Cangxi on the east bank of the Jialing River, and Pingwu, Jiangyou, Beichuan, Maoxian, and other places west of the Jiange Mountains on the west bank, cooperating with local peasant armed forces, calling on peasants to resist grain requisitioning, conscription, and taxation, and oppose local tyrants, with peasants rising up in large numbers. This unit emerged in the spring of 1946, with its main base in the 600-li long and 300-li wide mountain forest area of Sandaohe in Wangcang, possessing tens of thousands of men and weapons. In addition to rifles and machine guns, they also have heavy artillery and mortars. In August 1946, they defeated four routes of attacks by two regular brigades of Chiang's bandits and local regiments from Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, and completely annihilated the detective brigade of the 15th Administrative District of Sichuan Province. (2) A unit of more than two thousand people on the border of Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Hubei is a long-standing peasant armed force. The leader was originally Peng Chunrong, but after Peng's death in battle, Qu Bogai continued to lead, operating in Youyang and Xiushan in Sichuan, and Sangzhi and Yongshun in Hunan, with its base in the Bamian Mountains. In 1946 and 1947, they shattered many attacks by Pan Wenhua's pacification forces of Chiang's bandits. Now this unit has established a political department, posting anti-Chiang slogans at any time, and formulated four combat principles, including breaking up into smaller units to avoid \"encirclement and suppression,\" and consolidating smaller units to eliminate small enemy forces. (3) In the area bordering Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, in counties such as Gusong, Gulan, Pingshan, Qingfu, Changning, Nanxi, Jiang'an, Hongxian, Junlian, Xuyong, Gaoxian, Yibin, Shuchuan, Xingwen, and Weixin in Yunnan, and Bijie in Guizhou, there are more than ten units, totaling more than three thousand people in 1946, which were jointly organized by seventeen leaders such as Yin Lucai, Chen Xianglin, and Zeng Zirong into the \"Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou General Headquarters,\" which developed to more than ten thousand people in 1947. Even Chiang's bandit newspapers reported that in Qingfu, Changning, and Nanxi counties alone, there were 80,000 people. (4) In the Qionglai mountain area of the Emei Mountains in western Sichuan, in Qionglai, Mingshan, Hongya, Pujiang, Emei, Dayi, and other counties, there were only a few small units active in 1946, but in 1947, the Han-Yi peasant armed forces developed to tens of thousands of people, defeating an attack by one regular brigade and two security regiments of Chiang's bandits. (5) In the Minjiang River basin northwest of Chengdu, in Chongqing, Guanxian, Wenchuan, and other counties, there are several peasant armed forces, one of which, with more than a thousand people, has been active for many years, led by figures from secret societies such as Chen Fu'an. In addition to rifles, they have several steel cannons and dozens of machine guns. Last month, the deputy director of Chiang's Sichuan Provincial Security Department led a team to invade, and the battle is about to begin. (6) In Songpan, Lifan, Maoxian, Maogong, and other counties in the upper reaches of the Minjiang River, there are more than 10,000 Han-Yi peasant armed forces led by Ji Xingwu. In 1946, they shattered the \"encirclement and suppression\" by Chiang's bandits, and in 1947, they inflicted heavy casualties on the invading Chiang's bandits. (7) In the Huarong Mountains of eastern Sichuan, in the seven counties of Linshui, Dianjiang, Yuechi, Wusheng, Hechuan, Jiangbei, and Changshou, there are two or three thousand people in the units of Deng Julin, Wu Weisan, Wu Xianwen, Li Fuqing, and others, using the mountainous area as their base. In the autumn of 1946, they defeated the \"suppression\" by two divisions of the American-equipped 14th Army of Chiang's bandits. Subsequently, they continued to develop, forcing Chiang's bandits to plan to establish a \"Huarong Mountain Suppression Command Post\" in Chongqing last winter, attempting to carry out \"suppression\" again. (8) The remaining units are active in the triangular area between the Daba Mountains and the Yangtze River in northeastern Sichuan, in Wushan, Wuxi, Fengjie, Yunyang, Wanxian, @Du, Changshou, Kaixian, Chengkou, Wanyuan, Daxian, Liangshan, Dazhu, Guang'an, Quxian, and in the area of the Qianjiang River basin in Fuling, Nanchuan, Pengshui, Chongqing, and its nearby Baxian, Bishan, Yongchuan, Jiangjin, Qijiang. In the Jialing River basin in Zhaohua, Nanbu, and Nanchong. In the Fujiang River basin in Anxian, Mianxian, Zhongjiang, Shehong, Pengxi, and Tongnan. In the Tuojiang River basin in Lezhi, Anyue, Dazu, Rongchang, Longchang, Fushun, Neijiang, Zizhong, Ziyang, Jianyang, Shifang, and Mianzhu. In the Minjiang River basin in Pixian, Chongning, Wenjiang, Shuangliu, Huayang, Xinjin, Pengshan, Meishan, Danleng, Renshou, Jiajiang, Jingyan, Leshan, and the counties bordering Sichuan, Kangding, and Yunnan, such as Leibo, Mabian, and Ebian.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 武装起来抗粮抗丁抗税　川康黔农民到处起义  川东华蓥山区打退蒋匪两个美械师  西康夷族反蒋共有人枪十六万\n\n1948-01-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　武装起来抗粮抗丁抗税\n  　川康黔农民到处起义\n    川东华蓥山区打退蒋匪两个美械师\n    西康夷族反蒋共有人枪十六万\n    【新华社陕北十日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：川、康、黔三省民变武装继续发展中。计：四川大小百余部，分布地区甚广，去年一年不断与蒋贼重庆行辕所辖匪部激战。若干民变武装已开始发动群众及建立统一领导机构。各部队情况：（一）规模最大的川北嘉陵江沿岸广元、旺苍、南江等县质地优良的民变武装，现已发展到嘉陵江东岸的通江、巴中、苍溪及西岸的剑阁门山脉以西之平武、江油、北川、茂县等地，与当地民变武装合作，号召农民抗粮、抗丁、抗税及反对土劣，农民纷纷起义。该部系崛起于一九四六年春，主要根据地为旺苍三道河长六百里宽三百里之山林区，拥有人枪数万，其武器除机步枪外尚有重炮与迫击炮。四六年八月曾击溃蒋匪两个正规旅及川陕鄂地方团队之四路进攻，并全歼川省第十五行政区侦缉大队。（二）川黔湘鄂边境一部二千余人，为多年民变武装，领袖原为彭春荣，后彭阵亡，由瞿伯垓继续领导，活动于川境酉阳、秀山，湘境桑植、永顺一带，根据地为八面山。四六、四七两年曾粉碎蒋匪绥靖主任潘文华部之多次进攻。现该部已设政治部，随时张贴反蒋标语，并订出化整为零避免“围剿”，化零为整消灭小部敌人等四条作战方针。（三）川滇黔边境古宋、古兰、屏山、庆符、长宁、南溪、江安、洪县、筠连、叙永、高县、宜宾、沭川、兴文及滇境威信，黔境毕节等县，大小十余部，四六年共三千余人，由殷禄才、陈祥林、曾子荣等十七领袖合组“川滇黔总司令部”，四七年发展至万余人，甚至蒋匪报纸报导仅庆符、长宁、南溪三县即有八万人。（四）川西峨嵋山脉邛崃山区之邛崃、名山、洪雅、蒲江、峨嵋、大邑等县，四六年只有几个小部活动，四七年汉夷民变武装发展达万人，曾击败蒋匪一个正规旅，两个保安团的进攻。（五）成都西北岷江流域崇庆、灌县、汶川等县有民变武装数部，其中一部一千余人已活动多年，领袖为帮会人物陈福安等，除步枪外拥有钢炮数门机枪数十挺。上月蒋匪川省保安处副处长率队进犯，战事即将展开。（六）岷江上游松潘、理番、茂县、懋功等县有季星武率领之汉夷民武装一万余，四六年曾粉碎蒋匪之“围剿”，四七年又给进犯蒋匪以重大杀伤。（七）川东华蓥山区邻水、垫江、岳池、武胜、合川、江北、长寿七县境内有邓巨林、伍畏三、伍显文、李福清等部两三千人，以该山地为根据地。四六年秋曾战胜蒋匪美械第十四军两个师的“进剿”，其后继续发展，迫使蒋匪去年冬拟于重庆设“华蓥山清剿指挥所”，妄图再事“进剿”。（八）其余各部分别活动于川东北大巴山脉与长江间三角地带之巫山、巫溪、奉节、云阳、万县、＠都、长寿、开县、城口、万源、达县、梁山、大竹、广安、渠县及黔江流域之涪陵、南川、彭水、重庆及其附近之巴县、壁山、永川、江津、綦江。嘉陵江流域之昭化、南部、南充。涪江流域之安县、绵县、中江、射洪、篷溪、潼南。沱江流域之乐至、安岳、大足、荣昌、隆昌、富顺、内江、资中、资阳、简阳、什邡、绵竹。岷江流域之郫县、崇宁、温江、双流、华阳、新津、彭山、眉山、丹棱、仁寿、夹江、井研、乐山及川康滇边境之雷波、马边、峨边等县。"

Last May, when the People's Liberation Army attacked the Doudian Railway Station in Liangxiang, only twenty soldiers occupied the station without firing a single shot; the Chiang bandit garrison had rolled up their bedding in advance and fled. In the battle to attack Matou Town in Zhuoxian County, the Chiang bandit newspapers deceived people by saying, \"Many communists were killed,\" but in fact, the Chiang bandit army fled without firing a single shot again. More than 3,000 Chiang bandit security team members lived near Fangshan County, and when they heard that the People's Liberation Army was about to attack, they quickly withdrew. The day after the People's Liberation Army captured Shijiazhuang, the secretary-general of the Hebei Chiang bandit provincial government escorted more than seventy cars from Baoding to Beiping. The pseudo-councilor himself also said dejectedly, \"This meeting is still being held in Beiping. Will the next meeting be able to return to Baoding instead of going to Nanjing or Hong Kong?\" The pseudo-councilors' speeches also revealed that Chiang bandit officers and soldiers were extorting the common people everywhere. In Xincheng County, each mu of land yielded nine dou of grain. Even petty officers had to have the local area share the cost of their marriages. Trees as thick as bowls were all cut down. The Chiang bandits took whatever the common people had.

    "content": "Before and After the Liberation of Luohe\n    Mu Xin, Feng Mu\n    At the cost of only a little over a dozen light injuries, the People's Liberation Army liberated Luohe, a famous commercial center on the Pinghan Railway, the first inland river port in central Henan, with a population of 150,000, and a modernized city, in just two or three hours.\n\n    On the afternoon of the 18th of last month, our army, braving the bitter cold after the snow, pointed its spearhead at Yancheng. But just as the enemy was preparing to fight, a crack unit of our army unexpectedly and swiftly crossed the Ru River in secret, advancing in a roundabout way from the east and casting a dragnet over Luohe, five miles southeast of Yancheng. Late at night, the enemy guarding Yancheng was still staring wide-eyed waiting for battle; the enemy guarding Luohe still thought that disaster would not befall them and were peacefully playing mahjong. Meanwhile, the assault troops of the People's Liberation Army had already divided into several routes and went straight into the enemy's heart from the East Gate, the railway station, and the South Gate of Luohe. At this time, the enemy had not yet noticed, and a soldier came to the street to deliver a letter and was captured by our army. He was a prisoner of war who had been released by our army not long ago. After talking with him, he immediately led our army to the location of their troops. At this time, an enemy company commander came out to inspect the sentry post and was also captured by us. Our platoon leader, Li Zhihua, said to him: \"Go inside and blow the assembly whistle and tell them to come out and line up.\" The enemy company commander immediately went in and blew the whistle to form a line. More than 300 enemies were thus captured by our two squads without firing a single shot.\n\n    Before dawn, the East Gate, the railway station, the South Gate, and other places were occupied by our army without any casualties. At this time, the enemy in the inner city realized that the situation was not good, but it was already too late. Subsequently, our attacking troops poured into the inner city from the south and east. The defending enemy scattered like sheep, but none of them could escape the ever-shrinking dragnet. The three crack companies entrenched in the four courtyards, although trying to resist and struggle, were all crushed one by one. This city, twenty miles in circumference, was completely liberated under the bright sunshine of early morning. After detailed investigation, we only sacrificed two people and wounded eighteen, while the number of enemies captured was, according to incomplete statistics, more than 2,800.\n\n    This reporter drove into Luohe on the night of the 19th and was greeted by a long line of prisoners stretching from one street to another. Cars sped back and forth on the wide roads. The railway station was brightly lit, and the noise was a symphony of shouting and the sound of metal. Dozens of train carriages were parked there. The materials we seized were piled up like mountains, including hundreds of thousands of pairs of shoes and 150,000 pairs of American-made goggles. Groups of people were flocking to the railway station to collect rice and flour, including workers, small vendors, merchants, students, as well as wounded soldiers and officers abandoned by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.\n\n    Most of the city's 5,000 large and small shops have begun to operate, and the three theaters have also begun to perform. The streets and alleys are filled with crowds welcoming the People's Liberation Army. All kinds of declarations of the People's Liberation Army and the Outline Land Law are crowded with people reading them. No trace of war can be found.\n\n    People collecting grain in front of several large warehouses in the city are also coming and going in an endless stream. More than 40,000 poor people in the city who have no food or clothing are busy collecting relief grain. On Zhongshan Road, some disabled beggars each have piles of food and clothing given to them by passing PLA soldiers. A soldier gently covered a blind old woman with a bed quilt and put seized canned beef in her basket. Another soldier picked up the child beside her and put on him an oversized cotton coat… At the South Gate, the car of a certain general was stopped by several Chiang Kai-shek army officers who requested to join the People's Liberation Army, followed by a small businessman who also came over to request to join the army.\n\n    The enemy in Yancheng, five miles away across the Ru River, was shrinking back and not moving at this time. Although there were still a few sparse gunshots from time to time, the people of Luohe, under the protection of the People's Liberation Army, had begun to live new and happy days.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 漯河解放前后\n穆欣　冯牧\n1948-01-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　漯河解放前后\n    穆欣、冯牧\n    解放军以十余人轻伤的代价，在短短两三个钟头内解放了漯河。它是平汉路上著名的商业中心，豫中第一个水旱码头，拥有十五万人口，是一座近代化了的城市。\n    上月十八日下午我军冒着雪后的严寒，锋刃指向郾城。但正当敌人准备应战的时候，我某部精锐兵团却出敌意料的秘密和神速的渡过汝河，从东面迂回前进，给郾城东南五里的漯河撒下了天罗地网。深夜，郾城守敌还瞪着眼睛等待战斗；漯河守敌还以为厄运轮不到他们头上，安心的打着麻将。而解放军的突击部队已经分成几路从漯河的东关、车站及南关直入敌人的腹心。这时敌人尚未发觉，一个兵士到街上来送信，被我军捉住了。他是一个不久前才被我军释放的俘虏，接谈之后，立即带领我军到了他们部队的驻地。此时，一个敌军队长出来查哨也被我捉着了，我李之华排长对他说：“你到里面吹集合哨，叫他们出来站队”。敌军队长立刻进去吹哨站队，三百多敌人便胡胡涂涂的被我两班人不发一枪的俘虏了。\n    拂晓之前，东关、车站、南关等都被我军毫无伤亡的占领了。这时内城的敌人才发觉情况不好，然而已经晚了。随着，我攻击部队就从南面、东面涌进了内城。守敌象羊群般逃散，但一个也跑不出逐渐缩小的天罗地网。据守在四个院里的三个精锐连虽图抵抗挣扎，都被一一粉碎。这座方圆二十里的城市就在清早明朗的阳光下完全获得了解放。经过详细调查，我仅牺牲两人，受伤十八人，而俘虏敌人仅据不完全统计就有二千八百多人。\n    记者于十九日夜乘车驶进漯河，迎面碰见漫长的俘虏行列由这条街拖到另一条街。在宽阔的马路上，汽车穿梭的飞驰着。车站上灯火辉煌，喧嚷声与钢铁器响声交响成一片。数十列车箱停在那里。我缴获的物资堆积如山，鞋子有数十万双，美造风镜有十五万付。成群结队的人民，在涌向车站领米面。其中有工人、小贩商民、学生及被蒋匪遗弃的伤兵和军官。\n    市内五千家大小商店已大半开始营业，三家戏院也开始演唱。街头巷尾到处站满欢迎解放军的人群。解放军的各种宣言及土地法大纲前挤满了人在看。再找不到战争痕迹了。\n    城里几个大仓库前领粮的人也穿梭不绝。全市有四万多无衣无食的穷人都在忙着领救济粮。中山路上有些残废的乞丐，每个人面前也都堆满了过路解放军战士给他们的食品和衣物。一个战士把床棉被轻轻的盖在一个瞎子老太婆的身上，并把缴获的牛肉罐头放在她筐子里，另一个战士抱起她身旁的小孩，替他穿上一件又大又长的棉衣………。在南门口某将军乘坐的汽车被几个蒋军编余军官拦住，请求参加解放军，接着有一个小商人也过来，请求参军。\n    相距五里汝河对岸的郾城敌人，这时龟缩不动，虽时而还传来几声稀疏的炮声，但是漯河人民在人民解放军的拱卫下，已开始过着新的欢乐的日子。"

According to statistics, the value of smuggled goods seized by the Guangdong Customs in 1946 alone amounted to over 10 billion yuan. In the six months from May to October 1947, the value of seized smuggled goods had already exceeded 20 billion yuan. The market in Guangzhou is now flooded with smuggled goods. In addition to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and coastal waterways, smuggling routes also include air smuggling. Nanpeng Island, under the jurisdiction of Yangjiang County, and Dapeng Bay, under the jurisdiction of Bao'an County, are major bases for smuggling tungsten ore. It is said that smuggling tungsten ore from Guangzhou to Hong Kong can yield a profit of 100%. Large-scale smuggling is different from sporadic smuggling by those who make a living from it. In recent years, smuggling organizations in Guangdong, as is well known, are led by the bureaucratic capital groups of the Chiang government. They are all armed escorts, or they bribe customs officials, and they proceed by water, land, and air. For example, the \"tax-free sugar\" smuggled and imported by the Sino-American Industrial Company jointly run by Soong Mei-ling and Chennault a couple of months ago is already a public matter. Smuggling by the Executive Headquarters' ships is also an open secret. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit government's daily calls for \"strengthening anti-smuggling\" have no impact on these wealthy and powerful smuggling groups.

After each household assessed its assets, they actively organized production to make up for the losses. The poor and hired peasants raised the difficulty of production capital. The government provided loans of 50,000 yuan to ten poor peasant households and two extremely poor households, and lent one *shi* of grain. Geng Jinhai's wife said: \"When the enemy occupied the area, people suffered from cold and hunger, and the stubborn troops came to loot and arrest people indiscriminately. Our government provides loans and lends grain, fearing that we will suffer from cold and hunger during production. Everyone discussed that we should help each other in production.

The self-defense force and the old men open restaurants and make tofu, and three people organize a cart for transportation.\" Each woman contributes one *jin* of cotton as shares, organizes four spinning and weaving teams to set plans, and challenge each other.\n    Later, it was discovered that some middle peasants were unwilling to help each other in production, fearing losses. The root cause was found to be the unclear accounts from last year's mutual aid and substitute farming. Everyone suggested that middle and poor peasants are one family, and not to let anyone suffer losses for nothing, clearing the old accounts, people can invest as shareholders. Each share is 1,000 yuan, more shares more dividends, less shares less dividends. The middle peasants' ideological problems were resolved, and they started working with the poor peasants. The women's spinning and weaving movement is also going very well. There are currently seventeen spinning wheels, and fifteen *jin* have been spun in three days, averaging three *liang* per person per day, and ninety-five *jin* can be spun in a month.

Recently, upon hearing that the hired and poor peasants were about to rise up and completely turn things over, the landlord bullies resorted to conspiracies, threatening and utilizing their lackeys to establish a fake peasant association and undermine land reform. The landlord Zhang Shengui bribed the rogue Zhang Gougou to be the deputy village chief, and also ordered Zhang Hongniu, the landlord's family manager, to be the head of the peasant association. The landlord Zhang Ersheng pretended to be \"enlightened,\" giving Zhang Jinzi thirteen mu of land, telling him to be his lackey. The power in this village was completely controlled by the three major landlords. The fake \"Peasant Association\" praised the landlords, saying, \"The wealthy are doing good deeds, giving all their land to the masses.\" They also feigned sincerity, saying, \"Just leave a little bit for their family to live on.\"\n\n    Before the New Year, the work team arrived in the village. They discovered the landlord's trickery and ignored the fake \"Peasant Association,\" personally staying in the homes of poor peasants, eating and working with them. Starting from reminiscing about the past and discussing family assets, they guided more than ten poor and hired households to tell of the landlords' crimes. The poor peasants revealed that the landlord Zhang Jingyu and others had raped ×××'s wife in turns, and led the tying up and beating of three poor peasants. The landlord Zhang Sansheng refused to pay public grain and made the poor pay for him. The cowherd Feng Fasheng became ill while herding cows for his family and couldn't even drink a mouthful of rice soup. The villagers sent him a bowl of soup, but the landlord cursed, \"Is Fasheng your father? Why are you serving him?\" The work team used bitterness to evoke bitterness, and the suffering of the poor and hired was truly endless. An old woman with white hair grabbed Comrade Yang's sleeve and said, \"Brother! With you here, I have family! Look at my leg, I haven't been able to move for twenty years, it was injured by the landlord!...\" Many poor women, with tears in their eyes, urgently requested the Communist Party to lead them in abolishing the fake peasant association and completely turning things over.

In Fancun, eight mutual aid groups organized eleven carts to haul manure, earning a profit of 300,000 yuan in fourteen days, and there were also fifteen small carts engaged in transportation. Most of these people were middle peasants with carts, cattle, and capital. Poor peasants Xu Shuxiang, Fan Tongfang, Zhao Dongsheng, and others all said enviously: \"People have cattle, carts, and capital, so they can earn so much. We only have one share of cattle, no capital, and no carts, so we can't do anything.\" In Zhongshendi Village, there were ten carts hauling coal, fifteen small carts for transportation, and sideline occupations such as steamed bun shops, noodle shops, and tofu shops, most of which were also owned by middle-peasant households. Twenty poor peasant families were unable to engage in sideline occupations and were trapped at home. These facts show that the land reform in the past was not thorough, and the poor peasants had not completely turned themselves around. Therefore, solving the difficulties of poor peasants in engaging in sideline occupations became a major problem. Zhao Yanlin, the director of the Fancun Farmers' Association, actively visited various poor peasant families. When they raised difficulties such as lacking capital, carts, or harnesses, Zhao Yanlin immediately mobilized households with carts to pull together with households without carts, and borrowed money from middle peasant families for poor peasants, having already borrowed 75,000 yuan to give to the poor peasants. He also found harnesses for the poor peasants from neighboring villages. In order to support the poor peasants, the village cadres of Zhongshendi Village proposed selling the remaining fruits, wheat, trees, and copper coins in the village for money, which could be sold for 297,000 yuan, to be temporarily lent to the poor peasants.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 鸡泽是否有同样情形\n\n1948-01-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　鸡泽是否有同样情形\n    【本报冀南七日电】鸡泽过去土地改革不彻底，贫农搞副业有许多困难。范村有八个互助组组织了十一辆大车拉粪，十四天赚利三十万元，还有十五辆小车搞运输。这些人多半是有车有牛有本钱的中农。贫农徐书香、范同房、赵冬生等都眼红的说：“人家有牛有车有本钱，能赚那么多，咱只有一个牛股，又没本钱又没车，什么也不能干。”中申底村有十辆大车拉煤炭，十五辆小车运输，还有馒头坊、挂面坊、豆腐坊等副业，也多数是中农户。有二十家贫农无法搞副业，在家困着。这些事实说明过去土地改革不彻底，贫农还没翻透身，因此解决贫农搞副业的困难就成了大问题。范村农会主任赵言林积极访问各家贫农，当他们提出没本钱没车套等困难时，赵言林立即动员有车户与没车户伙拉，并往各中农家给贫农借钱，已借了七万五千元交给贫农。他又向邻村给贫农找车套。中申底村村干为扶助贫农，提出将村中果实尾巴麦子、树、铜钱卖成钱，可卖二十九万七千元，暂时贷给贫农。"

    "content": "“Should Not Have Brought Guns to Cheaply Buy a Printing Press”\n  　Ji'nan Daily Self-Criticism\n    [Ji'nan News] The Ji'nan Daily has made a public self-criticism regarding the cheap purchase of a printing press in Shijiazhuang. The self-criticism first described the circumstances of the cheap purchase of the printing press (completely consistent with what was published in this newspaper on the 6th of this month). It then stated that the Propaganda Department of the Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu Central Bureau believed that this matter was \"grabbing a handful\" in a newly liberated city, harming the people, and harming industrial and commercial interests. It immediately sent a telegram to the District Party Committee, instructing us to conduct a strict examination of this matter. After our self-examination, it was indeed as the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau pointed out: it was \"grabbing a handful\" in a newly liberated city, only caring about ourselves, harming the people, and harming industrial and commercial interests. After Shimen was liberated, we sent three purchasing agents to buy lead type, wanting to take advantage of \"cheap\" prices. We didn't realize that this kind of \"cheap\" price arose from the newly liberated merchants having been deceived by enemy propaganda in the past and not understanding us. Taking advantage of their \"cheap\" prices is harming the interests of the people. We originally intended to only buy lead type, but because it was not sold separately, we bought the machines and other items together. We didn't realize that doing so violated our Party's policy of protecting national industry and commerce and promoting the prosperity of the city. Our starting point was a simple \"small-group interest.\" The ideological root of this starting point is, on the one hand, the remnants of the erroneous thinking from the guerrilla war period of treating large cities as colonies and grabbing a handful; and on the other hand, the consistent opposition of the interests of the organization to the interests of the masses, only caring about the organization and not caring about the masses, making the masses obey the organization, and acting independently from the overall interests of the people and the Party's policies. These are also reflections of a kind of exploitative and sectarian thinking in our specific work. In addition, in the thinking and attitude of our purchasing agents, they were also wielding the so-called \"official\" prestige, not caring whether others truly wanted to sell or not, feeling happy as long as they got it into their own hands. Furthermore, because they were wearing military uniforms and carrying guns, they went to buy it twice, which further increased Chang Zhanggui's panic and suspicion, and fueled his idea of selling at a cheap price. We completely accept the education and criticism of us from the New Shimen Daily and the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Electric\n\n　　The CCP Northwest Bureau recently convened a conference of senior party cadres from the entire region in a certain area of northern Shaanxi, lasting nearly a month, to report and discuss the major issues of how to complete land reform in the border region. On the opening day of the conference, Comrade Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau, Comrade Lin Boqu, Chairman of the Border Government, and Comrade He Long, Commander of the Northwest Joint Defense Army, delivered important speeches respectively. After analyzing the current new situation in the Great Northwest, they emphasized that this conference should review the Northwest Bureau's past policies, guidelines, and cadres' ideology, work style, and class stand under the guiding ideology of wholeheartedly serving the people and being a long-term worker for the laboring working class and peasant masses, so that we can be more powerful and healthier to meet the new situation of liberating the Great Northwest. Comrade Xi Zhongxun made a preliminary comprehensive review of the errors and shortcomings exposed in various aspects since the border region's self-defense war. He reviewed that the Northwest Bureau in the past did not resolutely rely on poor and lower-middle peasants to mobilize the masses in solving the land problem, and did not pay attention to examining and criticizing the ideological stand of cadres at all levels, and timely prevent the attack of landlord ideas. Among some cadres at the border region and district levels, there had been a tendency of ideological degeneration and some serious confused ideas or blind complacency. He reviewed that his attitude towards these phenomena was guilty of liberalism and bureaucracy, and pointed out that the conference's policy was to let go and promote democracy, use the method of class analysis to conduct criticism and self-criticism from top to bottom and from bottom to top of all past work, in order to achieve the purpose of clarifying thinking and rectifying the organization. Chairman Lin's report has preliminarily reviewed that the border region government lacked a sufficient mass perspective in implementing the Three-Thirds System policy and in the work of education, justice, finance and other aspects. He also criticized himself for overemphasizing the history of certain local old cadres, which led to liberalism towards the shortcomings and errors of the former Director of the Finance Department, Huo Weide, such as extravagant living, wasting public funds, and being divorced from the masses. Commander He sharply criticized the serious mistakes made by individual senior cadres in seeking independence from the Party. He severely condemned certain army cadres for protecting landlords, resisting land reform, oppressing laboring peasants, and violating government laws, which were intolerable principled errors. In the future, warlordism should be completely eradicated, and the troops should be trained into a people's army that truly obeys the Party and the interests of the revolution. Such serious criticisms from Xi, Lin, and He became the force that encouraged the conference to launch self-criticism, and were warmly responded to by the entire audience of party members. In group discussions, the conference deeply explored problems, carried out serious ideological struggles against errors, and after discussing the Land Law Outline item by item based on Comrade Li Zhuoran's report on the National Land Conference and the Land Law Outline, it then moved on to the conference discussion. Major cadres all made separate reviews of their work, and the speeches of Comrades Jia Tuofu, Wang Weizhou, and Li Hebang were given importance by the conference. Jia Tuofu reviewed that the department he was in charge of made wrong business decisions without the approval of the Party and government's senior leading organs, resulting in huge losses to the border region's financial finance and military and civilian economy, which was a principled error of seeking independence from the Party. He further reviewed that the root cause of the errors and deviations that occurred in his work within two years of his tenure was the stand of petty-bourgeois individualism and the subjective ideology, as well as bureaucracy and liberalism in his work style. However, Gao Feng, former Secretary of the Sanbian Prefectural Committee, Wu Zhiyuan, Commissioner, Tang Hongcheng, Deputy Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Border Government, and Zhou Xing, Director of the Security Office of the Border Region, etc., did not deeply review their mistakes. Under the request of the conference and the influence of the conference spirit, they are prepared to continue to make further reviews. Wu Daifeng, Commander of the Suide District Garrison Command, twice reviewed the serious crimes of his subordinates in undermining government laws, infringing on the interests of the people, arbitrarily beating and scolding the masses, hindering land reform, accepting bribes to privately release reactionary landlords from the country, and stealing the fruits of mass struggle, which were extremely vague, arousing dissatisfaction from the entire audience, who unanimously demanded his removal from office, which was agreed to by the presidium of the conference (he has expressed after the conference that he will resolutely correct his mistakes). Some party members and cadres who were originally not at ease in their work were inspired by the spirit of the conference and felt that their past ideological consciousness dominated by personal plans was extremely wrong and felt secretly ashamed. After the conference discussion, Comrade Xi Zhongxun made a summary report. He made a clear analysis and estimation of the past work in various aspects of the border region, and also put forward specific plans on how to implement the Land Law Outline in the future. Then, Comrade Ma Wenrui, Minister of the Organization Department of the Northwest Bureau, announced to the conference the decision of the Northwest Bureau on the punishment of nine party member cadres, which was unanimously approved by the conference. Comrade He Long made important comments on issues such as policy changes, mass viewpoints, mobilizing the masses, and ideological struggle within the Party, which were raised in the conference discussion. Finally, Chairman Lin delivered a closing speech. He said that this conference was the most successful and historically significant meeting since the Border Region High-Level Cadre Meeting in 1942. He called on everyone to open their minds, put down their burdens, and honestly be the people's servants under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. He encouraged everyone to pack their bags and go to the countryside to implement the spirit of this conference, thoroughly complete the land reform in the border region, and strive to organize peasant production to better support the front.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中共西北局召开高干会　批判错误整顿组织  撤换障碍土地改革的坏干部　发展批评自我批评  搞通思想整顿组织\n\n1948-01-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中共西北局召开高干会\n  　批判错误整顿组织\n    撤换障碍土地改革的坏干部\n  　发展批评自我批评\n    搞通思想整顿组织\n    【新华社西北电】中共中央西北局近于陕北某地召开全区高级党员干部大会，历时近月，报告和讨论如何完成边区土地改革的重大问题。大会开幕日由西北局书记习仲勋同志、边府主席林柏渠同志、西北联防军司令员贺龙同志分别作重要发言。他们于分析目前大西北新形势后，强调说明这次大会要在全心全意为人民服务、替劳苦工农群众当长工的指导思想下，检讨过去西北局的政策方针，及干部的思想作风与阶级立场，使我们更加有力，更加健康来迎接解放大西北的新局面。习仲勋同志对边区自卫战争以来各方面所暴露的错误和缺点，作了初步的全面检讨。他检讨西北局过去解决土地问题没有坚决依靠贫雇农，放手发动群众，没有注意审查和批评各级干部的思想立场，并及时防止地主思想影响的袭击。在边区及分区一级若干干部中，曾经发生思想意识堕落及某些严重的糊涂观念或盲目自满的倾向。他检讨自己对这些现象的态度犯了自由主义与官僚主义的毛病，指出大会方针是放手发扬民主，用阶级的分析的方法，对过去一切工作进行从上而下与从下而上的批评与自我批评，以达到搞通思想和整顿组织的目的。林主席的报告已初步检讨了边区政府在执行三三制政策及教育司法财经等工作中，都缺乏充分的群众观点。他并批评自己过分看重某些地方老干部的历史，以致于对前财政厅长霍维德生活铺张，浪费公费，脱离群众等缺点和错误犯了自由主义。贺司令员尖锐批评个别高级干部对党闹独立性所犯的重大错误。他严厉指责某些军队干部包庇地主，违抗土地改革，欺压劳苦农民，破坏政府法令的不能容忍的原则性错误。今后应彻底铲除军阀主义，把部队练成真正服从党与革命利益的人民军队。习、林、贺这种严肃的批评成为鼓舞大会展开自我批评的力量，而受到全场党员的热烈响应。大会在分组讨论中深入发掘问题，对错误进行严肃的思想斗争，并根据李卓然同志关于全国土地会议及土地法大纲的传达，逐条讨论土地法大纲后，继即转入大会讨论。各主要干部均分别对自己的工作进行检讨，贾拓夫、王维舟及李合邦等同志的发言，受到大会的重视。贾拓夫检讨该部门未经党政高级领导机关批准，擅自决定错误的业务方针，招致边区财政金融与军民经济的巨大损失，是对党闹独立性的原则性错误。他进而检讨自己任职两年内，在工作中所发生的错误和偏向的根源，是小资产阶级个人主义的立场和主观主义的思想方法，以及作风上的官僚主义与自由主义。但前三边地委书记高峰、专员吴志渊、边府民厅副厅长唐洪澄及边区保安处处长周兴等对错误检讨均不深刻，他们在大会要求与大会精神影响之下，准备继续作进一步的检讨。绥德分区警备司令部吴岱峰对其部属破坏政府法令，侵犯人民利益，任意打骂群众，阻碍土地改革，受贿私放反动地主出境，并窃取群众斗争果实等严重罪过的两次反省，均极含糊，引起全场不满，一致要求将其撤职，得到大会主席团的同意（大会后彼已表示要坚决改正自己错误的态度）。若干原来不安心工作的党员、干部受到大会精神的感召，认为过去以个人打算为主的思想意识，极为错误而暗自愧悔。大会讨论后，由习仲勋同志作总结性报告，他对边区过去各方面的工作作了明确的分析和估计，对今后如何贯彻土地法大纲亦提出了具体方案。接着西北局组织部长马文瑞同志向大会宣布了西北局关于处分九个党员干部的决定，得到了大会一致的通过。贺龙同志针对大会讨论中所提出的政策转变、群众观点、发动群众及党内思想斗争等问题发表重要意见。最后林主席致闭幕词，他说这次大会是一九四二年边区高干会后第一次最成功最有历史意义的会议，他号召大家在毛泽东思想指导下，打开脑筋，放下包袱，老老实实地当人民的勤务员。勉励大家背起行李下乡去贯彻这次会议的精神，彻底完成边区的土地改革，努力组织农民生产，更好的支援前线。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-14",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Comrades:\n\n　　Last Double Tenth Festival, our Party Central Committee promulgated the \"Outline Land Law of China.\" From October to December, the Central Bureau convened a regional land conference, conducted strict criticism and self-criticism, resolutely opposed landlord-rich peasant ideology, rogue ideology, and Westernized forgetful ideology. Everyone unanimously supported and prepared to resolutely implement the \"Outline Land Law of China.\" In the upcoming regional land reform review and thorough land distribution movement, we must rely on the poor peasants, consolidate the alliance with the middle peasants, eliminate feudal and semi-feudal exploitative land systems, and meet the demands of landless and land-poor peasants. We must ensure that everyone has land to cultivate, a house to live in, food to eat, and clothes to wear, so that the vast number of poor peasants can completely turn themselves over and become masters of their own destiny. We Communist Party members should resolutely implement the \"Outline Land Law of China,\" consult with peasants on all matters, carefully study thorough land distribution methods with them, and lead all peasants to implement this outline and achieve the complete liberation of the peasants.\n\n　　Our border region's land reform movement has been underway for more than two years. Some areas have done a relatively thorough job, and many Communist Party members have shown exemplary performance in the land reform movement, being brave in struggle and yielding in the distribution of fruits, not taking any advantage, and sharing equally with the masses. In leading the struggle, they proceeded from the perspective of the poor and hired peasants, took care of their interests, consolidated the alliance with the middle peasants, consulted with the masses on all matters, followed the mass line, and did not act until the masses had fully discussed and prepared; they did not force or command, and were able to patiently persuade those few who acted extremely and disregarded the overall situation, without tailism. They honestly served the people as farmhands, without taking credit or being proud, and they served as farmhands very well. They maintained close contact with the masses from beginning to end, and the masses cherished them very much. However, many areas have not been thoroughly reformed, and some are even very far from thorough. Even in areas where land reform has been relatively thorough, there are still problems with unfair distribution of land and property. For example, Party members from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds protect their families and relatives; leading organs, troops, and organizations listen to the one-sided words of landlords and rich peasants, are fooled by them, and become \"air-raid shelters\" for landlords and rich peasants. Some Party members are selfish and self-interested in land reform, distributing more fruits to themselves, even forcibly occupying and stealing the fruits of the masses, distributing land, houses, clothes, livestock, furniture, etc., that are plentiful and good. In particular, many Party members have very bad work styles, standing on the heads of the people, acting as overlords, not obeying the opinions of the majority of the masses, forcing orders, acting arbitrarily, completely in the style of Kuomintang masters, opening up thinking by “the cadres beat and the masses are persuaded”, mutually covering up, “you defend me, I support you.” Many bad Party members and bad cadres have become anti-people small cliques, \"a hornet's nest, untouchable,\" opposing the poor and hired, becoming enemies of the people, alienating themselves from the masses, and the people are very dissatisfied with them. The land, houses, clothes, livestock, furniture, etc., distributed to the poor and hired are few and bad, and some poor and hired people still have no land to cultivate, no houses to live in, and no clothes to wear, and have no say in the countryside, let alone working in the government or farmers' associations. In the past, the poor and hired were exploited by the landlord class, but today they are oppressed by this part of bad Party members and bad cadres. With the Party so impure and these bad Party members and bad cadres pressing down on the peasants, how can the poor and hired be completely liberated? How can the unity of the middle peasants be consolidated? How can feudalism be completely eliminated? How can land be thoroughly distributed equally? In the upcoming movement to review land reform and distribute land equally, all Communist Party members who have committed the above errors should admit their mistakes to the masses, accept the criticism of the masses, and must correct them in action. The bad Party members and bad cadres in the countryside should be distinguished according to their class nature. Some are landlord elements, rich peasant elements, and rogue elements who have taken the opportunity to infiltrate the Party. These are disguised opportunists and should have their Party membership suspended, investigated, and those who should be expelled should be expelled, and those who should be punished should be punished, without any leniency. Some are Party members and cadres from peasant backgrounds, and their mistakes are also different. Some are selfish and self-interested, obtaining more fruits, or even becoming corrupt and degenerating, forgetting their roots. Those who have forgotten their roots must return the fruits they have over-occupied, correct their mistakes, and be subject to the criticism and punishment of the masses. Some are forcing orders and alienating themselves from the masses in order to complete work tasks. This is making mistakes for the public good. Due to our leadership's bureaucracy, there was no education beforehand and a lack of inspection afterward. We should share the responsibility for their mistakes, but bad work styles should also be corrected. We call on all Party members and cadres who have made mistakes to stand on the position of the Party and the people, sincerely accept criticism, accept punishment, resolutely correct their mistakes, and implement the task of equal land distribution. As long as you admit your mistakes to the masses, return the fruits, bow your heads to the people, and declare that you will obey the people and obey the Party from now on, the people and the Party will still want you, and will treat you warmly, help you correct your mistakes, and continue to serve the people as farmhands. You must not be incited by the landlords and rich peasants to stand on their position and oppose your own brothers, causing internal disunity, which will be very unfavorable to you. Therefore, the Central Bureau reiterates the decision of last May that all Party members should be open to the public and be reviewed and evaluated by the masses. Every Party member should bravely accept the review and evaluation of the masses, and should especially humbly accept the opinions and criticisms of the poor and hired masses. All Party members and cadres who have distributed more or forcibly occupied the fruits of struggle of the masses should unconditionally and quickly return all of them to the masses, and cannot destroy or waste them because they want to return them to the masses. If they destroy or waste them, they will be severely punished. Rectifying the Party ranks is to better serve the people and to ensure that the task of thoroughly distributing land equally can be smoothly completed and that the poor and hired can be completely liberated.\n\n　　In the upcoming movement to implement the review of land reform and equal land distribution, the Central Bureau calls on every Party member to: (1) resolutely implement the \"Outline Land Law,\" and must not have any words or actions that violate the \"Outline Land Law\"; (2) obey all resolutions and policies of the Party, and must not disobey or make independent moves against the Party; (3) obey all resolutions of the poor peasant leagues, farmers' associations, and peasant representative conferences, and must not disobey, and must wholeheartedly serve the people as farmhands, and must not make independent moves against the masses; (4) when distributing land and property equally, Party members must not distribute more or forcibly occupy; (5) Party members must not protect their own families and relatives, and must not protect the families of soldiers, cadres, and martyrs. Party members who commit crimes should be handed over to the people's court for trial, and leading organs at all levels must not protect them because they are Party members; (6) cherish the fruits of the land struggle, cherish public property, and must not have any destructive or wasteful behavior; (7) the whole Party must unite, unite the peasants, and contact the masses, and must not take any retaliatory actions against the peasants, must not provoke internal unity among the peasants, stir up trouble, and must not participate in the internal sectarian struggles of the peasants; (8) firmly rely on the poor peasants, consolidate the alliance with the middle peasants, consult with the masses on all matters, follow the mass line, and must not be passive and laissez-faire, force orders, or substitute for them; (9) promote the \"Outline Land Law,\" and must not take a liberal attitude; (10) be honest and truthful, seek truth from facts, and must not make false reports, false instructions, be double-dealing, or take a two-faced attitude. Anyone who violates the above ten regulations will be severely punished by the Party and will be judged by the people.\n\n　　Comrades! Our Communist Party is the party of the proletariat, and every Party member must serve the people wholeheartedly at all times, and serve as farmhands for the people. Our Party members must be with the peasants and lead them in carrying out land reform, and every Party member must be a good farmhand in this movement. If you have not been a good farmhand in the past, you must work hard in the future and be a good farmhand.\n\nJanuary 10, 1948\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中国共产党晋冀鲁豫中央局　告全体党员书\n\n1948-01-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中国共产党晋冀鲁豫中央局\n  　告全体党员书同志们：\n    去年双十节，我党中央颁布了中国土地法大纲。十月到十二月中央局召开了全区土地会议，进行了严格的批评和自我批评，坚决反对了地主富农思想、流氓思想和洋化忘本思想，全体一致衷心拥护并准备坚决执行中国土地法大纲。在将开始的全区复查土地改革、彻底平分土地的运动中，我们要依靠贫农，巩固的联合中农，消灭封建性及半封建性剥削的土地制度，满足无地少地农民的要求。做到人人有地种、有房住、有饭吃、有衣穿，使广大贫苦农民彻底翻身，起来当家作主。我们共产党员应坚决执行中国土地法大纲，遇事与农民商量，好好的与农民研究彻底平分土地办法，领导全体农民起来实现这个大纲，达到农民的彻底翻身。\n    我们边区土地改革运动，已经进行了两年多。有些地区做的比较彻底，不少共产党员在土地改革运动中表现很模范，做到斗争英勇在前，分果实礼让在后，不占分毫便宜，与群众分得一样。在领导斗争中做到从贫雇出发，照顾贫雇利益，巩固的联合中农，遇事与群众商量，走群众路线，群众不酝酿成熟不自己行动；他们不强迫命令，对少数人不顾大体的偏激行为，他们能耐心说服，不尾巴主义。他们老老实实为人民当长工，不居功，不骄傲，他们当长工当得很好。他们与群众自始至终密切连系，群众十分爱护他们。但不少地区还搞得不彻底，甚至还很不彻底。即土地改革进行得比较彻底的地区，也还有土地财物分得不公道的弊病。譬如：地主富农出身的党员，包庇自己的家庭及亲友；领导机关部队和团体听了地主富农片面之词，上了地主富农的当，当了地主富农的“防空洞”。有的党员在土地改革中，自私自利，多分果实，甚至强占窃取了群众的果实，分的土地、房屋、衣服、牲口、家具等又多又好。特别有不少党员作风十分不好，站在人民头上，作威作福，不服从群众多数的意见，强迫命令，独断独行，完全是国民党老爷作风，打通思想，是“干部打，群众通”，互相包庇，“你拥我的护，我撑你的腰”。不少坏党员坏干部已成为反人民的小集团，“一窝蜂，动不得”，与负雇作对，与人民为敌，脱离群众，人民对他们很不满意。贫雇分的土地、房屋、衣服、牲口、家具等又少又坏，甚至有的贫雇，直到今天还没有地种，没有房子住，没有衣服穿，在农村中没有发言权，更谈不到政府、农会里办事。过去贫雇受地主阶级的剥削，今天则受这一部分坏党员坏干部的压迫。党内这样不纯洁，有了这些坏党员坏干部压在农民头上，贫雇怎能彻底翻身？中农怎能巩固团结？封建怎能彻底消灭？土地怎能彻底平分？在今后复查土地改革、平分土地的运动中，所有犯了上述错误的共产党员，都应该向群众承认错误，接受群众的批评，且必须在行动中切实纠正。农村中的坏党员坏干部，从其阶级本质上看，应该加以区别，有的是地主分子、富农分子、流氓分子乘机钻进党内来的，这是伪装的投机分子，应一律停止党籍，进行审查，该开除的开除，该处分的处分，决不准稍有姑息。有的是农民出身的党员和干部，他们的错误亦有所不同。其中有些是自私自利，多得果实，甚或贪污蜕化，忘了本。这些忘了本的分子，多占果实必须退出，所犯错误必须纠正，一任群众批评发落。其中有些则是为了完成工作任务而强迫命令脱离群众，这是为公而犯了错误，由于我们领导上的官僚主义，事前没有教育，事后缺乏检查，他们犯了错误，我们应该分担责任，但不好的作风亦应纠正。我们号召所有犯错误的党员和干部，站在党和人民的立场上，诚恳的接受批评，接受处分，坚决改正错误，贯彻平分土地的任务。只要你们向群众承认错误，退还果实，向人民低头，声明今后服从人民服从党，人民和党还是要你们的，并热情相待，帮助你们改正错误，继续为人民当长工。你们决不要受地主富农的挑拨离间，站在地主富农的立场上，去反对自己的弟兄，使内部不团结，那将对你们是十分不利的。因此，中央局再重申去年五月决定，党员一律公开，由群众来审查鉴定。每个党员应该勇敢的来接受群众的审查鉴定，特别应该虚心接受贫雇群众的意见和批评。所有党员和干部多分或强占群众的斗争果实，应无条件的迅速的全部退还群众，不能因为要退还群众就破坏浪费，如果破坏浪费，要受到严厉处分。把党的队伍整顿好，是为着更好的为人民服务，使彻底平分土地任务能顺利完成，使贫雇能彻底翻身。\n    在今后贯彻复查土地改革平分土地运动中，中央局号召每个党员要做到：（一）坚决执行土地法大纲，不得有任何违反土地法大纲的言论和行动；（二）要服从党的一切决议和政策，不得违抗，不得向党闹独立性；（三）要服从贫农团、农会及农代会的一切决议，不得违抗，要全心全意为人民当长工，不得向群众闹独立性；（四）在平分土地财物时，党员不得多分或强占；（五）党员不得包庇本家本姓及其亲友，不得包庇军干烈属，党员犯罪应交人民法庭审判，各级领导机关不得因系党员加以包庇；（六）要爱惜土地斗争果实，爱惜公产公物，不得有任何破坏浪费行为；（七）全党团结，团结农民，联系群众，不得对农民采取任何报复行为，不得挑拨农民内部团结，招是惹非，不得参加农民内部宗派斗争；（八）要紧紧依靠贫农，巩固的联合中农，凡事要与群众商量，走群众路线，不得消极放任，强迫命令或代替包办；（九）要宣传土地法大纲，不得抱自由主义态度；（十）要忠诚老实，实事求是，不得作假报告，假指示，阳奉阴违，两面态度。谁要违犯以上十项规定，就要受到党的严厉制裁，就要受到人民的裁判。\n    同志们！我们共产党是无产阶级的政党，每个党员要时时刻刻全心全意为人民服务，给人民当长工。我们党员要同农民在一道并领导农民进行土地改革，每个党员在此次运动中一定要当一个好长工。过去没当好，今后要努力，一定要当好。\n  　　　　　　　　　一九四八年一月十日"

    "title": "From This Week, the Democratic Anti-Imperialist Camp Will Achieve Greater Victory This Year",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-14",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. International Week – January 5th – 11th.\n\n　　This week's international news foreshadows that the coming year will be a year in which the democratic anti-imperialist camp will achieve greater victories in various parts of the world, especially in the Far East and Western Europe.\n\n　　The revolutionary teacher of the Chinese people—Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's report \"On the Current Situation and Our Tasks\" is currently spreading around the world. This report summarizes the great experience of China's victorious war of self-defense and land reform over the past year or so. It not only indicates clear goals for the people of the whole country, but also has great guiding and inspiring effects on the entire East and the world. In the future, the national liberation movements in the Eastern colonies will move towards a path of victory under the guidance of this great document. American imperialism and its running dogs have been alarmed by this. The most reactionary Howard newspaper exclaimed that this report is \"more significant\" than the establishment of the Greek democratic government and Wallace's independent participation in the presidential election.\n\n　　In Eastern European countries such as South, Czech and Poland, last year's production plans have been completed, and they are organizing forces to strive for greater achievements in political and economic aspects this year. Romania abandoned the monarchy before the new year and announced the official establishment of the People's Democratic Republic. This is another brilliant achievement of the new democratic revolution of the 16 million Romanian people. In Bulgaria, the Fatherland Front published a new draft charter, defining the Fatherland Front as a single political organization and transforming it into a broad democratic anti-imperialist united front led by the working class. This is a major event and a reliable guarantee for Bulgaria's transition to a socialist society. The above three points show that the people of Eastern Europe are preparing various conditions in order to embark on the most happy socialist society of mankind.\n\n　　In the past week, the people of the whole of Germany have been swept into a wave of \"struggle for the democratic unification of Germany.\" People's congresses have been held in various states, counties and even villages in the Soviet-occupied zone. In the western American, British and French occupied zones, the German Communist Party is launching a heroic struggle to organize the \"Democratic National Front.\" The People's Congress of Western Germany is also actively preparing. Regardless of the obstruction and sabotage of the occupying authorities and their running dogs such as Schumacher, this struggle for German democratic unification has still won the widespread support of lower-level workers and party members of the Social Democratic Party and other working people. This movement will undoubtedly make the American and British imperialist reactionary activities of splitting Germany and organizing the \"West German government\" completely isolated among the German people, and ultimately lead to failure.\n\n　　The democratic struggle in Europe maintains an even more magnificent scale in Italy. The Italian Communist Party held its Sixth National Congress on the 5th. This is another major event following the establishment of the Italian People's Democratic Front on December 28th last year. This marks a new upsurge in the Italian democratic anti-imperialist movement. The Italian People's Democratic Front has accepted the experiences and lessons of the People's Fronts in France, Spain, and Yugoslavia in the past. Now it is not a union between the leading organs of various political parties, but a mass organization that unites Italian workers, peasants, intellectuals, and other democratic patriots. It is a new form of unity and common struggle of democratic forces. It is led by the consistent actions of the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party, and based on the close unity of workers and peasants. This provides the necessary guarantee for the victory of the Italian people's movement for independence, democracy and freedom. In this situation, the Sixth National Congress of the Italian Communist Party is undoubtedly a meeting to prepare for victory. Togliatti, in his report to the congress, declared with confidence in victory: \"All our goals will be achieved by legal means, but if our enemies want to use force, we are prepared to deal with them in the same way.\"\n\n　　At the same time, a new wave of strikes has swept across Italy. On the 5th and 6th, the local garrison troops in major cities across the country went on strike and held demonstrations to protest the chaotic order to postpone demobilization. Bloody clashes occurred everywhere. Currently, there are hundreds of thousands of strikers, and the trend continues to expand.\n\n　　A new struggle of the French working class is also brewing. The activities of American imperialism and the French Socialist Party traitors to split the General Confederation of Labor have further promoted the unity of the French working class. The vast majority of trade union organizations remain loyal to the General Confederation of Labor, and the number of new workers joining the General Confederation of Labor is constantly increasing. In response to a series of reactionary measures taken by the French-American authorities in the new year (huge military budget, increased taxes, increased prices, French-American traitorous agreement, etc.), the General Confederation of Labor issued a call on the 7th, demanding that the working class prepare to fight for new wage rates. The General Confederation of Agriculture and small and medium-sized manufacturers also participated in the struggle against the new tax. On the 5th, there was a demonstration of 20,000 film workers in Paris, and on the 6th, many shops in the Paris area announced a strike. On the 7th, small businessmen in Paris also held a mass rally to protest the French government's reactionary tax law. These events foreshadow that a new storm is coming.\n\n　　Around the New Year, the British working class also launched a struggle against the Labor Party authorities' splitting of the workers' movement and clamoring against communism. The advanced section of the British working class responded to Philip's anti-communist statement on December 22nd last year and Attlee's anti-communist and anti-Soviet speech on the 3rd of this month with widespread and fierce protest movements. Anti-protest meetings were held in trade unions everywhere, expressing their trust in the leadership of the British Communist Party in trade unions. The five British Communist Party executive committee members of the South Wales Executive Committee of the National Union of Mineworkers were re-elected under the Labor Party's instigation of re-election. As a result of the re-election of the Transport and General Workers' Union, on which Bevan relied to build his career, the British Communist Party won many important positions. For example, British Communist Party member Jones was elected as the chairman of the London First District Passenger Transport Committee (65,000 members) and the Central Bus Committee (36,000 members). On the 5th, when the British Communist Party's Workers' Daily celebrated its 18th anniversary, the number of worker representatives participating in the grand ceremony reached 60,000. Obviously, the advanced section of the British working class is breaking away from the influence of the Labor Party's reactionary authorities and turning to support the leadership of the British Communist Party, the true representative of its own class.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 从这一周看今年民主反帝阵营将获更大胜利\n\n1948-01-14\n第2版()\n专栏：国际一周\n\n　　从这一周看今年\n  　民主反帝阵营将获更大胜利\n    【新华社陕北十二日电】国际一周——一月五日——十一日。\n    这一周的国际新闻，预告着今后的一年，将是民主反帝阵营在世界各地，尤其是远东与西欧，取得更大胜利的一年。\n    中国人民的革命导师——中共中央毛主席的“论目前形势和我们的任务”报告，目前在世界各地传播着。这报告总结了中国一年多来胜利的自卫战争与土地改革的伟大经验，不但向全国人民指示了明确的奋斗目标，而且对全东方全世界都有极大的指导与鼓舞作用。今后，东方各殖民地民族解放运动将在这伟大文件照耀下，走向胜利的坦途。美国帝国主义及其走狗们已对此惊慌失措。最反动的霍华德系报纸，就惊呼说：这一报告，比之希腊民主政府的成立和华莱士独立参加总统竞选，“意义更为重大”。\n    在东欧南、捷、波等国都完成了去年的生产计划，并正组织力量，为争取今年政治经济方面的更大成就而斗争。罗马尼亚在年前废弃了君主皇朝，宣布了人民民主共和国的正式建立，这是一千六百万罗国人民新民主革命的另一辉煌成就。在保加利亚，祖国阵线发表了新的章程草案，确定祖国阵线为单一的政治组织，把它变成为以工人阶级为领导的广泛的民主反帝统一战线，这是一件大事，是保国过渡到社会主义的可靠保证。上述三项，显示：东欧人民正在准备各种条件，以便走上人类最幸福的社会主义社会。\n    一周来全德人民卷入了“为德国的民主统一而斗争”的浪潮。苏占领区各州，各县甚至各村均已召开了人民代表大会。西部美英法占领区内，德国共产党正在为组织“民主民族阵线”而展开了英勇的斗争。西部德国的人民代表大会也在积极筹备中，不管占领当局及其走狗舒马赫之流的阻难与破坏，这一为德国民主统一的斗争，仍取得了社会民主党下层工人党员及其他劳动人民的广泛支持。这一运动无疑将使美英帝国主义分裂德国，组织“西德政府”的反动活动，在德国人民中完全陷于孤立，并最后引向失败。\n    欧洲的民主斗争，在意大利保持着更其雄伟的规模。意共在五日召开了六次全国代表大会，这是继去年十二月二十八日意国人民民主阵线成立大会后的另一重大事件，这标志着意国民主反帝运动的新高潮。意国的人民民主阵线，接受了过去法国、西班牙及南斯拉夫等国人民阵线的经验教训，现在已不是各政党领导机关之间的联合，而是团结了意国工人、农民、知识分子及其他民主的爱国分子的群众组织，是民主势力团结与共同斗争的新形式，它以意共与社会党的行动一致为领导，而以工人与农民的亲密团结为基础，这就使争取独立、民主和自由的意国人民运动之走向胜利，有了必要的保证。在这种情形下，意共的六大，无疑是一个准备走向胜利的大会。托格里亚蒂在大会的报告中，充满着胜利的信心宣称：“我们的一切目的，将以合法手段达成，但如我们的敌人要用武力，我们就准备采用敌人的办法来对付它。”\n    与此同时，新的罢工浪潮又已席卷意大利全国。五、六两日全国各大城市的地方守备部队，爆发罢勤并举行示威，抗议延期复员的乱命。流血冲突到处发生。目前罢工者已达数十万人之众，并有继续扩大之势。\n    法国工人阶级的新的斗争亦在酝酿中。美帝国主义与法国社会党叛徒分裂总工会的活动，更促进了法国工人阶级的团结。绝大多数的工会组织仍忠实于总工会，而新的加入总工会的工人数目正不断增加中。针对着法美当局新年来一连串的反动措施（庞大的军事预算，增加税收，提高物价，法美卖国协定等），总工会于七日已发出号召，要求工人阶级为争取新工资率而准备斗争，总农会与中小厂商亦参加了反对新税收的斗争，五日巴黎有两万电影从业员的示威，六日巴黎区很多商店宣告罢市，七日巴黎小商人并举行群众大会，抗议法国政府反动的税收法。这些事件，预示了新的暴风雨即将来临。\n    英国工人阶级在新年前后，亦展开了反对工党当局分裂工人运动及叫嚣反共的斗争。对于菲力浦去年十二月二十二日的反共声明，及本月三日艾德礼的反共反苏演说，英国工人阶级的先进部分，报之以广泛的激烈的抗议运动。各地工会中纷纷举行抗议会议，并表示信任英共在职工会的领导。全国矿工联盟南威尔士执委会五位英共执委，在工党挑拨复选下仍再度当选。贝文赖以起家的运输业及各业工人工会改选结果，英共反而赢得了许多重要职位，如英共党员宙恩斯被选为伦敦第一区客运委员会（会员六万五千人）及公共汽车中央委员会（会员三万六千人）的主席。五日英共工人日报十八周年纪念时，参加盛典的工人代表，数达六万人。显然英国工人阶级的先进部分，正在摆脱工党反动当局的影响，而转向于拥护自己阶级的真正代表英共的领导了。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Electric Dispatch: Zhang Sheng-san, the former Director of the Agriculture and Forestry Department of the Hebei-Central Hebei Administrative Office, a landlord element who infiltrated the Party, stole important positions, and consistently resisted land reform and sabotaged the peasant movement, has now been removed from his post by the Administrative Office. The Hebei-Central Hebei District Party Committee has also decided to suspend his Party membership. Zhang is from Wangnou Village, Ding County. In 1944, when Hebei-Central Hebei implemented a major rent reduction, Zhang, in order to evade rent reduction and protect his land, privately organized so-called \"production mutual aid,\" which was actually a \"mutual aid group\" to evade rent reduction. The mutual aid group stipulated that profits should be divided with 40% going to land and capital, and only 60% to labor. He contributed the land and capital, thereby exploiting the peasants in a disguised form. In the winter of 1945, when the peasants of Xihu Village, Ding County, launched a struggle against black land, Zhang expressed extreme dissatisfaction, slandering the peasant movement as \"disrupting social order\" and \"undermining the united front,\" and saying that the peasants' struggle was \"excessive,\" attempting to obstruct the peasants' struggle against black land under the guise of the people's name. Zhang also returned to the village under the pretext of \"inspecting work,\" \"reorganizing\" the Wangnou Village branch, and appointing his subordinates from his \"mutual aid group\" as the branch secretary, which the masses called the \"Zhang Sheng-san branch.\" Last winter, when Hebei-Central Hebei was carrying out land reform, Zhang proposed focusing all efforts on production, thereby diverting the masses' strength. This summer, when Hebei-Central Hebei conducted a review, the district's Production Committee discussed and decided to combine production with the review, but when Zhang drafted production instructions, he did not mention the word \"review.\" At a cadre meeting, he instead said, \"The review hinders production.\" After the review began, the Party called on Party member cadres from landlord backgrounds to play an exemplary role and take the lead in handing over their land and property to the peasants, but Zhang took his mother to live in the Administrative Office to avoid the mass struggle, and also used the influence of his younger brother to send armed men back home to move things.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 前冀中行署农林厅长　破坏土地改革被撤职\n\n1948-01-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　前冀中行署农林厅长\n  　破坏土地改革被撤职\n    【新华社晋察冀电】前冀中行署农林厅长地主分子张省三混入党内，窃居要职，一贯抵抗土地改革破坏农民运动，现已由行署撤职，冀中区党委并决定停止其党籍。张系定县王耨村人，民国三十三年冀中实行大减租，张为逃避减租和保护土地，私自组织所谓“生产互助”，实际乃是逃避减租“互助组”。互助组规定分红办法，是土地和资本分百分之四十，劳力只分百分之六十，他是出土地和资本的，变相剥削农民。民国三十四年冬天，定县西湖村农民掀起反黑地斗争时，张极表不满，诬蔑农运为“破坏社会秩序”，“破坏统一战线”，并说农民的斗争“过火了”，冒充人民名义，企图阻拦农民反黑地斗争。张又回村以“检查工作名义，把王耨村支部加以“改造”，并将其“互助组”里的手下人当支部书记，群众则称为“张省三支部”。去冬冀中正进行土改时，而张却提出全力搞生产，借此分散群众力量。今夏冀中进行复查，该区生产委员会讨论决定生产与复查结合进行，但张在起草生产指示时，却不提复查二字，在干部会上反说：“复查妨害了生产”。复查开始后，党号召地主出身党员干部起模范作用，首将自己的土地财产拿出来交给农民，但张却把他母亲接到行署去住，躲避群众斗争，还借其弟之势力，派武装回家搬运东西。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Moscow: *Pravda* recently commented on Truman's message to the U.S. Congress regarding the \"Marshall Plan,\" stating that the plan arose because: \"The United States wants to maintain domestic prices and the profits of large enterprises, which are already twice as high as wartime levels, at their past levels\" in order to avoid the impending \"most serious economic crisis in history.\" *Pravda* exposed the insidious nature of the Marshall Plan, pointing out that on the one hand, it \"will increase domestic taxes and make prices even more expensive,\" thus \"harming the interests of the American people.\" On the other hand, it uses this plan to \"strangle the freedom and independence of Western European countries, turning the 270 million people of Western Europe into colonial slaves of the United States.\" Economically, the loan conditions stipulate that these countries must produce military supplies for the United States, and \"must prepare a 'non-interest-bearing current deposit' equivalent to the value of the American goods received to ensure payment for the American goods. This fund cannot be freely used without the permission of the United States.\" \"In order to facilitate the import of American goods, all tariff barriers must also be abolished.\" Politically, \"as Truman said in his message, the relationship between the United States and other countries in the Western Hemisphere is the model for the future relationship between the United States and Western European countries.\" *Pravda* strongly stated: \"The Truman-Marshall Plan will encounter increasing resistance in European countries and will cause new conflicts and sharp struggles within the imperialist camp.\"\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: News from various sources: After Truman submitted the \"Marshall Plan\" message to the U.S. Congress, various opinions criticized it. Dutch Communist Party General Secretary de Groot forcefully stated: \"The Marshall Plan attempts to revive fascist Germany and enslave the people of the world.\" Norwegian Member of Parliament Bestad wrote on the 4th: \"We will get dollar loans to buy American goods, but those goods are so expensive that if we use the loans extensively, we will make ourselves slaves of the United States.\" The Danish \"People's Garden Newspaper\" said indignantly on the 9th: This plan \"is less a list of what European countries need than a list of goods the United States wants to sell.\" American historian Schumann revealed on the 7th: \"The Marshall Plan aims at war and weakening the economies of European countries.\" He strongly stated: \"This plan will end in a disastrous failure.\" The American Student Union passed a resolution on the 6th condemning the \"Marshall Plan\" and urging the authorities to refuse to accept American \"aid\" with political conditions attached. Even the British reactionary Conservative Party newspaper \"Daily Express\" and the London \"Evening Standard\" expressed unease due to the excessively harsh terms of the American loan. The \"Evening Standard\" said in its commentary on the 7th: \"If Britain sells its economic freedom, it is better to live as a poor man.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 各方痛斥“马歇尔计划”   它将损害美国人民利益，绞杀西欧各国的自由和独立。\n\n1948-01-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　各方痛斥“马歇尔计划”\n    它将损害美国人民利益，绞杀西欧各国的自由和独立。\n    【新华社陕北十二日电】莫斯科：真理报顷评论杜鲁门向美国会所提之“马歇尔计划”咨文称：这个计划产生的原因，是由于：“美国要把国内的物价和已经两倍于战时的大企业利润，照过去的水平保持下去”，以逃避即将到来的“有史以来最严重的经济危机”。真理报揭露马歇尔计划的毒辣性，指出一方面“将加重国内苛捐杂税，并使物价更加昂贵”，因而“损害了美国人民的利益”。另一方面借这个计划来“绞杀西欧国家的自由和独立，沦西欧二亿七千万人民为美国的殖民地奴隶”。在经济上，贷款条件规定这些国家要为美国生产军需物资，“必须预备一笔与所获美货价值相当的‘无息活期存款’，以保证付给美货价格。该款未经美国准许时，不能自由动用”。“为了便利美货输入，各国还要废除一切关税壁垒”。在政治上，“如杜鲁门在咨文中所说，美国和西半球其它国家间的关系，就是今后美国和西欧国家关系的榜样”。真理报力称：“杜鲁门、马歇尔计划在欧洲国家中将遇到日益增强的抵抗，并将在帝国主义阵营中引起新的冲突与尖锐的争斗”。\n    【新华社陕北十二日电】各方讯：杜鲁门向美国会提出“马歇尔计划”的咨文后，各方舆论纷予抨斥。荷共总书记德格鲁特力称：“马歇尔计划企图使法西斯德国复活，并奴役全世界人民”。挪威国会议员贝斯塔德四日撰文称：“我们将得到美元贷款以购买美货，然而那些货物是那样的贵，倘若我们大量地使用贷款，则我们将使我们自己成为美国的奴隶”。丹麦“人民园地报”于九日愤懑的说：这计划“与其说是欧洲各国需要的清单，还不如说是美国欲出售货物的清单”。美国著名历史学家休曼于七日揭发说：“马歇尔计划目的在于战争及削弱欧洲各国经济”，他力称：“这一计划结果将遭惨败”。美国学联于六日通过决议，谴责“马歇尔计划”，并力促当局拒绝接受附有政治条件的美国“援助”。甚至英国反动的保守党报纸“每日快报”、伦敦“标准晚报”等，也因美国贷款条件的过于苛刻而表示不安。“标准晚报”在七日的评论中称：“英国若果出卖经济自由，不如活着当个穷汉。"

According to TASS: Local garrison soldiers in Bologna, Milan, Udine, Rome, and Palermo held demonstrations on the 5th and 6th, protesting the delayed demobilization of soldiers of the 1925 class. The reactionary Italian government, attempting to increase its troop strength by 3,000 soldiers for the purpose of suppressing the people in the upcoming spring elections, therefore adopted this reactionary decision to delay demobilization. The strikes in Italy continue to expand. According to UPI estimates, \"200,000 workers are involved, with twelve strikes occurring, and increasingly large and fierce battles are breaking out everywhere with the De Gasperi government.\" The strike of 100,000 bank employees nationwide, demanding wage increases, is still continuing. Fishermen in the Adriatic Sea, due to unsuccessful negotiations with shipowners for wage increases, have also announced a strike. A general strike has also occurred in Fano (Adriatic coast) to support the demands of unemployed workers and to protest the employers' violation of promises made in negotiations with trade unions.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Milan dispatch: The Sixth National Congress of the Italian Communist Party, which opened on the 5th, is still continuing.

Vittorio, secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labour, in his report to the congress, emphasized that the achievements of the General Confederation of Labour are mainly due to the Communist Party having become an invincible fortress for the working masses and the victory of New Democracy. Vittorio pointed out that trade unions need to be more united and expressed his belief that the People's Democratic Front will bring a government of working people to Italy. Gregory, the representative from Weilless City, condemned the De Gasperi government for defending U.S. imperialism and called for seeking new ways to expel De Gasperi and the Christian Democrats. Representatives of various fraternal parties paid their respects to the congress and delivered speeches. When French Communist leader Thorez delivered a congratulatory message to the congress and criticized U.S. imperialism for obstructing all economic and political progress, the entire congress stood up, sang the Marseillaise, and paid their respects to him.\n\n　　Also reported: U.S. Communist Party representative Weiss, who was to attend the Italian Communist Party Congress, was prevented from going because the U.S. imperialist authorities refused to issue him a passport. The Central Committee of the U.S. Communist Party has protested to the U.S. State Department. Pieck and Kroetig, leaders of the German Socialist Unity Party, have sent telegrams congratulating the Sixth Congress of the Italian Communist Party and expressing their indignation at the U.S. and British occupation authorities for refusing to issue passports, preventing them from attending the meeting.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 坚决和加斯贝利政府斗争　意国二十万人大罢工\n\n1948-01-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　坚决和加斯贝利政府斗争\n  　意国二十万人大罢工\n    【新华社陕北十一日电】罗马讯：示威及罢工浪潮又遍及意大利。据塔斯社讯：波伦亚、米兰、犹丁、罗马及巴勒摩等地的地方守备队士兵，于五、六两日举行示威，抗议一九二五年一级的士兵延期复员。意反动政府企图增加三千名士兵作为在今春大选中镇压人民之用，因此采取此反动的拖延复员的决定。意罢工仍在继续扩大中。据合众社估计，“被卷入的有二十万工人，有十二处罢工，到处发生与加斯贝利政府愈来愈大愈来愈凶的激战。”要求增资的全国十万银行雇员的罢工，仍在继续中。亚得里亚海渔夫因与船主谈判增资无效，亦已宣布罢工。凡诺城（亚得里亚海滨）也发生总罢工，声援失业工人的要求，并抗议雇主违反与工会谈判中所担负义务的诺言。\n    【新华社陕北十一日电】米兰讯：五日揭幕之意共第六次全国代表大会，仍在继续开会中。当苏联代表犹丁与格里高里、法共领袖多列士、英共领袖波立特等八国兄弟党代表莅会列席时，大会报以热烈的欢呼。意总工会书记维特瑞奥在大会所作报告，强调指出：总工会的成就，主要是由于共产党已变为劳苦大众及新民主主义胜利的无敌堡垒。维氏指出：职工会有更加团结一致的必要，并深信人民民主阵线将带给意大利以劳动人民的政府。卫里斯城的代表格雷里在会上谴责加斯贝利政府为美帝国主义辩护，要求寻求新办法以驱逐加斯贝利及基督教民主党人。各兄弟党代表向大会致敬，并发表演说，当法共领袖多列士向大会致贺辞并抨击美帝国主义阻挠一切经济与政治的进步时，大会全体起立，高唱马赛曲，向其致敬。\n    又讯：美共出席意共代表大会代表魏斯，由于美帝国主义当局拒发护照不准前往，美共中央委员会已向美国务院提出抗议。德国统一社会党领袖皮格及克罗提渥，已电贺意共六大，并对美英占领当局拒发护照致未能赴会表示愤慨。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: London dispatch: The \"Anti-Communist Crusade\" movement launched by the Labour Party in trade unions has suffered a major blow. According to the Workers' Daily on the 8th, in the anti-communist re-elections within the \"Transport and General Workers' Union,\" the largest union upon which Bevin rose to prominence, communists have actually gained many important positions. Communist Jones has been re-elected as chairman of the London Bus Central Committee (36,000 members) of the union. Jones also won the chairmanship in the re-election of the London No. 1 Passenger Transport Committee (65,000 members). In the re-election of the South Wales Executive Committee of the National Union of Mineworkers, after secret ballot by all pit representatives, the original five communists were re-elected. In resolutions of other trade union branches and workshop representative committees, workers continue to condemn Phillip's anti-communist instigation. White, general secretary of the Civil Service Clerical Association, wrote in the Workers' Daily that Phillip's interference in trade union affairs is an \"arrogant absurdity.\" White stated that the real reason for attacking communists is to eliminate trade union members' dissatisfaction with Labour Party policies and to turn trade unions into reactionary tools of the Labour Party, subordinating workers' economic interests to the interests of the Labour Party.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Comprehensive report: The advanced section of the British working class has launched another struggle before the New Year to oppose the Labour Party leadership's reactionary policy of attempting to monopolize the labor movement and create unemployment. On December 22nd last year, with the Conservative and Liberal parties cheering in unison, the Labour Party, in the name of its party secretary Phillip, issued an absurd statement to its lower party organizations and trade union bodies, urging an \"attack\" on the British Communist Party, falsely claiming that the British Communist Party \"is hindering the production movement upon which national prosperity depends.\" In view of the Labour Party's disastrous defeat in the national municipal elections in November last year and the growing dissatisfaction of the British people, especially the workers, with the Labour government, the Labour Party leaders attempted to divert the attention of their party and trade union lower levels through this absurd statement, but were immediately strongly resisted by the advanced section of the British working class. Clackton, member of the General Council of the Scottish Trades Union Congress and officer of the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers, said when referring to the Labour Party leaders' anti-communist movement: \"I have many friends in the labor movement who are communists. I know they are all comrades who sincerely and enthusiastically wish to work for the benefit of the country, especially to improve the welfare of our poor people. I hope to work with them for this purpose.\" The Hatton (Northwest London) branch of the Electrical Trades Union passed a resolution rejecting Phillip's call, saying: \"We demand that the Labour Party pay more attention to our living conditions and pay more attention to the struggle against the Conservative Party.\" Upon receiving Phillip's message, the Scottish Bess and other engineering union district committees held a workshop representative meeting and resolved to demand that the executive committee of the National Union of Engineering Workers lodge a strong protest with the Labour Party executive committee. The Clayton local union in Manchester also passed a similar resolution. The resolution of the North London Committee of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, in addition to protesting Phillip's statement, stated: \"The reason why communists are elected to leadership positions in various trade unions is because of their fighting spirit and policies that take care of everyone.\" Before the New Year, the London District Committee of the Electrical Trades Union, representing its more than 60,000 electrical technicians, expressed indignation at the anti-communist speech of the Labour Party's Deakin and passed a resolution stating that the speech was an insult to trade union members. When Horner, General Secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers of Great Britain, delivered a New Year's Eve speech to all trade union members, he asked them to oppose \"this despicable work\" carried out by Phillip.\n\nIn sharp contrast to the anti-communist movement of the Labour Party leadership, some British trade unions have launched another movement demanding that the Labour Party fulfill its promise of \"full employment.\" In an article in the union magazine before the New Year, Richard Coppock, General Secretary of the Building Trades Operatives, severely criticized the Labour government's policy of abandoning large-scale construction plans and creating unemployment. Coppock stated: All the promises that made the Labour Party return to power have now vanished into thin air. The construction industry is in decline, and this is caused by the Labour government, which has sworn to implement a full employment policy. The current policies of the government can only lead to irreparable disaster. Our way forward is to fight against this paralyzing policy of defeatism. The Standing Committee of the Shop Stewards' National Council of the Engineering and Allied Industries has put forward a call, advocating: reduce the British army to 500,000 people, formulate an engineering industry plan, levy a capital tax, and guarantee workers' living standards in order to change the current economic policies of the Labour Party.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 工党反共阴谋遭重大打击　工会改选英共获胜\n\n1948-01-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　工党反共阴谋遭重大打击\n  　工会改选英共获胜\n    【新华社陕北十二日电】伦敦讯：工党在职工会中所发动的“反共十字军”运动，已遭重大打击。据工人日报八日载称：贝文赖以起家的全国最大工会“运输业及各业工人工会”内部的反共改选中，共产党员反而获得了许多重要职位。共产党员宙恩斯已再次当选为该工会所属伦敦公共汽车中央委员会（会员三万六千人）主席。宙恩斯在伦敦第一区客运委员会（会员六万五千人）的改选中，亦荣获主席之职。全国矿联南威尔士执委会的改选中，经一切矿坑代表的秘密投票结果，原来的五位共产党员，仍然再度当选。在其他职工会分会及车间代表委员会的决议中，工人们继续谴责菲力浦的反共挑拨。公务员协会总书记怀特在工人日报著文称：菲力浦之干涉职工事务，乃是“妄自尊大的狂举”。怀特称：攻击共产党人，其真实原因，是要排除职工会员对工党政策的不满，并使工会变成工党的反动工具，使工人的经济利益服从工党利益。\n    【新华社陕北七日电】综合报导：英国工人阶级的先进部分，在新年前再次展开斗争，以反对工党领导机关企图包办工运及制造失业的反动政策。去年十二月二十二日，工党在保守党与自由党同声喝采之下，以其党书记菲力浦之名义，向其下层党组织及工会机关发出荒谬声明，促请对英国共产党发动“进攻”，谣言英共“正阻挠全国繁荣所依之生产运动”。鉴于去年十一月全国市选中工党在各地的惨败及英国人民特别是工人对工党政府日益增长的不满情绪，工党领导者企图借此项荒诞声明转移其党内及工会下层的视线，但立即遭到英国工人阶级先进部分的强烈抗击。苏格兰职工委员会总会委员暨建筑工程工会干事克兰肯，在论及工党领导者此项反共运动时称：“我有许多工运朋友，都是共产党员，我知道他们都是同志，诚恳热心地愿望为国家的利益，特别是为提高我国贫苦人民的福利而工作，我希望与他们为此目的而共同工作。”电气工会罕顿（伦敦西北区）分会通过决议，拒绝菲力浦的号召称：“我们要求工党多注意我们的生活状况，多注意与保守党斗争。”苏格兰贝斯等机械工会区委会于接获菲力浦文告后，即举行车间代表会议，决议要求全国机械工人工会执委会向工党执委会提出强烈抗议。曼彻斯特克莱顿地方工会亦通过类似决议。机械工会联合会伦敦北区委会之决议，除抗议菲力浦的声明外，并称：“所以要把共产党人选任各职工会的领导职位，是因为他们的战斗精神与照顾全体的政策。”电器工业工会伦敦区委会于年前代表其六万余电气技师则对工党狄舍斯的反共演说表示愤慨，决议称，此项演说乃是对工会会员的侮辱。英国全国矿工联盟总书记霍尔纳除夕向一切工会会员发表演说时，要求他们反对菲力浦所进行的“这种卑鄙工作”。\n    与工党领导机关的反共运动针锋相对，英国若干工会则发动另一运动，要求工党实践“充分就业”的诺言。建筑工人工会联合会总书记范瑟特新年前在工会杂志上撰文，猛烈评击工党政府放弃大规模建设计划并制造失业的政策。范氏称：使得工党重行执政的一切誓言显已形同泡影。建筑工业已在衰退，而这是曾宣誓执行充分就业政策的工党政府所造成的。政府目前的政策仅能招致不可挽救的灾难，我们前进的道路，就是与这种麻痹性的失败主义政策作斗争。英全国工程与附属工业车间代表委员会常委则提出号召，主张：减少英国军队至五十万人，制订工程工业计划，征收资本税，保障工人生活水平，以改变目前工党的经济政策。"

    "date": "1948-01-14",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Su Lu Yu Wan Frontline, 12th: A frontline reporter reports on the characteristics of the Pinghan-Longhai Campaign, saying:\n\n(1) The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has won an unprecedented strategic victory, manifested in the meeting and coordinated operations of the Yu-Shaan-E, E-Yu-Wan, and Su-Lu-Yu-Wan PLA forces in vast areas. The PLA has completely mastered the strategic initiative and advantage, opening up a mobile operational battlefield spanning over a thousand miles. This has rapidly expanded the borders of the newly liberated areas to the heartland of the Chiang bandits. This plays a very significant role in crushing Chiang Kai-shek's \"key defenses\" and accelerating the completion of the PLA's preparations for the next strategic deployment. In this campaign, the PLA cut off the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, a major artery of Chiang Kai-shek's civil war, and once again attacked the Longhai Railway, isolating and surrounding Kaifeng, the provincial capital of Henan. This not only seriously threatened Zhengzhou, the strategic command center, but also seized important towns such as Xuchang, Luohe, and Zhumadian, Chiang Kai-shek's troop deployment bases between Zhengzhou and Xinyang, eliminating tens of thousands of Chiang Kai-shek's active forces and disrupting the entire deployment of the Chiang Kai-shek army in the Central Plains. In particular, the Fifth Corps, since its headquarters and the entire 3rd Division were annihilated, and the 20th Division suffered a devastating blow, the entire corps has largely lost its combat effectiveness. Chiang Kai-shek's main force, the 5th Division, ran around in panic, suffering heavy losses of several thousand men. This forced Qiu Qingquan to dare not reinforce Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, dragging his exhausted troops around the Hao (County), Lu (Yi), Huai (Yang), and Tai (Kang) areas. Seeing the urgency of the situation, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to draw troops from the \"key defense\" forces in the Dabie Mountains at the end of December, including the 9th, 10th, and 11th Divisions, to rescue the Pinghan Railway. Chiang Kai-shek's so-called \"hollow tactics\" have completely failed. Due to the destruction of the Pinghan and Longhai Railways, and the isolation of large cities such as Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, Chiang Kai-shek will have to allocate mobile forces to defend these cities in the future, thus further dispersing and weakening his forces, making it easier for the PLA to annihilate the enemy one by one.\n\n(2) Chiang Kai-shek's insufficient troops and the army's war-weariness have reached a more serious stage. Before this campaign, almost all the forces guarding the Pinghan and Longhai Railways were the remnants of the annihilated troops and puppet miscellaneous security teams, with few main forces. The 115th Regiment of the 39th Brigade of the 40th Division guarding Xuchang, and the 355th Regiment of the 119th Brigade of the 68th Division guarding Lanfeng, were all annihilated three times. The 3rd Division and part of the Independent 26th Brigade were also annihilated twice. Although they had been replenished after being annihilated, they still lacked manpower and weapons. For example, the new recruits of the 355th Regiment had no guns and were just learning to march. The artillery unit of the Independent 26th Brigade had soldiers but no guns, and the heavy weapons battalion of the 1st Cavalry Brigade had guns but no soldiers, which was an empty establishment. Many of the officers and soldiers in these troops had been captured alive by the PLA and then released. They were unwilling to die for Chiang Kai-shek in their hearts, so their combat effectiveness was very weak, and most of them collapsed at the first touch, or surrendered after a slight attack. Many Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, after being surrounded, laid down their weapons in squads, platoons, and companies in an organized and prepared manner. Even Chen De＠, the commander of the 8th Regiment of the 3rd Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line 3rd Division, personally led all the officers and soldiers of the regiment to surrender on the Xiping front. Some soldiers of the 355th Regiment, upon hearing the sound of gunfire, prepared white flags for surrender and hid them on their bodies. Among the weapons captured by the PLA, many guns were still covered with wax oil, proving that Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers laid down their weapons without firing a shot. When the PLA entered Xuchang, a Chiang Kai-shek officer stopped commanding the battle, laid down his weapons, and sat quietly in the room waiting for the PLA for five hours. He said, \"We don't know who we are fighting for. It is better to lay down our weapons sooner than to be killed.\" When Chen Fumin, the Major General Brigade Commander of the 5th Brigade of the Provisional 24th Division, was captured alive, he knelt in front of the PLA commander, crying and saying, \"I am a war criminal and will be dealt with as you see fit,\" and said that his capture was \"expected long ago, only a matter of time.\" This is a new development in the Chiang Kai-shek army's \"generals lack fighting spirit\" and war-weariness.\n\n(3) After land reform and study, and the grievance-airing movement, the PLA's class consciousness has been unprecedentedly enhanced, discipline is particularly good, and marching and combat capabilities have been greatly enhanced, demonstrating heroic and tenacious heroism in combat. A certain unit marched 130 li overnight and annihilated the enemy's 1st Cavalry Brigade at Guanrenzhai with one regiment. A certain unit completely annihilated the enemy's 20th Brigade of the 3rd Division in the Dongjingang Temple battle in Suiping within four hours. In the first few days of the offensive, the PLA captured several county towns every day, advancing more than 100 li. The speed of the PLA's use of troops made the enemy, after being captured alive, still unaware of where the PLA came from. It is now universally known that our army's discipline is strict and that it cherishes the people, so shops remain open as usual after each unit enters the city. Our army also implemented the policy of opening granaries to relieve the poor. In the two cities of Xuchang and Luohe alone, several million catties of relief grain were distributed within a few days after liberation, and more than 100,000 poor people received relief. The PLA is enthusiastically supported by the broad masses of the people everywhere. When our army entered Xuchang and Chenliu, students lined up to welcome them, shouting \"Long live the People's Liberation Army.\" Many farmers, workers, and young students took the initiative to join the PLA.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 我已掌握战略主动和优势　进行下次战略展开的准备  前线记者报导平汉陇海战役特点\n\n1948-01-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　我已掌握战略主动和优势\n  　进行下次战略展开的准备\n    前线记者报导平汉陇海战役特点\n    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线十二日电】前线记者报导平汉、陇海战役的特点说：\n    （一）解放军赢得了战略上空前的胜利，表现在豫陕鄂、鄂豫皖和苏鲁豫皖三大解放军在广大地区上会师，并协同作战，完全掌握了战略上的主动和优势，开辟了纵横一千多里机动作战的战场，把新解放区的边沿迅速扩大到蒋匪的心脏地带，这对于粉碎蒋贼的“重点防御”，和加快完成解放军下次战略展开的准备，起了十分重大的作用。解放军在这次战役中，斩断了蒋匪内战大动脉平汉南段，并再次破击陇海路，孤立和包围蒋匪河南省城开封，不仅严重威胁战略指挥中心郑州，而且夺取了郑州、信阳间蒋匪的屯兵基地许昌、漯河、驻马店等重要城镇，歼灭几万名蒋匪的有生力量，打乱了中原蒋匪军的整个部署。尤其是第五兵团，自从司令部和整三师全军覆没，二十师遭歼灭性打击后，全兵团已大部丧失了战斗力。蒋匪主力整五师东奔西跑，被打得焦头烂额，损失几千人，逼得邱清泉不敢增援郑州、开封，拖着疲困的部队在毫（县）鹿（邑）淮（阳）太（康）地区兜圈子。蒋贼看到形势紧急，被迫在十二月底从大别山“重点防御”部队中，抽调整九师、整十师、整十一师等部救援平汉路，蒋贼的所谓“空心战术”已完全破产。由于平汉、陇海两路被破坏，郑州、开封等大城市被孤立，蒋贼今后必须分出机动兵力去守备这些城市，因而兵力将更加分散和削弱，而解放军也就更加容易一一歼灭敌人。\n    （二）蒋贼的兵力不足和军心厌战，已达到更严重的地步。这次战役前，守备平汉、陇海两路的几乎全是被歼的残余部队和伪杂保安团队等，没有多少主力。守许昌的整四十师三十九旅一一五团，和守兰封的整六十八师一一九旅三五五团，都是三次被歼灭的。整三师和独立二十六旅一部也都是二次被歼灭的。它们在被歼后虽然也补充过，但兵员、武器仍很缺乏。例如三五五团新抓壮丁没有枪，才学开步走，独立廿六旅的炮兵部队有兵没有炮，骑一旅的重兵器营却是有炮没有兵，是个空头建制。这些部队中有不少官兵是曾经被解放军活捉后又放回去的，他们的内心都不愿替蒋贼送死，因此战斗力很弱，多数是一碰就垮，或是稍为打一下就缴枪投降。有好多蒋军在被包围后成班、成排、成连有准备有组织的放下武器，甚至连蒋贼嫡系整三师第三旅第八团团长陈德＠，也亲率全团官兵在西平火线上投降。三五五团士兵有的一听到枪响就做好投降用的白旗，藏在身边。在解放军缴到的武器中，有不少枪，还封满着腊油，证明蒋匪士兵一枪没打就放下了武器。解放军打进许昌时，蒋匪某军官停止指挥战斗，放下武器静坐在房里等了解放军五个钟头，他说：“我们不知道为谁打仗，与其打死不如早些放下武器。”暂二十四师第五旅少将旅长陈扶民被活捉时，跪在解放军指挥员面前，哭着说：“我是战争罪犯，听凭处理”，并说他的被活捉是“早在预料中，只是时间迟早问题”。这是蒋军“将无斗志”，厌战思想新的发展。\n    （三）解放军经过土改学习，诉苦运动后，阶级觉悟空前提高，纪律特别良好，行军和战斗力大大增强，在战斗中表现了英勇顽强的英雄主义。某部一夜急行军一百三十里，以一个团追歼敌骑一旅于官仁砦。某部在遂平东金刚寺战斗中，四个钟头内全部歼灭敌整三师二十旅。在攻势开始几天内，解放军每天拿下几座县城，前进一百多里，用兵的神速，使敌被活捉后还不知道解放军是从那里来的。至我军之纪律严明爱护百姓业已尽人皆知，故各部入城后，商店均照常开门营业。我军并实行开仓济贫，仅许昌、漯河两城市在解放后数天内即放发救济粮三四百万斤，十余万贫苦人民护得救济。解放军处处受到广大人民的热忱拥护，当我军进驻许昌、陈留时，学校学生列队欢迎，高呼“人民解放军万岁”。更有许多农人、工人和青年学生自动要求参加解放军。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Paris dispatch: \"Bidault has sold France to Truman,\" this is what *L'Humanité* said of Bidault's signing of the \"Franco-American Bilateral Agreement\" with American Ambassador to France, Caffery, on the 2nd. The agreement stipulates that France will receive $69 million from the $522.2 million \"US Interim Aid Law for France, Italy, and Austria,\" and France agrees to: (1) The \"aid\" items can be distributed not only by the government but also by private groups under American supervision; (2) Except for oil and petroleum products, goods should be purchased in the United States; (3) France should deposit an amount of francs equivalent to the dollar price of the goods delivered to France, and the unused balance at the end of June will be used for France. This traitorous agreement has caused widespread unease in French public opinion. According to *L'Humanité's* analysis on the 3rd, this agreement \"is actually proof of France's economic surrender to the United States.\" The method of distributing goods not only facilitates French monopoly groups in seeking private gain, but the clause to deposit francs and use them in France will greatly increase American investment in France. After the rumored devaluation of the franc becomes a reality, this investment will allow the United States to buy French factories with less expense and enslave the French economy more deeply. Moreover, *L'Humanité* stated on the 6th that the agreement also \"opens the borders for the activities of the American fifth column, and American controllers and supervisors will be able to demand all the information they want.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Paris dispatch: On the same day that the French reactionaries signed the \"Franco-American Bilateral Agreement\" selling out their country to the United States, they re-submitted the Mayer tax plan, which had been amended and passed by the parliament at the end of last year, to the parliament, and it was passed without reservation by the parliament's reactionary coalition vote on the 5th and 6th. The Schuman reactionary authorities believed that the previously passed tax law was not \"strict\" enough, so in the revised plan, the tax burden of 125 billion francs was completely imposed on workers, peasants, small and medium-sized industrial and commercial businesses, and freelancers. This plan, a \"cruel attack on the common people\" (*L'Humanité*), immediately aroused dissatisfaction among a wide range of French people. A new protest movement is brewing. The General Confederation of Labor convened a national committee in Paris on the day the Mayer bill was passed in the National Assembly (the 5th) to discuss the situation; and on the 7th, it issued a \"Letter to the Working People,\" calling on them to rise up and demand wage increases to cope with the increase in living expenses. The National Committee opposes the Marshall Plan and criticizes the \"Workers' Force\" traitors, declaring that these traitors are largely responsible for the workers' unmet demands. The National Committee calls on the working people to strengthen unity because \"the division of the working class clears the way for poverty and dictatorship.\" At the same time, the National Committee issued a \"Letter to the Youth,\" which pointed out the strength of French young workers in recent strikes and called on them to continue the struggle to improve living standards. The letter called on French youth to launch a nationwide movement to strive for the convening of a French Labor Youth Congress this spring.\n\nMany shops in the Paris area announced a market strike on the 6th to protest the new tax law. On the 7th, Parisian merchants held a mass protest meeting, and the participants unanimously decided not to elect those members of parliament who defended the bill in parliament, and not to trust or assist the government until the government reduces budget expenditures and implements administrative reforms. *L'Humanité*, in denouncing the bill, said: \"As a result of the passage of the Mayer bill, tens of thousands of small and medium-sized factories face bankruptcy, and a large number of employees will lose their jobs. They obey American orders and increase taxes in France, which has become part of the notorious dollar 'aid'.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 比道尔出卖法国给杜鲁门　签订“法美双边协定”  巴黎罢市抗议新税收法\n\n1948-01-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　比道尔出卖法国给杜鲁门\n  　签订“法美双边协定”\n    巴黎罢市抗议新税收法\n    【新华社陕北十一日电】巴黎讯：“比道尔把法国卖给杜鲁门了”，这是人道报对比道尔与美驻法大使卡佛利于二日签订“法美双边协定”的评语。该协定规定法国自“美对法、意、奥临时援助法”五亿二千二百万元项下，获得六千九百万美元的“援助”，而法国同意：（一）“援助”之物品，在美国监督下，不仅可由政府而且也可由私人团体分配；（二）除石油与石油产品外，货物应在美国购买；（三）法国应存放一笔法郎，其价值应与交予法国之货物的美元价格相当，到六月底结存的未动用余款将用于法国。这一卖国协定引起了法国舆论广泛的不安。据人道报三日之分析，这一协定“实际上是法国经济投降美国的证据”。货物的分配法，不仅便利法国垄断集团营私舞弊，而存放一笔法郎并使用于法国的条款，将使美国对法的投资大形增加，在传闻中的法郎贬值成为事实后，这笔投资将使美国以更少的花费购买法国工厂，而更深入地奴役法国经济。不仅如此，六日人道报称该协定并“为美国第五纵队的活动打开疆界，美国管制人与监督人将能要求一切他所想要的情报”。\n    【新华社陕北十一日电】巴黎讯：法国反动当局于签订拍卖祖国于美国的“法美双边协定”同一天，又将去年年底已由议会修正通过的迈耶税收计划加以重订，再次提交议会，并于五、六两日由议会的反动联合票无保留地通过。舒曼反动当局认为前此通过之税收法不“严厉”，因此在重订之计划中，将一千二百五十亿法郎的税收负担，完全强加于工人、农民、中小工商业及自由职业者身上。这一“对小百姓残酷”（人道报）进攻的计划，立即引起法国广泛阶层的不满。新的抗议运动正在酝酿中。总工会于迈耶法案在国民议会通过之日（五日），即于巴黎召开全国委员会，讨论形势；并于七日发表“告劳动人民书”，号召他们起来要求增资以应付生活费的增涨。全委会反对马歇尔计划，并抨击“工人力量”叛徒，宣称工人要求之未获得满足，这些叛徒应负大部分责任。全委会号召劳动人民加强团结，因为“工人阶级的分裂是为贫穷和独裁统治扫清道路”。同时全委会发表“告青年书”，该书指出法国青年工人在最近罢工中的坚强性，并号召他们继续斗争，争取提高生活标准。该书号召法国青年发动全国性运动，争取今春召开法国劳动青年代表大会。\n    巴黎区很多商店则于六日宣布罢市，抗议新税收法。七日巴黎商人并举行群众抗议大会，参加会议者一致决定：不选举那些在议会中维护该法案的议员，并且在政府减低预算支出和实施行政改革以前，不信任政府，不援助政府。人道报在痛斥此一法案时说：“由于迈耶法案通过的结果，成万的中小工厂面临破产，并将有大批职工失业。他们服从美国命令，在法国加税，这成为臭名远扬的美元‘援助’的一部分。”"

In Cologne, thousands of workers at the Westwaggon locomotive factory, ignoring the Social Democratic trade union's order to forcibly return to work, are continuing their strike. Ruhr miners are also fighting against anti-strike measures. Hundreds of workers at the Friedrich-Wilhelm steel factory in Mülheim, Rhine Province, also went on strike on the 3rd to protest the low food rations.

    "content": "Shao Ming Coal Mine Ousts Landlords\n  　Workers Unite, Production Increases\n    [Our Dispatch] The Neiqiu Shao Ming Coal Mine ousted more than 40 speculative landlords last autumn. The workers' enthusiasm for production is greater than before. All the staff and workers of the mine are carrying out a winter production campaign, and everyone has set out the conditions for production increase competition. The factory also guarantees that all materials will be supplied in a timely manner without difficulty. In the past month, various tasks have been improved and enhanced. In terms of production increase: this autumn, one shift produced 20 cans of coal (each can weighing about 700 jin), which is about one can per three people. Before the campaign was launched, the output per worker was 462 jin, about half a can or more. After the campaign started (December), with the increase of new workers and difficult production conditions, the output per worker increased to 609 jin. Worker Hu Chunxi used to only be able to dig 60-70 \"fen\" (a unit of measurement) of the kiln, but now he can dig 1 meter 15. Cai Renao increased from 70-80 fen to 1 meter 25 - 1 meter 3, and also took time to help others pull carts. In the past, the cans were filled to 80%, but now each shift automatically has someone to check, and they are all filled very full. Meng Qingjian and Li Quanbao, workers who work underground, used to set up three or four supports per shift, but now they have doubled that and can set up eight, and they also chop their own pillars and haul the wood. Zhang Chunde, an old worker in the machine shop, used to make four picks per shift, but now he has increased that to ten. In terms of cherishing tools and saving raw materials: Ning Shunxi does not bring broken cart strips and cart frames to the kiln, but automatically repairs them underground. In order to reduce waste, he automatically pulls out the picks, coal blocks, and old wood from the recesses and fills them in again. Zhang Heiniu puts all his effort into taking care of the wood, so that it is not cut off carelessly. The number of damaged picks in the machine shop has been reduced compared to the past. The worker comrades also carefully study and research, and Zhang Lian'er created a \"ku ba\" (handle) for the picks, which can reduce the number of broken picks by 50 per shift per month. In terms of unity between new and old workers, class love is fully developed, which has greatly improved the skills of the new workers. Zhang Lian'er and Shi Jinxiang, old workers underground, said: \"It's not enough for us to know how, we must also teach the comrades underground.\" Under their enthusiastic guidance, coal miners Du Zenglong and Bai Shulin learned how to work underground, and now they have become all-rounders underground, learning how to mine coal, pull carts, and set up supports. Yu Xinzheng, who had just been liberated from the Jingxing Mine, is now working with great enthusiasm after the patient help of the old comrades, and he can do both good and bad jobs. Yang Wenchang, a liberated worker from Jingxing, after realizing his ideological awareness, also told the newly arrived workers about the life of the workers in the liberated areas, inspiring everyone to work actively. Little workers Hou Suozi and Li Zengyun gave their willow hats to Yu Binghuai to wear, and gave their shoes to Huang Baoyu to wear, fully demonstrating class love. According to statistics, in one month, more than 100 new workers learned and improved their skills. At present, all the staff and workers of the factory have been involved in the upsurge of the great production movement, and are now working hard to complete the production of 12,000 tons of coal in the five months of winter and spring (December - April).\n  　　　　　　　　(Chun Yi)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 邵明煤矿挤掉地主　职工团结产量增加\n纯一\n1948-01-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　邵明煤矿挤掉地主\n  　职工团结产量增加\n    【本报消息】内邱邵明煤矿去年秋季挤出投机地主四十多人，工人闹生产劲头比以前更大了，全厂职工开展冬季大生产运动，大家并订出增产竞赛条件；厂方也提出保证一切材料及时供给不受困难。一月来各种工作上都有改进和提高。在增产方面：今年秋季一班出煤二十罐（每罐约七百多斤），约合三人一罐。发动运动前，每工产量为四百六十二斤，约合半罐多。运动开始后（十二月份），在新工人增多及生产条件困难的情况下，每工产量提高到六百零九斤。工人胡春喜原来只能刨六、七十分的窑，现在能刨到一米达一五。蔡热闹则由七○——八○分增到一米达二分五——一米达三，还抽出时间帮别人拉斗。过去装的是八成罐，现在各班自动有专人检查，都装的很满。窑下下棚工人孟清建、李全保过去每班下三四架，现在增加一倍能下到八架，并且还是自己打柱窑拉木头。机务处老工人张春德过去打镐每班打四张，现在提高到打十张。在爱护工具节省原料方面：宁顺喜把坏了的斗条斗架不往窑上弄，自动在窑下修理好。为了减少浪费，他并自动的把研于窝里的镐、炭块、旧木头拉出来再填实。张黑牛用尽心思来设法顾对木头，使不随便瞎截。机务处尖镐比过去减少了尖毁坏的数目。工人同志还精心钻研，张连二创造了镐的裤把（柄），这样每班一月可少坏五十根镐。在新老工人团结上，充分发扬阶级友爱，使得新工人技术大为提高。下棚老工人张连二、石金相说：“光咱会了不行，还要把窑下同志都教会。”在他俩热心指导下，刨煤工人杜增隆、白树林学会了下棚，现在成了窑下的全把式，刨煤、拉斗、下橱都学会了。刚从井陉矿解放来的于新忠，经老同志们耐心帮助，现在他干的很带劲，好坏道都行啦。井陉解放工人杨文昌思想觉悟后，还给新来的工人讲说解放区工人生活，启发大家积极工作。小工人侯锁子、李增云把自己戴的柳帽给了于兵怀戴，并且把鞋送给黄宝玉穿，充分显示出阶级热爱。据统计一月当中，有一百多新工人学会与提高了技术，目前全厂职工人员都已卷入大生产运动热潮里，现正为完成冬春五个月（十二月——四月）一万两千吨煤产量而努力。\n  　　　　　　　　（纯一）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 10th. After the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region suffered severe damage from Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, 400,000 people are facing famine. According to incomplete statistics, 195 out of the 217 districts in the entire Border Region were ravaged by Chiang Kai-shek's bestial hooves, resulting in losses of 190,000 shi of grain, over 62,000 head of cattle, over 100,000 pieces of farm equipment, and the abandonment of over 3.6 million mu of cultivated land. The damage was particularly severe in counties such as Mizhi, Zhenchuan, Jiaxian, Hengshan, Zizhou, Jingbian, Yanchuan, Anse, and Zichang. In addition to dispatching several relief teams to various disaster areas around October and allocating huge amounts of grain and funds for relief, the Border Region Government has also implemented austerity measures in local government agencies to save resources for disaster relief and launched mass disaster relief campaigns. All employees of the Northwest Printing Factory have been saving four liang of millet per person per day since the 9th of last month to help disaster victims. County-level government agencies in Yanchuan County launched a mass donation campaign of \"one sheng of rice, one piece of clothing, one basket of dates, and one bowl.\" Cadres save one liang of rice per person per day and organize disaster area visiting groups for emergency relief. At the recent summary meeting on production and disaster relief, Jia Tuofu, Deputy Director of the Northwest Financial and Economic Office, pointed out ten measures for disaster relief production: combining land reform, organizing winter sideline production, developing rural small-scale cooperation, mobilizing the masses for mutual aid, launching grain protection struggles, allocating and using rural public property, practicing thrift and planned migration, and providing government loans to prepare for spring production. He also pointed out to all cadres who are about to depart for the disaster areas again: they must establish a class perspective, be hardworking and endure hardship, serve the impoverished disaster victims faithfully, and fight to overcome the severe Chiang's calamities.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陕甘宁边区政府救济受蒋灾难民\n\n1948-01-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　陕甘宁边区政府救济受蒋灾难民\n    【新华社西北十日电】陕甘宁边区遭受蒋匪严重破坏后，有四十万人民面临饥馑。据不完全统计，全边区二百十七个区遭受蒋匪兽蹄破坏者，即达一百九十五个区，损失粮食十九万石，牛六万二千余头，农具十余万件，荒芜耕地三百六十余万亩，而在米脂、镇川、葭县、横山、子洲、靖边、延川、安塞、子长等县受害尤为严重。边府除已于十月前后分派若干救济小组赴各灾区，拨发巨额粮款赈济外，各地政府机关均节约救灾，开展群众性的救灾运动。西北印刷厂全体职工自上月九日起每人每日节省小米四两救济灾民。延川县级机关发起“一升米，一件衣，一筐枣，一个碗”的群众性募捐运动。干部每人每天节省米一两，并组织救灾区访问团紧急救济。最近在生产救灾总结大会上，西北财经办事处副主任贾拓夫指出救灾生产十项办法：结合土改，组织冬季副业生产，发展农村小型合作，发动群众互救互助，展开护粮斗争，分配使用农村公产，节衣缩食有计划的移民，政府贷款准备春季生产等。并对即将再次出发灾区全体干部指出：要确立阶级观点，刻苦耐劳，为贫苦灾民忠诚服务，为战胜严重蒋灾而斗争。"

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Frontline, 12th: Frontline reporters Feng Mu and Wu Daxiang report: As soon as the battle to annihilate the Reorganized 3rd Division ended, Li Yingcai, the Chief of Staff of the Kuomintang's Fifth Army Corps who was captured first, was sent to the regiment headquarters of a certain regiment that was the main attacking force. He was short and stout, wearing a soldier's cotton hat. He had taken off his coat because he couldn't run, leaving only a set of thin clothes, and was draped in a tattered military blanket. He broke his foot when jumping off the city wall, and walked with a limp. When reporters asked about the details of the Reorganized 3rd Division's demise, he said: \"This time, we were ordered by Gu Zhutong to march north at full speed to relieve the siege of Yancheng. When we reached Ershilipu, Xiping, and made contact with your army, we immediately realized the situation was serious. We immediately requested reinforcements from Zhengzhou, but the reply said that the 20th Division could not come, and that your army's main force had already moved south, and finally told us to 'handle the situation as appropriate.' We could neither advance nor retreat, so we had to shrink back into two villages to hold out for reinforcements. But as soon as we entered the villages, we found that we had already been surrounded by you on all sides. After being surrounded, the troops' panic, chaos, and weak combat effectiveness were extremely alarming. In the southeast of Zhuwangzhai, our defending soldiers were a Weihe brigade directly under our command. You only had about two thousand people, but as soon as the guns fired, an entire regiment of ours collapsed, leaving less than a hundred people to escape back to the village. When you attacked the 20th Brigade in Jingangsi, we sent a telegram asking them to close in, but before we even received a reply, the battle at Jingangsi was over, and only a few people retreated.\"\n\nWhen reporters asked about the final breakthrough, Li Yingcai showed a look of mingled crying and laughing, saying: \"Hearing that the 20th Brigade had been annihilated, and the 7th and 8th Regiments on the periphery of Zhuwangzhai had also been battered, we were even more panicked. Li Tiejun rushed over in a panic and told me to escape and gather near Suiping. As I was packing, there was artillery fire outside, and the streets suddenly became chaotic with people shouting and horses neighing. I didn't even have time to pack my things and followed them to the southeast village wall. The officers and soldiers of the army corps headquarters and division headquarters were all scrambling to escape from the city. I held onto a horse's tail and squeezed down the city wall. Above, there were also people pushing horses, crying and screaming. They pushed me down, and I ran to the east village wall. The east was filled with shouts of killing. I ran to the west village wall, and the west was under heavy fire. There was no way, so I had to run back to the southeast. Seeing the more than two-zhang-high village wall, my legs were already shaking. As I was hesitating, I was pushed off the village wall by the people behind me, and my foot was injured as a result. Two guards helped me, but we couldn't walk half a li before the charge sounded from all directions, and I was captured at that time.\"\n\nWhen talking about the reasons for the Reorganized 3rd Division's demise, Li Yingcai pointed out: \"First, the Chiang bandit headquarters' entire strategic policy was unclear and completely passive. Second, the middle-level commanders were constantly scheming against each other and holding each other back, causing the lower levels to be passively beaten. Third, your army's strategic policy is clear and your tactics are brilliant. We were extremely tired from traveling all day long. If we were a little slow, Zhengzhou would send telegrams, either scolding us or resorting to military law. I rode a horse all day, but I even fainted on horseback at Songshuping, Nanzhao. The fatigue of the lower-level officers is even more unimaginable. This time, when we arrived at Xiping, we were already hoarse and exhausted, and we were finished as soon as we made contact.\"\n\nLi Yingcai is from Hunan and graduated from the fourth class of Whampoa Military Academy. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as the Chief of Staff of the 87th Division and the Chief of Staff of the New 12th Army. He was assigned to the Reorganized 3rd Division after it was first annihilated at Dayang Lake, first as the Chief of the General Staff and then promoted to Major General Chief of Staff. He is now forty years old. According to his own account, he has been a Major General for thirteen years.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “一和人民解放军接触我们就整团的垮了”  蒋军第五兵团参谋长自供\n冯牧　吴答祥\n1948-01-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“一和人民解放军接触我们就整团的垮了”\n    蒋军第五兵团参谋长自供\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十二日电】前线记者冯牧、吴答祥报导：歼灭整三师的战斗刚一结束，首先被俘的蒋军第五兵团参谋长李英才就被送到担任主攻的某团团部来。他身体矮胖，戴着一顶士兵棉帽，衣服因为跑不动脱掉了，只剩一套单衣裤，身上披着一条破军毯，他在跳城墙时跌破了脚，走起来一跛一跛的。记者问起这次整三师覆没的经过，他说：“这次是奉顾祝同命令兼程北上解郾城之围的。当我们走到西平二十里铺和贵军刚一接触就发现情况严重，立刻向郑州求援，但是来电却说二十师不能来，又说贵军主力业已南下，最后叫我们“酌情处理”，我们既进不得又退不得，只好缩到两个寨子里据守待援。但是一进到寨子里，就发现已经被你们四面包围了。被包围后部队的恐慌混乱和战斗力的低弱是非常惊人的。在祝王砦东南我们的守兵是一个围和旅直，你们不过两千人，但是枪刚一响，我们的一个整团就垮了，只剩下不足一百人逃过寨来，你们进攻金刚寺的二十旅时，我们去电要他们靠拢，但是还没等到回电，金刚寺已经解决战斗，退回的只有几个人。\n    当记者问起最后突围的情形，李英才显出一幅哭笑不得的神情说：听到二十旅被歼，祝王砦外围的七团、八团也被打得七零八落，我们就更恐慌了。李铁军慌慌张张的跑来叫我逃出后到遂平附近集合，我正收拾东西时，外面炮响了，街上忽然人喊马叫，乱做一团，我东西也来不及收拾就随着他们向东南寨墙跑去。兵团部和师部的官兵都争先恐后的从城上逃下去。我拉着马尾巴挤下了城头，上面也是人挤马跳，哭喊连天。把我挤了下来，我又跑到东寨墙，东面是一片喊杀声，跑到西寨墙，西面炮火正密，没办法只得又跑到东南面，看到两丈多高的塞墙，脚已经发抖了，正犹豫时就被后面的人挤推下寨墙，脚因此跌伤了。两个卫士扶着我走不了半里路，四面都响起冲锋号，我也在这时被俘虏了。\n    谈到整三师覆没的原因时，李英才指出：第一、蒋匪统帅部整个战略方针不明确，完全被动。第二、中层各派指挥员处处钩心斗角，互相牵制，致使下面被动挨打。第三、贵军的战略方针明确，战卫高妙。我们终日赶路异常疲劳。稍一慢些，郑州就来电报，不是申斥就是军法从事。我终日骑马，但到南召松树坪时也在马上晕了过去，下级军官的疲惫更不可想象了。这次到了西平已经声嘶力竭，才一接触就完蛋了。\n    李英才是湖南人，黄埔四期毕业，抗战中曾任八十七师参谋长，新十二军参谋长等职。整三师第一次被歼于大杨湖后到职，先仟参谋处长后提升为少将参谋长，现年四十岁，据他自谈，任少将已十三年。"

For example, on page two, in the statement \"The Northeast Democratic Allied Army was renamed the People's Liberation Army,\" there is the phrase: \"After Commander-in-Chief Lin suggested it to the Central Military Commission, and it was approved by the Central Military Commission...\" Many of us questioned why our Democratic Allied Army had to be renamed the People's Liberation Army and needed the \"Central Military Commission\" to approve it. What right did they have to approve us!? Later, after other comrades explained that it was an abbreviation for the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and not the Kuomintang Central Military Commission, we realized the misunderstanding.

Ever since the battle of Zhangbao, in which one enemy battalion was wiped out, the 61st Army stationed at Zhangliang has been terrified. They dare not sleep in Zhangliang at night, and go to the Yi'an stronghold to spend the night instead. Wang Zhilong learned of this situation and on the night of the 24th, he and Song Biao and the members of the Qiao Degong combat team sneaked to the edge of Zhangliang village. After the enemy's large force had passed, they entered the village, first capturing the puppet village chief and ordering him to lead the way to Liang Bingyuan's courtyard, the location of the puppet village office. From there, they reached the Kuixinglou large bunker in the southeast corner, and used two bundles of sorghum stalks and a match to set the bunker ablaze. The small bunkers on the south and east gate towers were also soon on fire. The flames illuminated the entire village, and the enemies at the North Pass bunker (Hongshan stronghold) and the Yi'an railway station organized heavy firepower to fire towards Zhangliang, but they dared not come down to put out the fire. On the 27th, Wang Zhilong went alone to Neidaxu village, which is a little over a mile north of the station and less than a mile south of Zhangliang. Small groups of \"hook-up troops\" often passed through here. At lunchtime that day, three hook-up soldiers with rifles slung over their backs walked over from the north and ran into Wang Zhilong. He pulled out his pistol and shouted at the enemies to stop. Two of them disobeyed and turned to run away. Wang Zhilong fired and shot one down. One enemy standing in front of him seized the opportunity to pounce on him, trying to capture him alive. Zhilong threw away his pistol and wrestled with him.

On the 4th, at dawn, a part of our local corps ambushed in the Wuyuegou area, more than 60 miles west of Yiyang, and captured the bandit Feng Kegong's squad leader and two others.

Another group of bandits also had one man killed by a landmine in Shiduopo. At dawn on the 8th, Comrade Li Zhifang, the head of Xinan County, led the guerrillas of the second and fourth districts and the militia of the first district to surround Wang Shangli's gang of bandits, more than 30 in total, at Wangtou Temple, south of Hengshi Town, and wiped them out cleanly.

    "content": "【Taihang News】After receiving the Land Law Outline, the Shengsi Camel Village in the Eighth District of She County, in order to allow the hired laborers and poor peasants to understand and master it first, to prevent landlords and rich peasants from taking advantage of loopholes, spreading rumors, distorting the law, and launching counterattacks, convened more than forty hired peasants and poor peasants to read it to them first. During the reading, the hired laborers and poor peasants listened attentively and offered some suggestions. Chen Wantian said: \"This method is good, but I have an objection to the method of giving landlords a share. Giving is necessary, but they must hand over everything they have exploited from us and bow their heads. The landlords in our village eat and dress better than us and have never suffered a day. We can't give them a share first.” Duan Xifang continued: \"That's right! My family has always used manual labor to grind flour, for five generations. The landlords use animals. It won't be fair unless we clean them out first and then give them a share.” Ma Baoan said: \"In the past, we suffered, we were treated like donkeys. Even now the landlords in our village are still better off than us! This time when delivering public grain, we still carry it like donkeys, while the landlords and rich peasants use good animals to carry it, and they don't carry anything themselves. I don't agree with giving them a share first in this situation. Only after a thorough reckoning can we give them a share.\" Ma Qitang said: \"The landlords and rich peasants haven't bowed their heads yet. Ma Sanyuan, a landlord in our village, is still having affairs and scolding the masses, saying, 'You sons of bitches struggled against me, and even after I die, I'll still get you sons of bitches.' If they don't bow their heads, we can't give them a share first.” All forty-plus hired laborers and poor peasants felt the same way. Their second opinion was: Our village is a poor village, with an average of less than two mu of bad land per person. When dividing the land equally, we need to immigrate to wealthier villages, or we won't be able to turn ourselves around.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 先将地主斗透才能给他一份　圣寺驼贫雇研究土地法\n\n1948-01-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　先将地主斗透才能给他一份\n  　圣寺驼贫雇研究土地法\n    【太行消息】涉县八区圣寺驼村，在收到土地法大纲后，为了先让雇贫知道和掌握，以防地主富农钻空造谣曲解和反攻，就召集了四十多个雇贫农民，先念给他们听。在念的当中，雇贫很专心听，并随着提了些意见。陈万田说：“这个办法就是好，可是给地主分一份的办法，我有意见，分是要分，可总得叫他们把剥削咱的东西拿干净，低了头才行。象咱村地主，都比咱吃的好穿的好，一天罪也没受过，可不能先分。”段西方接着说：“对！我家磨面总是人推，推了五辈了，到如今还是人推。人家地主还是用牲口推。不弄干净，就不能给他分。”马保安说：“过去咱受罪，咱当驴，现在咱村地主还是比咱得劲哩！这次送公粮，咱还是当驴担哩，地主富农赶好着牲口驮着不担，他们一天罪也没受。象这样就先分给他一份，我就不同意。就是先清算彻底了，才能给他们分。”马起堂说：“地主富农就是还没有低头，咱村地主马三元还搞破鞋，还骂群众说：“你狗日们斗了我，死了也得搞了你狗们，象这样不低头，就不能先给他分。”四十多个雇贫意见都是这样。他们的第二个意见是：咱这村是个穷村，每人平均不到二亩坏地，平分时得往富村移民，要不就翻不透身。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 13th: The Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters has just released Operations Communiqué No. 20, announcing the complete annihilation of the enemy's 195th Division and 43rd Division, two entire divisions, and the details and results of the annihilation of the New 5th Army headquarters, stating:\n\nDuring the winter offensive, our army captured Zhangwu, completely annihilated the enemy's 79th Division and one regiment of the 207th Division, and routed the Provisional 59th Division, the 10th Cavalry Brigade, and other units. We also completely surrounded the enemy's Provisional 62nd Division of the New 6th Army in Faku, directly threatening Shenyang. The bandit leader Chen Cheng then hastily transferred the entire New 1st Army and more than two divisions of the 71st Army from Changchun to reinforce the south. By the end of last year, within a circle centered on Shenyang with a radius of one hundred li, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits had amassed half of their Northeast regular army, totaling 29 divisions, and 15 divisions of local troops, for a total force of 44 divisions. The majority of these forces, namely: the entire New 1st Army and New 3rd Army, totaling six divisions; the 195th and 43rd divisions of the New 5th Army; the New 22nd and 169th divisions of the New 6th Army; the 130th Division of the 53rd Army; the 87th and 91st divisions of the 71st Army; one regiment of the 88th Division; two regiments of the 207th Division; the Provisional 55th Division, and others, totaling 15 divisions, were deployed along the banks of the Liao River on a front of just over two hundred li between Xinmin in the northwest of Shenyang and Tieling. Starting on New Year's Day, they advanced westward and northward in a fan shape at a slow, steady pace, attempting to drive away our army, thereby ensuring the safety of Shenyang and further relieving the siege of Faku. When the enemy's left wing advanced northward to the vicinity of Gongzhutun (forty li northeast of Xinmin), our powerful army corps, with the force of thunder, cleaved through the dense enemy阵地 starting on the 5th of this month, wedging into the side and rear of the enemy's left wing from the northeast suburbs of Xinmin and Liaobinta northeast of the city, completing the pincer encirclement of the 195th Division and 43rd Division of the New 5th Army. The remaining enemies, no longer daring to attempt to relieve Faku, hurriedly reinforced the Gongzhutun direction to the west. Our army corps responsible for blocking rose up to block the reinforcing enemy. From then on, a large-scale annihilation battle and blocking battle unfolded fiercely outside the bandit nest of Shenyang. Starting at 14:00 on the 5th, our army launched a general offensive against the surrounded enemy. In an area of over one hundred li, from Gongzhutun in the north to the near suburbs of Xinmin in the south, our army, with high morale, braved the extreme cold of Guanwai, treading on ice and snow, sweeping across the area, using intense firepower to fight for every village and house, destroying the enemy's stubborn resistance, dividing them one by one, and successively annihilating the bandit troops in Anfutun, Qianhou Wenjiatai, Huangjiashan, and other places. By 20:00 on the 7th, after a total of 54 hours of fierce fighting, the entire unit was finally wiped out. At the same time, our army corps responsible for blocking, in a protruding arc-shaped area thirty li wide and one hundred and sixty li long from Shenyang to Shifosi, north of Shenyang, and west of the highway, blocked the entire three divisions of the New 3rd Army, the New 28th and 169th divisions of the New 6th Army, the New 30th Division of the New 1st Army, the 87th and 91st divisions of the 71st Army, the Provisional 55th Division of the 49th Army, and the 2nd Division of the 52nd Army (coming to reinforce from Shenyang), totaling more than ten divisions. Under the bombardment of enemy aircraft, tanks, and fierce artillery fire, our soldiers bravely charged forward, engaging in hand-to-hand combat, repeatedly fighting for every ice-covered and snow-covered terrain and feature, resolutely forcing the enemy, several times our number, to stop at the predetermined blocking positions, failing to cross our lines even a step, and killing and wounding more than 4,000 of them, enabling our army to smoothly carry out the encirclement and annihilation of the New 5th Army headquarters and the 195th and 43rd divisions, making a great contribution. The results of this battle are now announced as follows:\n\n    (1) A total of over 16,000 officers and soldiers of the New 5th Army headquarters and the 195th and 43rd divisions were killed, wounded, or captured, including the death of Chen Hualong, deputy division commander of the 43rd Division, and the killing and wounding of over 4,000 officers and soldiers of the aforementioned units. The following enemy personnel were captured alive: Xie Daizheng, division commander of the 195th Division; Miao Guangtian, division commander of the 43rd Division; Chen Shijie, chief of staff of the 195th Division; Yi Xiyin, chief of staff of the 43rd Division; Zhou Zhenyu, commander of the 583rd Regiment; Zhang Genwen, commander of the 584th Regiment; Li Zhongxi, commander of the 585th Regiment; Ding Bolin, commander of the 128th Regiment; and over 12,000 other officers and soldiers.\n\n    (2) Captured: 2 heavy artillery pieces, 4 field guns, 7 mountain guns, 8 infantry guns, 5 chemical mortars, 43 mortars, 13 rocket launchers, 142 60mm mortars, 70 grenade launchers, 121 heavy machine guns, 647 light machine guns, 952 submachine guns, 5,374 various guns, 2,192,158 rounds of various bullets, 9,185 rounds of various artillery shells, 13 radio stations, 3 automobiles, and 1,409 mules and horses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 公主屯歼敌一万六  活捉两个师长四个团长打退蒋匪援兵十个多师\n\n1948-01-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　公主屯歼敌一万六\n    活捉两个师长四个团长打退蒋匪援兵十个多师\n    【新华社东北前线十三日电】东北人民解放军司令部顷发表第二十号作战公报，公布我军全歼敌一九五师、四十三师两个整师及新五军军部经过及其战果称：\n    我军于冬季攻势中攻占彰武，全歼敌七九师，二○七师一个团，击溃暂五九师，骑十旅等部后，并完全包围法库敌新六军之暂六二师，直逼沈阳。匪首陈诚乃仓惶将原在长春之新一军全部、四平七一军两个多师，先后南调增援。至去年年底，在以沈阳为中心，以一百里为半径的圆圈内，蒋匪集结之兵力占其东北正规军二十九个师，地方军十五个师，共四四个师兵力的一半，并以其中的一大半，即：新一军、新三军全部六个师，新五军一九五、四三两个师，新六军新二十二、一六九两个师，五十三军一三○师，七一军八七、九一两个师，八八师一个团，二○七师两个团，暂五五师等共十五个师兵力，满布于沈阳西北新民至铁岭间，仅二百余里宽正面的辽河两岸，于今年元旦日起，以齐头龟步，向西向北作扇形推进，妄图驱逐我军，借以保障沈阳安全，并进而解除法库之围。我军待其左翼一路北进至公主屯（新民东北四十里）附近时，于本月五日起我各强大兵团，突以雷霆之势，劈裂密集之敌阵，从新民东北郊及该城东北之辽滨塔楔入敌左路之侧后，完成对新五军一九五师及四十三师之钳形包围。余敌不敢再作解围法库之，慌忙向西面的公主屯方向增援。我担任阻击之各兵团，则奋起阻击此应援之敌。自此规模巨大的歼灭战与阻击战遂于匪巢沈阳门外激烈展开。五日十四时起我军发动对被围敌之总攻，于北起公主屯，南至新民近郊方圆百余里地区内，我军以高昂士气，冒关外之奇寒，踏冰履雪，纵横扫荡，以炽盛火力作逐村逐屋之争夺，摧毁敌人顽抗，将其逐一分割，先后聚歼匪军于安福屯、前后文家台、黄家山等地。至七日二十时共历五四小时激战，终于全部消灭该部。与此同时，我担任阻击之各兵团，则于沈阳至石佛寺，沈阳以北、公路以西宽三十余里，长达一百六十余里之凸出弧形地带，阻击敌新三军全部三个师，新六军新二十八、一六九两个师，新一军新三十师、七一军八七、九一两个师，四九军暂五五师，五二军第二师（从沈阳来援）等十个多师。在敌飞机、坦克与猛烈炮火轰击下，我将士奋勇争先，与敌肉搏冲锋，反复争夺每一冰铺雪盖之地形地物，坚决强迫数倍于我之敌，停止于预定阻击地点，而未能越过我阵地一步，并斩获其四千余人，使我军围歼敌新五军军部及一九五和四十三两个师得以顺利进行，共建奇功。兹将此役战果公布于下：\n    （一）总计毙伤俘匪新五军军部一九五、四十三两个师官兵一万六千余名，其中毙匪四十三师副师长陈化龙及毙伤上述各部官兵四○○○余名。生俘匪一九五师师长谢代蒸、四十三师师长苗光天、一九五师参谋长陈士杰、四十三师参谋长易希殷、五八三团团长周真愚、五八四团团长张根文、五八五团团长李钟喜、一二八团团长丁柏林等以下官兵一二○○○余名。\n    （二）缴获：重炮二门、野炮四门、山炮七门、步兵炮八门、化学迫击炮五门、迫击炮四三门、火箭炮十三门、六○炮一四二门、掷弹筒七十个、重机枪一二一挺、轻机枪六四七挺、冲锋式九五二支、各种枪五三七四支、各种子弹二一九二一五八发、各种炮弹九一八五发、电台十三部、汽车三辆、骡马一四○九匹。"

    "content": "Cutting Out the Tumor\n    ——A Record of the Liberation of Changyuan\n    ·Cui Dianchen·    \n　　　　I.\n    Changyuan County, east of the Pinghan Railway, was a remaining stronghold in northern Henan, a tumor growing on the people. More than two thousand Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops of the Ji Bao 12th Regiment and local miscellaneous bandits were trapped there. The city was known as Nine Li Thirteen Steps, with all four gates surrounded by walls (three layers of gates). The city walls were two zhang high and about one zhang seven thick, capable of garrisoning a battalion. Every fifty to sixty meters, there was a protruding bunker with three layers of gun holes and tunnels extending directly outside the city. Outside the bunkers, two outer trenches were built around the city, each one zhang six or seven wide and deep, with two wooden walls made of tree trunks and willow branches. Inside the city, large and small碉堡 (diǎobǎo) pillboxes were scattered everywhere. The area outside the city was flat and sparsely populated. Relying on this so-called \"impregnable\" city wall, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits attempted to resist the people. But they still knew that no fortifications could stop the People's Liberation Army. So they started new busywork, forcing tens of thousands of people around the city every day, filled with trepidation, to rush to build new defensive works.\n    　　　　II.\n    The masses were waiting day and night for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army to cut off this tumor for them.\n    On December 18th, the People's Liberation Army advanced to Mazhuang and Zaoke, north of Changyuan City. It was just after the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' bestial trampling. The pots and bowls of the villagers were smashed, doors and windows were burned, livestock and clothing were looted, and the corpses of the murdered masses lay bleeding by the roadside. On the snow-covered Hebei-Shandong-Henan Plain, people who had been made homeless by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits staggered along, their cries merging into one. When they saw their own soldiers arrive, they knew the day of revenge had come.\n    On the morning of the 19th, the 1st Battalion held a combat mobilization meeting. The affected masses, supporting the old and carrying the young, rushed into the meeting place shouting slogans such as \"Support the People's Liberation Army in attacking Changyuan and avenging us!\" The wife of the militia captain, with disheveled hair, holding her child, wept uncontrollably. She walked up to the soldiers, and choking with sobs, said: \"My man...the militia captain...was killed by the enemy this morning...\" With a groan, she fainted on the ground. The masses rushed to call out: Wake up! Don't cry! Tell us! Tell our troops! They will surely avenge us!\n    \"Leaving my four family members behind, how...how...are we going to live!\" Another woman cried and fell to the ground. One accusation after another followed. The whole place was silent. From the ranks of soldiers came a roar of hatred: We must avenge the people! We will resolutely take Changyuan City!\n    Before the departure, the masses sent many iron shovels for the soldiers to use for fortifications. On the handles of the shovels were pasted bright red strips of paper, on which were written the words \"Take Changyuan,\" what great encouragement!\n    The troops set out fully armed. The cheering masses waved two red flags, beat gongs and drums, and shouted slogans such as \"Take Changyuan! Get back our things! Bring back our livestock!\" Many people even competed to carry large pots and carry luggage for the soldiers. The soldiers declined with the slogan \"Resolutely avenge the masses.\"\n    　　　　III.\n    At 3:00 PM on the 21st, the general offensive began. More than a hundred artillery pieces of various calibers, including榴弹炮 (liúdànpào) howitzers, field guns, and mountain guns, which the Chiang bandits gave us, along with hundreds of light and heavy machine guns, bombarded the north gate of Changyuan into a sea of fire. The city walls collapsed, bricks and stones flew everywhere, and dust shot straight into the sky. The assault soldiers lying on the ground were all deafened and dizzy. A gap of two or three meters opened in the city wall. The soldiers, carrying ladders, rushed towards the city wall through the smoke and dust. The stubbornly resisting Chiang bandits desperately blocked the gap. Two charges were beaten back by bombs: the company commander and the political instructor were both wounded. At this time, the second platoon leader, Comrade Qin Shaoyi, a hero in killing the enemy, volunteered to act as the company commander. After reorganizing the team, he said to the deputy political instructor: I will definitely complete the assault mission. Then, he led the team to charge. Deputy Battalion Commander Comrade Liu Shaopu immediately shouted: \"We must strive to be the first to climb the city!\" While shouting, he rushed out. While crossing the first row of chevaux de frise, Comrades Qin and Liu fell one after another. The instructor reorganized the team for the third time and said: \"Comrades! We must carry forward the tenacity of the Guitun battle! Respond to the demands of the Changyuan masses, and not lose face for the people!\" While the troops were advancing, the instructor was wounded in the waist. Company Commander Li Lin continued to lead the troops straight to the city wall. Squad Leader Wang ShouKui led his squad of six men and quickly crossed the second row of chevaux de frise. The enemy's bombs did not stop their advance. At this time, the gap in the city wall had been expanded more than ten times larger than the first time by our artillery fire. They quickly and nimbly climbed up along the collapsed city wall. At this time, there were fifty or sixty enemies in the protruding part east of the gap, still firing fiercely downwards. Comrade Wang ShouKui shot down the first one. Another turned around to run, but was immediately shot down by Wang ShouKui. By this time, the troops had rushed to the base of the city wall. Seeing that things were not going well, the enemies ran away with their tails between their legs. The troops rushed into the city.\n    　　　　IV.\n    Zhu Ziwen, the mutual aid team leader of the 2nd Company, 3rd Platoon, was liberated from the Tangyin battle. As soon as the troops rushed into Changyuan Street, he saw the enemy running into a courtyard. He threw bombs while shouting: \"The People's Liberation Army gives preferential treatment to prisoners, those who lay down their arms will not be killed!\" Then he jumped over the courtyard wall, which was more than a zhang high. The enemy was in chaos, shouting, \"It's over! Let's surrender! Let's surrender!\" He heard this, quickly stepped forward and shouted loudly: \"Don't move!

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 13th: Late News: A certain unit of the local troops of the Jilin Military Region once entered Changchun city in two routes on New Year's Eve, and after severely defeating more than 600 Chiang bandits, they voluntarily withdrew. One route of our army first annihilated a Chiang bandit platoon in Yangjiadian, a suburb of Changchun, before New Year's Eve. At 10:00 PM on the 31st, it attacked the East Daqiao Railway Station in the city, and after fierce fighting until 9:00 AM on the 1st, annihilated the defending enemy, a company, as well as local police and Mongolian cavalry, totaling more than 500 people. Among them, more than 200 were killed or wounded and captured, and a large number of guns, ammunition, and war horses were seized. On the same day, another route of our army attacked Erdaohezi in the city, and after five hours of fierce fighting, captured more than 70 people and guns. Another unit of our army raided the Bali Fort area in the suburbs the day before New Year's Eve and fought the enemy for two hours, capturing more than 50 alive, seizing more than 100 rifles, more than 100 horses, and liberating 40 \"prisoners.\" On the 31st, the battle continued to expand. More than 800 livestock and more than 9,000 stones of grain were obtained, and the livestock and all the grain were distributed to the local poor people.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th: After the People's Liberation Army moved into Tutai Village, on the east bank of the Hun River on the outskirts of Shenyang, in less than half an hour, many sallow-faced and emaciated hungry people came with bags to ask the People's Liberation Army to distribute grain. As soon as they saw the comrades of the People's Liberation Army, they excitedly said: \"My family hasn't had anything to cook for ten days.\" \"If you don't come, we'd rather rob grain and be beaten to death by the landlord than starve to death with our eyes open.\" Recently, we once voluntarily held a meeting to discuss organizing all the people who have no food to force the landlords to lend grain, but the landlords knew about it and organized a large regiment to monitor us in the village. Fortunately, you came quickly.\" On the same day, more than 2,000 stones of grain and floating wealth from the four big landlords in Tutai Village were divided among the poor people, who accounted for more than 80% of the village's population. The masses immediately organized stretcher teams and rushed to the battlefield to actively support the People's Liberation Army.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Under the powerful winter offensive of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, the Chiang bandits in Shenyang were panicked. According to foreign news agencies, the families of Chiang bandit officials and technicians continued to flee Shenyang by plane. Bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek flew to Shenyang in a hurry on the 10th to preside over the so-called \"emergency military meeting.\" Those attending the meeting included Fu Zuoyi, Chen Cheng, Du Yuming, Xiong Shihui, and other bandits.

    "content": "Landlords Infiltrate the Party to Oppress Hired and Poor Peasants\n  Overthrowing This Slab is the Only Way to Turn Things Around\n[Our Dispatch] A large portion of us poor people haven't thoroughly turned things around, and that's because we have a big slab weighing us down. Some landlords and rich peasants have infiltrated the Communist Party, become leaders of branches, shielding landlords, embezzling fruits of victory, and committing all kinds of evil. Some Party members who came from peasant backgrounds have been influenced by landlords and have forgotten their roots. These bad Party members are \"a swarm of bees,\" causing trouble so that even after more than a year of land reform, we still lack clothing and food and dare not speak out.\n\nIn Cixian County's Beiguo Village, there were seven Party members, four of whom were landlords. Although three were purged during rent and interest reduction, the landlords' power in the branch was not eliminated. Later, the number of Party members increased to ten (two poor peasants, five middle peasants, one landlord, and one rich peasant). Influenced by the 50-year-old clan struggle of landlords in the village, the branch was also divided into two factions, each protecting their landlord backers. When struggling against the landlord Du Laoshou of the western faction, the western faction members were dissatisfied and didn't move, while the eastern faction members were very \"active.\" When the western faction struggled against the eastern faction's landlord, Sun Chengxian, the chairman of the peasant association summoned the eastern faction members and said, \"Chengxian is one of our own, we must find a way to help him.\" So he was shielded and not struggled against. In Cixian County's Tianzhuang, a landlord infiltrated the branch and became the anti-deserter director. In the land reform, he not only shielded his own family but also his relatives. He himself was even allocated 48 mu of land and eight rooms. Seven bankrupt landlords and eleven rich peasants infiltrated this branch during the land reform. The power of the branch in Cixian County's Donggufuo Village was also controlled by landlords. The large landlord Zhang Fengge owned more than 1,300 mu of land before he divided his family. During the land reform, he \"donated\" more than 80 mu, and the branch said he was \"enlightened.\" The bully Li Weijin, who had forced people to death, was related to the branch secretary, and he was only lightly struggled against and then it was over.\n\nLi Mabao, a Party member in Wuxiang's Shuxin Village, became a big bully in the village. Shi Minglin, a dirt-poor, honorably discharged soldier who came from a shepherding background, was at odds with Li Mabao. He was allocated two rooms, but then they were taken away. However, Li Mabao's brother-in-law came to Shuxin from the first district, without any formal procedures, but was allocated a string of the best brick courtyards. Li Mabao, Zhao Hujiang, Liu Fuchang, Wang Zhenbiao, and other four major cadres took the lead in eating and drinking extravagantly when calculating the fruits of victory, consuming a total of 160,000 yuan. They came up with a new trick called \"handling fees,\" using the excuse of \"handling fees\" to seize a portion when the masses were distributing the fruits of victory. An old man was allocated a table, a wooden board, and a piece of clothing. The wooden board was taken by the cadres for official use, and the table was taken by the village head Liu Fuchang, saying it was a \"handling fee.\" The old man only received the piece of clothing. The poor peasant Chen Guoxing was allocated a big tree, and Li Mabao repeatedly sent people to buy it, but Guoxing refused to sell. Li Mabao then \"mobilized\" the \"masses\" to struggle against Guoxing, accusing him of embezzling as a representative. This caused Guoxing to be ruined. During the land reform, these \"four major cadres\" embezzled fruits of victory worth more than 700,000 yuan (excluding houses and land), accounting for 80% of the total fruits of victory. The old poor peasant Wang Jinmu liked to speak his mind and sometimes criticized the cadres. Li Mabao and his cohorts were very dissatisfied with him. During the land reform, Jinmu calculated his wages with the landlord, but the cadres forced Jinmu to return them to the landlord.\n\nIn Shexian County's Huaigeta Village, the branch secretary and peasant association chairman Dong Yongkuan, the public security officer Dong Fujiang, the civil education director Dong Luxiu, and the peasant association propagandist Dong Guanglu were all landlords. The village head Dong Jianxiang was a rich peasant. They controlled all the power in the village, embezzled the fruits of victory, and arbitrarily beat the masses. The masses gnashed their teeth at them, calling them life-threatening demons. The landlords who had personal grudges with them were struggled against, but Dong Yicheng, who was related to them, was classified as a middle peasant and not struggled against at all.\n\nThe Erlongmiao branch in Linxian County was ruled by middle peasants. The middle peasant Chen Wenxing was the village head and also the branch secretary. In the branch, there were fifteen people: three dirt-poor peasants, six poor peasants, one lower-middle peasant, four middle peasants, and one rich peasant. The ones with the most power were the middle peasants who had connections with landlords and rich peasants. Chen Wenxing led the struggle, saying that the landlords' remaining houses should be \"enough to live in\" and the remaining land should be \"enough to cultivate.\" When the masses wanted to beat the landlord, Chen Wenxing said, \"It's getting late, let's adjourn the meeting!\" The masses said that the struggle against the landlord Wang Fushan was not thorough enough. Chen Wenxing said that Wang Fushan had been robbed by bandits once and lost a lot of things. His father had silver dollars, died of a sudden illness, and Wang Fushan didn't know where the silver dollars were. Wang Fushan was a gambler and lost a lot of family property. When the masses went to Wang Fushan's house to move things during the struggle, Chen Wenxing said that you could only take one of two things, but if there was only one, you couldn't take it. When struggling against the feudal rich peasant Yan Jingyun, the women wanted to divide the spinning wheels and looms, but Chen Wenxing said, \"They still need to produce, let's quickly send them back.\"\n\nOur Opinion\nThis slab must be overthrown today. If this slab is not overthrown, we poor people cannot thoroughly defeat the landlords, we will have no food to eat, no clothes to wear, no houses to live in, and we cannot live a happy life with our wives and children. The Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China's Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Region has issued a letter to Party members to help us overthrow this slab. To overthrow this slab, we poor people must unite, not be afraid, not worry about face, criticize those bad elements who should be criticized, punish those who should be punished, eliminate the landlords and rich peasants who resolutely oppose us, and transform those who can still work for us. The world is created by us. As long as we all work together with one heart, we are sure to win.\n\nThose Party member cadres who have done bad things, you must know: your behavior is a serious mistake, a crime. Today, you should honestly listen to the people's judgment, be expelled if you should be expelled, and be punished if you should be punished. If you are not aware of this at this time, do not act in accordance with the Land Law, and continue to commit crimes, you will be severely punished by the Party and the people. As long as you stand on the side of the Party and the people, sincerely accept criticism and punishment, resolutely correct your mistakes, bow your heads to the people, and declare that you will obey the people and the Party in the future, the people and the Party still want you, and will treat you warmly, help you correct your mistakes, and continue to be hired laborers for the people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 地主钻到党内压迫雇贫　掀掉这块石板才能翻身\n\n1948-01-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　地主钻到党内压迫雇贫\n  　掀掉这块石板才能翻身\n    【本报消息】咱们穷人当中有好大一部分没有彻底翻身，就是因为咱们身上有一块大石板。有些地主、富农钻进共产党内，当了支部的领头人，包庇地主，贪污果实，无恶不作。有些农民出身的党员受了地主的影响，也忘了本。这些坏党员是“一窝蜂”，闹得土地改革进行了一年多，咱们仍然少衣缺食，不敢说话。\n    磁县北郭村七个党员，里面有四个地主。减租减息中虽然清洗了三个，但地主在支部中的权力并没有打掉。以后党员成了十个（两个贫农、五个中农、一个地主、一个富农），受村中五十年来地主宗派斗争的影响，支部也分成两个宗派，各保各的地主后台。斗争西派地主杜老寿时，西派党员不满不动，东派的党员很“积极”。西派斗争东派地主孙成先时，农会主任召集东派的人说：“成先好坏是自己的人，我们要给他想办法。”于是包庇下来没有斗。磁县田庄地主钻入支部，当了抗勤主任，在土地改革中不但包庇了他自己的家庭，还包庇了本家。他自己还分了四十八亩地、八间房子。有七个破产地主、十一个富农在土地改革中钻进了这个支部。磁县东古佛村支部的大权也操在地主手中，大地主张丰格没分家前占有土地一千三百多亩，在土地改革中“献”了八十多亩，支部就说他“开明”。曾逼死过人命的恶霸李维金和支部书记是本家，只轻轻的斗争了一下就算完事。\n    武乡树辛村党员李马保成了村里的大恶霸。放羊出身的赤贫、荣誉军人石明林和李马保不对，分了两间房子，以后又不给了。但是李马保的大舅子从一区到了树辛，没有什么正式手续，却分了一串最好的砖院。李马保、赵虎江、刘富昌、王振标等四大干部在算果实帐时领头大吃大喝，一共吃了十六万元。他们想出一种“经手费”的新花样，群众分果实时，他们借口“经手费”要霸占一部分。一个老人分到一张桌子、一块木板、一件衣服，木板被干部挂牌用了，桌子被村长刘富昌拿走了，说是“经手费”。这个老人就只得到了一件衣服。贫农陈国兴分到一棵大树，李马保三番五次着人去买，国兴不卖。李马保就“发动”“群众”斗争国兴，说他当代表贪污了。闹得国兴倾家荡产。在土地改革中，这“四大干部”贪污了果实价值七十多万（不算房屋和土地），占全部果实百分之八十。贫农王金木老汉爱说直理，有时也批评干部。李马保们对他很不满意，土地改革中金木向地主算出工资，干部们又强迫金木给地主退了回去。\n    涉县槐圪塔村的支部书记兼农会主任董永宽、公安员董福江、民教主任董禄秀、农会宣传董光禄都是地主，村长董建香是富农，他们掌握全村大权，贪污果实，随意吊打群众，群众对他们咬牙切齿，称他们为要命阎王。和他们有私仇的地主就斗争了，和他们有关系的董义成被他们划成中农，根本没有斗争。\n    林县二龙庙支部是中农当政。中农陈文兴是村长，又是支部书记。支部里十五个人，三个赤贫，六个贫农，一个下中农，四个中农，一个富农，顶有权力的是和地主富农有拉扯的中农。陈文兴领导斗争，给地主留的房子要“够住”，留的地要“够种”。群众要打地主时，陈文兴说：“天不早了，散会吧！”群众说地主王甫山斗争的不彻底，陈文兴说王甫山被土匪抢过一次，损失东西很多。他爹有现洋，得急病死了，王甫山不知道现洋在什么地方。王甫山好赌，输的家业不少。斗争时群众到王甫山家搬东西，陈文兴说有两样才能拿一样，有一样的不能拿。斗争封建富农阎景云时，妇女们要分纺花车、织布机，陈文兴说：“人家还要生产啦，快给人家送回去吧。”\n    　　　　我们的意见\n    这块石板，今天是非掀掉不可了，不掀掉这块石板，咱们穷人就不能彻底搞垮地主，就没有饭吃，没有衣穿，没有房住，就不能和老婆孩子在一起过痛快的日子。中国共产党晋冀鲁豫中央局发表了告党员书，就是为了帮助咱们掀掉这块石板。要掀掉这块石板，就得咱们穷人团结起来，不要害怕，不讲面子，对这些坏分子该批评的批评，该惩治的惩治，去掉坚决反对咱们的地主富农，改造还能给咱们办事的人。世界是咱们创造的，只要咱们大家一心的干，保险能得到胜利。\n    这些作了坏事的党员干部，你们要知道：你们的行为是严重的错误，是犯了罪的。今天应该老老实实的听从人民的处理，该开除的开除，该处分的处分。如果在这时候还不觉悟，不按土地法办事，继续犯罪，就要受到党和人民的严厉制裁。你们只要站在党和人民立场上，诚恳的接受批评处分，坚决的改正错误，向人民低头，声明今后服从人民服从党，人民和党还是要你们的，并热情相待，帮助你们改正错误，继续当人民的长工。"

In the past, some people felt that joining the Communist Party made them superior to the common people and allowed them to do whatever they wanted. Some Party members, after becoming village cadres, acted even more recklessly. Now, the Central Bureau has issued an order requiring all Party members to be open and transparent. The names of Party members must be made known to all farmers, so that the poor peasant leagues and farmers' associations can see who is suitable to be a Communist Party member and serve the poor, and who is not. Unsuitable Communist Party members must be expelled. Those who have made mistakes in the past must acknowledge and correct them, and those who have committed crimes must be convicted by the people's court. From now on, Party members will be supervised by the people. They must do whatever the poor peasant leagues and farmers' representatives decide. When dividing land now, no Party member can take more than their share, and they certainly cannot only take the good land. Those who have taken more in the past must return it. In the past, some Party members have sheltered landlord relatives and family members. Now, they must confess their mistakes, accept punishment, and anyone who does it again will be sent to the people's court to be punished. No matter what a Party member does, they must consult with the people and not force or take over everything. The Communist Party will rely on our farm laborers, poor peasants, and all farmers to supervise and educate their Party members.

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Cadres Must Be Honest About Their Mistakes\n  　Critique of \"Labor-Capital Cooperation\" in Mapingtou, Jincheng\n    ·Zhao Shuli·\n    On the thirteenth of this month, the People's Daily published a news item on the front page about the implementation of \"Labor-Capital Cooperation\" in Mapingtou Village, Jincheng, and pointed out that it was a grave error to consider the relationship between middle peasants and poor peasants as one between those selling labor and capitalists.\n\n    In addition to agreeing with the pointing out of this error, I feel that we should also trace it to its roots. The news item states that out of a total of one hundred and twenty-six households in the village, twenty-five are poor peasants, most of whom only have enough grain to eat for one month, which shows that they are extremely poor. In order to solve their difficulties, the entire village held a three-day conference, straightened out the thinking of the middle peasants, and then came up with this \"Labor-Capital Cooperation.\" Since the facts are like this, then we must ask: How was the \"filling the gaps and making up the differences\" movement carried out in Mapingtou Village over the past year? There are quite a few landlords and rich peasants in Mapingtou, have they been thoroughly struggled against? If they haven't been thoroughly struggled against, why not? If they have been thoroughly struggled against, to whom have the fruits been distributed? Why is it that even now, extremely poor households still account for one-fifth of the village? Why do these one-fifth of the households not have the qualifications to turn over and stand up, and even now can only engage in \"Labor-Capital Cooperation\" with the middle peasants? Is this the result of \"filling the gaps and making up the differences\"?\n\n    If the work of \"filling the gaps and making up the differences\" over the past year has not been done well, the village cadres should take responsibility, and cannot push the twenty-five holes to the middle peasants to fill. If all the landlords and rich peasants in the village have been thoroughly struggled against, and the poor peasants have all turned over and become middle peasants, and the remaining twenty-five extremely poor families are all village cadres, then naturally the masses can be mobilized to fill the gaps; if these twenty-five families are all from the masses, and the village cadres have either relaxed their grip on the landlords and rich peasants, or occupied too much of the fruits themselves, or distributed the fruits to another part of the people and forgot about these twenty-five families, then it cannot be said that the middle peasants and these twenty-five families can just engage in \"Labor-Capital Cooperation\" to call it quits.\n\n    Fortunately, the Land Law has been promulgated, and acting in accordance with the law can correct this error. How to do it, and who will do it, are stipulated in the Land Law. Poor peasants do not need to worry: in the future, when the Poor Peasants Association is organized, they will be the legal land distributors themselves, and will no longer have to fear being delayed by others. Middle peasants do not need to worry: acting in accordance with the Land Law, middle peasants will not be moved like anything -- those whose land is above the average will only take out a little land, those below the average will have to get a little land, and the floating wealth will not be touched at all, and they can also participate in the Peasants Association and become legal land distributors, and you will never be asked to take out things to engage in \"Labor-Capital Cooperation\" again. Village cadres, as long as they are not landlords and rich peasants who have taken advantage of the revolution, even if they have made some mistakes, as long as they are honest, they do not need to worry: those who have occupied too much of the fruits, as long as they honestly return them in accordance with the supplementary measures of the Land Law, will be fine; those who have relaxed their grip on the landlords and rich peasants, or have not taken comprehensive care of the distribution of fruits, in the future, the people who implement the Land Law will correct these mistakes for you, and will no longer pursue your responsibility. However, this requires you to be truly honest, and if you did not do a good job in \"filling the gaps and making up the differences,\" and now you want to play some tricks in implementing the Land Law to resist, then you have committed a crime and will be sent to the People's Court to be punished.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 干部有错要老实　评晋城马坪头“劳资合作”\n赵树理\n1948-01-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　干部有错要老实\n  　评晋城马坪头“劳资合作”\n    ·赵树理·\n    本月十三日，人民日报第一版登出晋城马坪头村实行“劳资合作”的消息，并且指出他把中农与贫雇的关系，算成出卖劳力的人与资本家的关系，是十分错误的。\n    我除同意指出这个错误以外，觉着还该追一追根。这消息里边说全村共一百二十六户，就有二十五户是贫雇，这二十五户，大部分只有能吃一个月的粮食，可见还是赤贫。为着给他们解决困难，全村开了三天大会，打通了一回中农思想，才弄成这个“劳资合作”。事实既是这样，那就要问：一年多的填平补齐运动，马坪头村是怎样做的？马坪头的地主富农并不算少，究竟斗透了没有？要是没有斗透为什么不斗？要是斗透了，果实都分给什么人了？为什么直到如今，赤贫户还占全村五分之一？为什么这五分之一的户口，没有翻身资格，直到如今还只能去和中农“劳资合作”？填平补齐的成绩就是这个吗？\n    这一年多的填平补齐工作没有作好，村干部应该负责，不能把二十五个窟窿推给中农去填。要是全村的地主富农都斗透了，贫雇都翻了身成了中农，余下的二十五家赤贫尽是些村干部，那自然可以发动群众来填补填补；要是这二十五家尽是群众，村干部或是放松了地主富农，或是自己多占了果实，或是把果实分给另一部分人忘了这二十五家，那就都不能叫中农和这二十五家来“劳资合作”一下算拉倒。\n    好在土地法公布出来了，照法办事，就可以纠正了这种错误。怎样做，谁来做，土地法上都有规定。赤贫户不用担心：将来组织贫农团，自己就是合法的分地人，再不要怕被别人耽搁了自己。中农不要担心：照土地法办事，中农跟不动一样——土地在平均数以上的只拿出一点地，在平均数以下的还要得一点地，浮财一点也不动，并且还能参加农会，当合法的分地人，绝不会再叫你拿出东西来搞“劳资合作”。村干部只要不是地主富农钻了革命的空子，虽然出了些错误，只要老实，也用不着担心：多占了果实的，只要照土地法补充办法老老实实退出来，就没了事；放松了地主富农的，或分果实没有照顾到全面的，将来执行土地法的人，会替你把这些错误改正了，也不再追究你的责任。不过这就得你真正老实，要是在填平补齐时候既然没把工作做好，到现在执行土地法又想捣点什么鬼，来抵抗抵抗，那就是犯了罪，就要送到人民法庭去受处分。"

The main force is concentrated on transportation, finding ways for livestock, but not finding ways and thinking about solutions for the poor and hired peasants who have not yet turned over. Problem considerations do not start from the interests of the poor and hired peasants. Some areas have grand-scale and brilliant achievements in the winter production movement, which need to be thoroughly checked. We must not be satisfied with some general calculations of achievements, but should focus on checking the guiding ideology of leading winter production. It also pointed out that the following work must be carried out at present: (1) First of all, loans must be concentrated and lent to poor and hired peasants. All the winter loans issued this winter and various loans in cash this year, as well as the inappropriately issued funds checked in the past, should be taken out and examined and approved by the loan committee of the poor and hired peasants who have not yet turned over, and concentratedly lent to the poor and hired peasants who have not yet turned over. (2) District and village cadres and cooperatives who borrow, use, encroach upon, or misappropriate loans must immediately take them all out and lend them to the poor and hired peasants who have not yet turned over. Otherwise, once found, they will be subject to disciplinary action and will not be forgiven. Village cadres must listen to the opinions of the poor and hired peasants when distributing loans, and must not exploit the poor and hired peasants or disrespect their interests. (3) In terms of methods, regardless of border areas, hinterland, old areas, or new areas, a top-down and bottom-up inspection of the winter production movement should be carried out without exception to check who are the people who have benefited greatly from this movement and who are the people who have not moved and have not benefited, and what are the reasons.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui Telegram: The anti-\"Keli Kong\" movement in the Jin Sui Daily and Xinhua General Branch has recently continued to advance due to the discovery of the problem of the accumulation of an important land reform communication, \"Poor Peasant Bachelor Zhang Hongnu Saved from Suicide.\" The manuscript reported that in the land reform in Huashuta Village, Baode, landlords and rich peasants spread rumors and slanders,污蔑张红奴不好好过光景 (defaming that Zhang Hongnu did not have a good life). When village cadres distributed disaster relief grain, they did not investigate and research, and did not allocate any to Zhang Hongnu. Middle peasants echoed the criticism, causing Zhang to become angry and attempt suicide by poisoning. Fortunately, the masses discovered it, and he was saved from death. The original manuscript was sent to the Communications Section of the General Branch in mid-August and forwarded to the Supplement Department of the newspaper, but it has been accumulated until now. In September, the author personally went to the newspaper to inquire, but the Communications Section requested the manuscript from the Supplement Department and did not receive it, and even deceived the author by saying \"it was not received.\" Later, because other comrades also criticized the problem of accumulating manuscripts, the manuscript was unearthed. For this reason, the Jin Sui Daily published a commentary entitled \"Further Develop the Anti-'Keli Kong' Movement,\" emphasizing: \"Especially in September, which was the period when we focused on reviewing leadership and internal affairs, this matter was overlooked. This shows how un-thorough our inspection of 'Keli Kong' is, and it fully exposes how serious the problems are in our work's stance and style.\" The commentary finally pointed out: After September 18, the anti-\"Keli Kong\" movement of the newspaper and the General Branch naturally merged with the \"investigation of class, investigation of stance, and investigation of thought.\" While this movement has just begun to deepen, it has already proven that only in this way can problems be better discovered, and can one move from unconsciousness to consciousness, from the consciousness of a few to the consciousness of the majority. Without the consciousness of the majority, the anti-\"Keli Kong\" cannot be thoroughly carried out. The supplement editor, Hu Zheng, wrote a self-criticism stating that the manuscript was suppressed because: \"I did not attach great importance to every manuscript about land reform from the standpoint of poor and hired peasants, and I did not treat everything that poor and hired peasants encountered as if I had encountered it myself. I did not regard the Party newspaper as the mouthpiece of the poor and hired peasants, speaking up and supporting the poor and hired peasants.\" Chen Channing of the Communications Section also wrote a self-criticism saying: \"This is because I was afraid of self-criticism, afraid of openly admitting mistakes to the author, and lacked the courage to do so. Therefore, I did not hesitate to use deception to cover up mistakes, forgetting the responsibility that a Party newspaper worker should have towards the author.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋绥日报继续检查“客里空”　反对积压土地改革稿件\n\n1948-01-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋绥日报继续检查“客里空”\n  　反对积压土地改革稿件\n    【新华社晋绥电】此间晋绥日报、新华总分社反“客里空”运动，最近由于发现重要土地改革通讯“贫农单身汉张红奴服毒得救”一稿被积压之问题而继续推进。该稿系报导保德化树塔村土地改革中，地主富农造谣挑拨，污蔑贫农张红奴不好好过光景，村干部于分救灾粮时，未调查研究，送不分给张红奴，中农又随声附和批评，致张气愤服毒，幸为群众发觉，始免于死。原稿自八月中旬寄到总分社通讯科转交报社副刊部后，即被积压至今。九月间作者曾亲自到报社探讯，但通讯科向副刊部索稿未获，竟以“没有收到”予以哄骗。后因其他同志亦对压稿问题提出批评，该稿始被发掘出来。为此晋绥日报特以“再深入开展反‘客里空’运动”为题发表评论，着重指出：“特别是九月，正是我们着重检讨领导和内勤的时期，然而这件事竟被漏过，这说明我们对‘客里空’的检查是何等的不深入，这充分暴露了我们工作中的立场与作风，存在的问题是何等严重”。评论最后指出：九月十八日以后，报社、总分社的反“客里空”运动，自然而然地和“查阶级、查立场、查思想”融合起来了。还在这一运动刚刚开始深入中，已经证明只有这样才能更好的发现问题，才能从不自觉到自觉，从少数人的自觉到大多数人的自觉。如果没有大多数人的自觉，反“客里空”是反不能彻底的。副刊编辑胡正为文检讨该稿被压称：“自己不是以贫雇农的立场，十分重视关于土改的每一稿件，没有把贫雇农所遭遇到的一切就象自己所遭遇的一样，不是把党报当做贫雇农的喉舌，为贫雇农说话撑腰。”通讯科陈蝉鸣亦为文检讨说：“这是害怕自我批评，害怕对作者公开的承认错误，缺乏勇气，因此不惜用欺骗手段来掩盖错误，忘记了一个党报工作者对作者应负的责任。”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, 12th. During the Haiyang siege, the support-the-front supply cooperatives organized in various districts near the battlefield created a new form of wartime supply that benefited both the military and the people, enabling timely solutions to the needs of the troops and facilitating purchases by the masses, stabilizing wartime prices. The cooperative was formed by a working group composed of the county government's Industry and Commerce Section, the Chamber of Commerce, and shops, under the unified leadership of the county's Support-the-Front Office. The original district-level cooperative was the central cooperative, and village support-the-front supply cooperatives were established by organizing the capital of various village cooperatives and merchants. Each district reported market conditions and inventory numbers daily for mutual adjustment, exchanging surplus goods for those in short supply. Items that were difficult to procure were wholesaled by supplier shops to the central cooperatives. The central cooperatives retained a portion and then distributed the rest to the village supply cooperatives at the original price. Locally produced items were purchased by the village supply cooperatives, distributed among households, and concentrated as needed. In this way, even though they were ten or twenty li away from the front line, aerial clearing was not affected. If troops were stationed in villages with cooperatives, the cooperatives served as the natural supply cooperative. If the supply could not meet the demand, adjustments were made at the central cooperative. The central cooperative headquarters were mostly located in the rear of the troops. Due to the establishment of this type of supply cooperative, during the siege of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Haiyang last year, cellophane noodles fell from 1,500 yuan to 1,200 yuan per catty, kerosene fell from 2,400 yuan to 2,000 yuan per catty, and the prices of other items remained stable.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 海阳围困战中　创造战地支前供应社\n\n1948-01-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　海阳围困战中\n  　创造战地支前供应社\n    【新华社华东十二日电】海阳围困战中，战地附近各区组织之支前供应社，曾创造了军民两利的战时供应新形式，使部队所需能及时得到解决，并便利群众购买，稳定战时物价。该社由县府实业科、商会、商店联合组成工作组，统一在县支前办事处的领导下，以原区联社为中心社，并组织各村合作社及商人的资本，成立村支前供应社。各区每天汇报行情及存货数目，以便互相调剂，以货物剩余部分换回不足部分。不易采办之物品，由供应商店批发给各中心社，除中心社留一部分外，再按原价发给村供应社。当地出产的物品，由村供应社买好，分散在各户，随要随集中。这样虽离火线一、二十里，亦不影响空中清野。如部队住在有合作社的村庄，合作社即为当然供应社。如供不应求，即到中心社调剂。中心社社址大都设于部队后方所在地。由于这种供应社的建立，在去年海阳蒋匪被围期间，粉条由每斤一千五百元落至一千二百元，火油由每斤两千四百元落至二千元，其他物品，均保持原价。"

The story is as follows: During the conscription movement last November, the masses in each group were brewing the idea that \"the political director should join the army,\" but no one dared to mobilize him. Later, Duan Pianyou and two others were willing to join the army and challenged Duan Bingnan. Pianyou's father said, \"Shouldn't Duan Bingnan join the army? Considering the number of brothers (he has three), he should go. Considering the example set by cadres, he should also go.\" (He had signed up for the army three times in the past, but he was just lying and never went.) At the meeting, the masses proposed, \"We are all willing to join the army and request the political director (i.e., the branch secretary) to lead us together.\" Duan Bingnan arrogantly said, \"I will not lead you rabble.\" The masses raised a stern question: \"What is your thinking if you don't join the army? If you don't want to go, who will you mobilize? Will our village's conscription work be done or not?\" Duan Bingnan unreasonably said, \"I will not join the army. I have two and a half jin to rely on (referring to his head). My thinking is not as good as a backward person. If the conscription work is not done, then it is completed.\" After Duan finished speaking, everyone was very angry. Comrade Yang Erxi, a district cadre, believed that this situation affected the conscription work and immediately detained Duan.\n    After Duan was detained, the masses' concerns were: \"Now that he is detained, after the new soldiers leave, he will still be the political director and will definitely retaliate, and we will still be bullied.\" Therefore, they were still unwilling to actively carry out the conscription work. Later, the district office decided that this time it must protect the democratic rights of the masses and support the masses. District Chief Wang personally went to Shidong to announce to the masses: \"Duan Bingnan's problem will be completely handled by the masses. Whether he will be a cadre in the future will be decided by the masses.\" In the summary of the conscription meeting, the masses proposed: Duan Bingnan must be dismissed because he has done too many bad things. In the struggle last spring, the emancipated peasant Duan Xianghua bought a house in the same courtyard as Duan Bingnan. Duan Bingnan wanted to occupy it exclusively, so he sent the head of the peasants' association to talk to Duan Xianghua: \"Exchange your house for the house of the political director's uncle (whose property belonged to Duan Bingnan after his death). If you are unwilling to exchange, Duan Bingnan said that you delivered eggs to the Japanese in Yetao Village in the past, so you have a problem.\" Duan Xianghua was unwilling to exchange and cried all night in anger. Later, a public security officer also went to threaten him, saying, \"Exchange it with them, or it will be terrible.\" Duan Xianghua was forced and had no choice but to exchange houses. When the village distributed the fruits of struggle, it was not decided by the masses' discussion. At the meeting, Duan Bingnan said that whoever he wanted to give it to, he would give it to. Zhang Shutang, the head of the cooperative, was a Communist Party member of hired worker origin. Seeing this bad behavior, he criticized him. Duan Bingnan arrogantly said, \"I am the branch secretary. I am solely responsible for whether the work is done well or badly.\" In the leveling and replenishment work, Duan Tianchu said in private, \"Why do the cadres get more fruits of victory than us?\" After Duan Bingnan found out, he \"mobilized\" a small number of people to attack him, saying that he was disrupting and sabotaging, and wanted to beat him and hang him up. Zhang Shutang begged the masses to intercede for him, and he was not beaten. As a result, Duan Bingnan decided: \"Duan Tianchu is fined to return all the fruits of struggle he was given, and he is forbidden to attend meetings and speak for twenty days.\" Duan Bingnan was a declining rich peasant. In the struggle, he pretended to be a poor peasant and was given more than ten mu of good land and a good house. He was in charge of various accounts such as village finances and the fruits of struggle. The masses discussed one after another: \"Duan Bingnan doesn't work hard, why can he eat and dress well, and buy a big donkey?\" As a result, after auditing the accounts of the fruits of victory that he managed, he embezzled more than 60,000 yuan. Last August, the cooperative sold two donkeys. He deliberately set the price very low. The method of buying was for households without donkeys to decide by drawing paper balls. Whoever got it would buy it. A total of six people bought it. Duan Bingnan secretly colluded with four people to draw paper balls for him. Under his manipulation, he bought a big donkey. He was involved in corruption with the family member of a soldier fighting the enemy [抗属]. The masses raised opinions, asking him to confess and reflect, and said that if he reflected well, he could still participate in the peasants' association. If he did not reflect well, he would temporarily withdraw from the peasants' association. Duan Bingnan was unwilling to reflect, but arrogantly said, \"That's just how I think.\" The masses decided to temporarily expel him from the peasants' association and return the donkey he bought at a low price.\n    The district office expressed its full agreement and support for the opinions of the masses in Shidong. Comrade Zhang Xiuliang, the district secretary, said: \"We are determined to let the masses impeach and transform bad cadres like Duan Bingnan, and we will never tolerate them.\" (Fang Dong)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 石洞支书横行霸道　群众起来将他罢免\n方动\n1948-01-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　石洞支书横行霸道\n  　群众起来将他罢免\n    【本报消息】武安石洞村支部书记段炳南，贪污果实，欺侮群众，这次又拒绝参军，老百姓起来当了一次家，把他罢免了。事情的经过是：去年十一月参军运动中，各组群众都酝酿：“政治主任应当去参军”，但谁也不敢去动员他。后来段偏有等三人愿去参军，提出和段炳南挑战；偏有爹说：“段炳南就不应该去参军吗？论兄弟多少（他兄弟三个）他应当去，论干部带头他也应当去”。（他过去曾三次报名参军，但都是骗人，始终未去。）在大会上群众提出：“我们都愿意参军，要求政治主任（即支部书记）带领我们一同去”。段炳南傲慢地说：“我就不带领你们这伙群众。”群众提出严正质问：“你不参军是啥思想？你不愿去，动员谁去，咱村的参军工作还做不做？”段炳南蛮不讲理地说：“我就不去参军，我有二斤半顶着（指头），我的思想还不如一个落后群众，参军工作不做就算完成。”段讲完后，大家很气愤，区干杨二喜同志认为这种情况影响参军工作，立即将段扣起。\n    段被扣后，群众的思想顾虑是：“现在把人家扣着，新战士走后，人家还是政治主任，一定要报复，咱们还得受欺压。”因此仍不愿积极进行参军工作。后由区署决定，这次一定要保障群众的民主权利，给群众撑腰。王区长并亲自去石洞向群众宣布：“段炳南的问题，完全交群众处理，今后他当不当干部，由群众决定。”在总结参军会议中，群众提出：段炳南必须撤职，因为他办的坏事太多了。去年春天斗争中，翻身农民段祥华买了一座房子，和段炳南同院，段炳南想独占，便派农会主任和段祥华谈：“你的房子和政治主任伯父（年老死后财产是段炳南的）房子换一下，你若不愿换，段炳南说过去你给冶陶村日本人送过鸡蛋，有问题。”段祥华不愿换，气得哭了一夜。后来公安员也去威胁说：“和人家换吧，不换不得了。”段祥华被迫无法，只得换房。村里分斗争果实，不是群众评议的，在大会上段炳南说分给谁就分给谁。合作社长张书堂是雇工出身的共产党员，看到这种恶劣行为，曾批评过他，段炳南骄傲地说：“我是支部书记，工作做好做坏，由我一人负责。”填平补齐中，段天初背地说：“干部分的果实，为啥都比咱们多？”段炳南知道后“发动”少数群众攻击他，说他破坏捣乱，要打他吊他。张书堂向群众哀求说情，才算没有被打，结果段炳南决定：“罚段天初把分的斗争果实全部退出来，并且罚他二十天不准开会说话。”段炳南是一个破落的富农，他在斗争中冒充贫民，分好地十余亩，好房一座，他管着村财政、斗争果实等各种帐目。群众纷纷议论：“段炳南不好好劳动，为啥能吃好穿好，还买个大驴？”结果把他管的果实帐清算后，贪污六万余元。去年八月合作社卖两个驴，他故意把价格订得很低，买的办法是没驴户拿纸蛋决定，谁拿着谁买，共有六个人买，段炳南就暗中串通四个人替他拿纸蛋，在他操纵下，买到一个大驴。他和抗属××搞腐化，群众提出意见，要他坦白反省，并说反省的好，让他仍然参加农会，若不好好反省就暂时退出农会。段炳南不愿反省，反而傲慢地说：“我的思想就是这样。”群众决定把他暂时开除农会，并将他贱价买的驴退回。\n    区署对石洞群众的意见表示十分赞同与支持，区书张秀亮同志说：“我们对段炳南这样的坏干部，下决心让群众去罢免他改造他，决不姑息。”（方动）"

    "content": "Preliminary Reflection on the Report of Zhai Shixian Donating Land\n\n　　Comrade Zhang Yiying has already exposed the [Truth about Zhai Shixian's Land Donation] (see this newspaper, October 4th of last year). The reason for mentioning it again here is that the news was originally written by us, with the help of Comrade Shi Hong, in consultation with Comrade Wang Tingdong, but more importantly, the parts of the draft where they were correct were deleted by us, for which we take full responsibility.\n\n　　The facts of the matter are as follows: When we saw the news of land donations in Central China, we thought, \"We can't create this kind of new thing, but it would be good to keep up in time.\" So, we tried to find clues for this kind of news. The starting point of this idea was to be the first, and the first thing we considered was not standing on the side of the peasants, how to serve the peasants' just struggle, but according to bourgeois journalistic views, how to write a \"beautiful news\" to show our work performance. Also, because we did not firmly stand on the side of the peasants, we unconsciously twisted to the landlord's side. With the wrong stance, a series of mistakes followed.\n\n　　At that time, Comrade Shi Hong was a reporter for the Taihang Xinhua Daily, and was temporarily under the guidance of the general branch, and was interviewing in Boyan. When we got the clue that the peasants in Boyan were clearing accounts with Zhai Shixian, we suggested that Comrade Shi Hong and Comrade Wang Tingdong, secretary of Wu'an County, discuss whether the problem of Zhai could be solved by donating land, so that a piece of news could be generated. In the draft written by Comrade Shi Hong and read by Comrade Wang Tingdong, there was originally a process of how Zhai Shixian confronted the masses and then \"consciously thought\" and took out things. We considered that with this process of first being bad and then being good, it would not be in line with the spirit of \"praise\", the publicity and education significance would not be greater, and the news would not be perfect enough, so we deleted this process. In this way, Zhai Shixian, a landlord element who resolutely opposed the peasants, was written as an \"excellent Communist Party member.\"\n\n　　This irresponsible, fact-distorting \"Kremlin\" style comes from our own landlord and bourgeois ideology. For a considerable period, we have not made efforts to positively promote the just actions of the peasants, but fantasized about using the method of \"land donation\" to solve the family problems of cadres and party members from landlord backgrounds, and fantasized that some landlords could \"automatically become enlightened\"; we wanted to replace struggle and liquidation with \"peaceful solutions\", which greatly facilitated the resistance and loopholes of the landlords. We ourselves were born in the exploiting class, and we did not have real hatred for the landlords, on the contrary, after the struggle deepened, we had a certain degree of pity; we did not have real love and emotion for the peasants, and even suspected that their actions against party cadres from landlord backgrounds were somewhat \"excessive\"; supported by this kind of thinking and emotion, we praised the landlords and attacked the peasants in the news.\n\n　　The news showed some landlord class views, such as Zhai Shixian said in his letter to the Wu'an County Party Committee: \"I am willing to donate 'my own' fields and houses to the hardworking peasants.\" Zhai is a big landlord in Boyan, and all his property is derived from the exploitation of the blood and sweat of the peasants, and it is by no means his \"own\" fields and property. The so-called \"donating to the hardworking peasants\" means giving \"one's own\" things to others, so the peasants' struggle becomes unreasonable. We ourselves actually had this wrong consciousness, so we retained this sentence and helped him insult the peasants.\n\n　　This rectification of the party's news team has made us begin to realize the connection between the \"Kremlin\" style and landlord thinking, and its harm to the people's cause is extremely serious. We will continue to reflect and gradually correct it in our work, and strive to be a farmhand for the peasants.\n　　(Angang, Lizhuang)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 翟士贤献田报导初步反省\n安岗　李庄\n1948-01-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　翟士贤献田报导初步反省\n    【翟士贤献田真象】，张一英同志已经揭发过了（见去年十月四日本报）。这里所以要再说的，乃因该消息原由我们推动史洪同志商同王庭栋同志写成，更重要的是底稿中他们对的地方被我们删掉了，这完全由我们负责。\n    事实的原委是这样：我们看到华中献田的消息，想到：“我们就不能创造这种新东西，能及时配合也不错。”于是就设法寻觅这类新闻的线索。这种想法的出发点是抢先，首先考虑的不是站在农民立场上，怎样服务于农民的正义斗争，而是根据资产阶级新闻观点，考虑怎样写一篇“漂亮新闻”，以表现自己的工作成绩。又由于没有坚决站在农民的立场，不自觉的扭到了地主方面。立场错了，下面跟着产生了一连串的错误。\n    当时史洪同志是太行新华日报记者，工作上临时受总分社指导，正在伯延采访。我们得到伯延农民正清算翟士贤的线索，便建议史洪同志和武安县书王庭栋同志商量，可否用献田的方法解决翟的问题，如此就可产生一篇新闻了。由史洪同志写成、王庭栋同志看了的底稿中本来有翟士贤如何与群众对抗，进而“思想自觉”，拿出东西的过程，我们考虑有了这个先坏后好的过程，反倒不合于“表扬”的精神，宣传教育意义不会更大，新闻会显得不够完美，于是把这个过程删掉了。这样就把翟士贤这个坚决反对农民的地主分子，写成了“优秀的共产党员”。\n    这种不负责任，歪曲事实的“客里空”作风，是从我们自己的地主、资产阶级思想产生的。我们在相当长的时期中，没有著力的正面鼓吹农民的正义行动，却幻想用“献田”的方法解决地主出身的干部党员的家庭问题，幻想某些地主能够“自动开明”；我们想用“和平解决”代替斗争清算，结果大大的便利了地主的抵抗和钻空子。我们自己出身于剥削阶级，对地主没有真正的仇恨，相反的在斗争深入以后倒有某种程度的怜悯情绪；对农民没有真正的热爱和感情，甚至怀疑他们对地主出身的党员干部的行动是否有些“过火”；被这种思想和情绪支持着，于是在新闻中表扬了地主，打击了农民。\n    新闻中表现了某些地主阶级观点，如翟士贤在给武安县委的信中说：“我愿将‘自己的’田产房屋，献给勤劳的农民”。翟是伯延大地主，其财产全系剥削农民血汗而来，绝不是什么他“自己的”田产。所谓“献给勤劳的农民”，意思是把“自己的”东西给了人家，于是农民的斗争就成了不合理。我们自己实际上也有这种错误意识，所以把这种字句也给保留下来，帮助他侮辱了农民。\n    这次整顿党的新闻队伍中，使我们开始认识了“客里空”作风与地主思想的联系，他给人民事业的危害是极端严重的。我们将继续反省，并在工作中逐步纠正，勉作农民一个长工。  　　（安岗、李庄）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. Weekly battle situation (8th to 14th). In 1947, the People's Liberation Army won great victories in the northern and southern battlefields, foreshadowing that 1948 will be a year of even greater victories.\n    The Northeast People's Liberation Army took a great victory of annihilating three enemy divisions and one army headquarters as the beginning of this year's great victory. Following the Liaoxi Zhangwu campaign before the eve of the Lunar New Year, in which one whole division of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits was annihilated, the People's Liberation Army surrounded the enemy's New Fifth Army Headquarters and the 195th and 43rd Divisions between Xinmin and Gongzhutun outside Shenyang on the 5th. The PLA soldiers charged and fought valiantly in the icy and snowy weather, and finally completely annihilated the enemy in Anfutun, Huangjiashan and other areas on the 7th, totaling more than 16,000 enemy troops. Chen Linda, commander of the New Fifth Army, and the two division commanders, two deputy division commanders, and two chiefs of staff of the army were all captured. The entire battle lasted only 54 hours. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits concentrated fifteen divisions to reinforce, but they were blocked by us on the arc-shaped front of 160 li west of the Shen (yang) Shi (foshan) highway, and they never crossed our predetermined blocking line, and lost more than 4,000 people.\n    In this Shenyang outer regiment campaign, bandit leader Chen Cheng concentrated the maximum of half of his entire forty-four divisions in an attempt to make a desperate gamble, but in just 54 hours, his entire deployment was shattered by the People's Liberation Army, which shows the unprecedented strength of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, while Chiang Kai-shek's bandits have reached the end of their road. This campaign also marks the beginning of the People's Liberation Army concentrating greater forces in a region to carry out larger-scale annihilation battles in the future, and accelerating the victorious situation of finally liberating the entire Northeast, going south to the Beining Line, and directly cooperating with the fraternal troops in the Guannei.\n    On the southern front: since the Pinghan Longhai Campaign, our three major People's Liberation Armies have met and cooperated in a wide area. Chiang Kai-shek's main forces were either annihilated or beaten to the point of fleeing east and west in a panic, forcing Chiang Kai-shek to transfer the \"key defense\" troops from the Dabie Mountains to aid the north. Chiang Kai-shek's entire deployment in the Central Plains was disrupted, while the People's Liberation Army completely grasped the strategic initiative and freely chose battle opportunities. Our Hubei-Henan-Anhui army took advantage of the victory to divide its forces and go south, and attacked Suixian County in broad daylight on the 7th, cooperating with the central front army advancing from Mianyang to penetrate the far rear of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits on both sides of the Hanshui River, linking the Jianghan Liberated Area with the Tongbai Liberated Area. Now, a vast area of 700 li in length and width, from An(lu) Ying(shan) in the east to Xiang(yang) Jing(men) in the west, Sui(xian) Zao(yang) in the north, and Mian(yang) Jian(li) in the south, with a population of three million, has been liberated, and the Hanshui River has been blocked, cutting off the Han(kou) Bao(ji) highway, and dividing the water and land connections between Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Sichuan and Shaanxi.\n    Since the Hubei-Henan-Anhui, Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui, and Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei three major People's Liberation Armies launched their counter-offensive, they have annihilated more than 160,000 enemy and puppet troops in four months. Now, not only have they gained a firm foothold, but they have also opened up a vast battlefield of more than a thousand li in length and width. The area that was once the heart of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits has now become our new liberated area, and the consolidation and expansion of the new area has laid a solid foundation for the People's Liberation Army to launch another strategic deployment.\n    Chiang Kai-shek, due to the successive failures of the battles on various fronts, flew to Han and Shen during the week in a panic, as anxious as ants on a hot pot, while Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency fabricated the \"victory\" in Western Liaoning. All these only completely exposed Chiang Kai-shek's increasingly deepening military crisis and serious defeat.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 一周综合战况\n\n1948-01-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　一周综合战况\n    【新华社陕北十四日电】一周战况（八日至十四日）。一九四七年解放军在南北各战场上接连赢得了伟大的胜利，预示着一九四八年将为取得更伟大胜利的一年。\n    东北解放军以歼敌三个整师和一个军部的大捷，作为今年伟大胜利的开端。继除夕前辽西彰武战役，歼灭蒋匪一个整师后，解放军复于五日在沈阳门外新民与公主屯间包围敌新五军军部及一九五、四三两个师，解放军勇士在冰天雪地中纵横冲杀，七日终在安福屯、黄家山一带将敌彻底干净全部歼灭，计歼上述敌军共一万六千余人。新五军军长陈林达及该军的两个师长、两个副师长、两个参谋长以下无一漏网。是役前后仅历五十四小时。蒋匪曾集中十五个师增援，但被我阻击于沈（阳）石（佛寺）公路以西长达百六十里的孤形阵线，始终未能越过我预定阻击线一步，且折损四千余人。\n    在这次沈阳外团战役中，匪首陈诚最大限度地集中其全部四十四个师的一半兵力，企图作孤注一掷，但仅在五十四小时内，其整个部署即被解放军打得支离破碎，这说明东北解放军的空前强大，而蒋匪则已穷途末路。这次战役更标志着解放军今后在一个地区内集中更大兵力进行更大规模歼灭战的开端，并加速推进最后解放全东北，南下北宁线，直接配合关内兄弟部队作战的胜利形势。\n    南线方面：自平汉陇海战役后，我三大解放军在广大地区会师并协同作战，蒋匪主力不是被消灭就是被打得东窜西逃焦头烂额，逼使蒋贼不得不抽调大别山“重点防卸”部队北援。蒋匪在中原的整个部署全被打乱，而解放军则完全掌握战略主动，自由选择战机。我鄂豫皖大军即曾乘胜分兵南下，于七日白昼奔袭，攻克随县，策应中线由沔阳挺进的大军，打入汉水两岸的蒋匪远后方，使江汉解放区与桐柏解放区连成一片。现东起安（陆）应（山），西迄襄（阳）荆（门），北至随（县）枣（阳），南至沔（阳）监（利），拥有三百万人口的纵横七百里的广大地区已获解放，并遮断汉水，截断汉（口）宝（鸡）公路，割裂了蒋匪川陕的水陆联系。\n    鄂豫皖、苏鲁豫皖和豫陕鄂三大解放军自出师反攻以来，四个月内已歼灭敌伪十六万人以上，现在不但已站稳脚跟，而且开辟了纵横千余里的辽阔战场，过去蒋匪心脏的地带，现已变为我之新解放区，而新区的巩固和扩大，又为解放军另次战略展开打下巩固的基础。\n    蒋贼因各线战事的接连失败，周内曾仓惶飞汉沈两地，急得象油锅上的蚂蚁，而蒋匪中央社复捏造辽西“胜利”，所有这些只不过是完全暴露蒋匪日益加深的军事危机与严重的败局而已。"

    "date": "1948-01-16",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 14th: The Northeast Daily recently published an editorial titled \"Striving to Complete the Great Historical Task – Celebrating the Great Victory of Shenbei and the Central Work of 1948.\" The editorial first extended its highest respect to all commanders and fighters who fought resolutely in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius. It then pointed out the significant meaning of this great victory, saying:\n\t\"Our army's powerful winter offensive was a continuous battle fought in extremely harsh and cold weather. It was a battle directly knocking on the gate of the enemy's nest, Shenyang, and it was conducted under highly centralized forces and unified direct command. Therefore, its scale of operations and victory results far exceeded all previous battles. Moreover, as our army's edge was initially tested in this campaign, it successively captured key towns such as Beipiao, Heishan, Dahushan, and Zhangwu. From then on, the strategic connection between our army's eastern and western battlefields was greatly opened up. The victorious conclusion of the battle of Gongzhutun further created an unprecedented large-scale convergence of our Northeast army on one battlefield. From now on, our army will be able to maneuver more freely and conduct large-scale concentrated operations, laying a solid foundation for completely eliminating the enemy forces in the Northeast in the future, advancing victoriously towards the Beining Line, and coordinating with the People's Liberation Army inside the pass to annihilate a large number of enemies.\"\n\tThe editorial then discussed the dead end of the Chiang bandits in the Northeast and their inevitable fate of defeat, saying: \"The great victory of this campaign also shows the precarious and doomed state of the Chiang Chen bandit army in the Northeast. When our army directly approached the enemy's nest, Shenyang, with unprecedentedly powerful forces, the 'dormant state' of the Northeast battlefield envisioned by the bandit chief Chen Cheng failed. He showed even more panic than during the autumn offensive and had to exhaust all his reserves. Among the forty-four divisions of his total force, he concentrated twenty divisions of troops, gathered around the periphery of Shenyang, and vainly attempted to stake everything on a single battle to save his dying fate. However, in the battle of Gongzhutun, two entire divisions and one military headquarters were completely annihilated, and ten divisions were beaten into headlong flight. All the enemy's struggles ended in a disastrous defeat. The fate of the enemy forces, who are now shrinking into a few towns, is firmly in the hands of the people of the Northeast and their sons and daughters in the army. This situation is becoming increasingly clear.\"\n\tThe editorial finally pointed out that the sacred and glorious task before the entire Party and army in the Northeast is not only to annihilate more Chiang bandit troops in the Northeast and end the evil rule of \"Second Manchuria\" within 1948, liberating the people of the Northeast, but also to support the national liberation war with constantly increasing manpower and material resources, and to make the new Northeast, with its abundant human resources, the general base for the national liberation war. To this end, the Northeast Daily called on the entire Party, army, and people of the Northeast to do the following central tasks well: (1) Implement land reform and complete the equal distribution of land in the basic liberated areas and newly recovered areas within six months. (2) Fully build the army and boldly expand the main force. (3) Train a large number of cadres, drawing as many cadres as possible from the basic liberated areas to help the masses in the newly recovered areas to stand up and mobilize the masses; organize large-scale work teams to participate in field work with the army; and various military and political cadre schools should train a large number of cadres needed for combat and training. (4) Strengthen the workers' movement in cities, railways, and mines in the liberated areas, mobilize and organize workers to develop production to serve the war and serve the countryside. Call on urban industrialists and businessmen to strive to produce for military and civilian needs. (5) Mobilize and organize millions of people to complete and exceed the 1948 economic construction plan and develop military and civilian industries. Financially, we must achieve further unification and concentration and ensure sufficient military needs. Party, government, military, and civilian institutions in the rear, including county and district armed forces, must solve the task of partial or major self-sufficiency through agricultural production. (6) Rectify the ideological and work style within the Party. The editorial encouraged the Party, government, army, and people in the front and rear of the Northeast to be a hundred times more ambitious, courageous and determined to make persistent efforts, work together, and continuously move from victory to victory to complete the great and glorious task.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 今年要结束“二满洲”的统治　东北日报祝沈北大捷\n\n1948-01-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　今年要结束“二满洲”的统治\n  　东北日报祝沈北大捷\n    【新华社东北十四日电】东北日报顷发表社论，题为“为完成伟大的历史任务而奋斗——庆祝沈北大捷和一九四八年的中心工作”：社论首对本次冒零下三十度严寒，坚忍作战的全体指战员致崇高敬意，次即指出本次大捷的重大意义说：\n    “我军此次强大的冬季攻势，是在冒着极恶劣的严寒气候下连续作战，是直叩敌巢沈阳大门的作战，是在兵力高度集中和统一直接指挥之下进行作战。因此其作战规模和胜利战果，都远远超过前此一切战役，而且由于这一战役中我军的锋刃初试，便连下北票、黑山、打虎山以及彰武诸重镇，从此就使得我军东西两大战场的战略联系大为贯通，而公主屯一役的胜利结束，更造成东北我军在一个战场上取得空前大汇合；从此我军更能机动自如大规模的集中作战，打下了今后全部消灭东北敌军，并向北宁线胜利进军，配合关内解放军大量歼敌的胜利基础。”\n    社论继即论述东北蒋匪的穷途末路及其必败的命运说：“这一战役的伟大胜利，同时也显示出东北蒋陈匪军摇摇欲坠的穷途末路。当此次我军以空前强大兵力，直逼敌巢沈阳之时，匪首陈诚所幻想的东北战场的‘休眠状态’落了空，表现了较秋季攻势时更为惊慌失措，不得不竭其全部后备力量，在其全部总兵力的四十四个师中，集中了二十个师的部队，集结沈阳外围，妄图孤注一掷，与我决一雌雄，以挽救其垂死的命运。然而公主屯一战，竟落得两个整师和一个军部的全军覆没，十个师被打得抱头鼠窜，敌军的一切挣扎，都归于惨败。今后龟缩少数城镇的敌军，他们的命运是紧紧的掌握在东北人民及其子弟兵的手里，这情景是愈来愈益显明了。”\n    社论最后指出：东北全党全军面前神圣而光荣的任务，就是不仅要在一九四八年之内，更大的歼灭东北蒋匪军，结束“二满洲”的罪恶统治，解放东北人民；而且要以不断增加的人力物力，支援全国解放战争，要把人力资源雄厚的新东北，成为全国解放战争的总基地。为此，东北日报号召东北全党全军全体人民必须做好以下的几项中心工作，就是：（一）贯彻土地改革，要在半年内完成基本解放区和新收复区的平分土地。（二）全力建军，放手壮大主力。（三）大量培养干部，要从基本解放区尽量抽调干部，到新收复区帮助群众翻身，发动群众；组织大规模的工作团，随军参加战地工作；各军政干部学校，要大量训练作战练兵所需的各种干部。（四）加强解放区城市铁路、矿山的职工运动，动员和组织工人发展生产为战争服务，为农村服务。号召城市工商业家，努力为军需民用，进行生产。（五）动员与组织千百万人民，完成与超过一九四八年的经建计划，发展军需民用工业。财政上要实现更进一步的统一集中，并保证军需充足。后方党政军民机关，包括县区武装要以农业生产解决部分或大部自给的任务。（六）整顿党内思想和工作作风。社论勉励东北前后方党政军民，要雄心百倍，勇敢坚定地再接再厉，一致努力，不断的从胜利走向胜利，来完成伟大而光荣的任务。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, 14th: This agency's reporter, Mu Xin, reports on the four-month counter-offensive situation on the Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei battlefields, stating: Since the People's Liberation Army crossed the river on August 23rd of last year, it has advanced a thousand miles south, operating in the vast area south of the Yellow River, north of the Han River, and west of Pinghan (Beijing-Hankou) Railway, achieving four consecutive victories on the western section of the Longhai Railway, the outskirts of Luoyang, the eastern foothills of Funiu Mountain, and the southern section of the Pinghan Railway. On the western front, our army moved south along the ridges of Funiu Mountain and Qinling Mountains, crossed the Dan River, and liberated Shanyang and Zhen'an in southeastern Shaanxi. On the eastern front, our army crossed the Luo River, Yi River, Ru River, Sha River, Bai River, and Tang River, reaching the foothills of Tongbai Mountain, capturing Biyang and Tongbai, with advance troops reaching the Han River bank in northern Hubei. In mid-September, in the first round, our army wiped out six of the eight regiments belonging to the Chiang bandit's Shaanxi Eastern Corps, and the commander-in-chief, Xie Fusan, was dismissed by the Chiang bandits. In early November, the entire 15th Division was completely annihilated, and the division commander, Wu Tinglin, a local tyrant from western Henan with the rank of lieutenant general, was captured alive. In late December, in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, our forces cooperated with the Su-Lu-Yu-Wan (Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui) Army to completely annihilate the Chiang bandit's 5th Army Corps headquarters and the entire 3rd Division. The enemy commander-in-chief, Li Tiejun, fled in a panic.\n\nAt the beginning of our army's crossing of the river, there were nine regular enemy brigades on the Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei battlefields. About seven brigades have been wiped out so far. After Li Tiejun's 5th Army Corps was annihilated on the eastern front, the Chiang bandits still have three divisions and six brigades. On the western front, Pei Changhui's Shaanxi Eastern Corps has been replenished to four divisions and seven brigades. In total, the Chiang bandits have seven divisions and thirteen brigades on the Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei battlefields. Chiang bandit's 30th Division and others, who are invading eastward along the Longhai Railway, are trapped in isolated cities along the line, feeling as if they are sitting on pins and needles. Chiang bandit's 65th Division and others, following the Shaanxi Southern Liberation Army, are wandering on the banks of the Dan River. Chiang bandit's 1st Division, which invaded the Lushi mountainous area for \"encirclement and suppression,\" has also achieved nothing in the past two months.\n\nIn total, by the end of December, in four months, a total of more than 56,000 Chiang bandit regular and local troops were annihilated, thirty-six county towns liberated, a population of more than nine million liberated, and the liberated area stretched six hundred li from east to west and a thousand li from north to south, connecting with the two major liberated areas of Su-Lu-Yu-Wan and E-Yu-Wan (Hubei-Henan-Anhui) in a vast area. The entire territory's strategic locations have been completely controlled by us. Now, we can threaten Xiangfan to the south, control Tongguan and Luoyang to the north, cooperate with the two major armies of E-Yu-Wan and Su-Lu-Yu-Wan to the east, and form a mutually supporting relationship with the Northwest Liberation Army, creating favorable conditions for flexible maneuverability and large-scale annihilation of the enemy in the future.\n\nCurrently, the Liberation Army has firmly established itself in the Funiu Mountain area and is entering a stage of consolidation. Various difficulties in the newly liberated areas are gradually being overcome. Eight sub-districts and administrative offices, more than forty democratic county governments, and the highest political power organ, the Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei Administrative Office, have been established in the entire area. In the past four months, democratic government workers and PLA commanders and fighters have vigorously carried out activities such as opening granaries to help the poor and distributing grain and land, igniting the flames of the people's liberation everywhere. In a sub-district along the Luo River, land distribution has now progressed to the stage of \"leveling and supplementing,\" thus arousing the people's heartfelt support for the democratic government and the Liberation Army. In the battle in the eastern foothills of Funiu Mountain and the large-scale sabotage war in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, the peasants who had initially turned over in areas such as Fangcheng, Lushan, Yancheng, and Xiping, automatically participated in the war to transport the wounded. Wherever the army went, peasants voluntarily joined the army with guns. A large number of young students and people in the education field also participated in the Liberation Army and the work in the liberated areas. People's guerrillas are flourishing. In early October, peasants in four counties of a sub-district seized 927 rifles from landlords. In another sub-district, more than 800 peasants joined local armed forces and militias to protect the fruits of their liberation, and cooperate with field corps to suppress bandits and local bullies, causing most of the bandits to disappear.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 伏牛山已成巩固解放区　记者报导陈谢大军反攻形势\n穆欣\n1948-01-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　伏牛山已成巩固解放区\n  　记者报导陈谢大军反攻形势\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十四日电】本社记者穆欣报导豫陕鄂战场四个月反攻形势称：去年八月二十三日，解放军渡河以来，南进千里，驰骋于黄河以南，汉水以北，平汉以西广大地区，先后在陇海西线、洛阳外围、伏牛东麓、平汉南段四战四捷。西线我军沿着伏牛山和秦岭的脊峰南下，横渡丹江，解放陕东南的山阳、镇安。东线我军越过洛河、伊江、汝河、沙河、白河、唐河，到达桐柏山麓，攻克泌阳、桐柏，先头部队抵达鄂北汉水沿岸。九月中旬，我军在第一个回合中，就把蒋匪陕东兵团所属八个团歼灭了六个，总指挥谢辅三被蒋贼撤职。十一月初彻底歼灭整十五师，生擒该师中将师长豫西土霸王武廷麟。十二月下旬在平汉南段，又配合苏鲁豫皖大军全部歼灭蒋匪第五兵团团部及整三师，敌总指挥李铁军落荒而逃。\n    我军南渡之初，豫陕鄂战场原有敌正规军九个旅，先后被歼约七个旅，东线李铁军第五兵团被歼后，现东线蒋匪尚有三个师六个旅，西线裴昌会陕东兵团又补充至四个师七个旅，豫陕鄂战场蒋匪合计七个师，十三个旅，沿陇海东犯的蒋匪三十师等，正困守沿线孤城，如坐针毯。尾随陕南解放军的蒋匪六十五师等，则徘徊于丹江岸边；侵入卢氏山区“清剿”的蒋匪第一师，两月来亦无所获。\n    总计至十二月底，四个月中，共歼灭蒋匪正规军及地方军五万六千余名。解放县城三十六座，解放人口九百余万，解放区东西长六百余里，南北阔千里，与苏鲁豫皖、鄂豫皖两大解放区在广大地区连成一片。全境军略要地已为我完全控制，现我南可威胁襄樊，北可控制潼洛，东与鄂豫皖及苏鲁豫皖两支大军协同作战，并与西北解放军互为猗角，形成今后灵活机动大量歼敌的有利条件。\n    现解放军已在伏牛山区立稳脚跟，并进入巩固阶段。新解放区各种困难逐渐克服，全区建立了八个分区和专员公署，四十多个民主县政府及最高政权机构豫陕鄂行政公署。四个月来，民主政府工作人员，及解放军指战员，大力进行开仓济贫、分粮分地，到处点燃群众翻身的烈火。洛河沿岸某分区，分配土地现已进至“填平补齐”阶段，因而激起了人民对于民主政府及解放军的衷心拥戴。在伏牛山东麓战役，及此次平汉南段大破击战中，方城、鲁山、郾城、西平等地区初步翻身的农民，自动参战转运伤员，大军所至，农民纷纷自动带枪参军，大批青年学生及教育界人士，亦参加解放军及解放区工作。人民游击队蓬勃发展，某分区四个县的农民，十月初旬，即自地主手中夺取步枪九百二十七支，另一分区有八百余农民参加地方武装及民兵，保卫翻身果实，配合野战兵团剿捕散匪土顽，使大部地区土匪为之匿迹。"

Thus, including the previously reported captured enemy 43rd Division Commander Miao Guangtian, Division Chief of Staff Yi Xiyin, 195th Division Commander Xie Daizheng, Division Chief of Staff Chen Shijie, all the Chiang bandit New 5th Army divisional and regimental commanders have been captured.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 14th: The enemy 195th Division and 43rd Division, annihilated in the Gongzhutun battle, were both Chiang Kai-shek's central direct lineage troops equipped with American weapons. They are currently under the direct jurisdiction or command of the New 5th Army. This army is one of the three armies (namely the New 3rd Army, the New 5th Army, and the New 7th Army) that were pieced together from bandit troops and security forces around the time of our army's autumn offensive. It was formed on the basis of the original 52nd Army's 195th Division, incorporating the Provisional 54th Division (formerly the Northeast Security 7th District troops). Chen Linda, the original commander of the 195th Division, was promoted to commander of the army, and Xie Daizheng, the deputy commander of the division, was reassigned as commander. The 43rd Division originally belonged to the 94th Army. After our autumn offensive began, it was transferred to aid Guanwai. At the end of that battle, as our army in the Jin-Cha-Ji area captured Shijiazhuang, the division was originally scheduled to follow the bandit Provisional 3rd Army to aid Guannei (note: the Provisional 3rd Army was also transferred to aid Guanwai at the same time as this division). Later, because our winter offensive was launched and the return route was cut off, it was assigned to the command of the New 5th Army. Both of the above divisions had suffered serious blows from the People's Liberation Army. The 195th Division was annihilated in the east of Tonghua in February last year, with two regiments wiped out, Deputy Division Commander He Shixiong killed in action, and Division Commander Chen Linda narrowly escaped. The 43rd Division had been almost halved by the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army the year before last.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-16",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Comrades:\n\n　　It is not easy to convene such a large-scale regional troop training and education conference. At this conference, the military regions and columns reported and conducted self-criticisms, exchanged past experiences, and provided opinions on future work. Finally, Deputy Commander Teng gave a concluding report, and the problems that needed to be resolved were resolved. I would like to simply offer a few points for your reference.\n\n　　The spirit of this conference is to review the implementation of the Military Commission's instructions on troop training and cadre training issued on December 24th of last year. The review showed that some units did not convey the instructions, some did not study them, and some comrades had not even seen them. This proves that some comrades' study and implementation of the Military Commission's instructions is very insufficient. While there are some objective reasons for this, and we cannot completely blame the comrades, some responsibility should be borne by the comrades themselves. You should strictly examine why we have not effectively implemented the Military Commission's instructions. Reviewing the past is mainly for the future. After everyone participates in this conference, participates in the review, and listens to Deputy Commander Teng's detailed summary report on troop training and education, you should go back and thoroughly convey this to the troops, encourage them to study meticulously, and implement conscientiously. You must earnestly take on this responsibility. Why? Because troop training and education is a very serious issue and an issue that urgently needs improvement. If the troops' soldiers and cadres are well-trained, battles can be fought well, casualties can be reduced, and victories can be achieved. If the troops are not well-trained, battles will not be fought well, the troops will suffer increased casualties, and the war will fail. Now, the troops of our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region need to intensify training even more. Our experience in large-scale mobile warfare and attacking enemy strongholds is not yet very rich; however, our task is to eliminate the enemy's remaining isolated strongholds and the surrounding remnants in our area. This task is great and arduous. To accomplish this great and arduous task, we need to greatly improve the combat effectiveness of our troops, first of all, to improve the ability to attack fortifications and conduct continuous operations. If the troops are not well-trained, combat effectiveness will not improve; on the contrary, many unnecessary sacrifices will be made. Therefore, we must adopt an extremely responsible attitude towards the people, the revolution, the Party, the soldiers, and the cadres in our troop training and education, and we must seriously treat this issue. According to the spirit of this conference, two different styles exist in our troops: one is a responsible attitude towards the war, the soldiers, and the cadres. They care about the war, care about troop training, care about the soldiers, and cherish the soldiers. This is the correct attitude and the correct style. The other is an irresponsible attitude towards the war and the soldiers. They do not care about the war, do not care about troop training, do not care about the cadres, and do not care about the soldiers. They only blindly hope for and demand victories. But how can we achieve victory? They do not bother to study it carefully. The latter style is very bad and must be overcome. We must vigorously promote the former correct style of caring about the war, caring about training, and caring about the soldiers. Therefore, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and have leaders take responsibility and do it themselves. In the past, some cadres' thinking on the issue of troop training and education was not clear, and they did not take responsibility. That was wrong. Now that the problem has been clarified, leaders at all levels must personally take responsibility. Do not be irresponsible, do not be inactive, or be falsely responsible or falsely active. Every cadre who wants to become a wise and courageous commander cannot only manage fighting battles without managing training and education. Just managing fighting battles, even if you fight well, is only fulfilling part of your duty; moreover, commanders who only manage fighting battles without managing training often do not fight well. It should be known that fighting battles well is based on training the troops well. To be a leader, one must be able to fight battles and train troops. Otherwise, one is not a good commander.\n\n　　Many of our cadres believe that troop training and education is a temporary task. After the meeting, or during the large-scale training movement, they start doing it vigorously, and then slowly relax. Troop training and education is a regular and long-term task. As long as classes exist, as long as war exists, the army must exist. If the army wants to win battles, if it wants the revolutionary war to be victorious and eliminate the enemy, the army's education and training cannot be relaxed for a moment. Relaxing even a little will not benefit the troops or the revolution. Moreover, we are in the midst of a cruel war to overthrow American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek, so we cannot relax troop training and education even slightly.\n\n　　We must oppose the view of cadres who are unwilling to do training and staff work. Many cadres are unwilling to do education work and staff work. This is one of the worst traditions in our troops. They think that if they do training and education work, they cannot become leaders. They think that being a teacher or a staff officer has no status and is the organization's contempt or punishment for them. This is a very bad idea, and it still exists in the troops today. In fact, being a teacher or a staff officer is not easy. Marshal Zhukov of the Soviet Red Army, who made the most outstanding contributions in the Soviet-German War, also worked as a teacher at the Red Army Academy. There is not much of a boundary between the commanders and chiefs of staff of the Soviet Red Army. Today, a commander may become a chief of staff tomorrow; a chief of staff may also be transferred to become a commander. In the past, we emphasized the cultural level of staff officers and teachers, which was certainly justified, but it also led to a deviation. How can this problem be solved when the cultural level of worker-peasant cadres has not yet been raised? I think worker-peasant cadres and intellectual cadres should be combined to run schools and do headquarters work. As long as worker-peasant cadres have rich practical experience and can speak and teach, they can become teachers. When worker-peasant cadres and intellectual cadres work together, worker-peasant cadres can improve their cultural level, and intellectuals can also combine with practice. This can help each other learn from each other and teach each other, and both sides can benefit.\n\n　　In addition, we must oppose the tendency to oppose military work and political work. Some military cadres think that military work is my job, and political work is not my job. Some political cadres think that political work is my job, and military work is not my job. They have forgotten the unity of military work and political work and only emphasize one aspect of it. In fact, military work and political work are one job, and the goals of the two are consistent, which is to win battles. Military work commands combat, which is obviously to defeat the enemy. In order to improve the troops' combat effectiveness and class consciousness, disintegrate the enemy, and unite internally, it is necessary to carry out political work, the purpose of which is still to defeat the enemy. Only seeing military work and not seeing political work is a purely military work viewpoint; only seeing political work and not seeing military work is a purely political work viewpoint. This cannot improve the troops' combat effectiveness; on the contrary, it will weaken the troops' combat effectiveness. Generally speaking, the military is subordinate to politics. But in the army, political work serves the army and uses political work to ensure military victory, while military work and political work are still two sides of the same job. If you argue about whether military work is the main thing or political work is the main thing; or if you argue in schools about whether military time should be more or political time should be more, it is wrong. We must oppose both the purely military work viewpoint and the purely political work viewpoint. Political work is not only a matter for political cadres, military cadres must also do political work; military work is not only a matter for military cadres, political cadres must also do military work. Regardless of whether it is a military work cadre or a political work cadre, there is only a major and minor distinction between military work and political work, and there is no absolute opposing boundary.\n\n　　Oppose empty slogans: The responsibility of leaders and leading organs is not only to issue instructions and raise calls, but also to actually lead, organize, and help the education and training of troops and schools. After the education and training plans and regulations are prescribed and issued, it is necessary to constantly supervise and inspect the implementation situation. Without supervision and inspection, all plans will inevitably form a self-flow phenomenon, often making the original plans unable to be fully realized or simply falling apart. During the inspection, it is necessary to pay attention to whether those plans are appropriate, whether they need to be revised, and issue supplementary instructions in a timely manner, exchange practical experience between various troops, solve all the difficult problems that occur, promote advantages, correct shortcomings, and enable the education and training plans to be fully realized as scheduled. We must oppose the bureaucratic style of only shouting slogans and not doing practical work, and we must oppose treating education and training work as only the work of comrades in schools and training departments, and thinking that we can ignore it. Leaders at all levels must indeed bear the burden of education and training work, not only call for action but also (12) actually participate in and guide the work, not only formulate plans but also organize regular inspections, etc. Only in this way can education and training work be done well. In the education of troops and schools, we must oppose both dogmatism and empiricism. Dogmatism and empiricism will both separate theory from practice. But we cannot oppose theory because we oppose dogmatism. Correct theory is the crystallization of practical experience and the South Needle that directs practical action. Lenin said: \"Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary action.\" It can also be said that without revolutionary military theory, there can be no victory in revolutionary war. Therefore, learning theory is a very important issue. Chairman Mao taught us that learning theory is related to the success or failure of the revolution. Today, our military cadres, especially middle and senior cadres, must use their greatest efforts to study theory. Some cadres neglect the study of theory, thinking that as long as they can fight, they do not need to study theory. This tendency is very wrong. Learning and understanding Chairman Mao's revolutionary theory (including revolutionary military theory) is like using a telescope to observe the enemy's situation when we command operations. Without the help of a telescope, you cannot see the situation in the distance and become blind. It is like analyzing things that are invisible to the eye with a microscope in a laboratory. Without the help of a microscope, you cannot obtain knowledge of things that you cannot see with your eyes. Therefore, revolutionary theory is our telescope and microscope for doing things, and it is also our scientific method for doing work. Practical experience is very valuable, but when it cannot rise to become theory, experience can sometimes cause major problems. Only relying on courage to fight without studying theory will become narrow military empiricism. Dogmatism separates theory from practice, and empiricism ignores theory, both are wrong. We must study Chairman Mao's way of thinking and Chairman Mao's military theory well. Everyone can take a good look at the book \"Day and Night\". In \"Day and Night\", there are two typical military cadres of the Soviet Red Army: one is Battalion Commander Shaburov, who is a typical soldier with both wisdom and courage. One is Regiment Commander Baberchenko, who is a typical narrow empiricist with courage but no strategy. Shaburov became a hero who defeated the enemy, while Baberchenko made a needless sacrifice. Such practical experience and lessons in our army are even more numerous. From this, we should get a good lesson.\n\n　　Leaders should set an example in learning theory. Deputy Commander Teng stipulated some theoretical books that cadres should study in his summary report. Be sure to study all the books that are stipulated to be studied. Cadres should read books and learn principles. Not only is it a matter of reading, but also to combine it with practice, learn and use consistently, and learn to apply. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu often taught us to study theory well, to be good at summarizing experience, to elevate experience to theory, and to enrich theory to guide practice. \"Learn what you do, use what you learn.\" Learn and then use, use and then learn, use repeatedly, learn repeatedly, and improve step by step in continuous learning and use. If some cadres are unwilling to study theory, they should be enlightened to study and helped to study. If they do not voluntarily study, they should be forced to study and stipulated that they must read the books they are required to read. If worker-peasant cadres cannot read books themselves, intellectuals should read them to him and explain them to him. After reading and explaining them to him, ask him if he understands. This year, cadres will be inspected for their theoretical studies at a certain period. The large military region will be inspected, and each military region will also be inspected. But the main thing in learning theory is to rely on self-consciousness. If you are self-conscious, you will have time and you will be able to study. It is necessary to create a style of learning. Whoever does not learn will not progress, will lag behind or be eliminated. Some cadres carry their burdens and refuse to let go, put on airs of being veterans, put on airs of being meritorious ministers, abandon themselves, and refuse to learn. The Party's cadre policy takes morality, talent, and seniority as the standards; seniority is placed in the third place. And this seniority does not simply refer to qualifications, but refers to reputation. Therefore, it is not enough to rely on an old qualification alone. The result of putting on airs of being a veteran is the result of Gorlov. It should be known that not learning is shameful, not learning will lag behind. Gorlov put on airs of being a veteran and did not learn, and was finally eliminated. We must oppose the Gorlov thought. Putting on airs of being a veteran and not learning is Gorlov. A large cadre putting on airs of being a veteran is a big Gorlov, and a small cadre putting on airs of being a veteran is a small Gorlov. Whoever does not want to be Gorlov should study hard.\n\n　　Mass line issue: As far as the army is concerned, from the commander-in-chief to the squad leader, whether it is the headquarters, the political department, the logistics department, or any other organ, the most basic issue is the idea of serving the soldiers. The most basic and broadest masses in the troops are the soldiers. It is also the soldiers who directly fight the enemy in battle. Without the soldiers, nothing can be accomplished, and the army itself cannot exist. Therefore, the mass line in the army can be said to be the line of serving the soldiers, and serving the masses is serving the soldiers. But some cadres do not care about the soldiers, his eyes only look up and do not look down. He cannot make the troops unite into an iron fist. This is an extremely bad tendency. We must clearly establish the idea of serving the soldiers, constantly care about their lives, care about their education and training, care about solving their difficult problems, and cherish their lives as much as we cherish our own lives.\n\n　　The political education of the troops is basically spiritual education. The main thing is to improve the fighting spirit, to cultivate a tenacious fighting style, to develop a style of hating the enemy and being harmonious with ourselves, and to have the heroic spirit of \"not being afraid of you\" no matter what enemy is faced, and to have supreme courage. Refraining from arrogance is for the commanders. The French Napoleon has a famous saying: \"The last five minutes.\" We must keep this in mind. The last five minutes are the key to determining victory or defeat. Many commanders are most prone to wavering in their determination at the most difficult and serious times, such as when casualties are high, repeatedly attacking and retreating, and the troops are prone to fatigue from continuous operations and continuous marching. It is easiest to let go of the final decisive moment. Therefore, it is necessary to keep in mind one thing: When you are at your most serious and most difficult, it is also the enemy's most serious and most difficult time. Often when your determination wavers due to difficulties, it is precisely when the enemy has felt despair about victory. This opportunity is the most important moment. This opportunity depends on which side can persevere, which side can survive the last five minutes, and which side can achieve victory. Therefore, we must insist on the last five minutes. The battles of Dayang Lake and Yangshanji were both battles in which leaders Liu and Deng were able to persevere for the last five minutes and achieve the final victory of annihilating the enemy. To cultivate oneself into a good commander, one must pay attention to: First, be brave and decisive, but not be impatient and rude. Bravery and decisiveness include wisdom. Second, be cautious and meticulous, but not be hesitant and indecisive, that is, as instructed by the central government, fight battles with planning, preparation, and certainty of victory. We must all pay more attention to these areas.\n\n　　New recruit education is also very important. A commander must understand that people are the most precious. It is not easy for a child to grow into an adult. It takes eighteen to twenty years to grow into a person and reach the age of serving in the army. People cannot be resurrected after death. Therefore, we must cherish soldiers and cherish soldiers. It is a death-seeking tactic to pull a new recruit to the front line without training. It is also a death-seeking tactic to let soldiers rush around without talking about tactics. It is a crime for a commander to casually ask subordinates and soldiers to die. It is necessary to sacrifice people in battles, but there cannot be unnecessary sacrifices. If you understand this, you will naturally strengthen the training and education of the troops.\n\n　　Finally, let's talk about the system issue: It is good and necessary to establish various systems in the troops. Without a certain system, it cannot be called an army. After the system is established, the main thing is to consolidate the system. It is wrong to forget it after the meeting. After the system is announced, everyone must abide by it and resolutely implement it. If you find a place that needs to be revised, you can propose a revision. But before it is revised, you cannot refuse to implement it on the pretext. In addition, for education and training, combat command, and administrative management, no matter who or which organ treats anyone or any organ, opinions can be raised. For example, systems such as assessing casualties and reviewing combat experience should promote democracy and promote the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. When soldiers make suggestions to cadres and subordinates make suggestions to superiors, such as criticizing cadres and superiors for improper command, increasing casualties, and other shortcomings and errors in command, tactics, and technology, they should humbly adopt and correct the shortcomings and errors, as well as other criticisms and self-criticisms of all work. This is a high degree of democracy in the army. But there is also the highest concentration. Subordinates must resolutely obey the orders and instructions of superiors. If you have opinions on orders and instructions, you can also raise them; but when the superior has not revised the order, you must still resolutely implement it. Destroying the system and disobeying orders is destroying discipline. Destroying discipline will be punished by discipline. We must strengthen the discipline of the army and cultivate a style of consciously abiding by discipline. Only when a high degree of democracy and a high degree of concentration are embodied can our army be an iron army, can it be united, can it overcome the enemy and win, can it defeat the U.S. and Chiang, achieve final victory, and be worthy of being an army led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 军区训练教育会议上　徐向前副司令员讲话\n\n1948-01-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　军区训练教育会议上\n  　徐向前副司令员讲话\n    一九四七年十二月二十六日同志们：\n    象这样大的全区的部队训练教育会议，召集起来很不容易。在这次会议上，各军区各纵队进行了汇报和检讨，并交换了过去的经验，提供了以后工作上的意见，最后滕副司令员又作了总结报告，需要解决的问题都解决了。我简单地提出几点意见，供同志们参考。\n    这次会议的精神，是检查去年十二月二十四日军委关于练兵及训练干部的指示的执行情形。检查的结果，有的没有传达，有的没有研究，有的同志还根本没有看到。这证明有些同志对军委指示的研究和执行是非常不够的。这固然有些客观原因，不能完全怪同志们，但有些责任是应该同志们负的，你们应严格的检讨一番，为什么军委的指示我们没有很好的执行？检讨过去，主要的为了将来。大家参加了这次会议，参加了检讨，又听取了滕副司令员关于部队训练教育的详细总结报告，回去以后，应好好传达和号召部队细致的研究和切实的执行。要切实的把这一责任负担起来。为什么呢？因为部队的训练教育，是十分严重的问题，是急迫需要改进的问题。部队的士兵和干部训练好了，仗就可以打好，可以减少伤亡，就可以取得胜利。部队训练不好，仗就打不好，就会增加部队的伤亡，战争就会失败。现在我们晋冀鲁豫军区的部队，更需加紧训练。我们对大规模的运动战和攻击敌人坚固据点的经验还不很丰富；可是我们的任务，是要肃清我区敌人残留的孤立据点和周围的残余敌人。这个任务是伟大的，也是艰巨的。要完成这伟大而又艰巨的任务，需要我们部队的战斗力大大提高一步，首先是提高攻坚和连续作战的能力。如果部队训练不好，战斗力就不会提高；相反的会遭到好多无谓的牺牲。因此我们对部队的训练教育，要采取对人民、对革命、对党、对战士和干部以极其负责的态度，要严肃的对待这一问题。根据这次大会的精神，检查我们的部队，存在着两种不同的作风：一种是对战争对战士对干部负责的态度，他关心战争，关心部队训练，关心士兵，爱护士兵，这是正确的态度正确的作风；另一种是对战争对士兵不负责的态度，他不关心战争，不关心部队的训练，不关心干部，不关心士兵，只是盲目的希望和要求打胜仗。可是如何才能打胜仗呢？他却不去好好研究了。后面这种作风是非常坏的，定要把它克服掉。前面那种关心战争，关心训练，关心士兵的正确作风，我们要好好发扬起来。因此，我们必须遵照毛主席的指示，要首长负责，亲自动手。过去各级首长对部队训练教育问题的思想有些干部还没有搞通，没有负起责来，那是不对的。今天把问题搞清楚了，各级首长就要亲自负起责来，不要不负责不动手，或者假负责假动手。首先我们要反对首长不负责或假负责的坏作风。每个干部要想成为一个智勇双全的指挥员，只管打仗不管训练教育是不行的。只管打仗，就打得好也只是尽了你的职责的一部分；而且，只管打仗不管训练的指挥员是往往打不好仗的。须知打好仗是建筑在练好兵的基础之上的。作一个首长，必须会打仗又会练兵。否则就不是好的指挥员。\n    我们有许多干部，以为部队的训练教育是临时任务。开罢会，或者在大练兵运动中，开始轰轰烈烈的做一下，以后就慢慢松了气了。部队的训练教育是经常的、长期的。阶级存在一天，战争存在一天，军队就必须存在。军队要打胜仗，要想使革命战争取得胜利，把敌人消灭掉，军队的教育训练是一时一刻也不能放松的。稍放松一点，对部队对革命是无好处的。何况我们正处在为打倒美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石的残酷战争中，更不能对部队训练教育稍微放松一点。\n    我们要反对干部不愿作训练工作参谋工作的观点。有好多干部不愿作教育工作和参谋工作，这是我们部队中最不好的一种传统。他们以为做了训练教育工作，就当不了首长。他们以为当教员当参谋没有地位，是组织上对自己的轻视或处罚。这是非常坏的思想，直到今天还在部队中存在着。其实当教员当参谋是很不容易的。苏联红军的朱可夫元帅，在苏德战争中是战功最著的，他过去也在红大当过教员。苏联红军的司令员和参谋长，就没有什么多大界限。今天当司令员到明天也会去当参谋长；当参谋长也可能调换去当司令员。过去我们对于参谋教员，强调文化水平，这固然有其原因，但也发生了偏向，当工农干部的文化水准尚未提高起来，这个问题怎样解决呢？我想应该工农干部和知识分子干部结合起来办学校和作司令部工作。工农干部只要有丰富的实际经验，能说能教，就可以去当教员。工农干部和知识分子干部结合起来工作，一面工农干部可以提高文化水平，一面知识分子也可结合了实际。这样可以互助互学互教，双方都可得益。\n    另外我们要反对把军事工作和政治工作对立起来的倾向。有些军事干部以为军事工作是我的工作，政治工作不是我的工作。有些政治干部却以为政治工作是我的工作，军事工作不是我的工作。他们把军事工作和政治工作的统一性忘掉了，只强调其中的一个方面。实际上军事工作和政治工作是一个工作，二者的目的是一致的，都是为了打胜仗。军事工作指挥战斗，这是显而易见的在于打倒敌人。为了提高部队的战斗力及阶级觉悟，瓦解敌人，团结内部，就必须进行政治工作，目的仍然是为的打倒敌人。只看到军事工作而看不到政治工作，是单纯军事工作观点；只看到政治工作而看不到军事工作，是单纯政治工作观点。这样不能提高部队的战斗力，相反的会削弱部队的战斗力。一般的说，军事服从政治。但在军队里，政治工作是服务于军队的，要用政治工作保障军事的胜利，而军事工作与政治工作仍然是一个工作的两面。如果争执军事为主，还是政治为主；或者学校里争执军事时间要多，还是政治时间要多，这都是不对的。单纯的军事工作观点和单纯的政治工作观点，我们都要反对掉。而政治工作也不是专门政治干部的事，军事干部也必须作政治工作；军事工作也并不是专门军事干部的事，而政治干部也必须作军事工作。不论是军事工作干部，不论是政治工作干部，对军事工作和政治工作两者间相互关联，只有主要与次要之分，而无绝对对立的界限。\n    反对空喊：首长和领导机关的责任，不只是发指示和提号召，而是要实际的去领导、组织和帮助部队和学校的教育与训练，把教育和训练计划规定和发下去以后，就必须经常督促和检查执行的情形如何，没有督促和检查，一切计划必然形成自流的现象，往往使原来的计划不能完满实现或者简直落了空。在检查中必须注意，那些计划是否妥善，是否须要修改，并适时发出补充的指示，交换各部队间实际经验，解决发生的一切困难问题，发扬优点纠正缺点，使教育训练的计划能如期的完满实现。要反对只空喊不实际干的官僚主义，要反对把教育和训练工作当作只是办学校的和训练部门同志们的事，自己是可以不管的。各级首长必须确确实实地把教育和训练的工作负担起来，不只要号召而且要（⑴⑵）实际参加去作和指导，不只要规定计划而且要组织经常的检查等等，只有这样才能把教育和训练工作办好。在部队和学校的教育中，我们都要反对教条主义和经验主义。教条主义和经验主义都会使理论和实际脱节。但是不能因反教条而把理论也反对掉。正确的理论是实际经验的结晶与指示实际行动的南针。列宁说：“没有革命的理论，就没有革命的行动。”也可以说，没有革命的军事理论，就没有革命战争的胜利。因此学习理论是非常重要的问题。毛主席教导我们学理论是有关革命成败的问题。今天我们部队军事干部，尤其是中、上级干部，要用最大的努力学习理论。有些干部忽视理论的学习，认为只要能打仗就行了，不必学习理论，这种倾向是非常错误的。学习与领会毛主席的革命的理论（革命的军事理论也在内），好比我们指挥作战时用望远镜观察敌战情一样，没有望远镜的帮助，远处的情况你就看不到，成了瞎子一样。好比如在化验室内用显微镜分析眼看不见的东西一样，没有显微镜的帮助，就不能获得眼看不到的东西的知识。所以革命的理论，就是我们作事的望远镜和显微镜，也就是我们作工作的科学方法。实际经验是很宝贵的，但当它不能上升成为理论时，经验有时就会害大事，只凭勇敢去打仗，不学习理论，会变成狭隘的军事经验论。教条主义把理论和实际脱节了，经验主义把理论忽视了，都是不对的。我们要很好的学习毛主席的思想方法，学习毛主席的军事理论。大家可以好好看看“日日夜夜”这本书。“日日夜夜”上，有苏联红军两个典型军事干部：一个是营长沙布洛夫，那是智勇双全的典型军人。一个是团长巴柏琴科，那是狭隘经验论者有勇无谋的典型。沙布洛夫成了战胜敌人的英雄，而巴柏琴科却作了无谓的牺牲者。我军这种实际经验教训，更是举不胜举，从这中间我们应得到很好的教训。\n    学理论首长要以身作则。滕副司令员在总结报告中，规定了一些干部应学习的理论书籍。凡规定要学习的书，一定要去学习。干部要看书，学原则。不仅是看的问题，而且要结合在实际中去运用它，学用一致，学以致用。毛主席朱总司令经常教导我们好好学习理论，要善于总结经验，要把经验上升为理论，要把理论丰富起来再去指导实践。“做什么学什么，用什么学什么。”学了再用，用了再学，反复的用，反复的学，在不断的学和用中，就能一步步提高。如果有些干部不愿学习理论的，就要启发他学习，帮助他学习。如果不自愿的去学习，就实行强迫的学，规定要看的书非看不行。工农干部不能自己看书的，知识分子要念给他听，并给他讲解，给他念了讲了，再问他懂不懂。今年干部学习理论，到一定时期要进行检查，大军区要检查，各个军区也要检查。但是学理论，主要的还是要靠自觉性。一有自觉性就会有时间、就会学得进去的。要造成学习的风尚。谁不学习，谁就不能进步，就要落伍或被淘汰。有的干部背了包袱不放，摆老资格，摆功臣，自暴自弃，不肯学习。党的干部政策以德、才、资三者作标准的；资是摆在第三位。而且这个资，不是简单的指资格，是指的资望。因此只靠一个老资格是不行的。摆老资格的结果，就是戈尔洛夫的结果。须知不学习是可耻的，不学习就要落后，戈尔洛夫摆老资格不学习，最后是被淘汰下去了。我们要反对戈尔洛夫思想，摆老资格不学习就是戈尔洛夫，大干部摆老资格是大戈尔洛夫，小干部摆老资格是小戈尔洛夫。谁不愿当戈尔洛夫，谁就应该好好学习。\n    群众路线问题：按军队来说，上自统帅，下至班排长，不管是司令部政治部和后勤部及其他一切机关，最基本的问题就是为兵服务的思想。部队中最基本最广大的群众就是士兵，在战斗中直接去打敌人的，也是士兵。离开了士兵，什么事也干不成，而且军队本身也就不能存在了。因此在军队中的群众路线，可以说就是为兵服务的路线，为群众服务就是为兵服务。可是有些干部不关心士兵，他的眼睛只向上看，不往下看，他就不能使部队团结成为一个铁的拳头，这是极坏的倾向。我们要明确树立为兵服务的思想，要经常关心他们的生活，关心对他们的教育和训练，要关心解决他们的困难问题，要爱护他们的生命如同爱护自己的生命一样。\n    部队政治教育，基本上是精神教育，主要的是提高战斗精神，要培养成顽强的战斗作风，要养成对敌恨对己和的作风，不论是面向着任何敌人，都有“不怕你”的英雄气概，要有无上的勇气。戒骄是对指挥员说的。法国拿破仑有句名言：“最后的五分钟”，我们要牢记在心。最后五分钟，是决定胜负的关头。好多指挥员在最艰苦最严重的时候，譬如说伤亡很大，反复的打上去又退下来，部队的连续作战与连续行军很易感觉疲劳等，这种时机最易动摇决心，最易把最后决胜的时机放过去，因此须牢记一条：当你是最严重最困难的时候，也是敌人最严重最困难的时候，常常是当你因困难在决心发生动摇的时候，而恰恰正是敌人对胜利已感到绝望的时候，这种时机是最紧要的关头，这种时机决定于何方能坚持，何方能熬过这最后的五分钟，何方就能取得胜利，因此我们要坚持最后五分钟。选择指挥员，最好的是能顽强不屈，坚持最后五分钟。大杨湖战斗和羊山集战斗，都是刘邓首长能坚持最后五分钟，取得了最后歼灭敌人的胜利。要修养成为一个好指挥员须注意：一是勇猛果敢，但不要急燥粗暴，勇猛果敢是包括智慧的。二是谨慎细致，但不要犹豫不决，即如中央所指示的要打有计划的有准备的有胜利把握的仗。我们大家须要在这些地方多加注意。\n    新兵教育也是十分重要的。一个指挥员必须懂得，人是最宝贵的。从一个小孩子长大成人，是很不容易的。长成一个人长成到当兵的年龄，需要十八到二十年，人死去是不能复活的。因此我们要爱护士兵，爱惜士兵。一个新兵如果不加训练就拉上火线，那是送死战术。不讲战术叫士兵去乱冲，也是送死战术。一个指挥员随便叫下级和士兵去送死，那是罪恶。打仗是必须牺牲人的，但不能作无谓牺牲。懂得了这一条，自然就要加强对部队的训练和教育了。\n    最后谈一谈制度问题：部队中建立了各种制度是好的，必需的。没有一定的制度，就不成其为军队。制度定了以后，主要的是巩固制度。如果开过会后就忘掉了是不对的。制度公布以后，必须大家遵守，坚决实现。如果发现需要修改的地方，可提议修改。但在未修改以前，不能借故不执行。此外对于教育训练、作战指挥、行政管理，不管任何人和机关对待任何人和任何机关，有意见都可提出。譬如评定伤亡检讨作战经验等制度，应提倡民主，发扬批评与自我批评的精神。战士对干部，下级对上级提的意见如批评干部和上级指挥不当、增多伤亡及其他指挥上和战术上技术上各种缺点和错误的意见时，应虚心采纳改正缺点和错误，以及其他一切工作的批评和自我批评等，这是军队中高度的民主。但是还有一个最高的集中。上级的命令和指示，下级必须坚决服从。对命令和指示有意见，也可以提出；但当上级未修改命令时，仍须坚决执行。破坏制度、违抗命令，就是破坏纪律，破坏纪律要纪律制裁。我们要把军队的纪律严肃起来，要养成自觉遵守纪律的作风。只有这样体现了高度的民主与高度的集中时，我们的军队才是铁的军队，才能万众一心，才能克敌致胜，才能打垮美蒋，取得最后的胜利，才不愧为共产党毛主席所领导的一支军队。"

    "content": "[Taiyue News] Wang Shouzhi, a correspondent from Qiutun in the first district of Meng County, who was a \"leading employer of the poor,\" made a self-criticism on December 30th of last year regarding his speculative thinking and \"armchair strategist\" style. He said: When I read the article in the No. 5 newspaper about the leading cadres in the first district of Meng County lacking a class viewpoint and harming the hired and poor peasants in Qiutun, I was very unhappy and my attitude was not calm. Later, after reviewing the situation, I realized that I had the following shortcomings in my writing: (1) My starting point at the time was to rush, for example, when I mentioned \"leading employer of the poor,\" the leaders of the first district did not mention this matter; they mentioned \"leading cadres.\" (2) I did not conduct in-depth investigations. The facts I reported were based solely on reports from a few comrades and village cadres, which I treated as valuable material and wrote into news, resulting in detachment from reality. Some things were only superficially understood, and the writing was incomplete. For example, the three households in Xizhen, including Tang Jiu Suo, handing in public grain, was only mentioned, not produced, but I distorted the facts in my reporting. (3) I lacked a class viewpoint in viewing the problems. For example, Zhang Lanying from Nanzhen handed in ten kilograms of public grain, and the women pushed the mill to grind public grain. This was originally the leadership forcing the poor peasants to hand in public grain. I did not think about how they would live after handing in the public grain and praised them in general terms.

He was a local tyrant in the past and still is now. Wearing the hat of \"chairman of the farmers' association,\" he oppresses hired laborers and does all sorts of evil, casually seizing the wives of poor people. Because of District Chief Guo's landlord background, no one dares to touch a hair on his head. The second type is Section Chief Zhao of the judicial department and District Chief Zhao, who eat the people's public grain and still scold the people. They are handling official business in the government office and don't want to do things for the poor. \"The district government can't fight with the district government, and the village can't have conflicts with the village.\" In his mind, the government is an anti-people sectarian force. In Guo Wenzhang's words, it's called a \"corporate government,\" and this sectarian force doesn't even give the poor hired laborers \"two cents of justice.\" The last type is people who are full and idle all day long, like the county magistrate who can read the newspaper but doesn't bother with the poor people who come to him to file complaints. Even at the special commissioner's office, they can only hear two \"fair\" words that don't really solve the problems for the poor. The upper levels push it down to the lower levels, and the lower levels are the same. The democratic government is controlled by these people, \"officials protecting each other,\" mutually shielding each other, \"all those who talk and laugh are landlords, and there are no poor hired laborers who come and go.\" They only support Wang Wenyi and don't support Guo Wenzhang. Where can the poor speak?\n\n　　We all need to stand firm, sweep away bureaucracy, thoroughly investigate Guo Wenzhang's grievances, expose all the hidden local rich peasants, and continue to expose all events that violate the interests of the poor in various places.

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Autumn Grain Collection Harmed the Interests of Poor Laborers\n　　Meng County's First District Committee Accepts Criticism from Party Newspaper\n　　[Taiyue News] After reading the Taiyue Xinhua Daily's criticism of their district's autumn grain collection work and leadership, the First District Committee of Meng County quickly held a meeting for self-examination, admitting that the autumn grain collection had harmed the interests of poor laborers. They sent their self-criticism to the newspaper. Their review stated: \"After our District Committee saw the newspaper, we immediately notified each key village to conduct a review. We also made a serious self-criticism at the joint meeting of key village group leaders convened by the county, and finally made a self-criticism at the meeting of district and village cadres and poor laborer activists. We have identified the following points: (1) At the cadre and activist meeting on November 3rd last year, when discussing how to complete the autumn grain collection work, some village cadres proposed: 'I will take the lead and temporarily lend grain, and later make adjustments to compensate for surpluses or deficits.' When we summarized these methods at the time, we said: 'The method of cadres taking the lead in temporary lending can be used.' This method was proposed by village cadres of middle peasant background, and we did not consider the difficulties of poor laborer cadres and activists, thus making it difficult for them (poor laborers). Because although this is a temporary loan, they (poor laborers) themselves do not have enough to eat, so how can they afford to lend it? (2) At the autumn grain collection summary meeting, Beikaiyi Village was commended as a model for autumn grain collection, and a banner was also presented as a reward. At that time, three criteria were proposed for the award: speed, fair and reasonable methods, and the ability to overcome difficulties. According to these three standards, Beikaiyi Village completed the autumn grain collection work in two days, the fastest completion in the entire district. The methods were also fair, and peanuts could be used to exchange for millet, solving the difficulties of households without millet. Upon review today, the village head of this village is a bad element. Although we had suspicions about him in the past, we did not find any concrete evidence. It was only during the poor laborer symposium after the autumn grain collection that it was discovered that they had many problems in their autumn grain collection, such as rich people being able to arbitrarily set quotas, while poor people could not. However, many villages were led by poor peasants who supervised other classes to complete the public grain task, but they were not rewarded simply because they completed the task later. For example, in villages such as Donghan Village, Tang Village, Taizi, and Wutong, poor peasants bore no burden at all, and many villages assigned quotas after discussions and evaluations by the Turn-Over Association, Single-Minded Association, United-Heart Association, and Peasants' Association. We did not reward or report on these villages led by poor peasants; on the contrary, we rewarded villages led by bad people that had many problems. We recognized the facts of poor peasants contributing labor, grain, and money—facts which harmed the interests of poor laborers—as correct, and even wrote praise articles. What else can this illustrate besides our blurred class viewpoint? (3) When deploying the work, the leadership's intention was to quickly complete the public grain quotas, and then conduct detailed evaluations to achieve fairness and reasonableness, so as to avoid the poor peasants suffering losses. Because of the short period of time to assign quotas and grain numbers, unfairness was inevitable. As a result, the leadership focused very tightly on collecting things during the requisition period, but very loosely during the detailed evaluation period, and the inspection was also very poor. This illustrates our purely task-oriented view and our insufficient responsibility towards the poor laborer class. (4) In the Shangduqu extremely poor class, there were about twenty households who bore over 500 catties of grain, which, although not a large amount, these extremely poor people had a very thin base and only harvested one autumn crop this year, so they should not have borne any burden at all. At that time, the leadership did not decline their enthusiasm and good intentions, which shows that our consideration for the difficulties of poor laborers was very insufficient. (5) When we saw the Party newspaper's criticism, we had some wrong ideas about weighing personal gains and losses, but later we realized that this was not a true poor laborer viewpoint, because what we were concerned about and valued was not the interests of the poor laborer class, but personal gains and losses. Therefore, the expression of a true poor laborer viewpoint should be a strict spirit of self-criticism and a serious spirit of responsibility towards the poor laborer class. After recognizing this point, the leading cadres in our district conducted a serious review of the autumn grain collection work, believing that the basic root cause of the unclear class viewpoint lies in the fact that the vast majority of our leading cadres are not of poor laborer background. We cannot appreciate the difficulties of the poor laborer class in every work and action, and constantly take care of their interests. The Party newspaper's severe criticism greatly alerted us and requires every cadre to stand firm in their position in future work. However, due to limitations in understanding, we cannot say that this review is very profound.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 秋屯中损害贫雇利益　孟县一区分委会接受党报批评\n\n1948-01-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　秋屯中损害贫雇利益\n  　孟县一区分委会接受党报批评\n    【太岳消息】孟县一区分委会看了太岳新华日报对他区秋屯工作和领导上的批评，很快的开会检查，承认秋屯中损害了雇贫。并做了自我批评寄到报社。他们检讨说：“我们分委会看到报纸后，马上就通知各基点进行检查。又在县里召集的基点小组长联席会上作了郑重的检查，最后还在区、村干部、雇贫积极分子会议上作了自我批评。检讨出以下几点：（一）在去年十一月三日的干部积极分子会议上，讨论怎么完成秋屯工作时，有些村干部提出：“我起带头，暂借出粮食来，以后长退短补。”当时我们归纳这些办法时说：“干部带头暂借的办法可以用。”这个办法是由中农成份的村干部提出，我们没有考虑到雇贫农干部、积极分子的困难，因而为难了他们（雇贫）。因为这虽是暂借，但他们（雇贫）自己还不够吃，哪里能借的起呢？（二）在秋屯总结会议上，表扬了北开仪村为秋屯模范，还赠送给一面奖旗。当时提出奖励标准有三：迅速、办法公平合理、能克服困难。根据这三个标准，北开仪村两天完成秋屯工作，在全区说来完成的最快。办法也公平，还能用花生去换小米，解决无米户的困难。今天检查起来，这个村的村长是个坏分子，过去我们虽然对他怀疑，但没有找到确实的证据。在秋屯后的雇贫座谈会上，才检查出来他们秋屯的毛病很多，如富人可以随便下分数，穷人则不行。但有许多是贫农领导，监督其他阶层完成公粮任务的，仅因完成任务较迟，而没有得到奖励。如东韩村、唐村、太子、梧桐等村贫农根本没出负担，许多村都是经过翻身会、一心会、合心会、农会讨论评议后派的。这些贫农掌握领导的村子，我们不给奖励，不给报导，相反的奖励了坏人领导、毛病百出的村子。把贫农出力、出粮、出钱等损害雇贫利益的事实，反认成对的，还写了表扬稿子。这除了说明我们的阶级观点模糊外，还能说明什么呢？（三）在布置工作时，领导上的意图是很快完成公粮数字，以后再详细评议，求得公平合理，免得贫农吃亏。因短短数天内派出分数和粮数，难免有不公的地方。结果在要东西期间，领导上抓得很紧，而在详细评议期间，则抓得很松，检查也很差。这说明了我们的单纯任务观点和对雇贫阶级不够负责。（四）上段渠赤贫阶层有二十来户，身担了五百余斤，数目虽说不大，但这些赤贫底子太薄，今年才收了一季秋，应当是不负担才对。当时领导上对于他们的热情与好意没有谢绝，这说明我们对雇贫困难的体贴是很不够的。（五）当我们看到党报的批评时，曾有一些计较个人得失的错误想法，但后来发觉这不是真正的雇贫观点，因为我们计较与重视的不是雇贫阶级利益，而是个人的得失。因此真正雇贫观点的表现，应当是严格的自我批评精神，严肃的对雇贫阶级负责的精神。认识了这一点以后，我区领导干部才对秋屯工作作了认真的检查，认为阶级观点不明确的基本根源，在于我们领导干部的成份和出身绝大多数不是雇贫成份。我们不能在每一件工作和言行中体会雇贫阶层的困难，时刻照顾他们的利益。党报对我们这个严厉的批评，大大警惕了我们，并要求每个干部今后在工作中要站稳脚跟。但由于认识上的限制，我们不能说这个检讨已很深刻。"

    "content": "Xijing Rich Peasant Cadre Abducts Hired Laborer's Wife\n　　Wu'an Government Shields Thug\n 　  Lawsuit Reaches Border Region Government, Unresolved After Two Years\n　　[Report from this newspaper] Guo Wenzhang, a hired poor disaster victim from Xijing Village, Wu'an, had his wife seized by the agricultural association director, who was from a rich peasant family. His lawsuit, filed from the district to the special commissioner's office, has been stonewalled for two years, with governments at all levels failing to resolve it from a class standpoint. This time, he came to the Border Region Government to file a complaint and personally requested this newspaper to publish his statement on his behalf. The situation is as follows:\n　　Guo Wenzhang is a hired poor disaster victim from Xijing Village, Wu'an. For nine years, he and his father and son suffered for the rich peasant Wang Wenyi (whether Wang Wenyi is from a rich peasant or landlord background deserves re-examination), renting mountain land and even repairing one mu of land for him. Every year, they paid a rent of one dan and eight dou. After the age of twenty, he went to Shanxi to farm mountain land, but his family couldn't adapt to the environment, and his wife and brothers and sisters-in-law all died of illness. In the 30th year of the Republic [1941], he fled famine to Shangyao, Licheng, to open a restaurant. His father stayed in his hometown and starved to death after selling the house and land (two mu). In the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], he sought out a refugee woman, Wang Cunlan, as his partner, and his cousin introduced them, sending her to Black Tiger Temple in Licheng to get married. Soon after, they went together to Anze to farm mountain land. In May of the 35th year of the Republic [1946], Guo Wenzhang sent his wife back to Wu'an from Anze, carrying 30,000 yuan to settle in Xijing. When the woman returned, the agricultural association director, Wang Wenyi, saw her and considered her a good \"match,\" detaining her at the home of the landlord Wang Shijie. Guo Wenzhang's uncle was so anxious that he searched everywhere. Guo said: \"When my woman showed her face, the agricultural association director had already agreed on the marriage with District Chief Guo Chaodong and married Wang Wenyi.\"\n　　He continued to explain the origin of the matter: \"On the 22nd day of the fifth lunar month, I returned from fleeing famine in Anze and met Hu Shuiheng, a farmer from my village, at Dongguan, Licheng, who said that my wife had been seized by a cadre and married off. I went home and found the village chief, asking who authorized the allocation of my wife to the agricultural association director. The village chief said, 'District Chief Guo made the decision, and our village cadres can't control it.' At that time, I went to the Sixth District Office of Huoshui to file a complaint with District Chief Zhao. The government called the woman to the district office and detained her for six days. Without paying attention to us, they sent her back. I heard people say that the village cadres went to the Seventh District to seek connections, and District Chief Guo of the Seventh District encouraged the agricultural association director, saying, 'I guarantee that this woman won't be lost; if she is lost, I'll compensate you with three.' District Chief Guo sent a letter and released the woman. I went to District Chief Zhao again, and he said, 'This was handled by District Chief Guo, and I can't control it.' He told me to go to the Seventh District Office to resolve it. I knew that District Chief Guo was of one mind with the village cadres and didn't want to go to the Seventh District. District Chief Zhao also said, 'I can't control it; it's up to you whether you go!' I had no choice but to accuse District Chief Zhao, saying, 'If you are willing to handle it, handle it for us; if you are not willing, please approve it for the county to handle!' I went to the county government. The first time, I found a female comrade who told me to go back to the district to resolve it. The second time, I found the Civil Affairs Section; two section chiefs. One asked, 'Who is being unreasonable in handling this matter?' The other said, 'It is not right for Guo Chaodong, this boor (?), to handle this matter!' I said, 'Isn't it inappropriate to handle it like this? They just handled it like this, or else I wouldn't be filing a lawsuit!' The female comrade said something conscientious: 'The village cadres are handling it unreasonably; they should call the woman to resolve it face-to-face.' Later, the Judicial Section asked twice, and the section chief's mind changed, saying, 'The district office cannot quarrel with the district office, and the village cannot have conflicts with the village.' They \"officials protect each other\" and shelved our marriage. The fifth time the lawsuit was inquired about, the Judicial Section Chief questioned me: 'Do you have a marriage certificate?' I explained the origin of our marriage, how I had filed a lawsuit with the original husband, Zhang Xinchun, in Anze County for this wife, and the marriage certificate was lost in the enemy's mopping-up operations, but the Anze County government had stamped it with a \"square seal\" (referring to the county seal) as proof. The section chief was impatient to listen to my words and questioned: 'Who gave you the certificate? You have to take responsibility for casually stamping the square seal!' He said that I 'spent a few years with her in a muddle, and the money you brought doesn't matter!' I said, 'Now, in a democratic government, even stamping the village office's long seal requires responsibility; how can the county government's square seal be stamped casually?' The Judicial Section Chief got angry, slammed the table, and told me to 'get out!' 'Get out!' What could I do? I had to walk out the door. I stood outside the door of the democratic government for a while, unable to understand, and went back in to tell the section chief: 'If you say the certificate issued by Anze County is fake, please write a letter to Anze County government to investigate; I am not afraid of running back and forth.' They ignored me.\"\n　　\"For this matter, I have run back and forth two or three times from Taiyue. The year before last, in October, I obtained the certificate from Anze, returned to the Wu'an County government. At that time, they were busy preparing for war and couldn't take care of resolving my marriage problem, so I wasted a lot of travel expenses and went back. Last March, I brought the certificate from Anze County government and went to the Wu'an County government to demand justice. The civil affairs officials still 'officials protect each other,' shielding the rich peasant thug Wang Wenyi, saying: 'Guo Wenzhang, don't make trouble about this matter anymore. The district has already agreed, and the woman doesn't want to be with you anymore. Mediate a bit and go back!' I thought: The 'democratic government' is not a 'group government,' and it should speak a little bit of justice, and I should at least ask for a reasonable judgment. Who knew that the Civil Affairs Section said, 'Our matter doesn't deserve a judgment.' I heard the people say: 'District Chief Guo is supporting him, how can this lawsuit be won?' Others told me it's best to find the 'real county magistrate' to complain and seek justice. That day, I saw the county magistrate reading the newspaper, so I went to him to tell my grievances, I asked the government to give me a judgment, but the county magistrate didn't resolve it and still told me to go to the section chief to resolve it. I waited in the Judicial Section for two days. The county government issued two official documents to the district office, but they couldn't transfer anyone. I waited in Wu'an until my travel expenses were exhausted, so I had to return to Anze with the official document from Anze County.\"\n　　\"Last year, I returned to my old home in Wu'an, and the only two mu of land at home were also sold, and not a single fruit was distributed to me in the village. I heard from the villagers that the worker Zhang Yurong (phonetic) and District Chief Guo Chaodong were both supporting him in the lawsuit, and I felt that there was no place to speak, so I found the Border Region Government and asked to express my hatred. At that time, the cadres of the Border Region Government were holding a land conference and transferred it to the Taihang Administrative Office, and the official business called on the Wu'an County government to resolve it quickly. The comrades of the Wu'an Judicial Section said that I was restless, thinking that the woman was unwilling to be with me, and offered me 5,000 yuan, later increased to 7,000 yuan, to casually resolve it. I thought that after fighting a lawsuit for two years, I couldn't get the old woman back, and the 30,000 yuan I brought home and the jewelry on the woman's hands were not returned to me, so what democracy is there in this world!? I also sued the Fifth Special Commissioner's Office. The director of the Judicial Office of the Special Commissioner's Office spoke a few fair words for the poor, scolding the director of the agricultural association for using the power of a cadre to threaten and force a woman who fled famine to marry him, which was completely the criminal behavior of a local tyrant and thug. But the director of the Judicial Office came forward to 'mediate,' asking to compensate 80,000 yuan, 'telling me and Wang Cunlan to divorce, and the agricultural association director and my wife to officially form a husband and wife relationship from that day on.' I disagreed in my heart and raised opinions to the government: District Chief Guo Chaodong shielded the cadre, and the Wu'an County government handled it one-sidedly, judging my wife to the thug. I have gone to all the large and small organs, and the result is still that people and money are lost, I am afraid that the people will still not dare to raise their heads, and some bad women will not love the poor, and only look for cadres with power and influence. Such a practice will open a bad road for the new society. The director of the Judicial Office thought that what I said was very reasonable. But he didn't act according to the poor's reasoning! He still told my wife to live with the agricultural association cadre.\"\n　　Guo Wenzhang, a hired poor who had suffered more than 30 years of pain in the old society, ran around everywhere to fight for his human rights and democratic rights, and walked through the doors of democratic governments, and said all the big and small reasons, but still couldn't find a place to speak justice and reason. He requested the people's newspaper to tell the farmer's just demands.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 西井富农干部霸占雇贫老婆　武安政府包庇恶霸  官司打到边府两年还没解决\n\n1948-01-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　西井富农干部霸占雇贫老婆\n  　武安政府包庇恶霸\n    官司打到边府两年还没解决\n    【本报消息】武安西井村雇贫郭文章被富农出身的农会主任霸占了妻子，打官司从区打到专署，打了两年都碰了钉子，各级政府都没有站在阶级立场上解决。这次他来边府告状，并亲至本报要求代笔将他的意见登在报上。事情是这样：\n    郭文章是武安西井村一个雇贫灾民，父子三人给富农王文义家（王文义是富农还是地主出身，还值得重新审查）受苦，租种过九年山地，还替他修过一亩地。每年出一石八斗租子。二十岁后又到山西种山地，家里人不服水土，老婆和兄弟哥嫂都病死了。三十年逃荒到黎城上窑开饭铺，父亲留在老家，把房、地（二亩）卖光也饿死啦。三十二年寻了一个难民妇女王存蓝作对象，由本家哥替他介绍，送到黎城黑虎庙结婚。不久，他们便一同到安泽种山地了。三十五年五月郭文章从安泽县打发老婆回武安，带着三万块钱回西井安家，娘们回去被农会主任王文义瞧见，当作一个好“对象”，扣在地主王世杰家里。急得郭文章的本家叔叔到处寻找。郭说：“当我那娘们露出头来，农会主任已和区长郭朝栋说好婚事，同王文义结婚啦”。\n    他又接着说这件事的来历：旧历五月二十二那天，我从安泽逃荒回来，走到黎城东关碰上俺村农民胡水恒说，俺老婆被干部卡住结婚了。我回家找到村长，问谁作主把俺老婆配给农会主任啦？村长说：“是郭区长作主，俺们村干部都管不了。”当时我就到活水六区公所找赵区长告状，政府把娘们叫到区署押了六天，没理咱就送回去了。俺听人说：村干部上七区投门子，七区郭区长给人家农会主任打气：“保证没不了这个娘们，弄没啦包赔你三个。”郭区长捎一封信就把娘们放回去了。俺又找到赵区长，他说：“这是郭区长手下办的，我管不了。”叫我去找七区公所解决。俺明知郭区长是和村干部一心的，不愿上七区。赵区长还说：“咱管不了，不去随你的便吧！”我没办法，告赵区长说：“你愿管给咱管管，不愿管给咱批到县上去管吧！”我到县政府，头回找到一位女同志，叫咱还回区解决。第二回找到民政科，两个科长，一个问：“谁不讲理办这事呢？”一个说：“是郭朝栋这个老粗（？）办这事可不应该呢？”我说：“可不是不该这样办，他们就这样办了，要不我就来打官司呢？”还是那位女同志说了句良心话：“村干部办的不合理，应该叫娘们来当面解决。”后来司法科问了两趟，科长的心眼变了卦，说：“区公所不能与区公所闹蹩扭，村上不能和村上起矛盾。”人家“官官相卫”，就把咱这婚姻大事抱下啦。官司问到第五趟，司法科长就盘问我：“有没有结婚证？”我声明了俺们结婚的来由，为寻这个老婆曾经与原丈夫张新春在安泽县政府打过官司，结婚证被敌人扫荡无啦，可是安泽县政府盖有“方章”（即指县印）作证明。科长不耐烦听咱的话，追问：“谁给你开的证明，随便按方章，可得负责任呢？”说我“糊里糊涂给人家过了几年，带的那钱可以不必要啦！”我就说：“如今民主政府，按村公所的长章还得负责任，县政府的方章，哪能随便按上呢？”司法科长生气啦，拍开桌子，叫我“出去”！“出去”！咱有啥法，只得走出大门。在民主政府门外站了一会，想不通又进去告诉科长说：“你们说安泽县开的证明是假的，请你开封信到安泽县府去调查，我是不怕来回跑路的。”他们也没理会。\n    为着这件事，俺从太岳又来回奔跑了两三趟。前年十月从安泽办好证明，回到武安县政府，当时正忙着备战，顾不上解决俺的婚姻问题，白花许多路费回去了。去年三月俺又带着安泽县政府的证明，找到武安县府要求声冤，民政科的官老爷们，还是“官官相卫”，包庇富农恶霸王文义，说：“郭文章这事不用再闹了，区上已经说好，娘们也不愿跟你过啦，调解一下还是回去吧！”我想：“民主政府”不是“团体政府”，总得说二分公理，好歹要求一个合理的判决才行，哪知民政科说“咱这事够不上一个判决书。”我听老百姓说：“人家郭区长在顶着门子，这官司怎能打出头呢？”别人告我最好去找着“真（正）县长”才能诉苦声冤。那天我瞧见县长在看报，就去找他诉说咱的冤屈，俺求政府给咱一个判决书，县长没给解决，还是叫我去找科长解决，我又到司法科等了两天。县政府给区公所下了两道公事都调不上人来，我在武安等的把路费都花光了，只好带着安泽县政府的公事返回安泽去了。\n    我去年重回武安老家，家里仅有的二亩土地也卖啦，村中也没分给一点果实。听乡亲们说：工作员张玉戎（音同）和区长郭朝栋都顶着门子给他打官司，感到没有地方好说话，就找到边区政府，要求说理解恨。那时边区政府干部正开土地会议，转到太行行署，去公事叫武安县政府赶快解决。武安司法科同志说我不安分，认为娘们不愿跟我过，包给咱五千块钱，后增到七千元，马虎解决。我想打了二年官司，老波找不回来，连带回家的三万块钱和娘们手上带的首饰也不归还于我，这世道还讲什么民主！？我又告到五专署。专署司法处长给穷人说了几句公道话，训斥农会主任，凭着干部势力，威胁强迫逃荒回家娘们结婚，完全是土豪恶霸犯罪行为。但司法处长又出面“调解”，让包赔八万块钱，“叫我和王存蓝离婚，农会主任和咱老婆从当天起正式成立夫妻关系”。我心里不同意，向政府提出意见：郭朝栋区长包庇干部，武安县政府片面处理，把俺老婆判给恶霸。俺大小机关都走到了，落的结果还是人财两空，恐怕老百姓还是不敢抬头，有些坏妇女还会不爱穷人，专找有权有势的干部，这样干法会对新社会开了一条坏道路。司法处长认为我说的理路很对。可是他没按穷人的道理办事！还是叫咱老婆与农会干部过。\n    在旧社会曾经受过三十多年痛苦生活的雇贫郭文章，为着争取自己的人权和民主权利到处奔跑，走遍了民主政府的大门，大小道理都说遍了，还是找不到一个声冤说理的地方。他要求人民的报纸，诉说一下农民的正义要求。"

Last September, the Taiyue area troops, in order to coordinate with the main force's counter-offensive, launched an enemy-killing competition. The troops of each sub-district, as well as various local corps and guerrilla units, set their enemy-killing plans for the four months from September to December. The four-month enemy-killing plan of the first, second, and third sub-district troops alone was to eliminate four thousand enemies. After the plans were set, each unit hurried to find the enemy and fought many beautiful battles, receiving many commendations from the military region leaders. By the end of December, the three sub-districts had eliminated a total of six thousand seven hundred and sixty-three enemies in four months, killing and wounding two thousand seven hundred and forty-four, and capturing four thousand and nineteen alive. This exceeded the original plan by more than two thousand four hundred. They also seized seven mortars, ten heavy machine guns, one hundred and eighty-two light machine guns, one thousand eight hundred and forty-five rifles, one hundred and twenty-eight pistols, sixteen American submachine guns, forty-one small cannons and grenade launchers, and more than ninety-eight thousand rounds of ammunition. Among them, the first sub-district troops originally planned to eliminate one thousand nine hundred and ten enemies, but because they coordinated with the main force in fighting and undertook special tasks, they also eliminated one thousand three hundred and seventy-four enemies in four months, killing and wounding eight hundred and eighty-nine, and capturing four hundred and eighty-five alive. The second sub-district originally planned to eliminate eight hundred and ten enemies, and completed the four-month plan in fifty days. They eliminated a total of one thousand eight hundred and fifty-one enemies, killing and wounding six hundred and twenty-eight, and capturing one thousand two hundred and twenty-three alive, exceeding the original plan by more than double. The third sub-district eliminated two thousand five hundred and seventy enemies, killing and wounding nine hundred and forty-two, and capturing one thousand six hundred and twenty-eight alive, also exceeding the plan by more than double. There were no large enemy forces within the fourth sub-district's borders long ago. Their task was to clear out bandits and defend the riverfront. They repelled the attack of Zhang Bohua's bandit troops, and successively eliminated two hundred and fifty-five enemies, killing and wounding one hundred and five, and capturing one hundred and fifty alive. The fifth sub-district troops achieved great success in clearing out bandits in the Yuxi new district, making the Yuxi new district more consolidated day by day. In more than two months, they eliminated seven hundred and thirteen enemies, killing and wounding one hundred and eighty, and capturing five hundred and thirty-three alive.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 超过军区杀敌计划的一半　太岳四个月歼敌六千\n\n1948-01-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　超过军区杀敌计划的一半\n  　太岳四个月歼敌六千\n    【太岳消息】太岳军区部队，从九月到十二月四个月内，消灭了六千多敌人，超过原定杀敌计划二千四百多人。去年九月，太岳区的部队要配合大军反攻，就展开了一个杀敌竞赛运动。各分区部队及各地方兵团和游击队，都定了从九月到十二月四个月的杀敌计划，光一、二、三分区部队的四个月杀敌计划，就要消灭四千敌人。计划定出以后，各个部队都赶紧找寻敌人，打了许多漂亮仗，受到军区首长好多次表扬。到十二月底，三个分区四个月共消灭敌人六千七百六十三名，打死打伤二千七百四十四人，活捉四千零十九人。超过原来的计划二千四百多人，还得了迫击炮七门，重机枪十挺，轻机枪一百八十二挺，步枪一千八百四十五支，短枪一百二十八支，美国手提机枪十六挺，小炮和掷弹筒四十一个，子弹九万八千多发，其中分区部队原计划消灭敌人一千九百一十名，因为他配合主力打仗，又担任特别任务，四个月里，也消灭了敌人一千三百七十四人，打死打伤八百八十九人，活捉了四百八十五人。二分区原计划消灭敌人八百一十人，五十天中就完成了四个月的计划，一共消灭了一千八百五十一人，打死打伤六百二十八人，活捉一千二百二十三人，超过原来计划一倍多。三分区消灭敌二千五百七十人，打死打伤九百四十二人，活捉了一千六百二十八人，也超过计划一倍以上。四分区境内早就没有了大股敌人，他们是清剿土匪，保卫河防，曾经打退张伯华匪部的进攻，先后消灭了敌人二百五十五人，打死打伤一百零五人，活捉一百五十人。五分区部队在豫西新区清剿土匪，得到很大成绩，使豫西新区一天比一天巩固，两个多月的工夫，消灭了七百一十三个敌人，打死打伤一百八十人，活捉五百三十三人。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th: Under the leadership of the Inner Mongolia Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, the land reform movement and various construction works in Inner Mongolia have developed rapidly in the past year. In this grassland, which stretches east from Hinggan League, west to Xilingol League, south from Jirem League, and north to Hulunbuir, encompassing twelve leagues, seventy-nine banners, and two million people, the vast number of hired peasants and herdsmen, after settling accounts and seeking revenge against feudal nobles and landlord-herdowners, have weakened and struck at feudal forces and become the masters of Inner Mongolia. On October 25th of last year, the people of the West Khorchin Rear Banner held a full-banner mass struggle meeting, overthrowing over fifty feudal despots, including the feudal leader and major Mongolian traitor Shou Ming'a, hereditary banner chief Bayin Namuer, and imperial relative Su Kehtu. The Mongolian traitor and Chiang Kai-shek special agent \"Prince\" Delegerli and the major despot \"Prince\" Ye of the West Khorchin Central Banner were also thoroughly defeated under the high hatred of the people of the entire banner. According to incomplete statistics from thirteen districts of the Dorbod Front Banner: more than 2,700 feudal despots and landlords have been overthrown, and 94,000 hectares of land, more than 29,000 houses, more than 12,000 livestock, and more than 3,000 plows have returned to the hands of 13,183 hired peasants and poor farmers, with an average of 5 hectares of land, one and a half houses, and livestock, farm tools, and clothing per household.\n\nAfter the emancipation of the farmers and herdsmen, production is very active, and agriculture, industry, and commerce are becoming increasingly prosperous. Collective salt transportation, haymaking, and mutual labor exchange have become a common practice. Many places have established cooperatives and factories for iron, wood, leather, soap, wool weaving, and livestock farms. Ulanhot (i.e., Wangye Temple), the capital of Inner Mongolia, has more than 1,400 stores and several large shopping malls. Many small stores can earn more than 7,000 yuan a day (each yuan is equivalent to 25 yuan of Kuomintang currency).\n\nThe development of education in various leagues and banners is also very rapid. In the West Khorchin Rear Banner, there were only five primary schools during the puppet Manchukuo period, but now it has developed to 115 schools with more than 3,900 students. Emancipated farmers and herdsmen in various places have sent their children to school one after another. The West Khorchin Front Banner has more than 220 schools with 9,000 students, an increase of seventeen times compared to 1946. Specialized schools in Ulanhot City include the First Branch of the Inner Mongolia Military and Political University, the Second Branch of the Military and Political University in Qiqihar, the Mongolian Autonomous School in Chifeng, the branch school of the Autonomous School in Lindong, and eight institutions including the Higher Institute, Industrial Institute, and Inner Mongolia Medical College in Hailar. Secondary schools include Ulanhot Municipal Middle School, Solun Youth School, and Zalantun Naven Middle School. In the large-scale mass movement last year, a large number of students from various schools went to the countryside to participate in work. The youth movement, with the Inner Mongolia People's Revolutionary Youth League as its backbone, has also expanded from cities and schools to the peasant and herdsmen masses. Each banner and district has an organization of the Youth League, and there are now more than 3,000 members.\n\nCultural publishing undertakings have also experienced unprecedented development in the past year. The Han Chinese \"Inner Mongolia Autonomous Daily\" in Ulanhot City has been changed from an every-other-day publication to the \"Inner Mongolia Daily.\" In addition, there is the Mongolian \"Inner Mongolia Autonomous Daily,\" the \"Hulunbuir New News\" in Hailar, and the \"Prairie Road\" and \"Education Semimonthly\" in the West Khorchin Central Banner, the \"Warrior News\" in Jirem League, the \"Advance News\" of the Inner Mongolia Self-Defense Army, the \"Emancipation News\" of the Gorlos Banner, and the \"Mass Ten-Day Publication\" of the Morin Dawa Banner.\n\nUnder the leadership and call of Chairman Yunze, medical research institutes or clinics have been established successively in the West Khorchin Rear and Central Banners, Dorbod Banner, Naven Muren League, and other places, and simple treatment centers have been set up in each district. Ulanhot City has specifically established a medical college, a medical personnel training institute, a health technology research institute, and a Lama medical school. In the past, most people suffering from infectious diseases have received treatment.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 一年来的新内蒙建设\n\n1948-01-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　一年来的新内蒙建设\n    【新华社东北十五日电】在中共内蒙古工作委员会和内蒙古自治政府领导下的内蒙古，去年土地改革运动和各种建设工作，发展极快。在此东起兴安盟、西至锡林郭勒盟、南自哲里木盟、北达呼伦贝尔包括十二个盟、七十九个旗，二百万人口的草原上，广大的雇贫农和牧民，经过向封建贵族和地主牧主进行清算复仇斗争后，已削弱和打击了封建势力，做了内蒙的主人。西科后旗人民去年十月二十五日曾经召开全旗人民大斗争会，把封建头子、大蒙奸寿明阿和世袭旗长巴音那木尔、皇亲苏克图等五十多个封建恶霸一齐斗倒。西科中旗蒙奸蒋特“王爷”德勒格尔利大恶霸叶“王爷”等，也在全旗人民的高度仇恨下被彻底打垮。据都尔罗斯前旗十三个区的不完全统计：已有二千七百多封建恶霸地主被斗倒，有九万四千垧土地，二万九千多间房子，一万二千多匹牲口，三千多付犁杖回到了一万三千一百八十三家的雇贫农手里，平均每家可得到五垧地，一间半房子及牲畜农具衣服等。\n    农牧民翻身后，生产非常积极，农工商业均日趋繁荣，集体运盐，打洋草，互相变工，已成为风气。许多地方已成立合作社和铁、木、皮革、肥皂、毛织等工厂和家畜牧场。内蒙首府乌兰浩特市（即王爷庙）有一千四百多家商店，和几个大商场。许多小商店，每天都可盈利七千多元左右（每元合蒋币二十五元）。\n    各盟旗的教育发展也很快。西科后旗在伪满时候，只有五所小学校，现已发展到一百十五所，有学生三千九百多人，各地翻身农民牧民，都纷纷送子弟入学。西科前旗有学校二百二十多所，学生九千人，比一九四六年增加了十七倍。专科学校乌兰浩特市有内蒙军政大学第一院，齐齐哈尔有军政大学第二院，赤峰有蒙古自治学校，林东有自治学校分校，和海拉尔的高等学院，工业学院，内蒙医学院等八处。中等学校有乌兰浩特市立中学，索伦青年学校，扎兰屯纳文中学等。在去年大规模的群众运动中，各校学生都大批的下乡参加工作。以内蒙人民革命青年团为骨干的青年运动，也已从城市和学校扩大到农民牧民群众中去，各旗各区，都有青年团的组织，现在已有团员三千多人。\n    文化出版事业，在过去一年中也有空前的发展。乌兰浩特市的汉文“内蒙自治报”已由隔日刊改为“内蒙古日报”。此外还有蒙文的“内蒙自治报”，海拉尔的“呼伦贝尔新报”，和西科中旗“草原之路”“教育半月刊”，哲里木盟的“战士报”，内蒙自卫军的“挺进报”，郭尔罗斯旗的“翻身报”，莫力达瓦旗的“大众旬刊”等。\n    卫生事业，在云泽主席的领导和号召下，西科后、中两旗，杜尔伯特旗，纳文慕仁盟等地都已先后成立医学研究所或诊疗所，每个区并设有简易治疗所。乌兰浩特市专门开办了医学院，医务人员养成所，卫生技术研究所和喇嘛医学校等，过去大多数害传染病的人都得到了救治。"

The captured spoils included 4 artillery pieces, 50 light and heavy machine guns, 2,658 long and short guns, more than 200,000 rounds of ammunition, 6,750 war horses, and many other military supplies. One enemy plane was shot down, and 93 strongholds were recovered. In all battles, the Self-Defense Army units demonstrated the valiant fighting traditions of the Mongolian people. In a battle against an enemy security brigade in May last year, a unit of the Jerim League Frontline Self-Defense Army created a glorious record of zero casualties versus 320 enemy casualties. In July last year, another unit completely routed the entire 3rd Division of the enemy's newly formed 1st Cavalry Army in three consecutive battles, killing 120 enemy soldiers including a regimental commander and capturing 534 enemy soldiers including regimental commanders Li Kuangmin and Li Xianba. During the Autumn Offensive, the unit's cavalry breached the Beining Railway three times, completely demolishing more than 20 miles of railway tracks in six hours. Over the past year, the Self-Defense Army has also cooperated with the Chahar Iron Cavalry, operating behind enemy lines, smashing Fu bandit's large-scale \"mopping-up\" operations in June and July, suppressing the Fu bandit's collusion with Inner Mongolian reactionaries to plot rebellion, and annihilating the Fu bandit forces in Habaga, a northern key town of Baoyuan, three times. They also completely annihilated the Fu bandit forces east of Xianghuang Banner of Chahar and East Sonid. The Shangdu and Huade armed work teams persisted in and opened up a vast guerrilla area of approximately 2,000 square miles, 400 miles long and 50 miles wide, north of Shangdu, Huade, Kangbao, and Baoyuan, controlling key military locations such as Maodu north of Shangdu, Liuzhijian north of Huade, Zhanggaixue north of Kangbao, and Habaga north of Baoyuan. A certain Inner Mongolian cavalry unit, galloping through the Bayantala and Ulanqab leagues, contained the defense forces of seven counties of Fu bandit, and successively destroyed 42 puppet regimes, restoring a vast area of eastern and western 500 miles, north and south 300 miles, with a population of hundreds of thousands in the two leagues.

    "content": "From Lingchuan: Since the establishment of the Yutou Village Cooperative in Pingcheng District, Lingchuan, it has been more than four months. Every day, it loudly proclaims \"serving the masses,\" but in its work, it serves the landlords and supports a group of targets of struggle. There are sixteen people in the cooperative, and ten are targets of struggle. Even the traitorous landlords Li Yinlong and Wang Yuanhai, and the rich peasant Wang Hebao (whose two sons are Kuomintang bandit regiment leaders under Ji Zhenkui), have wormed their way into the cooperative, eating and drinking extravagantly. When the masses encounter them, they cover up by saying, \"We are saving white flour.\" The manager, Su Shuizhen, eats at the cooperative, is irresponsible in her work, lives in a good house, and her home is furnished like a landlord's, and she cultivates good land. The accountant, Wang Cuiyu, is an old Kuomintang member from 1925 who supported the enemy and oppressed the masses when the enemy was present. Because the cadres shielded him, he was not thoroughly criticized and struggled against. Now he has a nice flowered quilt, a felt mat, wears glasses, and is fat and well-fed. The masses say, \"We carry loads down to Hejian, and we can't even earn a few thousand yuan after a hard winter. People sitting in the cooperative don't have to worry about food and clothing and enjoy happiness.\" The cooperative's shares were purchased with five hundred silver dollars seized during last year's \"cutting the tail of capitalism\" campaign, which were exchanged for 300,000 Jibi. Many good pieces of furniture were also placed in the cooperative, not to be distributed to the masses. The village cadres falsely claimed in the name of the district and county committees that the county and district had approved that they could not be divided. When sowing wheat this year, the bank lent Yutou 50,000 yuan to help the masses sow wheat, but the cooperative used it for business, buying fourteen shi of wheat seeds and lending them to the masses with interest. Each dou of wheat had to be repaid with one dou and three sheng of millet, forcing the masses to repay. The cooperative's oil mill buys the masses' hemp seeds at low prices. While millet sells for 1,300 yuan per dou in the market, it can only be sold for 1,000 yuan per dou in the village, forcing the masses to sell. The deputy manager, Wu Wenliang, secretly manipulates things to buy it at a low price for his own family. The deputy manager went to Changzhi to buy cotton ginning machines and to Yincheng to sell hemp for private production. Last autumn, when the masses were about to change seasons, the cadres prohibited the export of rice and cloth. Henan people came to sell cloth, and each dou of rice could buy six chi of cloth, but the cooperative did not allow the masses to buy it. The cooperative bought it all and then sold it to the masses for four chi per dou of rice. During the \"cutting the tail of capitalism\" campaign last year, nearly a thousand jin of vegetables were confiscated from the autumn land, which were all eaten by the cooperative. The masses are extremely dissatisfied with the cooperative, saying that the cooperative is supporting targets of struggle. The cadres in charge of the cooperative even say, \"Hiring poor people who are illiterate and can't do business is useless,\" and that \"the basic masses are not easy to command; they do whatever the targets of struggle tell them to do!\" Such cooperative cadres who only serve landlords and ride on the backs of the people should be abolished quickly.\n\n　　(Fu Fang)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冶头村地主钻进合作社　统制粮布买卖专为地主发财\n傅芳\n1948-01-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冶头村地主钻进合作社\n  　统制粮布买卖专为地主发财\n    【陵川消息】陵川平城区冶头村合作社成立以来，已近四个月有余，每天高唱“为群众服务”，但工作上都是为地主服务，养活一群斗争对象。合作社里有十六个人，斗争对象就占十个，连奸伪地主李银龙、王原孩，富农王和保（两儿在姬镇魁那里当汉奸团长），也钻进合作社里，大吃大喝，群众碰见了，他们便掩盖说：“我们节省下白面了。”经理苏水珍在合作社吃饭，办事不负责任，住着好房，家里摆的和地主一样，种的是好地。管帐王崔玉是民国十四年的老国民党员，敌人在时维持敌人，欺压群众，因干部包庇，没啦斗透，现在盖的好花被子，铺的毡，戴着眼镜，吃的红白大胖，身不摇臂不动。群众说：“咱担挑下合涧，辛苦一冬也赚不了几千元，人家坐在合作社不愁吃穿享幸福。”合作社里的股金是用去年割尾巴斗出来的五百元银元，兑了冀票三十万元。许多好家具也放到合作社，不让群众分。村干部们私架区委县委名义，说是县区批准不能分。在今年种麦时银行贷给冶头五万元，帮助群众种麦，合作社用了做买卖，买了十四石麦种，借给群众还要生利。每斗麦要一斗三升小米，逼着群众归还。合作社开的油坊贱买群众麻籽。到市上每斗小米是一千三百元，在村只能卖一千元，强迫群众非卖不行，卖给后副经理吴文良从中捣鬼低价买到他家。副经理到长治买了弹花车，又到荫城贩麻作成私人生产。去年秋季群众正要换季时，干部禁止米布出口。河南人上来卖布，每斗米能买六尺布，可是合作社不叫群众买，合作社全部买了，又每斗米四尺卖给群众。在去年割尾巴时斗争出秋地收了将近千余斤菜，全由合作社吃了。群众对合作社极为不满，都说合作社是养活斗争对象。在合作社负责的干部，还说是“雇贫不识字，不会做买卖”，还说是“基本群众不好使唤，斗争对象叫他怎样，他怎样！”象这种专为地主办事骑在人民头上的合作社干部，应该赶快取消。　　（傅芳）"

The agreement stipulates that the United States will sell 250 aircraft to Chiang Kai-shek, establish aircraft repair factories in Chiang Kai-shek's controlled areas, and the US imperialists will supplement equipment for Chiang Kai-shek's airports in various places.

According to Lin Bao Luo, Secretary-General of the Chinese Christian Student Association in North America, in late September of last year, more than a hundred students studying in the United States gathered on the shores of Lake Geneva in Wisconsin to protest the Kuomintang government's trampling of the Chinese people's civil rights and demanded that the US government stop financial and military aid to the Kuomintang. Another meeting of students held in Conferens, Connecticut, passed resolutions demanding that the United States stop aiding the Kuomintang's civil war, abolish the \"Sino-American Commercial Treaty,\" oppose any peace treaty with Japan that would aid Japan in restoring its pre-war aggression, and oppose American discrimination against Chinese people in the United States. Furthermore: In October of last year, the All-China Student Federation sent a letter to American students, calling on them to fight to stop the US government's continued aid to the Kuomintang. The letter pointed out that the Chinese civil war is the result of American aid to Chiang Kai-shek's aggression against China.

It is said that they had originally engraved several New Year pictures such as \"Sending Food\" and \"New Door Gods.\" After the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau pointed out their shortcomings, they immediately convened a review meeting for the art group comrades and resolutely stopped printing those flawed pictures. After careful study and research, they engraved new ones. Their spirit of daring to correct mistakes, and preferring to sacrifice their own energy and resources rather than making political mistakes, is worthy of praise.

    "content": "Taihang and Taiyue Administrative Offices Issue Public Notice:\n　　Strictly Prohibiting the Sabotage of the Land Law\n　　[Report from this newspaper] After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law of China and the supplementary measures for the implementation of the Outline Land Law by the border government, the vast number of peasants in the border area, especially the hired and poor peasants, were very happy, sincerely supported it, and prepared to implement it thoroughly immediately. However, many landlords, rich peasants, and all lawbreakers deliberately misinterpreted the Outline Land Law, provoked disunity between hired/poor peasants and middle peasants, transferred, concealed, and dispersed property, and sold and wasted illegally obtained fruits of struggle. These criminal acts of sabotaging the Outline Land Law seriously violated the interests of the peasants. The Taihang Administrative Office has therefore issued a public notice, pointing out: (1) The Outline Land Law is based on the demands of the peasants to thoroughly abolish the feudal and semi-feudal land exploitation system and to satisfy the demands of landless, land-poor, and hired peasants. Landlords and rich peasants must not deliberately misinterpret, provoke, or carry out property transfers and other destructive activities. Those who violate this, once verified by the government, will be severely punished. (2) The land and property of middle peasants, only the surplus land of prosperous middle peasants can be voluntarily extracted through consultation, and their movable property and household property will not be touched. The land and property of other middle peasants will not be touched. Lower-middle peasants can also share the fruits of the struggle. Do not listen to the rumors and provocations of those who struggle against middle peasants. All middle peasants should rise up against such rumors and provocations, concentrate on production and thrift, and maintain close unity with hired and poor peasants. (3) Cadres who occupy too much of the fruits of struggle must return all the excess when the land is equally divided. Before the equal distribution of land, it shall not be transferred, sold, destroyed or wasted. Those who violate this shall, in addition to returning the excess at the time of equal distribution, be punished according to the seriousness of the circumstances. (4) All peasants have the right to file complaints with governments at all levels regarding the above-mentioned illegal acts once discovered, and governments at all levels must investigate and deal with them based on the facts. District and village cadres must not suppress this democratic right of the people. Those who violate this shall be guilty of violating the Outline Land Law.\n　　The Taiyue Administrative Office also issued a public notice on the 13th, deciding: (1) During the implementation of the Outline Land Law, all illegal acts such as illegal sales, dispersal, and transfer of land and property are strictly prohibited. (2) No individual, organization, or group may arbitrarily slaughter livestock, cut down trees, or destroy all farm implements, water conservancy projects, and buildings for the purpose of obstructing fair distribution. (3) If any of the above-mentioned illegal acts are found, in addition to confiscating all land and property (to be distributed to landless and land-poor peasants during equal distribution), both buyers and sellers will be sent to the People's Court for severe punishment according to law. (4) All peasants, peasant associations, and poor peasant groups, especially poor and hired peasants, should immediately be vigilant and closely monitor these illegal acts of landlords and rich peasants. If such circumstances occur, they should interfere on the one hand and immediately report to the local county and district governments and peasant associations on the other hand, in order to smash the obstruction and sabotage of these illegal elements. (5) Local governments and peasant associations should accept peasants' accusations and severely punish any illegal elements.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行、太岳行署发出布告　严禁破坏土地法\n\n1948-01-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行、太岳行署发出布告\n  　严禁破坏土地法\n    【本报消息】中国土地法大纲和边府实施土地法大纲补充办法公布后，边区广大农民，特别是雇贫农民十分高兴，衷心拥护，并准备立即彻底实行。但有不少地主富农及一切不法分子故意曲解土地法大纲，挑拨雇贫与中农的团结，转移、隐蔽与分散财产，变卖与浪费非法获得的斗争果实。这些破坏土地法大纲的罪恶行为，严重的违害了农民利益。太行行署特为此发出布告，指出：（一）土地法大纲是根据农民的要求，彻底废除封建性的半封建性的土地剥削制度，满足无地少地雇贫农民的要求。地主富农不得故意曲解、挑拨或进行转移财产及其他破坏活动。违者经政府查之有据，定当严加惩处。（二）中农的土地财产，只富裕中农多余的土地可以协商方式，由其自愿抽出，其浮财及房屋内财一律不动。其他中农的土地财产，一律不动。下中农并可分得斗争果实。不要听信斗争中农的造谣、挑拨，所有中农均应起来反对这种造谣和挑拨的行为，安心生产节约，并保持与雇贫农民的密切团结。（三）干部多占的斗争果实，在平分土地时必须将多占部分全部退出。在未进行平分土地前，不得转移、变卖、破坏或浪费。违者除平分土地时仍须将多占部分照数退出外，并按其情节轻重，给予处罚。（四）对以上各项违法行为，所有农民，一经发现后均有权利向各级政府提出控诉，各级政府定当据实查究。区村干部不得压制这种人民民主权利。违者以违背土地法大纲论罪。\n    太岳行署也于十三日发出布告，决定：（一）在实行土地法大纲期间，严格禁止一切违法变卖、分散、转移土地财产等不法行为。（二）不论任何个人机关或团体，不得为着妨碍公平分配之目的而任意宰杀牲口，砍伐树木，及破坏一切农具、水利、建筑等。（三）如有上述违法行为者，一经查出，除土地财产一律没收（平分时分给无地少地农民）外，买卖人员都要送交人民法庭依法严惩。（四）一切农民、农会、贫农团特别是贫农雇农立即警惕起来，严密监视地主富农的这些不法行为，如若发生此种情事，应一面干涉，一面立即向当地县区政府与农会告发，以粉碎这些不法分子的阻碍破坏。（五）各地政府、农会应接受农民的告发，并对任何非法分子予以严惩。"

    "content": "The Taihang Xinhua Daily Calls for Overcoming Misinterpretations of the Land Law\n\n[This Newspaper's News] The Taihang Xinhua Daily published an editorial on the 15th, entitled \"Overcoming Misinterpretations and Misunderstandings of the Land Law Outline.\" The gist of it said: Recently, it has been discovered that a small number of landlord elements, after the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, are taking advantage of the fact that the masses have not yet taken action and the propaganda has not yet penetrated deeply, attempting to provoke disunity among the masses, create chaos, and launch a counter-offensive; or using the excuse that landlords also get a share, threatening the masses by saying that past struggles were wrong; or provoking the unity of middle peasants and poor peasants, saying that future equal distribution will involve dividing the land and property of middle peasants; saying that equal distribution means taking everything everyone owns and dividing it on the street; or intimidating some cadres and activists who have taken too many gains in the past, saying that they will be struggled against in the future; even colluding with a small number of bad elements and corrupt officials who have encroached on the gains of the masses, establishing fake \"Poor Peasants' Associations\" and \"Poor and Hired Peasants Committees.\" It must be pointed out that these are all conspiracies of a small number of landlord elements, attempts by a small number of local elements to use the low cultural level of the masses or the insufficient mobilization, and to exploit certain weaknesses of cadres and activists, to carry out restorationist criminal acts. The peasants and leading organs throughout the region must pay close attention to these conspiracies and tricks. If they do not cease their activities, the government organs will arrest them according to the law when the equal distribution movement begins, and they will be prosecuted.\n\nDue to the rumors and sabotage of a small number of landlords and bad elements, misunderstandings and unrest have been caused among a section of the masses (especially middle peasants), resulting in phenomena of excessive eating and drinking, wasting property, not engaging in production, and waiting for equal distribution. This is extremely harmful. The policy of equal distribution of land is only to confiscate the land and property of landlords, requisition the surplus land and property of rich peasants, and distribute it to peasants who lack these things (poor peasants, hired peasants, rural workers, and a portion of middle peasants); for well-to-do middle peasants, it is only through consultation and with their consent that they voluntarily contribute a portion of their surplus land. The property, farm tools, livestock, and other movable property of well-to-do middle peasants will not be touched at all, and ordinary middle peasants will not suffer any losses, while lower-middle peasants can even get some land and property. The basic spirit of the Land Law Outline is to completely eliminate feudalism, satisfy the demands of hired and poor peasants, and at the same time, firmly unite the middle peasants. We advise those middle peasant masses who misunderstand the Land Law Outline or have been incited by landlord elements to stop this waste and continue to work diligently in production with peace of mind.\n\nAs for the small number of landlords, rich peasants, and a small number of bad elements who have encroached on the gains of the masses, wasting, dispersing, and selling things that should be taken out in the future is a criminal act and will be prosecuted in the future.\n\nThere are also a small number of cadres who have taken too many gains in the turnaround movement, stubbornly insist on their mistakes, do not want to withdraw the over-occupied portion according to the law, and in order to maintain this portion of the gains, have already taken some improper measures, such as infringing on middle peasants, expanding the scope of struggle, indiscriminate killings, etc. Now that they hear that there will be equal distribution, they are afraid of taking out their over-occupied gains, afraid that landlords and rich peasants will also get a share, and want to take the opportunity to launch a round of indiscriminate struggle before the equal distribution, sacrificing others to preserve the over-occupied gains. This is detrimental to poor peasants, and it is also a criminal act, which must be strictly stopped. Indiscriminate struggle and indiscriminate killing are no longer allowed to occur. If illegal killings occur, they must be severely punished according to the law.\n\nIn addition, at present, villages are brewing the division of classes, and many deviations have occurred in this issue. The main problem is the excessive expansion of the proportion of landlords and rich peasants - \"tracing three generations,\" \"weighing Du Lu\" (such as one landlord family being divided into forty families, and all forty families being counted as landlords), etc. Even some villages have landlords and rich peasants accounting for 20% to 30% of the population, and individual villages even reaching 60%, which is very dangerous. Due to such a division, many masses (even hired and poor peasants) have become uneasy. We tell the peasants throughout the region: these divisions do not count now. In the future, after the equal distribution begins, they will all be divided according to unified regulations. \"Tracing three generations\" and \"weighing Du Lu\" will not be done. The class component of each household must be discussed and approved by the masses. If the village cannot make a clear division or if they have opinions themselves, they can also submit it to the district, county, or agricultural representatives' conferences above the district and county for discussion and decision.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行新华日报号召　克服对土地法的曲解\n\n1948-01-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行新华日报号召\n  　克服对土地法的曲解\n    【本报消息】太行新华日报在十五日发表了一篇社论，题目叫作“克服对于土地法大纲的曲解和误解”。大意说：近来发现少数地主分子，在土地法大纲公布之后，利用群众尚未行动起来，宣传尚未深入的空子，企图挑拨群众团结，制造混乱现象，进行反攻；或借口地主也分一份，威胁群众说过去斗争错了；或挑拨中农和贫农的团结，说将来平分要分中农的土地财产；说平分就是把各家所有的东西都拿到街上来分；或恐吓某些过去多占果实的干部积极分子，说将来要斗争他们；甚或拉拢少数侵占群众果实的坏分子和贪污腐化分子，成立假“贫农团”、“贫雇委员会”。必须指出这都是少数地主分子的阴谋，是少数地方分子企图利用群众文化程度低或发动不充分，利用干部积极分子的某些弱点，来进行复辟的犯罪行为。对于这种阴谋诡计，全区农民和领导机关必须严密注视，如果他们不停止活动，必要时政府机关即依法逮捕，在平分运动开始之后必将加以究办。\n    由于少数地主及少数坏分子的造谣破坏，引起了一部分群众（特别是中农）的误解与动荡，发生大吃大喝，浪费财物，不事生产，坐待平分的现象，这是极端有害的。平分土地的政策只是没收地主的土地财产，征收富农多余的土地财产，分给缺少这些东西的农民（贫农、雇农、乡村工人及一部分中农）；对于富裕中农，也只是用协商的办法，取得他们的同意，自动献出多余的一部分土地，富裕中农的财产、农具、牲口等浮财是丝毫不动的，至于一般的中农则更是不会有任何损失的，下中农还可分到一些土地财产。土地法大纲的基本精神是要彻底消灭封建，满足雇贫要求，同时是坚固的团结中农的。我们劝告这些误解土地法大纲或受了地主分子煽动的中农群众，停止这种浪费，继续安心的努力生产。\n    至于少数地主富农和少数侵占群众果实的坏分子，现在浪费、分散、出卖了将来应该拿出来的东西，这是犯罪行为，将来是要究办的。\n    还有少数干部人员，在翻身运动中，多占了斗争果实，始终坚持自己的错误，不想依法退出多占部分，并且为了保持这一部分果实，已经采取了一些不正当的办法，如侵害中农，扩大斗争面，乱杀人………等等。现在听说要平分，恐怕拿出自己多占果实，恐怕给地主富农也分一份，又想在平分以前，趁机先乱斗一阵，牺牲别人，来保存多占果实，这是对贫苦农民不利的，这也是犯罪行为，必须严厉制止。再不允许发生乱斗乱杀的现象，如果发生违法杀人的事件一定要依法严惩。\n    此外，现在各个村庄，都在酝酿划分阶级，在这一问题上，也发生了很多偏向，主要的问题是过份扩大了地主富农的比重——“追三代”、“掂都芦”（如一家地主分成四十家，四十家都算地主）………，甚至有些村庄地主富农占了户口百分之二十至三十，个别村庄竟占到百分之六十，这是十分危险的。由于这样的划法，引起了许多群众（甚至雇贫）的不安。我们告诉全区的农民：现在这些划法都不算数，将来平分开始以后，都按照统一的规定来划，不“追三代”，不“掂都芦”，每户的阶级成份都要在群众中讨论通过，村里划不清或自己有意见的还可以提交区、县或区县以上的农代会讨论决定。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 13th: According to consolidated reports from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas, the people's armed forces in Fujian and Jiangxi provinces have shown significant development over the past year, numbering nearly ten thousand by the end of last year. Among them, there are eleven units in Fujian, totaling at least over seven thousand, with a wide range of activities. The main ones are: (1) One unit on the Fujian-Guangdong-Jiangxi border, which had only a little over one hundred men with guns in the autumn of 1946, connected with the people's armed forces in Rao Ping and other counties in Guangdong Province. Their guerrilla area was limited to Zhao'an and Yunxiao counties, but now it has expanded tenfold. Their area of activity has also expanded to Zhangpu, Longxi, and the bordering areas of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces, including Heping, Yongding, Shanghang, Wuping, Changting, Ninghua, and the mountainous areas of Liancheng, Longyan, and other counties. The leader is Huang Shicheng, who has now established the Fujian-Guangdong Border Region Command. They have put forward the slogan of \"Oppose the Three Levies (referring to grain requisition, forced loans, and conscription), eradicate local tyrants,\" and launched mass struggles. (2) The Yandang Mountain troops in the Zhejiang-Fujian border region, whose area of activity in Fujian Province includes Fuding, Fu'an, Xiapu, Lianjiang, Shouning, Ningde, Pingnan, and other counties. In addition, the peasants in the aforementioned counties established the \"Fujian People's Livelihood Team\" last year, with as many as twelve teams. (3) In central Fujian Province, Chiang-controlled newspapers reported in the lower half of 1946 that there were \"economic guerrillas\" composed of demobilized New Fourth Army soldiers, including Chen Gu Lao's unit with over a hundred men, Liu Runshi's unit with over a hundred men, and other units, active along the Min River. Now, a military sub-district command has been established in central Fujian, with Huang Guozhang as the commander. The Daiyun Mountains area has the Daiyun Column and Wang's unit. The three units have now merged and are launching movements such as \"Oppose Chiang and resist grain collection\" and \"Open warehouses to distribute grain\" in the vast rural areas under the jurisdiction of Yongchun, Dehua, Xianyou, Putian, Nan'an, Jinjiang, Hui'an, Tong'an, Anxi, and other counties. They are also organizing the \"Strong Men's Grand Alliance\" against conscription. In addition to the aforementioned counties, there are other peasant and fisherman units active in the northern Chong'an, Pucheng, and the sea areas bordering Fujian and Zhejiang.\n\nJiangxi: There are more than ten peasant uprising armed forces, with at least two thousand people, active in Yongxin and Lianhua, near the Jinggang Mountains, the birthplace of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Jiangxi-Hunan border, including the peasant armed forces Monkey Team, Climbing Team, No Heaven Team, and He Xiguang's unit. Along the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway, in De'an, Jiujiang, and other counties, and in various places on the east bank of Poyang Lake, there were several armed units composed of peasants, righteous people from the War of Resistance, and anti-war soldiers from the Chiang army in 1946, each with hundreds of people, and equipped with weapons such as flat-trajectory guns. In the Poyang Lake area, they even raised a white flag reading \"Officials force the people to rebel.\" Since last year, various units along the Nanchang-Xunyang Highway have attacked Chiang bandit transport vehicles at any time. In Dayu, Longnan, Xunwu, and other counties on the Guangdong-Jiangxi border, there were already some small units active in 1946. Now, they have joined forces with the people's armed forces in Nanxiong and other counties in northern Guangdong, becoming a powerful large force. Guangfeng County on the Jiangxi-Zhejiang-Fujian border is said to be an important stronghold of the people's armed forces in Zhejiang and Fujian, with Zeng Jingbing leading troops stationed there.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 官逼民反开仓库分赋谷　闽赣农民武装反蒋\n\n1948-01-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　官逼民反开仓库分赋谷\n  　闽赣农民武装反蒋\n    【新华社陕北十三日电】综合蒋区报刊消息：闽、赣两省人民武装，一年来有显著发展，截至去年底已近万人。其中福建十一部，总数至少七千余，活动地区甚广。主要的是：（一）闽粤赣边境一部，四六年秋仅有人枪一百余，与粤境饶平等县人民武装联系，游击地区也限于诏安、云霄两县，现已扩大十倍，活动地区也扩大至漳浦、龙溪及闽粤赣三省边境的和平、永定、上杭、武平、长汀、宁化及平山区的连城、龙严等县。领袖为黄士诚，现已设立闽粤边区司令部。提出“反三征（指征粮、征借、征兵）、铲土劣”口号，发动群众斗争。（二）浙闽边区雁荡山部队，其在闽境的活动地区，有福鼎、福安、霞浦、连江、寿宁、宁德、屏南等县。此外，上述各县农民，去年曾建立“福建人民谋生队”，达十二队之多。（三）闽省中部，四六年下季蒋区报纸即载称：有新四军退伍军人组成的“经济游击队”陈牯老部百余，刘润世部百余及另部，活跃于闽江沿岸一带。现闽中已建立军分区司公部，司令为黄国璋，戴云山区有戴云纵队、及王某所部，三部刻已汇合，在永春、德化、仙游、莆田、南安、晋江、惠安、同安、安溪等县辖境广大农村发动“反蒋抗缴”、“开仓库分赋谷”等运动，并组织反征兵的“壮丁大同盟”。上列县份及北部崇安、浦城与闽浙交界海面尚有其他农民、渔民等部队活动。\n    江西：有民变武装十部以上，至少二千人，活动于永新及赣湘边境中国人民解放军发祥地井冈山北麓之莲花一带的有农民武装猴子队、爬山队、无天队及贺喜光等部。南浔路沿线德安、九江等县及＠阳湖东岸各地四六年已有由农民、抗战中之义民及蒋军反战士兵组成之武装若干部，每部数百人，且有平射炮等武器；湖东一带尚打出“官逼民反”白旗。去年以来南浔公路沿线各部随时出袭蒋匪运输车辆。赣粤边大庾、龙南、寻邬等县四六年即有若干小部活动，现已与粤北南雄等县人民武装汇合，成为有力之大队伍。赣浙闽边广丰县，据称为浙闽人民武装重要据点之一，有曾镜冰率部驻屯。"

These developments are mainly manifested in: (1) The establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, achieving preliminary victory in autonomy; (2) The Inner Mongolia People's Self-Defense Army actively participated in the great counteroffensive, cooperating with the People's Liberation Army in pursuing and annihilating the Chiang, Chen, and Fu bandits from the periphery of Shenyang to the Suiyuan-Mongolia region, jointly liberating the Mongolian people oppressed by the Chiang bandits; (3) Poor farmers and herdsmen in the autonomous region began to turn over in the struggle of anti-traitors, land clearing and distribution; (4) The establishment of the Inner Mongolia Communist Party Working Committee, making the Inner Mongolia national liberation struggle have a clear leadership core. However, these foundations are not yet solid. In order to strive for new victories in the new situation, overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, and liberate the entire nation, Chairman Yun Ze put forward several policy guidelines for this year: (1) Realize equal land distribution, thoroughly eliminate feudalism, establish the advantage of hired and poor peasants in agricultural areas, unite with middle peasants, eliminate feudal exploitation in pastoral areas, improve the lives of herdsmen, and allow free grazing; (2) Promote the heroic and skilled fighting spirit and equestrian specialties of the Inner Mongolia cavalry, learn and resolutely support land reform, and expand the cavalry units to participate in the great counteroffensive; (3) Promote industrial production, prosper commerce and trade, and develop the four major specialties of the autonomous region: timber, salt, grain, livestock, and fur, to prosper the economy of the Inner Mongolia people. The lives of workers and other working people and staff must be improved; (4) Implement unified finance and economics, and organize large-scale military, government, and civilian production to support the war; (5) Actively join the army and participate in war service; (6) Continue to cultivate a large number of worker-peasant-herdsman and intellectual youth cadres, vigorously promote new worker-peasant-herdsman cadres and cadres who have indeed undergone transformation and testing; (7) Improve and develop the cultural education of farmers and herdsmen after they have turned over; (8) Unify strength, unify pace, and oppose the practice of acting independently, disregarding the overall situation.

According to statistics from the Jiang bandit provincial government: 215 privately-owned factories have been approved to resume operations, and along with those in the process of registering, there are approximately 400 (about one-fifth of the pre-war number). By July of last year, fewer than 100 could barely maintain operations, less than 5% of the pre-war number of factories, and most of them were on the verge of collapse. Of the province's five major private industries—textiles, rubber, cigarettes, matches, and sugar manufacturing—there were nearly a thousand factories of all sizes after the Japanese surrender. Currently, only 86 (including some unregistered small factories, same below) are still struggling to ship goods regularly, less than one-tenth of the original number. Other more important industries such as rice milling, oil refining, brewing, and chemical manufacturing, have fewer than five surviving enterprises in each category, and most are operating at a loss. The most important reason for the crisis in Guangdong's private industry is the dumping of American goods. The province is adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau, making it one of the major concentration areas for smuggling by the Four Big Families, thus inflicting deep damage on the province's private industry. In other news: Qingdao Xinhua and four other match factories announced their closure in the middle of last month due to their inability to sustain operations. The thirteen factories of the bureaucratic capital's China Textile Corporation in Qingdao also simultaneously ceased operations. The 20,000 workers in these thirteen factories have fallen into dire unemployment, affecting as many as 100,000 family members.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 广东美货倾销　害得民营工业垮台\n\n1948-01-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　广东美货倾销\n  　害得民营工业垮台\n    【新华社陕北十三日电】蒋区报纸披露：广东民族工业危机空前严重。据该省蒋匪省府统计：民营工厂经核准复业者有二百十五家，连同在登记中者约有四百家左右（此数约为战前的五分之一），至去年七月间能勉强维持营业者已不足百家，不及战前工厂数百分之五，且其中大部均已临倒闭危机。该省纺织、橡胶、卷烟、火柴、制糖五大民营工业，日本投降后共有大小工厂近千家，目前仍能勉强挣扎经常出货者仅有八十六家（包括一部分没有登记的小型工厂在内，以下同），不及原数十分之一。其他较重要工业如碾米、炼油、酿造、化学制造等，每种工业残存者均不足五家，且多亏损。造成广东民营工业危机的最重要原因，是美货倾销，该省毗连港澳，为四大家族走私的大集中地之一，因而给予该省民营工业深重打击。另息：青岛新华等五家火柴厂因无法维持，于上月中宣告歇业。官僚资本之中纺公司在青岛的十三个工厂亦于同时全部停工。该十三工厂两万工人陷于失业惨境，被牵连工人眷属达十万人之多。"

    "content": "【This Newspaper News】The Land Law promulgated by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party means to mobilize poor and hired peasants to unite with middle peasants, confiscate and distribute the land and all property of landlords, and extract the surplus from rich peasants for thorough and equal distribution. This matter is beneficial to all peasants. However, landlords, rich peasants, and some bad elements have come out to make trouble, deliberately spreading rumors and instigating lavish eating and drinking:\n　　Yan Zhushan, a landlord in Dagang Village, Seventh District of She County, and his two brothers, upon seeing the Land Law, thought that they would be given a share and could avoid struggle. They then cut down production trees (including one persimmon tree, one timber tree, five Chinese prickly ash trees, and five pepper trees) that the masses had left for their livelihood. The masses discovered this and immediately confiscated the trees they had cut down, and said to him: \"The knife handle of the Land Law is in our hands, it has nothing to do with you.\" This approach is very correct. If they were allowed to develop, the problem would become serious. In Tian Er Zhuang, Wu'an, they did not quickly recognize this conspiracy. When they discovered the rumor saying: \"Everything will be equally divided, even foot bindings will be divided,\" and did not immediately trace the source and stop it, the middle peasants were affected and killed five sheep during the Gregorian New Year and ate and drank lavishly by making dumplings. Later, after explaining the outline of the Land Law, saying that the movable property of middle peasants would not be touched, but that wealthy middle peasants would have to give up land, and some middle peasants would get land, the mood began to stabilize.\n　　The village chief of Sanwang Village in Wu'an, while eating and drinking lavishly himself, also said: \"Now it is equalizing land, and in the future, houses, farm tools, and livestock will slowly have to be equalized, and we will implement communism by eating from a big pot.\" He also said: \"It is good to eat from a big pot, it is difficult to manage a small family, it is better to be together so that everyone is not restrained.\" This kind of thinking reveals resistance to equal distribution. He deliberately distorts the Land Law to say that it is eating from a big pot. Saying this, the middle peasants and poor peasants will misunderstand; he can then exploit loopholes. Therefore, if we do not expose this kind of statement after hearing it, we will be fooled.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 挑动大吃大喝　就是破坏土地法\n\n1948-01-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　挑动大吃大喝\n  　就是破坏土地法\n    【本报消息】中国共产党中央公布的土地法，他的意思是发动贫雇农起来团结中农，没收分配地主的土地和一切财产，及抽出富农的多余部分，实行彻底平分，这件事情，对全体农民都有好处。地主富农及一些坏分子却出来捣乱，故意造谣生事，挑动大吃大喝：\n    涉县七区大港村地主阎祝山弟兄二人看到土地法，以为要分给他们一份，可以不斗了，便砍了群众留给他生活的生产树（计有柿树一棵，木料树一棵，楸树五棵，椒树五棵）。群众发现马上便把他砍的树没收了，并且对他说：“土地法刀把子在我们手里，与你无干。”这种做法很对，如果让他发展，问题就严重了。武安田二庄就因为没有很快警觉这种阴谋，当发现谣传说：“要大平分，裹脚布都要分。”没有立即追根制止，中农就受了影响，过阳历年杀了五个羊，包饺子大吃大喝起来。后来经过对土地法大纲的解释说中农的浮财不动，只是富裕中农要拿出土地，还有的中农要分得土地，情绪才开始安定下来。\n    武安三王村村长他一面自己大吃大喝，一面又说：“现在是均土地，往后就房子、农具、牲口慢慢啥也得均了，就实行共产起大锅。”还说：“起大锅也好，一个小家时光可作难咧，伙起来大家不受制。”这种想法说透了就是抵抗平分，他故意曲解土地法说是吃大锅，这样说的结果，中农、贫农都要起误会；他就可以钻空子了。所以听到这种说法后，咱们不揭发就要上当。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 15th: A serious phenomenon of landlords and rich peasants secretly slaughtering and abusing livestock has been discovered in various areas of this region. Li Zengliang, a rich peasant in Lijiawan, Xing County, deliberately damaged the hooves of an ox used for pulling coal and used this as an excuse to slaughter it. Yang Peiji and Yang Bingyin, landlords in Yangjiapo Village, and five or six other landlord families, did not properly feed their livestock, causing them to become thin and sick. Landlords in the village also burned large quantities of fodder as firewood, leaving peasants with no grass to feed their cattle after the distribution. The Jin-Sui Border Region Administrative Office and the Provisional Committee of the Farmers' Association have jointly issued a circular, calling on all peasants to be vigilant and defeat the landlords' plot to resist land reform and sabotage production. The circular stipulates that the slaughter and deliberate damaging of livestock is strictly prohibited. Violators will be charged with sabotage of production and handed over to the masses for handling or sent to the government for legal action. If livestock are indeed sick or disabled and cannot be treated, they must be inspected by the peasant representative council and approved by the government tax bureau before they can be slaughtered. In villages where land reform has not yet been carried out, the livestock of landlords and rich peasants should be immediately handed over to poor peasants who lack livestock for feeding and use, along with fodder, in preparation for formal distribution in the future. In villages where land reform is underway but not yet formally distributed, the livestock of landlords and rich peasants shall be managed by the peasant representative council, and the fodder of landlords and rich peasants shall also be managed by the Farmers' Association. In villages where land reform has already been carried out, peasants should also supervise each other and strictly prohibit the slaughter of livestock.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 15th: The Border Region Administrative Office recently publicly exposed in the Jin-Sui Daily that several departments and several leading comrades of this organization had made mistakes that resulted in the slaughter of oxen and harmed the interests of the working people due to impure thoughts and bureaucracy. In July of last year, the Administrative Office Tax Bureau discovered the phenomenon of selling and slaughtering cattle in Xing County, but did not pay serious attention to it. It only stipulated that anyone selling or slaughtering cattle must hold a certificate from the village farmers' association, believing that this would prevent the indiscriminate slaughter of cattle. However, from July to November of last year, the Xing County Tax Bureau approved the slaughter and sale of as many as 48 head of cattle (in previous years, only 10 head were approved annually), and beef on the market was much cheaper than pork and mutton. Wang Dingmin, head of the Tax Section of the Administrative Office and director of the Tax Bureau of the First District, not only failed to conduct an in-depth investigation of this phenomenon, but instead instructed his subordinates to buy cattle to improve their lives. As a result, three catering units of the Administrative Office competed to buy cattle for slaughter. Sun Jianfeng, the person in charge of the Secretariat, also believed that eating beef was good, \"It does not exceed the supply standard and can improve the food.\" At that time, iron needles, copper coins, and iron wires were peeled out of the stomachs of the cattle, but everyone was not alert or concerned about this, and only satisfied with eating beef. At the end of September, Comrade Wu Xinyu, Director of the Administrative Office, returned from outside and discovered the eating of beef. He immediately inquired and asked Sun Jianfeng to be alert to the landlords' and rich peasants' conspiracy to sabotage production, and ordered Chen Naijun, head of the Agriculture Section of the Construction Department, to immediately investigate the slaughter of cattle and draft a ban on the slaughter of cattle; however, Sun and Chen ignored this instruction and delayed it for two months under the pretext of insufficient investigation materials, while the phenomenon of slaughtering cattle within the organization continued to develop. By the end of last year, based on the materials of slaughtering cattle within the organization and in Xing County, it was discovered that this problem had developed to a serious extent. Director Wu immediately launched the entire organization to conduct an inspection as a specific content of the ongoing three-check study. He also urgently telegraphed to all counties to strictly prohibit the slaughter of livestock. Director Wu also conducted a strict self-criticism. In addition, it was decided by the Political Affairs Conference to give the following three people the following punishments: Sun Jianfeng was given a demerit, Chen Naijun was dismissed, and Wang Dingmin was given a warning.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋绥地主富农暗杀牲畜　行署农会下令禁止\n\n1948-01-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋绥地主富农暗杀牲畜\n  　行署农会下令禁止\n    【新华社晋绥十五日电】本区各地已发现地主富农暗地宰杀和虐害牲畜的严重现象。兴县李家湾富农李增良用耕牛拉炭，故意弄坏牛蹄，借此宰杀。该县杨家坡杨培基、杨秉寅等五六家地主，不好好喂养牲畜，使牲畜瘦病。该村地主并大量以饲草当柴烧，使农民分牛后无草可喂。晋绥边区行署及农会临时委员会顷特发表联合通令，号召全体农民警觉起来，击破地主阶级反抗土地改革破坏生产的毒计。通令并规定，严禁宰杀和故意弄坏牲畜，违者以破坏生产论罪，交群众处理或送政府法办。如确系有病或残废而又无法治疗之牲畜，须经农民代表会查验及政府税局批准，方可宰杀。尚未进行土地改革之村庄，地主富农之牲畜应立即交与缺乏牲畜之贫苦农民喂养使用，并附带草料，以备将来正式分配。凡尚未正式分配而正在进行土地改革之村庄，地主富农牲畜由农民代表会管制，地主富农之饲草亦应交由农会管制。凡已经土地改革之村庄，农民亦应相互监督，严禁宰杀牲畜。\n    【新华社晋绥十五日电】边区行政公署顷在晋绥日报公开揭发本机关几个部门和几位领导同志，由于思想不纯和官僚主义，造成宰杀耕牛，损害劳动人民利益的错误。去年七月，行署税务局发现兴县卖牛杀牛现象，但未予以严重注意，只规定凡卖牛宰牛者须持有本村农会证明信，认为这样就可防止乱杀耕牛。但从去年七月到十一月，兴县税局验准杀卖之耕牛达四十八头（往年全年仅验准十头），市场上牛肉比猪羊肉便宜很多。行署税务科长兼一分区税务局长王定民对此现象不仅未深入检查，反吩咐下级买牛改善生活。于是行署机关三个伙食单位竞相买牛宰杀。秘书室负责人孙剑峰也认为吃牛肉好，“不超过供给标准，又可改善伙食。”当时曾从牛胃中剥出铁针铜钱铁丝等物，大家对此也毫不警惕和过问，以吃牛肉为满足。九月底，行署主任武新宇同志自外归来，发现吃牛肉，立即查问，要孙剑峰警惕地主富农破坏生产的阴谋，并责成建设处农业科长陈乃君立即调查杀牛情况，草拟杀牛禁令；但孙、陈漠视此一指示，借口调查材料不够而拖延两月之久，本机关内部杀牛现象则继续发展。至去年年底，根据机关内部及兴县杀牛材料，发现这一问题已发展到严重程度，武主任立即发动整个机关进行检查，作为正在进行三查学习的具体内容之一。并已紧急电告各县，严禁宰杀牲畜。武主任亦进行了严格的自我批评。另经政务会议决定给予下列三人以处分：孙剑峰记过、陈乃君撤职、王定民警告。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. According to combined news reports from the Chiang-controlled areas: People's armed forces of varying sizes are densely distributed throughout the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the heartland of Chiang Kai-shek's rule, and have established multiple base areas. The main People's armed forces in Jiangsu are primarily composed of veterans of the New Fourth Army. In 1946, led by Yang Bin, Wu Xian, Li Shunzhi, and others, they began armed resistance against Chiang Kai-shek's persecution. At that time, there was already one detachment and another unit of several hundred people. Later, farmers joined in large numbers, with over a thousand people in Yixing alone. Currently, People's armed forces are active in the Maoshan area, including Jurong, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Jintan, Liyang, Jiangyin, Chongming, Fengxian, Chuansha, and other places, as well as the Taihu Pingtaishan area, and have successively established democratic regimes in various locations. After the People's Liberation Army launched a large-scale counter-offensive southward last year, the various People's armed forces became even more active in launching attacks, posing a great threat to Chiang Kai-shek, forcing him to arm the railway lines of Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) and Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou). Chiang Kai-shek even issued an order on the 6th of this month to \"strengthen the operation against the CCP guerrillas in the Jinghu area.\" The Chiang Kai-shek Jinghu River Defense Command also held a meeting on the 10th (according to a Shanghai dispatch from the Associated Press), which shows the growing prestige of the People's armed forces in Jiangnan.\n\nZhejiang has five important base areas: (1) The Siming Mountains in eastern Zhejiang, including Ningbo, Cixi, Yuyao, Shangyu, Shengxian, Xinchang, and Chiang Kai-shek's hometown of Fenghua, etc. The main part is the Li Zhiguang unit in this mountain area, with one thousand several hundred people. Now the team is gradually expanding and has established a command headquarters and the Eastern Zhejiang Administrative Office. Another is the Sanbei area, located in the salt-producing area north of Ningbo, Cixi, and Yuyao, with five or six hundred people. The Xu Xiaoyu unit owns more than a hundred small boats, revolving in the land and water areas of Dinghai, Zhenhai, Ninghai, Xiangshan, Nantian and other counties. (2) The Kuaiji Mountains, the Zhou Zhishan unit of more than a thousand people, extending across Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Zhuji and other counties. (3) Southwest of the Kuaiji area is the Ding Guzhi and Wu Shanmin units of the Jin (Hua) Lan (Xi) Basin, with about a thousand people, active in Pujiang, Yiwu, Jiande, Dongyang and other counties. (4) To its southeast are the Kuocang Mountains and Yandang Mountains, including Yongkang, Xianju, Linhai, Huangyan, Wenling, Yueqing, Qingtian, Lishui, Jinyun, Wenzhou, Ruian, Pingyang, Taishun, west along the Fengling Mountains directly to Qingyuan, Longquan, Jiangshan, Changshan, south along the coast to the Fujian border, Fuding, Xiapu and other counties. In 1946, there were already several thousand people led by Cheng Meixing, Huang Longyao, Jin Jinbiao and others under the leadership of the \"Fujian-Zhejiang Border Region Headquarters,\" combined with the local farmers' armed forces \"Big Swords Society,\" taking the area around Fenshuiguan and Qingcao Pass as their base area, developing in all directions. Now the above-mentioned active areas have established the \"Zhejiang-Fujian Border Region\" base area, and the more prominent leaders among them are Zheng Danfu. (5) The Tianmu Mountain area on the border of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. In 1946, there were already over a thousand people from the Wang Shoupeng and Tang Songlin units active. Now, two major guerrilla forces have been established. One part gallops in Anji, Changxing, Wuxing, Deqing, Tongxiang, Lin'an, Yuqian, Changhua and other counties, separated from the Kuaiji Mountains only by the Qiantang River; the other part is the Ning (Guo) Guang (De) (the above two counties are in Anhui) Xiao (Feng) Guerrilla Independent Detachment led by Xu Xiaozhen. The above-mentioned troops are all composed of veterans of the New Fourth Army as their backbone.\n\nThe main base area in Anhui is the Huangshan area. In 1946, there were two People's armed forces composed of veterans of the New Fourth Army active: one led by Hu Ming, with over a thousand people and guns, and the other was the Huangshan Detachment led by Feng Lin. After more than a year of development, its military prestige has spread almost throughout southern Anhui. Shexian, Xiuning, Yixian, Qimen, Jixi, Jingde, Ningguo, Xuanzhou, Wuhu along the Jinggan Road, and Taiping, Shitai, Qingyang, Guichi along the Shexian-Tong'anqing Highway, and Jingxian, Nanling, and Fanchang counties between the two roads are all guerrilla areas. In 1947, they successively attacked Jixi and Jingxian.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 江南人民武装活跃　到处建立根据地　威胁蒋匪心腹区\n\n1948-01-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　江南人民武装活跃\n  　到处建立根据地\n  　威胁蒋匪心腹区\n    【新华社陕北十二日电】综合蒋区报刊消息：蒋匪统治心脏苏浙皖三省密布大小不等之人民武装，并已建立根据地多处。江苏之主要人民武装多以新四军退伍军人为骨干，他们为反抗蒋匪迫害，于一九四六年由杨彬、吴显、李顺之等率领，实行武装抗蒋。当时即有一个支队及另部数百人。以后农民纷纷参加，仅宜兴一地即有千余人。现茅山地区句容、镇江、丹阳、金坛、溧阳、江阴、崇明、奉贤、川沙等地及太湖平台山一带湖面，均有人民武装活动，并已先后在各地建立民主政权。去年人民解放军大举南下反攻之后，各部人民武装更积极出击，予蒋匪极大威胁，迫使其在京沪、沪杭各线武装护路。蒋贼且于本月六日下令“加强对京沪区中共游击队的作战”，蒋匪京沪江防司令部也于十日召开会议（据合众社上海电），足见江南人民武装声威日大。\n    浙江重要根据地有五：（一）浙东四明山区，包括宁波、慈溪、余姚、上虞、县、新昌及蒋贼家乡奉化等县，主要一部为该山区李之光部一千数百人，现队伍日渐扩大，已设司令部及浙东行政公署。另为三北区，地处宁波、慈溪、余姚以北的产盐区，有五六百人。徐小玉部则拥小艇百余，回旋于定海、镇海、宁海、象山、南田等县水陆地区。（二）会稽山区周芝山部千余人，纵横于绍兴、萧山、诸暨等县。（三）在会稽地区之西南为金（华）兰（溪）盆地之丁谷之、吴山民等部约千人，活动于浦江、义乌、建德、东阳等县。（四）其东南为括苍山与雁荡山区，包括永康、仙居、临海、黄岩、温岭、乐清、青田、丽水、缙云、温州、瑞安、平阳、泰顺，西沿枫岭山脉直达庆元、龙泉、江山、常山，南傍海岸以迄闽境福鼎、霞浦等县，于四六年即有“闽浙边区总部”领导下之程美兴、黄龙耀、金锦标等率领之数千人，结合当地农民武装“大刀会”以分水关、青草隘一带为根据地，四出发展，现上列活动地区，已建立“浙闽边区”根据地，其中领袖之较著者为郑丹甫。（五）苏浙皖边境天目山区，四六年即有汪寿彭、汤松林部千余人活动，现已建立两大游击部队，一部驰骋于安吉、长兴、吴兴、德清、桐乡、临安、于潜、昌化等县，与会稽山区仅钱塘江一水之隔；另部为许孝珍率领之宁（国）广（德）（上两县在皖境）孝（丰）游击独立支队。上列部队均系以新四军退伍军人为骨干所组成。\n    安徽之主要根据地为黄山区，四六年即有新四军退伍军人组成之人民武装两部活动：一为胡明率领，人枪千余，另为冯林领导之黄山支队。经年余发展，军威几遍皖南全境，沿京赣路之歙县、休宁、黟县、祁门、绩溪、旌德、宁国、宣城、芜湖、及歙县通安庆公路沿线之太平、石埭、青阳、贵池与两路之间的泾县、南陵、繁昌等县均为游击区。四七年曾先后攻入绩溪、泾县。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 13th: Farmers in the Chiang Kai-shek-occupied areas of Shaanxi are in an extremely miserable situation under the cruel exploitation of the Chiang-Hu bandit gang. The Shaanxi provincial Chiang bandits' collection of land tax and public grain is calculated based on the \"land grain silver\" announced on July 1st, with each yuan equivalent to 19 catties and 14 taels of grain, which increased to 39 catties and 12 taels per yuan in October. Now it has increased from 1.84 dou per yuan (30 catties per dou) to 3.44 dou. Jingyang County has already levied additional grain taxes twice, and the third time is about to begin. The Chiang-Hu bandit gang's exorbitant taxes and levies are even more numerous, such as \"village chief's meeting fee in the county,\" \"self-defense army's inspection fee in the county,\" \"telephone pole fee,\" \"road repair fee,\" \"township head's guest reception fee,\" \"committee member's visit reception fee,\" \"township representative's reception fee,\" \"garrison troop's coal transportation fee,\" and so on. In Changsun Township, Sanyuan County, the payment slips posted on the walls of each household in Qujia Slope and Quzi villages were enough to reach three zhang in length in just eight months last year, and each slip was written with three or four types of apportionments. In addition, there were extortions such as a fine of 60,000 yuan for unclear household registration, a fine of 5,000 yuan for walking without a road permit (the fine before February last year, which has now increased), and a punishment of up to six months of \"imprisonment\" for failing to report guests, or cash substitutes, etc. Local tyrants, secret agents, and village heads all shift all burdens onto the poor. Liu Lutang (a secretary with a simplified appointment in Chiang Kai-shek's Supervisory Yuan), a landlord in Changfang Village, Erbao Township, Xianqian Township, Sanyuan County, owns more than 600 mu of land, but his burden is the same as a poor farmer in the village who cultivates six mu of land. In addition, they exploit the people through usury and commercial speculation. Zhao Fen, a large landlord in Xianyang County (his brother Zhao Ting is a pro-Chiang Kai-shek Shaanxi provincial appointed senator), owns more than 10 qing of land and lends more than 3,000 shi of grain at high interest. Yang Jiahui, a speculative merchant and pseudo-senator in Gaoling County, lends 6,000 shi of grain. When the Chiang Kai-shek government urgently presses for grain and payments, the bureaucratic landlords and merchants manipulate the market, and the price of cotton suddenly plummets after the autumn harvest, while the price of wheat rises sharply. Under such brutal plunder by the Chiang-Hu bandit gang, many farmers are ruined and die. In the vast rural areas of Jingyang, Sanyuan, Yaoxian, and Chang'an counties, in order to resist this bone-sucking extortion by the Chiang-Hu bandit gang, children are now taking turns to watch in front of and behind the villages. When they see a team carrying guns to demand payment, they shout \"They're coming!\", and all the people in the village flee to the wilderness. However, the Chiang-Hu bandit gang's \"payment collection team\" takes the opportunity to ransack everywhere and rob at will.\n\nAnother report: The various large and small people's armed forces in southern Shaanxi number about 5,000 to 6,000 people. The most important of these is a part of the \"Shangluo Guerrilla Headquarters,\" with more than 4,700 people and guns, led by Gong Defang and Wang Lie as commander and deputy commander respectively.

The spokesperson of the CPC Central Committee extends thanks to the Canadian Seamen's Union and the Singapore Federation of Trade Unions for their lofty international friendship towards the Chinese people. These two trade unions are currently resisting the Canadian reactionary government's transportation of weapons and military equipment to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The spokesperson of the CPC Central Committee stated: The Canadian reactionary government, following in the footsteps of American imperialists, has provided the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang with a loan of 60 million US dollars and 150 Mosquito bombers to help it carry out the civil war to slaughter the Chinese people, which has aroused great anger among the Chinese people. The Canadian reactionary government's so-called \"loan\" of 60 million US dollars is actually a synonym for munitions, and all its assistance to the Chiang bandits is actually military assistance. The sinister and brutal conspiracies of the imperialists, and the ferocious faces hidden behind the so-called \"democracy\" mask, are now completely exposed, and are being righteously opposed by workers in Canada and Singapore. The Chinese people express their heartfelt gratitude to the Canadian Seamen's Union and the Singapore Federation of Trade Unions for their assistance to the Chinese people. This lofty spirit of international solidarity demonstrated by Canadian and Singaporean workers has greatly increased the courage of the Chinese people to fight for liberation, and believes that the people of the world will surely win in the struggle against imperialism and for people's democracy, because the spirit of close unity among the people of all countries is a great and unparalleled force, and in the face of this force, the enemies of the people will ultimately fail.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中共中央发言人发表谈话  反对加拿大反动政府军事援蒋　向加拿大新加坡工人义举致谢\n\n1948-01-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中共中央发言人发表谈话\n    反对加拿大反动政府军事援蒋\n  　向加拿大新加坡工人义举致谢\n    【新华社陕北十五日电】中共中央发言人对加拿大海员工会与新加坡工会联合会向中国人民所表示的崇高的国际友谊致谢。该两工会现正在抵制加拿大反动政府运送武器及兵工器材给蒋介石匪帮。中共中央发言人称：加拿大反动政府追随美国帝国主义者之后，给蒋介石匪帮以六千万美元的借款和蚊式轰炸机一百五十架，帮助其进行屠杀中国人民的内战，已引起中国人民的很大愤怒。加拿大反动政府的六千万美元的所谓“借款”原来就是军火的代名词，其给与蒋匪的全部援助，原来都是军事援助。帝国主义者的不可告人的残暴阴谋，所谓“民主主义”面具后面掩盖着的狰狞面目，现在是揭穿无遗，而且遭受到加拿大与新加坡工人的正义的反对了。加拿大海员工会与新加坡工会联合会对于中国人民的援助，中国人民表示衷心的感谢。加拿大海员工人与新加坡工人所表现的这种崇高的国际团结的精神，大大增高了中国人民为解放而斗争的勇气，并且相信全世界人民在反对帝国主义及争取人民民主的斗争中必能胜利，因为各国人民亲密团结的精神乃是伟大无比的力量，在这个力量的面前，人民的敌人必将最后失败。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 13th: Comrade Li Zhuoran, Propaganda Minister of the Northwest Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, made a self-criticism on propaganda work at the Border Region Land Conference, saying: In the war to defend the Border Region, the Party's propaganda work was exposed as the weakest link in all wartime work. The basic error was that the work was divorced from the masses, divorced from reality, and lacked a clear class viewpoint. In terms of cadre education, the leadership did not criticize and struggle against the ideological shortcomings or serious errors of cadres in the land reform and the war, or the criticism was not thorough enough. The issues revealed at this conference, such as sheltering landlords and rich peasants, failing to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, bureaucracy, warlordism, and petty-bourgeois individualism, etc., were due to the leadership's past bureaucracy, which failed to discover them, or failed to insist on criticizing them thoroughly, and failed to use the typical examples as teaching materials to draw the attention of the entire Party. I deeply feel that I have failed in my duty. This liberal attitude is also one of the reasons why cadre education is divorced from reality. As for studying and summarizing practical experience as educational material, it is a good way to eliminate blindness, and it is also education on specific policies. In the past, our achievements in this area were too poor, which is a manifestation of theoretical work lagging behind practical movements. We must overcome this, and I must also bear the main responsibility for this. Regarding the education of rural Party members, it can only take effect when combined with the actual movements of rural struggles. Education should be carried out in the struggle against the enemy, against landlords and despots, and against cadres who use coercion and commandism and embezzle the fruits of land reform; in production organizations, stretcher transport teams, and various meetings; and when distributing land, distributing floating wealth, determining class status, and accepting or expelling Communist Party members. These are all the most practical education, and as long as there is leadership, Party members can educate themselves. However, some Party member cadres go to the countryside only to arrange work as usual, never look for branches, never look for Party members, and do not do any work to educate Party members. This is an unforgivable mistake. After reviewing the above errors, Comrade Zhuoran analyzed the origins, saying: The current propaganda department's ranks are very impure, with very few poor and lower-middle peasant components, lacking mass feelings, and even completely looking down on the masses. In terms of leadership, there is a lack of mass viewpoints in thinking, a lack of specificity and seriousness in work, and the resulting bureaucracy and liberalism. Without removing these two things, the work cannot be done well. After this meeting, I am determined to remove these two bad things from myself and hope everyone will supervise and help.\n\nRegarding future work, Comrade Zhuoran proposed that the \"Double Ten Declaration\" of the Chinese People's Liberation Army must be deeply disseminated to the broad masses, calling on them to strive to realize the various policies in the declaration. The current cultural and educational ranks in the Border Region must be rectified according to the spirit of the Land Conference, and a large number of cultural and educational workers must be organized to learn and train in the land reform. Schools should absorb a large number of workers and peasants. Newspapers should strengthen close ties with the masses, so that they can truly become the Party's weapons for guiding work in the war and land reform, and the struggle against \"empty talk\" must continue. Finally, Comrade Zhuoran emphasized that all Party propaganda work must be closely combined with the masses and reality. Every Party member propaganda worker must constantly review and train themselves to become a fighter who wholeheartedly serves the people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 党的一切宣传工作　必须提高阶级性　西北局李卓然同志检讨\n\n1948-01-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　党的一切宣传工作\n  　必须提高阶级性\n  　西北局李卓然同志检讨\n    【新华社西北十三日电】中共西北局宣传部长李卓然同志在边区土地会议上检讨宣教工作说：在保卫边区的战争中，暴露了党的宣传工作是战时各种工作中最薄弱的一环，其基本错误，是在工作中脱离群众、脱离实际、缺乏明确的阶级观点。在干部教育方面，领导上对于土地改革和战争中干部思想上的缺点或严重错误，没有进行批评与斗争，或进行得很不彻底。这次大会揭露的，如包庇地主富农、敌我不分、官僚主义、军阀主义，以及小资产阶级的个人主义等等，就是由于过去领导上官僚主义，没有发现，或没有坚持批评到底，没有把其中的典型例子作为教材，提起全党的注意，我深感自己失职。这种自由主义的态度，也就是使干部教育脱离实际的原因之一。至于研究与总结实际经验作为教育材料，是去掉盲目性的好办法，也就是具体政策的教育，过去我们在这方面的成绩太差，也就是理论工作落后于实际运动的表现，必须克服，这点我也要负主要责任。关于农村党员教育，只有与农村具体斗争实际运动相结合才能生效，要在对敌斗争，向地主恶霸斗争，向强迫命令与贪污土地改革果实的干部斗争时去教育，要在生产组织中、担架运输队中和各种会议中去教育，要在分土地、分浮财、定成份、接收或开除共产党员时去教育，这些都是最实际的教育，只要有人领导，党员自己就可以教育自己。但有些党员干部下乡只是照例布置工作，从来不找支部，不找党员，不做任何教育党员的工作，这是犯了不可容许的错误。关于群众教育，日本投降以后，对外的民族斗争变为国内阶级斗争，但是关于打倒蒋介石消灭地主阶级的宣传，在群众中却做得很差。“全党要作宣传工作”，远在一九三九年边区党二次代表大会上就提出了，但直至今日尚未贯彻。卓然同志于检讨上述错误后，分析与产生根源说：目前宣教部门的队伍很不纯洁，贫雇农成份很少，缺乏群众情感，甚至完全看不起群众。在领导上，则是思想上缺乏群众观点，工作中缺乏具体性与严肃性，及由此而产生的官僚主义与自由主义毛病。不去掉这两个东西，工作便无法做好。这次会议后，我决心把自己身上这两件坏东西去掉，希望大家监督帮助。\n    关于今后工作，卓然同志提出必须把中国人民解放军的双十宣言深入传达到广大群众中去，号召他们为实现宣言中的各项政策而奋斗。对目前边区的文教队伍，必须根据土地会议精神加以整顿，并组织大批文教工作者到土地改革中去学习与锻炼。学校应大量吸收工农分子入学。报纸应加强与群众的密切联系，使它真能成为党在战争与土地改革中指导工作的武器，要继续开展反“客里空”斗争。最后卓然同志强调指出党的一切宣传工作，必须密切与群众和实际相结合，每个党员宣传工作者必须经常检讨与锻炼自己，成为全心全意为人民服务的战斗员。"

When French Communist Party Secretary Duclos addressed the demonstrators, he called on them to oppose the Marshall Plan and the Mayer Plan (i.e., the new tax law). Representatives of aircraft industry workers in the Paris region also held a meeting on the 9th to protest the Schuman government's work slowdown in the nationalized aircraft industry under the instruction of the United States. It is said that in the past four months, the aircraft industry has not received a single order, and the government's debt of 9 billion francs has not been paid at all. The textile industry in important industrial areas of northern France, such as Lille, Roubaix, and Tourcoing, is facing the danger of closing down due to American obstruction and the arson by thugs of De Gaulle's \"Union\" in various places to destroy stored cotton. Therefore, 200,000 local textile workers are preparing for a new struggle to oppose the Franco-American reactionaries' conspiracy to destroy French industry.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 反对舒曼卖国政策　法农民开代表会议\n\n1948-01-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　反对舒曼卖国政策\n  　法农民开代表会议\n    【新华社陕北十六日电】巴黎讯：法国人民反对舒曼卖国政策吸马歇尔奴役法国计划的斗争，正积极进行中。据塔斯社十四日电：由于法共五个省组织的发起，巴黎曾召集农民代表会议。会议上农民代表们纷纷抨击二日签订的“法美双边协定”，反对舒曼卖国政策与加重捐税。在闭幕词中法共领袖之一马尔梯指出：舒曼今日打击农民，正如它昨日打击工人阶级一样。马尔梯着重称：舒曼的政策，就是逢迎美国资本家、毁灭法国农业，并绞杀法国工业。同样性质的会议及示威亦在其他城市中进行。塔斯社十二日电称：里昂曾举行退伍军人大示威。法共书记杜克洛向示威者演说时，号召示威者反对马歇尔计划及迈耶计划（即新税收法）。巴黎区飞机工业工人代表于九日亦召开会议，抗议舒曼政府在美国授意下，对国有化的飞机工业怠工。据称：在过去四个月内，飞机工业没有得到一张订单，而政府所欠的九十亿法郎也未付分文。法国北部重要工业区如里尔、鲁贝和都尔科音的纺织工业，由于美国的阻碍及戴高乐“联盟”的流氓在各地放火烧毁存棉的结果，正面临关厂的危险，因此当地廿万纺织工人正准备新的斗争，以反对法美反动派毁灭法国工业的阴谋。"

    "content": "Taihang Second Military Sub-district New Recruit Training\n\tGreat Results from Using Poor and Hired Peasants as Backbone\n\n[Taihang News] Summary report on the political education of new recruits in the Second Regiment of the Taihang Second Military Sub-district: During the regiment's one-and-a-half-month training period, the entire regiment spent half a month conducting the \"Three Checks\" (checking class origin, checking work attitude, and checking combat will). Another five days were spent studying the People's Liberation Army Declaration. Political training focused on in-depth land reform and class education, with poor and hired peasants as the backbone, resulting in significant effectiveness. Firstly, upon gathering the new recruits, a comprehensive education was conducted for all soldiers regarding current affairs, enabling everyone to understand the scale of our victory today and establish faith in a bright future. At the general assembly of the entire regiment, some poor and hired soldiers made accusations, narrating their own histories of blood, sweat, and tears, and exposing the exploiting crimes of the landlord class, so that everyone was aware from the beginning that they were taking up arms to completely turn themselves over and defend their liberation; at the same time, everyone clarified the nature of the People's Liberation Army today, and established the concept of liberating the laboring brothers. From this, a movement to examine the motives for joining the army was launched, and everyone conducted reviews, returning those who were unqualified. After everyone had initially corrected their attitude towards the Liberation Army, they universally started with poor and hired peasants leading the way in speaking out about their suffering, from discussing suffering within the squad (group) to organizing the entire company to speak out about suffering. For example, after several typical accusations of suffering by the Twelfth Company, everyone's class emotions were stirred. When Ge Suxi recounted how his family was exploited by landlords, starved to death, five members in a row, with no land to bury them, and how he threw his sister in the wilderness, letting wolves bite her, the whole audience shed tears. Finally, he said with grief and indignation: \"I am the only one left. I escaped and lived through blizzards barefoot. Now I want to avenge my brothers and sisters!\" After this meeting, the soldiers who wanted to go home also turned to complaining about their suffering, and the comrades who superficially complained about suffering also turned to deep thinking and detailed discussions, and the learning situation was opened up from then on. The activists who emerged during the movement quickly formed poor and hired peasant groups to lead everyone in learning, and enabled the middle peasants to achieve solid unity. In this way, the movement quickly pushed towards a climax on a clear class line, and then ideological alignment was carried out. Those with good understanding and high consciousness were selected by everyone, and the previous squad and platoon cadres designated from above were replaced with new, active poor and hired peasants after democratic evaluation. In the final stage, during the People's Liberation Army education, everyone clarified from the contrast between the poor and rich in the old society who created the land and how the landlords took away their land. Everyone quickly recognized from defending the land that the essence of today's war is: \"Chiang Kai-shek is fighting the civil war to protect the landlords and take away our land; we are fighting Chiang Kai-shek to defend our land and return home.\" Therefore, Zhang Laiyu of the Eleventh Company of the Third Battalion said during the study: \"If you want to turn over completely, you must practice good skills to dig up Chiang's roots. If you want to dig up Chiang's roots, you must attack Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive.\" The awareness of the entire regiment of armed struggle and people's war has also been greatly improved. The entire regiment is now moving towards further training.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行二分区新兵整训　贫雇作骨干收效大\n\n1948-01-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行二分区新兵整训\n  　贫雇作骨干收效大\n    【太行消息】太行二分区补充第二团新兵政治教育总结报告：该团在一个半月的整训期中，全团用了半个月时间进行三查，另以五天学习人民解放军宣言，政治训练是以深入土改的阶级教育为基本内容，以贫雇战士为骨干，因而收效很大。首先在新兵集中后，便以当前时事向所有战士进行全面的教育，使大家了解今天我们胜利的规模，确立光明前途的信念。在全团成立大会上，有的贫雇战士进行了控诉，叙述自己流血、流汗、流泪的历史，揭露地主阶级的剥削罪恶，使大家在思想上，一开始就意识到自己是为了彻底翻身和保卫翻身而来掌握武装的；同时也使大家明确今天人民解放军的性质，树立解放劳苦兄弟的观念。从这当中，便展开了检查入伍动机运动，大家进行审查，将不合格的退回。在大家初步端正了对解放军的态度后，就普遍的以贫雇带头进行诉苦，由班内（小组）谈苦到组织全连诉苦，如十二连经过几个典型诉苦，便调动了大家的阶级情绪。当葛苏喜诉到他家被地主剥削一连饿死五口人，家没了地土、无处可埋，将自己姐姐扔在野地，让狼咬了时，全场都落了泪。最后他悲愤的说：“剩下我一个人，冒着雪赤着脚逃难过活，活到现在，我要为我的兄弟姐姐来报仇”！经过这个大会，有想家的战士也转向了诉苦，浮皮诉苦的同志也走向了深思细谈，学习局面从此打开。在运动中涌出的积极分子便很快组成了贫雇小组，领导大家进行学习，并使中贫农达到了巩固的团结。这样便使运动在明确的阶级路线上很快的推向了高潮，随即就进行了思想站队，认识好、觉悟高的被大家选了出来，把以前由上而下指定的班排干部，经过民主评定，换上了新的积极贫雇。最后一段，在进行解放军教育中，大家从旧社会的穷富对比中，明确了谁创造土地，地主如何夺去自己土地后，大家很快便从保卫土地上又进一步认识了今天战争的本质：“蒋介石打内战是为了保护地主夺去我们的土地，我们打蒋介石是为了保卫自己的土地还家。”因而，三营十一连的张来玉在学习中就说：“要想大翻身必须练好本领刨蒋根，要想刨蒋根，就要打到南京城，活捉蒋介石。”全团战士对武装对人民战争的自觉性也大为提高。现全团已走向进一步的整训。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Rome dispatch: The Italian working people are launching a more heroic struggle, and have achieved complete victory in some places. According to a TASS report on the 10th: Several thousand working people in Rome held a meeting to protest the closure of two steel factories in Rome and the illegal actions of the police in using tear gas to force workers to leave the factories. \"Unità\" pointed out: The closure of factories is a new offensive by the reactionary industrialists' association against the working class in Rome. To prevent the closure of other factories, workers at the Mannorini and Di Vianno factories went on strike and occupied the factories. The Gasperi government, intimidated by the power of the workers, was forced to fully accept the workers' demands, namely that wages be paid as usual during the workers' strike, and that the factory committee must be consulted before any worker is dismissed in the future. Factories that have already been closed will be reopened. Workers in the city of Pistoia (northern Italy) held a general strike and demonstration in support of textile, glass, and lead factory workers in the city who were protesting the factory owners' reduction of production. They also erected obstacles in the streets to prevent and resist police suppression. As a result, the workers also achieved complete victory, all demands were accepted, and the arrested workers were released. At the same time, 100,000 lire in compensation was obtained for workers injured by the blockade of the highway near Boniro. Strike struggles are still expanding in other parts of Italy. The Italian General Confederation of Labor (CGIL) called on 160,000 tax employees to strike on the 13th to support the 100,000 bank employees' general strike, which has lasted for 14 days. The fourth negotiation between the reactionary government and representatives of bank employees broke down because the reactionary government refused to make concessions. This strike \"has become a new high tide in the nationwide labor movement, threatening the Italian economy\" (Associated Press), paralyzing national finance and various business transactions. According to informal estimates by the Bankers Association, approximately 60 billion lire (US$102 million) worth of business is at a standstill. 1,600 dockworkers in Ancona (on the Adriatic Sea) occupied the shipyard because the capitalists refused to pay wages under the pretext of a lack of funds. Engineers, administrators, and workers jointly maintained operations, and order was good. Workers at the Monti factory in Civitavecchia (in the coastal province of Rome) went on a sit-down strike to protest wage cuts. The demonstrations by local garrisons in several major cities against the postponement of demobilization for soldiers of the 1925 class have been supported by the Italian Communist Party (PCI). The Sixth Congress of the PCI passed a resolution demanding the immediate demobilization of soldiers of the 1925 class. \"Unità\" revealed: \"The parties currently in power in Italy are attempting to challenge the people on the eve of the election.\" The newspaper stressed: \"Obviously, the police and the American army cannot achieve the goal of suppressing the people.\"\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Rome dispatch: The strike wave in Italy continues to rise. At the call of the Italian General Confederation of Labor (CGIL), 160,000 employees of national tax authorities declared a general strike on the morning of the 12th to support the bank employees' strike. The CGIL secretariat held a meeting on the 13th to pay tribute to the 100,000 bank employees who had been fighting valiantly and continuously across the country for two weeks. The secretariat also reiterated its support for the bank employees' struggle. The strike wave has also spread to Naples, where 2,600 miners went on strike to demand improved working conditions and occupied several coal mines.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 意国工人英勇罢工　若干地方已获胜利\n\n1948-01-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　意国工人英勇罢工\n  　若干地方已获胜利\n    【新华社陕北十四日电】罗马讯：意大利劳动人民正展开更英勇的斗争，若干地方并已取得全部胜利。据塔斯社十日报导：罗马数千劳动人民曾举行大会，抗议罗马两个钢铁工厂关门、以及警察为了迫使工人离厂而施用催泪弹的非法行为。团结报指出：闭厂是反动的工业家联合会反对罗马工人阶级的新攻势。为了预防其他工厂的关门，曼诺里尼及狄维安诺诸厂工人举行罢工，并占领了工厂。加斯贝利政府慑于工人的声威，被迫完全接受工人的要求，即工人罢工期间工资照付，今后开除工人，必须经过工厂小组委员会的讨论。业已关门的工厂仍将开工。彼斯托亚（意北）城工人因声援该城纺织、玻璃和制铅工厂抗议厂主减低生产，曾举行总罢工及示威，并在街上堆起障碍物阻止并抵抗警察的镇压。结果，工人也获得全胜，一切要求已被接受，被捕工人已释放。同时对封锁波尼罗附近公路因而受伤的工人，已取得十万里拉的赔偿金。在意大利其它地方的罢工斗争，仍在扩大。意总工会号召十六万税务员工于十三日罢工，以支援已坚持十四天的十万银行雇员大罢工。反动政府与银行职工代表的第四次谈判，均因反动政府的拒绝让步而告破裂，这一罢工“成为波及全国的劳工运动新高潮，威胁着意大利经济”（美联社），使全国金融及各业交易陷入瘫痪状态。据银行业协会非正式的估计，约有价值六百亿里拉（一亿零二百万美元）的营业，陷于停顿中。安康纳（滨亚得里亚海）码头工人一千六百人，因资方借口缺款拒付工资而将船坞占领，工程师、管理员和工人共同维持工作，秩序良好。塞维塔维加（属罗马省滨海）孟蒂工厂工人因抗议降低工资而进行静坐罢工。为反对一九二五年级士兵延期复员而举行的若干大城市地方守备部队的示威，已得到意共的声援。意共六代大会曾通过决议，要求一九二五年级士兵立即复员。团结报揭露：“目前在意大利当权的各政党，企图在选举前夕向人民挑战”。该报力称：“显然，警察与美军决不能达到制压人民的目的。”\n    【新华社陕北十六日电】罗马讯：意大利罢工浪潮继续高涨。在意总工会号召下，全国十六万税务机关雇员已于十二日晨宣布总罢工，以支持银行雇员的罢工。意总工会秘书处于十三日举行会议，向团结一致，在全国范围内进行了持续二周英勇斗争的十万银行雇员致敬，秘书处并再度表示支持银行雇员的斗争。工潮并波及那不勒斯，二千六百名矿工为要求改善劳动条件而进行罢工，并占领煤矿数处。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Telegram\n\n　　\"Our Lesson\"\n  　Speech by Wang Yuanshou, Magistrate of Pingding County\n    Comrade Wang Yuanshou is from Haojia Village, Pingding First District, 45 years old this year. He was born into a poor peasant family, never went to school, is illiterate, begged for food as a child, and worked as a hired laborer for more than 30 years from the age of nine. After the Anti-Japanese War, he joined the revolution and served as a village and district cadre. Last year, he was transferred to Pingding County as a member of the County Federation of Trade Unions, and is now the Magistrate of Pingding County. He joined the Communist Party in 1929.\n    After listening to this meeting, I feel liberated in my mind. The liberation of the peasants is also the liberation of me; my liberation is also the liberation of the peasants, this is my feeling. Taking myself as an example, in politics, I think this meeting represents the peasants of the entire Border Region. Today, I dare to come here to say a few words, which is a political liberation. Economically, the clothes I am wearing now are complete, without patches, and I eat my fill with rice and corn flour. I feel very happy with this current life.\n    Secondly, I agree with what all the comrades talked about at the meeting. My mind is greatly opened up, and my heart is also very open. At this time, I feel that the peasants are liberated, and if the peasants are liberated, I am liberated; if the peasants are not liberated, I am not liberated. The other day, a comrade said a sentence, he said what do we take to give lessons to the peasants? What kind of lesson do we teach? Afterwards, I thought the peasants' lesson is the peasants' suffering, the peasants' stones, this is the lesson. When we go down this time, we will give the peasants lessons on the spirit we have learned, and the peasants will also give us lessons. Lesson compared to lesson is a very good lesson. This is something I personally feel, whatever suffering the peasants have is what lesson it is, this is also something I personally experienced.\n    Landlords are sin, peasants are suffering. The peasants' suffering is too much to count. Hired laborers have the suffering of hired laborers, tenant farmers have the suffering of tenant farmers, those who borrow money have the suffering of borrowing money, suffering from eating bran, suffering from eating vegetables, those who load kilns have the suffering of loading kilns, those who go down kilns have the suffering of going down kilns. Shop assistants, workers, barbers, opium smokers, opera singers... like those kilns at Yangquan Station, we are all poor people, whose children are they, they are all children of poor families! His father does it, his children do it, always doing such hard work.\n    There is also a kind of sin: happy things, addictive things, having food, having clothing, having a big wife, a second wife, a small wife, maids, smoking opium, drinking liquor, bullying women, who does these things? Landlords, rich peasants, local tyrants, those who eat people do these things! This is what I experienced.\n    Sin is done by landlords, rich peasants, and local tyrants, suffering is suffered by the children of poor families, suffered by the fathers of poor families.\n    What are we doing these years? It's called moving stones! In the past, they killed poor people and oppressed poor people. They were afraid of local tyrants and landlords, their hearts were cold, their faces were afraid, they couldn't turn over. This time, after listening to this meeting, I have already turned over, turning the world upside down! This is what I thought in my heart this time. Speaking of suffering, let me give two or three more examples: the shepherds are suffering, it rains heavily in summer, and the wind blows hard in winter, they herd a flock of sheep, and go up the mountain to herd sheep. They have no home, \"soldiers don't leave the camp, horses don't leave the pen, shepherds can't leave the stinky sheep pen.\" When it rains heavily, or the wind blows hard, they have to be in the wild. When it hails heavily, they also have to be in the wild. At this time, what is the first thing the landlord says? \"I hope my sheep haven't been hailed by the rain?! The shepherds are unreliable!\" What does the shepherd's mother say? \"My child is in the rain, the rain is so heavy, I hope my child hasn't been hailed!\"\n    When the wet nurse cooks, what does the landlord say? \"The wet nurse cooks, half of her body is lost.\" The wet nurse cooks for others like this!\n    Poor people, the suffering of working as hired laborers is endless. In the summer, people kill watermelons and drink them with white sugar, but the poor hired laborers sit in the doorway drinking water. You still have to look when drinking plain water, if the weather is early, you can drink a little more, if the weather is not early, you have to drink a little less.\n    There is a budget for hired laborers eating white flour. I don't know about other places, but in Pingding, hired laborers eat five meals of white flour a year: one meal at wheat harvest, one meal on July 15th, one meal on June 6th, one meal on August 15th, and one meal when the work is finished. If you want to eat more, you have to wait for the master and his relatives to die, and eat one more meal when carrying the dead. The suffering of hired laborers is endless. This time, we have understood this spirit, and when we go down, we will move stones with the peasants. The peasants have given us lessons, and we have also given lessons to the peasants. Lesson against lesson to move the stones.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “我们的课”　平定县长王元寿的讲话\n\n1948-01-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“我们的课”\n  　平定县长王元寿的讲话\n    王元寿同志平定一区郝家庄人，今年四十五岁，出身贫农家庭，从小没念过书，不识字，小时讨过饭，从九岁起干了三十多年长工，抗战后参加革命，当过村干部、区干部，去年调到平定县当县工会委员，现在是平定县县长，二十九年参加共产党。\n    这次听了这个会，我脑筋里面自己觉得解放了。解放了农民，也就解放了我；我解放了，农民也就解放了，这是我感觉的一点。拿我自己来说，在政治上，我想这个会，是代表全边区农民的，今天我敢上这里来说几句话，这是政治上的解放。在经济上，这时候我穿的衣服囫囵了，没有补绽，吃的饱子、大米、玉米面，这阵的生活我感觉很高兴。\n    其次，会上大家同志谈的我都同意，脑筋炸开很大，心也放开很宽，这时我感觉农民放开了，农民放开了，我就放开了；农民放不开，我就放不开。那一天某同志谈了一句话，他说咱们下去给农民上课，拿什么上呢？上什么课呢？后头我想农民的课就是农民的苦，农民的石头，这就是课。咱们这次下去，把咱们领会的精神给农民上课，农民也给咱们上课，课比课就是很好的课。这是我亲身感觉到的一点，农民有什么苦，就是什么课，这也是我亲身体验到的一点。\n    地主是罪，农民是苦。农民的苦就多了，倒不完。长工有长工的苦，租地有租地的苦，借钱有借钱的苦，吃糠苦，吃菜苦，装窑有装窑的苦，下窑有下窑的苦。当店员、当工人、剃头的、打大烟的、唱戏的……象阳泉站的那些窑上，咱都是苦人，这是谁家的孩啦，都是穷光蛋家的孩！他老子做，他孩子做，尽做这样的苦事。\n    还有一种罪：高兴事、受瘾事、有吃、有穿、有大老婆、二老婆、小老婆、丫环、抽大烟、喝烧酒、欺负妇女，谁做的？地主、富农、恶霸，吃人的人做的！这是我体验到的。\n    罪是地主、富农、恶霸做的，苦是穷人家孩受的，穷人家老子受的。\n    咱们这几年做的叫什么呢？叫做打石头呀！过去他们杀穷人，压迫穷人。对恶霸、对地主是怕的，心里头一寒，脸面上害怕，翻不起来。这次我听了这个会，已经往起翻了，翻天着地的！这是我这回心里想的事。说苦的事情，我再举两三个例子：放羊工人苦，夏天下大雨，冬天刮大风，他们赶上一群羊，上山放羊。他没有家，“兵不离营，马不离圈，放羊的离不了臭羊圈。”下一场大雨，刮一股大风，也得在野地。下大雹，也得在野地。这时候地主头一句说什么话呢？“我那羊没有给雨泊着吧？！放羊的靠不住！”放羊的母亲说什么呢？“俺孩子在雨地，雨下的这样大，没有泊着俺孩哇！”\n    奶孩做饭，地主说什么呢？“奶孩做饭。舍身一半”。奶孩做饭的就给人家做这个！\n    穷人，干长工的苦就说不完。夏天人家杀西瓜和白糖喝，穷长工坐在门圪牢里喝水。喝白水还得看一看，天气早了多喝一点，天不早了就得少喝一些。\n    长工吃白面有预决算，旁的地方我不知道，按平定来说，长工一年吃五顿白面：麦收一顿，七月十五一顿，六月六一顿，八月十五一顿，下工一顿，就吃这五顿白面。要想再吃，就是等主家和他的亲戚死了人，给人家抬死人的时候多吃一顿。长工的苦事是说不完的。这回我们领会了这个精神，下去给农民搬石头，农民的课给咱们上了，咱们也给农民上了课。课对课来把石头搬了。\n    　　　（新华社晋察冀电）"

    "content": "Jianghan Liberated Area Spans Seven Hundred Li\n  　Controlling Both Banks of the Xiang River and Threatening Wuhan\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, 16th】A frontline reporter reports on the current situation in the Jianghan Liberated Area, stating: The Hubei, Henan, and Anhui Liberation Army crossed the Pinghan Railway to the west and swept across western Hubei. From December 14th of last year to January 9th of this month, in less than a month, it liberated a vast area with a momentum like thunder, extending from Anlu and Yingshan in the east to Xiangyang and Jingmen in the west, from Sui County and Xiangyang in the north to Heyang and Jianli in the south, spanning seven hundred li and possessing a population of three million. This victory is of utmost significance. Not only did it cause the Chiang bandits to lose the rich areas on both banks of the Xiang River (i.e., the Han River), but it also cut off the highway from Hankou directly to Baoji (after the Longhai Railway was destroyed by us, this road became the Chiang bandits' transportation artery connecting the Northwest and Central China), severing Sichuan and Shaanxi from the Chiang bandit-controlled areas. Furthermore, it prevents the Chiang bandits from effectively supporting the Northwest battlefield and urgently transporting large quantities of Sichuan grain to other frontlines in the future. The Chiang bandit forces in the Jianghan area were originally extremely empty, and the remaining security forces of Hubei Province either fled at the sight of battle or were trapped and annihilated. Their 2nd and 4th Regiments have been successively annihilated in Zhongxiang and Sui County. Last month, when the Liberation Army advanced to the east bank of the Xiang River and approached the Tianmen and Qianjiang area on the outskirts of Wuhan, the Chiang bandits hurriedly drew a part of the 85th Division guarding Wuhan from eastern Hubei to aid in the west. This unit, fearing annihilation by us, had to wander between the Xiang River and the Jing River. In fact, under the powerful offensive of our Central Plains three main forces, the Chiang bandits, lacking sufficient troops, find it extremely difficult to mobilize more troops to the Jianghan Liberated Area. Now the Jianghan Liberated Area is in an extremely favorable situation. After the liberation of Sui County, this area has been connected to the Tongbai Liberated Area, and the vast Liberated Area west of the Pinghan Railway has become even stronger and more powerful. The people of Jianghan, with more than 20 years of revolutionary tradition, are also launching movements to turn themselves over everywhere, destroying feudal rule, following the continuous victories of the Liberation Army. The gradual consolidation and increasing expansion of the Jianghan Liberated Area can be anticipated.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 江汉解放区纵横七百里　控制襄河两岸威胁武汉\n\n1948-01-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　江汉解放区纵横七百里\n  　控制襄河两岸威胁武汉\n    【新华社鄂豫皖前线十六日电】前线记者报导目前江汉解放区形势称：鄂豫皖解放军西越平汉路，横扫鄂西，从去年十二月十四日迄本月九日，不到一个月的时间，以迅雷之势，解放了东起安（陆）应（山），西迄襄（阳）荆（门），北至随（县）襄（阳）；南达河（阳）监（利），纵横七百里，拥有三百万人口的广大区域。此一胜利，意义至为重大。不但使蒋匪失去襄河（即汉水）两岸的丰饶地区，而且切断了汉口直通宝鸡的公路（陇海路被我拆毁后，此路曾成为蒋匪联通西北与华中的交通干线），将川陕从蒋匪统治区域割裂开来，并使蒋匪此后不能有效的支援西北战场，和大批运出川粮至其他前线救急。江汉地区的蒋匪兵力，本极空虚，而残留之湖北省保安团队，每战不是望风而窜，即困守受歼，其二、四两总队，已先后于钟祥、随县被歼灭。上月解放军挺进襄河东岸及迫近武汉外围之天（门）潜（江）一带时，蒋匪慌忙从鄂东抽出警卫武汉的八十五师一部西援，该部因怕被我歼灭，只好徘徊于襄河与荆河之间。事实上在我中原三大主力的强大攻势下，兵力不足的蒋贼，要想抽调更多人马到江汉解放区来，已是极其困难了。现在江汉解放区正处在极有利的情况中。随县解放后，本区已与桐柏解放区联成一片，平汉西侧广大解放区至此已更为强大有力，而具有二十余年革命传统的江汉人民，亦正随着解放军的不断胜利，到处展开翻身运动，摧毁封建统治，江汉解放区的逐步巩固和日益扩大，是可以预期的。"

    "content": "【Taiyue News】The Cuiying Village Textile School in the Fourth District of Fushan became a haven for the objects of landlord struggle and has recently been dissolved. This textile school was established in February of the 34th year of the Republic (1945). Among the seventeen people inside, only four were hired poor peasant women, three were middle peasants, and ten were daughters and daughters-in-law of landlords. The landlord Li Kuide's family alone had four daughters and daughters-in-law. This \"school\" hired two teachers, one was the special agent Bai Shengcang, and the other was Shan Yingjie, the daughter of a large landlord (because she was a teacher, she was also given 9 mu of fruit land and two cave dwellings; the 9 mu of land yielded more than 6 shi of grain last year). This \"school\" used 3 shi and 4 dou of fruit wheat, more than 8 jin of cotton, and more than 3 jin of thread from the masses. It occupied 6 cave dwellings and 23 mu of land (including more than 1 mu of vegetable garden and irrigated land, and more than 20 mu of wheat land, which yielded 6 shi and 2 dou of wheat last summer). In two years and eight months, only one and a half women in this \"school\" learned to pull the loom, and the accounts were always in the red. The teacher Bai Shengcang had illicit relations with the landlord's daughters and daughters-in-law, Chen Yuexiang and Gao Fengxiang. These two women also became sworn sisters, enticing cadres into corruption. This den of vipers hid in the school, enjoying good food and being lazy, oppressing hired poor women, and living off the labor of hired poor women. For example, hired poor women Zhang Bochun and Weisheng had to cook meals, wash pots, keep watch, and sweep the floor every day, and also spin 4 liang of thread. They were often restrained by these vipers. During the mass movement, these landlord women tried to prevent middle and poor peasant women from participating in the struggle; in production, the spun thread was coarse and the woven cloth was of poor quality, and the income was not enough to cover the expenses. They invested 50,000 yuan of funds in the pig slaughterhouse of the poor peasant Wu Zhenhe, earning a profit of 8,000 yuan a month, and also invested more than 6 shi of wheat in the cooperative to generate profits. In two years and eight months, the masses not only did not benefit, but lost a lot of struggle fruits, raised a group of landlord struggle objects, and continued to oppress and exploit the masses, undermining the work. Some of the middle and poor peasant women inside could not stand their oppression for a long time and slowly escaped, eventually leaving only the landlord struggle objects. Now this \"school\" has been dissolved.\n\n    　　Why could this \"air-raid shelter\" exist for more than two years? The leadership should carefully examine it. Dissolving it is not enough; the crimes of these struggle objects should be thoroughly investigated, recorded, and punished in the upcoming land redistribution movement.\n    　　　　-- Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 浮山崔茔村纺织学校成了地主的安乐窝\n\n1948-01-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　浮山崔茔村纺织学校成了地主的安乐窝\n    【太岳消息】浮山四区崔茔村的纺织学校，成了地主斗争对象的安乐窝，最近把它解散了。这个纺织学校是三十四年二月成立的，里边十七个人，雇贫农妇女只有四个，中农三个，地主的闺女媳妇倒有十个。地主李奎德一家就有闺女媳妇四人。这个“学校”请过两个教员，一个是特务柏生苍，一个是大地主的闺女陕英杰（她因为是教员，还分了果实地九亩，窑二孔，九亩地去年打了六石多粮食）。这个“学校”用去群众的果实麦三石四斗，棉花八斤多，线子三斤多，占用窑洞六孔，地二十三亩（内有菜园水地一亩多，麦地二十多亩，去夏收麦六石二斗）。二年零八个月，这个“学校”中，只有一个半妇女学会拉梭机，每次算帐都是赔钱。教员柏生苍与地主的闺女媳妇陈月香、高凤香胡搞，这两个妇女又结拜为干姊妹，引诱干部腐化。这一窠毒虫藏在学校里，好吃懒做，欺压雇贫妇女，靠雇贫妇女劳动过活。如雇贫妇女张伯春、卫生每天做饭洗锅，看门扫地，还得纺四两线。常常受这些毒虫们的克制。在群众运动时，这些地主妇女想法阻止中贫农妇女参加斗争；在生产上纺的线粗，织的布不好，收入不够开支。她们把资金五万元投入贫农吴振河的杀猪坊，一月收利八千元，又把麦子六石多投入合作社生利。两年零八个月群众不但没有得了利，反而赔了许多斗争果实，养了一群地主斗争对象，继续欺压剥削群众，破坏工作。里边的一些中农雇贫妇女日子长了，受不了她们的压制，慢慢的逃出来，最后完全留下地主斗争对象。现在已经把这个“学校”解散了。\n    　　\n    这个“防空洞”为什么能存在两年多？领导上应该好好检查。只解散是不够的，应该把这些斗争对象的罪过查清楚，记下来，在就要到来的平分土地运动中惩办他们。\n    　　　　——编者"

A comprehensive Berlin dispatch: The conspiracy of American and British imperialism to establish a West German government has become more apparent. The authorities of the American and British occupation zones gathered the premiers of eight states and representatives of the Economic Committee of the Anglo-American Joint Occupation Zone to meet in Frankfurt on the 7th and 8th, and passed a vicious plan to split Germany that had been drafted by the US and Britain in advance. The plan stipulates the complete merger of the British and American occupation zones to establish a puppet government and to turn the Economic Committee \"into the skeleton of a puppet government in the Joint Occupation Zone\" (TASS). After the establishment of the Joint Occupation Zone, according to the Associated Press, Britain is merely a follower of the United States, and \"the most important work will be the responsibility of American officials.\" The traitorous government of France, despite humbling itself before its American master, was still despised by its American master and thrown out of the Frankfurt conference. The Schuman government, feeling ashamed, even made a coquettish protest to the US and British governments on the 11th. This arrogant act of dismembering Germany by American and British imperialism has aroused unanimous condemnation from German democratic public opinion. \"Deutsche Nachrichten\" strongly criticized the \"Frankfurt split conspiracy,\" pointing out that this was \"a dark Thursday in German history\" (note that the 8th was a Thursday). The Berliner Zeitung warned: \"The unity of Germany has been utterly devastated in Frankfurt.\" The Neue Zeit angrily denounced this move as \"a complete violation of the Potsdam Agreement and a serious blow to the unity of Germany.\" The Executive Bureau of the Democratic Women's League of Germany pointed out in a resolution on the 9th: \"The Frankfurt resolution is a new step in splitting our motherland,\" calling on \"all German women to rise up and participate in the people's movement for unity, justice, and peace.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美英积极分裂德国　激起德报一致声讨\n\n1948-01-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美英积极分裂德国\n  　激起德报一致声讨\n    【新华社陕北十五日电】综合柏林讯：美英帝国主义建立西部德国政府的阴谋，已更加表面化。美英占领区当局曾纠集八州总理和美英联合占领区经济委员会代表，于七、八两日在佛兰克福开会，并通过了由美英事先拟好的分裂德国的险毒计划。该计划规定完全合并英美占领区，成立傀儡政府，把经济委员会“变成联合占领区傀儡政府的骨架”（塔斯社）；联合占领区建立后，据合众社透露：英国仅为美国的从仆，“最重要的工作将由美官员负责”。法国的卖国政府，虽对美国不惜卑躬屈膝呼爹称奴，但仍遭其美国主人的鄙弃而抛之于佛兰克福会议门外，舒曼政府羞赧之余，竟于十一日向美英政府提出了撒娇式的抗议。美英帝国主义此种肢解德国的狂妄举动，已激起德国民主舆论的一致声讨。“德意志新闻”力责“佛兰克福的分裂阴谋”，指出这是“德国历史上是黑暗的星期四”（按八日是星期四）。柏林新闻警告称：“德国的统一，已在佛兰克福受尽摧残”。新时报怒斥此举“为完全违反波茨顿协定，严重打击了德国的统一”。德国妇女民主联合会执行局九日决议指出：“佛兰克福决议是分裂我祖国的新步骤”，号召“一切德国妇女奋起参加为统一与正义和平的人民运动”。"

Second, due to the impending US presidential election, both the Democratic and Republican parties are unwilling to bear the responsibility for the \"Marshall Plan,\" as the plan is extremely unpopular among the broad masses in the United States, in order to win votes. Third, the rapid deterioration of the situation in some countries under the dollar yoke. For example, Greece, despite the \"aid\" of gold dollars, has still led to the defeat of the royalist fascists. Fourth, the members of the US Congress have been shocked by the perilous state of the economic crisis in Western European countries.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: News from various sources: Just as the US Congress is discussing the \"Marshall Plan,\" newspapers in Western European countries, from progressive to reactionary, are criticizing it, indicating that the aggressiveness of the \"Marshall Plan\" is becoming increasingly \"obvious\" (TASS). The British Communist Party's organ, the Daily Worker, stated on the 7th: \"The truth is now clear: the United States intends to dump certain goods in Europe, and for this purpose, it will restrict the production of goods in Europe that would compete with the United States.\" The reactionary \"Daily Express\" also said on the 8th: \"According to the 'Marshall Plan,' more than half of the total value of American supplies to Britain is used for non-essential goods, so it is absurd for Britain to think that the plan can save it from economic disaster.\" The Danish newspaper \"Holbaek Amts Social-Demokrat\" stated on the 12th: \"The 'charitable face' of the Marshall Plan is only to achieve a commercial purpose, and those who are aided must accept conditions equivalent to the orders of a leader.\" Some Danish newspapers have even protested against the United States' desire to sell old ships to Denmark, and even the government organ \"Social-Demokraten\" and the conservative \"Berlingske Tidende\" have \"satirically commented on the Marshall Plan\" in their columns. \"Berlingske Tidende\" also published a cartoon comparing Denmark to a cow longing for doughnuts, while mocking the Marshall Plan for giving it tobacco instead. The Rotterdam business community's organ, \"Rotterdamsch Nieuwsblad,\" stated on the 12th: \"During the war, the United States built a large number of merchant ships, which are now outdated, and now the United States wants to 'lend' them to the Netherlands. If the American demands are met, our shipbuilding industry and other revitalizing industries will suffer a heavy blow.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Washington dispatch: The American people fiercely oppose the Marshall Plan. The American afternoon newspaper has recently published many letters from readers, all of which are opposed to the Marshall Plan. One of them, Adoulay, wrote: \"The Marshall Plan is a carefully formulated plan by Wall Street, with the assistance of the US government, to dominate the world.\" Picolet is convinced that this plan \"cannot solve the economic difficulties of Western Europe.\" Jennings wrote: This will \"amount to establishing fascist governments in Western Europe.\" Slaton believes that the Marshall Plan is \"doomed to failure\" because it will \"greatly accelerate inflation in the United States.\" Vorner said: \"The Marshall Plan will sow the seeds of discord and lead to new wars.\" Agilas said: \"The purpose of this plan is to combat the progress and liberalism of various countries under the guise of 'red terror,' but this plan sows the seeds of hatred and will inevitably reap its own consequences.\" Even the reactionary New York Times was forced to admit the opposition of the broad masses of the American people to the Marshall Plan. The newspaper published the results of its reporter's survey of public opinion in more than a dozen major cities on the 6th, stating: \"People in the central and western regions of the United States have expressed opposition to the Marshall Plan,\" and \"people in many regions have expressed considerable indifference.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “老鼠过街人人喊打”　马歇尔计划继续遭痛斥\n\n1948-01-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“老鼠过街人人喊打”\n  　马歇尔计划继续遭痛斥\n    【新华社陕北十六日电】莫斯科讯：劳动报于九日评论“马歇尔计划”称：鼓励“马歇尔计划”的辩护人范登。堡拟将“马歇尔计划”法案中的“一百七十亿美元的数字”勾销一事，反映了：第一、“马歇尔计划”遇到了美国广大人民的强烈反对。第二、由于美总统选举期近，为了争取选票，民主和共和两党都不愿多担负“马歇尔计划”的责任，因该计划在美国广大群众中非常不得人心。第三、在美元枷锁下的某些国家局势的急转直下。例如希腊，尽管金元怎样“援助”，但仍使保皇党法西斯分子遭受失败。第四、美国国会议员已被西欧各国的经济危机的险境所震惊。\n    【新华社陕北十六日电】各方讯：正当美国会讨论“马歇尔计划”的时候，西欧各国报纸，从进步的到反动的都纷纷予以抨斥，这表示“马歇尔计划”的侵略性，更益“变得明显”（塔斯社）。英共机关报工人日报七日称：“真相现已大白，美国是打算在欧洲倾销某些货品，为此就要限制欧洲生产那些会与美国竞争的货品。”反动的“每日快报”亦于八日说：“按照‘马歇尔计划’，美国对英供应的总值，其中用于非必需品的，占了一半以上，所以，对英国来说，认为该计划可以把英国从经济灾难中拯救出来，是荒谬的。”丹麦的“荷尔贝卡茨社会民主党人报”于十二日称：“马歇尔计划的‘慈善面孔’，只是要达到一种商业目的，被援助者必须接受等于领袖命令的一些条件”。若干丹麦报纸更抗议美国想把旧船卖给丹麦，连政府机关报“社会民主党人”报和保守的“贝林斯克日报”，也在专栏中“讽剌地评论马歇尔计划”。“贝林斯克日报”还刊载了一幅漫画，把丹麦比成一条渴望油饼的母牛，而讥剌马歇尔计划却给它以烟草。荷兰鹿特丹企业界的机关报“鹿特丹新闻”于十二日称：“在战争期中，美国造了大量商船，这些商船已陈旧，而现在美国却想把它们‘借’给荷兰，假如满足了美国要求，我们的造船业及其他复兴工业，将遭受沉重的打击。”\n    【新华社陕北十六日电】华盛顿讯：美国人民猛烈反对马歇尔计划。美国下午报最近连续发表了许多读者来信，都是反对马歇尔计划的，其中阿都莱写道：“马歇尔计划是代表华尔街在美国政府协助下精心拟定的统治全世界的计划”。皮柯莱深信：这计划“不能解决西欧经济困难问题”。金宁斯写道：这将“等于建立西欧各法西斯政府”。斯莱顿认为马歇尔计划“注定了要失败”，因为它将“大大地加速美国的通货膨胀”。佛纳称：“马歇尔计划将散下纠纷的种子、导向新战争”。阿吉拉斯说：“这种计划的目的是要在‘红色恐怖’的掩饰下打击各国的进步和自由主义，但这一计划种下的是仇恨的种子，必将自食其果”。即使反动的纽约时报亦被迫供认美国广大人民反对马歇尔计划的情形。该报于六日发表其记者在十余个主要都市测验民意的结果称：“美国中部与西部地区人民对马歇尔计划表示反对”，“很多地区人民颇表冷淡”。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th: The Northwest Joint Defense Headquarters recently announced the battle results of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region's local armed forces, guerrillas, and militia in the past nine months (from March 12 to the end of the year) as follows: (1) 3,064 battles fought, annihilating 14,013 enemies, including 4,919 killed or wounded, 8,274 captured alive, and 820 who revolted and surrendered. According to the regular establishment of the enemy army, the number of enemies annihilated is equivalent to two brigades, two regiments, and two battalions. (2) 8 enemy officers at the regimental level, 14 at the battalion level, and 67 at the company and platoon level were captured alive. (3) Captured one mountain gun, one rocket launcher, and 27 artillery pieces of various calibers, 89 grenade launchers and rifle grenade launchers, 231 machine guns of various types, 3,709 rifles and pistols, 2,752 artillery shells, 9,673 grenades, rifle grenades, and hand grenades, 538,377 rounds of ammunition, 264 war horses, 1,166 livestock, 3 radio stations, 3 reporting machines, 42 telephones, 3,604 *shi* of grain, and a portion of other military supplies, and 25 vehicles. Destroyed 1,671碉堡 fortifications, two bridges, and shot down two airplanes.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th: General Wang Weizhou, Deputy Commander of the Northwest Joint Defense Army, spoke on the battle achievements of the local armed forces in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region over the past nine months, saying: During the same period that the Northwest People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 61,000 enemies, our local armed forces and guerrillas also annihilated more than 14,000 enemies. Now, not only is the field army much stronger than in the past, but the local armed forces have also grown more than threefold. The enemies on the Northwest battlefield have become increasingly weakened and insignificant in the face of our tremendous military victories. Deputy Commander Wang recalled that in these nine months, the people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region transitioned from ten years of peaceful life to all-out war, which was a major transformation and test. However, the people of the Border Region, tempered by the Land Revolution War, were not frightened by the ferocious enemy, but quickly organized themselves, armed themselves, and resolutely eliminated all invading bandit troops. Now the enemy has not only lost a lot of soldiers and equipment, but also been forced into a defensive position. In the future, our field army will attack and eliminate large groups of enemies, while our local armed forces will eliminate small groups of enemies and surround and harass isolated enemies.\n\nDeputy Commander Wang summarized the current situation between the enemy and us, saying: The Chiang-Hu bandit troops are now only trapped in isolated cities and some narrow areas such as Yan'an, Ganquan, ＠ County, Qingyang, Heshui, Zhenyuan, Yanchi, Dingbian, and Anbian, while vast areas have been recovered by us. The original Border Region now has the following county towns (including newly established counties) in our hands: Suide, Mizhi, Qingjian, Wubao, ＠ County, Zizhou, Zhenchuan, Hengshan, Yanchuan, Yanchang, Gulin, Zichang, Ansai, Zhidan, Jingbian, Wuqi, Huanxian, Quzi, Huachi, Xinzheng, Xinmin, Chishui, Chunyao, and other more than 20 cities, and with the continuous attacks of our local armed forces, new liberated areas have been developed and many new democratic regimes have been established. In the Guanzhong sub-district, in addition to expanding the three new districts of Tuqiao, Guanzhuang, and Liangzhuang in Chishui County, the people's power has been newly established in the four counties of Zhong (bu) Yi (jun), Gouyi, ＠ County, and Sanyuan, and the area has expanded almost doubled compared to the past. In the Yuheng area, in addition to expanding several districts and townships in ＠ County and Zhenchuan, the city of Shenmu has also been liberated, and the decrees of the democratic regime can directly reach the suburbs of Yulin. The Huanglong Mountain area, a military stronghold of the Chiang-Hu bandit army, is also controlled by our guerrillas, and the reactionary Baojia system has been destroyed in many villages in the area, and people's armed forces and political power have been established. The 120,000 people of Huanglong Mountain, who have been squeezed by the Chiang-Hu bandit army for many years, will more actively participate in the struggle.\n\nDeputy Commander Wang then made an appropriate analysis and assessment of the great role of the local armed forces in the nine-month self-defense war, pointing out: (1) They cooperated with the main force to strike and contain the enemy, and recovered and controlled the enemy-occupied areas. For example, our local armed forces fought 3,064 battles in nine months, annihilating 14,013 enemies, averaging about eleven battles per day, and annihilating more than fifty enemies per day. This frequent and proactive attack, the tactic of accumulating small victories into big victories, made it difficult for the enemy to move, often being beaten, and increasingly weakened. Our local armed forces can also use tactics of concentrating forces and joint attacks to achieve victory. For example, the Chunyao guerrillas captured Shipo, the ＠ County, Ganquan, and Zhidan county guerrillas captured Zhangcun and Zhiluozhen, the Yan'an guerrillas attacked Lijiaqu, and the Ansai guerrillas attacked Yandianzi and Xiaobiangou, forcing the Chiang-Hu bandits to shrink their occupied areas and retreat to isolated cities. The enemy once attempted to concentrate its forces to \"suppress\" the suburbs, but it was crushed by our guerrillas who dispersed and persisted in the struggle in their original locations. At present, our local armed forces are still active in the near suburbs of Yan'an City, and leaflets and slogans are still transmitted to the urban area as usual. In addition, guerrillas participated in battles such as Yangmahe, Panlong, and Chakou. A certain unit of the Suide local corps encircled and annihilated the Hu bandit assault division, and a certain unit of the Sanbian local corps repulsed the fleeing enemy Ma bandit Bao Fourth Regiment, which played a direct cooperative role. (2) They attacked the Chiang area, destroyed the Baojia system, and expanded and established new liberated areas. For example, the Guanzhong sub-district and Yuheng area have been expanded, and democratic regimes have been established in the vast villages of the Huanglong Mountain area. When our army besieged Hancheng, the local masses mobilized 500 carts and hundreds of stretchers to help us transport supplies and rescue the wounded. (3) They persisted in the anti-\"suppression\" struggle and protected the safety of the masses. Guerrillas in various places covered the transfer of the masses during the \"suppression\" by the Chiang-Hu bandit army, armed and defended production, and cracked down on the enemy's conspiracies and atrocities of looting grain, conscripting men, and merging villages.\n\nFinally, Deputy Commander Wang encouraged the local armed forces in the Border Region to work harder on the basis of victory, avoid complacency, and further cooperate with the main force in an organized and planned manner to eliminate the Chiang-Hu bandit army in the Border Region and welcome the victorious 1948.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 西北地方武装壮大三倍　九个月歼敌一万四千\n\n1948-01-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　西北地方武装壮大三倍\n  　九个月歼敌一万四千\n    【新华社西北十六日电】西北联防军司令部顷公布陕甘宁边区地方武装、游击队及民兵去年九个月（自三月十二日至年底）战绩如下：（一）作战三千零六十四次，歼敌一万四千零一十三名，内毙伤敌四千九百一十九名，生俘八千二百七十四名，起义投诚八百二十名。按照敌军正规编制计算，歼敌数目相等于两个旅两个团又两个营。（二）生俘敌团级军官八名，营级军官十四名，连排级军官六十七名。（三）缴获山炮、火箭炮各一门及各种口径炮二十七门，掷弹筒及枪榴弹筒共八十九个，各种机枪二百三十一挺，长短枪三千七百零九支，炮弹二千七百五十二发，掷弹、枪榴弹及手榴弹共九千六百七十三颗，子弹五十三万八千三百七十七发，战马二百六十四匹，牲口一千一百六十六匹，电台三部，话报机三部，电话机四十二部，粮食三千六百零四石及其他军用品一部，汽车二十五辆。摧毁碉堡工事一千六百七十一座，桥梁二座，击毁飞机二架。\n    【新华社西北十六日电】西北联防军副司令员王维舟将军，对九个月来陕甘宁边区地方武装战绩发表谈话说：在西北人民解放军歼敌六万一千多人的同一期间，我地方武装和游击队也歼敌一万四千多人。现在不仅野战军比过去强大得多，地方武装也壮大了三倍以上。西北战场上的敌人在我们军事的巨大胜利面前，变得日益衰弱和渺小了。王副司令员回忆这九个多月中，陕甘宁边区人民从十年的和平生活转到全面战争，这是一个重大的转变和考验。但是经过土地革命战争锻炼出来的边区人民，并没有被张牙舞爪的敌人吓退，而是迅速地组织起来，武装起来，坚决消灭一切进犯匪军。现在敌人不但损失了很多兵员和装备，而且被迫处于防御地位。今后我们的野战军将进攻并消灭大股的敌人，我们的地方武装，则消灭小股敌人和围困袭扰孤立的敌人。\n    王副司令员概述目前敌我形势说：蒋胡匪军现在仅困守延安、甘泉、＠县、庆阳、合水、镇原、盐池、定边、安边等孤城和一些狭窄地带，广大地区都被我收复。原边区现在我手中的县城（包括新设县）有：绥德、米脂、清涧、吴堡、＠县、子洲、镇川、横山、延川、延长、固临、子长、安塞、志丹、靖边、吴旗、环县、曲子、华池、新正、新民、赤水、淳耀等二十余城，并且在我地方武装不断出击下，发展了新解放区，建立许多新的民主政权。关中分区除赤水县扩大了土桥、官庄、梁庄三个新区，新正县除收复了二十九年被蒋胡匪军侵占的五六两区外，并新建立了中（部）宜（君）、枸邑、＠县、三原四个县的人民政权，地区比较过去扩大了几近一倍。榆横方面除＠县、镇川扩大若干区乡外，并解放了神木县城，民主政权的政令可以直达榆林城郊。蒋胡匪军军事要地黄龙山区也被我游击队控制，已在该地许多乡村里摧毁了反动的保甲制度，建立了人民的武装和政权。被蒋胡匪军压榨多年的黄龙山十二万人民将更加积极的参加斗争。\n    王副司令员继对九个月自卫战争中，地方武装的巨大作用，作了恰当的分析和估计，他指出：（一）配合主力打击和牵制了敌人，收复和控制了敌占区。如我地方武装九个月作战三千零六十四次，歼敌一万四千零十三名，平均每天作战约十一次，每天歼敌在五十人以上，这种频繁主动的袭击，积小胜为大胜的战术，使敌人行动困难，时常挨打，日益削弱。我地方武装并能运用集中力量、联合进攻的战术，取得胜利。如淳耀游击队攻克市坡，＠县、甘泉、志丹三县游击队攻克张村、直罗镇，延安游击队袭入李家渠，安塞游击队袭入阎店子、小砭沟，迫使蒋胡匪不得不缩小占领地区，退守孤城。敌人曾经企图集中兵力“清剿”城郊，但在我游击队化整为零，坚持原地斗争下，遭到粉碎。目前我地方武装仍活跃在延安市近郊，传单标语照常传到市区内。此外如羊马河、蟠龙、岔口等战役中，游击队均参加作战。绥德地方兵团某部围歼胡匪突击师，三边地方兵团某部击溃逃敌马匪保四团，都起了直接的配合作用。（二）出击蒋区，摧毁保甲，扩大与建立了新解放区。如关中分区、榆横地区均已扩大，黄龙山区广大乡村亦已建立民主政权。在我军围攻韩城时，当地群众就动员了五百辆大车，数百付担架，帮助我转运物资，救护伤员。（三）坚持反“清剿”斗争，保护群众安全。各地游击队在蒋胡匪军“清剿”中掩护群众转移，武装保卫生产，打击了敌人抢粮、抓丁、并村的阴谋与暴行。\n    最后王副司令员勉励边区地方武装，在胜利的基础上加倍努力，切忌骄傲自满，应进一步有组织有计划的配合主力，消灭蒋胡匪军于边区内，迎接胜利的一九四八年。"

    "content": "Shao Jia Village’s Year of Land Reform\n　　Bad Cadres Monopolize the Fruits\n　　Poor and Hired Peasants Speak Up and Are Threatened with Being Buried Alive\n　　Village Cadres Embezzle and Waste the Fruits; Eating Eight Large Bowls of Food at Every Meal\n　　[Qingfeng News] In Qingfeng County's Second District, village cadres such as Shao Ti'an (head of the agricultural association of Shaojia Village), Sun Jiming (village head), Sun Fukuan, and Sun Fuchang (anti-requisition director), have suppressed hired and poor peasants, engaged in embezzlement and corruption, and monopolized most of the fruits of struggle in the village during the year or so of land reform and review. The floating wealth, worth tens of millions or more, has rarely been distributed to the masses. The hired and poor peasants still live in great suffering, urgently demanding a complete turnaround. Shaojia Village is a relatively large village in the second district of Qingfeng, where landlord rule has always been more severe than in other villages. The 26 landlord and rich peasant households own most of the land in the village. The village's 170-plus hired and poor peasant and middle peasant households own very little land. After more than a year of land reform and review in the village, a particularly large amount of land, houses, and floating wealth was recovered, but the hired and poor peasants received very little, making a turnaround impossible. At the beginning of the land reform, the masses brought out 29 large silver ingots belonging to the landlords. Shao Ti'an, Sun Jiming, Sun Fukuan, Sun Fuchang, Shao Pi'en, and others secretly sold the ingots for several million yuan (the exact amount is under investigation and may be higher), without distributing any of it to the masses. Instead, they became \"bosses\" (dongjia) and started doing business. They frequently went to Handan, Linqing, Qingfeng, and the Longwangmiao fair in Daming to sell goods, doing business for more than three months. At a profit of one million yuan per month, they earned a total of more than three million yuan. This large sum was enjoyed by the village cadres, who set up large pots in the village every day, with pork, wine, and dishes for every meal, never less than eight bowls, with stewed chicken, eggs, and pork dumplings as common fare. In a few days, they ate several large pigs. The hired and poor peasants, who worked hard but received no fruits, could not bear it any longer and boldly selected several representatives to openly approach the agricultural association head and other cadres. The hired peasant representatives said, \"How much money did we get from selling the silver ingots we struggled for? Everyone wants to divide it. When do you think we can divide it?!\" The agricultural association head Shao Ti'an and others angrily said, \"Damn it! Spreading rumors! Who told you we sold the silver ingots? Report to me, who said that?!\" The hired peasants were not afraid and said, \"If you didn't sell them, then take out the silver ingots and let everyone see them!\" \"Bastards! What right do you have to see them?! Would you dare to take responsibility if some were missing?!\" The hired peasants were cursed away by the village cadres. That night, Shao Ti'an and others, on the pretext of \"suspicion of being a special agent,\" expelled the most active hired peasant from the agricultural association. Other relatively active agricultural association members (hired and poor peasants) did not receive any fruits either and were so frightened that they dared not say another word. Whenever the village cadres held meetings, they only listened obediently. The village cadres wanted to beat the poor peasant Sun Jiwu (family of a soldier) to death with clubs, but because the masses disagreed, he was reluctantly driven out of the village, never to return (because he had raised objections to the village cadres).\n　　　　Using the \"Special Agent\" Label to Suppress People and Seize Hired Peasants' Residences\n　　Shao Ti'an's crimes are countless. When the land reform was just beginning to deepen, he secretly concealed more than 40 mu of good land for the large landlord Shao Dengshun. He used to be a financial assistant in the second district but was dismissed for massive embezzlement. His class status is wealthy middle peasant, but his current life is much better than that of a landlord. He falsely claimed to be the family of a soldier and a poor peasant, and was allocated many more fruits (his grandson went to work in a salaried factory with a very high salary), which made the masses very dissatisfied, but no one dared to mention it. Shao Ti'an wanted to build a better courtyard, so he created a pretext, taking the unallocated bad land (fruits of struggle) and forcefully wanting to exchange it for Shao Shicheng's (a hired peasant) residence. Shao Shicheng refused, saying to Shao Ti'an, \"There are five brothers in my family, it's not just mine. Let me discuss it with my five brothers first!\" Shao Ti'an was rebuffed and harbored secret schemes. He openly said to the masses, \"Shao Shicheng is a special agent! When the Fifth Army (Chiang bandit) was here, he colluded with the Fifth Army, reporting public grain and reporting to the military headquarters. He did it all. He also spreads rumors all day long. He deserves to be beaten to death with clubs!...\" He wanted to use threats to achieve his goal of exchanging Shao Shicheng's residence. When these words reached Shao Shicheng's ears, he was so terrified that he quickly asked someone to mediate. He gave his residence to Shao Ti'an with suppressed anger and apologized to him to settle the matter.\n　　　　\"If You Expose Me, I'll Take Your Head\"\n　　During the last review, the fruits of struggle in the village were piled up like mountains, surpassing any other village in Qingfeng. Three courtyards were completely filled. In order to systematically embezzle these fruits, the village cadres Shao Ti'an, Sun Jiming, Sun Fukuan, and Sun Fuchang did not keep any accounts. They guarded the fruits day and night, stealing them systematically every night. The hired and poor peasants were not only unable to receive any fruits but were not even allowed to enter the door of where the fruits were stored. When the hired and poor peasants wanted to see the fruits they had personally carried, they were driven out by the village cadres, who said, \"Get out! What are you doing here? Trying to steal something? Go ahead, if something is missing, we village cadres won't be responsible!\" This frightened the hired and poor peasants so much that no one dared to go and look. In a few days, most of these fruits were stolen by the village cadres Shao Ti'an, Sun Jiming, Sun Fuchang, Sun Fukuan, Shao Pi'en, and others. One night in mid-October, a group of village cadres led by Shao Ti'an and Sun Jiming stole sixteen large bundles (two people could barely lift one). Inside were completely multicolored foreign cloth, silk fabrics, all kinds of good cotton clothes, silk clothes, overcoats, sweaters, leather coats, etc. Coincidentally, militia member Shao Zongli encountered them on the street. Shao Ti'an said, \"Zongli! Don't tell anyone, I'll give you some clothes to wear!\" Shao Zongli said straightforwardly, \"I don't want them! These are the fruits of everyone's struggle, I can't go against my conscience. Can I not tell the masses? You take them away!\" Shao Ti'an was furious: \"Damn it! If you don't want them, fine! If you expose me, I'll take your head!\" Village heads Sun Jiming, Sun Fukuan and others were afraid of the news spreading, and advocated that Shao Zongli be given a share, but Shao Zongli resolutely refused. The village cadres were afraid of his exposure and secretly sent a few clothes to Shao Zongli's home, telling Shao Zongli's family: \"If you let the masses know, you won't be able to clear yourself!\" Sun Fuchang stole the least, but according to his nephew's wife, \"The three large cabinets he stole were not enough to hold everything, completely made of whole bolts of Shirting and silk, leather clothing…\" Some things could not be embezzled or stolen because the masses knew about them; such as cattle, mules, livestock, grinding stones, and animal harnesses. However, the village cadres came up with ways to get them in the end. Shao Ti'an sold his small cattle and \"distributed\" a large cattle to himself in the name of his contributions; he sold his small grinding stone and distributed a large grinding stone to himself, and most of the animal harnesses were also distributed by Shao Ti'an and others. They were also afraid that the masses would get other fruits, so they came up with a way to sell them at fixed prices, which were higher than the market prices. The masses looked at them and couldn't afford them. The masses said, \"It's cheaper to buy new ones at the market!\" The village cadres said, \"If you don't want them, good! We don't mind the bad ones, we want them.\" Finally, they drastically reduced the price several times, and the village cadres bought them anyway.\n　　After all the commotion, the masses did not receive any fruits. The poor and hired peasants said, \"We struggled against the landlords, but the village cadres are the ones who distribute the things!\" Regarding \"taking hired and poor peasants as the backbone,\" the village cadres said, \"Backbone, my foot! Asking him to pull the sled is to make him a backbone, to make him pull a few more times!\" Shao Huaiqin's mother, a poor peasant and family member of a soldier, said, \"When we women were carrying things, there were so many silk clothes, whole bolts of white cloth, multicolored foreign cloth, leather clothes, overcoats, good quilts, mattresses... Three large houses couldn't hold them all. But now, when it's time to distribute the fruits, all the good things have disappeared. I've asked around all three streets, and no one has received them. Where did they all go?! Why aren't they distributed to us?!\" The land in the village was sold to the masses through transactions by the village cadres, but the masses spent money to buy bad land, while the village cadres spent no money to buy good land. The poor and hired peasants in the village all knew that the fruits had been stolen and embezzled by the village cadres, and the good land had been occupied by them. Later, Shao Zongli revealed in front of the masses the secret that the village cadres had stolen sixteen large bundles at night. The whole village was discussing it, brewing the idea that they had not turned over yet, and if they wanted to truly turn over, they must force the village cadres to return the fruits!\n　　After the village cadres, led by Shao Ti'an, heard this news, they threatened Shao Huaiqin's mother, a women's activist, saying: \"Damn it! People from the county are living here. If the county cadres hear about this, I'll bury you alive in the middle of the night!\" \"Damn you! If you tell the county cadres, I'll pull your sled!\" This soldier's family member and women's association member was so frightened that she became ill. She took medicine five times and hasn't fully recovered yet. When we visited her, we entered her dilapidated house. She was sleeping in the north room, covered with a short, tattered quilt, full of large and small holes, big enough for a small sparrow to fly through. When her son told her that we had come to visit her, she raised her head and burst into tears: \"Comrades! If you had come two days later, I would have been scared to death! The village cadres were going to bury me alive again and pull my sled. Now that you've come, even if I die, you'll know how I died! I'm not afraid to die! If you dare to stand up for me, I dare to tell you everything about the village cadres, and I dare to raise issues with the village cadres in a mass meeting!\"\n　　When we asked her about her turnaround and what fruits she had received, she said, \"I received two tattered clothes that I can't even wear. I don't have matches, so I used them as kindling. All the poor peasants in our village received tattered clothes and rags, nothing valuable. I mentioned it to the village cadres, and they cursed me, saying: 'You're still complaining about being given a few tattered clothes! When the 'Central' army comes, they'll rob you of your things too! If you don't like them, don't take them!...\"\n　　We checked door to door and found that the hired and poor peasants had indeed not received any fruits. Most of the fruits had been either distributed to the village cadres or stolen by them at night. The middle peasants also received more fruits. Based on our investigation: all 170-plus hired and poor peasant households in the village have no land, no livestock, no farming tools, no houses to live in, and no food to eat..., so there's no question of turning over.\n　　(Pingyuan, Xueyi)\n　　\n　　Several despotic village cadres are suppressing the entire village of poor and hired peasants, preventing them from turning over. The poor and hired peasants are still starving, and the village cadres threaten to bury them alive if they say a word... It's good that the leadership has made an initial assessment this time. We believe that we should continue to investigate in depth, uncover the bureaucracy of the leadership, and see if anyone is shielding these audacious and reckless bad cadres. At the same time, we hope that other places will also conduct similar inspections to prepare for the upcoming equitable distribution of land. ——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 邵家村一年土地改革　坏干部独吞果实  贫雇说句话，就说要活埋\n平远　学义\n1948-01-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　邵家村一年土地改革\n  　坏干部独吞果实\n    贫雇说句话，就说要活埋\n    村干部贪污浪费果实每顿饭吃八大碗\n    【清丰消息】清丰县二区邵家村农会长邵体安、村长孙吉鸣、孙福宽、抗勤主任孙福长等村干部，在年余的土地改革和复查中，压制雇贫，贪污腐化，霸占全村大部斗争果实；约值数千万以上的浮财，群众很少分配到手。雇贫还过着非常痛苦的生活，迫切要求彻底翻身。邵家村是清丰二区比较大的村子，地主统治历来就比其他村厉害的多。地主富农共二十六户，占有全村大部土地。全村百七十余户的雇贫、中农，只有很少土地。该村经过了一年多的土地改革和复查，收回的土地、房屋、浮财特别多，可是雇贫很少分到手里，根本谈不到翻身。土地改革开始时，群众搞出地主二十九个大元宝，邵体安、孙吉鸣、孙福宽、孙福长、邵丕恩等人私自把元宝卖了数百万元（详细数目待查，可能还多），丝毫不分给群众，却自己当起老板（东家），作起买卖来了。经常到邯郸、临清、清丰、大名龙王庙贩卖货物，作了三个月以上的买卖，按一月赚百万元计，共可赚三百余万。这一大笔款，村干都享受了，每天在该村安着大锅，顿顿是猪肉、酒、菜，少不了八个碗，烧鸡、鸡蛋、猪肉饺子是家常便饭。不几天，吃了几个大猪。出力分不到果实的雇贫群众，看不下去了，大胆的选了几个代表，公开的找到农会长等干部，雇贫代表说：“咱斗争的元宝卖了多少钱呀？大家意见想分，您看看啥时分？！”农会长邵体安等人气愤地说：“妈的！特务造谣！谁给你说卖了元宝？给我报告，谁说的！”雇贫并不害怕，说：“要是没有卖，你把元宝拿出来叫俺大家看看吧！”“混蛋！你有啥资格看？！少了你敢负责不敢？！”雇贫叫村干凶走了。当天夜里，邵体安等借口“有特务嫌疑”，把最积极的雇贫开除出农会。其他比较积极的农会员（雇贫），也没分到果实，吓得再不敢说一句话，村干啥时开会，只有顺服的听。村干部想乱棍打死贫农孙吉五（军属），由于群众不同意，勉强被撵出村，一辈不准回家（因为他给村干提过意见）。\n    　　　　用特务帽子压人霸占雇农宅院\n    邵体安的罪恶是数不完的，土地改革刚一进入深入时，他秘密给该村大地主邵登顺隐蔽了四十余亩好地。他从前是二区财政助理员，因大量贪污被开除，他的成份是富裕中农；但现在生活比地主还好得多。他冒充军属、贫农，多分配了好多果实（他孙子去薪金制的工厂工作，薪金很高），群众很不满，但谁也不敢提。邵体安想盖更好的院落，于是生了个疑点，拿着未分的坏地（斗争果实），强要换邵石成（雇贫农）的庄宅，邵石成不愿意，就给邵体安说：“我弟兄五个，不是我自己的，等俺弟兄五个商量好再说吧！”邵体安碰了钉子，就心怀暗算，公开给群众说：“邵石成是特务！五军（蒋匪）在时，他通五军，报告公粮、报告军部，都是他办的。还成天造谣，真该乱棍打死！……”他想用威胁手段达到换邵石成庄宅的目的。这话传到邵石成耳朵里，吓得邵石成胆战心惊，赶快托人讲席说和，把自己的庄宅忍气吞声的给了邵体安，又给他道了歉才算完事。\n    　　　　“你要暴露了我要你的脑袋”\n    在上次复查中，该村斗争果实堆积如山，全清丰那个村都比不上，三座院填的满满的。村干邵体安、孙吉鸣、孙福宽、孙福长等人为了有计划的贪污，这些果实就没一点帐目，他们日夜看守着，每天夜里有计划的偷拿。雇贫不但分不到手，连存放果实的门也不准进。雇贫想看看自己亲手搬运的果实，进门就被村干撵出来了，并说：“出去！往这里边来干啥？想偷走东西？你进吧，少了东西俺村干不负责！”吓的雇贫谁也不敢去看了。不几天，这些果实就叫村干邵体安、孙吉鸣、孙福长、孙福宽、邵丕恩等人偷了一大部。十月中旬一个夜里，以邵体安、孙吉鸣十余人为首的村干，又偷了十六个大包袱（两个人还抬不动一个），里边完全是五色洋市布、绸缎布，各种好棉衣、绸衣、大衣、毛衣、皮大衣等；碰巧在街上被民兵队员邵宗理遇见了，邵体安说：“宗理！你可别给别人说，我给你几件衣服穿穿！”邵宗理耿直的说：“我不要！这是大家斗争出来的果实，我不能昧良心。我不给人家群众说中不？你拿走吧！”邵体安气坏了：“妈的！你不要算球！你要暴露了，我要你的脑袋！”村长孙吉鸣、孙福宽等人怕跑了风，主张叫邵宗理分一份，可是邵宗理坚决不要。村干部怕他暴露，偷偷的给邵宗理送到家去几件衣服，并给邵宗理家里人说：“要是您叫群众知道了，你也清不了秧！”孙富长偷的最少，但据他侄媳说：“他所偷的三大柜还装不完，完全是成匹的士林洋布、绸缎、皮衣……”有些东西不能贪污，也不能偷，因群众都知道；如牛骡牲畜、磨、牲口套等；可是村干部也生出了办法，终究也得到手了。邵体安把他的小牛卖了，以自己有功为名，“分”到大牛；把他的小磨卖了，分了大磨，大部分牲口套也被邵体安等分了。他们还怕群众得到别的果实，就生了个办法，定价出卖，定的价比市场还高，群众看了看，买不起。群众说的好：“还没有到集上买新的省钱！”村干说：“您不要，好！咱不嫌坏，咱要。”最后大减价几倍，还是村干买了。\n    搞来搞去，群众没分到任何果实。贫雇说：“斗争地主是俺办，分东西是村干！”对于“以雇贫为骨干”，村干部说：“骨干个吧！拉滑子是叫他当骨干，叫他多拉几下！”贫农军属邵怀勤的母亲说：“俺妇女搬东西时，绸缎衣服、成匹白洋布、五色洋布、皮衣、大衣、好被子、褥子……多着哩，三座大屋子还填不完。这会分果实时，那好东西都不见了，我前后三街都问了一遍，都没分到手里，都弄哪去啦？！不分给俺为啥？！”村里的土地都是用买卖方式由村干卖给群众，可是群众花钱买的是坏地，村干不花钱买的是好地。该村贫雇群众都知道果实是村干偷光了，贪污了，好地是他们占去了。后来，邵宗理在群众面前揭露了村干夜里偷了十六个大包袱的秘密，全村群众纷纷议论，酝酿着自己没翻了身，要想真正翻身，非叫村干退出果实不可！\n    以邵体安为首的村干部听到这风声以后，吓唬妇女积极分子邵怀勤的母亲说：“他妈的！县里人在这里住，这事情要是叫县里干部听到耳朵里，日你奶奶，半夜也得活埋你！”“日你娘！你要给县干部说了，非拉你的滑子不可！”这位军属妇女会员吓病了，吃了五次药，到现在还没好全。当我们访问她时，我们进了她的破烂房子，她正在北屋里睡觉，盖着一条又短又破烂的被子，全是大大小小的窟窿，小麻雀也可飞得进去。当她的儿子告诉她，我们来访问她时，她抬起头来，张嘴大哭起来：“同志！你们再晚来两天，我就吓死了！村干又要活埋我，又要拉我的滑子，你们来了，就是我死了，你们也知道我怎死的！我不怕死！你们敢给我作主，村干的啥事我都敢给你们说，在群众大会上也敢给村干提！”\n    当我们问她翻身情形，分了啥果实时，她说：“分了两件破衣裳，也不能穿，没洋火，就当火纸用了。俺全村贫农都是分的破衣烂套子，没一样值钱货。俺给村干提了提，叫村干大骂，还说：分给你几件破衣裳还孬呀！‘中央’军来了，还抢你的东西哩！嫌孬，你别要！……”\n    我们挨门逐户的检查了一下，雇贫确实是没分到果实，大部果实叫村干多分、夜里偷去了；中农也多分了果实。经我们调查结果：全村百七十余户雇贫，都是没地，没牲畜、耕具，没房子住，没饭吃……，根本说不上翻身。\n    　　（平远、学义）\n    　　\n    几个恶霸村干部压得全村贫雇不能翻身；贫雇还饿着肚子，说一句话村干部就要活埋……领导上这次摸了一下底，是好的，我们认为还应继续深入检查，发掘领导上的官僚主义，看看有没有人包庇这些胆大妄为的坏干部。同时希望别的地方也进行同样的检查，给就要到来的平分土地运动作准备。　　——编者"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, January 17th: The people of the Northeast Liberated Areas added a total of 1,529 kilometers of railways last year. The total operating mileage of railways in the Northeast Liberated Areas is now 6,800 kilometers. In North Manchuria, the newly built railways that have been opened to traffic since the beginning of this year total 920 kilometers, including the Jiamusi-Fujin line, the Ningnian-Nenjiang line, and the Suihua-Jiamusi line. The Jiamusi Bridge, which was restored, is second in size only to the Yellow River Railway Bridge. The Binjiang-Suifenhe line, the Huolonggou Forestry Branch Line (from Baishan to Huolonggou), the Wuchang to Lafa section of the Lafa-Binjiang line, the Lafa to Erdaogou section of the Changchun-Tumen line, and the Shuanggang to Zhengjiatun (Liaoyuan) section of the Siping-Qiqihar line have also been repaired. The Zhengjiatun-Tongliao line is currently under construction. In South Manchuria, the railway lines recovered by the People's Liberation Army during last summer's offensive were successively opened to traffic by last November after the efforts of railway workers to repair them. These include the Meihekou to Shuanghezhen section of the Jilin-Shenyang line, the Meihekou to Qingyuan section, the Meihekou to Xi'an section of the Siping-Meihekou line, and the Yayuanchu branch line (from Yayuan to Linjiang) of the Meihekou-Jian line, totaling 600 kilometers. The entire Meihekou-Jian line is expected to be open to traffic by the end of February this year. The vast majority of the road workers are emancipated peasants, so even though the weather is freezing and the ground is as hard as iron, they still get up early and work late to enthusiastically repair the railways. For example, road workers in South Manchuria built 273 kilometers of railways, 30 large and small bridges, and erected 250 kilometers of power lines in 57 days. They also automatically organized \"Material Collection Committees\" to collect various materials. Dong'an County alone collected more than 50,000 track spikes. On New Year's Day this year, grand opening ceremonies were held for the Jiafu line, the Labin line, and other lines. The Railway Bureau offered free rides to all passengers on that day to thank the people and military and government agencies for their assistance.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北翻身农民去年增修铁路三千里\n\n1948-01-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北翻身农民去年增修铁路三千里\n    【新华社东北十七日电】东北解放区人民去年一年中共增修铁路一千五百二十九公里。现在东北解放区铁路通车里程已共有六千八百公里。北满方面今年年初新修铁路先后通车的有九百二十公里，计有佳（木斯）富（锦）线，宁（年）嫩（江）线，绥（化）佳（木斯）线，其中修复之佳木斯大桥仅小于黄河铁桥，滨（江）绥（芬河）线，火龙沟林业支线（白山到火龙沟），拉（法）滨（江）线的五常到拉法段，长（春）图（们）线的拉法到二道沟段，以及平（四平）齐（齐哈尔）线的双岗到郑家屯（辽源）段。正修建的有郑（家屯）通（辽）线。南满方面：去年夏委攻势解放军收复之各线铁路，经铁路员工努力抢修，到去年十一月份先后通车的有吉（林）沈（阳）线的梅河口到双河镇段，和梅河口到清原段，四（平）梅（河口）线的梅河口到西安段，梅（河口）辑（安）线的鸭园支线（鸭园到临江），总计六百公里。梅辑全线今年二月底可通车。修建的路工绝大部分都是翻身农民，因此虽天寒地冻，地硬得象铁板，他们仍起早搭黑热烈抢修，如南满路工在五十七天内就修建铁道二百七十三公里，大小桥梁三十座，架设电线二百五十公里。他们还自动组织“收集材料委员会”收集各种资材，东安一县就收集道钉五万多颗。今年元旦佳富线，拉滨线等都举行了很隆重的通车典礼，铁路局为酬谢人民和军政机关的帮助，当天乘客完全免费。"

    "content": "Regarding Relying on Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers and Uniting with Middle Peasants - Reply to Comrades Chang Huazhi and Chen Guang\nComrades Chang Huazhi and Chen Guang:\n\nYour letter raises the issue that some comrades, while emphasizing reliance on poor peasants and hired laborers, incorrectly neglect uniting with middle peasants in practical work, and even infringe upon the interests of middle peasants. This should attract the attention of the Party. This issue is raised at a very opportune time and is very important.\n\nIn the land reform movement of the past two years and more, our region has achieved great results. However, because many comrades have a blurred class viewpoint and do not understand or do not fully understand that the issue of poor peasants and hired laborers is the fundamental issue of land reform, without which there can be no land reform or emancipation movement. Precisely because of this, land reform in our region has not been carried out thoroughly enough in some areas. Last winter's regional land conference deeply examined and criticized this point. It emphasized that land reform must rely on poor peasants and hired laborers, start from poor peasants and hired laborers, fully satisfy the demands of poor peasants and hired laborers, and fully mobilize poor peasants and hired laborers. The main symbol of whether land reform is thorough is to see whether the demands of poor peasants and hired laborers have been fully satisfied and whether poor peasants and hired laborers have been fully mobilized. The news of the land conference announced by this newspaper on December 31, emphasizing reliance on poor peasants and hired laborers, is what it means. But can this be interpreted as neglecting or slightly neglecting the issue of uniting with middle peasants? No. If so, it would be a very serious mistake.\n\nComrade Yi Bo, in his summary, discussed the basic issues of implementing land reform, saying: \"Hired laborers, poor peasants, rural workers, and all other landless and land-poor people are the most basic and most important masses in implementing land reform, the main force against feudalism, and also a large army. Hired laborers, poor peasants, and rural workers are the most numerous in the countryside. In our region, they account for more than 50% of the population in the old liberated areas and more than 70% of the population in the newly liberated areas. They are the most oppressed, exploited, and despised class in the countryside. Even some of our Communist Party members call them 'backward elements' and 'hopeless backward elements.' Little do they know that they are the most revolutionary. Without their active action and resolute struggle, any revolutionary movement or any land reform is out of the question. Therefore, our Party must unswervingly rely on hired laborers, poor peasants, rural workers, and all landless and land-poor people to form poor peasant leagues as the backbone and foundation of the land reform movement. But does this mean that we can neglect or slightly neglect the issue of uniting with middle peasants? If the middle peasants are excluded from the anti-feudal united front, can we defeat the landlords, rich peasants, and all resistance from other aspects? Without the participation of middle peasants, can land reform be carried out thoroughly? Obviously, all these arguments that despise middle peasants are unacceptable and wrong. Therefore, we must unite all middle peasants on the basis of the poor peasant leagues to form peasant associations. This is the anti-feudal united front and united army of land reform. Only by organizing all peasants according to such a camp can we completely defeat the resistance of landlords and rich peasants and completely complete the task of land reform. If our Party does not follow such a camp, that is, relying on poor peasants, hired laborers, and all poor people to form poor peasant leagues; and then, on the basis of the poor peasant leagues, unite all middle peasants to form peasant associations; and fully mobilize and unite the peasant masses, it will not be able to defeat the resistance of landlords and rich peasants, and it will not be able to carry out land reform to the end. Similarly, if the mobilization and struggle of the masses are not based on, do not take hired laborers, poor peasants, and rural workers as the foundation, the backbone, and the leadership, the peasant ranks will suffer from 'soft bone disease', and they will not be able to defeat the resistance of landlords and rich peasants, and they will not be able to carry out land reform to the end. Similarly, if hired laborers, poor peasants, and rural workers do not unite with all middle peasants and other poor people to form a broad anti-feudal united front in the countryside, and launch a 'hired tenant poor independent movement', then they will isolate themselves, and they will not be able to defeat the resistance of landlords and rich peasants, and they will not be able to carry out land reform to the end. Therefore, relying on hired laborers and poor peasants, uniting with all middle peasants, and resolutely fighting against the resistance of landlords and rich peasants is a complete line of our Party's reform of the land system, which cannot be divided.\"\n\nRegarding the issue of uniting with middle peasants, it was pointed out at the Handan Conference the year before last that one approval (approving the land demands of peasants and fully satisfying the land demands of landless and land-poor peasants) is the main one, and nine provisions for solicitude are subordinate and subject to the one approval. However, it is correct to unite with middle peasants and stipulate that their interests should not be infringed upon, that they should be absorbed into the struggle, and that they should be given certain benefits. However, some areas have made mistakes in the implementation, that is, instead of first mobilizing poor peasants and hired laborers and first satisfying their demands, they have abandoned poor peasants and hired laborers and first taken care of middle peasants, which is wrong. We must consolidate the unity of all middle peasants, but we must not repeat the mistakes of the past. Comrade Yi Bo pointed out in his summary: \"We must unite all middle peasants, but how should we understand the issue of uniting with middle peasants and how should we unite with middle peasants? What is the key? The key is that we must first satisfy the demands of poor peasants and hired laborers and first mobilize poor peasants and hired laborers. In the past, some areas and some comrades had deviations in their understanding of the issue of uniting with middle peasants. They did not first mobilize poor peasants and hired laborers, rely on poor peasants and hired laborers, to unite with middle peasants, and did not explain who should be the backbone and who should be the main body to unite with middle peasants. This is a theory of uniting with middle peasants without a class stand. In order to unite with middle peasants, it can harm the interests of poor peasants and hired laborers, it can not mobilize poor peasants and hired laborers, and even put middle peasants in a leading position, not first taking care of poor peasants and hired laborers, but first taking care of middle peasants, which is wrong. But on the other hand, it must be made clear that first taking care of poor peasants and hired laborers cannot be interpreted as a \"hired tenant poor independent movement\", not uniting with middle peasants, but excluding middle peasants from the anti-feudal united front. Without the consolidated unity with middle peasants, it is impossible to defeat the resistance of landlords and rich peasants.\n\nChairman Mao instructed us in his article \"The Present Situation and Our Tasks\": \"Here, two basic principles must be paid attention to: First, the demands of poor peasants and hired laborers must be satisfied. This is the most basic task of land reform. Second, the middle peasants must be resolutely united, and their interests must not be harmed. As long as we grasp these two basic principles, our land reform task will surely be successfully completed.\" Chairman Mao said that these are two basic principles, both called \"must\". Then, he explained in detail the specific policies for uniting with middle peasants. He said: \"When dividing land equally in various places, attention should still be paid to the opinions of the middle peasants. If the middle peasants do not agree, concessions should be made to the middle peasants. When confiscating and distributing the land and property of the feudal classes, attention should be paid to the needs of some middle peasants. When classifying class components, attention must be paid not to mistakenly classify people who are originally middle peasants into the rich peasant circle. In the peasant association committees and in the government, middle peasant activists must be absorbed to participate in the work. In the burden of land tax and support for the war, fair and reasonable principles should be adopted. These are the specific policies that our Party must adopt when carrying out the strategic task of consolidating and uniting with middle peasants.\" We should study Chairman Mao's instructions carefully and act according to these principles and policies.\n\nCan we put forward the \"poor peasant and hired laborer line\"? Yes, we can. The poor peasant and hired laborer line is the class line. We should clarify the class viewpoint on every issue. All issues and all work have class nature. In the past, many of our comrades lacked the class viewpoint, so many mistakes were made in their work. The main fatal point is that they did not start from the viewpoint of poor peasants and hired laborers. Who are the cooperatives run for? It should be clear that they are run for the peasants, first of all, for the poor peasants and hired laborers. How should the burden be apportioned? It should be fair and reasonable, that is, it should take care of the ability of the peasants to bear it, first of all, the ability of the poor peasants and hired laborers to bear it. In all things, such as joining the army, public grain, war service, loans, culture, education, writing news articles, and running blackboard newspapers... there must be a clear class nature. Some places have advocated relying on poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants, and have advocated poor peasant and hired laborer backbones, poor peasant and hired laborer leaders. Comrades with a stable class stand and a relatively clear class viewpoint can recognize that this is an issue of position, viewpoint, and method. However, many comrades with a blurred class viewpoint often regard it as just an issue of work method and cannot recognize that this is an issue that cannot be separated from class position and class viewpoint. Therefore, it is good to put forward the poor peasant and hired laborer line. The content of the poor peasant and hired laborer line is that everything must start from the interests of poor peasants and hired laborers, consult with poor peasants and hired laborers in everything, ask for the opinions of poor peasants and hired laborers in everything, rely on poor peasants and hired laborers, unite with middle peasants, and defeat the resistance of landlords and rich peasants.\n\nComrade Chang Huazhi and Chen Guang's letter\nComrades Chang Huazhi and Chen Guang wrote to this newspaper to study the \"poor peasant and hired laborer line\" issue. In addition to the above publicly answered, the following is an abstract of the two letters for reference.\n\nAbstract of Comrade Chang Huazhi's letter:\n\nWe only received the People's Daily of December 31 today. I saw that a very important paragraph in the excerpt on the masthead and the content of the summary published was written like this: \"The general spirit of the Land Law Outline is: Rely on hired laborers, poor peasants, rural workers, and all poor people, overthrow the landlords, divide the land equally, fully satisfy the demands of hired laborers and poor peasants, and fully mobilize hired laborers and poor peasants\" (Note: refers to the closing news of the regional land conference). There is no mention of the issue of uniting with middle peasants at all. I remember that when Comrade Yi Bo made a summary at the regional land conference on the 24th, he specifically talked about whether relying on hired laborers and poor peasants could mean not uniting with middle peasants. He repeatedly pointed out that relying on poor peasants and hired laborers, rural workers, uniting with middle peasants and all anti-feudal elements is a complete and inseparable line. I remember that when he talked about the general spirit of the Land Law Outline, it was also the same as above, word for word. I took great care to write it down. I think his summary is completely consistent with the spirit of Chairman Mao's report at the Central Conference on December 25 (that is, relying on poor peasants and hired laborers and consolidating the unity with middle peasants). But why is the content published in the People's Daily different? Maybe the newspaper made a mistake? Or other reasons?\n\nRecently, I listened to some reports from our cadres on taking the poor peasant and hired laborer line in production and famine relief work. In two or three places, the following phenomena have already occurred: When Jingxing and Zanhuang organized poor peasants and hired laborers in two villages, there were more than 200 households and 600-700 people in the village, but only more than 30 hired laborers and poor peasants were organized (they said they were the most authentic poor peasants and hired laborers), and the entire poor peasant and hired laborer class was not well mobilized; Jingxing Hedongpo even calculated the dividends less for middle peasants. From these facts, it can be seen that some of our cadres tend to be one-sided when accepting a new spirit. Please instruct whether it is correct.\n\nChang Huazhi, January 5\n\nAbstract of Comrade Chen Guang's letter:\n\nAfter reading the second edition of the People's Daily of December 12, the two-special instructions, entitled \"Implement the Poor Peasant and Hired Laborer Line, Organize Winter Production.\" The short commentary on the same edition also said: \"The poor peasant and hired laborer line must be implemented in the winter production movement.\" I think this statement is problematic. What is the \"poor peasant and hired laborer line\"? It has not been seen or heard of in the Party's documents in the past. In the mass mobilization land reform movement, it has always been \"mobilize poor peasants and hired laborers and unite with middle peasants\", and the poor peasant and hired laborer line has never been mentioned. This is even more necessary in the production movement. Without uniting with middle peasants, it is impossible to launch a single poor peasant and hired laborer production movement. Naturally, supporting the production of poor peasants and hired laborers as the focus, but is supporting the focus and leading the focus called the \"poor peasant and hired laborer line\"? It cannot be said like that. What impression does this statement give to the working cadres below? It will be a one-sided \"poor peasant and hired laborer line\", and getting the poor peasants and hired laborers involved is equal to everything. What is the impression of the middle peasant masses? It will be \"we only need poor peasants and hired laborers in production, and we are not needed.\" This one-sided influence should be fully estimated. As originally understood, the production movement is just like launching a land struggle, and should be a production mutual aid movement based on \"relying on poor peasants and hired laborers and uniting with middle peasants\". I think it is more appropriate for Xinhua Daily to propose \"relying on poor peasants and hired laborers to unite with middle peasants\" or \"organizing poor peasants and hired laborers to take the lead in developing winter production\".\n\nChen Guang, December 16\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 关于依靠贫雇团结中农答复常化志、陈光两同志\n\n1948-01-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　关于依靠贫雇团结中农答复常化志、陈光两同志常化志、陈光两同志：\n    来信提出有些同志，强调依靠贫雇而不正确的在实际工作中忽视了团结中农，甚至侵犯中农利益，应引起党的注意。这一问题提出的很适时，很重要。\n    两年多以来的土地改革运动，在我区有很大成绩，但由于不少同志阶级观点模糊，不了解或不十分了解贫雇问题是土地改革的根本问题，少了它就根本谈不到什么土地改革翻身运动。正因为如此，我区土地改革在某些地区做的还不很彻底。去年冬全区土地会议，深刻的检查了批评了这一点。强调指出土地改革必须依靠贫雇，从贫雇出发，充分满足贫雇要求，充分发动贫雇。土地改革是否彻底的主要标帜，就是看是否充分满足了贫雇要求和充分发动起贫雇来。十二月三十一日本报公布土地会议的消息，强调依靠贫雇，就是这个意思。但这是否可以解释为可以轻视或者可以稍微轻视团结中农的问题呢？不可以的。如果那样做，则会犯很严重的错误。\n    一波同志在其总结中论述到贯彻土地改革的基本问题时，说：“雇农、贫农、乡村工人及其他一切无地少地贫民是贯彻土地改革的最基本的最主要的群众，是反封建的主力、又是大军。雇农、贫农、乡村工人，他们在乡村中人数最多，就我区说，在老解放区占人口的百分之五十以上，在新解放区占人口的百分之七十以上。他们在乡村中是最受压迫、最受剥削、和最被人轻视的阶层，连我们有些共产党员也把他们叫做‘落后分子’‘死落后’。殊不知他们革命性最强，没有他们积极行动起来，坚决进行斗争，任何革命运动、任何土地改革都是谈不到的。因此，我们党必须坚定不移的依靠雇农、贫农、乡村工人及一切无地少地的贫民组成贫农团，作为土地改革运动的骨干、基础。但这是不是说，我们可以轻视或者可以稍微轻视团结中农的问题呢？如果把中农排斥在反封建的统一战线之外，能否击破地主、富农及来自其他方面的一切反抗呢？如果没有中农参加，能否把土地改革进行的彻底呢？显而易见，这一切轻视中农的论调，都是不可以的，错误的。因此，我们必须以贫农团为基础联合全体中农组成农会，这是土地改革的反封建的统一战线、联合大军。只有依照这样的阵营，把全体农民组织起来，才能彻底击败地主、富农的反抗，才能彻底完成土地改革的任务。如果我们党不是按照这样的阵营，即，依靠贫农、雇农及一切贫民，组成贫农团；再以贫农团为基础，联合全体中农，组成农会；把农民群众充分发动与团结起来，就不能战胜地主、富农的反抗，就不能把土地改革贯彻到底。同样，群众的发动和斗争，如果不是以贫农、雇农、乡村工人为基础、为骨干、为领导，农民队伍就要犯软骨病，也就不能战胜地主、富农的反抗，也就不能把土地改革贯彻到底。同样，如果雇农、贫农、乡村工人，不去联合全体中农及其他贫民，结成乡村中的广泛的反封建统一战线，来个‘雇佃贫独立运动’，那么就会把自己陷于孤立，也就不能战胜地主、富农的反抗，也就不能把土地改革贯彻到底。所以说，依靠雇农、贫农，联合全体中农，向地主、富农的反抗进行坚决斗争，是我党改革土地制度的一条完整的路线，不容分割”。\n    关于团结中农问题，前年邯郸会议时，曾经指出，一条批准（批准农民土地要求，充分满足无地少地农民的土地要求）是主要的，九条昭顾是附属的，服从于一条批准的。但对中农必须团结，并规定不侵犯中农利益、吸收中农参加斗争及分给中农一定利益，这是正确的。但某些地区在执行中出了毛病，即，不是首先发动贫雇，首先满足贫雇要求，而是抛开贫雇，首先照顾中农，这就错了。我们一定要巩固的团结全体中农，但不要重复过去的错误。一波同志在其总结中指出：“我们必须团结全体中农，但如何认识团结中农这一问题并如何团结中农呢？关键何在呢？关键在于必须首先满足贫农雇农的要求，首先发动贫农雇农。过去有些地区有些同志，对团结中农这一问题认识上有偏差，不是首先发动贫雇，依靠贫雇，去团结中农，没有说明以谁为骨干谁为主体去团结中农，这是没有阶级立场的团结中农论。为着团结中农，它可以损害贫雇利益，可以不发动贫雇，甚至把中农放在领导地位，不是首先照顾贫雇，而是首先照顾中农，这是错误的。但另一方面必须说明，首先照顾贫雇，决不能解释为“雇佃贫独立运动”，不去团结中农，而把中农排斥在反封建统一战线之外。没有与中农的巩固的团结，是不能战胜地主、富农的反抗的。\n    毛主席在目前形势和我们的任务一文中指示我们：“这里必须注意两条基本原则：第一，必须满足贫农与雇农的要求，这是土地改革最基本的任务。第二，必须坚决团结中农，不要损害中农的利益。只要我们掌握了这两条基本原则，我们的土地改革任务就一定能够胜利完成。”毛主席说这是两条基本原则，都叫做“必须”。随后又详细的解释了联合中农的具体政策。他说：“在各地平分土地时，仍须注意中农的意见，如果中农不同意，则应向中农让步。在没收分配封建阶级的土地财产时，应当注意某些中农的需要。在划分阶级成份时，必须注意不要把本来是中农成份的人，错误的将他划到富农圈子里去。在农会委员会中，在政府中，必须吸收中农积极分子参加工作。在土地税及支援战争的负担上，采取公平合理的原则。这些，就是我党在执行巩固的联合中农这一战略任务时所必须采取的具体政策。”毛主席的指示，我们应该好好研究，照着这些原则和政策去作。\n    是否可以提“贫雇路线”呢？可以提的。贫雇路线就是阶级路线，我们应该在每一问题上，都明确阶级观点，一切问题，一切工作都有阶级性，过去我们许多同志就是缺乏阶级观点，因此许多工作犯了错误，其主要致命点就在于不从贫雇观点出发。合作社是给谁办为谁办的？应该明确是为农民首先是为贫雇办的。负担应该怎样摊派？应该公平合理，就是应该照顾农民首先照顾贫雇的负担能力。举凡参军、公粮、战勤、贷款、文化、教育、写通讯稿、办黑板报……都必须有明确的阶级性。有些地方过去提倡过依靠贫雇团结中农，提过贫雇骨干，贫雇带头，这在阶级立场稳定、阶级观点比较明确的同志，能够认识到这是一个立场观点方法的问题，但在许多阶级观点模糊的同志，却常常把他看作只是一个工作方法问题，而不能认识这是与阶级立场阶级观点不能分离的问题。因此，提出贫雇路线有好处。贫雇路线的内容，就是一切要从贫雇利益出发，遇事与贫雇商量，一切要问问贫雇的意见，依靠贫雇，团结中农，战胜地主、富农的反抗。\n    　　　　常化志、陈光同志来信\n    常化志、陈光两同志给本报来信，研究“贫雇路线”问题。除上面已公开答复外，现在将两信摘要发表，以供参考。\n    常化志同志来信摘要：\n    我们今天才收到十二月三十一日的人民日报，我看到报头上的摘语和发表的总结内容中的很重要的一段是这样写的：“土地法大纲总的精神是：依靠雇农贫农乡村工人及一切贫民，打倒地主，平分土地，充分满足雇贫农要求，充分发动雇贫农”（按：是指全区土地会议闭幕消息）。完全没有提到团结中农的问题。我记得二十四号一波同志全区土地会议作总结时，特别谈到依靠雇贫农是否可以不团结中农的问题。他一再指出，依靠贫雇、乡村工人，团结中农及一切反封建分子，是一条完整的不可分割的路线。我记得他讲到土地法大纲总的精神时，也是如上一样，一字不差。我很留心记下。我认为他的总结和毛主席十二月二十五日在中央会议上报告的精神完全一致（即依靠贫雇，巩固地团结中农）。但是为什么人民日报发表的内容又不一样？也许是报馆弄错了？或者其他原因？\n    最近我听了我们一些干部在生产渡荒工作中走贫雇路线的一些汇报。在两三个地方已经发生了以下现象：井陉和赞皇有两个村组织贫雇时，有二百多户，六七百人口的村，结果只组织了三十多个雇贫（他们说是最正牌的贫雇），整个贫雇阶层没有很好发动；井陉河东坡甚至在计算红利时，给中农少算。从这些事实中可以看到我们有些干部在接受一种新的精神时，往往很容易片面。是否正确请指示。\n    常化志一月五日\n    陈光同志来信摘要：\n    读了十二月十二日人民日报二版所载二专指示，题为“贯彻贫雇路线，组织冬季生产”。同版短论又说：“在冬季生产运动中必须贯彻贫雇路线”。我认为这样提法是有毛病的。什么叫“贫雇路线”呢？过去在党的文件上尚未看到过，也未听到过。在发动群众土改运动中也是一贯提“发动贫雇团结中农”，从未提过贫雇路线。在生产运动中更须如此，不团结中农，单贫雇生产，运动是不可能搞起来的。自然扶植贫雇生产作为重点，但扶植重点领导重点是否就叫“贫雇路线”呢？不能这样说。这样提法给下边工作干部什么印象呢？将是一个片面的“贫雇路线”，搞起贫雇就等于一切。对于中农群众什么印象呢？将是“生产上只要贫雇了，不要我们了”。这个片面影响应充分估计。本来就现在认识，生产运动也正如发动土地斗争，应以“依托贫雇团结中农”，开展一个生产互助运动。新华日报提“依托贫雇团结中农”或“组织贫雇带头开展冬季生产”，我认为是比较妥当的。\n    　　陈光十二月十六日"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. A Shanghai newspaper's Beiping dispatch reported on the public trial of a secret agent by students of Beiping Normal College, stating: On November 6th of last year, after the college decided to hold a one-day strike in protest of the murder of martyr Yu Zisan at Zhejiang University, more than 20 KMT secret agent students from China University suddenly stormed into the Normal College in large trucks. Inside the student union, they snatched the list of students who supported the strike and various documents, and beat eight students. As the secret agents were hurriedly getting into the trucks after the attack, one of them was tripped by a stone and captured by Normal College students. A dagger, a KMT party membership card and badge, several secret orders, and payment receipts were found on him. Public outrage was ignited, and he was immediately tied up and put on public trial in the playground, with over a thousand people watching. The secret agent confessed that his name was Yuan Wei, he was from Jinghai, Hebei, and was a third-year law student at China University, as well as an executive committee member of the 24th District Branch of the KMT in Beiping. He stated that he was ordered to come and disrupt the anti-oppression movement and investigate the list of striking students. When asked why he carried a dagger, he said that he always carried a handgun, dagger, and iron ruler with him wherever he went. At this point, the surrounding students were extremely agitated and shouted loudly to beat him. Finally, a unanimous resolution was passed demanding that the KMT publicly apologize to the students, compensate the injured for medical expenses, and guarantee that it would no longer instigate its followers to use bloody means against students.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. According to a Shanghai newspaper report: The Shanghai Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities officially established the so-called \"Flying Fortress\" fascist special police system on November 17th of last year. It is claimed that \"the mission of this organization is to suppress special incidents, conduct surprise inspections (such as hotels, bridge strongholds, etc.), execute emergency orders, patrol important areas, and provide special guard duties.\" This agency was designed by Yu Shuping, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit police chief and secret service leader. Yu openly stated: \"Cases such as street vendor incidents, student unrest, and labor unrest all require such a special organization to suppress them.\" This move shows the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's growing fear of the rising tide of popular resistance.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. Belated news: The International Student Union launched a fundraising campaign in Prague to support students from China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Spain, Greece, and other countries who are struggling for their countries' independence, democracy, and peace. They designated November 11th to 17th of last year as Fundraising Week, and the 17th as \"International Students' Day.\" The fundraising goal was 2 million Czech crowns. In other news: Chinese students in the UK held a representative conference in London in October of last year. At the meeting, in addition to denouncing the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' bloody crimes of massacring students, they unanimously passed a resolution opposing the KMT's fake election in November.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北平师院学生公审蒋党特务　国际学联募款支援我国学生\n\n1948-01-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北平师院学生公审蒋党特务\n  　国际学联募款支援我国学生\n    【新华社陕北十七日电】沪报北平通讯报导北平师范学院学生公审特务情形称：年前十一月六日，该院为抗议浙大于子三烈士被害，决定罢课一天后，忽有中国大学特务学生二十余人乘大卡车闯入师院，在自治会内抢走该校赞成罢课学生名单及各种文稿，并殴伤学生八人。行凶后当各特务正慌忙上车时，其中一人被石头绊倒，为师院学生捕获，当场在身上搜出匕首一把、蒋党党证及党徽各一、密令及领款条数件，群情激愤，当即将其绑至操场公审，围观者千余人。该特务供称：姓元名伟，河北静海人，现为中国大学法律系三年级学生，兼任平市蒋党二十四区分部执行委员。此次系奉命前来破坏反压迫运动及调查罢课学生名单。问他为什么带匕首，他说到什么地方都带上手枪、匕首、铁尺的。此时围观学生情绪沸腾高声喊打。最后一致决议要求蒋党公开向学生道歉，赔偿受伤者医药费，并保证以后不再嗾使其党徒以血腥手段对付学生。\n    【新华社陕北十六日电】据沪报消息：上海蒋匪当局已于去年十一月十七日，正式成立所谓“飞行堡垒”的法西斯特警制。据称：“此项组织之任务，为镇压特殊事件，突击检查（如旅馆、桥梁要隘等等）执行紧急命令，巡视重要地区及特种警卫等”。该机构由蒋匪警察局长特务头目俞叔平所设计。俞公开表示：“象摊贩案件，学潮事件，工潮事件，都需要有这样一个特殊机构来镇压”。此举显示蒋家匪帮对人民反抗怒潮日益高涨之恐惧。\n    【新华社陕北十七日电】迟到消息：国际学联在布拉格发动筹募基金运动，以支援为祖国独立、民主、和平而艰苦奋斗的中国、印尼、越南、西班牙、希腊等国学生，并定年前十一月十一日至十七日为劝募周，十七日为“国际学生日”。募捐目标为捷币二百万元。另讯：中国留英学生年前十月间在伦敦召开代表大会，会上除痛斥蒋匪屠杀学生的血腥罪行外，并一致通过决议，反对蒋党十一月间伪选。"

    "content": "Taihang Winter Production Material Proves\n　　Poor and Lower-Middle Peasant Line Was Not Well Implemented\n    Mainly Due to Leaders Satisfied with the Old Formalistic Approach\n    [Our Newspaper News] This year's winter production in Taihang lasted for nearly three months. The slogan raised in various places was \"Facing the Poor and Hired Peasants,\" following the \"Poor and Hired Peasant Line.\" Now, many places have proven that this poor and hired peasant line is fake. There are mainly three situations:\n\n    The first situation is that the leadership and the cooperative that organizes winter production are controlled by landlords and rich peasants. This is the first stumbling block. In Nanhui Mountain, Lincheng, 240,000 yuan was loaned out, and five households that had been struggled against received 100,000 yuan. In Yitou Village, Lingchuan, ten out of sixteen people in the cooperative were landlords, completely controlled by landlords, directly exploiting the masses. The Su Village cooperative in Pingding used most of its funds to purchase fifty-two spinning wheels, but only eleven were given to the fifty-eight poor and hired peasant households, failing to prioritize meeting the needs of poor and hired peasants. The rest were distributed to middle peasants and above, with seven going to landlords and two to rich peasants. During the inspection of Dongguan, Xiyang, the poor and hired peasants summarized this situation: \"People who are eloquent and capable get things done, resulting in leading some tails (referring to landlords). Leading the poor and hired peasants is also considered difficult.\" This shows that we did not have a clear class viewpoint in the past in winter production, and as a result, landlords infiltrated.\n\n    The second situation is the resistance of cadres: Some cadres are landlords and rich peasants who have infiltrated; some are middle peasants and cannot fully understand the suffering of the poor and hired peasants; some were originally poor and hired peasants, but after turning over and gaining more fruits, they forgot their roots. Therefore, they resist helping the poor and hired peasants with production. The cadres of Gaodian Village, Tunliu, said, \"The leadership told us to follow the poor and hired peasant line. We have been leading the masses to turn over for several years! Isn't it all for the poor? How else should we proceed?\" But an inspection revealed that \"the poor and hired peasants contribute the most labor,\" and \"in the agricultural association's oil mill, the poor peasants only have three shares.\" Some local cadres openly satirized the poor and hired peasants, saying, \"Even if there is a 'thousand-mile horse,' there must be a 'thousand-mile person',\" looking down on the ability of the poor and hired peasants to produce. Li Wusuo, a poor and hired peasant in Anyang Village, Pingshun, fearing that people would say he didn't know how to live, said that he himself was \"cultivating one and having a surplus of one.\" Some even adopted a method of open collapse: \"In Cheshangpu Village, Zuoquan, the cooperative director, group leaders, and shop loans were all pushed to the poor and hired peasants, nominally saying that the poor and hired peasants were in charge, but in reality, the cadres were engaged in production separately.\" \"After a poor and hired peasant in Panlong, Wuxiang, became the mutual aid group leader, he had the title but no power. He said: 'When can I take off this Dragon King robe?'\" The more \"mobilization\" there was, the more isolated and helpless the poor and hired peasants became. In Chitou Village, Lucheng, it was not until the inspection of winter production that the village cadres checked door-to-door, discovered twenty-five poor and hired peasant households, and convened a meeting of poor and hired peasants. Finally, it was decided that the political director would take out 5,000 yuan, the cooperative manager would take out 5,000 yuan and ten shi of surplus grain, and the agricultural association director would also take out 5,000 yuan. Following their \"influence,\" thirteen new middle peasants, twenty-three old middle peasants, and eleven wealthy middle peasants, a total of fifty households, actively \"donated,\" contributing a total of 212,000 yuan. They wanted to use \"charity\" and donating from middle peasants to make up for the poor and hired peasants' deficits. Under these circumstances, the poor and hired peasants had even less opportunity to be in power.\n\n    The third situation is that the leadership is satisfied with the old set of formalistic methods of ideological breakthrough, satisfied with \"bestowing\" temporary economic benefits on the poor and hired peasants, and satisfied with the formalistic change of components, thus producing various distortions of the poor and hired peasant line. In Zhaidian Village, Lucheng, starting from accounting to \"enlighten\" the cadres' concept of the poor and hired peasants, they decided to adopt \"an inspection of one labor and one animal, rather than an inspection of one door and one household.\" The final slogan put forward was: \"Even if you have a thousand gold, don't forget to make a fraction of a cent every day.\" This slogan does not represent the poor and hired peasants, but completely represents the wealthy people's point of view. In the summary of winter production in the first district of Pingshun, it was considered that the new middle peasants benefited more than the old middle peasants, which was a success of the poor and hired peasant line. Whether there were still poor and hired peasants who had not turned over besides the new middle peasants, and whether the poor and hired peasants had truly consciously started production were not mentioned. Mobilizing the poor and hired peasants does not mean \"bestowing\" some benefits to them, but truly letting them consciously participate in the leadership of production organizations. In addition, some places believed that as long as a few poor and hired peasants were placed in the cooperative, the poor and hired peasant line had been followed, and \"great achievements\" had been obtained, without consciously understanding that the poor and hired peasants are the class we rely on, and formalistic transformation alone is not enough.\n\n    The above three situations prove that the \"poor and hired peasant line\" in this year's winter production is fake in many places. Recent materials have exposed that the real difficulties of the poor and hired peasants in many areas have not been resolved. We are only satisfied with a set of formalistic methods from top to bottom, such as \"poor and hired peasants taking the lead\" and \"ideological mobilization,\" without understanding that only when we truly clarify that the poor and hired peasants are the class we rely on, must we resolutely rely on the poor and hired peasants, unite the middle peasants, and completely eliminate the past set of formalistic and substituting practices, can we do a good job in winter production and embark on a truly poor and hired peasant line.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行冬季生产材料证明　贫雇路线没走好  主要是领导上满足旧的形式主义一套\n\n1948-01-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行冬季生产材料证明\n  　贫雇路线没走好\n    主要是领导上满足旧的形式主义一套\n    【本报消息】今年太行各地的冬季生产一共闹了将近三个月，各地方提的口号是“面向雇贫”，走“雇贫路线”，如今有不少地方证明这种雇贫路线是假的，主要有三种情况：\n    第一种情况是领导与组织冬季生产的合作社被地主富农掌握了，这就是第一个绊脚石。临城南辉山贷款二十四万元，五个被斗户就贷了十万元。陵川冶头村合作社十六人中，十人是地主，完全被地主统制，直接剥削群众。平定苏村合作社用大部资金割了五十二辆纺花车，但五十八户雇贫只得了十一辆，根本没有首先满足雇贫要求；其他都发给了中农以上成份，有七架给了地主，两架给了富农。昔阳东关检查中雇贫对这种情况做了个总结：“人家能说会道干了做，结果是带领了一些尾巴（指地主），带领雇贫还嫌费力。”这就说明了我们过去在冬季生产上没有明确的阶级观点，结果地主钻进来了。\n    第二种情况是干部的抵抗：干部中有的是地主富农混进来的；有的是中农成份，不太能理解雇贫的苦；有的虽然原来就是雇贫，翻了身，多得了果实后便忘了本，因此他们是抵抗扶助雇贫生产的。屯留高店村的干部说：“领导上叫我们走雇贫路线呢，我们领导群众翻身几年啦！还不是为了穷人，还该怎样走？”但一检查才发现“支差是雇贫支的多”，“农会里的油坊，贫农只有三股”。有的地方干部公开讽刺雇贫说：“有千里马，还得有千里人”，看不起雇贫能生产。平顺安阳村雇贫李五锁，因为害怕说他不会过，便说他自己“耕一余一”了。有的更采取了公开垮台的办法：“左权车上铺村把合作社长，小组长，店房贷款等都推给雇贫，名义上说让雇贫掌权，实际上干部又另外搞生产。”“武乡蟠龙某雇贫当了互助小组长后，有职无权，他说：什么时候就脱了这个龙王爷袍了。”这样越“发动”，雇贫越孤立，越没办法。潞城赤头村是直到检查冬季生产，村干部才挨门挨户检查，发现了有二十五户雇贫，召开雇贫会，最后决议政治主任拿五千元，合作社经理拿五千元及余粮十石，农会主任也拿出五千元，接着烈属富裕中农拿出一万元；在他们的“影响”下有十三户新中农，二十三户旧中农，十一户富裕中农，共五十户积极“捐款”，共帮助出二十一万二千元。他们想用“恩赐”与捐中农的办法来补雇贫窟窿，在这种情形下，雇贫就更无从当权了。\n    第三种情况是领导上满足于旧的一套形式的打通思想的方法，满足于“恩赐”雇贫一时经济利益，满足于形式上的成份改换，因而便产生了各种各样对雇贫路线的曲解。潞城翟店村，从算帐“启发”干部的雇贫观念，便决定了采取“一劳一畜检查而不是一门一户的检查”。最后提出的口号是：“家有千金不要忘了日进分文。”这种口号不是代表雇贫的，完全代表有钱人的说法。平顺一区在总结冬季生产中认为新中农比旧中农得利多就是雇贫路线有成绩，新中农以外是否还有未翻身雇贫？雇贫是不是真正自觉起来生产均未提到。发动雇贫并不等于“恩赐”给他一些利益，而是真正让他们自觉起来参加生产组织的领导。此外还有的地方认为只要在合作社里按上几个贫雇，便是走了雇贫路线，便“获得很大成绩”，而没有自觉的去了解雇贫是我们要依靠的阶级，仅有形式的改造是不够的。\n    以上三种情况，证明今年冬季生产的“雇贫路线”很多地方是假的，最近的材料暴露了不少地区雇贫的真正困难并未解决，我们只是满足了自上而下的一套形式主义办法，什么“雇贫带头”，“思想发动”，不了解只有我们真正明确了雇贫是我们所依靠的阶级，必须坚决依靠雇贫，团结中农，完完全全取消过去一套形式主义与代替包办的作法，才能搞好冬季生产，走上真正的雇贫路线。"

After farming for two years, I lost nine *shi* of grain (the remaining wages in rice from when he and his brother were hired hands in the past).\" This sentence reveals that his village misused labor tickets, harming the poor. It turns out that Wang Yongzhang did not stand up during the land reform, and now he only farms 18 *mu* of bad land that others didn't want, and lives in a dilapidated cave propped up by pillars. In the summer, he harvested three *shi* and five *dou* of wheat, but because he had broken his leg from herding sheep for the old rich man since he was a child and was unable to perform corvée labor, he was still assigned eight *fen* when labor tickets were distributed to families. Therefore, in addition to his own labor offsetting some corvée, he also paid one *shi* and nine *sheng* of wheat for corvée labor during the months of June, July, and August. In the autumn, he harvested five *shi* of coarse grains. Although the village cadres reduced his land assignment to five *fen*, he still had to pay eight *dou* of rice and three *dou* of corn for corvée labor during the four months of August, September, October, and November, and also one *dou* of teacher's fund grain. When Village Deputy Dong Huaiyu's donkey died, Village Head Li Zengji ordered everyone in the *lu* to \"work together for one person,\" and Wang Yongzhang had to pay another *dou*. As a result, he spent almost all of his remaining grain. However, the landlords in the village were doing very well, farming good land and evading corvée labor. Some landlords took advantage of the loopholes in the organs' production. The landlord Li De lent himself to \"Dashengxin\" to sell livestock, put on the five-pocket organ uniform, flaunted his former airs, and his family was even treated as dependents of cadres, and he was issued 730 *fen* of preferential treatment tickets. Targets of struggle such as Yang Shengzhi, Bai Jinlong, and Tang Jilin also took the opportunity to exploit the loopholes in the armed forces committee cooperative, avoiding corvée labor. Some military dependents who were capable and had labor power were still given preferential treatment. For example, the well-to-do middle peasant Guo Jinfeng's two households had labor power but still received 1355 *fen* of preferential treatment tickets. Wang Yongzhang used more than two *shi* of grain to subsidize these people.

In order to suppress the growing people's armed forces, the Jiang bandits do not hesitate to withdraw two regiments of Guangxi troops from the front to return to Guangxi, and cooperate with the province's security corps and police corps to carry out large-scale massacres of the people, and restore the landlord armed militia organizations of ten years ago. In Guode, Tiandong, Shanglin and other places, the number of innocent people killed cannot be counted. Villages in the Taoxu area of Hengxian have been razed to the ground.

    "date": "1948-01-19",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[Taiyue News] In the fourth district of Jincheng, many villages have harmed the interests of poor and hired peasants and hindered and undermined winter production in the organization of winter production mutual aid. According to Comrade Fu Ting of Jincheng Bank, during a loan work investigation, he found that cadres' \"collectivist\" thinking and control ideology in production were very serious, and private production was not allowed, and it was forced to be collectivized. The result greatly harmed the interests of poor and hired peasants. For example, in Xiaoji Village, Youfangtou Village, etc., private shops were not allowed, and they were all contracted by cooperatives. The small shops opened by five hired poor families were forcibly closed, and the cooperative opened a large shop. Because there were few shops and many customers, the customers were sent to the homes of the people who originally opened small shops for accommodation, and the cooperative would go to collect the shop money the next day. The hired poor farmers angrily said: \"We don't understand what this is called mutual aid.\" When these words reached the ears of the village cadres, they threatened the masses and said: \"This is called selfless devotion to the public, do you want to get rich alone?\" The masses had to swallow their anger and dare not ask any more questions. Dongling Village is a village-wide mutual aid, with more than 50 households in the village. Regardless of each other, all production is put together, including spinning, coal kilns, mills, and transportation. Work is not counted by work points, and there are no wages. All the money earned is collectivized, and dividends are not distributed in time. Middle and poor peasants are not satisfied, and their enthusiasm for production is not high. The middle peasants said: \"We still don't know who we are running for! No matter how hard we work, we don't know how much dividends we will get.\" The poor peasants said: \"We really can't afford it. We have been working all winter and haven't seen a penny.\" Three poor hired laborers in Buluo Village engaged in transportation and earned 120,000 yuan. The cadres said: \"You can share 50,000 yuan, and 70,000 yuan will be collectivized!\" The hired poor had no choice but to follow the cadres' instructions and collectivize 70,000 yuan. The coal kilns, carpentry, and restaurants operated by the Xiaoji Cooperative did not differentiate between skilled workers and apprentices, and were paid four liters of rice per day. Wages were not paid on time. Carpenter Han Fake said: \"If we don't get paid for a day, our whole family will starve. The land is frozen, and we still can't wear cotton-padded clothes.\" The apprentices in the textile factory have already learned how to weave cloth, but they are not paid wages or provided with meals. Hai Zhou's mother said: \"We really can't afford it. Our daughter-in-law is learning to weave cloth, and she doesn't earn a penny every day, and we have to send her food there every day.\" Elsewhere, it costs 800 yuan to spin a catty of cotton, but in Xiaoji it costs 600 yuan. The hired poor farmers said: \"We earn less this way, and the cooperative earns more, but we don't have any shares in the cooperative, and we can't get dividends anyway, so we always suffer.\" Xiaoji sent ten long-term workers away from home in February last year, and they were stopped at home and not allowed to go out. Among them, there were four hired poor, two of whom had nothing to eat at the time, and begged the cadres several times to go out for a trip to earn some money, but the cadres did not allow it. Some cadres were selfish and unwilling to be in production with the hired poor peasants, fearing that they would suffer losses: Geng Changzi, the political director of Zuotang Street, convened a meeting of the masses and shouted to organize mutual aid for production, but after the meeting, he went to transport goods alone. He never asked whether the masses were producing or not. The cadres in Miaoxi Village all went out to produce, but the hired poor peasants sat at home and did nothing because they had no capital. The deputy of Zuojiang Village saw that the coal kiln was not making money, so he forced the masses to dig a coal kiln, but he went to run errands every day. The cadres of Xiaoji Village stipulated that livestock should be handed over to the cooperative for 200 yuan for one day of outside work. A full labor force should pay 100 yuan per day, and a semi-labor force should pay 50 yuan. This greatly reduced the enthusiasm for production. Especially the hired poor farmers who lacked money and livestock, and the money earned by labor was very limited. After deducting 100 yuan a day, they could not earn money and had to lose money, so they did not do it. Old man Guangshun said: \"In other villages, you are punished for not working, but in our village, you are guilty of working.\" Because of this, more than 20 hired poor farmers in the village have not moved since winter production began.\n    The above-mentioned things that lack a class stance have greatly harmed the interests of the hired poor peasants and hindered and undermined winter production. Some villages have corrected some of these issues during the winter loan program, but most of the other villages have not resolved them yet.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋城四区村干包办生产　贫中农都吃大亏\n\n1948-01-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋城四区村干包办生产\n  　贫中农都吃大亏\n    【太岳消息】晋城四区有不少村子在组织冬季生产互助中，伤害了贫雇农的利益，阻碍和破坏了冬季生产。据晋城银行辅廷同志在作贷款工作时的调查，发现干部在生产中的“大公家”思想与统制思想很厉害，一切生产不准私人搞，强迫归公。做的结果大大伤害了贫雇农的利益。如小箕村、油坊头等村，不让私人开店，统归合作社包办。把五家雇贫开的小店强迫关了门，合作社开了一个大店。因为店少客多，就把客人送到原来开小店的人家住宿，第二天合作社再去把店钱收回来。雇贫农气的说：“咱懂不得这叫什么互助。”这些话传到村干部的耳朵里，就吓唬群众说：“这叫大公无私，你想一人发财么？”群众只好忍气吞声，再不敢过问。东岭村是全村大互助，全村五十多户，不分你我把一切生产都搞在一起，有纺织、煤窑、磨坊、运输等，做活不计工，也没有工资。赚下的钱统统归公，也不及时分红。中贫农都不满意，生产情绪不高，中农说：“咱这还不知道给谁跑哩！再费大劲还不知分多大点红利。”贫农说：“咱实在贴不起，动了一冬天没见过一个钱。”不落下村三个贫雇搞运输，赚了十二万元，干部说：“你们分上五万，七万归了公吧！”雇贫没法，只好照干部的吩咐把七万元归了公家。小箕合作社经营的煤窑、木作、饭铺用的工人不分技术工人与学徒，每天都按四升米算。工资又不按时发。木匠韩发科说：“咱一天不发工资，全家人就要饿肚，地都冻了，咱还穿不上棉袄。”纺织厂的学徒已经学会了织布，也不给工资也不管饭。海州的娘说：“咱真赔不起人家，媳妇学织布，每天不赚一个钱，还得天天往那里送饭。”别处纺一斤花工资八百元，小箕纺一斤是六百元。雇贫农说：“这样咱赚的少，合作社赚的多，可是合作社咱又没股金，咱又分不上红，反正咱总是吃亏。”小箕从去年二月就派了十个长差，在家里停着不许出门，里面有四个雇贫，其中两人当下就没吃的，哀求了干部几次要出去跑一趟，赚几个钱，干部都不允许。还有的干部自私自利不愿和雇贫农组在一块生产，怕吃了亏：作堂街政治主任耿长兹召集群众开会高喊组织起来互助生产，会后他可一人去运输走了。群众生产不生产他再也没有问过。庙西村的干部都出去生产了，雇贫因为没本钱坐在家里没动。左匠村副看见煤窑不赚钱，硬逼群众打煤窑，他可是天天去跑买卖。小箕村干部规定每天牲口出外一天，交合作社二百元。人出外全劳力每天交一百元。半劳力交五十元。大大压低了生产情绪。特别是雇贫农缺钱没牲口，凭劳力赚钱很有限，一天抽一百元，赚不了钱还得赔本，所以就不干了。广顺老汉说：“别村都是不劳动受罚，咱村是劳动有罪。”就因为这样，全村有二十多个雇贫农从冬季生产以来就没有动弹。\n    以上这些没有阶级立场的事情，都大大伤害了雇贫农利益，阻碍和破坏了冬季生产。在冬季贷款中有个别村庄纠正了一些，其他大部村子还没有解决。"

Before liberation in the Nanzhao and Nanyang areas, wheat sold for more than 210,000 yuan in Kuomintang currency per斗 (dǒu, a unit of dry measure), but now it only costs 80,000 yuan in Kuomintang currency per斗. In the Biyang and Wuyang areas, cotton has fallen from 38,000 yuan in Kuomintang currency per斤 (jīn, a unit of weight, roughly a pound) to only 28,000 yuan. The prices of other commodities have fallen by 20 to 30 percent. However, in the neighboring Kuomintang-occupied areas, prices are constantly rising. In Zhumadian (reoccupied by the Kuomintang bandits), pork sells for 14,000 yuan in Kuomintang currency per斤, and it is still difficult to buy. But in the liberated areas of Biyang and Fangcheng, it only costs 7,000 yuan in Kuomintang currency per斤. In the heartland of the Liberated Area, the exchange rate of Jicha (Hebei-Chahar) currency to Kuomintang currency has also increased from 1:10 to 1:20.

After the liberation of Qianjiang City, poor farmers from villages within thirty to forty miles around, regardless of gender, formed teams to go to the city to distribute grain, and the line of people carrying grain stretched for more than ten miles. After the liberation of Jingshan, the masses distributed grain for two days and two nights. In Zhongxiang, when the People's Liberation Army attacked the city, more than a thousand poor farmers gathered at the newly opened Southeast Gate waiting to distribute grain. After the complete liberation of Tianmen, the masses poured into the enemy's warehouses, banks, and county government offices to distribute grain amidst sporadic gunfire. Finally, the number of people participating in the grain distribution increased to more than 10,000, and all the grain plundered by the Jiang bandits was distributed in one day. The stretcher team organized by the masses in the county carried pockets with them, in preparation for distributing grain and returning home after completing their tasks. According to preliminary statistics, the above four county towns distributed more than 15,000 shi of grain within ten days, and tens of thousands of poor farmers received food.

Red Star newspaper said: The civil war launched by the Kuomintang reactionaries with the support of American imperialism, and the American policy of colonizing China, not only prevented the Chinese people from revitalizing their national economy, but also became the main factor in destroying the Chinese economy.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Guangzhou Dispatch: Since the American running dog Song Ziwen was appointed as the Chairman of Guangdong Province by the Chiang gang, he has been trying his best to turn South China into a base for American aggression against China. The American aggressive forces in South China have therefore greatly expanded. Song Ziwen arrived in Guangzhou on September 30th last year, and on October 2nd, Rockefeller III, the American oil magnate, came to Guangdong to discuss with Song the development of Guangdong's mineral resources and power construction, and reached an \"agreement.\" On October 13th, the vice president of the American Penney Company also discussed with Song the investment in Guangdong's industry and commerce, and immediately decided to use the latest American machinery to mine coal in northern Guangdong, and obtained the right to build roads and ports in Guangdong. On October 15th, Jibodi, a counselor of the American Embassy, came to Guangdong to exchange opinions with Song on South China business. American businessmen have raised $150 million to set up various manufacturing plants in Guangzhou. Chennault's airline has decided to relocate its headquarters to Guangzhou, and announced the successful test flight to Hainan Island on October 27th. On October 29th, Perry, manager of American Southwest Steel Company, openly stated that he would soon establish a steel plant on Hainan Island. In late October, Ke Wendong, the military attaché of the US Embassy, ​​at the invitation of Song Ziwen, came to Guangdong to formulate a military plan for Song. In mid-November, Kirk, commander of the US Southwest Pacific Fleet, met with Song Ziwen in Guangdong, discussing the construction of ports in Huangpu and Yulin Port on Hainan Island.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: The first batch of four trade representatives of the Chiang gang to Japan departed for Japan on the 15th, and more representatives will continue to go there. The Chiang gang government's announcement of opening up trade with Japan is in accordance with the regulations of the US military headquarters stationed in Japan. This move has further made the Chiang area a raw material supply base for Japan. The Chiang gang government clearly stipulates that the task of the \"trade representatives\" to Japan is to exchange raw materials from the Chiang area for Japanese equipment needed for the Chiang gang's civil war, and the \"representatives\" are agents for dumping Japanese goods in China. The Chiang gang has transported a large amount of raw materials to Japan to supply Japanese industry and to benefit the four major families.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美走狗宋子文卖国　华南已成美侵略基地\n\n1948-01-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美走狗宋子文卖国\n  　华南已成美侵略基地\n    【新华社陕北十六日电】莫斯科讯：红星报十四日评称：中国战后经济的特点是：危机加深和日益倚赖美国。红星报说：在美帝国主义支持下国民党反动派发动的内战，以及美国殖民地化中国的政策，不仅阻止中国人民复兴他们的国民经济，而且是摧毁中国经济的主要因素。\n    【新华社陕北十五日电】广州通讯：美国走狗宋子文被任为蒋匪广东省主席以后，即竭力变华南为美国侵华基地。美国在华南之侵略势力因之大为扩张。宋子文去年九月三十日到广州，十月二日美国煤油大王洛克菲勒第三即来粤，与宋商谈广东矿藏开发及电力建设问题，并取得“协议”。十月十三日美国潘尼公司副总裁又与宋商洽投资粤省工商业问题，随即决定以美国最新机械开采粤北煤矿，并获得了广东的筑路和筑港权。十月十五日美国大使馆参赞纪柏狄，又来粤与宋广泛交换对华南商务意见。美商已集资一亿五千万美元在广州筹设各种制造厂。陈纳德空运公司已决定将总站改设广州，并于十月二十七日宣告海南岛试航成功。十月二十九日美国西南钢铁公司经理柏里希公开表示即将到海南岛设立钢铁厂。十月下旬美大使馆武官柯·文董应宋子文邀请，到粤为宋制订军事计划。十一月中旬美西南太平洋舰队司令柯克到粤晤宋子文，即系与宋商讨黄埔及海南岛榆林港建港问题。\n    【新华社陕北十七日电】蒋匪首批赴日贸易代表四人，已于十五日启程赴日，更多代表即将连续前往。蒋匪政府宣布开放对日贸易，系按照驻日美军总部规定，此举已使蒋区进一步成为日本的原料供应地。蒋匪政府明白规定赴日“贸易代表”的任务，是以蒋区原料换取蒋匪内战所需要之日本器材，而各“代表”则为日货向华倾销的代理人。蒋匪已将大量原料输日，以供应日本工业，并为四大家族谋利。"

Commanders of a certain unit of the Northeast People's Liberation Army summoned Liu Guangtian (formerly misidentified as Miao Guangtian), commander of the enemy's 43rd Division, and Yi Xiyin, the division's chief of staff, and others who laid down their arms in the great victory at Gongzhutun, at their residence on the 9th. Liu Guangtian described the embarrassing situation when he was captured, saying: On the morning of the 7th, when the People's Liberation Army fiercely bombarded Wenjiatai, their command post was immediately thrown into chaos, and contact with the military headquarters (the enemy's New Fifth Army), which was in the same village, was immediately cut off. The military headquarters did not want the division, and the division did not look for the military headquarters; each was panic-stricken and only cared about escaping. When the People's Liberation Army attacked the village, he once thought of using valuables to bribe the People's Liberation Army soldiers to let him go, but the soldiers sternly refused, but they did not insult him in the slightest. He and Yi Xiyin were very grateful for the leniency of the People's Liberation Army. Speaking of the future of the civil war, both Liu and Yi said that they had long lost confidence. They also said: The Chinese people are against Chiang Kai-shek's selling out the country and engaging in civil war. We have also witnessed the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas suffering from hunger and cold, and anti-Chiang struggles are springing up everywhere. This alone shows that Chiang Kai-shek is destined to fail.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 17th. Xie Daizheng, the major general division commander of the Chiang bandits' so-called \"important mobile force,\" the 195th Division, quickly admitted his name and position after being captured. At first, he was commanding operations in Dongbian Jiuhuang. After a fierce attack by the People's Liberation Army, two battalions of a bandit army regiment were defeated. Seeing that the situation was not good, he hurriedly fled to Jiutun. However, the next day, the People's Liberation Army advanced again, and he, without bandaging his wounded left arm, hurriedly handed over the division's direct units to the deputy division commander, and he fled to Wenjiatai again. Before he had time to rest, the People's Liberation Army surrounded the village again the next morning, and the artillery fire was as dense as a string of pearls, making it impossible for him to move an inch. He had no choice but to squat in a bunker to hide, and finally became a prisoner. He had long been familiar with the lenient policy of the People's Liberation Army. He cited the examples of Li Zhengyi, the former commander of the Kuomintang's 25th Division, and Duan Peide, the commander of the 20th Division, saying, \"I am a colleague of theirs, and I know a lot about their situation after being captured.\" When reporters asked him why he was still blindly bragging seven days before being captured, saying, \"This offensive by the Communist bandits is no different than a moth flying into a flame\"? He hurriedly shirked responsibility, saying that the \"Appeal to Officers and Soldiers\" was written by a major staff officer.

Chiang's secret agents have arrested more than 200 merchants on the 9th and 10th, confiscating hundreds of billions of yuan in gold and US dollars. However, they still cannot control the Shanghai market. As of the 10th, the price of rice had reached 1.6 million yuan per stone, and rice merchants were only selling to regular customers. Black market merchants dealing in US dollars and gold have all gone underground. Most merchants refuse to sell goods, saying: Gold, currency, and prices will rise even more sharply before the Lunar New Year.

Since the Chiang government announced the issuance of large banknotes on the 9th of last month, the price surge has rapidly spread to major cities in all Chiang-controlled areas. In addition to Shanghai, Tianjin, the economic center of the Chiang bandits in North China, also experienced market chaos after the news of the banknote issuance.

On the 7th of last month, two Japanese fishing boats were discovered in the Zhejiang sea area, and on the 27th, another ten Japanese fishing boats were discovered.\n   \nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Shanghai newspaper news: \"UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA)\" colludes with Chiang Kai-shek bandits to continue large-scale fishing in the Chinese coastal waters. At the beginning of last month, eight \"UNRRA\" fishing boats fully loaded with fresh fish were transported to Shanghai for dumping. Taiwan, Ningbo, Wenzhou and other places also frequently have \"UNRRA\" fishing boats transporting fish for sale. The United States, through \"UNRRA,\" is invading and endangering China's private fishing industry, which has aroused public outrage in the Chinese fishing industry. At the beginning of last month, Shanghai fish merchants launched a boycott movement, forcing five of the eight \"UNRRA\" fishing boats to be unable to unload their cargo. UNRRA personnel said: These 120,000 dan of fish can only be used as fertilizer.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋贼出卖我国海面美日渔船侵入打鱼　上海鱼商发动抵制运动\n\n1948-01-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋贼出卖我国海面美日渔船侵入打鱼\n  　上海鱼商发动抵制运动\n    【新华社陕北十六日电】上海消息：在蒋匪政府默许下，日本渔船两艘侵入浙江海面，其中一艘名“德洋丸”两船载重量皆在百吨以上，并驶至距浙江沿岸海礁三海里处捕鱼。按日本渔船侵华活动，系美蒋勾结纵容下有计划之行为，上月七日浙江海面即已发现日本渔船二艘，二十七日又续发现日本渔轮十艘。\n    【新华社陕北十七日电】沪报消息：“联总”与蒋匪勾结，继续在中国沿海进行大规模捕鱼。上月初即有“联总”满装鲜鱼之八艘渔轮运沪倾销。台湾、宁波、温州等地亦经常有“联总”渔轮运往销售。美国通过“联总”侵略、危害中国民营渔业，已激起中国渔业界公愤。上月初沪市鱼商曾发动抵制运动，迫使“总联”八艘渔船中有五艘不能卸货。行总人员说：这十二万担鱼，只能当肥料用了。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Ji Cha Re Liao, 14th: Under the influence of the continuous victories of the People's Liberation Army's winter offensive, the Chiang bandits in Jinzhou are extremely panicked. The general public, on the other hand, are eager for the People's Liberation Army to rescue them as soon as possible. Recently, the Chiang bandits only dare to patrol ten or eight li outside the city during the day, and shrink back into the city at night. The landlords and local bullies in the countryside are in a state of constant anxiety, and they have fled into the city one after another. Not only is the atmosphere in the city tense, with several scares a day, but also prices are soaring and miscellaneous taxes are heavy. In mid-last month, sorghum rice rose from 50,000 to 80,000 Chiang bandit's circulating currency per dou, and coal rose to 300 yuan per jin. The heavy miscellaneous taxes can be illustrated by the case of a poor household of three in Beiguan, who have no land or property: in October of last year, the household was forced to pay 1,500 yuan for consolation fees, 25,000 yuan for city defense fees, and 1,000 yuan for the district office's operating expenses. Han Bin, the principal of the municipal senior primary school, cannot afford to eat with his monthly salary and has to make a living by selling scraps in his spare time. A tragedy occurred in Beiguan where a poor household of five hanged themselves because they were driven to a dead end by the Chiang bandits' debt collection. In order to survive, more than 20,000 poor people in the city gathered together and robbed both the Beidoukou and the city's two grain markets. While robbing, they shouted: \"If we don't rob grain, we will starve to death. The common people cannot survive in the areas occupied by the Central Government (Chiang bandits)!\" The citizens, living in dire straits, are looking forward to the People's Liberation Army entering the city day and night. The people who were forced to repair the city moat said, \"This is digging a grave for the Central Army (Chiang bandits).\" They hate Chiang Kai-shek and call Chiang Kai-shek's \"birthday fee\" a funeral fee. The Chiang bandit soldiers guarding the city said, \"We will hand over our guns when the Eighth Route Army comes!\" The currency of our democratic government in Rehe Province enjoys extremely high credit among the people in the Chiang area. In the past, the exchange rate with the Chiang bandit's circulating currency was one to one, but by the 15th of last month, it had risen to one to five. People holding Chiang currency in Nuanchitang, Hongluoxian, Gaoqiao and other places have converted it into the democratic government's banknotes for safekeeping.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 锦州城内人民热望我军搭救他们\n\n1948-01-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　锦州城内人民热望我军搭救他们\n    【新华社冀察热辽十四日电】解放军冬季攻势连续胜利影响下，锦州蒋匪慌张异常。一般市民则都渴望解放军快些搭救他们。近来蒋匪白天放哨仅敢出城十里八里，晚间即龟缩城中。四乡地主恶霸惶惶不可终日，纷纷逃入城内。而城内不仅风声鹤唳，一日数惊，且又物价狂涨，苛杂繁重。上月中旬，高粱米每斗由蒋匪流通券五万元涨到八万元，煤涨至每斤三百元。苛杂繁重可引北关一家房地全无的三口人的穷户为例：年前十月份该户被迫交慰劳费一千五百元、城防费二万五千元、区公所办公费一千元。市立高小校长韩滨月薪不够吃饭，只好靠课余卖破烂维生。北关曾发生一家五口穷户被蒋匪催逼走头无路上吊自杀的惨剧。为求生存全市二万多贫民曾集合起来将北斗口及市内两粮市一起抢光，他们一面抢一面高喊：“不抢粮咱们就得饿死，中央（蒋匪）占的地方老百姓活不成了！”市民在水深火热中日夜盼望着人民解放军进城。被迫修城壕的人民说：“这是给中央军（蒋匪）挖坟墓”。他们痛恨蒋介石，把蒋介石的“寿日费”称为送丧费。守城的蒋匪士兵则说“八路军来了我们就交枪！”我民主政府的热河省钞，在蒋区人民中信用极高，过去与蒋匪流通券兑换率为一比一，到上月十五已涨到一比五。暖池塘、虹螺岘、高桥等地持有蒋币人民，纷纷将之兑换成民主政府钞票保藏。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-19",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 16th. Our correspondents report that the KMT bandits trapped in the isolated cities of Jilin and Changchun are short of food, coal, and electricity, and are approaching a dead end. As early as when the People's Liberation Army's autumn offensive began last year, the defending enemies in Changchun had already lost the only Jilin-Changchun Railway and the Xiaofengman high-voltage power lines. The puppet organizations that they had prepared to seize autumn grain from the countryside were also wiped out by our counter-attacking army. The KMT bandit troops guarding the city can only fill their stomachs with thin porridge. The doors, windows, boxes, cabinets, farm implements, and nearby trees of the residents in Erdaohaozi and other places have been chopped down by the bandit troops for building bunkers and cooking. As soon as winter began, the bandit soldiers secretly dismantled the newly built bunker wood to burn for warmth. There is no electricity or running water in the city. Only a few high-ranking KMT military officers monopolize the small amount of electricity from the thermal power generators. By the beginning of November, when the coal reserves were exhausted, even this pitiful power source was gone. The KMT bandit troops were forced to defend this isolated city in darkness.\n\nThe KMT bandits' supply difficulties have reached the extreme. The New 1st Army, which was once known as the \"Sons of Heaven,\" only has cotton trousers that reach their calves this winter, and half of their hands are exposed from their sleeves. Each person only receives a bowl of sorghum rice a day, mixed with half soybeans. The vegetable allowance of \"circulating coupons\" is 220 yuan (equivalent to 2,200 KMT currency), which is not even enough to boil water. Dismantling houses has become a money-making avenue for the bandit troops. Hongxi Street near the Higher Court, the buildings at the airport, and the residential areas of the puppet Manchukuo officials formerly known as \"South New Capital\" are now a scene of rubble. The bandit officers even forced soldiers to collect civilian carts, dismantle them into wood, and sell them on the market. The only way out for the hungry and cold people in the isolated city is to ignore the bandit troops' ban and escape to the liberated areas through the strict KMT military cordon lines. The bandit troops are also surrendering to us one after another, with more than twenty or thirty people every day. On the Jilin-Changchun line controlled by the liberated areas, this kind of fleeing crowd and surrendering KMT soldiers are constantly appearing.\n\nAnother isolated city, Jilin, saw the bandit leader and provincial chairman Liang Huasheng, who also happened to be a major grain merchant, take the opportunity to hoard grain during the People's Liberation Army's autumn offensive. Rice prices soared, and the bandit soldiers could not eat their fill. For example, soldiers of the 22nd Division ate only two meals of thin porridge a day, and new recruits were only given some bean dregs to fill their stomachs. The mountains and forests of Xiaofengman were occupied and felled by the 60th Army, so the price of firewood also rose sharply. Slippery wood firewood was sold for 500 or 600 yuan per catty. Sorghum rice and mixed noodles have become recognized luxuries, and bean cakes are even sold by the catty. One thousand yuan can only buy a small tube of bean dregs. Under these circumstances of exorbitant prices, people have no way to make a living, and dozens of people die of starvation in the city every day. Many citizens flock to the gate of the KMT provincial government to beg for food, and rice-snatching riots have already occurred. The bandit troops attempted to grab grain from the liberated areas, but were repelled by the local people's armed forces only thirty miles outside the city.\n\nThe KMT bandits, who have run out of options in the encirclement of the People's Liberation Army, are in a state of panic day and night. A curfew is imposed after dusk, and gunfire echoes throughout the city all night. Passwords are changed seven or eight times every night. The morale of the KMT army is low, and a mood of homesickness and war-weariness prevails. Following the mutiny of eight soldiers from the 60th Army's direct manpower transportation team on December 13th, who killed their platoon deputy and deserted with their guns, five soldiers from the Jilin Assault Team also defected to the People's Liberation Army with a heavy machine gun. By mid-December, 40 soldiers from the KMT 60th Army had surrendered to our Eastern Manchuria Liberation Regiment. The Second Regiment of the Provisional 52nd Division had dwindled from 1,700 men to only 500. The desertion of the KMT New 1st Army is also increasing day by day. In the month of December last year, the Fourth Company of the 99th Regiment of the New 30th Division under the jurisdiction of the army had more than 40 deserters in just half a month. Although the KMT military officers used the cruel punishment of burying deserters alive to suppress them, it was still ineffective. The soldiers all said, \"The more you kill, the more we will escape. Anyway, we can't freeze or starve to death with you.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. According to a Shanghai dispatch from foreign news agencies on the 13th: The Chennault Air Transport Team, established by American imperialists to assist Chiang in smuggling and waging the civil war, recently received an \"urgent notice\" requiring the team to be responsible for airlifting military supplies from Beiping to Shenyang. The team will also sign a contract with the KMT bandits to transport 7,000 civil servants from Shenyang for evacuation. It is reported that when Fu Zuoyi left Shenyang this time, the plane he was on was crowded with people trying to escape the city, but except for Fu's close cronies, the rest were expelled. The panic of the bandits in the city can be seen from this.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 长春吉林已成死城　市内粮煤电水都缺　居民蒋军大批逃亡\n\n1948-01-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　长春吉林已成死城\n  　市内粮煤电水都缺\n  　居民蒋军大批逃亡\n    【新华社东北十六日电】总分社记者报导吉、长蒋匪困守孤城缺粮缺煤缺电，已临日暮途穷的窘境称：早在去年解放军秋季攻势开始时，长春守敌即已失掉仅有的吉长铁路、和小丰满高压电线路，其准备用以抢夺秋粮的回乡伪组织，也被我反攻大军一扫而光。守城蒋匪军只能以稀粥充饥。二道河子等地民家门窗、箱柜、农具和该地附近的树木，都被匪军砍光，作为修地堡、煮饭之用，冬天刚开始，匪兵已将新修好的地堡的木料偷偷拆去烤火。市内没有电和自来水，只有匪军少数高级官员独占着火力发电机的少数电力。到十一月初存煤用完，就连这可怜的电源也没有了，蒋匪军便在黑暗中死守着这座孤城。\n    蒋匪补给之困难达于极点，素称“天之骄子”的新一军，今冬棉裤只到腿肚子，两袖露出半截手。每人每天伙食只发一碗高粱米，里面还掺一半大豆，菜金“流通券”二百二十元（合蒋币二千二百元）连烧开水也不够。拆房子成了匪军的生财大道，高等法院附近的洪熙街和飞机场的建筑，及过去称为“南新京”的伪满官吏住宅区，现在都变成一片瓦砾场。匪军官们更强迫士兵征集民间大车，拿来拆成木料在市上出卖。孤城中饥寒交迫的老百姓唯一出路，就是不顾匪军禁令，通过森严的匪军警戒线，逃到解放区来，匪军也纷纷向我投诚，每天都在二三十人以上。在解放区控制的吉长线上，不断的出现着这种逃难的人群与投诚的蒋军。\n    另一孤城吉林，在去年解放军秋季攻势期中，身兼大粮商的匪首省主席梁华盛，即乘机大囤粮食，米价大涨，匪军士兵则不得饱食，如二十二师士兵日食两顿稀粥，新兵只发给若干豆渣填肚子。小丰满的山林被匪六十军霸占砍伐，因而柴价也大涨，滑木柴每斤卖到五、六百元，高粱米和杂面成了公认的奢侈品，豆饼也竟论斤买卖，一千元只能买到一小筒豆渣。在此米珠薪桂下，人民无以为生，市内饿死的人每日就有数十人。许多市民拥到蒋匪省府门前要饭，并已发生抢米风潮。匪军曾企图向解放区抢粮，但仅出城三十里就被人民地方武装击退。\n    在解放军包围中走头无路的蒋匪，惊慌不可终日，黄昏后即行戒严，市内枪声彻夜不绝，口令每夜更换七、八次。蒋军士气低落，普遍弥漫着思家厌战情绪。继年前十二月十三日匪六十军军直人力输送团八个士兵杀死排副拖枪起义之后，吉林突击队又有五名士兵，携重机枪一挺向解放军投诚。十二月中蒋匪六十军投诚的士兵达到我东满解放团的就有四十人，其暂五十二师第二团，已由一千七百人跑得只剩了五百人。蒋匪新一军的逃亡，也日益增加，仅该军所辖新三十师九十九团第四连，于去年十二月份半个月内，即曾逃亡四十余人。匪军军官们虽以活埋逃兵的酷刑来镇压，仍毫无效果，士兵们都说：“你们越杀，咱越逃，反正不能跟你们冻死饿死”。\n    【新华社陕北十五日电】据外国通讯社十三日沪讯：美帝国主义者为助蒋内战进行走私而设之陈纳德空运大队日前接到“紧急通知”，要该队负责自北平空运军用物资至沈，该队并将与蒋匪订立自沈阳载运七千公务员撤退的合同。据悉：傅作义此次离沈时，其所乘飞机即为企图逃离该城的人所挤满，但除傅匪亲信爪牙外，余均被逐，该市匪帮之惶惧，由此可见一般。"

Recently, the Roxas reactionary government has once again deployed troops, vowing to \"crush the people's armed forces in the provinces of Bulacan and Quezon.\" However, according to news from the 8th, the Philippine people's guerrilla warfare is vigorously developing in the aforementioned areas. In the town of Bokou, only 31 kilometers from Manila, an unprecedented fierce battle recently took place. More than 50 well-equipped soldiers of the People's Liberation Army (part of the People's Liberation Army based in the Sierra Madre Mountains) attacked a position held by 200 Roxas troops, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Taruc, leader of the Philippine People's Liberation Army, issued a statement on the 12th, rejecting the Roxas bandits' \"unconditional surrender\" ultimatum and severely condemning the traitorous crimes of the Philippine traitor Roxas, stating: \"The People's Liberation Army will never surrender. We have not committed any crimes. We are fighting for an independent, democratic, and peaceful life. Why should we surrender? Only those who have committed crimes against the people should surrender!\" He called on the Philippine people to persist in the patriotic war of self-defense. It is reported that Taruc is one of the founders of the Philippine People's Liberation Army (formerly the People's Anti-Japanese Army) and also one of the leaders of the Philippine Communist Party. He is only 34 years old this year. When the Japanese bandits surrendered, he refused the reactionary order of American imperialism to disarm the People's Anti-Japanese Army, and led his troops in the provinces of Pampanga, Bulacan, and Nueva Ecija in central Luzon to launch the struggle against the United States and Roxas, establish a democratic regime, and carry out land reform. In this area, 98% of the land was concentrated in the hands of a very small number of landlords, and it has now been distributed to the peasants. In the liberated areas under Taruc's command, the broad masses of peasants are rising up to join the army and participate in the war.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 为独立民主和平而战　菲人民解放军壮大  布拉干等省实行土地改革\n\n1948-01-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　为独立民主和平而战\n  　菲人民解放军壮大\n    布拉干等省实行土地改革\n    【新华社陕北十七日电】马尼拉讯：菲律宾共产党领导下的人民解放军，在不断攻击敌人的战斗中壮大，使美帝国主义走狗菲奸罗哈斯大为惊慌。最近罗哈斯反动政府又调兵遣将，扬言要“粉碎布拉干与奎松两省”的人民武装。但据八日消息，菲律宾人民游击战争，正在上述区域蓬勃开展，距马尼拉仅三十一公里之波沟镇，近曾发生空前激战，五十余名配备优良之人民解放军（系锡拉马德利山区根据地人民解放军的一部分），曾袭击驻有二百名罗哈斯军的阵地，予敌重大伤亡。菲律宾人民解放军领袖塔拉克十二日发表谈话，他拒斥罗匪“无条件投降”之通牒，并痛责菲奸罗哈斯之叛国罪行称：“人民解放军决不投降。我们并未犯罪，我们为争取独立、民主、和平的生活而战，我们为什么应该投降呢？只有那些犯有反人民之罪的人才应该投降！”他号召菲律宾人民坚持爱国自卫战争。按塔拉克系菲律宾人民解放军（其前身即人民抗日军）创始人之一，亦为菲共领袖之一，今年才三十四岁。日寇投降时，他拒绝美帝国主义解除人民抗日军武装的反动命令，率部在吕宋中部之巴邦加、布拉干、爱西加诸省发动反美反罗哈斯之斗争，建立民主政权并进行土地改革，该区集中于极少数地主手里的土地达百分之九十八，现已分配给农民。在塔拉克所部解放地区，广大农民正奋起参军参战。"

    "content": "Landlords Live Well with Good Land, Poor Laborers Lack Land and Go Hungry\n  　Incomplete Land Reform in Beizhaolin Village, Qi County\n    [Jinan News] Land reform in Beizhaolin Village, Qi County, is far from complete. Landlords still have good houses, good land, and a good life, while poor peasants lack houses and land and still go hungry. During the democratic struggle in the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), this village was not mobilized. In the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), a \"laborer and poor peasant movement\" was launched, weakening the landlords and rich peasants somewhat. Last year's major movement was still very incomplete. The village has a total of 350 households, with 38 landlord households, but only 20 were struggled against. There were 36 rich peasant households, but only 15 had their tails cut off, and half of those were not thoroughly struggled against. All of them retained a life above the middle peasant level, with each person averaging more than four mu of land. For example, Cheng Degui, Feng Laocu, and Xu Gui each still average seven mu of land; the households that were struggled against still live in many good houses. Yu Laode and Zhang Jingchun, both with eight people in their families, still have 20 tile-roofed houses. Yu Tingyuan and Yu Tingjie still have their original tile-roofed houses. Xu Huai still has a courtyard with two entrances. Qiao Rizhang's house was struggled out, and some people advocated demolishing it, but he took money and bought back part of it at a low price. The lives of the landlords have not changed at all after being struggled against. For example, Qiao Rizhang, Qiao Risheng, Cheng Degui, Zhang Jingchun, Xu Gui, Ma Shuming, and others still raise cattle. Xu Dexue and Xu Jinhai eat and dress even better after being struggled against than before. Only two households out of the more than 30 that were struggled against produced silver dollars, and no underground treasures were unearthed. The Yu family landlords in this village have been wealthy since the Ming Dynasty, and they still live in good houses. The floating wealth that was struggled out was very light, and the underground treasures were not even investigated. When the struggle was going on, Yu Tingzuo ran away. Afterwards, he rode around on a bicycle, dressed lavishly, swaggering down the street, saying that he was in a public hospital and that he and the chief of the Public Security Bureau, Ma Fanglin, were sworn brothers, in order to scare the masses. Therefore, other landlords who had been struggled against also raised their heads greatly. Twenty-nine landlord and rich peasant households that escaped the net (they now have 39 households after dividing their families), with a total of 209 people, still have 1,200 mu of good land, averaging six mu per person, and all raise cattle. Xu Jinxiang raises two large cattle, Dang Quanfu raises one and a half, and Yu Jinglian raises a large mule. Each person averages two rooms. Zhang Jinxiu, with a family of eight, still has 24 rooms and more than 40 mu of good land. Feng Tingkui and Dang Mingfeng each still average eight mu of good land. The landlord feudal forces in this village still occupy an advantage in the economy. Before the movement, the 130 poor peasant households in the village had a total of 1,172.5 mu of land, which increased to 1,902 mu after the movement. Last year's major movement struggled out a total of 1,414 mu of land, and the poor peasant class was divided a total of 730 mu. The poor peasants, a total of 468 people, now average slightly more than four mu per person. The poor peasants now have a total of 523 houses (including 109 newly built), and the village struggled out a total of 182 houses (161 were demolished). Including the new mud houses built by the poor peasants this year, each person averages slightly more than one room. Sixty-nine households in the village are immediately requesting a solution to the housing problem. This year, all the poor peasants harvested a total of 155,850 jin of grain. After paying 23,000 jin of public grain, 50 households will not receive grain this spring. Last year's major movement struggled out a total of 34,000 jin of grain, and the poor peasants were only divided 13,000 jin. A total of 20 cattle and 8 mules were struggled out, and the poor peasants only received 15 cattle. A total of 21 carts were struggled out, and the poor peasants only received 4. A total of 50 pieces of plows, harrows, drills, etc., were struggled out, and the poor peasants only received 15 pieces. Now, the 130 poor peasant households have a total of 31 cattle, 23 plows, 17 harrows, 14 drills, and 6 carts.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 地主好地好生活贫雇缺地还挨饿　企之北召林土地改革不彻底\n\n1948-01-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　地主好地好生活贫雇缺地还挨饿\n  　企之北召林土地改革不彻底\n    【冀南消息】企之北召林村土地改革还差的很远，地主还是好房好地好生活，贫农是缺房少地还挨饿。民国三十四年民主斗争时，这村没有发动。三十五年开展了“雇佃贫运动”，把地主富农削弱了一下。去年大动还是很不彻底。全村共三百五十户，有地主三十八户，只斗了二十户。富农三十六户，只割了十五户尾巴，并且有一半斗的很不彻底，全部都留了中农以上生活，每人都平均四亩地以上。如程德贵、冯老粗、徐贵每人还平均七亩地；被斗户还住着很多好房。于老德、张景春都是八口人，都还有二十间瓦房。于廷元、于廷杰还是原来的瓦房。徐怀还是一进二的院子。乔日章的房子斗出了，有人主张拆，他又拿钱低价换回一部分。地主被斗后，生活根本没变。如乔日章、乔日省、程德贵、张景春、徐贵、马书明等都还喂着牛，徐德学、徐金海斗后比斗前吃穿还好。全村斗了三十多户，只有两户斗出银元，地下宝全没搞出来。这村于家地主从明朝就是财主，还住着好房，浮财斗的也很轻，地下宝更没有问。斗争时于廷佐跑了，事后骑着车子，穿的阔阔的，在街上大摇大摆，说他在公家医院，和什么公安局长麻芳林是换贴来吓唬群众。因此别的被斗地主也大大抬头。漏网地主富农廿九户（他们现下分家计卅九户），共二百零九人，还有好地一千二百亩，每人平均六亩，都喂着牛。徐金镶喂着两头大牛，党全福喂着个半，于敬连喂着大骡，每人平均房子两间。张尽修八口人，还有房子二十四间，有好地四十多亩。冯廷奎、党明凤每人还平均好地八亩。这村地主封建势力在经济上还占着优势。全村一百三十户贫农，运动前共有地一千一百七十二亩五分，运动后增到一千九百零二亩。去年大动共斗出地一千四百一十四亩，贫农阶层共分了七百三十亩。贫农共四百六十八人，每人现在平均四亩稍多。现在贫农共有房子五百二十三间（内新盖一百零九间），全村共斗出一百八十二间房，（拆了一百六十一间），连贫农今年新盖土房子，每人平均一间稍多。全村马上要求解决房子问题的有六十九户。全体贫农今年共收粮食一五五八五○斤，除缴公粮二三○○○斤外，有五十户接不到今年春天。去年大动共斗出粮食三四○○○斤，贫农只分了一三○○○斤。共斗出牛二十头、骡八头，贫农只分到牛十五头。共斗出大车二十一辆，贫农只分到四辆。共斗出犁、耙、耧等五十件，贫农只分到十五件。现在一百三十户贫农，共有牛三十一头，犁二十三件，耙十七件，耧十四件，大车六辆。"

This conference primarily addressed the issue of how to help our peasants divide the land and achieve liberation. At this meeting, nine representatives were elected to form a preparatory committee for the Border Region Peasants' Association. This is because in the future, our villages, districts, and counties will establish peasant representative conferences, and all the peasants in the Border Region will be organized together to establish a region-wide peasant representative conference. This matter is not simple. Our Border Region is vast, and no one knows everyone. To organize a large conference, we must elect people who truly work for the peasants to prepare for it. This is the origin of the Border Region Peasants' Association Preparatory Committee. Today, this preparatory committee issued a \"Letter to the Peasants,\" telling our peasants how to achieve liberation. In the past, our liberation was not well done, and land was not divided fairly because our peasants were not well organized, and in some places, landlords and rich peasants had infiltrated. The future approach is that first, our poor and hired peasants must closely organize together to form poor peasant leagues, and then unite the middle peasants well to establish peasants' associations, so that we can overthrow the landlords. This letter to the peasants will be distributed to the villages, and every peasant must read it carefully, especially our poor and hired peasants. If you are illiterate, ask someone to read it to you. If we understand the principles stated in the \"Letter to the Peasants,\" we can properly handle the thorough and equitable division of land.

The editorial first sharply criticized the erroneous view held by some that \"employed poor peasants are neither Party members nor cadres, how can they participate in Party meetings?\" Then it pointed out: \"These people want to make our Party leave the ground, trick us into mid-air, and strangle us. We should not fall for their trap.\" The article then listed the sixth point of the conclusion of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and the comrades Lenin and Stalin's discussions on the connection between the Party and the masses, advising everyone, and stating: \"Our Party is not a sect, but a revolutionary team representing the proletariat and acting as a vanguard for the people; therefore, we must find the mother, listen to the mother, and regard the good opinions of the masses as valuable instructions.\" The editorial continued: \"In the land reform meetings held in various places, more employed poor peasants and active members of the masses should be invited to participate. However, when employed poor peasants first arrive at Party meetings, they often dare not speak boldly, and the leadership should encourage them to speak and support them. At the Fuping meeting, because the employed poor peasants spoke boldly and criticized the bad cadres, the good and the bad were distinguished at the meeting, righteousness rose, and evil declined. Many cadres also saw their own shortcomings and mistakes clearly and repented. Those who had encroached on the fruits also withdrew them voluntarily. This was mainly because they found the mother and understood in their hearts.\" The editorial concluded, \"The participation of employed poor peasants and active members of the masses in Party meetings is of great help to Party members and cadres. In addition, their participation in discussing our Party's policies and plans makes them understand even more in their hearts. When they return to the village, they will be more active, more progressive, more improved, and more capable. They will have more ways to lead the struggle. This is the children finding the mother, the mother educating the children, and the children also educating the mother; it is also our Party connecting with the masses, the masses teaching us, and we also teaching the masses. In this way, cadres will be trained, the struggle will be correctly led, and fewer mistakes will be made.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “找母亲”　晋察冀日报社论\n\n1948-01-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“找母亲”\n  　晋察冀日报社论\n    【新华社晋察冀电】晋察冀日报日前发表题为“找母亲”社论，指出北岳区党委邀请党外雇贫农群众参加土地改革会议，对于平分土地与整顿队伍作用很大。社论首先尖锐批评了某些人关于“雇贫农既不是党员又不是干部，怎么能参加党的会议”的错误说法后，指出：“这些人想使我们党离开地面，把我们骗到半空中，捏死我们，我们不应上他们的当。”该文继列举联共党史结束语第六条及列宁斯大林同志论党和群众的联系，告诫大家，并称：“我们的党不是一个宗派，而是代表无产阶级，代表人民打先锋的革命队伍；因此要找母亲，听母亲的话，将群众好的意见当做宝贵的指示。”社论继称：“各地所召开的土地改革会议，应多请一些雇贫农积极群众参加。但雇贫农初到党的会议上，往往不敢大胆发言，领导上即应鼓励他们讲话，给他们撑腰。阜平会议由于雇贫农大胆讲话，批评了坏干部，因此在会上使好坏分清，正气上升，邪气下降，许多干部对自己的缺点、错误亦看得清楚了，反省了。侵占果实的亦自动退出。这主要是找到了母亲，心里明白了。”社论最后称“雇贫农积极群众参加党的会议，对党员和干部帮助很大，另外他们参加讨论我们党的政策、计划，使他们心里更明白了。回到村里就更积极、更进步、更提高、更能干了，就更有办法领导斗争，这就是儿女找母亲，母亲教育儿女，儿女亦教育母亲；亦就是我们的党联系群众，群众给我们上课，我们亦给群众上课，这样就培养了干部，就能正确的领导斗争，就会少犯错误。”"

Gromyko condemned \"certain elements\" who are doing their utmost to obstruct the implementation of the partition, causing continuous conflicts and casualties between Arabs and Jews for over a month. Gromyko pointed out: \"The Soviet Union cannot agree with the argument that the so-called partition plan is used to oppose the Arabs. The Soviet Union firmly believes that this decision is in line with the vital interests of both the Arab and Jewish peoples. The basic principle of the Soviet Union's national policy is national equality and self-determination.\" Gromyko stressed: \"The UN General Assembly's decision to divide Palestine into two independent states will end the bankrupt mandate rule, which is of great historical significance.\" Gromyko finally pointed out: \"It is rumored that the British authorities are trying to prevent the United Nations Palestine Commission from entering Palestine before the British troops withdraw.\" He called on Britain to cooperate with the Commission not only in words but also in deeds to solve this problem. Since the UN passed the partition plan on November 29th last year, British and American imperialism have been creating chaos, attempting to delay the implementation of this plan in order to continue their rule in Palestine. They have used the British intelligence chief Clayton to instigate their lackeys among the ruling classes of Arab countries (such as the notorious King Abdullah of Transjordan, the Grand Mufti Husseini, etc.) to oppose the partition plan by exploiting the extreme national sentiments of the Arabs, using the crazy and hypocritical slogans of \"Down with America, down with Britain, down with the Soviet Union, down with the United Nations\" as a guise, but in fact, they are plotting to strangle the progressive forces that truly represent the Arab people. For example, the pro-fascist organization \"Muslim Brotherhood\" in Syria burned down the headquarters of the Syrian Communist Party under the pretext of anti-partition demonstrations, and the Syrian government also announced the dissolution of the Syrian Communist Party under various pretexts. In addition, similar persecutions of communists have occurred in Lebanon. At the same time, the Arab League also advocated the formation of a large Arab army to unify Palestine by force, making the Middle East present a strong atmosphere of war for a time. For more than a month, unfortunate conflicts have continued to occur between Arab and Jewish residents in Jerusalem, Jaffa, and other places, resulting in hundreds of casualties. Recent news shows that the Arab people have gradually awakened through long-term bloodshed experience. For example, when several British police officers instigated villagers in the Arab Alahu-ber district to attack the Jews in neighboring villages, they were angrily driven away by the Arabs in the village.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 揭穿美英挑拨阴谋　主张分治巴勒斯坦　葛罗米柯发表演说\n\n1948-01-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　揭穿美英挑拨阴谋\n  　主张分治巴勒斯坦\n  　葛罗米柯发表演说\n    【新华社陕北十八日电】纽约讯：苏联外次兼驻联合国代表葛罗米柯，近在千余美籍犹太领袖之宴会上发表演说，力促尽速实现联合国分治巴勒斯坦之决定。葛氏谴责“某种分子”正竭力进行阻挠实行分治之活动，致引起阿拉伯人与犹太人间月余以来不断的冲突和死伤。葛氏指出：“对于所谓分治计划乃用以反对阿拉伯人之言论，苏联不能同意。苏联坚信此一决定实与阿、犹两民族之切身利益相符。苏联民族政策之基本原则，即为民族平等与自决”。葛氏力称：“联大划分巴勒斯坦为两个独立国之决定，将结束业已破产之委任统治，这具有重大的历史意义。”葛氏最后指出：“传闻英国当局企图阻止联合国巴勒斯坦委员会在英军撤退以前进入巴勒斯坦”，他呼吁英国不仅在口头上，且在实际上与该委员会合作，以解决此一问题。按自联大于去年十一月二十九日通过分治计划后，英美帝国主义即制造纷乱，企图延缓此项计划之实行，以便继续其在巴勒斯坦之统治。它们曾通过英国特务头子克莱顿将军唆使其在阿拉伯诸国统治阶级中之走狗（如臭名昭著之外约但王阿布杜拉、回教主胡赛尼等），利用阿拉伯人偏激之民族感情，反对分治计划，以“打倒美国，打倒英国，打倒苏联，打倒联合国”之疯狂虚伪口号为幌子，实则阴谋扼杀真正代表阿拉伯人民之进步力量。例如叙利亚亲法西斯组织“回教兄弟会”即借反分治游行焚毁叙共总部，叙政府亦以各种借口宣布解散叙共。此外在黎巴嫩亦有类似之迫害共产党事件。同时阿拉伯联盟并倡议筹组阿拉伯大军，以武力统一巴勒斯坦，使中东一时呈现浓厚之战争气氛。月余以来，在耶路撒冷、雅法诸地，阿、犹居民间曾不断发生不幸之冲突，死伤已达数百人。最近消息，阿拉伯人民在长期流血经验中，已逐渐觉悟，如最近若干英国警察在煽动阿拉伯阿拉虎伯区村民攻击邻村之犹太人时，即遭该村阿人愤怒驱逐。"

    "date": "1948-01-20",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "To all farmer brothers and sisters in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region!\n\n　　For the past two years, our border region has carried out a vigorous land reform movement. About ten million people in the entire border region have been completely liberated, but about twenty million people have not been thoroughly liberated, only half-liberated, or only nominally liberated.\n\n　　Now things are better. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China promulgated the Outline Land Law of China on October 10th last year, which is perfect and will guarantee that every one of our farmers will be completely liberated.\n\n　　In the past, we made mistakes in implementing the \"Land to the Tiller\" movement in our border region. Some leading organs, groups, and cadres of the troops, either because they themselves were landlords or rich peasants, or because they were not landlords or rich peasants but listened to the opinions of landlords and rich peasants, intentionally or unintentionally shielded some landlords and rich peasants. Some leading organs, groups, and cadres of the troops excessively emphasized taking care of the families of military personnel, cadres, and martyrs. As a result, some landlords and rich peasants among the families of military personnel, cadres, and martyrs were not struggled against or were not struggled against thoroughly. Some families of military personnel, cadres, and martyrs, although not landlords or rich peasants, also received too much fruit. Some places used to distribute the fruits based on problems, whether one was in the farmers' association, and whether one was active in the struggle, resulting in an unfair distribution of fruits, with a few people getting more and most people getting less. In particular, some cadres and activists took advantage of their positions to seize more fruits. As a result, some landlords and rich peasants were not thoroughly struggled against, and even if some landlords and rich peasants were thoroughly struggled against, the distribution of fruits was very unfair, and the poor and hired peasants were still not completely and thoroughly liberated.\n\n　　The Outline Land Law can precisely correct the above faults. Articles 1 to 3 clearly stipulate that all feudal and semi-feudal exploitative land systems must be abolished, and a \"Land to the Tiller\" land system must be implemented. That is to say, regardless of whether you are a family of military personnel, cadres, and martyrs, or whether you are a county magistrate, commander, or high-ranking cadre, no exceptions are allowed. As long as it is feudal or semi-feudal exploitation, it must be thoroughly abolished and must not be shielded. Article 6 of the Outline Land Law also clearly stipulates that land and property should be uniformly and equally distributed according to population. The method is simple and clear: those with problems get a share, those without problems also get a share, those with merits get a share, those without merits also get a share, landlords are also given a share, and rich peasants are also allowed to keep a share. Some of the middle peasants will have to take out some land, some will have to be allocated some land and property, and the rest will remain largely unchanged. Those who have not been equally distributed in the past must be leveled out, and those who have gained too much must return it. The method of extracting from the excess and supplementing the deficient, extracting from the fat and supplementing the lean must be used to truly achieve leveling and replenishment, so that no one gets more and no one gets less.\n\n　　Who should we rely on to fight against landlords and rich peasants? Who should we rely on to fairly and reasonably distribute land and property? Needless to say, everyone knows that we rely on the peasants themselves to organize and fight, and to distribute land and property themselves. But in this regard, we also made mistakes in the past, that is, the ranks of our peasants were not pure and were not well organized. In some places, landlords, rich peasants, and ruffians sneaked in and seized our leadership, and the poor and hired peasants were instead slandered as \"backward elements.\" How could such a team thoroughly fight feudalism? How could it fairly distribute land and property? In some places, the peasants themselves did not take charge, and everything relied on government staff or cadres from outside to move stones and fight feudalism. As a result, the landlords and rich peasants were fought for a while, but the poor and hired peasants were confused and still not liberated. The Outline Land Law can correct this mistake. Article 5 clearly stipulates that the poor peasant leagues, farmers' associations, and farmer representative conferences are the legal administrative organs for equalizing land distribution. They have the right and power to take the power into the hands of our peasants themselves. No one can restrict them, and no one can infringe on them.\n\n　　How to organize the poor peasant leagues? What is the relationship between them and the farmers' associations? This issue must be clarified. Simply put, poor peasants, hired peasants, rural workers, and other poor people can form poor peasant leagues. They are the backbone, leaders, and main force in carrying out land reform. Then, by linking up with all the middle peasants, we can form farmers' associations, which is the joint army for carrying out land reform. The poor peasant league is the general staff headquarters, which is extremely important. The election of poor peasant league officers must be very serious. We must elect those who have worked for many years, are upright, selfless, and wholeheartedly serve everyone. The election of farmer association officers is also the same, but a few good middle peasants should be added. For members, we must self-report and publicly discuss, compare each other, determine composition, and compare good and bad, so that landlords, rich peasants, and ruffians cannot sneak in.\n\n　　Why must land reform rely on poor and hired peasants to organize poor peasant leagues? Because poor and hired peasants now account for 50 to 70 percent of the rural population. They are the most numerous, working all year round. They till the land, build the houses, and weave the cloth. But they often have no food to eat, no house to live in, and no clothes to wear. They live the hardest lives. They are the most oppressed, the most exploited, and the most despised. Therefore, poor and hired peasants are the most revolutionary. They are born as the revolutionary class. They are naturally the leaders of the liberation movement. Relying on poor and hired peasants is a matter of course. But can we despise or slightly despise the issue of consolidating and uniting the middle peasants? This is absolutely not allowed. Middle peasants are also numerous, now accounting for more than 20 percent of the rural population. They are naturally one family with poor and hired peasants. They are also exploited and oppressed by landlords. They also agree with equalizing land distribution. Without them to participate in the struggle against landlords and rich peasants, the poor and hired peasants will be isolated and will not be able to defeat the resistance of landlords and rich peasants. In the past, we did not understand clearly who we must rely on, who we must unite with, who leads, and who participates. We also did not have such a complete set of organizations, so we had no strength in the struggle.\n\n　　We must strictly prevent landlords and rich peasants from undermining the unity of our peasants. This time, when we re-examine the implementation of land reform and the equal distribution movement, landlords and rich peasants will definitely sow discord and undermine the unity of our peasants. Some people are openly landlords and rich peasants, standing outside us to sow discord and undermine unity. Some people pretend to be our own people (such as landlords, rich peasants, and their lackeys who have infiltrated the ranks of district and village cadres), standing inside us to sow discord and undermine unity. Both types of people are equally bad. We must always be vigilant and prevent being deceived. Our peasants must not undermine their own unity. Whoever sows discord among the peasants and makes them disunited is committing a crime. It is forbidden to attack poor and hired peasants, it is forbidden to exclude middle peasants, and it is forbidden to create disharmony and conflicts between streets, villages, the Zhang family and the Li family, and this religion and that religion. Those who dare to disobey will be severely punished and will not be forgiven.\n\n　　Land reform is a sacred and inviolable cause. The feudal and semi-feudal exploitative land system must be eliminated. If anyone resists or sabotages it, no mercy will be shown, and they must be sent to the people's court for severe punishment. No matter who he is, landlords and rich peasants go without saying, even if he is a group cadre, a government cadre, a military cadre, or a Communist Party member, as long as he sabotages land reform, he will be arrested and handed over to the people's court for severe punishment.\n\n　　Those who protect and support landlords and rich peasants and openly obstruct and sabotage land reform must be opposed. Those who pretend to oppose landlords and rich peasants but secretly engage in activities that harm the interests of peasants must be opposed. Those who surrender and compromise with landlords and rich peasants must be opposed. Those who act as air-raid shelters for landlords must be opposed. Those who encroach on, steal, and waste the fruits of struggle must also be opposed. Those who, under the pretext of suppressing landlords and rich peasants, kill and disrupt their own peasant ranks must be opposed even more.\n\n　　This outline also clearly stipulates that the government is responsible for effectively guaranteeing the people's democratic rights, guaranteeing our peasants the right to criticize and impeach all cadres at all levels in all aspects, and the right to remove and elect all cadres of the government and peasant organizations. No one is allowed to infringe on these basic rights of the people. We must not only liberate ourselves economically, but also politically. A government that cannot guarantee the people's political freedom and democratic rights, we must rise up and transform it. We must not only control the poor peasant leagues and farmers' associations in our own hands, but also control the rural militia armed forces and rural political power in our own hands. We must support good cadres and remove bad cadres. We must also place the Communist Party under our supervision. We must control our own destiny in our own hands. We shout: \"All power to the Farmer Representative Conference!\"\n\n　　After the completion of land reform, we must also establish a people's representative conference regime from bottom to top. People's governments are elected by people's representative conferences at all levels. Except for reactionaries and those who have been deprived of their civil rights, all may participate in the elections of people's representative conferences at all levels, which is the highest authority in the liberated areas. In the countryside, the farmer representative conference is the highest authority in the countryside. This will ensure that the power is in the hands of our peasants. Peasants are also completely liberated politically.\n\n　　The Outline Land Law of China was promulgated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region issued a letter to party members. The border region government issued a proclamation on the implementation of the Outline Land Law of China and supplementary measures, and promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Crimes Against Land Reform and the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Corruption. The military region issued an order to the army to implement the Outline Land Law of China. From now on, no one can obstruct and sabotage land reform.\n\n　　Our preparatory committee was elected by the all-region land conference last December and is dedicated to preparing all matters for the all-region farmer representative conference. This preparatory committee is temporary. Once the border region farmers' association is officially established and takes charge of all matters in the entire border region, our task will be completed.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　January 20, 1948\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋冀鲁豫边区农会筹备委员会　告农民书\n\n1948-01-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋冀鲁豫边区农会筹备委员会\n  　告农民书全边区农民兄弟姐妹们！\n    两年以来，我们边区曾进行了轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动，全边区约有一千万人口已经彻底翻身，但还约有两千万人口翻身不很彻底，翻了半个身，或者只翻了个空身。\n    现在好了，中共中央于去年十月十日公布了中国土地法大纲，尽美尽善，它将保证我们每个农民都彻底翻身。\n    过去我们边区在实行耕者有其田运动中出了毛病。有些领导机关、团体和部队的干部，或者他自己本身是地主、富农出身、或者他虽不是地主、富农出身，但是他听了地主、富农的议论，有意无意的包庇了一部分地主、富农；有些领导机关、团体和部队的干部，过分强调照顾军干烈属，因而某些军干烈属的地主、富农，没有斗或者斗的不彻底，某些军干烈属虽不是地主、富农，他们也多分了果实；有些地方曾经是按问题、按在不在农会、按斗争积极不积极分果实，结果果实分的不公道，少数人多得，多数人少得。特别有些干部积极分子，利用自己地位，多占了果实。这样一来，有些地主、富农没有斗彻底，有些地主、富农虽然斗的很彻底了，但果实分配的很不公平，贫雇农仍然没有完全彻底翻身。\n    土地法大纲恰恰可以纠正以上毛病，第一条至第三条明白规定，废除一切封建性半封建性剥削的土地制度，实行耕者有其田的土地制度。那就是说，不管你是军干烈属也好，不管你是县长、司令、大干部也好，都不准例外，只要是封建性半封建性的剥削，就都得彻底废除，不得包庇。土地法大纲第六条又明白规定，土地财产是按人口统一平均分配，办法简单明了，有问题的分一份，没有问题的也分一份，有功劳的分一份，没有功劳的也分一份，给地主也同样分一份，给富农也同样留一份，中农有一部分要拿出一些土地，有一部分要分进一些土地和财产，另一部分则大体不动。过去没有分平的要填平，多得的要退出，就是用抽多补少、抽肥补瘦的办法，真正做到填平补齐，谁也不多，谁也不少为止。\n    依靠谁来和地主、富农作斗争，依靠谁来公平合理的分配土地和财产呢？不用说，这是大家知道的，是靠咱们农民自己组织起来，自己去进行斗争，自己去分配土地和财产。可是在这一点上，咱们过去也出了毛病，就是咱们农民自己的队伍不纯洁，组织不好。有些地方地主、富农、流氓钻进来了，窃取了咱们的领导权，贫雇农民反而被诬蔑为“落后分子”，这样的队伍，哪里能把封建斗彻底？哪里能把土地财产分公平？有些地方农民自己不当家，全靠政府外来工作人员或者人家干部搬石头、斗封建，结果地主、富农是被斗了一阵，可是贫雇农民莫明其妙，仍未翻身。土地法大纲就能纠正这个毛病，它在第五条上明白规定，贫农团、农会、农代会为平分土地的合法办事机关，它有权有力，把大权拿在咱们农民自己手里，谁也不能限制它，谁也不能侵犯它。\n    如何组织贫农团、它和农会的关系怎么样？这个问题要弄清楚。简单说，贫农、雇农、乡村工人加上其它贫民，就可以组成贫农团，这是进行土地改革的骨干、领导者、也是主力。再由它串连全体中农，就可以组成农会，这是进行土地改革的联合大军。贫农团是参谋部，顶重要。选举贫农团办事人，要十分认真，要选举长年劳动的、为人正派的、大公无私的、一心给大家办事的。选举农会办事人也是一样，不过要加几个好的中农进来。对团员、会员要自报公议，互相比较，定成份，比好坏，不让地主、富农和流氓混进来。\n    为什么土地改革一定要依靠贫农雇农组织贫农团呢？因为，贫农雇农他们现在占乡村人口百分之五十到七十，他们人数最多，长年劳动，地是他们种的，房子是他们盖的，布是他们织的，但他们常常没饭吃、没房住、没衣穿，他们生活最苦，他们最受压迫、最受剥削、最为人所轻视，所以贫农雇农最革命，天生的是革命阶级，他们天然是翻身运动的带头人。依靠贫农雇农是天经地义。但可不可以轻视或者稍微轻视巩固团结中农的问题呢？这，坚决地不可以。中农人数也不少，他们现在占乡村人口百分之二十以上，与贫农雇农天生是一家，一样受地主剥削、压迫，他们也很赞成平分土地。没有他们来参加反对地主、富农的斗争，贫农雇农就要陷于孤立，就不能很好的打败地主、富农的反抗。过去我们就因为没有闹清楚，必须依靠谁，必须团结谁、谁带头、谁参加，也没有这样一套完整的组织，所以斗争起来没有力量。\n    要严防地主、富农破坏咱们农民的团结，我们这次复查土地改革贯彻平分运动，地主、富农一定会从中挑拨离间，破坏咱们农民的团结。一种人是公开的地主、富农面貌，站在咱们外面挑拨离间，破坏团结；一种人是装成自己人（如混进区村干部行列中的地主、富农及其狗腿），站在咱们里面挑拨离间，破坏团结。两种人一样坏，要时刻留神，严防上当。咱们农民更不要自己破坏自己团结，谁要挑拨农民内部不和气、不一心，就是犯罪。不准打击贫农、雇农，不准排斥中农，不准制造街与街、村与村、张家与李家、这教和那教的不和与冲突，如敢违抗，要受到严厉制裁，决不宽恕。\n    土地改革是神圣不可侵犯的事业，封建性和半封建性剥削的土地制度一定要消灭了，如果有人反抗和破坏，决不留情，一定要送交人民法庭严厉制裁。不管他是什么人，地主、富农固不用多说，就是团体干部也好，政府干部也好，军队干部也好，共产党员也好，只要是破坏土地改革的，就把他抓起来，交人民法庭，严予制裁。\n    庇护和支持地主、富农，公然阻碍和破坏土地改革的要反对。表面上装着反对地主、富农的样子，暗地里进行损害农民利益勾当的人要反对。向地主富农投降妥协的要反对。替地主做防空洞的要反对。侵占、窃取和浪费斗争果实的也要反对。借口镇压地主、富农，杀乱了农民自己阵营的人更要反对。\n    这个大纲又明白规定，政府负责切实保障人民的民主权利，保障咱们农民有批评和弹劾各方面各级的一切干部的权利。有撤换和选举政府和农民团体的一切干部的权利。不容许任何人侵犯人民的这种基本权利。我们不仅要在经济上翻身，也要在政治上翻身。不能保障人民的政治自由和民主权利的政府，我们就要起来改造它。我们不仅要把贫农团、农会掌握在我们自己手里，也要把乡村民兵武装、乡村政权都掌握到我们自己手里。拥护好干部，撤换坏干部。我们还要把共产党也放在我们的监督之下。我们要把我们自己的命运掌握在我们自己手里。我们高呼：“一切权力归农代会”。\n    土地改革完成后，还要自下而上的建立人民代表会议的政权。由各级人民代表会选举人民的政府。各级人民代表会除反动分子和被褫夺了公民权的人以外，均可参加选举，它是解放区的最高权力机关。在乡村里说，农民代表会就是乡村里的最高权力机关。这样就做到把政权掌握在咱们农民手里。农民就在政治上也彻底翻身了。\n    中国土地法大纲，是中共中央公布的，中共晋冀鲁豫中央局发表了告党员书，边区政府出了执行中国土地法大纲的布告和补充办法，公布了破坏土地改革治罪暂行条例和惩治贪污暂行条例，军区给军队下了执行中国土地法大纲的命令，以后谁也不能阻碍和破坏土地改革了。\n    我们这个筹备会，是去年十二月全区土地会议推选的，专门筹备全区农民代表大会的一切事宜。这个筹备会是临时的，一俟边区农会正式成立，把全边区的事情管起来以后，我们的任务就结束了。\n  　　　　　　　　　　一九四八年一月二十日"

    "content": "Knowing and Correcting Mistakes is the Only Way Out\n　　After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, the Border Region Government also issued measures to punish those who sabotage land reform. This order from the Border Region Government means that no one can disobey the Land Law Outline. If some people have done wrong things in the past, they become afraid when they hear today's laws, fearing that the masses will deal with them according to the law. These people used to be lawless, had no regard for the masses, took too much fruit, and had bad work styles. Today, understanding the fear of the law and the masses is a transformation. But being afraid should lead them to admit their mistakes to the masses, return the fruit, and change their work styles. As long as they do this, the masses can forgive them and will give these people a chance to correct their mistakes. There is no need to panic and be suspicious. As for some people who still want to take advantage of the fact that the poor peasant leagues and peasant representative conferences have not yet been organized, and don't want to honestly admit their mistakes and return the fruit; on the contrary, they are still secretly burying or selling things. Some are indulging in extravagant eating and drinking to sabotage. Still others are using more subtle methods. They are afraid that the poor peasant leagues will give them opinions, so they secretly bribe poor peasants and give them \"donations.\" These actions are even more foolish. The previous mistakes have not been resolved, and they are committing crimes of sabotaging land reform again. The more they do this, the worse the outcome will be. Crimes found today will be punished today (some people think that crimes cannot be punished today because the people's court has not been established yet, which is wrong, and should be stopped according to the law). Crimes found in the future will be punished in the future. We hope these people will be honest immediately and not add mistakes to mistakes. Finally, we earnestly tell these people that only by being honest, admitting past mistakes, returning the fruit they have taken too much of, and compensating for what they have embezzled, and being able to honestly correct mistakes, can they have a way out. Only those who do not admit their mistakes and act recklessly will not be forgiven by the masses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 知错改错才是出路\n\n1948-01-20\n第1版()\n专栏：短论\n\n　　知错改错才是出路\n    土地法大纲发表后，边区政府又发表了破坏土地改革的治罪的办法；边区政府的这一道命令，就是说谁也不能不按土地法大纲办事；如有的人过去做了些错事，听到今天的法令，便害怕起来，怕群众依法办他们。这些人过去无法无天，目无群众，多占果实，作风不好，今天懂得了怕法令怕群众，是个转变；但害怕就应该向群众承认错误，退出果实，改变作风，只要如此，群众是可以原谅的，会给这些人以改正错误的机会的，用不着惊惶失措，疑神疑鬼。至于有的人还想趁贫农团、农代会没有组织起来以前钻空子，不想老老实实承认错误，退出果实；相反的还在那里把东西偷偷埋藏起来或者卖出去，有的大吃大喝进行破坏，还有的用的办法更巧妙，他们害怕贫农团给他们提意见，便暗中收买贫农，给贫农“捐款”。这些行动更是糊涂，以前的错误还没解决，便又来犯破坏土地改革的罪，越这样干下去，越没有好下场。今天查出，今天办罪，（有些人以为今天没有成立了人民法庭便不能办罪是不对的，应该依法制止。）将来查出，将来办罪。希望这些人立刻老实起来，不要错上加错。最后我们很恳切的告诉这些人，只有老老实实，过去做错了的认错，多拿了果实的退出，贪污了的赔偿。有了错误能老实改正，就一定有出路，只有不认错而又胡闹的人，是群众不能原谅的。"

    "date": "1948-01-20",

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Front, January 17th: A spokesperson for the People's Liberation Army Command here recently issued the following statement regarding the operational history and the evolution of the battle situation in East China over the past year:\n\nIn 1947, the military and civilians of East China crushed Chiang Kai-shek's \"key offensive,\" which concentrated half of the total front-line forces, and in the second half of the year began to shift from interior defense to exterior counter-offensive, liberating vast areas of Su-Lu-Yu-Wan.\n\nAt the end of 1946, our army shattered Chiang's dream of \"solving the Jiangsu-Northern problem in three months,\" achieving seven victories in seven battles in Central Jiangsu. In the Su-Bei Campaign in December, the enemy's 69th Reorganized Division was wiped out and the 11th Reorganized Division was dealt a heavy blow. From January 2nd to 4th of last year, in the area between Xiangcheng and Lanling in southern Shandong, the enemy's 26th Reorganized Division and the 1st Rapid Column were completely annihilated in forty hours. Taking advantage of the victory, Yizao was captured successively on January 10th and 19th, and the enemy's 51st Reorganized Division was completely annihilated. The great victory in the Lu-Nan Campaign, coupled with victories in other battlefields, forced Chiang to abandon his strategy of a full-scale offensive against the Liberated Areas and adopt the so-called \"key offensive.\"\n\nIn early February, the Chiang bandits concentrated 28 brigades as the first-line force for the offensive in southern Shandong; at the same time, 11 brigades were concentrated in Jinan and 6 brigades were concentrated in Qingdao and Weixian, launching a three-pronged offensive towards the Shandong hinterland, clamoring for a \"Shandong battle.\" After the traitor Hao Pengju's defection, the Chiang bandits became even more elated. Our army dispatched a unit south to capture Hao alive and wiped out his two divisions. The Chiang bandits then assumed that the main force of our army was south of Linyi, unaware that our army had only left a small number of troops in the vicinity of Linyi to engage the enemy's main force, while the main force was marching north at full speed, encircling the Chiang bandit Li Xianzhou's corps which had advanced south along the Jiaoji Railway in the Xintai, Laiwu, and Tusikou line. From the evening of February 20th to the 23rd, after sixty hours of fierce fighting, the enemy's two divisions, seven brigades, and more than 50,000 troops were completely and cleanly annihilated. At the same time, our army in Jiaodong also wiped out more than 4,000 enemy troops from the Chiang bandit 8th Division who had invaded north from Weixian. As a result, the Chiang bandits, advancing from the north and south, paid the price of one route being annihilated and the other being routed, and obtained an empty city of Linyi.\n\nBy early April, the Chiang bandits had again gathered 600,000 to 700,000 troops. The Tang Enbo corps invaded north along the Lin-Meng Highway, the Ou Zhen corps invaded east along the Si(shui)-Fei(xian) Highway, and the Wang Jingjiu corps attempted to connect with the Chiang bandits besieged in Jinan from western Shandong. However, before long, our army captured Tai'an on April 26th, completely annihilating the enemy's 72nd Reorganized Division. At that time, Wang Jingjiu's main force was only a day's march from Tai'an but dared not reinforce, and watched as the non-direct troops were annihilated. At the same time, our left-wing corps annihilated the Chiang bandit's \"Number One Regiment Under Heaven\" between Qingtuo and Duozhuang, and severely damaged its main force, the 11th Reorganized Division, at the foot of Mount Meng. By early May, the Chiang bandits reorganized their ranks and advanced side by side towards the Yimeng Mountains. This was the peak of the Chiang bandits' \"key offensive\" against East China. With its 74th Reorganized Division, one of its five main forces, as the central assault corps, each with three reorganized divisions on its left and right wings. When the enemy's 74th Reorganized Division advanced south to Tanbu, our army suddenly penetrated the middle of the enemy's two wing corps. After fierce fighting from May 13th to 16th, the entire 74th Reorganized Division was annihilated at Menglianggu, and the Chiang bandits coming to aid from the north and south were routed. From then on, our army began to win the initiative in the East China battlefield.\n\nAfter June 25th, although the Chiang bandits still mobilized its main force of ten divisions and more than 300,000 troops, advancing towards the Yilu Mountains on a battlefield of less than 50 kilometers, implementing a scorched-earth policy of mass burning and killing, our army counterattacked the flanks and rear of the Chiang bandits, liberating Feixian and vast areas of southern Shandong, and annihilating the 37th Brigade of the 59th Reorganized Division and another regiment. Our western line corps again captured Tai'an, Ningyang, and Dakou, threatening Xuzhou and cutting off the rear supply line of the Chiang bandits attacking the Yilu Mountains. Our central corps inflicted annihilating blows on the Chiang bandits in the Nanma and Linqu areas, with the 11th Reorganized Division and the 8th Reorganized Division suffering the heaviest losses. At this time, our western line corps cooperated with the crossing of the river counter-offensive of the Liu-Deng army, forcing the enemy to withdraw troops from the East China mountains to the west to reinforce, completely disrupting the enemy's deployment, and the Chiang bandits' \"key offensive\" against the East China battlefield fell into fragmentation.\n\nOn September 8th, our westward counter-offensive army annihilated the Chiang bandit's 57th Reorganized Division in Shatuji, western Shandong, and in late September, following the Liu-Deng army, crossed the Longhai Railway southward, liberating more than 20 cities in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, and expanding the new Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Liberated Area. By this time, the Chiang bandits' key offensive was completely ended, forcing the Chiang bandits to adopt a strategic defense. At that time, the Chiang bandits still maintained their local offensive on the Jiaodong battlefield, but since the end of September, our eastern line corps annihilated two and a half enemy brigades in Jiaohe and Yexian, and successively captured Zhucheng and Gaomi. Our army in Jiaodong also shifted to a counter-offensive. Our army, persisting behind the enemy in central China, also developed from guerrilla warfare into a powerful force attacking enemy towns. In the Battle of Yancheng on August 12th, a division of Hao's remnant forces was annihilated.\n\nIn early November, our army breached 400 li of the Xulan section of the Longhai Railway, annihilating more than 10,000 troops of the Chiang bandit's 7th Brigade of the 24th Provisional Division and other units. In mid-December, our army again cooperated with the Chen-Xie army to launch a thousand-li strategic breach on the Longhai and Pinghan Railways, and went south along the Pinghan Railway to cooperate in combat, annihilating the Chiang bandit's 5th Corps Headquarters and the 3rd Reorganized Division south of Xiping, and severely damaging the 20th Reorganized Division in Queshan. Another unit of our army liberated Dongming and Kaocheng. From December 13th to 30th, our army annihilated a total of more than 30,000 Chiang bandit troops. The Su-Lu-Yu-Wan and Yu-Shaan-E, E-Yu-Wan three major liberated areas are connected into one vast area, and the three major liberation armies joined forces in the Central Plains, forming an unprecedentedly powerful force.\n\nOur eastern line corps captured Laiyang and Haiyang in November, annihilating more than 10,000 enemy troops, and in December, defeated eight enemy brigades that re-invaded Laiyang, annihilating more than 8,000 enemy troops. After the Chiang bandits successively dispatched its four reorganized divisions, the 9th, 25th, 28th, and 54th, the Chiang bandits could only hold on to a corner of Qingdao, Yantai, and Longkou. Most of the towns and cities returned to our hands, and the situation in Jiaodong fundamentally changed.\n\nAfter annihilating 9,000 Chiang bandit troops in early December, our army in central China again annihilated the enemy's \"Encirclement and Suppression Column,\" the 51st Reorganized Division (rebuilt), and other units totaling more than 7,000 troops between Ye(ting)nan and Wuyou. By this time, our army, persisting behind the enemy, also seized the strategic initiative.\n\nOur strategic situation today is extremely favorable, completely different from last year when we were under the \"key offensive\" of the Chiang bandits' 600,000 to 700,000 troops. This power to turn the tide is the result of the wise strategic guidance of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the brilliant command of Chief Commanders Chen and Su, the strong cooperation of the liberated areas, and the heroic, tenacious, fearless, selfless, tireless, and continuous struggle of our military and civilians in East China. Based on the victories we have achieved in 1947, with continued efforts in the future, we firmly believe that in the subsequent cooperation with powerful brotherly corps, we will certainly annihilate more enemies and win the final victory.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 粉碎蒋匪七十万人“重点进攻”　我军转入反攻解放广大新区  华东解放军发言人谈一年战局\n\n1948-01-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　粉碎蒋匪七十万人“重点进攻”\n  　我军转入反攻解放广大新区\n    华东解放军发言人谈一年战局\n    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线十七日电】此间人民解放军司令部发言人顷就华东一年来作战经过及战局演变发表谈话如下：\n    一九四七年一年中，华东军民粉碎了蒋介石集中第一线总兵力一半的“重点进攻”，并在下半年开始由内线防御转入外线反攻，解放了苏鲁豫皖广大地区。\n    一九四六年底，我军打破了蒋贼“三个月解决苏北问题”的迷梦。在苏中七战七捷。十二月宿北战役，又歼灭蒋匪整六十九师及予整十一师以痛击。再于去年一月二日至四日在鲁南向城及兰陵间四十小时内全歼蒋匪整二十六师及第一快速纵队。乘胜于一月十日十九日先后攻克峄枣，全歼蒋匪整五十一师。鲁南战役的大捷，配合其他战场的胜利，就使蒋匪不得不放弃了对解放区全面进攻的战略而采取所谓“重点进攻”。\n    二月初蒋匪集中了二十八个旅作为进攻鲁南的第一线兵力；同时并由济南集中了十一个旅，由青岛潍县集中了六个旅，分三路向山东腹地进攻，叫嚣“山东会战”。在郝逆鹏举叛变后，蒋贼更得意忘形，我军当以一部南下生擒郝逆，并歼其两个师，蒋匪乃以为我军主力在临沂以南，不知我军仅留少数部队在临沂近郊与敌主力周旋，而主力则兼程北上，合围由胶济线南下的蒋匪李仙洲兵团于新泰、莱芜、吐丝口一线。自二月二十日晚至二十三日经六十小时的激战，全部干脆歼灭了敌两个师七个旅五万余众。同时胶东我军也歼灭由潍县北犯的蒋匪第八师四千余人。于是南北对进的蒋匪，以一路被歼，一路被击溃的代价，摸得了一座临沂空城。\n    至四月初，蒋匪又集结了六七十万兵力，汤恩伯兵团沿临蒙公路北犯，欧震兵团沿泗（水）费（县）东犯，王敬久兵团则自鲁西与困守济南的蒋匪沟通联系，然而为时不久，我军又于四月二十六日攻克泰安，全歼蒋匪整七十二师，当时王敬久主力距泰安不过一日行程而未敢增援，坐视非嫡系部队被歼。与此同时我左翼兵团于青驼、垛庄间歼灭了蒋匪的“天下第一团”，并重创其主力整十一师于蒙山之麓。到五月初旬，蒋匪重整阵营，向沂蒙山区齐头并进，这是蒋匪对华东“重点进攻”的最高峰。以其五大主力之一的整七十四师为中央突击兵团，各以三个整编师为其左右翼，当蒋匪整七十四师进到坦埠以南时，我军突然深入敌人两翼兵团之中间，经五月十三日至十六日的激战后，于孟良崮全部歼灭整七十四师，并击溃了南北来援的蒋匪。从此我军开始赢得了华东战场的主动权。\n    其后六月二十五日起，蒋贼虽仍然调集其主力十个师三十余万之众，在不足五十公里正面的战场，向沂鲁山区前进，施行大烧大杀的毁灭政策，我军则反击蒋匪侧后，解放费县及鲁南广大地区，歼灭了整五十九师的三十七旅及另一个团。我西线兵团再克泰安、宁阳及大汶口，威胁徐（州）＠（州），切断了进攻沂鲁山区的蒋匪后方补给线，我中央兵团则在南麻、临朐地区予蒋匪以歼灭性打击，尤以整十一师、整八师损失最重。这时我西线兵团配合了刘邓大军的渡河反攻，迫使敌不得不自华东山区抽兵西援，完全打乱了敌人的部署，蒋匪对华东战场的“重点进攻”遂陷入支离破碎。\n    九月八日我西进反攻大军，在鲁西沙土集歼灭蒋匪整五十七师，并于九月下旬继刘邓大军之后，越陇海路南下，解放了豫皖苏二十余城，扩大了苏鲁豫皖新解放区，至此彻底地结束了蒋匪的重点进攻，逼使蒋匪采取战略防御。当时蒋匪尚在胶东战场保持其局部的攻势，但自九月底，我东线兵团在胶河、掖县歼灭蒋匪两个半旅，续克诸城、高密，胶东我军也转入了反攻。坚持蒋后的华中我军也由游击战争发展为进攻敌人城镇的强大力量。八月十二日攻克盐城之役，歼郝逆残部一个师。\n    十一月上旬我军破击陇海路徐兰段四百余里，歼蒋匪暂二十四师第七旅等部万余人。十二月中旬我军又协同陈谢大军对陇海、平汉两路展开千里的战略破击，并沿平汉路南下协同作战，歼蒋匪第五兵团司令部及整三师于西平以南，又在确山重创整二十师。我军另部则解放东明、考城。自十二月十三日至三十日，我军共歼蒋匪三万余人。苏鲁豫皖与豫陕鄂，鄂豫皖三大解放区在广大地区上联成一片，三大解放军会师中原，结成空前强大的劲旅。\n    我东线兵团于十一月攻克莱阳、海阳歼敌万余，并于十二月间击溃再犯莱阳的蒋匪八个旅，歼敌八千余名，自蒋匪续调出其九、二十五、二十八及五十四等四个整编师后，蒋匪仅能困守青岛、烟台、龙口一隅，大部城镇重归我手，胶东形势根本改变。\n    华中我军于十二月初歼蒋匪九千人后，又在叶（挺）南与伍佑间歼敌“进剿纵队”整五十一师（该师系重建）等部七千余人，至此，坚持蒋后的我军也夺得了战略的主动权。\n    我们今天的战略形势极为有利，比起去年处在蒋匪六七十万人的“重点进攻”时，已经完全两样了。这种扭转乾坤的力量是毛主席、朱总司令英明的战略指导，是陈粟首长天才的指挥，是各解放区有力的配合，是我华东军民英勇顽强、不怕牺牲、不辞劳苦、不懈不休地连续奋斗的结果。我们在一九四七年已得的胜利的基础上，加以今后的继续努力，深信在此后与强大的兄弟兵团协同作战中，一定将更大的歼灭敌人，赢得最后的胜利。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui, 17th. General Su Yu delivered Chairman Mao's report at a cadre meeting of directly subordinate units in a certain area on the front line on the afternoon of the 12th, calling on the entire army to study it in depth in connection with reality, and at the same time summed up the achievements of the East China People's Liberation Army in the past year. He said: In the past year, we have annihilated 300,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits. If we add the achievements of the East Line Corps, the Central China People's Liberation Army, and the East China Local Armed Forces after August, we have annihilated at least more than 400,000 enemies. This is the result of the joint struggle of the entire party, government, army and people under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Our army is six times stronger than it was a year ago, and we have captured a large number of enemy weapons in battles, which has improved our equipment. Our artillery has become fifteen times stronger in the past year. In recent battles, we have effectively eliminated the enemy with a large number of automatic weapons such as Thompson submachine guns, carbines, and submachine guns. Now our army has all the new weapons of the enemy, and can use them skillfully. Combat technology has been greatly improved, especially after the merit campaign, land reform study, and grievance campaign, the class consciousness has been greatly improved. When talking about the changes in the East China war situation in the past year, General Su Yu said: \"After a year of hard fighting in Shandong in the first half of last year, our army finally smashed Chiang Kai-shek's 'key offensive' of 600,000 to 700,000 troops, and enabled our army to switch to a strategic counter-offensive. We have not only defended the basic areas of East China, restored the vast areas of central Shandong, southern Shandong, Binhai, Jiaodong, southwestern Shandong and central China, but also opened up the new liberated areas of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan and Anhui, and connected them with the two major liberated areas of Hubei-Henan-Anhui and Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei.\" Finally, he asked the entire army to continue to work hard, overcome its own weaknesses, and complete six major tasks: (1) Annihilate a large number of Chiang Kai-shek's regular and local troops. (2) Extensively mobilize the masses to build and consolidate the new liberated areas of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan and Anhui. The entire army should regard doing a good job in mass work as equally important as combat. Even in a certain period, mass work is more important than combat. (3) The entire army is required to complete land reform study for the troops in the near future, and implement the three investigations and three rectifications - investigate class, investigate ideology, investigate work, rectify organization, rectify discipline, and rectify system. In order to consolidate and strengthen the combat effectiveness of our army, so that every commander and fighter can wholeheartedly fight for the complete liberation of the Chinese people. (4) Oppose localism, remaining sectarianism and mountain-stronghold mentality. (5) Advocate the style of hard work and simplicity, improve work efficiency, streamline the organs, and strengthen the company. (6) Improve military technology, especially learn to attack fortifications, in order to usher in a greater victory in 1948.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 粟裕将军　传达毛主席报告　号召全军完成六大任务\n\n1948-01-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　粟裕将军\n  　传达毛主席报告\n  　号召全军完成六大任务\n    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线十七日电】粟裕将军于十二日下午在前线某地直属队干部大会上传达毛主席报告，号召全军联系实际，深入学习，并同时总结华东解放军一年来战绩。他说：我们在过去一年中歼灭了蒋匪三十万人，如果加上八月以后东线兵团、华中解放军及华东地方武装的战绩则至少歼敌四十万以上，这是全体党政军民在毛主席领导下共同奋斗的结果。我军较去年今日壮大了六倍，而且在战斗中大量的缴获了敌人的武器，改善了我们的装备。我军炮兵一年来就强大了十五倍。在最近的战斗中，我们已经以大量的汤姆枪、卡宾枪、手提冲锋枪等自动火器有效的消灭敌人。现在敌人所有的新式武器，我军都有了，而且能熟练的使用它。战斗技术大大提高，特别是经过立功运动，土地改革学习，诉苦运动之后，阶级觉悟大大提高。粟裕将军于讲到一年来华东战局的变化时称：“我军经过去年上半年在山东艰苦奋战，终于粉碎了蒋介石六七十万军队的‘重点进攻’，并使我军转入了战略反攻。我们不但保卫了华东的基本地区，恢复了鲁中、鲁南、滨海、胶东、鲁西南及华中的广大地区，而且开辟了苏鲁豫皖新解放区，与鄂豫皖、豫陕鄂两大解放区连成了一片”。最后，他要求全军继续努力，克服自己的弱点，完成六大任务：（一）大量歼灭蒋匪正规军与地方军。（二）广泛发动群众，建设与巩固苏鲁豫皖新解放区，全军应把做好群众工作与作战当作同等重要的任务。甚至在某一时期，群众工作比作战还更重要。（三）全军要求最近期间完成部队土地改革学习，实行三查、三整——查阶级、查思想、查工作，整组织、整纪律、整制度。以巩固和加强我军战斗力，使每个指战员都能全心全意的为中国人民的彻底解放而奋斗到底。（四）反对本位主义、残存的宗派主义与山头主义。（五）提倡艰苦朴素的作风，提高工作效率，精简机关，加强连队。（六）提高军事技术尤其要学习攻坚，以迎接一九四八年更伟大的胜利。"

Four impoverished people (all hired laborers) and two poor peasants, who had just moved from the temple, participated. They first discussed the situation of emancipation. Old Lady Li said, \"I am an impoverished household and have been allocated a cabinet seat.\" Li Encheng said, \"I am a poor peasant, and people only gave me two flower vases.\" Then everyone scrambled to talk about the struggle in the second half of last year: \"From the struggle that started on the second day of the sixth lunar month, we struggled for five or six months. The meetings delayed production, and we divided some land, but we didn't harvest any grain in the autumn. Now it's all eaten up. But up to now, the village peasant association still has more than two qing of good irrigated land, three hundred or so cloth bags (four dou per bag) of grain, vegetables, and furniture… that have not been distributed. Sixteen or seventeen livestock are all starved to the bone, and one recently died.\" When talking about the reasons for not being thoroughly emancipated, everyone unanimously said: \"Poor people's words don't count. There are thirty or so poor peasant households in the whole village, and not a single one is a cadre.\" When the central government's Outline Land Law was told to everyone, they listened very attentively. When it came to the thorough distribution of land, first satisfying the demands of the poor and hired peasants, they said: \"That's how it should be. That's what you call true emancipation; otherwise, it will still be uneven.\" When it came to peasants being in charge, they were particularly interested: \"In the past, it was the middle peasants who were emancipated.

Niu Quanyang, from Tuanchi West, joined the Miaodao Society in 1940, and in 1941, he joined the bandit Ji Zhenkui's gang. In January 1945, he became a member of the Japanese puppet police force, wholeheartedly engaging in traitorous activities. He followed the Japanese devils from Gaoping to Luan and Qin counties, looting, making a fortune, and even bullying women. After we liberated Qin County, he fled to Yan Xishan's bandit troops, continuing to harm the people. Last October, he returned from Pingyao and infiltrated the militia. Only now has he been exposed. Guo Jihai, the director of the Guo Village Military Committee, was also a major bad egg. He had served in Yan Xishan's army for three years. After returning, he smoked opium, frequented prostitutes, engaged in improper conduct, shielded targets of struggle, embezzled the fruits of struggle, oppressed good people, and sabotaged weapons. He had already expelled eight hired poor peasants from the militia alone. He also took advantage of his position as director of the Military Committee to rape women.

From the leading cadres to the odd-job personnel, all must participate in the study, without exception. It is pointed out that implementing the Outline Land Law of China is a revolutionary historical task, requiring every comrade to earnestly engage in study with a serious and responsible attitude. Since the \"May 4th\" directive, many organs have not organized everyone to seriously study the relevant land reform documents, resulting in many comrades committing mistakes without even knowing it, let alone the whole Party uniformly promoting land reform. The reason why these comrades made mistakes is, of course, due to problems in their thinking, and not caring about land reform, but one of the reasons is also that the leading comrades did not effectively educate those below. In the future, we must remember this lesson, and in conjunction with rectifying the ranks, universally and deeply carry out land reform education, and no comrade will be allowed to not understand the Outline Land Law, and no comrade will be allowed to not care about land reform work. Not only must they study themselves, but they must also publicize it to the masses and patiently explain difficult problems to them.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中央局宣传部决定　各机关一切人员都要学习土地法\n\n1948-01-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中央局宣传部决定\n  　各机关一切人员都要学习土地法\n    【本报消息】中央局宣传部决定：各级党政军民机关团体，必须学习中国土地法大纲、边府关于执行土地法大纲补充办法、边府拥护土地法布告、军区给部队执行土地法的命令、告党员书、告农民书等文件；自首长至杂务人员，一律参加学习，均不得例外。指出执行中国土地法大纲，是一个革命的历史任务，要求每个同志，以严肃负责的态度，认真进行学习。“五四”指示以来，很多机关没有组织大家认真学习有关土地改革的文件，以致很多同志犯了错误还不知道，更说不上全党一致推动土地改革的进行了。这些同志之所以犯错误，固然由于他们思想上有问题，不关心土地改革，而领导同志没有对下面切实进行教育，也是原因之一。今后必须记取这一教训，结合整顿队伍，普遍而深入的进行土地改革教育，再不许有一个同志不懂得土地法大纲，不许有一个同志不关心土地改革工作。不仅自己学习，还须向群众宣传、给他们耐心的解释疑难问题。"

In some places, poor peasants, hired laborers, and middle peasants spontaneously rose up to expose these conspiracies and adopted necessary control measures. However, some places have not yet been alert to this problem. In Beiliangtun, Neiqiu, the landlord heard that he would be given a share and walked differently than before, swaggering around everywhere, becoming rampant for a time. To prevent the landlords from making trouble, the poor peasants and hired laborers proposed dividing the work between men and women during discussions of the Land Law, and everyone monitoring the activities of the landlords. Liu Qiufu, the landlord of Guozhuang Village, Shexian County, heard that the Land Law Outline had been promulgated, and he stole the newspaper while the village teacher was not at home. After reading it, he couldn't sleep and started singing in bed early in the morning. The female landlord Wang Qiao'e heard that the land would be divided equally and everyone would get a share, so she called her sister back to wait for a share (her sister had left her grandmother's house last year after the struggle). The masses in the village pointed at her and said, \"You fellow, you take advantage of every opportunity. Whether we give you a share is our business. If you don't bow your head, it won't work!\" Hao Xianzhi, a rich peasant in Tongtan Town, Zuoquan, heard that the land was going to be divided equally, so he hurriedly ground the wheat he had harvested into flour and ate seven meals of dumplings in a row. No one controlled this illegal behavior of his. The masses in North Xingtou, Huguan, established an inspection committee to register and prevent landlords from selling or wasting resources before the equal distribution. If any landlord engages in sabotage, in addition to being stopped on the spot, they will also settle accounts with him during the equal distribution.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北行头成立巡查委员会　制止地主破坏土地法\n\n1948-01-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北行头成立巡查委员会\n  　制止地主破坏土地法\n    【太行消息】据涉县、壶关、左权、内邱等县通讯员报导：土地法大纲到了村里，有些地主富农便乘机钻空子，大吃大喝，想法破坏；有些地方贫雇与中农自动起来揭发这种阴谋，并采取了必要的管制办法。有些地方对这个问题却还没有警惕注意。内邱北良屯的地主听说要给地主分一份，走路和以前也不一样了，翘起膀子到处跳，一时猖狂起来。贫雇为防止地主捣乱，便在讨论土地法时，提出了男女分工，大家监视地主活动的办法。涉县郭庄村的地主刘秋福听说土地法大纲颁布了，他乘村里教员不在家将报纸偷去，看了以后，连觉都睡不着，早早的就在被窝里唱起来了。女地主王巧的听说平分土地每人都有一份，便去把她妹妹叫回来等着分一份（她妹妹在去年斗争罢，就跟她奶奶另走了一家）。村内的群众指着她说：“你这家伙见空就钻，给你分一份是我们的事，你要不低头，可不行！”左权桐滩镇富农郝献芝听说要平分，忙将自己打下的麦子推成面，连着吃了七顿扁食。他这种非法的行为竟没有人管。壶关北行头群众成立了巡查委员会，登记与防止地主在平分前的偷卖浪费等破坏活动，如有地主进行破坏，除当场制止，还要在平分时和他算总帐。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 15th: Reports from various sources: The agent of U.S. monopoly capital, the American Federation of Labor (AFL), has recently encountered unanimous rejection from workers' organizations in South America in its actions to split the unity of Latin American workers. The latter pointed out the inevitable failure of this attempt. It is reported that labor confederations in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Venezuela have all refused to attend the so-called \"Pan-American Workers' Conference\" convened by the AFL in Lima, the capital of Peru, on the 10th. Peruvian workers held a powerful demonstration outside the venue when the conference opened. So far, only a small number of representatives from small trade union organizations bought off by the AFL have attended the conference. Nirega, vice chairman of the Argentine National Labor Confederation, stated when announcing the Confederation's refusal to participate that the conference convened by the AFL was an attempt to establish an anti-communist front to clear obstacles in the path of U.S. monopoly capitalism. Toledo, president of the Latin American Labor Confederation, also issued a statement condemning the AFL for doing everything possible to make the people of Latin American countries serve U.S. monopoly capital. However, Toledo emphasized that the AFL's shameful attempt would inevitably fail because \"the Latin American Labor Confederation is unprecedentedly strong.\"\n\nThe Soviet Trade Union's organ, \"Labor Newspaper,\" commented on the Lima conference, stating that the purpose of this conference was to establish a new \"Pan-American Labor Alliance\" to counter the existing Latin American Labor Confederation, which is striving to break away from the oppression of foreign capital. It also stated that the U.S. rulers are using their agents to bribe trade union corrupt elements to buy off those in the trade unions who are prepared to sell out the interests of the working class, and the AFL has set aside two million U.S. dollars for this purpose. However, the newspaper believes that the AFL's attempt to split the workers' movement, like previous attempts that have failed, will inevitably go bankrupt.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 南美劳工联盟强大　美国想分裂它碰了钉子\n\n1948-01-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　南美劳工联盟强大\n  　美国想分裂它碰了钉子\n    【新华社陕北十五日电】各方讯：美国独占资本的代理人——美国劳工联合会，最近分裂拉丁美洲工人团结的行动，遭到南美各国工人组织的一致唾弃，后者并指出此企图的必然失败。据悉，阿根廷、巴西、乌拉圭、玻利维亚、巴拉圭及委内瑞拉等国的劳工联盟，均已拒绝出席美劳联十日在秘鲁首都里马所召集的所谓“泛美职工大会”，秘鲁工人并在该会开幕时，在会场门外举行强大的示威。迄今出席该会者仅有一小撮为劳联所收买的小职工会组织的代表。阿根廷全国劳工联盟副主席尼勒加，在宣布该联盟拒绝与会时称：美国劳联所召开的这一会议，是企图建立反共阵线，以扫清美独占资本主义道路上的障碍。拉丁美洲劳工联盟主席托列达诺亦发表声明，谴责美劳联千方百计使拉丁美洲各国人民为美国独占资本服务。但托氏强调：美国劳联这一可耻企图，必然失败，因为“拉丁美洲劳工联盟已空前的强大了”。\n    苏联职工会机关报“劳动报”在评论里马会议时指出：这个会议的目的，在于建立一个新的“泛美劳工联盟，以对抗现存的并努力为摆脱外国资本压迫而奋斗的拉丁美洲劳工联盟。又称：美国统治者正利用其代理人以贿赂职工会腐化分子的方法，来收买职工会中准备出卖工人阶级利益的分子，劳联已为此拿出了二百万美元。但该报认为，美国劳联这一分裂工人运动的企图，正如以前的企图之失败一样，必将趋于破产。"

On the 15th, at dusk, a general offensive was launched, and on the morning of the 16th, the entire city was liberated. In one fell swoop, the defending enemy, Chiang Kai-shek's eleven security regiments, totaling more than 8,000 men, were annihilated, and many were captured. Detailed battle results are currently being tallied. The Nanyang, Neixiang, and Deng County areas of southwestern Henan are the main bases of the counter-revolutionary landlord armed forces. Chiang Kai-shek attempted to use their \"joint village, joint county\" organizations to mutually support and defend. As a result of this battle, the counter-revolutionary landlord armed forces in southwestern Henan have suffered a devastating blow.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei Front, 19th – The Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei People's Liberation Army celebrated and congratulated their achievements during the New Year festivities. Nearly 4,000 meritorious individuals were warmly honored at large gatherings in various units. Communist Party members have generally played a leading role in the merit-making campaign. Party members accounted for 60 percent of the meritorious individuals in one unit and 65 percent in another. At the gatherings, each unit announced its achievements in the past year in combat and in mobilizing the masses. One unit participated in six campaigns in southern Shanxi, Longhai, and Pinghan within a year, annihilating 15,900 enemy troops and capturing ten senior enemy generals, including Wu Tinglin and Li Yingcai, creating a brilliant record of annihilating a large number of enemies with a single unit. The number of enemies annihilated has now exceeded the unit's original plan by three times. In combat, renowned combat heroes such as Li Buzhou and Shi Lailiang have accumulated even more merits and received glorious commendations for the fourth time. Furthermore, since crossing the Yellow River to the south three months ago, this unit has correctly implemented the Party Central Committee's call to \"hold a gun in one hand and mobilize the masses in the other.\" A total of 254,000 farmers were mobilized and helped to organize 66 village governments in 707 villages and towns. Soldier Ma Baolu is a model of propaganda and mass mobilization, and was awarded a special merit this time. Another unit annihilated more than 14,000 enemy troops within a year, capturing 173 artillery pieces and 640 machine guns of various types. One battalion of this unit alone annihilated 2,583 enemy troops throughout the year, enough for a full regiment, and the captured weapons and military supplies, after equipping a regiment, still had a surplus. In combat and work, many heroes emerged from all arms of service: such as Wang Yuntang, deputy company commander of the fourth company of a certain regiment, who was a commander; Qin Migui, a medic; Wang Zhiyuan, an artilleryman; Huo Zhibin, an engineer and demolition expert; and Guo Xiao'e, a hero of mass mobilization. Model squad leader Wang Anguo was promoted to platoon leader for his combat achievements. After the meetings, exhibitions of battle achievements and captured goods were held, and the masses crowded around rows of cannons, praising them with joy. On the day of celebrating and congratulating their achievements, the meritorious individuals wore red ribbons and flowers, and paraded on horseback or in cars. The leaders of one unit personally led the horses for the meritorious individuals, showing the supreme glory of the people's heroes. Amidst the sound of gongs and drums, the Yangko teams of each unit, together with the local masses, paid New Year's greetings to the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the meritorious individuals led the entire army in swearing an oath before the huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, raising their arms and shouting, their voices shaking the heavens. This mighty army of Mao Zedong is determined to add to its merits in 1948 and strive for even greater victories.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 反动地主武装遭致命打击　桐柏我军解放邓县歼蒋匪保安团八千\n\n1948-01-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　反动地主武装遭致命打击\n  　桐柏我军解放邓县歼蒋匪保安团八千\n    【新华社鄂豫皖前线十九日电】桐柏军区人民解放军一部，从九日以来向豫西南的邓县城进击，十五日黄昏发起总攻，十六日晨全部解放该城，一举歼灭守敌蒋匪十一个保安团共八千多人，俘获甚多，详细战果正清查中。按豫西南南阳、内乡、邓县等地区为反动地主武装的大本营，蒋匪利用其联庄、联县等组织妄图相互声援据守。经此战斗，豫西南反动地主武装已遭受致命的打击。\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十九日电】豫陕鄂人民解放军在新年狂欢中祝捷贺功，共有近四千名功臣分别在各部队大会上受到热烈的崇敬。共产党员在立功运动中普遍起了带头作用。某部党员占功臣的百分之六十，另部功臣中党员占百分之六十五。各部大会上都宣读了自己的一年战绩和发动群众成绩。某部一年内参加了晋南、陇海、平汉等六次战役，歼敌一万五千九百名，俘敌高级将领武廷麟、李英才等十名，创造了以单个部队歼灭大量敌人的光辉纪录。现歼敌人数已超过该部原定计划的三倍。在战斗中，李步周、时来亮等著名战斗英雄都功上加功，第四次接受了光荣的褒奖。又该部自渡河南征三个月来，正确的执行了党中央的号召“一手执枪，一手发动群众”，总计在七百零七个村庄城镇中，进行了发动群众，帮助组织了六十六个村政权，参加斗争的农民达二十五万四千多人。战士马保禄是宣传和发动群众的模范，这次被记了特功。另部一年内共歼敌一万四千多人，缴获各种炮一百七十三门，机枪六百四十挺，仅该部某营在全年中就歼敌二千五百八十三名，足够一个团的编制，又缴获的武器及军用品，除装备一个团外还有剩余。在战斗及工作中，各兵种都出现了很多英雄：如指挥员某团四连副连长王云堂，卫生员秦米贵，炮兵王志远，工兵爆破手霍志斌，发动群众英雄郭小峨等，模范班长王安国并因战功擢升为排长。各部会后并分别举行战绩照片展览，胜利品展览，群众拥挤在一排排的大炮前，欢欣称赞。功臣们在祝捷贺功的一天中，都披红带花，骑马或乘坐汽车游行。某部首长亲自替功臣牵马，显示出人民功臣无上的光荣。各部秧歌队在锣鼓喧天中和驻地群众一道向党中央、毛主席和朱总司令拜年，并由功臣率领全军在毛主席和朱总司令的巨幅画像前宣誓，举臂高呼，声震天地。这一支雄壮的毛泽东的队伍，决心在一九四八年中，功上加功，争取更大的胜利。"

However, the actual inspection results revealed that among the 101 so-called poor tenant women textile workers, two were women from landlord and rich peasant families and 60 were women from middle-peasant families; among the eleven so-called poor tenant group leaders, one was a feudal woman and five were middle-peasant women. The real poor tenant women still couldn't rise up, their textile difficulties were not resolved, and they couldn't get on the machines to learn weaving. In Baichan Village, Shexian Seventh District, it was even discovered that district and village cadres forcibly organized poor women to join small textile factories. At meetings for poor women, they mobilized left and right, saying how good it was to establish small factories, but they didn't care about the difficulties faced by poor women at home due to their complex lives. As a result, although the small factories were set up to \"look the part,\" the poor women were burdened by household chores, and their thinking was resistant.

They accused the fact that “feudal women lead textile work, and poor women suffer” with many painful stories.

From late August to late December in the Gregorian calendar, in four months they captured alive, killed, or wounded more than 50,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops, and captured 33 county towns. After the Gregorian New Year, they captured Sui County and Yun County west of Hankou, eliminating more than 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops. The Jianghan Military Region, which our New Fourth Army opened up during the Anti-Japanese War, has been restored, and twelve new democratic county governments have been established. The peasants in this area are also distributing land and eliminating feudalism. In the southwest corner of Henan Province, Deng County was recently captured, destroying the old nests of the landlords' forces in that area and eliminating more than 8,000 \"security guards\" who protected the landlords. This lifted a large stone slab off the peasants in that large area.\n\nThe armies led by General Chen Yi and General Chen Geng squeezed out the Chiang Kai-shek troops on the Pinghan Railway from the east and west sides before the Lunar New Year. On New Year's Day in the Gregorian calendar, Chiang Kai-shek troops sneaked into Xuchang City again, but were driven out by our army again four or five days later. Linru City west of Pinghan Road has also been taken back into our hands. In the four months before the end of the Lunar New Year, the army led by General Chen Geng captured alive, killed, or wounded more than 56,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops and captured 36 county towns. They have now gained a firm foothold in the Funiu Mountains and have established eight commissioner's offices and more than forty democratic county governments, and the masses are also distributing land and turning over a new leaf.

    "content": "Explaining the Land Law Well is Essential for Secure Production\n　　The Approach of the Fourth and Sixth District Cadre Meetings in Huguan Should Be Changed\n　　[Taihang News] After the Fourth and Sixth Districts of Huguan saw the Land Law Outline and a large number of district cadres went to study it, the village cadres' thinking became confused and uneasy. They wanted to rush to divide the land and had no heart to lead winter production. On the 9th of this month, the Sixth District convened a meeting of village chiefs, political directors, production directors, and other cadres, focusing on discussing what the current central task was. The Nan Zhang political director said, \"Now we still have to produce well and earn rice. We will divide the land next spring, and we still have to eat rice when planting in the autumn.\" The Qiaoshang political director said, \"We now have to grasp the principle of relying on hired and poor peasants, uniting with middle peasants, and overthrowing landlords to divide the land for propaganda. We are not going to divide the land immediately, but we still have to focus on leading production well and pay attention to bad guys destroying it.\" Everyone began to clarify that the current focus is still on leading winter production to make up for the deficit. The Fourth District, in order to organize strong village cadres and strengthen the leadership of winter production in various villages through mutual assistance and research methods, convened a joint meeting of village chiefs, political directors, and teachers on the 6th of this month to discuss specific matters. In the beginning, they mobilized from the aspect of \"a large deficit due to last year's poor harvest,\" arousing everyone's enthusiasm to continue leading production, and reflected on the rest and self-flow phenomena of the past few days, and formulated a twenty-day winter production plan.\n　　Since the cadres have doubts about the Land Law and express unease, the problem cannot be solved solely by guiding production. It should be explained in conjunction with the Central Bureau's letter to party members and the Land Law Outline that has been published in this newspaper. Only in this way can winter production continue. The leadership in this area should change this formalistic approach.\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 好好讲解土地法才能安心搞生产　壶关四六区干部会的作法应改变\n\n1948-01-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　好好讲解土地法才能安心搞生产\n  　壶关四六区干部会的作法应改变\n    【太行消息】壶关四、六区看到土地法大纲和大批区干部去学习后，各村干部思想上混乱不安，想赶快平分，没心领导冬季生产。六区在本月九日，召开了村长、政治主任、生产主任等干部会，着重讨论当前中心到底搞啥？南掌政治主任说：“现在还是得好好生产赚米，明春平分土地，种秋还得吃米呀。”桥上政治主任说：“咱现在掌握住依靠雇贫、团结中农、打倒地主平分土地的原则宣传，不是马上就要平分，还是好好领导生产为主，注意坏蛋破坏。”大家开始明确了当下还是领导冬产补窟窿为主。四区更为了把强的村干部组织起来，用互助研究办法，加强各村冬季生产的领导，本月六日，召开各村长、政治主任、教员联合会，具体讨论。开始，是从“去年歉收窟窿很大”这方面动员，鼓起大家继续领导生产的情绪，并纷纷对前几天的休息、自流现象作了反省，订出二十天的冬季生产计划。\n    干部既已对土地法发生怀疑，表现不安，就不能单从引导生产上来解决问题，应该结合本报已发表的中央局的告党员书，及土地法大纲进行解释，也只有这样，冬季生产才能继续进行。该地领导上应转变这种形式主义的作法才对。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者"

Former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in the Katayama Cabinet, Rikizo Hirano, and fifteen other right-wing members of the Social Democratic Party, officially announced their departure from the party on the 5th. The Liberal Party also issued a statement on the 7th, declaring its decision to join forces with Hirano and other right-wing Social Democrats in a movement against the Katayama Cabinet when the parliament reconvenes on the 21st, further destabilizing the Katayama Cabinet. This cabinet has greatly weakened the position of the Social Democratic Party in the parliament (reduced from 143 seats to 124 seats, only three more than the Liberal Party). It is reported that Rikizo Hirano is the leading figure in the Japanese feudal fascist organization \"Imperial Way Faction.\" Since Katayama dismissed him from the post of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry last November on the grounds of \"failure to cooperate with the cabinet,\" he has been plotting to organize a new conservative party and engaging in activities to overthrow the cabinet with fascist bureaucrats Shigeru Yoshida and Kijuro Shidehara of the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Tokyo dispatch: Inflation in Japan has reached an unprecedented level. At the first meeting of the \"Banknote Issuance Committee\" convened by Katayama at the end of last year, it was confirmed that the Bank of Japan has been printing an average of 10 billion yen worth of banknotes every month since last October. According to estimates by the Bank of Japan, the number of banknotes issued by the end of last December will reach 114 billion yen, nearly seven times the 31.2 billion yen at the time of Japan's surrender (note that the amount issued by the end of last June was 136 billion yen). Inflation has caused the dire consequence of skyrocketing prices.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Tokyo dispatch: One of the major Japanese war criminals, fascist warlord Hideki Tojo, has become increasingly arrogant since arriving at the Far East International Tribunal on December 26th of last year, under the protection of MacArthur. In his lengthy and absurd 60,000-word defense, he claimed that he \"did not commit any crimes,\" and even whitewashed the Japanese寇's (a derogatory term for Japanese invaders) aggression against China and the launch of the Pacific War as being of a \"self-defense\" and \"defensive\" nature. Tojo also repeatedly defended the Emperor and other Japanese war criminals. The reason why Tojo and other war criminals dare to be so arrogant is due to MacArthur's protection and indulgence. MacArthur not only delayed sentencing Tojo and others, but even gave Tojo and 24 other major war criminals a \"Japanese-style Christmas dinner\" on the eve of the trial, treating them like honored guests. It is to be noted that Hideki Tojo once held the military posts of Commander of the Kwantung Army Gendarmerie, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, and Chief of Staff. He served as Minister of the Army in the Konoe Cabinet in 1941, and later as Prime Minister. He was the planner and actual executor of the Japanese寇's (a derogatory term for Japanese invaders) aggressive wars such as the \"September 18th Incident,\" the \"July 7th Incident,\" and the Pacific War. It is also reported that, under MacArthur's reactionary measures to support the resurgence of Japanese aggressive forces, following the release of 23 major war criminals on August 30th of last year, including Yoshisuke Ayukawa (military industrial tycoon), Chikuhei Nakajima (known as the king of the Japanese aircraft industry), and Senjuro Masakio (Army General), four more war criminals have recently been unconditionally released, including Masataka Ota (member of the Japanese House of Representatives, executive director of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association, and general director of the Greater Japan Political Association) and Shozo Kawabe (Director of the Army Education General Supervision Department).\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Tokyo dispatch: The chief prosecutor of the Far East International Tribunal (representative of US imperialism), Keenan, has recommended to Washington the release of 21 major Japanese war criminals awaiting trial. These include the former Foreign Minister, Teijiro Toyoda, who was an executioner in the invasion of China (note: he was a naval admiral, Minister of Commerce and Industry in the Second Konoe Cabinet in April 1941, and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Colonial Affairs concurrently in the Third Konoe Cabinet from July to October of the same year, and Minister of Munitions in the Suzuki Cabinet from April 1945 until the surrender), the former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese寇's (a derogatory term for Japanese invaders) Combined Fleet, Sankichi Takahashi, the former Commander of the Japanese寇's (a derogatory term for Japanese invaders) North China Garrison Army, Jun Tada, and the former spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, fascist bureaucrat Eiji Amau (note: he issued the Amau Doctrine of monopolizing China on April 17, 1934). In addition, five cabinet members from the Tojo Cabinet will also be released. The Chinese people cannot tolerate the indignant anger towards the war-monger MacArthur’s reactionary policy of condoning the Japanese寇 (a derogatory term for Japanese invaders) to bring disaster to East Asia again.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Sydney dispatch: Australian correspondent in Japan, Stanley, recently published an article in the \"Sunday Sun\" here, sharply criticizing MacArthur's delay in the trial of major Japanese war criminals. The article stated that, due to adherence to procedural issues, the trial has become a ridiculous waste of time, energy, and money. Stanley pointed out that since Tojo began his self-defense and directly distributed his defense materials through his lawyers, the defense materials have become the most direct and unhidden anti-Allied, mainly anti-Soviet, propaganda. The defense lawyers and ordinary Japanese are making full use of anti-Soviet sentiment because they believe that anti-Soviet sentiment is very popular in MacArthur's headquarters. Stanley continued that since the Far East International Tribunal began its work, MacArthur has adopted a protective attitude towards Japanese war criminals. Stanley also criticized the Australian government's erroneous policy of following US imperialism on this issue in the conclusion.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美帝包庇日本战犯　把很多大头子都放掉了想叫他们再来祸害咱们\n\n1948-01-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美帝包庇日本战犯\n  　把很多大头子都放掉了想叫他们再来祸害咱们\n    【新华社陕北十五日电】东京讯：日本主要战犯之一法西斯军阀东条英机，自去年十二月二十六日抵远东国际法庭后，在麦克阿瑟庇护下，态度愈益蛮横，他在长达六万字荒谬狂妄的辩词中，自称“并未犯任何罪行”，竟把日寇进攻中国及发动太平洋战争等侵略暴行，粉饰为“自卫”“防御”性质。东条并一再为天皇及日本其他战犯狡辩。东条等战犯之所以敢于如此狂妄，实为麦克阿瑟包庇纵容所致。麦克阿瑟对东条等不仅延缓判罪，且竟于开庭前夕仍给东条等二十四名战争主犯以“日本式之圣诞晚餐”，待如贵宾。按东条英机曾任关东军宪兵司令官、关东军副参谋长、参谋长等军职，一九四一年近卫内阁时任陆相，后任首相，系“九、一八事变”、“七、七事变”、太平洋战争等日寇侵略战争之策动者，及实际执行人。另悉：在麦克阿瑟扶植日本侵略势力再起的反动措施下，继去年八月三十日释放鲇川义介（军需财阀）、中岛知久平（号称日本飞机业大王）、真崎甚三郎（陆军大将）等二十三名主要战犯之后，最近又将太田正孝（日众议院议员、翼赞政治会常务总务、大日本政治会总务）、河边正三（陆军教育总监部部长）等四名战犯无条件释放。\n    【新华社陕北十九日电】东京讯：远东国际法庭首席检察官（美帝国主义代表）季楠，已向华盛顿建议释放待审之日本主要战犯二十一名。其中包括侵华刽子手前外相丰田贞次郎（按系海军大将，一九四一年四月间任近卫二次内阁商工大臣，同年七月至十月，任近卫三次内阁外相兼拓务大臣，四五年四月至投降前，任铃木内阁军需大臣），前日寇联合舰队司令长官高桥三吉，前日寇华北驻屯军司令官多田骏，前日外务省发言人法西斯官僚天羽英二（按他曾于一九三四年四月十七日发表独占中国之天羽声明），此外东条内阁时期五名阁员亦将获释。战争贩子麦克阿瑟此种纵容日寇重行祸害东亚之反动政策，中国人民莫不对此表示不能容忍之激愤。\n    【新华社陕北十五日电】悉尼讯：澳驻日记者斯坦莱，顷于此间“星期太阳报”著文，尖锐抨击麦克阿瑟对日本主要战犯的延缓审判。文称：由于拘守程序问题，审讯变成了时间、精力和金钱可笑的浪费。斯氏指出：自从东条自行辩护并通过其辩护人直接散发辩护材料以来，该项辩护材料已成为最率直无隐的反同盟国、主要是反苏联的宣传。辩护人和一般日本人充分利用着反苏情绪，因为他们相信，反苏情绪在麦克阿瑟总部是大受欢迎的。斯氏继称：自从远东国际法庭开始工作以来，麦克阿瑟对日本战犯即采取庇护态度。斯氏在结论中亦抨击了澳洲政府对此问题采取尾随美帝国主义的错误政策。"

Ordnance workers, dockworkers, and workers from various enterprises in Taranto have held protest rallies and demonstrations. In a resolution passed at their protest rally, the ordnance workers vehemently condemned the deployment of the US Marine Corps to Italian territorial waters and the presence of US warships in Italian ports as an insult to Italian sovereignty and the national dignity of the Italian people, and as a direct act of intervention in Italian internal and foreign affairs.

A resolution passed by the city council emphasized that the stationing of the US Marine Corps in Taranto directly infringes upon Italian independence and sovereignty.

    "content": "Old Sow's Half-Day Homecoming Dream\n\nThis is a dramatically revealing account of feudalism from Rugao County, Suzhong. It has been adapted into a play. Rural theatrical troupes tour and perform it throughout the county, and it is known as a \"play within a play.\" It profoundly educates the audience to recognize how insidious and vicious the feudal forces' plot for restoration is, and how vigilance should be heightened to deal with the feudal corpses and wandering souls.\n\nOld Sow (nickname), whose real name was Wu Qikang, was a notorious feudal tyrant in Donghengjia Daiti in that county. Because he only had one line-like eye, people also called him \"Snake-eye Third Master.\" During the re-examination, he was determined to seek refuge with his relative, Wang Xueshan, the Kuomintang bandit self-defense captain, to carry out a homecoming restoration.\n\nOn October 29th, he ran all night, and at dawn, he reached the Tiger Village along the Ru (Gao) Xin (Shenggang) highway. He asked the militiaman on night watch, \"What place is this?\" When he heard the reply \"It's Tiger Village,\" he dejectedly muttered to himself, \"No good, I've been wandering all night, and I've ended up in a New Fourth Army nest!\" The militiamen vigilantly approached and comforted him, \"Master, it doesn't matter, we are the Clearing-the-Countryside Team.\" One of them pointed to a person wearing a yellow jacket and said, \"He is our deputy of the Township Team.\" Old Sow hesitated for a while and then believed them. He sat down on the ground and began to curse, \"The bandits are so bad, all my family's things have been divided up, I was just about to go to Xueshan, you have to help me get revenge!\" The militiamen heard this and determined that he was a reactionary landlord trying to defect to the enemy. They further inquired about his name and address, politely invited him to eat, and at the same time told him that Captain Wang (referring to Wang Xueshan) had set off to clear the countryside to the west today. At this time, another militiaman hurried to Donghengjia Daiti to tell the instructor and Village Chief Wang about the whole situation. Donghengjia Daiti was immediately disguised as a Kuomintang bandit \"Encirclement and Suppression Headquarters\" and the whole village was placed under martial law.\n\nBefore long, four young men dressed as township team members ran to Old Sow breathlessly and reported, \"Master! Captain Wang and Platoon Leader Lu are sweeping Donghengjia Daiti and Jiulongkou today. The bandit army's township instructor, village chief, and the common people have not escaped. Captain Wang specially ordered us to take you back to be the Bao head.\" After hearing this, Old Sow tucked his dry tobacco pipe and took two steps at a time to run towards his home, cursing as he ran, \"Damn it, when I get my way, we'll see who struggles against whom!\" Upon entering the village, he saw things piled up in front of the village chief's door, and he said harshly, \"If anyone loses even a little bit of my stuff, see how they get away with it!\" Running further, he saw his piglets crawling out of the grass, and he gritted his teeth and said, \"Whoever touches a single pig hair of mine, I will have their life!\" Walking into the \"headquarters,\" a tall man stood up with a smile to greet him, \"Old Wang is here, do you recognize me!\" Old Sow said, \"Sir, I don't recognize you.\" The fake Clearing-the-Countryside team member immediately introduced him, \"That's Platoon Leader Lu, also the Head of the Township.\" The two then ordered, \"Now that Old Wang is here, bring the prisoners up for trial!\" At this time, the news spread throughout the village, and more than two hundred people excitedly gathered to \"watch the play.\" They all stood outside the door in silence, exchanging glances.\n\nThe first to be brought up was the village chief and the instructor. To make sure that the crowd outside the door could hear more clearly, Platoon Leader Lu said to Old Sow, \"My ears have been deafened by artillery fire, you have to speak louder for me to hear.\" Old Sow repeatedly agreed. When he saw the bound instructor, he said fiercely, \"He is the instructor, his people are extremely fierce, and he also has a box cannon (actually, he doesn't).\" Platoon Leader Lu instructed the soldiers to take him (referring to the instructor) into the room and give him a beating! Old Sow was very pleased, \"So you recognize me now, will you divide the land and distribute things again!\" When they were pretending to beat two female comrades in the room, Old Sow heard that the sound was not right. He asked from outside, \"This is not the sound of hitting flesh!\" Platoon Leader Lu pretended to be angry and scolded the executing soldiers a few times, and then really hit a few times. Old Sow nodded when he heard this and said, \"That's right!\" He completely believed it.\n\nPlatoon Leader Lu then asked who else in the village were bad people. Old Sow jumped in and said, \"There are many, many, the militiamen, women, and Grandma Ma Si are the worst.\" He immediately grabbed Grandma Ma Si, made her kneel down, and said with an insulting and self-satisfied air, \"You divided my two pieces of clothing and wore them, twisting your hips on the road. Now, you can lead the women to ask me for foreign money!\" When Platoon Leader Lu asked how to deal with these \"vicious people,\" Old Sow said with a murderous aura, \"The instructor and Grandma Ma Si should be killed with knives, the township chief and village chief should be spared a whole corpse and buried alive; the remaining dozen or so militiamen should be given a little bit of suffering before being shot!\" The crowd outside the door were all sticking out their tongues.\n\nTalking about the village's security issues, Platoon Leader Lu asked Old Sow to be the Bao head. He said, \"I am too old and illiterate, why not let my eldest son be the deputy Bao head and my nephew be the Bao head.\" Platoon Leader Lu expressed his respect for his opinion. Then he turned around to flatter Lu, saying, \"You National Army troops have worked hard, we should also collect some donations and get a few fat pigs to reward you.\"\n\nOld Sow, having gained power, immediately convened a village meeting to prepare for formal executions and to reward the \"National Army.\" At this time, Platoon Leader Lu suddenly removed his disguise and said to Old Sow, \"Take a closer look, who am I? I am not the Kuomintang bandit's Platoon Leader Lu, I am the one sent by the Democratic District Government...\" This shock was extraordinary, scaring Old Sow until his eyes stared straight ahead. The militiamen rushed forward and tied him up. Grandma Ma Si pointed at him and cursed, \"You are so vicious. You acted as a fake homecoming corps for half a day and acted so powerful. If you really defected to the Kuomintang bandits, wouldn't you want to wipe out the entire village?\" An uproar of beatings resounded from the angry crowd, and some shouted loudly, \"The frog wants life and the snake wants to run away, leaving him will be the end of us!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 老母猪半天还乡梦\n\n1948-01-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　老母猪半天还乡梦\n    这是苏中如皋县一个富有戏剧性的暴露封建面目的纪事。已编为剧本。为农村剧团轮回在全县各地演出，有“戏中戏”之称。它深刻地教育了观众认识封建势力的复辟阴谋是如何的狠毒险恶，应该如何提高警惕，来对付封建僵尸和游魂。\n    老母猪（绰号）原名吴启康，是该县东横家埭一个封建大恶霸。由于他只有一条线样的独眼，人们又称他“蛇眼三爷”。复查中，他一心想投靠到亲戚蒋匪自卫中队长王学山那里去进行还乡复辟。\n    十月廿九日，他跑了一夜，天刚亮，摸到靠如（皋）新（生港）公路的老虎庄，碰到看夜的民兵，他问：“这是什么地方？”当听到回答“是老虎庄”时，他丧气地自语：“不好，摸了一夜，又摸到新四军窝里来了！”民兵们机警地走近去安慰他：“老爷，不碍事，我们是清乡队。”一面指着一个穿黄袄子的说：“他就是我们的乡队附。”老母猪犹豫了一会，就相信了。往地下一坐就骂了起来：“土匪多坏呀，我家的东西都被分光了，我正想上学山那里去，你们要帮我报仇呀！”民兵们一听断定是反动地主想投敌，并进而请教他的姓名和住址，客气地招待他吃饭，同时告诉他王队长（指王学山）今天出发向西清乡去了。这时另一个民兵忙跑到东横家埭，将全部情形告诉了指导员和王村长，东横家埭便立即被化装成一个蒋匪的“清剿营部”全庄戒严。\n    不一会，四个扮装乡队员的青年，气喘喘地跑去向老母猪报告：“老爷！王队长卢区队附今天扫荡东横家埭九龙口，匪军的乡指导员、村长、老百姓一个也没有跑掉。王队长特叫我们来接你老人家回去当保长”。老母猪听罢，旱烟杆一夹，就三步作两步的跟着来人向家奔，一面跑来一面骂：“入妈妈的，我得了势，看是谁斗争谁呀！”一进庄，看见村长门口摆满了东西，他手一横说：“那个少掉了我一点东西，看他怎么过关！”再跑跑看见他的猪子从草里钻出来时，他咬牙切齿地说：“谁动了我一根猪毛，我要他偿命！”走进“营部”，一个高个子起身笑脸相迎：“老王来了，你可认识我！”老母猪说：“先生我不认识。”假清乡队员马上介绍说：“卢区队附那是绞乡长。”二人便命令说：“既然老王来了，把犯人带上来审吧！”这时消息传遍了全庄，二百余群众兴奋地集合起来“看排戏去”，他们都一声不响地互相丢着眼色站在门外。\n    第一个被带上的是村长和指导员。为使门外群众听得更清楚一些卢区队附对老母猪说：“我的耳朵被炮击震聋了，你说话要高点才听得见。”老母猪连连称是，他一见被绑的指导员，就狠声地说：“他就是指导员，他门人顶凶，他还有支盒子枪（其实是没有）。”卢区队附吩咐士兵把他（指指导员）关到房内去，给他一顿毒打！”老母猪很得意：“你今朝认得我啦，你会分田分东西啦！”当在房内正假装打两个女同志时，老母猪听出响声不对，他在外面发问：“这不是打在肉上的声音呀！”卢区队附故作怒容，把执刑的士兵骂了几句，里面真的打了几下。老母猪一听点点头说：“这倒不错！”便深信不疑了。\n    卢区队附再问庄上还有那些坏人，老母猪抢着说：“多徕多徕，民兵妇女还有马四奶奶顶坏。”立即将马四奶奶抓来跪下，老母猪使着侮辱而自鸣得意的神气说：“割分了我两件衣裳还穿在身上扭呀扭的屁股不在路上。今朝你可领着妇女向我要洋钱啦！”当卢区队附问怎样处置这些“狠人”时，老母猪杀气腾腾地说：“指导员、马四奶奶两个要刀杀，乡长村长饶他得个全尸活窑；其余十几个民兵，把点苦给他们吃了再枪毙！”门外的群众听了，个个舌头直伸。\n    谈到村里治安问题，卢区队附叫老母猪当保长，他说：“我年纪太大了，又不识字，不如叫我大儿子做副保长，叫我侄儿做正保长。”卢区队附表示尊重他的意见。于是他又转过来拍卢的马屁，他说：“你们国军都辛苦了，我们也要收点捐弄几只肥猪来慰劳你们。”\n    老母猪得了势立即召开村民大会准备正式开刀并慰劳“国军”。此时卢区队附骤然卸了伪装对老母猪说：“你再仔细看看，我是谁？我不是蒋匪的什么卢区队附，我是民主区政府里派来的………”这一惊非同小可，把老母猪吓得眼睛直瞪，民兵一拥而上将他绑起，马四奶奶指着他骂道：“你好毒呀，你当了半天假还乡团，就这样威风，要是你真的投靠了蒋匪，全庄的人你还不都想灭掉？”愤怒的人群里响起一阵打声，有的则大声说：“田鸡要命蛇要跑，留下他还有我们！”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Moscow Dispatch: Pravda recently published an article by reporter Isakov on his impressions of traveling in Britain, stating in brief: London is now like a person suffering from a long-term and dangerous illness that cannot be cured. \"These days are so hard!\"—this is what you can hear everywhere, whether in hotels, restaurants, subways, or on the streets. Moreover, when the British say this, they always look disheartened and disappointed. The war ended long ago, but wartime restrictions are constantly being tightened. The British people's indignation at the arrogance of \"dollar diplomacy\" is growing, and anti-American sentiment is very strong. Any anti-American remarks are sure to be met with approval at gatherings or meetings. The current new slogan is \"export campaign,\" with the aim of increasing British exports to 160% of pre-war levels by the end of 1948, but it is unclear how they will achieve this goal. Britain has reached an economically \"dead end.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: London Dispatch: The New Year of 1948 has long passed, but the Labor government's usual \"economic outlook\" for the coming year has been hesitant and delayed, and they dare not publish it. A Financial Times reporter stated: The delay in publishing the 1948 economic outlook is \"due to the volatile situation caused by the Marshall Plan.\" A Daily Worker reporter also pointed out this reason, saying: This is because \"the prospect of obtaining US dollars according to the Marshall Plan is not yet certain.\" Moreover, the rumor that the Marshall Plan is forcing Britain to limit the development of its shipbuilding industry is causing panic in British shipbuilding circles. The crisis that began last August has already caused Britain to lose £400 million in gold reserves. Rust wrote in the Daily Worker a few days ago: In the current relationship between Britain and the United States, \"no matter how much British production increases, it will still encounter a dollar deficit of £300 million per year. This autumn, Britain will not be able to pay for what it buys in the world.\" Therefore, \"unless there is a fundamental change in government policy, Britain will live under American rule, currency will inflate further, prices will rise higher, unemployment will increase even more, and all of this will greatly reduce the living standards of the British people; thus, this year will be the darkest year.\" It is precisely this dark prospect that is the fundamental reason why the Labor government dares not publish the \"outlook.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “这日子好难过呵！”　英人愤恨“美元外交”\n\n1948-01-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“这日子好难过呵！”\n  　英人愤恨“美元外交”\n    【新华社陕北十四日电】莫斯科讯：真理报顷发表记者伊萨科夫谈旅英印象一文，略称：伦敦现在象一个已患长期危险病症而无法复原的人。“这日子好难过呵！”——这是你不论在旅馆、餐厅、地下道和大街上……到处都可听到的话。并且，当英国人说这句话时，样子总是灰心失望的。战争是早就过去了，但是战时的限制却不断加紧。对“美元外交”的骄横，英国人民的愤慨正与日俱增，反美情绪十分强烈，任何反美言论，在集会上或会议中都一定遇到赞同。目前的新口号是“输出运动”，目的是到一九四八年底提高英国输出至战前的百分之一六○，但是不明白他们怎样达到这个目的。英国已走到经济上“此路不通”的境地了。\n    【新华社陕北十四日电】伦敦讯：一九四八年新年早经过去，而工党政府往年照例要发表的来年“经济展望”，却踌躇拖延，不敢发表。财政时报访员称：一九四八年经济展望之迟不发表，是“由于马歇尔计划所产生的变化无常的情况所致。”工人日报访员指出这一原因时亦称：这是因为“按照马歇尔计划获取美金的前途，尚未一定”。而马歇尔计划强迫英国限制造船业发展的传说，正使英国船业界惶惶不安。去年八月开始的危机，已使英国金准备丧失了四亿镑。鲁斯特日前在工人日报上著文称：在英美目前关系中，“英国的生产不论提高多少，它都要遇到每年三亿镑的美元亦字。今年秋季，英国将不能偿付其在世界上购买的东西。”因此，“除非政府政策有根本的改变，英国将在美国统治下过活，通货将更加膨胀，物价将更高，失业将更增加，这一切将大大降低英国人民的生活水平；这样，今年将是最黑暗的一年。”正是这种黑暗远景，成为工党政府不敢发表“展望”的基本原因。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-21",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency\n　　Over the past week, news has come of the further upsurge of democratic forces in the Far East, and news has come of the European people fiercely resisting the Marshall Plan of enslavement. At the same time, people have also seen how frightened and weak American imperialism appears under the counterattack of the people of the world.\n　　In the Far East, the Indonesian people continue to persist in the national liberation war, stubbornly and painfully striking the Dutch aggressor troops on various battlefields. A movement against the Dutch imperialist conspiracy of division is rising throughout the country. In areas occupied by the Dutch, such as Bandung, people are risking their lives to hold demonstrations everywhere, shouting, \"Dutch aggressors get out of our city!\" \"Down with the traitors!\" The firm voice of Indonesian Communist Party Secretary Daweiman, calling on the 70 million Indonesian people to unite and fight to the end, has spread throughout the country. Daweiman clearly pointed out the future of the Indonesian people's inevitable victory and the Dutch imperialists' inevitable defeat. This firm belief and this call will surely inspire the Indonesian people to carry out a more heroic struggle. At the same time, the Philippine People's Liberation Army responded to the shameless ultimatum of Philippine traitor Roxas for \"unconditional surrender\" with a wider range of attacks, and its area of activity has extended to within only thirty kilometers of Manila. Tarak, the leader of the People's Liberation Army, stated in a statement his determination to fight until Roxas surrenders. According to last week's news, the Burmese Communist Party has established democratic regimes in central Burma and other places, and insists on the armed struggle for the independence and liberation of the Burmese people. All of this, together with the comprehensive victorious offensive of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, marks the struggle of the people of the Far East against imperialism and feudalism, which is developing on an unprecedented scale.\n　　Faced with this situation, American imperialism is greatly frightened and uneasy. Now American imperialism is desperately transfusing blood to the Netherlands, and new US-Dutch loan negotiations are underway in Washington. At the same time, American imperialism is tightening its protection of Japanese fascists. War-monger MacArthur is supporting the underground fascist government of Japanese warlords, preparing to make a comeback. The Far East Economic Subcommittee under American control has also decided to increase Japan's steel production. After releasing major war criminals such as Yoshisuke Ayukawa and Chikuhei Nakajima, Kinan, the prosecutor of the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal, proposed to release more than 20 major war criminals. This move exposed before the people of the world how ugly, how isolated, and how weak American imperialism is, so that in order to vainly attempt to stop the further upsurge of the Far Eastern people's liberation movement, they have had to employ these Japanese war criminals who are deeply hated by the people.\n　　In Europe, the struggle against the Marshall Plan, directly and indirectly, is unfolding and deepening universally. In Italy, the Sixth Congress of the Italian Communist Party announced its victorious conclusion under the powerful call to strengthen the unity of the working class, expose the conspiracy of war-mongers, and resolutely resist the provocations of American imperialism and its running dogs against the Italian people. Under the leadership of the Italian Communist Party, the Italian people's movement is increasingly powerfully impacting the Gasperi regime, which is pinning its last hope on the Marshall Plan. In places such as Piacenza, Verona, Visaro, and Gala Sarro, farmers and agricultural workers demanding land reform overcame police suppression, occupied the land of landlords, and organized their own management institutions - land committees. All this shows that the new high tide of Italian democracy against imperialism has sufficient conditions and a solid foundation to move towards victory.\n　　In France, represented by aircraft industry workers and textile workers who are facing the pain of work stoppages and unemployment due to being threatened by the Marshall Plan, they continue to resolutely resist this enslavement plan, and have gained the participation of farmers. The French Communist Party convened a meeting of farmer representatives, angrily protesting the Schumann government's treasonous \"Franco-American Bilateral Agreement\" and the harmful heavy tax policies. The fact that French farmers have risen up to fight against enslavement and for democratic freedom is an important feature and noteworthy trend of the deepening French people's movement.\n　　In Germany, which is the center of the Marshall Plan, the American and British occupation authorities' conspiracy to split the country by deciding to establish a West German puppet government at the Frankfurt Conference has been unanimously denounced by the German people. The people's movement demanding democratic reunification of Germany is flourishing, and the anti-hunger strike wave sweeping the British occupation zone and spreading to the American occupation zone proves that the workers in western Germany have already begun to generally rise up to struggle under the mobilization of the German Communist Party's slogan of \"No work without food.\" This is an important part of the German democratic independence movement, and it will also be a powerful factor in promoting the final failure of the Marshall Plan.\n　　The disastrous \"Marshall Plan\" has also been resisted by the broad masses of the people in the United States. Even the reactionary New York Times has had to admit: \"The people of the American Midwest have expressed opposition to the Marshall Plan.\"\n　　On the other hand, the US Congress is endlessly discussing the \"Marshall Plan\" and has encountered many difficulties. Even many reactionary Republican and Democratic congressmen have expressed doubts, or dare not openly support it, or have even expressed opposition. According to Republican reactionary leader Vandenberg's announcement on the 6th, the figure of \"17 billion US dollars\" originally stipulated for aid to Europe under the Marshall Plan is to be cancelled. The semi-official US news agency even reported that Vandenberg had even suggested that the four-year Marshall Plan would not be discussed in Congress. The British Worker's Daily commented on this: \"The promise of Marshall's 'four-year aid' is now gradually turning into zero.\" This at least shows that the so-called Marshall's four-year aid plan has the possibility of miscarriage. The reason why the Marshall Plan has encountered such resistance in the US Congress is mainly because this plan has been opposed by the broad masses of the people inside and outside the United States. Even the reactionary newspapers of Western European countries such as Britain, Denmark, and the Netherlands have expressed anxiety and opposition because the aggressive nature of the Marshall Plan has \"become more and more obvious\" (TASS). Even Bevin, the servant of American imperialism who had actively campaigned for this, had to express some \"negative\" views due to the pressure of the British people and other reasons. Secondly, some people within the US ruling class, on the one hand, in order to win the presidential votes this year, are unwilling to be responsible for this \"loss of popular support\" plan and suffer the future punishment of the American people; on the other hand, they are afraid that this plan will throw a large amount of money into the water because of their own serious economic difficulties and fear of the \"rapidly changing situation in certain European countries\" (Labor News). In short, the future of the Marshall enslavement plan, which dreams of exchanging the enslavement of Western European countries at a small price and escaping its own economic crisis, is becoming more and more bleak.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 远东人民革命运动空前发展欧洲工农反美斗争普遍深入\n\n1948-01-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　远东人民革命运动空前发展欧洲工农反美斗争普遍深入\n    过去一周，传来了远东民主力量更加高涨的消息，传来了欧洲人民猛烈抗击马歇尔奴役计划的消息。同时，人们也看到了，在世界人民的反击下，美帝国主义表现得如何恐惧和软弱。\n    在远东，印尼人民继续坚持民族解放战争，在各战场上顽强地痛击荷兰侵略军。一个反对荷兰帝国主义分裂阴谋的运动，正在全国兴起。荷占区万隆等地的人民，冒着生命危险，到处举行示威，高喊“荷兰侵略者滚出我们的城市！”“打倒卖国贼！”全国到处传遍了印尼共产党书记达维曼号召印尼七千万人民团结一致抗战到底的坚决声音。达维曼明确地指出了印尼人民必胜与荷兰帝国主义必败的前途。这一坚定信念，这一召唤，必将鼓舞印尼人民进行更英勇的斗争。与此同时，菲律宾人民解放军以更广泛的攻击来回答菲奸罗哈斯“无条件投降”的无耻通牒，活动地区已伸展到距马尼拉仅三十公里。人民解放军领袖塔拉克在声明中，表明非打到罗哈斯投降不止的决心。另据上周消息，缅共已在缅甸中部等地成立了民主政权，坚持缅甸人民独立解放的武装斗争。这一切，配合着中国人民解放军的全面胜利进攻，标志远东人民反帝反封建的斗争，正以空前的规模发展着。\n    面对着这一形势，美帝国主义大为恐惧和不安。现在美帝国主义正拼命替荷兰输血，美荷新的贷款谈判，正在华府进行中。同时，美帝国主义更加紧卵翼日本法西斯。战争贩子麦克阿瑟正扶植日本军阀的地下法西斯政府，准备卷土重来。在美国控制下的远东经济小组委员会，亦决议增加日本钢产量。而东京战犯法庭检察长季楠继释放鲇川义介、中岛知久平等主要战犯之后，又提议释放主要战犯二十多名，这一举动，在世界人民面前暴露了美帝国主义是如此丑恶，如此孤立，如此软弱，以至为了妄图阻止远东人民解放运动的进一步高涨，他们已只好起用这些为人民所深恶痛绝的日本战犯了。\n    在欧洲，直接间接反对马歇尔计划的斗争，正普遍展开与深入中。在意大利，意共六代大会在加强工人阶级团结、揭穿战争贩子阴谋、和坚决反抗美帝国主义及其走狗对意大利人民的挑衅的强有力号召下，宣告胜利闭幕了。在意共领导下，意大利人民运动正日益有力地冲击着把最后一线希望寄托在马歇尔计划的加斯贝利政权。在配森萨、未罗那、比莎洛及加拉萨罗等地，要求土地改革的农民与农业工人，战胜了警察的镇压、占领了地主的土地，并且组织了自己的经营机构——土地委员会。这一切显示：意大利民主反帝新高潮之走向胜利，具有充分的条件和坚实的基础。\n    在法国，以受马歇尔计划威胁而面临停工失业之痛苦的飞机业工人与纺织业工人为代表，继续对这一奴役计划作坚决反抗，而且获得了农民的参加。法共召开的农民代表会议，愤怒地抗议舒曼政府卖国的“法美双边协定”与害民的重税政策。法国农民起来为反奴役和争取民主自由而斗争，这是法国人民运动日益深入的重要特征，和值得注意的动向。\n    在作为马歇尔计划中心的德国，美英占领当局在佛兰克福会议上决议成立西德傀儡政府的分裂阴谋，已受到德国人民的一致声讨，要求德国民主统一的人民运动正蓬勃展开，而席卷英占区并波及美占区的反饥饿的罢工浪潮，证明德国西部工人已经在德共“没有吃就不作工”的口号动员下，已开始普遍起来进行斗争了。这是德国民主独立运动的一个重要部分，也将是促使马歇尔计划最后失败的一个有力的因素。\n    招致灾难的“马歇尔计划”，在美国国内也遭受了广大人民的抗拒，甚至连反动的纽约时报也不得不承认：“美中西部人民对马歇尔计划表示反对。”\n    另一方面，美国国会正在哓哓不休的讨论“马歇尔计划”，而且遇到了重重困难。甚至连许多反动的共和与民主两党议员，也表示疑虑，或不敢公开支持，或竟表示反对。据共和党反动头子范登堡于六日宣布：马歇尔计划原规定援欧款项“一百七十亿美元”的数字，拟予以取销。美国半官方通讯社，甚至报导范登堡且曾建议：为期四年的马歇尔计划，将不在国会中讨论。英国工人日报曾对此评称：“马歇尔‘四年援助’之诺言，现已逐渐化成零了”。这至少已显示所谓马歇尔四年援欧计划已存在着流产的可能。马歇尔计划之所以在美国会内即遭受如此阻力，主要原因是由于这一计划遭受了美国内外广大人民的反对，甚至英国、丹麦、荷兰等西欧等国的反动报纸，也因马歇尔计划侵略性的“更益变得明显”（塔斯社）而表示忧惧而反对。即使曾为此而积极奔波的美帝国主义的从仆贝文，也在英国人民的压力等原因下，而不得不表示有些“消极”。其次，美统治阶级内部的一部分人，一方面为了争取今年的总统选票，不愿为这一“丧失民心”的计划负责，而遭受美国人民的未来惩罚；另一方面，他们因本身经济的严重困难，兼之恐惧欧洲“某些国家局势的急转直下”（劳动报），害怕这个计划会把大批金元投到水里去。总之这个梦想以少的代价来换取对西欧各国的奴役，并逃避本国的经济危机的马歇尔奴役计划，其前途的黯淡，是愈来愈明显了。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（新华社）"

However, it should be brought to everyone's attention in a timely manner: our criticism and exposure of various errors does not equate to promoting one-sidedness and exaggeration. In the past, when commendation was advocated, the news from various places was all good. Now? Everything is bad again. We believe that this is still not a pragmatic style, and doing so will develop the \"Kremlin style\" (客里空作风). We require all branch offices and correspondents to earnestly proceed from reality, to be right if it is right, and wrong if it is wrong, to be honest, not to boast, not to steal, not to feign, to promote the spirit of being responsible to the people and seeking truth from facts, to expose errors, correct errors, and promote achievements and advantages. All erroneous things, we must bravely criticize from a class standpoint. On the other hand, all good achievements that benefit the people, good work styles and models for serving the people, we must also commend. When we report on a work, we must also measure its advantages and disadvantages from the standpoint of the interests of hired and poor laborers, in order to better transform cadres and improve work.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 通讯往来　第三号\n\n1948-01-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　通讯往来\n  　第三号\n    最近各分社及通讯员努力揭发了各种工作上的错误及各种违犯人民利益的现象，是很好的；但是应当引起大家及时注意：我们批评及揭发各种错误，并不等于助长片面性和夸大，过去提倡表扬了，各地来的消息便一切都是好的。现在呢？又是一切都是坏的了。我们认为这仍然不是实事求是的作风，这样做，又会发展“客里空作风”。我们要求各分社及通讯员认真从实际出发，对是对，非是非，老老实实，不吹不偷不装，发扬对人民负责、实事求是的精神，揭发错误，纠正错误，发扬成绩和优点。一切错误的东西，我们都要站在阶级立场上勇于批判，另一方面，一切于人民有利的好成绩，为人民服务好的作风和表率，我们同样要加以表扬，我们报导一件工作，同样也要站在雇贫利益的立场上衡量其优缺点，以便更好的改造干部改进工作。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Front, 19th: The Eyuwan Military Region direct units have launched a study of Chairman Mao's report \"The Present Situation and Our Tasks.\" Various units are using breaks in combat to hold special meetings to conduct study. At the same time, in coordination with checking components, checking ideology, and reorganizing the ranks, they are mobilizing the masses in their stationed areas to carry out land reform. In the work of studying and participating in land reform, many comrades believe that understanding how to analyze rural classes from a class viewpoint is the first lesson that should be learned in doing mass work; otherwise, one will inevitably be detached from the standpoint of the poor and hired peasants. For example, the so-called landlord work and \"full jar movement\" in the past lacked clear class character. Now, the comrades of the direct units have developed a trend of actively investigating and researching, analyzing rural class relations, talking with the poor and hired peasants, and learning from them. In the past, some people often wanted to live in the good houses of landlords, but now they are willing to live in the homes of poor peasants in order to conduct investigation and research. Each work team and each unit has conducted relatively detailed investigations of the political and economic aspects of the stationed villages. A political liaison officer made a very meaningful investigation and analysis of the population, land, livestock, class relations, Chiang bandit conscription, levies, exploitation, baojia figures, and various methods of oppressing peasants in a stationed village of twenty-five households. In their recent study and land reform work, they have also realized that if each unit wants to do a good job in mass work in the stationed villages, it is impossible to rely solely on a few civilian affairs workers; the leaders must personally take action and organize all cadres and soldiers to participate in the work in order to have strength. This is a work of ideological construction for the troops, and various units are now carrying it out.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 鄂豫皖军区直属队　学习毛主席报告　结合三查参加驻村土地改革\n\n1948-01-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　鄂豫皖军区直属队\n  　学习毛主席报告\n  　结合三查参加驻村土地改革\n    【新华社鄂豫皖前线十九日电】鄂豫皖军区直属队展开学习毛主席“目前形势和我们的任务”的报告，各单位利用战斗空隙，召开专门会议，进行学习。同时，配合查成份、查思想、整编队伍，在驻地发动群众进行土地改革。在学习和参加土地改革工作中，许多同志认为懂得如何用阶级观点分析农村阶级，是做群众工作应学习的第一课，否则就必然脱离贫雇群众的立场，如过去所谓房东工作、“满缸运动”，就缺乏明确的阶级性。现在直属队的同志们，产生一种积极调查研究，分析农村阶级关系、找贫雇谈话和向贫雇学习的风气。过去有些人常想住地主的好房子，现在都愿住在贫农家里，以便进行调查研究。每个工作队和各单位，对驻村都做了比较详细的经济政治各方面的调查。有个政治协理员，曾把一个二十五户的驻村人口、土地、牲畜、阶级关系、蒋匪抓丁、派款、剥削、保甲人物、及各种各样欺压农民的办法，做了很有意义的调查和分析。他们在最近的学习和土地改革工作中，还体会到：如果各单位要把驻村群众工作作好，仅依靠少数民运工作人员是办不到的，必须首长亲自动手，把全体干部战士组织起来参加工作，才有力量。这是部队一个思想建设的工作，现在各单位正在进行。"

    "content": "【Taiyue News】According to the Changzi Masses News, the Changzi government, due to simply using administrative orders for labor徵用 without thorough inspection, caused hired poor peasants to suffer greatly from heavy labor burdens. For example, in Majian Village, Fourth District, there are 45 male full laborers and 71 half laborers. Among them, 36 male full and half laborers do not perform labor service, while 67 do. Among those who drive livestock, 13 do not perform labor service, accounting for one-third of the number of those who do. Among these, hired poor peasants bear the heaviest burden of labor service. For instance, hired poor peasant Wang Yongchang, a newly turned-over household, performed 113 days of labor service in nine months. Middle peasant Shen Chouhan performed 115 days of labor service in nine months. However, struggle target Wang Heren only performed 33 days of labor service in nine months. These three people performed a total of 261 days of labor service. The average labor service days per person should be 87 days. Poor peasant Wang Yongchang performed 26 days more, middle peasant Shen Chouhan performed 28 days more, and struggle target Wang Heren performed 54 days less. From this example, it can be seen that the labor徵用 is extremely unfair. Therefore, a mass in the First District said: \"Poor people cannot turn over no matter how hard they work. No matter how productive you are, you have to sell your land after performing labor service once.\" This kind of bureaucracy should not only be corrected quickly, but also be linked with the examination of landlord and rich peasant thought. Why does the struggle target perform so little labor service, while the peasants perform so much?\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 长子检查官僚作风　支差不公雇贫吃亏\n\n1948-01-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　长子检查官僚作风\n  　支差不公雇贫吃亏\n    【太岳消息】据长子群众报载：长子政府因为单纯用行政命令要差，不深入检查致使雇贫农支差繁重吃了大亏。如四区马箭村有男全劳力四十五个，半劳力七十一个，其中男全半劳力不支差的三十六个，支差的六十七个。赶牲口的十三个，不支差的占支差人数的三分之一，其中要算雇贫农支差最重。如雇贫农王永昌是个新翻身户，九个月中支差一百一十三天。中农申丑汉，九个月支差一百一十五天。可是斗争对象王和仁，九个月只支了三十三天。这三个人共支了二百六十一天，三人平均每人该支差八十七天，贫农王永昌就多支了二十六天，中农申丑汉多支二十八天，斗争对象王和仁少支了五十四天。从这一例子看，差务太不公平了，所以一区有个群众说：穷人多会也翻不了身，不管你怎样能生产，支一回差就得卖地了。这种官僚主义不光要很快纠正，还应当和检查地主富农思想联系起来，为什么斗争对象支差这样少，农民支差这样多。"

    "content": "[News from this newspaper] Xia Nan Street in Changzhi City, in order to implement the policy of relying on poor and hired peasants, conducted another inspection after the winter loans were distributed. Because the winter loan methods were simplistic, causing dissatisfaction among some middle peasants, the purpose of this re-examination was mainly to discover and solve the difficulties of poor and hired peasants, and also to resolve the dissatisfaction of middle peasants, so as to achieve unity between poor and middle peasants to jointly get rich. The method was to hold small street forums for middle and poor peasants, mobilizing everyone to raise difficulties and say whatever they had to say. Cheng Yushan's wife, a hired peasant, said: \"My family of six shares a tattered quilt. My husband is over sixty years old and works as a cook at the Fuxing Leather Factory, but he hasn't received any dividends for months. The corn isn't ripe yet, but we're already picking it in the fields to eat. Now I've been loaned 40,000 yuan, but I can't do anything else. I bought two sheep, planning to fatten them up and sell them to earn some money. I spin some wool every day, but with the old and the young, and the grain almost gone, I don't know what to do!\" Cheng Fengming's mother said: \"My family of ten harvested six shi of corn. My third son joined the army, and my eldest son has been sick at home for more than three months, not earning a penny, and still needing pocket money. I only have 30,000 yuan to invest, but I had to use it for medicine. This time I've been loaned 20,000 yuan, and I can only spin some wool. I'm really worried!\" Yu Youwen said: \"We, three men and six women (poor and hired peasants), were loaned a total of 160,000 yuan. We organized a new flour mill, and business is okay, but no one knows how to keep accounts, which is a worry.\" Guo Suoze's mother said: \"We, eight households (hired and poor peasants), were loaned a total of 250,000 yuan. There is only one laborer over fifty years old, and he's also sick. The street cadres helped invest the 250,000 yuan in the Tongshun Flour Mill in this street. But we're afraid of losing money. We only dare to see profits, not losses, because if we lose, we'll be in trouble. Since borrowing the money, I can't even sleep.\" Shen Sanhai said: \"I'm a new middle peasant, but Yu Genzhi (Director of Civil Affairs) made me a former middle peasant and wouldn't give me a loan. What's my class status anyway?\" Shen Mami said: \"It's not just that they didn't give me a loan, but why did they classify me, a hired peasant, as a former middle peasant?\" Li Pihai, Liu Changfa, Cheng Zhi, Pei Fugui, and Shen Heqi are five households of hired peasants who all need loans but didn't get them. After the problems were discovered, the cadres and the Winter Loan Committee studied the matter and decided that eleven households of hired peasants, including Pei Fugui, needed 190,000 yuan in loans, which would be resolved by the street credit cooperative, with the same interest rate as the winter loans. Cheng Yushan (the most disadvantaged person in the entire street) was lent two shi of corn and a quilt from the poor people's association's grain reserves. Cheng Fengming (the second most disadvantaged hired peasant in the entire street) was lent one shi and five dou of corn. The street cadres also helped Yu Youwen's group hire the manager and accountant of the Tonghe Flour Mill to help with writing and calculating production accounts, investing loans for the widowed and orphaned in various production departments to ensure profits. The problems raised by the hired peasants have now been resolved separately. (Changzhi City Guide)\n\nThe survey on the situation after the loans to poor and hired peasants in Xia Nan Street, Changzhi City, is very good, but there are two points to consider regarding the solutions adopted after the survey: First, are the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants being solved by cadres and the Winter Loan Committee increasing loans, lending grain, and finding a literate person, or is it a top-down, paternalistic approach? The better approach should be to mobilize the poor and hired peasants themselves to solve the problems. If it's only handled by the higher-ups and village cadres, it will definitely be difficult. Second, why are the village cadres arbitrarily changing class status? The masses have raised this issue and it should be resolved.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 长治市下南街贫雇没发动　贷了款没法生产\n\n1948-01-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　长治市下南街贫雇没发动\n  　贷了款没法生产\n    【本报消息】长治市下南街为了贯彻雇贫路线，在冬贷发放后，又进行了一次检查。因冬贷方式上简单，曾引起了中农阶层一部分人的不满，所以这次再查目的，主要是发现与解决雇贫困难，同时也解决中农不满思想，达到贫中团结共同闹发家。在方法上：是分小街召开中贫座谈会，动员大家提困难，有啥说啥。雇贫程玉山妻说：我家六口人，伙盖一条破被子，男人六十多岁，在复兴皮革工厂做饭，几个月啦也分不上个红利，玉茭没黄熟，就在地里挑着吃，现在给我贷了四万元，别的不能干，我买了两只羊，喂胖卖了打算赚几个钱。我是每天纺些毛，老的老，小的小，粮食快完啦！怎样也没法。程凤鸣娘说：我家十口人，收六石玉茭，三儿子参军，大儿子在家病了三月多，一个钱赚不上，还要零花，只有三万块投资，因吃药也抽来花了，这次给我贷两万块钱，我只能纺些毛，真是发愁呀！于友文说：我们三个男人，六个妇女（贫雇），共贷十六万块钱，新组织一个面坊，买卖也还可以，就是没一人会写帐发愁的很。郭锁则娘说：我们八户（雇贫），共贷款二十五万，只有一个五十多岁劳力，还有病，街干部帮助把二十五万块钱投到本街同顺面坊。可不敢教赔了钱，只敢见红，不敢见黑，赔了可没法，自贷上款，我连觉也睡不着。沈三孩说：我是个新中农，俞根之（民政主任）把我弄成旧中农，不让我贷款，我到底是个啥成份。申马迷说：不贷给款不说，为啥把我雇贫划成旧中农？李皮孩、刘常法、程枝的、裴富桂、沈和气等五户都是雇贫，都需贷款，没贷上。问题发现后，经干部和冬贷委会研究，裴富桂等十一户雇贫，需要贷款十九万，由本街信用合作社负责解决，利息和冬贷一样。程玉山（全街最困难者）由贫民会存粮中借给玉茭两石，被子一条。程凤鸣（全街二等困难雇贫）借给玉茭一石五斗。街干部并帮助于友文组，聘请同和面坊经理、会计帮助写算生产帐目，孤寡贷款，投资各生产部，保证赚钱，雇贫提出的问题，现都分别解决了。（长市导报）\n    长治市下南街对贫雇贷款后的情况作了调查很好，但调查后所采取的解决办法则有两点要考虑：第一、贫雇的困难是由干部和冬季贷委员会增发贷款、借给粮食、找个识字人等办法来解决，还是一种自上而下的包办办法，较好的办法应该是发动贫雇自己起来解决，单由上边办，村干部办，事情就一定难办好。第二、村干乱划成份，为什么？群众提出来了，应该解决才对。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 18th: The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, in order to correct the serious phenomenon in various localities of indiscriminately providing preferential treatment to military, martyr, and worker dependents regardless of their wealth, increasing the burden on peasants, and creating a situation where the lives of cadres' family members are special and detached from the masses; and regarding the handling of demobilized soldiers, has made the following decisions: (1) All poor military, martyr, and worker dependents and themselves should be allocated a share of land, livestock, farm tools, grain, and other property in accordance with the principle of equal distribution of land. The widowed, orphaned, and childless elderly should be taken care of with the consent of the masses, helping them to lay the foundation for establishing a household and achieving self-sufficiency in production. (2) All material preferential treatment for worker dependents should be stopped (extremely poor and weak worker dependents who cannot maintain their lives for the time being should be given appropriate relief). (3) Military and martyr dependents who are middle peasants or above will not be given any material preferential treatment. (4) Poor military and martyr dependents who have labor power will also not be given material preferential treatment after they have obtained land and means of production in the land reform. Those who lack labor power may be given assistance with labor or plowing, and subsidies for firewood, etc., but this must be reviewed and evaluated by the village poor peasant leagues or peasant congresses and reported to the county government for unified implementation. (5) Poor demobilized soldiers who have not settled down should be given consideration by the masses when distributing land and property in the land reform. Disabled and demobilized soldiers who have been resettled in rural areas over the years should be reviewed by the masses. Good ones should be commended, and those who oppress the masses should be educated by the masses, and even have their disability certificates or demobilization certificates confiscated, and all preferential treatment they should enjoy should be revoked. (6) Poor military and martyr dependents and disabled or demobilized soldiers who are actively engaged in production and have good relations with the masses should be given more encouragement and comfort in politics and spirit.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northeast, 18th: The Delegates' Conference of Honored Soldiers here opened on December 22nd of last year and closed on the 5th of this month. A total of 2,049 delegates and responsible personnel from provinces, military regions, and counties in charge of managing honored soldiers attended the meeting. The honored soldier delegates received a warm welcome and respect. Frontline troops sent telegrams of condolence one after another. Workers, shop assistants, students, and representatives of various agencies in Harbin jointly presented flags and慰问品 to them. Luo Ronghuan, Deputy Political Commissar of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, and Lin Feng and Gao Chongmin, Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Northeast Political Committee, respectively, attended and delivered speeches. Comrade Zhou Huan, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, conveyed the \"Decision on Handling Honored Soldiers,\" and then group meetings were held, and everyone reflected deeply in connection with themselves and launched debates. Because the spirit of criticism and self-criticism was brought into play, the meeting achieved two important gains: First, it corrected the one-sided emphasis of many delegates on the shortcomings of the local work on honored soldiers, while neglecting the examination of their own thoughts, such as the interference in the peasant struggle, beating and scolding people, selling public property, and not being content with work that occurred among some honored soldiers. Everyone expressed that they would strictly abide by government decrees and military discipline, support the peasant struggle, actively participate in various tasks, those who can go to the front will return to the front, and those who cannot go to the front will actively participate in production and work in the rear, and strive to support the front. Second, comrades in charge of managing honored soldiers in various provinces, military regions, and counties also made strict self-criticisms, such as the bureaucratic and irresponsible attitude in handling the work of honored soldiers. After days of discussion, the honored soldier representatives of various provinces signed the \"Honored Soldier Competition Treaty,\" and on the 5th, the \"Decision of the Honored Soldier Delegates' Conference\" was unanimously adopted. It was also decided that in the old lunar New Year, each province would convene a delegates' conference of honored soldiers to convey the decisions of this conference and conduct a comprehensive rectification of thought and discipline. Comrade Zhou Huan said at the closing ceremony: In the future, honored soldiers in the localities should be supervised by the poor and hired peasants, and the peasant associations can review the honored soldiers regularly. Finally, the conference unanimously passed a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, expressing that they would abide by the revolutionary discipline of honored soldiers, and determined to continue to exert their strength, take on various jobs, and do their best to support the front, so as to strive for the early arrival of victory.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陕甘宁边区决定　优待军烈属新办法　一切按土地法办事\n\n1948-01-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　陕甘宁边区决定\n  　优待军烈属新办法\n  　一切按土地法办事\n    【新华社西北十八日电】陕甘宁边区政府为纠正各地对军烈工属不分贫富，一律优待，加重农民负担，形成干部家属生活特殊与脱离群众的严重现象；及对退伍军人的处理，特作如下决定：（一）所有贫苦军、烈、工属及其本人在平分土地的原则下，均应分得一份土地及牲畜农具粮食等财物，对于鳏寡孤独者应经过群众同意加以照顾，帮助其打下建立家务的基础，达到生产自给。（二）一律停止对工属之物质优待（十分贫穷一时不能维持生活之老弱工属酌予救济）。（三）凡系中农以上阶层之军、烈属一律不予物质优待。（四）凡有劳动力之贫苦军、烈属在土地改革中得到土地及生产资料后亦不予物质优待。缺乏劳动力者，可酌予帮工或代耕及补助柴火等，但须经各村贫农团或农民大会审查评定，报告县政府统一实行。（五）没有安家立业的贫苦退伍军人，在土地改革中分配土地和财物时，应经过群众给以照顾，历年安置在农村的残废和退伍军人均应经群众审查，好的予以表扬，欺压群众的交群众教育，甚至没收其残废证或退伍证，取消其应享之一切优待。（六）对于贫苦军、烈属和积极生产对群众关系好的残废或退伍军人，在政治上精神上应多予鼓励和安慰。\n    【新华社东北十八日电】此间荣誉军人代表大会在去年十二月廿二日开幕，到本月五日闭幕。到会代表及各省、军区和县负责管理荣军的工作人员共二千零四十九人。荣军代表们受到了热烈的欢迎和尊敬。前方部队纷纷来电慰问。哈市工人、店员、学生与各机关代表联合向他们献旗赠送慰劳品。东北解放军副政委罗荣桓，东北政委会正副主席林枫、高崇民等均出席致词。东北解放军政治部副主任周桓同志传达“关于处理荣誉军人决定”后，即分开小组会，大家联系自己深刻反省，展开争论。由于发挥了批评与自我批评的精神，使会议得到两个重要收获：一是纠正了许多代表片面强调地方上对荣军工作的缺点，而忽略了对自己思想的检查，如某些荣军中发生的干涉农民斗争，打人骂人，变卖公物，不安心工作等。大家都表示今后一定严守政府法令和军队纪律，支持农民斗争，积极参加各种工作，能上前方的重返前线，不能上前方的，则积极参加后方生产和工作，努力支援前线。二是各省、军区和县管理荣军工作的同志也作了严格的自我检讨，如对处理荣军工作存在着的官僚主义和不负责任的态度等。经过连日讨论，各省荣军代表们签订了“荣军竞赛条约”，五日全体一致通过“荣军代表大会决定”。并决定在旧历年关，各省召开荣军代表大会，传达此次大会的决定，普遍的整顿思想和纪律。周桓同志在闭幕大会上说：今后荣军在地方上要受贫雇农的监督，农会可以定期的审查荣军。最后大会一致通过致电毛主席、朱总司令，表示今后决遵守荣誉军人的革命纪律，决心继续发挥力量，走上各种工作岗位，尽力支援前线，以争取胜利的早日到来。"

    "content": "Li Cheng Holds a Poor and Lower-Middle Peasant Forum to Discuss the Correct Interpretation of the Land Law\n\n　　[Li Cheng News] Li Cheng held a forum for poor and lower-middle, honest peasants in the county on the 7th of this month to study winter production and the Land Law and to solicit their opinions. First, the leaders mobilized the participants, asking them to boldly expose problems without worrying about repercussions, guaranteeing that \"village cadres will not retaliate.\" After guidance and mobilization, the concerns were broken down. The problems they reflected were: In terms of loans: Shang Huangtang loaned 530,000 yuan, and one landlord borrowed 430,000 yuan. Xi Luotuo loaned 200,000 yuan, which the village chief and the finance director \"borrowed\" completely. Some village cadres used the excuse that the loans could not be repaid after the due date and refused to lend to poor and hired peasants. In organizing winter production for middle peasants, they looked down on poor and hired peasants. The village chief of ×× reluctantly asked a poor and hired peasant to be the manager of the cooperative, but did not provide specific help. As a result, the manager carried water in the cooperative for one day and couldn't bear it anymore. The poor and hired peasants of ×× village spontaneously organized, but the cadres said, \"This is a special agent activity,\" scaring the masses so they didn't dare to continue. Fifty mu of poor and hired peasant loans, the cadres said were speculation, raising the interest rate, scaring the masses so they didn't dare to borrow. In Chengjiashan, a hundred households opened four tofu workshops, wasting the masses' lives, and the poor and hired peasants did not benefit. The response to the Land Law was: This way, we can completely turn ourselves over. As long as we work hard, we are not afraid of not being able to turn over, and we are not afraid of unequal distribution. As for giving the landlord a share, this is our magnanimity. If he takes out all his things and bows his head to us, then give him a share. When it came to the distribution of fruits last winter, everyone had more opinions. Poor and hired peasants in Shang Guihua said: \"In our village last winter, when people saw that it was poor and hired peasants entering to distribute the fruits, they would tell him to take out package number so-and-so, which were all things that our peasants couldn't use.\" Some reflected: Rich peasants acted as village deputy, not only had no door, but also distributed the fruits. We push the mill without furniture to use, but their home large dustpan, sieve are double sets. After hearing about the Land Law, not only did they not lead production, but they also incited a poor and hired peasant to deliberately borrow more to undermine unity, demanding immediate replacement. Dongguan cadres, because of problems in their own families or having distributed more fruits, even started winter school after hearing about the Land Law, planning for their own problems every day. In addition, some individuals were found to be wasteful. Finally, everyone discussed paying attention to the landlords and rich peasants who were sabotaging and disrupting, preserving the fruits and not allowing the landlords, rich peasants and bad cadres and bad party members to destroy the fruits. For those who want to take advantage in the equal distribution and deliberately waste, everyone's opinion is to explain to him: \"If you waste, when it is distributed in the future, your waste will be counted, you will still lose out.\" Explain to the middle peasants wasting: \"Middle and poor peasants are one family, what are you wasting? Those with less land will also be compensated, and those with more land will also mobilize a part to help the poor and hired peasants turn over, and family property will not move, you will still lose out.\" Resolutely do not allow landlords and rich peasants to destroy the fruits or take advantage of loopholes to distort the Land Law, and whoever destroys them will never be let go. After each poor and hired peasant returned, they immediately convened their own poor and hired peasant groups to collude. Always let the poor and hired peasants understand the Land Law and pay attention to all issues.\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Jian Xun)\n\nEditor's Opinion: The Li Cheng leadership convened a meeting of poor and hired peasants to study the Land Law together. If this method is done well, it can provide a mental preparation for the equal distribution of land in the village in the future, and clarify all rumors and distortions about the Land Law. Middle peasants can rest assured, cadres who have gained more fruits can honestly correct their mistakes, and will not violate the Land Law again. If landlords and rich peasants dare to make trouble, there will also be people to monitor them.\n\nHowever, we believe that it is good enough if this meeting can play the above-mentioned role. The real thorough equal distribution must rely on the mobilization of the entire class of the vast poor and hired peasants in the countryside, and select leaders who are recognized by the peasants themselves from the struggle. Never take the \"active element route\" of a few people again. We only have one route, that is, the one stipulated by the Land Conference: Relying on poor and hired peasants, rural workers and all landless and land-poor peasants, and consolidating the union of middle peasants. Establish poor peasant groups, peasant associations, and peasant representative conferences to defeat the resistance of landlords and rich peasants. Therefore, the Li Cheng poor and hired peasant meeting should only be a temporary meeting convened to promote the Land Law.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 黎城召开贫雇座谈会讨论正确解释土地法\n建勋\n1948-01-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　黎城召开贫雇座谈会讨论正确解释土地法\n    【黎城消息】黎城于本月七日，召开全县贫雇老实农民座谈会，研究冬季生产与土地法，并征求他们的意见。首先领导上做了动员，要求大胆暴露，不要顾虑，保证“村干部不能报复”。经过引导动员，才打破了顾虑。他们反映出的问题有：在贷款方面：上皇堂贷款五十三万元，一个地主就贷了四十三万。西骆驼贷二十万，村长和财政主任两人即“贷”完了。有的村干部借口过期归还不了不借给雇贫。组织中农冬季生产看不起贫雇，××村长勉强叫一个贫雇到合作社当经理，也不具体帮助，结果经理到社内担了一天水，顶不住出来了。××村贫雇自动组织起来，干部却说：“这是特务活动的”，吓的群众也不敢干了。五十亩贫雇贷款，干部说是投机，提高利率，吓的群众也不敢贷了。程家山百户人家，即开了四座豆腐坊，群众生活浪费，贫雇得不到利。对土地法的反映是：这样咱们就能彻底翻透身，只要咱们好好干不怕翻不透，不怕分不公。至于对地主分得一份，这是咱们的宽大。如果他把东西全部拿出来，对我们低了头，就给他分一份。一提到去冬分果实，大家意见就更多了。上桂花贫雇说：“我村去冬分果实，人家一见是贫雇进去分，就说给他拿出第几号包袱来，里边尽是些咱们农民没用的东西。”有的反映：富农当村副，不但没门，还分了果实。咱推磨没有家具使，人家家中大簸箩、簸箕都是双套。听到土地法后不但不领导生产还挑拨一个贫雇故意多贷款来破坏团结，要求马上撤换。东关干部因自家有问题或多分了果实，一听到土地法后连冬学也上起来了，每天为自己问题打算。此外还发现有个别人浪费。最后大家讨论了注意地主、富农破坏捣乱，保存果实不让地主富农与坏干部坏党员破坏果实。对于想在平分中多占便宜便故意浪费的人，大家意见是给他解释：“你如果浪费，将来分的时候，要把你浪费的也算上，你浪费了还是你吃亏。”对中农浪费解释：“中贫农是一家，你浪费什么？地少的还要给你往起补，地多的也是动员一部来帮助贫雇翻身，家财并不动，你浪费了还是你吃亏。”对地主富农坚决不许他们破坏果实或钻空曲解土地法，谁要破坏决不放松。各个贫雇回去后即召开了自己的贫雇小组来串通。总要叫贫雇了解了土地法和注意一切问题。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（建勋）\n    编者意见：黎城领导上召集贫雇开会，一块研究土地法，这个办法如果做的好，可以给村里将来平分土地作一个思想准备，把一切有关土地法的谣言和曲解都弄清楚明白。中农可以安心，多得果实的干部可以老实改错，不致再去违犯土地法，地主富农如果敢胡闹，也有人监视他。\n    但是，我们认为这个会议能够起了上述作用就算好极了。真正的彻底平分，必须依靠乡村广大贫雇农的整个阶层的发动，从斗争中选拔农民自己公认的领袖。千万不要再走什么少数人的“积极分子路线”。我们的路线只有一个，那就是土地会规定了的：依靠贫雇农、乡村工人及一切无地少地农民，巩固的联合中农。成立贫农团、农会、农代会，来打掉地主富农的反抗。因此，黎城的贫雇会议应该只是一临时的，为了宣传土地法而召开的会议。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Moscow Radio broadcast a New Year's commentary by Masinu on the 8th, stating: The Chinese reactionary camp and the Chinese democratic camp welcomed the New Year with two completely different emotions. The reactionaries felt that their situation was completely hopeless and doomed to final failure, and expressed pessimism and disappointment. A Reuters reporter in Nanjing, summarizing his impressions, wrote: Senior officials in Nanjing are deeply convinced that the end of the Kuomintang's life is imminent. In his New Year's broadcast, Chiang Kai-shek admitted that the people supported the Communist Party, that the Kuomintang's \"general mobilization\" could not be realized, and that he was in crisis. The Chinese democratic camp, on the other hand, was full of confidence in victory due to its growing strength. An American journalist, Rhine, who had recently visited the Liberated Areas, saw this situation and specifically pointed out: Everywhere in the Liberated Areas expressed full confidence in victory. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, said in his report: \"The revolutionary war of the Chinese people has now reached a turning point.\" Masinu continued: The failure of the Chinese reactionary camp's plans and the success of the democratic camp's plans are by no means, as stated in the Reuters Nanjing reporter's dispatch, \"one of the main factors is that the current Chinese (Chiang) government has not received significant assistance from the United States.\" All facts show that since the Japanese surrender, the Kuomintang has received and continues to receive significant assistance from the United States government. This assistance has already greatly exceeded 4.4 billion US dollars, and a large number of American weapons and military supplies are constantly and increasingly being transported to the Kuomintang-controlled areas. American military advisors have moved to the Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense to work, and many American officers personally participate in the work of the Kuomintang front-line headquarters. They have provided great assistance to the reactionary army's offensive, but the result is still Chiang Kai-shek's miserable failure. Mao Zedong pointed out: The Kuomintang's military superiority and American aid are only temporary factors; while the nature of the war and the will of the people are constant factors, and the People's Liberation Army has an advantage in this regard. The experience of eighteen months of war has fully proved the correctness of this argument. Masinu concluded: This is the reason why the Chinese democratic camp is full of confidence in victory.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 一个中国两样新年　蒋介石自知必败哭丧悲观解放区人民充满胜利信心\n\n1948-01-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　一个中国两样新年\n  　蒋介石自知必败哭丧悲观解放区人民充满胜利信心\n    【新华社陕北十八日电】莫斯科电台八日广播马西努新年评论称：中国反动阵营和中国民主阵营，是怀着完全不同的两种情绪迎接了新年。反动派感到自己所处的景况完全没有出路和必然遭到最后失败，而表示悲观失望。路透社南京记者在总结自己的印象时写道：在南京的高级官员中深信国民党的寿命的终结已经是指日可待了。蒋介石在自己的新年广播中，承认人民拥护共产党，承认国民党的“总动员”不能实现，承认自己处在危机中。而中国民主阵营则对于自己日益强大的力量充满胜利信心。不久以前到过解放区的美国记者莱茵就看到了这种情形，他特别指出：在解放区到处都表示出对于胜利的充分信心。中国共产党主席毛泽东在他的报告中说：“中国人民的革命战争，现在已经达到了一个转折点”。马西努继称：中国反动阵营计划的失败，民主阵营计划的成功，绝非如上述路透社南京记者的通讯所说：“其主要因素之一是现今的中国（蒋）政府没有得到美国的重大援助”。一切事实说明，日本投降以来，国民党已得到和继续得到美国政府重大援助，这种援助过去已大大超过四十万万美元，而美国大批武器与军用物资正不断的日益增加的运往国民党统治区，美国的军事顾问们，都搬到国民党国防部去办公，许多美国军官亲自参加国民党前线司令部的工作。他们已为反动军队的进攻做了很大的援助，但其结果仍然是蒋介石的悲惨失败。毛泽东指出：国民党军事力量的优势、美国的援助，只是临时起作用的因素；而战争的性质，人心的向背，则是经常起作用的因素，人民解放军在这方面则占着优势。十八个月战争的经验，充分证明了这一个论断的正确。马西努末称：中国民主阵营所以充满胜利信心，其原因即在此。"

Those who are physically strong should return to the front lines to kill the enemy and perform meritorious service for the people; those who cannot go to the front lines can participate in work in the rear; disabled veterans who have lost their ability to work and are studying in disabled veterans' training centers should learn and participate in some handicraft labor as much as possible. In accordance with instructions from higher authorities, one thousand lightly disabled veterans will be mobilized to study at the Military and Political University and then serve as training officers in various independent regiments. The resolution then stated: All disabled veterans should actively support the peasants and protect their emancipation. A widespread and in-depth movement to examine stance, examine ideology, and rectify discipline should be carried out among disabled veterans and disabled veterans' schools to thoroughly examine shortcomings and errors in their own thinking, actions, and lives, and eliminate landlord and rich peasant ideology. At the same time, all disabled veterans should abide by the laws of the government and peasant associations and must not interfere with the work of the government and peasant associations.

    "content": "Neiqiu Prepares to Implement the Land Law\n　　Confiscates and Seals the Fruits of Struggle from Each Village\n　　Forbids Selling and Transferring Property\n　　[Neiqiu News] After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law of China, landlords and rich peasants took the opportunity to try every means to sabotage it. Some people who had gained more fruits in the past also calculated their family property based on the average property per capita in the village. Finding that they had a surplus, they used the excuse of production difficulties and lack of production funds to sell livestock, trees, clothes, grain, furniture and other property to resist the Outline Land Law. After discovering this phenomenon, the Neiqiu County Government specifically issued three preventive measures, ordering all villages to strictly implement them:\n　　1. All existing undistributed fruits of struggle in each village, whether property or cash, must be registered and sealed. Before the Outline Land Law is implemented, no individual is allowed to use them. If any incidents of sabotage or theft are discovered during or after the registration and sealing, they will be severely punished.\n　　2. Before the Outline Land Law is implemented, no one is allowed to sell or transfer property (including houses, land, trees, timber, livestock, clothing, grain, bedding, furniture, etc.) and the previously distributed fruits of struggle. When poor peasants and laborers who have not yet turned themselves over lack firewood, grain, and grass, they should be adjusted and resolved through mutual borrowing within the village. Those who lack production capital and production tools will be resolved through loans from economic departments (cooperatives and banks). The property of cadres and activists who have already turned themselves over is not allowed to be sold, just like other members of the masses. The landlords and rich peasants shall be prevented from selling and transferring property according to the Commissioner's Office's Proclamation, and it shall be earnestly implemented.\n　　3. Any bad elements found attempting to undermine the equal distribution of land shall be strictly dealt with in accordance with Articles 13 and 14 of the Outline Land Law and the regulations on punishing corruption in the border area. These laws and regulations should also be widely publicized in the winter schools in each village, and the masses should launch extensive research and discussion, telling anyone not to violate the laws, otherwise they will be punished by the people's court in the future. (Zhi'an, Zhenshan)\n　　[Xingtai News] After the Outline Land Law was transmitted to Xingtai, landlords and rich peasants everywhere sabotaged and resisted it. A rich peasant from Dushu in the Tenth District ran to Songjiazhuang Town and sold the house there. The landlord of × village in the Eleventh District sold all the trees. The rich peasants and landlords in other villages are feasting and drinking heavily. Zhou Shien, a fugitive soldier from Nanliangshe in the Fourth District, whose family was being struggled against, and Lu Huanlin, a teacher who had been dismissed, organized gambling, luring village chiefs, peasant association chairmen and other cadres into the game, ignoring the production of the poor peasants and laborers, and gambling heavily in the cooperative. Lu Huanlin lost more than 80,000 yuan, and the chairman of the peasant association also lost more than 50,000 yuan. These things should be stopped immediately.

Every trainee deeply hated Chiang Kai-shek. Wu Wu-yue, whose home is in Hsinchu County, Taiwan, said, \"We have been Japanese slaves for over fifty years, and we will never be American slaves again.

    "content": "Short Commentary\n\n　　Propagandize the Land Law Among Hired and Poor Peasants\n    Since the promulgation of the Land Law, we have received various reflections, and many have been published in the newspapers. How many of these reflections are from hired and poor peasants? Even if they are reflections from hired and poor peasants, what percentage of them are truthful? This is still worth questioning and studying.\n    We have found that most of what hired and poor peasants hear now is hearsay and rumors, even passed on from the mouths of landlords, rich peasants, or a few bad cadres. Some of these are exaggerations, while others are deliberate distortions. For example, in Hexi Village in Wu'an, there is a saying circulating: \"The Land Law is to unite rich peasants, unite middle peasants, not touch rich peasants, and not touch middle peasants\"; \"What was seized from landlords should be returned to them.\" This is the public opinion of landlords and rich peasants, used to scare hired and poor peasants, isolate hired and poor peasants, attack hired and poor peasants, and distort the Land Law.\n    In this situation, if no one comes out to correctly explain the Land Law to hired and poor peasants, giving the landlords' and rich peasants' public opinion a head-on blow, it will only make hired and poor peasants more suspicious and more afraid to act. In Hexi, an old farmhand of thirty years dared to speak only after the staff of the local office closed the doors and windows. When asked for his opinion on the Land Law, he said, \"I dare not say.\" It is evident that making hired and poor peasants truly accept the Land Law, treating it as their own weapon of struggle, understanding that they must take their fate into their own hands, and expressing their true opinions from the bottom of their hearts, is an extremely patient and arduous task; all careless, impatient, and simplistic approaches are unworkable. In order to break the current formalism in propagandizing the Land Law (reading it once in winter school as a matter of routine, or simply convening meetings of cadres and a few active hired and poor peasants to convey it), and to overcome the spontaneity in propaganda, we hope that all organs, after reorganizing their ranks, will combine the study of the Land Law with all cadres going deep into the hired and poor peasant stratum, visiting them door-to-door, and conducting propaganda based on the specific situation of each hired and poor peasant, refuting the distortions of the Land Law by landlords and rich peasants, and enlightening the hired and poor peasants to consciously accept the Land Law; we must listen to their opinions with the greatest enthusiasm, and then reflect them back, as an important preparatory work for the implementation of the Land Law in all areas.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 到雇贫中宣传土地法\n\n1948-01-22\n第1版()\n专栏：短论\n\n　　到雇贫中宣传土地法\n    土地法下来后，我们已经接到了各种反映，报上也登了不少；在这些反映里面，有多少是雇贫的反映？即使是雇贫的反映，又有百分之几十的真实性？确还值得怀疑和研究。\n    我们发现雇贫目前听到的多半是风声和传闻，甚至是从地主富农或少数坏干部的嘴里传过去的。其中有的是以讹传讹，有的则是故意曲解。譬如在武安河西村流传的就有这样说法：“土地法是团结富农，团结中农，不动富农，不动中农”；“把斗地主的东西还要还给人家”。这是地主富农的舆论，用来吓唬雇贫，孤立雇贫，打击雇贫，曲解土地法的。\n    在这种情况下，如果没有人出来正确的向雇贫解释土地法，给地主、富农舆论一个迎头痛击，那就使雇贫更加怀疑，更加不敢动。河西有一位三十年的老长工听驻地机关工作人员讲土地法，他亲自把门窗关上，才敢说话。问他对土地法的意见，还说：“咱不敢说。”可见让雇贫农真正接受土地法，把它当做自己的斗争武器，懂得把命运操在自己的手里，从内心里表示自己的真实的意见，是一件极其耐心的艰苦的工作；一切粗枝大叶、急性病、简单化的作风都是不行的。为了打破目前宣传土地法的形式主义（照例在冬学上念一遍，或单纯召开干部和少数雇贫积极分子会议传达），以及克服宣传上的自流性，我们希望各机关在整编队伍之后，结合上土地法的学习，全体干部深入雇贫层，挨门挨户的访问雇贫，根据每个雇贫的具体情况进行宣传，驳斥地主富农对土地法的曲解，启发雇贫自觉的接受土地法；一定要以最大的热情听取他们的意见，然后反映出来，作为全区各地执行土地法的一个重要的准备工作。"

    "author": "Gē Mǎ",
    "date": "1948-01-22",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Words I Didn't Understand for Ten Years\n　　(Fragments of My Understanding of Landlord Families)\n　　Gē Mǎ\n\n　　Ten years ago, I decided to go to Yan'an. Before I left, my father told me something. He said:\n　　\"If you really want to go, then go. Even if we go back twenty years, I'll go with you. I think your older brother will go too... However, don't believe the Communist Party's 'pamphlet' propaganda too much. When you get there, they might keep you outside the door, keep you out for a while. At that time, don't be distressed, pessimistic, or even commit suicide. Write to me, and I'll send money to get you back.\"\n　　At the time, hearing these words, I hardened my heart, lowered my head, and didn't even dare to look at his face. I always felt like something was weighing on my heart, like I was very sorry for him. This impression was very deep. After joining the revolution, when chatting with comrades about my family situation, I often liked to talk about this passage. Everyone who heard it said my father was very enlightened, and naturally I was very happy. So I would list his history: he had joined the Tongmenghui, served as a brigade commander during Li Yuanhong's presidency, and served as a Kuomintang member of parliament during Yuan Shikai's era, participating in parliamentary struggles, and so on. Therefore, I was sure that my father had political vision and was not reactionary. And I thought my father understood me, cared about me, and planned too thoroughly for me. And I was confident that I understood my father very well.\n　　Since the land reform study, deeply investigating my thoughts, I traced the root of my serious personal heroic achievement-seeking thought to my father. Therefore, my father appeared before me as a small warlord and a large landlord with two thousand mu of land. So, I felt that my father's words were worth considering. So, I thought of my brother's letter when I was studying at Lu Xun Academy of Art in Yan'an, which said: \"Father finds it strange that you went to Yan'an with great difficulty, but instead of studying politics, you started studying art?...\" So, I also feel strange now, does my father, such a warlord and big landlord, still want me to study politics to serve the people? No, I discovered his political intentions. He was hoping that I would be a \"official\" in the Communist Party in their eyes. According to his \"Xinhai Revolution\" style of thinking, this \"official\" could make foreign wealth. At least when the revolution gains power and the Communist Party gains power, he can still \"borrow light\" for some \"insurance\". So, I suddenly realized his words today. He knew that I had to leave, so he might as well be \"generous\" and \"enlightened\". The meaning of his previous words was to have me \"register\" them in my mind. Don't forget them, leave them an opportunity to \"invest\"; of course, they will not come. The latter part of his words was his last \"anti-communist\" propaganda to me, to carry out a \"political disintegration\", secretly tying a rope to me, hoping that if I \"run into a wall\", I would still go back to be his good landlord son.\n　　So, does my brother also have political intentions for me? Yes, when I left him, he was still a propaganda officer in the Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang Central Committee in Nanjing. In the two days before I left, he said to his friends in front of me: \"I sent my younger brother to the Communist Party to 'preserve' him...\" Of course, I was not sent by him. But what did he want to \"preserve\" me for? Did he really want to \"preserve\" me to be a long-term worker for the people? Obviously not. He and my father similarly hid a secret and unspeakable words. So, did I also register them in my mind? Yes, and very firmly. Last year, when I met comrades from the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army and chatted, I thought of getting my father a job in the government. I thought his old brand of the Xinhai Revolution could still be used. When Comrade ×× came back from the front and told me in a chat that he might be sent to Nanjing to participate in the CCP delegation, I also thought that my brother must have returned to Nanjing, and I could use his relationship to do some work for our Party. But God knows, if a person like me without a class stand really went, I don't know who would use whom. I joined the revolution in 1938 and also joined the Communist Party. I thought I was politically advanced, smart and capable, but my father and brother's simple words, after ten years and land reform studies, I finally understood. Where did my self-proclaimed cleverness and talent go? How foolish are people without a class stand?\n　　What attitude should be taken towards a family like mine? Here, I am also forced to recall a story that my father repeatedly told me:\n　　In the twentieth year of the Republic of China, when the Yangtze River flooded, my father, wanting to make a fortune, planted lotus seeds on two thousand mu of land and lived in the countryside. One afternoon, my father, seeing that the water was rising too high, called his tenant Liu Jinwang and said: \"I see that the water is too high today, so let's use my boat to send your ninety-year-old grandmother to the mountain. The elderly are important. After you send her away, quickly drive the boat back to pick me up.\" Liu Jinwang drove the boat away, sent his grandmother, and moved his own furniture, and never came back. In the evening, the moon came out, dimly. The Yangtze River dike collapsed, and the flood immediately rushed into my father's house. My father had to take his last concubine and stand on the square table, pressing some things on the table. The water slowly rose, reaching his chest. At this time, the concubine covered her face and cried, but my father seemed to say with great emotion: \"What are you crying about? Haven't we done enough evil in our lives? It's good to die and feed the fish in the flood, how clean.\" Here, my father seemed to want to die so \"heroically\" and \"generously\", but in the moment of crisis, an old fisherman who often brought fish to my father came in a boat. He saw the lights in my father's house and saved his life again.\n　　In the past, I was always moved and even cried when I heard this story. I thought my father was too bitter, and the peasant Liu Jinwang was \"selfish\" and let him down. Even this time in the three investigations, I still couldn't understand my father's intention in telling this story. I always thought that no matter how bad my father was, he was always a person. Could it be that a person is not as important as those furniture? Why didn't Liu Jinwang save my father and move his furniture? But today, thinking about it again: Why did my father ask Liu Jinwang to send his old grandmother? Is it really for so-called \"respect for the elderly\" and \"humanitarianism\"? No, he asked Liu Jinwang to send his grandmother for his own sake. When the flood came, he, the big landlord, was unable to escape. He wanted to give some small favors to buy off Liu Jinwang in order to escape. But the peasant Liu Jinwang had already seen through this. Who is selfish? My father, with his concubine, exploiting them, living an extremely corrupt life, had long let down the peasants and had long been hated by the peasants. Then, taking this opportunity, shouldn't Liu Jinwang \"let him down\"? In the eyes of the peasant Liu Jinwang, my father was far less important than their furniture. Their furniture, after being cleaned up, could still be used for labor and production, but what use was my father other than exploiting people? Why shouldn't the peasants move his production furniture and save my father, the bloodsucker, when the flood was rolling and in a very urgent situation? Understanding this also makes me understand my father's intention in telling the story. He was educating me to hate the peasants and to be a filial son to his \"humanitarian\" and \"righteous\" landlord father. Today, from this story, I also understand my father's sins. He exploited and treated the peasants too harshly, otherwise, the loyal peasant Liu Jinwang would not have failed to save his life. Then, understanding this, I also clearly affirmed my attitude towards my family. The peasant Liu Jinwang, who was distorted by my father, was right. The peasant Liu Jinwang educated me, and I must firmly stand on this side.\n　　This story is even earlier, it happened nineteen years ago, and I was so stupid that I didn't understand it until ten years after the revolution. I am willing to write it down, with the extremely indignant mood of a deceived person, and offer it to comrades who were born in alien classes and have not yet understood their words.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　January 19, 1948\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 十年没听懂的话　（我对地主家庭认识的片断）\n戈马\n1948-01-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　十年没听懂的话\n    （我对地主家庭认识的片断）\n    戈马\n    十年以前，我决定要到延安去了。临行时，我父亲给我讲了一段话。他说：\n    “你实在要去了就去吧，再转回去二十年我也陪你一块去。我看将来你哥哥也要去的………不过，你也不要太相信共产党的‘小册子’宣传了。你到了那里，他们可能把你关在门外头，关一个时期。那时候你不要苦恼，悲观失望，甚至于自杀，你写信给我，我再寄钱把你弄回来。”\n    当时听了这一段话，我是硬着心肠，低着头，连他的脸色都不敢看一下，总觉得心里压着一个什么东西，很对不起他似的。这印象留的很深，参加革命以后，和同志们闲谈起家里的情形来，我也常爱谈这一段话。大家听了都说我父亲很开明，我自然也很高兴，于是乎还要例举出他的历史来，他曾参加过同盟会，当过黎元洪总统时代的旅长，当过袁世凯时代国民党的议员，参加议会斗争等等。于是，我肯定我父亲是有政治眼光的，不反动的。并且以为我父亲就是理解我，关心我，为我打算得太周到了。而我也自信我非常理解我的父亲。\n    土地改革学习以来，深入查思想，查了我严重的个人英雄成名思想的根源，便查到了我父亲那里。于是，我父亲便以小军阀和拥有二千亩土地的大地主面貌，出现在我的面前了。于是，我觉得我父亲的那段话，颇值得考虑了。于是，我想到了我在延安鲁艺学习时，我哥哥来信说：“父亲很奇怪你，为什么千辛万苦跑到延安，不学政治学起艺术来了呢？………”于是，我现在也感到奇怪了，难道我那样一个军阀兼大地主的父亲，还要我为人民服务而学政治吗？不是的，我发现他的政治企图了，他是在希望着我在共产党里，做一个他们眼中的“官”。这个“官”，按照他那“辛亥革命”式的想法来看，是有洋财可发的。至少当革命得势，共产党得势的时候，他还可以“借光”一下来一个“保险”。于是，他那一段话，我今天才恍然领悟了，他是明知道我非走不可了，不妨“大方”“开明”一些的。他那前一段话的意思就是要我思想上给他们“挂个号”。不要忘掉他们，给他们留个可“投”的机；他们当然是不会来的。后一段话则是他对我最后一次的“反共”宣传，要来一个“政治瓦解”，给我暗暗的拴条绳子，盼望着我万一“碰壁”的话，依旧回去做他的好地主儿子。\n    那么，我哥哥是否对我也有政治企图呢？也有的，我离开他时，他还是南京国民党中央宣传部的宣传干事，临我要走的那两天，他曾当着我的面向他的朋友说：“我把我弟弟送到共产党那里‘保存’起来。……”我当然不是他送来的。但是，他想把我“保存”起来干什么呢？难道他真要把我“保存”起来为人民当长工吗？显然不是的，他和我父亲同样暗藏了一种密而不可告人的话。那么，我是否思想上也为他们挂了号呢？挂了的，而且挂得很牢。去年当我碰到新四军五师的同志闲谈起来的时候，我曾想到把我的父亲弄到政府里工作，我认为他那块辛亥革命的老牌子，还可以用一用。当××同志从前方回来，闲谈中告我他可能派到南京参加中共代表团时，我又曾想到我哥哥一定回南京了，我还可以利用他的关系，为我党做些工作。但是，天晓得，象我这样一个没有阶级立场的人，真要是去了，还不知道是谁利用谁呢？我三八年参加革命，也参加共产党了，自己以为政治上是进步的，聪明能干的，而我父亲和哥哥那样简单几句话，经过十年之久，土地改革学习以后，我才算是听懂了，我那种自命不凡的聪明才智哪里去了呢？没有阶级立场的人是何等的愚劣啊。\n    对我这样的家庭应采取什么态度呢？这里也迫使我想起我父亲曾再三告我的一个故事：\n    民国二十年，长江大水暴涨时，我父亲因想发洋财，把二千亩田都种上了莲子，住在乡下。一天下午，我父亲看着水势涨得太大了，叫来他的佃户刘金旺说：“我看今天水势太大，还是用我的船把你那九十岁的老奶奶送上山吧，老年人要当紧些。你送走了赶快把船驾回来接我。”刘金旺把船驾走了，送了他的祖母，又搬他自己的家具去了，一直没回来。傍晚，月亮出来了，昏昏的。长江的大堤倒了，大水立刻冲到了我父亲住的房子里，我父亲只好带着他最后的一个姨太太站到方桌上，在桌子上压了些东西。水慢慢涨起来，一直涌到他的胸口了，这时候，那位姨太太掩面哭泣了，我父亲却似乎很感慨的说：“你哭什么呢？我们这一辈子作的孽还少了吗，死了，大水里喂鱼多好，多干净。”这里，我父亲似乎是要死得多么“豪气”“慷慨”的了，但正在危急之时，一个经常给我父亲送鱼来的老渔户驾着船来了，他看见了我父亲家里的灯光，又救了他一命。\n    往年听了这段故事，总为我父亲感动，甚至流泪，以为我父亲太苦，农民刘金旺“自私自利”对不起他，甚至此次在三查中，我也还不能了解我父亲讲这故事的用意，总以为我父亲再不好，总是个人，难道人还不如那些家具重要吗？为什么刘金旺不救我父亲而搬他的家具去了呢？但今天转过来一想：我父亲为什么要刘金旺送他的老祖母呢？真是为了所谓“敬老”“人道主义”吗？不是的，他叫刘金旺去送他奶奶，正是为了他自己，大水来了，他这个大地主是无能逃脱的，他想施点小惠收买刘金旺以求得逃命。但农民刘金旺早看穿了这一套了，究竟是谁自私自利呢？我父亲带着姨太太，剥削着他们，过着极为腐化的生活，早很对不起农民，早已为农民恨之入骨了。那末趁着这个机会，刘金旺不应该“对不起”他一下吗？在农民刘金旺的眼里，我父亲远不如他们的家具重要，他的家具收拾起来，还可以再劳动生产，而我父亲除了剥削人以外，还有什么用处呢？为什么当着大水滚滚万分紧急的时候，农民不该搬他的生产家具，而要救我父亲那个吸血虫呢？明白了这个，也明白了我父亲讲故事的企图了。他是在教育我仇恨农民，叫我为他那个“人道”而“正义”的地主父亲做个孝顺儿子。今天从这个故事里，我也明白了我父亲的罪恶，他剥削苛打农民是太厉害了，不然，那个忠实的农民刘金旺不会不救他一命的。那末，明白了这，我也明确的肯定了我对我家庭的态度。被我父亲歪曲了的农民刘金旺是对的，农民刘金旺把我教育过来了，我要坚决站在这一边。\n    这故事更早，是十九年前的事了，而我愚笨得迟至革命后十年才理解。我愿写下来，以被愚弄者极为愤慨的心情，供献给出身于异己阶级，而尚未听懂他们的话的同志。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九四八、一、十九"

In previous years, we made revolution, but it wasn't thorough enough. Some landlords and rich men had family members who became cadres, and they shielded their families, so these people weren't struggled against thoroughly.

    "content": "Zuoquan's Hired and Poor Discuss Land Redistribution\n　　Peasants Still Have Misunderstandings, Widespread Education Urgently Needed\n　　[Our Newspaper's News] After hearing about the Land Law Outline, the vast number of poor and hired peasants in the first, second, third, fifth, and seventh districts of Zuoquan County were very excited. In particular, they expressed enthusiastic support for the article stipulating that the peasant association and the poor peasant leagues should be in charge of affairs. Many people said, \"Those cadres only talk nicely, but we don't know if they can really do it. Now we can be masters of our own affairs, so we are safe.\" A poor hired peasant from Cheshangpu in the seventh district said, \"Chairman Mao's words are really good. We should be given land first in the redistribution and landlords must be thoroughly overthrown before they can be given a share.\" Guo Xiangliang, a hired peasant from Xiafenghou Village in the first district, said, \"I have always wanted to cultivate a good piece of land, but I have never cultivated even an inch in my lifetime. Now that it is to be evenly distributed, and the fertile land is to be used to compensate the barren land, it should be my turn to cultivate a good piece of land.\" Zhao Xiaosan said, \"I was so happy when I heard about the Outline. When we turned over last year, we didn't get a good piece of land. The good land was still cultivated by the rich peasants. After the redistribution, I can get a good piece of land.\" Wang Yulun said, \"My land is only enough for one person to cultivate. I have always wanted to marry a wife, but I don't dare to marry without anything. This time, with the redistribution, each person will get a larger share, so there is a way.\" The poor hired peasants in Liangjia Village initially couldn't understand why landlords should be given a share. Many people said, \"The landlord in our village still cultivates the good land and lives in a building, while we are still poor. What do we have to give him?\" Later, after it was made clear that the landlords would be thoroughly overthrown first and then given a share, they agreed. A young female village head of a poor hired peasant from Gaojiajing in the fifth district said, \"In the past, our poor people would dig the landlord's barren slopes, and he wouldn't allow it. Now we're giving him a share, which is really cheap for him. But everyone should understand that the equal distribution of land is a matter for us poor and hired peasants, and has nothing to do with the landlords.\"\n　　However, there are many misunderstandings and distortions of the Land Law that have been discovered in various districts, which are worth noting: First, wealthy middle peasants are only affected by their land, not their movable property. Many villages have not clearly publicized this point, causing anxiety among the middle peasants. Winter production in Lichang Village in the first district has come to a standstill. Cadres and middle peasants are eating and drinking lavishly, wasting a lot. Six sheep were killed in two days in Duanyu Village. Women in Zhangba Village in the third district have stopped spinning, and men are no longer engaged in transportation. Second, the equal distribution of land is misunderstood as \"communism.\" As a result, some old middle peasants have developed a fear of \"partnership.\" The middle peasants in Kutidi and six other villages in the first district said, \"Equal distribution is communism. It's better to live a collective life together. Anyway, nothing belongs to anyone, and everything must be divided equally.\" Third, no attention has been paid to the landlords taking advantage of loopholes to spread rumors. For example, Li Jiliang, a landlord in Fuyu Village in the first district, said, \"Is this time's equal distribution of land because the past struggles were wrong?\" After hearing the Land Law Outline, the landlord of Qinghe Shop actually sang a local opera on the street and said, \"This is nothing to be afraid of, it's getting better!\" Fourth, some cadres who have taken too many fruits have begun to disperse and sell their property secretly. For example, the director of the Wang Peasant Association closed the flour mill and slaughtered six pigs, and the political director sold forty catties of hemp.

During the reorganization meeting, pay attention to the general ideological situation of cadres at the beginning of the meeting; the ideological types of cadres of various components discovered through introspection, and their erroneous facts; the ideological leadership of the meeting, especially the experience and existing shortcomings in organizing and carrying out correct ideological struggle within the party; typical ideological materials; and the general ideological gains after studying. According to the decision of the Central Bureau Propaganda Department, after the complete and thorough land redistribution in the entire district is largely completed, prepare to convene a party education work research conference to specifically summarize the ideological situation of party member cadres during the land redistribution period, and the initial experience of building the party ideologically, especially to summarize the branch education work (including during and after the reorganization), so as to be able to formulate a party education plan for the second half of the year at the conference. In the land redistribution movement, the propaganda departments of the party at all levels must quickly establish a system of cultural committee members concurrently serving as party newspaper correspondents within the poor peasant associations, cultivate thousands of genuine worker-peasant correspondents, establish a new communication network to replace the old communication organization, and serve as the grassroots foundation for the true localization of the party newspaper. And prepare to convene a party worker-peasant correspondent conference at the same time as the party education conference, to initially summarize the experience of developing and establishing a worker-peasant communication network, and organizing them to write articles and read newspapers. At the same time, attention should be paid to collecting the reflections of various classes and aspects in the village after the promulgation of the Outline Land Law.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 整编队伍中　建立系统宣传工作　太行区党委宣传部发出指示\n\n1948-01-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　整编队伍中\n  　建立系统宣传工作\n  　太行区党委宣传部发出指示\n    【本报消息】太行区党委宣传部顷指示各地委宣传部，切实贯彻中央局宣联会精神，在整编队伍中，把自己的工作系统的建立起来，确定汇报制度。在整编会议时，注意会议开初干部一般思想情况；经过反省所发现的各种成份干部的思想类型，与他们的错误事实；会议的思想领导，特别是组织开展党内正确思想斗争的经验和存在的缺点；典型思想材料；经过学习后一般思想上的收获。根据中央局宣传部决定，全区彻底平分土地大体完成后，即准备召开一次党内教育工作研究会，专门总结在平分土地期间党员干部的思想情况，和从思想上建党的初步经验，特别是要总结支部教育工作（包括整编期间与整编后），以便能在会上订出下半年党内教育计划。在平分土地运动中，各级党的宣传部，必须迅速在贫农团内建立文化委员兼党报通讯员的制度，培养成千的真正工农通讯员，建立新的通讯网，代替旧的通讯组织，作为党报真正地方化的下层基础。并准备与召开党内教育会议的同时，召开一次党内工农通讯员会议，初步总结发展建立工农通讯网，组织他们写稿、读报的经验。同时应注意收集土地法大纲公布后，村里各阶层各方面的反映。"

This campaign began on the night of December 27th. The Liberation Army first completely destroyed approximately 400 li of railway lines on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway from Zhuoxian to Baoding, the Ping-Jin section of the Bei-Ning Railway from Huangcun to Weishanzhuang, the Jin-Pu Railway from Jinghai to Tangguantun, and the Ping-Sui Railway from Shacheng to Qinglongqiao, Nankou to Qinghe, and Julebao to Tianzhen, severing transportation and isolating the bandit-puppet heartlands of Peiping, Tianjin, Baoding, and Zhangjiakou. The destruction of the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, which the bandit-puppets had repaired and reopened for only a few days, was the most thorough, with roadbeds, bridges, rails, and sleepers completely flattened. The Liberation Army re-liberated Caohe Station, Baitapu, Xuheqiao, and Taibaoying on the Ping-Han Railway, Tangguantun, Wulizhuang, Liuhe, and Zhakou on the Jin-Pu Railway, and the important outer strongholds of the bandits on the Ping-Sui Railway, including Gucheng, Yangfang, Xinzhuang, and Baiyangcheng. On the 28th, we annihilated more than 360 of Fu Zuoyi's bandits at Laojuntang, 20 li east of Yanqing City on the Ping-Sui Railway. On the 29th, we killed and wounded more than 500 of Fu Zuoyi's 35th Army, New 32nd Division, at Yangfang, and briefly captured Xiongxian City, 90 li northeast of Baoding. From the 1st to the 11th of this month, the Liberation Army continued its offensive operations. On the 10th, the Liberation Army captured Efang, 20 li south of Fengtai, a key dispatching point on the Bei-Ning Railway, and Jiuzhouzhen, an important stronghold of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits about 70 li directly south of Peiping, completely annihilating the 270-plus enemy troops defending it, and routing two regiments of the remnants of the bandit's 92nd Army, 21st Division, which had come to reinforce from Langfang. On the 11th, another unit of the Liberation Army completely annihilated one regiment of the Provisional 3rd Army, Provisional 12th Division, along the Dashiling to Zhunwan line north of the Ping-Sui Railway. On the same day, the Liberation Army on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway launched a fierce attack on Laishui City, immediately occupying the four gates, and annihilating the headquarters of Fu Zuoyi's 35th Army, New 32nd Division, its affiliated mountain artillery company, and the majority of its two subordinate regiments, the 94th and 96th, and part of a howitzer battalion directly under the 35th Army, and part of the 101st Division, at Zhuangcun, more than 10 li east of Laishui City, attempting to rescue Laishui from Dingxing and Gucheng. The commander of the bandit's New 32nd Division, Li Mingding, was killed by our forces in the battle. Detailed battle results are currently being tallied.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Dong, 20th: On the 4th, a certain unit of the Liberation Army launched a major sabotage campaign against the Bei-Ning and Jin-Cheng Railways, annihilating more than 460 enemy troops. Our army, entering the Goubangzi to Jinzhou section, completely annihilated a company of the 184th Division and two traffic police platoons guarding Shishan Station, capturing more than 200 alive and killing more than 80. Another unit of our army, entering the Jin (zhou) - Yi (xian) section, captured Yimatuan Station, annihilating part of the puppet local army's 174th Division, capturing Deputy Battalion Commander Su Jianhui and over 160 others alive, and killing or wounding more than 10, including company commanders. The Chiang bandits stationed at Qinghemen Station in the Fuxin-Yixian section fled south in a panic on the 6th. In the above battles, a total of three 60mm mortars, seven light machine guns, and more than 270 long and short rifles were captured. Shishan, Yangquanzi, and other stations on the Bei-Ning Railway were burned down, three bridges and two water towers were destroyed, and more than 300 rails were dismantled.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 斩断华北蒋匪四大动脉　晋察冀军民大破击　平津保张家口间交通完全断绝歼匪新三十二师大部打死师长\n\n1948-01-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　斩断华北蒋匪四大动脉\n  　晋察冀军民大破击\n  　平津保张家口间交通完全断绝歼匪新三十二师大部打死师长\n    【新华社晋察冀前线二十日电】迟到消息：新年前后，晋察冀解放军冒奇寒大雪向华北蒋匪四大动脉——平汉、北宁、津浦、平绥铁路，同时展开大破击战，歼灭傅匪三十五军新三十二师大部，一○一师一部及暂三军十二师一个团等。此一战役开始于十二月二十七日夜。解放军首将平汉路北段涿县至保定、北宁路平津段黄村至魏善庄、津浦路静海至唐官屯、平绥路沙城至青龙桥、南口至清河、聚乐堡至天镇各段，长约四百华里之铁路线全部破坏，使华北匪伪心脏北平、天津、保定、张家口之间，交通断绝，各自孤立。其中经匪伪抢修通车未及数日的平汉北段破坏最为彻底，路基、桥梁、铁轨、枕木尽被平毁。解放军再度解放平汉路漕河车站、白塔铺、徐河桥、太保营，津浦路唐官屯、五里庄、流河、闸口、平绥路上南口匪外围重要据点古城、阳坊、辛庄、白羊城。二十八日我于平绥路延庆城东二十里之老君堂歼傅匪三百六十余人。二十九日又于阳坊击毙伤傅匪三十五军新三十二师五百余人，并一度攻克保定东北九十华里之雄县城。本月一日至十一日，解放军继续攻势作战，十日解放军攻克北宁路调度基点丰台南二十里之鹅坊及北平正南约七十里之蒋匪重要据点旧州镇，全歼守敌二百七十余人，并击溃由廊房增援之匪九十二军二十一师残部两个团。十一日另部解放军于平绥线北之大石岭至准湾一线，全歼傅匪暂三军暂十二师一个团。同日平汉北段解放军向涞水城猛攻，当即占领四关，并于涞水城东十余华里之庄町村歼灭由定兴、固城企图援救涞水之傅匪三十五军新三十二师师部、师属山炮连及其所辖九十四、九十六两个团大部，及三十五军军直属榴炮营一部，一○一师一部，匪新三十二师师长李铭鼎于战斗中被我击毙，详细战果正清查中。\n    【新华社冀东二十日电】解放军某部四日向北宁路和锦承路，展开大破袭，歼敌四百六十多名。进入沟帮子到锦州段的我军，将石山车站守敌一八四师的一个连和交警两个中队全部歼灭，活捉二百多名，打死八十多名。进入锦（州）、义（县）段的另部我军，打下伊马团车站，歼灭伪地方军一七四师一部，活捉副营长苏建辉以下一百六十多名，毙伤连长以下十多名。驻阜（新）、义（县）段清河门车站的蒋匪，六日慌忙南逃。以上各次战斗，共缴获六○炮三门、轻机枪七挺、长短枪二百七十多支。烧毁北宁路石山、羊圈子等车站，炸毁桥梁三座、水塔二座、拆毁铁轨三百多条。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 18th. The Jin-Sui Military Region Headquarters Political Department and the Border Region Administrative Office jointly issued a decision and instructions on demobilization work on December 6th, pointing out that: due to the past demobilization regulations not being clear enough, and the relevant authorities not handling it carefully enough, some who should not have been demobilized were, and even class alien elements, speculators, local bullies, riffraff, and hooligans etc. have fraudulently obtained demobilization certificates and preferential treatment, flaunting and undermining government decrees, oppressing the masses, committing all kinds of evil, affecting military-civilian unity, hindering land reform, and causing dissatisfaction among the masses and genuine demobilized soldiers. In order to overcome this chaotic situation, it is decided that:\n\n　　First, all those who have been demobilized should be subjected to strict review in the land reform movement. (1) Demobilized soldiers who meet the demobilization conditions, abide by government laws and decrees, are of good character, actively participate in land reform, work hard in production, or continue to serve the masses, should be appropriately commended and rewarded, and their return-home certificates should be taken back and cancelled. (2) Class alien elements, speculators, enemy and puppet elements, local bullies, etc., should have their certificates confiscated, the preferential materials obtained by fraud recovered, and be unconditionally handled by the masses. (3) Other types of people who should be purged and expelled but have fraudulently obtained demobilized soldier treatment should have their certificates confiscated, the preferential materials obtained by fraud or public funds and materials illegally stolen should be recovered, and be handed over to the masses for supervision, education, and transformation. If the family is poor and the performance after returning home is still good, they can be treated leniently at discretion. (4) Streamlined personnel who do not meet the demobilization conditions should have their demobilized soldier treatment stopped, and their certificates recovered. The preferential materials they have obtained should be retained at discretion according to their history and performance after demobilization. Those without crimes can be treated the same as basic masses. Those who have committed crimes of oppressing and harming the masses must still be handed over to the masses for handling. (5) Those who return home due to lack of labor in the family, although they can be regarded as demobilized soldiers, the preferential treatment they enjoy should be stopped immediately, and they should still return to the team when they meet the conditions for returning to the team. Those who should not have been demobilized but obtained demobilization procedures by taking advantage of work negligence should have their demobilized soldier status cancelled. They must still return to the team when they meet the conditions for returning to the team. (6) Honored soldiers who have been demobilized and are truly disabled due to combat or official duties should be compensated according to the decision method; however, when their disability situation changes or disappears, the county government should designate a doctor to examine them, or the masses should evaluate and change or cancel their rank; those whose rank is cancelled should stop the compensation and recover the honorary certificate, and be treated as general demobilized soldiers. Those who meet the conditions for returning to the team can return to the team. Those who are disabled not due to combat against the enemy or official duties, or disabled prisoners of war captured by us, should have their honorary certificates recovered and the compensation they have enjoyed recovered. If the family is indeed poor, the recovery of some parts can be reduced or exempted at discretion, and the demobilized soldier status can be cancelled or retained. Those who have not been injured or disabled but have fraudulently obtained or bought honorary certificates by taking advantage of work negligence or private relationships, or those who have fraudulently claimed more than one certificate, in addition to confiscating the honorary certificate and recovering the fraudulently obtained compensation materials, must be punished according to law, and the original certificate issuing agency or the certificate seller must be investigated. (7) Those who meet the conditions for elderly preferential treatment should be treated preferentially according to the decision method, and those who do not meet the conditions should have their certificates and preferential treatment revoked (according to past regulations, elderly soldiers who have been in the military for more than five years and less than ten years and have elderly preferential treatment certificates should also have their certificates recovered and preferential treatment stopped. The preferential treatment already enjoyed can be exempted from recovery), those whose certificates are obtained through improper channels, in addition to recovering the certificates and preferential treatment, should be punished according to law, and their related persons should be investigated. Those who obtained honorary certificates due to old age should have their honorary certificates recovered, and if they are indeed in compliance with the conditions for elderly preferential treatment, they can apply to the special commissioner's office for approval to exchange for an elderly certificate. (8) Those who are indeed suffering from serious chronic diseases due to official duties should be treated preferentially according to the decision method, and if they obtained honorary certificates due to illness, the honorary certificates should be recovered. After the county government is responsible for reviewing their history and family situation, if they meet the preferential treatment conditions, they should apply to the administrative office for approval of preferential treatment. (9) Those who meet the conditions for demobilized soldiers, but do not engage in production, engage in speculation and opportunism, are of bad character, oppress the masses, undermine government laws and decrees, obstruct land reform, harm the interests of the masses, and do not repent after repeated education, should have their demobilized soldier status revoked and handed over to the masses for handling. (10) Those who settle in more than two places and fraudulently obtain more than two copies of preferential treatment should have their preferential materials recovered and be punished according to law. Those who transfer their place of residence on their own must obtain proof from the masses and government of the original resettlement location, and be handled at discretion by the masses and government of the current residence. (11) All recovered demobilization certificates, honorary certificates, and elderly certificates should be reported by the county government to the administrative office for cancellation.\n\n　　Second, in order to prevent the continued occurrence of malpractices, so that demobilized persons have a means of livelihood, those in service are actively upward, and truly achieve the purpose of consolidating the troops, in the future when dealing with demobilized personnel, the relevant authorities must carry out this work with the spirit of being responsible to the masses and with a high degree of political responsibility. Resolutely overcome all irresponsible erroneous attitudes such as shirking responsibility and perfunctoriness.\n\n　　Third, the resettlement of demobilized soldiers should pay attention to the following points: (1) Those whose homes are in the liberated area and can return should be introduced to return to their place of origin for production, and should not be introduced to settle in other counties. Demobilized soldiers who have settled down should also be helped to return to their place of origin as much as possible according to their specific circumstances.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 20th: The People's Liberation Army units advancing to fight around Shenyang are distributing grain and land to the masses while fighting. Wherever the People's Liberation Army arrives, the masses immediately launch a fierce struggle to eliminate feudalism. A unit of the People's Liberation Army operating in the southern area of Shenyang helped the masses distribute 150,000 catties of grain and more than 400 pieces of clothing from landlords in one week. Another unit helped the masses confiscate 27 landlord households and distribute 1,800 shi of grain to more than 3,600 poor peasants in six days. A certain unit helped the masses distribute 800,000 catties of grain, more than 20,000 pieces of clothing, and more than 800 quilts from 58 landlord households. In Li Daren Village, 47 long and short guns were also seized from landlords. Many villages and towns are spontaneously organizing struggles, distributing land and starting to establish their own organizations. For example, in a certain village with more than 100 households, 350 people participated in the Turn-Over Association, and in a certain village, more than 100 militiamen were organized in a very short period of time.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 20th: Late news: On the 30th of last month, the People's Liberation Army entered the city of Heishan in western Shenyang. Despite the severe cold of minus 30 degrees, groups of hungry people were gathered on both sides of the street. Each person carried a pocket, requesting the People's Liberation Army to open granaries and provide relief to the poor. Wherever the People's Liberation Army personnel walked on the street, they were followed by hundreds of poor people asking for grain distribution. The People's Liberation Army immediately sent working groups to conduct investigations and distribute grain. The home of Chief Chen, a local tyrant, landlord, and puppet Manchukuo officer hiding in the city, was even more crowded with thousands of people. The two large iron gates were rushed open by the hungry people, and the grain in the eight large warehouses was quickly distributed. After the news of grain distribution spread, more and more hungry people came, and even teachers and students from the two middle schools in Heishan appeared among the masses carrying grain. Farmers from 30 miles outside the city also rushed to distribute grain. For two whole days, the streets and alleys of Heishan were filled with people distributing grain. According to incomplete statistics, in two days, out of more than 50,000 people in Heishan County, more than 35,000 people participated in the struggle, and 43,000 people received the fruits of victory. 39 local tyrants were divided, and more than 2,500 shi of grain, 8,200 pieces of bean cake, more than 50,000 pieces of clothing, more than 30,000 catties of cotton, 12,000 catties of oil, and more than 50,000 catties of coal were distributed.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Front, 20th: After the People's Liberation Army of the Jianghan Military Region captured Suixian County, it immediately assisted residents in seizing the houses of the Western Pass that had been set on fire by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, opened warehouses, and provided relief to poor peasants inside and outside the city. When residents saw the People's Liberation Army, they accused the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army of setting fire to the streets before being annihilated. On the evening of the 6th, as soon as the guns of the People's Liberation Army sounded, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the city sent company and platoon leaders to the Western Pass, ordering every household to light up their lamps, and then ordered the houses of the Western Pass to be burned. The Chiang Kai-shek military officers ignored the pleas of the people of the entire pass kneeling and kowtowing, dispersed the people, immediately ordered the bandits to set fire, and set up machine guns on the city wall, aiming at the people who were rushing to move their own things. Cries of grief were heard everywhere, a tragic scene beyond description. Chen Zhenji's 14-year-old child was shot and killed, burned beyond recognition, and Wan Yihong and six others were injured by machine gun fire. The People's Liberation Army entered the city gate and immediately helped residents put out the flames in the streets and carried out appeasement. On the 7th, more than 10,000 poor peasants inside and outside the city received grain, and they happily said: \"In the past, we could only carry grain into the city, but we have never carried grain out of the city.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 沈阳外围我军在战斗中分粮黑山两天三万多人参加斗争\n\n1948-01-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　沈阳外围我军在战斗中分粮黑山两天三万多人参加斗争\n    【新华社东北前线二十日电】挺进沈阳四周作战的解放军各部，一面战斗，一面发动群众分粮、分浮。解放军所到之处，群众即掀起猛烈的消灭封建的斗争。活动沈（阳）南一带的解放军某部，一周内帮助群众分了地主十五万斤粮食，四百余件衣服。另部六天中帮助群众没收地主二十七户，三千六百余贫苦农民分粮一千八百石。某部帮助群众分了五十八户地主，群众分得粮食八十余万斤、衣服二万余件、被子八百余条。在李大人屯并起出地主长短枪四十七支。许多村屯群众，自动组织斗争，分浮分地并开始建立自己的组织，如某屯居民百余户，即有三百五十人参加翻身会，某屯很短时间内组织了百余民兵。\n    【新华社东北二十日电】迟到消息：上月三十日解放军进驻沈西黑山县城，虽在零下三十度的严寒中，大街两旁仍聚立着一群群饥饿的人们。每人身上都背着一条口袋，纷纷请求解放军开仓济贫。解放军人员在街上走过，身后都跟着数百要求分粮的贫民。解放军立刻派出工作组进行调查和分粮。隐藏在城内的恶霸地主伪满军官陈团长家里，更拥挤了上千的群众，两扇大铁门被饥饿的人们一冲打开，八间大仓库的粮食很快就被分掉。分粮消息传出后，饥民越来越多，甚至连黑山两级中学的教员、学生也出现在扛粮的群众里。城外三十里的农民也赶来分粮。整整两天黑山城的大街小巷都挤满了分粮的群众。据不完全统计，两天中黑山全县的五万余人，有三万五千余人参加了斗争，四万三千余人得到了果实，被分土劣三十九户，分出粮食两千五百余石，豆饼八千二百块，衣物五万余件，棉花三万余斤，油一万二千斤，煤五万余斤。\n    【新华社鄂豫皖前线二十日电】江汉军区解放军攻克随县城后，立即协助居民抢劫了蒋匪纵火焚烧的西关民房，并开放仓库，救济城内外贫苦农民。居民看到解放军时，纷纷控诉蒋匪军在被歼灭前放火烧街的罪行。六号晚上，解放军的枪刚刚打响，城里的蒋匪就派了连排长到西关，命令家家户户都点起灯来，接着又下令烧西关的民房，蒋匪军官不顾全关老百姓跪地叩头请求，反把老百姓打散，立即叫匪兵放起火来，并在城墙上架起机枪，对准抢搬自己东西的老百姓射击，一时哭声四起，惨不忍闻，居民陈斟记十四岁的孩子被打死，烧得不辨人形，万翊洪等六人均被机枪打伤。解放军进入城关，马上帮助居民扑灭各街的火焰，进行安抚。七日，城内外一万多贫苦农民分得了粮食，他们都欢喜的说：以前我们只能把粮食背进城里，从来没有把粮食从城里背出城外。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 17th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the lives of the broad masses of people in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas are extremely difficult this winter. After the appearance of the 100,000 yuan banknote, the prices of cotton and cloth in Shanghai rose again. A cotton quilt costs over a million yuan. In the fierce northwest wind, the poor citizens, rickshaw pullers, and pedicab drivers who are out on the streets trying to make a living are still wearing tattered, thin or unlined clothing. At night, many people use sacks and large advertising papers from department stores as blankets, sleeping on the cold cement. In the dead of night, there are pitiful, trembling groans everywhere. In the severe cold of mid-November, fifty-four people froze to death in one night, including seven disabled soldiers abandoned by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. In hunger and cold, many students in Shenyang have not yet received their cotton clothes. Three thousand seven hundred \"Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army\" soldiers abandoned by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Shenyang are also suffering from hunger and cold, and deaths from freezing and starvation are reported daily. They are now organizing \"beggar gangs\" to make a living. In Changchun, threatened by a coal shortage, tree branches and bark have been stripped bare for cooking and heating. In the midst of a coal shortage in Beiping, the price of boiled water has also risen, and poor students gnaw on cold, hard cornbread, unable to afford even boiled water. A professor at Peking University wears a worn-out overcoat from twenty years ago and goes to class every day in the dusty wind, his fingers so frozen that he can't even hold the chalk. Prices in Tianjin are also soaring. Within five days, more than 2,300 citizens appealed to a certain newspaper for help due to their inability to make a living. Deaths from freezing and starvation are discovered every day, and among them are sometimes Chiang Kai-shek soldiers. Students from Laiyang who were deceived and forced to go to Qingdao by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have now become collective beggars. Public school employees in Jinan have not yet received all of their cotton clothes, and everyone shivers in the cold when going to work in the morning. Chiang Kai-shek's police in Wuxi are still on duty in their summer uniforms.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 18th: According to Shanghai newspapers, amidst widespread coal shortages in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, a monopoly organization of the four major families and political beggar organizations of the Youth Party, is implementing \"control\" over the production and sales of all fuel coal, thereby manipulating the market and seizing huge profits. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit \"Fuel Management Committee\" paid only 840,000 yuan at the official price per ton of coal produced by the Huainan Coal Mine, which it acquired last November, when delivered at Pukou. However, the price at which the committee sold it to various factories in Nanjing and put it on the black market reached 1.15 million to 2.5 million yuan or more per ton. In the process of reselling, they made several times the profit. The committee also hoarded as much as 200,000 tons of fuel coal in Shanghai, causing the price of coal in Shanghai to rise wildly, with the highest black market price exceeding 4 million yuan. The broad masses of people are suffering from this, and private coal mines are also severely impacted.\n\nXinhua News Agency, East China, January 20th: Shanghai Newspaper reports: Shanghai students launched a campaign to collect winter clothing to aid the poor. On the 18th of last month, Shanghai had heavy snow, and the temperature dropped below zero. On the 19th and 20th, 230 poor people froze to death on the streets, which the Chiang Kai-shek bandits ignored. Students from Tongji University took the lead in launching a campaign to collect winter clothing, and Fudan, Jiaotong, Jinan, and Daxia Universities also responded. Fudan also received unanimous support from sixteen student organizations within the school. On the first day, Tongji University collected more than 500 pieces of clothing, shoes, and socks on campus and distributed them to the poor on the streets despite the wind and snow. Rickshaw pullers volunteered to transport them for free, driving for five or six hours without asking for a penny. By the fourth day, the school's fundraising group had increased from fourteen to more than fifty, and the fundraising campaign had expanded from within the school to outside the school. On the 21st, more than 300 students spent the whole day in Hongkou, Yangshupu, Zhabei and other places, collecting 3,000 pieces of clothing, shoes, socks, quilts, scarves, etc. This movement is still developing.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 没有棉衣没有煤炭蒋区到处冻死贫民\n\n1948-01-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　没有棉衣没有煤炭蒋区到处冻死贫民\n    【新华社陕北十七日电】综合消息：蒋区广大人民，今冬生活极苦。十万大钞出现后，上海棉和布又涨了价，一条棉被要百万元以上。暴烈的西北风中，奔走街头谋生的贫苦市民，三轮车夫和黄包车夫，还穿着褴褛破烂的单衣或夹衣。晚上许多人则以麻袋和百货公司的大幅广告纸当作被子，露宿在冰冷的水门汀上。夜深人静时，到处发出凄厉颤抖的呻吟，十一月中旬暴寒，一夜就冻死了五十四个人，其中七个是被蒋匪抛弃的残废军人。在饥寒中的沈阳许多学生棉衣尚未上身。被蒋匪弃置在沈的三千七百个“东北抗日义勇军”亦饥寒交迫，冻饿而死者日有所闻，现正组织“讨饭团”谋生。煤荒威胁下的长春，树枝树皮都被人剥光，用以煮饭及取暖，北平煤荒声中，开水也涨了价，穷学生们啃着冰泠的硬窝窝头，连开水也喝不起。北大某教授穿着廿年前的破旧大衣每天在漫天风沙中跑去上课，手指冻得粉笔也拿不起来。天津物价亦暴涨中，五日之内因无法生活，向某报呼吁求助的市民达二千三百余人。冻饿而死者连日均有发现，且其中时有蒋军军人。被蒋匪骗迫至青岛之莱阳学生，今已陷为集体乞丐。济南公教人员的棉衣到现在还没有发齐，晨起上班，大家都瑟缩打战。无锡之蒋匪警察现在还穿着夏季制服站岗。\n    【新华社陕北十八日电】据沪报消息：蒋管区普遍煤荒声中，四大家族垄断机构及青年党政治乞丐参与分肥的经济部燃料管理委员会，实行全部燃煤产销之“管制”，从而操纵市场攫取暴利。蒋匪“燃管会”去年十一月收购之淮南煤矿产煤，于浦口交货每吨仅付官价八十四万元，而该会售与南京各工厂及投入黑市者每吨价格竟达一百十五万至二百五十万元以上。转手之间，获利数倍。该会并在上海囤积燃煤达二十万吨之巨，致上海煤价疯狂上涨，黑市最高价格已突破四百万元大关。广大人民均蒙其害，民营煤矿亦受深重打击。\n    【新华社华东二十日电】沪报讯：上海学生发动劝募寒衣救济贫民运动。上月十八日上海大雪，温度隆至零度以下。十九、二十两日就有贫民二百三十人冻死街头，蒋匪视若无睹。同济学生首先发起劝募寒衣，复旦、交通、暨南、大夏等大学亦纷起响应，复旦并获得校内十六个社团一致支持。同济第一日在校内募集衣服鞋袜五百余件，并冒风雪分送街头贫民。三轮车夫自愿义务运送，连驶五六小时不要分文。到第四天，该校劝募小组由十四个增至五十余个，劝募运动亦由校内扩至校外，二十一日，三百余学生整日在虹口、杨树浦、闸北等地，共募得衣服鞋袜棉被围巾等达三千件。此一运动仍在发展中。"

A rice-grabbing wave broke out on the 13th of this month. At 3:00 PM that day, more than twenty rickshaw pullers were buying flour at a noodle shop on Fuxing Road. While they were buying, the price of flour suddenly rose from 6,000 yuan to 8,000 yuan per jin. The rickshaw pullers and others were extremely resentful and immediately seized nine bags of flour and left. Poor people along the way responded en masse, swarming into a shop on Beiping Road and seizing rice, flour, and other items worth 2 million Chiang Kai-shek currency. They then moved to Jihe Street, where the crowd seizing rice had expanded to more than two hundred people, and the momentum grew larger and larger.

After the farmers heard the news of land distribution, their enthusiasm for participating in the war greatly increased, their awareness greatly improved, and they realized: to distribute land, it is necessary to defeat Chiang Kai-shek. They enthusiastically participated in this action. Li Jilin, a laborer from Anguo who had been working as a hired hand for three generations, participated in the Qingfengdian Campaign and won the glorious title of \"Anguo Model Laborer.\" This time, before departing, he said at a meeting of hired and poor peasants: \"This time I will add merit to merit. I am willing to join the Communist Party and always work for my poor brothers.\" All the hired and poor peasants unanimously said: \"He is qualified to be a party member.\" The county party committee immediately accepted him into the party. Li Gang, a poor peasant and deputy instructor of the Second Company of the Second Brigade of the Anguo stretcher team, resolutely abandoned his wedding on the 28th day of the eleventh lunar month to defend the land distribution and joined the stretcher team. He said: \"Wherever the troops fight, I will follow them. I will wait until my family has distributed the land and I have made meritorious service before returning home to get married.\" The laborers in Shenze unanimously issued the resounding slogan \"Return home with merit\" at the meeting, and not a single person dropped out during the four-day march. In Qingcang, Jiaohe, Jianguo and other places in central Hebei, hired and poor peasants took the lead in launching a wave of challenges to gain merit during the march, with 80 percent of the team members voluntarily setting merit plans. On the night of the 27th and the 28th, ten demolition regiments from central Hebei and more than 8,000 laborers from Mancheng rushed to the railway line and began dismantling it together. Farmers in Xushui voluntarily drove more than 1,000 carts to rush to transport sleepers and rails. At this moment, the rails and sleepers in the northern section of Pinghan and the eastern section of Pingsui have been mostly cleared, and the roadbed, frozen by ice and snow, has been thoroughly destroyed.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 认识到要分地不打老蒋不行　北岳冀中十万农民奋起　彻底破毁平汉北段平绥东段\n\n1948-01-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　认识到要分地不打老蒋不行\n  　北岳冀中十万农民奋起\n  　彻底破毁平汉北段平绥东段\n    【新华社晋察冀前线二十日电】北岳、冀中十万农民经五天紧张的破击战，使蒋匪恢复通车仅三天的平汉铁路平保段，及平绥路东段支离破碎。农民自听到平分土地消息后，参战情绪非常高涨，觉悟大大提高，认识到：要分地不打老蒋不行，热烈参加这一行动。三辈做长活的安国民工李吉林，参加清风店战役，曾获“安国模范民工”的光荣称号，这次出发时，他在雇贫农大会上说：“这回我要功上加功。我愿参加共产党，永远为穷哥们办事”。全体雇贫农一致说：“他够个党员”。县委立即接受他入党。安国担架队第二大队二连副指导员贫农李刚，为保卫平分土地，把阴历十一月二十八日结婚大事，坚决扔下，参加担架队。他说：“部队打到那里，我跟到那里，等着家里分了地，我也立了功，才回家结婚”。深泽民工在会上一致发出“要带功回家”的响亮口号，行军四天没有一个掉队的。冀中青沧、交河、建国等地民工，行军中雇贫农带头掀起挑战立功热潮，百分之八十的队员自动订了立功计划。二十七日夜及二十八日冀中十个破击团及满城民工八千多人赶至铁路线，一齐动手拆除。徐水农民则自动赶来一千多辆大车抢运枕木铁轨。刻平汉北段及平绥东段，铁轨枕木大部扫光，冰冻雪封的路基已被彻底破坏。"

In the Nanzhao, Nanyang, Fangcheng, and Wuyang areas, 760 bandits from the notorious bandit leader Wang Tingfan's and other units were eliminated. In the Sixth and Seventh Sub-districts, the suppression of bandits was combined with the mobilization of the masses. Emancipated peasants often spontaneously gathered in groups of hundreds or thousands to cooperate with the troops in encircling and suppressing bandit lairs.

    "content": "Weekly Comprehensive Battle Report\n    Comprehensive battle report for the week of January 15th to 21st:\n    Southern Front: On January 9th, the Tongbai Military Region's Liberation Army began besieging Deng County in southwestern Henan. By the morning of the 16th, they had completely annihilated eleven security regiments of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits within the city, totaling over 8,000 men. Deng County was a stronghold of reactionary landlord armed forces in southwestern Henan. When our army swept through the Funiu Mountains and advanced eastward to strike the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, the reactionary forces of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits from various counties successively fled to the Nanyang, Neixiang, and Deng County area, ultimately being captured by us. The victory at Deng County greatly benefited the liberation cause of the people of Henan. From then on, the reactionary local defense forces in Henan Province, regarded as treasures by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, were mostly annihilated. (Note: When the Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui Grand Army crossed the Longhai Railway to the south, they had already annihilated five regiments and one battalion out of the six security regiments of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits east of the Pinghan Railway in Henan Province. Since the Yu, Shaanxi, and Hubei Liberation Army crossed the river, they have annihilated all sixteen security regiments in Luoyang, Shan County, etc., and most of the thirteen security regiments in Luoning, Lushan, etc.).\n    The armed forces of the newly liberated peasants are actively cooperating with the main forces in combat, and their strength is growing daily. In the forty days from December to early January, the local armed forces of Yu, Shaanxi, and Hubei fought in Xin'an, Yiyang, Luoning, Lushi, Yun County, Yunxi, Nanzhao, Nanyang, Fangcheng, Wuyang, and along the Longhai Railway in over ninety battles, successively annihilating over two thousand local Chiang Kai-shek troops. The masses also actively searched for and suppressed small groups of reactionary landlord armed forces, with the Sixth and Seventh Military Sub-districts alone seizing nearly seven thousand rifles and short guns from three counties. In the east, the local armed forces captured Linru for the third time. The local armed forces of E, Yu, and Wan cooperated with the field army in sweeping away local Chiang Kai-shek troops in Huangpi, Xincai, and other areas, capturing six strongholds including Liuzigang and Baoxinji from the 5th to the 9th, and destroying forty li of roads.\n    In the past month, the Jianghan Military Region has established twelve democratic governments in Jingshan, Zhongxiang, Qianjiang, Tianmen, Jianli, Jingmen, Anlu, Yingcheng, Jiangling, Hongshan, Mianyang, and Sui County. Currently, the county governments are opening granaries to relieve poverty and helping peasants carry out land reform, enabling this fertile new area to take root quickly.\n    To coordinate with the southern front operations, our Ji-Lu-Yu local corps uprooted the isolated stronghold of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in the inner line, Dongping City, again on the evening of the 6th to the morning of the 7th, annihilating over 1,300 enemy troops, including Zhang Cenxiu, deputy brigade commander of the 3rd Security Brigade. The local armed forces in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have achieved brilliant victories. In the nine months from March to December of last year, they fought 3,064 battles, annihilating 14,000 enemy troops, equivalent to one-fourth of the 60,000 enemy troops annihilated by the Northwest Field Army during the same period. In constant active combat, they have tripled their strength and cooperated with the field army to recover large areas, independently maintaining and establishing new democratic regimes in the four counties of Zhong (bu), Yi (jun), @yi, @xian, Sanyuan and the three districts of Chishui. Around the New Year, guerrilla warfare was extremely active throughout Shandong Province. In Lu Zhong alone, over 3,100 enemy troops were annihilated in December. In Jiaodong, Lunan, Binhai and other areas, over 1,000 enemy troops were annihilated within ten days.\n    Northern Front, Northeast Battlefield: After our army annihilated three full divisions and one army headquarters of the enemy in Zhangwu and Gongzhutun, the isolated cities of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Shenyang, Changchun, and Jilin are increasingly trapped in a state of hunger and cold. On the 13th, our army again routed three regiments of the 96th Army and 60th Army of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, who had ventured out from Goubangzi, the connecting point of the Beining Line and Yingkou branch line, near Beizhen, northeast of Jinzhou, annihilating over 1,400 of them. The remnants fled in disarray. Prior to this, the Liberation Army had launched a sabotage campaign on the Goubangzi-Jinzhou section of the Beining Line from the 4th to the 7th of this month, completely annihilating the 200 or so enemy troops guarding the Shishan Station and other locations, and burning down the Guan Jia, Shishan, Yang Quan Zi and other stations.

    "content": "Regarding \"Singing War Songs and Remembering Xinghai\"\n    --A Critique of Capitulationism in Artistic Work\n  　A Self-Critique from the Editors of the Fourth Page of This Newspaper\n    On November 2nd, our newspaper's fourth page published an article by Comrade Ziguang entitled \"Singing War Songs and Remembering Xinghai.\" The viewpoints, stances, feelings, and thoughts expressed in it were problematic. Publishing such an article in a Party newspaper with such prominence was a serious mistake in our work, a mistake of losing our stance. This article was published after we had deleted and revised it, and in some places, reorganized the wording. However, the places that we revised and reorganized were still problematic. For example, the passage \"As the autumn breeze cools and the red leaves gradually fall...\" and the passage \"…our singing has become沉消了\" are both stale and decadent sentiments of the feudal literati class and the petty bourgeoisie. This not only shows that we lost our stance in publishing this article but also shows that the editors themselves have very serious problems in their thoughts and stances. Regarding the section about Comrade Xinghai working as a conductor for the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra, comparing it with the text that we deleted, it turns out that it wasn't the case. Although the original manuscript stated, \"He once conducted Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra,\" and later wrote, \"Unfortunately, good things are often hampered, and complications arose, and this work ultimately failed.\" This is certainly a significant manifestation of Comrade Ziguang's erroneous stance. At the same time, the fact that we editors didn't clarify this before deleting and publishing it further demonstrates our irresponsible work style. Under the slogan of opposing \"客里空\", we still did not raise our vigilance and give it enough importance.\n    In addition to asking Comrade Ziguang to conduct a self-critique of this article, we hereby make the above preliminary self-critique. We are willing to accept more criticism for areas where we are still unaware.\n    Comrade Ziguang's Self-Critique\n    (Omitted preceding text)\n    My motives for writing \"Singing War Songs and Remembering Xinghai\" were impure. Recalling my state of mind at the time, there were at least three thoughts. The first was to be in the limelight. Because Comrade Xinghai's posthumous works were brought back from the Soviet Union, and the Central Propaganda Department entrusted them to us for safekeeping, few people outside knew about these materials. I thought that if I wrote about them first, it would be exceptionally valuable, and I could also become a prominent figure in the domestic music scene. The second idea was to use the opportunity of commemorating Xinghai to express some feelings, stimulate the composers a bit, and promote the organization of colleagues in the music field as soon as possible to launch a creative upsurge and develop a new music movement. The third idea was to continue the past idea of writing a commemorative article for Xinghai every year, which would not only show respect and love for Comrade Xinghai but also take the opportunity to express my artistic views. Due to the above three ideas, I finally managed to write that article hastily in my spare time. Today, in retrospect, this is entirely personal heroism at work, without considering the needs of reality at all, and of course, it is even less about starting from the interests and demands of the people. Needless to say, a work produced under such impure motives must have many problems.\n    In that article, a basic viewpoint ran through from beginning to end, that is, formalism. Its essence is to emphasize technique and ignore content. (Is it just \"formalism\"? Its essence should be clearly recognized as capitulationism. – Editor) I admired Xinghai's skills and cultivation wholeheartedly, but when introducing Xinghai, I only focused on technique, everywhere promoting his greatness and achievements in this area, while giving a light touch to his hardworking spirit of serving the people and the lives and emotions of the working people reflected in his works. At the same time, this technical point of view has further developed into unprincipled comparison. In this comparison, I believe that Xinghai surpassed his pioneer, Nie Er. Indeed, this comparison is meaningless and incorrect. Because the two have their own historical backgrounds and historical conditions, how can Xinghai, who came later, be compared with Nie Er at that time? In fact, Nie Er's contributions to the history of the New Music Movement are brilliant and cannot be erased by anyone. We must not start from a technical point of view and use the new achievements of later generations to belittle or despise Nie Er, the pioneer of new music. What's more, Nie Er's works are still so popular and welcomed by the masses. How many people can catch up with him? This kind of unprincipled comparison is of no benefit to the New Music Movement (Is it just of no benefit to the \"New Music Movement\"? What about from the perspective of the workers and peasants? – Editor) On the contrary, it gives the opponents of the New Music Movement an opportunity to take advantage of. Strictly speaking, this is a statement that has lost its stance. In addition, my article also said that Xinghai's works have caught up with the international level. Needless to say, this is again from a technical point of view. (This is also a capitulationist view of aligning with the bourgeoisie. From the perspective of the proletariat, workers and peasants' art is also technically superior to the bourgeoisie. \"Technology\" that is detached from politics and transcends time and space does not exist. – Editor) Because when talking about the international level, I completely ignored Comrade Xinghai's contribution to the cause of the Chinese revolution. In fact, the four words \"international level\" are themselves a confused concept. This is a statement without a class stance. Obviously, the meaning of the word \"international\" includes European and American capitalist countries. May I ask, what qualifications does the art of capitalist countries have to compare with us? Our art is progressive, New Democratic, for the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and anti-imperialist and anti-feudal. Even our proletariat's crude creations or budding artworks are much better than those magnificent (Standing on what position to say it is \"magnificent\"? Is it really magnificent? – Editor) and soulless things in the ivory towers of imperialism or the bourgeoisie. It is a loss of stance to put forward the \"international level\" in general, and to be proud of Comrade Xinghai's creation catching up with the so-called \"international level\". In addition, when talking about Comrade Xinghai conducting the Fifth Symphony, I clearly knew that this matter had been brewing for a long time, that he could not go at first, then he was able to go, and finally it still did not succeed (What is this considered \"success\"? – Editor), but in order to emphasize the technique and promote Xinghai's high cultivation, I did not write frankly, but deliberately showed off my mystification, and talked about the result of this matter in a roundabout way. In the narrative, I only emphasized Xinghai's skills, and then said that foreigners condescended, then said that good things were often hampered, and finally said that it still failed. (What kind of \"good thing\" is this? This is a great insult to the people's artist! – Editor) This kind of writing is not only vague but also pretentious, as if it were really the case, even making the editor confused, so that a large paragraph of words behind it was deleted. As far as I am concerned, this is not only a technical point of view but also an irresponsible attitude towards readers, and it is also a concrete manifestation of impure Party spirit. At the same time, in the words, there is a sense of pride in \"foreigners condescending,\" and it also says \"the Kuomintang is incompetent\" and \"losing national dignity,\" etc. Although this is to explain that Xinghai's technology could not be developed in that kind of society, the language is chaotic, the class position is lost, the national position is unstable, and it can even be said to be a manifestation of capitulationism (It should be affirmatively said that it is a manifestation of capitulationism! – Editor), and it can also be said to be a manifestation of bourgeois ideology. In fact, neither the Kuomintang nor foreigners (The collective term for foreigners as \"foreigners\" is also a statement without class nature; the workers and peasants of capitalist countries are completely consistent with our Chinese proletariat. – Editor) can be compared with our proletariat at all. You must know that any emancipated farmer in our liberated area is much nobler than a foreigner holding the shackles of aggression or a senior Kuomintang bureaucrat holding the yoke of slaves. (Farmers who have not yet been emancipated are also noble. The imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek's party dogs are not noble at all. Saying that farmers are much nobler than them still admits that they are somewhat noble, and there are still remnants of capitulationism. – Editor)\n    In addition, when talking about creation, I expressed infinite emotion that the composers did not write good works, or even works like \"On the Taihang Mountains!\" (\"Composers,\" without the approval of the peasants, why call them \"composers?\" – Editor) In fact, there is no need to be sentimental. We should find out the reasons and overcome them, and naturally, many songs that the masses love to sing will be produced. Last time I only mentioned the phenomenon and did not analyze it. Today I will add a little bit. I think the reason why the composition world has not produced good works is mainly three: First, there is a lack of love for the people (referring to workers, peasants, and soldiers), and there is no wholehearted service to the people, and the spirit of \"willing to be an ox for the children\"; second, there is not enough understanding of the lives and emotions of the people (especially the poor and hired); third, the technical point of view (In fact, it is capitulationism. – Editor) Many music workers are studying the technology and theory of Western music, creating choruses, ensembles, and even symphonies, while despising mass songs, thinking they are simple and not interested. Due to the above three reasons, mass songs are naturally stillborn. To produce a large number of mass songs in the future, we must first overcome the above three shortcomings. Our music workers should put down their burdens and go to the masses, and with the spirit of \"willing to be an ox for the children,\" contact the masses in practical work, understand the masses, and reflect the struggles, lives, and emotions of the masses with the melodies, rhythms, and musical styles that the masses love most. (This is still to \"contact\" the masses in order to compose, and it is still not wholehearted work for the people. The result will still be a failure to understand the masses. – Editor) But don't stick to the old ways and copy the old ways, or imitate Western technology and forms. More importantly, we must boldly create musical works with national style and national sentiment that the masses love to hear and see, and that are fresh and lively.\n    Finally, our music circles should unite and organize to become a strong artistic front. At the same time, we must eliminate the influence of bourgeois artistic thought and the artistic tastes and emotions of the literati class from ourselves (We must first eliminate the thoughts of the feudal literati and the bourgeoisie before we can form a battle line. Moreover, this front should first be combined with the broad masses of the working people. When not wholeheartedly working for the people, the unity of the \"music circle\" can only form a small sect that confronts the peasants. As long as they are all wholeheartedly working for the people, they will naturally unite. – Editor), inherit the path of Nie Er and Xinghai, and establish national, mass, and scientific new music! This land reform study has given me many valuable class educations. I deeply feel that I am not worthy to be called a proletarian art worker. In the future, I will only strengthen class education, stand on the class position, work for the people, be a servant of the people, be loyal and honest, and serve the people wholeheartedly. I am willing to encourage myself with this, and at the same time, I hope that my comrades in the literary and art circles will encourage each other! This superficial self-critique is only the beginning of my self-critique in the field of creation. There are bound to be omissions and errors, and I hope that my comrades will give me more advice. I am extremely grateful!\n\n    (Editor's note: Comrade Ziguang has initially realized his mistakes after this study and is determined to work for the people, which is good. However, he still does not have enough understanding of the capitulationism in artistic thought, and his basic point of view is still far from the proletarian position. It is hoped that after reading this, everyone will continue to discuss this issue.)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 关于“高唱战歌念星海”——艺术工作上投降主义的检讨\n\n1948-01-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　关于“高唱战歌念星海”\n    ——艺术工作上投降主义的检讨\n  　本报第四版编辑同志的检讨\n    十一月二日，本报四版发表了紫光同志作“高唱战歌念星海”一篇文章。其中所表现的观点、立场，及感情、思想都是有问题的。这样一篇文章在党报上用显著的地位登出来，这是我们在工作上犯了一个严重的错误，是一个丧失立场的错误。这篇文章，是经过我们删改，有些地方在文字上经过重新的组织，最后把它发表出来的。而经过我们删改过，在文字上重新组织过的地方，都仍然是有问题的。如“当此秋风已凉，红叶渐落之时………”一段，及“………我们的歌声却消沉了”一段，都是陈腐不堪的封建士大夫阶级的和小资产阶级的感情。这样，不仅说明我们发表这篇文章，在工作上丧失了立场，而且说明我们编辑工作者本身的思想和立场，亦同时存在着十分严重的问题。关于星海同志在上海工部局管弦乐队担任指挥工作那一段，和被我们所删去的文字对照一下，原来并没有那么回事。虽然在原稿上，前面写着：“他曾经在上海工部局管弦乐队指挥过悲多汶的第五交响乐”，后面又写着：“可惜好事多磨，节外生枝，这件工作最后仍然流了产”，这固然是紫光同志立场错误的显著表现，同时，我们编辑同志并没有弄清楚就把它删掉发表，这更说明我们不负责任的工作作风，在反对客里空的口号下面，依然没有提起自己的警惕与足够的重视。\n    除请紫光同志对这篇文章作自我检讨外，我们谨作以上初步的检讨。还有认识不到的地方，愿接受大家更多的批评。\n    紫光同志的自我检讨\n    （前略）\n    我写“高唱战歌念星海”一文的动机，是不纯的。回忆一下当时的心情，至少有下面三种想法。第一种想法，是抢先出风头。因为星海同志的遗作，从苏联带回后，中宣部交给我们慎重保管，这些材料外界知者甚少，我想如果抢先写出，势必珍贵异常，自己在国内乐坛，也可出一风头。第二种想法，是借纪念星海的机会，发发感慨，刺激作曲家们一下，并推动音乐界同人，赶快组织起来，掀起一个创作热潮，开展新的音乐运动。第三种想法，是继续过去的想法，每年为星海写一篇纪念文章，既能表示对星海同志的敬仰与爱戴，又能借题发挥自己的艺术见解。由于以上三种想法，我终于忙里抽闲，仓促草率地写了那篇文章。今天检讨起来，这完全是个人英雄主义在作崇，根本没有考虑到现实的需要，当然更谈不上是从人民大众的利益与要求出发了。在这种不纯的动机下所产生的作品，不消说一定会有许多问题的。\n    在那篇文章里，由头到尾贯穿了一个基本观点，那就是形式主义。它的本质，就是强调技巧，忽视内容。（岂止是“形式主义”？应明确认识它的本质就是投降主义。——编者）对于星海的技巧与修养，我是佩服得五体投地，但在介绍星海时，我就只着重技术，处处都在宣扬他在这方面的伟大与成就，而对他那为人民大众服务的刻苦精神，及他在作品里反映的劳动人民的生活与情感，却轻描淡写不大重视。同时，这种技术观点，更发展成为无原则的比较。在这次比较中，我认为星海超过了他的先驱者聂耳。诚然，这种比较是毫无实际意义的，而且也是不正确的。因为两人各有各的时代背景，各有各的历史条件，怎么能拿后来的星海与当时的聂耳来比较呢？其实聂耳在新音乐运动史上的功绩，是光辉灿烂的，是任何人所不能抹煞的，决不能从技术观点出发，用后来者新的功绩，将新音乐的开路先锋——聂耳，贬低或轻视。更何况聂耳的作品，一直到现在还是那样普遍地流行，受到广大群众的欢迎，试问有几位能赶上他呢？这种无原则的比较，对新音乐运动，一点好处也没有（只是对“新音乐运动”没好处吗？从工农立场上看又如何？——编者）相反，倒给新音乐运动的反对者以可乘之机。严格检讨起来，这是失掉立场的言论。此外，我的文章中又说，星海的作品，已经赶上了国际水平。不消说，这又是从技术观点出发。（这也是向资产阶级看齐的投降主义的观点。从无产阶级的观点出发，工农艺术在技术上也是比资产阶级优越的，脱离政治超越时间空间的“技术”是不存在的。——编者）因为在谈到国际水平时，我把星海同志对中国革命事业的贡献，根本忽略未谈。其实，“国际水平”这四个字，本身就是个糊涂观念。这是没有阶级立场的说法。显然，“国际”这两个字的含义，包括了欧美资本主义国家在内。试问资本主义国家的艺术，有什么资格和我们相比啊？我们的艺术是进步的，新民主主义的，为工农兵大众的，反帝反封建的艺术。即使我们无产阶级粗糙的创造，或萌芽状态的艺术品，比起帝国主义或资产阶级象牙塔里的那些富丽堂皇（站在什么立场上说它“富丽堂皇”？真是富丽堂皇的吗？——编者）而没有灵魂的东西来，也要高明得多。笼统地提出“国际水平”来，而且以星海同志的创作赶上所谓“国际水平”为荣，这也是失掉立场的表现。此外在谈到星海同志指挥第五交响乐一事时，我明明知道此事酝酿了许久，最初不能去，后来又能够去，最后仍然没有成功（这算什么“成功”？——编者），但为了强调技术，宣扬星海的修养高明，我没有秉笔直言，却故意卖弄玄虚，转湾磨角地说出此事的结果。在叙述中，我光强调星海的技巧，继说洋人屈就，后说好事多磨，最后说仍然流产。（这算什么“好事”？这是对人民艺术家莫大的侮辱！——编者）这种文笔不但语句含混，而且装腔作势，仿佛真有其事似地，甚至使编辑同志都迷糊不清，以致把后面一大段话都删去了。在我讲来，这不但是技术观点，而且是对读者不负责任的态度，也是党性不纯的具体表现。同时，在言语之间，颇有以“洋人屈就”为荣之感，并且还说出“国民党无能”，“失去国格”等话，虽然这是为了说明星海的技术，在那样的社会中不能得到发展，但言语混乱，阶级立场丧失，民族立场不稳，甚至可说是投降主义的表现，（应肯定的说，就是投降主义的表现！——编者）也可以说是资产阶级思想的流露。其实无论是国民党，或者洋人，（笼统称外国人为“洋人”，也是没有阶级性的说法；资本主义国家的工农无产阶级和我们中国的无产阶级是完全一致的。——编者）就根本不能和我们无产阶级相提并论。要知道，我们解放区的任何翻身农民，比起手持侵略镣铐的洋人，或端着奴隶枷锁的国民党高级官僚，要高尚得多。（还没有翻身的农民也是高尚的。而帝国主义与蒋党狗官们则一点也不高尚。说农民比它们高尚得多、这仍是承认它有些高尚，仍是有投降主义残余的。——编者）\n    此外，在谈到创作的时候，我对作曲家们没有写出好作品，甚至连“太行山上”那样的作品都没有，表示了无限感慨！（“作曲家”在未经农民批准以前，凭什么称他们是“作曲家”？——编者）其实，用不着感慨，应当找出原因来，克服了那个原因，自然就可以产生出许多大众喜唱乐闻的歌声了。上次我只提了一下现象，没有分析论述。今天我略微补充一下。我以为作曲界所以没有产生好作品出来，其原因主要有三：一是缺乏对人民（指工农兵）的热爱，没有全心全意为人民服务，及“俯首甘为孺子牛”的精神；二是对人民（尤其对贫雇）的生活情感不够了解；三是技术观点，（其实是投降主义。——编者）许多音乐工作者在钻研西洋音乐的技术与理论，创作合唱曲合奏曲甚至交响曲，对群众歌曲轻视，认为简单，不发生兴趣。由于上面这三个原因，群众歌曲自然难产了。今后要产生大量的群众歌曲，首先要克服上面三个缺点。我们音乐工作者，应放下包袱，到群众中去，以“俯首甘为孺子牛”的精神，在实际工作中接触群众，了解群众，以群众所最喜爱的旋律节奏与乐式，来反映群众的斗争生活与情感。（这仍是为了作曲才去“接触”群众，仍不是全心全意为人民做长工，其结果也将仍然是了解不了群众。——编者）但千万不要墨守成规抄袭故道，或模仿西洋的技术与形式，更重要的，是我们要大胆创造群众所喜闻乐见的，新鲜活泼的，民族风格与民族情调的音乐作品。\n    最后，我们音乐界应当团结起来，组织起来，成为一条坚强的艺术战线，同时我们要从自己的身上肃清资产阶级艺术思想的影响，以及士大夫阶级的艺术趣味与情感，（必须先肃清封建士大夫与资产阶级的思想，然后才可能结成战线。而且这条战线首先应是和广大劳动人民相结合。在不是全心全意为人民当长工的时候，“音乐界”的团结只可能形成对抗农民的小宗派。只要都是全心全意为人民当长工的，就自然会团结一致。——编者）继承聂耳星海的道路，建立民族的大众的科学的新音乐！这次土改学习，给我许多宝贵的阶级教育，我深深感到自己不配称做无产阶级的艺术工作者，今后惟有加强阶级教育，站在阶级立场，为人民做长工，做人民的勤务员，忠诚老实，全心全意地为人民服务。我愿以此自勉，同时希望文艺界战友们，以此共勉！这次粗浅的检讨，只是我在创作方面检讨的开始，疏漏谬误之处，在所难免，还望同志们多多赐教，不胜感盼之至！\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    （编者按：紫光同志经过这次学习，初步认识到了自己的错误，决心为人民做长工，这是好的。但对于艺术思想上的投降主义认识得仍不够，基本观点仍和无产阶级立场有很大距离。希望大家读了以后继续展开对这问题的讨论。）"

    "content": "Military Industry Department Workers Volunteer Labor, Increasing Shell Production by 1,400 in One Month\n　　Taihang Factories and Mines Compete to Increase Production\n　　Fengmin Textile Factory Invents Cloth Pressing Machine\n　　[This newspaper's report] Under the slogans of \"Down with Chiang Kai-shek\" and \"Strive for New Victories in 1948,\" all the workers of the Military Region's Military Industry Department factories launched a fervent voluntary labor movement. The original plan was for each person to increase their voluntary labor by four workdays in January, producing an additional 1,000 shells, worth 30 million Jicha banknotes. However, based on the actual achievements of each individual, it is estimated that a total of 1,400 additional shells can be manufactured, worth 35 million Jicha banknotes.\n　　[Taihang News] Workers in many factories and mines in the Taihang Second and Third Special Districts have launched a production increase competition. Under the principles of \"Comprehensive Transformation\" and \"Comprehensive Improvement,\" more than 20,000 workers in the Second Special District proposed the action slogan of achieving \"Three Benefits\" (working hard to improve skills, achieving significant results that benefit both labor and capital, increasing production day and night to support the great counter-offensive) and achieving \"Five Goods\" (sufficient raw materials, large quantity, good quality, low cost, and wide sales). Workers in mines, paper mills, and textile factories in Xiangyuan's first, second, and fifth districts have formulated production increase plans and mutual inspection methods, launching a competition. Eight coal kilns in the Second District have formulated a seventy-day production increase plan, aiming to increase production by 4,400 baskets before the Lunar New Year, equivalent to 1.19 million yuan. Chen Qiying and Wang Ailian, two new female workers at the Chengguan Jianhua Textile Factory, increased their daily wool spinning output from ten liang to one jin each during the production increase movement. Each worker increased production by 11.4 jin in December. Weaving workers increased their monthly cloth output from 45 zhang to 50 zhang. The characteristic of the production increase movement in Heshun is mutual assistance between workers and peasants, with workers producing more coal and peasants providing large-scale transportation. According to recent production increase figures, it is estimated that over a hundred days, each miner can earn eight more shi of coarse grains than before. The alum production industry in the county has greatly developed this winter, increasing from fourteen workshops to thirty-eight. In the first half of the year, each workshop produced 10,000 jin of alum per month, but now it has increased to 15,000 jin. They have also created a method of using black alkali instead of grass ash for alum production, which is simple to use, highly effective, and saves raw materials. After Li Chunshou and Ma Yunshan of the Fengmin Textile Factory of the Yushe County Cooperative successfully researched and developed a cloth pressing machine, they then created a hand-pulled shuttle double machine, which can replace two machines and save one person's labor. The quantity of products exceeded 65% of the previous amount. After the coarse cloth is pressed by the cloth pressing machine, it becomes smooth and neat, and the quality is improved, immediately expanding sales. Recently, the factory extracted 19 machines and 12 apprentices to go to various villages to help develop the rural textile industry and provide technical guidance. All 146 factories and mines in Lucheng in the Third Special District have participated in the movement.

According to TASS: US imperialism has dispatched a large number of warships to reinforce the Mediterranean, including the aircraft carrier \"Midway,\" carrying 2,000 Marines and several cruisers, preparing to land in Greece if necessary to help the Athens puppet government make a last-ditch struggle or suppress the increasingly high tide of the Italian democratic movement. At the same time, the United States has increased aid to Greece for military spending, actively helping the Athens puppet government expand its army, and frantically suppressing the labor movement. This has aroused the indignation of democratic people around the world, and a movement to aid Greece is booming. The Executive Board of the United Food and Tobacco Workers Union of the CIO in Philadelphia, USA, with 100,000 members, passed a resolution protesting this outrage by the US authorities and demanded that Truman and the State Department \"stop all economic and military aid to the Greek royalist government.\" In order to support the Greek democratic movement, the broad masses of the people of Yugoslavia established the People's Committee to Aid Greece in Belgrade a few days ago. At the closing of the Sixth National Congress of the Italian Communist Party, Italian Communist leader Togliatti called on the Italian people to support the Greek Democratic Army. The Austrian Association of Anti-Fascist Fighters for Freedom held a meeting in Vienna, the capital of Austria, on the 13th to support Greece's struggle for independence and freedom.

On the 16th, when the village cadres discussed the Administrative Office's proclamation, Political Director Wang Zhuyuan said before the words had even faded, \"The landlord Niu Faqi is undermining our Land Law. Yesterday, he secretly sold a tung tree from the lumber mill.\" Then Chen Shuqi also said, \"The feudal rich peasant Niu Gun's heard about the equal distribution of land and is rushing to sell his flock of sheep.\" Discovering these two things, the village cadres became more vigilant about the destructive activities of the landlords. That night, they convened a small-scale cooperative of the entire village to check the things the landlords had secretly sold and the shares of the people. They discovered many more things: The shares of the landlords Niu Qingwen and Niu Yuanzhou in the small-scale cooperative amounted to 61,000 yuan, and they secretly took away 45,000 yuan the day before. The landlord Chen Guibao hid a donkey at his relatives' house. Wang Shouyi secretly sold a small donkey. The landlord Niu Jizhao was recklessly prostituting himself, cutting away the paper mulberry bark already distributed to the poor peasants, and the peasants dared not say anything. Some landlords even altered our slogans. Now these things have all been registered, ready to be dealt with when the land is equally distributed.\n    Editor's note: It is very good that the village cadres are paying attention to and are vigilant about the landlords' violation of the Land Law. However, it is more important to earnestly and deeply penetrate among the poor and hired peasants, and patiently explain and interpret the law to them. Only when the poor and hired peasants consciously grasp the weapon of the land can they more forcefully stop the landlords' sabotage and make ideological preparations for the upcoming land distribution movement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 土地法不容破坏！　白芟登记地主非法行为\n\n1948-01-23\n第1版()\n专栏：批评与建议\n\n　　土地法不容破坏！\n  　白芟登记地主非法行为\n    【太行消息】涉县七区白芟村拿太行行署禁止破坏土地法的布告作武器，制止地主变卖埋藏财物的非法行为。十六号该村村干部讨论行署布告时，声音未落，政治主任王竹元就说：“地主牛发其破坏咱们的土地法，昨天找木工厂偷卖桐树一棵”。接着陈树其也说：“封建富农牛滚的听到土地平分，正急着卖他那一群羊”。发现了这两宗事情，村干部对地主的破坏活动更警惕起来，当天黑夜便召集全村小型合作社，检查地主偷卖的东西和人的股金，又发现了好多事情：地主牛庆文、牛元周在小型合作社存的股金有六万一千元，前日偷取去四万五千元。地主陈贵保在他亲戚家隐藏着一头驴。王守义偷卖了一头小驴。地主牛计召嫖猖狂，把已分给贫民的楮皮割去，农民不敢吭声。有些地主甚至擦改我们的标语，现在这些事情都已登记起来，准备平分土地时处理。\n    按编者：村干部注意与警惕了地主破坏土地法这是很好的。但是，更重要的是认真深入贫雇，向他们耐心的宣传解释；只有贫雇自觉的掌握了土地个武器，才能更有力的制止地主的破坏，并给就要到来的都分土地运动，作了的思想准备。"

At that time, the main war aim of the US and Britain was to eliminate German competition in the world market and establish the rule of US and British monopoly capital.

The Secretariat of the German People's Congress decided to convene a Standing Committee on the 15th to discuss the urgent task of fighting for German unity and a just peace. The leadership of the Communist Party in the British-occupied zone resolved: \"They (referring to the figures participating in the Frankfurt Conference) are attempting to make Germany completely dependent on American monopoly capitalists and turn Germany into a colony based on those plans. The Frankfurt resolution on the establishment of a West German government will continue to worsen our economic situation.\" The resolution forcefully stated: \"The German question should only be decided by the German people themselves. As long as all the people are united, they will certainly be able to thwart the plans of the splitters.\" The Secretariat of the Communist Party of Bavaria in the American-occupied zone resolved to strongly denounce \"the Frankfurt Resolutions as a tool for dividing Germany; they are attempting to establish the rule of large enterprises and landlords in western Germany.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 14th: TASS: The National Federation of Deportees and Detainees from France during the German occupation, as well as anti-fascist resistance fighters and patriots, recently held its third national congress in Lyon.

A comprehensive dispatch from Rome: The Italian people's democratic movement continues to expand, and the land reform movement is also surging. Following major cities such as Milan, Turin, Genoa, Pescara, and Florence, the Brescia city (belonging to the Lombardy province) has also established a local organization of the People's Democratic Front. Leaders of the Italian Communist Party and Socialist Party, the Christian Socialist Party, the Garibaldi Guerrilla Brigade, and representatives of various democratic groups participated. A branch of the Southern Italian People's Democratic Front has also been established in Andria, Bari province. In the past two weeks, the movement of Italian peasants and agricultural workers demanding land reform has spread throughout Italy. Agricultural workers in Pezenza (southeast of Milan) occupied a large area of \"state-owned land\" in the Po River basin and jointly cultivated it. Agricultural workers in Verona, the province of Pesaro (central Italy, on the Adriatic coast), and the province of Catanzaro (southern Italy) rose up and occupied large amounts of land and, in the manner of factory management committees, organized \"land committees\" to manage the occupied land themselves. Recently, 10,000 agricultural workers in Venice continued their strike, demanding jobs for the unemployed. Agricultural workers and the unemployed also held large demonstrations in Treviso (north of Venice) and Venice. Fifty thousand agricultural workers participated in a strike in the province of Naples. Agricultural workers in the Maga area also went on strike on the 12th, demanding the revision of the enslaving tenancy agreements with landlords. On the same day, the Sicilian Peasants' Congress convened in Palermo, with 2,000 Italian peasant representatives demanding land participating. The congress passed a resolution instructing the land committees to launch a struggle to demand land. Strikes and demonstrations by the Italian working people have emerged in other cities. On the 15th, five hundred disabled veterans demonstrated in front of the Rome Central Police Station, protesting the reactionary government's indifference to their plight and demanding increased pensions and welfare. The working people of Milan, under the leadership of the Italian Communist Party, also held demonstrations in support of the fifteen soldiers from Verona who were arrested during a demonstration protesting the reactionary government's postponement of demobilization. L'Unità warned the reactionary government, saying: \"If the arrested are not released immediately, there will be a greater expression tomorrow.\" The western Italian port of Livorno announced a general strike in protest against unemployment. Six thousand workers from 140 factories of the Montecatini chemical trust (northwest of Florence, Italy), demanding \"production bonuses,\" held a continuous two-hour strike struggle for twelve days and have won victory.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 民主运动继续扩大深入　意农民占领大量土地　组织土地委员会自己来管理\n\n1948-01-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　民主运动继续扩大深入\n  　意农民占领大量土地\n  　组织土地委员会自己来管理\n    【新华社陕北二十日电】综合罗马讯：意大利人民民主运动继续扩大，土地改革运动也风起云涌。继米兰、都灵、热那亚、贝斯加拉、佛罗伦萨等大城市后，布里西亚市（属隆巴第省）亦已成立人民民主阵线地方组织。有意共、社会党诸领袖、基督教社会党、加黎波的游击旅以及各民主团体代表参加。意南方人民民主阵线支部也已在巴利省的安得利亚城成立。过去二周，意农民与农业工人要求土地改革的运动遍及全意，配森萨（米兰东南）城的农业工人占领波河流域大片“国有土地”，并进行联合耕种。未罗那城、比莎洛省（意中、滨亚德里亚海）以及加坦萨罗省（意南）等地农业工人，奋起占领了大量土地，并按照工厂管理委员会的方式，组织了“土地委员会”，由农业工人自己来管理已占领的土地。最近在威尼斯有一万农业工人继续罢工，要求予失业者以工作。农业工人与失业者并曾在特里维索（威尼斯北）和威尼斯举行了大示威，五万名农业工人参加了那不勒斯省的罢工。马加区的农业工人也于十二日进行罢工，要求修改与地主订立的奴役性的佃约。同日西西里农民大会于巴勒摩开会，有要求土地的意农民代表两千人参加。大会通过决议，训令土地委员会发动为要求土地而进行斗争。在其它城市，意劳动人民的罢工及示威层出不穷。五百名残废退伍军人十五日在罗马中央警察局前示威，抗议反动政府对他们的困苦漠不关心，并要求增加抚恤和养老金。米兰劳动人民在意共领导下也进行了示威，声援在抗议反动政府延期复员示威中被捕的未罗那城的十五个军人。团结报警告反动政府称：“如果不立即释放被捕者，明日将有更重大的表示”。意西部港口勒洪顷宣布总罢工，抗议失业。蒙得克迪尼（意佛罗伦萨西北）化学托辣斯一百四十个工厂六万工人，要求“生产奖金”，曾举行持续十二天的每日二小时罢工斗争，已赢得胜利。"

We said that the Marshall Plan was a plan to enslave Europe, a plan by American monopolists to turn Europe into a tool for conspiracies in the event of a crisis in the United States. This decision once again proves that the American ruling class, in planning their \"aid,\" is only concerned with the interests of American monopolists, and they are striving to force Western European countries to adapt their economies to the economic fluctuations of the United States. The observer continued: American expansionists are also attempting to consolidate their political power in Western Europe. To this end, a large army composed of \"special supervisors\" will be sent to Western European countries to supervise the \"implementation\" of the Marshall Plan. These supervisors, numbering about four or five thousand, will include various experts in finance, economics, customs, etc. This large army of supervisors will be subordinate to the military missions composed of U.S. military attachés stationed in the \"beneficiary countries,\" as well as representatives of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (American secret service).\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 消息报国际观察家评论：  马歇尔“援欧”计划是奴役欧洲的阴谋\n\n1948-01-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　消息报国际观察家评论：\n    马歇尔“援欧”计划是奴役欧洲的阴谋\n    【新华社陕北二十日电】莫斯科讯：消息报国际观察家顷评论称：美国政府决定，向国会提出只是十五个月的，而不是象前此所假定的四年“援欧”计划。美政府的这一决定，显示了苏联和欧洲民主人士的警告是如何适时而有远见，我们曾说马歇尔计划是奴役欧洲的计划，是美国垄断家在万一美国发生危机时，把欧洲变为一个进行阴谋之工具的计划。这一决定再一次证明了美国统治阶级在计划他们的“援助”时，只是关心美国垄断家的利益，并且他们正努力强迫西欧各国使其经济适应于美国的经济波动。观察家继称：美国扩张主义者亦企图巩固他们在西欧的政治势力。为了这一目的，由“特别监察员”所组成的大军，将要开到西欧各国，以监督马歇尔计划的“实行”。这些监察员约有四、五千人，其中包括财政、经济、关税等各种专家，这一监察员所组成的大军将隶属于美国驻于“受惠国家”之武官所组成的军事使团以及联邦调查局（美国特务机关）的代表。"

In order to salvage the crisis of the Pingbao line and rescue Baoding, Bandit Fu dispatched the entire 16th Army, the 94th Army, the Provisional 3rd Army, and two divisions of the 35th Army, along with the 12th Brigade of the 4th Cavalry Division, to reinforce Baoding along the west side of the Pingbao Railway. Along the way, they encountered fierce resistance and flanking attacks from our army. By the 10th, the enemy's main force had converged in the northwest of Baoding, attempting to disrupt the Mancheng and Wanxian areas. At the same time, our powerful forces launched a surprise attack on Laishui, completely occupying the four passes on the evening of the 11th. Bandit Fu hurriedly redeployed the main force of the 35th Army, which was reinforcing Baoding, to the north to reinforce Laishui. On the 12th, the enemy advanced to Zhuangtuan (erroneously reported as Zhuangding in yesterday's telegram) southeast of Laishui and was encircled by our army. After 16 hours of fierce fighting, the main force of the New 32nd Division of the enemy's 35th Army in Zhuangtuan, including the division headquarters, most of the 94th and 96th Regiments, part of the 95th Regiment, and an entire mountain artillery company directly under the division, as well as a howitzer battalion directly under the 35th Army, were annihilated by us. The remaining enemy, about a thousand strong, fled to the Lijiacun area northwest of Gaobeidian and was again intercepted and largely annihilated by another unit of our army. The enemy's 101st Division, which advanced to Wucun, was also severely attacked by us, suffering losses, and fled towards Dingxing and Gaobeidian. The Provisional 17th Division of the 35th Army, which was reinforcing from Zhuoxian to the west, was also repelled by us in the northeast of Laishui. By this point, the main force of Bandit Fu's 35th Army, the New 32nd Division, had been largely annihilated, and the 101st Division had also suffered losses. In this battle, we killed or wounded over 2,000 enemy soldiers, including the commander of the New 32nd Division, Li Mingding (killed), the commander of the 94th Regiment, Duan Xixiang, and the deputy commander, Bai Hongjun. We captured over 1,570 enemy soldiers, seized one howitzer, two mountain guns, six mortars, twenty 60mm mortars, six grenade launchers, 139 light and heavy machine guns, over 1,080 rifles, 135 American-made submachine guns, seven grenade launchers, over 80 vehicles, and some ammunition.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 21st – The Jin-Cha-Ji Daily published an editorial celebrating the great victory of the sabotage campaign on the northern Jin-Cha-Ji front, saying: The large-scale sabotage campaign by the Liberated Army against the four major railways of PingSui, PingHan, BeiNing, and JinPu has not only shattered the transportation between Tianjin, Beijing, and Baoding in the heart of North China, but has also disrupted the entire deployment of the Chiang-Fu bandit army. The Liberated Army annihilated most of Bandit Fu's old establishment, the New 32nd Division of the 35th Army, parts of the 101st Division and the howitzer battalion directly under the army, as well as a regiment of the Provisional 11th Division of the Provisional 3rd Army, and part of the Provisional 26th Division of the Provisional 4th Army, in Zhuangtuan east of Laishui on the northern section of the PingHan Railway and in the Yanqing and Yongning areas on the eastern section of the PingSui Railway, and killed Li Mingding, the commander of the New 32nd Division. The so-called \"active tactics\" that Bandit Fu Zuoyi has been clamoring about for a long time have been declared bankrupt.

TASS, New York, January 18th: The American Communist Party held a mass meeting of 8,000 people here on the 14th to commemorate the 24th anniversary of Lenin's death. American Communist leader Foster delivered a speech at the meeting, stating, \"The monopolistic capitalists of Wall Street are instigating an anti-Soviet war, which can only lead to the greatest military disaster in our history.\" He vehemently criticized Truman for engaging in war provocation in addition to conducting deceptive propaganda domestically. He pointed out, \"The United States is directing the wars in Greece and China.\" Foster emphatically stated, \"The new party will awaken millions of voters disappointed with the Democratic and Republican parties, and attract many votes among blacks, farmers, and workers.\" The audience cheered enthusiastically for Foster. American Communist Party General Secretary Dennis, amidst thunderous applause, continued by saying, \"Wallace's participation in the presidential election as a candidate of the new party marks the establishment of a new anti-war, anti-monopoly capital party in the United States.\" Dennis condemned the Social Democratic Party as careerists who divide workers. He warned that the CIO (Congress of Industrial Organizations) is in danger because it supports the labor movement advisor in the U.S. intervention mission in Greece. He strongly criticized CIO Secretary Carey and AFL (American Federation of Labor) European representative Brown for trying to form \"a large trade union of European countries under the Marshall Plan.\" Black Communist Party City Councilor Davis pointed out at the meeting, \"Black people will strongly support the new party across the United States.\"\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 15th. TASS, New York: The \"American Progressive Citizens Association\" recently told the press that it is scheduled to hold its second National Congress in Chicago on the 17th and 18th of this month. Six hundred representatives from twenty-six states will attend the conference, representing approximately 100,000 members. It is expected that the conference will support Wallace's presidential campaign and formulate specific plans. The conference will also formulate this year's political action program and elect the association's leaders. Democratic newspapers emphasized that no matter how the reactionary American newspapers spread rumors and propaganda, saying that the association has differing opinions on supporting Wallace, the association remains united. The association's monthly magazine, when discussing the work of this conference, said that the main purpose of the conference is to prevent the United States from heading towards economic depression and war. It also stated, \"We should show the world that tens of millions of Americans yearn for peace and hope for democracy.\" At the same time, the Executive Committee of the American Labor Party has also resolved to support Wallace's campaign and unanimously elected Congressman Marcantonio as the acting chairman of the party. In his speech to the Executive Committee, Marcantonio severely criticized Truman's recent message to Congress requesting universal military training and \"aid\" to reactionary governments around the world, and said: \"Truman's speech finally proves that the two-party system is gone forever.\"\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 17th. The movement to establish a new party and nominate Wallace as a presidential candidate is unfolding in the United States. According to a TASS report from New York, American democratic forces have already begun to carry out concrete work in this regard. The \"Pennsylvania Progressive Committee\" has already announced its establishment. The committee consists of two hundred informal representatives from local unions of the CIO, the AFL, the Railroad Brotherhoods, as well as farmers, students, veterans and other groups. In its statement, the committee strongly urged the convening of a National People's Congress to establish a new party.

US Communist Party leaders Foster and General Secretary Dennis jointly signed a statement to the press on the 18th, demanding that this unreasonable verdict be revoked and that Attorney General Clark be dismissed. The statement pointed out: \"The attempt to exile Bittelman is part of a fascist action, which is not only against the Communist Party, but also against organized workers, foreigners, Jews, and all progressive people.\" Its purpose is to prepare for \"a new suppression of the people of the whole country\" in order to \"realize the military plans\" and expansion plans of \"'bipartisan unity' (referring to the collusion between the Democratic and Republican parties).\" The statement condemned: \"It is not Bittelman who threatens the democratic system and the American democratic tradition, but Clark.\" The statement called on all freedom-loving Americans to rise up and fight for the removal of Clark and the cancellation of Bittelman's deportation case.\n　　\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 21st: TASS Moscow dispatch: Pravda recently published Isakov's impressions of his visit to the United States in an article entitled \"America Today,\" stating that Wall Street banks and industrial monopolists are pushing the United States onto the road of fascism. Anti-communist slander and the so-called detection of \"dangerous ideas\" have reached their peak. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Gestapo-style despicable network of spies is all over the United States. Today, what tightly entangles this country is a heavy atmosphere of depression and a very serious spy phobia. The ruling group in the United States keeps talking about \"democracy,\" \"human rights,\" and \"freedom of speech,\" but the more they say, the less democracy and freedom are left in the United States. The article pointed out: The united rule of Wall Street merchants and soldiers is a typical characteristic of today's American political life. After making a fortune from arms, big manufacturers have developed the wild idea of controlling the rest of mankind. They want to indefinitely prolong the post-war unrest in order to profit from the crisis. The article concluded: But among the general public in the United States, among intellectuals, there are warriors loyal to the traditions of Lincoln and Roosevelt. The rampant reaction often produces the opposite of what the fascists expect.

This budget clearly exposes the aggressive greed of US imperialism. The total expenditure is 39.669 billion US dollars, of which the army, navy and air force expenditure accounts for 28 percent, that is, 11.209 billion US dollars; international expenses account for 18 percent, that is, 7 billion US dollars (of which 4.5 billion US dollars are used for \"aid to Europe\"); the sum of these two items accounts for more than 46 percent of the total budget, that is, more than 18 billion US dollars. In terms of national income: Truman's proposed budget hopes to increase the total tax revenue to 42.155 billion US dollars, with other miscellaneous income of 2.3 billion US dollars. It is said that as a result of the new budget, the defense cost borne by each American citizen increased from 8 yuan in 1938 to 75 yuan in 1949; the international expenses borne by each American citizen increased from 15 cents in 1939 to 48 yuan in 1949.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-23",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 21st: Shanghai report: In November of last year, MacArthur's headquarters and Japanese government officials successively announced a \"startling news,\" saying that there was a \"secret government\" in Japan, and that the American occupation forces and their so-called \"Japan reform plan\" were being \"severely threatened\" by this so-called \"secret government's\" \"extensive underground movement.\" MacArthur's real intention in this trick is to deliberately create a chaotic situation and a tense atmosphere, in order to prove that the American imperialists must occupy Japan indefinitely. This point has now been exposed by commentators in Shanghai. According to the news of the so-called Japanese \"secret government,\" it was officially reported by MacArthur's headquarters in November last year. Colonel Cardo, deputy chief of the American military government, declared in a statement: The current basic political struggle is being carried out \"between the supremacy of law and the secret rule of bandits. The latter is using figures from various camps such as former diplomats, members of parliament, and industrialists.\" At the same time, confidants of Japanese Prime Minister Katayama explained that these underground lurking elements were former army and navy officers. They were unwilling to accept defeat, so they organized an underground government. A Japanese government spokesman explained this fact as \"a natural product of the failure to restore economic stability after the war.\" In order to resist this situation, \"some Japanese leaders even advocated that the American occupation forces should not withdraw even after the peace treaty is signed.\" Commentators in Shanghai believe that this remark by the Japanese spokesman, who was described by Reuters' Tokyo correspondent at the time as \"closest to Prime Minister Katayama,\" has completely revealed the conspiracy of the reactionaries of the United States and Japan. The person pointed out: The entire conspiracy of the American imperialists is to occupy Japan for a long time as a base for aggression against the eastern nations. This conspiracy is not only manifested in the propaganda of the so-called \"Japanese secret government,\" but also in MacArthur's entire policy of deliberately creating a domestic political and economic crisis in Japan, and the Japanese army and navy officers, former diplomats, members of parliament, industrialists, etc., who are related to the \"secret government\" and accused of being used by bandits, are not being used by any other bandits, but are being used by MacArthur, the number one bandit. It is no longer a secret that MacArthur not only indulges but also actively uses this group of war criminals to play the puppet show of mutual infighting with his other group of lackeys such as Katayama, so that the United States can delay the occupation period as much as possible in the chaos.\n　　The person further pointed out: MacArthur's strategy is consistent with the rumors that MacArthur suggested to Marshall. MacArthur suggested that the time for the occupation of Japan must be extended, and for this purpose, the signing of a peace treaty with Japan must be delayed under various pretexts. MacArthur believes that the United States must maintain American naval and air bases in Japan, China, and Korea, and even after the signing of a peace treaty with Japan, the United States should still retain its military power in order to completely consolidate the United States' position in the Far East. MacArthur also believes that in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to continue to deepen the deterioration of the political and economic situation in Japan and strengthen the propaganda of the tense situation in Japan, so that public opinion feels that the long-term occupation of Japan by the United States is forced and justified. Commentators in Shanghai especially reminded the Chinese people to pay attention to MacArthur's conspiracy, which is now actively unfolding, and the unreasonable actions of the US government regarding the peace conference with Japan, deliberately using the cancellation of the four-power veto and convening the so-called eleven-nation conference to replace the four-nation conference, making the peace conference with Japan impossible to start, are completely in line with this conspiracy. The US policy of delaying the peace treaty with Japan obviously serves the same purpose as its policy of occupying Japan, that is, to occupy Japan indefinitely to invade the eastern nations.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 19th: Comprehensive reports from various sources: The US imperialists' ambition to vigorously promote the growth of Japanese aggressive forces is even more rampant. The Far East Economic Group, under MacArthur's control, decided on the 7th that after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, Japan could produce 5.5 million tons of steel annually (Note: equivalent to the level of steel production in 1933-1935 before the Japanese bandits launched the \"July 7th Incident\"). On the 10th, MacArthur's headquarters approved the Los Angeles Yallars Import and Export Company and the Japan Foreign Trade Bureau to sign a trade contract worth 7 million US dollars for steel and coal. The contract stipulates that Japan will exchange 20,000 tons of steel plates and 5,000 tons of waste electrical steel plates for 320,000 tons of American coking coal, and the first batch of 8,500 tons of coal shipped from the United States to Japan arrived in Japan on the same day. It is generally believed that this is a signal for Japan to rebuild large-scale world trade. At the same time, American banks such as \"Citibank,\" \"American,\" and \"Import and Export\" are conducting new loan negotiations with Japanese businessmen. In order to facilitate Japanese financial groups to conduct comprador-like transactions directly and openly with US monopoly capital, the Katayama cabinet's Standing Committee recently decided that banks affiliated with Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda can be exempted from the \"Economic Decentralization Act\"; Nakajima Kumakichi, chairman of the Japan Foreign Trade Association, even advocated that the Japanese economy \"merge into the US economic system.\" Under the policy of \"close cooperation\" between Japanese financial groups and American gold dollars, Japan's economic aggression against foreign countries (especially the Chiang-controlled area) will become even more rampant. \"Asahi Shimbun\" revealed on the 5th that Katayama, in his \"Five-Year Economic Stabilization Plan,\" expects Japan's total exports this year to be 519 million US dollars (last year Japan's total exports were 491 million US dollars, and the main export product was cotton textiles), and imports will reach 781 million US dollars. By 1952, exports will increase sharply to 1.395 billion US dollars, and imports will increase to 1.494 billion US dollars. And the United States is the biggest profit sucker in this trade. The New York Herald Tribune commented on the US imperialists' strengthening of control over the Japanese economy and openly confessed, \"Japan has now actually become a protectorate of the United States.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美阴谋长期占领日本　作为侵略东方各民族的基地\n\n1948-01-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美阴谋长期占领日本\n  　作为侵略东方各民族的基地\n    【新华社陕北二十一日电】上海讯：去年十一月间麦克阿瑟总部与日本政府官员曾先后宣布一项“惊人消息”，说日本存在着一个“秘密政府”，而美国占领军及其所谓“对日改革方案”则正受着这个所谓“秘密政府”的“广泛地下运动”的“严重威胁”。麦克阿瑟这个把戏的真实企图乃是故意制造混乱的形势与紧张的空气，借以证明美国帝国主义者必须无限期地占领日本。此点现已为上海评论界人士所揭破。按所谓日本“秘密政府”的消息，系于去年十一月由麦克阿瑟总部正式报导。美国军政府副长官卡道上校于声明中宣称：目前的基本政治斗争是进行在“法律至上与匪徒的秘密统治之间。后者正利用过去的外交官、议会议员及工业家等各阵营人物”。同时，日本首相片山的亲信们则解释称：这些地下潜伏分子，乃是过去的陆海军官。他们不愿接受战败，所以组织地下政府。日本政府发言人解释这个事实是“战争之后未恢复经济稳定前所有的自然产物”。为了抵抗这个情势，“若干日本领袖甚至主张签订和约后美国占领军也不能撤退”。上海评论界人士认为此一被路透社驻东京记者当时描写为“最为片山首相接近的”日本发言人的谈话，实已将美日两国反动派的阴谋和盘托出。该人士指出：美国帝国主义者的全部阴谋就是长期占领日本作为侵略东方各民族的基地。这个阴谋不仅表现于所谓“日本秘密政府”的宣传，并且表现于麦克阿瑟故意制造日本国内政治经济危机的全部政策，而所谓与“秘密政府”有关并被控为受匪徒利用的日本陆海军官、前外交官、议会议员、工业家等，并不是被任何旁的匪徒所利用，恰恰就是被麦克阿瑟这个头号匪徒所利用。麦克阿瑟不但放纵并且积极利用这批战犯，使他们与他的另一批走狗片山等人扮演互相混战的傀儡戏，以便美国在混乱之中尽量拖延占领期，这早已不是秘密了。\n    该人士进一步指出：麦克阿瑟的这个策略与外传麦氏向马歇尔的建议是相符合的。麦氏建议必须延长占领日本的时间，为此并须在各种借口下拖延签订对日和约。麦氏认为美国在日本、中国和朝鲜必须保有美国海空军基地，甚至即在签订对日和约以后，仍应保留美国的军事力量，这样才能完全巩固美国在远东的地位。麦氏又认为，为达到此项目的就必须继续加深日本政治、经济情况的恶化，并加强宣传日本的紧张形势，使舆论觉得美国长期占领日本是被迫的和正当的。上海评论界人士特别提醒中国人民注意麦克阿瑟的这一阴谋现在积极展开，而美国政府关于对日和会故意借取消四强否决权与召开所谓十一国会议以代替四国会议的无理取闹行动，使对日和会无从开起，正与这一阴谋完全合拍。美国关于拖延对日和会的政策，显然与其占领日本的政策服务于同一目的，即无限期占领日本以侵略东方各民族。\n    【新华社陕北十九日电】综合各方讯：美帝国主义力促日本侵略势力成长之野心，更形猖獗。在麦克阿瑟一手控制下的远东经济小组于七日决定，待对日和约签订后，日本每年可产钢五百五十万吨（按：相当于一九三三——三五年日寇发动“七七事变”前夕之产钢水平）。十日麦克阿瑟总部即批准洛杉矶雅拉斯进出口公司与日本对外贸易局签订价值七百万美元之钢铁与煤的贸易合同。该合同规定：日本以二万吨钢板和五千吨废电钢板，交换三十二万吨美国焦煤，美国输日首批八千五百吨煤已于同日运抵日本。一般认为这是日本重建大规模世界贸易之信号。与此同时，美国“花旗”、“美利坚”、“进出口”等银行又与日商进行新的贷款谈判。为便于日本财阀能与美独占资本直接和公开地进行买办性交易计，片山内阁常委会于最近决定，三井、三菱、住友、安田所属银行，可不受“经济分散法案”之约束；日本对外贸易协会主席中岛久马吉甚至主张日本经济“并入美国经济体系中”，在日本财阀与美国金元“密切合作”政策下，日本对外（特别是对蒋管区）之经济侵略将更形嚣张。“朝日新闻”五日透露：片山于其“五年经济稳定计划”中，预料本年度日本输出总额为五亿一千九百万美元（按去年日本输出总额为四亿九千一百万美元，输出品主要系棉织物），输入将达七亿八千一百万美元，至一九五二年输出将急增至十三亿九千五百万美元，输入增至十四亿九千四百万美元。而此项贸易美国乃最大之利润吸吮者。纽约先驱论坛报评美帝加强控制日本经济时，公开自供称：“日本现在实际上已成为美国的保卫国”。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency,豫陕鄂 Frontline, 21st: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has created a scoring method in the merit and good deed recording movement, which has now become a mass movement of self-education and self-management. Initially, Guo Xiaofeng of the famous Wang Anguo Model Class researched a \"Profit and Loss Chart\" for regularly recording merits, recording each comrade's merits daily as a certain number of points, and deducting a certain number of points for errors. Later, after further research by everyone, a more refined \"Point Increase and Decrease Chart\" was created, and based on past experience, the \"Three Records\" movement of recording points, recording good deeds, and recording merits was launched. The regulations stipulate that good deeds are recorded as points every day, bad deeds are deducted points, ten points constitute one good deed, three good deeds constitute one minor merit, three minor merits constitute one average merit, three average merits constitute one major merit, and three major merits constitute one special merit. This method not only adapts to the level of activists but also to the level of backward elements, and does not bury anyone's slightest achievement. Even backward elements, accumulating day by day, can become heroes and models. For example, Luo An, a soldier in a certain regiment, had performed very poorly in the past, but since the \"Three Records\" movement was launched, he gradually corrected his past shortcomings, and his score increased day by day, and he was credited for his performance in the Zhenping battle. At this time, the troops were developing a surge of mass mobilization. Li Xuexiang, deputy platoon leader of a certain unit, marched at night and mobilized the masses during the day. He helped four villages carry out land reform in one day. The political department of the unit issued a special order to record his merit. Fifty percent of the people in Guo Xiaofeng's company participated in mobilizing the masses, and therefore the company was credited. The unit generally reflected that after the implementation of the Three Records, the cadres' leadership became much easier. For example, in the past, soldiers drinking cold water could not be stopped, but later it was proposed that whoever drinks cold water will have points deducted, and since then no one has drunk it. Currently, the political department of the unit has made a decision to universally launch the \"Three Records\" movement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陈谢某部实行“三记”　形成群众性的自我教育运动\n\n1948-01-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　陈谢某部实行“三记”\n  　形成群众性的自我教育运动\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十一日电】解放军某部在记功记好运动中创造了记分办法，现已成为群众性的自我教育、自我管理的运动。起初著名的王安国模范班郭小峰研究出一种经常记载功绩的“赔赚表”，把每一个同志的功绩逐日记成若干分，把错误扣去若干分，后来经过大家进一步的研究，制成了比较精细的“记分增减表”，并参酌以往的经验，开展了记分、记好、记功的“三记”运动。规定每天好的记分，不好的扣分，十分为一好，三好为一小功，三小功为一平功，三平功为一大功，三大功为一特功。这种办法不仅适应积极分子的水平，同时也适应落后分子的水平，埋没不了任何人的一点成绩。即使是落后分子，日积月累，亦可成为英雄模范。例如某团战士罗安过去表现很不好，自开展了“三记”运动后，便逐渐改正了过去的毛病，分数逐日增加，镇平战斗中就记了功。在此时期，部队正展开发动群众的热潮，某部副排长李学详黑夜行军，白天发动群众，曾在一天内帮助四个村庄进行土地改革，该部政治部特传令记功。郭小峰所在连有百分之五十的人数参加发动群众，因而记了功。该部普遍的反映，三记实行后，干部领导省事多了，例如过去战士喝冷水制止不了，后来提出谁喝冷水扣谁的分，此后就没有人喝了。现该部政治部作出决定，普遍开展“三记”运动。"

Even the reactionary Kuomintang newspapers admit that more than 90 percent of the Northeast territory (including major cities such as Harbin, Qiqihar, and Jiamusi) is under the control of the People's Liberation Army, and the Kuomintang army is squeezed into the narrow area along the Shanhaiguan, Shenyang, Changchun, and Jilin railways. Shenyang is already in a state of semi-encirclement, and the People's Liberation Army is smoothly carrying out the war to completely eliminate the Northeast. In North China, the People's Liberation Army has occupied almost the entire Shanxi. The victorious operations of the Liberation Army in Hebei have pinned down the main force of the Kuomintang in the Ping, Tianjin, and Baoding areas, unable to move. The Kuomintang army in Shandong is trapped along the coast and around the US naval base of Qingdao. The People's Liberation Army has achieved great victories in Central China, especially in the area between the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. The front line has approached major cities such as Hankou, Nanjing, and Shanghai. West of the Pinghan Railway, vast areas of Henan and Hubei provinces have been liberated and have advanced to the border of Sichuan. At present, the Kuomintang has adopted Japanese tactics, holding on to large cities, seaports, and the most important transportation lines. However, everyone knows that this tactic did not bring victory to the Japanese invaders, nor will it bring victory to the Kuomintang generals and American advisors. The People's Liberation Army has the support of the vast majority of the Chinese people, which is its strength and the source of its victory. The People's Liberation Army has excellent military cadres, high morale, and excellent combat qualities. Its operational characteristics are its courage and decisiveness in attack, its tenacity in defense, and its flexibility and initiative in mobile warfare. In the long struggle, it has developed its strategy and tactics, which are based on the principles of people's war. It has learned to inflict annihilation blows on the enemy and win brilliant victories.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中国人民解放斗争　进入决定性的转折点　苏联雅拉科夫评中国战局\n\n1948-01-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中国人民解放斗争\n  　进入决定性的转折点\n  　苏联雅拉科夫评中国战局\n    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科十九日电：雅拉科夫上校顷在真理报发表“中国战局检讨”论文称：国民党现在在一切战场上都已转入防御，而人民解放军却屡战屡胜，这标志着中国解放斗争进程的决定性的转折点。甚至国民党反动报纸也承认：东北百分之九十以上的领土（包括哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、佳木斯等大城市）在人民解放军控制下，国民党军被挤在山海关、沈阳和长春、吉林铁道沿线的狭窄地带；沈阳已处于半包围状态，人民解放军正顺利进行完全肃清东北的战争。在华北，人民解放军已占领几乎整个山西。解放军在河北的胜利作战，使国民党主力被牵制在平、津、保地区，动弹不得。山东的国民党军被困在沿海一带，及美海军基地青岛周围。人民解放军在华中，特别在黄河、长江间地区已获巨大胜利。战线已逼近汉口及南京、上海这类大城市了。在平汉路西已经解放河南、湖北两省的广大地区、且已进迫四川边境。目前，国民党已采用日本的战术，坚守大城市、海港和最重要的交通线。可是，大家知道：这种战术并没有给日寇带来胜利，也不会给国民党将军们和美国顾问们带来胜利。人民解放军获得绝大多数中国人民的支持，这就是它的力量所在和胜利的源泉。人民解放军拥有优秀的军事干部、旺盛的士气和优良的战斗素质，它的作战特点，是攻击中的果敢坚决，防御中的顽强，运动战中的灵活主动。它在长期斗争中已经发展了它的战略和战术，这种战略和战术是根据人民战争的原则而来的，它已经学会给敌人以歼灭打击和赢得辉煌胜利。"

Our reporter Yang Shuo reports: The 101st Division of the 35th Army, known as the main force of Fu Zuoyi's bandit army, was badly battered this time southeast of Laishui, and fled in terror. When the People's Liberation Army attacked the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway at the end of December, the division rushed from its old nest in Zhangjiakou to reinforce it. However, it was ambushed and flanked along the way, and was beaten into a daze. On the evening of the 11th of this month, our regiment attacked Laishui. Bandit Fu hurriedly sent Guo Jingyun, the commander of the division, with the 301st and 303rd regiments, to rescue them from Dingxing at dawn on the 12th. Just nine miles across the Juma River, they were surrounded by the People's Liberation Army in Wucun, Gaoluo and other places 20 miles southeast of Laishui. The fog was heavy that day, and at 5 p.m. we began to attack from the south, west and north. The artillery fire was fierce, and the soldiers fought bravely, beating the bandits into a state of despair. Division Commander Guo Jingyun supervised the battle in Wucun and, seeing that the situation was unsustainable, ordered the 303rd Regiment to risk their lives to retreat from Gaoluo to Wucun overnight. Before dawn, he personally led the newly withdrawn regiment across the river and fled to Bainanhouchun Village, leaving the 301st Regiment struggling desperately to cover the wounded. At this time, the puppet army Liu Hua's troops were stationed in Dingxing, although they were only ten miles away, they dared not come to the rescue. On the afternoon of the 13th, we began the general attack. The artillery fire was strong and accurate, and the enemy was beaten into a chaotic retreat. Ignoring the cold water, they rushed across the river to escape to Dingxing. At this time, some of our soldiers tracked and pursued them. Seeing that the situation was not good, the enemy turned around and ran towards Gaobeidian, but the pursuing artillery fire bloomed everywhere, forcing the enemy to flee westward again. All that could be seen was the collision of vehicles and horses, and the overturning of men and horses, creating utter chaos. Our soldiers chased back and forth, annihilating more than 600 enemies one after another, and the enemy fled back to the stronghold of Gaobeidian. The 101st Division of the 35th Army, on which Fu Zuoyi relied to make his fortune, has since suffered a great loss of vitality.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 傅匪主力元气大伤　涞水一仗一○一师被歼六百\n杨朔\n1948-01-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　傅匪主力元气大伤\n  　涞水一仗一○一师被歼六百\n    【新华社晋察冀前线廿二日电】本社记者杨朔报导：号称傅匪作义主力的三十五军一○一师这回在涞水东南被我打得头破血流，胆战心惊，四散奔逃。解放军在十二月底破击平汉北段时，该师从张家口老巢仓皇赶来增援。可是沿途遭我阻击、侧击，被打得昏头昏脑。本月十一日晚，我团攻涞水，傅匪慌忙派该师师长郭景云带着三○一和三○三两团在十二日黎明从定兴跑来援救，刚过拒马河九里地，就被解放军包围在涞水东南二十里的吴村、高洛等地。当天大雾迷蒙，下午五点我从南、西、北三面开始攻击，炮火猛烈，战士奋勇，把傅匪打得丧魂落魄，师长郭景云在吴村督战，见大势不支，连夜叫三○三团冒死从高洛撤到吴村，天色未亮就又亲自带着刚撤来的该团过河向白南侯村逃去，剩下三○一团拼命挣扎，掩护伤兵轻重。此时，伪军刘化南部驻于定兴，虽相隔十里，而不敢出救。十三日下午我开始总攻，炮兵火力旺盛准确，敌人被打得乱跑，不顾水冷，急忙过河向定兴逃命。这时，我一部战士跟踪追击，敌人见势不对，扭头又朝高碑店跑，可是追击炮火遍地开花，逼得敌人又往西窜。只见车马辎重乱碰乱撞，人仰马翻，乱成一团。我军战士往来追赶，先后歼敌六百余人，歼敌逃回高碑店据点。傅作义赖以发家的三十五军一○一师，自此已经元气大伤了。"

    "content": "[Ji-Lu-Yu News] The Ji-Lu-Yu Rear Headquarters, when holding a forum for stretcher-bearer cadres, proposed strictly reviewing financial and grain procedures to prevent embezzlement and waste. In the past, the leadership was not strict or attentive enough to the procedures for stretcher-bearer and civilian laborers' firewood and grain expenses, leading to serious embezzlement and waste. After the cadres from the Huangdian District of Dingtao who were in charge of stretcher-bearers returned to their district, they had a big meal at the Huangdian market, spending 20,000 yuan and seeking reimbursement from the headquarters. They also planned to sell and divide up more than 800 jin of millet that had been left over from the last stretcher duty. Some districts even treated the surplus provisions for stretcher-bearers and civilian laborers as a surplus of their own agency and used it to improve their living standards. The reasons for the surplus were: (1) Cadres who were detached from production received provisions along with the civilian laborers, saving the firewood and grain that they had already received from their original agency. (2) The firewood and grain rations for sick, straggling, and deserting personnel were still claimed as usual. (3) Before the date when provisions were due, they were re-claimed because they had been transferred to another agency or unit. (4) The lamp oil fees issued to stretcher-bearers and civilian laborers for marching at night were rarely used. When returning after completing their mission, the civilian laborers were eager to go home, which reduced the marching time, and the issued firewood and grain coupons were not used up. Based on the above reasons, it was decided to thoroughly review the past procedures for the stretcher-bearers' and civilian laborers' expenses, strictly implement the procedures, and conduct spot checks on the number of stretcher-bearers to eliminate embezzlement and waste.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫开担架会　严格财粮手续防止贪污浪费\n\n1948-01-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀鲁豫开担架会\n  　严格财粮手续防止贪污浪费\n    【冀鲁豫消息】冀鲁豫后方总指挥部，召开担架干部座谈会时，提出严格清理财粮手续，防止贪污浪费。过去领导上对担架民工柴粮开支手续不够严格和注意，以致发生了严重的贪污浪费现象。定陶黄店区带担架的干部回到本区后，到黄店集上大吃一顿，费洋两万元，到指挥部报销；并准备把上次担架节余的小米八百余斤卖掉瓜分。还有的区把节余的担架、民工给养当成本机关节余，改善生活。节余的原因：（一）脱离生产的干部随着民工领给养，节省了自己原机关已领的柴粮。（二）病号掉队逃亡减员之空额柴粮，照常支领。（三）未到应领日期，因转拨另一机关部队使用而重领。（四）晚上行军领的担架民工灯油费很少用着。完成任务回来时，民工归家心切，减少了行军时间，所发之柴粮票用不完。根据以上原因，确定对已往担架民工支借手续，进行彻底清理，并严格手续，抽查担架人数，以杜绝贪污和浪费。"

The school newspaper published an editorial on the 15th, pointing out: \"Grasping the spirit of Chairman Mao's report is of paramount importance in learning. To grasp the spirit, we must conduct detailed research on the content of the document to understand the position from which the question is raised, what it explains, and what are the grounds and reasons; and distinguish between their importance, major and minor aspects. After grasping the spirit, use it as a weapon to examine one's own thoughts and work, so as to further understand the spirit of the document.\" The study method adopted by each group is to discuss the center of the document section by section, while raising questions for research and discussion. At present, the atmosphere of studying problems is extremely strong throughout the school. In the discussions, heated debates often occur, even delaying meal times because of the debates. The research office and the organization department's groups are still arguing incessantly during meals.

Men, women, old, and young are all energized for winter production. Recently, due to the high price of rice, the masses saw that although they were earning a lot of money, it was effectively less when converted to rice, as the price of rice had almost doubled. Production enthusiasm was somewhat low, and they wanted to take a break. Cadres discovered this thinking and sought to boost morale by summarizing the achievements of the recent half-month of production. Of the entire village, excluding 26 households targeted for struggle, 117 poor and hired labor households and 53 middle peasant households participated in mutual aid production. In the past half-month, 15 head of livestock earned 900,000 yuan in transport, 13 people carrying loads and pushing carts earned 400,750 yuan, 31 people working in iron smelting and kilns earned 375,000 yuan, 9 people boiling saltpeter earned 135,000 yuan, 10 people working in flour mills, oil mills, and other workshops earned a total of 186,000 yuan, and 6 cotton ginners and carpenters earned 136,000 yuan. Five large and small cooperatives earned a total of 485,000 yuan. 203 women, full and part-time laborers, spun a total of 6,860 catties of cotton, earning 880,000 yuan. The total earned in the half-month was 3,490,000 yuan. 156 poor and hired men and women earned 2,935,000 yuan, averaging 18,800 yuan per person. 86 middle peasants earned 556,250 yuan, averaging 6,468 yuan per person. (Why do middle peasants benefit less than poor and hired laborers? Please answer. – Editor) After this concrete accounting, the masses saw that as long as they worked hard, the profits were still substantial. They all said: Even if rice is expensive, we must produce; the faster rice rises, the faster we earn. Branch Secretary Meng Shuzhi said: We are getting more benefits because of voluntary association and the poor being in power; in half a month, poor and hired laborers can buy seven dou of rice each.

Even within the Social Democratic Party of the imperialist lackey Schumacher, an increasing number of party members are demanding to participate in the congress. The \"Young Eagles,\" the youth organization of the Braunschweig Social Democratic Party, has decided to send representatives to the Bremen conference. The party's reactionary leading organs are attempting to use the despicable means of expelling party members to prevent their participation in the People's Congress, which has aroused the indignation of party members.

Dick, a member of the \"German Committee for Peace\" in Bavaria in the US occupation zone (a Social Democrat), also criticized: Expelling party members who participate in the People's Congress is a dictatorial method.

The so-called \"rebirth confession\" is actually a vicious conspiracy by the Yan bandits and landlords to \"borrow a knife to kill people, slaughter peasants, carry out reversals of verdicts, and conscript soldiers in disguise.\"\n\n  In response to the enemy's tricks and conspiracies, the Jiexiu Party, government, military, and civilians have launched a military and political offensive against the enemy, printing and distributing a large number of propaganda materials, coordinating with armed forces, advancing as the enemy advances, mobilizing and organizing the masses in villages along the line to unite and resolutely fight to the death with special agents and landlords to completely smash the enemy's vicious \"rebirth confession\" trick. They are also calling on and mobilizing the broad masses to come to the liberated areas to establish \"reception stations\" to be responsible for receiving and assisting refugees fleeing to the liberated areas. In forty days, they have helped 476 households, totaling 1,706 men and women, to settle down and organized them to engage in production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 反对阎贼杀人抓丁　介休军民痛击“转生会”\n\n1948-01-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　反对阎贼杀人抓丁\n  　介休军民痛击“转生会”\n    【本报消息】阎匪为了破坏我方土地改革，大施抓丁作最后挣扎。现已在介休铁路沿线各村，与特务、反动倒算地主勾结，建设屠场——“转生会”，大肆屠杀我群众。最近由太原运来敌“转生工作队”四百余，仅十二月廿九日，介休城敌人借“转生”名义，即杀死群众二百余。日来更在洪山打死农民十余名，张良打死七三则、金四儿等五人，三佳、义安二据点也打死十三名，同蒲铁路以北各村，匪更采用“联防转生自白”办法，展开屠杀，对青年壮丁除借故打死者外，大部已“集训”，强迫入伍。仅罗王庄村现已抓到青年四千余，经“转生”后准备运往太原。所谓“转生自白”实际上就是阎匪、地主“借刀杀人，屠杀农民，进行倒算，变相抓丁”的毒辣阴谋手段。\n    针对敌人鬼计、阴谋，现介休党政军民已对敌展开军事、政治攻势，印发大批宣传品，武装配合，敌进我进，动员组织沿线村群众团结起来，坚决与特务、地主进行决死斗争，彻底粉碎敌人“转生自白”的毒辣鬼计。并号召动员广大群众到解放区来，成立“招待站”，负责招待、救济逃来解放区的难民。四十天中，帮助四百七十六户男女一千七百零六口分别安了家，组织他们进行生产。"

On the early morning of December 30th, our troops ambushed the enemy's \"Self-Defense Corps\" near Dongxi Buyi Village, more than 30 li south of Pingyao. The bandits came out of Xiquan to loot grain and fell into our ambush, and we captured more than ten of them alive. That night, the Third Detachment of the Model Guerrilla Team in Jiexiu went to attack the Jiexiu Railway Station, captured three members of the bandit police station alive, and obtained a telephone. We suffered no casualties.\n【Taiyue News】The Jiexiu Independent Battalion, in coordination with the District Detachment's Rotation Team, fought a good battle. On January 14th, more than 60 men from the 6th Company of the 18th Regiment of the Bandit Security Forces in Nanwangli, divided into two groups, went to Donghulong Village to loot grain. One group entered the village from the north gate, and the other from the west gate. As soon as they entered the village, Zhang Sanhu, the commander of our 2nd Company, threw out two hand grenades, and the assault team bravely charged at the enemy. A volley of hand grenades scattered the enemy, who turned around and ran. As they fled the village, they were intercepted by our troops ambushed outside the village. After a hearty 15-minute battle, we killed four of them, wounded twelve, and captured eighteen alive, including a squad leader. We seized three machine guns, thirteen rifles, five hundred rounds of ammunition, and 700,000 yuan in legal tender. We suffered a total of three killed and wounded.\n【Taiyue News】Explosions have started in Xin'an, Western Henan, and the first shot has already been fired.

Some hired peasants did not know how to use the loans and feared they would not be able to repay them if they lost money. Additionally, due to other difficulties, they were afraid to take out loans. For example, one hired peasant in the Xiaohe Lian Village of Qin County firmly refused to take out a loan. Furthermore, some hired peasants still faced unresolved difficulties after taking out loans, making production impossible. For example, one hired peasant in Hanyang Village of Anze County had many difficulties after taking out a loan and could not find a way to engage in production. Fearing he would lose money, but also realizing that he had to pay interest even if he did not use the loan, he went up the mountain to chop firewood in order to prepare the interest payment, turning the loan into a burden. He said: \"Regardless of whether I produce or not, I have to prepare the interest for the government.\" In some places, another problem occurred: substitution and monopolization. For example, in Hong＠ Village of Anze County, after the loans were issued, the production was managed centrally by the \"lu\" (a neighborhood unit), which dissatisfied the hired peasants who said: \"We took out a loan, but we didn't even see what a Jinnan currency note looks like!\" In Xiaonanshi Village of Changzi County, some hired peasants put the loans into cooperatives, and regardless of profit or loss, they were given two \"jin\" of cotton as a dividend per ten thousand yuan per month. In Sangqu, Anze, hired peasants were centrally organized to engage in speculative production by buying and selling grain and liquor. After understanding these serious phenomena, the Prefectural Commissioner's Office has telegraphed all counties to immediately correct them.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 岳北冬季生产检查团　发现贷款没起作用\n\n1948-01-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　岳北冬季生产检查团\n  　发现贷款没起作用\n    【太岳消息】岳北专署冬季生产检查团，检查了沁源、沁县、安泽、长子等县的贷款工作，发现有些地方因为放款时官僚主义，没把贷款的意思说清楚，有些雇贫不知道怎样使用贷款，怕赔了还不起；又因为还有别的困难，就不敢贷。象沁县小河联村有个雇贫，就坚决不贷。又有些雇贫贷款后，还有困难没解决，没法生产。象安泽河阳村有个雇贫贷款后困难多，找不到生产门路，怕赔了钱，可是放着不用也得出利息，就上山砍柴，准备利钱，贷款变成了负担。他说：“生产不生产，得给公家准备上利钱。”又有些地方发生另一种毛病：代替包办。象安泽洪＠村贷款后，是以闾为单位集中经营生产，雇贫都不满意的说：“咱贷了一回款，连冀南票是个啥样都没见！”长子小南石村，有的雇贫把款入了合作社，不管赔赚，每万元每月给二斤花的红利。安泽桑曲是集中雇贫贷款搞投机生产，买卖粮食烧酒。专署了解了这些严重现象，已电令各县马上纠正。"

Middle peasant Niu Fengqi said, \"When class status was determined, I was a middle peasant. I thought middle and poor peasants were one family, and I was very happy in my heart, and my enthusiasm for production was not low. But after hearing about the Land Law Outline, my thinking changed greatly. Our land is both plentiful and good, and I agree to give up some land and property. I'm just afraid that all our family property will be confiscated and we'll be driven out the door. Wouldn't that be losing both wealth and people? So I don't want to produce.\" Cadres seized on this point and provided explanations in the civil schools, clarifying that the equal distribution of land does not harm the interests of middle peasants, thereby removing the obstacles in their thinking. At this time, poor and hired peasants Liu Chaotang, Ma Huocheng, and Suo Hushun united all the middle peasants in the village to transport goods and produce. Within fifteen days, Liu Chaotang led one poor peasant household to earn 18,000 yuan, two middle peasant households and two donkeys to earn 62,000 yuan. Ma Huocheng led six poor peasant households and one donkey to earn 16,000 yuan, twenty middle peasant households and twelve donkeys to earn 132,000 yuan. Suo Hushun led three poor peasant households and four donkeys to earn 45,000 yuan, five middle peasant households and five donkeys to earn 50,000 yuan. Under their leadership and influence, all twenty-eight poor peasant households in the village, with seven donkeys, earned 100,200 yuan, and another twenty-one laborers earned 131,000 yuan by carrying loads. Ninety middle peasant households, with one hundred and nine laborers and thirty-two donkeys, earned 248,000 yuan. (Jingyun, Chaotang, Huocheng, Chongqi)\n　　Poor and middle peasants are one family. The equal distribution of land movement does not harm the interests of middle peasants. The land of some middle peasants will not change, and some can even be allocated land and floating wealth. Only a portion of wealthy middle peasants will contribute some surplus land, which will be done through consultation, and their burden will also be reduced after contributing this land. With the overthrow of landlords, the large stone slab is also removed from the heads of middle peasants, who can then produce well and build their families with peace of mind. Some middle peasants are now panicking, either due to rumors spread by landlords or due to misunderstandings of the Land Law. We should patiently explain and dispel their concerns. It is good that the poor and hired peasants of Qiushuyuan are uniting with middle peasants in production. Only when poor and hired peasants truly grasp the Land Law and conduct mass persuasion and education among middle peasants can we achieve the effect of stabilizing and uniting middle peasants.\n　　　　　　——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 打破对土地法的怀疑　秋树垣中农安心生产\n\n1948-01-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　打破对土地法的怀疑\n  　秋树垣中农安心生产\n    【黎城消息】黎城三区秋树垣村有些中农听到土地法大纲后，因为不很了解，发生了恐慌。中农牛逢奇说：“在划阶级时我是中农，我想中贫农是一家，在思想上很高兴，生产劲头也不少。可是听到土地法大纲，我思想上起了很大的变化。咱的土地又多又好，拿出部分土地和财产，我很同意。就是怕把咱的家产都没收了，赶出门，这不是入财两丢？所以不想生产了”。干部抓住这点，就在民校教育解释，说明平分土地是不妨碍中农利益的，才把他们思想上的障碍清除了。这时贫雇刘朝堂、马火成、索虎顺等就团结着全村的中农，运输生产，十五天内，刘朝堂领导贫农一户赚洋一万八千元，中农两户、驴两头赚洋六万二千元。马火成领导贫农六户、驴一头赚洋一万六千元，中农二十户驴十二头赚洋十三万二千元。索虎顺领导贫农三户驴四头赚洋四万五千元，中农五户驴五头赚洋五万元。在他们领导影响下，全村贫农二十八户、驴七头赚洋十万零二千元，另有二十一个劳力担挑赚洋十三万一千元。中农九十户、劳力一百零九个、驴三十二头，赚洋二十四万八千元。（景云、朝堂、火成、崇奇）\n    贫中农是一家人。平分土地运动并不损害中农利益。一部分中农的土地不变动，一部分还可分到土地和浮财，只有一部分富裕中农拿出一些多余土地，还是商量着办，而且拿出这些土地以后，负担也减轻了。打倒地主，中农头上也去掉了大石板，以后更可好好生产，安心发家。现在有些中农发生恐慌，或者由于地主造谣，或者由于误解了土地法。应该向他们耐心解释打破顾虑。秋树垣贫雇团结中农生产是很好的，也只有贫雇真正掌握了土地法，向中农进行群众性的说服教育，才能收到稳定中农，团结中农的效果。　　　　　　——编者"

The instructions stated: (1) The People's Tribunal should be a tool for the people to suppress counter-revolutionaries and all elements endangering the people's interests, and an organizational form that takes the form of mass meeting trials and executions of criminals to the next level. During the current land reform period, the People's Tribunal should protect the peasants and resolutely punish all criminals who violate or undermine the Land Law and infringe upon the democratic rights of the people, according to the demands and opinions of the people.

At the same time, the prosecution, trial, and judgment of the People's Tribunal must be realistic, distinguish right from wrong, and any hasty, reckless, emotional, and subjective actions are wrong. (2) In order to make itself an effective revolutionary weapon in the hands of the people, the People's Tribunal must follow the mass line in its work. It must go to the masses to collect the facts and evidence of the defendant's crimes, as well as the masses' demands for the defendant's punishment, conduct investigations and research, verify the evidence, and listen to the defendant's defense. After clarifying the facts, a judgment should be made. The judgment should be announced after being discussed by the masses.

The People's Tribunal should have a principled distinction between the conviction of landlords and rich peasants and the conviction of workers and peasants; the former should be severely punished, and the latter should be leniently punished. (3) Regarding the organization of the People's Tribunal, there is currently no experience. We propose that the county establish a People's Tribunal, handle cases by district, conduct circuit trials, or hold trials in villages. In short, it should be convenient for the masses and meet the requirements of the masses' revolutionary struggle, and there should be no bureaucracy. Each county may appoint five, six, seven, or eight judges (depending on the number of districts) from the county government. Each district will then elect two to four judges from the peasant representative conference (or elected by the district peasant association and approved by the district peasant representative conference), and organize the county People's Tribunal Trial Committee by district (which may be prefixed with the order of the district), and mutually elect a chief judge in each district to preside over the trial, hold meetings, and accumulate experience. Judges should be selected from those who have a firm stance, are not afraid of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, are careful and steady in their work, and are supported by the masses. The county party and government leaders must strengthen their leadership over the People's Tribunal, and the judgment of important criminals must be approved by the county head before execution. Criminals sentenced to death must be executed only after the county head's approval. However, if the criminal is not satisfied with the judgment of the county People's Tribunal, he may request a retrial and may appeal to the commissioner's office. All those who have filed an appeal must wait for the final judgment of the commissioner's office before they can be executed according to law. (4) The work of the People's Tribunal can be roughly divided into the following four steps: (A) Inspection work: Inspectors elected by peasant organizations or inspectors appointed by the government should convene mass accusation meetings in the village where the defendant committed the crime, collect the facts of the defendant's crime and witnesses and physical evidence, and conduct investigations and verification, organize and draft the indictment, and demand punishment of the defendant on behalf of the injured people. This indictment must be reviewed, revised, and passed by the peasant masses before being submitted to the People's Tribunal and orally prosecuted at the court hearing. This step is the most important. A well-written indictment can concentrate the demands of the masses, encourage the emotions of the masses, raise the awareness of the masses, and make it impossible for the criminal to quibble in the face of sufficient and reliable witnesses and physical evidence. (B) Trial work: After receiving the indictment, the People's Tribunal should promptly conduct a preliminary hearing. After all preparations are completed, the date and location of the hearing should be determined, notices should be issued, and the public can freely attend the hearing. With the permission of the judges, the attendees can also speak. The judges shall interrogate the defendant based on the indictment, examine the witnesses and physical evidence, and allow the defendant himself or the defendant's representative to defend himself and present rebuttal evidence. The judges shall study the accusations and defenses and evidence presented by the plaintiff and the defendant, and then determine whether the charges are established. If the evidence is insufficient to constitute a crime, more investigations should be conducted among the masses to collect materials, clarify the facts, and try again next time or declare innocence. This step is to clarify the facts and ensure the truth of the charges. The judges should be realistic, calm, and not afraid to trouble themselves to distinguish right from wrong. (C) Judgment work: After the second step is completed, the trial committee should be convened to formulate the judgment. Before the sentencing, it is necessary to consult with the relevant masses to solicit their opinions. If the masses have any questions, they should be explained to them clearly. If the masses raise objections and have new materials, if the opinions of the masses are correct, they should be accepted, and the court should be reopened for trial, and the committee will revise the original judgment. If the opinions of the masses are incorrect, they should also be explained to them well until they are explained clearly and the masses agree, and then the court should be opened for sentencing. This step is the work from the proposed judgment to the sentencing. It is very important to solicit the consent of the masses and explain to the masses at this time. This can make the work of the People's Tribunal meet the requirements of the masses, and can also educate the masses and raise the awareness of the masses. (D) Execution work: After the sentencing, the judgment should be executed. The fines should be executed by the People's Tribunal and handed over to the village peasant organizations for handling. Those who are sentenced to imprisonment for two or three years or less can generally be handed over to the village for forced labor, but do not give the criminals physical abuse. Criminals sentenced to more than two or three years of imprisonment can generally be handed over to the county prisons (or renamed labor reformatories) to perform forced labor. The prisons run by the administrative offices can also transfer some prisoners for centralized management and use (repairing rivers and roads, etc.). The management and work of the prisons should be rectified and improved, and experience should be accumulated. The death penalty should be carried out by shooting, executed by the People's Tribunal. We believe that it is better to hand over most of the prisoners sentenced to imprisonment to the village for execution, which can adjust the labor force of the masses and reduce the government's management difficulties. (5) The People's Tribunal is absolutely not allowed to use torture to extract confessions or engage in malpractice. The organs and corresponding people's representative conferences that appoint or elect judges may reward, punish, adjust, or replace them at any time according to the work situation of each judge. If there are serious circumstances of favoritism, malpractice, and dereliction of duty, they should be handed over to the People's Tribunal for trial. During the land reform period, village peasant organizations may arrest current offenders who violate the Land Law, but they must promptly report to the People's Tribunal and hand them over to the People's Tribunal for handling, and they must not be detained for a long time. (6) Regarding the work of the People's Tribunal, there is still a lack of experience, so we must let the People's Tribunal do it boldly, create experience, and accumulate experience. We hope that all localities will report their experience in this regard to us at any time.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋察冀边区行政委员会　公布人民法庭工作指示　镇压反革命及危害人民利益分子把群众大会审判的方式提高一步\n\n1948-01-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋察冀边区行政委员会\n  　公布人民法庭工作指示\n  　镇压反革命及危害人民利益分子把群众大会审判的方式提高一步\n    【新华社晋察冀二十一日电】晋察冀边区行政委员会于六日颁发“关于人民法庭工作的指示”，并通知各级政府依据是项指示，于已开始进行土地改革的县份迅速成立县人民法庭。指示称：（一）人民法庭应该是人民镇压反革命及一切危害人民利益分子的工具，是把群众大会审判处决罪犯的形式提高一步的组织形式。在目前土地改革期间，人民法庭应该保卫农民，对于一切违抗或破坏土地法及侵犯人民民主权利的罪犯，必须根据人民群众的要求和意见，坚决予以处分，任何对于这些罪犯的纵容和自由主义都是错误的。同时，人民法庭的起诉、审讯与判决，必须实事求是，明辨是非，任何草率鲁莽及感情用事和主观主义都是错误的。（二）人民法庭为要使自己成为人民手中有效的革命武器，必须遵照群众路线去进行工作，必须到群众中去搜集被告的犯罪事实与证据，及群众对被告处分的要求，加以调查研究，对证及被告的声辩，把事实弄明确后，再行判决。判决经群众讨论后，再行宣布。同时，办事必须迅速，方能适合群众的要求和情绪。人民法庭对于地主、富农罪犯的判罪与工农罪犯的判罪应有原则的区别，前者应从重，后者应从轻。（三）关于人民法庭的组织，目前尚无经验，我们提议县设人民法庭，分区办事，巡回审判或到村就审。总之，要便利群众，要适合群众革命斗争的要求，而不要有任何官僚主义。各县可由县政府委派审判员五、六人或七、八人（按区之多少），各区再由农民代表会各选派（或由区农会选派，区农民代表会批准）审判员二至四人，分区组织县人民法庭审判委员会（可冠以区之次序），并在各区互选主任审判员一人，主持审判、开会，并蓄积经验。审判员应选择立场坚定，不怕镇压反革命，办事细心稳当，并为群众拥护者充任。县党、政负责人必须加强对人民法庭的领导，重要罪犯的判决须经县长批准然后执行，判决死刑之罪犯，必须经县长批准才能执行。但罪犯如对县人民法庭之判决不服可要求复审，并可向专员公署提出声辩，凡已提出声辩者必须等候专员公署最后判决，才能依法执行。（四）人民法庭的工作大体可分为以下四个步骤：（甲）检察工作：由农民团体推选之检察员，或由政府委派的检查员到被告犯罪所在村召开群众控诉会，搜集被告犯罪事实及证人、证物，并加以调查、对证，整理起草控诉书，代表受损害人民要求对被告人处刑。此项控诉书须经农民群众审查、修改通过后，然后递交人民法庭，并在开庭时口头起诉。这一步骤最关重要，起诉书作得好的，可以集中群众要求，鼓励群众情绪，提高群众觉悟，并在充分而确实的人证、物证之前使罪犯无法狡辩。（乙）审讯工作：人民法庭在接到控诉书后，应迅速进行预审。一切准备好了之后，即决定开庭日期、地点，发出通知，开庭时人民可自由旁听，经审判员的允许，旁听人并得发言。审判员根据起诉书审讯被告，审查人证、物证，并允许被告自己或被告的代表辩护，和提出反证。审判员根据原告、被告提出之控诉与辩护及证据加以研究，然后确定罪状是否成立。如证据不足不能构成犯罪者，要再到群众中去调查，搜集材料，弄明事实，下次再审或宣告无罪。这一步骤就是弄清事实，确实罪状的工作，审判人员要实事求是，头脑冷静，不怕麻烦的辨明是非。（丙）判决工作：第二步工作做好后，即召开审判委员会，拟定判决。宣判之前，要先与有关群众商量，征求群众意见，群众如有疑问，应向群众很好的解释清楚，群众如提出反对意见，并有新的材料，如群众的意见是正确的，就应接受群众意见，再开庭审判，委员会将原判加以修改。如果群众的意见不正确，也要很好的向群众解释，直至解释清楚，群众同意后，再开庭宣判。这一步就是从拟判到宣判的工作，在这时征求群众同意，并向群众解释是很重要的，这样可以使人民法庭的工作符合群众的要求，并可教育群众，提高群众的觉悟。（丁）执行工作：宣判之后，要按判决执行，罚款由人民法庭执行，交村农民团体处理。判二年或三年以下徒刑之人犯，一般可以交村罚劳役，但不要给罪犯以肉体上的虐待。判决超过二年或三年徒刑的人犯，一般可交县监所（或改称劳动感化院）执行强迫劳动，各行署所办之监所并可调一些犯人集中管理使用（修河修路等）。监所的管理和工作应加整顿和改善，并蓄积经验。死刑一律用枪决，由人民法庭执行。判决徒刑的人犯我们考虑大部交村执行要好，这样可以调剂群众的劳动力，并可以减少政府管理上的困难。（五）人民法庭绝对不准刑讯，不准舞弊。委派或选派审判人员之机关及相当的人民代表会，得按各审判人员之工作情形随时奖惩、调换。如有营私舞弊，违法失职情节重大者，应交付人民法庭审判。村农民团体在土地改革期间，对于违犯土地法之现行犯，得进行拘捕，但必须迅速报告人民法庭，并交人民法庭处理，不得长久关押。（六）关于人民法庭的工作，现在还缺乏经验，因此要放手让人民法庭去做，创造经验，蓄积经验，望各地随时把这方面的经验报告我们。"

However, during an inspection in December last year, it was discovered that the poor and hired peasants had not thoroughly turned over, and feudalism had not been overthrown. Fifteen households of poor and hired peasants still live in extreme poverty: the 63-year-old poor peasant Tian Weishi only has 2.2 mu of hillside land, and last autumn harvested 5.2 dou of corn, of which 4 dou was to be paid to the mutual aid team as wages. She cried for a whole day before negotiating with the mutual aid team to spin four jin of cotton to offset the wages. She has nothing at home. She said, \"When dividing the fruits of labor, I wanted a water tank, but the cadre said: You are dying soon, what do you need that for! So they took it back.\" The poor peasant Ren Dushi and her two daughters still live in a small kiln without a door, which is cold when the door is open during the day and dark when it is closed; at night, they have no lamp or fire and have to go to the neighbor's house to make a living. The impoverished Zhang Tianshi only received a small kiln and 10,000 yuan in the struggle. She is already 63 years old and cannot spin much more cotton. Her life is very difficult. They can only eat two meals of corn grits a day. Wang Bao's wife is still wearing thin clothes. On the other hand, the landlords and rich peasants actually still control the village politics, and the lives of six rich peasant households are still the same as before. There are a total of 14 people detached from production in the village cooperative, of which the objects of struggle account for seven, and one of them even served as a puppet Bao chief for eight years. They serve as managers, runners, and other main cadres, eat at the cooperative (eating white flour every day), use things from the cooperative, do not pay labor, and still receive a monthly salary. Two hundred and eighty households joined the cooperative with a total share capital of 4,693,000 yuan, but only six poor peasant households joined, with a share capital of only 27,000 yuan. Such a cooperative certainly cannot serve the poor and hired peasants. Those with connections can borrow the cooperative's ox carts, but the poor cannot borrow them. Therefore, the poor and hired peasants reflected, \"The cooperative belongs to those who are objects of struggle.\" (Zhipeng, Qifu)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 盆窑地主掌握村政　贫雇现在还穿着单衣\n志鹏　起富\n1948-01-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　盆窑地主掌握村政\n  　贫雇现在还穿着单衣\n    【沁阳消息】二区盆窑村有三百五十户，一向被认为是群运先进村。但在去年十二月检查时，发现了贫雇翻身很不透，封建更没有打垮。贫雇农里有十五户还过着十分穷困的生活：六十三岁的贫农田魏氏只有坡地二亩二分，去年秋天打了玉茭五斗二升，要给互助组出四斗工资；哭了一天，才和互助组商议好纺四斤花顶替工资。家里什么也没有。她说：“分果实时我想要个水缸，干部说：你快死了，要那干啥！就给顶回来了。”贫农任杜氏母女三人，还住着一个没风门的小窑，白天开门冷、关门黑；黑夜里没灯没火，只得凑到邻家作生活。赤贫张田氏斗争中只分了一孔小窑和一万元钱，她已六十三岁，花都不能多纺了，生活十分困难。她们每天只能吃两顿玉茭圪糁。王保的女人到现在还穿着单衣。在另一方面，地主富农实际上还掌握着村政，有六户富农的生活还和从前一样。村合作社里共有十四个脱离生产人员，其中斗争对象占了七人，有一人还当过八年伪保长。他们当的是经理、跑外等主要干部，吃在社里（每天吃白面），用在社里，不支差，每月还拿薪水。二百八十户在合作社里入了股，股金共计四百六十九万三千元，里面只有六户贫农，股金才二万七千元。这样的合作社当然不能替贫雇办事，社里牛车有法的可以借，穷人就借不出。所以贫雇反映说：“合作社就是人家斗争对象们的”。（志鹏、起富）"

Who establishes military bases on the five continents of the world? Who interferes in the internal affairs of other countries, and says that the people of other countries are the protected? Who is conducting or secretly encouraging the war in Greece, the war in Indonesia, the war in China, the war in the Near East? Who is sending cannons, warships, instructors and supervisors to China and Turkey, to Iran and Greece now? Who despises the beauty of Naples, the cigars of Manila, the radio stations of Algiers, the slums of Shanghai, the islands of the Azores, the oil of Iran, the deposits of Nepal? Who openly interferes in the internal affairs of other countries, and says that he \"cannot tolerate communists\"? Who hypocritically criticizes the elections of democratic countries, such as Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, but deprives millions of so-called \"colored\" citizens of the right to vote in his own country? Who, in order to save Tsaldaris (Prime Minister of Greece - translator), curses Jefferson (drafting the American Declaration of Independence), in order to help Salazar (Prime Minister of Portugal - translator) cites the Atlantic Charter, and in order to support Franco, praises the genius of Cervantes? Who has gathered all the executioners, all the surrenderers, all the model officials in his own country—today they work in cannon factories, and tomorrow they will become cannon fodder? They repeatedly talk about these \"migratory figures,\" these new \"crusaders.\" Wouldn't it be better to say migratory fascism?\n    When they want to seize certain countries, they are not limited by distance. The \"Monroe Doctrine\" is against Europeans interfering in the affairs of Americans, but after deciding to send military experts to the Dardanelles and the Aegean coast, the American imperialists calmly said: this—is—a \"development of the Monroe Doctrine.\" They want to prohibit Europeans from interfering in European affairs. Maybe they will say that the Acropolis is on the banks of Missouri (an American state)? If the Genoese discovered America in 1492, why can't the Chicagoans \"discover\" Attica in 1947?…\n    Not long ago, General de Gaulle made a speech against the French Republic. The godfather across the sea is not too picky, and the impression of the godson is not bad. When General de Gaulle represented the French nation in 1942, the Americans thought he was better than Admiral Darlan, who carried the flavor of Vichy (the seat of the pro-German puppet government during the anti-German war). Now that de Gaulle represents the French reactionaries, Bryte (the American bastard who desperately advocated supporting Chiang Kai-shek) also welcomes him.\n    Using lofty words to cover up base deeds\n    American thugs like to use lofty words to cover up base deeds. When they pour fuel oil on black people and burn them in Mississippi or Georgia, a group of murderers blow their horns, another group pray, and the third group silently recites \"the victory of justice,\" and the daughter of the majestic race theorist, who doesn't skimp on a gallon of gasoline in this matter, sings sentimental romances. After the atomic bomb was tested on Bikini Island, American hypocrites spent a lot of money to build a monument to the killed goats. Yes, these gentlemen have bombs in one pocket and Easter eggs in the other. They have said so many touching words, and are now saying \"aid to the democracy of Greece and Turkey,\" this honey is disgusting even to Walter Lippmann, who is used to seeing everything. He wrote: \"America's strength—is on the ocean and in the sky. If we want to compete with the Red Army, we should have bases not too far from the important centers of the Soviet Union: the only strategic passage is from the Black Sea to Ukraine and the Caucasus. The eastern Mediterranean, the Aegean Sea and the Dardanelles Strait—the gateway to the Black Sea... should no longer burden itself with interpretations that have nothing in common with the nature and the resolutions passed. No one can force us to 'aid'. There is no need to say 'democracy', because everyone understands that the current Greek government is the most pathetic model of 'democracy', and Turkey, she has a very 'respected' government, but cannot be called democratic. The White House and the State Department believe that the strategic initiative of the American people has not yet matured, and they believe that the proper solution should be to add oil, add water, and add sugar in order to reassure the people. In my opinion, they made this mistake.\"\n    Let them know\n    Don't all these gentlemen understand that we were able to stand still in the face of Hitler's army, and will we tremble after listening to a dozen scary speeches and hundreds of suffocating essays? I know how little the average American knows about everything that is happening now and has happened in the past outside the borders of the United States. Let them respect the march of the pioneers of fascism in 1919 against the young Soviet Republic. Our country was weak and unarmed at the time, and the powers advancing towards us were dizzy with military victories. Let the average American know that we were weak and unarmed in Odessa, Arkhangelsk, and Vladivostok, and we expelled the invaders, although we were not able to punish them for the suffering of our people. Industrialists still believe that the anti-Soviet people's war is an unprofitable enterprise, and they will get sores instead of dividends. A quarter of a century has passed. The mad German corporal (Hitler), on the one hand, made his people stupid, and on the other hand, massively reenacted the ambitions of the interventionists. Let the average American recall how this ended: we not only expelled the invaders, but we also punished them. The fascists who fantasized about imposing their order on us first got the \"Warrior's Cross\" on their necks, and then an ordinary rope. Let the average American look at the scorched \"Cross recipients\" and think about the crosses on German graves. The people of Stalingrad cannot be intimidated.\n    We are not isolated\n    We shed a lot of blood in the struggle for freedom. We exchanged victory for our own blood, saved ourselves and saved the world. Not long ago, the American Major General Deane published a book, he was the head of the American military mission in Moscow. The book is entitled \"The Strange Alliance\". Yes, now this strange general feels that the fighting alliance of the two peoples is \"strange.\" When we stood on the Volga River, when we drove the Germans from the Volga to the Dnieper River, when the Americans and British were enjoying the peace given to them by the fighting of the Red Army, it took us two years to sew the last button on the new uniform. At that time, General Deane felt that the fighting alliance between the Soviet Union and the United States was very natural. What is \"strange\" to him is that we won—this was beyond his expectations.\n    Why did he lose his mental balance, eloquence and common sense? There is a well-known poem by Tyutchev:\n    Winter is not angry in vain,\n    It's time for her to leave—\n    Spring knocks on the window,\n    Sweeping in the courtyard.\n    The evil witch (referring to winter) is crazy,\n    Before leaving, grabbed a pile of snow,\n    Thrown at that beautiful child…\n    Spring's suffering will pass easily,\n    She washed in the snow,\n    No matter how fierce the enemy is,\n    The complexion is even more ruddy.\n    I will explain immediately: it is impossible to wash in the articles of \"The New York Times\", \"Daily Telegraph\" or \"Time\" (American reactionary newspapers and periodicals). However, the witch that Tyutchev saw was written very truthfully, the reason why the witch is crazy is because it is time for her to leave.\n    We are not alone, with us, there are the people of all Europe. They know how much blood the Russians shed in the struggle against the hateful fascists. I said in the book \"The Road to Europe\" that the Red Army helped liberate Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. This angered Mr. Gerwise, who sent a reproach in the \"New York Times\": \"I did not find a description of hundreds of millions of gold yuan, about the Lend-Lease Act...\" How to explain to these half-merchant and half-official people that there is no income and expenditure ledger that has one page recording rivers of blood and another page recording hundreds of millions of gold yuan. There are hundreds of cities in Europe that now have \"Stalingrad Street\", and I have never seen a \"Lend-Lease Act Street\" anywhere...\n    We are not alone: with us, there are the people of the whole world. The Americans who oppose us, they also oppose the American people. The British who oppose us, they also oppose the British people. The French who oppose us, they also oppose the French people. With us, there are all the people, because we are defending peace. We have shown that we can fight in the years of war; but this does not mean that we like war. We firmly believe that mothers give birth to sons, not for \"crusades\", people build houses, not for bombs, and people won the terrible anti-fascist war, not to allow migratory fascism to plan another more terrible war a few years later.\n    Mr. Lippmann studies to what extent Americans have grown up and to what extent they have not grown up. The political vision of the average American is limited. The average American has not yet grown up enough to understand how Mr. Lippmann and other \"strategic\" enthusiasts fool them three times a day. However, the average American has grown up to the point of understanding common sense. That is why the American imperialists are trying to \"add oil, add water, and add sugar\" to their own inhumane ideas. That is why the American people, according to Mr. Lippmann, are \"stable.\" Mr. Ayer once openly admitted: \"An attack on the Soviet Union is impossible now because the American people are too naive.\" Yes, the American people are still very naive, so they believe the lies spread to them under the guise of objective news about the imaginary \"Red imperialism.\" Yes, the American people are still very naive, so they didn't send Mr. Ayer from the government to the asylum. However, the average American is not so naive to die for the dividends of crazy oil tycoons, arms dealers and other atomic merchants. The American people have brains, conscience, and humanity. They are now worried about the future, worried about the coming crisis, the greed of entrepreneurs, the rise in prices, and the rise of reactionary forces. They are not great politicians, but the average American is a living person. They want to live, to work, and to have fun. It is impossible to drive them back to military transport ships.\n    The winter of mankind will not return\n    Even if there is still a slight chill and bad weather ahead—the winter of mankind will not return. The city of London endured the terrible bombing winter and now lives through a dark, hungry, and poor winter after victory, not to return to the shameful days of \"gentlemen's agreements,\" \"non-interference policies,\" and Chamberlain and the like. The British people have experienced a lot, and they will not be willing to join the new \"crusade\" to be a poor drummer. British miners, metallurgists, and workers will not give speeches in Fulton. They cannot be responsible for those solo performances or harmonious duets. Who forces the people to forget the dark days of the occupation of France. The deaths of anti-enemy heroes, border guards and guerrillas, is it so that Paul, Reynaud or other gravediggers of France can translate the words of Wall Street into French \"ATOUT (play) him\"?\n    Did the suffering and fighting of the people of Yugoslavia, Poland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Albania is for the purpose of allowing the displaced kings, generals, and gendarmes to migrate back to them, is it so that autonomous countries become the Philippines of Europe and Greece where Americans replace the British as supervisors?\n    Ten years ago, I greeted May Day in Spain. The Spanish people bravely repelled the power of the fascists. Germany and Italy once supported the executioner Franco. Now there is a change here: Britain and the United States are supporting the executioner Franco. However, the Spanish people's war for their own freedom is continuing, and the people will win in this war.\n    Only great poets can write the tragedy of the Greek people. This people once fought heroically against the fascist invaders. But after they won, they were deprived of their freedom, and were sent \"good nannies\" with good machine guns. Every day, Greek patriots are suffering and going to the execution ground, just like in the years of German occupation. However, the Greek people's war for their own freedom is continuing, and the people will win in this war.\n(Dalian \"Truth News\")\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 自然法则\n爱伦堡\n1948-01-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　自然法则\n    爱伦堡\n  　是谁呢？\n    几百家美国报纸，英国保守党的几家机关报，一些被外国人收买去的法国报纸，他们每天写着：“俄国人——这是帝国主义者”，“苏联渴想扩张”，“莫斯科威胁和平”。一个老法子：贼跑走的时候高叫“捉贼！”是谁把手枪摆在桌上而讲和平？是谁在世界的五大洲建立军事基地？是谁干涉别国的内政，并且说别国人民为被保护者？是谁在进行或者秘密鼓励希腊的战争、印度尼西亚的战争、中国的战争，近东的战争？现在派往中国和土耳其，派往伊朗和希腊的是谁的大炮，谁的兵船，谁的教官和监督人？谁蔑视拿波里的美丽，马尼刺的雪茄，阿尔及耳的无线电台，上海贫民窟，阿左尔的岛屿，伊朗的石油，尼泊尔的蕴藏？谁公开干涉别国的内政，而说他“不能容纳共产主义者”？谁伪善地非难民主国家的选举，如南斯拉夫和保加利亚，而在自己家里却剥夺了千百万所谓“有色”公民的投票权？谁为了拯救蔡尔达里斯（希腊总理——译者），而咀咒杰斐逊（美国独立宣言起草人），为了帮助萨拉柴（葡萄牙总理——译者）而引用大西洋宪章，以及为了支持佛朗哥，而称赞塞万提斯的天才？谁在自己家里征集了所有的绞刑吏，所有的投降者，所有的典刑官——他们今天在大炮工厂工作，明天他们就将成为炮灰？他们屡屡谈起这些“迁移人物”，这些新的“十字军人”。说是迁移的法西斯主义，不是更好吗？\n    渴望夺取某些国家的时候，他们是不受距离的限制的。“门罗主义”是反对欧洲人干涉美洲人的事，在决定派遣军事专家到鞑靼尼尔和爱琴海岸上去之后，美帝国主义者非常冷静地说：这——是——“门罗主义的发展”。他们想禁止欧洲人干预欧洲的事。也许他们会说，阿克罗波尔是在米苏里（美国的一个州）岸上的吧？如果热拿亚人在一四九二年发现了美洲，为什么芝加哥人在一九四七年不能“发现”阿蒂卡呢？……\n    不久前，戴高乐将军曾经发表演说反对法兰西共和国。海那边的干爸爸并不过分挑剔，干儿子的印象也不坏。当一九四二年戴高乐将军代表法兰西国家的时候，美国人认为他比带着维希（抗德战争时期法奸伪政府所在地）水味的海军上将达尔朗好些。现在戴高乐代表着法兰西的反动派，布里特（就是竭力主张援蒋的那个美国坏蛋）也欢迎他。\n    说高等的话遮下等的事\n    美国的匪徒们，喜欢以高等的话来遮掩下等的事。当他们在密西西比州或乔治亚州用燃料油浇在黑人身上烧的时候，一批凶手吹起号角，另一批作着祈祷，第三批暗诵着“正义的胜利”，而在这件事情上不怜惜一加仑汽油的威严的人种论者的女儿，在唱感伤的罗曼斯曲。原子弹在比基尼岛试验之后，美国的伪君子们，为给炸死的山羊修建纪念碑而化去了大量的钱。是的，这些先生们的一个口袋里是炸弹，另一个口袋里是复活节的小鸡蛋。他们曾经说了这末多动人的话，并且现在也在说“援助希腊和土耳其的民主”，这种蜜糖，甚至连一切都看惯的瓦尔特·李普曼先生也恶心了。他写道：“美国的力量——是在海洋上和天空中。如果要与红军较量，我们就应当有不能离苏联重要中心过远的基地：唯一的战略通道，是由黑海到乌克兰及高加索。地中海东部、爱琴海和鞑靼尼尔海峡——这个黑海的门户……不应当再使自己负担那在本质上和通过的决议没有丝毫共同点的解释。谁也不能强迫我们‘援助’。不需要说‘民主’，因为大家都明白，现在的希腊政府，是‘民主’的最可怜的典型，而土耳其，她有一个十分受人‘尊敬’的政府，但不能称为民主的。白宫和国务院认为美国人民的战略主动尚未成熟，他们认为正当解决，应该是加油，加水，加糖，为的是使人民安心。照我的意见，他们就犯了这个错误。”\n    让他们知道\n    难道所有这些先生们都不了解，我们既能在希特勒军队面前屹立不动，我们会听了十来篇吓人的演说和成百篇窒息人的小文章而战抖吗？我知道，普通的美国人，对于美国国境以外现在发生的和过去已经发生过的一切，知道得多么少。让他们去尊敬一九一九年法西斯主义先驱者们对年青苏维埃共和国的行军吧。我们的国家，当时是衰弱而又无武装，而向着我们前进的列强们，给军事上的胜利冲昏了头脑。让普通的美国人知道奥德萨、阿尔汗格尔斯克、海参崴的我们当时是衰弱又无武装的，我们驱逐了侵略者，虽然我们没有能因为我们人民的受难而惩罚他们。实业界人士们还是相信，反苏维埃人民的战争，是不上算的企业，他们会得到代替红利的疡伤。四分之一世纪过去了。疯狂的德国上等兵（希特勒），一方面使自己的人民变得愚卤，一方面大规模地重演干涉者的野心。让普通美国人回忆这是怎样结束的：我们不仅驱逐了侵略者，我们也惩罚了他们。幻想在我们这里推行他们秩序的法西斯主义者，最初在劲子上得到了“勇士十字”章，而后来就是一根平常的绳子。让普通美国人看看烧焦的“十字章领得者”，想想德国坟墓上的十字架。斯大林格勒的人民是恫吓不了的。\n    我们不是孤立的\n    我们在为自由的斗争中，流了许多血。我们以自己的血，换来了胜利，救了自己和救了世界。不久之前，美国出版了狄那少将的一本书，他曾任美国驻莫斯科军事代表团的团长。这书题名为“奇异的盟邦”。是的，现在这位奇异的将军觉得两种人民的战斗同盟是“奇异的”。当我们屹立在伏尔加河上的时候，当我们把德国人从伏尔加驱逐到德伯河的时候，当美国人和英国人一起在享受红军的战斗所给与他们的太平的时候，两年的时光，我们才把最后的钮扣钉上了新的制服。那时候，狄那将军觉得苏联和美国的战斗同盟是十分自然的。他“奇异”的是我们胜利了，——这是出乎他意料之外的。\n    为什么他失去了心灵的平衡、通辑和常识呢？有一首众人皆知的邱特切夫的诗：\n    冬天不是徒然凶恶，\n    是她临去的时光了——\n    春天敲着窗子，\n    在庭院里扫荡。\n    凶恶的巫婆（指冬天）痴狂了，\n    临走时抓起一堆雪，\n    投向那美丽的孩子……\n    春天的苦难很容易过去，\n    她在雪里洗了一洗，\n    不管敌人怎样凶猛，\n    脸色反而更红润了。\n    我马上要解释：在“纽约时报”，“每日电讯报”或“时代”（美国反动派的报纸和刊物）的文章里是无法洗的。然而邱特切夫所看到的巫婆却写得非常真实，巫婆之所以痴狂，因为是她临去的时光了。\n    我们不是孤独的，同我们一起，有全欧洲人民。他们知道，在反抗可恶的法西斯主义者的斗争中，俄国人流了多少血。我在“欧洲之路”这本书里曾经说到，红军帮助解放了南斯拉夫和保加利亚。这就触怒了杰尔维斯先生，他在“纽约时报”中投来责备说：“我没有找到关于千百万金元，关于租借法案的叙述……”如何对这些半商半官的人解释，没有一本收支流水帐簿上是一页记着成渠的血液，而另一页上记着千百万金元的。欧洲有几百个城市里现在有“斯大林格勒街”，无论什么地方我都没有看见“租借法案街”……\n    我们不是孤独的：同我们一起，有全世界的人民。反对我们的美国人，他们也反对美国人民。反对我们的英国人，他们也反对英国人民。反对我们的法国人，他们也反对法国人民。同我们一起，有一切的人民，因为我们是在保卫和平。我们在战争的年代中表现出我们能战；但这并不就是说我们喜欢战争。我们坚强地相信，母亲生儿子，不是为了“十字军”，人们造房子，不是为了炸弹，人民赢得可怕的反法西斯战争，不是为了使迁移的法西斯主义在过了几年之后再计划一次更可怕的大战。\n    李普曼先生研究美国人已经成长到什么程度和没有成长到什么程度。普通美国人的政治眼光是有限的。普通美国人还没有成长到足以懂得李普曼先生和其他的“战略”爱好家们怎样每天愚弄他们三次。然而普通美国人已经成长到懂得常识的程度。这就是为什么美帝国主义者们竭力“加油加水加糖”到他们自己毫无人性的思想中去。这就是为什么美国人民，照李普曼先生的话，是“安定的”。艾尔先生曾经公开承认：“进攻苏联现在不可能，因为美国人民过于天真了。”是的，美国人民还很天真，所以他们相信那些在客观消息外貌之下对他们散播关于假想出来的“赤色帝国主义”的谎言。是的，美国人民还很天真，所以他们没有把艾尔先生从政府里送进疯人院。然而，要他们去为疯狂的石油商、军火商和其余的原子商人的红利送死，普通美国人就不这样天真了。美国人民有头脑、有良心、有人性。他们现在担心着未来，担心着行将来临的危机、企业家们的贪婪、物价的高涨和反动势力的高涨。他们不是什么了不起的政治家，但是普通美国人是活的人。他们要活，要工作，要娱乐。要将他们赶回军用运输舰上去是不可能的了。\n    人类的冬天不会回来\n    即使前面还有微寒和坏天气——人类的冬天不会回来的。伦敦城忍受惨酷轰炸的冬天和现在在胜利以后还过着阴暗、饥饿、贫穷的冬天，并不是为了要回到“绅士协定”、“不干涉政策”和张伯伦之流的可耻日子里。英国人民经历了许多，他们不会愿意参加新“十字军”去作一名可怜的吹鼓手。英国的矿工、冶金工人、职工都不会在富尔敦发表演说。无论对那些独唱表演或是谐和二重奏，他们都不能负责。谁迫使人民忘记占领法兰西年代的黑暗日子。抗敌英雄们，边防军和游击队之死，难道是为了让保罗、莱诺或别的法兰西的掘墓人把华尔街的话翻译为法国话“ＡＴＯＵＴ（打）他”吗？\n    南斯拉夫、波兰、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、阿尔巴尼亚的人民的受苦和作战　，难道是为了让迁移的国王、将军和宪兵迁移回他们那里去，难道是为了自主的国家变成欧洲的菲律宾和由美国人取代英国人的监督者地位的希腊吗？\n    十年前，我在西班牙迎接五一节。西班牙人民勇敢地打退了法西斯主义者的政权。德国和意大利曾经支持刽子手佛朗哥。现在这里又有了改变：英国和美国支持着刽子手佛朗哥。然而，西班牙人民为自己的自由而作的战争正在继续中，在这战争中胜利的将是人民。\n    只有伟大的诗人才能够写出希腊人民的悲剧。这人民曾英勇地对法西斯侵略者抗争过。但当他们胜利之后，他们却被夺去了自由，而给他们派了带着好机关枪的“好保姆”。每一天，希腊的爱国者在受苦难，在走向刑场，好象在德国占领的年代一样。然而，希腊人民为自己的自由的战争正在继续中，在这战争中胜利的将是人民。　　　　　　　　\n　　　　　　　　　（大连“实话报”）"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-24",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "【Wu'an News】The Wu'an County Government convened a meeting of financial and grain assistants on the 19th to inspect the labor levy situation in various districts. It was discovered that in many places, the banner of \"taking care of the poor and hired laborers\" was used, but in reality, it harmed them:\n　　I. Cadres pay less in labor levies but receive more labor grain: When Dongshang Village in the Second District settled labor levy accounts in the tenth day of the eleventh lunar month, the village secretary's labor contribution was very small according to his labor power, only amounting to 112.3 jin of rice. However, the labor account recorded many workdays for him, entitling him to 447 jin of rice, so he made a net profit of more than 335 jin. Village chiefs, anti-requisition cadres, and financial and grain cadres all received between 200 and 300 jin of rice. Where did these workdays come from? The political director of Quanshang Village said, \"We record workdays when we attend meetings outside, and we also evaluate seven extra workdays each month.\" Political directors, village chiefs, and peasant association chairmen in Boyan Village, Third District, received an extra ten workdays in addition to their regular monthly workdays. Therefore, they didn't actually contribute labor but received rice every month. The county government's labor levy regulations stipulate that cadres who eat their own food while attending meetings outside are credited with one workday, and those who eat at the village or public expense are credited with half a workday. However, most villages recorded full workdays. Some even submitted separate expense accounts after recording full workdays. For example, the financial expenditure of Shangquan Village included an item for cadres' meeting rice conversion of 18,900 yuan and vegetable expenses of 70,000 yuan.\n　　II. Because cadres contribute less labor and record more workdays, the poor and hired laborers actually contribute more labor, but their recorded workdays are less than those of the cadres, so they have to pay labor levy rice. What if they can't afford it? Use the fruits of struggle to \"take care of\" the poor and hired laborers, and then ask them to use it as labor levy rice, to be given to the cadres who \"should get\" labor levy rice \"according to workdays.\" When Xujiapo in the Fourth District settled labor levy accounts, they said that the poor and hired laborers could not afford the labor levy rice, so they took 1,200 jin of millet and 600 jin of wheat from the fruits of struggle and gave it to the poor and hired laborers, and then asked them to turn it over as labor levy rice. Nanan Yao Village had a similar situation, taking 200,000 yuan and 800 jin of millet from the fruits of struggle to \"take care of the poor and hired laborers,\" but in reality, it just passed through their hands and all went to take care of the cadres.\n　　III. In villages like Nanbei Qiaohe, Yangtun, and Shishimen in the Fourth District, labor levy accounts were not settled in the first half of the year, and later it was proposed to \"wipe it all out\" (meaning invalid), so everyone didn't want to take anything out and settled it perfunctorily. Who suffered the loss when we investigated? It was the poor and hired laborers who suffered the loss, because if these villages really settled the accounts, the poor and hired laborers could get some labor levy rice. Zhao Dian and Dongpo villages never settled their accounts throughout the year, remaining confused until the end. In Zhuangshang Village in the Ninth District, accounts were settled every half year, and the poor and hired laborers over-contributed the most labor, over-contributing a total of more than 90 workdays, but it took six months before these over-contributed portions were returned in rice, and the difficulties at home could not be resolved in time.\n　　IV. In Datun Village in the Fourth District, \"sharp heads don't contribute labor levies.\" Who are the \"sharp heads\"? Naturally, they are those \"pompous\" cadres and those who have relationships with them. Where there are sharp heads, there are silent heads. The poor and hired laborers have not been emancipated and dare not speak, so they can only be silent heads, and the labor levies are all pressed on them. (Wang Qingyu, Ru Xiu)\n　　Editor's Note: It is a fact that village cadres have difficulties in paying labor levies, and it should be handled in accordance with regulations; however, the various phenomena mentioned above are incorrect. We feel that not only the poor and hired laborers suffer losses in each village, but also the middle peasants, who are not much better off than the poor and hired laborers, also suffer losses. This inspection in Wu'an is good; but it should be pointed out that the leadership should also conduct a deep self-examination of these erroneous phenomena and formulate more comprehensive labor levy methods based on the opinions of the people.\n　　【Shahe News】In Dalian Town, Sixth District of Shahe, labor levies were assigned according to labor power for grain transportation, and the poor and hired laborers suffered great losses. The five main cadres in the North Street of the town raise four mules and two donkeys. The two grain transportation tasks assigned to his street were 20,000 jin. Village cadres stipulated that livestock would not contribute to labor levies, and the task was apportioned among all the male laborers in the street, with each person contributing 80 jin. The two tasks totaled 160 jin. Each share was calculated at 5,000 yuan for freight (six days), and livestock were hired to pull. The entire street contributed a total of eight large carts. Zhao Baozhu, the director of the peasant association, who raises one mule and one donkey himself, contributed one cart alone, pulling 17 shares; in addition to his own share, he earned freight for 16 shares, earning a net profit of 55,000 yuan after deducting expenses for livestock and people. The cadres contributed a total of five carts, pulling 75 shares. The remaining 50 shares were all pulled by the cooperative and the middle peasants' large carts (three carts). The poor and hired laborers only had to pay freight. After the deputy village chief returned, he asked Zhao Man for 5,000 yuan in freight, but he couldn't afford it, and he was forced to pay, and even his rice vat was taken away.

Upon hearing the news, District Chief Li led the militia of Sanhuang＠, bravely charging to Tianmayu to fire a volley, pushing part of the enemy back to the mountaintop. At this time, Wang Ziqi, the militia captain of Nanhuang＠, and Li Zhiying, the militia captain of Zhonghuang＠, led the militia, dividing into routes, charging to the northwest mountain and the east mountain, which were very close to the enemy, and finally repelled the enemy, wounding two.

More than 20 people went to Wanghongmiao and Nanshanfeng in the Seventh District of Changqing, and were repelled by our militia members Zhang Qi'an, Wang Huaichen, and Jia Xuren.

Our comrades Song Zhaoming, Liu Daoling, and Cha Kehuan went to the top of the big mountain and engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy, repelling the enemy's three charges under the cover of machine guns. The three persisted until dark, driving the enemy back. On the same day, our Work Team killed four grain-robbing enemies from the Changqing pseudo-county brigade in Song Village, Third District, and seized four rifles and eleven overcoats.

    "content": "Military Academy Taiwan Team Students Celebrate First Anniversary of New Life\n    [Our Newspaper] The Military Academy Taiwan Team solemnly celebrated its first anniversary of new life on the 11th, holding a grand meeting at its station.\n    As the meeting began, over a hundred Taiwanese soldiers sang the \"Taiwan Youth Song,\" followed by an opening speech by Instructor Lin. He first explained that the Taiwan Team was formed on January 9th of last year, composed of 138 individuals from the 139th and 140th Brigades, among whom 101 had already fought in the People's Liberation Army. He then pointed out their three greatest advancements over the past year:\n    1.  In the past, they were unclear about their own class, searching for a \"motherland\" everywhere, not knowing for whom they were working. Now, after studying the history of Sino-Japanese-Taiwanese relations, investigating class backgrounds, and engaging in land reform studies, especially after the speak bitterness meetings, they calculated the accounts of exploitation by imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek's comprador capitalists, and landlords, deeply recognizing themselves (component statistics: proletariat accounted for 57 percent, petty bourgeoisie 26 percent, those from worker-peasant backgrounds totaled 92 percent). They realized how severely they had been exploited and oppressed by landlords and imperialists. Among 118 individuals, 223 siblings had been forced into prostitution, and 115 parents and siblings had been starved to death in the hands of landlords and big capitalists. Now, they have clarified their direction, knowing that the Chinese Communist Party truly represents the interests of the Chinese people; they found their true motherland after arriving in the liberated areas and realized that they themselves are the masters of Taiwan.\n    2.  Culturally, before coming to the school, 86 people could not write compositions, 34 were illiterate, and only 18 could write compositions. Now, 87 people can write compositions, and 42 can read and write. After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, most are able to copy it down.\n    3.  After liberation, 18 people performed meritorious deeds at the front, one special-class combat hero, and five others were commended.\n    Such great achievements were attained due to the increased class consciousness and the resolution of the unity problem between the Gaoshan ethnic group and the Han ethnicity (a portion of the students are from Taiwan's minority Gaoshan ethnic group).\n    He also pointed out that they have rectified their ranks, united as one, and carried out the struggle against Lin and Li Agu, purging the internal bad elements; and they must continue to deeply resolve ideological problems.\n    During the free speeches, many comrades eagerly spoke, recalling their past suffering of the past year and their progress, unanimously shouting, \"We must bravely advance under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao! Whoever oppressed us in the past, whoever deceived us, we will overthrow them!\"\n    Finally, Vice-Principal Zhou and Director Li instructed everyone: \"You should further improve on the existing foundation, study revolutionary skills well, especially study the Outline Land Law, so that you can return early, mobilize the workers and peasants of Taiwan to unite all the people, and establish a new Taiwan.\" Before the adjournment, the Taiwan Team Workers and Peasants Committee representative also read out a telegram thanking Chairman Mao. In the evening, they performed two plays they had composed themselves using Taiwanese tunes, \"Motherland Mao Zedong,\" and the Gaoshan ethnic group performed \"One Year's Progress.\" (Lü Zhen)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 军大台湾队学员庆祝新生一周年\n吕真\n1948-01-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　军大台湾队学员庆祝新生一周年\n    【本报讯】十一日，军大台湾队隆重庆祝新生一周年，在驻地开了一个大会。\n    大会开始，一百多台湾战士高唱“台湾青年歌”，接着林指导员致开会词。他首先说明了台湾队是去年一月九日由一三九旅、一四○旅一百三十八人组成的，其中有一百零一人已参加人民解放军打过仗。然后指出一年来他们三点最大的进步：\n    一、过去对自己的阶级弄不清楚，到处“找祖国”，不知道为谁来干。现在经过学习中、日、台关系史，查阶级、土改学习，特别是诉苦大会后，算过帝国主义、蒋介石买办资本家和地主的剥削帐，深刻认识了自己（成份统计：无产阶级占百分之五十七，小资产百分之二十六，出身工农的共百分之九十二），知道自己受地主、帝国主义的剥削压迫是怎样的厉害。在一百一十八个人中，就有二百二十三个兄弟姊妹被逼迫出卖，一百一十五个父母兄弟姊妹被逼饿死在地主、大资本家手里。现在认清了方向，知道中国共产党才是真正代表中国人民利益的；到解放区以后才找到了真正的祖国，也觉悟到了自己就是台湾的主人。\n    二、文化上，未到校前有不会作文的八十六人，不认字的三十四人，会作文的只十八人。现在会作文的已经有了八十七人，会认会写的四十二人，土地法大纲颁布后，多数都能够抄下一份来。\n    三、解放过来后，在前方立了功的有十八人，一个特等战斗英雄，记好的有五个人。\n    由于提高了阶级觉悟，解决了高山民族与汉族的团结问题（有一部分同学是台湾少数民族高山民族人），才获得了这样大的成绩。\n    并指出他们已经整顿了自己的队伍，团结一致，进行了反林和李阿古的斗争，清除了内部的坏蛋；并要继续深入的解决思想问题。\n    自由讲话中，许多同志争前恐后发言，回忆自己一年来前的痛苦和一年的进步，同声欢呼：“要在共产党毛主席领导下勇敢前进！过去谁压迫了我们，谁欺骗了我们，我们就打倒谁！”\n    最后周副校长、李主任指示大家：“应在现有基础上更加提高一步，好好学习革命本领，特别是研究好土地法大纲，以便早日打回去，发动台湾工农团结全体人民，建立新台湾。”在休会前，台湾队工农委员会代表并宣读感谢毛主席的电文。晚间演出了他们自己用台湾曲调编成的“祖国毛泽东”和高山族编演的“一年来的进步”两个剧。（吕真）"

    "content": "[Anyang News] Landlord Sang Peilu and others in Nanleikou, Anyang, infiltrated the Communist Party branch, seized leadership, evaded struggle, shielded landlords, oppressed poor peasants, hired laborers, and middle peasants, and forced a poor peasant village head to death. Their crimes are enormous. The Anyang County Committee has disbanded this branch.\n\nThe Nanleikou branch was established in the 30th year of the Republic of China [1941]. It once had fourteen party members. Among them were two landlords, two bankrupt rich peasants, one middle peasant, seven poor peasants, and two hired laborers. The landlords had the greatest power, and some poor peasant party members followed them. When the branch was first established, it led the masses in settling accounts for the embezzlement of four bao chiefs, and the struggle was not bad. Li Tingshu was the most active among the party members (he was a bankrupt rich peasant, who had become a poor peasant at that time), and he served as the chairman of the Farmers' Association. When the landlords in the village saw that the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army had come to mobilize the poor to turn over, they all tried to mortgage their land and \"become\" middle peasants. In March of the 31st year of the Republic of China [1942], Sang Peilu, the village's number one landlord, returned from the stubborn army, pretended to be active, and infiltrated the militia. In December, he was introduced by Chen Zhiyu and sneaked into the Party. The leadership of the branch was slowly taken over by him.\n\nSang Peilu first step was to defeat Li Tingshu. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China [1943], he used the psychology of the masses' demand to fight locusts, saying that Li Tingshu was late in fighting locusts. He undermined Li Tingshu's prestige among the masses. Later, he said that Li Tingshu had distributed too much relief grain and was a lazy man and a thief... This is how Li Tingshu was angered to death. The \"branch decided\" that Sang Peilu would be the chairman of the Farmers' Association, and Sang Peilu's lackey, Sang Sihe, would be the village head. This bad guy further took over the power of the entire village of Nanleikou.\n\nLi Tingshu's son, Li Tongzhi, was also a party member. Sang Peilu was afraid that Li Tongzhi would take revenge, so his second step was to attack him. He said that he was promiscuous and paraded him through the streets with a tall hat. Later, Li Tongzhi's wife died, and Sang Peilu took the opportunity to buy him off with four thousand yuan, and Li Tongzhi also became Sang Peilu's henchman.\n\nSang Peilu and his younger brother, Sang Peiting, anticipated that the struggle was about to come upon them, and tried to stir up trouble in the village and frame activists. They let Li Tongzhi attack the poor peasant activist Zhang Yunbao. They also promoted Zhang Yunbao to be the Farmers' Association's storekeeper. After a few days, rumors spread that the Farmers' Association had lost one hundred and fifty pearls, a twelve-foot red satin, and a pair of gold pendants... They tied up and beat Zhang Yunbao, saying that he had taken them. They used this method to stop the movement in the village. Last spring, during the great land reform movement, the village head Sang Sihe said: \"Our village has been thoroughly reformed long ago. Let anyone who says it hasn't been thoroughly reformed come here!\" Seeing this situation initially, the leadership transferred Sang Sihe and Li Tongzhi to work in other villages, and also dismissed some bad party members from their administrative work, and promoted a group of new cadres from top to bottom. Although the movement was launched, because the poor peasants and hired laborers were not truly mobilized, these new cadres had no support and therefore had no power. Those bad party members who had been dismissed from their jobs were not convinced and always wanted to overthrow these new poor peasant cadres and regain power. When the branch held a meeting to overthrow the village head Zhang Gouzhi (a poor peasant youth), the non-party member bully rich peasant Sang Zhenghe also went to participate and came up with many bad ideas. A few party members were still a little timid about this illegal action, fearing that the higher authorities would not allow the change if they knew about it. Sang Zhenghe said: \"If the district office doesn't allow the change, can't we learn from Quanmen and use the masses to demand it from the district? We must change him!\" When distributing the fruits of the struggle, they said that Zhang Yunbao had worked as a servant in the stubborn government and was a \"special agent,\" and wanted to beat him to death. Seeing that things were not good, the village head Zhang Gouzhi ran to Beileikou to find the district work officer. These bad guys took the opportunity to spread rumors: \"The village head ran away with the special agent.\" \"Tell him to come back and confess.\" The village head and district cadre Yang Jinyu returned to the village. The landlords and rich peasants incited the militia to shout and yell, threatening the district cadre to act according to their wishes. Yang Jinyu did not stand firm, did not firmly support the poor peasants and hired laborers, and only said that he did not understand the situation and left. Under the pressure of the landlords and rich peasants, Zhang Gouzhi could not think straight for a while, and was forced to commit suicide by taking poison. The bully rich peasant Sang Zhenghe even said: \"You drank an ounce of red cup, who are you trying to scare by drinking a pound!\"\n\nThese landlords and rich peasants suppressed the poor peasants and hired laborers, and became even more reckless. Last spring, when struggling against the landlord Sang Peiting, several members of the branch returned the fruits of the struggle to him in their original form. When distributing the fruits of the struggle, a mule was left behind. The bad party members proposed to value the mule at twelve thousand yuan and sell it to the landlord Sang Peiting. The poor peasant masses said: \"We struggled against him for a donkey, and then gave him a mule!\" Last year, in the first month, when the landlord had not been thoroughly struggled against, the branch said that the landlords had nothing to eat or drink, and distributed five dou of grain to each of them. The landlord Sang Peihe struggled out four shi, and then returned eight shi to him. Sang Peilu said: \"The people in Quanmen treat the landlords with one shi per person, and five dou is also fine here.\" They even lent the four shi of bonus grain for mass transportation to the landlord. Last summer, when they said they were going to struggle against Sang Peilu's uncle, Sang Zhengrui, they let Sang Zhengrui go the day before the meeting. Rumors spread in the village that Sang Zhengrui had been eaten by wolves. Not long after, he swaggered back. The poor peasants and hired laborers reflected: \"Sang Zhengrui was eaten by wolves, and then pooped out by wolves.\" These bad guys were so bold that they did anything bad. Li Tongzhi openly undermined conscription, saying to Erhei: \"Don't be afraid, if you don't want to join the army, then don't. As long as we are united, can the district arrest all of us?\" They ate 1,800 jin of grain that the Liberation Army X unit had stored in the village; they even forced the middle peasant Sang Yinglin to return three mu of the six mu of land that had been mortgaged to the landlord when filling in the gaps.\n\nThese bad guys dared to do such outrageous evil deeds so openly, and their relationship with certain comrades in the county and district is inseparable. The masses reflected: \"Their roots are in the political office!\" Last summer, Sang Sihe and others went to the political office several times to find Comrade ×××, reporting that the hired peasant Zhang Yunbao was a \"Kuomintang,\" and the branch could not be in charge, and asked the higher authorities to support them. Every time they returned to the village from the county, they used deception and intimidation to suppress the masses' movement to turn over.\n\nThe true face of this group of landlords and rich peasants has been completely exposed in the recent movement to mobilize hired peasants to be masters of their own affairs. The Anyang County Committee has decided to disband this branch and is preparing to punish these criminals.

    "content": "Landlords' Harsh Exploitation and Chiang-American Oppression\n　　Sharp Decline in Agricultural Production in the Chiang Area\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd】Agricultural production in the Chiang-controlled areas plummeted in the past year. According to Chiang Kai-shek's spokesman, Dong Xian Guang, before the new year: the average wheat harvest in the entire Chiang area in 1947 was about 60%, with an estimated output of 21.5 million metric tons; the rice harvest was about 67%, with an estimated output of 48 million metric tons. According to estimates by \"UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration\" and Chiang Kai-shek's Executive Yuan: agricultural production in 1946 decreased by about 8% to 12% compared with normal pre-war years; 1945 also decreased by only 17% compared with pre-war years; while in 1947, agricultural production in the Chiang area decreased by 33% to 40%. A Shanghai magazine in its December issue, when discussing the reasons for the decline in agricultural production in the Chiang area, pointed out: First, this is because under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, feudal relations of production have restricted the productive forces; less than 10% of landlords and rich peasants occupy 70% to 80% of the land in the entire Chiang area, while 90% of the peasants occupy only 20% to 30% of the land. The harsh exploitation by landlords and rich peasants forces the vast majority of peasants to be unable to continue farming or to leave the land. Second, it is also due to the (American) imperialism invading China and forming an alliance with the Chinese reactionary forces (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang), intensifying the oppression of peasants in the Chiang area, thus increasing the burden on peasants in the Chiang area. The magazine stated that the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries have no power to solve the current food crisis in the Chiang area, saying: \"The final solution to the (Chiang area) food problem depends on realizing the independent development of the national economy and on changing the existing relations of production to realize land reform where tillers own their land.\"\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd】According to Shanghai newspaper reports: The budgeted grain requisition amount of the Chiang bandits this year has increased greatly compared with last year. Last year, the Chiang bandits extorted 69.97 million *shi dan* of grain from the people under the names of \"grain requisition\" and \"grain borrowing,\" while from August 1947 to July 1948, they plan to extract 80 million *shi dan* of grain. Moreover, the Chiang bandits' Ministry of Food announced at the beginning of last month that they would forcibly \"add to the purchase\" of 3 million large packages of \"military rice\" (equivalent to about 10 million *shi dan* of paddy rice) in Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei provinces at low prices; combined with the previous amount, it totals as many as 90 million *shi dan*.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 地主苛刻剥削蒋美压榨　蒋区农业生产大减\n\n1948-01-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　地主苛刻剥削蒋美压榨\n  　蒋区农业生产大减\n    【新华社陕北二十三日电】过去一年蒋管区农业生产激降。据蒋匪发言人董显光年前供称：一九四七年全蒋区平均小麦收成约为六成，估计产量为二千一百五十万公吨；稻谷收成约为六成七，估计产量为四千八百万公吨。另据“联总”及蒋匪行总估计：一九四六年农业生产较战前正常年份约减少百分之八至百分之十二；一九四五年亦仅较战前减少百分之十七；而一九四七年蒋区农产竟减少百分之三十三至百分之四十。上海某杂志十二月号在论及蒋区农产减低之原因时指出：第一、这是由于在蒋介石统治下，封建的生产关系，束缚了生产力；不到百分之十的地主富农，占有全蒋区百分之七十至八十的土地，而百分和九十的农民仅占有百分之二十至三十的土地，地主富农的苛刻剥削，迫使广大农民不能继续维持耕作或离开土地。第二、还由于（美）帝国主义侵入中国，并与中国反动势力（按指蒋介石匪帮）结为一体，加紧压榨蒋区农民，因而加重了蒋区农民的负担。该杂志表示蒋介石反动派没有力量解决当前蒋区的粮食危机称：“（蒋区）粮食问题之最后解决，有赖于实现民族经济的独立发展，有赖于改变现存的生产关系，实现耕者有其田的土地改革”。\n    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据沪报消息：本年度蒋匪征粮预算数额较去年大增。去年度蒋匪以“征实”、“征借”等名目向人民勒榨粮食六千九百九十七万市担，而一九四七年八月至一九四八年七月则预定榨取粮食八千万市担。且蒋匪粮食部又于上月初宣布：在四川、湖南及湖北三省用低价强迫“加购”“军米”三百万大包（约合稻谷一千万市担）；连前合计共达九千万市担之多。"

    "title": "How to Implement the Poor and Hired Peasant Line in Loans",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-25",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "The General Bank's winter loan instructions last December emphasized that \"all new loans this winter must be guaranteed to be given to poor and hired peasants.\" According to our understanding, various regions have created considerable experience in loan work regarding \"how to follow the poor and hired peasant line,\" but some deviations have also occurred. We now raise a few issues for everyone's attention:\n\n(1) How to find poor and hired peasants and get the loans into their hands?\n\nThere are two ways to find poor and hired peasants. One is to personally visit the \"poorest people\" first and then rely on them to connect with other poor and hired peasants. Because \"poor people and poor people are kindred spirits,\" only poor and hired peasants can find other poor and hired peasants. This method is correct. The other is to rely on village cadres to introduce poor and hired peasants, but since most village cadres are middle or rich peasant in composition, most of those they introduce are not genuinely poor and hired peasants. As a result, the cadre line is followed, which should be corrected. Of course, village cadres who are from poor and hired peasant backgrounds and support them can also introduce poor and hired peasants.\n\nIn order to prevent non-poor peasant elements from infiltrating, we must adopt the method of \"evaluating poverty and comparing poverty\" to conduct a self-examination by the poor and hired peasants themselves to ensure the purity of the poor and hired peasant ranks. Then, elect a poor and hired peasant loan committee to divide into groups and rely on the poor and hired peasants themselves to evaluate and distribute the loans based on each person's difficulties and production situation. It is right for us to mobilize the poor and hired peasants and support them, but we must oppose the phenomenon of county, district, and village cadres taking over and doing everything for them. We must adhere to the principle of \"the masses liberating themselves.\" Only when the poor and hired peasants themselves control the power of evaluation and distribution can the loans be completely given to the poor and hired peasants.\n\nIn the process of mobilizing the poor and hired peasants, it is necessary to repeatedly and patiently explain the poor and hired peasant loan policy to them so that they fully understand it and to inspire their awareness of \"being the masters of their own affairs.\" Only in this way can we overcome the phenomenon in some places where poor and hired peasants are afraid of village cadres and dare not boldly take charge. For example, in Gaojiazhuang, She County, when poor and hired peasants evaluated loans, they first left a share for the village cadres. This phenomenon must be corrected.\n\nIn loan work, our attitude towards village cadres should be handled correctly. Some of them are good and willing to implement the loan policy and are genuinely supported by the poor and hired peasants. Other bad cadres, because they do not benefit from issuing loans to poor and hired peasants and are even required to withdraw their loans during re-lending, secretly sabotage and obstruct the loan work. In order to reduce obstacles to loan work, it is necessary to convene village cadre meetings to convey the loan policy and practices, but it is necessary to strictly criticize the past practice of village cadres occupying too many loans as wrong. In this way, on the one hand, we can unite and educate good village cadres and strive for their help in the smooth progress of this work (but not mainly rely on them), and on the other hand, isolate bad village cadres and put pressure on them so that they dare not engage in sabotage activities. In short, our attitude towards village cadres is the principle of \"uniting the good and isolating the bad.\"\n\n(2) How to eliminate the ideological concerns of poor and hired peasants regarding loans?\n\nMost poor and hired peasants have not completely turned themselves around and need loans to help them solve production difficulties. However, some poor and hired peasants are afraid to take out loans. Some say, \"The public funds are complicated in procedures. You have to repay whenever they want it.\" Others say, \"We can't find a way to produce. What's the use of taking out a loan?\" Why do the masses have these concerns? On the one hand, it is due to the shortcomings of our past loans, such as restrictions on use and inconvenient procedures, which must be corrected in this loan. On the other hand, we have not helped the poor and hired peasants to specifically calculate accounts and formulate production plans, nor have we found ways to produce. For example, Wang Fuyin of Qiaocun, Qin County, had been a farmhand for three generations and had not turned himself around. This time, when he was about to be given a loan, he worried for two days and was unwilling to take out the loan. After we interviewed him, we realized that the reason he dared not take out the loan was that he was old and could not find a way to produce. Therefore, we organized him to produce together in a mutual aid group, which dispelled his concerns. This proves that we must not only provide loans to poor and hired peasants, but also help them find ways to produce and formulate production plans.\n\n(3) The issue of uniting with middle peasants\n\nAttention should be paid to two principles when issuing loans: (1) The demands of the poor and hired peasants must be met as much as possible (because the loans are small, they may not be fully satisfied). This is the basic task of the loan. (2) We must resolutely unite with the middle peasants and avoid the phenomenon of opposition between the middle peasants and the poor and hired peasants. How to unite? First, there should be some distinction in the attitude towards middle peasants and landlords and rich peasants when transferring and recovering old loans. Loans to landlords and rich peasants should be resolutely recovered immediately. Loans over-occupied by cooperatives should also be resolutely recovered. Certain truly difficult middle peasants can be taken care of as long as they are evaluated by poor and hired peasants. In Xingtai City, the list of loan households was announced to the masses for discussion, allowing the poor and hired peasants to discuss which households should be recovered immediately and which households could be postponed. This method can be adopted. Second, political education should be conducted among the middle peasants, emphasizing that \"middle peasants and poor peasants are one family\" and \"middle peasants can get loans in the future if they don't get loans for the time being.\" Organize poor and hired peasants and middle peasants to cooperate and help each other in production. The Taiyue District proposed the practice of \"middle peasants contributing idle funds and poor peasants contributing loans to engage in production together,\" which is generally correct. We must understand that if we are not good at uniting with the middle peasants during the transfer of loans, causing the poor and hired peasants to be isolated in the countryside, it will be detrimental to all work.\n\n(4) Style of work\n\nTo implement the poor and hired peasant line, it is first necessary to go deep among the poor and hired peasants and understand them. How can we closely approach the poor and hired peasants and understand their thoughts, emotions, difficulties, and demands? First of all, we must have the spirit of being friends with the poor and hired peasants and being good farmhands for them. We must recognize that the feelings and demands of the poor and hired peasants are completely consistent with the spirit of our policies. They wholeheartedly support all the policies of the Communist Party. As long as we are willing to put down the \"official airs,\" discuss matters with the poor and hired peasants, proactively visit their homes to learn about their concerns, understand their difficulties and how they have turned themselves around, and tell them about various policies, they will tell us their innermost thoughts. In the past, some cadres often stayed in cooperatives or cadres' homes when they went to the countryside, making the poor and hired peasants think that \"cadres eat well, but poor people don't.\" We must resolutely overcome this upper-level line style of only approaching cadres and not approaching the masses.\n\nIn addition, in mobilizing the poor and hired peasants, we should also inspire their class consciousness and enthusiasm. Educate them to think from the perspective of class interests and develop a democratic style of discussing matters with everyone after they have become the masters of their own affairs. Prevent a few active poor and hired peasants from spreading some bad habits of \"taking care of everything.\"\n\nThe above issues must be clearly resolved ideologically and in work in order to implement the poor and hired peasant line in loan work and do a good job in loan work. (General Bank of Jinnan)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 怎样贯彻贷款中的贫雇路线\n\n1948-01-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　怎样贯彻贷款中的贫雇路线\n    去年十二月总行冬贷指示，着重指出：“今冬新增贷款必须保证全部贷给贫雇农手中”。现据我们的了解，各地在贷款工作中，对于“如何走贫雇路线”已创造了不少经验，但也发生一些偏向，现在提出几个问题，希望大家注意：\n    （一）怎样找到贫雇，把款贷到贫雇手中？\n    找贫雇的方法有两种，一种是我们首先亲自去访问“最穷的人”，然后依靠他们去串通贫雇。因为“穷人和穷人同是知心人”，只有贫雇才能找到贫雇，这一种方法是正确的。另一种是依靠村干部介绍贫雇，但由于村干部大部分是中、富农成份，所以他介绍的大部分不是真正贫雇，因之走了干部路线，应当纠正。当然是贫雇出身为贫雇拥护的村干部，我们也可以经过他们介绍贫雇的。\n    为了防止非贫雇分子混入，我们必须采取“评穷比穷”的办法，进行贫雇自己的审查，做到贫雇阵营的纯洁，然后选举贫雇贷款委员会划分小组，根据每个人的困难和生产情形，依靠贫雇自己去评议和分配贷款。我们为了发动贫雇，给贫雇撑腰是对的，但要反对县区村干部的包办代替现象，我们必须遵守“群众自己解放自己”的原则，只有贫雇自己掌握了评议和分配的大权，才能把款完全贷到贫雇手里。\n    在发动贫雇的过程中，要反复的耐心的给他们讲贫雇贷款政策，使他们完全了解，并启发贫雇“掌权当主人”的自觉性。只有这样才能克服某些地方贫雇怕村干部，不敢大胆起来当家作主的现象。如涉县高家庄贫雇评议贷款的时候，首先给村干部留下一份，这种现象必须纠正。\n    在贷款工作中，我们对村干部的态度，应当正确处理。他们中间有些是好的，愿意执行贷款政策，真正为贫雇所拥护。另一些坏的干部，由于发放贫雇贷款，他们得不到好处，在转贷时还要他们退出贷款，于是他们暗中破坏捣乱，阻挠贷款工作进行。我们为了减少贷款工作的阻碍，召开村干部会议传达贷款的政策和作法是必要的，但必须严格批评过去村干部多占贷款是错误的。这样一方面团结和教育好的村干部，争取他们来帮助这个工作的顺利进行（但主要不是依靠他们），另一方面孤立坏的村干部，给他们一种压力，使他们不敢进行破坏活动。总之我们对村干部的态度，是“团结好的，孤立坏的”的原则。\n    （二）怎样解除贫雇贷款的思想顾虑？\n    大部分贫雇没翻透身，需要贷款帮助他们解决生产困难，但是有些贫雇存在着不敢贷款的思想，有的说：“公家的款，手续麻烦，啥时要啥时就得还”，有的说：“咱找不见生产门路，贷款干啥用？”群众为什么会有这些顾虑呢？一方面是由于我们过去贷款，限制用途、手续不便利等缺点所造成的，在这次贷款中，一定要纠正。另一方面没有帮助贫雇具体算帐和订出生产计划，找生产门路。如沁县乔村王福印三辈当长工，没有翻透身，这次要贷给他款，他知道后发愁两天，不愿贷款。经我们进行访问，才知道他不敢贷款的原因，是年老了找不着生产门路，于是便把他组织在互助组一道生产，才解除了他的顾虑。由此证明我们不但要贷款给贫雇，还要帮助贫雇找生产门路，订生产计划。\n    （三）团结中农问题\n    发放贷款要注意两个原则：（一）必须尽可能满足贫雇要求（因贷款少，恐怕不能充分满足），这是贷款的基本任务。（二）必须坚决团结中农，避免发生中农和贫雇对立的现象。怎样团结呢？第一在转收旧贷时，对中农和地主富农的态度，应当有所区别。地主富农贷款要马上坚决收回，对合作社多占贷款，也要坚决收回，对某些真正困难的中农，只要通过贫雇评议，可对他照顾。邢台市在转贷中，把贷款户名单向群众公布，让贫雇讨论，那些户要立即收回，那些户可以缓期，这种办法是可以采用的。第二向中农进行政治教育，强调提出：“中农贫农是一家人”，“中农暂时不贷款将来可以贷款的”。组织贫雇和中农合作互助进行生产，太岳区提出：“中农拿游资，贫农拿贷款，合伙搞生产”的做法，一般是正确的。我们必须明白，在转贷时不能善于团结中农，造成贫雇在农村的孤立，对一切工作，都是不利的。\n    （四）作风问题\n    为贯彻贫雇路线，首先要深入贫雇、了解贫雇。怎样才能和贫雇亲密接近，了解他们的思想、情绪、困难、要求呢？首先要有和贫雇做朋友当贫雇好长工的精神，我们必须认识贫雇的感情、要求和我们的政策精神，是完全吻合的。他们对共产党的一切政策，是衷心拥护的，只要我们肯放下“官架子”，有事和贫雇商量，主动的到他们家中访心事，了解他们的困难和翻身情形，告诉他们各种政策，他们就会对我们讲出知心话。过去有些干部下乡，经常住在合作社或干部家里，使贫雇认为“干部吃的开，穷人吃不开”。这种只接近干部不接近群众的上层路线的作风，我们要坚决克服。\n    另外在发动贫雇中，还应启发他们的阶级自觉性与积极性。教育他们从阶级利益着想，在自己当家作主之后，养成有事和大家商量的民主作风。防止少数贫雇积极分子传染一些“包办一切”的不良作风。\n    以上这些问题必须在思想上，工作中明确的得到解决，才能贯彻贷款工作中的贫雇路线，才能把贷款工作做好。（冀南银行总行）"

    "content": "\"I want to fight back to Taiwan!\"\n　　An Autobiography of Industrial Worker Zeng Fuyuan\n　　Recorded by Bai Hua\n　　My name is Zeng Fuyuan, and I used to be an industrial worker in a sugar factory. There are three major ethnic groups in Taiwan: the Gaoshan people, who are the largest and oldest; the Guangdong people; and the Fujian people. I am a Guangdong person from Hsinchu County.\n　　My family had no fields, no land, and no house. When I was three years old, my mother died from overwork because we didn't have money for medicine. When I was eleven, the Japanese devils levied taxes and fees, and my father, working alone, couldn't make a living. The landlord forced my older sister away. After a few months, my father also coughed up blood from exhaustion. He wanted to eat something, but we had no money to buy anything. Day after day, he just dragged on until he breathed his last. I heard him say a few words: \"The wealthy landlord has taken your sister to use her like livestock. I'm so sick that I'm dying and can't even afford a coffin. Our family has been looked down upon for generations. You must be successful, you must...\"\n　　I was in elementary school at the time. I knew how my father had scrimped and saved to send me to school on a half-empty stomach. The more resentful I felt, the more I thought: \"The police are the most powerful! In the future, I'm going to take the police academy entrance exams. After graduating, I'll let my sister live a good life, and kill a few landlords and rich men to avenge my parents!\"\n　　At the time, being young, poorly educated, and unqualified was one thing, but we didn't even have anything to eat. What could I do? Life became increasingly difficult. We lived on sweet potatoes with salt water. On top of that, the Japanese devils wanted taxes, and if we couldn't pay, they would fine us, beat us, and curse us. As a result, a long strip of paper sealed our door.\n　　Year after year passed with difficulty. When I turned fourteen, the Japanese devils conscripted my older brother to be a military laborer in Southeast Asia. Later, he worked in a refreshment shop, working fourteen hours a day for only forty cents. My brother couldn't take care of himself, let alone me. I couldn't just drink the northwest wind on an empty stomach! So I had to go to work as a child laborer in the sugar factory, working twelve hours a day. I was so tired that I often fainted. Looking around, wanting to rest for a while, \"Bakayarō!\" \"Bang!\" The Japanese supervisor, holding a short wooden stick, beat and scolded me: \"You coolie devils! Earning fifty cents a day, not working hard, tearing, tearing!\" — It scared the soul right out of me!\n　　\"Okay! I'll earn money later, study hard, and take the police academy exams!\" At the time, while being beaten, I still wanted to become a police officer to take revenge. — I didn't know that the police were the running dogs of the Japanese devils and the rich men; becoming a police officer would only increase the claws of those cronies, unable to save my poor family and my fate of being beaten and abused. …\n　　The factory was damp and stuffy. I developed sores on my head, but they wouldn't give me medical treatment. Labor, labor, I developed sores, pus flowed all over my body, and they let me go. After my friends helped me heal, the factory owner deducted the wages for the past few dozen days, even taking away my original earnings. …\n　　These were all minor matters. The dangerous thing was when I was seventeen — during the hot days of 1944 and 1945, American planes desperately bombed Taiwan. I was assigned to repair the airport. People on the ground ran around in chaos, planes buzzed overhead, and bombs dropped non-stop with a deafening roar. We wanted to run, but the Japanese devils' machine guns nearby had already been set up. They couldn't hit the American planes, so like mad dogs, they just shouted and strafed us workers. A fellow worker fell! Then a second, a third, all the way to dozens. …\n　　I just lay on the ground, praying to the gods to protect us suffering workers. …\n　　The planes passed, and the strafing stopped. Looking around, dozens of people had died! — Deceived by the Japanese devils in the past, I thought that we should \"serve the Emperor loyally, and death is predetermined!\" But now I think: Weren't these dead people all our class brothers, sacrificed in the Japanese fascists' war? Capitalists and landlords enjoyed themselves in comfort, not coming to repair the airport, not getting killed; thinking about it, what \"Emperor\" and \"Gods\" aren't all deceiving us workers?! Rich men and Japanese devils all treat us as less than human, calling us to be their cannon fodder. …\n　　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★\n　　In October of the same year, the Kuomintang army came to Taiwan. We all thought: The \"Central Army\" has come and will definitely help us! We will definitely not live a hard life again! From then on, we saw the blue sky — I arrived in my own motherland.\n　　But what was the reality? The Kuomintang army brought even more ferocious burning, killing, raping, and plundering than the Japanese devils. Receiving officials flew everywhere, factories closed down, food was scarce, stores closed, and people were panicking. And incidents of swindling money, conscripting soldiers, raping, and killing became more and more frequent.\n　　\"Those who wish to enlist will receive a monthly salary of three thousand yuan, complete equality; you can learn boxing and culture, and be allowed to go home once every two weeks; at most two years, those who wish to continue can continue, those who do not wish to can retire to their fields or engage in other professions. …\"\n　　— What a beautiful \"dignified\" facade of the Kuomintang army's \"recruiting\"! How many Taiwanese youths were deceived! …\n　　I was an unemployed sugar worker, making sugar for others but suffering all my life. If I had known that the factory closures and our workers' lack of food were caused by this group of devils, I would rather have died than enlisted! And if I had known that the \"disaster army\" inside was so cruel to me, starving me, beating me, deceiving me left and right, and actually sending me to the civil war battlefield in North China to be cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek, to slaughter our own class brothers, I, my conscience! My conscience! I would have jumped into the sea or escaped early or fought them!\n　　I... knew nothing; we only complained about our bad luck, or said a few words: \"The dog (Japan) is gone, and the pig (Chiang Kai-shek) has come, — the dog can still guard the door, what's the use of the pig?\" to vent the anger in our chests. I... we only knew that we were not living a human life. Taiwan, poor and rich Taiwan, was still ruled by beasts! Old people shed tears, sighing and swallowing their voices; poor young people were livestock in the past, and are still cattle and horses today; young girls, who were originally beautiful, are now covered with endless pain and shame. According to our elders, we haven't seen the sun or light for a long time. \"Motherland!\" \"Motherland!\" The Kuomintang army \"Motherland\" that we enthusiastically celebrated and welcomed with tears! What they gave us was to lead us further into darkness, disaster, pain, hunger, and death!\n　　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★\n　　A great stroke of luck! This day last year — January 9th, the day of the major battle on the outskirts of Jining and Yutai; Heaven has eyes, I... we were finally liberated by the Communist People's Liberation Army!\n　　\"Liberated soldier,\" I used to feel sad when I heard about it; \"Liberated over!\" Isn't that just being captured?! Shame, dishonor, fear, feigning illness, eating and drinking, dazed... filled with bad ideas; in short, I was determined at the time: \"No matter who I fight for, I will never fight again!\"\n　　After one month, two months, three months... hearing and seeing; military and political education; the liberated area is really different! Poor old people are in charge, struggle against landlords, struggle against despots, distribute fields, distribute land, distribute houses, distribute property, distribute livestock; PLA leaders have no official airs, they are both loving and polite to themselves; feigning illness, the hospital clearly knows but still takes care of and treats them in every possible way; later, Chairman Mao also told the military region leaders to transfer us from the front to the military and political university to study. A worker who had always been oppressed, bullied, and looked down upon in the old society, today, unexpectedly, the hard times have come to an end, and he has become a \"liberated soldier,\" truly liberated! Sugar worker, sugar worker, my poor sugar worker, finally tasted the first sweetness in the world, and became a college student in Chairman Mao's university. Thinking back to when I was deceived by the \"disaster army\" to \"learn culture,\" the result was that they wanted us to be their cannon fodder for traitors. Unexpectedly, in the study at the Military and Political University, acting, singing, learning to read, attending classes, doing exercises, the culture of the motherland, the culture of the motherland, I never dreamed that it would be given to us by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao after liberation! …\n　　I am beginning to truly understand the deep and great meaning of the four words \"liberated soldier\"! The more I think about it, the happier I am, and the more motivated I become. A few days ago, I read the \"Land Law Outline,\" I read it over and over again, and also made some notes; thinking that my family has had no fields, no land, and no house for generations; if we fight back to Taiwan and establish a new Taiwan, thoroughly dividing the land according to the \"Land Law\" promulgated by the CCP Central Committee, struggling against landlords, and turning things over; then, my sister, brother, and all poor brothers and sisters will be extremely happy!\n　　This day last year — January 9th, I felt annoyed, angry, and sad whenever I mentioned or thought about it. Now I know that \"January 9th\" is equal to the revolutionary festival of the \"February 28th\" movement in which our Taiwan people opposed the heinous rule of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Chen Yi and his ilk, showing our rebirth, and being the most glorious, most joyful, and most happy day when we moved from darkness to light and from hell to paradise!\n　　Since that day, after various facts and education, I have gradually realized that this new world we have arrived at, this liberated area of the people, is precisely the real motherland we have longed for for a long time, the one we have encountered in all our disappointments! This, this is precisely the model of the new world that our Taiwan people need to fight for with blood and sweat to win!\n　　Even more interesting and promising is that from September 17th last year, a big red flower bloomed in my life — I, a sugar worker, a \"liberated soldier,\" was approved by the Military University Party Committee to become a member of the proletarian vanguard — the Communist Party!\n　　This is really... joyful, earth-shattering, something I would never have thought of in generations. At the time, I wrote this in my \"motives for joining the Party\":\n　　\"I saw in the battles at the front that the Communist PLA is indeed good, liberating me, and liberating many brothers like me. I also saw that Communist Party members are heroic, resolute and take the lead in completing tasks. From there, I felt that the Communist Party is good, and becoming one is glorious.\n　　After arriving at the school, I understood more about what the Communist Party does in Party classes; so in the class discussion, I asked to join the Communist Party.\n　　I am joining the Communist Party because it is a party that seeks happiness for the poor people; after joining, it is good to fight back to Taiwan under the leadership of the Communist Party and establish a new Taiwan where our workers and peasants are the masters.\"\n　　Yes! These words I wrote cannot be forgotten, not even a single word. This is an oath to the Party, and it is the direction of all my future actions and efforts!\n　　I am very young and very naive; I can't explain many things clearly, and I understand very few principles. However, Director Li of the Political Department gave us instructions on behalf of the Party Committee:\n　　\"Everyone must step up military, political, and cultural learning, improve tactics and techniques, and further clarify the class viewpoint; Taiwan is Taiwan of the workers and peasants of Taiwan, and Taiwan of the Chinese people! Liberating Taiwan requires the joint efforts of the people of the whole country! Especially our Taiwanese comrades, Taiwanese Communist Party members, must be even more prepared with their own strength!

As a glorious young Communist Party member, this should be even more my own task!\" — That night under the light, I firmly wrote these words in my diary again.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “我要打回台湾去！”　产业工人曾福源的自述\n\n1948-01-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“我要打回台湾去！”\n  　产业工人曾福源的自述\n    柏桦记录\n    我原来是个糖厂的产业工人，姓曾名福源。台湾有三大族：高山族最大也最久；还有广东族和福建族，我就是广东族新竹县人。\n    家里无田、无地、无房屋。三岁上，母亲因操劳过度，没钱吃药累死了。十一岁上，日本鬼抽税抽款，父亲一人劳动，不能维持生活，地主就硬逼着把我姐姐霸去了。不几月，父亲又累得吐血；想吃点东西，无钱买，一天一天拖着，就一直拖到断气的时候，听他说了几句话：“有钱的地主把你姐姐霸去当牲畜使唤，我病到这样死了连棺材也准备不起；咱们几辈子遭人白眼，你们一定要有出息，要有……”\n    我当时正念小学，我知道爸爸是怎样在饥一顿，饱一顿供我去念书的，心里越忿就越想：“警官是最威风的！将来我要去考警官学校，毕业后好叫我姐姐过几天好日子，杀几个地主老财，给我父母报了那冤仇！……”\n    当时，年纪小、程度差、资格低不用说，眼前连吃的都没有，可怎么办呢？生活越来越苦，盐水配着红薯过日子，加上日本鬼要税金，咱交不上，罚钱、打骂，结果一纸长条还封闭了我家门。\n    一年一年艰难的过去了，到了十四岁时，日本鬼又把哥哥征去南洋当军夫，后来入冷果店做工；一天做十四个钟头，只得四毛钱。哥哥顾不了自己，更顾不了我；我饿着肚子也不能餐餐喝西北风呀！就只得跑到糖工厂做童工，一天劳动十二点钟，累得我常常昏倒过去；瞅瞅四周，想歇一会儿吧！“八格牙牙罗！”“乒！”拿着短木棒的日本监工，连打连骂：“你们这些苦力小鬼！一天挣五毛钱，不好好干活，撕了撕了的！”——简直把我的魂都骇掉了！\n    “好吧！以后我赚了钱，念好书考了警官再说！”当时，我一边挨了打，一边还是想当警官报复报复的。——我不知道警官就是日本鬼子、老财们的走狗；当了警官只更增加那些狐群狗党的爪牙，救不了我那可怜的家庭和我这挨打受气的命。……\n    工厂潮湿而又闷气，头生疮了，不给医治；劳动、劳动，生了疮，一直流脓流到满身，放出去，等朋友们帮忙治好，结果，厂主又把过去几十天的工资，连老本也给我克去了。……\n    这些，也还是一堆小事，是危险的，那就是十七岁——四五年的热天，美国的飞机拼命的轰炸台湾，我被派去修理飞机场；地上的人乱跑，天上的飞机嗡嗡地东飞西飞，轰隆隆的不停的扔炸弹；我们想跑吧，附近日本鬼子的机枪又早已安置好了；它打不上美国飞机，就象疯狗样只是吆喝着，扫射着咱们这些做工的人们；一个工友倒下去了！接着是第二、第三，一直到数十个。……\n    我当时只是卧倒在地上，祈祷着神灵，要保佑我们这些受苦受难的工人………。\n    飞机过去了，扫射也停止了，周围一看，死了几十个人啊！——过去受日本鬼子的骗，只以为应该“尽忠天皇陛下，死了也是命定的！”而现在想想：死了的这些人还不都是我们阶级的兄弟，作了日本法西斯战争的牺牲品，资本家、地主自在享福，既不来修飞机场，又不致被打死；想来想去，什么“天皇”、“神仙”，还不都是期侮咱工人！？老财、日本鬼，还不都是把咱不当人，叫咱替他作送死鬼么。……\n    　　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★\n    同一年十月，国民党军队开到台湾来了。我们都想：“中央军”来了一定要救济咱们的！一定再不过苦日子了！我们从此见了青天——我到了自己的祖国了。\n    但是，事实是怎样呢？国民党军队带来的，却是比日本仔更凶的烧、杀、淫、掠；接收大员满天飞，工厂倒闭，粮食恐慌，商店关门，人心惶惶；而骗钱、骗兵、奸淫、杀人的事情，更是越来越多了。\n    “愿当兵者，每月饷金三千元，完全平等；可学打拳与文化，每两周准许回家一次；最多两年时间，愿再干者可干下去，不愿者可解甲归田或从事其他职业。……”\n    ——好漂亮的“堂堂乎”国民党军“招兵”的幌子呵！把多少台湾青年都哄骗进去了！……\n    我是个失业的糖工，给别人制糖，自己却吃了一辈子苦。我如果知道当时工厂倒闭，咱们这伙工人没饭吃就是这群混世魔王搞的鬼，我宁死也绝不去当兵！又如果知道“遭殃军”里边是那么坑我、饿我、打我，左欺右骗的竟把我送到华北内战战场上替蒋介石当炮灰，来屠杀的又是咱们自己的阶级弟兄，我，天良！天良！我也是要跳海或早逃跑或与他干起来的！\n    我……什么也不知道；我们当时只是埋怨命运不好，或说几句：“狗（日本）走了，猪（蒋介石）又来了，——狗还能看门，猪来何用？”以发泄发泄胸中郁气。我……我们只知道过的不是人过的生活；台湾，可怜的富庶的台湾，仍然被禽兽统治着！老人们流着眼泪，叹气吞声；穷苦的青年人过去当牲畜，今天还是当牛马；青春的姑娘，本来是漂亮，今天却蒙上了说不完的痛苦和羞辱。我们，据老辈子说，老早就见不到太阳，见不到光明；“祖国！”“祖国！”我们所热烈狂欢，流着眼泪所迎来的国民党军“祖国”呵！给我们的，都是叫我们更加走向黑暗、灾难、痛苦、饥饿、死亡！\n    　　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★\n    天大的幸事！去年的今天——一月九日，金乡鱼台外围大战的那一天；苍天有眼，我……我们总算被共产党解放军把我解放过来了！\n    “解放战士”，以前我一听说就难过；“解放过来了！”那还不就是俘虏过来了吗！？羞耻、不光荣、害怕、装病、吃吃喝喝，昏昏沉沉……装满了一脑袋坏主意；总之，我当时狠了几狠：“不管为谁打，我是再也不愿打仗了！”\n    经过一月、两月、三月……耳闻、目见；军事、政治，开会教育；解放区可真是不同！穷苦老百姓当家、斗地主、斗恶霸、分田、分地、分房子、分财产、分牲畜；解放军首长没官架子，对自己既爱护又客气；自己装病，医院明知道还是百般照顾、治疗；以后，毛主席又告诉军区首长，从前方调咱们来军政大学学习，一个在旧社会从来被人压迫、欺侮、瞧不起的工人，今天，想不到，苦尽甜来，当了“解放战士”，果真得了解放！糖工，糖工，我好苦命的糖工，竟尝到了人世间的第一次甜头，当了毛主席大学里的大学生了。想当年被“遭殃军”骗去“学文化”，结果是要我们当他们卖国贼的炮灰。想不到，在军政大学的学习里，演戏、唱歌、识字、上课、出操，祖国的文化，祖国的文化呵，连作梦也想不到，竟在被解放后由共产党、毛主席给与我们了！………\n    我是开始真正懂得“解放战士”这四个字的又深又大的意义了！我越想越高兴，也就越有了劲。前几天，我看了“土地法大纲”，我读了一遍又一遍，还作了一些笔记；想着自己几辈子没田、没地、没房屋；如果打回台湾去，建立起新台湾，按照中共中央公布的“土地法”彻底平分土地、斗地主、闹翻身；咱，咱姐姐、哥哥，所有穷兄弟、姊妹，可也就快活得不行了！\n    去年的今天——一月九日，当时一提起，一思想，就感到恼火，气忿，伤心。现在已经知道了，“一·九”正等于咱们台湾人民反对蒋匪陈仪辈狗徒的万恶统治，所爆发的“二·二八”运动的革命节日一样，是显示了我们的新生，是我们由黑暗走向光明、由地狱进入天堂的最光荣、最愉快、最感觉幸福的一天了！\n    从那天起，经过各种事实的证明与教育，使我渐渐认识到，我们所到了的这新天地，这人民的解放区，这不就正是我们渴望了很久，在一切的失望中所遇到的真正的祖国！这，这不就正是咱们台湾人民需要用血汗去斗争以赢得的新天地的模型！？\n    更有一桩使我最感兴趣，最感前途远大的，就是：从去年九月十七日起，我的生命里开了一朵大红花——我，一个糖工，一个“解放战士”，被军大党委批准成为无产阶级先锋队——共产党的一员了！\n    这对于我实在是………欢天喜地，惊天动地，几辈子。也不会想到有今天的。我当时在“入党的动机的”里这么写着：\n    “我在前方战斗里，看见共产党解放军的确是好，解放了我，也解放了和我一样的许多弟兄。我也看见共产党员英勇、坚决带头完成任务。从那里我就感到共产党好，当上光荣。\n    到学校后，上党课更明白共产党是干什么的了；所以在班里讨论时，我就要求参加共产党。\n    我参加共产党，是因为这是个替穷苦人民谋幸福的党；参加后，好在共产党领导下，打回台湾去，建立咱们工农当主人的新台湾。”\n    是的！我写的这些话是一句一字也不能忘记的。这是对党的誓言，也就是我今后一切行动努力的方向！\n    我很年青，很幼稚；许多意思都说不太清楚，懂道理也懂得很少。但，政治部李主任代表党委给我们的指示：\n    “大家必需要加紧军、政、文化学习，提高战术与技术，进一步明确阶级观点；台湾是台湾工农的台湾，中国人民的台湾！解放台湾要全国人民共同努力！特别是我们台湾同志，台湾的共产党员，要更加准备好自己的力量！认清时局，认清敌我；认清自己解放自己的任务，首先要靠自己有智谋，有勇气，有力量去担当！去坚决的完成与争取最后的胜利！……”——这，这简短而有力的教导呵，我是永远不能忘记的。\n    “解放台湾，这首先是我们自己的任务！我，作为一个光荣的年青的共产党员，这更应当是我自己的任务！”——当天夜里在灯光下，我又结结实实的把这些话记在了自己的日记本上。"

    "content": "Every Village Should Conduct Inspections\n  　Xingcheng's Eight Impoverished Households Suffer Hunger and Cold\n    [Ping Shun News] Xingcheng Village in the seventh district of Pingshun County is considered a large village in the entire district. The work on the surface appears to be good, but in reality, the impoverished peasants have not achieved liberation. The cadres are very active in their work, but they have a problem in their thinking. They believe that the impoverished peasants have already been thoroughly liberated. On January 13th, a household-by-household inspection was conducted in the village, going deep into the homes of impoverished peasants. In the three days until the 15th, it was discovered that eight households had no quilts to cover themselves, and one household had no cotton clothes to change into. For example, the impoverished peasant Shen Jixing's family has four members and six mu of land (inferior land, producing a total of four shi of grain), averaging one shi of grain per person. During the filling and leveling compensation last year, he repeatedly requested a quilt, but the village cadres did not respond. He was very active at the beginning of the struggle, but he didn't even get a quilt, and he didn't dare to ask for other fruits of the revolution. Li Wu is the most honest farmer, living in a mountain gully. His family has two members, cultivating hillside land. Now, there is no food at home to make a living. Not only is there no quilt on the kang, but there isn't even a broken mat. We asked him why he hadn't achieved thorough liberation. He said, \"I am an honest farmer, and nothing I say matters.\" Li Panghan's family has four members and seven mu of land, actually harvesting five shi of grain. He said that he is an outsider. His father came here to work as a long-term laborer to make a living, and he also worked as a long-term laborer for three years. He started herding cattle at the age of eight and has been herding cattle for eleven years until he turned eighteen. The kang at home is covered with a broken quilt, with no benefits at all, just a pile of rags. He said, \"When the village cadres notify us of meetings and errands, we arrive immediately. But when it comes to distributing the fruits of the revolution, they look down on us, and nothing we say matters. There isn't even a water vat at home. I said I wanted a small water vat, but the village cadres wouldn't allow it, scaring me so much that I didn't dare to mention anything. I think I am an outsider and can't get anywhere.\" His father continued, \"I heard on the street that land will be divided soon, allowing the poor to take power and achieve liberation. I think I can achieve thorough liberation this time.\" In addition, there are five other households whose liberation is not thorough enough, and they currently have no quilts to cover themselves. After discovering this problem, the village chief, political director, and cooperative director were brought to personally inspect the homes of the eight impoverished peasants. The village cadres were speechless. A village cadre meeting was held at night to review whether there were any impoverished peasant viewpoints. The village chief, political director, and cooperative director reviewed: In the past, we shouted slogans about following the impoverished peasant line all winter, but as a result, the difficulties of the impoverished peasants were not resolved. From the rent reduction movement and struggle in 1942 until now, there are still these impoverished peasants without quilts, proving that the work is not thorough. After the review, everyone was determined to first solve the immediate difficulties of these families.

    "content": "One-Sided Emphasis on the Interests of the Poor and Hired Peasants\n  　Should Check Whether Middle Peasants Are Satisfied\n  　Please Provide a Public Response from the Tongtan Work Group\n[Zuoquan News] At the summary meeting of the two-month winter production in Tongtan on January 15th, cadres discussed following the route of poor and hired peasants. Zhao Wanlu, chairman of the farmers' association, said: \"When organizing winter production, we talked about patching holes, but we didn't know who had big holes and who had small holes, so we couldn't talk about solving the difficulties of the households with holes. We only saw that the entire village's livestock and labor were organized, very enthusiastic, and making a lot of money, but we didn't see the poor and hired peasants who didn't participate in the movement.\" Comrade Zhang Lianzhen, manager of the Sixth Brigade Mutual Aid Society, said: \"This year's winter production must follow the line of the poor and hired peasants. Before, we didn't know who the poor and hired peasants were. Later, we heard Guo Shihe reflect on the street: Others have livestock and labor and can produce, but we don't have livestock or labor, how can we become rich? I only realized that the poor and hired peasants had difficulties, but it was already more than a month late.\" Li Farong, manager of the Farmers' Cooperative, said: \"The credit cooperative supported transportation with 360,000 yuan, 300,000 yuan to new middle peasants, and 60,000 yuan to old middle peasants, but did not pay attention to the poor and hired peasants who had not been thoroughly turned over.\" During the discussion, everyone realized that the achievements of this year's winter production were not small, but the poorest of the poor and hired peasants did not get much. Finally, everyone decided: First, we must go deep into the poor and hired peasants, understand their difficulties, and overcome bureaucratic work styles; we cannot only listen to the reports of the team leaders. Second, organize the poor and hired peasants to do whatever they are good at; for example, the old man Zhang Xicai was originally asked to open a shop, but he could neither carry water nor make noodles. Later, we learned that he could peel hemp, so we gave him hemp to peel, earning 600 yuan a day, which he did with great enthusiasm. The old man Zhang Guixi could not do labor, but he could sell some goods, so the mutual aid society let him sell salt every time he went to the market. Third, let the poor and hired peasants do whatever is most profitable. In the past, some good deals were either done exclusively by the mutual aid society or were done by people with labor and skills. For example, the mutual aid society opened a shop, which was very profitable, but the money earned was distributed to others because the poor and hired peasants had few shares. The poor and hired peasants hauled coal every day, which took a lot of effort but earned little money. For example, Shen Heidan earned 20,000 yuan in more than forty days. Later, after calculation, the leakage could not make up for the hole, so he proposed to transform the shop, and earned 10,000 yuan in just half a month. Another example is sending vinegar from the vinegar shop to Xijing in Licheng, which cost 20 yuan per catty and was very profitable. It also included a meal, but the poor and hired peasants were not allowed to do it. Later, Qu Yinxi was allowed to do it, earning 1,600 yuan a day. After this discussion, everyone's thinking became clear and sober, and everyone said in unison: If the working class viewpoint is not clear, there is no way to do a good job. Now everyone is determined to go deep into the poor and hired peasants, listen to their opinions, and strive to serve them. (Tongtan Second Special Work Group, Tongtan Correspondent Group)\n\nEditor's Note: The determination of the Tongtan village cadres to serve the poor and hired peasants is good, but the approach is not very good. It is easy to cause dissatisfaction among the middle peasants and isolate the poor and hired peasants by having the leadership solve the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants in isolation and letting the poor and hired peasants do all the beneficial things. Therefore, the best way is to let the poor and hired peasants rise up themselves, unite the middle peasants, and discuss production together. What are the reactions of the middle peasants to your approach? What are the reactions of the poor and hired peasants? We hope that you can check and give a public reply, so that we can get a correct conclusion on this issue.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 片面强调贫雇利益　应检查中农是否满意　请桐滩工作组公开答复\n\n1948-01-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　片面强调贫雇利益\n  　应检查中农是否满意\n  　请桐滩工作组公开答复\n    【左权消息】桐滩干部于一月十五日总结两月冬产会上，座谈走贫雇路线。农会主席赵万禄说：“组织冬季生产时说的是补窟窿，但不知道谁是深窟窿，谁是小窟窿，也就谈不上解决窟窿户的困难。只看到全村牲口劳力都组织了起来，很热烈，赚钱不少，对没参加运动的贫雇却没有看见。”六大队互助社经理张连珍同志说：“今年冬产要走贫雇路线，以前咱也不知道谁是贫雇，后来在街上听见郭世和反映：人家有牲口、有劳力能生产，咱没有牲口、劳力，怎能发家致富？我才知道贫雇有困难，但已误了一个多月。”农民合作社经理李发荣同志说：“信用社扶植运输贷出大洋三十六万元，新中农三十万元，旧中农六万元，而没有注意到未翻透身的贫雇。”在座谈中大家认识了今年冬季生产成绩不小，可是窟窿最大的贫雇，得的不多。最后大家决定：第一、要深入贫雇，了解他们困难，要克服官僚主义作风，不能光听小组长汇报。第二、贫雇会干啥就组织啥；如张喜才老汉原来让他去开店房，可是他既不能担水，又不能下面，后来了解他会拔麻皮，就给他揽麻，一天赚六百元，干的很有劲。张贵喜老汉劳动活不能作，可是他会卖些货，每逢赶集，互助社就让他去卖盐。第三、什么利最大，就让贫雇干，过去有些好买卖，不是互助社独干，就是让有劳力有本事的人干了，如互助社开了店房，很赚钱，可是赚下的钱，贫雇农入的股少，都给旁人分了。贫雇每天拉煤炭，出力大赚钱少。如申黑旦四十多天，赚得二万元，后来计算了一下，漏补不住窟窿，才提出改造店房，干了将够半月，就赚一万元。又如醋房往黎城西井送醋，一斤二十元，利很大，去了还管饭一顿，就没让贫雇去干，后来才让渠银喜干，一天可赚洋一千六百元。经过这次座谈，大家思想上明确了清醒了，一致说：什么工作阶级观点不明确，就没法子做好。现在大家决心深入贫雇，倾听贫雇意见，努力为贫雇服务。（桐滩二专工作组、桐滩通讯组）\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    编者意见：桐滩村干部为贫雇服务的决心是好的，但做法不大对，由领导上孤立的去解决贫雇困难，把有利的事情都让给贫雇做，这样很容易引起中农的不满，造成贫雇的孤立。因此最好的办法是让贫雇自己起来，团结中农，大家一块儿商量着搞生产。你们的作法中农有啥反映？贫雇有啥反映？望能检查后公开答复，这样我们对这一问题就能得到一个正确的结论。"

    "content": "Short Commentary:\n\n    Lessons from the Leikou Incident\n\n    The Leikou Village branch in Anyang was infiltrated by landlords and rich peasants, undermining the peasant emancipation movement, forcing the village head, who was from a poor peasant background, to death, resulting in a heartbreaking loss. This incident also provides a profound understanding of how wise Chairman Mao's call to reorganize the Party ranks and the Central Bureau's \"Letter to Party Members\" are.\n\n    In the land reform, the landlords and bad elements in Leikou Village were unable to openly and legally strike at the peasant movement. Therefore, they adopted even more despicable methods, pretending to be active in joining the Party, luring lackeys to seize leadership of the branch, putting the label of \"special agent\" on the heads of peasants, and murdering the village head who was from a poor peasant background. Such incidents are probably not limited to Anyang, and all localities should be vigilant. In the past, some of our comrades, upon mentioning a Communist Party member or branch, immediately held a sectarian view of \"one of us,\" a \"member of the family.\" In the Party, they did not primarily view people and matters from the fundamental class standpoint and class interests. Consequently, they lost class vigilance, allowing landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements to exploit this \"one of us\" loophole to harm genuine members of our own ranks. Chairman Mao said well in his report \"The Present Situation and Our Tasks\": \"That is, many landlord elements, rich peasant elements, and hooligan elements take the opportunity to infiltrate our Party.

We should also organize people's tribunals in the land redistribution movement, severely punish these criminals, and hand them over to the people for trial.

He also ordered the peasants to register their \"lease contracts\" and forced them to pay rent to the landlords. A large number of peasants lost their land again and lived by working as farmhands. The Chiang bandits also stipulated that hired laborers must not \"absent themselves from work without reason,\" and those who violate this regulation will have their wages deducted on a daily basis.

It is necessary to immediately implement the leadership policy of \"unified planning, decentralized leadership\": that is, after collective consultation, responsible cadres from the column to the regiment level should take turns going down to the lower levels regularly for on-the-spot guidance, on-the-spot supervision and inspection, on-the-spot summary of experience, and on-the-spot education of cadres. Leadership organs at all levels must take most of their work down to the lower levels, and link the understanding of the situation, the implementation of leadership, the completion of tasks, and the study of experience to avoid the phenomenon of separation between upper and lower levels. It is necessary to check work in a timely manner, discover problems in a timely manner, correct deviations, and exchange experiences, without waiting for a battle or a task to be completely completed before proceeding.

    "content": "Reader's Letter:\n\n　　Poor Peasant Zhang Wanfang of Jile Village Requests to Get Rid of His Landlord Wife\n  　Local Leaders Should Resolve This Immediately\n\nEditor Comrade:\n    Zhang Wanfang of Jile Village is in his fifties. He worked as a farmhand for others from the age of fourteen until he was over forty, when he finally returned home and bought more than twenty mu of poor land to cultivate. His wife died of worry during the famine of 1942 because they couldn't make a living, leaving behind two daughters who have both married. He lives with his eldest son's wife and two sons (the second son is seventeen, and the third son is over ten, neither of whom are married).\n    Last year, in the twelfth lunar month, Zhang married the wife of the village landlord Wang ×× (age fifty-six). Last year, in the first lunar month, his wife's son-in-law came for the holiday. His wife asked Zhang Wanfang to butcher meat and buy wine for her son-in-law (who is also a landlord). Zhang Wanfang refused because he was short of money. This made her unhappy. That evening, she got angry with Zhang Wanfang and lay down on the kang, refusing to get up. Zhang Wanfang, to get through the days, spoke nicely to her, but she wouldn't listen, and he pleaded with her again and again. His wife said, \"If you want me to live with you, you must agree to my conditions: first, we must eat noodles every day; second, the clothes for your two sons (referring to Zhang Wanfang's two sons) must be sewn by my two daughters; third, I must have a constant allowance of pocket money.\" Zhang couldn't answer, and this caused a scene. She lay on the kang, just getting angry and not doing any work. Zhang Wanfang went to the fields to work, and when he came back for dinner in the evening, she had already eaten and gone to sleep, still acting like a landlord; she kept complaining that life wasn't as good as before, often saying how good life was in the landlord's house in the past. She doesn't want to work all day long. Throughout the year, she only made three cloth shirts, two pairs of trousers, and one lined outfit for herself, without doing any sewing for Zhang Wanfang and his three sons. Zhang Wanfang couldn't even say anything even when he had no clothes to wear. There was another quarrel during the Autumn Equinox festival over eating noodles. She also keeps stealing things. Once, she was caught stealing cloth, but she refused to admit it. The matter was brought to the Farmers' Association for struggle, but not only did she not change, but she became even angrier than before. She ran to her former daughter's house and wouldn't come back. After being brought back, she was still angry and wouldn't move. Zhang Wanfang couldn't bear it, and wanted to divorce her. The village cadres said, \"If you divorce her, you have to provide for her living expenses for three years. This is the government's policy, otherwise it won't work. Now you can't marry a landlord, and you can't divorce one either.\" Zhang Wanfang couldn't cope, and he has no heart for production. He is so anxious that he is willing to give up some things, even willing to let her go without anything. Now that the New Year is coming, he has nothing to wear, and the children need clothes. He hopes to know if he can get a divorce, and asks for justice. Please reply. (Lü Zhengtang, Guo Yuxiang, Wang Wanming, Lian Shuangjin)\n\n    Poor peasant Zhang Wanfang suffered a great loss by marrying a landlord's woman, and his request for divorce is completely reasonable. The local leadership should resolve this for him immediately. The village cadres are using laws to obstruct people arbitrarily. Zhang Wanfang has no way to appeal, which is caused by the bureaucracy of the past leadership. This style is very bad.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th—The Northeast Administrative Committee passed instructions regarding the issuance of agricultural loans and spring plowing preparation work. It roughly stated: In order to vigorously develop agriculture, increase grain production, better organize farmers' production, help hired and poor peasants solve some of their production funding difficulties, and adapt to the needs of developing special products such as cotton and hemp, it has been decided this year to issue 4.5 billion in interest-free agricultural loans. Last year's agricultural loans will be recovered (except for those unable to repay) and reissued along with this year's agricultural loans. The production movement based on the thorough and equal distribution of land to solve the production funds of hired and poor peasants relies mainly on confiscating the property of landlords and levying surplus property from rich peasants. All localities should pay attention to checking whether the property distributed to the masses is used for production and establishing a home and career, and prevent squandering and waste. The government's agricultural loans should be used in a focused and concentrated manner. The target of loan issuance should first be hired and poor peasants who lack draught animals and farm tools, and the distribution should be discussed and evaluated democratically through poor peasants' leagues or farmers' associations. The use of loans should focus on purchasing draught animals, seeds, restoring paddy fields, planting cotton, immigration, etc., and should not be diverted to other uses, nor should it be distributed equally. The distribution of loans should be based on the production plans of each county and careful calculations. After each province receives agricultural loans, they should be issued in a timely manner to coordinate with the equal distribution of land.\n\nThe instructions continued: Before spring plowing, the following preparatory work should be noted in terms of leadership: (1) Based on the overall task of increasing production, each province and county should formulate and inspect its own production plans, conduct detailed investigation and calculation as a basis for setting plans, complete, and strive to exceed the increase in grain production. (2) Adjust livestock locally and externally in a planned manner, establish livestock exchanges, mobilize urban livestock to go to the countryside, and reduce urban carriages. Border areas are strictly prohibited from exporting plowing cattle, strictly prohibit the slaughter of plowing cattle, and prevent winter and spring plagues of cattle. (3) Immigrants going to the countryside to engage in agricultural production can reduce urban consumption and increase rural labor. To help them settle down and start a business, governments at all levels should earnestly complete this work before spring plowing. For the land, housing, and some difficulties in production and life of immigrants, they should be practically solved according to the different conditions of the local area. The government's immigration loans can only solve part of the problem, and the main reliance is on the local government to organize the masses to solve the difficulties of immigrants. (4) After the land is broken up and distributed equally, the original reserved seeds may not be suitable. Areas with poor harvests last year feel that seeds are difficult. In addition to the masses exchanging them themselves, each province and county should select good seeds and special crop seeds and prepare for exchange. Restore local furnaces and blacksmith furnaces to help farmers manufacture and repair farm tools. (5) Mobilize and organize the masses to collect fertilizer, chop firewood, and engage in winter production, especially in some areas with poor harvests, attention should be paid to preparation to prevent spring famine, so as not to affect spring plowing. Special difficulties will be remedied by the provincial government and organized by the masses to help each other. (6) The construction departments of each province and the construction sections of county governments should strengthen investigation and research work. Summarize the experience of mass production organizations to prepare for the deployment of spring plowing work.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北发农贷四十五亿　集中使用，首先发给雇贫。由贫农团、农会讨论分配。\n\n1948-01-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北发农贷四十五亿\n  　集中使用，首先发给雇贫。由贫农团、农会讨论分配。\n    【新华社东北二十四日电】东北行政委员会通过关于发放农业贷款与春耕准备工作指示。略称：为大力发展农业，增产粮食，更好的组织农民生产，帮助雇贫农解决一部分生产资金困难，并适应发展棉麻等特产的需要，本年度决定发放四十五万万无息农业贷款，去年农贷收回（无力归还者除外）并入今年农贷重新发放。在深入平分土地基础上的生产运动，解决雇贫农生产资金主要是依靠没收地主财物及征收富农多余财物，各地应注意检查群众分到的财物，是否用在生产安家立业上，防止挥霍浪费。政府的农贷，应有重点的集中使用，发放贷款对象首先是缺乏耕畜农具的雇贫农，应经过贫农团或农会民主讨论评议分配。贷款用途着重在购买耕畜、种籽、恢复水田、植棉、移民等项，不能移作别用，不应平均分配。分配贷款应根据各县生产计划与精细计算。各省领到农贷之后，应及时发下去配合平分土地。\n    指示继说：春耕前在领导上应注意下列准备工作：（一）根据总的增产任务，各省县应制定与检查自己的生产计划，进行精细的调查计算，作为定计划的基础，完成并争取超过增产粮食。（二）有计划的在本地与外处调剂牲口，建立家畜交易所，动员城市牲口下乡，减少城市马车。边缘区严禁耕畜出境，严禁宰杀耕畜，防止耕畜冬瘟与春瘟。（三）移民下乡从事农业生产，减少城市消费，增加乡村劳动力，帮助其安家立业，各级政府应于春耕前切实完成这一工作。对于移民的土地房屋以及生产上与生活上的一些困难，应根据当地不同情况切实解决。政府的移民贷款只能解决一部分问题，主要的依靠当地政府组织群众力量去解决移民困难。（四）在土地打烂平分之后，原留的种籽不一定适用，去年歉收地区，种籽感到困难，除群众自己调换外，各省县应选好种与特种作物种籽，准备调换。恢复各地铧炉与铁匠炉，帮助农民制造与修补农具。（五）动员与组织群众集肥、打柴以及冬季生产，尤其是某些歉收地区更应注意准备，防止春荒，以免影响春耕。特殊困难者由省府设法救济与组织群众互助。（六）各省建设厅、县府建设科应加强调查研究工作。总结群众生产组织经验，以准备布置春耕工作。"

The rear service office requested the government to order district and village cadres to be responsible. The government agreed and strictly ordered the entire county to do this work in a concentrated manner. At that time, the main cadres of the Gujiao District were not present, and Duan Chengzhi of the × Column's rear service office himself mobilized Niu Lianzhong, a third-class demobilized soldier (currently the manager of the cooperative), in Shangshanghe Village, Gujiao District, to return to the team. Niu Lianzhong was unwilling to go, and Duan Chengzhi beat Lianzhong until he couldn't move. In Hengshui District, a demobilized soldier returned from the sub-district, and they insisted on taking him back in less than ten days. Only after many people spoke up was he allowed to stay. In Gujiao District, a military dependent's son came back to visit relatives, and Duan Chengzhi insisted on taking him. The comrade quickly ran back to his original unit, and Duan Chengzhi beat the military dependent everywhere with a stick, saying that he shouldn't have been taken away. When they find demobilized or retired soldiers, they ask, \"Do you have a demobilization certificate?\" Once people take it out, they don't give it back. They arrest the retired soldiers and take them to the rear service headquarters. The retired soldiers ask the rear service office for their certificates, but the rear service office says they have been handed over to the higher authorities and won't give them back. They also exchange the new clothes that people wear at home for old and torn ones and send them back without paying travel expenses. Now the administrative office has ordered that no random arrests are allowed without an order from the major military region. It is hoped that the troops will be informed not to arrest people indiscriminately. If there are deserting soldiers, it is hoped that the county and district governments will organize mobilization to stabilize the emotions of retired soldiers and reassure them in their production. (Lian Chuanfang)\n    To mobilize deserting soldiers to return to the team, the troops should go through a certain organization and ask the local party and government organs to handle it in a planned and unified manner. The troops directly taking action will inevitably hinder social order and cause unrest among retired soldiers, which cannot be allowed and should be stopped immediately. As for beating people and exchanging and stripping clothes..., these are even more illegal acts. It is hoped that the × Column's rear service office will conduct an in-depth inspection and correction, and it should be noted whether some bad people are causing trouble.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 制止乱抓逃亡战士\n连传芳\n1948-01-26\n第1版()\n专栏：批评与建议\n\n　　制止乱抓逃亡战士\n    去年十二月，×纵队留守处写一介绍信来陵川找逃亡战士归队，留守处要求政府命令区村干部负责。政府答应了，严令全县都突击做这工作。当时古郊区主要干部不在，×纵队留守处的段成志自己在古郊区上上河村动员三等荣退军人牛连中（现任合作社经理）归队。牛连中不愿去，段成志就把连中打的不能动了。横水区一个荣退军人从分区退伍回来，不到十天，又非叫他去不行。经好多人说才算是留下了。古郊区有军属儿子回来探亲，段成志非叫他去不行，该同志赶快跑回原部队，段成志拿着棍到处打这个军属，说不该叫走了。他们找着退伍或荣退军人，就问你有退伍证没有？人家一拿出来，就不给人家了。他们把荣退军人都抓到留守总处，荣退军人和留守处要证，但留守处说交了上级，不给人家，并将人家在家穿的新衣服换成破的，不发路费放回来。现在行署有命令：没有大军区命令不准乱抓。希转告该部队不要乱抓，如有逃亡战士，希经县区政府有组织的动员，使荣退军人稳定情绪，安心生产。（连传芳）\n    动员逃亡战士归队，部队应该经过一定组织，请地方党政机关有计划的统一处理。部队直接下手，必然会妨碍社会秩序，引起荣退军人不安，这是不能允许的，应该立刻制止。至于打人、换剥衣服……，更是犯法的行为，希望×纵留守处深入检查纠正，并应注意是不是有些坏人从中捣鬼。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 23rd: In the past ten months of the self-defense war, the people of the Border Region have made tremendous contributions to supporting the front. According to incomplete statistics from the four sub-regions of Yanshu, Suide, Longdong, and Sanbian (missing four counties): a total of 843,199 laborers and 715,289 livestock were mobilized, including 20,000 temporary and accompanying stretchers (sporadic mobilization not included). At the beginning of the war, wartime service mobilization lacked strict organization and the work was chaotic, resulting in unfair burdens in some places. It was not until July of last year that the four months of wartime service mobilization work was initially summarized, and the principle of shared labor and wealth was determined, which was supported by poor and lower-middle peasants.\n\n　　Stretcher transport is the main aspect of wartime service mobilization. In the early stages of the war, many areas lacked ideological mobilization and mostly adopted coercive methods. The support teams lacked core leadership, so there were individual cases of desertion. Later, the accompanying stretcher teams were improved. First, cadres were sent to the countryside to conduct ideological mobilization. Each group was equipped with an activist, and county government officials were responsible as the captain and political commissar to establish a leadership core, thus consolidating the organization. Furthermore, due to the army's emphasis on wartime service work, the following achievements and experiences were gained: (1) Army mass work cadres participated in the leadership of the stretcher teams, strengthened ideological education, and respected local cadres, achieving close cooperation. (2) Usually, they are managed centrally, but during wartime they are used in a decentralized manner to reduce waste. (3) Care for the lives of the laborers. During combat, mass work cadres personally take care of the laborers' meals and set up water and food stations for the laborers. (4) Promoting democracy. A mass work cadre of a certain regiment cursed at the laborers during a forced march, but later accepted the laborers' criticism and gained their trust. (5) Paying attention to the safety of the laborers, such as providing timely medical treatment for the laborers and hiding them during wartime to avoid casualties. (6) Commending and rewarding models, such as holding farewell meetings and awarding commendation meetings after the stretcher teams completed their tasks. (7) Promoting the spirit of the people loving the people, mobilizing laborers to help poor people in the驻地（garrison） with production, and strengthening mass discipline. (8) Creating model groups and cultivating model laborers in combat to become the backbone. Sacrifices were given condolences, and a deep friendship was established between the laborers and the troops.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 十个月爱国自卫战争　陕甘宁八十万民工支援前线\n\n1948-01-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　十个月爱国自卫战争\n  　陕甘宁八十万民工支援前线\n    【新华社西北二十三日电】在过去十个月自卫战争中，边区人民对支前贡献了巨大力量，据延属、绥德、陇东与三边四个分区（缺四个县）的不完全统计：共动员民工八十四万三千一百九十九人，牲口七十一万五千二百八十九头，其中临时及随军担架即达两万付。（零星动员尚未计入），战争初期战勤动员缺乏严密组织，工作紊乱，致使在某些地方负担不公，直至去年七月才初步总结了四个月的战勤动员工作，确定劳财共负方针，得到贫雇农拥护。担架运输为战勤动员中主要方面。在战争初期不少地区缺乏思想动员，多采取强迫命令方式，支前队伍缺乏核心领导，因此曾发生个别逃亡现象，后来改进了随军担架队，首先派干部下乡进行思想动员，每组配备一个积极分子，以县府负责干部为大队长、政委，建立领导核心，因之组织巩固。并由于部队重视战勤工作，获得如下成绩及经验：（一）部队民运干部参加担架队的领导，加强思想教育，尊重地方干部，达到密切合作。（二）平时集中管理，战时则分散使用，减少浪费。（三）关心民工生活，战斗时民运干部亲自照料民工的伙食，并为民工设水站、饭站。（四）发扬民主，某团民运干部在急行军中，催促民工骂了两句，后来接受民工批评，获得民工信仰。（五）注意民工安全，如及时为民工治病，战时使其隐蔽，以免伤亡。（六）表功奖模，如在担架队完成任务，开欢送大会，开计功给奖大会。（七）发扬民爱民精神，发动民工帮助驻地贫苦人民生产，加强群众纪律。（八）在战斗中创造模范组，培养模范民工，成为骨干。对牺牲者予以抚衅，民工与部队之间建立了深厚友谊。"

    "content": "Masses in the Sixth District of Huguan Decide:\n  　No Waste During the Old Lunar New Year\n    [Huguan News] In Shuzhang, Qiaoshang, and other villages in the sixth district of Huguan, some people are preparing for the New Year by putting down production and planning to have a good feast. Some middle peasants have misunderstood the Land Law and are also thinking of taking advantage of the New Year to eat and drink extravagantly. Most of the women have stopped spinning and are doing needlework, sewing shoes and socks, in preparation for the New Year. Out of a total of 198 women who spin in Shuzhang Village, an actual check revealed that 77 were spinning cotton, 63 were making shoes and socks, and most of the remaining 58, except for a few who had children or were sick, were also doing miscellaneous things for the New Year. Of the 27 constantly working looms in the village, seven have now been idled. The situation is similar in Qiaoshang Village, where women are sewing socks and making shoes, preparing to grind corn flour and steam steamed buns for the New Year. It seems that spinning is about to collapse. The two small-scale cooperatives in Shuzhang are preparing to buy flour and distribute it to the masses for the New Year. Gui Fu said, \"I invested 80,000 yuan in this small cooperative to buy some flour and distribute it to the masses to solve the New Year's difficulties.\" Zhao Jinshui said, \"We've turned ourselves around. Others are eating meat. Even if we have to create a famine, we have to buy a dozen or so pounds of flour to celebrate the New Year.\" Some people have misconceptions about the Land Law and also want to waste. Prosperous middle peasant Qin Song said, \"Flour costs 320 yuan per pound. We'll sell some hemp and buy some flour for the New Year.\" Middle peasant Nie Yongfu from Shatan said, \"We have to take advantage of the New Year to eat a few good meals quickly. During the New Year, no one pays much attention. After the New Year, who knows if it's up to us.\" Based on these situations, first, we thoroughly publicized the principle of equally distributing land, relying on hired and poor peasants, and uniting with middle peasants, so that middle peasants who have misconceptions about the Land Law correctly understand that hired and poor peasants and middle peasants are one family and will not harm the interests of middle peasants. We also raised the question: Do we want to celebrate the New Year by working hard in production to welcome the New Year, or do we want to stop production and wait for the New Year? Is it better to waste during the New Year or to save? Finally, we also proposed to break old customs, not to waste, and to visit fewer relatives. Niu Shuan from Shuzhang said, \"My family alone has nine relatives. If we steam steamed buns to visit relatives, my family would have to use at least three dou. It's much easier not to visit, saving effort to spin more cotton, which is much better.\" Li Hong then said, \"The New Year is easy to get through, but the days are hard to get through. If we eat everything during the New Year, we won't have the energy to farm. If we save grain during the New Year and eat it while planting, we'll have extra energy.\" The old mother of military dependent Wang Nianjiu was worried that she wouldn't have anything good for the New Year. Finally, her son, Gen Gen, solved the problem for her, saying, \"During the famine year, we weren't even full on cornmeal on the first day of the New Year. Didn't we still celebrate the New Year? This year is also a famine year, and we can't go into debt to celebrate the New Year again.\" Women like Ge Lou said, \"It's good not to steam steamed buns, saving us from grinding the mill. It also frees up time to spin more.\" After everyone discussed, the problem was solved ideologically. Everyone not only resumed spinning but also worked harder. Shuzhang launched a half-month (from the eighth to the twenty-third of the lunar month, ending on the twenty-third, after which everyone started preparing for the New Year) intensive spinning campaign, setting a fifteen-day intensive plan. All 198 spinning women in the village were to spin 829 jin of cotton in fifteen days. The whole village did not steam steamed buns, saving an average of two dou per household, totaling 79 shi of grain for 298 households. Women in Qiaoshang Village also spun an additional 260 jin, saving more than two dou of grain per household for the New Year, totaling 49 shi of grain for 215 households in the village. Finally, everyone discussed that they should still improve their lives in the New Year, but they cannot go into debt because of the New Year.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 24th: Our army has launched an offensive operation north of the Daqing River. On the evening of the 18th, we once again liberated Xiong County, about 90 li northeast of Baoding, annihilating a part of the bandit security brigade. On the 19th, our army continued to advance northeast, immediately recovering Jiugang (20 li northeast of Xiong County), Daying (20 li north of Xiong County), Shakou (40 li north of Xiong County), Banjiawo (35 li northeast of Xiong County), Kaikou (15 li west of Xinzhen), Niutuo (20 li southwest of Yongqing), Nanmeng (15 li north of Ba County), Chaheji (10 li west of Ba County), Maoerwan (15 li southwest of Xinzhen) and other villages and towns. On the 21st, Ba County was successively recovered. All the Chiang Kai-shek puppet fortifications north of the Daqing River were completely cleared by our forces. Detailed battle results are currently being investigated. Currently, a vast area north of the Daqing River, east to Anci and Shengfang, west to the east bank of the Daqing River, north to the south bank of the Yongding River, and south between Xiong County and Xinzhen, has been liberated once again.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 23rd: A front-line reporter commented on this great victory on the northern front, saying: Just as Fu Zuoyi took office as the \"Commander-in-Chief for Communist Suppression\" in North China, our Jin-Cha-Ji forces, in coordination with the Northeast Liberation Army's winter offensive, launched a large-scale raiding war centered on Pingjin and Baoding around the New Year. Following our army's sweeping of the outposts around Baoding with a part of our forces on the 7th and 8th, directly approaching the suburbs of Baoding, Fu Zuoyi urgently adjusted the Third Army, the Ninety-Fourth Army, the Sixteenth Army, and two divisions of the Thirty-Fifth Army to move south along the west side of the Pingbao line to relieve the siege, suffering more than 4,000 casualties along the way. Having just arrived in Baoding and not yet catching his breath, our northern route army suddenly launched a fierce attack on Laishui city at dusk on the 11th, quickly occupying the four gates. Bandit Fu urgently dispatched the New Thirty-Second Division and the 101st Division of the Thirty-Fifth Army to aid northward overnight. On the 12th, the New Thirty-Second Division had just advanced to Zhuangtuan and the north-south Yian line, more than ten li east of the city, when it was surrounded by our army. From the late night of the 12th, after 16 hours of fierce fighting, more than 2,000 men of the New Thirty-Second Division were completely annihilated, and the division commander, Li Mingding, was also killed by our forces. The 101st Division, another reinforcement, was also annihilated and captured by our forces in the Wucun and Gaoluo areas, more than ten li northwest of Dingxing, suffering more than 600 casualties. In addition, the Provisional 17th Division, which had rushed from the Ping-Sui Railway to reinforce, was also killed and wounded, with 500 men killed by our forces near Songlin Town, and fled in panic to Xincheng. In total, more than 7,000 enemies were annihilated in the entire campaign. When the Provisional Third Army, the Sixteenth Army, the Ninety-Fourth Army and other units turned around from Baoding to reinforce and relieve the siege, the battle had already ended victoriously. Bandit Fu's \"so brilliant\" \"art of command\" can truly be described as \"Wu Dalang playing with a pole, unable to reach either end.\" In the past half month, the People's Liberation Army has taken the initiative to fight everywhere, while Fu Zuoyi has dragged his troops around. He originally used the non-direct line Sixteenth Army and Ninety-Fourth Army to bear the brunt, but instead made his main force, the two divisions of the Thirty-Fifth Army, collapse, with some being annihilated and others being severely damaged. Bandit Fu suffered this disastrous defeat not long after taking office, so he fabricated battle results and boasted wildly, thinking he could cover up his shame, so the rumor company Central News Agency has been shouting desperately in recent days. But the blow that Bandit Fu has suffered this time is only the beginning, and a series of heavy blows will follow one after another.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 大清河北我军展开攻势　接连收复雄县霸县　平保破击战共歼匪七千\n\n1948-01-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　大清河北我军展开攻势\n  　接连收复雄县霸县\n  　平保破击战共歼匪七千\n    【新华社晋察冀前线二十四日电】大清河北我军展开攻势作战。十八日晚再度解放保定东北约九十里之雄县城，歼匪保安大队一部。十九日我军继向东北挺进，当即收复咎岗（雄县东北二十里）、大营（雄县北二十里）、沙口（雄县北四十里）、板家窝（雄县东北三十五里）、开口（新镇西十五里）、牛驼（永清西南二十里）、南孟（霸县北十五里）、岔河集（霸县西十里）、毛尔湾（新镇西南十五里）等村镇。二十一日相继收复霸县。大清河北蒋伪工事被我悉数扫平。详细战果正清查中。现大清河北东至安次、胜芳，西至大清河东岸，北至永定河南岸，南至雄县、新镇之间广大地区，重告解放。\n    【新华社晋察冀前线二十三日电】前线记者评论此次北线大捷称：正当傅作义就任华北“剿共总司令”之际，晋察冀我军便配合东北解放军冬季攻势于新年前后发动以平津保为中心的大规模破击战，继于七八两日我军以一部扫清保定外围据点，直逼保定城郊，傅作义乃急调整三军、九十四军、十六军及三十五军两个师沿平保线西侧南下解围，沿途遭我毙伤四千余人。刚赶到保定喘息未已，北路我军突于十一日黄昏向涞水城发动猛攻，迅速占领四关。傅匪急调三十五军新三十二师、一○一师星夜北援，十二日新三十二师刚进至城东十余里之庄疃及南北义安一线，即被我大军包围，从十二日深夜起，经十六小时激战，新三十二师二千余人全部就歼，师长李铭鼎亦被我击毙。而另路援兵一○一师亦于定兴西北十里之吴村、高洛一带遭我歼俘其六百余人。另由平绥路赶来增援之暂十七师亦在松林店附近被我击毙五百余人，狼狈窜至新城。全役共歼敌七千余人。等到暂三军、十六军、九十四军等部由保定扭转屁股前来增援解围时，战斗早已胜利结束。傅匪“如此高明”的“指挥艺术”，真可谓“武大郎盘杠子两头够不着”。半月来解放军处处主动作战，而傅作义却把部队拖来拖去，他本来是用非嫡系十六军、九十四军来挡头阵，结果反把自己的主力三十五军两个师弄得溃不成军，被歼的被歼，受创的受创。傅匪登台不久，遭此惨败，于是捏造战果大肆吹嘘，以为自己遮羞，因而谣言公司中央社连日来就提高嗓子拼命叫嚣。但傅匪此次所遭打击，还只是开始，一连串沉重的打击，将会接踵而至。"

    "content": "Taiyue News: The Army Region Health Department's hospital work over the past year, under the call of \"develop new therapies and medical service to love soldiers and establish meritorious service movement, achieve 90% of wounds not festering, 50% of new injuries discharged within a month, and fractured bones healed in three months,\" has completed and exceeded the task. On the issue of developing new therapies, the old routine of \"changing dressings every day\" was broken. This old routine had become a habit for both the wounded soldiers and the doctors. If a wounded soldier didn't have their dressing changed for a day, they would scold the doctor for being irresponsible; the doctors also thought it wouldn't work if a wounded soldier's dressing wasn't changed every other day. Later, the hospital promoted new therapies. Education was conducted for the wounded soldiers and all hospital medical staff from the theoretical to the practical effects, opening up everyone's minds, and great achievements were obtained, increasing the number of discharges and expanding the capacity, achieving a new record of rapidly restoring combat effectiveness and reducing the suffering of the wounded and sick. According to the statistics of the past year: new therapies achieved more than 80% of the wounded not festering, in a 300-person capacity clinic, only 60 to 80 people needed dressing changes a day. This saved a lot of manpower and resources, allowed for better care of the wounded soldiers, reduced the pain of the wounded soldiers, and was able to accommodate more wounded and sick. The annual capacity of each clinic has been increased two to three times. The Fourth Field Hospital's capacity in November reached more than three times, and the work was still in good order. The number of new injuries being discharged within one month also reached 50% completely. Because dressings were not changed every day, a lot of materials were saved: for example, the Nineteenth Sub-district directly subordinate clinic, in the past, each wounded soldier used 2.18 chi of powder cloth and 7.1 liang of cotton per day, since the implementation of new therapies, only 1.5 chi of powder cloth and 1.1 liang of cotton are used per month. At the same time, the mortality rate of patients was reduced: 200 old osteomyelitis injuries that could not be cured by Huang Tianbao, Yang Xinting, etc., were all cured within three months; especially more than 100 comrades like Liu Fugui, who had the most difficult-to-treat fracture sores, were also cured and discharged within three months.\n    In nursing work, for the past year, the nurses and staff have taken care of the patients with an extremely kind and patient attitude, feeding them water and meals, helping them with urination and defecation, tidying up the beds, wiping their bodies, washing their feet, preventing bedsores, making mosquito nets, weaving baskets, making brooms, and other work. In the winter, a three-warm movement of warm meals, [unclear], and warm bedding was proposed. For example, nurse Zhang Suogui used heated bricks under the feet of seriously wounded soldiers at night, changing them three times a night, making the wounded soldiers feel very comfortable. Qin Wenzhi fed Han Deqi, who was seriously injured in the head and unconscious, milk four times a day and water twenty times a day, making the wounded soldier regain consciousness within five days and get through the danger period. In order to do the work well even when the tasks were heavy, the nurses also organized three major mutual aid programs: work mutual aid, learning mutual aid, and ideological mutual aid. Clear division of labor, active mutual assistance, carrying out learning in the work, and collectively studying to improve the work.\n    In this situation, the convalescing comrades were also moved. They automatically organized themselves to help the hospital work. For example, Mao Jidu, the leader of the convalescent class of the Fifth Hospital, led ten people to help the hospital deliver boiled water and meals during the day, and sent boiled water to the convalescents in groups at night. The convalescents of the Fourth Field Hospital developed from one \"Love Diligence Class\" to eight \"Love Diligence Classes.\" The wounded and sick soldiers all worked hard to help the hospital with everything they could. Over the past year, the wounded and sick soldiers and staff have encouraged each other, praised each other, and jointly carried out meritorious service, and everyone got along like a family. In particular, the affiliated hospital launched the Zhao Zhiyong learning movement among the convalescents, making the hospital convalescent life school-like, which has achieved many results in improving the political awareness and cultural level of the convalescents.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳卫生部一年的医院工作　使用新疗法有显著成绩\n\n1948-01-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太岳卫生部一年的医院工作\n  　使用新疗法有显著成绩\n    【太岳消息】军区卫生部一年来的医院工作，在“开展新疗法及医务爱兵立功运动、实现百分之九十的创伤不化脓，新伤一月内治疗百分之五十的出院数，三个月治好一个骨折伤”的号召下，完成并超过了任务。在开展新疗法问题上，打破了“天天换药”的老一套治疗法，这一种老一套的办法在伤员与医生中，都成了习惯。伤员一天不换药，就要骂医生不负责；医生也认为伤员隔一天不换药，那还能行？以后医院推行新疗法。从理论到实际效果向伤员和全院医务干部进行教育，打通了大家的思想，获得了很大的成绩，增加了出院数与扩大了收容量，做到了迅速恢复战斗力减少伤病员痛苦的新记录。据去年一年的统计：新疗法达到了百分之八十以上的伤员不化脓，收容三百人的卫生所里，一天只有六十至八十人需要换药。这就节省出很多人力与物力，可以更好的护理伤员，减少伤员的痛苦，并能收容更多的伤病员。全年各所的收容量，有的提高到二倍至三倍。野四所十一月份的收容量达到三倍以上，还是井然有序的工作。新伤一月治疗百分之五十的出院数也完全作到了。由于不每天换药，就大大节省了材料：如十九分区直属所，过去每个伤员每日用粉布二尺一寸八，棉花七两一钱，自施用新疗法后，每月只用粉布一尺五寸，棉花一两一钱。同时减低了病员的伤亡率：黄天保、杨心亭等二百个治不愈的老骨槽伤，三个月内全治好了；特别是刘福贵等百余名，最难治的犯骨折疮的同志三个月内也治愈出院了。\n    在护理工作上，一年来看护员、工作人员都以极亲切的耐心的态度去照护病员，替病员喂水喂饭，接应大小便，整理铺位，擦澡、洗脚，防止褥疮，做蚊帐，编筐子、做扫帚等工作。冬天的时候，又提出暖饭、××、暖被褥的三暖运动。如看护张所桂下夜时，用砖烧热放在重伤员的脚下，一夜换三次，使伤员感到非常舒适，秦文治给头部重伤人事不省的韩德其一天喂四次牛乳，廿次水，五天内使伤员意识清醒，渡过危险期。为了在任务繁重还要把工作做好，看护员又组织了三大互助：就是工作互助，学习互助，思想互助。明确的分工，积极的互相帮助，在工作中开展学习，集体研究改进工作。\n    在这样的情况下，休养员同志也被感动了。他们自动组织起来，帮助医院工作。如五所休养班长毛继度，带领十个人白天帮助病院送开水打饭，晚上分组给休养员送开水。野四所休养员由一个“爱勤班”，发展到八个“爱勤班”。伤病员都努力帮助医院做一切能做的工作。一年来伤病员与工作人员互相慰勉，互相表扬，共同进行了立功，大家和睦得象一个家庭。特别是附属医院，在休养员中，展开了赵志勇学习运动，使医院休养员生活学校化，对提高休养员的政治觉悟与文化水平上，是有不少成绩的。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, 23rd: The people of Shandong have continuously supported the front lines with a high degree of enthusiasm in the past year, helping the People's Liberation Army achieve continuous victories, recording a glorious page in the people's war. At the beginning of the year, during the great victory in Lunan, when the People's Liberation Army annihilated the enemy's First Rapid Column, the 26th Division, and the 51st Division, tens of millions of militiamen cleaned the battlefields, guarded and transported large quantities of American-style cannons, tanks, automobiles and other spoils of war. On the night of the 9th, heavy snow covered the highway, and the next morning the masses cleared the snow, making transportation as convenient as usual. In late February, during the Laiwu Campaign, when seven entire brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits were annihilated, 500,000 militiamen, combat teams, and demolition teams directly served the battlefield. From central Shandong alone, 12,000 stretchers were dispatched. Transportation teams of vehicles and livestock moved day and night through the valleys. In a certain village, two twelve- or thirteen-year-old children climbed over a 700-meter-high mountain in the pitch-black night to guide the army. In a certain place along a tributary of the Wen River, women braved the biting cold wind and lit torches to illuminate the path for the troops. During the Mengshan blocking battle in late April, Gao Huanfu, the leader of the Penglai stretcher team, and Han Mingyang, the deputy leader, resolutely rescued the last two remaining wounded soldiers under the emergency circumstances where the troops and the stretcher team had already withdrawn, carrying them in one breath to the field hospital thirty miles away. When other laborers were transferring the wounded, they used their own rice bowls to hold the wounded's urine and feces along the way, spent money to buy eggs and white sugar for the wounded to eat, sheltered them from wind and rain, drove away flies, and did everything possible to take care of the wounded. In early May, when the 74th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits was annihilated at Menglianggu, hundreds of thousands of laborers went through all kinds of hardships and overcame various obstacles, everyone considering it a great honor to participate in this victory. At that time, the Wu Ma grain transportation team from Jiaonan County encountered high mountains and dangerous gorges, and automatically took off their clothes to wrap the grain. Each person carried fifty or sixty catties of grain, crossed dozens of miles of bumpy and difficult mountain roads, and then put it on carts to push, thus transporting the grain to the front in a timely manner. During the rainy season in July, the Juxian County South army-following transportation team pushed and pulled carts loaded with ammunition, battling the foot-deep mud and many large rivers on the road, covering the ammunition boxes with raincoats while getting wet themselves, and successfully completed each mission. When the Chen-Su army shifted to the outer lines for counter-offensive, a large number of laborers followed the army on its expedition.\n\n　　In addition, a large number of laborers followed the Xu-Tan army, actively participating in the front lines of Jiaodong. As for the rear and the masses in the war zone, they grinded grain, baked pancakes, made military shoes, and sewed military uniforms for the front day and night. Many women and children also actively shouldered the heavy task of supporting the front in the rear. In the heroic and arduous support work, the political awareness of the participating laborers was further enhanced. The Juxian County South participating masses, who were honored as the \"Steel Transportation Team,\" had 700 members gloriously join the Communist Party, and a large number of other members joined the New Democratic Youth League.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 山东民工支援前线一年功绩伟大　帮助解放军连续获胜\n\n1948-01-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　山东民工支援前线一年功绩伟大\n  　帮助解放军连续获胜\n    【新华社华东二十三日电】山东人民在过去一年内不断以高度的积极性支援前线，帮助解放军连续获得胜利，记录下人民战争的伟大一页。年初鲁南大捷，解放军歼灭敌第一快速纵队、整廿六师和五十一师时，成千万民兵打扫战场，看守和搬运大批得美式大炮、坦克、汽车等胜利品。九日夜间大雪埋住公路，第二天一早群众就把积雪打扫干净，使交通运输便利如常。二月下旬莱芜战役，歼灭蒋匪七个整旅时，五十万民兵参战队、爆炸队等直接服务战地，仅鲁中即出动担架一万二千付。运输队的车辆、牲口浩浩荡荡地日夜流动山谷。某村两个十二、三岁的儿童漆黑夜爬过七百多公尺高的山岭给军队带路。汶水支流某地妇女冒着刺骨的冷风，点起火把给队伍照亮。四月下旬蒙山阻击战中，蓬莱担架队分队长高焕富、小队长韩明扬，在部队和担架队都已撤走的紧急情况下，仍坚决地抢救最后留下的两名伤员，一口气背到三十里外的野战医院。其他民工们在转运伤员时，一路上拿自己的饭瓢给伤员盛大小便，出钱买鸡蛋、白糖给伤员吃，遮风雨、赶苍蝇，用尽一切办法照顾伤员。五月上旬孟良崮歼灭蒋匪七十四师时，几十万民工历尽千辛万苦，克服各种险阻，大家都以能参加这次胜仗为极大光荣。当时胶（县）南吴马运粮队碰到高山险峡，自动脱下衣服包装粮食，每人背粮食五、六十斤，翻过几十里凹凸难走的山路，然后再放上小车推送，这样轮番转运，终于将粮食及时送到前方。七月雨季，莒（县）南随军担运队推拉着装满弹药的小车，跟公路上尺把深的烂泥和许多条大水博斗，拿蓑衣盖弹药箱，自己淋雨，每次任务都胜利完成。当陈粟大军转入外线反攻时，大批民工随军出征。\n    另有大批民工则随许谭大军活跃胶东前线。至于后方及战地群众日夜为前方磨粮食、烙煎饼、做军鞋、缝军衣，许多妇女儿童也都积极担负了后方繁重的支前任务。在英勇艰苦的支援工作中，参战民工的政治觉悟更提高了，荣获“钢铁担运队”的莒（县）南参战群众，已有七百名队员光荣地加入了共产党，另有大批队员参加新民主主义青年团。"

In Cologne (British zone), a major industrial city in Germany, 120,000 workers announced a 24-hour general strike on the 21st. The steel, hardware, chemical, and construction industries have all fallen silent, and government offices and most shops have closed one after another. Strikes in many cities in the Ruhr area are continuing. Two thousand construction workers in Essen went on strike on the 20th. The factory trade union committees of Bochum and Gelsenkirchen decided that if the food problem is not resolved before February 1st, they will announce a strike by Ruhr miners. All employees in the British occupied zone have also announced a general strike, demanding an increase in rations. In the American occupied zone, 70,000 workers in Nuremberg held a strike to protest the serious food situation. 50,000 striking workers participated in demonstrations and held a general meeting. In Bibra, 9,000 workers went on strike. More than 2,000 workers in Wiesbaden-Bubach went on strike, protesting the halving of fat rations. The chairman of the trade union in Gavel (southern part of the American occupied zone) stated that the area faces the threat of a strike by 65,000 workers, and a slight touch could create a situation like that in the Ruhr. Barker, the trade union leader of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, recently issued a warning stating: \"If the hungry food situation is not improved, a new wave of strikes in the Ruhr can be foreseen soon. If the crisis deepens, it is expected that hungry people will begin to attack farms, food, and bakeries.\" German democratic newspapers such as Deutsche Nachrichten pointed out: The serious difficulties of the working class in the US-British joint occupation zone have reached an unbearable limit. Terms such as \"food disaster\" are no longer suitable to describe the current situation. The current strikes in the joint occupation zone are a powerful expression of anti-hunger and self-defense.\n　　\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Washington dispatch: Due to high prices and difficult living conditions, the United States is brewing a wage increase and general strike movement. The Railroad Operating Engineers Union, with 125,000 members, is scheduled to begin a strike on February 1st. The United Auto Workers Union of the CIO, with 800,000 members, has notified employers of its wage increase demands, and 233,000 telephone workers will also make wage increase demands. Also, six thousand workers at the American \"Equatorial Petroleum Company\" in Colombia have been on strike for many days. The workers unanimously oppose the dismissal of workers and demand wage increases.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Lima, Peru dispatch: The American Federation of Labor (AFL)'s attempt to sabotage the progressive Latin American Labor Federation led by Toledano by convening the so-called \"Pan-American Labor Conference\" has been exposed and has failed. The chairman of the Mexican Local Labor League, Morones, spoke at the conference, accusing the purpose of the AFL's convening of the conference as serving American monopoly capital, and angrily withdrew from the meeting. Many Latin American labor organizations and well-known major newspapers have resolutely attacked the \"conference\" and ignored its activities. In a letter to the Peruvian Minister of Labor, the chairman of the AFL also lamented that \"the failure of the conference may make the AFL a laughingstock.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 工人生活困难不能再忍受　德罢工运动猛烈展开　美国工人也正预备大罢工\n\n1948-01-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　工人生活困难不能再忍受\n  　德罢工运动猛烈展开\n  　美国工人也正预备大罢工\n    【新华社陕北二十四日电】柏林讯：德境英美占领区反饥饿运动更趋高涨。德国大工业城市科隆（英占区）十二万工人于二十一日宣布二十四小时总罢工，钢铁、五金、化学和建筑各业均已寂然无声，市府机关和绝大多数店铺相继关门。鲁尔区很多城市的罢工仍在继续。埃森二千名建筑工人于二十日进行罢工。巴木及该尔孙基亨的工厂工会委员会，决定如粮食问题在二月一日前不能解决，将宣布鲁尔矿工罢工。英占区所有职员亦已宣布总罢工，要求增加配给量。在美占区，努连堡七万工人举行罢工，反对严重的粮食情况。五万罢工工人参加示威并开大会，拜布拉赫有九千名工人罢工。威斯巴登——布巴黑二千余工人罢工，抗议脂肪配给量减少一半。加维尔市（美占区南）工会主席称：该地面临六万五千工人罢工之威胁，只要轻轻触一下，就会造成象鲁尔那样的情况。德北莱茵威斯特发利亚州的职工会领袖巴克勒，顷发出警告称：“如果饥饿的粮食情况不加以改善的话，不久，可以预见鲁尔新罢工的浪潮。假如危机加深的话，可以预料饥饿的人群将开始进攻农场、食品及面包店。”德国民主报纸德意志新闻等指出：美英联合占领区工人阶级的严重困难，已到了不能忍受的限度。象粮食灾难这样的名词，已不再适于形容目前的情况了。目前联合占领区所进行的罢工，是反饥饿及实行自卫的有力表示。\n    【新华社陕北二十三日电】华盛顿讯：由于物价高涨，生活困难，美国正酝酿增资与大罢工运动。拥有十二万五千会员的铁道机务工人工会，定于二月一日开始罢工。拥有八十万会员的产联汽车工人联合会，已将增资要求通知各雇主，二十三万三千电话工人亦将提出增资要求。又讯：美国在哥伦比亚的“赤道石油公司”六千工人，已罢工多日，工人一致反对解雇工人并要求增资。\n    【新华社陕北二十四日电】秘鲁首都里马讯：美国劳联于日前召开所谓“泛美劳工会议”，以破坏托列达诺所领导的进步的拉丁美洲劳工联盟的企图，已被戳穿则告失败。墨西哥地方劳工联盟主席莫洛尼斯在该会议上发言时，控诉美国劳联召开会议的目的，是为美国独占资本服务，并愤而退出会场。许多拉丁美洲的劳工团体与著名大报，都坚决地攻击该“会议”，并不理睬其活动。劳联主席在致秘鲁劳工部长的信中，亦哀鸣“会议的失败，可能使劳联成为一个最大的笑柄。”"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-26",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th: Various regions in East China have overcome the devastation caused by Chiang Kai-shek's forces amidst the war and have universally launched winter production and savings-for-famine-preparedness campaigns, achieving significant results. According to statistics from ten counties in central Shandong, Chiang's bandits looted 14,000 head of livestock, and ten districts were robbed of over 21.8 million jin of grain. To address the winter production difficulties faced by disaster victims, the democratic government first issued large amounts of loans and organized mass production and savings campaigns. Simultaneously, it implemented strict streamlining, cleared out materials, and reduced expenditures to alleviate the people's burden. The central Shandong region has already received a total of 800 million yuan (Beihai currency) in loans and materials from the provincial government, the central Shandong Administrative Office, and the Industry and Commerce Bureau. In addition, a large amount of cotton was lent to develop the textile industry. In Jiaonan County of Jiaodong, in addition to loans of 40 million yuan, 110,000 jin of peanuts were used to support sideline industries such as oil pressing. The Binhai area also issued loans of 100 million yuan. In northern Jiangsu, Lian (shui) East County alone lent out 300,000 jin of wheat seeds. Regarding the resolution of labor shortages, the provincial government has decided to change the system of standing civilian laborers supporting the front to a system of short-term piecework supporting the front on the spot. A large number of civilian laborers who had accompanied the army on expeditions have been demobilized, with 100,000 returning home to production in the Bohai region. Many cadres from government offices and local troops have used significant manpower and livestock power to help the masses cultivate the land. In Yeting and Jianyang (newly established county) in northern Jiangsu, farmers collectively mobilized, and wherever the flags were planted, the wasteland was eliminated. In Yongdun Township, Funing East, over 8,000 mu of idle land in the entire township were cultivated in five days. In the border areas, armed forces provided cover for the masses to seize and cultivate land.\n\nRegarding sideline production: Since its establishment two months ago, the Binhai Transportation and Marketing Headquarters has transported and sold an average of 600,000 jin of salt per day. The various stations have organized a total of 270 bullock carts and handcarts, and 553 pack donkeys. The masses have greatly profited from transportation. The 100 handcarts organized by the headquarters alone earned 7 million yuan by contracting to transport yellow tobacco for the Binhai Tobacco Company. Most transportation teams have managed to transport fish, salt, and brine outward and grain and raw materials inward, storing them for famine preparedness. It is estimated that Binhai can transport 20 million jin of salt this winter. Thanks to the strong assistance of cooperatives, most of the 400,000 spinning wheels and 23,000 looms in the Binhai region have been put into operation, with hundreds of thousands of female spinners engaged in winter textile production. In October alone, more than 25,000 bolts of cloth were produced. Textile production has also been universally launched in various parts of Bohai, with female spinners in three joint defense villages in Guangrao earning over 8 million yuan in half a month. In terms of savings, various government offices are strictly implementing the \"Three Major Programs\" (streamlining, savings, and clearing assets). Many government offices in central Shandong are even grinding their own grain. Post office staff saved salaries and grain, and the three counties of Mengshan, etc., contributed 8,000 jin of grain. Various localities have also universally prohibited the slaughter of draught cattle, the brewing of wine, and various wasteful phenomena. The East China Field Army's eastern front troops launched donation campaigns to help people in disaster areas restore production. A certain column donated 6 million yuan and some clothing, while the directly subordinate units donated 1 million yuan and 2,600 jin of grain. A certain regiment in Binhai also donated over 43,000 yuan, 1,800 jin of grain, and some clothing and bedding.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 政府发贷款农副业一齐干　华东开展冬季生产\n\n1948-01-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　政府发贷款农副业一齐干\n  　华东开展冬季生产\n    【新华社华东二十四日电】华东各地在战争环境中战胜蒋灾，普遍开展冬季生产与节约备荒运动，成绩很大。鲁中十个县统计，就被蒋匪抢去牲口一万四千头，十个区就被抢去粮食二千一百八十余万斤。民主政府为解决灾民冬季生产困难，首先是发放大批贷款，组织群众生产节约运动，一面并厉行精简，清理物资，减缩开支，以减轻人民负担。鲁中区已由省府、鲁中行署和工商局发放贷款和物资共八亿元（北海币），另贷放大批棉花发展纺织。胶东胶（县）南县除贷款四千万元外，并以十一万斤花生扶助打油等副业。滨海亦发放一亿元贷款。苏北仅涟（水）东一县即贷出三十万斤麦种。对解决人力问题，省府已经决定将支前常备民工制改为就地支前的短工包工制，随军远征的民工已大批复员，渤海区就有十万人回家生产。有不少机关人员和地方部队，曾以大量人力、畜力帮助群众耕种。苏北叶挺和建阳（新设县）等地农民集体出动，旗子插到哪里，哪里的荒地就被消灭。阜（宁）东永墩乡五天中就耕完全乡八千多亩闲地。边沿区则由武装掩护群众抢耕。\n    副业方面：滨海运销总站成立两月以来，平均每天运销食盐六十万斤，各站已组织起牛车、小车共二百七十辆、驮驴五五三头。群众在运输中获利很大，仅总站所组织的一百辆小车，给滨海烟草公司包运黄烟就获利七百万元。大部运输队都做到了向外运出鱼、盐、卤等类，向内运回粮食、原料等，储存储荒。预计滨海今冬可运出食盐两千万斤。由于合作社大力帮助，滨海全区四十万辆纺车、两万三千架织布机已大部开动，几十万纺妇投入冬季纺织，仅十月份即产布二万五千余匹。渤海各地也普遍开展了纺织，广饶三个联防村纺妇半月即获利八百余万元。在节约方面，各机关正厉行“三大方案”（精简、节约、清理资财）。鲁中不少机关更自磨粮食。邮局人员节约薪金、粮食，蒙山等三县即献粮八千多斤。各地并普遍禁杀耕牛、禁酿酒及各种浪费现象。华东解放军东线兵团各部掀起捐款运动，帮助遭蒋灾人民生产，某纵队捐款达六百万元，及衣服一部，直属队献金一百万元及粮食二千六百斤。滨海某团亦捐助四万三千余元、粮食一千八百余斤，及衣被一部。"

    "title": "Village Cadres Monopolize Loans for Speculation and Report False Achievements; Pretend to Care for Poor Laborers, Harming Middle Peasants; Major Problems in Winter Production in Some Areas of Taihang",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-26",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "【Taihang News】Poor laborers want to engage in winter production but lack capital. In some areas of Taihang, major problems have emerged in the emphasis on fully resolving this difficulty. Some village cadres are harming the interests of middle peasants, feigning \"assistance\" to poor laborers, and profiting from it themselves. Generally speaking, they use two methods: The first is to give poor laborers \"empty shares\" (completely copying the old methods of landlords and despots entering \"heroic shares\"). For example, Shexian First District, Shentou Village, proposed the slogan \"Middle peasants should help poor laborers.\" The Qian Yueyi mutual aid team held a meeting to \"mobilize\" nine middle peasant households to give poor laborers empty shares. They even solemnly criticized the middle peasants, saying that their past claims of caring for poor laborers were false (last autumn, this team stipulated: for outside sideline work, middle peasants received three jin of rice per work day, while poor laborers received four jin of rice, but because the middle peasants were dissatisfied and resisted, and because the cadres were originally insincere, it was never implemented). They emphatically proposed (actually, they forced): This time, we must truly \"care\" for them. Subsequently, the nine middle peasant households were forced to say: \"Our team actually invested 180,000 yuan (140,000 yuan from nine middle peasant households, 40,000 yuan from eight poor laborer households), and we will distribute dividends based on 240,000 yuan. The dividends from the 60,000 yuan of empty shares will be considered as care for the eight poor laborer households. Because we middle and poor peasants are one family!\" Guo Qinglong's team also decided that a poor laborer household would enter 10,000 yuan of empty shares. This is called \"middle peasants lending capital, poor laborers sharing dividends.\" More seriously, in Huyukou Village, First District of Shexian County, after five dark nights of \"working on\" the middle peasants' thinking, they \"obtained\" the middle peasants' \"consciousness\" and \"willingness\" and decided on a method to \"take care of\" the poor laborers. The Tonghe mutual aid team's method was: \"Each time dividends are distributed (three times a year), middle peasants must 'voluntarily' give 10,000 yuan of dividends to take care of the disabled poor laborers in the team; they must also provide 900 jin of firewood per year to take care of the poor laborers without labor; poor peasants with no or little shares will also share dividends like middle peasants.\" The actions of cadres in Shentou and Huyukou Villages, who took it upon themselves to harm the interests of middle peasants to \"help\" poor laborers, also occurred in Xialing in Pinging County and Yangyu in Neiqiu County. They all gave poor laborers empty shares. The second method is to \"mobilize\" (actually, force) middle peasants to lend money to poor laborers indefinitely and without any compensation. For example, after five dark nights of \"working on\" the middle peasants' thinking in Huyukou Village, Shexian County, the Gonghe mutual aid team forcibly \"mobilized\" middle peasants like Liu Jiaxun to lend 190,000 yuan and 42 work days to the poorest peasants as shares. This practice has been very common in many villages in counties such as Zuoquan. This will inevitably lead to serious consequences, which is harming the interests of middle peasants, undermining the unity of poor and middle peasants, and ultimately isolating the poor laborers. At the same time, it undermines the policy of equal exchange in production mutual aid, and as a result, will break up the mutual assistance production of poor and middle peasants. The main reasons for doing so can be found in the following two situations: One is the purely speculative thinking of village cadres, in order to report achievements upwards and show that they are actively \"helping the poor laborers\"; the other is that village cadres want to cover up their monopoly of loans and over-occupation of fruits. In any case, it actually harms the real interests of poor laborers. For example, cadres in Xialing, Pinging County, kept 547,200 yuan of loans and did not distribute them in the cooperative. They said it was for centrally supporting poor laborers in weaving, but instead they gave poor laborers empty shares. This is clearly not really for the sake of poor laborers. At the same time, in terms of leadership, some places have also unconsciously approved the above-mentioned erroneous actions. They are blinded by narrow class views or blindly believe in their subordinates and make mistakes.

    "content": "Taihang News: The Zuoquan United Stone Printing Factory has successfully experimented with using calendered paper to replace chemographic paper. There are three differences in the usage method compared to chemographic paper: (1) When writing, the lithographic ink should be slightly thicker than when writing on chemographic paper. (2) When putting it on the printing stone, use more water than with chemographic paper. Because calendered paper has no viscosity, but also absorbs ink, it is not afraid of blurred writing even with more water. (3) The pressing time, the first time should be more than ten minutes, and then when pressing again, about a quarter of an hour, the writing can be pressed on. When applying water the second time, be careful not to lift the base paper when removing the lead sheet, the water should be applied to the paper pasted on the printing stone, to avoid the base paper moving and being damaged. This invention was researched by the factory many times. First, they tried coating a layer of peach gum on glossy paper, but it was not successful. Later, \"kraft paper\" was also unsuccessful. Using glossy calendered paper was the result of the final experiment. After the experiment was successful, the factory printed a thousand copies of share account books using glossy calendered paper for the first time, and the quality was the same as that printed with chemographic paper. Now, except for printing fine work that requires chemographic paper, they use glossy calendered paper for general rough work. This not only saves money, but also greatly overcomes the difficulty of obtaining chemographic paper.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 用粉连纸代替药纸　左权石印厂试验成功\n\n1948-01-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　用粉连纸代替药纸\n  　左权石印厂试验成功\n    【太行消息】左权联合石印厂，用油光粉连纸代替药纸的实验已经成功。使用办法与药纸有三点不同：（一）写字时候，药墨比往药纸上写要浓一些。（二）上版时候，用水要比药纸大一些，因为油光粉连纸无粘性，但本身也吃墨，水大也不怕字迹模糊。（三）压的时间，第一次要在十分钟以上，再压时，用一刻钟左右，字就可压上；二次上水，掀铅皮注意不要连底版带起，水要上到贴版纸上，避免底版纸移动拉坏。这个发明曾经过该厂多次研究，先是用油光纸涂上一层桃胶，没有成功。后又用“牛皮纸”亦未成功。用油光粉连纸是最后试验的结果。在试验成功后，该厂第一次用油光粉连纸印股金帐，一下就印了一千多份，质量和药纸印的一样。现在他们除印细活用药纸外，一般粗活都用油光粉连纸。不但节省了经济，并大大克服了药纸来源困难。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 24th: Late-breaking news: On January 1st, Shijiazhuang Democratic Government Mayor Ke Qingshi elaborated in detail on the democratic government's determination to build Shijiazhuang City at a symposium with people from all walks of life in Shijiazhuang. Mayor Ke first explained to the attendees that the construction of Shijiazhuang is a set policy of the democratic government. This is because after the liberation of Shijiazhuang, it is no longer a war fortification or isolated island under the rule of bandits and puppets. Now, Shijiazhuang is integrated with the vast towns and villages of the liberated areas. Regarding the issue of protecting national industry and commerce, Mayor Ke emphasized that protecting and developing industry and commerce in the city and carrying out land reform and eliminating feudalism in the countryside are two different things and two different policies. The \"Land Law Outline of China\" and the \"Manifesto of the Chinese People's Liberation Army\" both have clear stipulations. In the future, the main task of state-owned stores will be to guarantee supply and stabilize prices, not to eliminate private industry and commerce. Regarding the protection of legitimate industry and commerce, Mayor Ke explained that the democratic municipal government has done the following major work: (1) The trade company has transported a large number of daily necessities, ensuring the needs of the citizens. (2) The bank has set reasonable exchange rates for exchanging KMT currency, and at the same time, prohibited the transaction of raw gold and silver, stabilizing the financial market and causing prices to drop sharply. (3) The phenomenon of some outsiders rushing to purchase materials has been prohibited, and KMT bandits who robbed stores have been punished. (4) Exorbitant taxes and levies have been abolished, and reasonable burdens have been implemented, reducing the burden on the people and industry and commerce. Regarding the resettlement of unemployed workers, Mayor Ke said: Those who can resume work should be assisted in resuming work as much as possible. For those who cannot resume work, the government will take the following measures: (1) Those whose homes are in the liberated areas will be called upon to return home to divide land and divide spoils. (2) Change careers. (3) Establish technical schools. Finally, Mayor Ke emphasized the issue of the construction of the democratic regime in Shijiazhuang, saying: Today's government is a democratic coalition government, not a dictatorship of the proletariat, nor a dictatorship of the peasants, but a local coalition government of a broad united front composed of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants from all walks of life.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 石家庄柯市长谈建设方针　保护发展工商业  安置好失业工人\n\n1948-01-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　石家庄柯市长谈建设方针\n  　保护发展工商业\n    安置好失业工人\n    【新华社晋察冀二十四日电】迟到消息：一月一日石家庄民主市政府柯庆施市长，于石市各界座谈会上，对民主政府决心建设石家庄市方针阐述颇详。柯氏首向与会各界人士说明建设石家庄乃是民主政府既定方针。这是由于石市解放后，已非匪伪统治时期的内战碉堡或孤岛，现时石市业与解放区广大城镇乡村结合起来。关于保护民族工商业问题，柯市长着重说明，在城市里保护和发展工商业，和农村实行土地改革、消灭封建是两件事，两个政策。中国土地法大纲及解放军宣言均有明文规定。今后公营商店主要任务乃为保证供给，平抑物价，而不是消灭私人工商业。关于保护正当工商业方面，柯市长说明民主市政府已做了如下主要工作：（一）贸易公司运来大批日用物资，保证了市民的需要。（二）银行规定了合理的牌价，兑换蒋币，同时禁止生金银交易，稳定了金融市场，使物价急剧下降。（三）禁止了某些外来人员抢购物资的现象，惩办了抢劫商店的蒋家匪徒。（四）废除了苛捐杂税与摊派制度，实行合理负担，减轻人民与工商业负担。关于安置失业工人，柯市长说：能复工者当尽量设法协助复工。不能复工者，政府将采取以下措施：（一）家在解放区者，号召其回家分土地分浮财。（二）转业。（三）开办技工学校。最后柯市长着重谈及石市民主政权建设问题时说：今天的政府是民主联合政府，不是无产阶级专政，也不是农民专政，而是工、农、兵、学、商各界组成的广泛统一战线的地方性的联合政府。"

    "content": "[Xiyang News] After a recent inspection of winter loans in this county, it was proven that some villages used correct methods to directly lend to the poor and employed, which played a significant role. However, some village cadres arbitrarily distributed the loans, and the difficulties of the poor and employed were not resolved. When Dingyu Village in the Seventh District issued winter loans, they first held a symposium for the poor and employed, discussing past hardships, calculating family assets, understanding the disaster, and formulating winter production plans. For example, the poor and employed Wang Lianhe (an old man) is a good household. The family of three cultivated 7.7 mu of sloping land, harvested three dan of grain last year, and ate an average of 4.5 dou (small dou) of coarse and fine grains per month. They paid 50 jin of burden grain and spent 4 small dou of rice to buy two houses. Now, they only have 2 shi of miscellaneous grains left, which they plan to eat for five months (from November to the end of March). In addition, they planted one mu of wheat, which is estimated to yield one small shi, enough to supplement two and a half months of food, leaving a shortage of one and a half months until the end of July. Based on this calculation, they formulated a production plan: carrying charcoal to Zanhuang, each trip can carry 110 jin, earning 30 yuan per jin, totaling 3,300 yuan. Buying grain on the return trip, they can carry 6 dou, earning 3,600 yuan. The round trip will earn a total of 6,900 yuan. After deducting expenses of 1,600 yuan for the four-day round trip, the net profit is 5,300 yuan. However, they had difficulty with the initial capital, so they borrowed 20,000 yuan. They plan to carry charcoal and sell grain in the winter and the first month of the new year, and with the money earned, in addition to supplementing food, they guarantee to buy a donkey. Also, the poor and employed Gao Sanyin and Yao Wenhua jointly borrowed 30,000 yuan. They rely on the mountains for a living and jointly collect crow plums, having already collected 20 jin, which can be sold for 200 yuan per jin. They also chop cypress branches, planning to chop 30,000 jin in three months, which can produce 300 jin of cypress oil, selling for 500 yuan per jin, totaling 150,000 yuan. After calculation, everyone formulated a production plan. All 400,000 yuan of loans in the village were lent to the poor and employed in a timely manner. Now, they have already bought three donkeys. The 400,000 yuan loan in Nanying Village was also lent to the poor and employed in this way, with plans to increase livestock by 13 heads, of which seven have already been purchased. The second type is the wrong method. Village cadres in Nanyetou Village, regardless of the needs of the masses, used the loans to buy four donkeys and distributed them to the masses, but no one dared to take them. To this day, the livestock are still idle, and the difficulties of the poor and employed have not been resolved. The 230,000 yuan loan in Shangguozhuang Village was distributed to 12 households, and the cadres assigned specific people to manage production, with the lending households and cadres splitting the profits at a two-eight ratio; if money was lost, the lending households were not responsible. The lending households are not satisfied with this method, nor has it met the requirements of the lending households.

Comprehensive reports: Western European public opinion continues to condemn the Marshall Plan, believing that the United States is attempting to exchange the enslavement of various countries at a cheap price. British Communist leader Pollitt said on the 18th: \"The supporters of the Marshall Plan never talk about what situation Britain will be in once the plan fails, and the Marshall Plan will fail when the American economic crisis develops.\" The British \"Truth\" weekly believes: \"The final decision of this plan will include various conditions restricting the sovereignty of the assisted countries. If 'aid' from the United States is accepted, Britain will be in a sad state of dependence on the United States.\" The reactionary Conservative Party's \"Daily Express\" also said disappointedly and fearfully on the 17th: \"The United States wants to control Britain's foreign policy, tariff policy, monetary policy, and finally Britain's trade policy. These constitute an unprecedented infringement on British sovereignty.\" \"The British people are unwilling to sell their financial independence in exchange for cigarettes, prunes, and egg powder under the Marshall Plan.\" The \"Times\" also worried that \"American aid will prove to be of no avail.\" \"Various Swedish newspapers published materials on the quantity and nature of the U.S. supplies to Sweden, arousing fierce criticism from all walks of life, including businessmen\" (TASS). \"Forvioan\" wrote: \"In order to trade with the United States, we must participate in the European group under the guidance of the United States. We will not even be able to buy the goods we urgently need but the United States does not have. On the contrary, we are forced to damage our industry and buy what the Americans are willing to sell us.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-26",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, January 24th:\n\n　　Wang Shaoqi, Chiang Kai-shek bandit Northeast Military Control Bureau No. 134 special agent, who voluntarily confessed at the anti-Chiang Kai-shek meeting of the Harbin Liberated Military Officers Corps last December, recently published an article titled \"My Confession\" in the \"Liberated Armyman\" column of the Northeast Daily here, painfully recounting his various counter-revolutionary crimes in the past. The article first states that he is from Zhuoxian County, Hebei Province, and studied at Luhe Middle School in Tongxian County. In 1944, he formally joined the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Military Control Bureau special agent organization. After Japan surrendered, he was sent to Shenyang and Jinzhou to carry out activities. He described his crimes of infiltrating our army, saying: \"I took the opportunity to disguise myself and infiltrate the Democratic Allied Army. In Zhangwu and Fuxin, I also bought off two lackeys, Yang Hangzhou and Pei Zhenwu. We secretly carried out various reactionary propaganda in the army. Later, the political commissar discovered that I often liked to talk strangely behind people's backs and sent me to the military region's training team to study. However, he still didn't know I was a special agent. When I left, he said to me: Your thinking is relatively backward, you must study hard.\n　　After I arrived at the training team, I continued to carry out activities, and I also met a Kuomintang Youth League special agent, Liu Yating. The two of us then cooperated, often eavesdropping on cadres' meetings and stealing important documents, such as the unit's work plan and the bi-weekly passwords.\n　　Once, Liu Yating colluded with the bandit leader Zhang Tongxuan (whom Chiang Kai-shek had appointed as a military commander) to attack the Democratic Allied Army, and we prepared to act as internal support. However, the bandit Hu was ambushed by the Democratic Allied Army on the way and was completely annihilated, so our plan failed. After that, Liu Yating tried to assassinate the political commissar but was caught. Because I was afraid of being implicated, I disguised myself and secretly deserted, fleeing the liberated area.\"\n　　In May 1946, after he fled to Jinzhou, he was sent to Shenyang for training. In Shenyang, he was ordered to use American poison to assassinate a democratic person named Chen in a restaurant. After the murder, he also said that this person died in the restaurant from \"cholera\" and had the police seal off the restaurant. He described the situation in Shenyang where he was ordered to suppress workers' demands for wage increases and carry out shameless anti-Soviet conspiracies: \"In June, workers at the Tiexi Automobile Factory in Shenyang demanded a wage increase. The factory director reported to the (Chiang Kai-shek) commander's office, saying that there were Communist activities among the workers. I and Nos. 137 and 138 workers were sent to investigate. We sneaked into the factory and investigated for a few days without any clues. In order to complete our mission, we fired a few shots one night when people weren't prepared. The workers panicked and ran out, so we falsely accused the workers of attempting to riot and arrested nineteen workers and sent them to the (Chiang Kai-shek) commander's office. Later, I heard that they were dealt with as Communists.\n　　In Shenyang, the Military Control Bureau also carried out conspiracies to sabotage Sino-Soviet relations, deliberately fabricating facts, spreading rumors, and sowing discord. Once, I and Nos. 137 and 132 followed a Soviet person and walked near Peace Park. Seeing that person whispering with another person, we thought their actions were suspicious and immediately pounced on them. It turned out that the hair was dyed and the big nose was also fake. After repeated questioning, we realized that it was also a special agent from the Military Control Bureau, specializing in disguising themselves as Soviet people, doing many bad things, and using this to sabotage Sino-Soviet relations. The next day, the newspaper published a news item in large headlines: Soviet spies were active near Peace Park, attempting to assassinate a senior official of ours, fortunately discovered by our detective team, and finally captured after a fierce fight.\"\n　　In the autumn of the same year, he was transferred to the Provisional Third Division and sent to Zhangwu to recruit new soldiers, colluding with bandit Hu to sabotage the Inner Mongolia People's Self-Defense Army and frame our democratic government county and district cadres. A district political commissar was once captured by him and sent to the Shenyang concentration camp. County Magistrate Fan of Lubei (newly established county north of Rehe Kailu) was also ambushed and captured by him, but later rescued by the People's Liberation Army. The Northeast Chiang Kai-shek military authorities, in order to cover up their military failures, carried out deceptive propaganda and forced the captured recruits to admit that they were captured Democratic Allied Army soldiers. He wrote: \"The Shenyang (Chiang Kai-shek) commander's office constantly falsely reported to Nanjing that it had captured hundreds or thousands of Eighth Route Army soldiers. Before the (Chiang Kai-shek) Ministry of National Defense sent people to inspect, the (Chiang Kai-shek) commander's office sent people to the new recruits and said: Do you want to wear American military uniforms? Do you want to eat white rice and flour? When the inspection commissioners come, as long as you admit that you are Eighth Route Army prisoners, everything can be solved. These new recruits are like prisoners, how dare they say no? When the inspection commissioners arrived, the new recruits lined up and shouted: We are defectors! We were captured! The three fake prisoner-of-war units were later reorganized into the Youth Training Corps by the (Chiang Kai-shek) Ministry of National Defense. These new recruits had two numbers, belonging to the Provisional Third Division and the Training Corps at the same time. They made two sets of rosters every month and received two sets of salaries. But these new recruits still couldn't wear or eat well, and they couldn't get either salary.\"\n　　Wang Shaoqi deeply hates his past counter-revolutionary crimes of slaughtering the people. At the end of his article, he said: \"I have done so many evil things, and now I think I deserve to die. But I never thought that I would be lucky enough to be rescued by the Democratic Allied Army, and they educated me and made me realize my past sins.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋匪东北军统局特务　王少奇自供他干的坏事\n\n1948-01-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋匪东北军统局特务\n  　王少奇自供他干的坏事\n    【新华社东北二十四日电】年前十二月曾在哈尔滨解放军官团反蒋大会上自动坦白的蒋匪东北军统局第一三四号特务王少奇，顷在此间东北日报“解放军人”栏，发表“我的自白”一文，痛述其从前反革命种种罪行。该文首述其为河北涿县人，曾在通县潞河中学读书，一九四四年正式参加蒋匪军统局特务组织。日本投降后，被派赴沈阳、锦州一带活动。他叙述其渗入我军种种罪行称：“我乘机伪装渗入民主联军，在彰武、阜新一带，我又收买了杨航舟、裴振武两个腿子。我们在部队里秘密进行各种反动的宣传，过后政委发觉我经常喜欢背人讲怪话，把我送到军区教导队去学习。但他还不知我是特务，临走时还对我说：你的思想比较落后，要好好的学习。\n    我到了教导队后依然进行活动，并且我又认识了一个三青团的特务刘亚亭。我们两个便合作一起，时常窃听干部开会和偷盗重要文件，如部队工作计划和半月的口令等，都偷出来过。\n    有一次，刘亚亭勾结匪首张桐轩（蒋匪曾委为军长）来袭击民主联军，我们准备作内应。但胡匪在半路遭民主联军伏击，整个被歼，因此我们的计划流产了。此后刘亚亭谋刺政委不成被捉，我因为怕牵连，就化装偷偷的开了小差，逃出解放区。”\n    一九四六年五月他逃到锦州后，又被派往沈阳受训。他在沈阳奉命以美国毒药，在饭馆暗杀了一个陈姓的民主人士，害了以后还说此人系在饭馆“患虎烈拉”而死，让警察封闭了那家饭馆。他叙述在沈阳受命镇压工人增资要求及进行无耻反苏阴谋情形称：“六月间，沈阳铁西汽车工厂工人要求增加工资，厂长报告（蒋匪）长官部，说工人里面有共产党活动。我和一三七、一三八号等工人被派去调查。我们混进工厂查了几天毫无头绪。我们为了交代公事，就在一个夜里乘人不备打了几枪。工人们惊慌地跑出来，于是我们诬陷工人企图暴动，便捉了十九个工人送到（蒋匪）长官部，后来听说把他们当作共产党办了。\n    在沈阳，军统局还进行破坏中苏邦交的阴谋，故意虚构事实，散布谣言，挑拨是非。有一次，我和一三七、一三二号，跟踪一个苏联人，走到和平公园附近，见那人与另外一人窃窃私语。我们以为行踪可疑，立即扑上前去，原来头发是染色的，大鼻子也是装上的。再三追问，才晓得同样是军统局的特务专门化装成苏联人，做出许多坏事，借此来破坏中苏邦交。第二天，报纸上用大字标题登着一段新闻：苏联间谍在和平公园附近活动，企图暗杀我某高级长官，幸为我侦缉队员发觉，经猛烈格斗后，终将其擒获云。”\n    同年秋后，他调至暂编第三师，被派往彰武招募新兵，勾结胡匪，破坏内蒙人民自卫军，陷害我民主政府县区干部。曾有一个区政委被他捕捉送往沈阳集中营，解放区鲁北（热河开鲁北新设县）范县长亦曾为其设伏俘虏，后被解放军救出。东北蒋匪军事当局为掩饰其军事失败，进行欺骗宣传，曾强迫被抓来的新兵承认是被俘的民主联军。他写道：“沈阳（蒋匪）长官部曾不断向南京捏报俘虏八路军几百几千。（蒋匪）国防部派人点检之前，（蒋匪）长官部就派人对新兵说：你们想穿美式军装吗？你们想吃大米白面吗？点检委员来时，只要你们承认是八路俘虏，一切全可解决。这些新兵如同囚犯，他们还敢说个不字吗？点检委员来了，新兵便整队高呼：我们是投诚过来的！我们是被俘来的！三个假俘虏部队，事后被（蒋匪）国防部编为青年训导总队。这批新兵有了两个番号，一方面属于暂三师，同时又是训总队。每月造两份名册，领两份薪养。但这些新兵依旧是穿不上吃不上，两份饷，一份也捞不着。”\n    王少奇深恨其以前种种反革命、屠杀人民的罪行，他在文章结尾称：“我做了这许许多多的罪恶事情，现在想来真是死有余辜。但想不到我幸运的获得了民主联军的解救，并教育了我，使我认清了自己过去的罪恶。”"

    "content": "Chiang Kai-shek's Special Agents Sneak into Our Area\n  　Bo'ai Captures Seventeen\n\n    [Bo'ai News] Recently, the Chiang bandits have been continuously sending special agents to our liberated areas to carry out sabotage and make a desperate struggle. In order to completely crush Chiang Kai-shek's special agent policy, our front-line soldiers and civilians launched a mass capture campaign. The militia, self-defense forces, rotational warfare teams, and troops of various villages in the front were all mobilized. Within ten days, they captured seventeen armed and unarmed special agent bullies sent by the enemy, and seized two guns and four hand grenades. Among them, Li Ao Village captured black gunman Liu Lu and major special agent leader Li Chunxi, which was the best and received commendation from the county headquarters. Following this, Baishan and Qifang also captured several special agents sent by the enemy. In this movement, the leadership promptly encouraged and commended typical models, inspiring everyone's enthusiasm. After Li Ao Village and the Sixth District Rotational Warfare Team were commended, people in the Fourth District, after reading the circular, all said, \"We must occupy a page alone\" (meaning they must achieve results). On the same day, before dawn, they set off to ambush two miles away from the enemy stronghold, and as a result, captured nine bullies. The morale of other village militia teams was very high, competing to perform meritorious deeds. They also created a lot of experience in methods: finding the enemy's activity patterns and our dead-end areas of activity. Our methods of activity must not allow special agents to find loopholes. The most important thing is to launch a mass capture. When guarding and patrolling in the village, when hearing movements or suspicious places, focus on thorough investigation. For example, in Li Ao Village, they heard dogs barking on the south street of the village at night and knew something was up. At dawn, village cadres and militiamen went to investigate and found black gunman Liu Lu in an uninhabited house. When an eighteen-year-old militiaman Zhao Sanguang saw him, he said, \"Old brother, aren't we acquainted?\" (meaning they knew each other in the past). Comrade Sanguang shouted, \"No, put down your gun, if you don't put it down, I'll hit you with a grenade.\" With this shout, everyone came together to capture him. One gun and two hand grenades were seized.\n    In addition, it is also important to pursue clues after capturing special agents. For example, after Li Ao Village captured Liu Lu, they asked for a confession and learned that Li Chunxi had not left yet. The leadership was determined to capture him, and as a result, they captured him at 7:00 p.m. that same day.

    "content": "Indonesia and China\n　　The People's Daily Reference Room\n　　After the Japanese devils surrendered, Dutch imperialists, supported by U.S. imperialism, attacked the Indonesian people, suppressing the Indonesian people's national liberation movement. Chiang Kai-shek acted as an accomplice to the U.S. and Dutch imperialists, shamelessly engaging in traitorous diplomacy to please his American daddy. On December 6th of last year, he signed an aviation agreement with the Netherlands, allowing Dutch planes to fly freely over China, using Shanghai, Tianjin, Kunming, and Guangzhou as their airports; selling aviation rights to his American daddy and to the Dutch bandits. In the Security Council, Chiang's representative even proposed that India and the Netherlands each designate a representative, and that India and the Netherlands select a third country's representative to form a committee. This was exactly the same as the proposal made by the Dutch representative. This was an attempt to deny the Security Council's right to deal with the Indonesian issue and to open a separate path for his American daddy to \"mediate\" (interfere in Indonesia) alone, fully supporting U.S. and Dutch efforts to split Indonesia. On the third day after this conspiracy to split Indonesia was proposed, Chiang Chia-tung, Chiang's consul-general in Batavia, colluded with the Dutch and, without Indonesia's consent, established a so-called \"Overseas Chinese Security Corps\" special agent organization in the Dutch-occupied areas of Indonesia. At the same time, he demanded that Indonesia also agree to establish a similar special agent organization in the Indonesian liberated areas, but the Indonesian government refused. Chiang Kai-shek established such a special agent organization and prepared to expand it in order to provoke discord between the Indonesian people and the overseas Chinese, to facilitate the aggression of U.S. and Dutch imperialism. A little over ten days after this special agent organization was established, more than 6,000 overseas Chinese fled from the Dutch-occupied areas to the Indonesian liberated areas for refuge; recently, nearly a thousand overseas Chinese compatriots were brutally murdered by the Dutch imperialists, and thousands of overseas Chinese compatriots were arrested and subjected to torture. From this, we can see the ferocious face of the Dutch imperialists and the ugly face of Chiang Kai-shek as their accomplice.\n　　The Chinese people and the Indonesian people stand on the same front, resolutely opposing the aggression of U.S. and Dutch imperialism and the fascist rule of Chiang Kai-shek. The Chinese people in Indonesia are very harmonious with the Indonesian people, caring for and sympathizing with each other. For example, the more than 6,000 overseas Chinese who fled from the Dutch-occupied areas of Indonesia due to persecution by Dutch and Chiang special agents were received and assisted by Indonesia when they arrived in the Indonesian liberated areas. In addition to providing food and finding accommodation, they were also given medical treatment. In August of last year, Indonesia promulgated a law protecting overseas Chinese; subsequently, the Indonesian representative also declared in the Security Council that the safety of the lives and property of overseas Chinese in the Indonesian region would be protected. The Chinese people in Indonesia, along with the Indian and Filipino people who sympathize with the Indonesian people's liberation movement, formed international columns and fought alongside the Indonesian army to resist the Dutch imperialist aggression. The Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army organized by the Chinese people in Solo also participated in this just resistance. The Chinese people in Yogyakarta donated a large amount of money, sugar, and clothing to the Republic of Indonesia as war funds to support Indonesia's protracted resistance. After this major bloodshed created by the U.S., Dutch, and Chiang forces, the overseas Chinese compatriots in Indonesia will inevitably be more vigilant against the conspiracies and tricks of the U.S., Dutch, and Chiang forces, and will surely join hands with the Indonesian people to fight against the common enemy.

With these weapons, we could establish more than ten divisions.\n    When Chiang Kai-shek first started the civil war, he was attacking our liberated areas, and the fighting often took place in the liberated areas. Last year, the war situation changed. We wiped out Chiang Kai-shek's troops who invaded the liberated areas, and our troops fought their way into his old nest. It's like climbing a mountain; we reached the top and knocked Chiang Kai-shek down from the top. He's rolling lower and lower, and he'll fall to his death eventually. Our Liu-Deng army has already fought its way to Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, and established new liberated areas in the Dabie Mountains.

    "content": "【Taiyue News】In Xishan Administrative Village, Jincheng Seventh District, after rent and interest reduction in 1942 and land reform in the years before and after last year, there are still hired and poor peasants being pressed under a \"stone slab\", living a difficult life. Seventeen households currently have nothing to eat, thirteen can only eat until the end of the lunar year, and others can only eat until the second month of spring. The reason why poor and hired peasants have not been able to turn over is mainly because the village's power is still controlled by rich peasant elements. Among the village cadres, there are twelve rich peasants; only two poor peasants, and they are not key cadres. Although poor and hired peasants also obtained some land and houses in the struggle last year, most of the fruits were monopolized by a few people. For example, more than sixty sheep were seized last year, but the poor and hired peasants didn't get one, and they were all divided up by five village cadres. During the land reform, the village cadres advocated \"mobilizing\" three mu of land from Li Erfu, and the political director Wei Dexin seized one mu of good land to plant, giving the poor and hired peasants small pieces of bad land to cultivate. The poor and hired peasants Mao Hai and Su Tang said, \"We don't know how to cultivate good land!\" The village cadres also distributed the fruits of labor to the targets of struggle. For example, the rich peasant Da Feng mixed into the women's association as a standing committee member. Her father-in-law committed great crimes and was beaten to death by the masses in struggle. Last year, the chairman of the farmers' association even gave her five sheep, more than one shi of grain, more than one mu of good land, and clothes. During the land reform, Wei Dexin obtained many houses. Although he gave two rooms to the masses, he asked the masses to repair the houses for him. The chairman of the farmers' association, Li Chengliang, beat six basic members of the masses during the mass movement, and many were detained. When the middle-lower peasant Li Xueru had some opinions on preferential treatment for resistance against the enemy, Li Chengliang heard about it and held a meeting the next day to completely criticize Li Xueru. From then on, the hired and poor peasants did not dare to say anything. There are many military families in the village, and the masses are too busy with substitute farming, so they also have to do substitute farming for the cooperative manager Wei Xuexin, which the masses are very dissatisfied with. This time, when they obtained a loan, they did not consult with the masses for the 200,000 loan and bought salt and sheep. When letting the masses burn charcoal, they did not explain how much money per jin, but only said, \"Burning charcoal for a month without pay can be counted as a share.\" The masses did not dare not to do it, but they were very unmotivated. In the past, they could burn eighty to one hundred jin per day, but now they only burn twenty-five jin per day. The masses said, \"One bowl of vegetables, vegetables in one bowl, it's just these few people after all.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 富农混当村干成了石板　西山卅户贫雇没吃喝\n\n1948-01-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　富农混当村干成了石板\n  　西山卅户贫雇没吃喝\n    【太岳消息】晋城七区西山行政村经过四二年的减租减息和去年前年的土地改革，直到现在，还有雇贫农被压在石板底下，过着困苦的生活。有十七户眼下就没吃的，十三户可吃到旧历年底，其他还有的只能吃到春天二月。贫雇没有翻身，主要是因为村里大权还被富农分子掌握着。村干部里有富农十二个；只有两个贫农，还不是主要干部。去年斗争中贫雇农虽也得了一部分土地和房子，但大部分果实被少数人独占了。如去年斗出六十多个羊，贫雇农没得上一个，都被五个村干部分了。在土地改革时，村干部主张“动员”了李二富三亩地，政治主任卫德信就抢种了一亩好地，把两边的小块坏地给贫雇种了。贫雇农毛孩、宿堂说：“咱不会种好地！”村干部还给斗争对象分了果实，如富农大凤混进妇会当常委，他公公罪恶大被群众斗争打死了，去年农会主席还给她分了五个羊、一石多粮食、一亩多好地和衣服。土地改革时，卫德信得的房子多，虽给群众让出两间，可是又叫群众给他修房。农会主席李成亮在群运中打了六个基本群众，被扣过的很多。下中农李雪如对优抗上有些意见，李成亮听见，第二天开会就把李雪如斗光了。从此以后，雇贫啥话都不敢说了。村里军属很多，群众代耕都忙不过来，还得给合作社经理卫学信代耕，群众很不满意。这次贷款时，他们又把二十万贷款没有通过群众，买成盐及羊。让群众烧木炭，也不说明每斤多少钱，只说：“烧一月木炭不给钱，可以顶成股”。群众都不敢不干，干着又很没劲。过去每天能烧八十斤到一百斤，现在每天只烧二十五斤。群众说：“一碗菜，菜一碗，就是这几个人罢了”。"

    "content": "Land Redistribution Will Thoroughly Liberate Us\n  　Nanmazhuang Villagers Enthusiastically Discuss the Land Law\n    [Lucheng News] After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, the cadres of Nanmazhuang felt that they could not explain and publicize it to the masses, fearing it would affect the masses' production enthusiasm. They only broadcast on the radio station: \"Attention everyone, we have good news for you. The Chinese Communist Party has convened a land conference and promulgated the Land Law Outline, which will implement land redistribution, taking from those who have more to supplement those who have less, and taking from the fertile land to supplement the barren land.\" After this cursory announcement, many people's minds were confused. The government called for the combination of transportation, fertilizer delivery, and discussion of methods, but only talked about it without taking action. After identifying the reasons, first, a forum of poor and hired peasants was held, followed by a village-wide mass meeting the second night (landlords and rich peasants did not participate). The sixteen articles of the Land Law and the editorial in the Xinhua Daily on the 15th were read to everyone, and discussions were launched. Old Han Huanchang said: \"Now I know the Land Law is good. The other day I heard on the radio about land redistribution, and I thought it meant putting all the land in one place and redistributing it.\" Old Han Jiang Zhuhai said: \"The Land Law Outline really points the way for us poor and hired peasants, and it makes it clear that middle and poor peasants are one family. We must be careful of the landlords' sabotage.\" Jinchang said: \"I thought it meant taking everything out and distributing it equally, and everyone eating together. Today I learned that it means distributing the landlords' land and property to us, to completely liberate us.\" Zhang Banglu said: \"I think that we should only give the landlords and rich peasants a share after they have been thoroughly struggled against and have bowed their heads.\" Jin Shuang said: \"That's right! Take our village landlords, for example. They used to farm five hectares of land, enjoying themselves and exploiting us. Now they're still better dressed than us, even when they're penniless. That can't be allowed.\" Yunsuo said: \"In the redistribution, give each young person enough land for three people (married with children), and each strong elderly person enough land for two people. This is very considerate of the poor and hired peasants.\" Jiang Lizhen (Director of Public Security) said: \"The Communist Party's policy is truly broad-minded. Even the families of those who work for the Kuomintang will receive the same share as us. This is different from the old society.\" Old Han Guo Ji Zhi (prosperous middle peasant) said: \"The Land Law Outline is really good. My family has four people and farms thirty-five or six mu of land, which is really too much to handle. It's also hard to hire people. I am willing to give up my surplus land.\" After a heated discussion, the old man smiled and stroked his beard, saying: \"Good! This is completely different from what we thought the other day. Now we can rest assured and deliver fertilizer.\" Finally, it was decided to combine transportation and fertilizer delivery, organize livestock, concentrate their use, with three people driving six animals, working in two shifts to deliver fertilizer. Semi-able-bodied people drive the animals, and able-bodied people carry fertilizer, and women help load the animals. Six hundred loads of fertilizer have now been delivered to the fields. The general wage is three jin of rice per work unit, and four and a half jin of rice per livestock work unit. Small cooperatives, with four people, also allocate two people to carry fertilizer, and two people to sell tofu and cut thatch. The work is now in full swing.\n　　　\n    　　(Jin Shuang, Jian Wen)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 平分是为咱们彻底翻身　南马庄群众热烈讨论土地法\n金双　建文\n1948-01-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　平分是为咱们彻底翻身\n  　南马庄群众热烈讨论土地法\n    【潞城消息】公布出土地法大纲后，南马庄干部认为不能向群众宣传解释，怕影响群众生产情绪，只是在广播台广播说：“大家注意，给你报告个好消息，中国共产党召开土地会议，颁布土地法大纲，要实行土地平分，抽多补少，抽肥补瘦。”囫囵吞枣的播了一下，这样把好多群众思想混乱了。政府号召运输送肥结合，讨论出办法，光说不去作。找出原因后，首先召开干部贫雇座谈会，接着第二夜召开全村群众大会（地主富农未参加），给大家念过土地法十六条及十五日新华日报上社论，展开讨论。焕昌老汉说：“这会我才知道土地法好呀，前两天听广播平分土地哩，我心想是把所有土地，堆在一块来重分一下。”姜注海老汉说：“土地法大纲真是为咱贫雇，更指明中贫农是一家人，咱要注意地主破坏。”进昌说：“我心想是把东西都拿出来平分，大家在一块吃饭，今天我才知道是将地主土地财产平分给咱，叫咱彻底翻身。”张邦路说：“给地主富农分一份，我意见是斗的彻底、低了头后，才给他分。”金双说：对呀！象咱村地主过去人家种五顷地，怎享福怎剥削咱来，现在光溜溜的比咱穿的还好，这样可不行。云锁说：“在平分时青年一人给他分上三个人的土地（结婚生子），壮老年一人分给他两人的土地，照顾贫雇真周到。”姜礼珍（公安主任）说：“共产党政策真是宽宏大量，在国民党那里办事人，其家庭也和咱一样分，可和以前社会不一样。”郭冀只老汉（富裕中农）说：“土地法大纲真好，象我一家四口人，种三十五六亩地，实在种不过来，雇人也不好雇。我情愿将我多余的土地拿出来。”经大家热烈讨论后，老汉摸着胡须笑盈盈的说：“好呀！和咱前两天想的完全不一样，这咱可安心好好送肥吧。”最后讨论，在运输送肥结合下，组织牲口，集中使用，三个人赶六个牲口，倒两班送肥。半劳力赶牲口，全劳力担肥，妇女帮助装驮。现已送到地里六百多担肥，一般的工资每工三斤米，牲口每工四斤半米，小型社共四人，也抽出二人担肥，二人卖豆腐、割白草，现已轰烈的干起来。　\n　　　\n    　　（金双、建文）"

    "content": "The Peasant Movement in Democratic Southeastern Europe\nBy L. Konstantinovsky, translated by He Ge\n\nAfter the war, the conditions of the peasants in the Southeastern European countries liberated from the clutches of fascism underwent profound changes. The most noteworthy of these was the land reform implemented in these countries. What political and economic consequences did this land reform bring about? What role does the peasant class play in these countries that have resolutely embarked on the road of democratic development? What are the differences between the current situation of the peasant masses and that before the war?\n\nThe Peasants of Southeastern Europe Before the War\n\nIn the history of pre-war Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria, we can find some typical phenomena that are unique to all agricultural countries in Eastern and Southeastern Europe.\n\nIn the past, the political role of the peasant class in these countries was primarily determined by general economic and social backwardness. All these countries had a distinct agricultural character. According to pre-war statistics, over 78% of the self-reliant residents in Yugoslavia were distributed in the agricultural economy, 78.2% in Romania, and 79.8% in Bulgaria. The characteristics of the agricultural economic organization in these countries were the overwhelming majority of small-scale peasant economies and the widespread retention of feudal remnants. In pre-war Yugoslavia, over 70% of farm households had less than five hectares of land. In Romania, such farm households accounted for 74.9%, and in Bulgaria, 63.1%.\n\nAlthough the land reform of 1918 weakened the large landowners in Romania and relatively reduced them in Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, they still played a huge role. They were fanatical executors of reactionary, anti-people policies. Backward agricultural relations hindered the economic development of Eastern European countries. It greatly facilitated the occupation of a major economic position in these countries by foreign capital.\n\nThese are some common characteristics inherent in all Southeastern European countries, reflecting their consistent backwardness. The poor and miserable masses of small peasants could not exert a serious influence on the fate of the country. The majority of Southeastern European peasant parties had an insurmountable contradiction: the mass base of these parties was the broad peasant class, while the leaders were landlords and capitalist elements. In the actual activities of these parties, the interests of a few leaders were paramount. Therefore, the so-called peasant governments declared bankruptcy during the period between the two world wars, and they stubbornly resisted the workers' movement. Therefore, the leaders of the so-called peasant parties surrendered to fascism.\n\nThe Peasants of Southeastern Europe During the War\n\nDuring World War II, the Southeastern European countries experienced different fates. However, the experience of the people pointed to the same conclusion. We only need to look at two examples—Yugoslavia and Romania—to suffice.\n\nIn Yugoslavia, the invasion of German and Italian troops (April 1941) caused all previous parties, except for the progressive workers' party, to collapse. The leaders of the peasant parties were often the first to surrender. For example, the reactionary leaders of the Croatian Peasant Party, who were under Hitler's influence even before the war, adopted a compromise stance towards the German fascist aggression. They supported the partition of Czechoslovakia. It was not accidental or unexpected that Maček called on Croatian peasants to join the \"volunteer army\" (a part of the Pavelić army).\n\nHowever, the Yugoslav peasant class responded to the betrayal of the peasant party leaders by embarking on the path indicated by the progressive workers' movement—the leaders of the resistance against the German aggressors. The majority of participants in the Yugoslav Liberation War were peasants. Without them, it would not have been possible to conduct such a long-lasting and successful guerrilla war. Under the influence of the resolute actions of the peasant masses, many old leaders of the peasant parties also changed, refusing to cooperate with the occupiers and unconditionally joining the People's Front.\n\n\"Many leaders came to where their masses were, because otherwise they would be detached from the masses and isolated,\" General Tito said in his speech at the first congress of the Yugoslav People's Front.\n\nThe situation in Romania was different. This country belonged to the Hitlerite alliance. Here, there was no large-scale anti-fascist movement during the war. The political consciousness of the Romanian peasant class was not yet able to complete the path completed by the Yugoslav peasants. However, in Romania, the war also completely exposed the reactionary leadership structure of the National Țărănist Party. (The Țărănist Party was a party of the rural bourgeoisie and some urban intellectuals formed by the Moldavian National Party when the Romanians occupied Bessarabia; later, members of the party joined the Romanian National Peasants' Party.)\n\n\"Maniu's strategy\" eased the difficulties of Antonescu's rule. Maniu actually supported the Rome alliance and the anti-Soviet war, which brought suffering and bankruptcy to the Romanian peasants. Mihalache, the vice-chairman of the National Țărănist Party, openly sent \"volunteers\" to Antonescu's fascist army. Prominent figures of the party, such as Bobu, made fortunes from the war, cooperating not only with the German fascists but also colluding with the Hungarian feudal forces that plundered Outer Transylvania.\n\nSince the overthrow of the Antonescu regime, the Romanian peasants have drawn appropriate conclusions. They demonstrated unprecedented political activity, abandoning Maniu's pseudo-peasant party and beginning to enthusiastically support the progressive democratic parties in the country and the Groza government formed by them.\n\nTherefore, during the war years, profound and drastic changes in the political role of the peasants occurred everywhere (although unevenly). On the desolate land, among the ruins and remnants, new and increasingly vigorous buds emerged after the collapse of Hitler's Germany.\n\nThe Economic Life of Peasants in Southeastern Europe After the War\n\nThe fundamental changes that have taken place in the conditions of the peasants of Eastern Europe are two-fold: economic and political. Let us first look at the economic aspect:\n\nIn all the countries that established new democratic systems after the victory over fascism, the remnants of feudalism were first eliminated. This great historical task was accomplished by the close cooperation of the working class and the peasant class.\n\nThe nature of land reform is primarily determined by who carries out the movement and how. When land reform is carried out by the ruling class, its purpose is only to appease and deceive the peasants, as was the case after World War I. At that time, land reform was carried out from above, dragged on for years, and was virtually never completed anywhere. By 1940, twenty years after Romania approved the land reform law, the country's Minister of Agriculture stated:\n\n\"Land reform has not yet been completed... Of the 3,900 estates, the portion to be confiscated has not yet been fully confiscated; allocation plans and programs have not yet been formulated for 434,000 hectares of land; 490,000 hectares of land have not been allocated, and 900 land reform cases are still under review in the courts.\"\n\nIn Bulgaria, the land reform decree was abolished after the fascist coup of 1923.\n\nNow, land reform in Eastern Europe is carried out by progressive democratic governments with the assistance of local committees established by the peasants. This land reform has a radical nature. Large landowners and all feudal remnants have been completely eliminated. The idleness of the large landowners has been completely eliminated. The land to be distributed has not only been investigated and registered but also distributed to the poor peasants without hesitation. In countries such as Poland, Romania, and Hungary, the land of the major nobles was completely distributed to the peasants in less than a year.\n\nThe so-called land reform after World War I resulted in even greater bankruptcy for the peasant masses. The new landowners, who lost all assistance, immediately became prisoners of usurers and banks. Many peasants soon lost the land they had acquired.\n\nNow, when genuine democratic systems have been established in Eastern European countries and all measures have been taken to consolidate the land acquired by the peasants, the situation is completely different. In the new democratic countries, the government provides the peasants with enormous material assistance. Land ownership limits have been established everywhere, the previous debts of the peasants have been abolished, the power of usurers and banks has been ended, cooperatives have been encouraged as much as possible, and prerequisites have been established for the mechanization and advancement of the agricultural economy.\n\nThe socio-economic reforms implemented in the new democratic countries—the nationalization of heavy industry and banks, and the planning of the national economy—effectively solved the task of strengthening the agricultural economy. Despite all the difficulties of the post-war period, great achievements have been made in this regard.\n\nBulgaria is a model example. In order to distribute land to all poor farm households, this country needed more than one million hectares of arable land, but where could so much land come from? On March 12, 1946, the National Assembly passed the \"Law on Labor Land Ownership,\" which is divided into two parts. The first part stipulates the nature and scale of the new land reform. The second part stipulates the enormous work of reclaiming wasteland, improving land, and encouraging rural cooperatives. Cooperatives can obtain everything necessary from the state in order to utilize the advantages of mechanized large-scale operations. The Fatherland Front's agricultural policy strives to transform the agricultural economy on a higher and more effective basis. The first representative conference of agricultural economic labor cooperatives was held in Sofia in February of this year. There are now 438 such cooperatives, uniting more than 44,000 members and successfully reclaiming no less than 200,000 hectares of land.\n\nThe new democratic land reform and all agricultural policies, no matter how difficult the conditions of the post-war period, have already shown progressive economic consequences. The distribution of land guaranteed the spring plowing of 1945, when, after the victory of democracy, the landlords attempted to halt agricultural economic production and cause famine in the country. The new masters of the land worked with great enthusiasm, hoping to eliminate the food difficulties as soon as possible.\n\nUndoubtedly, the rise of the laboring peasants of Eastern Europe in place of the aristocratic landowners will produce huge positive results in the near future. It is not easy to eliminate the consequences of the war and Hitler's occupation. Imagine that in a country like Yugoslavia, the losses suffered by the agricultural economy due to war and occupation amounted to 268 billion dinars. The losses of the Polish agricultural economy exceeded 23 billion zlotys, and the consecutive droughts in some areas made the situation even worse.\n\nHowever, despite all this, the material conditions of the broad peasant masses have still greatly improved.\n\nThe peasant classes in these countries had previously never known that there was a regime that could implement (even partially) policies to protect the interests of the peasants, as the governments of the Eastern European countries are currently doing. The peasants had never seen such attention paid to them not only by the government but also by the whole of society. The economic policies of the new democratic system, the drastic changes in agricultural relations—these are the roots of the new political stance of the peasant class and the roots of the consolidation of the democratic foundation in the countryside.

In the election of the Transport and General Workers' Union (note: this is the largest trade union in Britain, with 1.3 million members), several well-known communists, such as Lement and Slack, have been re-elected as executive committee members of the union. In South Wales, despite official opposition, British Communist Party member Harris was re-elected as the national representative of the urban branch of the union. The Manchester Trades Council has rejected the unreasonable demand of Labor Party reactionary member Wallers to prohibit Communist Party members from being elected in trade union organizations, and expressed their love for the British Communist Party by electing Communist Party member Gorua as the chairman of the union. British Communist Party member Tilbury has been elected as a member of the London District Committee of the Electrical Trades Union. The number of votes he received was more than the total number of votes of the other four candidates. At the same time, local trade unions in London are rising up to resolutely fight against the anti-communist conspiracy of the Labor Party. The London West Branch of the Association of Scientific Workers has recently rejected the reactionary proposal of some reactionary trade union bureaucrats to remove Communist Party members from leading positions in trade unions. The Kennington (South London) Trades Council, as well as three local trade unions, including the machinists and electrical workers, have resolved to condemn the anti-communist movement launched by Labor Party leader Philip. Progressive elements in the Labor Party are increasingly dissatisfied with the party's reactionary policies. For example, Simpson, a well-known member of the Scottish Denny and East Dunbartonshire Labor Party local party and city council member, Livingstone, the vice-chairman of the Denny Labor Party branch, and MacGrinles, the branch secretary of the party, have recently voluntarily left the party and joined the British Communist Party.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 职工会改选斗争中　英共获新胜利　工党进步分子纷纷加入英共\n\n1948-01-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　职工会改选斗争中\n  　英共获新胜利\n  　工党进步分子纷纷加入英共\n    【新华社陕北廿五日电】伦敦讯：据工人日报讯：最近数日英共在职工会改选斗争中，继续获得新的辉煌胜利。在运输业及各业工人工会（按这是英国最大的职工会，有一百卅万会员）的选举中，著名共产党人莱孟特与斯拉克等数人，已再度当选为该工会执行委员。在南威尔士，即使有官方的反对，英共哈里斯仍被连选连任为该工会城市区支部的全国代表。曼彻斯特工会委员会已否决工党反动党员瓦勒斯所提不准英共党人在工会团体中当选的无理要求，并以选举共产党人高鲁亚为该工会主席，来表示他们对英共的爱戴。英共党员梯尔伯利，已被选为电汽工会伦敦区委员会委员。他所获得的票数，比其他四个候选人的总票数还要多。同时，伦敦各地方工会纷起与工党反共阴谋作坚决斗争。科学工人协会伦敦西区分会，顷已否决了某些反动工会官僚所提革除共产党人在职工会中领导地位的反动建议。堪伯威尔（伦敦南部）工会委员会职工以及机器匠及电汽工人等三个地方工会，决议谴责工党头子菲利浦所发动的反共运动。工党中的进步分子对该党反动政策日益不满。例如苏格兰的丁尼与东尼白斯工党地方党著名党员市议会议员辛浦生、丁尼工党支部副主席李文斯东与该党支书麦克格林勒斯，最近已自动脱离该党加入英共。"

    "content": "Eliminate departmentalism and individualism\n  　Our newspaper's purchasing agent punished for smuggling a printing press\n    [Our Newspaper News] After the recovery of Shijiazhuang, Comrade Yin Deyi of our newspaper's purchasing department went to purchase printing equipment. On November 25th, he transported back a printing press. According to him, when he arrived in Shimen, the Chiang Kai-shek planes were indiscriminately bombing the urban area. He saw a folio letterpress in the original Railway Bureau printing house and thought, \"If it is destroyed by enemy planes, it will be a loss to the revolution.\" Therefore, without asking for instructions or notifying the municipal authorities, he transported the printing press back. When the newspaper leadership heard Comrade Yin's report, they immediately gave him severe criticism, pointing out that this action was a major mistake. Because if this machine belonged to a merchant, privately transporting it back would cause losses to the merchant. If it was enemy and bandit material seized by the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, privately transporting it back would also violate organizational discipline. Comrade Yin Deyi was ordered to stay in the ongoing Three Check-ups study session in the newspaper at the time to deeply reflect on this \"grab a profit\" mentality and style, and a letter was sent to Comrade Huang Jing of the Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau to express apologies and self-criticism for lax education and management of cadres. At the same time, opinions on how to handle this matter were requested. Comrade Huang Jing replied, confirming that this machine was indeed enemy and bandit material, and that our region should handle Yin's personal actions ourselves.\n    After 25 days of reflection, Comrade Yin realized that behind his thought that \"If it is destroyed by enemy planes, it will be a loss to the revolution,\" there were many personal motives hidden. He thought of showing off and demonstrating his ability to his superiors, comrades, and newly married wife, \"to replenish the printing factory completely and make the name Yin Deyi forever remembered in the hearts of the comrades in the factory.\" Blinded by these many personal motives, he forgot that \"this is an act of violating discipline and stealing the fruits of victory achieved by the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region people through bloodshed and sacrifice.\" Comrade Yin expressed deep remorse and requested the Party to impose severe punishment, and wrote a letter to Comrade Huang Jing reporting the leadership's criticism of him and the detailed process of this matter.\n    From Comrade Yin Deyi's reflection, the responsible comrades of this newspaper further understood the truth of the matter, believing that this \"grabbing a profit\" style was serious departmentalism, which only cared about the interests of one's own small unit and disregarded the overall revolutionary interests, resulting in damage to the Party's influence and urban discipline. This was irresponsible to the people and exploited a temporary chaotic phenomenon in the war. It was decided to give Comrade Yin Deyi a severe reprimand and dismissal from his job, and to give the purchasing department a warning. It was also pointed out that the reason why this matter was dealt with leniently was because the occurrence of this matter was mainly due to many errors and shortcomings in Comrade Yin Deyi's thinking, but also related to the leadership's insufficient education of comrades in the past and the imperfect nature of certain system regulations. Therefore, this matter will be used to educate the entire staff, thoroughly eliminate any departmentalism and individualism. And it is stipulated that from now on, in recovered cities, no personnel such as reporters, purchasers, and distributors are allowed to enter the city without official orders. Those who enter the city on orders must maintain a hard-working style, be honest and self-disciplined, strictly abide by discipline, and not take a single needle or thread, whether public or private property, otherwise they will be subject to severe disciplinary action.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 肃清本位主义个人主义　本报采购员私运印刷机受处分\n\n1948-01-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　肃清本位主义个人主义\n  　本报采购员私运印刷机受处分\n    【本报消息】本报采购处殷德宇同志在石家庄收复后，前往购买印刷器材。于十一月二十五日运回印刷机一架。据他说：他到石门时，正是蒋机滥炸市区，他在原铁路局印刷所看见一部对开铅印机，想道：“被敌机炸坏了是革命的损失。”于是没有请示与通知市政当局，就把这部印刷机运回来了。当时本报领导上听了殷同志这种报告，立即给予严厉的批评。指出这种行动是一个重大的错误。因为这部机器如果是商民的，私自运回就使商民受了损失。如果是晋察冀边区缴获的敌匪物资，私自运回也违犯了组织纪律。责成殷德宇同志留在当时本报正在进行的三查学习中，深入反省这种“捞一把”的思想和作风，并给晋察冀中央局黄敬同志去信，表示歉意，对教育管理干部不严作了自我批评。同时并商请对这件事情的处理意见。黄敬同志复信证实这部机器确系敌匪物资，对殷个人行动要我区自己处理。\n    殷同志经过二十五天的反省，认识到自己在“被敌机炸坏了是革命的损失”的思想后面，藏着许多个人目的。自己想着出个风头，在上级、同志和才结婚的妻子面前表示自己的能干，“把印刷厂补充得完完整整，使殷德宇三个字永记在工厂同志的心目中。”在这许多个人目的的蒙蔽下，就忘记了“这是违犯纪律、盗取晋察冀边区人民流血牺牲的胜利果实的行为。”殷同志表示深为悔悟，请求党给予严重的处分，并把领导上对他的批评和这件事情的详细经过，写信报告了黄敬同志。\n    本报负责同志从殷德宇同志的反省中，进一步了解了事情的真象，认为这种“捞摸一把”的作风，是严重的本位主义，是只顾自己小单位的利益，不顾全局革命利益，结果破坏了党的影响和城市纪律。这是对人民不负责任，钻了战争中某种暂时的混乱现象的空子。当决定给予殷德宇同志以严重斥责、撤销工作的处分；给予采购处以警告的处分。并指出：这件事之所以从轻处分，乃因为这件事情的发生，固然主要由于殷德宇同志思想上有许多错误和缺点，但领导上过去对同志们教育不够，某些制度规定的不严也有关系。因此以此事向全馆进行教育，彻底肃清任何本位主义与个人主义思想。并规定纪律：今后收复城市，无论记者、采购、发行等一切人员，非因公奉命不得入城。奉命入城者要保持艰苦作风，廉洁自守，严守纪律，不论公私财物不得拿取一针一线，否则要受到严重的纪律处分。"

    "date": "1948-01-27",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency short commentary:\n\n　　In the first ten days of January 1948, major cities in the Chiang-controlled areas experienced a new round of skyrocketing prices, with Shanghai, the economic center of the Chiang bandits, seeing the most intense price increases. Taking the price of rice in Shanghai as an example, it was 1 million yuan per shi (a unit of dry volume, approx. 100 litres) on January 2nd, but soared to 1.58 million yuan just a week later, an increase of about 60%. The U.S. dollar exchange rate surged to 220,000 yuan on the 8th, and other commodities and the stock market also saw prices skyrocket. The Associated Press recognized this as the most severe surge since the gold rush in February of last year. The Chiang currency plummeted, and some Shanghai merchants were raising prices overnight but still couldn't keep up with the pace of inflation. Some simply closed their doors temporarily, refusing to sell goods.\n\n　　This economic storm is just beginning. Although the tyrannical suppression by Chiang's economic agents around the 10th caused a small price correction, the direct and main factor causing this economic storm – a new and huge wave of malignant inflation – is playing and will continue to play a huge role. 100,000 yuan banknotes appeared in Chiang-controlled cities in the New Year of 1948, causing prices to soar as if by magic. More and more banknotes will be thrown into the Chiang-controlled market like a tide in the ocean. Another bigger demon is the threat of the Chiang bandits issuing new currency. The bandits have openly promoted that new currency will be issued, which means that tens of trillions of \"legal tender\" will depreciate by hundreds or thousands of times. The people in the Chiang-controlled areas will inevitably rush to buy goods with \"legal tender,\" and prices will inevitably rise further.\n\n　　Another important factor, and this factor will play an even more decisive role, is Chiang Kai-shek's military defeat. In Manchuria, North China, and even most of the rural areas of Central China, the Chiang currency can no longer be used. The Chiang currency that was originally concentrated in the cities of these areas has also largely fled to Shanghai and a few large cities in South China. Based on the increasing panic of the Chiang family bandits, these funds will inevitably engage in commercial speculation, powerfully accelerating the rise in prices.\n\n　　The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's economic crisis has reached the point of collapse. A large number of the bandit gang members feel that the end is near, and the day of the Chiang bandits' demise is not far off. Therefore, everyone is taking advantage of the situation, muddying the waters, and making plans for failure. Even during the short period when the Chiang bandits implemented suppression, they couldn't wait to hide for a few days and rushed to engage in black market transactions. Therefore, among the more than 100 black market traders arrested by Chiang's Shanghai economic agents in early January, many were \"responsible personnel\" of the bandit gang.\n\n　　During these three economic crises, the four major families, on the one hand, sent large compradors such as Bei Zuyi to the United States to beg for larger loans, and on the other hand, were determined to more cruelly plunder the small and medium-sized bourgeoisie and the broad masses of the people. In addition to preparing to issue new currency, this barbaric step, the bandit gang is also using high-interest loan policies to annex small and medium-sized industries, making them more directly enslaved by the four major families. During the price surge in November of last year, the four major families adopted a policy of suspending loans and restricting remittances. In early December, they also established a Gold Control Bureau, specifically restricting the activities of general banks and money shops, which put many small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises in a state of near bankruptcy during the critical juncture of the end of the year. After the economic storm re-emerged in January of this year, the Chiang bandit government used this difficulty to annex these small and medium-sized factories, stipulating that all textile, food, leather, cooking oil, sugar, fuel, and salt factories must hand over their products to the bandit government at official prices in the future, and then they could obtain loans from the four major banks controlled by the four major families.\n\n　　The more the Chiang bandit gang approaches its death, the more shameless and brutal its face becomes, and it is now fully exposed. The broad masses of the people and the small and medium-sized bourgeoisie in the Chiang-controlled areas can only save themselves by uniting more closely and fighting against the Chiang bandit gang.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋区今年第一个经济风暴\n\n1948-01-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋区今年第一个经济风暴\n    新华社短评\n    一九四八年第一个月头十天，蒋管区各大城市发生新的物价狂涨，尤以蒋匪经济中心的上海涨风更烈。以上海米价为例，一月二日每石一百万元，仅仅一周之后，暴涨至一百五十八万元，即约涨百分之六十；美金票市八日曾突涨至二十二万元，其他物品及股票市场亦莫不飞涨。合众社认此为去年二月黄金风潮以后最厉害的一次。蒋币暴跌，上海商人有的连夜提高定价还赶不上物价上涨的速度，有的干脆暂时关门，拒售货物。\n    这一经济风暴正在开始，虽然在十日左右蒋匪经济特务横蛮的镇压，曾使物价有小小的回跌，但造成这次经济风暴的直接的主要因素——新的巨大的恶性通货膨胀，正在而且更将起着巨大的作用。十万元大钞在一九四八年新年出现在蒋区各城市，使物价就象着了魔地向前飞跑。更多的大钞将如大海中的潮水一样被抛入蒋区市场。另外一个更大的魔鬼是蒋匪将发行新货币的威胁，匪帮已公开宣传新货币势将发行，这就是说几十万亿的“法币”将要千百倍的跌价，蒋区人民必然争先恐后地以“法币”竞购货物，物价必然更加上涨。\n    另一个重要的因素，而且这个因素将更加起着决定作用，是蒋介石的军事失败。满洲、华北乃至华中绝大部分农村已经不能使用蒋币，而原来集中于这些地区城市中的蒋币也大量逃向上海与华南少数大城市，在蒋家匪帮更加恐慌的基础上，这些资金也必然从事商业投机，有力的加速物价的上涨。\n    蒋介石匪帮的经济危机已到虚脱的程度，大批匪帮人员都感到日暮途穷，蒋匪灭亡之日不远，于是大家趁火打劫，混水摸鱼，作失败的打算。就是在蒋匪实行镇压的短时期内，也等不及躲避几天，抢着作黑市买卖，所以蒋匪上海经济特务在一月上旬中所拘捕的黑市交易者一百余人中，其中有许多就是匪帮“负责人员”。\n    四大家族在这三次经济危机中一面是派贝祖诒等大买办去美国哀求更大的贷款，一面是决心更残酷的掠夺中小资产阶级与广大人民。除了准备发行新币这一野蛮步骤外，匪帮更利用高利贷的贷款政策并吞中小工业，使之更直接为四大家族所奴役。去年十一月物价狂涨时，四大家族采取了停止贷款与限制汇兑的政策，十二月初并成立了金管局，专门限制一般银行钱庄的活动，这就使得许多中小工商业在去年年关紧急关头中陷于濒于破产的局面。而今年一月的经济风暴再起之后，蒋匪政府却利用这个困难进行吞并这些中小工厂，规定所有纺织、食品、皮革、食油、糖、燃料、食盐等工厂今后均须将生产品按官价交给匪帮政府，然后可以得四大家族控制下之四大银行之贷款。\n    蒋匪帮在愈近死亡时，愈加无耻与残暴的面貌，现已暴露无遗。蒋区广大人民与中小资产阶级要想自救，只有更加团结对蒋匪帮进行斗争。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency Reporter Comments on the Tragedy of Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies;\nLiberated Area People Protest in Grief and Indignation;\nCalling on Compatriots Nationwide and Overseas to Support Indonesian Overseas Chinese\n\n(Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th) A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on the plight of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, stating:\n\nRecently, nine hundred overseas Chinese in Indonesia were collectively massacred by Dutch imperialists, and thousands more are detained in prisons, their fate unknown.\n\nThis bloodbath is a bloody record jointly orchestrated by American and Dutch imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government. The reason why Dutch aggressors dare to commit such heinous crimes is precisely because the US imperialists and Chiang bandits encourage and support their war of aggression against Indonesia.\n\nAs everyone knows, the Chiang bandits pursue a traitorous foreign policy, repeatedly publicly slandering and antagonizing the Indonesian people's struggle for independence and liberation. To take a recent example: In November of last year, the Chiang bandits colluded with US, Dutch, and other imperialists to prevent Indonesia from participating in the Far East and Asia Economic Conference. In mid-December, the Chiang bandit consulate general in Batavia instigated the Batavia General Chamber of Commerce to participate in the West Java separatist movement conference hosted by Van Mook. With the full support of the Chiang bandits, Dutch imperialism has more frantically launched a joint Dutch-Chiang offensive aimed at persecuting all overseas Chinese. At the same time, it must be pointed out that the Dutch imperialist massacre of overseas Chinese is not the first time. As far back as 1940, the \"Red River Massacre\" saw the collective killing of 10,000 Chinese coolies. For two hundred years, Dutch imperialism has continuously provoked ethnic hatred between Chinese and Indonesian peoples. Around the time of the Indonesian Revolution of 1926-27, thousands of overseas Chinese youths were arrested, deported, exiled, and massacred by the Dutch. Dutch imperialism is the cruel executioner and mortal enemy of overseas Chinese in Indonesia.\n\nThe people of the liberated areas express unanimous anger at this bloody debt of the US, Dutch, and Chiang massacre of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies! We express our deep condolences to the martyred compatriots. We lodge a serious protest with the US and Dutch imperialists, and call on compatriots across the country and overseas Chinese around the world to unite and support the Indonesian overseas Chinese. First, we must fight for the immediate restoration of freedom for the arrested overseas Chinese. At the same time, we hope that Indonesian overseas Chinese, in order to protect their own survival and rights, will unite with the Indonesian people to expel the forces of US and Dutch imperialism, and at the same time unite with the people in the motherland who are engaged in revolutionary war to overthrow the criminal rule of the Chiang bandits.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 记者评美荷蒋惨杀我侨胞　解放区人民悲愤抗议　号召全国同胞及全世界侨胞作印尼侨胞后盾\n\n1948-01-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　新华社记者评美荷蒋惨杀我侨胞\n  　解放区人民悲愤抗议\n  　号召全国同胞及全世界侨胞作印尼侨胞后盾\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】新华社记者评荷印侨胞被难事称：\n    印尼侨胞九百人，最近被荷兰帝国主义集体屠杀，尚有数千侨胞被拘禁在监狱里，至今生死不明。\n    这次血案是美、荷帝国主义和蒋匪政府联合演出的血腥记录。荷兰侵略者之所以胆敢制造此种滔天罪行，正是美帝和蒋匪鼓励支持其对印尼发动侵略战争的结果。\n    众所周知，蒋匪奉行卖国媚外的外交政策，一再公开诽谤与仇视印尼人民争取独立解放的斗争。即以最近为例：去年十一月间，蒋匪曾与美、荷等帝国主义勾结，阻止了印尼参加远东及亚洲经济会议。上月中旬，驻巴城蒋匪总领事馆曾唆使巴城总商会参加范。穆克主持下的西爪哇分裂运动会议。荷兰帝国主义在蒋匪全力支持下，就更加疯狂地展开以迫害全体华侨为目标的荷蒋联合攻势。同时必须指出：荷兰帝国主义对华侨的大屠杀已经不是第一次了，远在一九四○年，就有一万名中国苦力被集体杀戮的“红河大惨案”。两百年来，荷兰帝国主义曾不断挑拨中、印民族的民族仇恨。一九二六——二七年印尼大革命前后，被荷兰拘捕、驱逐、流放、惨杀的华侨青年就达千名以上。荷兰帝国主义就是印尼侨胞凶恶的刽子手和死敌。\n    解放区人民对这次美、荷、蒋屠杀荷印侨胞的血海深仇，表示一致的愤怒！对蒙难侨胞表示沉痛的哀悼。我们向美、荷帝国主义者提出严重抗议，并号召全国同胞及全世界各地侨胞一致起来作印尼侨胞的后盾，首先为被捕侨胞之立即恢复自由而斗争。同时希望印尼侨胞为了保障自己的生存与权利，与印尼人民团结一致，驱逐美、荷帝国主义势力，同时与祖国从事革命战争的人民团结一致打倒蒋匪的罪恶统治。"

The instructions pointed out: In distributing Party newspapers, in addition to forwarding subscriptions, attention must be paid to regulating distribution, reflecting distribution conditions and reader opinions to the newspaper offices at any time. The practice of only \"subscribing,\" \"collecting money,\" and \"delivering newspapers\" should be changed. The task of distributing the People's Daily to the districts must be well guaranteed to eliminate blank areas. All counties in the Taihang District and along the Pinghan-Baijin railway line, where newspapers can reach the post office within three days, should be distributed to the villages according to needs (other districts can also distribute to the villages if needed). The distribution of New Masses must be combined with rural postal services for promotion, combined with farmers' associations, and widely publicized using various methods to develop subscribers. Taihang has launched a campaign to promote 10,000 copies of New Masses, and all districts should make immediate efforts. In order to overcome errors in intermediate transmission and unclear cover rubbing, from February 1st, all bureaus will uniformly implement a \"Newspaper Transfer Inspection Form.\" If there are errors, they can be immediately resealed and sent out according to this comparison, without returning and delaying time. The instructions also called on postal workers to spare time to publicize the Outline Land Law, and to write articles for the newspapers about the people's reactions to the Outline Land Law and the construction of rural postal services. The instructions finally stated: All bureaus, stations, and offices should also pay attention to preventing landlords and rich peasants from using parcel remittances to transfer assets to protect the interests of hired and poor peasants during the land reform period.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 保证完成彻底平分　边区邮总指示加强书报发行\n\n1948-01-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　保证完成彻底平分\n  　边区邮总指示加强书报发行\n    【邮总消息】边区邮总顷指示各局站，在即将到来的平分土地运动中应加强书报发行工作。指示中指出：发行党报，除转递订发外，必须注意调剂掌握、随时向报社反映发行情况读者意见，只管“订报”、“收款”、“送报”的做法应改变。人民日报发行到区的任务要很好的来保证，消灭空白区。太行区及平汉白晋沿线各县，凡三天内报纸能到达邮局者，皆应根据需要发到村（其它区有需要者亦可到村）。对新大众的发行必须结合乡邮进行推销，结合农会，利用各种办法广为宣传，开展订户，太行已发起一万份新大众运动号召，各区应立即努力。为克服中途转递差错，封皮磨擦不清等，自二月一日起，各局一律实行“转递报纸检查表”，如有差错只要根据此对照，马上代封即能发走，不再退转误时。指示中并号召邮政人员，必须尽量抽空宣传土地法大纲，要随时把人民对土地法大纲的反映，与乡邮建设情形，给报纸写稿。指示最后称：各局站所并在注意防止土地改革期间地富利用包裹汇兑转移资财以保护雇贫利益。"

    "content": "International Week\n    (January 19th to 25th)\n    This week, more exciting good news came from Europe. In Britain, the movement against the Marshall Plan of enslavement is continuing to unfold. The British Communist Party continues to achieve significant victories in the trade union anti-communist re-elections instigated by the reactionary Labor authorities. In the re-election of the Transport and General Workers' Union, where Bevin made his name, several prominent members of the British Communist Party were re-elected to the executive committee of the union. In the re-election of the Manchester Trade Union Council, workers responded to the shameless clamor of certain reactionary Labor leaders in the union who forbade members of the British Communist Party from being elected by electing a member of the British Communist Party as chairman of the union. Similar things happened in the re-elections of many other local unions. The anti-communist activities carried out by the Labor authorities in accordance with the will of the \"Marshall Plan\" have not only been spurned by the broad masses of British workers, but have also aroused dissatisfaction and opposition within the Labor Party. Advanced elements such as Simpson from the Scottish branch of the Labor Party resigned in anger to join the British Communist Party. The above facts have demonstrated the growing prestige of the British Communist Party and the weakening of the Labor Party's mass base.\n    The facts of the week further show that the Labor government has resolved to further sell itself to the United States. The Labor authorities completely listen to the will of the American masters, revising their production plans and export plans \"to comply with the will of the Marshall Plan and American monopolists\" (TASS). The shipbuilding program, on which exports depend, has been greatly reduced. This traitorous policy has stirred up waves of resistance among the broad masses of workers, and the British working class is preparing to launch a widespread protest movement.\n    The democratic united front of the Italian working people is becoming more consolidated. Following the Sixth National Congress of the Italian Communist Party, the Italian Socialist Party, another major party of the Italian working class, held its 26th National Congress on the 20th of this month. In his report, the party's General Secretary Basso expressed his intention to abide by the agreement on unified action in all aspects between the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party. This reflects that this Socialist Party congress is a congress that further strengthens unity with the Communist Party. The close cooperation between the two largest parties in Italy, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, is a major guarantee that the Italian people's democratic movement will achieve victory.\n    The anger of workers in the western occupied areas of Germany against hunger is like a prairie fire. The strike wave, which has continued for two weeks in the British zone, has now quickly swept through the American zone. More than two million workers in Bavaria in the American zone have formally announced a general strike to protest the \"unbearable\" food rations. At the same time, the just calls and activities of the entire German people demanding peace and unity in Germany echo the strike struggles in the western occupied areas. The increasingly awakened strength of the German people has dealt a heavy blow to the conspiracy of American imperialism to split and enslave Germany.\n    The domestic democratic movement in the United States is also growing. The Progressive Citizens of America held its Second National Congress on the 18th, resolving to promote the establishment of a new party and support Wallace as a presidential candidate. Local unions of the CIO have also expressed their support for Wallace. According to Foster, a leader of the American Communist Party, \"the new third party will awaken millions of voters who are disappointed in the Democratic and Republican parties.\" This proves that the establishment of the new party reflects the demands and emotions of the broad progressive people of the United States, and also reflects their deep-seated hatred of the evil policies of the Democratic and Republican \"two-party system.\" At the same time, prominent figures in the American education and science communities recently announced the establishment of a \"Committee of One Thousand\" to fight for the abolition of the reactionary \"Un-American Activities Committee.\" Many scientists and educators, led by the famous physicist Einstein, have also spoken out against military interference in politics. Under the impact of the increasingly powerful American democratic forces, the reactionary American authorities were frightened and lost their composure, even taking off the so-called \"democratic\" sheepskin gloves and revealing a pair of blood-stained fascist poisonous hands, openly destroying democracy and human rights, and arbitrarily arresting Pittman and Jones, leaders of the American Communist Party. This is bound to add fuel to the growing people's movement in the United States, and the American Communist Party has called on the people of the whole country to rise up in support and fight to not replace the reactionary Attorney General.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国际一周  （一月十九日至二十五日）\n\n1948-01-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国际一周\n    （一月十九日至二十五日）\n    这一周，欧洲又传来了许多令人兴奋的好消息。在英国，反对马歇尔奴役计划的运动，正继续展开。英共在工党反动当局所策动的职工会反共改选中，继续获得重大的胜利。在贝文赖以起家的运输业及各业工人工会改选中，英共数名著名党员再度荣任该工会执委。在曼彻斯特工会委员会改选中，工人们以选举英共党员为该工会主席，来答复该工会某些工党反动头子不准英共党员当选的无耻叫嚣。在其它许多地方工会的改选中，也有类此的事情。工党当局秉承“马歇尔计划”的意志而作的反共活动，不仅遭到英国广大工人群众的唾弃，而且引起了工党内部的不满与反对。工党苏格兰地方支部的先进分子辛浦生等，愤而自动脱离该党加入英共。上述各项事实，已说明了英共威信的增长，和工党群众基础的越发削弱。\n    一周来的事实更加显示：工党政府已决心进一步向美国卖身投靠。工党当局完全听从美国主子的意志，修改其生产方案与输出计划，“以符合于马歇尔计划和美国垄断家们的意志”（塔斯社）。赖以出口的造船业计划，已经被大大削减。这种卖国政策已在广大工人中掀起了反抗的波澜，英国工人阶级正准备发动一个广泛的抗议运动。\n    意大利劳动人民的民主统一战线更趋巩固。继意共六次全国代表大会后，意工人阶级的另一大党社会党，于本月二十日举行了该党第二十六届全国代表大会。该党总书记巴苏在报告中，表示注守意共、社二党在一切方面统一行动的协定。这反映了这次社会党大会，是更进一步与共产党加强团结的大会。意大利两个最大政党共产党与社会党的密切合作，是意国人民民主运动必将取得胜利的重大保证。\n    德国西部占领区工人反饥饿怒火，有如燎原之势。英占区继续二周的罢工浪潮，现已迅速席卷美占区。美占区巴伐利亚的二百余万工人为抗议“不能再忍受”的粮食配给已正式宣布大罢工。同时，全德人民要求德国和平及统一的正义呼声与活动，也与西部占领区的罢工斗争交相辉映。德国人民日益觉醒的力量，已使美帝国主义分裂和奴役德国的阴谋受到沉重的打击。\n    美国国内的民主运动，也在增长中。美国进步公民协会于十八日举行了第二届全国代表大会，决议促使新党的建立，并拥护华莱士为总统候选人。产联各地方工会亦纷纷表示支持华莱士。据美共领袖福斯特说：“新的第三党将唤起数百万对民主、共和二党失望的投票者”。这证明新党的建立，是反映了美国广大进步人民的要求和情绪，亦反映了它们对民主、共和的“两党制”恶政，抱着如何深恶痛绝的态度。与此同时，美著名教育界与科学家最近亦宣布成立“千人委员会”，为取消反动的“非美活动委员会”而斗争。以著名物理学家爱因斯坦为首的许多科学家及教育界人士，也发言反对军人干政。美反动当局在日趋强大的美国民主势力的冲击下，惊惶失色，竟不惜脱掉了所谓“民主”的羊皮手套，露出了一双血淋淋的法西斯毒手，公开摧毁民主与人权，将美共领袖之一毕特曼及琼斯横加逮捕。这势将为正在增长的美国的人民运动火上加油，美共已号召全国人民起而声援并未撤换反动的司法部长而斗争。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[Taihang News] After rectification, the Huguan Nitrate Workshop's nitrate production in the last two months has exceeded the plan by half. The county originally had twenty nitrate workshops. Around August last year, the relationship between the nitrate workshops and the masses deteriorated, and they became disconnected from the masses' production in nitrate boiling. As a result, thirteen workshops were shut down. The remaining ones were on the verge of collapse because the masses were dissatisfied with the workshops' \"failure to pay for ash\" and refused to hand it over. The original plan for August and September was to boil 20,000 jin of nitrate, but only a little over 8,500 jin were produced. Later, in September, a mass-based rectification was carried out with full force, and corrupt managers like Gao Haiming, who held economic power, were removed. Everyone's enthusiasm for work became very high. Shen Ren, a technical worker who watched the pot at the Dongguanbi Nitrate Workshop, was originally a landlord and did not want to work hard. In September, sometimes he would boil three pots and not produce even one tael of nitrate, producing at most 200 jin a month. After the rectification in September, a poor peasant named Chang Shui was hired to learn how to watch the pot properly. He produced 800 jin a month, with each pot producing fifteen or sixteen jin of nitrate per day. Some workshops also implemented a work-point system with profit sharing. For example, the Jidian Nitrate Workshop previously gave everyone the same amount of work points, regardless of how much work they did, or even if they didn't work at all, so everyone's morale was very low, and they could only boil 200 jin a month. After rectification, everyone formulated a new system of recording work points, with fixed and flexible aspects, and a profit-sharing method: if a pot watcher could boil more than 30 jin of nitrate a day and also do odd jobs, they could earn twelve work points, with an extra half point for each additional jin and a half point deducted for each jin less. A nitrate scraper could earn ten work points for scraping six loads a day; transporting back four loads from three li away, or two loads from five li away, would also earn ten work points, with one extra point for each additional load scraped (one point deducted for each load less), and two extra points for each additional load transported (two points deducted for each load less). At the end of the month, profits were distributed according to work points. After this method was implemented, it greatly encouraged everyone's production enthusiasm, and the workshop boiled 700 jin of nitrate in one month. The relationship between the nitrate workshops and the masses has also improved since then. After the rectification of the Xincun Nitrate Workshop, they collected even three or five jin of ash, paying for it at the current price at any time. In the past, the government dispatched ash and special personnel urged its delivery, but it was still not enough. Now, the masses automatically deliver ash, and in addition to having enough for their own use, they also helped the Nanguan Nitrate Workshop with more than 2,000 jin of ash. Currently, since the rectification of all the nitrate workshops in the county, the number of pots has increased from twenty-six to forty-seven. Each pot now boils one hundred and seventy-six jin more nitrate per month than in the past (each pot boiled two hundred jin of nitrate in October). According to statistics for November and December, nearly 30,000 jin of nitrate were boiled, more than twice as much as in August and September, exceeding the original target by half, a total of more than 9,800 jin. The nitrate workers also earned an extra 108,000 jin of rice.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 壶关硝坊经过整顿产量超出计划一半\n\n1948-01-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　壶关硝坊经过整顿产量超出计划一半\n    【太行消息】壶关硝坊经过整顿后，最近两个月熬硝生产超出计划一半。全县原有二十座硝坊，去年八月前后，硝坊与群众关系恶劣，在熬硝上和群众生产脱节，因此，就有十三座停顿啦。剩下的因为群众不满硝坊“收灰不付钱”，拒绝交灰，也差一点要垮台，八、九两月原计划熬硝两万斤，结果只熬出八千五百多斤。以后在九月里，全力进行了群众性的整顿，并清除了掌着经济大权的贪污经理高海明等，大家干的劲头便很大。东关壁硝坊，原来看锅的技术工人申仁是个地主，不想好好干，九月份有时熬三锅还不产一两硝，一月顶多产二百斤；九月整顿后，雇贫常水掌学习好好看锅，一月就产到八百斤，每天一锅能出十五六斤硝。有的并实行了记工分红制度。比如集店硝坊，以前不管做活多少，甚至在一天不做活，也要顶工，大家情绪很低，一月只能熬二百斤。经过整顿，大家订出新的死分活记的记工制度和分红办法：看锅的一天如能熬出三十多斤硝，并捎带打杂，就可顶十二分工，多出一斤加半分，少出一斤减半分。刮硝工人一日刮六担顶十分，三里远运回四担，或五里远运回两担，都顶十分工，多刮一担多顶一分（少刮一担减一分），多运一担多顶两分（少运一担减两分）；月底按工分红。这个办法实行后，便大大鼓励了大家的生产积极性，该坊一月就熬出了七百斤硝。各硝坊和群众的关系从此也作了改善。辛村硝坊整顿后，三斤五斤灰都收，按时价随时开钱，过去是政府派灰、专人催送、还不够用，现在是群众自动送灰，除自己足够用外，还帮助了南关硝坊两千多斤灰。现全县硝坊自从整顿后，最近锅由二十六口增到四十七口，每月每口锅比过去多熬硝一百七十六斤（十月份每口锅熬二百斤硝）据十一、十二两月统计，共熬出近三万斤硝，比八、九两月超出两倍还多，超过原定任务一半，计九千八百多斤，硝工们也多赚米十万零八千多斤。"

Under the severe economic crisis, the reactionary Labor government still places all its hopes on American \"aid,\" which only makes the crisis worse. According to reliable sources, one of the main contents of the British economic plan, revised according to the will of the United States, is to greatly reduce shipbuilding and housing construction plans. British Economic Minister Cripps announced in mid-January: \"Steel allocations for shipbuilding will be reduced to four-fifths of last year's level,\" and \"shipbuilding plans must be cut.\" This policy of subservience to the United States by the Labor government has aroused protests from all parties in Britain. According to the Workers' Daily on the 22nd, British workers are increasingly bravely protesting against these government plans. Shop representatives and trade union leaders in major British ports and shipyards are preparing to launch a widespread protest movement. Ten thousand workers in Sunderland, who depend entirely on shipbuilding for their livelihood, sent a letter to Attlee expressing strong protest. The Workers' Daily published an article denouncing \"the Attlee government for going astray and completely catering to the will of the U.S. State Department.\" Harkster, chairman of the shipbuilding workers and technicians union in Scotland, strongly criticized Cripps' plan and declared: \"Soon, one-fifth of the shipbuilding workers will be unemployed.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 25th: (London) The British economic situation is becoming more serious. According to an announcement by the British Ministry of Commerce on the 20th, the total trade deficit in Britain in 1947 reached 591.2 million pounds (approximately 2.3648 billion U.S. dollars), an increase of more than 200 million pounds compared to 1946. This serious trade imbalance is making the British financial deficit increasingly large, forcing the Labor government to continue drawing on the nearly exhausted American loan. According to TASS news, Britain recently withdrew another 25 million pounds from the American loan. The press tycoon Kemsley's \"Daily Graphic\" revealed: \"Only 50 million pounds are left of the American loan, and it will be used up by the end of February.\" Therefore, \"panic and pessimism shroud Britain.\" At the same time, the British business newspaper \"The Economist\" stated on the 17th: \"Inflation in Britain is about to reach the edge of disaster.\" Along with the increasingly serious inflation comes the news of \"skyrocketing prices.\" \"Shoe prices will rise again in the short term,\" \"New sock prices take effect on January 19th,\" and \"Food and other daily necessities have greatly increased in price,\" these are the voices of resentment that British people are talking about everywhere.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 工党头子投靠美帝结果　英经济危机更厉害  人民提出强烈抗议\n\n1948-01-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　工党头子投靠美帝结果\n  　英经济危机更厉害\n    人民提出强烈抗议\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】综合报导：“工党政府对华尔街的投降政策，引起了英国国内危机的深化与严重的社会斗争”（苏联劳动报）。在深重的经济危机下，反动的工党政府仍把一切希望寄托在美国的“援助”上，这更使危机越陷越深。据确实消息，英国依照美国意志所修改的经济方案，其主要内容之一，便是大大缩减造船业与房屋建筑的计划。英经济部大臣克利浦斯于本月中旬宣布：“对于造船业的钢配给量，将减少至去年的五分之四”，“造船计划必须予以削减”。工党政府此种对美屈从政策，引起英国各方的抗议。据工人日报廿二日讯，英国工人越来越勇敢地抗议政府的这些计划。英各大港口与船坞的车间代表与工会领袖们，正准备发动广泛的抗议运动。完全依靠造船业为生的孙德兰的一万工人，致函向艾德礼提出强烈抗议。工人日报著文痛斥“艾德礼政府走入歧途，完全迎合美国务院的意志”。苏格兰某地的造船工人与技师职工会主席哈克斯特力斥克利浦斯计划，并宣称：“不久将有五分之一的造船工人失业。”\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】伦敦讯：英国经济情况更趋严重。据英商务部二十日宣布：一九四七年英国贸易的入超总额达五亿九千一百二十万镑（约二十三亿六千四百八十万美元）。较一九四六年激增二亿镑以上。此种贸易上严重的不平衡，使得英国财政的亏空越来越大，迫使工党政府不得不继续提取即将用完的美国贷款。据塔斯社消息：最近英国又从美国贷款中提取二千五百万镑。报阀克姆斯莱的“每日画报”透露：“美国贷款现在只剩下五千万镑，不出本年二月底就要花光了”。因此，“恐慌与悲观笼罩英伦”。同时，英企业家机关报“经济学者”于十七日载称：“英国的通货膨胀即将到达灾难的边缘”。随日益严重的通货膨胀而来的，是“百物暴涨”的消息，“鞋子短期内又将涨价”，“袜子新价一月十九日生效”，“食物与其他日用品又大涨特涨”，这些是英国人民到处谈论着的怨愤的声音。"

This has brought the number of strikers in the British and American-occupied territories of Germany to over 2.25 million, which the Associated Press calls \"the largest strike in Germany since the war.\" Factories in twenty-six cities and dozens of towns in Bavaria have stopped working, and all trains and military traffic in the state have come to a standstill. With the exception of water, gas, and food supplies essential for life, everything is at a standstill. Union leaders have warned the authorities that if their negotiations with the authorities regarding the resolution of the food crisis fail, then the anti-hunger strike will continue. The strike leaders also criticized the authorities for encouraging factory owners to hoard food and openly violate food laws. On the 23rd, 90,000 workers in Munich, the capital of Bavaria, held a grand demonstration at the former Hitler fascist parade ground, and marched in formation, shouting slogans such as \"Demand improved food rations\" and \"We can't take it anymore.\"\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 22nd: Berlin dispatch: Berlin democratic newspapers have revealed that under the guise of \"exporting,\" the British and American joint zone is carrying out large-scale plunder of Germany. In the entire year of 1946, 23 million tons of coal were exported from the joint occupation zone, priced at only ten U.S. dollars per ton, while American coal was sold on the European market for twenty U.S. dollars per ton. Last year, even more Ruhr coal was shipped to Britain, which has therefore profited more than 500 million U.S. dollars. In terms of timber, according to unofficial estimates, more than four million tons have been shipped to Britain, priced at only two U.S. dollars per ton, which is five and a half times lower than the world market price. Up to now, the British and Americans have taken more than 1.5 million tons of scrap metal from Germany, worth 45 million U.S. dollars, and this scrap metal is usually unpaid for. A large number of textiles from the joint occupation zone have also been shipped by the United States to other countries, earning hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars, while the United States is forcing its own inferior goods on Germany. In order to eliminate future competition from German industry and ensure new markets for British exports, Britain has seized a large number of the latest precision machines. The British government itself stated that \"these machines from 160 companies in the British occupation zone were not taken away as compensation.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 德国境内美国占领的地方　二百万工人总罢工\n\n1948-01-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　德国境内美国占领的地方\n  　二百万工人总罢工\n    【新华社陕北二十六日电】柏林讯：德境美占区巴伐利亚州，二十二日午夜爆发了二百万工人的二十四小时总罢工。使德境英美占区罢工人数激增至二百二十五万人以上，美联社称之为“这是战后德国最大的一次罢工”。巴伐利亚州二十六个城市及数十市镇的工厂都停止了工作，全州的火车及军用交通也陷于停顿。除了生活所必需的水、煤气及食物的供应外，一切都处于静止状态。工会领袖警告当局称：假如他们与当局关于解决粮食危机的谈判失败，那末，反饥饿罢工将继续不已。罢工领袖并抨击当局怂恿厂主囤积粮食，并公开违反粮食法令。巴伐利亚州首府慕尼黑九万工人于二十三日在前希特勒法西斯检阅场举行盛大示威，并列队前进，高呼“要求改善粮食配给”、“我们不能再忍受”等口号。\n    【新华社陕北二十二日电】柏林讯：柏林民主报纸纷纷揭露英美联合区在“输出”的烟幕下，对德国进行大肆掠夺。在一九四六年全年，从联合占区输出煤达二千三百万吨，每吨仅给价十美元，而美国煤在欧洲市场上出售每吨则为二十美元。去年鲁尔煤更大量的被运往英国，英国因此已获利五亿美元以上。在木材方面，据非官方估计，已有四百万吨以上被输往英国，每吨价格仅二美元，比世界市场价低五倍半。到现在为止，英美自德国运走的碎金属在一百五十万吨以上，价值四千五百万美元，这些碎金属是通常不付钱的。联合占区的大量纺织品，也被美国输往其它国家而获利数亿美元，同时美国却把自己的烂货强卖给德国。英国为了消除德国工业未来的竞赛，以保证英国出口的新市场，尽量攫取了大量最新式的精细机器，英国政府自己供称：“英占区一百六十家公司的这种机器，不是因赔偿而运走的。”"

    "date": "1948-01-28",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Cabinet's regular meeting on the 9th decided that the banks of the Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda zaibatsu would not be included in the scope of the \"Economic Decentralization Law.\" The Japanese Minister of Finance stated, \"The Japanese government fears that the collapse of such powerful banks would hinder Japan's economic recovery plan.\" A Xinhua News Agency reporter recently commented on this:\n　　The Japanese Cabinet clearly passed this decision under the instruction of MacArthur. This extremely reactionary decision nakedly exposes the shameful collusion between MacArthur and the Japanese zaibatsu, and also exposes that the purpose of the so-called \"Japanese economic recovery plan\" is primarily to restore the economic power of the Japanese fascist zaibatsu. Such a policy is a consistent policy of the American reactionaries. As early as last December, Republican Congressman Nolan of the United States clamored loudly, saying, \"The policy of eliminating excessive concentration of economic power in Japan is excessive and socialistic.\"\n　　The Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda banks are the nerve centers of Japan's four major zaibatsu. Through them and their affiliated companies, the four major zaibatsu control 70 percent of Japan's industry, the vast majority of import and export trade, and the majority of national savings. Their role in Japan is equivalent to that of Rockefeller's, Morgan's Chase (Citibank), Citibank, and Guarantee Trust Company in the United States. Today's announcement that they will not be included in the economic decentralization bill is an open declaration to continue maintaining the rule of the four major zaibatsu. It is already evident that the four major zaibatsu were the pillars of Japan's past wars of aggression. Mitsui Mining, Nippon Steel (Mitsui), Tokyo Shibaura Electric (Mitsui), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Nippon Yusen (Mitsubishi), Mitsubishi Steel, Mitsubishi Chemical, Sumitomo Metal, Sumitomo Communications, Sumitomo Chemical and other top ten Japanese companies, have always been supporters of Japanese wars. They dominated the so-called six major wartime key industries in Japan's military industry, such as aircraft, ships, steel, chemicals, coal, and light metals, and obtained huge profits. In addition, Ginjiro Fujiwara, managing director of Mitsui Oji Paper, served as an advisor to the Tojo Cabinet and Minister of Munitions in the Koiso Cabinet; Kiyoshi Gōko, president of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, served as an advisor to the Tojo Cabinet; and Masatsune Ogura, director of Sumitomo Gomei Kaisha, served as the top economic advisor to the Japanese stationed in the puppet state of Manchukuo. Today, these facts of heinous crimes are still vivid in our minds, and the blood of the martyrs who died for human justice and peace in World War II is not yet dry. The above-mentioned war criminals, although once arrested, have all been released. MacArthur, who is the representative of the Allied control of Japan, and Congressman Nolan and others have gone even further, frantically and openly tearing up the Potsdam Declaration, making people see more clearly the true colors of these war mongers. What they want to protect is not human justice and peace at all, but the money in the pockets of a few financial giants. If the four major Japanese zaibatsu were really dissolved, wouldn't the huge investments of Morgan's General Electric, Mellon's Westinghouse Electric, Rockefeller's Standard Oil, DuPont, and German chemical trusts in the electrical, military, and chemical enterprises operated by Mitsui and Mitsubishi be reduced to nothing?\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 战争贩子面目暴露得更清楚了　美帝勾结日本四大财阀  想恢复法西斯经济力量\n\n1948-01-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　战争贩子面目暴露得更清楚了\n  　美帝勾结日本四大财阀  想恢复法西斯经济力量\n    【新华社陕北二十六日电】东京讯：日内阁九日常会决定三井、三菱、住友、安田四大财阀银行不列于“经济分散法”范围之内。日藏相谈称：“日本政府因恐此种有力银行之倒闭，妨害日本之经济复原计划。”新华社记者顷就此评称：\n    日内阁显然是在麦克阿瑟授意之下通过此一决定的。这个极端反动的决定，赤裸裸的暴露了麦克阿瑟与日本财阀的可耻的勾结，也暴露了所谓“日本经济复原计划”的目的，是首先在于恢复日本法西斯财阀的经济力量。这样的政策，乃是美国反动派一贯的政策。早在去年十二月，美共和党议员诺兰就曾高声叫嚣说：“消灭日本经济过度集中现象的政策，是过火的与社会主义的。”\n    三井、三菱、住友、安田四大银行，是日本四大财阀的神经中枢。通过它们及其附属公司，四大财阀控制了日本工业的百分之七十，输出入贸易的绝大部分与国民储蓄的大部分。其在日本国内的作用，相当于洛克菲勒、摩根的大通（柴氏）银行、花旗银行与保证信托银行之于美国。今天宣布其不列入于经济分散法案之内，就是公开声明继续维持四大财阀的统治。而四大财阀之为日本历次侵略战争之支柱，已有目共睹。三井矿山、日本制钢（三井）、东京芝浦电气（三井）、三菱重工业、日本邮船（三菱）、三菱制钢、三菱化学、住友金属、住友通讯、住友化学等日本十大公司，一直是日本战争的支持者，它们支配着日本军需工业中飞机、船舶、钢铁、化学、石炭、轻金属等所谓战时六大重点工业，并获得巨额利润。此外，三井王子制纸会社常务理事藤原银次郎，曾任东条内阁顾问、小矶内阁军需大臣，三菱重工业会社社长乡古洁，曾任东条内阁顾问，住友合资会社理事长小仓正恒，曾任日本驻伪宁最高经济顾问。今天这些罪恶昭彰的事实犹历历在目，第二次大战中为人类的正义与和平而死去的烈士们，犹血迹未干。上述战犯虽经一度逮捕，都已全部释放。身为盟国管制日本代表的麦克阿瑟与国会议员诺兰之流，更进而丧心病狂地公开撕毁波茨顿宣言，使人们更看清楚了这批战争贩子的真面目。他们要的保卫本来就不是人类的正义和平，而是少数金融巨头口袋里的钱财。如果日本四大财团真的解散，那末摩根集团的通用电气公司、梅隆的集团威斯汀豪斯电气公司、洛克菲勒的美孚油公司、杜邦公司、德国化学托辣斯等在三井、三菱所经营的电气军火化学等企业中的巨额投资，不是化为乌有了？"

    "content": "Inspect Judicial Work\n    The Wu'an Detention Center had been striving to explore the class line, and its work had thus been improved to some extent. However, upon inspection, serious problems still exist; a large number of innocent people are still being detained. This is not just a problem of Wu'an County alone. The problems in those detention centers that still have undesirable work styles are worth exploring. Of course, this is not just a problem of detention center work, but mainly a problem of judicial work, because the detention center is directly led by the judicial section and receives the criminals handed over by the judicial section.\n    It must be pointed out that judicial work in various places is not all bad. Most of the staff are working hard to serve the people, but they inevitably have unconscious areas, which lead to results that are contrary to their wishes in their work.\n    Therefore, we request that all counties in the region conduct a judicial work inspection without exception. Check the class composition of the self-rehabilitated people, check the facts of the self-rehabilitated people's defendants from the class perspective, and from this check our position and viewpoint in handling cases. See if there are any phenomena of wronged masses in the judicial work of the democratic government, and dig out the problems to seek a thorough solution in coordination with the land redistribution movement.\n    Based on the experience of Wu'an, the most basic link in the class line of the detention center is to handle mass cases from a class perspective and not to wrong a single member of the masses. When we accept a mass case, especially when sending a member of the masses to a detention center, we must review it with a very serious attitude and never easily deprive a member of the masses of their freedom. Otherwise, we will commit a crime.\n    Therefore, the problem of the class line in the detention center cannot be solved from minor details. For example, if the people's position is lost and innocent people are locked up in the detention center, even if class distinctions are made and the lives of the masses are improved in the detention center, etc., although it is much better than doing nothing, it cannot solve the most basic problem. Because this is only a management issue for the self-rehabilitated people. Only after the class line in handling cases is resolved can the class line of managing self-rehabilitated people be raised to the main position of the detention center's work.\n    Here, a point of view should be criticized, that is, \"self-rehabilitated people manage themselves\" without class distinctions. Under the support of this view, some detention centers once appointed local bullies as life squad leaders because they treated all self-rehabilitated people equally. Therefore, in some detention centers, landlords and bullies who were self-rehabilitated people were very arrogant and even attempted to organize prison breaks. For these heinous guys, we must represent the masses and strictly manage them, and not let them manage themselves.\n    Finally, I hope that the results of the judicial work inspection in various places will be sent to this newspaper for publication.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 检查司法工作\n\n1948-01-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　检查司法工作\n    武安看守所，曾是努力摸索着走阶级路线的，因而工作得到一些改进。可是现在检查起来，还存在着严重的毛病，大量的无罪的群众还被羁押着。这不仅仅是武安一个县的问题，那些在实际工作中依然还有不良作风的看守所，其中的问题，是很值得发掘的。当然，这绝不仅仅是看守所工作的问题，而主要的是司法工作的问题，因为看守所是归司法科直接领导，接受司法科送交的案犯的。\n    必须指出，各地司法工作不全然是坏的，大多数的工作人员，都是在努力为人民服务的，但也不免有不自觉的地方，以致在工作中弄得事与愿违。\n    因此，我们要求全区各县，无例外的把司法工作检查一下，从自新人的阶级成份上检查，从阶级上检查自新人的被告事实，并从此检查我们处理案件的立场观点。看看在民主政府的司法工作中，有没有冤枉了群众的现象，把问题发掘出来，配合平分土地运动、求得彻底解决。\n    根据武安的经验来看，看守所的阶级路线，最基本的一环是从阶级性上处理群众案件，不冤枉一个群众。当我们接受一个群众案件，特别要把一个群众送进看守所的时候，必须以十分严萧的态度，加以审查，绝不许轻易的剥夺一个群众的自由。否则，我们就会犯罪。\n    所以，不能从枝枝叶叶上来解决看守所的阶级路线问题。比方，丧失了人民的立场，把无罪的群众关到看守所里，这样，即使在看守所里搞划阶级，改善群众的生活等等，虽然比不作要好得多，但它不能解决最基本的问题。因为这仅仅是自新人的管理问题。只有在解决了处理案件时的阶级路线以后，管理自新人的阶级路线才有可能提到看守所工作的主要地位。\n    这里应该批判一个观点，就是没有阶级性的“自新人自己管理自己”。在这种观点支持下，有的看守所，曾叫恶霸当生活大队长，因为凡是自新人，他们都一律同等看待。因此，有的看守所里，地主恶霸自新人，就十分狂妄，甚至企图组织越狱。对于这些罪大恶极的家伙，我们必须代表群众，严格的管理他们，而不能让他们自己管理自己。\n    最后，希望各地检查司法工作的结果，寄给本报发表。"

    "content": "[Our Newspaper's News] It is important to clarify the composition of newly reformed individuals and the nature of their crimes, and to see if the masses have been wronged. A reporter investigated the Wuan detention center. According to Director Gao, as of January 21, among the 77 newly reformed individuals, 12 were poor peasants, 23 were middle peasants (including one local tyrant), 12 were rich peasants, and 31 were landlords. Poor and middle peasants accounted for 45 percent of the total. This was the situation after the detention center checked their class status. Looking further back, the problems were even greater. In the last ten days of October last year, there were 28 poor peasant newly reformed individuals, 27 middle peasants, 13 rich peasants, and 26 landlords, totaling 94. Poor and middle peasants accounted for more than 58 percent. What crimes did they commit? According to Director Gao, based on their confessions: Xu Gengde (female), a poor peasant from Nancangjing Village, experienced a famine in 1943, and her family could not survive. Her husband, Cao Guo, left home without a word. Initially, someone in the village saw him in Nanyangyi, but there has been no news since. In 1945, Cao Baogui sued Xu Gengde, claiming she killed her husband. Cao Baogui was a landlord and a special agent, and also served as a militiaman. He was Xu Gengde's uncle. Earlier, he had given Xu Gengde's family eight mu of land. During rent reduction and debt liquidation, he wanted to reclaim the land, but Xu Gengde refused. This sowed deep hatred. The government initially did not clarify these matters and detained Xu Gengde for six or seven months. Later, after things were clarified, Xu Gengde was released. Upon returning home, she had nothing to eat or burn. Political Director Pei Chengcai took the opportunity to find her to sleep with, but she refused. The Political Director also gave her money, but she refused and even cursed him. From this, the Political Director hated her deeply. In June of last year, out of nowhere, cadres wanted to revisit \"old cases\" and insisted that Cao Guo was killed by Xu Gengde. They hung Xu Gengde seven times and beat her until she was black and blue, even threatening to burn her with a branding iron, forcing her to \"confess.\" Unable to withstand the torture, Xu Gengde made a false confession, even implicating her lover, Zhao Yu, saying that they both murdered Cao Guo. The cadres then convicted them of \"adultery and murder,\" confiscated Xu Gengde's property, and sent them to the detention center twice. Zhao Yu is also a poor peasant, who had nothing at home since childhood. He relied on doing small jobs for neighbors to eat from the age of eight or nine. Later, he went outside to mend pots for others for twelve years. He then repaired bicycles in a bicycle shop. After seven or eight years, he borrowed a house, rented four or five mu of land, and returned home to farm. He never managed to marry a wife. He and Xu Gengde had been lovers for eleven years. He was also imprisoned in the detention center for the first time because of Cao Baogui's accusation. Cao Baogui believed that Zhao Yu was behind Xu Gengde's refusal to let him reclaim the land. He was determined to punish him, but could not find any fault with him, so he went to the district cadres and said that Cao Guo was killed by Zhao Yu and Xu Gengde. (Last June, the village found out that Cao Baogui was a special agent, and he confessed to this, saying that Zhao Yu killing the man was \"not true, the man left.\") The district cadre questioned Zhao Yu for a while and then went to exhume the body. They dug for a morning without finding anything. They went again in the evening. At this time, Xu Gengde said to search Cao Baogui's body first, but Cao Baogui refused. As a result, two bones were found, but the masses did not say anything. Later, district cadre Li Yumin said, \"The bones are wrong, they are not human bones.\" At that time, Zhao Yu had already been sent to the detention center and had been detained for two months before being released on bail due to illness. After returning to the village, he did not dare to have a relationship with Xu Gengde. Last June, Xu Gengde's case was \"revisited.\" A district worker asked Zhao Yu about the murder, and Zhao Yu said that he did not kill anyone. They ordered him to take off his clothes and tied him up, put a branding iron next to him, and told him to \"confess.\" He was afraid and had no choice but to \"confess.\" In this way, he was sent to the detention center again. Another wrongly accused newly reformed individual is Zhang Lizhen, who is from Longwu Village and is 25 years old this year. His father used to beg for food and work as a hired laborer before renting hillside land in Xianling Village and settling down. Zhang Lizhen started working part-time for others at the age of twelve. When he was eighteen, his father died, and his mother remarried. From then on, he had no one and no home, and life was unbearable. At the age of twenty, he carved inkstones and made counterfeit money, but he failed, and the village reported him. He was sentenced to three months of imprisonment by the Third Special District Commissioner's Office. After returning to the village, he joined the army. Soon, he deserted. Unable to survive at home, he stole two dou of corn from Li Dongfang, and after being found out, he was fined a quilt. At the age of twenty-one, he couldn't survive in the village, so he went to the Northeast and worked in the Fengtian Iron Mine. Later, he made and sold pots in a pot factory. Later, he worked as a worker in a cigarette company. Later, he worked as a laborer on the street. In May of the year before last, he went around Shanghai, Nanjing, and Xuzhou before heading home. Passing through Zhangde, he was captured by the troops of the traitor Li Ying and detained for five days before being incorporated into Sun Dianying's troops. In September, he deserted in Huixian. He suffered in Tunzhuang, Tangyin, hauling water and feeding livestock for others. Last May, he went to Cuijiatian's shop to roll cigarettes for others for three months. After the village was liberated, he was sent to the Wuan detention center because he was an outsider. What laws did these people who have suffered all their lives break? The Judicial Section asked a lot of questions but did not base their judgment on these confessions, quickly clarify their cases, release them, and allow them to enjoy a democratic and free life. Some newly reformed individuals, such as Liu Tianmin, a poor man from Chengguan, have clear cases, and the Judicial Section has said they would release them. However, because he has no land or house, not even chopsticks, he is unwilling to go home and prefers to stay in the detention center. This is truly a desperate situation. The Judicial Section has not made any suggestions to the local government to solve his difficulties. These situations, where people are not being properly held responsible, are worth examining. It should be stated here that, with the deepening of the land reform movement, the comrades working in the detention center are also working hard to explore the path of the class line and have already achieved results. For example, due to class differentiation, the lives of poor and middle peasant newly reformed individuals have been improved, and the destructive activities of landlord newly reformed individuals have been cracked down. However, because the concept of class is not clear, and they did not first see if the masses had been wronged and quickly resolve these wrongful cases, as a result, so many people are still detained in the detention center, living a life without freedom. This should attract our greatest attention, and we should thoroughly inspect and improve judicial work.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 武安处理案件缺乏阶级路线　冤枉了不少中贫农　各地应结合平分检查司法工作　因为没有阶级性，贫妇案子半年没解决。　好心肠为人民服务立场不稳事与愿违\n\n1948-01-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　武安处理案件缺乏阶级路线\n  　冤枉了不少中贫农\n  　各地应结合平分检查司法工作\n  　因为没有阶级性，贫妇案子半年没解决。\n  　好心肠为人民服务立场不稳事与愿违\n    【本报消息】把自新人的成份弄清楚，罪名弄清楚，看是不是冤枉了群众，记者到武安看守所调查了一下。听高所长说：到一月二十一日为止，全所七十七个自新人当中，有十二个贫农，二十三个中农（里面有个恶霸），十二个富农，三十一个地主。算起来，贫农中农成份占百分之四十五。这还是看守所经过查阶级以后的情形。朝远处看看，问题就更多些。去年十月下十天，贫农自新人是二十八个，中农二十七个，富农十三个，地主二十六个，一满九十四个，贫农中农成份占了百分之五十八还多。他们犯的啥罪呢？高所长根据口供说：贫农徐更的（女），南丛井村人。民国三十二年，闹灾荒，家里时光没法过。丈夫曹国的，一声没吭，离开家远走高飞。开头村上有人在南阳邑见过他，后来就一直没有音信。民国三十四年，曹宝贵告了徐更的一状，说她害死丈夫。曹宝贵是地主，又是特务，还当着民兵，是徐更的的小叔。早先，当给过徐更的家八亩地。减租清债的时候，他要抽地，徐更的不让抽。这就种下了大仇。政府开头没有弄清这些事情，把徐更的扣了六、七个月。后来，事情总算是弄明白了，才把徐更的放了回去。徐更的回到家里，吃没吃，烧没烧。政治主任裴成才就趁空找她睡觉，她不愿意。政治主任又给她票子，她也顶回去了，还骂了政治主任一句。从这里，政治主任恨透了她。去年六月，不知道哪里来的风，干部们要翻“旧案”，硬说曹国的是徐更的害死的。把徐更的连吊了七回，打得浑身黑烂青，还要拿烙铁烫她，逼着她“坦白”。徐更的受不住这些刑罚，屈打承招，连她相好的赵玉也“咬”出来，说曹国的是她俩谋害的。干部们就给定了“通奸杀人”的罪名，把徐更的的家产一遭没收，二次把她俩送到看守所。赵玉也是贫农，从小家里啥也没有。八九岁就靠给邻家做小活吃饭。后来跟别人到外面补锅，一直干了十二年。又到自行车铺修车子。过了七八年，又借了房子，租了四五亩地，回家务农。一直没有娶起老婆。他和徐更的相好已经十一年。头一回蹲看守所，也是曹宝贵告的。因为曹宝贵认为徐更的不让抽地，是赵玉在里面捣的鬼。一心要整他，又找不到他的错处，就到区干部那里，说曹国的是赵玉和徐更的俩人害死的。（去年六月，村上查出曹宝贵是特务，他也坦白了这一点，说赵玉害死人“不实际，男人是走了”。）区干部问了赵玉一阵子，就去刨尸。刨了一早晨，没有啥。晚上又去刨。这时，徐更的说先搜搜曹宝贵的身上，曹宝贵不叫搜。结果刨出两根骨头，群众没吭气。后来区干部李玉民说：“骨头弄错啦，不是人骨头。”那时，赵玉早送到看守所了，蹲了两月，后来因为害病，才保出来。回村以后，没敢和徐更的发生关系。去年六月，徐更的的案子“翻”了。一个区工作员问赵玉害死人的事，赵玉说确实没有害死人。就叫他脱了衣服捆起来，旁边放上烙铁，叫他“坦白”。他害了怕，不能不“招承”。这样，又把他送进看守所。另一个有冤枉的自新人，叫张立祯，老家是龙雾村，今年二十五岁。他父亲要过饭，当过长工，后来才到仙岭村租种山坡地，安了家。张立祯十二岁就给人家打短工。十八岁上父亲死去，母亲改嫁。从这以后，人没人，家没家，生活没法。二十岁，因为刻砚瓦做假票子，没做成，村上报告了他，在三专署罚了三个月的徒刑。回村以后，参加部队。不久，开了小差。在家没法过，偷了李东方二斗玉茭，叫人查出来，罚了一条被子。二十一岁，他在村上实在过不下去了，下了关东，在奉天铁矿做工。以后到锅工厂做锅、卖锅。后来又到卷烟公司当工人。以后又在街上当小工。前年五月，从上海、南京、徐州转了一圈，朝家走。路过彰德，叫汉奸李英的部队查住，扣了五天，编到孙殿英的部队里。九月里开到辉县，他开了小差。流落在汤阴屯庄受苦，给人家挑水喂牲口。去年五月，又到崔家田的铺子里给人家卷烟，干了三个月，这村解放，因为他是外路人，就送到武安看守所。象这些受了一辈子罪的人，倒底犯了什么法？司法科问了一大堆口供，就没有根据这些口供，给他们作主，很快把他们的案子弄清楚，开销他们，还一直把他们开在看守所里，不让他们过民主自由的时光。有些自新人，案子已经弄得清清白白，司法科也说要放走他们，象城关的贫民刘田民。可是因为他家里没地没房，连个碗筷子也没有，他就不愿意回家，情愿蹲在看守所里，这真是万般无奈的作法。司法科也没有向地方上提意见，解决他的困难。这些对人民没有好好负起责任来的情形，值得好好检讨。这里应该说明，随着土地改革运动的深入，看守所的工作同志，也是在努力摸索着走阶级路线的，并且已经收到成绩。比方，由于划阶级，改善了贫农、中农自新人的生活，打击了地主自新人的破坏活动。可是因为阶级观念不明确，没有首先看一看是不是冤枉了群众，并很快解决这些冤枉案子，结果到现在还有这么多群众关在看守所里，过着不自由的日子，这应该引起我们最大的注意，彻底检查和改进司法工作。"

    "content": "The Peasant Movement in Democratic Southeastern Europe\nBy L. Konstantinovsky, translated by He Ge\n\nThe Political Life of Peasants in Southeastern Europe After the War\n\nNow let's look at the political side of the peasant issue in the Eastern European countries.\n\nIn these countries, Fascism was a deadly threat to the vast majority of the people. Therefore, even during the war, representatives of all strata of the people participated in the democratic groups of the Eastern European countries, with the exception of a small number of landlords, big capitalists, and financial oligarchs, because they put their private interests above the interests of the country. The construction of the new regime began with the active participation of the peasant masses. All propaganda about the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" and denial of the peasants in the Southeastern European countries are malicious deceptions. This can be seen by taking any Southeastern European country as an example.\n\nIn the new Yugoslavia, we say that the broad masses of peasants participated in the administration of the country, not only because there were countless peasant representatives in the highest political organs, but also because peasant parties participated in the People's Front. The characteristic of Yugoslav democracy is also that the people can exercise their rights through the rural and urban committees of the People's Front. The People's Front united the broadest progressive strata of the people. The core of the People's Front is the alliance of workers and peasants. Under such a political system, the peasant masses are guaranteed direct participation in politics.\n\nIn other Southeastern European countries, peasant parties also formed one of the most important elements in the democratic coalition government. Of course, this is no longer the decadent peasant party that represented the pre-war countryside. The development of the post-war peasant movement can be divided into three main trends.\n\nFirst, some old peasant parties were able to abandon their previous reactionary leadership and participate in the construction of the new democratic and progressive regime. Belonging to this category is, for example, the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union, which after the war stopped the activities of its former secretary Dimitrov and his supporters, and expelled Petkov and other conspirators who attempted to undermine the worker-peasant unity. Although Petkov, relying on foreign patronage, continued to carry out his sabotage activities and organized a new union under the same name, the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union remained loyal to the Fatherland Front and participated in the government. (Note: Petkov was sentenced to death last winter.)\n\nSecond, those outdated peasant parties, for various reasons, could not break away from their reactionary leadership, and thus took an almost openly fascist stance. They became the haven for the most frenzied, currently hidden reactionaries. But therefore, these parties also exposed their reactionary essence.\n\nThese two mutually influencing processes can be clearly seen in many countries. For example, in post-war Romania, the process of the cadres of the National Țărănist Party becoming participants in fascist terrorist organizations was very obvious. Maniu harbored former volunteers in his party. He became the head of the Romanian national reactionaries. As a result, the National Țărănist Party encountered a series of crises after the war. All the young members, led by Alexandru Rădulescu and Moțoiu, announced their secession from the party and formed a new Țărănist Party. Later, the group led by Dr. Lupu, vice-chairman of the Țărănist Party and one of the veterans of the Romanian peasant movement, as well as countless prominent members of the party and a large number of local organizations, also seceded from the party. In the November 1946 elections, Maniu's supporters suffered a crushing defeat even in many constituencies of Outer Transylvania, which they considered to be their stronghold.\n\nIn Poland, Mikołajczyk's party—the Polish Peasant Party—still calls itself a peasant party, but in reality it is an anti-people, reactionary party. It harbors all the reactionaries of the now banned reactionary parties, all those who do not want Poland to take the road of democracy. As a result, righteous democrats and the peasant masses abandoned the Polish Peasant Party. As early as last June, the magazine \"New Liberation\" appeared—the organ of the party opposing the Mikołajczyk faction. In the editorial of the magazine, it was pointed out:\n\n\"We represent those Polish peasant party members who live in the countryside and grow up in the countryside.\"\n\nSince the parliamentary elections, most of the party organs of the Polish Peasant Party have separated from Mikołajczyk. Now, even those Anglo-Saxon (Note: referring to the United States and Britain) observers who once enthusiastically supported Mikołajczyk cannot but admit that his influence in Poland is negligible, and say that they have lost all political interest in him.\n\nIn Hungary, the Smallholders Party took a democratic stance after the war and participated in the democratic coalition government. However, the Hungarian reactionaries, who had lost their legitimate political organizations, attempted to use the Smallholders Party to achieve their goals. And the right wing of the party was also very willing to take this path, opening the door wide to the fascists. As a result, the Smallholders Party became a breeding ground for enemies and conspirators of the Hungarian Republic.\n\nThe Hungarian reactionaries improved on the ancient \"Trojan Horse trick\" (that is, putting soldiers in the belly of a wooden horse to sneak into the enemy's city to fight; here it refers to the reactionaries sneaking into the Smallholders Party to oppose the people, using the Smallholders Party as their \"air raid shelter\"). But modern democratic forces have also improved their defenses. Now, guarding the fruits of democracy is the broad masses of the people. In front of the people, all conspiracies against the republic have been exposed, and the supporters of Kovács Béla and the friends of Horthy have revealed their true colors.\n\nFinally, the third trend that changed the political face of the post-war peasant movement is the emergence of new mass peasant organizations. At the same time as the collapse of the Romanian National Țărănist Party, the Ploughmen's Front organization led by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej appeared. Before the war, this organization only existed in two or three counties of Outer Transylvania. In the post-war environment, the peasant masses saw that they had nothing to expect from the Țărănist Party. Therefore, they began to join the Ploughmen's Front in large numbers. Now the membership of this organization exceeds 1.5 million. This is the best proof of the strength of the Romanian peasants.\n\n\"The largest majority in the country is the peasantry,\" said Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, the leader of the Ploughmen's Front and head of the Romanian government, \"However, it cannot fight alone. Now, the peasants are victorious in the alliance with urban workers and intellectuals. It is not quantity but strength that can win, and the source of this strength is the alliance between the peasants and the working class.\"\n\nThis also applies to the peasants in other Eastern European countries. The old peasant parties and their leaders who opposed the worker-peasant alliance and opposed the democratic system ended up being isolated from the peasant masses. In this way, they themselves embarked on the path of political destruction.\n\nThe Relationship Between National Independence and the Peasant Movement in Eastern Europe\n\nSpeaking of the new political role of peasants in Eastern European countries, it is necessary to pay special attention to an issue that occupies the most prominent position in the politics of these countries—the issue of the struggle for national independence. The radical land reforms that changed the fate of the peasants could be realized in Poland, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria, mainly because these countries resolutely defended their national sovereignty. The political activism of the peasant masses played no small role in this regard. As is well known, without the peasants, there is no and can be no national movement. In the current environment, without the active support of the peasant masses, the democratic regimes in Eastern European countries cannot solve the national problem and cannot successfully carry out the struggle for national independence.\n\nThe political backwardness of the peasant masses before the war and the economic weakness of these countries facilitated the offensive of foreign capital, which encountered the weakest resistance and the cheapest labor here. Everyone knows that the Germans planned to retain the backward agricultural characteristics of the Eastern European countries and turn them into appendages of industrial Germany. Within these countries, not only the landlord aristocracy was representative of this tendency. Almost all the leaders of the so-called \"traditional peasant parties\" were also supporters of foreign capital interests.\n\nThe plans of German imperialists have been shattered. But at present, there are other imperialist forces pursuing the same policies towards Eastern European countries. They are not without reason to fear that the elimination of the feudal remnants in these countries and the rapid economic development will leave foreign monopoly capital with no foothold. The political backwardness of the peasant masses and the reactionary consciousness of the leadership of the old peasant parties are important conditions for making these countries subject to foreign will.\n\nThe agents of German imperialism in Southeastern Europe openly clamored for preserving the backwardness of their countries. \"Cultivating machines are detrimental to the scenery,\" one of the leaders of the Yugoslav fascist organizations said. \"The peasant's religious ideas and ignorance will be our ideal,\" said the Romanian fascist leader. Now, the newly emerged foreign protectors of the Eastern European peasants are singing the same tune. Not long ago, one of the Turkish heads of international reaction, indignantly denounced the people's democracy, saying that it \"eliminated the uniqueness of agricultural countries.\" \"Land reform will lead to the decline of the Eastern European agricultural economy,\" a British reactionary newspaper \"predicted.\"\n\nUndoubtedly, the political backwardness of the peasant class plays a significant role in the Anglo-Saxon (US, UK) monopolists' plan to conquer Eastern European countries. This is why Maniu, Mikołajczyk, Petkov, and others can continue to receive foreign aid. But this fact is also one of the reasons why the peasant masses want to abandon the old peasant parties and their reactionary leadership.\n\nManiu and his supporters openly supported the unreasonable demands of foreign capital at the Paris Peace Conference, which aroused deep indignation among the Romanian peasant masses. And the fact that Mikołajczyk and his followers acted as agents of Anglo-American imperialism is also one of the main reasons for the disintegration of the Polish Peasant Party.\n\nIn the current environment, the peasant masses have realized the necessity of resolutely defending national sovereignty. The peasants know that without national independence, the new economic institutions of Eastern European countries cannot be consolidated, and land reform and all other new democratic measures cannot be completed. Therefore, the reactionaries' plans on this issue have also failed, and the progressive democratic policies have proved their correctness.\n\nThe above conclusion is very clear. In just a few years, we have witnessed the glorious process of the political awakening of the broad peasant masses in Eastern Europe. This process has great historical significance. The new political face of the peasants in Poland, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, and other countries proves the advantages of the democratic system established in Eastern European countries, and shows its progressive significance and great achievements. (To be continued)\n\n— Shanghai \"Era\" No. 213\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 民主东南欧的农民运动\nＬ·康斯坦丁诺夫斯基\n1948-01-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　民主东南欧的农民运动\n    Ｌ·康斯坦丁诺夫斯基作  何歌译\n    战后东南欧农民的政治生活\n    现在我们再看东欧各国农民问题的政治的一面。\n    在这些国家里，法西斯主义是最大多数人民的致命威胁。因此，还在战争的时候，各阶层的人民代表都参加了东欧国家的民主集团，只有少数地主，大资本家和金融寡头集团例外，因为他们把自己的私人利益看得高于国家的利益。新政权的建设工作一开始就在农民大众的积极参加下进行的。一切关于“工人专政”的宣传并否定东南欧国家的农民的言论都是恶意的欺骗。这拿任何一个东南欧国家为例都可看出来。\n    在新南斯拉夫，我们说广大的农民群众参加了管理国家的工作，这不但是因为在最高政权机构中有无数的农民的代表，而农民的政党则参加了人民阵线。南斯拉夫民主的特征也在于人民可以通过人民阵线的乡村和城市委员会而行使自己的权利。人民阵线联合了最广泛的进步的人民阶层。人民阵线的核心就是工农联盟。在这样的政权机构下，农民大众获得了直接参政的保障。\n    在其他东南欧国家里，农民的政党也形成了民主联合政府中的最重要的分子之一。当然，这已经不是代表战前农村的腐朽的农民党了。在战后农民运动的发展中可以分成三种主要的倾向。\n    第一种，某些旧的农民党能够抛弃掉先前的反动领导机构而参加民主进步的新政权的建设工作。属于这一类的有，譬如，保加利亚农民联合会，它在战后停止了前任秘书狄米特洛夫及其拥护者的活动，开除了皮特柯夫及其他冀图破坏工农团结的阴谋分子。虽然皮特柯夫仗恃外国的庇护，继续进行其破坏活动。并且以同样的名称组织了新的联合会，但保加利亚农民联合会始终忠于祖国阵线，并且参加了政府。（按：皮特柯夫已于去年冬被判处死刑。）\n    第二种，那些陈旧的农民政党，由于种种原因不能脱离自己的反动领导机构，因而走上了几乎公开的法西斯的立场。它们成了最疯狂的，目前不能公开出现的反动分子的避难所。但因此，这些政党也暴露了自己反动的本质。\n    这两个互相影响的过程，可以在许多国家里清楚地看到。例如，在战后的罗马尼亚，民族柴朗党的干部变成法西斯恐怖组织的参加者的过程，是非常明显的。曼纽在自己的党内藏匿了以前的志愿军。他成了罗马尼亚全国反动派的首脑。结果，民族柴朗党在战后便遭遇了一连串的危机。以亚历山大列斯古和莫陀兰为首的全体青年党员宣告脱离该党，组成了新的柴朗党，及后柴朗党副主席和罗马尼亚农民运动元老之一，鲁普博士所领导的集团以及该党的无数著名党员和大批地方组织，也都纷纷脱离了该党。在一九四六年十一月的选举中，曼纽的拥护者甚至在他们认为是自己的堡垒的外锡尔凡尼亚的许多选区内都遭遇了惨败。\n    在波兰，米柯拉席克的党——波兰农民党——仍旧自称为农民的政党，但实际上它是一个反人民的反动政党。这里面收容着现在被查禁的反动政党的一切反动人物，一切不愿让波兰走上民主道路的人物。结果，正义的民主人士和农民群众都抛弃了波兰农民党。还在去年六月，就出现了“新解放”杂志——该党反对米柯拉席克派的机关刊物。在该杂志的社论中指出：\n    “我们代表那些生活在农村中和生长在农村中的波兰农民党员。”\n    自国会选举后，波兰农民党的大部分党机构与米柯拉席克脱离了。现在，甚至那些曾经热烈支持过米柯拉席克的盎格鲁撒克逊（按：指美英）的观察家也不能不承认，他在波兰的影响是微乎其微的，并且说，对他已失去了一切政治兴趣。\n    在匈牙利，战后小地主党采取了民主的立场，并且参加了民主联合政府。然而，失去了自己的合法政治组织的匈牙利反动派却企图利用小地主党来达到他们的目的。而该党右翼也很愿意走这条路，他们向法西斯分子大开方便之门。结果，小地主党便成了匈牙利共和国的敌人和阴谋分子的渊薮。\n    匈牙利反动派改善了古代的“特洛伊木马计”（就是把兵装在木马肚子里混进别人的城中作战；这里是指反动派钻进小地主党中反对人民，把小地主党当他们的“防空洞”）。但是现代的民主力量也改善了防御方法。现在，守卫着民主果实的是广大的人民。在人民面前，一切反对共和国的阴谋都被揭发出来了，柯华契·贝拉的拥护者和霍尔第的朋友们都显露了原形。\n    最后，改变了战后农民运动的政治面目的第三种倾向就是新的群众性的农民组织的产生。与罗马尼亚民族柴朗党崩溃的同时，出现了山格罗柴领导的火犁阵线的农民组织。战前，这个组织只存在于外锡尔凡尼亚的两三个县份里。在战后的环境中，农民大众看到他们从柴朗党那里已没有什么可以期待的。因此，开始大批地加入了火犁阵线。现在这个组织的会员数额已超过一百五十万人。这是罗马尼亚农民力量的最好的证明。\n    “国内的最大多数是农民”，火犁阵线的领导者和罗马尼亚政府首领格罗柴说道，“然而，它不可能独自进行斗争。现在，农民是在与城市工人和知识分子的联合中获得胜利的。能够得胜的不是数量而是力量，而这种力量的来源就是农民与工人阶级的联盟。”\n    这也适用于东欧其他国家的农民。反对工农联盟，反对民主制度的旧农民党及其首领们结果是脱离了农民群众而孤立起来。这样，他们自己走上了政治毁灭的道路。\n    民族独立与东欧农民运动的关系\n    说到东欧各国农民的新的政治作用，必需特别注意在这些国家的政治中占着最显著地位的一个问题——民族独立斗争的问题。那改变了农民命运的急进的土地改革能够在波兰、南斯拉夫、罗马尼亚和保加利亚国内实现，主要是因为这些国家坚决保卫住了自己的民族主权。农民大众的政治积极性在这方面起了不小的作用。如所周知，没有农民就没有也不可能有民族运动。在目前的环境中，没有农民大众的积极支持，东欧国家的民主政权是不能解决民族问题的，不能顺利进行民族独立斗争的。\n    战前农民群众的政治落后和这些国家的经济弱点便利了外国资本的进攻，后者在这里遇到了最软弱的抵抗和最便宜的劳工，大家都知道，德国人曾计划保留东欧国家的落后的农业特性，使它们变成工业德国的附属地，在这些国家的内部，不仅地主贵族们是这种倾向的代表。几乎一切所谓“传统的农民党”的首领们也都是外国资本利益的拥护者。\n    德帝国主义者的计划已经破灭了。但是在目前，还有其他的帝国主义力量对东欧国家推行着同样的政策。它们并非没有理由地要害怕，这些国家的封建残余的肃清和迅速的经济发展将使外国独占资本无立足之地。农民群众的政治落后，旧农民党的领导机构的反动意识，是使这些国家服从外国意志的重要条件。\n    德帝国主义在东南欧洲的代理人曾公开叫嚣，赞成保留自己的国家的落后性。“耕种机有损风景”，南斯拉夫法西斯组织的首领之一这样说过。“农民的宗教思想和无知无识将是我们的理想”，罗马尼亚的法西斯首领说。现在，新出现的东欧农民的外国保护者也唱着同样的曲调。不久前国际反动派的土耳其首脑之一，愤愤地指责人民的民主主义，据说它“消灭了农业国家的独特性”。“土地改革将导致东欧农业经济的衰落”，英国反动报纸这样“预言”。\n    无疑的，农民阶层的政治落后性在盎格鲁撒克逊（美、英）的独占资本家征服东欧国家的计划中起着重大的作用。这就是曼纽、米柯拉席克、皮特柯夫等人还能继续获得国外援助的原因。但这个事实也正是农民大众要抛弃旧农民政党及其反动领导的原因之一。\n    曼纽及其拥护者在巴黎和会时公开支持外国资本的无理要求，这引起了罗马尼亚农民大众的深刻的愤慨。而米柯拉席克及其党徒做了英美帝国主义的代理人这个事实，也是波兰农民党瓦解的主要原因之一。\n    在目前环境中，农民大众已经觉悟到坚决保卫民族主权的必要。农民们知道，没有民族的独立，东欧国家的新经济机构就不可能巩固，土地改革及一切其他新民主措施就不可能完成。因此，在这个问题上反动派的打算也落空了，而进步的民主政策则证明了自己的正确性。\n    上面的结论是很清楚的。不过几年的时间，在我们的眼前就经历了东欧的广大农民群众的政治觉醒的光辉过程。这个过程具有重大的历史意义。波兰、南斯拉夫、保加利亚、罗马尼亚等国农民的新的政治面目，证明了在东欧国家中确立的那种民主制度的优点，显示了它的进步意义和伟大成就。（续完）\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——上海“时代”二百一十三期"

    "content": "[Comprehensive report from this newspaper by Xinhua News Agency] The Jiaodong People's Liberation Army, which has won many victories, eliminated more than 60,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the last four months of last year. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits have been completely squeezed into a small area along the Beihai coast. Beginning in August of last year, after the Chen Su troops marched west, Chiang Kai-shek pieced together six divisions and launched a fierce offensive against the Jiaodong Liberated Area. The Xu Tan army, which remained in Jiaodong, opened its pocket and allowed this mad dog to enter, while lightly turning to the flanks and repeatedly inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. In more than a month, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits lost more than 10,000 men in exchange for a dozen or so empty cities. The enemy's blind offensive suffered a severe blow. After October, our army eliminated more than 10,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits along the Jiahe River, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were forced into a full defensive posture. At this time, our counter-offensive army took advantage of the victory to recover Yexian and Zhucheng, and even advanced into Yantai City for a time. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Muping, Qixia, Zhaoyuan and other counties were also frightened and abandoned their cities and fled, and the vast lost territories of Jiaodong were quickly recovered by us. In November and December, our army continued to win several major victories in Haiyang, Laiyang and other places, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits who invaded Jiaodong were finally driven to the narrow and long area of Longkou, Huangxian, Penglai, Fushan and Yantai on the Bohai coast. The time when they will all be annihilated is not far away. The Eastern Front Corps Command of the East China People's Liberation Army summarized the detailed battle achievements of the great victory in Jiaodong in these four months (September to December) as follows (the previously announced annihilation of 300,000 enemies in East China in one year does not include this battle record): (1) A total of 63,067 enemy regular and irregular troops were killed, wounded, or captured, including 21,790 captured alive.

Including Jin Mengrong, deputy commander of the 211th Brigade, Li Zhengxi, commander of the 2nd Regiment of the Brigade, Zhang Xiliang, deputy commander of the 3rd Regiment, Li Kewen, deputy commander of the 475th Regiment of the 159th Brigade of the 64th Division, Xiao Fengming, commander of the 170th Regiment of the 57th Brigade of the 74th Division, and others.

    "content": "I am Xu Geng from Nan Congjing, Wu'an, and am twenty-eight years old this year. My family of origin currently has three people. In the past, we rented land, but after the liberation, we have twelve mu of land and one mu of graveyard. My husband's family is from this village. When I married Cao Guo, his family had no land. They had four south-facing rooms and three main rooms, which were mortgaged outside. We lived in two rooms, which had holes and were only worth one and a half rooms. My husband's mother died when he was eight, and his father died when he was sixteen, so he had no way to make a living. I did odd jobs, and my husband worked as a long-term worker for his aunt's family. After a year, he became very weak, and they didn't keep him, so he returned home. He worked in a restaurant for a year, but it didn't work out. Uncle Cao Fenglin (Cao Baogui's father) asked him to endure suffering. He only gave him two mao a year. After a year of suffering, he returned home again. Later, I rented Cao Baogui's eight mu of land myself. During the rent reduction and debt clearing, he wanted to take it back, but I didn't let him because it wasn't long enough. I had just planted it, but he still took it back. This planted the seeds of hatred.\n\nDuring the liberation, I received two thousand yuan the first time. Last winter, I was given ten jin of wheat for relief, while some households were given twenty or thirty jin. The second time, I was given more than twenty jin of mung beans, eight chi of willow cloth, and some old needles and thread. This time, I was given a score of five, which was the lowest score. The highest score was forty-something. After I was deducted, all my things were confiscated by the village cadres. Their intention was to make it impossible for me to live, so that I would have to find a partner.\n\nLet me talk about my husband. When I was eighteen or nineteen years old, my husband left without a word to join the army. After a few days, he came home once to change his military uniform. The first year, due to bad harvests, he came back again. I heard that the army didn't want him. Later, Tian Liu from our street led him back to the army. In July of the following year, he returned home after being discharged. Unable to make a living at home, he went to the fields to pick wild vegetables. He said, \"If I don't have anything to eat, I will starve to death at home.\" In August of the thirty-second year of the Republic of China, when there was a famine, I went to the fields to harvest grain and asked him to watch the door. When I came back, he was gone, probably having gone with the army. I went to Cao Fenglin's house, but he wasn't there. More than a month later, Cao Fengshan told me that my husband had gone to his aunt's house in Bei Congjing and left from there. His aunt had also given him ten yuan. After that, there was no news.\n\nIn May of the thirty-fourth year of the Republic of China, Cao Baogui filed a lawsuit, saying that I had killed my husband. Because of the land withdrawal, he had a grudge against me. He was a landlord and a special agent. This year, the village killed him. At that time, I didn't know these things. He was still a militiaman. He sent me to the detention center, where I stayed for six or seven months, and was released in December.\n\nAfter returning home, I went to my aunt's house in Bei Congjing to ask about my husband. My aunt said, \"He came here, but I don't remember which year or date it was.\" My aunt's daughters chimed in, saying, \"Brother 'Jian Guo' was sitting at the south wall door, looking very thin.\" My aunt quickly said, \"How can children remember so clearly!\" I said, \"I'm not messing with Cao Baogui, I want to find out where he went, whether he's dead or alive, I'll be satisfied if I find him.\" My husband is my aunt's (not a blood aunt) nephew, and Cao Baogui is also her nephew. One had no power, and the other had power, so my aunt said these words.\n\nSince I couldn't find any news about my husband, I didn't dare to have any more relationships with Zhao Yu (my lover), because I was afraid of being tortured. At this time, the village arranged for me to remarry to Li Tianhe. I didn't want to because he was too young. Then, the political director Pei Chengcai took advantage of my difficult life and became intimate with me. The political director is over forty years old and has only one eye. His family has four people and now has forty-something mu of land, two mules, and hires a long-term worker. He likes to mess around with women. Because of this, his wife tried to hang herself. He's still messing around with a loose woman. He wanted to have a relationship with me, but I didn't agree. He threw me money, and I scolded him for being shameless and gave the money to his wife. Later, the masses and cadres discussed and asked me to remarry. I talked to the village chief: \"I can't avoid leaving, I agree to remarry Zhao Yu.\" The village chief didn't say anything, but the political director was not satisfied and said that if I was going to leave and marry Zhao Yu, he would find my mistakes. This is what the political director's wife told me, she confronted me about this. In April or May of this year, Little Song Yi, who was herding sheep, asked me to marry Zhao Yu, but I didn't dare to mention it. The village also introduced me to several others, but I didn't agree.\n\nIn June of this year, they detained me again. I was detained for five or six days. On the 23rd, they held a meeting to question me about killing my husband. The director of the Farmers' Association and other cadres and militiamen interrogated me for a while, saying that if I said my husband was in Nanyangyi, I would have to bring him up. If I didn't admit to killing him, they would beat me to death. I didn't admit it, so they hung me up seven times in a row, took off my upper body clothes, and beat me until I was black and blue all over. Finally, they threatened me with a branding iron, and I falsely confessed. They also asked me to confess the location of the body. At first, I admitted that the donkey bones that were dug up that year were my husband's body, but that wasn't enough. So I had to say that Zhao Yu and I killed my husband together, and Zhao Yu buried the body. The cadres wrote down my confession, and my family's belongings were confiscated, even my sister's 7,250 yuan was taken away, which was counted by the political director.\n\nAfter I was detained by the village, Mi Gui, the village chief's nephew, was on guard. I said to him, \"Go tell the village chief (Pei Yuezhong) and ask Lao Gui Fang, and he will know the whereabouts of my husband.\" He said, \"I know, Lao Gui Fang told the village chief's wife that it was unjust for you to kill your husband. The village chief sighed after hearing this. His wife said to Lao Gui Fang, \"Can't you testify?\" Lao Gui Fang said, \"I dare to say it if someone asks me, but I don't dare to say it at the meeting, I'm afraid.\" This is the truth.\n\nThere was also a militiaman on guard named Jia Ershuang. He said that I was stubborn. He said, \"It'll be fine if you find a partner. There are now one hundred and thirty-seven single men, from eighteen to thirty-five years old. You can be with whoever you want.\" But even if I leave, I don't want to wear the hat of a murderer.\n\n(Editor's note: This material was written based on Xu Geng's confession last year.)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 贫雇妇女徐更的控告坏村干裴成才\n\n1948-01-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　贫雇妇女徐更的控告坏村干裴成才\n    我是武安南丛井人，今年二十八岁。娘家现在有三口人。过去租种地，翻身以后，有了十二亩地，一亩坟地。婆家是本村，我嫁曹国的的时候，他家里没有地。有四间南屋，三间堂屋、当在外边。俺住了两间屋，有窟窿，只顶一间半。男人八岁死了娘，十六岁死了爹，没法过。我做营生，男人给姑姑家当长工，当了一年，身体很软，人家不收，他就回了家。在饭铺站了一年，不行。叔公公曹凤林（曹宝贵的爹）叫他去受，一年只给两毛钱，受了一年，又回了家。以后我自己当下曹宝贵的八亩地，减租清债的时候，他要抽，我不叫抽，因为不够年限，我刚种上，人家还是抽回去了。就这样还种下了仇气。\n    翻身当中，我头回分了两千元。去年冬天救济了我十斤麦子，有的户就救济了二、三十斤。第二回分给我二十多斤绿豆，八尺柳条布，还有些破旧针线。这回给我定的是五分，是最少的分数。顶高的是四十来分。我被扣以后，东西都叫村干部没收了。他们的用意是叫我没法过，不能不找对象。\n    说说俺男人吧。我十八、九岁的时候，男人没哼气，出去当了兵。走了几天，回家一趟，换了军装。头一个赖年景，又回来了，听说是部队不要他。后来俺街田流的又把他领回部队。第二年七月，退伍回来，在家没法，到地里拾剌菜。他说：“我没吃的，在家会饿死。”三十二年八月里，正闹灾荒。我到地里割谷，叫他看门，我回来，不见他了，大概是跟军队走了。我找到曹凤林家，没有。过了一个多月，曹凤山对我说，俺男人到了北丛井姑姑那里，就从那里走了。姑姑还给了他十元钱。以后就没有音信了。\n    民国三十四年五月，曹宝贵告了一状，说我害死男人。因为抽地，他和我有仇气。他是地主，又是特务，今年叫村上捣死了。那时不知道这一些，他还当着民兵。把我送到看守所，住了六、七个月，十二月才放出去。\n    我回家以后，到北丛井姑姑家问过俺男人，姑姑说：“过秋的时候，是从这里走的。”姑姑家的媳妇也这样说。\n    后来有一天，我和老桂芳闲扯，他说：“三十三年四月初十，我在南阳邑见过他（俺男人），拉了一个红骡子，穿着绿军装，叫我喂头口。开头我不理，他叫了我声老桂芳，我一看是他，瘦得不象样子。我说：‘小国的，你去姑姑家喂罢。’就带他到了姑姑家。”这个事，在我被扣的时候，老桂芳在街上说。老桂芳是翻身户，在南阳邑住长工，三十四年五月才回家，和副村长裴正富住在一个院里。\n    去年正月，我到南阳邑去打听男人的消息。姑姑说：“来是来了，不记得是哪一年，哪个日期了。”姑姑家的小女们插嘴说：“见国”的哥哥在南墙门坐哩，瘦得不象人样。”姑姑赶紧说：“孩子们怎记得这样清！”我说：“我不是和曹宝贵弄事，我想打听人去了哪里，不管死活，我找到就满意了。”我男人是姑姑（不是亲姑姑）的侄儿，曹宝贵也是她的侄儿，一个没法，一个有法，姑姑才说了这些话。\n    俺男人的消息打听不着，我也没敢再和赵玉（我相好的）发生关系，我怕动刑。这时，村上给我说合，叫我改嫁给李天何。我嫌他太年青，不愿意。接着，政治主任裴成才趁我生活艰难，和我亲近。政治主任四十多岁，一个眼。他家四口人，现在有四十来亩地，两个骡子，雇着一个长工。他好搞破鞋，因为这，他女人上过吊，到现在他还搞一个破鞋。又要和我搞关系，我不同意。他丢给我票子，我骂他不要脸，又把票子送给了他老婆。后来，群众、干部酝酿，叫我改嫁。我找村长谈：“我躲不开走，我同意改嫁给赵玉”村长没啥，政治主任不满意，说我要外走给赵玉，就找我的错误，这是政治主任老婆对我说的，她和我对事。今年四五月里，放羊的小宋义叫我和赵玉结婚，我不敢提了。村上还给我介绍了几个，我都没答应。\n    今年六月，又把我扣起来，扣了五六天，二十三日开大会，问我害死男人的事情。农会主任等干部、民兵审问了一阵，说我要是说俺男人在南阳邑，就得叫上来。不承认害死，就打我一死。我不承认，就把我连吊了七次，脱了上身衣裳，打得我浑身黑烂青。最后又拿烙铁威胁我，我假承认了。还叫我坦白尸首，开头我承认那年刨出的驴骨头，就是男人尸首，还不行，这才硬说赵玉和我一块害死的男人，尸首是赵玉埋的。干部们写下口供，把我家的东西没收了，连俺妹妹的七千二百五十块钱也捎带走了，这是政治主任点过的。\n    我叫村上扣起来以后，村长的侄儿米桂站岗，我和他说：“你去告诉村长（裴月中），问问老桂芳，就知道俺男人的下落。”他说：“我知道，老桂芳对村长老婆说过，说你害死男人是冤屈的。村长听罢叹了口气。他老婆对老桂芳说：“你不能去证明？”老桂芳说：“有人问我我敢说，叫我到大会上说，我不敢，害怕。”这是实事儿。\n    还有一个站岗的民兵，叫贾二双，他说我脑筋死。他说：“找个对象就没事了。现在光棍汉有一百三十七个，十八到三十五岁的，想跟谁对象，就跟谁对象。”可是，我就是外走，也不愿意带杀人的帽子。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    （编者按：这个材料是根据徐更的的去年口供写成的。）"

The results of the battle are currently being investigated. The destruction of the 26th Division is the fourth complete division annihilated since the start of our Northeast Winter Offensive. Xinlitun is located more than 200 li east of Shenyang, and is an important connecting point for the two railways of Da (Hushan)-Tong (Liao) and Xin (Litun)-Yi (County).\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th] After the Liberation Army recovered the vast rural areas of Xinmin County in the Winter Offensive, it immediately assisted the local masses in establishing democratic government and local armed forces, launching a vigorous grain distribution movement. Democratic governments have been universally established at the county, district, and village levels, and militias have been established in each village. The local armed forces in the county and districts have also developed rapidly, with farmers seizing 700 guns from landlords. Poor peasant leagues have been established in 117 natural villages in the sixth, seventh, eighth, and third districts of the county, and class division is being further carried out in preparation for equal distribution of land. The poor peasants in more than 40 villages in the south of the county have recently launched accusations of suffering, distributing grain and windfall wealth, and seizing more than 400 guns from landlords. South of the Beining Railway, the masses prepared bags to distribute grain as soon as they saw our army. When our army was fighting in Manduhu, nearly 2,000 farmers in the area automatically distributed the grain of Nationalist landlords. Many farmers automatically requested to join our army. In helping the masses distribute grain, the Liberation Army resolutely implemented the policy of uniting with middle peasants (such as not taking grain from those at or below the level of middle peasants) and protecting industry and commerce. Another report: The Red East Sub-district Battlefield Work Group went deep into the Nationalist-occupied areas with the army to mobilize the masses. In mid-November of last year, it mobilized more than 30 villages including Daziying between the Jinzhou-Chengde Railway and the Daling and Xiaoling Rivers, and the farmers distributed more than one million jin of grain and a large amount of other windfall wealth. On average, each person received 300 jin of grain, two pieces of clothing and bedding, two farm tools, and one head of livestock. Poor peasant groups also began to be established during the distribution of grain and windfall wealth.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北冬季攻势又获一大胜利　新立屯歼守敌一师　新民县已建立民主政权分粮食给雇贫坚决贯彻团结中农保护工商业的政策\n\n1948-01-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北冬季攻势又获一大胜利\n  　新立屯歼守敌一师\n  　新民县已建立民主政权分粮食给雇贫坚决贯彻团结中农保护工商业的政策\n    【新华社东北前线二十七日急电】东北人民解放军昨天上午全部歼灭蒋匪战略要点新立屯守敌四十九军二十六师，战果正清查中。二十六师的覆没为东北我冬季攻势展开后被歼灭的第四个整师。按新立屯东距沈阳二百余里，系大（虎山）通（辽）与新（立屯）义（县）两铁路重要连接点。\n    【新华社东北二十七日电】解放军在冬季攻势中收复新民县广大乡村后，即协助当地群众成立民主政权与地方武装，掀起猛烈的分粮运动。该县县、区、村民主政权已普遍建立，各村并均建立民兵，县区地方武装也迅速发展，农民收缴地主枪支达七百支。该县六、七、八三区一百十七个自然村都已成立贫雇团，并进一步进行划分阶级，准备平分土地。该县南部四十余村贫雇，最近也都掀起诉苦，分粮分浮财，收缴地主枪支四百余支。北宁路南，群众一见我军就拿口袋准备分粮。我军在满都户作战时，该地近二千农民即自动分了蒋匪地主的粮食。不少农民均自动要求参加我军。解放军在帮助群众分粮中，坚决贯彻了团结中农（如不吃中农以下的粮食等）与保护工商业的政策。另讯：热东分区战地工作团，随军深入蒋占区发动群众，去年十一月中旬，在锦承铁路与大小凌河间发动了达子营等三十余村，农民分粮达百万余斤及其他浮财甚多。平均每人分得粮食三百斤，衣服被褥二件，农具两件，牲口一头。并在分粮分浮财中开始建立起贫雇小组。"

Within four days, 66 Chiang bandits from Faku brought weapons and defected to our army. Many junior officers of Chiang's bandits also fled to the liberated areas. Last month, nine Chiang bandit lieutenants in Siping successively defected to our garrison in Bamiancheng. Among those who came to defect to our army from Changchun, three Chiang bandit air force mechanics, Ma Jie and others, were also found. In addition, there have also been small-scale mutinies in Fu bandits' units in Chahar Province, because they are unwilling to be cannon fodder for the Fu bandits. In the past month alone, more than 40 people including Wu Bishan of the 2nd Cavalry Column, more than 40 people including Guo Si of the 9th Regiment of the 5th Cavalry Brigade, more than 30 people including Yu Zhanhai of the puppet Chahar Provincial Cavalry First Column, and more than 20 people including Song Si of the puppet Huade County Police Team have successively mutinied.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北蒋匪怕我打击　整班哗变投诚\n\n1948-01-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北蒋匪怕我打击\n  　整班哗变投诚\n    【新华社东北二十七日电】在解放军冬季攻势胜利声威的震慑下，蒋匪士气日益沮丧，士兵已由零散投诚我军，发展到小股哗变。上月上旬，吉林近郊六十军人力输送团一营二连一排第三班全班哗变，杀死该排排副苏春明，拖出九二机枪一挺、步枪四支。该军暂二十一师工兵营一连二排第八班哗变时，杀死该班班长钱振业，拖出加拿大机枪一挺、步枪二支，投奔我军。上月二十四日，新民四十九军暂五十五师二团二营乘火车调往打虎屯，开到柳条沟铁桥附近，发现铁桥被毁，当列车停驶时，全营三百六十人逃跑了一半以上。法库蒋匪四天内有六十六人带枪投诚我军。蒋匪下级军官也多逃来解放区，上月份内四平蒋匪尉级军官九名，先后向我八面城驻军投诚，从长春前来投诚我军的人员中，并发现有蒋匪空军机械士马杰等三人。另察北傅匪所部也有因不愿替傅贼当炮灰而发生小股哗变，仅上月份内，即有骑二纵队吴毕山等四十多人、骑五旅九团郭四等四十多人、伪察省骑保一纵队于占海等三十多人、伪化德县保警队宋四等二十多人先后哗变。"

The 8th Company of this unit first launched this movement in early August of last year, and it has already achieved results. This time, in the process of establishing the Party Committee, it was extended to every company. At the celebration meeting jointly held by Party members and the masses to celebrate the establishment of the Party Committee, the spirit of democracy was fully promoted. Many problems between the Party and the masses were examined and resolved, greatly improving the relationship between the Party and the masses. The Party's prestige among the masses has been raised to an unprecedented level. Many non-Party soldiers have a new understanding of the Party, feel that being a Communist Party member is the most glorious thing, and express their determination to be able to join the Party. One liberated soldier said at the meeting: \"In the Kuomintang, even a second-class private cannot raise an opinion about a first-class private. Here, opinions can be expressed to Communist Party members and cadres. It's really unbelievable.\" Old soldier Zhang Shichun also said: \"In the past, my thinking was backward, and I thought it didn't matter whether or not you were in the Party, but now I understand the Party.\" At the meeting, the masses criticized certain Party members and cadres with a sincere attitude, and the Party members and cadres also humbly accepted the opinions of the masses and conducted self-criticism. Squad Leader Han Zhenjiang (a Party member) said in his self-criticism: \"I have violated mass discipline and my leadership over everyone has not been good. I am very sorry to everyone. This criticism is very helpful to me.\" He asked everyone to help him more in the future. The masses showed an extremely cautious attitude when recommending Party member candidates. For example, in the 8th Company, four candidates for Party membership were recommended by the masses at the meeting. During the evaluation, three were approved by the masses. When discussing Sui Lin, soldier Yang Yiming said: \"Sui Lin is brave in battle, but he has a bad temper and doesn't care enough about the masses. My opinion is to talk about it after he corrects these shortcomings.\" Based on the opinions of the masses, the branch committee accepted three people for Party membership and decided to continue to cultivate and educate Sui Lin. Sui Lin also said: \"These shortcomings should be corrected. I will join the Party after they are corrected.\" In total, more than 30 new Party members were accepted in this unit through mass evaluation. A wave of enthusiasm for joining the Party has been set off in the army, and people have successively made plans to join the Party and plans to earn merit to join the Party.

Before his departure, Bei Zuyi had specially collected data on the economic, financial, transportation, agricultural, forestry, and resource aspects of the Chiang-controlled areas, which he took with him to the United States. In the first meeting between Bei and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Thorp and others on the 19th, the Director of the Investment Development Division of the U.S. Department of State, Haverly, participated. On the day of Bei's arrival in the United States, Hunter, a former U.S. diplomat in China and now a well-known U.S. exporter to China, spoke on behalf of major American monopolists, calling for American capital to be invested in railways, factories, agriculture, and forestry in South China. A few days before Bei's arrival, on January 9th, Kong Xiangxi, one of the four major financial magnates of Chiang Kai-shek's clique, openly told American capitalists at the \"Far East Industrial and Commercial Association Committee\" (formerly the \"Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Association\") in the United States that as long as the United States gave Chiang Kai-shek's clique \"appropriate assistance,\" the Chiang government would encourage and protect foreign (American) capital, \"allowing it to participate in the general development of China's latent natural resources.\" He Yingqin, another reactionary ringleader of Chiang Kai-shek's clique remaining in the United States, also shamelessly proposed in a speech in Ligonier to exchange China's natural resources and manpower, as well as China's important strategic bases, for American dollars.

A democratic county government has been established, and the people in the villages have also risen up to take charge, seizing over 700 guns from the landlords and forming local armed forces.

On the 2nd of this month, the local corps and local armed forces ambushed Zhang Diankui's bandit gang of over 500 people in Xiaoshijie, northwest of Luoning, killing and wounding more than 20. On the 3rd, another 500+ bandits attacked again, but were killed by us for 50+. On the 4th, in the Wangyuegou area of Yiyang, we captured two men, including a squad leader of Feng Kegong's bandit gang, seizing two rifles and pistols. On the 5th, we took advantage of the victory to conduct a three-pronged suppression of bandits in the Xiaogou, Miaoxia, and Magou areas of Yiyang, largely destroying the bandit secret service organization Miaodaohui, killing more than 150 and wounding more than 30. We also killed 188 bandits and wounded 6 in Gucun, Sanxiang, and captured more than 30 alive. On the 8th, the Xin'an militia completely eliminated the bandits in Wangtou Village, capturing more than 30 alive. On the 11th, we advanced to suppress bandits in Xiaoshijie, scattering Wang Diankui's hundred-plus men, killing and wounding more than 20, and capturing four alive.

Therefore, the local bandits and Chiang troops often come to compete for it, but they have been repelled by the KuangKou villagers' militia. On the 15th of this month, they repelled the 27th attack by the local bandits and Chiang troops. That morning, the local bandits and Chiang troops from Xin'an and Mengjin attacked Wangzhuang in three routes. One route of more than 100 people, with a machine gun, attacked from the Genfengzui stockade on the left side of Wangzhuang; another route of more than 80 people, with two machine guns, occupied the Zushimiao high ground 20 miles southeast of Wangzhuang, using firepower to cover another route of more than 200 people attacking from the front. At this time, the KuangKou militia captain Guo Yi and others resisted, fighting fiercely. Although a militiaman, Chen Dahong, sacrificed himself, everyone did not waver at all. After fighting for more than an hour, they finally defeated the bandits, killing four and wounding 14, including their company commander, and seizing two rifles.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳五分区歼土蒋八百　王庄民兵打垮敌二十七次进攻\n\n1948-01-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太岳五分区歼土蒋八百\n  　王庄民兵打垮敌二十七次进攻\n    【太岳消息】五分区地方部队，接连歼灭蒋记土匪八百余人。本月二日，地方兵团和地方武装在洛宁西北小石街，打了土匪张殿魁部五百多人的埋伏，打死打伤二十多人。三日，又有土匪五百多人来犯，又被我打死他五十多人。四日，在宜阳王岳沟一带，活捉土匪冯克功部小队长以下二人，得长短枪两支。五日乘胜三路清剿宜阳小沟、庙下、马沟一带的土匪，把土匪特务组织庙道会大部消灭，打死了一百五十多人，打伤三十多人。又在三乡古村打死土匪一百八十八人，打伤六人，活捉卅多人。八日，新安民兵把望头村土匪全部消灭，活捉三十多人。十一日进剿小石街土匪，把王殿魁的一百多人打散了，打死打伤二十多人，活捉四人。十二日又在史村、王村清剿，打死打伤土匪二十多人，一度收复渑池城，守城土匪吓跑了。十五日再向炎村进剿，打死土匪十五人，活捉六十多人，得步枪三支。十六日再在三乡清剿，打死土匪头子陈玉奇以下五十多人，活捉五十多人，得步枪五支。十九日，又围攻水池、上下营的高尚信、叶老五、叶老六土匪部，活捉土匪地主恶霸一百多人，得步枪十一支，手枪两支，马一匹。\n    【太岳消息】豫西新安东北，有个山岭，叫王庄。是控制黄河上西沃渡口的重要地方，所以土蒋经常来争夺，可是都被狂口等村民兵打退了。本月十五日，第二十七次打退了土蒋的进攻。这天上午，新安、孟津的土蒋分三路向王庄进攻，有一路百多人，带了一挺机枪，从王庄左边的根凤嘴寨打过来；一路八十多人，带了两挺机枪，占住王庄东南二十里的高地祖师庙，用火力掩护另一路二百多人从正面进攻。这时，狂口民兵大队长郭义等，就抵抗起来，打得很激烈。虽然有个民兵陈大宏牺牲了，可是大家一点不动摇，打了一个多钟头，终于把土匪打垮了，打死他四人，打伤他中队长以下十四人，得步枪两支。"

He was the first Chiang Kai-shek army commander captured since the Northeast People's Liberation Army's major counter-offensive. When the People's Liberation Army shelled Wenjiatai, he was squatting in the 43rd Division headquarters bunker supervising the battle. Later, the People's Liberation Army's artillery fire became increasingly intense, and not only did the soldiers collapse and scatter, but even the division commander and regimental commander who were supervising the battle with him fled in all directions. He himself desperately led seven guards out of the bunker in an attempt to escape. But before he could run a hundred meters, he was captured by the People's Liberation Army.\n\nAfter being captured, he pretended to be a secretary in the military headquarters and even changed his name. He wore an oil-stained coat, broken shoes, and smeared a layer of black ash on his face, hiding in a dark corner, not saying a word all day long. But his subordinate officers finally revealed his secret. At first, he didn't admit it, but when he saw the human and material evidence, he had to stammer, \"There's no need for me to hide it anymore. I know your policies, and I know you won't kill me.\" Regarding the annihilation of the New 5th Army, he believes this was a heavy blow to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Northeast China. Because the New 5th Army was the \"important mobile force\" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Northeast China. Its subordinate 195th Division used to be the main force of the 52nd Army, and the 43rd Division was the main force of the 94th Army. Although in terms of equipment and training it was not as good as the New 1st Army and New 6th Army, in terms of marching ability and combat effectiveness, it surpassed them. He believes that the reason for the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' failure in the Gongzhuling campaign, in addition to the mistakes in command by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' Northeast Headquarters and himself, was mainly because the People's Liberation Army's tactics were unpredictable, and especially the bravery and tenacity of the commanders and fighters were unmatched by them. He said, \"I have been through hundreds of battles and have never seen such a capable army.\" Therefore, he believes that the future of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Northeast China is very pessimistic. Chen Linda is from Xiangtan, Hunan, is 45 years old this year, and graduated from the fourth class of the Whampoa Military Academy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋匪新五军军长　陈林达被俘记\n常工\n1948-01-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋匪新五军军长\n  　陈林达被俘记\n    【新华社东北二十六日电】分社记者常工报导蒋匪新五军军长陈林达被俘情形：陈林达是被俘后的第七天查出来的，他是东北解放军大反攻以来俘获的第一名蒋匪军长。当解放军炮击文家台时，他正蹲在四十三师师部掩蔽部督战。后来解放军炮火愈来愈猛，不仅士兵纷纷溃散，连和他一起督战的师长、团长也都四散逃生。他自己狼狈的带了七个卫士从掩蔽部跑出来，企图逃走。但没有跑出一百米达远，就被解放军俘获了。\n    他被俘以后假装是军部的书记官，并且还换了个名字。身上穿着一件油污的大衣，脚上踏着一双破鞋，又在脸上涂上一层黑灰，整天躲在阴暗的屋角里不吭气。那知他的下级军官终于揭穿了他的秘密。开始他还不承认，后来看到人证物证，只好嗫嚅地说：“我用不着再隐瞒了，你们的政策我是知道的，你们不杀我也是知道的。”对于这次新五军的覆没，他认为这是给东北蒋匪一个沉重的打击。因为新五军是东北蒋匪的“重要机动部队”，其所辖一九五师过去是五十二军的主力，四十三师是九十四军的主力，虽然在装备和训练上不如新一军、新六军，但在行军力和战斗力上则超过它们。他认为蒋匪在公主屯战役的失败原因，除了蒋匪东北行辕和他的指挥错误外，主要还是解放军战术变化莫测，尤其是指战员的勇猛顽强是他们无法比拟的。他说：“我经过数百次战斗，没有看见过这样能打的部队”，因此他认为东北蒋匪的前途非常悲观。陈林达是湖南湘潭人，现年四十五岁，黄埔四期毕业。"

In Guangzhou, the ruling center of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in South China, all transactions are valued in Hong Kong dollars. A reporter from a Nanjing news agency bought several pieces of clothing in Guangzhou. After the purchase, because he did not have enough money on him, he returned to the hotel to get the money. The round trip took only ten minutes, but because the Hong Kong dollar had risen, he had to add more money to take delivery. In general trading places, telephone inquiries are constantly made about the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate in order to adjust transaction prices. In Jiujiang, a port on the Yangtze River, all major transactions are calculated in silver dollars. At the beginning of last month, each silver dollar was exchanged for more than 100,000 Chiang currency, and it is still rising. In the rural areas of southern Jiangsu, barter has replaced Chiang currency. The most common is the use of rice, and in yarn-producing areas, yarn is used. All borrowing, business, and payments are calculated in yarn or rice. Chiang currency is only used for small payments or when both parties agree. In one county town, even buying furniture is based on the price of yarn. For example, a wooden cabinet costs ten bundles of yarn, and a bed costs fifteen bundles of yarn. Buying a conscript (i.e., the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' so-called \"volunteer soldier\") costs about one piece (forty bundles) of yarn or more. Larger gambling and usury are also calculated in yarn, with a monthly interest rate of three bundles per piece of yarn lent. A Shanghai economic magazine pointed out that in the final stage of inflation, this rural barrier against the intrusion of Chiang currency will inevitably become more widely popular throughout the Chiang-controlled areas.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋区人民不要蒋币　城市用金银乡村用米线算帐\n\n1948-01-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋区人民不要蒋币\n  　城市用金银乡村用米线算帐\n    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据各方报导：蒋匪的恶性通货膨胀与其军事危机的加深，已使蒋币丧失信用，蒋区人民已逐渐普遍拒用蒋币。蒋匪心脏区域上海，买机器、顶房子等等，都用金条交易，大额借款用美钞黄金计算，甚至收房租亦拒用蒋币而以美钞论值。蒋匪华南统治中心广州，一切交易均以香港钞票计值。南京某通讯社记者在广州购衣料数件、购定后因身上款项不足，返旅店取款，来回不过十分钟，因港钞已涨，即需另行加价，否则即不能取货。一般交易场所，均不断以电话探询港钞汇率，以调整交易价格。长江口岸九江，一切较大交易均以银洋计算。上月初旬，每元银洋已兑蒋币十万余元，现仍在上涨中。江南农村实物通货已代替蒋币。最普通的是用稻米，产纱区则用纱。一切借贷、经营、支付都以纱或米计算，只在零星支付或双方同意时才用蒋币。有一个县城，连买家具都以纱为折价。例如一个木橱十捆纱，一张床十五捆纱。买壮丁（即蒋匪所谓“志愿兵”）一个，大约要一件（四十捆）多纱。较大赌博、放利亦用纱计算，放纱一件月利三捆。沪某经济杂志指出：在通货膨胀末期，这种农村阻遏蒋币侵入的壁垒，必将更为广泛的普及蒋区各地。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 26th. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has produced an army-loving model, Zhu Zhengke, who has become a typical example for consolidating unit unity, learning, training, and combat. The characteristics of Zhu Zhengke's leadership and education methods are caring and considerate, actively helping, patiently educating, and focusing on praise. He is from Juxian County, Shandong Province, and of poor peasant origin. He has always been active in his work. In May of last year, he was transferred to the 8th squad of a certain company as squad leader. At that time, the squad was not united internally, and unhealthy tendencies prevailed. Zhu conducted investigations and research and learned that the main reason was that the deputy squad leader put on bureaucratic airs, which made the general soldiers dissatisfied, especially the veteran soldier Xu Hongfu, who had a fierce conflict with the deputy squad leader. Therefore, he took the lead in everything and did everything himself. When he discovered good things in the soldiers, he praised them in a timely manner. Soon, the soldiers reflected, \"This squad leader is not bad.\" Later, everyone approached him. Zhu's care for Xu Hongfu was even more meticulous. He became warm with Xu in life. He said to Xu, \"Whether the 8th squad can be successful depends on you. You are a veteran soldier. You look down on the deputy squad leader, and others will look down on him even more.\" Xu said very moved: \"I must change and ensure that I get along well with the deputy squad leader.\" Then Zhu went to persuade the deputy squad leader. The deputy squad leader ran to serve food and water to the soldiers that day. The soldiers also pulled the deputy squad leader onto the kang. In this way, it developed, and the relationship between the eighth squad began to improve. The soldier Qian Bowen was the most mischievous and troublesome. Once, after marching only seven li, Qian lay down on the side of the road and refused to move. Zhu kindly ran to help him carry his gun, but Qian glared at him and said, \"Get out of here, can't you carry seven and a half catties when you're a soldier?\" When Qian was on guard duty, Zhu planned to talk to him, but Qian said, \"Zhu Zhengke, stay away, I want to desert, you can't tie me down.\" Zhu was not angry at all, and still patiently helped and educated him, and praised Qian's slight advantages, finally making Qian change out of gratitude and become a combat hero and model squad leader. The entire eighth squad became a model squad because of his improvements. After the summer offensive last year, Zhu was promoted to platoon leader, and again used this working method to create an all-around model platoon. He was also invited by other battalions to give reports on his work experience. The squad leaders were very impressed and learned from him one after another. Now, the \"Zhu Zhengke style\" of leadership has become famous throughout the division, and the division and regiment have called for launching a Zhu Zhengke movement to improve company work and consolidate the troops.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 解放军某部号召　学习爱兵模范朱正科\n\n1948-01-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　解放军某部号召\n  　学习爱兵模范朱正科\n    【新华社东北二十六日电】解放军某部出现爱兵模范朱正科，成为巩固部队团结、学习、练兵、战斗的一个典型。朱正科的领导和教育方法的特点是爱护体贴，积极帮助，耐心教育，表扬为主。他是山东莒县人，雇农出身，一贯工作积极，去年五月间调某连八班当班长，当时该班内部不团结，邪气占上风，朱进行了调查研究，了解其主要原因是班附摆官僚架子，使一般战士不满意，尤其是老战士徐鸿福和班附闹得很凶，于是他自己就事事带头，亲自动手，发现战士中有好的地方，及时予以表扬。不久，战士们反映说：“这个班长还不错”，后来大家才接近他。朱对于徐鸿福的爱护，更是无微不至，生活上和徐搞热了，他对徐说：“八班能否搞好就靠你，你是老战士，你看不起班附，别人更看不起他”。徐很感动的说：“我一定要转变，保证和班附搞好”。然后朱又去说服班附，班附当天就跑去首先端饭打水给战士们，战士们也拉着班附上炕，这样，发展开了，就开始把八班的关系改善了。该班战士钱伯文最调皮捣蛋，有一次行军才走了七里，钱就歪在路旁不走，朱好意跑去帮他背枪，钱反瞪着眼说：“去你的，当得了兵背不起七斤半？”钱站岗时，朱打算和他谈谈，钱却说：“朱正科，靠远点，我要开小差，你拴也拴不住”。朱一点也不冒火，仍然耐心帮助、教育，并表扬钱的些微好处，终于使钱因感动而转变成为战斗英雄，和模范班长。整个八班由于他的改进成了模范班。去年夏季攻势后，朱被提升为排长，又以此种工作方法创造了全面模范排。他并被其他各营请去作工作经验报告，班长们都很佩服，纷纷向他学习。现“朱正科式”的领导作风已闻名全师，师团并号召展开朱正科运动，以改进连队工作，巩固部队。"

The Chiang Kai-shek bandit government has also dispatched comprador magnate Bei Zuyi to the United States to discuss with the US government the \"most effective form of assistance.\" It is said that Bei carries with him a \"plan related to currency reform.\" A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented: As early as last year, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government, through Huang Yuanbin (member of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's National Economic Commission), continuously promoted its so-called \"currency reform plan.\" Huang dreamed that as long as his \"currency reform plan\" was followed, it would stabilize foreign exchange and stabilize prices. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek bandit government officials, including Chiang Kai-shek and Sun Ke, have also been promoting it in the same way. This illustrates: First, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government's economic crisis has reached an incurable point, and the Chiang currency is indeed very difficult to maintain. Second, the series of \"emergency measures\" taken by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government in the past year have completely failed.\n    The Chiang Kai-shek bandit government's \"currency reform\" is by no means for the sake of \"stabilizing prices,\" but a new conspiracy to plunder the people in the Chiang-controlled areas on an even larger scale. The realization of this conspiracy will render the value of the Chiang currency currently held by the people in the Chiang-controlled areas worthless, thereby concentrating the little living resources in the hands of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas even more into the hands of the four major families, in order to engage in civil war and delay their final collapse. On the other hand, the so-called \"currency reform plan\" also contains a new conspiracy to sell out the country. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit government raised this issue in order to request loans from the United States, while what the US imperialists want is Chinese sovereignty. The mission of comprador magnate Bei Zuyi's trip to the United States is to negotiate the terms of selling out the country. According to a United Press report on January 14th: \"The US State Department is proceeding through semi-official channels,\" but mainly through informal channels—through \"secret\" conditions proposed by senior officials in Nanjing and Washington. The US State Department will agree to \"request appropriations from Congress\" on this basis. This news exposes that new treasonous negotiations are secretly underway between Chiang and the US, which requires the people of the whole country to rise up to oppose it, and must call on the American people to join the Chinese people in stopping the US government's reactionary behavior of aiding Chiang in the civil war and undermining the peaceful friendship between the Chinese and American people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 记者评蒋匪“货币改革计划”　蒋匪经济危机没法治又耍新花头害民卖国\n\n1948-01-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　新华社记者评蒋匪“货币改革计划”\n  　蒋匪经济危机没法治又耍新花头害民卖国\n    【新华社陕北二十七日电】正当蒋管区物价飞涨，各地市场日益呈现着混乱与不安的时候，所谓“货币改革”的问题广泛的流传于京沪各地，蒋匪政府并派遣了大买办贝祖诒前去美国与美政府讨论“最有效的援助形式”，据说贝氏携有“有关货币改革的计划”。新华社记者评称：早在去年蒋匪政府即通过黄元彬（蒋匪全国经济委员会委员），不断的宣传其所谓“货币改革计划”。黄象做梦似的说，只要按照他的“货币改革计划，便将使得外汇稳定，物价稳定。最近蒋匪政府大小官员，包括蒋介石、孙科在内，也都照样宣传起来。这说明了：第一、蒋匪政府的经济危机已到了无可救药的地步，蒋币已实在很难继续维持下去；第二、过去一年中蒋匪政府一连串的“紧急措施”完全破产。\n    蒋匪政府要办“货币改革”，决非为着“稳定物价”，而是更大规模掠夺蒋区人民的新阴谋。这个阴谋的实现，就将使得蒋管区人民现所持有蒋币的价值化为乌有，从而蒋管区人民手中一点少得可怜的生活资料更加集中于四大家族之手，俾从事内战以延缓其最后崩溃的命运。另一方面，所谓“货币改革计划”，又包含着一个新的卖国阴谋，蒋匪政府提出这个题目，为的是向美国要求贷款，而美帝国主义者所要的却是中国主权。大买办贝祖诒赴美的任务就是去谈判卖国条件。据合众社一月十四日电：“美国务院正经由半官方路线”，但主要的还经由非正式的方面——经由南京及华盛顿的高级人士“秘密”的提出条件，美国务院将在这个基础上同意“向国会要求拨款”。这个消息暴露出新的卖国谈判已在蒋美之间秘密进行，需要全国人民起来反对，并须号召美国人民与中国人民一道制止美国政府这种援蒋内战、破坏中美人民和平友谊的反动行为。"

    "content": "Farmers' Voice\n\n　　Please Everyone Judge Fairly\n　　To the responsible comrade of the People's Daily:\n　　Please publish my major grievance! I will talk about the exploitation I suffered at the hands of the evil landlord and the judicial section chief within the democratic government who shielded the landlord:\n\n　　I. The landlord's exploitation of me:\n　　In about 1930, Wang Yan (deceased) and Wang Xibai of this village asked my father to be their guarantor, borrowing 200 silver dollars from Feng Shuren (the landlord) at 3% monthly interest. After several years of interest payments, my father and Wang Yan had a falling out due to some issues and stopped communicating. Later, the creditor, Feng Shuren, urgently demanded repayment. At this point, the principal and interest totaled 220 dollars. Wang Yan and Wang Xibai privately entrusted Wang Ruming of the same village to mediate, giving Feng a plot of seven mu of land to repay the debt. This was not done through the guarantor. At the time, Feng said the land was worth 20 dollars per mu, while Wang Yan and Wang Xibai said it should be calculated at 30 dollars per mu. Feng said there was still a shortfall of 80 dollars and forced my father to cover it. My family was unable to pay, so he pressured my father to hand over four mu of our land as security. Feng said at the time, \"If that seven mu sells for enough to cover the 220 dollars, I won't make your father pay.\" Later, Feng also calculated Wang Yan and Wang Xibai's land back to the owners, at 40 dollars per mu, totaling 280 dollars for the seven mu, which was handed over to Feng Shuren through Wang Ruming. However, Feng turned around and demanded the four mu of land that my father had guaranteed. My father refused. In the spring, my sorghum had grown over a foot tall, and Feng sent people to plow it over with a ridging plow. The villagers intervened, preventing them from plowing it all. When the sorghum ripened, Feng led a group of people with guns, both long and short, to harvest my family's sorghum. We firmly refused. Feng cursed us and said, \"If I can't take you down, I'll change my surname!\" They immediately hitched up a mule-drawn carriage and forced my father to go to Guan County to file a lawsuit. My father had no choice but to go with them to Guan County. I was only fourteen years old then; I'm thirty-two now. At that time, Feng had the final say in the old government; he had money and influence. The government immediately issued a summons and used administrative pressure to force my father to admit wrongdoing. The officials all told my father to endure it, saying that he couldn't win against Feng, even with ten people like him. My father had no choice but to swallow his anger. After mediation, he was told to compensate Feng 100 silver dollars and pay for two tables of guests, costing another 20 silver dollars. They wouldn't let us leave the city gate that day until we paid in cash. We were poor people; how could we have so much cash? We had to ask Wang Yushan and Wang Guangxin of the same village to be our guarantors, borrowing 100 silver dollars from Du Tingju of Du Zhaozhuang in the Third District of the county at 3% monthly interest, which was immediately given to Feng to settle the matter. After using Du Tingju's 100 dollars and paying interest for several years, we sold eighteen mu of our own land to repay this unjust debt. After the Eighth Route Army arrived in 1938, various salvation organizations were formed. At that time, I was making oil for a living and joined the Youth Salvation Association, serving as the director of the village Youth Salvation Association, often going to the district government committee meetings. The superiors repeatedly said that anyone with grievances should bring them up. At this time, I approached Feng Shuren once and said, \"Mr. Feng! Today we're going to settle old scores.\" Because I was Feng's nephew, Feng Shuren said, \"Nephew, why would we settle accounts? If you have nothing to eat or drink, I have plenty. Just say the word, and I'll send someone to farm and deliver it to you.\" I said, \"Don't just talk nicely. We must see this through.\" Feng immediately hired some \"busy bodies,\" who, carrying box cannons and riding horses, went to my house and threatened us. Under those circumstances, I didn't dare to say anything definitive. I said, \"Since you're all here, I've told you my grievances. You can decide what to do!\" After Wang Qinghe and seven or eight others of the same village mediated, they gave me 50 yuan in legal tender, and that was the end of it. But I always felt that the injustice in my heart hadn't been vented. At this time, in December 1939, I joined the revolutionary work. During the mass movement in 1945, I again sued Feng Shuren, going to all levels of government, but the case was never resolved fairly after two years. Therefore, I am reporting the facts to your newspaper, hoping that you will help to clarify the truth and redress the people's grievances.\n\n　　II. The handling of the case by various levels of government:\n\n　　I initially sued at the Xin County X District Office, where Fan Shangchen was the judicial assistant. The first time I went to the district office, I presented my written complaint and explained it in person. I asked him to summon the defendant, but he said he was too busy and told me to come back in a few days. The second time I went, bringing witnesses, I asked Assistant Fan to summon the defendant for cross-examination, but he still didn't summon the defendant. Fan Shangchen said, \"Feng Shuren is a landlord; it's so hot, he won't come even if I summon him. I'll talk to the village cadres of his village first and ask about it. You can go back now.\" In the district office, he never confronted Feng Shuren directly. Seeing that the problem couldn't be solved, I appealed to the Xin County Democratic Government, where Niu Xiangfu (a landlord who was being struggled against) was the judicial section chief. He and Feng Shuren were old acquaintances. During the trial, he sided with the landlord Feng Shuren instead of the poor and hired peasants, eating and drinking at the landlord's house. During the court session, because I was working for the Guan County government, I didn't appear in court; my father went to Jiaozhuang for the hearing with the witnesses Wang Ruming and Wang Xibai. But Section Chief Niu had two different attitudes when questioning them: he had a forceful and oppressive attitude when questioning my father and the witnesses, but a welcoming and natural attitude with a smile when questioning the landlord Feng Shuren. He even secretly asked the witnesses, \"How much money did the plaintiff Wang Rujiang promise you?\" And he threatened the witnesses, \"You must tell the truth, or I will severely punish you.\" After the court session, the witnesses went home and cried bitterly, saying, \"They still talk about democracy now, but is this how it is? The words of the poor are still like farts!\" When they returned, my father was so angry that he fell ill for several days, coughing and barely alive (he was in his sixties or seventies). After a long time, a judgment was finally issued, stating: \"The debt covering is not proved, not convenient to investigate.\" We had both witnesses and material evidence. At that time, I asked the government to detain Feng Shuren, saying that if it was found that I was falsely accusing him, I would take the blame. But the government didn't listen, and Feng Shuren and his son have now defected to the enemy (in Jinan). I felt very distressed, so I appealed to the Special Commissioner's Office, but when the case was tried, the judicial staff member Li Yanling sided with the landlord Feng Shuren and not with the poor and hired peasants. Fortunately, the judicial section chief, Comrade Song Shaoliang, had a firm proletarian stance. Later, he issued a judgment to me, which stated: \"Wang Rujiang's debt has been proven true from all sides, and the county judgment is overturned, and Feng Shuren should compensate Wang Rujiang 3,000 yuan.\" I felt that the current trial of cases should side with the poor and hired peasants. In the past, the dark governments all sided with the landlords; now it should be changed to side with the poor, and the landlords should be made to run a little. At this time, the judgment proved the facts, and no matter how much the judgment was for, politically, it was considered a victory, so let it go! But according to rumors, the village cadres said to Feng Shuren, \"Appeal to the Administrative Office!\" and said, \"Our village's wealth cannot be taken by outsiders.\" Because I am from Xizhou Village, Third District, Guan County, which is not the same county or village, Feng Shuren appealed to the Administrative Office. But when the Administrative Office summoned the case, the landlord Feng and the village cadres of his village arrived, but I did not. My father was too old and unable to travel easily, so he did not appear in court either. Because I was at my work post, at that time, my understanding was that I couldn't abandon my entire job to handle my own affairs, so I wrote a letter to the Judicial Office of the Administrative Office. I felt that our Administrative Office couldn't handle it sloppily. Who would have thought that the Administrative Office would have made a sloppy judgment? When I received the judgment and read it, my heart was inflamed. The judgment stated that \"the Special Commissioner's Office judgment has no basis and should be overturned, and that the covering debt is not true. Even if it were true, it was in 1938, it has been resolved once, and should not be pursued again.\" I immediately went to the Administrative Office again (still on work business), but a certain Cao of the Judicial Office scolded me. Cao said, \"Why didn't you come on time when the case was summoned?\" I said that because I was busy with work, if I didn't come, shouldn't you investigate clearly before handling it? He said, \"This is how I handle it. Do as you please. There's also Director Meng and the Border Region Government. You can find whoever you want; do as you see fit!\" I wanted to go to the Border Region Government, but because my work couldn't be left, and my father was too old to take the witnesses, and there were no travel expenses, I had no choice but to swallow my anger and endure it!

    "content": "Over the Past Year\n  　The Development of Armed Popular Uprisings in the Chiang-Controlled Areas\n    The people's power is as great as a mountain, and the revolting rakes are countless; rotten fish must rot from the inside out, black-hearted bosses, get out!\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Jiangnan Folk Song\n    Over the past year, armed popular uprisings in the Chiang-controlled areas have developed rapidly. According to available statistics, the people's army is active in sixteen provinces and more than four hundred and eighty counties (excluding Hainan Island, Taiwan, and Xinjiang), with a total strength of approximately one million people. In Guangdong, the people's armed forces have grown from 20,000 to over 70,000 in the past year, and the area of activity has expanded from over 30 counties to over 60 counties (out of a total of 98 counties in the province). In Yunnan, the people's armed forces had grown to over 44,000 by the end of last year, more than double the number from a year earlier (less than 20,000 at the end of 1946), occupying the vast countryside of 35 counties. In Guangxi, the people's armed forces had expanded to 39 counties by the end of last year. In Hunan and Hubei, the people's armed forces numbered 25,000, active in over 40 counties. In Xikang, the people's armed forces numbered nearly 200,000. In Sichuan, people's armies are active in almost all of the province's 140-plus counties and cities, comprising over a hundred units, large and small, with a total strength of 200,000. Even in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the two provinces under the longest control of the Chiang bandits, the vast rural areas of northern Jiangsu are entirely controlled by the People's Liberation Army. In the southern 28 counties, people's armed forces are known to be active in 23 counties. In Zhejiang, people's armies are active in 53 out of the province's 71 counties. In other provinces such as Fujian, Guizhou, Anhui, and Jiangxi, the people's armed forces are also continuing to develop.\n\n    Looking at the trend of the development of the people's armed forces in the Chiang-controlled areas over the past year, the following characteristics are evident:\n\n    (1) In order to consolidate their own strength and crush the Chiang bandits' \"encirclement,\" \"suppression,\" and \"joint suppression\" campaigns, the people's armed forces are gradually moving from dispersed activities to unified leadership, from moving around to establishing base areas, from isolated resistance to coordinated operations, and seizing enemy weapons to equip themselves, expanding into a powerful force. In southeastern Guangxi, the people's army led by Huang Shixian, which launched an uprising in March of last year, attacked Rongxian and captured Tengxian, has established the \"Democratic Allied Army Independent 10th Division,\" and joined forces with the Liu Zhenxia Column of the Southern Guangdong People's Army, using the Gou Lou Mountain area as a base, with great momentum. The people's armed forces in the counties of Quanxian, Xing'an, and Gongcheng, adjacent to Hunan Province, have established the \"Eastern Guangxi Liberated Area,\" using the Du Pang, Meng Zhu, and Lin He mountain ranges as bases, and have organized mass organizations such as trade unions, peasant associations, and women's associations. The people's army on the (Vietnam)-Guangdong border, using the Shiwan Dashan Mountains as a base, formed two columns and three divisions, with a strength of over 30,000, and once captured Dongxing, opening granaries to relieve the poor. The \"Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan Border Region Command,\" based in the Dayu Mountains in northern Guangdong, leads a \"People's Liberation Army North Route Column\" of one division, extensively carrying out activities to harass the Chiang bandits. The cities of Nanxiong and Shixing have been isolated from the outside world and become isolated islands. The people's army in northern Sichuan, originating in Wangcang, once defeated four-pronged attacks by two regular Chiang bandit brigades and local militias, annihilated an entire detective battalion, expanded to tens of thousands of people, possessed machine guns, heavy artillery, and mortars, and operated in a vast area of more than ten counties. The people's army on the Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou border, comprising over ten units, large and small, was jointly organized into the \"Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou General Command\" by seventeen people's army leaders, growing from over three thousand to over ten thousand people. A unit of the people's army on the Guizhou, Hunan, and Hubei border, using the Bamian Mountain as a base, crushed multiple attacks by the Chiang bandits. The unit has now established a political department and formulated operational guidelines such as dispersing and regrouping. The people's armed forces led by Xu Shihao in southern Yunnan have grown from a small team of several hundred people in 1946 to five or six thousand people, forming the Democratic Allied Army First Column, leading peasants to oppose the Chiang bandits' conscription and grain requisition tyranny. After repeatedly defeating the Chiang army and achieving continuous victories, the troops under the command of Huang Guozhang, commander of the Central Fujian Military District, marched south and successfully joined forces with the Daiyun Column in Southern Fujian and the Wang-led people's army active in the Longxi and Anxi mountains, sometimes launching joint attacks and sometimes dispersing to carry out raids. The troops are strictly disciplined and deeply supported by the broad masses of the people.\n\n    (2) From simple military struggles, they have moved to destroy the Chiang bandits' reactionary ruling organs, establish patriotic and democratic regimes at all levels, and implement various democratic and beneficial policies. For example, the people's armed forces in the Siming Mountain area of eastern Zhejiang established the Zhejiang East Administrative Office and democratic county governments, carried out various democratic measures, and led the masses in resisting conscription and grain requisition. A unit of over a thousand people's army in Nanxiong County, northern Guangdong, destroyed over 30 Chiang bandit township offices, established six people's district governments, and launched a mass movement to divide grain and land. A reader's letter published in the Hong Kong \"Masses Weekly\" on September 11th last year stated: \"In the rural areas of counties bordering Guangdong and Jiangxi, many have gotten rid of the rule of the Chiang bandits' regime, are self-reliant, are implementing rent and interest reduction, are providing famine relief, and are living a stable and upward life.\" In southern Guangdong, all of Huaxian and Wuchuan, except for the county seat and six townships, and all of Lianjiang and Suixi, except for three townships, have established democratic regimes. The Guangdong-Guangxi people's army is preparing to organize a democratic district government, and the Xikang People's Self-Defense Army Headquarters had already proposed the organization of a \"People's Government\" last year.\n\n    (3) The political slogans and goals of the people's armed struggle have gradually become clearer and more elevated. From resisting conscription and grain requisition and punishing corrupt officials, they have advanced to opening granaries to relieve the poor and seizing land from local tyrants, launching a widespread peasant liberation movement. They have established a flesh-and-blood relationship with the broad masses of the people, and some have even explicitly put forward slogans such as opposing American imperialism's aggression against China and overthrowing the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. For example, the \"Democratic Alliance Revolutionary Army\" led by Huang More in southeastern Guangxi called for the realization of democracy, independence, and peace, and the overthrow of the fascist traitors! It launched activities in nearby counties, seizing grain and property from bullies and landlords wherever it went, which was deeply supported by the people. On the night of October 23rd last year, the people's armed forces in Changzhou, southern Jiangsu, attacked Qianjiashe and other villages in the seventh district and executed four heinous landlords, which greatly pleased the people. The people's armed forces in southern Fujian once led peasants in Anxi County to launch a movement against paying the \"Prime Minister's Rent,\" opposing the feudal exploitation of the Ji family for three hundred years. Under the influence of the people's army's victorious attacks, more than 20,000 peasants in Lijing Township, Lanxi, southern Anhui, automatically rose up to capture the bully landlord Huang Liding, and divided more than 300 dan of grain and a large number of clothes and farm tools.\n\n    With the victorious influence of the People's Liberation Army's large-scale counter-offensive in the future and the widespread dissemination of the Outline Land Law of China, it can be asserted that the anti-feudal struggle of the broad masses of peasants in the Chiang-controlled areas will further develop and deepen. It is precisely because the armed uprisings firmly defend the interests of the masses and vigorously help the peasants to liberate themselves that they have won the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people. For example, when the people's armed forces in southern Fujian held a cadre meeting, the peasants automatically took on the task of guarding and monitoring bad elements. When the masses discovered that the cadres attending the meeting were only eating two meals of thin porridge a day, they sent sweet potatoes, pickles, and beans, one basket at a time. In order to strengthen their own armed forces, many young peasants donated the money they earned from selling draftees to the people's army to buy weapons, and then escaped with their weapons to join the people's army in the shortest possible time.\n\n    (4) Encouraged by the victories of the People's Liberation Army in most parts of the country, and in order to effectively coordinate with the People's Liberation Army in combat, the people's armed forces in the Chiang-controlled areas have launched large-scale and proactive attacks, from attacking Chiang bandit district and township offices to capturing towns and destroying Chiang bandit land and water transportation lines. Towns such as Jixi, Jingxian, and Maolin in Anhui, Changhua and Quzhou (a key town on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway) in Zhejiang, Wuxuan, Guixian, Hengxian, Rongxian, Tengxian, Senlin, and Wangang in Guangxi, Ya'an, Tianquan, and Rongjing in Xikang, and Shenzhen (on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, where most of the American-aided Chiang bandit war weapons were transported), Xuwen, Dabu, Nanxiong, and Shixing in Guangdong have all been attacked, besieged, and captured by the people's army. The people's army in the suburbs of Shanghai even once attacked Panlong Town, forty miles west of Shanghai. The Guangzhou-Kowloon, Pinghan, Xiang-Gui, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Yunnan-Vietnam Railways, the internal war transportation lines of the Chiang bandits, and the Jing-Wu (Nanjing to Wuhu), Jing-Qi (Nanjing to Qimen, Anhui), Xi (Wuxi) Cheng (Jiangyin), and Qing (Pu) Hu (Shanghai) highways have also been constantly threatened and attacked by the people's army. In November of last year, the people's army in southern Jiangsu coordinated with the large-scale counter-offensive, continuously attacked the Xi-Cheng Highway, stormed into Xicangdian and other places, and launched widespread propaganda along the way, posting slogans such as \"People's Liberation Army's Large-Scale Counter-Offensive,\" shocking the enemy. The people's army in southern Anhui also launched a large-scale attack on the Jing-Wu and Wu-Tun highways, approaching the suburbs of Wuhu City, destroying the Wu-Tun highway, and dismantling the telegraph lines and bridges between Jixi and Ningkou, cutting off communication between the two cities. On November 18th, the people's armed forces destroyed the American-aided Chiang supply line, the Dakangkou iron bridge between Yingde and Qujiang on the Yuehan Railway, and cut off the Northern River water transport north of Yingde, all of which provided strong support to the People's Liberation Army marching south for the counter-offensive.\n\n    Faced with the widespread attacks by the people's armed forces, Chiang bandit officials of all sizes were only panicked and \"seeking help\" and \"reporting emergencies,\" with no way to resist.\n\n    (5) The people's armed uprisings in the Chiang-controlled areas, led by peasants and workers, and including a wide range of classes, is also a prominent feature. In addition to the broad masses of workers and peasants actively participating and becoming the backbone of the armed uprisings in order to resist the Chiang bandits' conscription, grain requisition, and other tyrannical policies, there are also intellectuals, civil servants, Chiang army officers and soldiers, and ethnic minorities in the border areas. For example, the people's armed forces in Guangdong and Guangxi have a large number of intellectuals participating. A unit of the Chen Gaohe division of the people's army active on both sides of the Lijiang River has a unit of \"Old Military Officer Corps\" members participating. Yi people in Xikang rose up in armed self-defense to resist the Chiang bandits' massacre policy. The Xinjiang people's anti-Chiang autonomy movement is still continuing. Under the power of the people's armed forces and political efforts to win them over, the Chiang bandit local security teams have continued to revolt and surrender. For example, in October of last year, Dai Wenheng and nine others from the Chiang bandit self-defense team in Lupuxiang, Dinghai, eastern Zhejiang, revolted and defected to the people's armed forces with over ten light machine guns, submachine guns, and other weapons. In August, the people's army in Wengyuan, northern Guangdong, launched a \"summoning surrender movement\" against the Chiang army, and in just one or two townships, more than a hundred Chiang \"self-defense teams\" and \"joint defense teams\" surrendered with their weapons. In the future, as the war situation develops, the Chiang bandit army will be annihilated in large numbers, and the Chiang bandit-controlled areas will gradually shrink. Its source of soldiers will inevitably become more scarce, and its financial resources will inevitably be more exhausted. In order to maintain its dying rule, the Chiang bandits will inevitably more frantically requisition grain, conscript soldiers, massacre, and suppress, which will inevitably arouse greater and more fierce resistance from the people. It can be foreseen that in the future, the armed anti-Chiang movement in the vast rural areas of the Chiang-controlled areas will develop, consolidate, and grow more universally and intensely, and will further combine with the patriotic and democratic movements of workers and students in the big cities. When the People's Liberation Army victoriously advances, crosses the Yangtze River southward, and captures cities and lands, it will become a powerful vanguard, guide, and internal response, directly coordinating with the war, and finally ending the reactionary rule of the \"black-hearted boss\" Chiang Kai-shek!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 过去一年间　蒋区民变武装的发展\n\n1948-01-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　过去一年间\n  　蒋区民变武装的发展\n    人民力量大如山，造反的钉耙千千万；鲜鱼要烂肚里烂，黑心头子你滚蛋！\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——江南民谣\n    过去一年间，蒋后民变武装飞跃发展。据现有材料统计：民军活动地区遍及十六省、四百八十余县（海南岛、台湾、新疆尚未计入），人数约百万。广东人民武装，去年一年由二万人发展为七万余人，活动地区由三十余县扩展至六十余县（全省共九十八县）；云南人民武装，截至去年底发展到四万四千人以上，较之一年前骤增一倍多（四六年底不足二万人），占领了三十五县的广大农村；广西人民武装，去年底已扩展至三十九县；湘、鄂人民武装数达二万五千，活动四十余县；西康人民武装近二十万人；四川全省百四十余县市，几乎都有民军活动，大小百余部，人数达二十万；即以蒋匪统治最久的江、浙两省言，江苏北部广大农村全部为解放军所控制，南部二十八县中，已知二十三县有人民武装活动；浙江全省七十一县中，有民军活动者达五十三县；他如闽、黔、皖、赣诸省人民武装，也都在继续发展中。\n    综观过去一年间蒋后人民武装发展之趋势，明显的具有以下特点：\n    （一）人民武装为团聚自己力量，粉碎蒋匪之“进剿”“围剿”“会剿”，逐渐由分散活动到统一领导，由四处流动到建立根据地，由孤立坚持到协同作战，并夺取敌人武器装备自己，扩展成为一支强大的劲旅，不少地区已造成乡村包围城市之形势。桂东南民军黄世宪部，去年三月起义，曾袭击容县、攻占藤县，已成立“民主联军独立第十师”，更与广东南路民军刘镇夏纵队会合，以勾漏山区为根据地，声势浩大；毗连湘境之全县、兴安、恭城等县的人民武装，则已成立“桂东解放区”，以都庞岭、萌渚岭、临贺岭为根据地，并组织工会、农会、妇女会等群众团体；越（南）粤边境民军，以十万大山为根据地，组成两个纵队三个师，人数达三万余，曾一举攻占东兴，开仓济贫；粤北以大庾岭为根据地之“赣、粤、湘边区司令部”率有“人民解放军北路纵队”一个师，广泛展开困扰蒋匪工作，南雄、始兴两县城已和外界隔绝而成孤岛；四川北部以旺苍为发祥地之民军，曾击溃蒋匪两个正规旅及地方团队的四路进攻，全歼一个侦缉大队，人数扩达数万，拥有机枪、重炮及迫击炮，活动十余县的广大地区。川、滇、黔边境民军，大小十余部，由十七位民军领袖合组“川滇黔总司令部”，由三千余人发展至万余人；黔湘鄂边境民军一部，以八面山为根据地，粉碎蒋匪多次进攻，现该部已设政治部，并订出化整为零、化零为整等作战方针；滇南人民武装许世好部由四六年数百人之小队扩展至五六千人，组成民主联军第一纵队，领导农民反对蒋匪征兵征粮暴政；闽中军分区司令黄国璋所部，于屡创蒋军取得不断胜利后，长驱南下，与闽南戴云纵队及活动于龙溪、安溪山地之王部民军胜利会师，时而合力出击，时而分散袭击，部队纪律严明，深得广大人民拥护。\n    （二）从单纯的军事斗争，进而摧毁蒋匪反动的统治机构，建立各级爱国民主政权，实施各种民主善政。如浙东四明山区人民武装建立了浙东行政公署及民主县政府，进行各种民主设施，领导群众抗丁抗粮；粤北南雄县境某部民军千余人，摧毁了三十余个蒋匪乡公所，建立了六个人民区政府，并发动群众进行分粮分田斗争；去年九月十一日出版之香港“群众周刊”载读者投书称：“粤、赣边境各县的农村，很多已摆脱蒋匪政权的统治，自力更生，实行减租减息，救济饥荒，过着安定向上的生活。”粤南化县、吴川除县城及六乡外，廉江、遂溪除三乡外，均已全部建立民主政权；粤桂民军则正筹组民主区政府，西康人民自卫军总部早在去年便提出组织“人民政府”。\n    （三）人民武装斗争的政治口号和目标，逐步的鲜明和提高。由抗丁抗粮、严惩贪官污吏，进而开仓济贫、打土豪分田地，掀起广泛的农民翻身运动。与广大人民建立了血肉关系，有的甚至明确提出反对美帝国主义侵华，打倒卖国贼蒋介石等口号。如桂东南黄末若领导的“民主联盟革命军”，号召实现民主、独立、和平，打倒法西斯卖国贼！向附近各县展开活动，所到之处，打恶霸分粮财，深得人民拥护。苏南常州人民武装，于去年十月二十三日夜，袭击七区钱家舍等村，将罪大恶极的四个恶霸大地主处决，人心大快；闽南人民武装在安溪县曾领导农民掀起反对季光第三百年来封建剥削的抗缴“相国租”运动；皖南人民，在民军胜利出击的影响下，郎溪离井乡二万多农民自动起来捉拿恶霸地主黄立鼎，分了三百多石谷子和大批衣服、农具。\n    随着今后解放军大反攻的胜利影响和中国土地法大纲的广泛传播，可以断言，蒋后广大农民的反封建斗争将会更进一步的发展和深入。也正由于民变武装的坚决保卫群众利益、大力帮助农民翻身，这就获得了广大人民的热烈拥护。如闽南人民武装某次召开干部会议，农民们自动起来担任警戒，监视坏分子，群众发现开会干部每日只用两顿稀粥糊口，便你一筐我一捆的送来地瓜、酱菜、豆角。为了壮大自己的武装，不少青年农民以自己出卖壮丁所得之款，献给民军购买武器，而自己又于最短期间携械逃回参加民军。\n    （四）为人民解放军全国大部分的胜利所鼓舞，有力配合解放军作战，蒋后人民武装纷纷大规模主动出击，由袭击蒋匪区乡保公所，进而攻略城镇，破坏蒋匪水陆运输交通线。如安徽之绩溪、泾县、茂林，浙江之昌化、衢州（浙赣路重镇），广西之武宣、贵县、横县、容县、滕县、森林、万岗，西康之雅安、天全、荣经，广东之深圳（在广九路上，美帝帮助蒋匪之内战武器多由此运入）、徐闻、大埔、南雄、始兴等城镇，均曾被民军袭击、围困和攻占；沪郊民军并曾一度攻入沪西四十里之蟠龙镇。蒋匪内战运输线广九、平汉、湘桂、浙赣、滇越等铁路，京芜（南京至芜湖）、京祁（南京至安徽祁门）、锡（无锡）澄（江阴）、青（浦）沪等公路，也不断遭受民军之威胁与攻击。去年十一月苏南民军配合大反攻，连续袭击锡澄公路，攻入西仓滇等地，并沿路展开广泛宣传，张贴“人民解放军大反攻”等标语，震破敌胆；皖南民军亦大举破袭京芜、芜屯两公路，逼近芜湖市郊，破毁芜屯公路，并拆除绩溪至宁口间之电线、桥梁，使得、宁间电讯中断；十一月十八日，人民武装破坏了美国援蒋补给线，粤汉铁路英德、曲江间大抗口铁桥，并截断英德以北的北江水上军运；这都给南下反攻的人民解放军以有力支持。\n    面对着人民武装的广泛出击，蒋匪大小官员们只是惊恐万状的“求援”、“告急”，毫无招架办法。\n    （五）蒋后民变武装，以农民、工人为领导，同时包括了广泛的阶层，也是一个显著的特点。其中除了广大工农群众为反抗蒋匪征兵征粮等暴政踊跃参加、成为民变武装的基干外，尚有知识分子、公务员、蒋军官兵及边疆的少数民族。如粤桂人民武装，均有大批知识分子参加；活动于丽江两岸的民军陈高和部，有“旧军官总队”队员一部参加；西康夷民为反抗蒋匪屠杀政策，纷起武装自卫；新疆人民反蒋自治运动，仍在持续发展中。而在人民武装的威力震慑及政治争取下，蒋匪地方保安团队不断起义投诚；如去年十月间，浙东定海芦蒲乡蒋匪自卫队戴文衡等九人起义，携轻机枪、手提机枪等十余支，投奔人民武装；八月间，粤北翁源民军对蒋军展开“召降运动”，仅一二个乡镇，即有百余名蒋记“自卫队”、“联防队”携械投诚。今后，随着战局的发展，蒋匪军更要大量被歼，蒋匪统治区更要日渐缩小；其兵源势必更加缺乏，财源势必更加枯竭，蒋匪为维持其垂死统治，又势必更加疯狂的征粮、抓丁、屠杀、镇压，这就必然激起人民更大更猛的反抗。可以预见：今后蒋区广大乡村的武装反蒋运动，将更普遍更炽烈的发展、巩固、壮大，并与大城市中工人、学生的爱国民主运动进一步结合，当人民解放大军胜利进军，渡江南下、攻城夺地之时，它将成为有力的先锋、向导和内应，直接配合作战，把“黑心头子”蒋介石的反动统治最后地结束！"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 28th: Moscow Dispatch: \"Izvestia\" published an article entitled \"The Victory of Planned Economy in New Democratic Countries,\" stating that South, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and other countries have basically completed their economic plans for last year. The article points out that the economic levels of new democratic countries are extremely uneven. Therefore, the tasks and goals are not entirely the same, but the implementation of the 1947 plan has three important and consistent results: First, it restored the wounds of war and revived their economies at a pace that Western capitalist countries could not achieve; Second, it eliminated economic and technological backwardness and rapidly moved towards industrialization; Third, it consolidated the economic and political independence of the countries. Poland lost 20 billion U.S. dollars in the war, but last year it produced about 60 million tons of coal, five times that of 1945. Last year, it exported 20 million tons of coal, which is a major contribution to the entire European recovery. Poland's steel industry exceeded pre-war production by 28.2 percent. Power plants exceeded 52 percent. Czechoslovakia took seven years to reach pre-war production levels after World War I, but this time, after the war, despite much greater losses than the previous time, it reached this goal within 30 months. The achievements of the recovery work are reflected in the improvement of the living standards of the masses. The real wages of Czech workers exceeded the 1938 index by 34 percent. Yugoslavia established 448 industrial factories last year, establishing its own steel plants, which is unprecedented in history. Bulgaria's industrial production increased by 67 percent compared to 1939. In Hungary, after stabilizing the currency the year before last, real wages increased by 50 percent compared to the pre-war index, and now it has reached 60 percent. The article concludes that the situation in Western Europe is just the opposite. Along with American \"aid\" comes economic and political enslavement.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 28th: Compiled from various sources: New democratic countries in Eastern Europe continue to vigorously develop the national economy and continue to achieve significant achievements. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, in view of the successful completion of last year's plan, specially called for \"completing the two-year plan ahead of schedule,\" which was enthusiastically responded to by all workers, launching a new wave of production. As of the 20th of this month, the steel industry has exceeded the plan by 2.3 percent, and the coal mining industry has exceeded it by 1.5 percent. Poland recently passed a new budget案 for 1948, in which expenditures increased by 86 percent compared to last year. According to Polish Minister of Industry and Commerce, Minc, under the new budget案, the planned output of cotton textiles this year will increase by 21.1 percent compared to last year, wool textiles by 25 percent, and leather shoes by 26 percent. Minc also described Poland's current abundant food situation, saying that the sugar industry produced 480,000 tons of sugar last year, an increase of 100,000 tons compared to the previous year. There are currently 600,000 tons of grain in storage, and it is estimated that grain can be self-sufficient this year. The development of animal husbandry can supply all the meat needed by the people. After three years of hard work and construction in Hungary after the war, coal production has recovered to 95 percent of pre-war levels, while steel production has exceeded pre-war levels. State-owned enterprises have developed greatly, and the number of workers employed accounts for two-thirds of the country's workers. Due to the general reduction in prices, workers' real wages have increased by 20 to 25 percent. Last year, foreign trade surprisingly had a surplus of 18 million Hungarian currency. Recently, it also passed the first balanced budget in many years. Romania has recently completed currency reforms to end inflation and improve people's lives. According to the President of the National Bank of Romania, the National Bank currently has enough U.S. dollars to guarantee the country's import plan, and the circulating currency has sufficient gold reserves, making Romania's currency extremely solid. Albania has not only healed the wounds of war, but also successfully completed the economic plan for 1947.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东欧各新民主国家计划经济胜利前进\n\n1948-01-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东欧各新民主国家计划经济胜利前进\n    【新华社陕北二十八日电】莫斯科讯：消息报发表专文，论“新民主国家计划经济的胜利”称：南、波、捷、匈、保等国，已基本上完成去年经济计划。该文指出：新民主国家的经济水平极不平衡。因此，任务和目标也不完全相同，可是一九四七年计划的执行，却有三个重要而一致的结果：第一、恢复了战争的创伤，并以西部资本主义国家办不到的步伐复兴它们的经济；第二、消灭经济和技术的落后，迅速走向工业化；第三、巩固了国家的经济和政治的独立。波兰在战争中损失二百亿美元，可是去年却生产了约六千万吨的煤，五倍于一九四五年，去年输出煤达二千万吨，这对整个欧洲复兴是一个重大的贡献。波兰的钢铁工业超过战前产量的百分之二八点二。动力厂超过百分之五十二。捷克在第一次世界大战后，经过七年才达到战前生产水平，而这次战后，损失虽比前次大得多，却在三十个月内就达到这一目标。复兴工作的成就反映在群众生活水平的提高上，捷克工人的实际工资超过一九三八年指数的百分之三十四。南斯拉夫去年建立了四四八所产业工厂，建立起自己的钢铁厂，这都是历史上空前的。保加利亚工业生产较一九三九年增加了百分之六十七。匈牙利在前年稳定币制后，实际工资较战前指数提高了百分之五十，现在则达到百分之六十。该文结语称：西欧的情形恰好相反，随着美国“援助”以俱来的，是经济与政治上的被奴役。\n    【新华社陕北二十八日电】综合各方讯：东欧新民主主义各国，继续大力发展国民经济，并不断获得重大之成就。捷克共产党中央委员会鉴于去年计划顺利完成，特号召“提前完成两年计划”，获得全体工人热烈响应，展开了新的生产热潮，至本月二十日止，钢铁工业已超过计划百分之二点三，煤矿工业超过百分之一点五。波兰于日前通过了一九四八年度新预算案，其中岁出较去年增加百分之八十六。据波兰工商部长明兹宣称：在新预算案下，计划今年的棉织品产量较去年将增加百分之廿一点一、毛织品百分之二十五、皮鞋百分之二十六。明兹并叙述波兰目前丰足的食品状况称：制糖工业去年产糖四十八万吨，比前年增加了十万吨，现存谷物六十万吨，估计今年谷物可以自给。畜牧业的发展，可以供给人民所需之全部肉食。匈牙利经战后三年的努力建设，使煤的产量已恢复到战前的百分之九十五，钢的产量则已超过战前水平。国营企业大大发展，雇用之工人已占全国工人的三分之二。由于物价的普遍降低，工人的实际工资已提高了百分之二十至二十五，去年全年对外贸易竟破天荒的出超一千八百万匈币，日前更通过了多年来第一次收支平衡的预算。罗马尼亚近已完成终止通货膨胀与改善人民生活的货币改革，据罗国家银行总理谈称：国家银行现存的美金，足以保证国家的输入计划，流通货币具有充分黄金准备，使罗国的货币极度巩固。阿尔巴尼亚不仅治愈了战争的创伤，而且胜利完成了一九四七年的经济计划。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Central Bureau Full District Land Conference Decides\n  　Mobilize Women to Participate in Equal Distribution\n    [Our News] In the land reform and self-defense war over the past year, the broad masses of women in the rural areas of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area have demonstrated great strength. At the district land conference held last October to December, women's work was elevated to an unprecedentedly important position. Comrade Yi Bo pointed out: Party committees at all levels should attach importance to women's work. Women's work should be elevated to a task for the entire Party, and it should not be regarded as the responsibility of only a few female comrades; every Party member should serve the broad masses of working women in the same way. He quoted Comrade Shaoqi's speech at the National Land Conference, saying: \"The working people will not be liberated if half of the people are not free.\" However, in the year and a half of land reform in Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, there were strange phenomena such as women not being allowed to leave the village and marriages requiring the approval of village cadres. Many poor and hired women actively participated in the anti-feudal struggle, but they received very little, and even less political fruit. These all proved that the broad masses of rural women, especially poor and hired women, had not completely turned over. Therefore, in the future, working women must be mobilized simultaneously in the equal distribution of land. If rural working women cannot be mobilized to participate in the equal distribution of land, the rural feudal forces cannot be completely eliminated. They should play the same role as men in land reform, large-scale production, and democratic movements. When a large number of young and middle-aged men join the army and participate in the war, it is even more necessary to cultivate women to replace men in various work positions in the rear. After the land reform, it is necessary to select activists from poor and hired women to participate in the government. Moreover, in this equal distribution of land movement, we should gradually solve many problems of women themselves and propose and formulate the program of the women's movement.\n    At the district land conference, the presidium of the conference specially elected Comrade Yang Zhihua of the Central Women's Committee to make a special speech on women's issues. Comrade Zhihua first introduced the importance that the National Land Conference in September 1947 attached to women's work and the reasons for this emphasis. She said: The working women of Taihang wove 7.4 million catties of cloth in 70 days. They made a great contribution to the supply of military and civilian clothing in the liberated areas. Women in various regions have demonstrated many touching heroic deeds in the movements to join the army, participate in the war, and make military uniforms and shoes. In particular, the working women of Jinnan performed very well in sending their husbands and sons to join the army this time. There were 2,007 female village chiefs in six counties in Shandong. In Qingfeng and Nanle of Ji-Lu-Yu, half of the militiamen were women. In Huguan County, the third sub-district of Taihang, there were 5,975 male activists and 4,531 female activists. When struggling against landlords, their complaints often played a leading role. When recovering hidden wealth, they could often bravely and meticulously break through the landlords' tricks... These all showed that women had made extremely important contributions to the patriotic self-defense war and land reform. As land reform becomes more in-depth and the self-defense war develops further, women will become an indispensable force in various movements and the management of political power. But why haven't the broad masses of working women received the attention they deserve, despite making such great contributions in the past? Comrade Zhihua conveyed the National Land Conference's review of women's work, and Comrade Deng Yingchao's self-criticism: \"Our class viewpoint, that is, the class line, in rural women's work in the past has been vague for a long time; in fact, we have been circling among landlord and rich peasant women above the middle peasant level, floating on the upper level, taking everything into our own hands, and thus became divorced from the basic masses.\" Comrade Zhihua then said: In the symposiums on women's issues in Jinnan, Taihang, and Taiyue districts, the comrades working on women's issues also unanimously reviewed: \"The object of women's work during the War of Resistance Against Japan were women who were eloquent and good at speaking, looking down on the vast laboring women who were illiterate and unable to speak, considering them to be \"backward,\" unable to leave their families, and unable to play a role; or one-sidedly emphasizing women's interests, leading to male-female opposition and disharmony between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. Because the women's movement became an isolated movement of a few people, it did not receive the sympathy of the broad masses. With the wrong line and policy, there were no achievements in the work, and women's work cadres also lost confidence in the women's movement.\" Comrade Liu Xiangping, secretary of the Shi Min County Party Committee in Taiyue (a female comrade), also reviewed the areas where she did not pay enough attention to women's work in her overall work. At the beginning of the district-wide land reform, some comrades split the mobilization of women and the mobilization of the masses into two stages. (Comrade Yibo also said in the conclusion of the district land conference: A great land reform that abandons half of the population, women, will not be thorough, and the task will not be completed. At the same time, it is a complete fantasy to expect women, who have been oppressed by feudalism for thousands of years, to get improvement and liberation in this great movement and then wait for the movement to pass before carrying out a political, economic, and ideological transformation.) Comrade Zhihua further explained: Because the Party is impure, it affects the ability of poor and hired women to stand up, and men and women cannot be equal. She reviewed the two different ideologies and two different lines—opportunism and anti-opportunism—in the women's movement, both past and present, both inside and outside the Party. She said: Only by taking up the unique weapon of the Communist Party, self-criticism and criticism, thoroughly settling our own thoughts, and eliminating the landlord, rich peasant, bourgeois, petty-bourgeois, and rogue proletariat's views of women that corrode the women's movement, can we honestly grasp Chairman Mao's proletarian thought and remove the stones left over from history and mixed into the proletarian ranks in society. Only Chairman Mao's central line is the line of victory.\n    What is this correct and victorious line? She said: That is, the conference has determined that the poor and hired peasants should be the backbone, unite the middle peasants and other anti-feudal elements, thoroughly implement the equal distribution of land, and eliminate the landlord class. Only with this clear line can we guarantee the liberation of the broad masses of working women, and can we guarantee the realization of women's four basic demands—land, democracy, freedom of marriage, and equality between men and women. Only when women gain economic, political, and ideological fruits of struggle in the movement to eliminate feudalism and the landlord class can they completely turn over. All cadres of our Party must show the highest degree of enthusiasm to care for the liberation of women, who account for half of the population.\n    Comrade Zhihua especially reminded everyone not to repeat the bureaucracy and coercion of past work; to go deep among the poor and hired women, mingle with them, listen to their opinions, and become familiar with and understand their pain and demands. It is necessary to specifically explain the Land Law Outline to them, tell them that women and men share an equal share of land and enjoy the same democracy, and encourage their enthusiasm. It is necessary to inspire them to pursue their roots of poverty and turn over and complain of suffering, so as to distinguish themselves from landlords and rich peasants and achieve a thorough turnaround. After land reform, attention should be paid to organizing women to participate in production, especially agriculture and textiles. They should be trained in various production skills and knowledge of class struggle. Various tasks to support the front require better organization of women's participation.\n    Comrade Zhihua said: Leading organs at all levels should systematically cultivate and promote activists from poor and hired women and female workers to various leading positions. They should be patiently helped to solve various difficulties and trained in their ability to handle affairs. Female cadres with intellectual backgrounds should go deep into the countryside and participate in practical work at the grassroots level. This will enable them to receive education and transformation from the masses in the great land reform movement and become a long-term worker who is good at serving the people. For individual female cadres who do not seek progress, leading organs at all levels should urge, educate, and struggle against them, and should not adopt a liberal attitude.\n    Finally, Comrade Zhihua told everyone: Our women's work must be combined with the overall tasks of the Party and the work arrangements of various departments, and at the same time, we must have confidence in women's work. The National Land Conference produced a great charter that broke the feudal system that has existed for thousands of years—the Chinese Land Law Outline. This is the most powerful weapon to defeat the enemy. With this weapon, we should have unwavering confidence in victory. We call on the oppressed women, who make up half of the population, to actively support the Chinese Land Law.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中央局全区土地会议决定　发动妇女参加平分\n\n1948-01-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中央局全区土地会议决定\n  　发动妇女参加平分\n    【本报消息】晋冀鲁豫解放区农村广大妇女，在一年多土地改革与自卫战争中，表现了伟大的力量。在去年十至十二月全区土地会议上，妇女工作被提到前所未有的重要地位。一波同志指出：党的各级领导机关，应重视妇女工作。应把妇女工作提高成为全党的任务，不应把它看成只是少数女同志的责任，每个党员都应同样为广大的劳动妇女服务。并引少奇同志在全国土地会议上的发言说：“人民中还有一半人不自由，劳动人民是不会得到解放的。”而晋冀鲁豫在一年半的土改运动中，还有不准妇女出村、婚姻要经村干批准等怪现象。许多贫雇妇女积极参加了反封建斗争，但给她们的东西却很少，政治果实则更少。这些都证明广大农村妇女，尤其贫雇妇女，尚未彻底翻身。因此，今后要在平分土地运动中同时发动劳动妇女。如果不能发动起农村劳动妇女来参加平分土地运动，农村封建势力就不可能彻底消灭。她们在土改中，在大生产，在民主运动中都应该和男子起同样的作用。当着大批青壮年参军参战时，更要培养妇女在后方的各个工作岗位上代替男子。土改后要选拔贫雇妇女积极分子参加政权。并要在此次平分土地运动中，逐渐解决妇女本身的许多问题和提出及制定妇女运动的纲领。\n    在全区土地会议上，大会主席团特推选中央妇委杨之华同志作妇女问题的专题发言。之华同志首先介绍了四七年九月全国土地会议对妇女工作的重视及重视的原因。她说：太行的劳动妇女，七十天内织布七百四十万斤。她们对解放区军需民用的被服供给，是有很大贡献的。各区妇女在参军、参战、做军衣军鞋等运动中，都表现了许多可歌可泣的英雄事迹。特别是冀南的劳动妇女，这次送郎送子参军，表现的很好。山东六县即有女村长两千零七人。冀鲁豫清丰、南乐有二分之一的民兵是妇女。太行三分区壶关县男积极分子有五千九百七十五人，女的有四千五百三十一人。在斗争地主时，她们的诉苦往往起了带头作用。在追索浮财时，她们经常能很勇敢、很细致的击破地主的诡计……。这些都说明了妇女对爱国自卫战争，对土地改革均有极重要的贡献。以后土地改革更加深入，自卫战争更加发展，妇女在各种运动及管理政权方面，将更成为不可缺少的力量。但是为什么广大的劳动妇女过去有这样大的贡献，却没有得到应有的重视呢？之华同志转达了全国土地会议对妇女工作的检讨，及邓颖超同志的自我批评说：“我们过去在农村妇女工作中的阶级观点，即阶级路线，是长期模糊的；实际是在中农以上的地主富农妇女中兜圈子，浮在上层，包办代替，因而脱离了基本群众。”之华同志接着说：在冀南、太行、太岳各区的妇女问题座谈会中，妇女工作同志们也一致的检讨出：“抗战中的妇女工作，是以能说会道的妇女为工作对象，看不起那些不识字不会说的广大劳动妇女力量，认为她们“落后”，离不开家庭，起不了作用；或是片面的强调妇女利益，发生男女对立，婆媳不和现象。由于妇女运动成为少数人孤立的运动，得不到广大群众的同情。路线方针错了，工作没有成绩，妇女工作干部也就失掉对妇运的信心。”太岳士敏县委书记刘湘屏同志（系女同志），也检讨了自己在全面工作中注意妇女工作不够的地方。在全区土地改革开始时，有些同志把发动妇女与发动群众分裂成两个阶段。（一波同志在全区土地会议的结论中也说：伟大的土地改革，丢掉占人口一半的妇女，运动是不会彻底的，任务也是完不成的。同时受了几千年封建压迫的妇女，不能在这个大运动中得到提高、解放，而要等待运动过去了再来个政治、经济、思想上的翻身运动，完全是幻想。）之华同志又说明：因党内不纯，影响贫雇妇女不能抬头，男女不能平等。她检讨了过去和现在妇女运动中在党内党外有两种不同的思想，有两种不同的路线——机会主义与反机会主义的路线。她说：只有拿起共产党所特有的武器，自我批评与批评，彻底清算自己的思想，清除腐蚀妇女运动的地主富农、资产阶级、小资产阶级以及流氓无产阶级的妇女观点，这样才能老老实实掌握毛主席的无产阶级思想，才能够搬掉历史上遗留下来的、社会上混进无产阶级队伍中来的石头。只有毛主席中央的路线是胜利的路线。\n    这个正确的胜利的路线是什么呢？她说：即大会已确定的要以贫雇为骨干，团结中农及其他反封建分子，彻底实行平分土地，消灭地主阶级。有了这个明确的路线，才能保证广大劳动妇女的解放，才能保证实现妇女四大基本要求——土地、民主、婚姻自主自由及男女平等。妇女只有在消灭封建消灭地主阶级的运动中，获得了经济上、政治上、思想上的斗争果实，才能彻底翻身。我党一切干部要用最高度的热忱来关心占人口一半的妇女的解放。\n    之华同志特别提醒大家，不要重复过去工作中的官僚主义、强迫命令；要深入贫雇妇女中，和她们打成一片，倾听她们的意见，熟悉和了解她们的痛苦与要求。要具体的给她们解释土地法大纲，告诉她们妇女和男子同样分得一份土地，同样享受民主，鼓励她们的积极性。要启发她们追穷根，翻身诉苦，以便和地主富农分清界限，达到彻底翻身。土改以后，要注意组织妇女参加生产，特别是农业和纺织业。要训练她们各种生产技能，和阶级斗争的知识。各种支前工作，需要更好的组织妇女参加。\n    之华同志说：各级领导机关，应有计划的培养提拔贫雇妇女和女工积极分子到各种领导岗位上来。要耐心的帮助她们解决各种困难，训练她们的办事能力。知识分子的女干部，应深入到农村中去，参加下层实际工作。使自己能在伟大的土地改革运动中得到群众的教育、改造，作一个善于为人民服务的长工。对于个别的不求进步的妇女干部，各级领导机关加以督促、教育、斗争，不能采取自由主义的态度。\n    最后，之华同志告诉大家：我们的妇女工作，必需在党的总任务之下，结合各部门工作布置，同时对于妇女工作，必须具备信心。全国土地会议产生了一个打破几千年历史封建制度的大宪章——中国土地法大纲，这是战胜敌人最有力的武器，我们有了这个武器，就应该有不动摇的胜利信心。我们号召占人口半数的被压迫妇女积极起来拥护中国土地法。"

    "content": "Lenin's words were a guide for the entire Soviet people to achieve victory in the socialist revolution, aimed at the then-Soviet revolutionary situation. In commemorating Lenin, every cadre should study Lenin's basic spirit of relying on poor and hired peasants and uniting with middle peasants as a reference for studying Chairman Mao's report and the Land Law Outline.\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　—The Editor\n\nOnly the proletariat can be the fighter who thoroughly struggles for democracy. Only under the condition that the peasant masses join the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat can the proletariat become the victorious fighter in the struggle for democracy. (Lenin: \"Two Tactics\")\n　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　×\n...When we encounter a class like the middle peasants, we find that it is a wavering class. On the one hand, the middle peasant is a private owner, and on the other hand, he is a laborer. He does not exploit other laborers. For decades, the middle peasant has guarded his position with extreme difficulty. He has endured the exploitation of landlords and capitalists, and endured everything. However, he is ultimately a private owner. Therefore, we have many difficulties in our attitude towards this wavering class. More than a year of experience, more than six months of the proletariat's work in the countryside, and the fact that the class has begun to differentiate in the countryside, make us feel that the most important thing is to prohibit impatience, to prohibit clumsy theoretical empty talk, and to prohibit treating things that are being completed but have not yet been completed as if they have been completed.\n\n...Compulsion used on middle peasants is very harmful. This is a huge class, including millions of individuals. Even in Europe, where industry is the most prosperous, technology and culture, urban life and railways are exceptionally developed, it is easiest to make such assumptions. However, even there, not a single one of the most revolutionary socialists has ever proposed the use of compulsory methods against middle peasants....\n\nCompulsory methods are completely ineffective here, and we should particularly emphasize this truth. This is economic work, which is a completely different matter, because there is no superstructure that can be eliminated, while the foundation remains firmly in place. In the city, the capitalist represents that superstructure, but there are no such capitalists here. Therefore, compulsory methods here will destroy the entire revolutionary cause. What is needed here is long-term educational work....\n\n...In a word, the most foolish thing is the idea of using coercive measures in the economic relations of the middle peasants. (Lenin: \"Collected Essays on Rural Work\")\n　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　×\n\nThe first question that is often asked is: what is a middle peasant?\n\nNaturally, party comrades often mention how they have been asked in the countryside what a middle peasant is. Our answer to this question is: one who does not exploit the labor of others, does not rely on the labor of others to live, does not use the fruits of the labor of others in any form, but works and lives entirely by his own labor is a middle peasant.\n\nUnder the capitalist system, there were fewer such peasants than there are now, because at that time, the majority of peasants belonged to the poor and impoverished class, and as now, only a very small number belonged to the exploiting, rich peasant class.\n\nSince the abolition of private land ownership, the number of middle peasants is now growing. The Soviet government has firmly decided to establish a completely peaceful and harmonious relationship with the middle peasants at all costs. It goes without saying that the middle peasant cannot immediately accept socialism, because he sticks to old habits and is hesitant about all innovations. Unless he has first tested it in practice in the actions he is invited to participate in, and is convinced of the necessity of change, he will never change his way of life.\n\nTherefore, what we must understand, remember, and implement is that when worker-Communist Party members appear in the countryside, their responsibility is to seek and establish comradely relations with the middle peasants; their responsibility is to remember that a laborer who does not exploit the labor of others is a comrade of the workers, and we can and should inspire each other with sincerity and mutual trust to achieve a spontaneous and voluntary alliance. Any measure proposed by the Communist government should only be regarded as advice, as an indication to the middle peasants, and as an exhortation to the middle peasants to adopt the new system.\n\nOnly by actually testing these methods through joint work, examining their shortcomings, correcting possible mistakes, and obtaining coordination with the middle peasants - only such work can guarantee the alliance of workers and peasants, which is the main force and fortress of the Soviet government; this alliance is a guarantee that the cause of socialist reform, the cause of overcoming capitalism and abolishing all forms of exploitation, can be victoriously completed. (Lenin: \"What is a Middle Peasant\")\n　　　×　　　ότερος　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　×\nIn the countryside, our task is to eliminate the landlords and break the resistance of exploiters and rich peasant speculators; in order to do this, we can only firmly rely on the semi-proletariat, rely on the poor peasants. But the middle peasant is not our enemy. He has wavered in the past, is wavering now, and will waver in the future; the task of influencing waverers is not the same as the task of overthrowing exploiters and defeating active enemies. Being good at reaching an agreement with the middle peasants—while not giving up the struggle with the rich peasants for even a minute and only firmly relying on the poor peasants—this is the practical task, because it is precisely now, due to the reasons mentioned above, that the middle peasant is turning to our side, which is inevitable. (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 23)\n　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×\nThe fundamental contradiction between us and our opponents lies in the understanding of the question of what is order and what is law. Until now, it has always been considered that whatever facilitates the landlords and officials is good order and law, while our claim is that whatever facilitates the majority of peasants is good order and law! Until the All-Russian Soviet Congress or the Constituent Assembly is established, any local power, whether it is a county committee or a provincial committee, is the highest order and law! We believe that a landlord demanding to conclude \"voluntary\" consultations with three hundred peasant families—each family averaging only seven and a half *desiatinas* of land—based on centuries-old privileges, is a usurpation of power! We say: \"Let all decisions be passed by the majority; we want the peasants to take the land of the landlords at this moment, without delaying for a month, a week, or a day!\" (Selected Works of Lenin, Volume 11, Part 2)\n　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　×\n…………The objective conditions of China, a backward, agricultural, and semi-feudal country, put on the agenda of the lives of four to five hundred million people only a certain, historically specific form of this oppression and exploitation (the oppression and exploitation of the masses—Editor)—feudalism. Feudalism was built on agricultural life and the dominance of the natural economy; the source of the feudal exploitation suffered by Chinese peasants is the fact that they are bound to the land in this or that form.\n…………………………\nIn the most backward peasant country in Asia, this most advanced bourgeois-democratic land program is popular. What economic necessity caused this? It is the necessity to destroy all kinds of feudalism.\n\nThe more China lags behind Europe and Japan, the greater the danger of division and national disintegration. Only the heroism of the revolutionary masses can \"renovate\" China, create the \"Republic of China\" in politics, and implement nationalization of land to ensure the fastest capitalist progress. (Lenin: \"Democracy and Populism in China\")\n　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　×\n\nLead the entire people, especially the peasants, to fight for complete freedom, for a thorough democratic revolution, and for the republic! Lead all laborers and exploited people to fight for socialism! The policy of the revolutionary proletariat should be such in fact; the class slogan—the class slogan that the workers' party should use to implement and determine every tactical problem and every practical step during the revolutionary period—is such. (Lenin: \"Two Tactics\")\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 列宁论依靠贫农联合中农\n\n1948-01-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　列宁论依靠贫农联合中农\n    列宁的这些话，是针对着当时苏联革命情况，指导全苏联人民取得社会主义革命的胜利指南，我们纪念列宁，每个干部都应当研究列宁关于依靠贫雇农团结中农的基本精神，作为学习毛主席报告及土地法大纲的一个参考。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    只有无产阶级，才能是为民主制而彻底奋斗的战士。只有在农民群众加入无产阶级的革命斗争的条件之下，无产阶级才能成为在为民主制而奋斗中获得胜利的战士。（列宁：“两个策略”）\n    　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　×\n    ……当我们遇到象中农这样一个阶层的时候，我们便发现，它是一个动摇的阶级，中农一方面是私有主，另一方面又是劳动者。他不剥削别的劳动者。几十年来中农极其艰苦地把守着自己的地位，他忍受过地主资本家的剥削，忍受过一切。可是，他终究是一个私有主。因此，我们对于这个动摇阶级的态度，便有许多困难。由于一年多的经验，由于六个多月无产阶级在乡村中的工作，并由于乡村中阶级已开始分化的事实，使我们感到最重要的事情是应该禁止急躁，禁止拙劣的理论空谈，以及禁止把正在完成着还没有完成的事情，当作已经完成了的事情。\n    ……强迫用之于中农是非常有害的。这是一个数目庞大的阶层，包括着千百万个个人。甚至产业最兴盛的欧洲，技术和文化、城市生活和铁路都异常发达，最易使人作如此想。可是，就在那里，最革命的社会主义者也没有一个人曾提议过对中农采用强迫的办法。………\n    强迫办法在这里是全无成效的，我们应该特别强调这个真理。这里是经济工作，它全然是另一回事情，因为这里并没有那种上层建筑物，可以把它消除，而建筑的基础仍稳固勿动。在城市里，代表那种上层建筑的就是资本家，而这里是没有那种资本家的。所以，强迫办法在这里就要破坏全部革命事业。这里所需要的是长期的教育工作。……\n    ……一句话，最愚蠢的就是在中农的经济关系上使用强制手段的观念。（列宁：“农村工作论文集”）\n    　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　×\n    首先常常要问的问题是：什么是中农呢？\n    自然，党的同志们常常提到，他们曾如何在农村中被问过什么是中农的问题。对于这个问题我们的回答是：不剥削别人的劳动，不依靠别人的劳动来生活，不以任何形式利用别人的劳动果实，而全凭自己的劳动来工作和生活的，就是中农。\n    这样的农民在资本主义制度下比较现在少，因为那时大多数的农民是属于穷苦的贫民阶层，和现在一样，那时只有极少数是属于剥削者、富农阶层的。\n    自从土地私有制废除以来，现在中农正在增长着。苏维埃政府已毅然决定，无论如何要和中农建立完全和平融洽的关系。不言而喻的，中农决不能马上就接受社会主义，因为他墨守旧习，对于一切革新，都迟疑不定，如果不首先在实际上在被邀参加的行动中考验过，并确信了有改变的必要时，决不改变其生活方式。\n    因此，我们所必须了解，必须牢记及实行的，即工人共产党员在乡村中出现的时候，他们的责任就在于觅取和中农的同志关系，建立和中农的同志关系；他们的责任就在于牢记着，一个不剥削别人劳动的劳动者，就是工人的同志，我们能够而且应该以真诚互信相感召，达到自发自愿的联盟。共产主义政府所提出的任何办法，只应看作是忠告，看作是对中农的一个指示，看作是告诉中农应该采用新制度的一种劝告罢了。\n    只有在实际上以共同工作来考验这些办法，审查它们的缺点，改正可能的错误，获得和中农的协调——只有这样的工作，才能够保证工人和农民的联盟，这个联盟，是苏维埃政府的主要力量和堡垒；这个联盟是一个保证，是社会主义改革事业，战胜资本主义和取消一切剥削形式的事业能够胜利完成的一个保证。（列宁：“什么是中农”）\n    　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　×\n    在乡村里，我们的任务就是消灭地主，打破剥削者和富农投机家的反抗；为要做到这一点，我们只能坚固的依靠半无产者，依靠贫农。可是中农不是我们的敌人。他过去动摇过，现在动摇着，将来还会动摇；影响动摇者的任务与推倒剥削者及战胜积极敌人的任务，并不是一样的。善于达到与中农的协定，——同时连一分钟也不放弃与富农的斗争和只是坚固的依靠着贫农——这是现实的任务，因为正是现在，由于上述的那些原因，中农转向到我们这方面来，乃是必不可免的事情。（列宁全集第二十三卷）\n    　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×\n    在我们和我们的敌对者之间的基本的矛盾，是在对于什么是秩序以及什么是法律这个问题的理解上。迄今为止，一向都认为凡便利于地主与官吏的，便是良好的秩序与法律，而我们的主张则是，凡便利于大多数农民的，便是良好的秩序与法律！直至全俄苏维埃会议或立宪会议成立时为止，地方上的任何政权，不论其为县委员会也好，或省委员会也好，都是最高的秩序与法律！我们认为，一个地主，根据旧的若干世纪以来的特权，要求和三百个农民家庭——其中每户平均起来，仅有七俄亩半的土地——订立“自愿的”协商，那才是一种对于权力的僭越呢！我们说：“让一切决定都由大多数来通过罢；我们要农民不要耽搁一月、一星期、或一天，而在此刻就拿到地主的土地！（列宁选集卷十一下册）\n    　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　×\n    …………中国这一个落后的、农业的、半封建的国家之客观的条件，提在四五万万人民的生活日程上的，只是这种压迫与剥削（对群众的压迫与剥削——编者）的一个一定的，历史上特殊的形式——封建制度。封建制度曾建筑在农业生活及自然经济的统治上；中国农民所受的封建式的剥削的来源，就是它在这种或那种形式下被束缚于土地这个事实。\n    …………………………\n    在亚洲一个最落后的农民国家里，流行着这种最先进的资产阶级民主主义的土地纲领，这是什么经济上的必要性所引起的呢？这就是毁坏各种各色的封建制度之必要性。\n    中国越落在欧洲与日本之后，便越有四分五裂和民族解体的危险。只有革命的人民大众的英雄主义，才能“维新”中国，在政治方面创造“中华民国”，在土地方面实行国有化以保证最快的资本主义的进步。（列宁：“中国的民主主义与民粹主义”）\n    　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　×\n    领导全体人民，特别是领导农民来为完全自由、为彻底民主革命、为共和国而奋斗！领导一切劳动者和被剥削者来为社会主义而奋斗！革命无产阶级的政策，在事实上就应当是如此；阶级口号，——工人党在革命时期中应当用以贯彻和规定每个策略问题决定和每个实际步骤的阶级口号，——就是如此。（列宁：“两个策略”）"

In fighting Chiang Kai-shek, although women could not carry guns to the front, they did important things in the rear, such as making military shoes, grinding rice and flour, and carrying stretchers. It would also be difficult to carry out the struggle against landlords without women. This is because women account for half of the peasant population in the entire border region, and they were greatly oppressed in the past. The Central Bureau's land conference clearly stipulated that women should also be emancipated when land is equally distributed in the future. In the past, when organizing women, we only paid attention to those who were clever, eloquent, and good at speaking, which resulted in landlords' and rich peasants' wives becoming leaders. This time, we must change the method and first organize poor women. Women should also participate in the poor peasant leagues. After the poor women are organized, they should unite with the middle peasant women and participate in the peasant association. The peasant association should set up a women's department. Women should also participate in land distribution.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, January 25th: The Shandong Provincial Government announced eight prohibitions and ten requirements before New Year's Day, ordering everyone to publicize and every village to implement them in order to reduce the people's burden, actively engage in production and thrift, get through the spring famine, ensure the completion of land reform, and strive for victory in the people's revolutionary war.\n\nThe eight prohibitions are: 1. Ban extravagant eating and drinking; simplify banquets and gift-giving. Practice thrift and learn from poor peasants in all aspects of life. 2. Ban apportionment; prohibit all extra burdens. All village finances must be discussed, inspected, and supervised by the masses and approved by governments above the county level. 3. No conscription is allowed without the decision of the military region or the provincial government. 4. Ban raising money for comfort missions. 5. Ban private occupation of floating wealth and fruits; ban corruption, waste, destruction, occupation, transfer, or theft of floating wealth and public property. Offenders will be punished with hard labor and compensation. 6. Ban the slaughter and injury of draught cattle and the destruction of farm tools. 7. Ban the free assignment of labor, wasting people's strength, and freezing labor. From now on, the mobilization and use of civilian labor must comply with government regulations. All frozen labor must be sent back to production. 8. Ban corruption, waste, and loss of public grain and public grass; ban false reporting and excessive collection. From now on, those who are found to have falsely reported and excessively collected public grain and public grass will be held accountable along with the leaders of the affiliated agency. Finally, it is stipulated that any citizen has the democratic right to report and supervise violations of the prohibitions, and those who infringe on this democratic right will be punished twice as severely.\n\nThe ten requirements are: 1. Disaster areas (i.e., areas once occupied and ravaged by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits) should eat bran and wild herbs in winter to save grain, so that there will be grain to plant and work in the fields next spring. 2. Every household should plant spring vegetables early to supplement grain, so as not to regret it when there is a shortage of grain and vegetables. 3. Fields and spring land should be planted with vegetables in stages, so as not to have another disaster when the old crops run out and the new crops are not yet ready. 4. Protect elm, willow, poplar, and locust trees, so there will be tree vegetables to eat next spring. 5. Plant more spring wheat and spring corn, so that the summer wheat will not fail and affect the autumn harvest. 6. Government agencies and troops should help more in their spare time, and the masses should not comfort them with every meal or drop of porridge. 7. Every household should practice thrift and develop production, and not just eat today without regard for tomorrow. 8. Hired and poor peasants should share the fruits of struggle, and cadres should not be corrupt or monopolize them. 9. Understand that the fruits of struggle are originally the blood and sweat of hired and poor peasants, and should not be regarded as external wealth and used improperly. 10. Organize cattle raising and make cattle available fairly, so that cattle owners do not suffer losses and sell their cattle, leaving land without cattle to plow.\n\nXinhua News Agency, East China, January 25th: Cadres of organs in the Binhai area have begun to respond to the Shandong Provincial Government's eight prohibitions and ten requirements. The Binhai Pictorial has published a special issue to publicize them in depth. After receiving the prohibitions, the Ju County government immediately reprinted and distributed them, and required all villages to hold discussions and reflections in winter schools to achieve implementation in every village. The Cultural and Education Office of Rizhao County compiled the prohibitions into songs and sent them to elementary schools to teach the masses. Cadres of district offices in Jufeng District and Luyang District of Zhuting (newly established county, formerly Ganyu County) reviewed themselves based on the prohibitions and formulated future production and thrift plans. After studying the prohibitions, cadres of the southern border area of Ju (County) turned over all of their three-month surplus vegetable money, more than 40,000 yuan, and more than 700 jin of coarse grains to the public. Cadres and militiamen in Dadian Town, Dadian District, automatically proposed to strictly prohibit extravagant eating and drinking and immediately carried manure baskets to engage in production. Cadres in Pingshang Village collectively quit drinking and made self-criticisms to the villagers, asking for their supervision.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 山东省政府提倡节约　村村推行八项禁令\n\n1948-01-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　山东省政府提倡节约\n  　村村推行八项禁令\n    【新华社华东二十五日电】山东省政府于元旦前公布八项禁令与十项要求，通令人人宣传，村村执行。以减轻人民负担，积极进行生产节约，度过春荒，保证完成土地改革，争取人民革命战争的胜利。\n    八项禁令为：一、禁止大吃大喝，请客送礼从简。省吃俭用，一切生活要向雇贫农看齐。二、禁止摊派，禁止一切额外负担，一切村财政必须经群众讨论检查监督，并由县以上政府批准。三、非经军区省府决定，不得动员参军。四、禁止募捐慰劳。五、禁止私占浮财及果实，禁止贪污浪费、破坏、霸占、转让、盗卖浮财及公物，犯者一律罚苦工偿还。六、禁止宰杀、伤害耕牛，破坏农具。七、禁止自由派夫浪费民力及冻结民力，今后动员使用民工必须遵守政府法规，已冻结民力一律遣回生产。八、禁止贪污、浪费、耗失公粮、公草；禁止虚报多领，今后查出虚报多领公粮、公草者，以该所属机关所属首长是问。最后并规定：如有违犯禁令者，任何公民均有检举监督告发的民主权利，侵犯此民主权利者加倍处罚。\n    十项要求为：一、要灾区（即曾被蒋匪侵占蹂躏的地区）冬天吃糠咽菜省粮食，不要来春种地干活没粮吃。二、要家家早种春菜顶粮食，不要到时缺粮无菜后悔迟。三、要场园、春地分期多种菜，不要青黄不接又成灾。四、要爱护榆、柳、杨树和洋槐，不要来春没得树头菜。五、要多种春麦、春棒子，不要二麦短收不接秋。六、要机关部队业余多帮助，不要群众慰劳一饭一粥。七、要家家省吃检用发展生产，不要今天吃了不管明天。八、要雇贫农分得斗争果实，干部不得贪污把持。九、要明白斗争果实原是雇贫农自己的血汗，不要当成外财用的不得当。十、要组织养牛，使牛要公平，不要牛主吃亏出卖，有地无牛耕。\n    【新华社华东二十五日电】滨海机关干部已开始响应山东省政府八项禁令十项要求，滨海画报特出专刊深入宣传。莒县县政府接了禁令后，立即翻印散发，并要求各村在冬学中座谈讨论及反省，达到村村执行。日照县文教处将禁令编成歌调，发到各小学教会群众。巨峰区及竹庭（新设县原赣榆县）卢阳等区公所干部根据禁令检讨自己，并订出今后生产节约计划。莒（县）南部边区公所干部学习禁令后，将三个月结余菜金四万余元和粗粮七百余斤全部缴公。大店区大店镇村干部和民兵自动提出保证严戒大吃大喝，并立即背起粪筐生产。坪上村干部集体戒酒，并向全村群众检讨，要求监督。"

    "date": "1948-01-30",

    "content": "Thorough Land Redistribution and New Tasks for Women's Work\n    Deng Yingchao\n\n    In the past two years, under the leadership of our Party, the peasants in the liberated areas have carried out a vigorous land reform movement and achieved great victories. Tens of millions of landless and land-poor peasants and the broad masses of rural working women have been involved in this movement. They have destroyed the feudal forces in the countryside that had existed for thousands of years. They have not only acquired land and means of production but have also greatly raised their class consciousness and political enthusiasm. Therefore, they have turned themselves over economically and politically. In particular, the great strength of working women has been more clearly demonstrated in this movement. They have shown unprecedented scale and heroic posture in various anti-feudal struggles in the land reform movement, on the production front, in supporting the front and undertaking rear service work, and in various work positions in the countryside replacing men. In the struggle against landlords, their suffering often played a leading role. In pursuing the hidden wealth of landlords, they often carefully and meticulously broke the enemy's tricks in places that ordinary people easily overlooked. In some areas, men fought Chiang Kai-shek's troops at the front, while women distributed land and dug up Chiang's roots in the rear. In some areas, the broad masses of women have become the main force of production; in some areas, working women have stood in positions of power in the countryside; in some areas, women have made significant contributions to supporting the front, such as making shoes, sewing clothes, milling flour, husking rice, short-distance transportation, and caring for the wounded and sick. These all illustrate that women are an extremely important force that cannot be ignored in reforming the land system and in the patriotic self-defense war. Therefore, mobilizing the broad masses of working women to actively participate in land reform is an indispensable and extremely important component of the entire movement. Facts tell us that without mobilizing the rural working women to participate in land reform, it is impossible to completely and thoroughly eliminate feudal remnants.\n\n    However, the Party committees in various liberated areas have not paid enough attention to mobilizing and leading women to participate in land reform. Except for a few areas where there is a clear understanding and active, conscious, and planned attention is given, women's work is generally neglected, spontaneous, and without leadership. Therefore, the National Land Conference, in summing up the experience of land reform in the past two years, emphasized that in order to thoroughly redistribute land and eliminate feudal forces in the future, the Party's leadership organs at all levels must enhance and strengthen women's work.\n\n    Recently, the Central Committee of our Party promulgated the \"Outline Land Law of China,\" which, based on the demands of the peasants and the experience of land reform, stipulates the elimination of feudal and semi-feudal exploitation of the land system and the implementation of a land system where those who till the land own it. The promulgation of this land law outline, which has great historical significance, will set off a more enthusiastic and magnificent high tide of the land revolution movement among millions of peasants, especially in the liberated areas. Party committees at all levels must attract broad masses of rural working women to actively participate in this great revolutionary movement, calling on women to unite closely with the broad masses of peasants for their own liberation, in order to form a strong force to launch and implement the land reform movement and complete the basic tasks of the Chinese revolution.\n\n    Therefore, in order to achieve this goal, the National Land Conference, based on the experience of land reform in various liberated areas, emphasized that the following points should be given special attention in current women's work:\n\n    (1) Take land reform as the center, integrate women's work with land reform, and integrate the women's movement with the peasant movement. The close combination of the two can promote each other and complement each other. Rural working women and other peasants suffer from the exploitation and oppression of the landlord class and have common demands and common interests. Therefore, in the movement to thoroughly redistribute land in various places, it is necessary to mobilize the rural working women at the same time as mobilizing the peasant masses. There should be no distinction between prioritizing men and subordinating women, let alone the practice of casually bringing them along or taking advantage of them, or abandoning or avoiding the work of deeply mobilizing the broad masses of poor and hired peasant women under various pretexts such as backwardness, verbosity, trouble, annoyance, and difficulty, causing women's work to fall into a state of spontaneity and drift.\n\n    (2) In mobilizing and organizing rural women, poor and hired peasant women should be the backbone, uniting middle peasant women, and implementing the mass line in all aspects. In the past, the class viewpoint and class line in rural women's work were long blurred, and in practice, it revolved around landlord and rich peasant women above the middle peasant level, floated on the upper level, monopolized and replaced, and thus became detached from the basic rural women masses. This error must be corrected in the future. We should go deep into the masses of poor and hired peasant women, work patiently and meticulously, become one with them, understand and understand their sufferings and demands, and wholeheartedly serve them. Start with older and middle-aged women first, and use methods such as turning hearts, telling sufferings, dividing classes, tracing the roots of poverty, comparing sufferings, comparing prospects, and comparing days to enlighten their class consciousness and make them distinguish themselves from landlords and rich peasants. In the movement, special attention should be paid to cultivating and promoting women activists to participate in various leadership positions. At the same time, the \"Outline Land Law\" should be more widely publicized and explained among the peasant and women masses, and this outline should be effectively implemented to truly ensure that women receive land in the same way as men and have ownership. When distributing floating wealth, attention should be paid to the different needs between men and women and families, so that women can raise their interest in land from their love of floating wealth, and raise their awareness of the interests of the entire class from their personal demands. Unite with all the oppressed peasants to eliminate the common enemy—the landlord class. Only in this way can millions of women be bravely engaged in the movement of thoroughly redistributing land to eliminate the feudal exploitation of the land system and achieve thorough economic and political liberation.\n\n    (3) In the countryside, working, peasant, and poor women should be absorbed into the poor peasant associations, peasant associations, cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and literacy groups according to their social components. The rural women's federation should work under the unified leadership of the peasant association. The peasant association can set up a women's department (also known as the women's federation). In the peasant representative meeting and its committee, attention must be paid to absorbing women activists to participate. The method of organizing women members, whether mixed with peasants or organized separately, can be selected in consultation with local conditions and the peasant and women masses. However, no matter what form is adopted, attention should be paid to giving women members equal opportunities for training and improving their political awareness and work ability as a principle. Rural women's federations that have not yet joined the peasant association should join immediately, and the composition of the members of the women's federation should be reviewed, and landlord and rich peasant elements should be eliminated.\n\n    (4) In places where land reform has been completed, all efforts should be made to mobilize and organize the broad masses of working women to participate in the production movement. Women have made great contributions to production and supporting the front in the past. For example, in some areas, in order to supply the troops with food during combat, women milled flour and husked rice, reaching hundreds of thousands to more than one million kilograms per day. In order to solve the needs of field army clothing, the women in Southern Hebei completed the supply of 800,000 bolts of cloth one and a half months ahead of schedule. In some areas of Shandong and Taihang, this year's spring plowing was mainly completed by women. Now that the scale of the war is expanding, a large number of young and middle-aged men are constantly going to the front, so women have a glorious task in developing production and supporting the long-term self-defense war to achieve the final victory. For this reason, many systematic propaganda and organizational work are needed. In terms of production, the focus should be on organizing women to participate in agricultural labor, and according to local conditions, develop various side businesses and handicrafts, and special attention should be paid to organizing women to learn various production techniques, especially agricultural techniques. We must be good at organizing rural labor mutual aid, breaking the customs that women are ashamed to go to the fields and foot binding, which hinder women from participating in production, so as to greatly develop production and adapt to the huge needs of supporting the war. Various front-line support work also needs to be better organized for women to participate. In all kinds of work, the principle of women's consciousness and voluntariness should be taken as the principle, and the style of forced command should be corrected.\n\n    (5) During and after the completion of land reform, when mobilizing the people to carry out the democratic movement, it is necessary to mobilize women to actively participate in order to more extensively transform democratic governments, mass organizations, and various organizations and cadres of the Party, as well as the struggle against bureaucratic degenerates, so that the development of the democratic movement can reach greater depth and breadth. At the same time, in accordance with the principles of equality between men and women and democratic freedom, the various democratic rights that women deserve should be realized, and special attention should be paid to promoting activists from among the working, peasant, and poor women to participate in democratic governments, mass organizations, and various work of the Party at all levels. The leading organs of party committees and various organizations at all levels must often provide them with the most concerned help and training, train their ability to handle affairs, production skills, and improve their cultural and political level, so that in the situation where a large number of men continue to go to the front, women can replace men in various work in the rear. In mobilizing women to actively participate in the land reform, production, and democratic movements of the entire masses, conscious attention should be paid to gradually solving women's own problems (such as forced arranged marriages and some feudal bad habits that restrict women's freedom to participate in social activities), and women's movements should not be separated from the entire mass movement, that is to say, in the entire movement, the oppression and shackles left by the feudal system on women should be broken, as well as the old rules, old morals, and old ideas of women left over from the patriarchal society, so that women who are undergoing major changes can improve and improve their status in the family and in society and establish new rules, new morals, and new ideas. In carrying out these tasks, the sympathy of the peasants should be won, and long-term ideological education work should be carried out among the masses in order to completely eliminate the remnants of the feudal system.\n\n    (6) In the land reform, production movement, and front-line support work in the past two years, a large number of new women cadres have emerged. At the same time, some of the original women cadres have also gone to the countryside to participate in grassroots practical work, but it is far from meeting the needs of the development of the movement. For the greater development and needs of various movements, a large number of female cadres should be sent to work. We call on all female cadres who can go to the countryside to overcome all difficulties, go deep into the working, peasant, and poor women, insist on working and learning and exercising. Party committees at all levels should pay close attention to cultivating and promoting female comrades who can do this to participate in various leading organs, and support them in solving various difficulties, so that they can get opportunities to learn and transform. The female cadres themselves must work hard to study, transform, and improve themselves from the education of the people in the great land reform, so that they can be diligent servants who are good at serving the people, especially the most oppressed women.\n\n    At the National Land Conference, it was emphasized that the basic key to whether the above points can be thoroughly carried out lies in the fact that the Party committees at all levels must have a fully clear mass viewpoint in their leading ideology, attach importance to the strength of the women, and overcome the viewpoint of excluding women and the thought of belittling women. The leading organs should raise women's work to the task of the entire Party, and should not regard it as only the work of a few female comrades. Every party member should serve the broad masses of working women. Women's work can be done not only by female comrades, but also by male comrades. Moreover, the facts in some areas have proved that as long as male comrades overcome some ideological obstacles that they cannot do women's work, they can also do it very well.\n\n    From the materials of the National Land Conference, it can be seen that women's work in some areas has not only made new progress, but also has a clear understanding. We believe that the National Land Conference will become a historically significant turning point in the women's work of the entire Party. In the future, with the efforts of the entire Party, in the high tide of the land revolution in the entire liberated area and in the development of production and democratic movements, women's work will present a new look. The broad masses of labor, including women, will be liberated from all feudal shackles. And they will have more power and more quickly eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, thoroughly overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's rule in the entire country, and strive for the thorough victory of the New Democratic Revolution in the whole of China.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 彻底平分土地与妇女工作的新任务\n邓颖超\n1948-01-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　彻底平分土地与妇女工作的新任务\n    邓颖超\n    两年来解放区的农民在我党领导之下，进行了轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动，获得了伟大的胜利。成千万无地少地农民与广大农村劳动妇女都卷入了这个运动。他们摧毁了乡村里数千年的封建势力，他们不仅获得了土地和生产工具，而且大大地提高了阶级觉悟和政治积极性。因此，他们在经济上和政治上都翻了身。特别是劳动妇女的伟大力量，在这一运动中更明显地表现出来了。她们在土地改革运动的各种反封建斗争中，在生产战线上，在支援前线与担负后方勤务工作上，以及在农村里代替男子的各种工作岗位上，都表现了前所未有的规模与英雄的姿态。在斗争地主时，她们的诉苦，往往起了带头作用。在追索地主浮财时，她们往往在一般人易于疏忽的地方仔细入微地击破了敌人的诡计，甚至在有些地区男人在前方打蒋匪，女人在后方分田地、挖蒋根。有些地区广大的妇女成为生产的主力军；有些地区劳动妇女在乡村中已站在当权的地位；有些地区妇女在支援前线工作中，如做鞋、缝衣、磨面、碾米、短距离抬运、看护伤病员等工作上，也都作了重大的贡献。这些都说明了妇女是改革土地制度和爱国自卫战争中一个不可忽视的极重要的力量。因此，在土地改革中，发动广大劳动妇女群众来积极参加，实在是整个运动中不可缺少与极重要的组成部分。事实告诉我们：不发动农村劳动妇女群众参加土地改革，就不可能彻底完全消灭封建残余。\n    但解放区各地党对于发动与领导妇女群众参加土地改革，除个别地区有明确的认识并主动地有意识有计划地予以注意外，一般说来，还重视得不够。在大多数地区，妇女工作仍是被忽视的、自流的、没有领导的。因此，全国土地会议在总结两年来土改的经验时，着重指出：今后为了彻底平分土地、消灭封建势力，党的各级领导机关必须提高与加强妇女工作。\n    最近我党中央公布了“中国土地法大纲”，它根据农民的要求及土地改革的经验，规定了消灭封建性及半封建性剥削的土地制度，实行耕者有其田的土地制度。这一个具有伟大历史意义的土地法大纲之公布，将要在全国特别是在解放区千百万农民群众中，掀起更热烈更雄伟的土地革命运动的高潮。各地党委必须吸引广大的农村劳动妇女，积极参加这一伟大的革命运动，号召妇女群众为了自己的解放与广大农民密切团结在一起，以便组成一支强有力的队伍，去展开及贯彻土地改革运动，完成中国革命的基本任务。\n    因此，全国土地会议为了达到这个目的，根据各解放区土地改革的经验，曾着重指出当前妇女工作应特别注意下列几点：\n    （一）要以土地改革为中心，使妇女工作与土地改革结合，妇女运动与农民运动结合。两者密切结合，可以相互推动，相得益彰。农村劳动妇女与其他农民同受地主阶级的剥削和压迫，具有共同的要求，共同的利害。因此，在各地进行彻底平分土地的运动中，发动农民群众时，必须同时发动农村劳动妇女群众，不应有先男后女主从之分，更不应有捎带一下、利用一下的做法，或以落后、＠嗦、麻烦、讨厌、困难种种借口，即放弃或避开深入发动广大贫雇农妇女的工作，使妇女工作陷于自发自流的状态。\n    （二）在发动与组织农村妇女群众时，要以贫雇农妇女为骨干，团结中农妇女，贯彻群众路线于各方面。过去农村妇女工作中的阶级观点与阶级路线是长期模糊的，实际是在中农以上的地主富农妇女中兜圈子，浮在上层，包办代替，因而脱离了农村基本妇女群众。今后必须纠正这个错误，应深入贫雇农妇女群众中去，不卷的耐心地进行工作，和她们打成一片，熟悉和了解她们的痛苦与要求，衷心为她们服务。首先从老、壮年妇女入手，可采用翻心、诉苦、划阶级、追穷根、比苦、比光景、比日子等方式启发她们的阶级觉悟，使她们与地主富农分清界线。在运动中，更要特别注意培养与提拔妇女积极分子去参加各种领导工作，同时在农民与妇女群众中更广泛地宣传和解释土地法大纲，并切实贯彻这个大纲，真正作到妇女与男子一样分得土地，并有所有权。在分配浮财时，要注意男女及家庭之间的不同需要，使妇女从喜爱浮财提高到对土地的兴趣，从个人的要求出发，提高到对整个阶级利益的认识。同被压迫的全体农民团结在一起，去消灭共同的敌人——地主阶级。只有这样，在平分土地的运动中，才能使千百万妇女群众勇敢的去进行消灭封建剥削的土地制度，达到经济上、政治上的彻底解放。\n    （三）在乡村中，工农贫民妇女应按各人社会成份吸收她们加入贫农团、农会、合作社及互助组、识字组中，乡村妇女联合会应在农会统一领导下工作，农会可设妇女部（亦即妇联会），在农民代表会及其委员会中，必须注意吸收妇女的积极分子参加。妇女会员编组的方法，无论是与农民混合编组或单独编组，可依照当地情况与农民及妇女群众商量选定，但不管采用何种形式，均应注意给女会员以同等锻炼的机会，提高她们的政治觉悟和工作能力为原则。农村妇联会尚未加入农会者，应即加入，并审查妇联会的会员的成份，淘汰地主、富农分子。\n    （四）在土地改革完成的地方，应以全力发动和组织广大劳动妇女参加生产运动。妇女在生产与支前中，过去曾作了巨大的贡献。如有些地区为了供应部队作战时的给养，妇女们磨面、碾米，每天达数十万至百余万斤。为了解决野战军服装的需要，冀南的妇女于一个半月内提早完成了八十万匹布的供给。在山东、太行某些地区，今年的春耕主要是依靠妇女完成的。现在战争规模日益扩大，大批的青壮年男子不断上前线，因此，妇女在发展生产支援长期自卫战争以取得最后胜利上，负有光荣的任务。为此，需要进行许多有系统的宣传、组织工作。在生产方面，应以组织妇女参加农业劳动为主，并根据各地的条件，发展各种副业及手工业，尤应注意进行组织妇女学习各种生产技术，特别是农业技术的训练。要善于组织农村的劳动互助，打破妇女下地为耻及缠足等各种阻碍妇女参加生产的习俗，以便大量地发展生产，适应支援战争的巨大需要。各种支前工作，也需要更好的组织妇女参加。在各种工作中，都要以妇女群众的自觉和自愿为原则，纠正强迫命令的作风。\n    （五）在土地改革的过程中及完成以后，发动人民群众进行民主运动时，必须发动妇女群众积极参加，以便更广泛地进行改造民主政府、群众团体及党的各种组织与干部，以及反对官僚蜕化分子的斗争，使民主运动的发展能够达到更大的深度和广度。同时，依照男女平等及民主自由的原则，实现妇女应得的各种民主权利，并应切实注意提拔工农贫民妇女中的积极分子，参加各级民主政府、群众团体及党的各种工作。各级党委及各种组织的领导机关，要经常对她们进行最关心的帮助与培养，训练她们的办事能力、生产技术及提高她们的文化和政治水平，以便在大批男子不断走上前线的情况下，妇女能够代替男子在后方进行各种工作。应在发动妇女群众积极参加整个群众的土地改革、生产与民主运动中，有意识地注意逐渐解决妇女本身的各项问题（如强迫包办婚姻，以及限制妇女参加社会活动自由的一些封建陋习），不要使妇女运动离开了整个群众运动，即是说，在整个运动过程中，要打破封建制度残留在妇女方面的压迫与束缚，以及宗法社会遗留下来的对妇女旧规矩、旧道德、旧思想，使正在起着重大变化的妇女在家庭里、在社会上的地位能更加改进与提高，建立起新规矩、新道德、新思想。在进行这些工作时，应争取农民的同情，并应在群众中进行长期的思想教育工作，以便彻底消灭封建制度的残余。\n    （六）在两年来的土地改革、生产运动与支援前线的工作中，已经涌现出了新的大批的妇女干部，同时，原有的妇女干部中也有一部分到农村参加了下层实际工作，但还远不能适应运动发展的需要。为了各种运动更大的开展和需要，应有大批的女干部去进行工作。我们号召一切可以下乡的妇女干部应克服一切困难，深入到工农贫民妇女中去，坚持工作并学习与锻炼。各级党委对能够这样做的女同志，应切实注意培养与提拔她们参加各种领导机关，并支助她们解决各种困难，使她们能够得到学习与改造的机会。而女干部自己更要在伟大的土地改革中，从人民群众的教育中，努力学习改造自己、提高自己，使自己能够做一个善于为人民服务，特别是为最受压迫的妇女群众服务的勤务员。\n    在全国土地会议上，曾着重地指出：以上各点能否彻底进行，基本的关键就在于党的各级党委必须在领导思想上有充分明确的群众观点，重视妇女群众的力量，要克服妇女除外的观点及轻视妇女的思想。领导机关应把妇女工作提高成为全党的任务，不应把它看成只是少数女同志的工作。每个党员都要为广大劳动妇女服务，妇女工作不仅女同志能做，男同志也同样能做，而且有些地区的事实证明，男同志只要克服了不能做妇女工作的一些思想障碍后，亦能做得很好。\n    从全国土地会议上的材料可以看出，某些地区的妇女工作，不仅有了新的进步，并且有了明确的认识，我们相信全国土地会议将成为全党妇女工作的有历史意义的转折点，今后在全党努力之下，在全解放区土地革命的高潮及开展生产与民主运动中，妇女工作将要呈现一个新的面貌。包括妇女在内的广大的劳动群众，将从一切封建束缚之下解放出来。并且更有力量更迅速地消灭蒋匪军，在全国范围内彻底推翻蒋介石的统治，争取新民主主义革命在全中国的彻底胜利。"

In response to the police's unreasonable violence against the demonstrators, the working people of Florence province and its surrounding 49 towns, under the call of the trade union, announced a general strike starting on the 23rd. The Gasperi government was forced to accept the workers' demands, and the strike was declared victorious on the 24th. The city's working people held a celebration rally of tens of thousands of people. Bitossi, the secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, paid tribute to the Italian working people for their solidarity during the strike. Unemployed workers in Milan also held a large demonstration on the 22nd, forcing the reactionary government to concede and allocate 2.5 billion lire to reduce unemployment. In addition, demonstrations demanding \"a 40-hour work week to reduce unemployment\" have occurred continuously in Turin, Airona, Pisa, Livorno, Naples, and other cities. Turin recently held demonstrations against high prices. Strike events have erupted in Brescia (Sabbath Province), Sesto, Garonti, Lezgio, and Emilia. 100,000 bank employees across the country had just resumed work on the 13th, but due to the reactionary authorities' breach of contract, they announced a general strike again on the 23rd.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: According to TASS Rome dispatch of the 26th: The Italian Communist Party recently issued a special communique regarding the first meeting of the party's leading organs in Rome after the Sixth National Congress, stating: \"The Communist Party's leading organs discussed the domestic political situation, pointing out that the authorities' planned provocative actions have aroused increasing vigilance among the democratic working masses. The Gasperi government's use of violence against the legitimate demonstrations of working people and the unemployed has created a tense atmosphere, thereby delaying the election campaign.

He said: \"After we successfully opposed the splitters, we have been able to prove that only through the left-wing line can the unity of democratic forces be achieved.\" Bassou strongly stated that the Socialist and Communist parties must unite their forces to fight for a common cause. After exposing that \"the threat of fascism exists in the Christian Democratic Party's cabinet,\" he emphasized that \"there is no such thing as a third force. There are currently only two paths: either allow the reactionary policies leading to a new war to continue, or take the path of the people's democratic front towards the victory of a new democracy.\" He said: \"We must unite all those who are currently fighting for the fundamental reform of our society.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-01-30",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: A statement by the US State Department spokesman on the 5th of this month regarding Japanese reparations exposes the US conspiracy. In order to build Japan into its Eastern fortress, the US is attempting to effectively cancel reparations to preserve Japan's military industrial production capacity and shamelessly shift its responsibility to the Soviet Union. The US State Department spokesman stated that the US unilaterally ordered MacArthur in April of last year to distribute 30% of the total Japanese reparations to China (Chiang), the Philippines, Britain, and the Netherlands, which represents the current US policy on the allocation of Japanese reparations. The spokesman emphasized that, given that several US proposals for the fair distribution of Japanese reparations have been rejected, the US government believes that it will not be bound by such proposals in the future. The list of Japanese reparations factories has been reduced by MacArthur several times. On April 25 of last year, a Soviet radio commentator denounced MacArthur for removing 500 factories from the reparations list, including 24 underground aircraft factories. The provisional reparations tonnage was also reduced from 19 million tons the year before to 9 million tons in March of last year, 5.2 million tons in June, and 3.2 million tons in October. Of these so-called provisional reparations, only a small portion has been allocated to various countries; and the level of industry that Japan should maintain, according to Harrison, head of the Allied Headquarters Reparations Group on June 2 of last year: \"The previous suggestions for Japan's post-war minimum industrial level should maintain the annual output between 1930 and 1934. There are now some signs that this level may be raised.\" According to a Central News Agency dispatch on January 6, the Far Eastern Commission's economic group has decided that Japan can maintain an annual steel production of 5.5 million tons, which exceeds Japan's steel production of 5.22 million tons in 1936 before the \"July 7th Incident\" (figures from the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry). For example, in terms of ships, only 25 of the 85 shipyard factories are listed for reparations. In reality, Japan's remaining shipbuilding capacity is as high as 850,000 tons, and its repair capacity is 4.3 million tons, which exceeds the Far Eastern Commission's previous regulations of 150,000 tons for shipbuilding and 3 million tons for repair.\n    The US imperialists are arbitrarily reducing Japan's reparations and raising the level of heavy industry reserved for Japan, but the US State Department spokesman said: \"The US proposals for the distribution of Japanese reparations have never been implemented due to Soviet opposition,\" which is utterly shameless. Not only that, but according to the tone of the US State Department spokesman's remarks on the 5th, \"the US government believes that it will not be bound by such proposals in the future,\" it can be seen that the US imperialists are even preparing to overturn their previous plans regarding Japanese reparations, and more blatantly maintain the production capacity of Japan's military industry, and cooperate with their conspiracy to occupy Japan, in order to build Japan into a forward fortress for US imperialism to enslave the Eastern nations.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美阴谋奴役东方各民族　竟想取消日本赔款保持日本军事工业\n\n1948-01-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美阴谋奴役东方各民族\n  　竟想取消日本赔款保持日本军事工业\n    【新华社陕北二十七日电】华盛顿消息：本月五日美国务院发言人关于日本赔偿问题的声明，暴露了美国的阴谋。为了把日本建筑成为其东方堡垒，美国企图实际上取消赔偿，以保全日本军事工业生产能力，并无耻地将其责任加诸苏联。美国务院发言人称，美国于去年四月曾单方命令麦克阿瑟将日本赔偿品总数百分之三十，分与中（蒋）菲英荷四国，此即代表目前美国对日本赔偿品分配问题所执行之政策。该发言人着重指出：鉴于美国对于公平分配日本赔偿物资之数项建议，皆遭拒绝，因而美国政府认为自身将来也不受保持此种建议的约束。按日本赔偿工厂的名单业经麦克阿瑟数度减削，去年四月二十五日苏联广播评论员已指斥麦克阿瑟自赔偿名单中取消了五百所工厂，其中且包括二十四所地下飞机厂。临时赔偿吨数也自前年之一千九百万吨减为去年三月之九百万吨、六月之五百二十万吨、十月之三百二十万吨。此项所谓临时赔偿中，已经拨付各国的仅占甚小部分；而日本所应保持的工业水准，据去年六月二日盟军总部赔偿组长哈里逊称：“前各方建议日本之战后最低工业水准当维持一九三○——一九三四年间之每年产量。今有若干迹气表示此项水准或可予以提高”。据一月六日中央社电，远东委员会之经济小组已决议日本可保持每年五百五十万吨之钢铁生产量，此数字超过了“七、七事变”前一九三六年的日本钢产量五百二十二万吨（日本商工省数字）。例如以轮船言之，八十五家轮船厂中，列入赔偿者仅二十五家，实际上日本剩余之造船能力竟有八十五万吨，修理能力为四百三十万吨，已超过远东委员会前所规定之选船十五万吨，修理三百万吨的数字。\n    美国帝国主义者如此任意减少日本的赔偿和提高保留给日本的重工业水平，但美国国务院发言人却说：“美国关于分配日本赔偿之建议，始终未能实施，乃由于苏联反对之敌”，可谓厚颜无耻。不但如此，照美国国务院发言人五日谈话的口气，“美国政府认为自身将来也不受保持此种建议的约束”，则可见美国帝国主义者连自己以前所作的关于日本赔偿的计划，也准备推翻，而更露骨地保持日本军事工业的生产能力，并配合其占领日本的阴谋，以便在日本建立其美国帝国主义奴役东方各民族的前进堡垒。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Suslov delivered an important speech at the Moscow Commemoration of the 24th Anniversary of Lenin's Death on the 21st. He first stated: \"The development of the world situation in the past few decades has precisely followed the direction predicted by Lenin. Lenin pointed out that imperialism is the eve of socialist revolution and the final stage of capitalism. This conclusion has been confirmed by all events. Thirty years ago, our country broke free from the capitalist system. The Second World War further shook the foundations of capitalism. After the war, the American imperialists hoped to act as the world's constables and become the stranglers of freedom and independence for all countries. Under the pretext of 'anti-communism,' they are planning and implementing armed intervention in freedom-loving peoples in Greece, China, Indonesia, and other countries, and interfering in the internal affairs of other countries through blackmail, intimidation, and economic and political pressure. But the collapse of Hitler's Germany and its accomplices should serve as a historical lesson for American imperialism and its British sidekick to some extent.\" Suslov powerfully pointed out: \"If it were not for the support of the right-wing social democrats, the lackeys of imperialism in the working class, imperialism would have collapsed long ago. But despite this, the reactionary forces of imperialism are weakening day by day, while the forces of democracy and socialism are increasing day by day. The most significant proof of the ever-victorious nature of communist thought is the growth of communist parties in various countries around the world. Before the war, the French Communist Party had only 300,000 members, but now it has nearly one million. Before the war, the Italian Communist Party had only 15,000 members, but now it has 2,283,000. The Chinese Communist Party currently has 2.7 million members, compared to only 600,000 before the war (presumably referring to before the Soviet-German war - editor). The communist parties of the new democratic countries are prestigious ruling parties and have tens of millions of members. The Communist Party has gained the deep and growing trust of working people all over the world. They regard it as the faithful and consistent defender of the interests of working people, as a true fighter for lasting peace, people's democracy, and socialism. The democratic and anti-imperialist camp's increasing resistance to imperialist aggression plans is strongly supported by the Soviet Union and Stalin's foreign policy.\" When discussing the Soviet Union's foreign policy of adhering to international cooperation, Suslov pointed out: \"Stalin said that Lenin was the first person to express the idea of cooperation between the two systems.\"\n    Suslov concluded powerfully: \"The Communist Party is currently paying attention to improving the culture and communist consciousness of the working people. In our country, culture has become an extremely necessary and important part of communist construction. In order to struggle against the remnants of capitalist ideology, the Party adopts the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, directing its firepower towards the outdated and everything that hinders our progress. The decisions of the Party Central Committee on literature, art, and film, as well as the philosophical discussions presided over by the Party Central Committee, have played a significant role in exposing and struggling against all manifestations of bourgeois influence in the ideological field. In carrying out communist education for workers and eradicating capitalist remnants in the minds of the people, the Party's entire work is based on the theories of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. Marxism-Leninism is the Party's guiding star, leading us on the path to the victory of communism.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 莫斯科纪念列宁大会上苏斯洛夫演说　共产党思想百战百胜　得到世界劳动人民的深切信任\n\n1948-01-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　莫斯科纪念列宁大会上苏斯洛夫演说\n  　共产党思想百战百胜\n  　得到世界劳动人民的深切信任\n  　过去几十年世界大势的发展恰恰符合列宁所预言的方向\n  　党采取批评与自我批评的武器打击一切阻碍我们前进的东西\n    【新华社陕北二十七日电】莫斯科讯：苏斯洛夫二十一日在莫斯科纪念列宁逝世二十四周年大会上发表重要演说，首称：“过去数十年世界局势的发展，是恰恰依照列宁所预言的方向发展的。列宁指出：帝国主义是社会主义革命的前夜，是资本主义的最后阶段。这一结论已为一切事件所证实。三十年前，我国挣脱了资本主义的体系。二次世界大战进一步动摇了资本主义的基础。战后美帝国主义者指望充当世界的宪兵，成为各国自由独立的绞杀者。它们在“反共”借口下，正计划并执行着对希腊、中国、印尼等爱好自由人民的武装干涉，并以敲诈、恫吓、经济与政治压力，干涉其他国家的内政。但希特勒德国及其共谋者的垮台，对于美帝国主义及其英国小伙伴，多少应是一个具有历史性的教训”。苏氏有力指出：“如果不是帝国主义在工人阶级中的走狗社会党右翼的支持，帝国主义早就崩溃了。但尽管如此，帝国主义的反动力量正日益削弱，而民主与社会主义的力量则在日益增强。共产党思想之百战百胜的最显著的证明，便是世界各国共产党的壮大。法国战前，共产党员仅三十万人，现将近一百万人。战前意大利共产党仅有一万五千党员，现拥有二百二十八万三千人。中国共产党现有党员二百七十万人，战前仅六十万人。（恐系指苏德战争前——编者）新民主主义各国的共产党，是有威望的政府党，并拥有成千万党员。共产党获得了世界各地劳动人民深切与日益增长的信任。他们把它当作劳动人民利益的忠实与始终如一的卫护者，当作争取持久和平、人民民主与社会主义的真正的战士。民主的反帝国主义的阵营对于帝国主义侵略计划的日益增涨的抵抗，是有苏联及斯大林外交政策的有力支持的。”苏氏于谈及苏联坚持国际合作之外交政策时指出：“斯大林说列宁是首先表示两个制度合作之观念的一个人”。\n    苏氏结语力称：“共产党目前正注意提高劳动人民的文化与共产主义意识。在我国，文化已成了共产主义建设的至为必需的重要部分。为了与资本主义思想残余进行斗争，党采取批评与自我批评的武器，将火力指向陈腐的和一切阻碍我们前进的东西。党中央委员会关于文学艺术电影的决定，以及党中央所主持的哲学讨论，对于揭露思想领域上资产阶级影响的一切表现并与之作斗争，尽了重大作用。在对工人进行共产主义教育，根绝人民思想上的资本主义残余方面，党的整个工作是以马恩列斯的学说为基础的。马列主义是党的指路星，指引我们走上共产主义胜利的道路。”"

This autumn's poor harvest, after calculating household assets, revealed that the entire village will be short of food for an average of three months, shocking the cadres and the masses. Under the leadership of Wang Guo Xi's principle of \"relying on the mountain for subsistence,\" they first contributed three stones and three dou of rice and mortgaged a large hillside in Tucudui village to cut branches. This provided a foundation for winter production. The entire village has twelve full laborers, four semi-laborers, and five auxiliary laborers, totaling nineteen full labor equivalents, and four donkeys, all of which were organized. Starting from the fifteenth day of the tenth lunar month, calculating fifty days before the New Year, they will weave three hundred pairs of baskets and saddlebags, and fifty baskets. Each pair of baskets and saddlebags will be sold for 2,000 yuan, and each basket for 1,500 yuan. After deducting the hillside price, they will earn a total of 642,000 yuan. These tasks will require a total of 721 workdays, with each workday earning an average of 900 yuan. The four donkeys will transport coal to Hejian for sale fifteen times, earning 10,000 yuan each time, for a total of 150,000 yuan. Thus, the total earnings will be 792,000 yuan.

    "content": "Weekly Comprehensive War Report\n\n　　Weekly Comprehensive War Report from January 22nd to 28th:\n\n　　Northern Front: The Jinchaji Military Region, in coordination with the Northeast People's Liberation Army's winter offensive, launched a large-scale sabotage campaign against the Ping-Sui, Ping-Han, Bei-Ning, and Jin-Pu Railways around the New Year. They destroyed approximately 400 miles of railway, cutting off transportation between the key areas of the Chiang bandits in North China: Beiping, Tianjin, Baoding, and Zhangjiakou. This also dealt a serious blow to the Fu bandits, whom Chiang relied on as his Great Wall. On the 7th and 8th, the People's Liberation Army blocked the main forces of the Chiang bandits' Provisional 3rd, 16th, 35th, and 94th Armies, who were moving south to relieve Baoding, on the west side of the Ping-Bao Line, killing and wounding over 4,000 of them. On the 12th, in Zhuang and along the North and South Yi'an line east of Laishui, the PLA annihilated over 2,000 men of the New 32nd Division of the Fu bandits' 35th Army, which was attempting to relieve the siege of Laishui. Army Commander Lu Yinglin and Division Commander Li Mingding were both killed. Its 101st Division was also ambushed in Wucun, ten miles northwest of Dingxing, where over 600 were killed or captured. Additionally, the Jin 17th Division, which had rushed from the Ping-Sui Railway to reinforce, was killed or wounded by 500 men near Songlin Store. On the 13th, another group of approximately one regiment from the Provisional 11th Division of the Fu bandits' Provisional 3rd Army was completely annihilated along the Dashi Ridge to Zhunwan line, about forty miles east of Yongning, eliminating over 1,800 bandits. Thus, since the bandit leader Fu Zuoyi took office as \"Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in North China,\" his so-called \"proactive tactics,\" which he clamored for, were declared bankrupt with a loss of nearly 9,000 men, and the 35th Army, on which the Fu bandits relied for their rise, also suffered a heavy annihilating blow. Although the Chiang bandits' Central News Agency weakly boasted of a \"great victory at Laishui,\" the \"Memorial Service for Lu Yinglin and Li Mingding\" held in Zhangyuan became a stark irony of this \"victory.\"\n　　\n　　After the great victory in the sabotage campaign on the northern front, the Jinchaji Military Region launched an offensive operation towards the north of the Daqing River on the 18th, and recaptured the city of Xiongxian, northeast of Baoding, that evening. On the 19th, they continued to advance northeast and recaptured many villages and towns such as Jiugang (twenty miles northeast of Xiongxian), Kaikou (fifteen miles west of Xinzhen), Niutuo (twenty miles southwest of Yongqing), and Chaheji (ten miles west of Baxian). On the 21st, they successively recovered Baxian city. Now, the vast area north of the Daqing River, east to Anci and Shengfang, west to the east bank of the Daqing River, north to the south bank of the Yongding River, and south to Xiongxian and Xinzhen, has been liberated again.\n\n　　The Jidong Military Region continued to sabotage the Bei-Ning Railway. On the 13th, 15th, and 17th, three sections of the railway between Tangfang and Lutai were destroyed. On the 17th, our local corps severely attacked a regiment of the Chiang bandits' 92nd Army 56th Division, which attempted to reinforce the Northeast, near Shengtieying, fifteen miles east of Liushouying, annihilating and capturing over 600 men below the battalion commander. Another unit of ours stormed Ying Shouyingzi, fifty miles north of Xinglong, on the morning of the 19th, eliminating over 130 bandits.\n\n　　Southern Front: The main force of the People's Liberation Army, in coordination with the local armed forces, rounded up and suppressed Chiang bandits, captured local bullies, and recovered many towns and strongholds. On the 17th, the Yu-Shaan-E People's Liberation Army captured Xiangcheng for the third time, capturing over 30 Chiang bandits. On the night of the 18th, they also liberated Yuxian County, northwest of Xuchang, capturing 344 enemy security corps members. In mid-month, our Fourth and Fifth Military Sub-districts successively annihilated and captured over 300 men, including Lieutenant Colonel Li Shunzhen, attached to the Guidance Column of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters, in the Qinglong Mountain area bordering Henan and Hubei and in the Wangzhuang area of Linru. On the 20th, the Yu-E-Wan Jianghan Military Region attacked and captured the Tuzhang stronghold of Dongjinwan on the east bank of Xiangyang, killing and capturing 125 enemy security captains and below, threatening Xiangyang and causing the Chiang bandits there to declare martial law. In western Anhui, we swept up Chiang bandits south of Huoshan County earlier this month, killing and capturing over 250 men. On the 15th, our forces around Wuhan ambushed a part of the Chiang bandits' 28th Division on the Xiadian-Xiangbeizui (Lishan) highway. On the same day, another unit captured Bolangdian near Xiangbeizui, killing and capturing a total of 110 Chiang bandits in both battles. On the 13th, the Su-Lu-Yu-Wan People's Liberation Army recaptured Elin City, capturing over 100 local Chiang bandits alive. Fifty-six counties in the Yu-Wan-Su border area have now established democratic regimes. Under the leadership of their highest administrative organ, the Yu-Wan-Su Border Area Administrative Office, the people in the area are enthusiastically carrying out the mass movement of dividing floating wealth and land.\n\n　　On all fronts, our local armed forces, combined with the local people, braved wind, snow, and severe cold to raid and surround the enemy, recovering isolated strongholds. Part of the Shaanxi local armed forces recaptured Fugu County on the 14th, and the enemy in Yulin was completely isolated. On the 18th, they continued to capture Madigou (southwest of Hecheng), defeating two regiments of Qi Zhizhong's Fu bandit security division, annihilating and capturing over 540 enemy battalion commanders and below. The Huaibei local armed forces advanced to the east side of the Jin-Pu Railway, and on the 8th, they raided Gaoji, fifty miles northeast of Lingbi, and on the 10th, they attacked Chantang, eliminating over 170 bandit security captains and below in both battles. On the 14th, the Taihang Militia Guerrilla Detachment defeated over 1,000 bandit-puppet teams who were looting grain in the Majie Village area of Xiuwu. On the same day, they ambushed part of the Yan bandit Security 18th Regiment in the Bianzhuangtou area of Jiexiu. Another unit repelled part of the Yan puppet Eighth Column who were looting grain in Doufuzhuang, Yuci.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Xinhua News Agency)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 一周综合战报\n\n1948-01-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　一周综合战报\n    一月二十二日至二十八日一周综合战报：\n    北线方面：晋察冀我军配合东北解放军冬季攻势，于新年前后发动对平绥、平汉、北宁、津浦四条铁路的大破击战，破坏铁路全长约四百里，使华北蒋匪要地北平、天津、保定、张家口之间交通断绝，并予蒋匪倚为长城的傅匪以严重打击。解放军于七八两日沿平保线西侧阻击南下救援保定的蒋匪暂三、十六、三十五、及九十四等四个军的主力，杀伤其四千余众。十二日复在涞水城东之庄及南北义安一线，歼灭图解涞水城之围的傅匪三十五军新三十二师两千余人，军长鲁英麟、师长李铭鼎均被击毙。其一○一师亦于定兴西北十里的吴村遭我歼俘其六百余人。另由平绥路赶来增援的晋十七师亦在松林店附近被我毙伤五百余人。十三日又在永宁东约四十里之大石岭至准湾一线，全歼傅匪暂三军暂十一师一部约一个团，歼匪一千八百余名。至此，匪首傅作义就任“华北剿共总司令”以来，叫嚣的所谓“主动战术”，以损兵折将近九千人而宣告破产，而傅匪赖以起家的三十五军也遭到惨重的歼灭性的打击。蒋匪中央社虽有气无力的吹嘘“涞水大捷”，但在张垣召开之“鲁英麟、李铭鼎追悼大会”，恰恰成为此一“胜利”的鲜明的讽刺。\n    晋察冀我军于北线破击大捷后，复于十八日向大清河北展开攻势作战，当晚收复保定东北的雄县城。十九日继向东北挺进，收复咎冈（雄县东北二十里）、开口（新镇西十五里）、牛沱（永清西南二十里）、岔河集（霸县西十里）等村镇多处。二十一日相继收复霸县城。现大清河北东至安次、胜芳，西至大清河东岸，北至永定河南岸，南至雄县、新镇之间广大地区重告解放。\n    冀东我军继续破击北宁路，十三、十五、十七三日间，毁塘坊至芦台一段铁路三处。十七日我地方兵团在留守营东十五里胜铁营一带痛击企图增援东北的蒋匪九十二军五十六师的一个团，歼俘其营长以下六百余名。我另部十九日晨攻入兴隆北五十里的鹰手营子，歼匪百三十余名。\n    南线方面：解放军主力配合地方武装四出兜剿蒋匪，捕捉土顽，收复城镇据点多处。豫陕鄂解放军十七日第三次攻克襄城，俘士蒋匪三十余名。十八日夜又解放许昌西北的禹县县城，俘敌保安团三百四十四名。我四五分区本月中旬在豫鄂交界青龙山地区及临汝王庄地区，先后歼俘蒋匪杂顽西安绥署督导纵队上校支队附李舜真以下三百余名。豫鄂皖江汉军区我军二十日攻克襄阳东岸之东津湾土蒋据点，毙俘守敌保安大队长以下一百二十五人，威逼襄阳，致该地蒋匪宣布戒严。皖西方面本月上旬扫荡霍山县以南地区蒋匪，毙俘二百五十余名。武汉外围我军十五日在夏店向背咀（礼山）公路上伏击蒋匪二十八师一部，同日另部攻克向背咀附近之博郎店，两仗共毙俘蒋匪一百一十人。苏鲁豫皖我军十三日再克鄂陵城，活捉土蒋一百余名。豫皖苏边区现已有五十六个县建立了民主政权，该区人民在其最高行政机关——豫皖苏边区行政公署领导下，正热烈进行分浮财，分土地的群众翻身运动。\n    南北各线我地方武装结合当地人民冒风雪严寒，奔袭围困敌人，收复孤立据点。陕北地方武装一部十四日再度收复府谷县城，榆林之敌至此已完全孤立。十八日续克麻地沟（河曲西南），击溃傅匪保安师奇致忠部两个团，歼俘敌营长以下五百四十余名。淮北地方武装挺进津浦路东侧，八日强袭灵璧东北五十里的高集，十日攻打禅堂，两仗共歼灭匪保安大队长以下一百七十余名。太行民兵游击队十四日在修武马界村一带击溃抢粮的匪伪团队千余人，同日在介休卞庄头一带伏击阎匪保安十八团一部，另部在榆次豆腐庄击退抢粮的阎伪第八纵队一部。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（新华社）"

    "content": "Since the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, the Border Region Government has successively promulgated regulations for punishing those who sabotage land reform, and this newspaper has repeatedly pointed out that the Land Law should be seriously publicized and implemented. In some places, very good publicity and explanations have been given to the masses. The poor and hired peasants are very happy, the middle peasants are also very settled, and everyone is united in production, studying how to divide the land equally, which is very good. However, in many places, patient publicity and explanation were not carried out. In some places, there were even distortions, so that the poor and hired peasants did not truly grasp this weapon, the middle peasants showed panic, and the landlords, rich peasants, and some bad cadres secretly sabotaged... These are all unacceptable phenomena.\n\nThe basic spirit of the Land Law Outline is to eliminate feudal and semi-feudal land systems and fully satisfy the demands of the poor and hired peasants. Now that the poor and hired peasants are happy, this is very natural. Today, we should patiently and repeatedly publicize and explain to them, dispel their various concerns, and inspire them to become conscious and completely turn themselves around.\n\nThe basic spirit of the Land Law Outline is to simultaneously consolidate the unity of all middle peasants. The middle peasants will benefit from the equal distribution movement and will not suffer losses. Some middle peasants will receive land and movable property, some middle peasants will neither contribute nor receive, and only some wealthy middle peasants will take out some surplus land, which will still be done through consultation. Movable property will not be touched at all. Thoroughly eliminating feudalism, overthrowing the landlords who oppressed the middle peasants in the past, and then being able to produce with peace of mind and develop their families freely, the middle peasants should fully support the Land Law. However, some middle peasants have mistakenly believed the rumors, making them suspect that equal distribution of land is \"collectivization,\" so they are not at ease with production and instead indulge in excessive eating and drinking, wasting property. This is actually \"lifting a brick to drop it on your own foot.\" The property is your own. If you waste it today, you will regret it in the future. You should immediately stop doing such stupid things.\n\nThe Land Law Outline stipulates that landlords should also be given an equal share. It is good that some landlords are happy to hear this. However, giving him a share is after he has taken out all his property and bowed his head to the peasants. In the past, he oppressed and exploited the peasants. Today, the peasants give him a share, so that he can seek a living through labor. This is the peasants' magnanimity towards him. Therefore, the landlords should honestly wait for the equal distribution and await disposal. Some stubborn elements even want to make trouble, spread rumors, sell property... This is a crime and must be resolutely stopped. If they continue to be stubborn, the peasants will deal with them.\n\nIt is a pity that a few district and village cadres in the past occupied more fruits and made mistakes. Hearing the Land Law Outline, instead of considering how to admit their mistakes to the peasants, return the over-gained fruits, repent, and seek the understanding of the peasants, they adopted the method of continuing to make mistakes, such as not letting the peasants know the Land Law Outline, selling and concealing the over-gained fruits, indulging in excessive eating and drinking, and even scaring the peasants and provoking the unity of the peasants... They think they are very clever, but in fact they are very stupid. The peasants know everything they do. If they sell the fruits today, they will have to return them tomorrow. If they have already wasted what they have received, they will no longer be given a share in the future. They have done stupid things themselves, and they will still suffer the loss themselves. They should know that these behaviors are crimes. Knowing it and deliberately committing it, making mistakes on top of mistakes, it will be even more difficult to seek the understanding of the peasants. We once again advise these people to think more clearly. Only by knowing and correcting mistakes is the best way out!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 不要搬砖砸脚面\n\n1948-01-31\n第1版()\n专栏：短论\n\n　　不要搬砖砸脚面\n    土地法大纲公布后，边区政府接着颁布了破坏土地改革治罪条例，本报也屡次指出，应该认真宣传、执行土地法。有些地方，向群众作了很好的宣传解释，贫雇非常高兴，中农也很安心，大家团结生产，研究如何平分，这是很好的。但也有不少地方，没有进行耐心的宣传解释，有的地方还发生了曲解，以致贫雇没有真正掌握了这个武器，中农表现恐慌，地主富农和某些坏干部暗地破坏……这些都是不能允许的现象。\n    土地法大纲的基本精神是消灭封建与半封建的土地制度，充分满足贫雇农的要求。现在贫雇高兴，这是很自然的。今天应该向他们耐心反复的宣传解释，解除他们的各种顾虑，启发他们自觉起来，彻底翻过身来。\n    土地法大纲的基本精神是同时必须巩固的团结全体中农。中农在平分运动中会得到好处，不会受到损失。一部分中农要分进土地和浮财，一部分中农不出不入，只有一部分富裕中农拿出些多余的土地，还是商量着办，浮财是完全不动的。彻底消灭封建，把过去压迫中农的地主打倒，以后可以安心生产，放手发家，中农应该完全拥护土地法。但是有些中农误信了谣言，使他们怀疑平分土地是“归伙”，于是不安心生产，反而大吃二喝，浪费财产，这其实是“拿起砖头砸自己的脚”。财产是你自己的，今天浪费了，将来会后悔，应该立刻停止干这种傻事。\n    土地法大纲规定分给地主同样一份。有些地主听了高兴，这也是好的。但是，给他一份是在他把全部财产都拿出来，并且向农民低了头以后。过去他压迫剥削农民，今天农民给他一份，使他从劳动中求生活，这是农民对他的宽大。所以地主应该老老实实等待平分，听候处理。竟有些执迷不悟的东西，听说平分，想闹一闹，制造谣言，变卖财产……这是犯了罪，要坚决制止。再执迷不悟，农民会对付他们的。\n    可惜的是有少数区村干部过去多占了果实，犯了错误，听到土地法大纲，不是考虑如何向农民承认错误，退出多得果实，痛改前非，求得农民的谅解。而是采取了继续犯错误的方法，如不让农民知道土地法大纲，变卖与隐蔽多得果实，大吃二喝，甚至吓唬农民，挑拨农民的团结……他自己以为很聪明，其实是很傻的。他的事情农民都知道。今天变卖了果实，明天还得退出来。已经拿到的浪费了，将来不再分给他。自己办了糊涂事，吃亏的还是自己。要知道这些行为是犯罪的，明知故犯，错上加错，就更难求得农民的谅解了。我们再一次劝告这些人，还是想明白些。只有知过就改，才是最好的出路！"

    "content": "Criticism and Suggestions\n\n\tForcing the Masses to Invest is Wrong\n\n\tThe shares of the Yangjiaxigou Cooperative in the Ninth District of Lin County were mostly obtained from the fruits of struggle. Later, the cooperative adopted a decentralized approach, becoming seven or eight small cooperatives. As a result, there were many workers, and no rice to eat. The village cadres forced the masses to invest one dou of rice per household, and also held a mass meeting, saying, \"The cooperative serves the masses, so everyone must invest. No one is allowed to leave until they sign up.\" The masses had no choice but to sign. Forty-five poor and hired peasant households, and seventy-five middle peasant households, accumulated a total of seven shi and eight dou of rice, and those without rice contributed five thousand five hundred yuan. Some poor and hired peasants couldn't afford it, and it's still recorded in the books. The rice was valued at 174,000 yuan at market price.\n\n\tThe village cadres also held a women's meeting. Village Chief Yang Zhonghua said, \"Our village is establishing a dyeing workshop, so you can dye cloth cheaply in the future.\" The masses were silent. The village chief said, \"Everyone must invest, it won't work if you don't.\" No one spoke. The village chief said, \"You don't know what's good for you. Whoever doesn't invest, lock the door and stand guard. No one is allowed to leave until they sign up.\" The women had no choice but to sign, accumulating a total of 110,600 yuan before the meeting was dismissed. (Zhen Nan, Qing Xin)\n\n\tIt was already wrong to start a cooperative with the fruits of struggle. It's even more wrong to have mismanaged it and squandered the capital. To forcibly compel poor and hired peasants and middle peasants to invest, locking the door and standing guard, not allowing anyone to leave until they invest, is simply extortion. Forcible orders and oppression of the masses are utterly outrageous. We hope that the leaders of Lin County's county and district levels will immediately conduct a serious inspection and handle this matter, and write to us about the handling situation.\n\t\t——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 不该强迫群众入股\n振南　清新\n1948-01-31\n第1版()\n专栏：批评与建议\n\n　　不该强迫群众入股\n    林县九区杨家西沟合作社的股金，大部是斗争果实。以后合作社采取了分散方法，成了七、八个小型合作社。结果工人多，吃的没有了米。村干部强迫群众一户入一斗米，还召开了群众会，说：“合作社为群众服务，都得入股，谁不写不准走。”群众没法子，只好写。贫雇农四十五户，中农七十五户，共积了七石八斗米，没米的凑了五千五百元。有些贫雇出不起，现还在帐上记着。把米按市价作了十七万四千元。\n    村干部还召开了妇女会，村长杨忠花说：“咱村成立染房，你们以后染布便宜。”群众不作声。村长说：“都得入，不入不行。”没人说话。村长说：“不知好歹，谁不入股，把门关住，站上岗。谁不写，不能走。”妇女没有办法，只得写吧，共积了十一万零六百元才散会。（振南、清新）\n    用斗争果实开合作社，本来就不对。因为办理不好，把本钱吃光了，更不对。还要强迫贫雇和中农入股，关住门站上岗，不入股不能走，这简直是勒索。强迫命令，压迫群众，可算胡闹极了。希望林县县、区领导上立刻认真的检查处理，并把处理情形写给我们。　　　　　　——编者"

Liberated soldier Feng Ziqing of the eighth company of a certain battalion wrote in his application to join the Party: \"My performance in combat is ordinary.\" Before this battle, he was determined to \"not be ordinary.\" After the battle began, he single-handedly rushed into the enemy's house and threw several grenades, and twenty-two enemies surrendered their guns to him. He handed the prisoners over to the platoon leader and immediately jumped over the courtyard wall and rushed into another room. At this time, the enemy's bayonet was already in front of him. He deflected the bayonet and, in a moment of wit, shouted: \"Comrades outside! Rush in! Those who surrender their weapons will be treated with leniency, those who don't will be killed!\" Twelve enemies trembled with fear and handed over their guns together. Then, during the general attack, he disarmed thirty Chiang Kai-shek soldiers in a large courtyard. Li Qingyuan, deputy squad leader of the second squad of the ninth company of a certain battalion, who had been commended twice for his merits, was liberated from Chiang Kai-shek's 195th Division last year. In this Wenjiatai battle, the squad leader was wounded, and he immediately commanded the entire squad to continue fighting. They rushed into a small house and wiped out the enemies. However, the enemies surrounded them from the outside. Li Qingyuan did not panic. He placed four soldiers in four corners of the room, and he guarded the window. The enemy's machine gun ten meters away was aimed directly at them. He first shot down the enemy's machine gunner. At this time, the enemy's mountain artillery shells hit, and the sulfur smoke made them dizzy. The enemies rushed up. Li Qingyuan said to the soldiers: \"If we hold this house and seize the mountain artillery, we can achieve meritorious deeds.\" He immediately threw a package of explosives, killing eight enemies. The Chiang bandits then set fire to the house, and they finally broke through the encirclement. Hou Shaojun, a soldier of the seventh squad of the third company of a certain unit, was liberated from Chiang Kai-shek's Qing 2nd Division. In this battle, the squad was an assault team, and the assault point was a gap blasted open. As soon as the entire squad rushed to the wall, the enemy sealed the gap with four light and heavy machine guns. The soldiers were all wounded before the assault. Hou Shaojun untied the grenades from the wounded soldiers and threw them at the enemy, throwing more than thirty in succession. His arm was sore, and the grenades were exhausted. He picked up his rifle and continued to fight until the follow-up troops rushed up and finally wiped out the enemies.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 公主屯被解放战士英勇作战杀敌立功\n\n1948-01-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　公主屯被解放战士英勇作战杀敌立功\n    【新华社东北二十九日电】沈北公主屯战役中，解放军某部的许多解放战士，因经过启发教育，有了阶级觉悟，都能英勇作战，杀敌立功。某营八连解放战士冯子青，他在入党志愿书上写着：“战斗中表现平常”，这次战斗前，他下定了决心，一定要“不平常”。战斗开始后，他就单人独枪冲进敌人的屋子去扔了几颗手榴弹，二十二个敌人向他缴了枪。他把俘虏缴给排长，马上又跳过院墙，冲进另一间屋子，这时敌人的刺刀已经到了他的眼前，他拨开刺刀，急中生智地喊：“外面的同志们！冲进来！缴枪的优待，不缴枪的打死”。十二个敌人胆颤心惊，一齐交出枪来。接着在总攻击时，他又在一个大院子里解除了三十个蒋匪军的武装。记过两次功的某营九连二班副班长李庆元，是去年从蒋军一九五师解放过来的，这次文家台战斗，班长负了伤，他即指挥全班，继续作战，他们冲进一个小屋子，把敌人消灭了之后，敌人却在外面把他们包围起来，李庆元毫不慌张，将四个战士布置在四个屋角，他守住窗口，十米达外的敌人机枪正对准扫射，他首先射倒了敌人的机枪射手。这时，敌人山炮弹打过来，硫磺烟将他们熏得头昏脑胀，敌人冲上来了，李庆元向战士说：“我们守住这座房子，夺来山炮，就能立功”，立即把一包炸药投出去，炸死了八个敌人，蒋匪又放火烧房子，他们最后终于突出包围。某部三连七班战士侯少钧，是从蒋军青二师解放过来的，这次战斗中，该班是突击队，突击点是轰炸开的缺口，全班刚突到围墙跟前，敌人以四挺轻重机枪把缺口封锁住，战士们在突击前都负了伤，侯少钧把负伤战士的手榴弹解下来，向敌人打去，先后投了三十多个，胳膊酸了，手榴弹也打光了，他拿起步枪继续战斗，直到后续部队冲上来，终于把敌人消灭。"

In Xingnong and Taiping and other four districts of Hailong County alone, more than 9,000 emancipated farmers signed up in five days in late December last year. After strict review, 4,450 people were selected and gloriously enlisted. Those who were not selected automatically organized reserve teams, preparing to participate in the next round. Following the previous 3,200 soldiers, more than 5,500 emancipated farmers from Dongfeng County poured into the main force on New Year's Day. Since the county held its first Emancipated People's Representative Congress in late December last year, and reorganized the county government, a conscription movement immediately swept through all 24 districts of the county. The masses conducted background and ideological checks on the recruits, checking not only within their own village but also in neighboring villages. In Xin Jin County, Andong Province, after the poor and hired peasant congresses were held in various districts, more than 3,700 young people and adults joined the army in half a month. The upsurge of poor and hired peasants joining the army in Xiu Yan County also caused a sensation throughout the county. Among the more than 7,000 people who joined the army, there were 253 model parents and virtuous wives who sent their sons and husbands to the battlefield. More than 5,000 emancipated farmers in the new and old areas of eastern Rehe joined the People's Liberation Army. In Erdaowanzi District of Jianchang East, the new recruits were formed into three large detachments according to class, platoon, and company before enlisting, staying in place for several days. After the initial land distribution in Yebaishou, everyone also asked to establish their own corps.

At that time, a person gathering manure pointed them to the car road. Our cart followed the ox carts onto it (which was, of course, our fault). But the manure collector went back to the village and reported it, and militiamen came and caught them, fining each cart 50,000 yuan. It turned out that the manure collector was the one watching the road. I feel that this isn't road maintenance, but using the road to get rich.

    "content": "[This dispatch] Opposing sabotage and sweeping away misunderstandings: The Land Law should be conscientiously publicized.\n\n[This newspaper reports] The Land Law Outline aims to eliminate the feudal class and thoroughly redistribute land. In many places in Taihang, landlords have already been discovered plotting resistance; bad village cadres who have gained too much are secretly sabotaging; and some middle peasants and newly turned peasants temporarily believe landlord rumors, showing suspicion and panic. These sabotage activities of landlords and bad cadres should be stopped immediately, and the suspicions of middle peasants and turned peasants should be well explained and dispelled.\n\nDu Xiyang, a landlord in Lijia’nao, Zuoquan, was previously said to be an \"enlightened landlord.\" When he heard the Land Law Outline, his true colors were immediately revealed. At night, he said to his son, Du Erhai: \"Sell the donkey, you son of a bitch, sell it for money, hold it in your hand, so they, the sons of bitches, can't divide it.\" Hao Jinyang, a rich peasant in Qiaogou, eats thin porridge on the street during the day, and steamed buns and oily cakes at home at night. Wei Xihe, a landlord in Nangou, eats sesame candy with his whole family at night. When eating, they close the door and tell their son to stand guard on the roof. Yang Xiaowu and Gao Yujin, landlords in Jiuyao, immediately spread rumors to middle peasants after hearing the Land Law Outline, saying: \"This time it's your middle peasants' turn!\"\n\nThe village chief of Shiyujun, Zuoquan, returned from a \"Land Redistribution Conference\" in the district on the 20th. He didn't publicize anything to the masses, but secretly sold five dan of grain himself. The masses are all quietly saying: \"He came back without saying a word and sold grain. What's going on!\" Not only did he sell it himself, but he also persuaded those who were against him to sell twenty dan. The village chief of Houyujiao didn't publicize the Land Law to the masses, but secretly sold three dan of corn. The village chief of Banshang secretly sold a donkey. The chairman of the Hanwang Farmers' Association immediately slaughtered six pigs from the vermicelli mill. After hearing about the Land Law, the chairman of the Shijie Village Farmers' Association in Linxian, who had gained too many fruits, privately sold a cow and a set of timber. The public security officer of Dongzhuang, Xiyang, quickly confiscated the property of two landlord households and one middle peasant household after seeing the Land Law. His reason was that the landlords were wasteful and the middle peasants had political problems. In fact, this middle peasant was his brother, and they had some grudges when they divided the family property, so he was taking the opportunity to retaliate. In addition, quite a few village cadres and a few district cadres do not read the Land Law Outline to the masses, saying that they are \"afraid of affecting the production enthusiasm of the masses.\" There is also a more serious phenomenon, which is estimated to be an attempt by some people to provoke clan struggles between villages and split the unity of the peasants. Hongni and Tiihou villages in the sixth district of Pingshun are competing for a hillside, which is about two hundred mu in size, and is covered with small cypress trees, estimated to have a total of more than six thousand nine hundred trees. The largest of them is two chi in diameter. The two villages had had several quarrels over this forest before, but to no avail. The cadres of Hongni Village saw that the Land Law Outline stipulated that mountain forests should also be divided, and were afraid that the cypress slope would be divided to Tiihou Village. So, taking advantage of the absence of district cadres in the village for a meeting, they \"mobilized\" the masses in the folk school, asking the masses to chop them down at a low price of four yuan per jin (the general price of firewood is still fifteen yuan). On the 11th, some people chopped down trees for a day and chopped back more than twenty trees, preparing to continue chopping them down the next day. It happened that Comrade Zhang Xiaoxian of the county federation passed by and stopped it after asking. But the village cadres were still justified in saying, \"This was agreed to by the masses.\"\n\nChen Bucai, a middle peasant in Rencun, Linxian, had already delivered manure to the field. When he heard about the equal distribution of land, he moved the manure to the edge of the field. He said, \"If I am divided this half of the land, I will transport the manure to that half of the land. If I am divided that half, I will transport the manure to this side.\" Wang Fuyun, a turned peasant in Dongguan, Xiyang, said, \"I agree with the equal distribution. But now I don't dare to deliver manure. I don't know which piece I can get!\" Two middle peasant households in Beihengshan slaughtered two ewes after hearing about the equal distribution of land.

They have been denouncing the crimes of the Chiang bandits at meetings to recount their suffering. In one unit, over 300 liberated fighters from the Reorganized 3rd Division, more than half of them poured out their grievances and expressed their determination to take revenge in the campaign to recount sufferings and seek revenge. A man named Liu Deshan from Shaanxi province recounted that his family used to be able to make a living, but later most of their property was taken away by the Ba長 [head of a sub-district]. Once, the house of a security captain named Gong was robbed, and Liu Deshan's family was falsely accused of the robbery. The whole family was arrested, and later they borrowed money from all sides to redeem the whole family. His father soon died from illness and anger. His older brother was conscripted into the army, and he and his mother fled to Ankang. As soon as they arrived, he was drafted by the Ba長. After he escaped, he was chased by the Ba長 until he had nowhere to go, so he jumped into the river and was carried several miles by the water before he was rescued. Later, he secretly returned, but was mistakenly labeled a bandit by the Ba長 Wu Yingzhang, who hung him up and beat him all night before selling him as a conscript. His mother was so angry that she went blind. He was押 [escorted] to the 94th Division, his body covered with sores, and he was as thin as a dead man, but he still had to dig fortifications, digging until the skin on his hands broke and bled, and he was even beaten by the company commander with a wooden stick. The Chiang bandits often stripped seriously ill people naked, tied three or five of them together, and buried them alive. He and other sick people were also carried to the field. Many sick people screamed, \"Don't bury me! I can still live!\" But they were still pushed into the pit one by one. Later, because the Chiang bandits had not finished burying them, the troops assembled, and Liu Deshan was left with his life. Speaking of this, he seemed even more resentful. He said, \"As long as I live, I will never forget this blood feud!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 整三师被俘士兵　参加我军报蒋仇\n\n1948-01-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　整三师被俘士兵\n  　参加我军报蒋仇\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线廿九日电】在西平获得解放的整三师士兵大部参加了解放军，他们纷纷在诉苦会上控诉蒋匪罪恶。某部三百余整三师解放战士，在诉苦复仇运动中，一半以上的人尽情的倒出了苦水，表示了复仇的决心。一个叫刘德山的陕西人控诉说，他家里原来还可以过活，后来家产大部被保长要走了。有一次一个姓弓的保安队长家被抢了，硬诬是刘德山家抢的。把一家人都捉了去，后来东借西卖凑钱把全家赎出来，父亲连病带气很快就死了。哥哥被抓去当兵，他和母亲逃到安康，刚到就被保长派了壮丁。他逃跑后，被保长追得走头无路，便跳了河被河水冲了几里路才被救起。以后他偷偷回去，但又被保长吴营章误批为匪，吊打一夜后，卖了壮丁，他娘因此气得瞎了眼。他被押到九十四师，浑身长了疮，瘦得象死人，可是还得挖工事，挖得两手皮破，鲜血淋漓，还被连长用木棍打。蒋匪对重病号常是剥光衣服，三五个捆在一起活埋。他也和其他病号被抬到野外，许多病号都惨叫着：“不要埋我呀！我还能活呀！”但仍被一个个推进坑里。后来因为蒋匪还没有埋完，队伍就集合了，刘德山留得了一条活命。他说到这里，更加显得愤恨，他说：“我活着一天，就永忘不了这血海深仇”！"

The biggest feature of these articles is that the content is practical, reflecting the local work and the demands of the masses, and the language is lively and mass-oriented. Peasant correspondents pay great attention to the authenticity and political significance of their articles, and are absolutely responsible to their newspapers. Before writing, they discuss it first; after writing, they read it aloud to everyone and have it reviewed by the group, and then send it to the district committee for review (important manuscripts are sent to the county committee for review). After the newspaper publishes it, they read the newspaper again to see if the editor's revisions are correct and why such revisions are needed, in order to learn writing.

In order to ensure the smooth completion of the military training plan, put the slogan of \"supporting the government and cherishing the people\" into practical action, cultivate soldiers' labor concepts, and improve their own food, they took three days out of the intense military training to carry coal from a place more than a hundred miles away from their station. Prior to this, thorough mobilization was carried out in each battalion and company through large and small meetings, and the entire regiment was swept up in a coal-carrying upsurge. A total of 1,182 people participated for three days, carrying back more than 50,000 catties of coal, saving more than 2.8 million yuan according to the market price at the time, and saving more than 1,600 civilian labor days. In this coal-carrying effort, many heroic models emerged. Comrade Zhao Fugui of the Fourth Battalion carried 80 catties himself and explained to other comrades, \"Aren't we, the People's Liberation Army, still carrying things the same way when we are civilians at home? Besides, this is also to improve our lives, so we have to do a good job.\" Comrade Bai Shouchun of the Fifth Company of the Second Battalion has always been active in his work, and this time he was even more energetic in carrying coal, carrying 54 catties. Every time they arrived at a station, they took the initiative to find houses, cook meals, and borrow things. After returning first, he went to pick up others. The Third Squad Leader of the Second Platoon of the First Battalion carried coal at the front, singing songs and shouting slogans to encourage everyone's morale during breaks. Battalion Commander Zhang Xiaotian of the Second Battalion was sick himself, but he personally went to pick up the soldiers and carried for them. The soldiers reflected, \"The advantage of the People's Liberation Army is here, the leaders work the same way as us, truly sharing blessings and working together.\" Squad Leader Qin Longshan of the Recuperation Company has always been a good comrade. This time, he carried 75 catties and promptly boosted everyone's morale, successfully completing the task.

    "date": "1948-01-31",

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, 27th – In response to the incident of Zhao Jizhou, Commander of the Third Sub-district of Bohai, using armed force to suppress the peasant land reform movement and shooting peasant leaders, the East China Military Region has issued a special order to dismiss him from his post and investigate him. The order stated: Zhao Jizhou, as a sub-district commander, actually deserted his post, deceived his subordinates, stood on the side of the landlords, supported the feudal forces of his sister-in-law and brother-in-law, and shot Cao Meishu, the village party secretary (farmers' association chairman), and beat and bound up to twelve village cadres and members of the masses. This is completely a criminal act that violates the traditional spirit of revolutionary soldiers and is absolutely intolerable to our army. The People's Liberation Army represents the interests of 90% of the peasant masses in the countryside, implements land reform, and liberates the broad masses of peasants. The entire army, from top to bottom, should resolutely struggle for this goal. Zhao Jizhou failed to set an example by upholding the just demands of the peasants, but instead stood on the side of the landlord class, resulting in counter-revolutionary crimes. Therefore, he is hereby dismissed from his post and investigated to enforce discipline and warn against similar actions.\n\nThe Bohai District Party Committee, adhering to the orders of the East China Military Region and accepting the opinions of the masses, has also officially decided: 1. To remove Zhao Jizhou from his position as sub-district commander and immediately detain him. 2. To remove him from his position as a member of the District Committee and expel him from the Party. 3. To hand him over to Shenjiaying in Wei (County) North for the masses to handle.\n\nZhao Jizhou's counter-revolutionary facts are as follows: In early July of last year, when the situation in the central section of the Jiaoji Railway was tense, Zhao Jizhou was leading his troops in the Shouguang Second District defense area awaiting orders to attack. At that time, his brother-in-law – Shen Pingzhi, a major feudal tyrant from Shenjiaying in Wei (County) North – went to the army to find Zhao, telling him about the situation of his family and the family of Zhao's other sister-in-law – a traitorous and tyrannical figure in the same village – being liquidated and struggled against by the masses, and asked Zhao for help. After hearing this, Zhao immediately abandoned his military duties, deserted his post, and secretly led eleven cavalrymen to Shenjiaying overnight. Before entering the village, he deceived his subordinates by saying, \"Tonight, we are going to capture special agents and underground lines,\" and drew up a list, specifically naming people to be arrested. He arrested a total of twelve people, including the village cadre, the head of the women's federation, the militia instructor, and staff members, and subjected them to all kinds of torture and insults. Cao Meishu, the village party secretary and farmers' association chairman (who also served as the director of the land reform committee of eight villages), a hired farmhand, was brutally beaten and shot to death by Zhao's cavalry, sacrificing heroically. After Cao's death, Zhao Jizhou also said, \"Killing three or two is nothing,\" and finally forcibly escorted the village cadres and masses away from the village.\n\nAfter Zhao Jizhou was dismissed from his post and investigated, the Bohai Daily published an editorial entitled \"On Zhao Jizhou's Crimes and Our Attitude,\" first expressing a hundredfold concern for the family of the victimized peasant leader Comrade Cao Meishu and the masses of the village, and pointing out that Zhao Jizhou's actions of torturing the masses and village cadres, shooting the branch secretary, and suppressing the land reform movement were acts of treason against the Party and the people. He used the identity of a Communist Party member and commander, and the peasants' guns to suppress the peasants' struggle for liberation. This is an extremely vicious and heartbreaking thing. He is a traitor to the Party and the peasants. It further pointed out that we, the Communist Party members and revolutionary soldiers, should adopt a serious attitude towards Zhao Jizhou's crimes and should recognize that this is a question of revolution and counter-revolution. The discipline of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army is strict, and any action that violates the interests of the people cannot be tolerated, no matter how senior you are, how high your position is, or how great your \"achievements\" are. The editorial concluded: This incident tells us that only those who can resolutely sever ties with landlord families and feudal relatives can stand with the peasants; those who want to serve the landlord bullies and feudal forces and remain unrepentant will surely be spurned by the peasant masses and cause major crimes.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 武装镇压农民翻身犯了大罪　渤海三分区司令员　赵寄舟被开除党籍　撤职查办交给群众处理\n\n1948-01-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　武装镇压农民翻身犯了大罪\n  　渤海三分区司令员\n  　赵寄舟被开除党籍\n  　撤职查办交给群众处理\n    【新华社华东二十七日电】华东军区为渤海三分区司令员赵寄舟，武装镇压农民土地改革运动，枪杀农民领袖事件，顷特通令将其撤职查办。通令提出：赵寄舟身为分区司令员，竟擅离阵地，欺骗部属，站在地主立场，替其姐丈妹夫封建势力撑腰，枪杀村支书（农会长）曹美枢，并捆打村干部群众达十二名，这完全是违反革命军人传统精神的犯罪行为，为我军所绝对不能容许的。解放军代表占农村百分之九十的农民群众的利益，实行土地改革，使广大农民得以解放，全军上下都应为此目标而坚决奋斗。赵寄舟不以身作则，坚持农民的正义要求，反而站在地主阶级立场，造成反革命罪行，为此特将其撤职查办，以申纪律而警效尤。\n    渤海区党委秉承华东军区命令，及接受群众意见，亦正式决定：一、撤销赵寄舟之分区司令员职务，立即将其扣押。二、撤销其地委委员职务，并开除党籍。三、押交维（县）北沈家营，交群众处理。\n    赵寄舟反革命事实如下：去年七月初旬，胶济路中段形势紧张时，赵寄舟正带领部队在寿光二区防地待令出击。当时其妹夫——维（县）北沈家营大封建恶霸沈平之曾至军中找赵，告诉他家和赵的另一姐丈家——同村之奸特恶霸——被群众清算斗争情形，要赵救援。赵听后马上放下军事任务不管，擅离职守，私带骑兵十一名，连夜赶到沈家营。进庄前以“今晚去捉特务地下线”欺骗部下，开列名单指名捉人，捉到该村村干妇救会长、民兵指导员及工作人员共十二人，给以百般拷打辱骂。该村支部书记兼农会长（并兼八个村翻身委员会主任）雇农曹美枢被赵之骑兵痛殴并被枪杀，惨烈牺牲。曹死后，赵寄舟还说：“打死三个两个算不了什么”，最后并将该村干部群众强押离村。\n    赵寄舟被撤职查办后，渤海日报特以“论赵寄舟的犯罪和我们的态度”为题发表社论，首先对被害农民领袖曹美枢同志家属和该村群众寄以百倍关切，并指出：赵寄舟拷打群众村干、枪杀支书、镇压土地改革运动的行为是直接叛变党和人民的犯罪犯法行为。他以共产党员、司令员的身份，以农民的枪杆子镇压农民的翻身斗争，这是极端恶毒而又非常痛心的事，他是党与农民的叛徒。继指出：对于赵寄舟的犯罪，我们共产党人与革命军人应当采取严肃的态度，应认识这是革命与反革命的问题。共产党与人民解放军的纪律是严肃的，任何违犯人民利益的行动都不能容许，哪怕你资格再老、地位再高、“功绩”再大，都不能例外。社论最后说：这个事件告诉我们，谁能够坚决和地主家庭封建亲属斩断联系，谁才能够和农民站在一起；谁要为地主恶霸封建势力服务而又执迷不悟，那他就一定为农民群众所唾弃，而造成重大的罪恶。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 29th: New York dispatch: The American people have launched a large-scale just movement against the US government's aid to Chiang Kai-shek for aggression against China and against the US's entire policy of aggression and expansion in the Far East. The National Conference on American Policy toward China and the Far East, initiated by the American Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy for this purpose, was held in New York from the 23rd to the 25th. Attendees included representatives from 107 American organizations, including 30 trade unions affiliated with the CIO and AFL, representatives from several independent unions and many other organizations, as well as PM publisher Field, Dr. Wen Youzhang (a Canadian), former professor at West China University, renowned journalist Ms. Strong, and Far East expert Ge Si, among others. Former US Congressman DeLacy served as the organizer of the conference. One of the chairmen of the conference was Bi Sheng, a well-known American expert on Far Eastern affairs and former special advisor to MacArthur. Mr. Brisson, Chairman of the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union, elaborated in his opening speech that the purpose of the union was to plan actions to stop the US government's assistance to Chiang Kai-shek and the reactionary forces in the Netherlands, France, and Korea, and to formulate progressive Asian policies to counter the US government's policy of aggression and expansion in the Far East. Brisson emphasized: \"Our (referring to the American people) response to the war crisis must be embargoes, sending delegations to Congress to petition, and other more active measures.\" In his speech, DeLacy advocated that dockworkers and ship workers organize pickets to prevent ships carrying military supplies from sailing to China. At a mass meeting before the conference, Ms. Strong, based on her personal observations in China, severely condemned the US government for aiding Chiang Kai-shek in slaughtering the Chinese people with airplanes and artillery.\n\n　　The meeting passed a resolution demanding that the United States adopt democratic policies towards China, Indonesia, Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, and India, and formulated an action program to stop the transportation of weapons, munitions, and other aid to Chiang Kai-shek and the Dutch and French aggressors in Indonesia and Vietnam. It also demanded that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea, allowing the Korean people to decide their form of government without foreign interference, to purge former pro-Japanese elements and traitors from the South Korean (US-controlled area) government, police, and other public institutions, and to immediately dissolve all terrorist organizations.\n\n　　During the conference, congratulatory telegrams were received from various democratic and progressive organizations and individuals in the United States. Representatives of the Philippine People's Liberation Army and representatives of the Chinese Liberated Areas attending the Prague World Federation of Trade Unions also sent telegrams of congratulations. The US Communist Party organ, the Daily Worker, warmly praised the conference, and pointed out that the American reactionaries are planning to interfere in China in new and more intense ways, and the conference must formulate a progressive Asian policy to deal with the current challenges from the American reactionaries.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美国一百多个人民团体代表开大会　掀起大规模反援蒋运动　以行动阻止美帝对远东的侵略政策\n\n1948-01-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美国一百多个人民团体代表开大会\n  　掀起大规模反援蒋运动\n  　以行动阻止美帝对远东的侵略政策\n    【新华社陕北二十九日电】纽约讯：美国人民已掀起大规模的反对美政府援蒋侵华及反对美国整个远东侵略扩张政策的正义运动。美国远东民主政策委员会为此目的所发起的美国对华及远东政策全国会议，已于二十三至二十五日在纽约召开。与会者包括美国一百零七个团体的代表，其中包括三十个产联与劳联所属的职工会，若干独立工会和其他许多组织的代表，及下午报发行人费尔德、前中国华西大学教授文幼章博士（加拿大人）、名记者史特朗女士，远东问题专家葛思等人。前美众院议员德拉西担任大会组织工作。大会主席之一为美国著名远东问题专家曾任麦克阿瑟特别顾问之毕生。美国海运厨工膳务工人工会主席布利逊，在开幕演说中，阐述该会目的在计划以行动阻止美政府对蒋介石及荷兰、法国、朝鲜反动的援助，并制定进步的亚洲政策，以对抗美政府在远东的侵略扩张政策。布利逊强调指出：“我们（指美国人民）对战争危机的答复，必须是禁运，及派代表团到国会请愿，以及其他更多的行动方式。”德拉西演说中主张由码头、船舶工人组织纠察队，阻止载运军火物资的船只开往中国。史特朗在会议前的群众大会上，根据他在华的亲身见闻，严厉谴责美政府以飞机大炮援助蒋介石屠杀中国人民。\n    会议通过决议，要求美国对中国、印尼、朝鲜、菲律宾、越南及印度采取民主政策，并拟订行动纲领，以停止运输武器、军火及其他援助给蒋介石和印尼、越南的荷、法侵略者。并要求一切外国驻军撤离朝鲜，让朝鲜人民不受外力干涉，自行决定其政府形式，清洗南韩（美统治区）政府警察及其他公共机关中的前亲日分子与卖国贼，并立即解散一切恐怖组织。\n    该会开会期间，接到美国国内各民主进步团体与个人之贺电，菲律宾人民解放军代表及出席布拉格世界职工联盟会议的中国解放区代表亦驰电致贺。美共机关报工人日报予该会以热烈赞扬，并指出美国反动派正在计划以新的更激烈的方式干涉中国，大会必须制定一个进步的亚洲政策，以便对付目前美国反动派的挑战。"

    "content": "The Valiant People of Eastern Chahar Fight Courageously\n\n　　Soon after the People's Liberation Army withdrew from the Ping-Sui Railway line last year, the bandit Fu [Fu Zuoyi] occupied Zhao Chuan Fort, Longguan, Chicheng, and Diaobao with 50,000 troops, pressing towards Chongli, Yanqing, and Yongning, and opened up the highways from Zhao Chuan to Longguan, Chicheng to Diaobao, Yanjia Ping to Yanqing, and Huailai, dividing eastern Chahar into several small pieces in all directions. However, the people of eastern Chahar did not retreat because of the harsh environment. On the contrary, they fought the enemy more heroically. In the freezing weather, cadres of the democratic government, in coordination with local military groups, used fire to melt the frozen earth, buried landmines, and bombed the enemy, constantly shooting at them. A militiaman in Longguan, in order to monitor the enemy on the mountain, had his feet frozen to his shoes. When he took them off, his skin and flesh came off with them.\n\n　　Under the heroic resistance of the people, the bandit Fu, in order to protect the Ping-Sui Railway and control eastern Chahar, used two divisions to repeatedly \"mop up\" and \"suppress\" areas such as Longguan, Chicheng, Huailai, and Yanqing. Last winter, when the enemy \"mopped up\" the old base areas of eastern Chahar, such as Jining Fort, Damiaozi, Shitou Fort, and Yantong Temple villages, they burned every house they saw in every small ditch and village, smashed every pot, and burned down even the houses that the Japanese invaders had not destroyed during the War of Resistance. The people fought heroically with the enemy. The people of Jining Fort and other places refused to go down the mountain for three days without food. Zhao Shun, a famous model of supporting the army in northern Hebei, led the militia of Yingzhuangzi to fight the enemy three times in ten days, which ultimately prevented the enemy from entering the village. Cadres of the democratic government and the people sometimes ate cold food in the snow and sometimes marched through the snowy mountains all night during the anti-\"mopping up\" campaign, without wavering. Comrade Wang, a cadre in the seventh district of Huailai, who insisted on working in Babao Mountain, was caught by enemy agents, taken to the security office, hung on a tree, and had his muscles cut with a knife, causing him to bleed profusely, but he did not say a word and finally died heroically. After the heroic and arduous struggle of the people, all the enemy's \"mopping up\" operations finally failed. The Chicheng militia independently fought 287 battles in half a year, killing and capturing 517 Chiang-Fu bandits, and removing more than a dozen large and small strongholds such as Muling, besieging the enemy in several isolated strongholds. Since last autumn, in order to make a final struggle, the Chiang-Fu bandits created inhumane \"no-man's-lands\" in Chongli and other border areas, driving all peaceful residents, men, women, old and young, from the villages into \"human circles,\" scattering pigs, dogs, cattle, and sheep, and leaving the courtyards in the villages overgrown with weeds. The people who were driven into the \"human circles\" were without clothes or food, suffering from hunger and cold. Men were captured to serve as soldiers, and women were brutally raped. However, after the heroic struggle of the people of eastern Chahar, under the cover of the main forces, the masses, supporting the old and carrying the young, escaped from the \"human circles,\" and the \"no-man's-lands\" have been revitalized, creating an isolated siege of the enemy's strongholds, forcing the enemy on the Diaobao to Huaiqing highway to retreat, besieging strongholds such as Longguan and Zhao Chuan Fort, and returning large areas of eastern Chahar to the hands of the people. Recently, local armed forces have been constantly launching active and extensive attacks on the enemy. The Huailai local armed forces set fire to the city gate of Huailai; the Chongli local armed forces annihilated more than 120 enemies in one battle; the democratic government of the Yanqing area has approached the city gate, and even our staff are frequently active in areas more than ten miles outside Zhangjiakou. Under the siege of the people's army, the bandit Fu is terrified.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 英勇斗争的察东人民\n\n1948-01-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　英勇斗争的察东人民\n    当前年解放军退出平绥线不久，傅匪即以五万大军占领了赵川堡、龙关、赤城、雕堡，进迫崇礼、延庆、永宁，并打通赵川至龙关；赤城至雕堡、阎家坪至延庆、怀来各公路，把察东分成东西南北若干小块。但是察东人民并没有因为环境残酷而退缩，相反的他们更英勇的和敌人进行搏斗。在冰天雪地里，民主政府的干部协同地方兵团曾用火将冻了的土地化开，埋下地雷，爆炸敌人。不断射击敌人。龙关的一个民兵为了在山上监视敌人，把脚都冻的贴在鞋上，回来一脱，皮肉都掉下来。\n    在人民英勇抗击下，傅匪为了保护平绥路，控制察东，曾用两个师兵力，反复“扫荡”、“清剿”龙关、赤城、怀来、延庆等地区。前年冬天敌人“扫荡”察东老根据地纪宁堡、大庙子、石头堡、烟筒寺等村时，每一小沟，小村见房便烧，有锅便打，将抗战中日寇未曾烧毁的房屋也烧得精光，人民英勇的和敌人搏斗，纪宁堡等地人民，三天不吃东西也不下山。有名的平北拥军模范，六十多岁的老人赵顺，曾率领英庄子民兵与敌人在十天中战斗三次，终使敌人未敢进庄。民主政府的干部和人民在反“扫荡”时，有时在雪地里吃冷饭，有时彻夜在雪山中行进，毫不动摇。坚持八宝山工作的怀来七区干部王同志，被敌特抓住，带到保安，吊在树上，用刀割身上肌肉、鲜血直流，但他只字不吐，最后仍然英勇就义。经过人民英勇的艰苦奋斗，敌人的一切“扫荡”终于失败。赤城民兵在半年中曾独立作战二百八十七次，毙俘蒋傅匪军五百一十七名，拔除墓岭等大小据点十余处，将敌人围困在几个孤立据点内。去年入秋以来，蒋傅匪为了最后挣扎，曾在崇礼等边沿区制造惨无人道的“无人区”，将男女老幼所有和平居民从村中赶入“人圈”、猪、狗、牛、羊四散，村中庭院野草丛生。而被赶到“人圈”的人民，则无衣无食，饥寒交迫，男子被抓去当兵，妇女惨遭奸污。但经过察东人民英勇奋斗，在大部队的掩护下，群众扶老携幼从“人圈”逃回，“无人区”已重新恢复活跃气象，反过来造成对敌据点的孤立围困，逼退了雕堡到怀庆公路上的敌人，围困了龙关、赵川堡等据点，使察东广大地区重入人民之手。最近各地方武装不断主动广泛出击敌人。怀来地武曾火烧怀来城门；崇礼地武一次即歼敌百二十余；延庆地区民主政府工作已逼近城关，甚至张家口十里以外地区经常也有我们工作人员活动。在人民大军群起围攻下，傅匪胆战心惊。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 28th: Comprehensive news from newspapers in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas reveals that farmers are suffering from layers of exploitation and oppression under the Chiang bandits' malignant inflation and harsh monopoly system. Farmers must pay high prices when purchasing agricultural supplies and consumer goods, while agricultural products and export raw materials are devalued under the monopoly rule of the four big families, resulting in a very serious state of unequal exchange between agricultural and industrial products. Taking Shanghai as an example: before the Lunar New Year, the price index of raw materials and food was more than 77,000 times that of the pre-war period, with plant foods being more than 71,000 times; while industrial manufactured goods were more than 161,000 times that of the pre-war period. The latter's increase exceeds the former by more than one time. This unequal state is even more profound in the rural areas of the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas. Taking the rural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang at the end of 1946 as an example: the price of white rice was 7,500 times higher than before the war, wheat was 8,400 times higher, and soybeans were 6,800 times higher; while at the same time, twelve pounds of fine cloth was 21,300 times higher than before the war, 20-count cotton yarn was 12,300 times higher, matches were 11,000 times higher, and soap was 11,000 times higher. The China Farmers Bank, affiliated with the CC clique leader Chen Lifu, recently published the ratio of agricultural product prices to farmers' industrial necessities in Sichuan, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai and other provinces since 1944, and had to admit this disparity. The Dagong Bao, affiliated with the Political Science clique, also said: The price of agricultural products lags far behind agricultural supplies and consumer goods, causing serious damage to farmers; and in malignant inflation, landlords increase rents and deposits, raising their land rent rates; usurers raise interest rates, and miscellaneous taxes also increase. The newspaper was also forced to admit that the Chiang bandit gang's various ruling classes have transferred the burden of inflation to the farmers.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋区粮食涨价赶不上日用品涨价　农民受蒋匪层层剥削\n\n1948-01-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋区粮食涨价赶不上日用品涨价\n  　农民受蒋匪层层剥削\n    【新华社陕北二十八日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：蒋区农民在蒋匪恶性通货膨胀，及严酷垄断制度下，受到一层又一层的剥削和压榨。农民在购买农用品及消费品时，须付出高价，而农产品及出口原料品，在四大家族垄断统治下，价格又被贬低，以致农产品与工业品处在极严重的不等价交换状态中。以上海为例：年前十一月原料品与食品价格指数为战前的七万七千余倍，其中植物食品为七万一千余倍；而工业制造品则为战前的十六万一千余倍。后者之上涨超过前者一倍以上。在蒋区农村中这种不等价状态更为深刻，以一九四六年底的江浙农村为例。白粳米价较战前高七千五百倍，小麦高八千四百倍，黄豆高六千八百倍；而同时期的十二磅细布却较战前高二万一千三百倍，二十支棉纱高一万二千三百倍，火柴高一万一千倍，肥皂高一万一千倍。ＣＣ匪首陈立夫系的中国农民银行最近发表的自一九四四年以来四川、甘肃、宁夏、青海等省农产品价格与农民工业必需品的指数比例，亦不得不承认此种悬殊情形。政学系的大公报也说：农产品价格远落在农用品和消费品之后，使农民受到严重损害；且在恶性通货膨胀中，地主加租加押，提高其地租率；高利贷者提高利息率，苛捐杂税也加多加重。该报也被迫承认，将匪帮各统治阶层内部已把通货膨胀的重负转价到农民身上。"

They are eagerly hoping for the early implementation of the Land Law.

This time, you have to divide some good land to me fairly!\" Tian Fa, a new middle peasant in Beixingtou, said: \"On the surface, we are new middle peasants, but in reality, we are empty-handed. We lack everything.\" Li Micheng, who has been a long-term farmhand in Laoya Village, Cixian County, for more than thirty years, said: \"In the past, we were like cattle and horses for the landlords, and today we are still used like livestock. The landlord's livestock are tethered, but we still have to grind and plow by hand.\" They urgently demand a thorough and fair distribution to achieve complete liberation. At a meeting of poor and hired peasants in Laoya Village, veteran farmhand Wang Baoxing said: \"We have been liberated for several years, but we haven't truly risen. We are still cultivating land that requires a hoe (cannot be plowed), while the landlord Wang Yue still cultivates flat, fertile land. Our one mu of land is divided into several small plots, while his one plot is sixteen mu.\" Li Baishan's mother and Wang Mida both said: \"We support taking the landlords' livestock, land, and possessions and dividing them equally. We firmly support it!\" When the peasants in Xin Street and Hexia Street in Licheng City studied the Land Law Outline, they were particularly fond of the first four articles that said \"abolish\" and \"abolish.\" Poor peasant Li Jinde said: \"In our street, twenty households, eighteen used to suffer under two landlords. What are we waiting for to abolish them?\" When they read the abolition of all land ownership of ancestral halls, temples, government agencies, and schools, someone interjected: \"This is exactly right. During the struggle last winter, the land occupied by various government agencies and schools was all the best land, while what we got was very bad. Now, we should be able to cultivate good land!\" Qiao Zhizhang, a poor peasant in Qiankou Village, Xiyang County, said: \"Things are still not equal now, and there should be an equal distribution. Those who cultivate good land still have good land, and those who cultivate bad land still have bad land. I carry a load of grass to the market to eat cornbread, while others ride洋车 [foreign car, bicycle] and eat meat noodles.\" In Hanzhuang Village, Huguan County, the quantity and quality of land allocated were unfair. The poor and hired peasants were most satisfied with \"drawing from the surplus to make up for the deficiency\" and \"drawing from the fertile to make up for the barren.\" Poor peasant Gui Lin said: \"Equal distribution is our law. I have long wanted equal distribution, but in the past, liberation only benefited those who were eloquent!\" Some said: \"We can't get rich from distant land, and we have no land nearby. How can we be motivated to produce? Now, we want to distribute distant and near land, good and bad land fairly, then it will be truly just!\" During the widespread discussions and deliberations, many poor peasants reflected on many problems. Ren Xinnian, a poor peasant in Xin Street, Licheng County, said: \"In the past, only the cadres discussed, and whatever they decided was the way it was. From now on, we should be in charge of our own affairs.\" The peasants realized that the Land Law was a good law to help them achieve liberation and were extremely motivated. After discussing the issue of \"equal distribution must involve resolute struggle and prevent various forms of sabotage,\" the poor and hired peasants in Shuzhang Village unanimously proposed the slogan: \"We must achieve thorough liberation, the landlords must be completely overthrown, and the land must be completely distributed equally!\" Cheng Yuquan, a poor peasant in Chengjiashan Village, Licheng County, said: \"This time, we should be the backbone of the equal distribution. If we unite with the middle peasants, we can overthrow the landlords and distribute the land equally.\" In Shexian and Huguan, some landlords spread rumors, saying, \"The equal distribution will not differentiate between classes.\" The peasants rose up to refute this, saying, \"That is our business. You landlords have no right to interfere.\" Some middle peasants (especially wealthy middle peasants) were initially uneasy when they heard about equal distribution, but after learning that \"the wealthy middle peasants will not have their movable property touched, and the surplus land will be extracted through consultation,\" they gradually stabilized. Guan Shuan, an old middle peasant in Beixingtou, Huguan County, said: \"All winter, I heard that there would be a three-check movement, and I was very afraid. I am very happy to hear this. Employing poor peasants not only does not separate us, but unites us. This is great!\" On this basis, the middle and poor peasants of the village united, paying attention to the landlords' sabotage activities and preparing to implement the Land Law.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “这回可得给我分些好的哩！”　贫雇要求实现土地法\n\n1948-01-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“这回可得给我分些好的哩！”\n  　贫雇要求实现土地法\n    【太行消息】综合报导：从最近磁县、内邱、左权、黎城等八、九个县的来稿看，土地法大纲得到广大农民（特别是未翻透身的贫雇农）的热烈拥护，他们迫切希望着土地法的早日实现。许多贫雇在听别人念土地法和自己讨论土地法时，自自然然的诉起苦来，诉说他们穷困的情形。壶关树掌村德昌家，没吃没喝受了一辈子罪。今年过冬还是没衣服穿、没被子盖。全村四十多个贫雇都是种着山坡圪条条地，有七户贫雇，今天还典种着人家十三亩地。任成老婆受了一辈子罪，腰都累弯了。以前话都不敢说，听了土地法大纲，可说起来了：“我就种着一亩地，这回可得给我平分上些好的哩！”北行头的新中农田法则说：“咱表面看是新中农，实际是个空空洞洞，要啥没啥。”磁县老鸦峪住了三十多年长工的李米成说：“咱过去是给地主当牛马，今天还是当牲口用。地主牲口在拴着，咱推碾、犁地还都是人来干。”他们迫切要求来个彻底平分翻透身。老鸦峪村贫雇会上，老雇工王保兴说：“咱翻了好几年身，也没翻起来，眼下还是种着镢头地（不能用犁耕），地主王岳还是种着案板地（平坦的整块）。咱一亩地是好几块，人家一块地就有十六亩。”李白山娘和王米成都说：“把地主的牲口、土地、东西都拿来平分，咱可是拥护，坚决拥护！”黎城城内新街和河下街的农民研究土地法大纲时，对前四条“废除”“废除”特别爱听。贫雇李金德说：“咱街二十户，以前有十八户是给两家地主受，这不废除他等啥？”接着读到废除一切祠堂、庙宇、机关、学校的土地所有权时，有人插嘴说：“这一下可弄对啦。年时冬天斗争，各机关学校占的也都是拔脑儿地（好地），轮到咱的就很坏了。现在咱可该种种好地啦！”昔阳前口庄贫雇乔之章说：“现在还是不平等，应该平分。种好地的还是好地，种坏地的还是坏地，咱担一担草到集上吃糠饼子。人家骑洋车，还吃肉面。”壶关韩庄村，土地分配的数量、质量都不公平，贫雇听了土地法，最满意的是“抽多补少”“抽肥补瘦”。贫雇贵林的说：“平分就是咱的法令，我早就有意平分，以前翻身都翻给伢能说会道的人啦！”有的说：“远地不发家，近地咱没啦，咱生产怎能有劲？现在要远配近、好配坏平分，那可就真公道啦！”大家在普遍的酝酿讨论中，好多贫雇农反映出很多问题。黎城新街贫农任新年说：“过去是光干部讨论，人家捏成个啥就是个啥，以后咱的事要由咱来作主才对。”农民们认识到土地法是帮助自己翻身的好法令，劲头极高。树掌村的贫雇在讨论了“平分必须坚决斗争，防止各种破坏”的问题后，大家便一致提出：“咱们要彻底翻身，地主要彻底打倒，土地要彻底平分”的口号。黎城程家山的贫农程雨宽说：“这次平分以咱为骨干，团结中农就可以把地主打倒，把土地平分好。”在涉县和壶关有的地主散布谣言，说“要平分可不分阶级了。”农民就起来驳斥说：“那是我们的事，你地主没权来过问。”有些中农（特别是富裕中农）初听到平分时，曾有些不安，但在了解到“富裕中农不动浮财，长余的地也是商量着抽出些”后，慢慢就稳定了。壶关北行头旧中农管拴则说：“一冬天我听说要来个三查运动，心中很怕，这一说我可高兴啦。雇贫农不但不和咱分家，还来个团结哩，这可好！”就在这样的基础上，该村中贫农便团结了起来，注意地主的破坏活动，准备着实行土地法。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 28th: The \"Gun Poetry\" movement in a certain unit of the Central China People's Liberation Army has become a new weapon in the unit's political work. After Central China began its counter-offensive in August of last year, the morale of the People's Liberation Army soared. Liu Gansheng, the political instructor of the artillery company of a certain detachment of the unit, and the company commander, imitated the Soviet army's practice of writing \"Fight to Berlin\" on artillery shells and tanks when they attacked Berlin. Based on the various technical advantages and disadvantages of the guns and cannons, and the requirements for them, they wrote short poems and posted them on the guns and cannons. For example, on a certain gunner's flat-shooting gun was posted: \"Flat-shooting gun is very loud, hits well on Nanyang Bank (place name near Ye Ting City), everyone in the regiment and brigade knows it, this time can't be a white hit (meaning to lose face)\", and another soldier's Type 82 mortar had this on it: \"Type 82 cannon, your age is really not young, but your prestige is not very high, this time against the war, has been praised and welcomed by the military in various places. They have also written their own plans for meritorious service into poems and posted them on their weapons and calling it \"Gun Poetry\". This creation was promoted and popularized by the leadership and quickly became a widespread mass movement. The commander's flag wrote: \"My flag is bright red, less casualties in combat command,\" and a certain company's heavy machine gun wrote: \"Maxim heavy machine gun is like a dragon, it charges when fighting, if it can fight well again this time, it will make great contributions at the commendation meeting.\" Cook Feng Anquan's rice-washing basket read: \"The rice-washing basket is not too big, not too small, it's full of rice, no more no less, it's scrubbed three or four times in the water, and the sand and mud are washed away. Comrades all say it is very hygienic, and everyone eats very full. Fight in the counter-offensive and capture more guns. If we win the battle, I will also have credit.\"\n    After the movement was launched, the unit made significant improvements in military, political, and cultural aspects. After the Type 82 mortar was posted with a poem saying \"Don't fall behind,\" all the soldiers in the squad worked day and night to study it carefully and finally came up with various ways to improve its effectiveness. Shen Honghai, a soldier in a certain battalion's machine gun company, posted on his rifle: \"My 79 gun, polished brightly, this time I'm going to counter-attack, desperately fight old Chiang,\" and after that, he wiped his gun and practiced martial arts every day. In a certain battle, as soon as the attack order was issued, he jumped out of the position and shouted, \"My 79 is shining brightly,\" and rushed towards the enemy with a burst of energy. When marching was tiring, everyone read the \"Gun Poetry\" of \"Learn literature and martial arts and not be afraid of hardship,\" and immediately stepped up their pace. In the southern line offensive, the masses along the way warmly welcomed and helped, and the soldiers wrote poems to express their gratitude and determination. Yu Yuankun wrote: \"Received the respect of the people, determined to eliminate the enemy, go to the battlefield in battle, serve the country, the Party, and the people.\"\n    Based on existing experience, this \"Gun Poetry\" has three major benefits: First, everyone can write, and those who can't write can ask others to write for them. It can be read anytime, anywhere, absorbing the participation of the majority of commanders and fighters, breaking the narrow circle of propaganda and mobilization work limited to a few cadres and activists in the past. Moreover, the slogans of propaganda and mobilization are written according to the requirements of each person and in their own language, so they are very specific and effective. Second, the plan for meritorious service is poeticized, which is easy for the soldiers to remember, and it is very flexible. New poems can be written at any time according to new tasks, thus powerfully promoting various tasks. Third, it improves the cultural level of the soldiers. After the soldiers have compiled their own \"Gun Poetry,\" they are very interested in reading it, looking at it, and writing it. In this way, they have memorized many new words.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 部队政治工作新武器　华中创“枪杆诗”运动\n\n1948-01-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　部队政治工作新武器\n  　华中创“枪杆诗”运动\n    【新华社华东前线二十八日电】华中解放军某部的“枪杆诗”运动，已成为该部政治工作中的新式武器。去年八月华中开始转入反攻后，解放军士气高涨，该部某支队炮兵连指导员刘干声和连长，仿效苏军进攻柏林时，炮弹坦克上都写上“打到柏林去”的作法，根据各种枪炮技术上的优缺点和对它的要求，写成短诗歌贴在枪炮上。如某炮手的平射炮上贴着：“平射炮刮刮叫，南洋岸（地名在叶挺城附近）打得好，团里旅里都知道，这次不能打白掉（丢脸的意思）”，又如某战士的八二迫击炮上贴着：“八二炮，你的年龄真不小，可是你威信不很高，这次反战义，得到了各地军的赞杨和欢迎，他们纷纷把自己的立功计划也写成诗歌，贴在各人的武器上，并叫它为：“枪杆诗”。此一创造经领导上提倡推广，就迅速成为普遍的群众运动，指挥员旗子上写着：“我的旗子红通通，战斗指挥少伤亡”，某连重机枪上写着：“马克沁重机如条龙，打起仗来它冲锋，这次再能打得好，表功会上立大功”。炊事员封安全的淘米箩上写着：“淘米箩不大不小，装上米不多不少，在水里三擦四捣，把沙子泥粒淘掉。同志们都说卫生很好，大家都吃得挺饱，反攻打仗多把枪缴，打了胜仗我也有功劳。”\n    运动开展后，该部在军事、政治、文化各方面均有显著提高。八二迫击炮被贴上“不要落后了”一诗后，全班战士日夜精心研究，终于想出种种办法，提高了它的效力。某营机炮连战士沈洪海在步枪上贴上：“我的七九枪，擦得亮堂堂，这次去反攻，拼命打老蒋”，以后他就天天擦枪练武，某次战斗中，出击令刚下，他就跃出阵地大喊：“我的七九亮堂堂”一股劲杀向敌人。行军疲劳时，大家念起“学文学武不怕吃苦”的“枪杆诗”，脚底下立刻就加了劲。南线攻势中，沿途群众热烈欢迎帮助，战士们纷纷作诗感谢表明决心，余元坤写的是：“受了人民尊敬，决心消灭敌人，作战上了战场，报国报党报人民”。\n    根据已有经验，这种“枪杆诗”有三大好处：一、人人可以写，不会写的叫人代写，随时随地可以念，吸收了广大指战员参加，打破了过去宣传鼓动工作只限于少数干部和积极分子的狭小圈子。而且宣传鼓动口号是根据各人的要求，用各人自己的语言写成，因此非常具体有效。二、把立功计划诗歌化，战士们容易记住，而且非常灵活，随时按照新任务写新诗歌，因而有力的推动了各项工作。三、提高了战士的文化水平，战士们编好了自己的“枪杆诗”，就很有兴趣的去念它看它写它，这样把许多生字都记熟了。"

    "content": "Prevent Landlords from Disguising Themselves\n　　Gaoyi Uncovers Hidden Landlords from Other Counties\n　　[Gaoyi News] In Xiguan of this county, there is a household from Fangdeng Village, Lincheng County, named Zhang Shenyan. Before the incident, his family owned more than 90 mu of land, making him the second-largest landlord in the village. After the incident, Fangdeng Village became a guerrilla zone. The Anti-Japanese government led the people in implementing rent and interest reduction. To avoid being liquidated by the masses, Zhang Shenyan sold more than 40 mu of land and moved his entire family to Xiguan Village in this county in 1942, where they earned a living by grinding flour. Later, they opened a grain shop. After liberation in 1944, in order to conceal his landlord identity, he pretended to be proactive and posed as a poor peasant, and during mass movements, he was allocated houses, land, livestock, and other fruits of the struggle, worth more than 720,000 yuan. Zhang Shenyan even wormed his way into the Gaoyi Public Security Bureau as a production worker. Later, someone in the government discovered that he was a feudal landlord and asked the Xiguan cadres to request a certificate of residency and class status from Fangdeng Village. Zhang Shenyan found an unscrupulous element in Fangdeng Village who stole the village government's official seal and wrote a certificate stating that he was a bankrupt middle peasant and that there was nothing wrong with him being allocated the fruits of the struggle. For a time, they were misled by him. Later, the government wrote to the village chief of Fangdeng Village again to inquire, and the masses in Fangdeng Village realized that he had escaped here and demanded that he be returned for liquidation. The village chief of Fangdeng Village came in person to demand that he return the fruits of the struggle to the masses in Xiguan. However, after inspecting his property, it was only worth (according to the then-current market price) more than 240,000 yuan. In these few years, Zhang Shenyan wasted and stole more than 470,000 yuan of the masses' fruits. We hope that the masses in all regions will be vigilant and prevent feudal landlords from disguising themselves, playing all sorts of tricks, and deceiving and exploiting us.\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Gaoyi County United Cooperative Communications Group)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 防止地主改头换面　高邑查出外县隐蔽地主\n\n1948-01-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　防止地主改头换面\n  　高邑查出外县隐蔽地主\n    【高邑消息】本县西关有个临城县方等村的住户，叫张慎言，事变前他家有地九十余亩，是村中第二个地主。事变后方等村成了游击区。抗日政府领导人民实行减租减息，张慎言为了躲避群众清算，就卖了四十余亩地，在一九四二年全家逃到本县西关村磨面为生，后来又开了粮店。一九四四年解放后，他为了掩蔽自己的地主面目，假装积极，冒充贫雇，在群众运动时分了房屋土地及牲口等斗争果实，共值七十二万余元。张慎言又钻到高邑公安局当生产员。后来政府有人发现他是一个封建地主，便叫西关干部向他要方等村的迁居成份证明信。张慎言找了一个方等村的不良分子，偷盖村公所公章，写了一个证明信，说他是个破落中农，分果实没有什么。一时被他迷糊住了。后来政府又与方等村长去信，再次追问，方等群众才知道他逃到这里，要求将他要回清算。方等村长亲自来要，叫他把分的果实退给西关群众。但将他的财物检查后，只值（按当时市价）二十四万余元，在这几年中，张慎言浪费窃取群众果实四十七万余元。望各地群众提高警惕，防止封建地主改头换面，耍百般花样，欺骗剥削咱们。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（高邑县联社通讯组）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 26th—Of the 400,000 disaster victims in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region who have suffered the most from the Chiang Kai-shek-caused disaster, 100,000 are on the verge of starvation, and another 100,000 are surviving on bran and other substitutes. Chairman Lin of the Border Region Government is leading governments at all levels to carry out disaster relief with the greatest effort, putting forward the slogan of fighting \"to not let a single person starve to death.\" Chairman Lin pointed out with indignation that the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region has suffered inhumane destruction by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, resulting in a serious disaster. A large number of young men were taken away and killed by the enemy. The area of cultivated land has been reduced by 20% to 30%. Over 500,000 mu of seedlings have been trampled, over 150,000 jin of cotton have been lost, over 140,000 trees have been lost, over 170,000 pigs and sheep have been lost, over 65,000 head of cattle, donkeys, and horses have been lost, 230,000 pieces of farm implements have been destroyed, and over 47,000 spinning machines have been destroyed. Chairman Lin emphasized that disaster relief is the most urgent task at present. Disaster relief should be the priority in areas with particularly severe disasters. Disaster relief should be combined with land reform, and the grain confiscated from landlords and requisitioned from rich peasants should be quickly distributed to local disaster victims as their due fruits of struggle. We have already carried out emergency adjustments in some areas. We have allocated 500 shi of public grain from Zhidan County to relieve Zizhou, Hengshan, Zhenchuan, and other counties, and are transporting 5,000 shi of public grain from the Longdong sub-region to distribute to Zizhou, Jingbian, Hengshan, Zichang, Anse, and other counties. Grain is also continuing to be transported from Jin-Sui and other areas, some of which has been given to Sui, Mi, Jia, and other counties. Chairman Lin called on all counties, districts, and villages to make adjustments at any time. Party members and cadres' families with grain reserves should enthusiastically donate or lend them to disaster victims, and buy large quantities of grain from grain-producing areas and transport it to grain-deficient areas for sale at fair prices. Fifty thousand jin of cotton should be quickly distributed to women in disaster areas. Chairman Lin also pointed out that due to suffering from cold and hunger caused by the Chiang disaster, epidemics have occurred in some areas of Jia County and around Panlong Yongping. The government has sent medical teams to provide treatment. In addition, all regions should plan immigration according to specific conditions, organize production and transportation, practice strict economy, and cherish people's labor and resources. Only by forming disaster relief work into a mass movement can we overcome difficulties. Chairman Lin believes that the fraternal assistance of large quantities of grain, cotton, and cloth from other liberated areas has also become an important force for us to overcome the famine, and expresses deep gratitude to the great collectivist spirit of the people of Jin-Sui and other liberated areas for providing massive material assistance. Finally, Chairman Lin sternly reminded that in some disaster areas, Party and government workers at all levels have not seriously solved the hunger and cold problems of disaster victims, and in some non-disaster areas, they have not regarded this as an urgent task to be carried out. This attitude of turning a blind eye to the people's suffering is not worthy of being a good public servant of the people. The Northwest Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China also simultaneously issued a decision on disaster relief in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, specifically stipulating various emergency disaster relief measures.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陕甘宁急救蒋造灾荒　陇东等地拨粮五千石\n\n1948-01-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　陕甘宁急救蒋造灾荒\n  　陇东等地拨粮五千石\n    【新华社西北二十六日电】陕甘宁边区遭受蒋灾最重的四十万灾民中，目前已有十万人接近断炊，另有十万人以糠秕等代食品渡日。边府林主席正领导各级政府以最大力量进行救灾。提出为“不让饿死一个人”而斗争的口号。林主席痛愤指出边区遭受蒋胡匪帮惨无人性的破坏，造成严重灾情，大批壮丁被敌人拉走和杀害，耕地面积缩小了百分之二十至三十，青苗被践踏五十余万亩、棉花损失十五万余斤、树木损失十四万余株、猪羊损失十七万余只、牛驴马六万五千余头、农具被毁坏二十三万件、纺织机被毁四万七千余架。林主席强调指出救灾是目前紧急要务，灾情特别严重地区应以救灾第一，要把救灾与土改结合，把没收地主及征收富农长余粮食迅速分给当地灾民作为其应得的斗争果实。我们已在若干地区进行紧急调剂，曾从志丹县拨出五百石公粮救济子洲、横山、镇川等县，并正从陇东分区运出五千石公粮分配给子洲、靖边、横山、子长、安塞等县，晋绥等地亦继续运来粮食，其中一部分已给绥、米、葭等县。林主席号召各县区乡村之间，随时进行调剂，党员干部家庭有存粮，应首先踊跃捐助或借给灾民，并从产粮区大量买粮运至缺粮区实行平粜，五万斤棉花应迅速发给灾民妇女。林主席并提出由于遭受蒋灾挨冻受饿，在葭县部分地区及蟠龙永坪一带已发生流行疫病，政府已派医辽队前往救治。此外，各区按具体情况有计划的移民，组织生产运输，厉行节约，爱惜民力物力。只有把救灾工作形成群众性运动，我们就一定能够渡过困难。林主席认为其他兄弟解放区给予巨量粮食、棉花、布匹的友爱援助，也成为我们战胜灾荒的重要力量，对晋绥及其他解放区人民伟大集体主义精神，以巨量物质援助，表示深切感谢。最后林主席严厉提醒，在部分灾区，各级党政工作人员还没有认真去解决灾民的饿冻问题，而在有些非灾区也没有把这看作一项紧急任务去执行，这种对于人民灾难熟视无睹的态度，不配当人民的好长工。中共西北中央局亦同时发布关于陕甘宁边区救灾问题的决定，具体规定各项紧急救灾措施。"
