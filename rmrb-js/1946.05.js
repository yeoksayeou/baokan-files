    "content": "Appealing for Seven Million People\n    Li Zhuang\n            I. Destruction and Rebirth\n    On April 9th, five jeeps carrying the Yellow River Survey Team departed from Heze, heading northeast along the old course of the Yellow River. The jeeps flew small flags with the words \"Yellow River\" written on them.\n    \"The Yellow River is coming back!\" The people of Puyang County dreamed of the overwhelming Yellow River waters returning. Fear gripped millions of residents along the river.\n    This year, the Kuomintang proposed \"Returning the Yellow River to its Old Course.\" Because the Liberated Areas considered this a major issue concerning the lives of millions, they immediately sent their representatives to negotiate with the Kuomintang. After the Kaifeng meeting, representatives from the three parties formed a joint survey team to investigate the old course of the Yellow River, to determine the construction plan for the closing and the relief measures.\n    The jeeps drove by, carrying mysterious news. People saw the Kuomintang representatives in their suits and ties, and they were even more astonished. They knew that these were the people who had been in charge of \"governing the Yellow River\" in the past, embezzling funds and causing the Yellow River to breach its banks frequently. Their arrival would only bring more misfortune. However, they also saw their own representatives—Cao Xinzhai, Director of the Jilu Yu Administrative Office, and Sun Mingfu, among others—and they felt relieved. They petitioned, they pleaded, hoping that the representatives would see this crucial issue concerning the lives of seven million people in nearly thirty counties, to first restore the dikes and dredge the river, then close the breach and release the water, and at the same time provide effective relief to the affected people. They knew that the Kuomintang representatives could not be trusted, so they demanded that their own representatives must be included in the river management organization.\n    A week of surveying gave the impression of destruction and rebirth.\n    The two thousand li of river dikes were completely fragmented. In many places, they had been dug into blockade ditches by the enemy and puppet troops, and in many places, they had been converted into farmland by farmers. Coupled with wind and rain, many sections of the dikes had disappeared without a trace. Zhao Shouyu, Chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, also said: \"Thirty percent of the dikes need to be completely rebuilt.\"\n    Without actually seeing the old course of the Yellow River, it is difficult to imagine how terrible it is. Due to the destruction of the dikes, many sections of the riverbed are one zhang two to two zhang higher than the ground. These so-called \"suspended rivers\" are all the result of past rulers only treating the symptoms and not the root causes, focusing solely on \"building high walls.\" Most of the protective stone dams have collapsed, and on the sandy riverbed stand frightening silt滩 after silt滩.... Such a large project cannot be completed in a short period. Within the Jilu Yu Liberated Area, the river stretches for a total of 1,426 li. If it is completely repaired, at least 35 million cubic meters of earthwork will be needed, requiring 23.3 million man-days—a terrifying number!\n    However, a trip along the old course of the Yellow River can also show the greatness of the democratic government and the strength of the masses. Since this area became a Liberated Area, people who had fled due to past floods have returned. Under the leadership and support of the democratic government, they reclaimed wasteland, planted trees, and rebuilt their homes. Now, the vast river滩 are dotted with patches of lush green wheat fields, and in the middle of the wheat fields are villages surrounded by willow trees. The streets are tidy, and the houses are spacious, obviously built according to a plan.\n    In the past, Dongping Prefecture suffered from the Yellow River, and it was said that \"nine out of ten years were bad harvests.\" Since the Yellow River changed its course and this area became a Liberated Area, those terrible things have completely become a thing of the past. The Jilu Yu Administrative Office spent 180,000 yuan specifically on managing the lake. Three hundred qing of barren lake land has been turned into fertile fields, yielding 300 jin of wheat per mu. Dongping Lake is connected to the Grand Canal, and the Grand Canal is connected to the Yellow River. If the Yellow River returns, these lake lands will all be turned into nothing.\n    The area northeast of Lijin near the sea used to be entirely barren, covered with brambles, unable to grow any crops. Rabbits ran everywhere in the fields. After the War of Resistance, this also became a Liberated Area. People from Shouguang, Anqiu... came to reclaim the wasteland. The government issued 2.6 million yuan in wasteland reclamation loans. People cut through thorns and brambles, planting while fighting against the invading enemy. A new life was established, and the population increased from 50,000 to 300,000, with three-sevenths of the population living above the level of middle peasants. There were no dikes here originally. After the Yellow River returns to its old course, the floods will inevitably overflow, and these people who have shed blood and sweat and contributed to the country will face the misfortune of displacement.\n    The impact of \"Returning the Yellow River to its Old Course\" is too great. In just Yuncheng, Juan, Pu, Shou, Fan, and Kun six counties, 856 villages will be submerged underwater, and more than 379,000 people will lose their lives and homes.\n            II. Natural Disaster? Man-made Calamity?\n    After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the open secret of the Yellow River breaching its banks at Huayuankou in Zhongmu in 1938 was revealed. It was originally ordered by Chiang Kai-shek to be dug by Ma Hongda. It is not surprising that the heroes who insisted on one-party dictatorship often lost battles. The problem is that these people never repent, but instead wager on the lives and property of the people. As a result, the surging Yellow River flowed thousands of li, and sixteen counties in eastern Henan, including Zhongmu, Weishi, and northern Anhui, including Taihe and Tangyin, were submerged. More than 300,000 people died unnaturally, and six million people lost their homes. The man-made disaster was equivalent to wiping out a Belgium, or exterminating a Luxembourg.\n    The Yellow River has always been known for its hundreds of harms, as recorded in historical records. Over the generations, governing the Yellow River has baffled many water conservancy experts. Although there are many reasons, the most important is that this natural disaster has always been combined with man-made disasters, and the two are both causes and effects of each other. From the second year of the Republic of China to the twenty-third year, the Yellow River breached its banks twelve times within the current Jilu Yu Liberated Area, and the number of breaches increased proportionally each year. Governing the Yellow River was regarded as a way to get rich, cutting corners and being perfunctory. If the Yellow River did not breach, it would be against \"natural principles.\" The reason why the masses along the river insisted that the river management organization must have representatives from the Liberated Areas is this. From 1938 to 1945, the breach index increased even more dramatically, with nine breaches in eight years, each with several breaches). And they were all dug by the Kuomintang.\n    The Kuomintang reactionaries would say: \"I breached the Yellow River in 1938 to stop the enemy and defend the Central Plains.\" Whether the Central Plains was defended because of this has been proven by the facts in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and we will not discuss it here. We will only say that the purpose of the subsequent breaches was entirely to submerge the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the simple people in eastern Henan who insisted on resisting Japan. For example:\n    In 1940, Ruan Chuang's troops of the Kuomintang Pan-East Guerrilla Detachment breached two places in Guocun, Xihua, with the aim of submerging our Twelfth Military Sub-district's Huaitai West troops.\n    In 1943, the Kuomintang launched a large-scale \"suppression\" of the New Fourth Army in eastern Henan. Because the New Fourth Army had the support of the masses and could not be suppressed, Liang Hualong of the Third Brigade of the Twelfth Special Commissioner's Office of Henan dug thirteen breaches in Gutong, Liukou, and other places, attempting to bring our military and civilians resisting Japan to the same end.\n    In 1944, Zhang Gongda of the Kuomintang Pan-East Advance Army dug the Lingkou in Fugou, completely submerging the fields that had been sown by the people of eastern Henan and our army, attempting to starve us to death.\n    On September 4, 1945, Cao Shi's troops of the Kuomintang Pan-East Advance Army dug the Shuibokou, and the surging Yellow River surged towards our counter-attacking army. At this time, we had liberated Fugou and were advancing towards Yanling (the puppet troops lived in Yanling City). The flood blocked our army's advance.\n    On September 25, 1945, Ma Huaicheng, the independent detachment of the Kuomintang Pan-East \"Communist Suppression,\" breached the Qingheyi dike east of Xihua. At this time, our army was preparing to recover Taikang, and the flood created a blocked area, adding many difficulties to our army.\n    The losses caused by these breaches to the military and civilians resisting Japan in eastern Henan will probably never be calculated. The purpose of the Kuomintang's \"Returning the Yellow River to its Old Course\" this time is to separate the Liberated Areas of Shandong, eastern Henan, central Jiangsu, and northern Jiangsu from North China. It is part of the Kuomintang's overall conspiracy for civil war.\n            III. The Focus of the Problem\n    The democratic government of the Liberated Areas and the vast majority of the people know what \"Returning the Yellow River to its Old Course\" will bring them. But they did not oppose \"Returning the Yellow River to its Old Course.\"\n    Understanding the suffering of the people in the Yellow River flood area, they silently bore the heavy burden of \"Returning the Yellow River to its Old Course.\" The question is how to \"return.\"\n    On April 15, representatives from the Kuomintang, the Liberated Areas, and the United States reached an agreement in Heze, stipulating that the river should be dredged and the dikes repaired first, and then the breach should be closed and the water released; the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission should submit a request to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to effectively provide relief to the affected people along the river, giving each person 100,000 yuan (legal tender) for relocation expenses, and the river management organization should be jointly composed of representatives from the Kuomintang and the Liberated Areas.\n    However, the ink on the Heze agreement was not yet dry when the Kuomintang tore up the agreement. Perhaps it never intended to implement it when it made this agreement. Its propaganda organ, the Central News Agency, said: \"The dike restoration work has been agreed upon with the Communists and can be completed simultaneously with the Huayuankou closing work within two months.\" This is a blatant lie. Anyone with clear eyes can see that not only has the two sides not \"agreed\" to this, but such a huge dredging and dike restoration project cannot be completed this year at all. The Central News Agency has always slandered the Liberated Areas. At this time, it said: \"The people in the CCP area are organized and have huge manpower and material resources,\" but \"obstruct the progress of the river project.\" This is clearly an attempt to find an excuse for releasing the river water.\n    Zhao Mingfu, the representative of the Liberated Areas, saw this situation and personally went to Huayuankou, and also met with the Kuomintang representatives to discuss and agree that the riverbed should be measured first in the lower reaches of the old course before the wheat harvest, and the river should be dredged and ditches cut in the autumn, the dangerous works should be repaired in the spring of next year, and then the breach should be closed and the water released. However, the Kuomintang, which is accustomed to going back on its word, immediately changed its mind again. It stubbornly insisted that the entire project must be completed within two months.\n    Rather than saying that the Kuomintang never cares about the lives and deaths of the people, it is better to say that its every move is intentionally putting the people to death. Although the dike restoration and dredging project of the old course is far from completion, the closing project of Huayuankou is almost complete. This 1,600-meter breach has been \"rushed\" from both sides continuously, leaving only 600 meters in the middle that has not yet been closed. Since the Republic of China, every Yellow River breach has always been closed in a year of good harvest, and some have even been delayed until the third year. At that time, the Kuomintang acted slowly, but this time it is particularly active. They brought in cars, built railways, brutally whipped the forced laborers, and endlessly requisitioned various materials. The purpose is to release the water as soon as possible, turning the Liberated Areas along the river into a watery country.\n    The day of the Huayuankou closure is almost the time of the great flood. The overwhelming Yellow River water will flow horizontally, and millions of lives will be thrown onto the line of death.\n    Faced with this great conspiracy, another \"Belgium\" will be destroyed.\n    People of the whole country, be vigilant and save these seven million compatriots who are about to be destroyed!\n    The people of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong, mobilize and insist on thoroughly implementing the Heze agreement, and use your own strength to safeguard your own lives!\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    China\n黄河    Yellow River\n荷泽    Heze\n濮县    Puyang County\n开封    Kaifeng\n冀鲁豫行署

四月九日，五辆吉普车载着黄河勘察团从荷泽出发，沿着黄河故道，由西南向东北驶去。车上插着写有“黄河”两字的小旗。\n    “黄河要回来了！”濮县的老百姓作梦都遇到重新袭来的滔天黄水。恐惧袭击着沿河几百万居民。\n    今年一年里国民党就提出“黄河归故”。解放区因为这是个关系几百万人命的大事情，马上派遣自己的代表和国民党磋商，开封会议之后，由三方代表合组勘察团，赴黄河故道勘察，以决定施工合龙计划，和救济的办法。\n    吉普车带着神秘的消息驶过来。人们看见西装革履的国民党代表，他们更加惊愕了。他们知道这些人就是过去负责“治黄”，贪污中饱而使黄河经常决口的人。他们的到来，只会给自己增加更多的不幸。但是，他们又看到了自己的代表——冀鲁豫行署曹心斋主任及孙明甫等，于是他们安心了。他们请愿、他们哭诉，希望代表们能够看到这个近三十县七百万人生死攸关的大问题，先复堤浚河，再合龙放水，同时切实救济被害的人民。他们知道国民党代表靠不住，因此，他们要求治河机构中一定要有自己的代表。\n    一周的勘察，给人的印象是毁灭和新生。\n    两千里的河堤，已经完全支离破碎了，许多地方被敌伪挖成了封锁沟，许多地方被农民改成了耕地。再加上风吹雨打，使许多段河堤连痕迹都没有了。黄河水利委员会委员长赵守钰也说：“百分之三十的堤坝须要完全重新修补。”\n    不真去看看黄河故道，很难想像它的可怕。由于堤坝的破坏，许多段河身高出地面一丈二到两丈，这种俗语所说的“悬河”，全是过去统治者只治标、不治本，徒斤斤于“九仞之城”的结果。防险的石坝大多已经坍塌，在积沙的河身上，矗立着一座座骇人的淤滩……。这样大的工程，短期内是绝对不能完成的。在冀鲁豫解放区内的河身共长一四二六里，如果完全修好，至少须筑三千五百万土方，用人工二千三百三十万个——怕人的数字！\n    但是，沿着黄河故道走一遭，就同时能够看到民主政府和群众力量的伟大。自从这里成了解放区，过去因洪水泛滥而逃亡在外的人们都回来了。他们在民主政府领导与扶值下，垦荒植树，重新建立自己的家园。现在广袤的河滩里，点缀起一片片油绿的麦田，麦田中间是被杨柳树拱围着的村庄，街道整齐、房屋宽敞，显然是有计划的建造起来的。\n    东平州过去黄水为患，语称“十年九不收。”自从黄河改道，这里建立了解放区以后，那种怕人的事情完全成为过去了。冀鲁豫行署曾以十八万元专门治湖。三百顷瘠硗的湖地变为良田，每亩可收获三百斤麦子。东平湖与运河相连，运河又与黄河相通，如果黄河重来，这些湖地都将化为乌有。\n    利津东北近海的地方曾经全为荒区，荆条遍地，五谷不生，田野里到处奔驰着兔子，抗战后这里也成了解放区，寿光、安邱……的人纷纷赶来垦荒。政府发放了二百六十万元垦荒贷款。人们披荆斩棘，一面垦植，一面和进攻的敌人打仗。新生活建立起来了，人口由五万增至三十万，七分之三的人口过着中农以上的生活。这里原先就没有堤坝，黄河归故之后，必致洪流漫流，这些流血流汗、功在国家的人民，又要遭逢流离失所的厄运。\n    “黄河归故”的影响太大了，仅郓、鄄、濮、寿、范、昆六县，就将有八百五十六个村庄陆沉水底，三十七万九千多人口，要失掉生命和家园。\n            二、天灾？人祸？\n    抗战胜利之后，三八年黄河在中牟花园口溃决的公开秘密揭破了。原是蒋介石命令马鸿达掘开的。坚持一党专政的英雄们常打败仗原无足奇，问题在于这些人们永远不自悔悟，却以人民的生命财产作赌注。以至滚滚黄河一泻千里，豫东的中牟、尉氏及皖北的太和、汤阴等十六县随之陆沉。三十多万人死于非命，六百万人失掉了家园。人为的灾害等于消灭了一个比利时，死绝了一个卢森堡。\n    黄河百害，早经载诸史籍。历代治黄，不知难倒了多少水利专家。其中原因虽多，但最重要的一项，是这种天灾始终与人祸相结合，二者并互为因果。从民国二年至二十三年，黄河在现冀鲁豫解放区范围内决口达十二次，决口次数且在按比例逐年增加。治黄被视作发财之道，偷工减料，苟且敷衍，黄河不决，是无“天理”。沿河群众坚持治河机构一定要有解放区代表参加，就是这个缘故。从三八年到四五年，决口指数更是飞跃增加，八年中竟有九次，每次均决口数处）。而且都是国民党掘开的。\n    国民党反动派会说：“我在三八年决开黄河，是为了阻止敌人，保卫中原。”中原是否因此保卫住了，已为抗战中的事实所证明，这里不去说它，只说以后的几次，其目的竟是完全为了淹没豫东坚持抗战的八路军、新四军和淳朴的人民。例如：\n    四○年，国民党泛东游击支队阮创部在西华郭村决口两处，目的在淹没我十二分区淮太西部队。\n    四三年，国民党在豫东大“剿”新四军，因为新四军有群众拥护，剿不了，于是国民党河南十二专署第三大队梁化龙就在古铜、刘口等地决口十三处，企图使我抗战军民同归于尽。\n    四四年，国民党泛东挺进军张公达掘开扶沟陵口，把豫东人民及我军已播种的田地完全淹没，企图把我们饿死。\n    四五年九月四日，国民党泛东挺进军曹世部掘开水波口，滚滚黄河向我反攻大军汹涌而来，这时我已解放扶沟，正向鄢陵挺进（鄢陵城内住的是伪军）。被洪水阻绝了我军的进路。\n    四五年九月二十五日，国民党泛东“剿共”独立支队马淮诚决开西华以东清河驿堤，这时我军正布置收复太康，洪水造成一片阻绝地带，给我军增加了许多困难。\n    这些决口给予豫东抗战军民的损失，恐怕永远也算不清的。这次国民党要“黄河归故”的目的，是在把山东、豫东、苏中、苏北等解放区与华北分割开来，是国民党全面内战阴谋的一部分。\n            三、问题的焦点\n    解放区民主政府和广大人民深知“黄河归故”将带给他们什么。但是他们并没有反对“黄河归故”。\n    体念黄泛区人民的痛苦，他们默默无言的承受了“黄河归故”这副沉重的担子。问题在于怎么个“归”法。\n    四月十五日，国民党、解放区及美方代表在荷泽成立了协议，规定先浚河修堤、后合龙放水；由黄委会呈请联总行总切实救济沿河难胞，每人发给十万元（法币）迁移费，治河机构由国民党、解放区双方代表共同组成。\n    但是，荷泽协议墨迹未干，国民党就撕毁了这一协定。也许，在订定这个协议时它就没有准备实行。它的宣传机关中央社说：“复堤工作已与共方商定，可于两月内配合花园口堵口工作同时完成。”这是瞪着眼睛造谣，明眼人一看便知，不但双方并未这么“商定”，而且像这样浩大的浚河复堤工作，本年内根本不能完成。中央社是一贯诬蔑解放区的，在这时候它却说：“中共区民众有组织，有庞大的人力物力”，但是“阻挠河工之进行。”这显然是企图率甚河水的借口。\n    解放区代表赵明甫氏看到这种情形，特亲自到花园口跑了一遭，又和国民党代表会谈，商定故道下游于麦收前先测量河床，秋后浚河并裁沟取道，明春修理险工，最后再合龙放水。但是，惯于自食其言的国民党马上又变了卦，它顽固的坚持要在两个月内全部完工。\n    与其说国民党从来不管人民的死活，无宁说它的一举一动，都是有意制人民于死命。故道的复堤浚河工程虽离完成尚远，但花园口的堵口工程却已差不多了。这个一千六百公尺的决口，连续从两边“抢修”，中间只剩了六百公尺尚未合龙。民国以来历次黄河决口，总是丰年合龙，甚至有迟至第三年者。那时候国民党迟迟其行，这次却特别积极了。它们调来汽车，修了铁路，残酷的鞭打着强拉来的民夫，无限止的强征各种材料。为的是尽早放过水来，使沿河的解放区变成泽国。\n    花园口合龙之日，差不多正是大泛之时，滔天的黄水就要横流过来，几百万条生命将要被抛到到死亡线上。\n    面临着这个天大的阴谋，又一个“比利时”将被毁灭了。\n    全国人民警惕起来，拯救这七百万将被毁灭的同胞！\n    河南、河北、山东的人民动员起来，坚持彻底实现荷泽协议，用自己的力量维护自己的生命！"

    "content": "Random Thoughts in May\n    Whenever I turn the calendar to May, I always feel a bit heavy. There are simply too many shocking days of bloodshed, tyranny, and humiliation: May Third, May Seventh, May Ninth, May Thirtieth, May Thirty-first... Although there are also two glorious holidays, May First and May Fourth, after all, they are also connected to bloodshed, tyranny, or humiliation.\n    This May, when I opened the calendar, I had a peculiar thought. I thought: the unequal treaties were abolished three years ago, and last August, the national enemy Japan surrendered. Then, on our calendar, we should also erase this large debt of bloodshed, tyranny, and humiliation. It would be best to leave only pleasant and joyful holidays, so that when I look at the calendar in the second half of my life, I no longer feel the weight of humiliation on my shoulders, and my eyes are not filled with pools of blood.\n    But after all, a peculiar thought is just a peculiar thought. There are some people in China with special hobbies, who take humiliation as glory, tyranny as benevolent governance, and the blood of the people as fine wine. Students in Kunming shed blood, students in Shanghai shed blood, famous scholars in Chongqing who fought for freedom and democracy for the people shed blood, journalists in Nantong and Xi'an shed blood, and university professors in Beiping also shed blood. In just half a year, new tragedies and new massacres have followed one after another, far more than the cases accumulated on the calendar for many years. As for arbitrarily arresting people, destroying newspaper offices and venues, confiscating books and newspapers, breaking into private homes and public residences, and assassinating anti-Japanese generals, in the eyes of the Kuomintang authorities, these are just trivial matters, truly one generation surpassing another.\n    In the Beiping Zhongshan Park tragedy, the Mr. Jiang Shaoyuan who was beaten was precisely the very person who burned Cao Rulin's residence in Zhao Jia Lou during the May Fourth Movement. Twenty-eight years ago, during the era of the Northern Warlords, students still had the freedom to burn down the residences of traitors. But twenty-eight years later, when the \"promise\" of the four major freedoms is supposedly in place, a professor, merely after giving a few moderate speeches about peace and democracy, is beaten until his head is broken and bleeding. Look at how domineering the modern Kuomintang reactionaries truly are!\n    So domineering that they won't allow people to speak, won't allow meetings, won't allow articles to be written, won't allow newspapers to be published, forcing everyone to obediently stretch out their necks and be manipulated. If they show the slightest resistance, then all kinds of weapons from the century before to the twentieth century – stones, clubs, grenades, rifles, rocket launchers, airplanes – will all come rushing over.\n    However, reactionaries, don't be complacent. Although you create tragedies more fiercely and frequently than your predecessors, the people, through a century of bloodshed, have not only not been intimidated, but have also learned to be wiser, more steadfast, and more courageous from their own bloodshed. We will still speak! We will still reason! We will still write articles! We will still publish newspapers! Let me remind you, Fascists! Creating tragedies will not intimidate the people. If you still want to create more new tragedies to feel satisfied, then your path to follow the path your predecessors took is certain.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n五三    May Third\n五七    May Seventh\n五九    May Ninth\n五卅    May Thirtieth\n五卅一  May Thirty-first\n五一    May First\n五四    May Fourth\n昆明    Kunming\n上海    Shanghai\n重庆    Chongqing\n南通    Nantong\n西安    Xi'an\n北平    Beiping\n江绍原  Jiang Shaoyuan\n赵家楼  Zhao Jia Lou\n曹汝霖  Cao Rulin\n中山公园  Zhongshan Park\n国民党  Kuomintang\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 五月杂感\n张香山\n1946-05-15\n第4版()\n专栏：\n\n　　五月杂感\n    一到日历翻掀到五月，总感到有些沉重，那种触目惊心的流血，暴虐耻辱的日子，实在太多了——五三、五七、五九、五卅、五卅一……虽其间也有像五一、五四这两个光荣的节日，但毕竟它与流血暴虐或耻辱也有过连系的。\n    今年五月，我一翻开日历，却发生了一种异想，我想：不平等条约在三年前废除了，去年八月，民族的劲敌日本投降了，那末在我们的日历上，也该抹消掉这一大笔流血暴虐和耻辱的旧账才好。尽可光留些愉快欢娱的节日，让我这后半辈瞧日历时，不再觉得肩上压有千斤的耻辱，满眼是一滩滩的鲜血。\n    但异想毕竟是异想，中国偏偏有一些特殊嗜好的人们，拿耻辱当光荣，拿暴虐当仁政，拿人民的鲜血当美酒的；昆明的学生流了血，上海的学生流了血，重庆替人民争自由民主的名流学者流了血，南通和西安的新闻记者流了血，北平的大学教授也流了血。短短半年之中，新惨案新屠杀是接踵而至，倒比日历上积累了多少年月的案件，多得不可同日而语。至于任意逮捕人民，捣毁报馆会场，没收书报，闯入民宅公馆，暗杀抗日名将，这在国民党当局老爷们看来，不过像头般的小事，也真是一代胜过一代。\n    在北平中山公园惨案中，那个被殴的江绍原先生，正是五四时火烧赵家楼曹汝霖公馆的张本人。二十八年前，北洋军阀时代倒还有学生火烧卖国贼公馆的自由，但在二十八年后，据说是四大自由有了“诺言”的时候，以教授的身份，仅温和的讲了几句和平民主的话，就要被打得头破血流，你看现代的国民党反动派，真是霸道到什么地步！\n    霸道到要人民话不许讲，会不许开，文章不许写，报纸不许出，大家服服贴贴，伸长脖子，一仟摆布，如果稍示反抗，那么从世纪前到二十世纪的各色武器——石头、棍棒、手榴弹、步枪、火箭炮、飞机，都一劲儿的冲了过来。\n    可是，反动派你且不要得意，尽管你制造惨案要比你先人凶而且多，但人民也在这百年来的流血中，不仅没有被吓倒，而且也从自己的流血中，学得更智慧、更坚定、更勇敢了；话依旧要讲！理依旧要评！文章依旧要写！报纸依旧要出，让我提醒你一句法西斯派！制造惨案是吓不倒人民的，如果你还要一劲儿制造更多的新惨案才觉过瘾，那么你要走上你们先人所走过的道路，是肯定了的。"

Among them were more than ten members of the Jinan Executive Headquarters and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Because the transportation of these supplies had neither been notified in advance nor had any letters of proof, the Eighth Route Army there immediately conducted an inspection according to law, as they attempted to transport them into Liaocheng, which was occupied by puppet troops. A handwritten letter from He Siyuan to the puppet troops in the city, along with twenty-five other anti-communist documents, and 20 million 法币 (legal tender) attached for the support of the puppet troops, were discovered. In his letter, He encouraged the puppet troops to hold fast and wait for an opportunity, and guaranteed to transport ammunition and supplies by plane. He also stated: \"The Shandong Military Region\" has been arranged and will attack Linqing from Gaotang, as well as Liaocheng. The Eighth Route Army authorities questioned Mr. Hawkins, the American representative of the Executive Headquarters, Gu Zili, the Kuomintang representative, and John, the representative of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. They claimed that these documents had nothing to do with them and apologized on the spot. The three parties then discussed the matter in detail and reached the following agreement: (1) The illegally seized documents will be kept by the Communist Party, and the Executive Headquarters will investigate their origin and severely punish the carriers. (2) From the seized documents, it is proved that He Siyuan prepared to transport bullets by plane to support the puppet troops in the city. All parties believe that this is an act of sabotaging the ceasefire agreement. The CCP will not be responsible for any unexpected events caused by this in the future. The seized 20 million 法币 was proved by illegal documents to be used by He Siyuan to support the puppet troops, and should be confiscated. After consultation, all parties agreed to use the money to provide relief to refugees inside and outside the city, but because the puppet troops in the city did not allow residents to leave the city to receive it, the money will be handed over to the organized relief committee for safekeeping for future disposal.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n何思源  He Siyuan\n聊城  Liaocheng\n济南  Jinan\n临清  Linqing\n高唐  Gaotang\n顾自立  Gu Zili\n\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n八路军  Eighth Route Army\n山东军区  Shandong Military Region\n济南执行小组  Jinan Executive Headquarters\n救济总署  Relief and Rehabilitation Administration\n中共  CCP\n\n郝金斯  Hawkins\n纳约翰  John\n\n法币  fǎbì\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 何思源图谋进攻解放区  密运物资予聊城伪军  大批反共文件一并为我查获\n\n1946-05-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　何思源图谋进攻解放区\n    密运物资予聊城伪军\n    大批反共文件一并为我查获\n    【新华社荷泽十一日电】三日晚有汽车十余辆，载运大批物资，由济南驶经聊城八路军驻地，拟开入聊城城内，内有济南执行小组及救济总署人员十余人，该地八路军以运输是项物资，事先既未得到通知，又无任何证明函件，竟欲运入伪军盘据之聊城，当即依法予以检查，查得何思源致该城伪军的亲笔信一件，及其他反共文件二十五件，并附接济伪军之法币二千万元。何氏在其信中，鼓励伪军坚守待机，并保证以飞机运送弹药及物资。又称：“山东军区”已布置就绪，将由高唐进攻临清，聊城云云。八路军当局向执行小组美代表郝金斯、国民党代表顾自立、救济总署代表纳约翰，提出质询，彼等声称此种文件与他们无关，并当面道歉，三方旋将此事详细商谈，取得如下协议：（１）查获之非法文件，由中共方面保存，由小组追究其来源，予携带者以严重处分。（２）从查获文件中，证明何思源准备以飞机运送子弹支援城内伪军，各方认为此系破坏停战协议之举，今后如因此引起意外事件，中共概不负责。查获之法币二千万元，从非法文件中证明系何思源接济伪军之用，理应予以以没收，现经各方协议，将该款救济城内外难民，但由于城内伪军不放居民出城领取，该款将交所组织之救济委员会收存，以备将来处理。"

    "content": "*JiluYu Daily* Publishes Editorial\n    Insist on Implementing the Heze River Management Agreement\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Heze, 8th] The *JiluYu Daily* published an editorial on the 7th titled \"Insist on Implementing the Heze River Diversion Agreement,\" stating: The issue of the Yellow River returning to its old course is a momentous event for the Border Region, concerning the lives and property of tens of millions of people. Therefore, millions of people in the Border Region are watching this issue with their eyes wide open. After the Heze River Management Agreement was established, millions of people in Chongqing could be spared from disaster. Unexpectedly, immediately after the survey team returned to Kaifeng, the Kuomintang authorities changed their minds again. On one hand, they used the Central News Agency to spread rumors, saying: \"The work of blocking the breach and releasing water will be completed within two months, and the consent of the Communist side has been obtained.\" On the other hand, they instigated the UNRRA to threaten the river management agency with the termination of all supplies, insisting that the breach-blocking project be completed within two months. From the above process, it is not difficult to understand what the Kuomintang authorities' intentions are regarding river management. Their proclaimed \"river management and dredging\" is actually blocking the breach and releasing water, creating floods; their so-called \"promoting benefits and eliminating harm\" is actually harming the people; their so-called \"relieving the people\" is actually taking the people's lives, wanting the lives and property of millions of compatriots north of the Longhai Railway to be swallowed by floods. The Central News Agency and all Kuomintang newspapers chorused: \"The Chinese Communist side possesses abundant manpower and resources, and has a strict organization, sufficient to complete the embankment restoration and river management project simultaneously with the Huayuankou breach-blocking project within two months.\" What a huge conspiracy! During the river channel survey, Chairman Zhao of the Yellow River Commission and the engineers of the commission repeatedly expressed to us: \"The project is too vast and cannot be completed in a short period of time. The Kuomintang authorities breached Zhongmu seven or eight years ago, causing unprecedented disasters to the people of Henan. Now, we should immediately provide relief to the disaster victims in Henan, and regard embankment restoration, river dredging, and relief to the people of Henan as equally important. The current situation is very dangerous, and all the comrades in the Border Region are now facing the threat of death, watching their wives, children, and elders being washed away by the Yellow River. The people of the Border Region cannot tolerate such evil actions by the reactionaries and will unite, regardless of rich or poor, male or female, young or old, to take necessary actions. We demand that the people of the whole country pay attention to this event and provide righteous assistance. We demand that the Kuomintang authorities immediately stop the breach-blocking project, handle embankment restoration, river dredging, and relief matters, and faithfully implement the Heze Agreement. Otherwise, it will inevitably arouse the unstoppable anger of millions of people in the Border Region, and the Kuomintang authorities shall bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.\"\n\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n*People:*\n\n赵委员长   Zhao Weiyuanzhang\n\n*Places:*\n\n冀鲁豫  JiluYu (Hebei-Shandong-Henan)\n荷泽  Heze\n重庆  Chongqing\n开封  Kaifeng\n陇海路  Longhai Railway\n中牟  Zhongmu\n河南  Henan\n花园口  Huayuankou\n\n*Organizations:*\n\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n中央社  Central News Agency\n联总行总  UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration)\n黄委会   Yellow River Commission\n国民党  Kuomintang\n中共    Chinese Communist Party\n\n*Events:*\n\n荷泽治河协定  Heze River Management Agreement\n花园口堵口工程  Huayuankou breach-blocking project\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫日报发表社论  坚持实现荷泽治河协定\n\n1946-05-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀鲁豫日报发表社论\n    坚持实现荷泽治河协定\n    【新华社荷泽八日电】冀鲁豫日报于七日以“坚持实行荷泽治河改道协定”为题，发表社论称：黄河改道归故问题，在边区说来，是一件天大的事件，是有关数千万人民生命财产的问题，所以边区千百万人民，都睁着眼睛注视着这一问题。荷泽治河协定成立后，数百万群众重庆可免于难。不料勘察甫回开封，国民党当局却又变卦了，他们一面经中央社广播造谣说：“两个月内要完成堵口放水，并已征得共方的同意”，一面唆使联总行总以断绝一切供给来威胁治河机关，一定要在两月完成堵口工程。从以上经过，也就不难明白国民党当局治河的企图是什么了。他们标榜的“治河开道”，原来就是堵口放水，制造洪水；他们所谓“兴利除害”，原来是祸害人民；他们所谓“救济人民”，原来是要人民的命，是要陇海路北千百万同胞的生命财产付诸洪水。中央社和国民党的一切报纸，都异口同声的说：“中共方面握有雄厚的人力物力，有严密的组织，足以能在两个月内把复堤治河工程配合花园口堵口工程同时完成。”这是多大的一个阴谋！在勘察河道时，黄委会赵委员长及该会诸工程师等，也一再向我们表示：“工程过于浩大，短期内绝不能完工，国民党当局在七八年前决口中牟，造成河南同胞空前的灾难，现在应立即救济河南灾胞，应将复堤浚河与救济河南同胞看成同等重要。目前的形势已非常危险，现在全边区的同胞已面临着死亡的威胁，眼看着自己的妻子老少将被黄水荡尽。边区人民是不能容忍反动派这样万恶的行为的，会不分贫富、不分男女老幼的团结起来，采取必要的行动。我们要求全国人民注意这一事件，给以正义的援助，我们要求国民党当局立即制止堵口工程，办理复堤浚河救济等事项，忠实实践荷泽协定，否则势必激起全边区千百万人民不可抑止的愤怒，因此而引起的一切后果，应由国民党当局负完全责任。"

The day before I was to leave Liangyu for Wuxiang, groups of women came to see me off. Each one said as soon as they entered:\n　　“Why are you leaving so soon? Stay a few more days! Help us to better develop the textile work.”\n　　Looking at their faces, reddened by the mountain wind, their sturdy figures, and listening to their enthusiastic words, I was indeed reluctant to leave them immediately. I repeatedly asked them to sit down on the kang so that we could talk for a few more minutes before parting. But they were always eager to brush off the manure clinging to their old clothes, some even wiping the sweat from their foreheads with their sleeves, as if they couldn't sit still. They said to me:\n　　“We are busy delivering manure to the fields! We heard you were leaving, and everyone wanted to come and see you. Our mutual aid team discussed it, and we are taking turns coming, but we can't sit for too long, or we'll be criticized for missing work.”\n　　So, I didn't try to keep them any longer, but according to each of their requests, I wrote my name in their study notebooks, along with simple words of encouragement and hope.\n\n　　All day long, my room was never empty. They came and went, and went and came again, with deep affection.\n\n　　For the sake of the next day's journey, I went to bed early that night. Just as I was about to blow out the lamp and prepare to sleep, suddenly, my door, which was latched from the outside, was pushed open by someone who had rushed over.\n\n　　“Gaimei, why have you come running over at this hour?” I asked in surprise as I recognized the familiar face of the person who had entered in the lamplight.\n\n　　She didn't bother to speak, but ran to my kang, pressed her hands on my upper body to stop me from sitting up, and, leaning over my pillow, said breathlessly:\n　　“I'll see you off tomorrow morning! The village chief just told me at my house, and I was so happy, I couldn't help but come and tell you, or I wouldn't be able to sleep all night.”\n　　Her dark eyes looked straight at me, and she said as innocently as a child:\n　　“I'm telling you, my donkey is the most hardworking in the whole village. Tonight, I'll take special care to feed it. You should rest well!”\n\n　　After speaking, she stood up to leave. I grabbed her arm, and said uneasily:\n　　“Isn't there anyone else at home who can go? Asking you to run back and forth seventy or eighty li in a day, I'm afraid you'll be exhausted!”\n　　“What are you saying? Even if there was someone at home, I would still have to see you off tomorrow. This is a rare opportunity, and the other women are envious! Who wouldn't want to see you off? You've lived in our village for a month, and you know that everything in Liangyu depends on us women. Carrying stretchers, walking dozens of li, what's it to help you drive the animals? I'll take care of Little Slowpoke (note) along the way. I can be back before dark.” She said with her dark eyes wide open and full of reason.\n\n　　I was moved by her kind and resolute words. I stroked her head wrapped in a white towel and said sincerely:\n　　“I would love for you to see me off! It would be best if you could stay with me in Hongshui for one night and then return the next day. We can talk and have fun, and you can look around. Talk it over with your family and see what they say.”\n\n　　She agreed with my suggestion. She was so happy that she could hardly speak. After a moment, she squeezed my hand hard and turned to run. Her short stature was as nimble as when she led the young women in running every morning, and she quickly darted out of the room. After carefully latching the door for me, she said softly from the crack in the door:\n　　“I'll be ready early tomorrow.”\n\n　　Like having drunk a few cups of strong, hot wine, the women's squad leader's late-night visit stimulated me so much that I couldn't sleep at all. I was excitedly thinking about Gaimei, and all the women in Liangyu village who were like her. Their diligent, hardworking, and simple figures, a series of vivid memories, were all active before my eyes.\n\n　　I remember that the day I first arrived in the village, it was just after the Lantern Festival. According to the customs of the rural people, it was still a good time for rest and recreation, but I saw many women carrying baskets and picking up manure everywhere, many of them white-haired old women. The people who saw them all encouraged them in the same respectful voice:\n　　“Keep it up, labor heroes!”\n　　The women picking up manure would raise their heads and smile, shake their heads with an embarrassed expression, and then bend down and work hard again.\n\n　　Walking into the village, a miraculous scene entered my eyes. There was not a single young man to be seen on the streets. All who were active everywhere were long-bearded old men, middle-aged men and women, and children. Many women, striding with big feet and chests held high, walked quickly back and forth carrying large buckets of water. As soon as they came to me, they put down the water buckets and, as if they had seen their most familiar relatives and friends, vied with each other to invite me to their homes.\n　　I patted their hard shoulders and praised them:\n　　“What a skill! Carrying such big buckets of water.”\n　　“Good comrade, this is the ordinary work of the women in our place. Anyone can do it. The men have all gone to fight the Japanese, and the women have to eat, and they can bear it.” They replied in unison.\n\n　　When I lived among them and gradually became familiar with them, they unreservedly poured out their heartfelt words to me: their pain, joy, and hope. In this way, I also gained a more specific and comprehensive understanding of the disasters they had endured, the heroic struggles, their liberation, progress, and the democratic and free life they now enjoyed. These stories, full of blood and tears, magnificent, vivid, and rich, left me with a deep and indelible memory. Tonight, this memory robbed me of my sleep for the first time.\n\n　　The few profound words that the Women's Federation Secretary Yi Shengyu often told me clearly lingered in my ears:\n　　“Almost all of our women are involved in the anti-Japanese movement, and there are also many glorious widows and mothers of martyrs. All the production and anti-Japanese work in the village depends on us. We are also the center of the labor mutual aid teams. Just think, of the eighty-six women in the village who are able to work, all but five or six who are old or disabled have joined the mutual aid teams.”\n\n　　These words, like what they did, are glorious and worthy of pride! In the eight years of cruel struggle against the enemy, their small village of eighty-odd households sent more than fifty young men to the anti-Japanese Eighth Route Army, and many militiamen made heroic and tragic sacrifices in the battles to defend the village. In the middle of this, the wives and mothers mobilized and encouraged their husbands and sons. They sent them to join the army, and fought alongside them. When they left the village, they straightened their chests, took on all the work they had left behind, and resolutely refused to maintain the enemy. I will never forget how each of them once told me how they shattered the enemy's intimidation and threats with their iron will. They said:\n　　“When the enemy came, all of us in the village ran to the mountains all around. I don't know how many times the devils set fire to the houses in the village, and the puppet soldiers shouted for us to go back and maintain them. We had long ago made up our minds that even if everything was burned to the ground, we would move to the gullies and wilderness to live, and we would not go back. The fire burned red in the sky, but no one's heart was moved... When the devils went back, we crawled into the fire, raked around, and lived there again, worked the land, spun cotton, wove cloth, and did what we were supposed to do. In the end, the devils couldn't do anything to us Liangyu people!”\n\n　　They recounted the hardships they had endured, remembered their dead or long-separated relatives, but their mood was open and cheerful.\n\n　　Yang Laijie, this young and enthusiastic widow who had lived independently with three children for five years, since she personally washed and dressed her militia husband, who had died in the enemy's bullets in a rainstorm in May 1941, and then buried and commemorated him with the villagers, she wiped away her tears, ate less and wore less in the war-torn life, used her own labor to raise her orphans, and never cried again. In the labor mutual aid team, she earned a full ten points every day for a full laborer, and received the glorious commendation of model every year. A few days earlier, at the March 8th Women's Day celebration, she learned from the newly learned commemorative song and the chairman's speech that women in the period of peace and construction should participate in production even better. So, at the meeting, in addition to enthusiastically proposing labor competitions to many women, she also guaranteed herself with an oath-like words:\n　　“The mutual aid team is like a family, and the team leader is our head of the family. I will accept his leadership and obey his distribution in everything. In the future, no matter if it's picking manure, harrowing the fields, sowing seeds, transplanting seedlings, harvesting grain, threshing, digging yams, I will work harder than any year, and I also plan to learn to weave cloth, to supply clothes for myself and my children.”\n\n　　Martyr's mother Fan Sannv, her four children with strong physiques and tenacious personalities, two of whom had sacrificed, one of whom had been lost, and the other of whom was working day and night as the village political director, was sick every other day. This old lady, although she was over sixty years old and her heart was full of scars, had a high degree of love for life and enough confidence and hope for the future. She worked vigorously like a young person in non-stop labor. Often late at night, one could still hear the buzzing of her spinning wheel turning in the dark. She carefully managed a group of grandchildren without fathers, so that her daughters-in-law could study culture in the people's school with peace of mind. During the most intense season of farming, in addition to cooking for her daughters-in-law working in the fields and carrying water with her eldest grandson, she also took on the responsibility of caring for the animals and all the work at home. The people of the whole village respected this working mother. After she was rewarded again at this memorial meeting, she said as she did when I first saw her:\n　　“The sons were all very resolute, and they died gloriously. Thinking of them, even if I am old, I will work as long as I can move!”\n\n　　Only the women who have truly been liberated under this democratic regime can use practical labor to commemorate their meaningful festivals. The memorial meeting was held concisely and substantively. Everyone, whether criticizing others, reviewing themselves, making plans, or making challenges, was sincere, serious, and without a single empty word or unrealistic fantasy. They issued strict and sharp warnings to a woman who was idle and wanted to divorce a man who could endure hardship:\n　　“In the people's school, we collectively educated her. The Women's Federation Secretary, the village chief, everyone talked to her. People are not stones, they should always change!”\n　　“She can't get a divorce, a man who can endure hardship is the best condition!”\n　　“It's no use hiding back at her mother's house. There are the same people's schools and mutual aid teams in her mother's village. Write her a transfer certificate, and she has to move there the same way. People live in their mother's house, but work cannot live in their mother's house!”\n\n　　In this heated and tense atmosphere, I found that Li Fengying, a member of the Women's Federation Standing Committee, who was sitting next to the stove in front, had been silent all the time. Her thin face was drooping on her chest, as if she had some deep thoughts. From time to time, she turned her eyes, somewhat ashamed, and secretly looked at me. This expression made a deep impression on me. Several times, she specially ran to see me, sat on the edge of my kang, and just looked at me with such eyes, moving her mouth to say something to me, but never said it.\n\n　　After the meeting, I followed behind the crowded people and automatically walked to her side, gently saying to her:\n　　“Fengying, let's go, I'll go to your house and play!”\n　　She grabbed my hand hard, expressing a warm welcome. We went to the back village.\n\n　　In the middle of a ruined wall destroyed by the enemy, there were two dilapidated houses. She pushed open the door and walked in with me, and let me sit on her kang, which only had a thin quilt on it.\n　　“Fengying, what's on your mind? Why are you always unhappy?” I opened my mouth first.\n　　She moved closer to me and said embarrassedly:\n　　“It's not unhappiness, I just feel too sorry for the work.”\n　　“If there's anything, let's talk about it.”\n　　“I wanted to talk to you a long time ago...” She sighed a long breath. “I couldn't stand the test myself...”\n　　I stroked her trembling shoulders and asked:\n　　“Fengying, what exactly is going on?”\n\n　　She forced a smile and said:\n　　“I have already recognized my mistakes, and I have been persuaded by other sisters, and I am not afraid of you laughing at me now.”\n　　She paused, and her expression became more natural as she continued:\n　　“After my man joined the army, I didn't even receive a letter. I was all alone, pulling a child, and I spent seven years in this empty house. Life was relatively difficult. When I went out to work and do production, it was booming, but when I came home, I felt helpless and lonely.” Her eyes were red, and she tried hard to suppress the crystal tears in her eyes. “Last year, the Independent Battalion lived here. The battalion commander was a good person, and often came to my house to check on me. Seeing my difficulties, he sometimes helped me carry water. As the days went by, we developed feelings for each other, and later he proposed to get engaged to me. At that time, I didn't tell the village or the Women's Federation Secretary about these things. But later, when I thought about it carefully, I felt that it shouldn't be done this way. When the man left, our feelings were good, and he let me wait for him at home, and joined the army early. People are fighting the war outside for the country and the people, and I should wait for him. I heard that many veteran cadres have been out for more than ten years and can't send letters home. In this way, I turned down the battalion commander.”\n　　I comforted her and said:\n　　“It's very right to deal with things this way! What else are you uneasy about?”\n　　She lowered her head, and after a long time, she said:\n　　“I am a person who is naturally good-natured. Whenever I think of this, I feel like there is a knot in my heart, and I feel like I have smeared ash on my face. In addition, I have been working since the establishment of the Women's Federation. My affair has a very bad influence on the dependents of the martyrs! So, I am always uncomfortable in my mind.”\n　　“I hope you will be happy. You have passed the test! You have new understanding, and in the future, you will work more actively, and in work and labor, you will be able to exercise our women's courage and ability to live independently even more!”\n\n　　She smiled easily, and her heart seemed to be relieved of a heavy burden. This smiling image is also floating before my eyes tonight. Among the women in Liangyu, there are many such lovable people who are responsible for their work, know how to cherish real feelings, seriously consider life issues, and think about the future, just like Fengying!\n\n　　Thinking of these new types of working women who have been tempered in battle and production, I haven't slept for a long time.\n\n　　When it was about to dawn, someone shouted in the yard:\n　　“The guesthouse is preparing to take over!”\n　　Someone grabbed and promised:\n　　“If there are any lottery numbers or errands to be assigned today, give priority to those of us who don't have children!”\n　　“It's all the same, there is no shortage of people in the fields!”\n　　Before long, a song, like every day, rang out in the village:\n　　……\n　　This year's March 8th is very different.\n　　Peace, construction, sisters! Increase production!\n　　New women can work, and they can do everything,\n　　Eating, dressing, sisters, don't rely on men.\n　　……\n　　Then the sound of the donkey's bells, the rough breathing of the old cow, mixed with the laughter and commotion of the women, flowed past my window facing the street and into the fields....\n\n　　(Note): In the second district of Zuoquan, small children are called

                             ——斯大林\n    左权的工作告了一个段落。当我要离开梁峪到武乡去的先一天，一起一起的妇女们，都跑来给我送行了。她们每个人都是一进门就说：\n    “你怎呢就要走？在俺们这多定上几天吧！帮助俺们把纺织好好开展开展。”\n    我看着她们一张张被山风吹得发红的脸，一个个健壮结实的体格，和听着她这样充满着热情的话，确实有些不愿马上离开她们了。我再三要她们到炕上坐下来，大家好在临别前多谈十几句话。可是，她们总急于拍打破旧的衣服上满沾的粪土，有的还用袖子抹着额头上的汗粒，像是安静不住的样子，对我说：\n    “俺们都是正忙着朝地里送粪呢！是听说你要走了，谁都想过来照照你。俺们互助组商量了一下，大家才轮流着来，可不敢多坐，误了班，还得挨批评哩。”\n    这样，我就没有再多留她们，只按照她们每个人的要求，一个个的在她们的学习本子上，写下了我的名字，和我对她们鼓励，希望的简单的话句。\n    一整天，我的屋子里没有断人。她们带着深深的依恋，来了去，去了又来。\n    为着第二天的行程，夜晚，我早点躺下了。当我正要吹熄了灯准备睡的时候，突然，我的从外面反扣着的房门，被一个匆匆跑来的人推开了。\n    “改梅，你怎么这个时候跑来了？”我从灯光中一发现进来的人的熟悉的面孔，就惊喜的问了一声。\n    她顾不得讲话，跑到我的炕前，两只手按着我要坐起的上身，伏在我的枕头边，喘吁吁的说：\n    “明儿早上，我去送你呵！村长刚刚一来俺家告诉，我就喜的了不得，我鳖不住要来对你说，要不，我一晚上也睡不着。”\n    她的一封黑眼睛直直的对我看着，小孩子一般天真的又说：\n    “我对你说，俺家那头毛驴子，是全村顶吃劲的一个，今黑夜，我操心喂上。你可好好歇息歇息吧！”\n    说完了话，她站起来就要走。我一把扯住了她的胳脯，不安的说：\n    “家里没有别的人能去了吗？一天叫你往返跑七八十里，怕累着你了呵！”\n    “看你说的那里话？别说家里根本没有人，就是有人，我明天也非去送你不行。这是个难得的机会，别的妇女听说都还眼红呢！谁不想去送送你？你在俺村住了月把，也知道，梁峪什么事也全凭俺们老婆们办。抬上担架，一走就是几十里，帮你赶赶牲口算个什？路上替你照照小慢慢（注）。赶黑就能返回来。”她瞪大了黑眼睛十分有理由的说。\n    我被她的亲切而刚毅的话感动了。我用手拨了拨她的包着白毛巾的头，诚恳的说：\n    “我是巴不得你们来送我呵！你最好能跟我在洪水住一晚上，第二天就返回来。我们多谈谈玩玩，你也可以游窜游窜。你回去跟家里商量商量，看怎么样？”\n    她十分同意我的这个提议。高兴得几乎连话都说不上来。停了一下，她用力握了握我的手，转身就跑了。她的短小的身材，如同每天清晨带领着青年妇女们跑步一样的轻捷，很快就闪出屋门去。她替我好好将门挂起后，又从门缝里轻声的说：\n    “明儿，我早早就准备停当了。”\n    如同喝了几杯浓热的酒，这妇女分队长的黑夜赶来，刺激得我无论如何也睡不着了。心中兴奋的在想着改梅，以及和改梅一样的梁峪村所有的妇女们。她们勤劳、刻苦、朴素的姿影，一连串的鲜明的记忆，都活动在我的眼前了。\n    记得，我初到村子的那一天，是刚刚过了元宵节，按乡村老百姓的习惯，还正是休息玩乐的好时候，我却看见不少的妇女们，提着筐子在到处拾粪，其中很多是白发苍苍的老太婆。看见她们的人，都用着同样尊重的声音鼓励着说：\n    “加油呵！劳动英雄！”\n    拾粪的妇女们，抬起头来笑笑，用着不好意思的神情摇摇手，又弯下腰紧张的工作起来。\n    走进村子里，一桩奇迹似的景象，映进了我的眼睛里。街道上看不见一个青年男人。活动在各处的，尽都是长胡须的老汉。上年纪的中年男人、妇女和小孩子们。很多妇女们，迈动着大脚板，挺着胸，快步的挑着大水桶来回走着。她们一走到我跟前，就放下水桶，像见了她们最熟悉的亲戚朋友一样，争抢着要我到她们家里去。\n    我拍着她们的硬棒棒的肩膀头赞扬的说：\n    “好本事呵！挑上这么大两桶水。”\n    “好同志，这是俺们地方老婆们普通的营生。谁也干得了。男人们都抗日走了，妇人们要吃饭，一样能受。”她们异口同声的回答。\n    当我生活在她们中间，渐渐和她们熟悉起来的时候，她们毫无顾忌的向我倾吐自己心底的话：她们的痛苦、快乐、和希望。这样，我也更具体更全面的了解了她们所经受的灾难，英勇的挣扎、翻身、进步，以及现在的民主自由的生活。这些充满着血泪，壮烈的、生动的、丰富的，故事一般的生活，留给我深厚的，难以泯灭的记忆。今夜，这记忆第一次夺去了我的睡眠。\n    我的耳朵边，清晰的萦绕着妇救秘书易生鱼时常对我讲的几句深刻的话：\n    “俺们妇女们，差不多个个都是抗动，还有不少光荣的寡妇和烈士的母亲。全村的生产和抗动工作，都全凭俺们担任，劳动互助组里，也是俺们成了中心。你想，全村八十六个能劳动的妇女，除了五六个年纪老和有残疾的外，全都参加了互助组。”\n    这些话和她们所做的一样，是光荣而值得骄傲的呵！在八年来残酷的对敌斗争里，她们这小小的八十几户人家的村庄里，竟送出了五十多个青年男人到了抗日的八路军，还有不少民兵，在保卫村庄的战斗里做了英勇壮烈的牺牲。这中间，妻子和母亲，动员和鼓励了她们的丈夫、儿子。送他们参了军，和她们并肩参战。当他们离开了村子以后，她们就挺起胸膛，担当起他们遗留下的一切工作，并且坚决的拒绝了维持敌人。我永远也不会忘记，她们每一个人曾经对我讲述过的，她们如何用钢铁的意志，粉碎了敌人对她们的恐吓和威胁。她们说：\n    “敌人一上来，俺们全村都跑到四下山里去了。不知道有多少回，狗日的在村子里，点着房子，伪军们吼叫着要俺们回去维持，俺们是早就下定了决心，全付烧光，俺们搬到山沟野地里住，也不回去。火烧得满天红，谁的心也没动过……等狗们回去了，我们钻进火堆里，扒扒扫扫又住下来，闹养种，纺花织布，该干什干什，到底狗日的也没奈何了俺梁峪老百姓！”\n    她们讲述着挨受的艰难困苦，忆念着自己死去或久别的亲人，心情却是开朗和愉快的。\n    杨来杰，这带着三个孩子，独立生活了五年的年轻而热情的寡妇，她自从在四一年五月的黑夜，亲手洗净和装殓了她那在暴风雨中，死在敌人枪弹中的民兵丈夫，又同着村人们一齐殡葬公祭以后，她揩干了眼泪，少吃没穿的在战争生活中，用自己的劳力，抚育着孤儿，再也没有哭泣过。在劳动互助组里面她顶上一个每天得十分的全劳动力，每年获得模范的光荣表扬。早几天在三八妇女节纪念会上，她从新学会的纪念歌上和主席的讲话里，了解了和平建设时期的妇女，是要更好的参加生产。于是，她在会上，除了热烈的向很多妇女提出劳动竞赛，还用发誓样的话来保证自己说：\n    “互助组在一搭，像一家人，组长就是咱们个当家的，我一切都受他的领导，服从他的分配，往后去，不管挑粪、耢地、溜籽垧、拔苗、割谷、打场、刨山药、我要比那一年都卖力气干，还打算学会织布，供上自己和孩子们穿衣服。”\n    烈士的母亲范三女，她的四个生着健壮体格，具有坚韧性格的孩子，两个牺牲了，一个失去了音信，另一个由于担任村政治主任的工作，在日夜忙碌中，三天两头有病。这位老太太，虽然是六十多岁的人，心中又负满伤痕，却对生活带着高度的热爱，对未来有着足够的信心和希望。在不休停的劳动中起劲得像年轻人一样。常常在深夜里，还听见她在黑暗中嗡嗡转动的纺车声，她细心的经管一群没有爸爸的孙儿，使媳妇们能够安心的在民学里学习文化。当养种最紧张的季节，她除了替在地里劳作的媳妇们做饭，和大的孙儿抬水外，还担当起照料牲口及家中一切工作。全村的人们都崇敬这位劳动的母亲。在这次纪念会上她又一次受到奖励以后，她像刚见我的时候一样说：\n    “儿子们个个都是很坚决，他们死得光荣。想起他们，我就是老了，能动弹一天就要动弹一天！”\n    只有这民主政权下真正得到解放的妇女们，才能用劳动的实际来纪念自己的有意义的节日。纪念会是开得又精悍又充实。大家不论是批评别人，检讨自己，订计划，提挑战，都是诚恳，认真，没有一句空话或一些脱离实际的幻想。她们对一个游手好闲而要提出和能受苦的男人离婚的女人，发出严格的尖锐的警告：\n    “在民学里，我们集体教育过她，妇救秘书，村长，谁都给她谈过，人不是块石头，总应该转变转变了！”\n    “她不能离婚，男人能受苦，就是个最好的条件！”\n    “回娘家躲也不行，娘家村里一样有民学，有互助组，给她写个转学证，到那一样得动弹，人住娘家，工作不能住娘家！”\n    在这样热烈而紧张的空气里，我却发现坐在前面炉火旁边的妇救常委李凤英，她一直沉默着，瘦瘦的脸孔低垂在胸前，如同有什么深的思虑，时而，她翻动着有些带着愧羞的眼睛，偷偷的看着我。这个表情给我的印象很深，好几次，她特意跑来看我，坐在我的炕边，就是用这样的目光看着我，张动着嘴巴想对我讲什么，却始终没有讲出来。\n    散会以后，我跟在拥挤的人们的后头，自动走到她的身边，轻轻的对她说：\n    “凤英，走，我上你家去玩玩！”\n    她使劲抓住我的手，表示着热挚的欢迎。我们就往后庄走去。\n    一片被敌人烧毁的残垣中间，有两间破旧的房子，她推开门和我走进去，让我坐在她那只放着一个薄薄的小被子的炕上。\n    “凤英，你有什么心思呢？怎呢老是不高兴？”我先开了口。\n    她凑近了我一些，不好意思的说：\n    “不是不高兴，我觉得太对不住工作呵。”\n    “有什么事，大家谈谈就完啦。”\n    “我早就想跟你话拢话拢……”她长长的叹了一口气。“是我自己经不住考验呵……”\n    我抚住她的有些抖颤的肩膀问：\n    “凤英，究竟是怎么一回事？”\n    她勉强的笑了笑说：\n    “我已经认识了自己的错误，也得到过别的姐妹们的劝说，现在也不怕你笑话了。”\n    她停了停，神态变得比较自然的接着说：\n    “男人参军以后，连一封信也没有，我孤伶伶的，拉把一个孩子，就在这个空房子里过了七年。生活比较困难，出去干工作闹生产时红红火火的，一回到家就觉得没办法，冷寂寂的。”她的眼圈儿发红了，她强抑着眼中晶莹泪珠。“去年，独立营在俺们这住，营长是个好人，常到俺们家照照，看见我困难，有时帮助俺挑些水，日子长了，俺两人就发生了感情，后来他提出要和我订婚。当时，我没有把这些事情对村上和妇救会秘书说。可是，后来自己仔细一想，觉得不应当这样办。伢走的时候，俺二人感情可好哩，他放心我在家里等他，才早早的就参军走啦。人家为国家为百姓在外面抗战，应该等着伢，听说，很多老干部，出来十几年也不能往家捎信。这样，我就把营长那方面回绝了。”\n    我安慰她说：\n    “事情这样处理很对吆！你心里还有什么不安呢？”\n    她低下了头，好半天才说：\n    “我是个生性要好的人，什么时候一想起这件事，心里就像结个疙疸，觉得自己给自己脸上抹了灰。再加上，我从妇救会成立，就担任着工作，我这回事，对抗属影响多不好呵！所以，精神上总不舒展。”\n    “我希望你愉快起来，你这就是经过了考验啦！又有了新的认识，往后去，更积极的去工作，在工作和劳动里，越发能锻炼我们妇女独立生活的勇气和能力！”\n    她轻松的笑了，心中如同卸去一个重负。这笑影今夜也浮在我的眼前了。在梁峪妇女里面，有不少这样具有对工作负责，知道珍惜真的感情，严肃的考虑生活问题，着想前途，和凤英一样令人敬爱的人呵！\n    想着这些从战斗和生产中锻炼出来的新型的劳动的妇女们，我很久没有睡。”\n     天快亮的时候，有人在院子里喊：\n     “招待所里准备接班呵！”\n    有人抢着答应了：\n    “今天如果有什么送彩号，支差，先尽俺们这没娃娃的去吧！”\n    “一样，地里也少不了人！”\n    不一会，一片歌声如同每天一样在村子里响起了：\n    ……\n    今年的三八节，大大不一般。\n     和平，建设，姐妹呀！增加生产！\n     新妇女能劳动，样样都要干，\n     吃饭，穿衣，姐妹呀，不依靠汉。\n     ……\n    接着毛驴的铃铛声，老牛的粗气声，加杂着妇女们的笑声，闹声，从我的临街的窗前流过，流到田野里去了。……\n    （注）：左权二区称呼小娃娃叫小慢慢。\n    三月二十日离梁峪前夜有感初稿。\n    四月十五日修改于韩壁。"

    "title": "Inaugural Statement",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-05-15",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Inaugural Statement\n\n　　This newspaper – People's Daily, the newspaper of the broad masses of people in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region – is published.\n\n　　The people, the Eighth Route Army, and the Communist Party in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region demonstrated boundless spirit of hardship, bravery and sacrifice in the eight years of driving out the Japanese invaders and saving the entire Chinese nation from peril. They shattered countless savage encroachments, offensives, and sweeps by the enemy and puppets over eight years, and persevered in the arduous war of resistance behind enemy lines. After the Japanese surrendered, in the five months of struggle to eliminate enemy puppets, halt the civil war, and strive for peace, the people, the Eighth Route Army, and the Communist Party of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu continued to demonstrate boundless spirit of hardship, bravery and sacrifice. They substantially eliminated enemy puppet remnants, expanded the territory of the liberated areas, severely struck blows against the reactionary civil war provocateurs who invaded the liberated areas, and cooperated with the nationwide struggle for peace and democracy, striving for the start of a national peaceful construction phase. The people of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region have made enormous contributions to the nation, to peace, and to democracy. The publication of this newspaper lies in carrying forward the traditional spirit of the people of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region in driving out the Japanese invaders, loving the nation, and loving peace and democracy.\n\n　　Currently, the people, the Eighth Route Army, and the Communist Party in Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu are continuing to deeply engage in the mass movements of anti-traitor accusations, grievance airing, and revenge seeking, as well as the rent reduction and interest rate reduction movement, deeply engaging in production and military training movements, carrying out rectification and demobilization, economic and cultural construction, and other aspects of work in order to consolidate domestic peace and adhere to the three major agreements of the Political Consultative Conference and the realization of all its resolutions. However, we feel that the victorious realization of the national cause of peace and democracy is an extraordinarily arduous project. The reactionary civil war provocateurs are brewing a nationwide civil war. The civil war in the Northeast is continuing to expand. The Kuomintang reactionary army surrounding the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army is attempting to encircle and annihilate the Fifth Division. The Kuomintang reactionary armies around our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu are also busy mobilizing and actively preparing for offensives. This means that civil war is threatening the national cause of peace and democracy, and is also threatening the work of peaceful and democratic construction in our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region. The publication of this newspaper will mobilize and organize the people of the entire Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region to rise up and adhere to the full realization of the PCC resolutions, adhere to mass self-defense struggles, especially strengthening the leadership and organization of mass self-defense warfare in border areas, preparing to crush the reactionaries' offensives at any time, and defend the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area.\n\n　　In order to implement the full realization of the PCC resolutions and further consolidate the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region is launching the anti-traitor accusations, grievance airing, and revenge seeking movement, and the rent reduction movement. This movement still needs to be further developed universally and deeply. Today, the main shortcomings are not being \"left,\" but not being bold and unfettered enough, but a few people's crude actions, and there are still many blanks, and a partial lack of attention to grasping the necessary policies towards middle peasants and others. The production movement is not deep in some areas, and must be checked in a timely manner to ensure its depth. Protecting the wheat harvest in the border areas, and the cultivation after the wheat harvest, should be prepared for immediately. The work of military training and rectification and demobilization is already underway in all troops, but this work must be closely integrated with the preparation for self-defense struggle. Naturally, we are unwilling to have a civil war and resolutely advocate peace, but once the civil war provocateurs force us to accept civil war, we can only rise up and resolutely defend ourselves, giving the reactionaries a resolute counterattack, and we must not relax our preparations for self-defense operations because of military training, rectification, and demobilization. Our democratic, economic, cultural, transportation, and other construction work, although already actively underway, we believe is not enough and needs to be further developed. Promoting these many aspects of work and seeking its further development and deepening, in order to achieve further consolidation of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, will be a very heavy task for the publication of this newspaper!\n\n　　Our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region's mountains and plains were once divided by the enemy for a long period, and the connection between the mountains and plains was greatly restricted. In the victorious march of eliminating the enemy puppets, the four regions, mountains and plains have been connected into one piece. Although the exchange and communication of experience have increased many conveniences in the future, however, due to the continuous blockade and division by the enemy puppets for seven or eight years in several regions, and the different conditions of the work foundation, environment, history, and experience in each region, there are still many differences in the work. How to more extensively, more fully, and more frequently exchange the experience of struggle and the experience of work in this region and that region, in the mountains and plains, in order to achieve more uniform steps in each region, more balanced development of work, and more concentrated forces, will also be a very important mission entrusted to this newspaper by the struggle!\n\n　　This newspaper – People's Daily, the newspaper of the broad masses of people in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region – is published under everyone's enthusiastic expectation and encouragement, and under extremely incomplete conditions. This is a thing worth celebrating!

They believe that the true content of this meeting not only completely violates the teachings of justice and reason, the party's program, and the current will of the people, but also the propositions of the majority of comrades in the party who are truly loyal to the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, they solemnly declare that Kuomintang members who are truly loyal to the Three Principles of the People not only disagree with the feudal, stubborn, small-organization monopoly of political power and the attempt to control party affairs at this meeting, but also oppose it; these are definitely not the propositions of true Kuomintang members. The document vehemently denounces the true intention of the fascist faction within the Kuomintang in initiating the reform movement, which is to further achieve their control over party affairs and to overturn the various resolutions of the PCC, especially the agreement on the draft constitution, in order to achieve their goal of continuing to monopolize political power. At the same time, they believe that the reason why the Kuomintang has become a bureaucratic political group, with \"the party separated from the people,\" \"members becoming bureaucrats,\" \"party headquarters becoming yamen,\" and \"the party becoming incapable of solving the people's problems,\" is because feudal, stubborn, small organizations are corrupting the party. They also believe that the election of Standing Committee members of the Kuomintang Second Plenary Session and representatives to the National Assembly is a set of false democratic methods, the result of which is that members of feudal, stubborn, small organizations have all been elected. Therefore, they advocate for the implementation of true democracy within and outside the party, which must first eliminate feudal, stubborn, small organizations, \"remove\" the \"bureaucratic party members\" in these small organizations, and \"remove\" their \"facts of controlling mass organizations at all levels and party affairs institutions at all levels, as well as monopolizing elections.\" The document solemnly expresses its support for the resolutions of the PCC, stating that the PCC agreement and the spirit of the party's program, the Five-Power Constitution, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings \"do not have fundamental conflicts\" and \"meet the needs of the people,\" and denounces the feudal, stubborn, small organizations of the Kuomintang Second Plenary Session for their conspiracy to undermine the PCC resolutions and revise the constitutional agreement as base and shameless.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    China\n延安    Yan'an\n重庆    Chongqing\n福建省  Fujian Province\n湖北省  Hubei Province\n\n中国国民党  Chinese Kuomintang (Guomindang)\n中国国民党民主同志联谊会  Democratic Comrades Association of the Chinese Kuomintang\n中国国民党福建省党务改革委员会  Fujian Provincial Party Affairs Reform Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang\n中国国民党湖北省党政改革委员会  Hubei Provincial Party and Government Reform Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang\n中国国民党新东政党务改革委员会  New East Political Party Affairs Reform Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang\n三民主义同盟联合会  Sanmin Zhuyi League Federation\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n\n三民主义  Sanmin Zhuyi (Three Principles of the People)\n政协  Political Consultative Conference (PCC)\n孙中山  Sun Yat-sen\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党内五团体  声明拥护政协决议  谴责二中全会反动决议案\n\n1946-05-15\n第3版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党内五团体\n    声明拥护政协决议\n    谴责二中全会反动决议案\n    【新华社延安十一日电】渝讯：国民党党内中国国民党民主同志联谊会、中国国民党福建省党务改革委员会、中国国民党湖北省党政改革委员会、中国国民党新东政党务改革委员会、三民主义同盟联合会等五团体，日前发表“我们对于本党二中全会的表示”一文件，声明反对二中全会决议及法西斯派的反动阴谋，并表示拥护政协决议。他们认为这次会议的真正内容，不但和事理遗教、该党政纲以及当前人民意志完全违背，而且和该党大多数真正忠实于三民主义的同志的主张也是违背的。因此，他们郑重声明，真正忠实于三民主义的国民党员，不但不同意这次会议的封建的顽固小组织垄断政权、包办党务的企图，并且是反对它的，这些决不是真的国民党员的主张。该文件痛斥国民党内法西斯派发起革新运动的真正企图，是想进一步的达到他们的包办党务，并希望推翻政协会议各项决议，特别是对于宪草的协议，达到他们继续垄断政权的目的。他们同时认为国民党之所以成为官僚的政治集团，“党民隔离”，“党员官僚化”，“党部衙门化”，“党成为不能解决人民问题之党”，就是因为封建顽固的小组织在腐蚀该党。并认为国民党二中全会中常委及国大代表的选举，是一套假民主的手法，其结果，就是封建顽固的小组织分子都当选了。因此他们主张要实行党内外的真正民主，首先必须革除封建顽固的小组织。“革除”这些小组织里面的“官僚党员”，并“革除”其“把持各级民众团体各级党务机构的事实，以及包办选举的事实”。该文件郑重表示拥护政协决议称：政协协议和该党政纲五权宪法精神及总理遗教“并没有基本的冲突”，“符合人民的要求”，并指斥该党二中全会封建顽固的小组织阴谋破坏政协决议、修改宪法协议，是卑劣无耻的。"

    "content": "Kuomintang Troops' Fierce Attack for 23 Days Unsuccessful\n    Democratic Allied Forces Firmly Defend Sipingjie\n    American and Chinese Newspapers Criticize the Kuomintang for Provoking Civil War\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Sipingjie, 11th] The Northeast Democratic Allied Forces have bravely defended Sipingjie, now entering its 23rd day. This strong democratic fortress, after a prolonged and fierce attack by the Kuomintang troops concentrating seven divisions, coupled with aerial bombardment, remains steadfastly unmoved. Currently, the Kuomintang troops attacking Sipingjie include the 38th, 30th, and 50th Divisions of the New 1st Army, the 77th and 91st Divisions of the 71st Army, and the 182nd Division of the 60th Army, and the 195th Division of the 52nd Army—a total of ten divisions. They have been concentrating bombardment on Sipingjie with intense firepower of 1,800 shells per hour, but our Democratic Allied Forces have consistently held their ground. The people of Sipingjie are full of confidence, saying, \"The Kuomintang can see the city, but they can't get in.\"\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th] In the Benxi area, the fighting continues on the south side of the Taizi River. The old city of Benxi is located on the north bank of the Taizi River, while the new city (Miyahara) is on the south bank. The entire city stretches approximately twenty li from north to south. After the 52nd Army and the 22nd Division of the New 6th Army occupied the old city of Benxi, they are now advancing south along the Anshan-Shenyang Railway and its west side toward the new city. The main force of the 14th Division of the New 6th Army is concentrated along the Guzi, Da'anping, and Tangheyan line southwest of Benxi, attacking toward the Zhongtou Station, twenty li south of the new city of Benxi. Our forces are currently putting up a stiff resistance in the vicinity of the new city of Benxi. The 88th Division of the 71st Army, which participated in the Benxi battles, has reportedly been transported north to the Kaiyuan area a few days ago. In the Sipingjie area, fierce fighting continues.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th] Moscow broadcasted today: Recently, many American and Chinese newspapers and radio stations have published commentaries on the current situation in China, unanimously pointing out the fact that the Chinese civil war has intensified again and demanding an unconditional cessation of the civil war. On April 30th, New York radio broadcasted: According to news from the Chinese government, the truce agreement with the Communists has been delayed because the Kuomintang army is attempting to occupy as many cities as possible in Manchuria. Associated Press correspondent Luo John in Nanjing reported on May 2nd: Military action has broken out again in Manchuria. This military action was provoked by the right-wing faction of the Kuomintang, who intend to create a favorable impression under the guise of clever propaganda and various rumors. Luo John pointed out that such propaganda is absurd. He also stated that if Chiang Kai-shek were to abolish the means of secret police and implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in Manchuria, harmony could be restored. The American magazine *Newsweek* published on May 1st an essay by journalist Shisikeling, who had recently returned from Manchuria, recounting his conversations with Kuomintang soldiers captured by the Communist army in Benxihu. The Kuomintang soldiers all unanimously stated that they were unwilling to wage war against their compatriots. They said that they had recently been transferred to Manchuria on American ships. The officers told them that they were being transferred to disarm the Japanese army, but they later learned from wounded soldiers returning from the front that they were being transferred to fight a civil war. The Shanghai *Cultural Daily* wrote on May 3rd: Unfortunately, after the Soviet army withdrew, a fratricidal war began in the Northeast. The newspaper pointed out: The United States has also joined this war. Chinese troops are using American ships, American cannons, and other weapons to slaughter the Chinese people. American ships are also transporting Chinese troops trained by Americans to various war zones. The newspaper continued: If the civil war in the Northeast does not stop immediately, it will have serious consequences and could turn into a nationwide civil war. The newspaper believes that only those who are short-sighted and simple-minded would say that the Kuomintang's reoccupation of Changchun is to save face, but the lives of the residents of the Northeast are much more important than so-called face. The newspaper concluded forcefully: We demand an unconditional cessation of the civil war.\n    The *Dagong Daily* of Beiping reports: The opinions of important figures in Shenyang and Jinzhou are that the Northeast issue must be resolved through political means, and it is impossible to resolve these issues through military force. Many American and Chinese newspapers have pointed out that the renewed outbreak of civil war in China is not limited to Manchuria. The American magazine *Newsweek* wrote on May 5th: After the signing of the truce agreement, the Kuomintang again launched attacks against the Communist army in the Hubei-Henan-Anhui border region. From January 10th to April 23rd, the Kuomintang launched 225 attacks in this region and is now intensifying its attacks. New York Post correspondent Barkan, stationed in the Liberated Areas, wrote: The New Fourth Army stationed in this area had intended to transfer to the Communist northern area, but the local residents pleaded with the New Fourth Army to stay until China had peace guarantees and residents could freely establish administrative organs before withdrawing.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国\tChina\n国民党\tKuomintang\n民主联军\tDemocratic Allied Forces\n四平街\tSipingjie\n新华社\tXinhua News Agency\n东北\tNortheast\n本溪\tBenxi\n太子河\tTaizi River\n宫原\tMiyahara\n五十二军\t52nd Army\n新六军\tNew 6th Army\n安沈铁路\tAnshan-Shenyang Railway\n孤家子\tGuzi\n大安平\tDa'anping\n汤河沿\tTangheyan\n终头车站\tZhongtou Station\n开原\tKaiyuan\n延安\tYan'an\n莫斯科\tMoscow\n纽约\tNew York\n共产党\tCommunist Party\n南京\tNanjing\n罗约翰\tLuo John\n蒋介石\tJiang Jieshi\n政协\tPolitical Consultative Conference\n什斯克林\tShisikeling\n本溪湖\tBenxihu\n上海文化日报\tShanghai Cultural Daily\n大公报\tDagong Daily\n北平\tBeiping\n沈阳\tShenyang\n锦州\tJinzhou\n鄂豫皖\tHubei-Henan-Anhui\n巴尔坎\tBarkan\n解放区\tLiberated Areas\n新四军\tNew Fourth Army\n新一军\tNew 1st Army\n七十一军\t71st Army\n六十军\t60th Army\n五十二军\t52nd Army\n长春\tChangchun\n美国\tUnited States\n苏联\tSoviet Union\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党军猛攻廿三天未逞  民主联军坚守四平街  中美报纸责国民党挑动内战\n\n1946-05-15\n第3版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党军猛攻廿三天未逞\n    民主联军坚守四平街\n    中美报纸责国民党挑动内战\n    【新华社四平街十一日电】东北民主联军英勇保卫四平街，现已推入第二十三天，此一坚强民主堡垒，经国民党军集中七个师长久猛攻及空中轰炸，依然屹立未动。现在国民党军进攻四平街之兵力，计有新一军之三十八师、三十师、五十师，七十一军之七十七师，九十一师，六十军之一八二师，五十二军之一九五师等十个师，以每小时一千八百发炮弹的炽烈火力，对四平街集中轰击，但我民主联军始终坚守阵地。四平街老百姓充满信心地说：“国民党看见城，但进不来。”\n    【新华社东北十日电】本溪方面，战事仍在太子河南继续进行中。本溪之旧城在太子河畔北面，其新城（宫原）在河南，全市南北长约二十里。五十二军及新六军第二十二师占领本溪旧城后，现沿安沈铁路及其西侧南犯新城，新六军第十四师主力结集在本溪西南之孤家子、大安平、汤河沿一线，向本溪新城南二十里终头车站方向进攻，我军正在本溪新城一带坚持抵抗。曾参加本溪战争之七十一军八十八师，闻已于日前北运开原一带。四平街方面，激战仍在继续中。\n    【新华社延安十日电】莫斯科今日广播：最近美国及中国的许多报纸及无线电，对中国现状纷纷发表评论，一致指出中国内战重新加剧的事实，并要求无条件停止内战。四月三十日纽约无线电广播：根据中国政府方面消息，说与共产党之停战协定已延迟，因为国民党军队正企图在满洲尽量多占些城市。美联社驻南京记者罗约翰五月二日电称：满洲又发生军事行动，这一军事行动，是国民党右派所挑起的，他们打算在巧妙的宣传与各种造谣掩蔽之下，造成一种有利的印象。罗约翰指出：这类宣传是荒谬无稽的。并称：蒋介石如果废除秘密警察手段，在满洲实现政协决议，则可以恢复协调一致。美每周新闻五月一日发表不久前自满洲返回旅社的记者什斯克林的论文，叙述他在本溪湖与被共产党军所俘获之国民党兵士谈话，国民党士兵都一致声明，他们不愿意进行反对自己同胞的战争。他们说：他们是在不久前乘美舰调到满洲来的，官长对他们说是调来解除日军武装，可是后来遇到自前线回来的伤兵，才知道是被调来打内战。上海文化日报五月三日写道：不幸在苏军抛退后，东北开始了自相惨杀的战争。该报指出：美国也加入了这一战争，中国军队乘美舰、使用美国大炮及其他武器屠杀中国人民，美舰并载运由美人训练的中国军队到各战区去。该报继指出：如果东北内战不立即停止，则将造成严重恶果，可以变成全国范围的内战。该报认为只有毫无远见和头脑简单的人，才会说国民党重新占领长春是保全自己的面子，可是东北居民的生活是比所谓面子更重要的多啦。该报结语力称：我们要求无条件停止内战。\n    大公报北平讯：沈阳、锦州东北要人的意见，均认为东北问题必须用政治方法解决，用武力解决这些问题，是不可能的。美国与中国的许多报纸，都指出中国重新发生内战，不仅限于满洲一地。美中国每周新闻五月五日写道：签订停战协定以后，国民党又重在鄂豫皖边区向中共军进攻，一月十日至四月二十三日，国民党对这一区域进攻了二二五次，现时正在加紧进攻中。纽约邮报驻解放区记者巴尔坎写道：驻在这一区域的新四军，曾想转过至共产党北方区域去，可是当地居民恳求新四军留下，等到中国有了和平保障，居民有可能自由建立行政机关时才撤走。"

    "content": "Kuomintang Troops Collude with Enemy and Puppet Forces, Loudly Proclaiming War Preparations\n    Massively Deploying and Repeatedly Invading Our Border Areas\n    Over Nine Hundred Attacks of Various Sizes in Three and a Half Months\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 11th] Taking advantage of the Eighth Route Army's faithful execution of the ceasefire order, the Kuomintang troops, colluding with enemy and puppet forces, loudly proclaimed \"Ceasefire is preparation for war,\" \"Reorganizing the army is building the army,\" and \"Demobilization is mobilization,\" and deployed large armies to attack the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region. The following is a detailed account of the Kuomintang army's movements and attacks from January 14th to the end of April:\n    (1) Deploying Troops and Expanding Fortifications. The newly deployed troops around the border region include the 55th Army, 38th Army, 88th Army, two divisions of the 1st Army, one independent brigade, 27th Army, two divisions each of the 68th Army and 90th Army, and five divisions from Yan Xishan's forces transferred from Datong, Taiyuan, and Xiaoyi: the 37th, 38th, 42nd, 70th, and 71st divisions, totaling twenty-three divisions and one independent brigade. Together with the two divisions of the 40th Army, 32nd Army, 85th Army, 30th Army, and Yan Xishan's 44th, 45th, 48th, 52nd, and 66th divisions, which were stationed around the border region before January 13th, the total comes to thirty-nine divisions and one independent brigade, not including the local Japanese and puppet troops. During the same period, the number of fortifications increased from over two hundred to eight hundred and forty-eight, more than two-thirds of which were built after Order No. 4 of the \"Peace\" charade.\n    (2) Military Offensives to Seize Positions. There were 927 attacks of various sizes on the border region, averaging more than eight per day, including four attacks involving more than 10,000 people, forty-two attacks involving more than 1,000 people, forty-five attacks involving more than 500 people, sixty-seven attacks involving more than 100 people, and the rest involving fewer than 100 people, using a total of no less than 600,000 troops. The following is a breakdown:\n    (A) Northern Henan Region: The Kuomintang 90th Army, long stationed in Luoyang, crossed north on January 14th and occupied more than thirty villages and towns in Meng County, including Botou, Shunjian, and Yejiong, establishing bridgehead fortresses in an attempt to coordinate with the Kuomintang forces in Wuzhi and Huojia to attack, open the Daokou-Qinghua Railway, and seize Bo'ai, Qinyang, and Jiaozuo. Kuomintang troops on the Pinghan Railway occupied Balizhuang in Anyang, Dongwanghe, Baogongmiao, and Luohekou in Huixian, Zuo Village, Manliu, and East and West Simen in Jixian, and Guanjia Kiln, Wujiawo, Zhangjiao, Pangjiawo, and Dongzi in Tangyin, attempting to confine the Eighth Route Army to the mountains and use it as an advanced position for attacking north along the Pinghan Railway. (B) Eastern Henan Region: The Kuomintang mobilized nine divisions, totaling more than 90,000 troops, and launched more than eighty attacks of various sizes. At the Xinxiang meeting on April 10th, the Kuomintang reactionaries openly denied the existence of the Eastern Henan Liberated Area, making the situation in the area grave. (C) Northern Longhai Railway Region: The 55th Army, originally in Eastern Henan, illegally entered the Ji-Lu-Yu region in mid-March and successively occupied Sanchunji in Kaocheng, Guozhuang in Changyuan, and Gegang in Dongming. At the meeting, they further demanded the opening of the corridor from Kaocheng to Dongming, attempting to link the anti-communist strongholds in southern Ji-Lu-Yu into one piece as an advance base for attack. In the Western Shandong-Northern Jiangsu region, in late April, the Kuomintang army, with more than 5,000 troops and four aircraft, attacked the Shicheng and Caolou areas, and once occupied the Caolou position. Currently, the fighting in the area has not yet ceased. (D) Along the Baijin Railway: Before the ceasefire order, there was not a single soldier of Yan Xishan's army in this area. On February 4th and March 8th, Yan's side twice mobilized large armies, combining with the 14th Brigade of the Japanese army, totaling more than 20,000 troops, to attack along the Baijin Railway, attempting to seize Shangdang. The Eighth Route Army was forced to defend itself, and Yan's army failed in both incursions. (E) Southern Shanxi Region: Yan's army and the Kuomintang army launched 467 attacks, using 99,700 troops. The Eighth Route Army suffered 243 casualties below the regimental commander level, and occupied dozens of villages and towns in the liberated areas, including Sandu Village and Ma Village in Pinglu, Congshan Village and Lujiazhuang in Anyi, Lishuling, Liuhe Village, and Beiren Village in Jishan, and Dongma Village in Jiang County.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n晋冀鲁豫边区  Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Bianqu (Jin-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region)\n第五十五军    Di Wushiwu Jun (55th Army)\n第三十八军    Di Sanshiba Jun (38th Army)\n第八十八军    Di Babashi Jun (88th Army)\n第一军        Di Yi Jun (1st Army)\n第二十七军    Di Ershiqi Jun (27th Army)\n第六十八军    Di Liushiba Jun (68th Army)\n第九十军    Di Jiushi Jun (90th Army)\n阎锡山     Yan Xishan\n第三十七师   Di Sanshiqishi (37th Division)\n第三十八师   Di Sanshibashi (38th Division)\n第四十二师   Di Sizhishi'er Shi (42nd Division)\n第七十师     Di Qishishi (70th Division)\n第七十一师   Di Qishiyi Shi (71st Division)\n第四十军     Di Sishi Jun (40th Army)\n第三十二军   Di Sanshier Jun (32nd Army)\n第八十五军   Di Bashiwu Jun (85th Army)\n第三十军     Di Sanshi Jun (30th Army)\n第四十四师   Di Sisishisi Shi (44th Division)\n第四十五师   Di Sisishiwu Shi (45th Division)\n第四十八师   Di Sisibashi Shi (48th Division)\n第五十二师   Di Wushishi'er Shi (52nd Division)\n第六十六师   Di Liushiliushi Shi (66th Division)\n孟县   Meng Xian (Meng County)\n波头   Botou\n顺涧   Shunjian\n冶戎   Yejiong\n武陟   Wuzhi\n获嘉   Huojia\n道清线   Daokou-Qinghua Railway\n博爱   Bo'ai\n沁阳   Qinyang\n焦作   Jiaozuo\n平汉路   Pinghan Railway\n安阳   Anyang\n八里庄   Balizhuang\n辉县   Huixian\n东王河   Dongwanghe\n包公庙   Baogongmiao\n洛河口   Luohekou\n汲县   Jixian\n左庄   Zuo Village\n漫流   Manliu\n东西寺门   East and West Simen\n汤阴   Tangyin\n关家窑   Guanjia Kiln\n吴家凹   Wujiawo\n张角   Zhangjiao\n庞家凹   Pangjiawo\n东子   Dongzi\n洛阳   Luoyang\n新乡   Xinxiang\n豫东解放区   Yudong Jiefangqu (Eastern Henan Liberated Area)\n陇海路   Longhai Railway\n冀鲁豫地区   Ji-Lu-Yu Diqu (Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region)\n考城   Kaocheng\n三春集   Sanchunji\n长垣   Changyuan\n郭庄   Guozhuang\n东明   Dongming\n葛岗   Gegang\n鲁西苏北地区   Lu Xi Su Bei Diqu (Western Shandong-Northern Jiangsu region)\n石城   Shicheng\n草楼   Caolou\n白晋沿线   Baijin Yanxian (Along the Baijin Railway)\n上党   Shangdang\n晋南地区   Jinnan Diqu (Southern Shanxi Region)\n平陆   Pinglu\n三杜村   Sandu Village\n马村   Ma Village\n安邑   Anyi\n从善村   Congshan Village\n芦家庄   Lujiazhuang\n稷山   Jishan\n李树岭   Lishuling\n刘和村   Liuhe Village\n北仁村   Beiren Village\n绛县   Jiang Xian\n东马村   Dongma Village\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党军结合敌伪高唱备战  大举调动屡犯我边区  三个半月大小进攻九百余次\n\n1946-05-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党军结合敌伪高唱备战\n    大举调动屡犯我边区\n    三个半月大小进攻九百余次\n    【新华社邯郸十一日电】国民党军结合敌伪军，高唱“停战就是备战”，“整军就是建军”，“复员就是动员”，乘八路军忠实执行停战命令时机，纷纷调动大军，向晋冀鲁豫边区进攻。现将一月十四日至四月底国方军队调动及进攻情形，分述如下：\n    （一）调动军队增修碉堡。新调边区周围部队，计有五五军、三八军、八八军、第一军之两个师、一个独立旅、二七军、六八军九十军各两个师、及由大同、太原、孝义增来之阎锡山军三十七、三十八、四十二、七十、七十一等五个师，共计二十三个师，一个独立旅，连一月十三日前原驻边区周围的四十军两个师、三十二军、八十五军、三十军、及阎锡山之四四、四五、四八、五二、六十六等师，共计三十九个师，一个独立旅，当地日伪军尚不在内。同期内碉堡由二百余个增修至八百四十八个，其中三分之二以上是在和字第四号命令后修筑的。\n    （二）军事进攻夺取阵地。对边区大小进攻九二七次，每日平均八次以上，其中万人以上进攻四次，千人以上四十二次，五百人以上四十五次，百人以上六十七次，余为百人以下的进攻，使用兵力不下六十万人。兹分述如下：\n    （甲）豫北地区：久驻洛阳之国民党九十军，于一月十四日北渡占我孟县之波头、顺涧、冶戎等三十余村镇，建立桥头堡垒，企图将来配合武陟、获嘉国民党军进攻，打通道清线，夺取博爱、沁阳及焦作。平汉路上国民党军，占我安阳之八里庄、辉县之东王河、包公庙、洛河口，汲县之左庄、漫流、东西寺门，汤阴之关家窑、吴家凹、张角、庞家凹、东子等地，企图将八路军封锁于山地，作为向平汉路北攻的前进阵地。（乙）豫东地区：国民党调集九师之众，共九万余人，大小进攻八十余次。四月十日新乡会议上，国民党反动派更公开否认豫东解放区的存在，该地形势严重。（丙）陇海路北地区：原在豫东之五五军，于三月中旬非法开入冀鲁豫地区，先后占我考城之三春集，长垣之郭庄，东明之葛岗。会议上更提出开放考城至东明走廊的要求，企图将冀鲁豫南部反共据点连成一片，作为进攻时的前进基地。鲁西苏北地区，四月下旬，国民党军以五千余人，飞机四架，向我石城、草楼一带进攻，并一度占我草楼阵地。目前该地战事仍未停止。（丁）白晋沿线：停战令前，此地区无阎军一兵一卒，二月四日与三月八日阎方两次调集大军，结合日军十四旅团，共二万余人，向白晋沿线进攻，企图夺取上党。八路军被迫自卫，阎军两次进犯均未得逞。（戊）晋南地区：阎军及国民党军进攻四六七次，使用兵力九万九千七百余人，八路军伤亡团长以下官兵二百四十三人，侵占解放区平陆之三杜村、马村，安邑之从善村、芦家庄，稷山之李树岭、刘和村、北仁村，绛县之东马村等数十村镇。"

On the 3rd of this month, 150,000 people in Linze County held meetings in different districts. The masses competed to speak. Mr. Zhao Zhongkai, a landlord from Liuzhuang, said angrily: \"For twenty years, the Kuomintang has managed the Yellow River in such a way that floods are everywhere, and the people have lost countless lives and property. Now they want to use 'river management' as a pretext to only close the breach without restoring the dikes, flooding the people, and coordinating with their civil war conspiracy. We swear to oppose it!\" At the mass meeting in the Fifth District, 16,000 people attending signed a protest letter, severely warning the Kuomintang authorities to immediately abandon their conspiracy that disregards the lives of the people and implement the Heze Agreement. If the people are forced to do so, they will resolutely rise up in self-defense. Moreover, the masses in 970 villages in ten counties, including Pingyin, in the First District of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, are urgently holding meetings these days. In addition to issuing appeals to compatriots across the country, they are also actively preparing for effective self-defense.\n    [Xinhua News Agency Jinji-Luyu General Branch, Handan News] The Jinji-Luyu Border Region Assembly and the Border Region Government jointly sent a telegram to the National Water Conservancy Commission in Nanjing on the 10th of this month, requesting that the original proposal to complete the Yellow River breach closure project in two years be adhered to. The telegram stated: The Yellow River diversion is not simply a construction and river management issue, but a military issue involving the conspiracy and sabotage of the reactionaries. If the absurd theory of closing the breach within two months is not thoroughly corrected, the people of our border region will have no choice but to rise up in self-defense and wage a resolute struggle against the conspirators. It is hoped that your committee will respect the facts, uphold justice, and adhere to the original proposal to complete the breach closure work in two years. On the same day, another telegram was sent to the Shanghai United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, expressing firm opposition to the conspiracy of the Kuomintang authorities to undermine the Heze River management agreement, and hoping that Mr. Todd, the American Chief Engineer of the Administration and the Yellow River Commission, would stop his absurd assertion that \"the breach must be closed within two months.\"\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    China\n国民党  Guomindang\n冀鲁豫区   Ji-Lu-Yu Qu (Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region)\n临泽县    Linze Xian (Linze County)\n刘庄    Liuzhuang\n赵仲凯    Zhao Zhongkai\n平阴    Pingyin\n晋冀鲁豫边区   Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Bianqu (Jinji-Luyu Border Region)\n南京    Nanjing\n全国水利委员会   Quanguo Shuili Weiyuanhui (National Water Conservancy Commission)\n联合国善后救济总署   Lianheguo Shanhòu Jiuji Zongshu (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration)\n上海    Shanghai\n塔得   Tade (Todd)\n荷泽协议  Heze Xieyi (Heze Agreement)\n花园口  Huayankou (Garden Breach)\n黄河    Huang He (Yellow River)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党固执花园堵口合龙  冀鲁豫人民群起抗议\n\n1946-05-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党固执花园堵口合龙\n    冀鲁豫人民群起抗议\n    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社荷泽讯】国民党当局破坏荷泽协议，固执其两月堵口阴谋的消息传出后，冀鲁豫区沿河十八县数百万群众，愤激万分，纷起集会，示威抗议，并向全国控诉，吁请火速制止法西斯派此种史无先例的罪恶阴谋。本月三日，临泽全县十五万群众分区集会，群众争相发言，刘庄地主赵仲凯先生愤激的说：“二十年来国民党治河治得大水遍地，人民丧失了无数的生命财产，他们现在又想借‘治河’为名，只堵口不复堤，放水淹人，配合其内战阴谋，我们誓死反对！”五区群众大会上，一万六千到会群众，全体签署抗议书，严重警告国民党当局，立即放弃不顾民命的阴谋，执行荷泽协议，人民迫不得已，必奋起自卫。又冀鲁豫一分区平阴等十个县九百七十个村庄群众，连日正紧急集会，除向全国同胞发出呼吁外，并积极准备作有效之自卫。\n    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社邯郸讯】晋冀鲁豫边区参议会、边区政府于本月十日特联名致电南京全国水利委员会，请坚持二年完成黄河堵复工作之原议。电称：黄河改道，不是单纯的建设治河问题，而是包含着反动派阴谋破坏的军事问题。对两月内堵口之谬论如不彻底纠正，我边区人民只有奋起自卫，与阴谋者作坚决斗争。希望贵会尊重事实，坚持正义，坚持二年完成堵复工作之原议。同日，又致电上海联合国善后救济总署，表示坚决反对国民党当局破坏荷泽治河协议之阴谋，并希该署总工程师兼黄委会美籍塔得先生，停止其“两月必须堵口”的荒谬主张。"

    "content": "Kuomintang Authorities Sabotage the Heze Agreement\n    Deliberately Release Water to Flood Our Liberated Areas\n    Disregarding the Lives of Seven Million People to Achieve Internal War Conspiracy\n    Spokesperson of the CPC Central Committee Expresses Firm Opposition\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th] Our reporter recently interviewed a spokesperson of the CPC Central Committee regarding the sabotage of the Heze River Management Agreement by the Kuomintang authorities and their conspiracy to drown seven million compatriots in the old course of the Yellow River in the three provinces of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong. The spokesperson's remarks are as follows:\n    Question: What is the history of the Yellow River issue?\n    Answer: The Yellow River originally flowed through northern Henan, southern Hebei, diagonally across Shandong to Lijin and into the sea. In the summer of 1938, the Kuomintang authorities dispatched troops to breach the dikes at Huayuankou in Zhongmou County, between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng in Henan, in an attempt to halt the enemy's advance. Since then, the Yellow River has flowed southeast from Huayuankou to the border of Henan and Anhui, entering the Huai River, then the Grand Canal, and the Yangtze River into the sea. The result of the Yellow River breach has been detrimental in every way. Furthermore, the Kuomintang authorities kept the people in the dark beforehand, causing countless compatriots' lives and property to suffer tragically in the areas through which the Yellow River flowed, making it one of the most painful pages in the history of the War of Resistance. The waterways of the Huai River and the Grand Canal have also been affected, with the riverbeds at risk of silting up year by year. Now that the War of Resistance has ended, it is, in principle, feasible to dredge the Yellow River with sufficient manpower, material resources, and foreign aid, so that it returns to its old course. Although this will bring some disasters to the people in the liberated areas of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, for the benefit of a greater number of people, the people and the CPC in the liberated areas of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan support this move and are willing to actively participate in this work. However, the old course of the Yellow River downstream has long suffered from many problems. After eight years of diversion, the riverbed is now more than one zhang above ground level, like a rooftop. The newly built villages and towns on it have reached 1,700, so the so-called river course already exists in name only. The old dikes along the entire two thousand li of the bank have also been severely damaged. The section from Puxian to Shouzhang on the north bank after entering Shandong is particularly damaged. East of Jinan, there are more dangerous works that urgently need repair. This project is very large and definitely cannot be completed in a few months. Our liberated areas have suffered eight years of War of Resistance and three years of famine, and it is even less possible to independently complete this project. If the above-mentioned problems are intentionally ignored, and the new course at Huayuankou is closed within a limited time, then the catastrophe of the Yellow River overflowing will be even more unimaginable and unforgivable than the previous disaster eight years ago. In March of this year, our Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government, in view of the lives of the people in the three provinces of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong, specially sent representatives Jia Xinzhai and Zhao Mingfu to Kaifeng to study proper solutions with the responsible authorities of the Kuomintang government. They also went to both banks of the old course of the Yellow River with Zhao Shouyu, Chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, to inspect and witness the above-mentioned facts. As a result, on April 15th, an agreement was jointly established in Heze City, southwestern Shandong. The main points are as follows: (1) The old course should be dredged and the dikes restored first, and then the breach at Huayuankou should be closed and water released. (2) The relocation costs for villages and towns in the river course have been determined according to the estimated standards, and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission will submit them to the Executive Yuan of the National Government for allocation. (3) The construction organization will be jointly formed by personnel from both sides. (4) Gradually restore the relevant transportation, but ensure that it is not used for military purposes. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and impartial experts all agreed to this reasonable solution and decided to complete the work of returning the Yellow River to its old course within two years. However, some Kuomintang authorities ignored this fair and reasonable agreement and forced the commission to complete the Huayuankou closure project within two months. For the aftermath of the old course, they proposed a perfunctory solution of increasing the old dikes by five gongcun. Therefore, the Heze Agreement has not been implemented to this day, and the Huayuankou closure project has been actively underway. According to Zhao Mingfu, a representative of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government who personally inspected Huayuankou, the earthworks at both the east and west ends of the 1,500-meter-long breach have been completed, leaving only a 500-meter-wide water flow. The Kuomintang authorities are now mobilizing 17,000 laborers, 22 trucks, and have repaired light railways to transport materials in order to rush to close the gap in the shortest possible time and release water to flow eastward, turning most of southern Hebei and Shandong into a swamp. In addition, it is heard that some figures within the Kuomintang also plan to divert water into the Wei River in Wuzhi, northern Henan, so that it will meet the Grand Canal in northwestern Shandong and flow north to Hebei and into the sea, then the plains along the Wei River and the Grand Canal will be completely submerged.\n    Question: What are the CPC's views on this issue?\n    Answer: The CPC believes that the principle of dredging the river and restoring the dikes before closing the breach and releasing water in the Heze Agreement is completely fair, reasonable, and practical, and has been praised by many responsible river management personnel. There is really no reason to oppose it. The CPC hopes that the Kuomintang authorities can abide by this agreement, quickly help the liberated areas of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan to dredge the river and restore the dikes, and relocate more than 700,000 residents in the old course of the Yellow River, so that the project of returning the Yellow River to its old course can be successfully completed. In this regard, the CPC and the people in the liberated areas will fully cooperate. However, now some Kuomintang authorities are violating the principle of dredging the river and restoring the dikes before closing the breach without any reason, refusing to take any responsibility for relocating and relieving the residents of the old course, and insisting on closing the breach and releasing water at Huayuankou within two months. Then the CPC cannot but believe that this is a pretext of river management to deliberately drown compatriots in the three provinces of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong, and this is inseparable from the current internal war conspiracy of the national reactionaries! The CPC cannot turn a blind eye to the life and death of thousands upon thousands of people, and cannot but express its firm opposition to the vicious plan of the Kuomintang reactionaries to sacrifice the lives and property of millions of people! Now the representatives of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government have lodged a protest with the Kuomintang authorities in Kaifeng, and the CPC representatives stationed in Nanjing will also lodge the same protest with the relevant authorities, demanding that the implementation of this conspiracy be stopped. It is also declared that if the Kuomintang authorities insist on going their own way and disregarding the lives of the people, then the people in the liberated areas of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan who are directly affected will be forced to take necessary self-defense measures for survival, and the Kuomintang authorities shall bear full responsibility for the consequences. We hope that people from all walks of life at home and abroad, especially those concerned, can uphold humanitarian justice and strive to stop the Huayuankou closure project before the work of changing the course of the river, dredging the dikes, and relocating and relieving residents is completed, so as to save millions or even tens of millions of people along the Yellow River in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan from death.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国共产党中央委员会    Zhongguo Gongchandang Zhongyang Weiyuanhui (CPC Central Committee)\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n延安    Yan'an\n荷泽治河协议  Heze River Management Agreement\n黄河    Huang He (Yellow River)\n豫冀鲁  Yu Ji Lu (Henan, Hebei, Shandong)\n晋冀鲁豫边区政府  Jin Ji Lu Yu Bianqu Zhengfu (Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government)\n贾心斋  Jia Xinzhai\n赵明甫  Zhao Mingfu\n开封    Kaifeng\n国民党政府  Guomindang Zhengfu (Kuomintang Government)\n黄河水利委员会  Huang He Shui Li Weiyuanhui (Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission)\n赵守钰  Zhao Shouyu\n鲁西南  Lu Xinan (Southwestern Shandong)\n行政院  Xingzheng Yuan (Executive Yuan)\n花园口堵口工程  Huayuankou Dukou Gongcheng (Huayuankou Closure Project)\n武陟    Wuzhi\n卫河    Wei He (Wei River)\n南京    Nanjing\n国民党    Guomindang (Kuomintang)\n利津    Lijin\n中牟    Zhongmou\n郑州    Zhengzhou\n淮河    Huai He (Huai River)\n运河    Yun He (Grand Canal)\n长江    Chang Jiang (Yangtze River)\n濮县    Puxian\n寿张    Shouzhang\n济南    Jinan\n冀南    Ji Nan (Southern Hebei)\n濮县至寿张  Puxian Zhi Shouzhang\n河北    Hebei\n河南省    Henan Sheng (Henan Province)\n山东省    Shandong Sheng (Shandong Province)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党当局破坏荷泽协议  蓄意放水淹我解放区  不顾七百万人民生命图逞内战阴谋  中共中央发言人表示坚决反对\n\n1946-05-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党当局破坏荷泽协议\n    蓄意放水淹我解放区\n    不顾七百万人民生命图逞内战阴谋\n    中共中央发言人表示坚决反对\n    【新华社延安十日电】记者顷以国民党当局破坏荷泽治河协议，阴谋淹毙黄河故道豫冀鲁三省七百万同胞事，访问中共中央发言人发言人谈话如次：\n    问：黄河问题的经过如何？\n    答：黄河原经豫北冀南斜贯山东至利津入海。民国二十七年夏，始由国民党当局，派军队在河南郑州开封间中牟县境之花园口实行决堤，图以此阻止敌人的进攻，自此黄河乃由花园口东南，流至豫皖边，入淮河，转运河、长江入海。黄河决口的结果，有百害而无一利。加以国民党当局事前对人民保守秘密，致黄河所经之地，无数同胞之生命财产，惨遭损失，为抗战史中极惨痛之一页。而淮河运河的水道，亦因而遭受影响，河床有逐年淤浅之虞。现抗战结束，以充分人力物力与友邦援助，疏导黄河，使复归故道，原则上是可行的，虽然这对冀鲁豫与山东解放区人民，会带来一些灾难，但为了更多数人民的利益，冀鲁豫与山东解放区人民及中共，是赞成此举，并愿积极参加此项工作的。然而黄河下游的故道，素有很多积弊，经改道八年后，河床竟高出地面一丈以上，势如屋脊，其上新建之村镇，已达一千七百个，故所谓河道早已名存实亡。全岸二千余里的旧堤坝，现亦已破败不堪，入鲁后，北岸濮县至寿张之段，败坏特甚。济南以东，更多险工，亟待修补，此项工程，甚为浩大，决非几个月所能办到者。我解放区经八年抗战，三年灾荒，更决无独立完成此项工程之可能，如有意置上述问题于不顾，限期将花园口之新道堵塞，则黄水横流之惨祸，必较八年前之覆辙尤为不堪设想与不可宽恕。今年三月我晋冀鲁豫边区政府，鉴于豫冀鲁三省民命所关，特派代表贾心斋、赵明甫前往开封，与国民党政府主管机关研究妥善办法，并与黄河水利委员会委员长赵守钰氏亲赴黄河故道两岸勘察，目睹上述实情，因于四月十五日在鲁西南荷泽市共同成立协议，要点如下：（１）故道先行浚河复堤，然后再在花园口实行堵口放水；（２）河道内村镇之迁移费已确定概算标准，由黄河水利委员会转呈国民政府行政院拨发；（３）施工机构由双方派人合组；（４）逐步修复有关之交通，但保证不作军用。黄河水利委员会及公正专家，均同意此种合乎情理的办法，并决定在两年内赶完进黄归故的工作。乃国民党某些当局，却不顾这一公平合理的协定，迫令该会于两个月内完成花园口堵口工程，对于故道善后，则提出旧堤加高五公寸的搪塞敷衍办法，因此荷泽协定迄今未付执行，而花园口堵口工程，反已积极进行。据晋冀鲁豫边区政府代表赵明甫亲往花园口视察，发现全长一千五百公尺之决口，东西两端土工业已完成，只剩宽五百公尺之水流，国民党当局现正动员民夫一万七千人，卡车二十二辆，并修好轻便铁道运输器材，以便赶于最短期内，实行合龙，放水东流，使冀南与山东大部化为泽国。此外又闻国民党内某些人物，还打算在豫北武陟地方导通水入卫河、使于鲁西北会运河北流至河北入海，则卫河，运河沿岸平原，更将全部淹没。\n    问：中共对这个问题的意见如向？\n    答：中共认为荷泽协定中先浚河复堤后堵口放水的原则，完全公正合理，切实易行，且已得到很多负责治河人士的赞许，实在没有任何理由加以反对。中共希望国民党当局，能够信守这一协定，迅速帮助冀鲁豫与山东解放区浚河复堤，与迁徙黄河故道七余万居民，使黄河归故工程，得以顺利完成，在这一方面，中共与解放区人民，必将充分协力合作；但是现在国民党某些当局，却毫无理由地违反先浚河复堤后堵口，对迁徙救济故道居民不负任何责任，并坚持两个月内先在花园口实行合龙放水，那么中共不能不认为这是借治河为名，蓄意淹毙豫冀鲁三省同胞，而这是与当前全国反动派的内战阴谋分不开的！中共对千千万万人民生死存亡，决不能熟视无睹，对于国民党反动派，以千百万人民的生命财产为牺牲品的恶毒计划，不能不表示坚决的反对！现在晋冀鲁豫边区政府代表，已向开封国民党当局提出抗议，中共驻南京的代表，亦将向有关当局提出同一抗议，要求制止这一阴谋的实现。并声明：如果国民党当局一意孤行，不顾民命，则适当其冲的冀鲁豫解放区人民，为了生存，将被迫采取必要的自卫措施，其后果应由国民党当局负其全责。我们希望国内外各方人士尤其是有关人士，能够主持人道正义，在改道浚河复堤与居民迁徙救济工作完毕以前，努力制止花园口堵口工程，以挽救冀鲁豫沿河数百万乃至数千万人民免于死亡。"

Although there was no final agreement, they have reached \"close to an agreement in principle\" (Associated Press). Regarding the issue of Italian colonies, the Soviet Union made a concession and suggested, with certain reservations, agreeing to the French plan, namely, letting Italy administer under the supervision of the United Nations. Bevin declared that Britain was willing to abandon its plan for \"immediate independence\" of Benghazi, Tripolitania, and Cyrenaica. Benes expressed that the U.S. military was willing to request overall trusteeship, but believed that the final result of the French proposal could almost avoid the infighting among the great powers. Regarding the issue of reparations, France suggested accepting the Soviet demand of $1.2 billion, but the total amount of compensation would be determined after the investigation of Italian assets. Benes demanded that this compensation should not be paid in cash, but in military industries, equipment, foreign assets, and shipping. The Soviet Union also made concessions on the issue of dealing with war criminals, and in principle accepted the American suggestion regarding the war crimes committee. As for the key issue of the peace treaty—the Trieste issue—it remains at a standstill. Reuters reported: \"Soviet sources in Paris insist that the Soviet Union made all the concessions at the meeting, but received no rewards.\"\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n巴黎四强外长会议\tParis Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference\n对意和约\t\tItalian Peace Treaty\n新华社\t\tXinhua News Agency\n延安\t\tYan'an\n贝文\t\tBevin\n的黎波里\tTripolitania\n坦尼亚\t\tBenghazi\n昔兰尼加\tCyrenaica\n贝纳斯\t\tBenes\n的里雅斯特\tTrieste\n路透社\t \tReuters\n联合国\t\tUnited Nations\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 巴黎四强外长会议  对意和约获原则协议\n\n1946-05-15\n第3版()\n专栏：\n\n　　巴黎四强外长会议\n    对意和约获原则协议\n    【新华社延安十二日电】巴黎讯：四强外长十日下午的三小时秘密会议上，绕过了关于召开和会日期之争论，而在对意和约中三个麻烦问题上，“突然打破长期的僵局”，虽然无何最后协议，但已达到“接近于原则上的协议”（合众社）。关于意殖民地问题，苏联提出让步，建议在某些保留条件下，同意法国之计划，即在联合国监督下，由意任管。贝文宣称：英愿放弃便的黎波里、坦尼亚与昔兰尼加“立即独立”的计划，贝纳斯则表示美军愿要求整体托管制，但认为法国建议之最后结果，可使大强国间之倾轧几近于避免。关于赔款问题，法国建议接受苏方之一二美元要求，但赔偿总数则留待至意大利资产调查后决定。贝纳斯要求此项赔款，不以现金，而以军用工业、装备、国外资产及航运偿付。苏联在处置战犯问题上，也作了让步，在原则上接受了美国关于战犯委员会的建议。至于对待和约之关键问题——的里雅斯特问题，则仍在僵持中。路透社电称：“巴黎苏方人士坚称，苏联在会议上做了一切让步，但并未获得任何报酬”。"

    "date": "1946-05-15",
    "page_number": "4",
    "content": "Hitler-style \"Neurosis\"\n    I remember that at the beginning of the Second European War, before Hitler advanced into any country, he would invariably give a speech: saying how his \"sacred\" Germanic nation had been insulted and slaughtered there, which he could not bear, and he vowed to eliminate these \"bandits\"... Then the cannons roared, tanks and planes poured in, hanging the corpses of anti-fascist people all over the lampposts on the streets!\n    This cruel massacre by Hitler shocked the so-called civilized Europeans and Americans; therefore, for a time, many articles by reporters appeared, using various materials to prove that Hitler was \"neurotic.\" It seemed that without this, it would be impossible to understand this executioner who used all his strength in the twentieth century to carry out human genocide! Later, it seemed that no conclusion was reached.\n    Looking back at China, this point is still very advanced; no one has yet come out to shout that our Chinese-style fascist bosses are also neurotic. Although this secret service chief, since betraying the revolution and slaughtering the people, his methods and records are no less than those of his ancestors, and even surpass them.\n    However, he wears a long robe and a cloak, originally a \"Sino-Western\" antique, taking the opportunity of the War of Resistance, he unexpectedly achieved victory, which added some luster to his appearance. He is also a lackey, so he will not offend the foreign masters – as for domestic affairs, China has a vast land and a large population, and it is not surprising that some old people die. Therefore, foreign journalists have not bothered to study whether he also has a nervous breakdown.\n    We know that he is not neurotic.\n    Looking back a long way, this secret service chief used to use words like \"supreme\" and \"sacred\" to give a speech, and then there would be a bloody battle, slaughtering tens of millions of people. Looking at the recent past, he just declared that he would implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and implement democracy, and immediately called on the whole country to fight each other, from the accompanying capital to the capital, to the ancient capital, to Shanghai, Guangzhou... For the unarmed people, there was a murderous aura! Beating Political Consultative Conference representatives, beating newspaper offices, beating schools; students beat students, beat professors; Qingdao female students opposed being labeled with \"puppet\" titles and opposed screening and were beaten to death, Shanghai Jiaotong University students were beaten for dissuading the army from moving furniture: traditionally, demonstrations are beaten, this time Chengdu Yenching University students were beaten for not wanting to demonstrate; in the Shanghai strike wave, there were many news reports of managers personally taking action and beating people...\n    Recently, those who fought bloody battles for eight years to liberate the territory from the enemy are easily denounced as \"bandits\"; and they have hindered his \"sacred,\" \"supreme,\" whatever. What exactly have you hindered that is \"sacred\" and \"supreme\"? You lost the Northeast for fourteen years with the three words of non-resistance, not allowing the people to commemorate, not allowing the people to discuss. After the War of Resistance, you openly declared that restoring the situation before the July 7th Incident would be peaceful, clearly handing over the Northeast again, but now you want to swear to \"defend with iron and blood\" and \"spare no sacrifice\" – it really makes people suspicious; could it be that some \"sacred\" and \"supreme\" alliance of yours has been destroyed by us?\n    From this, it can be seen that beating is legal, nationwide, planned, and step-by-step; but before beating, one must talk nonsense to find an excuse to cover it up. This is a kind of shameless rogue tactic before a fascist attack. Whether it is Hitler or the Chinese fascist head, in Southern dialect it is called \"fā shénjīng\" (going crazy), but they are not really neurotic!\n    A rare piece of news found in an old newspaper is enough to prove it.\n    The Shanghai newspaper of March 16 published the following news: After the strike at the New Asia Clothing Company caused a conflict: \"Manager Zhu Xingeng suddenly rushed into the accounting counter, raised an inkstone, and broke the glass himself, and poured a bottle of blue ink on his face, and then blew the police whistle to call the police, trying to falsely accuse the workers. At that time, the audience gathered, but the blue ink was all smeared on the boss's hands and face, and there was not a drop on the workers. At this point, Zhu admitted without being beaten that it was all done by one person, and claimed to have a history of mental illness.\"\n    So that's how it is! Doesn't the small thug paint a wonderful portrait for the big thug? There will always be such a day: this executioner will run bloodily in front of the people to confess without being beaten! Although he does not \"have a history of mental illness,\" he does suffer from Hitler-style \"neurosis.\" This fascist bellicose disease will bury him just like burying Hitler!\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    Zhōngguó (China)\n日耳曼民族   Rì'ěrmàn mínzú (Germanic nation)\n东北  Dōngběi (Northeast China)\n\n希特勒  Xītèlè (Hitler)\n竺新庚  Zhú Xīnggēng\n荒煤  Huáng Mu\n\n第二次欧战  Dì'èrcì Ōuzhàn (Second European War)\n七七事变  Qīqī Shìbiàn (July 7th Incident, Marco Polo Bridge Incident)\n政治协商会议  Zhèngzhì Xiéshāng Huìyì (Political Consultative Conference)\n\n新亚服装公司  Xīn Yà Fúzhuāng Gōngsī (New Asia Clothing Company)\n上海交通大学  Shànghǎi Jiāotōng Dàxué (Shanghai Jiaotong University)\n燕京大学  Yānjīng Dàxué (Yenching University)\n青岛   Qīngdǎo (Qingdao)\n\n陪都  Péidū (Accompanying Capital, referring to Chongqing during the war)\n首都  Shǒudū (Capital, referring to Nanjing)\n故都  Gùdū (Ancient Capital, referring to Nanjing)\n上海  Shànghǎi (Shanghai)\n广州  Guǎngzhōu (Guangzhou)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 希特勒式的“神经病”\n荒煤\n1946-05-15\n第4版()\n专栏：\n\n　　希特勒式的“神经病”\n    我记得，第二次欧战爆发之初，希特勒每在进兵那一国之前，向例要先发一通演讲：说他那“神圣”的日耳曼民族在那里如何遭受了污辱、残杀，这是他不忍受的，他发誓要消灭这些“匪徒”……于是炮声响了，坦克飞机一涌而进，将反法西斯人民的尸体悬遍了大街上的电线杆子！\n    这希特勒残酷的屠杀，曾使得号称文明的欧美人大为震骇；因之，一时曾出现了不少记者的文章，用种种材料来证明希特勒是“神经病”。似乎不如此，则无法理解，这个在二十世纪用尽一切力量来进行人类大屠杀的刽子手！以后，似乎没有听到有什么结论。\n    回头看看我们中国，这一点还很进步；还没有人出来叫唤说，我们中国式的法西斯头子也有神经病。虽然这个特务头子自从叛变革命屠杀人民以来，其手段，其纪录绝不亚于他祖宗，甚至有过之无不及。\n    不过，他身穿长袍，外披大氅，原是个“中西合璧”的古董，投抗战之机，居然胜利，多少给外表添了些光彩，却又是一个奴才，倒底还不会侵犯到洋老子头上去——至于对内，中国地广人众，死些老百姓，早已不足为奇了，——因此还不曾劳外国记者来研究他是否也有神经病。\n    我们是知道他没有神经病的。\n    往远看，这个特务头子过去也常常曾经用“至上”“神圣”啊这一类字眼来发表一通演说，然后就是一场血战，屠杀了上千万人民。往近看，刚刚声明了要执行政协决议，要实行民主，紧接着就又号召全国大打出手，从陪都到首都、到故都、到上海、广州……对于无寸铁的人民，一片杀气腾腾！打政协代表，打报馆，打学校；学校的学生打学生，打教授；青岛女学生反对带“伪”字头衔，反对甄别而被打杀，上海交大学生为劝阻军队不运走家具而挨打：向来游行都是挨打的，这次成都燕大学生不愿游行也被打；上海罢工热潮中，有不少经理亲自出马大打出手的新闻……。\n    最近，对八年浴血奋斗从敌人手里解放国土的人，动不动斥为“匪徒”；又妨碍了他的“神圣的”“至上的”什么什么。倒底妨碍了你“神圣的”“至上的”什么呢？你以不抵抗三字把东北丢了十四年，不准人民纪念，不准人民议论。抗战以后，还公开声明恢复七七事变前之情况即可和平，明明又把东北拱手相让，现在却要誓“铁血保卫”，“不惜任何牺牲”了——真叫人怀疑；莫非你有个什么“圣神的”“至上的”同盟被我们破坏了么？\n    由此可见，打是合法的，全国性的，有计划有步骤的；不过打之前，要胡言乱语找个借口来掩饰一下，这是法西斯进攻前的一种无耻的流氓手段。无论希特勒也好，中国法西斯头子也好，用一句南方话说叫作“发神经”却并非真有神经病也！\n    从旧报中偶得一珍闻，则更足以证明。\n    三月十六的上海报纸发表这样一条新闻：新亚服装公司因为罢工引起冲突后：“经理竺新庚突然狂奔入账房柜台举砚将玻璃自行击破，并将蓝墨水一瓶倒翻涂在自己脸上，随即大吹警笛，召来岗警，企图诬控职工。当时观众云集，惟蓝墨水全涂在老板手脸，职工身上并无点滴。至此竺某不打自招，承认全系一人所为，并称素有神经病云。”\n    原来如此！小打手不亦为大打手画出一幅绝妙的写照么？将来也总会有这么一天：要这个刽子手血淋淋的跑在人民面前来不打自招的！虽然他并不“素有神经病”，但他确实又害的是希特勒式的“神经病”，这种法西斯好战的病症，将和埋葬希特勒一样的埋葬了他！"

All parties believe that the issues of stopping the blocking and first restoring the dikes and dredging the river cannot be resolved in Bian and must be negotiated in Nanjing.\" Based on this, our Jinji-Luyu Border Region Government has now decided to send Zhao Mingfu and Wang Xiaoyi, two representatives from the Kaifeng delegation, to Nanjing to negotiate with the Kuomintang Central Government on the implementation of the Heze Agreement.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n开封\tKaifeng\n晋冀鲁豫边府 Jinji-Luyu Bianfu (Jinji-Luyu Border Region Government)\n黄委会\tHuang Wei Hui (Yellow River Committee)\n国民党 government \tGuomindang government (Kuomintang government)\n全国水利委员会\tQuanguo Shuili Weiyuanhui (National Water Conservancy Commission)\n薛笃弼\tXue Dubi\n荷泽协议\tHeze Xieyi (Heze Agreement)\n花园口\tHuayuankou\n陇海路\tLonghai Lu (Longhai Railway)\n晋冀鲁豫边区政府\tJinji-Luyu Bianqu Zhengfu (Jinji-Luyu Border Region Government)\n赵明甫\tZhao Mingfu\n王笑一\tWang Xiaoyi\n南京\tNanjing\n国民党中央\tGuomindang Zhongyang (Kuomintang Central Government)\n新华社\tXinhua News Agency\n邯郸\tHandan\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 开封会谈宣告停顿  边府决定派员赴京协商\n\n1946-05-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　开封会谈宣告停顿\n    边府决定派员赴京协商\n    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社邯郸讯】晋冀鲁豫边府驻开封黄委会代表团于九日来电称：“国民党政府全国水利委员会主任薛笃弼曾于二日赴汴，不仅对荷泽协议根本不提，且花园口堵口工程仍加紧进行，现土工业已大部完成，最近即准备打桩，而陇海路以北之复堤工程并未作任何准备。上月廿日，在花园口会谈时，各方共同决定在八日会谈，竟又无形停开。”又称：“违反荷泽协议，继续堵口，固系国民党当局之主张，各方认为停止堵口先行复堤浚河等问题在汴无法解决，须到南京协商。”据此，我晋冀鲁豫边区政府现已决定派开封代表团之赵明甫、王笑一二代表前赴南京，与国民党中央协商执行荷泽协议问题。"

The company originally set its total capital at 250,000,000 yuan, and now various sectors have subscribed up to 200,000,000 yuan. The various factories and companies under its jurisdiction have also raised more than 100,000,000 yuan in share capital. In recent days, many industrialists and businessmen from outside the Liberated Area have sent letters to the company inquiring about its operating nature and scope, as well as the rights and limits of shareholders. Many capitalists arriving here, after visiting the operational status of the company's various factories, have expressed great approval for the democratic government's policy of supporting and encouraging the development of private enterprises. Some capitalists, due to funds not being remitted immediately, have mostly pre-subscribed to investment amounts with the preparatory office. Mr. Lin Mingqi, who came to Zhangjiakou from Tianjin and Beijing, invested 600,000 yuan in cash in one go. The person in charge of the company's preparatory office recently told our agency: \"Based on the enthusiastic share subscriptions from all parties, it is estimated that the original total amount of fundraising can be completed by the end of this month, and it will be exceeded. Once the share capital is raised, the original government investment will be repaid as soon as possible, and the entire enterprise will be converted into private ownership.\"\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n晋察冀边区  Jin-Cha-Ji Bianqu (Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region)\n兴华实业公司    Xinghua Shiye Gongsi (Xinghua Industrial Company)\n张家口  Zhangjiakou\n林明棋  Lin Mingqi\n平津  Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin)\nXinhua News Agency  Xinhua News Agency\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 张市筹设兴华实业公司  外区资本家踊跃投资\n\n1946-05-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　张市筹设兴华实业公司\n    外区资本家踊跃投资\n    【新华社张家口九日电】晋察冀边区兴华实业公司，自筹备成立以来，解放区内外企业界人士及一般商民，均踊跃认股投资。该公司原定资本总额为二十五万万元，现已由各界分认达二十万万元，所属各厂、各公司亦募得股金一万万余元。连日来解放区以外各工商人士，投函向该公司询问经营性质与范围以及股东权限等问题者甚多，络绎抵此的许多资本家，于参观该公司所属各厂经营状况后，对民主政府扶助与奖励私营企业发展的政策，均极表赞同，有些资本家因款项未能即刻汇来，多向筹备处预认投资的额数。由平津来张的林明棋先生，一次即以现款入股六十余万元。该公司筹备处负责人顷语本社记者称：“根据各方踊跃入股状况估计，本月底当可完成原定的募集总额，并将超过。一俟股款募足，即尽先偿付原来政府的投资，将全部企业转为私营”。"

    "content": "I Transported Grain and Cloth to Jin and Shi\n    Repeatedly Intercepted by Kuomintang Troops\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Nangong, 10th] In recent months, grain and cloth from the Jinnan Liberated Area have been transported in large quantities to major cities such as Tianjin and Shijiazhuang. According to incomplete statistics from the Jinnan Bureau of Industry and Commerce, merchants transported more than six million jin of grain to Tianjin in January alone. The trading company transported two million jin of wheat and one million and eighty thousand jin of millet in March. The large number of cloth shipments can be seen from the changes in cloth prices from the Liberated Area to Tianjin. Last year, the price of cloth in Tianjin was 1,500 yuan per foot in puppet currency, while in the Liberated Area it was 15 yuan per foot in Jicha banknotes. This year, the price in Tianjin has fallen to 500 yuan per foot in puppet currency, while in the Liberated Area it is 20 yuan per foot. During the transportation of goods to various cities, they were illegally obstructed by the Kuomintang and puppet troops. Merchants from Linqing transporting six boats of rice and wheat to Tianjin were completely detained by the puppet troops in Dezhou. A few days ago, grain merchants from Hengshui to Tianjin were detained by local Kuomintang officials, and it took considerable effort and heavy funds to redeem them.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n天津\tTianjin\n石门\tShimen (short for Shijiazhuang)\n冀南解放区\tJinnan Liberated Area\n冀南工商局\tJinnan Bureau of Industry and Commerce\n临清\tLinqing\n德县\tDezhou\n衡水\tHengshui\n新华社\tXinhua News Agency\n南宫\tNangong\n伪币\tpuppet currency\n冀钞\tJicha banknotes\n国民党\tKuomintang\n伪军\tpuppet troops\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 我以粮布输入津石  沿途迭遭国民党军拦劫\n\n1946-05-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　我以粮布输入津石\n    沿途迭遭国民党军拦劫\n    【新华社南宫十日电】近数月来，冀南解放区粮食布匹，大批输入天津、石门等各大城市。据冀南工商局不完整统计，仅一月份商民输到天津粮食六百万斤以上。贸易公司三月份内即运出小麦二百万斤，小米一百零八万斤。而布匹运出数目之大，从解放区到天津布置变动，即可看出。去年天津布价每尺合伪币一千五百元，解放区每尺冀钞十五元。今年天津每尺落至伪钞五百元，解放区每尺二十元。在运送物资到各城市途中，遭国民党及伪军非法阻难，临清商人运米及麦子六船去津，中途被德县伪军全部扣留。日前又有粮商自衡水至津途中，遭当地国民党官员扣留，经多方托人，始以重资赎回。"

Garrison troops in Zhuozishan have already reclaimed 4,000 mu of wasteland. Garrison troops in the Jinzhong plains, due to the scarcity of wasteland in the local area, are not only assisting the masses in repairing canals and dredging ditches, but also organizing production teams to reclaim wasteland in the mountainous areas of Wenshui, Fenyang, and Xiaoyi. A certain regiment of the garrison in Pingyao, with the consent of the government and the masses, acquired 880 mu of river滩 land and communal land. Each company plants an average of ten mu of various corn types and has leased a portion of irrigated land to plant 120 mu of vegetables. The regimental headquarters stipulates that each unit plant five mu of vegetable land, and each soldier in the company plant two mu of land, completing the task of self-sufficiency in 39 jin of rice and grain, four months of vegetables, and oil and salt expenses. The 106th Regiment has each soldier planting two mu of land, completing the task of self-sufficiency in 39 jin of rice and grain, four months of vegetables, and oil and salt expenses. The 121st Regiment has organized two farming groups, one producing in other locations and one producing in the garrison. In general, companies of the Sixth Brigade complete 1.1 shi of public grain per person, and 2.2 shi for personal production. In the production process, officers and soldiers work together. Ying Chang, the Battalion Commander of the \"Adhere\" department, took the lead, actively collecting manure and reclaiming wasteland, which promoted the development of production competitions in various companies. The sowing is now largely completed. Various units are also engaged in sideline production. The \"Adhere\" department organized a salt boiling cooperative, and the entire regiment can be self-sufficient in alkali salt. In addition to their own production, the garrisons in various places are actively helping the masses in production. The companies of the 102nd Regiment take turns sending people to help the dependents of revolutionary martyrs and impoverished people in the garrison area.

I know,\" Yang Xiaoyu said triumphantly, pursing his lips. He fiddled with a textbook and said with a smile, \"The other day when you were talking to that uncle, I heard you talking about Chairman Mao, saying how great Chairman Mao is. People in the Kuomintang only talk about Chairman Chiang, only Communists talk about Chairman Mao, right?\"\n    Another day, Yang Xiaoyu was picking up his schoolbag to go to school when he suddenly discovered a \"Jin-Cha-Ji Pictorial\" behind his father's bookshelf. It had a huge picture of Chairman Mao printed on it. He looked at it again and again, thinking, \"It would be good for my classmates to see Chairman Mao too.\" So he folded the pictorial, stuffed it into his schoolbag, and skipped and jumped to school.\n    The classroom was still empty, quiet. Xiaoyu sat down and took out the pictorial, spreading it on the desk. He lowered his head, studying Chairman Mao's eyebrows, nose, lips, and eyes over and over. He thought, \"Truly a great man!\"\n    Gradually, more and more classmates arrived, and everyone crowded around, four or five pairs of round eyes curiously focused on Chairman Mao's face.\n    \"Who is it?\" one child asked.\n    \"It's Chairman Mao! It's the great Chairman Mao!\" Yang Xiaoyu immediately straightened his chest and raised his hand to his cap brim: \"Salute!

Using their fabricated facts, they coerced Comrade Wang Qing, acting leader of the Liaison Group, to sign and stamp the document, acknowledging their claims. Comrade Wang Qing sternly refused. The plainclothes special agents then hurled abuse, shouted wildly, and struck him. Comrade Wang Qing's left arm was broken, his pocket was torn, and they robbed him of 5,000 Jichaos, more than 40,000 in legal currency, one medal, one fountain pen, and nine documents, and unreasonably detained him for twelve hours. The next day, our Liaison Group personnel conducted street propaganda in the city, exposing the shameless behavior of the special agents. The news spread throughout the city. Even under the rule of special agents, people in the streets and alleys spoke out righteously, denouncing the brutality of the special agents. They said to our side: \"You are truly sincere in advocating peace.\" Afterwards, our Liaison Group lodged a protest with the East Qin Line Executive Group, demanding severe punishment for such hooligan behavior by the KMT special agents, and guaranteeing the safety of our personnel to facilitate the mediation work.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n沁县  Qin County\n阎军  Yan Army\n白晋线  Bai-Jin Line\n中共  CCP (Chinese Communist Party)\n王清  Wang Qing\n冀钞  Jichao (currency of the Jicha area)\n法币  Legal currency\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n长治  Changzhi\n东沁线小组  East Qin Line Group\n国特  KMT special agents\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 沁县阎军特务横行  殴劫我联络组人员  我已向东沁线小组提出抗议\n\n1946-05-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　沁县阎军特务横行\n    殴劫我联络组人员\n    我已向东沁线小组提出抗议\n    【新华社长治十日电】白晋线阎军伪造所谓“控诉共党罪行”，已在沁县城内演出殴打中共联络组人员事件。四月三十日晚，突有便衣特务卅余人，身带短枪，口称“请愿”，闯入我中共驻沁县联络组住宅，以其捏造之事实，威迫该联络组代理组长王清同志签名盖章，予以承认，当遭王清同志严正拒绝，该便衣特务等即肆口谩骂，狂啸乱打，王清同志左臂打断，衣袋撕碎，抢去冀钞五千元，法币四万余元，勋章一个，水笔一枝，文件九件，并无理扣押十二小时。次日我联络组人员在城内沿街宣传，揭发特务的无耻行为，消息传遍全城，虽在特务统治下，街谈巷议，无不仗义执言痛绝特务暴行。而向我方说：“你们才真是诚心诚意讲和平的。”事后我联络组即向东沁线执行小组提出抗议，要求严惩国特此种流氓行为，保障我方人员安全，以利调处工作之进行。"

A large number of French newspapers subsidized by financial capitalists reflected the opinions of the right-wing reactionaries, and these newspapers played a considerable role in propaganda. In their propaganda, the reactionaries also used France's current economic difficulties, blaming them on the current government, saying that the tripartite government was incapable of revitalizing the country. But in fact, the economic difficulties were caused by the ambiguous activities of the big financiers and the slowdown of the industrialists. We believe that the temporary victory obtained by the reactionary forces will certainly not cause disorder in the ranks of the new democrats. However, this matter once again underscores the importance of all democratic forces uniting to fight against the reactionary forces—the followers of Pétain, the Vichy elements, and all kinds of fascists.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n中国    China\n法国\tFaguo\n新华社\tXinhua She\n塔斯社\tTasi She\n延安\tYan'an\n巴黎\tBali\n消息报\tXiaoxi Bao\n共和自由党\tGonghe Ziyou Dang\n人民共和运动\tRenmin Gonghe Yundong\n急进社会党\tJijin Shehui Dang\n贝当\tBeidang\n维希\tWeixi\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 法国宪草复决失败原因\n\n1946-05-15\n第3版()\n专栏：\n\n　　法国宪草复决失败原因\n    消息报记者报导\n    【新华社延安十日电】塔斯社巴黎八日电：消息报记者报导法国宪草复决失败的原因说：大家知道，反动派如共和自由党、人民共和运动急进社会党的右翼等，并进行了疯狂的反对新宪宣传，受金融资本家津贴的大量法国报纸，反映了右翼反动派的言论，这些报纸在宣传上起了颇大作用。反动分子在宣传中还运用法国当前的经济困难，把它归罪于现政权，他们说三党政府没有能力使国家复兴，可其事实上，经济的困难，是由于大金融家的暧昧勾当，与工业家的怠工所造成的。我们相信，使反动势力获得暂时胜利的，决不会在新民主主义者行列中打起紊乱，可是，这件事又一次加重了一切民主势力团结一致为反对反动势力们——贝当的党徒、维希分子以及一切种类的法西斯分子——而斗争的重要性。"

    "content": "Coal Miners' Strike Extends for Forty Days\n    American Industry Plunges into Stagnation\n    Chicago, Washington, and Other Cities Plunged into Darkness\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th] The coal miners' strike, lasting forty days in demand for improved living conditions, has shaken the entire United States. Its impact has been quite significant, not only reducing coal production but also bringing railway transportation, various industries, electricity, and water supplies to a near standstill. According to US Secretary of the Interior Krug, the coming months will bring even greater blows. Since the beginning of the strike, coal shipments overseas in April have decreased by 50%, from the original quota of 1.6 million tons. If the strike does not end this month, it will drop to 15% of normal levels. The coal shortage in the United States next year will be worse than during any period of the war. Krug estimates that coal production losses in April reached 53 million tons, with a continuing weekly loss of 13 million tons. Due to the lack of coal, major cities such as Chicago, Washington, and Philadelphia have been plunged into darkness, and ice companies predict losses of 300 million pounds of food. The New York Central Railroad announced that 126 trains would be suspended on the 10th, paralyzing many industries. Ford Motor Company has had to suspend operations for its 110,000 workers due to fuel shortages. A General Motors spokesman said the plant would close in ten days, leaving 115,000 workers unemployed by next Monday. Manager DeGise of the American Can Company stated that the coal miners' strike has gradually affected the tinplate industry, and the threat of severe food shortages may continue until 1947.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th] Labor unrest in the United States continues to expand. According to recent statistics from the US Department of Labor, 1.6 million workers are still on strike. Following the coal miners' strike, five maritime unions in the United States have resolved to demand higher wages and improved working conditions; otherwise, they will blockade and strike all ships in American ports on June 15th. The union also called on organized labor worldwide to support the strike, which, if implemented, would paralyze American ports.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n美国\tMěiguó (United States)\n芝加哥\tZhījiāgē (Chicago)\n华盛顿\tHuáshèngdùn (Washington)\n费城\tFèichéng (Philadelphia)\n延安\tYán'ān\n新华社\tXīnhuá Shè (Xinhua News Agency)\n克鲁格\tKèlǔgé (Krug)\n内务部长\tNèiwù Bùzhǎng (Secretary of the Interior)\n福特汽车公司\tFútè Qìchē Gōngsī (Ford Motor Company)\n通用汽车公司\tTōngyòng Qìchē Gōngsī (General Motors)\n德吉斯\tDé Jísī (DeGise)\n美国罐头公司\tMěiguó Guàntou Gōngsī (American Can Company)\n纽约中央铁路局\tNiǔyuē Zhōngyāng Tiělùjú (New York Central Railroad)\n美劳工局\tMěi Láogōng Jú (US Department of Labor)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 煤矿工潮绵延四旬  美工业陷停顿状态  芝加哥华盛顿等城已黑暗无光\n\n1946-05-15\n第3版()\n专栏：\n\n　　煤矿工潮绵延四旬\n    美工业陷停顿状态\n    芝加哥华盛顿等城已黑暗无光\n    【新华社延安十一日电】为要求改善生活条件而坚持四旬的煤矿工人大罢工，已震动全美，影响所及，颇为巨大，此不仅使煤产因而减低，而且使铁路运输、各工业、电气及自来水来源等，几陷于停顿状态。据美内务部长克鲁格称：今后数月，将予人以更重大打击。自罢工开始以来，四月份运往海外之煤减少百分之五十，原定额为一百六十万吨。本月份罢工如不终止，则更将降至平时之百分之十五，而来年美国缺乏煤之情形，将较战时任何时期更为恶劣。克氏估计四月份煤之生产损失达五千三百万吨，而目下每星期继续损失一千三百万吨。由于煤炭缺乏，芝加哥、华盛顿与费城等大城市，已黑暗无光，冰冻公司预示将损失三万万磅食粮。纽约中央铁路局通告，一百二十六列火车将于十日停驶，由此将使许多工业陷于麻痹状态。福特汽车公司，由于燃料缺乏，该厂十一万工人不得不停止工作。通用汽车公司发言人称：该厂将在十日内关门，至下星期一止，将有十一万五千名工人赋闲。美罐头公司经理德吉斯称：由于煤矿工人罢工，已渐影响及锡铁工业，严重的粮食欠缺的威胁，可能延续至一九四七年。\n    【新华社延安十一日电】美工潮继续扩大中。据美劳工局最近统计，迄今罢工工人仍有一百六十万人。继煤矿工人大罢工后，美国五个海员工会决议要求提高工资，改善工作条件，否则将美国各港口所有舰只在六月十五日封锁罢航。该工会并号召全世界有组织的劳工支持此罢工，罢工一旦实现，将使美国各港口陷于麻痹状态。"

The Japanese Communist Party strongly advocates for the establishment of a democratic government based on a democratic front and opposes the proposal of the Socialist Party cooperating with war criminals within the Liberal Party. Furthermore, after the Japanese Communist Party's request to form a democratic front cabinet with the Socialist Party was repeatedly rejected by Shidehara, this request has now been re-submitted. Tokuda Kyuichi, the General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, warned Shidehara, \"You have already resigned, therefore you have no right to impose any conditions on the issue of cabinet formation.\" Okano Susumu, a leader of the Japanese Communist Party, stated, \"If you do not clarify your attitude, we will go directly to the Emperor and debate with him.\" Shidehara has not yet responded.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th] Comprehensive Report: After Shidehara decided that Katayama, the secretary of the Socialist Party (previously translated as the Social Democratic Party, hereafter all translated as the current name), should form a cabinet, according to Reuters and Associated Press reports, fierce struggles have broken out within the Socialist Party. Left-wing leaders such as Kato Kanju and the masses they lead strongly advocate for the establishment of a coalition cabinet with the Japanese Communist Party and other democratic parties, and advocate that the Emperor officially appoint Katayama to form a cabinet after an agreement is reached. Right-wing figures such as Hirano and Kono Mitsu (note: they were behind-the-scenes figures who plotted the war of aggression against China) advocate forming a cabinet in coalition with the Liberal Party and urge the Emperor to immediately move Katayama to form a cabinet. Some individuals from the centrist-leaning-left faction, such as Mizutani Chozaburo, advocate for the Socialist Party to be the mainstay of the new cabinet, forming a cabinet in coalition with the Liberal Party and the Cooperative National Party, while also accommodating the Japanese Communist Party. In order to strive for the realization of a democratic coalition cabinet, the Japanese Communist Party has put forward compromise conditions to Katayama, that is, if Katayama agrees to postpone the discussion of the constitution (the Emperor is scheduled to convene a temporary new parliament on the 15th of this month to discuss abolishing the Emperor's privileges from the conditions of the new constitution), the Japanese Communist Party can allow the existence of a royal family like in Britain.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n日本    Japan\n东京    Tokyo\n日本社会党  Nihon Shakaitō (Japanese Socialist Party)\n日本共产党  Nihon Kyōsantō (Japanese Communist Party)\n民主阵线  Democratic Front\n自由党    Jiyūtō (Liberal Party)\n币原    Shidehara\n德田球一  Tokuda Kyūichi\n冈野进    Okano Susumu\n天皇    Tennō (Emperor)\n加藤勘十  Katō Kanjū\n平野    Hirano\n河野密    Kōno Mitsu\n水谷长三郎  Mizutani Chōzaburō\n国民协同党  Kokumin Kyōdōtō (Cooperative National Party)\n延安    Yan'an\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 片山组阁搁浅  日共力主联合内阁\n\n1946-05-15\n第3版()\n专栏：\n\n　　片山组阁搁浅\n    日共力主联合内阁\n    【新华社延安十二日电】东京讯：日本社会党领导人，日来与日共谈判组织新闻问题，日共力主在民主阵线的基础上，建立民主政府，并反对社会党与自由党内战犯合作的提议。又讯：日共与社会党合组民主阵线内阁的要求，被币原屡次拒绝后，现在又重提此一要求，日共总书记德田球一向币原警告称：“你已经辞职，因此你对新闻组成问题，无权强施任何条件”。日共领袖冈野进称：“如果你不表明态度，我们就要到天享那里直接和他辩论去”，币原迄未置答。\n    【新华社延安十一日电】综合报导：币原决定社会党（前译社会民主党，以后均改现译名）书记片山组阁后，据路透合众社报导：社会党内部已展开激烈的斗争。加藤勘十等左派领袖和领导的群众，坚主与日共等民主党派成立联合内阁，并主张待成立协议后，日皇再正式任命片山组阁。而平野、河野密等右派（按他们曾是策任命侵华战争之幕后人物），则主张与自由党联合组阁，并敦促日皇立即动片山组阁。水谷长三郎等中派偏左的一部分人士，主张新阁中以社会党为主干，联合自由党和国民协同党组阁，同时容纳日共。日共为争取民主联合内阁的实现，曾对片山提出妥协条件，即片山如同意宪法延期讨论（日皇定本月十五日召集临时新议会，讨论从新宪法条件中废除天皇特权），日共可以允许如英国式的皇室存在。"

    "content": "【New China News Agency, Jinji Luyu General Branch News】A temporary work team from the Henan Branch of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), consisting of Meade (American), Boyde (Canadian), Wang Kejian, and doctors and technicians, ten people in total, arrived in Hua County, the fourth district of Ji-Lu-Yu, on the 23rd, 27th, and 30th of last month, respectively. They worked together with our Yu-Bei Office of the Jinji Luyu Relief Branch for twelve days, returning to Xinxiang on the 5th of this month. The materials brought this time included 4,000 bags of second, third, and fourth-grade flour, 160 packages of clothing, eight boxes of medicine, and 6 million yuan (in legal tender) for fertilizer and seeds. The distribution area this time covered seven counties: Neihuang, Junxian, Yanjin, Weinan, Hua County, Gaoling, and Linzheng. Each county designated one to three centralized locations for distributing flour, with half a bag for every four people and two bags for every eight people. The allocation for fertilizer and seeds was 10 yuan (in legal tender) per mu, with a maximum of five mu per household. Clothing was issued according to different needs and numbered for distribution, while medicine was distributed by medical institutions according to different needs. Regarding future relief work, our Yu-Bei Office put forward four suggestions: (1) Our representatives should participate in the relief efforts of the Henan Relief Branch. (2) The Henan Branch should establish regular contact with us in the future. (3) The principle of material distribution should not only be based on county towns, but should be allocated according to all villages, population, and disaster situation. (4) We request technical assistance. The team agreed with three of these four suggestions, but no agreement was reached on the organizational issue. After the relief work was completed, members of the team visited our liberated areas' factories, hospitals, schools, and rent reduction and interest rate reduction mass meetings in Hua County, Daokou, Puyang, and other places. They expressed admiration for our democratic life and the spirit of hard work and simplicity, especially praising the production mutual aid and rural cooperatives. In addition, the relief work team organized by UNRRA's Li Yade, Hede, and the Henan Branch's He Sihui and four other gentlemen arrived in Meng County on February 25, carrying 700 bags of flour, 143,000 yuan in cash, and five packages of clothing (totaling 400 items, with one to two or three pieces per item). The masses in the disaster areas generally believe that the relief supplies are too meager to compensate for the serious losses suffered by the people of northern Henan who persisted in the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines for the past eight years, and who have been repeatedly ravaged by the enemy puppets and Kuomintang troops. Currently, the people in various disaster areas are extending their hands for help, urgently awaiting relief from the trauma suffered over the past eight years.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\nOrganizations:\n\n联合国救济总署    United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA)\n晋冀鲁豫总分社    Jinji Luyu General Branch of the New China News Agency\n晋冀鲁豫救济分署豫北办事处    Yu-Bei Office of the Jinji Luyu Relief Branch\n河南救济分署    Henan Relief Branch\n新华社    New China News Agency\n\nPlaces:\n\n晋冀鲁豫    Jinji Luyu\n滑县    Hua County\n河南    Henan\n新乡    Xinxiang\n内黄    Neihuang\n浚县    Junxian\n延津    Yanjin\n卫南    Weinan\n高陵    Gaoling\n临征    Linzheng\n道口    Daokou\n濮阳    Puyang\n孟县    Meng County\n\nPeople:\n\n美德    Meade\n勃亚得    Boyde\n汪克俭    Wang Kejian\n李亚得    Li Yade\n赫德    Hede\n何思惠    He Sihui\n\nEvents:\n\n敌后抗战    Anti-Japanese War behind enemy lines\n减租减息群众会    Rent reduction and interest rate reduction mass meetings\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 联总救济物资一部先后运到我区发放  群众认为物资微少，不足弥补八年创伤\n\n1946-05-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　联总救济物资一部先后运到我区发放\n    群众认为物资微少，不足弥补八年创伤\n    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社讯】联合国救济总署行总河南分署之临时工作队美德（美籍）、勃亚得（加籍）、汪克俭及医师、技师等十人，于上月二十三、二十七、三十日先后到达冀鲁豫四分区滑县，与我晋冀鲁豫救济分署豫北办事处，共同进行救济工作，历时十二天，本月五日返回新乡。此次运来物资共计二、三、四等面粉四千袋，衣物一百六十包，药八箱，肥料、种子六百万元（法币），此次发放地为内黄，浚县、延津、卫南、滑县、高陵、临征等七县，每县指定一个至三个集中地点，发放面粉，每四人半袋，八人二袋。肥料、种子款每亩法币十元，每户最多以五亩地计。衣物则根据不同需要编号抽发，药品由医务机关根据不同需要发放。关于今后救济工作，我豫北办事处提出四点意见：（一）河南救济分署救济应有我方代表参加。（二）今后河南分署应与我方建立经常关系。（三）物资分配原则，不应只按县城为准，应按所有村庄，人口及灾情分配。（四）请求在技术上予我们以帮助，该队对于这四项意见，其中三项表示同意，惟组织问题未得协议。救济完毕后，该队人员分别到滑县、道口，濮阳等地参观我解放区工厂、医院、学校及减租减息群众会，对我民主生活，艰苦朴素作风，甚表欣佩，特别对生产互助及农村合作社更表赞同。又联总李亚得，赫德与河南分署何思惠等五先生所组织之救济工作队，曾于二月二十五日抵孟县，携带面粉七百袋，钞票十四万三千元，衣物五包（共计四百号，每号一件至两三件不等），各灾区群众咸认此次救济物资甚少，不能弥补八年来豫北人民坚持敌后抗战，及累遭敌伪及国民党军队摧残的严重损失，现各灾区人民正伸出求助之手，亟待救济八年所受的创伤。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-05-15",
    "page_number": "3",
    "content": "【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th】 Moscow Radio: Masinu published a commentary on the China issue, stating that the New York Times correspondent Gailky's Beijing dispatch on the 5th revealed the truth about Yan Xishan's collaboration with the Japanese army in China. He said: When Yan Xishan addressed Japanese officers in Taiyuan on March 10th, he expressed satisfaction with the achievements of Okamura Neji, the commander of the Japanese army in North China. Now Okamura is being treated very well in Nanjing, and Yan has declared to the officers of Okamura's staff that Japan did not suffer defeat in the war, especially in the war against China. Yan Xishan thanked the Japanese army for helping him. According to American news, Japanese officers live in beautiful buildings in Taiyuan, strutting around like victors. Japanese officers often fly freely between Beijing and Taiyuan. According to the investigation by the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation, Yan has preserved the Japanese army's own armed forces and sent them to the garrison areas close to the CCP army. Gailky personally saw many documents proving that a large number of Japanese troops are still in Shanxi, fighting under the command of Yan Xishan. Gailky stated: It is not the first time that Yan's collaboration with the Japanese army has been revealed in American publications. On February 12th, the New York Times published an interview by its correspondent Liebermann with Yan Xishan and Haraizumi Kaoru, the commander of the Japanese army in Shanxi. Haraizumi stated: Since the Japanese surrender, his army has not laid down its weapons. Until now, only 2,000 Japanese soldiers have been repatriated, while the remaining 42,000 Japanese troops continue to live in 292 mansions in Shanxi. Yan openly told Japanese officers that he must keep the Japanese army in Shanxi because he opposes the CCP. According to Liebermann, Japanese generals live in Yan Xishan's mansions and are his \"honored guests.\"\n    Recently, members of the Chongqing Shanxi Guild Hall pointed out at a press conference that Yan has not yet disarmed the Japanese army, nor has he held a Japanese surrender ceremony. He has neither repatriated the Japanese army nor disbanded the puppet army. Instead, he has reorganized the Japanese and puppet troops into armed forces to oppose the people. The oppression suffered by the residents of Shanxi is even worse than before the Japanese surrender. These actions of Yan are not surprising, because Yan has always been an extremely reactionary traitor who colluded closely with the Japanese invaders. Japanese imperialism has long used him to realize its plan to occupy North China. From 1929 to 1930, Yan, on the orders of Japan, led the Northern Alliance against the National Government. The Japanese greatly assisted this military operation, attempting to provoke a Chinese civil war. After the Northern Alliance failed militarily, Yan ran to Dalian and lived comfortably under Japanese protection. Later, he flew back to Taiyuan. When Japan invaded North China, they placed their most loyal lackey, Yan Xishan, in such an important strategic place as Shanxi. Yan tried his best to help Japan occupy North China. He turned Taiyuan into a base camp for Japanese spies and a nest of Chinese traitors. Japan implemented provocative tricks to occupy North China from here, slaughtering and persecuting anti-Japanese elements and patriotic people. When Wang Jingwei organized a puppet government in Nanjing, Yan immediately established close contact with the traitor Wang, while he himself still wore a patriotic mask. Japan knew when to use his loyal lackey. After the Japanese surrender, they used Yan to preserve their bases and a large number of armed forces in North China. Therefore, Japan still has the possibility of realizing its ruling task in China—undermining the unity of the Chinese people and provoking a Chinese civil war.\n    It is not surprising that Yan is working hard to implement Japan's plan, but what is strange is that the United States is also assisting this conspiracy. New York Times correspondent Gailky pointed out: Not long ago, at a meeting held by the Japanese liaison officer and the US military representative at the Japanese Army Staff Headquarters in Beijing, the Japanese officer reported the situation of the Japanese army fighting against the CCP army under the command of Yan Xishan. Gailky also pointed out that the meeting was conducted in a harmonious atmosphere. The United States has been trying to delay the repatriation of the Japanese army and praised the battle situation around Taiyuan. After the meeting, an American officer said: These Japanese officers should consult with them as consistently as their own allies.\n    Anyone who is concerned about China's political life will ask: Are the actions of the US military representatives in Beijing in line with the decisions of the Moscow Conference of the Three Powers regarding China? As everyone knows, the resolutions of the Moscow Conference of the Three Powers regarding China are about China's unification and democratization, cessation of the civil war, reaching an agreement, and faithfully adhering to the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n新华社   Xinhua News Agency\n延安   Yan'an\n莫斯科  Moscow\n马西努  Masinu\n纽约时报  New York Times\n盖尔基   Gailky\n北平   Beiping (Beijing)\n阎锡山   Yan Xishan\n太原   Taiyuan\n华北   North China\n冈村宁次  Okamura Neji\n南京   Nanjing\n中共   CCP\n军调执行部  Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation\n里伯尔曼  Liebermann\n原泉馨  Haraizumi Kaoru\n重庆  Chongqing\n汪精卫  Wang Jingwei\n大连   Dalian\n北方同盟  Northern Alliance\n山西  Shanxi\n三强莫斯科会议  Moscow Conference of the Three Powers\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏评论家马西努著论  痛斥阎锡山勾结日寇  美军帮助日阎进攻解放区，不符莫斯科二国决议\n\n1946-05-15\n第3版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏评论家马西努著论\n    痛斥阎锡山勾结日寇\n    美军帮助日阎进攻解放区，不符莫斯科二国决议\n    【新华社延安十二日电】莫斯科广播：马西努对中国问题发表评论称：美纽约时报访员盖尔基五日北平电讯，揭露了阎锡山勾结在华日军之真象。他说：阎锡山三月十日在太原对日本军官致词时，表示满意华北日军司令冈村宁次的功绩。现在冈村在南京很受优待，阎氏曾向冈村参谋部的军官声明，日本在战争中，尤其是在对华战争中，并未遭受失败。阎锡山感谢日军为他帮忙。据美国消息指出７日本军官在太原住着漂亮的楼房，象胜利者一样，趾高气扬。日本军官经常乘飞机自由来往北平、太原之间。据军调执行部查明，阎氏保存着日军自己的武装，并将其派赴接近中共军的驻区去。盖尔基亲眼见到许多文件，证明日本大批部队仍继续在山西，由阎锡山指挥作战。盖尔基称：在美国刊物上揭露阎氏勾结日军已不止一次，二月十二日的纽约时报就已登载该报访员里伯尔曼的阎氏与山西日军司令原泉馨的谈话，原泉称：从日本投降日起，他的军队就未放下武器，直到现在，遣送回国的日军兵士仅二千人，而其余四万二千日军部队，继续住在山西二百九十二个公馆里。阎氏公开告诉日本军官说：他因为反对中共，所以必须把日军留在山西。据里伯尔曼说：日本将军住在阎锡山的公馆里，并为阎氏的“上宾”。\n    最近重庆山西会馆人员在记者招待会上，曾指出阎氏直到现在，并未解除日军武装，亦未举行日本投降典礼，既没有遣送日军返国，亦没有解散伪军，反而将日伪军队编成反对人民的武装部队。山西居民所受压迫较日本投降前变本加厉。阎氏的这些行动，是不足为奇的，因为阎氏一向就是极端反动的、与日寇密切勾结的卖国贼，日本帝国主义早就利用他实现其侵占华北的计划。一九二九年至三○年，阎氏奉日本之命，领导反对国民政府的北方同盟，日本人曾大大援助这一军事行动，他们企图挑起中国内战。北方同盟在军事上失败之后，阎氏即跑到大连，在日本保护下，逍遥自在，后他又飞回太原。当日本侵略华北时，他们又把自己最忠实的走狗——阎锡山，安置在山西这样重要的战略地方。阎氏竭力帮助日本侵占华北，他曾将太原变成日本奸细的大本营、中国卖国贼的巢穴。日本从这里实施侵占华北的挑拨诡计，屠杀迫害抗日分子与爱国志士。当汪精卫在南京组织傀儡政府时，阎氏马上与汪逆建立密切联系，而他自己仍戴着爱国的假面具。日本深知在什么时机利用他的忠实走狗，在日本投降以后，便利用阎氏保存了自己在华北的根据地及大量武装力量，因此日本还有可能实现在中国的统治任务——破坏中国人民的统一，挑起中国的内战。\n    阎氏努力实行日本的计划本不足为奇，而奇怪的是美国也在援助这一勾当。纽约时报访员盖尔基指出：不久前，日军联络官与美军代表在日军北平参谋部举行的会议上，日军官，告日本在阎锡山指挥下向中共军作战的情形。盖尔基并指出，这次会议是在和睦气氛下进行的，美国竭立延缓遣送日军回国，并赞扬太原一带的战况。会议后，一个美国军官说道：这些日本军官应该像自己的盟军一样与他们协商一致。\n    凡是关切中国政治生活的人，都会发问：美军代表在北平的行动，是与三强莫斯科会议关于中国的决议相符合吗？大家知道，三强莫斯科会议关于中国的决议，是关于中国统一与民主化，停止内战，达到协定，以及忠实于不干涉中国内政的政策。"

    "content": "The Heroic Defense of Siping Street\n    Liu Baiyu\n    The reporter has been traveling through the fiercely contested front lines all day. The defense of Siping Street has entered its twenty-fourth day. Here, the people's loyal guards have written the most heroic page. For more than twenty days, this piece of land has been under relentless bombardment. The New First Army, equipped with American weapons and possessing a menacing brutality, once launched a fierce attack with an average firing rate of thirty shells per minute. But they were stopped. The glorious Siping Street front line remained stubbornly unyielding, like a stone mountain. Siping Street, at the intersection of two railways, is a city with tens of thousands of people. To be fair, it is not a particularly strategic or dangerous place. There are only one or two high points nearby, and a small river in front. The reactionary army attacked the city simultaneously from the south, southwest, and part of the northwest. The sound of artillery could be heard from thirty miles away. The soldiers resolutely carried out their tasks in their low bunkers.\n    When they first entered these bunkers, the company commander of the Tenth Company, the political instructor, and their platoon leader swore to everyone: \"I vow to hold this place to the death, and even in death, my body will block the enemy!\"\n    After the intensely stressful first day of fighting, suddenly—from one company to one battalion, and then from one battalion to one regiment—this oath spread to become everyone's motto. They meticulously recorded it under the intense artillery fire, writing it in letters to their beloved and trusted commander, Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao. In the raging storm and rain, the soldiers fired from the bunkers during the day and used the sturdy blockhouses to resist at night. In one bunker, which was a heavy machine gun position for a squad, the right wall inside the work area read: \"Aim Accurately and Shoot.\" The left wall read: \"Fear No Sacrifice or Bloodshed.\" The front was numbered, indicating the positions of the shooter and grenadier. I firmly believe that our soldiers have a deep affection for their positions. During the battle, one squad was reduced to just two men: Squad Leader Wan Jinhe and soldier Xia Jingchun. They finally resolved that the squad leader said: \"As long as we're alive, we can't let the position fall. We'll prepare our grenades and hit them when they come up.\" Sure enough, the reactionary forces launched three frontal assaults on this position with a company, but they were all repelled. They persisted for a day and a night. At dawn, new troops came to relieve them for rest, and they were still reluctant to leave their beloved position.\n    I understand, I know why they have such spirit. The other day, on a dry and hot dusk, I was on a dust-covered street. I saw a stretcher team coming from the front line. I spoke to one of them, a young man named Zhang, a leatherworker who lived on Siping Street's Third Road. He told me enthusiastically: \"Comrade, the Kuomintang can't get in. At first, they said they wouldn't eat if they didn't get in within three days, but then they said a week. Now I hear they're saying maybe a month.\" He was a very humorous and interesting person, but his confidence came from the reality of more than twenty days of iron and blood. I asked him why, and he simply replied: \"Even if airplanes and cannons level Siping Street, we won't retreat. What use is it?\" This is the source of invincible strength. The masses of Siping Street are not lovers of war. They are hopeful for peace. Just the day before the war, twenty thousand representatives of families, representing two hundred thousand citizens, signed a petition requesting peace, intending to send it to the executive group in Shenyang. When peace became hopeless, they heard that the \"bandits\" were coming again (they hated the reactionary troops, calling them \"bandits\"; while the Democratic Allied Army was whom they had written to invite). They silently and resolutely stood beside the Democratic Allied Army soldiers and began digging fortifications. Seven thousand people did this. But they were concerned: Could these brothers withstand the \"monkey team\" (they called the New First Army soldiers in American uniforms the \"monkey team\")? Flames flickered, and a barrage of artillery roared like an avalanche. Our district government cadres stood on the lookout post, marking down each round with a pencil, unable to keep up with the dense sound of artillery. Everyone was concerned about the front line, watching two messengers run forward but unable to get through, falling to the ground. Half an hour later, a call came from the front line, the voice of the company commander: \"The position is good, only one man injured, please reassure the leaders.\" At this point, the people laughed heartily. Now they are very happy to hear the artillery fire. They say to the comrades in the army: \"We are happy when we hear that you are fighting well.\"\n    One day, as the sun was setting, the enemy's firepower subsided. Suddenly, the people of the three districts east of the railway crowded into the government, saying to the district head: \"The comrades at the front are shedding blood and sacrificing themselves for us, the people. We have prepared some biscuits and eggs to comfort the comrades.\" The district head said, \"The target is too big, I am afraid of losses,\" and advised them not to go, but no one was willing. Later, they thought of a way, which was to elect representatives to go to the front line. The soldiers poked their heads out of the fortifications and said: \"For the peace and democracy of the Northeast, this is nothing.\"\n    In these difficult days, because of the blood that flowed together, the army and the people in Siping Street formed a steel-like bond.\n    Now, during the day, every household stays indoors. They have dug cellars in their courtyards, and at night they cover the windows with black cloth so that no light from the electric lamps can be seen. The power lines are often broken by artillery fire at night, and the municipal government leads some workers to repair them during the day. Cars patrol the streets day and night, and the main streets are covered with sandbag fortifications.\n    According to statistics from the first fifteen days, a total of fifty-five people died and one hundred and forty-three were injured in the five districts of Siping Street. Hundreds of houses were destroyed.\n    The numbers of sacrifices and losses have aroused not fear, but the flames of resentment!\n    An old man was hit in the knee by shrapnel, which penetrated the bone. He was immediately sent to the hospital. Immediately, the district head and the secretary of the Communist Party district committee came to see him and brought him eggs, telling him that he had been allocated ten mu of enemy-occupied land. The old man said: \"I have never seen our people being injured being treated the same as the comrades. The district head even came to see me. I am fifty-eight years old and I have never seen such a good army. In my life, I have finally seen good people.\" And the government has become the leader and protector of the people in the war. When houses are destroyed, the government immediately allocates public housing to them. The injured are sent to the hospital, with thirty-five yuan per day provided. Those with financial difficulties are also given sorghum. For those killed by artillery fire, the government buys coffins and buries them, and also provides families with a condolence payment of one thousand yuan and one hundred jin of sorghum, as well as a long-term pension certificate. Now, in order to solve the problem of everyone's vegetables, temporary cooperatives have been organized in each district, using soybeans to sprout bean sprouts and make tofu. District cadres investigate the beans and oil stored in various stores throughout the city. With the consent of the merchants, they sell them to those in need and turn the money earned over to the stores. In this fully organized war, two newspapers are published in the city, one is the mimeographed *Fighting Siping Street* for the troops, and the other is the typeset *News Bulletin* for the people. The latter newspaper sells three thousand copies. It is inconvenient for the people to go out in the artillery fire, so the district cadres deliver the newspapers to their doors. These heroic workers often do not sleep for several nights, and they are for the people and closely with the people. The people of Siping Street said: \"Defeat them, let them see, and don't let them in!\" On the other hand, those prisoners of war who are tired of war are saying: \"We have crossed over. Among the people we have visited, we found that they like to say: From what time did I come over, or 'From what time did I lay down my gun?'\"\n    Once, a symposium of prisoners of war was held in the war political department. A young platoon leader said: \"At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, in order to save the country from danger, I left my fairly wealthy family and enthusiastically went to serve in the army. I never expected to be forced to fight in a civil war...!\" As he spoke, he cried. At this time, a battalion commander named Guo Chaonan, from Qinghua County, Henan, suddenly stood up with tears streaming down his face and said loudly: \"Report to the chairman, today I have woken up from a big dream and realized that I was wrong in the past. I know that the responsibility for the civil war does not lie with the Communist Party, but with those reactionaries.\" At this time, he excitedly shouted: \"Support the Democratic Allied Army who has made contributions to the liberation of the Northeast!\" The whole audience was moved. Then, he sincerely said: \"I know that I do not meet the conditions to join the Communist Party, but I am willing to further understand and work hard, and I hope to be a Communist Party member in the future.\" He cried and went to the rear hospital for recuperation with tears.\n    It is not easy to go from darkness to light. The reactionaries have tried various methods to make their soldiers stupid.\n    The New First Army was initially so arrogant and swaggered into the Northeast, but there is only one problem that the Kuomintang authorities cannot solve, that is, after the war, the officers can no longer preserve their deception. The soldiers know that the other side is not bandits, because there is no place in the world where there are such bandits: prisoners are not buried alive or skinned, but receive warmth. In the more than twenty days of the Siping Street War, the soldiers' emotions have undergone significant changes, on the one hand, decline and wavering; on the other hand, rising and firming. The soldiers of the New First Army began to secretly hide the leaflets of the Democratic Allied Army in their close-fitting pockets, and secretly took them out to read during breaks in the fighting.\n    When I arrived at the front, I saw a large cart, sending a dozen prisoners of war back, full of officials, each receiving cigarettes and travel expenses.\n    Not long ago, the reactionaries in Jinshanbao suffered a blow, and more than two hundred wounded soldiers were abandoned on the position. They wailed and groaned. Later, the comrades of the Democratic Allied Army carried them on stretchers to rooms covered with straw, fed them meals. Two days later, they sent them back in several carts—this made countless soldiers of the 71st Army understand the truth.\n    When returning by train, there were three gunners in gray American uniforms in the same carriage. They told me: \"We don't approve of fighting a civil war, that's all.\"\n    The heroic people of Siping Street will forever remain in my memory—when I looked from the carriage at the endless fertile fields of the Northeast on both sides, I admired the heroes, Siping Street is using its chest to resist artillery fire and poisonous arrows for the peace and democracy of the entire Northeast.

    "content": "【Special Report from This Newspaper】For the past half-month, the building at the east entrance of Huojie Street in Handan City has been frequently visited by friends. We – the workers of the People's Daily – have been happily and busily receiving our guests. \"Can the newspaper be published on time!\" \"The fifteenth is coming soon!\" This emotionally charged expectation and encouragement has turned into a force that urges us to actively prepare.\n\n　　Craftsmen are sweating, rushing to sculpt the plaques for \"People's Daily Office\" and \"Xinhua News Agency,\" with comrades from the Art Section of the Military Region Political Department personally participating and providing guidance. Soldiers, citizens, civil servants, and students often gather around the building to watch. Those busy writing upstairs see this enthusiastic scene, and a complex emotion of joy and gratitude wells up in their hearts. This public concern, the expectations of society, should be such a powerful encouragement for us young people!\n\n　　Party, government, and military leaders, as well as comrades from the Third Bureau and other organs, inquire about the preparations almost every day, giving instructions on everything and resolving difficulties. Comrade Panshi often gently reminds us: \"Don't let everyone's expectations down!\"\n\n　　The days are approaching, and it's already the fourteenth. From early morning, the typesetting room of the printing factory is fully mobilized, and editors and reporters run to the factory to proofread. The engraving workers are sweating profusely, meticulously carving the inscriptions of the leaders. No lunch, no nap. We work diligently for twelve hours. The Xinhua Bookstore has added many new customers, with 840 subscriptions placed on this day alone.\n\n　　The printing factory's machines are running all night. At eight o'clock on the morning of the fifteenth, the newspaper was published. The post office's bicycles rush to the door of the newspaper office. When they learned that the newspaper was still at the factory, they immediately rushed to the factory again. Soon, the street's reading areas were crowded with people.\n\n　　At ten o'clock, an inaugural tea party was held in the auditorium of Handan Middle School. Leaders, representatives of various organizations and groups, and the staff of this newspaper sat together, all with the same smiling faces. Commander Liu felt slightly unwell these days, but he was also very happy to come with Political Commissar Deng, examining the inaugural issue with double-lens glasses.\n\n　　Comrade Panshi took advantage of this opportunity to \"review the first issue of the newspaper,\" reporting on the preparations for this newspaper, the current situation, and the future plans. At the end of his report, he said: \"The publication of the newspaper today is primarily due to the spiritual and material encouragement and help from all aspects,\" because \"there are still many difficulties, and there may be inadequacies in taking care of all aspects. Please forgive us and hope for as much help as possible.\"\n\n　　Chairman Yang Xiufeng, with a beaming smile, mentioned several times that he was \"very happy.\" He said: The newspaper should publish more on region-wide major issues, such as the \"Yellow River Returning to its Old Course\" issue, which affects the lives of millions of people, and should be continuously and deeply disclosed. The first issue did this and \"did it well.\" He believes that in the future, we should accelerate transmission and strengthen communication work to give greater effect to the newspaper.\n\n　　Comrade Zhang Jichun first encouraged the comrades of the newspaper and news agency. He proposed that in the future, attention should be paid to \"helping the leadership,\" \"organizing struggles,\" and \"exchanging experiences\"; \"relying on everyone's strength to make the newspaper more perfect.\"\n\n　　Vice-Chairman Xing Zhaotang \"sincerely congratulated\" the publication of the newspaper and put forward many concrete suggestions, \"publicize our democratic movement and basic policies more.\" Pay attention to using diverse forms of publicity and improving writing skills.\n\n　　Comrades Ren Baige and Chen Feiqin also spoke. Comrade Ren Baige expressed gratitude for the publication of this spiritual food. Indeed, everyone needs it, and before the meeting and during the breaks in the speeches, wasn't everyone quietly reading it? But how can we make it even better? In addition to thanking everyone for taking the time to attend, Comrade Panshi finally reiterated \"please provide opinions at any time in the future and provide more help.\"\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n人民日报  Rénmín Rìbào (People's Daily)\n邯郸市  Hándān Shì (Handan City)\n火街东口  Huǒjiē Dōngkǒu (East Entrance of Huojie Street)\n新华通讯社  Xīnhuá Tōngxùnshè (Xinhua News Agency)\n军区政治部艺术科  Jūnqū Zhèngzhìbù Yìshùkē (Art Section of the Military Region Political Department)\n磐石  Pánshí\n刘司令员  Liú Sīlìngyuán (Commander Liu)\n邓政委  Dèng Zhèngwěi (Political Commissar Deng)\n邯郸中学  Hándān Zhōngxué (Handan Middle School)\n杨秀峰  Yáng Xiùfēng\n黄河归故  Huáng Hé Guī Gù (Yellow River Returning to its Old Course)\n张际春  Zhāng Jìchūn\n邢肇棠  Xíng Zhàotáng\n任白戈  Rèn Bái gē\n陈斐琴  Chén Fěiqín\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 一个欢快的茶会  庆祝本报创刊  磐石同志再三要求大家多帮助\n\n1946-05-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　一个欢快的茶会\n    庆祝本报创刊\n    磐石同志再三要求大家多帮助\n    【本报特写】半个月来，邯郸市火街东口的大楼经常被朋友们所访问。我们——人民日报的工作者，愉快而忙碌的接待着自己的客人。“大报能按时出版吧！”“十五号快到了！”这种情感洋溢的期望与鼓励，变成督促我们积极筹备的力量。\n    匠人们流着汗水，赶塑“人民日报馆”、“新华通讯社”的门额，军区政治部艺术科的同志们亲自参加指导。军人、市民、公务员、学生们经常围着大楼伫足而观。在楼上忙于编写的人们看到这种热烈的情形，心中泛起一种欢欣感激的复杂情绪。这群众的关心，社会的期望，对于我们这些青年人，该是多么有力的鼓舞呢！\n    党政军首长及三局等机关的同志们几乎每天询问筹备的情况，指示一切，解决困难。磐石同志常常这么轻轻的提醒着：“不要辜负大家的期望啊！”\n    日子一天天的逼近了，已经到了十四号。印刷厂排字房从清晨就全体动员，编辑记者们跑到工厂里当校对。刻字工人汗流满面，精雕首长的题词。午饭不吃，午觉不睡。一直忙碌了十二个钟头。新华书店新添了许多顾客，这一天订报的有八百四十份之多。\n    印刷厂的机器通宵劫动着。十五日上午八点钟，报纸出版了。邮局的自行车跑到报馆的门前，他们知道了报纸还在工厂时，立刻又向工厂驰去。不久，街头的阅报处挤满了人。\n    十点钟，在邯郸中学礼堂举行创刊典礼茶会。首长们、各机关团体的代表和本报的工作人员坐在一起，大家浮着一个相同的笑脸。刘司令员身体近日稍感不适，但也很高兴地和邓政委一起来了，用两重眼镜端详着创刊号。\n    磐石同志乘着这个“检阅第一期报纸”的机会，把本报筹备的经过，现在的情况和将来的计划报告了一下，他在报告的结尾说：“报纸能在今天出版，首先要感谢各方面精神上、物质上的鼓励与帮助”，因为“现在仍有许多困难，对各方面可能有照顾不周的地方，请原谅。并希望尽可能多多帮助。”\n    杨秀峰主席满面笑容，几次提到自己“很高兴”。他说：大报应该多多登载全区性的大问题，例如关系几百万人生命的“黄河归故”问题，就该连续、深刻的披露。第一期这样作了，“作得很好”。他认为今后应该加速传递，加强通讯工作，以发挥报纸更大的效果。\n    张际春同志首先把报纸及通讯社的同志鼓励了一番。提出今后要注意“帮助领导”、“组织斗争”、“交流经验”；“依靠大家的力量，把报纸搞得更完善些”。\n    邢肇棠副议长对报纸的出版，“竭诚祝贺”，并提出许多具体意见，“多宣传我们的民主运动和基本政策”。注意在宣传上，采用多种多样的形式，提高文字技术。\n    任白戈、陈斐琴等同志都说了话。任白戈同志感谢这个精神食粮的出版。的确，大家都很需要它，在开会之前及讲话的间隙中，每个人不是都在静静的读着它吗？但是，怎样才能把它办得更好些呢？磐石同志最后除对大家拨冗莅会表示感谢外，又再三提出“请以后随时提示意见，多多帮助”。"

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Today's \"Congtai\"\n    A Record of the Mobile Clinic of the Border Region Health Bureau\n    Zhan Chao\n\n    The \"Congtai\" in the northeast corner of Handan's urban and rural area is said to be the site of Zhao Wuling King's palace during the Warring States period. For these few small mounds and pavilions, countless literati and scholars have expended their ink, and countless common people have exhausted their blood and sweat. After the Japanese occupied Handan, the pseudo-county magistrate Yang Shuji was even more \"elegant\" and vigorously carried out construction, expanding and renovating it into \"Congtai Park.\" It is said that the old people in the four suburbs of the city had to bear five or six months of labor service for this, and the fat and money squeezed from them were countless. In the end, apart from a few \"Yamato\" descendants and their lackeys wandering around \"Congtai\", ordinary people did not dare to visit. But today's \"Congtai\" has completely changed. It is not only a good farming place, but also a sacred place for saving lives, because it is home to the Border Region Health Bureau, which is in charge of the health affairs of 30 million people, and its affiliated mobile clinic, which directly serves the people of Handan.\n\n    The Health Bureau's mobile clinic has been in Handan \"Congtai\" for less than two months, but it has left many good stories among the masses. There was a carpenter named Hu Xiang in Beimenli who suddenly became seriously ill in March and almost died. His family was very poor, and his elderly mother cried all day. When the doctor from the mobile clinic learned about this, he took the initiative to go to his door and treat him for more than a month without pay. The carpenter is now not only able to eat and walk, but also able to do some light work. Another oil mill worker's wife had her \"yangshui\" (amniotic sac) broken for a whole day and night and still couldn't give birth. The pregnant woman and her family were extremely anxious, but they had no way to deal with it. Later, they heard that the public had a mobile clinic, so they quickly sent someone to \"Congtai\" for help. As a result, they received a satisfactory answer. Doctor Zhao rushed over overnight, and until late at night, Health Bureau Director Zhu and Section Chief Liu, upon hearing that it was indeed a difficult delivery, braved the heavy snow from \"Congtai\" to Xibei Nan Zhuang (it was the night of the heaviest snowfall in March) until the pregnant woman safely gave birth before leaving. Afterwards, they sent people every day to wash for the pregnant woman and baby until the pregnant woman was completely safe. Even so, the mobile clinic refused to accept any money for medicine from the worker.\n\n    If you go to \"Congtai,\" you will see a wooden sign at the entrance of the mobile clinic that says: \"Morning Clinic from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, Home Visits from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM.\" But you can also often see people looking for them outside of the specified time. These visitors are often patients with urgent illnesses or those who have traveled from afar. In such cases, the staff of the mobile clinic will put aside other things and treat them as quickly as possible. For example, the citizen Li Zhengyuan was tripped by a big cart, and the wheel crushed the flesh of one of his calves to pieces (fortunately, it didn't break the bone). In some places, the bone and flesh had separated. What a serious injury this was! And a lot of mud and dirt had been pressed inside. When he was carried to the mobile clinic, it was still very early, but Section Chief Liu of the Medical Administration Section did not hesitate to get out of bed and perform surgery on him. Now Li Zhengyuan still sits on a stretcher and goes to \"Congtai\" every day to change his dressing. Every time he goes home with even greater joy, he often says this: \"With the doctors of the Eighth Route Army, my life has been saved.\" Indeed, at the beginning, not only Li Zhengyuan himself, but even his relatives and neighbors were worried about his leg, and even his life. But now, under the responsible treatment of the mobile clinic, his leg is growing new skin at the fastest speed.\n\n    \"Congtai\" - now such a beloved place, dozens of people go there every day, occasionally including farmers who come to see a doctor from 30 or 40 miles away. It reminds people of the scene of villagers going to temple fairs. On the desk of the mobile clinic, I saw such statistics: In April, a total of 935 patients were diagnosed and treated, home visits were made four or five times, 170 people came for examinations, and medicines worth more than 10,100 yuan were provided for free treatment. It is said that this number is not yet complete. In addition, in terms of epidemic prevention, in April they cooperated with general hospitals and others to vaccinate more than 4,200 people (mostly children) in the urban and suburban areas. The number of elementary school teachers who were trained in vaccination surgery and given vaccines to take back to their schools is not included.\n\n    At dusk, I left the Health Bureau and was about to go to the Citizen's Association in Beimenli when I met an elderly man at the door. He pointed to the Health Bureau's building and said, \"Did you just come from 'Dingjia Temple'?\" I nodded. Then, he enthusiastically narrated the great changes that had taken place in this short period of time. He said: That place used to be home to special agent assassination agencies. After the democratic government came, the black guns of the heartless monks, what's-his-name, Ciyun, Zhiyuan, who received enemy allowances, Guo Caiqin's (pseudo-Jinan Dao Communist Suppression Commander) and Guo Huamin's (pseudo-Self-Defense Regiment Leader) confidants, occupied people's land, and raped women were also searched out, and the occupied land was returned to the people to farm. Now it has been replaced by the Health Bureau's mobile clinic, which saves lives. It's really good, really good. After a short pause, he asked me: \"I heard that they are going to build a hospital there, is that true?\" I said \"It's true\" and relayed what Health Bureau Director Zhu had said: Chairman Yang is very concerned about this matter and has specially allocated 110,000 yuan for construction, and also said that as long as it is beneficial to the people, it is worth spending more money. I also told him that when I came, Director Zhu and the others were planning the site near \"Dingjia Temple\" and expected to complete it in three months. At that time, it could accommodate several times more patients than the mobile clinic. The old man was overjoyed, but then said with a sigh: \"Young man, do you know who built the earthen mountain on the shore of Hou Lake?\" He pointed in the direction of \"Congtai\" and asked me. I shook my head to indicate that I didn't know. He then continued: \"That was built by Yang Zhaoji. He and the Japanese and his concubines thought in the lake-center pavilion that they should build a mountain by the lake so that they could climb up and view the scenery of the lake after boating. His thought was not important, but the people had to bear tens of thousands of workers….\" Then he sighed and said: \"Alas! Young man, think about it, in the past, how many times was the construction of 'Congtai' for the people?? Only now has the world changed, and everything is based on the people, which is true democracy, and the same is true for repairing 'Congtai'.\" After he muttered to himself for a while, he turned to me again: \"Our Chairman Yang has a truly high vision, 'Congtai' is really a perfect place to recuperate!\" Under the setting sun, looking into the distance at a lake with willows, I thought: Ancient \"Congtai,\" now is the time of your rebirth.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    China\n邯郸    Handan\n赵武灵王  Zhao Wulingwang\n日本人  Japanese\n杨书基  Yang Shuji\n大和    Yamato\n胡祥    Hu Xiang\n北门里  Beimenli\n赵医生  Doctor Zhao\n朱局长  Director Zhu\n刘科长  Section Chief Liu\n西南北庄  Xibei Nan Zhuang\n李正元  Li Zhengyuan\n刘科长  Section Chief Liu\n八路军  Eighth Route Army\n杨主席  Chairman Yang\n定家寺  Dingjia Temple\n郭采芹  Guo Caiqin\n冀南道剿共司令 Jinan Dao Communist Suppression Commander\n郭化民  Guo Huamin\n自卫团长  Self-Defense Regiment Leader\n慈云    Ciyun\n志远    Zhiyuan\n杨肇基  Yang Zhaoji\n后湖    Hou Lake\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 今日的“丛台”  记边区卫生局流诊所\n展潮\n1946-05-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　今日的“丛台”\n    记边区卫生局流诊所\n    展潮\n    邯郸城厢东北角的“丛台”，据说是战国时代赵武灵王的遗址。为了这几个小土阜和亭榭，历来不知费去多少文人雅士的笔墨，更不知耗尽了多少老百姓的血汗。日本人占领邯郸后，伪县长杨逆书基更是“雅兴”勃发，大兴土木，扩修而成“丛台公园”。听说城四郊的老百姓，为此得整整负担五六个月的劳役，被榨去的脂膏钱更是无法统计。到头来，“丛台”除了几个“大和”子孙和他的走卒们在游荡外，普通老百姓是不敢问津的。可是今日的“丛台”，一切全变了，这里不仅是个好的农作场，更是一个救人活命的圣地，因为这里住着主持三千万人民卫生事宜的边区卫生局，以及它所附属直接服务于邯郸群众的流动诊疗所。\n    卫生局流诊所迁来邯郸“丛台”，才不到两个月，却在群众中留下不少的佳话。北门里有个木匠叫胡祥，三月间突然得重病，几乎死去，家里又很穷，急得他年老的母亲整天啼哭，这事被流诊所的医生知道了，自动上门，义务地替他治疗了一个多月，这个木匠现在已不仅能吃饭走动，还能作些轻微的劳作。另外一个油精厂工人，老婆“羊水”（衣包水）破后一昼一夜，还不能分娩，产妇和家人都焦急得不得了，但又毫无办法，后来听说公家有个流诊所，连忙派人去“丛台”求助，结果他们得到满意的答复，赵医生连夜赶去，而且直至深夜，卫生局朱局长和刘科长，听说确系难产，又冒着大雪从“丛台”赶到西南北庄（那是三月下雪最大的一夜），直至产妇安全地分娩后才走，过后每天还派人去替产妇与婴儿洗涤，待产妇完全安全时为止。虽然是这样，流诊所却拒绝接受这个工人的分文药费。\n    你要是去“丛台”，老远便会看到流诊所门口一块木牌上的字：“上午九时至十二时门诊，下午一时至三时出诊”。可是你也常常可以看到，不断有人在规定的时间外去找他们，而这一类来客又多是有急病或是远地赶来的病人，遇到这种情况，流诊所的工作人员便会将其他事情搁下，尽速地为他们医治。例如市民李正元被大车绊倒了，车轮把他一只小腿上的肉压得稀烂（幸亏没有压断骨头），好些地方骨和肉都脱离了关系了，这是一个多么严重的创伤啊！而且里面还压进去很多泥土和脏东西。当他被抬到流诊所时，天还很早，医政科刘科长却毫不犹豫地连忙从床上爬起来替他动手术。现在李正元每天还坐着担架到“丛台”换药，每当他带着更大的喜悦回家的时候，他常好说这样一句话：“有了八路军的医生，我这辈子得救了”。的确是这样，开始的时候，不反李正元自己，连他的亲属邻里都曾为他的腿，乃至于生命耽忧过，可是现在在流诊所负责的治疗下，他的腿正以最快的速度在生长着新的肌肤。\n    “丛台”——现在是这么一个令人喜爱的地方，每天总有几十个人朝那里去，其中间或还有从三四十里赶来看病的农民。使人想起乡下人赶庙会的情景。在流诊所的桌子上，我看到这样的统计数字：四月份共诊治九百三十五个病人，出诊四五次，来检查病的一百七十名，又义务治疗所用的药，计一万零一百多元。据说这个数还不够完全。此外，他们在防疫工作上，四月份与大家医院等合作，替市区及市郊群众（多是小孩）施种牛痘，共四千二百余人。经他们训练种痘手术，发给痘苗给小学教员回去种的，还没有计算在内。\n    黄昏时，我离开卫生局，正要到北门里的市民会去，在门口却遇到一位老年人，他指着卫生局的房子说：“你才从‘定家寺’来？”我点点头，随后，便是他眉飞色舞地在叙述着这短时期内的大变化了，他说：那里原先住着特务暗杀机关，民主政府来后，把那几个领敌人津贴的汉奸郭采芹（伪冀南道剿共司令）郭化民（伪自卫团长）的心腹、霸占民地、强奸民女的主事僧叫什么慈云、志远的黑枪也搜出来了，还把霸地归还老百姓种。现在却换的是救人活命的卫生局流诊所，真好，真好。稍停，他又问我：“听说还要在那里立医院，是真的吗”？我说“是真的”，并且把卫生局朱局长谈的话转告他：杨主席对这件事很关心，特别拨了十一万块钱建筑，还说只要对老百姓有利，多花点钱也值得。我又告诉他我来时朱局长他们正在“定家寺”附近计划着院址，预计三个月可以修成，到时候可以收容比流诊所好几倍的病人。老年人喜形于色，但又带着感叹的说：“老弟，你知道后湖岸上那个土山是谁修的吗？”他指着“丛台”那个方向问我，我摇摇头表示不知道，他便接上说：“那是杨肇基修的，他跟日本人跟姨太太们在湖心亭里想，该在湖边起一座山，好在游罢湖后登上去观观湖里的风光，他这一想不要紧，老百姓却得负担上万的工……。”接着他慨叹地说：“唉！老弟，你想想看，过去有那一次修筑‘丛台’是为了老百姓？？只有现在世道变了，事事都以民为主，这才是真正的民主，就以修‘丛台’来说也是一样”。他近乎自语地说了一回之后，又转来向我：“咱们杨主席见识真高，‘丛台’真是一个顶适宜于养病的地方啦！”夕阳下，远望着一片湖光柳色，我想：古老的“丛台”，现在是你新生的时候了。"

    "content": "He Yingqin's Lies Deceive People\n    Trying to Cover Up Conspiracy to Arrange Civil War\n    Xinhua News Agency Lists Facts to Refute\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th] Xinhua News Agency reporter refutes He Yingqin's remarks, stating: He Yingqin's remarks at a press conference in Nanjing on the 9th fabricate facts, speak nonsense, and attempt to cover up the conspiracy of the Kuomintang reactionaries to launch a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas, and to slander the Communist troops who faithfully implemented the ceasefire agreement, in order to create an excuse for their re-launching of a full-scale civil war. In order to expose this civil war expert's deceptive lies, we hereby refute them based on the facts as follows:\n\n    (1) He Yingqin's so-called \"sneak attack on Nantong\" by the Communist army is entirely a shameless slander. The county towns of Wuwei, Liuhe, Jingjiang, Haimen, Taixing, etc. on the north bank of the Yangtze River, and the towns of Xingren, Guanyinshan, Xiaohai, Changle, Batoumen, Liuqi, etc. near Nantong, were all liberated by the New Fourth Army from the hands of the Japanese invaders in August and September of last year. Later, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a large-scale offensive against the Central China liberated areas, and took advantage of the enemy to occupy Haimen on September 10th, occupy Wuwei on the 26th, occupy Taixing on December 31st, and then seize Jingjiang on January 2nd of this year, and recapture Liuhe on the 9th. After the ceasefire order was announced, the reactionaries went back on their word and continued their offensive actions, especially their attacks along the Yangtze River were the most active. In the Liuhe, Jiangdu, Taizhou, Rugao, Nantong, Haimen, and Qidong areas alone, forty-three towns were occupied—the six towns of Xingren, Changle, etc., were forcibly occupied by the Kuomintang 49th Army's 105th Division's 314th Regiment and 315th Regiment, as well as Zhu Tingzhi's puppet Nantong security team, and Zhao Fuxiang's puppet Haimen security team, on April 16th. Under the demand of the local people, the New Fourth Army had no choice but to rise up in self-defense, giving the invading army the punishment it deserved, and on the 26th, it recovered the above-mentioned six towns. More than five hundred Kuomintang soldiers were sacrificed in vain, and more than six hundred surrendered their weapons. Now, the army commander, Wang Tiehan, has personally led a large army to Nantong, and eight warships have been continuously transporting military supplies and troops to Xieqiao in Jingjiang and Tianshenggang on the Yangtze River coast. Recently, the New Fourth Army captured a Kuomintang military scout, Chen Yulian, in the Qihai area of ​​Central Jiangsu. According to his confession: the Kuomintang has decided to use the 21st Army as the main force, and use the four brigades of Zhang Bangsu (alias Zhang Aliu), a famous puppet bandit in Pudong in the past, to jointly attack Qidong. The 88th Army's New 21st Division and 62nd Division suddenly occupied the county seat of Xiao County on April 27th, which is also one of the major offensive actions.\n\n    He Yingqin also fabricated a \"log\" of the reorganization and movement of the \"Eighth Column of the Central China Field Army of the Communist Party.\" This absurd fabrication is precisely to cover up the fact that the reactionaries violated the agreement and secretly transported troops to the northern Jiangsu area. On the north bank of the Yangtze River, from Nanjing to the mouth of the Yangtze River, a 300-kilometer line, the Kuomintang has five armies stationed. Except for the 74th and 25th Armies which arrived in the Nanjing and Jiangdu areas before the ceasefire, the remaining 49th, 100th, and 21st Armies were all secretly transported here after the ceasefire order. Currently, the Kuomintang army surrounding the area east of the Jinpu Railway, south of the Longhai Railway, and north of the Yangtze River, has fourteen armies, forty-one divisions, and five hundred thousand troops. He Yingqin still thinks this is not enough, and shouts that \"there are too few National Army troops stationed,\" which is a self-admission that he wants to gather more troops to carry out a larger-scale encirclement and suppression.\n\n    Regarding the Central Plains conflict, He Yingqin has exhausted his ability to fabricate rumors and distortions. He said: \"There is no conflict in the Central Plains at all,\" \"The Communist army saw that the National Army in the east was empty, so it expanded greatly eastward from its original station, as if it wanted to flee to the southern section of the Jinpu Railway.\" He also falsely accused our army of \"being located south of Guangshan at the time of the ceasefire, and after the ceasefire order, moving to Popihe, Huwan, Dingyuandian, Xuanhuadian, Qingxingdian, and Shigangdian,\" and \"recently expanding its territory eastward.\" Everyone knows that in last year's Double Tenth Agreement, the Communist Party expressed its intention to withdraw the Central Plains Military Region troops to the liberated area north of the Longhai Railway, but Hu Zongnan immediately strictly blockaded the Yellow River coast with a large army, and divided seven \"suppression zones\" and launched a large-scale offensive. Our army was forced to withdraw south, and the Kuomintang army continued to pursue and surround, attempting to annihilate our Central Plains troops in the Dahongshan and Siwangshan areas. Until the ceasefire order on January 10, the main force of the Central Plains troops began to transfer to Xixian (December 28), Guangshan (January 6), and the Daxiaowushan area east of the Pinghan Railway. After the ceasefire order was issued, the Kuomintang reactionaries intensified their offensive against us, occupied Xixian on the 11th and Guangshan on the 14th. Our main force was forced to transfer to areas such as Xuanhuadian and Dingyuandian (these locations were originally stationed by our army). Up to now, the Yuxi and Yunan liberated areas, our army has been forced to completely withdraw, and most of the bases in Dahongshan, Siwangshan, Honghu, etc. have been lost. Our Central Plains main force is surrounded in the narrow area around Xuanhuadian. This is the truth about the Central Plains troops \"greatly developing eastward\" and \"expanding territory\" that He Yingqin said. He Yingqin also clamored that \"the National Army in the east is empty.\" May I ask, the Kuomintang army used eleven armies, twenty-six divisions, and 300,000 troops in the Central Plains to arrange the civil war. Is this called \"empty\"? Furthermore, the Kuomintang authorities deployed the 47th, 41st, and 72nd Armies, three armies, seven divisions (excluding local troops), and more than 80,000 people on the Luoshan, Guangshan, Gaocheng, Jingfu, Huang'an, and Macheng lines. Recently, the 58th Army near Suxian was also transferred and moved towards Fuyang and Taihe. Is this called \"empty\"? As for \"there is no conflict in the Central Plains at all,\" it is even more self-deception. From the ceasefire order to the end of April, the Kuomintang army launched 366 offensives against the Central Plains region, using a total force of more than 650,000, occupying 1,201 towns and villages. More than 7,500 of our soldiers were wounded, killed, or captured. Since May, there has been no day without offensives and no day without battles. This has been seen in our daily dispatches, and the facts are all there. How can it be denied! While He Yingqin is desperately denying the conflict, he is also fabricating the nonsense that the Communist army is \"expanding its territory eastward\" as an excuse to create a civil war, and trying to continue to transfer troops and gradually implement its plan to encircle and annihilate more than 60,000 Communist troops in the Central Plains under the clever rhetoric of \"the National Army in the east is empty\" and \"the National Army has to send troops to guard against all eventualities,\" which is extremely sinister!\n\n    (3) He Yingqin fantastically fabricated a so-called \"number\" of Communist troops attacking the National Army and \"number\" of occupied towns from January 14th to the end of April, and asked his assistant Cao Shizheng to make a \"supplementary explanation,\" listing 24 county towns occupied by the Communist army. The purpose of this supplementary explanation was to make up for the flaw in He Yingqin's speech that he could not provide specific place names, but the result just exposed his master's flaws. Among the 24 cities listed by Cao Shizheng, Boshan and Zichuan were liberated from the enemy and puppet hands by the Shandong Eighth Route Army as early as August 23rd and 25th last year. Later, the Kuomintang authorities instructed the Japanese troops stationed in Shandong, the 43rd Unit, to \"recover\" these two cities on September 12th and 18th. On December 6th, we recaptured these two cities again; on the 8th, they were occupied by the puppet army reorganized by the Kuomintang. Before the ceasefire order was announced, we recovered them for the third time, and have since maintained them in our hands. Yidu was liberated by our Shandong Eighth Route Army on August 23rd last year, and was \"recovered\" by the Dragon Book Unit of the 12th Brigade of the Japanese Garrison under the instruction of the Kuomintang on September 9th. On the 15th, it was recovered by us again, and has since maintained it in our hands. Anze was recovered by our army from the enemy as early as May 12th last year. On August 18th, Yan Xishan's troops once peeked into it, but were repelled by us. The situation in Shuangbao, Hunchen, Mengxian, Fushan, Zuoyun, and Yutian is roughly similar. They were all first liberated by our army, then once occupied by the Kuomintang army, and finally recovered by our army. As for the county towns of Yicheng, Anci, Wen'an, Yixian, and Wencheng, they were recovered by our army from the enemy and puppets during the period from May to the end of last year, and no soldier of the Kuomintang army was ever seen. Even more absurd is saying that we occupied Yingkou, Fengrun, Quwo and other cities. It was found that Yingkou was occupied by the Kuomintang 71st Army's 88th Division on April 2nd, and is now occupied by the Kuomintang 60th Army's 184th Division. Fengrun was recovered by our Jidong troops from the enemy and puppets on September 26th last year, and was occupied by the Kuomintang 94th Army's 5th Division on January 12th this year, and is still occupied by the Kuomintang 94th Army's 41st Division. Quwo was originally recovered by the Taiqiu troops of the Eighth Route Army one day before the ceasefire order was announced, and was occupied by Yan's army after the ceasefire order was announced, and is still controlled by Yan Xishan's Pioneer Column. The Central News Agency is still constantly falsely accusing us of besieging Quwo, and now it is said that we occupied it. Isn't this a blatant lie! In short, the cities listed by He were all originally liberated by the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army from the enemy and puppets, and then occupied by the Kuomintang army. Some of them were seized before the ceasefire order took effect, and there are still many cities occupied by them. He's so-called \"offensive after the ceasefire meeting\" is exactly what he himself is doing. Not only that, according to available materials, from the ceasefire meeting to the end of April, the Kuomintang army launched 3,511 large and small offensives against the liberated areas, using a total force of 2,582,764 people, forcibly occupying 2,077 of our villages and towns.

He Yingqin has recently been arranging the civil war everywhere, and after returning to Nanjing, he has repeatedly issued speeches, arbitrarily slandering the Chinese Communist Party, obviously conducting public opinion mobilization for his planned civil war cause.

The original telegram is as follows:\n\n    To Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Zhang of the Democratic League, the Political Consultative Conference Subcommittee, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Provincial, Municipal, and County Councils of all provinces and cities, the Fellow Countrymen Associations of JiluYu Provinces in various places, all legal entities, and compatriots across the country: Since the proposal to return the Yellow River to its old course, the people of all counties along the river in this region have been shocked and frightened. In addition to providing comfort in many ways, this government has sent representatives to negotiate with the Yellow River Commission stationed in Kaifeng and to participate in the survey by the Yellow River Commission survey team, resulting in the clear decision on April 15 to first dredge the river and restore the dikes before damming the breach in the Yellow River at Huayuankou – the Heze Agreement. However, after this government began preparations in accordance with the agreement, the Kuomintang authorities first instructed the Central News Agency to spread rumors, deliberately distorting the content of the agreement, then ordered the Yellow River Commission to speed up the damming of the breach, and are now actively preparing to close the breach and release water. This is closely related to the Kuomintang's active preparations to re-ignite the civil war and is actually part of the Kuomintang's military conspiracy to attack our JiluYu region, forcing approximately 12 million people in our entire border area to suffer the tragedy of civil war and floods again. This government, acting on behalf of the people, in addition to sending representatives to continue negotiating with the Kuomintang authorities and the Yellow River Commission to seek compromise, also issues a sincere and urgent appeal to the nation. We earnestly request all democratic parties, legal entities, fellow countrymen associations of JiluYu provinces in various places, and people of justice from all walks of life to urgently take effective measures for the sake of the lives of 12 million people in the JiluYu border region and to stop the civil war and maintain peace, so as to stop this disastrous and evil scheme of the Kuomintang reactionaries that harms the country and the people. This government is determined to lead the people of the entire region to fight to the death to achieve the implementation of the Heze Agreement. If the Kuomintang authorities still do not repent, the people of this region will not sit idly by and wait to be drowned, but will rise up to build dikes and save themselves. Compelled by circumstances, it is difficult to remain silent. This is reported to you. JiluYu Administrative Office Director Dong Junyi, Deputy Director Jia Xinzai, respectfully.\n\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Heze, 12th] The JiluYu Daily published an article on the 8th titled \"Mobilize to Build Dikes and Save Ourselves,\" which stated in part: The Heze Agreement, which stipulates that the dikes be restored before the breach is dammed, is a fair conclusion and correct policy obtained from on-site surveys by Chinese hydraulic engineers and the Liberated Area government, and has therefore won the support of the broad masses of the people in the Liberated Areas. However, the plan of the Kuomintang authorities is exactly the opposite. They not only want to impose the Yellow River disaster on the people of the Liberated Areas, but also want to cleverly blame the Liberated Area government, using accusations of \"being able to act but not acting\" and \"deliberately obstructing\" to cover up their crimes. Now the Kuomintang is planning a huge military conspiracy, planning to take advantage of the Yellow River's flooding to launch a large-scale invasion of the Liberated Areas. We must not be paralyzed. We must recognize that the Kuomintang authorities, who are vicious, insidious, and inherently rogue-like, are capable of doing anything. The situation is already very clear. The Kuomintang authorities are now stepping up the damming project at Huayuankou and are about to use the Yellow River to drown the soldiers and civilians of our North China Liberated Areas. The only way out is to implement self-salvation. We must block the water from coming north. The people of the entire border area, regardless of rich or poor, male or female, old or young, must all mobilize to build dikes and save ourselves, and not allow the Yellow River to flood in. Time is already very urgent. We call on the people of the entire region to urgently mobilize. Building dikes and saving ourselves is the only way out. We demand that compatriots across the country and people around the world uphold justice, stop the Kuomintang authorities' vicious conspiracy, immediately stop damming the breach, and implement the Heze Agreement.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n中共    Zhonggong (Chinese Communist Party)\n毛主席  Mao Zhuxi (Chairman Mao)\n民主同盟  Minzhu Tongmeng (Democratic League)\n张主席  Zhang Zhuxi (Chairman Zhang)\n政协小组委员会  Zhengxie Xiaozu Weiyuanhui (Political Consultative Conference Subcommittee)\n联合国救济总署  Lianheguo Jiuji Zongshu (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration)\n冀鲁豫  JiluYu (Hebei-Shandong-Henan)\n黄河  Huang He (Yellow River)\n黄委会  Huang Wei Hui (Yellow River Commission)\n开封  Kaifeng\n荷泽  Heze\n中央社  Zhongyang She (Central News Agency)\n董君毅  Dong Junyi\n贾心斋  Jia Xinzai\n冀鲁豫日报  JiluYu Ribao (JiluYu Daily)\n花园口  Huayuankou\n华北解放区  Huabei Jiefangqu (North China Liberated Areas)\n荷泽协议  Heze Xieyi (Heze Agreement)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫行署对国民党堵口阴谋  通电全国为民请命  倘国民党仍不悔悟决奋起筑堤自救\n\n1946-05-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀鲁豫行署对国民党堵口阴谋\n    通电全国为民请命\n    倘国民党仍不悔悟决奋起筑堤自救\n    【新华社荷泽十二日电】冀鲁豫行署以国民党反动派决心放水淹溺全区人民，顷特为民请命，致电全国，发出紧急呼吁。原电如下：\n    中共毛主席、民主同盟张主席，政协小组委员会、联合国救济总署、各省市县参议会、各地冀鲁豫三省同乡会、各法团暨全国同胞公鉴：黄河归故倡议以来，本区沿河各县群情惊骇，本府除多方抚慰外，并派代表与黄委会交涉驻开封商谈及黄委会勘察团之勘察而有四月十五日明确决议先浚河复堤而后堵口之荷泽协议，讵后当本府方面按照协议进行准备工作之际，国民党当局首先指使中央社造谣，故意歪曲协议内容，继则限令黄委会加紧堵口，现又积极准备合龙放水，此与目前国民党积极准备重新挑起内战密切有关，实为国民党向我冀鲁豫进攻之军事阴谋的一部分，逼使我全边约一千二百万人民重罹内战与洪水之惨祸。本府为民请命，除再派代表与国民党当局及黄委会委曲求全继续商谈外，并向全国发出诚恳的紧急呼吁，敢请各民主政党、法团、各地冀鲁豫三省同乡会及各界正义人士，为冀鲁豫边区一千二百万人民生命计，为制止内战维护和平计，共同急起，采取有效办法，制止国民党反动派此种祸国殃民之阴谋毒计。本府决率领全区人民，誓死力争荷泽协议之实现，倘国民党当局仍不默然悔悟，本区人民将不甘坐待淹毙，决奋起筑堤，挡水自救，实逼处此，难以缄默，特此电闻。冀鲁豫行署主任董君毅、副主任贾心斋叩。\n    【新华社荷泽十二日电】冀鲁豫日报八日以《动员起来筑堤自救》为题著论，略称：规定先复堤后堵口的荷泽协议，是中国水利工程师与解放区政府实地勘察所得的公正结论和正确方针，因而取得解放区广大人民的拥护。但国民党当局的计划却真正相反，他们不仅想将黄灾加诸解放区人民身上，更想巧妙地加罪于解放区政府，以“能为而不为”和“故意阻挠”的罪名以掩饰其罪恶，现国民党正在策划着一个巨大的军事阴谋，策划着随黄水之汜滥而向解放区大举进犯，我们不能麻痹，我们要认清毒辣阴险流氓成性的国民党当局是什么事都干得出来的。事情已经非常明白，国民党当局现正加紧进行在花园口的堵口工程，就要用黄河来淹死我华北解放区军民，只有实行自救，我们要阻水北来，全边区的人民不问贫富男女老幼，一齐动员起来，筑堤自救，不让黄水浸入。时间已经非常迫切，我们号召全区人民紧急动员起来，只有筑堤自救，才是出路。我们要求全国同胞，全世界人士，主持正义，制止国民党当局的毒辣阴谋，立即停止堵口，执行荷泽协议。"

    "content": "【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th】 Su Yu, Deputy Commander of the Central China Military Region, recently made a statement to a reporter from this agency here. Deputy Commander Su first pointed out that the Central China Liberated Area is currently on the eve of a large-scale offensive by the Nationalist army. After the ceasefire order of January 13th took effect, the Nationalist army successively occupied Baipu Town in Rugao, northern Jiangsu; Zhao Zhuang, Xi Ma Chang, Yanfang, Yangjiaqiao, Si Ma Town, and Daqiao Town in Taixian County; Sanhe Town, Tianbu Town, and Changle Town in Tonghai (Nantong-Haimen); Lingdian Town in Qidong and other places; Maodunzi, Chengqiao, Hengliangdian, and Donggou Town in Liuhe, northern Huainan; Leiguanji in Lai'an County; Chenjiagou and other places in Ganquan (newly established county seat); Tuoheji in Lingbi, northern Huai; Hao City in Wuhe County; Sanpuji in Sudong; Licanji, Zhanglou, Duanlou, Qianhou Ranfang, and Pengji in Xia County, and occupied Xiao County city and other places. Even after the Huaiyin Executive Group arrived in Central China for over a month, and after the No. 6 order explicitly ordering the restoration to the situation at 12:00 on January 13th had been issued for over half a month, they still blatantly occupied Xiaohai Town, Xingren Town, and Chenjiaqiao in Nantong, northern Jiangsu, and Dashengqiao and other places in Taixing. Furthermore, sneak attacks and harassment of the people are a daily occurrence. Wherever the Nationalist army goes, it burns, kills, rapes, and loots. Even Mr. Xu Haoquan, who reported the truth about Baipu to the Executive Group, and Mr. Sun Pingtian and Mr. Qian Sufan, who welcomed the Executive Group in Nantong, were brutally murdered by special agents. Now, the Nationalist reactionaries are still attempting to launch a nationwide civil war. Along the Yangtze River in Central China, the 49th Army in the Tong (Nantong) Hai (Haimen) Jing (Jiangyin) area, the 100th Army in the Liang Tai (Taizhou, Taixing) area, the 25th Army on the Yangzhou-Yizheng-Xiannvmiao line, the 74th Army on the Liuhe-Dongge line, the 21st Army in the Chongming-Nantong area, the 9th Army along the Jinpu Railway line in Pukou, Chuxian, Bengbu, and the 58th Army south of Suxian-Xuzhou, as well as the 98th and 28th Armies in Xuzhou-Haimen, are all awaiting orders to move out. Deputy Commander Su continued: The situation in the Central China Liberated Area is extremely serious now. The guns and cannons of the Nationalist army have been lined up, and at a single command, they will bombard us. We have done everything humanly possible. If we continue to yield, the only result will be to encourage the greed of the reactionaries. Now we can only endure the pain and implement self-defense. Only under the condition of resolutely implementing self-defense, and only after the offensive of the reactionaries is stopped, will the lives and property and the peaceful and democratic life of the 23 million people in the Central China Liberated Area be guaranteed. After the ceasefire, we have carried out peaceful construction in various aspects such as politics, economy, and culture. We have further promoted democracy, launched a strict and just movement to punish traitors, promoted rent and interest reduction, and provided disaster relief for the spring famine, repaired canal embankments, and built highways. Restoring transportation and other peaceful construction work will inevitably be hindered by the offensive of the Nationalist reactionaries. However, we must call on everyone to continue these construction efforts diligently, and not interrupt them because of the unreasonable provocations of the Nationalist reactionaries. Finally, Deputy Commander Su appealed to the people of the whole country, to all peace-loving and democratic people in the Nationalist Party, in the Nationalist army, calling on them to immediately oppose the civil war and stop the civil war.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n中国\tChina\n新华社\tXinhua News Agency\n延安\tYan'an\n华中军区\tCentral China Military Region\n粟裕\tSu Yu\n苏中\tSu Zhong\n如皋\tRugao\n白蒲镇\tBaipu Town\n泰县\tTaixian\n赵庄\tZhao Zhuang\n西马厂\tXi Ma Chang\n沿坊\tYanfang\n杨家桥\tYangjiaqiao\n嘶马镇\tSi Ma Town\n大桥镇\tDaqiao Town\n通海\tTonghai\n南通\tNantong\n海门\tHaimen\n三和镇\tSanhe Town\n天补镇\tTianbu Town\n长乐镇\tChangle Town\n启东\tQidong\n灵甸镇\tLingdian Town\n淮南\tHuainan\n六合\tLiuhe\n毛墩子\tMaodunzi\n程桥\tChengqiao\n横梁甸\tHengliangdian\n东沟镇\tDonggou Town\n来安\tLai'an\n雷官集\tLeiguanji\n甘泉\tGanquan\n陈家沟\tChenjiagou\n淮北\tHuai Bei\n灵壁\tLingbi\n沱河集\tTuoheji\n五河\tWuhe\n濠城\tHao City\n宿东\tSu Dong\n三铺集\tSanpuji\n夏邑\tXia Yi\n李璨集\tLicanji\n张楼\tZhanglou\n段楼\tDuanlou\n前后染房\tQianhou Ranfang\n彭集\tPengji\n萧县\tXiao County\n淮阴\tHuaiyin\n和字第六号命令\tOrder No. 6\n靖江\tJingjiang\n新港\tXingang\n徐浩泉\tXu Haoquan\n孙平天\tSun Pingtian\n钱素凡\tQian Sufan\n四十九军\t49th Army\n两泰\tLiang Tai\n泰州\tTaizhou\n泰兴\tTaixing\n一百军\t100th Army\n扬州\tYangzhou\n仪征\tYizheng\n仙女庙\tXiannvmiao\n廿五军\t25th Army\n六合东葛\tLiuhe Dongge\n七十四军\t74th Army\n崇明\tChongming\n二十一军\t21st Army\n津浦\tJinpu\n浦口\tPukou\n滁县\tChuxian\n蚌埠\tBengbu\n第九军\t9th Army\n宿县徐州\tSuxian-Xuzhou\n五十八军\t58th Army\n徐州海门\tXuzhou-Haimen\n九十八军\t98th Army\n二十八军\t28th Army\n国民党\tKuomintang (Nationalist Party)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华中国民党军集结待命进攻  粟裕呼吁国人立即制止  我已一再忍让，现在只有坚决实行自卫。\n\n1946-05-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华中国民党军集结待命进攻\n    粟裕呼吁国人立即制止\n    我已一再忍让，现在只有坚决实行自卫。\n    【新华社延安十二日电】华中军区粟副司令裕顷在此间对本社记者发表谈话，粟副司令首先指出，目前华中解放区正处于国民党军大规模进攻的前夜。国民党军在一月十三日停战令生效后，先后侵占我苏中如皋之白蒲镇，泰县之赵庄、西马厂、沿坊、杨家桥、嘶马镇、大桥镇，通（南通）海（门）之三和镇、天补镇、长乐镇，启东之灵甸镇等地；淮南六合之毛墩子、程桥、横梁甸、东沟镇，来安之雷官集、甘泉（新设县治）之陈家沟等地；淮北灵壁之沱河集，五河之濠城，宿东之三铺集，夏邑之李璨集、张楼、段楼、前后染房、彭集，并攻占萧县城等地。甚至在淮阴执行小组到达华中已逾一月，明令恢复一月十三日十二小时原状的和字第六号命令发出已逾半月的时候，还公然侵占我苏中南通之小海镇、兴仁镇、陈家桥，泰兴之大生桥等地。随后又侵占靖江之新港。至于偷袭民出扰，更无日无之。国民党军足迹所至，辄烧杀淫掠，甚至去执行小组报告白蒲实情的徐浩泉先生及南通欢迎执行小组的孙平天、钱素凡等先生，都遭了特务惨杀。现在国民党反动派还在企图发动全国性的内战，我华中沿江一带，通（南通）海（门）靖（江）地区的四十九军，两泰（泰州、泰兴）地区的一百军，扬州、仪征。仙女庙一线的廿五军，六合东葛一线的七十四军，崇明南通地区的二十一军，津浦沿线浦口、滁县蚌、埠一线的第九军，宿县徐州以南的五十八军，以及徐州海门的九十八军、二十八军，都已待命出动。粟副司令继称：现在华中解放区形势异常严重，国民党军的枪炮已经排好，一声号令，就会向我们轰击。我们已经做到仁至义尽的地步，如果我们再忍让，其结果只有促成反动派的贪欲。现在我们只有忍痛实行自卫，只有在坚决实行自卫的条件下，在反动派的进攻遭到阻止后，我华中解放区二千三百里的人民的生命财产与和平民主的生活才有保证。我们在停战以后，已进行政治、经济、文化等各方面的和平建设，我们更进一步的推行了民主，掀起了严正的惩奸运动，推行了减租减息，还救了春荒、修造运河堤岸、修筑公路。恢复交通等等，这一切和平建设的工作势必会因国民党反动派的进攻而受到阻挠。但是，我们要号召大家，这些建设工作仍然应该努力继续下去，不要因为国民党反动派无理挑衅而中断。最后，粟副司令向全国人民呼吁，向全国及国民党内、国民党军队内一切爱好和平民主的人士呼吁，要求他们立即反对内战，制止内战。"

    "content": "Our Army's Position on Siping Street Stands Firm as a Mountain\n    Kuomintang Troops Face Dilemma\n    Frontline Commanders and Fighters Firmly Believe: \"Siping Street Will Always Be Ours!\"\n    [New China News Agency, Siping Street, 13th dispatch] Our agency reporter Chen Yi reports: The defense of Siping Street has been going on for nearly four weeks. Thanks to the heroic resistance of our defending troops and the skillful maneuvers of our outer line troops, our army's position remains unshaken. The New First Army is now in a dilemma. Except for a炮战炮 battle between the two sides on the night of the 9th, when the Democratic Allied Army bombarded and destroyed one or two relatively prominent high red-roofed buildings of the Kuomintang army, the entire front has been in a stalemate in recent days. Although Zheng Dongguo, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security, personally commands the New First Army and supervises the battle at Shuangmiazi (40 li south of Siping Street), he cannot change this situation. The invading army is now facing difficulties in supply. Even sorghum rice is hard to come by. Soldiers are only given 20 yuan per day, but there is nothing to buy. They are looting beans from the people to satisfy their hunger. On the 8th, on the southeast front of Siping Street, a platoon leader even said to the defending soldiers of the Democratic Allied Army: \"Please don't shoot, I am willing to crawl over to talk to you.\" The defending soldiers generously allowed it. The platoon leader crawled over and asked: \"How long are you going to defend?\" The soldiers of the Democratic Allied Army replied: \"Until you stop attacking!\" The platoon leader crawled back dejectedly. The Democratic Allied Army has high morale. The commanders and fighters who are holding the front lines wrote to Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army: \"Siping Street will always be ours!\" The order in Siping Street is also extremely stable. The city gates have been opened, and residents can travel freely. Market transactions are carried out on time, and farmers from the surrounding countryside transport grain and vegetables. The Liaoxi and Liaobei Democratic Allied Army Frontline Headquarters have sent comfort groups carrying large quantities of goods to comfort the soldiers on the front lines. The New First Army is currently reorganizing its troops, ordering them to save ammunition as much as possible in preparation for future decisive battles. At the same time, they are strengthening the surveillance of the soldiers and waiting for reinforcements from Shenyang.\n\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\nPlaces:\n四平街\tSiping Street\n双庙子\tShuangmiazi\n沈阳\tShenyang\n辽西\tLiaoxi\n辽北\tLiaobei\n\nPeople:\n陈沂\tChen Yi\n郑洞国\tZheng Dongguo\n林彪\tLin Biao\n\nOrganizations:\n新华社\tXinhua News Agency\n国民党\tKuomintang\n民主联军\tDemocratic Allied Army\n东北保安副司令长官\tDeputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security\n新一军\tNew First Army\n辽西辽北民主联军前线指挥所  Liaoxi and Liaobei Democratic Allied Army Frontline Headquarters\n东北民主联军\tNortheast Democratic Allied Army\n\nEvents:\n四平街保卫战\tDefense of Siping Street\n\nTitles:\n东北保安副司令长官  Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security\n东北民主联军总司令\tCommander-in-Chief of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army\n\nSlogans:\n四平街永远是我们的\tSiping Street will always be ours\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 四平街我军阵地屹立如山  国民党军进退两难  前线指战员坚信：“四平街永远是我们的”！\n陈沂\n1946-05-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　四平街我军阵地屹立如山\n    国民党军进退两难\n    前线指战员坚信：“四平街永远是我们的”！\n    【新华社四平街十三日电】本社记者陈沂报导：四平街保卫战已接近四个星期，由于我守城部队的英勇抗击，外线部队的机巧运动，我军阵地仍屹立不动，现新一军已陷于进退两难的境地，除九日夜双方一度进行炮战，民主联军将国民党军比较突出之一二层高红屋阵地轰垮外，最近数日全线已呈胶着状态，虽有东北保安副司令长官郑洞国亲自指挥新一军，驻双庙子（四平街南四十里）督战，然也无法改变这一形势。现进犯军给养困难，高粱米也难得到，每日仅发给士兵二十元，但无物可买，向老百姓大抢豆子充饥。八日在四平街东南前线，竟有一排长向民主联军守军说：“请你们不要打枪，我愿爬到你那里说说。”守军即慨然允许，那排长爬来问：“你们到底要守到那天？”民主联军战士回答：“守到你们停止进攻为止！”排长仍颓丧的爬回去了。民主联军士气旺盛，坚持在最前线的指战员写信给东北民主联军林彪总司令说：“四平街永远是我们的！”四平街秩序亦极安定，城门业已开放，居民可以自由通行，市场交易按时进行，四乡农民运进粮食菜蔬。辽西辽北民主联军前线指挥所，均派慰劳团携带大批物品，慰劳阵地战士。现新一军正在一面整编部队，下令尽量节省弹药，以备将来决战，同时加强对士兵的监视，另方面等待沈阳方面增援。"

On the Longhai front, the Kuomintang army, to coordinate its \"encirclement and suppression\" of our Yu East Liberated Area, has simultaneously deployed forces along the Xuzhou-Kaifeng section of the Longhai Railway, dividing them into three routes to attack our area north of the Longhai Railway. Each route's troops began assembling on the 8th. The first route consists of a portion of the 68th Army stationed in Kaifeng, in coordination with local security regiments such as those of Ding Shuben and Wang Sanzhu, advancing north from Tianfeng to Qiubei. This unit reached Fengqiu on the 10th. The second route consists of a portion of the 50th Army stationed in Shangqiu, attacking north from that county towards Shanxian. The third route is advancing north from Dangshan towards Peixian and Fengxian. Six regiments of unknown designation arrived by train from the east on the 9th and disembarked at Dangshan. On the 9th and 10th, Kuomintang troops arriving by train from the west were seen disembarking at the Neihuang and Yejiagang stations and stationed at the Sezhuang station. Troops of the 137th Division and 84th Division have also been observed arriving in Xuzhou. Jiang Jiabin's unit (Huaibei Advance Fourth Column), stationed between Dangshan and Yucheng, is building fortifications on the south bank of the Ji-Huang River, awaiting an opportunity to attack. On the Pinghan line, the Kuomintang army has ordered its units stationed southeast of Qixian at Qimen, north of Qixian at Dacizhuang and Haogou, and east of Anyang at Liuyuan, Cuijiaqiao, and Xindianji to construct fortifications by company, building a deep network of bunkers by platoon and company. One-third of their forces, in coordination with local armed forces, are responsible for defense, while two-thirds are gathered and deployed, awaiting an opportunity to attack. The 40th Army in Anyang also began conducting attack and defense training on May 1st. The designation of the Yu North Traffic Police was announced cancelled on the 5th, and its original subordinates, Cheng Daosheng, Guo Qing, and other local teams, are all under the command of the 40th Army. Li Ying's unit in Anyang is rumored to be moving to Taiyang, southeast of Anyang. The Anyang bus station has been moved from Xiguan to Dongguan. Based on this situation, the Kuomintang army on the Pinghan line is about to launch an eastward attack on our Jilu-Yu Fourth Sub-district, with extremely obvious intentions.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n冀鲁豫区  Jilu-Yu Region\n陇海路  Longhai Railway\n平汉线  Pinghan Line\n豫东区  Yu East Region\n徐州  Xuzhou\n开封  Kaifeng\n六十八军  68th Army\n丁树本  Ding Shuben\n王三祝  Wang Sanzhu\n田封邱  Tianfeng Qiu\n封邱  Fengqiu\n商邱  Shangqiu\n五十军  50th Army\n单县  Shanxian\n砀山  Dangshan\n沛县  Peixian\n丰县  Fengxian\n内黄  Neihuang\n野鸡岗  Yejiagang\n瑟庄  Sezhuang\n一百三十七师  137th Division\n八十四师  84th Division\n蒋嘉宾  Jiang Jiabin\n淮北挺进第四纵队  Huaibei Advance Fourth Column\n淇县  Qixian\n淇门  Qimen\n大赐庄  Dacizhuang\n颢沟  Haogou\n安阳  Anyang\n柳圆  Liuyuan\n崔家桥  Cuijiaqiao\n辛店集  Xindianji\n四十军  40th Army\n程道生  Cheng Daosheng\n郭清  Guo Qing\n李英  Li Ying\n太阳  Taiyang\n西关  Xiguan\n东关  Dongguan\n第四分区  Fourth Sub-district\n国民党  Kuomintang\n冀黄河南岸  Ji-Huang River\n豫北交通警察  Yu North Traffic Police\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党军三路分兵  进犯陇海以北解放区\n\n1946-05-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党军三路分兵\n    进犯陇海以北解放区\n    【新华社荷泽十二日急电】军息：冀鲁豫区陇海、平汉沿线形势，随我六分区（豫东区）的形势变化，亦已紧张万分。陇海方面，国民党军队为配合其向我豫东解放区之“围剿”，同时于陇海路徐州至开封段部署为三路向陇海路以北我区进攻，各路部队已于八日开始集结。第一路为驻开封之六十八军一部，配合丁树本、王三祝等地方保安团，田封邱北进，该部十日已至封邱；第二路为驻商邱之五十军一部，自该县北犯单县；第三路自砀山北犯沛县、丰县。九日由东运来番号不明之六个团，于砀山下车。九、十两日，内黄、野鸡岗车站均发现由西运来之国民党部队下车，驻于瑟庄车站。徐州亦发现增来一百三十七师、八十四师番号之部队。驻砀山虞城之间之蒋嘉宾部（淮北挺进第四纵队），在冀黄河南岸修筑碉堡，待机进攻。平汉线方面，国民党军命令其所属自淇县东南之淇门、淇县北之大赐庄、颢沟、安阳东之柳圆、崔家桥、辛店集等地以营为单位，构筑工事，以连排构筑纵深之碉堡群，其三分之一的兵力配合地方武装，负责守备，三分之二的兵力集结布置，待机进攻。安阳之四十军，亦于五月一日开始进行攻击与防守训练。豫北交通警察之番号，已于五日宣布取消，其原来所属程道生、郭清与其他地方团队，均归四十军指挥。安阳之李英部，有移至安阳东南太阳消息。安阳汽车站已由西关迁至东关。据此情况，平汉线之国民党军，即将东向进攻我冀鲁豫四分区，企图已极明显。"

    "content": "After Wage Increases and Reduced Working Hours\n    Zibo Mining Area Coal Production Doubles\n    Workers on the Ping-Sui Railway are Highly Motivated After Anti-Traitor Campaign\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Boshan, 12th] Coal production in the Zichuan and Boshan mining areas is increasing daily. The daily output of the Xinqing Coal Mine Company has increased from 265 tons to 630 tons. Zichuan Coal Mine Company increased from over 100 tons to 400 tons. Xinbo Coal Mine Company increased from 126 tons to 200 tons. The Xihe Coal Mine Company increased from 150 tons to 500 tons. The main reasons why various companies can quickly recover and increase production after the serious destruction by the enemy and puppets are: (1) Workers' wages have been increased, with a daily subsidy of nine and a half catties of fine grain per person; (2) Mining time has been changed to ten hours, fire prevention devices are installed in the No. 2 coal mine, and stone walls are built to prevent water disasters; boiled water is delivered by elevators, and various health care equipment are enhanced; wages are directly paid to workers, and labor affairs sections and other entities that exploited workers in the past have been abolished. The most loyal employees in each company are appointed to be responsible for work. Due to the implementation of the above reforms, workers' coal mining efficiency has improved compared to before, with per capita output increasing by 40% per shift.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Fengzhen, 10th] Railway workers of Ping-Sui have undergone 37 revenge and liquidation campaigns against traitors, pseudo-elements, and labor scabs in the past six months, with the participation of more than 1,000 employees. A total of more than 400,000 catties of grain and more than 200,000 yuan in local currency have been calculated. In order to further improve workers' lives, the trade union has established 18 workers' cooperatives between every five stations. At Pingdiquan Station, more than 300 employees automatically raised 620,000 yuan to open a \"Transportation Passenger and Freight Station\". The trade union has also organized workers' families to engage in production. After the improvement of employees' lives, their enthusiasm has greatly increased. In addition to working eight hours a day, they also spend two hours studying politics, culture, and business. Workers' reading groups and business drama clubs have been established between various sections and stations. In the past, 2.5 track repair workers were needed per kilometer, but now only 1.5 people are needed.

    "date": "1946-05-16",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "【Xinhua News Agency, Changzhi, 13th】Through bottom-up general elections, people's representatives from fifteen counties in the new and old liberated areas of Taihang are enthusiastically reviewing the government's work in county councils. At the Xing (tai) xi County Council, all councilors unanimously praised the achievements in production and construction over the past few years. The labor force organized in the county was 47% the year before last, which increased to 60% last year, increasing grain production by more than 59,000 shi. The number of women spinners in the county has increased from 3,000 to 30,700 in the past two years. One hundred and four cooperatives have been organized in the county, with a share capital of 9.64 million yuan and more than 11,000 members. 224 lazy people were reformed and 530 impoverished households were helped to turn themselves around, greatly improving the lives of the people throughout the county. On April 28, the Huguan County Council also enthusiastically praised the democratic government's unprecedented great achievements in organizing 30,000 disaster-stricken people in the county to engage in production for self-salvation and overcome natural disasters in 1943 and 1944. The 55 county councilors in She County were particularly satisfied with the government's conscientious implementation of rent and interest reduction over the years, which improved the people's lives. In 1942 alone, more than 7,000 tenant debtor households in the mass movement turned themselves around, and more than 1,000 hired workers increased their wages, eliminating 1,050 impoverished households, allowing the people of the county to free themselves from feudal shackles. The people of the county launched a large-scale production movement with unprecedented enthusiasm. Councilors in Pingshun County gave the highest evaluation to the democratic government's leadership in carrying out investigations and rent reduction throughout the county and reforming the county's village government. At the Wuzhi County Council, a border county in the Yubei Liberated Area, Party member Wang Dinghua praised the democratic government's correct policy of combining armed force and mass movement in the most excited tone, suppressing bandits and illegal guns, and helping the people of Wuzhi to turn themselves around, which is the dictatorship most supported by the people. In the enthusiastic review of government work, county councilors in various counties enthusiastically put forward construction suggestions: On April 29, the 81 county councilors in Lucheng put forward the guiding principles for the county's construction this year. In the new areas, it is necessary to continue to thoroughly implement the rent reduction decree and organize the masses to carry out large-scale production, so that everyone has enough to eat and wear. In the old areas, it is necessary to improve mutual assistance and improve technology to generally achieve \"耕三余一\" [Geng San Yu Yi - cultivate three and have one remaining - meaning 1/4 of the produce can be kept by the farmer]. All councilors in She County proposed that the government should actively set up coal stations to solve the problem of coal burning for the people of the county, prohibit mountain opening, and plant trees extensively to prevent floods. County councilors in Xing (tai) xi, Tangyin and other counties also proposed to strengthen universal education and improve mass culture. They were very satisfied with the government's policy of making education expenditure the largest expenditure in the county after the administrative office reduced burdens this year. They said, \"We can no longer let our children and grandchildren become blind with their eyes open.\" In the county councils of Changzhi, Licheng, Jiqi, Piancheng, Xingtai, Ping (ding) dong, Xiangyuan and other counties, they more indignantly discussed the current domestic situation and unanimously passed a telegram to the whole country, opposing the Kuomintang fascist faction's crime of expanding the civil war, and calling on the people of the county to organize themselves to defend the fruits of the eight-year war of resistance and prepare for self-defense in order to smash the reactionary faction's evil conspiracy to undermine peace.\n    Note: After the administrative office of the Taihang region issued instructions in early April, the general election movement in the entire Taihang region was carried out from top to bottom in the new and old liberated areas. The counties carried out publicity mobilization and citizen registration from top to bottom.

Furthermore, the situation is also at a stalemate in the front lines of Sipingjie. (1) In the Northeast, Sipingjie is still being firmly defended by the Democratic Allied Army. The defense of the city has lasted for 25 days, with the entire line in a state of deadlock. Zheng Dongguo is personally督战 at the front lines, but is unable to change the situation. Currently, the Kuomintang authorities are increasing the deployment of reinforcements. (2) Along the Yangtze River in Jiangsu and Anhui, Kuomintang troops are frequently mobilizing between Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and Taixing, actively planning to attack the Jiangsu-Anhui border region. The entirety of their 73rd Army is concentrated near Pukou on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, while their 48th Army's 18th Division and 49th Army's 38th Division are pressing towards Dingyuan, in the Fourth Sub-district of the Jiangsu-Anhui region. The units of their 49th Army's 79th Division have been reinforcing defenses southwest of Jingjiang City along the river. General Su Yu, Deputy Commander of the Jiangsu-Anhui Military Region, issued a statement, pointing out the severity of the situation and calling on the people of the whole country to stop the Kuomintang troops' attacks. (3) In Central Hebei, Kuomintang troops and puppet troops in Cangzhou, Qingxian, and Yangliuqing on the Jinpu Railway, and in Shijiazhuang, Zhengding, and Xincheng on the Pinghan Railway, are launching frequent attacks, attempting to encircle the Central Hebei liberated area from both the east and west. (4) In Shanxi, Yan Xishan successively summoned Wang Jingguo, Zhao Chengzhou, and others to Yuci for military meetings, arranging for a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas. Two divisions of Yan's troops in central Shanxi are concentrated in Taiyuan City as mobile forces, ready to depart at any time. More than 6,000 Japanese troops have been reorganized by Yan into four special service regiments and are still stationed along the Tongpu Railway. (5) More than 2,000 troops of Wu Huawen, a rebel from Yanzhou, attacked east of Yanzhou City on the 5th, but were repulsed by our army. (6) Kuomintang troops continue to invade the Central Plains Military Region. The Queshan security regiment occupied Shigun River, west of Queshan, on the 5th and continued to advance south towards Wagang.\n    [New China News Agency, Yan'an, 13th] Kuomintang troops near Yang(zhou), Tai(zhou), Jing(Nanjing), and Zhen(jiang) have been frequently mobilizing and actively making deployments, awaiting orders to attack our liberated areas. The Kuomintang 25th Army stationed in Yangzhou was transferred to Taizhou on the 6th and 7th. The newly arrived Kuomintang troops in Zhenjiang and Nanjing are continuously moving north to Yangzhou. South of the Huagi Camp (near Jiangpu) station on the Jinpu Railway, the Kuomintang army has concentrated the entire 73rd Army and the 18th Division of the 48th Army, which are pressing towards the Dingyuan County border in the Fourth Sub-district of the Jiangsu-Anhui border region (i.e., the western liberated area), constructing field fortifications. Furthermore, the 235th Regiment and 337th Regiment of the 79th Division of the Kuomintang 49th Army, after reinforcing Jingjiang City on the 18th of last month, reoccupied our Xingang on the 26th and reinforced Ba＠gang (southwest of Jingjiang City along the river) on the 28th, actively building fortifications. All ironware from all blacksmith shops in Jingjiang City was seized to manufacture military equipment, and the wheat seedlings of residents near Ba＠gang, Xingang, Xieqiao, and other places near Jingjiang City and along the roads were cut down. Under the looting of the Kuomintang army, more than 80,000 people in the suburbs of Jingjiang City are currently without food.

Mr. Wang Ren, a just lawyer who voluntarily served as the newspaper's legal counsel to uphold freedom of speech, has been executed by the Kuomintang authorities on trumped-up charges. Mr. Li Furen, the editor of the Xi'an Masses' Guide and a democratic figure in Xi'an's educational circles, has been assassinated by Kuomintang agents. All patriots must express their utmost indignation at this series of atrocities!\n    Since the Political Consultative Conference, there have been over a hundred cases of the Kuomintang authorities endangering freedom of speech and assassinating just individuals. For example, the unwarranted arrest of preparatory personnel for the Nanjing Xinhua Daily, the ransacking of the Chongqing Xinhua Daily business department and the Democratic Daily business office, the illegal search of the Beiping Liberation Daily and the Xinhua branch office, the sealing off of the Cultural Guide of the Shenyang Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the forced closure of the Guiyang Masses' Bi-Monthly and the Beiping Lu Xun Evening News – these are just a few of the well-known instances of persecution suffered by the press. To undermine peace and democracy and to persist in civil war and dictatorship, the Kuomintang reactionaries spare no brutal means to trample on journalistic endeavors striving for peace and democracy, and they resort to every inhuman plot to murder those who struggle for peace and journalists. These cases raise our vigilance and call for greater unity to swiftly crush the reactionaries' vicious conspiracy!\n    Journalists, cultural figures, educators, legal professionals, and all compatriots nationwide, we must unanimously support Qin Feng Industry and Commerce Daily and the Democratic Guide, demanding that the Kuomintang authorities severely punish the perpetrators of the Xi'an massacre and all those who have perpetrated atrocities that undermine the people's freedom of speech and personal freedom, compensate for losses, immediately cease the acts of terror, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. Journalists nationwide must redouble our efforts, treading in the bloodstained footsteps of our martyred predecessors, firmly standing our ground to strive for peace and democracy, standing on the side of speaking for the people, and continuing to fight the Kuomintang reactionaries to the very end!\n                                All-Liberated Area Journalists Association, May 11\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 12th] The journalistic circles of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, including People's Daily, Ji'nan Daily, Ji-Lu-Yu Daily, Taihang, Taiyue Xinhua Daily, and Xinhua branch offices, have jointly issued a letter and telegram regarding the Xi'an massacre and the forced closure of the Qin Feng Industry and Commerce Daily, stating in brief: The Xi'an massacre once again demonstrates that the Kuomintang fascists are the mortal enemies of the Chinese people's peace cause and the national press. They are determined to strangle all journalistic endeavors and journalists who serve the cause of peace and democracy. The journalistic circles nationwide must unite closely, actively assist our colleagues in distress, and demand that Chiang Kai-shek immediately implement the four pledges.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    Zhōngguó (China)\n延安    Yán'ān\n西安    Xī'ān\n南京    Nánjīng\n重庆    Chóngqìng\n北平    Běipíng (Beiping, now Beijing)\n沈阳    Shěnyáng\n贵阳    Guìyáng\n邯郸    Hándān\n晋冀鲁豫边区    Jìn Jì Lǔ Yù Biānqū (Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region)\n太行    Tàiháng\n太岳    Tàiyuè\n\n王任    Wáng Rèn\n李敷仁    Lǐ Fūrén\n蒋介石    Jiǎng Jièshí (Chiang Kai-shek)\n\n新华社  Xīnhuá Shè (Xinhua News Agency)\n秦风工商日报 Qín Fēng Gōngshāng Rìbào (Qin Feng Industry and Commerce Daily)\n西安民众导报 Xī'ān Mínzhòng Dǎobào (Xi'an Masses' Guide)\n新华日报 Xīnhuá Rìbào (Xinhua Daily)\n民主报 Mínzhǔ Bào (Democratic Daily)\n解放报  Jiěfàng Bào (Liberation Daily)\n中苏友好协会 Zhōng-Sū Yǒuhǎo Xiéhuì (Sino-Soviet Friendship Association)\n文化导报  Wénhuà Dǎobào (Cultural Guide)\n大众半月刊  Dàzhòng Bànyuèkān (Masses' Bi-Monthly)\n鲁迅晚报  Lǔ Xùn Wǎnbào (Lu Xun Evening News)\n人民日报  Rénmín Rìbào (People's Daily)\n冀南日报  Jìnán Rìbào (Ji'nan Daily)\n冀鲁豫日报 Jì Lǔ Yù Rìbào (Ji-Lu-Yu Daily)\n太行新华日报  Tàiháng Xīnhuá Rìbào (Taihang Xinhua Daily)\n太岳新华日报 Tàiyuè Xīnhuá Rìbào (Taiyue Xinhua Daily)\n解放区新闻记者联合会 Jiěfàngqū Xīnwén Jìzhě Liánhé Huì (All-Liberated Area Journalists Association)\n\n政治协商会议  Zhèngzhì Xiéshāng Huìyì (Political Consultative Conference)\n西安血案  Xī'ān xuè'àn (Xi'an Massacre)\n四项诺言  Sì xiàng nuòyán (Four Pledges)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 解放区新闻记者联合会通电  抗议当局制造西安血案  号召新闻、法律界团结一致，迅速粉碎反动派毒辣阴谋。\n\n1946-05-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　解放区新闻记者联合会通电\n    抗议当局制造西安血案\n    号召新闻、法律界团结一致，迅速粉碎反动派毒辣阴谋。\n    【新华社延安十二日电】解放区新闻记者联合会为抗议国民党当局摧残西安秦风工商日报屠杀西安新闻界、法律界名流，顷通电全国新闻、文教、法律界称：全国各通讯社、各报馆转全国文化界、教育界、法律界暨全国同胞公鉴：\n    西安的公正的言论机关秦风工商日报在国民党当局百般推残下被迫停刊了，为维护言论自由，自动担任该报法律顾问的公正律师王任先生，被国民党当局以莫须有罪名处死了，西安民众导报主编、西安教育界民主人士李敷仁先生被国民党特务暗杀了。对这一连串的暴行，一切爱国者更需要表示十二万分的愤慨！\n    自政协会以来，国民党当局危害言论自由、暗杀公正人士的案件，已有百数十起，例如：南京新华日报筹备人员的无辜被捕，重庆新华日报营业部、民主报营业处等被捣毁，北平解放报与新华分社遭受非法搜查、沈阳中苏友好协会的文化导报被查封、贵阳大众半月刊，北平鲁迅晚报被迫停版，这不过是新闻界受迫害的几件众所皆知的而已。国民党反动派为了破坏和平民主，坚持内战独裁，不惜一切残暴手段，蹂躏为和平民主奋斗的新闻事业，不惜用一切惨绝人寰的毒计，杀害为和平奋斗人士及新闻从业员。这些案件提起我们更大的警觉，要我们更加团结一致，迅速粉碎反动派的毒辣阴谋！\n    全国新闻界、文化界、教育界、法律界及全国同胞们，我们要一致声援秦风工商日报及民主导报，要求国民党当局严惩西安血案以及一切摧残人民言论人身自由的暴行凶手，赔偿损失，立即停止恐怖暴行，保证今后不再有类似事件发生。我全国新闻界更应再接再厉，踏着死难诸先烈的血迹，坚定的站稳为和平民主奋斗的立场，为人民说话的立场，和国民党反动派继续奋斗到底！\n                                解放区新闻记者联合会五月十一日\n    【新华社邯郸十二日电】晋冀鲁豫边区新闻界人民日报、冀南日报、冀鲁豫日报、太行、太岳新华日报及新华分社等顷为西安惨案及秦风工商日报被迫停刊，特联名发出函电，略称：西安惨案，又一次说明国民党法西斯派是中国人民和平事业及全国新闻事业的死敌，他们决心要绞杀一切为和平民主事业服务的新闻事业和新闻从业员，全国新闻界密切团结起来，积极援助被难同业，要求蒋介石立即执行四项诺言。"

After the meeting, they held a demonstration and procession and flocked to the Imperial Palace, demanding that the Japanese Emperor open the food reserves and provide food for the starving people. During negotiations with officials inside the palace, representatives of the demonstrators strongly protested against the palace guards for preventing people from entering the Imperial Palace. The Japanese people flocking to the Imperial Palace to petition is an unprecedented event in Japanese history.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, Fourteenth] According to a United Press dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 12th, demanding that the new cabinet be headed by the Socialist Party, with the participation of the Communist Party, to form a democratic government. The statement said: The Communist Party regards the abolition of the Emperor system as its own responsibility, but as long as the Japanese Emperor still has the power to appoint the Prime Minister according to the Constitution, the Japanese Communist Party should make demands not only to Kijūrō Shidehara, but also to Hirohito. The statement pointed out that Shidehara had rejected the party's demand on April 10 for the establishment of a Socialist Party and Communist Party government, so it was necessary to make demands directly to the Emperor. Demonstrations were then held not only outside the Prime Minister's official residence, but also in front of the Imperial Palace and the Minister of the Imperial Household.

Their modus operandi is to cooperate with local puppet troops, bandits, and KMT armies to launch surprise attacks on the residences of our militia in border villages, and to conduct disintegration work by combining feudal organizations and adopting means of threats, enticements, and rumors. Special agents in the border areas of the Fourth Military Sub-district, in coordination with Ding Shuben, Wang Sanzhu, and other puppet troops from Dongming, Changyuan, and Fengqiu in the border areas, frequently attacked our militia residences in border villages with 300 to 500 people. On April 11th, the KMT’s 68th Army from Changyuan, in coordination with local bandits, surrounded the militia of Bin Village, Seventh District, Hua County, and captured eleven militiamen from the village. Similar incidents have occurred in Gaoling and Neihuang. According to incomplete statistics from the Fourth Military Sub-district, since the ceasefire order, 162 militiamen in the sub-district have been captured or killed, and more than 150 guns have been lost. The militia captain of Mengzhuang, Changyuan, was dragged outside the village by armed special agents and threatened, being given two days to bring the villagers' militia into Dongming City, otherwise, \"the whole family would be exterminated.\" In the Seventh District of Qi County, the method of \"buying insurance\" from secret societies was used to deceive the militia. In Weinan, rumors were fabricated that \"the Eighth Route Army is pulling the militia to the Northeast,\" calling on the militia to hand in their guns.

    "content": "Kuomintang's Perverse Actions: Not Rescuing Disaster Victims but Rescuing Puppet Troops\n    Border Region Relief Association Sends Telegram to the Nation Protesting\n    [Our Special Dispatch] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Relief Association, regarding the reactionary Kuomintang's perverse actions of airlifting large quantities of ammunition, flour, and large pancakes to supply the puppet troops in Yongnian, while failing to provide relief to the vast disaster-stricken population in the liberated areas who persisted in the eight-year War of Resistance, sent a telegram to the nation on the 14th of this month, calling for an immediate halt to the use of airplanes to transport supplies to puppet troops, to uphold justice, and to provide fair relief. The original telegram is as follows:\n    To Chairman Chiang of the National Government, Chairman Mao of Yan'an, the Beiping Executive Headquarters, all newspapers, and all relief organizations:\n    Our liberated area has endured eight years of the War of Resistance and four years of famine. The sacrifices and losses of the people are unprecedentedly severe. Among the 28,514,368 people in the entire liberated area, 3,141,625 were killed by the enemy and puppets. 5,763,149 houses were burned down, and livestock and property were looted. Currently, 4,382,865 disaster victims urgently need relief. Their miserable situation has already been witnessed by Mr. An Dingyuan of UNRRA and Mr. Zhang Chongde of CNRRA. However, the National Government's enthusiasm and activeness in rescuing such a vast number of disaster victims cannot match its enthusiasm for rescuing the puppet troops in Yongnian. For the 2,000 puppet troops in Yongnian, the National Government regularly sends one or two airplanes to transport ammunition, flour, and large pancakes, as many as three times a day. The 6,370 residents within the city walls, however, have not received a single share. Some disaster victims are beaten for picking up pancake crumbs from the ground, and most of their houses have been damaged by the packages. More than twenty innocent people have been killed by the packages. The foreign flour and large pancakes transported by the puppet troops by airplane are used to feed more than two thousand fat pigs, raising strong riding horses and mules. In contrast, the vast number of disaster victims who struggled for national survival and persisted in the eight-year War of Resistance are not as well off as the traitorous and evil-doing Han traitors and puppet troops. Where is humanity? Where is justice?

From documents seized from the Democratic Allied Army, a despicable telegram from the Kuomintang army regarding the conscription of Japanese prisoners of war was discovered. The original text is as follows: Army 87th Division Headquarters Telegram No. 989, April 15th, 35th year of the Republic of China, to the 21st Regiment: Regarding the case of conscripting Japanese officers and soldiers, we have received orders that it can only be handled under the guise of conscripting enemy prisoners for labor service. Details were previously relayed in the December 17th telegram. This division is conscripting 126 enemy prisoners this time, which cannot be added to this division's roster. A sample format for the designated roster is attached with this telegram. You are to quickly create five copies for submission for record-keeping and to request provisions. Please comply accordingly, in addition to sending separate telegrams. Signed, Division Commander Huang Yan, Deputy Division Commander Peng Quefang. Attached is a sample format for the conscripted enemy prisoner roster.\n    From this, it can be seen that the Kuomintang army is expending a great deal of effort in conscripting Japanese prisoners of war as tools for its civil war to massacre compatriots.

    "content": "Kuomintang Areas Suffer Severe Famine\n    Big and Small Officials Make a Fortune from Relief Funds\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th] The famine in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is extremely severe. Not only is the authorities relying solely on the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for relief materials, but officials of all ranks are doing everything they can to steal and embezzle UNRRA relief supplies. It is said that Yueyang, Hunan, was allocated a batch of clothing, but failed to receive it according to the original quota. Even those who received it often found that it had been replaced with tattered Chinese clothing. (April 15th, *Xinwen Bao* \"How to Relieve the Hunan Disaster\") In Guangzhou, after a batch of relief clothing was transported in, it suddenly disappeared before it was scheduled to be distributed. In Henan, a large batch of Western suits were transported to Kaifeng. Just as the relief distribution office was preparing to distribute the Western suits to the refugees, someone suddenly suggested that it would be inappropriate for the refugees to wear foreign clothes; it would be better to convert them into Chinese clothes for distribution to the refugees. This suggestion was certainly excellent, but what was extremely un-excellent was that after these clothes were sold, there was no further news of the proceeds. In Guangzhou, a large batch of relief flour disappeared without a trace, losing several thousand bags. A large quantity of relief supplies was taken by those in power to repay debts and hoard for profit. In March, the Hunan Relief Distribution Office allocated over 90 million yuan in agricultural loans to various disaster areas. As soon as this loan reached the hands of the parties involved, it was withheld, either to be used as capital for them to lend out and collect interest, or to be used for bribing for official positions. These parties charged interest rates as high as 2,000 yuan per month per 10,000 yuan loaned, or loaned one *shi* of rice to be repaid with two *shi* in the autumn (*Xinwen Bao* \"How to Relieve the Hunan Disaster\"). Hu Zijian, the district head of the eighth district of Hengyang, in order to get elected as a municipal councilor, withheld 550,000 yuan in funds and more than ten large bags of relief clothing for his personal bribery (*Zhengyan Bao*, April 15th, \"Incidents of Disaster Relief in Hunan Province\"). What is particularly noteworthy is that on March 24th, Yu Hongjun, representing the Kuomintang government, made a financial report at the National Political Consultative Conference, in which he openly proposed that the utilization of general relief materials be listed as a \"source of wealth\" for \"balancing revenue and expenditure,\" \"stabilizing finance,\" and \"enriching local finances.\"\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    China\n国民党    Kuomintang\n新华社    Xinhua News Agency\n延安    Yan'an\n联合国救济总署    United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA)\n湖南    Hunan\n岳阳    Yueyang\n新闻报    Xinwen Bao\n广州    Guangzhou\n河南    Henan\n汴    Kaifeng\n俞鸿钧    Yu Hongjun\n国参会    National Political Consultative Conference\n衡阳    Hengyang\n胡子健    Hu Zijian\n正言报    Zhengyan Bao\n湘    Xiang\n石    Shi\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党区灾荒严重  大小官大发救济财\n\n1946-05-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党区灾荒严重\n    大小官大发救济财\n    【新华社延安十二日电】国民党统治区灾荒极端严重，当局不惟只靠联合国救济总署物资救济，且大小官员对联总救济物资，极尽盗窃侵吞之能事。湖南岳阳据说分得账衣一部，却未能依照原定配额领取，即使领得者，亦多是经过调换的破破烂烂的中国服装。（四月十五日，新闻报《如何救济湘灾》）在广州运到同批赈衣后，忽然在定期分发以前，不翼而飞了。在河南也有大批西装运汴，救济分署正预备将西服分发给难民时，忽然有人建议，给难民穿上洋衣服，那像啥事体，还不如把它改购中国衣服，分发给难民。这个建议固然极妙，但极不妙的却是把这些衣服一变卖之后，就再无音讯了。广州运到一批救济面粉，没头没脑就失掉了几千包。大批的救济物资，被有权者拿去抵债居奇。三月份湖南救济分署，向各灾区配发了九千余万元农贷，这笔农贷一到当事者手里，就被扣留下来，或作为他们放款收息的资本，或供他们贿选官职的费用，这些当事者贷起款来，月息每万元高达二千元，或贷稻一石，至秋天要还二石（新闻报《如何救济湘灾》）衡阳第八区区长胡子健，为了想当选市参议员，扣帐款五十五万元及赈衣十余大袋，作了私人贿选之用（四月十五日正言报《湘省赈灾拾闻》）。尤其值得世人注意的，就是三月廿四日俞鸿钧在国参会上，代表国民党政府所作的财政报告，他公开提出总救济物资的利用，列为“平衡收支”“稳定金融”和“充裕地方财政”的一个“财源”。"

    "content": "Taihang New Liberated Area\n    Rent Reduction Reaches Intense Stage\n    Intensify Mass Movement Blitz Before Summer Harvest to Ensure Implementation\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Changzhi, 13th] The rent reduction movement in the new areas of Taihang counties has reached its most intense stage. The one month from now until the wheat harvest will be a month of concentrated effort to mobilize the masses. The county councils that recently concluded in various counties all have resolutions to \"swiftly implement the rent reduction decree.\" The Anyang County Party Committee also recently issued a call stating: \"The movement urgently needs to deepen and strive for balance; we must complete this arduous task before the wheat harvest.\" Xiuwu, on the Daokou-Qinghua Railway line, is even more intense. In late last month, when the county held an expanded meeting of cadres and rent reduction activists, only thirteen villages in the county had reduced rents, and nineteen villages were deliberating. However, after reviewing the cadres' neglect of rent reduction and the \"no hurry, take it slow\" mentality, it was decided that rent reduction must be implemented before the wheat harvest. Now, one-third of the villages in the county have been drawn into the rent reduction movement. Tangyin, on the west side of the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan, has also seen the land reform movement expand from points to the entire area after the county's activist meeting in late last month. In the Jinzhong area, Shouyang and Qi County are using the \"support from above to take the lead\" approach to make the mass movement universal throughout the county. In the Jindong New District of Heshun, the mass movement has developed rapidly and has now shifted to a large-scale production movement, but at the same time, investigation and reduction of rents continues. In Nanliyang Village in the county, the recent accounting of the evil landlord Jiao's accounts greatly encouraged the masses' production enthusiasm. Neiqiu in western Hebei interrupted the mass movement after shifting to production; the masses' production enthusiasm was very low because they had not completely turned over. It was recently decided to re-launch the movement during the production movement, breaking all the stubborn landlords' attempts to delay and reverse the decisions.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n太行\tTaihang\n安阳\tAnyang\n道清线\tDaokou-Qinghua Railway Line\n修武\tXiuwu\n豫北\tNorthern Henan\n平汉\tPinghan Railway\n汤阴\tTangyin\n晋中\tJinzhong\n寿阳\tShouyang\n祁县\tQi County\n晋东\tJindong\n和顺\tHeshun\n南李阳村\tNanliyang Village\n焦某\tJiao (surname)\n冀西\tWestern Hebei\n内邱\tNeiqiu\n新华社\tXinhua News Agency\n长治\tChangzhi\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行新解放区  减租已至紧张阶段  夏收前加紧群运突击，以求贯彻。\n\n1946-05-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行新解放区\n    减租已至紧张阶段\n    夏收前加紧群运突击，以求贯彻。\n    【新华社长治十三日电】太行各县新区的减租运动，已至最紧张阶段；从现在到麦收的一个月中，将是半年来发动群众的突击月，各县最近先后闭幕的县议会，均有“迅速贯彻减租法令”的决议。安阳县委亦于最近发出号召称：“运动急须走向深入，并争取平衡，麦收前要完成这艰巨任务”。道清线上的修武，则更为紧张，上月下旬该县开扩干与减租积极分子大会时，全县才有十三村减了租，十九村在酝酿，但在检讨了干部忽视减租和“不着急慢慢来”的思想后，决定在麦收前必须贯彻减租，现在全县已有三分之一的村庄卷入减租运动。豫北平汉西侧的汤阴，在上月下旬全县积极分子大会后，翻身运动亦已由点推向了面的开展。晋中地区的寿阳、祁县，则正运用“自上而下撑腰作主”的放手方针，使群运普及全县。晋东和顺新区，群运发展较快，现已转入大生产运动，但同时仍在继续查减。该县南李阳村，最近算了恶霸地主焦某的帐后，大大鼓励了群众的生产情绪。冀西内邱于转入生产后，群运即告中断；群众因未彻底翻身，生产情绪甚低；最近决定在生产运动中重新发动，打破一切顽固地主的拖延与翻案企图。"

    "content": "Amidst the Victory of Our Siping Campaign\n    Kuomintang Soldiers are Weary of War\n    Sentry Carries American Weapons to Defect to Us; Warrior Squad Leader Chats Late at Night About When the Civil War Will End\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Siping Street, 14th] Our correspondent Chen Yi reports: The Kuomintang army attacking Siping Street has begun to show signs of war-weariness. On the afternoon of the 30th of last month, Zhang Mingxiu and Ding Wenfang, privates from the third squad of the first platoon of the eighth company of the third battalion of the 272nd Regiment of the 91st Division of the 71st Army, carrying two American-made rifles and over a hundred rounds of ammunition, voluntarily ran to the Eighth Route Army position of the Democratic Allied Forces north of Bamiancheng, and requested living expenses to return home. They said, \"As early as in our hometown of Rugao County, Jiangsu, we knew that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army are good armies that love the country and the people, so this time when we saw that the opposite side on the battlefield was the Eighth Route Army, we took the opportunity during sentry duty to run over.\" Similar war-weariness is also brewing in the New First Army on the front line of Siping Street. Because the two armies' positions are very close, only fifty meters apart, whenever the night is quiet and the sound of gunfire is sparse, one can faintly hear the Kuomintang soldiers and squad leaders talking in the bunkers. One soldier said, \"When will this war of fighting ourselves end? Wouldn't it be better for us to leave?\" The squad leader replied despairingly, \"We are surrounded like an iron bucket, where can we run to?\" When the New First Army attacks, the wounded and dead are often abandoned on the battlefield. As long as the gunfire stops briefly and there is calm and stillness, one can hear the tragic cries of the soldiers in the New First Army positions, sometimes even being eaten by dogs. Seeing this tragic situation, the commanders and fighters of the Democratic Allied Forces often risk going to bury them or provide treatment, and distribute leaflets to the New First Army, asking them to bury the bodies and drag back the wounded soldiers. As long as they do not carry weapons, the Democratic Allied Forces will never shoot. Peng Zhiyuan, the lieutenant company deputy of the Second Company of the Engineer Battalion of the 17th Division, who laid down his weapons, said, \"What pains me the most is that no one cares about the bodies and the wounded on the battlefield. What I admire and am most moved by is that you Eighth Route Army, no matter how dangerous it is, always pull down the bodies and the wounded of the soldiers, regardless of your own sacrifice.\" As for the more than ten thousand Kuomintang officers and soldiers liberated by the Democratic Allied Forces, they expressed their absolute unwillingness to have a civil war.

    "content": "Support the Development of Private Capital\n    Handan Automobile, Flour, and Other Public Companies\n    All Transferred to Private Management\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu General Branch News] In order to support the development of private capital, the democratic government here has decided to transfer the Handan Municipal Flour Company, Oil Pressing Factory, and publicly-owned Alcohol Factory, Iron Factory, and Automobile Company, originally managed by the government, to private operation. Currently, the Automobile Company has been taken over by Mr. Yao Shiji and others for 7 million Jichaobi (冀钞币), and renamed Hengli Automobile Company. The Alcohol Factory was taken over by Yang Hongxingtang (杨宏兴堂), Hu Fuyuantang (胡福源堂), and Yang Yongqingtang (杨永庆堂) for 5 million Jichaobi, and renamed Yihecheng Alcohol Factory. Dahua Flour Company is also in the process of clearing assets, registering old shareholders, and recruiting shareholders for reorganization. This flour company, formerly Yifeng Company, was founded in 1924. It has now developed to have three boilers and a 75-horsepower engine. Before the incident (likely referring to the Japanese invasion), its capital was 200,000 yuan, with over 100 shareholders. It had a considerable and stable market in Shijiazhuang and Beiping. However, since the Japanese occupation, it was placed under military management and renamed Nitto Company, affiliated with Nitto Seifun Co., Ltd., and all capital and profits were seized by the Japanese invaders. After the Japanese surrendered and our army liberated Handan, the current government, in order to take care of the interests of the old shareholders of the company, has decided to return the original machinery, real estate, and land to the original shareholders. The property added by the enemy will also be transferred to private individuals at a low price. The specific methods are: 1. Clear the assets, and price the machinery, houses, land, and goods one by one. The part belonging to the old shareholders will be distributed according to their shareholding amount at the current market price. The total capital in the past was 200,000 yuan. If the current value of this property is 4 million yuan, then the original 10,000 yuan shareholding will now be 200,000 yuan. 2. Notify all shareholders to come for registration. Except for those who have been found to have collaborated with the enemy and whose property should be confiscated according to law, all stocks are valid. In order to take care of shareholders scattered in places such as Tianjin and Beiping, a relatively ample registration time is stipulated. 3. Recruit new shares and reorganize into a new company.\n    The Automobile Company and the Alcohol Factory were both established in Handan after liberation, from scratch and from small to large. Technicians and workers worked hard to unload parts from many damaged cars and refit them into new cars, and now there are eight of them. In order to use alcohol to replace gasoline, they also repaired a broken old distillery, added some machines, and started making alcohol.\n    After privatization, they can freely set prices for tickets and freely sell wine and alcohol. Except for paying a business tax of less than 20% of net profit, they are not subject to any government restrictions.\n    [Another News] In order to support the development of the private economy, the General Administration of Industry and Commerce has transferred the Taihang No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 Cigarette Factories to private operation for more than 86 million yuan, and renamed them Daxing Tobacco Company. The fixed amount of capital is 200 million yuan, and share capital is currently being raised. The collected shares have reached 120.007 million yuan. Zhou Yuteng was elected as the chairman of the board, and Song Mingsan, Wang Lining, Zhang Yuan, and Li Guangjun were elected as directors. A shareholders' meeting is scheduled to be held on May 22.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n　\n晋冀鲁豫总分社   Jinji-Luyu General Branch\n邯郸 Handan\n姚石吉 Yao Shiji\n恒利汽车公司 Hengli Automobile Company\n杨宏兴堂 Yang Hongxingtang\n胡福源堂 Hu Fuyuantang\n杨永庆堂 Yang Yongqingtang\n义和成酒精厂 Yihecheng Alcohol Factory\n大华面粉公司 Dahua Flour Company\n怡丰公司 Yifeng Company\n石家庄 Shijiazhuang\n北平 Beiping\n日东公司 Nitto Company\n日东制粉株式会社 Nitto Seifun Co., Ltd.\n天津 Tianjin\n工商管理总局 General Administration of Industry and Commerce\n太行 Taihang\n大兴烟草公司 Daxing Tobacco Company\n周钰滕 Zhou Yuteng\n宋铭三 Song Mingsan\n王立宁 Wang Lining\n张垣 Zhang Yuan\n李光军 Li Guangjun\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 扶植私人资本发展  邯郸汽车、面粉等公营公司  全部转归私人经营\n\n1946-05-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　扶植私人资本发展\n    邯郸汽车、面粉等公营公司\n    全部转归私人经营\n    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社讯】为扶持私人资本之发展，此间民主政府决定将邯郸市原由政府管理之面粉公司、榨油厂，公营的酒精厂、铁工厂、汽车公司转让给私人经营。现汽车公司已由姚石吉先生等以七百万冀钞接收，改为恒利汽车公司。酒精厂由杨宏兴堂、胡福源堂、杨永庆堂以五百万冀钞接收，改为义和成酒精厂。大华面粉公司也正在清理财产，登记旧股东，召股改组。该面粉公司，即前怡丰公司，为民国十三年创办，现已发展到有三口锅炉，七十五匹马力的引擎，事变前，资本二十万元，股东一百余人，每日可出面三万斤，在石家庄和北平占有相当固定的市场，但自日寇占领即施行军事管理，改为日东公司，隶属于日东制粉株式会社，所有资本与利润全部为日寇所侵夺。日本投降后我军解放邯郸，现政府为照顾该公司旧股东利益，已决定将原有的机器、房产、地产、退还原股东。敌人添置的财产也廉价转让给私人。具体的办法是：一、清理财产，将机器、房屋、地皮、货物一一作价，属于旧股东的部分，以现在市价，按其股票金额分配之，过去总资金为二十万，如现在此项财产值四百万，则过去一万元之股金，现在则为二十万元。二、通知各股东前来登记，审查股票除通敌有据，其财产依法应予没收者外，一律有效。并为照顾散居平津等地之股东，规定了比较充裕的登记时间。三、召募新股，改组为新的公司。\n    汽车公司与酒精厂都是在邯郸解放后，从无到有，从小到大地建立起来的。技师们和工人们艰苦地从许多毁坏了的汽车上卸下零件，改装成新的汽车，现在已经八部了。为了用酒精代替汽油，又把一个坏了的旧烧锅加以修补，添了些机器，造起酒精来。\n    私营之后，可自由定价售票，自由出卖酒与酒精，除缴纳低于纯利百分之二十的营业税外，不受政府任何限制。\n    【又讯】工商管理总局为扶植私人经济发展，特将太行一、二、三、四、五、六烟厂以八千六百余万元转让给私人经营，改名为大兴烟草公司。资金定额二万万元，现正招募股金，集股已达一万万二千零零七万元。选出周钰滕为董事长，宋铭三、王立宁、张垣、李光军为董事，订于五月二十二日召开股东会议。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "With the greatest grief, we commemorate Comrades Wang Ruofei, Qin Bangxian, Deng Fa, Ye Ting, Mr. Huang Qisheng, and other comrades who died at the same time. Because the Kuomintang's Chiang Kai-shek and his fascist group sabotaged the Three Major Agreements, and in order to seek the realization of peace and democracy, and for the benefit of the country and the people, they risked the greatest danger, flying back and forth, and as a result, they were killed. This is an irreparable loss to our party and the Chinese people! Their sacrifice is a very painful thing for us, and at the same time, it reminds us once again: Chinese fascists and their chieftains will always hate the Chinese people, and will always hate peace and democracy. Only when the Chinese people see through their thoroughly reactionary nature and fully demonstrate their great and invincible strength can China's peace and democracy be truly realized. Chairman Mao called on us: turn grief into strength. We must use the strength of the liberated areas and the strength of the people of the whole country to inherit the legacy of the martyrs, stop the reaction of the fascists, adhere to the Three Major Agreements, and realize peace and democracy.\n\n    Where does our strength lie? It lies in whether we can fully mobilize the masses of the people, turn themselves over and become the true masters of the country with their own strength; it lies in our consistent, unwavering unity.\n\n    Since the counter-offensive last year, all parts of the border region have firmly grasped the central link of speaking out about suffering, seeking revenge, reducing rent and interest, and mobilizing the masses. This is very correct. However, we should all calmly reflect: Is the work of mobilizing the masses done enough? Are there people who only see some improprieties in certain struggle methods (which should of course be corrected) and shout \"leftist,\" actually putting themselves in a position of being restrained, afraid to let go boldly, and even opposing the mass movement? Do they understand that today the problem is not enough mobilization, but not \"excessive\"? Do our comrades who do mass work still have the problem of not investigating, not studying, being crude and careless, and mobilizing the masses solely based on a few principles and subjective demands? Do they still have the problem of \"patronizing views\" and doing everything for the masses? Do they see that due to mistakes of doing everything for the masses and subjectivism, the masses in many places have not been truly mobilized, and there are still many blank spots? Are there still problems of violating policies such as infringing on the interests of middle peasants? Have those of us doing urban work made the mistake of moving the set of rural practices into the cities? Do our comrades who do workers' movements understand the policy of benefiting both labor and capital and developing production? Are there problems of excessive demands that hinder economic prosperity? Do our comrades in the army support the people's emancipation movement with the greatest enthusiasm? Have they shown the essence of the people's army and actively participated in the people's emancipation movement? Are there still people who doubt or oppose the mass movement because their families have been struggled against by the masses? Are there still people who are emotionally opposed to the mass movement because of insufficient preferential treatment for families of soldiers or other shortcomings in individual places? If there are these shortcomings, they must be corrected, because if the masses of the people are not emancipated, there is no way to exert strength. If the masses of the people do not fully exert their strength, the cause of peace and democracy cannot be realized and cannot be consolidated. And our leadership and support for the people's emancipation must not be an empty concept, but must be expressed in concrete and practical actions.\n\n    Here, we want to talk about the issue of work style. Chairman Mao taught us that our work style is a work style of unity between theory and practice, a work style of unity between the people and the people's interests, and a work style of self-criticism. With such a work style, we can truly serve the people and be the servants of the people. We must be vigilant. Since the counter-offensive, we have entered small and medium-sized cities. Have we maintained the work style of hard struggle and closeness to the masses? Every comrade should think, do I have the idea of hedonism? Do I have the problem of waste? This should arouse our serious attention. If this phenomenon develops, we will inevitably become detached from the masses, corrupt ourselves, and harm the Party and the country. We are not opposed to the enjoyment that each person should get within the scope of the system. We are not advocating enduring hardship to the end, but our lives must not be too far apart from the lives of the masses. Every penny we spend is the blood and sweat of the people. Today, when fascism is still rampant in China, a major enemy is present, the wounds of the eight-year war of resistance have yet to be healed, and the people's lives are still very difficult, if we do not take into account the people's ability to bear, if we waste, we will inevitably become detached from the masses and lead to failure. In the past, before Li Zicheng arrived in Beijing, he was indeed brave in combat, his policies were not bad, and his discipline was good, so he could get the support of the masses and win victory. Unexpectedly, once he arrived in Beiping, he became paralyzed against the enemy, did not talk about policies, became detached from the masses, his discipline was corrupted, and the soldiers lost their fighting spirit. In just a few dozen days, he brought about the failure of success. In the later period of the Great Revolution, there was also the so-called \"Five Leathers Doctrine\" (referring to taking pride in having leather bags, leather shoes, armed leather belts, leather whips, and leather leggings), which corrupted many revolutionary fighters. These historical lessons should be taken as a warning. Of course, today is different from the Great Revolution, and even more different from the Li Zicheng era, because there is the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao, but it cannot be said that Chairman Mao's leadership is correct, and that every region and every comrade of ours is naturally correct. If we want to avoid making mistakes or make fewer mistakes, we must implement Chairman Mao's call, be vigilant, introspect, wash our faces often, check our work, and improve our work. If we can do this, we can stand with the people, the people's strength will be fully exerted, and we will be an invincible force.\n\n    Speaking of unity, we are united, but are there any shortcomings? There are shortcomings. Taking the relationship between the army and the local area as an example, if a phenomenon of disharmony occurs, the army should first check its own responsibility. Of course, the local area should also check itself, focusing on self-criticism and correcting itself. From the overall relationship, the responsibility of the local area and the responsibility of the army cannot be put on an equal footing, because historical experience has proven that as long as the army is good to the local area, the local area will not be bad to the army. The army is one point good to the local area, and the local area is always two points good to the army. There is also a saying that is wrong, that is, the confused concept of so-called \"the people are lovable, but the government cannot be supported.\" In fact, the government is the people's government. Those who do not support the government will not love the people. Supporting the government and loving the people cannot be separated.\n\n    Finally, while mourning Comrade Wang Ruofei and others, I have two thoughts. One thought is that these comrades have all gone through decades of training, fighting for the cause of the Party and the people with unwavering loyalty. Comrades Wang and Ye have also sat in prison for several years in the struggle for the cause of the Party and the people. They did not care about personal honor or status, did not care about personal enjoyment, and wholeheartedly worked for the people. We are very saddened by their deaths, and we must learn from their valuable qualities of sacrificing everything and dedicating themselves to the revolution for life. Another thought is that from the history of our Party, it is proven that when we violate Chairman Mao's thoughts and policies, we will inevitably make mistakes, and even if we work hard, we will not be able to achieve results, and even harm the revolution. When we understand Chairman Mao's thoughts to some extent and earnestly implement Chairman Mao's instructions, we can play a greater role and do more things for the people. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, these comrades fought unyielding struggles against the reactionaries for the benefit of the people. They were good students of Chairman Mao and excellent leaders of the masses. How can their deaths not make us sad?!\n\n    Comrades! Unite around Chairman Mao, learn Chairman Mao's thoughts, and train more good students of Chairman Mao to take over the posts of the deceased! Use greater efforts to mobilize the masses and unite them more closely. Use our strength and our unity to stop the conspiracies of the reactionaries, adhere to the Three Major Agreements, and realize peace and democracy! Only in this way can we make up for the loss of April 8th and console the spirits of the dead!\n\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n王若飞   Wang Ruofei\n秦邦宪   Qin Bangxian\n邓发   Deng Fa\n叶挺   Ye Ting\n黄齐生   Huang Qisheng\n蒋介石   Chiang Kai-shek\n毛泽东   Mao Zedong\n李自成   Li Zicheng\n北平   Beiping\n三大协议   Three Major Agreements\n五皮主义   Five Leathers Doctrine\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 把悲痛变为力量，与人民密切结合！  邓小平同志四月二十一日在党内干部追悼王若飞同志等殉难的会上的报告\n\n1946-05-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　把悲痛变为力量，与人民密切结合！\n    邓小平同志四月二十一日在党内干部追悼王若飞同志等殉难的会上的报告\n    我们以最大的悲痛，来追悼王若飞、秦邦宪、邓发、叶挺诸同志和黄齐生老先生，以及其他同时被难的同志，他们因为国民党蒋介石及其法西斯集团破坏三大协议，为了求得和平民主的实现，为了国家和人民的利益，不惜冒着最大的危险，从空中飞来飞去，结果他们被难了，这是我党和中国人民不可补偿的损失！他们的牺牲，是我们很痛心的事，同时也再一次的提醒我们：中国法西斯及其头子永远是仇视中国人民的，永远是仇视和平仇视民主的，中国人民只有把他们的彻底反动性看得透透彻彻，充分表现自己的伟大的不可战胜的力量的时候，中国的和平与民主才能得到真正的实现。毛主席号召我们：把悲痛变为力量，我们要用解放区的力量，用全国人民的力量，来继承先烈的遗愿，制止法西斯的反动，坚持三大协议，实现和平民主。\n    我们的力量在那里呢？在于我们能否把人民大众充分的发动起来，用自己的力量翻身起来，变成国家真正的主人翁；在于我们始终如一坚固不拔的团结。\n    去年反攻以来，全边区各地抓紧了诉苦复仇减租减息发动群众的中心环节，这是很对的，但是我们大家应该冷静的反省一下：发动群众工作做得够不够？是否有人只看到某些斗争方式上的不妥当（当然是应该纠正的）而高喊“左了”，实际把自己放在束手束脚，不敢大胆放手，甚至反对群众运动的地位上？是否懂得今天是发动不够而非“过火”？我们作群众工作的同志，是否还有不调查、不研究、粗枝大叶、单凭几条原则和主观要求去发动群众的毛病？是否还有“恩赐观点”包办代替的毛病？是否看到由于包办代替和主观主义的错误而使许多地方的群众没有真正发动起来，空白地方还很多的现象？是否还有侵犯中农利益等等违反政策的毛病？我们作城市工作的，是否犯了把农村的一套搬到城市的毛病？我们作工人运动的同志，是否懂得劳资两利发展生产的方针？是否有要求过高妨害了繁荣经济的毛病？我们军队的同志，是否以最大的热情去拥护人民的翻身运动？是否表现了人民军队的本质去积极的参加人民的翻身运动？是否还有人因为自己家庭被群众斗争而怀疑或反对群众运动？是否还有人因个别地方优抗不够或其他缺点而在感情上与群众运动对立起来？如果有这些缺点就要好好改正，因为人民大众得不到翻身就无从发挥力量，人民大众不充分发挥出自己的力量，和平民主的事业就无法实现，无法巩固。而我们领导和拥护人民的翻身，绝不能是空洞的概念，而要以具体的实际行动来表现。\n    这里，我们要谈一谈作风问题。毛主席教导我们，我们的作风是理论与实践一致的作风，是结合人民与人民利益相一致的作风，是自我批评的作风。有了这样的作风，我们才能真正做到为人民服务，当人民的勤务员。我们一定要警惕，在反攻以来，我们进入了中小城市，我们是否保持了艰苦奋斗与接近群众的作风？每个同志都想想，我有无享乐主义的思想？有无浪费的毛病？这点要引起我们严重的注意，如果这种现象发展起来，就一定要脱离群众、腐化自己、遗害党国。我们不反对在制度范围内各人应得的享受，我们不是提倡吃苦到底，但是必须使我们的生活与人民大众的生活不能相差太远，我们每一文钱的开支，都是人民付出的血汗。今天中国还是法西斯横行、大敌当前、八年抗战的创伤尚待医治，人民生活还是很苦的时候，如果不照顾人民的担负能力，如果浪费起来，我们必然脱离群众，招致失败。从前，李自成未到北京前，的确是作战勇敢，政策不坏，纪律良好，所以能够得到群众的拥护，获得胜利，不料一到北平，就对敌麻痹了，不讲政策了，脱离群众了，纪律败坏了，士无斗志了，短短的几十天，弄得功败垂成。大革命的后期，也有所谓“五皮主义”（指以有皮包、皮鞋、武装皮带、皮鞭、皮绑腿为荣），腐化了好多的革命战士，这些历史的教训，应引以为殷鉴。固然今天不同于大革命，更不同于李自成时代，因为有了以毛主席为首的共产党中央的领导，但不能说毛主席领导正确，我们各个区域，各个同志就当然正确，如果我们要想不犯错误或者少犯错误的话，就要实行毛主席的号召，警惕自己，反省自己，时常洗脸，检查工作，改进工作，能够这样，我们才能与人民站在一起，人民力量充分发挥起来了，我们才是不可战胜的力量。\n    讲到团结，我们是团结的，但是有无缺点呢？是有缺点的。拿军队与地方的关系来说，如果发生了不协调的现象，应该首先检查军队的责任，当然地方也应检查自己，互相着重自我批评，加以纠正。从整个关系说来，不能把地方的责任和军队的责任平列起来，因为历来的经验证明：只要军队对地方好，地方没有不对军队好的，军队对地方好一分，地方总是对军队好两分。还有一种说法是不对的，就是所谓民可爱政不可拥的糊涂观念，事实上政就是人民的政，不拥政的人也就不会爱民，拥政爱民是不能分开的。\n    最后，在悼念王若飞同志等的时候，我有两点感想，一点感想是这些同志个个都是经过几十年的锻炼，坚贞如一的为党和人民的事业奋斗，王叶两同志并在为党为人民事业斗争中，还坐了好几年的监牢，他们不计较个人的荣誉地位，不计较个人的享受，一心一意的为人民作事，对于他们的死，我们是万分沉痛的，我们更要学习他们不顾一切牺牲，终身献身革命的宝贵品质。一点感想是从我们党的历史证明：当我们违反了毛主席的思想和方针的时候，我们就必然要犯错误，就是很努力工作也做不出成绩来，甚至给革命以损害；当我们多少理解了毛主席的思想和切实执行毛主席的指示的时候，我们就可以发挥更多的作用，为人民做更多的事情，这些同志在毛主席的领导下，为了人民的利益，与反动派作不屈不挠的斗争，他们是毛主席的好学生，是群众的优秀领导者，他们的死怎能不令我们悲伤呢？！\n    同志们！团结在毛主席的周围，学习毛主席思想，锻炼出更多的毛主席的好学生来接替死者的岗位！用更大的努力，把群众发动起来，更亲密的团结起来，用我们的力量，用我们的团结，去制止反动派的阴谋，坚持三大协议，实现和平民主！只有这样，才能补救四月八日的损失，以慰死者的英灵！"

In Liangcheng County alone, more than 40 kinds of donations and taxes stipulated by the puppet Mengjiang government were abolished, with the tax amount reaching 160 million yuan, land tax of 135.564 million yuan, and special tax on opium prohibition of 11 million yuan, greatly reducing the burden on the people.

For example, the Zhuozi Mountain City government issued grain and money twice, enabling the broad masses to avoid freezing and starvation and transition to production. In the rural areas of Zhongyang, Daning, Yonghe and other places in southwestern Shanxi, due to the heavy destruction by the enemy puppets and Yan's troops, the grain shortage was extremely serious.

In the past, under the rule of the enemy and puppets, and under the unreasonable oppression of the managers in power, the workers here suffered to the extreme. Therefore, when our army entered the city, they welcomed us with full enthusiasm. Workers at the electricity company automatically cut off the power lines of the traitor Liu Ben Gong in the city. Workers at the bathhouses warmly comforted the soldiers. Many workers also volunteered to help the army carry ladders, transport the wounded, lead the way, and transport ammunition. Later, with the support of the democratic government, they began their liberation movement. After more than one hundred workers at Yutang Sauce Garden won the first rational struggle with the manager, they held three marches and demonstrations to improve their treatment. During the struggle, the workers themselves printed leaflets such as \"A Letter to Jining Workers,\" which won the sympathy of all citizens of Jining. Under the influence of the struggles of workers at Yutang and Yu Ji, eight printing houses including Cuihua, sauce gardens including Tianfu, Mashengtai, major woodworking factories including Wenju, cigarette factories including Tiansheng, and iron factories including Zhenhua, all increased wages through struggle. In mid-March, the first election of senators by workers was held, with secret ballots, and Liu Bantang, an old worker from Yutang, was honorably elected. Now, their living standards have improved, their enthusiasm for production has increased, and labor-management relations are close. Tiansheng and Dong Yuhua cigarette factories launched a major production competition, stipulating the conditions for production heroes. Under the workers' voluntary efforts, business at Yutang Sauce Garden is also more prosperous than before, so both labor and management are very satisfied.

    "content": "UNRRA Representative Surveys Qin River Breach\n　　KMT Troops Open Fire to Obstruct\n　　[Changzhi, 14th Dispatch] Mr. Bi Kaizhai of UNRRA, accompanied by Mr. Jin Guanglian of the Henan Branch of the Executive Headquarters, arrived in Wuzhi County, northern Henan, at the end of last month. Accompanied by Deputy County Magistrate Gong, they went to Donghongqiao on the south bank of the Qin River to survey the breach-closing project of the Qin River. Unexpectedly, KMT troops in the bunkers across the river deliberately obstructed them and opened fire, making it impossible to carry out the survey work. Both Mr. Bi and Mr. Jin expressed surprise at this. It is reported that before the Qin River changed its course, it flowed eastward from Donghongqiao, turning south at the city of Wuzhi County and flowing into the Yellow River. In June 1943, Zhang Jingzhong, the notoriously infamous KMT County Magistrate, and Meng Aowu, the district chief, in order to irrigate the vast land they had seized from the people, disregarded the people's lives and deaths and dug open the Qin River levee between Donghongqiao and Wuchekou. As a result, the Qin River changed its course from Donghongqiao to the southeast, flowing into the Yellow River in a new riverbed ten li wide and twenty li long, flooding more than seventy villages and more than two thousand hectares of fertile land, causing an unprecedented catastrophe for the people of Wuzhi. Last autumn, after our army liberated the entire territory of Wuzhi, the democratic government immediately planned to close the breach and return the Qin River to its old course. Subsequently, due to the KMT's attack and occupation of the county seat, this project was suspended.

    "content": "【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th】According to military news received by this agency today: (1) In the Northeast, the battle to defend Sipingjie has reached 26 days, and the city is still firmly defended by the Democratic Allied Forces. The morale of the Kuomintang troops is low, and they are now conscripting large numbers of Japanese prisoners of war. For example, the 87th Division secretly ordered the division to conscript 126 prisoners at a time. According to Moscow Radio: The Kuomintang is increasing its reinforcements equipped with American weapons, guaranteed by 2,000 US Marines stationed in Huludao to be sent to Shenyang. (2) In Jiangsu and Anhui, Kuomintang troops occupied Xiayi County, 100 kilometers west of Xuzhou, on the 10th. (3) In central Hebei, the puppet troops along the northern section of the Jinpu Railway continue to attack. On the 5th, the puppet Zhang Haiqing's troops launched a fierce attack on us from Fengjiakou Railway Station south of Cangzhou. The Eighth Route Army was forced to defend itself, repelled the army, and recovered Fengjiakou Railway Station and other places. In addition, the Kuomintang's 92nd Army and others on the Pinggu Road attacked the Chahar Liberated Area in Shunyi and Huairou. The 100th Regiment of the 34th Division of the Kuomintang's 72nd Army south of Huang'an, Hubei, occupied Zhangjiahe northwest of the town from Zhandian on the 6th, and launched an attack on the Shizi Shudian area on the 9th. Our army was forced to defend itself, repelled them, and recovered Zhangjiahe. However, the regiment continued to attack Zhangjiahe and other places. According to statistics from this agency, from the ceasefire order to the end of April, the Kuomintang army used a total force of more than 2.5 million, forcibly occupying 19 county towns and 210 villages and towns.\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th】Huaiyin Telegram: Kuomintang troops occupied Xiayi County in the Jiangsu-Anhui border region on the 10th. The city is located 100 kilometers west of Xuzhou, within Henan Province, belonging to the Eighth Sub-district of the Jiangsu-Anhui border region. Like Xiao County, it is a strategic point connecting the Jiangsu-Anhui border region, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region, and the eastern Henan Liberated Area. The Kuomintang army has occupied two county towns, Xiao County and Xiayi, within two weeks, showing that the operations outside the Northeast have now become serious. People here believe that whether the Peiping Executive Headquarters and the Xuzhou Group can force the Kuomintang army to quickly withdraw from these two county towns will be a major test of whether the ceasefire order has any binding force.\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 14th Urgent Telegram】Along the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, the arrogance of the puppet troops is increasing daily. In the month of April alone, they invaded the Liberated Area for more than 30 li and attacked more than 20 villages. The people of counties such as Jiaohe and Cangzhou have suffered deeply and have repeatedly requested rescue from the democratic government and the Eighth Route Army. The local military and political authorities, prioritizing the overall situation, have repeatedly advised, but all efforts have been ineffective, and they continue to suffer attacks. Finally, being forced to act, they implemented self-defense. On the evening of April 30, the strongholds of Nanpozi, Ershilitun, and Sundingtun, belonging to Jiaohe County, were recovered. On the 5th of this month, the puppet Zhang Haiqing's troops at Fengjiakou Railway Station, more than 20 li south of Cangzhou, fiercely attacked the Eighth Route Army in central Hebei. They were repelled, and Hongxindian, Fengjiakou Village, and Sanzhangzhuang, which had been liberated earlier but forcibly occupied by the puppet troops, were also recovered at the same time. The puppet troops retreated to Caizhuangzi and Fengjiakou Railway Station, holding them firmly and attacking, but due to the disintegration of military morale, they successively disintegrated. The Eighth Route Army recovered Caizhuangzi on the 6th and Fengjiakou Railway Station on the 7th. In this battle, more than 80 puppet soldiers were killed or wounded, more than 340 were captured, and more than 5 light machine guns and more than 500 rifles were seized.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    Zhongguo (China)\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n延安    Yan'an\n东北    Dongbei (Northeast)\n四平街  Sipingjie\n民主联军  Democratic Allied Forces\n国民党  Kuomintang\n莫斯科  Moscow\n葫芦岛  Huludao\n沈阳    Shenyang\n江苏    Jiangsu\n安徽    Anhui\n徐州    Xuzhou\n夏邑县  Xiayi County\n河北    Hebei\n津浦铁路  Jinpu Railway\n张海清  Zhang Haiqing\n沧州    Cangzhou\n冯家口车站 Fengjiakou Railway Station\n八路军  Eighth Route Army\n平古路  Pinggu Road\n顺义    Shunyi\n怀柔    Huairou\n察哈尔  Chahar\n黄安    Huang'an\n湖北    Hubei\n占店    Zhandian\n张家河  Zhangjiahe\n柿子树店 Shizi Shudian\n淮阴    Huaiyin\n苏皖边区  Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region\n萧县    Xiao County\n冀鲁豫边区 Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region\n豫东解放区 Eastern Henan Liberated Area\n北平执行部 Peiping Executive Headquarters\n河间    Hejian\n交河    Jiaohe\n南坡子  Nanpozi\n二十里屯 Ershilitun\n孙定屯  Sundingtun\n洪辛店  Hongxindian\n三张庄  Sanzhangzhuang\n蔡庄子  Caizhuangzi\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏皖国民党军侵陷夏邑城  中原冀中我军被迫自卫  收复张家河、冯家口车站等地\n\n1946-05-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏皖国民党军侵陷夏邑城\n    中原冀中我军被迫自卫\n    收复张家河、冯家口车站等地\n    【新华社延安十四日电】据今日本社收到的军事消息：（一）东北方面，四平街保卫战已达二十六天，该城仍在民主联军坚守中。国民党军士气低落，现征用大批日俘，如八十七师密令该师一次即征用一二六名。又据莫斯科广播：国民党正增调美械装备的援军，由在葫芦岛的美海军陆战队二千人保证开赴沈阳。（二）苏皖方面，国民党军队十日侵占徐州西一百公里的夏邑县城。（三）冀中方面，津浦北段沿线伪军不断进攻，五日伪张海清部，从沧州南之冯家口车站，向我猛攻，八路军被迫自卫，击退该军，并收复冯家口车站等地。此外平古路上之顺义，怀柔，国民党九十二军等进攻察哈尔解放区；湖北黄安以南国民党七十二军三十四师一百团，于六日由占店侵占该镇西北张家河后，九日向柿子树店一带进攻，我军被迫自卫，将其击退，并恢复张家河。但该团仍续向张家河等地进攻。根据本社统计，国民党军于停战令后至四月底，使用兵力共达二百五十余万，强占了十九座县城，二一○村镇。\n    【新华社延安十四日电】淮阴电：国民党军于十日侵占苏皖边区夏邑县城，该城位于徐州西一百公里，在河南境内，属苏皖边区八分区，与萧县同为联接苏皖边区、冀鲁豫边区及豫东解放区的战略要点。国民党军在两周内连占萧县、夏邑两个县城，显示东北以外的作战现已严重化，此间人士认为，北平执行部及徐州小组，能否迫令国民党军迅速退出这两个县城，将为停战令究竟有无约束力量的重大考验。\n    【新华社河间十四日急电】津浦北段沿线，伪军凶焰日张，仅四月份一个月内，即侵入解放区三十余里，进犯村庄二十余个。交河、沧州等县人民，因受害极深，纷纷向民主政府及八路军请求援救，地方军政当局仍以大局为重，多方规劝，均归无效，目继续遭受攻击，最后迫不得已，乃实行自卫，四月三十日晚，将交河县属之南坡子、二十里屯、孙定屯三处据点收复。本月五日，沧州南二十余里之冯家口车站伪军张海清部，又猛烈进攻冀中八路军，当被击退，早经解放，后被伪军强占之洪辛店、冯家口村、三张庄三地，亦经同时恢复，该伪即退至蔡庄子及冯家口车站内据坚攻击，但因军心焕散，相继解体，八路军于六日收复蔡庄子，七日收复冯家口车站。是役毙伤伪八十余名，俘三百四十余名，缴获轻机枪五挺，步枪五百余枝。"

    "title": "Handan's Poverty Relief Loans",
    "author": "Wu Xiang",
    "date": "1946-05-17",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Handan's Poverty Relief Loans\n    Wu Xiang\n            A Wooden Beam\n    In February of this year, the Handan branch of the Jinnan Bank in Jinnan bought a wooden beam and placed it in the Second Market, intending to use it for building houses. The next day, bank staff discovered that the beam had been moved from its original location and was lying in the stall of a small vendor named Cheng Huian. How did it get there? Cheng Huian invited several people to carry it there. He saw in the evening that no one from the bank was watching over it and, fearing it would be stolen, decided to do so. He also said to everyone, \"The bank today is different from the past; it helps us poor people become prosperous. If the beam is stolen, it's a loss for us poor people.\"\n    This Cheng Huian is a loan recipient from the Jinnan Bank. From the time it opened in Handan until the end of April this year, the Jinnan Bank issued a total of 1.7 million yuan in poverty relief loans, distributed to approximately 520 impoverished households, totaling over 4,000 people. The highest loan amount per household was 10,000 yuan, and the lowest was 1,500 yuan. Most loans ranged between 3,000 and 5,000 yuan. A small portion was interest-free, while the majority carried a monthly interest rate of one percent. These loans allowed many impoverished and helpless rickshaw pullers, artisans, and small vendors selling snacks and sundries to maintain and improve their lives, gradually rising economically. According to inspections in individual areas at the end of April, those who managed their businesses poorly broke even after covering living expenses; those who managed them well earned profits close to the principal amount, in addition to their living expenses. Therefore, almost all loans were repaid on time, without any delays. Song Pingfang in the train station area was extremely worried in December of last year because he had no rice or firewood. He borrowed 2,000 yuan from the bank, made iron cage fences, and four months later, he repaid the loan. After deducting living expenses for his family of three, he still had 2,500 yuan in cash and raw materials.\n    From this, we can understand why Cheng Huian wanted to move the wooden beam bought by the bank to his stall. We can also understand why all the loan recipients were so affectionate towards the bank staff. During the New Year, loan recipients would desperately try to pull the bank staff into their homes, saying, \"My house is dirty, and I don't have anything good to eat, but you can at least sit down!\"\n            New Problems\n    The democratic government of the liberated areas, leading all the people, sharing weal and woe, and overcoming the consecutive severe disasters of 1942 and 1943, is a miracle in Chinese history. However, under the pressure of famine in the enemy-occupied areas, large numbers of bankrupt farmers had no choice but to leave their homes, already devoid of everything, with tears in their eyes, and go to the transportation lines to work as coolies or pull rickshaws for a living. Thus, the number of poor people in Handan increased. Although there are no precise statistics, there are at least 7,000 people, not counting the surrounding villages, with the most coming from Daming. These people suffered the oppression of the enemy and puppets and struggled on the brink of starvation day and night. Now that they are liberated and have received loans from the bank, they can at least set up a small stall to sell snacks and sundries. In fact, most of them are setting up small stalls because: (1) the poor lack capital, and this kind of business requires the least capital; (2) it doesn't require any special skills, and men, women, the elderly, and the young can all participate; (3) the profit is reliable; if there are buyers, there is profit, and there is no risk of losing money. However, as the number of vendors continues to increase, sales are limited, which inherently creates competition and lowers profits. Thus, a new problem is raised: after the masses have solved their urgent living difficulties, they demand more loans to do bigger business and get rich faster. However, the scope of activity of the average poor person is small, their commercial experience is not rich, and in the face of fluctuating prices, the risk of losing money far outweighs the hope of making money.\n    To solve this problem and overcome this speculative tendency, we need to guide them from operating consumer goods to production, adopt a business model based on labor and supplemented by capital, and develop transportation, handicraft production, and small workshops.\n    However, how should we start doing this?\n    In mid-March, Liu Yushan of Gu Yi Shi (second-hand clothing market) requested a loan to fry sesame candy. After investigation, the comrades of the Handan branch of the Jinnan Bank learned that he had a small earthen cart, was physically strong, and was from Daming. Therefore, they advised him to engage in transportation, transporting coal from Handan to Daming and selling oil on the return trip, once every ten days, earning around a thousand yuan besides his living expenses. With his agreement, he was loaned 5,000 yuan for a term of three months. After a month and a half, they went to check and found that his inventory and cash exceeded 7,000 yuan. He said very excitedly, \"The plan the bank helped me make is really good; I'm sure I can earn 5,000 yuan in three months.\"\n    Zhang Qin was also from Gu Yi Shi. He requested a loan in early April to set up a small stall. The comrades from the bank discovered that his neighbor had a mill that happened to be lacking a livestock animal. So, they advised him to partner with his neighbor and loaned him 10,000 yuan to buy a donkey. The neighbor was also very happy. He recently ran to the bank and said, \"There's no problem; I'll definitely earn the cost of the donkey back in three months.\"\n    Concrete facts clarify the path that people have already been exploring. And they suggest what the correct approach should be.\n            Democratic Appraisal and Group Leaders\n    Who should get a loan? How much should they get? Only by adopting the mass line can it be resolved satisfactorily.\n    The first batch of loans had a relief nature, and were issued as soon as Handan was liberated. The bank sent people to work with comrades leading mass work, issuing loans on one hand and organizing the masses on the other. Loans were subject to democratic appraisal by each group. The groups were divided according to residence, and everyone was a neighbor and very familiar with each other. Therefore, the allocation of loans would be fair and reasonable, and the use would be clear, so that people wouldn't borrow money without working. Asking them to find shop guarantors would be unreasonable. In fact, they supervise each other, creating a chain guarantee, which is even better than shop guarantors. \"Borrow well and repay well, and it will be easy to borrow again\" is already a very loud slogan among them. A former puppet soldier from Jiao Yao Jie (Jiao Kiln Street) requested a loan. Many people said during the appraisal, \"The bank's loans are to help us poor people turn over and become prosperous. You were a traitor. If you don't repent and reform, you can't be given a loan.\"\n    After discovering loyal and reliable activists in the groups, they were further cultivated to become a bridge connecting the bank and the masses. The method was to constantly talk to them about the bank's loan policies, increase their political awareness and sense of responsibility, understand other borrowers through them, and entrust them to introduce new borrowers. During the election of the loan group, these activists would often be elected as group leaders. These group leaders became the best assistants for the bank's loan work. For example, He Rongtian of Gu Yi Shi and Zhang Ming of Xi Xie Zhuang (West Xie Village) often went to each household in their group to check, inquiring about their business conditions, introducing the business methods of other households, helping them make plans, and urging them to repay the loans on time, carrying out all the work that the bank needed to do but could not.\n            Further Steps\n    On the evening of May 6th, the Banking Operations Department conducted a review and study of the loan work in Handan City.\n    It can be said that the work has been very successful. However, they also raised the following points:\n    1. The distribution of loans has not been completely fair. Group leaders are relatively active, but sometimes they cannot take care of more people. Some people who are desperately poor haven't received a single penny, while some families of three have borrowed three times under different names. Therefore, they decided to send people to do more in-depth visits among the masses and conduct further checks and education on the group leaders.\n    2. Making loans develop towards production has not been done seriously. If it has been done, it is only the beginning; it is not systematic or planned. Therefore, after research, they divided the loans into three standards: (1) those who have production conditions but lack funds; (2) those who have neither production conditions nor funds; (3) those who operate consumer goods. Loan recipients who meet the first two standards will be given preferential treatment in terms of amount and duration, while the latter will be treated more strictly. And they will continue to promote the spirit of in-depth investigation and research, guiding the masses to engage in production.\n    People who faithfully serve the people often review their work in such a courageous and serious manner. And this review helps them to better serve the people further.

Twenty-five women representatives, carrying infants, demanded to enter the palace, asking Emperor Hirohito to respond to their demands made on the 12th to open the granaries to relieve famine victims and establish a democratic government. At the same time, they wanted to get milk for the babies, but were blocked by the Imperial Palace guards and pushed out of the palace. Many protesters surged forward, surrounding the guards. An army captain clashed with the demonstrators. When the guards and police on duty outside rushed in, the demonstration leader shouted to maintain order, saying: \"Their refusal to meet our representatives is a trick, trying to provoke us into unrest, so they can use military and police force to defeat us. Let's not be fooled, let us achieve victory.\" One of the demonstration leaders, Communist Party member Yan Tao, condemned the authorities for violating their promise on the 12th to allow 30 representatives to meet on the 14th. The demonstrators sat on the ground and staged a spirited sit-down for up to five hours, waiting for Hirohito to personally respond to their demands. The Yomiuri Shimbun published the situation on the 12th when Japanese demonstrators entered the forbidden area of the Imperial Palace for the first time in Japanese history. They forcibly inspected the warehouses of Imperial Palace personnel and senior government officials, discovering a large amount of grain and a great deal of seafood, while the people are facing famine. The newspaper said: \"Three full buckets of leftover rice were seen in the Imperial Palace, which Tokyo workers cannot afford.\"\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n东京    Dōngjīng (Tokyo)\n皇宫    Huánggōng (Imperial Palace)\n裕仁    Yùrén (Hirohito)\n延安    Yán'ān\n新华社  Xīnhuá Shè (Xinhua News Agency)\n盐鼗    Yán Táo\n读卖新闻  Dúmài xīnwén (Yomiuri Shimbun)\n共产党    Gòngchǎndǎng (Communist Party)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东京两千妇女饥民再赴皇宫示威索粮  并要求建立日本民主政府\n\n1946-05-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东京两千妇女饥民再赴皇宫示威索粮\n    并要求建立日本民主政府\n    【新华社延安十五日电】东京讯：继十二日一千二百日人举行皇宫请愿后，昨日又有二千名妇女，手执旗帜，举行皇宫示威。二十五个妇女代表肩负婴儿，要求入宫，请日皇裕仁回答她们十二日提出的打开仓库存米赈济饥民建立民主政府的要求。同时，她们欲为婴儿索取牛奶，但为皇宫警卫所阻，并将她们推出宫外，许多游行者即蜂涌上前，将警卫包围，警卫某上尉与示威者发生冲突，门外布岗和警察急趋赴内时，示威领袖高呼遵守秩序，并称：“他们拒绝接见我们代表，是一种诡计，想以此激起我们骚动，然后他们好用军警武力来打败我们，我们不要上当吧，让我们得到胜利”。示威领袖之一共产党员盐鼗，谴责当局违反十二日曾允许十四日接见三十名代表之诺言。示威者席地而坐，并激昂高傲静坐达五小时，等待裕仁亲自回答要求。读卖新闻刊载十二日日本有史以来日本示威者首次进入皇宫禁地情形，他们强行观察了皇宫人员及高级政府官员的库房，发现其中有大量粮食以及极多海味，而人民则正面临饥馑。该报称：“皇宫内看到三满桶吃剩的米饭，正是东京劳动者所不能到口的”。"

    "content": "Human Hell - Yongnian City\n    Fang De\n    The \"Record of Compatriots Trapped in Yongnian City,\" published in the Beiping Huabei Daily on May 5th, uses the words of traitors entrenched in Yongnian City, disguising them as the voice of the \"people\" to deceive the masses. Now, let me bring the voice of the people's accusations to the readers:\n            One: Flooding and Siege, Sucking Marrow\n    The veteran traitors who have been massacring the people of Southern Hebei for eight years, including Tie Motou (许铁英 Xu Tieying), the commander of the puppet Southern Hebei Jing'an Independent Brigade, Wang Zemin, the deputy commander of the puppet Yongnian Security Joint Force, and Wang Guanwu, the captain of the puppet Jize County Security Brigade, have been entrenched in Yongnian City since the enemy surrendered.\n    When Wang Guanwu took over from Wang Zemin and entrenched himself in Dongqiao Village (five li east of the city) on September 19th, in order to prevent our army from liberating Yongnian City, Wang Guanwu breached the Puyang River openings on the north and south sides of the village, leading water into the moat. Before the flooding, the main roads from the four gates outside the city to the city were also dug into deep trenches like the moat, cutting off the connection between the gates and the city. The city became the center, and the water surface was three to five li wide. The gates and the city were like five isolated islands submerged in the surrounding 45-li small lake. Fifteen thousand mu of fertile land in the surrounding nineteen villages were turned into lakebeds, and the people trapped in the city could no longer get out!\n    In the small city of 25,000 people, the amount of money extorted before the New Year reached 1.8 million yuan. Wealthy merchants were continuously forced to donate. The donation slips filled baskets, and tax collectors crowded the doors. Fan Boxi on Beidajie was forced to donate 7 million, and Guo Lansun, the owner of Taiji on Nandajie, was forced to death. The total amount of donations from wealthy households reached 9 million. The bones of the people in the city were crushed. As many as 300 people were forced to death because they could not afford the burden. During the Lunar New Year, the puppet troops even more frantically looted the remaining grain of the people. For example, when the five families of Xi Ji on Tupo Street were not found to have grain, his wife was dragged to the pillbox and gang-raped. During the New Year period, as many as 50 people died of starvation every day. Now, the surviving people are still burdened with 20 million \"circulation coupons,\" and prices are rising so terribly. Last December, an egg cost 70 yuan, but by April of this year, it had risen to 500 yuan. Now, 800 yuan can only buy a two-tael sesame seed cake.\n            Two: People Starve, Traitor Pigs Fatten\n    From the beginning of February this year, Kuomintang transport planes have been delivering grain to support the puppet troops in the city. Only their \"National Army\" and Yang Yicai and his like, who used to be enemies' county magistrates but are now officials of the Kuomintang government, get the large flatbreads dropped from the sky. The people in the city get nothing. A refugee from Huopai Shijie who escaped to Dongqiao complained bitterly: a flatbread smashed the house and fell into the home. He was so hungry that he picked up some flatbread crumbs to eat and was beaten severely. The gifts the people received from the Kuomintang transport planes were: people were killed by the flatbreads, and houses were smashed. Now, according to the reporter, three people have died from such misfortune, and nine out of ten houses have been smashed.\n    Two planes fly over the city every day, threatening the lives and homes of the people twice a day. On average, five planes supply 15,000 jin of flatbread every day. There are only 2,000 active puppet troops and members of puppet organizations, and 4,800 dependents. These pigs eat their fill, while nearly 6,000 people are starving. Although the traitors use hunger to threaten them to join their ranks, many people with national integrity would rather die than submit!\n    In the city, you can see two kinds of people: one is the refugees who are yellow-faced and emaciated, with sunken eyes, lying by the street with only a breath left, or those who are gathering algae by the water's edge to survive, struggling towards death. The other is men and women with ruddy complexions. You can't find a trace of hunger on these people! Wang Zemin even uses 200 jin of flatbread every day to feed his three fat pigs and more than forty piglets. In the still of the night, you can hear the barking of the officials' fat dogs; at dawn, you can hear the rooster crowing!\n    There is no land in the city, and the people have no vegetables to eat, and many suffer from night blindness and hemorrhagic diseases. But the traitors can eat cod liver oil and canned beef sent from airplanes!\n            Three: Rescue\n    The city walls of Yongnian are as flat as the Puyang Riverbed. In order to rescue the people, the Eighth Route Army, at the request of the people, captured Dongqiao on the morning of November 28th and immediately blocked the breach in the afternoon. Therefore, the river water did not rise to the city gate. On December 1st, the democratic government mobilized 2,623 people from the liberated areas to dig drainage ditches, and later rescued the people from the city to land from the water.\n    The people could no longer survive. On February 14th, there was a spontaneous struggle to leave the city. The traitors were also trying to release a group of consuming population, so they released more than 5,000 unarmed old, weak, women, and children, while detaining the able-bodied men who supported these people, to continue to enslave and exploit them, and attempted to starve the women and children to death in the liberated areas!\n    The puppet troops' small rafts had just ferried the old, weak, women, and children across half a li of water, when, on the pretext of fearing that the Eighth Route Army would detain the boats, they pushed them all into the water one by one. The water was deep and the road was long. For a time, only a cry of sorrow could be heard on the broad water surface. Three people were drowned alive in Beiguan. The Eighth Route Army soldiers, who were eagerly waiting on the shore, jumped into the icy water to rescue them, regardless of their own safety. Some of them could no longer speak. The democratic government lit a big fire in Dangtou Village to bake them and cooked porridge to feed them. Their bodies warmed up, and their stomachs heated up, before they could speak and stand up. The government also gave each of them ten jin of emergency relief rice and introduced them to live in nearby villages. The second time, on March 11th, the task force brought out more than 3,000 people. Together with those who had escaped at ordinary times, there were a total of 18,000 people. Among them, 8,000 people who had no ability to survive received government relief.\n    The government led them to make straw waistcoats, weave cattail fans, knit nets, and do small businesses, earning up to 100 yuan a day. Their household chores have been initially established, but they are not doing well enough. Therefore, they still have serious difficulties!\n            Four: What Do They Need?\n    What do they need?\n    Wang Zuoxin, a 60-year-old representative from Beijie who came to the liberated area to receive relief grain, said: \"The people in the city need to come out! But the traitors won't let them!\" His old tears accompanied his low voice to the ground... Chen Shanzhu, a small boatman from Dongguan, told me that although three people had drowned, people still swam out of the city at night from Dongmen to escape to the liberated area.\n    Zhang Yinzheng, from the entrance of Beidajie Road West, and his three brothers were forced to become puppet soldiers. His third brother died of injuries last year. He understood that this disaster was given to them by the traitors. In mid-April, the two brothers successively escaped from the city, swam to the liberated area, and handed over their guns to the Eighth Route Army. The puppet soldiers in Jize, Nanguan, had long asked to be disarmed and return to farming. But until now, they are still being ruled and driven by the puppet military leaders who kill without blinking an eye.\n    On May 1st, when I arrived at Nanqiao in the liberated area, I saw that among the hundred people brought out of the city by Mr. Heng Anshi, an American from the relief team, there were seventeen children and eighty-three women. The refugees standing on the shore looked at the city, and hundreds of hearts hoped that their children and husbands would come out to support them. However, the traitors were unwilling to release one!\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n永年城\tYongnian Cheng (Yongnian City)\n方德\tFang De\n北平华北日报\tBeiping Huabei Daily (Beiping North China Daily)\n永年城同胞被困记\tYongnian Cheng Tongbao Bei Kun Ji (Record of Compatriots Trapped in Yongnian City)\n人民\tRenmin (People)\n冀南\tJi Nan (Southern Hebei)\n铁磨头\tTie Motou\n许铁英\tXu Tieying\n伪冀南靖安独立旅\tWei Ji Nan Jing'an Duli Lü (Puppet Southern Hebei Jing'an Independent Brigade)\n王泽民\tWang Zemin\n伪永年保安联队\tWei Yongnian Bao'an Liandui (Puppet Yongnian Security Joint Force)\n王冠五\tWang Guanwu\n伪鸡泽县保安大队\tWei Jize Xian Bao'an Dadui (Puppet Jize County Security Brigade)\n东桥村\tDongqiao Cun (Dongqiao Village)\n滏阳河\tPuyang He (Puyang River)\n北大街\tBeidajie (North Main Street)\n范伯西\tFan Boxi\n南大街\tNandajie (South Main Street)\n泰记\tTai Ji\n郭兰荪\tGuo Lansun\n土坡街\tTupo Jie (Tupo Street)\n席集五家\tXi Ji Wu Jia\n流通券\tLiutongquan (Circulation Coupon)\n国民党\tGuomindang (Kuomintang)\n杨异才\tYang Yicai\n火牌什街\tHuopai Shijie\n民主政府\tMinzhu Zhengfu (Democratic Government)\n党头村\tDangtou Cun (Dangtou Village)\n南桥\tNanqiao (South Bridge)\n恒安石\tHeng Anshi\n美国人\tMeiguoren (American)\n北街\tBeijie (North Street)\n王作新\tWang Zuoxin\n东关\tDongguan (East Gate)\n陈珊珠\tChen Shanzhu\n张印证\tZhang Yinzheng\n南关\tNanguan (South Gate)\n鸡泽\tJize\n好好学习，天天向上 Study every day and improve every day\n八路军\tBalujun (Eighth Route Army)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 人间地狱——永年城\n方德\n1946-05-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　人间地狱——永年城\n    方德\n    北平华北日报五月五日发表《永年城同胞被困记》一篇通讯，把盘踞永年城的汉奸们的话，借“人民”的口吻说出来欺骗人民。现在，让我将人民控诉的声音带给读者：\n            一  放水围困，敲骨吸髓\n    残杀冀南人民八年的老牌汉奸伪冀南靖安独立旅长铁磨头（即许铁英）、伪永年保安联队副王泽民及伪鸡泽县保安大队长王冠五，从敌人投降到现在，就一直盘踞着永年城。\n    当王冠五九月十九接替王泽民盘踞东桥村（城东五里）时，为了阻止我大军解放永年城，王冠五在村南北两面决开滏阳河口，引水灌入护城河，灌水前把城外四关通至城内的大道也挖成和城河一样的横断深沟，切断关城的联系，以城为中心，水面宽到三华里到五华里，关和城像五个孤岛沉在周围四十五华里的小湖里。周围十九个村的一万五千亩良田变成了湖底，被水围在城里的人民再也出不来了！\n    二万五千人的小城在年前被强征款项达一百八十万元之多，不断强征富商大贾，他们捐条满筐，税丁盈门，北大街范伯西被强捐七百万，南大街泰记老板郭兰荪被捐逼死。综计富户捐款达九百万。城内人民骨头都榨碎了，因负担不起而被逼死的达三百人之多。伪军在旧历年关更疯狂搜掠人民仅存的余粮，如土坡街席集五家没搜出粮食，他老婆就被抓到炮楼上轮奸。在年关期中被逼死饿死的每天有五十人之多；现在在仅存的活人身上还负担二千万“流通券”，物价涨得这么可怕：去年十二月一个鸡蛋七十元，到今年四月就涨到五百元。现在八百元只能买一个二两重的烧饼。\n            二  人民肚饥，汉奸猪肥\n    从今年二月一开始，国民党的运输机就输送粮食接济城里的伪军了。投下的大饼只有他们的“国军”和曾是敌人的县长，而今是国民党政府的命官杨异才之流才有份，在城里的人民是得不到什么的，火牌什街一个逃到东桥的难民哭诉着：饼砸塌了房子，掉在家里，饿得慌了拾点儿饼屑来吃还挨了一顿毒打。人民所得国民党运输机的赐予是：人被大饼砸死，房子被砸破，现在，据记者所知受到这种不幸灾祸而致死的已有三个，十家有九家的房子都被砸破了。\n    每天两趟飞机飞临上空，人民的生命和房屋也就受到两次威胁。平均每天五架飞机供应一万五千斤大饼，现役伪军伪组织人员只有两千，伪属四千八百，这些猪吃胀破了肚皮，而近六千的人民却在挨饿，汉奸们虽用饥饿来威胁他们入伙；但许多富有民族气节的人民却宁死不屈！\n    在城里可以看见两种人：一种是面黄饥瘦，眼睛深陷，躺在街旁只剩一口气的灾民，或者在水边捞水藻过生活、向死亡挣扎的人们。另一种却是肤色丰润的男女，在这种人身上找不着一点饥饿的形色！王泽民每天还用二百斤大饼喂他的三口肥猪和四十多个猪娃，夜深人静时，还可以听到官家肥狗的狂吠；黎明还可以听到公鸡唱晓！\n    城里没有二分地，人民没菜吃，多害鸡宿眼和破血病；可是汉奸们却能吃到从飞机上送来的鱼肝油和罐头牛肉！\n            三  抢救\n    永年城楼和滏阳河床一样平，八路军为了抢救人民，在十一月二十八日午前应人民之请攻克东桥，午后就抢堵了决口。所以河水没有上升到城门口。十二月一日，民主政府又发动解放区群众二千六百二十三人抢挖排水沟，以后从水里把城内人民抢救到陆地上来。\n    人民再也活不下去了，在二月十四来了一次自发的出城斗争。汉奸们也正在想法要推出一批消费的人口，所以就放出五千多赤手空拳的老弱妇孺，而把养活这些人的青壮年全都扣留下来，供他们继续奴役剥削，并企图把妇孺们饿死在解放区里！\n    伪军的小筏子刚把老弱妇孺们渡过半里多远的水面，借口怕八路军扣留船只就一个个都推下水去，水深路远，广阔的水面上一时只听得一片哀号，北关就活活淹死了三个，在岸边殷殷守候的八路军战士们，奋不顾身，纷纷跳入刺骨的水里把他们救起来，他们已经有一部分人不能说话了。民主政府在党头村烧了大火给他们烤，煮了稀饭喂到他们嘴里。他们的身上暖了，肚里热了，才能说出话来，才能站得起来。政府又发给他们每人十斤急赈米，介绍他们到附近村子居住，第二次是三月十一执行小组把他们带出了三千多，连平时逃出来的一共综计有一万八千人。其中没有生存能力而得到政府救济的达八千人。\n    政府领导他们搓草腰，编蒲扇，织网子，作小生意，每天可以获得百元以内的收入，他们家务已初步建立起来；但作得还不够好，因此，他们还存在严重的困难！\n            四  他们需要什么？\n    他们需要什么呢？\n    一个出城来解放区领救济粮的北街代表六十老人王作新说：“城里人需要出来！可是汉奸不让啊！”龙钟老泪伴随着他低沉的声音落在地上……东关小船夫陈珊珠告诉我虽已淹死了三个人，但东门每天晚上还是有人泅水出城，逃到解放区来。\n    北大街口路西张印证弟兄三个都被迫当了伪军，他三弟在去年受伤死去，他明白这个灾祸是汉奸们赐予的，四月中旬弟兄两个先后坠城泅水到解放区把枪交给了八路军，住南关鸡泽的伪军们早就要求解除武装，归田务农；可是直到现在，他们仍被杀人不眨眼的伪军头子们继续统治驱使着。\n    五月一日我到达解放区的南桥，看到救济小组的美国人恒安石先生从城里带出的百人中，有十七个小孩，八十三个女人和站在岸边的难民们看着城里，成百的心期待着她们的孩子、丈夫出来养活他们，可是，汉奸们并不愿放出一个！"

It is reported that Azerbaijan Premier Pishvari has returned to Tabriz with his delegation. When Iranian Premier Sultani announced the deadlock in negotiations on Tehran Radio on the 13th, he stated, \"Further discussions will be held in the future.\" It is reported that Iranian reactionaries constantly exerted pressure on Premier Sultani throughout the negotiations. The reactionaries believe that they have an opportunity after the Soviet withdrawal, and therefore, on one hand, deployed heavy troops on the Azerbaijan border to carry out provocations, and on the other hand, demanded that Sultani force Pishvari to submit. The reactionaries insisted that the governor of Azerbaijan Province should be appointed by the central government, that the army and gendarmerie should be commanded by the central government, that land reform should be cancelled, that land should be returned to landlords, and threatened Sultani. Tabriz Radio, in its recent broadcasts, severely condemned the Iranian reactionaries for being responsible for the failure of the negotiations. The broadcast declared that the freedom obtained by the people of Azerbaijan through decades of struggle cannot be taken away.

    "content": "Liu Maoen Plots to Eliminate the Yüdong Liberated Area\n    Conspiracy Exposed in Plan\n    Orders Stipulate: Numbers Use Code Names, Military Uniforms Exchanged for Plain Clothes\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 15th] This reporter today obtained a copy of the Kuomintang's plan to launch a large-scale attack on our Yüdong Liberated Area. The plan was \"in accordance with Director Liu Maoen's Youji telegram order,\" attempting to \"thoroughly eliminate\" our Yüdong Liberated Area troops. \"Special care must be taken to prevent bandits from fleeing northwest and southeast.\" The order stipulates that \"all suppression troops must change into plain clothes.\" Regarding identification marks, the plan states: Our (the Kuomintang referring to themselves) suppression troops should use towels or other items to wrap around their necks on the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th of each month; tie them on their left arms on the 2nd, 5th, and 8th; and tie them on their right arms on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th. Regardless of suppression, defense, or mobile units, they should not wear armbands or symbols, as well as numbers or names. Even if there are papers with numbers or names, they should all use code names or aliases when issuing orders and communicating.\" The plan stipulates that Tian Zhenzhou be changed to \"Shou Ce,\" and the code word be \"Ji.\" The plan stipulates that the troops participating in the attack on our Yüdong Liberated Area include Mi Wenhe's 181st Division, Ge Kaixiang's 81st Division with five battalions, six provincial and special district security regiments, two regiments of the Fourth Detachment, and security teams from fifteen counties. The plan's supplementary note also stipulates that \"each county and district should raise one month's worth of supplies on its own.\"\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 15th] Following the talks between the two chiefs of staff in Xinxiang, and Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters Chief of Staff Zhao Zili's unreasonable denial of the existence of our Yüdong Liberated Area, the Kuomintang again submitted a memorandum to the Xinxiang group on May 8th, still denying the fact that our Eighth Route Army existed in Yüdong before January 14th. This reporter visited the authorities of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region on this matter. The military region authorities presented the original letter from the 119th Division of the 68th Army to our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Yüdong Military Sub-district Commander Jin Keqin on January 14th. The letter roughly stated: \"I have long admired your military prowess and deeply regret not having had the opportunity to meet you! Our two sides are temporarily hostile. Now, our government and your representatives have agreed on measures to cease conflict and have promulgated the following orders (omitted). Our side has now implemented the above orders. We hope that your side will send personnel to contact us to avoid misunderstandings,\" and so on. This letter was sent by the Kuomintang military high command to our Eighth Route Army in Yüdong the day after the ceasefire order took effect on January 13th. Our army immediately sent a staff officer to make contact after receiving the letter. The factual evidence is all there. Whether or not there was an Eighth Route Army in the Yüdong area before January 14th is clear at a glance. Now, the Kuomintang army repeatedly denies our Yüdong Liberated Area, and then secretly arranges the encirclement and suppression by more than 30,000 people.

Method: Only two and a half jin of caustic soda and two jin of salt are dissolved in water, and electricity is passed through it, and its effectiveness is the same as that of an electric welding machine. The second is that, after joint research by Factory Director Zhang and squad leader Yao Wenqing and other comrades, a six-foot lathe was modified into an eight-foot lathe, which can repair slightly larger machines. The third is the method of repairing light bulbs invented by Comrade Wang Guoquan of the Electrical Factory: In the past, if the metal connector (with screws or hooks) on the light bulb fell off, it could not be used. After research, Comrade Wang used a mixture of fine sand, hide glue, and fish glue to make a soft paste, which is very strong and durable after being glued on and dried. Previously, if the external wire of the light bulb was broken, it was thought to be broken. Comrade Wang connected the soft wire (fuse) to the broken part, then connected the metal connector with a thick and hard wire, and then glued the head with a self-made soft paste, which is very durable. These inventions of the workers and comrades will ensure the smooth completion of the May Great Production, and with high production enthusiasm, they are continuing to study various technologies and want to invent more things.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n峰峰\tFengfeng\n利民煤矿\tLimin Coal Mine\n赵金清\tZhao Jinqing\n张厂长\tFactory Director Zhang\n姚文庆\tYao Wenqing\n王国荃\tWang Guoquan\n晋冀鲁豫总分社\tJin-Ji-Lu-Yu General Branch\n五月大生产运动\tMay Great Production Movement\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 利民煤矿职工  红五月中发明多\n\n1946-05-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　利民煤矿职工\n    红五月中发明多\n    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社讯】峰峰利民煤矿职工，在新近发动的五月大生产运动中，已有几种发明：第一种是铁工班长赵金清同志经过苦心研究所发明的一种简便电焊机。制法：只用二斤半火碱和二斤食盐，溶化在水里，使电气通过，其效能即与电焊机一样。第二种是经过张厂长与班长姚文庆等同志共同研究，把六尺旋床改制为八尺旋床，能修理稍大的机器了。第三种是电气厂王国荃同志发明的修灯泡办法：过去电灯泡上的金属活头（有螺丝的，有挂钩的）一掉下来即不能用了，王同志研究后，用细砂子、皮胶、鳔胶三种东西合成软膏，粘上以后晾干，非常坚固耐用。从前电灯泡外部的导线断了，便以为坏了，王同志把软性导线（保险丝）接连断处，再用粗硬导线连结金属活头，然后用自制的软膏粘头，十分耐用。职工同志们这些发明，将保证五月大生产的顺利完成，他们在高度生产热情下，正在继续研究各种技术，要发明更多的东西。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-05-18",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Shameful Ta Kung Pao Editorial\n    ——New China Daily, Chongqing, April 18 Editorial\n    The Ta Kung Pao in Chongqing and Shanghai published an editorial these past two days titled \"The Shameful Battle of Changchun.\" This is a shameful editorial by Ta Kung Pao, and we feel sorry for Ta Kung Pao after reading it.\n    This editorial acknowledges that the Northeast problem involves internal affairs, that the civil war in the Northeast is heartbreaking, and that the ceasefire order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference have not been implemented. But who doesn't acknowledge that the Northeast problem involves internal affairs? Who is undermining the ceasefire order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference? The Chinese people and people abroad all know that this is due to the \"stubborn elements\" of the Kuomintang, as General Marshall put it. Not only does Ta Kung Pao not dare to speak this simple truth, but it also uses the Battle of Changchun as a pretext to insinuate and blame the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, thereby exonerating the stubborn faction and helping them as accomplices. This is truly shameful!\n    The Kuomintang reactionaries have launched a civil war for at least seven months, and have been waging civil war in the Northeast for at least five months, using American guns to massacre their own compatriots. Since January of this year, they have attacked Yingkou, Jianchang, Fuxin, Panshan, Liaozhong, Tai'an, Fushun, Liaoyang, Tieling, Haicheng, Anshan, Dashiqiao, Kaiyuan, Faku, Changtu, Benxihu, Gaiping, and Sipingjie, attacking so many places and violating the two ceasefire agreements of January 13 and March 27. Yet, we have not heard Ta Kung Pao utter a single word of \"shameful\" about these crimes. Now, regarding the \"Battle of Changchun,\" Ta Kung Pao suddenly says this battle is \"shameful.\" For the editorial writers of Ta Kung Pao, anything the Kuomintang fascist reactionaries do to strike at the people, harm the people, tear up promises, and launch civil wars, no matter how big, is not \"shameful.\" Only when the people fight back against such reactionaries does it become intolerable, does it become \"shameful.\" The Ta Kung Pao editorial writers are so opposed to the people, it should be \"shameful\" enough, right?\n    The Ta Kung Pao editorial writers say, \"The Northeast belongs to the country.\" Very well, may I ask what country you are talking about? Is it a country under the one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang? Or is it a democratic country of the Chinese people? Under the former country, the receiving personnel \"ascend to the five sons status,\" bureaucratic capital makes a fortune, and secret service atrocities emerge endlessly. There, the so-called \"victory disaster\" occurs, the number of famine victims exceeds three times that of Europe, and the national industry closes down. The people gnaw on tree bark and grass roots. One in ten women in Hankou is a prostitute, and human flesh in Guangzhou's human flesh market is cheap, only worth ten cigarettes. \"The Northeast belongs to the country.\" Is the Northeast part of this kind of \"country\"? The people across the country have suffered enough from this kind of \"country.\" Should the people of the Northeast, after suffering the pain of fourteen years of national subjugation, obediently accept the suffering of this kind of \"country\"? China can have a good country, the prototype of which has already been seen in the liberated areas. If the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference are implemented, the whole country can slowly build a democratic new country based on this prototype, a country where the people truly have sovereignty. To say nothing else, the liberated areas at least do not have \"receiving officials who ascend to the five sons status,\" no bureaucratic capital, no secret service atrocities, no people starving to death, no beggars, no prostitutes. Do the people of the Northeast and the people of Changchun necessarily not allow these \"treasures\" of a one-party dictatorship \"country,\" necessarily not allow themselves to be liberated, otherwise they are not considered \"part of the country\"?\n    The most shameless part of the Ta Kung Pao editorial is that it actually wrote this passage: \"The attacking tactics often use unarmed civilians as vanguards, with machine guns and mortars behind them to supervise the battle. The unarmed vanguards fall in piles, and only after exhausting the enemy's firepower do they officially engage in combat. May I ask what kind of tactics these are? Extremely cruel, extremely shameful.\" Good, we also ask the Ta Kung Pao editorial writers, are these words responsible, or are they just farting for the sake of farting? You say \"attacking tactics,\" insinuatingly referring, of course, to the tactics of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army in attacking Changchun. How do you know that the Northeast Democratic Allied Army uses such tactics? To put it bluntly, apart from the secret service agencies that specialize in spreading rumors and opposing the Communist Party and the people, apart from copying from newspapers run by Kuomintang \"experienced special operations comrades,\" one cannot find such tactics anywhere else in the world. In order to slander the Northeast People's Democratic Allied Army, Ta Kung Pao does not hesitate to write such words, lowering itself to the status of a secret service newspaper. In your opposition to the people, you have truly gone all out, truly \"extremely cruel, extremely shameful\"!\n    Why did Ta Kung Pao suddenly publish such an editorial? Everyone remembers that when the Kuomintang fascist group instigated reactionary anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, and anti-people demonstrations in February, vandalizing the New China Daily and the Democratic Daily, it was this \"public\" Ta Kung Pao that first launched a large-scale anti-Soviet campaign in its editorials, acting as the vanguard of the most brutal and shameless secret service atrocities of the fascists. Afterwards, many young students who were deceived by this reactionary newspaper realized the trick and shouted, \"We were fooled by Ta Kung Pao!\" Ta Kung Pao has young people inside, but its editorial writers are originally such powerful accomplices of the fascists, pretending to be liberal in normal times, and coming out to serve as much as possible when it comes to a critical juncture, when the fascists want to take action. Not only do they serve, but they also act as pathfinders for the fascists, as tigers for the man-eating tigers, and as dogs for the executioners, in order to get some favor from the fascists and executioners, lick the leftover blood, and chew on the leftover bones. The Ta Kung Pao editorial writers have exposed their true colors more than once. This time, the Ta Kung Pao editorial writers have once again exposed their true colors, and the people must be seriously vigilant!\n\n**Named Entities**\n\nOrganizations:\n\n大公报  Ta Kung Pao\n新华日报  New China Daily\n中国共产党   Chinese Communist Party\n国民党  Kuomintang\n东北民主联军  Northeast Democratic Allied Army\n政治协商会议  Political Consultative Conference\n\nPeople:\n\n马歇尔  Marshall\n\nPlaces:\n\n重庆  Chongqing\n上海  Shanghai\n长春  Changchun\n东北  Northeast\n营口  Yingkou\n建昌  Jianchang\n阜新  Fuxin\n盘山  Panshan\n辽中  Liaozhong\n台安  Tai'an\n抚顺  Fushun\n辽阳  Liaoyang\n铁岭  Tieling\n海城  Haicheng\n鞍山  Anshan\n大石桥  Dashiqiao\n开原  Kaiyuan\n法库  Faku\n昌图  Changtu\n本溪湖  Benxihu\n盖平  Gaiping\n四平街  Sipingjie\n汉口  Hankou\n广州  Guangzhou\n欧洲  Europe\n解放区  Liberated Areas\n云南  Yunnan\n\nEvents:\n\n长春之战  Battle of Changchun\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 可耻的大公报社论——重庆新华日报四月十八日社论\n\n1946-05-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　可耻的大公报社论\n    ——重庆新华日报四月十八日社论\n    重庆和上海的大公报，前昨两天登载了题目叫作《可耻的长春之战》的社论，这是大公报一篇可耻的社论，我们读了，实为大公报惜。\n    这篇社论，承认东北问题有内政问题，承认东北的内战令人伤心，承认停战令和政治协商会议决议没有实行。但是谁不承认东北问题有内政问题？谁破坏停战令和政治协商会议决议？中国人民，中外人士，都知道这就是由于马歇尔将军所说的国民党“顽固分子”作祟。大公报不但不敢说出这种浅显的真理，反而借长春战争为题，含沙射影，归罪于中共和中国人民，这样来替顽固派开脱罪名，并替顽固派帮凶，真是可耻极了！\n    国民党反动派发动内战，至少也有七个月了，在东北进行内战，至少也有五个月了，拿了美国的枪炮，屠杀自己的同胞。今年一月以来，攻营口、攻建昌、攻阜新，攻盘山，攻辽中、攻台安、攻抚顺、攻辽阳、攻铁岭、攻海城、攻鞍山、攻大石桥、攻开原、攻法库、攻昌图、攻本溪湖、攻盖平、攻四平街，攻了那么多地方，破坏了一月十三日与三月二十七日两次停战协议，却一直没有听见大公报对这些罪行说过一句“可耻”，到现在“长春之战”，大公报忽然说这一战是“可耻”的了。对于大公报的社论作者，凡是国民党法西斯反动派打击人民、残害人民、撕毁诺言、发动内战等事情，那怕天大的事，都是不“可耻”的，只有人民对于这种反动派还一还手，那就不得了，那就是“可耻”的了。大公报社论作者如此反对人民，应该是够“可耻”的了吧。\n    大公报社论作者说：“东北是国家的”。很好，请问你说的是什么国家，是国民党一党专政的国家么？还是中国人民的民主国家？在前一种国家之下，接收人员“五子登科”，官僚资本大发横财，特务暴行层出不穷，那里发生所谓“胜利灾”，饥民数目超过欧洲三倍，民族工业关门大吉，人民啃着树皮草根。汉口十个妇女中有一个妓女，广州人肉市场便宜到只值十枝香烟。“东北是国家的”，东北难道是这种“国家”的么？全国人民受尽了这种“国家”之苦，难道东北人民受了十四年亡国惨痛以后，还应该服服贴贴来受这种“国家”之苦么？中国可以有个好国家，其雏型已见于各解放区，如果政协决议实现，全国就可以慢慢照此雏型建立一个民主的新国家，真正人民有主权的国家。不说别的，解放区里至少至少没有“五子登科”的“接收大员”，没有官僚资本，没有特务暴行，没有饿死的人，没有乞丐，没有妓女。难道东北人民和长春人民一定不许没有这几件一党专政的“国家”的“宝贝”，一定不许得到自己的解放，否则就算不“是国家的”了么？\n    大公报社论最无耻的，就是居然的写出这样一段：“进攻战术，常是用徒手的老百姓打先锋，以机枪迫击炮在后面督战。徒手的先锋队成堆成堆的倒了，消耗了对方火力以后，才正式作战，请问这是什么战术，残忍到极点，可耻到极点”。好的，我们也请问大公报社论作者，这几句话是负责任的话，还是只当放屁放一放的呢？你说“进攻的战术”，含沙射影，当然指的是东北民主联军进攻长春的战术而言。你从什么地方知道东北民主联军用这样的战术？拆穿了说，除了从专门造谣反共反人民的特务机关那里以外，除了从国民党“素有经验的特工同志”办的报上抄来以外，世界上找不出这样战术。大公报为要污蔑东北人民的民主联军，不惜写出这种话来，把自己降低到一个特务报纸的地位，你在反人民这一点上，真是做到家了，真正“残忍到极点，可耻到极点”！\n    大公报为什么忽然登出这样社论来？大家记得，当二月里国民党法西斯集团策动反苏反共反人民的反动游行、捣毁新华日报和民主报的时候，就是这个“大公”的大公报，首先在社论上大肆反苏，做法西斯进行最残暴无耻的特务暴行之先锋。事后，许多被这个反动的报纸骗了的青年学生，才觉悟其中的鬼把戏，大呼“上了大公报的当”！大公报里是青年人的，但它的社论作者，原来是这样一个法西斯的有力帮凶，在平时假装自由主义，一到紧要关头，一到法西斯要有所行动时，就出来尽力效劳。不但效劳，而且替法西斯当开路先锋，替吃人的老虎当虎伥，替刽子手当走狗，以便从法西斯和郐子手那里讨得一点恩惠，舐一点喝剩的血，嚼一点吃剩的骨头。大公报社论作者暴露其原形，不止一次。这一次大公报社论作者又把自己的原形暴露出来了，人民必须严重警惕！"

    "content": "Taihang Strives for Self-Sufficiency in Clothing\n    Cotton Planting Exceeds 1.5 Million Mu\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu General Branch, Changzhi News] After a region-wide cotton planting campaign, Taihang's cotton planting achievements this year have surpassed any previous year. Taihang Chief Executive Yuan called on the entire region to plant 1.5 million mu of cotton. According to incomplete statistics, this number has already been exceeded. In Licheng, Pingshun, and other places where there was no cotton planting habit, after profiting from textile production last winter, the masses have clearly understood that cotton planting is an important condition for achieving \"耕三余一 (gēng sān yú yī)\" [cultivate for three and have surplus for one], and clothing self-sufficiency. Therefore, they have planted a large amount of cotton this year. Licheng County's six districts planned to plant 30,000 mu of cotton, and the plan has now been exceeded. One district alone planted more than 10,000 mu. Langzhuang Village, which profited the most from cotton planting last year, has converted 56% of its autumn land into cotton fields this year. Sun Yunjin, a 60-year-old man from Zizhen Village, planted one mu of cotton last year, and the harvest was equivalent to six mu of grain. This year, he planted ten mu on his own. After the Fourth District of Pingshun held a cotton field promotion training class, the number of cotton planting households quickly increased from two to 3,432 households; the original plan for 2,000 mu of cotton fields actually increased to more than 4,600 mu. The Niu Deng agricultural cooperative in X Village plans that each household plants more than one mu of cotton. Based on last year's minimum yield of 30 jin of raw cotton per mu, they can cover their own clothing needs and have a surplus. Liu Caibang, a labor hero from Jingdian Village in She County, led the entire village in carrying water to plant 800 mu of cotton last year despite the drought, gaining fame throughout Taihang. This year, he has led the entire village to plant more than 1,900 mu of cotton, and is still rushing to plant. Xihuangzhang Village in Zuoquan has specifically designated a cotton planting area, and the cotton fields have exceeded six times last year's acreage. The first district of Linbei planted 3,000 mu, and Zhao Village planted an average of one mu per person. In the vast newly liberated cotton-producing areas, such as northern Henan and western Hebei, especially in Wu'an and other places, cotton fields accounted for nearly 70% of all cultivated land before the war. However, in the past eight years, under the destruction of the enemy and puppets, the cotton fields have been greatly reduced. In the first year after liberation, the democratic government actively led cotton planting and issued huge amounts of loans. The Third Special Administrative Office also promulgated measures to encourage cotton planting: for cotton fields with a general grain burden of less than 16 jin of raw cotton per mu, the burden is waived, and cotton can be used instead of grain to pay the burden, with the price of cotton being 6% higher than the market price. If the cotton cannot be sold, the government will purchase it at the market price; if the cotton yield per mu is lower than the value of grain, the government will be responsible for compensating its losses. With such incentives from the government, the masses in cotton-producing areas are enthusiastic about planting cotton. In Wu'an alone, 57,000 mu have been planted, and the rest of northern Henan and western Hebei are still rushing to plant.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 10th] According to incomplete statistics: In more than 20 counties in Jin-Sui, more than 450,000 mu of cotton fields have been fully planted, doubling the amount from last year. In the newly liberated counties of Wenshui, Fenyang, Zhongyang, Xiaoyi, and Pingyao, the democratic government adjusted cotton fields and cotton seeds, resulting in a sudden increase from 30,000 mu of cotton fields under enemy occupation to 130,000 mu. In the old cotton planting areas of Lin County and other places in the Third Sub-district, the original plan was to plant a total of 100,000 mu of cotton, but Lin County alone has planted 110,000 mu. Originally, only Lishi, Linnan, and Xing County in Jin-Sui planted 30,000 mu of cotton. In 1944, Lin County, Hequ, Baode, and other counties were added, with a total of 150,000 mu of cotton planted. Last year, 13 counties including Lan County, Kelan, Fangshan, Jingning, Xinzhou, Jingle, Yangqu, Jiaocheng, Qingyuan, and Taiyuan were added, and the entire region had more than 218,000 mu of cotton fields.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    China\n晋冀鲁豫总分社  Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Zongfen She (Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu General Branch)\n太行  Taihang\n黎城  Licheng\n平顺  Pingshun\n郎庄村  Langzhuang Cun (Langzhuang Village)\n子镇村  Zizhen Cun (Zizhen Village)\n孙云锦  Sun Yunjin\n涉县  She County\n井店村  Jingdian Cun (Jingdian Village)\n刘才榜  Liu Caibang\n左权  Zuoquan\n西黄漳村  Xihuangzhang Cun (Xihuangzhang Village)\n林北  Linbei\n赵家村  Zhao Jia Cun (Zhao Jia Village)\n豫北  Yu Bei (Northern Henan)\n冀西  Ji Xi (Western Hebei)\n武安  Wu'an\n三专署  Third Special Administrative Office\n晋绥  Jin-Sui\n文水  Wenshui\n汾阳  Fenyang\n中阳  Zhongyang\n孝义  Xiaoyi\n平遥  Pingyao\n三分区  Third Sub-district\n临县  Lin County\n离石  Lishi\n临南  Linnan\n兴县  Xing County\n河曲  Hequ\n保德  Baode\n岚县  Lan County\n岢岚  Kelan\n方山  Fangshan\n静宁  Jingning\n忻县  Xinzhou\n静乐  Jingle\n阳曲  Yangqu\n交城  Jiaocheng\n清源  Qingyuan\n太原  Taiyuan\n耕三余一  gēng sān yú yī (cultivate for three and have surplus for one)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行争取穿衣自给  种棉超过百五十万亩\n\n1946-05-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行争取穿衣自给\n    种棉超过百五十万亩\n    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社长治讯】经过全区普遍植棉运动，太行今年植棉成绩，超过以往任何一年。太行行长原号召全区种棉一百五十万亩，现在据不完全统计，业已超过此数。向无种棉习惯的黎城、平顺等地，经过去年冬季纺织获利后，群众思想上已明确种棉是实现耕三余一、穿衣自给的重要条件，因之今年都大量植棉，黎城全县六个区计划种棉三万亩，现已超过计划。仅一区即种一万余亩。去年植棉获利最大的郎庄村，今年全村秋地百分之五十六成为棉田。子镇村六十岁老人孙云锦，去年种棉一亩，收成顶六亩谷，今年一人种了十亩。平顺四区召开了推广棉田训练班后，植棉户由两户迅速增到三千四百三十余户；原定棉田两千亩结果增植到四千六百余亩。×村牛等则组每户平均种一亩多花，按去年最低产量，每亩卅斤净花计算，可以顾住自己用穿还有余。涉县井店村劳动英雄刘才榜，去年天旱领导全村担水栽棉八百亩，名传太行；今年领导全村种棉已达一千九百余亩，现在还在抢种。左权西黄漳村特辟植棉区，棉田超过去年六倍。林北一区种了三千亩，赵家村每人平均种一亩。广大新解放的产棉区，如豫北、冀西，特别是武安等地，战前棉田几占全部耕田百分之七十，但八年来在敌伪摧残下棉田大为缩小。解放后的第一年，民主政府积极领导植棉，并发放巨量贷款，三专署并颁布奖励植棉办法：棉田一般应产粮负担每亩不足十六斤净花者，负担免交，并可以棉代粮，缴纳负担，花价高于市价百分之六。如棉花售不出者，政府按市价收买；如每亩棉产低于谷物值价时，政府负责赔偿其损失。产棉地区群众在政府如此奖励下，植棉情绪高涨，仅武（安）西一地，即下种五万七千亩，豫北冀西各地现仍在抢种中。\n    【新华社兴县十日电】据不完全统计：晋绥二十余县，已有四十五万亩棉田全部下种，比去年增加一倍。新解放区之文水、汾阳、中阳、孝义、平遥五县，由于民主政府调剂棉田棉籽，已由敌占时三万亩棉田突增至十三万亩。三分区之临县等地老植棉区，原计划共植棉十万亩，现仅临县就种棉十一万亩。按晋绥原只离石、临南、兴县三县植棉三万亩，四四年增加临县、河曲、保德等县，共种棉十五万亩。去年增加岚县、岢岚、方山、静宁、忻县、静乐、阳曲、交城、清源、太原等十三县，全区共有棉田二十一万八千余亩。"

It also points out several tasks that must be grasped before and after the summer harvest: 1. After the wheat heads sprout and bloom, stop applying top dressing and weeding, so as not to delay the maturity period. 2. Mobilize the masses to plant crops in the wheat furrows after the wheat heads sprout, striving to plant two crops even in areas where the wheat harvest is relatively late. 3. Remove and burn diseased plants. Select healthy wheat areas to prepare for large-scale seed selection. 4. Mobilize the masses to select seeds in the fields, and exchange seeds with healthy wheat areas. 5. Carry out an insect catching campaign before cutting the wheat, so that insects cannot transfer into the autumn vegetables. 6. Conduct harvest statistics and healthy ear/diseased ear percentage statistics based on key points. 7. Hold small-scale wheat ear competitions at base points to promote \"169\" wheat, and the selection methods for wheat seed retention areas.

According to a United Press report, regarding the Italian border issue, Britain and the United States expressed their agreement with France's border demarcation proposal (which would return most of the Julian March to Yugoslavia, but Trieste would still belong to Italy). The Soviet Union believes that this proposal constitutes an unreasonable artificial division of the Julian March from its economic center, and therefore refused to agree. No results have yet been achieved on the issue of reparations. Bevin also opposed Bidault's proposal for the four powers to control Italian colonies. Since there was no complete agreement on the peace treaty issue, Molotov rejected Bidault's suggestion to change the agenda and discuss Germany.

The brutal puppet army leader Xu Chunlin and his troops were routed, and order has been restored in Botou. It is reported that after the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Team arrived in Botou Town, they consulted with the Bohai Military Region and the Eighth Sub-district of Central Hebei. In order to resolutely implement the ceasefire order, the Eighth Route Army made concessions and signed an agreement with Xu Chunlin. The Eighth Route Army retreated three *li* from its original positions, and the existing fortifications were also demolished. However, the puppet troops in Botou instead built more fortifications and harassed the area daily, brutally killing dozens of local cadres of the democratic government, including Wu Yuquan, Wu Yuezhang, and Wang Fengyi. Recently, there was an incident of beating representatives of the Executive Headquarters and encircling and annihilating the Jiaohe security team. The Eighth Route Army in the area repeatedly lodged protests with the Kuomintang representatives, but they were ignored. Xu Chunlin even shot and killed most of the captured Eighth Route Army personnel and threw their bodies into the canal. The bodies recovered by local cadres included more than 60 people, including the Deputy Political Commissar of the Jiaohe Security Team. When the puppet troops launched a second attack on the Sanlizhuang Security Brigade, Communist representative Fu Jize and American representative Warner wanted to inspect the situation, but the puppet troops prevented them from leaving the city. When the two representatives walked along South Main Street, they were severely insulted by many puppet army hooligans, who threw clods of earth and bricks at Colonel Fu Jize. Lieutenant Colonel Warner was extremely angry and drew his pistol, saying, \"Whoever throws bricks again will be shot!\" The group of villains then fled in panic. That night, Lieutenant Colonel Warner telegraphed the Beiping Executive Headquarters, stating that the puppet troops in Botou Town had no sincerity in the negotiated agreement and that there were many complaints from the masses, demanding severe punishment. Warner angrily told the Communist Colonel Fu, \"Gather your forces and destroy them.\" At the same time, the Eighth Route Army received hundreds of petitions from the people accusing the traitors in Botou of their crimes and demanding the disbandment of the puppet army. The Eighth Route Army was compelled to act in self-defense. From May 3rd, fierce fighting broke out with the puppet troops, which ended on the 10th. In total, Botou Town and seven puppet army strongholds in its vicinity, including Fengjiakou, were liberated, more than 100 puppet troops were killed, and more than 1,000 puppet Dongguang security captains, including Li Wencheng, were captured.\n\n　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th] Today, this agency summarizes military news: (1) In Guangdong, the Kuomintang authorities violated the Guangdong Agreement of April 12th. Their three security regiments, commanded by Wei Zhanfu, Deputy Director of the Security Bureau, began attacking the Dongjiang area. (2) In the Su-Wan area, west of the Jinpu Railway in Huainan, the Kuomintang army under Xia Wei began to divide its forces and invade the Fourth Sub-district of Su-Wan on the 12th. Our army rose up in self-defense and is fiercely battling southwest and northwest of Dingyuan. (3) In Shandong, Wang Yaowu, Director of the Second Pacification Zone of the Kuomintang, held a secret military meeting in Xuzhou last month to deploy an attack on the Shandong Liberated Area. Currently, war has broken out in two locations, south of Jinan and near Zaozhuang. Over 3,000 troops from its 12th and 96th Armies began attacking the Licheng Liberated Area on the 11th and have occupied 24 villages and towns more than 30 *li* south of Jinan.

    "content": "With Government and Original Owner Working Together\n    Kejing Coal Mine Resumes Operations\n    Workers Concerned About 30% Increase in Mine Production\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu General Branch News] The historically significant Ji Yuan Kejing Coal Mine, after the Anti-Japanese War, suffered repeated destruction by the enemy, puppets, and diehards, as well as natural disasters, resulting in a four-year work stoppage. Now, through the joint efforts of our democratic government and Mr. Zhai Le'an, the original owner of the mine, production has resumed, with a daily output of 800 tons of coal. According to investigations, the mine area spans over thirty li from east to west and five to eight li from north to south. The coal seams are shallowest at one zhang and deepest at eight zhang, with a common depth of three zhang. Since the mine was recovered by our army last year, the old mine was badly damaged, and the machinery was incomplete. For the benefit of the people and to support the development of private enterprises, our democratic government consulted with Mr. Zhai Le'an, the original owner of the mine, in late November last year to discuss ways to resume work. The Economic Bureau also provided 20 million yuan in cash as a fund to support the mine. Technical workers were recruited at high prices from various places, and with the assistance of local masses, after a month and a half of repairing the tunnels and overhauling the machinery, work finally resumed in February of this year. Regarding labor-capital relations, the past system of high exploitation and abuse of workers by the capitalists has been improved. Now, under the leadership of our democratic government, everything is handled in a democratic manner. First, it was determined that workers have the responsibility to participate in the management of the factory and care for the mine, and at the same time, they also have the right to discuss various workers' wages and various systems. The capitalist has the obligation to solve various difficulties of the workers. The determination of wages and grain prices must be effective only after the workers' group or the general meeting agrees. Dismissal of workers must be approved by the trade union. Currently, the mine has a total of 1,214 workers, with mine workers accounting for 60%, machinists accounting for 10%, general workers accounting for 15%, foremen accounting for 10%, and staff accounting for 5%. The highest daily wage for workers is 200 yuan (equivalent to 1.6 dou of millet), the lowest is 60 yuan, and the average general wage is 140 yuan. In addition to their own expenses of 50 yuan per day, they can support five to seven people. In addition to salary, workers' families are also subsidized with coal for burning, ranging from 200 to 250 jin per person per month. If coal is not needed, it can be discounted at a price of three mao per jin. All of the above are proposed by the factory through democratic means and then determined after discussion by the workers. Due to the improvement of labor-capital relations and the increase in workers' living standards, workers are not only concerned about the future of the mine and the cost and sales of coal, but also vigilant about the sabotage of special agents and bad people. The production volume has increased by 30% compared to the past. They also voluntarily proposed to reduce the distribution of half an ounce of oil per person per day, saving the entire mine 35 jin of oil per day. The mine originally produced 500 to 600 tons of coal per day, but now it has increased to more than 800 tons (more than 1.1 million jin). In order to encourage workers to actively produce, the factory stipulated reward measures: those who produce one more cage of coal per day will be awarded 40 yuan, those who produce more than ten cages will be awarded 50 yuan per cage, and those who produce more than twenty cages will be awarded 60 yuan per cage. Therefore, all the mine workers have launched a production competition, and each can produce about fifteen to twenty more cages per day.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n中国    China\n晋冀鲁豫总分社  Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu General Branch\n济源    Jiyuan\n磕井煤矿  Kejing Coal Mine\n翟乐安  Zhai Le'an\n经济局  Economic Bureau\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 政府与原主协力下  磕井煤矿复业  工人关心矿窑增产百分之卅\n\n1946-05-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　政府与原主协力下\n    磕井煤矿复业\n    工人关心矿窑增产百分之卅\n    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社讯】富有历史意义的济源磕井煤矿，抗战后，经敌伪顽的一再破坏与灾荒，停工已达四年之久，现经我民主政府与该矿原主翟乐安先生之共同努力，已恢复生产，日产煤八百吨。据调查该矿区面积东西长三十余里，南北宽五里至八里，煤层最浅一丈，深者八丈，普通为三丈。该窑自去年被我军收复时，旧窑破坏不堪，机器残缺，我民主政府为了人民的利益，与扶助发展私人的企业，便于去年十一月下旬与该矿原主翟乐安先生商筹复工办法，经济局并以二千万元现金作为扶植该窑基金，在各处以高价招来技术工人，又加当地群众的协助，经一个半月的时间，修洞整理机器终于在今年二月开始复工。在劳资关系上，改善了过去资方高度剥削工人及打骂制度。现在我民主政府领导下，一切皆以民主方式处理，首先确定了工人有参加管理工厂与爱护矿场的责任，同时也有讨论各种工人工资与各种制度的权利，资方有解决工人各种困难的义务，确定工资与粮价时，必经工人小组或大会同意始能有效，开除工人须经工会同意。现该窑计有工人一千二百十四名，窑工占百分之六十，机工占百分之十，杂工占百分之十五，工头占百分之十，职员占百分之五。工人每日工资最高为二百元（合小米一斗六升），最低六十元，平均一般工资一百四十元。每天除自己费用五十元外，能养活五口至七口，除薪金外，还津贴工人家庭烧煤，每月每人二百斤至二百五十斤。如不要煤可按每斤三毛折价。以上都由民主方式经厂方提出再经工人讨论确定。由于劳资关系的改善，工人生活的提高，工人们不但关心矿窑的前途与煤的成本和销路，同时也警惕特务坏人的破坏，生产量较过去增加百分之三十。他们还自动提出每天每人减发半两油，全窑每天可省油卅五斤，该窑原每日计产煤五百至六百吨，现已提高至八百余吨（一百一十余万斤）。厂方为鼓励工人积极生产，规定奖励办法：每日多出煤一笼者，即奖洋四十元，多出十笼以上者，每笼奖五十元，二十笼以上者每笼奖六十元。因此各窑工人都展开了生产竞赛，每日均能多出十五至二十笼左右。"

It was discovered that cadres had a tendency to abandon leadership, mainly because some village cadres mistakenly believed that bold delegation meant no leadership, resulting in laissez-faire. For example, there was a theory that the county cannot manage the district, the district cannot manage the village, and the village cannot manage the people. The chairman of the Yuanzhuang Farmers' Association, when the masses were struggling, did not care about it, and said that this was letting go to mobilize the masses. After this meeting, the problem was clarified. Letting go to mobilize the masses does not mean that leadership is not needed, but that leadership must be strengthened, closely united with the masses, and the leadership role must be boldly brought into play. As the cadres of Zhoucun said: \"Leaders are like carters. Walking behind the car and not understanding the situation in front will lead to the ditch; walking in front, fearing that you will not get on the right path, the carter must walk with the car, closely adjacent to the car, and see the front, back, left, and right to go straight.\" Finally, it was unanimously agreed that the targets of struggle should be divided into large and small, important and unimportant, discussed and decided by the masses, and cadres should not be separated from the masses.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 14th] The Third Sub-district sent a work team of more than 200 people to the newly liberated areas of Lishi and other places to assist in carrying out rent reduction work. Every time they arrive in a village, they participate in mass production, and discover problems from being with the masses, publicize policies and laws to activists, and unite the masses through them, minimizing meetings to avoid delaying mass production. After 20 days of hard work, the mass movement has been further developed. According to statistics from Tianjiahui and other villages, 61 landlords have legally returned rent, and 56 tenants have benefited from the rent return. In the anti-corruption struggle, 34 shi of embezzled grain and 360,000 yuan of embezzled money were cleared. After the work team was stationed in the villages, the work in many surrounding villages also started. This kind of work team, assisting local cadres to break through the center and carry out work, is an effective method in the newly liberated areas. In order to avoid the problem of \"the work collapses when people leave,\" they also help to transform the village government and farmers' association organizations, cleanse bad elements, promote active and outstanding elements, establish a leadership core, and lay the foundation for future work.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    China\n晋城    Jincheng\n阳城    Yangcheng\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n元庄    Yuanzhuang\n周村    Zhoucun\n兴县    Xingxian\n三分区  Third Sub-district\n离石    Lishi\n田家会  Tianjiahui\n晋绥派   Jin-Sui pai\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋城检讨群运领导经验  放手不等于自流领导如同“赶车”  晋绥派工作团协助新区群运\n\n1946-05-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋城检讨群运领导经验\n    放手不等于自流领导如同“赶车”\n    晋绥派工作团协助新区群运\n    【新华社阳城十五日电】晋城六区，于日前召开区村干部会议，检讨群众运动，发现干部中有放弃领导的偏向，主要的是有些村干部误认大胆放手为不要领导，形成放任自流。如有这样一种理论，说县不能管区，区不能管村，村不能管老百姓。元庄农会主席，当群众斗争时，自己不管，并说这是放手发动群众。经过这次会议，把这问题弄明白了，放手发动群众不是不要领导，而是更要加强领导，紧紧和群众在一块，大胆发挥领导作用，正如周村的干部所说：“领导人员和赶车人一样，走在车后不了解前边情况，会赶到沟里；走在前面，怕走不上正路，赶车人要与车走在一起，紧紧挨着车，前后左右要看到才能走直路”。最后又一致认为，斗争对象要分出大小轻重，由群众讨论群众决定，干部不能脱离群众干。\n    【新华社兴县十四日电】三分区派出二百余人组成之工作团，赴离石等地新解放区协助开展减租工作。他们每到一村，就参加群众生产，和群众在一起从中发现问题，向积极分子宣传政策法令，通过他们去团结群众，尽量少开会，以免耽误群众生产，这样经过二十天的努力，群众运动已进一步开展。据田家会等村的统计，已有六十一个地主依法退租，五十六个佃户获得退租利益。在反贪污斗争中清算出贪污粮三十四石，贪污款三十六万余元。工作团驻过的村庄，工作开展后，周围许多村庄的工作也随之开展起来。此种工作团，协助地方干部突破中心，开展工作，在新解放区是有效的办法。为了避免发生“人走工作垮”的毛病，还帮助改造村政权与农会组织，清洗不良分子，提拔积极优秀分子，建立领导核心，打下今后工作的基础。"

The broad masses of poor people are vying to buy land after rent reduction. In Xigou Village, Pianguan, over twenty families bought two hundred and forty mu of good land. Rich peasants in various areas have increased the employment of over one hundred and seventy long-term laborers. Over ten landlords in Hequ, such as Zhang Chengye and Yu Hongjue, have actively turned to agriculture and industry to develop production after rent reduction. The six counties of Hequ, Baode, Pianguan, Shenchi, Wuzhai, and Kelan have collectively purchased over two thousand head of livestock, and the masses are paying more attention to fertilizing cultivated land. In Hequ Chengguan, two hundred and twenty-eight households collected over twenty thousand cartloads of manure in half a month. In Wuhuacheng Village, the amount of oil cakes purchased for fertilizing fields increased from thirty thousand jin last year to eighty thousand jin this year. The price of each small cart of manure has risen from thirty yuan to one hundred and twenty yuan. The masses' enthusiasm for production this year is higher than in previous years. In the past half month, activities such as planting cotton, weaving textiles, repairing water conservancy facilities, and engaging in transportation have been more enthusiastic than in previous years.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 11th] In areas where rent reduction and rent investigation are continuing in depth during the spring plowing, the masses are enthusiastically engaging in large-scale production. In villages such as Huangshuihe and Anzishang in Guoxian County, the masses redeemed over two hundred and fifty mu of land and distributed over a hundred mu of temple land. After more than forty poor peasant households received food rations, they immediately joined nearby villages such as Beiwuzhuang to flood over ten thousand mu of land and repair a canal that can irrigate three thousand mu of land. In the third district of Fangshan, after rent investigation and protection of tenancy, according to statistics from three villages, one thousand mu of wasteland have already been reclaimed. In Huajiapo Village, fourteen hired laborers used increased funds to buy cattle and organized two labor exchange groups to take turns going up the mountain to reclaim wasteland. Zhang Chuyuan, the creator of combining labor and armed forces to protect production in Ningwu County, started the rent investigation movement in Shibeibao by first solving the food and seed difficulties of poor peasants. At the same time, he organized labor exchange teams and reformed twelve hooligans to participate in production. In Wenshui, after breaking the cadres' idea that \"there is no rent to reduce in the plains,\" the rent reduction movement in central villages such as Xiahuizhen, Shuizhai Village, and Beixindian has been launched. Yongle Village expanded its cultivated land by one hundred and sixty mu, and cotton planting increased several times compared to last year. In Renyan Village, Fenyang, ninety laborers organized labor exchanges after rent reduction, and women also organized labor exchange groups to plant cotton and develop household textiles. After the victory of rent reduction and wage increase in Fengzhen, labor exchange teams have been organized in over eighty villages. After the first district of Yubaigou won the struggle against the local tyrant Ni Shuanggui, over two hundred laborers and forty head of livestock in the entire village participated in the labor exchange team. In Lixun Village, after rent reduction, landlords and tenants jointly built canals. After rent reduction in Gongyong Village, Xingning, the area of cultivated land was expanded by over one thousand one hundred mu this year, and many hired laborers were able to obtain land and become independent farmers.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n地方\tPlaces:\n\n晋绥\tJin Sui\n兴县\tXing County\n偏关\tPianguan\n西沟村\tXigou Village\n河曲\tHequ\n保德\tBaode\n神池\tShenchi\n五寨\tWuzhai\n岢岚\tKelan\n崞县\tGuoxian County\n黄水河\tHuangshuihe\n安子上\tAnzishang\n北午庄\tBeiwuzhuang\n方山\tFangshan\n花家坡村\tHuajiapo Village\n宁武县\tNingwu County\n食北堡\tShibeibao\n文水\tWenshui\n下会镇\tXiahuizhen\n水寨村\tShuizhai Village\n北辛店\tBeixindian\n永乐村\tYongle Village\n汾阳\tFenyang\n仁岩村\tRenyan Village\n丰镇\tFengzhen\n榆柏沟\tYubaigou\n立峋村\tLixun Village\n兴宁\tXingning\n弓涌村\tGongyong Village\n\n人物\tPeople:\n\n张承业\tZhang Chengye\n于洪爵\tYu Hongjue\n张初元\tZhang Chuyuan\n倪拴桂\tNi Shuanggui\n\n组织\tOrganizations:\n\n新华社\tXinhua News Agency\n\n事件\tEvents:\n\n减租\tRent Reduction\n查租\tRent Investigation\n保佃\tProtection of Tenancy\n拨工队\tLabor exchange teams\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋绥减租后  广大群众置地生产  二分区富农增雇长工百余人\n\n1946-05-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋绥减租后\n    广大群众置地生产\n    二分区富农增雇长工百余人\n    【新华社兴县十四日电】晋绥二分区各地，各阶层生产情绪普遍高涨，广大贫苦群众，在减租后争相买地。偏关西沟村有二十余家，即买进好地二百四十余亩，各地富农增雇长工一百七十余人。河曲地主张承业，于洪爵等十余人，在减租后，积极转向农工业，发展生产。河曲、保德、偏关、神池、五寨、岢岚六县，共增购牲口达二千余头，群众对耕地施肥，更加注意。河曲城关二百二十八户，在半月内就集粪二万余车。五花城村，去年买油饼三万斤肥田，今年就增加到八万斤，每小车粪价由三十元涨至一百二十元，群众今年生产情绪，较往年提高。半月来种棉纺织、修水利、闹运输，均较往年热烈。\n    【新华社兴县十一日电】在春耕中继续深入减租查租的地区，群众都热情地搞大生产。崞县黄水河、安子上等村。群众赎回土地二百五十余亩，分得庙地百余亩，四十余户贫农得到口粮后，即联合附近北午庄等村，漫地万余亩，修复水渠一条，可灌地三千余亩。方山三区经过查租保佃后，据三个村统计，即已开荒千亩。花家坡村十四个雇农，用增资买牛，组织两个变工组，轮流上山垦荒。宁武县劳力与武力结合，保卫生产的创造者张初元，在食北堡先从解决贫苦农民食粮种了困难入手，开展了该村的查租运动，同时组织变工队，并改造十二个二流子参加生产。文水打破了干部认为“平川无租可减”的思想后，下会镇、水寨村、北辛店等中心村庄的减租运动，已发动起来，永乐村扩大耕地一百六十亩，植棉比去年增加数倍。汾阳仁岩村，九十个劳动力，在减租后组织变工，妇女也组织变工组，种棉花发展家庭纺织。丰镇减租增资胜利后。已组织了八十余村拨工队，一区榆柏沟斗争恶霸倪拴桂胜利后，全村二百多个劳动力和四十余头牲口参加拨工队。立峋村减租后，主佃合伙修筑水渠。兴宁弓涌村经减租后，今年扩大耕地面积一千一百余亩，不少雇工，因而得到土地而自立庄户。"

Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Region Government attended and spoke, mainly elaborating on industrial and commercial policies, particularly encouraging the operation of industries such as leather, matches, cement, iron, pigments, soap, textiles, oil pressing, and paper making. In addition to a one-third reduction in business tax, loan assistance may also be provided. Increase wages, treat technical personnel preferentially, and at the same time take care of factory profits, ensuring that capitalists' profits are greater than in the Kuomintang areas. Publicly owned factories and stores, except for those of a supply nature, shall not enjoy any privileges. Subsequently, Mayor Wang spoke, explaining the government's policy of developing commercial capital. He said: For stores with enemy and puppet funds, only the enemy and puppet portion will be taken over as government or mass shares for continued operation, and will not be withdrawn. Y茂祥皮货店(Yu Mao Xiang Leather Goods Store) had a batch of goods from the enemy, and after voluntarily reporting it, the municipal government handled it according to the above-mentioned method. He also said: Merchants who fled before and after liberation due to enemy and puppet deception and propaganda are welcome to return to their hometowns to do business. During the meeting, the merchants from various industries nodded frequently, very satisfied, after hearing the government's commercial policies. Finally, in order to implement industrial and commercial policies and strengthen merchant work, the meeting decided to expand and reorganize the Chamber of Commerce into the Federation of Industry and Commerce.

It is understood that the mission of this group is to organize a relief committee and restore transportation within the city, allowing people to move freely and conduct trade. Currently, the puppet troops garrisoning Yongnian City are actively building fortifications in preparation for war. The main reason why relief efforts in Yongnian City have not been smooth in recent months is due to the obstruction by the puppet troops.

Upon hearing the grievous news, the military and civilians of the East China Liberated Area were overcome with grief and indignation. The 7th Division of the New Fourth Army held a memorial meeting in its garrison on the 1st of this month, with everyone vowing to avenge the deceased. Director Lü was a native of Wuwei, Anhui. He was 45 years old during the War of Resistance, a graduate of Peking University, and a well-known figure in the local education community. After the War of Resistance, he participated in the administrative work of the county, mobilizing the people to resist Japan, which was not tolerated by the authorities. In 1940, he resolutely went to work in the Liberated Area, serving successively as the county head of Yizheng in Huaibei, the principal of the Joint Middle School, and the county head of Wuwei and Director of the Administrative Office in Central Anhui. He devoted himself to public service for six years and was deeply loved by the masses. In 1942, he joined the Communist Party of China. In 1943, he personally supervised the construction of the Huai River dike on the north bank of the Yangtze River, completing a massive project that the Kuomintang government had failed to complete in the past twenty years. The people of the seven surrounding counties were forever freed from the scourge of floods. It was unanimously agreed to name the dike the \"Huisheng Dike\" to commemorate his contributions. Last June, when Director Lü withdrew north with the 7th Division of the New Fourth Army, he was suddenly attacked and arrested on the Yangtze River waterway by the 1st Regiment of the Anhui Provincial Security Corps of the Kuomintang (this unit was originally under the command of the traitor Hu Zhengkang, the former puppet county head of Wuwei). The Kuomintang fascist faction first used high positions and handsome salaries to shamelessly lure him, and then resorted to beatings and coercion, but Director Lü remained unyielding. In November, Hu sent Director Lü to Nanjing, where the Kuomintang authorities ordered his execution. Comrade Wang Huichuan, a staff officer of the Independent Brigade of the New Fourth Army, was also killed at the same time.\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n中国    China\n南京  Nanjing\n临沂  Linyi\n皖江解放区  Wanjiang Liberated Area\n华东解放区  East China Liberated Area\n安徽  Anhui\n淮南  Huainan\n仪征  Yizheng\n皖中  Central Anhui\n无为  Wuwei\n江宁镇  Jiangningzhen\n长江    Yangtze River\n淮河  Huai River\n\n吕惠生  Lü Huisheng\n王惠川  Wang Huichuan\n胡正刚  Hu Zhengkang\n\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n新四军  New Fourth Army\n中国共产党  Communist Party of China\n国民党  Kuomintang\n北平大学  Peking University\n安徽省保安一团  1st Regiment of the Anhui Provincial Security Corps\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 皖江行署主任吕惠生同志  惨遭南京当局杀害  华东军民悲愤万分誓为死者复仇\n\n1946-05-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　皖江行署主任吕惠生同志\n    惨遭南京当局杀害\n    华东军民悲愤万分誓为死者复仇\n    【新华社临沂十三日电】国民党法西斯派早于去年十一月，将皖江解放区行政公署主任吕惠生同志惨杀于南京江宁镇狱中之事件，已于最近证实，恶耗传来，华东解放区军民，莫不悲愤万分。新四军七师，特于本月一日，在驻地举行追悼大会，全体誓为死者复仇。吕主任为安徽无为人，抗战时年四十五岁，北平大学毕业，为当地教育界名流，抗战后参加本县行政工作，动员人民抗战，为当局所不容。四○年毅然至解放区工作，历任淮南仪征县长、联合中学校长及皖中无为县长，行政公署主任。六年奋力从公，备受群众爱戴，四二年参加中国共产党，四三年曾亲自监修长江北岸之淮河堤岸，完成国党当政二十年来所不能完成的巨大工程，附近七县民众，永脱水患；公议将该堤命名为惠生堤，以志不忘。去年六月吕主任随新四军七师北撤，在长江水路上突遭国民党安徽省保安一团（该部原系伪无为县长胡逆正刚所属）袭击被捕，国民党法西斯派，先以高官厚禄，无耻相诱，后又施以毒打威逼，但吕主任坚不屈服，十一月间，胡逆将吕主任解往南京，国民党当局受命杀害，同时被难者尚有新四军独立旅参谋王惠川同志。"

    "content": "Under Capitalist Imperialist Rule\n    Widespread Famine in Western Europe and Southeast Asia\n    Hamburg and Paris Eat Human Hair and Cat Meat; Malaysians Receive Only One and a Half Taels of Flour Per Day\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th] Comprehensive reports: Western European capitalist countries and Asian colonies such as China and those under foreign rule in Southeast Asia are facing severe famine. In Central Europe, the number of people starving to death in Italy, Greece, and Germany is increasing daily. Italians can only obtain one-third of their minimum food requirements. Recently, the Italian Minister of Food declared that the situation cannot be changed because the relief food has been delayed. The daily calorie intake per person in Greece has dropped to 600-700 calories, while the minimum daily requirement is 2,200 calories, and it is continuing to decrease. Unrest is increasing in western Germany, and British and American authorities have increased troop deployments. Hospitals in Hamburg are making food from human hair to feed patients, claiming that hair contains nutrients. Eating cats is common in French cities; in Paris alone, 10,000 cats have disappeared. Before Soviet aid, French people's daily rations had been reduced to four liang. According to people who have visited France, the French people are all yellow and emaciated due to insufficient food. In addition, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Spain, and Norway are also experiencing severe hunger. Food rations in Britain itself are also being reduced daily. In Asia, countless people have died of starvation in the Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Guizhou. According to a Central News Agency report on the 10th of this month, the number of famine victims has increased to 30 million. In India, more than 3.5 million people have starved to death. Malaya is still short of 60% of its food needs, and the current daily flour ration per person will be reduced from seven ounces to two ounces (equivalent to one and a half taels). Ceylon and the Philippines also urgently need food relief. Even Burma, known as a rice granary, is experiencing food shortages. It is said that if relief is not received by the end of June, more than 10 million people in Southeast Asia will die of starvation, and the famine will continue. The main reason for this famine is the poor economic systems of the above-mentioned countries. The Soviet News Agency recently published a report by its special correspondent visiting the American occupation zone in Germany, proving that the famine in western Germany was caused by landlords abandoning land and farmers' low production morale. In other places, such as India, bureaucratic habits, corruption of rulers, and speculation by merchants have exacerbated the famine. While war damage has indeed affected food production, the Soviet Union claims that under the Soviet system, although the war damage suffered by the Soviet Union was more severe than any other country, it is still able to produce enough food. The war damage in Eastern European countries and eastern Germany is also more severe than in Western Europe, but thanks to land reform, the people are also spared from starvation. Therefore, Soviet newspapers emphasize that the solution to hunger in various places lies in implementing land reform and ending imperialist rule.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\nPeople:\n\nFood Minister of Italy Itidaliliangshi buzhang\nUnnamed correspondant of the Soviet News Agency  Su lian xiaoxi bao wuming jizhe\n\nPlaces:\n\n延安  Yan'an\n西欧  Xi Ou\n东南亚  Dongnan Ya\n汉堡  Hanbao\n巴黎  Bali\n中欧洲  Zhong Ou\n意大利  Yidali\n希腊  Xila\n德国  Deguo\n英国  Yingguo\n美国  Meiguo\n法国  Faguo\n苏联  Su lian\n荷兰  Helan\n比利时  Bilishi\n卢森堡  Luxenbao\n奥地利  Aodili\n西班牙  Xibanya\n挪威  Nuowei\n两广  Liang Guang\n两湖  Liang Hu\n河南  Henan\n贵州  Guizhou\n印度  Yindu\n马来亚  Malaiya\n锡兰  Xilan\n菲岛  Feidao\n缅甸  Miandian\n东欧  Dong Ou\n\nOrganizations:\n\n新华社  Xinhua She\n中央社  Zhongyang She\n苏联消息报  Soviet News Agency\n\nEvents:\n\nNone\n\nSlogans:\n\nNone\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 资本帝国主义统治下  西欧东南亚普遍饥荒  汉堡巴黎以人发猫肉为食马来人日仅得面粉一两半\n\n1946-05-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　资本帝国主义统治下\n    西欧东南亚普遍饥荒\n    汉堡巴黎以人发猫肉为食马来人日仅得面粉一两半\n    【新华社延安十三日电】综合报导：西欧资本主义国家及亚洲的中国及在外国统治下的东南亚各殖民地，正陷严重的饥荒。中欧洲方面，意、希、德等国饿毙的人数，日益增加。意大利每人只能获得最低粮食的三分之一。最近意粮食部长宣称：由于救济的粮食延宕未至，情况无法改变。希腊每人每日所得粮食的热量，已降至六百至七百卡罗里，每日所需的热量，最少限度为二千二百卡罗里，而且正在继续减少中。德国西部骚动事件日益增加，英美当局已增兵戒备。汉堡医院将人发制成食品，给病人吃，据说头发中含有营养料，以猫为食的事件，在法国城内甚是普遍，仅巴黎一地，即有一万只猫失踪，在苏联援助以前，法人每日口粮已减至四两。据到法国考察的人说，法国人民都因食不足饱而面黄饥瘦。此外荷、比、卢、奥、西、挪等国，亦在严重的饥饿中。英国本国的粮食配给，亦在日益缩减。在亚洲方面：中国两广、两湖、河南、贵州等省的人民死于饥饿者，不可胜计。据中央社本月十日电称：饥民已增至三千万人，印度已有三百五十余万人民活活饿毙。马来亚尚缺粮食百分之六十，目前每日每人的麦粉配给，将由七盎斯减到二盎斯（即等于一两半）。锡兰、菲岛亦急需粮食救济，连素以米仓著称的缅甸，亦感粮食不足。据称：倘若在六月底以前得不到救济，东南亚将有千余万人死于饥饿，饥荒将继续延长下去。这次粮荒的主要原因，是上述各国的经济制度的不良。苏联消息报最近发表其特派记者访问德境美占领区的报导，证明由于地主的荒废土地，与农民生产情绪的低落，造成了德西部的饥馑。在其他地方，如印度，由于统治者的官僚习气贪污腐化，商人的囤积居奇，而使饥荒更加严重化。战争的破坏固影响粮食生产，然苏联方面宣称，在苏联制度下，虽然苏联所遭的战争破坏较任何其他国家为剧，而目前仍能生产足够的粮食。东欧诸国及德国东部的战争破坏，亦较西欧为剧，但由于土地改革的结果，人民亦免于饥饿。因而苏联报纸强调解决各地饥饿的办法，乃在于实行土地改革及结束帝国主义的统治。"

The government is now organizing the masses to actively capture the pests and has reported to the commissioner's office requesting loans to re-sow.

Therefore, they have been supported by the people of all countries, enabling the strength of the Communist Party to achieve rapid development. Now, in addition to the Soviet Union and China, there are already Communist parties in eighteen countries in the world leading or participating in governments, which guarantees that the world must develop towards the path of peace and democracy. The existing materials are described as follows:\n    1. The French Communist Party has six cabinet members, accounting for one-third of all cabinet members.

On this basis, a coalition government was formed.\n    6. In Norway, two members of the Norwegian Communist Party serve as cabinet ministers, and there are thirteen members of parliament (compared to none before the war), and 652 seats in municipal and township councils (compared to only 17 seats in 1937).\n    7. In Belgium, four members of the Belgian Communist Party joined the cabinet, and there are 24 members of parliament in the House of Representatives and 11 in the Senate (compared to only 9 in 1939), and 58 provincial councilors (compared to only 28 in 1936).\n    8. In Italy, the Italian Communist Party controls the Ministry of Justice, Agriculture, and Finance of the Cabinet. As of October last year, the party had reached 1.7 million members.\n    9. In Finland, the Finnish Communist Party holds the Ministry of Interior and other departments in the cabinet.

In Spain, at the beginning of April this year, one member of the Spanish Communist Party joined the Spanish Republican government, serving as a cabinet minister. There are currently 25,000 party members in Spain.\n    15.

Currently, the German Communist Party has grown from 350,000 members before the war to 670,000 members. Its allied Socialist Party has more than one million members.\n    16. In Vietnam, the leader of the Vietnamese Communist Party, Ho Chi Minh, established the Provisional Government of Vietnam in the summer of 1944. The People's Liberation Army under his leadership reached 500,000 people. After the Japanese surrender in August 1945, the People's Republic of Vietnam was officially established, and Ho Chi Minh continued to serve as President. In March of this year, France signed an agreement with it, allowing its legal government to have the status equivalent to a self-governing territory.\n    17.

Under the auspices of the democratic government, more than 2,000 households in the district were allocated 3,800 mu of enemy and puppet land. They were about to receive land deeds at this celebration, and they were as happy as if it were their birthday, wearing new clothes and performing stilts and Yangko dances. Gao Chongmin, Chairman of Andong Province, Liu Lanbo, Vice Chairman, and the Mayor of Andong City all extended warm congratulations to the peasants and used kind words to discuss with them what to do in the future. Waves of enthusiastic slogans resounded in the sky: \"Long live the Communist Party!\" \"Support the Democratic Government!\" \"Oppose the reactionaries' attack on the Northeast!\" After receiving the land deeds, thousands of peasants put them into strong pockets close to their bodies, and then formed a line, carrying a huge statue of Chairman Mao in a sedan chair, and paraded with cheers. The folk music was held in the front, and they said to the people: \"We have been poor for thousands of years. Now, with the help of Chairman Mao, we have been liberated. We must defend the land we have obtained!\" Since the liberation of Langtou District, it has become increasingly prosperous. With government loans, more than 40 cooperatives such as shipping, fishery, tobacco, and electricity have been organized. This distribution of land seized by the enemy and puppets was carried out according to the degree of poverty. The allocation committees of each street, composed of workers, peasants, women, military representatives, and street chiefs, conducted detailed surveys, measurements, and reviews in advance, and then convened mass meetings to study and discuss, and make fair decisions. Ordinary peasants and workers were allocated eight to twelve mu of land. At the end of the meeting, the reporter saw countless peasants carrying grain and farm tools from the meeting on their backs, closely following the sedan chair. Now, the allocation committees of Langtou District have been transformed into production committees, leading the development of a large-scale production movement.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    China\n安东市  Andong Shi (Andong City)\n浪头区  Langtou Qu (Langtou District)\n刘白羽  Liu Baiyu\n新华社  Xinhua She (New China News Agency)\n东北   Dongbei (Northeast China)\n高崇明  Gao Chongmin\n刘澜波  Liu Lanbo\n共产党  Gongchandang (Communist Party)\n毛主席  Mao Zhuxi (Chairman Mao)\n杨歌    Yangge\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 安东市浪头区  数千群众集会庆翻身  宣称：“我们要保卫已经得到的土地！”\n刘白羽\n1946-05-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　安东市浪头区\n    数千群众集会庆翻身\n    宣称：“我们要保卫已经得到的土地！”\n    【新华社东北十六日电】本社记者刘白羽报导：四月十八日早晨，安东市浪头区数千劳苦人民以无比喜悦，举行庆祝翻身大会。在民主政府主持之下，余区二千多户，分了三千八百亩敌伪土地，这次将在庆祝会上，领取地照，他们好像过生日一样，穿了新衣服，闹着高跷秧歌。安东省主席高崇明、副主席刘澜波及安东市长等，都向农民致热诚的祝贺，并用亲切的言辞，和他们商量今后要做的事，一阵阵热烈的口号，震响高空：“共产党万岁！”“拥护民主政府！”“反对反动派向东北进攻！”数千农民于领到地照后，把它放进贴身的牢固的口袋里，于是排成队伍，用花轿抬着毛主席的巨像，欢呼游行。前面举着民间音乐，他们对人们说：“我们穷了几千年，现在毛主席帮助下，我们翻身了，我们要保卫已经得到的土地！”浪头区被解放以后，日趋繁荣，经过政府贷款，组织起船运、渔业、烟草、电气等合作社四十余处。这次分配敌伪强占土地，是按照穷苦情况，事先由工、农、妇女、军事代表及街长组成的各街分配委员会进行详细的调查丈量审查后，再召开群众会议研究讨论，公平决定。普通农民和工人，都分到八亩至十二亩土地。在散会时，记者看见无数农民，背负着从会上领到的粮食农具，紧跟在花轿后面。现在浪头区各分配委员会，已转为生产委员会，领导开展大生产运动。"

The first item discussed by the council was the \"Regarding Zhang City's Current Policy Direction\" case proposed by the CPC Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee, which was unanimously passed after two days of discussion. The second case passed by the council concerned the issue of rent, which is of great importance to all residents of the city. A decision was made after several studies by a special committee and on-site investigations. To encourage private investment in real estate operations, the existence of \"second landlords\" (二房东) is permitted. The most heated debate revolved around the types and amounts of taxes, with the consensus being that the principles should be fairness, reasonableness, simplicity, and ease of implementation, while also considering the city's minimum necessary financial expenditures. The final resolution unanimously passed included: (1) Changing the business income tax to a unified progressive tax. (2) Exempting businesses with license fees, such as grain, fresh and dried fruits, and small-scale businesses, from business tax. (3) Implementing a license tax for small businesses, levied based on income levels, with exemptions for impoverished small businesses. The council also approved the municipal government's budget for the 34th year of the Republic. Elections were held on the 9th, with all ninety-one official councilors in attendance. Candidates were freely and unrestrictedly nominated by councilors through joint signatures. After introductions and campaigning, Liu Xiufeng was elected as the Chairman of the City Council with 75 votes, Yu Dehai with 70 votes, and Chen Zhaoren with 59 votes as Vice-Chairmen, and Yang Chunfu was elected as a government member. Communist Party members accounted for only three of these positions. Finally, Yang Chunfu was elected as the Mayor with 90 votes, and Zhang Mengxu was elected as the Deputy Mayor with 85 votes.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n人物  (People)\n刘秀峰  Liu Xiufeng\n于德海  Yu Dehai\n陈兆仁  Chen Zhaoren\n杨春甫  Yang Chunfu\n张孟旭  Zhang Mengxu\n\n地点 (Places)\n张家口市  Zhangjiakou Shi\n张市  Zhang Shi\n\n组织机构 (Organizations)\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n中共张家口市委  CPC Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee\n\n其他 (Other)\n二房东  Second Landlords\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 审查政府工作确定施政方针  张市举行首届参议会\n\n1946-05-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　审查政府工作确定施政方针\n    张市举行首届参议会\n    【新华社张家口十四日电】历时半月的张家口市首届参议会一次大会，于胜利完成十七万市民所咐托之确立市政大计及选举正副议长市政府委员后，十日已隆重闭幕。该会自本月二日起，即进行讨论提案，原提案共三百三十三件，经过分组综合，讨论与通过者，共十四大件。大会首项讨论者为中共张家口市委“关于张市目前施政方针”一案，经两天讨论后一致通过。大会通过之第二案为房租问题，这与全市居民关系极大，经专门委员会数次研究与实地调查始做出决定。为奖励私人投资经营房产，允许二房东存在。关于税收品类征额，争论最为热烈，共同认为其原则应为公平合理简单易行，并照顾本市最低限度之财政开支。最后一致通过之决议案为（１）将营业所得税改为统一累进税。（２）将有牙税之商业，如粮食干鲜果等及小本买卖业，免除营业税。（３）对小商实行照牌税，根据收入分等征收，贫苦小商则一律免征。大会并批准了市政府之三十四年度财政预算。九日进行选举，九十一位正式参议员全体出席，自由无拘束的由各议员联署提议候选人，经过介绍和竞选，结果刘秀峰以七十五票当选为市参议会议长，于德海以七十票、陈兆仁以五十九票当选为副议长，杨春甫当选为政府委员。其中共产党员只占三名。最后杨春甫以九十票当选为正义长，张孟旭以八十五票当选为副市长。"

Over 200,000 mu of salt fields are being used for salt production, and over 2,000 fishing boats are catching fish. It is estimated that this year's salt production will reach 200 million jin, and fish production in the Jiaodong area alone will reach at least 100 million jin. Yantai, Weihai, and Shidao are all well-known fishing centers in North China. Shidao is also one of the four major salt fields in the country. According to incomplete statistics, to date, the democratic government has loaned over 70 million yuan in local currency and provided over 100,000 jin of grain to help fishermen and salt workers. It has also purchased and sold large quantities of stored salt to stabilize salt prices. In Jiaodong and Bohai areas alone, approximately 60 million jin of salt have been purchased and sold. Furthermore, various exorbitant taxes and levies from the enemy and puppet regime period have been abolished. After denouncing traitors and expressing grievances, the production enthusiasm of fishermen and salt workers has greatly increased. For example, Tuo Wang salt fields (in Ganyu County) have increased from 2,000 mu to 10,000 mu, and production has increased from 200,000 dan to 1.2 million dan. Yangjiaogou has increased from 30 *fangtan* to 187 *fangtan*. South of Qikou, salt workers have built 20 large seawalls this spring, opening up 15,000 mu of new salt flats. The 20,000 mu of barren beaches in Jiaodong are being actively restored. This year's production is expected to increase by one-third compared to last year, and fisheries are expected to increase tenfold or more. Fishermen's and salt workers' cooperatives have been established in various places. There are 12 in the Bohai area and over 40 in the Jiaodong area. The larger-scale ones include the public-private joint venture Yantai Aquatic Products Company, which has capital of over 2.8 million yuan and a large cold storage facility with a freezing room capable of storing over 200 tons of aquatic products. Fishermen can entrust the company to sell on their behalf free of charge and not below the market price. As a result, the lives of fishermen and salt workers have greatly improved, and the sideline income of farmers has also increased. Binhai alone can produce 700 million jin of salt this year, and transportation can generate profits of 100 million yuan.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n山东  Shandong\n河北  Hebei\n祁口  Qikou\n江苏  Jiangsu\n连云港  Lianyungang\n临沂  Linyi\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n胶东  Jiaodong\n烟台  Yantai\n威海  Weihai\n石岛  Shidao\n华北  North China\n渤海  Bohai\n赣榆县  Ganyu County\n拓汪盐田  Tuo Wang salt fields\n羊角沟  Yangjiaogou\n滨海  Binhai\n方滩 *fangtan* (salt production unit)\n烟台水产公司  Yantai Aquatic Products Company\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 山东三千里海岸线上  十万渔盐民积极增产\n\n1946-05-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　山东三千里海岸线上\n    十万渔盐民积极增产\n    【新华社临沂十四日电】山东解放区北起河北之祁口、南迄江苏连云港，长达三千余里之海岸线上十万盐渔民，积极从事生产，已有二十余万亩盐田晒盐，二千余只渔船捕鱼，今年预计可产盐二十万万斤，鱼产仅胶东地区，今年至少产一万万斤。烟台、威海、石岛，均为华北著名之渔业重心。石岛又为全国四大盐场之一。据不完全统计：迄今民主政府已贷出款本币七千余万元，救济粮食十余万斤，救济渔盐民，并大量收买与推销存盐，以稳定盐价，仅胶东渤海两地，即收买推销食盐约六千万斤，并取消了敌伪时期的种种苛捐剥削，渔民盐民在反奸诉苦后，生产情绪大为提高。如拓汪盐田（属赣榆县）已由二千亩增至一万亩，产量由二十万担增至一百廿万担。羊角沟已由三十方滩？增至一百八十七方滩。十二月祁口以南盐民，今春又修筑击潮大围二十处，开辟新盐滩一万五千亩。胶东二万荒滩，正在积极修复中。今年较去年可增产三分之一，渔业可增至十倍以上，各地渔盐民，已成立渔盐业合作社，渤海已有十二处，胶东已有四十余处。规模较大者，为公私合营之烟台水产公司，拥有资金二百八十余万元，并设有大冷藏库，冻结室一所，能贮藏二百吨以上之水产品，渔民可免费委托该公司代卖且不低于市价，因之渔盐民生活大为改善，农民的副业收入，亦因而增加。滨海一地，今年可产盐七万万斤，运输可获利十万万元。"

During the adjournment, all unresolved issues should be studied by the assistants to the foreign ministers, and a draft peace treaty should be drawn up. (2) A peace conference should be convened on July 1st or 15th. (3) The revised armistice terms with Italy should be signed immediately. (4) The Austrian issue should be discussed when the Foreign Ministers Conference reconvenes. No decision was made on the above proposals. According to Reuters, \"France and Britain are expected to accept Bidault's revised draft on the armistice terms with Italy with very few amendments.\" Before Bidault made his proposals, the conference again discussed the issues of colonies, reparations, and the Italo-Yugoslav border in the peace treaty with Italy, and reviewed Austria's memorandum on the South Tyrol border. Since the foreign ministers still insisted on their original opinions, none of the above issues were resolved, and it was decided to hand them over to the assistants to the foreign ministers for study. At the secret meeting on the afternoon of the 15th, the German issue began to be raised. The Soviet Union agreed with the French opinion, advocating that the Ruhr issue should be discussed first, while the British side requested that general German issues be discussed first.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n人名 (People):\n贝纳斯   Bèi Nàsī (Bidault)\n\n地名 (Places):\n巴黎   Bālí (Paris)\n延安   Yán'ān\n意大利   Yìdàlì (Italy)\n奥地利   Àodìlì (Austria)\n南梯罗尔  Nán Tīluó'ěr (South Tyrol)\n鲁尔   Lǔ'ěr (Ruhr)\n\n组织机构 (Organizations):\n新华社   Xīnhuá Shè (Xinhua News Agency)\n路透社   Lùtòushè (Reuters)\n\n事件 (Events):\n巴黎外长会议   Bālí Wàizhǎng Huìyì (Paris Foreign Ministers Conference)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 巴黎外长会议搁浅  贝纳斯提议六月再开\n\n1946-05-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　巴黎外长会议搁浅\n    贝纳斯提议六月再开\n    【新华社延安十六日电】巴黎讯：十四日下午四外长秘密会议上，贝纳斯提议四点：（１）外长会议休会，延至六月十五日再开，在休会期间，一切未决问题，交由外长助理研讨，并草拟和约草案。（２）于七月一日或十五日召开和会。（３）立即签订已修改的对意休战条款。（４）外长会议复会时，应讨论奥地利问题。上述建议未获决定。据路透社称：“预计法英将以很少之修正而接受贝纳斯关于对意休战条款之修改草案”。贝纳斯发表其建议前，会议曾再次讨论关于对意和约中之殖民地问题、赔款问题及意南边界问题，并审查奥地利关于南梯罗尔边界之备忘录。由于各外长仍坚持其原来意见，上述问题俱无结果，乃决议交由外长助理去研讨。十五日下午秘密会议上，德国问题开始被提出，苏联同意法方之意见，主张首先讨论鲁尔问题，而英方要求先讨论一般的德国问题。"

    "content": "After the establishment of the Municipal Government in early November last year, the government led and assisted the people in carrying out an emancipation movement. In the struggle to liquidate the remnants of the enemy and puppets through the \"five antis\" (anti-corruption, anti-rationing, anti-exploitation, anti-espionage, anti-traitors), the people raised their heads, and the more than 20 million yuan that was cleared out was appropriately distributed to the people.\n\n　　Now, all 56 street chiefs in the city are elected entirely by the common people. In this way, the people have become the masters of Andong City. Pang Minhuang, the street chief of Renzhong Street, and Tian Bao'an, the deputy district chief of Yuanbao District, whom I visited, fully demonstrate this point. They were formerly rickshaw pullers, but now they demonstrate extraordinary talent in political work and are supported by the masses.\n\n　　The Municipal Government also carried out urgent relief work, providing relief to 1,001 households of revolutionary martyrs' families, with 94,305 jin of grain; providing relief to 5,091 poor households, with 384,182 jin of grain; providing relief to 420 worker households, with 87,987 jin of grain; and mobilizing the masses to help each other, providing 200,000 yuan in cash relief. During the Lunar New Year, there was not a single beggar on the streets of Andong City.\n\n　　It is not easy for the people of Northeast China, who have suffered 14 years of hardship, to awaken, but it is also the most important thing. The new democratic government abolished the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies of the enemy and puppet era, such as city resident tax, hiring tax, livestock tax, vegetable tax, and more than 20 other types of taxes, and encouraged the masses to freely buy and sell. It also distributed the properties and land confiscated from the enemy and puppets to the common people. More than 2,000 peasant and worker households in Langtou Village received land. The poor were allocated four \"tiandi\" (a measurement, reportedly six mu per day), and the least were allocated one \"tiandi,\" totaling more than 1,300 \"tiandi\" (7,800 mu) of enemy and puppet land. Even more significant is that after the people were emancipated, a large-scale production campaign was immediately launched. Now, many factories in the city have started operating. The Yalu River Paper Mill, Andong Textile Mill, Mudanjiang Paper Mill, and Andong Cigarette Paper Mill (the only one in Northeast China), which I visited, are all working intensely, and the increase in output is astonishing. For example, the Andong Textile Mill, formerly the \"Toyo Textile Mill\" during the Japanese puppet era, had more than 3,000 workers. In the past, the daily output was 50 bolts of cloth. Now, with fewer workers than before, the production has increased to 180 bolts of cloth per day. Zhou Guiliang, a 19-year-old female worker, gave me a good answer to this \"mystery\" of increased production. She said, \"In the past, we would pad the machines with whole bolts of cloth, and when the machines broke down, everyone could rest.\" Now things have changed because workers participate in the factory management committee, have their own trade unions, and many workers have been promoted to factory directors. Some have become street chiefs, and some have become councilors. Therefore, the machine factories that used to exploit workers have now become their own and have become a solid foundation for the democratic government. A total of 36 public factories have started operation, and 68 private factories have started operation. Mayor Lü also told me a gratifying proportional figure: the industrial and commercial businesses run by the Japanese have all stopped, and those run by the Chinese are gradually increasing. For example, there were originally two Chinese cotton ginning factories, and now there are six; there were originally 53 Chinese iron factories, four Korean factories, and eleven Japanese factories, and now there are 55 Chinese factories; there was originally one Chinese tannery, and now there are five; there were originally 190 Chinese grain stores, eight Korean stores, and five Japanese stores, and now there are 240 Chinese stores. This is because our democratic government has adopted a policy of protecting and supporting private industrial and commercial businesses. Education has also developed significantly along with the improvement of economic life. In the past, there were 20 elementary schools, and now there are 24. In the past, there were 12,158 students in the city, and now there are 13,166. Middle schools include the provincial high school, joint junior high school, Jianguo School, Military and Political School, and Lu Xun Academy of Arts. In terms of social education, many youth clubs, theater groups, night schools, and training classes have been established. More than 1,500 workers participated in literacy night schools, and more than 2,000 children participated in children's night schools.\n\n　　Mayor Lü's hard work and enthusiasm for serving the people have made everything in Andong City orderly and prosperous, so he received praise and support from all councilors at the first session of the Andong City Council.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n五反  Wǔ fǎn (Five Antis)\n仁忠街\tRénzhōng Jiē (Renzhong Street)\n庞民皇\tPáng Mínhuáng (Pang Minhuang)\n元宝区\tYuánbǎo Qū (Yuanbao District)\n田保安\tTián Bǎo'ān (Tian Bao'an)\n浪头庄  Làngtóu Zhuāng (Langtou Village)\n鸭绿江造纸厂\tYālùjiāng Zàozhǐchǎng (Yalu River Paper Mill)\n安东纺织厂\tĀndōng Fǎngzhīchǎng (Andong Textile Mill)\n牡丹江造纸厂\tMǔdānjiāng Zàozhǐchǎng (Mudanjiang Paper Mill)\n安东卷烟纸厂\tĀndōng Juǎnyānzhǐchǎng (Andong Cigarette Paper Mill)\n东洋纺织厂\tDōngyáng Fǎngzhīchǎng (Toyo Textile Mill)\n周桂良\tZhōu Guìliáng (Zhou Guiliang)\n吕市长\tLǚ Shìzhǎng (Mayor Lü)\n建国学校\tJiànguó Xuéxiào (Jianguo School)\n军政学校\tJūnzheng Xuéxiào (Military and Political School)\n鲁迅艺术学校\tLǔxùn Yìshù Xuéxiào (Lu Xun Academy of Arts)\n安东市\tĀndōng Shì (Andong City)\n东北    Dōngběi (Northeast China)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 广大群众分得土地人力车夫当了街长  人民翻了身生产大开展  经济生活上升教育显著发展\n\n1946-05-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　广大群众分得土地人力车夫当了街长\n    人民翻了身生产大开展\n    经济生活上升教育显著发展\n    去年十一月初，市政府成立后，政府领导与帮助人民进行了翻身运动，在反贪污、反配给、反剥削、反特务、反汉奸的对敌伪残余的清算斗争中，人民抬起头来，清算出的二千余万万元，都适当的分配给人民了。\n    现在全市五十六条街街长，完全是由老百姓选举出来的，这样，人民成为安东市的主人了。我所访问的仁忠街街长庞民皇，元宝区副区长田保安，就充分证明了这一点。他们以前是人力车夫，现在政权工作中表现出异常的才能，而得到群众的拥护。\n    市政府还进行了紧急的救济工作，救济抗属一○○一户，粮食九四三○五斤，救济贫民五○九一户，粮食三八四一八二斤，救济工人四二○户，粮食八七九八七斤，发动群众互助，救济现款二十万元。在过旧历年的时候，安东市街上就没有一个讨饭的人了。\n    东北人民受过了十四年的苦痛生活，苏醒是一件不容易的事，但也是最主要的事。新的民主政府取消了敌伪时代的苛捐杂税，如市民捐、雇人捐、畜牧捐、蔬菜捐等二十余种，鼓励群众自由买卖，还把没收敌伪的房产土地分配给老百姓，浪头庄两千多户农民和工人，分到土地，贫穷者有分到四天地（每天六亩）者，最少也分到一天地，共分了敌伪土地一千三百多天地（共七千八百亩），更有积极意义的，是在人民翻身之后，立刻开展了大生产运动，现在全市工厂很多开了工，就我参观过的鸭绿江造纸厂、安东纺织厂、牡丹江造纸厂、和安东卷烟纸厂（东北只此一处），都是紧张的工作着，而且产量的增加，是可惊的，比如安东纺织厂在过去日伪时代的“东洋纺织厂”，有三千多工人，过去每日产量为五十匹布，现在工人比以前减少，而生产量却增为每日一百八十匹布了。关于这一个增产的“谜”，十九岁的女工周桂良，给我一个很好的回答，她说：“过去把成匹的布往机器里垫，机器坏了，大家就能休息。”现在改变了，因为工人参加工厂管理委员会，有了自己的职工会，还有不少工人被提拔当了厂长，他们有的当了街长，有的作了参议员，因此以前吃工人血的机器工厂，现在变为自己了，而且成为民主政府的巩固基础。全部公营工厂已开工者三十六家，私营工厂开工者六十八家。吕市长还告诉我一个可喜的比例数字，日本人经营的工商业都停止了，中国人经营的在渐渐增加起来，如弹花工厂，原来中国人有二家，现在有六家了；铁工厂原来中国人有五十三家，鲜人有四家，日本人有十一家，现在中国人有五十五家；制革工厂中国人原有一家，现在有五家；粮谷店中国人原有一九零家，朝鲜人有八家，日本人有五家，到现在中国人有二四零家。这是由于我们民主政府采取了对于私营工商业保护扶助的政策的缘故。教育工作也都随经济生活的上升而有显著的发展，过去又有二十所小学校，现在有二十四所，过去全市有学生一二一五八人，现在有一三一六六人，中学校有省立高中及联合初中、建国学校、军政学校、鲁迅艺术学校。社会教育方面，成立了许多青年俱乐部、剧团、夜校、讲习班等，有一千五百多工人参加识字夜校、二千多儿童参加了儿童夜校。\n    吕市长的辛苦与人民服务的热情，使安东市一切井然有序，欣欣向荣，因此在安东市第一届参议会上，得到了全体参议员的称誉和拥护。"

    "content": "A Record of the Xinxiang Executive Group's Inspection in Meng County\n    Yù Míng\n    On March 25th, the Xinxiang group went to Meng County for investigation. The jeep departed from Xinxiang and arrived in Xiuwu County town in a little over an hour.\n\n    \"Report, a conflict occurred in Qian Dong Village, fifteen li southwest of Xiuwu. The Eighth Route Army attacked the National Army. Please send the group to investigate.\" This was the report from Chen, the regiment commander of the National Army garrisoned in Xiuwu, and Xu Wentao, the county magistrate.\n\n    The tone of the report made it sound like a very serious matter.\n\n    \"We'll go where there's gunfire,\" said American representative Colonel Wilson. The representatives of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party agreed. Xu Wentao also accompanied them. When they arrived at Qian Dong Village, it was garrisoned by Yang Yijiu's puppet troops, the people's executioner of Xiuwu, while Chen Fan Bridge to the west of the village was the Eighth Route Army's garrison. However, there was no sign of the Eighth Route Army attacking the puppet troops. Only the roads, big and small, connecting Qian Dong Village and Chen Fan Bridge had been destroyed by the puppet troops. At this point, the American representative became suspicious and asked the puppet troops' lieutenant colonel regimental deputy:\n\n    \"How many troops do you have stationed in Qian Dong Village?\"\n\n    \"One regiment,\" the puppet lieutenant colonel replied.\n\n    \"How many soldiers of the Eighth Route Army are in Chen Ru Bridge?\"\n\n    \"Twenty or thirty men. The Eighth Route Army attacks Qian Dong Village every night!\"\n\n    Wilson smiled coldly and retorted, \"You have a regiment and so many fortifications, and you're still building fortifications (at this time, forty or fifty people were building bunkers beside the three representatives). Do they dare to come and fight you with just twenty or thirty men? You just said there was a conflict here, where did it happen!\"\n\n    At this time, the puppet lieutenant colonel and the Kuomintang magistrate of Xiuwu County looked at each other, their faces turning red, speechless, standing there like wooden chickens. It was like a slapstick comedy of a dog biting a rubber ball—no meat was eaten, but they got a bellyful of anger and looked utterly defeated.\n\n    After this embarrassing situation, they were not reconciled, still wanting to pin the blame for destroying peace on the Eighth Route Army. Suddenly, they shifted their target and complained to Wilson, \"The Eighth Route Army is blockading traffic, and the people on both sides cannot travel freely. Please stop them, Colonel.\"\n\n    It was already three o'clock in the afternoon. The group had to hurry to Jiaozuo that day, so they returned to Xiuwu for lunch. When the jeep was five or six li away from Qian Dong Village, Colonel Wilson saw four large carts coming from the west and immediately called the driver to ask:\n\n    \"Where are you coming from?\"\n\n    \"From Jiaozuo.\"\n\n    \"Is this road to Jiaozuo easy to travel?\"\n\n    \"Yes, it is.\"\n\n    \"What's on the carts?\"\n\n    \"Coal.\"\n\n    Then, he saw large carts transporting coal from the coal station in the liberated area in the west to the east, one after another. Colonel Wilson saw that coal from Jiaozuo could be exported to the Kuomintang area in large quantities, and the transportation was very convenient. He couldn't help but smile and say, \"This is very good, very good!\"\n\n    So, the guys who wanted to shift the blame again got nowhere.\n\n    After the group finished eating in Xiuwu, they set off for Jiaozuo. Seven or eight li outside Xiuwu City, they entered the liberated area. There were only two sentries at the border, and the commander of the garrison, who had been waiting here with great anticipation for more than four hours, greeted them thirty li away. Along the way, the people, men and women, old and young, welcomed the peace envoys with the same feeling, hoping that they would bring them peace and that the Kuomintang would drive away the puppet troops who were ravaging the people as soon as possible. Although the weather was gloomy that day and the spring chill was still strong, their hopes were still so high.\n\n    Around five o'clock, the jeep arrived in Jiaozuo. The warm welcome from the local military and political leaders and the masses formed a contrasting scene to the situation in the Kuomintang area. The so-called petitioning \"masses\" in the Kuomintang-controlled areas were composed of hooligans, landlords, and disreputable people, all under unified arrangements, deliberately smearing saliva under their eyes to fake tears, each one like a ventriloquist, recounting the words of the people behind them.\n\n    Due to the rain, they didn't reach their destination—Meng County—until the afternoon of the 28th.\n\n    Brigade Commander Zhao Lantian and Meng County Magistrate Xu Songtao presented a report to the group. The report, with ironclad facts, narrated the Kuomintang's violation of the ceasefire order, crossing the Yellow River on January 14th to invade Meng County, and our side's inevitable recovery of Meng County, as well as the crimes of Zhang Bohua, who colluded with the enemy and betrayed the country. This long report was filled with blood and tears, and no one could remain indifferent after reading it. In the evening, hundreds and thousands of people welcomed the representatives of the group, with tens of millions of people sharing one heart, hoping that the Kuomintang troops would implement the ceasefire order and retreat to the south of the Yellow River, to their original defense lines of the 13th.\n\n    On the 29th, the group inspected our army's front lines, and we saw people singing on the roads and farmers plowing in the fields, a scene of peace. But in the afternoon, when we arrived in the area of the Kuomintang's 90th Army, the atmosphere of war was very strong, making one feel as if they were walking on a detonated grenade. Look: on both sides of the road, in the middle of the streets, the docks were next to the bunkers, the chevaux-de-frise followed by chevaux-de-frise, and there were continuous deep ditches and high walls. How could traffic be smooth! Wilson, seeing this situation, felt that the opinion of the CCP representative, Major General Huang Zhen, that traffic could not be restored without dismantling the bunkers in the Kuomintang area was correct.\n\n    On the morning of the 1st, so-called mass representatives were received and investigated at the resident of the Kuomintang's 90th Army 53rd Division.\n\n    \"When did the 53rd Division cross the river?\" Wilson asked.\n\n    \"January 13th.\"\n    \"January 13th.\"\n\n    Many representatives answered in unison, all speaking in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n    \"Are the people here so advanced?\" Major General Huang Zhen questioned, \"The vast majority of Chinese villagers only know the lunar calendar and not the Gregorian calendar. Why is it the opposite here? This fact fully proves that these so-called representatives have obviously been uniformly trained, and what they are saying is completely fabricated. Please pay attention to this, Colonel Wilson.\"\n\n    The Kuomintang representatives were speechless.\n\n    Colonel Wilson laughed heartily.\n\n    Wilson then asked two representatives in detail. They both replied that when the 53rd Division crossed the Yellow River, the north bank was the Eighth Route Army, and there was fighting during the crossing, but the gunfire was not very intense.\n\n    The fact that the Kuomintang army violated the order and attacked Meng County on January 14th is absolutely true. We firmly demand that the Kuomintang consider its credibility and immediately withdraw.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n人物\tPeople:\n\n毓明  Yù Míng\n陈团长  Chén tuánzhǎng\n徐文涛  Xú Wéntāo\n威尔逊  Wēi'ěrsūn\n杨义九  Yáng Yìjiǔ\n赵旅长  Zhào lǚzhǎng\n蓝田  Lán Tián\n徐松涛  Xú Sōngtāo\n张伯华  Zhāng Bóhuá\n黄镇  Huáng Zhèn\n\n地点\tPlaces:\n\n新乡  Xīnxiāng\n孟县  Mèng Xiàn\n修武县  Xiūwǔ Xiàn\n前董村  Qián Dǒng Cūn\n陈范桥  Chén Fàn Qiáo\n陈茹桥  Chén Rú Qiáo\n焦作  Jiāozuò\n河北  Héběi\n黄河  Huáng Hé\n\n组织机构\tOrganizations:\n\n新乡小组  Xīnxiāng xiǎozǔ\n八路军  Bālùjūn\n国民党  Guómíndǎng\n中共  Zhōnggòng\n九十军  Jiǔshí Jūn\n五十三师  Wǔshísān Shī\n\n时间\tTime:\n\n元月十四日 Yuányuè shísì rì\n一月十三号 Yī yuè shísān hào\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 新乡执行组孟县考查纪实\n毓明\n1946-05-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　新乡执行组孟县考查纪实\n    毓明\n    三月二十五日，新乡小组去孟县调查。吉普车由新乡动身，一个多钟头，即到了修武县城。\n    “报告，修武西南十五里处前董村发生了冲突，八路军向国军进攻，请小组前往调查。”这是修武国民党驻军陈团长及县长徐文涛的报告。\n    听这报告的口气，好像煞有介事，非常严重。\n    “那里有枪声，我们就往那里去。”美代表威尔逊上校说。国共两代表也同意这个意见。徐文涛氏也伴同前往。到了前董村时，这村驻的是修武人民刽子手伪军杨义九部，村西陈范桥为八路军的驻村。但并无八路军进攻伪军的迹象，只是前董村通陈范桥的大小道路都被伪军破坏了。这时美代表怀疑起来，他问伪军中校团副道：\n    “前董村你们驻了多少队伍？”\n    “一个团。”伪中校答称。\n    “陈茹桥有多少八路军？”\n    “二三十人。八路军每天夜晚进攻前董村！”\n    威尔逊冷笑了一下，又反问伪中校道：“你们有一个团，又有这样多的工事，现在还在做工事（这时三代表旁边有四五十个老百姓正在修碉堡），他们二三十人敢来打你们吗？你们刚才说这里发生冲突，在什么地方冲突的呀！”\n    这时伪中校及国民党修武县长，你看我，我看你，面红耳赤，哑口无言，像木鸡一样呆呆的站着。这像一幕狗咬皮球的滑稽剧——没有吃上肉，却吃了一肚子气，灰腾腾的。\n    碰了这一鼻子灰，但他们并不甘心，还想把破坏和平的帽子给八路军戴在头上，忽又转移目标，向威尔逊控诉道：“八路军封锁交通，双方老百姓都不能自由来往，请上校制止。”\n    此时已到下午三点，当天小组还要赶到焦作去，即折回修武吃中饭。当吉普车离开前董村五六里时，威尔逊上校见到从西面来了四辆大车，立刻把车夫叫到跟前询问：\n    “你们从那里来的？”\n    “从焦作来的。”\n    “这一条通焦作的大路好走不好走？”\n    “好走。”\n    “车上里是什么？”\n    “煤。”\n    接着又远远看见从西面解放区进村煤站向东运煤的大车，络绎而来。威尔逊上校看到焦作的煤可以大批向国民党地区输出，而且交通又很方便，不禁笑着说：“这，顶好顶好！”\n    于是想嫁祸于人的家伙，又落了个没趣。\n    小组在修武吃罢饭后，即往焦作出发。一出修武城七八里，就进入解放区，边境上只有两个哨兵，还有郊迎三十里的驻军指挥长官，他们早已在这里以满腔热望等候四个多钟头了。沿途老百姓，男男女女，老老少少，也以同样心情在欢迎和平使者，他们希望给他们带来和平，希望国民党早些驱散蹂躏人民的伪军。虽然这天天气阴晦，春寒料峭，但他们的热望仍是那么高。\n    约摸五点多钟，吉普车到了焦作。当地军政首长及广大群众，热诚欢迎的盛况，恰和国民党区域的情形，形成了相反的对照。国民党统治区所谓请愿的“群众，”有流氓，有地主，有不三不四的人，都受着统一的安排，故意在眼睛下边抹着唾沫当眼泪，个个像演双簧一样，述说着背后人的话语。\n    因天雨，二十八日下午才达到目的地——孟县。\n    我赵旅长蓝田和孟县县长徐松涛向小组呈了一个报告。那报告上，用铁的事实述说着国民党违犯停战命令，于元月十四日北渡黄河侵占我孟县和我方于不得已的情况下恢复孟县的经过，还有通敌叛国的张伯华的罪行。这篇长的报告，充满了血泪，谁看了也不能无动于中。晚间，成百成千的群众，欢迎小组各代表几千万人一个心，希望国民党军队执行停战命令，退到黄河以南十三日原防。\n    二十九日，小组视察我军前线，见我区行者歌于途，农夫锄于田，一片和平景象。但下午到了国民党九十军地区，这地方，战争气味非常浓厚，使人感到仿佛在拉开火线的炸弹上行走，你看：大路两旁，街道中间，码头挨着碉堡，鹿砦接着鹿砦还并有接连不断的深沟高墙。交通怎样通达呢！威尔逊目睹此种情形，感觉到中共代表黄镇少将所提国民党区不拆碉堡难以恢复交通的意见是正确的。\n    一号上午，在国民党九十军五十三师驻地接见所谓群众代表，进行调查。\n    “五十三师什么时候渡河的？”威尔逊问。\n    “一月十三号。”\n    “一月十三号。”\n    许多代表异口同声回答着，说的都是阳历。\n    “这里老百姓那么进步？”黄镇少将提出质问：“中国广大乡民大多数都只知道阴历。不知道阳历，为什么此地独相反？这事实充分证明，这些所谓代表显系经过统一训练，所说的完全是捏造的事实，请威尔逊上校注意。”\n    国民党代表等哑口无言。\n    威尔逊上校却大笑不已。\n    威尔逊又详细问了两个代表。他们均回答在五十三师过黄河时，河北面是八路军，过河时经过战斗，而目枪声不很激烈。\n    国民党军队元月十四日，违令进攻我孟县是千真万确的事实了。我们坚决要求国民党顾全信义立即撤退。"

    "content": "Under the impetus of correct commercial policies,\n    Xingtai City Sees a Surge in Businesses\n    [Xingtai City News] Merchants in Xingtai City, through their practical experience in the half-year since liberation, have come to recognize the commercial policies of our democratic government and are working together to develop commerce. The city is now thriving, with a rapid increase in the number of businesses. Before the war, the city had 1,270 stationary merchants. After seven or eight years of enemy and puppet rule, this number had dwindled to only 937 when our army liberated Xingtai. Now, the number has surged to 1,589, an increase of one-quarter compared to pre-war levels. While there were 534 street vendors during the Grand Temple Fair in November of last year, this number has now surged to 1,118. In addition, there are 38 new fur shops, 16 coal stations, and 17 hemp shops. Including public-private joint ventures, there are a total of 139 new businesses, not included in the aforementioned numbers of stationary merchants. In order to develop industry and commerce, our democratic government has established a reasonable burden system and abolished many exorbitant taxes and levies of the past. When collecting funds at the beginning of the year, the total amount levied from merchants was only 3.7 million yuan. This has prompted merchants to voluntarily compare the present government with the past. They said: \"In the past, formal taxes included central taxes, provincial taxes, and county fees, totaling 11 million yuan every six months. The additional, informal taxes were more than four times the formal taxes, completely without limit, making it impossible to do business. Now things are much better.\"\n    Clerks have had their salaries increased, while also taking care of the owners. Wage standards are determined through discussions and negotiations between both parties. The principle of regulation and mutual benefit is adopted in labor-capital relations. Clerks' morale is high, and managers and owners are also satisfied. From November of last year to the end of March of this year, the government issued 28.74 million yuan in commercial loans to 1,011 large and small shops (of which 823 were small businesses), which has played a significant role in the development of commerce.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\nPlaces:\n\n邢台市   Xingtai Shi\n\nOrganizations:\n\n人民日报 The People's Daily\n中国共产党 Chinese Communist Party\n\nEvents:\n\n大庙会  Dàmiàohuì (Grand Temple Fair)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 正确的商业政策推动下  邢台市商号激增\n\n1946-05-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　正确的商业政策推动下\n    邢台市商号激增\n    【邢台市讯】邢台市商人，在解放后半年来的实际体验中，认识了我民主政府的商业政策后，协力从事商业建设，现该市市都繁荣，商号激增。该市战前坐商一千二百七十户，经过七八年敌伪统治后，在我军解放邢台时仅为九百卅七户，现已激增至一千五百八十九户；较战前增多四分之一。虽贩在去年十一月大庙会时为五百三十四户，现激增至一千一百一十八户。此外，又新增皮毛店三十八户，煤站十六处，麻店十七处，连公营商业，共新增一百三十九处，这都不包括在上述坐商数字中。我民主政府为发展工商业，确定了合理的负担制度，取消了过去许多苛捐杂税；年初征款时，向商人所征的总共不过三百七十万元。这引起商人们自动与过去政府作比较，他们说：“过去正税有中央税、省税、县款的、半年就要出一千一百万元；而附加的非正式税则要超过正税四倍，完全无限制，使买卖没法做，现在可好了。”\n    店员增了资，同时也照顾了东家，工资标准是双方各自讨论后又协商订定的，劳资关系上采取了调节互利的原则，店员情绪高涨，经理东家也能满意。去年十一月至今年三月底，政府发放商业贷款二千八百七十四万元，贷给大小商店一千零十一家（其中小商占八百二十三户），这对商业发展起了相当作用。"

It is the best city I have seen since traveling from Chongqing to Beijing and Shenyang. The markets display piles of goods, food, and fruits. Countless ships are docked on the riverbank. At dawn, the factory whistles from near and far sound, awakening people from their sweet sleep. Everyone is working hard, with smiles of liberation on their faces.\n    On the 14th, I visited Mayor Lü Qien. He is a native of Andong, tall, and a tenacious, capable, and optimistic person. The improved material life and good social order that the people have achieved in just six months, as I have seen today, are inseparable from Mayor Lü's outstanding efforts.\n    He said: Andong City has a population of more than 300,000. The social order of Andong City was established on the basis of destroying the enemy puppet regime. After Japan surrendered on August 15th, Andong fell into extreme chaos. On September 17th, after the People's Self-Defense Forces entered Andong, the puppet mayor Cao Chengzong and other puppet special agents colluded with each other and secretly prepared for a New Year's Day riot. Fortunately, it was discovered by our Public Security Bureau in advance and suppressed. The planner, instigator, commander, and leader of this conspiracy riot, the Japanese special agent Yoshioka, had been a special agent in Changchun and Harbin for more than 20 years. The Kuomintang appointed him as the chief of staff of the Kuomintang Advance Army. They organized various special agent secret armed forces and later prepared several times for riots, all of which were discovered in advance. They also set fires everywhere. The Andong Court was burned down by the Japanese special agent Fujikyu, who was bought by the KMT special agents. Now Yoshioka, Fujikyu, and the Japanese who secretly organized the riots have all been arrested.\n    After walking on the streets twice at night, I know that Andong is now a city without police. But compared to the past, it is a completely different world. In the past, during the puppet Manchukuo era, there were no pedestrians during the day. During the \"Maintenance Association after August 15th\" era, there was robbery and chaos. Later, thanks to the people's automatic organization of self-defense forces to patrol various places, stability and peace were maintained here.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n安东\tAndong\n人民日报\tPeople's Daily\n刘白羽  Liu Baiyu\n安奉铁路\tAnfeng Railway\n鸭绿江\tYalu River\n重庆\tChongqing\n北京\tBeijing\n沈阳\tShenyang\n吕其恩\tLü Qien\n八一五\tAugust 15th\n曹承宗  Cao Chengzong\n公安局\tPublic Security Bureau\n阳历年\tNew Year's Day\n吉冈\tYoshioka\n长春\tChangchun\n哈尔滨\tHarbin\n国民党\tKuomintang\n国民党挺进军\tKuomintang Advance Army\n藤九\tFujikyu\n伪满时代\tPuppet Manchukuo Era\n维持会\tMaintenance Association\n自卫队\tSelf-Defense Forces\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 民主政府领导群众翻了身  安东已成人民乐土  城里没有警察街上没有乞丐\n\n1946-05-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　民主政府领导群众翻了身\n    安东已成人民乐土\n    城里没有警察街上没有乞丐\n    【新华社安东十六日电】本社记者刘白羽顷以“访问安东市”为题介绍安东市，全文如下：\n    我在安奉铁路的火车上睡了一夜，早晨就到了鸭绿江边的安东。\n    安东是一个美丽整齐繁荣的都市，是我从重庆到北京、沈阳以来所见到的最好的都市，商场里陈设着成堆的物品、食粮和水果，江岸停着无数的船舶，黎明的时候，远近工厂的气笛都响起来，唤醒了人们甜美的睡眠，所有的人都紧张的劳动着，面上浮着翻身后的笑容。\n    十四日，我访问了吕其恩市长，他是安东人，高大身材，是一个坚韧能干而乐观的人，今天我所见的在短短六个月中人民物质生活得到改善和良好的社会秩序，这与吕市长的卓异努力是分不开的。\n    他说：安东市有三十多万人口，安东市人民社会的秩序，是在摧毁敌伪政权基础上建立的。“八一五”日本投降以后，安东陷于极度混乱，九月十七日，人民自卫军进入安东后，伪市长曹承宗等伪特日特，勾结一起，秘密活动，准备阳历年暴动，幸事前被我公安局发觉，镇压下去了。这个阴谋暴动的计划者发动者指挥领导者日本特务吉冈，在长春哈尔滨干了二十多年的特务，国民党加委他为国民党挺进军参谋长，他们组织了各种名目的特务秘密武装，以后又几次准备暴动，都被预先发觉。他们还到处放火，安东法院就是国特收买日特藤九放火烧毁的，现在吉冈田藤九及秘密组织暴动的日本人，都被捕了。\n    我夜间在街路走过两次之后，知道现在安东是一个没有警察的城市，可是今天和过去比较，却是截然不同的两个世界了。从前伪满时代，白天不见行人，“八一五后维持会”时代，是抢劫与混乱，后来由于人民自动组织了自卫队，巡逻各地，才维持了这里的平稳与安乐。"

    "content": "Ji'ning, Daming, and Eleven Other Counties\n    Anti-Traitor Movement Launched One After Another\n    Over 80,000 People Involved in the Movement\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan] A fervent anti-traitor, revenge, and reckoning movement has successively unfolded in the Ji-Lu-Yu and Ji'nan regions. In the six counties of Ji'ning, Tai'an, Wenshang, Heze, Gaoling, and Zhangqiu in the Ji-Lu-Yu area, over 50,000 people have participated in the movement. In Ji'ning, under the eight years of enemy and puppet rule, the masses' thinking was deeply affected by poison. Therefore, the entire county first launched a propaganda movement to draw a clear line in the masses' thinking. In half a month, 208 villages involving over 10,000 people joined the movement. The masses recovered their seized interests from the hands of traitors and local bullies, totaling 400,9218 jin of grain, 1,237 mu of land, 2,423,650 yuan of Lu currency, and other items such as salt and matches. In the Shu district of the county, in just seven or eight days, 55 villages with over 4,000 people organized themselves in the movement. The Tai'an grievance-airing and revenge movement, after 5,000 people in villages around Xiazhang at the end of last month jointly settled blood debts with the bandit and local bully Wu Wuwu, has unfolded intensely. On the 3rd of this month, 16,000 people in Wenshang, in a joint action, publicly tried the puppet county magistrate Cao Ziting. Before the public trial, a large-scale parade and demonstration were held. The masses participating in the meeting fully recognized their strength. After returning to their villages, they actively guided the movement in their villages. In Heze city, thousands upon thousands of people have jointly publicly tried war criminals such as Sun Huafeng. The masses in the Zhucun area of Gaoling County are also jointly launching a reckoning struggle against the puppet Bao chiefs. For heinous traitors, the democratic government, accepting the demands of the masses, has imposed the death penalty according to law. The masses, after airing their grievances and taking revenge, are continuing to show rising enthusiasm for the reckoning struggle. In the five counties of Fudong, Daming, Baixiang, Weixian, and Xia in the Ji'nan area, the anti-traitor and revenge movement among the masses in the newly liberated areas is also developing fiercely like a prairie fire. Nearly 30,000 people from all walks of life have participated in the struggle, adopting forms such as joint struggles and public trial meetings, to air their grievances against over 20 traitors. With the support of the democratic government, the broad masses who have suffered untold torment have washed away eight years of blood debts. On April 15th, Fudong convened a public trial meeting of 10,000 people to reckon with the major traitors Liu Jinyue and Li Zhenbo. The heinous Liu Jinyue had led the enemy in countless \"sweeps,\" helping them capture over 130 of our workers. Then, the traitor Li Wencheng was brought forward, who fled to the Kuomintang-controlled area and was not only not punished but also became an official. The masses expressed their firm opposition to the Kuomintang's shameless behavior. In Baixiang, 2,000 people from 13 villages in the first district jointly struggled against five die-hard traitors, including Geng Fengwen. At the meeting, the masses wept bitterly, recounting eight years of grievances. On April 18th, in Daming, 7,000 citizens conducted a reasoning struggle against the traitors Yuan Tingde and Dan Lü'an. An old lady in her sixties and a child of thirteen both cried out in pain. On April 29th, thousands of people in the first district of Xiajin publicly tried the traitor Meng Xijiu. Over the past eight years, he had amassed a fortune by plundering the masses, acquiring over 140 mu of land and buying five houses, extorting over 16 million yuan from the people. This time, a thorough reckoning and compensation were carried out. Villages such as Qijizhen in Weixian also launched a joint struggle against traitors such as Li Buzhou.

    "title": "Rapid Advancement of Post-War Industrial Construction in the Soviet Union",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-05-19",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Soviet Post-War Industrial Construction Takes a Great Leap Forward\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th] Soviet heavy industry is the source of all Soviet defense forces, and therefore it has become one of the centers of the new Five-Year Plan. The general task of the new Five-Year Plan stipulates that the total industrial production should exceed the pre-war level by 48 percent, while the level of heavy industrial production is stipulated to exceed it by 100 percent, with steel increasing by 37 percent, iron by 35 percent, coal by 50 percent, kerosene by 14 percent, and electricity by 40 percent. The total investment in the new Five-Year Plan is 484 billion rubles, of which 234 billion rubles are invested in restoration work, and the rest is invested in expanding industry. According to Stalin's report at the voters' meeting on February 9th, the total amount of Soviet industrial production in 1940 was 137 billion rubles, with steel at 18.3 million tons, iron at 15 million tons, coal at 166 million tons, and kerosene at 31 million tons. Based on these figures, it can be inferred that the total amount of Soviet industrial production in the Fourth Five-Year Plan should reach 203.5 billion rubles, steel should reach 25.071 million tons, iron should reach 20.25 million tons, coal should reach 349 million tons, and kerosene should reach 35.34 million tons. Stalin pointed out that in the next fifteen years, the goal is to reach an annual production of 60 million tons of steel, 50 million tons of pig iron, 500 million tons of coal, and 60 million tons of kerosene. Although this number is very large, based on the current recovery situation in the Soviet Union, it can be seen that the Soviet Union is fully confident in completing this huge task.\n    In terms of the steel industry, the Soviet steel industry had four powerful centers before the war: the Eastern Center in the Kazakh region, the Southern Center in Ukraine and Crimea, the Caucasus Center, and the Far Eastern Novosibirsk Center. Except for the second center, which was partially damaged by the German invaders, the others have maintained constant development in production. Taking only the Magnitogorsk area in the Eastern Center as an example, the current total steel production has exceeded the pre-war level by more than 35 percent (annual production of 2.47 million tons of steel and 2 million tons of iron). Chelyabinsk's production has exceeded the steel production of any region in the Soviet Union by more than seven times. In the Southern Center, most of the smelting equipment has been repaired. In Krivoy Rog and Kerch in the region, some have already exceeded the pre-war level by last year. In Zaporozhye and Makeyevka, which suffered the most damage, it will also be possible to exceed the pre-war level before the end of this year. Other iron and steel industries in Stalingrad, which suffered heavy losses, will also reach pre-war levels in 1947. Powerful new steel factories near Leningrad in northwestern Soviet Union have all begun construction, and by 1950, the metal output will be 600,000 tons per year.\n    In terms of the coal industry, Soviet coal production is distributed in the Donets Basin, the Tula region in central Russia, the Urals, and the Sverdlovsk region. Among them, in the largest Donets Basin, as of the end of last year, 122 of the 135 large mines that were destroyed have been repaired, 136 mines have reached pre-war levels, and 41 have even exceeded them. The production volume in the Ural coal producing area has doubled the pre-war level in the past year alone.\n    In terms of the kerosene industry, the Soviet kerosene production centers are in Grozny in Dagestan, Azerbaijan, Krasnodar, and Sakhalin Island. Except for Krasnodar, which was partially damaged, the others are intact and have new equipment, such as the 880-kilometer-long oil pipeline from Grozny to the Donets coal producing area, and the 100-kilometer-long oil pipeline from Rostov to the Donets. The Soviet Union has the world's largest oil reserves, and three new regions were discovered during the war. For example, Baku's production of super aviation fuel reached the annual output before the war in March.\n    In terms of the power and machinery manufacturing industries, these two departments are currently the fastest growing departments in terms of productivity. Power production in the new Five-Year Plan will exceed the total power of the twelve years before the war, with an annual output of 82 billion kilowatt-hours. By the end of March, more than 70 percent had been restored to pre-war levels. One of the Soviet Union's largest power plants, Zebaastopol, and the Karelian power plant, which were thoroughly destroyed by the German invaders, were repaired by the end of last year, and their productivity has exceeded pre-war levels. The world-renowned Dnieper Power Plant has also been partially repaired and put into operation, and a power plant that is twenty times larger than the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Plant is currently under construction, and it is planned to restore the total power generation before the war by the end of this year. A significant feature of the new Five-Year Plan is the large-scale use of machinery. The production of heavy machinery manufacturing is expanding at an unprecedented rate. The production of steel plant equipment will increase from 2,800 tons in 1940 to 102,900 tons in 1950. The new Five-Year Plan will establish thirteen heavy machinery manufacturing plants. The machinery plant built in southern Ural will be one of the largest factories in the country. The work of converting munitions factories into machinery factories was completed in just a few months after the war. The largest artillery factory during the war is now manufacturing machines for all oilfield equipment, the tank factory has been converted into a factory manufacturing railway vehicle machinery, the mortar factory has been converted into a factory manufacturing textile machines, and the aircraft factory has been converted into a factory manufacturing light transportation equipment. The production scale of these factories is several times higher than the current level of all industrial production. For example, the production volume of the Moscow Vas Machinery Manufacturing Plant has more than doubled the pre-war level. The Red Proletariat Machinery Manufacturing Plant reached the same level as before the war by September last year. The Ural's ×Pisker Machinery Plant's output last year was three times that of the previous year. Soviet heavy industrial production exceeded the plan in the first quarter of this year, with iron exceeding by 1.7 percent, steel by 6.5 percent, rolled iron by 5.1 percent, and coking coal by 1.3 percent. Overall, Soviet heavy industry can not only complete but also exceed the plan. The amazing development of Soviet heavy industry will determine the path to world peace and happiness.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n苏联\tSūlián\tSoviet Union\n新华社\tXīnhuáshè\tXinhua News Agency\n延安\tYán'ān\tYan'an\n斯大林\tSītālín\tStalin\n哈萨克\tHāsàkè\tKazakh\n乌克兰\tWūkèlán\tUkraine\n克里米亚\tKèlǐmǐyǎ\tCrimea\n高加索\tGāojiāsuǒ\tCaucasus\n新西伯利亚\tXīnxībālìyǎ\tNovosibirsk\n马格尼托高尔斯克\tMǎgénítuō Gāo'ěrsīkè\tMagnitogorsk\n车里雅宾斯克\tChēlíyǎbīnīsīkè\tChelyabinsk\n克里沃罗\tKèlǐwòluó\tKrivoy Rog\n刻赤\tKèchì\tKerch\n萨波罗什\tSàbōluóshí\tZaporozhye\n马凯也夫卡\tMǎkǎi yě fū kǎ\tMakeyevka\n斯大林格勒\tSītālín gé léi dé\tStalingrad\n列宁格勒\tLièníngélè\tLeningrad\n顿尼兹盆地\tDùnnízī pén dì\tDonets Basin\n俄罗斯\tÉluósī\tRussia\n图拉\tTúlā\tTula\n乌拉尔\tWūlā'ěr\tUrals\n斯维德洛夫斯克\tSīwéidé luò fū sī kè\tSverdlovsk\n达吉斯坦\tDájísītǎn\tDagestan\n格罗尼斯\tGé luō nísī\tGrozny\n阿塞尔拜疆\tĀsè'ěrbàijiāng\tAzerbaijan\n克拉斯诺达尔\tKèlāsīnuòdá'ěr\tKrasnodar\n库页岛\tKùyèdǎo\tSakhalin Island\n巴库\tBākù\tBaku\n莫斯科瓦斯机器制造厂\tMòsīkēwǎ sī jīqì zhìzào chǎng\tMoscow Vas Machinery Manufacturing Plant\n红色普罗列塔利亚机器制造厂\tHóngsè Pǔluōliè tǎ lì yǎ jīqì zhìzào chǎng\tRed Proletariat Machinery Manufacturing Plant\n×皮斯克机器厂\t×Písīkè jīqì chǎng\t×Pisker Machinery Plant\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏联战后工业建设突飞猛进\n\n1946-05-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏联战后工业建设突飞猛进\n    【新华社延安十四日电】苏联重工业是苏联一切国防力量的源泉，因此它便成为新五年计划的中心之一。新五年计划的总任务中，规定整个工业生产量，要超过战前的百分之四十八，而重工业生产的水平，则规定要超过一倍，其中钢增加百分之三十七，铁百分之三十五，煤炭百分之五十，煤油百分之十四，电力百分之四十。新五年计划之总投资为四千八百四十万万卢布，投于恢复工作者为二千三百四十万万卢布，其余则投于扩充工业。据斯大林二月九日在选民大会上的报告，一九四零年苏联工业生产的总量，共计一千三百七十万万卢布，钢为一千八百三十万吨，铁一千五百万吨，煤炭一万万六千六百万吨，煤油三千一百吨。根据此数字，可以推测第四个五年计划苏联工业生产的总量，应达到二千零三十五万万卢布，钢达到二千五百零七万一千吨，铁二千零二十五万吨，煤炭三万万四千九百万吨，煤油三千五百三十四万吨。斯大林指出在今后的十五年中，要达到年产钢六千万吨，铣铁五千万吨，煤炭五万万吨，煤油六千万吨。这个数字虽然非常巨大，但根据苏联目前恢复情形，可以看出苏联完全有把握去完成这巨大的任务。\n    在钢铁工业方面，苏联的钢铁工业在战前有四个强大的中心，哈萨克区域的东方中心，乌克兰与克里米亚的南方中心，高加索中心，及远东的新西伯利亚中心，除了第二个中心受到德寇部分破坏外，其他均保持生产恒常的发展，仅以东方中心的马格尼托高尔斯克一区来说，目前钢铁生产总量已超过战前的百分之三十五以上（年产钢二百四十七万吨，铁二百万吨），车里雅宾斯克拉生产已超过苏联任何一区钢生产的七倍以上。在南方中心，熔炉设备大部已告修复，该区的克里沃罗与刻赤，至去年若干已超过战前水平，在损失最重的萨波罗什与马凯也夫卡，也能在今年年底以前，超过战前水平。他如损失惨重的斯大林格勒钢铁业，在一九四七年亦将达到战前水平。苏联西北列宁格勒附近各强大新钢铁工厂，均已动工，到一九五零年，金属产量将年产六十万吨。\n    在煤炭工业方面，苏联煤炭生产分布在顿尼兹盆地，俄罗斯中部图拉地区，乌拉尔，斯维德洛夫斯克区，其中最大的顿尼兹盆地，截止去年年底，被破坏的一百三十五座大矿井中，已有一百二十二座已经修复，一三六座矿井已达战前水平，四十一座并已超过。乌拉尔产煤区生产量，仅在去年一年，即超过战前二倍。\n    在煤油工业方面，苏联的煤油生产中心，在达吉斯坦之格罗尼斯、阿塞尔拜疆、克拉斯诺达尔、库页岛，除克拉斯诺达尔遭部分破坏外，其他完好如常，并有新的装备，如格罗尼斯至顿尼兹煤产区的八百八十公里长的输油管，罗斯托夫至顿尼兹的一百公里长的石油管。苏联石油储藏量，是世界第一位，在战时又发现了三个地区。如巴库的生产超能飞机燃料，三月份的产量就达到战前一年的产量。\n    在电力与机器制造业方面，这两部门是目前生产力发展最迅速的部门，电力生产在新五年计划中将超过战前十二年之总电力，年产八百二十万万基罗瓦特，至三月底已有百分之七十以上恢复到战前水平。受德寇彻底破坏的苏联最大发电厂之一的寨巴斯托波尔，和卡累利亚发电厂，在去年年底就已修复，而且生产力已超过战前。世界驰名的德涅泊电厂，亦已部分修复开工，目前正在建造一超过德涅泊水电厂二十倍的发电厂，并计划在今年年底要恢复战前发电总量。新五年计划的显著特点，是大规模使用机器，重机器制造业正以空前速度扩充，钢铁工厂装备的生产，到一九五零年，较之一九四零年要从二千八百吨增至十万二千九百吨。新五年计划将建立十三个重机器制造厂，乌拉尔南部建立的机器厂，将为全国最大工厂之一。军火工厂转化为机器工厂的工作，在战后不到几个月，即已完成，战时最大的大炮工厂，现在正在制造一切油田装备的机器，坦克工厂已改为制造铁路车辆机械的工厂，迫击炮工厂已改为制造纺织机工厂，飞机工厂已改为轻便交通用具工厂。这些工厂的生产规模，几超过目前一切工业生产水平，例如莫斯科瓦斯机器制造厂生产量，已超过战前一倍以上，红色普罗列塔利亚机器制造厂，到去年九月即已达同战前水平。乌拉尔的×皮斯克机器厂，去年的产量达到前年的三倍。苏联重工业生产，在今年第一季即已超过计划，铁超过百分之一·七，钢百分之六·五，卷铁百分之五·一，焦煤百分之一·三。综观以上，苏联重工业不但能完成，且能超过计划，苏联重工业的惊人发展，将决定世界和平幸福的道路。"

Since May, the civil war has spread to the provinces of Hebei, Henan, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Shandong. Among the Kuomintang troops attacking these provinces, there are also a large number of former puppet troops who were incorporated. At the same time, Chinese and foreign newspapers unanimously condemned the U.S. military for helping the Kuomintang army fight the civil war and demanded the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China. The New York Herald Tribune and the British Tribune, in analyzing the reasons for the expansion of the Chinese civil war, both pointed out that the Kuomintang right wing is implementing a go-slow approach to political reconciliation and has achieved considerable success. The Herald Tribune also pointed out that the Kuomintang government has not yet released political prisoners, disbanded the secret police, or given the people the power to freely express their will. Shanghai Wenhui Bao and other newspapers unanimously pointed out that the United States is seriously involved in the Chinese civil war, with the Kuomintang army obtaining artillery and other weapons from the United States and using them to slaughter Chinese people. At the same time, U.S. warships are transporting American-trained Kuomintang troops to various combat areas to oppose the CCP army. World News Review magazine, when commenting on the expansion of the Chinese civil war not long ago, pointed out that the U.S. authorities have not yet implemented the Moscow Conference's decision to withdraw foreign troops from China.

    "content": "【Xinhua News Agency, Handan】The seven million people in eighteen counties along the old course of the Yellow River in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region have issued an appeal to their compatriots in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, urging them to jointly prevent the Kuomintang reactionaries' plot to flood five provinces. The full text is as follows:\n\n　　To our fellow compatriots in the provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, south of the Yellow River:\n\n　　Since the Kuomintang breached the Yellow River in 1938 (民国二十七年) and diverted its course southward, you have suffered the pain of Yellow River floods for eight years. We deeply sympathize with you. \"All people under heaven are one family.\" Therefore, we do not oppose the Yellow River returning to its old course. However, you must understand that we have suffered from Yellow River floods for thousands of years. From 1913 (民国二年) to 1937 (民国二十六年) alone, the Yellow River breached its banks twelve times, drowning countless elders, brothers, sisters, and destroying countless fields, houses, and properties. Especially after the War of Resistance Against Japan, we have suffered eight years of enemy disaster and two years of natural disaster, causing deep wounds. Moreover, the dikes along the old course have been largely destroyed. If they are not repaired first and the water is suddenly diverted north, we will face the catastrophe of all the land becoming a swamp and all the people becoming fish. Therefore, we have repeatedly demanded that the Kuomintang government first repair the dikes and dredge the river, and then block the breach and release the water. During the construction, they should also repair the dikes along the new course to prevent the flooded area from expanding and actively provide relief to the vast number of disaster-stricken people in the new flooded area. Although many negotiations have been held and agreements have been reached, they have all been overturned by the Kuomintang. Recently, they have disregarded the opinions and lives and property of our thirty million people, completely ignoring the dike repair and river dredging projects, as well as the relocation and relief efforts. They are only accelerating the blocking of the Huayuankou breach, aiming to close it and release the water by the end of this month to coordinate their military operations, attack our liberated areas, and destroy our people. Compatriots! Can we seven million people sit and wait for death? No, we must urgently mobilize, rise up together, save ourselves, and defend ourselves, preventing the water from flooding north. If that happens, the Yellow River will be raging, whether it flows south or north is unpredictable. Therefore, this issue is now not only a problem for the people of our Hebei-Shandong-Henan three provinces, but a common problem for our compatriots in the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. Now, in order to avert this ancient catastrophe, at this critical moment, we appeal to you with the utmost sincerity. Our only common solution now is to unite and wage a life-and-death struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries, forcing them to immediately stop the breach blocking project and abandon the crime of releasing water, so that we have the opportunity to dredge the river, repair the dikes, and relocate and resettle the residents in the riverbed. Otherwise, we will all perish under the Kuomintang reactionaries' malicious policies.\n\n　　Compatriots, save us! Saving us is saving yourselves.\n\n　　Seven million residents in eighteen counties along the old course of the Yellow River in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region, kowtowing.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n黄河\tHuang He (Yellow River)\n花园口\tHuayuankou\n冀鲁豫区\tJi Lu Yu Qu (Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region)\n邯郸\tHandan\n新华社\tXinhua News Agency\n豫皖苏\tYu Wan Su (Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu)\n国民党\tGuomindang (Kuomintang)\n民国\tMinguo (Republic of China)\n抗战\tKangzhan (War of Resistance Against Japan)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 制止国民党水淹五省  冀鲁豫沿河七百万居民  向豫皖苏同胞呼吁团结起来救人自救\n\n1946-05-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　制止国民党水淹五省\n    冀鲁豫沿河七百万居民\n    向豫皖苏同胞呼吁团结起来救人自救\n    【新华社邯郸讯】冀鲁豫区沿黄河故道十八县的七百万人民，顷特向豫皖苏三省同胞发出呼吁，要求共起制止国民党反动派放水危害五省人民之阴谋，全文如下：\n    黄河南岸豫皖苏各省同胞公鉴：\n    黄河自民国二十七年被国民党决堤改道南迁以后，八年来你们已备尝黄河水灾的苦痛，我们非常同情，“天下百姓是一家”，所以我们并不反对黄河归复故道，但你们必能了解我们受黄水的灾害有数千百年之久，仅民国二年至二十六年黄河决口即达十二次之多，不知淹死了我们多少父老兄弟姊妹，不知冲毁了我们多少田地、房屋、财产。特别抗战以后，我们经了八年敌灾，二年天灾，创剧痛深，兼之故道堤坝大部毁坏，如不先加修复，而遽然驱水北来，我们就立有地尽泽国，人尽鱼鳖之惨祸。因此我们再三再四的要求国民党政府，首先复堤浚河，然后堵口放水，并在工程进行期间修理新道堤岸，防止泛区扩大，并积极救济新泛区广大灾胞。虽经多次谈判，多次订立协议，但均被国民党所推翻，近更置我三千万人民之意见及生命财产于不顾，丝毫不管复堤浚河等工程及迁移救济等问题，只加紧花园口堵口工程，限本月底合龙放水，以配合其军事行动，进攻我解放区，毁灭我人民。同胞们！我们七百万人岂能坐以待毙吗？不，我们只有紧急动员，一致奋起，自救自卫，阻水北泛。若然，则黄水滔天，或南或北，殊虽逆料。因此，现在这一问题已不仅是我们冀鲁豫三省人民的问题，而是我们冀鲁豫皖苏五省同胞的共同问题，我们现在为了挽回此亘古浩劫，当此时机紧迫之际，仅以十二万分的诚意向你们呼吁，我们现在惟一的共同良策，就是一致团结起来向国民党反动派作生死斗争，使其立即停止堵口工程，抛弃放水罪行，让我们有浚河复堤，迁移安置河床居民的机会，否则我们将在国民党反动派的恶毒政策下同归于尽。\n    同胞们，救救我们，救了我们也就是救了你们自己。\n                冀鲁豫区沿黄河故道十八县七百万居民同叩"

During the discussion of Byrnes' four proposals on the 14th, it was unanimously agreed that the conference would adjourn as soon as the German question was discussed on the 16th, and reconvene in Paris on June 15th. Amendments to the Italian armistice terms were also passed after slight revisions. Regarding the date for the peace conference, Byrnes requested that it be left for the June 25th meeting. Molotov stated that the Soviet Union did not object to holding the peace conference at any time, but it required the unanimous agreement of the four powers on the peace treaty, as decided by the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. Byrnes' attempt to force the Soviet Union to accept the opinions of the United States and Britain by using the majority of small countries (estimated to be about fifteen or sixteen) he could control at the peace conference was sternly rejected by Molotov. The suggestion to place the Austrian question on the agenda for the next meeting was also rejected by the Soviet side. Molotov stated in this regard that the question was not included in the procedures stipulated by the Potsdam Conference, and that important issues such as the Italian peace treaty had not yet been resolved, so no further troubles could be created. Molotov also rejected Bevin's suggestion (which requested that the foreign ministers exchange opinions on the Austrian question through normal diplomatic channels). At the morning meeting on the 15th, while discussing the German question, Byrnes proposed appointing a special committee to study and investigate the entire German-related issues, while seeking an agreement on the German peace treaty, in order to submit a report to the reconvened Foreign Ministers' Conference, and proposed another peace conference to be held as soon as possible on November 12th.

All attacks were unsuccessful.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Siping Street, 16th] The Siping Front's defense battle, thanks to the heroic resistance of the Democratic Allied Forces, has seen a period of lull. However, various indications show that the Kuomintang troops are now beginning a new offensive. Between the 18th and 29th of last month, the Kuomintang troops launched eight offensives, with the most intense being the four attacks on the 21st, 22nd, 23rd, and 29th, all of which were repulsed by the Democratic Allied Forces. After these battles, the front reached a stalemate. Recently, the Kuomintang troops transferred the main force of the New 6th Army and the 88th Division of the 71st Army from Southern Manchuria to the Siping Street front, and also concentrated several aircraft in Shenyang for support. On the 14th and 15th, fierce fighting broke out again on the front.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Siping Street, 16th] Yesterday, the front saw fierce fighting all day. At 8 AM, two divisions of the Kuomintang 71st Army launched a fierce attack on the Democratic Allied Forces' positions in Zhao Jiagou and Ren Jiatun, charging six times and firing over 3,000 artillery shells. The Democratic Allied Forces rose up to resist, repulsing them and leaving over 300 enemy corpses behind.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Bai Chongxi, who had been traveling between Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, Xi'an, and Jinan earlier this month to arrange the civil war, returned to Nanjing on the 9th.

    "content": "【Xinhua News Agency, Yangcheng Dispatch】 The cultural and educational movement in the entire Taiyue region has rapidly developed along with the mass movement and production movement. According to statistics from 34 counties in the region: (1) Last winter, there were 6,397 winter schools with 463,563 students, more than double the number in 1944. Yangcheng alone increased from 496 schools to 1,019 schools, and the number of students increased from 25,647 to 73,502. (2) There were 5,699 primary schools in the region, more than double the number in 1944, with a total of 204,775 students, of which 441 were people's schools. Primary schools are generally divided into three types: one type is established in villages where the rent reduction and production movement is well developed, and the masses have an urgent need for cultural learning, often with labor heroes as the core. Such as Cao Guangliang's Yanjia坪 Primary School in Qinyuan, and Shi Zhenming's Songshan Primary School in Fushan. Their characteristic is that the masses manage themselves, there are no restrictions on gender or age, and learning is closely integrated with production. Another type is run by model teachers to adapt to the specific situation of rural areas and cooperate with the masses. For example, in Yangcheng Gulong Primary School, the teacher Wei Kecheng changed Gulong Primary School into a people-run complete primary school in order to solve the various difficulties for men and women in the village to go to school in other villages. The third type is in areas with sparse population and scattered residences, where teachers adapt to the needs of the masses and take turns teaching in various villages, such as Anze and Jishi, which are very common. (3) There are six middle schools in the region with 904 students, an increase of two schools and 500 students compared with 1944, and five normal schools. The learning method is that students raise questions, and everyone discusses and learns from each other. (4) There are 2,100 reading groups in the region, divided into two types: one type is based on mutual aid groups, and reading groups are established to read newspapers during production breaks. The other type is village cadre reading groups, where cadres read newspapers when they meet every day. Cultural and recreational activities are also very active in the region. There are 522 rural theater troupes, with 1,371 actors, and 2,190 Yangge teams, with 109,550 actors. The content of the performances is closely related to the central work, and the actors do not leave production. Yangcheng alone has 75 rural theater troupes.\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 12th】 Luzhong's worker-peasant culture and education have achieved remarkable results. Among the 7,078 villages in the region (excluding border areas), there are 9,200 people's schools with approximately 230,000 students; more than 5,000 women's literacy classes with approximately 120,000 students; 2,080 newspaper reading groups with 15,200 people, and more than 9,000 blackboards. The Luzhong Dazhong Newspaper alone can receive more than 2,000 articles from workers and peasants every month. There are 3,600 primary schools with more than 139,000 children attending school. In Youjia庄, Linyi, before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were 490 illiterate men and women in the village, accounting for 96% of the total population. Now, 97 people in the village can write letters and keep accounts, 59 boys and girls have entered primary school, and those who are literate account for 47% of the village's population.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n太岳  Taiyue\n阳城  Yangcheng\n沁源  Qinyuan\n曹光亮  Cao Guangliang\n燕家坪小学  Yanjia Ping Primary School\n浮山  Fushan\n石振明  Shi Zhenming\n松山小学  Songshan Primary School\n卫克成  Wei Kecheng\n固隆小学  Gulong Primary School\n安泽  Anze\n冀氏  Jishi\n莱阳  Laiyang\n鲁中  Luzhong\n临沂  Linyi\n尤家庄  Youjia Zhuang\n鲁中大众报社  Luzhong Dazhong Newspaper\n抗战前  Before the War of Resistance Against Japan\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n秧歌  Yangge\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳群众翻身后  大众文化广泛发展  鲁中区成立民校九千余处\n\n1946-05-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太岳群众翻身后\n    大众文化广泛发展\n    鲁中区成立民校九千余处\n    【新华社阳城讯】太岳全区文教运动，随群运与生产运动而迅速开展，据全区三十四县的统计：（一）去年冬学六三九七座，学员四六三五六三人，较四四年增加一倍多。仅阳城即由四九六座增加到一○一九座，学员由二五六四七人增加到七三五○二人。（二）全区小学五六九九座较四四年增加一倍，共有学生二○四七七五人，其中有民办四四一座。小学一般分三种类型：一种是在减租生产运动开展好的村，群众有文化学习的要求迫切，多以劳动英雄为核心设立的。如沁源曹光亮的燕家坪小学，浮山石振明的松山小学等。其特点是群众自己管理，不限制性别和年龄，学习与生产密切结合。一种是模范教员适应农村具体情况和配合群众办的，如阳城固隆小学，教员卫克成因解决本村男女去外村上学的种种困难，将固隆小学改为民办完小。第三种为人口稀少住地分散地区，教员适应群众需要轮流到各村教学，如安泽、冀氏等地皆很普遍。（三）全区中学六座学生九○四人，较四四年增二座，学生增加五百人，师范五座。其学习方法是学生提出问题，大家讨论互相学习。（四）全区有读报组二千一百个，分为两种：一种以互助组为单位，成立读报组，在生产休息时进行读报。一种为村干部读报组，每天干部开会时读报。全区文娱也极活跃，农村剧团五百二十二个，演员一三七一人，秧歌队二千一百九十队，演员一○九五五○人，出演的内容都是与中心工作密切配合，演员都不脱离生产。仅阳城即有农村剧团七十五个。\n    【新华社莱阳十二日电】鲁中工农文化教育，获得显著成绩，全区七○七八（边沿区除外）村庄中，即有民校九千二百处，学员二十三万人左右；妇女识字班五千多处，学员约十二万人；读报组二千零八十组，人数一万五千二百，黑板报九千余所。仅鲁中大众报社，每月即能收到二千余篇工农的投稿。小学三千六百处，上学儿童有十三万九千多人。临沂尤家庄，在抗战前全庄男女文盲有四百九十人，占总人口百分之九十六，现在全庄能写信记账的有九十七人，已入小学的男女儿童五十九人，识字的占全庄人口百分之四十七。"

Workers' branches in each pit have voluntarily set their own production increase plans and labor discipline, launching production competitions. During the movement, output has increased daily, exceeding the original standards and catching up to pre-war levels. Tai'an Well originally aimed for 55% of the planned output per person, but within three days, it reached 78%. Before the movement, the average daily output per person at Shuanghe Well was 50% (half a ton). Starting from the 7th, the first branch of workers conducted a review, studied and reorganized the coal mining organization, strengthened the division of labor, and production efficiency increased daily. On the 12th, thirty-nine workers working in the kiln produced forty-one tons of coal, creating a highest record of average output of 1.06 tons.

A wave of support for the troops is developing universally in cities and villages.

In recent days, various organs, organizations, and schools throughout the city have visited wounded soldiers eight times.

The Xifeng County Girls' School wrote in a letter of comfort to the front lines: \"You are a good backing for the people of Northeast China, and we resolutely support you!\" Representatives from the Changyi District Trade Union and Farmers' Association in Jilin County, after comforting the wounded soldiers, said with tears in their eyes: \"They are too hard-working!\" All staff members of the Jilin China-Soviet Friendship Association wrote in a letter of comfort: \"We vow to resolutely advance along your glorious path!\" The masses in Jiangbei District of Jilin City said: \"We, the people in the rear, don't know how to thank you enough, we can only repay you by working hard to cultivate the land and produce more.\" All members of the Jilin City Medical Association also sincerely wrote letters to comfort the wounded soldiers, saying: \"Please recuperate peacefully, we are willing to do our best to help you recover your health as soon as possible.\" More than 40 people from the Andong Hui Muslim Association and 500 members of the Central District Trade Union of Andong City went to the hospital to comfort the wounded soldiers.

At the opening of the meeting, the heroic and valiant people's soldiers marched into the park in orderly steps and stood solemnly in front of General Li Zhaolin's tomb to pay their respects. The meeting was declared open, and Xie Yuqin, the chairman of the presidium, delivered a speech in a pleasant and passionate tone. He said: \"The Democratic Allied Forces have brought infinite happiness to the people of Harbin, warmed every desolate heart, it is our strong national defense, the lighthouse of new democratic construction, and our great savior! They rescued us from the clutches of the Japanese robbers with their heads and blood, giving us freedom and security of life.

    "content": "掀石碑\n    ——淮安石塘区佃户翻身记\n            顶在头上的千斤闸\n    Inside the Yamen on the Millet Street in Huai'an city stood a large stone tablet, erected in the fifth month of the seventh year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty, one hundred and twenty years ago. The feudal landlords of Huai'an based their \"strict punishment of wicked tenants, seizure of fields, and resistance to rent\" on the words on this tablet. The tablet read: \"Henceforth, should any unlawful tenants continue on their misguided path, once reported by the landlords, they will be immediately apprehended and severely punished according to the detailed regulations, and judged severely according to the law, without leniency. All you tenant farmers, do not test the law, lest you bring guilt and tears upon yourselves.\" The tablet also recorded the crimes of the tenants, such as \"stubborn tenant,\" \"crafty tenant,\" and \"sly tenant.\" How many tenants were unjustly put to death under the guise of \"testing the law,\" or forced to leave their homes and villages? How many tenants, not daring to \"test the law,\" were sucked dry of their blood, fattening their \"masters\"? A farmer named Zhang pointed to the stone tablet and said: This is a thousand-jin gate pressing down on our heads.\n            向秦老板算帐\n    Tenant farmers in Shiqiao District, Huai'an, accounted for eighty percent of the district's population. The landlords were mostly large landowners from Huai'an city. After the New Fourth Army liberated Shiqiao District last autumn, a democratic government was established, and after the struggle against traitors, the masses plunged into a tide of reckoning. First, more than 160 tenant farmers from Jiaochang, Geli, Longdi, Eqian, and the four surrounding villages settled old accounts of illegal exploitation with the landlord Qin Shiliang. \"Boss\" Qin was the number one big landlord in Shiqiao District, owning six thousand mu of land and employing more than 160 tenant families. In addition to the regular rent, he demanded that tenants \"borrow\" wheat, three dou per mu each year, called \"pre-borrowed wheat,\" but this \"pre-borrowed\" wheat was never returned. Paddy fields generally did not produce much in the spring, but tenants still had to send three sheng per mu to \"Boss\" Qin for making soy sauce, called \"soy sauce brine.\" The \"Boss'\" family also employed many stewards and servants. The expenses of these people also came from the tenants, who had to pay three sheng of grain per mu per year, generally called \"small rent.\" In the autumn, when the stewards went to the villages to inspect the rice harvest, the tenants had to give them money. For every shi of rice, five dou were added, called \"viewing the rice fee.\" Each season, when the stewards went to the villages to collect rent, the tenants had to take turns preparing dishes and inviting them to eat, and the dishes had to be of the highest quality. The rent calculation was extremely harsh, including river boundaries and bank boundaries, which were all included in the rent payment, called \"illusory fields and actual rent.\" If the head of the tenant's family died, and the land was inherited by his descendants, a paper had to be changed, and money had to be paid for the change, called \"writing the field axis.\" When collecting rent, the \"Boss'\" peck measured one dou and two sheng when tenants measured one shi, this was Qin's custom, called \"large peck and large dou.\" When the enemy was present, all the pseudo-fees borne by the \"Boss\" were forced to be paid by each tenant household. There were dozens of these fees, called \"substituting pseudo-fees.\" Tenant Wang Dingsan, who farmed three mu of land, only had two mu and six fen. Last year, he harvested four shi, but three shi were taken away for rent. Plus the large peck measure, which took away six dou, and twelve reserve tickets were spent on \"providing meals,\" resulting in only one dou left for himself to eat. This time, the tenant farmers of Shiqiao District sent representatives to the city to invite \"Boss\" Qin to the villages to settle accounts. The tenants near ten li settled accounts with him first, but it was fruitless due to Qin's arrogance and unreasonableness. The next day, a settlement conference of more than 300 tenant farmers from the four villages was convened. At the meeting, everyone spoke out about the words that were suppressed in their hearts one after another:\n    \"In the 26th year of the Republic of China, you increased the rent by two dou per mu, was that right or wrong?\" \"You used a twelve-dou peck measure to collect rent, was that right or wrong?\" \"You also made us dig ditches and build weirs without paying us, was that right or wrong?!...,...,... \" The tenants continuously raised questions, demanding settlement. Each time a question was raised, the crowd would shout like thunder, \"Not right!\" \"Yes!\" Old grandmothers who had never dared to speak in public also squeezed forward in the crowd and said tremblingly, \"For one meal, I spent five dou of rice. When my family provided meals, the stewards complained that the chickens and ducks were too small and wanted to overturn the table.\" Everyone shouted in unison, \"Take out the exploited grain!\" Tenant Zhou Hu, not to mention the regular rent, had been illegally exploited of twenty-six shi and six dou of grain over the years. The tenants demanded that \"Boss\" Qin take out the illegally exploited grain within a limited time. One tenant shouted in the crowd: \"They eat pork and white rice, we eat thin soup, we can't stand being hungry! He must take out six hundred shi of grain within three days.\" Under the legitimate reasons and strong pressure from the tenants, \"Boss\" Qin finally lowered his head and admitted to returning the illegally exploited grain to the tenants. He first paid part of the grain, and if it was not enough, he was willing to convert it into rice land. Since there were many tenants, there was no time to calculate in detail, so a settlement committee was established on the spot to conduct detailed calculations.\n            掀掉镇压佃户的石碑\n    After the tenants of Shiqiao District held this conference, everyone wanted to discuss how to go to the city to ask the landlords to settle accounts. One early morning, more than four thousand tenants gathered in the Dragon King Pavilion. In order to unify their actions, command posts were established in each village, and a general command post, a propaganda team, and a communications group were also established. The district farmers' association was guiding the masses, and more than ten mu of open space were filled. A \"getting hands on\" (得手) team was also organized to report news from the city to the outside. This sound spread from one corner to another, and everyone was stirred up! The hearts of more than four thousand people were surging, eager to rush into the city. Around ten o'clock, the team entered the city from the South Gate, mighty and like a dragon. At the front were two huge banners of \"Shiqiao District Farmers' Association\" and \"Inviting Landlords to Return to the Villages to Settle Accounts,\" followed by two large flags, \"Opposing Unreasonable Exploitation\" and \"Thoroughly Reducing Rent and Interest.\" After entering the city, the tenants dispersed and went to the landlords' homes to invite the \"Bosses\" out. Immediately, deafening gongs and drums sounded in the city, and several flags flew in the air. Red and green slogans also appeared on the walls of the streets. The propaganda team explained the significance of inviting the landlords to the villages to reduce rent to the audience on the streets. Landlords' residences were surrounded by crowds in dozens of places. Each village also established \"reception centers\" in the city, specifically for the landlords who were invited to the villages to rest. The landlords were invited to the reception centers one after another, and the sound of gongs and drums rang again. Under the big flags, the famous big landlords of the city were invited to rest in the reception centers, surrounded by dozens of people.\n    The command post asked the tenants to gather at the stadium immediately. In less than an hour, more than two thousand tenants had gathered. One tenant stood on a high pile and said passionately: \"We must sweep away the stone tablet in the county Yamen. This is the landlords' magic weapon, which suppresses the farmers in the southeast villages, and does not allow the tenants to turn over.\" \"Yes!\" \"Yes!\" \"Go! Go! Go!\" The tenants below shouted in unison, and more than two thousand tenants stirred up! Like a mountain of people and a sea of people pressing down, young people were running, and old people and women were also walking quickly, rushing to the gate of the county Yamen. Some were looking for ropes, some were looking for stone hammers, and some were grabbing the top of the tablet and chanting \"stubborn tenant,\" \"crafty tenant,\" and \"wicked tenant.\" The crowd was filled with anger. One tenant pointed to the stone tablet and said: \"You have been pressing down on our heads for more than a hundred years!\" When the angry farmers pulled the rope tied to the stone tablet, the \"stone tablet\" built by the feudal landlords of Huai'an to suppress the tenants, which was meant to be \"eternal and long-lasting\" and weighed a thousand jin, collapsed with a bang! Applause was like thunder, and the deafening gongs and drums sounded loudly again. The big stone pressing on their hearts was destroyed, and the oppressed turned over. The roar of triumph and the unbridled laughter lasted for a long time. An old man surnamed Zhang among the tenants was almost moved to tears and said: \"The thousand-jin gate on our heads is destroyed!\" More than four thousand tenants were victorious! The huge procession, beating the gongs and drums of victory, pulled the landlords to the villages. After arriving in the villages, the tenants of each village organized rent settlement delegations or groups to conduct settlement separately. During the settlement, the tenants were very generous and still conducted the settlement in a reasonable manner. The tenants were very generous. In more than twenty cases of excess exploitation, only three to five or one to two types were selected to settle with the \"Boss,\" but the number was still very large, which showed how terribly the landlords had exploited the tenants in the past. After the landlords admitted their mistakes, the tenants made significant concessions.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    Zhongguo (China)\n新四军   Xinsijun (New Fourth Army)\n秦士良   Qin Shiliang\n王鼎三   Wang Dingsan\n周虎     Zhou Hu\n张       Zhang\n\n淮安    Huai'an\n石塘区  Shiqiao Qu (Shiqiao District)\n臼街     Jiu Jie (Millet Street)\n衙门     Yamen (Government Office)\n教场     Jiaochang\n各里     Geli\n龙堤     Longdi\n鹅钱     Eqian\n体育场   Tiyuchang (Stadium)\n龙王阁   Longwang Ge (Dragon King Pavilion)\n\n道光     Daoguang\n清朝     Qingchao\n民国     Minguo (Republic of China)\n\n石塘区农民联合会   Shiqiao Qu Nongmin Lianhehui (Shiqiao District Farmers' Association)\n\n反对无理剥削   Fandui Wuli Boxue (Oppose Unreasonable Exploitation)\n彻底减租减息   Chendi Jianzu Jianxi (Thoroughly Reduce Rent and Interest)\n顽佃   Wandiàn (Stubborn Tenant)\n刁佃   Diaodiàn (Crafty Tenant)\n狡佃   Jiaodiàn (Sly Tenant)\n预借麦  Yujie Mai (Pre-borrowed Wheat)\n酱卤   Jianglu (Soy Sauce Brine)\n小租   Xiaozu (Small Rent)\n倍头   Beitou\n看稻费  Kan Dao Fei (Viewing the Rice Fee)\n虚田实租  Xu Tian Shi Zu (Illusory Fields and Actual Rent)\n写田轴  Xie Tianzhou\n大斛大斗  Da Hu Da Dou (Large Peck and Large Dou)\n代出伪费  Dai Chu Wei Fei (Substituting Pseudo-fees)\n得手    Deshou (\"Getting Hands On\" team)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 掀石碑——淮安石塘区佃户翻身记\n\n1946-05-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　掀石碑\n    ——淮安石塘区佃户翻身记\n            顶在头上的千斤闸\n    淮安城里臼街衙门里面有一个大石碑，是在前清道光七年五月立的，迄今有一百二十年。淮城的封建地主就是照碑上的话来“严惩恶佃霸田抗租”，碑上写着：“嗣后倘有不法佃户仍蹈前辙，一经业户呈控，定即严拿，依照详定规条从严惩办，按律治罪，决不宽贷，尔等佃农，慎勿以身试法，致干罪泪。”碑上并记载着佃户的罪状，“顽佃”“刁佃”“狡佃”等。多少佃户在“以身试法”下，被无辜处死，或被迫离乡背井，多少佃户不敢“以身试法”而被吸尽了血，养肥了“主人”。一个姓帐的农民指着石碑说：这是顶在我们头上的千斤闸。\n            向秦老板算帐\n    淮安石塘区佃户占了该区人口的百分之八十，业主多是淮城的大地主。新四军去秋解放了石塘区以后，民主政权建立了，群众在反奸斗争之后，卷入了清算的热潮，首先是教场、各里、龙堤、鹅钱、四乡，一百六十多家佃户，和地主秦士良清算过去违法剥削的旧帐。秦“老板”是石塘区的头号大地主，有田六千亩，佃户有一百六十多家，除正租外，他要向佃户“借”麦，每年每亩三斗，叫做“预借麦”但这个“预借”从来不曾还过。水田一般春季出产东西不多，但要照例每亩送三升给秦“老板”做酱，叫做“酱卤”。“老板”家还用了许多管事先生和仆人。这些人的开支也要出在佃户身上，每亩田每年要纳粮三升，通叫做“小租”。秋天管事先生下乡看稻收成，佃户要送钱给他。每石稻要出五斗“倍头”，这叫做“看稻费”，每季管事先生下乡收租，佃户们要轮流办莱请他们吃饭，菜一定要上等的。收租计算十分苛刻，连河界岸界都算在内，照数纳租这叫做“虚田实租”。如果佃户的家长死了，由子孙继承，要换纸，换纸还要出钱，这叫做“写田轴”。收租时老板的斛子，要量佃户的一石二斗才合到他家一石，此为秦家惯例，叫“大斛大斗”。敌人在时，一切老板负担的伪费，逼着每家佃户代出。这些费有几十种，这叫做“代出伪费”。佃户王鼎三，种三亩地，只有二亩六分，去年收四石，交租就去掉三石；加上大斛一量，去掉六斗，又被“供饭”花去十二张储备票，结果只剩一斗自己吃了。这一次，石塘区佃户们派代表到城内请秦老板下乡，十里附近的佃户先和他清算，由于秦的蛮横无理没有结果。次日乃召开了四乡三百余人的佃户算帐大会，在会上大家一个接一个吐出压在心里的话：\n    “民国二十六年，你每亩加二斗，错不错呀？”“你用十二斗一石的大斛收租，错不错呀？”“你又叫我们挑沟挖圩，不拿钱，错不错？！……，……，……。”佃户们连续不断的提出质问，要求清算，每当提出一项质问时，人群中即发出“不错呀！”“对呀！”雷一样的高呼，从来不敢在人前说话的老奶奶，也在人堆里向前直挤，颤巍巍的说：“为供一次饭，我花五斗米，我家供饭，管事的还嫌鸡鸭小，要掀桌子。”大家异口同声的发出巨大的怒吼，“把剥削的粮食拿出来！”佃户周虎除正租不谈，几年来，额外剥削的粮食就有二十六石六斗：佃户，要求秦老板限日期拿出额外剥削的粮食，一个佃户在人群中高叫：“他们吃的猪肉白米饭，我们吃的稀汤，经不起饿呀！他三天内拿出六百石粮来。”在佃户的正当理由与强大压力下，秦老板终于低下了头，承认将过去非法剥削退回给佃户。先付出部分粮食，不够并自愿以稻地折算。由于佃户多，来不及一一细算，当场成立下算帐委员会，进行算细帐。\n            掀掉镇压佃户的石碑\n    石塘区佃户开了这个大会后，大家要讨论怎么进城请地主算帐，一天清早四千多佃户在龙王阁会齐后，为使行动统一，各乡分别设立指挥部，又成立了总指挥部，宣传队、通讯组等，区农会在指导着群众，十余亩的广田都被站满了，还组织了专门从城内到城外报告消息的“得手”，这声音从这一角传到那一角，大伙儿听了全部骚动起来了！四千余人心在动荡，急急要冲进城去，十时左右，队伍从南门进城，浩浩荡荡如同一条龙，前面是两幅“石塘区农民联合会”，“请地主回乡算帐”的巨大横额，紧接着两面大旗，是“反对无理剥削”，“彻底减租减息”。进城后，佃户们即行分散，分别至业主家请出老板，立刻城内响起了震天的锣鼓声，几幅大旗在空中飞舞着，红绿色的标语，也在大街墙壁上出现了。宣传队在街头上向观众们解释着请地主下乡减租的意义，有几十处地主的住宅，人群围着。各乡并在城内设立了“招待所”，专为被请下乡地主休息的，地主们接连不断的被请到招待所，锣鼓声又响起来了。大旗下边，全城著名大地主在几十个群众的簇拥下，亦被请到招待所去休息了。\n    指挥部请佃户立即到体育场集合，不到一小时，已集结佃户二千余人，一个佃户站在高堆上激昂的说：“县衙门那块石碑我们要去扫掀掉，这是地主的法宝，是镇压东南乡种田人的，叫佃户不得翻身。”“对！”“对！”“去！去！去！”下面的佃户，齐声的喊，二千余佃户哄动起来了！象人山人海倒压下去，年青人在奔跑，年老人、妇女也快步走着，拥到了县衙门口。有的在找绳子，有的找石锤子，有的抓住碑的顶上在念着什么“顽佃”“狡佃”“恶佃”，群众怒气冲天，一个佃户指着石碑说：“你压在我们头上一百多年了！”当愤怒的农民将套在石碑上的绳子一拉，淮城封建地主为镇压佃户而建立的满想“永垂久远”、千斤重的“石碑”轰然倒下来了！鼓掌好似雷鸣，喧天的锣鼓又大声的响起来了。压在心头的大石头毁了，被压迫者翻身了，狂呼声纵情的欢笑声，历久不绝。佃户中一个姓张的老头子几乎感动得流出泪来说：“在头上的千斤闸可毁啦！”四千余佃户胜利了！巨大的行列，敲着胜利的锣鼓，拉着地主下乡去了。到乡后，各乡佃户，即分别组织算租账代表团或小组进行结算。在算账时，还是以讲理方式进行，佃户表现得很宽大。在二十多宗超额剥削中，只选出三五种至一二种与老板结算，但其数仍甚巨大，可见地主过去对佃户剥削之惨重。佃户们在地主认错后，又作了重大的让步。"

After accepting the \"Imperial Order,\" Yoshida issued a statement on the formation of the cabinet, stating: \"In view of the urgent food situation, the Emperor ordered me to form a cabinet as soon as possible. I want to quickly form a national cabinet (referring to a coalition cabinet of reactionaries including the Liberal Party, the Progressive Party, and the National Cooperative Party).\" The last broadcast from Tokyo on the evening of the 16th stated: Takashi Saito, the leader of the Progressive Party, will serve as the new cabinet's Minister of Home Affairs and Minister of State. Yoshida's rise to power is a step taken by the Japanese ruling class to try to make up for the divisions that occurred after the general election in order to deal with the increasingly developing Japanese democratic front. The reason why Kijuro Shidehara brought out Yoshida was because Yoshida was a bureaucrat close to Shidehara's father-in-law, the Mitsubishi Zaibatsu, and also a pro-Shidehara figure in the Liberal Party (backed by the Mitsui Zaibatsu). In a sense, Yoshida's new cabinet is an extension of the Shidehara cabinet, still an anti-democratic cabinet dominated by the Mitsubishi Zaibatsu's forces. Yoshida is a moderate diplomat bureaucrat of militarism. In 1919, he was a member of the Japanese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. In 1924, he served as the Japanese Consul-General in Shenyang, actively supporting the Northern Warlords in opposing the Chinese people, and striving to invade our Northeast and Mongolia, and was a well-known conspirator against China at that time. In 1938, he served as Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. In 1930, he served as the ambassador to Italy and soon transferred to the ambassador to the United Kingdom, colluding with British and American appeasement figures, before returning to Japan before the July 7th Incident. Yoshida has connections with Japanese court officials and major Zaibatsu.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n**Named Entities**\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n人物\tPeople:\n片山哲\tKatayama Tetsu\n吉田茂\tYoshida Shigeru\n斋藤隆夫\tSaito Takashi\n币原喜重郎\tKijuro Shidehara\n\n组织\tOrganizations:\n新华社\tXinhua News Agency\n社会党\tSocialist Party\n自由党\tLiberal Party\n进步党\tProgressive Party\n国民协同党\tNational Cooperative Party\n三菱财阀\tMitsubishi Zaibatsu\n三井财阀\tMitsui Zaibatsu\n北洋军阀\tNorthern Warlords\n\n地点\tPlaces:\n延安\tYan'an\n东京\tTokyo\n沈阳\tShenyang\n意大利\tItaly\n英国\tUnited Kingdom\n中国\tChina\n东北\tNortheast\n蒙古\tMongolia\n\n事件\tEvents:\n巴黎和会\tParis Peace Conference\n七七事变\tJuly 7th Incident (also known as the Marco Polo Bridge Incident)\n\n专有名词\tSpecial Terms:\n敕命\tImperial Order\n国民内阁\tNational Cabinet\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 日本组阁风波暂告平伏  战犯吉田茂组新阁\n\n1946-05-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　日本组阁风波暂告平伏\n    战犯吉田茂组新阁\n    【新华社延安十七日电】东京讯：延续二十五天的日本组阁风波，已于十六日下午因社会党书记片山哲的组阁失败和日皇正式授命新任自由党总裁吉田茂为新阁首相而告一段落。吉田接受“敕命”后，并发表组阁声明称：“鉴于紧急的粮食情况，天皇命余尽速组阁，余欲迅速组成一国民内阁（按即包括自由党、进步党、国民协同党的反动派的联合内阁）。十六日晚东京最后广播称：进步党首脑斋藤隆夫将出任新阁内相及国务大臣。按吉田上台，是日本统治阶级企图弥补大选以后所发生的分裂，以便对付日益发展的日本民主阵线的一个步骤，币原之所以拉出吉田，是因为吉田是与币原的岳父三菱财阀接近的官僚，又是在自由党（以三井财阀为背景）中亲近币原的分子。吉田新阁在某种意义上说，是币原内阁的延长，仍旧是以三菱财阀势力为主的反民主内阁。吉田为军国主义稳健派外交官僚，一九一九年为日本出席巴黎和会代表团的随员，一九二四年任日驻沈阳总领事，积极支持北洋军阀反对中国人民，并力谋侵犯我东北和蒙古，为当时著名的侵华阴谋家。一九三八年任外务省次长，一九三○年任驻意大使，不久转任驻英大使，与英美绥靖主义分子勾结，至七七事变前返日。吉田与日本宫廷重臣及大财阀，均有联系。"

Under the leadership of the trade unions, workers have signed production contracts with the capitalists. Working hours have generally been reduced from 15-20 hours in the past to 12 hours, and wages have also increased. Mine owners obtain net profits accounting for about 45-50% of the total profits, which is a significant increase compared to their income during the enemy-puppet rule. Furthermore, due to the improvement in workers' lives, production efficiency has generally increased by 20-50% compared to before liberation, and capitalists' profits have also increased accordingly. Currently, many mine owners are working on repairing transportation routes and purchasing water pumps. Wang Baoyuan of the Jin Feng Coal Mine Company said, \"Last year, I still had some concerns, but now I clearly see that the democratic government takes care of the interests of both labor and capital.\" He has already raised funds to start repairing the mine. The total number of coal mines has now reached 194, a fourfold increase compared to the time of enemy occupation. Workers' lives have significantly improved. Thousands of workers have changed into new clothes, and the severe \"slack season\" unemployment problem of previous years has also been resolved. Landless workers are concentrated in the perennial kilns for coal mining. Workers have surplus grain, some have redeemed their land and married wives. Chen Qi, a coal worker from Qingyuan, was even elected as a member of the Border Region Council.

A symposium was held on the battlefield, attended by more than ten Kuomintang military officers of platoon level and above. During the symposium, Wang Huamin, a senior Kuomintang military colonel and staff officer, said, \"After I was captured, I thought I was a prisoner, but who knew I would become an honored guest.\" He was deeply moved by the generosity and benevolence of the Democratic Allied Forces. Then, he said with shame, \"I was dissatisfied with three things there: First, the Baojia system and the unequal conscription system, where wealthy families with five brothers would not be drafted, while the only son of poor families would be drafted; second, the abuse of force, which was nicely called 'taking over' this time, but was actually fighting a civil war; third, economic control, where bureaucratic capital monopolized everything, the legal tender depreciated, prices soared, and the people were in dire straits.\" Then, Sun Chengwu, a sergeant platoon deputy, said painfully, \"I was forcibly conscripted into the army in 1938. This time we were sent to Xinmin County, and only then did we hear from our superiors that there were too many bandits to eliminate, but after we inquired, we learned that they were the patriotic and people-loving Eighth Route Army, so many brothers were unwilling to fight.\" Wang Ruifang, a student-turned-20-year-old lieutenant platoon leader, said, \"When we engaged with you, knowing that you were the Eighth Route Army, my courage disappeared.\" He said angrily, \"I hope to go home. If you need us to defend peace, I will resolutely work here.\" Peng Jinrong, the acting platoon leader, said painfully, \"It is most shameful for Chinese people to take American weapons, wear American clothes, and fight Chinese people!\" Peng Zhiyuan, a lieutenant company deputy, explained more sincerely, \"The country needs peace, democracy, and unity, but the Kuomintang reactionaries want to fight a civil war.\" Xu Shuyan, a second lieutenant platoon leader, said, \"We are unwilling to shed blood for personal conspiracies.\" A total of eight officers were bidden farewell on this occasion, expressing their gratitude to the Democratic Allied Forces before their departure and saying that they must act according to their conscience in the future and never fight a civil war again.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 17th] After the Kuomintang reactionaries seized Anshan, they appointed Zou Chengqing, a habitual bandit nicknamed \"Chicken Killing King,\" as the mayor of Anshan City.

    "content": "Nanchang Dispatch\n　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th】Nanchang Dispatch: After eight years of devastation by the enemy in Jiangxi, over 76% of the province's cities and villages present a scene of tragedy, ruin, and desolation. According to preliminary statistics from the Jiangxi Provincial Statistics Office, the province suffered over 500,400 casualties, people's property losses amounted to 93 million yuan, and over 269,000 head of cattle were lost during the eight years. The war is over, and the people hope for recovery, but they are now facing another terrible disaster—famine, widespread epidemics, and endless exorbitant taxes.\n　　Taking Nanchang as an example, since the arrival of victory, prices have been soaring, especially grain prices, which have taken the lead, increasing dozens of times in more than half a year (Note: In March, each stone reached 30,000 yuan, and it is now far beyond this figure). The people who have suffered from the enemy and puppets naturally have no money to buy rice to fill their stomachs and have to use grass roots and tree bark to prolong their remaining lives. In Ga'an, De'an, Fengxin, Shanggao, and other counties in northern Jiangxi, there are often no people for dozens of miles, and 3 to 4 million mu of farmland are barren. The cattle have been slaughtered, and the seeds have been looted. In the Pingxiang area of western Jiangxi, there was also a drought last year that had not been seen in decades, with the early rice harvest failing completely and the late rice harvest being less than 30%. They are now in a severe spring famine.\n　　Epidemics and famine are like twin brothers. This spring, the black hand of the plague has once again arrived, and other infectious diseases are also prevalent in the south. A meningitis outbreak occurred in Yudu's Yinkeng Town, killing more than 50 villagers in less than a month. Subsequently, outbreaks were also discovered in Xingguo, Yongxiu, and near Nanchang. Recently, the prevalence of measles and smallpox in Nanchang and Jiujiang can be said to have broken all previous records! The authorities are completely unconcerned about this.\n　　While the people are groaning and crying out for food, the government has apportioned a huge amount of 2 million shi of grain. Taking the small county of Xiajiang as an example, with a current population of only over 30,000, the number of surplus grain levied has been allocated as high as 100,000 shi. Based on the current population, even including breastfeeding infants, each person has to contribute three shi of grain. In addition to the grain levy, the local bao and jia heads are all bloodsuckers.

After narrating the facts of the Kuomintang authorities' deliberate attempt to flood our Hebei-Shandong Liberated Area, the telegram urgently stated: \"At this moment, 30 million people in our border region are filled with resentment and boiling with anger, vowing to spare no sacrifice to save and defend themselves. The entire region is now mobilized to prevent the floodwaters from flowing north. Although the outcome is unpredictable, the will of the people is united and the anger of the masses is hard to quell. If the Heze Agreement is not implemented and the damming project is not immediately stopped, our 30 million people will inevitably be forced to take risks. Even if they face swords and spears and risk death, they will certainly have a way to save and defend themselves. In that case, it is uncertain whether the flooding will occur to the south or to the north. Who is the culprit, who is the criminal, the world and future generations will have their own judgment. Compelled to this point, we have said all we can say. Whether it is a disaster or a blessing, to go or to stay, we hope you will consider it carefully!\"\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan] On the 15th of this month, Hebei-Shandong-Henan People's Representatives Wu Zheqing, Zhang Huayi, Shen Jipan, Pei Yuming, Hu Yangping, Gu Zihui, Gong Jingren, Yang Hanzhang, Chen Liting, Gao Zhenwu, An Jingwu and other 723 people telegraphed to Nanjing National Government Chairman Jiang, stating: \"Recently, the authorities have disregarded the Heze Agreement and instead considered blocking the river mouth and flooding the people as a good plan. Is there anyone in the world who governs rivers with such disregard for human life and such cruel and brutal behavior?! If Jiang Tingfu and others are allowed to act recklessly and blindly, how will Your Excellency explain when the floodwaters inundate the provinces of Hebei and Shandong? Because, while the government has the freedom to block the river mouth and divert water, the people have their own method of fighting to the death to defend themselves. If the government breaches the dam, the people will also breach the dam. When the floodwaters flow horizontally and overflow the sky, the responsibility will rest where it belongs. Rather than chaos without governance, it is better to have governance without chaos. What to do, whether to destroy the country or to revitalize the country, depends on one word from Your Excellency.

The letter pointed out that the fact that the Franco government threatens universal peace and democracy has been well known for years, so further investigation is unnecessary. The committee strongly stated that the United States should provide material assistance to Spanish anti-fascist fighters, recognize the exiled Republican government, and have the United Nations announce a blockade of the Franco government and any other so-called provisional government representing fascism. The committee expressed great regret over the attitude taken by the U.S. representatives in the Security Council and declared: the United States' continued trade with Franco's Spain is a violation of the lives and blood of tens of millions of Americans who sacrificed themselves to eliminate fascist countries and to make all mankind more mutually understanding, cooperative and secure.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th dispatch] According to a New York Times dispatch from Madrid: Franco's Spain is restoring its policy of openly hostile to the Allied countries, which it had temporarily retreated from at the end of World War II, and openly restoring the rule of its Falange (Spanish Fascist Party). At the end of World War II, Franco, seeing the situation was unfavorable, announced the \"dissolution of the Falange.\" The newly established Congress is not representative at all. In the 467 seats, the government occupies an overwhelming advantage of almost 400 seats. Among the government personnel appointed by Franco, most are well-known pro-Nazi elements who were attacked and removed from office by the Allied countries, including the cunning former Foreign Minister Lequerica and General Vigon, who openly sympathized with Germany. The police adopted new tactics, attacking a political party for a certain period. The first to be attacked was the Communist Party, followed by union members and the Socialist Party, especially concentrating on attacking their leaders. The above facts are in line with Franco's recent repeated warnings, saying: \"If the world does not allow us to look outward, then we will turn around and look inward.\" The telegram stated: It is undeniable that the United Nations representatives are generally disappointed with the development of the political situation in Spain.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\nOrganizations:\n\n美争取和平全国委员会 National Committee for Peace\n联合国    United Nations\n安全理事会 Security Council\n长枪党    Falange\n共产党    Communist Party\n社会党    Socialist Party\n\nPeople:\n\n杜鲁门  Truman\n卡尔逊  Carlson\n罗伯逊  Robeson\n贝纳斯  Byrnes\n斯退丁纽斯  Stettinius\n佛朗哥  Franco\n勒古利卡 Lequerica\n维岗  Vigon\n\nPlaces:\n\n延安    Yan'an\n华盛顿  Washington\n波兰    Poland\n西班牙  Spain\n马德里  Madrid\n\nEvents:\n\n第二次大战 World War II\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美争取和平委员会上书杜鲁门  敦促美政府封锁佛朗哥\n\n1946-05-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美争取和平委员会上书杜鲁门\n    敦促美政府封锁佛朗哥\n    【新华社延安十七日电】华盛顿讯：以著名海军军团上校卡尔逊与黑人歌王罗伯逊为主席的争取和平全国委员会（前译争取和平机构），十五日致函杜鲁门、贝纳斯与斯退丁纽斯，敦促美政府立即支持波兰在安全理事会上的建议，由安理会采取措施，消除以佛朗哥为代表的威胁。该函指出佛朗哥政府威胁普遍和平与民主的事实，已是数年来众所周知之事，因此进一步调查是不必须的，该委员会力称：美国给西班牙反法西斯战士以物资援助，承认流亡的共和政府，并由联合国宣布封锁佛朗哥政府及代表法西斯主义之任何其他所谓临时政府。该委员会对美国代表在安理会上采取的态度，表示极大遗憾。并宣称：美国继续与佛朗哥西班牙贸易，是违反成千万为了歼灭法西斯国家及使整个人类更趋于相互谅解合作安全而牺牲生命与流血的美国人的。\n    【新华社延安十七日电】据纽约时报马德里专电：佛朗哥西班牙正在恢复其在二次大战结束时曾退避一时的公开敌视盟国的政策，并公开恢复其长枪党（西班牙法西斯党）的统治。按二次大战末期，佛朗哥见势不佳，曾宣布“解散长枪党”，最近成立的新国会，完全不是代议性的，在四百六十七个议席中，政府几乎占四百席的绝大优势。在佛朗哥委任的政府人员中，大多数为前被盟国攻击而下台的著名亲纳粹分子，包括狡狯的前外长勒古利卡，及公开同情德国的维岗将军。警察采用新战术，在一定时期攻击一个政党，首遭攻击的是共产党，次为职工会员及社会党，尤其集中攻击他们的首领。以上事实，恰与佛朗哥近一再发出的警告相符，他说：“世界如不让我们向外看，那么我们就回过头来向内看”。该电称：联合国代表对西班牙政局发展，咸表失望，是无可讳言的。"

Starting from March 10th, after the meetings of people of all ethnic groups, the Chahar League People's Representative Congress was formed. Subsequently, Sabule gave a report on the establishment of branch meetings of various banners and the banner governments. After reading the letter from Inner Mongolian people's leader Yun Ze to the congress, representatives enthusiastically took the stage to speak. On the second and third days of the congress, proposals on local autonomy, finance, economy, culture and education, government work, and freedom of migration were hotly discussed. Through bottom-up general elections, democratic governments of various banners were produced by secret ballot, and eleven representatives (two female representatives) were elected. When the Chahar Mongolian People's Representatives Congress grandly opened in Zhangjiakou, Presidium member Suo Tena Mu Que Wei delivered a speech stating: \"For more than thirty years, the people of the Chahar League have suffered greatly under the oppression of Han chauvinism and feudal rule.

    "content": "【Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 17th】 The laboring people of Changchun City are launching an emancipation movement. Since the establishment of the democratic government, the city has been divided into eight administrative districts: Fushima, Changchun, Dongrong, Heshun, Kuancheng, Shuntian, and Datong, and eight work teams have been organized to carry out work. On April 30, citizens of the Jilin sub-district of the Heshun district first reasoned and settled accounts with nine distribution stores, including Dezengsheng and Juxingtai, and calculated a total of over 2 million yuan in embezzled cash. On May 1, citizens of the Balibao sub-district of the Dongrong district held a meeting to distribute enemy and puppet lands, estimating that each person would receive at least one to two mu of land. On May 7, citizens of the Yoshino sub-district of the Fushima district, after public discussion, distributed 29 houses of the enemy to 29 families. Citizens residing in the city, and workers in various factories, are also actively engaged in liquidation. The Changchun Tobacco Company calculated a total of 50 large boxes of cigarettes, worth 650,000 yuan, which were all handed over to the workers. All workers of the Changchun Transportation Company raised 42 cases of corruption by the past \"Labor Union Director\" Dai E'dian and others, and 17 liquidation committee members have now been selected to carry out the work.\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Huai'an, 8th】 In the past month and a half, the 5th sub-district of the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region has universally launched a movement to punish traitors and combat evil landlords, and reduce rent and interest. Over 400,000 people enthusiastically participated. In the Jiangtai district of Huai'an, over 10,000 people were involved in just 20 days. Thirty-nine traitors were punished one after another, and fourteen heads of evil landlords and bandits, as well as some illegal and stubborn landlords and usurers, were liquidated. The pseudo-bandit Ji Ni Peiying, Shi Ni Xianyuan (puppet Hai'an Zhao Ni Shaozhai's department's quartermaster, lurking in our liberated area, attempting to riot), Sun Ni Kaiqing, and the evil landlord Shen Lanting, etc., were all publicly tried by the people, and punishments such as capital punishment, imprisonment, self-renewal, and compensation for losses were imposed according to the severity of their crimes. The mass movement has its own characteristics in the new and old liberated areas. After launching the movement to punish traitors in the new liberated areas, it promptly shifted to reducing rent and interest. For example, in the Fengjian district of Huai'an, after the initial completion of the work of punishing traitors on April 5, a rent reduction rally was held on the 11th with more than 3,000 tenant farmers. The method of launching the movement in the old liberated areas is to use existing organizations to cultivate activists on a large scale, create typical examples, and promote the overall situation. For example, the Bingzheng district of Jianyang mobilized the masses and began by holding a four-day district-wide meeting of more than 500 peasant households. After clarifying the idea of \"who feeds whom,\" the masses' awareness was raised. After launching a struggle against Gu Jiashan, a landlord who did not reduce rent, it promoted the mass movement in the entire region.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n长春市\tChangchun Shi\n敷岛区\tFushima Qu\n长春区\tChangchun Qu\n东荣区\tDongrong Qu\n和顺区\tHeshun Qu\n宽城区\tKuancheng Qu\n顺天区\tShuntian Qu\n大同区\tDatong Qu\n德增盛\tDezengsheng\n聚兴泰\tJuxingtai\n吉林分区\tJilin Fenqu\n八里堡分区\tBalibao Fenqu\n吉野分区\tYoshino Fenqu\n戴峨典\tDai E'dian\n苏皖边区\tSu-Wan Bianqu\n淮安\tHuai'an\n蒋台区\tJiangtai Qu\n稽逆培瑛\tJi Ni Peiying\n施逆先元\tShi Ni Xianyuan\n赵逆少斋\tZhao Ni Shaozhai\n孙逆开庆\tSun Ni Kaiqing\n沈兰亭\tShen Lanting\n冯间区\tFengjian Qu\n建阳\tJianyang\n秉整区\tBingzheng Qu\n顾甲山\tGu Jiashan\n工会主任\tGonghui Zhuren (Labor Union Director)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 长春市掀起翻身运动  苏皖边区四十万人反奸减租\n\n1946-05-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　长春市掀起翻身运动\n    苏皖边区四十万人反奸减租\n    【新华社长春十七日电】长春市劳动人民，正掀起翻身运动。自民主政府成立后，即将全市划为敷岛、长春、东荣、和顺、宽城、顺天、大同等八个行政区，并组织八个工作队，进行工作。四月三十日，和顺区吉林分区市民，首先向德增盛、聚兴泰等九家配给店讲理算账，共算出贪污现金贰百余万元。五月一日，东荣区八里堡分区市民，举行分配敌伪土地大会，估计每人至少可分得一亩至二亩土地。五月七日，敷岛区吉野分区市民，经过公议，将敌人二十九间房屋分配给二十九家。市民居住市内，各工厂工人亦积极进行清算。长春烟草公司共清算出香烟五十大箱，价值六十五万元，全部交给工人。长春交通公司全体工人，提出过去“工会主任”戴峨典等贪污案件四十二件，现已选出清算委员十七名，进行工作。\n    【新华社淮安八日电】苏皖边区五分区一个半月以来，普遍的展开了惩奸反恶霸减租减息运动，四十余万人热烈参加，淮安蒋台区廿天中，即有一万余群众卷入。先后惩办汉奸三十九名，清算恶霸土匪头子十四名，以及非法顽固地主高利贷者等若干名。伪匪稽逆培瑛、施逆先元（伪海安赵逆少斋部军需，潜伏在我解放区，企图暴动）孙逆开庆、恶霸沈兰亭等，均经人民公审，按罪恶轻重，加以极刑、徒刑、自新、赔偿损失等处分。群众运动在新老解放区，各有特点，在新解放区展开惩奸运动后，及时转入减租减息。如淮安冯间区，在四月五日惩奸工作初步结束后，十一日即召开三千多佃户的退租齐心大会。在老解放区展开运动的方法，是运用已有组织，大规模培养积极分子、创造典型，推动全盘。如建阳秉整区发动群众，开始即开四天全区五百多个农佃户大会，弄通了“谁养活谁”思想之后，群众觉悟性提高了，经展开对不减租的地主顾甲山的斗争，推动了整个地区的群众运动。"

    "content": "Central News Agency Spreads Rumors with Ulterior Motives\n    Conspiring to Cover Up the Crime of Flooding Our Area\n    Border Region Government Spokesperson Sternly Refutes\n\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan News] According to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Kaifeng, \"Communist army representative Zhao Mingfu and others came to Bian on the 6th, and suddenly expressed opposition to the 'blocking the breach and restoring the embankment, taking into account both, and complementing each other' agreement reached by both sides last month, demanding 'restore the embankment first and then block the breach.' It was also stated: 'Xue Dubi of the Executive Yuan inspected and supervised the emergency repairs at Huayuankou, and instructed that the breach-blocking project should drive piles and throw stones in May, section by section, and the downstream embankment restoration project should also be promoted at the same time. However, the Yellow River embankment is 1,488 li long, of which three-quarters are in the Communist area, and are currently being negotiated with the Communist side to promote progress.'\" Regarding this, the reporter specifically visited the spokesperson of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government, who responded as follows:\n\n    (1) The agency stated that \"the Yellow River embankment is 1,488 li long, of which three-quarters are in the Communist area,\" which is 1,000 li, while the breach-blocking project is only 1,600 meters. Moreover, the Kuomintang has already secretly started construction and completed more than 1,000 meters. Now there are only 400 meters left, and it has been decided to drive piles and throw stones at the end of the month. Comparing this to the downstream 1,000 li dredging and embankment restoration, relocation and relief projects, can these be completed by the end of the month? The two are as different as heaven and earth and cannot be compared at all. Moreover, there are difficulties such as relocating residents and arranging relief. How can we \"take into account both, and complement each other?\"\n\n    (2) The Heze Agreement clearly stated in the first article: \"A. After the embankment restoration and river restoration, cutting off bends and straightening the river, and consolidating dangerous sections are completed, the river will be closed and water released.\" The Kaifeng Agreement clearly stipulates: \"The downstream will first measure the riverbed before the spring wheat harvest, then cut off bends, straighten the river, and dredge the river in the autumn, repair dangerous sections next spring, and finally close the river and release water.\" It is written clearly and distinctly, so who is the one who \"suddenly expressed opposition?\"\n\n    (3) The Kuomintang reactionaries, despite repeatedly claiming to be \"negotiating to promote progress,\" isn't it \"Xue Dubi of the Executive Yuan inspecting and supervising the emergency repairs at Huayuankou, and instructing that the breach-blocking project should drive piles and throw stones in May?\" What great \"negotiating to promote progress!\" Negotiating \"to promote progress\" with whom? Although we are very welcome, can the Central News Agency point out anyone who is \"currently negotiating with the Communist side to promote progress?\"\n\n    The truth is this: now the Kuomintang reactionaries have overturned both the Heze Agreement and the Kaifeng Agreement, which were established after several \"negotiations to promote progress.\" They don't even care about \"measuring the riverbed,\" and are only \"supervising emergency repairs\" at Huayuankou, \"limiting the driving of piles and throwing stones within May,\" blocking the breach and releasing water, destroying the liberated areas, and then blaming us for the crime of passive inaction and \"promoting\" ineffectively, to show that our people in the liberated areas deserve to die, and that it is their own fault, and has nothing to do with the Kuomintang reactionaries. This is the ghastly face behind the mask.

Merchants from Henan, Shandong, Suiyuan, and beyond the Great Wall are arriving in droves. Vehicles and ships transporting goods on both land and water are constantly bustling. Anguo, a well-known distribution center for medicinal materials, has seen 109 pharmacies resume business. Electric light factories, automobile transportation companies, post offices, etc., are all in the process of being established in the city. The Xinji large leather goods market has also been revitalized. There are currently 65 leather and fur trading firms, and 54 leather factories and workshops have also resumed operations. The daily market supply of cattle and sheep hides reaches more than 4,000 pieces. In order to invigorate the market's finance and facilitate commercial remittances, privately-owned banks have been established in Anguo and Xinji. In Mozhou, a commercial hub forty li north of Renqiu, nearly 20 business firms from Tianjin and Beiping have recently moved here to operate. The Mozhou market can trade over 2,000 dan of grain and over 21,000 bolts of native cloth. Every day, a large amount of grain and native cloth from various parts of Hebei-Central are transported to the Kuomintang-controlled areas to alleviate the urgent needs of the people. Every day, over 30 large carts of grain and native cloth are transported from Xinji to Shijiazhuang, and over 10 large carts of medicinal materials are transported from Anguo to Tianjin every day.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 10th] The number of commercial firms in Zhangjiakou City has now grown to 2,716, and the number of small vendors has grown from over 1,000 to over 10,000. The daily trade volume of the Zhishan Street small commodities market reaches over 20 million yuan. The Zhangjiakou markets for fur, grain, and livestock, which were famous in North China before the war, are all rapidly recovering. Due to the smooth transportation between the border areas and the interior, and the rising living standards of farmers, there is an urgent need for a large number of daily necessities. As a result, the grain market is unprecedentedly active, with the highest daily trading volume reaching over 7,000 dan, and the average being around 2,500 dan. There are now 248 fur firms that have reopened, and each market sees over 1,000 heads of livestock. The area near Zhangjiakou is rich in produce. Wheat production in Chahar Province is over 70,000 tons per year. Each league and banner can export 2.1 million jin of camel and sheep wool annually, 840,000 jin of camel and sheep down, and 200,000 dan of pond salt and earth salt. In addition, livestock, cattle and sheep hides, medicinal materials, and pigs are also major exports. In the future, under the democratic government's effective measures to develop industry and commerce, Zhangjiakou's commerce will surely become increasingly prosperous.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n安国  Anguo\n辛集  Xinji\n河南  Henan\n山东  Shandong\n绥远  Suiyuan\n河间  Hejian\n任邱  Renqiu\n鄚州  Mozhou\n平津  Beiping Tianjin (referring to the combined area)\n石家庄  Shijiazhuang\n天津  Tianjin\n张家口  Zhangjiakou\n至善街  Zhishan Street\n察省  Chahar Province\n丹  dan (unit of dry measure, approximately 50 kg)\n斤  jin (unit of weight, approximately 500g)\n里  li (unit of distance, approximately 500 meters)\n大车  large carts\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n国民党  Kuomintang\n冀中  Hebei-Central\n北四十里  Forty li north\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 关内外客商接踵而至  冀中市场日益繁荣  张垣每日贸易额二千万元\n\n1946-05-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　关内外客商接踵而至\n    冀中市场日益繁荣\n    张垣每日贸易额二千万元\n    【新华社河间十一日电】冀中主要工商业市场，日益繁荣，河南、山东、绥远、及关外的客商，接踵而至；水陆两路载运货物的车辆船只，终日络绎不绝。著名药材集散地安国，复业药铺，已有一百零九家。城内电灯厂、汽车运输公司、邮政局等，均在筹建中。辛集大皮货市场，亦已重新振兴。现有皮毛商行六十五家，复业的制革厂作坊等，亦有五十四家，每日上市的牛羊皮，共达四千余张。为活跃市面金融，便利商业汇兑，安国、辛集均已建立私营银号。任邱北四十里之商业重镇鄚州，近有平津商号二十余户，移此营业。鄚州大集，可上市粮食二千余石，土布二万一千余匹。冀中各地，每日有大量粮食土布运往国民党统治区，解救人民急需。辛集每日运往石家庄的粮食、土布三十余大车、安国每日亦有十余辆大车的药材运往天津。\n    【新华社张家口十日电】张市各业商行现已发展至二千七百一十六户，小商贩由千余户发展到一万多户。至善街小商市场，每日贸易额达二千余万元，战前闻名华北的张家口皮毛、粮食、牲畜等市场，均在迅速恢复中。由于边区内地交通畅通，农民生活上升，亟需大量日常用品，因之粮食市场空前活跃，每日上市额最高达七千余石，平均亦在二千五百石左右。皮毛行现已有二百四十八户重新开张，每集登集牲畜达千余头。张市附近，出产丰饶，察省小麦，年产七万余吨。各盟旗每年可输出驼羊毛二百一十万斤，驼羊绒八十四万斤，池盐土盐二十万担。此外牲畜、牛羊皮、药材、猪，也都是大宗输出品，今后在民主政府努力发展工商业的良好措施下，张市商业，定必日益繁荣。"

Their land rights have been confirmed, and land certificates have been issued. In the Taijian District of Jilin City, more than 200 hectares of paddy and dry land confiscated from the puppet \"Minsheng\" and \"Zhenxing\" cooperatives have been allocated to 40 poor peasant households, benefiting 392 people, with 257 of them receiving three mu each. Thirty-five hectares of land belonging to Wang Yiqing, a notorious Japanese special agent in Jilin, have been distributed to 25 landless peasant households. The 273 houses have also been distributed to poor people for residence. In Tonghua County, during rent reduction, the Farmers' Association, based on a standard of three mu of vegetable land or six mu of paddy field per laborer, distributed land seized by the enemy to landless poor people throughout the street. Celebrating their liberation, they enthusiastically joined the Farmers' Association. In Zhen'an Village, Chengfeng County, Liaobei Province, 29,743 mu of enemy and puppet land were distributed to 998 households, comprising 4,774 landless or land-poor individuals, averaging slightly more than six mu and two fen per person. This ensures that a family of three or four can secure food and clothing as long as they cultivate diligently. After the land distribution, significant changes have occurred in the class composition of the village. Originally, hired laborers accounted for 35 percent and poor tenant farmers for 60 percent; now, they have all become self-cultivating farmers.

Later, the bandit surrendered to Zhang Ziming, the commander of the puppet army (Jining) Wen (shang) Dong (ping) Bandit Suppression, and served as the deputy commander of bandit suppression. After the enemy surrendered, Jining was liberated by us. The Kuomintang appointed the bandit as the Commissioner of the Lusi District and Commander of Bandit Suppression, and sent Kuomintang agent Zhang Guangfu as his secretary. In February, Bai Guanchang, the bandit's chief of staff, led more than thirty armed men to Jinan to contact the Kuomintang. Due to the Kuomintang's support and instructions, they expanded the bandit gang to more than two thousand people and actively invaded the liberated areas. On March 10th, they raided Shilizha and Wulipu areas in our Nanwang County, killing more than ten village cadres and agricultural association cadres, and assassinating a working member of the Second District of Wenshang. After our encirclement and suppression, it is reported that the bandit has fled to Jinan. The lower-level soldiers have surrendered to the democratic government one after another. Only a remnant of his troops are hiding in groups and continuing secret activities. The lake water has now been diverted by us into the Grand Canal, and most of the land has been transformed into fertile fields. The masses in the villages within the lake have now largely established their own organizations, defending themselves while producing.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n人物 People:\n\n何思源  He Siyuan\n白先恩  Bai Xianen\n刘本相  Liu Benxiang\n张子明  Zhang Ziming\n陈德三  Chen Desan\n张广福  Zhang Guangfu\n白关昌  Bai Guanchang\n\n地点 Places:\n\n荷泽  Heze\n二分区  Second Sub-district\n蜀山湖  Shushan Lake\n邓城  Dengcheng\n济宁  Jining\n汶上  Wenshang\n东平  Dongping\n鲁西区  Lusi District\n济南  Jinan\n南旺县  Nanwang County\n十里闸  Shilizha\n五里铺  Wulipu\n运河  Grand Canal\n\n组织机构 Organizations:\n\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n国民党  Kuomintang\n农会  Agricultural Association\n中共  Chinese Communist Party\n民主政府  Democratic Government\n\n其他 Other:\n\n伪军  Puppet army\n剿匪司令  Bandit Suppression Commander\n鲁西区专员兼剿匪司令  Commissioner of the Lusi District and Commander of Bandit Suppression\n中华民国  Republic of China\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党豢养伪匪扰乱解放区  惯匪陈德三部被肃清  蜀山湖变为良田人民生产自卫\n\n1946-05-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党豢养伪匪扰乱解放区\n    惯匪陈德三部被肃清\n    蜀山湖变为良田人民生产自卫\n    【新华社荷泽讯】在国党支撑下盘踞于我二分区蜀山湖一带之惯匪陈德三部十余股，共六百余人，现已被我解除武装。共缴轻机枪三挺、掷弹筒两个、长短枪八十余支。陈匪于民国三十三年开始组织土匪时，仅二、三十人，当时何思源即派其特务白先恩打入，掌握该匪，并与当时邓城伪县长刘本相勾结，借敌伪势力，扩大组织，压榨群众，将蜀山湖变为匪区。该匪后投降伪军（济宁）汶（上）东（平）剿匪司令张子明，任剿匪副司令。敌人投降后，济宁被我解放，国民党委该匪为鲁西区专员兼剿匪司令，并派国特张广福任其秘书。二月间，该匪股长白关昌，曾带武装三十余赴济南与国民党联络，因受国民党之支撑与指令，扩展匪众二千余，积极进犯解放区。三月十日，曾到我南旺县十里闸、五里铺一带抢掠，杀死各村农会干部及村干部十余人，暗杀汶上二区工作员一人。经我围剿，闻该匪已逃至济南，其下层士兵，纷纷向民主政府自首，仅其残余一部，分组隐蔽，继续秘密活动。该湖水现已被我引入运河，大部土地变为良田。现湖内村庄群众，已大部成立了自己的组织，一面自卫，一面生产。"

    "content": "[This Newspaper, Handan, 17th Dispatch] The Yongnian group's trip to Yongnian this time, our representative earnestly hoped to immediately resolve the issue of the surrender of the puppet troops in Yongnian according to the troop reorganization plan, to benefit the people. However, as soon as the group arrived at its destination, a serious divergence occurred regarding the issue of the group's station, causing the Yongnian surrender issue to remain at a standstill. This reporter specifically visited Colonel Zhao Haifeng, the CCP representative of the Yongnian group, in Nanqiao Town outside Yongnian City, and was informed as follows: \"When the three parties' representatives of the Yongnian group departed from Handan for Yongnian on the 15th, they discussed the issue of the group's station. Our side believed that the group's station should be located in the liberated area outside the city, not in the county seat occupied by the puppet troops. This proposal was purely to maintain national integrity and dignity. Unexpectedly, after the Yongnian group arrived in Yongnian, the Guomindang representative and the US representative avoided discussing the surrender issue and insisted on moving into the city. In order to maintain national dignity, our side remained stationed outside the city and sent a letter to the Guomindang and US representatives on the 16th, requesting a prompt resolution to the station issue, and explaining that the 250,000 people in Yongnian County, originally only 20,000 in the city, were unable to live due to the puppet troops' cruel exploitation and extortion, and many had moved to our liberated area for relief and resettlement. Currently, there are only 3,000 people left in the city, and the rest are all puppet troops and their families. Based on the number of people, the group's station should also be in the liberated area. In addition, the puppet troops in the city claimed that they would execute our personnel, repeatedly threatened and insulted our liaison personnel, and continuously fired at our side, making it impossible to carry out work. Now I have telegraphed the Beiping Executive Headquarters to quickly resolve this issue, so that the work of the Yongnian group can proceed smoothly.\"\n    [Handan, 17th Dispatch] After the Guomindang and US representatives of the Yongnian group entered Yongnian City on the afternoon of the 15th, the puppet troops in Yongnian immediately became rampant and suddenly began to fiercely fire on our defense lines at 9 o'clock the next day. Comrade Chen Fu, a platoon leader who went to the city on official business, was seriously wounded. Our army had no choice but to use machine guns for cover to pull the wounded back. The puppet troops continued to fire until 12 o'clock. It is also learned that Comrade Kang Kai, a liaison officer sent by our side to Yongnian City to contact the US and Guomindang representatives, was subjected to all kinds of threats and insults by the puppet troops when he passed through the East Gate on the 16th, claiming: \"Now we have backers, you don't know what's good for you, we will execute you!\" Upon learning this, our representative Colonel Zhao Haifeng immediately lodged a serious protest with the US and Guomindang representatives.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\nPeople:\n赵海枫  Zhao Haifeng\n陈辅  Chen Fu\n康凯  Kang Kai\n\nPlaces:\n邯郸  Handan\n永年  Yongnian\n南桥镇  Nanqiao Zhen\n永年城  Yongnian Cheng\n东门  Dongmen\n北平  Beiping\n\nOrganizations:\n中国共产党  Chinese Communist Party (CCP)\n国民党  Guomindang\n永年小组  Yongnian Group\n北平执行部  Beiping Executive Headquarters\n\nEvents:\n整军方案 troop reorganization plan\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国美两方代表避谈受降问题  永年伪军猖狂益甚  保持民族尊严我代表坚主驻地应在解放区  城内伪军竟仗势猛烈射击我防地\n\n1946-05-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国美两方代表避谈受降问题\n    永年伪军猖狂益甚\n    保持民族尊严我代表坚主驻地应在解放区\n    城内伪军竟仗势猛烈射击我防地\n    【本报邯郸十七日讯】永年小组此次赴永，我方代表热诚希望能根据整军方案，立即解决永年伪军的受降问题，以造福人民，乃小组甫抵目的地，即因小组驻地问题发生严重分歧，以致永年受降问题仍处于停顿状态。记者特趋访永年小组中共代表赵海枫上校于永年城外之南桥镇，承告以如下：“永年小组三方代表于十五日由邯赴永时，曾商讨小组驻地问题，我方以小组驻地宜设于城外解放区，不宜设于伪军盘踞的县城，此项提议，乃纯为保持民族气节与尊严，不意永年小组抵永后，国方代表与美方代表竟对受降问题避而不谈，坚持要移驻城内，我方为维持民族之尊严，仍留驻城外，并于十六日致函国方与美方代表要求迅速解决驻地问题，并说明永年全县二十五万人，城内原不过两万，经伪军之残酷压榨勒索无法生活，而迁入我解放区获得救济与安置者甚多，目前城内人民已不过三千，其余全为伪军伪属，依人民多寡，小组驻地亦应在解放区。加以城内伪军声称：要枪毙我方人员，屡次威胁辱骂我方联络人员，并不断向我方射击，已无法进行工作。现我已电请北平执行部迅速解决此问题，以便永年小组工作顺利进行。\n    【邯郸十七日电】永年小组国方代表与美方代表十五日下午进入永年城后，永年伪军立刻猖狂起来，突于翌日九点起开始向我防地猛烈射击，我因公赴城内的排长陈辅同志被击负重伤，我军不得已，以机枪掩护，始将伤号拉回。伪军一直射击至十二时始止。另悉：我方派赴永年城与美方及国方代表联络的联络员康凯同志于十六日出城经过东门时，曾备受伪军百般威胁辱骂，声称：“现在我们有了靠山，你们不识时务，就要枪毙你们！”我方代表赵海枫上校获悉，立刻向美方与国方代表提出严重抗议。"

    "content": "Balanced Rainfall in Mountains and Plains\n    Border Region Overflowing with Bumper Harvest Scene\n    Wheat Yellowing Discovered in Some Areas, Harvest May Be Slightly Reduced\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan] Since the beginning of spring, rainfall has been evenly distributed in various areas, allowing for timely summer harvesting and planting. A bumper harvest scene, unseen since the War of Resistance, is spread across the smiling faces of 30 million farmers in the entire region. In the Taiyue Liberated Area, there have been four thorough rains since the spring plowing. The 50 million mu of wheat seedlings in the entire area are growing exceptionally robustly, with very full ears. If there are no storms or disasters in the future, a full ten percent wheat harvest is expected. The Handan Plain, the capital of Hebei’s southern Hebei region, and Weixian, Nangong, and Linqing counties in the central area of southern Hebei, will also have a more abundant summer harvest than any year since the War of Resistance due to sufficient spring and summer rainfall. According to experienced farmers, even if it doesn't rain in the future, a good harvest is still possible. Superior land can yield at least one shi per mu, medium land can yield six dou, and on average, at least eight big dou per mu can be harvested. Starting from Handan and driving south along Cheng'an and Daming into the southern and eastern plains of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, including Nanle, Qingfeng, Puyang, Juye, and Jiaxiang counties, as well as the Jining Plain, known as the \"Granary of North China,\" the vast fields are completely covered by vigorous summer wheat. This year's harvest in this area should be even greater than in the Handan Plain. Therefore, in the old and new liberated areas of Taihang in the mountains, this year's wheat harvest will also exceed any year during the war due to favorable rainfall. In counties such as Changzhi, Lucheng, Huguan, Licheng, Xiangyuan, and Pingshun in that region, where the wheat planting area was not large in previous years, the wheat planting area rapidly expanded to 30% of the cultivated land area last year under the active help and leadership of the democratic government. The vigor of this year's wheat seedlings is unprecedented in the past 30 years, and it is estimated that each mu of wheat can yield one shi and six dou. However, wheat yellowing has now begun to be discovered in some areas, and the harvest may be somewhat affected. Excited emotions are encouraging farmers to actively plant and prepare for the second bumper harvest. Over 1.5 million mu of cotton have been planted in Taihang. In the second district of Qin County in Taiyue, over 5,000 mu of cotton have already been planted, and over 2,100 mu of Golden Queen have been promoted. Summer planting has also been widely carried out in areas such as southern Hebei and Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and autumn seedlings have emerged in time.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    China\n邯郸    Handan\n太岳解放区    Taiyue Liberated Area\n河北    Hebei\n冀南    Southern Hebei\n威县    Weixian\n南宫    Nangong\n临清    Linqing\n冀鲁豫    Hebei-Shandong-Henan\n成安    Cheng'an\n大名    Daming\n南乐    Nanle\n清丰    Qingfeng\n濮阳    Puyang\n巨野    Juye\n嘉祥    Jiaxiang\n济宁平原    Jining Plain\n华北谷仓    Granary of North China\n太行    Taihang\n长治    Changzhi\n潞城    Lucheng\n壶关    Huguan\n黎城    Licheng\n襄垣    Xiangyuan\n平顺    Pingshun\n沁县    Qin County\n金皇后   Golden Queen\n新华社   Xinhua News Agency\n石  Shi (a unit of dry volume, about 10 pecks)\n亩 Mu (unit of area equal to 1/6 acre)\n斗 Dou (unit of dry volume, about 1 peck)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 山地平原雨水调匀  边区洋溢丰年景象  若干地区小麦发现黄疸，收成可能稍减\n\n1946-05-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　山地平原雨水调匀\n    边区洋溢丰年景象\n    若干地区小麦发现黄疸，收成可能稍减\n    【新华社邯郸讯】入春以来，各地雨水调匀，夏收夏种均可适时进行，抗战以来从所未有的丰年景象，洋溢在全区三千万农民的笑脸上，太岳解放区，自春耕以来，已普落透雨四次。全区五千万亩麦苗，长得特别茁壮，出穗甚为饱满。今后如无风暴灾害，麦收可望十成、河北冀南首府的邯郸平原，及冀南中心区的威县、南宫、临清等县，也因春夏雨水充足，夏收当比抗战以来任何一年丰裕。据有经验的农民谈：今后如不下雨，麦子亦可丰收，上等好地每亩最少可打一石，中等地可收六斗，平均每亩至少可收八大斗。由邯郸出发驱车南行，沿成安大名驶入冀鲁豫平原东之南乐、清丰、濮阳、巨野、嘉祥等县，以及素称“华北谷仓”的济宁平原时，广阔的田野，已全为旺盛的夏麦所遮盖。今年这一地区的收成，更当甚于邯郸平原。因之在山地的太行新老解放区，今年的麦收，也因雨水调顺，产量将超过战争期间任何一年。该区长治、潞城、壶关、黎城、襄垣、平顺等县，往年种麦面积不大，去年在民主政府积极帮助领导下，种麦面积，即飞速扩展至耕地面积百分之三十，今年麦苗的茂盛，已为三十年来所未有，预计每亩麦收可打一石六斗。但若干地区小麦现开始发现黄疸，收成可能受若干影响。兴奋的情绪，正鼓舞着农民们积极下种，准备第二个丰收。太行已种棉一百五十余万亩，太岳沁县二区，即已种棉五千余亩，推种金皇后两千一百余亩，冀南、冀鲁豫等区，夏种亦已普遍进行，现秋苗已适时出土。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-05-21",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Paris Foreign Ministers Conference\n\n　　The Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference, which opened in Paris on April 25th and lasted for three weeks, adjourned on May 16th and decided to reconvene on June 15th to continue consultations on outstanding issues. The purpose of this Foreign Ministers Conference was to expedite the drafting of peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, former satellites of Germany, in preparation for submission to the future 21-nation peace conference. After 26 plenary or secret meetings, preliminary and partial agreements were reached, including the preamble to the Italian peace treaty, the disposition of the Italian navy, the disposition of some islands in the Adriatic Sea, and parts of the treaties with Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. However, agreement was not reached on several issues. The sticking point of the conference was the following important issues in the Italian peace treaty:\n\n　　First, the issue of reparations. The Soviet Union demanded $300 million in reparations, of which $100 million would go to the Soviet Union and $200 million would be distributed to Yugoslavia, Greece, and Albania. Considering the losses suffered by these countries from the Axis member Italy in World War II, the Soviet demand was not large. However, the United States and Britain initially refused. After France's compromise, they recognized the reparation of $100 million to the Soviet Union, but raised objections to the source of the reparations. Byrnes confused relief and reparations responsibilities, saying that Italy was too poor and needed large amounts of American relief and aid. Second, on the issue of the disposition of Italian colonies, the Soviet Union made the most significant concessions. It finally abandoned its individual trusteeship claim over Tripolitania, agreed to France's proposal, and agreed in principle to Britain's plan to return the Dodecanese Islands to Greece, abandoning its demand to establish a base on the islands. Britain also partially accepted France's proposal in the end, but the United States preferred an international condominium policy, advocating that the four powers jointly administer the Italian colonies in North Africa for one year. If a final solution could not be found within this year, the area would be handed over to the United Nations for handling. This plan was rejected by Bevin. Third, the Trieste issue is generally considered to be the key issue in the Italian peace treaty and the most fiercely debated. The Soviet Union supported Yugoslavia's reasonable demand to merge the city, because the area should be returned to Yugoslavia in terms of history, economy, and politics. The United States and Britain insisted on separating the city from its historical and economic mother body, Venezia Giulia, and continuing to assign it to Italy. The US-UK plan not only encourages the Italian reactionaries to admit that their past plunder continues to be legal, and thereby \"punishes the new democratic Yugoslavia,\" but also has \"ulterior motives\" (Molotov's words), which is to adhere to the Mediterranean balance of power policy, imprison the Soviet Union in the inland sea, and prevent it from entering the Mediterranean, because in their view, Yugoslavia is undoubtedly pro-Soviet. Second, and more importantly, if Trieste remains with Italy, the US-UK controlled Italy will undoubtedly use the area as a base for the US and Britain to penetrate the Balkans in the future. This is the secret behind the UK and US's consistent disregard for Yugoslavia's demands. This consistency between the US and the UK, and their inconsistency on the issue of Italian colonies in North Africa, exposes the fact that the United States supports Britain in excluding the Soviet Union from the Mediterranean, while at the same time trying to find more opportunities to extend its influence into the British Empire's sphere of influence. Fourth, on the issue of the form of control over Italy, Byrnes insisted on expanding the control power over Italy, enabling it to generally supervise the implementation of the treaty clauses. The expansion of the power of the Italian Control Commission means the expansion of the power of the US and UK, which further undermines Italy's sovereignty and prevents the growth of Italy's democratic forces. According to a Reuters report by Mr. King on May 1, the United States' plan also contained the attempt that if it was accepted, it could be used as a precedent for Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria to expand its reach into the Balkans. The Soviet Union, of course, opposed this plan and insisted that Italy should be granted an independent and autonomous democratic position. Fifth, on the issue of the date of the peace conference, according to a United Press dispatch: Byrnes anticipated that \"at least fifteen or sixteen countries at the 21-nation peace conference are almost certain to side with the Western countries. Therefore, he repeatedly requested that the unresolved issues at the conference be submitted to the peace conference for discussion.\" This proposal clearly violated the agreements of the Potsdam and Moscow conferences (i.e., the draft peace treaty submitted to the peace conference for approval must first obtain the unanimous consent of the four powers).\n\n　　Looking at this Paris Conference, several points are worth noting: First, the main disputes in the conference occurred between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the United States took different views on the Soviet Union on almost every important issue; Second, there were also differences between the United States and Britain, especially on the issue of Italian colonies. The Soviet Union made important concessions on this issue, mainly to Britain. Third, although this conference did not achieve major results, the atmosphere was eased and there was room for negotiation. From the above three points, this conference is different from the London Three Foreign Ministers Conference in September last year.\n\n　　The third post-war Foreign Ministers Conference, although without major results, has adjourned temporarily, but no matter how many disputes and twists and turns there may be, the issues raised in the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference will eventually be resolved through compromise.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n意大利   Italy\n罗马尼亚  Romania\n保加利亚  Bulgaria\n匈牙利   Hungary\n芬兰  Finland\n德国   Germany\n的黎波里坦尼亚  Tripolitania\n多得喀尼斯群岛  Dodecanese Islands\n希腊   Greece\n的里雅斯特  Trieste\n南斯拉夫  Yugoslavia\n朱利亚  Venezia Giulia\n贝纳斯  Byrnes\n贝文  Bevin\n莫洛托夫  Molotov\n波茨顿  Potsdam\n莫斯科  Moscow\n金氏  King\n合众社  United Press\n路透社  Reuters\n巴黎外长会议   Paris Foreign Ministers Conference\n伦敦三外长会议   London Three Foreign Ministers Conference\n联合国   United Nations\n第二次世界大战  World War II\n轴心国成员  Axis member\n四强  Four Powers\n苏联  Soviet Union\n美国  United States\n英国  Britain\n法国  France\n阿尔巴尼亚  Albania\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 巴黎外长会议\n\n1946-05-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　巴黎外长会议\n    四月二十五日，在巴黎召开的四强外长会议，历时三周，已于五月十六日宣告休会了，并决定于六月十五日再行召开，以便继续协商各项未决问题。这次外长会议的目的，是为了加速草就对德前附庸国意、罗、保、匈、芬等国的和约，以准备提交未来的二十一国和会会议，经过二十六次的全会或秘密会议之后，包括对意和约序言，对意海军之处置，亚得里亚海之一些岛屿的处置，对罗、匈、保、芬和约之部分问题等，已达到了初步的部份的原则的协定，但在若干问题上，仍未获得协议。会议僵持的焦点，是关于对意和约中如下的一些重要问题：\n    第一，赔款问题，苏联要求三亿美元的赔偿，其中一亿归苏，二亿分配于南、希、与阿尔巴尼亚，由轴心成员意大利在二次世界大战中所给予上述国家的损失来说，苏联这个要求是不大的，但是美英初则拒绝，复经法国之折衷，承认予苏一亿美元之赔款，而关于赔款来源问题，又作异议，贝纳斯把救济与赔偿责任混为一谈，说意大利穷因不堪，需要美国大量之救济和援助。第二，苏联在意大利殖民地之处置这个问题上，作了最重大的让步，它最后放弃了对的黎波里坦尼亚的单独托管要求，而同意了法国的建议，并在原则上同意了英国将多得喀尼斯群岛归还希腊的计划，而放弃了它在该岛建立基地的要求。英国在最后也部分接受了法国的建议，但美国则宁愿国际共管政策，主张北非意殖民地由四强托管一年，如在此一年中不能求得最后解决办法，则将该地交给联合国处理，这个计划遭到贝文的拒绝。第三，的里雅斯特问题，一般认为这是对意和约的关键问题，而且是争论最烈的一个问题，苏联支持南斯拉夫合并的城的合理要求，因为该地不论从历史经济和政治各方面看，都应该归还给南国，而美英则坚持使的城与其历史的和经济的母体朱利亚区分割开来，仍然归属意国。美英的计划不仅是鼓励意国反动派承认其过去的掠夺继续合法，并以此“处罚新民主主义的南国”，而且还有“其不可告人的动机”（莫洛托夫语），这就是坚持地中海均势政策，囚禁苏联于内海，而使其无法进入地中海，因为在他们看来，南国无疑是亲苏的。其次，更重要的是如果的城保留给意国，在美英控制下的意国，无疑将以该地供作美英他日深入巴尔干的基地，这就是英美一致不顾一切，反对南国要求的秘密。美英这一点的一致，同他们在北非意殖民地问题上的不一致，暴露了一个事实，即美国支持英国排除苏联于地中海之外，同时则企图找寻更多的机会，将自己的势力伸进英帝国势力范围。第四，对意管制形式问题，贝纳斯坚持扩大对意的管制权力，使其能一般的监督和约条款的执行，意大利管制委员会权力的扩大，就是美英权力的扩大，就是更加损害意国的主权，和阻止意国民主力量的生长。据路透社记者金氏五月一日的报导，美国的上述计划，还包含这样的企图，即如其被接受，即可援例用之于罗、匈、保各国，以扩大其伸足巴尔干的机会。苏联当然反对这个计划，而坚持应予意国以独立自主的民主立场。第五，和会召开的日期问题，据合众社电讯称：贝纳斯预计到“二十一国和会上至少有十五六个国家几已确定附合西方诸国，因此，一再反复要求将会议上之未决问题，提交和会讨论”。这个提案，明显地破坏了波茨顿与莫斯科会议的协定（即提交和会批准之和约草案，必须首先取得四强一致之同意。）\n    综观这次巴黎会议，有几点值得注意：第一，会议中主要争执是发生于美苏之间，几乎在每一个重要问题上，美方都对苏联采取不同的意见；第二，美英之间也有分歧，特别表现在意大利殖民地问题上。苏联在这个问题上，作了重要的让步，主要是对英让步。第三，这次会议虽无重大成就，但气氛缓和，留有余地。从以上三点看来，这次会议是和去年九月间伦敦三外长会议不同的。\n    战后第三次的外长会议，虽无重大结果，而暂时休会了，但是不管经过多少争论和曲折，巴黎外长会议中所提出的问题，终究是要得到妥协的解决的。"

The team arrived at the site for investigation at 12:00 on the 14th, and found many bullet marks on Xibalizhuang and Zhidu villages coming from the Kuomintang military side. The U.S. representative then proved that the so-called conflict in early May was caused by the Kuomintang troops violating the agreement and occupying the two villages. The Kuomintang then falsely claimed that the two villages were occupied by them on January 16th, and the conflict in early May was caused by our army's attack. Our representative, Major General Huang Zhen, immediately took out the situation map presented by the Kuomintang to the executive group on February 18 for verification (our side and the U.S. side both had a copy). The map showed that Xibalizhuang and Zhidu were both in the CCP area. In addition, when the three representatives inspected, they saw with their own eyes that the Kuomintang troops were building bunkers in the two villages. This fully proves that the conflict west of Anyang in early May was entirely caused by the Kuomintang troops occupying the two villages, and the Kuomintang should bear full responsibility. Afterwards, our representative asked U.S. representative Colonel Hoddell for his opinion after the inspection. Hoddell replied: \"The Kuomintang army illegally occupied Xibalizhuang and Zhidu and must withdraw. If this agreement cannot be reached, I will submit my opinion to the Beiping Executive Headquarters!\" The next day, the team went to the conflict zone north of Anyang for inspection, and the results proved that the responsibility lies entirely with the Kuomintang and not with the Communist side. After obtaining sufficient true information, the team returned to Xinxiang on the 15th.\n    [Another dispatch] Yan Xishan fabricated that our army attacked Baicheng Town of Taigu on May 7th. After the Dongqin team went to Taigu for investigation, the truth came to light. The facts prove that it was not the Communist army attacking Baicheng Town, but Yan's army attacking our Pangcun. The Kuomintang representative still tried to deny this, but the U.S. and our representatives insisted on the facts, and the two sides argued endlessly.

Yesterday, five thousand people held a demonstration outside the Imperial Palace. The demonstrating masses proceeded in an orderly fashion to the outside of the Imperial Palace gate, demanding to see the Japanese Emperor. A delegation of twenty-five people requested the Emperor to dismiss Yoshida and share the Imperial household's grain and assets with the people. At another location outside the Imperial Palace, representatives of the Japan National Printing Workers' Union put forward the same demands, vowing to back them up with a general strike to stop printing Japanese Yen banknotes if their demands were not met. Meanwhile, while Yoshida was holding a secret meeting to discuss the issue of forming a cabinet, thousands of Japanese people, under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, gathered outside Yoshida's residence, denouncing Yoshida as a reactionary and shouting slogans protesting Yoshida's appointment as Prime Minister. Eleven demonstrators rushed into Yoshida's official residence, delivered a letter of protest, and demanded to meet with Shidehara and Yoshida, but were refused. The Japanese Communist Party has decided to hold a large demonstration of 200,000 people towards the Imperial Palace on the 19th, again protesting Yoshida's appointment as Prime Minister, and will expose more than fifty hidden grain storage locations in Tokyo. The Japanese police expressed deep concern about this. The Socialist Party has refused Yoshida's invitation to participate in the new cabinet. Socialist Party spokesperson Chotaro Mizutani (center-left) stated: Yoshida's cabinet is the illegitimate child of the soon-to-be-defunct Prime Minister Shidehara and Cabinet Secretary General Wataru Kusumoto. An editorial in the Asahi Shimbun criticized Yoshida's cabinet as the successor to the Shidehara cabinet, which is purely composed of reactionary bureaucrats, and is another line of defense for the bureaucrats who are about to step down. Yomiuri Hochi revealed that some members of the Progressive Party deeply feel that many old-school members are still maintaining their original positions in the new cabinet.

The bank's founding meeting opened on the 17th and closed on the 19th. More than 80 shareholders and many guests attended. On the first day, Mr. Wang Huafu, representing the preparatory committee, reported on the preparation process. Deputy Speaker Xing delivered a speech on the spot, hoping that Ruihua would \"serve the masses, unite with the masses, and develop itself.\" He also called on \"the business community to unite and prosper the market.\" On the second day, the \"Ruihua Bank Articles of Association\" were discussed and approved. On the third day, directors and supervisors were elected. Hu Zhuxuan, Jia Xingwu, Wang Huafu, Zhang Wenhua, and other thirteen people were elected as directors, and Zhang Ziyuan, Liu Zhuqiao, Yang Mingshi, and other five people were elected as supervisors. The directors then mutually elected Hu Zhuxuan as chairman.

The 55th Regiment of the puppet Zhang Lanfeng's force, which was cooperating with the Kuomintang army in \"encircling and suppressing\" our eastern Henan liberated area, invaded Zhuanjiaolou in Suixian County on the night of the 13th. The next night, it continued to attack a certain unit of our Eighth Route Army stationed in Chaozhuang, five miles north of the village. Our army was forced to defend itself and repelled them, killing or wounding over 60 puppet troops and seizing one light machine gun. On the same day, the First Detachment of our Suixian County Brigade recovered He Yangji in the southeast of Sui (county). More than 200 puppet troops of Zhang Xianlian's force in Changqing attacked the station of a certain regiment of ours in Sanzhuang, ten miles south of the city, at 8:00 a.m. on the 13th.

At the same time, more than 200 puppet troops of Li Lianxiang's force in Qihe went to Ao Jiajing to seize grain and were repelled by our Qihe Independent Battalion, which seized one small cannon.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Heze, 17th] A part of the Kuomintang 40th Army, cooperating with two regiments, the 4th and 5th, of the puppet Li Ying's force, totaling more than 2,000 people with seven cannons, launched an attack on the area west of the Nanhe River in the Fourth Military Subdistrict of Hebei-Shandong-Henan (Qixian, Tangyin, Neihuang, Huaxian, etc.) on the 12th. The puppet Li Ying's force has occupied Dougongji and Ma Taibao, more than ten miles northwest of our Chu Wangzhen (belonging to Neihuang County).

    "date": "1946-05-21",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Introduction to the Yudong Liberated Area\n    On April 10th, at the meeting of chiefs of staff between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in Xinxiang, Zhao Zili, Chief of Staff of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters and representative of the Kuomintang, blatantly lied, falsely claiming that \"there were no CCP troops in Yudong before January 13th,\" attempting to deny the existence of our Yudong Liberated Area as a pretext for launching a large-scale civil war. On May 8th, the Kuomintang again submitted a memorandum to the Xinxiang group, denying the existence of our Yudong Eighth Route Army before January 14th. This is part of the Kuomintang's warmongering elements' preparations to launch a civil war.\n    The Yudong Liberated Area originally included both the east (east of the new Yellow River) and west parts. As early as May 1938, during the Battle of Zhengzhou, the Japanese army launched a large-scale invasion of Yudong, and the Kuomintang army collapsed without a fight, fleeing at the first sign of trouble. Qixian, Suixian, Taikang, and other cities fell into enemy hands one after another. Chinese Communist Party members Wu Zhipu, Wang Jiepu, Wang Laiwen, and others, in conjunction with local anti-Japanese patriots, established the Third Detachment of the New Fourth Army for Anti-Japanese Resistance, fighting in the Suixian, Qixian, Tongxu, and Taikang areas, leading the people of Yudong to actively strike at the enemy and puppets, and creating the anti-Japanese guerrilla base area east of the river. In May of the same year, General Peng Xuefeng of the New Fourth Army led his troops eastward from Zhugou and joined forces with the Third Detachment in the Xihua area, merging into the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Detachment of the New Fourth Army. At the end of the year, most of the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Detachment continued eastward, penetrating deep behind enemy lines, and arrived at the junction of the three provinces of Anhui, Henan, and Jiangsu in the Haozhou, Yongcheng, and Xiaoxian areas, establishing the Yu-Wan-Su Border Region, which is now the Huaibei Military Region in Central China. Comrades Feng Sheng, Ma Qinghua, and others were left to lead the guerrilla detachment and continue to persist in the struggle in the area east of the river. At this time, traitorous armed forces were springing up everywhere in the Yudong area, bandits were rampant, and the enemy was constantly conducting frenzied mopping-up operations against our army. The environment was extremely difficult, but our army continued to resist the enemy and puppets unyieldingly, and took the initiative to attack the enemy. In the spring of 1939, during an ambush against the enemy on the Qixian highway, Comrade Ma Qinghua, the political commissar of our detachment, gloriously sacrificed his life. After a year of hard struggle, the enemy's attempt to eliminate our army completely failed. Not only was our army not eliminated, but it was greatly expanded with the support of the broad masses of people. At that time, the troops had grown to more than 3,000 people, and the Water East Independent Regiment was formally established in the spring of 1940. Under the active operations of our army, the enemy suffered severe blows, their ferocity greatly diminished, bandits were eliminated, and the people began to enjoy a relatively safe life. However, at this time, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a large-scale offensive against our Water East Liberated Area. When the Japanese army attacked, the Kuomintang troops fled to the west of the river and the Yellow River flooded area for refuge, handing the people of Water East over to the enemy. For three years, they had not made any attacks on the enemy, but at this time they were so mad that they did not fight the enemy, but instead attempted to drive our army out of Water East and hand the already liberated people of Water East back to the enemy. Under the command of Tang Enbo, they dispatched the 81st Division and other troops, in coordination with local enemy puppets, to launch a major offensive against our army. On April 17, 1941, in the south of Qixian, they buried alive Comrade Han Dasheng, the secretary of the CCP Water East Regional Committee, and more than 20 others, and successively massacred more than 1,000 of our soldiers and civilians. However, our army was not driven out because of this, and still steadfastly persisted in the Water East area. And these Kuomintang troops, who were \"brave in internal war,\" soon collapsed again under the sweeping of the Japanese army and fled back to the west of the river. As for the Kuomintang regime in various places in Water East, after the Japanese invaders occupied the counties in Yudong in 1938, they all fled into the Yellow River flooded area, and all they did was collect taxes and demand food, exploiting the people and never leading the people to carry out any anti-Japanese work. Therefore, at the enthusiastic request of the broad masses of people, our Water East Joint Defense Office was established in August of that year. Local mass leader Comrade Cui Ting was unanimously elected by the people as the director of the office. At the beginning of 1942, joint defense offices were successively established in the four counties of Qitong, Qibei, Qinan, and Suitai. At this point, our Water East Liberated Area began to develop and consolidate. In the spring of 1943, the Water East area was placed under the leadership of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, and the Fanshui Second Military Sub-district was formally established. In 1944, the Japanese launched a large-scale invasion of the Central Plains, and the Kuomintang army of 400,000 collapsed at the first touch. Most of Henan Province was lost, and the Kuomintang troops fleeing in the Yellow River flooded area and the Kuomintang exile regimes in various counties of Yudong successively betrayed the country and surrendered to the enemy. Qu Weihan, the commissioner of the 12th Administrative Region of Henan Province of the Kuomintang, could not maintain the situation and automatically announced the dissolution of the commissioner's office. Since the Kuomintang abandoned the broad masses of people in Yudong, our Water East Joint Defense Office formally established the Sixth Commissioner's Office of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region at the request of the people, and changed all the joint defense offices of the counties into county governments. In the spring of 1945, in order to save the people west of the river, our Water East Liberation Army dispatched a large number of troops to advance into the new Yellow River, and defeated the enemy puppets, cleared strongholds, west to the Pinghan Railway, and south to the Huai River, opening up the Water West Liberated Area including the vast areas of Yanling, Fugou, Xihua, Shangcai, and Shangshui counties, and stormed into the city of Fubian County. After the enemy surrendered, our Yudong Liberation Army launched a full-scale counter-offensive against the enemy puppets with thunderous force, successively recovering the four county towns of Qixian, Tongxu, Xihua, and Taikang, as well as countless other large and small strongholds. In these eight years of arduous war, according to not very accurate statistics, our army fought 4,909 times, killing and capturing a total of 623 Japanese soldiers and 9,229 puppet soldiers, seizing five cannons, 215 light and heavy machine guns, and 7,747 rifles and horses, liberating five county towns, more than 8,200 villages and towns, a population of about 3.6 million, and liberated territory of more than 40,000 square li. These achievements are the result of the sacrifices and bloodshed of our Yudong Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army. In the battle, 5,266 cadres and soldiers below the level of Brigade Political Commissar Tang Kewei, Regional Committee Secretary Han Dasheng, and Regiment Political Commissar Ma Qinghua were killed or wounded. At the same time, our Yudong Liberation Army and the anti-Japanese democratic government also led the people to carry out disaster relief, Yellow River management, land reclamation, rent reduction, and interest reduction. During the spring famine in 1943, our military and government personnel ate chaff and vegetables for as long as two months, and even ate tree bark, saving two ounces of grain per person per day to provide relief to the victims. In order to prevent the Yellow River from flooding, our Yudong democratic government allocated a total of 100,000 yuan and 180,000 jin of grain five times, mobilizing the people of Fugou, Taikang, and Xihua counties to build 51 li of embankments, saving 5.2 million mu of good land. Our Water East troops also personally helped the returning disaster victims to open up more than 20,000 mu of cultivated wasteland. These touching historical facts have been permanently preserved in the hearts of the broad masses of people in Yudong, which cannot be covered up by Kuomintang warmongering elements no matter what.\n    The Kuomintang reactionaries are unwilling to see the people of Yudong liberated. Instead of collecting enemy and puppet armed forces, they actively instigated the enemy and puppets in mid-September last year, using the 55th Army, 68th Army, 15th Army, and the Provisional 1st Division of the 47th Army, a total of about 70,000 troops, to surround our Yudong Liberated Area from all sides from Huaiyang, Shangqiu, Kaifeng, and other places, and launched a full-scale and fierce civil war against us. On October 7th, they occupied Fugou City, and within six days, they successively captured Taikang and Xihua cities. On the 9th, they occupied Tongxu City, and on the 14th, they attacked Qixian City. For the sake of peace, our army painfully withdrew from the Water West Liberated Area. But the Kuomintang was not satisfied, and launched continuous mopping-up operations in our Water East area. Wherever the Kuomintang army went, they committed all kinds of crimes, including rape, arson, killing, and looting. On September 16th, the 375th Regiment of the 119th Division in Yuzhenji, Qixian County, buried alive 12 villagers, including Liang Xuhuo, at one time. On the same day, in Liuzhai Village, the 356th Regiment of the 119th Division raped 48 women in the village in turn. Wang Peisong and other five people in Wangji, Taikang, were extorted a total of 570,000 yuan in silver dollars. In total, during this period, the Kuomintang army killed 236 people in our liberated areas, burned 145 houses, raped 1,203 women, extorted 2,170,500 yuan in silver dollars from the people, and robbed grain and clothing worth about 5,893,000 yuan in silver dollars. The soldiers and civilians in our Water East Liberated Area could no longer bear it, and rose up in self-defense, forcing the Kuomintang army to retreat to the county seat. But the Kuomintang army still took the opportunity to attack us from time to time. Even after the ceasefire on January 13th, they continued to attack our army, with as many as 53 large-scale invasions of more than 200 people. On March 14th, the 81st Division, with two regiments, divided its forces into three routes and occupied Fuji, Qixian County. On March 20th, the entire 81st Division launched a fierce attack on our troops stationed in Zhaocun, Liuzhai, and Mazhuang, killing and wounding 31 platoon leaders and lower ranks. However, under the efforts of all the soldiers and civilians in our Water East Liberated Area, the Kuomintang army's conspiracy to destroy our Water East Liberated Area completely failed again.\n    Now, in our Water East Liberated Area, north to the Longhai Railway (east from Tianzhuang Station to Xingzhiyuan Station), west to the new Yellow River, and south to the vast area along the line of Daiji, Anping, Zhanggong, and Tianzhuang in Xihua and Huaiyang, except for the county seat and a few market towns such as Fuji occupied by the Kuomintang, all the vast villages are still under the jurisdiction of the Sixth Military Sub-district of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region of our Water East Eighth Route Army. There are 5,400 villages in our liberated area, with an area of about 32,000 square li and a population of 2.44 million.\n    These ironclad facts cannot be obliterated by the Kuomintang's fabrications and lies. Historical facts cannot be changed at will. The Kuomintang's shameless rumors are just a trick of reactionary conspirators, attempting to use the denial of the existence of our Water East Liberated Area as an excuse to launch a large-scale offensive against us.\n    Now this offensive has begun. Since the 11th of this month, the Kuomintang has successively occupied the Changgang, Yindian, Wagang, Zhuanlou, Chaozhuang area in the southwest thirty to forty li of Suixian, which is our hinterland. On the 14th, the 81st Division and another unit of the Suixian Security Corps invaded Houzigang. Our Yudong soldiers and civilians are now fighting fiercely with the stubborn puppets in the Suixian, Qixian, and Taikang areas to defend democracy and peace. The soldiers and civilians tempered by eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to defend their own interests, know what to do, and are now doing what they should do. The warmongering elements of the Kuomintang have torn up the ceasefire agreement and launched a civil war. The people of Yudong have seen their hideous faces clearly.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n人物 (People):\n\n吴芝圃    Wu Zhipu\n王介甫    Wang Jiepu\n王徕文    Wang Laiwen\n彭雪枫    Peng Xuefeng\n冯胜      Feng

豫东解放区原包括水东（新黄河以东），水西两部分，远在一九三八年五月郑州会战时，日军大举进犯豫东，国民党军不战而溃，闻风逃窜。杞县、睢县、太康等城先后沦于敌手。中国共产党员吴芝圃、王介甫、王徕文等，即结合当地抗日志士，成立新四军抗日三支队，转战于睢县、杞县、通许、太康地区，领导豫东人民积极打击敌伪，开创了水东抗日游击根据地，同年五月，新四军彭雪枫将军从竹沟率部东进，与三支队在西华一带会合，乃合编为新四军抗日游击大队。年底抗日游击大队大部继续东进，深入敌后，到达安徽、河南、江苏三省交界处之毫州、永城、萧县地区，创立豫皖苏边区，即现在华中之淮北军区，仍留冯胜、马庆华等同志领导游击大队，继续坚持水东地区斗争。此时豫东地区汉奸武装遍地滋生，土匪到处横行，敌人则不断的向我军进行疯狂的扫荡，环境异常艰险，但我军仍继续不屈不挠的抗击敌伪，并主动的去袭击敌人。就在一九三九年春，我军在杞县公路上伏击敌人的战斗中，我大队政委马庆华同志光荣的牺牲了。经过一年的艰苦奋斗，敌人消灭我军的企图，完全失败了，我军不仅未被消灭，在广大民众的拥护下，反而大大的扩大了。当时部队已发展至三千余人，遂于一九四零年春正式成立水东独立团。在我军积极的作战下，敌人遭受了严重的打击，凶焰大减，土匪也肃清了，人民开始得到了比较安全的生活。然而就在这个时候，国民党反动派对我水东解放区发动了大规模攻势，日寇进攻时，国民党军队望风逃到河西及黄泛区去避难，把水东人民拱手送给敌人。三年来未曾丝毫对敌人作过任何攻击，此时却丧心病狂放着敌人不打，竟妄图将我军逐出水东，把水东已解放了的民众，重交敌人。在汤恩伯的指挥下，派遣了八十一师等部队，配合当地敌伪疯狂的向我军发动了大举进攻，于四一年四月十七日在杞县南，将我中共水东地区地委书记韩达生同志等二十余人活埋，先后屠杀我军民达千余名之多，但是我军并未因此而被逐出，依然坚定不移的坚持了水东地区。而这些“勇于内战”的国民党军队，却不久便在日寇的扫荡下，再次的溃败回河西去了。至于水东各地的国民党政权，自三八年日寇侵陷豫东各县后，即已悉数逃入黄泛区，整日唯以征款、要粮剥削为能事，从未领导人民作过丝毫抗日工作。因此，在广大人民的热烈要求下，我水东联防办事处乃于是年八月成立，经人民一致推选当地群众领袖崔廷同志为办事处主任，并于一九四二年初，相继建立了杞通、杞北、杞南、睢太等四个县的联防办事处。至此，我水东解放区开始走上了发展与巩固的阶段。四三年春，水东区划归冀鲁豫边区领导，乃正式建立泛水二军分区。四四年日本大举进犯中原，国民党大军四十万，一触即溃，河南省大部失守，逃窜在黄泛区里的国民党军队及豫东各县国民党流亡政权，相继叛国投敌。国民党河南十二专区专员屈维汉，无法维持，自动宣布专署解散。国民党既抛弃豫东广大人民于不顾，我水东联防办事处始应人民之请，正式成立冀鲁豫第六专员公署，并将各县联防办事处，一律改为县政府。四五年春，我水东解放军，为了拯救水西民众，乃派遣大批部队挺进新黄河，并打退敌伪，扫除据点，西至平汉线，南抵淮河，开辟了包括鄢陵、扶沟、西华、上蔡、商水等县广大地区的水西解放区，且一举攻入扶边县城。敌寇投降后，我豫东解放军更以雷霆万钧之势，对敌伪发动全面反攻，接连收复杞县、通许、西华、太康四个县城，以及其他大小据点无数。在这八年的艰苦战争中，仅根据不甚精确的统计，我军即作战四九○九次，共毙俘日军六二三名，毙俘伪军九二二九名，缴获大炮五门，轻重机枪二一五挺，步马枪七七四七只，共解放县城五座，村镇八千二百余处，人口约三百六十余万，解放国土达四万余平方华里。而这些战绩，都是我豫东八路军、新四军牺牲流血得到的成果。在战斗中，我伤亡旅政委唐克威，地委书记韩达生，团政委马庆华以下干部及战士五二六六名。同时，我豫东解放军及抗日民主政权，并领导人民进行了救灾、治黄、开荒、减租、减息等工作。当四三年春荒时期，我军政人员曾有两月之久，吃糠咽菜，甚至采食树皮，每人每日节约粮食二两拿来赈济灾民。而为了防止黄河泛滥，我豫东民主政权曾五次共拨款十万元，拨粮十八万斤，发动扶（沟）、太（康）、西（华）三县民众修堤五十一华里，救出良田五百二十万亩。我水东部队又亲自动手，帮助回乡灾民开出熟荒二万余亩。这些可歌可泣的史迹，已永远存留在豫东广大人民的心里，这是国民党好战分子无论如何也不能掩盖的。\n    国民党反动派不愿看到我豫东人民得到解放，不去收缴敌伪武装，却积极策动敌伪于去年九月中旬，以五十五军六十八军十五军，及四十七军之暂一师等七个师，共约七万之众，自淮阳、商邱、开封等地四面包围我豫东解放区，向我发动全面猛烈内战，于十月七日，占我扶沟城，六日连陷我太康、西华两城，九日又攻占我通许城，十四日更进攻我杞县城，我军为了和平，忍痛退出水西解放区。但国民党意犹未足，复在我水东地区展开连续不断的清剿扫荡。国民党军队所到之处，奸淫烧杀抢掠，无所不为。九月十六日，在杞县圉镇集一一九师三七五团，一次即活埋村民梁叙合等十二名。同日在刘寨村，一一九师三五六团轮奸强奸该村妇女达四十八人。仅太康王集王培松等五人，即被讹诈大洋五十七万元。总计在这一时期内，国民党军队共杀死我解放区民众二三六人，烧毁房屋一四五间，奸淫妇女一二○三人，讹诈民众大洋二一七○五万元，抢去粮食衣服等约值洋五八九三万元，我水东解放区军民忍无可忍，乃奋起自卫，迫使国民党军队退守县城。但国民党军队仍不时乘隙向我进袭，即在元月十三日和平停战后，亦继续不断向我军进攻，仅二百人以上较大规模之进犯，即达五十三次之多，并于三月十四日八十一师以二个团之众，分兵三路，进占我杞县之傅集。三月二十日，更以八十一师全师兵力，连续向我驻赵村、刘寨、马庄部队发动猛攻，死伤我排长以下三十一名。然而在我水东解放区全体军民的努力自卫之下，国民党军队企图摧毁我水东解放区的阴谋，又完全破产了。\n    现在我水东解放区北界陇海铁路（东起田庄车站，西至杏枝园车站），西至新黄河，南抵西华、淮阳代集、安平、张弓、田庄一线之广大地区内，除县城及傅集等几个集镇被国民党侵占外，所有广大的村庄仍然在我水东八路军冀鲁豫第六军分区管辖之下。我解放区共有村庄五千四百个，面积约三万二千平方华里，人口达二百四十四万。\n    这些铁一般的事实，绝不是国民党捏造撒谎所能抹煞的，历史的事实是绝不能随意改换的，国民党的这种无耻的造谣，只不过是反动派阴谋家的一个鬼计，企图以否认我水东解放区的存在为借口，向我发动大规模的进攻。\n    现在这种进攻开始了，自本月十一日起国民党已经先后占领了我睢县西南三四十里之我腹心地区长岗、尹店、瓦岗、砖楼、潮庄一带；十四日八十一师与睢县保安团队另一部进犯我厚子岗。我豫东军民为保卫民主，保卫和平，现正在睢县、杞县、太康地区与顽伪激战中。经过八年抗战锻炼的军民，为了保卫自己的利益，他们知道应该怎样做，现在是按应该做的做了。国民党好战分子，撕毁停战协定，发动内战，它的狞恶面孔，豫东人民是看得清清楚楚的了。"

Fifty-five worker representatives represented 32 trade unions in the city, including railways, electricity, automobiles, flour, flatbed carts, bathhouses, barber shops, general merchandise, iron, wood, and construction, with 1,900 members and more than 4,000 workers. The conference lasted for three days, summarizing the development of the labor movement in Xingtai City over the past seven months, and pointed out: (1) The workers of Xingtai City are the locomotives in the mass struggle against traitors and for the redress of grievances. The famous \"City Damen Hutong Gong\" and the struggle against the traitor and local tyrant Meng Xianda were both led by workers. (2) A large number of trade union cadres have been trained and participated in government work. (3) The treatment of workers and shop assistants has been initially improved, rickshaw workers have been organized to change careers and engage in transportation, and more than 40,000 jin of grain have been provided to unemployed railway workers.

    "content": "【Xinhua News Agency, Xingtai】After deepening the anti-traitor, rent reduction, and capital increase movements, the masses of Xingtai City are now actively organizing cooperative production with the benefits they have obtained. Currently, in streets such as Malu Street, Yangshi Street, Dingshi Street, and Mashi Street in the city, eight cooperatives of various industries have been organized, with capital reaching 1,497,000 yuan. (Among them, 1,370,000 yuan is from the fruits of struggle as shares, 38,000 yuan from mass shareholding, and 80,000 yuan from democratic government loans.) In half a month, the eight cooperatives organized 420 women in the city for spinning and weaving. Seventy-nine small vendors received low-interest sales loans from the cooperatives, and twenty-five rickshaw pullers were organized for transportation. In just fifteen days, profits of over 80,000 yuan were obtained. The production enthusiasm of the masses in each street is even higher. In the process of organizing production with the fruits of struggle, the following initial experiences have been gained: (1) Organizing cooperative production with the fruits of victory must be based on the masses' conscious willingness to consolidate it. After the Yangshi Street People's Association struggled against Miao Yongyi, the leadership distributed the fruits to the masses and, based on their enthusiasm, guided them to organize production. After ideological clearance, the masses voluntarily contributed shares and opened a coal factory. In this type of cooperative production, everyone feels like they are the masters, and their production enthusiasm is a hundred times higher. Conversely, the Malu Street coal factory failed because the fruits of the struggle were not contributed by the masses voluntarily, and the masses were not interested in the cooperative. (2) In terms of cooperative business policies, it should be combined with the vital interests of the masses, such as the support of various factories for women's spinning and weaving, and the assistance to small vendors and rickshaw pullers, truly achieving mutual benefit for both the public and private sectors. The cause of cooperative production will be further consolidated and expanded. (3) In the leadership of cooperative production factories, it is advisable to adopt a piece-rate wage system, with proportional wage increases for exceeding production quotas, so that production efficiency can be rapidly improved.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n邢台市\tXingtai Shi (Xingtai City)\n马路街\tMalu Jie (Malu Street)\n羊市街\tYangshi Jie (Yangshi Street)\n靛市街\tDingshi Jie (Dingshi Street)\n马市街\tMashi Jie (Mashi Street)\n新华社\tXinhua She (Xinhua News Agency)\n苗永衣\tMiao Yongyi\n平民会\tPingmin Hui (People's Association)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 邢台市深入群运后  群众组织合作生产  八个合作社组织了四百纺妇\n\n1946-05-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　邢台市深入群运后\n    群众组织合作生产\n    八个合作社组织了四百纺妇\n    【新华社邢台讯】经过深入反奸灭租增资后的邢台市群众，现正以自己获得的利益，积极组织合作生产。该市马路街、羊市街、靛市街、马市街等街，目前已组织起八个各业合作社，资金达一百四十九万七千余元。（其中斗争果实入股一百三十七万元，群众入股三万八千元，民主政府贷款八万元）八个合作社在半月中，组织了市内妇女四百二十人进行纺织，七十九个小商贩，得到合作社的低利运销贷款，二十五个小车工人被组织运输。仅十五天中，即获利八万余元。各街群众，生产情绪，遂更高涨，在将斗争果实组织生产过程中，已初步获得如下经验：（一）将胜利果实组织合作生产，必须群众自觉自愿才能巩固。羊市街平民会斗争苗永衣后，领导上即将果实分配给群众，在群众的热情基础上，引导他们组织起来进行生产，经过思想打通后，再由群众自愿入股，开办了煤厂。这样的合作生产，大家认为自己是主人，生产积极性即百倍高涨。反之马路街煤厂，由于斗争果实不是经过群众自愿的入股，群众对合作社不感兴趣，结果生产失败了。（二）合作营业方针上，应与群众切身利益相结合，如各厂对妇女纺织的扶植，对小贩小车工人的帮助，真正达到了公私两利，合作生产的事业，也就更加巩固与扩大了。（三）合作生产的工厂领导上，宜采取按件工资制，超过的产量按比例增资，这样才能使生产效率飞速提高。"

    "content": "Chicken Foot and Other Counties Prevent Summer Floods\n    Hundreds of Thousands of People Dredge Rivers and Open Canals\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan News] In southern Hebei, hundreds of thousands of people in Chicken Foot (Jize), Jiangping, Wuyi, Hengshui, Nangong, Yongnian and other counties are actively dredging rivers, opening canals, and building water conservancy projects to solve the long-unresolved summer flooding problem in the area and substantially increase production. Since the beginning of spring, the area has established two river affairs bureaus, and 32 counties have established water affairs committees. The administrative office has also distributed 7,100,000 catties of grain and 1,340,000 yuan in Hebei currency for river dredging. The Chicken Foot River Affairs Committee is currently leading the masses in 169 villages under its jurisdiction to actively dredge the Ox Tail River, the Little Zhang River sluice gate, the Xinglongwan Civilization Ditch, and the Nanxingzhuang sluice gate. Twenty-eight irrigation canals have also been added to both sides of the major rivers, with a total length of more than 32,000 zhang, requiring more than 224,000 workdays. This can irrigate more than 49,000 mu of land. In addition to preventing floods every year, it can also turn the land into paddy fields, increasing grain production by more than 2,450,000 catties. The area of Longping County has many low-lying areas and rivers, among which the Feng River breaches its banks every year, and more than 1,000 hectares of fertile land along the river are often affected by disasters. On the 28th of last month, the democratic government led 20,000 people along the river to dredge a section of the silted riverbed of the Feng River from Beiwuding to Zhangjiakou Bridge, totaling more than 4,500 zhang, which took eight days to complete. Thousands of hectares of wheat fields along the river can be harvested without worry. In Wuyi County, more than 20 villages, including Zida and Antuo, have terrain like a basin. Every summer and autumn, tens of thousands of mu of fertile land accumulate water that cannot be drained. There is no hope of harvesting in the summer, and autumn plowing cannot be planted in time. Farmers suffering from water established a canal opening committee under the leadership of the democratic government, dividing the north and south canals, which are more than 20 li long, so that the water flows directly into the river. The two canals were completed at the end of last month, and from then on, the farmers in more than 20 villages will be free from the worry of floods. During the river dredging, government cadres took the lead from top to bottom, dredging with the masses.

Furthermore, the State Department has not obtained sufficient intelligence to prove that Soviet troops and CCP troops are jointly fighting against the Chinese Nationalist Army.

Teachers personally participate and provide constant leadership, while students actively participate in production, organizing manure collection groups, thread reeling groups, ribbon weaving groups, salt leaching groups, firewood gathering groups, cotton spinning groups, plowing groups, and millstone pushing groups, showing great enthusiasm. At Pan Village Elementary School in Wei County, the half-catty of hemp seeds and thirty willow trees planted around the school buildings were used as teaching materials in the planting process, explaining the uses and planting methods of hemp seeds and willow trees. At the same time, their studies were not affected by production. Students often brought books to the fields, discussing and studying with each other while walking. If they forgot something, they would take out their books. They not only completed school production tasks but also helped families of soldiers and martyrs by collecting manure and firewood. They also fulfilled their responsibilities in assisting with household production. At Ji'ze's Yingcheng Elementary School, students organized mutual aid groups to help families with production. At Julu's First Complete Elementary School, more than twenty female students have already started weaving cloth, weaving one bolt a day, earning 290 yuan silver dollars. Female students at Gaotang's Peizhuang Elementary School have earned more than 4,700 yuan in two months of weaving, and the profits have been deposited into the cooperative to help solve part of the family's production needs. Their parents happily say, \"At first, we used to take money to the school, but now we are bringing money home.\" The border region's elementary education has been able to consolidate and continuously develop during the eight years of the War of Resistance and the four years of famine because, under the slogan of \"combining study and production,\" children were organized for collective learning and production.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n冀南  Jì'nán (Southern Hebei)\n威县  Wēixiàn (Wei County)\n潘村小学  Pān Cūn Xiǎoxué (Pan Village Elementary School)\n鸡泽  Jīzé (Ji'ze County)\n就营城小学  Jiù Yíngchéng Xiǎoxué (Yingcheng Elementary School)\n巨鹿第一完小  Jùlù Dì Yī Wánxiǎo (Julu's First Complete Elementary School)\n高唐裴庄初小  Gāotáng Péizhuāng Chūxiǎo (Gaotang's Peizhuang Elementary School)\n合作社  Hézuòshè (Cooperative)\n抗战  Kàngzhàn (War of Resistance Against Japan)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀南各地小学  一面学习一面生产  裴庄初小女生纺织，两月赚洋四千元\n\n1946-05-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀南各地小学\n    一面学习一面生产\n    裴庄初小女生纺织，两月赚洋四千元\n    【本报冀南讯】冀南各地小学，在教育与生产密切结合的方针下，都热烈的卷入了生产运动。教员亲自动手和经常领导，学生们都积极参加生产，组织积肥组、拐线组、织带组、淋盐组、拾柴组、纺花组、拉犁组、推磨组，情绪很高。威县潘村小学在校舍周围种的半斤大麻籽，卅棵柳树，在种的过程中，把麻籽，柳树的用处、种法等，都做了教材，同时他们在生产时并未影响学习，学生往地里去，时常带着书本，一边走一边互相问答研究，如忘了，就把书本拿出来。他们不但完成学校生产，还担任帮助抗属拾肥、拾柴。在帮助家庭生产上，他们也尽了应尽的责任。鸡泽就营城小学，学生组织互助组，帮助家庭进行生产。巨鹿第一完小，有二十多女生现已开始织布，每天可织一匹，赚洋二百九十元。高唐裴庄初小女生，两个月的纺织，已赚了四千七百余元，现已将红利入了合作社，解决家庭生产一部，她们的家长都喜欢的说：“起先往学校拿钱，这会倒往家里拿钱。”边区小学教育，在抗战八年和四年灾荒中，能够巩固而且不断的发展下去，也就是在一面学习一面生产的口号下，把儿童组织起来，集体学习和生产。"

    "content": "The Battle to Defend Sipingjie\n    ——*Liberation Daily* Commentary\n    The battle to defend Sipingjie has lasted a full month, and the city is still being firmly defended by the Democratic Allied Army.\n\n    Since April 16th, the Kuomintang authorities have successively used seven divisions to launch a fierce encircling attack on Sipingjie from the south, southwest, and northwest. The warmongers within the Kuomintang, relying on their American-equipped weapons, with approximately 2,000 artillery shells per hour, plus air support, were confident that they could easily seize this peaceful and democratic city, which the Northeast people had just established, from the hands of the Northeast people. However, the strong resistance of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army met them with a rebuff. In the past month, four fierce attacks (April 21st, 22nd, 23rd, and 25th) have all been repelled. By early May, the front line at Sipingjie had reached a stalemate, the Kuomintang army's morale was dampened, and soldiers' war-weariness and instances of voluntarily defecting to our side began to occur.\n\n    The battle to defend Sipingjie demonstrated the strength of the Democratic Allied Army's self-defense capabilities. The Democratic Allied Army is resolutely fighting to defend peace, democracy, and the interests of the Northeast people. They have gained the support of the broad masses of the Northeast people, and they have also received the sympathy of the people and democrats throughout the country. Anyone who wants to eliminate them by force will not succeed. However, the Kuomintang warmongers are not giving up their ambitions. They continue to expand the civil war in the Northeast, continue to reinforce and attack Sipingjie. Currently, Liao Yaoxiang, commander of the New Sixth Army, is personally leading the front-line troops in the attack, and Zheng Dongguo, deputy commander of the security forces, and Liang Huasheng are also personally directing the battle on the front lines. From the 14th, the fierce fighting on the front lines intensified again. From the 18th, the Kuomintang army began to use tanks. In the past few days, although the Kuomintang army has been under the cover of airplanes and tanks, they have still been repelled by the Democratic Allied Army and suffered heavy losses. On the 16th and 17th alone, the Kuomintang army lost over a thousand men.\n\n    In the face of the Northeast people and the Democratic Allied Army's incomparably brave and resolute resistance, the Kuomintang warmongers still recklessly waste the lives of a large number of innocent officers and soldiers, expand their attacks on the Northeast people, and provoke attacks on the liberated areas in various parts of Guannei in order to cooperate with the civil war in the Northeast, thereby undermining national peace. This is because these warmongers place their hopes on continued assistance from the US military (equipment, training, transportation, etc.). The warmongers are also trying to use this assistance to gradually drag the United States into the quagmire of the Chinese civil war. It is undeniable that American assistance is one of the important factors in the continued expansion of the civil war in the Northeast today, and this assistance is contrary to the peaceful wishes of the American people. The US authorities should immediately stop all this assistance, especially immediately stop helping the Kuomintang army transport troops and equipment, in order to promote peace in China and enhance the friendship between the Chinese and American people.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\nPeople:\n\n廖耀湘  Liao Yaoxiang\n郑洞国  Zheng Dongguo\n梁华盛  Liang Huasheng\n\nPlaces:\n\n四平街  Sipingjie\n东北  Northeast\n关内  Guannei\n\nOrganizations:\n\n民主联军  Democratic Allied Army\n新六军  New Sixth Army\n国民党  Kuomintang\n解放日报  Liberation Daily\n\nEvents:\n\n四平街保卫战  Battle to Defend Sipingjie\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 四平街保卫战——解放日报时评\n\n1946-05-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　四平街保卫战\n    ——解放日报时评\n    保卫四平街之战，已整整过了一个月，该城现在仍在民主联军坚守中。\n    从上月十六日起，国民党当局先后以七个师的兵力，从南面、西南、西北三方面向四平街军进行了猛烈的包围进攻，国民党内好战分子倚恃着他们的美械装备，每小时二千发左右的炮弹，加上飞机助战，满以为很容易从东北人民的手里夺取他们刚刚建立起来的这一座和平民主的城市。但东北民主联军的坚强抵抗，使他们碰了壁。一月以来，四次猛烈的进攻（四月二十一、二十二、二十三及二十五日），都被打退。至五月上旬，四平街前线陷于胶着状态，国民党军队的锐气受到了挫折，士兵厌战的情绪和自动向我投诚的事件，开始发生。\n    四平街保卫战，表现了民主联军自卫力量的强大，民主联军坚决为着保卫和平民主及东北人民利益而战。他们得到了广大东北人民的拥护，也得到了全国人民及民主人士的同情，任何人要想用武力消灭他们，是做不到的。但是，国民党好战分子野心不死，仍然坚持扩大东北内战，继续向四平街增援进攻，现新六军军长廖耀湘，正在自率第一线部队攻击，保安副司令郑洞国及梁华盛，亦亲临前线指挥。十四日起，前线激战又趋猛烈。十八日起，国民党军开始使用坦克。几天以来，国民党军虽在飞机、坦克掩护之下，但仍被民主联军击退，并遭受重大损失，十六、十七两日，国民党军损失上千。\n    国民党内好战分子在东北人民与民主联军的英勇无比的坚决抵抗前面，仍然不惜枉费大量的无辜官兵的生命，向东北人民扩大进攻，并在关内各地向解放区挑衅进攻，以配合东北内战，从而破坏全国的和平，这是因为这些好战分子把希望寄托在美军方面的继续帮助（装备、训练、运输等等）上面，好战分子并力图利用这种援助，把美国一步一步地拉进中国内战的泥坑中。不可否认的，美国的帮助是今天东北内战继续扩大的重要因素之一，而这种帮助是与美国人民的和平愿望相违反的，美国当局应当立即停止这一切帮助，特别是立即停止帮助国民党军运兵运械，以便促进中国的和平，增进中美人民的友谊。"

On the 16th and 17th, the Kuomintang army lost a thousand men in the offensive. On the 18th, they launched an attack under the cover of aircraft and tanks, but were still unsuccessful. (2) The Kuomintang's 66th and 75th armies in the Central Plains, in violation of the Hankou Agreement, divided their forces into six routes on the 16th to encircle and attack the southwestern Shoushan area of Yingshan in western Pinghan Road in the Central Plains Military Region, and have already occupied many villages and towns. Fierce battles are currently underway. (3) In Jinan City, Shandong Province, five or six Kuomintang aircraft land every night, each carrying forty to fifty soldiers. Including the previously airlifted troops, there are approximately 20,000 soldiers. The 12th and 96th armies in Jinan have been attacking the area south of the city since the 10th, and are continuing their incursions. Wang Jimei's puppet troops in Zaozhuang obtained 45 boxes of ammunition transported by Kuomintang aircraft on the 10th, and also show signs of unrest. (4) In Rehe, the Kuomintang army invading Rehe is frequently mobilizing and deploying for civil war. The Kuomintang army is constantly harassing areas such as Pingquan and Jianchang southeast of Chifeng. On the 11th, an aircraft flew over Chengde to conduct reconnaissance. The headquarters of the Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning Military Region issued a statement protesting. In addition, on the 15th, Kuomintang aircraft flew to sweep near Fu County in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Zuoyun in northwestern Shanxi was also harassed by aircraft on the 13th.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Siping Street, 19th] Fierce battles have been taking place on the Siping Street front for days. On the 16th and 17th, the invading army lost over a thousand men. On the 16th, they launched an attack under the cover of aircraft and tanks, but were still unsuccessful. The battle report for the past three days is as follows: On the morning of the 16th, two battalions of the Kuomintang army launched an attack on Sandaolinzi and were immediately repelled by the Democratic Allied Army. At the same time, near Yangmulinzi, a Kuomintang aircraft was shot down, and the pilot parachuted to safety. The Kuomintang army has used tanks on the Siping Street front. Yesterday, four Kuomintang tanks, joined by two companies of remnants, attacked the position south of Siping Street. At the same time, four tanks were also dispatched to the position near Keshan, all of which were repelled by the defending troops. On the morning of the 17th, the Kuomintang army used a battalion of troops, concentrating more than twenty artillery pieces, to attack the Sandaolinzi position of the Democratic Allied Army. One company once charged into the defending troops' position. After half an hour of hand-to-hand combat, except for more than ten people who escaped, the rest were all annihilated. The other two companies were severely damaged by dense machine gun crossfire when approaching the position of the Democratic Allied Army. Except for thirty-odd people who escaped, the rest were killed. On the 16th, the Kuomintang army in Banlamenzi, southeast of Siping Street, launched a fierce attack, but was thwarted, with the invaders suffering six to seven hundred casualties.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\nPeople:\n\n王继美  Wang Jimei\n\nPlaces:\n\n延安  Yan'an\n东北  Northeast China\n四平街  Siping Street\n中原  Central Plains\n汉口  Hankou\n平汉路  Pinghan Road\n应山西南寿山地区  Southwestern Shoushan area of Yingshan\n山东  Shandong\n济南市  Jinan City\n枣庄  Zaozhuang\n热河  Rehe\n赤峰  Chifeng\n平泉  Pingquan\n建昌  Jianchang\n承德  Chengde\n冀热辽军区  Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning Military Region\n陕甘宁边区  Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region\n鄜县  Fu County\n晋西北  Northwestern Shanxi\n左云  Zuoyun\n三道林子  Sandaolinzi\n杨木林子  Yangmulinzi\n克山  Keshan\n半拉子门  Banlamenzi\n\nOrganizations:\n\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n国民党  Kuomintang\n国民党六十六军  Kuomintang 66th Army\n国民党七十五军  Kuomintang 75th Army\n中原军区  Central Plains Military Region\n济南十二军  Jinan 12th Army\n济南九十六军  Jinan 96th Army\n民主联军  Democratic Allied Army\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 四平街前线连日激战  国民党军枉死千余  以飞机坦克掩护冲锋均未获逞\n\n1946-05-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　四平街前线连日激战\n    国民党军枉死千余\n    以飞机坦克掩护冲锋均未获逞\n    【新华社延安十九日电】本社今日综合军息：（一）东北四平街保卫战已达三十二天，连日均有激战。十六、十七两日，国民党军在进攻中损失千人，十八日以飞机坦克掩护冲锋，仍未得逞。（二）中原国民党六十六军及七十五军所部，违背汉口协议，于十六日分兵六路围攻中原军区平汉路西应山西南寿山地区，已侵占村镇多处，现正激战中。（三）山东济南市，每夜均有国民党飞机五六架降落，每架载军队四五十人，连前空运部队约有二万人。济南十二军及九十六军所部，自十日起进攻该城以南一带，现仍继续进犯。枣庄伪军王继美部，十日获得国民党飞机运来之弹药四十五箱，亦有蠢动模样。（四）热河，侵入热河的国民党军，调动频繁，布置内战。赤峰东南平泉、建昌等地，国民党军不断出扰。十一日有飞机一架至承德上空侦察，冀热辽军区司令部特发表声明抗议。此外，陕甘宁边区境内鄜县附近，十五日有国民党飞机飞来扫射。晋西北的左云，于十三日也遭到飞机骚扰。\n    【新华社四平街十九日电】四平街前线连日均有激战，十六、十七两日，进犯军损失上千，十六日以飞机坦克掩护冲锋，仍未得逞，兹志三日战报如下：十六日上午，国民党两个营，向三道林子进攻，即被民主联军击退。同时在杨木林子附近，击落国民党飞机一架，驾驶员跳伞脱逃。国民党军在四平街前线，已使用坦克车，昨日有国民党坦克四辆，纠合残兵两个连，向四平街以南阵地进攻。同时，在克山附近阵地，亦出动坦克四辆，均被守军击退。十七日早晨，国民党军以一个营兵力，集中大炮廿余门，向民主联军三道林子阵地进攻，其中一个连曾冲进守军阵地，经半小时白刃战后，除十余人逃回，其余全部被歼灭。另两个连于接近民主联军阵地时，被密集之机枪交叉火力严重杀伤，除三十余人逃生外，其余均被击毙。十六日，四平街东南半拉子门国民党军曾发动猛攻，但遭挫败，进犯者伤亡六、七百人。"

The method is that each police officer will be responsible for 80 to 120 households or 400 to 600 people within the area of their branch bureau.

On all fronts of the Chinese civil war, they continue to concentrate large numbers of Kuomintang troops. A reporter from the Shanghai United Daily in Beiping learned that on all fronts, the Kuomintang concentrated thirty-five army corps, totaling approximately one million people. At the same time, adding the puppet troops reorganized in various places, there are 450,000 in North China and 350,000 at Shanhaiguan. The Kuomintang has dispatched a total of 1.8 million Kuomintang and puppet troops to attack the Liberated Areas. Other newspapers have also pointed out that although a ceasefire agreement was signed as early as January 10th, the Kuomintang used ninety-nine divisions to attack the Communist troops, and these troops were secretly mobilized without notifying the Beiping Executive Headquarters. An American telegraphic news report commented on the Kuomintang's rejection of the peace proposals put forward by the Democratic League, saying: This shows that the Kuomintang is unwilling to establish peace in the country. Foreign and Chinese newspapers have reported that Kuomintang soldiers are refusing to participate in the civil war and are surrendering to the Communist troops, and the number is increasing every day. A reporter from the American \"Newsweek\" magazine interviewed captured Kuomintang soldiers in Benxi Lake. They unanimously stated that they were unwilling to wage a war that would brutally kill their own compatriots, and that they had been deceived into participating in the civil war.

    "content": "Bureaucratic Capital Fills Taiwan\n    Various Industrial Productivity Generally Declines\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th】According to a speech by Ju Keyong, Director of the Department of Industry and Mining of Taiwan Province, published in a Central News Agency dispatch from Taipei on the 12th, almost all industrial and mining enterprises in Taipei are currently established by bureaucratic capital. The authorities have established management committees for sugar, electricity and metallurgy, petroleum, fertilizer, cement, coal, alkali production, gold and copper mines, electrical engineering, machinery, paper, textiles, chemicals, oils and fats, glass, printing, and industrial and mining equipment industries. The handling methods involve joint ventures between the central and provincial governments, or joint ventures between local and private entities, followed by acceptance according to \"legal procedures\" (which clearly benefits bureaucratic capital). Four types of defense industries have been designated as state-owned, and preparations are underway to organize companies monopolizing industrial and mining industries, including twenty-one units such as petroleum and sugar. Although Mr. Bao explained that private investment is allowed, there is no doubt that private capital will only be rejected under the legal procedures or participate as an appendage of bureaucratic capital. Mr. Bao's speech also revealed that Taiwan's industry, under the monopoly of bureaucratic capital, cannot develop and cannot even restore its past productivity. For example, in the entire industrial and mining sector, the most important sugar industry only produced 90,000 tons this year, while the highest past output was 1.3 million tons, only one-fifteenth of the past. Coal production is 90,000 tons per month (past monthly production was 200,000 tons). Power generation is 52,000 kilowatts, while the highest past capacity was 328,000 kilowatts, less than one-fifth of the past.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n台湾  Taiwan\n台北  Taipei\n句可永  Ju Keyong\n台省工矿处  Department of Industry and Mining of Taiwan Province\n中央社  Central News Agency\n延安  Yan'an\n包氏  Mr. Bao\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 官僚资本充斥台湾  各种工业生产力普遍下降\n\n1946-05-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　官僚资本充斥台湾\n    各种工业生产力普遍下降\n    【新华社延安十八日电】根据中央社台北十二日电所发表的台省工矿处处长句可永谈话，目前台北工矿事业几乎全部为官僚资本所设，当局已设有管理委员会者，计有糖、电冶、石油、肥料、水泥、煤、制碱、金铜矿、电工、机械、纸、纺织、化学、油脂、玻璃、印刷、工矿器材等业。处理办法，分别由中央与省合营，或地方与民合营后按“法定秩序”（按这显然是对官僚资本有利）的程序接收。四种国防工业已划归国营，刻拟筹备组织垄断工矿业的公司，竟包括了石油、糖业等二十一单位。虽然包氏说明允许人民投资，但没有疑问的，民资将只有在法定程序下被拒于门外，或作为官僚资本的附从才能参加。包氏谈话又透露了台湾工业在官僚资本垄断下，无法发展，甚至不能恢复过去的生产力。如在整个工矿事业中，最重要的糖业，本年仅产九万吨，过去最高产量本为一百三十万吨，仅为过去的十五分之一。煤产每月九万吨（过去月产二十万吨）。发电力五万二千瓦，过去最高量三十二万八千瓦，不及过去五分之一。"

The mine has a total of 500 family members. During the Japanese occupation, most relied on the wages of the men. One man often had to support three or four people. Because the wages were low, the families often couldn't make a living and were forced to wander and beg for food. After liberation, under the leadership of the trade union, a workers' cooperative was organized with 200,000 yuan in shares to purchase large quantities of cotton and spinning wheels to support the family members in spinning. At the beginning, some people were unwilling to spin. Hao Fenglin, a miner's family member, first organized a spinning group of seven people. The cooperative lent each person two catties of cotton and a spinning wheel. In 25 days, they spun a total of 54 catties of cotton, earning 3,510 yuan. This practical example encouraged all the families in the mine. Within three months, the number of women participating in spinning increased to 653. With the development of spinning, the families' thinking has also greatly improved. Many people have recognized the glory of labor and that they can only live a good life by relying on their own labor. Family spinning is still continuing to expand.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n峰峰矿区职工会 Fengfeng Kuangqu Zhigong Hui (Fengfeng Mining District Trade Union)\n磁县  Cixian\n峰峰矿区  Fengfeng Kuangqu (Fengfeng Mining District)\n长治  Changzhi\n郝凤林  Hao Fenglin\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 峰峰矿区职工会  组织职工家属生产\n\n1946-05-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　峰峰矿区职工会\n    组织职工家属生产\n    【本报长治讯】磁县峰峰矿区职工家属，正积极进行生产，建立幸福的家庭。该矿共有家属五百人，日寇占领时，大都依靠男人工资生活，一人甚至有养活三四人者，由于工资低微，一家常常不能维持生活，被迫到处流离和讨饭。解放后，在职工会领导下，组织了职工合作社，集股二十万元，大量购买棉花与纺花车，扶助家属妇女纺织。开始时，有些人还不愿纺织。矿工家属郝凤林，首先组织起一个七人纺织小组，合作社每人借给棉花二斤，纺车一架，在二十五天中，共纺花五十四斤，赚洋三千五百一十元。这一实际例子，鼓励了全矿家属，在三个月内，参加纺织的妇女即增至六百五十三人。随着纺织的发展，家属思想也有很大的进步，许多人认识了劳动的光荣，依靠自己劳动才能过好光景。现家属纺织仍在继续扩大中。"

According to Reuters, \"The conference ended on the evening of the 16th with the four foreign ministers shaking hands and toasting to the success of their next meeting.\" The foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States left Paris on the 17th to return to their countries. Before leaving, Bidault and Bevin held a 45-minute meeting to discuss the coal needs of France. Bevin also assured Bidault that he would re-examine the distribution of Ruhr coal based on the reasons he had presented. After a week of discussions, the conference partially resolved the treaty issues for Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. Partial agreement was also reached on issues such as the preamble, naval disposal, and reparations in the Italian issue. The main issues in the treaty, such as the Italo-Yugoslav border and colonial issues, remain unresolved. In the final meetings on the 15th and 16th, preliminary discussions on the German issue began. The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France suggested establishing a special committee to study the German issue and draft a peace treaty with Germany. Bidault also proposed convening a peace conference on Germany in November, which was rejected by Molotov. On the 13th, TASS described Bidault's plan as clearly likely to give new hope to the aggressive elements within Germany who are now trying to raise their heads. At the close of the conference, it was decided that all unresolved issues would be left to the deputies of the foreign ministers to continue studying in Paris during the foreign ministers' recess, so that they could be presented at the next meeting. The first meeting of the deputies of the foreign ministers was scheduled for the 17th.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n巴黎  Paris\n四强外长会议  Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n延安  Yan'an\n路透社  Reuters\n贝纳斯  Bidault\n贝文  Bevin\n比道尔  Bidault\n鲁尔  Ruhr\n罗马尼亚  Romania\n保加利亚  Bulgaria\n匈牙利  Hungary\n芬兰  Finland\n意大利  Italy\n莫洛托夫  Molotov\n塔斯社  TASS\n苏联  Soviet Union\n英国  United Kingdom\n美国  United States\n南斯拉夫  Yugoslavia\n德国  Germany\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 巴黎会议暂告休会  未决问题留交各外长代表研究\n\n1946-05-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　巴黎会议暂告休会\n    未决问题留交各外长代表研究\n    【新华社延安十八日电】上月二十五日，在巴黎召开的四强外长会议，已于十六日暂告休会，定六月十五日在巴黎继续举行。据路透社称：“此次会议，十六日晚在四外长握手言欢，举杯庆祝他们下次会议成功声中结束”。苏英美三外长已于十七日离巴黎返国，行前贝纳斯、贝文曾与比道尔举行三刻钟会议，商讨法国所需煤炭问题。贝文并向比道尔保证，当根据他所提之理由重行审查鲁尔煤炭的分配情形。这次会议，经一周的讨论，已部分解决了对罗保匈芬的和约问题，对意大利问题中的序言、海军处理，及赔偿等问题，亦有部分同意。和约中的主要问题，如意南边境及殖民地问题等，仍未获解决。十五、六日最后数次会议上，对德国问题已开始作初步讨论，美英法三国外长曾建议设立一特别委员会，研究德国问题，并起草对德和约，贝纳斯并提议在十一月召开对德和会，均遭莫洛托夫的拒绝。十三日塔斯社对贝氏此一计划，描述为显系可能给予现在正试图抬头的德国境内侵犯分子以新希望。会议结束时，决定各项未决问题，留交外长代表在外长休会期间于巴黎继续研究，以便于下次会议中提出。各外长代表首次会议，则定十七日举行。"

    "content": "Children's Home\n    A Visit to the \"Welfare Nursery\" in Handan\n\n            Going to the Children's Home\n    I visited the \"Welfare Nursery\" outside the North Gate of Handan with a joyful heart.\n    When I gently pushed open the gate and passed through a section of the children's playground, I saw the children's close friends, Director Zhou, Instructor Li, and several other comrades in the room to the right. They were busy planning new construction for the nursery. I looked around. The swings, slides, and rocking boats in the yard, the tables, chairs, and benches in the room... everything was so small, clever, and lovable. The owners of these furnishings are now forty children aged two to six. I heard that the number will soon double, and later, infant classes will be added, even expanding to accommodate all the young children. Let us eagerly anticipate that day.\n    A few days before my visit, some of the children had measles. Most of those who hadn't contracted measles were temporarily taken back by their parents, and they are only now being sent back one after another. Although there are not many children, their voices are everywhere. A group of children surrounded a little girl calling her \"sister.\" I heard she is the class leader of their kindergarten class (three to six years old). She helped up a child who had fallen and then sat quietly in the corner, humming a little tune happily. Below her are three group leaders, each leading three members. \"This is a method we came up with through trial and error,\" Director Zhou explained. When they started in early March, there were few children, and it was easy to manage. Later, as the number of children increased, it became difficult. There were quarrels, sleeping in, even smashing glass and urinating everywhere. After thinking it over, they came up with this grouping and competition method. The children were extremely happy. Everyone wanted to \"wear a little red flower on their chest\" and they all became well-behaved. Xiao Lin used to sleep in, but now that she is a group leader, she doesn't sleep in anymore. Xiao Lei, who didn't talk, also started talking. Jihua voluntarily helps the little brothers and sisters in the infant class put on their socks and is willing to sing and dance in front of everyone. Jianguo, who was afraid of class, now shouts in a high-pitched voice when he hears the bell: \"Class is starting!\" When he needs to urinate, he stands up respectfully and says: \"Report, I need to go to the restroom!\"... This group of innocent and cheerful children, from an early age, develop a habit of unity, mutual assistance, and love of the group. In the future collective cause of the people, there is no doubt that they will play a greater role.\n\n            Children Growing Up in War\n    The children here share the common characteristics of all children in the liberated areas behind enemy lines: they are all conceived and raised in war and disaster. Moreover, their parents insisted on the anti-Japanese struggle under the fire of cannons in the past, and now they are still wholeheartedly dedicated to the cause of people's peace and democracy. From a general humanitarian point of view alone, society should first nurture and raise this group of children well.\n    When we walked to the door of the children's canteen in the backyard (now an isolation room for thirteen children with measles), the children who had begun to recover their health were all vying to press their faces against the glass window, staring at us with wide eyes. With the doctor's permission, we pushed the door open and went in. Five-year-old Li Yang, sitting on a small wooden bed with railings, greeted Instructor Li, saying: \"Mom, who is this?\" After his mother's introduction, Little Li Yang immediately called me \"Uncle Du, Comrade Du\" very affectionately. He also asked me if I knew his uncle, why his uncle didn't come to see him, etc. His mother said: \"Uncle is in the Northeast, and the Kuomintang are fighting them!\" Little Li Yang became unhappy and pouted, saying: \"The Kuomintang are really bad guys! They are wholeheartedly fighting a civil war!\" This five-year-old life has already survived six or seven major \"mopping-up\" operations and raids by the enemy, and also survived a severe famine in the guerrilla areas. When he was born, his mother ate black beans and had no milk to feed him. Only six days later, they encountered an enemy \"mopping-up\" operation. At that time, his father was busy commanding the troops to fight, leaving his tired mother to hide him in the mountains of western Hebei. When he was thirsty, he drank the stinky water in the pit. As a result, the child began to develop malaria. During the great famine of 1943, he also suffered from kala-azar. After the battle, his mother had to continue to work as usual, and the child fell off the kang, cried until he was full, and then fell asleep, covered in dirt.... Little Li Yang grew up in this environment. His little neighbor, Hong Qi, also had the same experience. Now Little Hong Qi can vaguely remember the enemy's major \"mopping-up\" operation in May 1943. The wet nurse was killed, and he and his sister (the wet nurse's daughter) hid in the firewood. The enemy shook their bayonets and roared, but they didn't find them. Later, he followed his father and mother and lived near the enemy's Laoding Mountain stronghold in Changzhi for a year and a half, and recognized four godmothers. When the enemy set out, his father and mother both went to fight, leaving Little Hong Qi to live with his godmothers...\n    As he spoke, a child rushed in, and all the children began to sing in unison: \"Xiao Dongping, you're so naughty, you broke the glass and that's not all...\". This is Commander Chen of the First Column's child. In the worst years (June 1941), he grew up on the turbulent plains of southern Hebei, which made him develop a rough and uninhibited character. The responsibility for this certainly lies with the brutal Japanese fascists, but the past is finally over. The nurturing of these children of cadres who have suffered all kinds of devastation and torture and who have contributed to the country and the nation should be everyone's responsibility. This question lingered in my mind for a long time, and today it has begun to be resolved. Moreover, I firmly believe that with the support of our democratic government and everyone, the childcare cause in our liberated areas will develop greatly.\n\n            Pure Calls\n    In the nursery, there is one thing that I dare not ask more about, nor dare to think about it too much. Really, who would believe that among these innocent, identically jumping children, there could be any misfortune? However, the reality is so cruel and ruthless! We can mention less about the children who lost their parents in the War of Resistance Against Japan, but today, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionaries are using the fire of civil war to forcibly take away the children's parents! Reason compels me to make a pure call for the children: \"We don't want civil war! We don't want civil war!!\" Three-year-old Li Xiaozhong, whenever he sees his mother and thinks of his father, his mother tells him with tears in her eyes: \"Your father was killed by the Kuomintang reactionaries!\" This eternal hatred has been deeply etched in this young heart! Now the Kuomintang reactionaries' civil war cannon fire is aimed at the Northeast, the Central Plains, and eastern Henan... Many children's fathers are there. Let us once again make a pure call for the children: \"We don't want civil war! We don't want civil war!!\"\n    The children's close friends, Director Zhou, Instructor Li, and other comrades working in the nursery, have repeatedly talked about this issue and expressed their willingness to devote themselves to the childcare cause of the revolutionary descendants. Regarding this, I have also heard the same expressions at the Taihang Nursery. Because they are all motherhood who have come through war and disaster, they understand the importance of childcare and will do this work very well. And they have only one request: in addition to the government's fixed quota of funds, they hope that all parties will give them more help. They need other things, especially medicines, and they still need a large sum of construction funds. Now, let me record these words spoken from the mouths of the children's friends here and forward them to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, as well as all social charitable organizations and people who are enthusiastic about public welfare.\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n中国    China\n邯郸    Handan\n冀西    Western Hebei\n长治    Changzhi\n太行    Taihang\n东北    Northeast\n中原    Central Plains\n豫东    Eastern Henan\n冀南    Southern Hebei\n周所长 Zhou Suozhang\n黎指导员 Li Zhidanyuan\n黎洋    Li Yang\n红骑    Hong Qi\n陈司令员 Commander Chen\n李小中    Li Xiaozhong\n杜叔叔    Uncle Du\n杜同志    Comrade Du\n\n福利托儿所  Welfare Nursery\n幼儿之家    Children's Home\n幼稚班    Kindergarten Class\n联合国救济总署  United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration\n第一纵队  First Column\n黑热病   Kala-azar\n\n抗日战争    War of Resistance Against Japan\n国民党反动派 Kuomintang reactionaries\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 幼儿之家  邯郸“福利托儿所”访问记\n展潮\n1946-05-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　幼儿之家\n    邯郸“福利托儿所”访问记\n            到幼儿之家去\n    我怀着喜悦的心情，去拜访了邯郸北门外的“福利托儿所”。\n    当我轻轻推开栅门，通过一段孩子们的游戏场之后，在右面的耳室里便见到幼儿们的挚友，周所长、黎指导员和另外几位同志，他们正忙着筹划所里新的建设。我纵目四望，院子里的秋千、滑梯、摇船，屋子里的桌椅、板凳……一切都是那么矮小伶俐得可爱。这些家具的主人，现在是四十个二至六周岁的幼儿。听说，不久将要增加到一倍，以后，还要增设乳儿班，甚至一直扩大到能收容所有的幼儿。让我们热情地期待着这么一天吧。\n    我去的前几天，有一部分小孩害麻疹病，没有害麻疹的，大多由父母暂时领回去，现在才陆续送来。小孩虽然不多，却到处都是他们的声音，一群幼儿围着叫“姐姐”的那个小女孩，听说是他们幼稚班（三周岁至六周岁）的班长，她把一个跌倒的幼儿搀起来，便又温文地坐在屋角里，愉快地哼着小曲。在她下面有三个小组长，每个组长带领三个组员，“这也是从摸索中想出来的办法”，周所长解释着说。他们三月初创办的时候，小孩少，好管理，后来孩子们越来越多，便不好办了，不是吵架，便是睡懒觉，甚至砸玻璃、乱撒尿。想来想去，便想出这个编组，比赛的办法，孩子们真高兴极了，谁都愿意把“一朵朵红花挂在胸前”，都学乖了。小琳过去好睡懒觉，现在当了小组长，不睡懒觉啦。不讲话的小磊也讲话啦。继华自动替婴儿班的小弟弟，小妹妹们穿袜子，也肯在大家面前唱歌跳舞啦。怕上课的建国，现在一听到钟声，便尖着嗓子喊：“上课罗！”要撒尿的时候，便规规矩矩地站起来说：“报告，我要上茅房！”……这群天真烂漫的孩子，从小便养成一种团结互助爱群的习惯，在未来人民的集体事业中，毫无疑问，他们是会起到更大的作用的。\n            在战争中生长的孩子们\n    这里的幼儿，有着所有敌后解放区孩子们共同的特点，都是在战争和灾难中孕育生长的。并且他们的父母过去在炮火下坚持了抗日斗争，现在也还是全心意地献身在人民和平民主的事业里。就单就一般的人道观点来说，也要求社会首先把这批幼儿养育好。\n    当我们走到后院的幼儿食堂门口（现在是十三个害麻疹幼儿的隔离室），已经开始恢复健康的孩子们，都争着把脸贴到玻璃窗上，睁大着眼睛在看我们。经过医生的允许，我们推门进去。五周岁的黎洋，坐在装着栏栅的小木床上招呼着黎指导员说：“妈妈，这是谁？”经过他妈妈的介绍，小黎洋马上就很亲昵地“杜叔叔，杜同志”地呼唤着我。还问我知不知道他伯伯，他伯伯为什么不来看他等等，他母亲说：“伯伯在东北，国民党正打他们呢！”小黎洋便不高兴起来了，努着嘴说：“国民党，真坏蛋！一心一意打内战！”这五周岁的小生命，却已渡过敌人六七次的大“扫荡”和奔袭，又曾在游击区里渡过了严重的荒年。他出生的时候，母亲吃着黑豆，没有奶喂他，才六天便碰到敌人的“扫荡”，那时父亲忙着指挥队伍打仗，只丢下劳累的母亲把他藏在冀西的大山里，渴了便喝着坑里的臭水，这样，小孩子便开始发起虐疾来。四三年大灾荒的时候，还害过一场黑热病。打罢仗，母亲又要照常的忙碌着工作，孩子便从炕上跌下来，哭饱了又睡去，弄得混身是土。……小黎洋就是在这种环境下生长起来的。他的小邻居红骑，也和他有着同样的经历。现在小红骑还能模糊记得，敌人四三年五月的大“扫荡”，奶娘被杀死了，他和姐姐（奶娘的女孩）躲在柴里，敌人晃着刺刀咕噜噜地吼叫，却没有找到他们。后来便随着爸爸和妈妈，在长治敌人老顶山据点附近住了一年半，认了四个干娘，敌人出发的时候，爸爸和妈妈都打仗去了，留下小红骑跟干娘过活。……\n    说着说着，一个孩子闯进来了，所有的小孩便都齐唱起来：“小东平，真捣蛋，打了玻璃还不算………”。这是一纵队陈司令员的小孩，严重的年份里（四一年六月），他生长在动荡的冀南平原上，使他养成一副粗野放任的性格，这责任固然在于残暴的日本法西斯身上，但是过去终于是过去了，对于这些受尽摧残和折磨的功在国家民族的干部孩子们的抚育，应该是大家的责任，这问题长久地在我脑子里萦绕着，今天已开始得到解决。并且，我坚信在我们民主政府和大家支持下，我们解放区的保育事业，将会大大地发展的起来。\n            纯真的呼喊\n    在托儿所里，有一件事使我不敢多问，也不敢多去想它。真的，谁敢相信在这些天真无邪一式一样地跳跃着的幼儿里，还有什么不幸呢？然而，现实却是那样地残酷无情！在抗日战争中失去父母的孩子，我们可以不多提了，但是抗战胜利后的今天，国民党反动派却用内战的炮火，强夺去孩子们的双亲！理性驱使我，要为孩子们作一次纯真的呼喊：“我们不要内战！我们不要内战！！”三周岁的李小中，每当看到他妈妈的时候，联想到他爸爸，母亲便含泪地告诉他：“爸爸是国民党反动派杀死的！”这个永恒的仇恨，已经深深地刻划在这稚小的心灵里！现在国民党反动派内战的炮火，正对准东北、中原和豫东………好多孩子们的父亲，就在那里，让我们再替孩子们作一次纯真的呼喊：“我们不要内战！我们不要内战！！”\n    幼儿们的挚友——周所长，黎指导员和托儿所其他的工作同志，好几次都谈到这个问题，并且表示她们愿意为革命后代的保育事业而献身。关于这，我在太行保育院那里也听到过同样的表示。因为她们都是从战争与灾难中过来的母性，她们懂得保育事业的重要，也会把这工作作得很好。而她们只有一个要求：除政府定额经费外，希望各方面多多给予她们以帮助。她们需要别的东西，尤其需要药品，她们还得用一大笔建设费。现在，让我把这些从幼儿挚友们嘴里说出来的话，记录在这里，一并转给联合国救济总署，以及一切社会慈善机关和热心公益事业的人们吧。"

Each institute has a director and a clerk. Prisoners are not subject to restraints; minor offenders can move freely, while serious offenders are only allowed to move indoors. Their families are free to visit. Prisoners are divided into groups, and group leaders are democratically elected by the prisoners themselves to lead the prisoners in production and study. Prisoners' livelihood is self-sufficient through production. The Jinnan Bank has provided a loan of one million yuan as a production fund for the Self-Renewal Institutes. The Self-Renewal Institute of the Fourth Prefectural Administrative Office's Judicial Section was established on March 20th and currently has twenty ordinary criminal offenders, divided into two classes with a total of four groups. They spend two hours each day on reflection and study, six hours on production, and the remaining time on free labor. The study focuses on current affairs, literacy, and education to inspire prisoners to consciously recognize their mistakes. In terms of production, three people are engaged in farming, planting 24 mu of cotton; 14 people are engaged in handicrafts such as weaving straw hats, carving wooden seals, painting, and adobe making. Cadres and prisoners jointly established a production committee to uniformly plan and lead production. Furthermore, prisoners at the Wucheng Self-Renewal Institute have also organized production groups for adobe housing construction, sheep herding, textile production, and salt extraction. In addition to improving their living standards, they have a surplus of 15,329 yuan. Since the establishment of the Self-Renewal Institutes, prisoner education has achieved great results, with no one escaping. This demonstrates the fundamental difference between prisons under the management of the democratic government and the dark and brutal prisons under the management of the Kuomintang.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n地方    Place\n冀南    Jinnan\n威县    Weixian\n武城    Wucheng\n\n组织机构  Organization\n冀南行署  Jinnan Administrative Office\n村监狱    Village Prison\n冀南银行  Jinnan Bank\n四专署司法科自新院  The Self-Renewal Institute of the Fourth Prefectural Administrative Office's Judicial Section\n国民党  Kuomintang\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 把监狱变成学校  冀南各专县设自新院  犯人生产学习武城无一人逃亡\n\n1946-05-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　把监狱变成学校\n    冀南各专县设自新院\n    犯人生产学习武城无一人逃亡\n    【本报威县讯】冀南行署为加强对刑事案犯之管理，教育改造犯人思想，通令各级政府司法机关设立自新院。现各县已有建立完竣或正建立中之自新院，收容一年以上之徒刑犯（不满一年者在村监狱由村群众监督执行徒刑），内设院长，事务员各一人。犯人一律不带刑具，轻犯可自由行动，重犯只许在屋内行动，其家属可自由接见。犯人均划编小组，由犯人自己民主选出小组长，领导犯人生产学习。犯人生活由生产中自给。冀南银行已贷款百万元作自新院之生产基金。四专署司法科自新院是三月二十日建立的，现已有二十名普通刑事犯，编为两班，共四组，每天规定反省、学习各两小时，生产六小时，余时自由劳作。学习方面主要是时事、文化及启发犯人自觉认识自己错误的教育。生产方面现已有三人从事农作，种棉花二十四亩；十四人从事于编草帽、刻木章、绘画、脱坯等手工业，干部及犯人共同成立了生产委员会，统一筹划领导生产。又武城自新院犯人也组织了脱坯盖房、牧羊、纺织、淋盐等生产小组，除改善生活外，尚余一万五千三百二十九元。从自新院建立后，犯人教育收到很大的成绩，无一人逃跑，此即民主政府管理下的监狱，与国民党管理下的黑暗残酷的监狱有天地之别。"

This is the first time in the history of the Japanese parliament that truly representative voices of the people can be heard. On the first day of the parliamentary session, about 5,000 Japanese railway workers staged a demonstration outside the Diet building, which interrupted the meeting for a time. When electing the speaker, the Japanese Communist Party members and the left-wing members of the Socialist Party united to compete for the position of speaker. When the reactionary Liberal Party, under the pretext that the Japanese Communist Party had few seats, presumptuously claimed that it was \"not qualified\" to be the speaker, Tokuda sternly refuted it, saying, \"We represent the interests of 90% of the entire population.\" However, because the reactionary faction occupied the vast majority of seats in the parliament, the speaker was usurped by Miki from the Liberal Party, and the vice-speaker was seized by Kimura from the Progressive Party. During the discussion of the agenda, the Japanese Communist Party proposed to first discuss the lives of 15 million famine victims, and specifically pointed out the relief plan, demanding that national warehouses and imperial family rice reserves be immediately distributed to the famine victims.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n日本    Ribeng\n日本人民代表    Japanese people's representatives\n日共    Rigon (Japanese Communist Party)\n冈野进  Okano Susumu\n德田球一   Tokuda Kyuichi\n志贺义雄   Shiga Yoshio\n东京    Tokyo\n新华社   Xinhua News Agency\n延安    Yan'an\n日本大选   Japanese general election\n国会大厦    Diet building\n社会党    Socialist Party\n自由党    Liberal Party\n三木    Miki\n木村   Kimura\n进步党    Progressive Party\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 日共首次出席新议会  提议开放全国粮库救济饥民\n\n1946-05-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　日共首次出席新议会\n    提议开放全国粮库救济饥民\n    【新华社延安十九日电】东京讯：五位日本人民代表、日共领袖冈野进、德田球一、志贺义雄等，于十六日首次出席日本大选后新议会的揭幕典礼，这是日本议会有史以来第一次开始能听到真正代表人民利益的呼声。议会第一天开会时，日铁路工人约五千人，曾在国会大厦外作示威游行，会议曾因此一度中断。在选举议长时，日共议员与社会党左派议员，即联合起来争取议长职位，当反动派自由党借口日共议席少，妄言“无资格”任议长时，德田即予以严正驳斥道：“我们代表着占全人口百分之九十的人民利益”，但终于因反动派窃居议会绝大多数席位，因此议长由自由党的三木，副议长由进步党的木村霸占。在讨论议事日程时，日共提出首先讨论救济一千五百万饥民的生活，并具体指出救济方案，要求立即发放全国仓库与皇室存米给饥民。"

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "【Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 7th】 The Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee has readjusted its administrative organization and principles of economic management, and decided as follows: (A) Administrative divisions: (1) The Border Region is divided into five administrative districts, namely, the provincial governments of Chahar and Rehe, and the administrative offices of three regions: Central Hebei, Jin-Sui, and Eastern Hebei. The entire Border Region is reorganized into nineteen special districts, and a total of five special districts are abolished. (2) All localities should restore the old county governance from before the war. Those that need to be governed separately due to natural conditions may establish county public offices, but must be approved by the Border Region Government Committee. (3) The districts (the area between the county and village) in the old liberated areas should be appropriately expanded, and the districts in the edge areas of the newly liberated areas can be smaller. The work of reducing the number of districts must be completed by the end of May. (B) Organizational structure: (1) Determining that counties and provinces are local autonomous units, it is necessary to strengthen the organizational structures of the provincial administrative offices and counties, while also strengthening various construction departments and reducing departments that were adapted to wartime but now have little work. (2) Determining that the special commissioner's office will be an auxiliary organ of the future administrative office or provincial government, the organization is scaled down. Each administrative office and provincial government will directly lead and control the counties from now on. (3) After the expansion of the district, the division of labor of the district assistants, except for the security officer and the assistant in charge of preferential treatment for soldiers' families and veteran rehabilitation work, should generally be divided according to the region. The village regime must be further improved to give full play to its role. (4) In large market towns with developed commerce, a population of more than 10,000, or located on important transportation routes, township public offices should be established, directly led by the county, to carry out government work and prosper the market town economy. (5) The establishment of governments at all levels stipulates that the administrative office and provincial government generally have 150 people, the special commissioner's office has 30 people, the county government has an average of 100 people (including police and judicial custodial personnel), and the district public office has an average of 9 people. Counties and districts can be divided into first, second, and third classes according to the actual situation, and then different establishments can be specified separately. (6) In order to unify and strengthen the management of finance and economy, the Border Region Government Committee will set up special financial and economic commissioner offices in each administrative region. The establishment includes one special financial and economic commissioner, three secretaries and staff members. Their duties are to represent the Border Region Government Committee in the unified management of the various financial and economic organizations and business departments of the Border Region Government Committee stationed in the administrative region. (C) Work responsibilities: (1) Handicraft and small industries should be operated by cooperatives as much as possible, or private individuals should be mobilized to operate them, and the government should provide guidance and assistance in terms of policy. Larger factories and mines, except for a few operated by the Border Region Government Committee, should mostly be jointly operated by public and private entities, or transferred to private individuals for operation, and enterprise and rationalization should be implemented. The government only provides guidance in terms of policy. Each administrative office and province below it will temporarily not establish factory management agencies. Transportation and postal services are uniformly managed by the Border Region Government Committee. In areas with a lot of telecommunications work (including telephone and telegraph), a bureau can be set up for special management; in areas with less work, the industrial departments of the government will manage it. In areas with long highways, a highway bureau can be established; in areas with short highways, the industrial departments of the government will manage it. (2) The grain work is gradually uniformly controlled by the Border Region. Trade policies and trade administration are controlled by the financial departments of governments at all levels. (3) Social education is mainly the responsibility of the county level, mainly to run vocational schools, normal schools, and secondary schools.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n晋察冀边委会  Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Government Committee\n察哈尔省  Chahar Province\n热河省  Rehe Province\n冀中行署区  Jizhong (Central Hebei) Administrative Office Region\n冀晋行署区  Jijin (Jin-Sui) Administrative Office Region\n冀东行署区  Jidong (Eastern Hebei) Administrative Office Region\n新华社   Xinhua News Agency\n张家口   Zhangjiakou\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋察冀边委会决定  重整行政组织机构  加强统一财经管理\n\n1946-05-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋察冀边委会决定\n    重整行政组织机构\n    加强统一财经管理\n    【新华社张家口七日电】晋察冀边区行政委员会重新调整行政组织机构及经济管理原则，决定如下：（甲）行政区划：（一）边区划分为五个行政区。即察哈尔、热河两省政府，冀中、冀晋、冀东三个行署区。全边区重新划分为十九个专区，共撤销五个专区。（二）各地一律恢复战前旧县治。因其受自然条件限制，而须分治者，可成立县公署，但须经边委会批准。（三）老解放区的区（县村之间的区），应适当扩大，新解放区边缘地区的区划可较小。此项减少区数的工作，务于五月底完成。（乙）组织编制：（一）确定县省为地方自治单位，因之须加强省行署，县的组织机构，同时加强各建设部门，裁减适应战时而现在工作不多的部门。（二）确定专署今后的行署或省府的辅助机关，组织缩小。各行署省府，今后要直接领导掌握到县。（三）区划大以后，区助理员的分工除治安员及专管优抗复员工作的助理员外，一般应按地区分工。村政权须更加健全，使其高度发挥作用。（四）在商业发达，人口有一万以上或位于交通要道的大集镇，设市镇公所，由县直接领导，以执行政权工作，繁荣集镇经济。（五）各级政权的编制，规定行署、省府一般的为一百五十人，专署为三十人，县府平均一百人（包括警察及司法看守人员），区公所平均九人，县区均可按实际情形划分为一、二、三等，再分别规定不同的编制。（六）为统一与加强财政经济的管理，边委会在各行政区设置财经特派员办事处，其编制为财经特派员一人，秘书、干事三人，其职权为代表边委会统一管理边委会驻在该行政区内的各财经组织和企业部门。（丙）工作职权：（一）手工业及小的工业，应尽量由合作社经营，或发动私人经营，政府在政策上加以指导与帮助。较大的工厂矿山，除少数由边委会经营外，大部分应公私合营，或让与私人经营，并实行企业化、合理化，政府仅在政策方面加以指导。各行署省以下，均暂不建立工厂专管机关。交通与邮政，由边委会统一管理。在电讯（包括电话、电报）工作多的地区，可设局专管；工作少的地区，即由政府实业部门管理。公路长的地区，可设立公路局，少的地区，由政府实业部门管理。（二）粮食工作逐渐由边区统一掌握。贸易政策及贸易行政，均由各级政府财政部门掌握。（三）社会教育主要由县级负责掌握，主要是办理职业学校、师范学校、中等学校。"

    "content": "A Visit with General Lin Biao\n    (New China News Agency Special Correspondent Liu Baiyu)\n    One clear morning last month, in the courtyard of a village, this reporter met with General Lin Biao, the outstanding military strategist who is fervently supported by hundreds of thousands of officers and soldiers of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army – their commander-in-chief. Dressed in a plain yellow military uniform and cloth shoes, he calmly and resolutely told the reporter: \"The reactionaries have not abandoned their attempts to attack. They have used their most elite New First Army here, but they were eliminated and frustrated south of Sipingjie. This was very unexpected for them, because their estimate was wrong – they thought we were incapable of fighting defensive battles. Now, the front lines are facing each other with fortifications, only fifty meters apart. You can hear the other side talking. I think they will concentrate aircraft, artillery, and tanks to launch a new offensive. However, our defending troops have been tempered in many days of fierce fighting. We hope the enemy attacks, because we feel this will give the invading army more lessons.\n    Those who have been promoting and touting the New First Army should now feel ashamed. When they came to the Northeast to carry out an anti-democratic and anti-peace civil war, they hit a hard nail. They once set a deadline to occupy Sipingjie by April 2nd, believing that it would only take two days to get from Changtu to Sipingjie, and that they would reach Changchun by April 5th. In reality, this 120-li road from Sipingjie to Changchun has already taken them more than a month, and the Kuomintang army is still hesitating outside Siping City. Now Sipingjie is a city where all the glass has been shattered, and the dense artillery fire is deafening. In order to seize a twenty-meter high ground in the north, the invaders' corpses cover the green grass. In the first fifteen days, they attacked dozens of times, charging over a hundred times, but the defenders there remained unmoved, as steady as Mount Tai. The New First Army suffered 3,000 casualties and prisoners. It's still like what the old folks in Sipingjie say: 'You can see it, but you can't get in'!\"\n    General Lin Biao affirmed: \"Our morale is very high, our spirit of attack is strong, and we are capable of dealing blows to the reactionaries. The enemy's spirit is gradually waning in fatigue. They fear our army's surprise attacks, bayonet charges, and outflanking maneuvers.\"\n    General Lin Biao was the commander of the famous Pingxingguan battle eight years ago. This time, he is contributing everything to protect the freedom, democracy, and survival of the people of the Northeast. He likes to go to the front lines, but he knows that all wars are mainly determined by ordinary preparations. He doesn't talk much on the front lines, but calmly observes everything and helps commanders sum up experience to guide new actions. Because his summation of experience is targeted at the enemy's strengths and weaknesses, there have been new creations in tactics. These superior tactics have reduced the losses of the Democratic Allied Army and completed several large and small annihilation battles.\n    One of General Lin Biao's characteristics is to grasp the center, and then to do extremely deep and meticulous thinking around it, and then to test it in practice. He is a fervent reader of theoretical books. Shortly after he first arrived in the Northeast, he spent several days on the front lines carefully studying \"Rectification Documents,\" especially Chairman Mao's \"Rural Survey,\" which he read after the Xiushuihezi battle. Although military affairs are very busy, he still pays great attention to rural surveys. He sent his only secretary and the head of the Third Section to the countryside to do survey work, and told them in detail what problems to solve, to organize peasants in their struggle, to collect materials, and to understand the peasant problems of the Northeast. When the troops rest, he mobilizes everyone to do mass work.\n    In the past six months, General Lin Biao has traveled through the large plains near Jinzhou, Xinmin, Zhangwu, Faku, Fushun, and Sipingjie. In military terms, it can be roughly divided into two stages. In the first period, the reactionaries came with arrogant greed. The people of the Northeast had just been liberated from fourteen years of enemy and puppet long-term oppression. Enemy and puppet remnants were creating chaos in the rear. During this period, the Democratic Allied Army mainly focused on eliminating enemy and puppet remnants, mobilizing the masses, strengthening and expanding the people's self-defense forces, and establishing base areas. Since the battle of Xiushuihezi on February 16th, the Kuomintang army was defeated greatly, but still launched a larger and more frenzied full-scale offensive against the people of the Northeast. This began the second period. Entering this period, the people of the Northeast have been initially organized, and the Democratic Allied Army has established four military regions: Jihei, Jiliao, Liaodong, and Rehe-Liao. Most enemy and puppet remnants and bandits have been eliminated. In the self-defense war, the reactionaries suffered 15,000 dead and wounded, and more than 10,000 were captured.\n    \"Peace is a definite prospect,\" General Lin Biao said, \"but we must prevent these reactionaries from being able to attack the people. Now we advocate a truce, which American friends and democrats also seem to advocate. We welcome that; but it must be recognized that as long as the reactionaries can continue to fight, they will definitely continue to fight. However, they will continue to be miserably defeated in front of the people. It is impossible to implement dictatorship and autocracy in the Northeast. An army that is separated from the masses loses its soul. This is the situation of the Kuomintang army; when they are combined, the situation improves. This is the situation of the Democratic Allied Army. I still hope that the Kuomintang authorities can stop the civil war, realize peace and democracy, and give the people of the Northeast full freedom and rights.\"\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    China\n东北民主联军    Northeast Democratic Allied Army\n林彪  Lin Biao\n新一军  New First Army\n四平街  Sipingjie\n昌图  Changtu\n长春  Changchun\n平型关大战  Pingxingguan Battle\n毛泽东  Mao Zedong\n整风文献  Rectification Documents\n农村调查  Rural Survey\n秀水河子战役    Xiushuihezi battle\n锦州  Jinzhou\n新民  Xinmin\n彰武  Zhangwu\n法库  Faku\n抚顺  Fushun\n吉黑  Jihei\n吉辽  Jiliao\n辽东  Liaodong\n热辽  Rehe-Liao\n国民党    Kuomintang\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 林彪将军访问记\n刘白羽\n1946-05-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　林彪将军访问记\n    （新华社特派记者刘白羽）\n    在上月间一个晴朗的早晨，记者在一处村庄的庭院里，会晤了为东北民主联军数十万指战员所热忱拥戴的卓越的军事战略家——他们的总司令林彪将军，他穿着黄色普通军服，番布鞋子，沉静坚毅的面对着记者说：“反动派没有放弃进攻的企图，他们在这里使用了他们最精锐的新一军，可是他们在四平街以南就受到消灭和挫折，这很出乎他们的意外，因为他们估计是错误了——他们认为我们是不能打防御战的。现在在前线彼此工事对峙，距离只五十米，对方讲话都听得到，我想他们还要以飞机、大炮、坦克集中发动新攻势，不过我们守城部队在多日激战中，已锻炼出来了，我们希望敌人进攻，觉得这样可以使进犯军多得到些教训。\n    现在那些为新一军宣传吹嘘的人，应该感到羞耻了，当他们到东北进行反民主和平的内战的时候，已碰了硬钉子。他们曾经限令四月二日占领四平街、认为从昌图到四平街只要两天，而在四月五日赶到长春。实际上，这条从四平街到长春的一百二十里路，已经走了一个多月了，国民党军仍踯躅四平城外。现在四平街是一个所有玻璃都震碎了的城，在那里密集的炮声，使人耳聋。为着争夺北面一块二十米的高地，进犯者的尸体盖满了绿草。在前十五日当中，他们进攻数十次，冲锋一百次以上，但那里的保卫者屹然不动，稳如泰山，新一军伤亡及被俘者三千人。现在还是如四平街老百姓所说的：“看得见，进不来”！\n    林彪将军肯定地说：“我们的士气很高，攻击精神很旺，能够给反动派以打击。敌人的锐气在疲惫中逐渐减消了，他们惧怕我军的偷袭、拚刺刀和迂回”。\n    林彪将军是八年前著名的平型关大战的指挥者，这次他为了保卫东北人民的自由民主和生存而贡献他的一切，他喜欢到火线上去，但是他知道一切战争主要决定于平常的准备，他在火线上不多讲话，而是冷静的观察一切，并帮助指挥员总结经验，以指导新的行动。由于他的总结经验针对敌方的优缺点，在战术上有了新的创造，这优越的战术，使民主联军减少了损失，而完成了若干大大小小的歼灭战。\n    林彪将军的特点之一，是掌握着中心，而后围绕着它去做极深刻细致的思考，然后到实际中去考验。他是理论书籍的热狂的读者，在他初到东北不久时，在前线上他有几天把“整风文献”仔细钻研，特别是毛主席的“农村调查”，就是在秀水河子战役后读的。军务虽然十分繁忙，但他仍极注意农村调查，他把身边唯一的秘书和三科长派到农村去做调查工作，并详细告诉他们要解决些什么问题，要组织农民在他们斗争中来，收集材料，了解东北的农民问题。当部队休息下来的时候，他发动大家去做群众工作。\n    半年以来，林彪将军走过锦州、新民、彰武、法库、抚顺和四平街附近一带的大平原，在军事上可以大致划分为两个阶段。第一个时期，那时反动派带着狂妄的贪欲而来，东北人民刚从十四年敌伪长期压迫下解放，后方敌伪残余捣乱，这一时期民主联军主要为肃清敌伪残余，发动群众，加强与扩大人民的自卫力量，建立了根据地。自从二月十六日秀水河子一战，国民党军大败，但仍更大规模更疯狂的向东北人民全面进攻，这就开始了第二个时期。进入这一时期，东北人民已初步组织起来，民主联军已建立了吉黑、吉辽、辽东、热辽四个军区，大部敌伪残余和土匪都被肃清。在自卫战争中，使反动派受到毙伤一万五千人，俘掳万余人。\n    “和平是确定的前途”，林彪将军说：“但必须使这些反动派不能够进攻人民。现在我们主张停战，就是美国朋友和民主人士听说也有同样主张，我们是欢迎的；但是要认识，反动派只要能打下去，他一定要打下去的。不过他在人民面前将会不断的惨败，想来东北实行独裁专制，是不可能的。军队如果离开群众，就失去了灵魂，这是国民党军的情形；一结合起来，情形就会上长，这是民主联军的情形。我还是希望国民党当局能够停止内战，实现和平民主，给东北人民以充分的自由与权利。”"

    "content": "[Changzhi News] The masses in the old liberated area of Wuxiang are currently enthusiastically supporting the production of the masses in the new areas. The Wuxiang Democratic Government, based on the resolution of the county council at the beginning of the month, actively led this movement and issued a call to the people of the old liberated area to support the new areas, in order to solve the production difficulties of the masses in more than a hundred villages located on both sides of the Baijin Railway. This area has suffered from the destruction of the enemy and puppets for eight years, and most of the villages have become no-man's-lands. After the ceasefire order, it was repeatedly attacked by the Japanese and Yan's army, resulting in scorched earth for miles and abandonment. Without the assistance of the old liberated area, it would be difficult for the surviving people to carry out production. Therefore, when the democratic government allocated a large amount of grain for emergency relief, transferred 150 head of livestock from the old liberated area, and organized a large number of people to pull plows to provide support, the local people rekindled the hope of self-reliance in production out of gratitude. In the past week, the support movement in Wuxiang County has formed a upsurge. The first and second districts alone have raised 45 shih of seeds, and support teams from other districts are also pulling donkeys and carrying plows, heading to the new areas in a continuous stream.\n    [Our Newspaper Changzhi News] After the masses in the Mafang District of Heshun were mobilized by the government last winter to raise clothing and food for relief, the masses spontaneously organized winter production and survived the winter famine.

Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Region Government, based on the discussions at the conference, made a concluding speech, which pointed out that the coal reserves on both the east and west sides of Taihang are extremely rich. Some mining areas have already adopted new mining methods, enabling the output of mines to gradually exceed the level during the enemy-occupied period. Jiao Zuo has even caught up to the pre-war level. Therefore, the future direction of coal industry development, for these large mining areas, should be to intensify the study of science and accumulate experience on the current basis, in order to move forward a step further and lay the foundation for the industrialization of the liberated areas. For semi-mechanized kilns scattered in various places, the main task is to accumulate capital, cultivate talent, and improve technology, preparing to develop towards mechanized kiln production methods. Large and small kilns should help each other and learn from each other, especially large kilns should frequently help the development of small kilns with talent and surplus machinery. In terms of coal industry management methods, most of the mines in the entire region adopt several methods: private operation, joint public-private operation, and cooperation between government organizations. In the future, we must develop towards enterprise-based and rationalized methods and must change the practices of being government organization-based and group-based. In the company's organizational leadership, we must do a better job of achieving strict division of labor, precise calculation, and fully exerting the role of \"everyone doing their best, everything being used, and every moment being valued.\" In terms of wages, industrial workers should be paid higher than rural workers, miners should be paid higher than general handicraft workers, machine workers' wages should generally be higher than manual workers, and specialized technical personnel should receive special treatment. Technical employees who concurrently serve as administrative cadres should receive both technical wages and a supplement of administrative staff salaries. During the eight-year war, the number of worker deaths was extremely large. In the future, the democratic government should work with trade unions and companies to recruit a large number of workers, and launch a campaign for demobilized soldiers to participate in industrial production in large numbers. Finally, everyone unanimously believed that the development of the coal industry in the border region in the future must implement the principle of labor-capital cooperation, so that workers' lives can be improved, coal capitalists can also benefit, and everyone can work together to double their efforts for the construction of the coal industry in the border region.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n太行      Taihang\n太岳      Taiyue\n磁县      Cixian County\n峰峰      Fengfeng\n焦作      Jiao Zuo\n戎副主席  Rong fù zhǔxí (Vice Chairman Rong)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 边区煤业会议上  戎副主席指示煤业方向  大窑小窑互相学习，提高技术，奠定工业化基础。\n\n1946-05-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　边区煤业会议上\n    戎副主席指示煤业方向\n    大窑小窑互相学习，提高技术，奠定工业化基础。\n    【本报讯】月初于磁县峰峰举行之边区煤业会议上，太行、太岳各矿区窑主、各职工代表，详细讨论了今后全区煤业发展中的诸问题。边区政府戎副主席，并根据大会讨论作了总结发言，该总结指出：太行东西两侧，煤藏极富，有些矿区已使用新式开采法，使矿山生产量，逐渐超过敌占时水平，焦作并已赶上战前水平。因之今后煤业发展方向，对这些大矿区，应在目前的基础上，加紧学习科学，积累经验，以更向前提高一步，奠定解放区工业化的基础。对散布各地的半机器窑，则主要是积蓄资本，培养人材，提高技术，准备向机器窑生产方式发展，大窑小窑两窑应互相帮助，互相学习，特别是大窑应经常以人材、剩余机器帮助小窑的发展。在煤业经营方式上，全区大部矿山，都是采取私营、公私合营与机关团体合作经营几种方式。今后更要向企业化合理化方面发展，必须改变机关化，团体化的作法。在公司组织领导上，更好的作到严密分工，精确计算，充分发挥“人尽其能，物尽其用，时尽其值”的作用。在工资方面，产业工人应高于农村工人，矿工应高于一般手工业工人，机器工人工资，一般应高于劳力工人，专门技术人材，应有特别待遇，部分兼任行政干部的技术职工，除发技术工资外，还应增发一部行政职员薪金。在八年战争中，工人死亡数目极大，今后民主政府应协同工会公司大量募招工人，并发动复员士兵大量参加工业生产。最后，大家一致认为今后边区煤业的发展，必须贯彻劳资合作方针，使工人生活得以改善，煤业资本家亦有利可图，大家同心协力，为边区煤业建设而加倍努力。"

Each business was forced to provide one to five shi, and each household was forced to provide three to more than ten shi. Wealthy households were even forced to provide hundreds of shi.

Some of the \"representatives\" questioned him and even slammed the table and scolded him, almost to the point of violence. Among those present that day were Zhu Jingnong, Chen Qicai, and over two hundred others. Chen Lifu, Zhang LiSheng, and Zhang Daofan were also in attendance. After Shao finished his speech, Wang Lifu, He Ranru, Chang Zonghui, Liu Guoping, Chen Zifeng, Li Zhenya, Ge Kunshan, Dai Ziqiu, Chen Guojun, Liu Zhidang, He Yangling, Wang Shuhui, and Chen Shichang all spoke passionately, shouting loudly. When the attendees heard the excitement, some pounded the table, kicked their feet, or made strange noises by banging on chairs, hitting teacups and plates, and cheering. Some of the speakers were pounding the table and stamping their feet. They mostly criticized the repeated postponements.\n　　Chen Zifeng said: If the National Assembly does not meet, the representatives will never leave Beijing. If you want to drive the representatives away, please bring out the guns; and he resolutely opposed the Political Consultative Conference, believing it to be unfounded in law and unacceptable. Dai Ziqiu said: \"If the national problems cannot be resolved, we can launch a punitive expedition.\" Liu Zhidang referred to the CCP as \"bandits,\" and the Political Consultative Conference as negotiation with bandits. He also said that Shao was shirking responsibility onto the leader, expressing dissatisfaction, saying that Shao's participation in the Political Consultative Conference had achieved nothing, his thinking was fundamentally wrong, and should be corrected. Xiang Yujie believed that the government did not respect the \"representatives,\" and declared on the spot that he was resigning, taking off his badge and handing it to Shao, and said that the proof documents would also be returned. He then left in anger. Hong Lanyou hurriedly rushed out to dissuade him. In the end, Shao still answered tactfully, saying that if the Political Consultative Conference was considered a failure, he would never evade responsibility, and put forward his own views on the postponement of the National Assembly, that the government intended to be cautious about this grand plan for peaceful national construction, and there was no question of breach of faith or not. As soon as Shao sat down, someone shouted and screamed, saying that his thinking was fundamentally wrong, and the crowd shouted and called for a beating. Shao still said \"It doesn't matter,\" and left the scene under the escort of several staff members. At this point, someone shouted for adjournment, and that they would talk to Chairman Chiang tomorrow.

As its mission had been accomplished, it systematically withdrew from Sipingjie on the 20th, transferring to new positions to continue resolute resistance. Heavy fighting is currently still underway near Sipingjie. The Battle of Sipingjie began on the 16th of last month.

The Kuomintang then transferred the main force of the New Sixth Army, totaling three divisions, from the Benxi area to the Sipingjie front to attack, and used American-made aircraft and tanks for intense bombing. Many houses in the city were destroyed, and civilians suffered heavy losses. Before retreating, the Democratic Allied Army inflicted effective blows on the invading troops. On the 17th and 18th, the Kuomintang army suffered thousands of casualties. The Battle of Sipingjie demonstrated the unparalleled heroism of the People's Army, thwarting the reactionaries' operational plan to capture Sipingjie before April 2nd. It has its glorious significance in the history of the Chinese People's Liberation! The people of Northeast China and the Democratic Allied Army will continue to resolutely resist with the heroic spirit of defending Sipingjie!\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 21st] At 2:00 PM on the 17th of this month, after bombing Sipingjie and the Eight-Sided City positions, seven Kuomintang aircraft dropped two wooden model aircraft over the sky more than ten li south of Lishu County. The wooden aircraft was silver-gray, with a wingspan of one meter and a body length of two Chinese feet. It was a scaled-down model of a four-engine heavy bomber, weighing seven jin. The tips of both wings were painted with two red five-pointed stars. One of the wooden aircraft landed on the Democratic Allied Army's position and is now preserved at the Democratic Allied Army headquarters for submission to the executive group as evidence. This move by the Kuomintang authorities is an old trick of framing and attempting to fabricate slanderous materials for propaganda organs after dropping the small wooden aircraft and taking photos back.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n四平街  Sipingjie\n公主岭  Gongzhuling\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n东北人民军队  Northeast People's Army\n民主联军  Democratic Allied Army\n国民党军  Kuomintang army\n新一军  New First Army\n七十一军  Seventy-first Army\n本溪  Benxi\n新六军  New Sixth Army\n长春  Changchun\n八面城  Eight-Sided City\n梨树县  Lishu County\n中国人民解放史  History of the Chinese People's Liberation\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中国人民解放史的光辉一页  血战卅余日毙伤进犯军万余  我军衔愤撤离四平街  转至郊外预定阵地继续坚强抗击\n\n1946-05-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中国人民解放史的光辉一页\n    血战卅余日毙伤进犯军万余\n    我军衔愤撤离四平街\n    转至郊外预定阵地继续坚强抗击\n    【新华社公主岭二十一日电】四平街前线，经过三十余天的激烈战争，东北人民军队——民主联军，给予进犯之国民党军以万人严重损失后，因任务业已达成，即于二十日有计划的撤离四平街，转移至新阵地，继续坚强抗击，现激战仍在四平街附近进行中。按四平街保卫战，开始于上月十六日，国民党军以新一军及七十一军为主力，共七个师，经过十多天的强攻，连遭顿挫，伤亡甚大。国方乃自本溪方面增调新六军主力等共三个师，开至四平街前线进攻，并借美制飞机坦克猛烈轰击，城内房屋多被炸毁，平民损失甚重。民主联军在撤退前，曾予进犯军以有效打击，十七十八两日国民党军伤亡千人，四平街保卫战表现了人民军队的无比英勇，粉碎了反动派限令四月二日以前攻占四平街的作战计划，它在中国人民解放史上，有其光辉意义！东北人民与民主联军，将以保卫四平街之英雄精神，继续进行坚决抵抗！\n    【新华社长春二十一日电】本月十七日下午二时，国民党飞机七架于轰炸四平街及八面城阵地后，在梨树县城正南十余里上空，投下木制小型飞机两架，该木制机为银灰色，翼长一米，身长二华尺，为四发动机重型轰炸机之缩型，全重七市斤，两翼尖端涂有红五角星两个，该木制机有一架落于民主联军阵地上，现保存于民主联军总部，以便交执行小组作证。国民党当局此举，为栽赃陷害之老法，企图于投放小木机后，摄影带回，造作宣传机关血口喷人之资料。"

    "content": "Glorious Battle of Siping Street\n    Liberation Daily Editorial, 21st\n    After inflicting significant blows and casualties on the invaders, the Democratic Allied Forces in Siping Street have strategically withdrawn from their positions on the 20th.\n    The valiant defenders of Siping Street have gloriously completed their mission. In over thirty days of bloody combat, regardless of the intensity of the bombardment from the enemy's American-made planes, artillery, rocket launchers, and tanks, the defenders of Siping Street demonstrated an iron will, inflicting tens of thousands of casualties on the invaders, causing the Kuomintang soldiers to begin to feel war-weariness, and giving the reactionaries the punishment and lessons they deserved! The Kuomintang reactionaries had set a deadline of April 2nd to capture Siping Street. They blindly believed in the omnipotence of foreign weapons and underestimated the strength of the people of Northeast China, thinking the Democratic Allied Forces were no match. They fully expected to take Siping Street in one fell swoop. Their news agency, the Central News Agency, even twice spread rumors of having occupied Siping Street (on April 15th and 18th). He Yingqin even personally announced on May 9th that the Kuomintang army had reached south of Gongzhuling. However, the Battle of Siping Street, lasting for more than a month, left the reactionaries battered and bruised, shattering their plan and myth of quickly capturing Siping Street! The Battle of Siping Street brilliantly demonstrated the great self-defense strength of the people of Northeast China in striving for peace and democracy. This battle made an extremely significant contribution to the cause of peace and democracy throughout China. It will be forever recorded in the history of the Chinese people's liberation!\n    The Chinese people sing praises of the heroic deeds of the defenders of Siping Street, and at the same time curse the reactionaries for their despicable shamelessness! The reactionaries followed a policy of non-resistance, surrendering Northeast China. The planes, tanks, and all the weaponry they received from the United States were never seriously used when the Japanese invaders rampaged through China. However, when the Northeast comrades had been liberated from the iron heel of the Japanese invaders and began to establish a peaceful and democratic life, the reactionaries launched \"fierce battles unprecedented in the eight years of the War of Resistance\" (according to Marshal Zhao Gongwu, as reported by Yishibao) against the Northeast comrades and the Democratic Allied Forces, carrying out large-scale massacres!\n    The fascist reactionaries within the Kuomintang are stubbornly pursuing their own course, waging civil war against the people of Northeast China, attempting to return the people of Northeast China to a dark and hopeless life, thereby undermining national peace and maintaining a dictatorial autocracy. This is a well-known fact. The reactionaries have repeatedly stated that \"Northeast China is not within the scope of the truce agreement.\" They tore up the Northeast truce agreement, obstructed the work of the Executive Headquarters, rejected General Marshall's and the Democratic League's proposals for a ceasefire in Northeast China, and even went so far as to collude with and re-employ the remnants of the enemy and puppet forces, launching a frenzied attack on the people of Northeast China. The responsibility for the expansion of the civil war in Northeast China lies, of course, primarily with the Chinese reactionaries. However, it must be pointed out that the reactionaries still dare to continue expanding their offensive despite the strong resistance of the people of Northeast China. This cannot but be attributed to the assistance they receive from the United States. From the beginning of the civil war in Northeast China until now, the US has never stopped helping the reactionaries, not only airlifting and shipping troops to Northeast China for them, not only guarding railways and ports for them, but also continuously supplying all kinds of weapons manufactured with the blood and sweat of the American people to slaughter the peaceful residents of Northeast China! The reactionaries' bloody hands reaching into Siping Street are possible only because they receive unlimited assistance from the United States.\n    However, we want to warn the reactionaries: the strength of the people of Northeast China and the Chinese people has become unprecedentedly powerful! Your policy of civil war and dictatorship, no matter how much support it receives from foreigners, will ultimately be crushed!\n    The people of Northeast China and the Democratic Allied Forces will continue their efforts, carry forward the spirit of the Battle of Siping Street, inflict greater blows on the invaders, resolutely defend themselves for peace and democracy, and will not stop until they achieve their goals!\n    The self-defense battle of the people of Northeast China is an important part of the national people’s cause for peace and democracy. We call on comrades throughout the country to rise up and stop the reactionaries’ crimes of civil war! We also call on the American people to demand that the US government immediately stop its aid to the Kuomintang government!\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n四平街保卫战  Battle of Siping Street\n东北  Northeast China\n民主联军  Democratic Allied Forces\n公主岭  Gongzhuling\n中央社  Central News Agency\n何应钦  He Yingqin\n益世报  Yishibao\n赵公武  Zhao Gongwu\n马歇尔  Marshall\n民主同盟  Democratic League\n国民党  Kuomintang\n解放日报  Liberation Daily\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 光荣的四平街保卫战  解放日报二十一日社论\n\n1946-05-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　光荣的四平街保卫战\n    解放日报二十一日社论\n    在给进犯者以重大打击和杀伤以后，四平街民主联军已于二十日有计划地转移阵地。\n    英勇的四平街保卫者，光荣地完成了自己的任务，在三十几天的血战中，不管对方所使用的美制飞机、大炮、火箭炮、坦克的轰击火力怎样猛烈，四平街的保卫者，表现了钢铁一般的意志，使进犯者遭受万人的损失，使国民党士兵开始发生厌战情绪，使反动派遭受应有的打击和教训！国民党反动派曾限令四月二日以前攻下四平街，他们迷信外国武器万能，轻视东北人民的力量，以为民主联军不堪一击，他们满拟一鼓而下四平街，他们的通讯社——中央社曾两次散布占领四平街的谣言（四月十五日和十八日），何应钦并于五月九日亲口宣布国民党军已到达公主岭以南，但是持续到一个月以上的四平街保卫战，打得反动派头破血流，粉碎了他们迅速占领四平街的计划与神话！四平街保卫战光辉地表现了东北人民争取和平民主的伟大自卫力量，这一保卫战对于全中国的和平民主事业，作了极其重大的供献，它将永载于中国人民的解放史上！\n    中国人民歌颂着四平街保卫者的英勇业迹，同时也咒骂着反动派的卑鄙无耻！反动派遵行不抵抗主义断送了东北，他们从美国方面得到的飞机坦克以及一切武器装备，在日寇横行中国的时间，从来没有认真拿出来一用，但是，当东北同胞已从日寇铁蹄下解放出来开始建立和平民主生活的时候，反动派却向东北同胞以及民主联军开展了“八年抗战中未有的猛烈战斗”（益世报载赵公武军长的话），进行了大规模的屠杀！\n    国民党内法西斯反动派一意孤行，向东北人民进行内战，妄图使东北人民回复暗无天日的生活，从而破坏全国和平，维持独裁专政，这是尽人皆知的事实。反动派一再声言“东北不在停战协定范围以内”，他们撕毁了东北停战协议，阻挠了执行小组的工作，拒绝了马歇尔将军与民主同盟的东北停战建议，甚至不惜勾结重用敌伪残余势力，疯狂的向东北人民猛攻，东北内战扩大的责任，当然是首先在中国反动派的身上，但是，必须指出，在东北人民坚强抵抗之前，反动派仍敢继续扩大进攻，这不能不说是由于美国方面对他的帮助。东北内战自开始一直到现在，美方对反动派的帮助，一向没有停过，不仅替他空运海运部队到东北去，不仅替他看守铁路港口，而且源源不绝地把美国人民血汗制造的各色各样武器，供给来屠杀和平的东北居民！反动派血手伸入四平街之成为可能，仅仅是由于它获得美国方面的无限的帮助。\n    但是，我们要警告反动派：东北人民和中国人民的力量已空前的强大了，你们的内战独裁政策，不管外国人给予多少支持，终究是要粉碎的！\n    东北人民和民主联军必将再接再厉，发扬四平街保卫战的精神，给进犯者以更大的打击，为和平民主坚决自卫，不达目的誓不中止！\n    东北人民的自卫战斗，是全国人民和平民主事业的重要部分，我们号召全国同胞起来，制止反动派的内战罪行！我们并号召美国人民要求美国政府，立即停止对国民党政府的援助！"

The discussions focused on two points: First, to accelerate the repair of downstream dikes, all parties agreed and are actively rushing to repair them; second, regarding the continued progress of the blocking project, UNRRA, CNRRA, and experts advocated that, in order to achieve the principle of completing both blocking and dike restoration simultaneously, piling and rock throwing should continue, initially to a height of about one to two meters, and then continue to coordinate based on the downstream dike restoration situation. The CCP representative advocated concentrating efforts on dike restoration and carrying out piling and rock throwing work after the autumn floods. No unanimous agreement was reached on the 17th. The meeting continued on the 18th and decided that the downstream dike restoration project should commence before July 5th, and the Huayuankou blocking project should continue to proceed in coordination, with the principle of not causing downstream disasters.

    "content": "Kuomintang Troops Act Tyrannically\n    Continuously Attacking and Harassing Our Rehe Liberated Area; I Have Lodged a Protest with the Military Mediation Department Regarding the Large-Scale Construction of Bunkers by Kuomintang Troops Along the Jin-Ping Railway Line\n    [New China News Agency, Chengde, 19th] Since the ceasefire order came into effect, the Kuomintang troops that have invaded Rehe have never ceased their military deployments, movements, and attacks for the past four months, and the situation has become even more serious recently. The Headquarters of the Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning Military Region hereby issues the following statement: Rehe was completely liberated by the Chinese Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army after thirteen years of arduous struggle. In August of last year, a democratic government was established through a people's representative conference, and government orders were implemented throughout the province. At the beginning of January this year, Kuomintang troops unreasonably invaded Rehe. Although the ceasefire order took effect at 24:00 on January 13, due to Chiang Kai-shek's secret order to \"seize strategic strongholds,\" the Kuomintang troops, disregarding good faith, continued to seize key points along the Jin-Quan Line (Jinzhou to Yupingquan) with large numbers of troops. On the dawn of January 14, they occupied Pingquan with two divisions of troops, and the Eighth Route Army painfully yielded. On the 19th, the 2nd Division of the 52nd Army occupied Tianyi Station from Ye Baishou, and two regiments of the 54th Division of the 13th Army attacked southward from Nanshan (the midpoint of the Ye-Chi Railway), joining forces with the 2nd Division to open up the railway line from Ye Baishou to Nanshan. On January 10, the 5th Division of the 94th Army stationed in eastern Hebei also launched a multi-pronged attack from Suizhong towards the southeastern part of Rehe, invading and occupying more than ten towns and cities, including Kuanbang, Yaowangmiao, Jianchang (Lingnan), Mingerdeng, and Boluoshu. On February 6, the 54th Division, which had invaded Tianyi, joined forces with the 4th Division, which had invaded Pingquan, to attack and occupy Huangtuliangzi and Dachuandi, eighty li to the south. At the end of February, the 5th Division of the Kuomintang army, which had invaded Boluoshu, continued to attack Dangba. At the same time, the 4th Division of the Kuomintang army in Pingquan also attacked Xiaosigou. The Eighth Route Army was forced to defend itself and repelled the 5th Division. However, that division did not abide by the Dangba agreement to stay in place, but instead transferred to the Northeast to attack the Democratic Allied Army, and the 4th Division did not withdraw to its original position in Pingquan. From the ceasefire order to March, the Kuomintang army mobilized mechanized forces of more than seven divisions to invade our territory, including Pingquan and its north and south sides (south to Xiaoheyan, north to Huangtuliangzi), more than a hundred li of the railway line north of Yebaishou, and many stations along the Jin-Quan Line. Since April, the illegal actions of the Kuomintang army have become even more egregious. In Chifeng, southeast of Pingquan, Jianchang and other places, incidents of harassment against our positions have never stopped. On April 9, reconnaissance planes openly painted with Kuomintang emblems flew low over Chengde, circling for dozens of minutes. On April 10 and 11, reconnaissance planes circled over Chengde at high altitude again.\n    In addition, they are building bunkers on a large scale and carrying out war preparations in Chifeng, southeast of Pingquan, and along the Jin-Ping Railway. At the same time, they are violating the ceasefire agreement and using the railway to transport troops in large numbers. According to investigations, (1) the 5th Division was transferred to the Northeast to fight against the Democratic Allied Army in late last month; (2) the 89th Division (belonging to the 13th Army) was transferred from the Northeast to Chaoyang last month, and the 265th Regiment of that division was transferred to Suizhong on April 10 to attack our local army in western Liaoning. Recently, a part of that division was transferred to Lingyuan; (3) the 195th Division of the 52nd Army attacked Erdaogozi in late February, was transferred to the Northeast on April 15, and participated in the Siping Street battle in late April; (4) on April 13, a cavalry unit was transferred from Lingyuan to Pingquan. The Kuomintang army's large-scale troop movements within Rehe are part of its new civil war deployment on a national scale. We have lodged a protest with the Executive Headquarters and the Executive Group and demanded a response from the Kuomintang side. If these Kuomintang troops disregard the ceasefire agreement, break their promises, move troops arbitrarily, launch wanton attacks, sabotage transportation, forcibly build bunkers, and ignore our protests, if such tyrannical acts are not stopped, then for the sake of peace, democracy, survival, and faithful implementation of the three major agreements, the people of Rehe will ultimately not be able to make endless concessions and abandon their rights. Therefore, the consequences arising from stopping the Kuomintang army's attack should be the sole responsibility of the Kuomintang side.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国共产党  Zhongguo Gongchandang (Chinese Communist Party)\n八路军   Balujun (Eighth Route Army)\n冀热辽军区司令部 Jireliao Junqu Silingbu (Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning Military Region Headquarters)\n蒋介石 Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-shek)\n锦泉线 Jin-Quan Xian (Jin-Quan Line, Jinzhou to Yupingquan)\n锦州 Jinzhou\n玉平泉 Yupingquan\n平泉 Pingquan\n五十二军 Diwushier Jun (52nd Army)\n叶柏寿 Ye Baishou\n天义车站 Tianyi Chezhan (Tianyi Station)\n十三军 Shisan Jun (13th Army)\n五十四师  Wushisi Shi (54th Division)\n南山 Nanshan\n叶赤铁路 Ye-Chi Tielu (Ye-Chi Railway)\n冀东 Jidong (Eastern Hebei)\n九十四军 Jiushisi Jun (94th Army)\n第五师 Diwu Shi (5th Division)\n绥中 Suizhong\n宽邦 Kuanbang\n药王庙 Yaowangmiao\n建昌 Jianchang (凌南) Jianchang (Lingnan)\n明尔登 Mingerdeng\n桲罗树 Boluoshu\n黄土梁子 Huangtuliangzi\n大川地 Dachuandi\n党坝 Dangba\n小寺沟 Xiaosigou\n锦平铁道 Jin-Ping Tielu (Jin-Ping Railway)\n赤峰 Chifeng\n执行部 Zhixingbu (Executive Headquarters)\n执行小组 Zhixing Xiaozu (Executive Group)\n朝阳 Chaoyang\n八十九师  Diubashijiu Shi (89th Division)\n二六五团  Erlubashiwu Tuan (265th Regiment)\n辽西 Liaoxi (Western Liaoning)\n凌源 Lingyuan\n一百九十五师 Yibaijiushiwu Shi (195th Division)\n二道河子 Erdaogozi\n四平街 Sipingjie\n民主联军 Minzhu Lianjun (Democratic Allied Army)\n热河 Rehe\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党军横行霸道  不断攻扰我热河解放区我已向军调部提出注意锦平铁道沿线国民党军大修碉堡\n\n1946-05-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党军横行霸道\n    不断攻扰我热河解放区我已向军调部提出注意锦平铁道沿线国民党军大修碉堡\n    【新华社承德十九日电】侵入热河之国民党军，自停战令生效后，迄今四个月来，从未停止军事部署调动与进攻，近日更见严重。冀热辽军区司令部特发表声明如下：热河经中国共产党及八路军十三年来之苦斗，到去年八月间全部得到解放，十月由人民代表会议产生民主政府，政令通行全省，本年一月初，国民党军无理侵入热河，一月十三日二十四时停战命令虽已发生时效，由于蒋介石密令“抢占战略要点”，国民党军仍不顾信义，继续以大量兵力，抢占锦泉线（锦州玉平泉）各要点，一月十四日拂晓，以两个师兵力占领平泉，八路军忍痛让出。十九日，五十二军第二师由叶柏寿攻占天义车站，十三军五十四师两个团，又由南山（叶赤铁路中点）向南进攻，与第二师会合，打通叶柏寿至南山之铁道线。一月十日，驻冀东之九十四军第五师，复经绥中向热河东南部分途进攻，侵占宽邦、药王庙、建昌（凌南）、明尔登、桲罗树等城镇十余处。二月六日，侵入天义之五十四师，与侵入平泉之第四师会攻，侵占黄土梁子及以南八十里之大川地。二月底，侵入桲罗树之国民党军第五师，继续向党坝进攻，同时平泉之国民党军第四师，亦进攻小寺沟，八路军被迫自卫，将第五师击退，然该师并未遵守党坝协定停驻原地，反而调往东北进攻民主联军，第四师亦并未撤回平泉原阵地。自停战令后至三月间，国民党军先后动用机械化兵力在七个师以上，侵占我之地方，则有平泉及其南北两侧（南至笑河沿，北至黄土梁子）叶柏寿以北百余里之铁道线，及锦泉线上之车站多处。四月以来，国民党军之非法行为更变本加厉，在赤峰东南平泉、建昌各地，向我阵地出扰之事件，从未停止，四月九日又公然以涂国民党徽之侦察机低飞承德上空，盘旋数十分钟，四月十日、十一日，复有侦察机至承德高空盘旋。\n    此外，在赤峰东南平泉及锦平铁道沿线，大肆修筑碉堡，进行备战动员，同时则违背停战协定，利用铁路大量运兵，现已调查有据者计：（一）上月下旬第五师调东北与民主联军作战；（二）八十九师（属十三军）上月由东北调朝阳，该师二六五团四月十日又调绥中进攻我辽西地方军，最近该师又有一部调凌源；（三）五十二军一九五师，二月下旬，曾进攻我二道河子，四月十五日，调往东北，四月下旬参加四平街作战；（四）四月十三日又有骑兵一部，由凌源调平泉。国氏党军在热河境内如此大规模调动，是其在全国范围内进行新的内战部署的一部分，我方已向执行部及执行小组提出注意，并要求国民党方面答复，因国民党军这些违背停战协定不顾信义调动军队肆意进攻，破坏交通，强修碉堡，不顾我方抗议之霸道横行，如不加以制止，则为和平为民主为生存为忠实执行三大协定，热河人民终将不能作无底止的退让，而放弃自己之权利，因此为制止国民党军队的进攻而引起的后果，应由国民党方面负完全责任。"

The sixth route moved southwest from Chenjiaxiang (more than 10 li northeast of Shoushan), passing through Wangjiawan and Chenjiazui, attacking the area east of Xinjie. All the above routes launched simultaneous attacks at 8:00 AM on May 16th, initially using heavy and light machine guns and artillery to form a dense network of fire, fiercely attacking the area around Shoushan. Our troops, in order to survive, were forced to defend themselves, and fierce fighting is now underway in the Shoushan area. The Central Plains Military Region authorities have made a request to the Military Three-Person Group to immediately stop this perfidious attack by the Kuomintang reactionaries.\n　　[Xinhua News Agency Yan'an, 20th Telegram] Today, this agency provides a comprehensive military summary: (1) On the Sipingjie front, the Nationalists are using American-made tanks and airplanes, and the battle situation is becoming increasingly fierce. South of Benxi, the Qiaotou Railway Station and Caohekou Railway Station on the An-Shen Railway were bombed by Kuomintang airplanes on the 4th and 5th. On the Beining Railway, American troops have recently increased their forces by more than 500 in the Tangshan to Kaiping area. In recent days, the Kuomintang army, under the protection of the American army, has continued to be transported to the Northeast. (2) The Kuomintang's 13th Army, 92nd Army, 94th Army, and parts of the 16th Army, leading 15,000 puppet troops from Tongxian, Wuqing and other counties, invaded the Yongding River’s northern area of the Jizhong Liberated Area. On the 15th, they occupied Anci County, and on the 16th, they occupied Panggezhuang north of Gu'an, and Hancun and other places west of Anci. Fierce fighting is taking place in all areas. (3) The Kuomintang army, in violation of the Hankou Agreement and the mediation orders of the Thirty-Two Executive Group, attacked the Shoushan area west of the Ping-Han Railway in the Central Plains Military Region on the 16th. On the same day, they also attacked the Pi (Huangpi)-An (Huang'an) southern area east of the railway. (4) The Kuomintang army in Jinan attacked the Licheng Liberated Area, occupying dozens of villages and towns. The Eighth Route Army was forced to defend itself, and on the 16th, it recovered Zhonggong Town. Furthermore, the Yudong (Eastern Henan) army and people repelled the Kuomintang and puppet army's attack and recovered HeYangji. (5) In addition, south of Taizhou, units of the Kuomintang 100th Army attacked the edge of the First Division of Suwan (Jiangsu-Anhui), occupying several villages and towns. In Jinzhong, Yan Xishan's army, in conjunction with the Japanese army and puppet forces under Yang Cheng, launched 17 attacks on Qinggou, Xugou and other areas from the 7th to the 14th.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\nPeople:\n\n阎锡山  Yan Xishan\n杨诚  Yang Cheng\n\nPlaces:\n\n宣化店  Xuanhuaidian\n汉口  Hankou\n中原解放区  Central Plains Liberated Area\n寿山  Shoushan\n平汉路  Ping-Han Railway\n西安陆  Xian'an\n应山  Yingshan\n大邦店  Dabangdian\n魏家店  Weijiadian\n大路湾  Daluwan\n毛家店  Maojiadian\n高家湾  Gaojiawan\n孙家观  Sunjiaguan\n唐家湾  Tangjiawan\n屈家咀  Qujiazui\n长岭岗  Changlinggang\n余家庙  Yujiamiao\n孙家湾  Sunjiawan\n万家咀  Wanjiazui\n笔架山  Bijia Mountain\n平林市  Pinglinshi\n荣石咀  Rongshizui\n曹家湾  Caojiawan\n早树林  Zaoshulin\n接管厅  Jieguting\n桥头湾  Qiaotouwan\n栗树湾  Lishuwang\n陈家巷  Chenjiaxiang\n王家湾  Wangjiawan\n陈家咀  Chenjiazui\n新街  Xinjie\n四平街  Sipingjie\n本溪  Benxi\n安沈铁路  An-Shen Railway\n桥头车站  Qiaotou Railway Station\n草河口  Caohekou\n北宁路  Beining Railway\n唐山  Tangshan\n开平  Kaiping\n通县  Tongxian\n武清  Wuqing\n冀中解放区  Jizhong Liberated Area\n永定河  Yongding River\n安次县城  Anci County\n固安  Gu'an\n庞各庄  Panggezhuang\n韩村  Hancun\n陂  Pi (Huangpi)\n安  An (Huang'an)\n济南  Jinan\n历城解放区  Licheng Liberated Area\n中宫镇  Zhonggong Town\n豫东  Yudong\n何杨集  HeYangji\n泰州  Taizhou\n苏皖一分区  First Division of Suwan (Jiangsu-Anhui)\n晋中  Jinzhong\n清沟  Qinggou\n徐沟  Xugou\n\nOrganizations:\n\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n国民党  Kuomintang\n中原军区  Central Plains Military Region\n军事三人小组  Military Three-Person Group\n六十六军  66th Army\n十三师  13th Division\n七十五军  75th Army\n第六师  6th Division\n三十二执行组  Thirty-Two Executive Group\n八路军  Eighth Route Army\n\nEvents:\n\n汉口协议  Hankou Agreement\n\nOther:\n\n伪军  Puppet troops\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党当局撕毁汉口协议  背信进攻中原解放区  我军被迫自卫寿山地区发生激战中原军区当局要求三人小组立予制止\n\n1946-05-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党当局撕毁汉口协议\n    背信进攻中原解放区\n    我军被迫自卫寿山地区发生激战中原军区当局要求三人小组立予制止\n    【新华社宣化店十八日急电】军事三人小组的汉口协议墨迹未干，而国民党当局即违背协议，于十六日六路进攻平汉路西安陆、应山解放区，进犯军为国民党六十六军十三师、及七十五军第六师所部，与应山的地方部队，中心合击目标为应山西南四十里的寿山解放区，第一路由大邦店（寿山以北三十余里）以北地区向南出动。第二路由魏家店（应山西北十余里）向西南出动，经大路湾、毛家店、高家湾、孙家观等地，进攻寿山以北的唐家湾、屈家咀。第三路由长岭岗（应山西偏北约十余里）向东南出动，经余家庙、孙家湾，进攻寿山西北之万家咀、笔架山。第四路由平林市（寿山西南十余里）向东北出动，经荣石咀、曹家湾、早树林进攻寿山以南地区。第五路由接管厅（寿山东十余里）向西出动，经桥头湾、栗树湾、进攻寿山东南地区。第六路由陈家巷（寿山东北十余里）向西南出动，经王家湾、陈家咀，进攻新街以东地区。以上各路，于五月十六日午前八时同时进攻，一开始即以轻重机枪大炮组织严密的火网，猛攻寿山地区四周，我军为求生存，被迫自卫，现正在寿山地区激战中。中原军区当局，已向军事三人小组提出要求，立即制止国民党反动派此种背信弃义的进攻。\n    【新华社延安二十日电】今日本社综合军息：（一）四平街前线，国方使用美制坦克飞机，战况日趋激烈。本溪以南，安沈铁路上的桥头车站、草河口等车站，四日五日遭国民党飞机轰炸。北宁路上美军、在唐山至开平间，最近增兵五百余人。连日国民党军在美军保护下，继续运往东北。（二）国民党十三军、九十二军、九十四军、十六军各一部，率通县、武清等县伪军共一万五千人向冀中解放区永定河以北地区进犯，于十五日侵占安次县城，十六日侵占固安以北的庞各庄，及安次以西的韩村等地，各个地区均在激战中。（三）国民党军违反汉口协议，及三十二执行组的调处命令，于十六日进攻中原军区平汉路西寿山地区外，同日又向路东陂（黄陂）、安（黄安）南地区进攻。（四）济南国民党军进攻历城解放区，侵占村镇数十处。八路军被迫自卫，于十六日恢复中宫镇，又豫东军民击退国民党与伪军的进攻，并将何杨集恢复。（五）此外泰州以南的口岸，国民党一百军所部，向东进攻苏皖一分区边缘地区，侵占村镇若干处。晋中阎锡山军，结合日军及伪军杨诚等部，从七日至十四日进攻清沟、徐沟一带，共达十七次。"

Upon arriving in Zhengzhou on the 13th, the Kuomintang side used the excuse of having matters to attend to in order to delay them for a day. On the 14th, upon arriving in Zhongmu, the Kuomintang side fabricated the story that the Yellow River Railway Bridge in Kaifeng was broken, causing them to return to Zhengzhou. On the 15th, they rerouted south of Xinxiang, passing through Xiaoji Town, to reach Kaifeng. On the same day, the American side had already agreed to go to Eastern Henan the next day, and they could arrive at Fujii (south of Qi County) on the 17th. That evening, the Kuomintang side again requested to inspect Dongming first before going to Eastern Henan. After our representative, Colonel Li Jingyi, exposed this conspiracy one by one, the Kuomintang side still insisted on going to Dongming first. This kind of deliberate delaying, shifting the target, by the Kuomintang authorities, in order to facilitate their troops' \"encirclement and suppression\" of the Eastern Henan Liberated Area, is truly worthy of the nation's deep attention.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n豫东  Yudong (Eastern Henan)\n邯郸  Handan\n郑州  Zhengzhou\n中牟  Zhongmu\n开封  Kaifeng\n黄河  Huang He (Yellow River)\n新乡  Xinxiang\n小冀镇 Xiaoji Town\n傅集  Fujii\n杞县  Qi County\n东明  Dongming\n李静宜  Li Jingyi\n国民党 Kuomintang\n美国 American\n豫东解放区 Eastern Henan Liberated Area\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党当局故意拖延时间留难执行小组赴豫东调处\n\n1946-05-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党当局故意拖延时间留难执行小组赴豫东调处\n    【邯郸二十日电】赴豫东调处之豫东执行组，途中遭国民党多方阻难，十三日抵郑州，国方借口有事拖延一天。十四日至中牟，国方又捏造开封黄河铁桥已断，复返回郑州。十五日改道经新乡以南之小冀镇抵开封。当日美方已应次日赴豫东，十七日可抵傅集（杞县南），至晚国方又要求先去东明视察，然后赴豫东，此中阴谋，经我代表李静宜上校一一揭穿后，国方依然要先去东明。国民党当局此种故意拖延时间，转移目标，以便利其部队对豫东解放区之“进剿”，实堪国人深刻注意。"

At 6:45 p.m. that afternoon, General Song was returning to the Beijing Hotel from Beixin Street in car number 10846. When the car passed the south entrance of Bamiancao near Dengshikou, the traffic was very slow due to the crowded area. Unexpectedly, he was suddenly attacked by thugs ambushed there. A small hole was shot through the several-minute-thick glass of Song's car, but fortunately, Song was not injured. The driver, Su Qingshan, immediately accelerated and drove Song back to the Beijing Hotel at high speed. Afterwards, the Communist Party sent personnel to report to the Police Bureau. The Bureau Chief, Chen Zhuo, along with the Head of the Judicial Section and ballistics expert Ju Zengyu, went to inspect the bullet marks on the car. According to Mr. Ju's identification, the shots were fired from the front of the car using a No. 3 Browning pistol. At the same time, Committee Member Ye Jianying of the Military Mediation Department also sent letters to the Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and the Police Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation. Luo Ruiqing, Chief of Staff of the Communist Party in the Military Mediation Department, also informed the American member Robertson and Kuomintang Chief of Staff Cai Wenzhi of the assassination attempt on Song. Because the matter concerned the assassination of an important member of the Executive Headquarters, Luo suggested that the Executive Headquarters make a serious representation to the responsible security authorities to thoroughly investigate. The assassination attempt on General Song Shilun is clearly related to the current deterioration of the national political situation and the full-scale expansion of the civil war by the Kuomintang fascists, and has therefore attracted close attention from all parties.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n北平\tBeiping\n宋时轮\tSong Shilun\n叶剑英\tYe Jianying\n新华社\tXinhua News Agency\n延安\tYan'an\n军调部\tMilitary Mediation Department\n中共方面\tCommunist Party side\n执行处长\tChief of the Executive Office\n北京饭店\tBeijing Hotel\n北新街\tBeixin Street\n灯市口\tDengshikou\n八面槽\tBamiancao\n苏庆善\tSu Qingshan\n警察总局\tPolice Bureau\n陈焯\tChen Zhuo\n司法科长\tHead of the Judicial Section\n鞠增钰\tJu Zengyu\n警备司令部\tGarrison Headquarters\n市政府\tMunicipal Government\n罗瑞卿\tLuo Ruiqing\n美方委员饶伯森\tAmerican member Robertson\n国民党方面参谋长蔡文治\tKuomintang Chief of Staff Cai Wenzhi\n勃郎林手枪\tBrowning pistol\n国民党\tKuomintang\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党法西斯派扩大内战中  宋时轮将军在平遇刺  叶委员剑英函请治安当局切实查究\n\n1946-05-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党法西斯派扩大内战中\n    宋时轮将军在平遇刺\n    叶委员剑英函请治安当局切实查究\n    【新华社延安二十日电】北平讯：军调部中共方面执行处长宋时轮少将，十五日在平遇刺，幸未中伤。是日下午六时四十五分，宋将军由北新街乘坐一零八四六号汽车回返北京饭店，道经灯市口附近的八面槽南口时，因地区热闹，车行甚缓，不料突遭预伏该处的暴徒开枪行刺，宋车后数分厚的玻璃被射一小孔，宋氏幸未受伤，司机苏庆善即急开足速率，将宋氏飞速送回北京饭店。事后中共方面即派员报告警察总局，由局长陈焯率同司法科长及研究弹道之技士鞠增钰，前往检验车上弹痕，据鞠技士鉴定，系用三号勃郎林手枪由车前射击者。同时军调部叶委员剑英，亦即分函警备司令部、市政府、及警察总局，请予切实查究。军调部中共方面参谋长罗瑞卿，亦将宋氏遇刺经过，分别告知美方委员饶伯森及国民党方面参谋长蔡文治，并因事关谋刺执行部重要人员，罗氏提议由执行部向负责治安当局严重交涉，彻底查究。宋时轮将军此次遇刺，显与目前全国政治局势恶化，国民党法西斯派全力扩大内战有关，故已引起各方密切注意。"

    "content": "The Kuomintang fascist faction has recently dispatched a large number of agents, in collusion with puppet bandits, to infiltrate our liberated areas to carry out assassinations in coordination with their military offensives. This urgently requires serious vigilance.\n    In the Jinnan area: Thirty armed agents from En County went to Sunzhuang Village on the night of March 27 to commit atrocities, and our village cadres were brutally beaten. In De County, more than 30 of our stationed troops suffered from water poisoning, with three deaths. When the people of Wei County were rushing to control the river, more than 50 plainclothes members of the puppet bandit Wang Daosheng's unit took the opportunity on the night of April 9, carrying machine guns to Qianpu'an, disguised as the Eighth Route Army, and under the pretext of needing stretchers, broke into civilian houses and looted extensively, kidnapping village chief Li Zhiming and six others. On April 12, more than 40 people with guns continued to Ya'lijie to capture village cadres. On April 27, the traitor agents of Bo Town, Cang County, surrounded our Nanxiakou Industrial and Commercial Office, robbing more than one million yuan of Jicha banknotes and destroying all the furniture in the house. Three cooks from the district office were also kidnapped.\n    In addition, a large number of young female agents have been sent to seduce and kill with female charm. According to a female agent captured in Quzhou, they were dispatched from Anyang in a group of dozens, each carrying an American-made electric knife. Those stabbed bleed to death instantly. According to incomplete statistics, in Jun County, 21 people in three villages were killed in this way, more than 200 in Linzhang, and 67 people were killed in the tenth and sixth districts of Anyang alone in early March.\n    In the Jin-Lu-Yu area: Neihuang has seen continuous incidents of Kuomintang agents colluding with puppet troops to carry out assassinations in our liberated areas. On April 6, a company from the puppet Neihuang Security Team under Duan Dongmei sneaked into Nanyangwu Village in our Second District, killing Gou Cunyuan, the chairman of the village farmers' association, and Gou Zhishu and Li Zhanggui, members of the farmers' association, and capturing eight militiamen and villagers. On the night of April 12, more than 30 armed agents, posing as our Anyang Detachment, went to the residence of our district joint association and captured four district cadres. On April 24, when Comrade Hu of the county district joint association and Li Lou were holding a mass meeting, 30 plainclothes armed agents with white towels tied on their right arms suddenly came and dispersed the meeting, captured Comrade Hu and the village farmers' association director, and robbed six guns. Xie Yixiang, deputy director of the Feizhuang Farmers' Association in Feng County, was killed by agent Gao Fude on the night of April 11. The agent led six people and went to Yuanji the following night, kidnapped and killed Yuan Jiayin, a businessman from the village. The residence of the militiamen in Chenlou Village, Second District, Qiyu County, was attacked by more than 30 armed agents. The militiamen rose up to defend themselves and fought for an hour before repelling them. According to incomplete statistics, recently in Jining, Heze, Puyang, Kunwu, Kunshan, and other counties, a total of eleven village cadres have been assassinated, ten robbery incidents, six extortion incidents, and three attacks on institutions have occurred. Recently, a plainclothes special agent team was discovered in Jining, directly led by the Jinan Special Agent Agency, divided into political and special agent teams, and further divided into eight groups, operating independently. The heads of its 112th group, Shan Zuojing and Qiu Wochen, have been captured by the government.\n    In the Taihang area: In the Zhenbie (identification) work in Guai'er Town, Zuoquan, special agents who had not been noticed in the past were found to have infiltrated our various work departments to carry out sabotage. It is estimated that there is a special agent group in the militia and a special agent group in the economic department. When the Fifth District of Heshun held a district and village cadre meeting, three village cadres were poisoned to death.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n冀南    Jìn nán (Southern Hebei)\n恩县    Ēn xiàn (En County)\n孙庄村  Sūn zhuāng cūn (Sunzhuang Village)\n德县    Dé xiàn (De County)\n魏县    Wèi xiàn (Wei County)\n王道生  Wáng Dàoshēng (Wang Daosheng)\n前普安  Qián pǔ ān (Qianpu'an)\n李治明  Lǐ Zhìmíng (Li Zhiming)\n牙里集  Yá lǐ jí (Ya'lijie)\n沧县    Cāng xiàn (Cang County)\n泊镇    Bó zhèn (Bo Town)\n南霞口  Nán xiá kǒu (Nanxiakou)\n冀钞    Jì chāo (Ji currency)\n曲周    Qǔ zhōu (Quzhou)\n安阳    Ānyáng (Anyang)\n浚县    Jùn xiàn (Jun County)\n临漳    Línzhāng (Linzhang)\n冀鲁豫  Jì Lǔ Yù (Hebei-Shandong-Henan)\n内黄    Nèi huáng (Neihuang)\n段东梅  Duàn Dōngméi (Duan Dongmei)\n南羊坞村 Nán yáng wù cūn (Nanyangwu Village)\n苟村元  Gǒu Cūnyuán (Gou Cunyuan)\n苟至书  Gǒu Zhìshū (Gou Zhishu)\n李章桂  Lǐ Zhāngguì (Li Zhanggui)\n安阳支队 Ānyáng zhīduì (Anyang Detachment)\n扈同志  Hù tóngzhì (Comrade Hu)\n李楼    Lǐ lóu (Li Lou)\n丰县    Fēng xiàn (Feng County)\n沸庄    Fèi zhuāng (Feizhuang)\n谢义祥  Xiè Yìxiáng (Xie Yixiang)\n高福德  Gāo Fúdé (Gao Fude)\n袁集    Yuán jí (Yuanji)\n袁家寅  Yuán Jiāyín (Yuan Jiayin)\n齐禹县  Qí yǔ xiàn (Qiyu County)\n陈楼    Chén lóu (Chenlou)\n济宁    Jǐníng (Jining)\n荷泽    Hézé (Heze)\n濮县    Pú xiàn (Puyang)\n昆吾    Kūn wú (Kunwu)\n昆山    Kūn shān (Kunshan)\n济南    Jǐnán (Jinan)\n山作静  Shān Zuòjìng (Shan Zuojing)\n邱斡臣  Qiū Wòchén (Qiu Wochen)\n太行    Tàiháng (Taihang)\n左权    Zuǒquán (Zuoquan)\n拐儿镇  Guǎi er zhèn (Guai'er Town)\n甄别    Zhēnbié (Identification)\n和顺    Héshùn (Heshun)\n八路军  Bā lù jūn (Eighth Route Army)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党派遣特务潜入我区  暗杀放毒配合军事进攻  女特务随带电刀四出诱杀值得警惕\n\n1946-05-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党派遣特务潜入我区\n    暗杀放毒配合军事进攻\n    女特务随带电刀四出诱杀值得警惕\n    【本报特讯】国民党法西斯派，近派遣大批特务，结合伪匪，潜入我解放区进行暗杀，以配合其军事的进攻，亟宜引起严重警惕。\n    冀南方面：恩县武装特务三十名，于三月二十七日晚到孙庄村行凶，我村干部惨遭毒打。德县我驻军服水中毒者三十余人，死者三人。魏县人民正突击治河时，伪匪王道生部便衣队五十余，乘机于四月九日夜，携机枪到前普安，伪装八路军彩号，借口要担架，撞入民室，大肆抢劫，架去村长李治明等七人。四月十二日继有四十多人带枪到牙里集捕捉村干部。沧县泊镇汉奸特务四月二十七日将我南霞口工商事务所包围，抢去冀钞百余万元，并把屋内用具悉数捣毁，区公所火夫三人亦被绑去。\n    此外尚派出大批年青女特务，以女色相诱杀，据曲周查获一女特务供称：她们从安阳相随派出共数十人，各带美式电刀一把。被刺者流血即死。据不完全统计：浚县三个村如此被杀者达二十一人，临漳二百余，安阳十、六两区仅三月上旬被害即达六十七人。\n    冀鲁豫方面：内黄连续发生国特勾结伪军到我解放区进行暗杀事件。四月六日，伪内黄保安队段东梅部一个连，窜到我二区南羊坞村，将该村农会主任苟村元、农会会员苟至书、李章桂打死，捉去民兵及村民共八人。四月十二日晚，武装特务三十余人，假冒我安阳支队，到我区联合会驻地，抓去区干部四人。四月二十四日，该县区联合会扈同志与李楼召开群众大会时，突来右臂缚白毛巾便衣武装特务三十个，将会场冲散，将扈同志与村农会主任捕去并劫去枪六支。丰县沸庄副农会主任谢义祥，于四月十一日夜，被特务高福德打死，该特务率六人，又于次晚到袁集将该村商人袁家寅绑去打死。齐禹县二区陈楼村民兵住处，被三十余武装特务袭击，民兵起而自卫，战一小时，始将其击退。据不完全统计，最近在济宁、荷泽、濮县、昆吾、昆山等县内，共有十一个村干部被暗杀，发生抢劫事件十一起，敲榨事件六起，袭击机关三次。济宁最近发现一便衣特务队，直接受济南特务机关领导，内分政治与特务两队，下分八个小组，单独活动。其第一一二小组负责人山作静、邱斡臣，已被政府捕获。\n    太行方面：左权拐儿镇在甄别工作中，发现过去一贯未注意的特务分子，打入我各工作部门，进行破坏。计民兵中有一个特务小组，经济部门中有一特务小组。和顺五区举行区村干部会时，被毒死村干部三人。"

The *Misri* wrote: Britain has launched a huge conspiracy against the independence of Egypt and Sudan. Egypt seeks complete independence, not dominion status within the British Empire. Britain's treaty with Egypt is detrimental to Egyptian independence. The Muslim Brotherhood magazine said: The Anglo-Egyptian alliance only benefits Britain and is of no benefit to Egypt. *Al-Ahram* warned: Britain attempts to make Egypt guarantee mutual assistance in the event of a threat of war. If we allow Britain to use the term \"threat of war,\" then its army will return the day after it withdraws. Whoever creates the threat of war and provokes conflict is certainly Britain. The so-called withdrawal of troops is just a deceptive trick, which cannot deceive people who have experienced sixty years of British rule. *Al-Balagh* stated: Britain's proposals to Egypt are almost identical to the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. Britain's so-called \"concessions\" to Egypt are equal to zero due to the large number of preconditions it has put forward.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n米西报  Misri\n埃及    Egypt\n英国    Britain\n苏丹    Sudan\n开罗    Cairo\n延安    Yan'an\n路透社  Reuters\n回教兄弟协会杂志  Muslim Brotherhood magazine\n阿坦姆报  Al-Ahram\n阿勒巴雷报  Al-Balagh\n英埃条约  Anglo-Egyptian Treaty\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 埃及各报抨击英埃订约\n\n1946-05-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　埃及各报抨击英埃订约\n    【新华社延安十八日电】据路透社讯：英埃缔约谈判继续进行中，现已达起草条约阶段。\n    【新华社延安十八日电】开罗讯：埃及各报继续抨击英埃缔订盟约，《米西》报写道：英国对埃及和苏丹的独立，已发动了巨大的阴谋，埃及是为了完全独立，不是为了在英帝国内求得自治领地位，英国一定要与埃及缔约，是损害埃及独立的。回教兄弟协会杂志说：英埃联盟，只对英国有利，对埃及毫无益处。《阿坦姆》报警告称：英国企图使埃及保证在战争威胁时之互助，假如我们准许英国使用“战争威胁”这名词，那末它的军队在撤退后第二天就会回来的，谁造成战争威胁，谁将挑起战端，当然是英国的所谓撤兵，只是骗人的手段，这是骗不了经过了六十年英国统治的人们的。《阿勒巴雷报》谓：英国对埃及的建议，几与一九三六年的英埃条约无异，英国向埃及的所谓“让步”，由于它提出一大堆先决条件已等于零。"

On the 12th, they forcibly occupied 24 villages and towns including Dajiangou, Dianzi, and Zhonggong (all located more than 30 li south of Jinan). Most villages in the Shaojin and Quanlu districts of Licheng were also completely occupied. Wherever they went, they devastated the families of soldiers and mass organizations.

In the plains areas of Wenshui, Fenyang, and Pingyao in the Jin-Sui Border Region, wheat seedlings are thriving, a phenomenon unseen in nearly twenty years. Spring wheat in Xingxian, Linxian, and other places is also the best in over a decade. In the main cotton-growing areas of Lüliang and other places, most of the cotton had been sown before Grain Rain (a traditional Chinese solar term). Wheat seedlings in Shandong are also flourishing, with favorable rainfall in the Linyi area on the 6th. In the Bohai region, the 10 million mu of wheat fields, accounting for half of the cultivated land, are expected to yield a bumper harvest, and most autumn crops have also sprouted. Rainfall has also been abundant in various parts of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. In the Ji-Zhong and Ji-Dong areas, wheat seedlings have already grown over two chi in height and are about to head and fill. According to estimates by experienced farmers, if there are no unexpected events, each mu of wheat can yield seven dou to one shi, potentially reaching 80% to 90% of a normal year's harvest. In the Ji-Xi areas, successive heavy rains fell on the 16th and 28th of last month, and the masses are carrying out intensive sowing.

    "date": "1946-05-23",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "The Thriving Jining City\n\n　　Jining City is located in the southwestern part of Shandong Province, at the eastern end of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region. It is the terminus of the Yanzhou-Jining branch line of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and the hub of the Yanji (Yanzhou-Jining), Jihe (Jining-Heze), Jijin (Jining-Jinxiang), Jidong (Jining-Dong'a), and Jiyun (Jining-Yuncheng) highways. The Grand Canal flows through the south of the city, making both water and land transportation extremely convenient. It is the political, economic, and cultural center of over twenty counties in southwestern Shandong. The city has more than four hundred and sixty streets of varying sizes, with a population of over 150,000, making it the largest city in the entire border region and the second-largest city in Shandong Province. Having suffered all kinds of devastation during the enemy's occupation, its vitality was greatly diminished. However, since being liberated by the Eighth Route Army on January 9th of this year, and under the democratic government's active implementation of democratic construction, promotion of industry and commerce, reduction of the people's burden, and establishment of education policies, the city has shown a thriving new atmosphere in just four months. The recent situation is introduced below:\n\n            Commerce\n\n　　After eight years of oppression and rule by the enemy and traitors, the various businesses in Jining City were extremely depressed. More than eighty percent of the city's stores, large and small, had closed down. The Jining branch of the Hebei-Jinan Bank issued a large number of commercial loans. In April alone, the amount of commercial loans reached 14,612,000 yuan. Various businesses are rapidly recovering. There are now more than four thousand businesses, large and small, that have resumed operations, and forty-three trade associations have been organized. The city's industries are dominated by the leather industry. The furs from more than twenty counties in western Shandong, northern Henan, and northern Jiangsu are collected and distributed here. Before the war, four million pieces of lambskin could be exported annually. All fifty leather firms in the city closed down after the enemy arrived. Currently, twenty firms have resumed large-scale trading, exporting approximately ten thousand pieces of fur daily, worth a total of 70,000,000 yuan. Before the war, the wool trade could reach seven to eight hundred thousand jin per day when spring wool came on the market. It is estimated that this year, it can recover to half of the pre-war level. The second most important trade is in grain, especially wheat. The wheat produced in wheat-producing areas such as Wenshang, Jinxiang, and Yutai is also collected and distributed here. Currently, there are four large grain markets in the city, one of which, the Bakou Grain Market, has ten large grain firms, selling three hundred dan of grain daily. The third is the livestock trade. Livestock from the Northeast also pass through here. Three hundred and eighty heads can be traded daily, amounting to 4,700,000 yuan. The trade in homespun cloth reaches 6,000,000 yuan per day. The Commercial Bureau held a symposium for the city's industrial and commercial circles, announcing the democratic economic policy, exempting various exorbitant taxes and levies, and jointly studying the direction of industrial and commercial construction. Now, old people who did not dare to enter the city for eight years are rushing to the city to do business, and the market is becoming more and more prosperous.\n\n            Industry\n\n　　The industry of Jining City is also rapidly recovering with the support of the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the Jining Fourth Branch of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Trading Company. Dozens of larger factories, such as electric lights, flour, matches, egg factories, and ironworks, have started operations one after another.\n\n　　The electric light company, on the evening of Jining's liberation, the sound of motors was rumbling, turning the dark and silent city of Jining into a bright and glorious city. The factory has two 360-horsepower generators and one No. 2 boiler. With the hard work of all the factory employees all night, it can provide electricity for 23,000 electric lights in the city. In addition to working hard at their jobs, they are preparing to repair water pipes to sell water, and to operate an electrical materials shop as a sideline production. In addition, they can also share the profits of the company in half.\n\n　　Jifeng Flour Company, with government funding, officially started operations on April 10th. Currently, Mr. Gui Jifeng represents the former owner of the factory, Liu Zhuqiao, and signed a contract with the government to jointly operate the factory. It has a total capital of 70,000,000 yuan (Ji banknotes), and produces 40,000 jin of flour per day. Once the machinery is repaired, it will be able to produce 80,000 jin per day. Not only can it supply the needs of the city, but it can also be sold to major cities such as Jinan, Xuzhou, Beiping, and Tianjin. Several of the city's original iron factories mostly manufactured gunpowder and other weapons when the enemy was present. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the border region's military industry began to shift to manufacturing production tools. The military industry department of the military region changed the Jining arsenal into an industrial and agricultural manufacturing plant, turning the original sand-turning department into an agricultural tool manufacturing department, the mechanical department into a machine manufacturing department, and the gunpowder and electrical department into a laboratory. Thanks to the efforts of workers and technicians, the tool manufacturing department has manufactured iron pots, iron lamps, plowshares, and axles. The machine department has manufactured ginning machines, cotton carding machines, oil presses, textile machines, flour mills, bicycle parts, and other small machines. They are currently researching the manufacture of cigarette-making machines and button-making machines. The laboratory has begun to manufacture soap and is researching the manufacture of bleaching powder. All departments have officially started operations. The workers' production enthusiasm is extremely high. They expressed that they would produce more agricultural tools to help farmers carry out large-scale production and work even harder. The factory is calling on groups and individuals to invest in the factory to expand production. Currently, no less than hundreds of people come to the factory gate to purchase goods every day, and cars and rickshaws are constantly coming and going, making it extremely crowded.\n\n　　The city's seven dyeing and weaving industries and seventeen paper mounting industries have also started operations one after another. Other small industries such as forty textile industries, leather making, soap making, and steel have all started operations. Tongxinxiang and other three mechanical egg factories, two match factories, and poverty alleviation factories are also actively preparing to resume work.\n\n            Culture and Education\n\n　　With the major recovery of industry and commerce and the improvement of people's lives, cultural and educational undertakings have also been launched. Bookstores and printing industries have resumed operations one after another. The Jining Daily was launched on May 1st. Due to the difficulty of manpower and machinery, it will temporarily be published in two pages. After several months, when the offset printing machine and editorial staff are complete, it can be published daily. Currently, there are three middle schools in the city, with more than 2,000 students, nine complete primary schools, twenty-four junior primary schools, and one normal school with more than 6,000 students. In order to carry out the cultural education of the people, a municipal library, a people's education center, a public sports field, a vocational school, a reading room, and the reform of old dramas have been established.\n\n            Transportation\n\n　　Since peace, Jining City's transportation construction has become increasingly developed. Highways and postal services are unblocked in all four directions. Since the establishment of the bus station, the number of passengers on each route has increased daily. The three buses to Tai'an daily have more than one hundred passengers. There are also daily buses to Heze, Juancheng, and Jiaxiang, which are also very crowded. The business income for this item in March was more than 450,000 yuan, and in April it increased to more than 1,000,000 yuan. The Jiji (Tengxian), and Jixu (Xuzhou) lines are being rushed to be repaired, and several sedan cars and small sleeper cars have been added to run on various lines. City buses will start soon. Since the merger of the China Post Office and the Transportation Bureau, the number of incoming and outgoing mails has surged. In April alone, more than 141,800 incoming letters and more than 131,700 outgoing letters were received. The mails sent to Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, Tianjin, Hankou, Sichuan, Guizhou, and other places have all received return letters and receipts.\n\n            Municipal Administration\n\n　　The citizens of this city, under the enemy and puppet's eight years of bloody exploitation, have been devastated and persecuted, and many have fallen into a state of hunger and cold. After liberation, our democratic government allocated hundreds of thousands of catties of grain to relieve the disaster areas in Chengdong and Nanguan, which were looted and burned by the traitor Liu Bengong, and more than 14,470 poor citizens. All the affected areas have been completely restored, and a new atmosphere of peaceful construction is overflowing everywhere. The suffering citizens have built their new homes on the rubble. The municipal government, in order to prosper the market and tidy up the city, has established a municipal construction committee to prepare to open up more new markets and local product markets in Southeast Guan. Garbage cans are set up everywhere on the streets, large and small. Every day, street cleaners sweep, daily tidy up public toilets, give citizens vaccinations, and adjust well water prices. Strengthen relief work and renovate the original disability homes, porridge factories, homeless shelters, blind people's public offices, orphanages, and kindergartens with huge sums of money. And with 400,000 yuan to repair the Taibai Tower, which was destroyed by the great traitor Liu Bengong. City parks, municipal auditoriums, and match companies, and other large and small shopping malls are also under preparation.\n\n            Newborn People\n\n　　In Jining's grain firms, livestock firms, grass firms, cloth firms, and other markets, the bosses and managers sitting in the accounting rooms or standing in front of the counters are no longer those glaring adults. Instead, they are members of various levels who have turned over and are managing the market. They resolutely oppose bad people who seek personal gain and engage in corruption. These newborn people, after becoming masters, have eradicated unscrupulous acts of corruption and extortion. Poor people all have food to eat. Before liberation, there were sixty families on Wensheng Street alone who ate bean cakes and tree leaves, moaning in hunger all year round. Now, even the worst life of every poor citizen has enough sorghum noodles and some wheat noodles. Many people can be seen on the street changing into new clothes. Mud mason Guo Hongxiang said, \"This is the first time I have worn new clothes in eight years.\" Wang Zhaotai excitedly said, \"In the past, I pulled a cart all day and couldn't even earn enough to eat. I had to go hungry on rainy days. Now, not only is it enough for the whole family to live on, but there is also surplus grain to do business.\" These poor people who have turned over are all boasting about their good times of democracy and freedom. Cui Desheng happily told reporters, \"Comrades: Quickly publish our lives in the newspaper so that people everywhere know that in our place, the poor have come forward and the bad people have all become good. For example, Zhang Baolin of Wensheng Street used to be a puppet soldier, smoked opium and drank alcohol, and often beat and scolded his mother. Since the Eighth Route Army came, he has reformed.\" In this new group of people, there are no more idlers, hooligans, or local bullies.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    China\n山东省  Shandong Sheng (Shandong Province)\n冀鲁豫区  Ji-Lu-Yu Qu (Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region)\n津浦铁路  Tianjin-Pukou Railway\n兖州  Yanzhou\n济宁  Jining\n荷泽  Heze\n金乡  Jinxiang\n东阿  Dong'a\n郓城  Yuncheng\n大运河  Dà Yùnhé (Grand Canal)\n鲁西南  Lu Xinan (Southwestern Shandong)\n第八路军  Diba Lu Jun (Eighth Route Army)\n冀南银行  Ji Nan Yin Hang (Hebei-Jinan Bank)\n汶上  Wenshang\n鱼台  Yutai\n巴口粮场  Bakou Liangchang (Bakou Grain Market)\n晋冀鲁豫贸易总公司济宁第四分公司  Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Maoyi Zong Gongsi Jining Di Si Fen Gongsi (Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Trading Company, Jining Fourth Branch)\n济丰面粉公司  Jifeng Mianfen Gongsi (Jifeng Flour Company)\n刘竹樵  Liu Zhuqiao\n济南  Jinan\n徐州  Xuzhou\n北平  Beiping\n天津  Tianjin\n军区军工部  Junqu Jungong Bu (Military Region Military Industry Department)\n文盛街  Wen Sheng Jie\n郭鸿祥  Guo Hongxiang\n王兆泰  Wang Zhaotai\n崔得胜  Cui Desheng\n张保林  Zhang Baolin\n泰安  Tai'an\n鄄城  Juancheng\n嘉祥  Jiaxiang\n济滕  Ji-Teng\n济徐  Ji-Xu\n中华邮政局  Zhonghua Youzhengju (China Post Office)\n交通局   Jiaotongju (Transportation Bureau)\n北京   Beijing\n上海   Shanghai\n汉口   Hankou\n四川   Sichuan\n桂   Gui (Guangxi)\n刘本功   Liu Bengong\n东南关   Dongnan Guan\n太白楼   Taibai Lou\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 欣欣向荣的济宁市\n洪沫\n1946-05-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　欣欣向荣的济宁市\n    济宁市位于山东省的西南部，冀鲁豫区的东端，为津浦铁路兖（州）济支线的终点及兖济，济荷（泽），济金（乡），济东（阿），济郓（城）诸公路之中心，运河流经城南，水陆交通都极方便，是鲁西南二十余县之政治、经济、文化中心。全市共有大小街道四百六十余条，人口有十五万之多，为全边区第一大城市，为鲁省第二大城。在敌寇占领期间，曾遭受百般摧残，因此元气大丧，自被八路军于今年一月九日解放后，在民主政府积极实行民主建设，繁荣工商业，减轻人民负担，兴办教育的施政方针下，虽仅历时四月，而全市已呈欣欣向荣的新气象，现将近况介绍于后：\n            商业\n    经过敌寇汉奸八年的压榨统治，济宁市的各种商业异常萧条，全市大小商店倒闭了百分之八十以上，冀南银行济宁支行发放了大批商业贷款，仅四月份商业贷款数额即达一千四百六十一万二千元，各种商业迅速恢复。现已有大小商号四千余家恢复营业，组织了四十三种同业公会。全市各业以皮业为主，鲁西、豫北、苏北二十余县的毛皮都集散于此，战前滑子皮每年可出口四百万张，全市五十家皮行，敌人来后，全部倒闭，目前恢复大宗交易的已有二十家，每天可输出毛皮一万张左右，共值洋七万万元，战前的羊毛交易，当春毛上市时，每天能上七八十万斤，估计今年可恢复战前的一半。其次要算是粮食的交易了，特别是小麦，汶上，金乡，鱼台等小麦产区所产小麦，也都于此集散，现全市共有四个大粮场，其中之一的巴口粮场就有十个大粮行，每日可售出粮食三百石。第三为牲口的交易，从东北来的牲口，也都经过这里；每日可成交三百八十头，合洋四百七十万元，土布的交易，每天达六百万元。商局曾召开全市工商界座谈会，宣布民主政策的经济，免除了各种苛捐杂税，并共同研究出工商建设的方针，现在，八年来不敢进城的老百姓都赶到城里来做买卖，市面愈益兴盛起来。\n            工业\n    济宁市的工业在工商局与晋冀鲁豫贸易总公司济宁第四分公司的扶助下也迅速恢复，电灯、面粉、火柴、蛋厂、铁工等数十家较大的工厂都先后开工。\n    电灯公司在济宁解放的当天晚上，马达声就隆隆的响起来了，使黑暗而死寂的济宁城变成了光明辉煌的城市，该厂现有三百六十匹马力的发电机两部，二号锅炉一座，在全厂职工整夜的努力工作下，可供全市二万三千盏电灯的电力。工人除努力本位工作外，他们正准备修水管子卖水，并经营电料行作为业余生产，此外，公司的盈利，他们还可对半分红。\n    济丰面粉公司在政府的资助下，于四月十日正式开工，现由归济丰先生代表该厂故主刘竹樵与政府订立合同，共同经营，共有资本七千万元（冀钞），日出面粉四万斤，一俟机器修好后，即可日出八万斤，不但可供本市的需要，还可销售于济南、徐州、北平、天津各大城市。全市原有的几家铁厂，敌人在时，大都制造火药等武器，抗战胜利后，边区军工业开始转向制造生产工具，军区军工部即将济宁军火工厂改为工农业制造厂，将原来的翻沙部改为农具制造部，机械部改为机器制造部，火药电气部改为化验部。由于工人和技师的努力，工具制造部已制造铁锅、铁灯、犁滑、车轴，机器部已制出了轧花机，弹花机，轧油器，纺织机，磨粉机，自行车零件等诸小型机器，现正在研究制造卷烟机，制造纽扣机。化验部已开始制造肥皂，并在研究制漂白粉，各部都已正式开工。工人生产情绪高涨万分，他们表示要多生产农具帮助农民进行大生产，更加倍的工作。厂方为扩大生产正号召团体及私人向该厂投资。现该厂大门前每日来往购货者不下数百人，汽车，人力车等车辆络绎不绝，拥挤异常。\n    本市的七家染织业与十七家纸糊业，亦都相继开工。其他如四十家纺织业，制革、肥皂、钢铁等的小型工业均已开工。同新祥等三家机器蛋厂，两家火柴厂以及贫民工厂也正在积极筹设复工。\n            文教\n    随着工商业的大部恢复，人民生活的改善，文教事业亦已开展，书店、印刷业都纷纷复业。济宁日报已于五月一日创刊，由于人力机器的困难，暂出两版，俟数月后对开机及编辑人员齐备后，可日出一报。现全市共有中学三所，学生二千余人，完小九所，初小二十四所，师范一所共有学生六千多人。为开展民众的文化教育，特设立市立图书馆，民众教育馆，公共体育场，职业学校，阅报室，并改良旧剧。\n            交通\n    济宁市的交通建设，自和平后，日益发达，公路，邮政四处畅通。自汽车站成立以来，各线乘客日增，每天开往泰安的三班汽车，乘客有百余人之多，到荷泽，鄄城，嘉祥均每日有车，乘客亦甚拥挤。三月份此项营业收入为四十五万余元，而四月份已增至一百万元以上。现在正赶修济滕（县），济徐（州）两线，并又增加了轿式汽车与小卧车数辆行驶各线，市内公共汽车不日即可开始。自中华邮政局与交通局合并后，来往邮件数量激增，仅四月份内共收进口信十四万一千八百多件，出口信十三万一千七百余件，所发京、沪、平、津、汉口、川、桂等各地邮件均已收到回信与回执。\n            市政\n    本市的市民，在敌伪八年血腥剥削下，备受摧残迫害，多陷于饥寒交迫之境，解放后，我民主政府即拨粮食数十万斤，救济城东，南关遭汉奸刘本功抢劫焚烧的灾区及贫苦市民共一万四千四百七十余人。现各被灾区已全部修复，到处洋溢着和平建设的新气象，受难的市民们已在瓦砾堆上建造了自己的新居。市府为了繁荣市场，整理市容，成立了市政建设委员会，准备在东南关开辟更多的新市场和土货商场。大小街道遍设垃圾箱，每天清道夫洒扫，每日整理公共厕所，给市民注射防疫针，调整井水价格。加强救济工作将原有之残废院，粥厂，寄流所，盲人公所，育儿院，幼稚园都以巨款加以整顿。并以四十万元重修被大汉奸刘本功捣毁的太白楼。市内公园，市府大礼堂以及火柴公司等大小商场也均在筹设中。\n            新生的人们\n    在济宁的粮行，牲口行，草行，布行等市场坐在账房里或站在柜台前的老板，经理们，已再不是那些横眉竖眼的大人先生了，而是翻身后各级会员来管理市场，他们坚决反对营私舞弊的坏人。这些新生的人们，当了主人后，贪污敲诈的不轨行为是根绝了。穷人都有了饭吃，未解放前，只文盛街就有六十家吃豆饼，树叶，整年整月在饥饿中呻吟着，而现在每个贫苦市民最坏的生活，也有足够的高粱面和一些麦面，在街上可以看见许多人换上了新衣，泥水匠郭鸿祥说：“八年来我是第一次穿新衣裳。”王兆泰兴奋的说：“俺过去拉车子一天混的不够一天吃，阴雨天就得挨饿，现在不但够全家生活，还有余粮做买卖。”这些翻身后的贫民都夸耀着自己过着民主、自由的好时光。崔得胜高兴的对记者说：“同志：快把我们的生活都登到报上吧，叫各地的人都知道知道在我们这里穷人都出头了，坏人也都变好了。象文盛街张保林曾当伪军，吸白面喝酒，常打骂母亲，自八路军来后，他就改邪归正了。”在这个新生的一群中，已没有了游手好闲的光棍、流氓和地痞。"

    "content": "[Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 20th] The two Huai salt region, the largest salt field in China, accounts for more than 22 percent of the country's total salt production and supplies salt to over 120 million people. The Huainan salt field (located south of the old Yellow River) was recovered by our army as early as 1941. The Huaibei salt field (located north of the old Yellow River) was only recovered by our army in September of last year. During the eight years of occupation, all production tools such as power plants, water pumps, windmills, waterwheels, channels, gates, reservoirs, evaporation ponds, etc., were completely destroyed by the enemy, and most of the salt farmers fled. After our recovery, the Suwan Border Region Government immediately ordered banks to lend huge sums of money, approximately 3 billion legal tender, to carry out repairs. To date, all production tools have been purchased, and all salt fields have been restored, creating a completely new atmosphere. Work is now underway to dredge the (salt) canal, build drying yards, construct barracks extensively, and replenish shipping docks. Salt farmers who fled during the occupation have returned one after another. Because living conditions have improved and production morale is high, the brine taken in with the tide this year has doubled compared to previous years. Spring sweeping has already begun, and the new salt is snow-white in color and large in grain. The average sodium chloride content is over 90 percent.\n　　[Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 20th] The famous Changlu salt滩 located on the Bohai coast north of Ninghe County. Since eastern Hebei was liberated from the enemy and puppets by the Eighth Route Army last August, loans have been issued, salt workers' lives have been improved, and scientific management has been implemented, resulting in very good conditions. It is estimated that 100 million jin of salt can be produced this year. The main part of the salt滩 is the Hangu salt滩, which includes 34 villages, is over 40 li long, over 20 li wide, and has a total area of approximately 1,750 mu, with over 370 salt灘s. Tens of thousands of salt farmers work here. Before being destroyed by the enemy, it could produce 300 million jin of salt annually, which was transported by sea and land to Tianjin and Hebei and Shanxi provinces. In recent years, it has plummeted. Since the Eighth Route Army liberated the area, the entire salt滩 has been managed by the salt affairs management office established by the democratic government, which is determined to operate it well, help salt farmers organize self-defense groups, and lent each worker 25 jin of millet at the end of last year. Wages have also increased from 12 jin of millet to 16 jin of millet per day. Salt households and workers have signed labor contracts. As workers' lives have improved, production efficiency has also increased. Currently, except for a portion that was destroyed by the Japanese invaders and cannot be opened, 215 have resumed salt production. The Jin-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Government allocated a loan of 50 million border currency (equivalent to 100 million legal tender) and established four sales offices, a saltpeter bureau, and a fish bureau. Three sales offices have already started selling salt, and people come here to transport salt every day in an endless stream. In order to quickly rectify salt affairs and make it an enterprise, the salt affairs office specially organized a salt industry company, solicited private shares, helped old salt households produce salt, and helped workers establish cooperatives to solve shopping difficulties. On September 30 last year, the Kuomintang reactionaries suddenly attacked with a large army and occupied Sai Shang, the center of the Hangu salt灘, occupying two-tenths of it, and 10,000 salt farmers were plunged back into misery. Under the Kuomintang's exorbitant taxes, each \"qing\" of salt costs a minimum of 30 yuan, more than three times the salt price in the liberated areas. When salt households pass by, they are extorted 20 yuan in legal tender by the Kuomintang army as a toll. The people are suffering terribly. On April 21 this year, the Tianjin Kuomintang authorities sent Zhang Xuwu and He Qiwu to negotiate \"takeover\" again. Upon hearing the news, the people immediately rose up in opposition. The Kuomintang reactionaries, with their insatiable greed, sent 320 more troops disguised as salt police to Sai Shang on April 27 and 28, attempting to extend their evil hands into the entire salt滩. The Jidong Eighth Route Army authorities have issued a solemn statement that if the Kuomintang army dares to invade the salt灘, the Eighth Route Army and over 100,000 people will resolutely defend themselves.\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n两淮盐区\tLianghuai yanqu (Two Huai salt region)\n淮南盐场\tHuainan yanchang (Huainan salt field)\n淮北盐场\tHuaibei yanchang (Huaibei salt field)\n苏皖边区政府\tSuwan bianqu zhengfu (Suwan Border Region Government)\n宁河县\tNinghe Xian (Ninghe County)\n长芦盐滩\tChanglu yantan (Changlu salt灘)\n渤海\tBohai\n冀东\tJidong (Eastern Hebei)\n八路军\tBalujun (Eighth Route Army)\n汉沽盐滩\tHangu yantan (Hangu salt灘)\n平津\tPingjin (Beijing and Tianjin)\n冀\tJi (Hebei)\n晋\tJin (Shanxi)\n晋察冀边区政府\tJin-Cha-Ji bianqu zhengfu (Jin-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Government)\n塞上\tSai Shang\n天津\tTianjin\n张旭武\tZhang Xuwu\n何其文\tHe Qiwu\n国民党\tGuomindang (Kuomintang)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 民主政府发放巨大贷款  恢复两淮长芦二大盐场  产盐将可供两万万以上人口食用国民党蓄意破坏盐滩  我将坚决自卫\n\n1946-05-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　民主政府发放巨大贷款\n    恢复两淮长芦二大盐场\n    产盐将可供两万万以上人口食用国民党蓄意破坏盐滩我将坚决自卫\n    【新华社淮阴二十日电】我国第一大盐场两淮盐区，占全国食盐总产量的百分之二十二强，供给食用人口在一万万二千万人以上，其淮南盐场（位于旧黄河以南的），早于三十年为我军收复，淮北盐场（位于旧黄河以北的），于去年九月间始为我军收复。在沦陷八年中，所有生产工具如发电厂、吸水机、风力、水车、沟道、闸门、蓄水池、蒸发池等等，均被敌人破坏无遗，盐民大部逃亡。我收复后，苏皖边区政府，即饬令银行贷放巨款约合法币三十亿元，从事修复，至目前为止，全部生产工具，业已购置齐备，所有盐田，均已修复，气象一新。现正兴工疏浚运（盐）河，建立晒场，普遍建立营房，添补轮船码头。在沦陷期间逃亡的盐民，均纷纷迁回，因现在生活改善，生产情绪颇高，故今年以潮水取进之卤汁，较往年增加一倍。春扫现已开始，新盐色泽雪白，颗粒亦大，平均氯化钠含量均在百分之九十以上。\n    【新华社遵化二十日电】位于宁河县北渤海之滨的我国著名长芦盐滩，自去年八月冀东为八路军从敌伪手中解放后，即发放贷款，改善盐工生活，并加以科学管理，情形极为良好，预计今年可产盐十万万斤。该盐滩中主要为汉沽盐滩，包括三十四个村庄，长四十余里，宽二十余里，总面积约一千七百五十多顷，有三百七十多个盐滩。数万盐民在此从事劳作。在未被敌人破坏之前，年可产盐三十万万斤，由海陆两路运往平津及冀、晋各地。近数年来，即一落千丈。自从八路军解放后，整个盐滩由民主政府设立盐务管理处，锐意经营，帮助盐民组织自卫团，去年年底贷给每个工人小米二十五斤，工资亦由每天小米十二斤增至十六斤。灶户与工人订立劳资合同，工人因生活改善，生产效率随之提高，现除被日寇破坏的一部分尚不能开滩外，已有二百一十五个恢复产盐。晋察冀边区政府拨贷款边币五千万元（折合法币一万万元），设立了四个推销处，一个硝磺局，一个鱼局，现已有三个推销处，开始卖盐，每日来此运盐者，络绎不绝，为了迅速整顿盐务，使之企业化，盐务处特组织盐业公司，招集私股，帮助旧有灶户制盐，并帮助工人成立合作社，解决购物困难。去年九月三十日，国民党反动派，竟突然以大军袭击，占领了汉沽盐滩中心塞上整个盐湾，被其占去十分之二，有一万盐民，重陷苦海。在国民党苛捐杂税下，每擎盐最低为三十元，超过解放区盐价三倍以上。当盐户过路时，即被国民党军勒索二十元法币的买路钱，人民痛苦不堪。今年四月二十一日，天津国民党当局又派张旭武、何其文前来谈判“接收”，人民闻讯，即一致起来反对。国民党反动派贪心不死，遂于四月二十七、八两日，伪装盐警，在塞上增兵三百二十余人，企图将魔手伸入整个盐滩。冀东八路军当局，为此已发出郑重声明，若国民党军胆敢侵犯盐滩，八路军与十余万人民，将坚决自卫。"

    "content": "[Xinhua News Agency Yangcheng Dispatch] The Kuomintang reactionaries, in violation of the Heze River Management Agreement, are plotting to release water to flood our Jiluyu Liberated Area, and are using this to provoke the relationship between the people of Jilu provinces and Henan province. To this end, this reporter specifically visited Mr. Gao Yanliu, the person in charge of the Henan Democratic National Construction Association, who gave the following statement. Mr. Gao first pointed out: \"In the 27th year of the Republic of China [1938], the Kuomintang army was corrupt and incompetent, attempting to use the Yellow River water to stop the enemy, using the lives and property of the people of Henan as a bet, causing the submergence of sixteen counties in Henan and Anhui provinces, resulting in the deaths of more than 300,000 people and the loss of homes for six million people, but in the end, they did not stop the enemy. The people of Henan will never forget the disaster caused by this kind of昏聩(hun kui - muddle-headed) actions of the Kuomintang.\" Mr. Gao continued: \"The Kuomintang authorities usually do not care about the new flooded areas of Henan, which is enough to prove that their eagerness to close the breach and return the river to its original course is not mainly to benefit the people of Henan and eliminate harm, but to cooperate with their conspiracy to launch a civil war. Therefore, from the standpoint of the people of Henan, we fully support the Heze Agreement, to restore the dikes first and then close the breach, and at the same time, the new embankments in Henan should be properly built to prevent the expansion of the new flooded area, and the victims in the new flooded area should be actively relieved.\" Speaking of the Kuomintang's malicious provocations, he said that provoking dissension, creating hatred between the people, and dividing the unity of the people are the tricks that the Kuomintang reactionaries always use, but the eyes of the people of Henan are bright, and they will certainly not be exploited by the reactionaries. Today, the correct policy of the people of Henan is: to closely unite with the people of Jilu provinces, to oppose the reactionaries' conspiracy for civil war, to achieve a long-term and stable river management method, so that the people of the three provinces will never suffer from the Yellow River disaster again. Our Henan Democratic National Construction Association is willing to make every effort to fight for this goal.\"\n    [Xinhua News Agency Handan, 19th Dispatch] The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Area Council and the Border Area Government, concerning Mr. Tarde, an American technical advisor from UNRRA, assisting the Kuomintang reactionaries in destroying the Heze River Management Agreement and endangering the lives and property of seven million people along the river, have telegraphed President Truman and the American people, requesting them to persuade Mr. Tarde to stop this behavior.

The US representative, Acheson, believed that the letter contained signs of communist propaganda and that the council should not support it. The British representative, Ball, interjected, saying, \"Assuming that the Communist Party is legal in Japan, then it has the right to conduct propaganda.\" Acheson then said, \"MacArthur Headquarters will investigate whether the matters listed in the letter are facts,\" and asked the Soviet representative how he knew that everything stated in the letter was \"fact.\" The Soviet representative countered by asking Acheson how he knew it was not a fact, and stated that the letter represented the opinions of the 600,000 people who participated in the May Day demonstration in Tokyo.

They have organized joint defenses and strengthened the militia. Enthusiastic gatherings have been held in various places to study methods of preventing and capturing special agents. Village cadres from twenty villages in the wasteland area of Guan County held a meeting on April 22nd to discuss methods of using night watchmen to prevent special agents. They decided that the entire wasteland area should be a joint defense zone, establishing a joint defense brigade, with the twenty villages assisting each other and conducting mutual inspections between villages, and rewarding active night watchmen. The Wei County Military Committee used the time the militia were building dikes to strengthen current affairs education and special agent prevention education. On April 30th, the head of Wucheng County personally led the militia to capture nineteen special agents, seizing more than ten guns and six hundred rounds of ammunition. On April 25th, the people's armed forces of En County completely eliminated eleven members of the assassination squad led by Jin Jinbang, the second battalion commander directly under the traitor Sun Guangtao of Dezhou.

    "content": "Jinnan Bank Handan City Business Regulations\n    (A) Deposits\n    1. Fixed Deposits\n    I. Interest (calculated as simple interest) and terms are divided into four types:\n    For terms of three months or more, the interest rate (monthly interest) is 2.5%.\n    For terms of six months or more, the interest rate (monthly interest) is 3%.\n    For terms of nine months or more, the interest rate (monthly interest) is 3.5%.\n    For terms of one year or more, the interest rate (monthly interest) is 4%.\n    II. To benefit depositors, the interest rate will increase during the extended term for those who extend their deposits upon maturity. (For example, if the original term was six months and is extended for three months, the interest rate for those three months will be calculated according to the nine-month rate of 3.5%, and so on.)\n    III. Deposits and withdrawals are based on the bank's deposit slips. (If a deposit slip is lost, it can be handled according to the bank's procedure for reporting losses and obtaining replacements.)\n    IV. If a depositor urgently needs funds and the deposit has not yet matured, the deposit slip can be used as collateral to obtain a loan from the bank. However, the loan amount shall not exceed 80% of the original deposit amount, and the term shall not exceed the maturity date of the deposit.\n    2. Current Deposits. I. General depositors deposit and withdraw using a passbook. II. Those with frequent transactions deposit and withdraw using checks and passbooks. III. No interest is paid for accounts closed within five days. IV. Each deposit must be at least 500 yuan. V. The deposit interest is calculated at a daily rate of 0.5%. VI. Those who have entered into an overdraft agreement may overdraw; the maximum overdraft amount shall not exceed the original deposit amount, and interest shall be calculated based on industrial and commercial lending rates. (Those with frequent transactions will be discussed separately.)\n    3. Savings Deposits\n    I. The minimum deposit is 100 yuan, and there is no limit to the maximum. (Lump-sum withdrawal from regular savings)\n    II. Deposits must be made once a month without interruption. If deposits are skipped for two months, the account will be transferred to a current deposit account.\n    III. Deposits made before the 5th of each month will accrue interest from that month; deposits made after the 5th will accrue interest from the following month.\n    IV. This type of deposit is divided into two types: six months and one year. For a term of one year, the monthly interest rate is 5%, and for a term of six months, the monthly interest rate is 4.5%, calculated as compound interest; paid in full upon maturity.\n    V. If a depositor is transferred for official duties or has a wedding or funeral, interest can be withdrawn at any time based on the current deposit rate, upon providing proof.\n    (B) Loans\n    1. Industrial and Commercial Loans\n    Regardless of the form of credit guarantee or collateral, all borrowers must sign a contract. The procedures are as follows:\n    I. Fixed-term loans: The maximum term shall not exceed six months, and the interest rate shall be calculated at a monthly rate of 2% to 7%. To benefit customers, it is specifically stipulated that interest will be reduced for those who return the loan before the maturity date; interest will be calculated for one month if the loan is repaid before one month, and for two months if the loan is repaid before two months.\n    II. Current loans: To appropriately regulate finance and take care of the interests of more people, this type of loan will have an approximate repayment period agreed upon in advance before the loan is issued. Within this period, customers can repay freely, and interest will be calculated daily at a daily rate of 0.1% to 0.3%.\n    The interest rates for the above two types of loans will be adjusted according to the profit margin of the customer's business.\n    2. Small Loans (i.e., Loans for Poor Urban Residents)\n    (1) Monthly interest rate of 1% to 1.5%.\n    (2) Introduced and guaranteed by mass organizations (such as the National Salvation Association, trade unions, federations, and citizen representative conferences).\n    (3) The loan amount per household ranges from 1,000 yuan to a maximum of 10,000 yuan.\n    (C) Remittances\n    I. The remittance network covers 26 locations throughout the border region; the place names will be announced separately.\n    II. Types: Divided into draft remittance and telegraphic remittance.\n    III. Remittance amount: Each remittance must be at least 1,000 yuan and no more than 200,000 yuan. For amounts exceeding 200,000 yuan, remittances can be made in installments.\n    IV. Handling fee: To benefit customers, no remittance fee will be charged for any remittance; only a handling fee of 0.5% to 1% will be charged.\n    V. Reporting loss: To protect remitters from unexpected losses, if a customer accidentally loses a remittance draft or experiences other changes (water damage, fire damage, etc.) and is unable to withdraw funds, they can request a \"non-payment certificate\" from the deposit bank (if lost, it must be declared invalid in the newspaper) and then apply for a new draft at the original remitting bank. However, the bank will not be responsible if the remittance has already been claimed by someone else.\n    (D) Industrial and Commercial Investment (Discussed and handled on a temporary basis through contracts)\n    (E) Exchange: Accepting the exchange of raw gold and silver and other currency instruments:\n    I. Exchange rates will be posted and priced at any time.\n    II. The currency or instruments to be exchanged must be handled through the government or the Bureau of Industry and Commerce.

After the JCP and various democratic parties led over ten thousand people in holding three demonstrations in one day on the 17th, the JCP issued a statement stating: Yoshida was once the Foreign Minister of the Tanaka Cabinet, and Tanaka personally formulated the plan for Japanese imperialism to conquer China and even the entire world. Therefore, we believe that the new cabinet is a military clique cabinet. The Mainichi Shimbun stated: We hope that the new cabinet members can faithfully represent the strength of all parties participating in politics.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] Moscow's radio commentator Masinu commented today on the Tokyo trial of Japanese war criminals, stating: The defense attorneys are attacking the court with two aims: one is to attempt to delay the trial, at least by two months; the other is to attempt to prove that this court does not seem to have the right to try these criminals who oppose peace and endanger humanity, and does not seem to be able to equate them with the Germans. The Japanese lawyers have strong backing behind them, so they dare to take such vile and shameless actions. They want to turn the war crimes tribunal into a fascist platform for the Yamato nation, defending Japanese militarists, deceiving the people, in order to preserve their prestige and power among the people. The shameless behavior of the Japanese lawyers in court is closely linked to the activation of reactionary forces in Japan.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] Acheson, the US representative to the Allied Council for Japan, issued a statement on the 15th, denouncing the protest letter submitted to the Council by the masses of the May 1st demonstration in Japan as \"communist propaganda,\" and declaring: \"The United States does not want to see communism appear in the United States or Japan.\" Tokuda, Secretary of the JCP, issued a solemn statement on the 16th, saying: The JCP and himself had long anticipated Acheson's statement, which is actually the inevitable result of the US's stance. Acheson's statement that the US does not want to see Japan implement communism will not cause any modification to the JCP's plan. Only the JCP can solve the food crisis in Japan, and the JCP's current goal is to establish a democratic Japan.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\nPeople:\n\n吉田    Yoshida\n德田    Tokuda\n阿契生  Acheson\n田中    Tanaka\n马西努  Masinu\n\nPlaces:\n\n东京    Tokyo\n延安    Yan'an\n莫斯科  Moscow\n中国    China\n日本    Japan\n美国    United States\n云南    Yunnan\n\nOrganizations:\n\n日共    Japanese Communist Party (JCP)\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n每日新闻  Mainichi Shimbun\n田中内阁  Tanaka Cabinet\n对日委员会  Allied Council for Japan\n\nEvents:\n\n五一示威  May 1st demonstration\n东京审判  Tokyo Trial\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 反对吉田军阀内阁  东京万余群众大示威  德田指斥阿契生污蔑日共\n\n1946-05-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　反对吉田军阀内阁\n    东京万余群众大示威\n    德田指斥阿契生污蔑日共\n    【新华社延安二十日电】东京讯：吉田自十六日登台以来，就不断受到日共及各民主党派、广大人民以及日本舆论的攻击，日共与各民主党派于十七日领导万余人民，举行一日三起之示威后，日共又发表声明称：吉田曾是田中内阁的外相，而田中曾亲订日本帝国主义征服中国以至全世界的计划，因此我们认为新内阁是军阀内阁。每日新闻称：吾人望新阁人选，能忠实代表参与政事各党之实力。\n    【新华社延安廿日电】莫斯科今日广播评论员马西努评东京审判日本战犯称：辩护人问法庭进攻有二个目的，一是企图使法庭拖延审判，至少拖延二个月；另一是企图证明这一法庭，似乎没有权利审判这些反对和平，危害人类的罪犯，似乎不能把他们与德国人混为一谈。日本律师背后有坚固的靠山，因此敢于作这样下贱无耻的行动，他们想把审判战犯的法庭变成大和民族的法西斯主义的讲坛，为日本军阀辩护，欺骗人民，以保存他们在人民中的威信及势力。日本律师在法庭上的无耻行为，是与日本反动势力在国内的积极化有其密切的联系。\n    【新华社延安二十日电】对日委员会美代表阿契生，十五日曾发表声明，对日本五一示威群众向委员会所提抗议书，污蔑为“共产党之宣传”，并宣称：“美国并不愿见共产党主义之出现于美国或日本”。日共书记德田十六日对此发表郑重声明说：日共及其本人，对阿契生之声明早已预料到，这实为美所持立场之必然结果。阿氏所谓美不愿见日本实行共产党主义一节，不能使日共之计划因此有何修正，在日本只有日共才能解决粮食危机，日共之当前目的为建立民主的日本。"

    "content": "Heshun's mutual aid production movement has now exceeded any previous year. Out of the county's 202 administrative villages, 21,252 households, and 83,724 people, 14,172 households, or 28,910 people, have been organized. The number of people participating in mutual aid accounts for more than 34% of the county's population. The county currently has 6 mutual aid societies, 122 labor exchange teams, and 1,749 mutual aid groups. According to the degree of organization, the villages can be divided into three categories: 88 villages where rent reduction has been relatively thorough, the masses are highly aware, and they recognize the importance of organizing production, so mutual aid organizations are also relatively consolidated. In 75 villages, rent reduction still has outstanding problems and is not thorough enough, the masses have poor awareness, and mutual aid is mostly organized by cadres through administrative means. In addition, there are 39 villages where rent reduction is very incomplete, and the masses have low enthusiasm for production. Therefore, in the midst of the great production campaign, the county is still combining it with rent reduction, hoping to implement rent reduction thoroughly and further organize the masses.\n　　[Our Yangcheng Dispatch] The Second District of Qin County inspected the district's production work on April 16th. The inspection results are as follows: (1) A total of 157 mutual aid groups have been organized throughout the district, with 1,193 people. Among them, the development is most widespread in the six villages of Xilin, Northwest, Hougou, Beiji, Wusu, and Gu County Town. Xilin is better than the other villages. The village has organized 13 groups, with 78 people, accounting for more than 80% of the male able-bodied labor force in the village. The method of organization is voluntary association. Wang Binghe, Wang Xinghe and others combine groups according to their close proximity to their residence, calling on everyone to organize mutual aid. From the group develops into a brigade. The village has elected Wang Binghe as the brigade leader to lead the village's mutual aid group to carry out production. Secondly, the mutual aid groups of Jiang Haijin and Huang Gengyou in Gu County Town, and the Wang Xingyuan mutual aid group in Beiji, are also developing well. (2) In the popularization of cotton planting, they first carried out cotton seed regulation. In addition to the government's assistance in regulating 6,000 jin, they also called on the masses to personally transport 6,300 jin of raw cotton seeds from Huo County. They have all been planted, totaling 5,131 mu of cotton. Among them, the six villages of Northwest, Nanji, Shangzhuang, Nanren, Guozhuang, Houquan, and Liancun have planted the most cotton. Northwest Liancun alone planted more than 600 mu. A small village, Shigou, with 16 households, planted 55 mu, an average of 2 mu per household. The task of one mu per household on average in the district has been fully completed. In terms of technical guidance for cotton planting, the district cotton planting instructor holds meetings with village instructors seasonally to study specific matters and personally goes to the countryside to experiment and guide. (3) To promote the \"Golden Queen\" corn and increase yields, they first carried out seed regulation. It is planned that the district will plant a total of 2,119 mu of \"Golden Queen\" this year. Xilin plans to completely switch the village's corn to \"Golden Queen,\" totaling 300 mu. Calculating an increase of 5 dou per mu, the district can increase production by 1,059 shi and 5 dou. (4) During the Qingming Festival, people were called to plant trees, guaranteeing that each person would keep one alive. However, because the trees were cut down when the enemy was stationed in Yu'ao Manshui, except for the stationed villages of Xiazhuang, Guozhuang, Nanzhuang, Nanren, and Gu County Town, there was a shortage of trees to plant. According to district statistics, a total of 10,431 trees were planted, with an average of one tree planted for every two people. Among them, Gu County Town carried out collective afforestation, planting more than 1,000 trees on Zishan Mountain. An Baolin, from Wu Ke Village, planted 110 trees alone. (5) For spring plowing loans, the Eighth District loaned a total of 580,000 yuan. According to statistics, 22% was used for agricultural tools, 54% for draft animals, and 4% for fertilizer. Xilin Village loaned 22,000 yuan and bought 7 oxen. The district loaned a total of 68 oxen. In terms of loan methods, the masses organized spring loan committees, determined and posted public notices, and then the masses discussed and proposed opinions. The objects of the loans were mostly poor peasants, families of martyrs, and honored soldiers. The number of loan households has exceeded 20% of the total number of households in the village.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n和顺县\tHeshun Xian\n沁县\tQin Xian\n长治\tChangzhi\n阳城\tYangcheng\n西林\tXilin\n西北\tXibei\n后沟\tHougou\n北集\tBeiji\n乌苏\tWusu\n故县镇\tGu Xian Zhen\n王丙和\tWang Binghe\n王兴和\tWang Xinghe\n姜海金\tJiang Haijin\n黄更友\tHuang Gengyou\n王兴元\tWang Xingyuan\n霍县\tHuo Xian\n南集\tNanji\n上庄\tShangzhuang\n南仁\tNanren\n郭庄\tGuozhuang\n后泉\tHouquan\n联村\tLiancun\n寺沟\tSigou\n金皇后\tGolden Queen\n寺沟\tSigou\n下庄\tXiazhuang\n南庄\tNanzhuang\n余凹漫水\tYu'ao Manshui\n紫山\tZishan\n五科村\tWu Ke Cun\n安保林\tAn Baolin\n清明节 Qingming Festival\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 和顺经过减租  互助生产超过往年  群运未深入村生产劲头不大  沁县二区检查全区生产\n\n1946-05-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　和顺经过减租\n    互助生产超过往年\n    群运未深入村生产劲头不大\n    沁县二区检查全区生产\n    【本报长治讯】和顺县互助生产运动，目前已超过以往任何一年。全县二百零二个行政村，二万一千二百五十二户，八万三千七百二十四个人中，组织起来的已有一万四千一百七十二户，二万八千九百一十人，参加互助人数，占全县人口百分之三十四强。全县现共有互助社六个，拨工队一百二十二个，互助小组一千七百四十九个。按组织起来的程度，可分为三类村：有八十八村减租已较彻底，群众觉悟较高，认识了组织生产的重要，互助组织亦较巩固。七十五个村减租尚有遗留问题不够深入，群众觉悟较差，互助多系干部包办搞起来的。此外尚有三十九个村减租很不彻底，群众的生产情绪不高。故该县在大生产中，目前仍结合着减租，以期贯彻减租，进一步组织起来。\n    【本报阳城讯】沁县二区于四月十六号检查全区生产工作，检查结果如下：（一）全区共已组织互助组一百五十七个，一千一百九十三人，其中以西林、西北、后沟、北集、乌苏、故县镇等六村发展的最普遍。西林又较其他村为好，该村共组织十三组，人数七十八人，占该村男全劳动力百分之八十以上。组织的办法是自愿结合，由王丙和、王兴和等二人按居住邻近结合小组，号召大家组织互助，由小组发展成为大队，现该村已选出王丙和为大队长领导全村互助组，进行生产。其次，故县镇姜海金、黄更有的互助组，北集王兴元互助组，也比较发展的好。（二）在普及植棉上，他们首先进行了棉籽调剂，除政府帮助调剂六千斤外，并号召群众亲往霍县运生棉籽六千三百斤，现已全部下种，共计种棉五千一百三十一亩，其中以西北、南集、上庄、南仁、郭庄、后泉、联村等六村种棉最多，只西北联村即种了六百多亩，寺沟一个小庄十六户人家，就种了五十五亩，每户平均二亩，全区平均每户一亩的任务，已全部完成。在植棉技术指导上，由区植棉指导员，按季节召开村指导员会议，具体研究，并亲自下乡实验指导。（三）推广金皇后玉茭，增加产量，首先进行了种子的调剂，计划今年全区共种金皇后两千一百一十九亩，西林计划全村玉茭完全改种金皇后，计三百亩，以每亩多打五斗计，全区可增产量一千零五十九石五斗。（四）清明号召植树，每人保证栽活一棵，但因敌驻余凹漫水时，树被砍光，除下庄、郭庄、南庄、南仁、故县镇驻村外，都是缺乏树栽，全区统计，共植树一万零四百三十一棵，每两口人平均植树一株，其中故县镇集体造林，在紫山上植树一千余棵，五科村安保林一人，即植树一百一十棵。（五）春耕贷款，八区共贷五十八万元，据统计，用在农具上占百分之二十二，耕畜占百分之五十四，肥料占百分之四，西林全村贷款两万二千元，即买耕牛七头。全区共贷耕牛六十八头。在贷款办法上，都是由群众组织春贷委员会，计定挂榜公布，再由群众讨论提意见，决定对象多是贫苦农民、抗属、荣誉军人，贷款户已超过全村户数百分之二十。"

    "content": "【New China News Agency, Changchun, 21st Dispatch】After the Kuomintang reactionaries occupied Fushun, remnant enemy and puppet forces once again raised their heads, and the city's residents were plunged back into a dark abyss. Guo Sheng, a puppet police officer during the puppet Manchukuo regime, bought the position of Director of the Fushun Public Security Bureau for 1.7 million yuan. Hua Yuting, a major drug dealer during the puppet Manchukuo regime and the \"Opium Combination Chief,\" bought the rank of Kuomintang army colonel for one million yuan. Xu Changchun, the puppet police chief who had been wanted by the democratic government, also returned to Fushun with a mission. Leading the army, they arrested people everywhere. Within a month, the \"National Army\" had illegally arrested over 400 workers, staff, and students in Fushun. On March 15th, a righteous woman who had worked for the democratic government was arrested, paraded through the streets bound, and forced to say bad things about the Democratic Allied Army and the Communist Party, but she sternly refused. She said: \"Even if you shoot me, I will never say a bad word about the Eighth Route Army or the Communist Party. I firmly oppose your autocracy and dictatorship!\" Household registration was checked everywhere in the city, pedestrians were inspected, and people were asked to produce the \"good citizen certificates\" from the puppet Manchukuo regime. Laborers were forcibly conscripted day and night to build bunkers and gun emplacements, with each \"group\" forced to provide five laborers daily for more than eleven hours of labor. The officers are busy making money, they shipped large quantities of heroin and opium from Qinhuangdao and ordered local residents to buy them. Due to the excessive issuance of banknotes, prices have soared, generally several times higher than in the Democratic Allied Army-controlled areas outside the city. Grain is particularly expensive. For example, in early April, sorghum in the city cost 12.5 yuan per catty in puppet Manchukuo currency, while in the Democratic Allied Army defense area outside the city, it cost only two yuan per catty. The people of Fushun, unable to bear the oppression, have been fleeing to the Democratic Allied Army garrison.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n抚顺\tFushun\n郭生\tGuo Sheng\n华雨亭\tHua Yuting\n鸦片烟组合长  Opium Combination Chief\n徐长春  Xu Changchun\n秦皇岛  Qinhuangdao\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n长春\tChangchun\n民主联军  Democratic Allied Army\n共产党   Communist Party\n国军  National Army\n伪满  Puppet Manchukuo\n良民证  good citizen certificates\n第八路军  Eighth Route Army\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党进占后  抚顺重陷黑暗深渊  民不堪命纷纷逃向解放区\n\n1946-05-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党进占后\n    抚顺重陷黑暗深渊\n    民不堪命纷纷逃向解放区\n    【新华社长春二十一日电】国民党反动派进占抚顺后，敌伪残余势力，重又抬头，市民再被投入了黑暗深渊。伪满时，抚顺市伪警察官郭生，以一百七十万元买得抚顺市公安局长，伪满时，大毒品贩“鸦片烟组合长”华雨亭，以百万元买得国军上校官职，曾为民主政府通缉的伪警察署长徐长春，亦负有任务，回至抚顺。他们领着军队，到处捕人，一个月内“国军”在抚顺已非法逮捕工人职员学生达四百余人。三月十五日，抓去曾在民主政府工作的一个具有正义感的妇女，被捆绑游街，并强迫她讲民主联军与共产党的坏话，但遭严词拒绝。她说：“你们枪毙了我，我也决不说八路军、共产党一句坏话。我坚决反对你们的专制独裁！”市内到处清查户口，检查行人，并向人民索取伪满的良民证，日夜抽抓劳工，修筑碉堡炮台，强迫每“组”每天去五个劳工，从事十一小时以上的劳役。军官们忙着发财，他们从秦皇岛运来大批海洛因和鸦片，勒令当地居民购买。由于滥发钞票，促使物价狂涨，一般比市外民主联军所在地高过数倍，尤以粮食最为昂贵，如四月上旬，市内高粱每斤伪满币十二元五角，而市外民主联军防区，每斤只二元，抚顺人民不堪压榨，已纷纷向民主联军驻地逃奔。"

On the 11th, two regiments of the 71st Division stationed in Yangqu, along with the 46th Division stationed in Xiangyangdian, totaling over 2,000 men, attacked our Wangfeng Town (about 20 li northwest of Yangqu). Another part of the 71st Division, in coordination with about 200 Japanese soldiers, attacked our Beige Town (about 10 li north of Xugou). At the same time, Yang Yun led over 300 puppet troops, departing from Taiyuan via Xiaodian, and invaded Beige Town, subsequently occupying Chen Town. On the morning of the 13th, over 500 Yan soldiers from Dui Jiuyu in Xiaoyi, with one heavy artillery piece and one mortar, advanced in two routes towards our Xiabao (about 20 li west of Xiaoyi) and Shixiang. After the Yan soldiers attacking Shixiang were repelled, they turned to attack Xiabao, firing over 30 artillery shells at our defending troops, charging three times without success.

Since the United States proposed that it should obtain sovereignty over three British islands in the Southwest Pacific, it has aroused opposition from British newspapers. Subsequently, the British government also conditionally rejected this U.S. demand. According to Reuters, it is rumored that British Foreign Secretary Bevin informed U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes in Paris that if the United States is willing to jointly participate in the South Pacific with Britain and New Zealand, the British government may be willing to give these three islands to the United States as bases; however, this does not include so-called British abandonment of sovereignty over the area, and Britain can still use the area as a base at the same time. According to a London dispatch from Marshall, a reporter for the Chicago Sun, Britain and the United States have engaged in secret negotiations on the future of Japan, but the opinions of the two countries are very different. Britain believes that the United States is being too lenient with Japanese industry. Britain advocates that Japan's shipbuilding industry must be completely prohibited, or the equipment that could be used to build ocean-going ships must be prohibited, but the United States insists on its established policy.\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n延安    Yan'an\n英国    Britain\n美国    United States\n太平洋  Pacific Ocean\n日本    Japan\n路透社  Reuters\n英国外相  British Foreign Secretary\n贝文    Bevin\n美国国务卿  U.S. Secretary of State\n贝纳斯  Byrnes\n巴黎   Paris\n新西兰  New Zealand\n芝加哥太阳报 Chicago Sun\n马氏  Marshall\n伦敦  London\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 对太平洋战略岛屿  英美继续发生争执\n\n1946-05-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　对太平洋战略岛屿\n    英美继续发生争执\n    【新华社延安二十日电】最近英美对太平洋战略岛屿的处理，与日本之未来问题，继续发生争执，自美国提出应获得西南太平洋英三个岛屿的主权后，曾引起英国各报的反对，继之英政府亦有条件的拒绝美国此种要求。据路透社称：传闻英外相贝文在巴黎曾通知美国务卿贝纳斯称：如果美国愿意与英国及新西兰共同参加南太平洋，英政府可能愿将此三岛给予美国作为基地；但这并不包括所谓英国放弃该地主权，而且英国同时仍能利用该地作为基地。另据芝加哥太阳报记者马氏伦敦讯：英美已就日本之未来问题，从事秘密谈判，然两国意见殊为分歧。英认为美对日本工业过分宽大，英主张日本之造船工业必须完全禁止或禁止其可能建造远洋船只之设备，但美国则坚持既定政策。"

On the south side of the railway, they are attacking the heartland region between Taikang, Qi County, and Sui County, where they rape, loot, and kill the people wherever they go. In the villages of Changgong and Wagang, southwest of Sui County, over twenty people were killed. From the 8th to the 15th, the Yan (jin) Qi (county) Ji (county) Security Brigade and puppet troops of Li Ying, Wang Sanzhu, and others on the east side of the Pinghan Railway successively occupied over ten strategic points in our Hua County, including the Niushitun livestock market and its surrounding areas. The Guomindang troops and puppet troops stationed in Changyuan and Laocheng have prepared a week's worth of dry rations and shoes, and have gathered a large number of civilian laborers. It is reliably learned that these troops will mobilize within one to two days to occupy the Liberated Area between Changyuan and Hua County in northeastern Henan, and will further occupy the entire southern border of our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region north of the Longhai Railway, in coordination with their \"suppression\" forces in eastern Henan to eliminate our Eastern Henan Liberated Area. Recently, the puppet troops of Du Shu in Dongming have been unusually arrogant, claiming that they will \"cooperate with the old Central Army to eliminate the bandit area.\" The comprehensive offensive of the Guomindang troops and puppet troops against our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region is about to begin. Currently, the people of the entire border region are outraged and unanimously demand that our army resolutely strike against the aggressive flames of the Guomindang reactionaries.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 21st Dispatch] On the 15th, Guomindang troops and puppet troops on the east side of the Pinghan Railway invaded six villages and towns in the Northern Henan Liberated Area. On the 15th, a battalion of the 68th Army of the Guomindang in Yanjin, in coordination with the 2nd Security Regiment of the Guomindang stationed in Yuanwu, Yangwu, and Yanjin, invaded Weiqiuji, 20 li northeast of Yanjin. On the same day, puppet troops under Wang Delin invaded Niushitun, northwest of Changyuan, and puppet troops under Liu Mingde invaded Longmiao, over 20 li southwest of Niushitun. The Yan (jin) Qi (county) Ji (county) Security Brigade under Liu Fengchao also invaded Wangbao Village, 15 li west of Niushitun, on the same day. Puppet troops under Wang Yuzhu occupied Niuguangxiang Temple, 20 li southeast of Niushitun. The local Guomindang troops in Changyuan under He Guansan, numbering over 3,000, are currently rushing to build fortifications in the above-mentioned occupied areas, carrying over a hundred civilian laborers, preparing to invade again.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Nangong, 20th Dispatch] The puppet troops under renegade Yuan Yanchou, renegade Han Maozai, renegade Pang Changshen, and renegade Yang Jingzhai, entrenched around Changqing and Qihe, have launched 146 attacks against the Liberated Area since the ceasefire order, using a force of 27,570 men, killing over 70 village cadres and civilians in our area, capturing 127 people, and devastating over 240 villages.\n    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 21st Dispatch] The Eastern Henan Group of the Xinxiang Central Executive Group, which has been repeatedly obstructed by Zhao Zili, Chief of Staff of the Guomindang Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters, and Liu Ruming, Director of the Kaifeng Sixth Pacification Area, traveled between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng from the 11th to the 18th. On the 18th, the Guomindang representative suddenly told the American and Communist representatives of the Eastern Henan Group that \"if you insist on going to eastern Henan for investigation, the Guomindang army cannot guarantee the safety of the group.\" After being threatened, the group was forced to return to Xinxiang on the 19th. This shows the determination of the Guomindang army to expand the civil war and attack our Eastern Henan Liberated Area.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n人物 People:\n\n李英    Li Ying\n王三珠  Wang Sanzhu\n杜淑    Du Shu\n王德林  Wang Delin\n刘明德  Liu Mingde\n刘凤朝  Liu Fengchao\n王玉珠  Wang Yuzhu\n何冠三  He Guansan\n袁砚秋  Yuan Yanchou\n韩茂才  Han Maozai\n庞长申  Pang Changshen\n杨静斋  Yang Jingzhai\n赵子立  Zhao Zili\n刘汝明  Liu Ruming\n\n地点 Places:\n\n平汉路   Pinghan Railway\n冀鲁豫区  Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region\n豫东解放区 Eastern Henan Liberated Area\n夏邑    Xiayi\n萧县    Xiaoxian\n陇海路   Longhai Railway\n太康    Taikang\n杞县    Qi County\n睢县    Sui County\n长岗    Changgong\n瓦岗    Wagang\n延津    Yanjin\n淇县    Qi County\n汲县    Ji County\n滑县    Hua County\n牛市屯  Niushitun\n长垣    Changyuan\n老城    Laocheng\n东明    Dongming\n豫北解放区 Northern Henan Liberated Area\n魏邱集   Weiqiuji\n原武    Yuanwu\n阳武    Yangwu\n龙庙    Longmiao\n王堡村   Wangbao Village\n牛馆相寺 Niuguangxiang Temple\n长清    Changqing\n齐河    Qihe\n郑州    Zhengzhou\n开封    Kaifeng\n新乡    Xinxiang\n\n组织 Organizations:\n\n国民党    Guomindang\n新华社 Xinhua News Agency\n郑州绥靖公署 Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters\n开封第六绥靖区  Kaifeng Sixth Pacification Area\n新乡中心执行小组 Xinxiang Central Executive Group\n\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 平汉路东国民党军蠢动  妄图进攻冀鲁豫区  全区人民愤慨万状要求坚决抗击\n\n1946-05-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　平汉路东国民党军蠢动\n    妄图进攻冀鲁豫区\n    全区人民愤慨万状要求坚决抗击\n    【本报邯郸二十一日讯】国民党军进占我豫东解放区的夏邑与苏北之萧县两城后（均在陇海路南），即积极向北挺进，路南方面，正进攻我太康、杞县、睢县间腹心地区，所到之处，奸淫掳掠，残杀人民，在睢县西南之长岗、瓦岗两村即被杀二十余人。平汉东侧延（津）淇（县）汲（县）保安旅与伪军李英、王三珠等部自八日起至十五日，先后占我滑县之牛市屯及其四周各战略要点等十余处，驻长垣、老城之国民党军与伪军已准备好一周干粮、鞋子，并集中大量民夫，据确悉：该军将于一二日内出动攻占我东北长垣滑县间的解放区，并进而将陇海路北我冀鲁豫区南境全部占领，以配合其豫东“进剿”之部队肃清我豫东解放区。近日东明伪军杜淑部异常嚣张，扬言“配合老中央军清剿匪区”。国民党军与伪军对我冀鲁豫区的全面进攻即将开始，现全边区人民愤慨万状，一致要求我军坚决打击国民党反动派进攻凶焰。\n    【新华社邯郸二十一日电】平汉路东侧国民党军及伪军，十五日侵占豫北解放区村镇六处。十五日，延津国民党六十八军一个营，配合驻原武、阳武、延津之国民党保安二团，侵占延津东北二十里之魏邱集。同日，伪军王德林部侵占长垣西北之牛市屯，伪军刘明德部侵占牛市屯西南二十余里之龙庙。延（津）淇（县）汲（县）保安旅刘凤朝部，亦于是日进犯牛市屯西十五里之王堡村，伪军王玉珠部占我牛市屯东南二十里之牛馆相寺。国民党长垣地方部队何冠三部三千余人，携带民夫百余人，刻正在以上侵占地区赶修工事，准备再犯。\n    【新华社南宫二十日电】盘踞长清齐河一带之伪军袁逆砚秋、韩逆茂才、庞逆长申、杨逆静斋等部，停战令后向解放区进犯共一百四十六次，使用兵力两万七千五百七十人，打死我区村干部及群众等七十余名，捕走一百廿七人，残害村庄二百四十余。\n    【本报邯郸二十一日讯】被国民党郑州绥靖公署参谋长赵子立与开封第六绥靖区主任刘汝明百般阻难的新乡中心执行小组之豫东小组，自十一日到十八日往返于郑州开封间。国方代表奉命突于十八日向豫东小组之美方与中共代表表示：“若一定赴豫东勘察，国军不能保障小组安全”。该组受此威胁后，被迫已于十九日返回新乡。于此，可见国民党军企图扩大内战，向我豫东解放区进攻之决心。"

    "content": "【This Newspaper, Heze News】 Ningyang was a \"model county\" under long-term enemy-puppet control, where the Baojia system was fully implemented. The masses bore seventy-odd kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies on chickens, dogs, geese, ducks, weddings, and so on, amounting to no less than 200 jin per mu per year. In addition, there were labor burdens such as digging ditches, building walls, standing guard, transporting coal, and guarding railways every day. Coupled with drought and locust plagues, there were consecutive years of poor harvests, corruption by Bao chiefs, and taking advantage of the chaos, resulting in four \"many\" in Ningyang: (1) Many people seeking work as hired laborers. (More than 4,000 people went to Tai'an alone to seek work). (2) Many people fleeing famine. (3) Many people begging for food. (4) Many traitors. The darkness and chaos were like a living hell. Based on this situation, the county committee decided to first suppress the evil atmosphere and then deepen the movement. First, the enemy's set of Baojia system and exorbitant taxes were abolished. Through anti-traitor accusations and grievance telling, the traitorous ruling apparatus was crushed, and then the movement turned to rent reduction. After the masses understood our policies and propositions, they spontaneously launched a struggle against puppet Bao chiefs. That night, fifty or sixty people went to settle accounts with the Bao chiefs. As the evil atmosphere began to be suppressed and the peasants' morale rose, the leadership seized the moment, struck while the iron was hot, and guided the transition to rent reduction. It was explained to tenants and hired laborers that we were the vanguards of the poor and must first turn over; it was explained to poor and middle peasants that after the victory against traitors, we would help tenants reduce rent and increase wages. The rent reduction struggle against \"Master Huang\" was organized first, and then expanded to a joint struggle of dozens of villages. \"Master Huang\" had served as a governor-general, owned more than 200 qing of large mu (equivalent to 600 city qing), and employed more than 200 male and female servants. Some people compared his prestige to that of the Jia family in \"Dream of the Red Chamber.\" He was the most ruthless in exploiting his tenants. His rent was a \"living rent,\" requiring the original rent in bad years and increasing it in good years. If the tenant was unwilling to pay, the land would be taken back immediately. When collecting rent in the village, he would arbitrarily beat, scold, and humiliate the tenants. Xiaohengzhuang was the village of \"Master Huang,\" and the entire village was made up of tenants. These tenants had been farming for four generations, but they were becoming poorer and poorer. In the first generation, all the tenants in the village still had more than 50 mu of land, but now they only had 28 mu. Young men, only two had married wives. The common saying among the men and women, old and young, in this village was: \"If we farm for another lifetime, even the roots will be broken.\" After Xiaohengzhuang was overturned, the tenants set off separately to contact villages outside. In half a month, the rent reduction struggle against Huang's family was victorious in more than a dozen villages! After the victory, more than 800 tenants and hired laborers jointly held a grand meeting to celebrate the victory, overturning more than 300,000 jin of grain. Currently, vigorous rent reduction and wage increase and land return struggles are underway in various districts.\n\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n宁阳    Ningyang\n荷泽    Heze\n保甲制度  Baojia system\n泰安    Tai'an\n黄大人  Huang Daren\n小恒庄  Xiaohengzhuang\n贾府    Jia fu\n红楼梦  Hong Lou Meng\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 掌握运动火候  宁阳反奸减租紧密结合\n\n1946-05-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　掌握运动火候\n    宁阳反奸减租紧密结合\n    【本报荷泽讯】宁阳是敌伪长期统制的“模范县”，全都实行了保甲制度，鸡、狗、鹅、鸭、嫁娶等等七十余苛捐杂税，群众负担每年每亩不下二百斤，另外还有天天挖沟打墙、站岗、运炭、看铁路等劳役负担，又加旱灾蝗虫，连年不收，保长贪污，混水摸鱼，造成了宁阳四多：（一）找活的雇工多。（光到泰安找活做的就有四千多）。（二）逃荒的多。（三）要饭的多。（四）汉奸多。黑暗混乱象人间地狱。县委根据这种情况，决定先把邪气压下去，再使运动深入。首先取消敌人的一套保甲制度，苛捐杂税，通过反奸诉苦，打垮了汉奸统治机构，紧接着转入减租运动。群众认识了我们的政策和主张后，自发的开展了反伪保长的斗争，当夜就有五六十人去找保长算账。邪气开始压下去，农民情绪高涨起来，领导上就抓紧了火候，趁热打铁，引导转入减租，对佃雇说明咱们是穷人的先锋队，要先翻身；对贫中农说明反奸胜利后咱们要帮助雇佃减租增资。首先组织了对“黄大人”的减租斗争，一直扩大到几十个村的联合斗争。“黄大人”曾坐过总督，有二百多顷大亩地（合市顷六百顷），用过男女仆人二百多个，有人比他的威风和红楼梦上的贾府差不多，他对佃户的剥削最厉害，他的租是活租，坏年景原租要，好年景就提高，如佃户不愿交，立即退地。到村里催租时，任意打骂侮辱佃户，小恒庄就是“黄大人”的庄，全庄都当佃户。这些佃户种了四辈子地了，越种越少，头一辈子时全村佃户还有五十多亩地，现在只落二十八亩了。年轻小伙子，只有两个娶媳妇的。这村男女老少的口头语：“再种一辈子地连根都种断了。”小恒庄倒租后，佃户分头出发联络外村，半月的工夫十多个村庄对黄大人的减租斗争胜利了！胜利后八百多雇佃联合开大会庆祝胜利，共倒粮食三十余万斤。目前各区正进行热烈的减租增资和回地斗争。"

He is deeply concerned about the serious situation in North China and is now trying his best to prevent the war in the Northeast from spreading to North China. The current propaganda campaign by both sides will inevitably stir up emotions and make it more likely that some impatient people will start a prairie fire. This reckless propaganda of hatred and suspicion exacerbates the current serious situation and could lead to unbearable consequences for the Chinese people. The work of the executive groups is made difficult by the increased propaganda among officers and soldiers on both sides. The effort to localize the conflict, if not completely stop it, in China depends largely on the success of these executive groups. The American representatives in each group are coping with a situation that is not only difficult but also life-threatening, with firm and impartial efforts to improve the current situation.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd] People here expressed sympathy for the desire in Marshall's headquarters' 20th statement to stop the civil war in the Northeast and clarify the situation in North China. Marshall's warning that some warmongers are attempting to plunge all of China into a prairie fire and cause unbearable consequences for the Chinese people has particularly resonated with the Yan'an community. Yan'an public opinion has repeatedly called on Chinese and foreign personnel to take steps to prevent this situation.

The article stated: \"Many Japanese soldiers still remain in China. These Japanese soldiers seem to get along very well with the Chinese, and if the government feels that there is no other assistance in its struggle with the Communists, it may be strongly tempted to use them.\"\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st] Beiping News: Chen Jinkun, a famous professor in Ping City, recently wrote an article opposing the US military's aid to the Kuomintang authorities in waging civil war, saying: \"After Japan's surrender, the United States did provide the Kuomintang with a large amount of military supplies, allowing the Kuomintang to prevent the Communist Party from accepting the surrender. Recently, it has lent warships to help train soldiers and further lent funds. This is enough to encourage the Kuomintang to fight a civil war with madness (that is, madness), and the troops heading to the Northeast are clearly transported by American warships. This really requires the United States to pay attention.\" Chen believes that the Kuomintang authorities' violation of the ceasefire agreement and the military reorganization plan is not just the Kuomintang authorities' barbarism and unreasonableness, lawlessness; but also shows that the United States has lost credibility in front of all the Chinese people and the people of the world.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国\tChina\n马歇尔  Mashal\n延安\tYan'an\n新华社\tXinhua News Agency\n中央社\tCentral News Agency\n南京\tNanjing\n东北\tNortheast\n华北\tNorth China\n中共\tZhonggong (Chinese Communist Party)\n路透社\tReuters\n伦敦\tLondon\n伦敦星期日观察报  London Sunday Observer\n法西斯派\tfascists\n日寇\tJapanese bandits\n北平\tBeiping\n陈瑾昆  Chen Jinkun\n平市\tPing City\n国民党\tKuomintang\n美国\tAmerica / United States\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 毋使中国陷于烽火燎原  马歇尔警告好战分子  延安方面咸表同情愿与美方公正人士亲密合作维护和平\n\n1946-05-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　毋使中国陷于烽火燎原\n    马歇尔警告好战分子\n    延安方面咸表同情愿与美方公正人士亲密合作维护和平\n    【新华社延安二十二日电】中央社南京二十日电：此间马歇尔总部今发表声明，全文如下：马歇尔将军每日就恢复东北和平事，与中国各党代表及其他方面举行商谈，彼对于华北之严重局势深为关切，现正尽力设法使东北战事不致延及华北。目前双方所进行之宣传运动，自必激动情绪，并有愈使若干急燥者酿成烽火燎原之可能。此项仇恨与猜忌之轻率宣传，使目前之严重局势益形加剧，并能导使中国人民遭受不堪之后果。执行小组之工作因双方在官兵间加强宣传，而至感困难，中国纵非完全制止冲突，而至少使其冲突局部化之努力则多半有赖于此等执行小组之成功，各小组中之美方代表，正以坚定而公正之努力，应付不仅包括艰难而且甘冒生命危险之局势，以谋改善现状。\n    【新华社延安二十二日电】此间人士表示同情马歇尔总部二十日声明中，关于制止东北内战与澄清华北局势的愿望。马歇尔警告若干好战分子，企图使全中国陷于烽火燎原，并使中国人民遭受不堪之后果一节，特别引起延安社会的共鸣。延安舆论曾多次呼吁中外人士采取步骤，以阻止此种情势。此间权威方面保证，中共将与保持坚定而公正态度以谋制止冲突的美国人员继续密切合作，以维护全中国的和平，使其免于被好战分子所破坏。\n    【新华社延安二十二日电】路透社伦敦讯：伦敦星期日观察报，二十一日著文泄露中国法西斯派勾结与利用日寇进行内战的大阴谋。该文称：“许多日军，迄今仍留在中国，这些日军似与中国相处甚得，如果政府感觉在其与共产党斗争中别无其他援助时，则很可能受到强烈的诱惑来使用它们”。\n    【新华社延安二十一日电】北平讯：平市名教授陈瑾昆，顷为文反对美军援助国民党当局进行内战称：“美国在日本投降后，确曾供给国民党大批军火，使国民党阻止共产党受降，最近则又借给军舰，帮着练兵，进而借给款项，这已足以鼓励国民党打内战的狂兴（就是狂病），而开往东北的军队又明明是美国军舰运送的，这的确要请美国注意”。陈氏认为国民党当局破坏停战协定与整军方案，不只是国民党当局的蛮横无理，无法无天；而且说明美国在全中国人民与全世界人民面前减失了信用。"

    "content": "US Sabotages Moscow Resolution\n    US-Soviet Joint Commission on Korea Fails\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] Moscow dispatch: The News reports details of the US-Soviet Joint Commission on Korea being forced to cease work, accusing the US side of sabotaging the Moscow Resolution. The US-Soviet Joint Commission on Korea held its first meeting in Seoul on March 20, mainly to organize a provisional Korean democratic government as quickly as possible, in accordance with the decision on Korea of the Three Foreign Ministers' Moscow Conference. On this issue, the commission should consult with various Korean democratic parties and social organizations. However, at the first meeting, the US and Soviet representatives argued over the conditions for the participation of Korean democratic parties and social organizations in the consultation, as well as the extent of the provisional government's composition. On the first issue, the Soviet representative proposed that the basic condition for the participation of democratic parties and social organizations in the consultation was that they recognize and support the Moscow Resolution. The US representative, on the other hand, insisted that the joint commission establish a separate \"Consultative Alliance,\" based on the auxiliary organs of US Commander Hodge in South Korea (formed by representatives of reactionary parties), and supplemented by representatives of several democratic parties from North Korea. The joint commission would then consult with this reactionary alliance and entrust it with submitting a list of the provisional Korean democratic government and the provisional constitution of that government. The Soviet representative opposed this proposal, arguing that the establishment of a \"Consultative Alliance\" violated the Moscow Resolution and that the joint commission should maintain direct contact with various Korean democratic parties and social organizations. After lengthy discussions, in order to accelerate the formation of a provisional Korean democratic government, the Soviet side made many concessions to the US side. On April 5, the Soviet side suggested that those parties and social organizations that opposed the Moscow Resolution should be allowed to participate in the consultation, provided they admitted their mistakes and announced their support for the Moscow Resolution, but that non-democratic elements should not be allowed to participate in the provisional government. The US and Soviet representatives concluded their negotiations and issued Communiqué No. 5 on April 19, stipulating that the joint commission should consult with those truly democratic parties and social organizations that had issued declarations in support of the Moscow Conference's decision on Korea. After the communiqué was issued, the commission began drafting the charter of the major democratic parties and social organizations participating in the consultation, reaching the following agreement: the list for North Korea would be submitted by the Soviet command, and the list for South Korea would be submitted by the US side. However, of the twenty parties and social organizations submitted by the US side, only three belonged to the National Democratic Front, and the rest belonged to the so-called \"Democratic Council.\" These people were notorious for opposing the Moscow Resolution, and at the same time, they refused to correct their mistakes as stipulated in Communiqué No. 5 and were unwilling to express their support for the Moscow Resolution. Lieutenant General Hodge came out to explain for them, distorting the four powers' five-year trusteeship of Korea in the Moscow Resolution. He also explained that the declaration required to sign Communiqué No. 5 did not equal agreeing with or supporting the trusteeship system. The \"Democratic Council\" obtained guarantees from Hodge's statement and allowed its parties and social organizations to sign a declaration in support of the Moscow Resolution on May 1. However, at the same time, it issued a statement: \"Signing the declaration does not mean cooperating with the joint commission. After the formation of the provisional government, we will come out against the trusteeship system.\" This statement clearly contained a major conspiracy, so after the statement was issued, the Soviet Union naturally refused the \"Democratic Council's\" parties and social organizations the right to participate in the consultation.\n    On the second issue, the US side suggested that government agencies and the Central Economic Organ for unifying the Korean economy should be organized by the joint commission itself, and insisted that they should be established before the provisional government was formed. The Soviet side rejected this plan, arguing that these two institutions should only be implemented after the provisional democratic government was formed.\n    After the negotiations on the first issue ended, the US side attempted to delay the establishment of a provisional government in Korea, proposing to first discuss the issue of unifying the Korean economy and eliminating the North-South border. The Soviet representative also sternly rejected this. The US delegation then suggested that the joint commission cease its work, and the Soviet delegation was forced to agree.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n中国    Zhōngguó (China)\n苏联    Sūlián (Soviet Union)\n美国    Měiguó (United States)\n朝鲜    Cháoxiǎn (Korea)\n延安    Yán'ān\n莫斯科  Mòsīkē (Moscow)\n汉城    Hànchéng (Seoul)\n霍奇    Huòqí (Hodge)\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n消息报  News\n全国民主阵线 Quánguó Mínzhǔ Zhènxiàn (National Democratic Front)\n民主委员部  Mínzhǔ Wěiyuánhuì Bù (Democratic Council)\n三外长莫斯科会议    Sān Wàizhǎng Mòsīkē Huìyì (Three Foreign Ministers' Moscow Conference)\n美苏共同委员会  Měisū Gòngtóng Wěiyuánhuì (US-Soviet Joint Commission)\n莫斯科决议  Mòsīkē Juéyì (Moscow Resolution)\n朝鲜临时民主政府 Cháoxiǎn Línshí Mínzhǔ Zhèngfǔ (Provisional Korean Democratic Government)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美方破坏莫斯科决议  朝鲜美苏委会流产\n\n1946-05-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美方破坏莫斯科决议\n    朝鲜美苏委会流产\n    【新华社延安二十日电】莫斯科讯：消息报登载朝鲜苏美共同委员会被迫停止工作的详情，指责美方破坏莫斯科决议。苏美共同委员会三月二十日在汉城开首次会议，主要是根据三外长莫斯科会议朝鲜决定，尽速组织一临时朝鲜民主政府。在此问题上，该委员会应与朝鲜各民主政党及社会组织咨商，但在首次会议上，苏美代表在朝鲜各民主政党与社会组织参加咨商的条件上，以及临时政府组成的程度上，发生了争执。在第一个问题，苏联代表提出民主政党社会组织参加咨商的基本条件，是它们承认与支持莫斯科决定；美代表则主张共同委员会另外建立一个“咨询联盟”，以朝鲜南部美司令霍奇中将的辅助机关（为反动党派代表所结成）为基础，再补充几名朝鲜北部的民主政党的代表组成之。而共同委员会即与此反动联盟咨商，并委托它提出朝鲜临时民主政府的名单，以及该政府的临时宪法。苏联代表反对此一建议，认为建立“咨询联盟”是违反莫斯科决定，是共同委员会与朝鲜各民主政党与社会组织保持直接联系。经过长时讨论后，苏方为了加速组成朝鲜临时民主政府，便对美方作了很多让步，苏方于四月五日建议那些反对莫斯科决定的各政党及社会组织，只要承认他们的错误，并宣布支持莫斯科决定，即准许他们参加咨商，但绝不允许非民主分子参加临时政府。苏美代表谈判结束，便于四月十九日发表第五号公报，规定共同委员会应与那些真正民主的，并发表宣言拥护莫斯科会议朝鲜决定的各民主政党与社会组织进行商讨。公报发表后，委员会即着手起草参加咨商的各主要民主政党与社会组织的章程，达到如下协议：朝鲜北部名单由苏指挥部提出，南部由美方提出。但美方提出的二十个政党与社会组织的名单中，属于全国民主阵线的只有三个，其余则属于所谓“民主委员部”。这些人反对莫斯科决定而臭名昭著，同时他们拒绝第五号公报中的规定改正他们的错误，并不愿表明支持莫斯科决定的态度。霍奇中将便出来为他们解释，曲解朝鲜决定中四强对朝鲜实行五年托管。并解释签署第五号公报所需要的声明，并不就等于赞成或支持托管制。“民主委员部”自霍奇声明中获得了保障，便于五月一日准许其政党与社会组织签署拥护莫斯科决定的宣言。但同时又发表声明：“签署宣言并不意味着与共同委员会合作，于组成临时政府之后，我们即出而反对托管制”。这项声明显然包括很大阴谋在内，因此该声明发表后，苏联当然就拒绝“民主委员部”各政党与社会组织参加咨商的权利。\n    在第二个问题上，美方建议政府机构及统一朝鲜经济的中央经济机关，由共同委员会本身来组织，并主张临时政府组成以前，即应建立起来；苏方拒绝这一计划，认为这二个机构均应在临时民主政府组成后才能实行。\n    在第一个问题上，双方终止谈判后，美方企图延迟朝鲜临时政府的建立，提出先讨论统一朝鲜经济问题与消除南北边界问题，苏代表亦予以严正拒绝。美代表团随即建议共同委员会停止其工作，苏代表团被迫同意。"

The subcommittee stated that it had sent invitations to Spanish Republican Prime Minister Giral (who is currently in Mexico attending related meetings). The Soviet letters included materials on Franco's military cooperation with the Axis powers during the war and the activities of the Blue Division. The Belgian government's letter pointed out that Franco was hiding Belgian war criminal Degrelle, who, after being sentenced to death by the Belgian government, fled into Spain in German military uniform in May 1945. The British note regarding the situation in Spain was not published due to being marked \"confidential.\" Giral's memorandum provided evidence supporting Poland's accusation that continuing to maintain diplomatic relations with Franco outwardly constitutes recognition of the Axis powers' interference in Spain's internal affairs as legitimate, while severing relations with him would not constitute interference in Spain's internal affairs, nor would it be an infringement on Spanish sovereignty. Giral's documents revealed that Franco's armed forces had increased from 100,000 in 1936 to the current 840,000, with 250,000 stationed along the French border. It also stated that Franco possessed the technical capability and raw materials to manufacture atomic bombs. The new president of the Security Council, French representative Chauvel, declared that France believes Franco is indeed a factor threatening peace, and France is very concerned about the deployment of Franco's troops along the border. Furthermore, a dispatch reported that the United States' material on Franco, totaling 62 pages, was also submitted to the subcommittee on the 18th.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] New York dispatch: The term of Egyptian representative Afifi as President of the Security Council has expired (Note: The presidency of the Security Council rotates monthly according to the alphabetical order of the names of the countries), and the new president, French representative Chauvel, succeeded him on the 17th.

Special agent Sun Qi@ and others opened fire in pursuit. Because some students were still surrounded in the school, the pursued students turned back and called for their release. At this time, students from the main campus also came to inquire. The special agents then tightly closed the school gate, firing shots and throwing bricks and stones indiscriminately. On the 24th, the Chenggu military police, in coordination with the university, announced martial law throughout the city. Led by the special agents, military police went to student dormitories and public places to carry out mass arrests.

    "content": "Talking About the Past and Present of Commerce in Handan\n\n　　Open up a map of Hebei Province, and you'll find that Handan is a place with convenient transportation, a relatively moderate position in our border region, and abundant products. The Pinghan Railway stretches north and south from its side. The Handan-Changzhi Railway reaches Shangdang to the west. The Fuyang River converges with the Ziya River and flows directly to Tianjin, and before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were as many as two thousand ships carrying dozens of tons of cargo. The cotton production of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area accounts for about one-half of the total cotton production in North China, and Handan is located on the transportation hub of this cotton-producing area. To the west, coal, iron, mountain goods, medicinal materials, hemp, porcelain... from the Taihang Mountains are mostly exported from Handan. In any aspect, Handan has excellent conditions to become a modern industrial and commercial city.\n\n　　However, before October 4, 1945, Handan was suffocated and strangled.\n\n　　It is said that around the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), Handan had gradually \"prospered\". But behind the so-called \"prosperity\" at that time, there were countless farmers' suffering and an increasingly deepening crisis. At that time, the largest trades were cotton, grain, mountain goods, groceries, and cloth. A large amount of cotton and mountain goods were transported to Tianjin and Beijing via the Pinghan Railway. Cotton fields increased, grain fields decreased, and grain merchants transported grain from Henan and Hubei to Handan, some of which was sold in nearby counties, and some was transported to Tianjin and Beijing. At its peak, it processed 100,000 shi of various grains every day. On the other hand, foreign cloths and groceries also poured in in large quantities. The most warehouses numbered more than sixty, and foreign merchants often stationed two or three thousand people. Merchants called this period the \"Golden Age\". They did make a lot of money in reselling, but they did not have solid funds. They acted as intermediaries for unequal exchange for foreign merchants. Therefore, the Handan market at that time was very lively on the surface, but very empty in its bones, and extremely speculative. The broad masses of farmers became increasingly impoverished in this unequal transaction.\n\n　　When the Japanese imperialist invaders invaded Handan in 1937, they immediately and cruelly and thoroughly \"transformed\" this semi-colonial \"free trade.\" Everything was ruled. Handan changed again.\n\n　　On the surface, Handan was even more \"prosperous.\" The number of businesses increased from 329 before the war to 1,652 in August 1945. Under the \"Greater Handan\" construction plan, large roads appeared in Southwest Village, and electric lights were installed.\n\n　　Why did the enemy actively \"build\" Handan? We won't talk about the military and political \"significance\" here. The economic conspiracy alone is enough to be alarming. If we analyze the commercial situation during the enemy-puppet period, cotton firms, grain firms, warehouses, fur goods, etc. account for 516 of these 1,653 businesses. Regardless of the subjective wishes of these businesses, the enemy used them to absorb large quantities of valuable materials such as cotton, oil, and waste metal materials. Moreover, through them, they dumped various luxury Japanese goods. According to rough estimates, the enemy absorbed 10 million jin of cotton from Handan every year, and cotton seeds from September to March and April of the following year, averaging 200,000 jin per day. The flour company came forward with about 10 million jin per year, most of which was absorbed except for a portion reserved for local enemy-puppet military use. (As for scrap metal, it was plundered by way of dedication, and the amount was also astonishing.) The so-called absorption here is just a euphemism for looting. For example, before the War of Resistance Against Japan, southern Hebei was rich in native cloth, which was sold in Shanxi and made great profits. The weaving income of rural women accounted for a considerable proportion of farmers' total income. The enemy burned farmers' weaving tools, ordered farmers to grow cotton, and sold it at prices below cost. Of course, the farmers were overwhelmed by this, and the merchants, except those related to the enemy and designated by the enemy to absorb cotton, were also idle and unprofitable. Grain firms, which used to account for a large proportion of Handan's trade, still had 87 firms, but except for a very few who had a relationship with the enemy and directly or indirectly absorbed grain for the enemy, the majority of grain merchants had to reduce their business due to heavy donations and taxes, heavy restrictions on freight transportation, and the danger of being confiscated for being accused of \"hoarding and hoarding.\" Grain firms that used to store tens of thousands of bags of grain were changed to retail grain stalls, relying only on the \"dou yong\" nature of profits to make a living. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, coal yards were also an important trade in Handan. Dozens of coal yards of various sizes were located in the suburbs of Handan and the villages along the Fuyang River, transporting coal from Wu'an, Jiaozuo and other places, and relying on the Fuyang River water transport to the interior of southern Hebei. About 100,000 people directly and indirectly relied on Fuyang shipping for a living. At this time, the enemy robbed all the coal, and the people were deprived of the right to burn coal. By August 1945, only two coal yards were left in Handan.\n\n　　However, some commercial sectors became unprecedentedly \"prosperous.\" There were a total of 491 foreign and Guangdong grocery stores, restaurants, brothels, and opium dens. The development of this kind of commerce, which promoted cheap luxury goods of the enemy and supplied the extravagant life of the enemy-puppet regime, only showed that Handan was becoming more colonialized. Of course, the population of Handan City had increased significantly after the War of Resistance Against Japan compared with before the war. Some of these increased populations were merchants (whose business was detrimental to the country and the people as mentioned above), and the vast majority were puppet officials who came here to live off of the parasites, and the poor people who were squeezed by the enemy-puppet regime in the countryside and came here to make a living.\n\n　　It must be admitted that the number of businesses in Handan was greatly reduced after the initial liberation, and some commercial sectors were \"depressed.\" There are many reasons for this, such as some illegal merchants who had relations with the enemy ran away; some merchants did not fully understand the trade policies of the democratic government; and the Nationalist reactionaries launched a civil war and blockaded traffic, making freight transportation difficult, etc. But to analyze it from the essence, this \"depression\" is not surprising. On the contrary, the reduction of some businesses that trafficked in foreign luxury goods and absorbed materials for the enemy is beneficial to the people and the country. The colonial economic nature changed with the liberation of Handan.\n\n　　Due to the promotion and support of the democratic government, Handan's commerce has rapidly recovered and increased. As of the end of April this year, the number of established businesses has increased to 1,019, and the number of peddlers has developed more rapidly than before. Comparing today's businesses with those during the enemy-puppet rule will lead to a gratifying conclusion.\n\n　　During the enemy-puppet rule, there were a total of 25 brothels and opium dens. Now, opium dens have long disappeared, and the vast majority of prostitutes have changed careers to engage in production. This is a healthy phenomenon and is unprecedented in all of China. The number of cloth stores selling foreign cloth has decreased from 130 in the past to the current 21, but at the same time, a large number of native cloth stores and native cloth peddlers have increased. Eliminating leakage and using domestic goods are our goals today. The ideals of many progressive economists have been realized in today's Handan. The number of cotton firms was 186 in the past, but now it is 11. The cotton firms in the past were to absorb cotton for the enemy, and the cotton firms today are aimed at regulating the surplus and deficiency of the liberated areas. This year, southern Hebei has planted a very wide area of cotton, and it is estimated that the number of cotton firms will increase significantly this autumn. It will become a good business that benefits both people and themselves.\n\n　　Many other industries have also increased. The number of coal yards has increased from two during the enemy-puppet period to the current 20. Coal from the Taihang Mountains is continuously transported eastward, and the pain of having no coal to burn in southern Hebei has become a thing of the past. 88 new cigarette industries have emerged. Cigarettes are a huge consumption. The materials in the liberated areas plus the labor in the liberated areas have stopped so many leakages. The number of silver shops has increased from five in the past to the current seven. The privately-owned Ruihua Bank is about to open. If the financial industry is a barometer of a market, then the Handan market in the future will definitely become active with the development of the financial industry.\n\n　　The democratic government has spared no effort in the restoration of Handan's industry and commerce. 1.7 million yuan of poverty alleviation loans saved more than 4,000 people. The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Bank not only gave them loans without interest or at low interest, but also helped them settle down according to their different living conditions. General industrial and commercial loans have reached 16 million yuan within half a year. Many businesses have received help from the bank, some of which have immediately resumed business, and some of which are expanding their operations. In the past, the enemy-puppet regime officially collected 24 kinds of taxes. Now, the government only plans to collect business income tax and tobacco and alcohol tax. The problem of supporting the army, which was the most headache for merchants, has been greatly reduced. Compared with today and the past, it is simply incomparable. The highways and roads have been restored and expanded, and east-west trade is unprecedentedly smooth. The economies of the mountainous and plain areas are integrated, which is a good time for merchants to make a fortune. The government is afraid that merchants will not make money. It not only supports commerce from the outside, but also tries to regulate shopkeeper disputes from the inside, appropriately improve the treatment of shop assistants, and improve their work enthusiasm and sense of responsibility, which is also beneficial to shop owners. Under the promotion and support of the democratic government, we will soon see a new and prosperous Handan City. The merchants here will be the happiest.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国\tChina\n河北省\tHebei Sheng (Hebei Province)\n邯郸\tHandan\n平汉路\tPinghan Lu (Pinghan Railway)\n邯长路\tHandan-Changzhi Railway\n上党\tShangdang\n滏阳河\tFuyang He (Fuyang River)\n子牙河\tZiya He (Ziya River)\n天津\tTianjin\n晋冀鲁豫区\tJin-Ji-Lu-Yu Qu (Jin-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Area)\n华北\tHuabei (North China)\n太行山\tTaihang Shan (Taihang Mountains)\n武安\tWu'an\n焦作\tJiaozuo\n冀南\tJi Nan (Southern Hebei)\n瑞华银行\tRuihua Bank\n西南庄\tXinan Zhuang (Southwest Village)\n山西\tShanxi\n国民党\tGuomindang (Nationalist Party)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 邯郸商业今昔谈\n李庄\n1946-05-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　邯郸商业今昔谈\n    翻开河北省的地图，你会发现邯郸是个交通便利、在我边区地位较适中与物产丰饶的好地方。平汉路从它身旁向南北伸展开去。邯长路西达上党。滏阳河汇子牙河直达天津，载重几十吨的船只在抗战前曾有两千艘。晋冀鲁豫区的棉产约为华北棉产总数的二分之一，邯郸正在这个棉产区的交通要冲上。在西边，太行山的煤、铁、山货、药材、麻、瓷器……也多从邯郸出口。无论从那方面说，邯郸都有成为一个现代工商业都市的优良条件。\n    但是，在三十四年十月四日以前，邯郸是被窒息与绞杀着的。\n    据说在民国二十年左右，邯郸就已逐渐“繁荣”起来。但在当时之所谓“繁荣”的背后，却隐藏着无数农民的痛苦与日益加深的危机。那时候最大的贸易是棉花、粮食、山货、杂货、布匹。大批棉花、山货由平汉路运往平津。棉田增殖、粮田减少，粮商从河南、湖北把粮食运到邯郸，有的销行附近各县，有的运往平津。最高时每日吞吐各种粮食十万石。在另一方面，外来的洋布、杂货也大批侵进来。货栈最多时曾达六十多家，外来客商常驻者两三千人。商人们称这个时期为“黄金时代”。他们的确在转手之间赚了大钱，但是他们并没有殷实的资金，他们是替外商充当不等价交换的中介；所以那时的邯郸市场表面上非常活泼，骨子里却很空虚，投机性极大。而广大农民却在这种不等价交易中越来越贫困了。\n    日本帝国侵略者在二十六年侵入邯郸，立刻就把这种半殖民地性的“自由贸易”残酷而彻底的“改造”了。一切都统治起来。邯郸又换了一番新面貌。\n    从表面上看，邯郸是更加“繁荣”了。商号从事变前的三百二十九家增至三十四年八月的一千六百五十二家。在“大邯郸”的建设计划之下，西南庄出现了大马路，设置了电灯。\n    敌人为什么这样积极的“建设”邯郸？军事、政治的“意义”这里不去说它。单是经济的阴谋已经够使人吃惊了。如果把敌伪在时的商业情况分析一下，在这一千六百五十三家商号中，棉花行、粮食行、货栈、皮货等共占五百一十六家，不管这些商号的主观意愿如何，敌人却是通过他们把大批的宝贵物资如棉花、油料、五金废料等吸收去了。而且也通过他们，倾销各种奢侈性的日货。据粗略的估计，敌人每年从邯郸吸收的棉花达一千万斤，棉籽从九月到翌年三、四月，每天平均吸收二十万斤，面粉公司每年出面约一千万斤，除一部分留为当地敌伪军用外，大部分也被吸收走了。（至于五金废料，则是以献纳方式掠夺而去，数目也很惊人）这里所谓吸收，只是一个抢掠的代名词。例如抗战前冀南盛产土布，行销山西，获利极大。农妇的纺织收入在农民的整个收入中占了相当大的比重。敌人烧毁农民的纺织工具，勒令农民种棉，并以低于成本的价钱卖给它。农民们当然因此被压得喘不过气来，就是商人们除了与敌人有关，被敌人指定代为吸收棉花的“指定商”以外，广大的正当商人也都无事可作无利可图了。过去占邯郸贸易大宗的粮行虽然还有八十七家，其中除了极少数与敌人有关系、直接间接替敌人吸收粮食者外，广大粮商则因为捐税苛重，货运遭受重重限制，并常常被指为“囤集居奇”而遭没收的危险，故不得不缩小营业。往日存粮几万包的粮行改为零买零售的粮摊，只靠着“斗佣”性质的利润糊口。抗战前煤栈也是邯郸重要贸易之一，邯郸城郊及沿滏阳河畔的村镇曾有大小规模的煤栈数十家，从武安、焦作等地运来煤炭，靠着滏阳河水运入冀南内地。直接间接依靠滏阳船运为生的约有十万人。这时候敌人把煤炭都抢夺走了，老百姓被剥夺了烧煤的权利，到三十四年八月，全邯郸的煤栈只剩了两家。\n    但是，也有一部分商业空前的“繁荣”起来。洋广杂货、饭馆、妓院、土膏店等总数有四百九十一家。这种推销敌人廉价的奢侈品和供给敌伪奢糜生活的商业的发展，只能说明邯郸的更加殖民地化。当然，邯郸市的人口在抗战后比抗战前曾有大量的增加，这些增加的人口中有一部分是商人（其营业的不利于国家、人民已如上述），绝大部分还是到这里寄生的伪属，和在乡下被敌伪压榨不能生活而到这里谋生的贫民。\n    不必讳言，邯郸的商号在初解放后曾经一度大为减少，某些商业是“萧条”了。这里面的原因很多，如一部分与敌人有关系的非法商人跑了；某些商人对民主政府的贸易政策还不够了解；由于国民党反动派发动内战、封锁交通而使货运不畅等。但要从本质上加以分析，这种“萧条”并不足奇，相反的某些贩运外来的奢侈品和替敌人吸收物资的商号减少，对人民、对国家倒是有好处的。殖民地的经济性质随着邯郸的解放而改变了。\n    由于民主政府的提倡和扶植，邯郸的商业迅速的恢复和增加。截至今年四月底，坐商已增至一千零一十九户，摊贩比较以前更有飞跃的发展。把今天的商号与敌伪统治时的商号作一比较，将会得出一个可喜的结论。\n    敌伪统治时妓院和土膏店共有二十五家。现在土膏店早经绝迹，绝大多数的妓女都转业从事生产了。这是一种健康的现象，在全中国都是空前的。贩运洋布的布行由过去的一百三十家减至现在的二十一家，但同时却增加了大量的土布店和土布摊贩。杜绝漏扈、服用国货正是我们今天的奋斗目标。许多进步经济学者的理想在今日的邯郸实现了。棉花行过去一百八十六家，现在是十一家。过去的棉行是为敌人吸收棉花，今天的棉行旨在调剂解放区的有无。今年冀南棉植极广，估计今秋棉行会有大量增加。它会成为一种利人利己的好生意。\n    还有许多行业增加了。煤栈由敌伪在时的两家增至现在的二十家。太行山的煤炭源源东运，冀南区无煤烧的痛苦已经成了过去的事情。卷烟业新生了八十八家，纸烟为一巨大消耗，解放区的材料加上解放区的人工，不知杜绝了多少漏扈，银号由过去的五家增至现在的七家，私营瑞华银行已将开业。如果说金融业是一个市场的寒暑表，那么今后的邯郸市场，一定会随金融业的发展而活跃起来。\n    民主政府对于邯郸工商业的恢复可谓不遗余力。一百七十万元的贫民贷款救活了四千多人。冀南银行不只无利或低利给他们贷款，而且根据各自不同的生活条件，帮助他们安家。一般工商业贷款，半年内已达一千六百万元。许多商号得到银行的帮助，有的立即复业，有的正在扩大经营。过去敌伪正式征收的各种税款有二十四种，现在政府只准备征收营业所得税和烟酒税。为商人所最头痛的支差问题大为减少，以今日和过去比较，简直是不可同日而语的，公路大道恢复展修，东西贸易空前通畅，山地平原的经济融为一体，正是商人发财的好时候，政府唯恐商人不赚钱，它不但从外部扶植商业，而且从内部设法调节店东纠纷，适当改善店员待遇，提高他们的工作积极性与责任心，这对店主同样是有利的。在民主政府的提倡与扶植下，我们不久就会看到一个崭新而繁荣的邯郸市。这里的商人将是最幸福的。"

On the 15th, Yan's stubborn forces advanced from Taiyuan and Yuci in three routes toward the wheat-producing areas of central Shanxi. One route of more than 400 people surrounded Nanzhuang, the location of my Yuci County government, and captured nine of our cadres, declaring everywhere: \"As long as we have wheat, we will be able to eliminate the Communist bandits.\" They then occupied Beixi Village. Another route of 800 people occupied Beige Village. The third route surrounded Zhangzhuang and then occupied Yongkang Village. The 13th Regiment, transferred from the Baijin Line to the Zhengtai Line under the order of Yan Xishan, has advanced to Pindg and is now prepared to seize wheat. The troops concentrated around Yuci are called the \"mobile force\" snatched from the central Shanxi area by Yan Xishan. On the Tongpu Line, Yan's army stationed in Libao, east of Hongdong, under the slogan of \"protecting the wheat harvest,\" has been arresting and killing young people in Dongs, Zhoubi, and Fengbao around the liberated area for days. A popular folk song in the border area goes: \"We've waited hard for more than eight years, demons have emerged in the midst of peace, they don't talk about unity and democracy, they put knives to the people's heads, things are grabbed and people are arrested, this year the wheat is good and they'll come to cut it, making our lives really hard.\" In the Pinghan area, the Kuomintang army in northern Henan has also transferred Li Ying and other puppet troops, old hands at seizing wheat for the past eight years, from Anyang to Fengsu and other places in Andong. After Wang Ziquan went to Xinxiang for instructions, they are now also concentrated in Xindianji, northwest of Anyang. According to this situation, the battle task of defending the summer harvest this year has been placed very seriously and urgently before the people of the liberated areas.

    "content": "In the spring ploughing movement in Piancheng, the following experiences were gained: (1) Retain mass commercial production and closely integrate agriculture and commerce. In the new small-scale cooperatives within the Mabu and Luanshiyan mutual aid societies, experienced people are selected to engage in commercial production, and their land is taken care of by the mutual aid group. Their slogan is: \"Make the best use of everyone's talents, do what you are good at.\" Therefore, the masses all participate in mutual aid. (2) Agricultural loans should be used in a concentrated manner. The 30,000 yuan loan in Xiyu was lent to 15 poor peasant households who jointly bought a donkey. On this basis, they organized themselves. (3) Use concrete facts to dispel the masses' confused thinking. In the past, the masses in Mabu believed that \"whoever becomes rich will be struggled against.\" Recently, at a mass meeting, the fact that Wen Qingyu, a rich peasant in the village, was not struggled against was used to educate the masses. The masses then realized that \"as long as you sweat yourself, eat your own food, wear your own clothes, and do not exploit others, there is no problem.\" (4) Actively support the ultra-poor to establish obligations. After discussion by the villagers in Hou Xiyu, the mutual aid group collectively cultivated wasteland for the ultra-poor, and the ultra-poor repaid the labor with rice work. Ultra-poor women spun cotton, and the cooperative lent her a catty of cotton as capital. This corrected the practice of simple relief and helped the ultra-poor and developed production.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n偏城  Piāncéng\n马布  Mǎbù\n乱石岩  Luànshíyán\n西峪  Xīyù\n温庆余  Wēn Qìngyú\n后西峪  Hòu Xīyù\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 偏城春耕运动中  获得四点经验\n\n1946-05-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　偏城春耕运动中\n    获得四点经验\n    【本报长治讯】偏城在春耕运动中，获得如下几点经验：（一）保留群众商业生产，密切农商业结合。马布、乱石岩互助社内新的小型合作社，选出有经验的人做商业生产，他的地由互助组照顾。他们的口号是：“人尽其材，会啥作啥”。因此群众都参加互助。（二）农业贷款要集中使用，西峪三万元贷款贷给十五户贫农，合买了一头驴，他们在这个基础上，便组织起来。（三）用具体事实解除群众糊涂思想。马布群众过去认为“谁富了就要斗争谁”，最近，群众大会上，拿本村富农温庆余并没被斗争的事实，教育群众，群众才认识到“只要流自己汗、吃自己饭、穿自己衣、不剥削人，甚问题也没有”。（四）从积极方面扶助赤贫建立义务。后西峪经过村民讨论，互助组集体给赤贫开荒，赤贫按米工还工。赤贫妇女纺花，合作社贷给她一斤花的本。这样改正了单纯救济的作法，以扶助赤贫，发展了生产。"

    "content": "Southern Hebei First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Districts\n    Peasants Universally Organize Farmers' Associations\n    Wenxi Strengthens Ideological Education, Exposing Illegal Landlords' Conspiracy to Sabotage Mass Movements.\n    [Our Correspondent in Weixian] Since Southern Hebei has boldly mobilized the masses, the political consciousness of the broad masses has been universally raised. Therefore, they urgently demand the establishment and consolidation of their own organizations to maintain the fruits of victory, organize to increase production, and strive to completely liberate themselves from poverty. In the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Districts, peasants in counties such as Qiuxian, Julu, and Jixian have universally established farmers' representative assemblies. In the Second District of Yuancheng County, after in-depth deliberation and \"networking\" by the masses, more than 1,500 people in thirteen villages spontaneously established farmers' representative assemblies, reflecting many of the masses' urgent desires. When the Seventh District was establishing its own organization, the peasants unanimously and enthusiastically participated in the election, on the spot exposing saboteurs who cast two votes, and discussed and decided on future work guidelines: (1) Handle all outstanding cases in the mass movement, such as factual basis, contracts, unity, and other issues. (2) Strengthen village-level organizations and consolidate mass armed forces. (3) Production should be based on agriculture, with the universal organization of mutual aid and cooperation to ensure that loans are used for production. After the meeting, thirty-two mutual aid groups were developed, greatly increasing production efficiency, and the fruit allocation problem was resolved in three days. Dishang Township in the Sixth District and Ma Township in the Fifth District have both served as key demonstration areas, gaining considerable experience and leading the work of the entire county. Guan County has entered a period of enthusiastic elections throughout the county. In the Fifth District, ten villages have universally established village farmers' associations, which have raised issues such as preventing spies and promoting production, submitting them to county farmers' association representatives. After the elections in each district, the county-level farmers' association was established on the 27th of last month, solving many important problems.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yangcheng, 22nd] The mass movement in Wenxi has achieved great results, with 70% of the villages in the county having been mobilized. However, during the movement, it was discovered that reactionary elements and stubborn landlords were sabotaging the mass movement. After the struggle was launched, some secret agents and illegal and domineering landlords, in order to shift the target of the struggle, disintegrate peasant unity, and regain the fruits of peasant victory, engaged in inciting disunity among the peasants, such as using large villages to oppress small villages, or main villages to oppress attached villages, provoking antagonism among the peasants of various villages. Furthermore, the right-wing rulers within the villages, in order to achieve their personal aims, induced and coerced peasants to participate in the struggle, resulting in infighting among the peasants in the villages. In addition, because the leadership initially did not focus on educating mass cadres, and the ideas of localism and sectarianism were not eliminated, the schemes of the domineering landlords found an opportunity to exploit. The leadership has now exposed this conspiracy and quickly carried out ideological education on \"Farmers of the world are one family.\" Under this new awareness, the masses in various villages have begun to unite and wage a joint struggle against the instigators. This shift, through the struggles of advanced villages, has influenced and driven backward villages, playing a significant role.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n冀南\tJìnán (Southern Hebei)\n邱县\tQiūxiàn (Qiuxian County)\n巨鹿\tJùlù (Julu County)\n冀县\tJìxiàn (Jixian County)\n元朝县\tYuáncháo xiàn (Yuancheng County)\n威县\tWēixiàn (Weixian County)\n阳城\tYángchéng (Yangcheng)\n闻喜\tWénxǐ (Wenxi)\n新华社\tXīnhuáshè (Xinhua News Agency)\n冠县\tGuānxìan (Guan County)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀南一、三、四、五分区  农民普遍组织农会  闻喜加强思想教育，揭穿非法地主破坏群运阴谋。\n\n1946-05-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀南一、三、四、五分区\n    农民普遍组织农会\n    闻喜加强思想教育，揭穿非法地主破坏群运阴谋。\n    【本报威县讯】冀南放手发动群众以来，广大群众政治觉悟普遍提高，因此急迫要求建立与巩固自己的组织，以保持胜利果实，组织起来增加生产，争取从穷困中彻底解放自己。一、三、四、五各分区的邱县、巨鹿、冀县等县的农民已普遍建立了农民代表会，元朝县二区经过群众深入酝酿和“串连”，十三村一千五百余人自动建立了农民代表会，会上反映了许多群众的迫切愿望。七区在建立自己组织时，农民一致热烈参加选举，当场检举了投两票的破坏分子，并讨论决定了今后工作方针：（一）处理群运中一切悬案，如果实、文契、团结等问题。（二）健全村级组织，巩固群众武装。（三）生产以农业为主，普遍组织互助合作，保证贷款用于生产。会后，互助组发展了三十二个，生产效率提高很多，果实问题在三天就处理完毕。六区的堤上小区，五区的马小区，都作了重点示范，得到不少经验，带领了全县工作。冠县全县都进入了热烈选举。五区有十个村普遍建立了村农会，纷纷提出防奸生产等各方面问题，交与县农会代表。各区选完后，上月二十七日建立了县级农会，解决了很多重要问题。\n    【新华社阳城廿二日电】闻喜群运已获很大成绩，全县百分之七十的村庄，已发动起来。但在运动中，发现反动分子及顽固地主破坏群运，当斗争发动后，一些特务分子及违法恶霸地主，为转移斗争目标，瓦解农民团结，夺回农民胜利果实，即进行煽惑鼓动农民内部不团结，如利用大村欺压小村，或主村欺压附村，挑拨各村农民的对立。又如村内右派统治者，为了达到其私人企图，诱胁农民参加斗争，结果形成村内农民的倾轧。此外，由于领导上开始对群众干部教育未抓紧，本位主义、宗派主义的思想未清除，也使恶霸地主的阴谋达到可乘之机。现领导上已将此阴谋予以戳穿，并迅速进行了“天下农民是一家”的思想教育，各村群众，在新的觉悟下，已开始团结起来，向挑拨者进行联合斗争，这一转变，通过先进村的斗争，影响带动落后村，起了重大作用。"

Their offensive deployment towards our Ji-Lu-Yu region is basically complete, and the opportunity for battle is imminent. The 29th Division of this army, combined with the puppet troops of Zhi Yongde, Chen Boyang, and others, has Cao County as its target; the main force of the 181st Division has Dingtao as its target, and the 74th Division has Heze as its target. Currently, the Kuomintang garrison in Kaocheng is busy preparing for battle; the 29th Division has already assembled in Zhuji (north of Shangqiu). Based on this situation, the Kuomintang's large-scale offensive is about to begin. The situation in our Ji-Lu-Yu region is extremely tense.\n    [Our Newspaper Heze 24th Telegram] The Kuomintang army around the border area does not abide by the truce agreement, destroys the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and attempts to provoke a full-scale civil war, repeatedly combining with puppet troops to attack the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas. According to incomplete statistics, since the issuance of the ceasefire order to today, within 130 days, they have attacked us as many as 110 times (the encirclement and suppression of our Henan East troops is not yet included in the statistics), using 640,000 troops, occupying more than 30 villages and towns in our Fourth Military Sub-district, such as Qingzhongji, Jingshitun, Dingluan, Nanzhen, Wei Yuan, and Changgang, Yuzhen, Huanggang, Huzhuang, and Foji in eastern Henan. The puppet troops of Du Shu in Dongming City, after receiving support and connivance from the Kuomintang, have become even more lawless, leaving the city to burn and kill our peaceful villagers, attacking our area as many as 40 times in two days. Now the people of the entire Ji-Lu-Yu region are unanimously mobilized to resolutely defend themselves. 500,000 people in Dongming, Nanhua, Changyuan, and Dongyuan are gathering everywhere to denounce the crimes of the puppet troops of Du Shu, demanding that our army lead the people to strike at the shameless offensive of these puppet troops.\n    [Heze 22nd Telegram] The Kuomintang 12th Army stationed in Changqing and the puppet Zhang Xianting's troops in the city, who were appointed as the county security team by the Kuomintang, continue to attack and plunder our area. On the 8th, this unit, totaling more than a thousand, built bunkers in Zhao Zhuang and Yuhuang Zhuang. On the 9th, more than 80 puppet Zhang Xianting's troops plundered villages in our Fourth Military Sub-district and forcibly collected taxes. On the morning of the 13th, more than 200 of these puppets attacked Sanzhuang (ten li south of the city), the garrison of the First Regiment of our First Military Sub-district, and were repelled by us. On the 15th, they even used six companies to attack our garrison in Pingfang (seventeen li south of the city). They were blocked by us on the same day and retreated to the vicinity of Sanzhuang, Chenzhuang, and Xinzhuang. These puppets actually built strongholds in the above villages, and we were forced to defend ourselves and drove them back on the 16th. We captured seven light machine guns, one small cannon, and killed or captured 136 puppet soldiers. On the 19th, more than 700 Kuomintang troops of an unknown number were added to the city from Jinan.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n军队\tArmy\n国民党军\tKuomintang Army\n伪军\tPuppet troops\n豫东部队\tHenan East troops\n解放区\tLiberated Areas\n\n人物\tPeople\n智永德\tZhi Yongde\n陈伯阳\tChen Boyang\n杜淑\tDu Shu\n张宪庭\tZhang Xianting\n邓小平\tDeng Xiaoping\n\n地点\tPlaces\n冀鲁豫区\tJi-Lu-Yu Region\n萧县\tXiao County\n夏邑\tXiayi\n曹县\tCao County\n定陶\tDingtao\n荷泽\tHeze\n考城\tKaocheng\n朱集\tZhuji\n商邱\tShangqiu\n清冢集\tQingzhongji\n井市屯\tJingshitun\n丁滦\tDingluan\n南镇\tNanzhen\n魏垣\tWei Yuan\n长岗\tChanggang\n圉镇\tYuzhen\n黄岗\tHuanggang\n湖庄\tHuzhuang\n佛集\tFoji\n东明\tDongming\n南华\tNanhua\n长垣\tChangyuan\n东垣\tDongyuan\n长清\tChangqing\n赵庄\tZhao Zhuang\n玉皇庄\tYuhuang Zhuang\n三庄\tSanzhuang\n平房\tPingfang\n陈庄\tChenzhuang\n辛庄\tXinzhuang\n济南\tJinan\n\n组织\tOrganizations\n国民党\tKuomintang\n人民日报\tPeople's Daily\n政治协商会议\tPolitical Consultative Conference\n第四分区\tFourth Military Sub-district\n第一分区\tFirst Military Sub-district\n\n军事单位\tMilitary Units\n五十五军\t55th Army\n二十九师\t29th Division\n一百八十一师\t181st Division\n七十四师\t74th Division\n十二军\t12th Army\n保安队\tSecurity Team\n第一团\tFirst Regiment\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫区形势紧张  国民党军亟图大进攻  国民党接济纵容东明伪军出城烧杀侵扰五十万人民要求我军领导打击伪军进攻\n\n1946-05-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀鲁豫区形势紧张\n    国民党军亟图大进攻\n    国民党接济纵容东明伪军出城烧杀侵扰五十万人民要求我军领导打击伪军进攻\n    【本报荷泽二十三日急电】配合国民党军进犯萧县夏邑向北猛犯的国民党五十五军，其向我冀鲁豫的进攻布置已大体就绪，战机一触即发。该部二十九师结合伪军智永德、陈伯阳等部之进攻目标为曹县；一百八十一师主力之进攻目标为定陶，七十四师之进攻目标为荷泽，刻下考城国民党驻军正忙于作战准备；二十九师已在朱集（商邱以北）集结。根据此种情况，国民党之大举进攻即将开始。我冀鲁豫区形势已万分紧张。\n    【本报荷泽二十四日电】边区周围国民党军不遵守停战协定，破坏政协决议，企图挑起全面内战，屡次结合伪军进攻解放区军民，据不完整统计，自停战令下达日至今一百三十日内，竟犯我达一百一十次（围攻我豫东部队尚未统计在内），使用兵力六十四万人，占我四分区之清冢集、井市屯、丁滦、南镇、魏垣、及豫东长岗、圉镇、黄岗、湖庄、佛集等三十余村镇。东明城内伪军杜淑部得到国民党接济与纵容后，更无法无天，出城烧杀我和平村民，曾在两天之内，进攻我区四十次之多，现我冀鲁豫全区人民一致动员坚决自卫。东明、南华、长垣、东垣五十万人民到处集合控诉伪军杜淑罪行，要求我军率领人民打击该伪军的无耻进攻。\n    【荷泽二十二日电】驻长清之国民党军十二军，及城内被国民党委为该县保安队之伪张宪庭部，继续向我区进攻抢掠，八日该部共千余，在赵庄、玉皇庄修筑碉堡，九日伪张宪庭部八十余至我四区一带村庄抢掠，并强征田赋，十三日上午该伪二百余向我一分区一团驻地三庄（城南十里）进攻，被我击退。十五日更以六个中队向我平房（城南十七里）驻军进攻，当日为我阻击，退至三庄、陈庄、辛庄一带，该伪竟在以上村庄修筑据点，我被迫自卫，于十六日将其逐退，我缴获轻机枪七挺，小炮一门，毙俘伪百三十六名。十九日又有不明番号之国民党军七百余，由济南增至该城。"

    "content": "“Some Rejoice, Some Grieve”\n    Anyang Miscellany\n\n      “A city of officials, half a city of people, the common folk don't count.\n      Longing for the Central Government, hoping for the Central Government, but when the Central Government arrives, the people suffer.”\n\n    This folk rhyme circulating in the streets and alleys of Anyang City is a good portrait of the city itself.\n\n    Anyang streets are filled with soldiers and officials. The soldiers are still wearing cotton uniforms, while the officials are dressed in \"wool.\" It is said that there are over 40,000 regular Kuomintang troops here, not including the incorporated puppet troops of Li Ying and Wang Ziquan. What about the civil officials? There are three special commissioner's offices and eight county governments: Ci County, Wu'an County, Neihuang County, Daming County, Handan County, Cheng'an County, and Anyang County. There are also the imposing and murderous Party officials from the eight counties.\n\n    According to the Kuomintang's new administrative divisions, Anyang County has a total of twenty-eight townships, but they only control nine. The people in these nine townships, accounting for one-third of the county, are now teetering on the brink of death under layers of exploitation. According to the receipts of the former puppet county magistrate, Sun Ziqing, in January alone, 1,160,000 jin of wheat and twice as much firewood (over 8,000,000 jin) were requisitioned. In addition, there were labor levies and materials, such as 15,000 railway sleepers, each valued at over 10,000 yuan, totaling 150 million yuan. In reality, each sleeper was only given a price of 500 to 800 yuan, not even enough for transportation costs. From the Kuomintang takeover until early March, the amount requisitioned with receipts reached 60,000,000 yuan. The puppet troops, who had always oppressed the people, became even more rampant after receiving the so-called benevolence of the National Army. The notorious traitor Li Ying, with just over a thousand men, used three different names to collect salaries for three units of six thousand men. When his troops went to the countryside, the people had to \"entertain\" them, adding 40% to the overall cost of each village. Every time he moved his defense, he bought new pots. Anyang City alone was forced to contribute over 3,000,000 yuan. Soldiers could use slips to demand anything they wanted from the baojia chiefs. They could also take prostitutes to bathe, creating a chaotic mess. The cadres under the traitorous local emperor Wang Ziquan used various pretexts to seize land from the people. While the people's blood dried up, they became fat. Many now own one or two qing of land. Are other armies any better? As far as I know, the only difference is that they pay lip service to propriety, righteousness, and integrity, but in practice, they are generally the same.\n\n    \"The common people can't survive!\" Such resentful voices echo from every village. People can barely eat one bowl of thin congee a day, at most two. Over a thousand people have already starved to death in one village. But those who have not died must tighten their belts and join the anti-communist organizations—the Militia, the National Defense Corps—receive special training, and be issued five major \"certificates\": Citizen Certificate, Pass, Residence Permit, Vendor's License, and Beggar's Certificate. The Citizen Certificate is exactly the same as the \"Good Citizen Certificate\" used by the enemy to rule the Chinese people, except for the addition of a \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" emblem.\n\n    Let's take a look at the lives of the high-ranking officials who exploit the people's wealth!\n\n    The \"receiving\" heroes who descended from the sky and the \"patriotic fighters\" who emerged from the shadows, after the Japanese surrendered, all crossed the sea like the Eight Immortals, each displaying their unique skills. \"What's yours is mine too,\" they grabbed everywhere, fighting for houses, cars, sofas, sneaking out the back door after sealing the front, closing the big door but opening the small door. The houses sealed by the county government were quietly unsealed by the special commissioner's office at night. Then, the army tore off the seals of the special commissioner's office. The officers were busy making American-style wool uniforms, each costing 150,000 to 160,000 yuan, and hanging \"V\" for Victory badges on their chests, driving cars, speeding back and forth on the streets, how \"glorious\"! They are even better at socializing, with each banquet costing 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. At this grand feast, they toast either the general who \"contributed to the war of resistance\" or the \"underground worker.\" Amidst the clinking of glasses and the exchange of toasts, how joyous! After the drinks and tea, they play four rounds of \"mahjong,\" winning or losing tens of thousands of yuan each time. Can the sound of the people's hunger awaken their \"humanity\" here?\n\n    Before the war, Anyang was a cultural city in northern Henan, with eight high schools and middle schools, and over 3,000 students. After the Kuomintang takeover, Anyang Provincial High School and the Provincial Middle School also moved back, but the total number of students is only over two hundred. Private schools charge two to three million yuan in tuition and miscellaneous fees per student, leaving poor children to only sigh at the school's door! This has created the following phenomenon: on one hand, students who have dropped out of school wander the streets; on the other hand, schools are empty. Five elementary schools were taken over, with forty-eight classes, totaling over 1,700 students, some of whom are still studying the New People's textbooks left by the enemy!\n\n    The schools are controlled by party thugs. The principal of Henan Provincial Second High School is Yang Zhendong, a CC clique member. The director of moral education is Wu Peilin, a Fuxing clique member. The principal of Zhangde Middle School is Huang Boying, the head of the Anyang Sanqing Tuan.... The Sanqing Tuan is active in various schools, forcing students to join. Those who don't join are suspected of being communist bandits. Under these circumstances, two-thirds of the students at Zhangde Middle School have been \"partified,\" and a quarter of the students at the provincial high school have been \"partified\"...

    "content": "International Commentary\n            Paris Foreign Ministers Conference\n    The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, which opened in Paris on April 25th and lasted for three weeks, adjourned on the 16th of this month and decided to reconvene on the 16th of next month.\n    This Four Foreign Ministers Conference reached agreements on certain issues, such as the Finnish peace treaty, the ×× border, and the borders of Bulgaria. Agreements were also largely reached on the preamble to the Italian peace treaty and the handling of the Italian fleet.\n    However, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference still failed to reach agreements on several other important issues. Therefore, this conference could not complete the task set by the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference at the end of last year, which was for the four powers to reach a common agreement on the draft peace treaties for Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, and then submit these drafts to the Paris Peace Conference, which would be composed of twenty-one countries, for approval. The completion of this task still depends on the continued discussions of the four foreign ministers' assistants currently staying in Paris and the reconvening of the four foreign ministers on the 16th of next month.\n    The focal points of contention at this Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, to name the main ones, were the Trieste issue and the handling of Italian colonies. In addition, as the conference was about to conclude, the US side proposed submitting the issues already decided and undecided by the Foreign Ministers Conference to the Peace Conference for discussion, as it estimated that fifteen or sixteen of the twenty-one countries participating in the Peace Conference would side with the United States. Regarding this issue, the Soviet Union, based on the decision of the Moscow Conference at the end of last year, insisted that the four powers must reach an agreement on all major issues before the Peace Conference is held. This proposal by the Soviet Union was finally approved by the conference.\n    Looking at this Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference, although it did not resolve issues as smoothly as the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference at the end of last year, it was also very different from the London Foreign Ministers Conference in September last year, which ended without results. Several points about this Paris Foreign Ministers Conference are worth noting: First, the main disputes at this conference occurred between the United States and the Soviet Union, rather than between Britain and the Soviet Union as in the London Conference. Second, the differences between the United States and Britain became increasingly apparent. Regarding the handling of Italian colonies, the differences between Britain and the United States became even more obvious after the Soviet Union expressed concessions. Third, although the debates at this conference were fierce, the atmosphere was relatively relaxed, leaving room for mediation, and agreements were reached on some issues.\n    Therefore, there is still hope that the issues not resolved at this conference will be agreed upon when the conference reopens on the 16th of next month, because in the near future, the Peace Conference will eventually be held, and the peace treaties for Finland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Italy will eventually be signed.\n            Anglo-American Relations\n    The US Senate passed a $3.748 billion loan to Britain on the 10th of this month. This does not mean that the contradictions between Britain and the United States (the two major countries in the capitalist system) in the post-war world economic sphere have weakened. On the contrary, these contradictions will become increasingly acute, because the purpose of this loan by the United States, as US Secretary of State Byrnes said on the 16th of last month, \"is not for the revival of Britain.\" As conditions for the loan to Britain, the United States insisted that Britain make many economic concessions, such as abandoning imperial preference, abolishing the sterling area, removing tariff barriers, etc. This allows US capital to penetrate areas within Britain's sphere of influence, which will inevitably cause fierce resistance from the British side. Because Britain consumed most of its overseas investment in this war, if it wants to import the food and raw materials necessary to restore its pre-war living standards every year after the war, it needs to increase its pre-war exports by 50%, that is, it needs a larger world market than in the past. Therefore, Britain has to engage in fierce competition with the United States worldwide. Britain made such painful concessions and humbled itself in this loan (even British nobles enthusiastically agreed to lend the Magna Carta of 1215, which has always been regarded as a \"national treasure,\" to the United States to show \"friendship\"), simply because it could not obtain the loan otherwise, and without this loan, it would be extremely difficult for Britain to recover from the wounds of the war. The Labor government, representing the British Empire, deeply feels the huge difficulties of Britain's post-war transition period, and hopes that in the near future, after receiving tens of billions of dollars in funding to reorganize its forces, it will be able to deal with the United States; and on the US side, it also needs the world market. Its post-war annual exports cannot be satisfied with a slight increase over the pre-war amount (4 to 5 billion US dollars), but must be two or even three times the pre-war amount, otherwise an economic crisis of overproduction will occur. This is the basis for the increasingly fierce struggle between Britain and the United States for the world market after the war.\n    Even now, many facts show that Anglo-American contradictions have gradually increased since the end of the war. Even when the US Senate was discussing the loan to Britain, isolationist senators strongly opposed the loan. The debate lasted for four weeks, and as many as 34 voted against it. American isolationists such as Hurley, Taft, and Hoover dream of America's world hegemony, hoping to take advantage of Britain's post-war fatigue, take all of Britain's markets, and subdue Britain to become America's \"economic appendage\" without providing any assistance. In fact, American capital is currently actively penetrating and operating within Britain's sphere of influence, trying to squeeze out Britain. The investment of American oil companies and airlines in the Middle East is greatly increasing, and London newspapers are extremely dissatisfied with this. The United States has now broken the Anglo-Siamese Economic Agreement that Britain wanted to monopolize Siam and signed an Anglo-American-Siamese Economic Agreement. The United States is now using the famine in Britain and its territories as a weapon to pressure Britain to make new economic concessions, and even since Japan's surrender, the United States has stopped providing Britain with information on the development of atomic energy. This is also the reason why some British figures (such as Laski) have recently accused the United States of monopolizing the technical secrets of atomic energy and demanded international co-management. In other respects, there are also disputes between Britain and the United States, such as the United States' efforts to occupy British bases where US troops were stationed during the war, especially British islands in the Pacific. This has recently occupied the front pages of British newspapers, with articles opposing this move by the United States as \"imperialist expansion.\" In the Allied Council for Japan, the British representative is also similarly dissatisfied with MacArthur's arbitrary actions.\n            The Course of the Japanese Cabinet Crisis\n    The Japanese cabinet crisis, after several twists and turns, has now come to a temporary end as Yoshida, the new president of the Liberal Party, has been ordered to form a cabinet.\n    This cabinet crisis began after the general election on the 10th of last month. Due to the results of the \"general election,\" the power of various factions of the Japanese ruling class has changed. The Liberal Party, mainly backed by the Mitsui zaibatsu, holds the first party position in the new parliament. The party had formed an alliance with Shidehara to take charge of the general election. After the general election, this alliance broke down due to the struggle for power and profit. At that time, the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan successively convened meetings, and representatives from the Soviet Union, New Zealand, Australia, and other Allied countries criticized the Shidehara cabinet without reservation. Therefore, the Shidehara cabinet was forced to resign en masse on the 22nd of last month.\n    After Shidehara's downfall, fierce struggles broke out within Japan over the issue of forming a cabinet. First, there was the struggle between the forces of the democratic front and the forces of the anti-democratic front. Democratic parties led by the Japanese Communist Party and Katō Kanjū, the leader of the left wing of the Socialist Party, demanded the establishment of a democratic coalition government; while anti-democratic parties plotted to organize a reactionary coalition cabinet to resist democratic forces. Among the various reactionary factions, the struggle for cabinet positions unfolded. At that time, there was the Shidehara faction, plotting to cling to power and win over the Progressive Party, opposing the Liberal Party (the background of which was the struggle between the Mitsubishi zaibatsu and the Mitsui zaibatsu); some members of the right wing of the Socialist Party united with the Liberal Party to oppose Shidehara; another part of the right wing of the Socialist Party colluded with a part of the National Cooperative Party representing the large landlords in the northeast to oppose the Liberal Party; the Liberal Party courted members of the National Cooperative Party representing landlords in Kanto and Kansai (who have connections with industry) to oppose the Shidehara faction and the Progressive Party.\n    The infighting among the Japanese reactionary forces also gave the democratic forces favorable conditions for development. Therefore, cunning bureaucrats in the ruling class believed that it was necessary to step forward to mediate and make the reactionary factions re-compromise; at the same time, MacArthur stated that \"the chaos of cabinet formation must not continue.\" On the 29th of last month, Matsumoto Tsuneo, a senior official in the Japanese imperial court, acted as a \"peacemaker\" and worked hard to mediate. On the 4th of this month, it was decided that Hatoyama would form a single-party cabinet.\n    However, because the Japanese people and Allied public opinion had continuously exposed Hatoyama's democratic disguise for a long time, and the Allied representatives in the Allied Council for Japan had also criticized Hatoyama's cabinet formation plot, MacArthur rejected the Emperor's request to appoint Hatoyama to form a cabinet on the 4th of this month. Therefore, Shidehara was forced to recommend Katayama Tetsu, the secretary of the Socialist Party, to succeed him in forming a cabinet.\n    When Shidehara recommended Katayama, he initially attempted to use Katayama as a guise to form a reactionary cabinet, thereby deceiving the Allied countries and deceiving the people at home. However, Katayama is a middle-of-the-road figure in the Socialist Party. The left and right wings of the party are evenly matched. The left wing strongly advocates the establishment of a coalition cabinet with the Japanese Communist Party and other democratic parties; the right wing tries to exclude the Japanese Communist Party and form an anti-democratic coalition cabinet with reactionary leaders such as the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party, putting Katayama in a dilemma. At this time, the Japanese Communist Party and the broad masses of the people actively urged Katayama to form a democratic government. The Japanese ruling class deeply feared \"lifting a stone to drop it on one's own feet.\" On the one hand, they made the Emperor delay formally authorizing Katayama to form a cabinet, and on the other hand, they convened a conference of various reactionary factions to resist the democratic forces.\n    The internal compromise of the Japanese ruling class proceeded in two directions: one was within the Liberal Party. After Hatoyama was deposed, the party split into three factions (namely, the Hatoyama faction, the Ashida faction, and the Yoshida faction), vying for the leadership of the party. Finally, the internal strife was temporarily quelled with Yoshida being elected as president; the other was that through the activities of Shidehara, Yoshida, and Matsumoto, the three major parties of the Japanese ruling class—the Liberal Party, the Progressive Party, and the National Cooperative Party—also temporarily eased their mutual infighting. Therefore, on the 16th of this month, the Emperor authorized Yoshida to form a cabinet. Yoshida is not only the president of the Liberal Party, which mainly represents Mitsui's interests, but also a figure who communicates with Mitsubishi's agent Shidehara and the Progressive Party, and a diplomatic bureaucrat who had a relationship with British and American appeasers. It can be predicted that the new Japanese cabinet headed by Yoshida will be a coalition cabinet of various Japanese reactionary parties. In the future, the struggle between the democratic front and the anti-democratic front in Japan will become more acute. The demonstrations by the masses in Tokyo against Yoshida's cabinet formation were the beginning of this.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    China\n芬兰   Finland\n意大利  Italy\n罗马尼亚  Romania\n保加利亚 Bulgaria\n匈牙利  Hungary\n巴黎    Paris\n莫斯科  Moscow\n伦敦    London\n的里雅斯特  Trieste\n美国    United States\n苏联    Soviet Union\n英国    Britain\n贝纳斯  Byrnes\n赫尔利  Hurley\n塔虎特  Taft\n胡佛   Hoover\n暹罗   Siam\n拉斯基  Laski\n日本   Japan\n吉田   Yoshida\n三井   Mitsui\n币原   Shidehara\n远东委员会  Far Eastern Commission\n加藤勘十  Katō Kanjū\n三菱   Mitsubishi\n松本恒雄  Matsumoto Tsuneo\n鸠山   Hatoyama\n片山哲   Katayama Tetsu\n芦田   Ashida\n关东   Kantō\n关西   Kansai\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国际述评\n\n1946-05-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国际述评\n            巴黎外长会议\n    四月二十五日，在巴黎召开的四强外长会议，历时三周，已于本月十六日宣告休会，并决定于下月十六日再行召集。\n    这次四外长会议，曾在某些问题上取得了协议，例如在芬兰和约、××边界、保国疆界等问题上，会议皆曾获得协议，而在对意和约序言及处理意大利舰队上，也大致取得协议。\n    但是，四外长会议在另外几个重要问题上，仍然未获协议，因而这次会议还不能完成去年底莫斯科三外长会议所规定的任务，就是由四强取得关于意、罗、保、匈、芬诸国的和约草案的共同协议，然后再将这些草案提交将由二十一国组成的巴黎和会通过，这一任务的完成，尚有待于目前留在巴黎的四国外长助理的继续商讨，与下月十六日四外长的再次会议。\n    这次巴黎外长会议的争执焦点，举其要者，有的里雅斯特问题，及意殖民地的处理问题。此外，在会议将完之时，美方曾提出将外长会议已决及未决问题提交和会讨论，因为它估计到参加和会的二十一国中，有十五六国会站在美国方面。关于这个问题，苏联根据去年底莫斯科会议决定，坚主在和会举行以前，四强对于各项重大问题，必须获致协议。苏联这一主张，终于获得会议的赞同。\n    综观这次巴黎四外长会议，虽然未能如去年底莫斯科三外长会议的顺利解决问题，但也和去年九月无结果而散的伦敦外长会议大有不同。关于这次巴黎外长会议有几点值得注意：第一，这次会议的主要争执，发生于美苏之间，而不象伦敦会议中，乃是英苏发生争论。第二，美英之间分歧日趋明显，关于意大利殖民地处理问题，在苏联表示让步之后，英美的分歧更是显而易见。第三，这次会议争论虽然剧烈，但是气氛较为缓和，留有斡旋余地，并且在某些问题上，也曾获得协议。\n    因此，这次会议所未曾解决的问题，在下月十六日会议重开之时，仍然有获得协议的希望，因为在不久的将来，和会终究是要召开的，对芬、罗、保、匈、意的和约，也终究是要签订的。\n            英美关系\n    本月十日美国参院通过了三十七亿四千八百万美元的对英贷款，这并不意味着英美（资本主义体系中的两大国）在战后世界经济领域内的矛盾减弱了，相反的，这种矛盾将愈趋尖锐，因为美国这一贷款的目的，如美国务卿贝纳斯于上月十六日所说的，“并不是为了英国复兴”，作为对英贷款的条件，美国坚持要英国作许多经济让步，如各方所传的放弃帝国优先权，废止英镑集团，撤除关税壁垒等等，这就使美国资本能够渗入属于英国势力范围的地区，其结果必然引起英国方面的剧烈的抗拒。因为英国在这次战争中消耗了海外投资的大部，如果在战后要每年输入供其恢复战前生活水平所必须的食粮和原料，就要增加其战前输出的百分之五十，也就是说，需要比过去更广大的世界市场，因而英国就不得不在全世界范围内，对美国作剧烈的竞争。英国在这次贷款中之所以如此忍痛让步，低声下气（甚至英国的贵族亦竟热烈地赞成将一向被视为“国宝”的一二一五年自由大宪章借给美国，以示“友好”），无非是因为非此不能得到贷款，而没有这笔贷款，英国就极难使其战争的创伤恢复过来。代表大英帝国的工党政府，深深感到英国战后过渡时期的巨大困难，而指望着在不久的将来，在得到数十亿美元的挹注而重整旗鼓之后，能与美国相周旋；而在美国方面，它亦需要世界市场。它的战后每年输出，决不能比战前的数额（四十至五十亿美元）稍为增加就会满足，而必须两倍以至三倍于战前，否则就发生生产过剩的经济危机。这就是战后英美为角逐世界市场的斗争，将愈趋激烈的根据。\n    即使在目前许多事实，也显示着英美矛盾已随战争结束而日渐增长，就是在美参院讨论对英贷款时，孤立派的参议员极力反对贷款，争论历时四周之久，投票反对者竟达三十四票之多。美国孤立分子如赫尔利、塔虎特、胡佛之流，憧憬着美国的世界霸权，盼不得乘英国战后疲敝之际，尽取英国的市场，压服英国成为美国的“经济尾闾”，而不给以任何援助。事实上，美国资本目前正积极的渗入英国势力范围内活动，千方百计地排挤英国，美国的石油公司和航空公司在中东的投资正大大的增长中，伦敦报纸对此已异常不满。美国目前已打破英国要独占暹罗的英暹经济协定，而订立英美暹三国经济协定。美国现正利用英国及其所辖地区的粮荒，以救济作为压迫英国作新的经济让步的武器，甚至自日本投降以后，美国已停止供给英国关于原子能发展的情报，这也是近来英国若干人物（如拉斯基等）责备美国垄断原子能的技术秘密而要求国际共管的缘因。在其他方面，英美中间也存在着争端，如美国力图霸占在战争中有美军驻扎的英国基地，特别在太平洋上的英属岛屿，这在最近已占英国报纸的首页地位，并有著文反对，形容美国此举为“帝国主义扩张”者。在盟国对日委员会上，英国代表亦同样不满麦克阿瑟的独断独行。\n            日本阁潮的经过\n    日本的阁潮，经过了几度风波之后，目前已因自由党新总裁吉田受命组阁而暂告结束了。\n    这次阁潮是在上月十日的大选之后开始的，由于“大选”的结果，日本统治阶级各派的势力有所消长，以三井财阀为主要背景的自由党占有新议会的第一党地位，该党曾与币原结成同盟，包办大选，在大选后，这一同盟就因争权夺利而告破裂，而远东委员会、对日委员会又于当时相继集会，苏、纽、澳等盟国代表，抨击币原内阁不遗余力，于是币原内阁被迫于上月二十二日总辞职了。\n    币原垮台后，环绕着组阁问题，日本国内即掀起激烈的斗争，首先是民主阵线势力与反民主阵线势力的斗争。以日共与社会党左派领袖加藤勘十等为首的民主党派，要求成立民主联合政府；而反民主党派策动组织反动派联合内阁，以抵制民主势力。此次各反动派内部，因争夺内阁地盘而展开的斗争，当时有币原一派，阴谋恋栈而拉拢进步党，反对自由党的斗争（其背景是三菱财阀与三井财阀之间的斗争）；有社会党右派一部分分子联合自由党，反对币原的斗争；有社会党右派另一部分分子，与国民协同党中代表东北部们大地主的部分相勾结，以反对自由党的斗争；有自由党笼络国民协同党中代表关东、关西地主（他与工业有联系）的分子，反对币原一派和进步党的斗争。\n    日本反动势力内部的斗争，也给了民主势力发展以有利条件，所以，统治阶级中老练狡猾的官僚，便认为有出面调停使反动派内部重谋妥协的必要；同时麦克阿瑟对于日本统治阶级内部的斗争，曾表示“组阁的混乱不容再继续下去。”到了上月二十九日，日本宫庭大官僚松本恒雄，即以“和事佬”自居而奔走折冲。至本月四号，便决定由鸠山成立一党内阁。\n    可是，因为日本人民与盟国舆论，许久以来对鸠山的民主伪装不断予以揭发，而对日委员会中盟国代表也曾抨击鸠山组阁阴谋，麦克阿瑟乃于本月四日当天否决日皇任命鸠山组阁的呈请，于是币原被迫推荐社会党书记片山哲继起组阁。\n    币原推荐片山时，最初曾企图以片山为幌子，成立反动内阁，借此既能蒙蔽盟国，又可欺骗国内人民。但是片山为社会党内中派人物，该党左右翼势均力敌，左派力主与日共等民主党派成立联合内阁；右派则力图排挤日共，而与自由党、进步党等反动领袖成立反民主的联合内阁，使片山处于左右为难的境地，而日共与广大人民，此时则积极敦促片山成立民主政府。日本统治阶级深恐“搬起石头打自己的脚”，乃一方面使日皇迟迟不正式授命片山组阁，另一方面并召开各反动派的大会，以抗拒民主势力。\n    日本统治阶级的内部妥协，沿两个方向进行：一个是在自由党内部，该党以鸠山被黜后，曾分裂为三派（即鸠山派、芦田派、吉田派），争夺党的领导权，终于以吉田被推为总裁而暂息内争；另一个是经过币原、吉田与松本的活动，日本统治阶级三大党——自由党、进步党与国民协同党之间，也暂时缓和了相互倾轧，于是本月十六日日皇乃授命吉田组阁。吉田既是主要代表三井利益的自由党的总裁，又是与三菱代理人币原及进步党互通声气的人物，而且是与英美绥靖主义者们有过一段瓜葛的外交官僚。可以预计，以吉田为首的日本新阁，将是日本各反动党派的联合内阁。今后日本国内民主阵线与反民主阵线的斗争，必将更加尖锐起来，日本东京群众示威反对吉田组阁，即为其肇始。"

Over the past month, the property registration has been completed. Except for traitors, all shareholders of the original private Zhongyuan Company are recognized for their equity, and they are being re-registered. The portion belonging to the British Fu Company (whose British personnel left after the Japanese invaders occupied Jiaozuo) is temporarily under government trusteeship. The shares and property of traitors are also being evaluated and transferred to recruit new shareholders. Recently, the company held its first shareholders' meeting. Mr. Jia Linfang, a capitalist from Chahar Province, along with 24 shareholders from various regions who invested here, and Mr. Wang Zhongjing, Wang Qiaosong, Jin Yunzhi, Du Yu, Sun Shizhi and other shareholders from the original Zhongyuan Company, attended the meeting with extreme excitement. Everyone unanimously praised the democratic government for implementing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and supporting the development of private capital. The original shareholders of the Zhongyuan Company were especially grateful to the Eighth Route Army democratic government for resolving the protection of private capital in the mine. Deputy Manager Chen of the mining area then reported on the preparations for the Xinhua Joint-Stock Company. He specifically pointed out that when the Jiaozuo mining area was liberated, the enemy tried every possible means to destroy the Dongda Well with explosives and flood the No. 39 Well. The Eighth Route Army rescued the mine shafts and workers at the cost of thousands of casualties. After the democratic government took over, it actively enhanced equipment, repaired the mine shafts, provided relief to the workers, and improved production efficiency, so that the daily production volume per person quickly increased from three-fifths of a ton to 1.1 tons, nearly reaching the pre-war production level of 1.2 tons. This time, according to the decision of the border region government to support private capital, many capitalists have participated in the joint operation of the mine, enabling the mining industry to achieve greater development. Finally, Deputy Manager Chen carefully presented the accounts for the inventory and valuation of the entire mine's property for review by the conference, which was unanimously approved. On the 20th, the conference elected the company's directors and supervisors. Mr. Jia Linfang, a capitalist from Chahar Province, was elected as the chairman of the board.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\nPlaces:\n\n邯郸\tHandan\n河南\tHenan\n焦作\tJiaozuo\n察哈尔省\tChahar Province\n\nOrganizations:\n\n新华煤矿股份有限公司\tXinhua Coal Mine Joint-Stock Company\n中原公司\tZhongyuan Company\n福公司\tFu Company\n八路军\tEighth Route Army\n\nPeople:\n\n贾林放\tJia Linfang\n王仲荆\tWang Zhongjing\n王荞松\tWang Qiaosong\n靳允之\tJin Yunzhi\n杜毓\tDu Yu\n孙适之\tSun Shizhi\n陈副经理\tDeputy Manager Chen\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 扶植发展私人资本  焦作煤矿改股份公司  承认原股东股权并招收新股\n\n1946-05-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　扶植发展私人资本\n    焦作煤矿改股份公司\n    承认原股东股权并招收新股\n    【本报邯郸讯】河南焦作煤矿在民主政府扶植发展私人资本政策下，已改为新华煤矿股份有限公司。月余以来，已将财产登记完毕，除原私营之中原公司股东（汉奸除外）一律承认其股权，并给以重新登记外，英人福公司部分（该公司英人，自日寇侵占焦作后即离去）则暂由政府代管，汉奸股份及其财产，亦估价转让，招收新股东。日前该公司召开第一次股东大会，察哈尔省资本家贾林放先生，及各地来此投资的股东二十四人，原中原公司股东王仲荆、王荞松、靳允之、杜毓、孙适之等先生，均以极度兴奋的心情参加大会。大家一致盛赞民主政府执行政协决议，扶植私人资本发展的政策。原中原公司诸股东，更特别感激八路军民主政府解决该矿保护私人资本之恩德。矿区陈副经理接着报告新华股份公司筹备经过，他特别指出焦作矿区解放时，敌人曾千方百计以炸药破坏东大井，水淹三十九号井，八路军以千人伤亡的代价，才解救了该矿矿井和工人。民主政府接管后，更积极增强设备，修补矿井，救济工人，提高生产效率，致每人每日生产量，迅速由五分之三吨，增至一吨一，几达战前一吨二之生产水平，此次根据边区政府扶植私人资本的决定，使许多资本家，参加该矿共同经营，使矿业得到更大的发展。最后陈副经理将全矿财产清理和估价帐目，慎重提出，请大会复审，当获一致通过。二十日，大会选出公司董事及监察人，察省资本家贾林放先生被选为董事长。"

After the mass rally, it turned into a massive march and demonstration. At that time, mechanized cavalry units of the American army patrolled the vicinity of the Imperial Palace in armored vehicles, equipped with machine guns and light artillery, with their covers removed, as if facing a formidable enemy. However, the masses still presented a petition to the Emperor, stating: \"We laborers, due to hunger, cannot continue to work hard and cannot maintain our survival. However, the current government can do nothing to improve the people's living conditions. We demand that the Emperor allow the people to manage the food themselves and organize a new government.\" Kato Kanju, a left-wing leader of the Socialist Party and one of the organizers of the Tokyo mass rally, demanded that the food hidden by the wealthy be distributed to the people and a democratic government be established. A representative of the Japanese Communist Party said: \"We workers demand that the food rations given to the workers be at least sufficient to keep them working.

    "content": "[Dispatch from our newspaper in Handan, 21st] On the 16th, puppet troops inside Yongnian city violated the ceasefire agreement by opening fire and wounding our comrade, Platoon Leader Chen Fu, causing immense indignation among the military and civilians outside Yongnian city. It is generally believed that the provocative behavior of these puppet troops has become even more疯狂嚣张 since the American and KMT representatives of the Yongnian Executive Team entered Yongnian city. To understand the truth of the matter, this reporter visited places like Nanqiao Town and Xida Dike, and interviewed relevant personnel. The facts are as follows: Since the KMT and American representatives entered Yongnian city, the puppet troops inside the city began firing at our military and civilians outside the Xiguan gate from the third artillery position inside the west gate starting on the morning of the 16th, firing over a hundred rounds. Comrade Chen Fu, platoon leader of the 1st platoon, 1st company, 1st brigade of the 3rd sub-district of Southern Hebei, was inspecting local fisherman from a wooden boat on the embankment outside Xiguan. He was shot in the left leg by the puppet troops, the bullet passing straight through, and was seriously wounded. He was immediately sent to the rear hospital of the 3rd sub-district for treatment. Our side protested the above-mentioned provocative behavior of the puppet troops to the team. After receiving the letter, American representative Lt. Col. Olson, accompanied by KMT representative Lt. Col. Zhang Chaozheng, came to Tanxiapo on the afternoon of the 17th and, together with our representative, Col. Zhao Haifeng, went to the scene of the incident at Xida Dike to conduct an investigation and listen to the report by Political Commissar Tian and Company Commander Qin Jiuru of the garrison troops on the incident of the puppet troops' provocation and shooting, as well as the injury of Platoon Leader Chen Fu.\n    On the 19th, in order to further understand the truth of the Xida Dike incident, the KMT and American representatives, accompanied by our representative, went to our rear hospital in Laoying Village to investigate. American representative Olson personally examined Platoon Leader Chen Fu's wound and inquired in detail about the circumstances of Platoon Leader Chen's injury. He believed that there was no doubt that it was the puppet troops who had inflicted the wound. After examining the wound of Platoon Leader Chen, who was groaning in pain on the hospital bed and was seriously injured, KMT representative Lt. Col. Zhang Chaozheng still made unreasonable excuses, attempting to evade responsibility for the shooting. Our representative firmly stated that the arrogant behavior of the puppet troops in violating the ceasefire agreement should be severely punished, and requested the team to report to the Peiping Executive Headquarters and immediately order the Communist troops to accept the surrender of the puppet troops in the city and dissolve them.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n永年  Yongnian\n邯郸  Handan\n陈辅  Chen Fu\n冀南三分区  Jinan Third Military Subdistrict\n一大队  First Brigade\n南桥镇  Nanqiao Town\n西大堤  Xida Dike\n奥尔森  Olson\n张朝正  Zhang Chaozheng\n赵海枫  Zhao Haifeng\n田政委  Political Commissar Tian\n秦九如  Qin Jiuru\n老营村  Laoying Village\n北平执行部  Peiping Executive Headquarters\n西关  Xiguan\n滩下坡  Tanxiapo\n国民党  Kuomintang (KMT)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 永年小组证实伪军挑衅  我力请受降解散伪军\n\n1946-05-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　永年小组证实伪军挑衅\n    我力请受降解散伪军\n    【本报邯郸二十一日讯】十六日永年城内伪军违犯停战协定开枪打伤我方排长陈辅同志，引起永年城外军民万分愤恨，咸认伪军此种挑衅行为，自永年执行小组美方与国方代表进入永年城后，益加疯狂嚣张。记者为了解此事发生真象，当至南桥镇及西大堤等地视察，并访问有关人员，据悉事实经过如下：自国美两方代表进入永年城后，城内伪军从十六日上午起即在西门内第三炮台处向西关外我方军民开枪射击，连发百余弹，冀南三分区一大队一中队一排排长陈辅同志适在西关外大堤木船上参观老百姓捕鱼。遭伪军射中左腿，贯穿一洞，负伤甚重，当即送入三分区后方医院救治。我方当将上述伪军挑衅行为，向小组提出抗议，美代表奥尔森中校接信后，于十七日下午偕国方代表张朝正中校，来滩下坡，会同我方代表赵海枫上校前往西大堤出事地点进行调查，并听取驻军田政委与秦九如连长报告伪军挑衅打枪经过及排长陈辅同志受伤情形。\n    十九日，小组为进一步了解西大堤事件真象，国美双方代表在我方代表陪同下，前往老营村我后方医院调查，美代表奥尔森亲验陈辅排长之伤口，对陈排长受伤经过询问颇详。认为确系伪军打伤无疑，国方代表张朝正中校检验我呻吟病床身负重伤之陈排长伤口后，仍无理狡辩，企图推诿打枪责任，我代表坚称伪军此种违犯停战协定之狂妄行为，应予严厉制裁，要求小组报告北平执行部允即下令中共部队受降并解散城内伪军。"

    "content": "US Foreign Policy Presents New Trends\n    Attempting to Establish a World Base Network\n    Contradictions Arise Between British and American Interests\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd] According to TASS, Moscow: Both *Pravda* and *Red Star* published articles on the 19th commenting on the US expansion of bases. *Pravda*, in an article entitled \"Using a World Base System as a Weapon of Expansionist Policy,\" pointed out that many American political commentators regard the \"world base system\" as a very definite direction and plan for US foreign policy after the war. Wheeler's book, *Bases Overseas*, designs a plan for the US to encircle the world with bases, and exposes the clear tendency of American expansionist groups and their attitude toward solving post-war problems. *Pravda* pointed out that the establishment of a US base network is by no means the result of the fantasies of this or that American journalist, but one of the most fundamental methods that has been put into practice. The \"base network\" plan has been realized in the negotiations on the US base in Iceland. Their activities in Africa, the Near East, and China are well known. It is noteworthy that Benes and Bevin held negotiations in Paris regarding US bases on Pacific islands. The new trend in US foreign policy represents an important change in the positions of the major US parties—the Republican Party and the Democratic Party—on foreign policy issues. The reactionary forces of American isolationism have turned to the dominance of an active expansionist policy when they put forward new plans, defining their task as establishing US dominance throughout the world. This is the approach of Vandenberg and his followers. One cannot fail to recognize that after Roosevelt's death, the views on foreign policy between the leaders of isolationism and certain leading groups of the Republican and Democratic parties have become closer. *Pravda* concluded that activities in establishing a vast world base network prove that the tendency associated with expansionism currently prevails in the realm of foreign policy, a tendency that is imperialism of the twentieth century. *Red Star* pointed out that the issue of forward air bases is a new factor in international relations, and strongly stated that the US base network plan will cause conflicts between British and American interests, because what the US is pursuing is not only to retain but also to expand its base network, especially in the Near East and Middle East.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n中国    China\n延安    Yan'an\n塔斯社  TASS\n莫斯科  Moscow\n真理报  Pravda\n红星报  Red Star\n惠勒  Wheeler\n海外基地  Bases Overseas\n冰岛  Iceland\n非洲  Africa\n近东  Near East\n贝纳斯  Benes\n贝文  Bevin\n巴黎  Paris\n太平洋  Pacific Ocean\n共和党  Republican Party\n民主党  Democratic Party\n范登堡  Vandenberg\n罗斯福  Roosevelt\n英国    Britain\n美国    United States\n中东  Middle East\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美外交政策呈现新趋势  企图建立世界基地网  英美两国间利益发生矛盾\n\n1946-05-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美外交政策呈现新趋势\n    企图建立世界基地网\n    英美两国间利益发生矛盾\n    【新华社延安二十二日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报与红星报，十九日均著文评论美国之扩张基地。真理报在题为《以世界基地制度，作为扩张政策的武器》论文中，指出美国许多政论家，均以“世界基地制度”为战后美国外交政策十分确定的方针和计划。惠勒《海外基地》一书，设计了美国应以基地围绕全世界的计划，并暴露了美国扩张集团明确的趋向，与他们解决战后问题的态度。真理报指出，建立美国基地网，决非这个或那个美国记者幻想的结果，而是已付诸实行的最基本方法之一。“基地网”计划，已在美国关于冰岛基地所进行的谈判中实现了，他们在非洲、近东与中国的活动，已是尽人皆知，值得注意的，是在贝纳斯与贝文在巴黎关于美国在太平洋各岛的基地进行谈判的消息，美外交政策新趋势，代表了美国主要政党——共和党与民主党——在外交政治问题立场上的重要变化。美国孤立主义的反动派，当他们提出了新计划时，他们已转到积极扩张政策的统治上去，确定其任务为建立美国在全世界的统治，这就是范登堡及其门徒的方针。人们不能不认识到罗斯福死后孤立主义领袖与共和党及民主党某些领导集团间外交政策的观点，已趋于接近。真理报结论称：在建立世界广大基地网方面的活动，证明与扩展主义相连系的倾向，目前在外交政策范围内占了上风，此种倾向为二十世纪的帝国主义。红星报指出：前进航空基地问题，是国际关系中的新因素，并力称美国基地网计划将引起美英两国利益间的冲突，因为美国追求的不仅是保留，而且是扩张其基地网，特别是在近东与中东的基地网。"

    "content": "【Dispatch from Changzhi by this newspaper】After the victory of the anti-traitor and rent reduction movement, the masses in Bo'ai, Wuzhi, Xiuwu, and other counties in northern Henan are organizing to build water conservancy projects and fight against natural disasters. The Grain Transport River in the Fourth District of Bo'ai had not been dredged for fifty years. When the Kuomintang's 40th and 27th Armies were entrenched in Bo'ai, they were unable to stop the enemy's tank attacks and decided to breach the Grain Transport River dyke, flooding Jianggou. Since then, the Grain Transport River water could not be used for irrigation in normal times, and during the rainy season, due to the narrowness of the ditch and the high riverbed, over 50,000 mu of fertile land along the riverbank was flooded, and all the crops were destroyed, resulting in a loss of over 15,000 dan of grain for the masses each year. If we also consider the 3,000 mu of farmland occupied by Jianggou, the annual loss to the masses would be over 20,000 dan. Last month, under the leadership of the democratic government, the masses of 38 villages in the district established a water conservancy committee. After eight days of hard work and the expenditure of over 30,000 labor days, they finally transformed the Grain Transport River, which had caused so much harm, into a river that benefits the people. Tens of thousands of mu of fertile land along the river will now be able to achieve a good harvest without worry. Although the people of Wuzhi and Xiuwu counties in the bordering areas are subject to all kinds of sabotage and harassment by the Kuomintang army and puppet troops, the county's democratic government has resolutely implemented the \"Qin River Dyke Repair\" resolution passed by the county council last month. The Qin River has a high riverbed and low ground. In the Shijing and Zhaoyang areas, the dykes are only two or three chi thick. During the summer floods, tens of thousands of people in the two counties will inevitably suffer from floods. Therefore, the councils of the two counties have passed a huge budget to build the river dyke. Now the county democratic government has concentrated experienced people from along the river to form a river affairs committee to carry out planning, and it is expected that it can be completed before the wheat harvest.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\nPlaces:\n博爱县   Bo'ai Xian (Bo'ai County)\n武陟县   Wuzhi Xian (Wuzhi County)\n修武县   Xiuwu Xian (Xiuwu County)\n豫北   Yubei (Northern Henan)\n长治   Changzhi\n运粮河  Yunliang He (Grain Transport River)\n蒋沟  Jianggou\n沁河  Qin He\n石敬  Shijing\n兆阳  Zhaoyang\n\nOrganizations:\n国民党  Guomindang (Kuomintang)\n民主政府  Minzhu zhengfu (Democratic Government)\n水利委员会  Shuili weiyuanhui (Water Conservancy Committee)\n县参议会  Xian canyihui (County Council)\n河务委员会  He Wu Weiyuanhui (River Affairs Committee)\n\nMilitary Units:\n四十军  Sishi Jun (40th Army)\n廿七军  Nianqi Jun (27th Army)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 翻身群众修浚运粮河  博爱五万亩地成良田\n\n1946-05-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　翻身群众修浚运粮河\n    博爱五万亩地成良田\n    【本报长治讯】豫北博爱、武陟、修武等县群众，于反奸减租胜利后，正组织起来，兴修水利，和天灾自然作斗争。博爱四区的运粮河，五十年来，未曾修浚。国民党四十军、廿七军盘踞博爱时，无法阻止敌人坦克进攻，曾决运粮河堤，灌入蒋沟，从此运粮河水，平时便无法浇地，一到雨季，因沟内窄狭，河床又高，河堤沿岸五万余亩良田，尽被水淹，田禾全被冲毁，每年群众少打粮食一万五千余石。若再将蒋沟，所占民田三千余亩计算在内，则每年群众所受损失当在两万石以上。上月该区卅八村群众在民主政府领导下，成立了水利委员会，共经八天的努力，费三万余工，终将百害之运粮河，修成造福人民的河流，沿河数万亩良田从此当可丰收无虑。边沿县区武陟、修武人民虽在国民党军队和伪军百般破坏袭扰下，该县民主政府亦坚决执行，上月县参议会通过的“沁河修堤”的决议，沁河河高地低，石敬兆阳一带，堤厚仅二、三尺，夏季河涨两县数万群众，即难免水灾。因之两县参议会通过巨大预算，兴修该河河堤，现该县民主政府，已集中全县沿河有经验人士组织河务委员会，进行策划，预计在麦收前，即可全部完成。"

The main points are as follows: 1. Establish an Indian Federation, including British India and the princely states ruled by various princes. The scope of the federation's power is limited to transportation, diplomacy, national defense, and the collection of finances from the people. 2. The federation will have executive and legislative bodies composed of representatives from British India and the princely states. In the event of major disputes between races in the parliament, a decision requires the agreement of both parties, the  Congress and the Muslim League. 3. All other powers not belonging to the federation remain with the various provinces of British India. 4. The princely states retain all powers except those ceded to the federation. 5. Provinces may freely form provincial unions. 6. Every ten years, each province may, by a majority vote of its parliament, request a reconsideration of the various clauses of the constitution. Regarding the composition of the federal constituent assembly, the plan, using the excuse that the establishment of the assembly will be delayed, advocates not holding universal adult suffrage but using the current provincial assemblies as electoral bodies. Federal deputies will be selected according to the population ratio of each province. The plan also decides not to grant the request of Indian Muslims to establish an autonomous state.

Even German, Japanese, and Italian fascists never had such arrogant open secret agents. He said: \"Who would have thought that today, when German, Japanese, and Italian fascism is defeated, the fascist germs are not dead, but have even further advanced to allow secret agents to operate openly.\" Professor Ma Xulun, in an article in the Wenhui Daily refuting the so-called \"the principles and system of visits, stating its goals\" remark by Zhang Jinzhi, director of the Inspection Department of the Police Bureau, stated: \"The 'police precinct system' is clearly a scheme to control the activities of democratic elements. How can Zhang Jinzhi quibble!\" Recently, the Kuomintang announced that it would first implement it in the Changshu district, which further exposes the Kuomintang's original intention to destroy democratic elements.\" Mr. Ma bluntly pointed out this conspiracy, saying: \"I know that there are indeed many democratic elements living in the Changshu district, and the police station naturally has records to check. So, his intention to start the trial in Changshu district is so-called 'having its own goals.'\" Zhou Jianren said: \"I am worried for the authorities and hope they will not use unreasonable methods to force good compatriots to become angry.\" The Millard's Review also pointed out that the implementation of this system will cause all Chinese and foreign personages, regardless of race, skin color, belief, or political views, to lose their freedom.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] Chongqing News: PCC representative of the Democratic League, Luo Longji, recently made a statement to reporters, denouncing the \"police officer precinct system\" about to be implemented in Shanghai, saying: He cannot see any difference between this police precinct system and the past dictatorships and rule of the German, Japanese, and Italian fascist countries over the people. Today in China, there is still such a thorough fascist thing coming out to rule the people. The police can arbitrarily run into the homes of ordinary people and use white, blue, and red documentary films to strengthen fascist rule. Standing on the position of the Chinese people and the position of the Democratic League, he expressed his firm opposition.

Now we must use the power of the entire nation to not allow this fascist thing to be realized.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] Chongqing News: The Sichuan Construction Promotion Association recently expressed its opinions to the authorities, opposing the establishment of the \"police officer precinct system,\" opposing student military training, and opposing the continued collection of land tax in kind. The association pointed out that the \"police precinct system\" is a more intensified form of secret agent rule. It also stated: The people are not robbers, let alone slaves of a conquered nation. This means of destroying the freedom of national life in the name of \"preventing petty thieves\" is an insult to all the people, and they are determined to oppose it to the death. Regarding student military training, it is believed that at the time of peace and national construction, there should no longer be such wartime measures. Regarding the collection of land tax in kind, it is tantamount to the three million conscripted young men who have not yet been demobilized, the extreme shortage of rural labor, and the Sichuan people who have suffered from drought, being cut off from life.

In a conversation with a reporter from this agency, he stated: \"The focal point of the current Chinese situation is in the Northeast. The key to the Northeast issue is an immediate ceasefire. A ceasefire in the Northeast is a prerequisite for implementing all resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference.\" Zhou continued, \"He and other Northeastern figures in Chongqing advocate the following for mediating the civil war in the Northeast: 1. The government and the CCP should immediately cease fire, temporarily maintain the status quo, and cease troop movements. 2. Establish a local joint government including all parties and Northeastern figures. 3. Reorganize government and CCP troops and local armies in accordance with the military reorganization agreement.\" Zhou also summarized his efforts since November of last year in launching an anti-civil war movement, and how he vigorously urged the participating representatives to discuss the realization of a ceasefire in the Northeast during the convening of the Political Consultative Conference. Zhou said, \"Apart from a few stubborn individuals within the Kuomintang, all were able to calmly negotiate. He had repeatedly suggested the above proposals to government representatives and CCP representatives, but unfortunately, there was no satisfactory result.\" Zhou believes that the government's insistence on the civil war policy in the Northeast is unwise and inhumane. Zhou compared the Northeast civil war, with its intermittent fighting and inconsistent urgency, to a hangman's noose being applied to his fellow villagers. He said with indignation, \"Ten years of civil war have not yielded any results. If we really continue to fight, the people of the Northeast cannot bear it.

(2) In the Jinzhong Plains area, more than 100,000 people were mobilized to dig up eggs and kill nymphs, preventing the locust plague from spreading. During the enemy and puppet regime's rule, the locust plagues in the area were severe. According to statistics from over 140 villages in Wenshui, Fenyang, and Pingyao counties, over 1.3 million mu of farmland were affected, resulting in a loss of over 600,000 shi of grain. Now, the locust disaster has been eradicated. (3) In the Jinzhong Plains area, cotton fields in Wenshui, Pingyao, Jiexiu, Fenyang, Yangqu, Qingyuan, and other counties have now exceeded pre-war levels, and seedlings have been planted. This area was originally a famous cotton-producing area in Shanxi. During the enemy occupation, cotton fields were reduced by nine-tenths. In order to restore this huge cotton production, the democratic government provided large amounts of grain and loans, and adjusted cotton fields and cotton seeds.

    "content": "[This dispatch from Changzhi] Taihang's Jiji, Xiyang, Zanhuang, and other places are implementing rent reduction through investigation in conjunction with production, with the following approaches: Xiaodian Village in Jiji uses small-scale rent reduction reasoning meetings, totaling fifteen people, first convincing the landlord Li Zuoyan, and then resolving problems individually. Tenants raised a total of eleven issues, all of which the landlord acknowledged. In Hengshan Village, Xiyang, cadres participate in mutual aid groups, using spare time from eating and farming to discover problems and conduct ideological education, resolving them in evening meetings. The resolution methods are very flexible; small problems are resolved through reasoning in small meetings, while large problems are resolved in people's schools. In Wangjiaping, Zanhuang, it was discovered during leadership of production that tenant morale was low. After in-depth investigation, more than thirty unresolved rent reduction issues were found, mostly related to mountain estates, pauper's hovels, and relatives. On the 27th of last month, taking advantage of a rainy day, a large meeting was held to denounce the local tyrant landlord Hou Xinzhang. Wang Huancheng, the first to recount his grievances, said: \"Hou Xinzhang is my uncle. I cannot escape poverty because he is oppressing me! I farmed one of his mountain estates, originally hoping that because we were relatives, the rent would be less. The first year, there was no land on the estate, so we agreed on a rent of two shi. When I had reclaimed twenty mu of land, he wanted to divide the rent, demanding three shi, so I could only get one shi. Until I had reclaimed all the land, he wouldn't let me farm it anymore. I begged from door to door, and my eldest son starved to death. Is this cruel behavior that of an uncle? He has a heart more savage than a wolf!\" Hou Xinzhang, knowing he was in the wrong, admitted to returning the rent and land seized by force. Wang Huancheng's approach of breaking through personal considerations moved many people, and they raised issues one after another. The cadres also became determined, guaranteeing thorough investigation and rent reduction without leaving any loose ends.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n太行  Taihang\n汲淇  Jiji\n昔阳  Xiyang\n赞皇  Zanhuang\n长治  Changzhi\n小店村  Xiaodian Village\n李作彦  Li Zuoyan\n横山村  Hengshan Village\n民校  People's Schools\n王家坪  Wangjiaping\n侯新彰  Hou Xinzhang\n王焕成  Wang Huancheng\n山庄  Mountain estates\n窝铺  Pauper's hovels\n石  Shi (unit of dry measure)\n亩  Mu (unit of area)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行汲淇、昔阳等县生产中贯彻查减  干部在参加领导生产中，发现问题灵活解决。\n\n1946-05-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行汲淇、昔阳等县生产中贯彻查减\n    干部在参加领导生产中，发现问题灵活解决。\n    【本报长治讯】太行汲淇、昔阳、赞皇等地，结合生产贯彻查减有以下几种作法：汲淇小店村运用小型减租说理会的形式，共十五人，先把地主李作彦说倒，然后分别解决问题，佃户共提出问题十一件，地主都承认了。昔阳横山村，干部分别参加互助组，利用吃饭种地的余暇，发现问题，并进行思想教育，晚上开会解决，解决方法很灵活，小问题召开小型会说理解决，大问题在民校解决。赞皇王家坪，从领导生产中发现佃户情绪不高，深入检查，发现未减租问题三十余件，属于山庄窝铺及亲属关系的较多。上月二十七日，利用天雨空隙，召开了斗争恶霸地主侯新彰的大会，第一个诉苦的王焕成说：“侯新彰是我的姑夫，我受穷翻不了身，就是他压的哩！我种了他的一个山庄，原想靠着亲戚，租子可少一点，头一年，庄上没地，说定两石租，等我修地修到二十亩了，他就要分租，打三石我才能分一石，直到把地都修好，就不让我种了，我沿门讨饭，把大儿子也饿死了，这难难还算姑夫吗？比狼的心还狠哩！”侯新彰自知理屈，承认退租退霸地，王焕成这种破除情面的作法感动了许多人，纷纷提出问题，干部也有了决心，保证彻底查减不留尾巴。"

Representatives of more than 10,000 businesses from fifty trade associations citywide recently issued an urgent appeal to all sectors of the country, demanding that they urgently stop the reactionary faction's disastrous and harmful behavior. Since the Small Business Association launched the anti-civil war signature campaign, more than 12,000 people have signed, including hundreds of vendors from Beijing and Tianjin, declaring three propositions: (1) Immediately stop the Kuomintang army's breach of contract offensives and illegal troop movements, withdraw from all towns and cities occupied in the Liberated Areas, and return to their original defenses. (2) Quickly resolve the Northeast issue through peaceful political consultation, to avoid the continued expansion of the civil war. (3) Protect the Three Major Agreements and promptly realize Chiang Kai-shek's four promises. At the same time, workers from more than ten factories, including Minsheng Electric Company, Zhangyuan Tobacco Company, and Guangda Oil Factory, also held emergency meetings and jointly issued similar telegrams.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n张家口   Zhangjiakou\n冀中解放区   Jizhong Liberated Area (Central Hebei Liberated Area)\n平北   Pingbei (Northern Hebei)\n冀东   Jidong (Eastern Hebei)\n新华社   Xinhua News Agency\n小商联合会   Small Business Association\n平津   Beijing and Tianjin\n东北   Northeast\n三大协定   Three Major Agreements\n蒋介石   Jiang Jieshi\n民生电业公司   Minsheng Electric Company\n张垣烟草公司   Zhangyuan Tobacco Company\n光大油厂   Guangda Oil Factory\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 张市商家万人签名反对国民党扩大内战\n\n1946-05-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　张市商家万人签名反对国民党扩大内战\n    【新华社张家口二十一日电】国民党军大规模进攻冀中解放区，并他犯平北、冀东、各地的扩大内战罪行，激起张家口各阶层爱好和平人民的普遍义愤，造成群众性的反内战运动。全市五十种行业联合会代表一万余商号，于日前向全国各界发出紧急呼吁，要求急起制止反动派这一祸国殃民的行为。小商联合会发起反内战签名运动以来，签名者已达一万二千余名，内中并有来自平津的商贩数百人，宣言中提出三项主张：（一）立即制止国民党军的违约进攻及非法调动，撤出所侵占的解放区各城镇，退回原防。（二）迅速以和平的政治协商的方式，解决东北问题，免使内战继续扩大。（三）保卫三大协定，从速实现蒋介石四项诺言。同时民生电业公司，张垣烟草公司，光大油厂等十余工厂工友，亦召开紧急会议，联合发出同样通电。"

He commented on the \"Liberation Daily\" editorial \"Refuting Chiang Kai-shek\" and the unreasonable abuse of the Kuomintang newspapers, saying: \"Our overall impression of the mutual scolding of the two sides is that the Communist Party's organ newspaper—Yan'an's \"Liberation Daily\"—refutes Chairman Chiang's method by trying its best to list factual evidence and using Chairman Chiang's own remarks as basic examples, with the purpose of persuading people with 'reason.' The Kuomintang's organ newspaper uses the opposite method of refutation. It does not refute the facts listed by the \"Liberation Daily,\" but only uses angry emotions to scold the Communist Party. Following this, Mr. Zhang first listed Chiang Kai-shek's New Year's Day address in the 34th year of the Republic of China, saying that he wanted to \"vigorously adopt public opinion and broad criticism.\" Therefore, Mr. Zhang said that Chiang Kai-shek is a \"public servant\" rather than an \"emperor,\" in order to refute the Kuomintang organ newspaper's so-called \"insulting the head of state.\" Secondly, he believes that the Kuomintang organ newspaper's scolding of our party as \"thugs\" \"inevitably gives people the feeling that their reasoning is poor and their words clumsy.\" After listing facts such as the Kunming bloodbath and the Jiaochangkou incident, Mr. Zhang said: \"Mentioning thugs and damage makes people shudder.\" Finally, Mr. Zhang said: \"Facts speak louder than eloquence, right and wrong are in people's hearts, and the people will see the suffering in their hearts.\"\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n张雪岩  Zhang Xueyan\n田家半月刊  Tianjia Half-Monthly\n联合三日刊  United Three-Day Publication\n解放日报  Liberation Daily\n驳蒋介石  Refuting Chiang Kai-shek\n蒋介石  Jiang Jieshi\n昆明血案  Kunming bloodbath\n较场口  Jiaochangkou\n延安  Yan'an\n重庆  Chongqing\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n中国共产党   Chinese Communist Party\n国民党  Kuomintang\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 张雪岩论两党言论   事实胜于漫骂  中共以理服人国民党理穷词拙\n\n1946-05-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　张雪岩论两党言论\n    事实胜于漫骂\n    中共以理服人国民党理穷词拙\n    【新华社延安二十二日电】渝讯：基督教会刊物《田家半月刊》主编张雪岩氏，四月十六日在重庆出版之《联合三日刊》上发表《论两党对骂》，副题为《主席是公仆，不是皇帝》一文，对解放日报社论《驳蒋介石》，及国民党报纸无理漫骂评称：“我们对两方的互骂，获得一个总的印象，就是共产党机关报——延安的解放日报，驳斥蒋主席的方法，是竭力列举实证，并以蒋主席自家的言论作基本证例，目的是在以“理”服人，国民党的机关报所用的反驳方法，就恰恰相反，对解放日报所列举的事实没有驳辩，只是用愤怒的情感责骂共产党。接着张氏首先列举蒋介石三十四年元旦训词，说要“力采舆论广泛批评”，所以张氏说蒋介石是“公仆”而不是“皇帝”，用以驳斥国民党机关报所谓“侮辱元首”之言。其次，他认为国民党机关报骂我党为“暴徒”，“未免使人发生理穷词拙之感”。张氏并列举昆明血案及较场口等事实后称：“提到暴徒，损害，使人不寒而栗”。最后张氏说：“事实胜雄辩，是非在人心，内心的苦，人民会看到的”。"

In Qicun Town, Pingxiang, Southern Hebei, many houses were destroyed during the enemy's rule. In Zhengjiazhuang, all 130 houses along one street were completely destroyed. After our army liberated Pingxiang, the democratic government immediately provided loans of 130,000 yuan to help the people of the whole town rebuild. Now, after a concentrated effort of sowing seeds, the people of the town have built 160 new houses from the ruins, and another 245 rooms under construction will soon be completed. In the Seventh District of Yuanchao, this area's 39 villages have also built 800 new houses. In the old liberated area of Licheng in the Taihang Mountains, thanks to the people listening to the government last year and universally planting cotton with profitable results, villages are also actively building new houses. In Langzhuang Village, with 83 households, 270 houses were destroyed during the war. Last year, 160 mu of cotton were planted, and the entire village earned 1.2 million yuan, with every household having sufficient food and clothing. Since January, 18 spacious two-story buildings and 27 tile-roofed houses have been newly built. It is now planned to continue building eight more two-story buildings, eighteen flat houses, and eighteen cave dwellings. Mafang Town in the newly liberated He Shun was extremely prosperous before the war. After the enemy occupied Mafang, the town was completely reduced to rubble, becoming an uninhabited area. After liberation last year, the democratic government immediately launched a fundraising and relief campaign throughout the district. Sixty people who had fled are now returning to the town.

According to statistics from 79 villages across the county: 166 livestock were newly purchased, most of which were bought through mutual aid partnerships. Secondly, the universal organization of people pulling plows has solved the shortage of draft power. (2) In addition to organizing the purchase of farm tools with the fruits of rent reduction and dividends from sideline production, iron and wood craftsmen and farmers are organized to exchange labor. Farm tool stations have also been specially set up in Guancun and other places to facilitate farmers' repair and purchase. (3) In the eastern mountain areas, large-scale organization of composting fertilizer is carried out. The Guxian Village in the Second District composted more than 30,000 dan of fertilizer. (4) Regarding the seed and spring famine problem, in addition to allocating grain and funds for relief, the government launched a widespread mutual aid and mutual borrowing movement. Due to disaster and famine in the East Street of Handian Town in the Third District, the West Street lent 30 shi of grain. Bao Village lent 10 shi of seeds to Ci Village.

    "content": "Wen Aixiang and Yang Laofang Invent New Pulley\n    [Yongnian News] Wen Aixiang and Yang Laofang from Dongjiangwu Village have successfully invented a new pulley. When they first started researching, many people criticized them for fooling around, but they were not discouraged and continued to study diligently. They knew that the democratic government would reward inventions and improvements to farm tools, so they made a model and sent it to the government for inspection. Our government provided them with spiritual encouragement and loan support, which gave them even greater confidence. At the end of the year, they researched and trial-produced it. After many failures and modifications, they have now successfully created it. In order to promote agricultural tool improvement, our government awarded them 100 catties of millet, which was praised by the masses. The advantages of the new pulley are: 1. For the same water depth, the old pulley needs to be cranked twelve and a half times for the water to come up, while the new pulley only needs to be cranked three and a half times; because the pulley head is larger. 2. Because the new pulley hangs two buckets (the old one has one), when one goes up, the other goes down, and the descending empty bucket acts as a weight; after the water is cranked up, it can automatically pour out without using hands; furthermore, because of the use of shaft bowls and ball bearings, it is light and labor-saving, and can be used by women and children. 3. In terms of efficiency, one new pulley can replace six old ones, equivalent to one waterwheel, but the price is much cheaper than a waterwheel, and it does not require livestock to pull it.

They immediately returned to their villages and gathered separately to carry out liquidation. By the end of the month, part of the tenancy arbitration problem had been resolved. Some tenancy accounts, however, were not settled because landlords, failing to understand the greater good, refused to clear various extra exploitations such as advance borrowing of wheat and \"pseudo-fees\" according to the law. Public sentiment was indignant, and they demanded that the government mediate. At the same time, the landlords also requested the government to handle it quickly. Therefore, on April 4th, under the joint auspices of the Huai'an County Government, the Municipal Government, and the Shitang District Office, a tenant-landlord arbitration conference was convened. Below is a communication from the conference. From this, we can see the cruelty of landlords' exploitation of tenants, while the tenants are broad-minded.\n     ——Editor\n    April 4th left a profound impression on the people of Shitang District, Huai'an. They will never forget such a scene: in the auditorium of the Huai'an County Government, sat over sixty neatly dressed owners on one side, and over two hundred tenant farmer representatives dressed in rough clothes on the other. Both sides were stating their opinions, arguing until their faces turned red. This was the rent reduction arbitration conference in Shitang District, Huai'an.\n    Before the meeting, the tenant and landlord sides had been brewing, and the government had also conducted detailed investigations and research. Therefore, both parties' representatives arrived complete. At 1:00 PM, Mayor Yin of Huaicheng announced the opening of the meeting, saying: Since the launch of the rent reduction and account settlement in Shitang District, it has been difficult for the landlord and tenant sides to resolve many issues at once; the government has simultaneously received application letters from both the owners and the tenant farmers, requesting mediation of the disputes between the two sides, so this meeting is convened.\n    Then, both the landlord and tenant sides actively spoke. Lin Xiuwu, Zhao Lanting, Qin Shiliang, and others on the owner's side narrated the situation of this account settlement and inquired about the settlement standards. On the tenant side, the speaker was Wang Shugong. He spoke of the tenant's hardships and demanded the settlement of more than ten kinds of extra exploitations such as \"rice watching fees.\" After the landlord and tenant spoke in succession, they entered arbitration. The first was to resolve the dispute between the owner Tang Renqian and the tenant farmers (Tang had one hundred and twenty-six mu of land in Jiaochang Township, and he himself was in Shanghai and had not returned, so the steward Wang Shuren represented him). Tenant representative Wang Shugong narrated the detailed accounts of various exploitations according to the bill. The first item, \"pseudo-fees,\" caused a dispute. The owner's representative believed that there were fees in the countryside and fees in the streets, so the tenants should bear them. Tenant Wang Shugong was not convinced when he heard this. He immediately stood up and said loudly, \"Pseudo-fees\" are apportioned to the fields, and we pay rent for planting your land. If you yourself do not pay \"pseudo-fees\" for your own fields, do you still want to push them on me!\" This immediately aroused a burst of applause from the tenants... The two sides argued endlessly. An owner believed that the pseudo-fees could be borne by both parties according to \"heavenly principles, national law, and human sentiment.\" Tenant representative Wang Shugong said: \"One shi of rice (6.6 mu) can harvest six shi of wheat every year. Fifteen shi of rice total twenty-one shi. After deducting ten shi of regular rent for you, various labor and fertilizer costs six dan and four dou, and deducting spring repair, dung digging, \"meals,\" \"small rent,\" and \"estate watching\" for more than three shi, and then paying \"pseudo-fees\" of four shi, totaling twenty-three shi and four dou, we still have to pay backwards for a year of hard work! It really forces me to be so miserable!! Without food or clothing, I still have to go out to sell my labor and flee famine everywhere!\" He recalled the past difficult years, aroused anger, and veins appeared on his face. He said loudly: \"What are 'heavenly principles,' 'national law,' and 'human sentiment'!\" His words aroused sympathetic applause from the tenants again. However, the tenants are ultimately aware of the big picture and are unwilling to affect the harmony between the landlord and the tenant due to the dispute over the \"pseudo-fee\" issue. After a period of silence, a tenant surnamed Gao took the lead in making concessions. The \"pseudo-fees\" are paid according to the amount of benefit of the landlord and tenant. More is paid for more benefits and less for less benefits. As long as the owner knows the suffering we have suffered in the past and no longer layerly exploits us, we can forgive them and make concessions. At this point, the opinions of both sides have gradually approached. County Chief Sun proposed \"According to heavenly principles and national law, the pseudo-fees should be borne by the owners, but in order to take care of the landlords' lives, the pseudo-fees can be shared by the landlord and tenant in a ratio of four to six, with the tenant paying four and the landlord paying six, and the specific implementation should be based on the economic situation of the owner.\" The owners all expressed their agreement, and the tenants shouted slogans: \"Support County Chief Sun's opinion!\"\n    After the \"pseudo-fee\" issue was resolved, the account settlement was carried out. Tenant representative Wang Shugong proposed: \"We have twenty-four tenants in Shitang District, planting 161 mu of land for owner Tang Renqian's family. Since the devils came in the 28th year (1939), until the liberation of Huai'an City last year (1945), we have paid a total of 663 shi and two dou of 'pseudo-fees', 'phantom fields' (the area of the fields rented from the boss is less than the mu, becoming a phantom field with real rent), 'meals' (the person in charge goes to the countryside to collect rent, and must be entertained with wine and meat), 'small rent' (the expenses of the person in charge and servants in the landlord's house), 'rice seed watching fees' (when the person in charge goes to the countryside to watch the rice harvest, the tenants have to give money), 'watching the black estate', etc., totaling 1,281 shi, nine dou, and five sheng.\" After speaking, he handed the detailed bill to the chairman for review. The chairman took the bill and handed it to Wang Shuren, the steward representative of the Tang family, for review, but Wang Shuren repeatedly said that he didn't know and didn't understand even before looking at the bill. The tenant representatives immediately questioned him, some said: \"If you don't understand, how do you collect rent? You'll know if you miss a bundle of rent!\" Many people were reasoning and persuading. Finally, Wang Shuren had no choice but to admit, he said: \"Only the wheat rent is wrong, the rest of the accounts are correct.\" Both sides agreed to deduct it, and there are still 1,263 shi, five dou, and five sheng remaining. At this time, the tenants voluntarily made concessions again. A representative surnamed Li said: \"Today, all kinds of exploitations are brought up to let the boss know the suffering we have suffered in the past, how we ended up being poor and unable to get ahead. Now we automatically make concessions and only count five accounts: 1. 'Advance wheat borrowing'; 2. 'Pseudo-fees'; 3. 'Car repairs'; 4. (telegraph code unclear); 5. 'Ditch digging and dike building'.\" As soon as he finished speaking, both the landlord and tenant sides applauded warmly, so owner Tang Renqian immediately settled the accounts according to this standard. The owners saw that the tenants made such concessions and expressed their gratitude.\n    The meeting was coming to a close in the evening. County Chief Sun then took the floor and explained that the tenants worked hard for a year and could not even fill their stomachs. Rent reduction is completely in line with \"heavenly principles,\" \"national law,\" and \"human sentiment.\" He also cited many examples of exploitation. At this time, Vice Chairman Liu of the Border Region Government also took the floor. He first explained that today is a unity meeting between owners and tenants. He hoped that people would not listen to rumors spread by bad people in the future. The Communist Party is to ensure that both the rich and the poor have food to eat, everyone has clothes to wear, and everyone has a good life. We advocate reasoning. If you have reason, you can go anywhere in the world, and without reason, you cannot move an inch. Reasoning should be done in a democratic way. The tenants should speak, and the owners should also speak, to clarify the reasoning. Both owners and tenants listened quietly, and his voice was repeatedly drowned out by warm applause. The meeting ended at dusk, and this first-of-its-kind owner-tenant unity meeting in Huai'an City came to a successful conclusion.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n石塘区    Shitang District\n淮安市    Huai'an City\n淮安    Huai'an\n新华社    Xinhua News Agency\n教场乡    Jiaochang Township\n上海    Shanghai\n尹市长    Mayor Yin\n林秀五    Lin Xiuwu\n赵兰亭    Zhao Lanting\n秦士良    Qin Shiliang\n王树功    Wang Shugong\n汤仞千    Tang Renqian\n王树仁    Wang Shuren\n孙县长    County Chief Sun\n刘副主席  Vice Chairman Liu\n边府      Border Region Government\nHuaicheng   淮城\n邓小平  Deng Xiaoping\n外交部  Foreign Ministry\n共产党  Communist Party\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 石塘区的主佃仲裁会议\n新华社淮安通讯\n1946-05-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　石塘区的主佃仲裁会议\n    新华社淮安通讯\n    三月二十日，淮安市石塘区七个街四千群众，进城向地主算账，怒倒石碑后，（见本报五月二十日载——编者）立即返乡，分别集合进行清算，截至月底，一部租佃仲裁问题，已获解决，部分租佃账目，因地主不明大义，对各种额外剥削如预借麦、伪费等，不肯按法清算，群情愤慨，要求政府调处，同时地主也要求政府迅速处理，于是在四月四日，由淮安县府、市府、石塘区署共同主持下召开了主佃仲裁会议，下面即是该会议的通讯，从这里我们可以看出地主剥削佃户的残酷，而佃户却是宽大为怀。\n     ——编者\n    四月四日这一天给予淮安石塘区人民的印象太深刻了，他们永远不会忘记这样一个场面：在淮安县政府大礼堂内，一边坐着六十余位衣冠楚楚的业主，另一边坐着二百多位穿戴得很粗陋的佃农代表，他们双方都在说明自己的意见，以致争论得面红耳赤。这就是淮安石塘区的减租仲裁会议。\n    在会议前曾经过主佃双方的酝酿，政府也作了详尽的调查研究，因此双方代表到得很齐全，下午一时即由淮城尹市长宣布开会，他说：石塘区发动减租算账以后，主佃双方一时难能解决很多问题；政府同时接到业主及佃户双方申请书，请求调解双方纠纷，因此召开这个会议。\n    接着主佃双方踊跃发言，业主方面林秀五、赵兰亭、秦士良等，有的叙述此次算账情形，有的询问算账标准，佃户方面，发言者是王树功、他说出佃户苦处，要求清算“看稻费”等十余种额外剥削。主佃相继发言后，即进入仲裁，首先是解决业主汤仞千与佃户的纠纷（汤有一百二十六亩地在教场乡，本人在上海未归，由庄头王树仁为代表）。由佃户代表王树功按照账单叙述各项被剥削的细账。第一项“伪费”即发生争执，业主代表认为乡下有费，街上也有费，因此应由佃户负担，佃户王树功听着不服气，他立即站起来高声说，“伪费”是田亩摊派的，而我们种你地是出了租的，你自己的田不出“伪费”，难道还要朝我身上推！当即激起佃户们的一阵掌声，……双方争持不下，有个业主认为可以根据“天理、国法、人情”把伪费由双方负担，佃户代表王树功说：“一石稻（六亩六分）每年可收六石小麦，十五石稻共二十一石，除去给你们十石正租，各种人工、粪水要六担四斗，又扣去春修挑粪挖圩，“供饭”、‘小租’、‘看庄’等三石多，再要出“伪费”四石，共二十三石四斗，我们一年辛苦还要倒贴，真逼得我好苦啊！！没吃没穿，还要出去卖苦力，到处逃荒”！他想起了过去苦难的岁月，激起了愤怒，脸上泛出条条的筋脉，大声说：“什么是‘天理’，‘国法’，‘人情’呵”！他的话又激起了佃户们同情的掌声。但是佃户们终究是明白大义的，不愿因为“伪费”问题的争执而影响主佃之间的和睦，经过一度沉寂后，一个姓高的佃户，首先表示让步，“伪费”照主佃得益多少来出，得多出多，得少出少，只要主人知道我们过去受的苦，不再层层的剥削我们，我们可原谅他们，可以让步，至此双方意见已渐接近，孙县长就提出“按照天理国法，伪费应由业主负担，但为照顾地主生活，伪费可由主佃双方四六分担，佃四主六，还要依据业主的经济情况，具体执行”。业主都表示同意，佃户并高呼口号：“拥护孙县长的意见”！\n    “伪费”问题解决后，即进行算账，佃户代表王树功提出：“我们石塘区有二十四家佃户，种业主汤仞千家地一百六十一亩，自二十八年鬼子来起，到去年解放淮城的七年中，我们共出‘伪费’六百六十三石二斗，‘虚田’（租老板的田不足亩数，成为虚田实租），‘供饭’（管事下乡收租，必须酒肉款待），‘小租’（地主家管事和仆役开支），‘稻种看稻费’（管事下乡看稻收成时，佃户要送钱），‘看黑庄’等，总共出费一千二百八十一石九斗五升。”说罢就把详尽的账单递给主席审查，主席接过账单来，交给汤家庄头代表王树仁查看，但王树仁接过账单还未过目就连声说不知不懂，佃户代表立即群起质问，有的说：“你不懂怎来催租的，少把一捆租，你就知道”？好多人都在说理，都在规劝，最后王树仁终于不得不承认，他说：“只有麦租了，余的账都不错。”双方同意扣除，尚有一千二百六十三石五斗五升，这时佃户又自愿再作让步，一个姓李的代表说：“今天各种剥削都提出来，是要老板知道我们过去受的苦，我们是怎样弄得穷不出头的，现在我们自动让步，只算五笔账，一、‘预借麦’；二、‘伪费’；三、‘修车’；四、（电码不明）五、‘挖沟挖圩’。”刚一说完，主佃双方均热烈鼓掌，于是业主汤仞千立即按此标准结算。业主见佃户如此让步，表示非常感谢。\n    会议至此，已近傍晚，仲裁即告结束，孙县长即起讲话，他说明佃户苦活一年，不能一饱，减租是完全合乎“天理”“国法”“人情”的。他又举了很多被剥削的例子。这时边府刘副主席也继起讲话，他首先说明今天是业佃团结会议，他希望以后不要听坏人造谣，共产党是使穷富都有饭吃，大家有衣穿，大家日子过得好，我们提倡讲理，有理走遍天下，无理寸步难行。讲理要采取民主方式，佃户要说业主也要说，把理讲清楚。业佃双方都静静的倾听着，他的话声屡为热烈的掌声所淹没。会至薄暮，这个在淮安城首创的业佃团结会议，就告胜利结束了。"

All were repelled by the stationed troops. The Wang Jimei troops, a puppet army from Zaozhuang, continued to fire at the Eighth Route Army's stationed area, firing over a hundred shells each day. The 19th Army Group of the Kuomintang in Lincheng has been shelling and launching sneak attacks on our army's stationed area in Jiulongshan and Dianzi West since the end of last month. On the Jiaodong front, the 166th Division of the Kuomintang Army's 8th Army and the Ge Tianming troops, a puppet army stationed in Jimo City, dispatched over seven hundred soldiers on the 15th and 16th to attack the Guanzhuang and Wuqishan areas northeast of the city, and were repelled by the stationed troops.\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhuadian, 22nd dispatch】 The Xuanhuadian 32nd Executive Group, heading to the south of Pi (Huangpi) and An (Huang'an), departed on the 16th and spent three days investigating the Kuomintang army's attacks on the Central Plains Military Region's stationed troops in the areas of Dacheng Tan, Shizishu Dian, Chenger Gang, Hongmao Zhai, and Zhan Dian. After the investigation, the group returned to Xuanhuadian at 4:00 PM on the 19th. Kuomintang representative Chen Qian had already returned to Han from Hekou. Deputy Commander Wang visited the group's representatives on the same day, expressing his condolences for their hard work in recent days, and hoped that the 32nd Executive Group could effectively implement mediation in accordance with the Hankou Agreement and stop the Kuomintang army's attacks.\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 21st dispatch】 After the Kuomintang army, with heavy losses, invaded the old city of Benxi on the 3rd of this month, it immediately dispatched planes to continuously bomb the peaceful residents at each station along the An-Shen Railway. At 10:00 AM on the 4th, a Kuomintang plane flew to Qiaotou Station (25 li south of Benxi) and, after strafing at low altitude, dropped multiple bombs. Qiaotou was originally a prosperous town, but after this bombing, all the houses in the city were reduced to rubble, and all the people's assets were destroyed. At 2:00 PM on the 5th, a Kuomintang plane bombed Caohekou again (120 li south of Benxi), killing more than ten peaceful residents and dropping a large number of incendiary bombs. Just as the south wind was blowing strongly, the fire became more intense. The entire garrison was dispatched to rescue the victims, and the fire was extinguished after six hours. Two-thirds of the houses in the entire village were burned down, and the streets and alleys were filled with cries. Other stations such as Nanfen, Matang, and Lianshangguan (all on the An-Shen Road) were also bombed, and the people's losses cannot be calculated.

    "content": "The Suwan Democratic Government Organizes Production and Relief\n    Millions of Disaster Victims Overcome Famine\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 23rd] The military and civilians of the Third (Huainan) and Sixth (Huaihai) Sub-districts of the Suwan Liberated Area have overcome the worst famine in forty years, and millions of starving disaster victims have survived. Since last year, the Suwan Border Region has suffered from drought from spring to summer, followed by floods in July, and locust plagues in July and August. Disaster victims account for two-thirds of the total population of the region. The disaster relief movement in the Third Sub-district was carried out from two aspects: organizing disaster victims for production and conducting social relief. In organizing disaster victims for production, the principle of \"relying on the mountains for sustenance and relying on the water for sustenance\" was implemented, using methods such as chopping firewood, cutting grass, dredging ponds, catching locusts, digging water chestnuts, transporting salt, spinning yarn, and digging lotus roots. According to statistics from Gaobao (newly established county) for the past winter and spring, a total of more than 6,000 households and more than 16,000 people were organized to participate in production, earning more than 120,000 yuan (all in Central China currency, with one yuan equivalent to 30 legal currency). In organizing production, cadres and labor heroes took the lead. The head of Liuqiao District in Xuyi personally went to Sanguan Township to dredge ponds, and the mutual aid group of labor hero Zhang Xingdao in Gaobao saved more than 40 shi of food by eating bean cakes. In addition, the masses were organized to dredge ponds in exchange for work, and more than 10 shi of relief grain were distributed, not only solving the food problem for the disaster victims in this group, but also having surplus grain to help the disaster victims in the township. In terms of social relief, the government distributed more than 14,000 jin of public relief grain and 300,000 dan of bean cakes. More than 28,000 dan of rice were accumulated through work-for-relief. 500 dan of cotton were lent out. 1 million yuan of disaster relief bonds were issued. And 2,800 dan of miscellaneous grains were distributed to disaster victims who dug locusts. In the Sixth Sub-district, five counties including Huaiyin, Lianshui, Shuyang, Guanyun, and Suqian, gained 1.2 million yuan, more than 960,000 jin of grain, more than 430,000 mu of land, 47,000 yuan of righteous relief, and more than 950,000 jin of grain through punishing traitors. Mutual assistance between the rich and the poor, with incomplete statistics from Sishu (newly established county) and Shuyang alone, amounted to 150,000 yuan and 115,000 jin of grain. Various sideline productions, disaster victims in only three counties of Shuyang, Guanyun, and Donghai, obtained 300,000 yuan and 215,000 jin of grain. All government agencies saved a total of 500,000 jin of grain. The Commissioner's Office used work-for-relief to demolish the five rivers and six dams, totaling more than 87,000 cubic meters, and blocked 31 breaches in various trunk rivers, totaling about 160,000 cubic meters, repaired the Wan Gong River and the Hanyang River, totaling about 1.19 million cubic meters, the Huaiyin Min Dai River 2,000 cubic meters, the Xiajia Lake 63,000 cubic meters, the Subei County more than 16,000 cubic meters, the Xiayankou 69,000 cubic meters, and the Lianshui Gongxing River more than 12,000 cubic meters. When the Shuyang Daxin River was completed, the Commissioner's Office allocated 2 million jin of grain. Each county allocated more than 1.7 million jin of grain. Now green beans are on the market, and early wheat is expected to be harvested early. 300,000 disaster victims in the Third Sub-district and 600,000 in the Sixth Sub-district who ran out of food in the spring have overcome the difficult famine.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n苏皖民主政府    Suwan Minzhu Zhengfu (Suwan Democratic Government)\n新华社    Xinhua She (Xinhua News Agency)\n淮阴    Huaiyin\n淮南    Huainan\n淮海    Huaihai\n苏皖边区    Suwan Bianqu (Suwan Border Region)\n高宝    Gaobao\n盱眙    Xuyi\n柳桥区    Liuqiao Qu (Liuqiao District)\n三官乡    Sanguan Xiang (Sanguan Township)\n张性道    Zhang Xingdao\n泗沭    Sishu\n沭阳    Shuyang\n灌云    Guanyun\n宿迁    Suqian\n东海    Donghai\n五河六坝    Wu He Liu Ba (Five Rivers and Six Dams)\n万公河    Wan Gong He (Wan Gong River)\n涵养河    Hanyang He (Hanyang River)\n民代河    Min Dai He\n夏家湖    Xiajia Hu (Xiajia Lake)\n宿北县    Subei Xian (Subei County)\n下县口    Xiayan Kou\n公兴河    Gongxing He\n打新河    Da Xin He\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏皖民主政府组织生产救济  百万灾民渡过灾荒\n\n1946-05-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏皖民主政府组织生产救济\n    百万灾民渡过灾荒\n    【新华社淮阴二十三日电】苏皖解放区三分区（淮南）、六分区（淮海）军民，已战胜四十年来未有的大灾荒，百万断炊灾民，已渡过灾荒。按苏皖边区自去年由春入夏以来遭旱灾，到七月间又遭水灾，七八月间又遭蝗灾，灾民占全区人口三分之二。三分区救灾运动，是从组织灾民生产与进行社会救济两方面进行的，在组织灾民生产中，根据“靠山吃山靠水吃水”的原则，施行砍柴、割草、挑塘、捉蝗、挖荸荠、运盐、纺纱、挖藕等办法。据高宝（新设县）去冬今春两月统计：共组织灾民六千余户，一万六千余人参加生产，得利十二万余元（以下均华中币，按该币一元合法币三十元）。在组织生产中，干部与劳英都起带头作用，盱眙柳桥区长亲到三官乡挑塘，高宝劳动英雄张性道互助组，吃豆饼即节省食粮四十多石。又以工代赈，组织群众挑塘，发出救济粮十多石，不但解决本组灾民吃粮，且有余粮救济本乡灾民。在进行社会救济方面，政府发放救灾公粮一万四千余斤，豆饼三十万担。以工代赈积稻二万八千多担。贷放棉花五百担。发行救灾公债百万元。并以二千八百担杂粮发给挖蝗灾民。在六分区方面，淮阴、涟水、沭阳、灌云、宿迁五县，以惩奸中得益一百二十万元，粮食九十六万多斤、土地四十三万多亩、义赈四万七千元、粮食九十五万多斤。贫富互助，仅泗沭（新设县）、沭阳两县不完全统计，即有十五万元，粮食十一万五千斤。各种副业生产，仅沭阳、灌云、东海三县灾民，即得三十万元，粮二十一万五千斤。各机关节约粮共五十万斤，专署以工代赈，拆除五河六坝，计八万七千余公方，堵塞各干河决口三十一处，共约十六万公方，修竣万公、涵养两河，共约一百一十九万公方，淮阴民代河二千公方，夏家湖六万三千公方，宿北县一万陆千多公方，下县口陆万九千公方，涟水公兴河一万二千多公方，修竣沭阳打新河时，专署即拨粮二百万斤。各县拨粮一百七十多万斤，现青豆登场，早麦早收有望。三分区三十万及六分区六十万春天断炊的灾民，已渡过了艰苦的灾荒。"

The Social Education Center now has a collection of over 15,000 books, as well as various newspapers, magazines, and books from various liberated areas. Readers are constantly crowding in from morning till night; the Yan'an *Liberation Daily* is especially popular among readers. Many instruments and specimens are also quite eye-catching. The Xinhua Stadium is under construction, and literacy classes for both men and women have been established in various streets. In West Street alone, there are three literacy classes for women. East Main Street has a newspaper reading group, which was jointly established by the poor and peddlers. They used grain acquired through struggle to subscribe to several newspapers, which are placed in the cooperative for regular reading. At every intersection in the city, there is a blackboard newspaper, written by the citizens of Heze themselves. It continuously carries news of current events and information related to current work. When the public trial of the traitor Sun Huajian was held, the board was written with vivid phrases such as \"Go! Go! Go avenge!\"! The blackboard is surrounded by people, and the baskets of the peddlers are often crushed. There are currently eight elementary schools in Heze City, each with an attached adult class specifically for educating poor farmers and peddlers. Many peddlers in Heze City have words pasted on their baskets. One peddler selling fried dough sticks pasted characters such as \"Chairman Mao\" and \"fried dough sticks\" on his basket to learn literacy. They have also organized Yangge teams, and theatrical troupes such as Minyou and Dazhong, and are constantly performing plays that suit the tone of the citizens.\n    [Our Newspaper, Changzhi News] The cultural and intellectual circles of Jiaozuo City established the Jiaozuo City Federation of Literary and Art Circles on the 8th of this month, in order to invigorate the city's cultural and recreational life and organize research on academic and current affairs.

    "content": "Moscow Radio Commentator Reveals\n    Chiang Kai-shek Preserved Japanese Troops to Expand Civil War\n    Northeast Democratic Allied Army Indignant that American Weapons Help the Kuomintang Massacre the Chinese People\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] Moscow Radio today broadcast Masinu's commentary on the Chinese situation, stating: In China, Japanese troops have still not been punished. After announcing their surrender last year, Japanese troops continued to actively engage in military operations. Admiral Nimitz and the British Southeast Asia Headquarters both stated that the war was still continuing. However, on August 11th, Chiang Kai-shek, disregarding the above-mentioned facts, ordered the Eighteenth Group Army, i.e., the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and all anti-Japanese guerrilla forces, to cease military operations. Four days later, the Kuomintang reiterated the disarming of Japanese troops, but in reality, they were undermining the liberated areas. On September 3rd, He Yingqin sent a representative to deliver an official note from the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese forces in China, Okamura, which stated: (1) Before the Kuomintang forces designated by Chiang Kai-shek and He Yingqin arrive, Japanese troops must not surrender to any \"illegal armed forces\" and should carry out effective defense, responsible for maintaining order. The so-called \"illegal armed forces\" here are the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which the National Government had formally recognized and resolutely advocated disarming the Japanese troops. (2) Japanese troops will remain in place and await orders. In He Yingqin's order, regarding special precautions, it was also stated that before the Chiang and He troops arrive, the Japanese troops must be responsible for recapturing and returning to the Kuomintang troops any locations lost by the Japanese troops. This order from Chiang and He supported the Japanese troops in actively resisting the Eighteenth Group Army and the New Fourth Army. The Eighteenth Group Army and the New Fourth Army, according to Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order, turned to offensive operations in Central and North China in order to liberate their compatriots from Japanese oppression more quickly and to assist the Allied countries of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States in defeating Japan in the shortest possible time. However, Chiang Kai-shek and He Yingqin not only did not disarm the Japanese troops, but ordered the Japanese troops to actively help the puppet troops such as Men Zhizhong to attack the Communist army in the liberated areas. Therefore, this order from Chiang and He made the Japanese troops in China not in the position of defeated troops after Japan's unconditional surrender, but in the position of allied troops. Chinese social figures believe that this order is a conspiracy to help the Chinese reactionaries and the Japanese warlords in China to possibly preserve Japanese military strength, undermine the KMT-CPC negotiations, and provoke the Chinese civil war. In reality, this order from Chiang and He has been used by Japanese and puppet troops to launch attacks on the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. In recent months, the Kuomintang military authorities have not only failed to disarm the Japanese troops, but have also used the Japanese and puppet troops to expand the Chinese civil war. Until now, Japanese combat troops continue to fight alongside other troops, attacking the Communist army and the liberated areas. Not only in Yan Xishan's subordinates, but also in other Kuomintang troops in North China, there are Japanese troops. In the Kuomintang's 87th Division, 120 Japanese troops are participating in the fighting. The U.S. military authorities in China are also using the Japanese armed forces on a large scale. Under the pretext of sending Japanese troops back to their country, they ordered the Japanese troops to perform sentry duties. Japanese officers and soldiers and generals who returned from China told their colleagues, friends, and the people at home about this situation, which encouraged the active activities of Japanese reactionaries and warlords. After Japan signed the instrument of surrender, the Japanese reactionaries and warlords not only did not become dejected, but also increasingly strengthened their rampant activities.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] Moscow Radio: American Weapons Help the Kuomintang Massacre the Chinese People. TASS, Vladivostok, May 18th dispatch: A special correspondent for Pravda learned that since the Red Army withdrew from Manchuria, fierce fighting has broken out between the Kuomintang army and the Northeast Democratic Allied Army. According to reliable sources, some of the Kuomintang troops and American weapons have been captured by the Democratic Allied Army. This fact has aroused extreme indignation among the Democratic Allied Army.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国  China\n蒋介石  Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-shek)\n日本  Japan\n东北民主联军  Northeast Democratic Allied Army\n国民党  Kuomintang\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n延安  Yan'an\n莫斯科  Moscow\n马西努  Masinu\n尼米兹  Nimitz\n何应钦  He Yingqin\n冈村  Okamura\n第十八集团军  The Eighteenth Group Army\n八路军  Eighth Route Army\n新四军  New Fourth Army\n朱总司令  Commander-in-Chief Zhu\n华中  Central China\n华北  North China\n门致中  Men Zhizhong\n伪军  Puppet troops\n阎锡山  Yan Xishan\n满洲  Manchuria\n国民党八十七师 Kuomintang 87th Division\n海参威  Vladivostok\n真理报  Pravda\n红军  Red Army\n美国  United States\n东南亚总部  Southeast Asia Headquarters\n塔斯社  TASS\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 莫斯科广播评论员揭露  蒋介石保存日军扩展内战  东北民主联军愤慨美国武器帮助国民党屠杀中国人民\n\n1946-05-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　莫斯科广播评论员揭露\n    蒋介石保存日军扩展内战\n    东北民主联军愤慨美国武器帮助国民党屠杀中国人民\n    【新华社延安二十三日电】莫斯科今日广播马西努评中国局势称：在中国，日军仍没有得到惩办，去年宣布投降之后，日军仍积极进行军事行动。尼米兹海军上将与英军东南亚总部，都曾声称战争仍在继续中。然而八月十一日蒋介石不顾上述实际情况，即下令第十八集团军即八路军、新四军及一切抗日游击部队停止军事行动，过了四天之后，国民党重声明解除日军武装，实际却来瓦解各解放区。九月三日，何应钦派代表转交驻华日军总司令冈村通牒一纸，提出：（一）由蒋介石、何应钦所指派的国民党军未到达前，日军不得向任何“非法武装部队缴械，并应作有效的防卫，负责维持秩序”。这里所谓“非法武装部队”即是国民政府曾正式承认，而且坚决主张解除日军武装的八路军与新四军。（二）日军暂留原地，静候命令。在何应钦命令中，关于特别注意事项，并提出在蒋何军队到达以前，日军失去的地点，必须由日军负责夺回交还国民党军队。蒋何这一命令，支持了日军积极反抗十八集团军与新四军，十八集团军与新四军则按照朱总司令的命令，在华中、华北转为进攻，以便更快地将自己的同胞从日军压迫下解放出来，并协助苏英美各盟国于最短期间内击溃日本。而蒋介石与何应钦不但不去解除日军武装，却令日军积极帮助门致中等伪军，向解放区中共军进攻。所以蒋何这一命令，使在中国的日军在日本无条件投降后，不是处在战败军的地位，而是处在盟军的地位。中国社会人士认为这一命令，是帮助中国的反动派与在华日本军阀的阴谋可能保存日军兵力，破坏国共谈判，挑拨中国内战，实际上蒋何这一命令，已被日伪军利用实行进攻八路军与新四军。最近几月，国民党军事当局不仅未解除日军武装，而且利用日伪军来扩展中国的内战。直到现在，日本的战斗部队还是继续与其他部队共同作战，向中共军与解放区进攻。不仅是阎锡山部下，而且华北其他国民党军队中，都编有日军部队，现时在满洲展开进攻的国民党军内，同样有日本军队。在国民党八十七师内，即有一二零名日军参加作战。驻华美军当局也大规模利用日本武装部队，他们以派遣日军回国的名义，命日军执行哨兵的职务，从中国回国的日本官兵与将军，都把这种情形告诉自己的同僚、友人与国内人民，这便鼓励了日本反动派与军阀的积极活动。日本签订降书之后，日本反动派与军阀非但没有垂头丧气，而且日益加强其猖狂活动。\n    【新华社延安二十三日电】莫斯科今日广播：美国武器帮助国民党屠杀中国人民。塔斯社海参威五月十八日电：真理报特派记者获悉，自红军自满洲撤退之后，国民党军队与东北民主联军之间，发生了激烈战斗。据可靠消息，国民党军队与美国武器已有一部分被民主联军俘获，这一事实，在民主联军中引起极端愤慨的情绪。"

    "content": "Handan Municipal Government Investigates and Returns Enemy-Occupied Land to the Masses\n    Peasants Become Masters of Their Own Land, Production Enthusiasm Soars\n    [Special Dispatch from This City] The enemy's \"North China Cotton Improvement Society\" and the puppet \"Daoyin Office\" once forcibly bought more than 24 *qing* of land from the people at low prices in Liulinqiao, Xiaotunzi, Nanxinzhuang, Xinan zhuang and other villages around Handan, establishing four agricultural farms: Agricultural Experimental Farm, Cotton Industry School, Taikang Farm, and Wheat Garden Seed Nursery, causing the vast number of peasants who lost their land to suffer from hunger and cold and unable to live. After our liberation of Handan, many landless poor peasants immediately requested the municipal government to return the land forcibly bought by the enemy and puppets. The democratic government immediately sent special personnel to Liulinqiao and Xiaotunzi farms to conduct investigations, understand the masses' opinions on the farm land, and held meetings with village cadres to discuss and decide that, in addition to preserving the farm's public buildings and experimental sites, all land forcibly bought from middle and poor peasants would be returned to provide relief. 1,416 *mu* of the above land has already been returned before spring plowing. These peasants, who were plundered of their land by the enemy in the past, were like serfs, tilling a season of wheat for the enemy without compensation, and after the wheat harvest, they planted a season of autumn grain themselves, and still had to pay rent to the enemy. Now they have become masters of their own land again, and their production enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. They are overjoyed and preparing to harvest wheat and sow autumn crops.\n    [Another Dispatch] The municipal government is actively investigating and handling the issue of land and real estate in various urban districts of Chengguan that were invaded and occupied by the enemy and puppets during the war. In recent days, the Municipal Affairs Section, in coordination with cadres from the Nanguan District, has been investigating places such as the former puppet county cooperative warehouse and the public stadiums of the First and Second Commercial Centers. The enemy forcibly bought and plundered land from the masses at low prices to build warehouses. In order to protect the land rights and property rights of the masses, our democratic government, after investigation, specially convened a meeting of the landowners in the area to discuss solutions. Through democratic discussions among the masses, everyone agreed to sell the land occupied by the warehouse (now the参议会, [Presumably the local People's Consultative Congress]) to the government at its actual value, and to return all 19 *mu* of land outside the wall to the masses.

Allied Commander MacArthur ignored these demands, and after the large demonstration of 250,000 people on the 18th, suddenly issued a statement on the 20th to stop the mass movement of the Japanese people, stating: \"The unruly elements (?), now beginning to employ tangible acts of intimidation, should not be allowed to continue for long,\" and stating: \"If the minority elements (?) in Japanese society no longer exercise self-control and self-respect, I will have to take necessary steps to manage them.\"\n    After MacArthur's statement was issued, the Japanese Communist Party and public opinion criticized it.

It also accused Acheson of not being familiar with Japanese customs, stating: Chairman Acheson believes that the May Day letter is unreliable because the letter was not signed. However, it is a Japanese custom that a letter from a gathering does not require individual signatures. The letter was drafted by Kobayashi of the News and Postal Workers' Union, approved by the Executive Committee on April 27th, and read to 500,000 union members gathered at the Imperial Palace Outer Garden on May Day, and the resolution was passed. Acheson claims that the various examples in the May Day letter are unreliable. We declare that all these examples are facts.

The fishing industry along the coast of the Bohai Sea is traditionally well-developed, especially the Luanxian fishing ground, which was the largest, with over 20,000 fishermen and over 1,800 odd-jobbers before the war. The annual output of fish and shrimp was over 100 million jin. The local democratic government has now provided loans of 60 million yuan specifically for the purpose of promoting the fishing industry. The mountainous areas of northern Jidong, such as Qian'an and Zunhua, are rich in more than ten kinds of fruits, with an annual output of over 2.5 million jin, which are sold to various parts of North China. This spring, the democratic governments in various places helped the masses to universally organize dried and fresh fruit cooperatives to improve planting and storage methods in order to export large quantities. In industrial production, such as the paper-making industry in Qian'an, more than 600 paper mills have now resumed work, and preparations are underway to establish a public-private paper company. The Lin Nancang area of Yutian is rich in reeds. There are now more than 100,000 people engaged in weaving and transporting reed mats, with a monthly output of 250,000 to 300,000 pieces.

In the Third District of Anguo, 41 out of 45 villages have established mutual aid groups. In the First District of Anping, 25 villages have organized 363 groups. These organizations are formed voluntarily by the masses and are not bound by fixed forms. This type of organization is even more widespread in Gaoyang. According to statistics from mid-April, about 30% or more of the villages in the county have organized mutual aid groups for both men and women. The production difficulties of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, the poor, and the widowed are also resolved through mutual aid. Anguo labor hero Yu Zhixiang united 119 households (out of a total of 281 households) in Liujiazuo Village to establish 10 mutual aid groups and 4 women's textile groups. Based on agricultural mutual aid, he further organized 11 production groups for cotton ginning, weaving, cigarette rolling, and transportation and sales. In these mutual aid activities, the integration of agriculture with various small businesses and handicrafts is even closer. For example, among the mutual aid groups in the 25 villages of the First District of Anping, there are as many as 25 types of activities combined with agriculture, including weaving basket bottoms, weaving towels, weaving cloth, cotton ginning, making toothbrushes, rolling cigarettes, oil pressing, adobe making, brick firing, and transportation and sales. Many villages have adopted small-scale cooperative forms of mutual aid management for handicrafts and household sideline occupations.

Militia joint defense in the border areas should cooperate with our army to closely monitor the wheat grabbing activities of the stubborn and puppet troops, resolutely strike at those who grab wheat, and help the masses with the harvest. 3. Militia in the hinterland should combine wheat harvesting with anti-espionage work to prevent sabotage by hidden enemy agents. In Tangyin County, a border area of Taihang, the masses in various villages have restored armed joint defense, ready to defend themselves at any time, protect the wheat harvest, and resolutely prevent the reactionaries from stealing the wheat. The militia in each village has undergone review and rectification and has universally organized combat groups led by cadres in person. The sentries in the county strictly check pedestrians and report the activities of secret agents and saboteurs to ensure a smooth wheat harvest. In the Shouyang border area, villages have also organized wheat harvest protection committees to step up leadership in the mass harvest work.

Then, President Fan explained the difference between Peking University and the schools in the Great Rear Area, stating that schools in the Liberated Areas have freedom of speech, publication, and assembly, and everyone is welcome to put forward their opinions for joint discussion and research. With our joint efforts, we have the confidence to make Peking University a democratic, free, and people-serving school. Finally, the professors elected Mr. Wang He to deliver a reply, he said: \"I have two different feelings after arriving in the Liberated Area: (1) The Liberated Area is a new dictionary, containing words such as 'revolution,' 'democracy,' 'peace,' 'active production,' and 'labor,' which cannot be found in the corrupt and backward old dictionary of the Kuomintang-controlled area. (2) I hope that on the basis of joint research and mutual learning, we can create three types of soldiers: 'political soldiers,' 'economic soldiers,' and 'cultural soldiers,' in order to take on the task of peaceful construction of the new China.\" Afterwards, the Peking University and the former two theatrical troupes jointly performed entertainment programs, and the entire venue was filled with a happy atmosphere of democracy and unity, dispersing only at 11 o'clock at night.\n\n \n**Named Entities**\n\n北方大学  Běifāng Dàxué (Northern University)\n邢台  Xíngtái\n平津  Píng Jīn (Peiping-Tianjin)\n昆明  Kūnmíng\n西安  Xī'ān\n东北  Dōngběi (Northeast)\n陈  Chén\n王  Wáng\n余  Yú\n关  Guān\n谢  Xiè\n北大  Běidà (Peking University)\n罗秘书  Luó Mìshū (Secretary Luo)\n范校长  Fàn Xiàozhǎng (President Fan)\n王鹤  Wáng Hè\n国民党统治区  Guómíndǎng tǒngzhì qū (Kuomintang-controlled areas)\n解放区  Jiěfàngqū (Liberated Area)\n大后方  Dà hòufāng (Great Rear Area)\n政治兵  zhèngzhì bīng (political soldiers)\n经济兵  jīngjì bīng (economic soldiers)\n文化兵  wénhuà bīng (cultural soldiers)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北方大学举行盛大晚会  欢迎新来教授同学  王鹤教授说：解放区的和平民主，在国民党统治区是看不到的。\n\n1946-05-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北方大学举行盛大晚会\n    欢迎新来教授同学\n    王鹤教授说：解放区的和平民主，在国民党统治区是看不到的。\n    【本报邢台讯】北方大学于日前举行千余人盛大晚会，欢迎新从平津、昆明、西安、东北等地来此执教的陈、王、余、关、谢诸教授和自大后方来学习的诸同学，首由北大罗秘书代表全校师生向他们致敬，继由范校长说明北大与大后方学校的不同，说明解放区的学校有言论、出版、集会的自由，大家有意见尽量提出，共同讨论研究。在我们共同努力下，有信心把北大办成一个民主、自由、为人民服务的学校。最后诸教授推选王鹤先生致答词，他说：“我到解放区有两种不同的感觉：（一）解放区是一部新字典，内有“革命”、“民主”、“和平”、“积极生产”、“劳动”等，这在国民党统治区腐败落后的老字典里是找不到的。（二）希望大家在共同研究互相学习的基础上能够造成三种兵“政治兵”、“经济兵”、“文化兵”，以便担任新中国的和平建设任务。后由北大和平原两剧团共同表演游艺节目，全场充满民主团结的愉快空气，夜十一点方散。"

The District Office was ransacked, eight rifles and pistols were looted, and over 100,000 Jibi were stolen, and two people were captured. Upon learning of this bloody tragedy, the Standing Committee of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Assembly, representing the 30 million people of the border region, issued a telegram, lodging a serious protest against this breach of agreement and brutality by the Nationalist Army. The telegram stated: \"The Xifanghu incident fully demonstrates that the Kuomintang reactionaries, in their attempt to launch a larger-scale civil war, are first eliminating our border region's democratic government,\" and pointed out, \"We must be seriously vigilant. The Xifanghu tragedy is by no means accidental, but a planned bloody massacre by the Nationalist Army. In Xiuwu alone, the tragedies occurring in recent days include: on the 14th, the Kuomintang Xiuwu Security Regiment attacked our Daiwang Village. On the night of the 15th, this unit raided our Wangtianquan again, killing eight cadres and villagers, and capturing over 30 villagers and several militiamen; that same night, the Nationalist Army stationed in Miaozhuang raided our Xiaowangjia Village District Office, arresting over ten people. The Nationalist Army in Mulandian also raided our Wangjia Village at the same time, arresting eight people. On the 16th, this unit raided our Meng Village again.\" The telegram concluded by calling on the people of the border region to strengthen their self-defense forces, to resolutely shatter the Kuomintang reactionaries' conspiracy to continue expanding the civil war and creating large-scale bloody tragedies, and appealed to the people of the nation for support.\n\n<BLANK_LINE>\n<BLANK_LINE>\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n<BLANK_LINE>\n<BLANK_LINE>\n\n修武城\tXiuwu Cheng (Xiuwu City)\n国民党三十二军\tGuomindang Sanshier Jun (Nationalist 32nd Army)\n修武民主政府\tXiuwu Minzhu Zhengfu (Xiuwu Democratic Government)\n公安局\tGongan Ju (Public Security Bureau)\n警戒线\tJingjie Xian (警戒线)\n三区公所\tSan Qu Gongsuo (Third District Office)\n西方斛村\tXifanghu Cun (Xifanghu Village)\n韩克俭\tHan Kejian\n王世英\tWang Shiying\n晋冀鲁豫边区参议会\tJin-Ji-Lu-Yu Bianqu Canyihui (Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Assembly)\n待王村\tDaiwang Cun (Daiwang Village)\n修武保安团\tXiuwu Baoan Tuan (Xiuwu Security Regiment)\n王田泉\tWangtianquan\n苗庄\tMiaozhuang\n小王家庄区公所\tXiaowangjia Zhuang Qu Gongsuo (Xiaowangjia Village District Office)\n木栾店\tMulandian\n王家庄\tWangjia Zhuang\n孟村\tMeng Cun\n冀钞\tJi Chao (Jibi - currency of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 又一残酷暴行！  修武国民党军奔袭我区署我区长区政委惨遭杀害  边区参议会通电全国抗议\n\n1946-05-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　又一残酷暴行！\n    修武国民党军奔袭我区署我区长区政委惨遭杀害\n    边区参议会通电全国抗议\n    【本报特讯】驻修武城之国民党三十二军一部结合特务五十余人，于十三日夜，假充我修武民主政府之公安局，偷越民兵警戒线，深入我腹地，奔袭三区公所驻地西方斛村，将我区长韩克俭政委王世英等同志击毙，区公所被捣毁，抢去长短枪八枝，冀钞十万余元，抓去二人。晋冀鲁豫边区参议会驻委会闻悉这一流血惨案，顷代表边区三千万人民发出通电，对国民党军此种违约暴行提出严重抗议。原电略称：西方斛事件充分表明国民党反动派，在其企图发动更大规模的内战的时候，首先消灭我边区民主政府，继指出：“我们必须严重警惕，西方斛惨案绝不是偶然的，而是国民党军有计划的血腥屠杀行为，只修武一地连日发生的惨案即有：十四日国民党修武保安团袭击我待王村。十五日夜该部再奔袭我王田泉杀死该村干部与群众八人，俘去群众三十余人及民兵数人；同夜，驻苗庄之国民党军奔袭我小王家庄区公所，抓走十余人，木栾店之国民党军亦于同时奔袭我王家庄抓去八人，十六日该部再奔袭我孟村”。该电最后号召边区人民加强自卫力量，有力的粉碎国民党反动派继续扩大内战大规模制造流血惨案的阴谋，并呼吁全国人民予以支援。"

In the Batavia area, British and Dutch troops and East Indian patriotic forces have engaged in fierce fighting. The sound of artillery and machine gun fire is constantly heard in the city. East Indian newspapers point out that the purpose of the Dutch and British troops' offensive is to destroy the fighting will of the East Indian people. The war is being conducted under the pretext of \"countering extremists.\" East Indian newspapers report that the Dutch and British troops will pay a heavy price but will gain nothing. The East Indian people are prepared to fight to the end for freedom. The East Indian army has braved the intense firepower of British and Dutch air force and artillery for several weeks, holding its ground in Semarang and Surabaya and repelling enemy attacks, which is a manifestation of the East Indian people's fighting will.

Mook admitted at a press conference that there was still no agreement between him and Sjahrir. The East Indian side believes that Mook's remarks may be a signal for a new Dutch military offensive and can also be regarded as a failure to split the internal unity of East India.

    "content": "【Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 24th】In January, Fucun Village, Pingyao, conducted a struggle to eliminate traitors and settle accounts, but it failed to genuinely mobilize the masses. After the cadres left, the remaining forces of the enemy and puppets, led by Wang Shijie, the former puppet district assistant, regrouped their strength to launch a counter-attack against the masses through clan relations (the village is mainly composed of the Ren and Wang surnames) and bribery. After making secret arrangements, they forced households to participate in the so-called \"mass meeting,\" with punishment for those who did not attend and expulsion from the \"clan.\" They also arrested active members of the liquidation struggle on false pretenses, forcing the masses to return the land they had obtained through liquidation to the puppet personnel, and fabricated rumors to intimidate the masses. When the rent reduction training class work team arrived in the village, the masses were afraid to tell the cadres the truth and dared not attend meetings. The cadres then went to help the masses with production and conduct in-depth investigations. At a meeting of active members, it was discovered that landlords were passing on public grain quotas to tenant farmers, and the masses were afraid to speak out. The work team started by addressing the issue of public grain, discovered new active members, and then, in coordination with the Farmers' Association, first united sixteen tenant farmers, providing them with special rent reduction education. Through them, nearly a hundred tenant farmers were mobilized to launch a struggle against the landlord Wang Weiran to reduce rent and redeem land. Wang Shiji, whose family was ruined by Wang Weiran's usury and plunder, immediately recovered twenty-two mu of land, which immediately motivated farmers throughout the village to rise up and fight against puppet personnel and landlord bullies, recover the land seized by traitors and puppets, and launch a rent reduction and account settlement movement against landlords, increasing wages.

On the afternoon of the 8th of this month, all teachers and students of the Provincial Huaiyuan Middle School went to Da Wang Temple on the north bank of the Wo River to move bricks and tiles. They encountered a large boat belonging to the 12th Poison Gas Defense Battalion of the Military Affairs Department stationed in Huaiyuan. After the soldiers on the boat landed, they forcibly enlisted the school staff to carry goods. Teachers and students of the school came forward to reason with them, but unexpectedly, the officers of the battalion fired shots as a warning and tied up the school's military training instructor and several students, immersing them in the river to be waterboarded, subjecting them to extreme humiliation. More than 30 soldiers of the battalion, originally stationed in the city, also rushed to the scene with guns upon hearing the news. They opened fire on the school's teachers and students. After several tens of minutes, the squad leader of the battalion, Hu Zhonggui, led them back to camp singing a little tune. Student Yuan Yongxi was shot and killed on the spot. ××× was shot in the chest and is in critical condition. Others who were lightly injured and fell into the water include Ruan Zhenhua, Li Guangyi, and others. After the incident, the school's teachers and students immediately issued a declaration, expressing serious protest against this inhuman atrocity, demanding that the murderers be punished and that personal freedom be guaranteed. Students from nearby schools and people from all walks of life also expressed their hatred and launched a support movement, while also donating funds to comfort the dead and injured students.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n安徽  Anhui\n怀远  Huaiyuan\n涡河  Wo River\n大王庙  Da Wang Temple\n军政部  Military Affairs Department\n第十二防毒大队  12th Poison Gas Defense Battalion\n延安  Yan'an\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n袁永锡  Yuan Yongxi\n阮振华  Ruan Zhenhua\n李广义  Li Guangyi\n胡中桂  Hu Zhonggui\n国民党  Kuomintang (Nationalist Party)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 怀远国民党军开枪行凶  无辜师生血染涡河  国民党军强拉校工搬运货物怀中师生据理交涉惨遭枪杀\n\n1946-05-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　怀远国民党军开枪行凶\n    无辜师生血染涡河\n    国民党军强拉校工搬运货物怀中师生据理交涉惨遭枪杀\n    【新华社延安二十三日电】安徽怀远通讯：此间发生国民党军队，公然枪杀学生的大惨案。本月八日下午省立怀远中学，全体师生前往涡河北岸大王庙搬运砖瓦，恰遇军政部驻怀远的第十二防毒大队所有大船一只靠岸，船上士兵上岸后即强拉怀中校工搬货。该校师生上前据理交涉，不料该队官员竟鸣枪示威，并将该校军训教官及学生多人，捆绑浸入河内灌水，凌辱备至。该队原驻城内的士兵三十余名，也闻讯荷枪赶来。纷向该校师生开枪射击，数十分钟后，始由该队分队长胡中桂率领，高唱小调回营，计有学生袁永锡当场被击毙命。×××弹入胸中，命在旦夕其余轻伤落水者，有阮振华、李广义等多人。事后该校师生立即发表宣言，对此惨绝人寰的暴行，表示严重抗议，要求惩办凶手，保障人身自由。附近各校学生，及各界人士，也莫不切齿痛恨，并发起声援运动，同时纷纷捐款唁恤死伤学生。"

Kuomintang troops on other fronts are also gradually nibbling away at us. The situation in this region is indeed more serious than generally imagined.

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "People in Disaster\n    A Glimpse of Xin Hui Under \"Nationalist Army\" Occupation\n    Liu Min\n    With the intrusion of the Nationalist troops into northern Henan, the peaceful and free life of the people in northern Henan has once again plunged into a dark sea of suffering.\n    When this group of troops invaded the liberated areas of Xinxiang, Huixian, and Huojia, the enemy-puppet slavery system (the \"Big Township System\"), which had long been sentenced to death by the people, and the feudal shackles (the Baojia System of collective responsibility) that ruled the people, were the first to be restored. Under each big township's joint security, a group of special agent armed forces, organized by local ruffians, hooligans, and tyrannical bullies, fattened themselves. Coordinating with the Nationalist army's internal war offensives, they were like a pack of ferocious jackals, destroying the democratic governments elected by the people in each village, as well as the mass organizations themselves. In particular, the peasant associations and militias that led the masses in their liberation were the targets of their brutal bloodshed. The disasters suffered by the people in the past six months are impossible to count! According to an incomplete survey of nine villages in Huixian and four villages in Huojia in one month alone, 28 farmers were brutally murdered, including two women. The secretary of the village office in Dazancheng Village, Huixian, had his arms chopped off and was eventually shot! The mother of Chen Yuetian and Chen Zhaodian from Ying Village was cruelly strangled to death by Nationalist special agent hitmen, and her body was thrown into a well. Why did they hate them so much? Because the former was a member of the peasant association, who had once led the peasants in resolutely opposing traitors, and the latter was a family member of a revolutionary martyr. The most tragic encounter was that of Guo Fengde, a militiaman from Nanxiaoying. He was a hero who led the entire village in anti-special agent and anti-traitor activities during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Now that the traitors and special agents have become \"central dignitaries,\" Guo Fengde and his wife were buried alive because of this. Guo's property and houses were also completely confiscated...\n    Cruel bloodshed and terror continue to be inflicted upon the people in the occupied areas. In every town and village in Xinxiang, Huojia, Huixian, and other places, the faces of millions of people are covered with sorrow. The Baojia system suffocates them. They want to escape, but the chain law blocks them. Recently, the Nationalist Party issued a \"National Identification Card\" with strict control. Anyone who does not wear the \"Identification Card\" is considered a \"communist bandit\" and will be killed. What is most strange is that in many areas, farmers still wear the \"Good Citizen Certificates\" issued by the enemy. The only slight difference is that a Nationalist Party emblem has been newly stamped on the \"Good Citizen Certificates.\"\n    These self-proclaimed \"people-saving\" troops have not considered the people's desire for peace. On the contrary, from the first day they invaded the liberated areas, they used bayonets to force the people to build fortifications for the civil war on a large scale. Going north from Xinxiang along the Pinghan Railway, many enemy-puppet bunkers that had been leveled by the people were rebuilt one by one. Some places have even increased by two or three times. There is one every one and a half miles. Within three months, twelve new bunkers were added to Qixian Chengguan, four were added to Dongfangdian, and five were added to Gaocun. Near Yuhe, Huixian, there are as many as fifteen to thirty large and small bunkers. Along with the construction of internal war fortifications and bunkers, slips for dispatching bricks, tiles, laborers, wood, etc., are like random arrows, viciously shooting at the people who yearn for peace. A village of sixty-two households in Boyu Township, a suburb of Jixian, was forced to dispatch 20,000 bricks and tiles, thirteen mud and wood craftsmen, one hundred laborers, thirteen large beams and purlins, forty wooden boards, 10,000 catties of firewood, 2,500 catties of military wheat, and 100,000 yuan in funds in two days. From then on, the people were so busy that they could not catch their breath. Only the bunkers and fortifications increased rapidly on the peasants' lovely land. The four acres of vegetable garden that the poor peasant Li Fengqun in Yutun, Huojia, depended on for a living were occupied by bunkers and trenches, and the owners of more than thirty households with three hectares of fertile land in Yaotun lost their homes because of this. Moreover, the people's houses, bricks, and trees near the villages in more villages were requisitioned. Going east from Huiyuhe, tens of miles of plains no longer see brick houses and green trees. A local folk song truly depicts the disasters of the people: \"The bricks are all donated! The trees are all sawed off! The men are all conscripted! The land is all barren!\"\n    The War of Resistance Against Japan has been won. In the liberated areas, millions of peaceful people are carrying out a large-scale production movement and building on a large scale to quickly restore the wounds of the eight-year war. However, for the people of Xinhui and Huojia who live in the bunker grid, victory has not brought them anything. The \"Nationalist Army\" guarding the bunkers and the special agents scattered everywhere make them still enjoy the same suffering as during the war. Every day, the \"Nationalist Army\" has to go to the countryside to \"clean up the countryside,\" saying that they are there to check on \"bandits,\" but the houses that have been cleared are like those that have encountered the \"mopping up\" of the Japanese devils. All food and property are looted. After the \"Nationalist Army\" cleared the countryside in a large household in Hujiahuamu Village, three mules were taken away, and the eldest son was kidnapped. A peddler in Bali Village had 70,000 yuan in legal tender also \"cleaned\" away. The coal of five coal-pulling villagers in Zhongtang Village was robbed, and all five were shot. In the countryside cleanup, the women there also suffered an unprecedented catastrophe. According to a survey of nine villages in the fourth district of Huojia, there were very few women from good families who were not insulted by the \"Nationalist Army.\" More than a dozen daughters-in-law from the wealthy Zhou Jiacai family were raped in turn by the \"Nationalist Army\" after the men of the family were driven out. The wife of the middle peasant Tang Baofu lived in a platoon of soldiers from the 85th Army of the Nationalist Party. Every night, this woman from a good family suffered inhuman rape. Once, the 85th Army in Baofen Temple had a more whimsical idea and pretended to hold a meeting. As a result, eleven young women in the meeting place were taken away. The \"Nationalist Army\" in the countryside cleanup had the same interest in catching chickens as the Imperial Army. They often went in groups of three or five to catch the chickens of ordinary people. Once in Zhangjiatun, I came across a platoon of soldiers from the 85th Army who were returning \"victoriously,\" each with three or five fat chickens hanging on the tips of their guns. Looking closer at the village, soldiers holding knives and sticks were scattered in the courtyards and walls of the ordinary people. The whole village was frightened, and the three egg-laying hens of the poor peasant Wang Yuxing were all snatched away, which made the whole family cry for a long time. In addition, in the grid, there are also popular \"four mores.\" That is, \"more special agent black guns, more prostitutes, more gambling, and more opium.\" A folk song describes this world saying:\n    \"The Nationalist Army is the same as the Imperial Army,\n    They rob and rob until everything is gone,\n    They are fat,\n    The people suffer from famine.\"\n    Having traveled all over the \"Nationalist Army\" occupied areas in northern Henan, people from all walks of life have felt great disappointment in the Nationalist Party army. They eagerly look forward to the Eighth Route Army and the democratic government, because the heavy burden makes it impossible for them to live any longer. Yan Chunrong, a poor family member of a revolutionary martyr in Fangtai Village, Xinxiang, did not have any burden under the democratic government. Now, he has to bear five dou and five sheng of grain and 7,000 yuan in donations for repairing blockhouses in one month. Zhu Fajun, a middle peasant in Xiaozhancheng, Huixian, has eleven people and cultivates twenty-three mu of land. Under the democratic government, he had to bear a total of five dou of grain in two seasons. To pay the grain dispatched by the Nationalist Army, he has to pay as much as five shi. Yuan Qingyu, a rich peasant in Fangtai Village, Huojia, cultivates fifty mu of land and feeds three animals. Last summer, he harvested 23 shi of grain, and was levied 20 shi and 2 dou, accounting for 80% of his annual income. There are simply too many others who cannot live because of forced conscription!\n    However, the people who have been tempered by the eight-year war are no longer sheep. They know how to wage a firm and unyielding struggle in order to strive for the early realization of their own peace and freedom. This power of the people will smash all the chains that rule the people. Now the people in these areas who cannot live have widely launched a movement to resist corvée and resist conscription and strike (repairing bunkers). People from all walks of life have eagerly shouted out their hopes. The wealthy households said:\n    \"Thinking of the Eighth Route Army,\n    Looking forward to the Eighth Route Army,\n    The Eighth Route Army will reduce the taxes.\"\n    The broadest masses of working people said:\n    \"Thinking of the Eighth Route Army,\n    Looking forward to the Eighth Route Army,\n    The Eighth Route Army will reduce the rent.\"\n    The evil civil war has made the Nationalist Party soldiers who do not want to be cannon fodder even more war-weary. One clear and moonlit night, on the Nationalist Party bunker line in Huojia, a sentry with a southern accent was humming a poignant and meaningful ditty.\n    \"The moon is curved, long and long,\n    My hometown is in the south,\n    Soldiers were originally for fighting the Japanese,\n    Who knew they would be sent to the civil war battlefield.\n    …………………\n    …………………\n    Being cannon fodder, fighting the civil war, I won't do things that lose my conscience!\n    Being cannon fodder, fighting the civil war, I won't do things that lose my conscience!\"\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    China\n河南    Henan\n豫北    Northern Henan\n新乡    Xinxiang\n辉县    Huixian\n获嘉    Huojia\n国民党军队 Nationalist Army\n八路军    Eighth Route Army\n大乡制  Big Township System\n保甲制  Baojia System\n平汉路  Pinghan Railway\n淇县    Qixian\n东坊店  Dongfangdian\n郜村    Gaocun\n峪河    Yuhe\n汲县    Jixian\n伯玉乡  Boyu Township\n峪屯    Yutun\n姚屯    Yaotun\n嘉滑木村 Hujiahuamu Village\n八里村  Bali Village\n中堂村  Zhongtang Village\n张家屯  Zhangjiatun\n方台村  Fangtai Village\n陈月田  Chen Yuetian\n陈照典  Chen Zhaodian\n郭凤得  Guo Fengde\n柳敏    Liu Min\n大赞城  Dazancheng\n营村    Ying Village\n南小营  Nanxiaoying\n栗凤群  Li Fengqun\n袁清玉  Yuan Qingyu\n阎春荣  Yan Chunrong\n朱法君  Zhu Fajun\n良民证  Good Citizen Certificate\n85军    85th Army\n包分庙  Baofen Temple\n王玉兴  Wang Yuxing\n周家财  Zhou Jiacai\n唐保富  Tang Baofu\n内战  Civil War\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 灾难中的人们  新辉获“国军”侵占区剪影\n柳敏\n1946-05-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　灾难中的人们\n    新辉获“国军”侵占区剪影\n    柳敏\n    随着侵入豫北的国民党军队，豫北人民和平自由的生活，又随入黑暗的苦海了。\n    当这批队伍侵入新乡、辉县、获嘉一带解放区时，早为人民宣判死刑的敌伪奴役制度（大乡制），与统治人民的封建镣铐（保甲制连坐法），首先被恢复起来，每个大乡联保下面，都养肥着一批由地痞流氓、狗腿恶霸组织起来的特务武装，配合着内战进攻的国民党军队，真像一群凶暴的豺狼，破坏着各村人民自己选举的民主政权，以及群众自己的团体，特别是领导群众翻身的农会和民兵，更是他们残酷血洗的对象。半年多来人民所受的灾难再也无法统计了！仅据辉县九个村、获嘉四个村一月不完全的调查，就有二十八位农民遭惨杀，其中两人是妇女。辉县大赞城村村公所书记，被砍去了两臂，最后被枪杀了！一位营村陈月田与陈照典的母亲，被国民党特务黑枪手残酷的勒死了，并把尸体投入了井底，为何他们如此仇恨他们呢？因为前者是农会会员，曾经领导农民，坚决反对过汉奸，后者因为是抗属。遭遇最惨的，是南小营的民兵郭凤得，他是抗战期间领导全村反特务反汉奸的英雄，现在汉奸特务成了“中央贵人”了，郭凤得与他的老婆，便因之被活埋了。郭的家产房屋，亦全部被没收……\n    残酷的血洗和恐怖，继续加诸占领区的人民。在新乡、获嘉、辉县等地的每个村镇，千千万万人民的脸上，都为愁容所笼罩了。保甲制窒息着他们。想逃走吧，连锁法封锁住他们。最近国民党又发行了一种统治严密的“国民身份证”，谁没有佩带“身份证”谁就被认为“奸匪”，而遭到杀害。其中最使人奇怪的，是很多地区，农民仍佩带着敌人发给的“良民证”，稍为不同的只是“良民证”上，新加盖了一个国民党党徽。\n    这些自命“救民”的军队，并没有顾及人民和平的渴望。恰相反，他们从侵入解放区的第一天起，即用刺刀强逼着人民大肆修筑内战的碉堡，从新乡顺着平汉路北走，曾被人民平毁的许多敌伪碉堡，又一一被修筑起来。有些地方更增了两三倍。每隔一里半远，就有一个。在淇县城关三月内就增修了十二个新碉堡，在东坊店添修了四个，在郜村添修了五个。辉县峪河附近，大小碉堡即筑有十五个至三十个之多。随着内战工事碉堡的修筑，派砖、派坯、派夫、派木料等的条子，就像乱箭一样，恶毒的射在渴望和平的人民身上。汲县城郊伯玉乡一个六十二户人家的村庄，在两天内，就强派了砖坯两万块，泥木工匠十三名，民夫一百名，大梁檩条十三根，木板四十块，木柴一万斤，军麦二千五百斤，派款十万元。从此，人民忙得喘不过气来，只见在农民可爱的土地上，碉堡工事迅速增多了。获嘉峪屯贫农栗凤群，四亩赖以为生的菜园都被碉堡壕沟所占住，姚屯三顷良田的三十余户主人因之失掉了家园。而更多村庄的民房，砖头以及村庄附近的树木，更是抢征一光。从辉峪河东行，数十里的平原，已再看不见砖房和绿树，当地有一首民谣真是灾难人民的深刻的写照：“砖头捐光啦！树木锯光啦！男人支光啦！土地全荒啦！”\n    抗战胜利了。在解放区，千千万万和平的人民，正开展大生产运动，大兴土木，以迅速恢复八年战争创伤，可是生活在碉堡格子网内的新获辉人民，胜利却并未带给他们什么，守望在碉堡内的“国军”，和散布各地的特务，使他仍然享受着战争期间一样的苦难，每天“国军”却要下乡来“清乡”，说是来盘查“土匪”，但是经过清查的人家，就好象遭遇过日寇的“扫荡”一样，一切粮食财物都被洗劫一光。辉嘉滑木村一家大户，在“国军”清乡后，三个骡子被牵走了，大儿子被绑票了。八里村一位小贩，七万元法币也被“清”缴了。中堂村五个拉煤老乡的煤被抢走了，五人全被枪毙了。在清乡中，那里的妇女们也遭受着空前的浩劫，据获嘉四区九个村的调查，良家妇女，很少不被“国军”侮辱的，大户周家财家闺女媳妇十余人，被“国军”将全家男人赶出后，即实行了轮奸，中农唐保富之妻，家里住着国民党八十五军一排的士兵，每天晚上，这位良家妇女，即遭受着惨无人道的轮奸，有一次包分庙的八十五军更异想天开，假装以开会为名，结果会场中十一位青年妇女，便被拉走了。清乡中的“国军”和皇军一样有着捕鸡的兴趣，他们经常三五成群去捕捉老百姓的鸡子，有一次在张家屯我曾碰着一排八十五军的士兵，正“胜利”归来，每人的枪尖上，都挂着三五只肥鸡。再走近村一看，老百姓院里墙上，还散布着拿刀执棍的士兵，整个村里吓得鸡飞狗跳，贫农王玉兴三只下蛋的母鸡，便被一拥抢光了，气得全家大哭了半天。此外，在格子网内，还流行着“四多”。那就是“特务黑枪多、破鞋多、赌博多、大烟料子多。”民间有首歌谣描写这种世道说：\n    “国军皇军一个样，\n    抢来抢去一齐光，\n    他们吃胖了，\n    百姓遭饥荒”。\n    走遍了豫北“国军”侵占区各地，各种不同阶层的人们，他们已对国民党军队，感到极大的失望，他们极切的盼望着八路军和民主政府，因为苛重的负担，使他们再也不能生活了，新乡方台村穷苦抗属阎春荣，民主政府时，完全不负担，现在一月即负担修炮楼粮五斗五升捐款七千元，辉县小占城中农朱法君，十一口人，种二十三亩地，对民主政府两季负担粮共五斗，交国民党军派粮，即达五石，获嘉方台村富农袁清玉，种五十亩地，喂三头牲口，去夏收粮二十三石，即被征派二十石二斗，占全年收入百分之八十。其他因强征而不能生活者，那简直是太多了！\n    但是经过八年战争锻炼的人民，他们已再不是绵羊，他们知道为争取自己和平自由的早日实现，应如何坚定不屈的进行斗争。这种人民的力量，将会把统治人民的一切锁链，打得粉碎。现在这些地区无法生活的人民，已广泛的开展了抗差抗征与怠工（修堡）运动。各种不同阶层的人，都渴望的喊出了自己的希望，富户们说：\n    “想八路，\n    盼八路，\n    八路来了少出赋。”\n    最广大的劳动人民说：\n    “想八路，\n    盼八路，\n    八路来了能减租。”\n    罪恶的内战，使不愿作炮灰的国民党士兵，厌战情绪也更加高涨。一个风清月明的晚上，在获嘉国民党碉堡线上，一个南方口音的哨兵，在凄切的哼着意味深长的小调。\n    “月儿湾湾长又长，\n    我的家乡在南方，\n    当兵原是为的打日本，\n    谁知开到内战场。\n    …………………\n    …………………\n    当炮灰，打内战，丧掉良心的事儿我不干！\n    当炮灰，打内战，丧掉良心的事儿我不干！”"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Telegrams Should Be Concise\n　　To all Xinhua News Agency General Branch Offices, Branch Offices, Sub-Branch Offices, and Special Correspondents:\n\n　　Telegrams are an urgent tool for conveying social dynamics, and they represent the most streamlined form of news. They report the most important news with the most concise language and the highest speed. When writing telegrams, it is necessary not only to tighten sentences to save on telegram costs, but also to constantly maintain the idea: \"For the fastest possible reporting.\"\n\n　　However, our news telegrams, whether broadcast by the General Office or reported by the Branch Offices, often violate this principle, committing the faults of being lengthy and slow. As a result: First, there is a great waste of manpower and resources. The total number of words in telegrams from the Branch Offices in March was nearly 600,000, of which only 150,000 words, about a quarter, were adopted and broadcast by the General Office. The remaining three-quarters, or 450,000 words, were mostly wasted. These 450,000 words went through four hands from the Sub-Branch Offices to the Branch Offices, the General Branch Offices, and the General Office. Each transfer involved three procedures of editing, translating, and dispatching, totaling twelve procedures, wasting countless labor; and even the 150,000 words broadcast by the General Office were not necessarily all brilliant and usable. In fact, the amount adopted by various newspapers is at most 80%. Second, the abundance and length of稿[gǎo] often cause telegram congestion, inevitably leading to backlog phenomena, affecting the rapid dispatch of important稿[gǎo], and many news items often lose their timeliness as a result. Third, the enthusiasm for dumping quantity neglects the improvement of quality, hindering the rapid improvement of business technology. Fourth, and most importantly, although a lot of manpower and material resources are spent, due to fragmentary news, poor content, and inferior technology, it is difficult to be captivating and the propaganda effect is weak.\n\n　　The reasons for the lengthiness of telegrams are no more than three: First, news is mixed with too much subjective commentary. We are not good at \"letting the facts speak for themselves\" and clarifying our views and attitudes through facts, so we inevitably fall into empty preaching. This kind of preaching sometimes appears as an editor's note, sometimes takes the form of mixed narration and commentary, and sometimes is simply a frank and unrestrained discussion. Regardless of the form, it is unnecessary in most cases (except in individual cases). Also, our \"introductions\" or \"conclusions\" sometimes lack specific content and are disconnected from the news facts themselves, resembling slogans. This is actually another form of commentary, which fails to truly serve as an \"introduction\" or \"conclusion,\" but instead drowns out vivid facts, burdens the news, and causes the reader's dislike. Second, there is a lack of discernment in selecting materials. A single news item contains everything, including this and that. A large pile of current facts becomes a running account or a jumble, without knowing how to extract the essence and discard the dross, resulting in lengthy and verbose writing, while the truly typical and important content cannot be highlighted. This phenomenon is very common, whether in military news, introductions to production and construction, or reports on mass movements. Third, there is a lack of attention to presentation methods and saving words, with no distinction between telegrams and news, or even between telegrams and feature articles. Some branch offices often send news feature articles from local newspapers with a snip of the scissors. Upon receipt, the words \"This Newspaper Report\" or \"This Newspaper Feature Article\" are still prominently displayed, proving that they have not truly undergone the editing process, completing procedures such as sorting, supplementing, cutting, and rewriting. Therefore, they are generally raw materials rather than processed and revised news products. Raw materials are very rough and complex, requiring more words.\n\n　　To solve this problem, we must start from ideological, business, and technical aspects, and it requires the efforts of the General Office, the Branch Offices, and all comrades engaged in news work. Ideologically, we must recognize that Xinhua News Agency is already a national news agency. In the past, its news telegrams were exclusively supplied to newspapers in the liberated areas. Now, in addition to these basic positions, it is also necessary to strive for adoption by various newspapers and periodicals in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Peiping, and even abroad. In the past, its propaganda target was the masses in the liberated areas. Now, in addition to this basic readership, it has expanded to many urban residents in the newly liberated areas, and it must also take care of people from all walks of life in the Kuomintang areas. In the past, its task was mainly to exchange information, work, and experience among the liberated areas. Now, in addition to this basic task (which is of course still an extremely important task), it must also use news from the liberated areas as a foundation to organize a national news network, enter and exit the domestic news stage, and compete with other news organizations. As such, the standard of our news reporting must be improved, and both the content and technology must be improved to make it more substantial, faster, more vivid, and more concise, so that it can meet the requirements of national propaganda, satisfy the hopes of a wider readership, and accomplish complex and arduous combat tasks. At the same time, based on our own work foundation, except for individual branch offices, most branch offices have already roughly taken shape and are able to maintain a certain amount of news supply. Currently, the problem is not the continued increase in quantity, but mainly the improvement in quality, to achieve less but better, so that each news item can fulfill a certain role. This is a big change, urgently needed by the current new situation, and it represents a new development and progress in our work. We believe that as long as everyone thinks through this issue ideologically and works hard to do it, it can be resolved.\n\n　　In terms of business, we must strengthen editorial work, breaking the view that editing telegrams is purely a technical work, and we must clearly realize that editing telegrams is a political battle, and engage in this work with the highest sense of responsibility. We must investigate the readership more, study the propaganda attitudes of the enemy, friends, and ourselves. For each news item, seek the best reporting method to achieve the expected propaganda effect. We should cherish our own news works and constantly summarize our own writing experience to seek improvement. For example, news should not be mixed with commentary, comments and news should be separated as much as possible, materials should be selected and chosen, and truly important, typical, and vivid facts should be reported with a central emphasis. Writing should be concrete and concise, without wasting vivid materials or wasting writing skills. These can all be studied. In the style of news propaganda, we want to create a unique style, but in terms of reporting methods and writing techniques, we should learn more from others, especially from mature reporters in Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Their concise and lively style, their knack for making insightful points, their ability to grasp the essentials of everything, and their attitude of explaining the source of everything are very worthy of emulation.\n\n　　Technically, under the current conditions of equipment difficulties, we should pay attention to saving resources, cancel the unlimited use of radio stations, and even if we have our own radio stations, telegrams are still telegrams. Too many telegrams are congested, cannot be sent out, and we must consider the day when we leave our own radio station and spend money to send telegrams. Currently, the General Office's reporting platform is already unable to cope. Therefore, the General Office has decided to impose a reasonable and appropriate limit on telegrams from various branch offices, that is, in the future, General Branch Offices, except in truly special circumstances (these special circumstances should be determined according to changes in the struggle situation; currently, the Northeast Branch Office can be considered an exception), should not send more than 2,000 words per day. This restriction is not purely passive, but gives each branch office a task, requiring them to improve the quality of news and fully utilize the reporting efficiency within the range of 2,000 words per day. Unlimited digital expansion will only lead to the indiscriminate issuance of news, technical and even political imprecision, while a certain word limit can improve the editor's sense of responsibility and promote the progress of reporting techniques. We believe that as long as the editing work is done well, 2,000 words per day is completely sufficient.\n\n　　We have talked about the need for news to be concise more than once. But the General Office and the Branch Offices have not done enough in this regard. Now, it is raised as a very important issue, and we hope that it will no longer be seen as a simple issue of the number of words, but as a basic entry point for transforming news writing techniques, as the key to improving news quality, and as the main path to focusing on propaganda methods and effectiveness. Only with this understanding can we solve the problem ideologically. We ask each branch office, after receiving this letter, to contact their own actual work, launch a discussion, and tell us the experience gained, as a reference for the General Office to improve editorial work. - Xinhua News Agency (Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th).\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    China\n新华通讯社  Xinhua News Agency\n北京    Beijing\n上海    Shanghai\n重庆    Chongqing\n北平    Peiping (Former name of Beijing)\n国民党    Kuomintang\n东北    Northeast\n延安    Yan'an\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 电讯要简练\n\n1946-05-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　电讯要简练新华社各地总分社、分社、支社暨特派记者：\n    电讯是传达社会动态的紧急工具，在新闻中是最精干的形式。它以最简洁的文字和最高度的速率，来报导最重要的新闻。撰著电讯，不但必须紧缩字句，从而节省电费，而且必须时刻存在一个观念：“为了最迅速的报导。”\n    然而我们的新闻电讯，无论总社广播或分社来报，往往违背这个原则，犯冗长和迟缓的毛病，结果：一，人力器材浪费很大。三月份分社来电总数，近六十万字，经总社采播的只十五万字，约四分之一，其余四分之三，即四十五万字，大多是浪费了。此四十五万字，由支社经分社总分社到总社，有四个转手，每次转手都是编、译、发三道手续，等于十二道手续，虚耗人工无法统计；而总社广播的十五万字，亦未必见得条条精彩，字字可用。事实上各报采用量，最多不过百分之八十。二，稿多且长，常使电报壅塞，难免发生积报现象，影响紧要稿件迅速发出，许多新闻往往因此失去时效。三，热中量的倾销，忽略质的提高，对业务技术不能迅速改进。四，最重要的是虽然花费人力物力不少，但由于新闻零碎，内容贫乏，技术低劣，难能引人入胜，宣传效果薄弱。\n    电讯冗长的原因，不外三个：一，是新闻中夹杂太多的主观议论，我们不善于“让事实自己说话”，通过事实来表明主张和态度，于是不免陷于空头的说教。这种说教有时以按语出之，有时采取夹叙夹议办法，有时率性正面的侃侃而谈。无论形式如何，在大多数场合，都是不必要的（个别场合例外）。还有我们的“导语”或“结尾”有时缺乏具体内容，而且和新闻事实本身脱节，类似标语口号，实际是议论的又一形式，不能真正起“导语”或“结尾”的作用，反而淹没生动的事实，使新闻受累，引起读者的憎厌。二，是材料不知取舍。一条新闻什么都有，这也要，那也要，当前的事实堆个一大堆，成为一篇流水账，或一盘杂货摊，而不知掘其精华弃其糟粕，以致文字冗长噜嗦，而真正典型和重要内容，反无法凸出。这种现象很普遍，无论军事消息，生产建设介绍，或群众运动报导，都常有这种病症。三，是没有讲究表现方法和节省文字，电讯和新闻不分，甚至和通讯不分。若干分社常驻当地报纸的新闻通讯，一剪刀发来，收到时，“本报讯”或“本报通讯”字样，还赫然在目，证明并未真正经过编辑过程，完成整理、补充、剪裁，改写等等手续，所以一般多为原料，而非加工改选过的新闻成品。毛坯是很粗糙庞杂的东西，它需要占更多的字数。\n    要解决这个问题，要从思想上业务上技术上三方面入手，并且需要总社、分社、和全体从事新闻工作同志的努力。在思想上，必须认识新华通讯社已经是个全国性的通讯社，过去它的新闻电讯一切专供应解放区报纸，现在除了这些基本阵地外，还要争取京、沪、渝、平乃至国外各种报刊采用。过去它的宣传对象是解放区群众，现在除了这部分基本读者以外，已经扩大到新解放区城市的许多市民，并且还必须照顾国民党区域的各阶层人士。过去它的任务，主要是交流各解放区的情形、工作、和经验，现在除了这个基本任务（当然仍是极重要的任务），还要以解放区新闻为基础，进而组织全国的新闻网，进出于国内新闻舞台，与其他新闻机关相抗衡。如是，我们新闻报导的水准，必须提高，内容和技术都要改进，使它更加充实，更加迅速，更加生动，更加简练，使之够得上全国宣传的要求，满足更广大的读者的希望，完成复杂而艰巨的战斗任务。同时以我们本身的工作基础来说，除了个别分社以外，一般分社都已粗具规模，能够保持一定数量的新闻供给。目前问题，不在于量的继续增多，主要还是质量的提高，做到少而精，使每条新闻都能尽到一定的作用，这是一个很大的变化，是当前新的情况所迫切需要的，它代表我们工作上的新的发展和进步。相信只要大家在思想上想通这个问题，认真努力去做，是可以获得解决的。\n    在业务上必须加强编辑工作，打破把编辑电讯当作纯技术工作的观点，必须明白意识到编辑电讯，就是政治上的作战，以最高的责任心来从事这一工作。要多调查读者对象，研究敌、友、我三方的宣传态度。每条新闻，寻求最好的报导方法，来达到宣传上的预期效果。对于本身的新闻作品，应该珍视，并且不断总结自身的写作经验，求得改进。比如新闻不夹杂议论，评论和新闻尽可能分开，材料要有取舍选择，真正重要典型的和生动的事实，进行中心凸出的报导。写作具体而扼要，既不糟踏生动材料，又不浪费文笔。这些都可加以研究。在新闻宣传的作风上，我们要创造独特的风格，但在报导方法和写作技术方面，我们应该多多向他人学习，尤其向英、美、苏那些成熟的记者学习，他们那种简洁明快的笔调，画龙点睛的手法，凡事抓着要领的技能，以及事事说明出处的态度，是很值得取法的。\n    在技术上，在目前器材困难的条件下，要注意节省物力，取消无限制使用电台，即使自己有电台，但电报总是电报，压得太多，发不出来，而且要设想到会有一天离开自己电台，花钱发电的时候。现在总社的通报台，事实上已经应付不过来。为此，总社决定，对各分社来个人为的适当限制，就是今后总分社单位除了真正特殊情况外（这种特殊情况应随斗争形势的变化决定，目前东北分社可属于特殊情况的例外），每日发电不得超过二千字。这种限制，并非纯粹消极性的，而是给各分社一个任务，要求提高新闻质量，每日在二千字范围内，充分发挥报导效能。无限制的数字膨胀，只会造成新闻的滥发，技术上乃至政治上的不精细，而一定字数的限制，反可提高编辑的责任心，推动报导技术的进步。我们相信只要编辑工作做得好，每天二千字是完全够用了的。\n    新闻要简练，我们不止谈过一次。但总社和分社在这方面做得还很不够。现在作为很重大的问题提出，希望不要再把它看作一个简单的字数多少问题，而要看作是改造新闻写作技术上的基本入门，看作是提高新闻质量的关键，看作是讲求宣传方法和成效之大道。只有这样看法，我们思想上才能得到解决。我们要求各分社，在收到这封信后，联系本身实际工作，展开一个讨论，并将得到的经验告诉我们，以为总社改进编辑工作的参考。——新华通讯社（新华社延安二十四日电）。"

    "content": "After the Red Army's Scheduled Withdrawal from the Northeast\n    American Troops Remain in China, Aiding the Civil War\n    Massino Discusses the China Question Again\n    [New China News Agency, Yan'an, 24th] Moscow Radio commentator Massino, in another commentary on the China question, stated: Marshal Malinovsky's staff has officially announced that the withdrawal of the Red Army from Manchuria was completed on May 3rd. In the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers last December, Molotov and Byrnes reached an agreement that Soviet and American troops stationed in China should withdraw from China as soon as possible after fulfilling their duties and responsibilities. The Soviet Red Army's entry into Manchuria was intended to reduce Allied war casualties and liberate the Chinese people from Japanese enslavement. The Soviet Army had, and could have, no other purpose than this noble one. Therefore, after completing its mission of liberation, the Red Army withdrew from China. Moreover, the Red Army's withdrawal followed the statement made on February 16th this year by the representative of Marshal Malinovsky's staff, that the deadline for the Soviet Army's withdrawal from Manchuria would be before the deadline for the US military command to withdraw US troops from China. This plan has now been fully implemented. However, after the withdrawal of the Red Army troops from Manchuria, fierce fighting broke out between the Chinese Kuomintang army and the Northeast Democratic Allied Army. According to reliable sources, the Kuomintang army is using American weapons, and American aircraft are also helping the Kuomintang army bomb the Democratic Allied Army, causing extreme indignation among the Democratic Allied Army. At the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers, Byrnes argued that the United States bears the primary responsibility for implementing the terms of Japan's surrender, namely, disarming the Japanese army and repatriating Japanese nationals. Byrnes stated that as soon as these responsibilities are fulfilled, or when the Chinese government no longer needs American help in fulfilling these responsibilities, the US military will immediately withdraw from China. However, according to Chinese and American newspaper reports, the assistance given by the US military in North China is of a different nature. The US military is not helping the Kuomintang to disarm the Japanese army and repatriate Japanese nationals, but is helping to transfer Kuomintang troops trained and equipped by the United States to fight the Northeast Democratic Allied Army. Martin, the New York Times correspondent in Tianjin, reported: In North China, in every city where American troops are stationed, hostility towards the American military is increasing. American soldiers do not feel like liberators, but feel like conquerors. Martin pointed out that American soldiers themselves see clearly that their presence in China is not for military needs, but for political reasons. American soldiers are often heard stating that they should help Chiang Kai-shek's army wage a civil war. But when American soldiers learned that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party had signed a ceasefire agreement on January 10th, they all stated: \"Now we will finally be called home!\" And the Chinese declared: \"It would be good if the American troops withdrew!\" But the American troops did not withdraw. The Washington Post also expressed anxiety about this, stating: \"We cannot give any guarantee as to when our troops will withdraw from North China.\" As for the opinions of the people of the Northeast, they demanded that Truman order the US military command in China to stop transporting troops and ammunition to aid the Chinese civil war, and should fulfill the promise of the US military's withdrawal from China; but when the people of the Northeast made these demands, they did not yet know that the United States was directly interfering in the civil war on the side of the Kuomintang.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n苏联    Soviet Union\n中国    China\n东北    Northeast\n满洲    Manchuria\n延安    Yan'an\n莫斯科  Moscow\n华北    North China\n天津    Tianjin\n\n马西努  Massino\n马林诺夫斯基  Malinovsky\n莫洛托夫  Molotov\n贝纳斯  Byrnes\n杜鲁门  Truman\n蒋介石  Chiang Kai-shek\n马丁  Martin\n\n新华社  New China News Agency\n国民党  Kuomintang\n东北民主联军  Northeast Democratic Allied Army\n纽约时报  New York Times\n华盛顿邮报  Washington Post\n\n三外长莫斯科会议  Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers\n日寇  Japanese invaders\n日本投降  Japanese surrender\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 红军如期撤离东北后  美军仍留华助长内战  马西努再论中国问题\n\n1946-05-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　红军如期撤离东北后\n    美军仍留华助长内战\n    马西努再论中国问题\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】莫斯科今日广播评论员马西努，再论中国问题称：马林诺夫斯基元帅参谋部，已正式宣布红军从满洲撤退工作，已于五月三日完结。去年十二月三外长莫斯科会议中，莫洛托夫与贝纳斯商谈结果，曾达到一致协定，说驻在中国的苏军与美军，在完成自己的义务与责任后，尽可能在最短时期内从中国撤退。苏联红军之进入满洲，是欲减少盟国战争牺牲，及将中国人民从日寇奴役下解放出来，苏军除了这一高尚目的外，没有而且不能有其它目的，因此，红军在完成自己的解放使命后，便从中国撤退了。而且红军的撤退，是遵照今年二月十六日马林诺夫斯基元帅参谋部代表的声明，即苏军从满洲撤退的期限，要在美军指挥部从中国撤退美军的期限之前，这一计划，现在已完全实行了。但红军部队从满洲撤退之后，中国国民党军与东北民主联军之间，发生了激战，据可靠消息，国民党军使用美国武器，美国飞机亦帮助国民党军轰炸民主联军，引起民主联军的极端愤慨。在三国外长莫斯科会议上，贝纳斯借口说美国对于执行日本投降条件，即对解除日军武装与遣送日人回国，担任主要的责任。贝纳斯声明只要这些责任执行完毕，或中国政府在执行此项责任不需要美国帮助时，美军即马上从中国撤退。可是，据中国与美国报纸的消息，美军在华北所给予的帮助是带有另一种性质，美军不是帮助国民党解除日军武装与遣送日军回国，而是帮助转送美国所训练与装备的国民党军队去与东北民主联军作战。纽约时报驻天津记者马丁报导：在华北凡是驻有美军的城市，仇视美军的情绪日益加强，美军军人不感觉他们是解放者，而感觉自己是征服者。马丁指出，美国兵士自己亦看清楚他们驻在中国不是为了军事的需要，而是有其政治原因，常常听到美军士兵声明，他们应当帮助蒋介石军进行内战，但当美军兵士知道国共两党于一月十日签订停战协定时，都声明说：“现在终于会叫我们回家了吧！”而中国人则声明：“美军撤兵后那就好了！”可是美军没有撤退。华盛顿邮报对此亦表焦虑称：“我们的军队何时从华北撤退，我们不能给予任何担保。”至于说到东北人民的意见，他们要求杜鲁门命令驻华美军司令部停止运输军队弹药援助中国内战，而应当执行美军自中国撤退的约许；但东北人民提出这些要求时，他们还不知道美国站在国民党方面直接干涉内战。"

    "content": "US President's Loan Policy\n    Winning Political Influence with Money\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th dispatch] Shanghai Airlines News: According to a United Press dispatch on the 12th, President Truman is planning to exchange US dollars for American political objectives. The United States originally planned to lend Poland 90 million US dollars, but it has now been stopped, reportedly because it requires the Polish government to see \"whether it intends to implement the 'political freedom' that is allowed.\" At the same time, US Treasury Secretary Vinson and French representative Blum are negotiating with the Export-Import Bank, and are expected to decide to release 650 million US dollars this week, plus war materials and other loans totaling 2.2 billion US dollars. However, the timing of this loan disbursement will maximize its impact on the French general election in June. Officials do not deny that the United States is doing this in an attempt to use the announcement of this loan to enhance the position of French Foreign Minister Bidault's Popular Republican Movement and Blum's Socialist Party in the general election, in order to counter the Communist Party. As far as China is concerned, the 500 million US dollar loan also has its direct political effect. This loan has already been prepared by the Export-Import Bank, ready to be paid out, but it is now suspended, because it is said that Truman has given special envoy Marshall the power of veto, so that the special envoy can \"act expediently\" in China.\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n杜鲁门  Dù Lǔmén (Truman)\n波兰    Bōlán (Poland)\n美国    Měiguó (United States)\n文森    Wén Sēn (Vinson)\n勃鲁姆  Bólǔmǔ (Blum)\n法国    Fǎguó (France)\n进出口银行  Jìnchūkǒu Yínháng (Export-Import Bank)\n比道尔  Bǐdào'ěr (Bidault)\n人民共和运动  Rénmín Gònghé Yùndòng (Popular Republican Movement)\n社会党  Shèhuìdǎng (Socialist Party)\n共产党  Gòngchǎndǎng (Communist Party)\n中国    Zhōngguó (China)\n马歇尔  Mǎxiē'ěr (Marshall)\n延安    Yan'an\n上海    Shanghai\n联合社    United Press\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美总统贷款方针  以金元赢得政治作用\n\n1946-05-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美总统贷款方针\n    以金元赢得政治作用\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】上海航讯：据联合社十二日电称：杜鲁门总统正拟以美元换取美国政治目的。美国原拟借给波兰九千万美元，但现已告停止。据说是要求波兰政府“是否有意实行所允许的‘政治自由’”。同时美财长文森及法国代表勃鲁姆，正在与进出口银行谈判，可望于本周内决定放出六亿五千万美元，加上战争物资及其他贷款共达二十二亿美元。但此项借款发放时间，当使其对法国六月间大选，发生最大作用。官场方面并不否认美国这样做，是企图借此借款之宣布，增强法外长比道尔之人民共和运动，及勃鲁姆之社会党在大选举中之地位，以与共产党相对抗。至于就中国而论，五亿美元借款亦有其直接政治作用。此项借款，本已由进出口银行备款，以待准备付出，现在却暂停未放，因为据说杜鲁门赋予马歇尔特使以否决权，以便特使在华“便宜行事”。"

He first discussed what situation British rule had created in India since its inception. He denied the Liberal MP Davies's claim that Britain had a glorious historical record in India. He said: \"There are 400 million people there, with all kinds of good mineral resources, but when the war broke out in 1939, India could not even manufacture tanks, and now famine is growing there again. Britain has not moved India forward; it has kept it in a low state of backwardness.\" Gallacher then spoke about the background of the British Cabinet Mission's publication of the White Paper. He said: \"We are faced with the fact that the old-style government has completely gone bankrupt, and India is in the midst of revolutionary ferment,\" therefore, \"when the Cabinet Mission went to India and the British Prime Minister said something about Indian independence, even the imperialist MPs sitting over there applauded.\" Gallacher then criticized the White Paper itself, saying: \"We see that someone is making detailed plans to help divide India, rather than unite it, and to win over the bourgeoisie to oppose the masses of the people.\" Gallacher opposed this policy of division, and then suggested immediately relieving the famine in India, declaring India's independence, withdrawing troops on a regular basis, and then negotiating with India on a truly equal basis, allowing the Indians to establish their own government, manage their own affairs, and abolish the princely states. He said: \"If you do this, you can get the great goodwill of the Indian people, and the Indian people will not oppose automatically uniting with us.\"\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n英国  United Kingdom\n英共  British Communist Party\n加拉契  Gallacher\n印度  India\n英阁使团  British Cabinet Mission\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n延安  Yan'an\n路透社  Reuters\n伦敦  London\n下院  House of Commons\n自由党  Liberal Party\n戴维斯  Davies\n英相  British Prime Minister\n白皮书  White Paper\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 英共议员加拉契演说  主张宣布印度独立  抨击英阁使团对印问题白皮书\n\n1946-05-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　英共议员加拉契演说\n    主张宣布印度独立\n    抨击英阁使团对印问题白皮书\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】据路透社伦敦讯：英下院讨论英阁使团对印问题的白皮书时，英共议员加拉契发表演说。他首先谈到英国统治印度以来使印度造成了什么形势，他否认自由党议员戴维斯所称英国对印度有光荣的历史成绩。他说：“那儿有四万万人口，有一切良好的矿物资源，然而在一九三九年战争爆发时，印度还不能制造坦克，而现在那里又增长着饥荒，英国没有使印度前进，她保持着低度的落后。”加拉契继谈到英阁使团发表白皮书的背景，他说：“我们面临这样的事实，即旧式的政府已完全破产，印度是处于革命的酝酿中”，因而“当内阁使团赴印、英相说了一些印度独立的话时，甚至坐在那边的帝国主义者议员们，也拍手起来。”加拉契继批评白皮书本身说：“我们看到有人正在作周密的计划，以帮助印度的分裂，而不是团结，并笼络资产阶级去反对人民群众。”加拉契反对这种分裂政策，继建议立即救济印度饥荒，宣布印度独立，定期撤兵，然后在真正平等基础上，与印度进行谈判，允许印度人成立自己的政府，管理自己的事情，废除藩邦王公。他说：“如果你这样做，你就可以得到印度人民的极大好意，而且印度人民也不会反对自动与我们联合了。”"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-05-27",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "[From our Changzhi correspondent] District cadres in LiCheng County held a meeting in mid-May to inspect the production situation since the start of spring plowing, and identified the main reasons for the current sluggishness of the movement. Since the spring plowing mobilization in March this year, the mutual aid teams throughout the county have been reorganized, resolving issues left over from last year such as unequal value exchange and uncleared accounts, and the movement has seen new development. More than ten villages have been able to organize activities based on farmers' own \"cultivate three, reserve one\" and \"cultivate two, reserve one\" plans. Cadres have begun to gain a new understanding of the principle of realizing \"cultivate three, reserve one.\" Villages along the Handan-Changzhi Road, through persuasion, mobilization, and specific organization, have gradually overcome the ideology of valuing commerce over agriculture. At the same time, the second and sixth districts, which have little land and poor soil and had no habit of engaging in sideline production in the past, have now begun to pay attention to organizing surplus labor for sideline production. Various villages have created many methods of combining agriculture and sideline production and distributing dividends based on equal value of labor. Based on this foundation, the county launched an unprecedentedly widespread wheat weeding campaign, with 71 percent of wheat fields weeded. Ten days after the rain, the county rushed to plant more than 36,300 mu of cotton, exceeding the original plan by more than 6,000 mu.\n    The main reason for the current sluggishness of the movement is that the leadership's understanding of the \"cultivate three, reserve one\" principle is very unspecific, and therefore the approach is also very superficial. For example, many cadres believe that \"universally achieving cultivate three, reserve one\" is just a slogan, \"that's what they say, but it's not necessarily what they do.\" They fail to see that \"organizing the masses\" is the guarantee for realizing \"cultivate three, reserve one,\" and simply emphasize the difficulties of material conditions such as thin soil, lack of by-products, and insufficient manpower. Another is blindly optimistic, only seeing the achievements of some advanced areas and emphasizing: \"Some people have already achieved cultivate three, reserve one last year, so this year is no problem.\" But they don't think of ways to further increase production. Secondly, there is a lack of overall understanding of the principle; either thinking that it is only to support poor peasants, and therefore only helping poor peasants and widows and widowers to make plans, or thinking that it is simply rewarding rich peasants, ignoring the support of poor tenant farmers. In short, the understanding of supporting poor peasants, developing middle peasants, and rewarding rich peasants is incomplete. In the implementation of \"cultivate three, reserve one,\" they often do not proceed from specific circumstances. For example, Zizhen was already able to achieve \"cultivate three, reserve one\" early on, but they still insisted that the masses make \"cultivate three, reserve one\" plans. Therefore, the masses reflected: \"We can achieve cultivate three, reserve one just by lying down.\" Some regard the promotion of improved varieties as the only way to increase production, and therefore mechanically promote improved varieties everywhere in mountainous areas. For example, the thin land of Huangcaozhan cannot even grow ordinary crops well, but they insist on promoting Golden Queen, which is opposed by the masses and therefore fails. Finally, the last point is that they do not regard the \"cultivate three, reserve one\" principle as a process of education and struggle, demanding too much and hoping that even the extremely poor can immediately achieve \"cultivate three, reserve one.\"\n    From the above situation inspection, the following practices were determined for the future: First, carry out specific leadership, not only helping the masses to make plans, but also carrying out specific organizational work according to different situations, helping to make plans on a seasonal basis and checking and promoting them at any time. Second, in order to turn the \"cultivate three, reserve one\" principle into a common idea and principle of the masses of all strata, it is necessary to universally carry out education on increasing production and getting rich, explaining that getting rich through production not only does not involve struggle, but also should be rewarded. Emphasis should be placed on local actual examples, praising and publicizing new-type rich peasants, establishing new banners, and educating the masses to recognize the glory of getting rich through production and the happiness of improving living standards.\n    After this inspection, the cadres of the whole county have determined to go deep into reality and implement the re-clarified principles and practices through sowing.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n黎城    Licheng\n长治    Changzhi\n邯长路  Handan-Changzhi Road\n子镇    Zizhen\n黄草沾  Huangcaozhan\n金皇后  Golden Queen\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 黎城检查春耕领导  具体贯彻“耕三余一”  加强组织工作，把生产提高一步。\n\n1946-05-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　黎城检查春耕领导\n    具体贯彻“耕三余一” \n    加强组织工作，把生产提高一步。\n    【本报长治讯】黎城县区干部，五月中旬召开会议检查了春耕以来的生产情况，找出了当前运动迟滞的主要原因。从今年三月份的春耕动员后，全县的互助组经过了重新整顿，解决了去年遗留下的不等价、没有算清账等问题，运动有了新的开展；有十多个村，已经能依据农户自己的“耕三余一”、“耕二余一”计划组织活动，干部对实现耕三余一的方针，开始有了新的了解。邯长路沿线村庄，经过说服动员和具体组织，重商轻农的思想，已逐渐克服。同时土地少且坏的二、六区，过去没有搞副业习惯，现在也开始注意组织剩余劳动力进行副业生产。各村创造了不少农业副业结合和变工等价分红办法。以此为基础，全县开展了空前普遍的锄麦运动，麦田百分之七十一都锄过，雨后十天，全县突击种棉三万六千三百多亩，超过原定计划六千多亩。\n    当前运动迟滞的主要原因是领导上对耕三余一的方针的了解很不具体，因而在作法上也很不深入，如许多干部认为“普遍达到耕三余一”只是一个口号，“叫是这样叫，可不一定这样做。”看不到群众“组织起来”就是实现“耕三余一”的保证，单纯强调土地薄、缺副产、人力不够等物质条件的困难。另一种却是盲目乐观，只看到一些先进地区的成绩就强调：“去年有的就已经做到耕三余一了，今年不成问题。”而不想办法进一步增产。其次是对方针缺乏全盘的认识；或者认为仅是扶植贫农，因而只帮助贫农、鳏寡订计划，或者又认为是单纯奖励富农，忽视扶植贫佃农。总之，对扶植贫农，发展中农，奖励富农的认识不完整。在对“耕三余一”的执行上，也往往不从具体情况出发，如子镇“耕三余一”已早能做到，还硬要群众订“耕三余一”计划，因此群众反映说：“耕三余一咱躺下也能达到了。”有的把推广优良品种当做增产的唯一办法，因而机械的在山地也到处推广优良品种，如黄草沾的薄地连一般庄稼还长不好而硬去推广金皇后，遭群众反对，因而失败。最后一点是没有把“耕三余一”的方针当作一个教育和奋斗的过程，要求过高，对赤贫也希望他立即达到“耕三余一”。\n    从以上情况的检查中，确定了今后的作法：第一，是进行具体领导，不单单是帮助群众订计划，而且要按照不同情况进行具体的组织工作，随时帮助按季订计划并检查推动，第二，要把“耕三余一”的方针变成各阶层群众的共同思想与方针，就必须普遍进行增产发家的教育，说明生产致富不仅不斗争，而且还要奖励，应着重以当地实际例子，表扬与宣传新型富农，树立新的旗帜，教育群众，认识生产致富的光荣和生活改善的幸福。\n    全县干部经过这一检查，已决心深入实际通过下种，把重新明确了的方针与作法贯彻下去。"

Firouz stated: \"Some of the statements made by Ala do not represent the views of the Iranian government. The government has not given him such instructions, and therefore this statement and other similar statements represent only his personal opinions. Ala has now received instructions from the Prime Minister that he must not issue such statements again.\" According to reports, at the Security Council on the 22nd, Ala claimed that Soviet troops were still interfering in Iran's internal affairs and falsely alleged that Soviet troops remained in Azerbaijan and armed the \"rebels\" of Azerbaijan (i.e., the democratic elements in Azerbaijan province demanding autonomy). British and American representatives then used this as an excuse to obstruct the continuation of the so-called Iranian issue on the agenda. Firouz's above statement shows that Ala's remarks were clearly rumors, and the reasons for the British and American representatives' obstruction are groundless.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd Dispatch] The Security Council held a meeting on the 19th to discuss the Soviet-Iranian issue. US Representative Stettinius still claimed that although Soviet troops did withdraw from Azerbaijan on May 6, it was not the end, and therefore the Iranian issue could not be removed from the Security Council's agenda. (Note: The Iranian government had previously announced that \"the Iranian mission, after arriving in Azerbaijan province, confirmed that Soviet troops had withdrawn as scheduled.\") Soviet Representative Gromyko did not attend the meeting. Polish Representative Lange opposed Stettinius's opinion, saying: \"The Security Council should accept the Iranian Prime Minister's statement.\" Iranian reactionary Ambassador to the United States, Ala, speaking at the time, still echoed British and American opinions, falsely claiming that \"Soviet troops only withdrew from Azerbaijan after May 6.\" At the insistence of the United States and Britain, the meeting passed Stettinius's proposal to keep the Iranian issue on the agenda and postpone discussion. Stettinius's reason for insisting was that the Iranian government's announcement only concerned Azerbaijan province. According to Ala's report at the Security Council's second discussion of the Iranian issue on the 8th of this month, \"Official news from Tehran confirms that Soviet troops have withdrawn from all areas except Azerbaijan province, which has not yet been confirmed.\" Based on this, Stettinius's reason for insisting is clearly for other purposes.\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n伊朗  Iran\n苏尔丹尼  Soltaninejad\n弗鲁兹  Firouz\n阿塞拜疆  Azerbaijan\n德黑兰  Tehran\n艾拉  Ala\n安理会  Security Council\n美国  United States\n英国  Britain\n苏联  Soviet Union\n斯退丁纽斯  Stettinius\n葛罗米柯  Gromyko\n波兰  Poland\n兰吉  Lange\n延安  Yan'an\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n合众社  United Press International\n路透社  Reuters\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 伊总理发言人声明  内政不难和平解决  斥艾拉附和英美意见诬蔑苏联\n\n1946-05-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　伊总理发言人声明\n    内政不难和平解决\n    斥艾拉附和英美意见诬蔑苏联\n    【新华社延安二十日电】合众社德黑兰讯：伊朗总理苏尔丹尼的发言人，弗鲁兹亲王宣称：伊朗中央军与阿塞拜疆自治联邦间的冲突，虽未停止，但他预料阿塞拜疆问题能及早解决，并强调伊政府对和平解决的愿望。\n    【新华社延安二十五日电】德黑兰讯：调查阿塞拜疆边界冲突的阿塞拜疆代表团已达德黑兰，并与伊政府委派的代表合组委员会，出发边境进行调查。\n    【新华社延安二十五日电】路透社德黑兰讯：伊朗政府发言人弗鲁兹亲王，昨日晚在招待记者席上，正式否认伊朗驻美大使艾拉向安理会所发之声明，弗鲁兹称：“艾拉所作的一些声明，并不能代表伊朗政府的意见，政府没有给他这样的训令，因此他的这一声明及其他类似的声明，都仅仅是代表他个人的意见而已。艾拉现已获得总理的训令以后，不得再发表此类声明”。按二十二日安理会上，艾拉曾声称苏军仍在伊朗干涉内政，并造谣称：苏军仍留住阿塞拜疆，并武装阿的“叛乱者”（即阿省要求自治的民主分子），美英代表当时即借此留难将所谓伊朗问题继续留在议程上。弗鲁兹上述声明，说明艾拉之发言显系造谣，而美英代表留难之理由，毫无根据。\n    【新华社延安二十三日电】安理会十九日举行会议，讨论苏伊问题，美代表斯退丁纽斯仍称：苏军确于五月六日自阿塞拜疆撤退，但并非结束，因而伊朗问题不能自安理会议程上取消（按伊政府前此曾公布称：“伊朗使团抵阿省后证实苏军已如期撤毕”），苏代表葛罗米柯未出席会议。波兰代表兰吉反对斯退丁纽斯的意见，他说：“安理会应接受伊总理的声明”。伊反动派驻美大使艾拉发言时，仍附和英美意见，诬称：“苏军在五月六日以后方撤离阿塞拜疆”。会议在美英坚持下，通过斯退丁纽斯的提案，将伊朗问题继续留在议程上，展期讨论。斯氏坚持之理由，是伊政府之公布，只涉及阿省。按本月八日，安理会二次讨论伊朗问题时，艾拉之报告，曾称：“德黑兰官方消息，除阿省尚未证实外，其他各地苏军俱已撤退”。据此则斯氏所坚持之理由，显系别有用意。"

    "content": "Ji-Lu-Yu and Ji'nan Regions\n    Printing and Publishing Industries are Flourishing           \n    Nearly Twenty Newspapers and Magazines Published\n    [Our Correspondent in Heze] The printing industry in the Ji-Lu-Yu region has been developing rapidly since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The predecessor of the Ji-Lu-Yu Printing Factory was the Ji-Lu-Yu Bookstore. The factory originally had three lithographic presses and one quarto letterpress. Now it has developed to nine letterpresses, thirteen lithographic presses, and one electric lithographic press, with a capital amount of 35 million yuan. The factory prints 18,000 copies of the Ji-Lu-Yu Daily every day. From June last year to the end of the year, it published 500,000 copies of winter school textbooks, 100,000 copies of primary school textbooks, and hundreds of thousands of copies of propaganda materials. The second largest is the War Comrade Newspaper, which was founded in 1937. Initially, it was a small mimeographed newspaper, then changed to a lithographic newspaper, and in 1945 it was changed to letterpress. The scale is relatively large, with a circulation of over 4,000 copies per issue. The newspaper currently has two foot-operated presses, one lithographic press, and one small octavo press. It has now published over 200 issues. The newspaper also publishes the War Comrade Tri-Weekly, War Comrade Anthology, War Comrade Pictorial, Cultural Life and other publications. In terms of newspapers, there are also the Jinan Daily, a quarto letterpress recently published in Jinan City, as well as the Second Military Sub-district's Advance Newspaper, the Huxi Masses Newspaper, the First Military Sub-district's Beacon Fire Newspaper, and the Fifth Military Sub-district's Masses Newspaper.\n    [Our Correspondent in Weixian] The cultural publishing and printing industry in the Ji'nan region has achieved great success. Currently, the entire region publishes four kinds of news newspapers, including the Ji'nan Daily, Unity Newspaper, Iron Current Newspaper, and Pioneer Newspaper. There are four kinds of regular publications, including the Worker-Peasant-Soldier Bi-Monthly, North Feng Bi-Monthly, Masses Communication Quarterly, and Ji'nan People's Collection. There are bookstores including the Ji'nan Bookstore, Lu Northwest Bookstore, Masses Bookstore, Nangong Bookstore, and Pingyuan Bookstore, all of which have attached printing factories. In addition, there is the Ji'nan Administrative Office Printing Factory and many other small-scale farmer reading material printing factories scattered throughout the region. The Ji'nan Daily is a local newspaper in Ji'nan, originally lithographic, with a circulation of 6,000 copies. It was changed to letterpress on New Year's Day this year and has been distributed to 13,000 copies. Since the change to letterpress, a total of 538,000 copies have been distributed. In addition to printing newspapers, the newspaper's printing factory also prints books and undertakes the printing of announcements, averaging 1,700 copies per day. The Ji'nan Bookstore was established on New Year's Day this year and has three letterpresses and two lithographic presses. Since its establishment, it has published 16 kinds of cadre reading materials, 52,000 copies of the Worker-Peasant-Soldier Bi-Monthly, 10,000 copies of textbooks, and 50,000 copies of junior high school textbooks. The Ji'nan Administrative Office Printing Factory has two foot-operated letterpresses and six lithographic presses. It mainly prints primary school textbooks. From January to March of this year alone, it printed eight primary school textbooks, totaling 74,810 copies, and four kinds of cadre reading materials, totaling 5,000 copies. Each other special district has its own special district printing factory for printing textbooks.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\nOrganizations\n\n冀鲁豫印刷厂 Ji-Lu-Yu Printing Factory\n冀鲁豫书店 Ji-Lu-Yu Bookstore\n战友报社   Zhan You Bao She (War Comrade Newspaper)\n济宁日报   Jining Ribao\n挺进报     Tingjin Bao (Advance Newspaper)\n湖西大众报   Huxi Dazhong Bao (Huxi Masses Newspaper)\n烽火报     Fenghuo Bao (Beacon Fire Newspaper)\n群众报     Qunzhong Bao (Masses Newspaper)\n冀南日报   Ji'nan Ribao\n团结报     Tuanjie Bao (Unity Newspaper)\n铁流报     Tieliubao (Iron Current Newspaper)\n先锋报     Xianfeng Bao (Pioneer Newspaper)\n工农兵半月刊  Gong Nong Bing Banyuekan (Worker-Peasant-Soldier Bi-Monthly)\n北丰半月刊  Beifeng Banyuekan\n大众通讯季刊  Dazhong Tongxun Jikan (Masses Communication Quarterly)\n冀南民汇    Ji'nan Min Hui\n冀南书店   Ji'nan Shudian (Ji'nan Bookstore)\n鲁西北书店  Lu Xibei Shudian (Lu Northwest Bookstore)\n大众书店   Dazhong Shudian (Masses Bookstore)\n南宫书店   Nangong Shudian\n平原书店   Pingyuan Shudian\n冀南行署印刷厂 Ji'nan Administrative Office Printing Factory\n\nPublications\n\n战友三日刊   Zhan You San Ri Kan (War Comrade Tri-Weekly)\n战友文选   Zhan You Wenxuan (War Comrade Anthology)\n战友画报   Zhan You Huabao (War Comrade Pictorial)\n文化生活   Wenhua Shenghuo (Cultural Life)\n\nPlaces\n\n荷泽      Heze\n冀鲁豫区  Ji-Lu-Yu Qu (Ji-Lu-Yu Region)\n冀南区    Ji'nan Qu (Ji'nan Region)\n济宁市  Jining Shi (Jining City)\n威县      Weixian\n鲁西北    Lu Xibei (Lu Northwest)\n南宫      Nangong\n平原      Pingyuan\n湖西      Huxi\n\nNumerical Terms\n\n三千五百万元  35 million yuan\n一万八千份   18,000 copies\n五十万册     500,000 copies\n十万册       100,000 copies\n几十万份     hundreds of thousands of copies\n四千余份     over 4,000 copies\n二百期       200 issues\n六千份       6,000 copies\n一万三千份   13,000 copies\n五十三万八千份 538,000 copies\n一千七百册   1,700 copies\n五万二千册   52,000 copies\n一万册       10,000 copies\n五万册       50,000 copies\n七万四千八百一十本 74,810 copies\n五千册       5,000 copies\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫、冀南两区  印刷出版业日益发展  共出报纸杂志近二十种\n\n1946-05-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀鲁豫、冀南两区\n    印刷出版业日益发展           \n    共出报纸杂志近二十种\n    【本报荷泽讯】冀鲁豫区印刷业，自抗战胜利后，日益发展。冀鲁豫印刷厂的前身为冀鲁豫书店，该厂原有石印机三部，四开铅印机一部，现已发展到九部铅印机，十三部石印机，一部电力石印机，资金数额为三千五百万元。该厂每日印刷冀鲁豫日报一万八千份，书籍出版从去年六月起至年底共出版冬学课本五十万册，小学课本十万册，及宣传品几十万份。其次为战友报社，该社创始于一九三七年，初为小型油印报，后改为石印报，四五年改为铅印，规模较大，报纸每期发行四千余份。该社现有脚蹬机两架，石印机一架，小八开机一架，现已出版到二百期以上，该社并出版战友三日刊，战友文选，战友画报，文化生活等数种刊物。报纸方面，还有济宁市最近出版的铅印四开济宁日报，暨二分区挺进报，湖西大众报，一分区烽火报，五分区群众报等报纸。\n    【本报威县讯】冀南区的文化出版印刷事业，已获得很大成绩，现全区出版计有冀南日报、团结报、铁流报、先锋报等四种新闻报。定期刊物计有工农兵半月刊、北丰半月刊、大众通讯季刊、冀南民汇等四种。书店计有冀南书店、鲁西北书店、大众书店、南宫书店、平原书店等，均附设印刷厂，此外尚有冀南行署印刷厂以及其他散处于各地之小规模农民读物印刷厂甚多。冀南日报为冀南地方报，原为石印，发行额达六千份，本年元旦改为铅印，已发行至一万三千份。自改铅印后，共发行五十三万八千份。该报印刷厂除印刷报纸外，并印有书籍及承印布告等，平均每日印一千七百册。冀南书店系今年元旦成立，有铅印机三架，石印机二架，自成立后，已出版干部读物十六种，工农兵半月刊共出版五万二千册，教科书一万册，初中课本五万册。冀南行署印刷厂有脚蹬铅印机二架，石印机六架，主要是印刷小学课本，仅本年一月至三月，共印小学课本八册，计七万四千八百一十本，印干部读物四种，共五千册。其他各专区都设专区印刷厂，印刷课本。"

    "content": "[Our Yangcheng News] Since the county-wide 30,000-person Speak Bitterness and Revenge rally in Yicheng on February 11th, the flames of Speak Bitterness and Revenge have been ignited throughout the county. After the breakthrough in the East and West Stone Bridge area of the first district, the struggle quickly spread to seven or eight villages. The Speak Bitterness and Revenge meeting in the second district had a total of 27,000 people in the district, reaching 20,000 participants; the masses from Fushan and Qinshui also traveled long distances to participate. Other districts also universally launched joint struggles, with 120,000 people in the county throwing themselves into the torrent of revenge. They cried, clenched their fists, and shouted: \"Repay hatred with hatred, avenge grievances with grievances,\" \"Unite and stand up!\" By mid-March, most villages in the third and second districts had completed rent reduction and debt clearance. Villages such as Guanzhuang in the third district began to organize mutual aid teams. According to statistics from nine villages in the second district, 2,434 cases of rent and interest issues were resolved. The first and fourth districts are now deeply engaged in rent reduction and debt clearance. According to statistics from 36 villages, farmers who had lost their land have obtained over 700 mu of irrigated land, over 12,500 mu of dry land, and 6,154 shi of grain in the struggle. After obtaining this land and grain, most of the farmers have risen in status. For example, 178 poor households in Yaodu Village have now risen to the status of middle peasants; 15 tenant households have risen to the status of middle peasants. As the struggle develops, the political awareness of the masses has also increased. During this election of National Assembly representatives, the masses universally reflected: \"We must elect our own people to represent our own interests.\" All the people of Xixiaping Village submitted eight proposals to the National Assembly, the first of which was to demand the universal implementation of rent reduction and interest rate reduction nationwide. In the villages that have been mobilized, farmers have successively established their own organizations, formed peasant associations and militias, and transformed village political power. The reason why the mass movement here can develop so rapidly is, first, because the policy of boldly relaxing control and trusting the wisdom of the masses has been implemented. Secondly, the leaders everywhere support the masses and organize large-scale joint struggles. Thirdly, the forces are concentrated. In addition to more than 100 cadres in the county, there are also more than 50 members of the Taiyue Administrative Office work team. In terms of the forms of struggle, there are the following: (1) Those organized and struggled automatically by the masses, such as Yaodu Village, which was led by the village's active members Zhang Bingyan and Zhang Fengx from beginning to end. (2) Those where work team cadres go to the village to discover active members and collude with the masses to rise up in struggle. (3) In villages where special agent activities are rampant, the work team can't find out anything after arriving in the village. At that time, they suppressed the special agents on one hand, enlightened the masses' struggle emotions; on the other hand, they carefully discovered active members, secretly brewed collusion, and gradually turned to open struggle. (4) In the old liberated areas, rents had been reduced, but it was not thorough in practice, and special agents secretly engaged in activities. The masses carried out rent reduction and debt clearance in the anti-special agent campaign. (5) As for the Hexi area of the fourth district, first concentrate forces on the Xixiaping base point. On the other hand, look for active members in the surrounding villages to participate in the base point struggle and learn from the experience. Then disperse and return to each village to launch the struggle.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n翼城\tYicheng\n阳城\tYangcheng\n东西石桥  Dongxi Shiqiao\n浮山\tFushan\n沁水\tQinshui\n尧都\tYaodu\n张丙彦\tZhang Bingyan\n张凤×\tZhang Fengx\n关庄\tGuanzhuang\n西下坪\tXixiaping\n太岳行署\tTaiyue Administrative Office\n国大  National Assembly\n有仇报仇，有冤报冤  Repay hatred with hatred, avenge grievances with grievances\n团结起来翻身  Unite and stand up\nSpeak Bitterness and Revenge\t诉苦复仇\n农会  Peasant Association\n民兵  Militia\n减租清债  Rent reduction and debt clearance\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 十二万人齐翻身  翼城群运迅速普遍  领导上大胆放手集中力量干广大农民收回土地努力生产\n\n1946-05-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　十二万人齐翻身\n    翼城群运迅速普遍\n    领导上大胆放手集中力量干广大农民收回土地努力生产\n    【本报阳城讯】翼城自二月十一日全县三万人诉苦复仇大会后，便燃起了全县诉苦复仇的火焰。一区东西石桥突破后，斗争很快普遍到七、八个村子。二区的诉苦复仇会，全区共两万七千人，便到了两万人，浮山、沁水的群众，也远道赶来参加。其他各区也普遍展开了联合斗争，全县十二万人，投入了复仇巨浪中，他们流着眼泪，握着拳头，高喊：“有仇报仇，有冤报冤”，“团结起来翻身”。至三月中旬，全县八十四个行政村，发动起来八十个。四月底，三、二区大部村子减租清债已结束，三区关庄等村，开始组织互助大队，据二区九个村统计，解决租息问题二千四百三十四件。一、四区现在深入减租清债，据三十六个村统计，失掉土地的农民，在斗争中取得水地七百余亩，旱地一万二千五百余亩，粮食六千一百五十四石。农民得到这些土地粮食后，大部都上升了，如尧都村一百七十八户贫农，现已上升为中农；十五户佃户，上升为中农。随着斗争开展，群众政治觉悟亦提高了。这次选举国大代表时，群众普遍反映：“要选咱自己人，才能代表自己利益。”西下坪村的全体老百姓，向国大提出八个提案，其中头一款，就是要求全国普遍实行减租减息。已经发动起来的村子，农民纷纷建立起自己的组织，成立农会民兵，改造村政权。这里群运所以能开展的如此迅速，首先是执行了大胆放手的方针，相信群众智慧。其次领导上到处给群众撑腰，组织大规模的联合斗争。再次是力量集中，除本县一百多干部外，尚有太岳行署工作队五十余人。在斗争形式上，有如下几种：（一）是由群众自动组织起来斗争的，如尧都村自始至终是本村积极分子张丙彦、张凤×领导的。（二）是由工作队干部到村中发现积极分子，串通群众起来斗争的。（三）是村中特务活动厉害，工作队到村后啥也问不出，当时一面镇压特务，启发群众斗争情绪；另方面细心发现积极分子，秘密酝酿串通，逐渐转入公开斗争。（四）是老解放区，曾减过租，实际并不彻底，特务暗地活动，群众在反特务中进行减租清债。（五）如四区河西一类，先集中力量在西下坪基点，另方面在周围村寻找积极分子参加基点斗争，学习经验。然后分散回各村去，开展斗争。"

    "content": "Ningwu and Jiaocheng Areas\n    Restore Forestry Logging\n    Jiaocheng's Income Reaches Over 20 Million Yuan in Three Months\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 21st Dispatch] Forestry in Jiaocheng and Ningwu, which had been suspended for many years, has now resumed logging and is organizing large-scale exports. The Trade Bureau has set up timber and medicinal herb purchasing offices in the mountainous areas of Jiaocheng, extensively organizing the masses to gather resources. There are over 500 people in large labor exchange teams who have signed contracts with the Trade Bureau for regular logging. There are also many smaller labor exchange teams. From January to April, the income from timber sold to other areas reached over 20 million yuan. Medicinal herbs are the second most important sideline product in the area, generating substantial profits as well. The Ningwu Timber Management Committee began organizing logging last month, with over 1,000 laborers participating in this production. Measures are being taken to absorb public and private capital, organize limited liability joint-stock companies, promote labor-capital cooperation (using labor to offset capital contributions), and encourage the masses to freely organize cooperatives. The Forestry Management Committee is actively conducting registration and organizational work, with many people coming to register from various mountains. To prevent indiscriminate logging and protect the forests, the government has also sent specialists to provide guidance in the logging areas. Before the war, timber was an important product for the people of Ningwu and Jiaocheng. There were dozens of factories engaged in timber logging.

According to Reuters, \"This strike not only paralyzes national transportation and creates a food shortage crisis, but will also cripple the entire industry and commerce.\" Only one day into the strike, serious consequences have already arisen in the United States. United Press International reported on the 24th: Coal production was greatly hampered today due to the railway strike. Because coal cars cannot be dispatched due to the railway strike, 90 percent of the bituminous coal industry will shut down by nightfall. After the railway strike began, President Truman immediately convened an emergency meeting of senior cabinet members on the 24th to discuss the crisis facing the United States due to the strike. Truman also ordered Eisenhower to shorten his stay in Georgia and return to Washington quickly to convene an emergency meeting, and requested the Senate and House of Representatives to convene a joint session on the 25th to hear the President's message on the current serious situation. At the same time, police in cities such as New York have been urgently dispatched to prevent any disturbances, while the government is desperately concentrating aircraft, trucks, and ships to prepare for emergencies.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th] Washington dispatch: 400,000 US coal miners are scheduled to resume their major strike tomorrow.

    "content": "Review of New Life\n    Zeng Ke\n    In May, the season when new life flourishes, the children of the Fourth District of Wuxiang held a grand competition of new heroism.\n    The day after Labor Day, thousands of children, who had survived the severe suffering of war and famine, arrived at Yaozhuang early.\n    The children were scattered on the river beach, on the hillside, in the meadow; the red and white, blue and white student caps on their heads glittered in the golden sunlight; their smiling red cheeks were more beautiful than flowers!\n    With a loud whistle, the children, like a torrent, immediately gathered on the square on the east bank of the small river. The national flag and award flags fluttered in the clear sky. Countless slogan signs, with the power of encouragement, beckoned to the children under the flag shadows. Twenty or thirty young teachers, each with a kind smile on their faces, were busy organizing the children's formations and conducting songs. Lu Gaixiang, a female teacher from Wangzhuanggou Primary School, arranged resting and eating places for her students like a mother, her face covered in sweat, still stroking the children's heads and wiping their sweat! Wang Huan'an, a teacher from Xichuan Village Primary School, leaning on his high crutches, walked back and forth with great difficulty. With the same enthusiasm and sense of responsibility he had when he was a militiaman, he did not regret the leg he had lost in the war, dedicating his disabled life entirely to the work of cultivating revolutionary descendants.\n    The meeting began. When the bright music stopped, the whole venue was silent, thousands of chattering little mouths were tightly closed. Thousands of pairs of dark and bright little eyes were focused on the stage. War had not only taught them to endure hardship and stand hard work, but had also given them the best training in discipline and organization. Thus, the chairman's loud speech was imprinted word by word in their keen little minds:\n    \"...If it wasn't for the victory of the War of Resistance, we couldn't have had such a grand meeting. If it wasn't for the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, our poor children would not have the right to education. In the past seven or eight years, too many children in our district have died. According to incomplete statistics, Chang'le, a small village on the Linpan Wu River beach, lost more than forty from starvation and murder.\" He raised his voice and said again:\n    \"We have not been intimidated by this cruel situation, we have become more determined and courageous. We have not forgotten to study in the mountain gullies and wilderness, even when we were hungry. A blackboard was hung on a tree branch, and we moved a few earthen clods on the ground to learn to read and listen to politics...\"\n    A roar of slogans, like thunder, echoed from below the stage. Thousands of little fists were waved powerfully:\n    --Continue our fighting spirit! Avenge our dead brothers and sisters!\n    The atmosphere of the meeting was constantly changing with the chairman's speech. When the chairman recounted the deeds of some heroic children who had sacrificed themselves, everyone's emotions changed from enthusiasm to solemnity. They lowered their little heads, some shedding tears. They were immersed in painful memories. Who could forget the disasters suffered in the past eight years, and who could forget the catastrophe brought by the enemy's occupation of Panlong for more than eight months! Which family had not lost relatives? Whose chickens, dogs, cattle, and sheep had not been driven to extinction? Now, their little hearts, full of bloodstains, were again occupied by that tragic scene. As soon as the chairman mentioned Baijiazhuang, only three miles away from Panlong, everyone immediately remembered the twelve-year-old fellow sufferer Li Aimin. His words in front of the enemy, as described by the villagers who had run back from the enemy, echoed clearly in everyone's ears:\n    \"Little kid, where are you from?\" the enemy asked.\n    A firm reply:\n    \"Chinese.\"\n    \"Tell us, where are the militiamen? Where are the cave dwellings where the people are fleeing? Take us to dig up grain!\" The enemy pointed his gun at the children's chests, ordering them.\n    The child stood calmly and said nothing.\n    A puppet soldier came up and said enticingly:\n    \"Take the Imperial Army there! After that, we'll let you go back!\"\n    \"Don't forget, you are also Chinese!\" the child shouted loudly, glaring with angry eyes:\n    The Japanese also shouted:\n    \"Little Eighth Routers! Die die die!\"\n    \"You bastard, you're asking for death. I'm giving you a way out and you don't want it. Speak quickly, or I'll kill you.\" The puppet soldier cursed and kicked the child.\n    \"Chinese are not afraid to die! The people are all Eighth Route Army!\"\n    Before the last syllable of the child's roar was finished, the enemy's bayonet had pierced his left temple. He fell in a pool of blood with unyielding eyes.\n    After recounting this passage, the chairman changed his mournful tone and finally encouraged everyone:\n    \"Now, the Japanese devils have been driven away by us. We must seize the time to learn various skills and strive for complete peace and build a new society!\"\n    With a burst of thunderous applause, the drills, singing, and recreational competitions began. Each village, regardless of the number of people, marched in such orderly steps. The children who shouted the commands were all full of energy and vigor, hoping to win the new heroism honor and reward, saluting the rostrum and looking at the viewers with smiles. Among the twenty or thirty kinds of recreational performances, the \"dressing\" drill of the Jing Primary School was the most novel and lively. The attention of the whole venue was focused on a dozen children who had taken off their coats, trousers, and socks. With an urgent whistle from the teacher, they calmly and quickly followed the order in which the clothes were arranged, competing to put them on neatly first. At this time, the audience applauded and discussed:\n    \"See how fast! The enemy has trained our children and adults to be capable these past few years! Children as young as four or five years old can do this so quickly when they hear there is a situation in the middle of the night!\"\n    The performance of the Chang'le Village singing about the sacrifice of the Forty-Eighth Martyrs was also a scene that won the praise of the whole venue. The women, with snow-white towels wrapped around their heads, used mournful tones to convey this unfortunate news to the people of the whole venue.\n    After checking the cleanliness and hygiene, the teams went to visit the achievement exhibition hall in the temple west of the river. Three houses were filled. The walls were nailed with jujube thorns, displaying the best achievements in large and small characters, drawings, etc. Diaries, compositions, arithmetic assignments, and bright and neat covers emitted tempting light to those who came. The working children were recording and praising their working life! A child wrote in her diary about her mother: \"My mother works hard all day long, pushing the millstone and grinding grain. At night, after I fall asleep, she still sits under the small oil lamp and sews clothes for me. The next morning, when I wake up, my mother is grinding grain again, and my new clothes are already made and placed by my pillow!\" Their feelings are as real and simple as their lives. Every article praised the new life and the Eighth Route Army. Under the title of \"Poor Peasants Overturn Their Lives,\" they expressed their love and gratitude to the Communist Party. They wrote letters to the soldiers at the front, examined their thoughts on serving the masses, and in their work and drawings, most of them were models of agricultural tools: small plows, small spinning wheels, clay cattle, mules, and also the Martyrs' Memorial Pavilion, pictures made of wheat straw, showing the beauty of folk art!\n    After the evaluation by the evaluation committee and the children's representatives, Quebian Village and Daobian Village won the championship and runner-up in the total score, and all others were rewarded.\n    The next day, the hero models selected by each school on Children's Day exchanged experiences. One loud voice after another spread across the venue. Production models, some introduced themselves, some introduced each other. They achieved self-sufficiency in coal carrying, shoe making, and making books and stationery. Hao Jiuyun from Panlong stood in front of the stage, gesticulating with his small hands, and said like a speech:\n    \"I raised two pigs for the school, and every day after class, I went to Panlong Street to pour out the sweet water. Now, I have a litter of chickens, and in the future, I will be able to raise four pigs, and I won't have to rely on my family for food and drink!\"\n    Everyone unanimously elected him as the district's production model.\n    Zao Yan Wang Juze, this twelve or thirteen year old, very beautiful little girl, used her clear voice to introduce her experience in promoting health work:\n    \"I wash my face twice a day, change my clothes frequently, and also check on my classmates, and help neighboring women pay attention to hygiene!\"\n    Among the learning models, the learning spirit and achievements of Li Wenning, a mute from Mailuoshen Village, won the praise of the whole venue after being introduced by a primary school student on his behalf. He relied on physical cues every day and could recognize and write three characters.\n    Wang Zhaolong from Bao Ruzhuang was selected as the district's health model because of his regular diet and lack of illness for four or five years.\n    The competition for model little teachers was the most enthusiastic. Finally, Wang Yongan from Chang'le won the top prize for being the most capable of mastering his classmates and taking on the responsibility of a teacher.\n    Hao Mengdong from Longtuan squeezed out his short, fat body from the crowd, and said with a smile:\n    \"The classmates chose me as the entertainment model. My ability is to make everyone happy, cheerful, and in good spirits. At school, I organize various games. When I am tired of reading and writing, I think of ways to cheer everyone up.

The statement declared: \"Major war criminals still occupy key positions in state institutions, hindering Japan's democratization.\" The statement demanded a new election of the parliament, severe punishment of war criminals, and issued a warning to the world, pointing out that \"the current situation in Japan is facilitating reactionaries in burying the seeds of disrupting future Pacific peace,\" appealing to the Allied nations to closely monitor the situation in Japan. On the 20th, major newspapers in Tokyo all rose up to accuse the newly appointed Speaker of the House of Representatives, Tadayoshi Miki (Liberal Party), and Vice-Speaker Kimura (Progressive Party) of being war criminals. According to reports, Miki served as the president of the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun during the war, and the newspaper vehemently supported the war. Miki also served in the wartime Cabinet Information Bureau and the Greater Japan Political Association's Asia Development Department. The newspapers also published the speech by JCP leader Kyuichi Tokuda when attending the opening ceremony of the new parliament, exposing that the current parliament is \"a place for reactionaries to carry out anti-democratic conspiracies, and among them are many disguised war criminals.\" The newspapers revealed that after Tokuda's speech, reactionary members of parliament dispatched representatives to hold secret meetings, plotting to attack JCP members of parliament. Regarding the nature of the current Japanese parliament, the Soviet Red Star newspaper pointed out: \"The majority of members in this parliament oppose the establishment of genuine democracy in the country, and this parliament is an obstacle to the further democratization of Japan.\"\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n新华社    Xinhua News Agency\n延安  Yan'an\n日本共产党  Japanese Communist Party\n议会    Parliament\n麦克阿瑟  MacArthur\n东京    Tokyo\n三木忠吉  Tadayoshi Miki\n自由党  Liberal Party\n木村  Kimura\n进步党  Progressive Party\n报知新闻社  Hochi Shimbun\n内阁情报局  Cabinet Information Bureau\n大政翼赞会  Greater Japan Political Association\n兴亚部  Asia Development Department\n德田球一  Kyuichi Tokuda\n苏联红星报  Soviet Red Star newspaper\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 日共主张改选议会  谴责多数议员曾与军部合作，从事侵略战争，将阻碍日本民主化。\n\n1946-05-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　日共主张改选议会\n    谴责多数议员曾与军部合作，从事侵略战争，将阻碍日本民主化。\n    【新华社延安二十五日电】东京讯：日共于二十一日发表声明，痛斥“议会”，谴责议员中绝大多数是“曾与军部合作，从事侵略战争的反动分子”，指出有八十余名议员，按麦克阿瑟的清洗命令，应禁止任公职。该声明宣称：“尚有大的战犯盘踞国家机构要津，阻碍日本民主化。”该声明要求从新改选议会，严惩战犯，并向全世界发出警号，指出“今天日本的局势，正便利了反动派埋下搅乱未来太平洋和平的火种”，呼吁盟国密切注视日本形势。二十日，东京各大报纸均纷起指责新任众议会议长三木忠吉（自由党）和副议长木村（进步党）均系战犯。按三木战时曾任东京报知新闻社总裁，该报激烈支持战争。三木并曾任职战时内阁情报局及大政翼赞会兴亚部。各报并刊载日共领袖德田球一于出席新议会开幕典礼时的演说，揭发此次议会为“反动派贯彻反民主阴谋的场所，在他们之中有许多是经过伪装了的战犯”。各报透露德田演说后，反动议员们曾推派代表举行秘密会议，阴谋打击日共议员。对日本本届议会性质，苏联红星报指出：“这届议会中大多数议员，都反对在国内建立真正的民主，本届议会是阻碍日本进一步民主化的议会。”"

    "content": "【Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 22nd】 As the wheat harvest approaches, the stubborn and puppet troops have begun to mobilize forces and deploy to plunder the liberated areas' wheat harvest. Taiyuan has now established a \"Grain Procurement Committee,\" with branch offices in central counties and sub-branch offices in general counties. In the Yan-controlled areas along the Tongpu Railway, youths are forcibly conscripted from each \"lu\" (a former administrative unit) to form grain-grabbing teams, initially three people per \"lu\" in the first phase and four in the second, with an expected training of one thousand people per county. These teams will coordinate with the attacking troops to enter the liberated areas to harvest wheat and orders have already been issued to forcibly requisition sickles and other tools. On the 15th, Yan's troops advanced from Taiyuan and Yuci in three routes toward the wheat-producing areas of the Jinzhong Liberated Area. One route, with over 400 people, surrounded Nanzhuang, the location of our Yuci County government. Another route occupied Beige Village, and the third route surrounded Zhangzhuang, later occupying Yongkang Village. On the 15th, Yan's troops in Shicun, Xiangling, transported two large carts of sickles to Linfen. The Yan's troops in Linfen also organized villagers near their strongholds, with able-bodied individuals formed into transport teams and the elderly and young formed into harvesting teams. The Yan's military county government in the county has issued an order to forcibly requisition three \"shi\" (a unit of dry measure) and eight \"dou\" (a smaller unit of dry measure) of wheat for every two silver dollars. The 66th Division of Yan's troops in Hongdong is implementing the procurement of military grain, totaling 2.2 million \"jin\" (a unit of weight). On the Pinghan front, the Kuomintang troops in northern Henan have transferred Li Ying and other puppet troops, veterans in grain-grabbing for eight years, from Anyang to Fengsu and other places in Andong. Wang Zi's entire force is now concentrated at Zhongdianji, northwest of Anyang, preparing to grab wheat. The masses in the entire area are indignant at this grain-grabbing conspiracy by the stubborn and puppet troops and are actively preparing to launch a struggle to protect grain.\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 25th】 This year, the rainfall in the Hebei Liberated Area has been sufficient, and the wheat crops are thriving, promising a good harvest. The Kuomintang troops are salivating and have recently actively reorganized reactionary armed forces in various places, demanding sickles, preparing to dispatch them at the right time to seize wheat and steal the people's food. It is reported that the Kuomintang 30th Army in Beiping has distributed rifles and bullets to the \"Returning Home Regiments\" in the counties along the Pinghan Railway, and the Baoding Police Department is also forcibly requisitioning sickles from merchants to be used by the \"Returning Home Regiments\" to grab wheat.

    "content": "Democratic and United Harbin\n　　Lin Huo\n　　Since the Democratic Allied Army entered Harbin at 8 p.m. on April 28th, it has only been twelve or thirteen days until today, but sensitive citizens have already felt Harbin changing.\n　　For four months, the Kuomintang's \"reception officials\" were high above, reigning over the 800,000 citizens of Harbin. The officials opened their mouths calling people \"puppet civilians\", closing their mouths calling people \"puppet civilians,\" spitting out contemptuous voices from between their teeth: \"Ban everything!\" (what was announced to be banned was Chinese-style, what was advocated was American-style)! In this way, perms, high heels, fine dining, dancers, nurses, going to dance halls... truly flourished for a time. What was not banned, nor willing to be banned, was the rampant behavior of enemies and puppets, with 3,986 robbery cases. Only three days after the Soviet army withdrew, thirty-nine robbery cases occurred in Daowai alone. In the long one hundred and twenty-odd days, not a single Japanese war criminal or heinous traitor was punished. The Kuomintang \"reception officials\" were busy rolling banknotes, loading gold, and transporting silver...\n　　The citizens' conclusion was: the Kuomintang \"reception officials\" did not even mention giving the people of Northeast China the right to autonomy, or letting the people of Northeast China manage Northeast China; even democratic cooperation with the people of Northeast China was out of the question. Therefore, they gave the \"reception officials\" a nickname: \"Chongqing people.\" Although the officials kept saying \"See you in Jinzhou\" when they left, in contrast, the 800,000 citizens of Harbin will never forget the date of April 28th. From that night on, the sound of gunfire was no longer heard, and robbery cases were no longer seen. The people's army marched into the city in a mighty procession from the Jihong Bridge. In the twilight of dusk, bursts of cheers echoed along the streets. On Jiudao Street, a barber said to himself, \"This is truly our common people's army, look how amiable they are!\"\n　　A college student from Sankeshu enthusiastically discussed with his neighbors the stories of the Democratic Allied Army soldiers carrying water, sweeping courtyards, and teaching common sense to the people. A soda vendor said, \"The real deal has arrived, the fake deal (referring to puppet brands) has disappeared!\"\n　　The people's army—the Democratic Allied Army—clearly stated in the first article that it was willing to \"cooperate with all people who advocate peace and democracy to realize the peaceful and democratic demands of the people of Harbin and oppose civil war.\" Under the premise of serving the people of Northeast China, the tasks of the Democratic Allied Army were: \"Thoroughly eliminate bandits, secret agents, and the remnants of Japanese fascism, assist the peaceful and democratic movement in Harbin, guarantee the democratic rights of the people, thoroughly promote democratic politics, assist the development of industry and commerce, improve people's lives, raise the status of women, establish education, relieve disaster victims, and build sanitary affairs\"... On May 4th, 150,000 people in Harbin warmly held a welcome rally for the Democratic Allied Army, where representatives from all walks of life and all strata of society, such as gentry, farmers, workers, women, and youth, unanimously issued a call for unity between the army and the people, to defend peace and democracy, and build a new Harbin. Mr. He Zhian, a prominent figure in Harbin's financial circles, and Mr. Zhang Tingge, a representative of businessmen, praised the Democratic Allied Army for cooperating with all people who advocate peace and democracy to realize the peaceful and democratic demands of the people of Harbin and oppose civil war. Mr. He's comment said: \"Strict discipline, great principles.\" Mr. Zhang said: \"This people's army with great spirit and great strength, undertaking the important task of defending peace and democracy, is not only a celebration for the 800,000 people of Harbin, but also a celebration for the future of China.\" The spirit of democratic cooperation between the Communists and people from all walks of life in Northeast China is also infused into local government. The Songjiang Provincial Government, which was formally established in Harbin on May 5th, is a typical example of thoroughly implementing the \"three-thirds system.\" Among the nine members elected at this Songjiang Provincial Government People's Representative Conference, in addition to Feng Yiyun, Zhong Ziyun, and Wang Xueming, who were Communist Party members, Ms. Han Youtong, was a member of the Democratic League, a central executive committee member of the National Salvation Association, and now also serves as the Director of Education. Mr. Li Zhiquan joined the Kuomintang in 1926 and is a progressive figure within the Kuomintang, now also serving as the Deputy Director of Education. Mr. Du Guangyu once served as a professor of economics at Northeastern University and now serves as the Director of Civil Affairs. Others, such as Mr. Yun Sheng, Mr. Zhang Anqi, and Mr. Fu Runcheng, are also people in the province who advocate peace and democracy. The newly received Harbin Municipal Government has now hired Mr. He Zhian, a prominent figure in Harbin's financial circles, as the Director of Finance. Mr. Zhang Baiyan, a prominent figure in the medical community, as the Director of Health. According to Mayor Liu Chengdong, other administrative candidates will also be selected from respected social democratic figures as much as possible.\n　　Under the principle of democratic unity, and under the mobilization to defend peace and democracy, Harbin has now begun to embark on various construction paths. Liu, the shopkeeper of Dongyuanxing Grain Store in Taohua Alley, wrote a celebratory poem: \"The People's Army enters the city, celebrating peace and prosperity together, shops open, factories start, no robbery during the day, no gunfire at night, living and working in peace and contentment, sharing peace.\" This is representative of the general public's opinion. Electricity, telephones, and tap water throughout the city have never stopped. The working enthusiasm of employees in various agencies is exceptionally high. The city's middle schools, which had been suspended for a period of time, officially resumed classes on May 1st. More than eleven cinemas screen films every day, and Zhaolin Cinema is screening the new Soviet film \"Crushing Violent Japan,\" which narrates the history of Japanese invasion of China and the Soviet army's liberation of Northeast China, to entertain the People's Self-Defense Army.\n　　The people's emancipation movement throughout the city has begun to unfold. Staff members of the Political Department of the People's Self-Defense Army, in coordination with local staff members, organize people's movement work teams to publicize and organize the masses. On April 29th, a mass rally of ten thousand people was held at Sankeshu Elementary School. At the meeting, worker representative Hu Tieming, women representative Zhang Xiuying, and others, put forward brilliant opinions on the people's emancipation, and their speeches were extremely moving. In recent days, farmers from various villages in Sankeshu, Wangjiatun, Yuanjiatun, Xiaomiaotun, and Fengjiawazi, have held meetings, measuring land and preparing to distribute \"Yutuo land.\" A turning over meeting of no less than fifteen thousand people was held at Taiping Bridge, opposing the civil war and demanding peace.\n　　The 1933 Harbin Electrical Workers' Great Strike once caused a sensation throughout Northeast China. Now, all employees of the Harbin Tram Factory, inheriting the glorious tradition of the anti-Japanese struggle, convened employees of the Tram Factory on the seventh of this month with union organizers to hold the founding meeting of the Harbin Tram Union. Two hundred workers attended, uniting to seek revenge against the traitors and secret agents who exploited the workers, settle the blood debt, and elected Du Weiqiang, Wang Guangfu, Wang Shiyu, Hu Wenxuan and other five as standing committee members. In addition, the electricity bureau and others are also preparing to organize trade unions. Under the spirit of democratic unity, Harbin is advancing.\n　　(Xinhua News Agency)\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\nPeople:\n林火\tLin Huo\n冯伊云\tFeng Yiyun\n钟子云\tZhong Ziyun\n王学明\tWang Xueming\n韩幽桐\tHan Youtong\n李植权\tLi Zhiquan\n杜光预\tDu Guangyu\n蕴生\tYun Sheng\n张安耆\tZhang Anqi\n傅润成\tFu Runcheng\n刘成栋\tLiu Chengdong\n何治安\tHe Zhian\n张柏岩\tZhang Baiyan\n胡铁明\tHu Tieming\n张秀英\tZhang Xiuying\n杜维强    Du Weiqiang\n王光复\tWang Guangfu\n王时榆\tWang Shiyu\n胡文宣\tHu Wenxuan\n\nPlaces:\n哈尔滨\tHarbin\n锦州\tJinzhou\n重庆\tChongqing\n霁虹桥\tJihong Bridge\n九道街\tJiudao Street\n三棵树\tSankeshu\n道外\tDaowai\n桃花巷\tTaohua Alley\n王家屯\tWangjiatun\n袁家屯\tYuanjiatun\n小庙屯\tXiaomiaotun\n冯家洼子\tFengjiawazi\n太平桥\tTaiping Bridge\n松江省\tSongjiang Province\n东北\tNortheast China\n\nOrganizations:\n民主联军\tDemocratic Allied Army\n国民党\tKuomintang\n共产党\tCommunist Party\n民主同盟\tDemocratic League\n救国会\tNational Salvation Association\n东北大学\tNortheastern University\n新华社\tXinhua News Agency\n\nOther:\n粉碎暴日\tCrushing Violent Japan\n东源兴粮栈\tDongyuanxing Grain Store\n兆麟电影院  Zhaolin Cinema\n渔拓地  Yutuo Land\n三三制\tThree-Thirds System\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 民主团结的哈尔滨\n林火\n1946-05-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　民主团结的哈尔滨\n    林火\n    自上月二十八日晚八时，民主联军进驻哈尔滨起，至今天止，为期不过十二三天，但敏感的市民已感到哈尔滨在变化着。\n    四个月来，国民党的“接收大员”曾高高在上，君临在哈市八十万市民的头上。大员开口“伪民”，闭口“伪民”，从牙齿缝里迸出轻蔑的声音：“取缔一切”（被宣布取缔的是中国式，被提倡的是美国式）！就这样，烫发、高跟鞋、吃大餐、舞女、护士、进跳舞场……真是盛行一时。而没有取缔，也不愿取缔的，是敌伪横行，抢案达三九八六起。苏军撤退只三天，仅仅道外一处，抢案接连发生了三十九起。在长长的一百二十多天里，没有一个日寇战犯或罪大恶极的汉奸被处罪。国民党“接收大员”们忙的是卷钞票，载黄金，运白银……。\n    市民们的结论是：国民党的“接收大员”不要说给东北人民以自治的权利，要东北人民管理东北；就是与东北人民民主合作也谈不到，因此给“接收大员”起了个雅号：“重庆人”。虽然大员们临走时口口声声说“锦州见”，相比之下，哈尔滨的八十万市民，将永远不会忘记四月二十八号这个日子。打那天夜里起，从此再也听不见枪声，看不到抢案。人民的军队浩浩荡荡由霁虹桥走向市里。在黄昏的暮色里，阵阵传出夹道欢呼的声音。在九道街，一个理发匠自言自语地说：“这才是咱们老百姓的军队，看他们多么和气”！\n    一个来自三棵树的大学生，指手划脚的向他的邻居们谈论着民主联军战士们给老百姓担水、扫院、教常识的故事。一个卖汽水的小贩说：“真牌的来了，假牌的（指伪牌）没影啦！”\n    人民的军队——民主联军，开宗明义第一条，即郑重说明：“愿与一切主张和平民主人士合作，实现哈市人民和平民主要求，反对内战”。在为东北人民服务的前提下，民主联军的任务是：“彻底肃清土匪特务及日本法西斯残余势力，协助哈市的和平民主运动，保障人民的民主权利，彻底推行民主政治，协助工商业发展，改善人民生活，提高妇女地位，兴办教育，救济灾难民，建设卫生事宜”……五月四日，哈市十五万人民热烈举行欢迎民主联军大会上，士绅、农人、工人、妇女、青年等各界各阶层的代表，一致发出军民团结一致，保卫和平民主，建设新哈尔滨的呼声。哈市金融界名流何治安先生，商人代表张庭阁先生称赞民主联军与一切主张和平民主人士合作，实现哈市人民和平民主要求，反对内战的宗旨。何先生的评语说：“纪律严明，主张伟大”。张先生说：“以此伟大精神，伟大力量的人民军队，来担负保卫和平民主的重大任务，不仅为哈市八十万人民庆，且为中国之前途庆”。共产党人与东北各阶层人士民主合作的精神，同样贯注到地方政府中去。五月五日，在哈尔滨正式成立的民主自治的松江省政府，就是彻底贯彻三三制的典型。在此次松江省府人民代表会上，当选之九名委员中，除冯伊云、钟子云、王学明等三人为共产党员外，如韩幽桐（女）先生，为民主同盟会员，救国会中央执行委员，现兼任教育厅长。李植权先生，民国十五年加入国民党，为国民党内进步人士，现兼任教育厅副厅长。杜光预先生，曾任东北大学经济学教授，现兼任民政厅长。其他如蕴生、张安耆、傅润成先生等，亦均为该省主张和平民主人士。刚刚接收的哈尔滨市政府，现已聘请哈市金融界名流何治安先生，为财政局长。医学界名流张柏岩先生，为卫生局长。其他各行政人选，据刘成栋市长告诉记者，亦尽量在敦等社会民主人士中。\n    在民主团结原则下，在保卫和平民主的动员下，哈尔滨现已开始走上各种建设的道路。桃花巷东源兴粮栈叫刘掌柜的写了一首庆祝词：“民军入城，共庆升平，商店开业，工厂开工，日无抢案，夜无枪声，安居乐业，共享太平”。这是一般市民意见的代表。全市电灯、电话、自来水等，始终没有停止过。各机关职员工作情绪，异常高涨。曾一度停顿的市内各中学，已于五月一日正式复课。十一家以上电影院，每天放映，兆麟电影院并放映苏联新片《粉碎暴日》，是叙述日寇侵略中国历史，及苏军解放东北的记实，以招待人民自卫军。\n    全市人民翻身运动已开始展开。人民自卫军政治部工作人员，配合地方工作人员组织民运工作队，宣传与组织群众。四月廿九日在三棵树小学，曾举行万人群众大会，会中工人代表胡铁明、妇女代表张秀英等，对于人民翻身，均提出精彩的意见，演说极为动人。日来三棵树各屯农民，王家屯、袁家屯、小庙屯、冯家洼子屯的农民，都纷纷开会，丈量地亩，准备分配“渔拓地”。太平桥召开了不下万五千多人的翻身大会，反对内战，要求和平。\n    一九三三年哈市电业工人大罢工，曾轰动全东北。现在哈市电车厂全体员工，继承了当年抗日斗争的光荣传统，在本月七日联合工会筹备人员，召集电车厂员工，举行哈市电车工会成立大会，出席工友二百名，联合向剥削工人的汉奸特务复仇，清算血债，并选出杜维强、王光复、王时榆、胡文宣等五人为常务委员。此外如电业局等，亦正在筹备组织工会。在民主团结的精神下，哈尔滨在前进着。\n    （新华社）"

We are taking this step not because we lack the strength to defend Changchun, but because we hope to see whether the Kuomintang has the sincerity to stop the civil war and achieve peace in the Northeast by making the concession of voluntarily withdrawing from Changchun, and because we are unwilling to have the 800,000 people of Changchun and the city of Changchun be destroyed by war. The Kuomintang authorities' endless expansion of the civil war in the Northeast, and their unrestricted troop transport to the Northeast with American aid, using American weapons, rocket launchers, and aircraft, not only bombing military areas, but also indiscriminately bombing and strafing peaceful cities and villages, have caused tens of millions of peaceful residents in the Northeast to suffer from the scourge of war, cities and villages to be bombed, people to be displaced, and production to be impossible. The Kuomintang authorities' actions in expanding the civil war in the Northeast not only cause disasters to the people of the Northeast, but are bound to lead to the destruction of peace throughout the country. In order to achieve the early realization of peace in the Northeast and to consolidate peace throughout the country, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the General Headquarters of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army are willing to make the major concession of voluntarily withdrawing from Changchun, but the concession is limited. If the Kuomintang authorities still do not stop the civil war in the Northeast, we will still take resolute self-defense measures, and the continued existence of the civil war in the Northeast is entirely due to the Kuomintang's unwillingness for peace in the Northeast.\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th】This office has received news from the Northeast Democratic Allied Army Headquarters stating: After withdrawing from Sipingjie, our army safely withdrew from Gongzhuling and Changchun on the 22nd.

According to a US Information Service dispatch from San Francisco on the 23rd, the Washington Post stated: \"General Marshall's action is entirely justifiable. No country in the world needs unity and peace more than China. Some reactionaries are delaying the rapid implementation of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's promise to establish a democratic government, and the central government's efforts to purge these reactionaries have been too slow. General Marshall has not abandoned his efforts to promote cooperation between the two sides.

    "content": "The Flames of Liberation Ignite Across Both Sides of the Pinghan Railway\n    Over 200,000 People Involved in Rent Reduction Movement\n    Black Gun Attacks Suppressed in Northern Henan, Pushing Mass Movement to Climax\n    [Our Newspaper, Xingtai] The rent reduction movement in the new areas of counties under the First Special District of Taihang has been universally launched. The flames of liberation have ignited across both sides of the Pinghan Railway. According to statistics from nine counties including Xingtai, Zanhuang, Shahe, Neiqiu, Lincheng, Gaoyi, Yuanshi, Huolu, and Jingxing: among the forty districts and eight hundred and eighty-six administrative villages, one hundred and twenty-four villages have moved from rent reduction and debt clearing to production; the movement is deepening in two hundred and forty-eight villages; three hundred and thirty-four villages have entered the high tide of rent reduction; and only ninety-three villages are still in the mobilization stage. Furthermore, according to statistics from twenty-nine districts in nine counties, 216,499 people have participated in the struggle for liberation, accounting for half of the local population. A total of 34,945 tenancy and other issues have been resolved. Landlords have legally returned a total of 14,696 mu of land, 5,150 shi of grain, 4,827 rooms, and 3,733,363 yuan in local currency to the masses. In order to fully mobilize the masses before the summer harvest, the district has put forward the following key points: (1) The mass movement must be combined with production, grasping the characteristics of the production season, and preventing the mechanical application of methods from the slack farming season to the busy farming season. (2) Better implement the leadership method of boldness and allowing a free hand, overcoming the style of paternalism and substitution, and especially breaking the \"stage theory\" of some cadres, who believe that after the anti-traitor and rent reduction are completed, they can concentrate on production. (3) Strengthen the unity among farmers, organize mutual assistance in production, and be vigilant against the landlord's counterattacks at all times. The movement in the entire district is developing rapidly and smoothly.\n    [Our Newspaper, Jiaozuo] The rent reduction movement in the counties of northern Henan under the Fourth Special District of Taihang is currently reaching its climax. Bo'ai and Wenxian counties have already transitioned from popularization to deepening. According to incomplete statistics, in Wenxian, one hundred and five villages have already reduced rent or are in the process of reducing rent. In Bo'ai, ninety-six villages have. In Hui (county) North, Xiuwu, and Wuzhi, it is being widely carried out. In Hui (county) North, eighty-three villages and in Xiuwu two-thirds of the villages are in the process of rent reduction and investigation, while Qinyang is transitioning to rent reduction. The development of the mass movement in northern Henan has been slightly slower than in other areas of Taihang, mainly because the Kuomintang and the puppet troops they utilized frequently attacked the liberated areas, and national special agents and bandits carried out cruel black gun attacks on the local peasants, causing the masses' liberation movement to suffer more difficulties, but also further honing the experience of combining the masses' liberation with armed struggle. This successful experience proves that black guns can only be suppressed when the masses organize strong militia to defend their own liberation. In the border areas, the anti-traitor and rent reduction movement was only launched when the militia carried out a powerful self-defense against the attacking stubborn puppet troops. The recent rapid development of the movement is mainly due to the implementation of the principle of boldness, allowing a free hand, and supporting the masses from above. On the cadre side, the counties have successively resolved the ideological problem of underestimating tenancy issues and liquidated the style of substitution and paternalism. The counties are now striving to universally implement the rent reduction movement before the wheat harvest.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\nPeople:\n\nPlaces:\n邢台  Xingtai\n赞皇  Zanhuang\n沙河  Shahe\n内邱  Neiqiu\n临城  Lincheng\n高邑  Gaoyi\n元氏  Yuanshi\n获鹿  Huolu\n井陉  Jingxing\n太行一专区  Taihang First Special District\n平汉铁路  Pinghan Railway\n焦作  Jiaozuo\n太行四专区  Taihang Fourth Special District\n豫北  Northern Henan\n博爱  Bo'ai\n温县  Wenxian\n辉县北  Hui (county) North\n修武  Xiuwu\n武陟  Wuzhi\n沁阳  Qinyang\n\nOrganizations:\n国民党  Kuomintang\n共产党 Chinese Communist Party\n\nEvents:\n减租运动  Rent Reduction Movement\n翻身运动  Liberation Movement\n清算代替包办作风  Liquidated the style of substitution and paternalism\n反奸  anti-traitor\n黑枪袭扰  Black gun attacks\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 群众翻身烈火燃遍平汉两侧  廿余万人卷入减租运动  豫北镇压了黑枪袭扰群运达高潮\n\n1946-05-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　群众翻身烈火燃遍平汉两侧\n    廿余万人卷入减租运动 \n    豫北镇压了黑枪袭扰群运达高潮\n    【本报邢台讯】太行一专区所属各县，新区减租运动已获普遍开展，群众翻身的烈火，已燃遍平汉两侧。据邢台、赞皇、沙河、内邱、临城、高邑、元氏、获鹿、井陉等九个县统计：四十个区，八百八十六个行政村中，一百二十四个村已由减租清债转上生产；二百四十八个村运动正转向深入，三百三十四个村已走上减租高潮；仅九十三个村正在发动。另据九个县二十九个区统计，参加翻身斗争者达二十一万六千四百九十九人，占当地人口的一半，共解决租佃等问题三万四千九百四十五件，地主依法退还群众的东西共计土地一万四千六百九十六亩，粮食五千一百五十石，房屋四千八百二十七间，本币三百七十三万三千三百六十三元。为了达到夏收前把群众充分发动起来，现该区特提出以下努力的几点：（一）群运要与生产相结合，掌握生产季节的特点，防止把农闲时期的办法，机械的搬用到农忙季节。（二）更好的实现大胆放手的领导方法，克服包办代替作风，特别要打破某些干部的“阶段论”，认为反奸和减租完了，再好好生产。（三）加强农民间的团结，组织生产互助，随时注意地主的反攻。现全区运动，正迅速顺利地向前发展\n    【本报焦作讯】太行四专区豫北各县的减租运动，目前正走上高潮。博爱、温县两县，且已由普及走向深入。据不完全统计，已经减租与正进行减租的村庄，温县已达一百零五村，博爱已达九十六村，辉（县）北与修武、武陟，则正普遍开展。辉（县）北八十三村，修武三分之二的村庄，正进行减租与查减，沁阳则正转上减租。豫北群运的发展，较太行其他地区稍迟，主要原因由于国民党及其所利用的伪军，经常向解放区进攻，利用国特、土匪，对当地农民残酷的黑枪袭扰，使群众的翻身运动遭受了更多的困难，然而也更锻炼了群众翻身与武装斗争结合的经验。这一胜利的经验证明只有群众为保卫自己翻身组织起坚强的民兵时，黑枪才能被镇压下去。在边沿区，是在民兵对进攻的顽伪军进行有力自卫时，才开展了反奸减租运动。运动最近获得迅速发展，在领导上的主要原因：则是贯彻了大胆放手，与自上而下的撑腰作主方针的结果。在干部方面各县相继解决了轻视租佃问题的思想，与清算了代替包办的作风。现各县正争取减租运动，在麦收前普遍贯彻。"

    "content": "【Our Dispatch】Pengcheng Town, in Ci County, is an important ceramics producing area in North China. Originally, there were over 200 ceramics kilns, and their products were sold in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Hubei, and the Northeast provinces. Thus, it is popularly known as \"Pengcheng for a Thousand Miles.\" However, due to the poor quality of raw materials produced there and the adherence to outdated methods from the Ming Dynasty until now, there has not been much improvement. Moreover, they are all coarse ceramics that cannot compete with porcelain goods from Tangshan, Jingdezhen, and other places. The Border Region Government's Department of Construction has decided to establish a ceramics factory there, with Deputy Director and Director of the Industrial Manufacturing Research Institute Liu Yuchen and Deputy Director Yang Jieren personally overseeing experiments and researching improvement methods: (1) Researching the quality of the clay produced there and the situation of indigenous manufacturing. (2) Blending and improving the unglazed pottery body and glaze. Personnel have already been dispatched to Taihang Zuoquan, Huguan, Licheng, Linxian, and other places to collect feldspar for experimentation. (3) Experimenting with \"firing.\" The existing old kilns there all suffer from uneven temperature during \"firing,\" not only consuming more coal but also resulting in significant losses, urgently requiring improvement to increase output, reduce costs, and improve quality.\n    Note: Mr. Liu Yuchen is 62 years old and a renowned ceramics expert. During the Guangxu era, he studied in Japan and graduated from a higher industrial school (the predecessor of the Imperial University). In the first two years of the Republic of China, he served as the director of the Hebei Provincial Industrial Experiment Institute and the head of the Ceramics Department, as well as a ceramics lecturer in the Chemistry Department of the Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology. Only after the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan did he resign and lead workers and students to our base areas to participate in the war of resistance and serve the people. During his more than 20 years in office, Mr. Liu has made significant achievements in the research and manufacture of chemical ceramics, glass, refractory materials, etc., and is a rare specialized talent.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n彭城磁业  Pengcheng Ceramics Industry\n刘雨辰  Liu Yuchen\n边府  Border Region Government\n磁县  Ci County\n彭城镇  Pengcheng Town\n华北  North China\n冀  Hebei\n豫  Henan\n鲁  Shandong\n晋  Shanxi\n鄂  Hubei\n东北  Northeast\n千里彭城  Pengcheng for a Thousand Miles\n唐山  Tangshan\n景德镇  Jingdezhen\n边府建设厅  Border Region Government's Department of Construction\n工业制造研究所  Industrial Manufacturing Research Institute\n杨介人  Yang Jieren\n太行  Taihang\n左权  Zuoquan\n壶关  Huguan\n黎城  Licheng\n林县  Linxian\n光绪  Guangxu\n日本  Japan\n高等工业学校  Higher Industrial School\n帝大  Imperial University\n民国  Republic of China\n河北省工业试验所  Hebei Provincial Industrial Experiment Institute\n河北省立工学院  Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology\n抗战  War of Resistance Against Japan\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 著名陶磁专家刘雨辰  主持改良彭城磁业  边府决定在该处设立磁厂\n\n1946-05-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　著名陶磁专家刘雨辰\n    主持改良彭城磁业           \n    边府决定在该处设立磁厂\n    【本报讯】磁县彭城镇，为华北重要产磁区，原有磁窑二百余家，其产品行销冀、豫、鲁、晋、鄂及东北各省，故俗有“千里彭城”之称，因该地所产原料不佳，且又墨守成法，从明朝直到如今，无多大改良，且均系粗磁不能与唐山、景德镇等地瓷货竞争，刻边府建设厅决在该处设立磁厂，由副厅长兼工业制造研究所长刘雨辰及副所长杨介人等亲自主持试验，研究改良办法：（一）研究该处所产陶土之品质，及土法制造情形。（二）素地（坯子）釉乐之调合与改良，现已派员赴太行左权、壶关、黎城、林县等地采取长石，以供试验。（三）试验“烧成”，以该处所有旧窑，“烧成”时均以火候不均，不仅耗煤较多，且损失甚大，亟需改进，以增加产量，减低成本，提高质量。\n    按：刘雨辰氏现年六十二岁，为著名之陶磁专家，于光绪年间留学日本，毕业于高等工业学校（帝大前身），于民国元二年间，即任河北省工业试验所所长兼陶磁科长，及河北省立工学院化学系陶磁讲师，直至抗战爆发，始离职率领工人学生来我根据地参加抗战为人民服务，刘氏在职二十余年，对中国化学用磁及玻璃、耐火器材等之研究制造，均有重大成就，实为不可多得之专门人材。"

After the liberation of Handan, the municipal government immediately paid attention to the construction of public health, rectified the city appearance, and gradually cleaned up the dirty streets and scattered garbage and rotten bones everywhere. After the Border Region Health Bureau stationed in Handan in March, it cooperated with the municipal government to carry out a disease prevention campaign, and health construction was further improved. Currently, 223 water tanks and 69 garbage bins have been established on both sides of the streets. All the underground drains on both sides of the road have been repaired, and all the accumulated manure and soil for many years have been transported out. In addition, walls have been built around the wells, the wellheads have been covered, and public water fetching buckets have been set up. During the enemy's occupation, the city moat was filled with coal cinder and manure. Now, there are plans to repair it and introduce water from the Danying River.

    "content": "[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th Dispatch] Moscow Today Broadcasting: Chinese and foreign newspapers have commented extensively on the Kuomintang army's military actions in North and Central China. News of continued tension is coming from China. The civil war that started in Manchuria has begun to engulf North and Central China. In Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Hubei, and Henan, the Kuomintang army is constantly attacking the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Chinese Communist Party. Columbia Broadcasting Company's Shanghai correspondent, Ulisa, published a commentary in New York on May 8th, describing the increasing expansion of the Chinese civil war, with the Kuomintang army concentrating its forces to attack the Communist army with the aid of U.S. military transportation.\n    Chinese public opinion strongly opposes the reactionaries' expansion of the civil war and the Kuomintang's reorganization of Japanese and puppet troops to attack the basic forces of the Chinese people, using enemy and puppet troops to massacre the Chinese people. The U.S. military headquarters stationed in China openly assists the Kuomintang army. These facts further deepen the people's resentment and cause great anxiety among social figures. Moreover, American newspapers are commenting on this fact, and Kuomintang officials also admit that the United States is assisting the Kuomintang army. Chinese democrats hope to stop military action immediately, while Chinese reactionaries, on the contrary, want to provoke a civil war in Central and North China, creating new dangers of more dangerous and widespread political disputes. Chinese democratic forces strongly oppose foreign accomplices who provoke civil war and demand that the task of stopping military action be implemented accurately and unconditionally in any region of China.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th Dispatch] Moscow News: Red Star newspaper commented that the continued Chinese civil war and the assistance given to the Kuomintang army by the U.S. military headquarters stationed in China have caused great anxiety and unease among Chinese and American social figures. The newspaper reported that after the Soviet army withdrew from Manchuria, the slogan \"Why not send the American army home?\" appeared on buildings in Shanghai. Many progressive American newspapers have also raised the same question more than once, insisting on stopping interference in China's internal affairs. Not long ago, representatives of the Congress of Industrial Organizations and other mass organizations wrote to the U.S. State Department, demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops. The letter stated: \"The presence of U.S. troops in China violates the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs and encourages the Kuomintang to wage civil war.\" This demand has become more insistent and tenacious recently.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国  China\n华北  North China\n华中  Central China\n满洲  Manchuria\n江苏  Jiangsu\n山东  Shandong\n山西  Shanxi\n河北  Hebei\n湖北  Hubei\n河南  Henan\n国民党  Kuomintang\n八路军  Eighth Route Army\n新四军  New Fourth Army\n乌里萨  Ulisa\n上海  Shanghai\n延安  Yan'an\n纽约  New York\n莫斯科  Moscow\n红星报  Red Star Newspaper\n苏联  Soviet Union\n美国  United States\n美国国务院  U.S. State Department\n驻华美军司令部  U.S. military headquarters stationed in China\n中国共产党  Chinese Communist Party\n美国产业工会联合会 Congress of Industrial Organizations\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中外报纸仗义执言  抨击国民党当局扩大内战责难留华美国军予以帮助\n\n1946-05-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中外报纸仗义执言\n    抨击国民党当局扩大内战\n    责难留华美国军予以帮助\n    【新华社延安二十六日电】莫斯科今日广播：中外报纸纷纷评论国民党军在华北、华中的军事行动。从中国传来局势继续紧张的消息，从满洲所开展的内战，开始卷入华北、华中。在江苏、山东、山西、河北、湖北及河南等地，国民党军不断进攻中共领导的八路军和新四军，哥伦比亚广播公司驻沪记者乌里萨，五月八日在纽约发表评论，叙述中国内战日益扩大，国民党军在美军援助运输下，集中自己的力量进攻中共军。\n    中国社会舆论极力反对反动派扩大内战，国民党改编日伪军进攻中国人民的基本部队，利用敌伪军屠杀中国人民。驻华美军司令部，公开援助国民党军队，这些事实更加深人民的愤恨并使社会人士感到极大的不安。而且美国报纸都评论这一事实，国民党官方亦承认美国是援助国民党军队。中国民主派都盼望即刻停止军事行动，而中国反动派恰相反想挑起华中、华北的内战，造更危险更广泛的政治纠纷的新危险。中国民主力量极力反对挑起内战的外国帮凶，要求在中国任何区域，准确地和无条件地执行停止军事行动的任务。\n    【新华社延安二十六日电】莫斯科讯：红星报评中国内战继续进行，以及驻华美军司令部予国民党军以援助，已在中国与美国社会人士间，引起极大焦虑不安。该报报导：当苏军自满洲撤退之后，在上海楼房上即出现了“为何还不打发美军回家？”的标语，美国许多进步报纸，也不只一次提出同一问题，坚持停止干涉中国内政。不久前美国产业工会联合会及其他群众团体代表，曾致函美国务院，要求撤退美军，该函称：“美军驻在中国，违反了不干涉中国内政的政策，并且鼓励国民党进行内战。”这一要求，在最近以来愈加坚持与顽强了。"

Large numbers of unemployed officers are plunged into starvation and desperately appeal for relief. For several months, the government has established an \"Officer Brigade\" in Chengdu, recruiting jobless students from the Central Military Academy. After the New Army Reserve Officer examination, they are reassigned to various units. Unemployed officers from Sichuan and Kangding have flocked to Chengdu to register upon hearing the news. As of April, six batches have arrived, each numbering hundreds or thousands. The registration conditions are extremely harsh, requiring unemployment for more than two years, along with various certificates such as academic qualifications and official leave of absence. Later, under the pretext of so-called \"imposters and unqualified individuals,\" all unemployed officers not from the Central Military Academy were rejected outright. Even those who had registered were eliminated. Among one batch of over 1,800 people, 1,100 were disapproved. Large numbers of unemployed officers not from the military academy are stranded on the streets. Driven by desperation, they organized a \"Jobless Officer Petition Group\" and petitioned the headquarters, putting forward four demands: (1) Please resolve the issue of food and lodging within two days. (2) Expedite the examination of service certificates and accommodate and employ them as much as possible. (3) Hold a qualification examination. (4) If the government cannot resolve the issue, please execute all unemployed officers to spare them from starvation. However, the authorities continue to ignore them. An officer from the group, surnamed Xiao, has already starved to death. A group of unemployed officers not from the military academy wrote a news release and sent it to newspapers in Chengdu, stating: \"We managed to scrape together travel expenses to Chengdu from extreme difficulties. First, we went to the Officer Brigade and submitted our certificates, passing strict review before being allowed to register. Unexpectedly, the government suddenly issued an order to stop accepting non-military academy graduates. We and our military academy classmates are both citizens of the Republic of China, both unemployed soldiers, why should we be mistreated?\" Finally, they called on all non-military academy classmates and comrades-in-arms across the country who are being mistreated to unite like iron to fight for survival.\n    [Xinhua News Agency Yan'an, 24th dispatch] Chongqing Dispatch: Teachers from other provinces in middle schools in more than ten counties, including Yongchuan and Neijiang in Sichuan, have recently elected representatives to come to Chongqing, petitioning the Chongqing Executive Headquarters and the Chongqing Office of the Ministry of Education, requesting assistance in returning to their hometowns and demobilizing according to the repatriation method for faculty and staff of national middle schools.

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Taiyue Xinhua Daily Editorial\n    Immediately Mobilize to Defend the Wheat Harvest in the Border Areas\n    [Xinhua Taiyue Branch Agency Yangcheng 24th Dispatch] Taiyue Xinhua Daily published an editorial titled \"Immediately Mobilize to Defend the Wheat Harvest in the Border Areas.\" It began by stating: \"The wheat ripening season is coming in the blink of an eye, and Yan Xishan's various organizations are again busily plotting to seize the people's wheat. On the one hand, they are conducting a rumor offensive, falsely claiming that our army is preparing to seize wheat, and on the other hand, they are intensifying their arrangements in terms of institutions, manpower, and furniture. The Yan army has made meticulous plans for this year's grain seizure, and the scale and methods of its robbery will inevitably be larger and more vicious than in the past. Therefore, this year's struggle against grain seizure will definitely be exceptionally complex, serious, and arduous. If there is a thought that the War of Resistance has been won, or that many successful defenses of the wheat harvest have been carried out during the War of Resistance, or that mass movements have seen broad development this year, and thus this serious struggle is underestimated, it will inevitably lead to serious consequences. Therefore, all cadres and masses in all systems in the border areas must ideologically recognize the seriousness of this issue and the sharp and cruel nature of the anti-grain seizure struggle, and must not allow the slightest degree of paralysis and relaxation. They should strengthen their fighting spirit, raise their vigilance, closely monitor every conspiracy of the Yan army, and actively seek countermeasures to victoriously complete the task of anti-nibbling and anti-grain seizure.\"\n    The editorial continued: \"The most basic thing is to launch a mass anti-grain seizure struggle, calling on the masses to mobilize to defend the fruits of their own struggle, to defend the fruits of their own labor, and to defend the crystallization of their own blood and sweat. Implement resolute self-defense against all offensives of the reactionaries' nibbling and grain seizure, and completely and thoroughly eliminate them, not allowing them to seize a single grain. In short, the fruits that the masses have obtained through blood and sweat must never be taken away by the reactionaries and used as their evil capital to slaughter and oppress the masses. Secondly, to complete this complex task, we must rely on strong organizational strength. The leadership should be good at adapting to the specific circumstances and characteristics of the local area, both past and present, and accept the experiences of anti-grain seizure over the past few years, especially the experiences of organizing the masses through labor-military integration, joint villages, joint defense, mutual aid, and labor exchange teams, to achieve the goals of rapid harvesting, rapid fighting, rapid hiding, and defending grain. It is even more important to give full play to the past habit of mountain people going to the plains to harvest wheat and the spirit of mutual assistance, and to call on the militiamen in the hinterland to organize large and small armed labor exchange teams to go to the border areas to help with the rush harvest. The nature of this should mainly be wage labor, and once a battle occurs, they should cooperate with the local armed forces and participate in self-defense operations. Therefore, first of all, we should establish close contact with the local command and militia to better exert our strength and achieve victory in the anti-grain seizure struggle. Thirdly, in the extremely tense anti-grain seizure struggle, in order to organize the masses well and exert their full power, it is also necessary to unify and strengthen the leadership of the command at all levels in the border areas. First of all, we must ideologically overcome certain tendencies towards independent action and form a strong and powerful core in the leadership organization to unify steps and unify actions.\"\n    Finally, it proposed: \"How to resolve the contradiction between defending the wheat harvest and mobilizing the masses in the border areas? We believe that it should not be rigidly opposed, because if the masses suffer losses in production, it will also reduce the masses' morale and affect the development of mass movements. Similarly, if the masses cannot be mobilized, the defense of the wheat harvest will lose its guarantee. Therefore, at a certain period of time, we should separate the priorities and focus on grasping the key points. In areas where the struggle is most tense and fierce during the wheat harvest, we should be good at adapting to the emotions and demands of the masses and focus on defending the wheat harvest. Defending the wheat harvest is also defending the fruits of the masses' struggle. Time is quite pressing, and we should quickly and fully prepare our forces to thoroughly smash the reactionaries' conspiracy of nibbling and grain seizure.\"\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n太岳新华日报    Taiyue Xinhua Ribao\n阎锡山  Yan Xishan\n新华太岳分社    Xinhua Taiyue Fenshe\n阳城  Yangcheng\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳新华日报著论  立即动员起来保卫边沿区的麦收\n\n1946-05-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太岳新华日报著论\n    立即动员起来保卫边沿区的麦收\n    【新华太岳分社阳城廿四日电】太岳新华日报以《立即动员起来保卫边沿区的麦收》为题发表社论，首称：麦熟期转瞬就要到来，阎锡山的各级机构，又在紧张布置抢夺人民麦子的阴谋，他们一面进行谣言攻势，诬称我军准备抢麦，一面从机构人力、家具各方面加紧布置。阎军对今年的抢夺民麦，已作周密的计划，其抢劫的规模与方式，必较过去更为庞大，更为毒辣。因之今年的抢粮与反抢粮斗争，一定是异常复杂严重与艰苦的，如果存在着抗战胜利了，或抗战中进行过许多次的胜利的保卫麦收，或者以为今年群运有广大发展等，而就轻视这一严重斗争的思想，必将招致严重的后果。所以一切边缘地区各系统的干部及群众，必须从思想上认识这一问题的严重性和反抢粮斗争的尖锐残酷，绝不容有丝毫的麻痹和松懈，应加强斗志，提高警惕，严密注视阎军每一个阴谋活动，而积极谋取对策，要胜利的完成反蚕食、反抢粮的任务。\n    该社论继指出：最基本的就是展开群众性的反抢粮斗争，号召群众为保卫自己斗争的果实，为保卫自己劳动的果实，保卫自己血汗的结晶而动员起来。对反动派的蚕食和抢粮的一切进攻，实行坚决的自卫并彻底的干脆的消灭它，不让它抢去一颗粮食。总之，群众流血流汗得来的果实，绝不能让反动派夺去，再作为它屠杀压迫群众的罪恶资本。其次要完成这一复杂的任务，必须依靠坚强的组织力量，领导上应善于根据当地过去和现在的具体情形与特点，接受几年来反抢粮的经验，尤其是劳武结合、联村、联防、变工、扎工等组织起来的经验，将广大群众组织起来，以达到快收、快打、快藏，保卫粮食的目的。更能发挥过去山地群众，到平原割麦的习惯和互助精神，号召腹地民兵群众，组织大小武装扎工队到边缘区去帮助抢收，其性质则主要是卖工，而一旦发生战斗，即应配合当地武装，参加自卫作战。因此首先应与当地指挥部和民兵取得密切联系，以更好发挥我们的力量，取得反抢粮斗争的胜利。第三、在极紧张的反抢粮斗争中，要把群众组织得好，发挥出高度的威力，还必须统一与加强边缘区各级指挥部的领导，首先从思想上克服某些各自为政的偏向，在领导组织上形成强有力的核心，以统一步调，统一行动。\n    最后提出：在边缘区如何解决保卫麦收和发动群众工作的矛盾，我们认为不应把它死板地对立起来，因为如果群众生产上受到损失，也会降低群众情绪，影响群运的发展。同样群众发动不起来，保卫麦收也就失掉了保证。因之，在一定的时间内，分开先后缓急来抓住重点进行。在麦收时间斗争最紧张剧烈的地区，就应善于适应群众的情绪和要求，以保卫麦收为中心。保卫麦收也就是保卫了群众的斗争果实。时间已相当紧迫，应迅速充分准备好我们的力量，彻底粉碎反动派蚕食抢麦的阴谋。"

    "content": "Taihang Wheat Suffers from Yellow Dwarf Disease\n    Agricultural Bureau Rejects \"Yellow Harvest\" Saying, Calls for Seed Selection and Soaking to Prevent Next Year\n    [Our Changzhi Dispatch] Yellow dwarf disease has become widespread in Taihang, especially affecting One-Six-Nine wheat. According to a report from the First Special District Agricultural and Forestry Bureau: this disease is also developing in wheat-producing areas such as southern Hebei and Hebei-Shandong-Henan. From Xingtai and Wu'an to the Shangdang area within the Taihang region, vast wheat fields are covered with a layer of diseased orange. As early as 1915, in the suburbs of Peiping, wheat yields were reduced by 70-80% due to this disease. Now, county governments and the masses are very anxious about this and have written to the Taihang Xinhua Daily one after another, requesting methods of treatment. However, according to the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau's research, yellow dwarf disease is a contagious disease. The reason for its widespread spread is the excessive rainfall this spring. The only way to save the situation after the fact is to implement good methods and prevent it early. If there are not many diseased plants next year, they can be removed immediately to reduce the spread. However, some people in various places still superstitiously believe in the saying \"Black rust is lost, yellow harvest is gained,\" and do not recognize this danger. For this reason, the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has put forward prevention methods for next year, calling on the masses to carry out field selection during the wheat harvest and to implement the salt water soaking method when sowing this autumn. The method is to soak the wheat seeds in salt water with five catties of water and one catty of salt for one hour, then take them out, wash them with cool water, and dry them in the sun, otherwise, it will continue to harm next year.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n太行   Taihang\n一六九小麦  One-Six-Nine wheat\n一专区农林局 The First Special District Agricultural and Forestry Bureau\n冀南 Southern Hebei\n冀鲁豫 Hebei-Shandong-Henan\n邢台   Xingtai\n武安   Wu'an\n地上党  Shangdang\n民国四年 1915 (Republic of China, Year 4)\n北平  Peiping (Beiping)\n太行新华日报 Taihang Xinhua Daily\n黑疸丢，黄疸收 Black rust is lost, yellow harvest is gained\n长治   Changzhi\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行小麦发生黄疸病  农林局指出“黄疸收”说法不对号召选种浸种预防明年\n\n1946-05-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行小麦发生黄疸病\n    农林局指出“黄疸收”说法不对号召选种浸种预防明年\n    【本报长治讯】太行各地普遍发生小麦黄疸病，尤以一六九小麦更为严重，据一专区农林局报导：此种病害，在冀南及冀鲁豫等产麦地区亦正发展，从邢台、武安直到太行区内地上党一带，广大麦田，都蒙着一层病态的橙色。远在民国四年北平近郊小麦曾因此种病害，竟至减少收成七至八成。现各县政府与群众对此均十分焦虑，纷纷致函太行新华日报，要求提供救治办法。但据农林局研究，黄疸病系一种传染病，普遍蔓延的原因是今春雨水过多，事后挽救实施良法，只有及早预防，明年病株不多时立即拢掉，亦可减少蔓延。但各地群众部分仍有迷信“黑疸丢，黄疸收”的说法，不认识这种危险。为此农林局特提出明年预防方法，号召群众在麦收时进行田间选种，与今秋下种时实行盐水浸种法，其法以五斤水一斤盐的盐水，浸泡麦种一小时，捞出再以清凉水洗净晒干，否则将继续贻害明年。"

Recent months have seen sufficient rainfall, and the cotton seedlings are growing vigorously. However, farmers in mountainous areas generally lack cotton planting experience, and the seeds have been sown at uneven depths, resulting in uneven emergence of cotton seedlings. Furthermore, due to soil hardening after the rain, germinated seeds cannot emerge from the soil, causing many to rot. The government has specially called for replanting to ensure a good harvest. In Licheng, after the rain, the masses were organized to break up the soil crust, saving many cotton seedlings. Last year, when compensating for the lack of cotton seedlings, the masses created a transplanting method. This year, Ping Shun is using it with good results, and the government has specially called on various regions to imitate it. The struggle to capture pests and protect cotton seedlings has also begun in Lucheng and Ping Shun. In Ping Shun, 80% of the cotton seedlings in fifteen villages have been bitten through by \"black grannies\" (黑婆婆), posing a great threat to the cotton fields. Currently, each village is organizing beatings. About 160 villages' women, children, and primary school students go out to beat the \"black grannies\" every evening to protect the cotton seedlings. This has now formed a movement, and many villages have even set up \"black granny\" command posts.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n太行   Taihang\n平潞   Ping Lu\n长治   Changzhi\n黎城   Licheng\n平顺   Ping Shun\n黑婆婆 black grannies\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行棉苗动锄  平、潞妇孩捉虫保苗形成运动\n\n1946-05-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行棉苗动锄\n    平、潞妇孩捉虫保苗形成运动\n    【本报长治讯】目前各地区棉苗已开始动锄，月来雨水充足，棉苗甚旺，但山地农民普遍缺乏种棉经验，下种深浅不均，棉苗出土不齐，且因雨后地皮胶结，发芽种籽不能出土，烂坏不少。政府特号召补种，以保证收成。黎城雨后组织群众钊开地皮，挽救棉苗不少。该县去年在弥补棉苗缺少时，群众创造的移植法，今年平顺运用，结果良好，政府特号召各地仿行。捕捉害虫保卫棉苗的斗争，亦在潞城、平顺等地开始，平顺十五个村，百分之八十棉苗均被黑婆婆咬破，对棉田威胁甚大，现各村正组织扑打，约有百六十多个村庄的妇女儿童及小学学生，每天傍晚都去打黑婆，保卫棉苗，现已形成运动，不少村并设有打黑婆指挥部。"

The massive mass dredging and embankment project on the Daming and Xingtai areas had not yet been completed when the rivers swelled and flooded, causing disasters. In the Daming and Wei County areas of the Jinan Third Sub-district, more than 160 villages were flooded, with the 16 villages within the Wei County remote embankment being the most severely affected. According to statistics from 49 villages in Wei County alone, over 1,800 houses collapsed, and over 1,300 hectares of land were flooded. All autumn seedlings were drowned, and the wheat harvest was reduced by half, with the best yield being only 50%. In the first, second, and third districts east of the Pinghan Railway in Xingtai, the terrain is very low. At the junction of the second and third districts, there are four large depressions (basins). This heavy rain caused eight villages including Wujiaqiao and Hequ to be flooded, inundating over 10,600 hectares of farmland. Autumn seedlings were drowned, and only 60% of the summer wheat could be harvested. The democratic governments of the two districts are actively carrying out relief work. The Jinan Administrative Office has allocated 1 million jin of relief grain and 800,000 yuan in relief funds to the Daming disaster area. County Magistrate Wu of Xingtai County and the county's Construction Section rushed to the disaster area to express sympathy, investigate the situation, carry out emergency relief, and organize sideline production for disaster victims to strive for self-salvation after the disaster occurred. The Taihang Administrative Office has approved the allocation of 10,000 jin of grain for work relief and is actively organizing the local masses to dig channels for drainage, excavating a 7.5 kilometer-long drainage canal from Puzhou Tun to Da Lü Village to allow accumulated water to flow into the Niuwei River. After this canal is completed, the flooded land can be replanted with autumn seedlings, and the four depressions can also be transformed into fertile fields.

    "content": "Following the implementation of the policy of public assistance for privately run schools,\n    Taihang Elementary School Achieves Remarkable Results.\n    Truly achieving the masses running it themselves, with leadership not acting arbitrarily.\n    [This Dispatch from Changzhi] Since the Taihang area proposed the policy of public assistance for privately run schools in 1944, significant achievements have been made. In Zuoquan, privately run elementary schools account for two-thirds, and in Shexian, one-third. After individual senior primary schools in Yushe and Zuoquan were run privately, they were managed very well. Currently, Changzhi and Lucheng have decided to fully implement private operation starting in May. Licheng, in particular, has done a comprehensive job and achieved results. In Ren Village, this county, during the transition to private operation, model volunteer teachers patiently carried out propaganda, and the masses discussed and raised capital themselves through shareholding to solve funding problems. They also allotted labor proportionally, cultivating four mu of grain and one mu each of cotton and hemp (all public land) to provide teachers with food, clothing, and miscellaneous expenses. The masses are very concerned about the elementary school. All fifty-seven school-age children in the village are enrolled. The teachers are also in high spirits, teaching during the day and helping with people's schools at night, while the masses voluntarily cultivate the teachers' family land. Qiupo Village sold temple property to raise funds for running the school and purchased school farmland. The masses in Lang Village put forward the slogan \"Relying on the mountains to run the school,\" with the whole village going up the mountain to chop firewood and sell it for money, earning 11,500 yuan in two instances, successfully solving the school's expenses. Changning Village created \"Labor Exchange Elementary School,\" hiring local villagers as elementary school teachers and having the masses cultivate their land in exchange. In other areas, such as the newly liberated areas of Changzhi, after the masses reduced rent and overturned the old system, they urgently demanded that their children become literate and educated, voluntarily contributing the fruits of their struggle to organize schools. According to reports from various places, there are several experiences in transitioning to private operation: (1) It should not be simply viewed that \"public assistance for privately run schools\" is for saving expenses; it is necessary to enlighten the masses' thinking and should start from the needs and willingness of the masses. Some areas have ordered private operation based solely on fiscal considerations, causing the elementary schools to collapse. (2) To truly run the schools for the masses, extensive deliberation and discussion should be carried out among cadres, the masses, teachers, parents, and enthusiastic educators in society, and they should be organized to practically participate in school leadership. (3) It is not about abandoning leadership; one should always check and resolve specific difficulties. (4) Yushe has a mass organization called the Private Education Committee, which absorbs cadres, teachers, children's representatives, and enthusiastic educators from society. It elects directors through popular election, assigns specific tasks, and regularly publishes accounts. Many counties also frequently hold parent-teacher conferences and exhibitions to solicit opinions from the masses and report on their work to the masses.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n地方    Places\n\n太行   Taihang\n左权   Zuoquan\n涉县   Shexian\n榆社   Yushe\n长治   Changzhi\n潞城   Lucheng\n黎城   Licheng\n仁庄村 Ren Village\n楸坡村   Qiupo Village\n榔庄   Lang Village\n长凝村   Changning Village\n\n口号    Slogans\n靠山办学 Relying on the mountains to run the school\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 执行民办公助方针后  太行小学获显著成绩。  真正做到群众自己办，领导上不自流。\n\n1946-05-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　执行民办公助方针后\n    太行小学获显著成绩。       \n    真正做到群众自己办，领导上不自流。\n    【本报长治讯】太行各地小学，自四四年提出民办公助的方针以来，现已获显著成绩。左权民办小学已达三分之二，涉县也有三分之一，榆社、左权个别高小实行民办后，办得很好，目前长治、潞城已于五月份起，决定完全民办。特别是黎城，做得普遍，而有成绩，该县仁庄村小学，在转民办中，经模范义教耐心宣传，群众自己讨论集股投资，以分红解决经费问题；并按分抽工，种谷四亩，棉、麻各一亩（都是公地），供给教员吃穿及杂支。群众对小学十分关心，全村五十七个学龄儿童，全部入学，教员情绪也很高，白天上课，夜间帮助民校，群众自动代教员耕种家里地。楸坡村变卖庙产，筹集办学基金，购买学田。榔庄群众提出“靠山办学”口号，全村上山砍柴卖钱，两次即获利一万一千五百元，学校开支顺利解决。长凝村创办“变工小学”，聘请本村人当小学教员，群众给他代种地。其他如新区长治等地群众减租翻身后，迫切要求子弟识字读书，自动拿出斗争果实，组织学校。据各地反映，转入民办中有这样几个经验：（一）不能单纯认为“民办公助”是为省经费，必须启发群众思想，应从群众需要与自愿出发。有些地区则因单纯财政观点，命令民办，致使小学转垮。（二）要做到真正是为群众来办学校，应在干部、群众、教员、家长及热心教育的社会人士中进行广泛酝酿讨论，组织他们实际参加学校领导。（三）不是放弃领导，应随时检查解决具体困难。（四）榆社有民办教育委员会的群众组织，吸收干部教员儿童代表及社会热心教育人士参加，经过民选举董事，具体分工，定期公布账目。不少县份并经常举行恳亲会，展览会等，征询群众意见，向群众报告工作。"

    "content": "Relief Group in Yongnian\n    Fang De\n    In the heart of southern Hebei, the Kuomintang reactionaries, after adding the title of \"National Army\" to the puppet troops in the isolated city of Yongnian, plotted to establish an anti-Communist civil war stronghold to support Anyang and Shijiazhuang from the north and south. This has been going on for nine months and ten days since the counter-offensive. Recently, the Kuomintang's news organs have continuously fabricated rumors that the disaster situation in Yongnian city is so serious that it is \"almost at the point of 'exchanging children for food',\" and have been scolding UNRRA and other relief agencies for not providing relief, attempting to cover up their illegal actions of providing grain to the puppet troops in the city in various ways.\n    From May 2nd to May 22nd, such bizarre things appeared on this tarnished land of the motherland: Kuomintang military aircraft sent pancakes and ammunition from the sky to \"relieve\" 2,000 puppet troops and puppet organization personnel, 4,800 puppet family members, and a large number of war criminals. The traitors recently tore down half of the civilian houses in the southwest corner of the city and rushed to build an airport, so that the Kuomintang reactionaries could communicate with them more directly and provide more ammunition and food! The relief group, composed of eight representatives from UNRRA, CNRRA, and the Relief Sub-Committee of the Liberated Area, sent 122,000 jin of millet and 178,000 jin of corn to Yongnian from the ground to relieve the starving people remaining in the city and the refugees in the liberated areas on the outskirts of the city. In order to rescue them, the precious products of the people's blood and sweat in the liberated area were transported into the city. Hundreds of working people in the liberated area drove carts and pushed wheelbarrows from Linmingguan to the Tanxiapo on the bank of the Yongnian city river all day long under the scorching sun or heavy rain. Once, it rained continuously, and the road was so muddy that it took five days to travel forty-five li. They were covered in mud and even spent their travel expenses; however, thinking of rescuing their fathers, elders, brothers, sisters, they worked even harder, completing the transportation of 200,000 jin in one week during the second and third phases, shortening the time by half compared to the first phase.\n    The people in the city have a saying to describe the \"relief\" provided by the Kuomintang reactionaries: \"Now it is not people eating pancakes, but pancakes eating people!\" Only those who live in the city can appreciate the true meaning of this sentence. Once, a package was thrown from an airplane and landed in a courtyard. As soon as it landed, it jumped up, broke through a hole in the wall, and went out! On May 15 alone, nine packages landed in the Catholic Church where the relief group was staying, and the number of holes in the roof increased from thirty to thirty-four. One package broke through Father Hui's roof, smashed the wooden bed, and knocked over the bookcase. Chen Gui, the 27-year-old Bao head of Jiu Bao in South Street, was beaten to death by a pancake, leaving behind a young wife and a child less than five months old who could not live. The small errand boy (sent by the traitor Yang Yicai) of the National United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) representative of the executive group was watching the plane circling in the sky one day on the roof when a package of pancakes hit his head in a flash, crushing the child into a pile of flesh, and the man and the pancake penetrated the roof and fell to the ground. Mr. Gong Wenlan, a 40+ year old gentleman from No. 12, Shuangguanmiao Street, had at least two holes in each of his forty-odd houses. On March 5th, a pancake broke his granddaughter, Gong Deyan's, right leg into three sections just before her wedding. The traitors, fearing exposure of the Kuomintang reactionaries' atrocities, did not allow her to leave the city for treatment until the relief group escorted her to our liberated area outside the city on May 17th.\n    The people suffered such a tragedy, and the representatives of the liberated areas in the relief group could no longer sit idly by. Mr. Zhao Wei proposed to give them preferential relief. It is said that the puppet government is also \"giving preferential relief\" to these victims. The puppet government's method of \"relieving pancake disasters\" is to form a youth league of 180 people aged 15 to 40 in the city, specializing in picking up pancakes and burying people. They pick up pancakes almost twice a day and bury dead people twice a day. As long as you go to Tanxiapo and ask the refugees who have left the city to investigate the number of people who have died or been injured in this tragedy, they will tell you without hesitation: \"More than twenty.\"\n    The traitors attempted to plunder the grain that the group relieved to the people by over-reporting the population. When Yang presented the total population of the city to Mr. Heng Anshi, the UNRRA representative, he said it was fifty to sixty thousand; however, at a well organized meeting of gentry and businessmen on May 2nd, even the puppet town head only reported a rough estimate of 11,500 people. After the representatives of the liberated area proposed to examine the census and review the qualifications of the refugees, the traitors fabricated for five days, adding the common people, puppet troops, puppet family members, and even fabricated names to make up 6,370 people. The facts in Xiguan are enough to illustrate this: originally there were eleven able-bodied young adults, two children, and sixteen women, but they wrote seventy-seven people on the register.\n    After the first distribution ended (on the 14th), it was discovered that puppet troops and puppet family members were fraudulently claiming grain. Yuan Jinming, the puppet county party secretary of No. 8 Jia, South Gate, East Guan Road, in addition to reporting the three members of his family in the city, also added his wife living outside the city. Li Shutang, a soldier in the puppet recruit camp in the fourth door on the west side of Miao Xishan Street, reported six people. There were twelve such cases with conclusive evidence and twenty-one people. The representatives of the liberated areas took into consideration the majority of the refugees and did not stop the distribution because of the traitors' conspiracy to seize grain, but only canceled their eligibility to receive grain and gave them a final warning.\n    The people who fled outside the city were worried about their relatives and property remaining in the city. Taking advantage of the opportunity that the relief group was in the city, the puppet troops were unable to openly refuse them the opportunity to return to the city to visit relatives and take out clothes for the summer. The traitors immediately seized this opportunity and, on the pretext that the population in the city had increased, seized grain. In the final list of people to be relieved, they wrote thirty-one people, including sixteen who had already registered at the grain distribution station in the liberated area and continued to receive grain according to their households, eleven fabricated names, and four unknown. Judging from the statistics of the population entering and leaving the city from the 8th to the 20th alone, it is not difficult to understand the freedom there: 1,766 people entered the city from the liberated area to retrieve clothing and furniture, but the traitors only released 1,137 people. Zhang Sigong from West Street had to pay 10,000 yuan to the puppet troops in Jize who lived in Nanguan to get his mule out of the city to work in the fields! It is very difficult for real people to come out of the city. I asked a boatman why he didn't care about food and didn't go to Nanqiao (liberated area) to earn money. He told me desperately: \"The two people who come out to raft have to find someone to guarantee them, and if no one guarantees them, they can't get out no matter what!\" When the distribution was taking place, the representatives of the liberated areas went to see the distribution situation and reported the relief work to the refugees, and the representatives were followed by heavily armed traitor secret service teams. Mr. Guo Landun, the British representative of UNRRA, also said angrily: \"The puppet troops salute the people of UNRRA and CNRRA, but when they see you, they still have police behind them (meaning surveillance), that won't work!\" Please don't forget that this is still the time when the National United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) representative of the executive group is handling the freedom of entry and exit in the city!\n    Now the people in the city are very clear. Whenever the representatives of the liberated area pass by them, they can often see the old ladies putting out their hands and making an eight-character gesture, saying: \"If it weren't for this one coming, we wouldn't get any grain!\"\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    Zhongguo (China)\n国民党   Guomindang (Kuomintang)\n冀南   Jinan (Southern Hebei)\n永年   Yongnian\n安阳   Anyang\n石家庄  Shijiazhuang\n联合国善后救济总署   Lianheguo Shanhòu Jiùjì Zǒngshǔ (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration - UNRRA)\n行政院善后救济总署   Xíngzhèngyuàn Shanhòu Jiùjì Zǒngshǔ (Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration - CNRRA)\n解放区  Jiefangqu (Liberated Area)\n林洺关  Linmingguan\n覃下坡  Tanxiapo\n惠神父  Father Hui\n南大街  South Street\n九保  Jiu Bao\n陈贵    Chen Gui\n杨异才    Yang Yicai\n双关庙街  Shuangguanmiao Street\n龚文澜    Gong Wenlan\n龚德颜    Gong Deyan\n赵为一    Zhao Weiyi\n恒安石    Heng Anshi\n西关    Xiguan\n东关路  East Guan Road\n原金铭    Yuan Jinming\n庙西山街  Miao Xishan Street\n李书堂    Li Shutang\n鸡泽   Jize\n南桥    Nanqiao\n郭兰敦    Guo Landun\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 救济小组在永年\n方德\n1946-05-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　救济小组在永年\n    方德\n    在冀南腹地，国民党反动派把永年孤城的伪军加上“国军”头衔，阴谋建立一个南北策应安阳和石家庄的反共内战据点，从反攻到现在已经九个月零十天了。最近国民党的新闻机关不断制造永年城内灾情严重到“几乎‘易子而食’”的谣言，骂联总及其他救济机关为什么不去救济，企图以此掩盖他多方接济城内伪军粮食的不法行为。\n    从五月二日到二十二日，这块被玷污的祖国土地上出现了这么奇离的事情：国民党军用飞机从天上送大饼和弹药来“救济”城内两千个伪军伪组织人员，四千八百个伪属和大批的战犯。汉奸们最近在城西南角把半个城的民房拆光赶修机场，以便于国民党反动派和他们来往得更直接，弹药粮食供给更多些！联总、行总及解放区救济分会代表八人组成的救济小组从地上送十二万二千斤小米，十七万八千斤玉茭到永年救济残留城内的饥民，以及流亡在城郊解放区的难民。为了抢救他们，解放区人民血汗的宝贵产品运进城里去了。解放区成百的劳动人民整天在烈日或霪雨下赶着大车，推着小车从临ｍíｎｇ＠①关运送到永年城河边的覃下坡。有一次接连下大雨，路是这么泥泞，四十五里整整熬煎了五天。溅了满身浆泥还贴了盘费；可是想到抢救父老兄弟姊妹，他们却更卖力气，在第二、三期内一周就运完二十万斤，较第一期缩短一半时间。\n    城里人民有一句描写国民党反动派“救济”他们的话：“如今不是人吃大饼，是大饼吃人！”只有在城里生活的人，才能体会这句话的真实滋味。有一次，一个包从飞机上扔下，落到一个院里，刚着地就跳起来，把墙穿一个窟窿钻出去了！仅五月十五这一天，落在救济小组住的天主教堂里就有九包，房上的窟窿由三十个增加到三十四个。有一个包打穿了惠神父的房顶，砸碎了木床，碰翻了书橱。南大街九保二十七岁的保长陈贵被大饼活活砸死，丢下了年青老婆和一个不到五个月的孩子没法生活。执行小组国美代表的小听差（汉奸杨异才派去的），有一天在房子上了望在天空盘旋的飞机，闪眼间一包大饼砸在头上，把个孩子压成了肉团，连人带饼穿透房顶落在地下。双关庙街门牌十二号龚文澜老先生四十多间房子，每一间至少是两个窟窿。三月五日大饼把他快出嫁的孙女龚德颜右腿砸成三节。汉奸们怕暴露国民党反动派的暴行，不让她出城医治，直到五月十七救济小组才把她护送到了城外我解放区。\n    人民遭到这样的惨祸，救济小组中解放区代表再也不能坐视了，由赵为一先生提出从优救济他们。据说伪政府也在“从优救济”这些遭难的人们。伪政府“救济饼灾”的办法是：把城内十五至四十的一百八十人组成青年团，专事拾饼和埋人，差不多每天拾两次饼，也要埋两次死人。只要你到覃下坡去问出城难民调查遭这种惨祸而死伤的人数，他们便会不假思索地告诉你：“二十多了”。\n    汉奸们企图用多报人口把小组救济人民的粮食掠夺去。杨逆向联总代表恒安石先生报告城内人口总数时说五六万；可是在五月二日一个被组织好了的绅商各界会议上，任凭伪镇长口报也只有一万一千五百人的概数，后经解放区代表提出迄册与审查难民资格后，汉奸们制造了五天，把老百姓、伪军伪属、连上捏造的假名才凑成了六千三百七十人。西关的事实就足够说明了：本来全体青壮年十一人，两个小孩，十六个妇女，但却在册子上写了七十七人。\n    在第一次发放结束（十四日）后，发现了伪军伪属冒名领粮，东关路南门牌八甲九号的伪县委书记原金铭除报了在城内的三口外，还添上寄居城外的老婆。庙西山街路西第四个门里伪新兵营士兵李书堂报了六口。像这样确凿有证的就有十二家二十一口。解放区代表们顾念多数难民，没有因为汉奸的阴谋夺取粮食而停止发放，只是取消他们的领粮资格，给他们以最后警告。\n    逃到城外的老百姓不放心留在城内的亲友和财产，借着这个救济小组在城内，伪军不便公开拒绝他们回城的机会，回到城内探视亲友，搬取过夏的衣服。汉奸们马上抓住这个机会，借口城内人口增加，夺取粮食，他们在最后一次送请救济的名单中，写了卅一人，其中有十六个已在解放区发粮站登记继续领粮按家的，十一个捏造的假名，四个未详。仅就八日到廿日出进城人口统计，也不难明白那里自由：自解放区进城取衣物家具的一千七百六十六人，汉奸们仅放出一千一百卅七人。西街张思恭牵个骡子出城做庄稼，还得给住南关的鸡泽伪军一万元买路钱！真正的老百姓在城里是很难出来的，我问一个船夫为什么顾不上嘴，不到南桥（解放区）哪有个活钱花呢？他绝望的告诉我：“出来撑筏的两个人都要找人连环保才行，没人连环保说得天能也出不来！”当发放时，解放区代表去看一看发放情形和向难民报告救济工作，代表后面还有提枪实弹的汉奸特务队跟着。联总代表英人郭兰敦先生也气愤的说：“伪军见了联总和行总的人敬礼，见了你们还巡捕后面（即盯梢之意），这不行的！”请读者不要忘记，这还是执行小组国美代表在城里办理出入自由的时候！\n    现在城里的人民是很明白的，每当解放区代表从他们面前走过时，常常可以见到老太太们出出手比个八字说：“不是这个来，我们就得不到粮食！”"

All Czechoslovak citizens aged 18 and above participated in this election; in Czechoslovak history, women and active-duty soldiers have also obtained the right to vote for the first time today. Since the Red Army liberated Czechoslovakia, the National Front government, composed of four Czechoslovak parties (the Communist Party, the Catholic People's Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the National Socialist Party) and two Slovak parties (the Communist Party and the Democratic Party), has achieved remarkable results in its governance: First, it has established a foreign policy of being pro-Soviet and maintaining good neighborly friendship and cooperation with all democratic countries. Second, it has implemented important economic policies on domestic issues, first and foremost the nationalization of major industrial sectors, banks, and trust companies, severely undermining the foundation of imperialism and fascism—monopoly capital. Czechoslovakia now has 10,000 nationalized enterprises, employing 60 percent of the country's workers and staff. The machine tool and electrical appliance industries transferred to state control account for 84 percent of the country, employing 400,000 workers. Second, as a result of land reform, 1.1 million hectares of land have been distributed to 750,000 landless or land-poor farmers out of the 1.5 million hectares of land and 1 million hectares of forest land confiscated by the state. Third, it has correctly resolved the national equality relationship between Czechs and Slovaks within Czechoslovakia, consolidating domestic national unity. The National Front government has also achieved practical results in reforming fiscal revenue and expenditure and restoring the national economy. In order to enable the people of the whole country to express their opinions more freely in this election, the National Front also adopted \"blank votes\" to allow all right-wing parties and people who did not participate in the government to write out their dissatisfaction.

    "content": "Urgent Mobilization to Defend the Wheat Harvest and Defend Peace\n    In recent days, we have continuously received news that the Kuomintang reactionaries are stepping up arrangements to seize wheat in various places. Taiyuan has even established a \"Grain Procurement Committee,\" with \"branch committees\" or \"sub-branch committees\" established in the counties under its jurisdiction. At the \"Security Conference\" convened by the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters on the 17th, comprehensive arrangements were also made for the seizure of crops. These arrangements have already been put into action in Anyang, Yuci, Taigu, Xiuwu, and southern Shanxi. It is reported that on the 15th, when Yan's army advanced in three routes from Taiyuan and Yuci towards the wheat-producing areas of central Shanxi, our comrades Yang Zengfu, Deputy Political Commissar of the Yutai County Government, Wang Weize, Director of the Public Security Bureau, Zhan Rong, Director of the District Armed Forces Committee, and Zhang Yingzhong, District Chief, were sacrificed in the attack by the Kuomintang reactionaries' army. The Kuomintang army in Xiuwu also raided our district office, and our district political commissar and district chief were also brutally murdered. From these bloody lessons, we must realize that as our wheat is about to be harvested this year, the reactionaries will definitely come to rob the people's grain, and the reactionaries are doing everything possible to undermine our peace.\n    Since the ceasefire order was issued on January 13, the Kuomintang reactionaries have continued to mobilize large armies and collect grain, constantly preparing to provoke civil war in our liberated areas, thus creating a severe grain shortage in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. This point is even admitted by Xu Kan, the Kuomintang Minister of Food: \"The reason for the grain shortage is mainly the excessive amount of military grain\" (see the Nanjing dispatch of the 15th from the World Daily, published on the front page of this newspaper yesterday). In order to further prepare for a larger-scale civil war, the Kuomintang reactionaries not only unscrupulously extort the grain of the masses in their own controlled areas but also rob our wheat, attempting to starve us and use it as military grain for their civil war. The most reactionary and shameless Yan Xishan even put forward the slogan: \"Rather let a village of old folks starve to death, than let one Jin-Sui soldier starve.\" The reactionaries are attempting to learn from the Japanese invaders' methods to seize the grain of our liberated areas.\n    Peace was earned by the people's eight years of bloodshed and sacrifice, and wheat was grown by the people's year of sweat and toil! We must not allow the Kuomintang reactionaries to rob our wheat to use as rations for their civil war, as capital for undermining peace. We must clearly realize that defending this year's wheat harvest is one of the ways to defend peace and crush the Kuomintang reactionaries' civil war plan. Therefore, we hope that the military and civilians throughout the region, especially those in the border areas, will immediately mobilize urgently, take effective measures quickly, thoroughly shatter the Kuomintang reactionaries' wheat-grabbing plan, and prevent a single grain of wheat from falling into the hands of the reactionaries!\n    The serious struggle to defend grain is before us. In the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we have gained rich experience in defending grain. All localities should make good use of past experience and combine it with the current situation to organize this struggle. The primary point is to strengthen the unified struggle of the Party, government, military, and civilians in the border areas, and to carry out a mass wheat-harvesting defense struggle in the form of labor and arms combination, in an organized and planned manner, leaving no gaps for the reactionaries to grab wheat. Any complacency or negligence will suffer undue losses!\n    The specific form of leading the defense of the wheat harvest is to strengthen the command headquarters at all levels, organize militias, self-defense forces, guerrillas, and armed work teams to protect the masses' harvest, strengthen joint defense and vigilance, block news, and scout the situation of the stubborn and puppet forces. It is particularly important to approach the stubborn and puppet forces for reconnaissance, and report any wheat-grabbing situation of the stubborn and puppet forces at any time. In case of any unrest from the Kuomintang reactionaries, we should rise up to defend ourselves and resolutely strike them.\n    In addition, the stubborn and puppet forces have recently used political deception to organize armed minorities into so-called \"Refugee Return Teams\" as tools and fuses to disrupt our wheat harvest. We should also have sufficient vigilance and preparation for this. For those coerced or deceived among them, we should use various methods to win them back so that they are not used by the reactionaries. However, for those traitors, bullies, and special agents who have fled to the Kuomintang-controlled areas and disguised themselves to sneak into our areas to cooperate with the reactionaries in seizing grain, we should resolutely suppress and strike them.\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n中国    China\n国民党    Guomindang\n太原    Taiyuan\n郑州    Zhengzhou\n绥署    Pacification Headquarters\n安阳    Anyang\n榆次    Yuci\n太谷    Taigu\n修武    Xiuwu\n晋南    Southern Shanxi\n晋中    Central Shanxi\n杨增富  Yang Zengfu\n王维则  Wang Weize\n占荣    Zhan Rong\n张应忠  Zhang Yingzhong\n徐堪    Xu Kan\n南京    Nanjing\n世界日报  World Daily\n阎锡山  Yan Xishan\n晋绥军  Jin-Sui Army\n榆太县  Yutai County\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 紧急动员起来保卫麦收保卫和平\n\n1946-05-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　紧急动员起来保卫麦收保卫和平\n    最近几天，我们连续收到国民党反动派在各地加紧布置抢麦的消息。太原并已设立“筹粮委员会”，在其所辖各县分设“分会”或“支会”，十七日郑州绥署召开的“治安会议”上，对抢收亦作了全面的布置。这种布置，已于安阳、榆次、太谷、修武及晋南等地见诸行动，据十五日，阎军由太原、榆次分三路向晋中产麦区突进时，我榆太县政府，副政委杨增富，公安局长王维则，区武委会主任占荣，区长张应忠等同志在国民党反动派的军队进攻中牺牲了。修武国民党军亦曾奔袭我区署，我区政委，区长亦横遭惨杀。从这些血的教训中，我们必须认识到：我们今年的麦子将要丰收时，反动派一定要来抢劫人民的粮食，反动派正千方百计的破坏我们的和平。\n    自一月十三日，停战命令颁布后，国民党反动派仍调动大军，筹集粮食，时时刻刻准备向我解放区挑动内战，因之造成了国民党统治区严重的粮荒。这一点，连国民党粮食部长徐堪也不得不承认：“粮荒原因，军粮太多为最大者”（见本报第一版昨天刊载十五日世界日报南京专电）国民党反动派为了进一步准备更大规模的内战，不仅不顾一切的将其自己统治区群众的粮食勒索尽，而且亦抢夺我们的麦子，企图困死我们，并以之作为其内战的军粮。最反动最无耻的阎锡山甚至提出：“宁饿死老百姓一村，不能饿互一个晋绥军”的口号，反动派企图想学日寇的一套来夺取我们解放区的粮食。\n    和平是人民八年的流血牺牲换得的，麦子是人民一年的血汗辛劳耕种来的！我们决不能允许国民党反动派抢去我们的麦子，作为他们内战的口粮，作为破坏和平的资本，我们必须清楚的认识到：今年的保卫麦收，就是保卫和平、粉碎国民党反动派内战办法之一。因此，我们希望全区军民特别是边沿区军民，立即紧急动员起来，迅速采取有效的办法，给国民党反动派的抢麦计划以彻底的粉碎，不使一粒麦子落于反动派手里！\n    保卫粮食的严重斗争是摆在我们面前了。在八年抗战中，我们对保卫粮食已取得丰富的经验，各地应很好的运用过去的经验，结合当前的情况，进行组织这一斗争。首要一点，就是强化边沿区党政军民一元化的斗争，以劳武结合的形式，有组织有计划的展开群众性的保卫麦收斗争，不给反动派的抢麦留下空隙，任何的麻痹疏忽，都将遭受不应有的损失！\n    领导保卫麦收的具体形式，就是强化各级指挥部，组织民兵，自卫队，游击队以及武工队，保卫群众收割，加强联防警戒，封锁消息，侦察顽伪情，特别重要的要做到接近顽伪侦察，发现顽伪抢麦情况，随时报告，如遇国民党反动派的蠢动，应随时起而自卫，予以坚决打击。\n    此外，顽伪近以政治欺骗组织武装少数所谓“难民还乡队”等，作为破坏我们麦收的工具和引线。对此，我们亦应有足够的警惕和准备，对其中胁从分子或受欺骗的群众，我们应用各种方法争取他们回头，使他们不为反动派所利用，但对那些逃亡在国民党统治区的汉奸，恶霸与特务，伪装潜入我区，配合反动派的抢粮，我们应坚决予以镇压和打击。"

Bai Chongxi announced at the meeting the instructions of Chiang Kai-shek himself to expand the Chinese civil war. In this instruction, it was said that every combat unit in North China could seize or forcibly purchase grain to ensure sufficient food for itself; combat troops should mobilize among the residents to replenish their forces that had been weakened by the transfer to the Northeast; in North China, a joint guarantee system should be implemented, with ten to fifty households as a joint guarantee, and each household must be responsible for the actions of other families. The implementation of this system is to prevent residents from sympathizing with the Communist Party. Secondly, instructions ordered military headquarters in various places to do their utmost to carry out the civil war, regardless of the truce agreement, and to deploy their troops to where they were needed. The instruction pointed out that in places where military offensives were necessary, attacks should be launched against the Communist Party without asking for instructions from higher authorities. Bai Chongxi said: \"Chairman Chiang ordered you to occupy Changchun.\" The New York Post reporter said: According to the opinions of American military representatives, Chiang Kai-shek's army in Manchuria would fail if it did not receive help from foreign troops. In order to carry out a war of self-defense and stop the attacking Kuomintang army, the Communist Party has now obtained the assistance of the broad masses of the people.

The Kuomintang and puppet troops in Wuzhi and Xiuwu cities have been eating relief flour for half a month. Making a \"relief fortune\" has become another stroke of good luck for the Kuomintang reactionaries in the recovered areas. The local people all call the Executive Yuan Relief Administration the \"Self-Relief General Office.\" UNRRA relief funds are in US dollars. The market rate is 2,500 法币 (Fa Bi) for every US dollar, but through the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, it becomes 2,000 法币. Article 10 of the Henan Relief Administration's distribution method for old clothes even stipulates that \"100 packages of old leather shoes will be sent to the Henan Provincial Government for distribution to provincial-level government employees.\" Only ten packages are distributed to each county out of 1,600 packages of old clothes, and most of those are received by wealthy households. As for the vast number of people in the liberated areas who have suffered disasters while persisting in the War of Resistance, no relief has been given to them to this day. Even the amount transported to the liberated areas is very small. The Henan Branch Relief Work Team, which arrived in Jiaozuo on April 18, did not bring any relief supplies. The doctors of Qinyang Public Hospital treat the people day and night, but they have only received one box of ordinary medicines so far; two boxes of the five boxes of ordinary medicines transported to Jiaozuo have been transported back. Mr. Fu Bi (an American) from UNRRA, when inspecting the distribution of relief supplies on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line a few days ago, felt disgusted by the corrupt behavior of the Kuomintang officials. Now, the people in both the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the liberated areas all hope that UNRRA will send personnel to northern Henan to conduct on-the-spot investigations, so that the relief supplies will not be used by the Kuomintang reactionaries to make relief fortunes for use in the civil war.

    "content": "Solving the Difficulty of Labor Shortage for Farmers\n    Yumin Village Establishes Labor Cooperative\n    Making it Convenient for the Whole Village to Hire Short-Term Workers at Any Time.\n    [Our paper Changzhi News] In the great production movement this year, Xingmin Village in Xiangyuan County created a labor cooperative to solve the problem of labor shortage for newly rising middle peasants and poor farmers who had been emancipated. The village is a model production village in Xiangyuan. In previous years, the whole village felt the lack of labor. Especially after rent and interest reduction, the newly risen middle peasants and poor farmers who had obtained land faced even greater labor difficulties. To this end, the village cooperative specially invested in hiring six long-term workers and absorbed short-term workers from nearby villages to participate in the establishment of a labor cooperative. This allows emancipated households and rising middle peasants lacking labor to invest and hire labor from the cooperative at any time, enabling production to proceed in a timely manner. The wages paid are generally lower than hiring short-term workers.

    "content": "[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] As the summer harvest approaches, the Kuomintang and Yan Xishan's troops along the borders of our region are actively pursuing their conspiracy to seize grain from the liberated areas by force. A consolidated report follows:\n    The Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters of the Kuomintang convened a \"Security Conference\" on the 17th, gathering high-ranking military officers from its subordinate units and those under its control. Liu Ruming, Deputy Director of the Pacification Headquarters and concurrently Commander of the Fourth Pacification Zone, Dong Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang's 38th Army Corps, and Liu Maoen, Chairman of Henan Province, arrived in Zhengzhou before the 17th. Local miscellaneous puppet troops leaders along the Longhai Railway have successively rushed to the meeting. It is known that Liu Zhi personally presided over the meeting. According to insiders, deploying attacks on the liberated areas to seize grain is the main content of this \"Security Conference.\" Sure enough, after the \"Security Conference,\" the puppet Sun Dianying's unit and the Jixian Security Regiment have started seizing wheat in Shangxia Village in the county. The Qixian Security Team has set out to the Third District to seize wheat. The Kuomintang troops in Anyang have already reaped all the wheat within two to three hundred meters around the city.\n    In southern Shanxi: The 59th Division of the Kuomintang troops stationed in Shanzhou and Lingbao transported supplies from Shanzhou to Taiyangdu on the north bank of the Yellow River on the 18th, claiming they would enter southern Shanxi to seize wheat within ten days. The 167th Division stationed in Yuncheng and Anyi has forcibly conscripted a large number of laborers in preparation for action. On the 15th, a Kuomintang plane flew to the sky above Wenxi, circling for more than twenty minutes, dropping twenty-three boxes of bullets, four boxes of hand grenades, and 3.4 million legal tender, along with a secret order instructing the Yan Xishan's troops in the city to \"cooperate with the Kuomintang troops moving north to seize wheat.\"\n    Yan Xishan's troops stationed in various blockhouses along the Tongpu and Zhengtai Railways are increasingly rampant in their grain-grabbing activities. Before mid-month, they successively convened \"village head meetings\" in various villages, announcing the so-called \"Summer Harvest Discipline,\" stipulating that whoever fails to complete the summer harvest grain-seizure task will \"commit suicide\" with a pistol, knife, rope, or poison. Yan Xishan's troops also put forward the slogan: \"Rather starve a village of ordinary people to death than let a single Shanxi-Suiyuan soldier starve.\" On the 13th, Yan Xishan's troops from the Changning stronghold in Yuci suddenly surrounded our Beichao Village, seizing five *shi* of grain, six livestock, and kidnapping five villagers, forcing the village to hand over 50 *shi* of wheat, 320,000 legal tender, and provide 60 laborers. On the 14th and 15th, Yan Xishan's troops continued to Donghao and other villages in Gongcun and Shuangcun, kidnapping people and seizing grain three times, forcing them to pay summer wheat, otherwise they would harvest it on their behalf. Currently, Yan Xishan's troops stationed in the area of ​​Beiheliu Village are vigorously arresting laborers and rushing to build twelve blockhouses to ensure the completion of their armed grain seizure plan, and claiming that Jiang will further invade our liberated area villages such as Beihuangcai. In central Shanxi, Yan Xishan's troops occupying Nanzhuang and Yongkang between Yuci and Taigu are actively repairing the Yuci-Taigu highway to facilitate grain seizure and transportation. Recently, they concentrated six regiments of troops between Yuci and Taigu, and gathered more than 5,000 people in Fenyang and Xiaoyi, preparing to seize wheat. The people in our border areas have been forced to organize themselves to defend their grain, preparing to both harvest quickly and defend themselves.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国    China\n郑州绥署    Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters\n刘汝明    Liu Ruming\n第四绥靖区    Fourth Pacification Zone\n董剑    Dong Jian\n第三十八集团军    38th Army Corps\n河南省    Henan Province\n刘茂恩    Liu Maoen\n刘峙    Liu Zhi\n陇海路    Longhai Railway\n孙殿英    Sun Dianying\n汲县    Jixian\n淇县    Qixian\n安阳    Anyang\n晋南    Southern Shanxi\n陕州    Shanzhou\n灵宝    Lingbao\n第五十九师    59th Division\n太阳渡    Taiyangdu\n运城    Yuncheng\n安邑    Anyi\n第一六七师    167th Division\n闻喜    Wenxi\n阎锡山    Yan Xishan\n同蒲铁路  Tongpu Railway\n正太铁路  Zhengtai Railway\n榆次    Yuci\n长凝    Changning\n北超村    Beichao Village\n巩村    Gongcun\n双村    Shuangcun\n东郝    Donghao\n北合流村    Beiheliu Village\n北黄彩    Beihuangcai\n晋中    Central Shanxi\n太谷    Taigu\n南庄    Nanzhuang\n永康    Yongkang\n汾阳    Fenyang\n孝义    Xiaoyi\n蒋    Jiang (likely referring to Chiang Kai-shek/Jiang Jieshi)\n晋绥军  Shanxi-Suiyuan Army\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 豫北晋南国民党军  开始出动武装抢麦  同蒲正太阎军抢粮日益猖獗\n\n1946-05-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　豫北晋南国民党军\n    开始出动武装抢麦\n    同蒲正太阎军抢粮日益猖獗\n    【本报特讯】夏收将至，本区边沿之国民党军与阎军，正积极进行其武装向解放区抢麦的阴谋，兹综合报导如下：\n    国民党郑州绥署，于十七日召集所属及在其控制下之部队的高级军官，召开“治安会议”，绥署副主任兼第四绥靖区司令长官刘汝明，国民党三十八集团军总司令董剑，河南省主席刘茂恩，分别于十七日前抵郑。陇海路之地方杂伪部队首脑，已先后赶赴会议，该会由刘峙亲自主持，据知内情者称：进攻解放区部署抢麦为此次“治安会议”之主要内容。果然，“治安会议”结束后，伪孙殿英一部与汲县保安团已到该县上下庄开始抢麦。淇县保安队已出发到三区抢麦。安阳国民党军已将城周二三百米内麦子抢割一光。\n    晋南方面：驻陕州与灵宝国民党军五十九师，于十八日由陕州向黄河北岸太阳渡运送给养，扬言于十日内进入晋南抢麦。驻运城、安邑之一六七师已强抓大批民夫准备出动。十五日国民党飞机一架飞至闻喜上空，盘旋二十余分钟，投下子弹二十三箱，手掷弹四箱，法币三百四十万元，并附密令一份，指示该城阎军“配合北上国军出动抢麦”。\n    驻扎榆次同蒲正太沿线各碉堡阎军，抢粮活动，正日益猖獗，于本月中旬以前，相继召开各村“闾长会议”，宣布所谓“夏收纪律”，规定：谁若不能完成夏收抢麦任务，谁就以手枪、小刀、绳子、毒药“自裁”。阎军并提出：“宁愿饿死老百姓一村，不能饿死一个晋绥军”的口号。十三日榆次长凝据点之阎军，突然包围我北超村，抢去粮食五石、牲口六头，并绑架村民五人，强迫该村交麦五十石，法币三十二万元，出民夫六十人。十四、十五两天中，阎军继续至巩村双村东郝等村一带，绑人抢粮达三次之多，并迫其缴纳夏麦，否则即代为收割。现北合流村一带据点的阎军，为保证完成其武装抢麦计划，正大肆抓捕民夫，赶修十二座碉堡，并扬言蒋再侵占我北黄彩等解放区村庄。晋中方面，占我榆次、太谷间南庄，永康之阎军，正积极强修榆次通太谷汽路，以便利其抢粮和运输。最近更在榆次、太谷间集中六个团的兵力，在汾阳、孝义集中五千余人，准备抢麦。我边沿区人民为保卫自己的粮食，已被迫自动组织起来，准备一面抢收，一面自卫。"

    "content": "Byrnes' Broadcast Speech\n    Discusses the Proceedings of the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, Demonstrating Future U.S. Diplomatic Attitude\n    Senator Pepper Criticizes Byrnes for Sabotaging the Foreign Ministers' Conference\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th] According to the U.S. Information Service, Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a broadcast speech to the nation on the 20th night, discussing the proceedings of the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference and the future attitude of the United States. The following is a summary of Byrnes' speech:\n    (1) Regarding the assessment of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, Byrnes believes that \"very little progress has been made toward peace,\" but states that \"during the brief recess, we can re-examine our individual positions, which should help achieve an agreement when the conference resumes.\" \"When the Foreign Ministers' Conference resumes, the U.S. representative will strive to reach an agreement on major issues.\" He believes that \"laying the foundation for peace is a long and arduous task,\" and \"cannot be solved by lightning-fast diplomatic victories.\"\n    (2) Regarding the dispute over the Italian peace treaty, Byrnes repeated his three basic points at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, namely, his opinions on \"reparations, the disposition of colonies, and the border between Italy and Yugoslavia.\" Regarding the issue of reparations, Byrnes said that the United States has \"directly or indirectly advanced\" a sum of money to Italy, and the United States is unwilling to \"advance one million U.S. dollars to enable Italy to produce goods to pay reparations to any of the Allied countries.\" Byrnes stated: \"The scope of the dispute regarding colonies has narrowed, but it remains unresolved.\" However, he pointed out: \"The Soviet government has expressed its willingness to compromise on the issue of requesting trusteeship of Tripolitania,\" and \"agrees with the original proposal put forward by France, namely, trusteeship by Italy.\" Byrnes said that he had then \"expressed his willingness to accept the proposal put forward by France for entrusting Italy with governance,\" which was \"out of necessity.\" When \"the British proposed entrusting the British with the administration of Cyrenaica, and opinions diverged, I reiterated the original U.S. proposal to place the land under the trusteeship of the United Nations.\" As for the city of Trieste, Byrnes demanded concessions from the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia on the issue of the port of Trieste. He said: \"We will continue to appeal to the Soviet and Yugoslav governments not to insist on this national boundary.\" Although the dispute over the disposition of Italian colonies (mainly a dispute between Britain and the United States, in addition to the Soviet concession) is no less than the dispute over the port of Trieste, Byrnes made every effort to emphasize the latter issue, saying: \"If the Trieste issue can be resolved, it will not be difficult to reach an agreement on reparations, colonies, and other issues.\"\n    (3) Regarding the peace treaties with Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, he stated: \"Failure to reach an agreement was mainly due to the conference's inconsistent attitude towards economic terms.\" Byrnes revealed that the Soviet Union refused to include the \"freedom of Danube trade\" proposed by the United States in the Balkan peace treaty terms. Byrnes believes that this indicates \"Soviet refusal to open Central and Eastern Europe to the United States.\"\n    (4) Regarding the German and Austrian issues, Byrnes reiterated the Four-Power Treaty on the disarmament of Germany for twenty-five years, which he announced at the Paris Conference. He said that the Soviet Union refused to sign this treaty at present, and Molotov \"first wanted to clarify whether Germany had implemented disarmament in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement,\" and was \"deeply concerned that this treaty would delay the immediate disarmament of Germany.\" Byrnes admitted that \"there is currently no German government that can accept this peace treaty,\" but he still advocated submitting this treaty to the peace conference for discussion. Regarding the Austrian peace treaty, he advocated making every effort to proceed. Byrnes revealed that his goal in advocating an immediate peace treaty with Austria was to weaken Soviet influence over Austria and the Balkans. He stated: \"If Europe is to return to a state resembling peace, a peace treaty with Austria is indispensable. As long as there is no peace with Austria, and foreign troops are stationed on its territory, military lines of communication will continue to be maintained in Romania, Hungary, and Italy. Conversely, there will be no need for foreign troops to remain, except for Germany and a line of communication traversing Poland.\" Byrnes stated: \"The German and Austrian issues will be raised again at the next Foreign Ministers' Conference.\"\n    (5) Regarding the peace conference, Byrnes, on the one hand, strongly advocated that \"when the current Foreign Ministers' Conference is held on June 15, it should complete the drafting of treaties to the extent possible.\" At the same time, Byrnes still expressed some objections to the Soviet Union's insistence, which was endorsed by the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, that the four powers must reach an agreement on all major issues before the peace conference is held. He said: \"The date of the peace conference should be set for July 1 or July 15.\" The Foreign Ministers' Conference should \"submit a draft of each treaty, and specify in the draft which issues have been agreed upon and which issues have not been agreed upon. This approach will allow all participating countries to freely discuss at the conference.\" He believes that the best approach is to submit all the decided and undecided issues of the four powers to the peace conference. \"At that time, world opinion\" will propose the final solution. Byrnes also stated that unless a peace conference is convened this summer, he will \"request the United Nations General Assembly to make recommendations in accordance with the Charter's peaceful settlement of matters.\"\n    Byrnes proclaimed that \"we must launch an offensive for peace.\" He also said: \"What peace requires is not the sacrifice of principles, but rather sacrifice for principles.\" What is the content of this \"principle\"? Byrnes did not explain in his speech. Byrnes also stated: \"If we cannot cooperate in an indivisible peace, we may again need to cooperate in a war that spans the globe.\" Finally, Byrnes declared in his concluding remarks: \"Our problems are indeed extremely serious, but I am not disappointed because of this. Our work to strive for peace has only just begun. We are determined to fight for political and economic peace in Europe, the Near East, and other regions. We will launch this work in terms of peace and the various councils of the United Nations. Our goal is peace, and peace can never be built on the basis of revenge or flattery.\"\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th] Byrnes' report on the proceedings of the Foreign Ministers' Conference has aroused great indignation among progressive members of Congress. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 21st, Democratic Senator Pepper \"sharply criticized\" Byrnes for pursuing only the private interests of the United States, rather than genuine peace. Pepper stated: Byrnes sabotaged the Foreign Ministers' Conference. If Byrnes were willing to make an effort to understand the Soviet point of view, as he diligently understands Britain's, then his peace offensive would have greater success; as long as they believe that Britain and the United States are trying to maintain peace solely for the benefit of their own countries, there will be no peace.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中国\tChina\n美国\tUnited States\n延安\tYan'an\n华府\tWashington\n贝纳斯\tByrnes\n国务卿  Guowuqing (Secretary of State)\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n巴黎\tParis\n苏联\tSoviet Union\n意大利\tItaly\n南斯拉夫\tYugoslavia\n的黎波里坦尼亚\tTripolitania\n法国\tFrance\n昔兰尼加\tCyrenaica\n联合国\tUnited Nations\n的里雅斯特\tTrieste\n莫洛托夫\tMolotov\n波茨顿协定  Potsdam Agreement\n罗、匈、保\tRomania, Hungary, Bulgaria\n多脑河贸易自由\tFreedom of Danube Trade\n巴尔干\tBalkans\n德国\tGermany\n奥国\tAustria\n泼贝尔\tPepper\n民主党  Democratic Party\n英国\tBritain\n美国新闻处  U.S. Information Service\n近东  Near East\n联合国大会  United Nations General Assembly\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 贝纳斯广播演说  论述巴黎外长会议经过表明今后美国外交态度  参议员泼贝尔抨击贝纳斯破坏外长会议\n\n1946-05-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　贝纳斯广播演说\n    论述巴黎外长会议经过表明今后美国外交态度\n    参议员泼贝尔抨击贝纳斯破坏外长会议\n    【新华社延安二十六日电】据美新闻处华府讯：美国务卿贝纳斯二十日夜向全国发表广播演说，论述巴黎外长会议的经过及美国今后的态度，兹将贝氏演讲摘要如下：\n    （一）对外长会议的估计，贝氏认为“对和平所作之进步甚微”，但称“在短促之休会期中，吾人可以重新检讨吾人之个别立场，此当可助于会议重开时获得协议”。“外长会议重开时，美代表将竭力对各主要问题获致协议”。他认为“建立和平的基础乃一久长而艰苦之工作”，“非闪电式之外交胜利所能解决”。\n    （二）关于对意和约之争执，贝氏重复了其在外长会议中三个基本问题，即“赔偿、殖民地处理及意大利与南斯拉夫之边界”问题的意见。关于赔偿问题，贝氏说美国已“直接或间接垫付”意国一笔款项，美国不愿“垫付一百万美元，使意大利能生产货物，以资偿付盟国中任何一国之赔偿”。贝氏称：“关于殖民地之争执范围已见缩小，但仍未解决”。但指出：“苏联政府对于要求代管的黎波里坦尼亚一事，已表示让步”，“赞成法国所提原来建议，即由意大利托管”。贝氏说他当时曾“表示愿意接受法国所提委托意大利管制之提案”，“实出于不得已”，当“英人提议委托英人管制昔兰尼加各方意见分歧之时，余遂重提美国原建议案，拟将该项土地置于联合国托治之下”。至于的里雅斯特城，贝氏要求苏联和南斯拉夫在的港问题上让步，他说：“吾人将继续吁请苏南两国政府，勿坚持此国境界线。”虽然关于意大利殖民地处理问题的争执（在苏联让步上主要是英美间的争执），不亚于的港问题的争执，但贝氏尽力强调后一问题，他说：“如的里雅斯特问题能告解决，则关于赔偿与殖民地及其他若干问题，当不难取得协议”。\n    （三）关于罗、匈、保和约问题，他称：“未能获得协议，主要乃因会议对经济条款态度不一致。”贝纳斯透露苏联拒绝将美国所提之“多脑河贸易自由”一项附入对巴尔干和约条款中，贝氏认为此乃表示“苏拒绝中欧及东欧之向美国门户开放”。\n    （四）关于德、奥问题，贝纳斯重申其在巴黎会议上宣布之关于解除德国武装二十五年之四强条约，他说苏联拒绝目前签订此条约，莫洛托夫“首先愿明了德国是否已依照波茨顿协定实行解除武装”，并“深恐是项条约将阻延德国武装之立即解除”。贝氏承认“目下尚无德国政府能接受此和平条约”，但他仍主张将此和约提交和会讨论。关于对奥和约问题，他主张尤须极力进行，贝氏透露其力主对奥立即作成和约之目的，乃在减弱苏联对奥及对巴尔干之影响。他称：“欲使欧洲恢复形似和平之情形，非对奥国作成和平条约不可，对奥一日无和平，及其领土上驻有外国军队一日，则军事交通线将继续维持于罗、匈及意国，反之，则外国军队除德国及横贯波兰之一条交通线外，即无留一兵一卒之必要。”贝氏称：“德奥问题将于下次外长会上再度提出”。\n    （五）关于和会问题，贝氏一方面力主“本届外长会议于六月十五日举行时，应在可能范围之内，完成起草条约工作”。同时，贝氏对于苏联所坚持的而为巴黎外长会议所赞同的，在和平会议举行以前，四强对于各项重大问题必须获得协议的主张，仍表示若干异议。他说：“和会举行日期，应确定为七月一日，或七月十五日”。外长会议应“提出每一条约之草案，并于草案之内详载某某问题已获协议，某某问题未获协议。此种办法，可使所有参战国家在会中自由讨论”。他认为最佳者，是将四强一切已决定未决之问题，提交和会。“其时世界舆论”将提出最后解决之途。贝氏并称，除非于今夏召开和会，否则他将“请求联合国大会按宪章之和平解决事项，提出建议。”\n    贝氏声称“必须为和平发动攻势”，他又说：“和平所需者并非主义之牺牲，而实为主义而牺牲。”这一“主义”的内容是什么？贝氏演说中未加说明。贝氏并称：“苟不能在不可分之和平中合作，则或将再度需要在遍及全球之战争中合作。”最后贝氏在其结语中宣称：“吾人之问题固极严重，惟余并不因是其失望，吾人争取和平之工作仅仅宣告展开，吾人决为争取欧洲近东及其他地区之政治及经济和平而奋斗。吾人将就和平及联合国各理事会等方面，展开此项工作。吾人之目标，即系和平，和平绝难建立于报复或谄媚之基础上。”\n    【新华社延安二十六日电】贝纳斯关于外长会议经过的报告，在国会进步议员中引起了极大的愤慨。据美联社华府二十一日电称：民主党参议员泼贝尔，“尖锐抨击”贝纳斯所追求者仅美国之私利，而非真正之和平。泼贝尔称：贝纳斯破坏了外长会议，假如贝纳斯肯努力去了解苏联的观点，象他努力地了解英国一样，那么他的和平攻势就会有更大成功；只要他们以为英美企图保持和平仅仅是为了自己国家的利益，那末是不会有和平的。"

    "content": "Yoshida Reactionary Cabinet Formed\n    Newspaper Predicts New Cabinet's Fate Will Be Short-Lived\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th] Tokyo Dispatch: The Yoshida Shigeru cabinet was officially formed at 7 p.m. on the 22nd. The entire list of cabinet members has been approved by MacArthur. In addition to Yoshida Shigeru, the president of the Liberal Party, serving as Prime Minister, he also holds the posts of Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Demobilization of the Army and Navy, and Director of the Central Liaison Office (an institution specializing in liaison with MacArthur Headquarters). In addition, the Minister of Home Affairs is Oomura Kiyoshi (formerly Vice-Minister of Home Affairs in the Shidehara Cabinet), the Minister of Finance is Ishibashi Tanzan (a member of the Liberal Party, president of Toyo Keizai magazine), the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry is Wada Hiroo (formerly Director of the Agricultural and Forestry Administration Bureau of the Shidehara Cabinet), the Minister of Commerce and Industry is Hoshijima Niro (one of the leaders of the Liberal Party), the Minister of Communications is Hiratsuka Tsunejiro (Liberal Party, close to the Mitsui Zaibatsu), the Minister of Health and Welfare is Hamai Yoshiaki (formerly Vice-Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in the Shidehara Cabinet), the Minister of Justice is Kimura Tokutaro (formerly Chief Prosecutor), the Minister of Education is Tanaka Hidetaro (Director of the School Education Bureau of the Ministry of Education in the Shidehara Cabinet). Shidehara openly serves as Minister of State (without portfolio) in the new cabinet, and the other two Ministers of State are Matsudaira Yoshichi of the Progressive Party and Uehara Etsujiro of the Liberal Party (a veteran of the Seiyukai party, a friend of Inukai Tsuyoshi, and a well-known pro-American figure). Abe Mikishi, from the Mitsubishi financial group, remains as President of the Reconstruction Agency.\n    Looking at the overall picture of the new cabinet lineup, the new cabinet is an anti-democratic cabinet led by the Liberal Party, an extension of the Shidehara Cabinet, dominated by politicians raised by the Mitsubishi financial group, and a financial cabinet allied with Mitsui politicians. Therefore, it is a purely Japanese militaristic cabinet representing the interests of the financial groups.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th] Tokyo Dispatch: Newspapers predict a bleak future for the Yoshida cabinet. Major newspapers believe that its achievements will be extremely limited, and the fate of the cabinet will not be long-lasting. Yomiuri and Hochi criticize the Yoshida cabinet as weak and powerless, and in fact the new cabinet is not a cabinet at all. According to a Shanghai dispatch: Tang Jinna (transliteration), a commentator for Shanghai Radio, commented on the composition of the new Japanese cabinet: \"The Yoshida new cabinet was produced with great difficulty because the old fox Shidehara was unwilling to give up power. Shidehara refused to recommend Katayama to be Prime Minister because if Katayama became Prime Minister, Shidehara would not get such an important position in the Yoshida cabinet. The new cabinet will also pursue the reactionary policies pursued by Shidehara.\" The author also stated: \"Yoshida has helped the Japanese warlord clique invade China, so he is an invader, and the invader is our enemy.\"\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n吉田茂    Yoshida Shigeru\n麦克阿瑟  MacArthur\n自由党    Liberal Party\n外务省    Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n陆军    Army\n海军    Navy\n复员省    Demobilization Ministry\n中央联络局 Central Liaison Office\n大村清    Oomura Kiyoshi\n币原内阁  Shidehara Cabinet\n大藏省    Ministry of Finance (Treasury)\n石桥湛山  Ishibashi Tanzan\n东洋经济杂志社   Toyo Keizai magazine\n农林省    Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry\n和田广雄    Wada Hiroo\n商工省    Ministry of Commerce and Industry\n星岛二郎    Hoshijima Niro\n递信省    Ministry of Communications\n平冢常次郎    Hiratsuka Tsunejiro\n三井财阁    Mitsui Zaibatsu\n厚生相    Minister of Health and Welfare\n含良成    Hamai Yoshiaki\n司法大臣    Minister of Justice\n木村笃大郎    Kimura Tokutaro\n文部省    Ministry of Education\n田中秀太郎    Tanaka Hidetaro\n币原喜重郎  Shidehara Kijūrō\n国务大臣    Minister of State\n松定吉一    Matsudaira Yoshichi\n进步党    Progressive Party\n植原悦二郎    Uehara Etsujiro\n政友会    Seiyukai\n犬养毅    Inukai Tsuyoshi\n复兴院    Reconstruction Agency\n三菱系财阀 Mitsubishi financial group\n阿部美树志    Abe Mikishi\n新华社    Xinhua News Agency\n延安  Yan'an\n东京    Tokyo\n读卖    Yomiuri\n报知    Hochi\n上海    Shanghai\n唐金纳    Tang Jinna\n片山   Katayama\n中国  China\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 吉田反动内阁组成  日报预测新阁命运不长\n\n1946-05-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　吉田反动内阁组成\n    日报预测新阁命运不长\n    【新华社延安二十六日电】东京讯：吉田茂新阁，已于二十二日下午七时，正式成立全部阁员名单已由麦克阿瑟批准，新任自由党总裁吉田茂任首相外，尚兼任外务省大臣，陆军及海军复员省大臣和中央联络局（专司与麦克阿瑟总部联络之机构）局长等职。此外，内务省大臣大村清（原为币原内阁内务省次官）、大藏省（即财政部）大臣石桥湛山（自由党党员，东洋经济杂志社社长）、农林省大臣和田广雄（原为币原内阁之农林行政局长）、商工省大臣星岛二郎（自由党首脑之一）、递信省（即交通部）大臣平冢常次郎（自由党，接近三井财阁）、厚生相（社会福利部）大臣含良成（曾为币原内阁农林省次官）、司法大臣木村笃大郎（曾任检查长）、文部省大臣田中秀太郎（币原内阁文部省学校教育局长）、币原公然出任新阁的国务（不管部）大臣，另外二个国务大臣为进步党的松定吉一和自由党的植原悦二郎（过去政友会的元老，犬养毅的教友，著名的亲美人物）。本届复兴院总裁仍由三菱系财阀阿部美树志留任。\n    综观新阁班子的图景，新阁乃是自由党领衔的反民主内阁，是币原内阁的延长，是以三菱系财阀豢养的政客占优势，与三井系政客合伙的财阀内阁，因而它是清一色的日本军国主义的，代表财阀利益的内阁。\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】东京讯：日报纸预测吉田内阁前途黯淡，各大日报认为其成就将极有限，而内阁之命运亦不至久长。读卖、报知抨击吉田内阁，柔弱无力，事实上新阁并非一内阁。另据上海讯：上海无线电评论员唐金纳（译音）对日本新阁组成评称：“吉田新阁在极大难产中产生，乃是因老狐狸币原不愿放弃政权，币原拒绝推荐片山出任首相，因为如果片山当了首相，币原便得不到在吉田内阁中那样重要位置了。新内阁也将奉行币原所奉行的反动政策”。作者并称：“吉田曾帮助过日本军阀集团侵犯中国，因此他是一个侵犯者，而侵犯者就是我们的敌人”。"

On the 6th of this month, Guo Langtao, a Kuomintang Air Force lieutenant, escorted several military vehicles to Fengtai Station. Heading to areas such as Nanyuan and Huancheng, the station, according to the transport plan, ordered his vehicles to be attached to two trains. Guo refused to re-arrange the vehicles, cursed loudly, and opened fire, immediately wounding Xu Renting, a signalman at the station, in the legs and feet. The station staff all felt indignant and elected representatives to submit demands to the authorities for severe punishment of the perpetrators and medical treatment for the injured. The authorities ignored them. The entire station staff, unable to endure it any longer, went on strike on the 14th, causing temporary stoppages on the Beining and Pinghan lines. Following the Fengtai incident, on the 21st, another incident of Kuomintang soldiers beating railway workers occurred at Beiping East Station. At the beginning of this month, Gao Guanglu, the deputy stationmaster of the West Station, was also brutally beaten by soldiers. Railway employees and citizens throughout the city are all indignant at the lawless behavior of the Kuomintang army.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th Dispatch] Hankou Dispatch: In the dozen or so counties in northern Hubei, such as Zizhong and Guanghua, exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies are as numerous as hairs on an ox. These include landing fees, head taxes, paper and pen levies, bench and table levies, wealthy household levies, vehicle and horse levies, as well as other various labor service burdens. In areas where troops are stationed, such as Yingcheng County, the people must provide 10 million yuan in \"horse fodder fees\" each month. In Zizhong County, the grooms of stationed troops stole and sold horse fodder, and even let the horses into wheat fields to eat the wheat that had already formed kernels. The stationed troops in Zaoshi, Yingcheng, also enjoy the right to purchase goods at \"military prices.\" Pork costs 600 yuan per catty on the market, but they only pay 300 yuan, leading to a butchers' strike. Currently, the people in this area are fleeing to the \"lake region\" (fleeing to the lake area near Jiangling). In Yangjiaji, Jingmen, of the 560 households originally in the township along the public road, as many as 167 households have fled to the lake region, with over 800 people, old and young.

In many places, some peasants have already turned themselves around, obtaining land and grain. According to incomplete statistics from six counties, including Chengde, Longhua, Weichang, Luanping, Pingquan, and Fengning, the people have obtained 89,000 mu of land from major traitors, local bullies, despots, illegal landlords, and usurers. This includes 20,000 mu in Chengde, 20,000 mu in Longhua, 15,000 mu in Weichang, 15,000 mu in Pingquan, 10,000 mu in Luanping, and 5,000 mu in Fengning, as well as more than 70,000 shi of grain, and a large amount of cash, livestock, and houses. Other counties, such as Chifeng, Lingyuan, and Jianchang, are also actively carrying out the rent reduction movement. In this province, only a small portion of peasants have \"land to the tillers,\" while more than 90% of hardworking peasants still have no land to cultivate. Therefore, the rent reduction movement must be vigorously and universally carried out to truly liberate all the peasants of Rehe.\n　　In the previous period of the peasants' automatic liquidation, the province adopted the following methods: First, confiscating the land of major traitors and distributing it to peasants with no land or little land. Second, liquidating the local bullies, despots, illegal landlords, secret agents, and traitors who committed wrongdoing during the puppet Manchukuo regime, returning the land they had seized to the peasants, and compensating the peasants for other losses with land. Third, \"assigning land to tillers,\" which refers to the so-called \"imperial granary estate land\" that the Qing Dynasty had seized from the people and given to meritorious lackeys. Now, these lands are returned to the original tenants without compensation. Fourth, \"returning concealed land to tillers,\" which refers to the \"imperial granary estate land\" that was omitted from registration, and the underreported and undertaxed land of illegal landlords, which is also distributed to the peasants without compensation. Fifth, liquidating all extra-economic exploitation arising from land and tenancy relations, such as high rents and \"bangqing\" labor services. Sixth, the land seized from peasants by usurers through cruel exploitation methods is now redeemed by the peasants through interest reduction. Among these methods, \"assigning land to tillers\" has resolved the largest amount of land. The vast majority of those who have obtained land this time are poor peasants, hired laborers, and some middle peasants, who have united unprecedentedly due to their vested interests and gradually increasing political awareness.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\nPlaces:\n\n热河\tRehe\n承德\tChengde\n隆化\tLonghua\n围场\tWeichang\n滦平\tLuanping\n平泉\tPingquan\n丰宁\tFengning\n赤峰\tChifeng\n凌源\tLingyuan\n建昌\tJianchang\n\nOrganizations:\n\n新华社\tXinhua News Agency\n\nEvents/Movements:\n\n清算运动\tLiquidation Movement\n减租运动\tRent Reduction Movement\n\nTerms/Slogans:\n\n耕者有其田\tLand to the tillers\n皇粮庄头地\tImperial granary estate land\n挂地归农\tAssigning land to tillers\n黑地归农\tReturning concealed land to tillers\n傍青\tBangqing\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 推翻大汉奸恶霸不法地主统治  热河农民获得土地  大部农民尚无土地耕种仍须普遍贯彻减租运动\n\n1946-05-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　推翻大汉奸恶霸不法地主统治\n    热河农民获得土地   \n    大部农民尚无土地耕种仍须普遍贯彻减租运动\n    〔新华社承德廿五日电〕热河农民正由清算运动，普遍卷入减租运动，许多地方的部分农民已开始翻了身，获得了土地与粮食。根据承德、隆化、围场、滦平、平泉、丰宁等六县不完全统计：人民从大汉奸、豪绅、恶霸、不法大地主、高利贷者手中，获得了八万九千亩土地。计承德二万亩、隆化二万亩、围场一万五千亩、平泉一万五千亩、滦平一万亩、丰宁五千亩土地与七万多石粮食，以及大量的现款牲畜和房屋等。其他如赤峰、凌源、建昌等县，也正积极开展减租运动。该省现在已经“耕者有其田”的只有一小部分农民，而百分之九十以上的勤苦农民，还没有土地耕种。因之减租运动还要全力的普遍开展，使热河全体农民真正翻身。\n    该省在前一时期之农民自动清算中，曾采取以下几种办法：第一是没收大汉奸的土地分给无地或少地的农民。第二是清算伪满时为非作恶的豪绅、恶霸、不法地主与特务、汉奸，将他们霸占去的土地归还农民，并以土地赔偿农民其他损失。第三是“挂地归农”，这是满清皇朝抢夺民田赐给功狗的所谓“皇粮庄头地”，现在把这些土地无代价的归还原佃户。第四是“黑地归农”，这是漏挂的“皇粮庄头地”，和不法地主以多报少的漏税地，亦无代价的分给农民。第五是清算由土地与租佃关系而产生的一切超经济剥削，如高额地租与“傍青”的劳役等。第六是高利贷者用残酷剥削方法从农民手中夺去的土地。现在经过减息办法，由农民抽赎回来，其中以挂地归农，解决土地的数量为最多。此次获得土地者，极大多数是贫农、雇农与一部分中农，他们由于切身利益与逐渐增高的政治觉悟，已空前地团结起来。"

    "content": "New-Type Employer-Employee Relationship\nTurned-Over and Rising Rich Peasant Cao Shufang Treats Employees Well\n    Employees Have High Labor Efficiency, One is Worth Two.\n    [From Our Changzhi Correspondent] A new-type of employer-employee relationship is growing in the home of rich peasant Cao Shufang in Caojia Village, She County. Before the war, Cao Shufang was a poor peasant who lacked food and clothing. In the past two or three years, under the rent reduction and interest rate reduction policies of the democratic government, he and many other poor people turned over. In the great production movement, he actively worked and produced, improved his life, bought a mule, rose to become a rich peasant, and was elected village chief of Caojia Village. This year, in order to develop even further, he specifically hired a long-term worker. Because Cao Shufang is a rich peasant who grew up in the new society, he adopted a new attitude towards his long-term worker. He frequently seeks the opinions of his employees, cares about their meals. Whenever there is a fair or opera performance, he gives the employee pocket money and dry food. The employee, Cao Si, is very moved, and his labor efficiency is worth two people. He plans all his work automatically, without the need for the employer to supervise him. Shufang often tells people, \"We are all sufferers. We used to hold other people's bowls. Now that we have turned over, we must not forget our brothers.\" \"May Day\" Labor Day is the workers' festival. Shufang didn't know this, so he didn't give his long-term worker a holiday. Afterwards, he hurriedly asked his wife to cook a good meal for Si, and gave him a day off to rest at home, while he drove the donkey to the fields. Si felt embarrassed to be idle at home, so he quietly carried his hoe to the fields again. The villagers unanimously praised this united employer-employee relationship, saying, \"This is a truly good employer and employee, a good example in the new society!\" Currently, Shufang has decided to implement profit-sharing and reward methods with Si to further increase production.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\nPlaces:\n\n涉县  She County\n曹家村  Caojia Village\n长治  Changzhi\n\nPeople:\n\n曹树芳  Cao Shufang\n曹四  Cao Si\n\nEvents:\n\n大生产运动  Great Production Movement\n五一劳动节  May Day Labor Day\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 新型主雇关系  翻身后上升富农曹树芳对待雇工好  雇工劳动效率高，一个顶两个。\n\n1946-05-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　新型主雇关系翻身后上升富农曹树芳对待雇工好 \n    雇工劳动效率高，一个顶两个。\n    【本报长治讯】一种新型的主雇关系，在涉县曹家村富农曹树芳家生长起来了。曹树芳战前是少吃少穿的贫农，两三年来在民主政府减租减息政策下，和许多贫苦群众一块翻了身；在大生产运动中，又积极劳动生产，改善了生活，买了骡子上升为富农，并被选为曹家村村长。今年他为了更加发展，特雇了长工，由于曹树芳是新社会生长起来的富农，他对长工便采取了新的态度。他经常征询雇工意见，关心雇工饭食，每逢赶会瞧唱，都给雇工盘钱、干粮，雇工曹四的十分感动，劳动效率一个顶两个。一切作活都自动计划，不用主家督促。树芳常告人说：“都一样是受苦人，咱过去也端过人家的碗底，现在翻身了，决不能忘掉自己的兄弟。”“五一”劳动节，是工人的节日，树芳不知道，没有放长工假，以后他赶忙让老婆给四的做好饭吃，并补假一天，让他在家休息，自己赶着毛驴上地。四的也不好意思在家闲着，自己又悄悄扛上锄头上地去了。村人对这样团结的主雇关系，都一致赞扬的说：“这才是对好主雇，新社会中的好榜样！”目前树芳并决定与四的实行分红及奖励办法，以更提高生产。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-05-30",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "【New China News Agency, Yan'an, 27th Dispatch】Paris: The election campaign for representatives to the second Constituent Assembly in France after the war is now widely underway, and the work of various French political parties in nominating their lists of candidates has come to an end. The French Communist Party, the largest party in the first Constituent Assembly, has put forward nearly three thousand candidates. The general election will be held on June 2nd. This election will determine whether France continues to follow the new democratic direction of development since liberation, or returns to its outdated old system that had gone bankrupt during the war. At a recent rally of 50,000 people in Paris jointly convened by the French Communist Party and the Republican Resistance Alliance, French Communist Party leader Thorez pointed out: Just as Hitler used talk of peace to cover up his preparations for war, French reactionaries are also attempting to maintain the privileges of the trusts and deprive the people of their freedom and welfare under the guise of talking about freedom and defending property, and most of those who voted against the new constitution were deceived by this kind of deception by the reactionaries. Thorez called on the French people to defend economic and social rights, to defend universal suffrage and proportional representation, the separation of church and state, the separation of church and schools, and not to delay the Senate demanded by the people. Loyal French patriots are now striving to use a democratic united front to oppose the reactionary united front. As is well known, the Popular Republican Movement's alliance with all reactionary right-wing camps largely determined the rejection of the new democratic constitution, while the Socialist Party leaders' ambivalence, hesitation, and failure to expose the reactionaries' conspiracies and tricks, and to explain the essence of the constitution to readers, but merely an attitude of defending a unicameral parliament, greatly helped the reactionaries. According to \"Carrefour\" newspaper: About one million Socialist Party voters cast negative votes. Now, in his election speeches, Socialist Party Secretary-General Mayer is not calling on the people of the Republic to unite and fight against the rising reactionaries; on the contrary, he is clamoring against the Communist Party. The Socialist Party and the Popular Republican Movement have recently passed the so-called slogan of \"striving for power,\" prioritizing the interests of their parties above all else. The government organs, judicial organs, and courts under their control have adopted a policy of tolerating the reactionaries. The leader of the fascist \"Croix-de-Feu,\" Bagnagal, was recently released and participated in the election, while Daladier, still in the capacity of honorary chairman of the Radical Socialist Party, continues to defend the Munich policy. Therefore, Parisians say they have not seen such pro-fascist frenzy propaganda for a long time. All the policies of the reactionaries are concentrated on one point, which is to use anti-communist slogans and slanders to split the democratic forces. However, the French people have begun to see through this trick, and the Socialist Party's policies are being condemned by the party's lower-level members. Several Socialist Party provincial and local organizations have opposed the candidates in the province selected by the party leadership. This fact proves that in the face of the arrogant attacks of the reactionaries, all democratic forces in France will unite and give the due counterattack.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n法国    France\n法国共产党  French Communist Party\n多列士  Maurice Thorez\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n延安    Yan'an\n立宪会议  Constituent Assembly\n共和抵抗同盟  Republican Resistance Alliance\n希特勒  Hitler\n人民共和党  Popular Republican Movement\n十字街头报  Carrefour\n梅耶    Mayer\n共和国  Republic\n司法机关  Judicial organs\n火十字团  Croix-de-Feu\n巴尼加利  Bagnagal\n达拉第  Daladier\n慕尼黑政策  Munich policy\n急进社会党  Radical Socialist Party\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 法国大选运动广泛展开法共提出三千候选人  巴黎五万人大会上，多列士指斥社会党内反动派分裂民主运动阴谋\n\n1946-05-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　法国大选运动广泛展开法共提出三千候选人\n    巴黎五万人大会上，多列士指斥社会党内反动派分裂民主运动阴谋\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】巴黎讯：战后法国第二个立宪会议代表的选举运动，现正广泛展开，法国各政党推选其候选人名单的工作，已告结束。第一个立宪会议中，第一大党法国共产党，已提出了将近三千名候选人。大选将于六月二日举行，这次大选将决定法国继续遵循自解放后所走的新民主主义发展方向，抑或恢复其在战时已遭破产的陈腐的旧制度。在最近法共与共和抵抗同盟所召开的巴黎五万人的大会上，法共领袖多列士指出：正如希特勒曾以谈论和平来掩盖其进行战争的准备，法国反动派也在谈论自由和保卫财产的掩盖下，企图维持托拉斯的特权，剥夺人民的自由与福利，而大多数投票反对新宪法的人，就受了反动派这种欺骗。多列士号召法人保卫经济与社会权利，保卫普选权及比例代表制、政教分离、教会与学校分离等原则，并且不要拖延人民要求的参院。法国忠诚的爱国者，现在正努力以民主联合阵线来反对反动的联合阵线。如众所周知，人民共和党之与一切反动的右翼阵营联合一起，曾大半决定了新民主宪法之遭受否决，而社会党领导者的三心二意、犹预不前，不去揭破反动派的阴谋诡计，给读者说明宪法的实质，却仅仅只为一院制国会辩护的态度，便大大帮助了反动派。据“十字街头报”所载：约一百万社会党选民投了反对票，在现在社会党总书记梅耶在其竞选演说中，不是号召共和国人民团结起来，与正在抬头的反动派斗争；反之，他却叫嚣反对共产党。社会党与人民共和党最近都通过了所谓“争取当政”的口号，而以一党利益高于一切，由它们所掌握着的政府机关，司法机关及法庭，则对反动派采取纵容政策，法西斯“火十字团”的领袖巴尼加利最近被释放，并参加选举，达拉第则仍以急进社会党的名誉主席资格，继续辩护慕尼黑政策。因此，巴黎人说他们已好久没看到象现在这样的亲法西斯的狂热宣传了。一切反动派的政策，都集中在一点上，就是用反共的口号与污蔑，来分裂民主力量。但是，法国人民已开始看穿这种诡计，社会党的政策正受到该党下层党员的谴责，有好些社会党的省级地方组织，已在反对该党领导机关所获的该省候选人，这个事实证明，面对着反动派嚣张的攻击，法国一切民主力量必将团结一致，并予以应有的反击。"

    "content": "【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th】In six counties in western Zhejiang, including Hang County, Jiaxing, Chongde, Tongxiang, Wuxing, and Deqing, more than 30 townships and tens of thousands of farmers are spontaneously carrying out the liquidation of traitors. Since January of this year, the triggered people's revolts have reached as many as three times. According to a May 1st Shanghai Shih Pao (Shanghai Times) communication: Since the surrender of the Japanese invaders, in eight months, the burden on farmers has been heavy, and the heads of villages and Bao are mostly puppet personnel, conscripting soldiers and extorting money, making people's lives unbearable. In the first four months, farmers successively petitioned in Hangzhou, in dozens of batches, each batch ranging from ten thousand to tens of thousands of people, totaling no less than hundreds of thousands, including men, women, old and young, but \"the government pretended not to see,\" and the petitions were fruitless. In the past four months, farmers have stopped petitioning and spontaneously risen up to punish traitors and corrupt officials. The riots began on January 17 in more than 20 townships in Chongde, Tongxiang, Deqing, and Wuxing counties. \"At the junction of the four counties, there was a sea of ​​fire, and the shouts shook the sky. Many heads of villages and Bao were kidnapped and beaten to death under public anger. Another township head, who had been detained by the district office, was also snatched out and executed by the masses, showing that the people had no confidence in the government's handling.\" This incident did not subside until January 21, but in less than two months, on March 13, farmers in six townships including Jiaxing's Xinsheng also rose up in revolt, lasting a week. Later, the county government sent military police to suppress the unrest, and reluctantly detained two puppet Bao chiefs before it was quelled. The most recent one occurred on April 8, when thousands of farmers in various villages near Linping Town in Hang County responded to the riot one after another. The next day, Ganyuan Township, adjacent to Tingzhi Township, followed suit. By the 11th, it had spread to nearby Xiaolin, Anmin, Xingting, Hemu, Dongxin, Lemei and other townships, with thousands of people participating in the riot. The Kuomintang authorities sent a town head who \"usually had the people's support\" to the villages to \"appease\" the situation. The farmers said, \"We have suffered too much and can no longer bear it.\" The county government also sent a self-defense brigade to suppress the unrest. \"When the troops arrived, the villagers were still rioting, and the villagers and the troops were playing hide-and-seek.\" Among those punished by the farmers this time were Feng, the Bao chief of Tingzhi Township, and six Bao chiefs of Xingting Township. Other township government employees in Anting, Tingzhi, Xiaolin, and Liuyuan townships, from township head to township clerks, were almost all severely beaten. A former county tax collector in Wuhang Township, who had been exploiting the people too much on weekdays, was thrown into the river and drowned in the anger of the masses. Regarding the causes of the popular uprising, the Shih Pao reporter quoted the Zhejiang provincial authorities' views on the previous riot in Chongde and other counties, saying that it was due to \"the people's demand for the settlement of accounts, and the lack of transparency in the past collection of money, rice, firewood, food, and quilts by county, township, and Bao personnel, and the people's demand for the settlement of accounts.\" It also quoted a certain newspaper, believing that the people have suffered too much from the enemy and puppet's heavy taxes and extortion, and now the government still asks the people to collect and dispatch, arousing public outrage, and thus there is \"the villagers' liquidation of township finances and grains, the so-called old debts and new debts are settled together.\" From this, the reporter stated: \"The countryside needs peace and democracy. Only with these can it gradually embark on the road of construction and prosperity.\"\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n地方   Places:\n浙西\tZhexi (Western Zhejiang)\n杭县\tHang County\n嘉兴\tJiaxing\n崇德\tChongde\n桐乡\tTongxiang\n吴兴\tWuxing\n德清\tDeqing\n延安\tYan'an\n杭州\tHangzhou\n亭趾乡  Tingzhi Township\n临平镇  Linping Town\n干元乡 Ganyuan Township\n小林\tXiaolin\n安民\tAnmin\n星亭\tXingting\n和睦\tHemu\n东新\tDongxin\n乐梅\tLemei\n五杭乡 Wuhang Township\n\n人物   People:\n冯某\tFeng (Surname)\n\n组织与机构   Organizations and Institutions:\n新华社\tXinhua News Agency\n上海时事新报 Shanghai Shih Pao (Shanghai Times)\n区署\tDistrict Office\n国民党\tKuomintang\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 浙西勒索苛重民不聊生数万农民自动反奸清算  桐乡德清等县一片烽火喊声震天\n\n1946-05-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　浙西勒索苛重民不聊生数万农民自动反奸清算\n    桐乡德清等县一片烽火喊声震天\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】浙西杭县、嘉兴、崇德、桐乡、吴兴、德清等六县三十余乡镇农民数万人，自动进行反奸清算。自本年一月迄今，被激起的民变已达三次之多。据五月一日上海时事新报通讯：自日寇投降以来，八个月中，农民负担苛重，而乡保长多系伪人员，抽丁勒索，民不聊生。农民最初四个月中，陆续到杭州请愿，先后计数十批，每批从万人至数万人，总计不下数十万人，男女老幼均有，但“政府装做看不见”，请愿毫无结果。今年四个月来，农民不再请愿，便自动起来惩办汉奸及贪官污吏，暴动从一月十七日崇德、桐乡、德清、吴兴四县二十几个乡镇开始，“四县接境处，一片烽火，喊声震天，乡保长多人被绑架而出，在众怒之下殴毙。另一乡长，已由区署拘押，也被民众劫出处死，表现出民众毫不信任政府的处置”。这次事变，直至一月二十一日始息，但不到两月，在三月十三日，嘉兴新胜等六处乡镇农民，亦起而暴动，历时计一周。后来县政府派军警去弹压，并不得已扣办了两个伪保长，始告平息。最近一次，是发生在四月八日，杭县临平镇附近各个乡数千农民，先后响应暴动。次日，与亭趾乡比邻的干元乡继起响应，十一日已波及附近的小林、安民、星亭、和睦、东新、乐梅等各乡，参加暴动的达数千人。国民党当局派了一个“素得民心”的镇长，下乡“抚慰”，农民们说：“我们太吃亏了，已忍受不下去了”。县政府并派了自卫大队来弹压，“部队开到，乡民仍然骚动，乡民和部队象捉迷藏一样的周旋着”。这次被农民们所惩办的，有亭趾乡保长冯某，星亭乡的六个保长，其他如安亭、亭趾、小林、六元各乡乡公所的职员，上至乡长，下至乡丁，几乎都遭到痛殴。五杭乡一个前任县税收员，因平日鱼肉乡民太甚，此次在群众激愤之下，被投入河中溺毙。民变发生的原因，时事新报记者征引浙省当局对上次崇德等县暴动事件的看法说：是由于“民众要求清算帐款，及各县乡保人员过去征收钱米、柴火、食物、棉被等用途不公开，民众要求清算”。又引述某报的话，认为民众受敌伪苛征暴敛已不胜负担之苦，今官厅仍问老百姓收派，激起公愤，遂有“乡民清算乡镇财粮之举，所谓旧欠新债一起清算是也。由此，该记者表示：“农村需要和平，需要民主，唯有了这，才能使它逐渐走上建设与繁荣的大道”。"

    "content": "Shithang District's mass movement has been previously reported by this agency. This communication describes how the people elected their government and intensified production after the mass movement. – Editor\n\n　　The Biggest Happy Event\n\n　　In the rent reduction and anti-traitor movement in Shithang District, when many big landlords calculated the rent refunds, some voluntarily used part of their land to offset the debt because they couldn't refund the grain. As a result, tenants obtained a small amount of land. This was insignificant for the big landlords, but it was the biggest happy event for the tenants.\n\n　　For decades, no, even for hundreds or thousands of years, tenants had never owned land. Their fathers, grandfathers, and even great-grandfathers had always cultivated other people's land. As many tenants said, \"Even the place to urinate was the landlord's and had to be rented.\"\n\n　　But what about now? Many tenants had a foundation to build on, and the \"place to urinate\" was no longer the landlord's.\n\n　　Tenants in Xu Village, Seqiao West, held a victory and emancipation meeting, with firecrackers exploding and dragon boat dances surging back and forth. They enthusiastically celebrated this biggest happy event.\n\n　　\"Congratulations! Congratulations!\" Tenants greeted each other with clasped hands and smiles upon entering the meeting place.\n\n　　Yang Liutang had suffered hardships in the past and saved some money, wanting to buy two mu of foundation land, but poor people couldn't buy land. In the end, the landlord Liu Hongru padded the price and bought it. Liu Hongru said to him, \"You have the life to buy land, but not the fate to buy the sky!\" (meaning that poor people have money to buy land, but the world doesn't belong to the poor, so the land still cannot be bought). This time, when calculating the rent refunds, Liu was willing to offset the debt with land.\n\n　　The landlords made new \"contracts\" for the tenants. The tenants held the new contracts and discussed how to go to the government to \"pay taxes\" after the wheat harvest. They treasured the \"contracts\" as precious heavenly books. Some tenants showed the \"contracts\" to this person and then to that person, saying to everyone, \"Now we can be emancipated!\" Those old grandfathers, who were older, said excitedly, \"In our lifetime, we have land!\"\n\n　　They Were Masters for the First Time\n\n　　Electing the township head was a first in the history of Eqian Township, Shithang District!\n\n　　In the past, the common people had never heard of electing a township head, thinking that \"the township head is an official sent from above.\"\n\n　　But after this rent reduction, the thinking of the common people changed. They thought, \"Now that democracy has arrived, the people must be their own masters. To be thoroughly emancipated, we must have a township head who is a leader of the common people.\"\n\n　　Eighty-odd representatives, carrying the hopes of all the people in the township and with a pair of sharp eyes, were electing the township head in Shu Village.\n\n　　Many of the representatives were women. They were especially happy today because they also participated in the election.\n\n　　The eyes of the representatives were like penetrating mirrors, fixed on the candidates they proposed, wondering which one was good.\n\n　　Seven administrative committee members were elected, very solemnly elected. Among them were two poor peasants, and one each of family members of soldiers, gentry, workers, middle peasants, and rich peasants. Zhao Biwen was elected township head.\n\n　　The newly elected committee members stood in front of the stage awkwardly. The representatives looked at them greedily, like looking at a new bride, at their newly elected leaders. Applause and laughter blended into one.\n\n　　\"You must serve us well in the future,\" the representatives put forward their opinions to the newly elected committee members on the spot. \"You must lead us to seek thorough emancipation. Don't be arbitrary in anything, and discuss it with everyone. This is our hope…\"\n\n　　\"I am a mud leg (Northern Jiangsu dialect, meaning peasant). Since everyone elected me, I will serve everyone well.\" Zhao Biwen, representing all the committee members, accepted the opinions, his face red, like a big girl: \"In the future, I hope everyone will help more. If we have anything wrong, please point it out immediately to help us correct it. If you don't point it out to us, it will harm me and everyone.\"\n\n　　The representatives left the meeting place and talked and laughed on the way back because they were masters for the first time today.\n\n　　Working Hard on Production\n\n　　Twenty-one villagers from Qiu Village, Shithang District, were digging ditches in Erzigo. They were all newly emancipated peasants. They thought, \"This year we must plant autumn crops, and we can't let it be barren like last year.\"\n\n　　Some people stood at the bottom of the ditch, some people stood at the edge of the ditch, and the silt was transmitted from the bottom of the ditch to the shore with shovels, transmitting, transmitting. The trousers of the people at the bottom of the ditch were rolled up to their knees, and their feet were covered with mud, like wearing a pair of tall, black leather boots.\n\n　　They were laughing, they were working, and the joy in their hearts couldn't stop leaking out of their laughter. The gentle spring breeze blew away the sorrows on their faces.\n\n　　This ditch hadn't been dug for two years. If it wasn't dug, could they still plant rice seedlings?\n\n　　Indeed, the silt in Erzigo had accumulated two or three chi deep. This ditch passed through the river, and the fields on both sides of the river relied on its water every year!\n\n　　\"Since the Communist Party came,\" Wei Jingyuan shoveled a shovelful of mud onto the shore, \"the people have had a good life. Leading the people to emancipation, leading the people to production, is all for the people!\"\n\n　　Wei Jingyuan wiped the sweat from his head and looked at Xiliuwei, which was close to the west side of Qiu Village. He said, \"I heard that each family in Liuwei has formulated a production plan, buying pigs, cutting grass, digging ditches, and repairing vehicles, preparing to work hard on production!\"\n\n　　\"We must take the lead and work hard! Our Qiu Village also wants to wear a big red flower for digging ditches!\" Wei Jingyuan was the captain, and he encouraged everyone with a smile. They had proposed at the meeting to compare, and whoever was good and fast would wear a big red flower.\n\n　　\"The Touzigo and Sanzigo are designated for other villages to dig. Why haven't they started work yet?\" \"Let's do well and give them a push. We don't have to worry about them not digging!\"\n\n　　Jin Buyun looked to the south and suddenly said, \"Wei Village has also started work. Touzigo is the responsibility of Wei Village.\" Everyone raised their heads and looked south when they heard him say this. Sure enough, looking over the green rice seedlings, a few heads were exposed on the distant edge of the ditch, and pieces of soil were flying regularly from the bottom of the ditch to the shore.\n\n　　Now who is not happy when production is mentioned? Now everyone is willing to endure hardships, and everyone sees that Wei Village has also started work, and they are all excited.\n\n　　\"Who is not happy? Now even suffering is hopeful.\" Li Fengying stood at the bottom of the ditch and dug a shovel of mud. She was digging the ditch like a man.\n\n　　\"Okay, three years later, see what kind of place we are here.\" Wei Jingyuan said proudly, and a very beautiful vision emerged in everyone's minds, and they all laughed.\n\n　　In the evening, the sun was still ten feet high, and everyone sat on the river bank to rest, smoking dry tobacco.\n\n　　\"We have done thirty zhang today!\"\n\n　　\"How about resting?\"\n\n　　\"Don't you want to do a little more?\"\n\n　　\"Okay, let's do a little more.\"\n\n　　Everyone jumped into the ditch again. Dozens of children and young women were grabbing green grass in the wheat fields, preparing to go back to make fertilizer. A cheerful laughter came from afar.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\nOrganizations:\n\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n共产党  Communist Party\n\nPlaces:\n\n淮安  Huai'an\n石塘区  Shithang District\n色桥西  Seqiao West\n徐庄  Xu Village\n杨柳唐  Yang Liutang\n舒大庄  Shu Village\n鹅钱乡  Eqian Township\n邱大庄  Qiu Village\n二字沟  Erzigo\n西刘圩  Xiliuwei\n头子沟  Touzigo\n三子沟  Sanzigo\n马庄村  Wei Village\n\nPeople:\n\n刘鸿如  Liu Hongru\n赵必文  Zhao Biwen\n魏景元  Wei Jingyuan\n金步云  Jin Buyun\n李凤英  Li Fengying\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 石塘人们的新生——新华社淮安通讯\n\n1946-05-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　石塘人们的新生——新华社淮安通讯\n    淮安石塘区群众运动，本社前已有报导，这篇通讯系叙述群众运动后，人民如何选举政府、如何加紧生产的情形。——编者           \n    天大的喜事\n    在石塘区这次减租惩奸运动中，许多大地主算退租帐时，因退不出粮，自愿以一部田地抵算，因此佃户获得了少数土地，这在大地主们是无足轻重的，但在佃户却是件天大的喜事。\n    佃户们几十年来，不，甚至几百年，几千年来，就不曾有过土地，他们的父亲、祖父乃至曾祖，一直是种人家田的，正如许多佃户所说：“连登尿马子的地方都是主人的，也要包租。”\n    但是现在呢？许多佃户有了屋基，“登尿马子的地方”再也不是主人的了。\n    色桥西徐庄佃户们开胜利翻身大会，鞭炮连天响，花船高跷子浪过来又浪过去，他们热狂地为他们这件天大的喜事而庆祝。\n    “恭喜！恭喜！”佃户们一进会场，都拱手笑着互相道贺。\n    杨柳唐过去受苦弄了些钱，想买二亩屋基，但穷人是买不到田的，终于给地主刘鸿如垫价买去了。刘鸿如对他说：“你有命买田，无命买天！”（意思是说穷人有钱买田，但天下不是穷人的，田仍旧买不到的），这次算退租帐，刘愿以田抵算。\n    地主们给佃户做了新“契”，佃户们拿着新契都讨论着如何等到麦收下来以后到政府去“税”，他们把“契”当做一份珍贵的天书藏起来，有的佃户把“契”拿给这个人看看，又拿给那个人看看，逢人就说：“现在可翻身啦！”那些年纪大的老爷爷，激动地说：“我们那一世有过田的啊！”\n    他们第一次做主人\n    选乡长这在石塘区鹅钱乡还是从古到今第一次！\n    老百姓过去根本没听说过选乡长这件事，以为“乡长就是上面派下来的官。”\n    但在这次减租以后，老百姓的思想发生了变化，他们想：“现在民主来了，人民自己要做主，要想彻底翻身，就要有老百姓自己的带头的乡长。”\n    八十几个代表，他们带着全乡人民的希望，带着一双锐利的眼睛，在舒大庄选乡长了。\n    代表们很多是妇女，她们今天特别高兴，因为她们也参加了选举。\n    代表们的眼睛像透视的镜子，钉住他们提出的候选人转，选那个好呢？\n    七个行政委员选出来了，是非常郑重地选出来的，其中贫农两个，抗属、士绅、工人、中农、富农各一个，赵必文做了乡长。\n    新选的委员站在台前忸忸怩怩的，代表们像看新娘子似的，贪婪的看着他们新选出的领袖，掌声与欢笑混成一片。\n    “你们以后要好好帮我们办事，”代表又当场对新选的委员提出意见，“要领导我们求得彻底翻身，有什么事不能独断独行，要通过大家商量，这是我们的希望”……\n    “我是个泥腿子（苏北土语，意即农民），大家既然选举我，我要给大家好好地办事。”赵必文代表全体委员接受了意见，说话脸红红的，像个大闺女：“以后希望大家多帮助，若我们有不对的地方，各位马上提出帮助改正，若对我们不提，害了我，也害了大家”。\n    代表们离开会场回去，走在路上还在谈，还在笑，因为他们今天是第一次做了主人。\n    下劲闹生产\n    石塘区邱大庄二十一个乡民，在二字沟挖沟，他们全是刚翻身的农民，他们想：“今年一定要栽秋，可不能像去年一样的荒下去”。\n    有些人站在沟底，有些人站在沟沿下，淤泥从沟底上用锹向岸上传送着，传送着，沟底的人裤管卷在膝盖上，两脚满是泥浆，像穿了一双长统乌黑的皮鞋。\n    他们在笑，他们在工作，心里的欢悦止不住从他们的笑声中泄露出来，温和的春风吹去了他们脸上的愁苦。\n    这条沟二年没有挖过，再不挖还想栽秧吗？\n    真的，二字沟的淤泥已积了二三尺深，这条沟是通过河的，每年两岸的田都是指望它的水呢！\n    “自从共产党来，”魏景元一锹把泥摔到岸上，“人民就有了日子过，领导人民翻身，领导人民生产，全是为人民啊！”\n    魏景元抹掉了头上的汗，望着紧靠邱大庄西边的西刘圩，他说：“听说刘圩子各家已订出生产计划，买猪、割草、挖沟、修车，预备下劲闹生产啦！”\n    “我们要走在头里下劲闹啊！我们邱大庄，挖沟还想带朵大红花呢！”魏景元是队长，他笑着鼓励大家，他们在大会上曾提出比较，谁好谁快就带大红花。\n    “头子沟和三子沟规定别的庄子挖，为什么，还不动工呢？”“我们闹好推他一把，不愁他不挖呢！”\n    金步云向南望了一望，忽然说：“喂马庄村也动工了，头子沟是马村负责的，”大家听他一说，头都抬起来向南望，果然从碧绿的秧浪上望过去，远远的沟沿上露出几个人头，一块一块的泥土正在规律地从沟底飞到岸上。\n    现在提到生产那个不高兴，现在大家苦都苦得有劲，大家看到马庄村也动了工，都兴奋起来。\n    “那个不高兴，现在苦也苦得有个盼头。”李凤英站在沟底下挖了一锹泥，她跟男子汉一样地在挖沟。\n    “好，三年以后，看我们这里是怎样的一个地方。”魏景元骄傲地说着，大家的脑海里都浮现出一幅非常美丽的远景，他们都笑了。\n    傍晚太阳还有丈把高，大家坐在河岸上休息，抽着旱烟。\n    “今天闹好了三十丈了！”\n    “怎么样歇工吧？”\n    “不再闹一小段？”\n    “好，就再闹一小段。”\n    大家又跳下沟。几十个小孩子、大姑娘在麦田里抢着拔青草，准备回去作肥料，闹嚷嚷的远远地传来了一片欢愉的笑声。"

In Xinji, Si (County)-Shu (yang) County, and Hukou, Donghai, in the Sixth Administrative Region, more than 10,000 people held anti-civil war rallies on the 8th. In Si County, the Seventh Administrative Region, 6,000 soldiers and civilians held a rally on the 8th, resolving to defend themselves, expose spies, and intensify air defense. More than a thousand people in Xin'an Town on the Longhai Railway held an anti-civil war march on the 9th, shouting slogans resolutely opposing civil war and defending peace. In Shuyang and Dingfeng, gentry also convened current affairs symposiums on the 8th. At the meeting, Zhu Jintang and others vehemently denounced the stubborn factions that launched the civil war and praised the liberated areas that were engaged in peaceful construction. The Qingjiang City Chamber of Commerce Preparation Committee sent a letter to the Huaiyin Executive Headquarters on the 15th, requesting it to uphold justice and stop the civil war. The Children's Corps of Lianshui County began anti-civil war propaganda from the 20th.

It is reported that the 400,000 coal miners initially began a strike on April 1st, which lasted for six weeks. They temporarily resumed work after government mediation, with a 40-day limit for negotiations with mine owners. However, the mine owners still insisted on rejecting the workers' reasonable demands, causing the negotiations to break down, thus the strike has restarted. The 400,000 coal miners' resumption of the strike coincides with the passage of the reactionary anti-labor bill by the American Congress. The coal miners' strike will exacerbate the national crisis caused by the general strike of railway workers. The American national newspapers have suffered a serious blow due to the railway and coal mine strikes. Many newspapers have cancelled their advertising sections, and the page sizes have also been reduced. For example, the Los Angeles Times published eight pages on Saturday, without any advertisements, and stated that the page size will be further reduced in the future. The Howard newspaper chain announced that the Pittsburgh News, Washington Daily, and others will cancel advertisements starting today.\n    Another Dispatch: Railway workers, whose strike has caused huge losses to the United States, ended their strike on the 25th, having obtained an increase of 18.5 cents per hour.\n    [Xinhua News Agency Yan'an, 27th Dispatch] According to London Broadcasting: After 250,000 American railway workers announced their strike on the 24th, the American Congress immediately passed an anti-labor bill, granting the President extraordinary powers, namely, the power to order the cessation of strikes in state-run industrial sectors.

    "content": "On the Great Strike in the United States\n    Liu Zunqi\n    I. The Atomic Bomb of American Society\n    The American labor unrest that followed the end of the war, starting with disputes over partial wages, turned into local strikes. Local strikes developed into large-scale strikes in monopolistic industries such as electricity and steel. The largest strike in the United States in the past was in 1937, when the number of strikers was only over 500,000. This time, the number of workers directly stopping work, until recently, reached 1,786,000, more than three times that of 1937, hailed as an unprecedented great strike in the United States.\n    At the same time, the 1,300 factories belonging to U.S. Steel Corporation, distributed in 33 states, are the most important source of materials for the nation's basic industries. Basic industries that depend on it for production, such as shipbuilding, automobile manufacturing, and machinery manufacturing, employed 5.34 million workers according to 1941 statistics. If the steel strike continues for a long time, all these basic industry workers will inevitably stop working, and the impact may evolve into a major crisis in American industrial production.\n    Because the impact and scale of the strike were too significant, the U.S. government had to actively mediate. Thus, President Truman's policies regarding labor, profits, prices, and the American industrial production system became the focus of attention. If Truman's mediation succeeds, satisfying both labor and management in resolving the dispute, he might be able to maintain the public support that President Roosevelt had in his later years; if his mediation fails or only favors one side, he and the Democratic Party will lose public support. We know that Roosevelt's third election was basically due to the workers' votes. If Truman loses the support of the workers, given the broad power of American labor unions today, he will inevitably be isolated and helpless. Although he has three years left in his term, a third of the members of Congress will be re-elected at the end of this year, and whether the workers support him or not will have a decisive effect on his future political fate. In this respect, this great strike is indeed full of strong political significance.\n    In addition, this great strike can be said to have been conceived during the war. Due to the end of the war, all the causes were stimulated, leading to today's turbulent situation, which is by no means accidental. Capitalists want to maintain the lucrative profits of the war boom and are unwilling to relax even after the war ends, instead reducing the actual income of workers. During the war, the labor side saw a large amount of profit being seized by capitalists, and naturally felt resentful, but after all, in order to concentrate on increasing production and defeating the fascist enemy as early as possible, they tolerated the burden as long as they could make a living. But now that the war is over, they have to compete with the capitalists for their own long-term survival and better living conditions. This is the inherent root of the American capitalist production system at its peak, and anyone who pays a little attention would have foreseen that it would inevitably erupt during the post-war recovery period. In today's world where production economies are rapidly leaning towards socialism, the great strike in the United States cannot but be considered to contain the meaning of social revolution, and can also be said to be an atomic bomb hidden inside American society.\n    II. Excessive Disparity Between Labor and Capital\n    According to official U.S. government surveys, the average annual total profit of manufacturing companies in the pre-war period (1936-1939) was $2,142.2 million. This year (1946), if companies are willing to increase wages by 14 percent, they can have a profit of $6.3 billion after taxes, which is three times that of the pre-war period. Even if wages are increased by 24 percent, companies can still achieve a profit of $4.8 billion this year, which is more than twice that of the pre-war period.\n    The initial demand of American striking workers was to increase wages by 30 percent. According to the above statistics, even if capitalists fully accept this demand, they can still maintain twice the pre-war profits, excluding all taxes. Recently, the U.S. excess profits tax law is about to be abolished. If they do not pay the excess profits tax, American capitalists still have the ability to increase wages by another 10 percent, while still maintaining twice the pre-war profits.\n    As for companies outside of manufacturing, such as wholesale, retail, service, and other enterprises, according to government surveys, profits in 1946 can reach $10.2 billion, which is also equal to three times the pre-war period. Before the war, the average annual profit of these industries was $3,399.9 million.\n    American capitalists have obtained staggering profits during the four years of war. Their appetites have grown. Although all industries have shifted to peacetime production, they stubbornly maintain three times the pre-war profits. This is what workers are most unbearable about at present.\n    What is the income situation of American workers?\n    The average nominal weekly wage per person for workers in manufacturing was $26.64 in January 1941; $47.12 in April 1945. Superficially, it increased by 77 percent (but the capitalists' profits tripled!).\n    In reality, due to rising prices and income tax payments, the average weekly wage actually received was $31.47, which is only 18 percent higher than in 1941.\n    As soon as the war ended, capitalists cancelled overtime pay, and workers' salaries were reduced across the board. The average nominal weekly wage fell to only $33.96. Thus, the actual wage of workers decreased by 28 percent compared to the actual wage in April 1945. After paying income tax, the purchasing power of the $33.96 nominal weekly wage that workers receive under today's high prices is only equivalent to $23.95, which is a decrease of 10 percent compared to January 1941.\n    In other words, the capitalists' profits have tripled; the workers' wages have increased by 10 percent—this is the most direct cause of the current labor unrest.\n    The main demand of the workers in the current strike factories is: the wages for a normal 40-hour work week should be approximately the same as the wages for a 48-hour work week during the war. The highest demand is no more than 30 percent, and the lowest is no more than 20 percent.\n    The capitalists insist that this increase is impossible, on the grounds that most prices are still limited, the entire production during peacetime has not yet been on track, and costs cannot be accurately calculated.\n    This dispute almost began after Japan's surrender.\n    III. The Course of the Great Strike\n    On August 18 last year, 200,000 workers of General Motors Company began to make demands for wage increases. The management fundamentally refused to consider it, and the two sides confronted each other for two or three months. All workers began to strike on November 21, and it has been two and a half months now.\n    336,000 meatpacking workers also made demands for wage increases on the 11th, but the management had no sincerity to consider it, and finally began to strike on January 16. On January 23, Truman ordered the federal government to take over all meatpacking factories involved in the labor unrest in order to maintain social meat consumption. However, because the government did not change wages, most of the workers did not return to work.\n    The General Electric Company strike began on January 15, with approximately 200,000 workers participating. When the electrical workers went on strike, the 263,000 telephone workers and operators across the country held a sympathy strike, but soon returned to work.\n    The mainstream of the current strike is still the 750,000 steelworkers. Their wage increase demands were proposed as early as September. After labor-management negotiations and government mediation, there were no results. Initially, the steelworkers' union decided to strike on January 14, but because Truman designated an agency to try to mediate, the workers reduced the amount of the wage increase from 25 percent to 15 percent, and only demanded an increase of 19.5 cents per hour. The management conceded to 17.5 cents. The government's \"fact-finding group\" suggested an increase of 18.5 cents, which the labor side had already accepted, but the management firmly refused. The difference of only one cent led to the great steel strike. It has been almost a month since it began on January 20. During this period, some steel mills in the western United States individually signed contracts with the union to increase wages by 18.5 cents, but only tens of thousands of people have returned to work in this way.\n    The current labor unrest is not only in a serious stalemate; but new strikes are still continuing. On February 4, 3,500 barge workers in New York went on strike, and 35,000 dockworkers unanimously supported it, while launching a sympathy strike, causing the entire transportation in New York Harbor to be suspended, and the city's food and fuel supply was severely hit.\n    On the same day, workers from the six major milk companies in Kansas also voted to strike because their request for a 29-cent increase was unsuccessful.\n    An entire city of workers, called Stanwait (Connecticut), numbering 10,000, held a sympathy general strike for one day to support the machine workers who had been on strike since November 8. This is a dramatic event in this great strike.\n    IV. Several Characteristics\n    There are several noteworthy characteristics of this great strike in the United States that should be pointed out. These characteristics have a profound impact on the future political and economic development of the United States and the labor movement.\n    First, the united front of workers.\n    There are two major labor organizations in the United States: one is the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), whose leader is Murray. Its political consciousness is very strong, with strong progressive views. Domestically, it is the backbone of the National Political Action Committee, supporting all progressive and democratic measures. Abroad, it supports international labor organizations and the movement for world peace and collective security. The other major labor organization is the American Federation of Labor (AFL). This is a right-leaning group that is anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and opposes participating in foreign affairs. These two major groups are competing for leadership in the national labor movement and rarely cooperate on overall issues. However, the wave of strikes this time is being carried out jointly and consistently by them. For example, the meatpacking workers' strike was first launched by 200,000 members belonging to the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and then 135,000 workers belonging to the American Federation of Labor jointly responded and acted consistently. The general strike in Stanford City (⑴⑵) mentioned above was completely consistent among members of the two major groups.\n    Second, opposition to the unrestricted seizure of profits, taking into account the sound economy of society. If prices rise along with wage increases, not only will the actual income of workers not be improved, but the general public will also suffer. The two groups leading the great strike in the United States this time, while insisting on the demand for wage increases, solemnly expressed their opposition to raising prices. That is to say, they only want capitalists to take out a portion of their profits to subsidize workers' lives, instead of blindly increasing superficial salaries as in the past, and they are even more unwilling to burden the general public as a result.\n    The boss of General Motors Company stated on this point: unless the wage increase is counted as a new cost and the selling price of goods is increased accordingly, not a single cent of wages can be increased. The workers firmly oppose this attitude. They oppose passing on the wage increase to the burden of general consumers, so that capitalists can still maintain their original generous profits.\n    This kind of social consciousness shown by American workers is very noteworthy. In the past and even now, there is still a faction of union leaders in the United States, such as Lewis of the coal miners' union, who only care about demanding wage increases, regardless of how high the capitalists raise the selling price, and do not care about it, and have lost most of the sympathy of society. In this great strike, American public groups have set up porridge shops everywhere to provide free meals to striking workers, which proves that their new strategy is very successful. Because they have united their own interests with the interests of the majority of the people in society.\n    Third, the problems of the American capitalist production system have been raised.\n    Workers' demands for wage increases under the principle of not raising prices have already marked a new stage for the American labor movement. But equally important is the American government's mediation method, which puts the issues of wages, profits, and price adjustments in American capitalist production on the agenda of future American socio-economic movements.\n    Truman announced on December 3 the method of mediating the labor unrest, which is divided into two items: (1) For any enterprise where labor unrest has occurred, the government may send impartial people to establish a \"fact-finding group\" to investigate whether the company has the ability to increase wages. Although he did not require the company to \"open the books\" to accept public investigation, he stated that \"there is no reason for the company not to cooperate with this investigation work.\" (2) He hopes that workers will have a \"calm period\" of about 30 days before the \"fact-finding group\" completes its work, and that they will not strike.\n    This method was attacked by both labor and management. The management opposed the former, and the labor opposed the latter. However, the labor side later stated that if the capitalists are willing to open the books to allow society to check whether they have the ability to increase wages, the labor is willing to respect the government's mediation.\n    Investigating the company's books to determine whether the company should pay more wages was originally not something that the government had the right to handle, unless Congress specifically granted the president this privilege. Therefore, General Motors Company published a huge advertisement in national newspapers on January 5, saying that \"the method of investigating the books will sooner or later develop to such a day that the existing corporate privileges will be deprived by labor to the fullest extent.\" And said that Truman's theory of \"deciding how much wages should be increased based on the ability to pay wages\" would \"completely subvert the entire American free enterprise system.\" They believe that maintaining as much profit as possible is the only stimulus for American free enterprise, and keeping the secrets of profit and letting the capitalists decide the amount of wages themselves is a sacred and inviolable right of capitalism.\n    So far, Truman has designated \"fact-finding groups\" in several enterprises involved in labor unrest, but because the companies have always refused to check the accounts, this work cannot provide the most complete and powerful evidence. The investigators can only base their conclusions on government tax figures and the facts and figures provided by the union. None of their conclusions have been adopted by the management.\n    Here arises the issue of President Truman's credibility. If the \"fact-finding\" policy continues to fail in this way, the labor unrest will inevitably continue to expand, and the future is really unpredictable. If Truman insists on implementing this policy, he must face the major issue of \"revision of American capitalism.\" The unions now unanimously support Truman's \"accounting check\" policy. Whether Du has the courage to ask Congress to interfere with the privileges of capitalist administration is a question of great importance in the future.\n    V. Conclusion\n    The world economy is still in a state of coexistence of socialist and capitalist systems. However, due to the great success of Soviet socialism and its amazing victory in Europe, many European countries have gradually transformed from the decadent capitalist shells, adopting socialist programs to varying degrees. Like Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Hungary, parts of Germany and Austria, Czechoslovakia, although the private property system still exists, the nationalization of land distribution and heavy industry, forests, minerals, and transportation is no longer a purely capitalist mode of production. Even in France and Britain, the nationalization of public utilities is also being implemented step by step, and the government is limiting the amount of profits of private enterprises in order to protect the public interest.\n    The only major power in the world that rigidly adheres to the capitalist profit-seeking mode of production is the United States. In the United States, free enterprise has long been occupied by a few cartel monopoly capital. American capitalist democracy has long lost its soul due to the lack of economic democracy. This great strike can also be said to be a struggle for workers to win economic democracy. In this regard, it has profound global significance.\n    February 5, 1946\n    (This article is reprinted from the North Ping \"World Knowledge\" ×× volume ×× issue)\n\n**Named

同时，美国钢铁公司所属的一千三百家工厂，分布在三十三个州，是全国基本工业的最重要材料来源。依赖它而生产的基本工业，如造船、造车、机器制造等，根据一九四一年的统计，已雇用五百三十四万工人。如果钢铁业的罢工旷日持久下去，所有这些基本工业的工人，势将停止工作，影响所及，可能演成美国工业生产的重大危机。\n    由于罢工影响和规模过于重大，美国政府不能不积极调处，于是杜鲁门总统对于劳工、对于利润、对于物价、对于美国的工业生产制度所采取的政策，就成为各方注目的焦点。倘若杜鲁门的调处成功，使得劳资满意解决争端，他或许还能保持罗斯福总统后半期的公众支持；如果他的调处失败，或只偏袒了一方面，他和民主党就会失却公众的支持。我们知道，罗斯福第三任当选，基本上是靠工人的投票。杜鲁门如果失却工人的支持，在今天美国工会的广大势力之下，必定孤立无援。虽然他的任期还有三年，但是今年年底就要有三分之一的会议员改选，工人支持不支持，对他今后施政的命运，有决定的作用。在这一点上，这一次的大罢工实在富有浓厚的政治意义。\n    此外这一次的大罢工可以说是在战争期间内就孕育了下来，由于战争的结束，一切原因都激发出来，以至演成今日奔腾澎湃之局，决不是偶然发生的。资本家要保持战争繁荣期的肥美利润，虽在战争终了后，仍不肯放松一步，反来减削工人的实际收入。劳工方面在战争期内，看到大量利润给资本家攫夺去了，自然很愤恨，但毕竟为了集中全力增加生产，好提早击败法西斯敌人，只要生活得下去，也就隐忍负重了。但战争既已完结，却不得不为本身长期的生存，和较好的生活，而与资本家一争短长。这是达于烂熟期的美国资本主义生产制度的内在病根，凡是稍加留心的人，早就会预见到在战后复员时期必然要暴发的。在全世界生产经济急剧倾向于社会主义方面的今天，美国的大罢工不能不认为含有社会革命的意义，也可以说是美国社会内部藏着的一颗原子弹。\n    二  劳资悬殊过甚\n    根据美国政府的官方调查，美国制造工业的公司，在战前（一九三六——一九三九）每年平均的利润总额是二十一万万四千二百万元。在今年（一九四六）年内，公司如肯增加工资百分之十四，除了捐税外，可有利润六十三万万元，就是说战前的三倍。即使增加工资百分之二十四，公司今年的利润也可以达到四十八亿元，即为战前的二倍以上。\n    美国罢工工人的最初要求是增加工资百分之三十。依照上面的统计，资本家纵使完全接收这个要求，也还可以保持战前利润的两倍，一切捐税除开在外。最近美国的过分利得税法就要取销了，如果不缴过分利得税，美国资本家还有能力再增加百分之十的工资，而依然保持战前利润的两倍。\n    至于制造业以外的公司，如批发、零售、服务等企业，据政府调查，一九四六年内利润可达一百零二万万元，也等于战前的三倍。战前这些工业每年平均利润是三十三亿九千九百万元。\n    美国资本家在四年战争期间已经获得惊人的利润，他们的胃口已经养大了，虽然一切工业转入和平时期的生产，但仍执拗地维持战前三倍的利润。这是目前工人最不堪忍受的事。\n    美国的工人收入情形怎样呢？\n    在制造业中的工人，平均每星期每人的名义工资，一九四一年一月间是二六·六四元；一九四五年四月是四七·一二元。表面上增加了百分之七十七（资本家的利润却是三倍！）。\n    实际上，由于物价高涨和缴纳所得税之故，平均每周的工资，实得三一·四七元，即较一九四一年仅增高百分之十八。\n    战争一结束，资本家把赶工费取消了，工人的薪阶一律降低，平均每周的名义工资只落得三三·九六元。这样，工人的实际工资较一九四五年四月的实际工资减少了百分之二八。除了交纳所得税，工人在今天的高物价下每周所得三三、九六元名义工资的购买力，只合得到二三·九五元，即反较一九四一年一月减少了百分之十。\n    换句话说，资本家的利润增加了三倍；工人的工资增加了百分之十——这是当前工潮最直接的原因。\n    目前几个罢工厂的工人要求，主要在一点：即平时每周四十小时工作的工资，应与战时每周四十八小时的工资差不多。最高的要求不过百分之三十，最低的不过百分之二十。\n    资本家则坚持这种增加是不可能的，理由是物价大部还是限定着的，平时的全部生产还未上轨道，成本不能精确计算出来。\n    这个争执差不多在日本投降后就开始了。\n    三  大罢工经过\n    去年八月十八日通用汽车公司的二十万工人开始提出增资的要求，资方根本拒绝考虑，双方相持了两三个月。十一月二十一日全体工人开始罢工到现在已是两个半月了。\n    肉类装制工人三十三万六千人，也是在十一日间就提出了增资要求的，资方毫无考虑的诚意，终于一月十六日起开始罢工，一月二十三日杜鲁门下令由联邦政府接收所有卷入工潮的肉类工厂，以维持社会肉类消费。但因政府不变更工资，工人大部分都没有复工。\n    通用电气公司的罢工是从一月十五日开始，参加工人约二十万。当电气工人罢工时，全国二十六万三千电话工人和接线生虽举行同情罢工，未几又复工。\n    目前罢工的主流还是七十五万钢铁工人。他们的增资要求是早在九月间即已提出，经过劳资折冲，政府调处，毫无结果。最初钢铁工会决议于一月十四日起罢工，后因杜鲁门指定机构试图调解，工人把增资的数目从百分之二十五降低至百分之十五，每小时工资只要求增加一角九分五。资方让步到一角七分五。政府的“事实调查组”调处建议增加一角八分五，工方业已接受，但资方坚决拒绝，只差一分钱之微，酿成钢铁业的大罢工。从一月二十日开始转瞬也快一个月了。在这期间，美国西部一些钢铁厂个别的与工会签订增资一角八分五的合同，但这样复工的不过几万人。\n    目前的工潮不但在严重僵持之中；而且新的罢工还在继续不已。二月四日起纽约的驳船工人三千五百名实行罢工，码头工人三万五千人一致支援，同时发动了同情罢工，以致纽约港的运输为之整个停顿，全市的食物和燃料供应，受到了严重打击。\n    同一天内，甘萨斯的六大牛奶公司工人因要求增资二角九分未遂，也已表决罢工。\n    一个叫做斯丹伟特的小城（康纳第可特州）全体工人一万人，为了声援从十一月八日起开始罢工的机械工人，曾举行同情总罢工一天。这是这次大罢工中个富有戏剧意味的事件。\n    四  几个特点\n    这一次美国的大罢工有几个最可注意的特点，应该指出。这些特点与美国今后的政治经济发展和劳工运动都有很深刻的影响。\n    第一，工人的联合阵线。\n    美国顶大的劳工组织有两个：一个是产业团体大会（也有人译作工业组织大会，即CIO Congress of Industrial Organizations）领袖是慕莱，它的政治意识很强，有浓厚的进步性，在国内为全国政治行动委员会的骨干，支持一切进步民主的措施；在国外，支持国际劳工的组织，支持世界和平与集体安全的运动。另外一个大的劳工组织，是美国劳工联合会，即AFLAmerican Federation of Labor。这是一个右倾的团体，反苏，反共，反对参加国外的事务。这两大团体在全国工运中在争领导地位，很少在全面问题上合作。但是这回罢工的浪潮，却是它们联合一致进行的。例如肉类装制工人的罢工，先是属于产业团体大会的二十万会员发起的，随着属于美国劳工联合会的十三万五千工人便联合响应，一致行动。上述斯丹佛特城（⑴⑵）的总罢工，两大团体的会员完全是一致的。\n    第二，反对无限制的利润攫夺，顾及到社会的健全经济。如果工资增加之后，物价随之增涨，不但工人实际的收入并无补益，而且使一般社会公众受累。美国这次领导大罢工的两个团体，在坚持增加工资的要求时，严正表示反对增高物价。这就是说，他们只是要资本家拿出一部分利润来贴补工人生活，而不象过去那样肓目地仅仅增加表面的薪给而已，更不愿因此而累及社会一般公众。\n    通用汽车公司的老板对这一点表示：除非把工资的增加，算作新的成本，照数提高物品的售价，否则一分钱工资都能不能增加。工人坚决反对这个态度。他们反对把工资的增加部分转嫁到一般消耗者的负担上去，而使资本家依然维持他们原来的丰厚利润。\n    美国工人的这一种社会意识的表现，是非常可注意的。过去以至现在美国还有一派工会领袖，例如煤矿工会的鲁易士之流，只顾要求增资，不管资本家把售价提高到多么高，却不去过问，曾经失掉社会的大部同情。这回大罢工中间，美国民众团体在各地纷纷设立粥厂免费给罢工工人用膳，就证明他们的新战略是很成功的。因为他们把自己的利益和社会上大多数人民的利益统一了起来。\n    第三，美国资本主义生产制度问题被提出来了。\n    工人要求在不提高物价的原则之下增加工资，已经为美国的工运划出了一个新的阶段。但同样有的，是美国政府的调解方式，把美国资本主义生产中的意义工资、利润、和物价的调整问题，提到今后美国社会经济运动的课程表上来了。\n    杜鲁门于十二月三日宣布调处工潮的办法，分为两项：（一）对于任何发生了工潮的企业，政府得派公正人士设立“事实调查组”，调查公司有无能力增加工资。他虽没有要求公司必需把“帐簿打开”来，接受公开的调查，但他表示“公司没有理由不和这种调查工作合作”。（二）他希望在“事实调查组”工作完成前，工人有一个“镇静期间”，大约为三十天，不得罢工。\n    这个办法受到了劳资双方的夹攻。资方反对前者，劳方反对后者。不过后来劳方表示，倘若资本家肯把帐簿打开让社会检查有无增加工资的能力，则劳工愿尊重政府的调处。\n    调验公司的帐簿，以确定公司应否付出更多的工资，原不是政府有权办理的事，除非国会特别授与总统这种特权。所以通用汽车公司于一月五日在全国报纸刊登巨幅广告，说“调验帐簿的办法，迟早会发展到这么一天，那时现有的公司特权都要被劳工剥夺以尽。”并且说杜鲁门的“根据支付工资能力来决定应加多少工资”的理论，“会把美国全部自由企业制度颠覆无遗”的。他们认为保持利润越多越好，是美国自由企业的唯一刺激因素，而保守利润的秘密，由资本家自己决定工资的数目，更是资本主义神圣不可侵犯的权力。\n    迄今为止，杜鲁门已经在几个卷入工潮的企业中指定了“事实调查组”，但因为公司始终拒绝查帐，这种工作就不能提供最完整有力的证据。调查人员只能根据政府税收数字与工会所提供的事实和数字，他们的结论没有一次被资方采纳过。\n    这里就发生了杜鲁门总统的威信问题。如果“事实调查”政策这样失败下去，工潮必将持续扩大，前途实在不可逆料。如果杜鲁门坚持贯彻这一政策，他就必须面对着“美国资本主义的修正”的重大问题。工会现在是一致支持杜鲁门的“查帐”政策的。杜氏有无勇气向国会要求干涉资本家行政的特权，是今后极可重视的一个问题。\n    五  结语\n    世界经济还是在社会主义与资本主义两大体系的并存状态中。但是由于苏联社会主义的伟大成功，它在欧洲的惊人胜利，许多欧洲的国家，已经渐次从颓唐的资本主义躯壳中蜕变，或多或少地采行着社会主义的方案。象波兰、罗马尼亚、南斯拉夫、保加利亚、匈牙利、一部分德国和奥国，捷克斯拉夫，虽然私有财产制度照旧存在，但土地分配和重工业与森林、矿产、交通的国家化，已经不再是单纯的资本主义生产方式了。甚至于法国和英国，公用企业的国有化也在着着实行，政府为了保障公众利益，对私人企业的利润多少都在加以限制。\n    一成不变地牢守着资本主义利润追求的生产方式，在世界主要列强中，只有一个美国了。在美国，自由企业早已为少数卡迭尔的垄断资本所霸占了。美国资本主义的民主，早已因缺乏经济的民主而失去了灵魂。这一次大罢工，也可以说是工人争取经济民主的斗争。在这一点上，是具有深刻的世界意义的。\n    一九四六年二月五日\n    （此文系转载北平《世界知识》××卷××期）"

    "content": "机关 Production of the Border Government and Central Bureau\n    Li Zhuang\n    The border region-level organs moved to Handan. The people of Handan then saw more ordinary yet novel things. Whenever the setting sun leaned against the mountains, groups of staff members wearing \"Border Region Government\" badges and blue uniforms, carrying hoes and manure buckets, went from the city to the suburbs. At dusk, they returned with cheerful and weary steps.\n    The citizens felt extraordinarily surprised by this: \"How can they still be doing these things!\" These well-intentioned people may not be very clear that the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War were endured through such arduous fighting, work, and production. Anti-Japanese military and government personnel shed a lot of blood and sweat to defeat the Japanese invaders. Now that victory has been achieved, the common people are still very poor due to the enemy's and puppet's eight years of exploitation. Therefore, the government decided to launch a large-scale production movement to reduce the burden on the people. Each odd-job worker in the border government only receives four yuan for food expenses per day. Four yuan can now only buy half a catty of bean sprouts or enough coal to cook one meal. Everything else must be solved through self-production.\n    In the midst of busy work, this is obviously a heavy burden. But the people who are determined to \"serve the people\" bravely bear it. In addition to the overall organ production, the border government requires each person to produce and turn over 2,700 yuan this year. The Central Bureau's production plan pointed out a clear direction, their total production task is ×××10,000 yuan, and commercial production only accounts for 18%. That is to say, to complete 82% of the production task depends on their own labor.\n    The plan is being carried out intensely. The border government's organ land has been planted with 132 mu, most of which is cotton. They transported soil and carried bricks for public construction sites, earning more than 100,000 yuan, completing one-tenth of the entire task. The most active comrades have already completed 1,700 yuan. The Department of Education has only eighteen people, and they planted four mu of cotton and two mu of vegetables themselves. There are only two hours or so of labor time each day, and the residence is more than half a kilometer away from the farm. It is obviously not easy to cultivate so much land under such conditions. But according to current estimates, the vegetable garden harvest alone can complete the private production task. The Central Bureau planted 110 mu of land, and continuously transports bricks and contracts projects. The female comrades spin cotton, coupled with the organ's transportation, workshops, commercial production and other projects, it is estimated that the task can also be completed satisfactorily.\n    Before coming to Handan and after arriving in Handan, party, government, and military leaders frequently reminded their cadres to prevent waste and be vigilant against hedonistic thoughts. I simply visited the production situation of various organs, and everyone still maintains the glorious tradition of hard struggle during the Anti-Japanese War. Despite the difficulties such as relocation, lack of land, and frequent cadre transfers, relying on eight years of training and experience, production is being carried out enthusiastically.\n    Taking the border government as an example: before moving to Handan, Chairman Yang mobilized all cadres for arduous production. Chairman Yang and Rong also have production tasks. They exchanged labor with cadres and odd-job personnel, and turned over all manuscript fees. Some general affairs personnel went to Handan in advance to prepare. Before finding land, everyone planned to contract projects for others first. After finding land, they immediately grasped the farming season for agricultural production. They established a production committee, strictly divided the work, some specialized in contacting contracted projects, and some were responsible for preparing agricultural tools and seeds. The production team under the committee directly led the production personnel. Everyone had production training and had obtained production benefits. After the call and organization leadership of the leaders, they immediately took action.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n　\n邯郸  Handan\n边区政府   Border Region Government\n抗日战争   Anti-Japanese War\n人民服务   Serve the People\n中央局   Central Bureau\n杨主席   Chairman Yang\n戎主席   Chairman Rong\n教育厅   Department of Education\n中国共产党   Chinese Communist Party\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 边府、中央局的机关生产\n李庄\n1946-05-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　边府、中央局的机关生产\n    李庄\n    边区一级的机关搬到了邯郸。邯郸人于是看到了更多平凡而又新奇的事情。每当夕阳傍山的时候，一群群挂着“边区政府”证章和穿着蓝色制服的工作人员，荷锄担粪，从市内去到郊外去。黄昏，他们又迈着愉快而疲惫的步子赶回来。\n    市民们对这件事感到分外的惊奇：“怎么他们还干这些事！”这些好心的人也许还不很清楚，八年的抗战就是在这样艰苦的打仗、工作与生产中熬过去的。抗日的军政人员为战胜日寇而流了大量的血汗。现在胜利了，可是由于敌伪八年压榨，老百姓依然十分困苦，政府于是决定了开展大生产运动，减轻人民负担的方针。边府每个工杂人员每天只发四元菜金。四元钱在现在只能买半斤豆芽或作熟一顿饭的煤炭。其他一切都要靠自己生产解决。\n    在繁忙的工作中，这显然是个沉重的担子。但是决心为“人民服务”的人们勇敢的承受了它。边府除了整个的机关生产外，今年每人要生产交公两千七百元。中央局的生产计划指出了一个明确的方向，他们的生产总任务是×××万元，商业生产只占百分之十八。就是说，完成百分之八十二的生产任务要靠自己的劳力。\n    计划在紧张的进行着。边府的机关土地已下种一百三十二亩，其中大部是棉花，他们给进行公共建筑的场所运土抬砖，先后赚了十多万元，已完成整个任务的十分之一，最积极的同志已经完成一千七百元。教育厅只有十八个人，自己种了四亩棉花两亩菜。每天只有两点多钟的劳作时间，驻地离农场又有一里多路。这样的条件耕种这样多的土地，显然很不容易。但据现在的估计，只是菜地收获就能完成私人生产任务。中央局种了一百一十亩地，还不断运砖、包工，女同志们纺棉花，再加上机关的运输、作坊，商业生产等项目，估计也能圆满的完成任务。\n    来邯前和到邯郸以后，党政军首长们经常提醒自己的干部：防止浪费、警惕享乐思想。我简单的访问各机关的生产情况，大家依然保持着抗战中艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，尽管有搬家、缺乏土地、干部调动频繁等困难，但依靠着八年的锻炼和经验，生产是热烈的搞起来了。\n    就以边府为例：在搬来邯郸以前，杨主席就向全体干部作了艰苦生产的动员。杨、戎主席同样有生产任务，他们和干部与杂务人员变工，并缴出全部稿费。一些总务人员事先到邯郸作准备。在没有找到土地之前，大家有计划的先给人家包工，找到土地之后，马上抓紧农时进行农业生产。他们建立了生产委员会，严密的分了工，有的专门接洽包工，有的负责准备农具种籽。委员会下的生产小组直接领导生产人员，大家都是有了生产锻炼且得到过生产利益的，经过首长的号召与组织领导，立刻就行动起来了。"

After two weeks of deliberation, all students in the school had a relatively clear understanding. First, model students in learning were elected, with Zhao Qingquan, Jia Xueqian, and Jiang Risheng being selected. Zhao Qingquan's main achievement was that he initiated the organization of a \"reading group.\" A group of people often followed him, studying books and newspapers or discussing current affairs. Eventually, the reading group expanded to more than eighty people, forming a school-wide reading movement. Next, model students in production were elected, with Guo Yunshan, Jia Xueqian, and Guo Changxing being selected. Guo Yunshan's characteristic is his particular enthusiasm for production. Once, he was hit in the head by a well winch while watering, but he went to work the next day. He is often able to unite many students to work. Jia Xueqian can help students in both learning and production and has a strong spirit of friendship. Students are willing to be close to him.

    "content": "[Our Yangcheng Dispatch] The Taiyue Region's Changzi County, at its county and district cadre activist meeting last month, summarized the achievements of the county's four-month mass movement and pointed out the future direction of widespread and in-depth progress. At the beginning of March, the county successively transitioned to the rent reduction and interest rate reduction movement and the increase capital movement. Except for twenty-nine natural villages in the county that had not yet carried out rent reduction, all of the remaining four hundred and fifty natural villages carried out rent reduction. The masses conducted 4,598 rent reduction reasoning sessions, with the participation of 54,251 people. The masses recovered 12,760 mu and nine fen of land, 88,851 shi, six dou, and nine sheng of grain, 2,882 rooms, 21,705 silver yuan, 59,390 Ji banknotes, and 196 head of livestock. During the movement, the number of peasant association members increased to 25,317, and the number of militia increased to 4,684. In the struggle, 1,881 activists emerged. Due to the rapid development of the mass movement, rural class relations changed dramatically. According to a survey of eight villages: the number of well-to-do middle peasants increased from 34 households to 55 households, the number of middle peasants increased from 464 households to 915 households, the number of poor peasants decreased from 638 households to 389 households, and the number of extremely poor decreased from 189 households to 7 households. The masses' enthusiasm for production after recovering their own interests has been unprecedentedly high. Currently, 1,572 mutual aid groups have been established throughout the county, with the participation of 11,149 people, who are actively engaged in agricultural production. The county leadership has now pointed out to the entire county: The direction of future efforts is to make the movement more in-depth and balanced. During the busy farming season, cadres should participate in labor, produce alongside the peasants, and struggle together, closely integrating production with rent reduction. And boldly use activists, trust the masses, to quickly implement rent reduction and promote the county's large-scale production movement.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\nPlaces:\n\n阳城  Yangcheng\n太岳区  Taiyue Qu (Taiyue Region)\n长子县  Changzi Xian (Changzi County)\n\nCurrency:\n\n银元  Yinyuan (Silver Yuan)\n冀钞  Ji Chao (Ji Banknotes - Currency used in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region)\n\nUnits:\n\n亩  Mu\n分  Fen\n石  Shi\n斗  Dou\n升  Sheng\n\nOrganizations:\n\n农会  Nonghui (Peasant Association)\n民兵  Minbing (Militia)\n\nEvents/Movements:\n\n群运  Qunyun (Mass Movement)\n减租减息  Jianzu Jianxi (Rent Reduction and Interest Rate Reduction)\n增资运动  Zengzi Yundong (Increase Capital Movement)\n大生产运动  Dashengchan Yundong (Large-Scale Production Movement)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 长子群运进行四月贫苦农民大部上升  生产情绪高涨万余人参加互助组\n\n1946-05-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　长子群运进行四月贫苦农民大部上升\n    生产情绪高涨万余人参加互助组\n    【本报阳城讯】太岳区长子县于上月县区干部积极分子会上，总结了全县四个月群运成绩，并指出今后普遍深入的方针。三月初，该县即先后转入减租减息与增资运动。全县除二十九个自然村尚未进行减租外，其余四百五十个自然村全部进行了减租，群众进行减租说理四千五百九十八次，参加群众五万四千二百五十一人，群众收回土地一万二千七百六十亩零九分，粮食八万八千八百五十一石六斗九升，房屋两千八百八十二间，银元两万一千七百零五元，冀钞五万九千三百九十元，牲口一百九十六头。运动中农会会员增到两万五千三百一十七人，民兵增至四千六百八十四人。在斗争中，涌现积极分子一千八百八十一人。由于群运迅速开展，农村阶级关系急剧变化，据八个村调查：富裕中农由卅四户增加至五十五户，中农由四百六十四户增至九百一十五户，贫农由六百卅八户减至三百八十九户，赤贫由一百八十九户减至七户。群众收回自己利益后的生产情绪，空前提高，现全县已成立起一千五百七十二个互助组，参加群众一万一千一百四十九人，正积极进行农业生产。现该县领导上，已向全县指出：今后努力的方向是使运动更加深入和平衡。在农忙季节中，干部应参加劳动，和农民一齐生产，一齐斗争，把生产与减租密切结合起来进行。并大胆使用积极分子，相信群众，以迅速贯彻减租，推进全县大生产运动。"

The economic construction part, in terms of agriculture: In order to increase grain production, it is necessary to cultivate and hoe more, apply manure and accumulate fertilizer, prevent and control diseases and pests, promote improved varieties, and resettle immigrants for land reclamation, aiming to ensure that every household is well-fed and clothed and has surplus grain each year within three years. In order to increase cotton production, it is necessary to increase the yield to an average of ten jin of cotton per mu, and the area planted with cotton should be maintained at 350,000 mu, striving to reach 400,000 mu within three years. In order to develop agricultural crops with higher economic value, the Border Region will promote the planting of oil crops, sugar beets, white ramie, and alfalfa. To increase farmers' income, it is also necessary to develop mountain products and promote sideline occupations, such as collecting medicinal materials, raising silkworms, and beekeeping. In addition, it is necessary to build water conservancy projects, improve soil quality, plant trees and protect forests, develop fruit trees, breed livestock, and prevent and treat diseases. The plan believes that to promote the development of various agricultural, animal husbandry, and forestry undertakings, it is necessary to continue to promote various labor mutual aid organizations in various places, gradually improve their role, formulate farmer household plans, reform idlers, settle refugees, absorb women into production, and continue to carry out the labor model movement. In terms of industry: Publicly-owned industries will develop petroleum, wool spinning groups, leather making, matches, soap, etc., and a machine repair and manufacturing company is planned to be established this year. Folk handicrafts and household sideline occupations, such as the already partially developed textiles, felt, wool bags, pile carpets, leather tanning, papermaking, oil pressing, silk weaving, straw hats, and porcelain, still need to be promoted and developed, such as the manufacture of tobacco from dried tobacco leaves, the extraction of soybean oil, the casting of iron tools, the refining of sugar and honey, etc. The democratic government will systematically assist the development of these folk handicrafts. In terms of cooperative undertakings: In the future, it will be practical to face the countryside, focusing on production, and combine with various rural household sideline occupations. The existing cooperatives will be thoroughly rectified and re-registered this year. In terms of trade: The tasks in the future are to expand the management of native products, support industrial development, regulate domestic and foreign markets, support cooperative undertakings, and support finance. In terms of finance: In the future, in order to enable it to cooperate with and assist the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce, it is necessary to strive to stabilize finance, develop the economy, and support finance.\n    Cultural and educational construction part: Regarding university education, the task of Yan'an University is to cultivate local higher-level intellectuals and improve the culture of existing middle-level cadres in the Border Region. Regarding secondary education, the various secondary schools in the Border Region should systematically cultivate middle-level intellectuals in the Border Region and improve the culture of existing district and township cadres in the Border Region. Regarding national education, the education of primary schools and public primary schools should improve their quality by improving teachers, providing textbooks on time, and overcoming the phenomenon of student mobility. Regarding national health, it is necessary to mobilize all the people in the Border Region to fight against disease and death, widely carry out health publicity and education to prevent diseases and epidemics, and strengthen the medical equipment and treatment work in the entire Border Region as much as possible. Regarding mass literature and art, various forms that the masses love to see and hear will be used to gradually improve the cultural life of the people in the Border Region, and strengthen the Border Region Literary Association and local theatrical troupes. Regarding mass newspapers and publishing and distribution, it is necessary to strengthen local newspapers, pay attention to cultivating local news work cadres, and strengthen the Border Region Bookstore and the Border Region Publishing Agency.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n陕甘宁边区  Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region\n延安  Yan'an\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n延安大学  Yan'an University\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陕甘宁边区政府颁布“三年建设计划方案”   加强经济文教建设，做到家家丰衣足食，提高干部、群众文化。\n\n1946-05-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　陕甘宁边区政府颁布“三年建设计划方案” \n    加强经济文教建设，做到家家丰衣足食，提高干部、群众文化。\n    【新华社延安廿六日电】陕甘宁边区一九四六年至一九四八年建设计划方案，业经边区三届参议会第一次大会通过，日前边区政府特予公布，并令各级政府各部队各机关学校确实实行。该计划分为经济建设与文教建设两大部份；其经济建设部份在农业方面：为了增产粮食，要多耕多锄，施粪积肥，防治病害虫，推广良种，并移民垦植，期于三年内达到家家丰衣足食，年有余粮。为了增产棉花，要提高产量至每亩平均收花十斤，植棉亩数基本上维持三十五万亩，争取三年内达到四十万亩。边区为发展经济价值较高之农作物，今后将推广种植油类作物糖萝卜白麻和苜蓿。为增加农民收入，还应开发山货，提倡副业，如采集药材、养蚕、养蜂等。此外还要兴修水利，改良土质，植树护林，发展果木，繁殖牲畜，防疫治病。该计划认为要推进各种农牧林事业的发展，必须在各地继续推广各种劳动互助组织，并逐渐提高其作用，制订农户计划，改造二流子，按置移难民，吸收妇女参加生产，并继续开展劳模运动。在工业方面：公营工业将发展石油、毛纺组、制革、火柴、肥皂等，本年内并拟设机器修理制造公司。民间手工业及家庭副业，如已有部份发展的纺织、毛毡、毛袋、栽绒毡、硝皮、制革、造纸、榨油、丝织、草帽、瓷器等。尚待提倡和发展的如旱烟叶制烟、榨豆油、铸制铁用具、精炼糖提蜂蜜等，民主政府对这些民间手工业，将有计划的协助其发展。在合作事业方面：今后将切实面向农村，以生产为主，并与农村各种家庭副业相结合，对现有合作社，今年内将切实整顿，从新登记。在贸易方面：今后任务为扩大土产经营，扶助工业发展，调剂内外市场，扶助合作事业，与支持财政等。在金融方面：今后为使其能配合与协助农工商业之发展，必须努力做到稳定金融，发展经济，扶持财政。\n    文教建设部分：关于大学教育，延安大学之任务，为培养本地较高级的知识分子，与提高边区中级的现任干部。关于中等教育，边区各中等学校，应有计划的培养边区中级知识分子，与提高边区现任区乡干部的文化。关于国民教育，各完小及公立普小的教育，应从提高师资，按时供给课本，及克服学生流动现象等方面来提高其质量。关于国民卫生，要动员全边区人民，同疾病死亡作斗争，广泛进行预防疾病瘟疫的卫生宣传教育，尽可能的加强全边区的医药设备与治疗工作。关于群众文艺，将利用群众所喜见乐闻的各种形式，逐渐提高边区人民的文化生活，并加强边区文协与各地方剧团，关于大众报纸及出版发行，为加强地方报纸，注意培养本地新闻工作干部，加强边区书店与边区出版机关。"

Two thousand organized workers in Nagoya recently held a three-hour rally and demonstration, passing twenty-one resolutions, including demanding the immediate distribution and increase of delayed rice rations, demanding the dissolution of the prefectural assembly, and demanding the immediate resignation of the prefectural governor and the mayor of Nagoya. Japanese university students in Kyoto also held a mass rally, announcing their opposition to Yoshida, opposition to the government, and demanding the democratization of the education system and the stability of student life. Representatives from five student associations submitted a joint resolution to Prime Minister Yoshida, Minister of Education Tanaka Hidetarō, and various political parties, demanding the expulsion of war criminals from educational institutions. Student representatives should participate in the teacher qualification review committee. Seventy representatives from the Japan Teachers' Union in Tokyo went to the Ministry of Education for a sit-in strike to demand a salary increase.

Speaking of today's military, the living conditions of government soldiers are such that they wear clothes worse than Japanese prisoners and eat food inferior to foreigners' pet dogs. ... Now that victory has been achieved, not only do they not get the opportunity to retire and return home to see their parents, wives, and children again, but they are also driven to the white mountains and black waters, forcing compatriots who survived the disaster to kill each other, which they are absolutely unwilling to do.

According to the Shanghai Wenhui Daily, recently, the import of American cotton has been increasing daily (in Tianjin alone, from January to March, the total value of American cotton imports reached over 200 million yuan).

    "content": "Production Campaign in Yuebei District\n    Xinhua News Agency Taiyue Branch Communication\n    The production campaign in Yuebei this year, like other places, is primarily faced with the difficulty of a shortage of labor and livestock. After eight years of devastation by the enemy and puppets, and the slaughter and conscription by Yan's army, Yuebei's labor and livestock have greatly decreased. According to a survey of Qinyuan, Anze, Qin County, and Tunliu counties, there are a total of 1,915,969 mu of land, with only 90,803 full laborers. Based on a standard of 18 mu of land cultivated per laborer, 366,814 mu of land will be left uncultivated due to lack of manpower. In terms of livestock, there are a total of 32,096 cattle, donkeys, mules, and horses, equivalent to 16,043 yokes. Based on 80 mu cultivated per yoke, there is still a shortage of 3,632 yokes, meaning that 289,884 mu of land cannot be cultivated due to lack of livestock. The shortage of livestock along the Tongpu Railway has always been severe, and the looting by stubborn troops has made the difficulties even greater than in Qin, An, and Tun counties. Secondly, the prevalence of epidemics and the increase in diseases have made the labor shortage even more acute. According to statistics from 18 natural villages in Tunliu (in March), 595 people suffered from nutritional deficiency. In Jiazhai Village, Anze, almost all children suffered from nutritional deficiency. Often, one person's illness requires the entire family to care for them, and some are not cured by doctors, causing extreme anxiety among the masses and reducing their enthusiasm for labor. In addition, Yan's army frequently attacks the liberated areas along the Baijin Railway, which greatly affects production in the border areas. In terms of the masses' ideology, due to insufficient ideological education in the mass movement, and the rumors and sabotage by special agents and landlords, some of the masses are ideologically confused and lack enthusiasm for production. Some even dare not boldly develop themselves, but take pride in being poor. A poor peasant in Jindui Village, Anze, bought a few mu of land, and people said when they saw him, \"You are having a good time again!\" He was startled. He often thought that if one family had a bad influence on him, it would be better to eat, drink, and be merry.\"\n    In order to overcome the above obstacles to the production campaign, the leading organs in Yuebei implemented the following methods to promote production: (1) Organize mutual aid production and mobilize a large number of semi-laborers to participate in production. Qinyuan has implemented this plan better. They specifically determined the organization of mutual aid in each village at 30% to 80% and the organization of women and children semi-laborers at 20% to 50% according to the work base and needs. According to the inspection of the third li of Beiyuan Village, 22 of the 35 male full laborers were organized, accounting for 88% of the total, and 7 of the 15 semi-laborer women were organized, accounting for 46% of the total. Eight of the 12 children were organized, accounting for 66% of the total. In Xiaozhang Village, semi-laborers are responsible for delivering manure and plowing. The mutual aid group of women Guo Jinying and Guo Wan'e relies entirely on them to do the work of ten families. In the villages along the Langwei River, one can see full and semi-laborers in various forms of mutual aid every day. In terms of livestock adjustment, more than 60 mule and horse fairs were held throughout the region to buy and sell livestock, which greatly alleviated the severity of the livestock shortage.\n    (2) Launch an epidemic prevention campaign. The special commissioner's office has issued an order to each county to hold doctor symposiums to study symptoms and sources of disease, exchange experience, and organize medical commando teams to treat the masses. Tunliu is a model for implementing this work. They organized doctors to promote epidemic prevention and various symptoms and treatments at various meetings (cadre meetings, mass meetings, labor hero meetings, etc.). Under the leadership and promotion of model doctor Gao Guang, dozens of medical commando teams were organized to provide home treatment. They also merged many pharmacies and resident doctors into medical cooperatives, extracting doctors and primary school teachers to compile teaching materials and songs about symptoms, sources of disease, and treatments, and used schools, night schools, and noon schools to carry out publicity. At the same time, it was stipulated that infants under the age of seven must be buried after death (local customs consider burial to be unlucky), abandoned bones on Laoyeshan were immediately buried, and sellers of medicines were prohibited from substituting fakes for genuine products or inferior products for superior ones; therefore, the disease has been reduced and deaths have decreased. Model doctor Li Kerang of Anze and doctor Hu Zhao of Qinyuan treated more than 30 children with nutritional deficiency within a month. All localities have achieved results and are continuing to fight the disease.\n    (3) Conduct extensive and in-depth policy education to clarify ideological confusion. The method to solve this problem is to first carry out education among cadres at all levels (especially village cadres). In Qinyuan, the question of \"Do we dare to get rich? What is the revolution for?\" was discussed in depth among cadres and the masses. In Qin County, Song Deyuan, a new-style rich peasant, was used as an example to mobilize people. In Anze, the \"New-style Rich Peasant Village\" in Lijia Gou, District 3, was used as educational material (the village has a total of seven households, all of whom were tenant farmers before the war. Now, all are rich peasants, and each family hires long-term workers (hired workers and shepherds). There are a total of nine, as well as seven cattle, two donkeys, seven mules, and 370 sheep. All laborers in the village are organized for mutual aid production). Cadres to the masses, activists to backward elements, from the basic masses to the upper-class members of society were all educated. Other counties are doing the same. Proverbs such as \"Exploiting money is like water, boats. Money earned by sweat and blood lasts ten thousand years.\" are used to stabilize the well-to-do households that have not been subjected to feudal exploitation. During the education, the general mood of the masses has gradually stabilized, which has powerfully promoted the production campaign.\n    In areas where production is the main focus, how to use breaking through one point to promote the overall situation, while also centralizing production work, is an important link for leadership at present. Yuebei's solution to this problem is as follows:\n    (1) Organizations at the special district and county levels establish production committees, with the government as the main body, and absorbing production and sales companies, banks, joint committees, and labor heroes to participate. Their main task is to study guidelines and plans, inspect work, and organize forces. Its main leadership content is mutual aid groups and cooperatives, unifying the organization and use of administrative, organizational, and economic forces to thoroughly implement the guidelines and plans.\n    (2) Each level of the special district, county, and district determines base points, allocates key personnel, gains experience, and promotes the overall situation. The special district, county, and district determine regular contact at each level to discover typical examples as the backbone and bridge to promote the overall situation. The implementation of this method is better in Qinyuan and Anze. Qinyuan selects base points based on typical examples and major problems that need to be solved in each region. They work with the special commissioner's office to use Beiyuan in District 1 as a base point, mainly to obtain experience in organizing semi-laborers and livestock to promote the villages on both sides of District 1 and the Second Qin Avenue. The county government combines with District 4 to use Dinghu in District 4 as a base point, mainly for the purpose of creating experience in combining agriculture and sideline production to promote Districts 3 and 4 (because the local sideline products are abundant). The county government combines with District 5 to use Chishi Bridge as a base point, mainly for the purpose of obtaining experience in mobilizing middle peasants to participate in mutual aid to promote District 6 and parts of Districts 5 and 7 (because 80% of the area is middle peasants). In addition to this, each district has base points to gain experience in promoting local work. At present, various meetings (symposiums, cadre meetings, etc.) or briefings and visits are being used to promote the base point experience and other typical examples to the overall situation.\n    (3) Organizational work. Organize forces to ensure the thorough implementation of this method. The special commissioner's office first extracted 15 cadres from various departments and distributed them to various counties to participate in labor hero symposiums to understand problems, summarize typical examples, and help formulate guidelines and plans. Based on the problems reported after returning to the office, 15 more cadres were extracted and distributed to various counties to help solve problems and promote work (the Tongpu District focuses on water conservancy and takes Pingyao as the key point. The Baijin District focuses on combining mass movement and production and takes Tunliu as the key point. The Qin'an District focuses on production and takes Qinyuan as the key point). Each department (except the Construction Section) promoted departmental work by doing central work, and each county implemented this spirit. According to the materials already obtained, Qinyuan has thoroughly implemented this spirit. In addition to retaining more than ten cadres to persist in office work and agricultural production, it extracted 19 cadres to go deep into the base points to help inspect and stipulate that they report back to the county every half month, summarize problems, study work, and exchange experience. This leadership method is also specifically implemented in the village. For example, in Beiyuan Village, the cadres responsible for the regime, the joint committee, and the armed committee jointly organized a production committee, and all other cadres were organized to participate in mutual aid groups, leading by households and doors, so that each cadre had a clear position and specific tasks, and each cadre vowed to achieve three satisfactions: that is, the work is good and the superior is satisfied, the style is good and the masses are satisfied, and the production is good and the family is satisfied. Therefore, the work speed is very fast, and the cadres also feel relaxed and happy. According to the above situation, the current organization of male and female full and semi-laborers to implement the production campaign is still continuing.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n岳北区  Yuebei District\n新华社太岳分社  Xinhua News Agency Taiyue Branch\n沁源  Qinyuan\n安泽  Anze\n沁县  Qin County\n屯留  Tunliu\n同蒲  Tongpu\n白晋  Baijin\n金堆村  Jindui Village\n北园村  Beiyuan Village\n狼尾河  Langwei River\n郭金英  Guo Jinying\n郭万娥  Guo Wan'e\n高光  Gao Guang\n李克让  Li Kerang\n胡照  Hu Zhao\n三区李家沟  Lijia Gou, District 3\n宋德元  Song Deyuan\n赤石桥  Chishi Bridge\n平遥  Pingyao\n老爷山  Laoyeshan\n联委会  Joint Committee\n武委会  Armed Committee\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 岳北区的生产运动  新华社太岳分社通讯\n\n1946-05-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　岳北区的生产运动\n    新华社太岳分社通讯\n    岳北今年的生产运动，和其他各地一样，首先摆在运动面前的是劳畜力缺乏的困难。岳北经过八年敌伪的摧残以及阎军的屠杀抓丁后，人畜力大减，据沁源、安泽、沁县、屯留四县调查，共有土地一百九十一万五千九百六十九亩，全劳力只有九万零八百零三个，每个劳力以耕地十八亩为标准，则三十六万六千八百一十四亩地将因无人力而致荒芜。在畜力上共有牲畜牛、驴、骡、马三万二千零九十六头，合一万六千零四十三犋，每犋以耕八十亩计，尚缺乏牲畜三千六百三十二犋，即是说尚有二十八万九千八百八十四亩地无畜力耕种。同蒲沿线畜力向来缺乏，加之顽军抢劫其困难更甚于沁、安、屯诸县。其次瘟疫流行，病害激增，致劳力更感缺少，据屯留十八个自然村的统计（三月间），患糠症者五百九十五人，安泽贾寨村几乎所有小孩害糠症。常因一人有病全家看守，有些竟延医不治，使群众情绪极为不安，劳动劲头也就不大，加以阎军经常向白晋沿线解放区进攻，更大大影响边沿区的生产。在群众思想上由于群众运动中思想教育不够，及特务地主造谣破坏，一部分群众思想混乱，生产情绪不高，有的甚至存在不敢大胆发展自己，反以贫为荣。安泽金堆村某贫农买了几亩地，人们见了说：“你又好过啦！”他便吃惊。常想一人家对他影响不好，还不如大吃大喝了好些”。\n    为克服以上生产运动上的障碍，岳北领导机关便实行了下列几种推进生产的办法：（一）组织互助生产，并大量动员组织半劳力参加生产。沁源执行这一计划较好，他们按工作基础和需要具体的确定了各村组织互助百分之三十至八十，妇女儿童半劳力组织百分之二十至五十，据北园村第三闾检查，男全劳力三十五个组织起二十二人，占全数的百分之八十八，半劳力妇女十五人，组织起来的七人，占全数的百分之四十六。儿童十二人，组织起来的八人，占全数的百分之六十六。小章村送粪打茬都由半劳力去做。妇女郭金英，郭万娥互助组，十人家中的活全靠他们作。狼尾河沿岸各村，每天都可看到全半劳力各种互助在一起劳动。在畜力调剂上，全区举行了六十个以上的骡马大会买卖牲畜，这样大大减轻了畜力缺乏的严重性。\n    （二）开展防疫运动，专署已通令各县举行医生座谈会，研究病状病源交流经验，组织医疗突击队为群众治病。屯留是执行这一工作的模范，他们组织医生在各种会上（干部、群众、劳动英雄等会）宣传防疫和各种病状，治法，在模范医生高光领导推动下，组织了几十个医疗突击队登门疗病，并把许多药铺和坐柜医生合并，医药合作社，以抽出医生小学教员把病状病源和治方编成教材和歌曲，利用学校、夜校、午校进行宣传。同时又规定七岁以下的婴儿死后必须埋（乡俗认为埋后不吉），立即掩埋老爷山遗弃骨骸，并禁止各卖药者以假代真以劣顶优；因之病势见减，死亡减少。安泽模范医生李克让和沁源医生胡照一月内治小孩糠症三十余个。各地均有成绩，目前仍继续和病魔作斗争。\n    （三）广泛深入的进行政策教育，澄清思想上的混乱。解决这一问题的方法，首先从各级干部（尤其是村干部）中进行教育，在沁源把“我们敢不敢发财，革命为了什么”？在干部中群众中进行了深入的讨论。在沁县以新式富农宋德元为范例进行动员，安泽以三区李家沟“新式富农庄”为教育材料（该庄共七户，战前皆佃农，刻下均为富农，家家皆雇长工，（雇工和牧工）共有九个，还有七头牛，二条驴，七头骡，三百七十只羊，全庄所有劳力都组织互助生产），由干部到群众，由积极份子到落后分子，从基本群众到社会的上层分子中全都进行了宣传教育，其他各县都在这样做。又利用俗语如“剥削钱、水、船。血汗钱，万万年。”来安定未受封建剥削的小康户。教育中一般群众情绪都逐渐安定，有力的推动了生产运动。\n    在以生产为主的地区，怎样运用突破一点推动全面，而又使生产工作中心化，是领导上当前一个重要的环节。岳北对这个问题的解决办法是这样的：\n    （一）专县各级组织生产委员会，以政府为主并吸收产销公司、银行、联委会、劳英参加，其主要任务是研究方针计划，检查工作，组织力量。其主要领导内容是互助组，合作社，把行政力量组织力量经济力量统一组织使用，以彻底贯彻方针计划之实施。\n    （二）专、县、区各级均确定基点，重心配备，取得经验推动全面。专、县、区确定各级经常联系，以发掘典型为推动全面之骨干和桥梁。这一方法的执行，以沁源、安泽较好，沁源以各地区典型和需要解决的重大问题选择基点，他们和专署结合起来，以一区之北园为基点，主要是取得组织半劳力和畜力经验，推动一区及二沁大道两岸各村。县府和四区结合起来以四区定湖为基点，主要目的为创造农业和副业结合的经验，推动三、四区（因该地副产富），县府和五区结合起来，以赤石桥为基点，主要目的为取得动员中农参加互助经验，以推动六区及五、七区部分村庄（因该地百分之八十为中农）。除此以外，各区均有基点，取得推动地方性的工作经验。目前正利用各种会议（座谈会、干部会等）或通报，参观等方式，把基点经验和其它地区典型向全面推广。\n    （三）组织工作。组织力量保证这一方法彻底贯彻，专署第一次从各部门抽出十五个干部，分发各县参加劳英座谈会，了解问题，总结典型，帮助制订方针计划，依据回署后汇报的问题，第二次又抽出十五个干部，分发各县帮助解决问题推进工作（同蒲区以水利为主，以平遥为重点。白晋区以群众运动和生产结合为主，以屯留为重点。沁安区以生产为主，以沁源为重点），各部（除建设科外）通过作中心工作，推动部门工作，各县都贯彻这一精神。据已得的材料，以沁源执行这一精神为彻底，它除留十余干部坚持机关工作和农业生产外，抽出十九个干部深入基点帮助检查，规定半月回县汇报一次，总结问题，研究工作，交流经验。他们这一种领导方法也具体的贯彻在村，如北园村由政权、联委会、武委会各负责干部共同组织生产委员会，连同其它干部统统组织起来，大家参加互助组，分门分户领导，作到每个干部岗位明确任务具体，每个干部誓要做到三满意：即工作好上级满意，作风好群众满意，生产好家庭满意，因之工作速度很快，干部又觉得轻松愉快，根据以上的情况，目前仍在继续的组织男女全半劳力贯彻生产运动。"

    "content": "【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 28th】Rome Dispatch: The Italian elections will be held on June 2nd. This is the first general election for the Italian people since 1922. At that time, the Italian people (including women, who are also getting the right to vote for the first time) will vote to elect 540 members of the Constituent Assembly and will express their attitude towards the monarchy. Due to the widespread democratic movement in Italy after the fall of the fascist regime, especially the large scale of the people's democratic movement in northern Italy, unlike other countries in Europe (such as Greece), the Italian reactionaries did not demand immediate elections, but used all means to delay the elections. The remnants of fascism mainly appear as royalists. They are supported more or less by the \"Liberal Party\" (the traditional party of big landlords and industrialists) within the government and the advisory council, as well as the Christian Democratic Party, and the Labour Democratic Party, and are supported by fascist financiers who fled to Switzerland, and by fascist military officers and senior bureaucrats in the country who have not yet been purged, and by big landlords in southern Italy. The Polish exiled General Anders' troops (currently stationed on the Adriatic coast), who are nurtured by Britain, and even some measures taken by the British and American military government, have also become the backing for the royalists to carry out anti-people activities. After their attempt to delay the elections failed, they adopted the despicable means of assassinating candidates from various democratic parties. However, such reactionary activities cannot stop the Italian people's desire for democracy. At present, no place in Italy has returned to a normal peacetime state. The situation of food, fuel and transportation is very serious. The number of unemployed workers reached two million in February of this year, and is still increasing. The people are eager to end this situation. Relying on their own experience, the Italian people place their hopes on the Italian Communist Party. In January of this year, the Italian Communist Party had 1.8 million members (including about 300,000 women and about 400,000 young people under the age of 25). In a certain province, 15 percent of the residents participated in the Communist Party. With the trust of the people, the Italian Communist Party is not only confident in the election, but also deeply believes that under the conditions of the unanimous approval of the Republic by the people of the whole country, resolutely breaking with the reactionaries, eliminating fascism, and maintaining unity with all democratic forces, the Italian Communist Party can satisfy the people's desires, restore national independence, guarantee labor welfare, unite the people, and realize a thorough democratization program. In the local elections (held in March), the Socialist Party, which closely cooperated with the Italian Communist Party, has no major differences in its program with the Communist Party. Their joint actions will continue before and after the election. The Italian people are deeply convinced that the consistency and joint action of the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party will bring a new scene to the upcoming general election.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n意大利    Italy\n罗马    Rome\n新华社    Xinhua News Agency\n延安    Yan'an\n六月二日  June 2nd\n立宪会议   Constituent Assembly\n自由党   Liberal Party\n基督教民主党  Christian Democratic Party\n劳工民主党   Labour Democratic Party\n瑞士    Switzerland\n亚得里亚海滨   Adriatic Coast\n安德斯  Anders\n英国    Britain\n希腊    Greece\n意大利共产党  Italian Communist Party\n社会党   Socialist Party\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 意大选行将举行  意共对选举深具信心能够满足人民的欲望\n\n1946-05-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　意大选行将举行\n    意共对选举深具信心能够满足人民的欲望\n    【新华社延安二十八日电】罗马讯：意大利大选，将于六月二日举行，这是一九二二年以来意国人民的第一次大选，届时意大利人民（包括妇女，她们也第一次得到选举权），将投票选举立宪会议的五百四十名议员，并将表示他们对君主制度的态度。由于意大利在法西斯政权倒台后的普遍的民主运动高潮，尤其是意大利北部人民民主运动的巨大规模，与在欧洲其他国家（例如希腊）不同，意反动派不是要求立即选举，而是用一切方法迟延选举。法西斯残余主要以保皇党面孔出现，他们得到政府及咨询议会内部的“自由党”（传统的大地主与大工业家的政党）、及基督教民主党、与劳工民主党或多或少的支持，并得到逃往瑞士的法西斯财政家、及国内尚未被清洗的法西斯军官与大官僚、及意南部的大地主的支持，被英国豢养的波兰流亡将军安德斯的部队（现驻于亚得里亚海滨）以及甚至英美军政府的某些措施，也都成了保皇党进行反人民活动的靠山。他们进行迟延选举的企图失败后，就采取了暗杀各民主党候选人的卑劣手段，但是，这种反动活动，阻止不了意大利人民的民主欲求。目前意国内还没有一个地方的生活，已返回了正常的平时状态，粮食燃料与运输的情况，非常严重，失业工人在本年二月间，即达两百万，目前还在增加。人民急于要求结束这个状况，依靠自身的经验，意国人民把希望寄托在意大利共产党身上。今年一月间，意共即有一百八十万党员（其中妇女约三十万，二十五岁以下的青年约四十万），而在某个省内，居民的百分之十五都参加了共产党。在人民的信赖之下，意共不仅对选举抱有信心，而日深信在全国人民一致同意赞成共和国、坚决与反动派分裂、并萧清法西斯、及与一切民主力量保持团结等条件下，意共能够满足人民的欲望，恢复国家独立，保证劳工福利，团结人民，实现彻底民主化政纲。在地方选举（已于三月间举行）中，即与意共密切合作的社会党，在纲领上与共产党并无重要分歧，他们的联合行动，在选举之前与以后，均将继续下去。意国人民深信意共与社会党的一致与联合行动，将给行将到来的大选带来新的景象。"

The distribution outside the city was the responsibility of the Liberated Area Relief Committee, with UNRRA and CNRRA representatives participating. Refugees who escaped from Yongnian city, except for a portion who moved to distant places for employment, were scattered in 181 villages in Yongnian, Handan, and other places. 6,422 people who were registered and verified have received grain. The distribution inside the city was the responsibility of UNRRA and CNRRA representatives, with representatives from the Liberated Area Relief Committee participating. The puppet troops entrenched in the city repeatedly falsely reported the number of refugees. The Liberated Area Relief Committee representative advocated submitting the refugee registration books inside and outside the city for review by the refugees inside and outside the city. In desperation, the puppet troops threatened to deny relief and refused to review. Our representative, considering the urgent need for relief among the refugees in the city, agreed to issue grain according to their falsely reported list of 6,498 people, and reluctantly tolerated the puppet troops' fraudulently obtained portion of the grain. On the 19th, when Li Xia, the representative of the Liberated Area, was conducting relief in the city, the puppet troops openly insulted him. The next day, when our representative was distributing grain in the streets, he exposed the puppet troops' conspiracy to defraud grain and their ugly behavior of insulting relief personnel to the masses.

According to figures released by Czech officials on the 27th, the Communist Party received a total of over 2,695,000 votes in the Constitutional Assembly elections, double that of the second-largest party, the National Socialist Party (to which President Beneš originally belonged). The results for each province are as follows: In the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia (Czech), the Communist Party is in the lead, with 2,205,658 votes; the National Socialist Party, 1,198,967 votes; the Catholic People's Party, 1,100,920 votes; and the Social Democratic Party, 855,779 votes. In Slovakia, the Communist Party is second, with 490,257 votes; the Catholic Democratic Party, 989,275 votes (Note: the above six parties are parties of the National Front); the Liberal Party, 67,575 votes; and the Labor Party, 49,993 votes. The total number of blank votes does not exceed one percent. British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt told a United Press reporter in London that \"the significance of the Czech Communist Party's victory in this election will greatly influence the parliamentary elections in Italy and France, which are to be held on June 2nd.\" He also said that the Czech election results prove that \"the progressive and democratic socio-economic reform policies pursued by the Czech National Front since the liberation of Czechoslovakia have been successful.\"\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n捷克  Jié kè (Czech Republic)\n捷克共产党   Jié kè gòngchǎn dǎng (Czech Communist Party)\n英国共产党   Yīngguó gòngchǎn dǎng (British Communist Party)\n波立特   Bō lì tè (Pollitt)\n布拉格   Bùlāgé (Prague)\n新华社   Xīnhuá shè (Xinhua News Agency)\n延安  Yán'ān\n立宪议会   Lìxiàn yìhuì (Constitutional Assembly)\n国家社会党   Guójiā shèhuì dǎng (National Socialist Party)\n贝奈斯   Bèi nài sī (Beneš)\n波希米亚   Bō xī mǐ yà (Bohemia)\n摩拉维亚   Mó lā wéi yà (Moravia)\n捷克族   Jié kè zú (Czech)\n天主教人民党   Tiānzhǔjiào rénmín dǎng (Catholic People's Party)\n社会民主党   Shèhuì mínzhǔ dǎng (Social Democratic Party)\n斯洛伐克   Sīluòfákè (Slovakia)\n天主教民主党   Tiānzhǔjiào mínzhǔ dǎng (Catholic Democratic Party)\n民族阵线   Mínzú zhènxiàn (National Front)\n自由党   Zìyóu dǎng (Liberal Party)\n工党   Gōngdǎng (Labor Party)\n伦敦   Lúndūn (London)\n合众社   Hézhòng shè (United Press)\n意大利  Yìdàlì (Italy)\n法国  Fàguó (France)\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 捷克大选胜利结束  捷共荣膺首席大党  英共总书记波立特盛赞捷共胜利  意义重大将影响于意法国会选举\n\n1946-05-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　捷克大选胜利结束\n    捷共荣膺首席大党\n    英共总书记波立特盛赞捷共胜利  意义重大将影响于意法国会选举\n    【新华社延安二十八日电】布拉格讯：捷克大选已胜利结束，捷克共产党已荣膺该国首席大党。据二十七日捷克官方发表的数字，共产党在立宪议会选举中所获之总票数共计二百六十九万五千余票，双倍于第二大党国家社会党（贝奈斯总统原属该党），各省结果如下：在波希米亚及摩拉维亚两省（捷克族），共产党居首席，得二百二十万五千六百五十八票，国家社会党一百十九万八千九百六十七票，天主教人民党一百一十万零九百二十票，社会民主党八十五万五千七百七十九票。在斯洛伐克共产党居第二位，占四十九万零二百五十七票，天主教民主党九十八万九千二百七十五票（按以上六党为民族阵线政党），自由党六万七千五百七十五票，工党四万九千九百九十三票。空白票总数，不超过百分之一。英共总书记波立特告伦敦合众社记者称：“此次捷克共产党选举胜利的意义，将大大影响于六月二日即要举行的意大利与法国的国会选举。”又称：捷克选举结果，证明“捷克民族阵线自捷克解放以来所奉行的进步与民主的社会经济改革政策，已获成功。”"

This is another concrete manifestation of their attempt to overthrow the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) agreements. The reactionaries feel that partially overturning the achievements of the PCC agreements politically is not enough, and therefore they are further attempting to use military force to provoke a civil war, thereby comprehensively overturning the PCC agreements. Therefore, they are seizing the Northeast issue, desperately attempting to place the Northeast outside the ceasefire zone, in order to fulfill their conspiracy to re-ignite a nationwide civil war.\" It then points out: \"If the reactionaries' conspiracy to expand the conflict in the Northeast cannot be stopped immediately, what will follow will be a nationwide civil war filled with the din of gunfire. The situation of peace and democracy will suffer a terrible destruction.\" The magazine stated: \"We call on the people of the whole country to raise their vigilance and prepare to immediately use action to stop the reactionaries' conspiracy.\" At the same time, it also hopes that the Kuomintang authorities will take into consideration the wishes of the people of the Northeast and use negotiations to resolve the political issues that exist in the Northeast.\"\n\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n昆明民主周刊   Kunming Democratic Weekly\n东北   Northeast\n国民党反动派  Kuomintang reactionaries\n新华社  Xinhua News Agency\n延安  Yan'an\n国共  Kuomintang and Communist Party\n政治协商会议  Political Consultative Conference (PCC)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 昆明民主周刊时评  呼吁制止东北内战  抨击国民党反动派违反协议\n\n1946-05-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　昆明民主周刊时评\n    呼吁制止东北内战\n    抨击国民党反动派违反协议\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】昆明民主周刊三卷六期刊载时评“立即制止东北内战”文称：“国民党的反动分子违反国共双方协议，以大军源源开入东北，引起冲突，拖延东北问题的政治解决，是其推翻政协会协议的又一具体表现。反动派觉得在政治上部分推翻政协协议的成果还不够，因此更企图进一步用军事力量挑起内战，进而全面推翻政协协议。因此抓紧东北问题，极力企图将东北划在停战圈外，以便逞其重新挑动全国性内战的阴谋”。接着指出：“反动派在东北扩大冲突的阴谋，如果不能即时制止，接着来的，将是一个炮火喧天的全国性内战。和平民主局面，将遭到可怕的毁灭”。该杂志称：“我们呼吁全国人民提高警觉，准备即时用行动去制止反动派的阴谋”。同时并希望国民党当局，顾全东北人民的愿望，用谈判方式，解决东北所存在的政治问题”。"

The letter stated: \"The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region includes 174 counties across four provinces, with a population of 30 million. The Border Region administration is unified. However, your organization's relief work is divided into provincial offices, which causes inconvenience. For example, the 18 counties in central Shanxi, with Yan Xishan's county government as the center for implementing relief, face difficulties in caring for the vast rural areas under our jurisdiction in those counties. Furthermore, the distribution and transportation of relief supplies to our Border Region require separate consultations with the Qingdao, Tianjin, Taiyuan, and Kaifeng offices, with separate routes of transport. Given the current administrative organization and inconvenient transportation conditions, this inevitably causes difficulties for both sides and is not economically efficient in terms of time. Therefore, we hope that your organization can transport all materials for relieving the people in our Border Region from Shanghai via Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Xinxiang, and Anyang to Shuiye Town, and then we will connect to Handan to jointly distribute them with personnel dispatched by your organization. This is more convenient. If agreed, and implemented, the organization and responsibility for relief work should be determined separately to change the current multi-party responsibility system.

    "content": "Yongnian Puppet Troops Continue Provocations\n    U.S. Representative Confirms Deep Regret; We Again Demand Disbandment of Puppet Troops in the City\n    [This Newspaper Yongnian Twenty-seventh Dispatch] Since the U.S. and KMT representatives of the Yongnian group entered Yongnian city, the puppet troops in the city, under the instigation and protection of the KMT representative, have become increasingly rampant, actively engaging in provocations, and are urgently repairing airport works in the city, plotting to use Yongnian city as a base for coordinating a large-scale civil war. The U.S. and KMT representatives entered the city on the afternoon of the 15th. Starting at 9:00 AM the next morning, the puppet troops in the city launched a fierce shooting attack on the defensive positions of our troops outside the West Gate. Chen Fu, a platoon leader of the first squad of the first company of the first battalion of the third sub-district of Jinnan, was seriously wounded. After a personal investigation and examination by the three-party representatives, U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Olson confirmed that he was indeed injured by the puppet troops, while KMT Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Chaozheng made unreasonable sophistry and shirked responsibility for the puppet troops. At around 4:00 PM on the 24th, puppet troops even sneaked out of the city by boat and opened fire to harass, and an ordinary person, Dong Liangzi, was shot and died six hours later. Unexpectedly, at 10:00 PM that night, the puppet troops sent out sixty to seventy people, took a boat to attack Songdi Village, five miles east of the city, captured villagers Dong Xigui and others, and robbed two civilian rifles. For this reason, our representative, Special Envoy, requested the U.S. and KMT representatives to go out of the city together for investigation. However, KMT Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Chaozheng defended the puppet troops again, and even shamelessly claimed: \"No one was killed, it's all fabricated by the Communist side.\" However, knowing that he was in the wrong, he refused to go out of the city to examine the corpse. U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Olson personally examined the corpse on the 25th and 26th and went to Songdi Village for investigation. As a result, he expressed his deep regret for this unfortunate incident. Furthermore, on the fourth day (the 18th) after the KMT representative entered the city, the puppet troops ordered the demolition of houses on 18 streets including West Street (accounting for one-third of the entire city), mobilized 2,000 people every day to urgently repair the airport, and built pillboxes and fortifications in the four cities on a large scale. Our resident military representative, Political Commissar Tian Ye, solemnly stated to U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Olson: \"Since the Kuomintang representative entered the city, the puppet troops have carried out a series of provocative actions and are preparing for a civil war, which is obviously a planned conspiracy under the instruction of the Kuomintang representative. We request the group to forward this to the Executive Headquarters to order the disbandment of the puppet troops in Yongnian city, and the Kuomintang representative should immediately stop this dangerous behavior of the puppet troops, otherwise the Kuomintang representative will be responsible for the consequences.\"\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n永年\tYongnian\n冀南三分区\tJinnan Third Sub-district\n陈辅\tChen Fu\n奥尔森\tOlson\n张朝正\tZhang Chaozheng\n董良子\tDong Liangzi\n宋堤村\tSongdi Village\n董喜贵\tDong Xigui\n田野\tTian Ye\n国民党\tKuomintang\n西街\tWest Street\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 永年伪军继续挑衅  美方代表证实深表遗憾我再要求解散城内伪军\n\n1946-05-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　永年伪军继续挑衅\n    美方代表证实深表遗憾我再要求解散城内伪军\n    【本报永年二十七日电】自永年小组国美两方代表进入永年城后，城内伪军在国方代表指使庇护下，愈益猖狂，积极进行挑衅，并在城内赶修机场工事，阴谋将永年城作为策应大规模内战的基地。国美两方代表系于十五日下午入城，翌晨九时起城内伪军即向西关外我军防地猛烈射击，我冀南三分区一大队一中队一排排长陈辅当负重伤，经三方代表亲自调查检验后，美代表奥尔森中校已证实确系伪军打伤，而国方代表张朝正中校则为伪军无理狡辩，推诿责任。二十四日下午四时许，竟又有伪军乘船窜出城外，开枪骚扰，老百姓董良子当被击中，六小时后即行殒命，讵当夜十时，伪又派出六七十人，乘船向城东五里之宋堤村进攻，捕去村民董喜贵等四人，劫去民枪两枝。为此我方代表特派员请国美两方代表出城共同调查，乃国方代表张朝正中校又为伪军抵赖，竟＠然声称：“并未打死人，全属共方捏造。”然自知理屈，又拒绝出城验尸，美代表奥尔森中校于二十五、二十六两日先后亲自验尸，并往宋堤村调查，结果表示对于此次不幸事件，极表遗撼。又伪军于国方代表进城后第四日（十八日）即下令拆毁西街等十八条街道的民房（占全城三分之一），每日以两千人赶修机场，并在四城大事兴筑碉堡工事，我驻军代表田野政委当向美代表奥尔森中校郑重提出：“自国民党代表入城后，伪军又进行一连串的挑衅行为，并作策应内战准备，显系在国民党代表授意下之有计划的阴谋行动，我们要求小组转呈执行部下令解散永年城内伪军，国民党代表并应即刻制止伪军此种危险行为，否则其后果概由国民党代表负责。”"

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "[Our newspaper's Weixian dispatch] Yongzhi County is launching a large-scale anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement. Yao Lou Village first launched a struggle against the traitor Yu Fengzao. From his grandfather's generation, Yu Fengzao had been a ruling figure in the village. After the incident [Japanese invasion], he surrendered to the enemy and served as a staff officer in the puppet army of Sun Jingming, committing many evils that the masses deeply hated. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China [1943], he falsely accused Tian Fuyuan of stealing his grain, not only detaining him but also beating Tian's elderly mother to death, and fined him 120 yuan. When a friend came to the home of poor peasant Gao Jian, he insisted that Gao was connected to the \"Eighth Route Army\" and led the local militia to surround the house at night, throwing more than a dozen hand grenades inside. His younger brother, Yu Fengxi, as the village deputy and head of the self-defense corps, was even more abhorrent. He once threatened and raped Yu Longzhang's daughter with a gun. Both of Yu Longzhang's daughters died of anger within days. After our army liberated Yongzhi last October, Yu Fengxi fled to Luonan, leaving Yu Fengzao behind. Yu secretly threatened the masses while probing the situation. In the fourth month of the lunar calendar [May], about 700 people, including farmers, hired laborers, women, and children of Yao Lou, found a Type 38 rifle, four \"single fighters\" [likely refers to single-shot rifles], and two baskets of small hand grenades in Yu Fengzao's home. Filled with indignation, the masses handed Yu over to the government for detention. After Yu was detained, the people of Yao Lou welcomed a new world. Everyone in the village was very happy, even the small landlords saying, \"This has taken away a sickness from us.\" The number of peasant association members increased from 100 to 150. All the poor peasants and most of the middle peasants joined, there were more than 20 militiamen, and there were also 24 trade union members, totaling more than 190 people. The experience from Yao Lou's anti-traitor grievance-airing revealed a few points: (1) It proves that anti-traitor grievance-airing is the urgent demand of all levels of the masses in the newly liberated areas, because of the killings, exploitation, and rapes inflicted on the masses by traitors over eight years, which have accumulated year after year and become unbearable. As the masses of Yao Lou said, \"Since the Eighth Route Army entered Yongzhi, we have had the intention to struggle against Yu Fengzao.\" The rapid expansion of mass organizations in Yao Lou changed the isolated situation of hired laborers, poor peasants, and orphans. (2) It can be seen that the broad masses most hate the heinous traitors and the masterminds who controlled the puppet district and township governments. For example, Tian Defa, a poor peasant in Yao Lou, served as a puppet village chief for several years, but he was actually a puppet who listened entirely to Yu Fengzao's orders. Therefore, the masses tolerated him and only asked him to confess his mistakes in public. (3) We should be good at organizing joint struggles, because heinous traitors have committed many evils, affecting an entire township, district, or county. Therefore, organizing several joint struggles will better demonstrate the power of the masses.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n人物 People:\n\n于凤早\tYu Fengzao\n孙经明\tSun Jingming\n田福源\tTian Fuyuan\n高俭\tGao Jian\n于凤喜\tYu Fengxi\n于龙章\tYu Longzhang\n田得法\tTian Defa\n\n地点 Places:\n\n威县\tWeixian\n永智\tYongzhi\n姚楼村\tYao Lou Cun (Yao Lou Village)\n洛南\tLuonan\n\n组织 Organizations:\n\n八路军\tEighth Route Army\n农会\tPeasant Association\n工会\tTrade Union\n伪军\tPuppet Army\n自卫团\tSelf-Defense Corps\n\n事件 Events:\n\n反奸诉苦运动\tAnti-Traitor and Grievance-Airing Movement\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 永智开展反奸诉苦运动  抓住了广大群众的要求改变了贫雇佃孤立局面\n\n1946-05-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　永智开展反奸诉苦运动\n    抓住了广大群众的要求改变了贫雇佃孤立局面\n    【本报威县讯】永智全县正在展开大规模的反奸诉苦运动，姚楼村首先掀起了一个反汉奸于凤早的斗争，于凤早从他祖父起辈辈就是这村的统治人物，事变后投敌，在伪军孙经明部当参谋长，作恶多端，群众无不痛恨。民国三十二年，诬赖田福源偷他的粮食，不但把人扣起来，还把田的老母痛打致死，另外还罚了一百二十元。贫农高俭家来了一个朋友，他硬说高通“八路”，晚上便带领团丁将房包围，向屋内扔了十几个手榴弹。其弟于凤喜当本村村副兼自卫团长，更是可恶，曾举枪威胁，强奸于龙章之女，不几天，这两个闺女便气死了。去年十月我军解放永智后，于凤喜逃往洛南，留下于凤早，一面暗中威胁群众，一面打听动静，旧历四月份，姚楼的农民、雇工、妇女、儿童约七百余人，在于凤早的家里找出一枝三八式枪，四个单打一，两筐小手榴弹，群情激愤，便将于送交政府扣押。于被扣起后，姚楼的人民换了个新世界，全村人都十分喜欢，连小地主都说“这可给俺去了一块病。”农会会员由一百人扩大到一百五十人，全部贫农及大部中农都涌进来，民兵有二十多个，还有工会会员二十四人，共计一百九十多人。从姚楼反奸诉苦中，得到几点经验：（一）证明了反奸诉苦是目前新解放区各阶层群众的迫切要求，因八年受汉奸们加给群众的枪杀、压榨、奸淫，年年积累早就忍无可忍了。正如姚楼的群众说：“自八路军进永智后，我们就有斗争于凤早的心思。”姚楼群众组织的很快扩大，改变了以雇佃贫孤立的局面。（二）可以看出广大群众最痛恨的是罪大恶极的汉奸和掌握伪区乡政权的主谋份子。如姚楼贫农田得法，当了几年伪村长，实际是傀儡，凡事全听于凤早的命令。因此群众就宽容他，只叫他当众坦白认错。（三）应当善于组织联合斗争，因为罪大恶极的汉奸，他们作恶甚多，影响有达一乡、一区、一县者。所以组织几个联合斗争，就更能显示群众的威力。"

    "content": "【New China News Agency, Yan'an, 28th】Paris dispatch: On one hand, the people's democratic union; on the other, the reactionaries' increasing arrogance—these are the characteristics of the French election campaign. At the start of the election campaign, the three major French parties all publicly solicited election funds. As of May 23, the Communist Party had raised 6.3 million francs, the Socialist Party had raised 900,000 francs, and the Popular Republican Movement dared not announce its donation figures due to the small amount of funds. Because of this and other similar situations, the French reactionaries placed all their hopes on foreign interference and the right wing of the Socialist Party. \"Le Figaro\" published an article by American journalist Walter Lippmann, saying: \"If the Communist Party comes to power, Anglo-American military intervention will be inevitable.\" At the same time, Washington has been sending out messages daily, saying that Léon Blum, the right-wing leader of the French Socialist Party, has achieved significant results in his loan activities in the United States. It is said that Blum met with Truman on the 22nd, and on the 24th, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and Treasury Secretary Vinson were resolving the details of the Franco-American financial agreement, and a $1.2 billion loan to France will soon be signed. \"Paris-Soir\" said that the anti-communist article by Socialist Party General Secretary Mayer was written under Blum's direct influence. The newspaper said that Blum called him almost every day from Washington, giving him instructions on the main principles of his election propaganda. The organ of the fascist Republican Liberty Party, \"Le Temps,\" proposed to the Socialist Party that the latter, together with the Popular Republican Movement and others, form an anti-communist French Labour Party, and said that if successful, Blum could be elected as the head of a Labour Party government excluding the Communist Party. \"Combat\" revealed that another plan of the reactionaries was that if some members of the Socialist Party opposed the establishment of a \"Labour Party,\" then the founders of the party were prepared to expel these members.\n\n\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n\n人民日报\tRenmin Ribao\n法国\tFrance\n共产党\tCommunist Party\n社会党\tSocialist Party\n人民共和党\tPopular Republican Movement\n费加拉\tLe Figaro\n李普曼\tWalter Lippmann\n英美\tAnglo-American\n华盛顿\tWashington\n莱翁勃鲁姆\tLéon Blum\n杜鲁门\tTruman\n贝纳斯\tByrnes\n文森\tVinson\n循环报\tParis-Soir\n梅耶\tMayer\n时代报\tLe Temps\n共和自由党\tRepublican Liberty Party\n抵抗报\tCombat\n劳动党\tLabour Party\n新华社\tXinhua News Agency\n延安\tYan'an\n巴黎\tParis\n美国\tUnited States\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 法国竞选运动展开  三大政党公开募集选举基金 社会党右派乞灵华盛顿\n\n1946-05-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　法国竞选运动展开\n    三大政党公开募集选举基金\n    社会党右派乞灵华盛顿\n    【新华社延安二十八日电】巴黎讯：一方面人民的民主联合，另方面反动派的日益嚣张，——这就是法国竞选运动中的特点。竞选运动开始时，法国三大政党都公开要募集选举基金，迄五月二十三日止，共产党募得了六百三十万法郎，社会党募得了九十万法郎，人民共和党则因款项太少，不敢公布捐款数字。由于这种及其他类似的情况，法国反动派把一切希望，寄托在外国的干涉与社会党的右派身上。“费加拉”报刊载了美国记者李普曼一文说：“如果共产党上台，则英美军事干涉即无可避免。”同时华盛顿则连日发出消息说：法国社会党右派领袖莱翁勃鲁姆，在美国的借款活动，已获得重大成果。据称：二十二日勃鲁姆与杜鲁门会谈，二十四日美国务卿贝纳斯与财长文森，已在解决法美财政协定中的细节问题，十二亿美元的对法贷款即将签字。巴黎循环报说：社会党总书记梅耶的反共文章，即是在勃鲁姆直接影响下写成的。该报说勃鲁姆几乎每天从华盛顿打长途电话给他，指示他竞选宣传的主要原则。法西斯共和自由党机关报《时代报》则向社会党提出，要后者连同人民共和党等组成一个反共的法国劳动党，并说如果成功，则勃鲁姆即可当选为排除共产党在外的劳动党政府的首脑。《抵抗报》揭露说：反动派的另一计划，为如果社会党内有一部分人反对建立“劳动党”，那么，该党创办人准备将这一部分党员排斥出去。"

    "content": "American Figures Discuss the Chinese Political Situation\n    The United States Should Cooperate with the Soviet Union to Promote Domestic Peace in China\n    American Troops Continuously Increase Forces Along the Beining Railway\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th] According to the U.S. Information Service, Massachusetts, 25th: U.S. Representative Hugh De Lacy (a Democrat from Washington state who strongly opposed Hurley's corrupt policy towards China), Walton Butterworth, Director of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department, and Representative Walter Judd, a Republican, discussed the various problems facing China in the process of completing the \"unified and democratic China\" stipulated by the Moscow Conference during a broadcast on the National Radio Network on the evening of the 25th. When discussing the responsibility for the recent Chinese internal strife, De Lacy pointed out: \"Most of the fault lies with the central government\" because the Kuomintang side violated the agreements more often. De Lacy advocated that \"the United States should use its military strength and all its power and prestige to promote domestic peace in China, and should not favor any side during the civil war.\" When De Lacy mentioned the Manchurian issue, he emphasized: \"We should not forget that the people of Manchuria have been under the iron heel of the Japanese since 1931. They long for freedom, and they do not want to be conquered by foreigners again, even if their new conquerors are Chinese.\" De Lacy also called for U.S.-Soviet cooperation to solve the China problem. In his broadcast, Butterworth, in addition to discussing Truman's policy statement on China last year, claimed that the aid we give to China is directed at the central government, but on the other hand, he also declared: But in any case, it should not fuel the Chinese civil war. Butterworth also mentioned the Political Consultative Conference, saying: The Consultative Conference decided to organize a coalition government, formulate a democratic constitution, guarantee personal, freedom of speech, assembly, and publication, and recognize that all political parties have equal legal status. In addition, agreements were reached on elections and the promotion of local autonomy. The Political Consultative Conference was a comprehensive meeting in China and a major step towards democracy in China. He expressed regret over the resurgence of internal strife after the Consultative Conference and the failure to implement the agreements. Butterworth then revealed the views of American public opinion, saying: \"American public opinion is eager for China to produce a democratic coalition government, and unanimously agrees that we should cooperate with the Soviet Union to formulate a policy towards China and the entire Far East.\" In his broadcast, Judd made some words to protect the Kuomintang, but also claimed that \"we should be in a neutral position, not favoring any political party, and supporting General Marshall's arduous work, so that the United States, China, and international peace can benefit greatly.\" He also stated: \"Supporting the current government to complete unification by force contains the possibility of being unwelcome, that is, China will be divided into two opposing camps, and all constructive policies in the Far East will be seriously hampered.\"\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th] TASS Shanghai, 26th: The military reporter of the Millard’s Review reported: \"In May, various units of the U.S. Marine Corps were transferred to the Beining Railway area to protect this transportation route controlled by the Kuomintang. The U.S. garrison troops stationed between Tangshan and Kaiping have been increased by 500 people. On May 14, the U.S. garrison troops stationed in Tangshan City increased from the original 400 to 600.\" Not long ago, Major General Rockey, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in Tangshan, claimed: \"The basic mission of the U.S. military is to defend Tangshan Airport.\" The reporter said: \"Under the protection of the U.S. military, the Kuomintang army is continuing to advance in order to conduct a large-scale war in Manchuria.\" The reporter continued: Because the Kuomintang army has launched offensives in Manchuria and other parts of China, peace negotiations are at a critical juncture, and any form of American assistance to the Kuomintang at this time will only promote the Chinese civil war. While the United States has publicly acknowledged that it wants to prevent this civil war, it cannot deny the reality that American assistance to the Kuomintang army has strengthened the internal hostility in China. In order to fight against the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, the elite Kuomintang army trained and equipped by the United States is being transferred from various parts of China to Manchuria via Qinhuangdao by the United States. The U.S. Marine Corps is now stationed in Qinhuangdao. Kuomintang personnel trained by the United States are now driving American tanks and bombers, launching offensives and bombing in the main directions of the Northeast, causing tens of thousands of residents to be killed and injured by American bombs and making thousands of people homeless. The houses at a station south of Benxi Lake have been completely destroyed by Kuomintang shells.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\nPeople:\n\n赫尔利  He'erli (Hurley)\n范宣德  Fàn Xuāndé (Walton Butterworth)\n裘德  Qiú Dé (Walter Judd)\n杜鲁门  Dùlǔmén (Truman)\n马歇尔  Mǎxiē'ěr (Marshall)\n骆基  Luòjī (Rockey)\n\nPlaces:\n\n马萨诸赤州  Mǎsàzhūchì Zhōu (Massachusetts)\n华盛顿州  Huáshèngdùn Zhōu (Washington State)\n延安  Yán'ān\n上海  Shànghǎi\n唐山  Tángshān\n开平  Kāipíng\n秦皇岛  Qínhuángdǎo\n本溪湖  Běnxī Hú\n满洲  Mǎnzhōu\n中国  Zhōngguó\n东北  Dōngběi\n\nOrganizations:\n\n新华社  Xīnhuá Shè (Xinhua News Agency)\n美国新闻处  Měiguó Xīnwén Chù (U.S. Information Service)\n民主党  Mínzhǔdǎng (Democratic Party)\n共和党  Gònghédǎng (Republican Party)\n国务院  Guówùyuàn (State Department)\n远东司  Yuǎndōng Sī (Far Eastern Division)\n国民无线电台  Guómín Wúxiàndiàntái (National Radio Network)\n密勒士评论报  Mìlèsī Pínglùnbào (Millard’s Review)\n塔斯社  Tǎsī Shè (TASS)\n海军陆战队  Hǎijūn Lùzhànduì (Marine Corps)\n东北民主联军  Dōngběi Mínzhǔ Liánjūn (Northeast Democratic Allied Army)\n国民党  Guómíndǎng (Kuomintang)\n\nEvents:\n\n莫斯科会议  Mòsīkē Huìyì (Moscow Conference)\n政治协商会议  Zhèngzhì Xiéshāng Huìyì (Political Consultative Conference)\n\nOther:\n\n北宁路  Běiníng Lù (Beining Railway)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美人士论中国政局  美国应与苏联合作促成中国国内和平  北宁路一带美军不断增兵\n\n1946-05-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美人士论中国政局\n    美国应与苏联合作促成中国国内和平     \n    北宁路一带美军不断增兵\n    【新华社延安二十八日电】据美新闻处马萨诸赤州廿五日讯：美华盛顿州民主党众议员德拉西（曾极力反对赫尔利对华的腐败政策）、国务院远东司长范宣德及共和党众议员裘德，二十五日晚在国民无线电台广播中，论述中国在完成莫斯科会议所规定之“统一与民主中国”过程内所面临之各种问题。德拉西在谈到最近中国内争之责任时指出：“大部过失在于中央政府”，因国民党方面违反协议之处较多。德氏力主“美国应利用兵力及一切力量和声望，以促成中国国内之和平，而不应于内战期中偏袒任何一方”。德氏述及满洲问题时强调说：“吾人不应忘却，满洲人民自一九三一年以来，即处于日人铁蹄下，彼等渴望获得自由，彼等不愿再度为外人所征服，即使彼等之新征服者为华人，亦属如此”。德氏并要求美苏合作，解决中国问题。范宣德在广播中，除论述去年杜鲁门对华政策声明外，一面虽称吾人给予中国之援助以中央政府为对象，另一方面又宣称：但无论如何，不应助长中国内战，范氏并称其政治协商会议，他说：协商会议决定组织联合政府，制定民主宪法、保证人身、言论、集会、出版等自由，承认各政党均有同等之合法地位，外此并获致关于选举、促进地方自治之协议。政治协商会议为中国之全面性会议，实为中国走向民主之一大进展。对于协商会议后内争之重新抬头，与协议之未能实现，表示遗憾。范氏继透露美国舆论之意见称：“美国舆论亟望中国能产生一民主联合政府，并一致承认应与苏联合作，共订一对中国及整个远东之政策”。裘德在广播中，对国民党作了袒护之词，但也力称“吾人应以中立之地位，不袒护任何政党，而支持马歇尔将军之艰巨工作，俾使中美及国际和平均获巨利”。并称：“支持现政府以武力完成统一，含有不受人欢迎之可能，即中国将分成两个对立之阵营，而使远东一切建设性之政策受到严重之阻碍。”\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】塔斯社上海二十六日电，密勒士评论报军事访员报导：“五月份美海军陆战队各部队被调至北宁路一带，保护操纵在国民党手里的这条交通路，唐山开平间驻扎的美军卫戍军，已增加五百人。五月十四日，唐山市内驻扎的美军卫戍军已从原有的四百人，增加到六百人”。不久前在唐山的美海军陆战队司令骆基少将声称：“美军基本任务是保卫唐山飞机场”。该访员称：“国民党军队在美军保护下，正在继续推进，以便在满洲进行大规模的战争”。该访员继称：由于国民党军队在满洲及中国其它各地展开进攻，和平谈判已处于紧急关头，而现时美国无论用那一种形式帮助国民党，只会促进中国的内战。而美国曾公开承认要夹阻挡这种内战，不能否认现实，即美国帮助国民党军，加强了中国内部的敌视行动。为了与东北民主联军作战，美国训练与装备的精锐国民党军队，正经美国从中国各地经秦皇岛调赴满洲。在秦皇岛现已驻有美海军陆战队，由美国训练的国民党人员，现正驾驶着美国坦克与轰炸机，在东北各主要方向进行进攻与轰炸，使成千上万的居民，都死伤于美国炸弹之下，并使成千人无家可归。本溪湖以南一车站的房屋，已全部被国民党炮弹炸毁。"

On the day of the strike, Truman delivered a speech at a joint session of Congress, issuing a warning to the strikers and urging Congress to swiftly pass the following bills depriving workers of the right to strike: (1) Prohibit any trade union leader from encouraging or inciting workers to strike; (2) Deprive workers who insist on striking without reason of their priority for employment; (3) Impose criminal penalties on workers and trade union leaders who violate the provisions of the bill. This anti-labor bill has been passed by Congress. On the 26th, Truman also convened an emergency meeting with Interior Secretary Krug and others to discuss emergency countermeasures. Government authorities dispatched troops to take over the mines and implemented a lottery system and protection. However, despite the authorities' oppression, coal miners are still risking threats and persisting in their strike.

The communiqué stated that the delegation led by Bolesław Bierut, Chairman of the Polish National Assembly, and Prime Minister Edward Osóbka-Morawski, arrived in Moscow on the 23rd. Stalin and Molotov held multiple talks with them, examining the issues of continuing to develop and consolidate the friendly cooperation between the Soviet and Polish people. All the talks were conducted in a friendly manner and with mutual understanding. The communiqué pointed out that the Soviet and Polish sides have signed an agreement stipulating the cancellation of Poland's obligations during wartime due to Soviet armed assistance. It also stipulated that before Poland establishes its own metallurgical industry and arms production industry, the Soviet government will be responsible for providing long-term loans, or lending weapons and ammunition to the Polish army without compensation. It will also lend cash to Poland to help Poland overcome the lack of monetary funds to meet Poland's urgent economic needs. At the same time, in order to alleviate the food difficulties caused by war damage in Poland, the Soviet government has decided to take measures to accelerate the supply of grain to Poland. The communiqué finally declared that the negotiation also exchanged views on issues such as the German question, Soviet-Polish trade relations, cultural exchanges, and the repatriation of Polish residents from the Soviet Union and the repatriation of Russians, Ukrainians, and Lithuanians from Poland to the Soviet Union, demonstrating that the views of the two governments are consistent.
