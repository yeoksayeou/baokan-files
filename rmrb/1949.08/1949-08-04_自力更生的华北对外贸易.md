Self-Reliant Foreign Trade in North China
Wang Zuguang

(I) The Irreversible Semi-Colonial Foreign Trade of North China

    Following the signing of the unequal Treaty of Beijing in 1860, the corrupt Qing government opened Tianjin as a "free" commercial port. From then on, Tianjin became a dumping ground for imperialist goods, and the economy of North China gradually changed. Goods from various imperialist countries poured in, and local products poured out in large quantities, making Tianjin the largest trading port in North China. Along with the development of import and export trade, the first step was the processing and semi-manufacturing of export goods to adjust to export standards. Merchants engaged in export established various export industries such as packing (agricultural products, fur, bristles, etc.), tanning, and frozen eggs. This was Tianjin's earliest emerging industry. The foreign import and export trade directly stimulated the growth of domestic comprador commercial capital, which gradually strengthened and transformed into a part of industrial capital, beginning simple industrial production for domestic needs, such as matches, textiles, salt, and flour milling. Furthermore, with the gradual improvement and progress of handicraft industries, simple modernized industries such as machine flour milling, oil pressing, and wool weaving began to be established. This modernized national industry, developed on the basis of commercial capital, and the large-scale industry under foreign investment, were concentrated in the Tianjin trade port, indicating that Tianjin's industry developed from foreign trade. The foreign banks in Tianjin, with their strong capital, could even support their own country's policy toward China, and absorbed the capital of local bureaucrats, warlords, and landlords, closely linking with the banks and directly or indirectly controlling the entire financial industry. Therefore, foreign trade at that time was monopolized by foreign merchants. Furthermore, under the traitorous policies of the Kuomintang reactionary government, foreign banks even manipulated the foreign exchange market. As a result of imperialist capital intrusion, the rural areas of North China were gradually on the verge of bankruptcy.

    From the first year of the Republic of China, North China's foreign trade was always in a state of import surplus (according to Yao Xianhao's statistics in the monthly report of the puppet Central Bank, Volume 3, Issue 6: from 1912 to 1944, among the six ports in North China, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Qingdao, Yantai, Longkou, and Weihaiwei, only 1935, 1936, 1937, and 1943 had export surpluses); after the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang bureaucratic capital more frantically plundered the interests of the people. Under the U.S.-Chiang rule, on the one hand, they used ultra-low exchange rates to welcome the massive dumping of American goods. On the other hand, due to the bureaucratic capital's monopoly of industry and commerce, the national capital was squeezed to the point of being moribund, leaving the vast majority of the people in deep suffering.

    In 1946, during the Kuomintang rule, according to customs statistics, the total national import value was 1,500.11 billion legal tender, and the total export value was 412.1 billion legal tender, with the export-to-import ratio being one to four (the above statistics do not include UNRRA relief supplies, U.S. aid surplus materials to China, and large-scale customs smuggling). In a state of massive import surplus, independent and autonomous foreign trade was out of the question, which was the inevitable manifestation of a colonial economy. Furthermore, the Kuomintang reactionary government's traitorous ultra-low exchange rate policy directly aided imperialist economic aggression. For example, on March 4, 1946, when the foreign exchange market was initially opened, the foreign exchange rate was set at 2,020 legal tender, only 600 times the pre-war exchange rate, but at that time prices had risen to 3,000 or 4,000 times. Such an ultra-low exchange rate naturally rewarded imports and suffocated exports. Without strict restrictions on imports, American goods were massively dumped, and domestic products could not be exported, completely collapsing the national industry and commerce. According to the China Economic Yearbook published by the Pacific Economic Research Society in 1947, "American goods dumped, covering all aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. In clothing, there were American khaki, serge, raincoats, leather shoes, socks, belts, etc.; in food, there were milk, canned food, mandarin oranges, raisins, etc.; in housing, there were 30,000 mobile homes, steel bars, and building materials, etc.; in transportation, there were airplanes, landing crafts, jeeps, etc. Moreover, American goods were cheap. American coal sold for 100,000 yuan per ton in Shanghai, while Kailuan coal cost 130,000 yuan in the Shanghai market at that time. American canned meat was more than 80% cheaper than fresh meat in Nanjing, and American gasoline was cheaper than boiled water in Nanjing (the above were wholesale prices in Shanghai in July 1946). The dumping of American goods not only destroyed the entire national industry but also damaged agriculture. For example, after large quantities of American cotton were shipped to China, all cotton in Shaanxi went bankrupt."

    At that time (after the Japanese surrender), under the bureaucratic capital's monopoly of trade, except for bureaucratic capital and commercial firms associated with it, which could freely operate and buy low-priced foreign exchange at official prices, national capital had no way to get involved. This gradually squeezed out private trade. Therefore, the characteristics of North China's foreign trade during the Kuomintang rule before liberation were the same as in other parts of the country: a semi-colonial economy and the monopoly of bureaucratic capital. These reflected the two basic policies of the Kuomintang in foreign trade: betraying the interests of the people.

(II) Changing the Century-Old Character of Foreign Trade

    After the complete liberation of North China, the imperialist forces and the political forces of bureaucratic capitalism within the North China region were eliminated. All economic institutions of bureaucratic capital were also taken over by the People's Government. The Bank of China opened on March 15th, and the North China Foreign Trade Administration and the North China Foreign Trade Corporation were established in Tianjin on March 18th, immediately starting foreign trade business and management work. In fact, as early as February 19th, the American ship "President Filmore" had already brought 1,080 tons of tinplate, boiler tubes, and oil drums to Tianjin for trade. After four months of efforts to restore and transform the economy, in addition to eliminating the monopolistic power of bureaucratic capital, the semi-colonial nature of foreign trade for nearly a century has been changed, and a trade policy of "encouraging exports and restricting imports, determining imports based on exports, independence and autonomy, and self-reliance" has been established to replace the Kuomintang reactionaries' traitorous policy of helping imperialism plunder the interests of the Chinese people. After the business work was launched, it has initially achieved the development of domestic and foreign material exchanges, balancing import and export trade revenue and expenditure, supporting native product exports, restricting the import of non-essential goods, and managing trade and foreign exchange market transactions. Furthermore, the unprecedented upsurge in the national revolutionary situation, the liberation of the vast areas of southern China, and the linking of major liberated areas into one, the gradual restoration of urban and rural trade and production in various places, and the increasing development of foreign shipping, have all provided favorable conditions for the current restoration and development of foreign trade in North China, laying a preliminary foundation under the correct control of policies by the management agencies in the past four months.

    According to statistics from the North China Foreign Trade Administration, from March 18th to June 20th, the total import and export value was 10,290,821,917 yuan (equivalent to 10,836,891 US dollars), with imports accounting for slightly less than 44% (totaling 4,485,278,969 yuan, equivalent to 4,741,270 US dollars) and exports accounting for slightly more than 56% (totaling 5,805,542,948 yuan, equivalent to 6,095,621 US dollars). This shows that during these three months, as a result of implementing the policy of "determining imports based on exports," an import-export balance has begun to be achieved, and there has been a relative export surplus of 1.32 billion yuan, changing the colonial import surplus situation.

    Looking at the content of import and export goods, export goods are mainly domestic rural native products and processed semi-finished products, while import goods are mainly industrial raw materials and a part of civilian goods. According to customs statistics from the beginning to the end of May, carpets accounted for 15% of export goods, piece goods accounted for 11%, cashmere wool accounted for 9%, vegetable oil accounted for 9%, egg products accounted for 8%, mountain products accounted for 7%, bristles accounted for 4%, and other items accounted for 36%. Dyes and pigments accounted for 23% of import goods, chemical products accounted for 17%, metals and their products accounted for 10%, paper accounted for 10%, rubber accounted for 10%, new and used sacks accounted for 5%, machine tools accounted for 4%, vehicles and boats accounted for 4%, and other items accounted for 3%. In addition, Kailuan coal exported from Qinhuangdao (accounting for 22% of exports) was exchanged for imported flour (accounting for 25% of imports). Thus, the situation of importing large quantities of luxury goods during the Kuomintang rule has completely disappeared, and the current import goods are generally mainly industrial raw materials needed for the restoration of production.

    When foreign trade in the North China Liberated Area was initially opened, it was mainly based on "barter trade." The basic spirit of this was to exchange surplus native products and processed semi-finished products for essential means of production imported from abroad to solve the most pressing national economy and people's livelihood problems. This manifestation of "self-reliance" was the opposite of Jiang bandit's policy of relying on US aid loans to balance imports and exports.

(III) Policies of Encouraging Exports and Restricting Imports

    However, we must admit that what the enemy left behind was a shattered economic situation. Centuries of imperialist exploitation, the monopoly of bureaucratic capital, and the bankruptcy of national capital have added many difficulties for us. To transform the colonial economy and prevent the continued intrusion of imperialist economic forces, we absolutely need strict management of foreign trade. In the past four months, the foreign trade management work in North China has included the following parts: (1) Centralized control of policies, organizing private factories and merchants, and handling the registration and review of import and export merchants; (2) Concrete management and approval of import and export application permits based on the policy of encouraging exports and restricting imports; (3) Customs management of import and export goods and implementation of tariff policies; (4) Conscientiously implementing commodity inspection to improve the quality of export goods; (5) Managing the local trade market and regulating the prices of import and export commodities. The management work in these aspects has been basically successful. The basic policy of "encouraging exports and restricting imports" in foreign trade management has been implemented in many ways.

"Encouraging Exports"

    (1) In terms of foreign trade administration, the review of applications for export permits is not only generally unrestricted (except for a very small number of prohibited national defense materials and unified sales products that private merchants are not allowed to export), but also provides various conveniences and encourages importers to engage in exports as well. At the same time, it organizes private factories and merchants to carry out persuasion and education to eliminate ideological concerns among import and export merchants, such as holding symposiums for the bristle, carpet, and egg product industries, and strives to solve various existing difficulties to encourage operation and expand the scope of exports. Administrative procedures such as customs are simplified as much as possible, administrative valuations are fair and reasonable, and private merchant opinions are absorbed and improved. In terms of commodity inspection, serious inspection is carried out to improve the quality of export commodities, to promote the credibility of native product exports and strive for sales in foreign markets.

    (2) In terms of taxes and fees, the North China People's Government decided to implement a reduction and exemption of export taxes (5% to 7.5%) in the North China region from June 28th. At the same time, the 5% river works donation payable by exporters is exempted, the 4‰ export wharf donation is reduced to 2‰, the visa fee for export licenses (3‰) is waived, and the 2% foreign exchange transaction fee is stipulated to be paid by the buyer of foreign exchange. This reduces the burden on exporters by more than 10% in total.

    (3) In terms of finance, the Tianjin branch of the Bank of China provides assistance to native product exports through export loans. According to statistics, since the issuance of export loans began on March 17th, as of the end of June, various export loans totaling more than 4.34 billion yuan have been issued. According to the principle of "public first, private second," the cumulative loans to state-owned trading companies exceeded 3.5 billion yuan, and the loans to private export manufacturers reached more than 760 million yuan. In terms of assistance methods, general private export manufacturers are provided with regular pledge loans (i.e., raw goods loans totaling more than 280 million yuan), packing loans (loans before export goods are loaded onto ships totaling more than 380 million yuan), and export documentary bills (totaling 100 million yuan). In addition, credit overdrafts, import documentary bill advances, and current account overdrafts have also been launched. State-owned companies used loans to mainly acquire various native products for export. Statistics show that during this period, a large number of export goods such as bristles, wool, fur, egg products, peanuts, peach kernels, vegetable oil, soybeans, rapeseed, sesame, and soybean cake were acquired. Export loans to private export manufacturers also played an active role in supporting native product exports. Statistics show that during this period (March 17th to June 10th), the export goods supported through fixed pledge, packing, and documentary bills totaled 300,000 US dollars, accounting for about 40% of the total foreign exchange settlement exports. In addition, the promotion of exports drove the production of some small and medium-sized factories such as carpet and bristle processing industries, solving the livelihood problems of some workers. To further support the transfer of native product exports from rural areas to cities and facilitate the capital turnover of export manufacturers who directly purchase export goods from producing areas, the Tianjin branch of the Bank of China will soon launch inter-port export documentary bill business between Tianjin and various producing areas. In this way, export manufacturers can obtain financial assistance from the national bank throughout the entire business process from purchasing native products from producing areas to loading goods onto ships. Inter-port export documentary bills are available when purchasing native products, and they can be converted into raw goods loans after the goods are transported to Tianjin. The packing loan can be converted when the goods are sold abroad and a letter of credit is obtained, and the export documentary bill can be converted again when the goods are loaded onto the ship to recover all loans, which has played an active role in promoting the development of native product exports. The Tianjin Jiaotong Bank is also actively assisting in providing loans to export industries. Since the liberation of Shanghai, it has been extremely beneficial to the export of industrial products from Tianjin. The prices of industrial raw materials such as sodium sulfide, alkali, and refined salt have risen, which is conducive to directly stimulating the increase in the production of export industrial products. From May 19th to May 31st, industrial loans totaling more than 165 million yuan were issued, of which a large proportion was loaned to producers of export industrial raw materials. Jiu Da alone reached 35 million yuan during this period, directly supporting the recovery and development of export industries.

    (4) Assistance in public-private joint operations, such as after the liberation of Tianjin, the North China Foreign Trade Corporation ordered more than 500 tons of egg products from four egg factories, Hebei, Lixing, Zhongfu, and Taidong, which prompted the egg factories to start repairing factories and resuming work, and the output of each factory recovered to pre-war levels. In addition, the acquisition business of the Foreign Trade Corporation directly stimulated the enthusiasm of export manufacturers. For example, the export processing industries such as the acquisition of carpets, mountain products, and medicinal materials have obtained development opportunities under the organization and cooperation of the company. The company's own export business has acquired a large number of bristles, carpets, egg products, and vegetable oil during these four months, and has played a leading role in developing North China's export trade, becoming a main force in export trade. In order to organize unemployed carpet workers to engage in production, the Tianjin Supply and Marketing Cooperative also obtained a loan of more than 8 million yuan from the People's Bank in May, focusing on the sixth district of Tianjin, and first organized 30 carpet production groups and carpet production cooperatives, and the products produced were assisted in marketing by the Foreign Trade Corporation. Therefore, many "encouraging export" works have been initially done under the principle of benefiting both public and private sectors.

    (5) The restoration of domestic and foreign shipping and the communication of urban and rural trade also indirectly play a role in promoting export development. The opening of the Jinpu Railway on July 1st promoted the exchange of goods between the north and the south. The Nanyun River, Ziya River, Daqing River, and other inland rivers within North China have also restored the connection between urban and rural areas after the liberation of Tianjin. The rivers and ships suffered a lot of looting and destruction by the Kuomintang. Since the establishment of the North China Inland River Shipping Administration, the first step was to carry out the project of repairing rivers, removing obstacles in the inland rivers, and the North China Inland River Shipping Company organized private merchant ships to vigorously restore the shipping work of the inland rivers. Now there are about 2,000 registered inland river ships. The foreign shipping industry is also gradually recovering with the recovery of foreign trade. According to statistics from the Maritime Administration: the total tonnage of import and export ships in March was 72,926 tons, 109,206 tons in April, 102,956 tons in May, and 169,424 tons in June (June increased by 64.56% compared with May, and the trend is upward month by month). The foreign routes are also developing day by day, and in May and June, they can directly reach major international commercial ports such as New York, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Manila, Okinawa, Liverpool, Hong Kong, Moji, and Incheon. To support the recovery of the shipping industry, the Tianjin Jiaotong Bank loaned nearly 6 million yuan to the Northern Shipping Company, Tongshun Steamship Company, and Jvhe Barge Line in the form of actual discount loans to help them repair ships and machinery.

"Restricting Imports"

    The implementation of the "restricting imports" policy is mainly in two aspects: administrative management and tariff policy. The North China Foreign Trade Administration, when applying for import permits for non-production needs or non-essential goods, strictly restricts them when necessary under the principle of "determining imports based on exports and protecting national production," or some commodities are completely prohibited from being imported. The purchase of foreign exchange must be concentrated in the exchange and traded at a certain exchange rate. In these aspects of import restriction management, the balance of import and export revenue and expenditure has been basically achieved, and the imported materials are generally the most essential for production or people's livelihood.

(IV) North China's Foreign Trade is Gradually Recovering

    As a result of the implementation of the "encouraging exports and restricting imports" policy, North China's foreign trade has been gradually restored and developed. According to statistics from the North China Foreign Trade Administration, the monthly import and export figures from mid-March to June 20th are as follows: March (15 days) import 327,651,000 yuan, export 521,378,000 yuan (equivalent to import 549,797 US dollars, export 874,872 US dollars); April import 738,904,000 yuan, export 717,466,000 yuan (equivalent to import 969,442 US dollars, export 941,315 US dollars); May import 1,838,503,000 yuan, export 2,279,377,000 yuan (equivalent to import 1,821,956 US dollars, export 2,252,865 US dollars); June (20 days) import 1,580,221,000 yuan, export 2,287,322,000 yuan (equivalent to import 1,400,075 US dollars, export 2,026,568 US dollars). The total import and export in three months reached 10 billion yuan, and the import and export figures approved by the North China Foreign Trade Administration from mid-March to June 15th reached 16 billion yuan. Due to the different valuation standards of the Administration and the Customs, and the difference in time between the import and export permit visas and the actual import and export time (the time difference between approval and actual import is about one or two months), the difference between the two is more than one-third.

    According to customs statistics, many export goods in May exceeded the same period last year. Egg products in May exceeded more than 51 times the same period last year (in the first 20 days of June, it exceeded more than 14 times the same month last year, and it was equal to June 1936), medicinal materials exceeded more than 7 times in May, mountain products exceeded nearly 4 times in April, more than 19 times in May, and straw hat braids exceeded more than 4 times in April. The total export value in April exceeded 28% of April last year, May was similar to the same period last year (the former accounted for 86% of the latter), and the first 20 days of June exceeded 37% of the total month of June last year. Compared with the same period in 1936, May accounted for slightly more than 70% of 1936, and June (20 days) accounted for 86% of the total month of June in 1936 (the above are converted according to US dollar units, and the degree of US dollar devaluation is not included, and the standards of exchange rates in each period are also different, so it lacks accuracy). However, it can be certainly said that after the liberation of Tianjin, North China's foreign trade is a trend of gradual recovery and development, which is the result of the development of the revolutionary victory situation, as well as the correct control of policies and the increased enthusiasm of import and export merchants.

(V) Gains in Mastering Foreign Exchange

    The management of foreign exchange mainly includes managing designated banks, foreign banks, foreign exchange exchanges, and market management in four aspects. Its task is to cooperate with trade management, effectively use foreign exchange, master foreign exchange rates, promote exports, and restore and develop production. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to regulate the supply and demand of the foreign exchange market and vigorously develop foreign exchange operations and issue export loans to master foreign exchange positions. There have been many gains in this work.

    First of all, it has gradually gained the initiative in foreign exchange supply and demand and foreign exchange management. The first step of the Tianjin branch of the Bank of China was to strictly prohibit the pricing and circulation of foreign currency, limit the time for storage and exchange, and eliminate the black market for foreign currency. The second step was to organize foreign exchange exchanges, concentrate foreign exchange transactions, and designate banks to operate foreign exchange business. On April 11th, ten designated banks were approved, including Shanghai, Jin Cheng, Zhejiang Xingye, Zhongnan, Juxingcheng, Zhongshi, Xinhua Trust, Huabi, HSBC, and Mai Jiali, with a ratio of seven Chinese and three foreign. The approval of designated banks was very exciting for the financial community and import and export industry in Tianjin. On June 2nd, another foreign bank, Oriental Huili, was added. Striving for Chinese banks to operate foreign exchange business has won the praise of many people. At the same time, foreign banks' attitudes have also undergone new changes. They have had to abandon their consistent arrogant attitude towards the puppet Central Bank and expressed their respect for the People's Government, which the Kuomintang reactionary government could not have dreamed of.

    Since the opening of the foreign exchange exchange on April 11th, the foreign exchange rate has established the guiding role of the foreign exchange market. The reason is that the control of the exchange rate has been generally adjusted dynamically with prices. The swallowing and spitting power of the Tianjin branch of the Bank of China in the foreign exchange exchange has initially obtained the necessary regulatory role. In the past, during the Kuomintang rule, the foreign exchange rate was fixed for a long time, and the official foreign exchange rate was far lower than the price (in 1946, the ratio of the Kuomintang reactionary government's foreign exchange rate to the price was about one to seven), so that export manufacturers completely lost confidence in the exchange rate.

    Since mid-March, the Tianjin branch of the Bank of China has been in a leading position in foreign exchange operations (from mid-March to mid-June, the foreign exchange operations of the Tianjin branch of the Bank of China accounted for 44% of the city's total, while the foreign exchange operations of the puppet Central Bank last year accounted for only 36% of the city's total). Foreign banks accounted for only 24% of the total turnover, which was almost half less than the same period last year. The foreign exchange turnover of Chinese designated banks also exceeded that of foreign banks. The turnover of Chinese banks and the Bank of China accounted for three-quarters of the total turnover, changing the past situation in which foreign merchants manipulated foreign exchange (according to statistics in 1948, Chinese merchants in Tianjin only accounted for slightly more than 45% of the city's total, while foreign merchants accounted for more than 4%). Although foreign exchange work has achieved many results, the situation of foreign exchange being in short supply is certain, and the foreign exchange rate itself is still worth studying. (1) Barter trade still accounts for the vast majority of exports (more than 60%), hindering foreign exchange management work; (2) There are still many difficulties in the export materials themselves, which also affect the smooth flow of exchange sources.

(VI) Problems That Still Need to be Solved

    We can certainly say that the past semi-colonial foreign trade of North China has completely turned to a "self-reliant" situation after the transformation after liberation. But it cannot be denied that there are still many current problems, which are provided for research and reference:

    (1) The central problem of current foreign trade lies in exports. At present, the export of native products is mainly greatly affected by the difficulty of urban and rural material exchanges. According to the investigation, the reasons for hindering material exchanges include the repeated collection of donations and taxes by merchants, the difficulty of inland transportation, the inconvenience of inland exchange, and the urban prices being higher or lower than the rural prices, which affect the normal urban and rural material exchanges. Exporters are restricted when they go to the countryside to purchase export materials, thus increasing concerns. Because the source of domestic native products is not smooth, which leads to the continuous rise in export prices, it is also one of the reasons for the unfavorable export situation.

    (2) Secondly, there is the deviation problem of the foreign exchange rate. From April 18th to July 6th, the US dollar exchange rate has been adjusted 14 times, among which it is generally lower than the multiple of the rise in export prices, so that export profits can only be lower than general commercial profits. Due to the existence of the deviation problem of the exchange rate itself, export settlement is not as profitable as barter trade, so more and more people tend to do barter trade, making it difficult to grasp more of the foreign exchange obtained from exports, which is one of the important problems existing in current foreign trade.

    (3) The connection between foreign trade and the production department is still very insufficient. Because the combination of urban industry and rural production is not close enough, and there is a lack of a unified production, purchase, and sales plan for urban public and private industrial production, it is difficult to formulate a complete import plan, so that trade management is in a passive and unplanned state in terms of restricting imports.

    (4) In terms of benefiting both public and private sectors, although state-owned companies have done a lot of work, they still lack a wider range of promotion and organization of private merchants to jointly participate in the construction of the new democratic economy. The coordination of state trade business and trade administration, and foreign exchange management needs to be strengthened, and there is still a lack of strong unified leadership.

    As mentioned above, North China's foreign trade has just begun, and it still needs to go through a long and arduous struggle. There are many difficulties in the future. However, it can be certainly said that the current foreign trade situation is developing upward. The problem lies in how to strengthen organization, improve operation, strengthen management work, and closely cooperate with finance, trade, and production. This is very important.

    自力更生的华北对外贸易
    王祖光
    （一）一去不返的半殖民地的华北对外贸易
    根据一八六○年不平等的北京条约的签订，腐朽的满清政府辟天津为“自由”商埠，从此天津沦为帝国主义商品倾销市场，华北经济逐渐地改变了面貌，各国帝国主义的商品源源输入，内地土产大量涌出，这就使天津形成了华北的最大贸易港。伴随着出入口贸易的发展，首先是对出口物资的加工和半制，以调整出口的标准，经营出口的商人又成立了打包（农产物，皮毛，猪鬃等），鞣皮，冷冻鸡蛋等各种出口工业，这是天津最早的新兴工业。由于外商的进出口直接刺激了国内买办商业资本的滋长，逐渐地增强并转化为一部分产业资本，开始了单纯的为国内民需商品的工业生产，如火柴、纺织、盐业、制粉工业等。再由于手工业程度的逐渐改良进步，机器制粉、榨油、毛织等，简单的近代化工业才开始建立起来。这种以商业资本为基础发展起来的近代化民族工业，以及外商投资下的大规模工业，都集中在天津贸易港来，说明了天津工业是由对外贸易而发展起来的。而天津的外商银行，其资本雄厚的程度，甚至可以支持其本国的对华政策，并且吸收本地的官僚、军阀、地主的资本，与银行密切联系，直接间接地支配了整个金融业。因此，当时的对外贸易便是由外商一手垄断经营，更在国民党反动政府的卖国政策之下，竟由外商银行操纵外汇市场。由于帝国主义资本侵入的结果，华北农村也就日渐濒于破产了。
    华北的对外贸易，从民国元年起一直是入超的状态（根据伪中央银行月报三卷六期姚贤镐的统计：天津、秦皇岛、青岛、烟台、龙口、威海卫等华北六港口从一九一二——四四年，三十二年之间，仅有一九三五、三六、三七、四三这四年是出超的）；抗日战争后，国民党官僚资本更加疯狂的搜刮人民利益，在美蒋统治下，一方面以超低汇率迎接美货的大量倾销，另方面由于官僚资本垄断工商业，压榨得民族资本奄奄一息，使广大人民陷于水深火热的境地。
    一九四六年，国民党统治时期，据海关统计，该年全国进口总额一万五千零十一亿法币，出口总额四千一百二十一亿法币，出口与进口之比率为一比四（上项统计尚未包括联总运华救济物资及美帝援华剩余物资与大量海关走私在内）。在大量入超状态下，对外贸易是谈不到独立自主的，这是殖民地经济的必然表现。另外是国民党反动政府卖国的超低汇率政策，直接帮助了帝国主义经济侵略。例如一九四六年三月四日，最初开放外汇市场时，把外汇汇率订为二○二○元法币，仅为战前汇价的六百倍，但当时物价已高至三、四千倍。这样超低汇率，自然奖励了进口、而窒息了出口，且对进口又无严格限制，因此使美货大量倾销，国内土产无法出口，完全摧垮了民族工商业，当时情况据一九四七年太平洋经济研究社出版的中国经济年鉴所载：“美货倾销，就种类言，衣食住行无所不包，衣的方面如美国卡叽、哔叽、雨衣、皮鞋、袜子、裤带等；食的方面如牛奶、罐头食品、蜜橘、葡萄干等；住的方面有三万幢活动房屋，钢筋及建筑材料等；行的方面有飞机、登陆艇、吉普车等；且美货价格低廉，美煤运达上海售十万元一吨，开滦煤当时上海市价十三万元，美国罐头肉类比南京鲜肉价贱百分之八十以上，美国汽油比南京开水还要便宜（以上是四六年七月上海的批价），美货倾销不但毁灭了整个民族工业，也破坏了农业，如美棉大批运华后，已使陕西棉花全部破产。”
    当时（日本投降后）在官僚资本垄断贸易下，除掉官僚资本可自由经营以及与官僚资本有关的商行，可按官价买进低价外汇外，民族资本根本无法插足，这样就一步一步的排挤了私营贸易。因此，解放前国民党统治时期，华北对外贸易的特点也正如全国各地一样，一个是半殖民地性经济；一个是官僚资本的垄断。这表现了国民党对外贸易中出卖人民利益的两个基本政策。
    （二）改变了百年来对外贸易性格
    华北全面解放后，华北区内的帝国主义势力和官僚资本主义的政治势力已被肃清。官僚资本的一切经济机构，也为人民政府所接管。三月十五日中国银行开业，三月十八日华北对外贸易管理局及华北对外贸易公司在天津成立，即开始对外贸易的业务和管理工作。事实上，二月十九日美轮“费尔莫总统号”即已载铁皮、锅炉管及油桶等一千零八十吨来津交易。到现在经过四个月来努力恢复和改造的结果，除肃清了官僚资本垄断势力以外，并改变了近百年来对外贸易的半殖民地性格，树立起“奖出限入，量出为入，独立自主，自力更生”的贸易政策，以代替国民党反动派的帮助帝国主义剥夺中国人民利益的卖国政策。业务工作展开后到现在已初步地做到了开展内外物资交流、平衡进出口贸易收支、扶植土产出口和限制非必需品进口、管理贸易和外汇市场交易等。更由于全国革命形势空前高涨，广大江南地区的解放，以及各大解放区联成一片，城乡贸易和各地生产的逐渐恢复，对外航运的日趋发展，都给予了当前华北对外贸易恢复和发展的有利条件，在四个月来管理机关的正确掌握政策之下，已奠定了初步基础。
    据华北对外贸易管理局统计：自三月十八日起至六月二十日止，进出口总值一○、二九○、八二一、九一七元（折成一○、八三六、八九一美元），其中进口占百分之四四弱（计四、四八五、二七八、九六九元，合四、七四一、二七○美元），出口占百分之五六强（计五、八○五、五四二、九四八元，合六、○九五、六二一美元）。说明这三个月间，由于贯彻“量出为入”政策的结果，已开始做到出入口平衡的状态，而且相对的出超了十三亿二千万元。已改变了殖民地性的入超形势。
    就出入口物资内容来看，出口货以本国农村土产和加工半制品为主，进口货以工业原料和一部分民需品为主，自开始截至五月底为止的海关统计，出口货中地毯占１５％，匹头占１１％，羊绒毛占９％，植物油占９％，蛋品占８％，山货占７％，猪鬃占４％，其他共占３６％；进口货中染料颜料占２３％，化学制品占１７％，金属及其制品占１０％，纸类占１０％，橡胶占１０％，新旧麻袋占５％，机器工具占４％，车辆船艇占４％，其他共占３％；另外是秦皇岛出口的开滦煤（占出口的２２％）交换的进口面粉（占进口的２５％）。这样，国民党统治时期的大量奢侈品进口的形势，已根本绝迹，现在的进口货一般是以恢复生产所需要的工业原料为主。
    华北解放区对外贸易初开放时，是以“以货易货”为主的贸易，其基本精神是以本国剩余土产和加工半制产品，换取由国外进口必需的生产资料，用以解决目前最迫切的国计民生问题。这种“自力更生”的表现，是一反过去蒋匪的依靠美援贷款平衡进出口的政策的。
    （三）奖出与限入政策
    但是，我们必须承认敌人留下来的是一摊残破的经济局面。百年来帝国主义的压榨，官僚资本的垄断，民族资本的破产，给我们增加了许多困难。为了改造殖民地性的经济，防止帝国主义经济势力的继续侵入，我们完全需要对外贸易上的严格管理。四个月来，华北的对外贸易管理工作，约包括以下几个部分：（一）集中掌握政策，组织私营厂商，办理进出口商登记审查；（二）根据奖出限入政策，具体管理进出口申请许可的批准；（三）海关对进出货物的管理及掌握关税政策的实施；（四）认真执行商品检验，提高出口商品的品质；（五）管理本地贸易市场，调节进出口商品物价等，这些方面的管理工作，基本上是成功的。在对外贸易管理上的基本政策“奖出限入”，已经作了许多工作。
    “奖出方面”
    （１）对外贸易行政管理上，对申请出口许可之审核，不但一般的不受限制（除极少数禁止出口的国防物资及统销品不准私商出口外），且给予各种便利，并鼓励进口商附带经营出口：同时组织私营厂商进行说服教育，打消进出口商思想上的顾虑，例如召开猪鬃、地毯、蛋品各业座谈会等，设法解除各种存在的困难，以鼓励经营和扩大出口范围；在海关等行政管理手续上尽可能予以简化，行政估价上力求公平合理，并吸取私商意见予以改进；商品检验方面，认真检验提高出口商品品质，以推广土产出口的威信，争取国外市场的销路。
    （２）税费方面，华北人民政府决定自六月二十八日起，实行华北区减免出口征税（百分之五到七·五），同时出口商应纳之河工捐百分之五予以免征，出口码头捐千分之四减征千分之二，免除出口许可证的签证费（千分之三），外汇交易所手续费百分之二，规定由购买外汇人交纳，这样一共约可减少出口商的负担达百分之十以上。
    （３）金融方面：是由天津中国银行通过出口贷款的方式，来扶助土产出口。据统计：自三月十七日开始发放出口贷款以来，截至六月底为止，共放出各种出口贷款达四十三亿四千余万元，根据“先公后私”的原则，贷给国营贸易公司的累计在三十五亿元以上，贷给私营出口厂商的达七亿六千余万元。在扶助方式上，对一般私营出口厂商是通过定期质押贷款（即生货贷款共二亿八千余万元），打包贷款（出口物资装船出口前之贷款共三亿八千余万元），出口押汇（共一亿元）等方式贷出；另外还举办了信用透支，进口押汇垫款及活存透支等各项放款。国营公司方面利用贷款，大部分用于收购各种土产出口，统计该时期内收购有大批猪鬃、羊毛、皮毛、蛋品、花生、桃仁、植物油、大豆、菜子、葫麻、豆饼等出口货。对于私营出口厂商的出口贷款，也起着积极扶助土产出口的作用，统计这一期间内（三月十七日至六月十日），通过定押、打包、出押等方式，所扶植出口物资共合三十万美元，约占全部结汇出口总数的百分之四十；并在推动出口同时，带动了若干中小工厂的生产如地毯、猪鬃等加工工业等，解决了一部分工人的生活问题。为了进一步扶植土产出口货由乡村转入城市，便利出口厂商直接向产地采购出口物资的资金周转起见，天津中国银行不久即将举办天津与各产地间的埠际转口押汇业务。这样一来，出口厂商从产地购买土产起直到货物装上船，全部业务过程，都可获得国家银行资金上的扶助。在收购土产时有埠际转口押汇，货物运津后可转作生货贷款。在国外将货售妥取得信用证即可转作打包放款，装船出口时可再转作出口押汇，以收回全部贷款，这就对干发展土产出口发生了积极推动的作用。对出口工业贷款，也由天津交通银行积极扶助。自上海解放后，对天津市工业输出品极为有利，硫化碱、碱面、精盐等工业原料，价格上涨有利，直接刺激了输出工业品生产的增加，自五月十九日起至五月三十一日止，其间共贷出工业贷款一亿六千五百余万元，其中贷给出口工业原料生产者比重很大，仅久大一家该期间内即达三千五百万元，直接地扶助了出口工业的恢复和发展。
    （４）公私合作经营上的扶助，例如天津解放后，华北对外贸易公司向河北、利兴、中孚、泰东等四家蛋厂，先后订购蛋品达五百余吨，才促使各蛋厂开始修理工厂复工，且各家产量都恢复到战前的水平。另外，对外贸易公司的收购业务，也都直接刺激了出口厂商的积极性，如收购地毯、山货、药材等出口加工工业，都可以在公司组织合作之下获得了发展的机会；而公司本身的出口业务，在这四个月期间，收购了大量的猪鬃、地毯、蛋品、植物油等，在开展华北出口贸易上，已起了带头作用，是出口贸易上的一支主力军。还有天津市供销合作社，为了组织失业的地毯工人从事生产，五月间也曾由人民银行贷妥八百余万元，以天津市第六区为重点，首先组织了三十个地毯生产小组，及地毯生产合作社，制成的产品由对外贸易公司协助其推销。所以在公私两利原则下也初步做了许多奖出的工作。
    （５）国内外航运的恢复和城乡贸易的沟通，也间接地起着有利出口发展的作用。七月一日津浦线通车，促进了南北物资交流，华北境内南运河、子牙河、大清河等各内河，在天津解放后，也都恢复了城乡间的联系，各河道及船只都遭受国民党抢掠破坏的很多，自华北内河航运管理局成立后，首先进行了整修河道的工程，扫除内河障碍，并由华北内河航运公司组织私商船只，大力恢复内河的航运工作，现在已登记的内河船只，约在两千只左右。对外航运事业也随着对外贸易的恢复而逐渐恢复起来，按航政局统计：三月份进出口船只总吨数七二九二六吨，四月份一○九二○六吨，五月份一○二九五六吨，六月份一六九四二四吨（六月份较五月份增加达百分之六四·五六，而且逐月都是向上发展的趋势），且对外航线也日有开展，五六月间已可直达纽约、西雅图、旧金山、洛杉矶、马尼剌、冲绳岛、利物浦、香港、门司、仁川等各大国际商埠。天津交通银行为了扶助航运业的恢复，曾以折实贷款方式贷给北方船运公司，通顺轮船公司，聚合驳船行三家近六百万元，以助其装修船只机件等。
    “限入方面”
    限入政策的贯彻，主要是在行政管理和关税政策两方面，华北对外贸易管理局对于申请非生产需要或非必需品进口许可时，在量出为入保护民族生产事业原则下，予以必要的严格的限制，或有的商品根本禁止进口；在购买外汇则必须集中在交易所内，按一定牌价交易；在这几方面的限入管理上，基本上做到了进出口收支平衡，同时进口物资一般也都是生产或民需所最必需的。
    （四）华北对外贸易在逐渐恢复中
    由于“奖出限入”政策实施的结果，华北对外贸易乃得逐步恢复和发展。据华北对外贸易管理局统计，自三月中旬起至六月二十日的逐月进出口数字如下：三月份（十五天）进口三二七、六五一千元，出口五二一、三七八千元（折合进口五四九、七九七美元，出口八七四、八七二美元）；四月份进口七三八、九○四千元，出口七一七、四六六千元（折合进口九六九、四四二美元，出口九四一、三一五美元）；五月份进口一、八三八、五○三千元，出口二、二七九、三七七千元（折合进口一、八二一、九五六美元，出口二、二五二、八六五美元）；六月份（二十天）进口一、五八○、二二一千元，出口二、二八七、三二二千元（折合进口一、四○○、○七五美元，出口二、○二六、五六八美元）。总计三个月进出口达一百亿元人民币，而自三月中旬至六月十五日止的华北对外贸易管理局已批准的进出口数字达一百六十亿元人民币，因管理局与海关的计价标准不同，和进出口许可签证与实际进出口时间上的差异（进口从批准到实际进口相差时间约在一、两月以上），使两者相差达三分之一以上。
    另据海关统计，五月份许多出口货都超过上年同期，蛋品五月份超过上年同期的五十一倍多（六月份二十天内超过上年同月份十四倍多，且与一九三六年六月份相平），药材五月份超过七倍多，山货四月份超过将近四倍，五月份超过十九倍多，草帽辫四月份超过四倍多。四月份输出总值已超过上年四月份的百分之二十八，五月份与上年同期相近（前者占后者的百分之八十六），六月份二十日内又超过上年六月全月份的百分之三十七。即与一九三六年同期相比，五月份占三六年的百分之七十强，六月份（二十日）占三六年六月全月的百分之八十六（以上是按美元单位折算的，美元贬值的程度未计算在内，各期牌价的标准也有不同，故缺乏准确性）。不过，可以肯定说，天津解放后，华北对外贸易已是逐渐恢复和发展的趋势，这是由革命胜利形势开展，以及政策的正确掌握和进出口商积极性提高的结果。
    （五）外汇掌握的收获
    外汇的管理工作，主要包括管理指定银行、外商银行、外汇交易所和市场管理四个环节。它的任务，是在配合贸易管理，有效的使用外汇，掌握外汇牌价，促进输出，恢复与发展生产事业。为达到这个目的，就需要调剂外汇市场供求，和大力开展外汇经营及发放出口贷款，以便掌握外汇头寸。这方面工作已有许多收获。
    首先，已逐步地取得外汇供求和外汇管理上的主动权。天津中国银行第一步工作，是严禁了外币的计价流通和使用，限期存兑，消灭外币黑市；其次是组织外汇交易所，集中外汇交易，并指定银行经营外汇业务。四月十一日批准了十家指定银行计上海、金城、浙江兴业、中南、聚兴诚、中实、新华信托、华比、汇丰、麦加利等，中外的比例是中七外三，指定银行公布后，津市金融界及进出口业都非常兴奋，六月二日又增加东方汇理（外商）一家。争取华商银行经营外汇业务，曾博得了许多人的赞许，同时外商银行的态度也有了新的转变，他们不得不抛弃过去一贯对待伪中央银行的傲慢态度，而表示对人民政府的尊敬，这是国民党反动政府所梦想不到的。
    自四月十一日外汇交易所开业以来，外汇牌价已确立了外汇市场的指导作用；原因是牌价的掌握已大体上是随物价而机动调整，天津中国银行在外汇交易所的吞吐力量，已初步获得了必须的调剂作用，过去国民党统治时期，外汇牌价是长期固定，外汇官价远低于物价（一九四六年国民党反动政府的外汇牌价与物价对比，约为一比七），使出口厂商对牌价完全丧失信心。
    自三月中旬以来，天津中国银行在外汇经营上是占居领导地位的（自三月中旬到六月中旬三个月间，天津中国银行的外汇经营占全市的４４％，去年伪中行外汇经营仅占全市的３６％），外商银行仅占总成交数的２４％，比去年同一时期几乎减少了一半左右。而华商指定银行外汇成交数也超过了外商银行，华商银行及中国银行的成交数占总成交数的四分之三，改变了过去外商操纵国外汇兑的情况（据一九四八年统计，天津华商承作仅占全市的４５％强，外商占４％以上）。虽然，外汇工作已有许多成绩，但外汇的供不应求情况是肯定的，而外汇牌价本身，还是值得研究的问题。（１）以货易货交易仍占出口的绝大比重（百分之六十以上），妨碍了外汇管理工作；（２）出口物资本身还存在很多困难，也影响了汇源的不畅。
    （六）目前尚需解决的问题
    我们可以肯定说，过去半殖民地性的华北对外贸易，经过解放后的改造，已彻底转向“自力更生”的形势了。但不可讳言的，当前存在的问题还有许多，兹提供研究和参考：
    （１）当前对外贸易的中心问题，在于出口，目前土产出口主要受城乡物资交流困难的影响很大，据调查阻碍物资交流的原因，有行商捐税的重复征收和内地交通运输困难，内地汇兑不便，城市物价较乡村时高时低影响正常的城乡物资交流，出口商下乡采购出口物资时受限制，因而增加顾虑。因为国内土产来源不畅，致使出口货价不断上涨，也是形成出口不利的状态的原因之一。
    （２）其次，是外汇牌价的偏差问题，自四月十八日起至七月六日止，美汇牌价计调整过十四次，其中一般还是低于出口物价的上涨倍数的，使出口利润只能低于一般商业利润。因牌价本身偏差问题的存在，出口结汇便不如以货易货更为有利可图，因而做易货的愈趋增多，难于更多的掌握出口所得的外汇，这是当前对外贸易上存在的重要问题之一。
    （３）对外贸易与生产部门的联系还很不够，因城市工业与农村生产结合不够密切，城市公私营工业生产也缺乏统一的产、购、销计划，因而完整的进口计划便难于订立，致使贸易管理在限入方面，形成被动的无计划的状态。
    （４）在公私两利方面，国营公司虽已做了许多工作，但还缺乏更广泛的推动组织私商力量，共同参加新民主主义经济的建设工作；国家贸易业务和贸易行政管理，与外汇管理三方面的工作配合还需加强，目前尚缺乏强有力的统一领导。
    如上所述，华北对外贸易还刚才开始，还需要经过长期的艰苦奋斗的过程，前途上困难也很多。但目前对外贸易的形势是向上发展的，这一点却可以肯定。问题在如何加强组织，改善经营，加强管理工作，与金融、贸易、生产各方面密切配合，这是很重要的。
