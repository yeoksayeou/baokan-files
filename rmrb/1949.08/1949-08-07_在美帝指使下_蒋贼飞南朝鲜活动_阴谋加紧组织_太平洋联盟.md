Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: Reports from various sources indicate that the conspiracy of the American aggressors to instigate the formation of the so-called Pacific Alliance is intensifying. In addition to Truman ordering the bandit President Quirino to go to the United States, the bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek left Taipei on the afternoon of the 3rd and flew to a certain place in South Korea to discuss with Li Seung-man, the notorious American puppet president of South Korea, the so-called "concrete steps to launch an anti-communist alliance of Far Eastern countries." According to an Associated Press report, Chiang Kai-shek may go to Tokyo to meet MacArthur before or after meeting Li Seung-man. At the same time, bandit President Quirino, the initiator of the Pacific reactionary alliance, recently held multiple talks with Romulo, who has been actively running for the Pacific Alliance, and issued instructions to Romulo on the 3rd regarding the details of organizing the "Pacific Alliance," as the basis for Romulo's activities in Southeast Asian countries. Although Quirino has declared that this "alliance" is only an economic, political, and cultural cooperation and does not include any military agreements, he also emphasized that, with the active support of the United States, Southeast Asian countries should conclude a convention parallel to the North Atlantic Treaty. As everyone knows, the North Atlantic Treaty is an aggressive military alliance. It is reported that Quirino is scheduled to go to the United States on the 6th.

    蒋贼飞南朝鲜活动
    阴谋加紧组织“太平洋联盟”
    【新华社北平六日电】各方报道，美国侵略者策动组织所谓太平洋联盟的阴谋，正在加紧进行中。除杜鲁门已令匪总统季里诺赴美外，匪首蒋介石已于三日下午离开台北，飞赴南朝鲜某地，以与南朝鲜著名的美国傀儡总统李承晚商讨所谓“发动远东各国反共联盟的具体步骤”。据美联社消息，蒋介石可能在晤李承晚前后到东京去见麦克阿瑟。与此同时，太平洋反动联盟发起者匪总统季里诺，近与为太平洋联盟积极奔走的罗慕洛，举行多次会谈，并于三日向罗慕洛发出有关组织“太平洋联盟”细节的训令，作为罗氏到东南亚各国活动的根据。季里诺虽然扬言这个“联盟”只是经济政治与文化方面的合作，不包括任何军事约定，但其中又强调说：在美国积极的支持下，东南亚国家应缔结与北大西洋公约相并行的公约。尽人皆知，北大西洋公约正是一个侵略性的军事同盟。据息：季里诺定于六日赴美。
