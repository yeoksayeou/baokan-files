　　Learning on the Coal Pile
    Wang Fang
    The workers of the Chengzicun Coal Mine, in order to support the front, shed countless drops of blood and sweat, building a large coal pile at the pithead. Rails were laid on the surface of the pile, and as the days went by, the rails stretched farther and farther; now a round trip is almost two hundred meters.

    In early July, I followed a work team to the Cheng Mine to help the workers study. I was assigned to teach the intermediate class in the mornings, so I was free in the afternoons on the opening day. So I ran to that coal pile. More than a dozen workers, covered in black, were pushing large iron cans back and forth, sweating profusely. I stood upright beside the rails watching them work, trying to find something to talk to them about, but they clenched their teeth and didn't answer, making me feel very awkward.

    After thinking about it for a night, I decided that starting the next day, I would participate in one or two hours of production work every day. When my hands were first stained with coal dust, worker Ye Wanhe smiled and said to me, "Comrade, be careful not to get your clothes dirty!" I immediately replied, "Hey, don't say that. We intellectuals dress neatly every day, but our hearts aren't cleaner than yours. In the past, the reactionaries separated us, but now we have the opportunity to learn labor from you." The workers laughed heartily, and I felt very happy as I pushed the iron can.

    The coal mining team workers in the mine dumped the blasted coal, basket by basket, into the iron cans. The winch kept turning, pulling the iron cans from the bottom of the well, three or four hundred feet deep, to the pithead. Our work began: pulling the coal can out of the winch, pushing it onto the rails, pushing it to the end of the coal pile, overturning the can, digging out the coal with a rake, and then pushing the empty can back to the pithead. I had no experience with this kind of work. A can of coal weighed more than half a ton, and if I wasn't careful, the wheels would jump off the rails, and I would have to trouble someone to help me drag it back on. After three or five days, my skills improved quickly. When I wanted the can to turn left, I used more force with my right hand, and when I used more force with my left hand, it turned right. I rarely had the problem of "derailing" anymore. When overturning the can, I also shouted, "One, two—three!" Several times, I pushed hard for a while and then jumped onto the can to "fly an airplane." Once, I was sitting on the "airplane" in a daze and forgot that I had reached the end of the coal pile. If worker Lao Guan hadn't stopped the momentum, I would have been badly injured; therefore, I never violated work discipline again.

    Taking advantage of the frequent ten or twenty-minute breaks, I used the time to conduct guerrilla-style classes. Everyone's enthusiasm was high, and they frequently raised political questions. Among all the questions, the ones that everyone was most interested in were: "How did apes evolve into humans?" "Why did the reactionaries use religion to deceive people?" and "How do workers live in a socialist society?" etc. Therefore, we often debated these questions continuously for two or three days, and finally everyone's opinions gradually became consistent. From this process, I learned about the life experiences and ideological situations of individual workers. Those vivid scenes often pressed heavily on my heart, and I only felt that I was very empty. Especially a young worker named Gao Bingyin, who had just joined the Communist Youth League, had a great influence on my and others' thinking.

    Many workers thought that coal was transformed from stone. I took out the knowledge I had learned in school and explained its formation in simple terms. Several elderly people didn't believe it at all, saying that it was another set of deceptive "religion." Finally, I found many plant fossils in the pile of kiln stones at the pithead, and this solved all the doubts. In addition, I learned from the workers the common names of several kinds of rocks and minerals and the methods for distinguishing the quality of coal, which would have been impossible to find in book after book of foreign literature.

    In the past, I had learned a few songs, but I didn't expect the workers to welcome them so much. I wrote the lyrics of the songs on a small blackboard with a hanging tag, and then sang a sentence, and they followed and sang a sentence. The workers had a good ability to learn, and they could sing three or four songs in less than a week. They said, "Singing while working is better than anything else." On the evening of August 2nd, the moon hid behind the dark clouds and didn't come out, and the breeze made our hearts itch. The small choir was particularly enthusiastic because two more students participating in summer teaching had been added. We beat on empty cans, singing and jumping, making the brilliant lights of Shijingshan across the bank dance in front of our eyes along with us. Finally, several workers sang until they were hoarse.

    In the past month, I used many spare moments to get close to my working-class brothers. In addition to participating in labor every day, I often went to their "guo huo" (workers' dormitories), listened to their opinions and experiences, and helped them solve problems. On the other hand, their frankness, firmness, responsibility, unity, and love for their class brothers deeply educated me. I felt that I was sometimes very selfish and hypocritical, and didn't really think about the working people. For example, when I wasted a piece of coal, where would I think about the difficulty of its source? I understood even more the path we should take in the future: to unite with the laborers. Therefore, when a pitch-black hand reached my shoulder, all I felt was happiness and glory.

    Now, I have left that coal pile—our beautiful classroom, and I miss it from time to time. Because, there, more than 300,000 jin of coal passed through my hands, and one day, they will be sent to a factory. There, there are also many lovely friends who are still shedding blood and sweat, and will pave the rails on the coal pile farther and farther.

### 煤堆上的学习

　　煤堆上的学习
    王方
    城子村煤厂的工友们，为了生产支前，流了无数滴的血汗，在井口筑起了一个大煤堆。堆面铺上铁轨，日子一天天的过去，铁轨伸展得远远的，现在来回一次差不多有二百公尺了。
    七月初，我随着工作小组到城矿来帮助工友们学习。我被分派担任了上午中级班的课，因此在开课那天下午就闲着没事做，于是就跑到那个煤堆上去。十几位浑身黑的工友们正冒着满头大汗，使劲儿推着大铁罐，往返地跑。我直挺挺地站在铁轨旁瞅着他们干活，一面去找些话跟他们谈，可是他们却咬紧牙根，总不答腔，使我觉得十分蹩扭。
    考虑了一晚，我决定在第二天起，每天要参加一二点钟的生产工作。当我的双手最初染上煤渣时，工人叶万和笑着对我说：“同志啊，小心你的衣服弄脏啦！”我马上回答道：“嘿，甭这么说，咱们知识分子天天打扮得干干净净，心里可不比你们干净。过去反动派把咱们分隔开，现在有机会向你们学习劳动了。”工友们听了呷呷地大笑起来，我推了铁罐，觉得挺高兴的。
    井下的采煤组工友将炸开的煤，一篓一篓的倒到铁罐里，绞车不断地绞，把铁罐从三四百尺深的井底拉到井口。我们的工作开始了：将煤罐拉出绞车，推上轨道，推到煤堆的尽头，翻了罐，用耙儿给煤挖出来，再把空罐推回到井口。对于这种工作我毫无经验，一罐的煤半吨多，一个不留意，轮子就跳到铁轨外面，又得麻烦人家帮忙拖上去。三五天后，我的技巧进步很快，要叫罐儿向左转时右手多用力，左手用力些就向右转，很少再闹“落道”的毛病。翻罐时，我也高嚷“一，二——三！”好几次，我用力推了一阵，顺势跳上罐去“坐飞机”。一次，我坐上“飞机”迷迷糊糊地，忘了已到煤堆尽头，要不是工友老关抵住来势，我一定会被摔坏的；因此往后我再不违犯工作纪律了。
    趁着常有的一二十分钟的休息，我就利用进行游击式的上课。大家情绪很高，时时提出政治上的问题。所有的问题中，大家最感兴趣的是：“猿猴怎样才进化到人类？”“反动派为什么用宗教来骗人？”和“社会主义社会中工人怎样生活的？”等等。因此，我们常围绕着这些问题，连续辩论二三天，最后大家的意见渐渐一致起来。从这种过程中，使我了解了个别工友的生活经历和思想情况。那些活生生的场面常紧压在我的心上，我只觉得自己空虚得很。尤其是一位刚入青年团工友高丙寅，他给予我和其他的人的思想起了很大的影响。
    许多工友们都以为煤是石头变的。我便把在学校中学到的知识搬了出来，用通俗的话来说明它的成因。几位老年人，总不相信，说这也是一套骗人的“宗教”。终于，我在井口窑石堆中找到了许多植物的化石，这样才解决了所有的疑虑。此外，我从工友们那里学会了几种岩石矿物的俗名和煤质优劣的鉴别方法，如果要我在一本本的洋装书中去找寻，那是不可能的。
    过去，我曾学会过几只歌儿，想不到工友们会这么样的欢迎唱。我把歌的词儿写在一块挂签号的小黑板上，再唱一句，他们跟着唱一句。工友们的学习能力好，不到一个星期就唱上三四只。他们说：“一边生产一边唱，比什么事都强。”八月二号晚上，月亮躲在乌云后面不出来，微风吹得我们心里发痒，这个小歌咏队里因多添了二位参加暑教的同学，所以情绪特别高涨。我们敲着空罐，一面高唱着一面跳跃着，使隔岸的石景山灿烂的灯火也跟着我们在眼前跳舞起来。最后，好几位工友唱得嘶哑了。
    这一个月来，利用了许多空暇，我就去和工人阶级兄弟们靠近。每天除参加劳动外，就常到他们的“锅伙”（工人宿舍），倾听他们的意见和经历，替他们解决问题。在另一方面，他们坦白、坚定、负责、团结和对阶级兄弟们热爱的精神，深深地教育了我。我觉得自己有时是非常自私与虚伪，没有真心真意为劳动人民着想，就象烧煤罢，当多浪费一块煤时，哪里会想到它来源的困难呢？我更明白了今后我们应走的一条路：要和劳动者结合起来，因此当一只漆黑的手伸到我的肩膀的时候。我所感到的只有快乐和光荣。
    现在，我已离开了那煤堆——我们美丽的课堂，心中不时怀念着。因为，在那里曾有三十多万斤的煤从我手中经过，一天，它们将送进一个工厂里去。在那里更有着许多可爱的朋友们，他们仍流着血汗，将把煤堆上的铁轨铺得更远更远。
