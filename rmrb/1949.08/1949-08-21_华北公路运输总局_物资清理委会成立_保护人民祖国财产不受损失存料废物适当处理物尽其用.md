North China Highway Transportation Bureau

　　Materials Clearing Committee Established

Protect the People's and Motherland's Property from Loss, Appropriately Dispose of Stockpiled Materials and Waste, and Make the Best Use of Everything.

[Our Newspaper] The North China Highway Transportation Bureau, to genuinely protect the people's and motherland's property, prevent any loss of materials, and make good use of stockpiled materials and waste, passed a resolution at its bureau affairs meeting to establish a Materials Clearing Committee, directly led by the bureau director, Comrade Cao Chengzong, and others. The first meeting was held on the 8th of this month to discuss how to carry out this important task in the future. The meeting decided to first establish a group each in Ping (Beijing) and Tianjin to immediately start the clearing work. It is essential to concentrate appropriately, store, sell, utilize, and allocate and adjust according to the needs and conditions of the materials, ensuring that everything is put to good use. All previously stored auto parts, waste materials, and equipment for engineering and transportation must be sorted out, turning dead machines into live machines, and turning waste materials into useful materials. Some unpopular items that are in high demand in the market can be sold to increase revolving funds. In the old liberated areas, we should be more active and conscientious in sorting them out in the future, implementing the superior's call to protect equipment. On the 11th of this month, the bureau also notified the North China highway transportation companies and factories to conduct in-depth ideological mobilization, recognize the importance of clearing materials, and carry out the clearing work conscientiously in accordance with the principles of the Clearing Committee's resolution. Even though the continuous rain makes it difficult to move, we must implement this work, especially for things that are prone to rust, and we must quickly find ways to deal with them. In the work, we must be meticulous and conscientious, eliminate waste, and strive to complete the scope of clearing (i.e., how to deal with it) within two months. Bureau Director Cao Chengzong, and Transportation Engineering Department Directors Zhu Tianshun and Ma Ben have gone to Tianjin to directly guide the work there.

　　华北公路运输总局
  　物资清理委会成立
    保护人民祖国财产不受损失存料废物适当处理物尽其用
    【本报讯】华北公路运输总局为确实保护人民祖国财产，使所有资材不受损失，并将存物废料很好的利用起来，局务会议上，通过成立物资清理委员会，由该局局长曹承宗同志等直接领导。并于本月八日召开第一次会议，研讨今后如何开展此项重要工作。会议决定，首先在平、津各成立一个小组，立即着手清理工作，必须适当集中，按照物资的需要条件等分别保存、出卖、利用，以及分拨调剂，务使物尽其用。以往所存之汽车零件、废料以及工程、运输各方面的器材，都要加以整理，把死机器变成活机器，变废料为有用的料材；对于有些冷门而市场上很需要的东西，即可出售，增加周转资金。在老解放区今后亦应更积极更认真的去整理，贯彻上级保护器材的号召。该局并于本月十一日通知华北各公路运输公司工厂，从思想上深入动员，认清清理物资的重要，依照清理委员会的决议原则，认真进行清理，即使目前雨水连绵，不易动转，也要贯彻这一工作，尤其怕生锈的东西，更要迅速设法处理。在工作中，必须细致认真，杜绝浪费，争取两个月内完成清理范围（即应如何处理）的工作。该局曹承宗局长，运输工程处朱田顺、马奔两处长等已赴天津，直接指导该地工作。
