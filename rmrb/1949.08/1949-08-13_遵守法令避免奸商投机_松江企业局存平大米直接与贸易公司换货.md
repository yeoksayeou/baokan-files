    Complying with Laws to Avoid Profiteering by Speculators
    Songjiang Enterprise Bureau Directly Exchanges Stored Rice with Trade Company
    [This newspaper reported] Since the Peiping Military Control Commission issued a proclamation on August 7th, reiterating the North China People's Government's regulations that state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises and institutions and schools in various regions procuring materials from other places should do so through local trade companies, the state-owned enterprise management bureau of Songjiang Province in Northeast China has exchanged rice transported to Peiping with the Peiping Trade Company for cotton cloth and general merchandise. From the beginning of July, the bureau had successively transported more than two million jin of rice to Peiping, entrusting private grain shops to handle sales, which gave private merchants the opportunity for intermediate exploitation and speculation. After the Military Control Commission issued the proclamation, the person in charge of the enterprise management bureau in Peiping has exchanged the remaining 500,000 jin of rice at an appropriate price with the Peiping Trade Company for cotton cloth and undershirts, vests, towels, and other general merchandise, eliminating intermediate exploitation. In the future, rice, timber, and other goods will continue to be transported from Northeast China to be exchanged with the trade company for cotton yarn and woven goods.

    遵守法令避免奸商投机
    松江企业局存平大米直接与贸易公司换货
    【本报讯】自北平军管会八月七日颁发布告，重申华北人民政府关于各地公营工商企业及机关学校至外地采购物资者应通过当地贸易公司进行采购的规定后，东北松江省公营企业管理局已将运来平市的大米与北平贸易公司交换纱布百货。该局由七月初起陆续由东北运至平市大米二百多万斤，委托私商粮栈经手代售，致给予私商中间剥削投机的机会。自军管会颁发布告后，该企业管理局在平负责人已将现余之大米五十万斤，以适当的作价与北平贸易公司交换纱布及汗衫、背心、毛巾等百货，免去中间之剥削，今后并将陆续由东北运来大米、木材等与贸易公司交换棉纱织品。
