Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu sent a telegram today in reply to General Cheng Qian, General Chen Mingren, and others. The telegram reads as follows:

To General Cheng Qian, General Chen Mingren, and all the officers and soldiers of the uprising:

Having read your circular telegram of August 5th, which is righteous and forceful, we are extremely pleased and comforted. The victory of the Chinese people's liberation cause has become a universally recognized certainty. American imperialism and its running dogs, the remaining bandits of Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Yan Xishan, and others, are unwilling to accept defeat and are still trying to make a last-ditch struggle, but they will undoubtedly be swiftly wiped out. You, gentlemen, leading the brave soldiers of Hunan, have broken away from the reactionary camp and joined the people's revolution. Your righteous voice is well-known, and the whole country welcomes you. Looking south at the clouds over Hunan, we extend our congratulations. We hope that you will unite your subordinates and cooperate closely with the People's Liberation Army, and prepare to be reorganized into the People's Liberation Army. Educate the troops with the revolutionary spirit, change your work style, strive for progress, and fight to eliminate the remaining bandits and liberate the people of the whole country.

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 15th: (Delayed) After General Cheng Qian, General Chen Mingren, and others launched an uprising in Changsha, they issued the following circular telegram on August 5th:

To Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in Beiping, Deputy Commander Peng in Xi'an, Commander Liu and Political Commissar Deng in Nanjing, Commander Lin and Political Commissar Luo and Deng in Hankou, Commander Chen and Political Commissar Rao in Shanghai:

After the success of the Northern Expedition, Chiang Kai-shek seized power, betrayed the teachings of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, resulting in the failure of his principles and the arrival of foreign troubles. After eight years of war against Japan, the people's strength was exhausted, and we hoped for recuperation and peaceful nation-building. However, Chiang and the warmongers destroyed the Political Consultative Conference and restarted the civil war. Externally, they colluded with American imperialism, not hesitating to betray national sovereignty and humiliate the country. Internally, they carried out dictatorship even more excessively. Powerful families gathered, corruption was rampant, resulting in economic collapse and alienation between the military and the people. Chiang was forced to step down, and Li Zongren took over as acting president, reopening peace talks, which was the expectation of the whole country. During the war against Japan, Hunan sent 3 million soldiers and transported over 50 million shi of grain. The enemy's cavalry ravaged over 50 counties in Hunan, and the cruelty of the war was the worst among the provinces. After experiencing this pain, the expectation for peace is the strongest, and the support for the peace movement is also the strongest. Who knew that talking about peace was actually preparing for war, with conspiracies and deceptions that knew no shame. Therefore, the Nanjing government collapsed in no time, fled to Guangzhou, and its vitality was exhausted, with only remnants remaining. Bai Chongxi's war-mongering arguments are absurd, abandoning Wuhan, and harassing Hunan and Jiangxi, falsely claiming a scorched-earth policy, seizing public and private property, as if using the name of anti-communism could silence the people and curry favor with powerful countries. As for his reliance on the war against Japan and his delusion that a third world war would break out, allowing him to survive in a despicable and ignorant manner, it is even more contemptible. We have followed the will of the people, appealed for peace, and exhausted our voices. However, Chiang, Li, and Bai are stubbornly unrepentant, still wanting to use our southwestern and northwestern provinces as their last desperate gamble. Therefore, we can no longer tolerate it and hereby lead the entire military and people of Hunan to formally break away from the Guangzhou government based on the eight articles and twenty-four clauses proposed by the CCP as the foundation for achieving peace and implementing the peace proposal. From now on, we will stand on the people's position, join the people's democratic regime led by the CCP, and stand with the people's army, so that we can thoroughly implement the revolutionary Three Principles of the People with a new spirit, overthrow feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and American imperialism, and jointly strive to build a New Democratic China. We hope that our comrades and compatriots in the southwestern and northwestern provinces will see through the crimes of Chiang, Li, and Bai in persisting in civil war and harming the country and the people, take the people's will as their will, take the people's interests as their interests, respond unanimously, rise up to save themselves, and eliminate this remaining feudal regime that is going against the tide. The entire military and people of Hunan are determined to be the rearguard. We hereby announce this, and we hope you will take note.

Cheng Qian, Director of the Changsha Pacification Headquarters; Tang Xing and Li Mo'an, Deputy Directors; Chen Mingren, Commander of the 1st Army Corps; Fu Zhengmo, Liu Jin, Zhang Jipeng, and Xiong Xinmin, Deputy Commanders; Gu Bingkui, Peng E, and Du Ding, Army Commanders; Li Jingyi, Fang Dingfan, Tang Jinan, Bao Zhihong, Yang Xinwen, Yu Yi, and Liu Guangyu, Deputy Army Commanders; Zhang Yongbin, Xia Richang, Tang Jinan, Yang Wenbang, Liu Xunhao, Kang Pu, Wei Xuanqing, Zeng Jing, and Zhang Chengwen, Division Commanders; Liu Xing, Li Jue, Wang Jinxiu, and Cheng Gang, Deputy Commanders of the Hunan Provincial Pacification Headquarters; Peng Jieru, Deputy Commander of the Security; He Yuanding, Wang Dugong, Zhang Jitai, Ding Lian, and Yan Wu, Security Division Commanders; Jiang Heying, Commander of the Gendarmerie Regiment.

    【新华社汉口十五日电】（迟到）程潜将军、陈明仁将军等在长沙举行起义后，于八月五日发表通电如下：北平毛主席，朱总司令，西安彭副总司令，南京刘司令员，邓政委，汉口林司令员，罗政委，邓政委，上海陈司令员，饶政委：北伐成功以后，蒋介石独揽政权，背叛孙中山先生遗教，以致主义不行，外患踵至。八年抗战，民力已尽，方期休养生息，和平建国。讵料蒋与好战分子破坏政治协商会议，重起内战，外则勾结美帝国主义，不惜丧权辱国，内则肆行独裁，变本加厉。豪门聚集，贪污横行，结果经济崩溃，军民离心。蒋既被迫退位，李宗仁代为主政，和谈重开，举国喁喁。湘人在抗战期间，出兵达三百万人，输粮逾五千万石，敌骑蹂躏遍及沅湘五十余县，兵燹之酷，甲于他省。痛定思痛，期望和平最殷，于和平运动赞助亦最力。孰知言和实所以备战，阴谋欺骗，恬不知耻。故南京政府不旋踵即告倾复，流亡广州，生意早绝，残骸仅存。白崇禧主战之论，荒谬绝伦，放弃武汉，窜扰湘赣，诡言空室清野，攫取公私资财，一若假反共之名，即可内箝百姓之口，外邀强国之欢。至其狃于抗战之役，妄冀第三次世界大战爆发，从中苟延残喘，卑劣愚昧，尤属令人齿冷。潜等顺从民意，呼吁和平，声嘶力竭。而蒋与李白执迷不悟，仍欲以我西南西北各省为最后之孤注。用是忍无可忍，爰率领全湘军民，根据中共提示之八条二十四款为取得和平之基础，贯彻和平主张，正式脱离广州政府。今后当依人民立场，加入中共领导之人民民主政权，与人民军队为伍，俾能以新生之精神，彻底实行革命之三民主义，打倒封建主义，官僚资本主义与美帝国主义，共同为建立新民主之中国而奋斗。所望我西南西北各省同志同胞，洞察蒋与李白坚持内战，祸国殃民之罪恶，以人民之意旨为意旨，以人民之利益为利益，一致响应，奋起自救，铲除此倒行逆施之残余封建政权，全湘军民，誓为后盾。特此布闻，诸维察照。长沙绥署主任程潜，副主任唐星、李默庵，第一兵团司令官陈明仁，副司令官傅正模、刘进、张际鹏、熊新民，军长谷炳奎、彭锷、杜鼎，副军长李精一、方定凡、汤季楠、鲍志鸿、杨馨文、于一、刘光宇，师长张用斌、夏日长、汤季楠、杨文榜、刘埙浩、康朴、卫轩青、曾京、张诚文，湖南全省绥靖副总司令刘兴、李觉、王劲修、成刚，保安副司令彭杰如，保安师长何元鼎、王笃恭、张际泰、丁廉、颜梧，宪兵团长姜和瀛。
