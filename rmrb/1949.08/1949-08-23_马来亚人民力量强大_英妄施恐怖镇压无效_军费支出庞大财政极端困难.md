　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 22nd: TASS Prague, August 18th dispatch quoting Reuter's report, the conversation of an American sailor, Piestra, after witnessing the actual situation in Malaya, illustrates that the Malayan national liberation movement against British imperialism is growing stronger. The conversation, published in the Malayan Maxim magazine, states that Singapore has become a "military camp," and the number of troops stationed in Singapore is currently greater than during the Japanese occupation. It also says, "Now, Singapore has more police than I have seen anywhere. …Singapore is full of plainclothes police." At night, the army mobilizes to construct machine-gun emplacements, sometimes "building machine-gun nests and setting up barbed wire under the guard of police cars and tanks." Every train is heavily guarded, with guards stationed on the roofs, and special flatcars equipped for mounting machine guns. Local laws also stipulate that "anyone arrested for carrying weapons or accompanying someone carrying weapons will be sentenced to death according to the law." Since the declaration of a state of emergency in Malaya in 1948, forty-seven people have been hanged for carrying weapons. The war between the British army and the People's Liberation Army is approaching Singapore. The guerrillas have won the support of the vast majority of the Malayan people in their struggle for independence.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 22nd: According to Reuters, quoting a Singapore correspondent for the London Financial Times, the financial situation in Malaya (including Singapore) is in dire straits. "The increasing trade deficit has caused the exchange rate between the Straits dollar and the pound to fall. The Straits dollar's exchange rate against telegraphic transfer pounds has been falling for the past eight days and is expected to continue to fall." "The increase in the trade deficit is due to the drop in rubber prices, while Malaya's industry and economy depend on rubber." The correspondent also said: "The difficulty in suppressing the activities of bandits (referring to the Malayan people fighting for survival and independence) means that a large number of troops will be needed for some time to come. …The Malayan administrative structure is undoubtedly large and top-heavy. In this situation, austerity is difficult to implement."
　　According to the correspondent, the British colonial authorities are clearly not considering "austerity" regarding these heavy military expenditures and the huge bureaucracy. What they want to "tighten" is to stop the implementation of certain social welfare, education, and public works projects. It is estimated that the current expenditure for suppression is 30,000 pounds per day. The federal government's treasury has been empty since the beginning of this year, and it is estimated that the deficit will not be less than 50 million US dollars by the end of this year. The correspondent said: Both the Singapore and the Malayan Federation governments are facing continuous demands for wage increases from employees in general public utilities.

  　英妄施恐怖镇压无效
    军费支出庞大财政极端困难
    【新华社北平二十二日电】塔斯社布拉格十八日电引电通社报道，美国水手彼斯特拉目睹马来亚实况后的谈话，说明反对英帝国主义者的马来亚民族解放运动正日益强大。登载在马来亚箴言杂志上的那篇谈话中说，新加坡已经变成“军营”，目前新加坡所驻扎的军队比日本占领时期还多。又说，“现在，新加坡的警察比我所看到的任何地方的警察都要多。……新加坡市内到处是便衣警察”。在夜间，军队出动构筑机枪工事，有时“在警车和坦克车的警卫之下构筑机枪巢和架设铁丝网”。每列火车都密布警卫，除了车顶上布置着卫兵外，列车中还特别备有专架设机枪的平台车皮。当地的法律并规定“凡因携带武器而被捕或与携带武器的人相伴随的人，均将依照法律被处死刑”。自一九四八年马来亚宣布紧急状态以来，已有四十七人因携带武器而被处绞刑。英国军队与人民解放军的战事正逼近新加坡。游击队在争取独立的斗争中已获得马来亚绝大多数人民的拥护。
    【新华社北平二十二日电】据路透社引伦敦金融时报驻新加坡记者消息称：马来亚（包括新加坡在内）的财政情况正处在困境中，“入超的日益增加已使海峡币与英镑的比价下跌，过去八天内海峡币对电汇英镑的比价已在下跌，大约还要继续下跌”。“入超的增加是因为橡皮价格的跌落，而马来亚的工业及经济则依赖着橡皮”。该记者又说：“对匪徒（按指为求生存与独立而斗争的马来亚人民）活动的镇压上的困难，使今后一个时期还需要使用大批军队。……马来亚行政机构无疑地是重大而头重脚轻的。在这种情形下，紧缩难以实施。”
    据该记者说，英国殖民当局显然不考虑“紧缩”这些沉重的军费负担与庞大的官僚机构，要“紧缩”的倒是停止实行某些社会福利，教育及公共工程的计划。据估计，目前用于镇压的费用每天三万镑。自今年初以来联邦政府的财库就已空了，估计今年年底亏空将不会少于五千万美元。该记者说：新加坡和马来亚联邦这两个政府都面临着关于一般公共事业中职工方面继续不断的增资要求。
