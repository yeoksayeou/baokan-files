    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th. The CCP Central Northeast Bureau and the Northeast Administrative Committee jointly issued a notice on August 2nd regarding the commemoration of the fourth anniversary of "August 15th." The notice stated: "August 15th" is the great day when the people of Northeast China, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, persisted in a long-term war of resistance, especially with the direct assistance of the powerful Soviet Union in sending troops to Northeast China to annihilate the Japanese invaders' Kwantung Army, and won liberation. This year's "August 15th" is also the time when the people of Northeast China and compatriots across the country, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, have defeated the running dogs of American imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, making the complete liberation of Northeast China and entering a new period of economic construction; the complete liberation of China will also appear soon. In welcoming this great festival, all Communist Party members, working cadres, and all people in the Northeast should carry out arduous production and construction with a high degree of enthusiasm and a spirit of overcoming difficulties. The notice pointed out: After the "August 15th" victory, the people of Northeast China have more deeply experienced the unforgettable great friendship and assistance of the Soviet Union to the Chinese people's struggle for independence, democracy, and freedom. Now, when imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries are implementing an armed blockade against the Chinese people, the Soviet Union and Northeast China have smoothly concluded an agreement to exchange goods with each other. This clear contrast, like countless past facts, proves the undeniable truth pointed out by Chairman Mao: "Internationally, we belong to the anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union. True friendship and assistance can only be found in this direction, and not in the direction of the imperialist front." The notice stated: The people of Northeast China are preparing to formally establish the Northeast General Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association on this year's "August 15th" to strengthen and consolidate the deep friendship between the people of Northeast China and the Soviet people, absorb more of the Soviet Union's rich experience in construction, and strive to complete the arduous tasks of economic and cultural construction in Northeast China. It will also systematically publicize the friendly history of the Chinese and Soviet people to further consolidate Sino-Soviet relations. The notice called on all Communist Party members and all people in Northeast China to conscientiously implement Chairman Mao's instructions, engage in arduous construction, guard against arrogance and rashness, practice strict economy, overcome difficulties, unite with compatriots across the country, crush the enemy's sinister blockade, and crush all conspiracies headed by American imperialism to undermine the Chinese people's peaceful construction. At the same time, it is necessary to vigorously support the national liberation war and strengthen the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers. The notice stipulated that in commemoration of the fourth anniversary of "August 15th," major cities in Northeast China should hold mass rallies and parades; small cities and villages should also hold celebrations based on specific circumstances, and use forums, lectures, and literary and artistic activities to widely publicize the above-mentioned contents.

    中共中央东北局、东北行政委员会联合通知
    纪念“八一五”四周年
    学习苏联经验完成新东北建设
    厉行节约克服困难粉碎敌封锁
    【新华社沈阳六日电】中共中央东北局及东北行政委员会于八月二日联合发布关于纪念“八、一五”四周年的通知。通知中说：“八一五”是东北人民在中国共产党毛主席的领导下坚持长期抗战，特别是在强大苏联出兵东北歼灭日寇关东军的直接帮助下，获得解放的伟大日子。今年的“八一五”，又是东北人民和全国同胞在毛主席的英明领导下，战胜了美帝国主义的走狗国民党反动派，使东北全部解放并已进入经济建设的新时期；全中国完全解放的日子亦将很快出现。在迎接这个伟大节日的时候，东北全体共产党员、工作干部和全体人民，均应以高度的积极性和克服困难的精神进行艰巨的生产建设。通知指出：东北人民在“八一五”胜利后，已更深刻地体验了苏联对中国人民争取独立、民主、自由的斗争的永远不能忘记的伟大友谊的援助。现在当帝国主义和国民党反动派对中国人民实行武装封锁的时候，而苏联与东北则顺利地订立了互相交换商品的协定。这种显明的对照，和过去无数次的事实一样，证明了毛主席所指出的这个千真万确的真理：“我们在国际上是属于以苏联为首的反帝国主义战线一方面的，真正的友谊的援助只能向这方面去找，而不能向帝国主义战线一方面去找”。通知中说：东北人民止准备在今年的“八一五”正式成立中苏友好协会东北总分会，加强与巩固东北人民与苏联人民的深厚友谊，更多地吸收苏联建设的丰富经验，努力完成东北经济与文化建设的艰巨任务，并将有系统地宣传中苏人民的友好历史，进一步巩固中苏关系。通知号召东北全体共产党员、全体人民必须认真实行毛主席的指示，艰苦建设，戒骄戒躁，厉行节约，克服困难，与全国同胞团结一致，粉碎敌人的罪恶封锁，粉碎以美帝国主义为首的一切破坏中国人民进行和平建设的阴谋。同时，要努力支援全国解放战争，并加强优待烈属、军属的工作。通知中规定：为纪念“八一五”四周年，东北各大城市均应举行群众性的集会与游行；小城市和乡村亦应根据具体情况举行庆祝，并利用座谈、讲演、文艺活动形式，广泛宣传上述各项内容。
