    Consistent Joy
    —Notes from Observing the Beiping Municipal People's Representative Conference
    By Our Reporter Er Dong

    Everything that has happened and developed in Beiping in the half-year since liberation has brought people's moral concepts (or rather, good wishes) into unprecedented alignment with the government's administrative measures; morality and politics have begun to align. When Mayor Ye Jianying, chairman of the conference, spoke about this point in his opening speech, he explained that the people demand the overthrow of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital, and the construction of a new, people's democratic Beiping. The People's Government takes this demand of the people as the goal of all its work. The government is the people's, relies on the people, and serves the people. It has the responsibility and obligation to report its work to its people and listen to the people's criticisms of its work. He very sincerely and humbly asked the representatives from all walks of life to supervise the government and advise the government, like masters towards their servants.

    The people have the right to listen to the government's work reports and criticize the government's work. Now, this is a common thing; but, except for the recent half-year, it has never happened in the history of Beiping. One representative said that even if the Kuomintang government occasionally allowed the people to say a few words, it only allowed them to say those words that were beneficial to them; otherwise, it would not allow them. Tian Lun, a primary school teacher and representative of the Beiping Democratic Women's Federation and the Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Union, said that all constructions of the ruling class are for personal gain, so of course they would not solicit our opinions, and we couldn't even ask. Today, she was so happy to be a representative that she wore new clothes. She was happy about everything she saw when she entered the door, causing the whole room to burst into laughter.

    Past old regimes suppressed the people from speaking and venting their anger, but today, as Chairman Dong of the North China People's Government said, government personnel do not receive salaries (the retained old personnel only receive a few hundred catties of millet), and take the lead in practicing thrift, which is no less than the most money-saving and honest government in the world. It diligently clears out bandits and special agents, treats diseases, removes garbage, provides loans to support production, and constantly holds large and small meetings to solicit criticisms and suggestions on the government's work (many people mentioned this in their speeches)... This makes everyone feel an uncontrollable joy: they have become the masters of the country! Mr. Wu Han of the Beiping branch of the China Democratic League, after talking about this historical change, expressed his deep gratitude to Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, he emphasized that even if the current government has not yet formed a complete democratic form, it has the essence of people's democracy. It should be said to be a true people's government because it truly serves the people.

    For this reason, everyone sincerely and practically expressed their hopes for the People's Government and their own direction of efforts: worker representative Yuan Zhi said that he would mobilize the vast number of workers to work hard and build a mansion – the new Beiping – in a planned way; farmer representative Shi Dehai, after explaining that under the guidance and assistance of the People's Government, wasteland has been reduced and crops have been planted, further hoped that everyone would study how to grow crops better, and expressed his intention to organize for production. Commercial representative Liu Yifeng hoped to open more yarn factories to absorb idle funds and a large amount of labor into the factories, eradicating hoarding and speculation. Industrial representative Zhang Jiantang hoped that the government would further implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital. Other speakers also expressed their willingness to assist the government in building a new Beiping, calling it their responsibility. Guest Guo Moruo specifically put forward a splendid vision: to build the flat Beiping into a three-dimensional, modern city like Moscow. He said that Moscow, with the world's longest and most beautiful subway and the Moscow Palace of Labor, which will be taller than the skyscrapers of New York, can definitely be built in Beiping in not too long. After comparing the objective and subjective conditions of the October Revolution in Russia with those of China today, he believed that our conditions are better, so as long as we work together, construction will be faster.

    The basic spirit of all the speeches of the guests and representatives is consistent with the suggestions made by Comrade Zhao Zhensheng, deputy secretary of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the conference. These suggestions are to eliminate the sabotage activities of the Kuomintang reactionaries and bandits and special agents, continue to consolidate the revolutionary democratic order; vigorously develop public and private production; strengthen market management and control prices; restore and develop the people's education cause, and so on.

    This unity under the leadership of the people's democratic regime will inevitably generate great strength, as many guests and representatives said, to overcome all difficulties and build the new people's democratic Beiping into a true production city.

    一致的喜悦
    ——北平市各界代表会旁听记
    本报记者  而东
    解放以后半年来在北平发生与发展着的一切，使人们的道德观念（或者说是善良的愿望）与政府的行政设施从来未有地开始一致起来，道德与政治开始一致起来。大会主席叶剑英市长在开幕词中讲到这一点时，解释说，人民要求推翻帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资本的统治，建设人民民主的新北平，人民政府即以人民此种要求作为自己一切工作的目标。政府是人民的，依靠人民，为人民服务的，它有责任、有义务向自己的人民报告自己的工作，听取人民对工作的批评。他非常诚挚而谦虚地要求各界代表监督政府、提示政府，象主人对于自己的仆役一样。
    人民有权听取政府的工作报告，批评政府的工作，现在来说是件平常的事情；但是，除了最近的半年，北平的历史上是从来未有过的。有一个代表说，国民党的政府即使有时也偶然允许人民说几句话，但只是允许说那些对他们有利的话，否则就不行。北平民主妇联与中小学教职联的代表田纶是个小学教员，她说，统治阶级一切建设都是为个人私利，当然不会征求咱们大家的意见，咱问也问不着。今天她为自己能当代表而高兴得穿了新衣服，一进门子看见任何一点什么都高兴，说得全场漾起哄然的欢笑。
    历来的旧政权压制着人民不能说话，不能出气，而今天，如华北人民政府董主席所说，政府人员是不领薪水（留用的旧人员也不过领几百斤小米），带头节约，不啻为世界上最省钱、最廉洁的政府。它勤劳地为人民清除匪特，治病，除垃圾，贷款扶植生产，不断召开大会小会，征求对政府工作的批评与建议（不少人讲话中这样提到），……这就使每个人都感到一种不能抑止的愉悦：自己成了国家的主人了！民盟北平支部的吴晗先生在讲了这个历史的变化后，一方面表示了他对毛主席、中国共产党与人民解放军的深切的感谢，一方面强调的说明，即使现在的政府还没有形成完满的民主形式，但它具有人民民主的实质，它应该说是真实的人民政府，因为它是真正为人民服务的。
    由于这个原故，大家一致诚恳切实地表示出自己对人民政府的希望与自己的努力方向：工人代表袁峙说，他要发动广大工友努力作工，有计划地建设大厦——新北平；农民代表施德海在说明经过人民政府的指导帮助，荒地已见减少，庄稼都已种上之后，他进一步希望大家研究怎样把庄稼种得更好，并表示要组织起来闹生产。商业界代表刘一峰希望多开些纱厂，把游资和大量劳动力吸收到工厂中去，根绝囤积与投机现象。工业界代表张建堂希望政府进一步贯彻劳资两利政策，其他讲话的也表示要协助政府建设新北平，大家把这称为自己的责任。来宾郭沫若先生特别提出灿烂的远景：把平面的北平建设成立体的象莫斯科一样的近代化的城市，他说，有着世界上最长最美的地下铁道和将要建成的高过纽约摩天大楼的莫斯科劳动宫，在北平一定可以不要太久就建设起来的。他把俄国十月革命当时与中国今天的主客观条件加以对比后，认为我们的条件是更好一些，所以只要我们一致努力，建设必将更快一些。
    所有来宾与代表们的发言，其基本精神与中共北平市委副书记赵振声同志在大会上所提的建议是一致的。这些建议就是清除国民党反动派与匪特破坏活动，继续巩固革命的民主秩序；大规模发展公私生产；加强市场管理，掌握物价；恢复与发展人民教育事业等等。
    这种在人民民主政权领导下的团结一致，必将发生伟大的力量，如许多来宾与代表所说，克服一切困难，把人民民主的新北平建成真正的生产城市。
