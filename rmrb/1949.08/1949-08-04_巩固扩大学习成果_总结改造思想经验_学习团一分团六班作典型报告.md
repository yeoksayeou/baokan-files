[Beijing News] The summer study group has been in session for two weeks. After studying "Attitude and Method of Study," "Labor Creates the World," "Class Struggle," and "Revolutionary World Outlook," the students have made significant progress. To consolidate and expand the learning results, the students made study summaries, and the groups launched discussions on the summaries.

The sixth class of the first detachment held a report meeting on typical summaries on the 2nd. Eight students reported on the process of ideological transformation at the meeting, which also influenced and educated more than 50 students present.

Class cadre Xiang Jingying explained the significance of the meeting and pointed out: "The reason why the students who made the reports have achieved such results is due to two reasons: first, they relied on their own honest learning and humbly and sincerely demanded progress. Second, it is the help given by the students in the group life."

The first to speak was Zhang Kewen from the first group. She did not speak at the group discussions at first. When she heard different opinions, she felt that this was reasonable and that was right. After listening to Comrade Ai Siqi's report on "Historical Materialism," she suddenly realized that a person's speech has a viewpoint, and listening to speech also needs to have a viewpoint. Moreover, it is most correct to look at problems from the standpoint of the proletariat. She said: "I understood this method, I spoke at the discussion, and I dared to debate with incorrect speeches."

Zhang Zhifen, who used to bury herself in books and refused to "sacrifice" any reading time, wanted to take this opportunity to transform herself when she entered the study group, but she was afraid of affecting her reading plan, so she had not decided. But finally, with the mentality of trying, she entered the group.

In the past, she believed that people who study science can ignore politics and still serve the people without being selfish. After liberation, this view wavered. After listening to several reports in the study group, she realized that science has class character, and she also knew that to serve the people well, she must study politics. To study politics and transform oneself, one must go to the masses and study and progress together. Zhang Zhifen painfully pointed out: "In order to read books and refuse to sacrifice a little time for collective activities or do something for everyone, what about transformation, what about serving the people."

Guan Zhenjie from the fourth group, who was liberated from the shackles of bourgeois social science theory, recounted the poison he had suffered. In his year at Peking University, he chose Zhou Zuoren's economics and Zhang Foquan's political science. The old economics only talked about production, transportation, supply and sales, profits... From the horizontal aspect, it could not see the productive forces and production relations, and from the vertical aspect, it could not see that labor creates the world and class struggle promotes the development of history. The old political science emphasized the sacred and inviolable nature of "human rights" and the inseparability of human rights and private property. Bourgeois democracy and freedom are based on private property rights. Guan Zhenjie said: "I expect peace. But the illusion of peace finally shattered. I have been worried about the future of China and felt very painful and could not explain it. But after I studied the history of social development, I realized that in class society, there must be class struggle, and it is precisely class struggle that promotes the development of the history of class society. Today, I realize that the freedom and democracy of the bourgeoisie based on private property fully demonstrates the shamelessness and卑鄙 of the exploiting classes." Finally, he said excitedly: "The past mistakes were completely influenced by the bourgeois social science theory. After two weeks of study, I was liberated. I wholeheartedly support Marxism-Leninism and support the Communist Party."

Feng Mingzhao, who came from the countryside, although on the surface did not despise the peasants, but in his bones he despised labor. Because he was an intellectual, influenced by the Kuomintang, he was not interested in politics. He went to university and wanted to be a professor. He felt that being a professor was very aloof and could be separated from reality. After listening to several reports, he knew that a person cannot be separated from reality, should understand the laws of social development, and participate in promoting the development of history. And he realized that not only politics and economics have class character, but also thought and morality have class character. Everyone has a class position, and class struggle is also an objective fact.

Pan Yinxuan from the fourth group once wanted to build bridges and roads to repair merit and serve the people. After studying at the Institute of Technology, he wanted to set up a factory to supply farmers with agricultural machinery. Today, he knows that serving the people is to promote the progress of history, to run into the ranks of the people, and to stand on the proletariat's position. Finally, he said: "In the past, I thought that the victory of the Communist Party was only because of Chairman Mao. Now I know the close relationship between the leader and the masses. Separated from the masses, nothing can be accomplished."

During the free speech, Tao Shilong, the leader of the second group, introduced the progress of their group meeting. At the beginning, the discussion was not good. The second time he asked everyone to prepare, and the speeches were enthusiastic during the meeting. Everyone thought it was very successful, but in fact it was pedantic and full of academic air. After listening to Comrade Ai Siqi's report, he knew that it was a complete failure because it was not linked to reality. Later, there were many meetings, and although the students supported it, the content was not substantial. He said: "The leaders criticized me for being divorced from the masses. I thought, I am doing things so vigorously for everyone, and the students also support me, and I am still divorced from the masses?" After returning, the students reflected: there were too many meetings, the preparation was not sufficient, all arrangements were from top to bottom, and the connection in life was not enough, the speeches were not honest enough, not exposing their own thoughts, and the criticisms were not deep enough. After the review, a "home" was arranged, so that everyone often played and chatted together, and the understanding between each other was deepened. From the third week, the discussion outline was individually solicited from the students, and the group meeting was also more meaningful. Tao Shilong finally emphasized: "The success of the group meeting is the credit of all the students, and the failure of the group meeting is the mistake of the leadership."

Comrade Qu Yuan, the director of the detachment, explained that in the first stage of the study, we have discovered many problems, but it is still not enough. We have this requirement in our thoughts - to connect with reality, combine with workers and peasants, and serve the people. But how to practice these understandings and requirements is what we will learn in the next stage. How to correctly use our strength, how to make our enthusiasm for learning and work last, and how to realize theory, this requires organization to guarantee. Therefore, we must further study the youth organization - the Communist Youth League. Secondly, the students must clarify that our scope of work is the school, and the object is the students. We should pick up the weapons of Marxism-Leninism to arm ourselves.

Deputy Director Zhang Ding emphasized: "It is not possible to transform behind closed doors. We must help each other and correctly grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. At the same time, in order to study Marxism-Leninism well and constantly improve ourselves, it is necessary to ask the organization to guarantee that it is necessary to be close to the organization. The Communist Youth League is a school of Marxism-Leninism, cultivating and educating this generation of young people. Therefore, we cannot ignore this organization, we should care about and understand this organization, and strive to participate in this organization."

Comrade Peng Peiyun believes that we have already experienced the learning method of combining theory with practice from practice, and the importance of transforming the ideology of intellectuals. We must adhere to this learning method and apply it to our lifelong learning. She also said: Everyone needs to further analyze and criticize their already exposed old ideas, and more specifically and clearly understand the class roots and historical roots of these ideas. The more deeply the old self is criticized, the better we can establish a new outlook on life. Finally, she reminded everyone: We must make appropriate estimates of our progress, especially not to be complacent because we have initially accepted the new theory. For intellectuals, accepting theory is much easier than turning it into action and melting it into one's own feelings. We must be vigilant against the restoration of old ideas at all times and constantly seek progress.

The atmosphere of the meeting was serious. In the two-hour report, everyone listened carefully to every sentence and every word, and sometimes there was a burst of applause. This typical report clearly told us the general process of ideological transformation. Undoubtedly, everyone is transforming and progressing, but it is not enough. We must continue to work hard and continue to improve. And this report meeting has greatly helped us. Just as Comrade Wang Jingxian said: "The summary report consolidated its own progress and also educated every student present."

Finally, the students sang "Go, follow Mao Zedong!" Filled with infinite confidence in transforming themselves, they excitedly walked out of the meeting place.

    巩固扩大学习成果
    总结改造思想经验
    学习团一分团六班作典型报告
    【本市讯】暑期学习团开学两个礼拜，同学们学了“学习态度和方法”、“劳动创造世界”、“阶级斗争”和“革命人生观”后，都有了显著的进步。为了巩固、扩大学习成果，同学们做了学习总结，小组里并展开了关于总结的讨论。
    第一分团的六班在二日举行了总结典型的报告会，有八位同学在会上报告了思想转变的过程，同时也影响、教育了在座的五十余位同学。
    班干事项精英说明了开会意义，并且指出：“做报告的同学，所以有这样的成果，是有两个原因：第一是靠自己老老实实的学习，虚心诚恳的要求进步。其次是小组生活中同学们所给的帮助。”
    第一个发言的是第一组的张可文，她起初在小组讨论会上是不发言的，听到了不同的说法时，觉得这个有理，那个也对。在听了艾思奇同志的“唯物史观”报告之后，她恍然觉悟到一个人讲话是有观点的，听话也是须要有观点的。而且只有站在无产阶级立场去看问题是最正确的。她说：“我懂得了这方法，我在讨论会上发言了，而且敢和不正确的发言辩论。”
    曾经钻在书堆里，拒绝“牺牲”任何读书时间的张芷芬，入学习团时，她很想借这机会，改造自己，但又怕影响了自己的读书计划，所以一直没决定，但终于抱着尝试一下的心情入了团。
    在以前，她认为学科学的人，可以不问政治，一样的可以为人民服务，而且是不自私的。解放后，这一个看法动摇了。入学习团听了几次报告，认清了科学是有阶级性的，而她又知道了要很好的为人民服务，必须学习政治。要学习政治、改造自己，就必须到群众中去，共同学习，共同进步。张芷芬沈痛地指出：“为了读书而拒绝牺牲一点时间作集体活动，或者为大家做一点事情，还谈什么改造，还谈什么为人民服务。”
    从资产阶级社会科学理论的束缚里解放了出来的第四组的关振洁，诉述了他所受的毒害。在北大一年，他选了周作仁的经济学和张佛泉的政治学。旧的经济学，只讲生产、运输、供销、利润…从横的方面看不到生产力与生产关系，从纵的方面也看不到劳动创造世界和阶级斗争推动了历史的发展。旧的政治学强调“人权”的神圣不可侵犯性，和人权与私有财产的不可分性，资产阶级的民主和自由都是建立在私产权上的。关振洁说：“我期望和平。但和平的幻想终于破灭了，我一直担心着中国的前途，觉得很痛苦，无以自解。但当我学了社会发展史之后，认清了阶级社会里是必定有阶级斗争，而且正是阶级斗争推动了阶级社会历史的发展。今天，我认清了资产阶级建立在私产权上的自由与民主，是充分表现了剥削阶级的无耻和卑鄙。”最后他激动地说：“过去的错误，完全是受了资产阶级社会科学理论的影响，经过了两个礼拜的学习，我被解放了。我衷心拥护马列主义，拥护共产党。”
    来自农村的冯明照，虽然表面上没有什么瞧不起农民，但骨子里却轻视劳动。因为自己是知识分子，受了国民党的影响，对政治不感兴趣，念大学，想做教授，觉得做教授很清高，可以脱离现实。听了几次报告，知道了一个人是不能脱离现实的，应该了解社会发展的规律，同时参加推动历史的发展。并且认清了不仅政治经济有阶级性，思想、道德都有阶级性，每一个人都有阶级立场，而阶级斗争也是客观存在的事实。
    四组的潘隐萱曾经想造桥补路修功德来为人民服务。念了工学院以后，想办工厂供给农民农业机械。今天，知道了为人民服务是推动历史的进展，要跑到人民的队伍里去，站在无产阶级立场才行。最后他说：“以前我以为共产党的胜利只是因为有了毛主席，现在我知道了领袖和群众关系的密切，脱离了群众，就什么也干不成。”
    自由发言的时候，第二组组长陶世龙介绍了他们小组会的进步。在开始时，讨论会开不好；第二次他要大家准备，开会时发言踊跃了，大家以为很成功，但事实上是咬文嚼字，充满了学究气。听了艾思奇同志的报告，知道完全失败，因为没有联系实际。后来开会多，同学们虽然支持，但内容不充实。他说：“领导上批评我脱离群众，我想，我这样起劲为大家做事，同学们也支持我，还脱离群众？”回去后同学们的反映是：开会太多，准备不充分，一切布置自上而下，而且生活上联系不够，发言还不够老实，不暴露自己思想，批评也不能深刻。检讨后，布置了一个“家”，让大家常在一起玩、漫谈，相互间认识加深了，第三周开始，讨论提纲个别的征求了同学们的意见，小组会也开得有内容了。陶世龙最后强调：“小组会成功，是全体同学的功绩，小组会失败，是领导上的错误。”
    分团主任屈元同志说明在第一阶段的学习中，我们已发现了很多问题，但还是不够的，我们思想上有这一个要求——联系实际，与工农结合，为人民服务；但怎样实践这些认识与要求，这就是我们下一阶段要学习的。怎样正确运用我们的力量，怎样使我们学习与工作的热情持久，怎样使理论实现，这就需要组织来保证。因此我们要进一步来研究青年的组织——青年团。其次，同学们必须明确我们的工作范围是学校，对象是同学。我们应该拿起马列主义的武装来武装自己。
    副主任张定同志强调：“闭门改造是不行的，要大家互相帮助，正确的掌握批评与自我批评的武器。同时，为了很好的学习马列主义，不断的提高自己，要求组织来保证，靠拢组织是必要的。青年团是马列主义的学校，培养、教育这一代青年的。所以我们不能忽视这一个组织，应该关心、了解这一组织，并且争取参加这一个组织。”
    彭佩云同志认为，我们已经从实践中体验了理论联系实际的学习方法，对于改造知识分子思想的重要性，我们要坚持这种学习方法，把它应用于我们一生的学习中。她又说：大家还需要进一步分析与批判自己已经暴露的旧思想，更加具体、更加明确地认识这些思想的阶级根源与历史根源，把旧的自己批判得越深刻，才能更好地树立新人生观。最后她提醒大家：对自己的进步，要作适当的估计，特别是不能因为初步接受了新理论而自满。对于知识分子来讲，接受理论，较之使它变成行动，融化在自己感情之中是容易得多，我们要随时随地警惕旧思想的复辟，不断的求进步。
    会场的空气是严肃的。在两个多钟头的报告中，大家一直认真地听取着每一句话、每一个字，有时也爆发一阵掌声。这一个典型报告，很清楚地告诉了我们一般的思想改造过程。无疑的，大家都在改造，都在进步，但都是不够的，我们还须继续努力，继续提高。而这次报告会也大大的帮助了我们。正象汪静娴同志所说：“总结报告巩固了自己的进步，也教育了每一个在场的同学。”
    最后，同学们唱着“走，跟着毛泽东走！”充满了对改造自己的无限信心，兴奋地走出了会场。
