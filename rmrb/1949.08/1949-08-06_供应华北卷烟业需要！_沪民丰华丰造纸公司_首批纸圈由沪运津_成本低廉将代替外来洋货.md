    Supplying the Needs of the North China Cigarette Industry!
    Shanghai Minfeng Huafeng Paper Mill
    First Batch of Paper Collars Shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin
    Low Cost Will Replace Foreign Goods
    [Shanghai News] Minfeng Huafeng Paper Mill, the largest paper mill in China, produces 140,000 bobbins of paper collars monthly, barely enough to supply the needs of the national cigarette industry. Before liberation, due to the shrinking sales in other regions, inventory piled up, and the mill was once on the verge of a complete shutdown. After liberation, in order to quickly expand business in the north, the company sent Xu Xingfu, Deputy Manager of the Business Department, to conduct on-the-ground inspections in Northeast China, North China, and Shandong around June 15th. He completed his mission and returned to Shanghai on July 15th. According to the inspection report, North China cigarette factories currently need approximately 40,000 bobbins of paper collars per month. Because Tianjin is open to foreign trade, foreign goods are widely used. It is estimated that after the company's products are shipped north, the selling price will be comparable to the local market price of foreign goods. Based on the current prices in North China, the market price of foreign paper collars is about 1.52 million yuan per box (6,000 meters). The current price of Minfeng paper collars is 700,000 yuan per box (4,000 meters) in this city, plus shipping costs of about 200,000 yuan, totaling about 1 million yuan. With the support of the People's Government, it is believed that after the paper collars are shipped north, there is a very good chance that they can replace foreign goods. The company has sent Xu Xingfu again on the 2nd of this month to go north to Shanghai to set up a Tianjin office and compete for the North China market.
    The first batch of Minfeng paper collars after liberation departed on August 1st, with one part loaded onto trains in Nanjing heading north to Jinan, and the other part loaded onto trains in Shanghai heading north to Tianjin. A total of 5,000 bobbins of paper collars were sent north to Jinan, which were ordered by the state-owned Shandong Tobacco Company. A total of twenty boxes of paper collars were shipped north to Tianjin as a trial shipment, using the "express self-handling" method, and also departed on the same day. According to Mr. Xu Xingfu, there are three types of railway freight cars: (1) full carload, (2) less-than-carload, and (3) express self-handling. The first two types are temporarily unavailable due to the limited number of freight cars. Currently, only the express self-handling method is available, limited to 100 kilograms per piece, and the shipper is responsible for loading, unloading, and escorting the goods. Each box of the company's paper collars originally contained 40 bobbins, weighing 134 kilograms. In order to meet the express self-handling requirements, it has been specially modified to weigh less than 100 kilograms per box. In addition to the land transportation that has officially started, the company has also sent personnel to investigate water transportation, tracing the canal north to Tianjin, but details have not yet been reported.

    供应华北卷烟业需要！
    沪民丰华丰造纸公司
    首批纸圈由沪运津
    成本低廉将代替外来洋货
    【上海讯】国内最大规模的民丰华丰造纸公司，月产纸圈十四万盘，勉能供应全国卷烟业的需要量，解放前由于外埠销路日狭，存货壅积，一度陷于全部停顿，解放后为迅速拓展北方业务，曾于六月十五日派该公司营业部副经理许兴馥前往东北、华北、山东一带实地考察于七月十五日完成任务返沪，据考察报告，华北各卷烟厂目前月需纸圈约四万盘，由于天津海口外通，采用洋货较多，估计该公司出品北运后售价约与当地洋货市价不相上下，根据最近华北目前价格，洋货纸圈每箱（六千米）市价约一百五十二万元，现民丰纸圈每箱（四千米）本市售价七十万元，加运费开支约二十余万元，共计约一百万元，在人民政府扶助下，相信纸圈北运后，有十分把握可以取代洋货之地位。该公司特再派许兴馥于本月二日离沪北上，筹设天津办事处，争取华北市场。
    解放后第一批民丰纸圈，八月一日一方面由南京装车北上济南，一方面由沪装车北运天津。北上济南的纸圈共五千盘，系公营山东烟草公司定货，北运天津的纸圈共二十箱，系试运性质，采取“快件自理”方式，亦于同日启运。据许兴馥氏谈称：陆运车皮分三种：（一）整车，（二）零担，（三）快件自理。前两种因车皮有限，暂无供给，现仅快件自理一种，限每件一百公斤以下，由货主自负装卸押运责任，该公司纸圈每箱原装四十盘，重一百三十四公斤，为适合快件自理起见，特改装为每箱一百公斤以下。该公司除陆运业已正式开始，且已派员调查水运，溯运河北上天津，详情尚未接获报告。
