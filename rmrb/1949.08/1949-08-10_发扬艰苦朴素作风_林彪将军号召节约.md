    Promote the Style of Hard Work and Plain Living
    General Lin Biao Calls for Thrift
    [This newspaper] Wuhan dispatch: The Central China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of senior cadres from directly subordinate organs of the Central China Bureau, Hubei Province, and Wuhan City on August 3rd. More than a thousand people attended. Lin Biao and Deng Zihui, Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the Central China Bureau, both emphasized in their reports at the meeting that the thrift and economy campaign being launched by the Central China Bureau throughout the region is essentially a party rectification and consolidation movement. They called on cadres at all levels to implement it with the spirit of the party rectification and consolidation movement. In order to carry out this movement, it is necessary to first open up the minds of senior cadres and launch the movement from top to bottom. At the same time, it is necessary to follow the mass line and mobilize the entire party and army to participate in this movement. Comrade Lin Biao further explained that the Central China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party proposed launching the thrift and economy campaign on the one hand based on actual needs, and on the other hand based on the possibility of streamlining organizations and reducing expenditures, because these are entirely possible to do. Finally, he pointed out that the current thrift and economy campaign should become a general mass movement and should be persisted in; responsible comrades of all organs should personally grasp the leadership, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and turn thrift and economy into a regular system. At the same time, it is necessary to promote our party's fine tradition of hard work and plain living.

    发扬艰苦朴素作风
    林彪将军号召节约
    【本报讯】武汉消息：中共中央华中局在八月三日召开华中局、湖北省和武汉市党政军各直属机关高级干部会议。出席一千多人。华中局正副书记林彪、邓子恢在会上报告华中局在全区展开精简节约运动的时候，都强调指出精简节约运动实质上就是一个整党整风运动，号召各级干部要以整党整风运动精神贯彻实行。为了开展这个运动，首先要打通高级干部思想，从上而下的把运动开展起来。同时要走群众路线，动员全党全军参加这个运动。林彪同志更说明中共中央华中局提出开展精简节约运动，一方面根据实际的需要，另一方面也是根据可能紧缩组织、减少开支，因为这都是完全可以做到的。最后指出目前的精简节约运动，要成为一般的群众性运动，并且要坚持下去；各机关负责同志要亲自掌握领导，开展批评与自我批评，使精简节约变成一种经常制度。同时要发扬我党坚苦朴素的优良作风。
