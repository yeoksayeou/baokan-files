The full text of the U.S. Information Service's dispatch recording the aforementioned key points of military intelligence is as follows:

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, August 24th] The following is a summary of a U.S. military intelligence report from July 1945 entitled "The Communist Movement in China," which was released here on August 20th by Representative Judd, a Republican Congressman from Minnesota. Mr. Judd criticized the State Department for neglecting this report. Secretary of State Acheson refuted these accusations at a press conference today. The following is a summary of the U.S. military report from 1945 released by the State Department today.

Almost every fair-minded observer in the United States has emphasized that the Chinese Communist Party is the most tightly organized, best-disciplined, most efficient, and most constructive group in China. This assertion is based on ample factual evidence. Their political and military skills, high degree of organization, and progressive attitude have earned them popular support in China, far surpassing that of any other Chinese political party. As a result, their sphere of influence has expanded continuously over the past seven years, and this expansion has now reached its peak. Many of the best-informed observers believe that no anti-communist group in China still harbors any hope of completely eliminating the Communist Party. Some particularly insightful observers have even made the bold prediction that if the reactionary group in Chongqing remains in power, the Chinese Communist Party will continue to thrive and ultimately prevail. The general trend at present is absolutely favorable to the development of the Communist Party. The prosperity and growth of the Communist Party's power in the past two years can be said to be the most significant development in China. This fact often leads some of our observers to question whether we are backing the wrong horse in China. From a strategic point of view, the United States could establish military cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party, as most of eastern China is under their political control, and establishing official relations with them is not out of the question. However, in light of the above points, it would be naive and impractical to deal with them only if we presuppose that they are not true communists (page 121).

In the years following the New Fourth Army Incident, the Chongqing government under the control of the Kuomintang gradually focused on preserving its military strength in order to strengthen its domestic position and confront the Communist Party. For this purpose, the Chongqing government gradually became unwilling to use its best troops to resist Japan. This situation became particularly evident after the United States entered the war. In the war zones of eastern China, the government never stopped confronting the Communist Party, and the burden of attacking the Communist Party gradually shifted to the shoulders of the Japanese army and the Chinese puppet government troops. Many Chongqing government troops (though few were regular central army troops) or Kuomintang troops even joined the puppet army and attacked the Communist Party with the support of the Japanese army. Before Japan launched an offensive in China in 1944, a de facto truce existed between the government forces and the Japanese and puppet forces in some battlefields for several years. Most of the government forces in Shandong and Jiangsu provinces retreated to the free areas of southern China and Anhui in 1940, leaving only a few guerrilla forces there. As a result, the coasts of North China provinces fell under the control of either the Communist Party or the Japanese army (page 225).

The various problems of the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the implied conflict of U.S. and Soviet policies, converge on one question: how can China establish a government acceptable to both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party? Another question is how the United States can exert its influence on the Communist Party to help China unite. The Chongqing government, as it is currently structured, is clearly a threat to Sino-Soviet friendship, strongly suspecting that the Soviet Union intends to rule China through the Communist Party. This view may be right or wrong. Private opinions on this issue are divided, but the record of past Sino-Soviet relations hardly proves that the Soviet Union has no intention of ruling China. Therefore, if the Chongqing government cannot reach a compromise with the Communist Party, and the National Government cannot represent the Chinese Communist Party and other parties, the Soviet Union will inevitably abandon the Chongqing government and support a Communist Party-controlled government in China, which is consistent with the Soviet Union's policies towards Poland and other Eastern European countries. At the same time, there is another fairly common view among observers: if there is no compromise between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, a large-scale civil war will occur in China after Japan's defeat, or even before Japan's defeat. The United States is clearly aware of the need for such a compromise. From this perspective, the unity of the various political parties in China is clearly the key to resolving the China problem (pages 237, 238, 239).

Supporting the Chongqing government with all our strength, without any conditions attached, will not solve the problem. The situation we are facing, which we must frankly acknowledge, is that the government we support in China, despite its greater military strength than any independent regime in China, has lost the support of most of the people. The Communist Party today poses a great challenge to the Kuomintang's rule, the most extensive challenge it has faced since the Kuomintang established the National Government in 1928. Mao Zedong recently commented to an American observer in Yan'an regarding the possibility of the Kuomintang launching a civil war against the Communist Party: "When our strength was a hundred times weaker than it is now, Chiang Kai-shek could not eliminate us in the civil war, let alone now." His words are undoubtedly correct. Recent armed conflicts between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have repeatedly shown that the Kuomintang forces are at a disadvantage. Because the people are turning to the Communist Party, not only are the people demonstrating this trend, but many middle-of-the-road parties are also showing a preference for cooperating with the Communist Party rather than with the Kuomintang. They are not members of the government party and are only nominally associated with the government because of their participation in the war against Japan. The corruption of the government administration and the unwillingness of government leaders to share power with other reputable party members have alienated all the political parties and groups that expressed their support for it at the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937. At the same time, many progressive and liberal leaders within the Kuomintang also strongly oppose the policies of the current ruling clique (page 246).

Any agreement or negotiation between the Chongqing government and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly strengthen China's unity and reduce the risk of the U.S. and the Soviet Union being drawn into the vortex of war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in China.

　　美帝军事情报要点
    纪录上述军事情报要点的美国新闻处电讯全文如下：
    【美国新闻处华盛顿二十四日电】下列为美国一九四五年七月一项名为中国的共产党运动的军事情报之摘要，该项摘要已由明尼苏达州共和党众议员楚德于八月二十日在此间发表。楚氏指摘国务院竟尔忽视此一报告。国务卿艾奇逊在今日记者招待会中，对于此种指摘加以反驳。下列为国务院今日公布之美国一九四五年军事报告之摘要。
    美国所有的公正观察家，几乎每一个都强调中国共产党在中国是政治组织最严密，纪律最良好，具有最强大效率及建设性之团体。此一论调有充分的事实根据。他们的政治和军事技巧，高度的组织力和进步的态度，使他们在中国获得群众的拥护，远非其他中国的政党所能匹敌。所以在过去七年，他们的势力范围日益扩张，现在这种势力的扩张已经登峰造极。很多消息最灵通的观察家，大都认为在中国没有一个反共的集团还抱有完全消灭共产党的希望。某些眼光特别的观察家竟作大胆的预见称：如果重庆反动集团继续当政，中国共产党的势力将蒸蒸日上，保持最后的优势。目前的一般趋势，是绝对地有利于共产党的发展。在过去两年中，共产党势力的繁荣滋长，可以说是中国最显著的发展。这种事实常常使我们若干的观察家们提出质问，我们是否在中国打鸭上架？从战略方面着想，美国大可与中国共产党成立军事合作关系，因为中国东部大部分的领土皆在他们的政治统治之下，和他们成立官方关系亦未为不可。但是由上述各点看来，如果我们预先假定他们不是真正的共产党，才和他们打交道，未免过于天真而不着实际了（第一二一页）。在新四军事件以后的几年内，国民党控制下的重庆政府，逐渐注意到保全其军事力量的问题，以便加强其在国内的地位而对抗共产党。由于这个目的，重庆政府便逐渐不愿以其最好的部队用于抵抗日本。自从美国参战以后，这种情形变得特别明显。在华东各战区内，政府从未停止对抗共产党，攻击共产党的负担并逐渐转移到日军和中国伪政府军队的肩上，许多重庆政府的军队（不过很少是正规的中央军）或者国民党的部队甚至参加伪军，在日军的支持下攻击共产党。在日本于一九四四年开始在中国发动攻势以前，在若干战场上，政府军和日军及伪军间事实上存在着一种休战状态达若干年之久。山东和江苏省的政府军大部分都于一九四○年撤退到华南与安徽的自由区，而仅留下少许游击部队在那里，结果华北各省的海岸，便分别陷入共产党或日军的控制下（第二二五页）。国共冲突的各种问题及其隐含的美苏政策冲突问题合在一个问题内，即中国怎样才能成立一个为国民党和中共双方都能接受的政府。另一个问题是美国如何才能对中共实施其影响力量，而有助于中国的团结。重庆政府一如现在的结构，显然对于中苏友谊会成为威胁的，它强力地怀疑着苏联欲经由中共而统治中国。这种看法也许是对的，也许是不对的。对于这个问题的私人意见很分歧，不过依照过去中苏关系的记载，殊不能证明苏联无意统治中国。因此，如果重庆政府不能与共产党实施妥协，而国民政府不能够代表中国共产党和其他党派，则苏联势将背弃重庆政府，而在中国支持一个共产党操纵的政府，这和苏联对波兰及其他东欧国家的政策是相合的。同时，观察家之间尚有另一个相当普遍的看法，即如果国共之间如无法妥协，则在日本失败后，甚至在日本失败以前，将会造成中国大规模的内战。美国对这种妥协有自觉是显而易见的。由于这种看法，中国各政党内的团结，显然便是中国问题获得解决的关键（二三七、二三八、二三九页）。以全力支持重庆政府，而不附带任何条件，是不能解决问题的。我们所正面临着的一个局面，是我们必须坦白承认的，即我们在中国所支持的一个政府，尽管其军事力量较中国的任何独立政权为强，然而它已失去了大部分人民的支持。中共今天对国民党的统治造成一个极大的挑衅，自从国民党于一九二八年成立国民政府以来，从来没有遭遇到这广大的挑衅。毛泽东最近对一个在延安的美国观察家评论国民党可能发动一个对抗共产党的内战一事说：我们的力量比现在弱一百倍的时候，蒋介石尚不能在内战中消灭我们，何况现在。他的话无疑是对的。从最近国共间的武装冲突看起来，一再说明国民党的部队居于下风。因为人民都投向共产党一方面，不仅人民表示出来这种趋势，而且许多中间党派也表示出宁愿与共产党合作，而不愿与国民党合作的趋势。他们不是政府党的分子，而仅因为参加对日战争才和政府在名义上联系在一起的。政府行政的腐败，政府领袖的不愿与其他信誉卓著的党员分享政权，疏远了所有在一九三七年中日战争爆发时对其表示拥护的政治党派和团体。同时国民党内还有许多进步的和自由主义的领袖，也强烈的反对现行统治集团的政策（第二四六页）。重庆政府和苏联间的任何协议或论调，无疑都可加强中国的团结，并减少美苏卷入中国国共两党战争漩涡的危机。
