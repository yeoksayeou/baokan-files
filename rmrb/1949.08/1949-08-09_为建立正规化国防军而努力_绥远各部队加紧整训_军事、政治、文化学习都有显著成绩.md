    [Suiyuan Electric Dispatch] To further move towards regularization and establish a strong national defense army, the People's Liberation Army units under the Suiyuan Military Region are currently intensifying training. The "Xinmin Department," in commemoration of the "August 1st" Army Day and the department's one-year anniversary of being promoted from a local army to a field army, held military and cultural tests for cadres before "August 1st," proving that significant achievements have been made after training. The first battalion of the "08" Department achieved an average grenade throwing distance of 40.6 meters, with the highest record being 56.8 meters. In the "07" Department's rifle live-fire shooting (distance of 100 meters, targeting the bullseye), the average hit rate was over 98%, with four companies achieving 100% accuracy and no misses, and five sharpshooters creating a record of three shots, three hits, and thirty rings. Among them, liberation fighter Zhu Fu from the Sixth Company, who couldn't hit the target when he served in the bandit army in Datong, now scored three shots for thirty rings and is known as a glorious sharpshooter. During the Party class test, the leadership prepared five relatively difficult but practical questions, such as: "What are the requirements for joining the Party?" "What are the differences in rights and obligations between formal members and probationary members?" "What are the advantages and disadvantages of the branch life system in this company?" "Who are the members of the branch committee?" A total of 385 people were randomly tested, most of whom were soldier Party members. The test results showed that 95 people answered all questions correctly. A total of 889 soldiers participated in the random test (who were illiterate or at most knew 30 to 50 characters in the past), and 71 of them could recite more than 300 new characters, and the least could recite more than 100 characters. Xiao Sanyuan, a feeder at the supply department, and Li Maodan, a communication soldier, were illiterate two months ago, but now they can recite all 50 lessons of the cultural textbook compiled and printed by the department. Other tests, such as tactics, politics, and discipline, also showed great results. At the test summary meeting, units and individuals with excellent results were given material (banners) and spiritual rewards. This training movement is still continuing.

    While testing, the units also conducted discipline inspections, with the Seventh Company of the "08" unit being the best. In this company, no kang (platform bed) in any squad was covered with villagers' mats. Soldiers used ash to plaster the kang skin, and there were no nails on the walls. The courtyard was swept once a day, and the streets were swept twice. From June to August this year, the whole company helped the landlord carry an average of six loads of water per day. Once, when the company kitchen borrowed the villager's bucket, the villager came to ask for it, saying, "My house has no water." The cooks immediately carried three or four loads of water for them. They often carried a few loads of water for the family whose bucket they borrowed. On July 26th, the company commander took a few soldiers and, during their rest time, plastered ten and a half rooms for the company headquarters' landlord, Shi Qianjin. Sometimes, if they borrowed villagers' basins, bowls, chopsticks, etc., and damaged them, they would immediately compensate them at the original price. The masses reacted very well, and some people said: "The Liberation Army can win battles because it can gain the support of the people."

    为建立正规化国防军而努力
    绥远各部队加紧整训
    军事、政治、文化学习都有显著成绩
    【绥远电】为进一步走向正规化，建立强有力的国防军，绥远军区所属各部人民解放军，近正加紧进行整训。“新民部”为了纪念“八一”建军节及该部由地方军荣升为野战军一周年，特于“八一”前举行了干部军事、文化等测验，证明经过整训后已经获得显著成绩。“零八”部第一营全营投弹平均四十米六，最高纪录为五十六米八。“零七”部步枪实弹射击（距离一百米，一米达环靶）平均命中率在百分之九十八以上，有四个连全部百发百中，无一脱靶，并创造了三发三中三十环的神枪手五名。其中六连解放战士朱富，在大同随匪军当兵时，打靶不上环，现在他三枪三十环，被称为光荣的神枪手。党课测验时，领导上拟出了五个较难答而又实际的题目，如：“什么是入党条件？”“正式党员与候补党员的区别及其权利、义务？”“本连支部生活制度上的优缺点”，“支委会由哪些人组成？”等共抽测了三百八十五人，其中绝大部分是战士党员，测验结果，全部答对的有九十五人。参加抽测的战士共八百八十九人（过去都是文盲或至多识三五十个字），有七十一人能默写出三百多个生字，最少的也在一百个字以上。供给处饲养员肖三元、通讯员李毛旦，在两个月以前还是文盲，现在能将该部编印的五十课的文化课本全部默写出来。其它如战术、政治、纪律等测验，都有很大成绩。在测验总结大会上，分别对成绩优良的单位和个人给以物质（锦旗）和精神奖励。这种整训运动，现仍在继续进行中。
    各部队于测验同时，并进行了纪律检查，其中以“零八”部队七连为最好。该连各班炕上都不铺老乡的席子，战士们用灰抹了炕皮，墙上没钉一个钉子，每天扫院子一次，扫街道两次。从今年六月到八月，全连平均每天帮助房东担六担水。有一次连部伙房借了老乡的水桶，老乡来要时说：“我家没水了”。炊事员同志马上给担了三四担水。他们经常是借那家的水桶，就先给那家担几担水。七月二十六日，连长带了几个战士，在休息时间，给连部房东史千金抹了十间半房子。有时借老乡的盆子、碗、筷等，如有损坏，立即照价赔偿。群众反映很好，有的人说：“解放军能打胜仗，就因为他能得到老百姓的拥护”。
