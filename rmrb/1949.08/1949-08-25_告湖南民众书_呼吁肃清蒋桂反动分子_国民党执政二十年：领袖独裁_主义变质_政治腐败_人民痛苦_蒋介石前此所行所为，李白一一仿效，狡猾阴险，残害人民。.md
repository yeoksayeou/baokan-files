    Cheng Qian also issued a letter to the people of Hunan on August 4th. The letter stated:

    "Nationalism is aimed at imperialism. Overthrowing imperialism is the realization of nationalism. Looking at the Nanjing government's diplomacy in the past ten years, it has always wagged its tail and begged for mercy from imperialism, or even colluded with it for evil. Now, as its days are numbered, it is still fantasizing about the imminent outbreak of a third world war, so it can serve imperialism like a dog. Democracy is aimed at autocracy and dictatorship. After Sun Yat-sen's death, the party was entirely under the dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek. A group of incompetent and shameless party hacks flattered and accommodated themselves to him, controlling party affairs. Loyal party members were all excluded. The party headquarters became like a government office, and party officials filled the cities. Party members were already disconnected from the masses, let alone the common people? There was no democracy within the party, let alone the government? Furthermore, they were obsessed with fascism, imitating it closely. The military intelligence and central intelligence agencies, with their special agents everywhere, killed people like flies, with extreme cruelty and viciousness, embodying the essence of Cao Cao, Zhu Yuanzhang, Hitler, and Mussolini. There was no freedom of speech, publication, assembly, or association. People were wary on the streets, and who wouldn't be chilled to the bone? Restricting capital and equalizing land ownership are the two major basic policies of the Principle of People's Livelihood. Their purpose is to rationalize the social production and distribution relations and gradually eliminate the exploiting and exploited classes. But under the protection of the Chiang regime, those with nepotistic relationships, those who controlled the party, those who controlled the army, those who carved out local territories, and those who managed finance and banking—this group of poor wretches, within a few years, all had fields stretching for miles and were richer than entire countries. Capital was concentrated, powerful families emerged, the people became emaciated, and the Principle of People's Livelihood was shelved. The Three Principles of the People we believe in are revolutionary; they are anti-imperialist, anti-feudal forces, and anti-bureaucratic capital. But the government's actions are completely contrary to these principles. Shouldn't this kind of 'selling dog meat under the guise of mutton' shop be banned? Is it still worth our shedding blood and sweat to maintain and support it? In all countries, ancient and modern, there is no such thing as a regime permanently controlled by a certain party or a certain group. As the saying goes, 'There is an order to the four seasons, and those who succeed must retreat.' Those who are successful still need to retreat, and those who are unsuccessful should retreat early and quickly, allowing virtuous and capable people to serve the people well. The Kuomintang has been in power for more than twenty years, with the leader's dictatorship, the doctrine degenerated, political corruption, and the people suffering. The old feudal consciousness has not been eliminated, and new feudal forces have risen. After fleeing from Nanjing to Guangzhou, it became even more of a mess. The legal tender has already harmed people enough, and last year they used gold yuan to deceive the people, plundering hundreds of millions of taels of gold and silver from the people, secretly transporting them to Taiwan to provide funds for the Four Big Families and their lackeys to squander and escape. The number of people bankrupted by the gold yuan is countless. The government doesn't want the people or the army, only cultivating those direct line troops as hawks and dogs, ignoring everything else. Six hundred thousand troops are stationed within Hunan, and they have not been openly paid for months. Even military rations are forcibly seized and borrowed from the people, causing cries of sorrow and resentment to fill the air. Such an irresponsible and helpless government still wants to force the people to go to the grave with them. The White bandit Chongxi clamors for Hunan to be 'cleared of people and property,' isn't this forcing thirty million people to die? He is insane and harmful, more vicious than Huang Chao and Zhang Xianzhong. Here, we supplement an explanation of the peace movement, so that everyone understands that Bai Chongxi's behavior is that of a standard petty person, a thorough warlord, and an utterly selfish person who has absolutely no principles or credibility. After the Huaihai Campaign, Chiang Kai-shek's main force was annihilated. At that time, Bai Chongxi held heavy troops, occupying Hubei and Anhui provinces. Not only did he not go to rescue, but he also took the opportunity to seize power, forcing Chiang Kai-shek to step down, so that Li Zongren could become president. We understand that Li and Bai are not to be trusted, but since they are calling for peace, we have no reason to oppose peace. Moreover, peace is the unanimous wish of the entire people of Hunan. Therefore, when Li and Bai called for peace, we supported them first, regardless of their motives. All sectors of the province have enthusiastically voiced their calls for a ceasefire and peace talks. This is truly the public will of the people, the dictates of conscience, and is not being exploited by others or for one's own ulterior motives. We are honest, but who knows that Li and Bai are cunning and suspicious. The reason they advocated peace at that time was just to use peace to overthrow Chiang. After Chiang Kai-shek fell and Li Zongren came to power, peace talk representatives were sent, and the peace terms were negotiated. Suddenly, they changed their attitude, refused to sign, and loudly beat the drums of war, harping on the old tune of total war. Everything that Chiang Kai-shek had done before, such as colluding with imperialism, oppressing the people, excluding dissidents, plundering money, forming factions for personal gain, being anti-communist and flattering foreigners, etc., Li and Bai imitated exactly, vividly, even surpassing him. From advocating peace to advocating war, Li and Bai are the main actors. Turning their hands into clouds and raining down, they have exhausted all the ugly acts of cunning, treachery, insidiousness, and deception in the world. The fundamental error lies in selfishness and self-interest. They thought that advocating peace could win the sympathy of all parties and seize power, and advocating war could cater to the psychology of Taiwan, trick them into giving them gold, silver, and foreign exchange, and even kidnap the local people and plunder their wealth. Bai Chongxi, in Wuhan, under the name of anti-communism and preparing for war, extorted gold, silver, and materials worth 1 billion. More than a thousand trains transported the looted materials to Guangxi, and tens of thousands of tons were still parked along the way waiting to be transported. After sucking the lifeblood of Hubei dry, he immediately turned his blade to Hunan. Mistaking Hunan for a fat pig, he wanted to open his bloody mouth and indulge his gluttony. That ferocious and greedy appearance made people want to vomit. In order to take the overall situation into account and implement moral education, I tolerated him as much as possible and did not argue with him, hoping that he would have a day of awakening. Therefore, since April of this year, I have kept my mouth shut and not said a word. Occasionally, I have offered perfunctory words of response, just trying to remain calm and defuse the situation. Now, the People's Liberation Army is marching south in force, and Bai Chongxi is fleeing in panic. The Guangxi army he leads is disrupting southern Hunan, while forcing the Hunan army to fight on the front lines. When there is nothing to do, he takes all the benefits for himself, and when there is trouble, he passes all the suffering on to others. We Hunan people have always rushed to justice, fearing to be left behind, and we will never evade our obligations. But the distinction between righteousness and unrighteousness must be clearly recognized. Helping the remaining feudal forces and maintaining the power of the corrupt clique is the most unrighteous thing. Conversely, uniting the people's forces and liberating the people from their suffering is the greatest righteousness. I have given the Guangzhou government and Bai Chongxi and others the greatest tolerance and the final advice, urging them to quickly lay down their butcher knives, immediately cease fighting and negotiate peace, and never again use the people as a gamble. But they are stubborn and determined to perish together. In fact, their families and property have long been deposited abroad. The suffering of the war's failure will still be borne by our working masses. It is our place that is being devastated, our flesh and blood that are being killed and wounded. They are watching the fire from across the river, unconcerned. After a long period of review and research, we have reached this conclusion:

    Break away from the Guangzhou government;
    Expel Bai Chongxi;
    Workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and the petty bourgeoisie unite and act in unison;
    Establish a truly people's democratic government.

    Now, according to the domestic peace terms suggested by the Chinese Communist Party, we have reached a peace agreement in Changsha and formally announced our separation from the Guangzhou government, so that Hunan can achieve peaceful liberation, thereby alleviating the people's suffering and avoiding local devastation. Everyone has always demanded peace, and now that peace has arrived, everyone should applaud and welcome it. Within Hunan, the Guangxi army and certain reactionary elements of the Chiang Kai-shek line are still obstacles to peace. Everyone must rise up to eliminate them. Then, extend peace to the southwest and northwest, so that the whole country can quickly achieve peace, forever eliminate civil war, and under the leadership of the new democratic government, work in a down-to-earth manner and engage in new democratic construction, thoroughly realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideal of the Principle of People's Livelihood, and establish a unified, prosperous, strong, and happy new China."　　Cheng Qian　August 4th.

　　告湖南民众书
  　呼吁肃清蒋桂反动分子
    国民党执政二十年：领袖独裁
  　主义变质
  　政治腐败
  　人民痛苦
    蒋介石前此所行所为，李白一一仿效，狡猾阴险，残害人民。
    程氏又于八月四日发表告湖南民众书。该书略称：
    “民族主义是以帝国主义为对象的。打倒帝国主义，才是民族主义的实现。试看南京政府近十年的外交，无时不向帝国主义摇尾乞怜，或竟勾结为恶。到今日日暮途穷，还在幻想第三次世界大战即将爆发，好为帝国主义效犬马之劳。民权主义是针对专制独裁的。总理逝世以后，党内全由蒋介石独裁。一流无能无耻的党棍子，阿谀取容，把持党务。忠实党员，尽被排斥。党部化为衙门，党官充塞城市。党员尚且脱节，何况民众？党内尚不民主，何况政府？又复醉心于法西斯，揣摩酷肖。军统中统，特工遍布，杀人如麻，残忍毒辣，集曹操、朱元璋、希特勒、莫索里尼之大成。言论出版，集会结社，绝无自由。道路侧目，谁不寒心。节制资本，平均地权，为民生主义的两大基本政策，其目的是要使社会的生产和分配关系能够合理化，逐渐消除剥削阶级与被剥削阶级。但在蒋政权卵翼之下，有裙带关系的，把持党内的，掌握军队的，割据地方的，管理财政金融的，这一群穷小子，几年之间，莫不田连阡陌，富可敌国。资本集中了，豪门出现了，人民枯瘦了，民生主义束之高阁了。我们信仰革命的三民主义，就是反帝国主义，反封建势力，反官僚资本的。但政府所行所为，完全与主义背道而驰。这种挂羊头卖狗肉的铺子，还不应该取缔吗？还值得我们流血流汗去维持他，拥护他吗？古今中外各国的政权，没有永久操在某一党派，某一集团的道理。所谓“四时之序，成功者退”。成功的尚且有退去之必要，不成功的，更应该早退快退，让贤者能者为人民好好服务。国民党执政二十多年，领袖独裁，主义变质，政治腐败，人民痛苦。旧的封建意识未除，新的封建势力抬头。从南京流亡广州以后，更其不成东西，法币害人已够了，去年又以金圆券欺骗人民，搜刮民间黄金白银几万万两，秘密运到台湾，以供四大家族及其奴才挥霍逃亡之资。人民因金圆券而破产者比比皆是。政府既不要人民，也不要军队，只培植作为鹰犬的那些嫡系部队，其他一概不管。湖南境内驻扎六十万军队，最近数月从不公开发饷，连军粮都向人民强抢强借，弄得哭声动地，怨气冲天。这样不负责任，毫无办法的政府，还要压迫人民一齐跟他们走向墓里去。白匪崇禧口口声声要湖南空室清野，这不是要迫使三千万人死光吗？丧心害理，比黄巢张献忠还要毒辣。这里，我们补充说明和平运动的经过，使得大家明了白崇禧的作风是一个标准小人，道地军阀，澈底的自私自利者，绝对没有主义和信用的。徐蚌会战以后，蒋介石的主力消灭了。那时候白崇禧手握重兵，盘据湖北安徽两省，不但不去救援，并且乘机夺取政权，逼迫蒋介石退位，好让李宗仁来作总统。我们明了李白是不可信赖的，但他们既以和平相号召，我们没有理由可以反对和平。况且和平是我们湖南人民全体一致的愿望。所以李白呼吁和平，我们不问他们的动机怎样，首先起来赞成。全省各界，莫不很热烈的发出停战讲和的呼声。这实在是人民的公意，良心的主张，并不是被人利用或自己别有意图。我们是老老实实的，谁知道李白却是鬼鬼祟祟的。他们那时所以主和，不过要借和平以倒蒋。蒋介石倒了，李宗仁上台了，和谈代表派去了，和平条件商量好了，忽然转变态度，拒绝签字，并且大擂战鼓，大弹总体战之旧调。凡是蒋介石前此所行所为，如勾结帝国主义，压迫人民，排除异己，搜括金钱，植党营私，反共媚外等等，李白一一仿效，惟妙惟肖，甚至青出于蓝，更有过之。由主和以至主战，李白都是主角。翻手成云，覆手成雨，极尽人间狡猾变诈阴险欺骗之丑。根本错误，在于自私自利，他们以为主和可以取得各方之同情，夺取政权，主战又可以迎合台湾的心理，骗取金银外汇，更可以劫持地方人民，搜括财物。白崇禧在武汉以反共备战之名，榨取金银及物资价值十亿。所劫物资，运往广西的达千余列车，沿途停放待运的，还有几万吨。湖北的膏血吸尽了，立即转其刀锋于湖南。误把湖南看做肥猪，又欲张其血口，逞其饕餮。那一副狰狞贪馋的样子，使人见之欲呕。我为顾全大体，施行感化教育起见，尽量容忍，不与计较，希望他有觉悟的一天。所以自从今年四月以后，我就缄口结舌，未发一言，偶有应酬敷衍之词，无非力持镇静，以消戈矛。现在解放军大举南下，白崇禧狼狈逃窜。他所率广西军队窜扰湘南，而胁迫湘军在前线作战。无事则利权尽以施己，有事则苦难尽以付人。我们湖南人向来赴义恐后，决不规避义务。但义与不义之分，必须认识清楚。帮助残余封建，维持贪污集团的政权，那是最不义的。反之，联合人民的武力，解放人民于水深火热之中，那才是大仁大义。我对于广州政府及白崇禧等，已经尽了最大的容忍，进了最后的忠告，劝戒他们赶快放下屠刀，立即停战议和，切勿再以人民作为赌注。可是他们执迷不悟，定要同归于尽。其实他们的家小财产，早已寄顿在外国，战争失败的痛苦，受之者还是我们劳苦大众，糜烂的是我们的地方，死伤的是我们的骨肉，他们隔岸观火，无关痛痒。经大家长期检讨研究，我们得到这个结论：
    脱离广州政府；
    驱逐白崇禧；
    农工兵学和小资产阶级联合起来一致行动；
    另建真正人民的民主政府。
    现在我们已经根据中共提示的国内和平条款，在长沙成立和平协议，正式宣布脱离广州政府，使湖南获得和平的解放，借以减轻人民痛苦，避免地方糜烂。大家一向要求和平，现在和平到了，大家应当拍掌欢迎。在湖南境内，桂系军队和蒋介石路线的某些反动分子，仍是和平的障碍，大家要起来肃清他。然后再把和平引向西南和西北，使全国迅速实现和平，永远根绝内战，一致在新的民主政府领导之下，脚踏实地，从事新民主主义建设，把总理孙中山先生的民生主义理想彻底实现，建立一个统一富强康乐的新中国。　　程潜　八月四日。
