　　Youth Academy Concludes
　　Sports Meet Filled with New Atmosphere
　　Overflowing with Collective Spirit, Unity and Friendship
　　Eight Hundred Students Hold Joining Ceremony
　　[Our Newspaper] The Beijing Summer Youth Academy concluded yesterday. A grand graduation ceremony was held at the Huiven Middle School sports field, and eight hundred and eighty-one new members who were newly approved to join the League in the academy held a joining ceremony. After the ceremony, a sports meet was held. More than four thousand students from the academy participated after being divided into teams by district. At the graduation ceremony, Du Ping, Deputy Director of the Academy, reported on the 36-day work and achievements of the Academy. He said that the students' thinking has progressed compared to when they entered the academy: After the lectures on labor creating the world and the five modes of production, and half-day labor, they realized that the creators of the world are the working people, understood the laws of social development, and then knew that they should stand on the side of the working people to look at problems; after listening to "Individual and Collective," they realized that only when collective freedom is guaranteed and developed can individual freedom have a way out; through the introduction of the Youth League, the students recognized the League, recognized the organization, and therefore many students requested to join the League. After speeches by Gao Tang, member of the Central Committee of the Youth League, Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu, and Xu Liqun, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Youth League, Xiao Song, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, reported on the preparations, emphasizing that the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association depends on the strength of workers and students.

　　[Another News Item] The Youth Academy Sports Meet began at 11 o'clock with a march-in ceremony. The military band of the Military and Political University walked in front, followed by several large red flags waving around the giant portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. As they passed the rostrum, everyone applauded enthusiastically. The waist drum team followed closely behind, and then the athletes from each district strode forward with their chests held high.
　　The performance began, the first program was a group exercise of one thousand six hundred people. The highlight was the "National Liberation" section of the exercise. Everyone raised their hands high, and the majestic sound of "National Liberation" resounded through the sky, demonstrating the power of youth united.
　　Everyone was very interested in the glider performance. This was a model airplane made by students in the Northwest District with the help of the Department of Engineering of Peking University. A group of red, blue, white, large, and small gliders with rods and fuselages took off, some circling in the air for a long time, some swooping to the ground and flying into the sky again, and some somersaulting in the air. This reminded people of the Air Force Day held in Moscow not long ago. In the near future, we will see a strong people's air force. Looking up at this symbol of the new China's scientific construction, everyone was excitedly speechless.
　　The relay race with changes is a performance that has never been seen at previous sports meets. Here, the men's 800-meter exchange relay race performed the process of the Chinese Liberation War. One section was where each person carried a burden weighing forty pounds, representing the obstacles and difficulties encountered in the early stages of the war; two people ran while carrying a wooden box, representing the people's enthusiastic support for the front; jumping over hurdles represented the People's Liberation Army crossing the Yangtze River; and finally reaching the destination—liberating all of China. Such a meaningful performance, connected with politics, attracted thousands of eyes, nervously following their every move.
　　Like the Yangko dance of the Central District, dressed as workers, peasants, and peasant women, and the Yangko dance of the Southwest District, wearing gray pants and red shirts, the waist drum dance of the Central District, which had only been formally practiced for two days, also won applause from the audience. Dressed in farmers' clothing, with red and green ribbons fluttering, their neat, powerful, healthy, and joyful steps made people feel how vibrant the youth of the new China are.
　　The sports meet also included tug-of-war, gymnastics, five-star race, Yue Ren race, singing competition, group dance, etc., all of which showed a clear collective spirit, and brought into play the power of mutual assistance and unity; and everyone consciously maintained order, reversing the past phenomena of noise, fighting, and arguing over scores in sports fields. Some teams, even though they lost, were not discouraged or complained, and showed the same excitement for the victory of others. (Ji Qing)

　　青年学园昨结业
  　运动会充满新气象
  　洋溢集体精神团结友爱
    八百同学举行入团仪式
    【本报讯】北平市暑期青年学园昨天结束，在汇文中学运动场举行了盛大的结业典礼，并有八百八十一个在学园中新批准入团的团员举行入团式，会后并举行运动大会。四千多位学园同学分区整队来参加。结业典礼中学园副主任杜平同志报告学园三十六天的工作情况和收获。他说，同学们的思想较之入园时已有进步：经过劳动创造世界和五种生产方式的讲座和半日劳动，认识了世界的创造者是劳动人民，知道了社会发展的规律，继而知道了应该站在劳动人民的立场看问题了；听过了“个人与集体”，认识了要集体自由有了保障与发展，个人自由才有出路；通过青年团的介绍，使同学认识了团，认识了组织，因而有许多同学要求入团。在青年团中央委员高棠同志、张友渔副市长、青年团市筹委会主任许立群同志相继讲话之后，中苏友好协会平市分会筹备会秘书长萧松报告了筹备经过，着重指出中苏友好协会的成立要靠工人和学生的力量。（学园宣传部）
    【又讯】青年学园运动大会，十一时开始行入场式，军大文工团的乐队走在前面，接着是高举着的几面大红旗，招展在毛主席、朱总司令的巨像周围，走过主席台前，大家热烈地鼓掌，腰鼓队紧接在后面，接着是各区的健儿们挺着胸膛走向前去。
    表演开始，第一个节目是一千六百人的团体操。精彩的是“全国解放”一节操，大家双手高举，“全国解放”的雄伟声音响澈高空，显示着青年团结起来的力量。
    大家对滑翔机表演感到很大的兴趣。这是西北区同学在北大工学院的帮助下自制的飞机模型。一群红色的、蓝色的、白色的、大的、小的杆身及舱身滑翔机，腾空而起，有的在空中盘旋良久，有的向地上俯冲又飞上天空，有的在空中翻筋斗。这使人们想起不久在莫斯科举行的空军节，在不久将来，我们将会看到强大的人民空军队伍。仰望着这新中国科学建设的象征，大家兴奋的闭不住口。
    变换接力赛是以往运动会上从未表演过的。在这里，男子八百米交换接力赛跑，表演了中国解放战争的过程。有一段是每人挑起四十斤重的担子，表示战争初期经过的障碍与困难；有两人边跑边抬着木箱，表示人民热烈支前；跳栏表示解放军渡过长江；于是最后达到目的地——解放全中国。这样一个和政治联系，有意义的表演，吸引着千百双眼睛，紧张地跟随着他们的一举一动而转动。
    和化装成工人、农民、农妇的中心区大秧歌、穿着灰裤红衬衣的西南区大秧歌一样，博得全场一片掌声的还有正式练习仅两天的中心区腰鼓，他们身穿农民农妇衣服，飘着红绿彩绸，整齐、有力、健康、愉快的步伐，使人感到新中国的青年是多么生气勃勃。
    运动会中并有拔河、器械体操、五星赛跑、越人赛跑、歌咏比赛、集体舞等，都表现了鲜明的集体精神，发挥着互助团结的力量；而且大家自觉地维持了秩序，一反过去体育场上吵闹打架争分数等的现象。有的队虽然输了，不但不气馁或抱怨，而且对别人的胜利，表现了同样的兴奋。　　　　　　　（纪清）
