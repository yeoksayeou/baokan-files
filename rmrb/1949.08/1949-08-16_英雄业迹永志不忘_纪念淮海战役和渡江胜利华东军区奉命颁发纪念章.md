Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station, August 15th: The East China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, acting on an order from the Central Military Commission, is issuing "Huaihai Campaign" and "Victory of Crossing the Yangtze River" commemorative medals, starting August 1st. The first recipients will be all personnel of the field armies who are departing or are about to depart on campaigns. The East China Military Region, the Headquarters and Political Department of the Third Field Army, have announced decisions regarding the issuance of the two commemorative medals.

Additionally: The "People's Front," the organ of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, published a short commentary in its fifth issue entitled "Record of the People's Victory," in connection with the issuance of the Huaihai Campaign and Crossing the Yangtze River commemorative medals. It stated: The victory of the Huaihai Campaign and the Crossing the Yangtze River not only laid the foundation for the national victory, but also made a great contribution to the cause of peace and democracy for the people of the world. When each person receiving the commemorative medal wears it, they will surely recall the heroic images of fighting tenaciously and working hard on the vast Huaihai Plain, crossing rivers and wading through water, enduring hunger and cold; they will surely recall the urgent mood of practicing day and night, preparing to cross the Yangtze River, and the sound of ten thousand ships setting off together at the time of crossing the river, riding the wind and waves, with the sound of cannons and bugles resounding together. They will inevitably feel honored by recalling these heroic deeds, and further increase their heroic spirit and fighting will. At the same time, every person wearing the commemorative medal will inevitably recognize that the attainment of these great victories is primarily due to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the wise command of Commander-in-Chief Zhu; at the same time, it was obtained with the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people; it is inseparable from the coordinated operations of various fraternal units on the national battlefields, especially the close coordinated operations of the Second and Third Field Armies on the same battlefield, and we must firmly remember this. More importantly, when you wear the victory medal, you should remember that our past victories are great, but our future cause is boundless. Do not be complacent because of past victories, but should make persistent efforts, carry forward the past style of humbly learning, working hard, and fighting tenaciously, and create more and greater heroic achievements in the march towards South China and Southwest China, and in the future construction work, and write more glorious and greater records.

    【上海人民广播电台十五日广播】中国人民解放军华东军区，奉中央军委电令颁发的“淮海战役”和“渡江胜利”两纪念章，自八月一日开始陆续颁发，首先颁发者，为在出征或即将出征的野战军全体人员，华东军区，第三野战军司令部、政治部，已公布关于两项纪念章颁发的决定。
    【又讯】中国人民解放军华东军区及第三野战军机关报“人民前线”第五期，为奉令颁发淮海战役和渡江作战两种纪念章，特以“人民胜利的纪录”为题，发表短论称：淮海战役和渡江作战的胜利，不但奠定了全国胜利的基础，并且对全世界人民和平民主事业作了极大的供献。每一个领受到纪念章的人员，当他们佩带起纪念章的时候，必然会怀想起：在广漠地淮海平原上，渡河涉水，忍饥耐寒，顽强作战，艰苦工作的英雄图画；必然会怀想起：在天险长江边上，日夜演习，装束待命的迫切心情，以及渡江之时，万船齐发，乘风破浪，炮声与号声齐鸣；也必然因为怀想起这些英勇烈迹而引为光荣，更增长其英勇气派与奋斗意志，同时，每一个佩带纪念章的人员，也必然会认识到，这些伟大胜利的获得，首先是由于中国共产党中央毛主席的正确领导，和朱总司令的英明指挥；同时，是以广大的人民的热烈支持而得来的；是以全国各战场各兄弟部队的协同作战，特别是第二第三两大野战军，在同一战场上的密切协同作战分不开的，这一点我们一定牢牢记着。更要紧的，当你们佩带起胜利纪念章的时候，更应该紧紧记着：我们过去的胜利虽然是伟大的，但我们未来的事业更是无疆的。不要因为过去的胜利而自骄，应该再接再厉，发扬过去虚心学习、艰苦奋斗、顽强作战的作风，在向华南和向西南的进军中，在今后建设的工作中，更要创造出更多更大的英雄业迹，写下更光荣更伟大的纪录来。
