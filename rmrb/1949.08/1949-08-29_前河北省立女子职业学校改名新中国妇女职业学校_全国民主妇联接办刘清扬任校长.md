　　Former Hebei Provincial Women's Vocational School Renamed New China Women's Vocational School
    All-China Democratic Women's Federation Takes Over, Liu Qingyang Appointed Principal
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Beiping City's Hebei Provincial Women's Vocational School was taken over by the All-China Democratic Women's Federation on the 15th of this month. The school's administration is led by the North China Higher Education Commission, while the All-China Women's Federation leads its operations. It has now been renamed the New China Women's Vocational School, and Liu Qingyang has been appointed as Principal, Tian Xiujuan and Chu Shu as Vice-Principals, Huang Menggu as Director of Teaching Affairs, and Wu Jing as Director of General Affairs. It has also been decided to divide the existing four hundred-plus students into eight classes: three classes in Commerce, one class in Sewing, three classes in Rural Teacher Training, and one class in Cultural Remedial Studies. In addition to studying politics and culture, each department will spend half or more of its time on professional studies, emphasizing integration with practice. For example, the Commerce department, after studying accounting, economics, cooperatives, industrial and commercial organization and management, will intern in the school's cooperative; the Sewing department will combine with production, contracting to make clothing and children's toys for the organs' nurseries, becoming an internship factory; the Rural Teacher Training department, in addition to studying the courses required for elementary school teaching, will also study teaching methods, rural services, and maternal and child health, and will intern in the city's children's literacy classes; the Cultural Remedial Studies class is established for students with lower levels of education, and after improving their cultural level, they will transfer to other departments. The duration of study for each of the above departments is set at one year. The school is now preparing to open in early September.
