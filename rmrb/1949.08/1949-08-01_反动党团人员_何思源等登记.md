    Reactionary Party Members
    He Siyuan and Others Register
    [This City News] Since the Beiping Military Control Commission issued a notice on July 23rd for the registration of reactionary parties such as the Kuomintang, the Three People's Principles Youth League, the Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party, requiring personnel at the district department, district branch, and squad leader level and above to register, members of various reactionary parties have been registering one after another in recent days. Yesterday, He Siyuan, former Kuomintang puppet mayor of Beiping, chairman of Shandong Province, and member of the Shandong Provincial Party Department; Wang Zhihai, executive member and director of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party; Shen Yun, executive member of the Beiping Municipal Committee; Lin Shufan (female), supervisory member of the Beiping Municipal Committee; and Li Fen, executive member of the Kuomintang Shanxi Provincial Party Department, and many others went to various registration offices to complete registration procedures and handed over relevant documents and certificates. All factories, mines, railways, cultural organizations, public enterprises, and government agencies in Beiping Municipality have not only established registration offices and registration groups, but also actively launched mass anti-espionage and anti-special agent work. Each section and station of the Pingjin Railway Bureau's Beiping area has established registration groups for reactionary party members. So far, more than 20 people have registered in the Qianmen District, and 30 people have registered in the Fengtai District. The Beiping Postal Administration Bureau and the Beiping Branch of the North China Electric Power Company have not only posted notices and announcements for the registration of reactionary party members, but have also held mobilization meetings, using big-character posters and blackboards for publicity and mobilization. The Water Company has also launched study movements in various employee groups, studying the Xinhua News Agency's short commentaries "Eliminate Complacency and Eliminate Special Agents and Bandits" and "Protect the People's Motherland's Property" and the Military Control Commission's announcement. After mobilization, many reactionary party members have registered.
