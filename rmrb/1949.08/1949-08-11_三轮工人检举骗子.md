    Pedicab Worker Exposes Swindler
    [This Newspaper] On the evening of the 7th, around 11:30 PM, pedicab worker He Zhenwei picked up a passenger from 1 Kuan Street, Inner Fourth District, who appeared flustered. He Zhenwei noticed that this person was carrying a bolt of Wufu white cloth on his back late at night, hurried out, and kept urging him to pedal faster. Sensing something was amiss, when the pedicab reached the 18th Precinct of the Inner Fourth District at Xinjiekou, He Zhenwei stopped the pedicab and asked him to go to the police station for inspection. It turned out that this passenger was named Liu Wenzhong, a swindler. He had come to Peiping from Zhangjiakou and was staying at his friend Wang Zhuoqing's house. Before going to bed, he borrowed a bolt of cloth from Wang Lusheng, who lived in the same courtyard, to use as a pillow. Liu slept until late at night and, taking advantage of others being asleep, carried the cloth on his back, opened the door, hired a pedicab to go to Qianmen, and attempted to sell it and flee. The police station has now sent the suspect to the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau for processing.
