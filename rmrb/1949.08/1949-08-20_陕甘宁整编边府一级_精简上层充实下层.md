Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 18th: In accordance with the spirit of practicing strict economy advocated by the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, at its fifth administrative meeting held on August 9th, formulated a reorganization plan for the Border Region Government level. The plan calls for streamlining the upper-level leading organs and enriching the lower-level county, district, and township governments, as well as streamlining administrative organs' personnel and enriching public institutions (such as factories). The administrative meeting also decided to form a reorganization committee at the Border Region Government level, consisting of Wang Ziyi, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Wang Dacheng, Secretary-General, and Liu Yongru, Director of the Department of Finance, to begin the reorganization work immediately. At the meeting, Liu Jingfan, Acting Chairman of the Border Region Government, said: "We must adapt to the situation in the new areas, resolutely implement the reorganization plan, streamline unnecessary and non-urgent personnel from the leading organs of the Border Region Government, and transfer them to enrich the lower levels, establish new rural governments in the new areas, and do a good job in organizing and mobilizing the masses. We are not a bureaucratic organization and can greatly reduce logistical personnel and organize them to go to the production sector. In order to improve the effectiveness of our administrative work, in addition to the efforts of all cadres, we also require responsible comrades at all levels to take action personally." The meeting also criticized the lack of organization and discipline in the administrative departments. After entering Xi'an, many departments expanded their institutions, recruited and employed personnel, and established new institutions without authorization, failing to properly implement the reporting system and failing to seriously implement the budget and final account system and the revenue and expenditure reporting system.

　　陕甘宁整编边府一级
  　精简上层充实下层
    【新华社西安十八日电】根据中共中央西北局厉行精简节约的精神，陕甘宁边区政府于八月九日召开的第五次政务会议中，制订了边府一级的整编计划，决定精简上层领导机关，充实下层县、区、乡政府；精简行政机关人员，充实事业机关（如工厂等）。行政会议并决定以民政厅长王子宜、秘书长王达成、财政厅长刘墉如等组成边府一级的整编委员会，即日开始整编工作。会上，边府代主席刘景范说：“我们必须适应新区的情况，坚决执行整编计划，从边府领导机关中精简不必需和不急需的人员，调派充实到下层去，建立起新区乡村政府，做好组织与发动人民群众的工作。我们不是官僚机构，大可减少勤杂人员，组织他们到生产部门中去。为了提高我们的行政工作效能，除了全体干部努力外，还要求各级首长负责同志亲自动手。”会议并批评了行政部门存在的无组织、无纪律的现象。进入西安后，许多部门擅自扩大机构、招收雇用人员、建立新的机构等，未很好执行请示报告制度，亦未认真执行财政开支的预决算制度和收支报告制度。
