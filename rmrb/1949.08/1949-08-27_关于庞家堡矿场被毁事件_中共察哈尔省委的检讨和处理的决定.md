(Chahar News) The CCP Chahar Provincial Committee recently conducted a profound self-criticism regarding the severe destruction of the Pangjiabao Mine of the Longyan Iron Mine and made a decision on handling the incident. The original text is as follows:

　　Since the re-liberation of the Longyan Iron Mine's Pangjiabao Mine in August of last year, the remaining important equipment has been continuously damaged. Although the local government and the mine have implemented some protective measures, they have not been able to effectively stop it, and this serious destruction phenomenon has intensified. It was not until the "Protect the Property of the People's Motherland" and other short commentaries were published by Xinhua News Agency in June of this year, that the Provincial Committee further decided to take concrete steps to strengthen mine protection. At the same time, the People's Daily also exposed it, calling for a resolute struggle against bureaucracy that disregards the interests of the state and the people. After the North China Supervisory Bureau supervised the local government to thoroughly investigate, the destruction was stopped, but it had already caused incalculable losses to the people's national property. According to what has now been ascertained, half of the electric wire iron frames that were largely intact at the time of liberation (about twenty tons) have been dismantled, and only more than 50,000 meters of the 140,000 meters of high-voltage lines remain. More than 100 motors and various valuable equipment and accessories that had already been damaged were continuously stolen and destroyed. This enormous loss undoubtedly adds serious difficulties to the future recovery and development of the mine.

　　What basic lessons can be drawn from this painful major event? What shortcomings and errors does it expose in our leadership style and the thinking of our party members and cadres? It is essential to examine and correctly understand these.

　　First, our party and government leading organs at all levels—first and foremost the Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Government—have extremely serious bureaucratic work styles. The provincial level did not pay any attention to the mine protection issue beforehand. After the destruction was discovered, although the Provincial Government had issued instructions and orders for mine protection, it consistently lacked supervision and inspection, and did not arrange any effective measures or specific organizational work. The practical difficulties encountered in implementation were not resolved. No wonder the "instructions" and "orders" all failed! Secondly, many cadres at the district and county levels adopted an erroneous attitude of perfunctory and irresponsible implementation of the superior's mine protection instructions. For example, the Chahar South Prefectural Office, every time it received instructions from above, would write "Handed over to the Industry and Commerce Section for filing" and then put them on the archive shelf. What a serious dereliction of duty and anarchic and undisciplined error!

　　Second, when observing and handling problems, our general county, district, and even higher-level leading organs often maintain a narrow rural perspective and cannot consider the overall situation. They lack a clear understanding of the policy of cities leading villages and urban-rural coordination. They mistakenly believe that concern for industrial and mining construction is only a matter for the urban party committees and governments, and that this issue does not exist within the scope of their work, or they believe that the mine has been assigned to the North China Enterprise Department and take an irresponsible attitude. Even worse, they damage the overall interests for their own local interests. For example, Zhao Ke, secretary of the Seventh District Committee of Xuanhua County, ordered a communication worker to cut high-voltage lines and modify them for installing telephone lines for the government. Similar phenomena also exist within the Longyan Iron Mine Company itself. When the company erected transmission equipment near Yangjiaying, it dismantled more than 8,000 meters of high-voltage lines without the consent of the higher authorities or notifying the local government. In many cases, it also bought mining equipment illegally trafficked by private merchants. This inadvertently opened a prelude to large-scale destructive activities.

　　Third, many of our cadres also have confused ideas about what "mass viewpoint" is. They do not proceed from actively developing production and construction, or from the fundamental interests of the vast majority of the people. Instead, they focus on passive relief and alms, preferring to sacrifice important national wealth to take care of so-called "disaster victims" and "poor people." In reality, however, most of those who benefit are profiteers, thieves, and idlers who do not engage in production. Dominated by this erroneous thinking, they often adopt a conciliatory attitude towards offending profiteers and lawbreakers. For example, the Third District of Xuanhua City uncovered 27 cases of trafficking in mine equipment in a short period, but all ended without resolution, which in effect encouraged the growth of destructive and thieving practices.

　　Fourth, we must be vigilant that after the complete liberation of our entire province of Chahar, some cadres who have entered the cities, under the invasion of the consciousness of the exploiting classes and the enticement of various pleasures, have begun to develop a mood of peaceful enjoyment, and even at the cost of undermining policies, laws, and the influence of the Party, are moving towards corruption and degeneration.

　　In the process of the serious destruction of the mine, Yao Ziming, deputy chief of the Industry and Commerce Section of Xuanhua City, not only disregarded the instructions from higher levels regarding mine protection, but also repeatedly wrote letters of introduction for profiteers, helping them to steal and sell mine equipment. In addition, Chen Fushun, director of the police station in the Third District of the city, confiscated more than 1,000 kilograms of smuggled copper wire, privately released the criminal, and entrusted another profiteer to sell it in Beiping. These facts should arouse sufficient vigilance and attention among all our party members and cadres!

　　Fifth, it must be pointed out that many district and village cadres, militiamen, and the masses, out of righteous indignation and a sense of responsibility for the criminal acts of destroying state property, have constantly suggested and requested that local leading organs seriously deal with them. Many of them have also actively and conscientiously implemented the higher-level mine protection calls, diligently patrolling and guarding, and inspecting private merchants and petty thieves, but often they have not received the attention and support of the leadership. Those who should be punished were not punished, and those who should be rewarded were not rewarded. As a result, justice could not be upheld, and a broad mass mine protection movement could not be created to assist the specialized management agencies in closely protecting this important mine. This experience should also be remembered.

　　In order to quickly eradicate the phenomenon of destruction, conscientiously and responsibly protect the people's national property, it is necessary to improve and strengthen specialized mine protection agencies, clarify responsibilities, establish an inspection system, launch a mass mine protection movement around the mine, mobilize the masses to return the lost machinery and equipment to the public, and recover those that have been stolen and sold as much as possible, report and punish special agents, bandits, and severely destructive elements. In addition, the above lessons should be thoroughly educated among all our party members and cadres to raise vigilance, launch a struggle against all phenomena that disregard the state and people's property and violate the overall interests, strictly enforce Party discipline, rectify national discipline, resolutely oppose corruption and other shameful behaviors, and maintain the fine tradition of hard work and struggle in the revolutionary ranks. Regarding the handling of the Pangjiabao mine incident, in addition to requesting the higher authorities to give the due punishment, the Provincial Committee has made the following decisions on the handling of relevant departments and party cadres:

　　(1) Give strict criticism to the Chahar South (including the original Nankou and Chahar South Prefectures) Prefectural Committee, the party group of the Prefectural Office, and the Longguan and Xuanhua County Committees, and order them to continue to conduct in-depth self-criticism and submit a written decision report to the Provincial Committee.

　　(2) Yao Ziming, deputy chief of the Industry and Commerce Section of Xuanhua City, and Chen Fushun, director of the police station in the Third District, shall be removed from their administrative positions and dealt with according to the specific circumstances. Zhao Ke, secretary of the Seventh District Committee of Xuanhua County, shall be immediately dismissed and remain in the local committee for in-depth reflection. The Prefectural Committee shall submit its handling opinions to the Provincial Committee for approval and implementation.

　　(3) It is proposed that the Longyan Iron Mine Company conduct a self-criticism on its tendency of anarchism and indiscipline and its violation of policies in buying mine equipment from private merchants.

　　(4) It is ordered that the Chahar South Prefectural Committee instruct the local government party group to investigate cadres and masses who have actively implemented the instructions from higher levels and made meritorious contributions to mine protection, report to the higher-level government, and give commendations and rewards.

　　关于庞家堡矿场被毁事件
    中共察哈尔省委的检讨和处理的决定
    【察哈尔讯】中共察哈尔省委顷对龙烟铁矿庞家堡矿场遭受严重破坏事件，作了深刻的检讨，并作出对该事件处理的决定。原文如下：
    龙烟铁矿庞家堡矿场，从去年八月重新解放后，得以保存下来的部分重要设备就不断遭到破坏，当地政府和矿方虽曾实施过某些保护措置，但一直没有能有效地加以制止，这种严重的破坏现象并且愈演愈烈。直到今年六月新华社发表了“保护人民祖国的财产”等短评，省委才进一步决定采取具体步骤，加强护矿工作；同时人民日报亦加以揭发，号召与漠视国家人民利益的官僚主义坚决斗争，并经华北监察院督导当地政府彻底检查后，始停止了破坏，但是已经造成人民国家财产不可估量的损失。据现已经查清的，解放时大体保持完整的电线铁架，已有半数（约二十吨）被拆毁，长达十四万米的高压线仅残存五万多米，百余部原来已遭破坏的电动机与各种贵重器材及附件继续被偷盗损毁。这种浩大的损失，无疑给今后该矿的恢复发展增加了严重的困难。
    从这一痛心的重大事件里，可以得出那些基本教训它暴露了我们领导作风以及党员干部思想上存在什么缺点错误？对这些加以检讨和正确认识是十分必要的。
    第一、我们各级党政领导机关——首先是省委、省人民政府，存在着极为严重的官僚主义作风。对于护矿问题，省级事先根本没有注意到，后来发现破坏以后，虽然也曾由省府发布过护矿的指示、训令，但始终缺乏督促检查，更没有布置过任何有效的措施与具体的组织工作，执行中遇到的若干实际困难亦未加以解决；无怪乎“指示”“训令”全都落空！其次分区与县级不少干部，对执行上级护矿指示采取了敷衍塞责的错误态度，甚至如察南专署每次接到上级的指令后都批上“交工商科存查”便塞进了档案架子，这是何等严重的玩忽职守和无政府无纪律错误！
    第二、我们一般县、区以至更高级领导机关，在观察和处理问题时，常常仍保持狭隘的农村观点，不能从全局着眼，对城市领导乡村与城乡配合的方针缺乏明确认识，错误地认为关心工矿业建设仅是城市党委和政府的事情，在自己所属工作范围内则不存在这一问题，或是认为该矿已经划归华北企业部管辖，便采取不负责任的态度。尤其甚者，为了本身局部利益而破坏整体利益。如宣化县七区区委书记赵克，为了架设机关用的电话线，竟指使通讯员割取高压线加以改装。类似现象，在龙烟铁矿公司本身也是存在的，该公司架设杨家营附近输电设备时，未经上级同意，亦未通知当地政府就擅自拆卸长达八千多米的高压线，在许多场合下并收买过私商违法贩运的矿山器材。这无形中给大规模破坏活动开了一个启端。
    第三、对于什么是“群众观点”，我们不少干部也存在着糊涂思想，他们不是从积极发展生产建设，从绝大多数人民的根本利益出发；而是偏重于消极的救济恩赐，宁肯因小失大，牺牲国家重要的财富去照顾所谓“灾民”“穷人”；而实际上得到实惠的则大多数是奸商、小偷和不事生产的游民。由于这种错误思想支配着，故对犯案的奸商和不法分子常常采取姑息态度。如宣化市三区短期内曾查获二十七起贩运矿场器材的案件，结果都是不了了之，这实际上是鼓励了破坏偷盗风气的滋长。
    第四、必须警惕，自我察省全部解放后，某些进入城市的干部，在剥削阶级意识侵袭和各种声色引诱下，开始滋长着太平享乐情绪，甚至不惜破坏政策法令和党的影响，走向贪污堕落的道路。
    在该矿场遭受严重破坏过程中，宣化市工商科副科长姚子明，不但将上级屡次关于护矿工作的指示置诸不顾，还竟多次给奸商写介绍信，帮助奸商盗卖矿山器材。又该市三区派出所长陈福顺，没收走私铜丝千余斤，将人犯私自开释后，委托另一个奸商去北平出售。这些事实应引起我全体党员、干部足够的警惕和注意！
    第五、必须指出：有不少区、村干部、民兵以及群众，对破坏国家财产的罪恶行为，激于义愤和责任感，曾不断建议和要求当地领导机关认真予以处置。他们当中许多人并自动积极地执行上级护矿号召，辛勤巡逻看守，检查私商、小盗，但是往往得不到领导上的重视和支持，应罚的未罚，应赏的未赏。以致正气无法伸张，未能借此造成一个广泛的群众性护矿运动，以辅助专管机构周密保护这一重要矿场。这一个经验亦应该被记取。
    为了迅速根绝破坏现象，严肃负责地保护人民国家财产，必须健全与加强专门护矿机构，严明职责，树立检查制度，在矿场周围开展群众性护矿运动，动员群众将失散民间的机件器材交还公家，已经盗卖者要尽可能追回，检举与惩办特务匪徒及罪行深重的破坏分子。此外并应将上述教训在我全体党员、干部中深入进行教育，借以提高警惕性，与一切漠视国家人民财产和违背整体利益现象展开斗争，严肃党纪，整饬国家纪律，坚决反对贪污腐化等可耻行为，保持革命队伍艰苦奋斗的优良作风。对于庞家堡矿场事件的处理，省委除自请上级给予应得处分外，并对有关的各部门及党员干部的处理作如下决定：
    （一）给予察南（包括原南口察南两分区）地委、专署党组及龙关和宣化县委以严格批评，责成他们继续深刻的进行检讨，做出书面决定报告省委。
    （二）宣化市工商科副科长姚子明，三区派出所长陈福顺由行政上撤职，根据具体情节议处。宣化县七区区委书记赵克着即撤职，留地委处深刻反省，由地委提出处理意见报告省委批准执行。
    （三）提议龙烟铁矿公司，对本身无政府无纪律倾向及违反政策向私商收买矿场器材行为进行检讨。
    （四）责成察南地委转令当地政府党组调查积极执行上级指令，护矿有功的干部、群众，报告上级政府，给予表扬奖励。
