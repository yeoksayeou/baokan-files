    Privately Run Nursery
    Government Does Not Allocate Housing
    Editor:
    I worked as an elementary school teacher for several years in the old society and am deeply interested in raising children. Therefore, I would like to serve the new society and plan to open a private nursery. I only need the government to allocate a house, and I will be responsible for all other preparations. However, I am unsure whether the People's Government has established regulations for this matter, and where I should go to begin initial contact. I hope you can provide a detailed answer! Wishing you good health.

    Mr. Mao Shuyi:
    When opening a private nursery, you can submit an application for registration to the People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau during the preparation period. After the bureau sends personnel to investigate and verify, if it meets the requirements, registration and filing will be approved. Regarding the issue of requesting housing allocation, since it is privately run, the government cannot allocate it. You can rent it yourself.

    私人自办托儿所
    公家不拨给房子编辑先生：
    我在旧社会曾担任数年的小学教员工作，对于抚养儿童深感兴趣，所以我很想为新社会服务，打算办一个私立托儿所，只须公家拨给房舍一所，其余一切均由自己筹办，惟这一事情进行，人民政府有无既定章程，初步接洽应先到何处去办，均望先生赐一详细答复为荷！祝撰安  毛淑仪毛淑仪先生：
    开办私立托儿所，在筹办期间，可呈请人民政府民政局登记；经派员调查审核后，如合格即准予登记备案。关于请拨房舍问题，因系私办，政府不能拨给，可自己租赁。
