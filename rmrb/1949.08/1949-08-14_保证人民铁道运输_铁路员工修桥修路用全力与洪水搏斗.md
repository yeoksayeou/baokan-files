(Ping Shi News) Railway employees on all lines are fighting against the floods. Since the beginning of the rainy season, up to the end of July, the foundations and bridges of as many as 76 places on the northern railway lines alone were destroyed by floods due to continuous heavy rains. In coastal areas, the damage from floods caused by typhoons and rainstorms is even more severe. However, railway employees on all lines are now fighting with all their strength to overcome the floods and ensure that the people's railway transportation business is not affected. At the eastern roadbed of Bridge No. 110 between Beidaihe Station and Liushouying Station, the Kuomintang bandit troops dug four large trenches more than ten meters long before liberation. Although they were filled after liberation, they were completely washed away again after being hit by rain. When track worker Zhang Zhong saw this, he immediately reported to supervisor Dong Shaotang, and immediately mobilized more than 70 employees in the entire area to move stones and load them into trucks to fill the trenches. They built the embankment in three hours despite the heavy rain. The train operation was not affected during the repair.

The Bridge Engineering Team of the Taiyuan Railway Administration rushed to repair bridges on the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan line day and night in the rain, restoring 12 permanent bridges and deducting 19 holes in 11 days.

On July 20, the water level of the Daqing River rose sharply, only two meters away from the temporary bridge, and the bridge holes were blocked by firewood and mud washed down from the upper reaches. Fifty-odd workers from the Kaiyuan Road Maintenance Section, led by road maintenance worker Tian Baofu, jumped into the rapids to clear the bridge holes, and the water receded gradually, avoiding the danger of the roadbed being washed away.

The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway repair project was interrupted for four days due to the typhoon and rainstorm that hit on July 24. In order to ensure the opening of traffic on August 1, the employees worked five consecutive night shifts and finally successfully completed the task.

On July 24, more than 100 meters of the 108-kilometer section of the eastern line of the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway was washed away by floods. The Yangquan employees spontaneously organized a mutual aid repair team, and drivers, conductors, and station masters all participated. On August 8, the third hole of the Luanhe Old Bridge was washed away by water, and the upper flower was washed away 100 meters. The Luanxian government mobilized the masses to recover the sleepers.

    保证人民铁道运输
    铁路员工修桥修路用全力与洪水搏斗
    【平市讯】各线铁路员工正在与洪水作斗争。自雨季开始以来，截至七月底止，仅北方各铁路线，即因连日大雨被洪水冲毁路基及桥梁达七十六处。沿海地区由于狂风暴雨袭击，水害更甚。但现各线铁路员工正在用全力搏斗，要战胜洪水，保证人民铁道运输事业不受损失。北戴河站留守营站之间一一○号桥东路基，解放前被国民党匪军挖了四个十余米长的大壕沟。解放后虽填补好了，但经过雨水一冲又完全冲毁。道班工人张仲看到后，立刻报告监工员董绍棠，马上发动全区职工七十余人，搬石装车去填壕沟。他们冒着大雨在三小时内把堤筑好。抢修中没有影响列车运行。
    太原铁路管理局桥梁工程队，日夜冒雨赶修石太线桥梁，十一天恢复永久桥梁十二座，扣十九孔。
    七月二十日，大清河水位急剧上涨，离便桥只二米多高，桥孔又被上流冲下来的柴草淤泥堵塞。开原路工处养路工区工人五十余，由养路工人田保富领头跳下急流中，疏通桥孔，水势才渐退。避免了路基被冲毁的危险。
    这次沪杭铁路抢修工程因七月二十四日台风骤雨袭来，使工程停顿达四天之久。职工们为了保证八一通车，曾连加五个夜工，终于胜利完成任务。
    石太路东线一○八公里处七月二十四日被洪水冲毁百余米，阳泉职工们自动组织了互助抢修队，司机、车长、站长都参加了。八月八日滦河老桥第三孔枕木垛被水冲走，上花被冲出一百公尺，滦县政府发动了群众抢回枕木。
