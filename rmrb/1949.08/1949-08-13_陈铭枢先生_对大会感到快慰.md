    Mr. Chen Mingshu believes: This representative conference represents the will of Shanghai's six million people and discusses the general plan for building a new Shanghai. The representatives at the conference naturally expressed heartfelt belief and support for the leaders of the Party and government authorities, which is of course due to the Communist Party and the People's Government's sincere dedication to serving the people. This is something I have never seen in my many years of political experience. Therefore, no matter how difficult or arduous the current situation is, the people have great hopes for the government and great confidence in it. This is what I personally feel sincerely happy and comforted about regarding this conference.

    对大会感到快慰
    陈铭枢先生认为：这次代表大会为代表上海六百万人民意志的会议，讨论建设新上海的方针大计。大会的代表们对党政当局等首长，均很自然表现出衷心的信仰和拥护，这当然是由于共产党和人民政府为人民服务的方针有精诚表现。这是我多年从政经验中没有见到过的。因之，不管目前如何困难，如何艰苦，但人民对政府抱有很大希望，抱有很大信心，这是个人对此次大会感到衷心愉快和安慰之处。
