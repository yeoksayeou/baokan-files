    Jinan Ten Months After Liberation
    Significant Development Achieved in Industries Such as Textiles and Iron Smelting
    [Our Dispatch] Jinan News: Jinan Mayor Yao Zhongming reported on the government's work over the past ten months at the second day (August 2nd) of the Jinan City Representatives Conference. He said: In the ten months since the liberation of Jinan, production has been rapidly restored and developed. According to a survey of 22 types of machinery industries at the end of last December (three months after liberation), most have resumed work except for those that suffered excessive losses in the war (such as the flour industry) or had been shut down for many years (such as the brick and tile industry) and could not be repaired immediately. According to the survey, there are a total of 485 factories in the city, with 402 having resumed work (accounting for 82 percent) and 83 not yet resumed (accounting for 18 percent). Among those that have resumed work, some are operating all machines regularly, while others are not yet able to operate regularly. Among the 402 households, 278 are operating all machines regularly (accounting for 67 percent), 97 are operating more than half of their machines (accounting for 24 percent), and 31 are operating less than half of their machines (accounting for 8 percent). He said that, except for special circumstances, all industries in Jinan have fully resumed work, and many industries have achieved considerable development. For example, in the textile industry, the highest monthly output before liberation was 1,040 pieces of yarn. The output in April was 1,170 pieces, an increase of 12 percent. In the pig iron industry, there were 35 households before liberation, now increased to 47. The monthly iron consumption before liberation was 150,800 jin, and in April it was 270,000 jin, an increase of 72 percent. The match industry has increased from 9 to 12 households, and the product has increased by 82 percent. The number of oil pressing households has increased by one and a half times. Other industries such as flour, sawing, machinery, and transportation are also doing better than before liberation.

    济南解放十个月
    纺织制铁等工业均获得显著发展
    【本报讯】济南消息：济南市市长姚仲明于济市各界代表会第二日（八月二日）报告十个月来的政府工作，他说：济市解放十个月来，生产已得到迅速的恢复和发展：根据去年十二月底（解放后三个月）二十二种机器工业的调查，除在战争中损失过大（如面粉业），或多年停工（如砖瓦业），一时不能修复者外，其余大部复工。据调查全市工厂共有四百八十五家，复工者四百零二家（占百分之八十二），尚未复工者八十三家（占百分之十八）。已复工者有的全部机器经常开动，有的还不能经常开动，计四○二户当中，经常全部开动者二百七十八户（占百分之六十七），开半机以上者九十七户（占百分之二十四），开半机以下者三十一户（占百分之八）。他说，除去特殊情况者外，济南工业已全部复工，并有不少工业得到相当发展。如纺织业解放前每月最高产量为一千零四十件纱，四月份产量一千一百七十件，增加百分之十二。生铁业解放前三十五家，现增至四十七家，解放前每月用铁十五万零八百斤，四月份用二十七万斤，增加百分之七十二。火柴业由九家增至十二家，产品增加百分之八十二。榨油业户数增加一倍半。其他如面粉、锯木、机器、运输等行业营业都比解放前好。
