Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 1st: The Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee recently summarized its work for July and made new additions to the previously stipulated three-month work tasks for June, July, and August. It emphasized the need to overcome the confrontational thinking between workers and trade union staff in state-owned factories and the administration, with the organization and education of employees to complete production tasks as the most basic work of the trade union. This summary and supplementary explanation of the work tasks were conveyed by Qiu Jin, deputy director of the Preparatory Committee, to the city's trade union cadres' meeting on June 28th. In Qiu Jin's report, it was pointed out that the three major tasks of the trade union work stipulated in the past three months—implementing democratic management in state-owned factories, implementing the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital in private factories, and organizing trade unions—were correct. However, the production issue was not explicitly mentioned at that time. It did not emphasize that organizing and educating employees to complete production tasks was the most basic task of the trade union, and all other work should be subordinate to this task. Therefore, the trade union work in state-owned factories was not closely coordinated with the administrative aspects. The trade union paid little attention to the administrative production plans, and the administration rarely explained its production intentions to the trade union. Qiu Jin said: Restoring and developing production is the common central task of both the administrative side and the trade union in state-owned factories. The two should adopt different methods to complete this common task. The administrative side should focus on formulating plans, procuring raw materials, implementing cost accounting, selling finished products, and allocating manpower and material resources, but all of these should be promptly understood by the trade union and the vast number of employees; while the trade union should focus on organizing and educating employees, improving their awareness and production enthusiasm, and enabling them to consciously complete production tasks. In addition, the trade union should also carry out employee welfare, labor insurance, cultural and recreational activities, etc., but the purpose of carrying out these tasks is precisely to directly or indirectly ensure the completion of production tasks. In private enterprises, the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital should be implemented, and workers should be made aware that this is to enable workers to consciously restore and develop production together with capitalists. This is the first point that should be added to the trade union's work guidelines. Second, is the reasonable solution of wage issues. The three-month work tasks did not raise the wage issue as a problem. Based on the current situation, this issue should be raised today for a reasonable solution. Third, in order to develop production, employees in both public and private enterprises should be called upon to strictly abide by labor discipline and factory rules.

In summarizing the work of Tianjin workers in July, Qiu Jin pointed out that the main problem was in the area of democratic management in state-owned factories. According to statistics in mid-July, among the 96 units of the five trade unions of textile, hardware, municipal enterprises, chemical industry, and production alliance, only 30 units had established factory management committees, less than one-third; most of the established factory management committees were still unsound. The main reasons why the democratic management movement did not achieve significant results were insufficient attention to this work and deviations in understanding among administrative and trade union personnel and workers in enterprises: some administrative personnel opposed administrative management to democratic management, believing that workers' opinions on administrative matters were a "trouble"; while some workers and trade union staff members believed that trade unions and employee representative conferences were simply to seek narrow economic interests for workers, and did not pay attention to striving to increase production and solve workers' living problems through the development of production, and even mistakenly believed that the management committee was merely an organization to control employees, resulting in certain uncoordinated phenomena between administrative leadership and trade union work.

The experience of implementing democratic management in Tianjin is:

First, relying on the masses is the guarantee of improving production. This requires enterprise management personnel to pay attention to the demands and opinions of the masses at all times, especially in such major issues as formulating production plans, workers should conduct discussions and deliberations to stimulate their production enthusiasm, so that all major measures of the factory can be consciously supported by the vast number of employees. The China Match Factory Management Committee once improved personnel relations that were not conducive to production based on the correct opinions of the masses of employees. As a result, the enthusiasm of workers for production increased greatly, and the workers took the initiative to propose the establishment of strict labor discipline, and the quantity and quality of products have been greatly improved. When the Steel Fittings Factory of the Ministry of Railways formulated its production plan in May, the initial plan was for 350,000 track spikes and 160,000 square irons. The administration felt it was too heavy and was afraid it could not be completed; but in the enthusiastic discussion of employee representatives and active workers, this production plan was considered to be set too low. The workers proposed to revise the plan and increase the planned quantity of products. As a result, the square iron completed the plan, and the track spikes exceeded the revised plan by more than 20,000.

Second, administrative leaders must overcome the bad tendencies of neglecting trade union work and neglecting the masses. When a military representative of a factory streamlined the organization, he only convened meetings with the factory director and section chiefs, and the work team and employee representatives did not know about it, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the workers. Individual factories even had managers who suspected workers of stealing and used illegal methods such as beatings. This tendency to be divorced from the masses is a fatal injury to running factories and enterprises well and must be resolutely corrected.

Third, education for workers and trade union cadres should be strengthened to improve workers' production enthusiasm and discipline and thoroughly overcome economism and ultra-democracy among workers and trade union cadres, as well as thoughts and emotions of confrontation with the administration.

Regarding the implementation of the policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital, Qiu Jin pointed out that in July, due to the communication of this policy in the employee representative meetings, and some industry trade unions also used training classes to explain it, generally speaking, the mood of workers insisting on demanding excessive treatment has been gradually overcome, but most workers have not truly understood and truly accepted the policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital in their thinking, so trade union cadres should still devote great efforts to persuading and educating workers in the future. At present, one or two major industries should be selected for a comprehensive and in-depth investigation, and collective contracts should be formulated based on the actual situation, in order to gradually resolve and reduce labor-capital disputes.

Regarding the issue of trade union organization, Qiu Jin said that there are now more than 50,000 employees in the city who have joined trade unions, and some units in the railway, municipal enterprises, textile, and other systems have organized formal trade unions. Qiu Jin pointed out that the tendency of closed-doorism should be corrected in the development of membership, and after the establishment of trade unions, the organization of trade unions should be consolidated, and the growth of guild sectarian localism within the trade unions should be prevented.

    丘金总结津七月份工会工作
    必须贯彻管理民主化
    克服与行政对抗思想
    【新华社天津一日电】天津市总工会筹委会最近总结了七月份的工作，并对前已规定的六七八三个月工会工作任务有新的补充，强调地提出克服公营工厂工人和工会工作人员与行政对抗的思想，以组织和教育职工完成生产任务，作为工会最基本的工作。这个总结和工作任务补充的说明，已由筹委会副主任丘金于六月二十八日向全市工会干部会议传达。丘金的报告中指出，过去规定的三个月工会工作的三大任务——公营工厂贯彻管理民主化、私营工厂贯彻劳资两利方针以及组织工会，是正确的。但当时对生产问题提得不明确。没有强调组织和教育职工完成生产任务是工会最基本的任务，其他一切工作都应该服从这一任务。因而没有把公营工厂的工会工作与行政方面密切配合起来。工会对行政上的生产计划很少注意，行政上也很少向工会说明生产意图。丘金说：恢复和发展生产，是公营工厂行政方面和工会的共同的中心任务。两者应该采取不同的方法完成这个共同任务，行政上应着重于制订计划、筹购原料、执行成本会计、推销成品以及人力物力的配备组织等，但所有这些，都应及时地使工会和广大职工了解；而工会则应着重于组织、教育职工，提高他们的觉悟和生产热情，使他们自觉地完成生产任务。此外，工会还应该进行职工福利、劳动保险、文化娱乐活动等，但进行这些工作其目的也正是为了直接地或间接地保证生产任务的完成。在私营企业中应贯彻劳资两利的方针，并要使工人认识到这是为了使工人自觉地与资本家共同恢复和发展生产。这是工会工作方针应该补充的第一点。第二、是合理地解决工资问题。三个月工作任务中没有把工资问题当做一个问题提出来，根据目前情况，这一问题今天应提出来作一合理解决。第三、为了发展生产，在公私营企业中应该号召职工严守劳动纪律和厂规。
    在总结七月份津市工人工作时，丘金指出主要的问题是在公营工厂管理民主化方面。据七月中统计，在纺织、五金、市政企业、化学及产联五个工会的九十六个单位中，建立工厂管委会的只有三十个单位，还不到三分之一；已建立的工厂管委会大部分还是不健全的。管理民主化运动没有显著成绩主要原因在于企业中的行政和工会人员及工人对这个工作注意不足和认识上存在偏向：有些行政人员把行政管理与管理民主化对立起来，认为工人对行政上提意见是一种“麻烦”；而有些工人和工会工作人员则认为工会和职工代表会是单纯地为工人谋狭隘的经济利益的，而不注意努力增加生产，由发展生产来解决工人的生活问题，甚至错误地认为管理委员会仅仅只是管制职工的组织，结果使行政领导与工会工作形成某些不协调的现象。
    津市实行管理民主化的经验是：
    第一、依靠群众是提高生产的保证，这就要求企业管理人员时刻注意群众的要求和意见，特别是在制订生产计划这样重大的问题中，更应由工人进行讨论酝酿，启发他们的生产积极性，使工厂的一切重大措施，都能得到广大职工的自觉支持。中华火柴厂管委会曾根据职工群众的正确意见，改进了不利于生产的人事关系，结果工人生产积极性大增，工人主动地提出建立严格的劳动纪律，产品数量质量都大有改进。铁道部钢铁配件厂五月份制订生产计划时，开头计划出道钉三十五万个，方铁十六万块，行政上觉得太重，恐怕完成不了；但在职工代表和工人积极分子的热烈讨论中，这个生产计划却被认为定得过低。工人们提议修改了这个计划，而增加了产品数量的计划。结果方铁完成计划，道钉较增订计划还超过两万个。
    第二、行政负责人必须克服轻视工会工作、轻视群众等不良倾向。某厂军事代表在精简机构时，只召集厂长、科长开会，工作组和职工代表都不知道，结果引起工人群众不满。个别厂甚至发生了管理人员对其所怀疑有偷窃行为的工人采用吊打等非法的事件。这种脱离群众的倾向，是办好工厂企业的致命伤，必须坚决纠正。
    第三、应加强对工人和工会干部的教育，提高工人的生产积极性和纪律性，彻底克服工人和工会干部中的经济主义和极端民主化以及与行政上对抗的思想和情绪。
    关于贯彻劳资两利政策的情形，丘金指出，七月份由于在职工代表会中进行了这一政策的传达，有些行业工会还用了训练班的方式进行讲解，一般地说工人中坚持要求过高待遇的情绪已被逐步克服了，但大部分工人在思想上还没有真正懂得和真正接受劳资两利的政策，因此工会干部今后仍应以极大力量对工人进行说服教育工作。目前则应选择一两个主要行业，进行全面深入调查，根据实际情况，制订集体合同，以便逐步解决和减少劳资纠纷。
    关于工会组织问题，丘金说全市现在已有五万多职工加入了工会，铁路、市政企业、纺织等系统有些单位已组织了正式公会。丘金指出，在发展会员中应纠正关门主义倾向，在成立工会之后应该巩固工会的组织，并防止行会帮派本位思想在工会内滋长。
