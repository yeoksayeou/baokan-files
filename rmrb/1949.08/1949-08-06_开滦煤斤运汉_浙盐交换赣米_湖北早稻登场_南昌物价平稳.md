    Kailuan Coal Shipped to Hankou
    Zhejiang Salt Exchanged for Jiangxi Rice
    Hubei Early Rice Harvested
    Nanchang Prices Stable
    ▲ 1,300 tons of Kailuan coal arrived in Wuhan on July 28th via the Beining, Jinpu, Longhai, and Pinghan railways. This is part of the 30,000 tons of bituminous coal purchased by the Central China Trade Corporation from the Pingjin Coal and Iron Company last month. The remaining portion will also be shipped south successively. In addition, the 2 million dan of Changlu salt purchased by the Central China Trade Corporation in Tianjin is also being negotiated for shipment south.
    ▲ Hangzhou Zhejiang Minsheng Company is actively exchanging Zhejiang salt for Jiangxi rice. Among the Jiangxi rice purchased by the company, over 8,000 shi have been successively transported to Hangzhou.
    ▲ Early rice in Hubei is being harvested, and new grain from Wuhan is already on the market. To prevent manipulation by unscrupulous merchants, the city's trade corporation has jointly cooperated with the Railway Bureau, Trust Company, and cooperatives to control grain prices and provide appropriate purchases.
    ▲ In Nanchang, under the influence of the opening of the Zhegan Railway, the opening of Shanghai exchange, and the victory of the People's Liberation Army in liberating Ji'an and other places, prices once rose in early July, but began to stabilize and decline from the 13th, and prices were very stable until the end of the month. The credit of the Renminbi is becoming increasingly consolidated, and the black market price of silver dollars fell continuously from 4,000 yuan on July 12th to 2,400 yuan on the 20th.

    湖北早稻登场
    南昌物价平稳
    ▲开滦煤一千三百吨经由北宁、津浦、陇海、平汉等铁路，于七月二十八日运抵武汉。这是上月华中贸易总公司向平津煤铁公司购买的烟煤三万吨中的一部分，其余部分亦将陆续南运。又华中贸易总公司在津购买的长芦盐二百万市担亦正接洽南运。
    ▲杭州浙江民生公司刻正积极以浙盐易赣米。该公司所购之赣米中陆续运达杭市的已有八千余石。
    ▲湖北早稻登场，武汉新谷已上市。该市贸易公司为防奸商操纵，特联合铁路局、信托公司、合作社掌握粮价，并予适当收购。
    ▲南昌在浙赣路通车、申汇开放和人民解放军解放吉安等地的胜利影响下，物价在七月上旬一度上升，十三日起即平稳下跌，直到月底物价都很平稳。人民币信用日益巩固，银元黑市由七月十二日的四千元连续下跌至二十日的二千四百元。【新华社北平五日电】
