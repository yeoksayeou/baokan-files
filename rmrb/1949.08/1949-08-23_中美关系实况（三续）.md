　　The Reality of Sino-American Relations (Continued 3)
　　Wang Cheng
　　"Secret"?
　　Stimson's "non-recognition doctrine," a reprint of Chamberlain's appeasement policy, was finally smashed to pieces by the "Pearl Harbor Incident."
　　After this, the policy of American imperialism towards Japan changed, but at the same time, it wanted to turn China into its colony in the process of fighting against Japan.
　　In the early stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Stilwell came to China. The policy he represented was to demand direct command of all Chinese armed forces, attempting to take this opportunity to completely control China in the hands of American imperialism.
　　Stilwell had a falling out with Chiang Kai-shek, and Wei Demai was replaced. His policy was to equip the army of the Kuomintang reactionaries alone, preparing for the opportunity to help Chiang Kai-shek eliminate the Chinese People's Liberation Army, so that American imperialism could turn China into its colony.
　　Fifty days after Japan's surrender (September 30, 1945), the U.S. Marine Corps landed in Dagu; on October 2, they landed in Qinhuangdao; on October 10, the U.S. military entered the waters of Qingdao, and at the same time entered Wusongkou. These American soldiers coming from all directions numbered 113,000 according to reports.
　　Therefore, some people suspected at the time: when fighting Japan, we didn't see many American soldiers, but why did so many American soldiers come after Japan was defeated? Some people said: there is a "secret" here. However, American imperialism has its reasons. According to the theory of then U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, the U.S. military came to China at this time to "help China disarm the Japanese and send Japanese prisoners back home." (?)
　　Okay, but the question arises again, why did American imperialism send more than 200,000 troops of the Kuomintang reactionary government to North China and Northeast China, where the Kuomintang reactionary government could not reach? Also, why did American imperialism guard the communication lines for the Kuomintang reactionary government? Furthermore, why did the Kuomintang reactionary government receive 200 million yuan of concession materials, more than 800 million yuan of Pacific surplus materials, 271 naval vessels, and several hundred million yuan of materials from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War?
　　At this time, many people have seen what kind of medicine American imperialism is selling in its gourd. So some people said: the "secret" is to help fight the civil war.
　　Time flies quickly. Let's talk about "repatriating Japanese prisoners." There are no more Japanese prisoners in China. What reason does American imperialism have to keep the U.S. military in China? Truman has a "reason." He said: "Assist the military mediation department in finding the bodies of fallen American soldiers." It's a real ghost story!
　　Now, American imperialism has confessed to us what it was doing during this period:
　　"During this period, largely due to the assistance we gave their troops (referring to the Kuomintang reactionary government) in transportation, armament, and supplies, they were able to extend their control over most of North China and Northeast China until General Marshall left China in early 1947. At that time, the Kuomintang's military achievements and territorial expansion reached their peak." (Acheson's original letter to Truman)
　　After this, as is well known, the civil war broke out, and American aid poured in like a tide. And Wei Demai, MacArthur, and others simply stopped talking about "finding the bodies of American soldiers" and shouted about their "opposition to the Bolshevik threat" (?); however, the American imperialism that clamored for the "Bolshevik threat" not only threatened China, but also included the ruling area of the Kuomintang reactionary government, becoming the supreme emperor of the Kuomintang reactionary government.

　　中美关系实况（三续）
    王城
　　“秘密”？
    史汀生的“不承认主义”，这个张伯伦绥靖政策的再版，终于给“珍珠港事变”打得稀烂。
    此后，美国帝国主义对日本的政策改变了，但同时也想在对日作战的过程中，把中国变成它的殖民地。
    抗日战争初期，史迪威来中国，他所代表的政策，是要求直接统率中国一切武装部队，就是企图趁此把中国完全控制在美国帝国主义的手里。
    史迪威和蒋介石闹了蹩扭，换了个魏德迈来，他的政策是单独装备国民党反动政府的军队，准备有机会帮助蒋介石消灭中国人民解放军，以便于美国帝国主义把中国变成它的殖民地。
    在日本投降后第五十天（一九四五年九月三十日），美军陆战队在大沽登陆；十月二日又在秦皇岛登陆；十月十日美军开入青岛海面，同时进入吴淞口。这四方八面来的美国大兵，据报上公布，共有十一万三千人。
    因此，当时就有人怀疑：在打日本的时候，没见几个美国大兵，日本打倒了，为啥来了这么多的美国大兵？有人说：这里头有“秘密。”但是，美国帝国主义是有它的理由的，依当时美国国务卿贝纳斯的理论，这时美军来华是为了“帮助中国解除日本武装和遣送日本俘虏回国”的。（？）
    好的，但问题又来了，为什么美国帝国主义把二十多万国民党反动政府的军队，送到国民党反动政府到不了的华北、东北呢？还有，为什么美国帝国主义给国民党反动政府把守交通线呢？再者，为什么在抗日胜利后给国民党反动政府二亿元的租界物资，八亿元以上的太平洋剩余物资，二百七十一艘海军船只，几亿元的善后救济总署的物资呢？
    这时，不少人已看出美国帝国主义的葫芦里卖的是什么药了。于是有人说：“秘密”就是帮助打内战。
    时间很快，就说“遣送日俘”吧，在中国已没有什么日俘了，美国帝国主义还有什么理由要把美军留在中国呢？杜鲁门是有“理由”的，他说：“协助军调部找阵亡美军尸体。”真是活见鬼！
    现在，美国帝国主义算是不打自招的告诉了我们，它在这一段时期搞的什么名堂：
    “在这一时期内，大部分由于我们在运输、武装和补给上给予他们（系指国民党反动政府）的部队援助，他们遂能推广其控制及于华北和东北大部分，直至马歇尔将军于一九四七年初离开中国的时候，国民党在军事成就和领土的扩张上是登峰造极的。”（艾契逊致杜鲁门原函）
    此后，如所周知，内战便大打起来，美援也潮水般的涌来。而魏德迈、麦克阿瑟之流，此后索性也就不说“找美军尸体”了，大嚷其“反对布尔塞维克的威胁”（？）；不过，大嚷“布尔塞维克威胁”的美国帝国主义，岂止威胁中国而已，而是囊括了国民党反动政府的统治区，变成国民党反动政府的太上皇了。
