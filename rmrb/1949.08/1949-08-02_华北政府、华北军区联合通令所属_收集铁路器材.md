    North China Government and North China Military Region Jointly Issue a Circular to Subordinates
    Collect Railway Materials
    [Reported by this newspaper] The North China People's Government and the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently jointly issued a circular to all levels of government and military regions to actively collect various transportation materials in accordance with the "Measures for Collecting and Protecting Railway Transportation Materials" formulated by the Ministry of Railways. The circular stated: In order to support the front lines, ensure the supply and transportation for the advancing armies, and develop the economy, it is necessary to quickly and massively repair railway transportation facilities. However, the most difficult problem currently encountered is the lack of materials, which cannot be manufactured in time, especially steel rails, which are the most important. In order to overcome difficulties and actively complete the task of rapidly repairing the entire railway transportation line, all soldiers and civilians should immediately assist the Railway Bureau in collecting all railway transportation materials preserved by the people, collected by public and private institutions, and circulating in the market, and hand them over to the Railway Bureau.
