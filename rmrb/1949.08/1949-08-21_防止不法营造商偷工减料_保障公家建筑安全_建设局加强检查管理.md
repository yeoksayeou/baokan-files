　　Ensuring the Safety of Public Buildings
　　Construction Bureau Strengthens Inspection and Management

　　[Report from this newspaper] Since the liberation of Beiping City, some public construction projects have been contracted to unregistered contractors due to the abuse of power by the responsible authorities, resulting in hasty designs and poor construction. The Municipal Construction Bureau sent personnel to various locations for inspection and discovered many violations of construction safety standards. For example, the construction projects of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, the People's Paper Mill, and the Yongdingmen Warehouse of the Trade Company were contracted to unregistered entities such as "Yida Construction Office" and "Zhongxing Xiangchen Construction Factory." Some newly built walls collapsed before completion; the sag of newly constructed reinforced concrete beams exceeded specifications, and some continuous reinforced concrete beams even cracked immediately after completion. The reasons for this can be summarized as follows: On the one hand, the authorities in charge of construction projects do not consider the purpose, strength, and safety of new buildings in their designs, and instead imitate old buildings; they also adopt non-public bidding methods, focusing only on the lowest bid regardless of whether the contractor is qualified; the authorities themselves lack architectural technical personnel and do not seek assistance from the Construction Bureau or engage qualified architects for design and inspection; when poor construction or potential dangers are discovered, strict rectification is not carried out in a timely manner, and the situation is accommodated as a fait accompli, allowing some unscrupulous construction companies to take the opportunity to deceive. On the other hand, the management of construction companies was not strict in the past. For example, "Yida Construction Office" and "Zhongxing Xiangchen Construction Factory" did not comply with the government's regulations on the registration of the construction industry and construction companies, and arbitrarily drew up plans and contracted projects for others, hoping to evade inspection by the Construction Bureau and evade taxes; they also took advantage of low bids to win projects and then cut corners. Some construction factories falsely exaggerated their business, used names such as "Construction Office," "Industrial Cooperative," and "Construction Group" instead of construction factory names to confuse the owners; and took advantage of the owners' unwillingness to spend money on architectural design, violating the regulations that private construction factories cannot design for owners, and privately drew up plans and contracted projects for owners. In order to avoid losses to the public, ensure safety, and protect the business of legitimate construction factories, all agencies, organizations, schools, etc., with construction projects must obtain a construction permit from the Construction Bureau and engage architectural experts for design; and employ construction factories with registered licenses for construction. In addition, the Construction Bureau has strengthened the management of construction factories and will conduct spot checks on the factories and the projects they undertake at any time. The government will impose penalties on those who cut corners or engage in deceptive behavior.

　　防止不法营造商偷工减料
  　保障公家建筑安全
    建设局加强检查管理
    【本报讯】北平市解放以来，某些公家建筑工程，因主管机关，滥用未经登记之营造商包做，以致设计草率，施工不良，经市建设局派员赴各处检查，发现违反建筑安全的现象很多。如华北农业机械总厂、人民造纸厂、贸易公司永定门仓库等的建筑工程，由未经登记的“一大工务所”、“中兴相臣营造厂”等包做，有的新建大墙尚未竣工即坍塌；新做钢筋混凝土大梁下垂超过规格，甚至有的钢筋混凝土连续梁刚做好就折裂了。总结其原因，一方面是由于建筑工程的主管机关对新建筑物的设计，不考虑它的用途、坚固和安全，仿造旧建筑物；同时采用不公开的方法投标，只知采用最低标而不管承包建筑商是否合格；本机关既无建筑技术人员，又不请建设局协助或延请合格建筑师设计检查；发现施工不良与出危险之后，又不及时予以严格纠正，迁就既成事实，以致使一些不法建筑厂商乘机进行蒙蔽欺骗。另一方面，是由于以前对建筑厂商管理不严格，如“一大工务所”、“中兴相臣营造厂”等，不履行政府规定的建筑业和营造业登记的法令，擅自代人绘图包工，希图逃避建设局检查与偷漏税收；并利用低标投得工程后，偷工减料。更有些营造厂，虚伪夸大业务，不用营造厂名义而用“工务所”、“工业社”、“建筑组合”等名称，混淆业主的视听；且利用业主不肯费钱请建筑师设计的机会，违反私营营造厂不能代业主设计的规定，私自代业主绘图和承揽工程。为避免公家损失及保障安全，并保护一般正当营造厂营业，凡各机关团体学校等如有建筑工程，务向建设局领取建筑执照，并请建筑专家设计；招用有登记执照之营造厂施工。另外建设局已加强管理营造厂，随时抽查各厂和所承办的工程，遇有偷工减料或欺骗行为者，政府决加以处分。
