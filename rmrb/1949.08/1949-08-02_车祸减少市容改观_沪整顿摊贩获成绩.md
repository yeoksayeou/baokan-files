    Traffic Accidents Reduced, City Appearance Improved
    Shanghai Achieves Success in Rectifying Street Vendors
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 31st] The Shanghai Municipal People's Government's work in rectifying street vendors has achieved significant results. After rectification, approximately 80,000 street vendors in the city have been initially organized, thereby improving traffic order and the appearance of the city, and greatly reducing vehicle accident incidents. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau began organizing street vendors on the third day after liberation, first promulgating the "Provisional Rules for the Management of Street Vendors," widely conducting propaganda and education for street vendors, and at the same time educating old police officers to change their past Kuomintang-era behavior of beating and scolding street vendors. As a result, most street vendors quickly organized themselves, forming groups in sections, democratically electing group leaders, and selecting representatives to participate in the management of street vendors in each public security sub-bureau, managing themselves. Each district also established street vendor patrol teams, with vendors from each group taking turns on duty. After this organization, the chaotic situation in the early days of liberation, where main roads in the urban area were filled with vendors, affecting traffic, was changed.

    车祸减少市容改观
    沪整顿摊贩获成绩
    【新华社上海三十一日电】沪人民政府整顿摊贩工作，已获得显著成绩。全市约八万摊贩经过整顿后，已初步组织起来，因而使交通秩序与市容改观，且大大地减少了车辆肇祸事件。沪市公安局于解放后第三天即着手进行摊贩的整理工作，首先颁布了“管理摊贩暂行规则”，广泛地向摊贩进行宣传教育，同时教育旧警员改变过去国民党时期对摊贩的打骂行为。因而大部摊贩都迅速地组织起来，分段组成小组，民主选举小组长，并选派代表参加各公安分局管理摊贩工作，自己管理自己。各区并成立了摊贩纠察队，由每组的摊贩轮流值勤。经过这样组织以后，就改变了解放初期市区要道摊贩充斥，影响交通的紊乱情形。
