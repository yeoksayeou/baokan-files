    Important Information for Pregnant Women
    Zeng Zhaoyi

    Based on several years of experience in obstetrics, to achieve the goal of maternal health care, the following points should be noted:
    (1) Have regular prenatal check-ups. In the first six months of pregnancy, a woman should be examined once a month, every two weeks in the seventh and eighth months, and every week in the ninth and tenth months. Under urban conditions, pregnant women can follow these rules. Prenatal check-ups are an important method of maternal health care, which can prevent many diseases and reduce maternal and child mortality rates. For example, measuring the pelvis and correcting fetal position at any time can eliminate or early recognize most dystocia. Measuring blood pressure and checking urine for protein are the main steps to prevent eclampsia. Checking blood can detect syphilis and anemia early so that treatment can be given immediately to avoid miscarriage, premature birth, and stillbirth (syphilis stillbirth accounts for more than 84%, and more than 95% of fetuses will be normal after treatment). Treatment of anemia can directly reduce the chance of bleeding and indirectly reduce the incidence of inflammation. Blood tests can also determine blood type to prepare for blood transfusions in case of bleeding, thus reducing deaths from bleeding. In addition, blood tests can also determine the Rh factor.
    (2) Pregnant women do not need to be afraid of pregnancy and childbirth. Pregnancy is a physiological phenomenon. People in cities, especially those who are westernized, regard childbirth as a major event, and they are very nervous from pregnancy to delivery. As a result, vomiting is very severe in early pregnancy, and dystocia often occurs during delivery. Anatomically speaking, the stimulation of the uterus is transmitted to the thalamus of the brain (the thalamus is the center of emotion, especially the center of fear), and then to the sympathetic nerve through the thalamus-cerebral cortex pathway, which causes the cervix to open. If the emotional center has too much influence, the cervix will not open but will spasm, resulting in dystocia. Therefore, if pregnant women are not afraid of pregnancy and childbirth, delivery will be easier. Pain relievers for childbirth have been continuously discovered. Soviet scholars have claimed that large amounts of Vitamin B can achieve this purpose. Major hospitals in large cities in China such as Beijing, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai also have some methods of pain relief or pain reduction. It is hoped that this area will develop further in the near future. Bearing and raising children is the natural duty of mothers. It is hoped that mothers will bravely undertake this great and proud duty and not be afraid.
    (3) Pregnant women should eat food high in vitamins and protein. The previous idea of a low-protein diet is incorrect. If there are eggs, you can eat up to six eggs a day. If not, you can eat more soybeans and all kinds of beans (soybeans and all kinds of beans contain a lot of protein, followed by sorghum). Green leafy vegetables contain large amounts of Vitamin A and C, and coarse rice contains Vitamin B, which is much better than refined rice and flour. Regular sun exposure can help the production of Vitamin D.
    Pregnant women should drink more than five to six pounds of water a day, because the ureter becomes loose and enlarged during pregnancy, and a small amount of urine is retained. Drinking more water will increase urination, reduce the chance of retention, and reduce the retention of bacteria, which will reduce the occurrence of common pyelonephritis.
    During the entire pregnancy, a pregnant woman's weight gain should be within 20 pounds, which is half a pound per week. If the increase is too small, eat more nutritious food. If the increase is too much, check for edema. Edema is a precursor to toxemia of pregnancy, and salt should be eaten less. Pregnant women without edema will not have swelling of the cervix, making it easier to open, and shortening the delivery time.
    (4) Pregnant women's clothing should be loose and comfortable. Some people like to wear tight abdominal belts, saying that they can prevent the fetus from growing too large, which is incorrect. The fetus will not become smaller by wearing an abdominal belt, but it will hinder its development. If the pregnant woman's belly is too loose, an abdominal belt can be used to support it from below, but not to tighten it. Round garters or tight socks that cause varicose veins should not be used. High heels can increase the chance of miscarriage and must be avoided.
    (5) Pregnant women's exercise should follow their usual habits. People who like to sit do not need to suddenly exercise vigorously; people who like to move can continue to do so, but avoid jumping and overly bumpy activities.
    (6) Pregnant women's bathing should also follow their usual habits. Do not take a bath in the last month of pregnancy, because water entering the vagina can cause inflammation. You can wipe yourself down or take a shower.
    (7) In early pregnancy, the uterus presses on the rectum, reducing bowel movements. In the late stage, because the baby's head descends, nine out of ten people will experience constipation and hemorrhoids. When constipated, you can eat more green vegetables and coarse grains, and go to the toilet at a fixed time every day. If it doesn't work, take some mineral oil such as petroleum.
    (8) Remove the dirt accumulated on the nipples with warm soapy water. If not washed, the skin under the dirt is very tender, and it is easy to break when the baby sucks milk in the future. If the nipples are inverted, pull them out with your fingers often, otherwise, the baby will not be able to eat milk after birth, which is the most painful thing.
    (9) In early pregnancy, too much and violent sexual intercourse is a major cause of miscarriage. Sexual intercourse in the last month of pregnancy can bring pathogenic bacteria into the vagina. It is best to avoid sexual intercourse in the first three months and the last three months of pregnancy.

    妊妇须知
    曾昭懿
    根据几年来从事产科的经验，为了达到妊妇保健的目的，应注意下列几点：
    （一）要有规律的产前检查。妊妇在起初六个月，每月应当检查一次，七、八个月每二星期查一次，九、十个月每一星期查一次。在城市的条件下，妊妇是可以遵守这规则的产前检查，是妊妇保健的重要方法，可以预防许多病及减少母子的死亡率。例如量骨盆和随时纠正胎位，可以免除或早期认识大部分的难产。量血压，查尿内蛋白质，就是预防抽疯病主要的步骤。查血，可以早期及发现梅毒，贫血，以便即时治疗，而避免小产早产和死产（梅毒死产占百分之八十四以上，治疗后百分之九十五以上的胎儿会正常）。贫血的治疗可直接减少流血的机会，间接减少发炎的病发率。又查血，可以决定血型以便万一出血时的输血准备，而减少出血死亡，此外查血还可知Ｒｈ素的决定。
    （二）妊妇对孕产不必惧怕。妊娠是一种生理现象。在城市的人，尤其欧美化的人，把生产看成天大的事，从有妊到生产，神经非常紧张，所以妊娠早期呕吐很利害，分娩时又常有难产。在解剖学上讲，子宫的刺激传到脑子的视丘（视丘是感情中心点尤其是惧怕中心），由视丘大脑灰白质路线，到交感神经，再让子宫口开大，如果感情中心影响过大，子宫口就不开反而痉挛，因之致成难产，所以妊妇对孕产不害怕，则生产时反而容易。分娩止痛药，已不断发现，苏联学者所谓大量乙种维他命会达到此目的。中国的大城市如平、津、京、沪各大医院，也有部分的止痛或减痛方法，在不久的将来，希望这一面有更大发展。生儿育女是母亲天职，希望母亲们对这一伟大而骄傲的天职，勇敢地承担，不要惧怕。
    （三）妊妇应当吃高维他命高蛋白质的饭。以前所谓低蛋白质饭是不对的。有鸡蛋的每日可以吃到六个鸡蛋。没有的话，可多吃大豆及一切豆类（大豆和一切豆类含蛋白质很多，高粱米次之）。绿叶菜有大量甲种和丙种维他命，粗米含乙种维他命，比机器米面强得多，常常晒太阳可以帮助丁种维他命的制造。
    妊妇每日应当喝五磅到六磅以上的水，因为妊娠时尿管松大，有小部分尿滞留，多饮水尿就多，滞留的机会少，细菌存留也较少，会减少常见的肾盂炎病的发生。
    妊妇经过全部妊娠期间，体重增加应在二十磅以内，就是每星期体重增加半磅，增加太少了，多吃点营养东西，增加多了，应查明有无水肿，水肿是妊娠毒血症的先兆，应当少吃盐。产妇没有水肿的，子宫口也不肿，容易开大，生产时间就缩短。
    （四）妊妇衣服应当轻松宽大，有些人喜欢紧束腹带，说省得胎儿长得太大，这是不对的。束腹胎儿也不会变小，反妨碍其发育。如产妇肚皮太松，可以用腹带从下兜住，而不是束紧。圆袜带或短袜太紧，使静脉怒张的，应当不用，高跟鞋能增加流产的机会，必需避免。
    （五）妊妇运动随平日习惯，喜欢坐的人，不必忽然大运动；喜欢动的人，仍可继续，但避免跳跃和过于颠动的行为。
    （六）妊妇沐浴也随平日习惯，妊娠最后月不要坐浴，因为水进阴道可以发炎，可以擦澡或淋浴。
    （七）妊娠初期子宫如压迫直肠、大便减少、末期因胎儿头下降，十个有九个会便秘和发生痔疮。大便秘结时，可以多吃青菜粗粮，每日有一定时间去大便，不行再吃点矿物油如石油之类。
    （八）乳头上有秽物堆积，用温肥皂水洗去，要不洗，秽物下的皮肤很嫩，将来小孩吮乳时容易破裂。乳头假使凹陷，用手指头常常牵出，否则小孩生下，吃不成奶，是最苦痛的事。
    （九）妊娠早期，太多和猛烈的性交，是引起流产的一大原因，妊娠最后一月性交，可把致病的细菌带入阴道，最好妊娠前三月及末三月均避免之。
