　　Preventing Encephalitis
  　Anti-Epidemic Committee Holds Emergency Meeting, Calls for Mosquito Swatting Campaign
　　[This Municipality News] Since the discovery of encephalitis in this city, the Municipal People's Anti-Epidemic Committee held a temporary emergency meeting yesterday (23rd) afternoon at the Municipal Health Bureau to discuss prevention measures and organizational division of labor, communication, and other issues. Fourteen representatives from relevant military, government, and civilian units attended the meeting, including representatives from the North China People's Government Health Department, the North China Military Region Health Department, the Municipal People's Government Health Bureau, the Civil Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Party Committee, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and experts from major hospitals. First, Director Zhang of the Municipal People's Government Health Bureau reported on the incidence of the disease in the city during July and August. According to preliminary investigations, there were a total of 67 patients, with a mortality rate of approximately 30%, distributed in urban and suburban areas. The Municipal Health Bureau has organized two prevention and disinfection teams in the urban area and instructed the nine suburban epidemic prevention stations to be responsible for the investigation, disinfection, and prevention of the disease. Subsequently, experts exchanged information on the condition and prevention methods of encephalitis, unanimously agreeing that although encephalitis is an infectious disease and there is currently no specific medicine, it is not incurable if diagnosed and treated early. The main source of transmission for this disease is mosquitoes, and all citizens should be mobilized to launch a mosquito-swatting campaign and thoroughly prevent their breeding by removing stagnant water and other methods. Once suspicious symptoms are detected, early diagnosis and treatment should be carried out. Finally, the following resolutions were made: (1) Use newspapers and public entertainment venues such as cinemas to conduct extensive publicity, introducing the disease and prevention methods to citizens. (2) Organizational division of labor: The Military Region Health Department, the North China People's Government Health Department, and the Municipal People's Government Health Bureau will each be responsible for different tasks. (3) The Municipal People's Government Health Bureau will collect relevant information.

　　预防大脑炎
  　防疫委会紧急会议号召展开捕蚊运动
    【本市讯】本市自发现大脑炎以来，市人民防疫委员会特于昨（二十三）日下午在市府卫生局召开临时紧急会议，商讨预防办法及组织分工、联系等问题。到会的有华北人民政府卫生部、华北军区卫生部、市人民政府卫生局、民政局、市委、全总等单位以及各大医院专家等军、政、民有关方面十四位代表。首由市人民政府卫生局张局长报告本市七八月份本病发生情况，据初步调查，共有六十七个患者，死亡率约占百分之三十强，分布于城区与郊区。市卫生局于城区组织了两个预防消毒小组，并责成郊区九个防疫站，分别担任对本病之调查及消毒预防工作。继由各专家交换大脑炎病情及预防方法，一致认为大脑炎虽是传染病，而现在还无特效药，如果及早诊断，及时治疗，不是不能治愈的病。本病主要传染物是蚊子，应号召全市市民展开捕蚊运动，并用除去脏水等方法彻底防止其繁殖，一旦发现可疑情况，应早期诊断并治疗。最后作了下面几项决议：（一）用报纸或影院等公共娱乐场所展开广泛宣传，向市民介绍病情及预防方法。（二）组织分工：由军区卫生部、华北人民政府卫生部与市人民政府卫生局分头负责。（三）由市人民政府卫生局收集有关情报。
