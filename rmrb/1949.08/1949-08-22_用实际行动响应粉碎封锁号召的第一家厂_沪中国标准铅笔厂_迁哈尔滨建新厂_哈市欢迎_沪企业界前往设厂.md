  　Shanghai Businesses to Establish Factories
    [Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station, 21st Broadcast] Shanghai News: In response to the call to smash the enemy's blockade, the China Standard Pencil Factory has decided to move half of its existing machinery to Harbin to establish a new factory. This is the first factory in the city's industrial sector to respond to the government's six major calls with practical action. Regarding the funding issue, Harbin Enterprise Company will contribute 60%, and China Standard Pencil Factory will contribute 40%. The former is responsible for preparing the factory building and planning operations, while the latter supplies the machinery and is responsible for the technology. Yang Zhuming and Wu Gengmei will serve as the director and deputy director of the new company's preparatory committee, respectively. It is expected that the factory construction will be completed within six months, and formal delivery will begin, reaching a production plan of 10,000 gross per month. The relocation of the factory has received enthusiastic support from the factory's employees. The deputy section chief of the engineering department said: I have long wanted to go to the old liberated areas to study, and now my wish has come true. Luo Jihua, a worker in the repair department, said: In the past, our country's pencil industry relied on foreign countries for raw materials. Now that I see an independent pencil factory about to be established, I am willing to dedicate myself to it. Zhang Yunshu, a worker in the product department, said humorously: I am willing to dedicate myself to production and marry the machines. There are more than a dozen employees going north, most of whom are technical workers. The treatment remains the same as their original positions and salaries. The factory is responsible for the travel expenses and family allowances for the journey north. They are now awaiting orders.
    [Another News] Yang Zhuming, General Manager of Harbin Enterprise Company, telegraphed China Standard Pencil Factory, stating: If Shanghai's modernized equipment for sack factories, egg-beating factories, or other factories that primarily use soybeans or timber as raw materials, are willing to invest in the Northeast, we will sincerely welcome them to cooperate in Harbin; if they wish to operate independently, we are also willing to provide our utmost assistance.

  　沪企业界前往设厂
    【上海人民广播电台二十一日广播】上海消息：中国标准铅笔厂响应粉碎敌人封锁的号召，决定将该厂现有机器之半数迁往哈尔滨建立新厂。这是本市产业界以实际行动响应人民政府六大号召的第一家厂。关于资金问题，哈尔滨企业公司出百分之六十，中国标准铅笔厂出百分之四十。前者负责筹备厂房，谋划业务，后者供应机器，负责技术，且由杨祝民和吴羹梅分任新公司的正副筹备主任，预计半年内可完成建厂，正式出货，达到每月一万罗的生产计划。中国标准铅笔厂在两个星期内完成了机器拆卸和装箱工作，十八日已交上海铁路局代运。这次迁厂的行动，得到了该厂职工的热烈支持。工务科副科长说：我早就想到老解放区去学习一下，现在如愿以偿了。修理部工友罗继华说：我国铅笔工业过去原料依靠外国，现在看到有一个独立的铅笔工厂将要成立，我愿意献身于它。产品部工友张云书诙谐的说：我愿献身生产与机器结婚。北上的职工，共有十多人，多数为技术工，待遇方面仍照原职原薪。至于北上路费及家眷津贴都由厂方负责。他们现在待命行动。
    【又讯】哈尔滨企业公司总经理杨祝民致电中国标准铅笔厂，表示：上海近代化设备之麻袋工厂、打蛋工厂或以大豆、木材为主要原料的其他工厂，如愿投资东北，将竭诚欢迎去哈合作；如欲独资经营，亦愿竭力协助。
