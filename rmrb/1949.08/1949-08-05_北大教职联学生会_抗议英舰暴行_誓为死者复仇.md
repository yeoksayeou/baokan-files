    Protest British Warship Atrocity
    Vow to Avenge the Dead
    [Report from this newspaper] The Peking University Faculty and Staff Union Preparatory Committee and Student Union, upon hearing of the British warship HMS Amethyst's atrocity, jointly issued a statement yesterday (4th), demanding punishment for the crimes of the HMS Amethyst, and vowing to avenge the sacrifices. It stated, in brief: "The Chinese people will never forgive the two barbaric atrocities of the British warship HMS Amethyst. We must continue to pursue its responsibility. We must solemnly warn British imperialism not to rush to celebrate the success of the HMS Amethyst's shameless escape. Unless your government punishes the murderers, apologizes, and provides compensation for the aforementioned crimes, the Chinese people will never agree. Our entire Chinese military and civilians must avenge the sacrifices."
