　　The Art World Embarks on a New Path
　　Ji Qing

　　"If the content of performing arts isn't reformed, there's a risk of being eliminated!" The art world experienced the truth of this statement from real life. It happened after the "May Day" holiday when Gu Rongfu and others were invited to perform at a paper mill. They went with the intention of entertaining the workers, confident that the programs they had prepared would be well-received. The first program was a two-person comic act, and as they were in the middle of a heated, exaggerated argument, a worker came up and said that they would prefer they not continue, that they would rather pay for the show and not watch it. Later, they heard the workers' comments: "This doesn't benefit our production, and it's not educational..." Afterwards, they were troubled by this unprecedented blow, and after several days of reflection and discussion with their colleagues, they finally concluded: "Performing arts should now play a role in educating the people. If we don't keep up with the progress of the people, we will be abandoned. Now the workers have progressed, and in the future, the citizens will also progress. If we continue to sing old songs and refuse to change, we will definitely be in danger of being eliminated!" Therefore, they and others called upon many people to write new lyrics that would inspire the people's struggle and production. Later, they continuously performed programs with new content at the Xidan Amusement Park and other places. As a result, three consecutive performances were sold out, with more audience members than ever before. On the fourth day, the Education Bureau booked their show, and the remaining seats were also sold out. Gu Rongfu said happily: "Not even my ancestors ever had a show booked like this!"

　　Having learned the new lyrics, but not understanding their meaning, they would sometimes say things wrong without even realizing it. Someone said, "The house is built, but the doors and windows are not yet installed!" Without study, it won't work. Hou Baolin asked to study at Hua University, but his colleagues objected: "If only you progress, what about the rest of us? Can we all go to Hua University?" So, they requested that a training class be opened. The members of the Performing Arts Association eagerly participated in the training class.

　　Currently, the majority of the twenty-one major troupes in the art world are performing new content, with over two hundred and thirty performances. Among them, twenty-six better programs, focusing on mass production, crossing the Wujiang River during the 25,000-li Long March, "Ten Daughters Praising Their Husbands" (production), and "Marriage and Superstition" are the most popular.

　　Now, the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station has decided to have the Performing Arts Association take over a thirty-minute program every day starting from September 1st, and everyone is strengthening their study of new lyrics even more.

　　曲艺界走上新道路
    纪清
    “曲艺内容不加改造，就有被淘汰的危险!”曲艺界从实际生活中体会到这句话。那是在“五一”以后，顾荣甫等被某造纸厂请去演唱，他们抱着给人家娱乐的心情去了，自己估计准备的节目人家一定很喜欢，头一个节目就演了一个双簧，彼此谩骂得正兴奋的时候，上去了一个工人说，希望不要再演下去了，他们宁愿白付钱，不看戏。后来他们听到了工人们的反映：“这个对咱生产又没有好处，也没有教育意义……”回去，他们为平生第一次受到的打击苦恼着，经过几天的深思，和同业人们研究，最后肯定：“曲艺今后应当起教育人民的作用，跟不上老百姓进步，就要被人家抛弃。现在工人进步了，将来市民也进步了，如果仍然唱旧词，坚持不改，一定就有被淘汰的危险！”于是他们几个人号召许多人都来编写鼓舞人民斗争与生产的新词，以后他们连续在西单游艺社等处上演新内容的节目，结果，三场连续满座，从来没有过那么多的观众。第四天，教育局还包了他们的戏，剩下的位子也都卖光了。顾荣甫高兴地说：“从我祖宗起，也没有包过座啊！”
    学会了新词，但是不明白它的意义，有时说错自己也不知道。有人说：“房子盖好，门窗还安不好！”不学习不成，侯宝林要求去华大学习，但同人们反对：“只你进步，大家就别进步，还能都去华大？”于是要求开了讲习班，讲习班参加人数以曲艺公会参加人最为踊跃。
    现在，曲艺界主要的二十一个社，大多数演唱新内容，演出二百三十多次，其中二十六个较好的节目，以大生产、两万五千里长征中渡乌江，十女夸夫（生产）、“婚姻与迷信”最受欢迎。
    现在北平人民广播电台已决定从九月一号起每天由曲艺公会担任三十分钟节目，大家更加强学新词了。
