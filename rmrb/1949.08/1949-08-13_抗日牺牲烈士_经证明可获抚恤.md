    Anti-Japanese War Martyrs
    Whose Sacrifice is Proven Can Receive Pensions
    To the Editor:
    My uncle was a Communist Party member who was captured by the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance Against Japan. He remained unyielding before his execution and was brutally murdered by the enemy. After his death, only his elderly grandparents and aunt were left in the family, struggling through difficult times. Although the family owns twenty-one mu of land, they have no ability to cultivate it, and the village has never provided substitute cultivation. I would like to ask you to answer the following questions:
    1. Does the pension for martyrs' families promulgated by the former North China People's Government apply equally to the families of Anti-Japanese War martyrs as to the families of martyrs who died in the People's Liberation War?
    2. If possible, where can they be claimed?
        (Zhao Zonglin)
    Mr. Zhao Zonglin:
    The reply to your questions from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau is as follows:
    (1) If the deceased participated in the revolutionary ranks and sacrificed his life in the Anti-Japanese War, and the family has obtained proof from the county-level government or above, his family can enjoy the treatment of a martyr's family, which is the same as the treatment of martyrs who sacrificed in the Liberation War.
    (2) If the status of a martyr's family has been obtained, they can take the certificate to the local county government to receive the pension and enjoy the preferential treatment for martyrs' families.

    抗日牺牲烈士
    经证明可获抚恤
    编者同志：
    我伯父是个共产党员，在抗日战争时曾被日寇抓去，临刑不屈，被敌人残害。他死后家中只剩下年老祖父母与伯母，在苦难日子里挣扎。家中虽有田二十一亩，丝毫无有生产能力，而村中始终无代耕。下面问题请先生解答：
    一、以前华北人民政府所颁布的烈属抚恤金，抗日烈属是否与人民解放战中烈属同享此项优待权利？
    二、如可能时到何处去领？
        （赵宗林）
    赵宗林先生：
    你的问题承北平市人民政府民政局答复如下：
    （一）如系参加革命阵营，因抗日牺牲，已在县以上政府取得证明时，其家属可以享受烈属待遇，与解放战争中牺牲的烈士待遇相同。
    （二）如已取得烈属地位，可持具证明文件到所在地县政府领取抚恤金，并可享受烈属优待。
