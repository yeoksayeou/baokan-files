To Generals Peng Dehuai, Zhang Zongxun, and Zhao Shoushan of the First Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; Generals Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhang Jichun of the Second Field Army; Generals Chen Yi, Rao Shushi, Su Yu, and Tan Zhenlin of the Third Field Army; Generals Lin Biao, Luo Ronghuan, and Deng Zihui of the Fourth Field Army; and to all commanders and fighters of each field army:

　　Thanks to your bloodshed, sacrifice, and heroic struggle, two million people in Beiping and more than half of our compatriots have been happily liberated from the heinous rule of the US-Chiang reactionaries. Now, braving the sweltering heat and overcoming hardships, you are advancing into South China, Southwest China, and Northwest China. In order to liberate all the Chinese people, you are sweeping away the remnant forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries with the mighty force of a whirlwind sweeping away fallen leaves. National victory is just around the corner. We, the people of Beiping, are united in our willingness to develop production, build a new Beiping, consolidate the fruits of revolutionary victory, and fight to support your operations at the front! As the representatives' conference is being held, we would like to extend our heartfelt greetings and respect to you on behalf of the two million people of Beiping!

Respectfully,
Beiping Municipal People's Representatives' Conference
