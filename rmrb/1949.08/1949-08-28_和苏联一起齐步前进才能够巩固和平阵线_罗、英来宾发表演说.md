The Chairman of the Presidium of the Romanian People's Republic, Parhon, mentioned in his speech the Romanian working people's love for the Soviet people, Soviet culture, and the great teacher of all nationalities, Stalin. He said: Our people know that only by marching in step with the Soviet Union and the brotherly people's democratic countries can we build a better life and consolidate the front fighting for peace and freedom.

　　The last speaker was the Vice-Dean of Canterbury, Johnson. He said: We came here to assure you that you are not alone in the struggle for peace and a happy life.

    会上也有来宾发言，罗马尼亚人民共和国议会主席团主席巴洪在发言中说到罗马尼亚劳动人民对苏维埃人民、苏维埃文化和各族人民的伟大导师斯大林的热爱。他说：我们的人民知道，只有和苏联与人民民主的兄弟国齐步前进，才可能建立美好的生活，巩固为和平与自由而斗争的阵线。
    最后一位发言的是坎特伯雷副主教约翰逊。他说：我们到这儿来，是为了向你们保证，在争取和平与幸福生活的斗争中，你们不是孤独的。（鼓掌）他又说：一个富有魔力的字眼斯大林格勒，深深地铭刻在英国工人阶级的心上。我不相信我们人民会进行反对苏联的战争。我到这里来和各位同志一起争取和平，我感到莫大的光荣。我们亲眼看到了全世界争取和平的战士的主力，我们坚信：在争取全人类兄弟友谊的斗争中，你们和我们将获得最后胜利。我们回国以后将努力促进和平的事业。
