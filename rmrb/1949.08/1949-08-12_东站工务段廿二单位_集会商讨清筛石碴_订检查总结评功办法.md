East Station Engineering Section's 22 Units
Gather to Discuss Clearing and Screening Ballast
Establish Inspection, Summary, and Merit Evaluation Methods
[This Newspaper's Report] In order to further promote the clearing and screening of ballast movement, the Beijing East Station Engineering Section convened a joint meeting of units in the Qianmen District at 2:00 PM on the 10th of this month at the section's Production and Savings Merit Committee. A total of thirty-six people attended, representing twenty-two units including the Locomotive Section. The following was decided: (1) Completion Date: Due to differences in the number of personnel and tools, as well as business considerations, it is impossible to stipulate a unified date; each unit should complete the task as early as possible according to its own completion date. (2) Inspection Team: Each unit should elect one person to form an inspection committee, and elect a leader and deputy leader. (3) Merit evaluation standards and reward measures: The Engineering Section will first formulate methods based on the principles stipulated by the Railway Administration; each unit will then go back and discuss these methods in groups, submit opinions to the Engineering Section, and then the inspection team will convene a special meeting at 8:00 AM on the 13th to discuss them. The inspection committee members will also serve as merit evaluation committee members. In addition, the content of the summary report was also specified.
