　　Neglects Protecting State Property; Warehouse Suffers Losses Due to Rain; Conduct Ideological Examination in Conjunction with Studying Xinhua News Agency Short Commentary

　　[Taiyuan News] The Yangquan branch of the Taiyuan Trading Company neglected the protection of the people's state property, causing significant losses when rice and flour in the warehouse were soaked by rain. In late June, the Yangquan Company transported 240,000 jin of white flour and 60,000 jin of rice from Taiyuan, and over 10,000 jin of hemp skins from Heshun. At the time, because there was not enough space inside the warehouse, they were placed on a platform in the courtyard (two and a half feet high, nine zhang long, and three zhang wide) and under the west room. The covering technique was poor, and they were soaked by rain on the night of July 2nd. Although an inspection was carried out on the 3rd, rescue efforts were not promptly organized. It was not until the 4th that mobilization for drying began, but no efforts were made to find ways to properly handle the materials. They were still placed in living quarters and crammed into other houses. As a result of continued rain, 900 bags of white flour were damaged, with an average loss of one jin ten liang per bag. Four hundred bags of rice were damaged, including 200 jin completely ruined and 1,500 jin with a foul odor. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-seven jin of hemp skins were soaked, with 2,000 jin ruined and unusable for spinning rope. The above losses, including the cost of hiring workers to dry the materials, amounted to an estimated loss equivalent to 5,000 jin of millet. The cause of this loss was partly due to the lack of a suitable warehouse, but mainly because the Yangquan branch did not attach enough importance to the protection of state property. Beforehand, the Yangquan branch had not made the greatest efforts and preparations for storing and protecting against rain. During the rain, it did not promptly organize rescue efforts, and after the rain, it did not properly handle the soaked materials (such as quickly distributing them to various government agencies for consumption, which could have reduced some losses). As a result, the state property suffered such a significant loss. Due to unclear thinking, some trade cadres even mistakenly believed after the incident that "losses are inevitable without a warehouse" and "there's nothing that can be done about the losses." This kind of irresponsible, objectivist thinking is extremely harmful to the revolutionary cause and the protection of the people's state property. This kind of thinking has been severely criticized. The Taiyuan Trading Company has issued a special notice to all branches and sub-companies: (1) Immediately launch an education campaign among all trade cadres to cherish and protect the property of the people's motherland. Irresponsible and erroneous attitudes must be promptly criticized and corrected to ensure that similar losses do not occur in the future. (2) In accordance with the "China Trade" instructions on building and repairing warehouses, warehouse work must be done well, and rain protection techniques must be learned from all sources. (3) In accordance with the spirit of this instruction and in connection with the Xinhua News Agency's June 25th short commentary "Protect the Property of the People's Motherland," a comprehensive ideological examination should be conducted, from managers to cleaning staff, to establish a proactive attitude of protecting state property in thought.

　　阳泉贸易公司
  　忽视保护国家财产仓库被雨遭受损失
    结合学习新华社短评进行思想检查
    【太原讯】太原市贸易公司阳泉分公司，忽视保护人民国家财产，仓库米面被雨淋湿，造成重大损失。阳泉公司于六月下旬，由太原运回白面二十四万斤，大米六万斤，由和顺运回麻皮一万余斤，当时因库内放不下，放于院内的台上（高二尺半、长九丈、宽三丈）和西房下，掩盖技术不好，七月二日夜下雨浸湿，三日虽经检查，但未及时抢救，到四日方才动员翻晒，但又不多方想办法处理，仍放到住室和紧缩在其他房子内，因继续下雨，以致损坏白面九百袋，平均每袋损失一斤十两，大米四百袋，其中已全坏者二百斤，有坏气味者一千五百斤，麻皮被淋湿二千三百三十七斤，已坏不能纺绳者二千斤，以上损失连雇工翻晒，约计损失合小米五千斤。造成这次损失的原因，没有适当仓库固为原因之一，但主要由于阳泉分公司，对保护国家财产不够重视。事先阳泉分公司，对存放及防雨既没有做到最大的努力与准备，下雨当中又没有及时组织抢救，雨后没有对淋湿物资进行妥善处理（如迅速经过政府分售各机关食用，可减少一部损失），因而使国家财产遭受如此重大损失。由于思想上不明确，当事情发生后，有的贸易干部，还错误地认为“没有仓库遭受损失是不可避免的”，“损失了有啥办法”，这种推卸责任的客观主义思想，大有害于革命事业和对人民国家财产的保护。此种思想已受到严厉的批判。太原市贸易公司特为此发出通报，号召各分、支公司：（一）要立即在全体贸易干部当中，展开珍视和保护人民祖国财产的教育。不负责任的错误态度，迅速加以批评纠正，保证今后不再发生类似的损失。（二）要根据“华贸”建库、修库的指示，把仓库工作搞好，并向各方面学习防雨技术。（三）要根据这次指示的精神，联系新华社六月二十五日短评“保护人民祖国的财产”，由经理到勤杂人员，普遍进行一次思想检查，在思想上树立起保护国家财产的积极性。
