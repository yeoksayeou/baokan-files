  　A Certain Division Fully Mobilizes to Repair Ancient City Moats and Holes
    [Reported by this newspaper] To repair the wounds on the historical city of Beiping, a certain division of the North China Military Region began yesterday (20th) to fully mobilize and fill the trenches and holes in the city walls. Before liberation, the Kuomintang army, attempting to make a last-ditch struggle, forcibly conscripted laborers to build fortifications on the city walls, digging trenches of more than 23,000 cubic meters and more than 500 holes in the city walls, leaving the ancient city scarred. After receiving the glorious task of repairing the ancient city on the 18th, a certain division of the People's Liberation Army immediately held mobilization meetings in each regiment, and the soldiers challenged each other to earn merit. At four o'clock yesterday morning, units poured onto the city walls, pulling out weeds half a person tall, cutting down thorns, leveling earth, demolishing fortifications, laying bricks... When tools were insufficient, some soldiers used their hands, and they refused to rest even when their hands were worn. The mortar company and regimental staff of the 624th Regiment, a total of 130 people, demolished a fortification more than 60 meters long and more than one zhang high on the Chaoyangmen tower in five hours. The deputy company commander worked barefoot, and the cultural instructor wore out his hands. The soldiers shouted to keep up with the cadres. When everyone went back to eat, the squad leader of the squad left to guard the tools continued to work alone, his clothes soaked with sweat, and the deputy regimental commander told him to rest, but he would not stop. The first platoon of the third battalion of the 622nd Regiment also demolished a fortification 12 meters long, 8 meters wide, and more than 1 meter high in 40 minutes; the machine gun company completed the work originally planned for one day in half a day. The guards and drama troupe of the division headquarters performed Yangko dances from Dongzhimen to Qianmen; the propaganda teams of each regiment compiled clappers and rhymes to stir up everyone's enthusiasm. Some companies brought their own gongs and drums, and performed Yangko dances during breaks, and everyone was boiling with working enthusiasm. The task expected to be completed in five days for the entire city, some units completed one-third of it in one morning.

  　某师全体动员修复古城濠洞
    【本报讯】为了修复北平历史古城上的创伤，华北军区某师昨（二十）日起全体动员填补城墙上的壕沟、漏洞。解放前，国民党军希图作垂死挣扎，曾强征民工在城墙上修筑了工事，挖壕沟约两万三千余立方公尺，挖城墙洞五百多个，使古城创痕累累。解放军某师于十八日接到担任修复古城的这一光荣任务，马上各团召开了动员大会，战士们挑战争取立功。昨晨四时，各单位便涌上了城头，拔去半人高的野草，斩掉荆棘，平土、拆工事、铺砖……。工具不够，有的战士就用手拔，手磨破了还不肯休息。六二四团直属队迫击炮连和团部工作人员共一百三十人，五个钟头就把朝阳门楼上一个六十多米长、一丈多高的工事拆掉了，副连长光着脚干，文化教员磨破了手，战士们喊着向干部看齐。大家回去吃饭时，留下看工具的一班班长一个人继续干，衣服湿透了，副团长叫他休息他还不停止。六二二团三营一排也在四十分钟里拆完了十二米长、八米阔、一米多高的工事；机枪连原计划一天的工作，半天便完成了。师部卫士剧团扭着秧歌，从东直门到前门；各团的宣传队编出了快板和顺口溜，鼓起大家的热劲。有的连自己带着锣鼓，休息时就扭起秧歌来，大家沸腾在工作的热情里。全城预计五天完成的任务，一个上午，有的单位就完成三分之一。
