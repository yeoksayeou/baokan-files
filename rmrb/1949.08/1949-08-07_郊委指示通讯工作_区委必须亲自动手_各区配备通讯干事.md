    【This Newspaper Despatch】 The Suburban Work Committee of the CCP Beiping Municipal Committee issued instructions on suburban communications and reporting work on the 4th. It stipulates that district committees must personally write articles and vigorously organize and cultivate cadres, workers, students, and farmers to write articles. The instructions require each district committee to equip itself with communications cadres before August 10th and report to the Suburban Committee. It also requires that correspondents live up to their name. According to current statistics, among the 291 correspondents in 49 communication groups in the eight districts of the suburbs, only 114 have written articles. Therefore, establishing new communication organizations with a focus should be the current urgent task of the propaganda departments of each district. From now on, correspondents must write more than two articles per month to be worthy of the name. The instructions briefly explained the need to implement the idea of the whole party running the newspaper, and made regulations on the rights and obligations of communication cadres and the review system.

    郊委指示通讯工作
    区委必须亲自动手
    各区配备通讯干事
    【本报讯】中共北平市委会郊区工作委员会，于四日发出关于郊区通讯报导工作的指示。规定各区区委必须亲自写稿，更须大力组织培养干部、工人、学生、农民写稿。指示限各区区委于八月十日前配备好通讯干事，报告郊委。并要求通讯员须名符其实。因为据现在统计，郊区八个区四十九个通讯组、二百九十一名通讯员中，写过稿的只有一百一十四人。因此，有重点地建立新的通讯组织，应作为各区宣传部的当前迫切任务。而今后通讯员则必须每月写稿两篇以上，以作到有名有实。指示简要的说明了必须贯彻全党办报思想，并对通讯干事的权利与义务、审稿等制度作了规定。
