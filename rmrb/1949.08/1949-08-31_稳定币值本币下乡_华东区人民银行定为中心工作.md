Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 29th: The East China Branch of the People's Bank of China held a meeting of branch managers in Shanghai on July 21st, which concluded on August 17th. The meeting began with reports from each branch on business and local financial conditions, followed by group discussions, and finally a summary. The meeting determined that the central task for this autumn is to stabilize the currency, and to ensure that currency reaches the countryside when agricultural products are marketed. For agricultural loans in newly liberated areas, the focus will be on understanding the situation, first conducting typical trial loans to gain experience, in order to propose a comprehensive plan for spring loans next year. Remittance services should be prompt and convenient to promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. Each branch must formulate business and financial plans and strictly implement the system of requesting instructions and reporting. Some of the former staff from banks taken over in Shanghai will be assigned to work in the countryside. Each branch should take good care of them and help them improve their political understanding.
