Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 20th. The First Congress of the Northeast China-Soviet Friendship Association sent a telegram to Marshal Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. The text of the telegram is as follows:

To Marshal Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union:

As all the people of Northeast China commemorate the historically significant fourth anniversary of "August 15th" and warmly welcome the newly signed trade agreement between Northeast China and the Soviet Union, we are holding the first Congress of the Northeast China-Soviet Friendship Association. The delegates unanimously express their highest respect and gratitude to you and the Soviet people under your leadership for the consistent friendship and assistance given to the Chinese people, especially the great historical contribution of the Soviet Army in directly liberating Northeast China four years ago. At the same time, we are pleased that the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, have achieved a basic victory, and the National People's Democratic United Government is about to be born. As the Soviet poet Aliyev said, "Now no one and nothing can stop us from openly expressing our mutual love." Yes, we vow to strengthen and consolidate the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, to smash the sabotage conspiracies of imperialism and domestic reactionaries and all their divisive acts, and to wage an unyielding struggle to defend peace in the Far East. We firmly believe that under your correct leadership, lasting world peace and people's democracy will surely succeed. We respectfully wish you good health.

The First Congress of the Northeast China-Soviet Friendship Association bows in respect.

August 17, 1949
