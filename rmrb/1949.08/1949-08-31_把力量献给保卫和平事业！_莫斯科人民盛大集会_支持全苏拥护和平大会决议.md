　　Dedicate Our Strength to the Cause of Defending Peace!
    Grand Rally of Moscow People
  　Supports the Resolutions of the All-Soviet Union Peace Conference
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th] According to TASS, Moscow: A mass rally of 45,000 people was held here at the Central Cultural Recreation Park on the 27th, enthusiastically supporting the resolutions of the All-Soviet Union Peace Conference. The rostrum was decorated with flowers and a huge portrait of Comrade Stalin. "Under the banner of Lenin, under the leadership of Stalin, advance towards the victory of Communism!" These words appeared strikingly on crimson banners. When the masses elected the CPSU Central Committee Politburo headed by Comrade Stalin as the honorary presidium, the whole venue resounded with stormy applause, shouting: "Long live our Stalin!"
    Stalin Prize laureate and workshop director of the Stalin Automobile Factory, Davilingfu, spoke first, representing workers, foremen, engineers, technicians, and other staff of Moscow enterprises, expressing full support for the "Letter to the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Advocates of Peace and Peace Advocates of All Countries" issued by the All-Soviet Union Peace Conference, because it expresses the voices, emotions, will, and determination of the Soviet people.
    Vice Chairman of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, Gagalieva, spoke on behalf of Soviet women, saying: The women of the Soviet country – mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters – are fully determined to contribute their strength to the cause of striving for peace and opposing war.
    Czech representative and journalist Fucik said: The Czechoslovak people sincerely love the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union is the first in the world to eliminate the factors of war and the system of exploitation of man by man, because the Soviet Union built socialism, because the Soviet Union heroically and selflessly liberated our country and many countries in Europe from fascist barbarism.
　　The Socialist Edifice Is Increasingly Consolidated and the Forces of Peace Are Becoming Stronger
　　French Writer Rafeld Addresses the Assembly
    Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Advocates of Peace and French writer John Rafeld said: We are moved by the situation of the All-Soviet Union Peace Conference. This is a grand demonstration in which 200 million Soviet people, through 1,200 representatives, declare to the whole world their will to uphold peace. We foreign guests have gained the conviction from this noble humanitarian action: due to the consolidation of the socialist edifice as the foundation of peace, due to its strength and its victory, the forces of peace are stronger than the forces of war. I convey with deep emotion the gratitude and love of the French people to you.
    The next speaker was Nanni, a member of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Advocates of Peace, General Secretary of the Italian Socialist Party, and a member of the Italian Parliament. He said: I spoke on behalf of the Italian delegation at the All-Soviet Union Peace Conference, and now, I repeat to you, the working people of Moscow: although the Italian ruling class has signed the Atlantic Pact, a military treaty is just a piece of paper if it has not been signed and approved by the people.
    The masses participating in the conference unanimously passed a resolution fully supporting the "Letter to the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Advocates of Peace and Peace Advocates of All Countries" from the All-Soviet Union Peace Conference. The conference also passed a telegram of tribute to Comrade Stalin, the leader of the Soviet people.

　　把力量献给保卫和平事业！
    莫斯科人民盛大集会
  　支持全苏拥护和平大会决议
    【新华社北平三十日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：此间中央文化休息公园于二十七日举行四万五千人的群众大会，热烈支持全苏拥护和平大会的决议。主席台上饰着鲜花和斯大林同志的巨幅画像。“在列宁的旗帜下，在斯大林的领导下，向共产主义的胜利前进！”这些字句引人注目地出现在绯红色的旗帜上。当群众选举了以斯大林同志为首的联共中央政治局为荣誉主席团时，全场响起暴风雨般的鼓掌。高呼：“我们的斯大林万岁！”
    斯大林奖金获得者，斯大林汽车工厂车间主任达维灵夫首先发言，代表莫斯科各企业的工人、领班、工程师、技师和其他职员，表示完全支持全苏拥护和平大会所发出的“告世界拥护和平大会常设委员会与世界各国和平拥护者书”，因为该书表达着苏联人民的呼声、情绪、意志和决心。
    苏联妇女反法西斯委员会副主席嘉嘉列娜代表苏联妇女发言说：苏维埃国家的妇女——母亲、妻子、姊妹与女儿们，完全有决心把她们的力量贡献给争取和平与反对战争的事业。
    捷克代表、新闻记者福西克说：捷克斯洛伐克人民真诚地热爱着苏联，因为苏联是世界上头一个消除战争的因素和人对人的剥削制度，因为苏联建设了社会主义，因为苏联曾英勇忘我地把我国与欧洲许多国从法西斯野蛮统治下解放出来。
　　社会主义大厦日益巩固和平的力量愈来愈强大
　　法作家拉斐德向大会致词
    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会秘书长、法国作家约翰·拉斐德说：我们被全苏拥护和平大会的情况感动了。这是盛大的示威，在这个示威里，二万万苏联人民通过一千二百名代表向全世界宣告他们拥护和平的意志。我们外国来宾从这一高尚人道主义的行动中，得到这样的信念：由于作为和平基础的社会主义大厦的巩固，由于它的力量和它的胜利，和平的力量便比战争的力量更为强大。我以深厚的感情来转达法国人民对你们的感激与热爱。
    接着演说的，是世界拥护和平大会常设委员会委员、意大利社会党总书记和意国会议员南尼。他说：我曾代表意大利代表团，在全苏拥护和平大会上讲话，而现在，我对你们莫斯科的劳动人民重复着说：尽管意大利统治阶级在大西洋公约上签了字，但是，军事条约如果未经人民签字认可，只不过是一张纸。
    参加大会的群众一致通过决议，完全支持全苏拥护和平大会的“告世界拥护和平大会常设委员会与世界各国和平拥护者书”。大会并通过向苏联人民的领袖斯大林同志的致敬电。
