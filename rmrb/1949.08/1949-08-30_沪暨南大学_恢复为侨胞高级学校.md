　　Shanghai Jinan University
  　Reverted to a Senior School for Overseas Chinese
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th] The Shanghai Military Control Commission issued an order on the 19th to restore Jinan University as a senior school for educating children of overseas Chinese and training cadres for overseas Chinese affairs. Existing students who meet the above conditions and wish to continue studying at the school will be allowed to stay; the rest, belonging to the various departments of the Faculties of Arts, Law, and Commerce, will be merged into the corresponding faculties of Fudan University; those belonging to the various departments of the Faculty of Science will be merged into the same departments of Jiaotong University. All faculty and staff will be resettled with consideration for their work and life, and with the principle of maintaining their original positions and salaries as much as possible. Note: Jinan University was originally established to facilitate overseas Chinese children returning to China for their studies, and has always had a tradition of loving the country and freedom. After the Kuomintang reactionaries took control of the school, they fostered a large number of special agents, persecuted patriotic students and progressive professors, and completely disregarded the interests of overseas Chinese students. The proportion of overseas Chinese students gradually decreased. The restoration of the school as the highest institution of learning for overseas Chinese will play a significant role in cultivating overseas Chinese children to participate in the construction of the motherland.

　　沪暨南大学
  　恢复为侨胞高级学校
    【新华社上海二十九日电】上海军管会十九日命令将暨南大学恢复为教育华侨子弟和培养华侨工作干部的高级学校。原有学生凡合于上述条件而愿继续留校者，准许留校学习；其余属于文、法、商三院各系者，合并到复旦大学的相同院系；属于理学院各系者，合并到交通大学的同系。对于所有教职员工人则在照顾工作和生活并尽可能保持原职原薪的原则下，分别安置。按：暨南大学原来是为了海外华侨子弟回国求学方便才设立的，向来有爱国家爱自由的传统，国民党反动派控制该校后，豢养大批特务，迫害爱国学生和进步教授，完全不顾侨生利益，华侨学生比例数就逐步减少。该校的恢复为华侨最高学府，对于培植海外侨胞子弟参加祖国的建设事业，将有很大的作用。
