    In Memory of Mr. Yang Xianjiang
    Ye Shengtao
    It has been eighteen years since Mr. Yang Xianjiang passed away, and only now do we commemorate him. Before, we only remembered him in our hearts, without holding a meeting or writing a memorial piece for him.
    I met Mr. Xianjiang at the Commercial Press and worked with him in the translation and editing department. He edited "Student Magazine," but he wasn't the editor-in-chief. He took into account the intentions of the editor-in-chief (which weren't very brilliant at the time) and, at the same time, refused to compromise the interests of the readers. He managed to make "Student Magazine" play a significant role among students. People who are now middle-aged still remember the influence "Student Magazine" had on them in the teens of the Republic of China. This matter seems ordinary, but it was actually very difficult.
    His life was very regular. Outside of work hours, he rarely changed his reading or exercise schedule. Occasionally, when I visited him, I always saw him sitting there respectfully, studying diligently. I immediately remembered that it was his reading time and felt embarrassed to stay long. I often guessed that he was so serious probably because he was influenced by the doctrines of the Neo-Confucianists. Later, I learned that it was indeed the case. However, he was already a revolutionary at that time. From the perspective of class consciousness and the viewpoints of materialism and idealism, revolutionaries and Neo-Confucianists are completely different. Yet, in being serious about everything, they have something similar (excluding those who are just pretending). It seems that quite a few people transitioned from Neo-Confucianism to revolution, Mr. Yun Daiying being one of them.
    I'm not very clear about how he engaged in revolutionary activities. I only know that many people came to see him at the translation and editing department. He could often be seen in the meeting room. Young people had great faith in him, and they often invited him to give speeches at meetings. He once invited me to join the Communist Party. One day, he asked me to attend the admission ceremony that very night. I didn't agree.
    He usually studied, wrote, and translated mostly in the fields of social sciences and education. His views on education, even from today's perspective, are still correct. Originally, as long as one recognizes that education is not an isolated matter, as long as one recognizes who education should serve, the views will not be too far off. I think if he were alive today, he might have been working in the old liberated areas for many years, engaged in educational work. With his earnest spirit, combined with the emphasis on local adaptation in the liberated areas, he would have made considerable contributions to education.
    He was particular about hygiene and regularly did calisthenics. With his tall and straight figure, broad shoulders, and rosy complexion, anyone could see that he was a model of health. Unexpectedly, he suddenly became ill. I can't remember clearly now, but it seemed to be pulmonary tuberculosis. I only remember that when I visited him, he was either sitting quietly or lying quietly, saying that he needed to rest more. Later, the illness affected his kidneys, and the treatment didn't seem to work. His wife, Yunyi, took care of him meticulously, never mentioning her own fatigue, only frowning when he couldn't see her because of his illness. Finally, he went to Japan for treatment and had a kidney removed, which seemed to improve things considerably. But after a few days, his condition suddenly changed, and he passed away. Yunyi brought back his ashes.
    For more than a decade, Yunyi has been working as a teacher in schools, living a hard life, and serving diligently, until now. Friends all say that she is worthy of being a revolutionary's widow. A son entered the Subei liberated area during the Anti-Japanese War and disappeared. Over the years, she has asked the relevant authorities to inquire in detail, but to no avail. Friends think that he probably sacrificed his life, but dare not say so to her face. Recently, news came from Shanghai that her son had been located, and everyone was happy for her. Her own joy can be imagined.

### 纪念杨贤江先生

    纪念杨贤江先生
    叶圣陶
    杨贤江先生去世一十八年，我们才来纪念他，以前只是记在心头，没有为他开过会，写过纪念文字。
    我跟贤江先生在商务印书馆相识，同在编译所。他编辑“学生杂志”，可不是主编。他一方面顾到主编人的意旨（在当时也不很高明的意旨），一方面不肯放松读者的利益，居然使“学生杂志”在学生界起了不小的作用，现在的中年人还能记住民十几年间“学生杂志”给他的影响。这回事看似平常，其实是很不容易的。
    他的生活最有规律。工作时间以外，什么时候读书，什么时候运动，很少有更改。偶尔去看他，见他必恭必敬的坐在那里用功，立刻想起这是他的读书时间，就不好意思多坐了。我好几次猜想，他这么认真，大概受过理学家那一套说法的影响。后来知道果然。但是他那时候已经是个革命者了。从阶级意识说，从唯物唯心的观点说，革命者跟理学家截然不同。然而在凡事认真这一点上，彼此却有某种类似的方面（那些假冒的当然不能算在内）。从理学转到革命的似乎很有几位，恽代英先生也是一个。
    他怎样干革命活动，我不大清楚。只知道到编译所来看他的人很多，会客室里时常可以见着他。青年们对他很有信仰，开什么会往往找他去演说。他曾经邀我加入共产党，有一天，他叫我晚上就去行入党式。我没有答应他。
    他平时研读跟著译大多在社会科学跟教育方面。他的对于教育的见解，现在看来也还是正确的。本来，只要认定教育并非孤立的事项，只要认定教育该为什么人服务，见解就错不到哪里去。我想，如果他健在到今天，也许早就到老解放区里干了多年的教育工作吧。凭他的认真的精神，配合着解放区里色色求其土生土长的风尚，在教育上该会有不少的贡献。
    他讲究卫生，经常作健身操，挺挺的高高的身躯，肩膀宽阔，脸色红红的，谁都看得出他是个标准的健康的人。不料他忽然病起来了，我现在已经记不清，好象是肺结核。只记得去看他的时候，他不是静静的坐着就是静静的躺着，说需要多多休养。后来病入了肾脏，医治总不见好。他的夫人韵漪照料他无微不至，不说自己劳困，只为他的病在他看不见的时候皱眉。最后到日本去治，割了一个肾脏，经过相当好。可是不几天突然转变，他去世了。韵漪带回来他的骨灰。
    十几年来，韵漪在学校担任教师，艰苦的生活，勤劳的服务，直到如今。朋友间都说她不愧为革命者的遗族。一个儿子在抗战期间进了苏北解放区，就没有消息，历年来托有关方面详细打听，毫无结果。朋友们都想，恐怕牺牲了，可不敢当她的面说。最近上海传来消息，说她的儿子有了着落，大家替她欢喜，她自己的欢喜当然可想而知了。
