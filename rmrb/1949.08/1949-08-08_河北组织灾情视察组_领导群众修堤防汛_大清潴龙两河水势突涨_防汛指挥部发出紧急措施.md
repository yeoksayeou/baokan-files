    【Baoding Electric】Since the beginning of summer, the water levels of rivers in Hebei Province have risen sharply several times, causing floods in some areas. In order to vigorously lead the masses to overcome the floods, the Hebei Provincial People's Government and the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China drew 21 cadres from various party, government, military, and civilian organizations at the provincial level to form six disaster inspection teams. On the morning of the 6th of this month, they departed for Tangshan, Tongxian, Hengshui, Cangxian and other regions, as well as Raoyang, Xianxian, Gaoyang, Anxin and other heavily flooded counties. They will lead the masses to continue vigorously repairing embankments for flood control, resolve disputes between regions during the flood season, and conduct a serious investigation of the disaster situation in preparation for laying the foundation for production and overcoming the famine.
    【Baoding Electric】In central Hebei Province, the water levels of the Daqing and Zhulong Rivers rose sharply on the 4th and 5th. At the Huagang Hydrological Station in Lixian County, the water level of the Zhulong River rose by 1.1 meters; at the Wangjiaying Hydrological Station in Rongcheng County on the Juma River, the water level rose by 3 meters; at the Nanguan Hydrological Station in Xiongxian County on the Daqing River, the water level rose by 1.77 meters, exceeding the highest water level in 1939 by 8 centimeters. On the Daqing River, a 30-li stretch of water from Suqiao to Xin鎮 is about one meter from the top of the embankment and sluice. The water level is still rising. This has caused breaches in Chenyangzhuang in Rongcheng County, and Mawutou and Jiugong in Xiong County. The Jiugong breach is 6 zhang wide, the Mawutou breach is 3 zhang wide, and the Chenyangzhuang breach had expanded to 20 zhang by 14:00 on the 5th, inundating a large area. In response to the current serious flood situation, the Hebei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters issued emergency measures and notified the flood control headquarters of each river system and the flood control committees of each county to mobilize all their strength to rush to repair sub-dikes, prepare a large amount of materials to plug the breaches when possible, and protect the dike heads at the already breached areas to prevent the breaches from expanding further. In addition, along the Daqing River, mass mobilization has begun in the Suqiao to Xinzhen section to vigorously repair the Liulang Dike on the north bank in order to prevent the flooded area from expanding.

    领导群众修堤防汛
    大清潴龙两河水势突涨
    防汛指挥部发出紧急措施
    【保定电】入夏以来河北省各河水势曾几次猛涨，部分地区泛滥成灾。河北省人民政府与中共河北省委，为大力领导群众战胜水灾，从省一级党政军民各机关抽调干部二十一名，组成六个灾情视察组。于本月六日上午分赴唐山、通县、衡水、沧县等专区及饶阳、献县、高阳、安新等水灾较重县份，领导群众继续大力修堤防汛和解决防汛期内地区间的纠纷问题，同时认真调查灾情，准备打下生产渡荒的基础。
    【保定电】河北省中部大清、潴龙两河于四、五两日水势突涨。潴龙河蠡县滑岗水位上涨一点一公尺，拒马河容城王家营水位上涨三公尺，大清河雄县南关水位上涨一点七七公尺，超过一九三九年最高水位八公寸，苏桥至新镇长约三十里的大清河水面，离堤闸高处一公尺左右。此时水势仍在上涨，至使容城陈杨庄、雄县马务头和九宫一带，三处决口，九宫决口宽六丈，马务头处宽三丈，陈杨庄决口在五日十四时已扩大到二十丈，水淹面积很大。根据目前严重水情，河北省防汛指挥部发出紧急措施，并通知各河系指挥部、各县防汛委员会，动员全力抢修子埝，大量备料相机堵口，在已决口处设法保护堤头，保持水口不再扩大。另外大清河并在苏桥至新镇段已开始发动群众大力抢修北岸的六郎堤，以防水淹面积扩大。
