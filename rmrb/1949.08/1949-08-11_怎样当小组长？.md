How to be a Group Leader?
By Ke Ruijiena

    You have been elected by the members of the Youth League group to be their group leader. They believe you will lead them well. Is their trust in you misplaced? This depends on you proving it with your actions. We have already discussed how important a Youth League group is. But since you are the leader of the Youth League group, you must lead this group of young people forward, setting an example for them in labor, social work, and conduct.

  Establish Bolshevik Friendship

    Only when you and everyone are very friendly and close can you unite the comrades around you. Without friendship, without unity among comrades, the group's affairs cannot be done well. Naturally, there are various kinds of friendship. You, as a group leader, should establish a true, Bolshevik friendship with the members. You should share joys and sorrows with the young people. But at the same time, you must not cover up the shortcomings of comrades, nor be indifferent. The members in the group (and all the young workers in your labor team) are all different people. Some work well, some work less well. Some have already recognized the meaning of discipline, while others do not yet understand what discipline is. To speak of true friendship, you must point out the facts to comrades frankly: if he is lazy to work—push him to be faster; if he does not want to correct himself, and is still negligent and sloppy, then you should bring the group and respected veteran comrades together to re-educate this young person.

  Earn Prestige Through Effort

    The group leader must be an advanced worker in production. True friendship will not hinder you from learning from those who are particularly experienced in production. Sometimes, it is not so easy for a group leader to be an advanced production worker. At first, you may not have enough ability and experience. But since people elected you as the group leader, you must try to keep up with the excellent workers, and even surpass them. In any case, you must achieve this. In our country, a person is respected if they have a good attitude towards labor. Your comrades will only listen to you and complete your instructions when you yourself play a model role in labor, abide by discipline, work hard and be diligent, and do what you say.

    You must have prestige among the Youth League members and young people. And prestige must be earned. How to earn prestige? We have already said: first, play a model role in labor. This is the main thing. But this is not all.

    You must not only be a model in labor, but also be a model in conduct.

    The same goes for everything else, no matter what you start, always see things through to the end. In this way, all comrades will know that you are a person who matches words with deeds.

    ▲ You yourself must work conscientiously and accurately. All the tasks you accept must be completed well and on time. In this way, the Youth League members will also pay attention to the work and instructions you assign to them. In this way, you have the right to strictly demand them—a group leader's task stipulates that you must do this. For example, if you asked a member to organize a ski trip, but if you yourself have talked to him twice and both times have been delayed, can that member still complete the task you gave him? But if the members know that you are enthusiastically engaged in all social work, accurately and without fail, then they will be embarrassed to fall behind you, and they will respect and pay attention to your instructions.

    ▲ Do not be arrogant and complacent, bossy, do not regard yourself as a "Youth League superior" above the members and young people. The members elected you as the leader, but they also have the right to withdraw their trust in you if you put on airs and become arrogant. You must remember: no matter when, the members always have something worth learning from you. You must listen to their opinions and discuss things with them.

  Care About Your Comrades

    ▲ The group leader must care about his comrades and be inseparable from them. Your direct duty is to support their correct and reasonable demands. For example, if someone violates labor laws, then you go to the foreman, to the Youth League Committee, and to the factory director, and try your best to make them enforce the labor laws. The group leader must also care about those who need shoes to get shoes, and help those who should enter the young workers' school to be able to enroll.

    When you help young people and Youth League members improve their lives, when you care about them, don't turn yourself into a "nanny." There are also people here who always want to live off others, that is, they want to be supported by the state, it's always "give me this" or "give me that." This kind of thinking is not right. It should be explained to them: we are not living in ordinary times, because there is a war, we must restrain many of our demands. Young people (especially during wartime) should be educated in this way, so that we understand: we should demand more of ourselves and less of the state. Youth League members and young people should be educated to have a thrifty and master-like attitude towards goods. Some young people are careless about clothes and shoes, and do not repair them in time. Do not be indifferent to these phenomena. Some young people also do not know how to manage their salaries. As soon as the money is issued, it is immediately used up, and then for the second half of the month, they live by borrowing money. At this time, the Youth League should hold a group meeting, and invite a respected older worker to talk about how to use their salary, to help these young people in this way. Sometimes the public dormitory is very dirty, making people uncomfortable, but the young people do not do anything themselves, like children waiting for adults to take care of them. You should tell everyone why it is not right to have this attitude towards one's life. At this time, you can choose a smart organizer to help him unite the young people in the dormitory. In this way, the young people will be able to do a lot of things with their own strength.

    You must remember: the Youth League should become a school of life for young people, the Youth League should teach young people to live correctly and civilly.

  Consult More with Party Members

    When encountering difficulties in life, you should go to the Party organization in the factory or individual Communist Party members to discuss. Older, experienced comrades will tell you whether your thinking is good or not, right or wrong. If you are doing a good thing, they will give you suggestions on how to do better. All of this—the help of older comrades, your personal prestige (which is earned by your warm and strict attitude towards the members), will help you to educate every member in the group, to educate every young worker in your labor team.

    怎样当小组长？
    柯热维娜作
    青年团小组的团员们选举了你当他们的组长。他们相信你会好好领导他们，他们对你的信任错没错？这就要靠用你行动来证明了。我们已经谈过了团小组有多么大的作用。可是你既然是青年团小组的领导人，你就必须领导这群青年跟着你前进，在劳动中，社会工作和行为中要给他们作模范。
  建立起布尔塞维克的友谊
    只有在你和大家都很友好很亲密的时候，你才能把同志们团结在自己周围。没有友谊，没有同志们中间的团结，小组的事情是搞不好的。自然，友谊也有各种各样的。你，一个小组的领导人，应该和团员们建立起一种真正的、布尔什维克的友谊。你应该和青年们同甘苦共患难。但是同时你还不能掩盖同志的缺点，也不能漠不关心。小组中的团员（你那个劳动队中的全体青年工人也是这样），是一些各色各样的人们。有些人工作得好，有些人工作得坏一些。有些人已经认识了纪律的意义，另一些人还不懂得纪律是怎么回事儿。要讲真正的友谊，你就得对同志直言不讳地指出事实来：如果他懒得工作——就推动他快一些，如果不想改正，还是吊尔郎当、埋里埋汰的，那你就把小组和有威望的老同志都找来再教育这个青年。
  用努力去赢得威信
    小组长必须是生产中的先进工作者，真正的友谊不会妨碍你向那些在生产上特别在经验的人学习。有时候，一个小组长要作先进的生产工作者不是那么容易的。一起初，可能是能力和经验都不够。但是既然人们选你作小组长了，那你就得尽力跟那些优秀的工人们看齐，甚至还要赶过他们。无论如何，你也要做到这一点。在我们国家，一个人如果劳动态度好，人们就尊敬他。你的同志们，也只有当你自己在劳动中起模范作用，遵守纪律，勤苦耐劳和说到作到的时候，才会听你的话，完成你的指示。
    在青年团员与青年中间，你要有威信。而威信是要靠人去赢得。怎样赢得威信呢？我们已经说过了：首先要在劳动中起模范作用。这是主要的。但这还不是全部。
    你不但要在劳动中作一个模范，而且要在品行上起模范作用。
    对别的任何事情也都是一样，不管你着手干什么，永远要把事情进行到底。这样一来，所有的同志们便会知道你是一个言行一致的人。
    ▲你自己就要认真准确地工作。凡是你接受的任务，都要好好地按期完成。这样，青年团员们对你分配给他们的工作与指示，也便会重视。这样，你就有权利严格地要求他们——一个小组长的任务规定你必须这样作。譬如说，你曾经让一团员组织一次滑雪，可是如果你自己跟他说过两次而两次又都拖延下来，那个团员还能够完成你所给的任务么？可是如果团员们知道你对于一切社会工作都是兴致勃勃地去作，准确不误，那么他们就将不好意思落在你的后面，他们对你的指示就将尊重和注意。
    ▲不要骄傲自满，盛气凌人，不要把自己看成凌驾在团员与青年们之上的“青年团上级”。团员们把你选作领导人，但是他们也有权利撤回他们对你的信任，如果你摆架子，骄傲起来的话。你要记住：不管什么时候，团员们总有些值得你学习的地方。你要倾听他们的意见，有事和他们商量。
  关心自己的同志
    ▲组长必须关心自己的同志，和他们不分彼此。你的直接义务就是支持他们正确合理的要求。例如，有人破坏了劳动法，那你就到工长那儿，到青年团委员会和厂长那儿去，要尽力做到使他们执行劳动法。组长也要关心使那些需要鞋的人得到鞋，帮助那些应当入青工学校的人得以入学。
    在你帮助青年和青年团员搞好生活的时候，在你关心他们的时候，不要把自己变成一个“奶妈”。我们这里也有一种人，他们总想靠别人生活，就是说，他们想靠国家养活，不是“给我这个”就是“给我那个”。他们这种思想是不对的。应当对他们解释：我们不是生活在平常时期，因为有战争，必须节制自己的许多要求。应当这样教育青年（特别是在战争时期），使我们懂得：我们要对自己要求得多一些，向国家要求得少一些。应该教育青年团员和青年，使他们对物品有一种节约的、主人的态度。有一些青年对衣服鞋子漫不经心，也不适时地修理。对这些现象，你不要漠不关心。也有些青年不会支配自己的薪俸。一发下来钱，马上就用光了，而后半个月呢，就靠借钱来生活。这时候，青年团应该开个小组会，请一个有威望的老年工人来给讲一讲，应该怎样使用自己的薪俸，用这样方法帮助这些青年。有时候公共宿舍里挺脏，让人不舒服，可是青年们自己不动手，象孩子一样等着大人照顾。你要对大家讲：对自己生活抱这种态度为什么不正确。这时候你可以选择一个聪明的组织者，帮助他把宿舍的青年们团结起来。这样，青年们便会用自己的力量做出很多事情来。
    你要记住：青年团应该成为青年的一所生活学校，青年团应该教给青年正确地、文明地生活。
  多向党员们请教
    在生活中遇到困难的时候，你要去找厂房的党组织或个别的共产党员商量。年长的，经验丰富的同志们会告诉你，你想的事情好不好，对不对，如果你是在作一件好事情，他们会给你提出意见来，怎样能够做得更好。这一切——年长的同志们的帮助，你个人的威信（这是靠你对团员们热情同时又严格的态度赢得的），会帮助你去教育团小组中的每个团员，教育你那劳动队中每一个青年工人。
