    Central Hebei (referring to the former Central Hebei Region, encompassing four special districts and forty-seven counties) is one of China's important sources of industrial raw materials. It is rich in cotton, peanuts, and other products, but grain is insufficient. According to a survey by the former Central Hebei Administrative Office's Agricultural Department, Central Hebei currently has 3,430,000 mu of cultivated land and a population of 8,989,000. This year, 5,000,000 mu have been planted with cotton and peanuts, leaving 22,930,000 mu for grain production. Excluding melon patches, orchards, wasteland, sandy land, and alkaline land, and assuming 27,000,000 mu, based on last year's average grain yield of 150 jin per mu, the total grain production would be 405,000,000 jin. Based on an average daily grain consumption of 1.5 jin per person (including livestock feed and other consumption), the total annual grain consumption would be 492,000,000 jin, leaving a shortage of 87,000,000 jin. If this year's increased production plan is fully realized, the annual grain production can be increased by 24,000,000 jin, but the region will still be short of 63,100,000 jin. If there are further disasters such as floods, droughts, or pests, the grain supply will be insufficient. Central Hebei had a grain shortage before the Anti-Japanese War, and the main sources of food were the Northeast, Northwest, and Yuci and Taigu in Shanxi. During the Anti-Japanese War, production further decreased due to destruction and looting by the enemy and puppets. In the future, supplying cities will involve exchanging fine grains for coarse grains. Industrial raw materials for oil and cotton, as well as various local products, are the main materials supplied to cities.

    This year, Central Hebei planted 3,000,000 mu of cotton. Assuming a yield of 30 jin of seed cotton per mu, the total production would be 90,000,000 jin (production may be reduced this year due to disasters in some areas). 2,000,000 mu of peanuts were planted, with an estimated production of 500,000,000 jin. In addition, a considerable amount of sesame and hemp has been planted. After deducting military and civilian use in the region, approximately 58,440,000 jin of cotton can be exported, and approximately 300,000,000 jin of peanuts can be used as industrial raw materials after deducting seeds and consumption in the region. In addition, Central Hebei has many local products (or specialties) that can be supplied to cities to strengthen the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. These specialties mainly include:

    (1) Aquatic products and weaving industry of Baiyangdian: In addition to producing wheat, rice, vegetables, indigo, lotus roots, and other crops, Baiyangdian mainly produces fish and reed mats. There are no overall statistics on fish production, but in Anxin's third district alone, 90% of the 156 households in twenty villages are fishermen. During the fishing season, each fishing boat can catch about 100 to 200 jin of fish per day, and each jin of large fish can be exchanged for one jin of rice locally. Generally, fishermen can earn about 100,000 RMB within one and a half months. Second is the reed mat weaving industry: with the support of the state-owned Longchang Store and the county promotion society, it has developed considerably. Longchang Store alone collected 323,750 reed mats in four and a half months in the four markets of Laohetou and others. Wen'an depression has a total of 71 villages producing reeds, with 657 qing of reed land, which can weave 3,000,000 reed mats every year. 122 villages weave reed mats, and 70% of the farmers (about 200,000 people) rely on weaving reed mats for a living. Reed mats are sold widely, and before the Anti-Japanese War, they were sold to Hebei, Tianjin, the Northwest, the Northeast, and even Korea and Japan.

    (2) Straw hat industry in Jiahe, Xianxian, Hejian, Raoyang, Qingxian, and other places: Before the Anti-Japanese War, Xianxian straw hat factories developed to 85, with 210 machines and more than 600 workers, weaving 840 dozen straw hats every day. Braiding straw hat braids has become one of the main sideline occupations of local farmers, and women generally participate. In Weijiazhuang, a village with 123 households, as many as 180 women are engaged in braiding straw hats.

    (3) Bristle industry in Shenze: It has a history of more than 50 years. Before the Anti-Japanese War, pig bristles were transported from Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Suiyuan, and other places, processed and manufactured here, and then transported to Tianjin for export, with the largest annual amount reaching 3,000,000 jin. Merchants from Tianjin, Nanjing, and Baoding came here to buy. It collapsed after the Anti-Japanese War. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, state-owned stores provided loans and supported, and also brought some private capital to buy bristles in Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, and other places, and gradually recovered. According to statistics last year, more than 18,600 jin of large bristles were exported, and 5,000,000 jin of bristles were purchased, which were manufactured into more than 260,000 jin of hair slivers (semi-finished products). After the bristles are made into hair slivers, half of the waste material remains for every 100 jin, half of which can be made into hair ropes, and the remaining can be used as fertilizer, which is even better than soybean cake.

    (4) Native cloth industry in Gaoyang: Before the Anti-Japanese War, it was sold to 18 provinces and as far as the South Sea Islands. It once declined during the Anti-Japanese War, but later it developed rapidly under the policy of self-reliance and encouragement of rural textile industry by the democratic government. According to statistics in December last year, 4,000 looms were operating in the county (there are currently 11,715 iron wheel machines), producing 59,000 bolts of white cloth and 8,000 bolts of various colored striped cloths per month. After the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, Gaoyang cloth showed a shrinking trend due to poor sales. Recently, with the help of the government and state-owned stores, Gaoyang cloth has risen slightly again. After the liberation of the whole country, if attention is paid to organizing transportation and sales, there is still a certain way out.

    (5) Pocket industry in Raoyang: It is the largest handicraft industry in the area. According to the statistics of 28 villages in 1936, there were 600 pocket weaving machines, driving about 10,000 spinning wheels in Anping, Wuqiang, Shenxian, Raoyang and other counties, and sold to the northeastern provinces and Zhangyuan. Most of them collapsed during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, with the assistance of the government, weaving machines recovered to 500 by the end of the lunar year last year. Last year, the promotion society supplied more than 130,000 jin of cotton to the masses and purchased more than 100,000 pockets (not including those sold by the masses themselves).

    (6) Shenze's honey peaches, Jiahe and Suning's Ya pears, and Jianguo and Xinle's dates are sold to various provinces in China and to Tianjin and Beijing. Before the Anti-Japanese War, Ya pears were also exported to foreign countries. When pear prices were high, a pear tree could be exchanged for 20 shi of millet. The yield of one mu of pears can be equivalent to more than a dozen mu of crops, which is one of the main incomes of local farmers. Jianguo County has 113 villages, with more than 58,000 mu of jujube forests and more than 2,390,000 jujube trees (about 35 jujube trees can be planted per mu), which are mostly made into finished products in Tianjin and Beijing for export, in addition to sales in the mainland.

    In addition, Anping's Luo bottom industry, Xinji's fur industry, Dacheng and Dingxian's sweet potato flour industry, Zhaoxian and Gaocheng's bone fertilizer industry, as well as Baoding's egg beating industry and Cangzhou's winter vegetable industry, have their certain value in urban and rural material exchange.

    Central Hebei's transportation is relatively convenient, which is an advantageous condition for product sales. The central issue at present is how to improve and develop these agricultural and sideline industries and handicrafts, strengthen the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, regulate what is available and what is not, supply industrial raw materials to develop industrial production, and increase farmers' income and improve rural purchasing power, so that industrial products can obtain a broad market.

    Central Hebei also has other handicrafts related to local crops and agricultural tools, such as the oil pressing industry, with 3,496 oil mills (excluding the tenth district). Last year, only 1,490 were put into operation (including 6 machine pressure plants, 25 iron presses, and 3,912 wooden troughs). This year, about 300,000,000 jin of peanuts can be used for oil pressing, and about 170,000,000 jin of cottonseed, as well as beans, hemp seeds, sesame seeds, etc., have not yet been calculated. If all these oil crops are pressed into oil, it will not be enough to put all the oil mills into operation. If these oil crops can all be pressed into oil, about 31,356 tons of oil can be exported this year.

    The iron and wood industry can also be greatly developed. According to the statistics of eight counties in the ninth district alone, 5,433 new waterwheels are needed. If farmers' purchasing power is improved, the demand for waterwheels will be even greater. If a large number of wells can be dug and waterwheels can be installed to turn dry land into irrigated land, the difficulty of insufficient grain in Central Hebei can be solved. Therefore, the government must have appropriate policies to reward farmers for digging wells and ensure their realization.

    At the same time, for various local products (or specialties), it is necessary to establish supply and marketing cooperatives by category, and organize transportation, sales, and distribution in a planned way, open up sales channels, and organize exports to increase people's income. The experience created by the Central Hebei Production Promotion Society in supporting the Raoyang pocket industry, close coordination between various departments, and the signing of ordering contracts are worth promoting.

    冀中（指原冀中区，辖四个专区四十七个县）是我国重要工业原料出产地之一。盛产棉花、花生等，粮食则不充足。据原冀中行署农业处的调查，冀中现有耕地面积三四三○万亩，人口八百九十八万九千人，今年植棉花、花生共五百万亩，产粮食地尚有二千九百三十万亩，除去瓜、果、荒、沙、碱地，如以二千七百万亩计，按去年每亩平均产粮一五○市斤计算，共可产米四十万万零五千万斤。按每人每日平均吃粮食一斤半（包括牲口食料及其他消耗在内）计算，全年共需吃粮食四十九万万二千余斤，尚缺粮八万万七千余斤。如今年增产计划全部实现，全年能增产粮食两万万四千万斤，全区尚缺粮六万万三千一百多万斤。如再遭到水、旱、虫等灾害，粮食即感不足。抗战前冀中就缺粮，食粮来源主要靠东北、西北及山西榆次、太谷等地。抗战期间受敌伪的摧残掠夺，产量更加减少。今后如供给城市，则是以一分细粮换回粗粮。而油棉工业原料及各种土产等，则是供给城市的主要物资。
    冀中今年种了棉花三百万亩，以每亩产皮棉三十斤计，可产九千万斤（今年部分地区受灾可能减产）；种花生二百万亩，约可产花生五万万斤；此外还种了不少芝麻、大麻等。棉花除去本区军需民用，约可输出五千八百四十四万余斤，花生除去本区种籽及吃用外，可供作工业原料用的约三万万斤。此外，冀中尚有不少土产（或特产）可供给城市加强城乡物资的交流。这些特产主要有：
    （一）白洋淀的水产及编织业：白洋淀除产麦、水稻、蔬菜、土靛、莲藕等作物外，主要出产有鱼和苇席，鱼产尚无总的统计材料，仅安新三区二十个村一五六户，即有百分之九十的渔民。打渔的季节每只渔船每天约可捕鱼一百至二百斤，每斤大鱼可换当地大米一斤；一般渔民在一个半月内即可获利人民币十万元左右。其次是织苇席业：在国营隆昌商店及县推进社的扶助下，有相当的发展。隆昌商店光在老河头等四个集市上，四个半月中就收席三十二万三千七百五十领。文安洼共有七十一个村产苇子，有苇地六百五十七顷，每年可织席三百万领，织席村庄一百二十二个，百分之七十农民（约二十万人）依靠织席为生。席的销路很广，抗战前行销河北、平津、西北、东北等地，并到达朝鲜及日本等地。
    （二）交河、献县、河间、饶阳、青县等地的草帽业：献县抗战前草帽工厂发展到八十五家，有机器二百一十架，工人六百多名，每天织草帽八百四十打。结草帽辫成为当地农民的主要副业之一，妇女普遍参加。位家庄一百二十三户的村子，从事编草帽的妇女即达一百八十人。
    （三）深泽的鬃毛业：已有五十余年历史，抗战前从山东、河南、山西、绥远等处运来猪鬃，经这里加工制造后，运往天津出口，来往最多时年达三百万斤。天津、南京、保定客商，多来此收买。抗战后垮台。石家庄解放后，国营商店贷款扶持，并带起一部私资去河南、山东、山西等处买鬃毛，才逐渐恢复。去年统计，即输出大鬃一万八千六百余斤，购来鬃毛五百万斤，经制造梳成毛绺（半成品）二十六万多斤。鬃毛制成毛绺后，每百斤可剩一半废料，其中二分之一可做毛绳，下余可作肥料，比豆饼还好。
    （四）高阳的土布业：抗战前行销十八省，远达南洋群岛等地；抗战时期曾一度衰落，后在民主政府自力更生与奖励农村纺织业的方针下有飞跃发展。据去年十二月份统计：全县织布机开动到四千张（现有铁轮机一一七一五架），月产白布五万九千匹及各种花条布八千匹。平津解放后，高阳布因销路不畅，呈萎缩状态。近经政府及国营商店的扶助，高阳布又略有上升。全国解放后，如注意组织运销，还有一定的出路。
    （五）饶阳的口袋业：是该地最大的一种手工业，据一九三六年二十八个村的统计，有织口袋机子六百张，带动安平、武强、深县、饶阳等县的纺车约万辆以上，行销东北各省及张垣等处。抗战时期大部垮台。抗战胜利后在政府扶助下，到去年阴历年底织机恢复到五百张。去年全年推进社供给群众棉花十三万余斤，收购口袋十万余条（群众自己卖的不在内）。
    （六）深泽的大蜜桃，交河、肃宁的鸭梨，建国、新乐的枣，行销国内各省及平津等地，抗战前鸭梨运往国外的也很多。梨价高时，一棵梨树就能换二十石小米。一亩梨可顶十几亩庄稼的产量，为当地农民主要收入之一。建国全县一百一十三村，有枣林五万八千多亩，枣树有二百万三千九百多株（每亩地可种枣树三十五棵左右），除运销内地外，多在平津等地制成成品向外输出。
    此外，如安平的罗底业，辛集的皮毛业，大城、定县的甘粉业，赵县、藁城的骨肥业，以及保定的打蛋业，沧州的冬菜业等，在城乡物资交换中，都有其一定的价值。
    冀中交通比较便利，是产品运销上的有利条件，当前中心问题就是如何提高与发展这些农副业与手工业生产，加强城乡物资交流，调剂有无，供给工业原料，以发展工业生产，并增加农民收入，提高农村购买力，使工业生产品得到广大的市场。
    冀中区尚有其他手工业与当地农作物及农业工具有关的、如打油业，有油房三千四百九十六座（十分区不在内），去年只开动了一千四百九十座（包括机器压力厂六座、铁榨二十五座、木槽三九一二个），今年花生可作打油用的约三万万斤，棉子约有一万万七千万斤，还有豆子、大麻子、芝麻等尚未计算在内，要都打成油，将所有油房全部开动起来也不敷用。如这些油料作物都能打成油，今年约可输出油三一三五六吨。
    铁木业也可大加发展。仅据九分区八个县的统计，即需要新添水车五四三三辆，如农民购买力提高，水车的需要量将更大。如能大量打井置水车，变旱地为水地，冀中粮食不足的困难即可解决。因此，政府必须有适当的奖励农民打井的政策，并保证其实现。
    同时，对各种土产（或特产）需分别门类，成立供销社，有计划的组织运销、分配，打开销路，组织出口，以增加人民的收入。冀中生产推进社在扶植饶阳口袋业工作上所创造的经验，各部门密切联系，订立订货合同，这些办法是值得发扬的。
