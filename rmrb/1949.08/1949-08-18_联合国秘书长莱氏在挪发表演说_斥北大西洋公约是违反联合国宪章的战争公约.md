Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: Telecommunications Agency Copenhagen News: UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie delivered a speech at a special gathering in Bergen, the central city of Norway, a North Atlantic Treaty nation, on August 8. He shattered the efforts of North Atlantic politicians to portray this aggressive pact as an instrument of peace and to insist that it closely conforms to the UN's provisions regarding regional agreements. Lie did not directly mention the North Atlantic Treaty, but unmistakably pointed to it, saying, "Such measures, in the UN's sense, cannot be called regional." Lie referred to the "series of discussions" that have recently erupted in many countries "regarding regional cooperation between individual countries or groups of countries," in which it has been repeatedly reiterated that "such regional cooperation is as important or even more important than cooperation through the United Nations." He said this is "a short-sighted view that confuses countries." Lie emphasized that no regional agreement or bilateral agreement can replace or substitute the United Nations, as an organization for the entire world. Lie continued, saying that the UN Charter clearly defines regional cooperation, but also defines the limits of regional cooperation. Articles 52, 53, and 54 allow for the establishment of regional agreements, primarily for the peaceful resolution of local disputes. Its premise is that forceful measures may not be used without the special permission of the Security Council. In other words, the UN's control over regional agreements is entirely clear. In his speech, Lie launched three attacks on North Atlantic Treaty politicians. First, he attacked their claim that the North Atlantic Treaty's value as a security measure surpasses that of UN control. Second, he pointed out that the legitimacy of regional agreements should be found in the aforementioned three articles, which the North Atlantic Treaty completely ignores. Third, Lie emphasized that these three articles stipulate the peaceful resolution of "local disputes," while the North Atlantic Treaty, on the contrary, clearly stipulates external aggression. After describing the usefulness of local cooperation in various regions of the world, and specifically mentioning the Economic Commission for Europe (where it has been possible to "discuss matters such as trade within Europe—Eastern and Western Europe, and Western Europe and Eastern Europe—quite calmly"), he continued meaningfully: "Regional cooperation must be viewed in the correct perspective. If cooperation is carried out in accordance with the provisions and interests of the United Nations, it will benefit all of humanity; if cooperation begins in violation of the United Nations and in conflict with the United Nations, its ultimate results will be irreparable. I do not want to discuss Article 51 of the UN Charter, which stipulates that collective defense is permitted in the period before the Security Council can take necessary measures in the event of an armed attack on a member state. This provision is clearly temporary. Regardless of what special agreements may be made in accordance with this provision, I do not believe that this provision will ever be actually applied. Such an agreement cannot be considered a regional measure in the sense intended by the United Nations." The only article of the UN Charter mentioned in the North Atlantic Treaty is precisely Article 51, which the treaty considers to be in accordance with the UN Charter. Lie even further indirectly implied that the North Atlantic Treaty, contrary to the UN Charter, is a pact of war. Lie finally stated: "As we know, a new world war is simply impossible today. A third world war, which irresponsible elements are discussing, will leave neither victors nor vanquished... The path of the United Nations is always the path of peace. This is the goal we aspire to. We must, will, and can reach this goal."

　　联合国秘书长莱氏在挪发表演说
    斥北大西洋公约是违反联合国宪章的战争公约
    【新华社北平十七日电】电通社哥本哈根讯：联合国秘书长莱氏于八月八日在北大西洋公约国家挪威的中心城市卑尔根的特别集会上发表演说。他打破了北大西洋政治家们竭力把这个侵略公约说成是和平工具和硬说它是密切符合于联合国关于区域性协定的规定的努力。莱氏没有直接提及北大西洋公约，但令人不会误解地指着北大西洋公约说：“这种措置，按联合国的意义说，不能称为是区域性的”。莱氏提及最近许多国家中爆发的“关于单个国家或国家集团间区域合作”的“成串讨论”，在这些讨论中，不断有人重申“这种区域性合作与经过联合国的合作同样重要甚至更为重要”。他说，这是“使各国混乱的短视的看法”。莱氏强调说，没有什么区域性协定或双边协定能够置换或代替作为整个世界的组织的联合国。莱氏继称，联合国宪章清楚地确定了区域合作，但同时也确定了区域合作的限度。第五十二、五十三、五十四条允许建立区域协定，首先是为了和平解决地方性争执。它的前提是：不得安理会特别许可，不得使用强力措施。换句话说：联合国对区域协定的支配权是完全清楚的。莱氏在其演说中向北大西洋公约政治家提出三点抨击。首先，他抨击他们说北大西洋公约作为安全措施其价值胜过联合国管制的说法。第二，他指出区域协定的合法性应到上述三条里去找，但这三条恰恰是北大西洋公约完全忽略了的。第三，莱氏强调称，这三条规定和平解决“地方性争端”，而北大西洋公约则相反，明白地规定外来的侵略。莱氏在叙述了世界各不同地区中地方性合作的用处，并特别谈及欧洲经委会（在那里曾有可能“颇冷静地讨论欧洲内部——东欧与西欧及西欧与东欧的贸易之类的事情”）后，意味深长地继称：“必须用正确的透视来看区域合作。如果合作是按照联合国的规定和利益进行的，则将有利于整个人类；如果合作是违反联合国、与联合国抵触地开始的，则其最后结果将是无法补救的。我不想讨论联合国宪章第五十一条，该条规定在安全理事会于会员国遭受武装攻击的情况下能采取必要措施以前的时期中，允许集体防御。这一规定清楚地是临时性的。不问按照这一规定可能作出何种特别协定，我不相信这一规定会在无论什么时候被实际应用到。这种协定不能认为是联合国意义所指的区域性措置。”在北大西洋公约中提及联合国宪章的唯一一条恰恰是第五十一条，该公约自认为符合于联合国宪章。莱氏甚至进一步间接地暗示了：北大西洋公约，与联合国宪章相反，是战争的公约。莱氏最后声称：“如我们所知，一次新的世界大战今天根本是不可能的。不负责任分子所讨论的一个第三次世界大战既不会留下胜利者，也不会留下被征服者……联合国的道路永远是和平的道路。这是我们所企盼着的目标。我们必须、将要、而且能够到达这一目标。”
