Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, August 26th: People from all walks of life in the Lushun-Dalian area sternly condemned the White Paper published by the U.S. State Department. Sang Fengqi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Lushun-Dalian Federation of Trade Unions, said: "The White Paper clearly tells us the aggressive nature of American imperialism." Guo Chao, Propaganda Minister of the Lushun-Dalian Democratic Women's Federation, said: "American imperialism attempts to use so-called 'democratic individualist elements' to create trouble from within the Chinese people, but this conspiracy is also doomed to fail." Liu Nansheng, Secretary of the Lushun-Dalian District Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, said: "In the past, many progressive youths have recognized the essence of American imperialism. This White Paper makes us more deeply understand the truth of Chairman Mao's 'leaning to one side' towards the Soviet Union." Li Qingrong, an industrial model worker, said: "American imperialists see that the Chinese people have won victory and will never be reconciled; but no matter what tricks they play, they are bound to fail." Zhang Shougong, a professor at Dalian University, said: "Let the Wall Street invaders rant! The Chinese people have prepared enough strength to defeat the invaders. Chairman Mao told us that there is only one path for the imperialists' aggression: death."

　　美帝阴谋必遭失败
  　旅大各界斥白皮书
    【新华社大连二十六日电】旅大地区各界人民严斥美国国务院发表的白皮书。旅大职工总会副秘书长桑凤歧说：白皮书就很明显的告诉我们美帝国主义的侵略本质。旅大民主妇女联合会宣传部长郭超说：美帝国主义企图利用所谓“民主个人主义分子”从中国人民内部来捣乱，但这种阴谋诡计也一定失败。新民主主义青年团旅大区团委书记刘南生说：过去许多进步青年已认识了美帝国主义的本质，这次白皮书就更使我们体会到毛主席的向苏联方面“一边倒”的真理。工业特等劳动模范李庆荣说：美帝国主义者看见中国人民胜利了，决不甘心；但不管他出什么鬼计，也一定失败。大连大学教授章守恭说：让华尔街的侵略者们狂吠吧，中国人民已经准备了战胜侵略者的足够力量，毛主席告诉我们，帝国主义者们的侵略只有一条路，就是死亡。
