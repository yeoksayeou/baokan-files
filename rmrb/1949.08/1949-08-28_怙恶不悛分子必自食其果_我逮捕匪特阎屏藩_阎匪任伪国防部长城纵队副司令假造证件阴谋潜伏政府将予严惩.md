　　Those Who Cling to Evil Will Surely Eat Their Own Bitter Fruit:
  　We Arrested Bandit Special Agent Yan Pingfan
    Bandit Yan Served as Deputy Commander of the Great Wall Column of the Puppet Ministry of National Defense, Forged Documents, and Conspired to Lurk Within the Government; Will Be Severely Punished
    [Report from this newspaper] The bandit gang special agent leader Yan Pingfan, Deputy Commander of the Great Wall Column of the puppet Ministry of National Defense, known for his viciousness and cruelty, disregarded the military control commission's proclamation and refused to register, plotting to hide and continue his counter-revolutionary activities. When personnel from our Public Security Internal Affairs First Bureau were checking household registrations, Bandit Yan presented a false document, falsely claiming to be an ordinary retired soldier. After our staff interrogated him in detail and saw through his treachery, the criminal, clinging to his evil ways, still attempted to sophistically argue. He was arrested on the 23rd along with two accomplices. Furthermore, Chen Haiyuan, a member of the Kuomintang district branch and an agent of the Central Statistics Bureau who was formerly a member of the puppet police bureau in the Outer First District, consistently engaged in suppressing revolutionary activities before liberation, presiding over the torture of revolutionary martyrs, countless revolutionary people were persecuted by him. After the promulgation of the order for registration of reactionary party and league personnel, not only did the criminal refuse to register, but when personnel from our Public Security Internal Affairs Sixth Bureau advised him to register, he was arrogant and pretended to be related to the Second Section of the Public Security External Affairs First Bureau, and refused to repent. The Internal Affairs Sixth Bureau arrested him a few days ago. The government will severely punish Yan, Chen, and other criminals according to the law.

    【本报讯】以毒辣残忍著名的匪帮特务头子伪国防部长城纵队副司令阎屏藩，对本市军管会布告置之不顾，拒绝登记，图谋隐匿，继续其反革命活动。我公安内一分局人员查户口时，阎匪持一假证件妄称为一普通退役军人。经我工作人员详加盘诘，洞悉其奸，该犯怙恶不悛，仍图獍辩，遂于二十三日连同其同犯二名一并加以逮捕。又前外一区伪警局局员中统分子陈海元，系伪国民党区分部委员。解放前一贯从事镇压革命活动，主持刑讯革命志士，革命志士遭其迫害者不计其数。此次反动党团人员登记令公布后，该犯不特拒绝登记，且当我公安内六分局人员劝其登记时，态度倨傲，冒充是我公安外一分局二科的关系，不肯悔悟。内六分局已于日前将其逮捕。政府对阎、陈等犯均将依法予以严惩。
