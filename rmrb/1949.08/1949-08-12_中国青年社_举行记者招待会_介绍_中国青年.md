    China Youth Society
    Holds Press Conference
    to Introduce "China Youth"
    [Ping City News] The "China Youth" Society held a press conference on the 8th of this month to introduce the history, policies, and content of "China Youth." The main points are as follows:
    "China Youth" is a publication for advanced Chinese youth to unite and educate their generation with Marxist-Leninist thought. "China Youth" was first published on October 20, 1923, and was edited by Yun Daiying at the time. It was the organ of the Chinese Socialist Youth League (later renamed the Communist Youth League). This publication continued until 1927, publishing one hundred fifty to sixty issues.
    From 1939 to 1941, it was relaunched in Yan'an as a monthly publication, with a total of twenty-nine issues. On December 20, 1948, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided that the Youth Work Committee of the CPC Central Committee would be responsible for publishing "China Youth" in order to guide the establishment of the New Democratic Youth League.
    At the First National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League this April, it was decided that "China Youth" would serve as the central organ of the Youth League. In order to adapt to the development of the League's work, it was decided to change it to a weekly publication starting from the twelfth issue.
    "China Youth" must inherit its glorious tradition. It is the organ of the Youth League, and as Yun Daiying said, it is also an "organ of the national youth community." Its policy is based on the instructions in the CPC Central Committee's decision on establishing the League and the resolutions of the League Congress to "guide the work of the National Youth League and organize the vast number of young people to study." Its main target readers are young people with secondary cultural levels, including young workers, young peasant cadres, middle school students, primary school teachers, vocational youth, and so on with a certain level of education. This publication carries guiding articles on current youth movements and youth work, communications on the experiences of youth league work in various regions, and various articles on youth self-cultivation, current affairs, social sciences, natural sciences, literature, and stories. In addition, there are also reader compositions ("Write Together"), a mailbox, youth movement news, discussion of issues, songs, pictures, woodcuts, etc.
    Since its publication, "China Youth" has been welcomed by the vast number of young people across the country. Since last winter, circulation has reached 150,000 copies. It has basically implemented the above-mentioned policies, but there are still some aspects that have not been done well enough. After being changed to a weekly, it is striving to improve. It will systematically reflect the dynamics of the League in various regions, introduce the experiences of the League in various regions, and make typical introductions to a League branch, a piece of work, a meeting, a League member, etc. It will provide correct analysis on issues closely related to young people such as study, wages, occupations, family, love, health, sports, and entertainment, and will also introduce the lives, trade unions, and other situations of young people in the Soviet Union and new democratic countries.
    Finally, the "China Youth" Society hopes to receive help from youth inside and outside the Youth League and from all walks of life.

    中国青年社
    举行记者招待会
    介绍“中国青年”
    【平市讯】“中国青年”社于本月八日举行记者招待会，介绍“中国青年”的历史及其方针、内容。要点如下：
    “中国青年”是中国的先进青年以马列主义的思想团结和教育青年自己一代的刊物。“中国青年”早在一九二三年十月二十日创刊，当时是恽代英主编，是中国社会主义青年团（后改名为共产主义青年团）的机关刊物。这个刊物，一直出版到一九二七年，出了一百五六十期。
    一九三九到四一年，它在延安复刊。改出月刊，共出了二十九期。在一九四八年十二月二十日中共中央为了指导建立新民主主义青年团，决定由中共中央青年工作委员会负责出刊“中国青年”。
    今年四月中国新民主主义青年团第一次全国代表大会中，决议将“中国青年”作为青年团中央的机关刊物。为了适应团的工作的开展，自第十二期起又决定把它改为周刊。
    “中国青年”要继承它的光荣传统，它是青年团的机关刊物，同时又正如恽代英所说，是一个“全国青年界的机关刊物”。它的方针是根据中共中央建团决议与团代大会决议里所指示的“指导全国青年团工作和组织广大青年学习”，它的主要读者对象是中等文化水平的青年，包括有一定文化程度的青年工人、青年农民干部、中学生、小学教员、职业青年等等，在这个刊物里，刊载关于当前青年运动和青年工作的指导性的论文，交流各地青年团工作经验的通讯和青年修养、时事、社会科学、自然科学、文艺、故事等各种文章。此外还有读者习作（“大家写”）、信箱、青年运动消息、问题讨论、歌曲、图画、木刻等。
    “中国青年”出刊以来，受到全国广大青年的欢迎，自去冬后，销行达十五万份，它在基本上执行了上述方针，但还有些方面作得不够，改为周刊以后，正在力求改进。将系统地反映各地区团的动态，介绍各地区团的经验，将一个团支部、一件工作、一次会议、一个团员等作有典型意义的介绍。对于学习、工资、职业、家庭、恋爱、健康、体育、娱乐等青年切身问题，加以正确的分析，并将介绍苏联及新民主主义国家青年的生活、工会等情况。
    最后“中国青年”社希望得到青年团内外青年与各界的帮助。
