"Three Days Clean"
    Dīng Yē

　　Little Wang also joined the collective mess. In the past, he, like some other workers, didn't want to join the collective mess, preferring to eat at home whenever he was hungry. Especially him, he loved eating randomly at small restaurants, and his wages would be gone in less than three days, leaving him penniless for twenty-seven days of the month! He didn't care if he had to eat a few pancakes with a scallion! In Little Wang's own words, it wasn't just "acceptable," but "delicious"! Because of this, others gave him the nickname "Three Days Clean." Now that he's joined the collective mess, some people said, "Little Wang is going collective! He's progressing, progressing!" But later it was discovered that he was a bit different from others joining the collective mess. Others felt that eating cold one meal and hot the next was troublesome and expensive, but he had another plan: In recent years, he owed those small restaurants over three million! He couldn't pay it off, and every month the wages he earned went straight into the restaurant owner's hands, and he didn't get a penny himself. The more he thought about it, the angrier he got: "So I, Little Wang, am working for nothing! No matter how much or how little I work, the money still goes to them! I won't work for them next time!" Someone advised him to join the collective mess, and he agreed. He had a plan in mind: "From now on, I'll work less. Just enough to cover the collective mess fee each month, leaving not a single cent. I'll see if the restaurants still come chasing after me for money!" Last month, Little Wang only went to work seven times. This made the restaurant owners even more anxious, and they started saying harsher things: "Little Wang, you're our old customer, you should have a conscience. You owe us over three million! We're just running a small business, and even our capital isn't as much as you owe! You should think of a way to pay us back!" Little Wang didn't reply. He thought to himself, "Do I owe you? It's hard to say who owes whom! Haven't all the money I've earned in these years gone to your restaurants? If it weren't for me, your shops would have closed long ago!" The more Little Wang thought about it, the angrier he got. The angrier he got, the less he wanted to go down the pit to push coal carts.

　　Since Little Wang didn't like going down the pit, he just slept in the worker's quarters. When he was tired of sleeping, he would get up and eat cold rice. Even the master chefs in the collective mess had complaints about him: "Little Wang, aren't you paying for the collective mess too? How many meals are you eating a day! That's six meals if you count this one! I've never seen a young man in his twenties always lazing around in bed. Even a woman in confinement is stronger than you!" Little Wang had a plan: he just wouldn't say anything. After eating, he would go back to bed and lie down. Even if he couldn't sleep, he would close his eyes. What was he thinking about? Some people said he was sulking.

　　Little Wang was good at sulking. Back in his hometown of Liaonan, when Little Wang was only thirteen, his family was very poor. His parents both died in an epidemic. He worked for a landlord, herding pigs. The landlord often bossed him around, and he felt resentful. With no parents, who could he tell? Once, Little Wang lost a piglet and was slapped twice by the landlord. He got angry and went to Qianjinzhai. At that time, Little Wang was only fifteen, but he was tall and strong. The coal pit hired him to dig coal in the pit. Since he was just learning to dig coal, he broke several pickaxe handles, so he "lost money" when he first started. When he got tired, he would sweat, and his throat would be parched. He wanted to go outside the work area to get some water, but the foreman saw him and thought he was slacking off, so he kicked him. He got angry again and left the Fushun mine. He didn't stay long at the Fushun mine either, because the foreman beat him on both elbows. This time, he fought back. Fighting back was a big deal, and he was imprisoned by the Japanese for more than two months. When he came out, he was as skinny as a stick. At this time, he got angry again and left the Jiaohe mine. When he arrived at Jiaohe, he saw it was the same: "So all the coal pits in the world are equally dark!" After suffering a few losses, he understood. When the foreman beat him again, he didn't say anything. He just held his anger inside, with a fixed idea: he just wouldn't work hard. Taking a dump took him an hour and a half. He thought: "Digging coal is a bad ending. Four rocks crushing a piece of meat, who knows when the roof will collapse and break my hip! I should just slack off whenever I can and enjoy each day!" Once he thought it through, he would spend one coin as if it were two. How should he spend it well? Little Wang didn't gamble, and he didn't even smoke. He could only eat. At the end of the month, he would take his wages and go to the small restaurant at the foot of the mountain to eat and drink. The small restaurant owner was good at business: "Have a pot of wine, it's quite cold!" Little Wang was a bit cold. It was February or March, and Little Wang was still wearing his tattered summer clothes, so he ordered a pot of wine to warm his stomach. Once he drank wine, he became happy. The owner saw it as an opportunity and said, "Little Wang, want another dish? Freshly weighed meat, how about some fried sliced meat!" So Little Wang ordered some sliced meat. He earned very little money to begin with, could he stand eating like this? In less than two days, Little Wang had squandered his wages. The owner saw Little Wang as a "friend" and said, "If you don't have money, put it on the account. Pay it back when you have money. An old customer won't lose out with us!" Little Wang really didn't lose out, he paid back the money monthly, but he kept overspending. His wages decreased month by month. When he couldn't pay it back, he had to owe it. Little Wang became someone who liked to eat and drink well, living for today and not caring about tomorrow!

　　When the mine was liberated, Little Wang worked a little better than before, and he earned more money. However, no matter how much money he earned, it would still be gone as soon as he got it.

　　The small restaurants still allowed him to run up a tab. Since more workers had joined the collective mess, fewer came to patronize the small restaurants. The owner became even more affectionate towards Little Wang, and Little Wang's alcohol tolerance increased. When he got drunk, he would forget to go to work. The workers in his coal-digging team often criticized him: "Little Wang, you're always drinking. You owe a lot of debt and still don't go down the pit. This isn't good!" Some even complained to him: "Last month, we didn't win the red flag because you didn't go down the pit much, which lowered the 'attendance rate'!" But Little Wang didn't say anything. His coal-digging team discussed him: "What do we do if Little Wang won't improve?" Some said: "I don't think there's a cure. The more money he earns, the less he wants to go down the pit. The problem is that he has too much money!" Some said that wasn't quite right, but they couldn't think of a good way to cure Little Wang's laziness. Little Wang didn't feel good about being criticized by everyone, so he went to the small restaurant to drink. He felt that only the small restaurant owner was his "confidant," and Little Wang often told the owner about his troubles. When Little Wang said someone was wrong in one way, the owner would say they were wrong in two ways, but his voice would be lower than Little Wang's! Little Wang felt even more justified and couldn't get along with others. Once, because he was drunk, he insisted on leaving the team and going to another team. Since everyone was voluntarily combined, they let him leave. Little Wang went to another team, but the other teams didn't want him because they disliked his laziness. This stumped Little Wang, and he regretted leaving that team. But what could he do? In the end, the mine introduced him to push coal carts on the pit-bottom tramway. Little Wang wasn't happy because most of the people who did this work were newcomers to the mine. Little Wang was an experienced coal digger of seven or eight years, so how could he do this work? In his eyes, pushing carts was a "demotion." Second, pushing coal carts was "foreign labor," and he would only get 200 points for a shift, while Little Wang would get over 300 points for digging coal! But he had to do it. This made him even less willing to go down the pit. However, he went to the small restaurant to drink every day, so the amount he owed became alarming. The owner saw Little Wang as a "friend," so he still let him run up a tab, but the food was worse than before, and the price was higher than for those who didn't run up a tab. Occasionally, he would add an extra item on the bill. Little Wang couldn't read anyway, and he didn't keep track in his head. So Little Wang's wages were taken by the owner who followed him as soon as he received them each month. Little Wang felt that it wasn't right: "Am I working for nothing!" Over time, he and the small restaurant were at odds. The owner saw that Little Wang was owing more and more each month and felt that Little Wang wasn't "friendly" enough. They started arguing. Little Wang also discovered that he was eating more expensive food than outside and that the bills often had errors. When he asked, the owner said he "miscalculated" and corrected it. "But the errors can't always be written to be more! Why don't you ever forget to write one or two items? The small restaurant must be up to something!" Little Wang figured it out. After that, he stopped running up a tab. He only worked seven or eight shifts a month. After joining the collective mess, Little Wang wanted to get back at the small restaurant. He lay in bed all day, sulking.

　　Other workers advised him to work more shifts, but he still held a grudge. Besides, he owed so much debt that he felt there was no way to pay it back, so he didn't worry much about it. He also often used the excuse that he earned less points pushing carts. His co-workers also treated him like a bum. Although he often explained, "I don't steal, I don't touch, and I don't gamble!" he felt that something was wrong. The mine's blackboard newspaper also began to criticize him:

　　　　Little Wang pushing carts is just messing around,
　　　　A strong man sleeping in!
　　　　Working only seven shifts a month,
　　　　Eating six meals a day;
　　　　Pushing less coal than he eats,
　　　　Always running backwards while pushing carts.
　　　　Owes a big pile of debt,
　　　　Can't push eight coal carts!
　　　　If things continue like this, there's no end,
　　　　It's better to go down the pit and push coal:
　　　　First, push to pay off the restaurant debt,
　　　　Second, push for a new cotton coat,
　　　　Third, the public produces more coal,
　　　　Push to be a model and get reported.

　　Someone came back and recited it to Little Wang. Little Wang said, "Report it! It won't make me thinner!" But he felt uneasy. Whenever he went out, he always avoided walking near the blackboard newspaper. Even if it was a straight path, he would go around it.

　　At this time, the mine had already established a trade union, and a cooperative had also been set up. Most miners could earn more than 200 points. At the end of the month, when wages were paid, the cooperative would be bustling. Some would go to the cooperative to buy cloth to make clothes, some would buy cotton to make quilts, and some would subscribe to the collective mess at the worker's restaurant, sometimes eating fish and meat. Little Wang was getting anxious, and the things he was anxious about were increasing: First, in the worker's quarters, the workers all bought blankets from the cooperative, and those with broken cotton quilts also replaced them with new ones. Everyone had something to sleep on and something to cover themselves with. Only Little Wang still had that pile of black cotton batting, using a brick as a pillow. Entering the worker's quarters and seeing that the beds were all covered with new things, Little Wang's was the only pile of black cotton. Even Little Wang himself felt uneasy. Lying in bed, he felt uncomfortable, as if he were lying on needles. He couldn't lie down anymore. When Little Wang went outside, it was difficult for people to see him in that half-exposed undershirt. The weather was still in March, and the morning air was cold. People were wearing new cotton coats. Seeing Little Wang, they would choke him with their silence! But they insisted on caring about him: "Little Wang! The cotton from the cooperative this time is really cheap, and the cloth is good too. Why don't you buy some to replace yours? Your cloth shirt should have been torn up long ago to be used as diapers for the kids!" Little Wang used to be able to argue when he heard these nice words: "What's the point of coal diggers wearing good clothes! You sweat when you wear them down the pit!" But now that the workers' lives were getting better, wearing good clothes was the right thing to do! Now, when Little Wang heard these words, it was as if they were opposing him! He was also anxious about the worker's restaurant. Little Wang saw workers subscribing to the collective mess and eating fish and meat. Little Wang couldn't go in because he didn't have any money. Run up a tab? You're not a member, who would let you run up a tab! The co-workers who subscribed to the collective mess often asked him, "Little Wang, is the collective mess we subscribed to better than the food at the restaurant?" They didn't know that Little Wang had already broken up with the small restaurant. This made Little Wang hate the restaurant owner even more. What made Little Wang even more anxious was that the trade union had invited a university cultural troupe from Jilin. There were men and women, who specialized in teaching the workers how to perform plays, sing songs, and learn to read. Every evening after dinner, it would be noisy in front of the trade union. Those teaching plays would teach plays, and those teaching songs would teach songs. The men and women were very lively. On mine holidays, they would perform on stage, with the workers performing their own plays, collaborating with the cultural troupe. It was very lively! Every day, when Little Wang heard the gongs and drums, he would get anxious. Little Wang used to love watching plays, and he could even sing a few lines himself. Back when he was herding pigs for the landlord, he was slapped twice by the landlord for sneaking a peek at an outdoor play. Little Wang liked to sing, but after arriving at the coal pit, the Japanese puppets didn't treat the workers as humans. They suffered all year round, so how could they have the heart to sing? Would the Japanese allow him to sing? Would the Kuomintang allow him to sing? Since liberation, Little Wang loved to sing, but he only sang old tunes, such as: "In the first month, the first month is correct, Silver spear white horse Little Luo Cheng." The tunes were too boring, and it wasn't energetic enough to sing. Later, because he was always sulking, he thought of finding some enjoyment. This enjoyment was terrible, resulting in random drinking, getting drunk and acting crazy, owing a lot of debt that he couldn't pay back, which led to this situation. Now, when Little Wang heard the gongs and drums, how could he not be anxious? So sometimes he couldn't help but sit on the hillside and look at the trade union field from afar. He couldn't see clearly, and he couldn't hear clearly. If he wanted to go closer and take a look, his half-exposed clothes would be hard to see. He thought to himself: "If I could stand in that crowd and practice singing and acting, I would definitely sing better than them!" Little Wang was telling the truth. Little Wang sang really well. But to learn to sing and act, you must first join the trade union. To join the trade union, you need two members to introduce you. But who would introduce him? No one would introduce a lazy person to the trade union. When he thought about this, he regretted it, hating himself for messing around before.

　　The cooperative was getting more and more successful, and some people put their entire month's work points into shares and became shareholders. The number of small restaurants around the mine decreased, and only a few workers still had debt relationships with them, making them unwilling to produce. Little Wang was one of them. To win them over and produce well, the cooperative held a member meeting and decided to help them.

　　That day, Little Wang was sleeping in bed when someone pulled off his blanket. Little Wang thought someone was playing with him and was about to scold them, but he calmed down when he saw it was Director Li of the trade union. He and Director Li were close. Director Li had dug coal with him in the same pit and was nicknamed "Black Li" because his face was dark. Some people said it was because he was tanned from picking up equipment in the hot summer when he was recovering the mine, and some people said it was because he stayed dark in the coal pit. The workers supported him and elected him as the chairman of the trade union. As soon as he saw Little Wang, he said that he hadn't been able to take care of him because he was busy organizing the trade union, so he came to see him. Then, he looked at Little Wang's bedding and said caringly, "Little Wang, look at your quilt. It's so tattered that it can't even cover your stomach. You should replace it!" Little Wang didn't say anything. Director Li continued, "The cooperative will first give you a blanket on credit, and then give you a set of cotton clothes on credit. After that, you work a few more shifts and deduct a little each month. You'll pay it back in about two months! In another month, you'll be able to pay off your debt." Director Li didn't say anything more, but Little Wang was more moved than anything he could have said. He only answered, "Mmm!"

　　On the third day, Little Wang put on his new cotton coat, and a new blanket was purchased on credit from the cooperative, throwing the pile of black cotton batting and even the lice into a place that no one could see. After he threw out the "black things", his mood improved, coupled with Director Li's constant conversations with him, encouraging him, and people in the same team also often criticizing him, and helping him, his thinking was transformed. That month he worked a full shift (twenty-seven shifts). When there was a lot of work in the tunnel, he could push two coal cars to the machine road. At the end of the month, he got two hundred points, part of which was deducted by the cooperative, and part of which was used to pay off his debt. The next day, a co-worker came back and told him, "You're on the news again!" When Little Wang heard that he was on the news, he was startled. Little Wang knew that there was no good news when he was on the news. But that co-worker said: "This time it is good news. The newspaper praised you. I will recite two lines for you to listen to:

    “三天净”
    丁耶
    小王也入了大伙食了。以前他和有些工友一样不愿意入大伙食，愿意自家单独的啥时饿了啥时候吃。尤其他，爱上小饭馆里乱吃七八吃，工钱领下来用不上三天，手就净了，一个月穷二十七天，哪管是吃几张尖饼就棵大葱也行！照小王自己的话来讲不是“也行”而是“也香”！这样，别人给他一个外号叫“三天净”。这回他也入了大伙食了，有人就说：“小王过集体啦，进步了，进步了！”可是后来才发觉他和别人入大伙有点两样，别人是觉到自家吃冷一顿热一顿多化功夫不算又费钱，他呢是有另个打算：这几年来他欠那几家小饭铺有三百多万了，还也还不完，每月发下的工钱，都到饭铺掌柜的手上去，自己一个也捞不着，心里越想越蹩气：“我小王算白干啦，多干少干钱还不是叫他们拿去，下回不给他们干啦！”别人一劝他入大伙房吃，他就应了。心里打好了一个主意：“以后我少上班，一个月够扣大伙食费就行，一个子也不剩，我看饭铺里还跟屁股后要帐不要？”上个月小王就下了七回，这叫饭铺掌柜的越来越要的紧了，话也越说越难听了：“小王，你是我们老主顾，人可要有良心，你欠的可过三百万啦，咱们作小买卖的连老本也没你欠的多！你还是想想办法！”小王没再回答啥，心里想：“我该你们的？说不上谁该谁的呢！我这几年赚的钱不都化在你们几家饭铺了吗？要不是我你们小铺还不早关门啦！”小王越想越火，越火越不想还，越不想还就越不下坑推煤车了。
    小王一不爱下坑，只有在工房子里睡觉，睡烦了就起来吃冷饭，连大伙房的老师傅都对他有意见：“小王你不也掏一个伙食钱吗？要一天吃几顿呀！算这顿就六顿了，我真没看见过哪有二十几岁的小伙子老在炕上耍熊，来月子的也比你强！”小王有个主意：就是不吱声，吃完了又回炕上躺着，睡不着也闭起眼睛，他想什么呢？有人说他生闷气。
    小王是好生闷气，那时候还是在辽南老家小王才十三岁，家里挺穷，爹娘都闹瘟灾瘟死了，他就给财主家放猪，东家常辖管他，他不痛快了就蹩着，没爹没妈当谁讲啊！有一回小王把小猪仔放丢了一只，叫东家揍了两个耳光，他一赌气就上了千金寨。那时小王才十五岁，个子可长的壮，煤坑就收下在坑里刨煤，才学刨煤他刨断好几回镐把子，所以才刨煤的时节小王“赔钱”。再有一累就出汗，一出汗嗓子渴的就直冒烟，他想到掌子外头找点水喝，叫大把头看见了以为他偷懒，踢了一脚，他又气走抚顺矿。到了抚顺矿又没呆长远，又叫把头打了两胳膊拐，这回他可还手了；一还手不要紧，又叫日本人给关了两个多月，出来的时候他瘦的象麻杆了，这时他才又气走蛟河矿。到了蛟河一看还是那＠样：“原来天下煤坑一般黑呀！”他吃了几回亏也就明白过来了。把头再打他，他也不吱声，心里蹩着劲，反正有个死主意，就是不使劲干活，拉泼屎也要一个半钟头。他想：“刨煤的没好下场，四块石头夹一块肉，不知那一天顶子一冒，闹个屁骨不全！还是得闲就闲，乐一天算一天吧！”他一想开了，就有一个钱化两个钱，怎化好呢？小王又不会赌，连旱烟都不会抽，只好吃吧，月底一领工钱就到靠山根的小饭铺吃喝。小饭铺掌柜的又会作生意：“来壶酒喝喝吧，天挺冷的！”小王是有点冷，二三月的天，小王还是那身破单衣，于是就来了一壶酒暖一下肚。酒一喝，人就高兴，掌柜的一看是机会就说：“小王再要个菜吧！新秤来的肉，炒个肉片好吧！”这样，小王就来个肉片。钱本来赚的很少，还能架住这样一吃吗？用不到两天小王把工钱就糟光了。掌柜的看小王是“朋友”就说：“钱没有，记上帐，有钱再还吧，老主顾还能亏着咱们啦！”小王也真亏不着，钱按月还，可是老吃冒，工钱一个月又比一个月减低，一还不上只好欠着，小王就这样变成好吃好喝，过今天不管明天的人！
    矿山才解放的时候，小王干活是比以前好了点，钱挣的比较多，不过不管钱挣的有多么多，照例还是一到手就光。
    小饭铺里还是照样的赊，有些工友都入了大伙，来照顾小饭铺的更少了，掌柜的对小王越亲热，小王的酒量也越来越大。喝醉了，就忘了上班，和他一组刨煤的工友常批评他：“小王你一天老喝酒，饥荒欠了一大堆，还不去下坑，这样下去可不大好啊！”还有的埋怨他：“上月比赛就因为你不大下坑，把‘出勤率’闹低了没夺到红旗！”可是小王也不吱声。他们刨煤小组大家合计过他：“小王死不进步咋办？”有的说：“我看没治，他钱越赚的多越不爱下坑，怪就怪在钱多上！”有的说不大对，可是也想不出好办法治小王的懒病。小王受大家批评也不大好受，又到小铺里去喝酒，他觉得只有小铺掌柜的和他是“知己”，小王心里蹩扭事常当掌柜的讲。小王说谁一个不对，掌柜的就说谁两个不对，不过声音比小王低些！小王更觉得自己有理，回来更和别人处不到一块了。有一次因为酒劲上来硬要退出小组，到别组去，本来大家是自愿组合的，退就叫退吧。小王到别个掌子去，别个小组不要他，嫌恶他懒，这一下可把小王整住了，后悔不该阻气退出那组，但是这有啥办法。最后还是矿上介绍他到坑下马机道去推煤车，小王不大乐意，一是因为干这活的多半是才到矿上的新手，小王是刨了七八年煤的老手怎能干这活，在他看推车是“降级”；二是因为推煤车是“洋工”，下个顶班也不过拿二百分，小王刨煤下个顶班要拿三百多分！可是不干也不行呵，这样他更不爱下坑了。不过小饭铺倒天天去喝酒，这样小王的帐上欠的可就惊人了。掌柜的看小王还是个“朋友”，所以还让他赊，不过菜饭比以前差了些，价钱也比不赊的高一些，间或在帐上多写一笔，反正小王也不认字，肚里也没帐，这样小王一个月的工钱一领到手就叫跟在他屁股后的掌柜的拿去了。小王越来越觉得不大象话：“我不是白干了吗！”一来二去他和小饭铺不大对付了，掌柜的一看他一个月比一个月欠的多，也觉得小王有点不大够“朋友”了。两下就吵起嘴，小王又发觉自己吃的比外头贵，帐上还常写差数。他一问道，掌柜的说是“记差了”，就改过来，“可是差不能老往多写呀！怎没忘写一两笔的呢？小饭铺一定有鬼！”小王寻思过味来了，以后他就不去赊去。一月就上七八个班，入了大伙食，小王想这样治治小饭铺，整天在炕上躺着，生闷气。
    别的工人劝他还是多下班，他心里还是蹩着一股劲，再说饥荒该的多了，在他看也没法还反倒不大愁了，又常常拿推车工分赚的少作借口，工友们也把他当成二流子看待。他虽然常解释：“我可不偷不摸也不赌啊！”可是自己也觉得有点不大对。矿上的黑板报也开始批评他了：
     推车小王净胡闹，
     挺大劲头睡懒觉！
     整月才上七个班，
     一天就吃六顿饱；
     推煤没有吃饭多，
     回回推车朝后跑。
     饥荒该了一大堆，
     八个煤车推不了！
     这样下去没有头，
     还是下坑推煤好：
     一来推还饭铺帐，
     二来推件新棉袄，
     三来公家出煤多，
     推个模范登登报。
    有人回来学给小王听。小王说：“登吧！登也登不瘦！”可是心里倒觉得不大好受，一出去老是不往黑板报那块走，明是直路，他也绕着过去。
    这时矿上已经成立了职工会，合作社也办起来了，一般矿工都能拿到两百多分，月底一发下工薪，合作社就热闹起来。有的到合作社买布裁衣服，有的买棉花作被，有的在职工饭店包伙食，有时候吃到鱼，吃到肉，小王看着真有点着急，着急的事越来越多：先拿工房子里来说吧，工友们都在合作社里买了一条毯子，棉被破的也换新了，都有铺有盖的，只有小王还是那堆黑棉花套子，头枕一块砖。进工房子一看，炕上铺的一色是新的，只有小王那块是一堆黑棉花。叫小王自己来看也不大好看，小王躺在炕上也不舒服，象躺在针尖上，他真有点躺不下去了；小王到外边走走吧，他那件露一半肉的小汗衫实在难见人了，天气还是三月天，早晨凉气重，人家都披着一件新棉袄，见到小王不说话就够小王呛的啦！可是人家偏要关心他：“小王啊！这回合作社来的棉花可真便宜，布也好，你不买些换换，你看你那件布衫早该扯碎给孩子当屎尿布啦！”这些好话，以前小王听到了还能辩两句：“刨煤的穿啥好的！穿这下坑还出汗哪！”可是现在工人生活好起来，穿好的才对呢！现在别人说这话在小王听来简直是和他作对！还有职工饭店也叫小王着急，小王看工人在里边包伙食，吃鱼吃肉的，小王没钱可进不去，赊吗？你又不是社员谁赊呀！偏偏在里边包伙的工友常问他：“小王，咱包的伙食比饭铺的伙食好坏？”他们并不知小王已经和小饭铺闹摔了，这使小王更恨饭铺掌柜的。再有比这些更叫小王着急的是职工会从吉林请了个大学文工团，里边有男有女，专教工友们演戏、练歌，外带认字，一天晚饭后就在职工会门前闹起来，教戏的教戏，教歌的教歌，男男女女好不热闹。一到矿上公休日，就在台上出演了，工人自家演，和文工团同志合演，好不热闹！小王每天一听锣鼓响就着急，以前小王是顶爱看戏的，自家也会唱两句，从前给财主家放猪的时节就因为偷看野台子戏才叫东家打了两个耳光子。小王是好唱的，可是到了煤坑以后伪满拿工人不当人，整年整日受罪，哪有心唱呢？日本人能叫他唱吗？国民党能叫他唱吗？自打解放小王就爱唱，可是唱的都是些老调子，什么：“正月里正月正，银枪白马小罗成”，调子太乏味，唱起来也不够劲，后来也就因为老闷气，才想法乐乐。这一乐乐糟啦，结果乱喝七八喝，喝醉就耍酒疯，欠了一屁股饥荒还不完，才闹到这步天地。这回小王一听锣鼓响，怎不急呢？所以自己有时也忍不住坐在山坡上远远的朝工会场子上望，望也望不清，听也听不真，有心到跟前去瞧瞧吧，就看自己这身半露肉的衣服也难得见人。他自己想：“我要能站在那堆人里练歌、学戏，定比他们唱的强！”这点小王说的一点不假，小王唱的真不赖。可是要学歌要演戏，就得先加入工会，加入工会就得两个社员介绍，但谁介绍他呢，没人介绍，一个懒蛋子进工会，他寻思到这里就后悔了，恨自己以前不该瞎胡糟。
    合作社越办越红，有的把一个月的工分都入了股，当了股东。矿山周围的小饭铺的家数减少一些，只有少数工人还和他们有赊欠的关系，搞的不乐意生产，象小王这样就是一个。为了把他们争取过来好好生产，合作社开了个社员大会，决定帮助他们。
    那天小王正在炕上睡懒觉，有人把被掀开了，小王以为是谁和他闹着玩，刚要骂，可是一看是工会的李主任，就消气了。他和李主任很亲近，李主任和他曾在一个坑刨过煤，外号叫“李黑子”。因为他脸长的黑，有人说是以前恢复矿山捡器材大夏天晒黑的，有人说是在煤坑里呆黑的。工人都拥护他，才选他当工会主任。他一看见小王就说：因为忙组织工会没有照顾到他，这回特为来看看他，然后瞅瞅小王的铺盖，又关心的说：“小王你看你那床被，破的连肚子也盖不上啦，也该换换啦！”小王不吱声，李主任又继续说：“合作社先赊给你一条毡子，再给你赊一套棉衣服，以后你多下几个班，一月扣点，有两个月就还差不多啦！再有一个月饥荒也能还净。”李主任没再说啥，可是在小王听到这比说啥都感动。也只答了一声：“嗯！”
    第三天小王的新棉袄也穿上了，新毯子也从合作社赊来，把那堆黑棉花套子连虱子都丢在一个别人看不见的地方去了。从他把“黑东西”丢出去以后，他的情绪就好起来，加上李主任不断和他谈话，鼓励他，同组的人也常常批评他，帮助他，他的思想转变了。那个月上了个顶班（二十七个），坑道上的活一多了，他一个人能推两个煤车往马机道上跑着送。月底领了二百多分，一部分叫合作社扣下，一部分还了帐。第二天有工友回来和他讲：“你又上报啦！”小王一听上报，吓了一跳，小王就知道他一上报是没好事的。可是那个工友说：“这回上报是好事，报上夸你哪！我给你学两句你听听：
     小王穿上新棉袄，
     下班晚来上班早，
     整月来个大顶班，
     坑里活计干的好：
     一人能推两个车，
     活路一多带小跑；
     三推四推马机道，
     刨煤工友更爱刨。
     咱们坑里出煤多，
     红旗竞赛跑不了；
     这件功劳有小王，
     小王推车有功劳。”
    小王听了心里挺高兴，别人见到他也都说他进步了，从前和他一组刨煤的那伙，也都欢迎小王回到他们掌子去做。本来谁都佩服小王刨煤的本领，一个人能干一个半人的活，但是大家都知道小王有个闷脾气，脾气一来就不干了，这回看小王进步了，都想念他。作完了一个月的活，小王就回到原来小组刨煤去了，小组的同志特别欢迎他，他自己也感到大家对他的友爱，明白了解放后的矿厂是属于工人自己的，工人是被人看重了，他干起活来可有劲啦，红五月竞赛他们组得了个二等红旗奖，小王也得了一份手巾，胰子，布衫和水袜子。那个月他分了四百三十多分，把小铺的帐都还了，心里头可亮啦，象开了两扇门。走在街上也没有人和他要帐了，小组长把他介绍入了职工会，还给他谈了一些工人当主人，参加工会要好好改造自己，加强生产的道理。他当天就到唱歌小组报了名，练歌子，学认字。到公休日的时候他还登了一回台，唱的是“红旗竞赛大合唱”。小王领下了六月的工薪全都入了合作社，成了大股东了，饭是在职工饭店包的，又加入了劳保，有人一提起他的从前欠帐的事，他就讲：“我那会连上街都懒得上，就怕从小饭铺门前过；这会，我一走到合作社门前就高兴，你说怎不两样？那会咱是欠人家的，这会咱是合作社的财东！”
    小王转变了的事，全矿都知道了，有个坑下的通讯员在职工生活报上给小王写了个快板：
     小王推车推的快，
     成车饥荒成车债，
     没到三月推个净，
     又添铺来又添盖！
     拿手活计是使镐，
     小王下坑把煤刨，
     刨来裤子刨来袄，
     刨的煤炭吃不了，
     合作社里入了股，
     大股东呀当的好！
     小王越刨劲越加，
     多出货来报公家，
     光身的汉子还缺啥？
     消灭老蒋安个家。
    从那以后“三天净”这个外号也没人再叫他了。
    一九四九，七，二十九，于东北矿山。
