Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 20th -- Hubei Province has largely completed its summer grain requisition work and has gained experience in grain requisition in newly liberated areas. Since the People's Liberation Army University advanced southward in April of this year, vast areas north and south of the Yangtze River in Hubei Province have been successively liberated. Supporting the continued southward advance of the army has become the most important and urgent task for the entire province of Hubei. In areas liberated earlier, supplementary requisition of last autumn's public grain began in March and April, and summer grain requisition work was widely launched in various places in early July. By the end of July, most areas had victoriously completed their tasks. For example, the people of Xiaogan and Huangpi counties handed over more than 15 million catties of public grain within half a month, completing the original plan. At present, various places are stepping up the storage of grain into warehouses or delivering it to designated locations along transportation lines, so as to quickly transport it to the front lines.

The success of Hubei Province's grain requisition work is mainly due to the people's government's implementation of a reasonable burden policy, which has been enthusiastically supported by the broad masses of peasants. When grain requisition began in various places, the policies were first widely and deeply publicized, clarifying the principle of reasonable burden of "more grain from those who have more, less grain from those who have less, and no grain from those who have none." The working principle of relying on the masses was adopted, and the masses were mobilized in the grain requisition work. Various places also adopted different grain requisition methods according to different circumstances. In the entire region, except for a few areas that were liberated earlier and where the work already had a considerable foundation, and where a relatively simple progressive method of collection based on fields, acreage and output could be adopted, the vast majority of areas were newly liberated after the southward advance of the army this year. These areas were further divided into two types: one type was liberated in the spring, or although liberated in the summer, the cadre allocation was relatively strong. In these areas, local political power had been initially established, but the rural feudal forces had not been attacked, and the masses had not been mobilized. The other type of area had just been liberated, with very few cadres, work had not yet been carried out, and the village political power was still in the hands of landlords, despots, and old Baojia heads controlled by them. According to the characteristics of the above two types of new areas, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China clearly instructed: The former type of area should adopt the method of democratic appraisal and grain allocation according to grades, with poor peasants as the core, organizing democratic appraisal meetings to reasonably allocate the burden numbers of each class, and then posting the list for public review and finalization by the masses. The latter type of area should try to use the old Baojia to work, calling on them to perform meritorious service in the grain requisition work to redeem themselves, and explaining to them the people's government's reasonable burden policy; when allocating grain, the method of mass democratic appraisal should be adopted as much as possible; after the grain number is allocated, it should be publicly announced, and the masses should be mobilized in the grain requisition work to clean up the Baojia personnel who shelter landlords and oppress peasants, and expose and crack down on despotic landlords who conceal land and falsely report.

　　军队前进粮草充足
  　湖北完成复征
  　正迅速准备运送前方
    【新华社汉口二十日电】湖北省夏季征粮工作已大部完成，并取得了新解放地区征粮工作的经验。自今年四月人民解放军大学南进以来，湖北省长江南北广大地区相继解放。支援大军继续南进，已成为湖北全省最主要最紧迫的任务。在解放较早的地区于三、四月间即开始补征去年秋委公粮，七月初各地即普遍开展了夏季征粮工作。至七月底，大部地区都已胜利完成任务。如孝感、黄陂两县人民，在半个月内即缴纳公粮一千五百余万斤，完成了原订计划。目前各地正加紧囤粮入仓，或送到交通沿线指定地点，以便迅速运往前线。
    湖北省的征粮工作能获得成绩，主要是由于人民政府实施合理负担政策，得到了广大农民的热烈拥护。各地在开始征粮时，首先普遍和深入地宣传政策，讲明“粮多多出，粮少少出，无粮不出”的合理负担原则；采取依靠群众的工作方针，并在征粮工作中发动群众。各地还根据不同情况，分别采用了不同的征粮办法。全区除少数地区解放较早，工作已有相当基础，可以采用按田亩、产量，以较简单的累进办法征收外，绝大部分地区为今年大军南下后新解放的。这些地区又分为两种：一种是在春季解放，或虽在夏季解放而干部配备较强的。在这些地区内，地方政权已初步建立，但农村封建势力未受到打击，群众还未发动起来。另一种地区是刚解放不久，干部很少，工作尚未开展，乡村政权仍掌握在地主恶霸及受其操纵的旧保甲长手里。中共湖北省委根据以上两种新区的特点，曾明确地指示：前一种地区采用民主评议、按等派粮办法，以贫苦农民为核心，组织民主评议会，合理分配各阶层之负担数目，然后张榜公布，由群众复评定案。后一种地区则尽量利用旧保甲来作，号召他们在征粮工作中立功自赎，并向他们讲明人民政府的合理负担政策；派粮时尽量采行群众性的民主评议办法；粮数派定后应公开宣布，并在征粮工作中发动群众，清洗包庇地主、欺压农民的保甲人员，揭发和打击瞒田、谎报的恶霸地主。
