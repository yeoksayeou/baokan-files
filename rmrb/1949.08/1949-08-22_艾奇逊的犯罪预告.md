　　Acheson's Criminal Overture
    He Sijing
    United Press International, Washington, 12th: "It is reported that Acheson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the United States will continue to recognize the National Government as long as such a government exists within China. Although Taiwan has been added to the territory of China, technically speaking, Taiwan is still Japanese territory pending the signing of a peace treaty with Japan."
    Regardless of whether these words are Acheson's own, they cannot scare the actions of our people's liberation struggle. We know that Acheson said in the preface to the White Paper: "If the Communist regime... attempts to engage in aggression against China's neighbors, then we and other forces of the United Nations will encounter a situation that violates the principles of the United Nations Charter and threatens international peace and security," and the United States "will request the Security Council to take action, and the United States will of course fully comply with the obligations stipulated in the Charter." (Associated Press, Washington, 12th)
    These words of Acheson are a criminal overture by the US imperialists. This crime is very likely to occur when the Chinese people liberate Taiwan, and Macarthur and his ilk will play a villain and say: "Taiwan is Japanese territory before the signing of the peace treaty with Japan." Therefore, the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan will, technically speaking from the perspective of US imperialism, be "a real or threatened aggression by the CCP against any of China's neighbors" (Associated Press, Washington, 12th), and MacArthur will probably send US troops to occupy it as Japanese territory.
    It is too laborious, clumsy, and pathetic for US imperialists like Acheson to try to change the attribution of Taiwan in today's international law by using imperialist legal tricks.
    Taiwan belongs to the Chinese people and the people of Taiwan. Unfortunately, it was stolen by Japan in 1895. The prospect of the great victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan determined the content of the Cairo Conference. The Cairo Conference communiqué declared: "Japan shall be stripped of all the islands in the Pacific which she has seized or occupied since the beginning of the first World War in 1914, and that all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Formosa, and the Pescadores, shall be restored to the Republic of China." If "technically speaking, Taiwan is still Japanese territory before the signing of a peace treaty with Japan," then Acheson and his ilk are clearly admitting that "the territory stolen from China by Japan" "is still Japanese territory." This is using imperialist legal techniques to encourage the past theft of other countries' territories by the Japanese pirates even after the defeat of the Japanese invaders. This is one aspect of helping Japanese imperialism and aggression revive. This aspect, like all others, violates the Potsdam Proclamation and the UN Charter. The US government should bear full legal responsibility for the illegal behavior of Acheson and his ilk.
    Since the return of Taiwan to China has been declared by the Cairo Conference, it should be realized immediately after Japan signed the instrument of unconditional surrender, and it has already been realized in fact. Neither the Potsdam Declaration nor the Japanese instrument of unconditional surrender said a word about Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, etc., being returned to China only after the signing of the treaty of peace with Japan. The Potsdam Proclamation stated: "The terms of the Cairo Declaration will be carried out and Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine." Article 1 of the Japanese Instrument of Unconditional Surrender states: "We...accept...the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration." Article 6 says: "We hereby undertake for the Emperor of Japan, the Japanese Government and their successors to carry out the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration in good faith..." If "technically speaking, Taiwan is still Japanese territory before the signing of a peace treaty with Japan," then the Japanese Instrument of Unconditional Surrender has been unilaterally changed by the US imperialists into a conditional instrument of surrender. However, which article and which line of the unconditional surrender contain this condition? Obviously, the technique of US imperialism, which wants to regard Taiwan as Japanese territory before the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, has no possibility of being based on modern international legal documents approved by the people of all countries. This is just the most despicable and ridiculous technique for US imperialism to preserve the last base of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, to encourage the Japanese pirates to nominally maintain Taiwan as Japanese territory, and to actually seize Japan and Taiwan as a US imperialist military base against the Soviet Union, anti-communism, and the people of the Far East.
    The complete annihilation of the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits by the Chinese people on their last base and the liberation of the people of Taiwan from the oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and US imperialism is entirely an act of the Chinese people's sovereignty and a just act supported by the people of the world. Any violent interference by US imperialism will be spurned by the people of the world and is destined to be a shameful failure. The Chinese people are fully aware that the demise of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which was fostered by US imperialism with six billion US dollars, is a failure that US imperialists will never forget, and they will never give up. However, we affirm in advance that the more US imperialists refuse to give up, the more miserable their failure will be, and the more our victory will become the courage of the oppressed people.

### 艾奇逊的犯罪预告

　　艾奇逊的犯罪预告
    何思敬
    合众社华盛顿十二日电：“据传，艾奇逊曾告参院外委会称，美国将继续承认国民政府，只要中国境内还存在这样政府。台湾虽已加到中国的领土上，但在技术上讲，在对日和约签订前台湾仍是日本领土。”
    不管这些话是不是艾奇逊本人底话，都不可能吓住我们人民解放斗争底行动。我们知道艾奇逊在白皮书序文中说过：“假若共产党政权……图从事侵略中国的邻邦，则我们和联合国其他势力必遭遇一种违反联合国宪章的原则并威胁国际和平与安全的局面”，美国“将要求安理会采取行动，而美国当然将充分遵从宪章规定的义务。”（美联社华盛顿十二日电）
    艾奇逊底这些话是美帝国主义者底犯罪预告，这种犯罪大有可能在中国人民解放台湾时发生，并且麦克阿瑟之流会扮一个黑头出来说话：“台湾在对日和约签订前是日本领土。”因此中国人民解放台湾就会在美帝国主义的技术上讲是“中共对任何中国邻邦发动真正的侵略或有侵略之势”（美联社华盛顿十二日电）了，并且大约麦克阿瑟还要派美军去作为日本领土来占领吧。
    美帝国主义者艾奇逊之流想用帝国主义的法律技术来改变台湾在今天的国际法上的归属，那未免太心劳日拙而又太可怜了。
    台湾本是中国人民和台湾人民底台湾，不幸于一八九五年被日本所窃取。伟大的中国人民抗日战争胜利底前景决定了开罗会议底内容，开罗会议底公报宣告：“使日本所窃取于中国之领土例如满洲台湾澎湖群岛等，归还中华民国”。如果“在技术上讲在对日和约签订前台湾仍是日本领土”，那末，艾奇逊之流就明明承认“日本所窃取于中国之领土”“仍是日本领土”，这是用帝国主义的法律技术，来在日寇战败后还鼓励他过去窃取他国领土的盗窃行为，这是帮助日本帝国主义、侵略主义复活的许多事实之一端。这一端也和一切其他一样违反波茨坦公报底宣告与联合国宪章。美国政府应当对艾奇逊之流底这种违法行为负完全的法律责任。
    台湾之应归还中国，既有开罗会议底宣告，那末，只要日本签了无条件投降书以后，就应当立即实现，而且在事实上也早已实现了。无论波茨坦宣言也好，在日本无条件投降书也好，一个字都没有说到台湾澎湖群岛等应在对日和约签订后才归还中国。波茨坦公告说：“开罗宣言之条件必将实施，而日本之主权必将限于本州、北海道、九州、四国及吾人所决定的其他小岛之内。”而日本无条件投降书第一条就说：“我们……接受……波茨坦宣言各条款。”第六条又说：“我们兹担承日本政府及其继承者忠实实行波茨坦宣言的各项条文……”。如果“在技术上讲，在对日和约签订前，台湾仍是日本领土”，那末，日本无条件投降书就被美帝国主义者一手改成有条件投降书了。然而这条件载在无条件投降书底那一条、那一行中呢？显然美帝国主义的技术，想把台湾在对日和约未签订前当作日本领土看，一点也没有可能以各国人民所批准的现代国际法文献做根据。这只是美帝国主义为了保存蒋匪最后一个根据地，鼓励日寇在名义上保持台湾为日本领土，而在实际上是霸占日本与台湾为美帝国主义反苏反共、反远东人民的军事基地起见的，最可耻又可笑的技术。
    中国人民之彻底消灭蒋匪残余于其最后一个根据地上，解除台湾人民所受蒋匪美帝之压迫，这一行动完全是中国人民主权底行动，也是全世界人民所拥护的正义行为。任何美帝国主义底暴力干涉，将受到全世界人民底唾弃，并注定要成为可耻的失败。中国人民完全知道美帝国主义者所一手以六十亿美元扶植的蒋介石匪帮之灭亡是美帝国主义者梦寐难忘的失败，它决不肯干休。然而，我们预先肯定：美帝国主义者越不肯干休，则他们底失败将越惨，而我们底胜利将越成为被压迫人民底勇气。
