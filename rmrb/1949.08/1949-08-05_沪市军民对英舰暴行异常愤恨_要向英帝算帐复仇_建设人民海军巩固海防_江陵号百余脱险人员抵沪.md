    [Reported by this newspaper] Shanghai News: The escape of the British warship "Amethyst" has aroused extreme indignation among the soldiers and civilians of this city, who unanimously demand settling accounts with British imperialism and compensation for our losses. Naval personnel said: We should actively plan to build a People's Navy sufficient for self-defense, not only to prevent imperialist gunboats from invading our Yangtze River inland waters, but also to prohibit imperialist navies from operating in our territorial waters, and permanently consolidate the freedom and independence of the People's Republic of China. Educators, literary and art workers, women, scientists, and young students unanimously believe that both incidents involving the "Amethyst" were directed by the British government, and we must hold them fully responsible. Comrades across the country must pursue this matter to the end. They also unanimously expressed that only by resolutely implementing the six major tasks called for in the "Liberation Daily" editorial, quickly liberating all of China, and thoroughly driving out the imperialist forces, can we avenge our dead compatriots. People in the shipping industry stated that they must accelerate shipbuilding and develop shipping to take practical action to avenge our dead compatriots. Workers at China Textile Factory No. 14 held a discussion on the 3rd, specifically addressing the Northeast-Soviet barter agreement and the British warship "Amethyst" incident, exchanging opinions enthusiastically. They unanimously agreed that these two distinctly different facts further made everyone realize who are our friends and who are our enemies in the international arena.

    [Another report] After the "Jiangling Liberation" ship was sunk, most of the crew members and passengers rescued by local soldiers and civilians have arrived in Shanghai one after another. Among the 104 crew members rescued, 71 have registered in Shanghai. Thirty-nine passengers have registered in Shanghai. Those who were injured have been sent to the hospital for treatment. The families of the killed and injured crew members will be provided with compensation according to the special injury and death compensation regulations. Specific relief measures for the families of the deceased are under study. The surviving crew members will first be given a set of clothes, assigned to ships staying in Shanghai for temporary accommodation, provided with food, and efforts will be made to find them jobs as soon as possible. Before jobs are arranged, their salaries will continue to be paid as before. Passengers are also temporarily accommodated at the China Merchants Bureau's First Wharf, provided with food, and assisted in resolving other difficulties. On the afternoon of the 3rd, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government also sent a small tugboat to the scene of the accident to salvage bodies. Passengers and crew members have expressed great gratitude for the local soldiers and civilians' courageous rescue efforts.

    沪市军民对英舰暴行异常愤恨
    要向英帝算帐复仇
    建设人民海军巩固海防
    江陵号百余脱险人员抵沪
    【本报讯】上海消息：英舰紫石英号潜逃事件，本市军民都异常愤慨，一致要求和英帝国主义算帐，赔偿我们的损失。海军人员说：我们应该积极地筹划建设足以自卫的人民海军，不仅阻止帝国主义者的炮舰侵入我长江内河，而且禁止帝国主义者的海军在我们的领海活动，永久巩固中华人民民主共和国的自由和独立。教育工作者、文艺工作者、妇女界、科学界和青年学生，一致认为：紫石英号两次事件都是由英国政府指挥的，我们要他们负完全责任，全国同胞要一致追究到底。他们又一致表示：只有坚决执行解放日报社论号召的六大任务，很快地解放全中国，把帝国主义势力彻底赶出去，才能为死难同胞复仇。航业界人士表示：要以加紧造船，发展航运，以实际行动来为死难同胞复仇。中纺十四厂职工，于三日特就东北与苏联易货协定和英舰紫石英号事件，举行座谈，热烈交换意见，一致认为：这两个截然不同的事实，更加使大家认识在国际上谁是我们的友人，谁是我们的敌人。
    【又讯】江陵解放号轮船被打沉以后，大部分被当地军民救起的船员和旅客，已经先后到达上海。在救出的船员一百零四人中，已到上海登记的有七十一人。在上海登记的旅客三十九人。其中受伤的都送医院治疗。伤亡的船员将按照特殊伤亡抚恤条例，加以抚恤。死难家属的具体救济办法，正在研究中。脱险的船员先发一套衣服，分配到留沪的船上暂住，供给伙食，并设法尽先安插工作。在安插工作前，薪水仍照旧发给。旅客也临时安置于招商局第一码头住宿，供给伙食，并帮助他们解决其他困难。三日下午沪市人民政府并派小火轮到出事地点去打捞尸体。旅客和船员，对当地军民的冒险抢救，都表示非常感激。
