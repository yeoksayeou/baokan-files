Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 31st. General Yuan Zhongxian, Commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Zhenjiang Front, issued the following statement today:

    The British warship "Amethyst," which intruded into our inland river, the Yangtze River, and our military defense line on April 20th, bombarded our military positions, and was wounded and captured by our army, suddenly escaped from the monitored Zhenjiang river surface at 10:00 PM on the night of July 30th. The Amethyst used the vicious means of sinking the Chinese ship "Jiangling Liberation" and drowning hundreds of its passengers to escape. In order to protect itself from being shelled by the People's Liberation Army, the Amethyst forcibly made the passenger ship "Jiangling Liberation," which was sailing downstream through Zhenjiang at the time, run parallel to it, separating itself from the river bank. When our army discovered that the ship was escaping and issued a signal warning it to stop, the Amethyst fired artillery, causing the "Jiangling Liberation" to be hit, catch fire, and sink. While our army was rescuing the passengers who had fallen into the water, the Amethyst rushed through the passengers floating on the surface waiting for rescue, and fired on the wooden boats rescuing the passengers, causing hundreds of passengers on the "Jiangling Liberation," except for a few rescued by our army, to be tragically drowned, and many wooden boats rescuing these passengers were also sunk. The Amethyst thus escaped our army's surveillance and escaped the mouth of the Yangtze River.

    After the Amethyst was captured by our army, the British Navy held eleven negotiations with our side in order to obtain the release of the ship. Our army insisted that the British side must admit its mistake for the criminal acts of April 20th and must be prepared to continue negotiations on the issue of apology and compensation, and then our army could consider releasing the Amethyst. This was the minimum condition for safeguarding our country's national rights and dignity. The British representatives adopted a policy of delaying time and evading responsibility. The British side's negotiation has now been proven to be a trick to wait for an opportunity to escape. Because the evidence was conclusive and undeniable, as late as July 27th, three days before the Amethyst escaped, Admiral Brind, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy's Far East Fleet, had to admit in a telegram to me: "I believe that the Royal Navy ship Amethyst entered the front-line area on April 21, 1949, without the consent of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which is a fundamental factor in causing misunderstanding. The Royal Navy ships London, Consort, and Black Swan also entered the front-line area without the consent of the Chinese People's Liberation Army." Obviously, this statement still did not admit the British warship's crime, but wanted to cover up the crime in the name of "misunderstanding," so our side could not consider it satisfactory. However, only three days later, the British warship ended and exposed the hypocrisy of the British Admiral's negotiations with a shameful escape.

    Although the officers and soldiers of the Amethyst were the murderers who bombarded our military positions, our army still maintained our army's consistent policy of lenient treatment of prisoners. Our army allowed them to send letters, supplies, and fuel from Nanjing and Shanghai, and allowed them to buy fresh fruits and vegetables in local villages and towns. Our army also searched for their two injured and missing sailors from the shore, treated them, and sent them back. But now, people all over China and the world can see how imperialists are accustomed to repaying kindness with enmity. The officers and soldiers of the Amethyst actually used the sinking of the "Jiangling Liberation" and many wooden boats, thereby killing hundreds of innocent compatriots, as the price of their shameful escape! I firmly believe that all our People's Liberation Army soldiers and all our compatriots will never forget to avenge the sacrificed, will never forget and forgive the two barbaric acts of the British warship Amethyst, and will never forget and forgive the accomplices of the British warships London, Consort, and Black Swan, as well as the deception of British Admiral Brind. The British government should not be in a hurry to celebrate the success of the escape; as long as the British government has not punished the murderers, apologized, and compensated for the above crimes, then the whole matter is still not over.

    帝国主义以怨报德
    英舰“紫石英号”无耻逃逸击沉我江轮淹毙乘客数百
    袁仲贤将军发表谈话
    深信全国军民必为牺牲者复仇
    【新华社南京三十一日电】中国人民解放军镇江前线司令员袁仲贤将军今日发表谈话如下：
    四月二十日侵入我国内河长江与我军防线、炮轰我军阵地并被我军击伤俘获的英国军舰紫石英号，突于七月三十日夜十时由被监视的镇江江面潜逃。紫石英号是用击沉中国轮船江陵解放号并淹毙其数百名乘客的凶恶手段逃逸的。紫石英号为了掩护自己不受人民解放军的炮击，强使当时行经镇江下驶的江陵解放号客轮与之并行，隔在该舰与江岸之间。当我军发觉该舰逃跑并发出信号警告其停驶后，该紫石英号竟开炮射击，致江陵解放号中弹起火沉没。该紫石英号复乘我军救援落水旅客之际，急驶冲过漂浮水面待救的旅客，射击援救旅客的木船，致江陵解放号数百名乘客除少数被我军救出外，均惨遭溺毙，援救这些乘客的木船多艘亦被击沉。紫石英号这样逃出了我军的监视，并逃出了长江口。
    紫石英号被我军俘获以后，英国海军方面为了获得该舰的释放，曾与我方举行了十一次的谈判。我军坚持英方必须对四月二十日的犯罪行为承认错误，并须准备继续谈判道歉赔偿问题，然后我军才能考虑释放紫石英号。这是维护我国国家权益和尊严的最低限度的条件。英方代表则采取拖延时间，逃避责任的方针，英方的这种谈判现已证明是待机逃跑的一种诡计。由于证据确凿无可抵赖，故延至七月二十七日，即紫石英号逃跑前三天，英国海军远东舰队总司令海军上将布朗特在致本人的电报中亦不得不承认：“余认为皇家军舰紫石英号未得中国人民解放军同意，于一九四九年四月二十一日进入前线地带，为招致误会之一基本因素。皇家军舰伦敦号，伴侣号及黑天鹅号，亦均未得中国人民解放军之同意，而进入前线地带。”显然，这个声明仍未承认英国军舰的犯罪，而想以“误会”之名把犯罪掩盖过去，因此我方不能认为满意。但是仅仅三天以后，英国军舰便以可耻的逃跑结束了和揭穿了英国海军上将的虚伪的谈判。
    虽然紫石英号的官兵是炮轰我军阵地的凶手，但是我军对待他们仍然保持我军宽待俘虏的一贯政策。我军允许他们从南京上海递送信件用品油料，允许他们在当地村镇购买新鲜水果蔬菜。我军并从岸上寻回他们受伤失踪的两名水兵，予以治疗送回。但是现在全中国和全世界的人们，可以看到帝国主义者是如何惯于以怨报德的。紫石英号官兵竟以击沉江陵解放号和木船多艘从而杀死我国数百无辜同胞，来作为自己的可耻逃跑的代价！本人深信，我全体人民解放军将士和我全国同胞，必永远不能忘记为牺牲者复仇，必永远不能忘记和宽恕英国军舰紫石英号的两次野蛮暴行，必永远不能忘记和宽恕英国军舰伦敦号伴侣号和黑天鹅号的帮凶，以及英国海军上将布朗特的欺骗。英国政府且慢庆祝逃跑的成功；只要英国政府没有为上述罪行实行惩凶道歉和赔偿，那么整个的事情就仍然没有了结。
