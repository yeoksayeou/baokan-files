    The Fifth Outer Precinct of the Public Security Bureau Successfully Completes Household Registration Through Reliance on the Masses
    [Our Newspaper] The Fifth Outer Precinct of the Public Security Bureau began its household registration campaign on June 22nd.

The precinct held an awards ceremony at the Sanjin Theater at 9:00 AM on the 5th of this month, selecting the First, Eighth, and Eighteenth Precinct Offices as model household registration units, and Liu Qingbo and 18 other officers as model household registration cadres.
