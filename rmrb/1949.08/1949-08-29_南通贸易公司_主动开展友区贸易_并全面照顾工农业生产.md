[Sub-Northern Jiangsu News] The Nantong Trading Company in Sub-Northern Jiangsu has achieved remarkable results in the four months since entering the city. When the company entered the city in February, speculative merchants manipulated the market, and prices rose daily. It immediately took the initiative to exchange materials with neighboring regions, throwing out rice, cloth, cotton yarn, and other materials to regulate the market. It purchased raw materials such as hides and cotton from rural areas and exchanged them for finished products from factories, greatly stabilizing prices. The prices of hides, matches, kerosene, and other items generally fell by 15 to 20 percent. It established the authority of listed prices and played a guiding role in the market. In the process of regulating the market, it also took care of the lives of employees and poor citizens, setting up distribution points to sell daily necessities such as oil and rice at low prices. It distributed 48,800 bales of foreign yarn to weaving households, reducing intermediate exploitation. In mid-March, the company strongly supported production, supplying Dasheng Power Plant with 420 tons of cottonseed cake, enabling it to continue generating electricity and ensuring the power supply for Nantong's light industry. In addition, it sold more than 2,000 cases of finished matches for the Tongshui Match Factory and loaned the factory 8 million RMB to restore production. When market purchasing power was weak, goods were unsalable, and credit was tight, the company supported factories, purchased finished products, and vigorously expanded sales despite a shortage of funds and difficulties in turnover. It sold 33,120 bales of various yarns and 10,000 bolts of fine cloth for the Dasheng Textile Company's No. 1 and No. 3 factories alone, while supplying 357,000 jin of raw cotton. At the same time, it also took care of agricultural production and provided assistance to rural handicraft production. When prices rose, cotton prices in rural areas were low, and grain prices were high. It released grain on the one hand and purchased cotton at high prices on the other hand, and also sold 47,000 pieces of soybean cake, and loaned yarn to rural cooperatives, purchasing various types of local cloth from rural areas at high prices.

　　南通贸易公司
  　主动开展友区贸易
  　并全面照顾工农业生产
    【苏北讯】苏北南通贸易公司，入城四个月来，成绩卓著。该公司二月进城时，由于投机奸商操纵市场，物价日益上涨，当即主动与友邻地区交流物资，抛出米粮、布匹、棉纱等物资以调剂市场；到农村收购皮花等原料，向工厂交换成品，物价大见平抑。皮花、火柴、火油等价普遍下跌百分之十五至二十。建立了牌价的威信，起了指导市场的作用。在调剂市场中，并照顾了职工与贫苦市民的生活，设立配售处，廉价出售油、米等生活必需品。配售给织布户的洋纱四万八千八百包，减少了中间剥削。三月中该公司大力支持生产，供应大生电厂棉饼四百二十吨，使其得以继续发电，保证了南通市轻工业动力的供应。另外又为通燧火柴厂代销成品火柴二千余听，前后贷给该厂人民币八百万元使恢复生产。在市面购买力不强，商品滞销，银根紧缩时，该公司在资金短少周转困难情况下，支持工厂，收购成品，极力扩展外销，单为大生纺织公司一、三两厂即推销各种纱三万三千一百二十包，细布一万匹，同时供应原棉三十五万七千斤。同时，并照顾了农业生产和农村手工业生产的扶助。在物价上涨时，农村棉花价低，粮食价高，一面抛出粮食，一面以高价收购棉花，且抛售豆饼四万七千片，并贷纱给农村合作社，高价收购农村中各式土布。
