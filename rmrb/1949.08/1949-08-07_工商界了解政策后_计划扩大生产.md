After understanding the policies, business and industrial circles plan to expand production.

Mayor Yao pointed out that not only have public enterprises developed, but private enterprises have also achieved development. After the municipal government held various industrial and commercial meetings, and after business and industrial circles visited Peiping, they planned to expand production. For example, Yuxing Chemical Factory is adjusting labor-management relations and increasing worker welfare facilities. Huaqing Flour Mill, Chengtong Yarn Factory, Wende Iron Factory, and Huacheng Match Factory all plan to increase machinery. Dongyuansheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory plans to set up another chemical factory. In short, the fundamental change in industry and commerce after liberation is that industries that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihoods and are directly related to the broad masses of the people have been rapidly restored and even developed, while industries that specialize in speculation or are not urgently needed by the people have declined or begun to switch to other businesses.

He said: The working class of Jinan has shown a new attitude towards labor after liberation. Many moving model deeds have emerged in increasing output, improving quality, saving raw materials, and making inventions and creations. For example, the workers of the power company repaired the boiler, and the power generation increased from 5,540 kilowatts (the highest load before liberation) to 6,210 kilowatts (the highest load in the five months after liberation), and now it is to be increased to 8,000-10,000 kilowatts. The four factories of the Industrial Bureau saved 3,294 kilograms of iron from October last year to July this year. Before the Huaihai Campaign, the sand-turning department of the Industrial Bureau's Factory No. 1 could only melt three or four kilograms of iron with six kilograms of coke, but now it can melt seven or eight kilograms of iron. Factory No. 2 of the Industrial Bureau created a straight-line grinder, which increased the number of templates made per day from two to eight. There are countless examples in each factory.

    工商界了解政策后
    计划扩大生产
    姚市长指出，不仅公营企业发展了，私营企业也获得发展，从市府召开各种工商业会议，及工商界赴平参观后，他们并计划扩大生产。例如：裕兴化学工厂之调整劳资关系、增加工人福利设施，华庆面粉厂、成通纱厂、文德铁工厂、华成火柴厂等均计划增加机器，东元盛染织厂则计划另设一个化工厂。总之，解放后工商业变化的根本情况，是对国计民生有利及与广大人民有直接联系的工业得到迅速恢复以至发展，而专门从事投机或不为人民所急需的行业则下降或开始转业。
    他说：济南的工人阶级在解放后表现了新的劳动态度，在增加产量，提高质量，节省原料，发明创造上，均出现了许多动人的模范事迹。例如电力公司工人修理锅炉，发电量由五五四○基罗瓦特（解放前最高负荷量），增至六二一○基罗瓦特（解放后五个月最高负荷量），现又要增至八○○○—一○○○○基罗瓦特。工业局四厂自去年十月至今年七月节省了三二九四公斤铁，工业局一厂翻沙部在淮海战役前六公斤焦炭只化三、四公斤铁，现可化七、八公斤铁。工业局二厂创造了直线磨床，使每天做样板二块增加到八块。各厂事例，不胜枚举。
