人民铁道报 news: The famous Taizi River Railway Bridge on the Northeast Main Line, which was severely damaged by the Kuomintang bandit gangs, has been officially completed on July 12th, after nearly 500 workers from the Taizi River Engineering Team of the Shenyang Railway Administration spent seven months and two days of arduous repairs since last December. The bridge is a 590-meter-long, 17-arch bridge, with all sixteen piers completely destroyed and the steel beams falling into the water. The most difficult part of the entire project was clearing the foundations of the No. 4 and No. 6 piers. The No. 4 pier was destroyed to two meters underwater, and the No. 6 pier was destroyed to more than three meters below the water surface. When the repairs began, the workers persisted in their work in the cold weather of minus 25 degrees Celsius. For example, worker Sun Zhaoxuan took the lead in jumping into the icy water and working continuously for 15 minutes while salvaging steel beams. After the bridge was repaired, it was rated as a first-class bridge after strict inspection. Its compressive strength exceeded the standards set by the puppet Manchukuo railway and could allow trains to travel at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour. The Shenyang Railway Administration awarded the engineering team a bonus of 10 million yuan (Northeast currency).

    经七个月艰苦抢修
    太子河铁桥落成
    【本报讯】人民铁道报消息：东北长大线上著名的太子河铁桥，曾遭受国民党匪帮的严重破坏，从去年十二月起经过沈阳铁路管理局太子河工程队近五百名工人历时七个月零两天的抢修，已于七月十二日正式举行落成典礼。该桥为全长五九○米之十七孔桥，其中十六座桥墩全部遭受彻底性的炸毁，钢梁跌落在水里。全部工程最困难的是清除第四号和第六号桥墩基础，第四号桥墩被炸毁至水下二米，第六号桥墩被炸毁至水面下三米以上。开始抢修时，工人们在零下二十五度的寒天坚持了工作，如工人孙兆选在打捞钢梁时，带头跳进带冰的水里连续工作达十五分钟。这座桥修成后，经过严格检查结果，评为优等桥梁，抗压力超出伪满铁规定标准，能容许列车六十公里时速，沈阳铁路管理局发给工程队一千万元（东北币）奖金。
