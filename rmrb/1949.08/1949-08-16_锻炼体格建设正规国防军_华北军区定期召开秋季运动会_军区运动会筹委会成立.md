　　To strengthen physical fitness and build a regular national defense force, the North China Military Region Headquarters and Political Department issued a notice on June 30th, deciding to hold an autumn sports meet in Beiping in October to promote and encourage mass sports activities in various units and improve physical fitness for building a regularized national defense force. The notice instructed all directly subordinate units to conscientiously carry out sports activities in the troops and prepare for the meet. In order to prevent the tendency of championism, it was specifically pointed out that "emphasis should be placed on peacetime management, education, and sports activities, making sports activities a regular part of troop life." The report on this work should be submitted to the military region before the meet, and its results will become an important criterion for evaluating the overall excellence of each unit. The units participating in the sports meet should hold sports meets separately in September at the division level for observation and preliminary selection. The military region's newspaper, "North China People's Liberation Army," published a short article emphasizing that the People's Liberation Army's sports activities are different from those of the old society, which were only for a few people to show off, have fun, and win prizes. Instead, it is necessary to promote organized mass activities that are suitable for strengthening physical fitness and military technical movements. At the same time, it called for creativity to be brought into play in accordance with the above-mentioned purpose. On August 12th, the Preparatory Committee for the North China Military Region Sports Meet was formally established, with Military Region Chief of Staff Tang and Deputy Director Zhang Zhixiang serving as the chairman and vice-chairman, respectively. Various specific preparatory work has already begun.
