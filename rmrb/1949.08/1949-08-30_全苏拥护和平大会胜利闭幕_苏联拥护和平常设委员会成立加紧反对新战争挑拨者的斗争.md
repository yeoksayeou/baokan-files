Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 29th: TASS Moscow dispatch: The All-Soviet Peace Congress concluded victoriously on August 27th. At the final session, the discussion continued on Tikhonov's report on defending peace and fighting against the instigators of a new war.

Professor Gogol of the Kiev Medical Institute said: The essence of our work as doctors is to protect human life, health, and happiness. We oppose war, which brings death, disability, and disease to millions of people. We firmly believe that we will win this struggle for peace because our country is led by the great Stalin.

The next speaker was Professor Krus, President of the Estonian Academy of Sciences. He said: The Estonian people suffered enormous damage from the German fascists for three years. The Soviet army saved them from disaster. Soviet Estonia has achieved great success in restoring and developing industry and agriculture. Our answer to the warmongers is the people's creative labor, the labor to strengthen the power of the Soviet state - the unshakable fortress of peace and security in the world.

Xu Xian, Chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, amidst warm welcomes, conveyed the fraternal and sincere greetings of 30 million Korean people to the Congress. He said: The people of both the north and south of our Republic have sent us as delegates to the All-Soviet Peace Congress. In North Korea, liberated by the great Soviet Union, the struggle for world peace is growing together with the struggle for Korean independence and democratic development.

Professor Bernal (British), a member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, said: Scientists around the world have a special responsibility to maintain peace. The movement protesting war is rapidly expanding among scientists in capitalist countries. The International Federation of Scientific Workers, representing 30,000 scientists from 15 countries, is led by the great scientist and peace fighter Professor Joliot-Curie, who has consistently opposed the use of science for war purposes.

Professor Akhusbayev, Director of the Kyrgyz Medical Institute, said: The Kyrgyz people instructed us to protest the activities of the warmongers, protest the bloody plans of the United States, Britain, and their lackeys, and urge all loyal and progressive people around the world to actively fight for peace and against the warmongers.

The famous foreman of the Ivanovo textile factory, Yarigina, continued to speak, calling on women all over the world to strengthen their unity and ruthlessly expose the American and British warmongers. She said: In order to maintain world peace, it is necessary to further strengthen the power of the Soviet state.

Journalist Zaslavsky said: We are proud that in the common struggle against the instigators of a new world war, we gloriously belong to the vanguard. Talking about the evil role played by the corrupt capitalist newspapers bought by imperialism, he said that the capitalist newspapers have become a scourge that the people of all free nations have a responsibility to eliminate. The great strength of the Bolshevik newspapers and democratic newspapers lies in their faithful service to the people, their hatred of lies, and their teaching of people to fight for the interests of the people, for peace, for socialism, and against warmongers. Our strength is great and is growing greater, but we must not be complacent for a moment. We must intensify the struggle against warmongers, against slanderers and spies. We must strike them to prevent the preparation of the evil war. We can do this and we must do it!

　　全苏拥护和平大会胜利闭幕
  　苏联拥护和平常设委员会成立加紧反对新战争挑拨者的斗争
    【新华社北平二十九日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：全苏拥护和平大会八月二十七日胜利闭幕，末次会议上继续讨论吉洪诺夫关于保卫和平与反对新战争挑拨者的斗争的报告。
    基辅医学研究所霍荷尔教授说：我们医生们工作的本质就是保护人的生命、健康和幸福。我们反对那给千百万人民带来死亡、带来残废与疾病的战争。我们坚信我们将赢得这一争取和平斗争的胜利，因为我们国家是由伟大的斯大林所领导的。
    继起发言者为爱沙尼亚共和国科学院院长克鲁斯教授。他说：爱沙尼亚人民蒙受了德国法西斯三年的巨大损害，苏军把他们从厄运当中拯救出来。苏维埃爱沙尼亚在复兴与发展工农业方面获得了巨大成就，我们对战争贩子的答复，就是人民的创造性劳动，就是加强苏维埃国家——全世界和平与安全的不可摇撼的堡垒——的威力的劳动。
    朝鲜最高人民议会议长许宪在热烈的欢迎中把三千万朝鲜人民的兄弟般诚挚贺意转达给大会。他说：我们共和国南北两部的人民选派我们为出席全苏拥护和平大会的代表，在那伟大苏联所解放的北朝鲜，争取世界和平的斗争，正与争取朝鲜独立和民主发展的斗争一同增长着。
    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会委员贝尔纳教授（英国）说：全世界的科学家负有维持和平的特别责任。抗议战争的运动正迅速地在资本主义国家的科学家中间扩大着，代表十五个国家的三万名科学家的国际科学工作者联合会是伟大的科学家与和平斗士约里奥·居里教授所领导的，他始终不渝地反对把科学用于战争的目的。
    吉尔吉斯医学研究所主任阿胡思巴耶夫教授说：吉尔吉斯人民嘱咐我们抗议战争贩子的活动，抗议美、英及其仆从的血腥计划，并敦促全世界忠诚的进步人民为争取和平、反对战争贩子而积极斗争。
    著名的伊凡诺夫纺织工厂领班雅里吉娜继起发言，号召全世界妇女加紧团结，无情地揭露美英战争贩子。她说：为了维持全世界的和平，必须更加加强苏维埃国家的威力。
    新闻记者萨斯拉夫斯基说：我们引以为豪的是在反对新的世界战争挑拨者的共同斗争中，我们光荣地属于先锋的地位。他谈到为帝国主义所收买的腐败的资本主义报纸所起的邪恶作用时说，资本主义的报纸已变为各自由民族人民有责任予以消灭的祸害。在尔什维克报纸、民主报纸的巨大力量，在于它忠诚地服务于人民，痛恨谎言并教导人们为人民的利益、为和平、为社会主义、为反对战争贩子而斗争。我们的力量是伟大的而且正越来越伟大，但我们一刻也不能自满。必须加紧斗争反对战争贩子，反对诽谤者和奸细。必须打击他们以阻止万恶的战争之准备。我们能够这样作而且必须这样作！
