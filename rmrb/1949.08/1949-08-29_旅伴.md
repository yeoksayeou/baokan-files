　　Part One Night
    Chapter Two Lina
    "I am an orphan," Lina repeated happily.
    Anna came, took Lina's hand, and led her into the house.
    Some adults were there, surrounding Lina and asking her questions: who told her to come here, where did she live. They were all adults; for the sake of conversation, they lifted her onto the table to sit, but she still charmed them.
    "No one taught me," she replied, dangling her little legs. "I have no place to live."
    She understood that they would send her home. But she wanted to stay in this house with green grass and swings.
    "I want to live here," she said frankly.
    The adults all laughed, and a man wearing gold-rimmed glasses said:
    "It should be reported to the police."
    That night she finally stayed here, sleeping in the cook's bed, who gave her a bath and cut her hair. All night and morning, the older children swung her on the swing. There were no children too young in the yard.
    The cook, while bathing Lina, said angrily:
    "Such a mother, I really want to give her a few slaps... letting the child become covered in lice, what is she doing?"
    The police came. The man with the gold-rimmed glasses called Lina aside and confidentially told her that she must tell the truth to the police, otherwise it would be bad for her: the police would take her to the station.
    "Let him go!" Lina replied. "Let him go, I am not afraid of the police."
    So she told the police that she was an orphan and had no place to live.
    "What does your mother do?" the police asked.
    "She is a ragpicker," Lina said.
    Everyone laughed. The ragpicker woman who had a little girl named Valentinka could not be found under any circumstance: she had already left this place, leaving Lina in a nursery.
    She lived there for a year. Very simple, and very humble to people. She never troubled anyone, never asked anyone for anything, and she was tolerant of everyone. Whatever she was given, she accepted happily, but without gratitude.
    She quickly became accustomed to people's care for her, and she didn't find anything strange about it, such as people giving her food, giving her clothes, teaching her to read, some women washing her clothes, cooking for her, and other women clapping their hands in front of her and singing:
     We use our little feet
     Tap, tap, tap to walk;
     With our little hands
     Clap, clap, clap to clap...
    She didn't find any of this strange.
    In addition, they also sang: "Malicious whirlwinds are blowing over our heads" and "Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves." Lina treated singing as an unavoidable obligation.
    After a year, the nursery was dissolved, and Lina was transferred to another nursery in another city. The winter here was longer and colder, and the stoves burned wood instead of coal, but everything else was the same.
    She grew up. The little girl Valentinka - that was the past, a long time ago, that was another person. She is now called Lina. She has a place to live, but no home. She has friends, but no family. Everyone cares about her, but there is no tenderness. No one insults her, and no one loves her.
    She carefully completes the tasks that people want her to do: she doesn't like to be scolded. When she was seven years old, a member of the Youth League was assigned to her.
    "Enough," he said when he heard the song "We use our little feet": "You are turning the children into idiots. They are almost idiots in your hands, they need sports."
    Lina loved physical education classes, she was the most agile and strongest child. Everyone praised her, which was a happy thing. From then on, she tried her best to do everything so that everyone would praise her.
    Seventh-grade students have a course on the constitution.
    The teacher reads a constitutional provision, and then explains it for a long time, saying how good and how just this constitutional provision is. Lina stared at the teacher, thinking: why is he working so hard to explain things that everyone understands?
    She had already lived in the fifth nursery, she was a member of the Youth League, and she was studying sports. The teacher was again talking about that set of things, but starting from the other end... He proved that the Soviet state is the most just state in the world... But in Lina's mind, there was no other country besides the Soviet state. She is a child of this country. And this country is her home, her land, her sky. She can call anyone on this land comrade. She can accept bread from anyone, and share bread with anyone. She enters any organization without fear. Whenever the conversation involves official duties and affairs, her attitude is always confident, intelligent, and witty. But when the conversation touches on her personal affairs, she avoids answering: she is not used to such conversations.
    She had two attachments to people that were almost excessive.
    After graduating, she became a physical education teacher at a railway school, and then lived in the railway staff dormitory.
    At that time, the secretary of the district sports association was Katya, who had foolish and charitable black eyes and ham-like cheeks. She had nothing to do with sports; sitting in the office made her fat. She liked Lina very much.
    "Why do you live in the dormitory!" she said. "No one serves you, and no one takes care of you..."
    She invited Lina to her home. She went. Katya's mother had three small houses, a cow, and a raspberry orchard. They sat under the cherry tree, with a kettle boiling, drinking tea. Katya's bed had fifteen pillows on it, embroidered by her mother. Lina looked at the small pillows with longing, just like she once longed for the pepper bottle when she was a child.
    "Indeed, your life is so good," she couldn't help but sigh.
    "Move in with us," Katya said to her. "Let's live like sisters. Pay as much as you can afford. Our dairy cow is very good, you will become healthy. Otherwise, look at you, you are as thin as a skeleton."
    "Move in, Lina, move in with us," Katya's mother said. "Katya likes you very much. It is not good for a young girl to live in such a dormitory. That's terrible."
    Katya's mother was a quiet person, her face full of radiant wrinkles, and her eyes were as charitable as Katya's.
    Lina moved in with them. They put a bed for her in Katya's room. Katya personally put half of her pillow on this bed. Lina drank freshly squeezed milk. Life became pleasant and comfortable. But this happy life was soon blown away.
    A childhood boyfriend of Katya's often came to see her. He worked as an assistant accountant in an organization, and every afternoon he played the pipa under the cherry tree in the orchard. Lina despised him for not being an athlete. She couldn't even tell the color of his eyes.
    One evening, when she came back, she saw Katya crying.
    "What's wrong with you?" she asked with sincere sympathy.
    "What's there to talk about," Katya replied. She held back her tears, sat there gloomily, and didn't even glance at Lina.
    Katya's mother's muttering voice came from the next room.

　　第一部　夜
    第二章　琳娜
    “我是孤女，”琳娜高兴的重复着。
    安娜来了，牵着琳娜的手，带到屋里去了。
    一些大人在那儿围着琳娜就问起来：谁叫她到这儿来的，她住在哪儿。她们都是大人；为了谈话方便，她们就把她抱到桌子上坐着，可是她依然把她们哄住了。
    “没有人教我，”她答着，摇幌着小腿。“我也没有地方住。”
    她明白他们要把她送回家的。可是她却想留在这一座有绿草，有秋千的房子里。
    “我想住在这儿，”她坦白的说。
    大人们都笑起来，一个戴金架眼镜的男子说：
    “应当报告警察。”
    当晚她总算在这儿过夜了，睡在女厨子床上，她给她洗了澡，剪了发。整晚上和早晨，大孩子们全把她放在秋千上荡着。院里没有年岁太小的孩子。
    女厨子给琳娜洗着澡，气愤愤的说：
    “这样的母亲，我真要给她几个嘴巴才好……叫孩子混身都生满了虱子，她干什么呢？”
    警察来了。戴金架眼镜的人把琳娜叫到一边去，机密的对她说，对警察必须说实话，要不然就会对她不利的：警察要把她带到局里去的。
    “尽他去吧！”琳娜回答着。“尽他去吧，我不怕警察。”
    她于是就告诉警察说她是孤女，也没有地方住。
    “你妈妈是干什么的？”警察问着。
    “她是拾破烂的，”琳娜说着。
    个个人全都笑起来了。那位有个女孩子叫华伦锦的拾破烂的女人，无论如何也找不到：她已经离开此地了，把琳娜交到一所幼儿院里。
    她在那儿住了一年。很质朴，对人也很谦逊。她不曾麻缠过任何人，无论对谁什么也不要求，她对任何人都宽容。给她什么，她都高兴的接受着，但并不感谢。
    她很快的就过惯了人们对她的照料，对那些事情一点也看不出奇怪来，比如人家给她吃，给她穿，教她念书，一些女人替她洗衣服，给她煮饭，另一些女人在她面前拍着手唱道：
     我们用我们小脚
     踏，踏，踏的走；
     用我们的小手
     拍，拍，拍的拍……
    她对这些一点都看不出奇怪的。
    此外她们还唱些：“恶意的旋风在我们头上吹着”和“起来，不愿作奴隶的人们”。琳娜对唱歌就象一种不可免的义务似的。
    过了一年，幼儿院解散了，琳娜就被拨到别的城里的幼儿院里。这里的冬天更长，更冷，炉子里烧的不是煤，而是木柴了，其余都还是一样。
    她长大了。华伦锦那个小女孩子——那是从前的，老早以前的女孩子，那是另一个人儿呵。她现在叫琳娜。她有住所，可是没有家园。她有朋友，可是没有家庭。都关怀她，可是没有温存。既没有人侮辱她，也没有人疼爱她。
    人家要她作的事，她都小心的作完它：她不喜欢人家责骂她。当她七岁的时候，有一位青年团的团员，被派到她他们那儿。
    “算了吧，”当他听了“我们用我的小脚”这个歌的时候，他说：“你们把孩子都给我养成白痴了。他们在你们手里差不多已经成了白痴了，他们需要的是体育。”
    琳娜很爱体育课的，她是一个最敏捷，最有力的孩子。都夸奖起她来，这是一件高兴的事。从那时起，她尽力的把一切都做得叫大家夸奖着她。
    七年级的学生有宪法一门功课。
    先生读一条宪法条文，然后就好久的解释着，说这一条宪法是如何的好以及如何的公正。琳娜盯着先生，想道：为什么他这样尽心竭力的来解释大家都明白的东西呢？
    她已经住在第五个幼儿院了，她是青年团的团员，是学体育的。先生又是在讲着那一套，不过是从另一端开头吧了……他证明着说，苏维埃国家是世界上最公正的国家……可是在琳娜的心目中，除了苏维埃国家以外，根本就没有别的国家存在。她是这国家的孩子。而这国家是她的家，她的地，她的天。对这地上的任何人她都可以称同志。从任何人手里她都可以接受面包，同任何人都可以分享面包。她毫不恐惧的进到任何机关里去。谈话每当涉及职务和事务上的时候，她的态度总是自信，聪明，机智的。可是当话头涉及到她的私事的时候，她就避而不答了：她不惯于这样的谈话呢。
    她有两次对人的情爱几乎都过分了。
    她毕业以后，在一个铁路学校当体育教师，于是就住在铁路人员的宿舍里。
    当时区体育会秘书是喀嘉，她有一付傻气而慈善的黑眼睛，以及火腿似的双颊。她对体育是没有关系的；坐办公室坐得使她发胖了。她很喜欢琳娜。
    “你怎么住在寄宿舍里呢！”她说道。“没有人服侍你，也没有人照顾你……”
    她请琳娜来到她家里。她去了。喀嘉妈妈有三间小房子，一只牛，和种着复盆子的果园。她们坐在樱桃树下，生着火壶，喝着茶。喀嘉床上放了十五个枕头，这是她妈妈绣的。琳娜渴望的注视着那些小枕头，就象小的时候有一次渴望着那胡椒瓶似的。
    “不错，你的生活真好，”她不由得叹了一口气说。
    “搬到我们这里住吧，”喀嘉对她说。“咱们好象姊妹似的住着。你能付起多少钱就付多少吧。我们的乳牛是很好的，你会健康起来的。不然的话，你瞧你简直瘦成一架干骨头了。”
    “搬来吧，琳娜，搬到我们这儿吧，”喀嘉的母亲说。“喀嘉非常欢喜你。一个年轻的女孩子，住在这样的宿舍里是不好的。那很糟糕的。”
    喀嘉妈妈是一个安静的人，脸上都是光辉的皱纹，眼睛也和喀嘉似的那样的慈善。
    琳娜搬到她们那儿去了。在喀嘉房间里给她放了一张床。喀嘉把自己枕头亲自放了一半在这床上。琳娜喝着刚挤出的鲜牛奶。生活变得愉快而舒适了。可是这种幸福的生活，不久就吹了。
    喀嘉童年时代的一位男朋友常来看她。他在一个机关当助理会计，每天下午都在果园里的樱桃树下弹着琵琶。琳娜鄙视他不是一个运动员。她甚至连他眼睛的颜色都说不上来。
    有一次晚上，她回来的时候，就看见喀嘉哭了。
    “你怎么了？”她带着真挚的同情心问着。
    “谈什么”，喀嘉回答着。她忍住了眼泪，阴沉的坐在那儿，对琳娜一眼也不睬。
    喀嘉母亲的嘟哝的声音，从隔壁房间里送来。
    　　　（未完）
