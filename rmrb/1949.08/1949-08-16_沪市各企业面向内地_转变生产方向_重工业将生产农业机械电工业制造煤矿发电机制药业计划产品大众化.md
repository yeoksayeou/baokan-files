　　Shanghai Enterprises Face the Mainland
  　Transforming Production Direction
    Heavy Industry to Produce Agricultural Machinery, Electrical Industry to Manufacture Coal Mine Power Generation Equipment, Pharmaceutical Industry Plans to Popularize Products
    [This Newspaper News] Shanghai News: Shanghai industrial circles are taking active actions to respond to the government's call for "smashing the enemy's blockade and fighting for the construction of a new Shanghai" with six major tasks, are carrying out production cooperation among industries to overcome difficulties, adopting domestic raw materials and finished products, changing production direction to meet needs, and developing trade with the Soviet Union and new democratic countries. The opinions and plans of dozens of manufacturers in the steel, electrical machinery, and shirt industries are reported below:
    As transportation between Shanghai and other places has gradually and smoothly recovered, about 30 steel smelting factories in Shanghai have resumed work one after another. Finished products such as round, square, and flat wire, round, square, and flat iron, round, square, and bamboo-joint steel bars, wire nails, and wood screws are being developed in North China and rural areas in the mainland. Factories that used to burn diesel oil are planning to switch to burning coal. For example, the three Martin open-hearth furnaces of Shanghai Steel Company have begun to stop burning diesel oil and switch to burning coal. In the past, imported magnesite bricks and chrome bricks were used, but dolomite will be used instead; efforts will be made to use domestic silicon steel sheets and steel plates.
    Out of 106 shirt factories, only 30 are currently operating. In order to achieve self-reliance and expand sales in the mainland, the industry has completely stopped producing 120s, 100s, 80s, and 60s export shirts, and instead uses 42s and 23s popular goods to meet the needs of the masses.
    The pharmaceutical industry is trying to exchange materials with the Soviet Union. At the same time, in order to develop drug sales, Kefa Pharmaceutical Factory is planning to expand its business to North China and Northeast China. Dajiang Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory advocates saving packaging costs to reduce costs. Kaimeike Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory is planning to shift its products to popularization and penetrate into rural areas. In addition, various industries are planning to jointly order raw materials. Xinya Factory suggested exchanging drug raw materials with the Soviet Union to solve the problem of raw material shortage. Regarding product specialization, Kaimeike Factory believes that industries should avoid blind competition and allow each factory to develop according to its equipment and strengths.
    Electrical Equipment Factories Plan to Form a Joint Production and Sales Operation
    Out of more than 270 electrical equipment manufacturers, more than 50% have resumed work since liberation, and almost all of the larger ones have resumed work. Most of the raw materials for this industry are purchased from abroad, such as silicon steel sheets, copper wires, iron plates required for motors, and tungsten wires, molybdenum wires, and lead wires required for light bulbs. In the past, they were mostly purchased from the United States and Sweden. In fact, as the Public Electric Motor Manufacturing Factory believes, "Most of these raw materials can be purchased domestically," so the enemy's blockade has little impact on the industry. The products of other motor and electrical appliance manufacturers are mostly sold domestically. Currently, in order to expand sales, they plan to develop in North China and Central China. Some factories specializing in manufacturing transformers, distribution panels, and oil switches, such as Yongxin Electrical Equipment Factory, in order to achieve "production specialization" and "product standardization," plan to form a joint operating organization to standardize specifications, make products meet standards, and enhance production and sales capabilities. In order to meet the needs of large-scale mining in the East China mining area, it is planned to concentrate efforts to manufacture generators, transformers, and motors suitable for coal mines.
    Import and Export Merchants Turn Funds to Mainland Trade
    [Another News] Many import and export merchants in Shanghai are preparing to transfer funds that were previously used for foreign trade to develop domestic urban and rural trade and invest in industrial production. Four larger import and export merchants, including Damou Import and Export Firm, have sent personnel to Zhejiang, Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Henan, southern China, and Jiangxi to understand the situation in order to further develop trade operations. In order to make industrial production serve farmers, the Shanghai Heavy Industry Department has formulated a preliminary plan to produce internal combustion power machines and various manual agricultural machinery according to rural needs, and supply them for general agricultural reclamation and cotton reclamation. It will also manufacture small lathes, shapers, and machine forging hammers for manufacturing and repairing agricultural tools and rural iron factories. The Heavy Industry Department will also jointly form the Anhui Northern Agricultural Machinery Investigation, Research and Promotion Work Team with the former Post-War Rehabilitation Affairs Management Committee, China Agricultural Machinery Company, and Rural Industry Demonstration Office to go to northern Anhui to understand the demand for agricultural machinery and tools, establish agricultural tool repair stations, and carry out the promotion and demonstration of agricultural machinery.

　　沪市各企业面向内地
  　转变生产方向
    重工业将生产农业机械电工业制造煤矿发电机制药业计划产品大众化
    【本报讯】上海消息：沪市产业界以积极行动来响应人民政府所号召的“粉碎敌人封锁为建设新上海而斗争”的六大任务，正进行同业生产合作克服困难，采用国产原料以及成品，配合需要而改变生产方向，和发展对苏联及新民主主义国家间的贸易等，现据钢铁、电机、衬衣等工业部门数十家厂商的意见及计划，分别报导于后：
    由于上海与各地交通，已逐步顺利恢复，沪市钢铁炼制业约三十个厂家，已纷纷复工。制成品如元方扁丝、元方扁铁、元方竹节钢条、洋钉、木螺丝等，正向华北及内地农村谋发展。过去燃用柴油之厂家，则拟改燃煤，如上海钢铁公司之三座马丁手炉，均已着手停烧柴油，改燃煤斤。过去用舶来镁砖和铬砖的，以白云石代替；矽钢片和钢板，力谋改用国货。
    衬衣业一百零六家厂，目前仅三十家开工，为谋得自力更生，拓展内地销路，该业原来出品一百二十支、一百支、八十支、六十支的外销衬衣，现已全部停制，而以四十二支、二十三支的大路货代替，以符人民大众的需要。
    制药业正设法与苏联交换物资，同时，为发展药品销路起见，科发制药厂正拟向华北、东北去推广业务。大江化学制药厂主张节省包装费，以减低成本。开美科化学制药厂更在计划产品转向大众化，深入农村。此外各同业正在计划进行联合订购原料。新亚厂建议和苏联交换药品原料，以解决原料缺乏问题。对产品专业化，开美科厂以为：同业间应该避免盲目竞争，使各厂按其设备、特长而从事发展。
    电工器材工厂拟组联营产销
    电工器材业二百七十余厂家，自解放以来，复工的已有百分之五十以上，规模较大的，几已全部复工。该业大部原料均向国外采购，如电机方面所需的矽钢皮、紫铜线、铁板、电灯泡方面所需的钨丝、钼丝、导丝等等，以往大都购自美国及瑞典，其实，正如公用电机制造厂所认为的“此项原料，大都可在国内购到”，所以敌人封锁，对该业影响不大。其余电机电器各厂家，出品多属内销，目前为拓展销路，拟向华北华中一带谋发展。一部分专造变压器，配电盘及油开关等的如永新电工器材厂数厂家，为求“生产专门化”与“产品标准化”，拟合组联营机构，划一规范，使产品适合标准，并增强产销能力。为配合华东区各煤矿大规模开采的需要，拟集中力量，设法制造适合煤矿所需的发电机，变压器及电动机等。
    进出口商资金转向内地贸易
    【又讯】上海市许多进出口商准备把过去用在国外贸易上的资金，转而开展国内的城乡贸易和投到工业生产中。较大的进出口商大茂进出口行等四家已纷纷派员赴浙江、安徽、苏北、河南、华南、江西等地了解情况，以进一步开展贸易业务。上海市重工业处为使工业生产为农民服务，已制定初步计划，准备根据农村需要，生产内燃动力机及各种人力农业机械，分别供给一般农垦和棉垦使用。并制造小型的车床、牛头刨、机器打铁锤等的供给制造和修理农具、农村铁工厂使用。重工业处并将所属前善后事业保管委员会、中国农业机器公司及乡村工业示范处联合组成皖北农业机器调查研究推广工作队，赴皖北了解农业机械农具需求情形，建立农具修理站，并进行农业机械的推广示范工作。
