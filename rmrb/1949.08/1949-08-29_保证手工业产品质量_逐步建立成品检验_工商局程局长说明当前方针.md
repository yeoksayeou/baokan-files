　　Guarantee the Quality of Handicraft Products
    Gradually Establish Finished Product Inspection
  　Bureau Chief Cheng of the Industry and Commerce Bureau Explains Current Policy
    [This Municipality News] The Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau convened a meeting of all cadres on the afternoon of the 26th (including some students who participated in temporary work during the summer vacation). At the meeting, Bureau Chief Cheng Hongyi conveyed the spirit of the All-Circles Representative Conference, especially the reports and resolutions of the financial and economic departments, calling on everyone to learn from Chairman Mao, value the opinions of the people, recognize the difficulties existing in our current financial and economic construction, and work hard to overcome them. In his speech, Bureau Chief Cheng, based on the spirit of the conference's resolutions, briefly reviewed the work of the past six months regarding the restoration and development of production, market management, and urban-rural trade, explaining the future direction of the work. Regarding the restoration and development of production, the facts of the past six months have proven that as long as an industry is beneficial to the people's livelihood, it has a future. Industries such as ironworking, machinery, metal smelting, rubber, and machine milling have largely been restored and developed; while industries such as antiques, foreign wines, and gold and silver ornaments, due to the reduction in consumers, can only be reduced in scale or converted. The serious problem currently existing in Beijing's handicraft production is the low quality of products. For example, the city produces hundreds of brands of socks and soaps. In the future, we must reward good ones and criticize bad ones, work closely with the Industrial Testing Institute, gradually establish finished product inspection work in a planned manner, and mobilize industry associations to establish specialized technical research institutions, strive to reduce costs, and organize the joint procurement of raw materials and sales of finished products. Only in this way can we reach out to the countryside and open up sales channels. On the issue of funds, we must first eliminate capital speculation. It is impossible to rely entirely on government support; we must encourage industrialists and businessmen to absorb idle capital to participate in production. The Municipal Finance Committee and the Industry and Commerce Bureau are preparing to form and strengthen the Production Guidance Committee and the Trade Guidance Committee to strengthen planning and overcome the blindness of production and trade. They are organizing technical research institutions; in order to solve the problem of matching the production and sales of special handicrafts, they are gathering experts to form a specialized research institution. Regarding market management, Bureau Chief Cheng first reviewed that the Industry and Commerce Bureau has not done enough in this work in the past six months, and must work hard to strengthen it in the future, and said that they are planning to establish grain and cotton exchanges. The work of inspecting and cracking down on profiteering by unscrupulous merchants has achieved certain results, but in the future, inspections should be carried out more systematically and effectively. Regarding the issue of urban-rural trade, it was pointed out that trade companies, cooperatives, and trade guidance committees have achieved considerable success in this area in the past, and in the future, this work should be carried out more proactively and systematically, establishing normal and fixed trade relations as much as possible, and under the leadership of national trade agencies, mobilize public and private forces, cooperate closely, work hard to open up sales channels, and further connect the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas.

　　保证手工业产品质量
    逐步建立成品检验
  　工商局程局长说明当前方针
    【本市讯】市工商局于二十六日下午召开全体干部大会（内有暑期参加临时工作的学生一部）。会上，程宏毅局长传达了各界代表会议的精神，特别是有关财经部门的报告及决议，号召大家要学习毛主席，重视人民的意见，认识目前我们财政经济建设中存在的困难，并努力克服。程局长在讲话中，根据大会决议的精神，简要地检讨了过去半年来关于恢复与发展生产、市场管理及城乡贸易三方面的工作，说明了今后工作进行的方针。关于生产的恢复与发展问题，半年来事实证明，只要是有利于国民生计的工业，都有前途，如铁工、机器、金属冶制、橡胶、机器制粉等行业，均已大部得到恢复与发展；而古玩、洋酒、金银饰物等业，由于消费者的减少，则只有缩小或转业。目前北平手工业生产中存在的严重问题是产品质量太低，如本市制造的袜子、肥皂的牌子，多达数百种，今后必须奖励好的，批评坏的，与工业试验所密切合作，有步骤地逐渐建立成品检验工作，并发动各行业公会成立专门研究技术的机构，努力减低成本，组织同行联合采购原料，推销成品，只有这样，才能达到面向农村，打开销路。资金问题上，必须首先杜绝资本的投机活动，完全依赖政府的扶植是不行的，要鼓励工商业家吸收游资参加生产。市财委会及工商局正筹组与加强生产指导委员会及贸易指导委员会，以加强计划性，克服生产及贸易的盲目性，正在组织研究技术的机构；为解决特种手工业的生产与销路配合问题，正集合专家筹组一个专门研究机构。关于市场管理问题，程局长首先检讨说，半年来工商局在这件工作上做得不够，今后必须努力加强，并称正在筹划成立粮食、纱布交易所。对于检查奸商投机活动这一工作，已收到一定的效果，但今后仍应更有计划有效地进行检查。关于城乡贸易问题，指出过去贸易公司、合作社、贸易指导委员会在这方面已获得不小成绩，今后要更主动更有计划地进行此一工作，尽可能建立正常的固定的贸易关系，并应在国家贸易机关的领导下，发动公私力量，密切配合，大家努力，开辟销路，进一步沟通城乡物资交流。
