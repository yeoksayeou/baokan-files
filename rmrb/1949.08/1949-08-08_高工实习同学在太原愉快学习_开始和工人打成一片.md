    Advanced Polytechnic Institute Internship Students
    Happily Study in Taiyuan
    Beginning to Integrate with Workers
    [This Municipality News] After the Advanced Polytechnic Institute Internship Team entered the Northwest Steel Plant in Taiyuan, they were sincerely welcomed by the workers. Master Shi of the Refractory Materials Plant earnestly said, "I am willing to tell you all my experience. In the past, we suffered all kinds of oppression from the Yan Faction. As workers, we had no food without skills, and we always had to keep something back. After liberation, the workers became masters, and our lives were guaranteed. Now that we are older, we must pass on our experience to you. Study hard!" In the cafeteria, there are long rows of tables seating six people each. At meal times, the spacious room accommodates more than six hundred people, making it lively and bustling. On the first day the students arrived at the factory, each person would take their meal and head to the table of their classmates. Later, they gradually became familiar with the workers and sat together with them, chatting cordially. At first, some students couldn't understand the Shanxi dialect, but recently most of them have understood it. The students feel that only the hearts of the workers are fiery and pure. Every day, when the whistle blows, the students run to the factory, sometimes doing a little work, sometimes forming a circle with the workers, listening to them recount the pain under the rule of the Yan Faction and the improvement of the workers' status after liberation. Everyone learns humbly from the workers. The older ones are called "Master," and those of the same age are called "Senior Brother." They happily teach everyone valuable experience that cannot be found in books. Being at the factory feels warmer than being at school or at home.

    高工实习同学
    在太原愉快学习
    开始和工人打成一片
    【本市讯】高工实习队走进了太原西北炼钢厂后，受到工人们诚恳的欢迎。耐火材料厂的史师父恳切地说：“我愿意把所有的经验告诉给你们。从前，我们遭受阎匪的种种压迫，我们当工人的，没有技术就没有饭吃，自己知道的总得留一手。解放后，工人当了主人，生活有了保障，现在我们年纪大了，一定要把自己的经验，传授给你们，好好的学吧！”在食堂里，是六人一排坐的长条桌子，到吃饭时间，宽敞的屋子里，容纳六百多人，热闹哄哄，同学们刚到厂的第一天，每人领了饭总是走向自己同学的桌子去，后来慢慢地和工人熟悉了，和工人坐在一起，很亲切地谈叙着。开始有的同学听不懂山西方言，近来已大半听懂了，同学们感到唯有工人的心是赤热而纯洁的。每天汽笛一响，同学们都跑到工厂里，有时作点小活，有时和工人围成个圈子，听他们诉说着阎匪统治时的痛苦和解放后工人地位的提高。大家都虚心地向工人学习，年岁长的是师父，同年的是师兄，他们很欢喜地教给大家一些书本里找不到的宝贵经验，到了工厂觉得比在学校和家庭还要温暖。
