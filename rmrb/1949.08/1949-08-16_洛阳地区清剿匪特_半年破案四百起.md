Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 15th: The Luoyang Administrative Office of Henan Province and the public security organs of its subordinate counties have investigated and solved 405 cases of bandit, special agent, and secret society conspiracies for riots in the past six months. These include 38 cases involving special agents and spies from the Kuomintang's Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (BIS) and the Bureau of Confidential Affairs, 105 cases of secret society conspiracies for riots and sabotage, 101 cases of bandit-tyrants (including bandit uprisings, killings, robberies, and the organization of fake farmers' associations), 94 cases of theft, disruption of finance, drug abuse, and 67 other cases of sabotage. A total of 1,255 rifles, 1,123 pistols, 5 machine guns, 3 submachine guns, and some other ammunition and military supplies were seized.

In January and February of this year, as the People's Liberation Army launched its campaign southward and achieved great victories, the Kuomintang reactionaries, in a desperate struggle, sent a large number of special agents into the liberated areas of Henan, colluding with local bandits and despots to spread rumors and sabotage. They also used feudal secret societies to incite armed rebellion. Our local cadres, due to a lack of clear understanding of the reactionaries' desperate struggle, developed a sense of complacency and underestimation of the enemy. In addition, they lacked a correct understanding of the policy of "punishing the ringleaders, not questioning the coerced, and rewarding those who perform meritorious service" in suppressing bandits. They failed to suppress and punish certain extremely heinous elements, allowing bandit and special agent elements to gain opportunities for development, causing us great harm. It was not until the bandit and special agent riot in Houhaizi Village, Er District, Luoyang County, in March that vigilance was aroused, and efforts were concentrated to strengthen reconnaissance work and launch a serious struggle against bandits and special agents. Because all localities adopted a policy combining armed suppression and political offensive in the struggle to eliminate bandits, special agents, and reactionary secret societies, the political awareness of the masses gradually increased, and they rose up to assist the government in reconnaissance and capture of bandits and special agents. With the close cooperation of the Party, government, army, and people, great achievements have been made in the work of suppressing bandits and counter-espionage in the past six months.

　　洛阳地区清剿匪特
  　半年破案四百起
    【新华社开封十五日电】河南省洛阳专署及该署所属各县公安机关，半年来侦缉破获匪特会门阴谋暴乱案四百零五件，计有蒋匪保密局、调统局等特务、间谍案三十八件，会门阴谋暴动及破坏活动案一百零五件，匪霸案（包括土匪暴动、杀害、抢劫、组织假农会等）一百零一件，偷盗、捣乱金融、吸毒等九十四件，其他破坏活动案六十七件。总计缴获步枪一千二百五十五支，短枪一千一百二十三支，机枪五挺，冲锋枪三支，及其他弹药、军用品一部。
    按今年一、二月间，国民党反动派在人民解放军挥戈南进连获伟大胜利之际，为进行垂死挣扎，派遣大批特务分子混入河南解放区，勾结地方土匪、恶霸，大肆造谣破坏，并利用封建道会，煽动武装叛乱，而我地方干部由于对反动派垂死挣扎认识不清，产生了轻敌麻痹思想，加上对“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”的剿匪政策缺乏正确的认识。对某些罪大恶极分子未予镇压和惩处，致使匪特分子获得发展机会，给予我们以极大损害。及至三月间，洛阳县二区后海资村匪特暴动事件发生后，始引起警惕，开始集中力量，加强侦察工作，对匪特展开严重斗争。由于各地都在清除匪特及反动会门的斗争中采用了武力镇压与政治攻势相结合的政策，因而群众政治认识逐步提高，纷起协助政府侦察及捕捉匪特。在党政军民的密切配合下，半年剿匪反特工作获得了很大成绩。
