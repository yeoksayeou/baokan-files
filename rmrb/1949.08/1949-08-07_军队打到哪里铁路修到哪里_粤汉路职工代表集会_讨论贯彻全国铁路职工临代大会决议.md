The army advances, the railway extends
Yuehan Railway worker representatives gather
Discuss implementing the resolutions of the National Railway Workers' Provisional Representative Conference

[This newspaper reported from] Hankou: The Yuehan Railway Workers' Representative Conference opened on the 20th of last month, with 48 official representatives attending. This meeting will discuss how to restore and develop production, repair bridges, support the front lines, prevent espionage, oppose bandit and special agent sabotage, protect railways, protect factories, and take over the puppet trade unions.

Comrade Ma Ziqing, Deputy Director of the Hankou Military Control Commission Railway Department and Yuehan Office, delivered a speech. He first proposed: Yuehan Railway employees should resolutely implement the resolutions of the National Railway Workers' Provisional Representative Conference: "Support the Liberation War, ensure that the railway extends wherever the army advances, restore the national railways, prepare to build new railways, and strive to build a people's railway!" He said: Restoring the national railways that have not yet been repaired, of which more than 90 percent of the task lies with the Yuehan Railway. Therefore, the task on the shoulders of Yuehan employees is arduous and glorious. He called on employees to mobilize urgently and fully cooperate with the repair teams to repair bridges first. Based on the current situation of the Yuehan Railway, he put forward several specific tasks: (1) Unite the employees, expose and eradicate the sabotage activities of bandits and special agents lurking in the Yuehan Railway, and protect the people's railway. At the same time, destroy the many adverse effects of the past puppet trade unions among the broad masses. (2) Gradually realize democratic management and overcome the old bureaucratic system and style. Implement a truly democratic style of relying on workers in thought and action. Formulate production plans and implement new scientific systems such as the responsible car system to improve work efficiency. (3) Most importantly, all workers should unanimously recognize the importance of today's tasks and complete the tasks with the attitude of masters. Wang Xuesen and Wang Zhenbiao, representatives attending the National Railway Workers' Provisional Representative Conference, conveyed the spirit and process of the conference in detail, conveyed the instructions of the responsible comrades, and introduced many typical experiences of the Northeast.

When discussing production issues, in addition to specifically exposing and criticizing the existing wage system, personnel appointments and removals, production leadership organizations, and phenomena such as corruption and waste, the representatives further put forward many positive and constructive opinions on production, such as implementing democratic management, evaluation of merits, rewards and punishments, implementation of the responsibility system, research on technology, improvement of quality, strict economy, and democratic formulation of production plans. Everyone believes that the current work of preventing special agents, protecting railways, and eliminating hidden saboteurs is also very important.

When discussing the takeover of the puppet trade union, the representatives exposed the various crimes of the puppet trade union in the past and proposed to settle accounts with them politically and economically. The crimes of the puppet trade union should be printed and distributed to various units, and the trade union and employee representatives should first conduct extensive and in-depth publicity and deliberation among the workers before carrying out the takeover. On the afternoon of the 21st, Li Huaqin, a worker who represented thousands of Yuehan Railway workers in Wudong to visit and comfort the bridge repair teams in Xianning, Tingsiqiao, and Chimagang, introduced to the representatives the many admirable heroic deeds of Yuehan workers and the Railway Corps in the front bridge repair, he called on everyone to actively produce, support the repair teams to repair bridges and open traffic quickly, set off a competition between the front and rear, and called on Yuehan Railway workers to unite closely with the commanders and fighters of the Railway Transportation Corps (Railway Corps) and learn from their hard-working spirit.

    【本报讯】汉口消息：粤汉铁路职工代表大会于上月二十日开幕，到会正式代表四十八名。这个会议要讨论如何恢复发展生产，抢修桥梁，支援前线，及防奸，反对匪特破坏，保护铁路，保护工厂，接收伪工会等问题。
    汉口军管会铁道处兼粤汉办公室副主任马子卿同志致词，他首先提出：粤汉路员工应坚决执行全国铁路职工临时代表大会的决议：“支援解放战争，保证军队打到哪里，铁路修到哪里，恢复全国铁路，准备建设新铁路，为建设人民的铁路而斗争！”他说：恢复全国尚未修复的铁路，其中有百分之九十以上的任务，就在粤汉路，因此粤汉员工肩上荷起的任务是艰巨而光荣的。他号召职工紧张动员起来，全力配合各抢修队，先来抢修桥梁。他根据粤汉路当前情况，提出几项具体工作任务：（一）职工团结起来，检举、揭穿、根绝潜伏在粤汉路的匪特破坏活动，保护人民铁路。同时在广大群众中摧毁过去伪工会的许多恶劣影响。（二）逐步实现管理民主化，克服旧的官僚制度与作风。从思想上行动上贯彻真正处处依靠工人的民主作风。订立生产计划，并推行乘车负责制等新的科学制度，提高工作效率。（三）最重要的，还是全体工友应一致认清今日任务的重要性，以主人翁的态度来完成任务。出席全国铁路职工会临时代表大会的代表王学森、王振彪详细传达此次会议的精神与经过，传达了各负责同志的指示，并介绍了许多东北的典型经验。
    讨论生产问题时，代表们除对过去存在的工资制度，人事任免，领导生产的机构，及贪污浪费等现象给以具体揭发与批评外，进而提出许多有关生产的积极建设性的意见，如实行民主管理、评功、奖惩、推行负责制、研究技术、提高质量、厉行节约、民主订立生产计划等等。大家认为目前防特护路、肃清暗藏破坏分子的工作也非常重要。
    讨论接收伪工会问题时，代表们纷纷揭发了过去伪工会的种种罪行，并提出要从政治上、经济上和他们算帐，要把伪工会的罪行印发各单位，由工会及职工代表先向工友进行广泛深入的宣传酝酿，然后来进行接收事宜。二十一日下午，由代表粤汉路武东数千工友到咸宁、汀泗桥、赤马港抢修队进行慰劳的李华钦工友，向代表介绍前方修桥中粤汉工友及铁道大队的许多可歌可泣的英雄事迹，他号召大家积极生产，支援抢修队快修桥快通车，前后方掀起竞赛，并号召粤汉路工友与铁道运输团（铁道大队）的指战员紧密团结，向他们的艰苦耐劳的劳动精神学习。
