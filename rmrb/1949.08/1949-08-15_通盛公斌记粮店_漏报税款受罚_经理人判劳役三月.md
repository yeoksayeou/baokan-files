    Tong Shenggong Binji Grain Store
    Fined for Underreporting Taxes
    Manager Sentenced to Three Months of Labor
    [This newspaper dispatch] The manager of Tong Shenggong Binji Grain Store, Xin Haisheng, located on Zhushi Dajie, Dongsi, previously made a false declaration of his spring 1949 business tax. After investigation by the First Branch of the Municipal Tax Bureau, he was given persuasive education and ordered to amend his declaration. During the amendment process, he made four more false declarations. In the end, he insisted on not amending his declaration and was willing to make a written guarantee. The Tax Bureau then sent personnel to investigate and discovered a large amount of unreported turnover. After seeking instructions from the Municipal Government, Xin Haisheng was transferred to the People's Court for handling (details were published in the May 9th issue of the Beiping Liberation Daily this year). The case has now been fully investigated and tried by the Municipal People's Court. The court found that the grain store had underreported 160,309 yuan in business (processing income) during the declaration of its spring business tax. It should be fined 1,500 jin of millet (based on the amount of rice that 60,000 yuan, the determined fine on May 8th, could purchase). The tax on the underreported business portion should be fined five times the amount, totaling 40,384 yuan. Xin Haisheng deceived the People's Government and violated tax laws and was sentenced to three months of labor.
