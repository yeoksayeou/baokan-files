　　Considering the Interests of Fishermen, Farmers, and Urban Residents
    Guandong Aquatic Products Company Yantai Branch
  　Sells Large Quantities of Northeastern Corn at Low Prices
    [Yantai News] The Guandong Aquatic Products Company Yantai Branch has transported a large quantity of corn from the Northeast to supply fishermen, urban residents, and nearby farmers in the Yantai market. From May 15th to mid-July, a total of 1,814,046 catties of corn were sold, with prices about 5% lower than general market prices. In order to take care of the farmers, avoid speculation by unscrupulous merchants, and solve the problem of low wheat prices harming farmers, the company adopted the method of exchanging corn for wheat. A total of 62,472 catties of corn were exchanged for 43,761 catties of wheat, with an average of 143 catties of corn for every 100 catties of wheat. In addition to directly selling grain, the company also entrusted the Qunsheng and Zhifu Fishery Cooperatives to sell 312,332 catties of corn on its behalf at a commission of 2.5%, allowing the cooperatives to earn 7,808 catties of corn in commissions. This not only eliminated intermediate exploitation for grain purchasers, but also strongly supported the development of fishery cooperatives and appropriately controlled grain prices in the market. In order to eliminate the practice of merchants using women and children to buy grain and sell it on the market for speculation, the company stipulated that urban residents must have grain purchase certificates and farmers must have letters of certification from village governments in order to purchase grain.

　　照顾渔民农民市民利益
    关东水产公司烟台分公司
  　大批东北苞米低价出售
    【烟台讯】关东水产公司烟台分公司，由东北运来大批苞米，供应烟市渔民、市民及附近农民。自五月十五日到七月中旬，共卖出苞米一百八十一万四千零四十六斤，在价格方面较一般市价能低百分之五。为了照顾农民，避免奸商的投机，并采取了以苞米换小麦的办法，以解决麦贱伤农的问题。计共以苞米六万二千四百七十二斤换到小麦四万三千七百六十一斤，每百斤小麦平均可换到苞米一百四十三斤，该公司除直接抛售粮食外，又以二分五厘的佣金委托群生、芝罘两个渔业合作社，代售了苞米三十一万二千三百三十二斤，使合作社得到扣佣苞米七千八百零八斤。这不仅使购粮者免除了中间剥削，并且有力的扶持了渔业合作社的发展，适当的掌握了市场上的粮价。并为了消除商贩以妇女儿童顶名等办法购买粮食到市场贩卖，进行投机，该公司曾规定市民须有购粮证，农民必须持有村政府证明信件始能卖给。
