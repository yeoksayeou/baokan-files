　　Strengthening Material Exchange Between Mongolians and Han
    Large Quantities of Inner Mongolian Furs Transported to Zhangjiakou
　　Exchange for Industrial Products to Meet the Needs of Mongolian People
    [Our Zhangjiakou Dispatch] In order to meet the needs of the lives of the Mongolian and Han people, to adjust surpluses and deficiencies in a planned way, and to strengthen material exchange, the Zhangjiakou Office of the Inner Mongolia West Mongolia Trade Administration has organized millions of catties of wool and a large number of hides, which have now begun to be shipped from Beizi Temple to Zhangjiakou. Since February of this year, the Bureau has purchased a large number of various industrial products from Beijing to meet the needs of the Mongolian people. These include more than 1,300 bolts of colored and white cloth, 50 bolts of silk, 1,600 large boxes of brick tea, more than 1,200 catties of red and white sugar, 1,000 dozens of towels and soap, and 1,800 pieces of porcelain, as well as many other stationery items and daily necessities. The total value is 39,725,000 yuan Renminbi. In June, the Bureau also signed a material exchange contract with the Beijing Trading Company worth 150 million yuan Renminbi. As of the end of July, the Beijing Trading Company had fully paid for the industrial products according to the contract. These include more than 4,300 bolts of various cloths, 3,000 catties of cotton, 2,000 catties of red and white sugar, more than 3,000 pieces of porcelain, and more than 30 other kinds of goods. The West Mongolia Trade Administration General Sub-bureau has distributed most of these industrial products to the cooperative societies of the leagues and banners under the jurisdiction of the Xilin Gol and Chahar Leagues for the Mongolian people to purchase. As for Inner Mongolian fur, in the past two months, the amount transported to the Beijing Trading Company has totaled 200,000 catties of wool, equivalent to one-third of the total value of the exchanged goods. Due to the impact of the rainy season, the current accumulation of fur in Beizi Temple, Lama Kulun, West Ujimqin League, and Central and Western Joint Banner in Inner Mongolia includes: 1 million catties of wool, more than 45,000 sheepskins, more than 1,700 cattle and horse hides, and some lambskins and cashmere. The West Mongolia Trade General Company has transferred 2,300 ox carts from various places and concentrated them in Beizi Temple and Lama Kulun. These hides and furs are being shipped to Zhangjiakou. Based on an average daily ox cart journey of 30 to 40 li and a load capacity of 300 catties of wool per cart, it is estimated that the first batch of goods transported to Zhangjiakou by mid-October will be no less than 600,000 to 700,000 catties.
