    Elementary School Students in District One Promote Anti-Electricity Theft
    [Reported by this newspaper] Since the North China Electric Power Company launched the anti-electricity theft campaign, the District One Culture and Education Section has arranged for publicity, and teachers in various schools have held discussions for this purpose; and mobilized students to prepare for publicity. The Shijia Hutong literacy class, sponsored by the Yuying students, also held a speech contest on August 1st with the theme of anti-electricity theft. The day before yesterday (the 3rd) morning, teachers and students from the Xinxian Hutong literacy class gave four hours of lectures and publicity on the streets. The Baoman students who sponsored the Baofang Hutong literacy class, used children to perform skits, pretending to be various "electricity thieves," explaining their repentance to the masses, and resolving to change. They also explained that the electric power company already belongs to the people themselves, and everyone has the opportunity to apply for electricity, so they should take good care of their own electric power company and not let it suffer losses. The propagandists also pointed out that stealing electricity can easily cause fires and affect industrial production, and hope that those who steal electricity will quickly stop this bad behavior.
    This publicity has aroused widespread attention from the masses. An old lady did not understand what "anti-electricity theft" meant. When the rickshaw driver next to her told her that it meant "opposing stealing electricity," she immediately said, "Still stealing electricity now, that's just too unconscionable!"

    一区小学生宣传反窃电
    【本报讯】自从华北电业公司发动反窃电运动以来，一区文教科即布置宣传，各校教师为此曾展开了讨论；并动员学生准备宣传。育英同学主办的史家胡同识字班，并以反窃电为题在八一举行了演说竞赛。前日（三日）上午新鲜胡同识字班师生在街头做了四个钟点的讲演宣传。贝满同学主办的报房胡同识字班，儿童利用化装表演，假扮各式各样的“偷电者”，向群众说明他们的忏悔，并且决心改过。并说明电业公司已经是属于人民自己的了，大家都有申请用电的机会，应该好好地爱护自己的电业公司，不应使它受到损失。宣传者并指出偷电容易引起火灾，且影响工业生产，希望窃电的人赶快自动停止这种恶劣行为。
    这一宣传引起了群众的普遍注意，一位老太太不懂得什么叫“反窃电”，当她身旁的三轮车夫告诉她就是“反对偷电”的时候，她马上说“现在还要偷电，真是太没有良心了！”
