　　Broad Masses Assist in Consolidating Revolutionary Order
  　City-wide Household Registration Check Completed
    Over 20,000 Reactionary Party Members and Others Uncovered
    [This Newspaper's Report] The city of Beiping's comprehensive household registration check and verification work, which began on June 20th and lasted until early August, has been completed. This household registration check was conducted under the unified leadership of the Public Security Bureau, mobilizing more than 3,480 people. The work groups were organized by police station units, conducting in-depth checks and comprehensive surveys in various streets and alleys, focusing on key areas. At the beginning of the work, extensive and thorough publicity was conducted among the masses in a planned manner, mobilizing them to actively assist and expose bad elements. Through this comprehensive household registration work, cadres have further realized the importance of household registration management in consolidating social order, overcoming the ideological view that "checking household registration does not solve any problems." It also enhanced the political awareness of the household police, making them deeply aware of the fundamental difference between the People's Government's household registration check and that of the Kuomintang. Through this comprehensive household registration check, the overall situation of the city has been clarified, laying the foundation for future management of household registration in the city. During the check, 27,957 reactionary party members, disbanded soldiers, and others were uncovered, including: 1,668 Kuomintang Central Bureau of Statistics (Zhongtong), Military Intelligence Bureau (Jun Tong), and other bandits and spies, of which 1,069 have registered with the People's Government. 320 heads of reactionary party branch offices and above, of which 233 have registered with the government and 90 have not registered (not including this registration). A total of 3,113 party members below the branch office level, of which 1,686 have registered. A total of 7,066 military personnel at the rank of general, colonel, and lieutenant, of which 6,274 have registered. In addition, 14,790 people were found to be puppet military and political bureaucrats, rumor-mongering saboteurs, those impersonating our staff, those harboring counter-revolutionaries, Japanese spies, unidentified persons, those with inconsistent household registrations, fugitive landlords, robbers, thieves, unscrupulous merchants, "gold bugs," drug addicts and sellers, those without legitimate occupations, and those engaged in human trafficking. At the same time, dozens of kinds of feudal superstitious Taoist sects were discovered, as well as many hidden military radios, ammunition, weapons, and guns. Currently, the total number of households in the city is 423,371, with a total population of 1,897,534, including 1,038,309 males and 859,225 females.
    This check has won the praise of the people of the city, who believe that the People's Government's household registration check is to check bad people and directly protect the lives and property of good people. The Kuomintang's household registration check turned boxes upside down, while the People's Government's household registration check does not take anything from residents. Many citizens have actively assisted the work groups in conducting checks, providing information, and exposing bad elements. The masses in the third section of the sixth sub-bureau exposed Liu Shenjiang, a secret agent with a gun. A rickshaw puller exposed a Kuomintang member with a gun who had changed his name and surname in Beichizi. (Guang)

　　广大群众协助巩固革命秩序
  　全市户口查对完毕
    查出反动党团人员等两万余
    【本报讯】北平市自六月二十日起至八月初的普查与对正户口工作已告结束。此次查对户口工作是在公安总局统一领导下进行的，动员了三千四百八十余人，以派出所为单位组织起普查工作组，深入各街、巷有重点的查对与普查相结合。工作开始时，有计划的在群众中进行了广泛深入的宣传工作，发动群众积极协助，检举坏分子。经过这次普查户口工作，使干部们更进一步的认识到户口管理工作对巩固社会秩序的重要性，克服了思想上认为“查户口不解决什么问题”的说法。同时也提高了户警的政治认识，使他们深切感到人民政府查对户口与国民党本质的不同。经过这次全面的查对户口工作，已将全市总面貌了解清楚，对今后管理全市户口工作已打下基础。在查对中并查出反动党团人员及散兵游勇等两万七千九百五十七名，其中包括：匪中统、军统等匪特一千六百六十八人，已向人民政府自首登记者一千零六十九名。反动党团区分部以上之负责人三百二十人，已向政府自首登记者二百三十三人，未登记者九十人（不包括这次登记）。区分部以下之党员共三千一百一十三人，已登记者一千六百八十六人。将、校、尉级军事人员共七千零六十六人，已登记者六千二百七十四人。并查出伪军政官僚、造谣破坏分子，冒充我方工作员者，窝藏反革命分子者、日寇特务、身份不明者、户口不符者，逃亡地主、抢匪、小偷、奸商、金鬼子、吸售毒品者、无正当职业者、贩卖人口者等共一万四千七百九十人。同时查出数十种封建迷信道门以及暗藏的军用电台、弹药、武器、枪支甚多。目前全市总户口数四十二万三千三百七十一户，总人口一百八十九万七千五百三十四人，男一百零三万八千三百零九人，女八十五万九千二百二十五人。
    此次查对工作，博得了全市人民的好评，认为人民政府查户口是查坏人的，是直接保护好人生命财产的。国民党查户口翻箱倒柜，人民政府查户口不拿居民任何东西。不少市民并积极协助工作组进行查对，供给情况，检举坏分子。六分局第三段的群众，检举了有枪特务刘申江，三轮车工人检举了北池子一个改名换姓带枪的国民党员。    （光）
