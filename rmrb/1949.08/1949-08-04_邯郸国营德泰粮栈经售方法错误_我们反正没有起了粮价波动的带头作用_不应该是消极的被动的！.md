    邯郸 State-Run De Tai Grain Store's Sales Method is Wrong:
    "Anyway, we didn't take the lead in causing grain price fluctuations"
    This shouldn't be passive!
    [Our Special Dispatch] The Handan State-Run De Tai Grain Store's method of selling grain is to post the selling price of grain daily, and the daily posted price is not only lower than the market price, but also lower than the surrounding towns. This has been the case for the past four months since the beginning of spring. And the grain price in Handan, like the overall trend in the region, has gradually and steadily increased, but De Tai's price has passively increased, following the city and other places. As the manager of the store said, "Anyway, we didn't take the lead in causing grain price fluctuations," which precisely illustrates the entire operating philosophy of the store.
    As a result of using this sales method, even with methods of limiting the amount of grain and the number of people allowed to purchase, it is bound to result in a large amount of grain flowing from the state treasury, causing small vendors from the surrounding villages to come to Handan to trade grain from the Handan Trading Company instead of transporting grain to Handan, reversing the old saying of "inexhaustible grain from the southeast" (the southeast refers to Cheng'an, Linzhang, and even the Yellow River). Although consumer cooperatives have been generally established in the city for workers, poor people, and handicraft workers, the actual demand is still greater than the supply. Besides getting some cheap prices from De Tai, some still have to endure the exploitation of high prices from private merchants. Therefore, private merchants watch De Tai's "posted price" every day to set their own prices, or buy from De Tai today and sell tomorrow. Sometimes, of course, they will also transport grain out of the city to sell and seek profits. In order to buy grain from De Tai, there have been instances of grain vendors disguising themselves as citizens, bringing more people at once, placing large carts outside the city, and then buying a certain amount in several batches and loading it onto the carts to transport it away. At the end of last year, De Tai sold off 1.1 million catties of grain, but less than one-tenth of it went directly to consumers, and the rest was bought cheaply and sold expensively by private merchants. The reporter believes that De Tai Grain Store's starting point of selling physical goods to stabilize prices and striving to directly supply consumers is good, but the result is exactly the opposite. This sales method is wrong, failing to proceed from specific circumstances of time and place, and is bound to lead to this bad consequence. It lacks vigilance and necessary struggle against the speculative behavior of private merchants, and is therefore right-leaning. So it is inevitable to be beaten. For a city like Handan that is not too large, local sales should be mainly done by directly delivering grain to consumers in order to replenish the lowest level foundation to achieve the purpose of stabilizing prices. At the same time, it will avoid wasting efforts. Otherwise, unprincipled and unplanned sales will only promote the activities of speculative capital and harm the interests of the working people. This situation may seem like a local problem, but in terms of operating ideas and methods, it is not a local problem, but an isolated economic work that does not rely solely on capital, does not study specific situations, and does not combine the strength of all parties (such as unity with Handan public-owned stores). Otherwise, mistakes are bound to be made. Because such a result is actually a laissez-faire attitude towards private speculative capital, while one finds oneself in a passive and vulnerable position, which is of course a great harm to consumers.

    邯郸国营德泰粮栈经售方法错误
    “我们反正没有起了粮价波动的带头作用”
    不应该是消极的被动的！
    【本报特讯】邯郸国营德泰粮栈，经售粮食的方法是每天“挂牌”公布售粮价格，每天的挂牌不但低于市价，而且低于周围各城镇。入春四个月来一直都是这样。而邯郸粮价同全区规律一样是逐渐稳步上升的，但德泰的价格却是尾随本市、外埠之后被动的逐步上升。正如该栈经理说：“我们反正没有起了粮价波动的带头作用”，这正说明着该栈整个经营思想的全貌。
    使用这样经售方法的结果，无论用了限粮数限人数的办法出售，也势必不能约束巨额的粮食由国库向外流，而使得四乡的小贩不是把粮食运往邯郸来，而是争相来从邯郸贸易公司把粮食运往四乡，颠翻了“吃不尽的东南粮”的旧规律（东南是指成安、临漳直至黄河边）。该市工人、贫民、手工业者虽然消费合作社已普遍成立，而实际上需要还是供不应求的，除了可以由德泰定价中得到一些便宜，有的还是不得不受私商高价的削剥。而私商因此也就每天看着德泰的“挂牌”来定自己的价，或者今天买了德泰的明天去卖，有时当然也会把粮食运往市外去卖，而谋取利润。为了买德泰的粮食，曾出现粮食小贩化装成市民，一次多来些人，把大车放在市外，然后分几次几起买成一个数目装到大车上运了走，去年年底德泰曾抛售粮食一百一十万斤，而直接到了消费者手中尚不足十分之一的数目，其他均为私商贱买贵卖了。记者认为德泰粮栈抛售实物以求平稳物价，并力谋直接供给消费者的出发点是好的，但结果却恰恰是相反的。这种经售方法是错误的，没有从时间、地点具体情况出发，当然要招致这种不良的后果，对于私商的投机行为缺乏警惕和必要的斗争，因而是右倾的。所以挨打就不可免。就邯郸这样一个不算大的城市来说，局部抛售应该做到直接交到消费者手中为主要的经售方法，由此来充实最下层基础才能达到平稳物价的目的，同时也才能不致浪费力量，否则无原则无计划的抛售，只能助长投机资本的活动，损害了劳动人民的利益。这一情况，看起来仿佛是一个局部问题，但实际上若就经营的思想和方法来说，那就不是一个局部问题，而是一个不能单凭资本、不研究具体情况，不结合各方面力量（如对邯郸公营商店的团结）而孤立的作经济工作，否则，一定要犯错误。因为这样的结果，实际对于私人投机资本是一种放任，而自己却反而站到了被动挨打的地位，对于消费者当然是一个极大的损害。
