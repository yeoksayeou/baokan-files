Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 31st: Warsaw, Polish News Agency, 29th -- "The traitorous Tito clique, after betraying the anti-imperialist camp, has already colluded with US and British imperialism." This is the preface to a resolution passed at a recent meeting of Yugoslav communist party members exiled in Poland. The resolution continued: the Tito clique is leading the country to complete subjugation to US and British imperialism, granting foreign capitalists many key positions in the national economy. The Tito clique has also adopted a program of open hostility towards the international proletariat, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries. Another clear piece of evidence of the path taken by the Tito clique is its friendly policy towards the Greek royalist fascists and its conspiracies in Trieste. The resolution then described the terror engulfing all parts of Yugoslavia, the plight of the Yugoslav working class, and the economic dependence of the peasants on the wealthy peasants.

The resolution continued: The Tito clique has shamelessly demanded that the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries prohibit the activities of Yugoslav political exiles, a demand that constitutes an open provocation. Yugoslav revolutionary exiles now residing in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria enjoy the right of asylum guaranteed by the constitutions of these countries. The assistance and protection these countries have shown to Yugoslav exiles proves their friendship towards the Yugoslav people and proletarian internationalism. Our group, by publishing the journal "Struggle for Victory" and participating in the struggles carried out by newspapers such as "New Combat News," "Under the Banner of Internationalism," and "Forward," is exposing the imperialist lackeys, the Tito clique, who are attempting to turn our country into a military base for warmongers.

The resolution concluded by paying tribute to the Yugoslav people fighting for friendship and brotherhood with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, calling for a struggle against Tito and his Trotskyist clique, and hailing the unity of the international proletariat, the Communist Information Bureau, and Stalin.

    波境南共党员斥责铁托卖国
    【新华社北平三十一日电】波兰通讯社华沙二十九日讯：“叛逆的铁托集团在背叛了反帝国主义阵营之后，已经与美英帝国主义勾结在一起”。这是流亡波兰的南斯拉夫共产党员在其最近的会议上所通过的决议的序言。决议继称：铁托集团把国家导向完全受制于美英帝国主义之下，给予外国资本家以国民经济中的许多主要阵地。铁托集团也采取了公开敌视国际无产阶级、苏联与人民民主国家的纲领。另一证明铁托集团所走的道路的明显证据，就是它对希腊保皇法西斯的友善政策及其在的里雅斯特的阴谋。决议进而描述笼罩着南斯拉夫各地的恐怖，南斯拉夫工人阶级的困境和农民在经济上对富农的依赖。
    决议继称：铁托集团曾无耻地要求苏联和人民民主国家禁止南斯拉夫政治流亡者的活动，这种要求是一种公开的挑衅。现在在苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚和保加利亚的南斯拉夫革命流亡者，享受着这些国家的宪法所保障的避难权利。这些国家对南斯拉夫流亡者所表示的援助与保护，证明了他们对南斯拉夫人民和对无产阶级国际主义的友谊。我们这一群以出版“争取胜利”期刊，并参加“新战斗报”“在国际主义旗帜下”和“前进”等报刊所进行的斗争，来揭露帝国主义的走狗——铁托集团试图把我国变为战争贩子的军事基地。
    决议最后向为争取对苏联和人民民主国家的友好与兄弟之谊而战斗的南斯拉夫人民致敬，号召为反对铁托及其托洛斯基集团而斗争，并为国际无产阶级的团结、为共产党情报局和为斯大林而欢呼。
