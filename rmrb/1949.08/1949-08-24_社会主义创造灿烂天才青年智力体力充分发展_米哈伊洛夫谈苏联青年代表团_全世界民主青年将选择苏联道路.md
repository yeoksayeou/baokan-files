Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd - According to TASS, Budapest: Mikhailov, head of the Soviet youth delegation, gave a brief introduction to the Soviet delegation at a press conference held here on the 18th, stating:

The Soviet youth delegation reflects the moral, ideological, and cultural aspects of our young generation, nurtured with great care by the Communist Party and Comrade Stalin. It clearly illustrates that the socialist system has opened up limitless prospects for the development of the spirit, intelligence, culture, and physical strength of youth, and has enabled millions upon millions of young people to fully develop their creativity and talent.

In the Soviet Union, 34 million young people are studying in four-year, seven-year, and ten-year schools, and more than one million young people are studying in higher education institutions. In the Russian Federation alone, 170 million textbooks will be published this year. Throughout the Soviet Union, more than 800 theaters, 875 museums and exhibition halls, more than 111,000 clubs, 60,000 public libraries, more than 28,000 cinemas, and 740 music, art, and drama schools are specifically established for young people.

The Soviet Young Pioneer organization - the Communist Youth League - now has approximately 10 million members, publishes 90 newspapers with a total circulation of 5 million copies, and publishes 22 magazines with a circulation of approximately 1 million copies. The Young Guards Publishing House alone will publish more than 15 million books this year.

The art troupe, musicians, actors, and athletes in the Soviet delegation demonstrate the new brilliant talent of the Soviet Union, which precisely originates from the people, because the Soviet government and the Bolshevik Party have created all the conditions for the development of talented youth. Audiences attending the Soviet delegation's concerts can see that each Soviet Union republic has its own outstanding young musicians.

The purpose of the Communist Party is to eliminate the division between intellectual and physical labor. This is a necessary condition for building a communist society. The Soviet delegation includes many ordinary workers, such as members of the Stalin Automobile Factory choir and members of the Sverdlovsk song and dance troupe, as well as members of the folk instrument orchestra of vocational and industrial training schools.

A new type of worker has emerged in the Soviet Union. He is an educated person with lofty ideals, a broad perspective, and a high degree of culture, who is not only interested in his own profession, but also in politics, literature, and art. For example, workers can lecture to students in higher education institutions, they can cooperate with outstanding engineers and technicians to create new technologies, and hundreds of thousands of ordinary collective farmers can actively participate in field experiments.

Finally, we believe that the World Democratic Youth Festival is an event of great political importance, a demonstration of the solidarity and unity of the forces of progressive youth around the world. It will once again help the world's democratic youth distinguish between friends and enemies, and recognize which path is correct for youth, and which path is illusory, disastrous, and incorrect. Democratic youth will choose the right path. Any democratic youth organization will find consistent, loyal, and always true friends in Soviet youth.

　　社会主义创造灿烂天才青年智力体力充分发展
    米哈伊洛夫谈苏联青年代表团
  　全世界民主青年将选择苏联道路
    【新华社北平廿三日电】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯，苏联青年代表团团长米哈伊洛夫在十八日此间举行的记者招待会上，对苏联代表团作一简单介绍称：
    苏联青年代表团反映着共产党与斯大林同志所亲切地培养的我国年青一代的道德、思想和文化等各方面，明显地说明了：社会主义制度已给青年开辟了发展精神、智力、文化与体力的无限前途，已使千千万万青年正在充分发展着他们的创造力和天才。
    在苏联，正有三千四百万青年人在四年制、七年制和十年制的学校中学习，有一百多万青年在高等教育机关中学习。仅在俄罗斯联邦一个共和国，今年就出版一亿七千万本教科书。全苏联专门为青年们设立了八百多座戏院，八百七十五个博物馆和陈列馆，十一万一千多个俱乐部，六万所公共图书馆、二万八千余所电影院和七百四十所音乐、艺术与戏剧学校。
    苏联青年先锋队的组织——共产主义青年团，现在约有一千万团员，出版着九十种报纸，共发行五百万份，并出版二十二种杂志，销数约一百万册。青年近卫军出版局仅在今年就出版一千五百万册以上的书籍。
    苏联代表团中的艺术队、音乐家、演员与体育家，说明苏联的新的灿烂天才，恰恰是从人民当中产生出来的，因为苏联政府与布尔什维克党已为天才青年的发展创造了一切条件。参加苏联代表团的音乐会的听众们，可看到各苏联加盟共和国都有她们自己的优秀的青年音乐家。
    共产党的目的，是为了消除智力与体力劳动的分别。这是建设共产主义社会的必要条件。苏联代表团包括许多普通工人，如斯大林汽车工厂合唱队的队员和斯维德洛夫斯克歌舞团的团员，还包括职业与工业训练学校学生的民间乐器管弦乐队队员。
    苏联已出现了新型工人。他是具有崇高理想、广阔眼界与高度文化的有教养的人，他不仅对他自己的职业有兴趣，而且对政治、文学与艺术也有兴趣。例如，工人可以对高等教育机关的学生讲演，他们可以和杰出的工程师、技师合作创造新技术，几十万普通的集体农民可以积极参加实地试验。
    最后，我们认为，世界民主青年联欢大会是具有巨大政治重要性的大事、是全世界进步青年力量的团结与精诚一致的示威。它再一次帮助世界民主青年分清朋友和敌人，认清什么道路对青年是正确的，而什么道路是虚妄的、灾难性的、不正确的。民主青年将选择正确的道路。任何民主的青年组织都将在苏联青年中找到一贯忠诚、始终真实的朋友。
