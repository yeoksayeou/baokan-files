Taihang Region's Agricultural Mutual Aid Situation and Leadership Experience in the First Half of the Year are as Follows:

I. The scale of organization is extensive. In the agricultural field, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the Taihang Region has a foundation. The scale of organization this year is much more extensive than in previous years. For example, in a survey of 46 villages in Huguan County last May, farmers truly involved in the mutual aid movement accounted for 25.7% of the total households. This year, according to statistics from 482 villages in Pingshun, Changzhi, Lingchuan, Xingtai, Zanhuang, Neiqiu, and Shexian counties, a total of 79,000 households were involved in the mutual aid movement, with 49,770 households actually participating in mutual aid, averaging 63% of the total. Furthermore, according to statistics from six villages in Huguan, Licheng, Xingtai, Changzhi, and Xiyang counties, farmers involved in the mutual aid movement accounted for 31.7% of the total households. Statistics from 150 villages in Xingtai showed that the scale of organization in the summer harvest was even larger, accounting for 81.7% of the total households. The result of widespread organization has played a significant role in improving agricultural productivity. For example, in Shili Village, Huguan County, in addition to meticulous farming, mutual aid enabled the reclamation of 120 mu of wasteland, expanding the cultivated area. In the agricultural field, the call to organize and develop production has truly become a mass movement in the Taihang Region. There are two reasons why the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement can develop so extensively: (1) After the land reform, the means of production tended to be dispersed. In order to develop production, farmers objectively urgently needed to organize. For example, a survey of 13 villages in eight counties, totaling 9,376 households and 31,762 mu of land, showed that households with both labor and livestock accounted for 42.7%, households with labor but no livestock accounted for 31.85%, households with livestock but no labor accounted for 5.25%, and households with neither labor nor livestock accounted for 20.2%. This shows that without organization, it would be impossible to successfully complete the task of increasing production by 10%. As the masses in Nanyu Village, Wuxiang County, reflected: "Don't be afraid of not having mutual aid (referring to what the cadres said). Now there are too many households with ample manpower. Without mutual aid, we can't work." (2) The various forms of disguised coercion in previous organization policies were strictly corrected, and the policy of supporting all forms of mutual aid that are truly favored and voluntary by the masses, regardless of size, as long as they are conducive to the development of production, was conscientiously implemented. In short, the most fundamental reason why the organization could develop so extensively in the first half of the year was the combination of the objective requirements of the masses for organization and the correct implementation of the organization policy.

II. The forms of organization are diverse. Because the forms of organization are diverse and the members participating are numerous, the productivity is also enormous. Here are a few examples of its organizational forms: The first type is a mutual aid group led by a Communist Party member or labor hero that has never collapsed over the years. For example, the mutual aid group led by Communist Party member and labor hero Zhao FuKui in Heshan Village, Heshun County, has five households, five laborers, six cattle, three donkeys, and more than 80 mu of land. They are all emancipated peasants. Among them, there is a stonemason, a carpenter, and an old man who has grown vegetable gardens and knows a lot about technology. They have been organized for production since 1942 and have never dispersed. Each member feels that mutual aid has three major benefits: (1) Rationalization of labor use. For example, the entire group has a unified farming plan according to the season and a unified method of allocating labor. For example, one person is drawn out to drive livestock for transportation all year round, supplying the entire group with coal, etc., which makes production convenient in all aspects. (2) The group has an old man who is proficient in agricultural technology as a consultant, which greatly benefits each member in improving technology and developing production. (3) The entire group is fair and generous, using work points to calculate work, and settling once a season, and settling long-term debts with physical objects after the autumn harvest. There are quite a few such mutual aid groups in the old liberated areas. According to surveys, they account for about 20% of the organized groups. The second type is labor-equivalent, soldier-to-soldier, general-to-general labor exchange mutual aid. For example, the Wang Xianglin group in Xishu Village, Shexian County, has eight households and eight laborers, and seven livestock. The labor intensity is very high. They use a labor-for-labor system. Weak laborers cannot withstand it. The third type is a mutual aid group that combines labor and livestock mutual aid and labor exchange. For example, the Zhang He group in Xishu Village has five households. Zhang He is old, but has livestock. His son-in-law has one laborer and one donkey. There is also a single man with labor but no livestock, an old widow with neither labor nor livestock, and a young man with labor but no livestock. The entire group has one pair of livestock, three laborers, and farms more than 50 mu of land. They implement labor and livestock exchange. The single man repays the labor owed by the old widow, and the old widow does needlework for the single man. Although they do not keep accounts, everyone consciously repays the owed labor, and the mutual aid is very good. The fourth type is a mutual aid group that combines to use larger production tools. For example, in Baitacun Village, Shahe County, many mutual aid groups use waterwheels to irrigate land together, based on the fact that some provide wheels, some provide waterwheels, and some provide livestock or labor. They come together for production, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, and feel extremely convenient, and gradually develop into mutual aid for other tasks. The fifth type is a larger-scale mutual aid for certain tasks. For example, in Heicheng Village, Lincheng County, when combating drought and replanting, Communist Party member Li Qingfu took the lead in leading the masses to voluntarily organize 96 people for mutual aid. They pushed carts from a relatively long distance to pull waterwheels to plant cotton, and replanted 60 mu in two days. After completing the replanting, they disbanded. The sixth type is a mutual aid group with kinship and social mutual assistance characteristics. For example, the Li Jinyi group in Xishu Village has three households. Only he has full labor and two livestock, taking care of his mother-in-law's and wife's sister's families who have no labor or livestock. It seems very unequal, but he voluntarily assumes his care obligations. This kind of mutual aid enables the two households without labor to sow, hoe, and harvest on time. In short, there are many organizations for mutual aid this year. Their characteristics are that some have many people, some have few people, some have group leaders, and some do not, and some have longer time periods, while others are very short. Experience has proved that only the diversity of mutual aid forms can attract more people to participate in the mutual aid movement, and can also widely exert the power of mutual aid. The strength is also extremely obvious in the development of agricultural production. Conversely, stereotyped mutual aid limited to one form is not feasible.

III. Experience in leading the masses in mutual aid. How should we further lead this widespread, spontaneous, and diverse mutual aid among the masses? In terms of concepts, we should recognize that such diverse mutual aid among the masses is completely suitable for the current agricultural development technology conditions, and there is no other way. Some comrades are dissatisfied with the current state of mutual aid among the masses, and yearn for ideal mutual aid, which does not help reality, which is wrong. Some comrades blindly worship the spontaneity of mutual aid among the masses and let it run its course without further strengthening the leadership of the Party, which is also wrong. How should we lead the spontaneous mutual aid among the masses? First, we should analyze the characteristics of spontaneous mutual aid. What are those characteristics? A. Although there are many forms of spontaneous mutual aid among the masses, there are one or two core figures in each mutual aid group to maintain it. B. These core figures are particularly fond of labor and enthusiastic about technological improvements. C. Each member of the mutual aid group likes to be rewarded by the government for production, because the reward not only brings honor, but also believes that their actions are completely in line with the government's policies, encouraging them to be bolder in production. D. Each member generally has a kind of conservatism in improving production technology, which is a characteristic of small producers. Therefore, the experience of leading mutual aid is: First, we must use the exemplary actions of Communist Party members to set an example in production in the mutual aid they directly participate in, to influence the general public. For example, when applying topdressing fertilizer in Dongguan, Heshun County, in addition to the general call, each party member applied topdressing fertilizer first, and the crops immediately appeared different, and then they promoted and persuaded everyone in the group to apply topdressing fertilizer, and popularized it throughout the village, breaking the farmers' conservative concepts. Second, unite the core figures of various types in the mutual aid group around the branch, and contact the broad masses through them. The form of unity should be carried out through irregular production activist conferences. For example, in Xiguan, Zuoquan County, the effect was great when applying topdressing fertilizer in the summer through this form. Third, unite this group of core figures by improving technology and exchanging experiences, because these people like to talk about production technology, and they are happy to participate in this kind of meeting as long as it is conducive to the development of production. For example, Zuoquan Zhangbacun Village held a forum for experienced old farmers on topdressing fertilizer technology. In addition to introducing the benefits of topdressing fertilizer, experienced people also introduced methods such as applying compost fertilizer. Fourth, be good at organizing agricultural production competitions, promoting production movements, and realizing the Party's call. Methods for organizing competitions: (1) According to the situation in the village, stipulate specific standards, such as those who hoe the seedlings more than three times are model workers, those who apply topdressing fertilizer more than a certain percentage of cultivated land, and those who apply more than a certain amount per mu are model workers, and avoid many conditions. (2) Depending on the segment of the task, summarize and evaluate once, and do not drag it out for too long. For example, after applying topdressing fertilizer, give awards once, and after accumulating green manure, give awards once. (3) In addition to daily broadcasts, the reward method at the end of a period should be to issue a certificate of merit to each model worker as a permanent memento. (4) The more model workers, the better. Don't be afraid that this time is a model, and the next time it is not a model. We should recognize its variability. Summarize again after a season or a year, and according to the number of awards they have won as the standard. In this way, we encourage the masses to make multiple models on each call. Each time after an award is given, summarize each segment of production. The village government should be responsible for this organizational work.

    太行农业互助领导经验
    太行全区上半年农业互助情况及领导经验是这样的：
    一、组织起来的规模是广泛的。农业领域中，互助合作运动在太行区素有基础，本年度组织起来规模较往年大为广泛，如壶关去年五月份四十六个村统计，真正卷入互助运动中的农户占总户数的百分之二十五点七。今年卷入互助运动中的农户，据平顺、长治、陵川、邢台、赞皇、内邱、涉县四百八十二个村统计共七万九千户，真正参加互助的农户则达四万九千七百七十户，平均占总户百分之六十三。又据壶关、黎城、邢台、长治、昔阳六个村统计，卷入互助运动的农户占总户数百分之卅一点七，邢台一百五十个村的统计，在夏收中组织起来的规模更大，占总户数百分之八十一点七。广泛组织起来的结果，对提高农业生产力起了极大的作用，如壶关十里村，除作到精耕细作外，互助起来赶出工开荒一百二十亩，扩大了耕地面积。农业领域中，组织起来发展生产的号召，在太行区已真正成为群众性的运动了。农业互助合作运动能够广泛发展的原因有二：（一）土改后生产手段趋于分散，为了发展生产，农民在客观上迫切要求组织起来，如八个县十三个村调查，共九千三百七十六户，土地三万一千七百六十二亩，其中劳畜力俱全的户占百分之四十二点七，有劳力无畜力户占百分之三十一点八五，有畜力无劳力户占百分之五点二五，劳畜力俱无的户占百分之二十点二。由此看出若不靠组织起来，要想顺利完成增产一成的任务，显然是不可能的。正如武乡难峪群众反映：不要怕不互助（指干部说），现在人手宽便的户太多了，不互助就不能干活。（二）严格纠正了以往组织起来政策上的各种变相强迫，认真贯彻了只要有利于发展生产，为群众真正喜爱自愿的互助形式，不拘大小等一概加以赞助。总之前半年组织起来所以能够如此广泛的发展，最基本的原因是在于群众对组织起来的客观要求和正确的执行了组织起来政策相结合的结果。
    二、组织起来的形式是多种多样的。由于组织形式是多种多样的，参加的成员也是众多的，所以生产力也是宏大的。现就其组织形式略举几种如下：第一种，在共产党员或劳动英雄为核心的领导下，长年不曾垮过的互助组，如和顺合山村共产党员又是劳动英雄赵富魁领导下的互助组，共五户，劳力五个，六个牛，三个驴，土地八十余亩，都是翻身户，其中有一个石匠、一个木匠、一个种过菜园很懂技术的老汉，从一九四二年组织起来生产，直到现在没有分散过，使每个成员感到互助有三大好处：（１）劳力使用合理化，如全组随季节有统一耕作计划和统一调拨劳力的办法，如抽出一人长年赶牲口搞运输，供给全组烧煤等，各方面生产感到了方便。（２）该组有精通农业技术的一个老汉作顾问，对每个成员在改进技术发展生产上得益很大。（３）全组公道又涵厚，使用工票计工，一季结算一次，秋后以实物清理长欠。这类互助在老区还不少，据调查约占已组织起来的百分之二十的样子。第二种劳力相等，兵对兵、将对将的变工互助。如涉县西戍村王相林组，八户八个劳力，并有七个牲口，劳力强度很高，采用工换工的制度，劳力弱的进去就顶不住。第三种劳畜力互助变工结合在一起的互助组，如西戍村张何组五户，张何年迈，但有牲口，其女婿有一劳力，一头毛驴，还有一单身汉有劳力没牲口，有一老寡妇劳畜力俱无，有一青年有劳力没畜力，全组一犋牲口，三个劳力，种地五十余亩，实行劳畜力互换，老寡妇欠的工由单身汉还，老寡妇给单身汉作针线，虽不记帐但每人都自觉的还欠工，互助的很好。第四种，以使用较大的生产工具结合起来的互助组，如沙河白塔村有不少互助组伙使水车浇地，就是基于：有的出车轮，有的户出水车，有的户出畜力或出劳力，碰到一块生产，取长补短，感到极大方便，并逐渐发展到其他活计的互助。第五种，一定活计上的较大型的互助，如临城黑城村，在抗旱补种时，党员李庆付带头领导群众自愿组织起九十六人互助，从较远的地方推大车拉水车点种棉花，两天就补种六十亩，完成补种后就分解了。第六种，亲友关系带有社会互济性的互助组，如西戍村李金义组三户，只有他一个全劳动，两个牲口，照管他的无劳畜力的岳母家、妻妹家，看去很不等价，但他自愿承担其照顾的义务。这种互助使两家没劳力的户都能按时下种、锄刨、收割。总之今年互助的组织很多，其特点有的人多，有的人少，有的有组长，有的没有，时间有的较长，有的则很短。经验证明，只有互助形式的多样性，才能吸引更多的群众卷入互助运动，亦才能广泛的发挥互助的力量，在发展农业生产上，就表现出力量也极为明显。反之刻版式的拘于一种形式的互助是行不通的。
    三、领导群众互助的经验。对群众中这种广泛自发的多种多样的互助，应该如何去进一步领导呢？观念上应该承认群众中这样多种多样的互助是完全适合当前农业发展技术条件的，舍此别无他途。有些同志不满群众中当前的互助现状，追慕理想中的互助，结果无补于现实，这是不对的。有些同志盲目的崇拜群众中互助的自发性任其自流，不进一步去加强党的领导，这也是不对的。究竟应如何领导群众中自发着的互助呢？先应分析自发互助的特点。有那些特点呢？甲、群众自发着的互助形式虽很多，但每个互助组中均有一、二核心人物作维系。乙、这种核心人物是特别喜爱劳动及热心技术改进。丙、互助组的每个成员，都喜爱在生产上受到政府的奖励，因为奖励不但获得了荣誉，且认为自己的行动与政府的政策是完全符合的，鼓励了他们更大胆的生产。丁、每个成员在改进生产技术上，一般都有一种并且是保守的，这是小生产者的特点。为此领导互助的经验有：第一、要以共产党员的模范行动，在直接参加的互助中，在生产上作出榜样，以影响一般。如和顺东关党员在上追肥时，除了一般号召外，每个党员先上了追肥，庄稼立刻显得颜色不一样了，然后推动说服本组人都上了追肥，并普及了全村，打破了农民的守旧观念。第二、团结互助组中各色各样的核心人物在支部周围，经过他们去联系广大群众，团结的形式应透过不定期的生产活动分子大会去进行。如左权西关，在夏季上追肥，即透过这种形式作用很大。第三、用改进技术、交流经验，来团结这批核心人物，因为这些人是喜爱谈生产技术的，只要对发展生产有利，他们是乐于参加这种会的。如左权丈八村召开上追肥技术老农座谈会，有经验的人除介绍上追肥的好处外，并介绍了上圊肥等方法。第四、善于组织农业生产竞赛，推动生产运动，实现党的号召。组织竞赛的办法：（１）根据村里情况，规定具体标准，如锄苗超过三遍的即为模范，上追肥超过占耕地多少，每亩上至多少担者即为模范，切忌条件繁多。（２）随活计的段落性，即可总结评选一次，不要拖的过长，如上罢追肥，即发奖一次，积罢绿肥发奖一次。（３）奖励办法除每日的广播外，告一段落时的发奖，要发给每一个模范者以奖状作为永久纪念。（４）模范者要愈多愈好，不要怕这次模范，下次不模范，应该承认其可变性，到一季或到一年时，和按其得奖的次数多寡为标准再总结一下，如此鼓励群众在每件号召上作多次的模范，每经过一次评奖，即对每一段落生产作一总结，村政府应该担负这个组织工作。
