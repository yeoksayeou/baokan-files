　　Fourth Trolley Line Suspended; Replaced by Buses

　　[This Newspaper's Report] The Ping City Tram Company, citing overcrowded trams on all lines, causing excessive vehicle damage and hindering on-time arrivals, has accepted requests from various parties to concentrate the use of its vehicles. Starting tomorrow (the 20th), the Fourth Route (Beixinqiao to Pinganli) will be temporarily suspended, and the vehicles from that line will be added to other main lines. The original route will be served by buses operated by the company, with the same fares and stops as the trams.
