Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th -- The heinous crime of the Kuomintang bandit gang plotting to recruit Japanese troops to China to slaughter compatriots has aroused angry protests from educational circles in Kunming. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Kunming on the 28th, teachers and staff from public and private universities, middle schools, and primary schools in Kunming held a meeting at Victory Hall on the afternoon of the 27th to celebrate Teachers' Day. The conference resolved to send a telegram to the entire nation, opposing Japanese troops coming to China to assist in the war. The telegram stated: "Wu Tiecheng's trip to Japan is under orders to beg for assistance." The telegram also called for the elimination of secret agent elements and opposition to illegal persecution, which was in response to recent widespread rumors that the Jiang, Li, and Bai bandit gangs would implement a reign of terror of secret agents in Kunming. In the evening, a variety show was held, with performances including "Yangko" and "Before Dawn," expressing that the people of Kunming are eagerly awaiting liberation.
