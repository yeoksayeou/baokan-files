    [This City News] Mr. Du of Gaoshi, resident of No. 29, Xiaopaifang Hutong, First District of this city, donated 1,419 volumes of Song, Ming, and Qing dynasty versions of books and other books, 502 volumes of rubbings from stone inscriptions, and 29 pages of rubbings to the Zhongshan Park Branch of the Peiping Municipal Library, and hired cart-pullers to deliver them on June 29th. Mr. Du once studied at Chaoyang University. His family possessed books and rubbings from stone inscriptions purchased by his ancestors. Because he himself did not study Sinology, allowing them to sit idle was meaningless. Also, because his home was small and the storage conditions were poor, they were easily damaged. Therefore, with the consent of his family and the Municipal Library, he donated the books to the library for long-term preservation and public access. The People's Government believes that Mr. Du's action is intended to support social education and embodies the spirit of serving the people, and has decided to issue a written commendation to him.

    高师杜捐书两千册
    政府将予书面褒扬
    【本市讯】本市第一区小牌坊胡同二十九号居民高师杜先生将其家藏的宋、明、清版本书籍，及其他书籍一四一九册，碑帖五○二册，拓片二十九页，捐赠北平市立图书馆中山公园分馆，并于六月二十九日自雇排子车送去。高先生曾在朝阳大学读书，家中存有先人购置的书籍碑帖，因其本人不是研究国学的，任其闲置，殊无意义，又因其家中房屋狭窄，存放不好，易致毁损，故征得其家长与市立图书馆之同意，将该项书籍捐赠该馆，以便长期保存，公诸社会。人民政府认为高先生此种举动意在赞助社教，是为人民服务的精神，特决定予以书面褒扬。
