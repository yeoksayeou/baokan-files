    (Nanjing People's Broadcasting Station, 12th) The Second Field Army Headquarters and Political Department held a cadre evening party for two consecutive days, August 8th and 9th, to welcome over one thousand students from the North China People's Revolutionary University who had come south to participate in the work of the Second Field Army. Zhang Jichun, Deputy Political Commissar of the Second Field Army, and Li Da, Chief of Staff, pointed out at the meeting that the students' active participation in the People's Army was a glorious contribution to the motherland. Intellectual youths should transform themselves in actual struggle, humbly learn the strong will and labor concepts of the soldiers, and overcome the wavering and other weaknesses of the petty bourgeoisie.
