    Small Announcement
    Currently, all organizations and schools are studying "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." We hope that everyone will send us the most debated questions and study心得 (xīndé; insights gained) during the study. We plan to select some of them for publication and discussion, in order to exchange learning experiences. We especially hope that comrades from Party training classes, summer study groups, and summer schools will contribute more articles.

    目前，各机关各学校都在学习“论人民民主专政”，希望大家将学习中争论最多的问题和学习心得寄给我们，我们准备挑选其中一部分发表，进行讨论，借以交流学习经验。特别希望党训班、暑期学习团以及暑期学园的同志们多多来稿。
