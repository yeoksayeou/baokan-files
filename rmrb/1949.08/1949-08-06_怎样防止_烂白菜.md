    How to Prevent "Rotten Cabbage"
    Autumn has arrived, and it is time to plant cabbage. In the past, our cabbage often rotted, causing significant losses, sometimes even complete failure with no harvest. Rotten cabbage is a bacterial disease transmitted through the soil, so prevention is crucial. Here are some preventive measures:
    1. Seed Selection: According to experiments at Quyang Farm, the Tangxian Small Woxin and Quyang Daqingbang varieties have the strongest disease resistance. These two varieties can be selected for planting in various regions.
    2. Site Selection: Choose land that has not been planted with cabbage before or has not been affected by rotten cabbage disease. Land that has previously experienced rotten cabbage disease should not be replanted for three years. Also, avoid planting radishes, turnips, potatoes, or tobacco, as these crops are susceptible to similar diseases as cabbage and can also become infected.
    3. Soil Disinfection: Before planting cabbage, apply slaked lime (preferably crushed lumps of unslaked lime; powdered lime is acceptable if lumps are unavailable) at a rate of 15 jin per fen (unit of area), spreading it evenly over the ground. When tilling the land, turn the lime into the soil (however, do not apply lime to alkaline soil).
    4. Late Planting: Cabbage planted too early, when the weather is hot, tends to rot more. Delay planting by a few days as much as possible without affecting yield.
    5. Pay Attention to Drainage: Avoid overwatering to prevent the soil from becoming damp and shady. After watering, hoe the soil to keep the surface dry. Additionally, if there is excessive rainfall and water accumulates in the cabbage ridges, drain the water away.
    6. Remove Rotten Cabbage: If rotten cabbage is found in the cabbage patch, it should be removed and buried deep in the ground or burned, not discarded randomly on the ground. Apply some lime to the pit where the rotten cabbage was removed to kill any remaining bacteria in the soil and prevent further spread.

    怎样防止“烂白菜”
    立秋已到，正是种白菜的时候，咱们种的白菜，过去常发现有烂的现象，使白菜受到很大的损失，厉害的有完全烂完，毫无收成。烂白菜是一种土壤传染的细菌病，应着重防预，现把几种预防的方法介绍如下：
    一、选种：据曲阳农场试验，选抗病力最强的是唐县小窝心及曲阳大青帮。各地可选种这两种白菜。
    二、选地，种白菜要选择没种过白菜或没害过烂白菜病的地种，已发生过烂白菜病的地，要隔三年才能再种，也不要种罗卜、蔓菁、山药蛋或烟叶等，因为这些菜蔬与白菜害的病差不多，也能染上。
    三、土壤消毒，种白菜前每分地用石灰（最好是用没有粉开的块灰碾碎，如果没有块灰，粉开的也行）市秤十五斤，匀撒到地面，耕地时将石灰翻到地里（但是出硷的地不能施石灰）。
    四、晚种，白菜一般种的早了，天气热，烂的多，尽可能在不影响产量下迟种几天。
    五、注意排水，浇水时不要浇的过多，使地阴湿，浇水后可以将地锄一次，使地面干爽。另外，如果下雨太多，菜畦内有水，应将水放去。
    六、拔去烂白菜，在白菜畦发现有烂的应当拔去，深埋在地下或烧掉，不要乱扔在地里。并将拔去的坑里放些石灰，杀死残存在土地里的病菌，以免传染。
