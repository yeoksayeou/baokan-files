    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th. TASS reports: Moscow newspapers on the 5th prominently featured Greek war news in their international sections, reporting on the Royalist Fascist army's offensive against the Grammos mountain region in northern Greece and the staunch counterattacks of the Greek Democratic Army.
    "Labor News" published a special feature by Bas, a reporter for the French "Workers' Observer," who visited the Greek liberated areas, including the Grammos mountain region, with a delegation of French democrats. Bas faithfully described the high morale of the Democratic Army—the liberators and defenders of the Grammos mountain region.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th. Sofia Radio broadcast on the 2nd: The Executive Committee of the Greek Democratic Women's Federation issued a letter to all Greek women and women worldwide, stating: "Tragic news is coming from the enslaved regions of Greece. A severe earthquake recently struck Chios Island, where 2,500 democratic women are imprisoned in concentration camps, causing immense damage. They are in danger of being buried under the ruins of the prison. They all have children, many of whom are infants. They have experienced the 'benevolence' of American 'aid' to Greece. The executioners in Athens, disregarding the fate of these women and children, even refuse to move them to a safe place." The letter continued: "At the same time, the Royalist Fascist military courts are handing down new death sentences every day. Women warriors fighting for Greek freedom and independence, because they disobey the Royalist Fascists and refuse to be slaves, and who are nurturing heroes against the Royalist Fascists for the Democratic Army, are increasingly being subjected to court trials. But we cannot abandon our heroines. We will rise up together to defend them, and we demand the rescue of the women imprisoned on Chios Island and their transfer to a safe place." The letter appealed to democratic women worldwide to do everything possible to support the calls of Greek patriotic women.

    希民主军士气旺盛
    坚强反击保皇法西斯军
    妇联呼吁援救被囚民主妇女
    【新华社北平七日电】塔斯社报道：五日莫斯科各报国际栏以显著地位刊载希腊战讯，报道保皇法西斯军对希腊北部格拉姆斯山区的进攻以及希民主军的顽强反击。
    劳动报刊载法国“工人观察报”记者巴斯的特写，巴斯曾随法国民主人士代表团访问希腊解放区，包括格拉姆斯山区在内。巴斯忠实地叙述了民主军——格拉姆斯山区的解放者和保卫者——的旺盛士气。
    【新华社北平七日电】索非亚电台二日广播：希腊民主妇联执委会发表告希腊全体妇女及全世界妇女书，内称：希腊被奴役的地区正传来可悲的消息。有二千五百名民主妇女被囚禁在集中营里的开俄斯岛最近发生强烈地震，引起巨大损害。她们有着可能被埋葬在监狱的废墟下的危险。她们都有孩子，有许多还是襁褓中的婴儿。她们体验到了美国对希“援助”的恩惠。雅典的刽子手毫不顾及这些妇女和小孩的命运，甚至拒绝把她们转移到安全的地方。该书继称：同时，保皇法西斯军事法庭每天都有新的死刑判决。争取希腊自由与独立的女战士，因为不服从保皇法西斯和不愿作奴隶，为民主军培养着反对保皇法西斯的英雄，所以愈来愈经常地受到法庭的审讯。但是我们不能舍弃我们的女英雄。我们将全体起而保卫她们，我们要求援救开俄斯岛被囚禁的妇女并把她们转移到安全的地方去。该书吁请全世界民主妇女竭尽所能来声援希腊爱国妇女的呼声。
