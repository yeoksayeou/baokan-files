Our Dear Moscow
Translated from the Soviet Literature Gazette, February 5, 1949

Moscow – the capital of our great motherland, the capital of the world's first worker-peasant socialist state. Comrade Stalin calls her the standard-bearer of the new Soviet era. All Soviet people look to her – dear Moscow. All our victories are inseparable from her name, her great image encourages our achievements in heroic undertakings, inspiring us to fight for the victory of our communist ideals.

Moscow – is the largest industrial center in our country. The factories and workshops of the capital account for more than one-fifth of the total industrial output of our country. Moscow is the country's creative laboratory, where the experience of socialist construction is accumulated; she spreads this experience throughout the country as a model for all enterprises. Thousands of specialists graduate from universities and specialized schools every year, proud to have the glorious title of graduates of Moscow higher education institutions. The nursery of advanced socialist culture – Moscow, her broad intelligentsia, her countless ranks of scientific, literary, and artistic activists, all contribute the finest people's wisdom and genius to the motherland, opening up new paths for our advanced material science, socialist realism in art and literature.

The Moscow Party organization is the greatest and most advanced Party organization of our Party. She is a solid pillar of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee led by Stalin, and she often walks at the forefront of the warriors for the realization of Lenin and Stalin's ideals. In the cause of post-war construction, she occupies a position befitting her status – the vanguard of the working people of the capital, the creators of new plans, the explorers of shortcuts to communism.

The Bolsheviks of Moscow embody the best qualities of the warriors of the Lenin-Stalin Party. Unlimited loyalty to the cause of communism, love for their motherland, a Bolshevik sense of revolutionary responsibility, inspiring labor, tireless creation and invention, enthusiasm for fighting for the victory of all innovation and progress – these qualities permeate the life, labor and activities of the Bolsheviks in the capital.

They have also demonstrated special strength in leading the industry of Moscow and the Moscow region. The working people of the capital once proposed to reach the industrial production level of the final year of the Five-Year Plan in three and a half years, but they completed the Five-Year Plan in the first three years.

Moscow industry has become a model for opening up new paths for the upsurge of labor productivity, showing the country an example of outstanding, creative socialist economy. Last year, the people of Moscow were pioneers in the national patriotic movement in terms of saving expenses, raw materials, fuel, electricity, materials, etc. Thanks to the national savings of 600 billion rubles, including Moscow's savings of 200 billion, our motherland, led by the Moscow Bolsheviks, was able to accelerate the completion of the post-war Five-Year Plan. Recently, we have seen new patriotic initiatives from the people of Moscow - they declared that they would extract 60 billion rubles from the circulating funds of enterprises by improving production technology and accelerating the production process. The call put forward by the people of Moscow that every ruble should produce more products has been warmly responded to by the working class across the country.

Moscow is changing at an astonishing speed before our eyes. The more magnificent and outstanding the capital of our motherland becomes, the more it presents an example for the capitals of other countries in the world of workers building a new life.

Which city, which capital of any country can compare with Moscow in terms of construction scale, in terms of the achievements of vast undertakings! Only Soviet socialist Moscow, thanks to the support of the whole country, thanks to the superiority of our socialist system, thanks to the special care and assistance of the Party and the Soviet government, and thanks to the constant concern of the great Stalin, can build the best subway in the world, can excavate the largest canal, and make our capital a port of three seas, increasing the residential area by one and a half times compared to before the October Revolution, building thousands of gas-fitted houses, and creating thousands of public buildings – theaters, universities, hospitals, clubs and cultural palaces, libraries, and primary and secondary schools.

The Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) called for the necessity to formulate a new and huge plan for rebuilding Moscow in twenty to twenty-five years. This new Stalinist concern for our capital's wise instructions has inspired the people of Moscow to even more selfless labor enthusiasm. Based on scientifically formulated plans, with the help of the whole country, the people of Moscow will transform our capital into the most beautiful communist city, raising high the banner of the new communist era.

As the capital and the largest industrial and cultural center in the country, Moscow's good influence spreads everywhere, to the most remote corners of our motherland. This influence is also powerfully manifested in the speed of cultural and economic upsurge of the collective farms in the Moscow region. Eliminating the opposition between town and country on a truly Bolshevik scale, the Moscow region is smoothly realizing rural electrification, widely developing radio, and constructing cultural institutions on a large scale.

Moscow – is a source of creative inspiration, her image often stirs the hearts of artists and poets. Moscow – the center and foundation of the Russian nation – Pushkin and Lermontov praised her, Glinka and Mussorgsky, Surikov and Vasnetsov, Gogol and Tolstoy, Ostrovsky and Chekhov were all inspired by her.

Our Soviet writers, poets, and playwrights describe Moscow and her heroic people; architects and sculptors embellish her, and her current appearance is also being captured on film. However, the great image of Soviet Moscow – the center of world culture and advanced revolutionary thought – is still waiting for the most outstanding artistic depictions. About her, dear and lovable Moscow, immortal, highly ideological works must be created. The images of the outstanding figures of our capital should be vividly portrayed in novels and poems, plays and movies, on artists' canvases and sculptors' bronze and marble.

The light of the ruby stars on the Kremlin shines on all corners of the earth; the call of Moscow Radio happily excites the hearts of millions of people all over the world.

    我们亲爱的莫斯科
    译自一九四九年二月五日苏联文学报
    莫斯科——是我们伟大祖国的首都，是世界上第一个工农社会主义国家的首都。斯大林同志称她为新的苏维埃年代的旗手。全体苏维埃人民都注视着她——亲爱的莫斯科。所有我们的胜利都和她的名字分不开，她的伟大的形象鼓励我们在英雄事业上的成就，鼓舞我们为我们共产主义理想的胜利而奋斗。
    莫斯科——是我国最大的工业中心。首都的工厂作坊占我国整个工业生产总收入的五分之一以上。莫斯科是国家的创造实验室，那里积聚着社会主义建设的经验；她把这些经验传播到全国各地，作为一切企业的楷模。大学校和专门学校每年有好几千专门家毕业，他们骄傲自己有莫斯科高等学校毕业生的光荣名衔。先进的社会主义文化的苗圃——莫斯科，她的宽广的知识分子阶层，她的无数科学、文学、艺术活动者的队伍，都贡献给祖国最优秀的人民知慧和天才的创作，向我们先进的，物质科学，社会主义现实主义的艺术和文学开拓新的道路。
    莫斯科党的组织—是我们党最伟大的先进的党的组织。她是联邦共产党（布）斯大林中央委员会巩固的支柱，她常常走在为实现列宁斯大林理想的战士们的前头。在战后建设事业里她据有适合于她的地位——首都劳动人民战斗先锋队的地位，新计划创造者的地位，走向共产主义的捷径的探索者的地位。
    莫斯科的布尔塞维克们在自己身上表现了列宁斯大林党的战士们的最好的特色。对共产主义事业无限的忠诚，热爱自己的祖国。布尔塞维克式的革命责任感，鼓舞劳动，不倦地创造发明，为一切革新和进步的胜利而奋斗的热忱——这些品质浸注在首都布尔塞维克们的生活、劳动和活动中。
    他们在领导莫斯科和莫斯科州的工业上也表现了特殊的力量。首都的劳动人民曾提出了要在三年半中达到五年计划最后一年的工业生产水平，但他们在头三年中就完成了五年计划了。
    莫斯科工业成为向劳动生产的高涨开辟新道路的楷模，向全国显示出卓越的，创造性的社会主义经济的范例。在去年，莫斯科人民在全国爱国运动里，是节省开支、原料、燃料电力、材料、等等方面的先导者。由于全国节约了六十万万卢布，连莫斯科节约的二万万在内，我们祖国得以由莫斯科布尔塞维克率领而加速完成战后五年计划。最近我们又见到莫斯科人们新的爱国创举—他们声言要用改良生产技术，加速生产过程的办法而从企业周转资金中抽出六千万万卢布来。为莫斯科人所提出的声言每一个卢布要得出更多的生产品的号召，得到了全国工人阶级热烈的响应。
    莫斯科的面前，在我们眼前以惊人的速度改变着。我们祖国的首都变得愈壮丽愈卓越，就愈给世界各国首都呈现出劳动者建设新生活的榜样。
    有哪一个城市，有哪一国的首都能在建设规模方面，能在浩大的事业成就方面和莫斯科相比呢！只有苏维埃社会主义的莫斯科，由于有全国的支援，由于我国社会主义制度的优越性，由于党和苏维埃政府的特别关怀和帮助，由于伟大斯大林的经常关心，才能建设起世界上最好的地下铁道，才能凿成最大的运河，并使我们首都成为三大海的港口，较十月革命前增加了一倍半的住宅面积，建筑起几千间有瓦斯装置的房屋，造成了几千幢公共建筑——戏院、大学校、医院、俱乐部和文化宫、图书馆和中小学校。
    苏联部长会议和联共（布）中央委员会号召有必要拟制在二十年到二十五年间重建莫斯科的新的巨大的计划。这一新的斯大林式的关怀我们首都的英明指示，鼓舞起了莫斯科人民更忘我的劳动热忱。根据科学地拟订计划，借全国的助力，莫斯科人民将把我们的首都改变成最最漂亮的共产主义的城市，高高地悬起新的共产主义年代的旗帜。
    作为首都和全国最大的工业和文化中心的莫斯科，她的良好影响传到了各地，传到了我们祖国最遥远的角落。这种影响也有力地表现在莫斯科州集体农庄的文化经济高涨的速度上。以真正布尔塞维克的规模消除城乡的对立，莫斯科州正顺利地实现着农村电气化，广泛发展无线电，大量建设文化机关。
    莫斯科——是创作灵感的源泉，她的形象常常激动艺术家和诗人们的心灵。莫斯科——俄罗斯民族国家的中心和基础——普希庚和莱蒙托夫歌颂过她，格里金和摩索尔格斯基，苏里可夫和万斯涅佐夫，果戈里和托尔斯泰，奥斯特洛夫斯基和契诃夫都被她引起了创作的灵感。
    我们苏维埃的作家、诗人、戏剧家描写着莫斯科及其英勇的人们；建筑家和雕塑家加意修饰她，她今天的面貌也正摄制到影片上去。但是，苏维埃莫斯科的伟大形象——世界文化和先进革命思想的中心，还等待着最最出色的艺术的描绘。关于她，可亲可爱的莫斯科，必须创作出不朽的，有高度思想性的作品来。我们首都的卓越人物的形象，应该鲜明地刻划在小说和诗歌，剧本和电影里，艺术家的画板和雕塑家的青铜及大理石上。
    克里姆林宫上，红宝石星的光芒，照射到地球上的所有角落；莫斯科无线电的呼唤，愉快地激动着全世界千百万人们的心灵。
    ×          ×        ×
     全苏联人民都
     爱戴你，
     全苏维埃国家
     为你而骄傲，—
     你给我们带来
     了欢欣，
     你是共和国的
     城垣，劳动国家
     最美丽的首都！
    ×          ×        ×
     为了你火样的
     星更加灿烂，莫
     斯科，光荣事业
     的见证人，
     壮大起来吧！
     我们怎能不爱
     你，怎能不保卫
     你，
     伟大的城市，
     有我们的斯大林
     住在这里。
                  （叶黎译）
