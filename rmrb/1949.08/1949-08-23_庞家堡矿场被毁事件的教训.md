　　Lessons from the Destruction of the Pangjiabao Mine
　　Editor's Note: For detailed information on the destruction of the Pangjiabao Mine, please refer to the report "Destruction of Pangjiabao Mine Stopped, Lessons Worth Remembering in Various Regions" by our reporter Li Yi stationed in Xuanhua, published on page two of this newspaper on August 16th. Please pay attention.
　　The Pangjiabao Mine of the Xuanhua Longyan Iron Mine suffered severe damage. Important equipment of the mine, such as huge electric motors, triangular iron frames, and high-voltage lines, were dismantled and sold by unscrupulous elements, so that the mine, already damaged by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits, suffered further destruction. It is unknown how much more time, manpower, and resources it will take to restore it. What is particularly serious is that this destruction occurred after liberation, under the rule of the People's Government, and continued for more than ten months. Not only were the destructive elements not punished, but they were encouraged and condoned. Even individual Communist Party members and government workers themselves participated in this criminal act of stealing and destroying state property. What a shocking and serious event!
　　Why was the Pangjiabao Mine so badly damaged? What lessons can we learn from this event?
　　First, this incident shows that some of our Communist Party members, government cadres, and a portion of the backward masses lack the concept of cherishing state property, do not recognize the importance of industrial equipment and industrial construction, and do not have the grand vision and overall concept of building a new industrialized China. On the contrary, deep-rooted reactionary agrarian socialist ideas and selfish individualism and departmentalism exist. Therefore, in order to greedily pursue their own selfish interests, to "engage in production and marketing" for their own units, to "get some steel from the mine to exchange for food," to pity a few profiteers and impoverished residents, and for thousands of other such "reasons," they can disregard government prohibitions, condone and shield destructive elements, and even personally dismantle machines, destroy industrial and mining equipment, and divide up state property, causing serious damage to the industrial construction of the people's motherland. It is evident that the reactionary idea of placing the narrow and temporary interests of individuals and small units above the overall and long-term interests of the state and the people has become a major enemy of social development. Although, in the twenty-eight years since the founding of the Communist Party of China, especially since the People's Liberation Army launched its major offensive, we have repeatedly emphasized the establishment of the concept of overall and long-term interests, cherishing state property, and building a new industrialized China, the destruction of the Pangjiabao Mine and other similar events tell us that this ideology has not yet been truly promoted to every corner, imprinted in the minds of all Communist Party members and working cadres, and awakened their consciousness, so as to educate and mobilize the broad masses to jointly seek its realization. The Chahar South CPC Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office said in their self-criticism that the Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office themselves had a rural construction viewpoint but lacked a clear industrial construction concept. They did not vigorously educate cadres and the masses to make them realize that the mining industry today belongs to the people themselves and should be cherished, but instead showed an indifferent attitude. Since the ideological understanding of the leading organs was so poor, it is no wonder that the subordinates would act recklessly. The experiences of the Soviet Union and China both prove that to implement a correct ideology and eliminate backward ideas is not something that can be accomplished in a day or two, or even three to five years, but requires long-term, arduous, and patient persuasive education work. It is necessary to conduct frequent and repeated education on the basic ideas of Marxism-Leninism among cadres, Communist Party members, and the broad masses, explaining that China can only eliminate backwardness, ignorance, and darkness and universally improve the material and cultural lives of the majority of the people by building a modern industry, and that to build industry, it is necessary to protect state property and accumulate state funds. It is necessary to seize many specific events and use each good and bad example to carry out commendation and criticism, rewards and punishments, so as to establish the noble idea that the interests of the state and the people are above all else, and to overcome selfish departmentalism and reactionary agrarian socialist concepts. It is necessary to create a public opinion among the masses that upholding the law, being faithful to one's duties, cherishing the motherland's property, and increasing the wealth of the state and individuals with sacred labor and wisdom, and enjoying the fruits one deserves, are the greatest glory and joy; while destroying the law and discipline, engaging in malfeasance, being passive and slack in work, stealing and wasting public property, and exploiting the property of the state and the people for personal gain are the most despicable and shameful behaviors, so that even those who are ideologically more backward cannot but behave themselves in the face of public opinion and dare not engage in blatant theft and waste.
　　Second, although our Communist Party and the People's Government leading organs and staff are generally honest and hardworking, serious bureaucratic work styles exist in some organizations. This bureaucracy corrodes our body and vitality and harms the interests and cause of the state. The Longyan Iron Mine Pangjiabao Mine was in a state of disaster of being stolen and destroyed for a full ten months. The CPC Chahar Provincial Committee and Chahar South Prefectural Committee, and the People's Government Chahar Provincial Government and Chahar South Commissioner's Office, were all close at hand. Did they hear nothing? However, according to reporter reports, the Chahar South CPC Prefectural Committee and Commissioner's Office did not convene a meeting specifically to review the issue of responsibility for the Pangjiabao destruction incident until July 29th and 30th. The Chahar People's Provincial Government seems to have paid attention to this matter earlier than the former. They ordered the Xuanhua and Longguan County Governments three times from March to June this year to stop the destruction; but this was limited to orders only, and they did not send anyone to conduct an on-the-spot inspection even once. The CPC Chahar Provincial Committee also did not carry out specific organizational work within the party to protect the mine. Is such an event related to important industrial and mining equipment, related to state property, and related to future industrial construction not worth attaching importance to? From this, it can be seen that some of our leading organs, because of the existence of bureaucratic ideological work styles, often lack foresight, do not carefully study the instructions of the higher authorities, and relax their concern for the overall cause; they are easily busy with daily trivial matters, and just happen to neglect important matters related to the fundamental interests of the state. When such things are reminded, they will also deal with them in a bad bureaucratic attitude, issuing one, two, or three orders, thinking that the order itself can solve everything; but they do not personally check, stipulate specific measures, and quickly stop them, sitting idly by as state property continues to suffer losses. Therefore, it is necessary to oppose bureaucracy, educate cadres and Party members to broaden their horizons, care about the overall cause of the Party and the state, understand the laws and prospects of revolutionary development, and promote a serious and responsible attitude and a practical and meticulous work style. Work should not be limited to ordering and arranging, but also requires in-depth inspection and supervision, and the result of each work that is actually started should be achieved. Otherwise, we will not be able to do any serious construction work well.
　　Third, it is necessary to establish and strengthen the protection and defense of factories, mines, forests, warehouses, etc. Such an important industrial and mining area as the Pangjiabao Mine should not have been without dedicated guards and armed guards from the beginning. In the industrial and mining enterprises in many cities that we have recovered and taken over, it is often found that some have been destroyed by the Kuomintang and are difficult to restore in the short term, but there are still many machines and equipment that have not been completely damaged, and they will be useful one day in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly dispatch engineers, technicians, or experts to conduct on-site inspections, register machine assets, assign dedicated guards, and equip them with armed protection. In addition to suppressing bandits and secret agents, one of the important tasks of the local military region's armed forces today should be to protect the state's industrial and mining, and forests. Even field troops, if stationed and resting in a place, should also pay attention to protecting the national enterprises in their vicinity. We must never abandon some industrial and mining enterprises that we do not have the power to restore for the time being, and allow the machines and materials in them to be stolen by unscrupulous elements or damaged by wind and rain, so that the state must pay much more capital and power to restore them in the future.
　　Today, the Chinese people are encountering economic difficulties. These difficulties are caused by the long-term rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, which have resulted in the backward state of China's industrial and agricultural economy; the blockade, bombing, and destruction by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries; natural disasters such as floods, droughts, wind, and hail; the increase in expenditures caused by war, the restoration of production and transportation, and the takeover of old institutions; and the fact that we lack the equipment and experience in construction work, which makes our economic recovery work unable to unfold quickly. But all these difficulties are difficulties in development, difficulties in the process of advancement. Every emerging revolutionary country has experienced such difficulties when it started to recover and rebuild, and will eventually overcome them. Thanks to the bravery and diligence of the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and with the help of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, we will surely be able to initially conquer these difficulties in three to five years, and organize the economic work into a clue. But for this reason, we must cherish state property, tighten our belts, work hard, and engage in construction. Many regions such as East China, Central China, and Northeast China are now vigorously streamlining and saving, and opposing corruption and waste, which is a concrete step to overcome difficulties. One of the purposes of streamlining and saving is to reduce expenditures, save funds, and improve work efficiency, so as to free up manpower and materials and put them into production and construction. But the facts prove that the biggest waste and the biggest damage to national wealth is not cherishing industrial and mining enterprises. Every accident that destroys industrial and mining forests and warehouses will cause great losses to the country, and it is unknown how many tens of thousands of people will have to tighten their belts for years to compensate for it. If we promote streamlining and saving on the one hand, and at the same time allow important state property to continue to be destroyed, is it not a great contradiction, and is it not a bit unfair to the hardworking frontline soldiers and the broad masses of working people? Therefore, we must educate our cadres, Party members, and the broad masses of people, and tell them about the backwardness and difficulties of China's economy; how imperialism and domestic reactionaries are engaging in economic sabotage, attempting to use our difficulties to force us to submit; and what a great responsibility we have undertaken in the construction cause. Chairman Mao said: "If we are ignorant in production work, cannot quickly learn production work, cannot restore and develop production as quickly as possible, and obtain definite achievements, first to improve the lives of the workers, and to improve the lives of the general public, then we will inevitably be unable to maintain political power, we will not be able to stand, we will fail." Of course, we do not want to fail, then we must first protect state property, and then make full use of these existing property to restore and develop production, manufacture and expand the state's property, and improve the people's lives.

### 庞家堡矿场被毁事件的教训

　　庞家堡矿场被毁事件的教训
    编者按：庞家堡矿场遭破坏的详细情况，见本报八月十六日二版刊载之本报驻宣化记者李翼报导“庞家堡矿场已制止破坏，经验教训值得各地记取”一文，请读者注意。
    宣化龙烟铁矿庞家堡矿场遭受严重破坏，矿场的重要设备，如巨大的电动机、三角铁架和高压线等，都被不良分子拆毁盗卖，以致已被日寇国民党匪帮所损毁的矿场，重受破坏，将来不知要多费多少时间，多少人力物力，才能恢复。而尤其严重的是这种破坏发生在重获解放以后，在人民政府统治之下，时间继续了十个月以上，破坏分子不但没有受到惩罚，反被鼓励纵容，甚至个别共产党员和政府工作人员自己也参加了这种盗窃和破坏国家财产的罪恶行为。这是何等令人惊心怵目的严重事件！
    庞家堡矿场为什么会被破坏得这样厉害？从这一事件中我们可以得到些什么教训呢？
    第一、这件事情说明，在我们某些共产党员、政府干部和一部分落后群众中，缺乏爱护国家财产的观念，不认识工业设备和工业建设的重要，没有建设工业化新中国的远大眼光和整体观念；反之，却存在着根深蒂固的反动的农业社会主义思想以及自私自利的个人主义和本位主义。因之，为了贪图一己私利，为了替本单位“搞生产、搞运销”，为了“从矿上弄点钢铁换点吃的”，为了怜惜几个奸商和贫苦居民，为了千百种诸如此类的“理由”，他们可以蔑视政府的禁令，纵容包庇破坏分子，甚至亲自动手拆毁机器，破坏工矿设备，瓜分国家财产，使得人民祖国的工业建设受到严重损害。可见，那种把个人和小单位狭隘的暂时利益看得比国家和人民的整体的长远利益重要的反动思想，已经成为社会发展的大敌。虽然，在中国共产党成立以来的二十八年时间中，特别是人民解放军大举进攻以来，我们曾一再强调树立整体和长远利益的观念，爱护国家财产，建设工业化的新中国；但是，庞家堡矿场的被毁和其他类似事件告诉我们，这种思想至今并未真正推广到每个角落，印入全体共产党员和工作干部的脑海，唤起他们的自觉，从而教育和动员广大群众共同求其实现。察南中共地委和专员公署在检讨中说，地委和专署本身有农村建设观点，却无明确的工业建设观念，他们没有以大力去教育干部和群众，使他们认识到今天矿山业已属于人民自己，应该加以爱护，反而表现出一种漠不关心的态度。既然领导机关的思想认识这样差，也就无怪下面会胡作乱为了。苏联和中国的经验都证明，要贯彻一种正确思想和消灭那种落后观念，决不是一天两天甚或三年五年所克竟功，而必须进行长期的、艰苦的、耐心的说服教育工作。必须在干部、共产党员和广大群众中，经常地反复地进行马克思列宁主义基本思想的教育，说明中国只有建设起近代化的工业，才能消灭落后、愚昧和黑暗，使大多数人民的物质和文化生活得到普遍的提高，而要建设工业，则必须保护国家财产，积蓄国家资金。必须抓紧许多具体的事件，以每一个好的和坏的例子，进行表扬和批评，奖励和处罚，借以树立国家和人民利益高于一切的崇高思想，克服自私自利的本位主义和反动的农业社会主义观念。必须在群众中造成一种舆论，就是奉公守法，忠实职守，爱护祖国财产，以神圣的劳动和智慧为国家和个人增加财富，享受应得的果实，是最大的光荣和愉快；而毁法乱纪，营私舞弊，消极怠工，窃盗和浪费公共财产，为个人的私利而剥削国家和人民的财产，是最卑鄙可耻的行为，使得即使是思想上比较落后的分子，也不能不在舆论面前循规蹈矩，而不敢进行公然的窃盗和浪费。
    第二、虽然我们共产党和人民政府领导机关和工作人员一般地都是廉洁奉公、艰苦努力的，但在某些组织内却存在着严重的官僚主义作风，这种官僚主义腐蚀了我们的机体和活力，危害到国家的利益和事业。龙烟铁矿庞家堡矿场，在整整十个月时间中，都处于被窃盗和被破坏的灾难状态，中共察哈尔省委和察南地委及人民政府察哈尔省府和察南专署，都近在咫尺，难道都一无所闻吗？然而，据记者报道，察南中共地委和专员公署，直到七月二十九日、三十日，才召开会议，专门检讨庞家堡被毁事件的责任问题。察哈尔人民省政府似乎比前者较早地注意了这件事，他们曾于本年三月至六月，三次命令宣化、龙关县政府，制止破坏；但也只限于命令而已，并未派员进行过一次实地的检查。而中共察哈尔省委也没有从党内进行保护矿场的具体组织工作。难道这样一件关系重要工矿设备，关系国家财产，关系今后工业建设的事件，如此值不得重视吗？由此可见，我们某些领导机关，因为存在官僚主义的思想作风，往往缺乏远见，不细心研究上级的指示，放松对全般事业的关心；他们容易忙于日常琐碎事务，而恰巧忽略了关系国家根本利益的重要事情。当这种事情被提醒的时候，也会以恶劣的官僚主义的态度应付，下它一个两个三个命令了事，以为命令本身便能解决一切；而不去亲自动手检查，规定具体办法，迅速加以制止，坐视国家财产继续遭受损失。因此，必须反对官僚主义，教育干部和党员扩大眼界，关心党和国家的全般事业，认识革命发展的规律和前途，提倡认真负责态度和切实细致作风，对于工作不是仅仅限于命令布置，而且要进行深入的检查督促，把每件真正着手的工作作出结果。否则，我们将会无法作好任何一件认真的建设工作。
    第三、必须建立和加强对于工厂、矿山、森林、仓库等的防护和守备工作。象庞家堡矿场这样重要的工矿地区，在初便不应该没有专人看管和武装守卫。在我们收复和接收的许多城市的工矿企业中，往往发现有的已被国民党破坏，短期内很难恢复，但其中还有许多机器设备并未完全损毁，将来会有用得着的一天。所以，必须迅速地派遣工程师、技师或专家，进行现场考查，登记机器资财，指定专人看管，配备武装防护。地方军区武装，除了剿捕土匪特务以外，今天的重要任务之一，就应是防护国家的工矿、森林。就是野战部队，如果在一个地方驻防休整，对于其附近的国家企业亦应注意保护。决不应该把某些暂时没有力量恢复的工矿企业弃置不顾，忍令其中的机器物资被不良分子偷盗或被风雨损毁，以致将来必须使国家支付大得多的资金和力量才能恢复。
    今天的中国人民正遭遇着经济上的困难。这些困难便是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义长期统治所造成的中国工业农业经济的落后状态，帝国主义和国民党反动派的封锁、轰炸、破坏，水旱风雹等自然灾害，由于战争、恢复生产和交通及接收旧机构等等而引起的支出增加，还有因为我们缺乏建设工作的器材和经验，以致使我们的经济恢复工作不能迅速展开。但是所有这些困难，都是发展中的困难，是前进过程中的困难。每一个新兴的革命的国家，当其着手恢复和重建时，都曾经历过这种困难，而终必加以克服。由于中国人民的勇敢勤劳，在中国共产党领导下，取得苏联和新民主主义国家的帮助，一定可以在三年五年时间中，初步征服这些困难，把经济工作整理出一个头绪。但正因如此，我们便更须爱护国家财产，节衣缩食，埋头苦干，从事建设。现在华东、华中、东北等许多地区都在厉行精简节约，反对贪污浪费，这便是克服困难的一个具体步骤。精简节约的目的之一，便在于减少开支，节省资金，提高工作效力，以便抽出人力物力，投入生产建设事业。但事实证明，最大的浪费，对国家财富的最大损害，就是不爱护工矿企业。每一件破坏工矿森林仓库的事故，都会使国家受到很大损失，不知要多少万人成年累月的节衣缩食才能加以补偿。如果我们一面提倡精简节约，同时又让国家重要财产继续遭到破坏，岂不是极大的矛盾，而且太有点对不起辛勤努力的前线战士和广大劳动人民了吗？因此，必须教育我们的干部、党员和广大人民，告诉他们中国经济的落后和困难情况；帝国主义和国内反动派如何正在经济上从事破坏，企图利用我们的困难，压迫我们屈服；我们在建设事业上负担了何等重大的责任。毛主席说过：“如果我们在生产工作上无知，不能很快地学会生产工作，不能使生产事业尽可能迅速地恢复和发展，获得确实的成绩，首先使工人生活有所改善，并使一般人民的生活有所改善，那就必然会使我们不能维持政权，我们就会站不住脚，我们就会要失败。”自然，我们是不愿意失败的，那么就必须首先保护国家财产，进而充分地利用这些已有的财产恢复和发展生产，制造和扩大国家的财产，提高人民的生活。
