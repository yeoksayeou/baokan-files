To the Editorial Staff:

I am a sock knitter with only one hand-operated machine, working entirely on my own without employing any workers. In June, I followed the government's decree and applied for registration at the Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau and received a business license. On July 11th, the fifth page of the *Beiping Liberation Daily* published a response from the Industry and Commerce Bureau to Mr. Li Yingkai, stating that family sock knitting, if it is a manual sideline, does not need to be registered for the time being. I think our very small-scale family production, which has recently been temporarily suspended due to sales problems, should we return the business license we already received to the Industry and Commerce Bureau? Also, should this kind of family handicraft industry pay business tax and income tax? I hope for instructions on these matters.

Sincerely,
Hu Fengding

Mr. Hu Fengding:

(1) The government's purpose in registering industrial and commercial businesses is to provide guidance to industrial and commercial businesses to facilitate the restoration and development of production. All industrial and commercial businesses in the city must be universally registered. It is good that you have complied with government decrees and registered with the government, and you should continue to do so.

(2) Mr. Li Yingkai's question on the fifth page of the *Liberation Daily* on July 11th concerns sideline occupations. Sidelines are not done regularly and are not the main source of livelihood. Your family handicraft industry, although small, is operated year-round and is the main source of livelihood. This is not a sideline and should be registered.

(3) There are certain regulations regarding the payment of business tax and profit tax. However, you should know that the tax policy of the People's Government is based on protecting and developing legitimate industrial and commercial businesses. Industrial, commercial, and handicraft industries, if they are conducive to production and construction and beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, are treated differently in taxation, with certain regulations for reductions and exemptions. If the output is small and the profit is low, consideration will be given based on the actual situation. Please rest assured that it will not be handled in the same way regardless of the profit rate and the amount of profit.

(Beijing Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau)

    凡工商业均须登记
    税收照顾具体情况编辑同志：
    我是织袜子的，只有一台手摇机，完全自己劳作，并无雇工，六月为遵照人民政府的法令，向市工商局申请登记，领到了营业证。七月十一日北平解放报第五版登载的工商局答李英凯君说：家庭织袜如系手工副业，暂不必登记。我想我们这规模极小的家庭生产，而且最近又因为销路问题暂时停止了工作，我们已经领到的营业证，是不是可以呈缴工商局？又这种家庭手工业，是不是要同样缴营业税以及营利所得税？希望一并指示。
    此致
              敬礼
            胡逢定胡逢定先生：
    （一）政府登记工商业目的，是为给工商业以方向指导，以利生产之恢复与发展，全市所有工商业要普遍进行登记，你能遵照政府法令向政府登记了很好，也应该这样作。
    （二）七月十一日解放报第五版李英凯君所问，系副业，副业是不经常作的，另方面也不是主要生活来源；你的家庭手工业虽小，如常年经营，并为生活来源主要依靠，这不是副业，是应该登记的。
    （三）关于营业税，利得税的缴纳，有一定规定，不过你要知道，人民政府的税收政策，是从保护与发展正当工商业出发的。工业商业以及手工业等，凡是有利于生产建设和有利于国计民生的，在税收上都有分别，也有减免的一定规定，如产量少而利薄，也会按实际情况，有所照顾。请你放心，不能不管利润率高低，和利润额大小一样办理。
