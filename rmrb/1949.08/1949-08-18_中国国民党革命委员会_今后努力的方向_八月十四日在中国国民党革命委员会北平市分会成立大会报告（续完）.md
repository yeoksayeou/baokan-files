    Dr. Sun Yat-sen's political thought is the guide for our actions. However, Dr. Sun's political thought was definitely not limited to one period, and our actions should not be limited to the scope of what he once said. The Tongmenghui declaration of 1905 only had a few simple slogans: "Expel the Tartars, restore China, establish a republic, and equalize land ownership." It was not until the speech given in 1906 for the publication of the Min Bao that the Three People's Principles were proposed, but the nationalism at that time was still mainly focused on overthrowing the rule of the Qing Dynasty and did not have the intention of overthrowing imperialism to seek national independence. The Principle of Democracy at that time was also limited to overthrowing the autocratic monarchy and "replacing it with French democracy." When discussing the issue of democratic politics in 1916, the Swiss democratic system was still the most admired. Dr. Sun indeed discovered very early on that China had three problems that must be solved, namely the national problem, the democratic problem, and the people's livelihood problem; but how to solve these three problems? Dr. Sun explored for a long time but was still trapped within the scope of the old democracy and could not find an accurate method. After the failure of movements such as "Punishing Yuan" and "Protecting the Constitution," experiencing the continuous support of warlords by Japanese, British, and American imperialism to obstruct the revolution, and gaining enlightenment from the Soviet October Revolution, he gradually understood that "all warlords are related to the imperialism of the great powers"; that revolutionary forces are "incompatible with imperialism like water and fire"; thus, the two major principles of anti-imperialism and anti-feudal warlords and the three major policies of alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers were born.
    Regarding the issue of China's political revolution, Dr. Sun once pointed out that capitalists are not sufficient to represent "the interests of the people" and demanded that "all common people organize a government to represent the interests of all common people"; he also pointed out: "The so-called democratic system in modern countries is often monopolized by the bourgeoisie and becomes a tool for oppressing the common people. The Principle of Democracy of the Kuomintang is shared by all common people and cannot be privately owned by a few"; it can be seen that Dr. Sun did not approve of democratic politics led by the bourgeoisie. Although he did not propose the leadership of the proletariat, it is natural to extend from disapproving of bourgeois leadership to proletarian leadership. Dr. Sun deeply knew that "poor farmers and toiling workers suffer similar pains, and their desire for liberation is extremely urgent, so their intention to resist imperialism must also be extremely strong. Therefore, the national revolutionary movement must rely on the participation of farmers and workers across the country before it can win decisively, which is beyond doubt." Therefore, he advocated: "On the one hand, the Kuomintang should fully assist the development of the farmers' and workers' movements, subsidize their economic organizations, and strive for their development, in order to increase the strength of the national revolutionary movement. On the other hand, the Kuomintang should demand that farmers and workers participate in the Kuomintang, and work together continuously to promote the progress of the national revolutionary movement. The Kuomintang is now engaged in resisting imperialism and warlords, resisting special classes that are unfavorable to farmers and workers, in order to liberate farmers and workers." Although he did not clearly propose "taking the worker-peasant alliance as the foundation," the meaning of taking farmers and workers as the main force and seeking the liberation of farmers and workers is very obvious.
    Regarding economic policy, Dr. Sun proposed "farmers should have their own land," but did not have the detailed methods now formulated by the CCP. Dr. Sun proposed "regulating capital" and explained that the main points of regulating capital are: "All enterprises of domestic and foreign people, all those with monopoly characteristics, or those whose scale is too large for private forces to handle, such as banks, railways, and sea routes, should be operated and managed by the state, so that the private capital system cannot manipulate the people's livelihood." This can be said to be completely in line with the current New Democratic economic policy. However, Mr. Mao Zedong's proposal of "developing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital" is even more complete, making it easier for people to understand. Dr. Sun did not propose "anti-bureaucratic capitalism," but this is easy to explain, because the development of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie to "manipulate the people's livelihood" was something that happened after Chiang Kai-shek came to power.
    Therefore, we believe that New Democracy is a further development, further enrichment, and clarification of the revolutionary Three People's Principles, and it is only natural for our Revolutionary Committee to support New Democracy. The new China must be led by the proletariat and must be based on the worker-peasant alliance, which has become an undoubted truth.
    Dr. Sun had several characteristics that are most worthy of our learning. First, he had a broad vision. As early as 1906, he proposed: "Our revolutionary goal is to seek happiness for the people, because we do not want a few Manchus to have a monopoly, so we want a national revolution; we do not want one monarch to have a monopoly, so we want a political revolution; we do not want a few rich people to have a monopoly, so we want a social revolution. If any of these three cannot be achieved, it is not our original intention." Therefore, he advocated: "When we implement the national revolution and the political revolution, we must also find ways to improve the social and economic organization." When we understand this, we will not only have no hesitation about the future communist society, but it is simply our duty. Second, he was courageous and forward-thinking. His revolutionary career went through countless setbacks, but not only was he not discouraged in the slightest, but he was also able to accept the experience of failure to improve his revolutionary methods. No matter what period, he always stood on the side of the revolution and fought against backward parties; in the late Qing Dynasty, he fought against the Royalist Party representing the feudal scholar-officials; in the early Republic of China, he fought against the Progressive Party representing bureaucratic politicians; later, he fought against the Northern Warlords, the running dogs of imperialism; and against the merchant groups representing the comprador class. If we learn this point, we will not become detached from the times. Third, he was pragmatic. Although he understood social revolution very early on, although he praised Lenin as a "revolutionary saint" and called on comrades to learn from the Soviet revolution, he did not immediately implement the socialist system; he was very capable of grasping China's objective reality. If we learn this point, we will not have so-called infantile disorders.

    Four

    In the past thirty years or so (since the October Revolution in the Soviet Union), although many important events have occurred at home and abroad, and the situation has undergone great changes, in short, it is nothing more than the struggle between two fronts and the changes in the situation of the two fronts. Domestically, it is the struggle between two fronts, namely the democratic national revolutionary front and the autocratic traitorous counter-revolutionary front. Internationally, it is also the struggle between two fronts, namely the anti-imperialist front and the imperialist front. The struggle between the two fronts at home and the struggle between the two fronts internationally are also closely related.
    Now, after the struggle, from the domestic point of view, the revolutionary front has overthrown the counter-revolutionary front, the autocratic and traitorous regime has collapsed, and the remaining forces of feudal bureaucratic capital have become fish in the kettle. What we need to pay serious attention to is the issue of imperialism. China has suffered deeply from imperialism, as can be clearly seen from the history of the past century. Not to mention the distant past, from Yuan Shikai to Chiang Kai-shek's harming the people and ruining the country, all are closely related to imperialism's attempt to colonize China. When Dr. Sun was about to pass away, he especially emphasized in the "Northern Expedition Declaration" and the "Northward Declaration" to "eliminate the forces of imperialism in China," believing that it was necessary to first make China independent and free before various construction plans could be realized, which we should keep in mind.
    As a result of World War II, the three powerful imperialist countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy were defeated, and the forces of the two imperialist countries of Britain and France were also greatly weakened, especially France. At present, American imperialism is the king of imperialism. It organizes and leads all the counter-revolutionary forces in the world, attacking all people who love democracy and peace in the world. China's three-year War of Liberation was to resist the slaughter of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary group, and at the same time to resist the aggression of American imperialism; the Chinese people shed boundless blood, most of which was due to the money and weapons of American imperialism.
    Although the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, the tool of American imperialism, has been overthrown, American imperialism's attempt to colonize China will never stop. It recently instigated Chiang Kai-shek, its tool in China, Quirino, its tool in the Philippines, and Syngman Rhee, its tool in South Korea, to brew the so-called "Pacific Alliance," nothing more than an attempt to maintain its supreme rule in these three countries; (from China's point of view, it is making a final dying struggle) instigating the blockade of our ports, nothing more than to obstruct the development of our people's democratic China. The so-called "five basic principles of policy toward China" announced by US Secretary of State Acheson on August 5 is no less than a declaration by US imperialism to the world that it will continue to interfere in China's internal affairs and be hostile to the Chinese people to the end! The so-called five principles are as follows: (1) "The United States hopes to encourage China to develop into an independent and stable country by all feasible means." This is truly absurd, shameless, and rogue. China is gradually gaining "independence and stability" precisely because of its three years of efforts to resist US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek group, the tool of US imperialism. In the future, to develop this "independence and stability," it can only continue to attack US imperialism and its tools, and there is absolutely no need for US imperialism to "encourage" it. We understand that what the US imperialism calls "independence and stability" is like the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek group, falling into its arms and relying on its strength for support, which is considered "independence and stability"; what it wants to "encourage" is this kind. We should pay special attention to the fact that the US imperialism wants to "encourage" China to return to the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek type by "all feasible means," that is, to return to the supreme rule of the US imperialism. (2) "The United States hopes to assist in establishing an economic and political environment in China that can guarantee basic human rights and freedoms, and gradually promote the economic and social well-being of its people." This is again absurd, shameless and rogue. We understand that "its people" referred to by the US imperialism refers to the members of the Chiang Kai-shek group, and it wants to "assist in establishing an economic and political environment in China" so that it can "guarantee" the "basic human rights and freedoms" of the members of the Chiang Kai-shek group. Otherwise, why has the US imperialism "assisted" the Chiang Kai-shek group in massacring the people with a large amount of money and weapons for the past three years when the Chinese people have been demanding "basic human rights and freedoms" from the Chiang Kai-shek group? We fully know that in any liberated area, the people's "basic human rights and freedoms" are guaranteed, and there is no need for the "assistance" of the US imperialism; what is not "guaranteed" is only the members of the anti-people Chiang Kai-shek group, and what is needed is the "assistance" of such members, and the US imperialism is precisely going to "assist" such members in making trouble in the people's China. (3) "The United States opposes China being subject to the rule of any foreign country or any regime that serves foreign countries, and opposes any foreign country dismembering China by open or covert means." This item, in addition to expressing "opposition" to our people's regime and the people's China standing on the front line of the world's anti-imperialism, also has the effect of spreading rumors and sowing discord. The so-called "dismembering China" is the same intention as the news that the imperialist news agencies often create such as "the Soviet Union controls the entire Northeast," and "the major cities in the Northeast are stationed with Soviet troops," in an attempt to arouse the world's doubts and divide those who are not sufficiently aware. However, the Chinese people will never not believe in the facts and believe in the nonsense of US imperialism. In fact, since the success of the Soviet October Revolution, it has always supported China's national liberation and people's liberation. Facts have taught the Chinese people that only by close cooperation with the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries can the aggression of imperialism be prevented or repelled. (4) "In view of the situation in the countries concerned and in the entire Far East, the United States will continue to discuss with other countries with vested interests ways to help maintain the safety and well-being of the people in this region." (5) "The United States will encourage and support the forces of the United Nations to achieve these goals, with particular emphasis on maintaining peace and security in the Far East." We will fully understand if we comprehensively consider items four and five and the "Pacific Alliance" that the three tools of Chiang, Quirino, and Rhee are brewing; there is no doubt that the so-called "Pacific Alliance" is instigated by the US imperialism, and the imperialist running dogs in "the entire Far East" will successively participate in this "alliance"; the US imperialism is going to "continue to discuss" with other imperialists "with vested interests" various "ways" to "maintain" their "safety and well-being" in "the entire Far East," that is, to undermine the people's liberation movement and the national liberation movement in "the entire Far East."
    In short, in addition to some shameless and rogue cover-up words, the attitude of the US imperialism's five so-called basic principles of policy toward China is clear; it has decided to continuously use all means to attack the people's China and to attack the national liberation and people's liberation of the entire Far East.
    How should we deal with this issue of imperialism? We must keep in mind Dr. Sun's words: "The goal of the revolution is to seek China's wealth, strength, and independence, which is incompatible with the interests of imperialism like water and fire." If we do not resist imperialism, imperialism will devour us; since we must resist imperialism, we must find friends in the world who are against imperialism. Therefore, Dr. Sun taught us to learn from the Soviet Union, to "work together with the Soviet Union in completing its historical task of liberating China and other invaded countries from the imperialist system," and to teach us to "unite with the nations in the world that treat us as equals and fight together." Therefore, our people's China should join the international anti-imperialist democratic front without any reservation. The international anti-imperialist democratic front, including the Soviet Union, new democratic countries, the people of various colonies, the proletariat of various capitalist countries, and the people's masses who support democracy and peace, has a very strong force; although the US imperialism has also organized the reactionary forces of various capitalist countries and various colonies (some of which are reactionary remnants), forming the international anti-democratic imperialist front, it is far less powerful than the former. Moreover, the former is in line with the development of history and is growing day by day; the latter is reversing the development of history and is retreating day by day. We can only form such a powerful anti-imperialist front to stop the aggression of imperialism, to ensure China's independence, and to protect world peace.
    If there are weaknesses at home and if there are sources of reaction, the clutches of imperialism will have the opportunity to reach in. Now, the complete elimination of reactionary rule and the unification of the people's China are already in sight. But this does not mean that the roots of reaction have been cut off and that it is healthy enough in itself. How can we cut off the roots of reaction and make ourselves completely healthy? The entire Chinese people must work hard on these two major events: one is land reform, and the other is industrialization. Land reform must be successful to be considered to have pulled out the roots of feudalism, to develop the rural economy, and to pave the way for industrialization; and industrialization must be successful to be able to supply our own needs and make ourselves completely independent and free. The "bottom" of "carrying the revolution through to the end" is here. Eliminating the reactionary army and seizing power from the reactionaries is not considered "to the end"; pulling out the roots of feudalism and blocking the path of imperialist intrusion is considered "to the end."
    Completing these two major events is the main task of the entire Chinese people and the entire united front in the future, and it is also the main task of our Revolutionary Committee.

    孙中山先生的政治思想是我们行动的指针。但孙先生的政治思想绝对不是停留在一个时期的，我们的行动就不必限于他曾经说到的范围。一九○五年的同盟会宣言，只有“驱除鞑虏，恢复中华，建立民国，平均地权”这几句简单的纲领。一九○六年祝民报出版的讲演，才提出三民主义，但当时的民族主义，仍以推翻满清的统治为主，并没有打倒帝国主义以求民族独立的意思；当时的民权主义，也只限于颠覆君主专制政体而“代以法兰西的民主政治”。一九一六年谈到民主政治问题，所最赏识的还是瑞士的民主制度。孙先生诚然是很早就发现了中国有三个必须解决的问题，即民族问题、民主问题和民生问题；但怎样解决这三个问题呢？孙先生摸索了很久还是被困在旧民主的范围里面，得不到准确的方法。经过了“讨袁”“护法”等等运动的落空；体验了日、英、美等帝国主义不断地支持军阀以阻挠革命，获得了苏联十月革命的启示，才逐渐了解“凡为军阀者莫不与列强之帝国主义发生关系”；革命势力是“与帝国主义如水火之不相容”的；于是才产生了反帝国主义和反封建军阀两大原则，联苏、联共、扶助农工三大政策。
    对于中国政治革命问题，孙先生曾指出资本家不足以代表“民众利益”，要求“全体平民组织政府以代表全体平民之利益”；又曾指出：“近世各国所谓民权制度，往往为资产阶级所专有，适成为压迫平民之工具。若国民党之民权主义，则为一般平民所共有，非少数人所得而私”；可见孙先生是不赞同资产阶级领导的民主政治的。虽然也没有提出无产阶级领导，但从不赞成资产阶级领导而引伸至无产阶级领导，是很自然的。孙先生深知道“贫乏之农夫，劳苦之工人，所受之痛苦类皆相同，其要求解放之情至为迫切，则其反抗帝国主义之意亦必至为强烈。故国民革命之运动，必恃全国农夫工人之参加然后可以决胜，盖无可疑者”。于是主张：“国民党于此一方面，当对于农夫工人之运动，以全力助其开展，补助其经济组织，使日趋于发达，以期增进国民革命运动之实力。一方面又当对于农夫工人要求参加国民党，相与为不断之努力，以促国民革命运动之进行。盖国民党，现正从事于反抗帝国主义与军阀，反抗不利于农夫工人之特殊阶级，以谋农夫工人之解放。”虽也没有明白提出“以工农联盟为基础”，但以农工为主力，谋农工之解放的意思是很明显的。
    对于经济政策，孙先生提出“耕者要有其田”，但还没有现在中共所订出的那样精细的办法。孙先生提出“节制资本”并说明节制资本的要旨是：“凡本国人及外国人之企业，凡有独占的性质，或规模过大为私人之力所不能办者，如银行、铁路、航路之属，由国家经营管理之，使私有资本制度，不能操纵国民生计”。这和现在的新民主主义经济政策可说是完全符合。但毛泽东先生提出的“发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利”，则说得更为完全，使人更容易明白。孙先生也没有提出过“反官僚资本主义”，但这是容易解释的，因为官僚资产阶级发展到“操纵国民生计”，是蒋介石执政以后的事。
    因此我们认为，新民主主义是革命三民主义之进一步的发展，进一步的充实与明确，我们革命委员会拥护新民主主义是很顺理成章的。新中国必须由无产阶级领导，必须以工农联盟为基础，这已经成为无可怀疑的真理。
    孙先生有几个特点，最值得我们学习。第一，他看得远大。远在一九○六年，他就提出：“我们革命的目的，是为民众去谋幸福，因不愿有少数满洲人专利，故要民族革命；不愿君主一人专利，故要政治革命；不愿少数富人专利，故要社会革命。这三样有一样做不到，也不是我们的本意”。因而主张：“我们实行民族革命政治革命的时候，须同时想法子改良社会经济组织”。我们了解到这里，岂但对于未来的共产社会毫无犹豫，简直是义所当为。第二，他勇往向前。他的革命事业经过无数次的挫折，不但没有丝毫的气馁，并且能够接受失败的经验来改进他的革命方法。无论在什么时期，他总是站在革命方面和落后的党派斗争的；在清季，和代表封建士大夫的保皇党斗争；在民初，和代表官僚政客的进步党斗争；以后又和帝国主义的走狗北洋军阀斗争；又和代表买办阶级的商团斗争。我们学习得这一点，就不致与时代脱节。第三，他实事求是。他虽然老早就懂得社会革命，虽然赞美列宁为“革命圣人”，号召同志学习苏联人的革命，但并没有立刻就实行社会主义制度的意思，他是很能把握中国之客观的实际情况的。我们学习得这一点，就不致有所谓幼稚病了。
    四
    三十多年来（苏联十月革命以来），国内和国外虽然发生过不少重要的事，形势有很大的变化，但简括地说来，不外是两条阵线的斗争和两条阵线的情形的变化。国内是两条阵线斗争，即民主民族的革命阵线和专制卖国的反革命阵线斗争。国际也是两条阵线斗争，即反帝国主义阵线和帝国主义阵线斗争。国内的两条阵线斗争和国际的两条阵线斗争，又是息息相关的。
    斗争到现在，从国内来说，革命阵线把反革命阵线打倒了，专制卖国的政权垮台了，封建的官僚资本的残余势力已成为釜底游魂。剩下来需要我们严重注意的是帝国主义问题。中国受帝国主义的祸害很深重，看一看近百年史就了然明白。远者不说，从袁世凯以至蒋介石的殃民祸国，无一不与帝国主义的企图殖民地化中国有密切关系。孙先生行将逝世的时候，在“北伐宣言”和“北上宣言”里，特别强调“消灭帝国主义在中国的势力”，认为必须先使中国获得独立自由才可以实现种种建设计划，这是我们应该牢记的。
    第二次世界大战的结果，日、德、意三个强大的帝国主义被打倒了，英、法两个帝国主义的势力也大大地削弱，尤其是法国。目前，美帝国主义是帝国主义之王。它组织与领导着世界上一切反革命势力，向世界上一切爱好民主和平的人民进攻。中国人三年来的解放战争，是反抗蒋介石反动集团的屠杀，同时是反抗美帝国主义的侵略；中国人流了无量的血，大部分是美帝国主义的金钱与武器使然的。
    美帝国主义的工具蒋介石反动集团的统治虽被推翻，但美帝国主义殖民地化中国的企图决不会停止。它最近策动在中国的工具蒋介石，在菲律宾的工具季里诺，在南朝鲜的工具李承晚，酝酿所谓“太平洋联盟”，无非是企图在这三个国家里维持它的太上的统治；（从中国来说，是作最后垂死的挣扎）策动封锁我们的港口，无非是阻挠我们人民民主中国的发展。八月五日美帝国务卿艾奇逊所公布的所谓“对华政策五项基本原则”，更不啻是美帝国主义向世界声明它要继续干涉中国内政，敌视中国人民到底！所谓五项原则是这样的：（一）“美国希望以一切可行的方法，鼓励中国发展为一独立和安定的国家”。这真是荒唐、无耻与无赖。中国正由于三年来努力反美帝和美帝的工具蒋介石集团而逐渐获得“独立和安定”，今后要发展这“独立和安定”，亦只有继续打击美帝及其工具，绝无需要美帝“鼓励”之理。我们明白，美帝所谓“独立与安定”，要象蒋介石集团统治那样，倒在它的怀里，靠它的力量支持，才算是“独立和安定”；它要“鼓励”的是这一种。我们应该特别注意，美帝是要“以一切可行的方法”来“鼓励”中国回到蒋介石之类的反动统治之下，亦即是回到美帝太上统制之下。（二）“美国希望协助在中国建立一种经济和政治环境，使能保障基本人权和自由，并逐渐促进其人民的经济和社会幸福”这又是荒唐无耻与无赖。我们明白，美帝所指“其人民”，是指蒋介石集团的分子，它要“协助在中国建立一种经济和政治的环境”，“使能保障”蒋介石集团分子的“基本人权和自由”。不然的话，为什么这三年来中国人民向蒋介石集团要求“基本人权和自由”，而美帝却以大量金钱和武器来“协助”蒋介石集团屠杀人民呢？我们完全知道，在任何解放了的地方，人民的“基本人权和自由”都有了保障，用不着美帝的“协助”；没有“保障”的只是反人民的蒋介石集团的分子，需要“协助”的只是这类分子，而美帝正要“协助”这类分子来捣乱人民的中国。（三）“美国反对中国听命于任何外国或受替外国效劳的任何政权统治，并反对任何外国以公开或隐蔽的方法肢解中国”这一项，美帝除表示“反对”我们的人民政权和人民的中国站在世界反帝国主义的阵线外，还有造谣挑拨的作用。所谓“肢解中国”，和帝国主义的通讯社常常制造什么“苏联控制整个东北”，什么“东北的大城市都驻有苏军”之类的新闻是一样用意的，企图引起世人的疑虑，企图分化认识不足的分子。但中国人民决不会不相信事实而相信美帝的胡说八道，事实上苏联十月革命成功以来一直是支持中国的民族解放和人民解放的，事实教懂了中国人民，只有和苏联及其它新民主国家亲密合作才可以阻止或击退帝国主义的侵略。（四）“美国鉴于有关国家以及整个远东的情势，将继续和其它有利益关系的国家，商讨有助于维持这一区域人民的安全和福利的办法”。（五）“美国将鼓励和支持联合国的势力以达到这些目标，尤其着重远东和平和安全的维持”。我们将四五两项和蒋、季、李三个工具所酝酿的“太平洋联盟”综合来思索，就完全明白了；所谓“太平洋联盟”是美帝策动更无疑问，“整个远东”的帝国主义的走狗们将会陆续参加这“联盟”；美帝是要“继续和其它有利益关系的”帝国主义者，“商讨”种种“办法”来“维持”它们在“整个远东”的“安全和福利”，亦即是来破坏“整个远东”的人民解放运动和民族解放运动。
    总之，美帝国主义这五项所谓对华政策的基本原则，除掉一些无耻无赖的掩饰词句外，它的态度是明显的；它决定不断地使用一切方法来打击人民的中国，打击整个远东的民族解放和人民解放。
    怎样应付这帝国主义问题呢？我们要牢记着孙先生的话：“革命之目的，在求中国之富强独立，这与帝国主义的利益如水火之不相容”。如果我们不反抗帝国主义，帝国主义就会把我们吃掉；我们既然必须反帝国主义，就必须在世界上找反帝国主义的朋友。因此孙先生教我们学习苏联，教我们“在完成其由帝国主义制度解放中国及其他被侵略国之历史的工作中，与苏联合力共作”，教我们“联合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奋斗”。因此我们人民的中国，加入国际的反帝国主义的民主阵线，是不应该有丝毫保留的。国际的反帝国主义的民主阵线，包含着苏联，新民主的国家，各殖民地的民众，各资本主义国家的无产阶级和拥护民主和平的人民大众，力量是很强大的；虽然美帝也组织了各资本主义国家和各殖民地的反动势力（有些已是反动残余），形成了国际的反民主的帝国主义阵线，但远不如前者的力量。而且，前者是顺应历史的发展的，天天在伸长中；后者是倒逆历史的发展的，天天在缩退中。我们亦只有组成这样强大的反帝国主义阵线，才能制止帝国主义的侵略，才能保障中国的独立和保护世界的和平。
    如果国内存在着弱点，存在着反动的根源，帝国主义的魔掌就有伸进来的机会。现在，完全肃清反动统治，统一人民的中国，已经在望。但这并不等于反动根源已绝，本身已够健全。怎样断绝反动根源使本身十足健全呢？全中国人民必须努力于这两件大事：一是土地改革，二是工业化。必须土改成功，才算是拔了封建的根，才能发展农村经济，为工业化敷平道路；又必须工业化成功，才能自己供给本身的需要，使自己完全独立自由。所谓“把革命进行到底”的“底”，就在这里。把反动的军队消灭了，把政权从反动者手中夺过来了，还未算“到底”；拔了封建主义的根，塞了帝国主义侵入的路，就算“到底”了。
    完成这两件大事，是今后全中国人民、整个统一战线的主要工作，同时也就是我们革命委员会的主要工作。
