　　[This City News] The health work of the Beiping City Health Bureau in the first half of the year has achieved great results. The takeover work, which began in mid-February after entering the city, was largely completed by the end of March. A total of eight hospitals, seven health centers, and nine other medical testing institutions and material depots were taken over. In the takeover, the inherent bureaucratic institutions were thoroughly smashed, and reactionary elements and major embezzlers were purged, laying the foundation for future work.

　　Vaccinating 290,000 People, Preventive Injections for 360,000 People, Disinfecting and Spraying Over 4,000 Locations

　　In terms of epidemic prevention, the first step was to carry out smallpox vaccinations and preventive injections. The spring epidemic prevention began on March 1, focusing on vaccination, followed by typhoid and diphtheria preventive injections. The summer epidemic prevention work began on June 11, focusing on cholera preventive injections, followed by vaccination, typhoid, and diphtheria preventive injections. To ensure the widespread implementation of this work, the Health Bureau established 29 epidemic prevention teams in the urban area and 11 epidemic prevention and health stations in the suburbs. It entrusted 182 public and private hospitals and clinics to provide free preventive injections to citizens. As of the end of June, a total of 290,570 people had been vaccinated, 163,041 people had received typhoid preventive injections, 193,272 people had received cholera preventive injections, and 8,721 people had received diphtheria preventive injections. The second step was DDT spraying and carbolic acid disinfection. To achieve the purpose of killing lice, flies, and disinfecting residences, DDT powder was sprayed in 2,825 locations, affecting 44,173 people and 19,867 beds in the past six months. DDT liquid was sprayed in 336 locations, covering an area of ​​4,762,300 square feet. Carbolic acid was used to disinfect 74 locations, totaling 1,219 rooms and 475 beds. To carry out spraying and disinfection work, four spraying teams and two visiting disinfection teams were established to spray and disinfect toilets, sewage ditches, garbage dumps, poor people's residences, prisons, and the residences of patients with statutory infectious diseases.

　　Clearing 200,000 Tons of Garbage, Removing 280,000 Catties of Accumulated Manure

　　In terms of environmental sanitation, the first task was to clear accumulated garbage. At the beginning of Beiping's liberation, garbage piled up everywhere in streets and alleys. The clearing work began in late March and was completed by the end of June, with a total of 200,1638 tons of garbage removed. The second task was to clear accumulated manure in the city. At the time of liberation, there was a large amount of accumulated manure in the streets and households. The work of clearing accumulated manure from households and alleys began in late February, and approximately 280,000 catties of accumulated manure were removed in just about a week. The third task was to manage the sale of cooling beverages. The registration of such businesses began in mid-May. As of the end of June, a total of 930 cooling beverage shops and vendors had been registered, and 744 types of beverages and food items had been inspected. 245 types were found to be unqualified, and those containing harmful pigments and toxins have been banned from sale.

　　Free Treatment for Over 30,000 People, Health Checkups for 50,000 Students

　　In terms of medical assistance, mobile medical vehicles were organized to provide free treatment to poor citizens in various poor areas of the city, treating a total of 31,252 people. Medical teams were also organized to treat citizens in the suburbs, treating a total of 1,462 people. Those who were introduced by district and street governments to the city's Health Bureau's affiliated hospitals and health centers for free outpatient treatment reached 26,447 people, free inpatient treatment reached 480 people, and 96 veterans' wounds were examined.

　　In terms of school health, the focus was on the city's primary and secondary schools and kindergartens. A total of 103 schools were involved, with 49,715 students. Health checkups were conducted, with 8,958 people receiving general checkups, 271 people receiving chest X-ray fluoroscopy, and 2,843 people receiving follow-up checkups for deficiencies. Various preventive vaccinations and injections were carried out. At the same time, health education was conducted, with 208 health meetings, 190 public lectures, and 82 family visits.

　　Launching Various Health Propaganda Activities, Holding Health Exhibition Conferences

　　In terms of health propaganda, various propaganda methods were adopted to popularize health knowledge among citizens. A health exhibition was held once, with 171,597 visitors. 28,000 copies of epidemic prevention leaflets were distributed, and 18,320 health slogans were posted. Nine radio broadcasts were made, 20 slide shows were screened, three wall newspapers were published, and 124 questions were answered. In addition, propaganda was carried out through lectures, talks, and family visits.

　　Other aspects include: renovating five public toilets and seven public water storage pools; conducting 10,585 prenatal, postnatal, and infant checkups; delivering 1,462 babies; conducting 9,375 family visits to pregnant women and infants; inspecting 80,748 slaughtered livestock, of which 196 were determined to be banned from slaughter; and finding ways to help unemployed medical personnel return to work.

　　Unprecedented Increase in Work Efficiency, Fewer Personnel, More Achievements

　　In the past six months, under the leadership of the People's Government, work efficiency has been significantly different from that of the pseudo-Health Bureau. The clearing of accumulated garbage is a clear example. It was not cleared during the Japanese puppet regime, and during the Kuomintang period, it took almost half a year with "American aid" and still was not cleared. However, we removed more than 200,000 tons of garbage in one go. Furthermore, in previous years, epidemic prevention personnel often numbered over a hundred, and the scope of work was limited to the urban area. This year, the number of epidemic prevention personnel was reduced by one-third, and the scope of work was expanded to the suburbs, while the results of preventive injections were almost the same as last year. For example, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang last year, although there were "American aid" materials, only 49,601 people received free treatment in half a year. This year, our Health Bureau provided free treatment to 10,040 more people than in the same period last year, which shows that the people's government is extremely concerned about the people's health.

　　In the past six months of work, there have also been many shortcomings. For example, epidemic prevention work in the suburbs is not widespread enough, medical institutions are lacking in the peripheral areas of the suburbs, the management of manure has not been completely improved, and further proper methods need to be found to thoroughly remove garbage and maintain regular cleanliness. There is insufficient publicity and education for citizens, and some citizens do not truly understand and cannot earnestly cooperate when carrying out work. All these problems must be quickly resolved in accordance with the spirit of the resolutions of the All-Circles Representative Conference. For example, pilot medical cooperatives in the suburbs to solve the problem of medical treatment for local citizens, study and improve manure management and thorough garbage removal work to maintain regular cleanliness of the environment, and universally and deeply publicize and organize the vast number of citizens to mobilize all forces to carry out epidemic prevention and health work. These huge and complex tasks require the opinions of people from all walks of life in the city, pooling wisdom and efforts to complete them together.

　　平市半年来的卫生工作
    【本市讯】北平市卫生局上半年的卫生工作，获得很大成绩。二月中旬进城后开始的接管工作、至三月底即大体完成，共接管医院八处，卫生所七处，其他医疗检验机关及材料库九处。在接管中彻底粉碎了蓄有的官僚机构，清洗了反动分子及重大贪污分子，为开展今后工作奠定了基础。
　　接种牛痘廿九万人预防注射卅六万人消毒喷射四千余处
    在防疫工作方面，首先是进行牛痘接种及预防注射：自三月一日开始春季防疫，以种痘为主，伤寒、白喉预防注射次之。六月十一日起展开夏季防疫工作，以霍乱预防注射为主，种痘及伤寒、白喉预防注射次之。为了求得此项工作的普遍进行，卫生局在城区前后建立了二十九个防疫班，在郊区设立了十一个防疫卫生站，委托了公私立医院和诊疗所一百八十二处免费为市民施行预防注射，截至六月底止，总计种痘二十九万零五百七十人，伤寒预防注射十六万三千零四十一人，霍乱预防注射十九万三千二百七十二人，白喉预防注射八千七百二十一人。其次是ＤＤＴ的喷射及石炭酸的消毒工作：为了达到灭虱、灭蝇及住所消毒的目的，半年来计ＤＤＴ粉剂喷射二千八百二十五处，人位四万四千一百七十三人，床位一万九千八百六十七个。ＤＤＴ液剂喷射三百三十六处，面积达四百七十六万二千三百平方尺。石炭酸消毒七十四处共一千二百一十九间房、四百七十五个床位。为了进行喷射及消毒工作，曾建立了四个喷射组和二个访视消毒组，向各厕所、污水沟、垃圾堆、贫民住宅、监狱及法定传染病患者住所喷射及消毒。
　　清运垃圾廿万吨除积粪廿八万斤
    在进行环境卫生工作方面，一是清除积存垃圾：北平解放伊始，街巷到处垃圾成堆，三月下旬开始了清除工作，此项工作至六月底始告完成，共计清除垃圾二十万零一千六百三十八吨。二是清除城内积存粪便：刚解放时，街巷住户积存粪便甚多，二月下旬开始清除户巷积粪工作，仅一周上下即运除积粪约二十八万市斤。三是管理清凉饮食营业：自五月中旬开始举办该项营业登记，截至六月底止，共登记清凉饮食店铺摊贩九百三十家，检验饮食物品七百四十四种，查出不合格者二百四十五种，含有害色素及毒质的，已均予制止售卖。
　　免费治疗三万余人五万学生检查健康
    在医药救济方面，组织了巡回医疗汽车，经常赴城区各贫民区为贫苦市民进行免费治疗，共治疗三万一千二百五十二人，并组织医疗组为城郊市民治病，共治疗一千四百六十二人。经区街政府证明介绍到市卫生局各附属医院及卫生所免费门诊治疗者达二万六千四百四十七人，免费住院治疗者四百八十人，检查荣退军人伤口九十六人。
    在办理学校卫生方面，重点为本市中小学校及幼稚园，经办学校一百零三校，计学员四万九千七百一十五人。举行了健康检查，计实行普通检查者八千九百五十八人，胸部爱克斯光线透视者二百七十一人，缺点复查者二千八百四十三人。举办了各种预防接种注射。同时并进行了健康教育，计开卫生会议二百零八次，公开讲演一百九十次，家庭访视八十二次。
　　展开各种卫生宣传举行卫生展览大会
    在进行卫生宣传方面，为了普及市民卫生知识，采取了各种宣传方法，计开办卫生展览会一次，参观者十七万一千五百九十七人，散布防疫传单二万八千张，广贴卫生标语一万八千三百二十张。电台广播九次，映演幻灯二十份，出版壁报三期，解答问题一百二十四件。此外并以讲演、谈话、家庭访视等方法进行宣传。
    其他方面：整修公共厕所五座及公用积水池七座；举办产前产后及婴儿检查一万零五百八十五次；接生一千四百六十二人；对产妇及婴儿家庭访视九千三百七十五次；检查屠宰牲畜数八万零七百四十八次，其中判定禁止屠宰者一百九十六次；并设法介绍失业医务人员复业等。
　　工作效率空前提高人员减少成绩增多
    半年来在人民政府领导下工作效能与伪卫生局已显然不同，清除积存垃圾就是一个显明的例子，日伪时期没有清除，国民党时期在“美援”之下几乎费了半年时间，亦未清除掉，我们却把二十多万吨垃圾一气运除了。又如往年防疫人员经常使用百余人，工作范围只限城区，今年防疫人员减少了三分之一，工作范围扩及郊区，而预防注射的成绩却与去年几乎相等。再如去年国民党反动统治时的医药救济，虽然有“美援”物资，半年中免费治疗的不过四万九千六百零一人，今年我卫生局则免费治疗人数较去年同时增加一万零四十人，这都说明人民的政权对人民健康是极度关心的。
    半年来的工作中，也存在不少缺点，例如郊区防疫工作还不够普及，郊区边缘地带尚缺乏医疗机关，粪便管理工作仍未彻底改进，彻底清除垃圾保持经常清洁问题尚需进一步另谋妥善办法，对市民宣传教育不够，进行工作时由于部分市民不真正了解而不能认真配合等。所有这些问题今后都要按照各界代表会议决议的精神迅速解决，例如在郊区试办医药合作社以解决当地市民医药治疗问题，研究与改进粪便管理及彻底清除垃圾工作，以保持环境卫生的经常清洁，普遍深入宣传与组织广大市民发动全体力量进行防疫卫生工作等。这些巨大而又繁杂的任务，都是要依靠全市各界人民提供意见，群策群力，共同来完成的。
