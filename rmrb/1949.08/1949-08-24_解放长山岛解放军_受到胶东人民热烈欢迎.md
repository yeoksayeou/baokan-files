Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 23rd - A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army that liberated the Changshan Islands in the Bohai Sea was warmly welcomed by the people of the Jiaodong liberated area, whom they had been separated from for a long time, on their way to battle. Along the 420-li road from Weixian to Huangxian, groups of people came to express their regards, braving the scorching sun and heavy rain, with slogans, gongs, drums, military music, and Yangko dances creating a lively atmosphere. Women scrambled to wash clothes for the troops, saving the best flour to make food for them; the children's corps took the opportunity while the troops were sleeping to fill the water tanks for their use. Many farmers comforted the PLA with local fruits. When a certain artillery unit entered Shahe Town in Yexian County, the whole town erupted in cheers. Residents refused to let the troops advance, insisting on keeping them to receive their comfort and warmly inquiring about the recent situation of their sons and brothers who had been away for a year or two. When the people in Yexian City heard that the troops were passing through, many crowded the streets, waiting from lunchtime until dark, until 10 o'clock in the evening, before dispersing after the troops arrived. Near Xibei Village in Yexian County, an old woman stayed by the side of the soldiers while they were sleeping, shooing away flies and covering them with blankets. By the time the soldiers discovered her, she had been guarding them for two consecutive days. The people's enthusiastic care gave the troops great encouragement. Disregarding the fatigue of the long march and the difficulties of island warfare, the commanders and fighters launched an attack on the Changshan Islands on the evening of August 11th and completely occupied the seven islands of North and South Changshan by the 12th, annihilating more than 1,400 enemy troops.

　　解放长山岛解放军
  　受到胶东人民热烈欢迎
    【新华社济南二十三日电】解放渤海长山岛的人民解放军某部，在出发作战时一路上备受久别重逢的胶东解放区人民的欢迎。从潍县到黄县四百二十里的大路上，每天有成群结队的群众，冒烈日和大雨前来慰问，口号、锣鼓、军乐、秧歌响成一片。妇女们抢着给部队洗衣服，留着好面给部队吃；儿童团则趁部队睡觉时，挑满水缸给部队用。许多农民以土产水果慰劳解放军。当某炮兵部队进入掖县沙河镇时，全镇响起了一片欢腾声，居民不让部队前进，一定要留下接受他们的慰劳，热烈地询问阔别一两年的子弟兵的近况。掖县城内的人民听到部队要经过时，不少人拥挤街头，从午饭后等到天黑，一直等到十点钟，部队到达后才散去。掖县西圩碑附近有一个老大娘，在战士们熟睡的时候，守在旁边给赶苍蝇，盖被单，待战士们发现时，她已经一连守了两天了。人民的热情爱护，给了部队以极大的鼓舞。指战员们不顾长途行军的疲劳和海岛作战的困难，八月十一日晚对长山列岛发起攻击，至十二日即完全占领了南北长山等七个岛屿，歼敌一千四百余名。
