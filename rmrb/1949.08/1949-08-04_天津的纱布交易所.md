    The Gauze Exchange in Tianjin
    By Our Correspondent in Tianjin, Wei Jin
    The Emergence of the Exchange
    Before the liberation of Tianjin, under the policy of speculation and hoarding by Kuomintang bureaucrat capitalists, gauze became one of the main objects of speculation for speculators. Not only the more than 700 gauze merchants engaged in speculation on gauze, but also various industries not engaged in gauze business speculated on it. Tianjin was the largest gauze supply base in North China. When gauze became an object of speculation, it not only triggered fluctuations in gauze prices in the city, but also affected gauze prices in various markets in North China, and sometimes even drove fluctuations in food and even all commodities. After the liberation of Tianjin, the forces of speculators and hoarders still remained, constantly stirring up trouble in the gauze market. In order to ban such speculation and hoarding and stabilize gauze prices, so as to protect the profits of legitimate gauze manufacturers and facilitate the development of urban and rural trade, the government established a gauze exchange in May.
    Overview of the Exchange
    The gauze exchange is an administrative organization under the direct leadership of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, concentrating buyers and sellers in one place for transactions in order to facilitate the management of market order and the adjustment of market supply and demand. Merchants entering the exchange for transactions can freely entrust traders to introduce and complete transactions. Gauze prices are freely determined by buyers and sellers through open negotiation without restrictions. For completed transactions, the buyer pays the exchange a handling fee of two per thousand of the total transaction value (including the trader's commission). The exchange provides the following conveniences for merchants' transactions: 1. Because it is stipulated that transactions must be conducted on a cash-on-delivery basis, and speculation is prohibited, legitimate gauze manufacturers can be free from the scourge of speculation and hoarding, maintain reasonable profits, and concentrate on their business; 2. Buyers and sellers trade directly, eliminating the "price eating" by matchmakers (matchmakers are traders, and price eating is intermediate exploitation. In the past, in business practice, buyers and sellers often did not meet, and matchmakers mediated, taking the opportunity to eat the price. Now that buyers and sellers trade directly, matchmakers, in addition to earning handling fees for introducing transactions, cannot eat the price); 3. Once a transaction is completed, under the supervision of the exchange, the transaction becomes legal. Even if disputes arise between buyers and sellers (such as buying fake brands), the exchange is responsible for appropriate handling; 4. Centralized transactions facilitate sales for sellers and purchases for buyers. Since its establishment, the exchange has attracted a wide range of merchants, including those from major cities in North China and Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, Jinzhou, Andong, Jilin, Dalian in Northeast China, Xuzhou, Jinan, Yantai in East China, and Xi'an in Northwest China. According to statistics from May 25 (the day of opening) to July 25, the total transaction volume of cloth was 9067.5 pieces (20 bolts per piece, the same below), and the total transaction volume of yarn was 8553 bales (40 bundles per bale, the same below). Most of these are sold to various places outside the city with the development of urban and rural trade, in addition to some sold in the city.
    How Does the Exchange Control the Gauze Market?
    In order to enable the exchange to achieve the goals of centralized transactions, timely understanding of market supply and demand, appropriate adjustment of supply and demand, stabilization of gauze prices, and elimination of speculative manipulation, the government adopted two measures to lead the exchange: First, strengthen administrative management. Regulations: 1. All transactions of cotton yarn in bales and cotton cloth in pieces must be conducted in the exchange; 2. The units participating in the exchange transactions must be various industries that are truly engaged in the production and management of gauze. All speculative and manipulative elements must not enter the exchange for transactions; 3. All personnel conducting transactions in the exchange must pay cash on delivery and must not engage in illegal activities such as speculation, futures trading, speculation, rumor-mongering, and price-gouging. Second, in coordination with administrative management, based on the principle of "taking into account both public and private interests," unite all public and private gauze supply institutions in the city (that is, all sources of goods) – the Municipal Trade Department's Gauze Company, the China Cotton Yarn Company, and the four major private textile factories, Hengyuan, Beiyang, Dasheng, and Huaxin – to participate in transactions in the exchange. They set up offices in the exchange, concentrated a large number of transactions through the exchange, and understood the market supply and demand situation. Then, with the public gauze supply institutions as the main force (because the gauze volume controlled by the Gauze Company and the China Textile Company accounts for 80% of the gauze volume of all factories in the city) and the private gauze supply institutions as the auxiliary force, they jointly took out sufficient strength to appropriately buy and sell, adjust supply and demand, so that gauze prices could be reasonable and relatively stable.
    The government's implementation of these two measures has enabled the exchange to gradually control the huge gauze market. First, because the exchange is a centralized large number of transactions, and at the same time unites all public and private gauze supply institutions in the city, and has sufficient strength to adjust supply and demand, the gauze prices controlled by the exchange play a leading role outside the exchange. The city's gauze market – and even the gauze markets in North China and other places – must follow the gauze prices of the exchange (for example, the city at that time followed the exchange's price fluctuations, Tangshan and Beiping were slightly half a day later, and Shenyang, Jinan, Dezhou, Shijiazhuang and other places were slightly two or three days later due to transportation). Second, because the gauze prices controlled by the exchange are reasonable and relatively stable, it is more difficult for speculative and manipulative elements to operate. When speculators reselling gold and gauze were hit by the government in early April, they once threatened to make a comeback, but after the establishment of the gauze exchange in May, they had to be more cautious. Yonghe Lane in the first district of Harbin Road was once the largest concentration of speculative activities in the city. Now it is calm and quiet. It is said that some speculators have begun to switch careers. Under this circumstance, gauze began to change from consistent resale to large-scale actual sales. According to statistics in June, the total transaction volume of yarn and cloth was 8310 (bales and pieces). Excluding 2547 (bales and pieces) that were speculative resale components, the actual sales volume reached 5763 (bales and pieces), accounting for 69% of the total transaction volume of 8310 (bales and pieces). In the era of speculative manipulation by Kuomintang bureaucrat capitalists, even if such a total transaction volume was reached – or exceeded – it is estimated that less than one-tenth or one-fifth was actual sales.
    How Has the Exchange's Work Been Carried Out?
    The exchange was prepared in April and opened on May 25. At the beginning, there was a lack of experience. Relying on listening to the opinions of the masses and constantly improving the management and equipment in the exchange, the business gradually developed.
    At the beginning of the exchange's opening, the method of open outcry trading was adopted (that is, the trader called out the price on the stage), but the merchants were not used to it, forming mutual observation and hesitation (that is, sellers waited for higher prices to sell, and buyers waited for lower prices to buy), affecting normal transactions, and the transaction volume was very small. Later, after listening to the opinions of merchants, it was changed to "free negotiation" (that is, everyone dispersed and negotiated prices freely), and the transaction volume increased slightly; however, most of the merchants still traded outside the exchange, which was far from the requirement of concentrating transactions within the exchange. After continuing to listen to various feedback and conducting a comprehensive review and research, it was found that there were still many shortcomings in the management of the exchange: 1. Insufficient publicity about the exchange, merchants did not understand the nature of the exchange and transaction procedures, forming a sense of mystery about the exchange; 2. Too serious inspection of the exchange transaction certificates, creating strict access control, and merchants did not dare to enter the exchange to see what was going on; merchants from afar did not know that they had to have local procedures to prove that they wanted to enter the exchange for transactions, and could not enter the exchange for transactions; 3. Insufficient telephones hindered contact with the outside world (for example, some merchants needed to quickly adjust their stores according to the market situation in the exchange, etc., which required timely telephone contact); 4. Transaction documents had to be stamped with a number stamp, but merchants have never been in the habit of carrying number stamps out of the house; 5. The time limit for cash-on-delivery transactions was not clear, and merchants did not dare to conduct transactions. Based on these circumstances, the exchange clearly stipulated that the greatest requirement in the early stage of its establishment should be to achieve centralized transactions. To this end, the new working methods were determined: 1. Through meetings and newspapers, widely publicize the purpose and intention of the government in running the exchange, so that merchants can understand the benefits of the exchange; 2. Relax the criteria for entering the exchange for transactions (such as welcoming merchants to enter the exchange to observe the transaction situation; foreign merchants without local procedures to prove it, with proof from legitimate merchants in the city, can also be allowed to enter the exchange for transactions, etc.); at the same time, the transaction procedures in the exchange should be as convenient as possible according to general business practices (such as adding four telephones to facilitate contact with the outside world; clearly stipulating the time for cash-on-delivery transactions, etc.); 3. Cooperate with the tax bureau and the public security bureau to inspect illegal transactions outside the exchange (that is, dispersing gauze in bales and pieces for transactions outside the exchange) to reduce transactions outside the exchange. After these methods were implemented, merchants gradually increased their transactions in the exchange, and the transaction volume increased day by day. The total transaction volume of cotton yarn in one week was 263.5 bales, and the total transaction volume in the fifth week reached 1022 bales. The total transaction volume of cotton cloth in the first week was 566 pieces, and it reached 983 pieces in the fifth week; the total transaction value was 5,384,650 yuan on May 25 (the day of opening), and it reached 180,179,500 yuan on June 30. From these figures, according to general feedback, the current transactions in the exchange are more than transactions outside the exchange.
    Problems Existing in the Exchange
    (1) Centralized transactions are still difficult. In order to enable the exchange to achieve centralized transactions, so as to manage market order, and to facilitate understanding of market supply and demand, appropriately adjust supply and demand, and control gauze prices, the government has stipulated that all transactions of cotton yarn in bales and cotton cloth in pieces must be conducted in the exchange. However, some merchants, in order to evade taxes, disperse gauze in bales and pieces for transactions outside the exchange, so that transactions outside the exchange still account for a certain amount, hindering centralized transactions in the exchange. In the future, education on laws and policies must be strengthened for such merchants; at the same time, punitive regulations should be stipulated for merchants who repeatedly refuse to change after education. In addition, the market's supply and demand for gauze is quite large, and one exchange cannot fully meet the market requirements (such as floral cloth and colored cloth are all traded outside the exchange), which is also the reason why the exchange cannot concentrate transactions well. Therefore, more exchanges must be added in the future.
    (2) Traders have not been well reformed, affecting the development of work. The current traders have been engaged in their own business for many years and have been infected with many bad habits in the business world. Their view of serving the exchange is not very clear. In order to attract more merchants to ask them to introduce transactions, so as to get more handling fees (in fact, a person can usually get 3,000 to 4,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan in handling fees every day). On the transaction documents, Tianjin merchants are written as Beiping merchants, the firm is written as a person's name, the real name is written as a fake name, and the store is written as a hawker, and one industry is written as another industry. In this way, it is a bit difficult for the exchange to understand the faces of the merchants and the true situation of the transactions. For these, of course, the basic thing is education and reform, but for the worst elements who repeatedly refuse to change after education, appropriate punishment or cleansing must be carried out.

    天津的纱布交易所
    本报驻津记者  维进
    交易所的产生
    天津解放前，在国民党官僚资本投机囤积的政策实施下，纱布成为投机商最主要的投机对象之一；不仅经营纱布的七百余家纱布商对纱布进行投机，就是不是经营纱布的各个行业也对纱布进行投机。天津是华北区最大的纱布供应地，当纱布成为众所投机的物品的时候，不仅掀起本市的纱布价格波动，亦影响华北各个市场的纱布价格波动，有时甚至带动粮食以至百物波动。天津解放后，投机囤积分子的势力尚在残存，不断在纱布市场兴风作浪。政府为了取缔此种投机囤积的行为，稳定纱布价格，以便保障正当纱布厂商的利润，和便于开展城乡贸易，乃于五月间设立纱布交易所。
    交易所概况
    纱布交易所就是在工商局直接领导下，集中买卖双方在一块交易以便于管理市场秩序及便于调剂市场供需的一种行政性质的组织机构。客商入所交易，可自由委托交易员介绍成交。纱布价格由买卖双方自由订定，公开讨还，不加限制。成交的交易，按交易总值，买方向交易所缴纳千分之二的手续费（包括交易员的佣金）。交易所对于客商交易的便利条件是：一、由于规定必须现款现货交易，不得买空卖空，这就使得正当的纱布厂商都能免除投机囤积的祸害，保持合理的利润，安心营生；二、买卖双方直接交易，免除跑合的“吃价”（跑合即交易员，吃价即中间剥削。过去商场习惯，买卖双方交易，多是两头不见面，由跑合的从中周旋，跑合的便乘间吃价，现在买卖双方直接交易，跑合的除介绍成交赚手续费外，不能吃价）；三、交易作成，在交易所监督下，交易成了合法，以后买卖双方即使发生纠葛（如买到假牌货等）交易所负责适当处理；四、集中交易，卖方便于推销，买方便于购买。交易所成立以来，参加交易的客商非常广泛；包括华北区各大城市及东北的沈阳、长春、哈尔滨、锦州、安东、吉林、大连，华东区的徐州、济南、烟台，西北区的西安等地的客商。据五月二十五日（开办的一天）至七月二十五日两月来统计，布的成交总量九○六七·五件（每件二十匹，下同），纱的成交总量八五五三包（每包四十捆，下同）。这里面除一部分销售于本市，绝大部分随着城乡贸易的开展，销售于市外各地。
    交易所如何掌握纱布市场？
    政府为使交易所能够达到集中交易，及时了解市场供求情况，适当调剂供需，稳定纱布价格，杜绝投机操纵的目的，对于交易所的领导采取两种措施：第一、加强行政管理。规定：一、凡棉纱成包棉布成件以上的交易，必须在交易所进行；二、参加交易所交易的单位，必须确实是以生产纱布及经营纱布为业之各行业，一切投机操纵分子不得进所交易；三、凡在交易所进行交易之一切人员，一律要现款现货，不得有买空卖空，期货辗转，投机取巧，造谣哄价等不法行为。第二、在行政管理配合下，本着“公私兼顾”的原则，团结全市所有的公营、私营的纱布供应机构（也就是全市所有的货源）——市贸属的纱布公司、中纱公司及私营的恒源、北洋、达生、华新四大纺织厂等——在交易所参加交易。他们在所内设立办事处，通过交易所集中大批的交易，了解市场供求情况后，于是以公营纱布供应机构为主（因纱布公司与中纺公司掌握的纱布量占全市各厂纱布量百分之八十），私营纱布供应机构为副，共同拿出充足的力量，适当吞吐，调剂供需，使纱布价格得到合理和比较稳定。
    政府实行这两种措施的结果，使得交易所能够逐渐掌握庞大的纱布市场。首先，由于交易所是集中的大批的交易，同时又团结全市所有的公、私营纱布供应机构，有充足的力量调剂供需，于是，交易所掌握的纱布价格，便在所外起着主导作用；全市的纱布市场——甚至华北等地的纱布市场——都要跟着交易所的纱布价格走（如本市当时跟着交易所的价格涨落而涨落，唐山、北平则稍迟半天，沈阳、济南、德州、石家庄等地，因交通关系，则稍迟二三天）。其次，由于交易所掌握的纱布价格是合理和比较稳定，投机操纵分子的活动比较困难。当四月初，投机商倒卖黄金纱布受到政府打击后，曾经扬言卷土重来，但是五月间纱布交易所成立后，他们不得不有所顾忌。一区哈尔滨道永和里，曾是全市投机商活动最大的集中地，现在这里冷静静的，据说有些投机商已开始转业。在这种情形下，纱布开始由一贯的倒卖，变为大量的实销。据六月份统计，纱与布的成交总量为八三一○（包与件），除去二五四七（包与件）是带有投机倒卖的成分之外，实销的达五七六三（包与件），占成交总量八三一○（包与件）的百分之六十九强的实销量。在国民党官僚资本投机操纵时代，即使达到——或者超过——这样的成交总量，据估计，是占不到十分之一二是实销的。
    交易所工作如何开展起来？
    交易所筹备于四月间，开办于五月二十五日。开始经验缺乏，依靠听取群众意见，不断改善所内管理与设备，业务才逐渐开展。
    交易所开业之初，采取喊价交易（即交易员在台上喊价），商人均不习惯，形成互相观望、犹豫（即卖者等待价高再卖，买者等待价低再买），影响正常成交，成交数量很少。后来听取商人意见，改为“自由散讲”（即大家分散，自由议价），成交数字稍有增加；但是商人在所外交易的仍占绝大多数，距离集中所内交易的要求相差很远。经过继续听取各方反映及进行全面检讨研究后，发现交易所在管理上尚存在许多缺点：一、对交易所宣传不够，商人不大懂得交易所的性质及交易手续，形成对交易所莫明其妙；二、过于认真检查入所交易证，造成门禁森严，商人不敢进所一看究竟；远道的商人，不知入所交易要有当地手续证明，无法入所交易；三、电话不够，妨碍与所外联系（如有些商人，要根据所内行情，迅速调整自己的门市等，都需电话联系才及时）；四、成交单据要加盖号章，但商人的习惯，向来不随便带号章出门的；五、规定现款现货交易的时间限制不明确，商人不敢进行交易。根据这些情况，交易所明确规定：在成立初期，首先应以达到集中交易为最大要求。为此，决定新的工作办法：一、通过会议与报纸，广泛宣传政府办交易所的目的和用意等，使商人了解交易所的好处；二、放宽入所交易的尺度（如欢迎商人入所参观交易情形；外商无当地手续证明，有本市正当商人证明，亦能通容入所交易等）；同时所内交易手续，按一般商业习惯，尽量使之便利（如增设电话四部，以便与所外联系；明确规定现款现货交易的时间等）；三、配合税局、公安局检查所外的非法交易（即以成包成件的纱布，分散在所外交易），以缩小所外交易。这些办法实行后，商人入所交易逐渐增加，成交日有起色。棉纱一个礼拜的成交总量为二百六十三包半，第五个礼拜的成交总量达到一千零二十二包，棉布第一个礼拜的成交总量为五百六十六件，第五个礼拜达到九百八十三件；成交总值五月二十五日（开办的一天）为五、三八四、六五○元，六月三十日达到一八○、一七九、五○○元。从这些数字中，依据一般反映，目前所内交易已比所外交易占多数。
    交所存在的问题
    （一）集中交易尚有困难。政府为使交易所能够达到集中交易，以便管理市场秩序，和便于了解市场供求情况，适当调剂供需，掌握纱布价格，曾规定凡棉纱成包、棉布成件的交易，必须在交易所进行。但是，有些商人为了逃税，把成包成件的纱布分散在所外交易，致使所外交易仍占一定数量，妨碍所内集中交易。今后对于这种商人必须加强法令政策教育；同时对于累次教育不改的商人，应该规定惩罚的条例。另外，市场的纱布供需相当庞大，一个交易所不能完全适应市场要求（如花布、色布都在所外交易），这也是交易所不能很好集中交易的原因，因此今后必须增设交易所。
    （二）交易员尚未很好改造，影响工作开展。现时的交易员都是从事本身业务多年，染有商场中的许多恶习，为交易所服务的观点很不明确。他们为了多拉拢客商叫自己介绍成交，以便多拿手续费（其实一个人普通每天已能拿到三四千元到一万元手续费）。在成交单据上，把天津的客商写成北平的，把商号写成人名，把真名写成假名，把门市写成摊贩，把这一行业写成另一行业。这样交易所要了解客商的面貌和交易的真实情况就有点困难。对于这些个当然基本上是教育改造，但对于累次教育不改的最坏分子，必须适当处罚或洗刷。
            （完）
