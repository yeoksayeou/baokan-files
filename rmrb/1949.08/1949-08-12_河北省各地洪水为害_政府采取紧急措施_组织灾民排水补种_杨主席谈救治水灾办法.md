    Hebei Province Floods Cause Damage in Various Areas
    Government Takes Emergency Measures
    Organizes Disaster Victims for Drainage and Replanting
    Chairman Yang Discusses Methods for Disaster Relief

    [By Our Newspaper] Hebei Province has experienced widespread flooding this year, with some areas also suffering severe typhoon damage, significantly impacting agricultural production. To understand the disaster situation and the government's relief measures, this reporter recently visited Comrade Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, who discussed the following:

    Since late June, the entire province of Hebei, except for the southwestern former Jinnan and Taihang regions which had less rainfall, the central and northern former Jidong, Jizhong, and Beiyue regions have experienced continuous heavy rainfall. Rainfall in many areas has reached 400 millimeters, exceeding the highest rainfall levels in North China in recent years. For example, the rainfall in Baoding exceeded 1.5 times the normal annual rainfall. Consequently, water levels in various rivers have continuously surged, with some exceeding recent levels. For example, the water level of Baiyangdian on August 7th was 10.86 meters, exceeding the highest water level in 1939; the water level of the Daqing River in Xinzhen on August 5th was 9.69 meters, exceeding the highest water level in 1939 by 3.5 decimeters; the flow rate of the Ziya River at Zangqiao on July 28th was 400 to 500 cubic meters per second, exceeding the flood levels remembered by the masses over the years. Despite strenuous efforts to rescue many areas, overflowing and disasters were unavoidable. Many counties in the former Jizhong Eighth and Tenth Special Districts experienced continuous heavy rains, and low-lying areas were flooded. The former Jidong region and coastal areas were also affected by typhoons. The left bank of the Ziya River in the Dacheng and Jinghai sections was eroded for 40 to 50 li. According to representatives from the Tangshan Special District, the region was generally hit by typhoons, especially in the coastal areas, and the combination of wind and water damage caused significant devastation. As of August 5th, dikes and embankments had breached in 36 counties across the province, affecting 972 villages and inundating 26,119 hectares of land. Flooding disasters occurred in the lower reaches of rivers in 12 counties, affecting 462 villages and inundating over 15,000 hectares of land. Rain-induced floods occurred in 24 counties, affecting 1,321 villages and inundating over 23,000 hectares of land. The above figures may not be comprehensive due to the extensive area affected by this year's floods, lack of transportation, and the changing situation. The severity of the disaster is also not yet fully understood. However, it is generally estimated that approximately 6 million mu of land has been flooded, affecting approximately 2 million people. The wind disaster that occurred in the former Jidong region from July 29th to 31st was most severe along the coast and the Great Wall line.

    The main reason for this year's flooding is the excessive flow of water in various rivers, making it difficult to prevent and control with the available resources. Leading organizations at all levels have generally made great efforts in this year's flood prevention work, playing a significant role in leading rescue efforts, closing breaches, and personally directing flood prevention work (when water levels rise, commissioners and county heads generally go to the dikes in person, some even undressing and working with the masses in the water to carry out rescue efforts). This point should be affirmed first and foremost. Of course, there are still a few cadres who have not paid enough attention to flood prevention work in their leadership thinking, and there is a sense of complacency and a mentality of taking chances. For example, some believe that if the upstream has breached, the downstream will no longer be in danger; some have arbitrarily withdrawn civilian workers, relaxed the defense of embankments, or left their posts without authorization; some administrative departments believe that flood prevention work is only the responsibility of the flood prevention headquarters, and do not actively cooperate when river defenses are in an emergency; some cadres, due to localism, do not consider the "subordination of small interests to large interests" in flood diversion and drainage, resulting in inappropriate measures; in some areas, flood prevention organizations suffer from ineffective command or insufficient intelligence communication. Although these are only a few partial phenomena, they are extremely harmful to the entire flood prevention work and have been corrected. In addition, the heads of flood prevention headquarters in various places are mostly concurrently held by local administrative department heads. When the water situation is urgent, temporary command is chaotic and unable to understand the overall situation, causing no small amount of problems. Experience and lessons should be learned and improvements should be made quickly. The condition of the engineering facilities of various rivers is currently being checked.

    Chairman Yang then analyzed the disaster situation, saying: "In areas where flooding has occurred and the water is relatively shallow, some crops can still be harvested. In some areas, late-maturing crops (such as buckwheat) or wheat can be replanted after the water recedes; in areas affected by breaches, late-maturing crops can also be replanted after attempts are made to drain the water, and most areas can still be planted with wheat."

    Finally, Chairman Yang told the reporter: "The provincial government attaches great importance to this disaster. In addition to issuing a notice to all localities that flood prevention should be the current central task during the flood season when rivers continue to rise, strengthening flood prevention organizations and fully investing in flood prevention and rescue, it has dispatched investigative teams composed of responsible cadres from various departments and offices on August 4th and 8th to convey emergency instructions, inspect flood prevention work, understand the disaster situation, and express condolences to the disaster victims; the Water Conservancy Bureau has dispatched technical personnel to survey and plan breach-closing projects where possible. The provincial government's economic departments are working together to organize disaster victims to produce and adjust food and fuel. It also plans to request grain from the North China People's Government for emergency relief to help poor, unproductive, and extremely difficult orphaned, widowed, and elderly disaster victims, and plans to lend some grain to the masses to help solve the difficulty of seeds for engaging in sideline production and rush planting. In order to prevent epidemics in the disaster area after autumn, the provincial government, in addition to organizing medical teams and local doctors to carry out prevention, will also request the North China People's Government to send medical teams to assist in the work due to the vastness of the disaster area and insufficient manpower."

    河北省各地洪水为害
    政府采取紧急措施
    组织灾民排水补种
    杨主席谈救治水灾办法
    【本报讯】河北省今年普遍发生水灾，部分地区并曾遭受严重的台风袭击，对于农业生产甚有影响，记者为了解灾情和政府已采取的救治办法，特于日前往访河北省人民政府主席杨秀峰同志，承谈如下：
    自六月末旬以来，河北全省除西南部原冀南、太行两区雨量较小外，中部、北部原冀东、冀中、北岳区均连续大雨。不少地区的雨量，已达四百公厘，超过华北近年最高雨量，如保定雨量超过常年雨量的一点五倍，因之各河水位不断暴涨，有的已超过近年水位：如白洋淀八月七日之水位为十点八六，超过一九三九年之最高水位；大清河新镇八月五日之水位为九点六九，超过一九三九年最高水位三点五公寸；子牙河七月二十八日臧桥流量为四百到五百秒立方公尺，超过群众历年所记忆之洪水。不少地区虽经大力抢救仍不免漫溢成灾。原冀中八专十专不少县份，连日大雨，低洼地区积水成灾，原冀东区及沿海各地并受风灾波及。子牙河大城、静海段，左堤被侵刷四十到五十里。据唐山专区来人谈，该区普遍遭到台风袭击，尤以沿海各地为甚，再加上水害，造成了很大的灾害。截至八月五日止，全省各河堤埝漫决者三十六县，共九七二村，被淹土地二万六千一百一十九顷；各河下游泛滥成灾者十二县，共四六二村，淹地一万五千余顷；因雨涝成灾者廿四县，共一、三二一村，淹地二万三千余顷。以上数字因今年水灾面积过大，交通工具缺乏，和情况尚在变化中，估计可能不够全面，受灾轻重亦尚不很清楚。但总的估计，被淹地约有六百万亩，受灾人口二百万左右。原冀东区七月二十九日到三十一日发生的风灾，以沿海及长城线最严重。
    造成今年水灾的原因，最主要的是由于各河水势过大，在今天现有的物资基础上，难于防治，各级领导机构在今年的防汛工作上，一般都曾尽了极大的努力，在带头抢险、堵口和亲自领导防汛工作方面（在水涨时，专员县长一般都亲自上堤，有的并脱光衣服在水中和群众一起抢救。）起了很大作用，这一点是首先应该肯定的。自然仍有少数干部在领导思想上，对防汛工作不够重视，存在着麻痹与侥幸心理，如有的认为上游已决口，下游便不会再有危险；有的擅自撤退民工，放松堤岸防守，或擅离工作岗位等；有的行政部门认为防汛工作只是防汛指挥部的事，河防紧急时，主动配合不够；有的干部对于分洪排水，由于本位主义，不从“小利服从大利”着眼，以致措施失当；有的地区的防汛机构存在着指挥不灵，或情报联系不够等。这一些虽只是少数的部分的现象，但对整个防汛工作则是极为有害的思想，已进行纠正。此外各地防汛指挥部多为当地行政部门负责人兼任，水情紧急时，临时指挥忙乱，不能了解全盘情况，误事不小，应吸取经验教训，迅速加以改进。至于各河工程设施如何，现正检查中。
    接着杨主席分析了灾情情况，他说：因泛滥成灾而水较浅的地区，部分庄稼还可有一些收成，部分地区在水脱后，可以抢种晚熟作物（如荞麦）或种麦；因决口成灾者，部分地区也可以设法排水下种晚熟作物，大部地区还可以种麦。
    最后杨主席向记者说：省府对于这次的灾情十分重视，除已通令各地在汛期未过各河仍继续涨水期间，应以防汛为当前的中心工作，加强防汛机构，全力投入防汛抢险外，已于八月四日和八日先后派出由各厅、处负责干部组成的调查组，到各地传达紧急指示，检查防汛工作，了解灾情和慰问灾民；水利局派出技术人员勘察可能堵口者计划堵口工事。省府各经济部门协力组织灾民生产，调剂粮食燃料。并拟请求华北人民政府拨粮进行急赈，以救济贫苦无力生产、生活极端困难的孤寡老弱灾民，并拟以若干粮食贷给群众，帮助解决从事副业生产和抢种时的种籽困难。为防治灾区秋后发生疫病，省府除组织医疗队及各地医生进行防护外，以灾区很广，力量不够，并拟请华北人民政府派医疗队协助进行。（林洪）
