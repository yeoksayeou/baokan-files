    Hua University Holds Graduation Ceremony for 5,000 Students
    Commander-in-Chief Zhu Urges Perpetual Humility in Learning

    [This newspaper reports] Following the glorious embarkation of 12,000 revolutionary students from the Revolutionary University onto their work posts, over 5,000 students from the first division of North China University in Peiping held their graduation ceremony yesterday (31st). Commander-in-Chief Zhu personally attended and delivered a speech. Principal Wu Yuzhang, Vice-Principal of the Revolutionary University Hu Xikui, Vice-Principals of Hua University Fan Wenlan and Cheng Fangwu, Dean of Studies Nie Zhen, all staff members of Hua University, as well as students from the second, third, and fourth divisions, were also present to participate.

    Amidst the majestic strains of the Hua University school song, the ceremony commenced. After Dean of Studies Nie Zhen delivered the opening remarks, Commander-in-Chief Zhu appeared on the stage and gave a speech to all graduating students, providing specific instructions on participating in practical work. The Commander-in-Chief first encouraged the students to go and work wherever the People's Liberation Army advances, to combine with the underground cadres who were active before liberation in the local areas, and through them, establish connections with the local masses, rely on the workers, unite the peasants, serve them wholeheartedly, establish a new political power, a new culture, and a new economy, and take root among the local masses. The Commander-in-Chief earnestly exhorted the students not to think that they had learned a set of principles at Hua University and become arrogant, but to remember Chairman Mao's teaching to "put down the airs of a conceited person, and willingly be a pupil." Secondly, the Commander-in-Chief explained that the experiences in Wuhan and Shanghai-Nanking have proven that if the countryside is not revolutionized, it is very difficult to maintain isolated liberated cities. Therefore, in newly liberated areas in the future, the following steps will likely be taken: After the cities are liberated, efforts will be immediately concentrated on taking over, eliminating the remaining hidden forces of the counter-revolution, and stabilizing social order. After the situation in the cities is relatively stable and the takeover work is largely completed, a significant portion of the forces will be immediately diverted to the countryside to eliminate landlord armed forces and bandits, liberate the peasants, and coordinate with urban construction. Therefore, the Commander-in-Chief encouraged the students not only to do well in urban work but also to go to the rural areas where the revolution needs them most. The Commander-in-Chief continued to point out that after the revolutionary war ends, economic construction will become the most important task nationwide. At the same time, trade union work will also occupy a paramount position on the road to national industrialization. Therefore, the Commander-in-Chief hoped that students would stand firm on the working class's stance in their future work. Finally, the Commander-in-Chief encouraged the students with "Live and learn" to continue learning, continue progressing, constantly improve themselves, transform themselves, and always be good students of Chairman Mao in their work.

    Principal Wu Yuzhang spoke to the students in an earnest tone. He expounded on the path of human development and the laws of social development, enabling students to further understand the times and strengthen their confidence in finally defeating reactionary factions at home and abroad. Secondly, Principal Wu briefly explained the roles and combat effectiveness of the various military, economic, and cultural tasks that the students would soon be participating in, hoping that students would overcome all difficulties encountered with strong determination, learn to master and apply the Party's policies, consciously abide by discipline, and become a member of the fighting, strong organization. Principal Wu also put forward the Hua University motto "Loyalty and unity, simplicity, humility" to encourage students to constantly train themselves and complete the new tasks of the new era.

    Vice-Principal Hu Xikui of the Revolutionary University stated that 40,000 educated youths in North China had participated in revolutionary work after the liberation of Peiping and Tientsin. He hoped that students would continue to learn and move forward in their work after initially establishing a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary outlook on life. After Vice-Principal Fan Wenlan of Hua University spoke, the student representative delivered a farewell speech. Then, representatives of the graduating students from the first division excitedly took the stage to deliver a reply. They recounted the learning process of the past three months, saying, "When we entered the school, we had all sorts of personal plans and motivations. After three months of transformation, when it comes to job assignments, 5,000 people have only one motivation—to go where the revolution needs us most! It is the Chinese Communist Party that has liberated us from the oppressive burden of backward, old ideas." He shouted his gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the education and cultivation of Hua University. He guaranteed that the students would always follow the Communist Party and be good fighters for Mao Zedong. (Jin Feng)

    [Further News] The graduating students of the first division of Hua University will be dispatched to work in the vast regions of North China, Northwest China, and South China. Those going to the South will depart in three or four days, while those going to the Northwest will depart around the beginning of August. During this period, they will learn how to do mass work and ethnic policies. (Jin Feng)

    华大五千学生行毕业礼
    朱总司令叮嘱永远虚心学习
    【本报讯】继革大一万二千革命学生光荣踏上工作岗位之后，华北大学第一部在平学生五千余人昨（三十一）日举行毕业典礼。朱总司令亲临讲话，吴玉章校长、革大副校长胡锡奎，华大副校长范文澜、成仿吾，聂真教务长与华大全体工作人员以及二部、三部、四部学生都到场参加。
    雄伟的华大校歌声中，典礼开始，聂真教务长致开会词后，朱总司令出现在台上，他向全体毕业学生，作了关于参加实际工作的具体指示的演讲。总司令首先勉励同学解放军打到那里就到那里工作，要与当地解放前的地下干部相结合，经过他们与当地群众建立联系，依靠工人团结农民，一心一意为他们服务，建立新政权、新文化、新经济，在当地的群众中生根下去。总司令谆谆叮嘱同学不要自以为在华大学了一套，自高自大，而要切记毛主席“放下臭架子，廿当小学生”的教导。其次，总司令说明由于武汉和京沪的经验证明乡村没有革命化，孤立的解放了的城市是很难维持的，因此今后在新解放地区大概会采取这样的步骤：城市解放以后，立即集中力量，进行接管，肃清反革命的残余潜伏力量，稳定社会秩序，而在城市的局面相当稳定、接管工作大体结束以后，就立即分出很大一部分力量转向农村，肃清地主武装、土匪，解放农民，配合城市建设。因此，总司令鼓励同学不仅要把城市工作做好，还要到革命最需要的农村中去工作。总司令继续指出：革命战争结束以后，经济建设在全国将成为头等重要的工作，同时工会工作在全国工业化的道路上也将占有头等重要的地位，因此，总司令希望同学在今后工作中，要站稳工人阶级的立场。最后总司令以“活到老，学到老”勉励同学在工作中继续学习，继续进步，不断提高自己，改造自己，永远作个毛主席的好学生。
    吴玉章校长以亲切的语调向同学讲话，他阐述了人类发展的道路和社会发展的规律，使同学进一步认识时代，坚定最后战胜国内外反动派的信心。其次，吴校长逐一简要说明同学即将参加的军事、经济、文化各项工作的作用和战斗性，希望同学以坚强力量克服一切遇到的困难，学习着掌握和运用党的政策，自觉地遵守纪律，成为战斗的坚强的组织的一员。吴校长并提出华大校训“忠诚团结、朴实、虚心”勉励同学时刻锻炼自己，完成新时代的新任务。
    革大胡锡奎副校长说明平津解放后华北已有四万知识青年参加革命工作，他希望同学在初步建立马列主义革命人生观后，还要在工作中学习，继续前进。华大范文澜副校长讲话后，学生会代表致欢送辞，接着一部毕业同学代表兴奋地上台致答辞，他历述三月来的学习过程，他说：“入学时有各式各样的个人打算和动机，三个月的改造，分配工作时五千个人只有一个动机——到革命最需要的地方去！这是中国共产党把我们从落后的旧的思想重压下解放出来了。”他高呼感谢中国共产党，感谢毛主席，感谢华大的教育培养。他保证同学永远跟着共产党走，做毛泽东的好战士。（金凤）
    【又讯】华大一部毕业学生将分发赴华北、西北及南方广大地区工作。赴南方者将于三四日后动身，赴西北者则将于八月初旬左右启程。在此期间，则将进行学习如何做群众工作及民族政策等。（金凤）
