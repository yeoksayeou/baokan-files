Regarding Comrade Wang Tao’s question about whether Party and government personnel from the rear can ride in military vehicles, according to Article 26 of the Military Transport Regulations, "When passengers are crowded, if there are empty seats in military vehicles, passengers shall be allowed to ride in military vehicles at the request of the conductor." According to the above principle, when passengers are crowded and there are empty seats in military vehicles, ordinary passengers are allowed to ride, so there is naturally no problem with Party and government personnel riding. However, under normal circumstances, passengers shall not mix with soldiers in order to maintain discipline. This is a restriction stipulated in the military transport regulations promulgated by the Military Commission. However, when revising the regulations in the future, we can submit Comrade Wang Tao's opinions for discussion.

　　党政人员可否坐军用车
  　铁道部答问王韬同志：
    所提问之后方党政人员，可否在军用军内乘坐一节，按军运条例第二六条规定“在旅客拥挤时，如军用车内有空席时，须应车长的请求，准许旅客在军用车内乘坐。”根据上项原则在旅客拥挤而军用车内有空席时，既准许普通旅客乘坐，党政人员自更不成问题。至在通常情况下，旅客不得与军人混坐，以维整肃之纪律。这是军委所颁布军运条例的限制，但在将来修订条例时，我们可将王韬同志的意见提出讨论。
