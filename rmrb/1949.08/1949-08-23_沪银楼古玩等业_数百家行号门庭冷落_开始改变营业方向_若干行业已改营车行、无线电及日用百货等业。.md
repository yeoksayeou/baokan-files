　　Shanghai Silversmiths, Antique Dealers, and Other Businesses
　　Hundreds of Businesses See Decreased Patronage
　　Begin to Change Their Business Focus
　　Some Industries Have Already Switched to Operating Vehicle Shops, Radio Shops, and Daily Necessities Shops.
　　[Shanghai News] A portion of the luxury goods stores in this city, such as silversmiths, jewelers, and antique dealers, have recently been changing their business focus one after another. Among them, the more than 180 members of the silversmith industry are experiencing sluggish business. The more than 200 firms in the jewelry and antique industry are also seeing decreased patronage. Some shareholders and employees in the silversmith, jewelry, and antique industries deeply understand that changing the business direction is the only way out. Around the 10th of this month, the Hongxiang Jewelry Store at Tongfu Road and Fuxu Road has already transformed into Hongxiang Vehicle Shop, selling bicycles. The Xinbaocheng Silversmith at Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road has switched to selling radios. The Fang Jiuxia Silversmith near Nanjing Road and Xizang Road has been converted into a distribution point for the Sanyou Industrial Society, which was a solution proposed by the thirty-plus employees of Fang Jiuxia Silversmith. International and Pinzhen Jewelry Companies have also switched to operating department stores. The Coral Forest Antique Circulation Center has been converted into a sewing machine factory. Fuyuanzhai Antique Shop had already been engaged in the business of consignment sales of general merchandise. At a business meeting recently convened by both labor and management at the China National Products Company, the issue of exclusively selling daily necessities was also raised, with the intention of fundamentally and thoroughly changing the direction of business operations.
　　[Further News] Amidst the trend of luxury goods stores changing their business direction, the city's stamp shops are also contemplating changing their business. Chengji Stamp Shop on Sichuan Middle Road has already posted "Happiness and Longevity Pastries" advertisements in its windows, partially switching to the business of selling bread and pastries.
　　In addition, in order to develop their business, the city's paper merchants are preparing to transform from intermediaries into producers, directly investing in the papermaking industry, and changing their business direction.

　　沪银楼古玩等业
  　数百家行号门庭冷落
  　开始改变营业方向
    若干行业已改营车行、无线电及日用百货等业。
    【上海讯】本市一部分奢侈品的商店，如银楼、珠宝、古玩等行业，近来正纷纷改变营业方向。其中银楼业一百八十多家会员，生意清淡；珠宝古玩业的二百多家行号，也都门庭冷落。一部银楼、珠宝、古玩等三业的股东和从业员，都深深了解只有转变营业方向才是唯一的出路。在本月十日左右，即已有同孚路福煦路口的鸿祥珠宝首饰店，已经改变成为鸿祥车行，经售脚踏车；南京路山西路口的新宝成银楼改卖无线电。南京路近西藏路口的方九霞银楼，改成三友实业社的分销处，这是方九霞银楼三十几位职工提出来的办法。国际和品珍等首饰公司，亦已改营百货，珊瑚林古玩流通处改为缝纫机制造厂，福源斋古玩店也早就在经营代客寄售百货的业务。中国国货公司在举行由劳资双方新近组成的业务会议上，亦已提出专售日用必需品的议题，预备从根本上彻底改变业务经营的方向。
    【又讯】在奢侈品的商店改变营业方向声中，本市邮票社也正在酝酿改业，四川中路的成记邮票社，已经在橱窗上贴起“喜寿糕点”的招贴，部分改营面包糕点的业务。
    又本市纸商业为了发展业务，正预备从中间转手商变成生产者，直接投资于造纸工业，改变营业的方向。
