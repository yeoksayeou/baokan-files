    Henan Localities Review Bandit Suppression Work
    Overcome Complacency

    [This newspaper dispatch] Hankou News: At the end of last month, various localities in Henan, based on the resolutions of the Second Henan Provincial Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, conducted in-depth reviews of past bandit suppression work. According to the reviews at expanded meetings of the county committees in Huangchuan, Luyi, Luoyang, Neixiang and other places, while there have been considerable achievements in past bandit suppression work, the following two deviations are commonly present:

    1. Cadre Ideological Complacency: Due to the rapid development of the national victory situation, there is insufficient understanding of the transformation of bandits from concentrated, open armed resistance to dispersed, latent activities. They are easily numbed by some superficial phenomena and relax bandit suppression work. For example, in Huangchuan County, after eliminating more than 600 bandits in June, some cadres believed that the bandits had been wiped out. Some cadres in Luyi County believed that the whole country would soon be liberated, and that a few bandits could not cause major problems, showing an underestimation of the enemy. Bandits, targeting this weakness of our cadres, use softening tactics, making the cadres' thinking even more complacent. Therefore, once there is bandit disruption, they fall into panic due to insufficient ideological preparation.

    2. Policy Ideological Ambiguity: There is an unclear understanding of the main policy of bandit suppression—mobilizing the masses, with political offensives as the main approach and military suppression as a supplementary one. Many cadres do not handle situations correctly based on the principle of punishing the ringleaders severely and not questioning those who were coerced, while rewarding those who render meritorious service. Some even kill and beat people indiscriminately, forcing guns and bullets, hindering the work of winning over and disintegrating the enemy. Conversely, there are also tendencies of unprincipled leniency and excessive rightism. For example, some areas in Huangchuan did not dare to publicly announce the principle of punishing the ringleaders severely in order to win over bandits to surrender.

    The county committees in various counties have now clearly instructed that the above two deviations must be quickly and effectively corrected, otherwise, they will inevitably become detached from the masses and cause serious political errors. Through this inspection, cadres in general have become more vigilant ideologically and have a deeper understanding of the bandit suppression policy, laying a solid foundation for carrying out in-depth bandit suppression work in the future.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 9th: Kaifeng and Zhengzhou cities have achieved considerable results in public security work in the past six months. The Kaifeng Public Security Bureau has cracked more than 20 sabotage cases involving secret agents and reactionary secret societies, and 146 cases of banditry, robbery, and murder in the past six months; Zhengzhou has captured a total of 285 secret agents, secret society leaders colluding with secret agents, and "shock team members," and registered 2,500 reactionary party, league, and secret agent members. The two cities have seized 73 bandit and secret agent radio stations, more than 1,000 rifles and pistols, five light machine guns, as well as generators, searchlights, and some drugs. These bandit and secret agent elements, lurking in the cities, robbed and murdered citizens, spread rumors to confuse the public, and plotted riots, committing all kinds of evil. The public security organs of the two cities have respectively convened public security meetings, deciding to further strengthen investigation work and thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandit and secret agent elements.

### 河南各地检讨剿匪工作  克服麻痹思想

    河南各地检讨剿匪工作
    克服麻痹思想
    【本报讯】汉口消息：河南各地上月末旬根据中共河南省第二次党代表会议的决议，深刻检讨过去的剿匪工作。据潢川、鹿邑、洛阳、内乡等地县委扩大会上的检讨，认为过去的剿匪工作有不少成绩，但普遍存在着下面的两种偏向：
    一、干部思想麻痹：由于全国胜利形势的迅速发展，对土匪由集中公开的持枪反抗，转化为分散的潜伏活动，认识不足，易被一些表面现象所麻痹，放松剿匪工作。如潢川县六月份歼股匪六百余，就有干部认为土匪已经肃清。鹿邑县有些干部认为全国即将全部解放，几个土匪闹不出大事来，有轻敌思想。土匪针对我干部这一弱点，进行软化，使干部思想更加麻痹。故一旦有土匪扰乱，因思想准备不足，便陷于惊慌失措。
    二、政策思想模糊：对剿匪的主要方针—发动群众，政治攻势为主，军事清剿为辅—认识不清，有不少干部不是根据首恶必惩，胁从不问，立功受奖的原则分别情形正确处理，甚至有的乱杀乱打，逼枪逼子弹，防碍争取瓦解工作。反之也有无原则宽大和过右的偏向，如潢川有的地区为争取土匪投降，竟不敢把首恶必惩一条公开宣布。
    现各县县委已明确指示，必须迅速切实地纠正以上两种偏向，否则，必将脱离群众，造成严重的政治错误。各县通过此次检查，一般干部思想上已引起警惕，对剿匪政策有了进一步的认识，替今后深入开展剿匪工作，奠定稳固基础。
    【新华社开封九日电】开封、郑州两市半年来治安工作，获得不少成绩。开封公安局半年来共破获特务及反动会门破坏案二十余起，土匪抢劫杀人案一百四十六件；郑州捕获特务分子、与特务分子勾结在一起的会门头子、“突击队员”共二百八十五名，登记反动党、团特务分子二千五百名。两市共缴获匪特电台七十三部、长短枪一千余支、轻机枪五挺，及发电机、探照灯、毒品一部。这些匪特分子，潜伏市内，抢劫杀害市民，造谣惑众，阴谋暴动，无恶不作。现两市公安机关已分别召开公安会议，决定进一步加强侦缉工作，彻底肃清残余匪特分子。
