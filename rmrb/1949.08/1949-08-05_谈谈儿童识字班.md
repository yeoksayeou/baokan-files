Talking About Children's Literacy Classes
    Hong Bo

    The Sixth District's literacy classes for out-of-school children have been running for four months. The following experiences have been summarized during this period of work:

    I. Encouragement and Enlightenment are Better Than Corporal Punishment

    The undisciplined nature of out-of-school children is cultivated in the old society. Therefore, when organizing them to enter school, we should not be too hasty in management, nor should we make excessive demands, and even less should we adopt corporal punishment. Because corporal punishment is an old thing and a bad system that limits the development of children's talents. Today, in the new society, it must be completely eliminated. Experience has proven that encouragement and enlightenment are better than corporal punishment, and the effect is very significant. For example, at the beginning of the establishment of the Xinghua Literacy Class, some children fought, and the teacher's persuasion was not heeded. Some even threw stones at the teacher. At that time, some teachers advocated that corporal punishment was necessary, otherwise, it would be impossible to manage them. After some research and debate, it was decided to encourage good students who abide by school rules and, at the same time, conduct enlightenment education for bad students to make them also want to strive to be good students. Under the gradual influence of education, many students who did not abide by school rules initially became aware. Especially during the district-wide good student campaign, some bad students quickly transformed into good students.

    II. Children's Meetings Should Be Held; Talk More About Yourself, Less About Others.

    Four months of work experience has proven that holding children's meetings is absolutely necessary. Holding meetings is a good way to develop children's talents and enlighten their self-awareness. But one thing to pay attention to when holding children's meetings is to talk more about yourself and less about others. Because children are most fond of talking about the shortcomings of others. If it is not properly controlled, it is easy to form disputes. The children's meeting of the Xinghua Literacy Class was held under the guidance of the teacher. In addition to discussing classroom homework problems, they also conducted criticism. In criticism, the emphasis was on self-criticism. For example, some children said: "I dozed off in class today." Some said: "I fought with a classmate." After saying this, the chairman (also elected from among the children) solicited opinions from everyone. At this time, the teacher should provide timely guidance, focusing on education and enlightenment, so that children have a preliminary improvement in their understanding, increase their interest in holding group meetings, and cultivate children's democratic habits, thereby gradually overcoming the phenomenon of indiscipline.

    III. Focus on Culture

    In the literacy class, some teachers talk about what is imperialism, what is bureaucratic capitalism, etc. But the teachers themselves are not very clear about it, so they have to mechanically copy from books or explain nouns with nouns, which not only has no effect but also increases the burden on the children. Therefore, in literacy classes, we should focus on cultural education. If we want to teach political lessons, it should only be limited to the fifth and sixth grades, and we should only tell some popular and simple stories.

    谈谈儿童识字班
    洪波
    六区失学儿童识字班，已有四个月的历史，这一段工作期中，总结出下列几点经验：
    一、鼓励、启发胜体罚
    失学儿童的散漫性，是在旧社会养成的，所以在组织入学之初，对管理上既不应过于性急，也不应该要求过高，更不应该采体罚的办法。因为体罚是旧的东西，是限制小孩天才发挥的坏制度。今天在新的社会里，必须完全去掉，从工作的经验中证明，鼓励、启发的办法胜于体罚，而且效果非常大。例如在兴华识字班成立之初，有的小孩打架，先生劝说不听，竟有拿石头打先生等事发生，当时有的先生主张非体罚不可，否则是没法管理的；经过一番研究争论后，决定：将守校规的好学生，予以鼓励，同时进行对坏学生的启发教育，使他们也希望争取当个好学生；从慢慢的教育影响下，使不少的不守校规的学生，初步的觉悟了，尤其是在全区好学生运动时，有的坏学生很快地转变成好学生了。
    二、小孩会，应该开，多说自己，少说旁人。
    四个月的工作经验证明，开小孩会是完全必要的。开会是发挥小孩天才与启发自觉性的好办法。但开小孩会时要注意一点，即多说自己，少说旁人。因为小孩最爱说别人长短的。如果不适当掌握，容易形成纠纷。兴华识字班的小孩会，是在先生的辅导下召开的，他们除了讨论课内功课问题外，并进行批评。在批评时着重在自我批评方面。如有的小孩说：我今天上课打盹了。有的说：我和某同学打架啦。当说了之后，由主席（亦是小孩中选出来的）向大家征求意见，在此时先生应及时辅导，着重在教育与启发，这样使小孩认识上有个初步的改进；提高了开小组会的兴趣；并培养儿童的民主习惯，从而逐渐地克服了散漫现象。
    三、注重文化
    在识字班中，有的先生讲什么是帝国主义、什么是官僚资本主义等问题；但是先生自己也弄不很清楚，只好硬搬书本或以名词解释名词，结果不仅没有什么效果，反而增加了儿童的负担。因此，在识字班里，应着重文化教育，如果要讲政治课的话，也只能限于五、六年级，并且只能讲些通俗浅显的故事。
