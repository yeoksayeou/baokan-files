    Using Wooden Sticks as Pens and Broken Pottery Shards as Slates, Most Illiterate People Learn to Read in One Month
    [This newspaper dispatch] News from the North China Military Region: In the process of carrying out regularization education, all commanders and fighters in the North China Military Region recognized that learning culture is the key to improving military and political skills, and a wave of enthusiasm for learning culture has been set off. In this learning upsurge, the soldiers of the ××× Division eagerly studied like thirsty people. They used wooden sticks as pens and broken pottery shards as slates, getting up early and going to bed late, seizing all kinds of time to study. After a month of the study movement, most of the 20% to 30% of illiterate people in the division had learned five or six dozen characters. The more intelligent and diligent soldiers could learn more than a dozen new characters every day, recognizing two or three hundred characters in a month. Many soldiers in Group C were promoted to Group B. The vast number of soldiers in the ××× Division, in order to learn culture, gave up their small smoking habits and saved money from their pocket money to buy pencils, pens, and paper. In the past two months, the division has added nearly a thousand pens. Comrade Yang Zheng, deputy company commander of the Third Company of the ××× Regiment, said: "If you ask me to fight, I won't be awkward. Openly fight, it's no big deal to put in more effort, but when I encounter things that take brains and lead people, I'm stumped. I'm a rough guy, I can't read, and I rely on my brain to remember things. People report ten things to me, I remember six, and when I report to the superiors, I lose another one; it's the same when the superiors assign work. This has become a mental burden, and I must study culture well to overcome this difficulty." Ren Deshui, a cook in a certain unit, was a shepherd. When he joined the army last October, he didn't know a single character. In this study movement, he was selected as a first-class study model. In the test, in addition to reciting and writing down all forty lessons of the New Three Character Classic, he also recognized more than a thousand characters. According to the experience of the ××× Division, the reason why the soldiers study so hard is mainly due to the leadership's conscientious organization and leadership. In order to make up for the shortage of cultural teachers, the division selected a group of soldiers and squad and platoon cadres with higher cultural levels in the company to serve as cultural teachers and small teachers. These cultural teachers and small teachers can correctly recognize their responsibilities, actively help soldiers learn, and learn from each other to exchange experiences and improve teaching methods. In addition, mass and diverse tests were conducted, which greatly stimulated the comrades' desire to improve.

　　学习文化是部队提高军事政治的钥匙
  　华北军区各部队
    热烈学习文化
    用木棍当笔用破盆片当石板一个月来大部文盲学会认字
    【本报讯】华北军区消息：华北军区各部队，在开展正规化教育中，全体指战员认识了学习文化是提高军事政治的锁钥，纷纷掀起学习文化热潮。在学习热潮中，×××师的战士们如饥似渴的积极学习。他们用木棍当笔，用破盆片当石板，早起迟睡，抓住各种时间学习。该师经过一个月的学习运动以后，全师百分之二十到三十的文盲，大部分都已学会五六十个生字，比较聪明勤勉的战士每天能学到十多个生字，一个月识了二三百字，好多丙组战士都升到乙组去了。×××师的广大战士，为了学习文化，纷纷把小烟瘾都忌了，从自己的零用中节省下钱买铅笔、钢笔、纸张，两月来全师增加钢笔近一千枝。×××团三连副连长杨正同志说：叫我打仗我不蹩扭，敞开打，多卖把气力没什么，但碰到费脑筋，带领人的事，就抓瞎了。咱是个老粗，大字不识，办什么光凭脑子记，人家跟咱汇报十件事记住六件，再跟上级汇报又丢了一件；上级布置工作时也是这样。这就成了思想负担，我一定要把文化学习好，克服这个困难。某部炊事员任得水，出身是个放羊的，去年十月入伍时一个字不识，在这次学习运动中被选为一等学习模范。在测验时他除了把新三字经上的四十课全部背下写下外，还识了一千多个生字。战士们学习之所以这样努力，据×××师的经验，主要是由于领导上认真组织领导的结果。该师为补足文化教员的不足，在连队中选拔了一批文化较高的战士和班排干部当文化教员和小教员。这些文化教员和小教员都能正确认识自己的责任，非常积极的帮助战士学习，并且互相学习交流经验，改进教学方法。此外并进行了群众性、多样性的测验，大大激发了同志们的向上心。
