Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: Sydney News: Australian coal miners, who have been on strike for nearly seven weeks, are determined to continue their struggle until their demands are recognized. According to TASS, in addition to insisting on the release of arrested union leaders and the cancellation of union fines, the miners also demand the withdrawal of the army currently working in the mines.

The Moscow Red Navy News commented on the Australian coal mine strike on the 6th, saying: This strike is one of the important milestones in the post-war working class's struggle for peace, freedom, and against exploitation and oppression. The new offensive of Australian capitalists against the working class is closely related to the military preparations of the Pacific Pact and the capitalists' attempt to avoid the impending economic crisis. The way this offensive is carried out is to try to further exploit the workers. The anti-labor policy of the Australian Labor government is the cause of the miners' strike. The government refused to meet the legitimate demands of the workers, and in response to the government's actions, 24,000 coal miners held a general strike. In terms of organization and scale, this strike is the largest in the history of the Australian workers' movement. The Labor government ordered the freezing of union funds, prohibited the withdrawal of funds to support striking workers, and arrested and imprisoned many union leaders. However, these autocratic measures cannot destroy the spirit of the workers' struggle for their rights. Due to the Australian miners' strike, Australia's industry and transportation have almost been completely paralyzed. The policies implemented by the Chifley-Evatt government have opened the eyes of those workers who previously believed the official propaganda that the Labor Party safeguards the interests of the workers. Their anger at the Australian Labor Party's anti-labor policies is growing. Mass rallies protesting the government's arrest of senior union leaders have been held across the country. Some Labor Party members have left the Labor Party and joined the ranks of the Communists.

    红海军报评澳煤矿罢工
    是战后工人阶级斗争重要里程碑之一
    是澳国工人运动史上最大的一次罢工
    【新华社北平七日电】悉尼讯：坚持罢工近七周的澳大利亚煤矿工人，决心继续斗争，直到他们的要求获得承认为止。据塔斯社报道，矿工们除坚持释放被捕工会领袖取消工会罚款外，并要求撤出现在矿场工作的军队。
    莫斯科红海军报六日评论澳大利亚的煤矿罢工称：这一罢工是战后工人阶级争取和平自由反对剥削压迫的斗争的重要里程碑之一。澳大利亚资本家对工人阶级的新攻势是与太平洋公约的军事准备工作以及资本家想要避免迫在眉睫的经济危机的企图密切相关的。这个攻势所采取的方式是力图对工人加以更进一步的剥削。澳大利亚工党政府的反劳工政策是矿工罢工的原因。政府拒绝答应工人的合法要求，为了回答政府的行动，二万四千煤矿工人举行了总罢工。就其组织与规模来说：这次罢工是澳大利亚工人运动史上最大的一次。工党政府下令冻结工会基金，禁止提取基金来支持罢工工人，并将许多工会领袖拘捕入狱。可是这种专横措施并不能破坏工人为争取权利而斗争的精神。由于澳大利亚矿工罢工，澳洲的工业及运输几乎已全部陷于瘫痪。齐佛莱——伊瓦特政府所施行的政策，已使以前还相信所谓工党维护工人利益的官方宣传的那些工人们睁开眼睛。他们对于澳大利亚工党反劳工政策的愤怒正在日益增涨。抗议政府逮捕工会高级领袖的群众大会已在全国各地举行。已有某些工党党员退出工党而加入共产党人的队伍。
