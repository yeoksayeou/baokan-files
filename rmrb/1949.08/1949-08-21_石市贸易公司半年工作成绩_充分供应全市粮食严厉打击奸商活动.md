　　Shijiazhuang Trading Company's Half-Year Work Achievements
　　Fully Supplying the City with Grain, Severely Cracking Down on Profiteering Merchants
　　[Baoding News] Shijiazhuang Trading Company has achieved considerable success in adjusting supplies, stabilizing prices, and ensuring supply in the past six months.

　　According to the company's statistics, from February to the end of June this year, it has transferred and transported over 40 million jin of various coarse and fine grains from Tianjin Head Office and from neighboring trading companies in Dezhou, Linqing, and Hengshui. The weight of general merchandise and hardware also exceeded one million jin. Since grain prices changed in various places in March, private individuals almost completely stopped transporting grain to the market. More than 80 percent of the food sold in the city's grain stores and stalls was supplied by the trading company. From March to June, an average of about 40,000 to 100,000 jin were transported daily to grain-deficient areas around the city and disaster areas in Lingshou. In terms of general merchandise, prices in large cities such as Tianjin rose in April and May, exceeding those in the city, so private merchants stopped transportation. The trading company immediately vigorously sold goods, supporting the adjustment of goods in the market. This huge amount of adjustment work played a significant role in guaranteeing the city's economic construction and the people's lives in the surrounding areas, and demonstrated the fighting power of state-owned commerce.

　　When grain prices fluctuated in March, April, and May, the trading company, in close cooperation with party and government organs and transportation departments, cracked down on speculative merchants and curbed price increases. At the same time, it consistently supplied grain to employees of public factories, schools, and government agencies at a fixed price for five days, twice a month, according to the wage and rice price evaluation in the middle and end of the month. Organized citizens were supplied through cooperatives at a 5 percent discount on the daily price, totaling about 3 million jin of grain per month. In order to facilitate citizens' purchases, the company adopted the method of distribution through street cooperatives and many grain stores and stalls. Therefore, the trading company has become an indispensable part of the people's economic life.

　　石市贸易公司半年工作成绩
  　充分供应全市粮食严厉打击奸商活动
    【保定讯】石家庄贸易公司近半年来，在调剂物资、稳定物价、保证供给等工作上获得相当收获。
    从本年二月份到六月底，据该公司统计，从天津总公司和从德州、临清、衡水等邻区贸易公司前后共调剂运至该市各种粗细粮数达四千余万斤，百货五金等按重量统计也在百万斤以上。自从三月份各地粮价发生变化后，粮食市场上私人运来者几全部停止，全市各粮行粮摊所经售的食粮占百分之八十以上为贸易公司所供给；并且经商人贩运到四周缺粮区和灵寿一带灾区者，从三月到六月平均每天在四万斤到十万斤左右。在百货等方面，四、五月份天津等大城市价格上涨，高出该市，私商因而停运，贸易公司当即大力出售，支持了市场上物品的调剂。这一巨大数额的调剂工作，对该市的经济建设及市周围地区的人民生活，起了很大的保证作用，发挥了国营商业的战斗力量。
    当三、四、五月份粮价发生波动时，贸易公司除与党政机关及交通部门等各方面密切配合，打击投机奸商，遏止物价上涨外，同时，对各公营工厂、学校、机关等职工，每月按照月中月底两次评定工资米价，一向坚持五天不动牌价供给，对有组织之市民，经过合作社按照平日牌价九五扣供给，每月共需粮三百万斤左右。并为便利市民购买，曾经采用了通过各街合作社和不少的粮店粮摊代为配售。因而贸易公司成为人民经济生活中不可缺少的一部分。
