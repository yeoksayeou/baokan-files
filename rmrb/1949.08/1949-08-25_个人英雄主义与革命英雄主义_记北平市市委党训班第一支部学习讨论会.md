Individual Heroism and Revolutionary Heroism
    ——Notes from the Study and Discussion Meeting of the First Branch of the Party Training Class of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee
    Editor's Note: This discussion on individual heroism versus revolutionary heroism has been able to closely connect with reality in its method, conducting analysis and criticism. However, from the many facts listed by everyone, has the boundary truly been drawn, the viewpoint clarified, and are the conclusions reached completely correct? It is hoped that everyone can further elevate their actual experiences to theoretical principles, and trace the roots to derive basic methods for overcoming individual heroism and establishing revolutionary heroism.
　　Does Individual Heroism Have a Progressive Role?
    "Chairman!" A comrade spoke: "Let me start with something that happened to me. Before liberation, I worked on 'Beiping Student' (a student publication of Tsinghua University). In order to discuss the cessation of publication and settlement of accounts, someone needed to go into the city and also carry dozens of letters to underground liaison groups in various schools in the city to be delivered. At that time, it was very tense. There were checks at the city gates, and sudden inspections at Qihe Lou. Carrying these things was very dangerous. However, I requested this task from the organization. What was I thinking at the time? I saw the comrades who had been arrested and released returning, and they were so glorious among the students; listening to them talk about their heroic struggles was so admirable. Wasn't this a good opportunity for me to show my heroism? So I was not only unafraid, but even hoped for a sudden inspection. But it didn't happen; I completed the task safely. So, comrades, think about it, doesn't individual heroism also have benefits for revolutionary work?"
    People strongly disagreed, citing many examples of serious losses to revolutionary work caused by individual heroism to oppose him, and pointed out: "Take the comrade who worked on 'Beiping Student' as an example. His momentary surge of individual heroism was not only not beneficial to revolutionary work, but was actually harmful! He hoped for a sudden inspection, which meant that he would be negligent in his task and would not try every means to deal with the enemy and avoid the enemy. Fortunately, there was no inspection that time. If there had been, think of the great damage it would have brought to revolutionary work! The organizational relationships of dozens of schools would have been discovered by the secret police, and he might have been arrested. Can we say that individual heroism is beneficial to the revolution?"
    "I think individual heroism is made up of two things: one thing is individualism, and the other is heroism. Individual heroism has a harmful side because it doesn't recognize the laws of revolution, and considers everything from an individual perspective. Conversely, striving for the revolution is heroism, which is a progressive side. We should abandon individualism and promote heroism." A comrade put forward such a noteworthy opinion.
    "Saying it like that will cause confusion in people's minds. Individual heroism is something of a certain class. After you divide it like that, does it still have its class character? To what class does the heroism you praise belong?"
    "Individual heroism is something of the exploiting classes. Individual heroes exploit others to enrich themselves. Where is the progressive side?"
    "People with individual heroism participate in revolutionary work. They are selfish, self-interested, want fame and status, are divorced from the masses, and attack the masses. In short, they bring in many non-proletarian bad things, which have a great destructive effect on revolutionary work."
    "In our work, is there any unconscious new heroism? And are we confusing it with individual heroism and failing to understand it?" This question immediately led the meeting in a new direction.
　　What is New Heroism?
    The chairman said, "Then let's talk about what new heroism is."
    A comrade spoke about the following issue based on his own experience: "When I do a good job and the leadership praises me, I'm often very happy at first, but when I think about whether this happiness is individual heroism, I stop being happy. Is this right?"
    "Your situation cannot be criticized. Who knows what your motivation for being happy is? If you are happy because you have completed the revolutionary task, and because you think about the greatness of the Party's leadership and the power of the masses, then you are not an individual hero, but a new hero. Like the old hero in the opera 'Establishing Merit,' and the old Liang and old Hou in the movie 'The Bridge;' as well as the explosion heroes who hold explosives to blow up enemy bunkers and tanks; and many other combat heroes and river-crossing heroes, who forget everything about themselves for the interests of the people, aren't they all new heroes?"
    "I am convinced that only those who fight for great ideals and noble political goals deserve to be called revolutionary heroes. The historical era of individual heroism has passed. Today, in the era of proletarian revolution, only those who fight for the proletarian revolutionary cause deserve to be called heroes..."
　　How to Establish New Heroism?
    The question turned to "How to overcome individual heroism? How to establish new heroism?" Finally, the problem was solved by the summary made by the presidium and the discussion ended. The summary was:
    "Individual heroism is a characteristic of the exploiting classes. It once played a certain limited progressive role in history. In certain classes today, it may also have a little progressive role, but in our proletarian ranks, especially within our Party, it is very harmful. Because it considers all issues from an individual perspective. It believes that history is created by a few heroes. Therefore, in its work, it overestimates the power of the individual, and values the individual's position and fame. In terms of organizational relationships, it often creates independence from superiors, and bureaucratic styles to subordinates. In terms of learning, it is ambitious and unrealistic, fantasizing about becoming some kind of 'expert' in the future. In terms of life, it is incompatible with the masses. It despises the masses, and the masses also despise it, becoming a 'lone wolf'. It does not know the difference between revolutionary interests and counter-revolutionary interests, so at its most serious, it becomes a traitor like Zhang Guotao! Comrades have realized the destructive nature of individual heroism, and we must thoroughly eliminate it!
    New heroism is mass heroism, and it is a part of proletarian thought. New heroes understand that history is created by the masses, and that only when their actions conform to the laws of social development and fight for the interests of the masses can their actions be considered heroic. They see revolutionary interests as higher than everything else, they have a high sense of responsibility for the revolutionary cause, and they are full of the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people and relying on the people. Therefore, they can not only endure hardship before others and enjoy pleasure after others, bury themselves in hard work, and work hard without complaint, but they are also lively, cheerful, brave, and enterprising. This is our proletarian revolutionary heroism!
    In short, the difference between the two lies in the fact that individual heroes do not have the viewpoints of historical materialism, class, and the masses; while revolutionary heroes have these viewpoints. So basically, it is also the difference between the proletarian revolutionary outlook on life and the non-proletarian outlook on life.
    If the proletariat wants to accomplish the great revolutionary cause and do its work well, it must rely on firm confidence and cheerful, enthusiastic, and brave new heroism. Without this new heroism, many of our difficulties cannot be overcome. The success of socialist construction in the Soviet Union depended on it. Doesn't our new democratic construction also need to rely on it? This point has been confirmed by the many great achievements created by the workers and emancipated peasants after liberation.
    Think about it, why is our school's work not going well? We have not concentrated our efforts, encouraged each other, and brought into play the spirit of new heroism, which is probably a major reason. Today, in the Party training class, our main task is to study, but some comrades are not studying actively, and we should review this.
    Comrades! Let us combine our studies, actively and diligently establish a revolutionary outlook on life, put revolutionary interests first, and cultivate a spirit of fearlessness at all times and in all places, whether in work, study, or life, and promote our new heroism!"

### 个人英雄主义与革命英雄主义——记北平市市委党训班第一支部学习讨论会

　　个人英雄主义与革命英雄主义
    ——记北平市市委党训班第一支部学习讨论会
    编者按：这一对个人英雄主义与革命英雄主义的讨论，在方法上已能密切地联系实际，进行分析批判。但从大家所列举的许多事实中，是否真正划清了界线，明确了观点，以及其所得出的结论是否已经完全正确？尚望大家能进一步从自己实际的体验中提到理论原则，并能追根求源得出克服个人英雄主义建立革命英雄主义的基本办法来。
　　个人英雄主义有没有进步作用？
    “主席！”一位同志发言了：“先让我说一件事情。解放以前，我在清华大学‘北平学生’（清华学生刊物）工作。为了商讨停刊和结帐的事情，需要一个人进城，并且还要带几十封给各地学校地下通讯组的信件到城里发。那时候非常紧张，城门口检查，骑河楼时常有突击检查，带着这些东西是非常危险的。可是，我向组织要求了这个任务。当时我怎样想呢？我看到被捕释放回来的同志，在同学中间是那样光荣；听着他们讲英勇斗争的经过，多么令人羡慕。这一次不正是我表现英勇的好机会吗？所以我不但不怕，甚至希望来一个突击检查。但偏没有，我是平安地完成了任务。这样，请同志们想一想，个人英雄主义不是对革命工作也有好处吗？”
    人们大不以为然，举了很多因为个人英雄主义造成对革命工作严重损失的例子来反对他，并指出：“就以那位在‘北平学生’工作的同志来说吧，他的一时涌现的个人英雄主义，不但对革命工作没有利，反而有害呢！他希望一个突击检查，这样他对自己的任务就要疏忽，不会想尽一切办法来对付敌人，躲避敌人；亏得那次没有碰上检查，如果真碰上，我们想想将要对革命工作带来多大的损害啊！几十个学校的组织关系要被特务警察们发现，他也可能被捕，这样我们能说个人英雄主义对革命有利吗？”
    “我认为个人英雄主义是两个东西加起来的：一个东西是个人主义，一个东西是英雄主义。这里边个人英雄主义是有害的一面，因为他不认识革命的规律，考虑什么事情都是从个人出发；相反的，为革命而努力的是英雄主义，这是进步的一面。我们应该抛掉个人主义，发扬英雄主义。”一位同志提了这样一个很引人注意的意见。
    “你这样说要引起人们思想上的混乱。个人英雄主义是一定阶级的东西，经你这样一分，还有没有它的阶级性呢？你所表扬的英雄主义又是属于那一个阶级的？”
    “个人英雄主义是剥削阶级的东西。个人英雄主义者剥削旁人肥自己，那里有进步的一面？”
    “有个人英雄主义的人参加了革命工作，他自私，自利，要名誉，要地位，脱离群众，打击群众；总之，把许许多多非无产阶级的坏东西带进来，对革命工作起着很大的破坏作用。”
    “我们在工作中是不是有不自觉的新英雄主义呢？而我们是不是把它和个人英雄主义混淆起来搞不清楚了呢？”这个问题一提出来，立刻把会议引到一个新的方向。
　　什么是新英雄主义？
    主席说：“那么我们就谈谈什么是新英雄主义吧。”
    一位同志根据自己的经验讲了这样一个问题：“当我做好一件工作，上级夸奖我的时候，开始常常很高兴，但一想到这种高兴是不是个人英雄主义呢？于是就不再高兴了。这样对不对呢？”
    “你的情形不能加以批判，谁知道你高兴的动机是什么呢？假如你是因为想到完成了革命任务，想到党的领导和群众力量的伟大，那你就不是个人英雄主义，而是新英雄主义。象歌剧‘立功’中的老英雄，电影‘桥’中的老梁、老侯；以及抱着炸药炸毁敌人堡垒、坦克车的爆炸英雄；还有许许多多的战斗英雄，渡江英雄，为了人民的利益，忘记了自己的一切，不都是新英雄主义者吗？”
    “我确信只有为伟大的理想和高尚的政治目标而奋斗的人，才配称得起是革命英雄主义者。个人英雄主义的历史时代已经过去了，在今天，无产阶级革命的时代，只有为无产阶级的革命事业而奋斗的人才配称为英雄。……”
　　怎样建立新英雄主义？
    问题又转到“怎样克服个人英雄主义？怎样建立新英雄主义？”最后在主席团作的总结中解答了这个问题也结束了这次讨论。总结是：
    “个人英雄主义是剥削阶级的特性，它在历史上曾经起过一定的有限的进步作用，在今天某些阶级里，也可能有一点点进步作用，但在我们无产阶级的队伍里，特别是我们党内，却是非常有害的。因为他考虑一切问题，都是从个人出发。他认为历史是少数英雄创造的，因此，他在工作中过高估计个人的力量，重视个人的地位和名利；表现在组织关系方面，往往对上级闹独立性，对下级官僚作风；表现在学习上是好高鹜远，不切实际，幻想自己将来成个什么‘家’；表现在生活方面是和群众格格不入，他瞧不起群众，群众也瞧不起他，变成‘孤家寡人’。他不知道革命利益与反革命利益的区别，因此发展到最严重的时候，就成为象张国焘那样的叛变分子！同志们已经体会到个人英雄主义的破坏性了，我们必须澈底扫除它！
    新英雄主义是群众英雄主义，是无产阶级思想的一部分。新英雄主义者明白历史是群众创造的，只有他适合了社会发展的规律，为群众的利益而奋斗时，他的行为才算是英雄行为。他看革命利益高于一切，他对革命事业有高度的责任心，他充满着全心全意为人民服务和依靠人民的思想。因此，他不但能做到吃苦在先，享乐在后，埋头苦干，任劳任怨，而且是活泼、愉快、勇敢、进取，这就是我们无产阶级的革命英雄主义！
    总之，两者的区别就在于个人英雄主义者没有历史唯物主义的观点、阶级观点和群众观点；而革命英雄主义者则有这些观点。所以基本上也就是无产阶级的革命人生观和非无产阶级的人生观的区别。
    无产阶级要完成伟大的革命事业，要把工作做好，就要靠坚定的信心和愉快、热情、勇敢的新英雄主义，如果没有这种新英雄主义，我们的许多困难就不能克服。苏联社会主义建设的成功是依靠了它，我们新民主主义的建设不也要依靠它吗？这一点已经被解放后的工人和翻身农民所创造的许多伟绩证实了。
    想一想，我们学校的工作为什么搞不好呢？我们没有集中精力，互相鼓励，发挥新英雄主义的精神，恐怕是一个主要原因。今天在党训班，我们主要的任务是学习，但同志们中间还有学习不积极，我们应该检讨一下了。
    同志们！让我们结合着自己的学习，积极努力建立革命人生观，把革命利益放在第一位，无论在工作、学习或生活中，随时随地培养大无畏的精神，发扬我们的新英雄主义！”
