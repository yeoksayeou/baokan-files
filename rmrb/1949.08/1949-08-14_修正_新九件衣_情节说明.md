    Revisions to the Plot of "The New Nine Garments"

    The *Pihuang* opera script "Nine Garments" compiled by Cui Mu has been performed at the Qingfeng Theater in Zhangjiakou with great success. The Jiefang Theater has adapted it into a Shanxi *Bangzi* opera. Because the Shanxi *Bangzi* already has a play called "Nine Garments" (also known as "Biography of a Virtuous Woman"), this play was renamed "The New Nine Garments." "The New Nine Garments" has been performed more than ten times, and the general audience believes that the Shanxi *Bangzi* version is more intense and moving than the *Pihuang* version. In the adaptation, in addition to the necessary modifications to the lyrics to suit the *Bangzi* form, significant changes were also made to the plot. The main changes are as follows:

    (1) The plot of the hired hand being expelled and stealing the wedding dress was removed. Instead, it was changed to the landlord's dissolute son wanting to seize the wife of tenant farmer Shen Dacheng, Shen Niang. The steward, Hua Er, devised a plan to steal the dress and frame Shen Dacheng. This modification was made because: First, audiences with a poor understanding, accustomed to viewing it as a detective story, felt that Shen Dacheng was wronged after watching the original play and that the stealing hired hand should be caught to avenge him. Second, audiences with a better understanding felt that it was unrealistic for a hired hand to steal things after being expelled, which had a negative impact. Third, it deepened the audience's hatred for the landlord and bully.

    (2) The plot of Hua Er chasing Zhao Da and Li Zicheng's rebel army suddenly appearing at a critical moment was removed. Instead, it was changed to Zhao Da seeking refuge with the rebel army to complain about his grievances. The rebel army then mobilized, captured the county magistrate, raided the Hua mansion, and rescued the people. This modification was made because the original plot made people feel that the rebel army descended from the sky and was forced into the plot, failing to fully express the people's true emotions of longing for and relying on the rebel army.

    (3) The original play's division into scenes was abandoned, and the old continuous form of each scene was adopted. This modification was made because: First, the Jiefang Theater did not have the equipment for painted backdrops. Second, in order to maximize the strengths of Shanxi *Bangzi*, it was felt that developing in the direction of painted backdrops would actually affect the high-pitched,激越激越(jī yuè - impassioned and vehement), intense, and fiery movement rules of Shanxi *Bangzi*.

    (4) The specially made rebel army song at the end of the play was abandoned and replaced with the Shanxi *Yangge* "Big Vegetable Picking" tune. This modification was made because: First, using Shanxi *Yangge* to accompany Shanxi *Bangzi* made the overall musical structure of the opera more harmonious. Second, the use of a *Yangge* dance form at the end was more in line with national sentiment and made the scene more lively and active than a standing chorus.

    Attached: Lyrics of the ending "Big Vegetable Picking" song are as follows:
  (1)
	Parting (this) dark cloud sees clear (咿么) sky, (hum ah),
	Beat to death the tyrant and dog official.
	Revenge is taken, grievance is cleared;
	Want to divide the grain, want to divide the money; (Ah la hum ah),
	From now on, everyone will have a good and peaceful year. (Interlude)
	(Ah la hum ah) From now on, everyone will have a good and peaceful year.
  (2)
	Chuang Wang's (the rebel) army saved (咿么) us, (hum ah),
	Help Chuang Wang fight for the country.
	Those who killed, paid with their lives;
	Those who owed debts, returned the money; (Ah la hum ah),
	Li Chuang Wang sits on the throne as stable as Mount Tai. (Interlude)
	(Ah la hum ah) Li Chuang Wang sits on the throne as stable as Mount Tai.
	One Nine Four Nine, Zhangjiakou.

### 修正“新九件衣”情节说明

    修正“新九件衣”情节说明
    崔牧所编“九件衣”皮黄剧本，已在张家口市庆丰戏院上演过，效果很好。解放戏院把它改成山西梆子上演。因山西梆子原有“九件衣”（又名“烈女传”）一剧，故将此剧改称“新九件衣”。“新九件衣”已演出十余次，一般观众均认为此剧用山西梆子形式演出，较用皮黄形式，更为紧张动人。在改排中，除了唱白词句方面，为了适应梆子形式，作了必要的修改外；在情节方面，也作了不少修改。主要的，有以下几点：
    （一）取消长工被逐，盗取嫁衣的情节，改为地主花花太岁意欲霸占佃户申大成之妻申娘，特由管家花二定下盗衣之计，陷害申大成。这样修改，是因为：第一、一般认识较差，习惯于公案故事看法的观众，看了原剧后，认为申大成冤枉，应该捉拿盗衣长工，来替他报仇雪恨。第二、一般认识较好的观众，认为长工被逐，就要偷东西，不合实际，影响不好。第三、加深观众对地主恶霸的仇恨。
    （二）取消花二追赵大，在紧要关头，李自成民军突然出现的情节，改为赵大投奔民军诉冤，民军出动，捉县官，抄花府，解救百姓。这样修改，是因为原剧情节，使人感觉民军从天而降，是硬凑上的，不能充分表现百姓向往民军，依靠民军的真实情绪。
    （三）取消原剧采取分幕形式，改用各场连续的旧形式。这样修改，是因为：第一、解放戏院没有彩头布景那种设备。第二、为了尽量发展山西梆子的长处，感觉若向彩头布景方面发展，反足影响山西梆子高亢激越，紧张火炽的运动规律。
    （四）剧终大团场，原有特制民军歌曲，弃而未用，改用山西秧歌“大挑菜”调子。这样修改，是因为：第一、用山西秧歌配合山西梆子，全歌剧在旋律结构上，较为和谐。第二、终场用秧歌舞形式，比用站队齐唱形式更合民族情趣，场面更为生动活跃。
    附：终场“大挑菜”歌词如下：
  （一）
     拨开（这）乌云见青（咿么）天呀，（哼唉），
     打死恶霸和狗官。
     报了仇，雪了冤；
     要分粮，要分钱；（唉啦哼唉），
     从今后大家好过太平年。（过门）
     （唉啦哼唉）从今后大家好过太平年。
  （二）
     闯王（的）民军救了（咿么）咱呀，（哼唉），
     帮助闯王打江山。
     杀人的，偿了命；
     欠债的，还了钱；（唉啦哼唉），
     李闯王坐天下稳如泰山。（过门）
     （唉啦哼唉）李闯王坐天下稳如泰山。
            一九四九，张家口。
