　　Private Middle School Tuition Issues
　　Education Bureau Holds Symposium to Discuss Solutions
	Increasing Self-Study Time to Strengthen Chinese Language Education

　　[Report from this newspaper] In order to reasonably resolve the tuition fees and curriculum reform issues of private middle schools in the city, the Education Bureau convened a symposium on the 22nd in the auditorium of Yiwen Middle School, gathering over a hundred representatives from the Education Union, Student Union, private middle school principals, teaching directors, and student representatives.

　　According to information gathered at the meeting, the tuition fee issues of most private middle schools have been resolved through democratic consultation. Responsible persons from schools such as Da Zhong, Xin Sheng, and Song Yun reported on the process and experience of resolving tuition fee issues. Representatives from Jinshan Vocational School and Chengda Middle School explained the difficulties in resolving the issues. Subsequently, Gu Qizong, Chairman of the Student Union, reported the Student Union's suggestions for resolving the tuition fee issues: hoping that the school, faculty, and students would jointly organize a unified institution, based on the principles of unity, cooperation, and consultation, to resolve the issues; and hoping that this institution would lay the foundation for democratic management of the school in the future. He also proposed: (1) Hoping that schools would appropriately relax or increase the number of reduction and exemption places, to take care of students from poor families with good academic standing who are willing to serve the people. (2) Hoping that schools would streamline and save, reduce expenses, and determine tuition fee amounts based on their income. (3) Students must pay tuition fees to attend school, but for those who have difficulty raising the full amount at once, it is hoped that the school will allow payment in installments, provided that the parents or other parties have provided a guarantee. Finally, Vice Director Hou Junyan, the chairman, summarized everyone's opinions and proposed the direction for resolving the tuition fee issues: (1) The school, faculty, and students should unite as one to run the school well. (2) To solve the school's financial difficulties, the school should streamline and save, reduce unnecessary staff, and the responsible persons should personally take action and mobilize everyone to work together to solve some of the difficulties in school repairs and purchases. (3) Democratic consultation, discussion, understanding of the situation, and open and honest methods should be adopted in handling the issues. It is hoped that schools that have not yet resolved the issues will resolve them on their own in this spirit.

　　Next, Vice Director Hou explained that the number of class hours per week varied greatly among schools last semester, with some reaching as high as 35 or 36 hours. Students had almost no time for self-study and review outside of class. According to the opinions of most teachers and the reflections of students, the Education Bureau, with reference to the decision of the North China Ministry of Education and the provisions of the old curriculum standards, has formulated a temporary curriculum, appropriately reducing the number of foreign language class hours and canceling the labor practice subject, reducing the number of class hours per week to between 30 and 32 hours. This will give students two to three hours of self-study time each day. He emphasized that schools should pay special attention to Chinese language. He said: "It is a big problem if Chinese people do not understand their own culture. Therefore, the Chinese language course should be set at six hours for both junior and senior high schools." He also said: "For the needs of future social development and for the future national construction, it is hoped that schools will add Russian language courses. However, when various conditions (such as teachers and textbooks) are not universally available, Russian and English can be freely chosen by students, especially high school students who have already laid the foundation in English, it is hoped that they will not give up halfway. As for the learning hours, it is tentatively set at three hours per week for junior high school and four hours per week for senior high school. Those who wish to further study foreign languages can also strengthen their personal self-study outside of the prescribed hours. As for subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, there is currently no need to change them, and they will still be taught according to the original hours."

　　Secondly, he said that each school should jointly establish a school affairs committee composed of representatives from the school, faculty, and students. Under the leadership of the principal, the committee will discuss and decide on major school matters in a democratic centralism manner, in order to run the school well. Finally, he proposed that each school should promptly re-register with the Education Bureau for review; if the board of directors of each school is not sound, it should be quickly formed and submitted to the Education Bureau for review.

　　私立中学学费问题
  　教局召开座谈会商讨解决
    增加自习时间加强国文教育
    【本报讯】教育局为合理解决本市各私立中学学费与课程改革问题，于二十二日在艺文中学大礼堂召集教联、学联代表和各私立中学校校长、教导主任、学生会代表等百余人举行座谈会。
    据会上了解，大部分私立中学的学费问题，经过民主协商已获解决，并有大中、新生、嵩云等校负责人在会上报告了解决学费问题的经过和经验。另有进山高商、成达中学等校方则叙说了不能解决问题的困难。继由学联主席古奇踪报告学联对解决学费问题的建议：希望校方、教职员和学生共同组织一个统一的机构，本着团结、合作、协商的原则来解决问题；并希望今后以此机构奠定学校民主管理的基础。他同时提出：（一）希望各校把减费生和免费生的标准在可能条件下适当放宽，或增加名额，以照顾家境清寒、品学兼优，愿意为人民服务的同学。（二）希望各校精简节约，减少开支；量出为人订定学费数目。（三）同学上学一定要缴纳学费，但对一时难以全部筹出的，希望校方在家长或其他方面已提出保证下允许分期缴费。最后，主席侯俊岩副局长把大家意见初步归纳，提出解决学费问题的方向：（一）校方、教职员、学生应团结一致，以期办好学校。（二）解决学校经费的困难校方应精简节约，不必要的冗员予以裁减，负责人并应亲自动手，发动大家共同劳动，解决学校修理、购买方面的某些困难。（三）在问题的处理上要采取民主协议，大家讨论，了解情况，开诚布公的办法。希望尚未解决问题的学校本此精神自行解决。
    接着，侯副局长说明上学期各校每周上课时数极不一致，最高有达三十五、六小时的，学生除上课外，几乎没有自习和温课的时间，根据大多数教员的意见和学生的反映，教局参照华北教育部的决定和旧课程标准的规定，已订出暂时课程表，适当地减少了外国文钟点和取消了劳作一科，每周时数减少到三十小时至三十二小时之间。这样学生每天可有二至三小时的自习时间。他着重提出各校应特别注意国文。他说：中国人对本国的文化都搞不通，真是大问题，所以国文课程初高中都应定为六小时。他又说：为了将来社会发展的需要和为了将来国家各项建设，希望各校增设俄文，但在目前各种条件（如师资、课本）未能普遍具备时，俄文、英文可由学生自由选择，尤以高中学生，已打下英文基础的，希望他们勿半途而废。至于学习时数暂定为初中每周三小时，高中每周为四小时，对外国语愿进一步研究者，亦可于规定时数外加强个人自习。至于数学、物理、化学、生物等科目，目前可以不必更改，仍照原来时数讲授。
    其次，他说到各校应由校方、教职员、学生等代表联合成立校务委员会，在校长领导下以民主集中制的方法讨论决定学校各项重大事项，来把学校办好。最后，他提出各学校应迅速至教局进行重行登记，以便审查；各校如校董会不健全者，应迅速组成，以呈报教育局审核。  　（潘蓝）
