Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 5th: TASS News: The Tajik Republic was originally a very backward area before the revolution. Socialism has not only brought it economic prosperity but also a high level of culture. The Voroshilov Farm in Leninabad Oblast is a vivid example. Most of the farmers in this collective farm have received seven years of education, and the farm managers are all graduates of secondary schools. Many sons and daughters of collective farmers have graduated from universities, and some have returned to their hometown collective farms to work as teachers and agronomists. This collective farm is expected to have an income of 20 million rubles this year. The collective farmers have decided to allocate a huge sum of 5 million rubles to build a magnificent collective farm cultural palace. The central building of this cultural palace will include a library with a collection of 100,000 volumes, a reading room for 150 people, and a lecture hall and theater for 700 people. Surrounding the central building will be a natural science exhibition hall, an agricultural laboratory, a conference hall, a gymnasium, a club, and a children's room. All the buildings of the cultural palace will be built with locally produced marble and granite. Lawns and gardens will also be developed around it. The cultural palace will be built on a scenic hilltop overlooking the Syr Darya River basin and the beautiful scenery of the snow-covered Turkestan and Altai mountain peaks.

    苏联农民文化水平怎样？
    伏罗希洛夫农场提供了一个生动的例子
    【新华社北平五日电】塔斯社讯：塔吉克共和国在革命前原是十分落后的地区，社会主义不仅给它带来了经济上的富裕，而且也带来了高度的文化。列宁阿巴德州的伏罗希洛夫农场就是一个生动的例子。这个集体农场的农民大部分都已受了七年教育，农场管理人员都是中等学校毕业的。有许多集体农民的儿女，都从高等学校毕业，有些已回到他们家乡的集体农场，作着教师和农业家的工作。该集体农场今年预计将有二千万卢布的收入。集体农民们已决议拨出五百万卢布的巨款，建筑一座宏大富丽的集体农场文化宫。这个文化宫的中央建筑物，将包括藏书十万卷的图书馆、容纳一百五十人的阅览室，和容纳七百人的讲演厅和剧院。中央建筑物的四周，将是自然科学陈列馆、农业试验室、会议厅、健身房、俱乐部和儿童室。文化宫的全部房屋将以当地出产的大理石和花岗石建筑。它的周围并将开辟草地和花园。文化宫将建筑在一座风景秀丽的山顶上，可以了望锡尔——达利亚河流域，和常年盖雪的土耳其斯坦及阿尔泰山山峰所呈现的优美风景。
