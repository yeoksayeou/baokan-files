(Shandong News) After studying the Xinhua News Agency's short commentary "Protect the Property of the People's Motherland," the Taishan Prefecture in Central and Southern Shandong Province initially identified the following serious problems: (1) In grain work, the exact figures for existing grain in various counties are unavailable, and phenomena such as grain worms, theft, and unauthorized selling or lending occur frequently. A grain worker in Zhangqiu lost 1.98 million yuan with no whereabouts discovered. Some grain cadres use flour sacks as bundles and bedsheets. (2) In financial work, supervision over tax collection is not strict, and tax evasion is rampant. In particular, tax cadres lose their position and collude with merchants to sell tax invoices for personal gain by taking advantage of the opportunity to increase tax rates. Wei Zhongjie in Laiwu embezzled 710,000 yuan in tax money. (3) In trade work, accounting shortages occur constantly. The business transportation department and the cooperative have discrepancies of over 10,000 jin in soybean cake accounts, 4,000 jin of millet, and 2,000 jin of hemp with no records. Material losses and grain spillage also occur frequently. (4) In banking work, moldy and rotten grain loans are found; over 200 jin of moldy and rotten soybeans were found in Zhao Village District, Tai'an. The warehouse in Licheng was robbed. There was a shortage of 200,000 yuan in Tai'an. The main reasons for this serious damage to state property are, first, the leadership: (1) Lax inspections of financial and economic work lead to negligence. (2) The reporting system is not strict, and reports focus only on the good aspects, not the shortcomings. (3) A lenient attitude is taken towards cadres who endanger policies, engage in corruption, and waste resources, and they are not dealt with promptly or severely. (4) The leadership's thinking is paralyzed, believing that all cadres would not make mistakes after the "Three Checks and Three Rectifications" campaign, thus relaxing ideological leadership and education for cadres. Currently, in addition to the leadership making self-criticisms, methods for correction and overcoming these problems have been formulated.

　　泰山专署学习新华社短评
    检查财经工作
  　发现不少损害国家财产现象
    领导上已作检讨订定办法纠正
    【山东讯】鲁中南泰山专署学习了新华社“保护人民祖国财产”的短评后，初步检查出以下严重问题：（一）粮食工作上，各县现粮无精确的数字，麦粮生虫和被偷窃盗及卖、借等现象迭出。章邱粮务员丢掉一百九十八万元未找出下落。粮食干部有的用面袋作包袱，作被单等。（二）财政工作上，对税收工作掌握不严，漏税偷税现象严重，特别税收干部丧失立场，利用提高税率机会勾结商人出卖税票从中贪污，莱芜魏中节贪污税款人民币七十一万元。（三）贸易工作，会计短款掉不断发生，业务保运课与合作社差豆饼帐一万余斤，谷子四千斤，运麻数二千斤无帐。对物资损失，粮食撒泼现象也时常发生。（四）银行工作，霉烂贷粮，泰安赵庄区霉烂贷粮豆子二百余斤。历城仓库被偷。泰安短款二十万元。造成这种严重损害国家财产的主要原因，首先是领导上：（一）对财经工作检查不严格放任自流。（二）报告制度不严格，而报告也是光报好不报告缺点。（三）对危害政策及贪污浪费的干部采取姑息态度，不及时处理或处理不严。（四）领导思想麻痹，认为三查三整后所有干部便都不会犯错了，而放松了对干部思想领导和教育，现除领导上已作检讨外，并作出了纠正与克服的办法。
