    Soviet Union: Pei Huofusiqi
　　I. The Reactionary Mask
    Imperialism has brought countless disasters to humanity. In the past thirty years, imperialists have subjected the world to two terrible, devastating wars. Imperialism—this is synonymous with international plunder, economic chaos, poverty, suffering, and death for millions of people. Imperialism stifles freedom, hinders cultural progress, and poisons the world with the stench of moral decline and ideological degeneration.

    The parasitic imperialist bourgeoisie, in order to maintain its regime, widely abuses various means to influence the consciousness of people in various countries ideologically. The corrupt capitalist ideology manufactured by their hired lackeys attempts, on the one hand, to cultivate some lawless imperialist mercenaries, and on the other hand, tries by any means to deceive the masses—they promote extremely reactionary theories, pornographic literature, and malicious counter-propaganda in the form of "sociological doctrines," "works of art," and "philosophical systems."

    In the reactionary philosophy market, there are dozens of stalls with bizarre signs, loudly soliciting civilians from countries like the United States, Britain, and France. Although these bourgeois professors, doctors, and hack writers vary in style and have different tricks, they create the same ugly thing—using the poison of mystery and superstition to harm people's minds.

    The corrupt philosophy of militant imperialism is thoroughly fictitious and deceptive, which can be seen from the names of those philosophical factions—the various trademarks affixed to corrupt ideological commodities: anti-empirical "Empiricism," anti-rational "Rationalism," "Positivism" that hates all genuine achievements in science, "Pragmatism" that mocks the results of social practice, "Realism" that distorts reality, "Criticism" that defends double-dealing "Dogmatism," and many other schools that often like to put a "New" (Neo-) in front of their names, but they bring to the world only the oldest metaphysical garbage.

    "Individualism" philosophy is also one of the masks that modern reactionaries and imperialist running dogs put on their heads. Reactionary lackeys appearing in the guise of "philosophers" spare no effort to oppose the progressive, innovative democratic ideas and noble, freedom-loving aspirations of all nations.

    American "Individualism" is one of the modern reactionary philosophical trends with great influence. Its adherents openly appear as the sworn enemies of the scientific materialist worldview, and they call for a crusade against progressive ideas and theories.

    The shamelessness of reactionary thinkers is by no means proof that they have strengthened their positions in the struggle between the two camps, nor is it the result of the consolidation of idealist philosophy. On the contrary, their ruthlessness is a product of powerlessness, a manifestation of desperate resistance due to the unstoppable growth and strengthening of the progressive ideological and political forces opposed to them. The unstoppable growth of revolutionary democratic forces and ideas increasingly shakes the system that hates human capitalism exploitation and imperialist plunder, thus driving the defenders of this system crazy. The achievements and gains of scientific thought provide new and more evidence for the truth and richness of dialectical materialism, taking down the positions of idealists one by one. The "attack" of the reactionaries who have been driven to a dead end is because they have nowhere to retreat; their arrogance and cynicism have reached their peak because they have nothing left to lose. Now the crusade of imperialist thinkers against progressive creative thought—is the brutal manifestation of people whose fate has been sealed, a spasmodic conspiracy to try to turn back the wheel of history.

    In order to explain the essence of American Individualism philosophy, it is not necessary to prove its inherent idealism and fideism components. Individualist philosophers appear as open advocates of idealism and clericalism, and they do not hide their hostility towards materialist philosophy. They frankly declare that their worldview is of a religious, mystical nature.

    "What is the secret of the universe?"—Ralph T. Flewelling, the leader of American Individualism and professor at the University of Southern California, asks and answers: "It is that matter itself exists by virtue of the constant, purposeful will of a supreme power, and the relationships that now exist and the personalities that grasp these relationships are all created by this power. Behind this inscrutable power—is God, the highest personality, the true secret of the world order." W.E. Hocking, one of the most powerful idealist representatives in the United States and professor at Harvard University, echoes Flewelling's words: "Idealism is… my metaphysical center… I say: the world is the subjective self (Self)… The meaning of all things is combined in a unified will… I believe in mystical realism, which is the only acceptable kind of realism."

    The religious idealist Individualism philosophy does not hide its hatred for the materialist worldview. Its foundation is: deliberately and premeditatedly falsifying the conclusions of modern natural science, using sophistry and lies when criticizing the scientific materialist worldview, and defending Protestant dogmas. The methods they use to oppose materialism are deception, falsification, distortion, and slander. They use this method when commenting on socio-political issues. Individualism, under the guise of hypocritical and dogmatic platitudes about social progress and democracy, wages a tenacious struggle against genuine social progress and genuine democracy, and protects the interests of the anti-people American imperialism.
　　II. The Essence of Individualism
    The word "Individualism" comes from the word "Person" (Latin "Persona"). "Individualism" means "philosophy of personality." Appearing under this name is straight-line Spiritualism, a militant idealism in open religious form. Individualism is a form of objective idealism that occupies a dominant position in bourgeois philosophy in the United States today. This form is most popular among reactionary Protestant classes. The characteristic of this objective idealism variant is its Pluralism: Individualism believes that a unified spirit cannot satisfy it, it adds many spirits to the world, adding a large number of spiritual entities. The prototype of Individualism is Leibniz's Monadology—an idealist fantasy, as if the world is composed of many spiritual elements, Monads, centers of spiritual activity.

    Professor E.S. Brightman of Boston University gave the following definition of Individualism: "Individualism is a belief that the universe is a composite of many conscious entities, the ability (Energy) described by physicists is the will of God in action, and unconscious and impersonal life does not exist. All that exists is conscious spirit or some stage or aspect of conscious spirit." Therefore, according to this, the basic question of philosophy about the relationship between nature and spirit, life and thought, is, in the eyes of Individualists, in the form of the question about the relationship between nature and "personality" (which appears as a synonym for spirit and consciousness). "Nature itself," Brightman writes, "is the experience and expression of the ability of personality, and personality is greater than nature." "The only kind of entire reality is the consciousness of personality."

    Individualism believes that the world is derived from consciousness, so as a result, it replaces the objective laws in nature and society with indeterminism and causality—Teleology. The purpose and will of "God's personality" become the basic principle of the structure of the world, replacing the scientific principles of regular, causally related movement and development.

    The speculation of the purely fictional concept of "personality" serves as a basic tool for Individualists to fabricate anti-scientific conclusions and conduct social counter-propaganda. Individualists stubbornly believe that personality is the highest reality, the ultimate reality, and the highest value. Therefore, the "personality" of Individualism certainly has nothing in common with the personality that exists in reality. In the eyes of Individualism, personality is identical to consciousness. "Personality," according to Brightman's definition, "is the unity of complex changes in consciousness." In their view, personality is the non-material basis, the source of spiritual ability.

    They push the concept of personality, which is distorted and understood by Individualism, to the forefront in philosophy, wanting to kill two birds with one stone. Because "personality" appears as a metaphysical central concept, as the opposite of object, object, and natural phenomena, this concept is used by Individualism to fight against the basic principles of natural science thought. Because "personality" appears as a basic socio-historical concept, as the "ultimate value" and "highest purpose" of civilization, this concept is used to fight against scientific methods and progressive socio-political tendencies in social science.

    No matter how Individualists quibble, they are always unable to hide the fact that their doctrine is a replica of bourgeois individualism, bourgeois "personality" worship. The emergence of Marxism indicates the complete theoretical bankruptcy of the bourgeois individualist worldview. The new socialist world, growing and strengthening in the struggle against exploitation and violence, has irrefutably proved in practice that the all-round development of personality and its freedom and happiness can only be achieved on the basis of socialist forms of life and labor, only on the soil of the moral and political unity of the people who have been freed from the capitalist servitude and the corrupting influence of bourgeois individualism praised by the Individualists who defend capitalism.

    Because "personality" is reduced to consciousness by Individualists, and consciousness is reduced to "free will," therefore, in the eyes of this reactionary philosophy, the entire nature is a "kingdom of purposes," a "kingdom of universal freedom," where invisible "personalities" are hidden behind all objects and processes. The anthropomorphism of this "modern" philosophy is so obvious that the Individualists themselves do not want to deny this point and admit that they "cannot avoid being condemned as anthropomorphic."

    Individualists try to compete with those reactionary "Philosophia Perennis"—that is, "Eternal Philosophy"—that eulogizes and dazzles its ancient Catholic Neo-Scholastics, they prove that their reactionary nature is even older, and their reactionary nature, as Flewelling said with comic confidence, can be traced back to Heraclitus and Anaxagoras. Since it has reproduced the ignorant anthropomorphic concept of primitive savages in the twentieth century—what could be older than it! These primitive savages gave souls, consciousness, and wills to all objects and elements around them according to their own image and likeness, the only difference is that the souls that savages gave to trees, stones, rivers, and mountains are much purer than the souls of American conservative professors.

    It must be fairly admitted that these gentlemen are very thorough in promoting anthropomorphism, they not only use it on natural phenomena, but also on the head of God. One of the basic motives of idealism that they take the form of Individualism instead of other forms is that Individualism is adapted to the orthodox Christian dogma—Theism. Theism is a religious belief that God is anthropomorphic, God is a special, high-level "personality" with reason and will, and man is created according to God's "image and likeness." Theism is the anthropomorphic concept of God—that is, a superstitious concept, which in the religious fantasy of man replaced the concept of Zoomorphism that existed before it, which manifested God in the image of birds and beasts. Individualists use their entire philosophy entirely to defend this stale religious dogma.

    Individualists vehemently oppose pragmatism verbally, and swear allegiance to experimental science step by step, but in reality, what they regard as their highest scale is the dead religious dogma, and this dogma, even the religious supporters who are a little closer to science themselves, have been embarrassed to propose for three hundred years. "Nature is the expression of God's personality"; "The only entity of nature is God's personality,"—this is the latest masterpiece of bourgeois philosophy three hundred years ago against the then outdated ancient mythology.

    The Individualists' absorption of the personality of God into their own system clearly exposes that the origin, freedom, and independence of the real personalities that constitute human society that they talk about are all fictional and forged. If the entire nature, as they assert, is the expression of God's personality and all "personalities act under the guidance of God," then what is the meaning of all the clamoring that the Individualists put forward against limiting and reducing the freedom and self-determination of "personality"? The Individualists' purpose of talking about "personality" and its "freedom" is only to deprive the true spiritual freedom of real people and make them succumb to the religious dogma used to strengthen the exploitation system. Individualists anti-propaganda criticize absolutism in philosophy, as if to restore the trampled human rights by putting the personality of God—the worst form of dogmatic absolutism—on the throne. They start by supporting sound personality and end by supporting the rest of sound personality. "Only in complete selflessness can personality realize its true self,"—Flewelling said with enchantment. And in order to eradicate all doubts, he said: "The true Individualist will achieve the highest expression of the self, but he achieves this by selflessly serving God..." Flewelling called on people to "become slaves to a force, serving this force is the most perfect freedom."

    Vulgar sophistry cannot conceal the true content of this clericalist preaching. Individualists restrict the philosophy of spiritual freedom and propose the philosophy of spiritual enslavement; they confuse people with the all-round self-development of personality and propose the "selflessness" of personality that slavishly bows down at the feet of the "cosmic autocrat."
　　III. The Base Technique of Stealing the Sky and Changing the Sun
    After reading these militant reactionary declarations, besides contempt, what consequences will the hypocritical assertions of Individualists lead to? As if their philosophy is completely in line with experimental science, as if modern natural science is their loyal ally. They rudely falsify scientific data and try their best to force science to serve its most ferocious enemy—fideism.

    Modern experimental physics, according to Individualists, is incompatible with materialism; they assert that science has proven the "bankruptcy" of the materialist worldview and has experimentally "established" the hypothesis of Individualist idealism.

    "Materialism is dead,"—Hocking concluded his "refutation" of materialism, and then cruelly set about his next "refutation." How strange, how enthusiastically and indignantly they fought with this poor "dead man"! Every time there is a new discovery in physics, materialism gets a new confirmation, and this evidence is increasing, and the power and influence of materialism is also becoming stronger and stronger. Therefore, these Individualists who defend anti-scientific, reactionary idealist ideas have to run wild like this.

    The arguments cited by Individualists to oppose materialism are mostly old idealist dregs. All their arguments are the pitiful old tune of physical idealism, repeating the same topic over and over again: "Matter has disappeared." The Individualists repeatedly sing the hackneyed tune of Machism's disappearance of matter, and they dare not even mention a word about the fact that their unfounded claims have been devastatingly attacked in Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism." They dare not oppose Lenin's arguments. They stubbornly refuse to mention it, pretending that nothing happened. Only in this way, by keeping silent and deceiving, can they regard the victory of materialism as its failure.

    Twentieth-century physics shattered the former metaphysical concept of atoms. It proved the complex and changeable structure of atoms. In front of science, a new field of complex internal atomic regularity was opened up. Atoms have become the object of scientific experimental research that can be analyzed, split, and experimentally studied from rich scientific hypotheses. The hypothesis of the physical structure of matter has given way to the accurate and reliable knowledge of the structure of matter.

    The discovery of atomic physics is a victory for scientific dialectical materialism. This is the philosophical significance of the achievements of twentieth-century physics. Individualists are single-mindedly trying to conceal this self-evident summary of the development of physical science. They follow those pioneers of physical idealism who were exposed by Lenin in those years, and single-mindedly distort the essence of physical discoveries, resorting to all means of rumors and deceptions, stealing the sky and changing the sun—the only purpose is to "destroy" materialism and establish idealism.

    Individualists feel that the principle of the automatic nature of matter has been proven by the latest physics, and it is no longer necessary to use God as a driving force, thus further strengthening the position of atheist materialism, so they assert: "The activity inside cells and atoms is not an argument that can be used to deny the existence of the highest will or God, but a natural evidence that can prove his existence."

    The development of physics, according to Individualists, ended the atoms of matter and restored the status of Leibniz's units. "The seeds of objects" are not tiny material bodies, but the center of force, the origin of automatic force. The activities of these "seeds"—are the expression of the activity of cosmic reason. The source of the ability inside atoms is the will of God.

    At first, Individualists slanderously asserted that materialism understands reality as something dead, dull, and devoid of automatic nature. After they slandered materialist philosophy, they then said triumphantly: The discovery of physics overturned such a view of nature, so the idealism's view of the world as the scope of activity of pure spiritual essence is correct.

    The method of distorting by stealing the sky and changing the sun is the basic method used by Individualists in the anti-materialist struggle. They like to use this method: they regard dialectical materialism and mechanical materialism as the same thing, and then while criticizing the latter, they pretend to be criticizing modern scientific materialism as if their criticism of the outdated form of materialism is criticizing modern scientific materialism.

    Hocking brazenly spread rumors, saying that materialism seemed to be splitting matter, space, and time, making them special essences, without understanding their interdependence. Flewelling echoed, saying that materialism... is defending the principle of continuity and denying the discontinuity in natural development. Individualists tirelessly said that materialism denies the reality of quality and reduces the difference in quality to the difference in quantity; materialism cannot explain change and development, it stands on the position of treating cause and effect equally, and cancels the generation of new factors. And so on.

    All these pitiful slanders of Individualist slanderers will only arouse deep contempt from people, for the simple reason that all their accusations are completely inapplicable to modern scientific materialism, and they cannot harm it at all. All the metaphysical and mechanical viewpoints exposed by Individualists are irrelevant to modern materialism and are unacceptable to it. The metaphysical view of entities, the non-materialist assumption of empty space, reducing qualitative differences to quantitative differences, denying discontinuity, mechanically understanding causality—all of this was overthrown by Marx's materialist philosophy more than a hundred years ago, although there was still a long period of time before the discovery of modern physics, but later these discoveries brilliantly proved the broad vision of the theoretical hypothesis of the founders of Marxism.

    Marx's materialist philosophy has grown and strengthened not only in the struggle against idealism, but also in the struggle against mechanism. Marxism has proved the vitality and richness of materialism, because it has freed scientific thought from the metaphysical and mechanical dogmatism that hindered its development, and opened up infinite prospects for it. Scientifically overthrowing mechanism—is the great historical achievement of Marx's materialist philosophy.

    Marxism criticized mechanism, it criticized mechanism from the left's materialist dialectical standpoint, clericalism criticized mechanism from the right's fideist and reactionary standpoint, but Individualists opposed the latter criticism to the former criticism. They try to regard the historical limitations of mechanism as the bankruptcy of all materialism and the powerlessness of all scientific thought.

    However, it cannot be assumed that Individualists really do not know about the existence of Marx's materialism. Brightman admitted in his book "Nature and Value" that dialectical materialism is superior to previous forms of materialism. "To some extent," Brightman wrote, "modern naturalism has obvious advantages over ancient materialism and even the mechanism and atomism of the nineteenth century... Since the mid-nineteenth century, under the common influence of Darwin, Marx, and the latest physics, materialists have begun to understand that the old fixed atoms are redundant; they have begun to understand the world of ability, the scope of force, and the process of transformation. Materialism has become dialectical materialism, and pays special attention to evolution and activity."

    Individualists know very well that dialectical materialism has eliminated the shortcomings and limitations of mechanical materialism, but in all their works they still equate modern scientific materialism with the old materialism, and describe criticizing mechanism as criticizing Marx's materialist philosophy.

    These deceptive tricks are unique to modern Individualists. They feel that they are completely powerless to oppose dialectical materialism. In order to carry out the orders of their masters, they have to use methods suitable for their character and ability: relying on shameless rumors and well-known fictions.

　　“个性主义”哲学批判
  　现代资产阶级反动哲学批判
    苏联：裴霍夫斯基
　　一、反动的假面具
    帝国主义给人类带来了无数灾难。三十年来，帝国主义者使世界遭遇了两次可怕的、毁灭性的大战。帝国主义——这是国际掠夺、经济混乱、千百万人贫困、苦难和死亡的代名词。帝国主义窒息着自由，阻碍着文化的进展，以道德沦亡和思想堕落的恶臭毒害着世界。
    寄生的帝国主义资产阶级，为了保持自己的政权，广泛地滥用各种手段从思想上去影响各国人民的意识。他们雇佣的奴才所制造的腐败的资本主义意识形态，企图一方面借此来培养一些横行不法的帝国主义佣兵，另一方面想不择手段地来蒙蔽人民群众——他们在“社会学说”、“艺术作品”、“哲学体系”的形式之下宣传着极端反动的理论、色情文学、恶毒的反宣传。
    在反动哲学的市场上有着好几十家戏摊，挂着千奇百怪的招牌，大声疾呼地招徕美英法等国的平民。这些资产阶级的教授、博士、蹩脚作家虽然花色繁多，各有巧妙不同，但是他们所创造的却是同一件丑恶的事情——用神秘和迷信的毒药来残害人们的头脑。
    好战帝国主义的腐化哲学澈头澈尾是虚构的、欺人的，这从那些哲学派别的名称——贴在腐化的思想商品上的五花八门的商标——本身就可以看出来：敌视经验的“经验主义”（Ｅｍｐｉｒｉｃｉｓｍ），违反理性的“理性主义”（Ｒａｔｉｏｎａｌｉｓｍ）憎恨科学中一切真正成果的“实证主义”（Ｐｏｓｉｔｉｖｉｓｍ），讽嘲社会实践结果的“实用主义”（Ｐｒａｇｍａｔｉｓｍ），歪曲现实的“现实主义”（Ｒｅａｌｉｓｍ），替双料的“教条主义”（Ｄｏｇｍａｔｉｓｍ）辩护的“批评主义”（Ｃｒｉｔｉｃｉｓｍ），还有许许多多流派常常喜欢在自己名字的前面题上一个“新”（Ｎｅｏ—）字，但是它们带到世界上来的却都是些旧到不能再旧的形而上学的垃圾。
    “个性主义”哲学也是现代反动派和帝国主义走狗套在自己头上的假面具之一。穿着“哲学家”外衣出现的反动派奴才不择手段地反对各民族前进的、革新的民主思想和高贵的、爱好自由的志向。
    美国“个性主义”是势力很大的现代反动哲学思潮之一。它的皈依者都是公开地以科学的唯物主义世界观的死敌的姿态出现的，他们号召向进步的思想和理论作十字军的进军。
    反动思想家的无耻决不是他们在两个阵营的斗争中增强了阵地的证明，决不是唯心主义哲学巩固的结果。正好相反，他们的残酷是无力的产物，是由于和他们对立的进步思想政治力量难以遏止地日益生长和增强而死命反抗的表现。革命民主力量和思想的难以遏止的生长，越来越震动那憎恨人类的资本主义剥削和帝国主义掠夺的制度，因此使这种制度的辩护人疯狂了。科学思想的成就和收获，对唯物辩证法的真理性和丰富性提供了新之又新的实证，把唯心主义者的阵地一个一个夺下来。被驱上了绝路的反动派之所以“进攻”，是因为他们已经无路可退；他们的骄横无耻和犬儒主义作风之所以达到了极点，是因为他们已经没有什么东西可丢弃。现在帝国主义思想家的向进步的创造思想作十字军进军——是命运已被注定的人们的残暴的表现，是企图使历史巨轮倒退的痉挛的阴谋。
    为了说明美国个性主义哲学的本质，并无证明它所含的唯心主义和信仰主义成分的必要。个性主义哲学家们是以唯心主义和僧侣主义的公开拥护者的姿态出现的，他们并不隐瞒他们对唯物主义哲学的敌意。他们率直地声明他们的世界观是带着宗教的、神秘主义的性质的。
    “宇宙的秘密究竟是什么呢？”——美国个性主义领袖，南加里福尼亚大学教授赖尔夫·佛里威林（Ｒａｌｐｈ　Ｔ．Ｆｌｅｗｅｌｌｉｎｇ）一面问，一面又回答说：“就是物质本身是依靠了一种最高力量的不断的、有目标的意志而存在的，现在所存在的关系和把握这些关系的个性都是这力量创造出来的。在这神秘莫测的力量的背后，——就是神，最高的个性，世界秩序真正秘密。”美国最有势力的唯心主义代表之一，哈佛大学教授霍金（Ｗ．Ｅ．Ｈｏｃｋｉｎｇ）应声附和着佛里威林的话说：“唯心主义是……我的形而上学的中心……我说：世界就是主观的自我（Ｓｅｌｆ）……一切物体的意义都结合在统一的意志中……我信仰神秘主义现实主义，这是唯一可以接受的一种现实主义。”
    宗教唯心主义的个性主义哲学并不隐瞒它是憎恨唯物主义世界观的。它的基础是：有意地和预谋地伪造现代自然科学结论，批评科学唯物主义世界观时用诡辩和撒谎的方法，替新教的教条辩护。他们反对唯物主义时所用的方法是欺骗、伪造、歪曲、毁谤的方法。他们对社会政治问题发议论时所用的就是这种方法。个性主义以假冒为善地、教条地空谈社会进步和民主为掩护，向真正的社会进步和真正的民主进行顽强的斗争，保护那敌视人民的美帝国主义的利益。
　　二、个性主义的本质
    “个性主义”（Ｐｅｒｓｏｎａｌｉｓｍ）一词出自“Ｐｅｒｓｏｎ”一字（拉丁文为“Ｐｅｒｓｏｎａ”）。“个性主义”意思就是“个性哲学”。在这名称之下出现的是直线的唯灵主义（Ｓｐｉｒｉｔｕａｌｉｓｍ），是公开的宗教形式的好战的唯心主义。个性主义是现在在美国资产阶级哲学中占着支配地位的一种客观唯心主义形式。这种形式在反动的新教阶层中最为流行。这一客观唯心主义变种的特点是它的多元主义（Ｐｌｕｒａｌｉｓｍ）：个性主义认为统一的精神不能使它满足，它给世界添加许多精神，添加一大批精神的实体。个性主义的原型是雷勃尼茨（Ｇ．Ｍ．Ｌｅｉｂｎｉｔｚ）的单元论（Ｍｏｎａｄｏｌｏｇｙ）——唯心主义的幻想，仿佛世界是由许多精神原素、单元（Ｍｏｎａｓ）、精神活动中心所构成的。
    波斯顿大学教授勃拉依特曼（Ｅ．Ｓ．Ｂｒｉｇｈｔｍａｎ）对个性主义作了如下的定义：“个性主义是一种信仰，这种信仰认为：宇宙是许多有意识的实体的合成体，物理学家所描写的能力（Ｅｎｅｒｇｙ）是行动中的神的意志，无意识和无个性的生活是不存在的。凡是所有的一切，都是有意识的精神或者是某一阶段或某一方面的有意识的精神。”所以根据这一点，关于自然和精神、生活和思想的关系的哲学的基本问题，在个性主义者看来，是以关于自然和“个性”（这是以精神与意识的同义语的姿态出现的）的关系的问题为形式的。“自然本身，”勃拉依特曼写道，“是个性的能力的经验和表现，个性是大于自然的。”“整个现实只有一种，那就是个性的意识。”
    个性主义认为世界是从意识派生的，因此结果它就拿非决定论（Ｉｎｄｅｔｅｒｍｉｎｉｓｍ）和因果关系——目的论（Ｔｅｌｅｏｌｏｇｙ）——来代替自然和社会中的客观的规律性。“神的个性”的目的和意志成为世界构造的基本原则，而取代了合于规律的、因果相关的运动和发展的科学原则。
    凭空虚构的“个性”概念的投机给个性主义者充当伪造反科学结论和进行社会反宣传的基本工具。个性主义者固执地认为：个性是最高的现实，终极的现实，最高的价值。所以，个性主义的“个性”当然是和现实中所存在的个性毫无共通点的。在个性主义看来，个性是和意识同一的。“个性，”据勃拉依特曼的定义，“是意识的复杂变化的统一体。”在他们看来，个性是非物质的基础，是精神能力的泉源。
    他们在哲学中把那被个性主义歪曲了解的个性的概念推到最前面去，想一箭射死双雕。因为“个性”是以形而上学的中心概念、以对象、客体、自然现象的对立物的姿态出现的，所以这个概念就被个性主义利用来向自然科学思想的基本原则斗争了。因为“个性”是以基本的社会历史概念、以文明的“终极价值”和“最高目的”的姿态出现的，所以这个概念就被利用来向社会科学中的科学方法和进步的社会政治倾向斗争了。
    无论个性主义者怎样强词夺理，他们总是无力隐瞒：他们的主义是资产阶级个人主义（Ｉｎｄｉｖｉｄｕａｌｉｓｍ）、资产阶级“个性”崇拜的翻版。马克思主义的出现，表示资产阶级个人主义世界观在理论上完全破产了。在反对剥削和暴力制度的斗争中生长和强大起来的、新的社会主义世界，在实践上不可推翻地证明了社会主义社会组织原理的优于私有财产制度和资产阶级个人主义。苏维埃社会的三十年过程清楚地证明：个性的全面发展及其自由和幸福，唯有在社会主义形式的生活和劳动的基础上，唯有在解除了资本主义苦役和替资本主义辩护的个性主义者所歌颂的资产阶级个人主义腐化影响的缚束的人民的道德政治统一的土壤上，才可能被争取到。
    因为“个性”被个性主义者归结到了意识上去，而意识又被归结到了“自由意志”上去，因此在这反动哲学看来，整个自然就是“目的的王国”、“普遍自由的王国”，这里在所有一切物体和过程后面都隐藏着看不见的“个性”。这“现代”哲学的拟人主义（Ａｎｔｈｒｏｐｏｍｒｐｈｉｓｍ）性质是这样明显，以致于个性主义者自己也不想否认这一点而承认“不免要被谴责为拟人主义”了。
    个性主义者企图和那讴歌反动的“Ｐｈｉｌｏｓｏｐｈｉａ　Ｐｅｒｅｎｎｉｓ”——即“永恒哲学”——及眩耀它的古老的天主教新烦琐哲学家们竞争，他们证明：他们的反动性还要古老，而且他们的反动性，象佛里威林带着喜剧性的自信所说的，一直要上溯到赫拉克里特和阿那克萨高尔。既然它在二十世纪复制出了原始野人的蒙昧的拟人主义概念，——还有什么能比它再古老呢！这些原始野人是依照自己的形象和样子给予周围一切物体和原素以灵魂、意识和意志的，区别不过是在于野人所给予树木、石头、河流、山岭的灵魂比美国保守主义教授的灵魂纯洁得多而已。
    不得不公正地承认：这些老爷们把拟人主义是推行得很彻底的，他们不但把它用到自然现象上去，而且也用到神的头上去。他们不取其他形式而宁取个性主义形式的唯心主义的基本动因之一就是个性主义是适应于正统的基督教教条——有神主义（Ｔｈｅｉｓｍ）的。有神主义是一种宗教信仰，它认为神是有人形的，神是具有理性和意志的特殊的，高级的“个性”，人是依照了神的“形象和样子”被创造出来的。有神主义就是拟人主义的神的概念——也就是一种迷信的概念，它在人的宗教幻想中接替了在它之前所存在的在飞禽走兽的形象中表现神的兽形神视主义（Ｚｏｏｍｏｒｐｈｉｓｍ）的概念。个性主义者把他们的全部哲学完全用来为这陈腐的宗教教条辩护。
    个性主义者口头上猛烈反对实用主义，而且步步宣誓忠于经验的实验科学，实际上作为他们最高规模的却是已经死亡的宗教教条，而这种教条，甚至三百年连那些有点接近科学的宗教拥护者自己来也已经不好意思提出了。“自然就是神的个性的表现”；“自然的唯一的实体就是神的个性”，——这就是三百年前反对当时已经过时的拟古主义神话学的资产阶级哲学的最新杰作。
    个性主义者把神的个性吸收到自己的体系里去，明显地暴露出了他们所空谈的构成人类社会的现实个性的本源、自由和独立都是虚构和伪造的。假使整个自然，照他们所断定，是神的个性的表现和“在神指示之下行动”的一切个性，那么个性主义者为了反对限制和缩小“个性”的自由和自决而提出的一切叫嚣有什么意义呢？个性主义者的所以要空谈“个性”及其“自由”，目的不过是为了剥夺真正的现实的人的精神自由，使他们屈从那用来加强剥削制度的宗教教条。个性主义者反宣传地批评哲学中的绝对主义（Ａｂｓｏｌｕｔｉｓｍ），仿佛为了恢复那被蹂躏的人权而把神的个性——教条的绝对主义的最恶劣形式——推上了王座。他们以拥护健全的个性开始，而以拥护健全的个性安息为结束。“在完全忘我之中，个性才能实现它真正的自我，”——佛里威林这样施弄妖术似地说。而且为了根绝一切疑虑，他说：“真正的个性主义者将达到自我的最高表现，不过这他是用忘我地为神服务的方法达到的……”佛里威林号召人们“成为一种力量的奴隶，对这种力量服务也就是最完善的自由”。
    庸俗的诡辩遮掩不了这一僧侣主义说教的真正内容。个性主义者约束精神自由的哲学，而提出了精神奴化的哲学；他们以全面的个性自我发展来迷惑人们，而提出了奴性地拜倒在“宇宙专制君主”脚下的个性的“忘我”。
　　三、偷天换日的卑污手法
    读了这些好战的反动宣言之后，除了轻视之外，个性主义者的伪善的论断会招致些什么后果呢？仿佛他们的哲学是完全和实验科学相符合的，仿佛现代自然科学是他们的忠实盟友。他们粗暴地伪造科学资料，竭力想强制科学去为它最凶暴的敌人——信仰主义——服务。
    现代实验物理学，据个性主义者断言，是和唯物主义水火不相容的；他们断定科学已经证明了唯物主义世界观的“破产”和实验地“确立”了个性主义唯心主义的假说。
    “唯物主义已经死了，”——霍金结束了他对唯物主义的“辩驳”之后，又残酷地着手他下一个“辩驳”。多奇怪，他们和这可怜的“死人”作战得多么热烈和多么愤激！每逢物理学上一有新发现，唯物主义就得到一次新的证实，这种证据越来越多，唯物主义的力量和影响也越来越强大。因此这些为反科学的、反动的唯心主义思想辩护的个性主义者要这样横冲直撞的乱来了。
    个性主义者引用来反对唯物主义的论证，大多数是旧的唯心主义的渣滓。他们的一切论证都是可怜的物理唯心主义老调，翻来复去说来说去总是一个题目：“物质消灭了。”个性主义者翻来复去唱的就是马赫主义的物质消灭的滥调，而对于他们那些毫无根据的主张曾经在列宁的“唯物主义和经验批判主义”一书中受到过毁灭性打击这件事，他们连一句话也不敢提到。他们不敢反对列宁的论证。他们顽固的不肯提到它，装出若无其事的样子。唯有用这种方法，用闭口不提和欺骗的方法，他们才能把唯物主义的胜利当作它的失败。
    二十世纪的物理学打垮了从前的形而上学的原子的概念。它证明了原子的复杂的可变的构造。在科学面前，开辟了一个复杂的原子内部规律性的新领域。原子从丰富的科学假说变成科学的实验研究的对象而可以加以分析、分裂和实验研究了。物质的物理构造的假说让位给确切可靠的物质构造的知识了。
    原子物理学的发现是科学的辩证唯物主义的胜利。这就是二十世纪物理学的成就的哲学意义。个性主义者一心一意想隐蔽这一不辩自明的物理科学发展的总结。他们追随在当年曾被列宁揭发过的那些物理唯心主义先驱者之后，专心一志地歪曲物理学发现的本质，不择手段地招谣撞骗、偷天换日——目的只有一个——就是“摧毁”唯物主义和建立唯心主义。
    个性主义者感觉到：物质自动的原理已被最新的物理学所证明，不必再以神为推动力，因此更增强了无神主义唯物主义的阵地，于是他们断定：“细胞和原子内部的活动并不是可以用来否定最高意志或神的存在的一种论证，而是可以证明他存在的一种自然证据。”
    物理学的发展，据个性主义者说，结束了物质的原子而恢复了雷勃尼茨的单元的地位。“物体的种子”并不是微小的物质体，而是力的中心，自动力的本源。这些“种子”的活动——就是宇宙理性的活动的表现。原子内部的能力的泉源是神的意志。
    起初个性主义者诬蔑地武断唯物主义把现实了解做死的、迟钝的、丧失掉自动性的东西。他们毁谤了唯物主义哲学之后，接着又得意洋洋地说：物理学的发现推翻了这样的自然观，所以唯心主义的把世界看作纯精神本质的活动范围，是正确的。
    偷天换日的歪曲方法是个性主义者在进行反唯物主义斗争中所用的基本方法。他们爱用这样的手法：他们拿辩证唯物主义和机械唯物主义看做是同一的东西，然后一面批评后者，一面装出样子，仿佛他们的批评老朽过时形式的唯物主义就是批评现代科学的唯物主义。
    霍金放肆地造谣，说唯物主义仿佛是在分裂物质、空间和时间，使它们变成特殊的本质，而不了解它们相互的依赖性。佛里威林应声附和地说，唯物主义……是保卫不断性的原理而否定自然发展中的间断性的。个性主义者唠叨不休地说：唯物主义否定质的现实性而把质的差别归结到量的差别上去；唯物主义解释不清楚变化和发展，它站在把因果一视同仁的阵地上，取消了新因素的产生。还有其他等等。
    个性主义毁谤者的这一切可怜的中伤只会引起人们深深的鄙视，原因很简单，因为他们的一切责难完全不适用于现代的科学的唯物主义，它们一点也损伤不到它。个性主义者所揭发的那一切形而上的和机械的观点，都和现代唯物主义漠不相关，而且是它所不能接受的。形而上的实体观，非唯物主义的空虚的空间的假定，把质的差别归结于量的差别，否定间断性，机械地了解因果性——这一切远在一百年前就被马克思唯物主义哲学所推翻了，虽然那时离开现代物理学的发现还有一个很长的时期，但是后来这些发现却出色地证明了马克思主义创始者们的理论假说的目光远大。
    马克思唯物主义哲学是不仅在反唯心主义的斗争中，而且是在反机械主义的斗争中成长和强大起来的。马克思主义证明了唯物主义的生命力和丰富性，因为它使科学思想解除了那妨碍它发展的形而上的和机械的教条主义，而在它面前开辟了无限的远景。科学地推翻机械主义——是马克思唯物主义哲学的伟大的历史性功绩。
    马克思主义批评了机械主义，它是从左的唯物辩证法的立场来批评机械主义的，僧侣主义是从右的信仰主义和反动派的立场来批评机械主义的，——但是个性主义者却拿后面的批评去和前面的批评对立起来。他们企图把机械主义的历史的限制性当作一切唯物主义的破产和一切科学思想的无力。
    然而也不能就此以为个性主义者的确不知道有马克思唯物主义的存在。勃拉依特曼在他的“自然与价值”一书中承认辩证唯物主义是优于以前各种形式的唯物主义的。“在某种程度上，”勃拉依特曼写道，“现代的自然主义对古代的唯物主义和甚至对十九世纪的机械主义和原子主义都占着明显的优势……从十九世纪中叶起，在达尔文、马克思和最新的物理学共同影响之下，唯物主义者开始了解：旧的固定的原子是多余的；他们开始了解能力的世界、力的范围、转变的过程。唯物主义成为辩证唯物主义，而且特别注意进化和活动。”
    个性主义者知道得很清楚：辩证唯物主义是解除掉了机械唯物主义的缺点和限制性的，但是他们在自己所有的著作中都还是把现代的科学唯物主义和旧的唯物主义一视同仁，而把批评机械主义描写成批评马克思唯物主义哲学。
    这些欺人勾当都是现代个性主义者所特有的。他们感到自己完全无力反对辩证唯物主义，为了执行自己主子的命令，他们只好运用适合于他们性格和能力的方法：依靠无耻的造谣和出名的虚构。
