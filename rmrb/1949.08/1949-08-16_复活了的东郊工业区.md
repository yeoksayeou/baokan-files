The Revived Eastern Suburbs Industrial Zone
    By Our Correspondent Shang Kai

    During the years of the Anti-Japanese War, the eastern suburbs of Beiping boasted over a dozen types of industrial production, including ironworks, forging, flour milling, papermaking, pharmaceuticals, tobacco, soy sauce, beer, canning, chemicals, ice making, electrical supplies, slaughtering, and brick and tile manufacturing, as well as a substation dedicated to providing electricity to the various factories. The Pinggu Road ran through it, with over a dozen wide crushed stone roads crisscrossing, connecting the factories into one area. This was the culmination of the Chinese people's blood and sweat. At the time, it was used by Japanese warlords and plutocrats to strengthen their exploitation and sucking of the Chinese people, supporting their imperialist war of aggression.

    In the winter of 1945, the Kuomintang replaced Japanese imperialism's rule, and the eastern suburbs industrial zone suffered serious theft and destruction. First, raw materials and finished products were sold, then machinery parts, and finally, factory buildings and walls were dismantled, selling wood, bricks, and tiles. Ironworks and pharmaceutical factories of considerable scale... now not a trace can be found. In the tobacco factory, amid a pile of rubble, only a white chimney stands there, lonely and desolate. Those that could not be dismantled and sold: factory buildings were collapsing, machines were rusting, and workers were scattered everywhere. On the eve of the liberation of Beiping, the Kuomintang bandit army simply carried out a major act of destruction: gun holes were dug in the soy sauce factory; iron pipes in the machinery factory were used as horse barriers; all the buildings and machinery equipment of the ice factory were blown up; and tens of thousands of meters of walls in various factories were pushed down. When the eastern suburbs industrial zone returned to the hands of the people, it was already ruins and overgrown with weeds. Only a few factories such as the beer and paper mills were barely operating, but they were also covered in scars and on their last legs!

    In the six months since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the workers have rebuilt their factories from the ruins as masters, overcoming many difficulties, and the eastern suburbs industrial zone has begun to revive.

    Jiulong Mountain, trampled on for years by the Japanese, Chiang, and bandit armies, is now once again covered with lush green crops. To its west, across a crushed stone road, is the site of the Beiping People's Paper Mill. The workers here had suffered cruel oppression for more than a decade. The excitement after liberation inspired all the staff, and they were determined to renovate and repair a paper machine that had been rusted for many years. This required adding calenders, paper cutters, digesters, beaters, boilers, water towers... and other equipment. At the time, completing this huge project encountered many difficulties due to technical and material conditions. Over the past three months, under the close unity of engineers and workers, these difficulties were finally overcome and this renovation project was completed. During the installation process, in a long trench under the machine room, a 190-inch-long water pipe needed to be connected and replaced. The narrow trench, with a volume of only two feet under the pipe, was half filled with sewage and mud, filled with unbearable odors. This would normally require a major demolition and repair, but time was tight and could not be allowed. So, ironworker Lin Fukun volunteered to crawl into the dark trench. He lay on his back in the mud at the bottom of the trench, facing the water pipe less than a foot away. The small space and the foul air made it impossible for him to turn around and made him want to vomit. Holding a flashlight in one hand, he disassembled and installed with the other, lying on his back, moving inch by inch from one end to the other. After the repair, he moved back in the same way. The restoration of this project promoted the early start of work. Now, two paper machines are running at high speed in the machine room all day long, and snow-white sheets of paper are sent to various printing factories.

    The North China Agricultural Machinery Factory was originally a repair shop during the Kuomintang period, which was broken into pieces. After a hurried reorganization this spring, it was formally established. This is the first sound of Beiping's military industry turning to peaceful production. At the factory construction conference, all the staff shouted the slogan "Strive to gradually realize the agricultural mechanization of North China." Over the past few months, engineers and workers have carefully researched and worked enthusiastically. Based on the soil, climate, and practical needs of North China, they have manufactured and promoted waterwheels, water pumps, and a large number of new agricultural machines. Recently, based on the needs of all parties, a plan has been formulated to manufacture more than 1,400 pieces of agricultural machinery within five months. In order to establish close contact with farmers, a propaganda team was organized, with everyone from the factory director to the workers participating. They carried tractors and various agricultural machines to help the masses harvest wheat and weed, allowing the masses to experiment on their own land. Countless farmers looked and touched with affection. From here, they saw the beautiful vision of agricultural mechanization in the motherland.

    On the south side of Pinggu Road is the Beiping No. 1 Soy Sauce Factory. Workers, in their spare time, repaired hundreds of feet of walls destroyed by the Kuomintang and the burned-out factory buildings. Recently, they have been researching ways to reduce costs and provide people with delicious seasonings at low prices.

    Crossing the Grand Canal and passing through Erzha Village, heading northeast, you can see a short gray wall in the distance. Two months ago, this was a pile of ruins, but now three brand-new factories have been built: the Baijiu Experimental Factory will study the use of machines to produce baijiu, gradually moving the North China brewing industry from manual to mechanized production. The Liqueur Factory uses various fruits to gradually replace food crops for winemaking, opening up sales channels for rural sideline production. The Printing Factory mainly undertakes all internal government publications, as well as stamp tax tickets, various account books, and receipts, avoiding merchant exploitation and saving people's expenses.

    Heading west along the crushed stone road to the kiln area, bricks and blanks are piled full of the square. Workers are working hard in the scorching sun and by the raging coal fire. Their task is to produce a large number of bricks to fully supply the needs of factories, schools, and residential buildings.

    The Beiping Inspection Section of the Pingjin Railway Bureau is also squeezed into the eastern suburbs. The tracks, crisscrossing, are lined with vehicles waiting to be repaired. To welcome "July 1st," 500 employees launched a production competition, working day and night to rush to repair a brand-new "Liberation" train to dedicate to the birthday of the Communist Party.

    On the south bank of the Grand Canal, returning east along Pinggu Road, you can reach the center of the eastern suburbs industrial zone. Climbing the red building of the brewery, overlooking the entire eastern suburbs: the motherland's young industrial construction is full of vitality like summer crops after rain, growing stronger every minute. She wakes up every day bathed in the morning sun, the whistle howls crisply, and workers gather from all directions. The song "The East is Red..." resounds throughout the eastern suburbs of Beiping.

　　复活了的东郊工业区
    本报记者  商恺
    在抗日战争的年代里，北平东郊有铁工、锻造、面粉、造纸、制药、烟草、酱油、啤酒、罐头、化工、制冰、电料、屠宰、砖瓦等十几种工业生产，以及专供各厂电力的变电所。平古路横贯其间，十几条宽阔的碎石路，纵横交错，将各厂连成一片。这是中国人民血汗的结晶。当时曾被日本军阀财阀用来加强对中国人民的剥削吸吮，支持它的帝国主义侵略战争。
    一九四五年的冬天，国民党代替了日本帝国主义的统治，东郊工业区遭到了严重的盗卖与摧残。先卖原料成品，再卖机器零件，最后拆厂房，拆垣墙，卖木料砖瓦。具有相当规模的铁工厂，制药厂，……如今再也找不到一点踪影。烟草厂一片瓦砾堆中，只剩下一幢白色的烟筒，孤零零的立在那里。拆不动卖不出的：厂房在坍塌，机器在生锈，工人们在到处流落。北平解放的前夜，国民党匪军，又索性来了一次大的破坏：酱油厂的厂房挖了枪眼；机器厂的铁管当了马栏；制冰厂的全部房舍和机器装备被炸毁了；各厂几万公尺的围墙，被推了个光。当东郊工业区回到人民自己手里来的时候，已是残垣断壁，荒草漫漫。仅剩的啤酒、造纸等几个厂子，虽然勉强开着工，但也是遍体鳞伤，奄奄一息了！
    解放后六个月来，在共产党领导下，工人们以主人的姿态从废墟上重建自己的工厂，克服了重重困难，东郊工业区开始复活了。
    长年被日蒋匪军践踏的九龙山，如今又长满了鲜绿的庄稼。在它的西边，跨过一条碎石路，是北平人民造纸厂的厂址。这里的工人，十余年来，曾受尽残酷的压榨。解放后兴奋的心情，鼓舞着全体员工，他们决心将一部多年锈蚀未动的抄纸机改装修复。这就需要添装压光机、切纸机、蒸煮器、打浆机、锅炉、水塔……等设备。在当时，完成这一巨大的工程，限于技术与物质条件，遭遇到了重重困难。三个月来，在工程师和工人的紧密团结下，终于排除万难完成了这一改装工程。按装过程中，在机器房下一条漫长的沟道里，需要接换一根长达一百九十英寸的水管，管下仅仅二英尺容积的窄狭沟道，有二分之一是污水烂泥，充满了令人难以忍受的臭味。这在通常是要大拆大修的，但时间紧促已不能容许。于是铁工林福昆自报奋勇，钻进了黑暗的沟道，他仰卧在沟底的烂泥上，面对着相距不到一英尺的水管，容积的狭小和空气的恶臭，使他无法转身，欲呕而不能。他一手握着手电筒，一手拆卸按装，仰卧着从这一端一寸一寸移到另一端，修复以后，再照样移回。这一工程的修复，促使了早日开工，如今两部造纸机，终日在机房里飞速的运转，雪白的纸片，被送进各个印刷厂里。
    华北农业机器厂，原为国民党时期的一个修械所，被破坏得支离破碎。今春经过匆忙的整理后，才正式成立。这是北平军工生产转为和平生产的第一声。在建厂大会上，全体员工一致喊出了“为逐步实现华北农业机械化而奋斗”的口号。几个月来，工程师和工人精心研究，热情的工作，根据华北土壤气候和实际需要，曾制造和推销了水车、水泵和大批的新式农业机械。最近，根据各方需要，又制订了五个月内制造一千四百余件农业机器的计划。为了和农民取得密切的联系，组织了从厂长到工人都参加的宣传队，携带拖拉机和各种农业机器，给群众割麦除草，让群众自己实地试验，无数的农民亲切看了又看，摸了又摸，他们从这里看到了祖国农业机械化美丽的远景。
    平古路南侧，是北平酱油第一厂，工人于工作之余，自己动手修复了被国民党破坏的几百丈垣墙，和被烧得焦头烂额的厂房。最近他们研究减低成本，廉价供给人民以美味的调料。
    北渡运河，经二闸村，东北行，远远望见一条灰色短墙，两个月前，这里还是一片残垣断壁，如今已修起三个崭新的工厂：白酒试验厂，将研究用机器试制白酒，使华北酿造业逐步由手工方式走上机械化生产。露酒厂是利用各种水果，逐步代替食粮制酒，给农村副业生产打开销路。印刷厂主要承印政府内部一切出版物以及印花税票、各种帐簿单据，避免商人剥削，节约人民的开支。
    沿碎石路西行，到窑业区，砖和坯排满了广场，工人们在炎炎的阳光下，在熊熊的煤火旁，紧张的工作。他们的任务，是大量制砖，充分供应工厂、学校、住宅等建筑的需要。
    平津铁路局北平检车段，也挤在东郊。纵横交错的轨道上，排列着待修的车辆。五百员工为迎接“七一”，曾展开了生产竞赛，日夜工作赶修出一列崭新的解放号列车，献给共产党的生日。
    运河南岸，再沿平古路折回往东行，可到东郊工业区的中心。登上啤酒厂的红色大楼，俯览东郊全境：祖国年青的工业建设，正如雨后的夏禾一样充沛着活力，每分钟都在壮大成长。她每天从朝阳润浴中醒来，汽笛清脆地吼鸣，工人从四面八方聚拢，“东方红……”的歌声，响澈了北平的东郊。
