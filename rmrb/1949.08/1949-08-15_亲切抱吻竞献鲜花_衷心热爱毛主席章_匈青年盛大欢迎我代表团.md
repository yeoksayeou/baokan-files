Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 14th: Budapest Dispatch: The Chinese Democratic Youth Delegation attending the World Youth Festival arrived in Budapest on the afternoon of the 9th after a journey of twenty days. The delegation included 117 members. The Soviet, Mongolian, and Korean delegations arrived in the same train. This is one of the earliest groups of delegations from over 70 countries to arrive in the Hungarian capital for the Youth Festival. The delegation received a grand welcome at the station, where cheers of "Long live Stalin," "Long live Mao Zedong," and "Long live Rakosi" resounded. The Chinese delegation's flags attracted great attention; the heroes in the Chinese delegation wearing various medals received even more attention and respect. The delegates accepted the embraces and kisses and bouquets of flowers from the Hungarian youth with ecstatic joy. The Chairman Mao badges they wore on their chests were, as at the Moscow train station, exchanged in an instant. A representative of the Hungarian People's Youth League specially pointed out in a welcoming speech at the station: "The youth of China and Mongolia, like us, are close to the Soviet Union, the bastion of world peace, and are fighting to defend world peace." A representative of the World Student Federation also gave a welcoming speech. Xiao Hua, the acting head of the Chinese delegation, then gave a speech of thanks, pointing out that the victory of the Chinese people was supported by the world democratic camp – first and foremost the Soviet Union. Chinese youth are fighting for peace, freedom, and independence together with the youth of the world. The Youth Festival will promote the unity of the world's youth and enable them to exert their strength even more.
