　　Man
　　—Recollections of Gorky, Part 1
　　By Soviet writer Sailebulefu, translated by Lao Rong

　　One evening, Gorky was reciting his poem "Man" at the home of Maria Andreyevna, an actress at the Moscow Art Theatre. The first part of the poem ended with a "postscript" that only existed in the original manuscript, which I have always kept and never published. "Here you can sing my song," Gorky wrote to Maria Andreyevna.

　　It is in those noisy, rough words that I hide the most precious dreams in my soul, the faith I hold, the faith that has given me and will continue to give me the strength to live. I have experienced much. Death often peers into my face, and I feel its bone-chilling coldness on my cheeks, it wants to strike my heart with a terrifying, icy touch, but death cannot kill my dreams.

　　The "mad god" repeatedly stretched its fiery wings, violently pressing down on my head, I felt flames drilling into my skull, but it also did not destroy my dreams.

　　"I often hear the devil's vicious laughter, mocking the ashes of youthful fantasies, but even the sharp knife of doubt has not extinguished my dreams, because they have already taken root in my heart."

　　Leonid Andreyev, Skitalets, and Ivan Bunin (Note: These three were all famous Russian writers of the early 20th century) listened to the poem each in their own way: the luxurious and beautiful Andreyev, wearing workers' clothes as beautiful as himself, puffed on his cigarette, following the rhythm of the poem; the sharp, rugged, and angular Skitalets roared, "That's nonsense!"; the strong, cypress-like Bunin stroked his beard with his fingers. Bunin was the first to break the silence, but he did not mention the poem itself, he asked Gorky how and when he first had the idea to write the poem "Man."

　　Gorky did not answer immediately. He folded the manuscript and stuffed it into his pocket. He lit a cigarette and flicked the ashes into the ashtray.

　　"When you talk or write about yourself, you must make it a mess," he said, stroking his beard. "I've noticed it several times in my own writing—if you arrange everything honestly as it happened, you'll find that the result is—literature. Haven't you experienced this?" he asked Bunin. "Ah! That has happened. Then you understand what I mean. There must be some specific rules for selecting material for writing. It is impossible to experience the same thing twice. Thoughts often confuse it… It's hard for me to tell you about 'Man.' If I were a musician, I could play it for you, but to explain it, that's difficult… But if you insist, I can try." Gorky paused again, his gaze fixed on a dark corner of the room, as if his memory was there.

　　"At that time, I was wandering everywhere. Drifting around… searching for my lost soul… a vexing job, like looking for a lost button on the floor. A simple little thing, a button, but you lose it, and you might drop your pants because of it. And pants, as you know, are the basic element of human culture… No, don't laugh! Remember what the Bible says in this regard! Adam's first thing was to put his legs into a pair of pants to hide the male genitalia. If the male genitalia were not hidden, what would be the meaning of our culture? So look at you! You should read the Bible… Yes, the Bible!"

　　Gorky blew at his cigarette and looked at the dark corner of the room.

　　"I was alone on the prairie… It was scorching weather, and I walked at least twenty miles that day. I was exhausted that night. I didn't want to go into the village to spend the night… I had a fight with my companions at that time. I felt a little tired of people who buzzed in the dark like mosquitoes but dared not bite… A pitiful animal, man, I felt. Have you ever observed, Ivan Alekseyevich (i.e., Bunin), the fewer the species, the larger the individual. Look at the elephant! If elephants became as numerous as mosquitoes, flying everywhere in the air, think how interesting life would become! Imagine the merchant Semiberov, walking to church with his wife… That is the element of respect and etiquette… The bells are ringing, the pigs are squealing, the sun is shining. Suddenly, if you like to think so, a two-ton mosquito bites the back of his neck. Before his wife can cry out, only his tailcoat and the church-going medal with a ribbon attached to the tailcoat are left! I imagine that in such an environment, the usual morality would also have greater capacity… But let's continue… That night I didn't go into the village, I found a withered willow tree in a small valley, lit a fire, and rested. When you are utterly exhausted and hungry, your body seems to lose weight, and there is only a monotonous sound buzzing in your head, like the buzzing in a telephone receiver. That buzzing, as if coming from afar, from some infinite distance… Perhaps from the vast emptiness of space.

　　"This is precisely the poetic state of mind… (to Bunin): Haven't you discovered this? On this day I cannot get rid of the habit of rhyme, but in those days, I was actually bewitched, well, I lay there, the flames warming my empty stomach, and I felt a kind of demand. Alexander Nikolayevich (that is, me, the author) here once told us how the Kyrgyz sing their songs on the plains. They sing about their affairs: 'The sun is shining… The camels are trudging a long way… I am dying of thirst.' Well, I was in this situation. It started like a prickling in the head, and then a series of words poured out: night… prairie… fire… by the fire, a man… what else? Oh, of course, there are the stars. What are the stars? A poetic question! I began to compare words, weighing their lightness and heaviness, calculating their value… Of course, you know, every word has its own special weight. Some are heavy, some are light… Our philosophers should study this question: the blood relationship between the pronunciation and meaning of words, eh? They might come to some very interesting conclusions. So I weighed them: night… fire… light, winged words… earth? A heavy, sticky word… stars? A prickly word… man? Hey, that is the deepest, most sluggish word… man! Chelovek. (Note: The Russian word Человек 'man' is composed of two ancient Russian words: 'Chelo' means the upper part of 'head,' and 'vek' means human life.) Do you understand what I mean? Chelo—head, vek—life… You know, it was as if something was burning in my body… as if I had shot myself again… I really remember jumping up excitedly… I stared at the sky, the stars… the prairie… nature! Wait, I said to myself, what is the meaning of all this without man? No meaning at all. Then, all this exists for him? For 'man'? Yes, it must be… I sat down and thought again, man—yes! From then on, I stuck with this point of view…"

　　Gorky tapped on the table with his fingers, knocking out the tune of a march.

　　"Hey, do you understand?" he asked, giving the table a final tap.

　　"Why don't you write it down?" Bunin said politely.

　　"I can't write it," Gorky replied listlessly, meaning that Bunin was not impressed by his story. "My work is still rough!… Very primitive! Like a fire brigade's military music… beating on a very, very big drum!"

Postscript: Sailebulefu is the pen name of the old Soviet writer Alexander Tikhonov. He was a good friend and old colleague of Gorky. They jointly edited many periodicals, such as the Bolshevik Party's student magazine "Young Russia" published in 1905, "Life News," "A Collection of Talks by Proletarian Writers," and after the October Revolution, "World Literature," "Factory History," "Famous People's Lives," and "Historical Novels," etc.

Currently, Tikhonov has completed the first volume of his "Memoirs," in which Gorky occupies an important and prominent position. This article is translated from the June 1946 issue of the English "Soviet Literature."

　　人
    ——回忆高尔基之一
    苏联：赛列勃洛夫作  劳荣  译
    有一天黄昏，高尔基在一个艺术剧院女演员马利亚·安德烈芙娜家里朗诵他底诗“人”。那诗的第一部分是用一个“后记”结束的，那“后记”只有原稿上有，始终被我保存着，没有发表。“这儿你可以唱我底歌啦，”高尔基那么写着，是对马利亚·安德烈芙娜说的。
    是那喧闹，粗砺的语词隐藏着我灵魂里最珍贵的梦想，我所持有的信仰，是那已经给我和将要继续给我生活下去的力量底信仰。我已经经历了许多。死亡时常窥视我底面孔，而且我脸颊上感到它沁骨的冷气，它想用恐怖的冰冷的触摸打击我底心，可是死神不能够杀死我底梦想。
    “疯神”一再伸展它火一样的翅膀，狂暴地压在我头上，我感到火焰钻进我底脑壳，可是它也没有毁灭我底梦想。
    “我时常听到恶魔狠毒的朗笑，嘲笑着青春幻想的灰烬，可是连怀疑的利刀也没有诛灭我底梦想，因为它已经生根在我底心里了。”
    莱奥尼达·安特烈夫，史基塔列茨和伊凡·布宁（注：这三人都是俄国二十世纪初叶的名作家）各人用各人的方法听着那首诗：豪华美好的安特烈夫穿着和他本身一样美好的工人服，把香烟吸出吸进，追随着那首诗的节拍；生切硬斩，棱角毕露的史基塔列茨吼叫着“那是胡扯！”；强壮的，柏树似的布宁用手指理着胡子。布宁第一个打破那沉默，可是他并不提到那首诗本身，他问高尔基怎么样以及在什么时候，第一次有了要写“人”这首诗的意思的。
    高尔基没有马上回答。他把原稿折起来，塞进裤兜里。他点了一支香烟，把烟灰弹在灰碟里。
    “你谈到或写到你自己时你必须把它弄成一团，”他拉着胡子，说。“我在自己写作时注意了好几次啦——你把一切事情老老实实照它发生的样子安排下去，你就发现那结果是——文艺。难道你没有这样经验过吗？”他问布宁。“啊！那是有过的。那末你就懂得我是什么意思了。为写作选择材料一定有些特定的规律。同样的事情想有两次经验是不可能的。思绪往往把它弄乱了……要我对你说‘人’的情形是很难的。如果我是一个音乐家，我能够为你演奏它，但要说明，那就难了……可是如果你坚持，我可以试一试。”高尔基又停顿了一下，他底目光凝视着一个幽黑的屋角，仿佛他底记忆就在那里。
    “那时我正在各地浮浪。到处漂游着……在寻找我失去的灵魂……一种令人压烦的工作，象在地板上寻找一个失去的钮扣。一个简单的小东西，一个钮扣，可是你失掉了它，可能因此掉了裤子。而裤子，象你所知道的，那是人类文化的基本要素……不，不要笑！记住圣经在这方面所说的！亚当的第一件事情是把两腿伸进一条裤子里去隐藏男子的私处。如果不把男子的私处隐藏起来，我们的文化将有什么意义？所以瞧你！你应该去读读圣经……是的，那圣经！”
    高尔基对着他底烟卷吹气，望着幽黑的屋角。
    我一个人在大草原上……那是酷热的天气，那天我至少走了二十哩。晚上我疲乏得要死。我不愿进村子去过夜……那时我和同伴们打了一架。我对象蚊子一样在黑暗里嗡叫而不敢去咬人的人们感到有点厌倦了……一种可怜的动物，人，我感到。你曾经观察过吗，伊凡·阿历克赛维支（即布宁），愈是少有的种族，个儿愈是大。瞧瞧象！如果象变得象蚊子一样多，在空中到处飞舞，你想想生活将变得多么有趣！你再想象那商人塞米柏洛夫，带着他老婆走在去教堂的路上……那是尊敬和礼节的要素……钟声在震鸣，猪在嚎叫，太阳闪着光芒。突然，如果乐意那么想，一只两吨重的蚊子咬了他底后脖根。在他老婆来得及叫唤出来之前，只剩下了他底燕尾服和系在燕尾服上的有缎带的去教堂佩带的勋章了！我想象在这样的环境下，通常的道德也会有更大的容量。……但继续说下去吧……那晚我没有进村子里，我找到了一个小谷里的一棵枯柳树，点了个火，就息了下来。在你疲乏和饥饿透顶的时候，你的身体似乎失去了重量，在你脑袋里只有一种单调的声音在嗡嗡鸣叫，象电话筒里的嗡声。那嗡声，好象是远处传来的，从什么无限的远处传来的。……也许是从星球的大空中间传来的。
    “这正是诗化的精神状态……（对布宁）：你没有发现这个吗？对这一天我不能除去韵律的习惯，但在那些日子里，实际上是着了魔啦，唔，我躺在那儿，火焰温暖了我的空肚子，我感到了一种要求。亚力山大·尼古拉维支（就是我·作者）在这里曾告诉过我们吉尔其斯人是怎样在平原上唱他们底歌的。他们歌唱着关于他们的事情：‘太阳放着光……骆驼跋涉长途……我渴得要命。’唔，我正是这种情形。开始好象是脑袋的激刺，然后倾出一连串语词：夜……大草原……火……在火旁，一个人……另外还有什么？喔，当然，还有星星。什么是星星呢？一个诗的问题！我开始比较语词，衡量它们的轻重，计较它们的价值……当然，你知道，每一个语词是有它特殊的重量的。有的重，有的轻……我们的哲学家应该研究这个问题：语词底发音与意义之间的血缘关系，唉？他们可能得到一些十分有趣的结论。所以我秤着它们：夜……火……轻的，长着翅膀的语词……大地？一种沉重的，有黏性的语词……星星？一种芒刺的语词……人？嗨，那是一种最深厚，最滞重的语词……人！契洛凡克。（注：俄文Ｃｈｅｌｏｖｅｋ‘人’这个字是由两个古代俄文合成的：‘契洛’的意义是‘头’的上部，‘凡克’的意义是人类生命。）你们明白我底意思吗？契洛——头，凡克——生命……你们知道，在我身体里好象有什么东西在燃烧……仿佛我又用枪打了自己……我确实记得我兴奋得高跳起来……我凝望着天空，星星……大草原……大自然！等等，我对自己说，没有男人，这一切有什么意义？什么意义也没有。那末，这一切是为他存在的？为了‘人’存在的？是的，一定是的……我坐下去又思索起来，人——是的！从那以后我就跟住了这个观点……”
    高尔基用手指弹着桌面，敲出一种进行曲的调子。
    “喂，你们懂得没有？”他询问，在桌面上弹了最后的一击。
    “你为什么不把它写出来呢？”布宁很有礼貌地说。
    “我写不了，”高尔基无精打采地回答，意思是布宁并没有对他底故事发生什么印象。“我底作品还是粗胚！……很原始的！好象消防队的军乐……敲着一个很大很大的大鼓！”

    附记：赛列勃洛夫是苏联老作家亚力山大·铁霍夫诺夫的笔名。他是高尔基底好朋友和老同事。他们共同编过许多期刊，如一九○五年出版的布尔什维克党的学生杂志“青年俄罗斯”，“生活报”，“普罗作家谈丛”，以及十月革命后的“世界文艺”，“工厂史”，“名人生活”和“历史小说”等。
    目前铁霍夫诺夫已完成他底“回忆录”第一卷，高尔基在这部书里占了一个重要而显著的地位。本文是从一九四六年六月号英文“苏维埃文艺”转译的。
