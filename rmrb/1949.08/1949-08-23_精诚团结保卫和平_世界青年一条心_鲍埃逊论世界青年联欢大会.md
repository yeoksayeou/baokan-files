Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, August 22nd: Budapest Dispatch: Bao Erxun, Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, stated at a press conference here on the 18th that many delegates participating in the festival had to overcome enormous difficulties to reach Budapest. Reactionary governments used measures such as refusing to issue visas and passports, refusing to exchange foreign currency, and prohibiting delegates from transiting to obstruct delegations from coming to Budapest. Bao Erxun pointed out that all the delegates participating in the festival were very enthusiastic about the event. They understand that active participation in this festival will turn the event into a powerful demonstration of the world's youth's will to fight for peace and a better future. Bao Erxun said: "The festival has shown that young people are united in their actions and aspirations, and they strive to express their sincere unity and will to fight for peace."
