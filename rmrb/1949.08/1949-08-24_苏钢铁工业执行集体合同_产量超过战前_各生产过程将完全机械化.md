Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 23rd: Moscow dispatch: The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions began its plenary session in Moscow on the 19th. The plenary session first heard a report on the implementation of collective contracts in the Soviet steel industry. Kuzmin, Minister of the Soviet Steel Industry, said in his report: The implementation of collective contracts in the steel industry has brought new achievements to this industrial lifeline of the socialist economy. The output levels of all major production items have now exceeded pre-war levels. In the first half of this year, pig iron production increased by 20% compared with the first half of last year, steel by 26%, and rolled metal production increased by 29%. Labor efficiency increased by 16%. Production costs were reduced by 7%.

At the same time, mechanizing the production process is also one of the main items of the collective contract. Soviet workers, engineers, technicians and staff are working hard to improve the technology of the production process, mechanize the production process, and use new working methods. In the first half of this year, a total of 25,000 suggestions for rationalizing the production process were adopted and implemented in the steel industry. Processes such as charging blast furnaces, pouring pig iron, loading rolled metal, and many other production processes are being mechanized. These will provide more healthy working conditions. Now the main work in the steel industry has become taking care of automatic machines, inspecting and adjusting the production process, and the like. The collective contract of the steel industry has included special clauses on technical education for workers. The movement for workers to master technology has developed on a large scale. Stakhanovite schools and advanced work training schools have been established in many enterprises.

The part of the collective contract concerning workers' welfare has also been implemented perfectly. The total area of ​​public buildings handed over to steel workers this year is more than 200,000 square meters, and 20 clinics and 34 hospitals are under construction. The Ministry of Steel Industry has opened 1,000 kindergartens for steel workers, taking care of 50,000 children of male and female workers. This year, 90 more kindergartens and 44 nurseries will be established.

　　苏钢铁工业执行集体合同
    产量超过战前
  　各生产过程将完全机械化
    【新华社北平二十三日电】莫斯科讯：全苏职工会中央理事会于十九日在莫斯科开始举行全体会议。全会首先听取苏联钢铁工业中执行集体合同情形的报告。苏联钢铁工业部部长库兹明在报告中说：钢铁工业中执行集体合同的结果，给社会主义经济的这一工业命脉带来了新的成就，一切主要生产项目的产量水平，目前都已超过了战前。今年上半年的铣铁生产比去年上半年增加百分之二十，钢百分之二十六，辗金属产量则增加了百分之二十九。劳动效率提高了百分之十六。生产成本减低了百分之七。
    同时，使生产过程机械化，也是集体合同的主要项目之一。苏联的工人、工程师、技师与职员正奋力改进生产过程的技术，使生产过程机械化，并使用新的工作方法。今年上半年中，钢铁工业中共采纳执行了二万五千个使生产过程合理化的建议。象装填鼓风炉、倾倒铣铁、装载辗金属及许多其他生产过程，都正在机械化中。这些将提供更适于健康的劳动条件。现在钢铁工业中的主要工作，已经成了照管自动机器、检查与调节生产过程之类的工作。钢铁工业的集体合同中已列入了对工人进行技术教育的特别条款。工人争取精通技术的运动，已发展为广大的规模。许多企业中已建立起斯塔哈诺夫运动者学校与优等工作训练学校。
    集体合同中关于工人福利的部分，也执行得很完满，今年交给钢铁工人的公共建筑，总面积为二十多万平方公尺，还有二十个诊疗所和三十四个医院在建筑中。钢铁工业部已给钢铁工人开办着一千个幼稚园，给男女工人们照顾着五万儿童，今年将再建立九十个幼稚园与四十四个托儿所。
