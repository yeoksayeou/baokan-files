Gorky's Works in the Soviet Union
Liu Defu

The works of Gorky, the founder of Soviet literature and a great revolutionary writer, in the Soviet Union, according to the statistics in the Moscow News special issue commemorating the tenth anniversary of Gorky's death in 1946, had already reached such a large number:

Gorky's works in the Soviet Union exist in sixty-six different language versions, totaling 42 million copies.

In the twenty years before the October Revolution, the total number of Gorky's works published in Russian was 1,072,000 copies, and at the same time, 311,000 copies were printed in seven other languages of foreign expatriates during the Tsarist era.

Some ethnic groups had no written language before the October Revolution, and now they can also read the works of this great writer in their own language.

The most widely read is his novel "Mother," which the author wrote in 1906 while living in the United States. It has been reprinted 106 times, with a total circulation of 1,747,100 copies in 28 languages. The second most popular is the first part of Gorky's series of autobiographical novels: "My Childhood," which has been reprinted as many as 77 times.

    高尔基的作品在苏联
    刘得复
    苏联文学的奠基者、革命文豪高尔基的作品在苏联，根据莫斯科新闻一九四六年高尔基逝世十周年纪念特刊上的统计，即已达到那样庞大的数字：
    高尔基的著作在苏联有六十六种不同的语言的版本，总数为四千二百万册。
    十月革命前的二十年间，以俄罗斯文字出版的高尔基的作品总数是一百零七万二千册，同时并以七种其他沙皇时代的外国侨民的文字刊印了三十一万一千册。
    有些民族十月革命之前是没有文字的，现在也能以自己的文字来阅读这位伟大作家的作品了。
    读者最广的是他的小说“母”，这是作者一九○六年侨居美国时写的，已再版一○六次，总发行额是一百七十四万七千一百册，以二十八种语言。其次就是高尔基一连串自传式的小说的第一部分：我的童年，共再版七七次之多。
