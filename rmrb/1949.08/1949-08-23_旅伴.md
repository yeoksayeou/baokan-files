　　Travel Companions
    Panova
    (By Soviet writer Panova, translated by Su Ling, proofread by Cao Jinghua)
    Part One: Night
    Chapter One: Danilov
    "Here are the instructions. You're literate, read them. You can choose how to use the personnel, we won't argue—no time for that."
    "Who's the commander?"
    "There isn't a commander yet," Potabenko replied.
    "There will be a commander later. You organize it."
    "Where's the train?" Danilov asked.
    Potabenko laughed.
    "Brother, there isn't a train either. The train is in the repair shop, not finished yet. You organize your thing."
    "I'll go organize it," Danilov said, standing up.
    He met Grigoriev, the chairman of the local committee, at the door. Grigoriev, panting, handed him a certificate of exemption.
    "Stick this thing somewhere," Danilov said. "Tell Mekulov (he's the deputy manager) to come to the trust office tonight. I need to hand over the business to him."
    But he didn't come that night. Mekulov didn't wait for him until the twenty-sixth, by which time he had received formal appointment from the ministry, appointing him to succeed Danilov as manager of the trust.
    Danilov spent all three days organizing the ambulance train. He needed a lot of manpower: a resident doctor, an assistant doctor, a wound dressing nurse, a head nurse, nurses, medics, guards, stokers, power room drivers, electrical technicians, conductors, vehicle repairmen… It wasn't just Danilov running around the city to find the required staff – the city was organizing fifty ambulance trains, and each train urgently needed resident doctors, nurses, conductors…
    Danilov had his own views on personnel selection, and many people found these views very strange.
    When a problem arose, that is: choosing a confident, generous, funny, and strong city male assistant doctor, or choosing a young, impatient, pale-faced rural female assistant doctor with two years of experience, he unhesitatingly chose the latter.
    So when this terrible, hook-nosed, vision-impaired wound dressing nurse Yuli came to him, he wasn't afraid at all, but rather happy. He knew at a glance that this was exactly what he needed.
    The medics were selected from those mobilized. The Red Cross sent some nursing school graduates.
    He went to the barracks, where people were sitting on bundles and boxes as if they were at a station, and he shouted:
    "Are there any assistant doctors here? Any pharmacists? Any stokers? Comrades, pay attention! Any pharmacists?"
    Then a small woman walked up to him; she had a thoughtful, cunning, and funny boyish face. Wearing a blue undershirt. Short hair.
    "Are you a pharmacist?" Danilov asked.
    "No," she replied. "I'm a physical education teacher."
    "We don't need physical education," he said.
    She laughed. (To be continued) (Attached photo)
    He shouted: "Are there any assistant doctors here? Any medicine? Any stokers? Comrades, pay attention! Any pharmacists?"

    第一部　夜
    第一章　达尼洛夫
    “有训令的，就是这。你是识字人，读一读吧。人员想怎么用，你挑着用吧，咱们不会争吵的——没工夫呵。”
    “司令是谁？”
    “司令还没有呢，”波塔宾珂回答着。
    “将来有司令的，你组织吧。”
    “列车在那儿？”达尼洛夫问着。
    波塔宾珂笑起来。
    “老兄，列车也没有呵。列车在修理场里，还没有修完的。你组织你的吧。”
    “我去组织，”达尼洛夫说着站了起来。
    他在门里碰见地方委员会主席格里戈里耶夫。格里戈里耶夫气喘喘的递给他一张免役证。
    “你把这张东西贴到什么地方吧，”达尼洛夫说道，“你告诉梅库洛夫（这位是他的副经理），叫他晚上到托辣斯里来。我要对他办移交呢。”
    可是那天晚上他并没有来。直到二十六日梅库洛夫才等到他，那时他已经得到部里正式委任，任命他继达尼洛夫做托辣斯经理。
    这三天的工夫，达尼洛夫全忙在组织救护列车上去了。需要好多人手呢：一个常务医生，一个助理医生，一个裹伤女护士，一个看护长，女护士，卫生兵，卫士，司炉，发电室司机，电气技师，车掌，车辆修理匠……不是达尼洛夫一个人遍城跑着找所需的工作人员呵——城里组织着五十列救护火车呢，每一列车都正迫切的需要着常务医生，男女护士，车掌……
    达尼洛夫对于人选有自己的看法，这看法好多人都以为很奇怪的。
    当发生问题的时候，就是说：挑一个自信的，大方的，滑稽和强壮的城市的男助理医生呢，或是挑一个有两年经验的，年轻的，性急的，面带病容的乡村女助理医生呢，——那他就毫不迟疑的挑选了后者。
    于是当这位可怕的，红得好象印第安人似的钩鼻子，视力弱的裹伤女护士尤丽来到他跟前的时候，他不但不害怕，反而高兴起来。他一看就晓得这正是他所需要的呢。
    卫生兵是由动员来的人里边选出来的。红十字会派了些护士学校毕业的女生。
    他去到营房里，那儿的人就象在车站似的，都坐在包袱和箱子上，他大声叫着：
    “这儿有助理医生没有？有药剂师没有？有司炉没有？同志们，请注意！有药剂师吗？”
    于是有一个小个子的女人走到他跟前；她有一付沉思，狡诈而又可笑的男孩子的面孔。穿着一件蓝卫生衫。剪发。
    “你是药剂师吗？”达尼洛夫问道。
    “不是的，”她回答道。“我是体育教员。”
    “我们不要体育的。”他说道。
    她笑起来了。  　（未完）（附图片）
    他大声叫着：“这儿有助理医生没有？有药没有？有司炉没有？同志们，请注意！有药剂师吗？”
