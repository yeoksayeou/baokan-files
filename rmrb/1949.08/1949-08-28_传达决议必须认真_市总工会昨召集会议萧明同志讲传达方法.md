　　Resolutions Must Be Seriously Communicated
    City Federation of Trade Unions Convened a Meeting Yesterday, Comrade Xiao Ming Spoke on Communication Methods
    [This City News] In order to strengthen the communication of the resolutions of the Municipal People's Representative Conference, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened a meeting last night (27th) for the heads of the trade union offices in various districts, as well as representatives from various state-owned factories and private factories and industries who attended the People's Representative Conference. Over a hundred people attended. Comrade Xiao Ming reported on how to communicate the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference to the masses. He first pointed out that the communication of the People's Representative Conference by various units was not thorough enough or widespread enough. Some communicated to the masses, some only to the cadres, and the leadership did not grasp it tightly. In this way, our workers' actions to implement the resolutions will also be slow. Therefore, Comrade Xiao Ming called for actively carrying out communication and publicity, and quickly convening mass meetings, but do not take up production time, and the meetings should not be too long. Before the communication, there should be sufficient preparation, and after explaining the process, main achievements, and resolutions of the conference, the content of the resolutions should be linked to the factory, industry, and the workers themselves, so that the masses can deeply understand and then immediately take action and resolutely implement the resolutions. The content of the communication can be based on the "Publicity Outline" printed by the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as the conference documents compiled by the secretariat of the People's Representative Conference, and the broadcast speech of Comrade Xiao Ming published in the People's Daily on the 24th. The main issues to be explained are: 1. Defend the people and suppress counter-revolutionaries; 2. Restore and develop production; 3. Strengthen workers' learning and the education of workers' children; 4. Carry out production and savings; 5. Do a good job in trade union work, so that workers understand how to assist the government in striving to complete these five tasks.

　　传达决议必须认真
    市总工会昨召集会议萧明同志讲传达方法
    【本市讯】市总工会为加强对本市各界代表会议决议的传达工作，昨（二十七）晚召集各区工会办事处负责人，及出席各界代表会议的各公营工厂及私营工厂各行业代表开会，到会百余人，由萧明同志报告如何向群众传达各界代表会议决议。他首先指出各单位对各界代表会议传达的不够深入不够广泛，有的向群众传达了，有的仅向干部传达，领导上抓的不紧，这样，我们工人对执行决议的行动也就会迟缓了。因此，萧明同志号召要积极进行传达和宣传，并迅速召开群众性大会，但不要占用生产时间，会不要开得太长，传达以前要有充分准备，把大会经过及主要成就和决议讲过后再把决议内容联系到本厂本行业和工人自己，使群众能深切了解，进而立即行动，坚决执行决议。传达的内容可根据中共北平市委宣传部印好的“宣传大纲”，还有各界代表会议秘书处编印的会议文献，和二十四日人民日报所载的萧明同志广播词，主要问题要说明：一、保卫人民镇压反革命，二、恢复与发展生产，三、加强工人学习和工人子弟教育，四、开展生产节约，五、搞好工会工作，使工人了解怎样协助政府为完成这五项工作而奋斗。
