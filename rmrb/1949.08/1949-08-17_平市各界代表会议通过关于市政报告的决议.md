　　【Ping City News】The fourth day (12th) of the Ping City Representatives Conference of All Circles unanimously passed a resolution regarding the municipal report. The full text of the resolution is as follows:

　　The Ping City Representatives Conference of All Circles, after all representatives listened to the report by Ye Jianying, Director of the Military Control Commission and Mayor of Ping City, on the takeover and administration work, and the supplementary reports by Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu and Bureau Chief Tan Zhengwen, unanimously expressed satisfaction and indicated their unqualified acceptance.

　　In the past six months, the Ping City Military Control Commission and the People's Government, thanks to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the joint efforts of more than two million citizens, have smoothly completed various takeover tasks, rapidly established a people's revolutionary regime, and promoted various construction works, achieving great success. Taking over such a large city was an extremely arduous task, and establishing a revolutionary people's regime in an ancient city that had long suffered from feudal exploitation and reactionary rule was an even more difficult task. In Ping City, which has always been a consumer city, income has far failed to meet expenditure, and yet such great achievements have been made, which is indeed rare. All successes, we must first attribute to the correctness of the policy, and at the same time, we must attribute them to the correct implementation of the policy by the staff. We would like to express our deep gratitude and pay our highest respects to the government staff.

　　The three important tasks mentioned in the administrative report are: first, to further consolidate the revolutionary order of the people of Ping City; second, to adopt all effective methods to continue to restore and develop the production of Ping City; and third, to continue to develop the people's cultural and educational undertakings. We believe that these are all practically in line with current needs, are necessary steps to transform a consumer city into a production city, and are necessary steps to establish a new democratic New Ping City. We must call on the two million citizens of Ping City to practice streamlining under the dual tasks of supporting the front line and building New Ping City, to economize on clothing and food, to overcome all difficulties, to develop production, to increase wealth, and to work together with the government with the greatest strength to complete these central tasks.

　　Editor's Note: The summary of Mayor Ye Jianying's report at the Ping City Representatives Conference of All Circles was not received the previous day, so it is published as a supplement today. Please pay attention to it.

　　平市各界代表会议通过关于市政报告的决议
    【平市讯】北平市各界代表会议第四日（十二日）会议中，曾一致通过关于市政报告的决议，决议全文如下：
    北平市各界代表会议，全体代表听取了军管会主任兼北平市市长叶剑英关于接管与施政工作报告，和张友渔副市长谭政文局长的补充报告后，一致认为满意，并表示无保留的接受。
    半年来北平军事管制委员会和人民政府由于中国共产党的正确领导和二百余万市民共同努力顺利地完成了各项接管工作，迅速地建立了人民革命政权，推进了各项建设工作，获得了很大的成就。接管这样一个大城市，本是一件极端繁重的工作，而在长期遭受封建剥削和反动统治的古老都市，建立起革命的人民政权，更是一件万分艰巨的工作，在向来是消费都市的北平，收入远不抵支出，而能有这样大的成就，确是难得，一切成功，我们首先要归功于政策的正确，同时也要归功于工作人员正确执行了政策，我们要对政府工作人员，表示深深的感谢，并致崇高的敬意。
    施政报告中所提到的三项重要工作，第一，进一步的巩固北平人民的革命秩序；第二，采取一切有效的方法，继续恢复与发展北平的生产；第三，继续发展人民的文化教育事业，我们认为都是切实符合当前需要的，是把消费的城市转变为生产城市的必要步骤，是建立新民主主义的新北平的必要步骤，我们要号召北平二百万市民在支援前线建设新北平的双重任务下实行精简，节衣缩食，克服一切困难，发展生产，增加财富，以最大力量，和政府共同努力，完成这些中心工作。
    编者按：叶剑英市长在北平各界代表会议上的报告摘要，因前日未收到，特于今日补刊，请读者注意。
