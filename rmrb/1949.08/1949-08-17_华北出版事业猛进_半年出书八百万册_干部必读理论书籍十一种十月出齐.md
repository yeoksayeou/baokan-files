Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: The publishing industry in North China has made significant progress in the past six months. From the liberation of Tianjin and Beiping to the end of July, the Liberation Press and Xinhua Bookstore in North China have published and reprinted a total of more than 310 kinds of books, about eight million copies, of which first editions and revised editions account for about a quarter. The capacity for publishing books has also increased compared to the past. The Liberation Press and Xinhua Bookstore publish an average of one kind of book per day in Beiping and Tianjin, with each edition printing 10,000 to 30,000 copies. The Beiping Xinhua Printing Factory can now produce more than four million characters per month, using more than 3,000 reams of paper.

Of the twelve essential theoretical books for cadres designated by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, except for "Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on China," which is still being compiled, the remaining eleven, namely: Social Development History, Political Economy, The Communist Manifesto, Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, The State and Revolution, “Left-Wing” Communism: an Infantile Disorder, Foundations of Leninism, History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course, Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction, and Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on Methodology, have all been compiled and proofread by the Liberation Press. The first to fourth books have already been published, with an initial print run of 50,000 copies each, and the rest will be published in the above order in full by mid-October.

For this semester, by early August, the North China Xinhua Bookstore had printed 3.8 million copies of elementary school textbooks, and the North China United Publishing House had printed 1.5 million copies, not counting those printed by the provinces themselves. The Textbook Compilation and Examination Committee of the North China People's Government Ministry of Education has recently revised or re-edited thirteen kinds of textbooks, totaling twenty volumes, which are also being typeset and printed.

Among all the books, Chairman Mao's works are the bestsellers. The initial print run of "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" was 50,000 copies in Beiping, and nearly 40,000 copies were sold in Beiping and Tianjin alone in less than half a month. The second edition of 50,000 copies was published in early August.
