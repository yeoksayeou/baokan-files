Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th: Changchun, which has been liberated for more than eight months, has now been transformed from a devastated dead city, ruined by the Kuomintang bandit gang, into a thriving people's city. The railway from Harbin in the north to Shenyang in the south was connected in February this year. Trams and buses in the city have resumed operation, and the city's water and electricity supply is sufficient.

There are already 55 state-owned factories in Changchun that have resumed work. More than 4,500 private factories have resumed production. More than 5,700 private shops have opened. Cooperatives organized according to the needs and voluntary participation of the people, including supply and marketing, consumption, hygiene, construction, and other types, total 93. At present, there are more than 10,000 industrial and commercial enterprises in the city, while there were only more than 210 when it was first liberated. In order to support private industries that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihoods, the government has provided a large amount of loans, and state-owned enterprises and companies have solved the production difficulties of private factories by lending raw materials and collecting finished products. In order to improve the lives of workers and peasants, state-owned commercial enterprises such as grain, fuel, and department store companies have supplied more than 27.7 million jin of grain, more than 97,000 tons of raw coal, and agricultural tools and daily necessities worth about 16 million Northeast currency to various cooperatives or consumers in eight months. Changchun Department Store alone saved buyers more than 500,000 yuan in half a year. Cooperatives have also played a significant role in eliminating the intermediate exploitation of private merchants and helping the government stabilize prices, and they have helped nearly 4,000 unemployed people find jobs.

Changchun had a population of 600,000 to 700,000 during the Anti-Japanese War. After two years and five months of Kuomintang rule, only about 100,000 remained. Now the population has increased to more than 420,000, of which about 60,000 are manual and mental laborers. The political status and living standards of workers have now been improved. Labor insurance has been implemented in state-owned factories since July 1, and workers have high enthusiasm for labor. In the two production competitions to welcome "May Day" and "July 1st," many factories completed or exceeded their planned tasks ahead of schedule. The Changchun Youth League now has more than 1,000 members and has become the core of uniting young people. Women also have organizations. On July 2, Changchun held a city-wide People's Representative Conference, in which representatives from workers, peasants, and other strata participated. This is unprecedented in the history of Changchun.

Changchun's education has also recovered rapidly. There is now one college or above, seven middle schools, and one normal school, with more than 9,000 college and middle school students; 103 primary schools, with more than 40,000 primary school students. There are 65 workers' night schools and mass night schools, and 130 literacy classes. Most districts and streets have folk education centers or reading rooms.

    人民的长春
    解放前惨遭国民党匪帮破坏
    解放后八个月即已欣欣向荣
    【新华社北平四日电】解放了八个多月的长春，现在已经由被国民党匪帮毁坏得破烂不堪的死城，变成了一座欣欣向荣的人民城市。北到哈尔滨，南到沈阳的铁路，今年二月就已经接通了。市内的电车、公共汽车都已恢复行驶，全市水电也都供应充足。
    长春公营工厂已有五十五家复工。私营工厂有四千五百多家已恢复生产。私人商店开业的有五千七百多家。按照人民的需要和自愿组织起来的合作社，包括供销、消费、卫生、建筑等种类，共有九十三个。现全市共有工商业共一万余家，而刚解放时则仅有二百一十余家。为了扶助有益国计民生的私营工业，政府曾予以大量贷款，公营企业公司则以贷原料收成品的方式解决各私营厂生产的困难。为了改善工人、农民的生活，国营商业如粮食、燃料、百货等大企业公司，八个月中共廉价供给各合作社或消费者粮米两千七百多万斤，原煤九万七千多吨，农具和日用品约值东北币一千六百多万万元。仅长春百货公司一家，半年内就让买主节省了五十多万万元。各合作社在消除私商的中间剥削和帮助政府平抑物价上也起了不少作用，它们并帮助将近四千个失业者找到了职业。
    长春在抗日战争时原有六七十万人，国民党统治了两年五个月后，只剩下了十万左右。现在人口已经增加到四十二万以上，其中约六万人是体力和脑力劳动者。工人的政治地位和生活水平现都已提高了。七月一日起各公营工厂已实行劳动保险，工人劳动热情很高。在迎接“五一”和“七一”的两次生产竞赛中，很多工厂提前完成或者超过了预定任务。长春青年团现有团员一千多人，已成为团结青年的核心。妇女也有了组织。七月二日，长春曾召开了全市人民代表会议，工人、农民以及其他各阶层都有代表参加。这在长春的历史上是空前的。
    长春的教育也已迅速恢复，现有专科以上学校一所、中学七所、师范一所，大、中学生共九千多人；小学一百零三所，小学生四万多人。工人夜校和群众夜校六十五处，识字班一百三十处。各区各街多设有民教馆或阅览室。
