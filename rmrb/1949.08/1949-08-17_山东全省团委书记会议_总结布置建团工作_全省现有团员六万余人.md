　　Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League Holds Meeting
    Summarizing and Arranging League Building Work
  　Over 60,000 League Members in the Province
    [This newspaper dispatch] Jinan News: The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League convened a meeting of local League committee secretaries, which began on August 2nd and successfully concluded on the 10th. The meeting summarized the League building work of the first half of the year (after the announcement of the Central Committee's resolution on League building) and arranged and discussed the work for the next six months. The summary pointed out that the achievements of the past six months were: In coordinating with the central work of the Party, League organizations in various regions have carried out preliminary rectification, restoration, and development, and there are now more than 63,900 League members in the province; the broad masses of League members have actively participated in production, study, and various movements, and have played an exemplary role in the movements. For example, the Youth League members of the Xuzhou Machine Factory took the lead in repairing the "Youth" locomotive. Due to extensive propaganda and the practical actions of the League members, the League has won praise and support from the broad masses, and a large number of progressive young people are eagerly seeking to join the League. The main shortcomings are the mistakes of closed-doorism; some areas have also deviated from the central work of the Party, and have unilaterally carried out League building. These urgently need to be corrected. Regarding the work for the next six months, the meeting arranged as follows: 1. Through the central work, discover, cultivate, and educate young activists, develop League members on the basis of conscious voluntarism, and establish and consolidate the League's organization. In areas where League building already has a foundation, the first step is to restore and reorganize, and from the restoration and reorganization, to develop universally in a planned and step-by-step manner; in areas newly established this year, where the work has not been well implemented and educated, and the organization is loose and weak, the current work is mainly to consolidate and improve, and to develop from consolidation; in areas where trial construction has not yet been carried out, the League organization should be established with a focus and experience should be gained before being promoted externally (the above refers to the old areas, semi-old areas, and cities); in new areas where the masses have not yet been mobilized, mass movements should be used to organize and educate the broad masses of young people, carry out League building, and then gradually promote it. 2. Continue to implement the Central Committee's resolution on League building and the resolutions of the League Congress. 3. With the Youth League members as the core, mobilize the broad masses of young people to actively participate in production and various tasks. 4. Establish and improve the League's leadership organs at all levels, promote outstanding and upright young Party members and League members to work in the leadership organs, and strengthen the training and study of existing cadres.

　　山东全省团委书记会议
    总结布置建团工作
  　全省现有团员六万余人
    【本报讯】济南消息：山东省团委召开的各地团委书记会议，自八月二日起，已于十日胜利闭幕。会议总结了上半年的建团工作（中央建团决议公布后），和布置讨论了今后六个月的工作。总结中指出半年来的工作成绩是：在配合党的中心工作中，各地团均作了初步整顿、恢复和发展，现全省已有团员六万三千九百余名；广大团员积极投入生产、学习及各种运动，并在运动中起了模范带头作用。如徐州机厂青年团员，带头抢修“青年号”机车等事迹。由于广泛宣传和团员的实际行动，团得到了广大群众的好评和拥护，大批进步青年都迫切要求入团。缺点方面主要是犯了关门主义的偏向；还有的地区脱离了党的中心工作，孤立地进行建团的偏向。这些都急需纠正。关于今后半年的工作，会议布置为：一、通过中心工作，发现培养教育青年积极分子，在自觉自愿的基础上发展团员，建立与巩固团的组织。在建团已有基础的地区，首先是恢复整理，从恢复整理中，有计划有步骤地普遍发展；今年新建立的地区，没经很好的贯彻教育，组织松懈无力的，目前工作主要是巩固提高，从巩固中进行发展；还没有进行试建的地区，应有重点的建立团的组织并取得经验后，再向外推广（以上指老区半老区和城市）；在群众还没有发动的新区，要通过群众运动，组织教育广大青年，进行建团，再逐步推广。二、继续贯彻中央建团决议及团代大会决议。三、以青年团员为核心，发动广大青年积极参加生产及各种工作。四、建立和健全团的各级领导机构，提拔优秀正派的青年党员、团员到领导机关工作，并加强现有干部的训练与学习。
