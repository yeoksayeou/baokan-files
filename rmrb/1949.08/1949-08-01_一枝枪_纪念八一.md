    A Rifle
    ——In Memory of August 1st
    Fang Zhizhong
    (I) The Great Revolutionary Tide
    A Soviet-made Arisaka Type 38 rifle,
     Its body quite bulky,
     Small recoil when fired, high heat output;
     Sound: Ga—bang, bang!
     Its rhythm sends shivers down the enemy's spine;
     It was shipped from the Soviet Union before the "Oath-Taking Rally,"
     To help the Chinese people in the Northern Expedition!
     A great internationalist:
     Having seen through the reactionary essence of the Chiang bandits
     Early on from the "Zhongshan Warship" conspiracy (Note 1),
     It didn't hesitate, didn't delay,
     Departing from the goal of saving all mankind!
     I carried it:
     Climbed over the rugged Five Ridges,
     Endured the scorching summer heat.
     I used it:
     At the Leishui River in Hunan, and the Tingsiqiao Bridge in Hubei,
     Annihilated Wu Peifu's lackeys;
     I used it:
     In Gao'an and Nanchang, Jiangxi,
     Annihilated Sun Chuanfang's minions.
     I held it while eating during the day,
     I slept with it as my pillow at night,
     Later I was decorated,
     And then taken to the military hospital with it.
     "Military adventurism," "superstition of force," (Note 2)
     These criticisms were like satire,
     I put them aside;
     Because without a gun,
     It was as if life lacked security.
    (II) The Headwind of April 12th
     The weather changed, but no,
     What really changed was the Kuomintang
     ——Our regimental commander's face:
     Heavy with dark clouds,
     With a sinister aura.
     His curses were like thunderclaps,
     His temper like lightning.
     He seemed to have suddenly acquired supreme authority,
     Able to disrupt the constellation system!
     The regimental political instructor—our Party leader,
     Endured this arrogant conceit
     Silent but radiating boundless anger
     Several times I met him, hoping to gain some insight
     But shadows always flickered behind me
     Some "rumors" were actually facts,
     Who was arrested, who was secretly executed;
     The Chiang bandits massacred workers in Jiujiang,
     The "Wuhan faction" was also preparing to respond (Note 3)
     The air was filled with countless explosives,
     Ready to collapse heaven and earth at any moment.
     In my naive heart,
     There was only unwavering courage
     On the dark night of April 12th,
     Accused of being a "Communist,"
     The regimental political instructor and I were "sent off," (Note 4)
     I could even leave my hair behind,
     But wanted to take that Soviet-made Arisaka rifle
     But the company commander refused:
     "This is the order from above!"
     He also forgot,
     The life-saving grace at the Niuhang Railway Station. (Note 5)
     I caressed the smooth bolt,
     Finally shedding two clear tears:
     It seemed even bulkier,
     Unable to lift it anymore.
    (III) The Autumn Harvest Uprising
     The tyrant announced the killing budget:
     Official achievements to be tested with "red scores,"
     "Rather kill three thousand by mistake,
     Than let one escape;"
     Those with short haircuts were "rioters,"
     Those who had joined associations were called "bandit associates;"
     Those caught were executed on the spot,
     The relatives of those who fled were implicated.
     The blood of Communists and progressive elements,
     Dyed red the streets, alleys, remote villages!
     The fire of resistance,
     Although burning in the hearts of exiles,
     Yet spears, kitchen knives,
     Could not withstand foreign guns and cannons.
     I missed that Soviet-made Arisaka rifle
     Tears accompanied me across mountains and rivers;
     Finally, in a moment of inspiration,
     We came up with special equipment:
     Firecrackers loaded in anti-aircraft tree trunk tubes,
     Bamboo firecrackers in kerosene tanks,
     Besides hunting rifles, spears, and kitchen knives,
     We added these two new types of weapons
     Everyone didn't want to eat,
     Just wanted to breathe a sigh of relief as soon as possible.
     The night shifted toward tomorrow,
     People thought about tomorrow's victory;
     The stars in the autumn sky squinted and smiled
     People stepped happily at every step
     Like a torrent bursting a dam,
     Pouring towards the location of the National Defense Bureau:
     The assault team reached the enemy's sentry post,
     Kitchen knives found their use,
     The firecracker tank imitated the language of heavy machine guns,
     The tree trunk cannons played the roar of artillery,
     Hunting rifles took turns sticking out their long tongues,
     Gongs and drums mixed with people's shouts;
     The spear team and the scythe team swarmed up,
     The enemy surrendered in half an hour.
     Everyone got more than ten old muskets,
     I was also assigned a Browning pistol;
     From then on, we dared to
     Walk during the day and live in houses at night;
     From then on, our struggle had guns!
     Tit for tat,
     Gun for gun!
     A single spark, finally grew and spread;
     Burning down the Chiang bandit dynasty,
     Shining brightly in the East.
    Appendix:
    (1) On March 20, 1926, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Zhongshan Warship to advance towards Huangpu in Guangdong, falsely accusing our Party of wanting to surround the Huangpu Military Academy, and immediately arrested and imprisoned Soviet advisors and our Party comrades.
    (2) Under the opportunist leadership of Chen Duxiu, any Party members who focused on military work were criticized as "military adventurists" or "superstitious of force."
    (3) The Wuhan National Government, headed by Wang Jingwei and claiming to be the left wing of the Kuomintang, was called the "Wuhan faction." At that time, the final split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was imminent.
    (4) Because of our past conscientiousness in work and friendly unity with colleagues, it was inconvenient to arrest us, so we had to be expelled by "seeing us off."
    (5) Niuhang Railway Station is the first station of the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway outside Nanchang city. The company commander was injured and I rescued him, but I was also decorated because of this.

    一枝枪
    ——纪念八一
    方之中
    （一）大革命浪潮
    一枝苏造三八，
     身体很笨重，
     打起来坐力小，放热大；
     响声：嘎——砰，砰！
     带着节奏使敌胆战肉麻；
     它是“誓师”前苏联运来，
     帮助中国人民北伐！
     伟大的国际主义者：
     早从“中山舰”阴谋中（注一）
     看清了蒋匪们的反动本质，
     它毫不计较，不迟疑，
     从拯救全人类出发！
     我带着它：
     爬过崎岖的五岭，
     熬过火热的暑天。
     我用它：
     在湖南泪罗江，湖北汀泗桥，
     消灭了吴佩孚的走卒；
     我用它：
     在江西的高安、南昌，
     消灭了孙传芳的喽罗。
     白天我抱着它吃饭，
     夜晚我枕着它睡眠，
     随后我挂了花，
     又带着它进了伤兵医院。
     “军事投机”，“迷信武力”，（注二）
     这批评等于讽刺，
     我都置之度外；
     因为少了枪
     仿佛生命缺少了保障。
    （二）四·一二的逆风
     天变了，但是不，
     真变了的是国民党
     ——我们团长的脸：
     有浓重的黑云，
     有阴森的煞气。
     骂声象炸雷，
     性子象闪电。
     他象突然取得了无上威权，
     可以搅乱星辰的体系！
     团指导员——我党领导者，
     忍受着这种狂妄的骄横
     静默中却流出无比愤怒
     几次见面我想得点启示
     然我背后老闪烁着人影
     有些“谣言”却又是事实，
     谁又被捕，谁已暗地处死；
     蒋匪在九江惨杀工人，
     “武汉派”也准备响应（注三）
     空气里埋着无数炸药，
     任何时都可炸塌天地。
     在我幼稚心灵上，
     仅有着坚贞不屈的勇气
     就在四一二的黑夜里，
     加上“共党”罪名，
     我和团政指被“欢送”出来了，（注四）
     我连头发都可留下，
     但要带走那支苏造三八
     连长却拒绝：
     “这是上级的命令！”
     他也忘记了，
     牛行车站的救命大恩。（注五）
     我抚摸着光滑的机柄，
     最后地淌下两点清泪：
     它显得更笨重了，
     再也拿它不动。
    （三）秋收暴动
     暴君公布了杀人预算：
     作官成绩要用“赤字”考验，
     “宁可错杀三千，
     不准遗漏一人；”
     剪分头的为“暴徒”，
     入过会的叫“会匪”；
     捉到的就地枪决，
     逃亡的亲属株连。
     共产党员和进步分子的鲜血，
     染红了大街小巷、僻壤荒乡！
     反抗的怒火，
     虽在流亡者心上燃烧，
     可是梭镖、菜刀，
     敌不过洋枪快炮。
     我想念着那支苏造三八
     眼泪伴着我走遍山巅水涯；
     终于急中生智，
     我们想出了特殊装备：
     防空树筒罐火药，
     爆竹装入火油箱，
     除开猎枪、梭标、菜刀外，
     又添了这两种新式武器
     大家有饭不想吃，
     总想早日吐一口气。
     夜向着明天转移，
     人想着明天胜利；
     秋空的星子眯着眼微笑
     人们每一步都踏着欢喜
     有如决堤的狂流，
     倾泻地奔向国防局所在地：
     冲锋队摸到敌人哨棚，
     菜刀找到了用武之地，
     爆竹箱学着重机枪的语言，
     树筒炮扮着大炮的怒吼，
     猎枪轮番地伸出长舌，
     锣鼓杂着人底呐喊；
     梭镖队、大镰队蜂拥而上，
     半小时敌即投降。
     大伙得到十余支老套筒，
     我也分到一支勃朗宁手枪；
     从此我们敢于
     白天走路，夜间住房；
     从此我们斗争有了枪！
     以牙还牙，
     以枪对枪！
     星星之火，终于发扬滋长；
     烧毁了蒋匪皇朝，
     灿烂地照耀东方。
    附注：
    （一）一九二六年三月二十日蒋匪诡令中山舰向广东黄埔进发，诬指我党想包围黄埔军校，当即捕押苏联顾问及我党同志。
    （二）在陈独秀机会主义领导下，凡党员着重军事工作者，即加以“军事投机”或“迷信武力”等批评。
    （三）以汪精卫为首自称国民党左派的武汉国民政府称为“武汉派”，当时国共行将最后破裂。
    （四）由于我们过去对工作的认真负责，对同事的友好团结，未便加以逮捕，只好用“欢送”来驱逐我们。
    （五）牛行车站是南昌城外南浔铁路之首站，连长受伤是我抢救的，然我亦因此挂了花。
