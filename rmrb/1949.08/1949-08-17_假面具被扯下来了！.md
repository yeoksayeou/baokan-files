　　The Mask is Torn Off!
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th] TASS, Moscow, 13th: The Truth newspaper published an editorial entitled "The Mask is Torn Off!", commenting on the Soviet government's reply to the Yugoslav government's note on the Slovene Carinthia issue. The editorial stated: The Soviet government's reply exposed the roots of the Yugoslav government's policy of blackmail and deception against the Yugoslav people. The Yugoslav government has abandoned the camp of democracy and socialism and attached itself to the camp of foreign capitalists and reactionaries. The Soviet reply completely exposed the Tito, Djilas, Kardelj, and Ranković group, who are firmly attached to the imperialist bloc and are carrying out a brazen anti-Soviet slander campaign to cater to the wishes of the imperialist bloc. The Yugoslav government, on the one hand, is carrying out plans to abandon Slovene Carinthia and is trying to collude with Western countries, and on the other hand, is playing a double game with the Soviet Union. The Yugoslav government is selling out the interests of Slovene Carinthia and the national interests of Yugoslavia; at the same time, it is trying to create the false impression in the minds of the Yugoslav people that it continues to insist on its original demand to transfer Slovene Carinthia to Yugoslavia, intending to pretend that Yugoslavia is the defender of the rights of Slovene Carinthia. However, this plan completely failed. The many facts listed in the Soviet government's reply convincingly prove the failure of the Yugoslav government's ugly conspiracy. The Yugoslav government is secretly colluding with representatives of foreign capitalists at the expense of the interests of Carinthian Slovenes and to the detriment of Yugoslavia's national interests. It is trying to deceive its own people and the democratic public around the world with lies and slanders. As a result of secret talks with representatives of Western countries, the Yugoslav government no longer insists on its demands for Slovene Carinthia and is trying to deceive the Slovenian people. This deception by the Yugoslav government has also been completely exposed. Truth Newspaper said: The Soviet government has drawn conclusions from these facts, the special significance of which is reflected in the conclusion of the Soviet note: "Let the Yugoslav people know that the Soviet government considers the current Yugoslav government not a friend and ally of the Soviet Union, but an enemy and opponent of the Soviet Union."

　　假面具被扯下来了！
    【新华社北平十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：真理报以“假面具被扯下来了”为题发表社论，评论苏联政府对南斯拉夫政府关于斯洛文族加林西亚问题照会的复文。社论说：苏联政府的复文揭露了南斯拉夫政府所采取的讹诈与欺骗南斯拉夫人民的政策的根源。南斯拉夫政府背弃了民主与社会主义的阵营，而依附于外国资本家与反动派的阵营。苏联复文完全揭露了铁托、德热拉斯、卡德尔和兰科维奇集团，他们牢固地依附于帝国主义集团，并迎合着帝国主义集团的意旨而进行放肆的反苏毁谤运动。南斯拉夫政府一方面进行着放弃斯洛文族加林西亚的计划，并努力与西方国家勾搭，另一方面又对苏联玩弄其两面政策。南斯拉夫政府出卖着斯洛文族加林西亚的利益和南斯拉夫的民族利益；同时又试图在南斯拉夫人民的心目中制造错误的印象：即所谓它继续坚持其将斯洛文族加林西亚转交南斯拉夫的原来要求，意图装作南斯拉夫是斯洛文族加林西亚权利的保卫者。然而，这个计划完全失败了。苏联政府复文所列举的许多事实，令人心服地证明了南斯拉夫政府丑恶的阴谋诡计的失败。南斯拉夫政府以加林西亚斯洛文族的利益为代价，并且损害着南斯拉夫的民族利益，而与外国资本家代表们秘密地狼狈为奸。它试图以谎骗与诽谤来瞒过它自己的人民和全世界的民主公众。和西方国家的代表们秘密商谈的结果，使南斯拉夫政府不再坚持对斯洛文族加林西亚的要求，并试图欺骗斯南拉夫人民。南斯拉夫政府的这种欺骗，也同样被完全揭露了。真理报说：苏联政府从这些事实中得到了结论，这些结论的特别意义表现在苏联照会的结论中：“让南斯拉夫人民知道：苏联政府认为南斯拉夫现政府，不是苏联的朋友与同盟者，而是苏联的敌人与反对者。”
