    British Imperialists Persecute Progressive Individuals in Hong Kong
    Shanghai Literary and Art Circles Strongly Protest
    [Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station Broadcast] Shanghai literary and art figures have expressed extreme indignation at the Hong Kong British government's series of unreasonable actions persecuting progressive individuals and suppressing public opinion. Literary writers Feng Xuefeng, Hu Feng, Ba Jin, Jin Yi, Zhang Junxiang, Xu Jie, Feng Yidai, Mei Lin, Wei Jinzhi, Zheng Junli, Zhao Dan, Shi Hui, Tang Tao, Qu Chu, Tao Dun, Mu Ye, and others have all issued statements, issuing a serious warning to the British government. They unanimously stated: The Chinese people's cause of liberation is an incomparably solemn historical mission. No force can resist it, and there is no price to be bargained. The policies now adopted by the British imperialists will backfire. That will not only arouse the anger of the Chinese people, but it will also certainly arouse the anger of the vast number of peace-loving people in Britain.

    英帝迫害香港进步人士
    沪文艺界严重抗议
    【上海人民广播电台广播】上海文艺界人士对香港英政府一连串迫害进步人士，压制人民舆论的无理行动，表示极度愤慨。文艺作家冯雪峰、胡风、巴金、靳以、张骏祥、许杰、冯亦代、梅林、魏金枝、郑君里、赵丹、石挥、唐韬、屈楚、陶碓、牧野等都发表谈话，向英政府提出严重的警告。一致表示：中国人民解放事业是无比庄严的历史使命。没有任何力量可以抵抗，没有任何价钱可讲。英帝现在所采取的政策，要自食其果，那不但会引起中国人民的愤怒，而且也一定会引起英国爱好和平广大人民的愤怒的。
