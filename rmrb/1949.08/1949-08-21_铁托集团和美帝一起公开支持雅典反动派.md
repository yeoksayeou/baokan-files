　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th: The Tito clique, openly and together with the United States, is actively assisting the Greek royalist fascists in their fight against the democratic army. According to a TASS dispatch from Athens, the Yugoslav Chargé d'affaires in Greece, Martinovic, held a long meeting with the Permanent Under-Secretary of the Greek Foreign Ministry, Pipimoulis, on the 17th. This meeting aroused great interest here, because until recently, the diplomatic personnel of the Yugoslav Embassy always avoided visiting representatives of the Athens government, even for courtesy visits. Newspaper reports and headlines emphasized that this was the first official contact between the Yugoslav Embassy and the Greek Foreign Ministry since Yugoslav Ambassador Tankar was recalled home almost three years ago. According to the newspapers Eleftheria, Akropolis, and Embros, "the meeting discussed issues related to the changed relations between the two countries." Diplomatic figures assessed Martinovic's meeting with Pipimoulis as "the first formal step towards establishing friendly relations between the governments of Greece and Yugoslavia." At the same time, the United States is strengthening its aid to the royalist fascists. The US aircraft carrier Sicily delivered 49 new US-made bombers to Greece and handed them over to representatives of the Greek Air Force. According to a report from the United Press, the director of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, Hoffman, flew to Athens from Rome on the 18th.

　　铁托集团和美帝一起公开支持雅典反动派
    【新华社北平二十日电】铁托集团公开地和美国一起，积极援助希腊保皇法西斯对民主军作战。据塔斯社雅典讯，南斯拉夫驻希代办马蒂诺维区，十七日与希腊外交部常务次长比比幕利斯进行长时间的会谈。这次会谈引起此间莫大兴趣，因为直到最近，南斯拉夫大使馆外交人员，总是回避访问雅典政府的代表，即使是礼节性的访问。报纸的消息和标题均强调指出：这是差不多三年前南斯拉夫大使唐卡尔被召回国以来，南斯拉夫大使馆和希腊外交部第一次的正式接触。据爱列夫底里亚、阿克罗波利斯、恩布罗斯等报纸称，“会谈中曾讨论有关两国间已经改变了的关系问题”。外交人士把马蒂诺维区与比比幕利斯的会谈，估价为“建立希南两国政府的友好关系的第一个正式的步骤”。同时，美国正加强对保皇法西斯的援助，美国航空母舰西西里号把四十九架美造新轰炸机运抵希腊，交给希腊空军的代表。另据合众社透露：美国的经合总署署长霍夫曼十八日已由罗马乘机飞抵雅典。
