    Railway Employees Brave Rain to Rush Repairs
    (Baoding Dispatch) Railway employees from various factories and sections in Baoding are actively rushing to repair the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section of the Pinghan Railway. The workers put forward the slogan, "Fight against wind and rain!" Regardless of the continuous wind and rain, they worked with enthusiasm and challenged each other. The workers repairing the road, the small transport team workers, those carrying splints and distributing road spikes in the front, the workers carrying road timbers immediately followed; those lifting steel rails guaranteed not to drop them; those hammering road spikes would hammer them as soon as the front splints were in place, and their morale was extremely high. On the 12th, they braved the heavy rain to rush the repairs. The telecommunications engineering team repaired the electric poles and automatically used short poles to make two hundred and fifty-nine connecting poles, overcoming the difficulty of a lack of materials. The electric pole measuring team and the digging team greatly improved their efficiency. The electric poles have now been erected to Wangdu Station.
