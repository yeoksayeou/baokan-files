Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, August 21st: TASS Washington, August 19th: The US government's plan to supply arms to the North Atlantic Treaty nations suffered a serious setback in the House of Representatives. In a vote on the 18th, the House cut the appropriation by half. Congressional sources pointed out that the result of this vote was a serious blow to the government and showed that the traditional "bipartisan foreign policy" had been "obstructed." Republican congressional leaders who often support the government's foreign policy advocated cutting the government's plan. A significant number of Democratic members also followed the lead of the Republican members. It should be noted that appropriations for Greece, Turkey, South Korea, and the Philippines were passed without amendment. Democratic member Richards and Republican member Vorys also joined the group opposing the government. Under Richards's initial advocacy, the House of Representatives defeated the government's proposed appropriation of $75 million in cash by a vote of 209 to 151. Subsequently, the House also rejected a clause in the government bill that would have authorized the government to enter into agreements to allocate weapons worth a total of $505 million by a vote of 123 to 73. Thus, only half of the original plan to allocate $1,161 million to supply weapons to Western European countries was approved. In addition, the House also rejected an amendment authorizing the President to "conduct negotiations to acquire bases on the territory of friendly nations." Two amendments requesting appropriations of $75 million to the Kuomintang government and $25 million to "non-Communist areas of Southeast Asia" were also rejected. In the vote on the last two amendments, 164 voted against and 92 voted in favor. Most significantly, even for this already reduced plan to arm the Atlantic Pact, 122 voted against it, with only 238 in favor. Commenting on the results of the House vote, newspapers said that the government had lost its control over the House. Disregarding Speaker Rayburn's call for members to listen to the opinions of the military (who said that $1.45 billion was the minimum appropriation necessary to begin rearming the Atlantic Pact nations), the House still passed the arms reduction plan. Newspapers continued to say that the government is now placing all its hopes on the Senate committee continuing to discuss the arms bill. The failure of the government's plan in the House of Representatives truly reflects the widespread dissatisfaction of American voters with the government's policy of engaging in aggressive military alliances and arms races.

　　美众院削减援外拨款一半
  　反映了选民普遍不满政府侵略政策
    【新华社北平二十一日电】塔斯社华盛顿十九日讯：美国政府以军备供给北大西洋公约国家的计划，在众院受到严重的挫败，该院十八日表决的结果，削减了拨款的一半。国会方面指出：这种表决的结果使政府受到严重的打击，并且显示出传统的“两党一致的外交政策”，受到“阻碍”。经常支持政府外交政策的共和党国会领袖，主张削减政府计划。相当大的一部分民主党议员也追随共和党议员的路线。须要指出的是：供给希腊、土耳其、南朝鲜和菲律宾的拨款是毫无修改地通过了。民主党议员李查兹和共和党议员伏利斯也参加在反对政府的一群里。在李查兹率先倡导之下，众议院以二百零九票对一百五十一票击败政府所建议的七千五百万元现金的拨款。接着，众院又以一百二十三票对七十三票否决了政府法案中要求授权政府签订协定，以拨出总值达五亿零五百万元武器的条款。这样，原来要求拨款十一亿六千一百万元以武器供给西欧国家的计划，只有一半被批准。此外，众院还否决了一修正案，即授权总统“进行在友邦领土上取得基地”的谈判。要求拨款七千五百万元给国民党政府和二千五百万元给“东南亚非共产党区域”的两件修正案也被否决了。在表决最后两件修正案中，投反对票者一百六十四人，投赞成票者九十二人。最有意义的是：就是对于这样已被削减的武装大西洋公约的计划，也有一百二十二人投反对票，赞成者仅有二百三十八票。各报在评论众院的表决结果时称：政府已经丧失了它对于众院的控制。众院不顾议长雷朋要求议员听从军人意见（他们说，十四亿五千万元是开始重新武装大西洋公约国家所必需的最低限度拨款）的呼吁，仍然通过了削减军备计划。报纸继称：政府现在把希望完全寄托在继续讨论军备法案的参院委员会上。政府计划在众院中的失败，确实反映了美国选民对于政府进行侵略性的军事联盟和军备竞赛的政策，普遍不满。
