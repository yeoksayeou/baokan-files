　　At the Party
    Guo Maolin
    The news that the summer workers' school would hold a party on Saturday had been announced a couple of days ago. The Propaganda Department had also put up a notice announcing the schedule and program. The workers kept saying, "I want to participate!" But unfortunately, it started to rain that afternoon. We couldn't meet on the playground, and the room wasn't big enough to seat many people, so some people began to hesitate, wondering if the meeting would even take place today. But the calls to proceed came one after another, "Set it up! We must hold it!" "Don't be afraid of the rain!" The workers from the water and electricity department immediately started working. At this moment, everyone was very determined. They connected the wires, the marching music began to play, and the red calico was hung up, with the words "Summer Workers' School Party" written on it. Large portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu were hung high, they looked kindly at the workers who were attending the meeting in the rain. People entered the courtyard one after another, excitedly smiling, shaking hands, and talking. The seventeen university students who came to work in this factory also came, saying their final goodbyes to the workers. Some were still asking about problems with their studies, showing boundless kindness. The hands of students and workers were tightly clasped together, their voices resounding together.
    The chairman used short sentences to express his gratitude to the enthusiastic students, saying, "The great unity of workers and students," has finally been realized today. This is thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party and the liberation of the oppressed people. Workers and students have both learned new knowledge from each other, which is the harvest of learning. But we must not be proud, and we must continue to carry out regularized learning in a planned way in the future. Representative Jia said: "We don't want to give the teachers anything; the gift we give them is to do our jobs well, establish a correct attitude towards labor, and abide by labor discipline." Old worker Comrade Lu Mao said, "I represent the worker comrades to salute the students!" A round of applause followed his raised right hand. Comrade Shi Guang, the representative of the students, took the stage, his loud voice resounding throughout the courtyard. He said, "We sincerely accept the gift from the worker comrades, because stepping up production is what the Chinese people need!" He continued, "Today we can be with the worker comrades, we should thank the Communist Party and thank Chairman Mao!" Look, two worker representatives excitedly started talking, one said: "Before, I only knew that Liu Bowen created Beijing, now I know that labor created the world and also created man, labor is sacred! I didn't know why democracy still needs dictatorship before, but now I know that it is democracy for the people and dictatorship for the reactionaries." One said: "Now it's preliminary learning, and we must continue to learn in the future! Learn!" Everyone listening was interested, pricking up their ears to listen, with bursts of applause and laughter. More and more people came, and the courtyard and under the trees were full, and the rain became lighter.
    Following a clapperdike performance by Li Wenhua, there were Peking opera excerpts, a large yangko dance, music, crosstalk, and a double act. Finally, the seventeen students sang "Great Production" together. As soon as the conductor stopped conducting, "One more!" A student took the stage to conduct the whole audience in singing "Happy Labor," "The furnace is red, fire..."
    The meeting ended, and under the lights, some people were reluctant to leave, shaking hands again, "Welcome students to come to the factory often!" "Welcome comrades to come to our school too!" The comradeship of the past month was concentrated in this harmonious and joyful party tonight, and the more concrete gains will be actively reflected in production and learning.

　　联欢会上
    郭茂林
    暑期工人学校星期六举行联欢会的消息，前两天就喊出去了，宣教部也贴出了布告，公布了程序和节目。工友们都念叨着：“我要去参加！”谁知道真不凑巧，这天下午蒙蒙的下起雨来了。在操场上不能开会了，屋子里又坐不下几个人，有人开始犹豫，会，今天开不开呢！但是催促的声音一次一次的传出来，“布置吧！我们一定要开！”“不怕雨！”水电部的工友们立即开始工作了，这时候，大家都是十分坚决的，接上电线，进行曲开始响起来，红彩布挂起来，上面写着：“暑期工人学校联欢会。”毛主席和朱总司令的大幅画像高高地挂起，他们慈祥地凝视着冒雨开会的工友们。人们一个跟着一个进到院子里，兴奋地露着笑容，相互握手，谈话。那十七位到本厂工作的大学同学也都来了，和工友们作着最后的话别，有的还在询问着功课上的问题，这里表现出无限的亲切。学生和工人们的手紧握在一起，声音响在一起。
    主席用简短话句向热心服务的同学们表示感谢，他说：“工人学生大团结”这句话，今天终于实现了。这是由于共产党的领导，由于被压迫的人民解放了。工人和同学互相之间都学得了新的知识，这就是学习的收获。但不能骄傲，今后要继续有计划地进行正规化的学习。贾代表说：“我们不要送给老师们什么东西，我们送给他们的礼物，就是把工作搞好，建立起正确的劳动态度，遵守劳动纪律。”老工人路懋同志说：“我代表工人同志向同学们致礼！”随着他举起来的右手响起了一片掌声。同学们的代表时光同志上台了，宏亮的嗓子，声音震动了整个院子。他说：“我们诚恳地接受了工友同志们送给我们的礼物，因为加紧生产是中国人民的需要！”继续说：“今天我们能和工人同志在一起，我们应该感谢共产党感谢毛主席！”看吧，两个工人代表兴奋地讲起来了，一个说：“以前我只知道刘伯温创造北京城，现在我才知道劳动创造了世界，也创造了人，劳动是神圣的！先前不知道为什么民主还要专政呢？现在知道对人民是民主的对反动派是专政的。”一个说：“现在是初步学习，今后还要继续学习！学习！”听的都感兴趣，竖起耳朵听着，一阵鼓掌，一阵笑。人，越来越多，院子里树底下都站满了，雨也小了。
    在李文华的一段快板之后，是平剧清唱、大秧歌舞、音乐、相声、双簧。最后由十七位同学合唱“大生产”歌，指挥者刚停止指挥，“再来一个！”一位同学上台指挥全体全会场的人们齐唱“愉快的劳动”，“炉火通红，火……”
    散会了，灯光下面有的人恋恋不舍，又来一次握手，“欢迎同学们常到工厂里来”！“欢迎同志也到我们学校里去”！一个月来的同志友爱，集中表现在今晚这个和谐愉快的联欢会上，更具体的收获，将积极地表现在生产上，学习上。
