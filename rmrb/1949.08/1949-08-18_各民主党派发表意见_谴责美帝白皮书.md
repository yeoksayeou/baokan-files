The democratic parties have expressed their opinions, condemning the American imperialist White Paper.

[This Newspaper’s Dispatch] After American imperialism released its "White Paper," it aroused unanimous anger and condemnation from the Chinese people. Mr. Li Jishen and Ms. Li Dequan of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Ma Xulun of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Peng Zemin of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Xu Deheng of the September 3rd Society, Hu Yuzhi of the China National Salvation Association, Tan Pingshan of the Three People's Principles Comrades Association, Cai Tingkai of the Chinese Kuomintang Democratic Promotion Association, and Chen Qiyou of the China Zhi Gong Party have all issued statements, denouncing American imperialism for consistently being the enemy of the Chinese people and exposing its conspiracies and tricks to sabotage the Chinese people's democratic revolution in the future (the Democratic League's statement will be published separately). The statements are as follows:

Li Jishen
Solemnly Warn American Imperialism
Conspiracies Inevitably Fail

The U.S. State Department's "White Paper on Sino-U.S. Relations," released on the 5th of this month, although we have not yet seen its full picture, from the summary documents alone, we can clearly see that (1) American imperialism has exhausted all kinds of methods to aid and support the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek government, attempting to control China, enslave the Chinese people, and use it as an anti-communist and anti-democratic appendage, while hypocritically saying: "Support China's unity and territorial integrity," thinking it could deceive the world and cover up its crimes; but in the end, the reactionary government it supported was so "corrupt and incompetent," "unworthy of support," that in the end, it had to frankly confess in this "euphemistically plaintive" and helpless confession, exposing its ferocious face to the people of the world. (2) Although American imperialism's aid to Chiang has reached a hopeless situation today, its tricks to sabotage the Chinese revolution will not end. Isn't Acheson admitting it? "All forces within China that oppose the development of popular democracy that has already been achieved today will be encouraged by the United States." Doesn't this mean that even if the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government completely collapses, it will definitely continue to use various methods to "support" or "encourage" other evil forces to oppose and sabotage the people's regime? We solemnly warn you—American imperialists, your plan will inevitably fail. Has the strength of the Chinese people reached today, dealing with the tricks and conspiracies of the imperialists, still become a problem? However, we must raise our vigilance. We must use action to respond to the tricks and conspiracies of the imperialists. (3) American imperialism has forgotten its own "tail" but loudly shouts that the Soviet Union is imperialism, slandering the Chinese Communist Party as "serving the interests of foreign imperialists." Facts speak louder than words. May I ask, in the three years of the people's war against the people in China, has the Soviet Union interfered in China's internal affairs like you, American imperialism? Has it helped the People's Liberation Army with money and weapons like you, American imperialism, helped Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government? What is the fact that the CCP "serves the interests of foreign imperialists"? Can you give an example? These shameless and rogue lies are simply self-defeating, which corresponds to the Chinese saying "hypocrisy is self-defeating." Although the White Paper has more than a thousand pages, it is just "a page full of absurd words."

Ma Xulun
The White Paper is a Record of American Imperialism's Crimes of Sabotaging China Over the Years

The U.S. Secretary of State Acheson has released the White Paper. Although on the surface it abandons the Kuomintang reactionary group, in fact, American imperialism is turning to another direction, trying to use various methods to sabotage our people's revolutionary front. In my opinion, the strength of American imperialism is very weak compared to the strength of the Chinese people. It will ultimately fail; but we must raise our vigilance. First of all, we must unite and defeat its conspiracies and tricks. American imperialism also wants to use Chinese liberal intellectuals to sabotage us. They think that China's construction cannot succeed without them. If we unite and work hard to build a new China, we will never let American imperialism have any chance to carry out its tricks. The American imperialist White Paper, as the Xinhua News Agency editorial said, is a "helpless confession," a record of American imperialism's crimes of sabotaging China and turning it into a colony over the years. We Chinese people should give it a punishment; at the same time, it strengthens the unity of the Chinese people and gives those who always think that American imperialism has good intentions a strong lesson. The Chinese people will definitely know how to deal with American imperialism.

Expose All New Conspiracies of American Imperialism
Unite to Fight to the End

Peng Zemin
The recent publication of the "White Paper on Sino-U.S. Relations" by American imperialism fully exposes its consistent aggression against our country, interference in our internal affairs, and the towering crimes of supporting Chinese reactionaries in massacring the Chinese people. From Hurley and Marshall to Wedemeyer, they were all practical executors of American imperialism's great conspiracy of aggression. From Hurley onwards, their use of hypocritical masks to cover up their attacks on the Chinese people has been consistent, and each time it has been more brutal and vicious than the last. The publication of this "White Paper" is precisely the confession of the complete failure of American imperialism's great conspiracy in China, just like the mournful cries of a greedy beast after being hit head-on. But even today, this beast is still "reluctant to give up until the Yellow River is reached," and still uses its hypocritical face to cover up and carry out the last great conspiracy in the "White Paper," attempting to deceive the Chinese people, the American people, and even the people of the world. Therefore, today we should expose all the new conspiracies of American imperialism. The Chinese people, the American people, and even the peace-loving people of the world, must raise their vigilance and face up to the arrogant actions of American imperialism that endanger world peace. Unite to "discard illusions, prepare for struggle." Chairman Mao instructed us to "lean to one side," firmly stand on the side of the peace-loving and free democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, and vow to fight to the end against American imperialism, which hates the Chinese people and invades the people of the world.

American Imperialism Vainly Attempts to Find Another Tool to Replace the Chiang Gang
This Conspiracy is Undoubtedly Doomed to Failure

Xu Deheng
Today, when the cause of the Chinese people's liberation is about to achieve victory on a national scale, the U.S. State Department has published a White Paper on its China policy. This is not only to shirk the responsibility for the great mistakes made in its foreign policy, but also contains a more sinister conspiracy to invade China than before. The Chiang Kai-shek military comprador fascist bureaucratic group is on the verge of complete destruction and is no longer sufficient to be the main tool of American imperialists. It vainly attempts to find another tool to replace the Chiang group. This attempt is undoubtedly doomed to failure. In the eyes of the Chinese people, the American imperialists and Chiang bandits are no different from the Japanese imperialists and Wang Jingwei, and even worse than them. If the American reactionary government still seeks reactionary elements like Chiang Kai-shek to obstruct the cause of the Chinese people's liberation, it will surely arouse greater anger from the Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world. Chiang Kai-shek is the most reactionary warlord in China, and he has already failed, let alone the others.

In recent years, Chiang Kai-shek dared to launch a crazy civil war entirely due to the support and encouragement of American imperialism. The American White Paper has clearly admitted this fact. Now, although the Chiang regime has completely collapsed, American imperialists still provide massive support with military supplies, airplanes, and money, indiscriminately bombing cities and blockading coastal ports. At the same time, behind the scenes, they instruct puppets such as Chiang Kai-shek, Quirino, and Syngman Rhee to carry out their anti-communist and anti-Soviet conspiracies. These facts will never be forgotten by the Chinese people. We have always cherished the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American people and resolutely demand that the American people stop such atrocities by the American reactionary government.

Hu Yuzhi
The Chinese People's Strength is Great; American Imperialism's Wishful Thinking Will Fail

After releasing the White Paper, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson made a statement to reporters, in which he said: "American policy cannot be based on illusions and wishful thinking." That's absolutely right. American imperialism has a set of wishful thinking about China. That is, on the one hand, it uses U.S. dollars, airplanes, and cannons to supply the reactionary heads of China to massacre the Chinese people, and on the other hand, it buys off some spineless intellectuals, the so-called liberal intellectuals or democratic individualists, to deceive the Chinese people, so that the Chinese people can obediently be slaves and docile people of American imperialism, and China will become the second Philippines. Who knew that this calculation was not accurate. Most of the U.S. aid weapons fell into the hands of the People's Liberation Army, and the reactionary heads could no longer be supported. Even the liberal intellectuals that American imperialism placed endless hopes on, except for a few scum like Hu Shi and Wong Wenhao, have also betrayed the American masters and flocked to the people's side. American imperialism's wishful thinking has completely failed. Why did it fail? Because the Chinese people have stood up. Imperialism is originally the best at calculating, but it can never estimate the strength of the people, so in the end, it always fails. Although it now understands that it made the wrong wishful calculation in the past, it will definitely make another set of wishful calculations in the future. Because imperialism doesn't understand anything other than calculating. We Chinese people, especially intellectuals, if we want to calculate with imperialism, we will lose. But if the people take out their fists to deal with imperialism's wishful thinking, not only will we not lose, but we will win steadily.

Tan Pingshan
Solemnly Defend the Democratic Revolutionary Camp and Oppose American Imperialism's Destructive Conspiracy

The U.S. government, in violation of the will of the Chinese people and the rights and interests of the Chinese nation, helps the reactionary government hated by the Chinese people themselves, massacring the Chinese people. The Chinese people have suffered deeply from this. The Chinese people have long had a deep understanding of the ferocious truth of American imperialism, its conspiracy to interfere in China's internal affairs, and its attempt to enslave the Chinese people. The so-called "White Paper on Sino-U.S. Relations" published by the U.S. State Department on the 5th of this month is just a kind of confession by American imperialism itself. But in this 1,054-page White Paper and U.S. Secretary of State Acheson's statement, we know even more that America's policy of aggression and conspiracy to interfere in China's internal affairs will not change because it has encountered various failures. On the contrary, precisely because of the disastrous defeat of American imperialism's aggressive policy, precisely because they feel the threat of the victory of the Chinese revolution, they will continue to interfere in China's internal affairs more blatantly and constantly, and sabotage the Chinese people's liberation cause. We Chinese people should be vigilant. We can clearly see the conspiracy of the five principles in Acheson's statement of August 6 to be hostile to the Chinese people. Even so, American imperialism's exhausted tricks are nothing more than this. The Xinhua News Agency's paper on New Year's Day this year has clearly revealed its conspiracy, which is to create a so-called "opposition" in the democratic camp. Our countermeasure is to strengthen the unity of democratic forces, solemnly defend the democratic revolutionary camp, consolidate and expand the democratic united front, especially to firmly stand on the anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union, and work hand in hand with democratic and peace forces around the world to fight together.

Li Dequan
Crush American Imperialism's Vicious Attempt to Attack the Chinese People

The victory of the Chinese revolution is the biggest defeat of the imperialist bloc, especially American imperialism, in the East. Acheson's White Paper completely exposes how American imperialists attacked the Chinese people through the tool of Chiang Kai-shek and failed. But American imperialism is still not reconciled and still uses its ferocious face to attack the Chinese people with all kinds of vicious methods. American imperialism, you should give up and bow your head to the Chinese people! How can the strength of the Chinese people today be conquered by you selfish imperialists? The liberated Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party are definitely not the ignorant people of the reactionary Chiang regime era. The Chinese people have realized that only by adhering to the policy of the people's democratic dictatorship and working hard to build a new democratic China can the Chinese people be happy; only by standing on the side of the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union can the people of the whole world be happy.

Cai Tingkai
The People of the Whole Country Will Surely Unite to Completely Smash the Conspiracy of American Imperialism

Since the publication of the American White Paper, all of our country's democratic parties, people's organizations, and the working class, peasants, and masses have been united against the enemy and have a deeper understanding of the ferocious face of American imperialism. It will only make the People's Liberation Army, who are bravely fighting the enemy on the front lines, even more enthusiastic and brave to move forward, attack Hainan Island, attack Taiwan, and completely eliminate the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, the running dogs of American imperialism!

American imperialism knows that the Kuomintang reactionary faction is the most incompetent, most corrupt, most reactionary group that does not receive the support of the Chinese people. However, it insists on helping this group to be the enemy of the Chinese people. The purpose is to turn China into a Quirino and Syngman Rhee-style puppet government in order to enslave the Chinese people and make China a complete colony of American imperialism!

In the irretrievable and dying reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, American imperialism still wants to use some "democratic individualists" to organize anti-communist factions in an attempt to overthrow the Chinese people's democratic regime. That's really a dream! It must be known that the Chinese people have awakened today. Especially under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the whole of China will surely unite to completely smash the conspiracy of American imperialism!

Chen Qiyou
The Chinese People Have the Confidence to Repel American Imperialism's Aggression

After the publication of the American White Paper, I have four opinions: First, I think American imperialism wants to cover up its aggression against China, but it fully exposes its face. Second, American imperialism pushes the crime of the Chiang gang massacring the people and launching a civil war entirely on Chiang Kai-shek, but in fact, it has consistently directed it from behind. Third, the White Paper says that there is an imperialism behind the people's regime. In fact, the imperialism is the United States, which supports the Kuomintang reactionary regime. But the Chinese people are anti-imperialist and stand with the international peace front to fight against imperialism. Fourth, American imperialism has failed to support Chiang Kai-shek. It wants to continue to deceive the Chinese people, change its appearance, and use so-called "democratic individual liberalists" to support anti-people's governments, but our people are confident in eliminating all reactionaries and repelling American imperialism's aggressive actions against us.

### 各民主党派发表意见　谴责美帝白皮书

专栏：

　　各民主党派发表意见
  　谴责美帝白皮书
    【本报讯】美帝发表“白皮书”后，引起中国人民一致的愤怒和谴责。中国国民党革命委员会李济深及李德全先生、中国民主促进会马叙伦、中国农工民主党彭泽民、九三学社许德珩、中国人民救国会胡愈之、三民主义同志联合会谭平山、中国国民党民主促进会蔡廷锴、中国致公党陈其尤等纷纷发表谈话，指斥美帝始终与中国人民为敌，并揭露其今后破坏中国人民民主革命的阴谋诡计（民主同盟谈话另行发表）。谈话如下：
    李济深
    正告美帝国主义
  　阴谋必然失败
    美国国务院在本月五日发表的“中美关系”的白皮书，虽然还没有窥见它的全貌，但仅仅从摘要文件中，我们很清楚地看到（一）美帝过去用尽种种方法援助支持反动的蒋介石政府，企图控制中国，奴役中国人民，作为反共、反民主的附庸，而口口声声却说：“支持中国的统一与领土完整”，满以为可以欺骗世人，掩饰自己的罪行；但结果他所支持的反动政府却如此“腐化无能”，“不中抬举”，到了头来，只得直白招了这篇“婉转哀怜”无可奈何的供状，把自己狰狞的面目原形毕现地暴露世界人士的面前。（二）尽管美帝援蒋已经到了今天无望的境地，但他破坏中国革命的伎俩还是不会终止的。艾奇逊不是在招认吗？“一切反对中国内部势力，在今日所已经达成的人民民主政治的发展，都将受到美国的鼓励”。这不是说即使蒋介石反动政府完全垮台了，他一定还要继续用种种方法“扶植”或“鼓励”其他恶势力来反对破坏人民政权吗？我们正告你——美帝国主义者，你这种打算必然还是失败的，中国人民力量强大到了今天，对付帝国主义者这些诡计阴谋，还会成问题吗？不过，我们还要提高警觉性，我们要用行动来答复帝国主义者的诡计和阴谋。（三）美帝忘记了自己的“尾巴”，却高嚷苏联是帝国主义，诋诬中国共产党是在“为外国帝国主义者利益而效力”，事实胜于雄辩，试问，苏联在中国三年来人民与反人民战争当中，有没有干涉过中国内政象你美帝那样的行为？有没有帮助过人民解放军金钱武器象你美帝那样帮助蒋介石的反动政府？中共“为外国帝国主义者利益而效力”的事实是那一件？能够举出来吗？这种种无耻无赖的谎言，简直不攻自破，正应了中国一句“作伪心劳日拙”的古话。尽管白皮书多到千余页，不过是“满纸荒唐言”罢了。
    马叙伦
    白皮书是多少年来美帝破坏中国的罪状
    美帝国主义国务卿艾奇逊发表了白皮书，虽然在表面上放弃了国民党反动集团，但在事实上美帝国主义又转向另一个方向想利用种种方法来破坏我们的人民革命阵线。据我看来，美帝的力量与我们中国人民的力量对比起来是很微弱的，它总归要失败；但我们不能不提高警惕，首先我们要团结一致，击溃其阴谋诡计，美帝还想利用中国自由主义分子来破坏我们，他们以为中国建设没有他们，就建设成功不了似的。假若我们团结起来，努力建设新中国，决不让美帝有点儿空隙来施其诡计。美帝的白皮书，正如新华社社论所言的是一篇“无可奈何的供状”，是多少年来美帝破坏中国使中国殖民地化的罪状，我们中国人民应当给它一种惩戒；同时它更使中国人民坚强的团结一致，给那些总以为美帝有什么好心的人一种强烈的教训。中国人民一定知道怎样对付美帝国主义的。
    揭穿美帝一切新阴谋
  　团结起来斗争到底
    彭泽民
    美帝最近发表“中美关系”的白皮书，充分暴露了它一贯侵略我国，干涉我国内政，扶助中国反动派屠杀中国人民的滔天罪恶。从赫尔利、马歇尔到魏德迈，都是美帝侵略大阴谋的实际执行人。从赫尔利起他们的以伪善的假面具掩护其对中国人民的进攻是一贯的，而且一次比一次来得凶残恶毒。此次“白皮书”的发表，正是美帝在中国大阴谋的全部失败的招供，好象贪婪的野兽受了迎头痛击之后的悲鸣一样。但是时至今日，这只野兽还是“未见黄河不死心”，还以其伪善者的脸孔，在“白皮书”中遮遮掩掩，掩护着进行最后一次的大阴谋，企图欺骗中国人民、美国人民以致全世界人民。所以，我们今天应该揭穿美帝的一切新阴谋，中国人民美国人民、以至全世界的爱好和平的人民，要提高警惕性，正视美帝危害世界和平的狂妄举动。团结起来“丢掉幻想，准备斗争”。毛主席指示我们应该“一面倒”，坚决站到以苏联为首的爱好和平、自由的民主阵营的一面，誓与仇视中国人民，侵略世界人民的美国帝国主义斗争到底。
    美帝妄图另找工具代替蒋匪
  　这一阴谋无疑定要失败
    许德珩
    在中国人民解放事业即将在全国范围获得胜利的今日，美国国务院发表了关于对华政策的白皮书。这不仅是为着对内推卸其外交政策犯了极大错误的责任，而实含有比从前更阴险的侵华阴谋。蒋介石军事买办法西斯官僚集团濒于全灭，已不足以作美国帝国主义者的主要工具，它妄想另外寻找工具，以代替蒋集团。这一企图，无疑地也是要失败的。美帝蒋匪在中国人民看来，是和日本帝国主义者及汪精卫没有区别的，甚至比它们更坏。美国反动政府倘仍寻找蒋介石一类的反动分子，来阻挠中国人民解放事业，必将激起中国人民以及世界各国爱好和平的人民更大的愤怒。蒋介石是中国最反动的军阀，他尚且失败了，其余更不必说。
    近数年来，蒋介石所以敢发动疯狂的内战，完全是由于美帝的支援和鼓励。美国白皮书已经明白承认了这一事实。现在蒋政权虽已完全溃败，而美帝国主义者仍然予以大量的军火飞机和金钱等的支援，滥炸各地城市，封锁沿海港口，同时又于幕后指示蒋介石季里诺李承晚等傀儡，进行其反共反苏的阴谋。这些事实，是中国人民无论如何也不会忘记的。我们一贯珍视中美人民间的传统友谊，坚决要求美国人民制止美国反动政府的这类暴行。
    胡愈之
    中国人民力量强大美帝如意算盘必败
    美国国务卿艾奇逊于发表白皮书后，向新闻记者发表声明，其中说：“美国的政策，不可放在幻想和如意算盘的基础之上。”一点没有错，美帝国主义对中国是有一套如意算盘的。那就是一边用美元、飞机、大炮供给中国的反动头子去屠杀中国人民，另一边收买一些软骨头的知识分子，即所谓自由主义分子或民主个人主义分子，去哄骗中国人民，这样就可以使中国人民服服贴贴地做美帝国主义的奴隶顺民，中国也就成为菲律宾第二了。谁知道这算盘没有打得准。美援军火大部分落入人民解放军之手，反动头子再也扶不起来。甚至美帝寄予无穷希望的自由主义分子，只除了胡适翁文灏等寥寥可数的一些渣滓外，也都背叛了美国主子，纷纷投效到人民这方面来了。美帝国主义的如意算盘完全打输了。为什么打输，是因为中国人民站了起来的缘故。帝国主义本来最会打算盘，但是它永远估计不到人民的力量，所以到最后总是失败的。虽然现在它明白过去打错了如意算盘，但以后它一定还要打另一套如意算盘。因为帝国主义除了会打算盘之外，是再不懂得什么的了。我们中国人民，特别是知识分子，要是想和帝国主义打算盘，是会打输了的。但人民要是拿出拳头来对付帝国主义的如意算盘，不但不会输，而且稳打赢。
    谭平山
    严肃民主革命阵营反对美帝破坏阴谋
    美帝政府违反中国人民的意志和中国民族的权益，帮助中国人民自己所痛恨的反动政府，屠杀中国人民，中国人民身受其苦，对于美帝凶暴的真相，和干涉中国内政的阴谋以及想奴役中国人民的企图，我中国人民早已深刻地认识了，而本月五日美帝国务院发表的所谓“中美关系”的白皮书，不过是美帝一种自己的供状罢了。但是在这一千零五十四页的白皮书以及美国国务卿艾奇逊的声明中，我们更知道美国的侵略政策，干涉中国内政的阴谋不会因为遭遇种种的失败而变更的。相反地，正因为美帝侵略政策的惨败，正因为他们感受着中国革命胜利的威胁，会更明目张胆地继续不断地干涉中国内政，破坏中国人民解放事业，我们中国人民是应该提高警惕的。我们从八月六日艾奇逊声明中所谓五项原则，其敌视中国人民的阴谋昭然若揭了。虽然如此，美帝的黔驴之技不过如是。今年元旦新华社的论文中已明白揭露其阴谋了，就是想在民主阵营中造成所谓“反对派”而已。我们的对策是，加强民主力量团结，严肃民主革命的阵营，巩固和扩大民主统一战线，尤其是要坚决地站在以苏联为首的反帝国主义的战线，与全世界民主和平力量携手共同奋斗。
    李德全
    粉碎美帝向中国人民进攻的毒辣企图
    中国革命的胜利是帝国主义集团尤其是美帝国主义在东方最大的溃败。艾奇逊的白皮书完全地暴露出来美帝国主义者如何通过蒋介石这个工具向中国人民进攻而失败了，但美帝还不甘心而仍以它狰狞的面目用一切的毒辣方法向中国人民进攻，美帝啊，你算了吧，快向中国人民低头吧！今天中国人民的力量怎会被你这自私自利的帝国主义者所能征服了的，解放了的中国人民在中国共产党领导下决不是反动的蒋政权时代的被迷蒙的人民了，中国人民已经认清只有坚持拥护人民民主专政的政策努力建设新民主主义的中国才是中国人民的幸福；只有站在以苏联为首的和平阵营方面才能使全世界的人民得到快乐。
    蔡廷锴
    全国人民必能团结一起彻底粉碎美帝阴谋
    自美国的白皮书发表以后，凡是我国的民主党派，人民团体，工农大众，莫不敌忾同仇，更深一层的认识美帝国主义的狰狞面目，只有使正在前线奋勇杀敌的人民解放军，更加热烈的奋勇向前，打到海南岛去，打到台湾去，把美帝的走狗，残余的蒋介石匪军，彻底肃清！
    美帝国主义明知国民党反动派，是一个最无能的，最腐朽的，得不到中国人民支持的最反动的集团，然而它却偏要帮助这个集团与中国人民为敌，目的就是为了要把中国成为一季里诺、李承晚式的傀儡政府，以便奴役中国人民，使中国成为一个十足的美帝国主义的殖民地！
    在不可挽救的，正在灭亡中的国民党反动统治，美帝还想利用什么“民主个人主义者”来组织反共派别，企图推翻中国人民民主政权，那真是梦想！须知今天中国人民已经觉悟起来了，尤其在中国共产党毛主席英明的领导下，全中国人民必能团结在一块把美帝的阴谋彻底粉碎！
    陈其尤
    中国人民有把握击退美帝的侵略
    美国的白皮书发表以后，我有四点意见：第一，我觉得美帝国主义要掩护对中国的侵略，但完全十足的暴露了它的面孔。第二，美帝国主义对蒋匪帮残杀人民发动内战的罪恶，光推在蒋介石身上，事实上是由他一贯的在后面指使的。第三，白皮书所讲的人民政权背后有一帝国主义在支配，实际上，帝国主义就是美国，它支持着国民党反动派政权。但中国人民是反帝国主义的，与国际和平阵线是站在一起为反帝而奋斗。第四，美帝国主义支持蒋介石失败了，它想继续欺骗中国人民，改头换面，利用所谓“民主个人自由主义者”进行支持反人民政府，但我们人民是有把握去消灭一切反动派，并击退美帝国主义对我们这种侵略行动的。
