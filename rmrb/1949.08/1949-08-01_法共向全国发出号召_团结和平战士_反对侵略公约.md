Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 31st: TASS, Paris -- The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a communiqué after a meeting held on July 28th, stating: The North Atlantic Treaty was approved by a majority in the National Assembly – from the leaders of the Socialist Party to the Gaullists (members of the French People's Rally) – with the exception of the Communist Party members, members of the Progressive Republican Alliance, and some members who refused to vote to approve the treaty. The Political Bureau pointed out the class nature of the National Assembly's majority vote, stating that the various representatives of the majority openly admitted that the North Atlantic Treaty is directed against socialist countries, against people's democracies, against the labor and progressive movements in their own countries, and against the liberation movements of colonial peoples. The communiqué pointed out: The implementation of the North Atlantic Treaty clauses will have serious consequences. It will further strengthen and bring closer the danger of a new destructive war. It will destroy the remnants of national independence, benefiting American imperialism. It will greatly increase military spending, thereby further reducing the living standards of the working masses and ordinary civilians, and increasing the taxes of all taxpayers. The Political Bureau urged French men and women to launch the necessary struggle against the North Atlantic Treaty as much as possible. The Political Bureau is convinced that this struggle will unite all peace fighters. The Political Bureau also heard a report on the working people's demands for holiday allowances. The Political Bureau expressed satisfaction that this movement has a broad scope and has been victorious in many places. The Political Bureau decided to support this movement in every way.

    【新华社北平三十一日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党政治局在七月二十八日举行会议之后发表公报称：北大西洋公约在国民议会中以多数——从社会党领袖到戴高乐派（法国人民联盟人员）——批准了，只有共产党议员、进步共和联盟的党员和一些拒绝投票批准该公约的议员除外。政治局指出国民议会多数派之投票的阶级性称，多数派各种不同的代表公开承认，北大西洋公约是针对社会主义国家、针对人民民主国家、针对本国的劳工和进步运动、针对殖民地人民的解放运动的。公报指出：北大西洋公约条款的实施，将造成严重的后果。它将使新的毁灭性战争的危险更为加强和迫近。它将毁灭国家独立的残余，而利于美国帝国主义。它将使军事开支大大增加，因而使劳苦群众和普通平民的生活标准更为降低，使一切纳税者的税额更为增高。政治局力促法国男女尽量展开反对北大西洋公约的必要斗争。政治局深信，这一斗争将团结一切和平的战士。政治局也听取了关于劳动人民要求假期津贴的报告。政治局对于这一运动已具有广泛的规模并在许多地方得到胜利一节表示满意。政治局决定用一切方法支持这一运动。
