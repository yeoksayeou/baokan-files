[This City News] The Municipal People's Government recently received twenty-one letters from the Third Brigade of the First Detachment of the Southward Work Group, "Farewell to the Fathers, Elders, Brothers, and Sisters of Beiping." These letters were written in the name of squads or individuals. The letters unanimously expressed gratitude to the people of Beiping from all walks of life for the various assistance they had provided over the past four months, as well as the warm send-offs and慰问 (comforts and greetings) they received before their departure. In various different phrases, they told the people of Beiping that these assistance and encouragement enabled them to complete the learning tasks assigned by their superiors in the past four months; and filled them with the determination and belief that they would live up to the cultivation and expectations of the people of Beiping during their southward journey. They promised that after going south, they would continue to learn in their work, thoroughly transform themselves under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, maintain and carry forward the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army, and closely integrate with the people of Jiangnan to fight for the liberation of all of China. Comrade Wei Zhen of the Tenth Squad of the Tenth Company wrote: "We are willing to make the following guarantees to you: First, we guarantee to carry the revolution through to the end and successfully complete the southward mission; second, we guarantee to be servants of the people and serve the people wholeheartedly; third, we guarantee to always be good students of Mao Zedong." They all sincerely hope that the people of Beiping will respond to all the calls of the Communist Party and the People's Government and build a new Beiping.
