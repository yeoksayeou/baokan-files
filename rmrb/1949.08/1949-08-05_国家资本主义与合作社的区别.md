    The Difference Between State Capitalism and Cooperatives

    Question: "What is state capitalism? What is the difference between it and cooperatives?"

    Answer: State capitalism is a form of economic organization that arises through cooperation between the state and private capitalism—that is, through contracts for a certain period of time made according to the needs of the state—with the aim of mobilizing and organizing private capital to develop the national economy of the new China. All activities of this state capitalism are placed under the strict supervision of the state to fulfill the established contract contents.

    The form of cooperation is, firstly, to cooperate with existing private capitalist enterprises of considerable scale or significance, adopting processing systems, such as the state supplying them with raw materials that are not easily obtained from the market and processing them on behalf of the state, or adopting ordering systems, such as the state ordering all or part (as stipulated in the contract) of the products of a certain enterprise. In this way, on the one hand, the difficulties of private capitalism in purchasing raw materials and selling finished products are solved, enabling it to carry out and expand production; on the other hand, its anarchy is reduced or even eliminated, and the planned nature of the national economy is realized. Another form is to adopt joint ventures or concessions for enterprises that need to be developed but have not yet been established (because the state does not yet have the full strength to build them). In this way, private capital is absorbed and organized to invest in economic undertakings that are beneficial to the people's livelihood, and the state's strict supervision of the established contracts also guarantees its planned nature in the national economy and prevents it from running rampant freely.

    It should be noted here that occasionally processing or ordering goods from a certain private capital enterprise once or twice, or processing or ordering in small quantities, should not be regarded as state capitalism. The so-called state capitalism, which is the cooperation between the state and private capitalism, is based on a long-term and substantial strict contract.

    So, what is the difference between state capitalism and the state-owned economy? The difference lies in the fact that the former contains all or part of private capital. Therefore, this allows private capital to obtain a certain surplus value that it should obtain. That is to say, in state capitalist enterprises, the surplus labor of workers does not all become the common property of the people, but a part of it is exploited by private capital and becomes the profit of private capitalists. In state-owned enterprises, because it is the property of the whole people, its surplus value entirely becomes the wealth of the people and the capital for the people's reproduction, instead of all or part of it being privately obtained, and there is no exploitation.

    It differs from private capitalism in that the profits of state capitalist enterprises are not entirely obtained by private capital, but the state (that is, the people) obtains a part. At the same time, the fulfillment of established contracts makes it easier for state capitalism to be under the constraints of the state's economic plan, making it more planned than private capitalism. Of course, private capital, under the leadership of the people's democratic national economy, must also be brought into the track of the overall national economic development, but there is still some blindness.

    What is the difference between it and cooperatives? The first difference is that cooperatives are established on the basis of a majority of privately owned individual economies, and they gradually transition from individual economies to collective economies, while state capitalism is not. The second difference is that cooperatives are equal mutual assistance among laborers, or a union to reduce or even eliminate intermediate exploitation. Therefore, there is a friendly relationship of cooperation, mutual assistance, and common development among the members, while in state capitalist enterprises, capitalists still hire laborers, and capitalist exploitation still exists.

    国家资本主义与合作社的区别
    问：“什么是国家资本主义？它与合作社有何区别？”
    答：国家资本主义是通过国家和私人资本主义的合作——这就是根据国家需要而订立的一定时期的契约——而产生的一种经济形态，目的是为了动员和组织私人资本来发展新中国的国民经济。这种国家资本主义的全部活动都是放在国家的严格监督之下，来履行既定的契约内容。
    合作的形式，一种是与现有相当规模，或有相当意义的私人资本主义企业合作，而采取加工制，如由国家供给它从市场上不容易得到的原料，而代国家加工，或采定货制，如由国家订购某企业的全部或一部（按契约规定）出品，这样就一方面解决了私人资本主义在收买原料和推销成品的困难，而使它能进行并扩大生产，另方面也就减少甚至消灭它的无政府状态，而实现了国家经济的计划性。另种形式是需要发展而未建立（因国家还没有全部力量建设）的企业，则采取合资制，或租让制，这样便吸收并组织了私人资本投向有利于国民生计的经济事业，而国家对既订契约的严格监督，也保证了它在国家经济中的计划性，而不使自由泛滥。
    这里要注意，不要把对某私人资本企业，偶而一两次的加工或定货、或数量微小的加工或定货就把它看成是国家资本主义，所谓由国家与私人资本主义合作的国家资本主义，是建立在较长时期的，并有相当内容的严密的契约之上的。
    那么，国家资本主义与国营经济有什么不同呢？其区别就在于前者存在着全部或一部私人资本，因之，这却使私人资本也获得一定的、所应获得的剩余价值，就是说在国家资本主义企业中，工人的剩余劳动不是全部的成为人民的共有财产，而为私人资本所剥削其一部分去，成为私人资本家的利润了。在国营企业中，则因它是全民财产、它的剩余价值是全部的成为人民的财富、成为人民的再生产的资金，而不是全部或一部为私人所得，而不存在剥削。
    它和私人资本主义的不同，就在于国家资本主义企业的利润不是全部的为私人资本所得，而由国家（也就是人民）获有一部分，同时既订契约的履行，也就便于使国家资本主义，处在国家经济计划的约束之下，较之私人资本主义更能实现计划性些。当然私人资本在人民民主的国家经济领导下，也要导入整个国民经济发展的轨道，但多少还存在有盲目性。
    它和合作社有什么不同呢？它的区别第一，就是合作社是在多数的私有的个体经济的基础上建立起来的，是由个体经济逐渐的过渡到集体经济，而国家资本主义则不是。第二个区别就是合作社是劳动者等价互助，或是为减轻甚至消灭中间剥削的联合，因此，社员之间是合作互助共同发展的友谊关系，而在国家资本主义的企业中还是资本家雇佣劳动者，还存在着资本主义剥削。
