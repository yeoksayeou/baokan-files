　　Animal Epidemic Occurs in Hot Springs, City Government Sends Team for Injections and Treatment
    [This newspaper reported] Recently, an infectious "equine jaundice" disease broke out among livestock in the Hot Springs area of the Sixteenth District in the Western Suburbs. More than 20 mules, horses, and donkeys have died, causing great panic among the masses, who were unable to treat the disease. After learning of this situation, the Municipal Government immediately dispatched a veterinary prevention and treatment team to the area to treat the livestock and administer preventive injections. Comrades from the prevention and treatment team also personally brought medicine to nearby villages for injections and treatment, and explained preventive measures for the disease to the masses. Thanks to the active work of the comrades on the prevention and treatment team, more than 320 livestock were injected and seven sick animals were cured within two days.
