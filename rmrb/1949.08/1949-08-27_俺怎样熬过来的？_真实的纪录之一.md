　　How Did I Survive?
    – A True Record (One)
    Yan Chen
    Speaking of me, from the very start, I suffered grievances. After entering this family, I never enjoyed a single day of happiness.

    I was originally from the common folk. How could I have looked for a husband (sought a husband’s family) so far away and ended up here? Wasn't it because of the bad years, when we couldn't make a living at home, that I was sold?

    His father's family was poor and couldn't find a wife in their own village. A Muslim from the city, during a visit, was asked by his grandmother to find one for him. This city dweller had a plan in mind. She found my mother and used sweet words to say:

    "In these times, relying on elm leaves and hemp seeds might get you through seven or eight days, but any longer and it will drag you down. You are so capable, but you’re foolish about this. Hiding a fourteen or fifteen-year-old daughter at home will only have her starve to death with you! Let me take her to Beiyan, find her a good match, guaranteed a grand house and courtyard, with food and clothing. Over there, the land is all irrigated, one mu yields as much as five or six mu here. Isn't that much better than staying at home?"

    She said it this way and that. My mother thought she had no other choice and said, "Take her if you want, but if you can't find a match, the money for her meals on the road will be your loss. If you can find a match, the money they give over there can be deducted from that." So, I left home, left my mother, and followed the city dweller.

    She'd lose money on meals? Could she possibly fail to find a match? She had already arranged it with his grandmother. His family wasn't a landlord, of course, there was no grand house and courtyard, the land was irrigated, but rented from others. Life was hard, just like at my house, suffering exploitation, but at least they hadn't encountered bad harvests. His grandmother couldn't afford the money. Begging and pleading, she scraped together seventy yuan, but only thirty yuan remained when it reached my mother's hands. The matchmaker earned forty. Her words were sweet as honey, but her heart was blacker than coal!

    At fourteen or fifteen, I didn't understand anything! I had to serve the grandfather and grandmother. My child also had a grandfather and grandmother, two layers of elders above me. Adding to that, his father had four brothers. Such a large family, I had to do all the work, it was truly overwhelming.

    Every day, I did household chores and field work. At night, while others slept soundly, I had to take a large pile of "gujie" (cotton rolls) to the dugout cellar to spin. The dugout was warmer than the house, but my hands and feet still froze numb, it was no pleasure. Only after spinning this pile of "gujie" could I go back to sleep.

    The family was poor. His father took on odd jobs outside, but it wasn't enough. And me? After autumn, I gleaned after the harvest. After the wheat harvest, I gleaned wheat. In the spring, I gathered elm seeds, and in the autumn, I gathered cotton, radishes, and firewood. I spent the whole year gathering these scraps, but still couldn't eat pancake every day.

    Father said, "Such a large family, with only three or four mu of 'gagu' land, we can't survive. We should separate, and everyone should find their own food and drink."

    Where to find food and drink? Some took on odd jobs, some carried a peanut basket, some put on their "two and a half" (referring to a style of shoe) and went far away, never to be heard from again.

    At the time of the family division, I had three children. Counting his father and me, there were five of us, living in a small room. This small room, as you can see, was only a zhang square (approximately 10 feet square), with low earthen walls, covered with some grass and plastered with mud. It was considered a home, but it never had a proper door, nor even a window. Two sticks laid across made a window of sorts. As for the door? It never saw a piece of wood. In winter, we hung a grass mat to block the wind, and in summer, it was just an open gap. Inside the room, the kang (heated brick bed) took up most of the space. A pot was set into the edge of the kang, next to a large earthenware jar for water. That was about it. Anything more wouldn't fit in the house.

    This room was originally built the year I was married, said to be a new house, but it was worse than the rich man's animal shed! Back then, we勉强(miǎnqiáng - barely) kept a donkey. Once, the donkey shed collapsed, and the donkey was kept in our room, making it even more crowded. I had to feed the children and feed the donkey. The children cried, the donkey brayed, and I couldn't sleep peacefully at night.

    Later, the donkey was sold, and we had more children. A family of eight, all squeezed inside. There were only two torn blankets on the kang, one blanket covering four people. This one pulled, that one tugged, not even covering the belly. While the children were sound asleep, I had to spin thread, sell it at the market to buy oil and salt. Where was the spinning wheel placed? In the corner of the kang, of course, where else could it be put!

    I've occupied this little room from the very start, and I've been living in it for twenty-eight years now.

    His father was willing to suffer, but he had no sense of business. Taking on odd jobs couldn't support the family. Doing a small business? He couldn't keep track of the accounts, he didn't even know how to read a scale. What could I do? I, a woman, had to take on the responsibilities of a man and run around to make a living.

    I went to Shimen to dig coal and sold it in Gangtou. After selling it at noon, I would hurry back to Shimen. Each time, I carried a hundred or so jin (about 100-110 pounds), walking dozens of li (miles). I often didn't get home until I was groping around in the dark for twenty or thirty li. The next day, before dawn, I had to hurry back to Gangtou.

    When the Japanese devils occupied Shimen, carrying coal became even more difficult. The devils on guard didn't understand our language. They only let people pass the guard post at a set time. If you told them that you had children at home waiting for milk, the devils would say, "Let him tear him tear (dead dead) of!" When you finally got through the checkpoint, you weren't allowed to take large pieces of coal. You had to break it up first and put it in a burlap sack, claiming it was for home use, before they would let you carry it away.

    At that time, the Japanese talked about rationing. The countryside lacked everything. I also carried dyes, carried matches... To carry dyes, you had to throw away the tin can, otherwise the sound would easily give you away. You packed the dye in bundles in your pants leg. You threw away the matchbox, broke up the matches and carried them. If you were caught, be careful with your life! Back then, the Japanese devils, did they treat the common people as human beings?

    I also went to Zhengding to push salt. Early in the morning, I pushed a small cart, squeaking and creaking. Crossing the Hutuo River required wading through water, more than half a li wide, no walk in the park. I rolled up my trousers high, but the water still splashed my pants. Walking in the water, I swayed and couldn't control myself. I didn't know which part of the riverbed was high, which was low. One misstep, and I'd break out in a cold sweat.

    After wading through the water, I had to walk through three li of sandy beach. The sand was loose. With each step, I sank to my knees. It took so much effort to take even half a step. My heart was anxious, my head was covered in sweat. I also had to watch the cart, to keep it from tipping over, otherwise the salt would spill, and I'd lose everything.

    Running around blindly like this, I could earn a dou (about 10 liters) if I could, five sheng (half a dou) if I could, enough to keep our mouths shut, and that was all. If it rained, and I couldn't run around, we would go hungry for two days!

    That year, the mother’s family was flooded. My mother and her eldest and second elder brother escaped to here. After staying for two days, I couldn't barely afford to feed them. The eldest elder brother went to Shimen to pull rickshaws, and later took the second elder brother and mother there. Only my father was left at home, blind, with no one to take care of him. He starved to death at home. When the water receded, my mother and them returned home. Maggots were already growing on my father’s body.

    Only three years later, the mother’s family was hit by a locust plague. What to do? The eldest elder brother gritted his teeth and joined the army. Mother came to my place for twenty days. Seeing that I also had nothing to eat, and wanting to leave, her eyes were swollen to the point that she couldn't walk. That was the fake fire from starvation. His father said, "If you stay another three days, everyone will have nothing to eat. Won't you still have to leave?"

    The mother begged for a while of rice in the east, and came again in October. She said, "Girl! I’ll come see you again, I'm going home, I don't know if I'll ever see you again." I gave her a dou of chaff, three sheng of rice, two bowls of salt, and took off my lined jacket and gave it to her. She was exposed to wind and rain outside, having a meal one day and not the next, old, and went home and died seventeen days after going home, so it was really never seen again. The second elder brother could not afford a coffin, so he put mother in a cabinet and buried her.

    The second elder brother took over the legacy of the mother and also came to Beiyan to beg for food, and was caught by the Japanese devils to dig a trench and was beaten to death there.

    Mother’s family, some were starved to death, some died of disease, some were beaten to death, and all died. Alas! There is no way out for the poor in the old world.

    And this family? Also scratching and living hard. Not to mention other things, food is the most important. Seeing those landlords and rich people fold their hands and do nothing, but digging up flour and digging up rice, it's really hateful! I rented a little land from the landlord, worked hard all year, and it all ended up in someone else's granary. To get seeds for the following year, I had to pay the grain first (the rent) with one hand, and then get the contract with the other. Thinking about how the landlords and rich people can calculate and how cruel they are, how can they not get richer and richer, and the tight ones get tighter and tighter!

    In previous years, after autumn, I had to plan all day long, say, how many pancakes would we eat in a month, how many in a day, how many for each person. – Don't say there’s too much, there is no need to eat it. – After being so careful, by the second month of spring, there was nothing left.

    One year, I ran around more enthusiastically, and the harvest was also good. I spent two thousand yuan at the market to buy a piglet, raised it and slaughtered it for the New Year. I told his father, we haven't tasted meat for so many years, let the children eat half a piece of meat this year for the New Year. Half of it was sold, the remaining half was cooked, and before the New Year, the debt to the landlord could not be paid, so the cooked meat was sold again.

    If we couldn't take care of food, how could we take care of clothing? Picking up scraps of cloth to make clothes, picking up bits of cotton to make shoes. That year, the winter was so cold that my youngest child couldn't bear it, and shuddered constantly, hugging his shoulders. The eldest son who lived in the west, the house was full, who was his godson (adopted)? He went to join the army, and gave a torn lined cotton-padded trousers to the youngest son. He didn't have a coat, and the family's general manager mixed and gave the youngest son saying: “youngest small youngest, you kowtow to the old uncle, you want to find a way to get something to wear!” He led the youngest child to the home of Baba Egg, and said to Baba Egg: “You put on a new coat, how comfortable! Look at youngest small, freezing and can't survive the New Year, think is pity, and give him the old one!” The youngest child had not frozen to death.

    …Day after day, year after year, I still think about how those days were survived!

    This place was liberated last year in February.

    The People's Liberation Army and the diehard army happened to be back-to-back. When the stubborn army was around, I sold watermelons in the summer, and they came to eat watermelons all day long, just like I stole them. Not to mention not paying money, but if they did not eat the sweet still had to be angry, these diehard eggs did not have eyes to call the sky.

    When the People's Liberation Army came, but they were very kind, and did not call the old mother without speaking. An old comrade of the working class, Comrade Ma, often came to my house to sit, and seeing that I was not doing well, he insisted on finding a cloth bag to get two dou of grain. — Then there was rent reduction and interest reduction — I still had a change of thought, afraid that eating it would offend people. He said: "What are you afraid of? Committing this crime, committing that crime, and also committing the crime of starving to death! All the rules are set by the landlords and rich people, we want to turn it over from beginning to end!"

    This year, with the land reform, my mind opened up. I participated in the peasant association, overthrew the landlord, and also became a member of the peasant association. If I hadn’t been active, how could people have elected me?

    At this time, I was allocated two rooms, and I bought some furniture. I had vases to carry and tables and chairs to lift. I was wide and comfortable, like a person. The children also received some clothes, and I no longer worried about shivering in the winter. The youngest son wanted a "turnover coat" and wore it all day long, reluctant to take it off.

    The land was divided, and the father and children were happy to be in the ground all day long, and they were more energetic in their work. During the wheat harvest, other people ate sesame oil and white noodles, and we still ate more than 300 pounds of yam flour residue; when eating sorghum pancakes, we also mixed chaff and yam leaves. At noon, I made some thin and thick noodles for the children. Compared to before, it was not bad.

    People say: "You have turned over, why are you still eating chaff and vegetables?"

    His father said: The wheat that was hit, turned over and over or those two piles of bumps, we must first save it for the New Year; besides, when it is time for the animals to work, let the animals eat some red sorghum, they will have strength to work, and we will be careful to save some, exchange it for chaff, and it is not tight to be hard.

    I said: I am used to suffering every year, and I am reluctant to eat even when I have food. It is also happy to put things aside and not eat them, and then I do not need to borrow from the landlord. Besides, even if there is some, it is not good to be more comfortable? Save money, get a job, and marry a daughter-in-law.

    Speaking of marrying a daughter-in-law? I'm not worried at this time, the child is not very big. Development and production are important. I want to accumulate some money and buy a waterwheel to tidy up the land well, produce more grain, and have a good life. It is not difficult to get a daughter-in-law:

    The land was only divided this year, and I have not been able to catch my breath. After that, I will be able to sink to the bottom. If I don't catch up with other people in three years, I will not be able to do it.

　　俺怎样熬过来的？
    ——真实的纪录之一
    严辰
    提起俺呀，扎根就受屈，进了这门，没享过一天福。
    俺原是民晋的，怎么能老远觅主（寻婆家）觅到这里？还不是年头赖，家里活不了，被人卖来的！
    他爹家里穷，在本乡本土说不上媳妇。这里住房的回民晋，他奶奶托她顺便给说上一个。住房的存了心，找到俺娘，花言巧语的说：
    “这样的年头，靠点榆叶、麻仁，将就七天八天还成，要长了不把人拖垮？你那样利落，偏偏这上头傻，把十四五岁的大闺女藏在家里，要她陪你一起饿死哟！俺给带到北沿，好好觅一个主，保管高宅大院，有吃有穿，那边尽是水浇地，一亩顶这里五六亩收成，那不胜比在家里强得多？”
    横说竖说，娘想想没法，就说：“你带去就带去吧，觅不到主，在路上管饭的钱算你赔，能寻上主唠，那边给多少钱从里边扣除。”这么的，俺就离开了家，离开了娘，跟着住房的走了。
    她赔饭钱？她还能觅不上主？她早给他奶奶说好啦。他家不是地主，当然没有高宅大院，地倒是水浇地，可是租着人家的，光景不好过，和俺家一样受剥削，就强个没遭上坏年成。他奶奶拿不出钱，东求西恳的，揭了七十块钱，到俺娘手里，才剩了三十块，媒人却挣了四十。看她嘴说得蜜甜，心可是比乌煤还黑咧！
    十四五岁的人，不懂个百么！要侍候爷爷、奶奶，俺孩子还有爷爷、奶奶，头上两层大人；加上他爹兄弟四个，这么一大家子人，什么活都要俺做，真是忙不过来。
    每日白天做家里活、地里活，黑夜别人睡得“轩呼打呼”的，俺还要抱一大堆“股节”（棉卷）到地窨子里去纺。地窨子比家里暖些，可也冻得手僵脚麻，不是个滋味。这堆“股节”纺完了，才能回去睡。
    家里穷，他爹在外揽活，也不济事；俺呢？过秋拾秋，过麦拾麦，春天拾榆钱，秋天拾棉花，拾萝卜、拾柴火。成年拾搭那些，还成年吃不上饼子。
    爹爹说：“这么一大家子，才三四亩‘嘎咕’地，再过不下了。还是分分嘴吧，各人找各人的吃喝。”
    到哪儿找吃喝？还不是有的揽活，有的挎了个花生篮子，有的穿起二尺半，走远了再没个音讯。
    分家那会儿，俺有了三个孩子，连他爹，俺，五口子，住一间小房。这小房你也看到了，才一丈见方，矮矮的土墙，盖上些草，抹上些泥，算是个家，也没按过门，也没有个窗户。——用两根棒棒一横，算是个窗户，门呢？从来不见一片木片，冬天挂个草扇挡挡风，夏天就豁拉着个口。房里除了一个炕占去多半，炕边埋一个锅，旁边放个盛水的瓮，再就什么也没啦。要有，房子里也装不下。
    这房原是娶俺那年盖的，说是新房，比起财主家的牲口屋还差多呢！那会还勉勉强强喂着个毛驴，有一回毛驴棚坍了，毛驴也喂到俺屋里，更转不开身了。我又要喂孩子，又要喂毛驴，孩子哭，毛驴叫，晚上也不得放心睡觉。
    以后毛驴卖了，孩子又多起来了，一家八口子，全挤在里面，炕上只两条破被，一条被盖四个人，这个一牵，那个一扯，连肚也盖不住。趁孩子们睡定，俺还得纺线，赶集上卖了能换个油盐。纺车放哪里？也就是放在炕角呗，还有什么地方好放的！
    俺扎根占的这小房，到如今直占了二十八年。
    他爹会死受，可没个心眼，揽活养不活一家子，要做个小买卖吧，他帐数又不清，连个秤也认不得。有什么法，俺个娘们就顶汉子跑搭开了。
    俺上石门挖煤，到岗头去卖。晌午卖掉，再赶石门，每回背百十来斤，走几十里地，常常得恋（摸）二三十里的黑才到家，第二天天不明，又得赶岗头。
    日本鬼子占了石门，背煤也困难了。鬼子站岗又不懂话，到点数（时间）才让出岗，你告诉他家里有孩子等着要吃奶，鬼子却说：让他撕拉撕拉（死了死了）的！等得出岗了，大块的煤又不让拿，你得先打碎了装在麻袋里，说是家里烧的才让背走。
    那会鬼子讲配给，乡下什么也缺，俺也带过颜料，带过洋火……。带颜料得把洋铁筒扔了，要不有声音容易查出，把颜料散包扎在裤筒里。洋火把盒子扔开，也打散了带。要查出来，小心你的性命！鬼子那会，把老百姓那里当人看待哟？
    俺还到正定去推过盐，一早起推了个小车，吱吱扭扭的。过滹沱河要趟水，半里多宽的河面，可不是玩儿的。高高地卷起了裤脚，水还是把裤溅湿了。人走在水里，摇摇幌幌地作不了主，不知河底哪一处高，哪一处低，一个失脚，吓出一身冷汗。
    趟完水，又得走三里宽的一片沙滩，沙松松的，一脚踩下去埋到膝盖，这条腿拔起，那条腿又陷进去，费上多大的劲，才迈开半步路。心里尽着急，头上直冒汗。还得顾着车，别让它侧过一边，要不盐撒了就本也赔啦。
    这么瞎跑搭，能弄一斗是一斗，能弄五升是五升，糊住嘴算不错。遇上阴天下雨，跑搭不了，还不要饿两天！
    那年大水，娘家淹了，老娘和他大舅二舅逃到这里，住了两天，我紧巴巴的养活不起，大舅去石门拉洋车，以后把二舅、老娘也领去。娘家就剩俺爹一个人，眼瞎了，没人管他，活活地饿死在家里。等水平了，老娘他们回去，爹身上都长蛆啦。
    才过三年，娘家又遭蝗灾。怎么办呢？大舅狠狠心当兵走了。老娘来俺这里住了二十多天，看看俺也没吃的，想走，眼肿得不能走，那是饿得虚火啦。他爹说：“再住三天大家没得吃的，不是还得走？”
    老娘到东边要了一阵饭，十月天又来，她说：“妮！再来看看你，俺要回家了，往后不知还能不能看到你哩。”俺给了她一斗糠，三升米，两碗盐，把身上的夹袄也脱给了她。她在外面风吹雨打，有一顿没一顿的，年纪又大，回家十七天就死去，真是再不能看到了。二舅买不起棺材，把娘装到躺柜里埋了。
    二舅接了老娘的衣钵，也来北沿要饭，碰上鬼子赶他去挖沟，被打死在那里。
    老娘家一家子饿的饿死，病的病死，打的打死，算绝了。唉！旧世道走到那都没有穷人的活路。
    这个家呢？也是穷跑搭苦撑。别的不说，吃是头一款。看着人家地主老财袖拢个手，啥都不干，却挖面有面，挖米有米，真叫人可恨！俺租了地主一点地，忙碌一年，全都落到别人的囤里，要接种下年，还得一手先缴粮（上打租），一手才能接文书。想想地主老财多会盘算，多心狠，怎么能不宽的越弄越旺，紧的越弄越转不开呢！
    往年过了秋，就成天要打算，说饼子吧，一月吃几个，一天吃几个，一人吃几个。——有咧不嫌，没唠就数着个哩！——这么穷算精算，算到开春二月，也就什么也没了。
    有一年跑搭得欢些，年成也不赖，在集上化二千元买了个小猪，喂了喂过年杀了。俺说他爹，多少年没尝过腥味，今年过年也让孩子吃半块肉。那半个卖了，留下半个煮了煮，临过年还不了地主的债，又把熟肉卖了。
    吃的顾不上，还能顾穿的？拣点布片就是个衣，拾点棉花才是双鞋。那年冬天冷得俺黑小受不了，抱着个肩尽哆嗦。西头满囤的小子认了（过寄）俺哩，他去当兵，把破夹裤给了黑小。他没个袄，当家子混章给黑小说：“黑小黑小，你给大伯叩过头，给你想法弄件穿的去！”他领了黑小到巴巴蛋家，对巴巴蛋说：“你穿上了新袄，可舒坦呀！你看人家黑小冷得过不了年，只当可怜，把旧的给了他吧！”黑小这算没有冻死。
    ……一天一天，一年一年，还会想起来，那日子不知是怎么挨过来的！
    去年二月解放的这儿。
    解放军和顽固军正好是个背对背。顽固军在时，夏天俺卖西瓜，他们就成天来吃西瓜，就象俺是偷来的。不给钱别说了，吃得不甜还要发脾气，这些顽固蛋不败叫天没有眼睛。
    解放军来了，可和和气气的，不叫大娘不说话。有个做工作的老马同志，也常来俺家坐，看俺不好过，一定要找一个布袋，去给弄二斗粮食。——那会闹减租减息了——俺还有变天思想，怕吃了得罪人家。他说：“你怕啥？犯这个罪，犯那个罪，还犯饿死的罪呀！什么规矩全是地主老财定下的，咱们要把它翻个得底过！”
    今年土地改革，俺脑筋打开了，参加了农会，斗倒了地主，还当了农会委员。不积极，人家能选上俺哪？
    这会分到了两间房，置了点家什，瓮挑桌椅抬的，宽宽畅畅，象了个人家，孩子也分了点穿的，再不发愁冬天冻得打哆嗦了。黑小要了件“翻身袄”，成天披着不舍得脱。
    分了点地，乐得他爹和孩子成天长在地里，干活也有了劲。过麦熟那会，人家香油白面吃上了，俺们还吃了三百多斤山药粉渣；吃高粱饼子，也掺着糠和山药叶。晌午给孩子们稀不稀稠不稠的做点面糊，比起早先，就算不赖。
    人家说：“翻了身，你还吃糠咽菜的干吗？”
    他爹说：打的麦子，翻过来掉过去还是那两圪垛，先得省着过年过节吃；再说，正要牲口干活的时候，让牲口吃点红高粱，干起来有劲，俺们细点省点，换上点糠，人苦点不吃紧。
    俺说：俺每年受苦受惯了，有了吃的也舍不得。物件搁着不吃，心里也欢喜，往后不要向地主借贷了。再说，就算有，宽绰点不好呀？省下钱，置得事件，娶得媳妇。
    说是娶得媳妇吗？这会不着急，孩子还不算大。发家生产要紧，俺想积点钱，买个水车，把地打整的好好的，多打粮食，日子宽绰了，要媳妇不费难：
    今年才分地，还缓不上气来，往后就能沉住底了。看过了三年俺这日子要不赶过人家，算俺没能耐。
