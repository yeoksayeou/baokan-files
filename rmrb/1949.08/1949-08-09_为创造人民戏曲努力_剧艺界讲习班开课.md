    In an effort to fulfill the eager desire for learning expressed by many members of the Peking Opera Guild, Quyi Guild, and Ping Opera Guild of Beiping, the North China Cultural Affairs Commission's Old Drama Department and the Municipal Cultural Affairs Commission's Old Drama Section are jointly holding a training class. After more than a month of preparation, the opening ceremony was held yesterday (the 8th) at 10:00 AM. At the meeting, Liu Naichong of the North China Cultural Affairs Commission's Old Drama Department reported on the preparations. Wang Songsheng, Secretary-General of the Municipal Cultural Affairs Commission, spoke, expressing his hope that after studying, everyone would remove the feudalistic and superstitious content from the old operas and create dramas that are in line with New Democracy, in line with Chinese national forms, and are scientific and popular. He said that to truly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, it is necessary to understand their feelings and stand on the position of the proletariat, so that the plays created will be new dramas that meet the needs of the people. Ma Yanxiang, Director of the Old Drama Department of the North China Cultural Affairs Commission, explained that old operas in the past basically served the ruling class, and he hoped that everyone would transform their thinking through this study, create people's drama, and better serve the people.
    According to reports, more than 450 people from the three guilds, including the Peking Opera Guild, have signed up for this training class. The study period will run from August 8th to the end of September. Classes will be held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM at the Democratic Theater. The content of the study will focus on establishing a new outlook on life; in terms of professional skills, the direction and methods of reforming old operas will be studied. The learning method will emphasize both listening to reports and group research. The training class will be directly led by the Old Drama Section of the Municipal Cultural Affairs Commission.
