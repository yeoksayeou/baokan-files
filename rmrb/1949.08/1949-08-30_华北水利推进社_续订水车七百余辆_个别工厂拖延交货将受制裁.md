　　North China Water Conservancy Promotion Society
  　Continues to Order Over Seven Hundred Waterwheels
    Individual Factories Delay Delivery and Will Be Sanctioned
    [This City News] Over twenty private iron factories in this city are thriving due to their production being oriented towards the countryside. However, some factory owners have attempted to deceive and will be sanctioned. The twenty-nine private iron factories organized by the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Society to manufacture waterwheels have largely completed the first batch of over one thousand five hundred units, and they have already been loaned to farmers for use. The society recently placed an order with the factories for a second batch of waterwheels, totaling over seven hundred units. Factories that previously undertook manufacturing, such as Dong Shunxing and Yixing, have good product quality and are better able to meet the contractual requirements. The number of units they are undertaking this time has increased by two or four times compared to the previous order. The output of these factories in these three to four months, across the two batches, is equivalent to the output of the two years before liberation. However, some factories, due to only producing guns and cannons or other machines for the Kuomintang reactionaries before liberation, are not skilled in the techniques of manufacturing waterwheels, resulting in delayed deliveries and poor quality. However, these difficulties are gradually being overcome. In addition, individual factories such as Haiquan and Xingji are deliberately delaying, harboring deceptive intentions. These two factories initially undertook to manufacture a total of twenty waterwheels, but after receiving ninety percent of the deposit, they consistently refused to purchase raw materials and begin manufacturing, diverting the deposit for other purposes. When the deadline for delivery arrived, they failed to deliver the goods. After the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Society investigated and discovered this, they criticized and educated them. The managers of the two factories, Li Haiquan and Xing Baolin, both admitted their mistakes and guaranteed to deliver the goods within a twenty-day extension. When the second extended deadline expired, the two factories each only delivered half of the order. The North China Water Conservancy Promotion Society had no choice but to hand the matter over to the judicial authorities for resolution. After interrogation by the Public Security Bureau, the case has been transferred to the court for processing.

　　华北水利推进社
  　续订水车七百余辆
    个别工厂拖延交货将受制裁
    【本市讯】本市二十余家私营铁工厂由于生产面向农村，业务日趋发达。但有个别厂主存在欺骗企图，将受制裁。华北水利推进总社所组织的二十九家私营铁工厂制造水车，首批一千五百余辆，已大部制造完成，并已贷给农民使用。现该社已于日前向各厂订制第二批水车，共七百余辆。前次承造的工厂如东顺兴、义兴等厂，成品质量好，较能符合契约上的规定，此次承造数量较上次增多一倍或四倍。这几家工厂在这三、四个月中的两批产量，已相当于解放前两年的产量。但其中一部分工厂由于解放前只给国民党反动派造枪炮或生产其他机器，转造水车后技术不熟练，所以交货延期，品质也差，不过这些困难也逐渐克服。另外尚有海泉、邢记等个别工厂，则故意拖延，存在着欺骗的企图，该两厂首批共承造水车二十辆，但拿到九成订款后，始终不肯购进原料动手制造，把订款移作别用，到期交不出货，经华北水利推进总社检查出来，予以批评教育，该两厂经理李海泉、邢宝霖都承认错误，保证延期二十天交货。及至第二次限期期满，两厂各只交出半数，华北水利推进总社乃不得不将此事交付司法机关解决，经公安局讯明后，已将此案转法院处理。
