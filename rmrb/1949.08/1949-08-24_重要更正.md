　　Important Corrections
    The following corrections are made to the "Seven Decisions Regarding the Suggestions of the First North China Workers' Representative Conference Announced by the North China People's Government on August 10th" (as reported in the Tianjin and Beijing newspapers up to August 18th) issued by this office: In the second item of the "Decision of the North China People's Government on the Administrative Division of Major Industrial and Mining Areas in North China and the Establishment of Administrative Organizations," the phrase "county labor section" should be removed.

    　Information Office of the North China People's Government
    In the August 20th dispatch "Completion of the Soviet Martyrs Memorial Tower in Ang'angxi" (published on page one of this newspaper on August 21st), the phrase "more than 700 people from provincial and municipal government agencies, organizations, railway bureaus, and Soviet expatriates" should read "more than 5,000 people from provincial and municipal government agencies, organizations, railway bureaus, representatives from all walks of life, and Soviet expatriates."
    In the August 22nd dispatch (published on page one of this newspaper on August 23rd) regarding the People's Liberation Army Headquarters' announcement of the regimental numbers of the enemy regular army divisions annihilated in July, the "247th Division directly under the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters" is a mistake for the "247th Division directly under the Northwest Military and Political Chief's Office."
