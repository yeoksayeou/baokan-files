[Baoding Electric] Since the Provincial Party Committee issued the call for production and disaster relief, Party and government organs and organizations in various disaster areas have used all possible means and various methods to lead the disaster-stricken people in launching a production self-relief movement. The organs in Tongxian Special Zone have dispatched 76 capable cadres to 10 key counties; Baoding Special Zone has dispatched 24 cadres, led by the Deputy Commissioner and the Director of Public Security, to Zhuoxian, Xincheng and other places to lead the masses in blocking breaches, draining water, and rushing to plant buckwheat and vegetables. Miyun and Xianghe counties in Tongxian Special Zone allocated 95,000 jin of relief grain to provide focused and urgent assistance to disaster victims, and mobilized the masses to lend and borrow seeds from each other. Xianghe and Huairou counties have lent out 41,000 jin of buckwheat seeds and distributed more than 800 jin of radish seeds. Wuyi used buckwheat seeds to exchange with the masses. In Shunyi County, the Second District selected 13 drainage ditches, freeing up 15,000 mu of land. In Sanhe, more than 10,000 mu of buckwheat have been planted, and a considerable amount of buckwheat and vegetables have also been planted on land freed from water in other disaster areas. Some other disaster areas have begun to organize various sideline productions. The Pingxi and Pingbei administrative authorities used the method of determining goods based on grain to absorb local mountain products, solving the difficulty of food shortage, and organized farmers to dig medicinal materials in large quantities and organize exports in exchange for grain. In Jixian Qingdianwa and other places, the masses have begun to be organized to fish, weave mats, and transport goods, and women are sewing shoe soles. Tangshan Special Zone is also mobilizing the masses to catch fish and shrimp, and hunt ducks and geese in areas near rivers and large canals. Under the leadership and promotion of the government, more than 5,700 households in three districts of Qingxian have started weaving straw braid. In order to vigorously support the textile industry to overcome famine, the Raoyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative lent thread to the disaster victims and purchased large quantities of homespun cloth. In Nankongcheng village alone, there were 97 looms and 360 spinning wheels in operation. The Jianguo Supply and Marketing Cooperative is preparing to lend 80,000 jin of grain in exchange for farmers' cotton and mountain jujubes. In addition to production for self-relief in various ways, some areas have also launched mutual assistance and mutual relief among the masses. According to statistics from the first, second, third, and fourth districts of Qingxian alone, 896 households borrowed grain from each other among the masses. In the fifth, ninth, tenth, and third districts, 5,088 households exchanged fine grains for coarse grains, accounting for more than twice the number of households in the entire district, which helped the development of production and disaster relief.
