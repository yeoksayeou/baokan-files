Literature and Politics
Lai Suqiesiji
Translated by Hua Mingjie

    Lenin's principle of Party spirit in literature, put forward in his 1905 article "Party Organization and Party Literature," is a great contribution to literary theory and has played a decisive role in the creation and development of art in the revolutionary working class and later in socialist society.

    In class society, no literature, art, or science can be "detached" and independent of the class struggle, and therefore "detached" and independent of the policies of one class or another. Lenin said: "It is impossible to live in society and be free from society. The freedom of bourgeois writers, artists, and actors is nothing more than a secret (or hypocritically decorated) dependence on the purse, bribery, and subsidies."

    Lenin pointed out that the false propaganda of "freedom of art" divorced from politics is a bourgeois concept. Its purpose is to deceive the people and conceal the dependence of bourgeois art on the policies of capitalists. To conceal this dependence, bourgeois thinkers raise a smokescreen, manifested in false slogans such as the "non-partisanship" of art, the "freedom" and "independence" of art, and the detachment of art from political struggle.

    Although they clamor that their works are detached from politics, they diligently carry out propaganda beneficial to the policies of imperialism and tirelessly instill reactionary and anti-people ideas into readers. The empty talk of "art for art's sake" and "freedom of creative endeavor" is intended not only to deceive the broad masses but also to confuse and deceive those honest cultural workers who are politically inexperienced. If a writer allows himself to be fascinated by the theory of "art for art's sake" and attempts to stand aloof from the class struggle, he will inevitably become a prisoner of capitalist ideology permeating bourgeois countries without realizing it.

    Only writers who hold high the policies expressing the interests and ideals of millions of ordinary people in their works can truly serve the people and the cause of progress.

    The working class is organized to resist those lies. They are forward-looking, and their policy is to accelerate the historical process and liberate the working people. Literature, organically combined with the interests of all working people, is a powerful weapon in the struggle for the victory of this great cause. The Communist Party openly declares that progressive literature is directly linked to the revolutionary policy of the working class. This is truly free literature, because it serves the struggle to win the complete liberation of the masses and the true freedom of the entire working class.

    After Lenin's death, the Bolshevik Party, headed by Stalin, further developed the principle of Party spirit in literature as one of Lenin's great doctrines.

    In putting forward the principle of Party spirit in literature, Lenin emphasized: "Literary work must become a part of the entire proletarian cause." The Soviet Communist Party has realized this slogan in life. Today, in the Soviet Union, a socialist country in which antagonistic classes no longer exist, and the people are united morally and politically, literature is an organic component of the entire people's cause. Therefore, it has no interests other than the interests of the Soviet people. The principle of Party spirit in literature lies in fighting for this interest, which is manifested in the policies of the Soviet state.

    Marxism-Leninism believes that social consciousness is determined by material life and in turn exerts an active influence on material life. This is often the case. However, in Soviet society, the role of social consciousness has greatly increased compared to all previous eras. The Soviet people have completed the leap from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom, as Engels once predicted. They are no longer slaves of the spontaneous forces of social development but their masters. The development of Soviet society, as we know, is not carried out spontaneously but is organized and planned.

    It is guided by the policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, which are formulated based on a scientific understanding of the laws of historical development and with the interests of the people as the primary concern. This policy has won the support of the entire Soviet people, who, under the leadership of the Party, implement it in life. As Lenin pointed out: "Only the masses can formulate true policies."

    The consciousness of the broad masses is of decisive importance here, and therefore the Communist Party attaches great importance to mass education. Soviet literature naturally plays a major role in this regard. Stalin described writers as engineers of the human soul. But to educate the masses, writers themselves must deeply understand the policies of the Soviet government and implement them fully and rapidly in life.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union made this very clear in its 1946 decision on literary and artistic issues. It sharply criticized the attitude of indifference to thought and politics and put forward clear and rich principles of artistic activity to achieve further advancement and prosperity of literature.

    The Party's decision on literary and artistic magazines pointed out: "...Our magazines are a powerful tool for the Soviet state to educate the Soviet people, especially the youth, and therefore they must be guided by the policies that constitute the lifeblood of the Soviet system." Regarding the performance programs of theaters, the decision said: "...Only by actively promoting the policies of the Soviet state that constitute the lifeblood of the Soviet system can the Soviet theater fulfill its important task of educating the working people."

    Therefore, the Party particularly emphasizes the great significance of mass education. Ideological education of the working people and overcoming the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness are of decisive importance in the period of gradual transition from socialism to communism, that is, in the current period of Soviet social life. Therefore, the educational role of literature must also be strengthened.

    Socialist realism means a faithful depiction of life, a truthful reproduction of reality. Is there any contradiction between this and the requirement that artistic works be guided by policy? Not at all. A writer can only give a true and profound depiction of reality (in its revolutionary development) when he himself is guided by the policies of the Soviet state. Because what is this policy based on? It is based on knowledge of the real needs of the development of the material life of society; on a scientific knowledge of reality and its laws of development.

    Lenin said: "Marxism must base its policies solely on facts that have been accurately and irrefutably verified." This is the foundation of the Soviet government's policy. It (policy) proceeds from reality and returns to reality, is embodied in life, and transforms life. Policy and reality are a dialectical unity in the Soviet Union. The ideals of the people expressed in the policies of the Soviet government are consistent with the objective development of reality and push it forward.

    Naturally, the writer, as an artist, must directly observe the facts of life. He observes facts and phenomena, selects them, and embodies them in images, according to the characteristics of his artistic personality. Without this, there would be no art. But at the same time, Soviet writers must approach the facts of life from a political point of view and evaluate them. Without this, there can be no true socialist realism. Without this, it is impossible to correctly observe and express human activity or the inner world of the people. Because the work done by the Soviet people is to translate the policies of the Soviet state into life.

    Only writers who organically combine artistic and political viewpoints can faithfully describe the development process of life and the people, and can be competent to "express the new and noble qualities of the Soviet people, not only to express our people today, but also to look into the future and help illuminate the path forward..." (Zhdanov).

    What does it mean to be a politician? Lenin instructed us that it means "to analyze phenomena not from an individual point of view but from a mass point of view," "to study those phenomena from the point of view of millions of people and the relationships between millions of people."

    Only such a position can ensure that the writer does not narrowly approach life, does not commit various subjective errors, does not act like a naturalist taking photographs, and does not describe reality in the distorted mirror of accidental impressions. A writer who abandons this position will make erroneous treatments of phenomena.

    For example, a person once committed the crime of betrayal out of fear of death. If the writer approaches this fact from the point of view of this person who is afraid of death, he will prove that this act of betrayal is excusable, or, in any case, he cannot make a judgment that he deserves punishment. This would inevitably distort the authenticity of artistic depiction. However, if the writer judges this fact from the point of view of the people, "from the point of view of millions of people and the relationships between millions of people," the result will be completely different. He will reveal the truth of the crime committed by the coward against society and the attitude of the people towards him. Lenin once said: "In a personal sense, the difference between a traitor who betrays due to cowardice and a traitor who betrays deliberately is very great. In a political sense, there is no such difference, because politics means the practical destiny of millions of people, and for this destiny, it makes no difference to the millions of workers and poor peasants who are betrayed by the traitor whether the traitor betrays out of cowardice or out of greed."

    Therefore, the artistic, intellectual, and educational significance of a literary work depends on the degree of political maturity and firmness of the writer, and on the correctness of his observation and judgment of facts from the perspective of the main trends in the development of life. As we know, the greater the artistic power of a work, the more realistic the characters depicted in it, the closer they are to life, the more truthful they are, and the more fully and profoundly they embody typical, new, and growing characters.

    文学与政治
    莱苏切夫斯基
    华明节译
    列宁于一九○五年在“党的组织与党的文学”一文中所提出的文学党性原则，对于文学理论是一个巨大贡献，而且在革命工人阶级以及后来社会主义社会的艺术之创造与发展上，曾经起了决定作用。
    在阶级社会中，没有任何文学，艺术或科学能够“超然”与独立于阶级斗争之外，因而“超然”与独立于这一阶级或那一阶级的政策之外。列宁说：“生活于社会之中而又超脱于社会之外，是不可能的。资产阶级作家、艺术家、剧人的自由，不过是对于钱袋、收买、津贴之秘密的（或虚伪地装饰着的）依赖而已。”
    列宁指出：离开政治的“艺术自由”的虚伪宣传，是一种资产阶级观念。其目的是要欺骗人民，掩饰与隐蔽资产阶级艺术之对资本家政策的依赖。为了遮蔽这种依赖，资产阶级的思想家就扯起了一种烟幕，其表现形态就是什么艺术的“无党派性”，艺术的“自由”与“独立”，艺术的超然于政治斗争之外等等虚伪口号。
    他们虽然叫嚷着他们的作品是超然于政治之外的，可是他们却勤勤恳恳地进行着有利于帝国主义政策的宣传，孜孜不倦地向读者灌注反动的与反人民的观念。那种所谓“为艺术而艺术”与“创造努力的自由”之空谈，不仅是打算着要去欺骗广大群众，而且也打算着要去搅昏与欺骗那些在政治上没有经验的诚实的文化工作者。一个作家如果让他自己着迷于“为艺术而艺术”的理论，而企图超然于阶级斗争之上，就一定会不知不觉地变成弥漫于资产阶级国家的资本主义思想的俘虏。
    只有在作品中高举着表现千百万普通人民的利益和理想的政策的作家，才真正能够为人民与进步事业服务。
    工人阶级是有组织地抗御那些谎言的。他们是向前看的，他们的政策是去加速历史进程，解放劳动人民的。与全体劳动人民的利益有机地结合着的文学，是在为这个伟大事业之胜利而斗争的一个强有力的武器。共产党公开宣告进步文学是与工人阶级的革命政策直接联系的。这才是一种真正自由的文学，因为它是为争取群众之完全解放，为整个工人阶级之真正自由的斗争服务的。
    在列宁死后，以斯大林为首的布尔什维克党，更进一步发展了作为列宁的伟大教义之一的文学党性原则。
    在提出文学党性原则时，列宁强调地说：“文学事业必须成为整个无产阶级事业的一部分。”苏联共产党已把这个口号实现于生活之中。今天在苏联，这个社会主义国家，在其中对立的诸阶级已不复存在，人民在道德上政治上都已统一起来了的国家，文学是整个人民事业的一个有机组成部分。因此，它除了苏维埃人民的利益外，没有其他利益。文学党性的原则，就是在于为这种利益而斗争，而这种利益则是表现在苏维埃国家的政策之中。
    马克思列宁主义认为：社会意识是为物质生活所决定，转而又给予物质生活以主动的影响。常常正是那样。但在苏维埃社会中，社会意识的作用，与从前一切时代比较起来，是大大地增长了。苏联人民已经完成了恩格斯所曾预言的从必然王国到自由王国的跳跃。他们不再是社会发展之自发势力的奴隶，而是他们的主人了。苏维埃社会的发展，如我们所知道的，不是自发地进行着的，而是有组织地按照计划去进行的。
    它是为共产党与苏维埃国家的政策所指导的，这种政策是根据对于历史发展规律之科学的认识，及以人民利益为第一关心的事情而制订出来的。这种政策获得了整个苏维埃人民的拥护，苏维埃人民在党的领导下把它实现在生活之中。如列宁所指出的：“只有群众才能制订真正的政策。”
    广大群众的觉悟在这里具有决定的重要性，因此，共产党对于群众教育赋予以重大意义。苏维埃文学自然而然地要在这方面起一种重大作用。斯大林曾把作家形容为人类灵魂的工程师。但要教育群众，作家自己必须深刻了解苏维埃政府的政策，圆满地迅速地把它实现在生活之中。
    苏联共产党中央委员会把这一点很清楚地写在一九四六年关于文艺问题的决定中。它尖锐地斥责对于思想、对于政治之漠不关心的态度，并提出了明白而鸿富的艺术活动原则，以求达到文学之更进一步的前进与繁荣。
    在党的关于文艺杂志的决定中指出：“……我们的杂志是苏维埃国家教育苏维埃人民特别是青年的一种有力工具，因此它们必须为构成苏维埃制度之生命基础的政策所指导”。关于剧场的上演节目，决定中说：“……苏维埃剧场只有积极宣传构成苏维埃制度之生命基础的苏维埃国家的政策，才能执行其教育劳动人民的重要任务。”
    因此，党特别强调广大群众教育的重大意义。对劳动人民进行思想教育，克服人们意识中资本主义的残余，在从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义时期，就是说，在现在的苏维埃社会生活的时期，具有决定的重要意义。因此，文学的教育作用也必须加强。
    社会主义的现实主义，意即生活之忠实的描写，现实之真实的再生产。在这一点与对艺术作品要为政策所指导的要求之间，是否有什么矛盾呢？一点也没有。作家只有在他自己为苏维埃国家的政策所指导时，才能够对于现实（在其革命的发展中）给予一个真实而深刻的描写。因为这种政策是放在什么基础上的？是放在对于社会物质生活之发展的真正需要的知识上；放在现实及其发展规律之科学的知识上。
    列宁说：“马克思主义必须把它的政策仅仅放在确切地与无可争辩地被证实了的事实的基础上。”这是苏维埃政府政策的基础。它（政策）是从现实出发而又转向现实，被体现在生活之中而又变革生活。政策与现实在苏联是一个辩证的统一。表现在苏维埃政府的政策中的人民的理想，是与现实之客观发展相一致，而又把它推向前进。
    自然，作家，作为一个艺术家，要直接去观察生活事实。他注意观察事实与现象，选择之，在形象中体现之，是按照他的艺术家个性的特点去作的。没有这一点，也就没有艺术。但同时，苏维埃作家要从政治观点去接近生活事实，加以评价。没有这一点，也不能有真正的社会主义的现实主义。没有这一点，要正确观察与表现人类活动或人民的内在世界，是不可能的。因为苏维埃人民所作的工作，就是把苏维埃国家的政策翻译成为生活。
    只有把艺术观点与政治观点有机地结合起来的作家，才能忠实地描写生活与人民的发展过程，才能胜任“去表现苏维埃人民之新的高尚品质，不仅要表现我们今天的人民，而且也要透视将来，帮助着去照耀前进的路道……”（日丹诺夫）。
    要作一个政治家，是什么意思呢？列宁指示我们，这意思就是说，“不是从个人观点，而是从群众观点”去分析现象，“从千百万人民的观点和千百万人民之间的关系”去研究那些现象。
    只有这样一种立场，才能保证作家不致狭隘地去接近生活，不致犯各种各样主观主义的错误，不致象自然主义者的照像一样，不致在偶然印象的歪曲镜子中去描写现实。放弃这种立场的作家，就会对于现象发生错误的处理。
    举一个例子。一个人曾经因为怕死而犯了叛变的罪行。假若作家是从这个怕死者的观点去接近这一事实，他会去证明此种叛变行为是情有可原，或者，无论如何，他也不能下一个罪有应得的判定。这样就不得不歪曲艺术描写的真实性。然而，假若作家是从人民的观点，“从千百万人民的观点与在千百万人民之间的关系”去评判这个事实，那结果将会完全不同。他将会揭露该怕死者对于社会所犯罪行的真相和人民对他的态度。列宁曾经说过：“从个人意义上说，在一个由于懦弱而发生叛变的叛徒与一个蓄意叛变的叛徒之间的差别是很大的。从政治意义上说，就没有这样的差别，因为政治是意味着千百万人民的实际命运，对于这种命运，千百万工人和贫农为叛徒所出卖，究竟是由于叛徒之怯懦怕死而出卖的，还是由于叛徒之利欲薰心而出卖的，那是没有什么差别的。”
    因此，一种文学作品之艺术的，以及智力的和教育的意义大小如何，依赖于作家在政治上的成熟与坚定的程度，依赖于他从生活发展的主要趋势的见地去观察与评判事实的正确程度。如我们所知道的，一种作品，假若在其中所描写的人物愈现实，愈接近生活，愈真实，他们体现典型的，新的，正在生长着的人物愈圆满，愈深刻，则这种作品的艺术力量也愈大。
