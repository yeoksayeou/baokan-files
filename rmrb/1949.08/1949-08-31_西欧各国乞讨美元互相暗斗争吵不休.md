   Like Britain, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Denmark and other Western European countries which have also encountered a serious dollar crisis, are not only quarreling with their master because of the United States' fierce extortion, but also secretly fighting each other for "US aid." The Netherlands and Italy firmly opposed the British delegation's request to allocate most of the second phase of Marshall Plan funding to Britain, and Britain also protested against the huge funding requirements proposed by the Netherlands. Within the American ruling class, due to the increasingly deteriorating economic situation and the failure of its foreign aggressive policies everywhere, major contradictions have also arisen in the specific methods of implementing this policy. On the 18th, as a result of a vote in the US House of Representatives, the appropriation for the Truman administration's plan to supply armaments to countries under the North Atlantic Treaty was cut in half. This event reflects that the US war preparation plan has encountered increasing difficulties and resistance.

　　西欧各国乞讨美元互相暗斗争吵不休
    和英国同样遭遇严重美元危机的意、法、荷、丹等西欧各国，不仅因美国的凶狠勒索而和他的主人发生争吵，而且还因争相乞讨“美援”而互相暗斗。荷兰、意大利坚决反对英国代表团要求把马歇尔计划第二期拨款大部拨给英国，英国也抗议荷兰所提出的巨大拨款要求。在美国统治阶级内部，由于经济情况愈益恶化，对外侵略政策到处失败的结果，也在执行这个政策的具体方法上发生了重大矛盾。十八日，美国众院表决的结果，把杜鲁门政府以军备供给北大西洋公约国家计划的拨款，削减了一半。这件事，反映了美国战争准备计划已遭受愈来愈大的困难和阻力。
