　　Yuehan Railway Workers
  　Heroically Protected the Railway Before Liberation

    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 20th: The Yuehan Railway workers waged a sharp and victorious struggle against the White bandits to protect the railway and materials before the liberation of Changsha. When the White bandits destroyed eight bridges between Yueyang and Miluo in mid-July and were about to destroy the Baishui Bridge, the workers at the Quanshanping Station destroyed a section of the railway south of the station, preventing White bandit trains from passing through, and the Baishui Bridge was preserved intact. The railway workers in the Changsha section organized themselves when the White bandits fled south from Wuhan. They evaded the surveillance of special agents and bandits by various means, dismantling parts of good locomotives and hiding some of them outside the station. They also packed many tools and parts into boxes, affixed seals marked "Under Orders for Southern Relocation," loaded them onto cars, and secretly transported and hid them at night. Two technicians, disregarding all difficulties and dangers, went to Zhuzhou, Sanmen and other places to sabotage the tracks, causing train No. 25, fleeing south, to derail between Sanmen and Lukou. Other workers delayed repairs, thus preventing many trains from heading south. Yuehan Railway employees protected a total of 32 locomotives, 240 carriages, 200 tons of machinery, oil, and tools, and preserved many large and small bridges and roadbeds from destruction by various means. Thanks to the heroic protection by the railway workers before liberation and their full cooperation with the People's Liberation Army in rushing repairs after liberation, the Yuehan Railway between Miluo and Lukou has resumed traffic.

    [Another Dispatch] Mail, telegrams, and telephones between Changsha and Shanghai and Hankou are now open.

　　粤汉铁路职工
  　解放前英勇护路
    【新华社长沙二十日电】粤汉路职工为保护铁路和资材在长沙解放前与白匪进行了尖锐的胜利的斗争。当白匪在七月中旬破坏了岳阳至汨罗间的八道桥梁又要着手破坏白水桥时，圈山坪车站的工人，便把车站以南的一段铁路破坏，使白匪列车不能通过，白水桥乃得以完整保存。长沙段铁路工人，在白匪自武汉南逃时便组织起来，以种种方法逃过特务匪徒的监视，把好的机车一部分拆掉零件，一部分开到站外隐藏起来。他们又将许多工具、零件装箱，贴上“奉命南迁”的封条，装到车上，一到深夜便偷偷运走和隐藏起来。有两个技术工人，不顾一切困难和危险，到株州、三门等处破坏路轨，使南逃列车二十五号在三门和渌口间出轨，其他工人则迟延着不去修理，因而使许多列车不能南开。粤汉路员工以各种方法，共保护了三十二个机车、二百四十辆车皮、二百吨机件、油料和工具，保全了许多大小桥梁与路基未被破坏。由于铁路工人在解放前的英勇保护和解放后全力配合解放军抢修，粤汉路汨罗至渌口间已恢复通车。
