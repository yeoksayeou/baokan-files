    A Microcosm of Zhangjiakou Industry
    Our Newspaper Reports on the Zhangjiakou Industrial Exhibition
    [Our Newspaper News] The Zhangjiakou Public and Private Industry and Handicraft Product Exhibition began in the early part of this month. This is a grand review of Zhangjiakou's industrial production and the strength of its workers. More than half a year has passed since the liberation of Zhangjiakou. Thanks to the vigorous leadership of the Provincial and Municipal People's Governments in restoring and developing production, and the correct implementation of industrial and commercial policies, Zhangjiakou's public and private industrial production has shown significant progress. Outside the exhibition hall, eye-catching machines are on display: the 18-inch shaper and the 4-foot circular lathe are the latest products of the Zhangyuan Machine Factory. This factory, formerly the Kuomintang bandit gang's "Comprehensive Machine Factory," has 300 machines. Last winter, before our army attacked the Ping-Sui Railway, the enemy, seeing that Zhangjiakou would return to the hands of the people, moved all the machines to Tianjin, and the workers were also coerced to go there. After the liberation of Tianjin, the factory was ordered to move back to Zhangjiakou and took on the task of manufacturing machine tools and repairing machine parts.

    From the exhibited samples, it can be seen that the owners and workers of many private factories are also working hard to study technology and improve product quality. The steel plate grinder produced by the private Deshun Iron Factory has been greatly improved compared to the steel plate grinders originally produced in Tianjin and Beijing. Wind holes and channels have been added to the grinding disc to dissipate heat and reduce dust. A spring has been added to the tightening and loosening turntable to reduce resistance and accelerate rotation, increasing the daily output by nearly double that of the old-fashioned steel plate grinder. The rice milling machine produced by the factory can mill twelve dan of gaoliang per day. The ball-bearing wagon axle can carry two tons. These industries are closely integrated with agricultural production, and their future is extremely bright.

    The exhibits in the first exhibition hall are mostly products of the ten factories under the jurisdiction of the Chahar Provincial Enterprise Corporation, including oil pressing, brewing, glassware, rubber, flour, cigarettes, and food. The second largest group of exhibits are the tweed produced by the Zhangjiakou Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Woolen Mill, and hand-spun carpet yarn. The glassware produced by the Zhangyuan Glassware Factory is beautiful and exquisite, with more than 30 styles. The rubber shoes, rubber soles, rubber tubes, and rubber belts produced by the Zhangyuan Rubber Factory are of higher quality than during the Japanese occupation. From the comparative table of increased production in each factory of the Enterprise Corporation, the Zhangyuan Vegetable Oil Factory has achieved the greatest increase in production. From January to May, the monthly output increased from 10,000 jin to 95,000 jin, an increase of more than eight times compared to before liberation. The 95-proof industrial alcohol produced by the Zhangyuan Brewing Factory can replace gasoline as fuel. The factory officially resumed work in January this year. According to statistics up to the end of April, the monthly output increased to 24,500 jin, greatly exceeding the highest production level of 15,000 jin to 19,000 jin per month before liberation. The factory is also striving to standardize sesame oil for large-scale export.

    The second exhibition hall displays coarse and fine leather, furs, felt shoes and hats, saddles, cart and horse ropes, farm tools, daily necessities, as well as Mongolian boots and raw tobacco produced by private industrial and handicraft workshops. From these exhibits, it can be seen that Zhangyuan is still a distribution center for fur, grain, and Mongolian-Han trade. On the wall hangs a "Comparison Table of the Number of Zhangjiakou Private Industrial and Handicraft Workshops Before and After Liberation," which shows that the number of operating households has increased by 30.27% in the half year since liberation.

    张家口工业缩影
    本报记者报导张市工业展览
    【本报讯】张家口公、私营工业及手工业产品展览会于本月上旬开始。这是张家口工业生产和工人力量的一次大检阅。张市解放半年多了，由于省、市人民政府大力领导恢复与发展生产，正确执行了工商业政策，使张市公、私营工业生产，呈现了显著的进步。展览室外陈列着使人注目的机器：十八时的牛头刨床、四英尺圆车都是张垣机器厂的最新出品。该厂前身为国民党匪帮的“综合机器厂”，拥有机器三百部。去冬我军进击平绥路前，敌人眼看张家口将重归人民之手，曾将全部机器迁往天津，工人亦被挟持前去，天津解放后，该厂奉命迁回张市，担负起制造工作母机与修配机件的任务。
    从展览样品中看出许多私营工厂的厂主与工人也正在努力研究技术，提高产品质量。私营德顺铁工厂出品的钢板磨粉机，较原来平津出品之钢板磨有着很大改进，磨盘上增加了风孔风道，可以扬粉减热，定松紧用的转盘上，增装了弹簧，可以减少阻力加速旋转，较旧式钢板磨的日产量提高近一倍，该厂出品之碾米机，能日碾高粮十二石，装有滚珠的马车轴，能载重两吨。广荣铁工厂制造的新式铡草机，一人一日能铡两千斤，这些工业和农业生产密切结合，前途至为光大。
    第一展览室陈列的展览品，绝大部分是察省企业公司所属榨油、酿造、料器、橡胶、面粉、纸烟、食品等十个工厂的出品，其次是张市供销社毛织工厂出品的平呢，及人工纺的地毯毛线等。张垣料器厂出品的玻璃器，美观精致，样式有三十余种，张垣橡胶厂所产胶鞋、胶底、胶管、胶带，产品质量高于日寇占据时期。从企业公司各厂增产的比较表上看来，张垣植物油厂增产成绩最大，从一月份至五月份，月产量由一万斤上升到九万五千斤。较解放前增加八倍多。张垣酿造厂制造的九十五度的工业酒精，可以代替汽油作燃料，该厂今年一月份正式复工，截止四月底统计，月产量增加到二万四千五百斤，大大超过解放前月产量一万五千斤到一万九千斤的最高生产水平，所制胡麻油为了大量输出，更在力求标准化。
    第二展览室陈列着私营工业手工业作坊出品之粗细皮革、皮裘、毡鞋毡帽、鞍＠、车马绳套，农具、日常用具以及蒙民用的蒙靴、生烟，从这些展览品看，张垣仍不失为皮毛、粮食及蒙汉贸易的集散地。墙上挂着“张市私营工业手工业作坊解放前后户数比较表”，说明解放后半年以来，经营户数较解放前增加了百分之三十点二七。（吕光明）
