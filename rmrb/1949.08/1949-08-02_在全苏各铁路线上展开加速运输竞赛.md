Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 1st: Moscow dispatch: Soviet railway workers are celebrating the Railway Workers' Day on July 31st with even greater labor achievements. They are intensifying the competition to better utilize vehicles and accelerate vehicle transportation. Currently, 1,600 drivers are able to drive fully loaded trains an average of 500 kilometers per day, with some drivers increasing this to 800 kilometers per day. Each railway has organized Stakhanovite teams to ensure the fastest possible transport of goods. All railway workers are participating in the competition. Many railways have greatly exceeded their freight transport plans. The head of the Estonian Railway Bureau reported at a commemorative meeting in Tallinn that local transport has exceeded the 1950 plan, and the total freight volume is double that of the pre-war period.

Soviet railways had already reached pre-war freight levels last year. The average daily transport volume of railways in the first quarter of this year increased by 16.5 percent compared to the same period last year, and the second quarter increased by 17 percent compared to the same period last year. The railways are gradually being equipped with new locomotives and wagons. The production of rails in the second quarter of this year increased by 90 percent compared to the same period last year, locomotives by 11 percent, electric locomotives by 130 percent, and wagons by 51 percent. Over the past thirty years, the new railway lines built by the Soviet state have contributed to the strong cultural and economic upsurge in many remote areas of the Soviet Union. To give an example, since the establishment of the Soviet government, the railway network in Kazakhstan has tripled, Tajikistan has increased by two and a half times, and Azerbaijan has doubled. By the time the post-war Five-Year Plan is completed, the Soviet railway network will be extended by several thousand kilometers, and the transport volume will exceed three times the total pre-war railway freight volume of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan.

    在全苏各铁路线上展开加速运输竞赛
    【新华社北平一日电】莫斯科讯：苏联铁路职工以更大的劳动成绩庆祝七月三十一日的铁路职工节。他们正加紧开展更好地利用车辆、加速车辆运输的竞赛运动。现在共有一千六百名司机平均每人每天能驾驶装载足量的列车走五百公里，有些司机已提高每天八百公里。各铁路都已组织了斯塔哈诺夫队，保证最迅速地运输货物。全部铁路职工都参加了竞赛。许多铁路都已大大超过了运货计划。爱沙尼亚铁路局长在塔林的纪念会上报告称：此间的载运业已超过一九五○年计划，而运货总量已为战前的一倍。
    苏联铁路去年就已达到战前货运水平。铁路每日平均载运量今年第一季又比去年同期增加了百分之十六点五，今年第二季比去年同期增加了百分之十七。各铁路逐渐装配新的机车与车皮。今年第二季铁轨产量比去年同期增加了百分之九十，机车百分之十一，电气机车百分之一百三十，车皮百分之五十一。三十年来，苏维埃国家建筑的新铁路线对苏联许多辽远地区强有力的文化与经济高涨是有贡献的。举一个例子，从苏维埃政府成立以来，哈萨克斯坦的铁路网增加了三倍，塔吉克斯坦增加两倍半，阿塞拜疆增加一倍。到战后五年计划完成时，苏联铁路网将再延长好几千公里，运输量将超过英、法、德、意、日五国战前铁路货运量总和的三倍。
