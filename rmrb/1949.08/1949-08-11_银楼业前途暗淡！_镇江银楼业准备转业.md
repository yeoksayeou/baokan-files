    Silversmithing Industry's Future Bleak!
    Zhenjiang Silversmiths Prepare to Switch Trades
    [Zhenjiang News] There are thirty silversmith shops in this city. Since the East China Military Region promulgated the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Gold and Silver" on June 13th, the silversmiths, realizing that their business has no future development after liberation, learned from the newspapers that silversmiths in North China had switched to operating rubber and other businesses, which met the needs of the new society and yielded much better business results than the original silversmithing business. Therefore, they broke through the "insiders fear doing outsider's business" concerns of the silversmithing industry in this city. Afterwards, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce sent people to patiently explain the government's care for industry and commerce and various economic policies to the silversmiths, and enlightened them to immediately abandon their wait-and-see attitude and invest their useful capital in productive enterprises. In the past week, the silversmiths are planning to switch to industries such as rubber, general merchandise, and cotton yarn. According to preliminary statistics, there are twenty silversmith shops already preparing to switch trades, including Lao Feng Xiang and Wen Yuan. For example, Wen Yuan Silversmith is preparing to open a sock factory and switch to the production sector.

    银楼业前途暗淡！
    镇江银楼业准备转业
    【镇江讯】本市银楼业共有三十家，自六月十三日华东军区颁布金银管理暂行办法后，鉴于银楼在解放后已无业务发展前途。他们从报上看到华北银楼业转营橡胶等业的消息，因适合新社会的需要，其营业收获，比原来银楼业务要好得多，因此打破了本市银楼业的“内行怕做外行生意”的顾虑。后经工商局派人向各银楼耐心说明政府对工商业的爱护和各项经济政策，并启示各银楼应立即抛弃观望态度，把有用资本投到生产事业中去。近一周来，各银楼正计划向橡胶、百货、棉纱等业转业。经初步统计，已在准备转业的银楼，计有老凤祥、文元等二十家，其中如文元银楼，正预备开设袜子厂，转入生产部门。
