    Telecom Bureau Answers Citizens' Questions (Continued from Yesterday)
    2. What is the profit and loss situation of your business since liberation or in the last three months? What are the reasons?
    In the past three months (April to June), our profit and loss situation is as follows: In April, because we had just taken over, the focus of our work was only on maintaining the status quo, and we did not carry out repairs and expansion work, so the income was sufficient to maintain expenses, and there was no loss. May was different. In late April, the price of millet increased, and the original price could no longer maintain expenses. Although the prices of telegrams and telephone calls were appropriately adjusted on May 10, the expenses also increased. Domestically, we had to repair the bureau buildings before the rainy season and restore the work that had been sabotaged by special agents. For example, the long-distance trunk line from Liulihe to Yongle was sabotaged by special agents six times in May alone. In addition, appropriate reconstruction work was carried out. For example, two buildings of the Huangcun receiving station were demolished by bandit troops, and a huge sum of money had to be allocated for repairs. Thus, the summary of revenue and expenditure at the end of May showed a loss of 1,951,394.57 yuan, excluding construction costs, which still had to be invested by the government. In June, we had to appropriately increase the prices of telegrams and telephone calls again. On June 5, the prices of telegrams and telephone calls were calculated at 60 yuan per catty of millet, but this was still at least 5 yuan lower than the market price at the time, and more than half the current price (end of July). Thus, June was just enough to cover expenses. However, the huge construction costs still had to be invested by the government. For example, we estimate that the construction cost of the Daxing transmitting station will amount to over 200 million yuan at the current price. Due to the urgent need of the near future, we have to do it. This major project is now being actively prepared for construction. Although our enterprise should be self-sufficient for such huge construction costs, we have to rely on government investment in order to take care of the users' burden, instead of adding it to the users. This is very obvious.

    电信局答市民问（续昨）
    二、解放以来或近三个月内你们的业务盈亏情形怎样？原因何在？
    近三个月来（四月至六月）我们的盈亏情形是，四月份因为接管不久，工作的重点只在维持原状，没有进行修复和扩展工作，所以收入能够稍充裕的维持支出，并没有亏累。五月份就不然了，四月下旬小米价提高了，原价不能再维持开支，在五月十日虽然把报、话价目适当的调整，但开支也增高了；对内要在雨季前修补局舍，修复曾被特务破坏的工作，例如由琉璃河到永乐的长途干线，在五月间一个月内就被特务破坏过六次，此外并适当的进行重建工作，例如黄村收讯台两座楼房被匪军拆光，不能不拨一笔巨额款子来修建。这样五月底的收支总结，除了建设费还要靠政府投资外，还亏了一百九十五万一千三百九十四元五角七分；六月份我们不得不把报、话价目再适当的提高，六月五日报话价目每斤小米按六十元核算，但比当时市价至少还低五元。较现在（七月底）市价低到一倍多，这样六月份才算够开支了。但庞大的建设费还要靠政府投资的。举个例，大兴发讯台的兴建费我们估计现价要合人民券贰亿余元。迫于不久事实的需要，我们不能不做。现在这个大工程正在积极准备动工，象这样巨额的建筑费，我们企业虽然要自给自足，但为照顾用户负担，也只好靠政府投资，而不加在用户头上，这是很明显的事了。
