　　[Taiyuan Dispatch] After a period of fluctuation, prices in Taiyuan City have now stabilized. This price fluctuation began in early July and finally stabilized at the beginning of this month. The price increase was initially led by gauze, followed by a rush to raise prices on daily necessities such as grain and oil. The price of millet rose to 110 yuan by the 6th of this month, an increase of 90% compared to ten days prior. Analysis of the reasons for this increase primarily points to the influence of Shanghai and Tianjin. Secondly, white money was secretly at play, and private merchants and production organizations from Jin Sui, Taiyue and other places brought large sums of money to purchase goods, forming a concentration of floating capital and causing a price surge. During this price fluctuation, the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government and the Trade Company continued to implement a specialized management policy for the market, established a grain exchange to strengthen the management of grain, vigorously carried out business application registration, and stipulated that cloth merchants and trade companies not approved by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce were not allowed to sell cloth, restricting the improper operations of speculators. In terms of business operations, the retail stores' operations were suspended on the 2nd, depriving merchants who had been speculating on retail stores of the opportunity to do so. At the same time, employee consumer cooperatives and employee stores began distributing necessities for the first half of August. On the 3rd, the Trade Company changed the retail stores into distribution stores, expanding the distribution area. This ensured that grain, oil, and salt could reach consumers directly, calming their anxiety about rushing to buy goods. At the same time, the Trade Company systematically released a portion of goods according to market needs. As a result of the above series of measures, and due to the stabilization of prices in Shanghai and Tianjin, prices in Taiyuan City have recently begun to stabilize and decline. For example, on July 23rd, it took 458 jin of millet to exchange for one bolt of Jin Ding cloth, while by the 7th of this month, only 372 jin of millet were needed.

　　太原物价趋向稳落
  　贸易公司严格市场管理并改变零售店经售方式
    【太原电】太原市物价经一度波动后现已趋平稳。此次物价波动开始于七月上旬，至本月初终告平稳。此次波动首先是由纱布带头上涨，继之粮油等日用品争相涨价。小米至本月六日即涨至一百一十元，较十天前上涨了百分之九十，分析此次上涨原因主要系受沪、津影响。其次是白洋暗中作祟，及晋绥、太岳等地私商及生产机关携巨款来此采购货物，形成游资集中，造成涨风。太原市人民政府与贸易公司在此次物价波动中对市场管理继续贯彻了专行专业政策，成立了粮食交易所，加强对粮食的管理，大力进行营业申请登记工作，并规定非经工商局批准之布商贸易公司一律不卖给布匹，限制了投机商人的不正当经营。在业务经营上亦于二日停止了各零售店之业务，使一向专向零售店投机的商人无机可投。同时各职工消费合作社与职工商店，开始配售八月份上半月之必需品。三日贸易公司又把零售店改为配售店，扩大了配售面积。使粮食、油、盐能直接到达消费者手中，安定了他们争购物资的心理。同时贸易公司按着市场需要，有计划地抛出了一部分物资。由于采取了上述一连串的措施，又由于沪、津物价的转趋稳定，太原市物价近日来开始趋向平稳下落。如在上月二十三日用四百五十八斤小米，才能换一匹晋鼎布，至本月七日只需三百七十二斤小米即可。
