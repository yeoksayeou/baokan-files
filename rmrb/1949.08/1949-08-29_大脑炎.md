Encephalitis
Professor Wu Chao Ren, Peking University

In recent years, our city has seen cases of epidemic encephalitis every summer and autumn. Since August this year, patients have been emerging successively. In order to raise public awareness and vigilance, the Bureau has invited Professor Wu Chao Ren of the Department of Infectious Diseases at Peking University Medical College to write this article, which provides detailed descriptions of the types, symptoms, prevention, and treatment of this disease. We are happy to introduce it to the general public and hope that, after reading and understanding, you will provide us with as much assistance as possible in various measures concerning this matter.

Health Bureau of the People's Government of Beiping City

Encephalitis was discovered in Beiping in July. In the last two weeks, the number of infected people has increased significantly, seemingly showing a trend of epidemic. According to preliminary investigation results from the Health Bureau, Beiping hospitals treated nine patients in July, with three deaths; and fifty-eight patients in August, with fourteen deaths. Indeed, this is a serious problem. Recently, our health authorities and other relevant departments have noticed this problem and are planning methods and steps to eradicate this epidemic.

Epidemic prevention is, of course, the sole responsibility of the health authorities, but any movement must rely on everyone's cooperation to succeed. So, what attitude should we citizens take towards this encephalitis issue? I believe that on the one hand, we must attach importance to this disease and do our best to assist the authorities in eliminating it. On the other hand, we should not develop excessive fear and adopt an attitude of "talking about tigers turns one pale" or "acting in a flustered manner." We must calmly and appropriately deal with this problem. Our first task is to recognize encephalitis and understand its transmission routes and prevention methods. Therefore, I would like to give a simple introduction to encephalitis.

Classification of Encephalitis: Encephalitis can be divided into four types according to the pathogen, symptoms, and mode of transmission: 1. Encephalitis lethargica; 2. Russian spring-summer encephalitis; 3. American St. Louis encephalitis; 4. Japanese encephalitis B. Encephalitis lethargica was prevalent after the First World War thirty years ago. At that time, it was also discovered in China, but it has rarely been seen since. American St. Louis encephalitis and Japanese encephalitis B are both prevalent in late summer and early autumn, and their symptoms are very similar, but their pathogens are of different types. The encephalitis seen in Beiping now came with the Japanese invasion war. It is prevalent in late summer and early autumn, and its symptoms and mortality rate are very similar to those of Japanese encephalitis B. Therefore, we can regard the encephalitis in Beiping as the same type as Japanese encephalitis B, or say that it is Japanese encephalitis B.

Pathogen: The pathogen of encephalitis is a microorganism invisible under a microscope, smaller than ordinary bacteria, called a filterable virus. It cannot be successfully cultured using ordinary methods for culturing bacteria because filterable viruses must grow and reproduce within living cells. When the encephalitis filterable virus invades the body, it quickly reaches the central nerve cells to grow and reproduce, causing many symptoms of encephalitis.

Transmission Route: Based on the results of foreign scholars' research on American St. Louis encephalitis, we know that the natural hosts of the encephalitis virus are certain birds and rodents. Mosquitoes become infected after biting these animals, and they can transmit the pathogen to other animals or humans. Therefore, we say that mosquitoes are the vector for transmitting encephalitis. Because the virus circulation through the patient's bloodstream is temporary and not long-lasting, encephalitis patients themselves are not the primary source of infection. Now, the patients seen in Beiping are scattered throughout various districts and suburbs of the city, and there are no cases of several patients in one family. This can also indirectly prove that it is not easy for one patient to transmit the disease to others. Then we don't have to be too afraid of the sick.

Symptoms of the Disease: Although half of the patients we have seen this year are children, people of any age can get this disease. The people who get sick are not usually those who are physically weak. Strangely, most of the patients are very healthy on weekdays. The severity of the disease also varies greatly. Generally speaking, adults who get this disease are mostly very serious, and the mortality rate is relatively high. At the onset of the disease, there is general discomfort, persistent headache, muscle pain, chills, and fever. After two or three days, the temperature can rise to about 41 degrees Celsius, with nausea, vomiting, difficulty speaking, confusion, tongue and lip tremors, drowsiness, convulsions, and incontinence. Severely ill patients die within a day or two due to high fever causing heart failure. Those who are slightly less ill gradually regain consciousness after four or five days of drowsiness and high fever, and the fever gradually subsides and recovers. Those who are even less ill may have no other symptoms except for a mild fever for two or three days and a mild headache. However, regardless of the severity of the condition, the cerebrospinal fluid of encephalitis patients shows lesions, that is, increased pressure, white blood cells increased to about 100, increased protein, and normal sugar levels. Therefore, cerebrospinal fluid examination is very helpful for diagnosis.

Treatment: Unfortunately, we don't have any specific drugs now. All sulfa drugs, penicillin, etc., have no therapeutic effect on encephalitis itself. According to preliminary research reports, the newly developed antibiotics in the United States may be useful, but they are not available in Beiping, so there is no way to try them. Even so, we do not think that there is no way to deal with encephalitis. The most important thing is to seek medical treatment immediately after getting sick, especially during the epidemic season. Do not be clever and use medication casually. Encephalitis itself can be fatal, but many patients die because of severe complications caused by late treatment or improper treatment, such as dehydration, pneumonia, heart failure, and so on. If treated properly, these complications can be reduced at least, which means reducing a major factor in mortality.

Prevention: Since the main vector of encephalitis is mosquitoes, the most important thing to prevent this disease is to deal with this vector. In other words, we should do our best to do mosquito eradication work. Below, I would like to offer a few points for readers' reference:

1.  Ordinary mosquitoes breed in stagnant water and polluted water, not clean water or flowing water. Therefore, what every family in Beiping can do without spending money is to fill in the low-lying areas in your yards and outside the gate, so that no drop of sewage accumulates. Cover the water tanks in your yards and rooms tightly to prevent mosquitoes from laying eggs inside. In this way, our enemy—mosquitoes—will lose their base and perish. Isn't this method very easy? Isn't it something that every family can do?

2.  After completing the above first step, use the second method to deal with the remaining enemies, that is, use mosquito repellents, such as mosquito coils, wormwood, etc. Although these preparations cannot kill mosquitoes, burning them in the room before going to bed at night to repel the mosquitoes can always reduce our chances of being bitten by mosquitoes. There is also a symptomatic treatment, which is to install screens and hang mosquito nets, but this method can only be done by a few wealthy families.

In short, encephalitis has occurred, and it may develop to the extent of a major epidemic. Our citizens are facing this serious problem and should pay close attention to it, and calmly assist the health authorities to eliminate our current enemy. If a patient is found, send them to the hospital for treatment immediately, and at the same time, do your best to eliminate mosquitoes.

　　大脑炎
    北大教授  吴朝仁
    本市在最近几年中，每当夏秋之交，都有流行性大脑炎的发现；今年从八月以后，此病患者也陆续发生。本局为提起市民的注意和警觉，特请北大医学院传染病学教授吴朝仁大夫写出这篇文字，对此病的种类、症状、预防和治疗方法等都有详明的叙述。愿意把它介绍给广大市民，希望在阅读了解后，对此事的各种措置上，给我们尽量的协助。
    北平市人民政府卫生局
    北平市于七月间发现了大脑炎病，最近两个星期内患病的人数显著的增多，好象有流行的趋势。据卫生局初步调查结果，本市各医院诊治的病人七月九人其中三人死亡，八月五十八人十四人死亡，的确这是个严重的问题。最近我们的卫生当局及其他有关部门已注意到这问题，而且正在计划扑灭这种疫疠的方法与步骤。
    防疫事情，固然是卫生当局的专责，但是任何运动，要成功必须靠大家的合作。那末，我们市民对于这次大脑炎的问题应该取什么态度呢？我认为我们一方面要重视这个病，尽最大力量来协助当局消灭它；另一方面也不应当发生过分的恐怖心理而呈现“谈虎色变”“举止失措”的态度，我们对这问题要沉着应付适当处理。我们首先的工作是认识大脑炎这个病，并且了解它传染的途径与预防的方法，因此我愿意把大脑炎作个简单的介绍。
    大脑炎分类：大脑炎按病原、症状及流行的方式可分作四个类型，就是：一、昏睡性脑炎，二、俄国春夏脑炎，三、美国圣路易脑炎，四、日本乙种脑炎。昏睡性脑炎于三十年前第一次世界大战后曾流行过，那时中国也曾有发现，但后来就很少见了。美国圣路易脑炎和日本乙种脑炎都是流行在夏末秋初，症状也很相似，但是它们的病原是不同型的。现在北平所见的大脑炎是跟着日本侵略战争而来的，是流行于夏末秋初而且它的症候及死亡率也是和日本乙种病很相同，因此我们可以视北平的大脑炎与日本乙种脑炎同型或者说就是日本乙种脑炎。
    病原：大脑炎的病原是一种显微镜看不见，比普通细菌更小的微生物，叫做滤过性毒。用普通培养细菌的方法来培养是它不能成功的，因为滤过性毒必须在活的细胞内才能生长繁殖。当大脑炎滤过性毒侵入身体后，就很快的到中枢神经细胞里生长繁殖，引起大脑炎的许多症状。
    传染途径：根据外国学者对于美国圣路易脑炎研究的结果，我们知道脑炎病毒的天然宿主是某些禽类及啮齿动物，蚊子咬了这些动物后就受染了，它们就能将病原传给其他动物或人类。因此我们就说蚊子是传染大脑炎的媒介，因为病毒经过病人血液循环是暂时的，不是长久的，所以大脑炎病人本身不是传染的主要来源。现在北平所见的病人也都是散布于市内各区及郊区，而且没有一家有几个患者的情形，这也可以间接的证明由一个病人传给别人是很不容易的。那末我们对于病者就不必太恐惧了。
    病的症状：虽然今年我们所见的病人有一半是儿童，但是任何年龄都可以得这个病。得病的人不是平素体弱的人，很奇怪的，多数的患者平日是很健康的。病的轻重也大有差别，一般讲起来大人得这种病多半很严重，死亡率也比较高。病初起时全身不适，持续性头痛、肌肉痛、发冷、发烧，二三日后热度可增高至摄氏四十一度左右，恶心、呕吐、说话困难、神志不清、舌唇颤震、昏睡、搐搦及大小便失禁。重病者在一两天内因发高热引起心脏衰竭而死；稍轻者经过四五天的昏睡高热后渐渐清醒，热渐退而愈；再轻者除轻度发烧二、三天及轻度头痛外，可无其他症状。但是无论病情轻重，大脑炎患者的脑脊液都呈现病变，即压力增高，白血球增到一百左右，蛋白质增加而糖量正常，因此脑脊液检查对于诊断是很有帮助的。
    治疗：很不幸，我们现在还没有什么特效药，所有的磺胺剂、盘尼西林等对于大脑炎本身都没有治疗的效果。最近美国新制的抗生剂，据初步研究的报告，可能有用，但是北平还买不到，所以也无法试用。虽然如此，我们并不认为对于大脑炎是毫无办法的，最要紧的是一得病立刻请大夫诊治，尤其是在本病流行的季节里，不应自作聪明，随便用药。大脑炎本身固然可以致死，但是也有不少病人是因为治疗太晚或治疗不得法得了严重的并发症，如脱水症、肺炎、心脏衰竭等等而死亡的。假如治疗得适当，最少可以减少这几种并发症，那就是说，减少了死亡的一部主要因素。
    预防：大脑炎的主要传染媒介既然是蚊子，那末要预防这个病当然最要紧的是对付这个媒介。换句话说，我们应当尽最大力量来作灭蚊工作，下面我愿意提出几点给读者参考：
    一、普通蚊子繁殖的地方是静水、秽水而不是清水、不是流水，因此北平每一家都可以不花钱做到的是把您们院子里、大门外的洼地填平，不让有一滴污水积留，把您们院子里屋子里的水缸盖严，不让蚊子在里边孵卵，这样我们的敌人——蚊子，就失去了根据地而至于灭亡。这个办法不是很容易吗？不是每家都可办到的吗？
    二、完成上述第一步工作后用第二个办法来对付残余敌人，那就是利用驱蚊剂，如蚊香，蒿子草等，这种制剂虽然不能杀蚊，但是在晚间临睡前把它燃起来，熏去屋内蚊子，总可以让我们减少被蚊咬的机会。还有一个治标的方法，就是安纱窗，挂蚊帐，但是这个办法只有少数有能力的人家能作到。
    总之大脑炎已发生了，它可能发展到大流行的程度，我们市民面临着这个严重的问题是应当十分注意的，并当沉着的协助卫生当局来扑灭我们当前的敌人，一发现病人立即送医院治疗，同时要尽最大力量来消灭蚊子。
