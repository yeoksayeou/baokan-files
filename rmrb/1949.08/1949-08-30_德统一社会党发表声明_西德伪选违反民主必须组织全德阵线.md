Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 29th: TASS Berlin, August 26th dispatch: The recent plenary meeting of the Executive Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, held here, passed a special resolution on the "election" of the separate West German state "parliament," stating that the results of this "election" cannot be considered a manifestation of the free and democratic will of the German people under any circumstances. This is the result of using anti-communist slander to deal with the true representatives of the German people, and using political and economic pressure and personal terror against them. In the election campaign, the Communist Party became the object of terror. Communist Party newspapers were already in a far more disadvantageous position than bourgeois newspapers, and were often banned during the election struggle. Communist Party election documents were confiscated. The anti-democratic nature of the so-called "Bonn Basic Law" has been fully exposed in the election struggle.

　　Financial capital remains the sole owner of radio and all other tools that influence the masses. They united all these tools to wantonly slander the Communist Party. German Communist leader Lehmann was imprisoned while the election struggle was underway. Communist Party activists were subjected to barbaric terror and even murder. After pointing out the anti-democratic nature of the electoral system, the resolution further emphasized that the results of the West German election could have extremely fatal political consequences. It will strengthen the policy of dividing Germany and make the struggle to restore national unity more difficult. The double oppression and exploitation of the working people of West Germany will be further intensified.

　　The resolution emphasized that to avoid the fatal consequences of this election, the only way is for the forces of all the German people to unite and form a broad and powerful all-German front to fight for German unity.

　　德统一社会党发表声明
  　西德伪选违反民主必须组织全德阵线
    【新华社北平二十九日电】据塔斯社柏林二十六日讯：最近在此间举行的德国统一社会党执行委员会全体会议就分立的西德国家“国会”的“选举”通过特别决议称：这次“选举”的结果无论如何不能认为是德国人民自由民主意志的表现。这是以反共污蔑的手段对付真正的德国人民代表，对他们使用政治及经济压力及人身恐怖等的结果。在竞选运动中，共产党成为恐怖的对象。共产党报刊本已处于远比资产阶级的报刊为不利的地位，而在选举斗争进行时更常常被禁。共产党的选举文件被没收。所谓“波恩根本法”的反民主本质已在选举斗争中暴露无遗。
    金融资本仍然是无线电及其他一切影响群众的工具的惟一拥有者。他们将所有这些工具联合起来肆意地污蔑共产党。德共领袖雷曼在选举斗争正在进行时被关到牢狱里。德共活动分子遭到野蛮的恐怖以至谋杀。决议指出选举制度的反民主性质后，进一步强调西德选举的结果可以产生极致命的政治后果。它将加强德国的分裂政策，并使恢复国家统一的斗争更为困难。对西德劳动人民双重的压迫和榨取将更为加甚。
    决议着重指出，要避免这次选举的致命后果，只有全德国人民的力量联合起来，组成争取德国统一的广泛和强大的全德阵线。
