[This City News] Following the closing of the municipal All-Circles Representatives Conference, the Municipal Education Bureau, based on the cultural and educational proposals passed by the conference, has reviewed its past work and formulated preliminary work plans for the present. Regarding the enrollment of workers' children, a second plan for increasing classes and schools in municipal primary schools is underway. Based on current conditions, it is estimated that approximately 1,000 students can be accommodated. In secondary schools, according to incomplete statistics, during the July enrollment of municipal secondary schools (including the Municipal Ninth Middle School in Mentougou), a total of 402 workers' children were admitted. To further enroll workers' children with secondary school qualifications, the Municipal Education Bureau plans to add 14 worker children's classes in municipal middle schools, accommodating approximately 700 to 900 students. New Life, Da Zhong, and other private schools under the administration of the Education Bureau can also receive government subsidies for certain public expenses to add several classes. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is now undertaking the statistical work on workers' children's enrollment to facilitate planned and organized admissions. In addition, the Education Bureau plans to launch a large-scale campaign for public and private secondary schools, as well as various agencies, organizations, factories, and schools in the city, to establish formal or informal remedial classes, adult classes, and literacy night schools. In terms of social education, the Education Bureau is determined to strengthen adult continuing education and mobilize schools and agencies to establish adult remedial classes. It will also continue to run children's literacy classes, with curricula, teaching materials, and teaching plans identical to those of general primary schools, allowing students to transfer to regular primary schools. In urban areas, it is planned to first add four people's education centers and four newspaper and reading rooms. Due to limited conditions, social education work in suburban areas has not been well improved since liberation. In addition to strengthening the leadership of the people's education centers in Changxindian, Mentougou, Nanyuan, Gaobeidian, and other districts, it has also been decided to strengthen the work of mobile film teams, planning to establish a formal suburban film team. To strengthen the leadership of social education work, the Education Bureau is preparing to establish a unified leadership organization for social education work jointly with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's Federation, the Youth Federation, and other relevant agencies and organizations.
