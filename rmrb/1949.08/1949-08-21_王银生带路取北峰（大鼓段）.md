The People's Liberation Army captured Huayin County,
　　The bandit troops who escaped fled to Mount Hua.
　　Mount Hua's terrain is truly dangerous,
　　The mountain peaks pierce into the clouds.
　　The cliffs on all sides are hundreds of feet high,
　　Even mountain monkeys find it hard to climb.
　　There is only one winding path to the top,
　　Heavily guarded by the bandit troops.
　　Han Zipei, the bandit brigade commander,
　　Patted his chest on the mountaintop and bragged loudly,
　　"Let's see how much skill your People's Liberation Army has?
　　I guarantee you can't fly up the mountain even with wings."
　　We won't talk about the bandits on the mountain for now,
　　Let's turn back and talk about the brave soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who are exploring the mountain.
　　Liu Jiyao, the reconnaissance staff officer, took the lead,
　　Leading six scouts.
　　Each scout was clever and capable,
　　All were strong young men in their twenties.
　　They had been out for three whole days,
　　Climbing over countless large and small mountains;
　　Walking through many villages and asking many questions,
　　But still, they couldn't find any trace of a path.
　　One day, they were sitting at the foot of the mountain again,
　　Discussing ideas.
　　Suddenly, everyone looked up to the south,
　　And saw a person running happily in a hurry.
　　The scouts were very surprised,
　　"What is this person doing here?"
　　They quietly prepared themselves,
　　Guarding against any unexpected events.
　　In the midst of speaking, that person arrived quickly,
　　It turned out to be a woodcutter approaching.
　　This woodcutter was running with a flushed face and panting breath,
　　Carefully looking up and down,
　　"Are you comrades from the People's Liberation Army?
　　What brings you to the deep mountains?"
　　Staff Officer Liu replied, "Yes, yes, yes!
　　We're here to fight the Chiang bandits on that mountain.
　　We've walked so many roads these past few days,
　　And asked all the local villagers.
　　We can't find the path up the mountain,
　　And we're having a hard time here."
　　The woodcutter nodded after hearing this,
　　Opened his eyes wide and looked up and down,
　　Causing the scouts to stare in amazement,
　　The woodcutter smiled and stepped forward,
　　Grasping Staff Officer Liu's hand tightly,
　　"Comrades, comrades,
　　Please come to my house and we'll talk slowly."
　　The woodcutter led the way,
　　The seven brave soldiers followed behind.
　　Staff Officer Liu spoke as they walked:
　　"Listen respectfully, old fellow,
　　What is your name and how many brothers do you have?
　　Which village is your home in?
　　How does your family make a living?"
　　The woodcutter slowly opened his mouth:
　　"Listen to me, comrades,
　　Speaking of my home, it's not far away,
　　I live in the village of Liangchakou.
　　Wang Yinsheng is my name,
　　My ancestors have been chopping wood on Mount Hua.
　t mention my parents,
　　Mentioning my old father makes my heart ache;
　　Four years ago, one day,
　　My old father went to Huayin County to sell firewood,
　　The old man was selling firewood on the street,
　　When a group of bandits rushed up,
　　Without saying a word, they snatched the firewood,
　　They grabbed an entire load of firewood.
　　Grabbing the firewood wasn't enough,
　　They knocked him to the ground.
　　My old father returned home, both angry and anxious, and fell ill,
　　He didn't eat or drink and passed away.
　　I know the way to Mount Hua,
　　I am willing to lead the way to seek justice."
　　They spoke and walked quickly,
　　Arriving at Yinsheng's home,
　　Old Mrs. Wang learned of this matter,
　　Her face lit up with joy,
　　She borrowed a large rope, ten zhang long, from her neighbor,
　　"Listen carefully, my son,
　　Securely tie the rope to the 'Tianjing' (heavenly well),
　　Carefully remember the paths on the mountain."
　　At noon, after eating,
　　Yinsheng led the way up the mountain.
　　The mountain was high and the slopes were steep, the road narrow and winding,
　　Strange rocks and cliffs curved to the left and right.
　　Wild grass grew everywhere, and people were scarce,
　　Layers of fallen leaves covered the ground, and birds chirped.
　　Mountain springs gurgled, flowing clear water,
　　Pine and cypress trees formed forests, covering the blue sky.
　　Scout Lao Wang had a fiery temper,
　　And his eyes widened in anger when he encountered this road.
　　He became impatient as they walked slowly,
　　And took large strides forward.
　　He felt his foot slip,
　　His body swayed and he was about to fall.
　　He hurriedly grabbed a branch,
　　But who knew the tree was dead and the branch was dry,
　　There was a cracking sound,
　　Lao Wang fell
　　Head over heels.
　　Everyone laughed
　　"Yo! Lao Wang,
　　Your butt must be
　　Broken in two."
　　Lao Wang was both angry
　　And laughing as he
　　Quickly stood
　　Up,
　　Without raising his head, he walked
　　Forward.
　　The brave soldiers crossed mountains
　　And rivers, arriving
　　Quickly,
　　There was a cliff
　　Hundreds of feet high
　　Standing before them.
　　Looking ahead, the road
　　Was cut off,
　　Wang Yinsheng spoke
　　From the side,
　　"Everyone look at
　　That black hole above
　　The cliff,
　　From below, it looks like a 'Tianjing' (heavenly well).
　　We need to climb up along the 'Tianjing',
　　There is a small path above that leads to the mountain peak."
　　Everyone nodded after hearing this,
　　Good Yinsheng tied the large rope he brought around his waist.
　　He opened his legs and used his hands,
　　Pressing his feet against both sides, climbing happily.
　　Wang Yinsheng climbing the "Tianjing" can be compared to:
　　A monkey stealing peaches climbing to the top of a tree.
　　Before long, he disappeared from sight,
　　A rope end fell to the bottom.
　　Staff Officer Liu grabbed the rope and climbed up,
　　His feet left the ground and he hung upside down.
　　The seven people were hoisted up one by one,
　　The mountain path above was even harder to walk.
　　Everyone worked together,
　　Slowly climbing and slowly scaling.
　　After climbing over one mountain, there was another ridge,
　　After crossing a ditch, there was another bend;
　　Ditches connected to ditches, never ending,
　　Mountains relied on mountains, ten thousand mountains.
　　Stones on the road bumped their feet,
　　Thorns on the side of the road tore their clothes.
　　After struggling to climb over a ridge,
　　There was another stone wall blocking the path.
　　Although it didn't look very dangerous,
　　How could they get to the top without anything to hold on to?
　　Wang Yinsheng spoke without delay,
　　Saying that climbing up wasn't difficult.
　　For more than twenty years, he's been chopping wood and gathering herbs,
　　Spending months and years in the mountains.
　　Wang Yinsheng finished speaking and started climbing,
　　Reaching the top by stepping on the cracks in the rocks.
　　He tied the rope to a tree stump,
　　And the comrades pulled themselves up the mountain.
　　Walking north on the mountain for another li,
　　There was a deep ravine that reached from the ground to the sky.
　　The overhanging eaves above the ravine made the mountain imposing,
　　The bottom of the ravine was a bottomless abyss.
　　There was a path along the slope,
　　That path was not even half a foot wide.
　　The comrades were careful and didn't dare to breathe,
　　Hugging the mountain with trepidation.
　　Wang Yinsheng encouraged everyone,
　　And finally, they passed this difficult hurdle.
　　The comrades gritted their teeth and pushed harder,
　　Watching the sun set,
　　Taking advantage of the darkness, they hurried on,
　　Reaching the edge of North Peak in one breath.
　　Some of the comrades' shoes had worn through,
　　Some of their clothes were torn in half;
　　Some of their legs and feet were scraped,
　　Some of their skin was bleeding red;
　　They wrapped their scraped hands and feet with cloth,
　　And bandaged their bleeding skin.
　　Crossing the enemy's four lines of defense,
　　Everyone was truly happy in their hearts.
　　Wang Yinsheng quietly called Staff Officer Liu,
　　And pointed straight ahead with his right hand.
　　"There is an Ancestral Master Temple over there,
　　The bandit troops on North Peak are living inside."
　　Staff Officer Liu nodded after hearing this,
　　And secretly made a plan.
　　They surrounded the temple from all sides,
　　And everyone agreed to charge forward.
　　Staff Officer Liu rushed to the front with his gun,
　　The temple door was tightly closed.
　　He gritted his teeth and used all his strength,
　　Kicking the temple door forward;
　　There was a cracking sound,
　　The two temple doors were kicked down.
　　A burst of fire erupted,
　　The sound of submachine guns shook the mountain.
　　"Lay down your weapons and we won't kill you, quickly come over to our side,"
　　The earth-shaking slogans shouted loudly.
　　Guns fired and people shouted,
　　The bandit troops were thrown into chaos in their dreams.
　　One couldn't find his pants,
　　Another grabbed a small jacket and wore it as shoes.
　　Zhang San was so scared that he was shivering all over;
　　Li Si, butt naked, crawled under the offering table.
　　The bandit squad leader told everyone to run quickly,
　t distinguishing between northeast and southwest.
　　The bandit soldiers were all terrified,
　　They couldn't even find the safety catch on their guns.
　　Staff Officer Liu charged into the room,
　　And shouted, "Listen to me, bandit troops,
　　Lay down your weapons and we won't kill you, it's a lenient policy,
　　Quickly surrender and don't delay."
　　More than twenty bandit troops surrendered,
　　And the People's Liberation Army controlled North Peak.
　　The bandit Han was dumbfounded on West Peak,
　　The more he thought about it, the more confused he became.
　　Mount Hua has cliffs thousands of feet high on all sides,
　　And the only path was heavily guarded;
　　It was difficult to fly up the mountain even with wings,
　　So how did the People's Liberation Army get up the mountain?
　　Now that the People's Liberation Army has occupied North Peak,
　　They have the high ground and have seized the initiative in the war.
　　Seeing that my West Peak has become a dead end,
　　It's difficult to defend it.
　　Bandit Han had no choice,
　　And led his underlings down the mountain.
　　Raising a white flag in surrender,
　　The story of the People's Liberation Army's miraculous capture of North Peak is being told.

　　王银生带路取北峰（大鼓段）
    苗培时　曹子戈
     解放军打下了华阴县，
     漏网的匪军跑上华山。
     这华山的地势真险要，
     山头高插入云端。
     四面的山崖千百丈，
     山猴子来爬也难上难。
     通山上只有那弯弯曲曲一条小路，
     被匪军封锁的严上加严。
     匪军旅长韩子佩，
     在山顶拍着胸脯吹大言，
     看看你解放军的本领有多大？
     保险你插上双翅也飞不上山。
     山上匪军暂不表，
     回过头咱单说解放军的勇士们来探山。
     刘吉尧侦察参谋把头带，
     率领着六个侦察员。
     侦察员一个个精明又强干，
     都是那二十多岁的青壮年。
     他们出来了三天整，
     爬过了大山小山不知多少山；
     走了多少村庄问了多少个遍，
     连个路影也不着边。
     那一天又坐在山脚下，
     大家想法把话谈。
     忽然间大家抬头往南看，
     有个人急急忙忙跑的欢。
     侦察员一看很奇怪，
     这人到此为哪般？
     悄悄地低声作准备，
     防备着临时出事端。
     说话间那人来的快，
     原来是一个樵夫到跟前。
     这樵夫跑的脸红气发喘，
     仔仔细细上下看，
     “诸位是不是解放军？
     有什么事儿到深山？”
     刘参谋回答“是是是！
     为打那山上的蒋匪到这边。
     几天来不知走了多少路，
     当地的老乡也问完。
     上山的路子找不见，
     我们这里正作难。”
     樵夫听罢把头点，
     睁大了两眼上下翻，
     将侦察员看的发了楞，
     樵夫含笑走上前，
     紧紧拉住刘参谋的手，
     “同志们，同志们，
     请到我家里咱们慢慢的谈。”
     樵夫头前把路带，
     七位勇士随后边。
     刘参谋一边走着开言道：
     尊声“老乡你听言，
     你姓字名谁弟兄几个，
     哪个村庄把家按？
     家里生活靠哪般？”
     樵夫慢慢开了口：
     “诸位同志听我谈，
     提起家来家不远，
     住在那两岔口村子里边。
     王银生就是我的名和姓，
     祖辈打柴在华山。
     不提双亲还罢了，
     提起了老爹爹好心酸；
     四年以前有一天，
     老爹爹卖柴进华阴县，
     老人家正在街上把柴卖，
     一群胡匪闯到跟前，
     二话不说把柴抢，
     一挑子柴火抢了个干。
     抢走柴火还不算，
     又把他打倒在地平川。
     老爹爹回家又急又气就得了病，
     茶饭不吃归西天。
     要上华山我知道路，
     我情愿带路为伸冤。”
     边说边走来的快，
     来到银生他家园，
     王老太太知道了这件事，
     眉开眼笑心喜欢，
     从邻家借来一条大绳长十丈，
     “叫声我儿细听言，
     上‘天井’绳子要牢牢拴，
     山上的道路你要仔细记心间。”
     天到中午吃过饭，
     银生头前带路上了山。
     山高坡陡羊肠路，
     怪石悬崖左右弯。
     荒草漫漫人绝迹，
     落叶层层鸟声喧。
     山泉奔放哗喇喇地流清水，
     松伯成林盖住了青天。
     侦察员老王性情燥，
     遇见这路眼睛气圆。
     慢慢走来他不耐，
     迈开大步往前窜。
     觉着脚下一松劲，
     身子一歪人要翻。
     他急忙抓住树枝子，
     谁知道树死枝子干，
     只听咯巴一声响，
     老王摔了个
     脚朝天。
     众人一看哈
     哈笑，
     “呦！老王
     屁股一定
     摔成两半边。”
     那老王又气
     又笑忙站
     起，
     头也没抬走
     向前。
     众勇士翻山
     过水来得
     快，
     有一座数百
     丈的绝崖
     立在面前。
     看看前面绝
     了路，
     王银生一旁
     开了言，
     “大家看山
     崖上面那
     个黑洞，
     从下边看去‘天井’一般。
     咱们要顺着‘天井’爬上去，
     那上面有条小路通山巅。”
     众人听罢把头点，
     好银生把带来的大绳套在腰间。
     只见他两腿义开双手用劲，
     两脚撑着两边爬的欢。
     王银生上“天井”好有一比：
     好比那猴子偷桃上树尖。
     不大一会人不见，
     一根绳头落下边。
     刘参谋抓住绳头往上攀，
     两脚离地人倒悬。
     七个人一个一个吊上去，
     上面的山路行更难。
     众人一心齐加劲，
     慢慢爬来慢慢攀。
     爬过一个山来又是一个岭，
     过了一道沟来又是一个湾；
     沟连着沟来沟不断，
     山靠着山来山万千。
     路上的石头把脚碰，
     路旁的荆棘扯衣衫。
     千辛万苦爬过一个岭，
     又有个石壁把路拦。
     看着虽然不很险，
     没捉没拿怎到上边？
     王银生开言不待慢，
     要说爬上也不难。
     打柴采药二十多载，
     成年论月在山里钻。
     王银生说罢住上爬，
     登着石缝到了上边。
     把绳子拴在树桩上，
     同志们扯着绳子上了山。
     上山向北又走了一里路，
     一道深沟入地顶天。
     沟上面飞檐突出山势壮，
     沟下面看不到底的万丈深渊。
     靠斜坡有着一条路，
     那道路没有半尺宽。
     同志们小心谨慎不敢喘气，
     提心吊胆身靠着山。
     王银生把大家来鼓励，
     总算又过了这难关。
     众同志咬牙再加劲，
     眼看着太阳落下山，
     趁着天黑急赶路，
     一口气摸到了北峰边。
     同志们有的鞋子磨透底，
     有的衣衫扯半边；
     有的腿脚都擦破，
     有的皮肉冒血红鲜鲜；
     手脚擦破用布裹，
     皮肉出血绑带缠。
     越过那敌人四道封锁线，
     众人一个一个心里高兴真喜欢。
     王银生低声把刘参谋叫，
     右手一摇指正前。
     “那边有座祖师庙，
     北峰的匪军住里边。”
     刘参谋听罢把头点，
     心里暗暗打算盘。
     四方八面围庙院，
     大家同意杀向前。
     刘参谋提枪奔正面，
     那庙门关的严又严。
     他咬牙用尽生平力，
     脚踢庙门冲向前；
     只听咔嚓一声响，
     两扇庙门被踢翻。
     哗啦一声开了火，
     冲锋枪声响撼山。
     “缴枪不杀快反正”，
     震天的口号喊的欢。
     枪又响来人也喊，
     梦里的匪军乱了营盘。
     这一个裤子找不见，
     哪一个拿着小褂当鞋穿。
     有张三吓的浑身打冷战；
     那李四光着屁股就往供桌底下钻。
     匪班长叫大家赶快跑，
     不辨东北与西南。
     匪兵们一个一个破了胆，
     枪在手里摸不着拴。
     刘参谋杀到屋子里，
     叫道“匪军听我言，
     缴枪不杀宽大政策，
     快快投诚莫迟延。”
     二十多个匪军缴了械，
     解放军控制了北峰岭。
     那韩匪在西峰傻了眼，
     越思越想摸不着边。
     这华山四面绝崖高千丈，
     一条小路封锁严；
     插翅也难飞上这山岭，
     解放军到底怎样上的山？
     到如今解放军占了北峰地，
     居高临下夺取了战争主动权。
     眼看着我这西峰成死地，
     要想守住难上难。
     韩匪万般无可奈，
     带领着喽罗下了山。
     扯起白旗当俘虏，
     解放军奇取北峰故事传。
