Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 16th: TASS, Moscow, August 11th: The Soviet government's reply to the Yugoslav government.

As previously reported, on July 19th, the Soviet government sent a note to the Yugoslav government in response to Yugoslavia's note regarding the Soviet attitude towards Yugoslavia's demands on Austria in the discussion of the draft Austrian peace treaty. On August 3rd, the Yugoslav government sent another note to the Soviet government. On August 11th, the Soviet government replied to Yugoslavia, with the following content:

"The Soviet government, having considered the Yugoslav note of August 3rd of this year, deems it necessary to make the following statement:

The Soviet government will refrain from mentioning the discourteous tone of the Yugoslav government's August 3rd note, nor the slanders and fabrications against Soviet foreign policy that the Yugoslav government has picked up from the fascist arsenal. The Soviet government did not expect anything else from the current Yugoslav government, because having already defected from the socialist and democratic camp and thrown itself into the camp of foreign capital and reactionaries, it is not surprising that the Yugoslav government violates the basic rules of etiquette in exchanges between the two governments and repeatedly reiterates the anti-Soviet defamatory accusations of the fascists.

Let us look at the facts.

The Soviet Union supported Yugoslavia's demands on Austria.

The Tito clique betrayed national interests, broke faith and changed its plans repeatedly.

(1) After the Second World War, the Yugoslav government made its economic and territorial demands on Austria, requesting that the Slovene border region of Carinthia and Styria (total area of 2,600 square kilometers, population of approximately 190,000) be given to Yugoslavia. The Soviet government undertook the obligation to support these demands and supported them at the Foreign Ministers' Conference in opposition to the United States, Britain, and France.

In April 1947, Mr. Kardelj, Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, sent a special letter to Vyshinsky on behalf of the Yugoslav government, in which he put forward the Yugoslav government's new attitude regarding Yugoslavia's demands on Austria. The essence of this new attitude, as seen in Mr. Kardelj's letter, was that the Yugoslav government did not intend to obtain satisfaction of Yugoslavia's demands from the Western countries, and therefore suggested abandoning Slovene Carinthia and limiting its demands only to a small piece of territory near two power stations on the Drava River. Kardelj wrote: "The problem can be solved by slightly modifying the border. For this purpose, I present to you two draft plans, which can ultimately be resolved by establishing special rights for the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in the management of these power stations."

The first plan was to transfer Austrian territory with an area of 210 square kilometers and a population of 9,396 to Yugoslavia. The second plan was limited to transferring Austrian territory with an area of 63 square kilometers and a population of 3,150 to Yugoslavia. However, there was a third plan. This plan was expressed in Kardelj's letter in the manner already mentioned above: "The problem can be solved by slightly modifying the border. For this purpose, I present to you two draft plans, which can ultimately be resolved by establishing special rights for the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in the management of these power stations." In other words, Yugoslavia abandoned all its territorial demands on Austria and limited its demands only to Yugoslavia obtaining special rights in the management of two power stations in other people's territory.

It is thus clear that in April 1947, the Yugoslav government already considered it necessary not only to abandon Slovene Carinthia, not only to abandon the small piece of territory that constitutes a part of Slovene Carinthia, but also to abandon all territorial demands on Austria.

This was at the time when the Soviet government was defending Yugoslavia's demands on Slovene Carinthia at meetings with representatives of Western countries.

This is an undeniable fact.

The Yugoslav government, in its note of August 3rd, specifically pointed out that abandoning Slovene Carinthia was an act of treachery, a betrayal of the interests of the Slovene residents of Carinthia, a violation of the right to national self-determination, a manifestation of imperialist policy, and a squandering of Slovene Carinthia as small change, etc. If there is indeed any treachery and betrayal of Yugoslav interests, then, as can be seen in Kardelj's letter, the Yugoslav government, and only the Yugoslav government, should be considered the betrayer.

The Tito clique's despicable conspiracy:

Using the abandonment of territorial demands to slander the Soviet Union and deceive the people.

(2) When the Yugoslav government made these concessions and abandoned its territorial demands, it seemed that it should be responsible for this attitude. But the Yugoslav government had other plans. It believed that the Soviet government should announce these concessions itself and initiate and bear full responsibility for this matter. As for the Yugoslav government, it should stay out of it and not bear any responsibility for the fact that the Yugoslav government deemed it necessary to abandon Slovene Carinthia in April 1947. When Soviet Ambassador Lavrentiev asked Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito (Kardelj was also present at the time) whether the Yugoslav government wanted to formally announce its new attitude when he was received in August 1947, Tito replied (as recorded by the Soviet Ambassador): If the Yugoslav government is asked to issue a formal statement on abandoning its demands on Slovene Carinthia, the Yugoslav government cannot make such a statement. Yugoslavia would rather abandon its minimum demands than issue such a statement.

It is thus clear that according to the Yugoslav government's plan, the Soviet government should bear responsibility for abandoning Slovene Carinthia, and generally for abandoning all of Yugoslavia's territorial demands, while the Yugoslav government should stay out of it, so as to create a false impression in the minds of the Yugoslav people that the Yugoslav government supposedly continues to maintain its original position of demanding that Slovene Carinthia be incorporated into Yugoslavia. Therefore, the initiative to abandon Slovene Carinthia did not come from the Yugoslav government, but from the Soviet government. In short, it was suggested that the Soviet Union act as a tool to deceive the Yugoslav people—a deception created by the Yugoslav government. The Yugoslav government naively thought that the Soviet government would succumb to this political trickery.

It is understandable that the Soviet government could not succumb to this despicable conspiracy. The Soviet government declared that if the Yugoslav government faithfully, formally, and fully responsibly put forward these demands, it (the Soviet government—translator) would be prepared to defend Yugoslavia's demands, but the Soviet Union could not defend demands that the Yugoslav government had actually abandoned.

In view of these facts, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers it necessary to refute the assertion in the Yugoslav government's note of August 3rd that Soviet government representatives had at any time suggested that Yugoslavia should lower its territorial demands. The falsity of this assertion can be seen from the fact that as early as November 1947, the Soviet Ambassador to Yugoslavia, in response to an inquiry from the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs, informed the latter that the Soviet Union saw no basis for Yugoslavia to lower its territorial demands on Austria. Moreover, in 1948, when Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simić informed the Soviet Ambassador that Soviet Ambassador to London, Zarubin, had allegedly advised Yugoslav representative Bebler at the Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference on the Austrian peace treaty to propose a suggestion regarding Yugoslavia's territorial demands that was fundamentally different from its original demands, namely to lower Yugoslavia's demands, Soviet Ambassador Lavrentiev replied: "Bebler suggested to Koktomov, the Soviet representative authorized to negotiate the Austrian peace treaty in London in the spring, that a proposal be put forward at the Four-Power Conference that contained a reduction of Yugoslavia's territorial demands on Austria. Bebler also made the same suggestion in a conversation with the Soviet Ambassador to London, Zarubin. Bebler's suggestions were rejected by both Koktomov and Soviet Ambassador Zarubin. It was pointed out to Bebler at the time that the Soviet delegation would support suggestions formally proposed by the Yugoslav representative himself."

Tito secretly talked with Britain behind the Soviet Union's back, sacrificing the interests of the Slovene people.

(3) At the same time, as was later discovered, the Yugoslav government also held secret talks with British representatives in Belgrade and London behind the Soviet government's back, negotiating with them to abandon Slovene Carinthia, while keeping it secret from the Soviet Union. Although the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia had a treaty of alliance, the Soviet government never knew what these gentlemen had agreed upon. The Yugoslav government insists that nothing was hidden from the Soviet Union in these talks—here referring to Mr. Kardelj's letter to Vyshinsky. But Kardelj's letter does not mention at all that the Yugoslav government wanted to negotiate with British representatives on the above basis. There was no hint of this in the repeated talks between the Yugoslav representatives and the Soviet representatives. Moreover, the aforementioned behind-the-scenes negotiations with British representatives had already been completed, but the Yugoslav government continued to keep the results of these negotiations secret from the Soviet government, not considering it necessary to inform the Soviet government. Two years have passed since then, but even today, the Soviet government does not know what the results of these behind-the-scenes negotiations were and who they were aimed against, because even what the Yugoslav government was forced to tell the Soviet Ambassador after being pressed by the latter was not even a tenth of the actual negotiations. One thing is not in doubt, namely, that in these behind-the-scenes negotiations, secret agreements were reached that sacrificed the interests of the Slovene people of Carinthia—agreements that damaged Yugoslavia's national rights.

(4) The Yugoslav note falsely and slanderously states that the Soviet government did not want to refute the news in the Austrian newspapers that "Stalin had promised the President of the Austrian Republic, Renner, to guarantee Austria's 1938 borders." The Yugoslav government knows that this news in the Austrian newspapers is false and fabricated. The Yugoslav government, having been notified by its ambassador to Moscow, Popović, about the content of the so-called letter (referring to Stalin's letter to Renner—translator), also knew that this letter did not mention "guaranteeing Austria's borders" at all, so there was no need to refute this rumor in the Austrian newspapers. Now, the Yugoslav government puts forward the ridiculous claim that this news has never been denied by the Soviet news agency. As an aside, the Yugoslav government itself—as it knew—had at that time spoken out against any denial.

It is thus clear that the Yugoslav government, eager to slander the Soviet Union, was forced to refute itself.

The South government relies on imperialism, and the Soviet Union no longer supports Tito's demands.

(5) All these circumstances lead the Soviet government to the conclusion that the Yugoslav government has violated its obligations of alliance to the Soviet Union; its behavior is not that of an ally of the Soviet Union but that of an opponent; some powerful ties bind the Yugoslav government, or the main figures in that government, closely to the camp of foreign capitalists; the Yugoslav government is becoming increasingly dependent on the imperialist bloc to oppose the Soviet Union, and is colluding with the imperialist bloc; the Soviet government can no longer regard the Yugoslav government as an ally of the Soviet Union; the Soviet government can no longer support the demands of the Yugoslav government, especially those demands that the Yugoslav government itself has abandoned, even though it keeps this abandonment secret from the Yugoslav people; if the Yugoslav government prefers to form a united front with the imperialist bloc rather than a united front with the Soviet Union, then let the imperialist bloc support its demands.

Speaking of a meeting at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Soviet government understands that the Yugoslav government is playing its two-faced game on the issue of Slovene Carinthia. On the one hand, it is formally insisting on transferring Slovene Carinthia to the Yugoslav Republic; on the other hand, the Yugoslav government has actually secretly negotiated with Western countries behind the Soviet Union's back to abandon this attitude and abandon Slovene Carinthia. The Soviet government naturally does not want to have anything in common with this policy of deceiving the Yugoslav people pursued by the Yugoslav government, and naturally should not support the position that the Yugoslav government had in fact abandoned as early as April 1947 when Kardelj wrote to Vyshinsky.

(6) The Yugoslav government, in its note, expresses indignation at the fact that the Soviet Foreign Minister refused to receive the representative of the Yugoslav government in Paris. But there is no reason for indignation here. The Yugoslav government had set itself a task when sending the representative, namely, to create a false impression in the minds of the Yugoslav people that it was still supposedly maintaining friendly relations with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Foreign Minister did not receive the Yugoslav representative in order to shatter this false impression and to show that the Soviet government does not intend to help the Yugoslav government deceive its people. Let the various peoples of Yugoslavia know that the Soviet government does not regard the current Yugoslav government as a friend and ally, but as an enemy and opponent of the Soviet Union."

　　关于南斯拉夫对奥要求问题
    苏联政府再复南照会揭发铁托集团假面具
    【新华社北平十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科十一日电，苏联政府致南斯拉夫政府复文。
    如报纸前已报道，七月十九日，苏联政府曾照会南斯拉夫政府，答复南斯拉夫关于苏联在讨论对奥和约草案中对南斯拉夫的对奥要求的态度的照会，八月三日，南斯拉夫政府再度照会苏联政府。八月十一日，苏联政府致南斯拉夫复文，内容如下：
    “苏联政府鉴于南斯拉夫今年八月三日的照会，认为有必要作下述的声明：
    苏联政府且不提南斯拉夫政府八月三日照会中的无礼腔调，也且不提南斯拉夫政府从法西斯武库捡来的对苏联外交政策的诬蔑捏造。苏联政府并没有从南斯拉夫现政府方面期望任何别的东西，因为既已背离了社会主义和民主的阵营，而投到外国资本与反动派的阵营，南斯拉夫政府违反两国政府间往还上的基本礼节法则，并一再重述法西斯分子反苏联的毁谤性谴责，实无足惊奇。
    让我们来看看事实吧。
    苏联曾支持南对奥要求
    铁托集团出卖民族利益背信弃义一再改变方案
    （一）第二次世界大战结束后，南斯拉夫政府提出它对奥地利的经济与领土的要求，要求斯洛文族加林西亚与斯提里亚的斯洛文族边疆区（总面积二千六百方公里，人口约十九万）应给予南斯拉夫。苏联政府曾担承支持这些要求的义务并在外长会议上支持了它们以反对美英法。
    一九四七年四月，南斯拉夫副总理卡德尔先生代表南斯拉夫政府向维辛斯基致送专函，其中提出南斯拉夫政府关于南对奥要求的新态度。从卡德尔先生信中可以看到这一新态度的实质，即为南斯拉夫政府并不打算从西方国家方面获得南斯拉夫要求的满足，因此，建议放弃斯洛文族加林西亚，并将其要求仅限于德拉瓦河上两个电力站附近的小块领土。卡德尔写道：“问题可以借对边界略加修改而解决，为此目的，我向你提出两个方案的草案，最后并可由确立南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国在这些动力站管理机构中的特别权利而解决问题。”
    第一种方案，是把面积二一○方公里拥有人口九千三百九十六人的奥国领土移转给南斯拉夫。第二种方案是限于把面积六十三方公里拥有人口三千一百五十人的奥国领土移转给南斯拉夫。可是，这里还有第三种方案。这个方案在卡德尔的信中是用上面已经提到过的方式表示的：“问题可以借对边境略加修改而解决，为此目的，我向你提出两个方案的草案，最后并可由确立南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国在这些动力站管理机构中的特别权利而解决问题”。换句话说，南斯拉夫放弃其一切对奥领土要求，而把它的要求仅限于使南斯拉夫获得在别人领土上的两个电力站的管理机构中的特别权利。
    由此可见，在一九四七年四月时南斯拉夫政府即已认为有必要不仅放弃斯洛文族加林西亚，不仅放弃构成斯洛文族加林西亚之一部的小块领土，而且有必要放弃对奥国的一切领土要求。
    这是当苏联政府在与西方国家代表的会议上为南斯拉夫维护对斯洛文族加林西亚的要求的时候的事。
    这是一个无可争辩的事实。
    南斯拉夫政府在其八月三日的照会中特别指出放弃斯洛文族加林西亚乃是背信弃义，乃是对加林西亚的斯洛文族居民利益的出卖，乃是侵犯民族自决权，乃是帝国主义政策的表现，乃是把斯洛文族加林西亚当作零钱挥霍等等。如果真有背信弃义和出卖南斯拉夫利益的事，那末，象在卡德尔的信里可以看到的，南斯拉夫政府，而且也只有南斯拉夫政府应被认为是出卖者和背叛者。
    铁托集团卑鄙阴谋
    利用放弃领土要求诬蔑苏联欺骗人民
    （二）南斯拉夫政府在做这种让步和放弃它的领土要求时，似乎就应对这种态度负责。但是南斯拉夫政府却另有打算。它认为苏联政府应该替它自己宣布这些让步而且对这件事倡议并担负充分的责任。就南斯拉夫政府而言，它却应该置身事外，对于南斯拉夫政府在一九四七年四月认定有必要放弃斯洛文族加林西亚一事不担负任何责任。当一九四七年八月苏联大使拉夫伦捷夫在被接待时向南斯拉夫总理铁托（当时卡德尔亦在场）问南斯拉夫政府是否想要正式宣布它的新态度的时候，铁托回答说（尚有苏联大使的笔录可查）：如果要求南斯拉夫政府发表关于放弃对斯洛文族加林西亚的要求的正式声明，南斯拉夫政府不能作这样声明。南斯拉夫宁愿放弃它的最低要求，也不愿发表这样的声明。
    由此可见，按照南斯拉夫政府的计划，苏联政府应该对放弃斯洛文族加林西亚，并且一般地对放弃南斯拉夫一切领土要求一事担负责任，而南斯拉夫政府则应该置身事外，以便在南斯拉夫人民的心目中造成一种错误的印象，即南斯拉夫政府据说是继续保持要求斯洛文族加林西亚划归南斯拉夫的原来立场的，因此倡议放弃对斯洛文族加林西亚的，不是出于南斯拉夫政府，而是出于苏联政府。简言之，就是建议苏联充当欺骗南斯拉夫人民——南斯拉夫政府所制造的骗局——的工具。南斯拉夫政府天真地以为苏联政府会屈从这种政治上的狡猾手段。
    这是可以理解的，苏联政府不能屈从于这种卑鄙的阴谋。苏联政府宣称：如果南斯拉夫政府忠实地、正式地与完全负责任地提出这些要求的话，它（指苏联政府——译者）准备为南斯拉夫要求而辩护，但苏联不能为南斯拉夫政府实际上业已放弃了的要求辩护。
    鉴于这些事实，苏联外交部认为必须驳斥南斯拉夫政府八月三日照会中的断言，说什么苏联政府代表曾不论在什么时候都建议过南斯拉夫应降低它的领土要求。这种断言的虚伪性，从下述一事就可看出：远在一九四七年十一月，苏联驻南斯拉夫大使在答复南斯拉夫外交部的询问时，告后者称：苏联认为要南斯拉夫降低它对奥领土要求一事并无任何根据。不仅如此，在一九四八年，当南斯拉夫外交部长西米区先生通知苏联大使，据说苏联驻伦敦大使查鲁宾曾劝告南斯拉夫代表贝勃勒在对奥和约外长助理会议上提出一种与其原来要求根本不同的关于南斯拉夫领土要求，即要降低南斯拉夫要求的建议的时候，苏联大使巴夫伦捷夫曾答称：“贝勃勒春季在伦敦曾向受权谈判对奥和约的苏联代表科克托莫夫建议在四国会议上提出包含有降低南斯拉夫对奥领土要求的提案。贝勃勒在与苏联驻伦敦大使查鲁宾谈话中也提过同一建议。贝勃勒这一建议均为科克托莫夫及苏联大使查鲁宾所拒绝。当时曾向贝勃勒指出：苏联代表团将支持由南斯拉夫代表自行正式提出的建议。”
    铁托背着苏联与英密谈　牺牲斯洛文族人民利益
    （三）与此同时，象后来所查明的，南斯拉夫政府还背着苏联政府，与英国代表在贝尔格莱德和伦敦举行秘密会谈，与他们谈判放弃斯洛文族加林西亚，而对苏联保守着秘密。虽然苏联与南斯拉夫订有同盟条约，但苏联政府一直不知道这些绅士们究竟协议了一些什么。南斯拉夫政府坚持说在这些会谈中没有瞒着苏联什么东西——这里指的是卡德尔先生给维辛斯基的信。但是在卡德尔的信里，丝毫没有谈到南斯拉夫政府想在上述基础上与英国代表进行谈判。在南斯拉夫代表与苏联代表的迭次会谈中，也没有这方面的任何暗示。不仅如此，与英国代表间所进行的上述幕后谈判已经完毕了，但南斯拉夫政府继续把这些谈判的结果瞒着苏联政府，不认为有必要通知苏联政府。从那时以来，两年已经过去了，但是一直到今天，苏联政府还不知道这些幕后谈判的结果是什么和它们目的是反对着谁的，因为，南斯拉夫政府被苏联大使追问得没法而被迫告诉后者的东西，甚至不到实际谈判情形的十分之一。有一件事是没有疑问的，即在这些幕后谈判中，牺牲加林西亚的斯洛文族人利益——损害南斯拉夫民族权利的密约是谈妥了的。
    （四）南斯拉夫的照会虚假地和诽谤地指出，苏联政府不想驳斥奥国报纸的消息，据说“斯大林曾答应奥地利共和国总统伦纳，保证奥国一九三八年边界”。南斯拉夫政府知道，奥国报纸这种消息是虚假的和捏造的。南斯拉夫政府既曾经由它驻莫斯科大使波普维区得到关于所说这封信（指斯大林致伦纳的信——译者）的内容的通知，它也知道这封信根本没有提到“保证奥地利边界”的事，因此没有任何必要去驳斥奥国报纸这种造谣消息。现在，南斯拉夫政府提出可笑的说法，说这个消息从来没有被苏联通讯社否认过。附带说一句，南斯拉夫政府自己——象它所知道的——那时曾经说过反对任何否认。
    由此可见，南斯拉夫政府因热中于污蔑苏联，而被迫驳斥了它自己。
    南政府依附帝国主义苏不再支持铁托要求
    （五）所有这些情况使苏联政府得出结论：南斯拉夫政府违背了对苏联的同盟义务；它的行为不是作为苏联的同盟者而是作为反对者的；某种强有力的纽带，把南斯拉夫政府或该政府中的主要人物与外国资本家阵营紧缚在一起了；南斯拉夫政府是越来越密切地依附于帝国主义集团以反对苏联，并且与帝国主义集团狼狈为奸；苏联政府已再不能把南斯拉夫政府当作苏联的盟邦了；苏联政府已再不能支持南斯拉夫政府的要求，特别是南斯拉夫政府自己业已放弃了的那些要求，虽然它还把这种放弃瞒着南斯拉夫人民；假如南斯拉夫政府宁愿和帝国主义集团结成联合阵线，而不和苏联结成联合阵线，那么，就让帝国主义集团去支持它的要求好了。
    讲到巴黎外长会议上一次会议，苏联政府明白，南斯拉夫政府在斯洛文族加林西亚的问题上正玩弄它的两面计划，这计划就是，一方面官样文章地坚持要把斯洛文族加林西亚移转给南斯拉夫共和国，另一方面实际上南斯拉夫政府却在瞒过苏联的秘密谈判中已与西方国家谈妥了放弃这个态度和放弃斯洛文族加林西亚的密约。苏联政府自然不愿意与南斯拉夫政府所奉行的这种欺骗南斯拉夫人民的政策，有任何共同之点，并且自然也就不应支持南斯拉夫政府事实上远在一九四七年四月卡德尔致书维辛斯基时就已经放弃了的立场。
    （六）南斯拉夫政府在其照会中对于苏联外长在巴黎拒绝接见南斯拉夫政府代表一事表示愤慨。但是这里丝毫没有愤慨的理由。南斯拉夫政府在派遣代表时就已给自己定了一个任务，即在南斯拉夫人民心目中造成一种它还在所谓继续与苏联保持友好关系的错误印象。苏联外长没有接见南斯拉夫代表是为了粉碎这种错误印象并表示苏联政府不打算帮助南斯拉夫政府欺骗其人民。让南斯拉夫各族人民知道，苏联政府并不把南斯拉夫现政府当作朋友和同盟者，而把它当作苏联的敌人与反对者。”
