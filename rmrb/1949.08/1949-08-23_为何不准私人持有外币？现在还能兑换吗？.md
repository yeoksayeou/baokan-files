　　To the Editor:
    I have a friend who recently came from Hong Kong. Because he was unaware that private possession of foreign currency was prohibited in Tianjin and Beijing, he did not exchange all the foreign currency he brought when boarding the ship. He has now arrived in Beijing. Is it still possible to request an exchange from the People's Bank? If not, what remedy is available? I would appreciate a reply in your newspaper.
    Also, the People's Bank posts daily exchange rates for gold, silver, and foreign currency. Why is it necessary to prohibit the holding of foreign currency, while the holding of gold and silver is not prohibited?
  　Mr. Wang Hong:
    Regarding your inquiry about the private possession of foreign currency, the People's Bank of China has provided the following response:
    "(1) According to the regulations of the North China Foreign Exchange Control Measures, the foreign currency your friend brought from Hong Kong should have been exchanged into Renminbi or deposited in the original currency at the port exchange institutions of the Bank of China after disembarking. It should not have been brought to the mainland. Now that it has been brought to Beijing due to a lack of understanding of the laws, he should promptly go to the Bank of China in Beijing to explain the reason and exchange it for Renminbi.
    (2) Foreign currency cannot be allowed to be held by the people like gold and silver because an independent and sovereign country will never allow foreign currency to invade. During the Kuomintang rule, US dollars and Hong Kong dollars flooded the domestic market, replacing the status of the national currency; this is one of the hallmarks of the semi-colonial China under the Kuomintang rule. To establish an independent and sovereign monetary system, we must never allow the paper scraps of imperialism (foreign currency) to plunder the wealth of our people and motherland. According to the provisions of the foreign exchange control measures, all foreign currency must be exchanged at the Bank of China or exchanged for foreign exchange deposit certificates. Private buying and selling and pricing and circulation in the market are strictly prohibited. This is the reason." (People's Bank of China)

### 为何不准私人持有外币？现在还能兑换吗？

　　为何不准私人持有外币？现在还能兑换吗？编辑同志：
    我有一个朋友，最近从香港来，因为不知平津已禁止私存外币，故在上船时未将全部所带之外币兑换，现已到北平，是否仍能向人民银行请求兑换？如果不能，有何补救之法？祈在贵报赐复。
    又人民银行对金、银、外币均逐日挂牌，为何必须禁止外币持有，而金银则不禁止持有？  
  　王洪王洪先生：
    你所询关于私持外币问题，承中国人民银行答复如下：　“（一）你朋友从香港带来之外币按华北区外汇管理办法之规定，应于下船后在中国银行的口境兑换机构兑成人民券或作原币存款，根本不应携带到内地来，现在既系因不了解法令而带到北平，应从速到北平中国银行说明理由兑成人民券。
    （二）外币是不能象金银一样允许人民持有的，因为一个独立自主的国家，是决不允许外币侵入的。国民党统治时期美钞港币充斥于国内市场，代替了国家货币的地位；这是国民党统治的半殖民地中国烙印之一。我们要建立独立自主的货币体系，决不能让帝国主义的纸片（外币）来掠夺我们人民祖国的财富，必须按照外汇管理办法的规定，所有外币都要到中国银行兑换或换取外汇存单，绝对禁止在市场上私相买卖和计价流通，也就是这个道理。”（中国人民银行）
