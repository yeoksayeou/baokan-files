Maternal and child health, although it has a history of more than twenty years in our country, and various maternal and child health institutions have been established in major cities, and a foundation has also been laid for the training of midwives. However, the government under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries has never regarded public health (including maternal and child health) as a work urgently needed by the people, thus forming:

(1) Focusing on urban maternal and child health, while neglecting rural maternal and child health—for example, in one district of Beiping, due to the abundance of medical institutions, the infant mortality rate had already dropped to 83.8 per thousand in 1948; while in Bishan County, Chongqing, the infant mortality rate remained at a high record of 170.9 per thousand in 1945. In more remote rural areas, the infant mortality figure may be as high as 200 per thousand.

(2) Focusing on training senior maternal and child health workers, while neglecting the training of rural maternal and child health workers—resulting in a surplus of urban maternal and child health personnel.

(3) Forcing maternal and child health onto the people without considering their needs—in the past, a set of "dogmas" was designed and forced onto the people, without understanding the living conditions and habits of the rural people, and providing guidance and improvement.

Now that the whole country is about to be completely liberated, the promotion of maternal and child health in the work of building a new China is bound to be an important and urgent task. We hope that every child of the next generation will be given reasonable and scientific care from the fetal period as far as possible. In this way, each child can achieve the physical and mental development and health they deserve. To achieve this goal, I believe that the most important tasks for our maternal and child health workers at present are the following three:

(1) Actively train rural maternal and child health workers—At present, more than 80% of China's population lives in rural areas. Therefore, we should try our best to mobilize maternal and child health workers in large cities to go to the countryside to promote rural maternal and child health work and personnel training. At the same time, we must also mobilize maternal and child health institutions in each city to provide general rural maternal and child health trainees with internship opportunities. Regarding the basic tasks of these rural maternal and child health personnel, we hope that they can save the generally unjustly dead infants due to tetanus. Assuming that according to China's population of 450 million, a birth rate of 30 per thousand, an infant mortality rate of 200 per thousand, and 32.5 percent of infant deaths are caused by tetanus, 877,500 infants can be saved each year. What a great harvest that would be!

(2) Universally establish nurseries and train nursery workers—The establishment of nurseries has two tasks. On the one hand, it can liberate married women from the family. More importantly, we believe that caring for children so that they can reach the highest degree of physical and mental development requires a highly specialized science and technology. Most parents do not understand the various needs of children in all aspects during their developmental stages. The exorbitant infant and child mortality rates are ironclad proof. We must not only passively reduce the mortality rate, but also actively organize childcare institutions and use scientific and rational methods to care for children, so that each child can obtain a balanced, pleasant, and highly healthy development in all aspects, as well as collective living habits from birth onwards. However, the childcare industry is still a new undertaking in the newly liberated cities, and the lack of child care personnel has become the biggest problem at present. Therefore, the establishment of nurseries and the training of nursery workers is undoubtedly one of the important tasks of our maternal and child work at present, and it is worthy of our greatest efforts to promote.

(3) Establish child development research institutions—Child disease science has a history of hundreds of years, but researching the normal development of children is a very new science. Although this is a paradoxical phenomenon, many successful histories have been formed in this way. In scientifically advanced countries, the study of child development has at most a history of only a few decades. In other words, mankind has only realized that children need a normal development in the last few decades. Until today, our China does not have a scientific institution to specialize in this research. Therefore, in any aspect, we do not have a standard for normal child development, and even the normal range of height and weight has not been determined. This has fostered the bad habit of taking foreign standards as our standards in everything. For example, foreign babies need to be fed milk every four hours, and we also learn from them to breastfeed every four hours. Now, according to the latest psychology, foreign breastfeeding methods have been changed to breastfeed the baby at any time according to the baby's needs. Understanding the normal development of children is a condition that every medical student should possess. Without the standard of normal development, how can we lead children to the road of normal development? If the definition of disease is a deviated development, without the knowledge of normal development, how can we have the correct knowledge of disease? Therefore, in order to actively promote the normal development of children, and passively to better understand pathological abnormalities, our China urgently needs to establish several, at least one, institution to study the normal development of children.

    目前妇婴卫生工作的任务
    叶恭绍
    妇婴卫生，在我国虽然有了二十多年的历史，在各大城市也曾设立了各种妇婴保健机构，并且对于助产士的训练也打下了一个基础。但是在国民党反动派统治下的政府，向来没有把公共卫生（包括妇婴卫生）看作是一种人民迫切需要的工作，因此便形成了：
    （一）着重城市妇婴卫生，而忽略了乡村妇婴卫生——例如北平市内一区因为医药机构林立，在一九四八年婴儿死亡率已经降到千分之八三·八；而在重庆的璧山县，婴儿死亡率，在一九四五年仍然保持着千分之一七○·九的高纪录。在更偏僻的乡间婴儿死亡的数字可能高到千分之二○○。
    （二）着重训练高级妇婴卫生工作人员，而忽略了训练乡村妇婴卫生工作人员——结果造成了城市妇婴卫生人员过剩的现象。
    （三）把妇婴卫生硬按在人民身上，而没有顾及到人民的需要——以往常是把“教条”设计好的一套工作硬放在人民身上。而没有去了解农村人民的生活条件、习惯，予以指导和改善。
    现在全国将要完全解放，在建设新中国的工作中，妇婴卫生的推进，必然是一个重要的任务，也是刻不容缓的任务。我们希望，下一代的每一个儿童，从胎儿时期起，在可能的范围，给以合理科学的照顾。这样，每个儿童才能达到他所应有的身心发育和健康。要达到这个目标，我认为我们妇婴卫生工作人员目前最重要的任务，有下列三种：
    （一）积极训练乡村妇婴卫生工作人员——目前我国百分之八十以上的人口住在乡村，因此我们应尽量发动大城市的妇婴卫生工作人员下乡去，推动乡村的妇婴卫生工作和人员的训练工作。同时还要发动每个城市里的妇婴卫生机构，供给一般乡村妇婴卫生学员实习的机会。对于这些乡村妇婴卫生人员基本任务，我们希望他们能救活一般因破伤风而冤死的婴儿。假设按照中国四万万五千万的人口，千分之三十的出生率，千分之二百的婴儿死亡率，百分之三二·五的破伤风婴儿死亡原因来计算，每年能救活八十七万七千五百个婴儿。那是多么大的一个收获！
    （二）普遍设立托儿所及训练托儿所工作人员——托儿所的设立，有两方面的任务。一方面可以把已婚的妇女由家庭解放出来。更重要的一方面我们认为保育儿童，使他们能达到身心最高度的发展，是需要一种极专门的科学技术。大多数的父母对于儿童发育时期各方面的各种需要，不很懂得。超格的婴儿死亡率与儿童死亡率，便是铁一般的证明。我们不但要消极的减低死亡率，还要极积的组织托儿机关，用科学的合理的方法来保育儿童。使每个儿童从出生以后，在各方面能够得到一种平衡的，愉快的，高度的健康发展，以及集体的生活习惯。但是托儿事业在新解放的城市还是一种新的事业，儿童保育人员的缺乏，便成了目前最大的问题。所以托儿所的设立及托儿所工作人员的训练，无疑的，是我们妇婴工作目前的重要任务之一，是值得我们用最大的努力来推进的。
    （三）成立儿童发育研究机构——儿童疾病学已有了几百年的历史，研究儿童的正常发育倒是一种很新的科学，这虽然是一种矛盾的现象，可是许多成功的历史却是这样演成的。在科学前进的国家，研究儿童发育最多也不过有几十年的历史。换句话说，人类感觉到儿童需要一种正常的发育，也不过是最近几十年的事。我们中国直到今天还没有一个科学机关，来专门从事这项的研究。因此，我们在任何方面，也没有一个正常儿童发育的标准，就连身长体重的正常范围也没有确定。这样便养成了事事都拿外国的标准来作我们的标准的恶习惯。例如外国婴儿喂牛奶需要每四小时一次，我们喂母乳也学他们每四小时一次。现在外国哺乳的方法，根据最新的心理学，已经改变到按照婴儿的需要随时给他哺乳了。对于儿童正常发育的了解，是每一个医学生应当具备的条件。没有正常发育的标准，怎能领导儿童走向正常发育的道路呢？如果疾病的定义是一种偏差的发育，没有正常发育的知识，怎么能有正确的疾病的知识呢？所以，积极的为了促进儿童的正常发育，消极的为了更明了病理的变态，我们中国急需设立几个，至少一个，研究儿童正常发育的机构。
