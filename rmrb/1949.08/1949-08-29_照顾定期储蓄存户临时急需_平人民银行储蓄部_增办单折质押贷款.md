　　To Accommodate the Temporary Urgent Needs of Regular Savings Account Holders
    The Savings Department of the People's Bank of Ping [Beijing]
  　Increases Single-Account Collateral Loans
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Savings Department of the People's Bank of Ping [Beijing] Branch has increased single-account collateral loan services for regular savings account holders. In order to accommodate regular savings account holders who may have special circumstances and temporary urgent needs for funds, the department will begin offering this service on September 1st. The procedures are as follows: (1) Any individual who has opened a fixed-term savings deposit account with the department for more than one month and who has a temporary urgent need for funds due to marriage, funeral, illness, official transfer, or an unexpected event in an organization or group, may obtain appropriate certification and apply to the department for a collateral loan using the original deposit passbook in accordance with the prescribed procedures. (2) For real-value single-account collateral loans, both the principal and interest are calculated in real-value units based on the exchange rate on the date of payment. For currency single-account collateral loans, both payments and receipts are calculated in currency. (3) The term of the collateral loan shall be determined by the depositor, but shall not be less than ten days or exceed the maturity date of the pledged deposit passbook. Once agreed, the term cannot be extended. (4) The loan amount shall be calculated based on the number of real-value units or the currency amount remaining in the passbook at the time of application. Loans will be granted at 40% to 60% of the value depending on the length of time the deposit has been held. (5) After a deposit passbook has been used for collateral within the above limits, those with "lump-sum deposit with installments withdrawals" must continue to deposit on schedule, and those with "lump-sum deposit with installment interest payments" and "deposit principal with interest payments" shall not continue to withdraw principal and interest. Each time a payment is due, the department will make the withdrawal to repay the loan. (6) Loan interest will be calculated on a monthly basis. For real-value single-account collateral loans with a term of one month, the interest rate will be 1.5 li higher than the original deposit rate, and will increase by 5 hao for each additional month. For currency single-account collateral loans with a term of one month, the interest rate will be 5 fen higher than the original passbook rate, and will increase by 1 fen for each additional month. (7) Depositors must repay the principal and interest of the loan upon maturity. If the loan is repaid before maturity or after maturity, the calculation of the real-value unit exchange rate and interest rate will be subject to separate regulations. If the loan is not repaid by the maturity date of the passbook, the department will take the initiative to withdraw all principal and interest from the passbook to repay the loan principal and interest. If the proceeds are insufficient, the department will pursue the borrower for the remaining amount.

    【本报讯】人民银行北平分行储蓄部，增办定期储蓄存户单折质押贷款业务。该部为照顾定期储蓄存户，遇有特殊事故临时急需款项起见，特自九月一日起增办是项业务，其办法：（一）凡在该部开立定期储蓄存款户，存满一个月以上，私人如有婚丧疾病、因公调职或机关团体有意外事故需用款项者，可取得相当证明，按照规定手续以原开存款单折向该部申请质押贷款。（二）折实单折质押贷款，借还本息均以折实单位按收付日之牌价折算。货币单折质押贷款收付均以货币计算。（三）质押贷款之期限由存户自定，但最短不得少于十日，最长不得超过抵押单折到期之日。约定后不得转期。（四）贷款数额以存户申请时，单折结存之实物单位或货币金额数为计算标准。根据已存时间之长短，照四至六折贷给。（五）存款单折照上项限额办理质押后，“零存整付”者仍须按期续存，“整存零付”及“存本付息”之存户不得续支本息，每次到期由该部代提抵还借款。（六）贷款利息以月息计。折实单折押借期限一个月者利率较原存利率增加一厘五，每多一月增加五毫。货币单折押借期限一个月者利率较原存单折增加五分，每多一月增加一分。（七）存户办理贷款到期必须清还本息，如于期前偿还或逾期偿还，其折实单位牌价及利率之计算另有规定。如至单折到期仍未清还，该部即主动将单折本息全部提出抵还贷款本息，不足时仍向借款人追偿。
