　　Public Security Headquarters, Please Investigate Squad Marches on Tram Tracks
　　At 5:58 PM on August 3rd, tram number 102 was traveling from Xidan towards Xizhimen. At that time, personnel from a certain team of the Public Security Headquarters, about fifty or sixty people, were also walking north from Xidan. The comrade leading them, seeing the tram approaching from behind, did not move to the side of the road, but continued walking on the tracks. Although the tram driver warned by ringing the bell, they ignored it. By this time, they had already traveled from Xidan to Gangwa City, and five trams were successively crowded behind. Because the delay was quite long, the passengers in the tram were very dissatisfied, believing that public security personnel should maintain public transportation and should not obstruct the city's vehicles in this way. At that time, Comrade Cao Baochang of the Peking University Publishing Department got off the tram and negotiated with the team, asking them to make way, but to no avail. The team blocked the tram from Xidan to Taipingcang before turning east. When the tram arrived at Taipingcang, it was already 6:37 PM, according to the timetable, the tram was 21 minutes late. Such a thing is a first in post-liberation Beiping. For the sake of the city's traffic order, and to prevent the people's enterprises from suffering time losses, we respectfully request the Public Security Headquarters to pay attention to maintaining public transportation order and hope for an investigation!

　　电车道上结队行进公安总队请作检查
    八月三日下午五点五十八分，有一路一○二号电车，自西单向西直门开行。是时，公安总队某队人员，约五六十名，亦自西单往北行走。他们的领队同志，看见后面的电车来了，并不向路边躲闪，一直在轨道上走。电车的司机员虽然踏铃警告，然而他们置若罔闻。这时，已经由西单行到缸瓦市，后面陆续的挤着五趟电车。因为时间颇有拖延，车内乘客很不满意，认为公安人员应该维持公共交通，不应如此妨碍市内车辆行驶。当时，北大出版部曹宝诚同志，下车与该队人中交涉，请其让路，结果无效。该队自西单压车至太平仓，始拐弯向东行去。而电车到太平仓时，已是六点三十七分，根据行车时刻，电车慢点二十一分。这样的事情，解放后的北平尚属初次。为了全市的交通秩序，为了保持人民的企业不受时间损失，谨请公安总队注意维持公共交通秩序，并盼作一检查！
