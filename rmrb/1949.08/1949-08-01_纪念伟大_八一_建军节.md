    Commemorating the Great "August 1st" Army Day
    Ma Xulun, Standing Director of the China Association for Promoting Democracy
    Our commemoration of the great "August 1st" Army Day this year is incomparable to previous years. Now, relying on the People's Liberation Army, we have achieved a basic victory in the Chinese revolution. Now, relying on the People's Liberation Army, the victory across the country is just around the corner. Without the incomparably powerful People's Liberation Army, no one would dare to dream of defeating the deeply entrenched imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucrat-capitalism concentrated in the Kuomintang reactionaries in China. At the same time, we must rely on the People's Liberation Army to suppress the remnants of the reactionary forces, so that they will never be able to turn over again, and to defend and consolidate a peaceful, democratic, unified, prosperous, and strong New China.
    Twenty-two years ago—in 1927—when the Kuomintang reactionaries betrayed the revolution and massacred the people, the Chinese Communist Party led the people to "rise from the underground, wipe the blood from their bodies, and bury the bodies of their comrades," and continued to fight. The first sound of the battle was the Nanchang Uprising on August 1st, which created the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, which belonged entirely to the people. When this army ascended Jinggang Mountain, their number was only about five or six thousand.
    But this army of five or six thousand, with incomplete equipment and insufficient supplies, gradually grew stronger. Relying on this army, China began to establish the Soviet in Jiangxi and launched the land revolution. Relying on this army, it defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries' five "encirclement and suppression" campaigns, marched gloriously, completed the 25,000-li Long March, and arrived victoriously in Shaanxi, preparing for the anti-Japanese work. After the "July 7th" Incident, it was again relying on this army that resisted 58 to 64 percent of all invading Japanese troops and more than 90 percent of all puppet troops. It persisted for eight years and finally defeated the enemy and the puppets. By the time of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, this army had grown into the People's Liberation Army of about one million.
    When the War of Liberation began, the reactionaries had a total force of 4.3 million, and they had many American equipment, and there was an American military advisory group planning and directing operations. The People's Liberation Army had a total force of only 1.2 million. Whether in terms of equipment, numbers, or scope of activities, the reactionaries had a great advantage. The reactionaries also felt confident and recklessly said that they would eliminate the Communist Party in three months or six months. However, after three years of the Liberation War, the reactionaries' total remaining force was only 1.49 million, while the People's Liberation Army had become a well-equipped army of 4 million. In the three years of the Liberation War, 5.69 million enemies were annihilated, more than 2.96 million square kilometers of area were liberated, more than 279 million people were liberated, 1,061 cities were liberated, and 21,600 kilometers of railways were liberated. Basically, the reactionary forces lost their resistance, making it impossible for them to linger on. The famous Battle of Jinzhou, the Battle of Western Liaoning, the Battle of Huaihai, and the crossing of the Yangtze River by a million-strong army were unprecedented not only in the Chinese war but also played a very important role in the world war. For example, the number of people in the Battle of Huaihai exceeded the Battle of Stalingrad. Although the reactionaries had a large number of bombers supplied by US imperialism to assist in the battle, the entire army was annihilated as a result. The Shanghai Campaign was personally commanded by the reactionary head Chiang Kai-shek, who vowed never to retreat. However, the People's Liberation Army completely destroyed Shanghai's modern fortifications in less than two weeks, capturing more than 100,000 people.
    The People's Liberation Army has not only developed into an iron army that is invincible in battle and invincible in attack, but also the strictness of its military discipline is rarely seen in the world. Not taking a single needle or thread from the people is the highest standard of a good army in Chinese history. But from the perspective of the People's Liberation Army, this is only passive and cannot explain the current discipline. Now, the People's Liberation Army is actively fighting on the one hand and serving the people on the other - carrying water, sweeping the floor, and even helping with production. After the People's Liberation Army entered Shanghai, they would rather rest on the street in the rain than enter the people's houses. The people sent condolences, and no matter how much, they politely refused (this is the case everywhere, here is the most recent example). This kind of self-sacrificing and selfless army that serves the people exclusively has not only moved the people of the whole country, but even the imperialist journalists in Shanghai have had to unanimously praise the discipline of the Chinese People's Liberation Army as being the best. Comparing it with the reactionary army, there is a world of difference.
    But why can the five or six thousand people in Jinggang Mountain develop into such a powerful and disciplined People's Liberation Army? As everyone knows, 70 to 80 percent of the current People's Liberation Army is supplemented by the reactionary army that has revolted, surrendered, and been captured. The reactionary army is so corrupt that it can have such discipline and power after being reorganized into the People's Liberation Army. This is the characteristic of the People's Liberation Army. Although the reactionaries have the economic assistance, military training, and new weapons of US imperialism, they can only surrender to the People's Liberation Army, and if they do not surrender, they will be eliminated. This is because the reactionary army fundamentally cannot have the characteristics that the People's Liberation Army has.
    The most basic characteristics of the People's Liberation Army are two points:
    First, the People's Liberation Army is the people's own army. The army helps the people, and the people help the army. Without the support of the people, the army is isolated and can never grow stronger, and can never defeat the Japanese invaders or destroy the reactionaries. Without their own army, the people cannot express their strength. Only when the people's own army is united with the people can it exert great and invincible power.
    Second, the People's Liberation Army is an army led by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, which is disciplined and armed with Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong Thought. With the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, who are in contact with the masses of the people, the People's Liberation Army can carry forward and develop in accordance with the will of the people. It has gone through tortuous roads, undergone many struggles and education, so that the People's Liberation Army can centrally express the firm will and great strength of the people of the whole country to destroy reactionary oppression and open up a broad road for the construction of a new China.
    Now that the national victory is imminent, the New Political Consultative Conference is about to open, the coalition government is about to be established, and national construction has begun smoothly. We cannot but thank the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army, and we cannot but thank the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Without the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, there would be no People's Liberation Army, and there would be no New China.
    As New China is born, we commemorate the great "August 1st" Army Day, and we feel its significance even more profound.
    The people of the whole country know the significance of the great "August 1st" Army Day, and we should, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, unite even more closely, and in all aspects of life such as production, culture, and education, and in each person's respective post, make the greatest efforts to support the front line, so that the People's Liberation Army can exert even greater power, quickly eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries who are "fish out of water", and resolutely defend New China.
    Long live the People's Liberation Army!
    Long live the liberation of China!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!
    Long live Chairman Mao!

    纪念伟大“八一”建军节
    中国民主促进会常务理事  马叙伦
    我们今年纪念伟大“八一”建军节，不是与往年可比的。现在我们依靠着人民解放军，在中国革命已经获得了基本胜利，现在我们依靠着人民解放军，使全国的胜利指日可待了。没有强大无比的人民解放军，谁也不敢梦想在中国能打垮这样根深蒂固的帝国主义、封建势力与官僚资本所集中表现的国民党反动派。同时我们还要依靠着人民解放军来镇压反动势力的残余，使它永不翻身，来保卫与巩固和平民主统一富强的新中国。
    二十二年前——一九二七年，当国民党反动派背叛革命，屠杀人民的时候，中国共产党领导着人民“从地下爬起来，揩干净身上的血迹，掩埋同伴的尸首”，继续战斗起来。战斗的第一声就是八月一日南昌起义；创立了完全属于人民的工农红军。这支军队等上井岗山时，他们的数目只有五六千左右了。
    但是这支五六千人的装备不全给养不足的军队，渐渐发展壮大起来了。依靠这支军队，中国开始在江西建立苏维埃，开展了土地革命。依靠这支军队，击败了国民党反动派的五次“围剿”，光荣的进军，完成了二万五千里长征，胜利的到达陕西，准备抗日工作。“七七”以后，又靠了这支军队，抗击了全部侵华日军的百分之五十八至六十四，同时又抗击了全部伪军百分之九十以上。竟然支持八年之久，终于击败了敌伪。抗战胜利的时候，这支军队已长成为约一百万的人民解放军了。
    当解放战争开始的时候，反动派全部兵力有四百三十万，而且有许多美式配备，并且有美国军事顾问团计划与指挥作战。而人民解放军全部兵力只有一百二十万，不论在配备方面，在人数方面，在活动范围方面，都是反动派占了很大优势。反动派也觉得有恃无恐，就妄言三个月或六个月消灭共产党了。但是三年的解放战争结果，反动派全部残余兵力只剩了一百四十九万，而人民解放军变成了配备精良的四百万大军了。三年的解放战争，歼敌五百六十九万，解放了二百九十六万余方公里的地区，解放了二亿七千九百余万人民，一千零六十一座城市，两万一千六百余公里铁路，基本上反动派消失了抵抗力量，使之无法苟延残喘了。著名的锦州之战，辽西之战，淮海之战，以及百万大军战斗渡江等，不独在中国战争中是史无前例的，即在世界战争中也占了很重要的地位。例如淮海之战的人数，就超过了斯大林格勒的战争。反动派虽有美帝供应的大批轰炸机协助作战，结果全军被歼灭。上海战役是反动派头子蒋介石亲自指挥海陆空军的，扬言决不退却。但是人民解放军不到两星期即将上海近代工事完全摧毁，俘虏达十万以上。
    人民解放军不但发展为战无不胜攻无不取的铁军，而且军队纪律的严明是世所罕见的。秋毫无犯，是中国历史上好军队的最高标准。但是由人民解放军来说，这仅是消极的，不能说明现在的纪律了。现在人民解放军处处积极的一面打仗，一面为老百姓服务——挑水、扫地，甚至帮助生产。当人民解放军进入上海以后，他们宁可冒着雨在街旁休息，决不进人民房，老百姓送慰劳品，无论多少一概婉拒（到处都是这样，这里是举最近的例子）。这种自我牺牲、大公无私专为老百姓服务的军队，不独全国人民感动，就是上海帝国主义的记者们，也不得不一致称赞中国人民解放军的纪律是好到顶点的。再与反动派军队一比较，真有天壤之别了。
    但是为什么井岗山的五六千人，能发展到有这样威力兼有这样纪律的强大无比的人民解放军呢？大家知道，现在人民解放军中有百分之七十到八十是由反动派起义的投降的被俘的军队补充的。反动派的军队是这样腐败，改编为人民解放军后，即能有这样纪律与威力。这就是人民解放军的特质。反动派虽有美帝国主义的经济援助，军事训练与新式武器，只能向人民解放军投降，不投降就被消灭。就因为反动派的军队，根本上无法有人民解放军所有的特质。
    人民解放军最基本的特质有两点：
    第一，人民解放军是人民自己的军队，军队帮助人民，人民帮助军队。没有人民的支持，军队是孤立的，决不能发展壮大，也决不能打败日寇，击毁反动派。人民没有自己的军队，就不能表现自己的力量。只有人民自己的军队与人民联合在一起，才能发挥伟大无比不可战胜的力量。
    第二，人民解放军是由一个有纪律有马列理论与毛泽东思想武装的中国共产党及毛主席领导的军队。有了与人民群众联系在一起的中国共产党与毛主席的领导，人民解放军就能依照人民的意志发扬光大了。其中走过了曲折的道路，经过了不少的斗争与教育，使人民解放军能集中表现出全国人民的坚定的意志与伟大的力量，来摧毁反动的压迫，为建设新中国开辟了康庄大道。
    现在全国胜利即在目前，新政治协商会议即将开幕，联合政府即将成立，全国建设已在顺利开始，中国能够进入新的人民的时代，不能不感谢人民解放军伟大的功绩，不能不感谢中国共产党与毛主席的领导。没有中国共产党，没有毛主席，就没有人民解放军，也就没有了新中国。
    在新中国诞生的时候，我们来纪念伟大的“八一”建军节，愈觉得意义深长。
    我们全国人民知道伟大“八一”建军节的意义，就应当在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，更加团结起来，在生产文化教育各方面的生活上，在每个人民各自岗位上，来尽最大的努力支援前线，使人民解放军更能发挥伟大的力量，迅速消灭“釜底游魂”的国民党反动派，坚决保卫新中国。
    人民解放军万岁！
    中国解放万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    朱总司令万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
