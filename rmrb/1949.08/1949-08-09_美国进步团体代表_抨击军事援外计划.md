　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, August 8th: TASS, Washington reports: On August 5th, several progressives testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, opposing the military aid program that leads to a new war. Rieve, Secretary-General of the "National Council for Prevention of War," particularly criticized the clause in the plan that authorizes the president to supply any country with military equipment and materials and to interfere in every revolution. Morale, the representative of the "Women's International League for Peace and Freedom," criticized the military aid program as the second step towards war. This plan will only increase the profits of a very small number of commercial groups in the United States and Europe. Wood, the representative of the "Friends Committee on National Legislation," emphasized the importance of disarmament plans. Harrison, Chairman of the "American Veterans Committee," pointed out the necessity and possibility of peacefully resolving differences between the East and the West.
