Denounce the U.S. Imperialist White Paper

More than three weeks ago, the U.S. State Department published a White Paper, confessing the crimes of U.S. imperialism's long-term aggression against China and admitting the fact of assisting the Kuomintang reactionaries. Not only that, the White Paper further exposed the U.S. imperialists' determination to continue to undermine the Chinese revolution. The U.S. imperialists will do evil to the end, never giving up until they are completely destroyed.

In the White Paper, the U.S. imperialists repeatedly mentioned that their past actions were for the traditional friendship between China and the United States; their future actions are also for the traditional friendship between China and the United States. Yes, there is indeed a profound friendship between the broad masses of people of China and the United States. This friendship will not be eliminated by the ferocity of U.S. imperialism. On the contrary, it will be strengthened with the growth of the power of the people of the world. However, who doesn't know that the U.S. imperialists, like the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, are the haze in the friendship between the two peoples? The Chinese people know this, and the progressive people of the United States also know it. The unanimous condemnation of the White Paper by the Chinese people and the progressive people of the United States in the past three weeks shows that the people's eyes are discerning.

We, the members of the College Faculty and Staff Union and the Primary and Secondary School Faculty and Staff Union, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, will certainly unite with the Chinese people to oppose U.S. imperialism to the end, until U.S. imperialist aggression is completely eliminated. Any sweet talk or deceptive tricks of U.S. imperialism will only encounter ruthless exposure and unanimous strikes. We must not allow any sweet talk or deceptive tricks to have any of the effects expected by the U.S. imperialists in the independent, free, and democratic New China. On the contrary, we will increase our vigilance, work hard to defend ourselves, and drive the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism out of the country.

One of the vicious schemes of U.S. imperialism is to lure those it considers "democratic individualists" to be tools of its aggression. We are intellectuals. We do not deny that among us, there have been many liberals, many who have accepted the old democracy, the American-style democracy, believing it to be a progressive ideology. However, with the increasing ferocity of imperialist aggression and the cumulative harm inflicted on the Chinese people by imperialism's internal support for reactionary forces, the vast majority of these liberals have long recognized the hypocrisy of the old democracy and the inseparable nature of the old democracy and imperialism out of love for their motherland. They have awakened, they have progressed. With the development of the people's liberation cause, they have joined the ranks of the people. They are determined to learn from the Soviet Union. They are also determined to draw closer to the Soviet Union. A very small number of scum, such as Hu Shih and his ilk, who are willing to be running dogs of imperialism, have already fled to Guangzhou, Taiwan, and the United States. We tell the U.S. imperialists: if you want to find running dogs, find tools, go and find them! We are prepared to thoroughly eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang will also be the elimination of these scum. Go and find them, we do not forbid you.

The liberals and old-fashioned democrats who remain in our ranks, that is, the "democratic individualists" in the eyes of the U.S. imperialists, are decreasing. Acheson posted recruitment advertisements in the White Paper, attempting to lure these people to join the gang. But we will certainly, as Comrade Lin Boqu said in his concluding remarks at the symposium of Chinese social science workers, "use the White Paper to make them also recognize U.S. imperialism and unite in the great Chinese people's revolutionary cause." All the faculty and staff in Peiping, let us be vigilant, let us unite, unite all our colleagues, to expose the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism, to fight against U.S. imperialism, and not stop until victory.

　　北平院校教职联、中小学教职联
  　斥美帝白皮书
    三周余以前美国国务院发表了一本白皮书，招供了美帝国主义长期侵略中国的罪状，承认了帮助国民党反动派的事实。不仅如此，白皮书更暴露了美帝决心继续破坏中国革命的阴谋。美帝将作恶到底，不到黄河心不死，直到它自己崩溃灭亡为止。
    在白皮书中，美帝口口声声说到它过去的作为是为了中美的传统友谊；将来的行动也是为了中美传统的友谊。是的，中美两国广大人民间，确实存在着悠厚的友谊。这个友谊将不会因美帝的凶恶而消灭。相反的，它将随着全世界人民力量的增长而加强。但是，谁不知道美帝正如蒋介石匪帮一般，是两国人民间友谊的阴霾？中国的人民知道，美国进步的人民也知道。三周以来中国人民和美国进步人民对白皮书的同声斥责，就可以知道人民眼睛都是雪亮的。
    我们院校教职联及中小学教职联同人，在中国共产党领导之下，一定和中国人民团结在一起，反对美帝到底，直到美帝侵略完全消灭为止。美帝任何的花言巧语蛊惑伎俩，将只会遭遇无情的戳穿，一致的打击。我们决不能让任何花言巧语，任何蛊惑伎俩，在独立自由民主的新中国，发生美帝所预期的任何作用。相反的，我们将增加警惕，努力防御，驱除美帝的侵略势力出境。
    美帝恶毒的阴谋之一，是引诱它所认为“民主的个人主义者”来做它侵略的工具。我们是知识分子。我们不否认，在我们一群人中，曾经有过不少自由主义者，有不少曾经接受过旧的民主主义，美国式的民主主义，认为它是进步的主义。不过，随着帝国主义侵略的日益凶暴，以及帝国主义内帮助反动势力而给予中国人民累积的伤害，这些自由主义者，极大部分早已因爱护祖国，而认清旧民主主义的虚伪，以及旧民主主义与帝国主义不可分离的事实。他们觉悟了，他们进步了。随着人民的解放事业的开展，他们归入了人民的队伍。他们决心学习苏联。他们也决心和苏联靠拢在一起。极少数的败类，如胡适之流，甘心作帝国主义的走狗者，早已逃到广州，到台湾，到美国。我们告诉美帝：你们如要找走狗，找工具，你们去找他们去罢！我们准备彻底消灭蒋介石匪帮，蒋介石匪帮的消灭也就是这些败类的消灭。你们去找他们去罢，我们并不禁止你们。
    留在我们队伍中的自由主义者，旧式民主主义者，也就是美帝心目中的“民主个人主义者”，正在减少。艾奇逊在白皮书中张贴了招生广告，正企图引诱这些人入伙。但是我们一定将如林伯渠同志在中国社会科学工作者座谈会上结语所说，“利用白皮书，叫他们也认清美帝国主义，团结在伟大的中国人民革命事业之中。”北平的教职员全体同人们，让我们警惕，让我们团结，团结全体的同人，来揭破美帝国主义的阴谋，来和美帝国主义斗争，不到胜利不止。
