    40,000 Jin Shipped to Tianjin in July
    [Zhangyuan News] The annual production of local medicines and mountain goods in Chahar Province is 30 million jin, accounting for one-fifth of the country's exports. The Provincial Trading Company established a native produce company on Nancaoyuan Street in Zhangyuan, preparing in May and officially opening for business on July 1st. In June and July, a total of more than 130,000 jin of medicinal materials were purchased from Longguan, Yanqing, Chicheng, Xuanhua, Nankou and other places. Except for the more than 30,000 jin purchased in Nankou, which were organized by private merchants to transport and sell in Beiping and Tianjin, the rest were concentrated in Shacheng for sorting, tidying and packaging before being shipped out. As of July 25, a total of over 9,500 jin of processed Paeonia obovata, over 22,000 jin of Scutellaria baicalensis, over 8,800 jin of Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Anemarrhena asphodeloides, and Bupleurum chinense, and over 1,300 jin of Acanthopanax, Manitol, and Saposhnikovia divaricata have been shipped to Tianjin. Calculating only the 40,000 jin shipped to Tianjin, the income is equivalent to about 60,000 jin of millet. Now that the mountain goods harvest season has arrived, the company has sent people to Zhuolu, Changping, Wanping, Laishui, and Yixian through cooperatives to start purchasing sweet and bitter apricot kernels, peach kernels, etc.
