    Soviet and Polish Newspapers Comment on US Warmongering Activities
    US Military Leaders Arming Western Europe is Following Hitler's Old Path
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 8th] According to a Moscow dispatch on the 6th, *Pravda*, in commenting on the activities of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff in Western Europe, stated that the United States will suffer the same consequences for arming Western Europe as it did in China. *Pravda* pointed out: "The conqueror-worshippers of Wall Street in the United States" are making the same mistakes in Western Europe as they once did in China. The people of China once taught the American generals a lesson. *Pravda* stated that Western Europe has people who are unwilling to become "blind tools in the hands of unscrupulous foreign warrior guests." *Pravda* accused the American military leaders of following the same path that Hitler followed, and with "the same foolish self-confidence."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 8th] Polish Press Agency, Warsaw: *People's Tribune* recently published an article titled "Travelers" commenting on the US Joint Chiefs of Staff's trip to Europe, stating: From a military point of view, this trip by the American generals is of little significance. Strategic plans are not made in broad daylight or before the eyes of the public and journalists. The newspaper asked: Then, what are they doing there? Since the visit of these American generals to Western Europe has been so heavily publicized, it can be determined that they must have gone for political reasons. These generals went to the countries of the Marshall Plan to provide Truman with new arguments to defeat the resistance in the Senate of many senators who oppose the weapons program and want to avoid being completely bound by the adventure of arming Europe. *People's Tribune* continued: On the other hand, the American generals are busy trying to finally subdue Western Europe in order to cash in on the interests hidden in the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty; on the other hand, they naively dream that by ostensibly waving the banner of a "strategic" visit, they can scare those Eastern European countries that are peacefully moving towards a socialist future at a time when a cloud of crisis is enveloping Western Europe. The newspaper concluded: In fact, the trip of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff has already made America's allies uneasy, and the agitated tone of the British and French newspapers, and the unhappy expressions on the faces of Western European politicians, are proof of their unease. But the real resistance to the American warmongers comes from the Western working class and democrats.

    苏波报纸评美战贩活动
    美军阀们武装西欧是走希特勒的老路
    【新华社北平八日电】据莫斯科六日讯：真理报在评论美国三军参谋长在西欧的活动时称：美国将因武装西欧而遭受到它在中国所得到的同样结果。真理报指出：“美国华尔街的征服崇拜者”正在西欧犯着错误，如同他们曾在中国犯过的一样。中国的人民曾给美国将军上了一课。真理报称：西欧有着不愿成为“无忌惮的洋客武士手上盲目工具”的人民。真理报责难美国军阀们正走着希特勒所走过的同样的道路，并有着“同样的愚昧自信”。
    【新华社北平八日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：人民论坛报顷以“旅行家”为题评论美国三军参谋长的欧洲之行称：从军事观点看来，美国将军们的这次旅行，并没有多大的意义。战略计划并不是在光天化日之下或当着群众和新闻记者的眼睛制定的。该报问道：那末，他们去干什么呢？由于这几个美国将军去到西欧已被暄染得这样厉害，因此，可以断定，他们一定是为了政治上的原因去的。这几位将军到马歇尔计划各国去，是为了给杜鲁门提供新的论据，好让他在参院中击破许多对武器计划表示反对，以及想避免完全受武装欧洲的冒险计划所约束的参议员的抵抗。人民论坛报继称：另一方面，美国将军们是忙着去使西欧最后地屈服，好把隐藏在马歇尔计划和北大西洋公约中的利益兑现；又一方面，他们天真地梦想表面上打着“战略”访问的招牌，就可以吓唬那些在西欧正笼罩着危机阴云的时候，却和平地向着社会主义前途迈进的东欧国家。该报结语称：实际上，美国三军参谋长的出游，已经使得美国的盟友烦恼不安，英国和法国报章激动的语调，西欧政客们脸上那副闷闷不乐的表情，就是它们烦恼不安的证明。但是真正抵抗美国战争贩子的，还是西方的工人阶级和民主人士。
