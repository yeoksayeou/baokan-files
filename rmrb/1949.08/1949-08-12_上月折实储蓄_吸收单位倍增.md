    Real Value Savings
    Absorption Units Doubled
    [This newspaper reported] The real value savings business handled by the Savings Department of the People's Bank of Beiping Branch and its various agencies saw further development in July. Throughout the month, 5,648 new accounts were opened, absorbing a total of 446,136 real value units, equivalent to 155,525,627.94 yuan in Renminbi. The number of accounts increased by about a quarter compared to June, and the number of units absorbed doubled compared to June (June had 4,485 accounts and 221,964 units). Among them, fixed deposit accounts were the most numerous, accounting for 55 percent of all accounts; followed by installment savings, accounting for slightly over 38 percent; then fixed deposit withdrawal, accounting for 5.1 percent; and deposit with interest being the least, with only one account for the entire month. In terms of the number of units deposited in the above four types of savings, fixed deposit accounts were also the most, accounting for 78.3 percent of the total number of units; followed by fixed deposit withdrawal, accounting for 14.3 percent; installment savings were less, accounting for 7.4 percent; and deposit with interest was the least, with only 47 units. The increase in the number of real value savings accounts and units absorbed in July was mainly due to the favorable response from the outside world after the department revised its savings regulations on July 1st, in addition to the impact of price fluctuations. In particular, the elimination of the limit on the number of units deposited each time for installment savings was seen as a convenience by these savings account holders. In addition, the department vigorously organized deposit work in mid-July, obtaining assistance from the trade unions or administrations of various organizations, factories, and groups, and adding the business of "collecting school fees for various schools and transferring them to real value savings," as well as generally entrusting branch offices of the sub-branches to handle this savings business, all of which were other factors in the department's business development in July.

    上月折实储蓄
    吸收单位倍增
    【本报讯】人民银行北平分行储蓄部及各代办处所办理之折实储蓄业务，七月份益见开展，全月收入新存户五千六百四十八户，共吸收四十四万六千一百三十六个实物单位，折合人民币一亿五千五百二十五万六千零二十七元九角四分。在户数上较六月份增加约四分之一，在吸收单位数上较六月增达一倍（六月份计有四千四百八十五户，二十二万一千九百六十四个单位）。其中以整存整付户头最多，占全部存户百分之五十五；零存整付次之，占百分之三十八强；整存零付又次之，占百分之五点一；以存本付息最少，全月只有一户。在上述四种储蓄存入单位数上亦以整存整付最多，占总单位数百分之七十八点三；其次为整存零付，占百分之十四点三；零存整付较少，占百分之七点四；以存本付息最少，仅有四十七个单位。七月份折实储蓄存户及吸收单位数增加之原因，除受物价波动影响外，主要是由于该部自七月一日修订储蓄章程后，外界反应良好，特别是零存整付每次存入单位数限制之取消，是项储蓄户均感便利。此外该部于七月中大力进行组织存款工作，取得各机关、工厂、团体等职工会或行政上之协助，及增添“代收各学校学费转存折实储蓄”业务，以及普遍委托分行各分支机构代办是项储蓄，均为该部七月份业务开展之另一因素。（宇）
