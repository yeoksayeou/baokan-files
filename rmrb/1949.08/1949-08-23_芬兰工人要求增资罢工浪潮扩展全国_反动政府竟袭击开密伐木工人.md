Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 22nd: Helsinki dispatch: The large-scale strike by Finnish workers demanding increased wages has spread throughout Finland. In the timber industry, one of Finland's most important industries, approximately 4,000 lumber workers in the Kemi region of northern Finland have been on strike for several weeks. Eleven important Finnish trade unions began striking on the 18th, starting with the dockworkers' union. The strike by dockworkers in all 23 ports nationwide has brought shipping to a standstill. Bakers, mill workers, and brewers are also on strike. It is reported that the strike wave is gradually spreading to enterprises in construction, tobacco, automobiles, leather, and rubber industries.

The reactionary Social Democratic government announced on the 18th that it would use "emergency powers" in an attempt to force workers back to work through bloody terror. On the evening of the 18th, striking lumber workers in Kemi were attacked by more than 100 police officers as they were leaving a meeting. The police opened fire on them with pistols and submachine guns, and used tear gas grenades, resulting in the death of one worker and injuries to several others. The police's brutal suppression aroused the indignation of all workers in Kemi. In an emergency meeting, the workers stated that they would not be intimidated by police terror and would continue the struggle until victory. Police terror is becoming increasingly rampant. On the same evening, police arrested people, searched and closed the premises of the local Kemi organization of the Finnish Communist Party, and confiscated documents. The authorities also decided to send troops to Kemi.

Despite the reactionary authorities' brutal suppression, the strike movement is continuing to expand. As of the 19th, it is estimated that 150,000 people had participated in the strike. The Lumber and Log Rafting Workers' Union, with 13,600 members, went on strike on the 19th. The food, plumbing, port, construction, brewing, and baking industries remain shut down.

According to a report by the Finnish democratic newspaper Työkansan Sanomat cited by TASS, the executive committee of the Trade Union Confederation of Kokkola passed a resolution criticizing the right-wing majority of the Finnish Central Trade Union Confederation for betraying the interests of the working class and paying tribute to the workers of Kemi. The movement demanding wage increases is also expanding among members of trade unions led by right-wing Social Democrats. For example, workers at the Lokomo factory in Tampere, one of the largest enterprises in the country (belonging to the metalworkers' union), demanded at a meeting that the Tampere trade union organization immediately review the issue of wage increases.

　　芬兰工人要求增资罢工浪潮扩展全国
    反动政府竟袭击开密伐木工人
    【新华社北平二十二日电】赫尔辛基讯，芬兰工人要求增加工资的大罢工，已在芬兰全国展开。在芬兰最重要工业之一的木材业中，芬兰北部开密地方四千名左右的伐木工人罢工已继续数星期，芬兰十一个重要职工会于十八日起开始罢工，首先是码头工会，全国二十三个港口码头工人的罢工已使船运停顿。面包工人、磨粉工人及酿造工人也都罢工。据悉，罢工浪潮正逐渐扩展到建筑、烟草、汽车、皮革、橡胶等企业中。
    反动的社会民主党政府于十八日宣布使用“紧急权力”，企图用血腥恐怖迫使工人复工。十八日晚，开密伐木业罢工工人集会散会时，遭到一百余名警察的袭击，警察用手枪、冲锋枪向他们开火，并使用催泪瓦斯弹，结果打死工人一名，打伤数名。警察的残酷镇压激起了开密全体工人的愤慨。工人们在紧急会议中称，他们决不为警察的恐怖所吓倒，将继续斗争，直到胜利为止。警察恐怖正越来越猖狂。同日晚间警察捕人，并搜查与封闭芬兰共产党在开密的地方组织房舍，没收文件。当局并决定派遣军队赴开密。
    不顾反动当局的残暴镇压，罢工运动仍在坚持扩大中，迄十九日为止，据估计已有十五万人参加罢工。拥有一万三千六百会员的伐木与漂木工人工会于十九日罢工。食品、水管、港口、建筑、酿造及面包等业继续停顿中。
    据塔斯社引芬兰民主报纸杜坎森·杉诺码报报道：科科拉的职工会联合会执行委员会通过决议，抨击芬兰中央职工联合会的右冀多数派背弃工人阶级利益，并向开密工人致敬。要求增加工资的运动并正在社会民主党右翼分子领导的职工会会员中扩大着。例如全国最大企业之一的坦培累之洛科莫工厂的工人（属于五金工人工会），在会议上要求坦培累的职工会组织立即审议增加工资的问题。
