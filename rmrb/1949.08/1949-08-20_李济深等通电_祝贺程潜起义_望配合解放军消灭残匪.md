  　Congratulating Cheng Qian on His Uprising
  　Hoping He Will Cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to Eliminate the Remaining Bandits
    [Report from this newspaper] After General Cheng Qian's uprising in Changsha, Li Jishen, Tan Pingshan, Cai Tingkai, Chen Qiyuan, Chen Shaoxian, Li Shizhang and others sent a telegram of congratulations. The original text is as follows:
    Brother Cheng Songyun and all uprising officers and soldiers:
    Having read the news and learned of your uprising in Changsha, breaking away from the reactionary clique and joining our people's ranks, this move will further chill the remaining bandits and terrify the tyrant. We are extremely gratified! Jiang贼 (a derogatory term for Chiang Kai-shek) has usurped the Party and betrayed the country for twenty years, with his dictatorial selfishness, warmongering, and slaughter, the devastation of the people is beyond calculation! Thanks to our People's Liberation Army's punitive expeditions and condemnations, after three years of arduous fighting, they are gradually being exterminated. Although they are stubbornly resisting in the southwest, thinking of making a desperate struggle, the victory of the revolution is already set, and the day when the ringleaders are brought to justice is not far away. Your decisive action to abandon sin and take merit is praised by all! We hope that you will continue to work hard, point the magic spear south, cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in combat, and pacify the remaining bandits as soon as possible, to see the success of your efforts. We hereby send a telegram of congratulations, and await your wise consideration. Li Jishen, Tan Pingshan, Cai Tingkai, Chen Qiyuan, Chen Shaoxian, Li Shizhang
