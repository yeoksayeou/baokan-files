To Facilitate Transport and Sales of Local Specialties
Shanghai Plans to Establish Native Produce Company

[Shanghai News] In order to encourage material exchange with various liberated areas, the Shanghai Trade Corporation is planning to establish the "Shanghai Native Produce Company" soon.

Currently, in addition to being responsible for supplying the city with major staple foods such as rice, beans, and oil, the Trade Corporation also manages the transport and sales of rural by-products. The task of establishing a specialized native produce company is to specifically manage the exchange, transport, and sales of the vast rural local specialties. Among the goods successively transported from various regions, there are porcelain from Jingdezhen, Gan Northeast, and on the way are small jujubes from Leling, Shandong, honeysuckle and fruits and vegetables from Yanzhou. Local specialties such as medicinal materials and tobacco leaves from Shandong and Hubei, kelp from Shandong, and Longkou vermicelli are all daily necessities for people's livelihoods.

[Another Dispatch] A batch of Jiangxi specialty Jingdezhen porcelain, consigned by the Gan Northeast Trade Corporation to the Shanghai Trade Corporation for sale, has been delivered to the port. After the Trade Corporation received the porcelain, it handed it over to the Daily Necessities Retail Department, and sales began on the 1st of this month. In principle, the proceeds from the sale of this batch of porcelain will be used to purchase and transport daily necessities back to Jiangxi. According to the Trade Corporation, the number of local specialties being transported to Shanghai for sale is likely to increase gradually in the future.

    便利各地特产运销
    沪计划设土产公司
    【上海讯】上海贸易总公司为了鼓励各解放区物资交流，现正计划在最近设立“上海市土产公司”。
    现贸总除负责供应本市米，豆，油等民生主要食品外，兼管农村副产品之运销。设立土产专业公司之任务，是专管广大农村特产的交流运销。自各地区络续运来的，已有赣东北景德镇的瓷器，在途中的有山东乐陵小枣，兖州金银花及水果菜。各地的特产如山东，湖北的药材，烟叶，山东的胶菜，龙口细粉等，都是日常民生必需的东西。
    【又讯】赣东北贸总运交本市贸总委托出售的江西特产景德镇瓷器一批，自装运到埠后，贸总即将前项瓷器交给日用品门市部，于本月一日开始发售。这批瓷器所得价款，原则上将购运日用品装返江西。据贸总方面表示，各地特产装来上海出售的事情，今后可能日渐增多。
