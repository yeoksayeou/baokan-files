Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 6th: Warsaw Dispatch: Poland and Czechoslovakia recently signed a navigation agreement in Prague, providing Czechoslovakia, located in the center of Europe and without seaports on its territory, with convenient access to the sea. This is one of the examples of economic mutual assistance and cooperation between people's democratic countries. The Polish-Czech navigation agreement stipulates that the Hel Peninsula region of Poland will be leased to Czechoslovakia for a period of eighty years, and the terms of the agreement will be revised every ten years. The leased area, including all its buildings and equipment, will be called the Czechoslovakian zone in the Zdzieszowice Port Free Zone. The Czech Republic can build its own docks, stacks, railways, water, electricity, and telephone networks in the area, and employ Czechoslovakian and other nationalities with the consent of the Polish authorities. Currently, the construction of the new Czechoslovakian wharf in the area is underway and will be completed soon.

The Polish "Republic" newspaper commented on the agreement, saying: The strengthened cooperation between Poland and Czechoslovakia in navigation is one of the best examples of the new economic relations in Central and Eastern Europe. In contrast to the capitalist principles used by the reactionary Polish authorities and Germans before the war to deal with the Czechoslovak economy for many years, the Polish People's Democratic Government has no intention of using its coast and ports as tools to exploit or discriminate against Czechoslovak navigation. The fundamental intention of People's Poland is to enable Czechoslovakia to participate in navigation activities, mainly through joint investment with Poland in the construction and use of seaport facilities.

    人民国家经济互助范例
    波捷签订航海协定
    使无海口的捷克斯洛伐克获得了便利的通海口
    【新华社北平六日电】华沙讯：波兰与捷克斯洛伐克最近在布拉格签订了航海协定，使位于欧洲中心、领土上没有海港的捷克斯洛伐克获得了便利的通海口。这是人民民主国家之间在经济上互助合作的范例之一。波捷航海协定规定：波兰耶瓦半岛地区，以八十年为期租借给捷克斯洛伐克，并规定协定条款每十年修订一次。租用地区连同其一切建筑物与设备在内，将被称为兹杰辛港自由区中的捷克斯洛伐克区。捷国可在该区建筑自己的码头、堆栈、铁路、水电及电话网，并在波兰当局同意下，雇用捷克斯洛伐克及其他国籍的人员。现该区捷克斯洛伐克新码头工程已在建筑中，不久即可竣工。
    波兰共和报评该协定说：波捷航海上的加强合作，乃是中、东欧新经济关系的最好例证之一。与战前波兰反动当局与德国人多年来用以对付捷克斯洛伐克经济的资本主义原则相反，波兰人民民主政府无意于利用自己的海岸和港口，作为剥削或歧视捷克斯洛伐克航业的工具。人民波兰的根本意图，乃是主要地通过在建筑与使用海港设备上与波兰联合投资，使捷克斯洛伐克参加航业活动。
