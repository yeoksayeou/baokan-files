    Automatic Reporting Reduces Tax Rates, Collects Overdue Fees, and Strictly Punishes Evasion
    Shanghai Municipal People's Government Announces Business Tax Collection Measures
    [Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station, 13th Broadcast] Shanghai News: The "Provisional Measures for the Collection of Business Tax in Shanghai Municipality" have been promulgated and implemented by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government. The tax rates in these measures are lighter than those under the Kuomintang. They will be implemented starting from June. In terms of legislative spirit and specific content, these measures have the following differences and advantages compared to the tax laws of the Kuomintang reactionaries: (1) Trust taxpayers and create an automatic reporting system. (2) Reduce tax rates and differentiate tax rates for industry and commerce. The tax rates for basic industries, export industries, and transportation industries are the lowest, only 0.5%; the tax rate for general industry is also only 1%; while among commercial sectors, the tax rates for non-essential goods are the highest. (3) Collect overdue fees and severely punish evasion and false accounting. Those who deliberately delay payment will be charged overdue fees, ranging from 15% to twice the amount due. Any false or concealed reporting and setting up of false accounts, once verified, will be subject to a fine of 30 to 50 times the amount of tax evaded by the court.
