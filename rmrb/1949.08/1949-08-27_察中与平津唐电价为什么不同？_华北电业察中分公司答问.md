　　Why are Electricity Prices Different in Chahar Central and Tianjin-Beijing-Tangshan?
   Answer from the North China Electric Power Chahar Central Branch to Mr. Li Gang:

    Regarding your inquiry about electricity prices in Chahar Central, the North China Electric Power Chahar Central Branch answers as follows:

    (1) Because Tianjin, Beijing, and Tangshan have a power grid, they can mutually adjust and calculate costs uniformly, so the electricity prices are the same. The Chahar Central Huayuan Power Plant has a 10,000-kilowatt generator. The remaining electricity, after the portion sold, cannot be transported to Tianjin, Beijing, and Tangshan for utilization, which increases costs intangibly. Therefore, it is difficult to make the electricity prices the same as those in the Tianjin, Beijing, and Tangshan areas, where power grids allow for mutual adjustment. (2) As for the statement that electricity prices in Chahar Central are too high, this probably refers to the early days of liberation. This branch used to start reading meters on the 15th of each month and could not finish reading them until the 16th of the following month. Electricity fees were received at the end of the following month or the beginning of the third month, which is slightly different from the practice in Tianjin and Beijing, where electricity fees are collected in the same month. (3) Since its reorganization, this branch has revised electricity prices from July, reducing charges. Metered electricity is 105 yuan per kilowatt-hour. At the beginning of the month, the price of millet was 38 yuan per jin, 45 yuan per jin in the middle of the month, and 80 yuan per jin at the end of the month. In August, metered electricity prices were 230 yuan per kilowatt-hour, while the price of rice at the beginning of the month was 120 yuan. These are equivalent to less than three and a half jin of rice, which is a significant reduction. (4) Currently, state-owned enterprises must at least be self-sufficient. Therefore, the cost must be considered when determining electricity prices to avoid excessive losses. (Business Department of North China Electric Power Company)

### 察中与平津唐电价为什么不同？　华北电业察中分公司答问

　　察中与平津唐电价为什么不同？
  　华北电业察中分公司答问李冈先生：
    你所询问关于察中电价问题经华北电业公司察中分公司解答如下：
    （一）平津唐三地因有电力网，能够互相调剂，可以统一计算成本，故电价相同。察中下花园发电厂为一万千瓦之发电机，除售出部分外，余数不能输送平津唐各地利用，成本无形增高，与平津唐有电力网互相调剂地区之电价实难一律。（二）至所称察中电价太高，谅系在解放初期而言，查本分公司在六月份以前为每月十五日开始抄表，下月十六日以前始能抄竣，收到电费已在下月月底或第三月月初，与平津各地当月电费当月收回，稍有不同。（三）本分公司改组后，自七月份起业已修正电价，降低收费。表灯每度一○五元，在月初小米价每斤三十八元，月中每斤四十五元，月底每斤八十元。八月份表灯电价每度二三○元，在月初米价一二○元，已均折合不到三斤半米价，实际降减甚多。（四）现公营企业，最低亦须自给自足，故决定电价时必须顾到成本，免使亏累过巨。（华北电业公司业务处）
