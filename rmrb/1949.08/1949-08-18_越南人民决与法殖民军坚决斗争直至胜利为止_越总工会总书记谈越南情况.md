Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th. According to TASS, Paris, Lu Dubo (transliteration), Secretary-General of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, who participated in the Second World Congress of Trade Union Representatives, said to a reporter from the French newspaper "Liberation" stationed in Belgium on his way back to his country, emphasizing that the Vietnamese people are determined to continue fighting the French colonial army until victory. Speaking about the war in northern Vietnam, Lu said: Northern Vietnam has rich strategic mineral deposits, and the United States is coveting it. "The imperialists are sending expeditionary forces to die for the profits that the imperialists hope to obtain." Lu described the economic situation in the Vietnamese liberated areas, saying: We have many small enterprises that manufacture various goods, most of which are cooperatives. They mainly manufacture weapons - hand grenades, Tommy guns, anti-tank guns, and grenade launchers. We even have small blast furnaces. These enterprises have been renovated by the government. The real wages of workers in the liberated areas are about five times higher than in the occupied areas, while the cost of living is lower. We have enough food and necessities.

    越总工会总书记谈越南情况
    【新华社北平十七日电】据塔斯社巴黎讯，参加第二届世界职工代表大会的越南总工会总书记卢杜波（译音），在返国途中道经比利时时，向法国解放报驻比记者发表谈话，强调指出：越南人民决与法国殖民军继续斗争，直到胜利为止，卢氏在谈到越南北部的战争时说：越南北部拥有丰富的战略矿藏，美国对此垂涎欲滴。“帝国主义者正在派出远征军，去为帝国主义者所希望取得的利润而送死”。卢氏叙述越南解放区的经济情况说：我们拥有制造着各种货物的许多小企业，这种小企业大多是合作社。它们主要制造武器——手榴弹、汤姆枪、反坦克枪和掷弹筒。我们甚至还拥有小型的鼓风炉。这些企业已经由政府加以重修。解放区职工的实际工资比占领区约高五倍。而生活费用却较低。我们拥有足够的食粮和必需品。
