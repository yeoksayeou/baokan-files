Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 11th—The streamlining and thrift campaign called for by the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has been gradually launched in the organs of the Provisional People's Government of Central Plains, Wuhan City, and the organs, enterprises, schools, and organizations of Hubei and Henan provinces. The Finance Department, Public Enterprises Department, Central China Branch of the People's Bank of China, Preparatory Committee of the Central China Federation of Trade Unions, and Zhongyuan University of the Provisional People's Government of Central Plains have separately conducted thorough account clearing, waste inspections, and the formulation of specific measures for streamlining and thrift. The Wuhan Municipal Government and its affiliated organs have streamlined personnel three times. The General Office of the Municipal Government has been reduced from more than 440 people before the takeover to 108 people. Due to the strengthening of ideological education for staff, work efficiency has not decreased. The Wuchang and Hanyang branches of the People's Bank of China are also clearing accounts and inspecting waste. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the CPC, the Hubei Provincial People's Government, and the directly affiliated organs of the Hubei Military Region are inspecting the cadres' hedonistic thinking and extravagance, and implementing streamlining. All directly affiliated units of the Provincial Government have uniformly stopped using electric stoves, and water consumption has been reduced by one-third compared to the past. The Hubei Provincial Post Office has streamlined 465 employees, who have been introduced to schools for study. The bureau has also stopped the use of two cars and one steamer for transporting office personnel, which can save 375 gallons of gasoline per month. Renting out the steamer can also generate income of 60 shi of rice. The Hubei branch of Xinhua News Agency has also been reduced from more than 70 people to more than 50 people. All party, government, and military organs in Henan Province have been practicing strict economy. All personnel under the supply system have been saving two liang of grain per person per day since August. The budgets of various organs have been reduced. The budget of the Kaifeng Xinhua Bookstore in August was reduced by one-quarter compared to the past. All public and joint public-private factories in Zhengzhou have decided to implement strict cost accounting to curb waste of capital in production. The Henan Military and Political Cadre School is also engaged in spare-time production, reclaiming wasteland and planting vegetables. Due to the partial self-sufficiency of vegetables, the school can now save four liang of grain per person per day.
