    Supplying Grain and Fuel to Beijing and Shanghai
    Hefei Shipping is Smooth
    Trading Company Sends 200 Large Ships to Beijing and Shanghai!
    [Report from this newspaper in Hefei] The city's Ship Management Branch, having organized over two hundred large and small ships, is continuing to work hard to supply the newly liberated cities in the south with industrial production materials and daily necessities for the people after completing the glorious task of ferrying the army across the river. To date, it has transported 150,000 tons of coal and native products from northern Anhui such as rice, wheat, oil, tea, and hemp to the Beijing and Shanghai areas, exchanging them for materials such as gasoline, foreign yarn, and foreign cloth. It has also carried merchants and passengers directly to Hangzhou and Wuhan. The wages and freight rates for the ships are determined based on the load and distance. The freight rate to Nanjing, which is 480 li away, is 6%, and to Shanghai, which is 1,300 li away, is 4%. For every 100 jin transported per li downstream, the wage is 1.9 liang of rice, and 2 liang upstream. We are undertaking the transport of 40,000 tons of coal for the Nanjing China Merchants Bureau, which is being contracted out to small boat owners. The 500 tons of wheat for disaster relief from the Northern Anhui Administrative Office has been transported to the Anqing District. The Hefei Trading Company's 200 large ships, with a load capacity of 20 to 60 tons each, have also been arranged by the branch office and have been loaded with oil for Beijing and Shanghai. When the autumn harvest comes, four large ships will be purchased to expand transportation.
