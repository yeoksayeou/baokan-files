    Real Estate Ownership Certificates to be Issued Starting the 15th
    [This City News] The Municipal Land Administration Bureau has decided to begin issuing real estate ownership certificates on the 15th of this month. Anyone who applied for real estate registration with the bureau more than 40 days ago, whose property rights have been reviewed and confirmed by the bureau as legitimate, and for whom the public announcement period has expired without any objections, may go to the bureau to pay the fees and collect their real estate ownership certificate.
