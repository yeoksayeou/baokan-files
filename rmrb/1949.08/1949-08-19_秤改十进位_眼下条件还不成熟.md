　　Changing the Catty to a Decimal System
  　Conditions Are Not Yet Mature
    To the Editor:
    Most weights and measures are decimal, which makes calculations very simple. But our catty (斤) system? It happens to be hexadecimal (sixteen-based), which is not only troublesome to calculate, but even elementary school students have to learn dead methods like "finding liang within a catty" and "finding catty within liang," which is quite brain-consuming. And there's also a feudal legend that the origin of sixteen liang is related to the "Six Stars of the Southern Dipper, the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, and the Three Stars of Fortune, Prosperity, and Longevity." For the convenience of calculation and to break feudal legends, we should change it to ten liang per catty. I wonder if the government can uniformly reform it now?　　　Li Jing

    Comrade Li Jing:
    Regarding your question about reforming the Chinese catty, we received the following reply from the Finance Department of the North China People's Government: "The suggestion to change the sixteen-liang catty to a ten-liang catty is very good. Whether from a scientific point of view, computational convenience, or unifying weights and measures, changing to a decimal system is good. We have also studied it in the past. However, considering the habits of the masses and objective conditions, we cannot reform it for the time being, lest the reform be incomplete and cause new confusion. From a development perspective, when the conditions are met, we can study a unified method. Currently, the Jidong District calculates based on the decimal system. We are preparing to gain experience from the implementation in that district and then make unified regulations." — Editor

### 秤改十进位　眼下条件还不成熟

　　秤改十进位
  　眼下条件还不成熟编辑同志：
    一般的度量衡大都是十进位，在计算方面十分简便。而我们的秤呢？偏偏是十六进位，不但计算时麻烦，就是小学生们学一套什么“斤内求两”“两内求斤”的死法子，也相当费脑子，并且又有一种封建传说，说十六两的来历是什么“南斗六星、北斗七星、福禄寿三星”。我们为了计算方便，为了破除封建传说，应当把它改成十两一斤。不知现在是不是可以由政府统一改革一下？　　　李晶李晶同志：
    你所提的关于改革中国秤的问题，承华北人民政府财政部答复如下：“改十六两秤为十两秤的建议很好，无论从科学道理、计算便利与统一度量衡方面来说，改为十进位都是好的，我们过去也曾作过研究；但因考虑到群众习惯与客观条件，暂时尚不能改革，以免改不彻底反而引起新的紊乱。从发展上说，条件具备时，即可研究统一的办法。目前冀东区即是按十进位算的，我们准备从该区的执行中取得经验，然后再作统一规定。”—编者
