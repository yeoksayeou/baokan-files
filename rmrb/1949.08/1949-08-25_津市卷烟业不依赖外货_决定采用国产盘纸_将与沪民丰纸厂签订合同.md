　　Tianjin Cigarette Industry No Longer Relies on Foreign Goods
    Decides to Use Domestically Produced Paper Rolls
  　Contract to be Signed with Shanghai Minfeng Paper Mill
    [Tianjin News] The Tianjin cigarette industry has decided to use domestically produced paper rolls and no longer rely on foreign goods. All 26 state-owned and private cigarette factories in the city (excluding Yizhong Tobacco Company) plan to sign a contract with Shanghai Minfeng Paper Mill, the only manufacturer of paper rolls in China. The contract has been drafted by the cigarette industry, and once the paper mill agrees and each cigarette factory approves it through discussion, it will take effect upon signing. The main contents of the contract are as follows: (1) When the price of paper rolls from Minfeng Paper Mill is equal to or lower than the market price, each cigarette factory guarantees not to use paper rolls from the market (all paper rolls in the market are foreign goods); (2) Minfeng Paper Mill guarantees to supply each factory's needs on schedule, and the price is based on cost plus transportation expenses. The Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce strongly supports this matter and has sent a letter to the Foreign Trade Administration requesting that it stop importing paper rolls in the future, and has also sent a letter to the Railway Bureau requesting it to facilitate the transportation of paper rolls from Minfeng Paper Mill. It is understood that the paper rolls used by the Tianjin cigarette industry mostly come from countries such as the United States and France. The only domestic factory that manufactures paper rolls is Shanghai Minfeng Paper Mill. The Andong Paper Mill in Northeast China has stopped production due to the air permeability of its paper rolls. After the liberation of Shanghai, the paper mill established an office in Tianjin and contacted cigarette factories in North China. According to the person in charge of the office, the monthly demand for paper rolls in Northeast, Northwest, Shandong, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places is approximately 140,000 rolls, which the paper mill's production capacity can fully supply. The mill's "Feng Peng Chuan" brand paper rolls were recently shipped to Tianjin in a batch of 500 rolls. The quality is no lower than that of foreign paper rolls, and the price is low. Calculated at 40 rolls per box, each box costs about 900,000 yuan, while paper rolls on the market sell for more than 1 million yuan per box.

　　津市卷烟业不依赖外货
    决定采用国产盘纸
  　将与沪民丰纸厂签订合同
    【天津讯】本市卷烟业决定采用国产盘纸，不再依赖外货。全市国、私营烟厂共二十六家（颐中烟草公司除外），拟与我国唯一制造盘纸的上海民丰纸厂订立合同。合同已由卷烟业拟出，一俟该厂同意，各烟厂讨论通过后，即签字生效。合同主要内容有二：（一）民丰厂盘纸价格和市价相等或低于市价时，各烟厂保证不用市上盘纸（市上所存盘纸均外国货）；（二）民丰纸厂保证按期供给各厂需要，价格系按成本加运输费用。本市工商局对此事颇为赞助，已函请对外贸易管理局今后停止盘纸进口，并函请铁路局对民丰纸厂盘纸的运输，予以便利。按本市卷烟业所用盘纸，多来自美、法等国，国内制造盘纸的工厂，仅有上海民丰纸厂一家，东北之安东造纸厂，已因所产盘纸透气而停工。上海解放后，该厂在津设立办事处，和华北各烟厂取得联系，据该处负责人称：东北、西北、山东、天津、上海等地，月约需盘纸十四万盘，该厂产量足能供给，该厂所出风篷船牌盘纸，已于日前运津五百盘，质量并不低于外国盘纸，且价格低廉。按四十盘一箱计算，每箱约合九十万元，市上盘纸则一箱卖到一百万元以上。
