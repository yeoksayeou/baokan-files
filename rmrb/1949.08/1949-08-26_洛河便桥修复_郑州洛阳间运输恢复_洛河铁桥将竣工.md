　　Luo River Pontoon Bridge Repaired
　　Transportation Between Zhengzhou and Luoyang Resumes
　　Luo River Railway Bridge to be Completed
　　[This newspaper's report] The Luo River pontoon bridge on the western section of the Longhai Railway was repaired on August 7th. The destruction of this bridge by floods on July 7th greatly impacted transportation between Zhengzhou and Luoyang, as well as the military transport to support the Northwest Front. After the Railway Corps' 3rd detachment, which was rushing to repair the Huaihe River Bridge, began working day and night from July 27th to August 7th, they finally erected a 243-meter-long pontoon bridge over the Luo River, known as the "bottomless river" with its constantly shifting sands, ensuring smooth railway traffic between Zhengzhou and Luoyang.
　　[Another News] The Luo River Railway Bridge (the third largest bridge on the entire Longhai Railway line), which was being constructed simultaneously with the Luo River pontoon bridge, is also nearing completion, consisting of seven spans and measuring 318 meters in length. It should be noted that the steel beams of this bridge were dismantled and transported away by the Kuomintang in September of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939) to prevent the Japanese army from advancing westward, and the bridge piers were blown up, and it had never been repaired. After liberation, in order to avoid the annual destruction of the pontoon bridge by floods, a permanent steel bridge repair project was initiated, and now 80 percent of the entire project has been completed.

### 洛河便桥修复　郑州洛阳间运输恢复　洛河铁桥将竣工

　　洛河便桥修复
  　郑州洛阳间运输恢复
  　洛河铁桥将竣工
    【本报讯】陇海路西段洛河便桥已于八月七日修复。该桥自七月七日被洪水冲毁后，对于郑州与洛阳之间交通及支援西北前线军运影响极大。经抢修淮河大桥的铁道兵团第三支队于七月二十七日开始至八月七日十天中日以继夜的工作，终于在号称“无底河”的全部流沙河底的洛河上架起长达二百四十三公尺的便桥，保证了郑州洛阳间铁路畅通。
    【又讯】与洛河便桥同时进行修建的洛河铁桥（为陇海路全线第三位大桥）亦将竣工，计七孔，长三百十八公尺。按，自民国二十八年九月，国民党为防止日军西进，将该桥钢梁拆卸运走，桥墩炸毁后，一直未曾修复。解放后，为免除便桥每年被水冲毁，即进行永久性铁桥的修复工程，现已完成全部工程的百分之八十。
