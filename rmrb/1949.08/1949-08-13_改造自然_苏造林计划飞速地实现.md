    Transforming Nature
    The Soviet Afforestation Plan Rapidly Achieved
    (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th) TASS Moscow: The Soviet Union's plan for afforestation to transform nature in the steppe and forest-steppe zones, as well as the plan for developing livestock breeding, are being rapidly implemented. The afforestation plan stipulates the establishment of fifty forest administrations and two hundred forest districts within the next two years. However, in the first half of this year, the plan has already been nearing completion, with forty-one forest administrations and one hundred and sixty-five forest districts already established. Construction of offices, apartments, and other buildings for the administrations is now actively underway in various regions. Most administrations are located in treeless steppe areas, and within a few years, millions of hectares of land in these areas will be sheltered by forests, protected from drought and wind damage. Each administration will manage fifteen thousand to thirty thousand hectares of forest. In addition to carrying out extensive organizational work, the forest administrations have already begun to implement their main tasks. They have already planted saplings in the spring, and these nurseries will cultivate twenty-five million seedlings, sufficient for planting two thousand five hundred hectares of forest. The forest administrations are currently preparing the soil necessary for nurseries and tree planting in state-owned forest areas, and are storing tree seeds.
    The Soviet Union's three-year plan for developing livestock breeding is also being rapidly implemented. The plan calls for a doubling of livestock numbers within three years. Advanced collective farms and state farms in Belarus have pledged to complete the three-year plan in two years. This patriotic initiative is eliciting enthusiastic responses from other state and collective farms. Livestock farming in Belarusian collective and state farms has reached pre-war levels, with livestock numbers tripling since 1945. Forty thousand livestock breeding groups have been restored, and more than seven hundred new livestock breeding groups have been established. Collective farms and state farms have established a reliable feed base, are now building new livestock sheds, and are mechanizing various labor-intensive tasks involved in raising livestock.

    改造自然
    苏造林计划飞速地实现
    【新华社北平十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联在草原与森林草原地带造林改造自然的计划，以及发展牲畜饲养的计划，正在飞速实现中。造林计划规定今明两年内建立五十个森林管理局和两百个森林区。但在今年上半年，该计划即已接近完成，已建立了四十一个森林管理局和一六五个森林区。现在各地正在积极建筑管理局的办公室。公寓及其他建筑。大多数管理局都设在没有森林的草原地带，几年之内，这些地带的几百万公顷的土地，都将受到森林的掩护，可免旱灾和风灾。每一管理局将管理一万五千公顷到三万公顷的森林。森林管理局除进行广泛的组织工作之外，并已开始执行它的主要任务。它们已在春季种植了树苗，这些苗圃将培植出二千五百万株苗木，可供种植二千五百公顷的森林。森林管理局现正准备苗圃和国有森林区植树所必需的土壤，并储存树种。
    苏联发展牲畜饲养的三年计划，也正在迅速实现。计划要求在三年内牲畜头数增加一倍半。白俄罗斯先进的集体农场和国营农场已保证两年内完成三年计划。这一爱国的创举正引起其他国营农场和集体农场的热烈响应。白俄罗斯集体农场与国营农场的牲畜业已达到战前水平，牲畜头数比一九四五年增加了三倍，已经恢复了四万个牲畜饲养组，并建立了七百多个新的牲畜饲养组。集体农场和国营农场已建立了可靠的饲养基地，现正建造新的家畜棚，并使饲养牲畜的各种费力的劳动机械化。
