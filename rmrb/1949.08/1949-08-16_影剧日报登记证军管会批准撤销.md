　　[This City News] The Beiping Municipal People's Government News Office submitted to the Military Control Commission for approval the revocation of the "Movie and Drama Daily" registration certificate. This is because since the newspaper began publication in early May, its content has been empty and its writing clumsy. After six issues, it lost sales and ceased publication on its own. However, a few days later, the newspaper's organizer, Chen Yifei, without applying for registration procedures, arbitrarily used the "Movie and Drama Daily" registration certificate to publish a "Movie and Drama Daily Supplement" (weekly) and in the inaugural speech, indiscriminately slandered various newspapers in this city.

　　影剧日报登记证军管会批准撤销
    【本市讯】北平市人民政府新闻处呈奉军管会批准，撤销“影剧日报”登记证。因该报自五月上旬出版以来，由于内容空洞，文字拙劣，出了六期便丧失销路而自行停刊。但几天之后，该报主办人陈逸飞，未经申请登记手续，竟擅自套用“影剧日报”登记证，另出“影剧日报增刊”（周刊），并在发刊词中对本市各报滥肆诽谤。
