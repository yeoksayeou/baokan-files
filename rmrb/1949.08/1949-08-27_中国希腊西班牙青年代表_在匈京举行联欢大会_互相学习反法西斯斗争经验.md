Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 26th: Budapest News: The Chinese Youth Delegation held another gathering with representatives of Free Greece and Spanish youth on the 23rd. Eighty fully armed male and female youth representatives from Free Greece and over thirty Greek children, as well as twenty Spanish representatives, were invited. Each time guests arrived, there was a burst of warm handshakes, embraces, and cheers conveying a common will in different languages. As soon as the Greek children got out of the car, they shouted "Long live Mao Zedong!" in Chinese! This shows how familiar and loving the people's leader Mao Zedong is, even to the youngest generation in Greece who are struggling bitterly.

After the guests arrived, they first introduced themselves briefly. When several Chinese and Greek combat heroes were introduced, everyone lifted them high and cheered to pay their respects. Then, Xiao Hua, the deputy head of the Chinese delegation, spoke, briefly describing the great victory of the Chinese Liberation War and the role of Chinese youth in the battles. This was followed by an introduction from the head of the Greek delegation, Farakos, about the heroic struggles of the Greek people and youth over the years to crush the three offensives of the US-British interventionists and the Greek fascist government forces. He said: The Greek People's Guerrilla has developed into a strong regular army in the battles, and the Greek people will finally defeat the imperialist robbers and their lackeys in Greece. At this point, the whole audience responded with enthusiastic cheers.

		Chairman Mao's Revolutionary War Theory Works Widely Studied by Greek Democratic Army
Next, he said: Comrade Mao Zedong's theoretical works on revolutionary war have become materials widely studied in the Greek Democratic Army. He also said: I cannot describe in words the Greek youth's ardent desire to learn from the Chinese youth's struggle experience, nor can I depict how China's victory has inspired and educated the Greek people and youth. The head of the Spanish delegation, Ariaga, spoke last. He said: Although the Franco government, supported by imperialism, has imprisoned nearly 200,000 people's fighters, it has not made the Spanish people submit. Our people have developed a strong guerrilla force of more than 50,000 people in the Aragon region. They must learn from the examples of the Chinese and Greek people, persevere in the struggle, and fight until the final victory.

Greek and Spanish representatives presented flowers to the Chinese delegation successively, and the Chinese delegation sang the song "Defend Madrid" to thank them for their kindness. The gathering lasted from 9:30 in the morning until 2:00 in the afternoon. At the end of the meeting, there was another burst of enthusiastic applause, handshakes, embraces, cheers, and singing. Finally, the Chinese delegation sent off these heroic friends who are fighting on the Grammos Mountains and the Pindus Mountains with the majestic song of "Unity is Strength."

　　中国希腊西班牙青年代表
  　在匈京举行联欢大会
    互相学习反法西斯斗争经验
    【新华社布拉格二十六日电】布达佩斯讯：中国青年代表团二十三日又举行了与自由希腊和西班牙青年代表的聚会。应邀而来的贵宾，有八十位全副武装的自由希腊男女青年代表和三十多个希腊小朋友，还有二十位西班牙代表。每一次客人来到时，都是一阵热烈的握手、拥抱和用不同的言语传达出共同意志的欢呼。希腊小朋友们一下车，就用中国话高呼“毛泽东万岁”！这表示正在苦斗中的希腊人民，连最年轻的一代也多么熟悉和热爱着中国人民领袖毛泽东。
    客人到齐后，彼此首先来了一个简单的介绍。当介绍到中国的和希腊的几位战斗英雄时，大家就把他们高高地举起来，并向他们欢呼致敬。接着由中国代表团副团长萧华同志讲话，他略述了中国解放战争的伟大胜利，和中国青年在战斗中的作用。继由希腊代表团团长法拉克斯介绍希腊人民和青年几年来粉碎美英干涉者和希腊法西斯政府军三次围攻的英勇斗争。他说：希腊人民游击队已在战斗中发展成为壮大的正规军，希腊人民将最后战胜帝国主义强盗及其在希腊的鹰犬。这时，全场报以热烈的欢呼。
    　　　　毛主席革命战争理论著作　希民主军普遍学习
    接着，他说：毛泽东同志关于革命战争的理论著作，已成为希腊民主军中普遍学习的材料。他又说：我无法用言词形容希腊青年要求学习中国青年斗争经验的热望，也无法描绘中国的胜利是怎样鼓舞了和教育了希腊的人民和青年。西班牙代表团团长阿里阿加最后讲话。他说：帝国主义支持下的佛朗哥政府虽然监禁了将近二十万的人民斗士，但并没有使西班牙人民屈服，我国人民已经在阿拉贡地区发展了五万多人的坚强的游击队，他们一定要学中国人民和希腊人民的榜样，坚持斗争，直到最后胜利。
    希腊、西班牙代表先后向中国代表团献花，中国代表团唱了“保卫马德里”的歌曲，来答谢他们的盛情。这个聚会从上午九点半一直进行到下午两点，散会时又是一阵热情的鼓掌、握手、拥抱、欢呼和歌唱。最后，中国代表团用“团结就是力量”的雄壮的歌声送走了这些英勇地战斗在格拉姆斯山和比牛利斯山的朋友们。
