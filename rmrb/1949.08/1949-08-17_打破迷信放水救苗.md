　　Breaking Superstition to Release Water and Save Seedlings
    [Reported by this newspaper] In previous years when the water was high in Qinghe Town, District Seventeen, the local farmers would throw whole pigs and sheep into the river, fearing that the "Dragon King" would be angered and destroy the entire town. In the twenty-eighth year of the Republic, they threw in two pigs, three sheep, and many steamed buns. This year, however, with the village as the unit and the street leaders taking the lead, they inspected low-lying areas day and night, releasing water wherever there was flooding. They mobilized more than 280 laborers to dig 170 large and small drainage ditches, saving more than 1,300 mu of land. (Yuan Yueyun)

　　打破迷信放水救苗
    【本报讯】十七区清河镇往年水大时，该地农民就向河里投整猪整羊，深怕“龙王爷”发怒，将全镇都给毁了。二十八年就投下过两只猪三只羊和许多馒头。今年大水时却以闾为单位，街长带头，日夜检查低地，有水就放，动员了二百八十多个民工，挑成放水沟大大小小有一百七十多条，救出地一千三百余亩。（袁岳云）
