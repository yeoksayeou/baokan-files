[Shenyang People's Radio, 26th Broadcast] In order to develop inter-liberated area trade in a planned way and to mutually regulate surpluses and shortages, the Northeast Export Company recently consulted with the Jiaodong Trade General Company of the East China Liberated Area on a barter agreement between the two regions. Beginning in late August, the Jiaodong Trade General Company will ship 90,000 bolts of cloth produced in Qingdao to the Northeast each month. The Northeast will also supply Jiaodong with 15,000 tons of surplus grain, 2,000 cubic meters of timber, 500 tons of soybean oil, 150 tons of kerosene, 200 tons of white sugar, and glue and other materials. The two sides are currently in Qingdao and Shenyang negotiating the detailed content of the contract, and it can be formally signed in the near future. In order to immediately resolve the needs of the two regions, barter between the two regions has already begun before the formal signing of the contract.
