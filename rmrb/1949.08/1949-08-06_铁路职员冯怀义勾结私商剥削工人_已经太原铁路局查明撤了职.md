    Railway Clerk Feng Huaiyi Colludes with Private Merchants to Exploit Workers;
    Dismissed After Investigation by Taiyuan Railway Bureau
    [Our Newspaper News] This newspaper published a news item on page one on March 1st, "Railway Bureau Employee Feng Huaiyi Colludes with Private Merchants in Speculation and Profiteering." The Taiyuan Railway Bureau has conducted an in-depth investigation. The facts are as follows: Comrade Zhang, a purchasing agent for the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, contracted with Ding Weishi, the manager of a private iron furnace, for 800 picks, at a real price of 38 jin of millet per pick. After Ding Weishi took the contract, Feng Huaiyi sub-contracted 150 picks to the workers of the Yangquan Kutie Plant for worker's spare-time production, at 30 jin of millet per pick. It is understood that when Feng Huaiyi contracted from Ding Weishi, Ding Weishi drew up two contracts for him, one at 35 jin of millet per pick and the other at 30 jin of millet per pick (these two contracts have been retained by the Yangquan First District Trade Union). The contract discussed with the workers was the one for 30 jin per pick. The difference for the 150 picks totaled 750 jin of millet. The Yangquan Trade Union found out about this matter and investigated, forcing Feng to admit the facts. When paying the workers, the price was calculated at 35 jin of millet per pick. Although Feng Huaiyi admitted his mistake at the time, he did not reflect on it properly. Afterwards, he even accepted 100 jin of millet from the workers as compensation, compounding his exploitation of the workers. After the facts were verified, the bureau found that Feng Huaiyi, as a section chief, dared to deceive the public, exploit and profit, and deceive the workers. In addition to recovering all 100 jin of millet and returning it to the workers, he was dismissed from his position as section chief in order to maintain railway discipline and warn others against following his example.

    铁路职员冯怀义勾结私商剥削工人
    已经太原铁路局查明撤了职
    【本报讯】本报三月一日第一版刊载“铁路局职工冯怀义勾结私商投机倒把”消息，已经太原铁路管理局深入检查。事实经过情形如下：解放军野战一兵团采购员张同志，包给私营铁炉经理丁维士洋镐八百把，每把实价小米三十八斤。丁维士包到后，又由冯怀义经手转包给阳泉库铁工工友一百五十把，以作职工业余生产，每把小米三十斤。据了解：冯怀义由丁维士手中承包时，即由丁维士给他订立了两张合同，一张每把小米三十五斤，一张每把小米三十斤（该两张合同已为阳泉一区工会扣存），和工人面议是三十斤一把的那张合同，计一百五十把洋镐相差小米七百五十斤，事后为阳泉职工会知悉追究，被逼承认实有其事。给工人价款时，按每把三十五斤小米折给。当时冯怀义虽则承认，并不很好反省错误，事后竟又收了工人一百斤小米作报酬，一错再错剥削工人。事实查明后，该局以冯怀义身为股长，竟敢欺骗公家，剥削渔利欺瞒工人，除将小米一百斤全数追出退给工人外，撤除股长职务，以维路纪，而警效尤。
