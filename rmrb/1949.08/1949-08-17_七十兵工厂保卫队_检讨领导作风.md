　　Seventy Ordnance Factory Guard Team
  　Reviewing Leadership Style
    [Our Newspaper] In order to strengthen security work, the Seventy Ordnance Factory Guard Team recently held a review meeting for leaders at all levels. The meeting was attended by company commanders, platoon leaders, squad leaders, and representatives of the team members. First, Company Commander Lei Hengbao spoke, explaining that since the establishment of the Seventy Ordnance Factory Guard Team, there has been no sabotage, which is a result of the team members' heightened political awareness and their unwavering vigilance in guarding the people's own property. However, on the other hand, we still have many shortcomings. We must not be careless in the future and must be more vigilant. Team member representative Zhai Wanming said: Because of too few meetings for discussion, leaders at all levels in some places only care about coming forward themselves, and have failed to mobilize all team members to work well. Furthermore, when matters are reported, the administrative department and the trade union have not been quick to resolve or respond, which has caused dissatisfaction among the masses. Platoon leaders said: We have not paid special attention to leading the masses, and have failed to consider the masses in many places. We must thoroughly correct our previous mistakes in the future. Finally, Comrade Lei Hengbao reviewed that he lacked experience and failed to frequently approach and connect with the masses, and integrate with them. Moreover, he dared not take responsibility when things happened. He is determined to correct his past shortcomings in the future.

　　七十兵工厂保卫队
  　检讨领导作风
    【本报讯】七十兵工厂保卫队为了加强保卫工作，日前各级负责人召开了一个检讨会，到会有中队长、分队长、组长及队员代表等。首先，中队长雷恒保同志发言，说明七十兵工厂自从成立了保卫队，尚未发生被破坏的地方，这是队员们政治觉悟提高，时刻不放松的看守着人民自己的产业的收获；但另一方面我们还有好多的缺点，今后咱们更不可大意，要更加警惕才好。队员代表翟万明说：由于少开会讨论，各级领导人有些地方只顾自己出头来干，未能很好发动起全体队员来搞。更兼遇事反映上去，行政和职工会没有很快的解决或答复，以致引起群众们不满。分队负责人说：对于领导群众，未加特别注意，好多地方未顾及到群众，今后要彻底改正以前的错误。最后由雷恒保同志检讨自己经验不丰富，未能时常接近群众与群众联系，互相打成一片，并且遇事不敢负起责任，今后定要改正以往的缺点。
