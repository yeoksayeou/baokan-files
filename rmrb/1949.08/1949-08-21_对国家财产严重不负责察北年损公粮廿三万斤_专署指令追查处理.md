[Chahar News] The preliminary clearance of grain depots in the Chahar North Special District has concluded. After the clearance, it was discovered that over the past year, the district lost more than 230,000 jin of public grain due to corruption, theft, spoilage, misappropriation, and short weighting. Corruption and short weighting accounted for the largest proportion of the losses. In Kangbao @ Jiayingzi Village, the village cadres collectively embezzled 110 shi of grain. In Chongli Yimatou Village, a grain and fodder committee member embezzled 1,600 jin of public grain. In Zhangbei Zhangmaohudong Village, the village chief Yin Cunzhen alone embezzled 3,671 jin of naked oats. In Haoqian Village, the village chief, squad leader, grain and fodder personnel, and secretary collectively embezzled 688 jin of wheat, 965 jin of naked oats, and 266 jin of naked oat flour... The lack of uniform scales was one reason for short weighting, but the main reason was bureaucratic leadership that failed to promptly conduct thorough inspections at the grassroots level. Subordinates also failed to inspect and report, preventing timely resolution of the problems. Some knew about the issues but felt they were "nothing much" and failed to address them seriously and promptly. The most unacceptable error was the belief that "if we lose it, we can just report it for reimbursement; public grain is bound to be lost every year!" Protecting state property was merely lip service, and there was no serious inspection of the work. Or they believed that protecting state property only referred to public housing, and they did not pay enough attention to the management of public grain. This erroneous thinking is the main root cause of the losses of public grain.

Based on this, the Chahar North Special Commissioner's Office issued instructions to the county and district governments on August 3, ordering them to investigate the specific time, location, type of grain, and circumstances of each grain loss within a limited time, promptly investigate and handle the matter, and seriously examine the undisciplined phenomena and bureaucratic work style of the leadership.

　　对国家财产严重不负责察北年损公粮廿三万斤
    专署指令追查处理
    【察哈尔讯】察北专区初步清理粮库已告结束。经过清理后发现一年来全区公粮因贪污、偷盗、腐烂、挪用、折秤等共损失二十三万余斤。其中贪污、折秤两项比重最大。康保＠家营子村干部集体贪污粮食一百一十大石。崇礼驿马图村粮秣委员一人贪污公粮一千六百斤，张北张毛胡洞村长殷存珍一人贪污莜麦三千六百七十一斤。壕堑村村长、中队长、粮秣、秘书等集体贪污小麦六百八十八斤，莜麦九百六十五斤，莜面二百六十六斤……。折秤的原因，秤不统一虽是原因这一，但主要的还是领导上的官僚主义，没有及时深入下层进行检查，下级也不检查报告，致不能发现问题随时处理。有的虽知道一些，也觉得“没有什么”，而未认真及时处理。最不能允许的错误是认为“损失了向上报销吧，公家粮食每年都免不了损失？！”把保护国家财产只停留在口头空喊，未认真检查自己的工作。或者认为保护国家财产只指公房而言，对公粮管理却未引起重视。这种错误思想是造成公粮遭受损失的主要根源。
    据此，察北专署于八月三日向县、区政府发出指令，责成各地限期检查每宗粮食损失的具体时间、地点、粮种及经过情形，迅速追查处理，并认真的检查领导上的无纪律现象与官僚主义作风。
