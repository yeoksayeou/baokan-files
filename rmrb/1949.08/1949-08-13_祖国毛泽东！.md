"Motherland Mao Zedong!"
By Bai Hua

"Long live, beloved motherland!
Long live, beloved Mao Zedong!
You are the lighthouse in the night's voyage,
You are the savior of the Taiwanese people!
With you, we have a motherland;
Motherland Mao Zedong,
Motherland—Mao—Ze—Dong!"
This is the excited and fervent singing of the Taiwanese youth studying at the North China Military and Political University, as they happily dance the Gaoshan dance.

I.

Speaking of Taiwan, everyone thinks of a lush green banana leaf floating in the sea in the southeast of our country's map. There, forests are dense, the fields are filled with the fresh fragrance of rice, and are full of sugar cane, camphor, banyan, betel nut... fully demonstrating the charm of the South. And on this island, coal, oil, gold, aluminum... are endless. In addition, there are the excellent ports of Keelung and Kaohsiung, which can dock ships weighing around 10,000 tons. ... This is the acclaimed "Eden on Earth," the "Beautiful Treasure Island"!

Invaders coveted this happy land, with the Dutch and Japanese successively extending their bloody claws to plunder and commit atrocities! But for fifty years, the Taiwanese people have bravely and relentlessly carried out non-stop struggles—the enlightenment movement, the parliamentary movement, the peasant movement, workers' strikes, and many armed uprisings stained with blood.

In the difficult years, the Taiwanese people urgently demanded their liberation, eagerly awaiting the salvation of the "motherland," hoping day and night to return to the embrace of their motherland. ...

Japan surrendered, and the "days of victory" arrived. Taiwan "returned to the embrace of the motherland!" But everything the Kuomintang bandit gang brought was beyond the imagination of the Taiwanese people: extortion, rape, looting, and large-scale collective robbery... As a result, prices soared, all industries declined, there was a rice shortage and a sugar shortage, workers were unemployed, and farmers could not get enough to eat, while the big officials of the "motherland" ate, drank, and made merry, doing whatever they pleased. The pigs grew fatter day by day, while the Taiwanese people tightened their belts tighter and tighter. This is the heavy disaster that the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism brought to the Taiwanese people when they came to Taiwan.

December 17, 1946 (a day the Taiwanese people will never forget). Early in the morning, the "National Army" set up machine guns at the Keelung port pier, and sentries held bright bayonets. Batch after batch of Taiwan's outstanding sons were forced to carry guns with the firing pins removed, trembling as they boarded ships heading for the "motherland" to slaughter their compatriots!

"A-Jin!" "My son!" "Brother!" ... Cries of misery came from the station to the coast.

Many parents, brothers, and sisters, disregarding the "National Army's" beatings, desperately tried to catch up, but they could no longer see their sons (brothers) imprisoned in the iron cabins.

"Let me go up to urinate!"

"I just want to say a word to my mother!"

………………

Cries for help filled the iron cabin, and the bolder ones climbed to the top of the cabin.

"You motherf\*\*\*er, get down!" A kick sent them down, followed by beatings and miserable wails. ...

At this time, there was struggling on the ship to escape the cage, and shouting on the shore by those who had lost their loved ones. The whistle sounded, and the howls of tens of thousands of people drowned out everything, but the ship moved relentlessly, and so many parents, wives, brothers, and sisters! Watched, watched the shadow of the ship that would sail away into the waves...

"Hey! Someone jumped into the sea!"

"No! Another one, fire!"

"What's wrong with you?"

"Sir! He's sick, he's my cousin."

"Sick! Good, throw him down to feed the turtles!" Splash—: The surging sea stirred up waves, the person floated a few times, and then disappeared!

…………………

II.

Fierce artillery fire, severe cold weather, the Taiwanese youth sent to the North China battlefield waited on the brink of death to be used as cannon fodder for the Chiang bandit gang.

But, happy days finally arrived. More than twenty days later, on January 9, 1947, the People's Liberation Army liberated Jinxiang and Yutai, and also liberated the Taiwanese youth who had been captured from their distant island home.

The people—the people of the motherland, the People's Liberation Army held welcoming parties for them everywhere, and the leaders and comrades of the troops warmly and cordially comforted them. Those who had suffered hardship found their motherland!

After a short period of education and grievance-telling in the People's Liberation Army, the troops were about to march down the Longhai Road to attack. The Taiwanese youth all rushed to sign up. Carrying rifles with fixed bayonets and hearts burning with hatred, they plunged into the great People's Liberation War.

Excellent artilleryman Li Hao Lan overturned an enemy artillery vehicle with one shot. Sharpshooter Chen Zengkun killed seven enemies with ten shots. Chen Changhui even bravely braved the artillery fire to carry the wounded platoon leader and Comrade Song Dazhu to a safe place; and then charged towards the blockhouse—the most heavily fortified place. More than twenty enemies were driven by Li Guang from upstairs to downstairs, who single-handedly disarmed them and captured them all. Zhong Daochao climbed over the wall alone, and with his ingenuity and a hand grenade, he eliminated more than forty enemies. In the Stone Mountain battle, Liao Xianjing engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the enemy to rescue a wounded soldier; when the enemy counterattacked and the squad leader was separated from the group, he stepped forward and shouted, "Follow me, heroes!" leading the entire squad to charge forward, winning a complete victory. Chen Guoying consistently excelled in his studies and work after liberation, and in the most critical situation, he was the first to volunteer to fight tanks. …

Yes, many Taiwanese youth were recognized as brave combat heroes. Liao Xianjing was selected as a special-class combat model, and Chen Guoying was approved by the Tiger Unit to become the first Taiwanese Communist Party member in General Liu Bocheng's troops!

When everyone celebrated with gongs and drums, presenting glorious flowers to these outstanding sons of the Taiwanese people—the meritorious servants of the people, this ardent scene moved them even more. "Why weren't you so energetic when you were in the 'National Army,' but after joining the People's Liberation Army for less than a month, you fought so fiercely?" A curious comrade asked.

"Isn't that simple? The Chiang bandits caused our families to be destroyed and people to die, and they also captured us to be cannon fodder, how can we not beat them hard!? We have understood that fighting now is for ourselves, for the final liberation of our hometowns, are we not happy? Are we not putting in effort?" Their voices were so crisp and forceful.

III.

When the news of the "February 28th" Taiwanese people's armed uprising fighting heroically against the Chiang Kai-shek government reached the front line of Yuwansu, all the Taiwanese comrades were ecstatic. They searched for newspapers everywhere and discussed writing telegrams together. Blackboards in the streets were filled with their celebratory articles; Taiwanese comrades in the front-line corps were busily holding celebratory meetings.

"The elders and brothers in our hometown are rising up, we must fight a few beautiful battles to create a north-south echo, and make the dogshit Chiang Kai-shek perish sooner!"

"Right! We must study hard and strive to earn more merits in battle!"

"We should also step up efforts to improve our skills and return to Keelung and Kaohsiung to organize our fellow villagers to fight for the construction of a new Taiwan!"

"Good!" "Good!" ...

The people of the treasure island of Taiwan have risen up to fight, and the Taiwanese youth participating in the Liberation War are even more joyfully swept into the tide of struggle.

IV.

The order came down to transfer some Taiwanese youth to the Military and Political University to study. The leaders' speeches were exceptionally simple: "Chairman Mao is so sincerely concerned about you and wants to train you to become the backbone of the liberation of Taiwan!" So they quickly and happily rushed to the Military and Political University.

On the way, they sang a song they had composed themselves:

"From the front line we came to the rear,
Coming to the Military University, so happy!
In the past, we couldn't study,
Today we attend our own university.
Wholeheartedly we come to study,
To learn our skills and return to Taiwan.
Resolutely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek,
And build a new Taiwan!"

Arriving at the school, they began to study the culture of the motherland, the basic problems of the Chinese revolution, the history of social development, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the modern history of the Chinese revolution... Everyone felt like they had found a lighthouse in the ocean voyage, like a group of lost children who found a pointer forward.

How happy and joyful they were, singing songs during class, note-taking, discussions, and games; they also composed Gaoshan folk songs and sang them on high slopes. They also wrote and performed the historical drama of "February 28th," it was self-written and self-directed; to alert the few people among them who were proud and complacent, they also wrote and performed "The Story of Xie Agou" as a mirror to educate themselves.

The worker comrades among them used their class-specific excellent qualities and production technology to install electric lights for the school. The construction, which was originally planned to cost sixty workdays and more than 14 million yuan, was completed perfectly by them in just sixteen days. They also displayed their diligence on the production front, harvesting more than 8,000 catties of vegetables, and using their creativity to overcome all difficulties. They showed initiative and heroic creativity everywhere.

V.

The North China Military and Political University has improved their cultural and political awareness. How inspired and happy they are to live in the Military and Political University, one of the highest institutions of the Communist Party of China!

They couldn't help but discuss with each other enthusiastically:

"I see my real motherland!"

"Yes! Since I was liberated by the People's Liberation Army, I began to have this feeling after the first welcoming party."

"Rely on imperialism? Whether it's the Netherlands, the United States, or Japan, aren't they all trying to destroy us!"

"Chiang Kai-shek is a traitorous motherf\*\*\*er, our Taiwanese people have finally seen through him this time; he can no longer fool our people with that 'motherland' facade!"

"Yes, iron facts, bloody lessons, everything in the past tells us: the motherland lies in the struggle for liberation of our Chinese people and the Taiwanese people themselves! Mao Zedong is our true motherland!!"

"Right! We can't have a motherland without struggle, and the banner leading the people's struggle is our Chinese people's leader Mao Zedong!"

"Ah! Right! You're absolutely right! Mao Zedong is the banner of our struggle! Our motherland is Mao Zedong!"

"Long live, long live!"

"Motherland—Mao…Ze…Dong…"!

### “祖国毛泽东！”

专栏：

    “祖国毛泽东！”
    柏桦
    “万岁呵！亲爱的祖国！
     万岁呵！亲爱的毛泽东！
     你是黑夜航行的灯塔，
     你是台湾人民的救星！
     我们有了你，我们就有了祖国；
     祖国毛泽东，
     祖国——毛——泽——东！”
    这是在华北军政大学学习的台湾青年们，当欢快而跳着高山舞的时候，兴奋而热诚的歌唱。
  一
    说起台湾，大家就会想到在我国版图东南的海里，浮着一片葱绿色的芭蕉叶。在那里森林密茂，田野里泛着清新的稻香，满长着甘蔗、樟、榕、槟榔……更充分表现出南国的风彩。而在这个岛子上，煤、石油、金、铝……又是无穷无尽。此外，还有能停泊载重一万吨左右轮船的基隆、高雄良港。……这就是被人称道的“人间的伊甸”、“美丽的宝岛”呵！
    对这块幸福的土地，侵略者都红了眼，荷兰、日本相继伸着血爪来掠夺，来行凶！但五十年来，台湾人民英勇地、前仆后继地进行不息的斗争——启蒙运动、议会运动、农民运动、工人罢工及多次洒着鲜血的武装暴动。
    在艰苦的岁月里，台湾人民迫切要求着自己的解放，迫切的期待着“祖国”的拯救，他们日夜盼望着回到自己祖国的怀抱。……
    日本投降了，“胜利的日子”到来了，台湾“回到祖国的怀抱”了！但国民党匪帮带来的一切，都是台湾人民想象不到的，敲诈、奸淫、搜括、大规模的集体抢劫……，于是物价暴涨，百业萧条，米荒、糖荒，工人失业，农民食不饱，而“祖国”的大官员们吃喝玩乐，无所不为。猪猡们吃的一天比一天肥，而台湾人民的裤带却一天比一天束的紧了。这就是卖国贼蒋介石及美帝国主义，来到台湾，给台湾人民带来的沉重的灾难。
    一九四六年十二月十七日（这是台湾人民难忘记的一天）清晨，“国军”在基隆港码头架起了机枪，哨兵端着明晃晃的刺刀，一大批一大批的台湾人民优秀的子孙呵，就被逼着背上了抽出撞针的枪，颤抖着爬上开赴“祖国”的轮船，去屠杀祖国的同胞！
    “阿金呵！”“我的儿呵！”“哥呵！”……从车站到海岸传来了一阵阵惨叫。
    多少人的父母、兄弟、姊妹们，不顾“国军”的鞭打，拚命的追上来了，但是再也见不到了，他们的儿子（弟兄）被囚进铁舱去了。
    “让我上去小便一下吧！”
    “我只和我母亲说一句话就行了！”
    ………………
    求告声充满了铁舱，大胆些的就往舱顶上爬了。
    “你妈的×，下去！”一脚踢下来，紧接着就是鞭打和悲惨的哀叫。……
    这时，船上的挣扎要逃出囚笼，岸上的嘶喊着失去了亲人。汽笛响了，成千万人的嚎啕声淹没了一切，但船无情地开动了，多少人的父母、妻子、弟妹呵！望着，望着那将破浪远扬的船影……
    “喂！一个跳海了！”
    “不！又一个，开枪！”
    “你是怎么的？”
    “老爷！他有病，他是我的堂兄弟。”
    “有病！好，扔下去喂王八！”扑通——：汹涌的海水掀起了浪花，人浮了几浮，再也看不见了！
    …………………
  二
    炽烈的炮火，严寒的天气，送往华北战场的台湾青年，在死亡线上等待着给蒋匪帮当内战炮灰。
    但，幸福的日子终于到来了，二十多天以后，即一九四七年的一月九日，人民解放军解放了金乡、鱼台，也解放了从遥远的岛乡抓来的台湾青年。
    人民——祖国的人民，解放军到处为他们开欢迎会，部队首长和同志们亲切而热烈地安慰他们，受尽苦难的人们，找到了祖国！
    他们到解放军里，经过短短一段教育和诉苦，队伍就要下陇海路出击了，台湾青年都抢先报了名，他们背着上好刺刀的步枪，带着燃烧着仇恨的心，投入伟大的人民解放战争。
    优秀炮手李亳兰，一炮就把敌人飞驶的炮车打翻。神枪手陈增坤，十枪打死了七个敌人。陈长辉更勇敢地冒着炮火，把负伤的班长和宋大竹同志背到安全的地方；而自己又向炮楼——火力最密集地方冲去。二十多个敌人被李光从楼上赶到楼下，一个人缴了他们的枪，全部俘虏了他们。钟道超独自翻过围墙，凭他的机智和一颗手榴弹，就解决了四十多个敌人。在石头山战斗，廖先景为了抢救一个伤员，猛烈与敌人进行肉搏；敌人反冲锋，班长掉了队，他挺身而出，大喊“好汉跟我来！”带领着全班猛冲过去，胜利打了一个歼灭战。陈国英解放后学习工作一贯优良，而在最危急情况下，他第一个自动报名打坦克。……
    是的，多少台湾青年都被公认为勇敢的战斗英雄，廖先景就被选为特等战斗模范，陈国英被虎字部批准，成为刘伯承将军部队里的第一名台湾籍共产党员！
    当大家锣鼓喧天，给台湾人民这些优秀的子孙——人民的功臣，挂光荣花时，这炽烈的场面，更大地感动了他们。“为什么你们当‘国军’时，打仗那样不起劲，可是到解放军还没一个月，就打得这样猛呢？”好奇的同志这样问。
    “这还不简单，蒋贼闹得咱家破人亡，还抓来当炮灰，咱怎能不狠狠地揍他呢！？我们已懂得了现在打仗是为了自己，为了最后解放自己家乡，我们还不高兴吗？我们还不出力气吗？”他们的声音是那样干脆、有力。
  三
    当“二、二八”台湾人民武装起义，与蒋介石政府作着英勇斗争的消息，传到了豫皖苏前线的时候，所有台湾同志都欢喜若狂了。他们到处找报纸，共同商量着写通电。街上的黑板报贴满了他们的庆祝文章；前线各兵团的台湾同志，都在热烈的忙着召开庆祝会。
    “家乡的父老兄弟都干起来了，咱们可要好好打几个漂亮仗，来一个南北交辉，叫狗日的蒋介石早完蛋！”
    “对！咱们要好好学习，争取在战斗中多立上几功！”
    “咱们还应该加紧提高自己的本领，回到基隆、高雄，好把乡亲们组织起来，为建设新台湾而斗争！”
    “好呵！”“好呵！”……
    台湾宝岛的人民起来斗争了，参加解放战争的台湾青年呵！更喜悦地卷入斗争的热潮。
  四
    命令下来了，要调一部分台湾青年到军政大学去学习。首长们讲话是异常简单：“毛主席是那么热诚的关怀着你们，要培养你们成为解放台湾的骨干！”于是他们就迅速地欢欣的奔赴军政大学了。
    路上，他们唱着一支歌自己编的歌：
     “从前线来到了后方，
     来到军大呵，喜洋洋！
     过去念书念不上，
     今天上了自己的大学堂。
     一心一意呵来学习，
     学好本领回台湾。
     坚决消灭蒋介石，
     建设新台湾呵！”
    来到学校，开始学习着祖国的文化、中国革命的基本问题、社会发展史、国民党和共产党、中国近代革命运动史……。大家象从大海的航行中找到了灯塔，象一群迷途的孩子，找到前进的指针。
    他们是多么愉快和高兴呵，上课、写笔记、开讨论会、游戏的时间，唱着歌；他们还自己编了高山族民歌，站在高坡上唱。他们还编演了“二、二八”的历史剧，是他们自编自演的；为了警惕他们中少数人的骄傲自满，又编演了“谢阿狗的故事”，作为教育自己的借镜。
    他们中工人同志用自己阶级特有的优良品质和生产技术，为学校装置了电灯。原拟花六十个工、一千四百多万元巨款才能做到的建设，他们仅以十六天的突击，美满的完成了。他们更在生产战线上，以自己的辛勤，收获了八千多斤蔬菜，和用自己的创造，来克服所有的困难。他们到处都显示出积极性和英雄的创造性。
  五
    华北军政大学提高了他们文化与政治觉悟，他们生活在中国共产党最高学府之一的军政大学里，多么感奋与愉快呵！
    他们情不自禁的互相兴致勃勃的议论着：
    “我看到自己的真正祖国了！”
    “对！我自被解放军解放，第一晚开欢迎会以后，我就开始有这么一个感觉。”
    “靠帝国主义？不管荷兰、美国、日本、他们还不都是为着要灭亡我们！”
    “蒋介石他妈的卖国贼，咱们台湾人民，这回可总算是把他看透了；他那‘祖国’的幌子，再也别想骗咱老百姓了！”
    “是的，铁的事实，血的教训，以往的一切，都告诉着：祖国就在我们中国人民、台湾人民自身解放的斗争中！毛泽东才是我们真正的祖国！！”
    “对！我们不斗争那还能有祖国，领导人民斗争的旗帜呵，就是我们中国人民的领袖毛泽东！”
    “呵！对！说的完全对！毛泽东是我们斗争的旗帜！我们的祖国就是毛泽东！”
    “万岁呵，万岁呵！”
    “祖国——毛……泽……东……”！
