    The Beginning of the American Economic Crisis
    Hu Weide
    The National Committee meeting of the American Communist Party, held on April 23rd and 24th this year, pointed out: "The American people are facing the beginning of an economic crisis, which has been developing in the United States since the end of last year." Facts in the past few months have proven that the American Communist Party National Committee's estimate is completely correct. That is to say, the initial stage of the American economic crisis, namely the stage of gradual decline in production, has begun since the end of last year.
    As a result of overproduction, American industrial production began to decline across the board in a straight line from December of last year, and this decline is still continuing. Last autumn was the peak of the post-war prosperity in the United States. The American industrial production index reached 195 in both October and November of last year (with the average of 1935-1939 as 100). December of last year was the turning point of the post-war economy in the United States. The American industrial production index after December is as follows: December – 190, January of this year – 187, February – 185, March – 181, April – 179, May – 174, June – 169. In July of this year, there are no official figures for the industrial production index, but according to the US official body, the President's Economic Advisory Council, it may drop to 163. Compared with the industrial production index in June of this year and October of last year, it has decreased by 26 points, that is, 13 percent. This is a huge drop.
    As early as 1947 and 1948, the level of American industrial production fluctuated, which was a manifestation of the instability of the post-war economic situation in the United States. In the first quarter of 1948, along with the sharp fall in agricultural product prices, the production of light industry in the United States began to decline. From the first quarter to the third quarter of 1948, the reduction in production had spread from the cotton and wool textile industry to dozens of light industries such as leather, rubber, wood, shoe manufacturing, glass, radios, electric refrigerators, movies, and trucks. The radio industry, which produces more than 30 million units annually, only operated at 46 percent capacity in 1948. Factories manufacturing electric refrigerators, with a total annual output of 7 million units, only operated at 70 percent capacity in 1948. One might ask: why was there a peak of post-war prosperity last autumn after the production of light industry had already declined? This was mainly due to the abnormal prosperity of heavy industry, especially the steel industry. In October of last year, the production volume of the steel industry was as high as 7.9 million tons, which was not only the highest peak of the post-war level, but also reached the highest peak of the wartime level.
    However, the abnormal prosperity of heavy industry could not last long. Since November of last year, the decline in production has spread from light industry to heavy industry (including steel, iron, non-ferrous metals, machinery manufacturing and other industries). According to statistics as of late July, the production level of heavy industry has decreased by 15 percent compared with November of last year.
    Among heavy industries, the production volume of the machinery manufacturing industry has decreased by 20 percent from the end of last year to May of this year.
    The decline in production in the leading industry in heavy industry – the steel industry – is particularly noteworthy. Although the steel industry's production did not begin to decline until March of this year, once it declined, it continued for twelve consecutive weeks, and in the later period it turned into a sharp decline. In July of this year, the production level of the steel industry decreased by 25 percent compared with the post-war peak.
    Regarding mining production, according to statistics as of late July, it has decreased by 16 percent compared with November of last year.
    Due to the widespread reduction in production in industry and mining, the volume of train freight, which is generally considered an accurate barometer of the entire economy, has also declined. According to the American Railway Association, in the week from July 3rd to 9th, the volume of train freight decreased by 21.2 percent compared with the same week last year.
    This is a general picture of the decline in the production level of American industry and mining and the freight volume of the main transportation industries.
    What are the reasons for this decline? The fundamental reason lies in the insurmountable contradiction of the American economy, which is produced in a capitalist way, that is, the contradiction between the social nature of production and the private nature of ownership, which is manifested as the internal contradiction between the huge productivity and the narrow market. The United States accounts for 60 percent of the total industrial production in the post-war capitalist world. In 1948, the total value of all goods and services produced in the United States was as high as 253 billion US dollars. However, American monopoly capital is facing an increasingly shrinking domestic and foreign market.
    In the domestic market, all the facts show that the purchasing power of the working people and general consumers has become increasingly weak, because of the high prices and reduced real wages after the war, as well as the surge in unemployment. According to the "Economic Record" published by the American Progressive Labor Research Association, from January 1945 to August 1948, the increase in income of employed people in the United States was only 13.4 percent, while the increase in living expenses had reached 37.3 percent. According to statistics, in 1948, the minimum living expenses for each family of four in the United States was 4,100 US dollars, however, the income of 60 percent of families that year was less than 3,000 US dollars. As a result of the large number of business closures caused by overproduction (4,581 companies went bankrupt in the first half of this year, almost doubling compared with the same period last year), the number of unemployed people has greatly increased. According to the Electrical and Radio Workers Union, the total number of fully unemployed people in July has reached 5.9 million, and the Progressive Party estimates that it will reach 10 million by the end of the year. As for the number of semi-unemployed people, it has already reached 12 million at present.
    In the foreign market, although American monopoly capital has implemented the Marshall Plan in an attempt to use it as an important means to solve the economic crisis, exports have not only not increased, but have decreased instead. Compared with 1947, the value of American exports in 1948 has decreased by 18 percent, and the amount of exports has decreased by 23 percent. The reasons are: First, as a result of the implementation of the Marshall Plan, the economies of Western European countries have not tended to "revive," but have tended to decline, thereby weakening their ability to purchase goods from the United States; Second, the reactionary foreign policy of the American reactionaries has completely prevented the possibility of developing trade with the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries in Eastern Europe; Third, this reactionary diplomacy has also weakened American trade with the new China and other Eastern countries that are in the midst of liberation struggles.
    According to the current situation, it can be predicted that American industrial production will continue to decline. Perhaps the gradual decline will have to go through a period of time before reaching a crash, but even the representative publication of American monopoly capital has to admit this downward trend. "U.S. News & World Report" magazine wrote this spring: "The decline in production that began in December of last year is accelerating. The expected rise in the spring did not materialize. Looking to the future is a continuing decline."
    The beginning and continued development of the initial stage of the American economic crisis, on the one hand, is destroying the American capitalist economy, and will continue to suffer greater destruction, on the other hand, it is increasing the contradictions within the United States and between it and other capitalist countries, and will continue to grow. The day when American imperialism is at its end is not too far away. (Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 12th)

### 美国经济危机的开端

    美国经济危机的开端
    胡韦德
    今年四月二十三日至二十四日举行的美国共产党全国委员会会议指出：“美国人民面对着一个经济危机的开始，这个经济危机从去年年底以来已在美国发展中。”几个月以来的事实证明：美共全国委员会的这一估计是完全正确的。这就是说，美国经济危机的初期阶段，即生产逐步下跌阶段，已经从去年年底开始。
    由于生产过剩的结果，美国工业生产从去年十二月开始全面地直线下降，这种下降迄今仍在继续中。去年秋天是美国战后繁荣的顶点。美国工业生产的指数在去年十月和十一月都曾达到一九五（以一九三五——一九三九年的平均数为一○○）。去年十二月乃是美国战后经济的转折点。美国工业生产在十二月以后的指数如下：十二月——一九○，今年一月——一八七，二月——一八五，三月——一八一，四月——一七九，五月——一七四，六月——一六九。今年七月份，工业生产指数还没有正式的数字，但据美官方机关总统经济顾问委员会估计，可能降至一六三。如以今年六月份的工业生产指数和去年十月份相比，那么已经下降了二十六点，即百分之十三。这是一个巨大的下跌。
    早在一九四七年和一九四八年，美国工业生产量的水平就曾发生波动，这是美国战后经济情势不稳定的表现。在一九四八年第一季，与农产品价格暴跌同时，美国轻工业的生产即已开始下降。从一九四八年第一季到第三季，减产已经从棉毛纺织工业，延及皮革、橡皮、木材、制鞋、玻璃、收音机、电气冰箱、电影、卡车等数十种轻工业中。每年生产过三千万单位的无线电工业，在一九四八年只有百分之四十六开工。每年总产量可达七百万单位的制造电气冰箱的工厂，一九四八年只开工百分之七十。人们会问：当轻工业的生产量已经下降之后，为什么还会有去年秋天战后繁荣的顶点呢？这主要是由于重工业特别是钢工业的畸形繁荣所造成。去年十月，钢工业的生产量高达七百九十余万吨，这不仅是战后水平的最高峰，而且达到战时水平的最高峰。
    但是，重工业的畸形繁荣，维持不了好久。自去年十一月以后，生产的下降由轻工业延及重工业（包括钢、铁、非铁金属、机器制造等工业）。根据截至七月下旬的统计，重工业的生产水平与去年十一月相比，已下降了百之十五。
    在重工业中，机器制造工业的生产量，自去年年底至今年五月止，已下降了百分之二十。
    重工业中的领导工业——钢工业生产下降的情形，尤其值得注意。钢工业的生产虽延迟至今年三月始行下降，但一经下降即连续十二周，且在后期转为急剧下降。今年七月份，钢工业的生产水平与战后最高峰相较，已下降了百分之二十五。
    关于矿业生产，根据截至七月下旬的统计，与去年十一月相比，已下降了百分之十六。
    由于工业与矿业的普遍减产，一般被认为是整个经济的准确气压计的火车运货量，亦已下降。据美国铁路联合会估计：自七月三日至九日的一周中，火车运货量比去年同周已减少了百分之二十一点二。
    这就是美国工矿业生产水平和主要运输业运货量下降的概略情形。
    造成这种下降的原因是什么呢？根本的原因在于按照资本主义方式进行生产的美国经济，有着不可克服的矛盾，即生产的社会性和占有的私人性的矛盾，其表现即为生产力的庞大和市场的狭小的内在矛盾。在战后资本主义世界的工业总生产中，美国的生产量竟占百分之六十。一九四八年，美国全部货物与劳务生产的总值，高达二千五百三十亿美元。可是，美国独占资本却面临着一个日益缩小的国内和国外市场。
    在国内市场方面，所有的事实显示：劳动人民和一般消费者的购买力已日益微弱，这是因为战后物价高涨，实际工资减少以及失业者激增的缘故。据美国进步的劳工研究协会出版的“经济纪录”载称，自一九四五年一月至一九四八年八月，美国被雇人员收入的增加，仅为百分之十三点四，而生活费用的增加，却已达到百分之三十七点三。根据统计，一九四八年，美国每个四口之家的家庭，其最低生活需要费用是四千一百元，然而，有百分之六十的家庭，这一年的收入却低于三千元。由于生产过剩所造成的大批企业倒闭的结果（本年上半年有四千五百八十一家公司破产，与去年同期比较，几乎增加一倍），使失业人口大大增加了。据电气及无线电工人工会估计，在七月份完全失业者的总数已达五百九十万，进步党估计年底将达一千万。至于半失业者的人数，则在目前已经达到一千二百万。
    在国外市场方面，美国独占资本虽然实行了马歇尔计划，企图借此作为解救经济危机的重要手段，可是，输出不但没有增加，却反而减少了。一九四八年美国的出口与一九四七年相比，在价值上已减少了百分之十八，在出口数额上已减少了百分之二十三。其原因是：第一，实施马歇尔计划的结果，西欧各国的经济不是趋于“复兴”了，而是趋于衰退了，从而减弱了它们自美国购货的能力；第二，美国反动派的外交政策，完全阻止了和苏联及东欧新民主国家发展贸易的可能；第三，这种反动外交，又削弱了美国对于新中国和其他正处于解放斗争中的东方各国贸易。
    根据目前的情势，可以预测：美国工业生产势将继续下降，也许在到达暴跌以前，逐步下跌还要经历一个时期，但是，这种下降的趋势，连美国独占资本的代表刊物也不得不加以承认。“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志在今年春天写道：“开始于去年十二月的生产下降，其速度正在加快。所期望于春季的上升并未实现。瞻望前途是继续的下降。”
    美国经济危机初期阶段的开始及其继续发展，一方面使美国的资本主义经济遭受着破坏，而且将继续遭受更大的破坏，另一方面使美国国内及其与其他资本主义国家之间的矛盾日益增长，而且将继续增长。美国帝国主义日暮途穷的时候，是不会太远了。            （新华社北平十二日电）
