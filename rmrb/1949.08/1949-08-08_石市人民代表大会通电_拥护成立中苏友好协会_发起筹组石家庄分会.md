    Shijiazhuang People's Congress Telegram
    Supporting the Establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    Initiating the Preparation for the Shijiazhuang Branch
    [Shijiazhuang Dispatch] The first Shijiazhuang People's Congress passed a telegram on the 4th to the preparatory committee of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, supporting the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Mayor Liu Xiufeng and 32 representatives of the congress initiated the preparation for the Shijiazhuang branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, in order to further develop and consolidate the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, learn from the Soviet Union's experience in production and construction, and work together for the world's lasting peace and people's democracy. The people of Shijiazhuang have realized that the Soviet Union is the closest and most reliable friend of the Chinese people. Without the Soviet Union, the Chinese revolution could not have been so quickly victorious. Without the Soviet Union, it would also be impossible to consolidate our revolutionary victory. Especially in the two production competitions last year and this year, the people of Shijiazhuang have personally experienced that the Soviet Union's experience in socialist construction is of great help to our New Democratic industrial construction. Without accepting the Soviet Union's experience in industrial construction and without obtaining the Soviet Union's help in industrial technology, our economic construction is also impossible.

    石市人民代表大会通电
    拥护成立中苏友好协会
    发起筹组石家庄分会
    【石家庄电】石家庄首届人民代表大会，四日通过致电中苏友好协会筹备会，拥护成立中苏友好协会，并由刘秀峰市长及大会代表三十二人发起筹组中苏友好协会石家庄分会，以便进一步发展与巩固中苏两国人民的友谊，学习苏联生产建设的经验，共同为世界的持久和平与人民民主而努力。石家庄人民已经认识到苏联是中国人民最亲密最可靠的朋友，没有苏联，中国革命这样迅速胜利也是不能的，没有苏联，要巩固我们革命的胜利也是不可能的，特别在去年和今年的两次生产竞赛中，石家庄的人民更亲身体验到苏联社会主义建设的经验，对我们新民主主义的工业建设是有极大帮助的。不接受苏联工业建设的经验，不取得苏联工业技术的帮助，我们的经济建设也是不可能的。
