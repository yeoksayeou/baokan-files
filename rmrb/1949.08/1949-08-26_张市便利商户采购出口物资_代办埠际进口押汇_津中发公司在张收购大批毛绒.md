　　【Zhangjiakou News】To encourage exporters to directly purchase products in the interior, the Zhangjiakou Branch of the People's Bank of China has been accepting entrusted inter-port import usance business from the Tianjin Branch of the Bank of China since last month. On the 14th of this month, it also handled this business with Tianjin Zhongfa Company. The company came to Zhangjiakou to purchase cashmere and camel hair, with a credit limit of 20 million yuan. It has now purchased: 1,748 jin of white cashmere, 2,330 jin of white goat cashmere, 455.5 jin of cashmere, 546 jin of white down, 692 jin of loose white down, 2,731 jin of goat cashmere, and 3,271 jin of camel hair, totaling 19.62 million yuan. This business provides great convenience for exporters to purchase local products in the interior. Currently, Dalae Trading Company and others will continue to negotiate. However, there are still many inconveniences in terms of insurance limits and freight charges, and discussions are underway to seek improvements to facilitate the smooth export of local products from the interior.
