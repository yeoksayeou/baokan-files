Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 26th: Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent a telegram congratulating the American Communist Party on its thirtieth anniversary. The telegram reads as follows:

Comrades Foster and Dennis,

We, the Chinese Communists and the Chinese working people, warmly celebrate the 30th anniversary of the American Communist Party. The American Communist Party and American progressives, under the high pressure of the American reactionary forces, have persevered in an indomitable struggle for international peace, for the democratic rights of American workers and the American people, and for the sincere friendship between the Chinese and American peoples. This is an important encouragement and assistance to the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world. The future of the United States does not belong to the outwardly strong but inwardly weak American reactionary forces, but to you and the American people. We celebrate the success of your struggles and those of the American people, and celebrate the continued strengthening of the solidarity of the working classes and peoples of China and the United States.

Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
August 23, 1949
