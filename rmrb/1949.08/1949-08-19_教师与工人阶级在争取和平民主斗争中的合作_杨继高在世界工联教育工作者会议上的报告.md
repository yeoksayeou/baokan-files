Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: Warsaw Dispatch: At the World Federation of Trade Unions Educational Workers Department meeting held on the 13th, the Chinese representative, Yang Jigao, delivered a report on "Cooperation Between Teachers and the Working Class in the Struggle for Peace and Democracy." He stated: The World Federation of Trade Unions, in close cooperation with the World Federation of Democratic Women, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and other organizations, has united millions of educational workers to jointly wage a struggle for lasting peace and democracy and against warmongers.

Mr. Yang then detailed the plight of teachers in capitalist countries, stating that American teachers' salaries are lower than those of unskilled workers, they have no pensions, and no leave during long-term illness or pregnancy. Shameful inequalities still exist in the remuneration of female teachers. Teachers are often dismissed because of their political beliefs. Between 1940 and 1945, 350,000 people in the United States abandoned educational work. The fate of black teachers in America is even more unfortunate. Educational funding in the United States has been drastically reduced. In 1948, education funding was $250 million, only enough to cover 4% of school expenses. At the same time, the military budget reached $18 billion, 72 times the education budget. In the United States, 6 million children and adolescents, or one-sixth of school-age children, cannot even enter primary school.

In Japan, the American occupation authorities have neither rebuilt the education system nor eliminated militarist culture. In Italy, the lackeys of the reactionaries, with the active assistance of the American occupation authorities, monopolized the Ministry of Education and local education authorities. The henchmen of the Vatican rule Italian teacher organizations, denying teacher organizations the opportunity to protest the current situation.

Mr. Yang then pointed out that France provided an outstanding example of cooperation between teachers and the working class. Progressive French teachers, as an organized force of the working class under the leadership of the French General Confederation of Labor, participated in the general strike at the end of 1947.

After describing the progress of education in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, Mr. Yang spoke about the situation of education in China, saying: Millions of the People's Liberation Army have become schools for basic education for the masses.

Mr. Yang concluded by saying: The purpose of the Educational Workers Department is to solve the major tasks of democratically reforming the education system, improving the living standards of teachers, and realizing the principle of "equal pay for equal work." Educational workers face a major and noble task - to enlighten the masses and to educate the world's youth in the spirit of friendship between countries and loyalty to peace and democracy. This task can only be solved with the support of the broad masses of working people.

　　教师与工人阶级在争取和平民主斗争中的合作
    杨继高在世界工联教育工作者会议上的报告
    【新华社北平十七日电】华沙讯：世界工联所属教育工作者职工部会议十三日举行会议时，中国代表杨继高作关于“教师与工人阶级在争取和平民主斗争中的合作”的报告。场氏称：世界工联在与世界民主妇联、青联及其他团体的紧密合作中，又团结了一批数以百万计的教育工作者，共同进行争取持久和平民主、反对战争贩子的斗争。
    杨氏继详述资本主义国家教师的厄运称：美国教师的薪资比不熟练工人还要低，没有养老金，且在长期害病或怀孕期间没有假期。对女教师的报酬仍然存在着可耻的不平等。教师常常因为其政治信仰而被辞退。在一九四○到一九四五年这五年间，美国有三十五万人放弃了教育工作。美国黑人教师的命运更是不幸。美国的教育经费已极度减低。一九四八年教育经费为二亿五千万美元，仅够支付学校开支的百分之四。而同时，军费预算则达一百八十亿美元，为教育经费的七十二倍。在美国有六百万儿童和少年，即六分之一的学龄儿童连初等学校都进不了。
    在日本，美国占领当局并没有重建教育制度，也没有肃清军国主义文化。在意大利，反动派的走卒在美国占领当局的积极援助之下，独霸了教育部及各地方教育机关。梵蒂岗的走狗统治着意大利教师团体，不给教师团体抗议现存局势的机会。
    杨氏继指出：法国提供了教师与工人阶级合作的杰出的范例。进步的法国教师，曾作为法国总工会领导下的工人阶级的一支有组织的队伍，参加了一九四七年年底的总罢工。
    杨氏在描述了苏联和人民民主国家教育事业的进步之后，论及中国教育的情形说：数百万人民解放军已成为对群众基本教育的学校。
    杨氏在结语中称：教育工作者职工部的目的，在于解决民主改革教育制度、改善教师生活水平和实现“同工同酬”原则等的重大任务。教育工作者面临着重大而崇高的任务——启蒙群众，以各国间友好的精神及忠于和平民主的精神，来教育全世界的青年。这个任务只有依靠广大劳动群众的支持才能解决。
