Actively Restore Municipal Construction
The Construction Bureau Achieves Remarkable Results in Half a Year, Saving Labor and Materials to Complete Multiple Projects

[Reported by this newspaper] Since taking over the pseudo-Public Works Bureau in February, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau has completed rectification and preliminary construction work. When taken over, the Construction Bureau's tools and equipment had been almost entirely destroyed and sold off by the bandit gang. The internal structure of the bureau was complex, with an overabundance of redundant staff. There were only forty-nine technical personnel, while administrative and miscellaneous staff numbered as many as eighty-three. The engineering team had five hundred people, but only over two hundred actually worked.

After the takeover, the first step was to carry out rectification work, streamlining the organization as much as possible. Old personnel were reviewed, screened, and dismissed, and new workers were recruited. In terms of materials, steamrollers and automobiles were repaired, increasing from two incomplete units each at the time of takeover to nine steamrollers and ten automobiles. The quarry in the Western Suburbs has been rebuilt from a dilapidated state. Engine rooms and warehouses have been repaired, narrow-gauge railways have been tidied up, twenty-two flatcars have been restored, stone crushers have been overhauled, and stone production, which had been stopped for a long time, has been resumed. To date, 3,900 cubic meters of stone have been produced. The stone used for the construction of the Yi-Xiang Highway was supplied by the stone factory. Usable materials were also recovered from scrap materials. For example, the twenty-one oil-boiling pots used in the construction of the Yi-Xiang Highway were all salvaged and repaired from scrap, saving approximately 1.4 million yuan in public funds.

The second step was to launch construction work. The projects completed from May to the end of June included: newly built and renovated asphalt, gravel, and other road surfaces totaling 152,979 square meters; 100 meters of new curbs and gutters; repaired eleven bridges and culverts; newly built and dredged wells, deep wells, and infiltration wells totaling 1,913 (39 newly built); newly built 205 meters of clay pipe trenches; and repaired and dredged 9,140 meters of open and covered ditches. In addition, the bureau assisted citizens in solving drainage projects, reconstructing and excavating 1,651 meters of open ditches, and constructing nine new test wells. At the same time, the bureau is carrying out the dredging of the 25.5-kilometer river channel water conservancy project from Yuquan Mountain to the city, which had been widely silted up before liberation. In coordination with the overall flood control work in North China, the bureau assisted in completing sixty sections of spring work, repairing five dams, laying 1,733 cubic meters of rubble, and leveling 6,952 meters of trenches and gullies; and assisted in summer flood control work by using a total of 20,000 cubic meters of earth to repair nearly 2,000 meters of river embankments. It also successfully tested the use of domestically produced asphalt for road construction, breaking the past notion that domestic asphalt was unsuitable and replacing imported products. More than 10,000 trees were planted. The bureau also assisted various agencies in surveying and designing house construction; and handled the registration of architects and construction companies. In addition, an urban planning committee was established. In addition to the above-mentioned tasks, by the end of August, another 24,000 square meters of cement and asphalt roads, which are currently under construction, and 2,190 meters of ditches will be completed.

The enthusiasm of the bureau's employees has been greatly enhanced, overcoming difficulties in financial and material resources to carry out construction work. In particular, the workers have demonstrated unparalleled enthusiasm. Technicians voluntarily participated in repair work and sorted out waste materials. Efforts were made to save fuel for steamrollers and automobiles. Coal consumption for steamrollers was reduced from 300 kg to 250 kg per day. Previously, gasoline consumption for automobiles was eight or nine kilometers per gallon, but now it has been increased to eleven or twelve kilometers. In total, steamrollers saved 8,000 kilograms of coal, and automobiles exceeded the previous mileage by more than 3,400 kilometers. In the past, an average of 0.8 man-days was required per square meter of fried oil pavement, but recent construction results have increased this to 0.5 man-days. Previously, it took at least twenty days for citizens to apply for construction permits, but now efforts are being made to complete them within three days.

　　积极恢复市政建设
  　建设局半年工作著成绩省工节料完成多项工程
    【本报讯】北平市人民政府建设局自二月接管伪工务局以来，到目前已完成整顿与初步的建设工作。接管时，建设局全局工具、器材已被匪帮破坏、恣卖殆尽。局内机构繁杂，冗员充斥，技术人员才四十九人，而行政与杂务人员多到八十三人；工程队五百人，而实际工作者仅二百余人。
    接管后，第一步进行整顿工作，机构方面尽力裁并。并审查、甄别、裁汰旧人员，吸收新工人。资材方面，修复汽碾、汽车、由接收时残破不全之各两部增加至汽碾九部、汽车十辆。西郊采石厂已从残破不堪中重新建起，修盖了机房库房，整理轻便铁路，修复平车二十二辆，整装碎石机，恢复了停止多时的石碴生产，到目前已生产石碴三千九百公方。此次兴筑颐香公路工程之石碴，即由石碴厂供给。并从残废器材中修复可用的，如此次修筑颐香公路所用的二十一口熬油锅，都是从废料中检出修好的，节省公款百四十万元左右。
    第二步展开了修建工作，自五月至六月底完成的工程计：新筑和翻修沥青、石碴等各种路面共十五万二千九百七十九平方公尺，添建道牙偏沟一百公尺，整修桥梁涵洞十一座，新建及掏挖沟井、深井、渗井共一千九百十三座（新建三十九座），新修缸管沟二百零五公尺，修理掏挖明暗沟九千一百四十公尺。此外，并协助市民解决排水工程，改建挑挖明沟千六百五十一公尺，新建探井九座。同时进行整顿由玉泉山至城内的解放前普遍淤塞的二五·五公里的河道水利工程。并配合华北全面防汛工作，在春工方面，协助完成春工六十段，补修坝五处，砌片石千七百三十三公方，平填战壕浪窝六千九百五十二公尺；协助夏季防汛中共用土二万公方，修河堤近两千公尺。又进行试验国产沥青筑路成功，打破过去本国沥青不适用的观念，代替了舶来品。又植树一万多株；并协助各机关修建房屋的勘查、设计；办理建筑师、营造厂登记。此外，成立了都市计划委员会。除上述各项工作外，于八月底尚可完成现正修筑的水泥及沥青路两万四千平方公尺，整修沟道二千一百九十公尺。
    局内职工的工作热情已大大提高，克服财力物力上的困难来，进行建设工作。尤其工人们更表现了无比的热情。技工们自动参加修理工作，整理废料。在汽碾、汽车燃料之消耗上力求节省。汽碾用煤由每天三百公斤减至二百五十公斤，以前汽油每加仑行驶八、九公里，现提高至十一、十二公里，总计汽碾节省用煤八千公斤，汽车超过过去行驶里程三千四百公里以上。过去每平方公尺炒油路面平均需○·八人工，最近施工成绩，已提高为○·五人工。从前市民申报工程执照至少要二十天，现在争取在三天内即可完毕。
