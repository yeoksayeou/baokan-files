　　Widespread Application of Soviet Scientific Experience
  　Romanian Agricultural Output Greatly Increases
    New Varieties of Barley, Maize, and Wheat are Growing on Tens of Thousands of Hectares
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd] According to a TASS dispatch from Bucharest: Romania has widely applied the experience of Soviet agricultural science, greatly increasing the country's agricultural output. Professor Virusa, one of the heads of the Romanian Agricultural Science Institute near Bucharest, recently told a TASS reporter that he had been working for a long time to apply the achievements of Soviet scientists in spring sowing. He applied the achievements of the great Soviet scientist Michurin and his successor, Academician Lysenko, to Romanian agriculture. Professor Virusa stated that in 1946, in the village of Jimbolia (western Romania), the winter wheat crop was saved by utilizing the experience of Soviet scientists, guaranteeing the harvest of winter wheat on an area of 250 hectares. Professor Virusa stated that by adopting the spring sowing methods of Soviet scientists, the institute's personnel obtained better harvests at the experimental farm near the city of Timisoara. Last year, the harvest volume of farmland using this sowing method increased by an average of 15 percent compared to general yields. This year, the experience of artificial pollination of sunflowers and maize in the Soviet Union will be adopted in Romania. People at the scientific institutes of the People's Republic of Romania, by introducing the achievements of advanced Soviet agricultural science, are helping the Romanian people to improve their country's agriculture.
    Professor Virusa, in describing that Romanian scientists only obtained the possibility of real scientific research under the people's democratic regime, pointed out: Although our institute has a long history, it has only now developed real scientific research. The government gives us great assistance. Now, there are thirty-one experimental stations across the country, with a total land area of 13,000 hectares. The institute grows and cultivates new varieties of grains and other crops. New varieties of barley, maize, and wheat are already growing on tens of thousands of hectares of land. Now, the task we face is to supply the newly established collective farms with excellent seeds.

　　广泛应用苏联科学经验
  　罗农业产量大增
    大麦玉蜀黍和小麦的新品种已在成千成万顷土地上生长
    【新华社北平廿三日电】据塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚广泛应用苏联农业科学的经验，并使罗国农业产量大增。位于布加勒斯特近郊的罗马尼亚农业科学研究所部主任之一维鲁萨教授，顷告塔斯社记者称：他曾经长时间地进行工作，以应用苏联科学家在春季播种方面的成就。他把伟大的苏联科学家米丘林及其后继者科学院会员李森科的成就，应用于罗马尼亚农业上。维鲁萨教授称：一九四六年在吉姆勃利亚村（罗马尼亚西部），由于利用苏联科学家的经验，拯救了冬季小麦作物，并保证二五○公顷面积的冬季小麦的收获。维鲁萨教授称：由于采用了苏联科学家的春季播种的方法，研究所人员在迪米索拉城附近的实验场上，获得了更好的收获。去年运用这种播种方法的农田的收获量，平均较一般的产量增加百分之十五。今年，苏联的向日葵和玉蜀黍的人工授粉的经验，将在罗马尼亚采用。把先进的苏联农业科学的成就，介绍到罗马尼亚人民共和国科学研究所的人们，正帮助罗马尼亚人民来改进罗国的农业。
    维鲁萨教授在叙述罗国科学家只有在人民民主政权下才获得真正科学研究的可能性时指出：我们的研究所虽有了长期的历史，但只有在现在，才发展了真正的科学研究。政府给予我们以巨大的援助，现在，全国有三十一所实验站，实验站的土地总面积为一万三千公顷。研究所生长着并培育出新的谷物和其他作物品种。大麦、玉蜀黍和小麦的新品种，已在成千成万顷的土地上生长。现在，我们面临的任务是要供给新建立的集体农场以优良的种子。
