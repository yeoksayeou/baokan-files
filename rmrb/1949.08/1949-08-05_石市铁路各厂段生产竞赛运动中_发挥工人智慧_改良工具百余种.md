(Shijiazhuang Electric Dispatch) During the production competition in May and June, the various factories and sections under the Shijiazhuang Office of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau and the Shijiazhuang Machine Factory, the staff encouraged each other and helped each other, creating and improving more than 100 kinds of tools and supplies. Among the more important ones, Nian Sen, a construction worker from the Machine Factory, successfully trial-produced long taps with the assistance of the central tool room, solving the problem of the factory consuming 1,700 screws. In the trial production, he gained new experience in the use of machines, which would allow him to imitate and manufacture simple threading lathes. In the future, the amount of screws used in the entire railway section and various factories can be supplied in large quantities. Zhang Fengqi, a young worker in the forging workshop of the factory, created a kind of nozzle when making air pipe clips, which increased the output by 100%, and the products are more in line with the regulations than in the past. Yao Dayou, a worker in the locomotive depot, carefully studied and created a seat sleeve for repairing the spring columns of locomotives, changing the previous working method of repeatedly lifting the machine several times during repair, saving half the man-hours. Lu Jinrui, a young worker in the central tool room of the tool machine factory, spent more than ten days researching, repairing, and improving the fuel injectors that some technicians had failed to repair during the enemy and puppet period. This reduced the labor force by three times compared with the factory's previous manual painting. Ji Gengsheng, a 76-year-old "February 7th" veteran worker, improved the length of the air hammer core, which increased the power of the air hammer and ensured the early completion of the factory's riveting operations. According to the workers in the cold working group of the furnace workshop: "The ability to exceed the eight-hole task of bridge operations and complete thirteen holes is mainly due to the improvement of the air hammer." Liang Guishan, Zheng Fushun, Yang Lin, and other workers jointly researched and improved the smoke pipe descaling machine. The inspectors improved the hidden amount of grease, changing the original 30% cottonseed oil and 70% sesame oil to 50% each. It is more suitable for use than before, and the cotton yarn roll is not easy to scatter. In the 50-day competition, 2,321 kilograms of oil and 418 kilograms of cotton yarn were saved. Liu Shuangfa and Pei Shuzhi, workers in the section, created the first and second pressing machines for round opening locks, increasing the number of locks made per person per day by nearly six times compared with the previous 90. Chen Chouzi and Wang Jufu of the construction section created a model and a splitting anvil when making anti-creeping devices, increasing the output quality by more than three times. When improving and creating these tools and supplies, the workers constantly overcame the obstacles of old ideas and achieved these brilliant results. As the workers in various factories and sections said: Now the railway is in the hands of the people, of course we have to use our brains more and work harder.

    石市铁路各厂段生产竞赛运动中
    发挥工人智慧
    改良工具百余种
    【石家庄电】太原铁路局石家庄办事处所辖各厂段及石家庄机厂，在五、六月份生产竞赛中，职工开动脑筋，互相鼓励，互相帮助，创造与改进工具和用品达百余种。其中较重要的如机厂工务员年森，在总工具室的协助下，试制长板牙获得成功，解决了该厂毗口一千七百余条螺丝的耗用，并在试制中对机器的使用有了新的经验，从而可以仿造简单的套丝床。全路段与各工厂的螺丝用量，今后即可大量供应。该厂锻工所青年工友张风歧，在打风管卡子时创造一种喷子，使产量提高百分之百，产品也较过去更合规矩。机务段工友姚大右仔细精研，创造了一具修理机车弹簧立柱套用的座套，改变以前修理时起立机往复落数次的工作方法，前后节省一半的工时。工具机厂总工具室青年工友芦金瑞经十多天研究，修理并改进了敌伪时期好些技术人员都没有修好的喷油器。较该厂过去用手刷油漆减少三倍的人工。七十六岁的“二七”老工友计根生，改进了风锤胆的长度，使风锤的力量加大，保证该厂铆工作业的提前完成。据制炉所冷作组的工友们说：“桥梁作业的能超过八孔任务，完成十三孔，风锤的改进是其中的主要原因。梁桂山、郑福顺、杨林等工友，共同研究改进了烟管子打锈机。检车的工友们改进了油脂的隐量，把旧有百分之三十的棉子油和百分之七十的麻子油改成为百分之五十。在使用上较前合适，且使棉纱卷不易散乱，五十天的竞赛中，省油二千三百二十一公斤，省棉纱四百十八公斤。该段工友刘双发、裴树智作成圆开口锁子第一、第二压札器，较以前每人每天作九十个增加几近六倍。工务段陈臭子、王聚福等在打防爬器时创造了一种模型和劈铁砧子，提高产质量三倍多。工友们在改进和创造这些工具用品时，不断战胜旧思想的阻碍，取得了这些辉煌的成绩。正如各厂段工友说：现在铁路是在人民手中了，咱们当然要多费脑筋，多卖气力了。
