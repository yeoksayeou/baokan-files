　　Rear Military and Civilians Fully Support
  　Northwest Our Army Has Sufficient Supplies
    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 15th. Reporter Leng Feng reports: The hundreds of thousands of People's Liberation Army soldiers advancing into the Northwest have received ample supplies from the military and civilians in the rear. Vehicles and livestock loaded with grain and ammunition are steadily heading towards the front lines along the various transportation arteries leading west. Railway employees and the employees of the First Field Army Logistics Department's motor vehicle brigade are tirelessly driving trains and trucks day and night, rushing to the front lines. Workers of the motor vehicle brigade, responding to the call from the brigade leaders at the pre-battle mobilization meeting to "cherish ammunition, deliver it on time, and deliver it wherever we fight," transported 300,000 jin of flour and ammunition from 100 kilometers away to the front lines in 20 hours. All personnel of the Transportation Department's Eighth Station, personnel of the Ordnance Department's storage section, and soldiers of the guard platoon, worked with local residents to carry out intense handling operations, unloading 238,000 jin of ammunition from the train in two days and two nights. Staff members of the Transportation Department headquarters and soldiers of the Logistics 27th Company loaded 180,000 jin of ammunition onto vehicles in six hours. The people in the rear contributed infinite manpower and resources to the war. Among them were Shaanxi migrant workers who had traveled from 2,000 li away, and farmers from central Shaanxi who had only recently been liberated. They drove carts, pulled livestock, and carried stretchers. Countless people, countless vehicles, and countless livestock marched in the rolling yellow dust. In Fengxiang County, a newly liberated area, the young and strong went to the front lines to participate in war service, while the women ground flour for the front at home. The more than 30 households in Tangzizhuang ground 1,200 jin of flour in one day. Three elderly people in a village in Zhifang District personally carried more than 200 jin of flour they had ground to the front lines of ＠yang. The migrant workers in Gongzhen, Baoji County, drove more than 200 donkeys, ＠ing flour, and transported it to the front lines at a rate of 130 li per day.
