　　People's Bank of China Shanghai Branch
  　Starts Handling Inter-port Advances
    Bank of China Opens Export Loans
    [Shanghai People's Radio Broadcast, 28th] With the active promotion and support of the People's Government, inter-port trade between Shanghai and other regions is becoming increasingly active. The People's Bank of China in Shanghai has negotiated with the People's Banks of ten major cities, including Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Hangzhou, Tunxi, Nanjing, Wuxi, and Wuhu, to initially launch inter-port advance business. The target of inter-port advances is primarily to support the purchase of agricultural raw materials for industries such as cotton textiles coming to Shanghai, and the distribution of industrial products to rural areas. The bank has decided to handle this business in a planned manner in September.
    Currently, in order to enable manufacturers to obtain low-interest working capital, the bank has already started piloting this business. On the 19th of this month, the bank provided a 10 million RMB advance to China Standard Pencil Company for 30,000 gross of "Airplane Brand" pencils transported by train to Tianjin, with a term of 20 days. As a result, the factory's pencils arrived in Tianjin one week later, ten days earlier than expected; and on the 29th, the advance was fully repaid. In addition, the Bank of China has begun to offer export loans for fourteen major export commodities, including tung oil, bristles, tea, raw silk, cotton textiles, top hats, straw braid, miscellaneous grains, cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, wheat, flour, and salt. These loans include packaging loans, inter-port advances, fixed-term mortgage loans, and real-value loans.

    【上海人民电台二十八日广播】上海与各地埠际贸易，在人民政府积极推动与扶助下，公私营贸易日渐活跃。现本市人民银行与北平、天津、济南、西安、郑州、杭州、屯溪、南京、无锡、芜湖等十大城市人民银行洽妥，先行开办埠际押汇业务。埠际押汇扶助对象先以棉纺织等工业采购农产原料来沪及工业品下乡。该行决定在九月份将有计划地办理这一项业务。
    目前该行为使厂商获得低利资金周转，业已着手试办该项业务。本月十九日，该行曾给中国标准铅笔公司由火车运往天津的飞机牌铅笔三万罗，押汇人民币一千万元，定期二十天，该厂之铅笔因之一星期便运抵天津，提早了十天；并于二十九日将押汇如数收清。此外，中国银行就主要的出口物资：桐油、猪鬃、茶叶、生丝、棉织品、礼帽、草帽辫、杂粮、棉花、棉纱、棉布、小麦、面粉、食盐等十四种已开始办理出口贷款，包括：打包放款、埠际押汇、定期抵押放款、折实贷款等。
