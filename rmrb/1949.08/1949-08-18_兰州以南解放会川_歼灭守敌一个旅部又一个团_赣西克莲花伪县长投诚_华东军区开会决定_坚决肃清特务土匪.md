The puppet county magistrate led more than 100 members of the security team to surrender to the People's Liberation Army.

Nanjing People's Radio Station, 17th broadcast: In order to eliminate the Kuomintang special agents and bandit armed forces, unify the anti-banditry guidelines, steps, and policies, and exchange anti-banditry experience, the East China Military Region held a regional anti-banditry work conference starting from the 6th of this month. The meeting lasted for six days. In May, June, and July, a total of more than 25,000 bandits and special agents were annihilated, and more than 10,000 long and short guns and more than 600 light and heavy machine guns were seized. Comrade Yuan Zhongxian of the East China Military Region, Comrade Tang Liang, Director of the Political Department, and Comrade Zhang Kai, Deputy Director, gave special reports on anti-banditry tasks, policies, and tactics respectively. Everyone agreed that in the anti-banditry work, we must oppose complacency and purely military viewpoints. The meeting determined the future anti-banditry work policy: to focus on political offensives, combined with military suppression, and to mobilize the masses to carry out anti-banditry jointly. The troops should address the concerns of the masses, clearly announce and explain the policies of our Party, and expose all the rumors and deceptions of the bandits and special agents. The meeting made thorough studies and arrangements for all major tasks in anti-banditry, and successfully closed on the 11th.
