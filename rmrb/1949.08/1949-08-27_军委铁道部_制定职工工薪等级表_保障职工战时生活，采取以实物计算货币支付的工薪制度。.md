  　Formulates Employee Salary Grade Table
    Implement a Salary System Calculated in Kind and Paid in Currency to Ensure Employees' Wartime Livelihood

    [This Newspaper's Report] In order to ensure employees' wartime livelihood, to make railway salary treatment generally fair and consistent, and to implement the spirit of "pay according to labor" and improve production efficiency, the Military Commission Railway Department, with reference to the "North China Financial and Economic Committee's Provisional Measures for Employee Salaries" and based on the actual situation of the railways, has formulated a "Railway Employee Salary Grade Table." It has been implemented on a trial basis in the Railway Department and its directly affiliated departments, and the Pingjin Railway Administration since June of this year. The salary grade table is divided into thirteen grades with thirty-nine levels. To prevent employees' actual income from being greatly affected by wartime price fluctuations, a salary system calculated in kind and paid in currency is adopted. The "fen" is used as the unit of calculation. Each "fen" contains 1.22 jin of millet, accounting for slightly less than 68%; 0.18 chi of Wufu cloth, accounting for 18%; 0.02 jin of sesame oil, accounting for slightly more than 4%; 0.03 jin of edible salt, accounting for slightly less than 1%; and 4.5 jin of raw coal, accounting for slightly more than 9%. The highest level, Level 1 of Grade 1, is 800 "fen," approximately equivalent to 1600 jin of millet. The lowest level, Level 39 of Grade 13, is 100 "fen," approximately equivalent to 200 jin of millet. Before the government promulgates unified salary payment methods, each region will temporarily establish a committee of three to five people from the personnel, finance, and labor union departments each month and at the end of each month, based on local prices, to determine the value of the "fen." The value will be announced after being approved by the Railway Department's departmental meeting or the Railway Administration's administrative meeting. Each region should also organize supply stores and cooperatives to provide employees with necessities of life at prices close to the "fen" value.

    Job assignments and salary evaluations began on the 25th of this month. The Railway Department and the Pingjin Railway Administration have established job assignment and salary evaluation committees and sub-committees to implement organized and guided democratic evaluation. To enable employees to more deeply understand the significance of the new salary grade table and democratic evaluation, Ma Jian, Director of the Personnel Bureau of the Railway Department, gave a report to all employees in the auditorium of the Railway Department at 3:00 PM on the 25th. When determining employee titles and evaluating employee salary levels, the standards for management personnel are planning, organization, and management capabilities. Salary evaluation should also be based on the size of responsibilities. The standards for technical personnel are their technical knowledge and practical abilities. The main standards for general staff (clerks) are their working ability and proficiency. The main standards for technical workers are their technical operational ability and proficiency. The main standard for simple manual laborers is the intensity of their labor. Factors such as work attitude and length of service will also be considered. (People's Railway News Agency)

　　军委铁道部
  　制定职工工薪等级表
    保障职工战时生活，采取以实物计算货币支付的工薪制度。
    【本报讯】为了保障职工战时生活，使铁路的工薪待遇大体公允一致，并为了贯彻按劳给酬，提高生产效率之精神，军委铁道部特参照华北财委会职工薪资暂行办法，并根据铁路实际情况，制订铁路职工工薪等级表，自本年六月份起在铁道部及直属各部门与平津铁路管理局开始试行。该工薪等级表共分十三等三十九级。为了使职工实际所得工薪不致因战时物价波动而受到很大影响计，特采取以实物计算货币支付的工薪制度。以“分”为计算单位，每分的含量为小米一点二二斤，占百分之六十八弱；五福布零点一八尺，占百分之十八；香油零点零二斤，占百分之四强；食盐零点零三斤，占百分之一弱；原煤四点五斤，占百分之九强。最高一等一级得八百分，约相当一千六百斤小米。最低十三等三十九级得一百分，约相当二百斤小米。在政府尚未颁布统一的工薪支付办法前，暂由各地区于每月中及月底根据当地物价，由人事、财务、工会三方面成立三至五人之委员会制定“分”值，经由铁道部部务会议或管理局局务会议批准后公布。各地区并应组织供给商店及合作社供给职工近似“分”值之生活必需品。
    自本月二十五日起开始定职评薪。铁道部及平津局均成立定职评薪委员会及分会。实行有组织有领导的民主评定。为使职工更深入认识新工薪等级表及民主评定的意义，铁道部人事局马健局长特于二十五日下午三时在铁道部大礼堂向全体职工作报告。确定职工职称及评定职工工薪等级时，管理人员以计划、组织与管理能力为标准，评薪时并应依据职责大小，技术人员以其技术知识及实际能力为标准，一般工作人员（职员）以其工作能力与熟练程度为主，技术工人以其技术作业能力与熟练程度为主，单纯体力劳动者以其劳动强度为主，再参照工作态度好坏及工龄长短等条件来评定。（人民铁道报社）
