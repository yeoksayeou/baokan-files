Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: Comprehensive reports: Britain, whose dollar crisis has been exacerbated by the Marshall Plan, is still begging the United States for aid despite serious conflicts with the United States. On July 23, the British government submitted a secret note to the so-called "European Economic Cooperation Administration" implementing the Marshall Plan, requesting an additional $624 million in Marshall Plan funding for Britain to make up for its dollar deficit, which greatly exceeded its previous estimates. According to a British Treasury spokesman on July 26, it is estimated that the British dollar deficit will reach $1.547 billion in the year from July 1 this year to June 30 next year. It is impossible for the British government to continue to rely on the United States to save its crisis. The bosses on Wall Street are not so generous, and even if they give a little money, they will certainly require Britain to agree to more stringent conditions, which will cause Britain to suffer even worse consequences. Not long ago, based on the then lower estimate of the dollar deficit, Britain requested $1.114 billion in funding from the United States, but the so-called "Economic Cooperation Administration" only agreed to allocate $923 million to Britain out of the total $4.5 billion in Marshall Plan funding for Europe passed by the US Congress. Now, the US Senate Appropriations Committee has reduced the $4.5 billion in European aid previously approved by Congress to $3.7 billion, which is currently under reconsideration by Congress. According to "Economic Cooperation Administration" Director Hoffman on July 27: If Congress passes this reduction, the funding for Britain will be further reduced to $840 million. Not only that, but the United States is trying to take advantage of the situation to further coerce Britain into becoming a sacrifice to delay its economic crisis. According to a TASS dispatch on July 30, citing US newspapers, a powerful group of American "entrepreneurs" and congressional groups, led by American banker Aldrich, are launching a movement to suspend or reduce Marshall Plan funding for Britain. The purpose of this movement is to pressure the British government to abandon its economic policy of resisting American goods and to devalue the pound.
Britain's request for increased funding has already caused conflict with other Western European countries that are also vying to beg the United States. The Associated Press described Britain's request for increased funding as "exploding like a bomb among other countries" because they fear that if Britain's request is granted, the funding they receive will be reduced. Italian Budget Minister Bertone has made it clear that he will resolutely oppose it.

    英帝美元荒越来越严重
    自投罗网续向美帝乞援
    【新华社北平七日电】综合报道：因马歇尔计划而美元危机日趋严重的英国，虽与美国发生了严重的矛盾，但却仍向美国乞援。七月二十三日，英国政府向执行马歇尔计划的所谓“欧洲经济合作局”提出秘密照会，要求再增加马歇尔计划对英拨款六亿二千四百万美元，以弥补其大大超出其先前估计的美元亏空。据英国财政部发言人七月二十六日宣称，估计自今年七月一日至明年六月三十日一年内，英国美元亏空将达十五亿四千七百万美元。英国政府想继续依靠美国来挽救其危机是行不通的。华尔街的老板并不那么慷慨，即使能给一点钱，也必定要英国答应更苛刻的条件，这就将使英国遭受更坏的恶果。不久以前，英国根据当时较低的美元亏空的估计，曾要求美国拨款十一亿一千四百万美元，但所谓“经合总署”却仅应允在美国国会通过的全部四十五亿美元的马歇尔计划对欧拨款中，分配与英国九亿二千三百万美元。现在美国参院拨款委员会又把国会以前通过的四十五亿美元对欧拨款，削减至三十七亿美元，正交国会复议中。据“经合总署”署长霍夫曼七月二十七日宣称：如果国会通过此项削减，则对英拨款就将再削减至八亿四千万元。不仅如此，美国正企图乘人之危，进一步胁迫英国充当延缓其经济危机的牺牲品。据塔斯社七月三十日电引美国报纸报道，由美国银行家阿德里奇为首的美国有势力的“企业家”及国会集团，正发起一个运动，如不能中止亦要削减马歇尔计划对英拨款。这一运动的目的，在于压迫英国政府放弃抵制美货的经济政策和将英镑贬值。
    英国这一增加拨款的要求，已引起与同样继续向美国争相乞讨的其他西欧国家的冲突。美联社把英国之请求增加拨款描写成“象一枚炸弹一样的在其他国家间爆炸开来”。因为它们害怕英国的要求一旦获准，则它们得到的拨款就会减少。意大利预算部长伯托尼已明白声明将坚决予以反对。
