Among Comrades
Ya Qun

I.

Because of his child's frequent illnesses, Lao Wang gradually became acquainted with Doctor Qin, a pediatrician at the Central Hospital's outpatient department.

"Where's the child's mother? Why do you always bring the child in for treatment?"

It was one time when the child had diarrhea and a high fever, leading to convulsions, and he had to get an emergency number. After Doctor Qin diagnosed that there was no danger, Lao Wang breathed a sigh of relief, and Doctor Qin asked him with concern.

He shook his head, determined not to say, but somehow finally told the truth:

"The mother was left in the Kuomintang-controlled area. She's living a life of escape with an even smaller child, I don't know if she's been killed by the Kuomintang!"

He thought that saying this might make the doctor examine the child's illness more carefully, or have some other more concerned reaction, but the other party, with a doctor's characteristic calmness, said nothing, until after writing the prescription and explaining the method of administration, Lao Wang bid him farewell, and he gently touched the little face of the child lying in the basket again, and still very calmly said:

"It's not easy for a man to take care of a child, so—" he paused and said: "So in the future, if the child is sick, you can come anytime, not necessarily according to the prescribed time."

Lao Wang was so moved that he couldn't speak, and could only shake his hand again. Since becoming a "mother," he had an unspeakable feeling that had not been understood by anyone. He sometimes secretly regretted not being considerate enough of the child's mother in the past, and sometimes being too demanding of her. Moreover, because of this, his views on the "mother comrades" in the organization were also different. He hoped that in the future, after defeating Chiang Kai-shek and liberating the whole country, when they reunited, he would tell her this feeling as if he were writing a novel... The best thing would be if the child didn't die, and he could hand the child over to the mother in person, as one of his accomplishments since their separation, to boast to her, because when they were together, she didn't trust him to take care of the child, and often said: "If you take care of the child alone, you will definitely kill him..." But, the child often got sick, which was really worrying! Today, the doctor giving him this special convenience greatly guaranteed these hopes. When he returned to the organization, he almost proudly and congratulatingly said to every "mother comrade" as if it were for his child:

"Doctor Qin told me that Dan'er can see him anytime if he's sick, and doesn't have to wait for the outpatient hours on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays."

II.

About a month later, it was Saturday night, and the child had diarrhea again! Although he didn't have a fever, he was always a little scared, especially when he thought of the previous convulsions, he was very afraid! During the night, the child had diarrhea three times, and he touched the child's forehead at least twenty times. Every time he touched it and there was no fever, he could only close his eyes in peace.

At dawn, the child had diarrhea again, but still got off the bed to play, nothing seemed wrong, but he always reminded himself, "What if it drags on until tomorrow and he gets a fever?" After breakfast, he decided to take the child to see Doctor Qin today, Sunday.

Doctor Qin was giving a current affairs lesson to a large group of service personnel in a courtyard to the left of the outpatient department. Lao Wang greeted him with the child in his arms, and then went to the outpatient department to wait for a consultation, while Doctor Qin quickly came in his work clothes, holding a diagnostic instrument.

"Sick again?" Doctor Qin touched the child's little face and asked them to go to the examination room. As usual: taking temperature, listening to the chest, pressing the stomach... Afterwards, he coldly asked, "How is it?"

"Diarrhea again."

"When did the diarrhea start?"

"Last night."

"How many times so far?"

"Five times."

"Anything else?"

"Nothing."

"Why didn't you come during the outpatient hours?" Suddenly, Doctor Qin became angry: "What day is today? Why not come tomorrow?" The white-rimmed glasses flashed with questioning light.

Lao Wang was a little embarrassed, but still smiled apologetically and said:

"There's no one else to take care of him, and tomorrow I have an important meeting to attend." He felt that this explanation was more appropriate, and it was also true that he had a meeting to attend tomorrow morning.

"Your organization has definite work, doesn't any other organization have definite work?" The white-rimmed glasses still flashed with questioning light.

Lao Wang didn't want to say anything more, but finally, embarrassed and smiling, he reminded the other party:

"Because you said last time that this child can come at any time, regardless of the prescribed time?" His voice was kept as low and peaceful as possible, to prevent the tone from becoming a "counterattack."

"That's for emergencies!" The doctor still righteously rebuked: "Like this little bit of ordinary diarrhea, and the temperature is normal! Don't you think: We only have this little study time on Sundays? I thought the child had a critical illness, and I ran over before finishing the lesson..."

Lao Wang also seemed to feel that his reasons were not quite right, but he always thought: "You said it yourself!" He felt that he had received undue blame, but he didn't want to say anything more, pretending to be very natural, he took the prescription and walked out with the child. Doctor Qin also ran back to the courtyard where he was teaching, angrily.

"This is also my own fault!" On the way, Lao Wang explained to himself: "Treating someone else's accidental, momentary emotional words as a regular basis for handling things will naturally hit a wall."

He was still full of grievances. When he returned to the organization and saw the "mother comrades," he unusually didn't say a word.

III.

The child took the medicine three times according to the prescribed time, and only had diarrhea once that night, and did not have a fever. The next day, a "mother comrade" was taking her child to the outpatient department, and Lao Wang asked her to take a letter to Doctor Qin: "Doctor Comrade:

I was unhappy at the time about your criticism of me yesterday, but after thinking about it, I should take the main responsibility. Although you gave me special consideration because you understood my difficulties, and said that the child could see a doctor at any time when he was sick, I should have considered whether it was necessary, and should not have considered the problem solely from my own convenience. The system belongs to everyone, and everyone should abide by it. It was wrong to disrupt your work order yesterday with something that wasn't an emergency."

The "mother comrade" returned that day and said: "As soon as Doctor Qin saw me today, he asked if your child was better, and asked why you didn't bring the child to see him again today?" I asked her if the letter had been delivered? What did he say after reading it? The "mother comrade" said that the letter was delivered in person, but he was busy with diagnosis and treatment, and put it in his pocket without reading it yet.

On Wednesday, another "mother comrade" went to the outpatient department, and Doctor Qin asked her to bring a letter and a dose of medicine to Lao Wang. The letter read:

"Comrade Lao Wang:

Is the child's illness better? If he still has diarrhea, but no other symptoms, continue to take this medicine; if he no longer has diarrhea, then don't take it; and if the child has a fever, bring him to the outpatient department early tomorrow morning.

Greetings! Qin Wednesday"

    一
    因了孩子的时常生病，老王渐渐地和中央医院门诊部的儿科医生秦同志熟识了。
    “孩子的妈妈呢？怎么老是你带孩子来看病？”
    是一次，孩子因拉肚子而发高烧，以至于痉挛，挂急诊号，经秦医生诊断，认为没有危险，老王吐了一口大气之后，秦医生很关切地问他。
    他摇摇头，决心不说，但不知怎么终于又照实说了：
    “妈妈丢在国统区了。还带有一个更小的孩子过着逃亡生活，不知道被国民党杀掉没有！”
    他觉得这样说了，也许医生同志对孩子的病会诊断得更仔细些，或者有其他更关切的反映，可是对方以医生特有的冷静，没有说什么，直到把处方写好，服法交代清楚，老王和他告别，他才重摸一摸躺在篮子里的孩子的小脸，依然很冷静地说：
    “男人带小孩可不容易，那末——”他顿了一下又说：“那末以后孩子病了，随时都可以来，不一定照规定时间。”
    老王感动地说不出话，只得再和他握一握手。他自从兼任妈妈以来，有一种说不出的心情，没有被人体会过，他只有时暗自懊悔过去对孩子的妈妈的心情体念得不够，有时对她太苛求了。而且，因此，他对机关里的妈妈同志们看法也有不同。他希望将来把蒋介石打垮，全国解放后，会聚的时候，把这心情象写小说一样的告诉她……。最好，孩子不要死掉，当面交给妈妈，作为别来自己的劳绩之一，向她夸耀一番，因为在一块儿的时候，她是不放心他带孩子的，常常说：“假如孩子给你一人带，一定会给你弄死…”，但，偏偏孩子又常生病，真急人！今天医生同志这样给他以特别方便，他这些希望得到极大的保证了。他回到机关里，差不多看见每一个妈妈同志都骄傲而又替孩子庆贺似地说：
    “秦医生叫我丹儿有病随时都可以去看，不一定要等到一、二、五的门诊时间了。”
    二
    约莫过了一个多月，是星期六的晚上，孩子又拉肚子了！虽然并没有发烧，但他总有些怕，尤其想到前次痉挛的情形，他怕的很！一夜，孩子拉了三次，他至少摸了孩子的额部二十次，一摸没有发烧，他又才放心的合一次眼。
    天亮了，孩子又拉一次，但仍然下炕去玩，没有什么，但他总是“万一拖到明天，又发烧呢？”这样提醒自己。早饭后，他决定趁今天星期日，带孩子去找秦医生。
    秦医生正在门诊部左边的一个院子里给一大堆勤杂人员上时事课，老王抱着孩子和他打个招呼，便到门诊部去候诊，而秦医生也很快就穿着工作服，拿着诊断器来了。
    “又病了吗？”秦医生摸一摸孩子的小脸，便叫他们到诊断室去。照例：考温度，听胸脯，按摸肚皮……，之后，冷冷地问：“怎么样？”
    “又拉肚子。”
    “什么时候开始拉？”
    “昨天晚上。”
    “到现在拉过几次？”
    “五次。”
    “还有什么？”
    “没有什么。”
    “怎么不按门诊时间来？”突如其来地，秦医生发火了：“今天是星期几？怎么不明天来？”白框眼镜里闪着责问的光芒。
    老王有些窘，但仍然带笑而抱歉地说：
    “没有多的人照管，明天我又有必要的会要参加。”他觉得这样解释比较适宜，而明天上午要开会也是事实。
    “你机关里有一定的工作，别人机关里就没有一定的工作？”白框眼镜里仍然闪着责问的光芒。
    老王想不再说什么，但终于带窘带笑，提醒对方似地说：
    “因为你前次说过，这孩子可以不照规定时间来？”声音尽量放得低和，防止语气成了“反攻”。
    “那是要有急病呀！”医生仍然理直气壮地责难：“象这样一点普通的拉肚子，温度也正常！你不想：我们就只有星期日这点学习时间？我以为孩子又得急症了，课都未上完就跑了来……”
    老王似乎也觉得自己的理由不大对，但总觉得：“你自己说过的话呀！”认为自己受了不应受的责难，但也不愿再说下去了，装着很自然地样子取着处方笺，带着孩子走出门。秦医生也气冲冲地跑回原来上课的院子去了。
    “这也要怪自己！”在路上，老王自己解释：“把别人偶然的，一刹那间的情感支配的话，当作正规的根据来处理事情，自然会碰钉子。”
    他仍然是一肚子的委曲。回到机关里见着妈妈同志们，破例的一声不响。
    三
    孩子按规定时间服过三次药，当天晚上已只拉一次，也未发烧。第二天有妈妈同志要带孩子到门诊部去，老王请她带封信给秦医生：“医生同志：
        您昨天对我的批评，我当时虽不愉快，但过后想来，我要负主要责任。虽是您因了体念我的困难，特别关照我，说过孩子病了可以随时就诊的话，但在我这方面，就应考虑有无必要，不应专从自己这方面的便当出发来考虑问题。制度是大家的，应当大家遵守才好。象昨天那样本不是急病，而打乱你的工作秩序，是不应该的。”
    妈妈同志当天回来说：“人家秦医生今天一看见我就问你的孩子好些没有，问你今天怎么不再带孩子去看？”我问她信交到没有？他看后说什么？妈妈同志说，信是当面交的，不过他忙于诊病，塞在袋子里还未看哩。
    星期三又有妈妈同志到门诊部去，秦医生托她带一封信和一剂药给老王。信上写着：
    “老王同志：
    孩子的病好了没有？假如还拉肚子，又无别的征兆，仍然继续服这个药；假如已不拉了，就不要再服；又假如孩子发烧，明天一早即带他来门诊部
    敬礼！        秦  星期三”
