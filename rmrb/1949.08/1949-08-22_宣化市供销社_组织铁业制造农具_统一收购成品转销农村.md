　　【Xuanhua News】In order to support the iron industry production in Xuanhua City, the Xuanhua City Supply and Marketing Cooperative helped the city's iron industry organize guilds for pig iron and wrought iron at the end of last month, organizing and leading them to develop production in a planned manner. There are more than 20 wrought iron (blacksmith shops), each with mostly one furnace and two or three people, mainly manufacturing agricultural tools, horseshoe nails, shoe nails, etc., but because sales are limited to the city and its surroundings, the production volume is very small, and none of them are developed. After organizing, the first plan was to make sickles, and the products would be purchased uniformly by the supply and marketing cooperative, and then resold to the countryside for use during the autumn harvest. The product quality standards and prices are all determined uniformly by the households themselves after discussion. It is currently stipulated that each sickle will be priced at six kilograms of rice based on the market wholesale price, and payment will be received upon delivery. If there are real difficulties, they can temporarily borrow from the supply and marketing cooperative. The production quantity of each household is also determined by the households themselves based on their capabilities. It is estimated that the first batch (to be delivered by the end of August) will produce a total of 4,600 sickles. If households lack iron, the supply and marketing cooperative allows them to supply a portion, and if they lack coal, they can buy it from the supply and marketing cooperative at a price lower than the market price. As a result, the production enthusiasm of each household is extremely high, and more than 600 sickles have already been produced. After the sickle task is completed, hoes and picks will continue to be produced in large quantities, and agricultural production tools will be supplied to rural areas in a planned manner.
　　The pig iron guild has also organized seven households and is now investigating the styles of agricultural tools in counties lacking agricultural tools in order to manufacture them in large quantities.

　　宣化市供销社
  　组织铁业制造农具
  　统一收购成品转销农村
    【宣化讯】宣市供销社为了扶助该市铁业生产，于上月底帮助全市铁业组织了生铁和熟铁的行业公会，组织领导他们有计划的发展生产。熟铁（铁匠炉）共二十余家，每家多是一盘炉，两三个人，多制造农具、牲口掌、鞋钉等，但因销路只限本市及城周围，生产量很小，都不发达。组织起来后，先计划打镰刀，产品由供销社统一收购，然后转销农村，以供秋收时使用。产品量质标准、价格，都由各户自己讨论后统一规定，现规定每把镰刀按市场批发价六斤米折款，交货时即取款，如实在困难，可暂向供销社支借。各户生产数量，也由各户根据自己的力量规定，计第一批（八月底交齐）预定共做四千六百把。各户如缺铁，供销社允许供给一部分，缺煤可到供销社低于市价去买。因之，各户生产情绪极高，现已生产出六百余把。镰刀任务完成后，继续大批生产锄和镐，有计划地供给农村生产用具。
    生铁公会也组织起七户，现正到农具缺乏各县去调查农具样式，以便大批制造。
