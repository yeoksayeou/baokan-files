Through Wall Posters, Collectively Study Writing; Central District Students Visit Factories

▲ On August 12th, Comrade Jing Helu of the Southwest District Youth Academy gave a lecture on "The Great Chairman Mao." During the lecture, everyone was very interested in Chairman Mao's study and life in his youth, and expressed infinite admiration for Chairman Mao's correct leadership of the revolution and his spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people. After the meeting, League members from various schools stated: They will work hard to strengthen their studies and serve their classmates in the future, and are determined to learn from Chairman Mao with actions and always be good students of Mao Zedong. (Publicity and Communications Group, Southwest District of the Academy)

▲ The Southwest District First Reading Room of the Youth Academy has added a new batch of books, including the recently published 52 kinds of the Chinese People's Literature and Art Series. Young students are flocking to browse the books and newspapers, eagerly absorbing new knowledge.

▲ In order to improve the level of the correspondents, the Publicity and Communications Section of the Southwest District of the Youth Academy has compiled the correspondents' manuscripts into a study wall newspaper. The correspondent students can write criticisms or suggestions on the back of the manuscripts, so that they can help each other learn.

▲ After listening to Comrade Gao Tang's report on the Communist Youth League, students in the Central District of the Academy generally launched chat sessions, discussion meetings, and forums to discuss why there should be a League? What is the difference between joining the League and not joining the League? Some students who want to apply to join the League also reported why they want to join the League. During the discussion, the work of the League branches in various schools and the style of the League members were reviewed. Some students reviewed the arrogance of individual League members and the past detachment of individual League branches from students, and some League members were busy all day after joining the League, which delayed their studies. The League branch and League members also accepted the criticisms and expressed their efforts to overcome the shortcomings. Many students felt that most League members were enthusiastic and active in their work and study, and were very eager to understand the League, and successively raised questions such as what kind of students can join the League and what procedures are required, and discussed and requested answers.

▲ Students from the Central District of the Academy will visit the Qinghe Woolen Mill today (14th) and hold a get-together with the workers.

▲ The Youth Lecture will invite Comrade Pan Liang on the morning of the 15th to answer "Questions about the League."

▲ In the Northwest District on the morning of the 12th, Comrade Ke Li gave a lecture on "Public Enemy of the People Chiang Kai-shek." In the afternoon, Comrade Helu gave a lecture on "Introducing Stories of the Communist Youth League." Because it was in the form of stories, the students were very interested in listening.

    ▲八月十二日西南区青年学园靖赫鲁同志讲“伟大的毛主席”。听讲中，大家对毛主席青年时代的学习和生活非常感觉兴趣，对毛主席正确的领导革命和全心全意为人民服务的精神表示无限钦佩。会后各校的团员们表示：今后努力加强学习，为同学服务，决心用行动来学习毛主席，永远作毛泽东的好学生。（学园西南区宣通组）
    ▲青年学园西南区第一阅览室，又增加了一批新书。其中包括最近出版的中国人民文艺丛书五十二种。青年同学们川流不息的来翻阅着书报，如饥如渴地吸吮着新的知识。
    ▲青年学园西南区宣传通讯股为了提高通讯员的水准，把通讯员的稿子组成一个学习壁报，通讯员同学们可以在稿子的后面写批评或建议，这样可以互相帮助学习。
    ▲学园中心区同学听了高棠同志关于青年团的报告以后，普遍展开漫谈会、讨论会、座谈会，讨论为什么要有团？入团与不入团有什么区别等许多问题。有些想申请入团的同学，也报告他为什么要入团。讨论中，联系各校团支部的工作，团员的作风，作了检讨。有的同学检讨个别团员自高自大，个别团支部过去脱离同学，有的团员入团后整天忙，耽误了功课。团支部、团员也接受了批评，表示努力克服缺点。很多同学觉得大部团员工作学习都很热心积极，非常想明了团，纷纷提出什么样的同学才能入团、经过什么手续等问题加以讨论并请求解答。
    ▲学园中心区同学于今（十四）日到清河制呢厂去参观，并与工友们举行联欢。
