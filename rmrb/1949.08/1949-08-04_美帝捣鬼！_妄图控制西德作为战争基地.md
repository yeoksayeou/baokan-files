Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, August 3rd: TASS Berlin dispatch: U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Bradley, Denfeld, and Vandenberg arrived in Frankfurt on July 30th. According to the German News Agency, the Chiefs of Staff and the U.S. "High Commissioner" to West Germany, McCloy, discussed West Germany's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty. According to sources within the U.S. and British control organizations, the discussions also involved the "possibility of turning certain places along the North Sea coast into American naval defense bases" and the establishment of American airfields. Western European political figures pointed out that the consultations between the Chiefs of Staff clearly demonstrate the purpose for which they are creating the division of Germany and the goal they are pursuing in establishing a separate West German state under their control. West Germany is bound to be used as a springboard and base for preparing a new war.
