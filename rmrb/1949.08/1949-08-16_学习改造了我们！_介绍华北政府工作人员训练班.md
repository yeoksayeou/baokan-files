　　Learning Transforms Us! Introducing the North China Government Workers Training Class

　　Learning transforms us! Every trainee who has undergone more than two months of study thinks of this sentence in their heart.

　　The trainees of the North China People's Government Workers Training Class are retained, probationary, and reserved personnel from various departments and directly affiliated units, totaling 4,356 trainees. Except for 861 workers from the post office, all are employees from the enemy and puppet eras, with a small number being old civil servants from the Beijing government era. The general level of education is very high, with university graduates and returned students accounting for more than 45% of the total, and there are also many technical talents. The vast majority are middle-aged, with those aged 30 to 45 accounting for three-quarters of the total. The family backgrounds of the trainees include landlords, bureaucrat capitalists, national capitalists, self-employed professionals, farmers, and workers, with the self-employed being the most numerous, accounting for about 31% of the total. Complex origins, different experiences, long-term service to the reactionary ruling class, and living an exploitative parasitic life have naturally given most trainees many backward and even reactionary ideological tendencies. On the other hand, because 80% of the trainees are staff members below the section level, they had no status under the rule of the reactionary regime, their lives were not guaranteed, and they suffered more or less from the oppression of the bureaucratic structure. They also had many dissatisfactions with the suffering brought to the people by the Kuomintang's reactionary rule. At the same time, because almost all trainees are intellectuals who have received secondary or higher education, they have some understanding of science and are willing to pursue the truth. Therefore, in today's situation of national revolutionary victory, the general trainees have the desire to progress, and with the continuous education of our Party in the future, they will gradually be transformed.

　　When the study began, most trainees did not understand our Party's policy towards intellectuals. Coupled with the long-term acceptance of the malicious propaganda of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, they had many misconceptions about studying. Some people thought that participating in the study was like forced training by the Japanese invaders, and they had no choice but to go; some people thought that receiving training was a way to find a way out; and most people held a perfunctory attitude, such as a trainee working in the Ministry of Education said: I have no choice but to work for others in order to live? Therefore, when the study began, the general mood was not high. On the day of the opening ceremony, some people said: The more you talk, the more headache you get. Some people adopted a perfunctory attitude in everything, dared not speak boldly during group discussions, adopted a tentative attitude towards our Party, and tried their best to emphasize difficulties in their lives.

　　After the leadership noticed these phenomena, it believed that in order to make everyone's study fruitful, it was necessary to first break through ideological concerns. Therefore, it focused on explaining our Party's various policies to everyone, especially citing many practical examples. In addition, everyone personally saw the strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army, and that the People's Government has always taken actively restoring and developing production as its central task. When dealing with them, they showed an open and aboveboard attitude, making them feel that they were not suspected in any way. In addition, the hard and simple style of the veteran cadres also gave them a great impact. This situation was quickly reversed. After more than two months, after studying the history of social development, methods of thinking, and the basic problems of the Chinese revolution, most trainees made significant progress. This began to clear up past old ideas and initially established a new outlook on life of serving the people. The following are some specific manifestations of progress:

　　First of all, it should be pointed out that most trainees have distinguished the boundaries between revolution and counter-revolution, and realized that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are essentially different. The People's Liberation War currently underway is not a struggle for power between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but a decisive battle between revolution and counter-revolution. For example, some said: I now know that only the Communist Party represents the interests of the people. Some said: After studying, I realized that we used to be accomplices of the four major families. There is also a preliminary understanding of the Soviet Union and the United States, such as someone said in retrospect: Now I know that the United States helped the Kuomintang with military weapons and fueled the Chinese civil war... Its conspiracy is a hundred times more sinister than Japan.

　　Many technical personnel used to believe that science is above class and that scientific workers can ignore politics. But today, they have abandoned this backward view. For example, most of the trainees in the training classes of the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Health, and the Academy of Agricultural Sciences clearly stated that science cannot be separated from politics and that there is no third way to go.

　　There is a preliminary understanding of the history of social development, and they have begun to recognize that the working people are the creators of history and have corrected the past mistaken idea of looking down on the working people.

　　They gradually understood our Party's policies and eliminated past concerns. In the past, they tried every means to conceal their history. Today, many people have realized the crimes against the people in the past and confessed to the leadership that they had participated in reactionary parties and groups. For example, after studying for a period of time in the Ministry of Education training class, 32 of the 40 trainees voluntarily confessed their experiences in participating in reactionary parties.

　　Finally, the work style has begun to change. The past work style of being domineering, perfunctory, corrupt, and degenerate has been criticized. The trainees of various departments have expressed their willingness to obey the organization's arrangements. Dozens of trainees assigned to water conservancy engineering teams and cotton production improvement offices voluntarily proposed to add night shifts in order to rush work. Most trainees are very serious about studying, subscribing to newspapers, buying reference books, and have begun to show a hard-working style in their lives. For example, trainees from some departments do not go home for lunch, but only eat some dry food they bring with them.

　　These achievements in learning prove the correctness of the CCP Central Committee's correct policy of educating and transforming intellectuals. In particular, Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" has solved many ideological problems for everyone. But everything is just beginning. The establishment of a firm and correct revolutionary outlook on life still requires long-term and arduous training!

　　学习改造了我们！　介绍华北政府工作人员训练班
    学习改造了我们！每一个经过两个多月学习的学员，在内心里都想着这样的一句话。
    华北人民政府工作人员训练班的学员，是各部和各直属单位留用、试用和留训的人员，共有学员四三五六名，除邮局有八六一名工人外，都是敌伪时代的职员，有少数是北京政府时代的老公务员。一般文化程度都很高，大学毕业和留学生占全数的百分之四十五以上，还有许多技术人材。其中绝大部分是中年人，三十岁到四十五岁的就占了全数的四分之三。学员的家庭成份有地主、官僚资本家、民族资本家、自由职业者、农民、工人等，其中以自由职业者的人数较多，约为全体学员的百分之三十一。出身的复杂，遭遇的不同，长期为反动的统治阶级服务，和过着剥削的寄生生活，这一切使大多数学员自然地带有许多落后的甚至反动的思想意识。但在另一方面，因为百分之八十的学员都是科员以下的职员，在反动的政权统治下，是没有地位的，生活也得不到保障，而且或多或少地受过官僚机构的压迫，对国民党反动统治带给人民的痛苦，有许多不满的地方；同时因为几乎所有学员都是知识分子，受过中等以上的教育，对科学有些认识，而愿意追求真理。因此，在今天全国革命胜利的形势下，一般学员都有进步的要求，今后在我党不断的教育下，是会逐渐加以改造的。
    当学习开始时，大多数学员不了解我党对待知识分子的政策，再加上长期接受了帝国主义和国民党反动派的恶毒宣传，对学习有许多错误的看法。有人认为参加学习是和日寇强制训练一样，不去不行；有人认为受训是找出路的门径；而大多数人则抱着混饭吃的态度，如在教育部工作的一位学员说：我为了生活，不给人家办事，有什么办法？因此开始学习时，一般的情绪不高，在行开学典礼的那一天，有的便说：越讲越头痛。有些人遇事抱着敷衍的态度，当小组开讨论会时，不敢大胆发言，对我党则采试探态度，而在生活方面，则尽量强调困难。
    领导上注意到这些现象后，认为要使大家的学习有收获，必须首先打破思想上的顾虑，于是便着重地向大家解释我党的各种政策，特别引用了许多实际的例子，再加上大家亲眼看见的人民解放军的严明纪律，和人民政府一直以积极恢复与发展生产为自己的中心工作等，而在对待他们时，则表现出光明磊落的态度，使其感觉到对他没有任何怀疑，此外，老干部艰苦朴实的作风，也给了他们很大影响，这种局面，很快便被扭转过来了。两个多月后，在学过社会发展史、思想方法和中国革命的基本问题后，大多数学员获得了显著进步，这就开始清除了过去的旧思想，初步建立起为人民服务的新人生观。下列的几方面便是一些进步的具体表现：
    首先应提出的是，多数学员分清了革命与反革命的界限，认识到国民党与共产党有着本质的不同，现在进行的人民解放战争，并不是国共在争权夺利，而是革命与反革命的决战。如有的说：我现在才知道，只有共产党才代表人民的利益。有的说：经过学习后，才知道我们过去作了四大家族的帮凶。对于苏联和美国也有了初步的认识，如有人在反省时说：现在我才知道美国帮助国民党军火武器，助长中国内战……其阴谋比日本要毒辣百倍。
    许多技术人员过去认为科学是超阶级的，科学工作者可以不问政治，而在今天则已放弃了这种落后的看法，如交通部、卫生部和农业科学研究所等部门训练班的大部分学员，明确地说，科学不能离开政治，没有第三条道路可走。
    对于社会发展的历史，有了一个初步的认识，开始承认劳动人民是历史的创造者，并纠正了过去看不起劳动人民的错误思想。
    对我党的政策渐渐有了了解，消除了过去的顾虑。已往是千方百计地隐瞒自己的历史，而今天已有不少人认识到过去反人民的罪恶，向领导上承认自己曾参加反动党团，如教育部训练班在学习一个阶段后，四十个学员中便有三十二个人自动说出了参加反动党派的经过。
    最后是工作作风已开始转变，过去作威作福、敷衍塞责、腐化堕落的作风被批判了，各部学员都纷纷表示，愿意服从组织调动。分配到水利工程队和棉产改进处的几十位学员，为了突击工作，自动提出增加夜班。大部分学员对学习都很认真，自订报纸，买参考书，在生活方面已开始表现艰苦作风，如有些部门的学员中午不回家吃饭，只吃一点自己带来的干粮。
    这一些学习的成绩，证明了中共中央教育改造知识分子的正确方针，特别是毛主席所著“论人民民主专政”，为大家解决了不少思想问题。但一切还只在开始，一个坚定的正确的革命人生观的建立，还需要经过长期的艰苦的锻炼！
