    Electric Tram Workers in the Upsurge of Learning
    Zhong Dejun
    More than one-third of the 1,500 employees of the Beijing Electric Tram Company have plunged into an upsurge of learning. In the South Factory (repair and manufacturing plant), after the team leaders conveyed the company's establishment of a workers' summer school on July 11th, 177 people immediately signed up to participate in the learning (accounting for about 60% of the total number of people). When the workers in the North Factory (tram road workers' dormitories, parking lot) heard the news, they immediately asked teachers to work with them to engage in learning. Tram road worker Comrade Shen Jiali helped various departments of the school to mobilize workers to study. Now, three learning units have been established in the North Factory, South Factory, and the company, with six college and middle school students responsible for each.

    Among the electric tram workers, the tram road workers (drivers, ticket sellers, inspectors, flagmen, etc.) are the most numerous and the busiest, but their enthusiasm for learning is particularly high. Among the nearly 50 tram road workers in the company section, when teachers asked about their learning time, they unanimously and enthusiastically requested two hours per day.

    In this way, nearly 50 tram road workers unfolded a full week of learning at the company from 3 to 5 pm every day.

    The workers love their study class. When participating in the study, many comrades, although restricted by their work, always try their best to participate in the learning. For example, Comrade Liu Xianchun, one of the members of the Dining Committee, sometimes has to calculate the accounts for the dining group and cannot sleep all night, and has to drive the next day, but still catches up with the study class and does not miss a single lesson. When he encounters unavoidable things that require him to be absent, he also solemnly asks the teacher or team leader for leave. These rules or disciplines are all spontaneous and conscious. For example, Comrade Chen Guizeng's child fell ill with convulsions, and he specially brought a hospital registration form to ask the teacher for leave. Comrade Jin Liquan changed from the early shift to the late shift, and specially wrote a letter to Comrade Li Bochun in his group, asking him to ask the team leader for leave. The letter said: "I have changed my shift to the late shift today, so I cannot participate in the learning. I hope you will listen carefully during the lecture and take notes on what the lecturer says so that I can know later. Also, explain to the team leader the reason why I cannot attend the class. I wish you to study hard and not fall behind." They encourage each other in class and maintain classroom order.

    Among them, young workers are the majority, but older workers are not to be outdone, and even take the lead. Liang Fushan, 53, argued with the young people for the sake of order in the class. He said that he came to participate in the study in order to "understand the Communist Party and understand the various principles of turning over and changing the sky." After studying, he understood that the Communist Party's methods are all for the people, and all the principles are reasonable. He said: "Now that we workers are in charge, everyone must work hard and one person must do the work of ten people. Don't let ten people do the work of one person, like when the Kuomintang was in power. Now we can give opinions and criticize mistakes to the trade union and the company, which shows that the Communist Party is working for the better. We must understand these things and work hard to learn." Guan Wenpeng, 55, is also never late or absent. He said he is not old and will learn as long as he lives. "Who is not tired? Who is not hot? However, if you don't understand the truth, how can you know your responsibility? We old people remember two sentences out of ten when we listen to lectures, but there are always two sentences. I have participated in these days of study, and I understand a lot more in my heart, and I feel much more comfortable. The more I learn, the more I want to learn. No one has ever told us this way in decades. I only know a little bit of words, but the reasoning is not clear. Young people have good brains and can remember four sentences out of ten when they listen to them, so they should study even more. If they don't understand the truth and don't know how to work hard, how can the tram company make money, and how can we live a good life?"

    Young worker Tao Qingyu wrote an article in their wall newspaper "New Youth" entitled "Learn from Old Worker Guan Wenpeng." He said that he is getting old and thinner than before, "but his spirit is particularly full." He said that he always helps with ticket sales and inspections, "and there is no distinction between inspection and sales. The more responsibilities you fulfill, the more you gain." "The summer study class has started, and Guan Wenpeng is also going to school. He is never late or absent. He concentrates on writing during the lecture, and also enthusiastically speaks and debates in group discussions. You can't see a trace of mental fatigue. Yes, we have turned over and are in charge! When people have happy events, they are refreshed and forget what it means to be tired. We must be an uncompromising old brother - the working class is the leader of the new China and must enrich themselves and accelerate their learning. We should all learn from Guan Wenpeng!"

    After a period of learning, the workers also see through that learning is not a great thing and is not difficult. Comrade Chang Yaozu said: "When our study class is about to end, we must ask Lao Zhong to give us a good job and lay a foundation. When he goes back to school, we will give lectures ourselves. Isn't Lao Zhong just reading books and telling us actual examples? We can also learn it, it's not difficult!"

    The upsurge of learning is rising, showing unparalleled strength. The production figures will tell us what kind of power this learning has and what it has brought.

    学习热潮中的电车工人们
    钟德钧
    北平市电车公司的一千五百多职工，已有三分之一的人，涌进了学习的热潮里。南厂（修造厂）工人，在七月十一日，经过小组长传达公司成立工人暑期学校后，立即有一百七十七人报名参加学习（占总人数约百分之六十）。北厂（车路工人宿舍、停车场）工人闻讯，也立即请教员去与他们一道搞学习了。车路工人沈家立同志，帮同学校各处动员工人学习。现在已成立了北厂、南厂、公司三个学习单位，由六位大中学同学分别负责。
    电车工人中，车路工人（司机、售票、稽查、杂旗等）最多，工作也很忙，但是他们学习的热忱，特别高，在公司部分近五十人的车路工人，教员征求他们的学习时间时，一致热烈要求每日二小时。
    就这样，近五十人的车路工人，就在公司展开了每日下午三至五时的全周学习。
    工人们热爱自己的学习班。在参加学习的时候，许多同志虽受自己工作的限制，但总是尽量争取，参加学习。如膳委之一的刘先春同志，有时因膳团算帐，通夜不得睡觉，第二天又要开车，但仍然赶上学习班，不缺一堂课。遇到了万不得已的事要缺课时，他也是那么严肃地来向教员或小组长告假，这些规则或纪律，全都是自发的，自觉的，比如陈贵增同志的小孩病了，患抽风，他特地拿了医院的挂号单来向教员请假。金立泉同志由早班改为晚班了，特地给同组的李伯纯同志写信，请他代向小组长请假，信上说：“弟于今日班次改为晚班，因此不能参加学习，望兄在讲课时间，用心听讲，讲师所讲之课望你随时笔记，以后我也能知道。还有，和组长说明我不能到课的原因。祝你加紧学习，不落人后”。他们在上课时彼此互勉，维持课堂秩序。
    这中间，青年工人是大多数，可是老年工人也不示弱，甚至走在前面。五十三岁的梁富善，为了班上秩序，和年青人吵了起来。他说他是为了“认识共产党，要明白翻了身，变了天的种种道理”，才来参加学习。学习后，他明白共产党的办法，都是为人民的，一切道理，都是合情合理的。他说：“我们工人当了家，就要人人努力，要一人顶十人干。不要十人顶一人干，象从前国民党在的时候磨洋工一样。我们现在能向工会，向公司，提意见，批评错误，这表现共产党是向好的一面作。我们要明白这些，就要来努力学习”。五十五岁的关文鹏，也是从不迟到，不缺课。他说他并不老，活一天，就要学一天。“那个又不累？，又不热？不过，不明白个道理，怎么知道自己责任？我们年老人听讲课，十句中记得两句，但总有两句，我参加了这些天学习，心里明白多了，畅快多了，越学越想学，几十年来，都没有人给我们这样讲，自己只认得点字，道理就不通。年青人脑力好，听十句就能记得四句，更应该来学习，不把道理弄清楚，不知道好好干活，电车公司那能赚钱，我们日子又那能过好？”
    青年工人陶庆余在他们的壁报“新青年”上著文“向老工友关文鹏看齐”。说他年纪渐老比以前消瘦多了，然而精神是特别饱满的”，说他总是帮助售票查票，“查与售并没分出界限，多尽一分责任多得一分收获”。“暑期学习班开课了，关文鹏也上学了，从来不缺课迟到，在讲课中，聚精会神在写，小组讨论上也热烈的发言辩论，看不出一点精神疲倦的样子。是的，翻身啦，当家啦，人得喜事精神爽忘了什么叫累了，我们要作一个不折不扣的老大哥——工人阶级是新中国领导者，必须充实自己，加紧学习，应一致向关文鹏看齐！”
    经过了一段学习之后，工人们也瞧穿学习不是了不起的事，不是难事，常耀祖同志说：“我们学习班快结束的时候，得叫老钟给我们好好搞搞，打下一个基础，他回学校去了，我们自己来讲，老钟还不是看一看书，配合我们告诉他的实际例子来讲，我们也学得会，不难！”
    学习的热潮，正在上升，显示着无比的力量，生产数字，将会告诉我们，这个学习，究竟有怎样的力量，究竟带来了什么。
