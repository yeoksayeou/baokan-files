    ▲ The Indian Statistical Office published a detailed analysis of the income and expenditure budgets of 5,000 civil servants in various Indian cities. It shows that so-called "general civil servants" live in shockingly miserable poverty. Seventy-five percent of civil servants are in debt and rely on usury to survive. The average monthly payment of principal and interest on debts takes up about 12% of their monthly salary.
    ▲ An anti-government riot broke out in the eastern Indian province of Assam in late July. Police arrested 400 people.
    ▲ More than 1,000 workers at a printing factory in Madras, on the southeast coast of India, continue to strike, demanding higher wages.
