　　Weeding and Seedling Protection Work in Chahar Province
　　Zhao Hong
　　In June and July of this year, all regions focused on weeding and seedling protection as the center of summer production. By the end of July, early-planted fields in Yishui, Pingxi, Jianping and other districts had been weeded twice, and some had begun to be weeded a third time. Cotton and peanuts had generally been weeded three to four times, and some individual farmers had weeded five times. Late seedlings had also been weeded once, and some had been weeded twice. In these areas, the plan to "guarantee three weedings, strive for four weedings" can be largely achieved. The climate in Yanbei, Chahan South, and Chahan North is later, and early seedlings have also been mostly weeded twice. As of July 18th, Lingqiu reported that 72% had been weeded twice. The development and achievements of the above work will lay an important foundation for this year's increased production.
　　However, many difficulties were encountered in weeding. These were: first, after July, there were continuous rains in various places, making it particularly difficult to weed due to large weeds; second, various disasters such as water scouring, siltation, and hailstorms occurred in various places; third, insect pests were still serious in some areas; fourth, the summer famine in parts of Chahan South and Pingxi made it difficult for the masses to live and they were unable to weed. Therefore, the weeding work was carried out under the strong leadership of the Party and the People's Government, with the extensive mobilization of labor, and under the slogan of "protecting seedlings as if protecting lives," combined with seedling protection work, and resolutely fighting against various disasters.
　　(1) Extensive mobilization of labor to participate in weeding is the first important link. The enthusiastic participation of women is one of the significant features. According to statistics from the first district of Guangling in Yanbei, there were a total of 4,420 women capable of labor, of which 3,535 participated in weeding, accounting for 80% of the total. They weeded a total of 32,943 mu of land, an average of more than nine mu per person; and on average, 70% of the laboring women in the county participated in weeding. In the Yishui district, about 80% of young women participated in weeding, and even the worst villages in Wanxian were above 20%. In Tangyi and other four villages in the first district of Fangshan County, Pingxi, 485 people (110 groups) participated in the weeding work groups, accounting for 50% of the female labor force. The Liu Zhuang Wang Youxian women's weeding work group in Lingqiu, with a total of five people, undertook the weeding task of 95 mu of land and completed 86 work points, all of which had been weeded twice. In addition, efforts were made to mobilize and supervise all landlords, rich peasants, loafers, and opium addicts who were capable of labor to participate in production. During the summer weeding, more than 80% of the landlords, rich peasants, loafers, and opium addicts in Guangling County participated in production. On the basis of the above, labor mutual aid was vigorously promoted. In Caojiazhai, Xiyanping and other villages in Fanshi, under the leadership of Party members, 32 groups were organized with 188 people, weeding 2,157 mu of land in ten days. There were also some developments in other regions.
　　(2) Engaging in a tenacious struggle against various disasters is the second link in summer weeding and seedling protection. First, overcoming the summer famine. During the weeding season, about 30,000 people in five counties of Pingxi had no food, and 23,000 people in Zhi Sihai County of Chahan South were also affected by the disaster (the number may be somewhat exaggerated). Under these circumstances, the above regions paid more attention to overcoming difficulties through the principle of self-reliance in production. The methods adopted in Laiishui and other four counties in Pingxi were to promote the sale of mountain products, organize coal transportation, dig medicinal herbs, and gather wild vegetables. By the beginning of July, the Zhangchang mountain product store in Fangshan had spent a total of 180 shi and 6,562 jin of millet on the three items of collecting large coal, burning coal, and collecting medicinal materials, which greatly solved the people's livelihood difficulties. Second, water, hail, and insect disasters were very serious. According to statistics in early July, a total of 260,000 mu of land in five districts were affected by water and hail disasters. Insect disasters were initially caused by locust nymphs (in 110 villages in four counties of Pingxi, and 150 villages in six counties of Yishui). By July 10th, they had been basically eliminated. Later, heartworms, armyworms, and bean leaf beetles (in Yanbei) became widespread. In Chahan South alone, more than ten kinds of pests were discovered, among which heartworms were the most harmful. In Yanqing and Longguan counties, 180,000 mu of millet seedlings were damaged. In addition, according to statistics from 78 villages in seven counties of Chahan South, 5,312 mu of rice seedlings were damaged. In 136 villages in 16 districts in four counties of Yanbei, more than 167,000 mu were affected, with damage to seedlings reaching 50% in severely affected areas, and 10% to 20% in mildly affected areas. Cotton aphids reappeared in parts of Yishui and Pingxi, and the masses were disappointed with the harvest and many destroyed the seedlings. The main methods to overcome the above disasters were to assign responsibility at each level, have cadres take action personally, have Party members and backbone take the lead, patiently persuade and mobilize the masses, and resolutely carry out the extermination; when it was confirmed that the harvest was hopeless due to the destruction of rice seedlings, specific difficulties were resolved and timely replanting and crop replacement were carried out. After discovering heartworms, the Hunyuan County Party Committee immediately organized cadres to go to the countryside to mobilize the masses, and within three or four days, they exterminated them in more than 7,000 mu of land; the district secretary and district head of Ying County personally studied the activity patterns of armyworms, mobilized the masses to catch insects, and were commended by the higher authorities. After Tingziling Village in Lingqiu was hit by hail, the morale of the masses was low. After the district cadres went deep into the branch, repeatedly educated them, and solved their difficulties, they completed replanting in three days. In 419 villages in 12 counties of Chahan South, more than 201,700 mu of land were affected by the disaster, and more than 129,000 mu were replanted. Through the above arduous and patient work, the disaster was largely overcome, and the autumn seedlings were preserved, laying the foundation for the autumn harvest.
　　(3) Weeding and seedling protection were also combined with checking for barren land and checking planting. At the end of June, there were still 530,000 mu of land in four counties of Chahan South that had not been planted. After the rain on June 25th, a concentrated effort was made, and by July 10th, all of it had been planted. In other areas, some land could not be planted on time due to insufficient inspection. In addition, the inspection of preferential treatment and farming on behalf of military families was carried out during weeding and seedling protection. Only after inspection could the weeding and seedling protection tasks be completed on time.
　　However, there were still biases and shortcomings in the summer weeding. For example, in some areas, the focus on weeding and seedling protection was not grasped, and many tasks were listed side by side; some cadres were not vigilant enough in overcoming disasters and carrying out seedling protection, or adopted a bureaucratic attitude, which led to the expansion of the disaster. These should all be taken as lessons.

　　察哈尔省的锄苗保苗工作
    赵洪
    今年六、七月份，各地均以锄苗、保苗为夏季生产的中心。至七月底，易水、平四、建屏等分区早种大田全已锄过二遍，一部开始锄三遍，棉花、花生一般锄过三至四遍，个别农家已锄五遍；晚苗也已锄完头遍，部分锄过二遍。这些地区，“保证锄三遍、争取锄四遍”的计划，大体是可以实现的。雁北、察南、察北气候较晚，早苗也已大部锄过二遍，至七月十八号，灵邱统计锄二遍者达百分之七十二。以上工作的开展和成绩，将为今年的增产打下重要基础。
    但是，锄苗中曾遇到许多困难。这便是：第一、七月以后，各地阴雨连绵，特别草大难锄；第二、各地均发生水冲、淤涝、雹打种种灾害；第三、部分地区虫害依然严重；第四、察南、平西部分地区的夏荒，群众生活困难，无力锄苗。因此，锄苗工作的进行，是在党和人民政府的坚强领导下，广泛地发动了劳动力，并在“保苗如保命”口号下，与保苗工作结合，和各种灾害做了坚决地斗争。
    （一）广泛地发动劳动力参加锄苗，这是第一个重要环节。其中妇女的踊跃参加，是显著特点之一。据雁北广灵一区统计，能劳动的妇女共四四二○人，其中三五三五人参加了锄苗，占总数百分之八十。她们共锄苗三二九四三亩，每人平均九亩多；而该县全县平均有百分之七十的劳动妇女参加了锄苗。易水分区青年妇女参加锄苗者约达百分之八十，完县最差的村也在百分之二十以上。平西房山县一区堂义等四村，锄苗中参加拨工组的四八五人（一一○组），占妇女劳动力的百分之五十。灵邱刘庄王有先妇女拨工组，共五人，全部负担九十五亩的锄苗任务，并进行拨工八十六个，均已锄过二遍。此外，是动员推督一切能劳动的地主富农、二流子、烟民参加生产，夏锄中，广灵县的地主富农、二流子、烟民有百分之八十以上参加了生产。在以上基础上，并大力领导了劳力互助，繁峙曹家寨、西沿平等村，在党员带动下，组织了三十二组，一八八人，十天锄苗二一五七亩。其他各地也有某些发展。
    （二）与各种灾害进行了顽强斗争，是夏锄保苗的第二个环节。第一、克服夏荒。锄苗中，平西五县约三万群众没吃的，察南只四海县亦有灾民二万三千人（数目可能有些夸大）。在此情况下，以上各地多注意了以生产自救的方针去克服困难，平西涞水等四县的方法是推销山货、组织运煤、刨药材、打野菜。只房山张场山货栈到七月初，以收大煤、烧煤、收药材三项，合计支出小米一百八十石，又六五六二斤，解决群众生活困难很大。第二、水、雹、虫灾均很严重。七月初统计，五个分区共受水、雹灾害者二十六万亩。虫灾，先为蝗蝻（平西四个县，一一○村，易水六个县一五○村发生。）于七月十号前已基本消灭；后普遍发生钻心虫、黏虫、花媳妇（雁北），只察南发现害虫十余种，其中尤以钻心虫为害最大，延庆、龙关两县咬坏谷苗十八万亩，另察南七县七十八村统计，被害禾苗五三一二亩，雁北四县十六个区又一三六村，受灾十六万七千余亩，重者毁苗达百分之五十，轻者亦在百分之十到二十。易水、平西部分地区复生棉蚜，群众对收成失望，毁苗者很多。克服以上灾害的办法，主要的在于逐级负责、干部亲自下手、以党员骨干带头、耐心说服和发动群众，坚决进行扑灭；禾苗被毁确已收成无望时，便具体解决困难，及时进行补种、改种，浑源县委于发现钻心虫后，即刻组织干部下乡，发动群众，三四天内即扑灭七千余亩；应县区书、区长亲自下手研究黏虫活动规律，发动群众捉虫，受到了上级的表扬。灵邱亭子岭村受雹后，群众情绪低落，经区干深入支部，反复教育，解决困难，三天即完成了补种。察南十二县四一九村，受灾二十万一千七百多亩，改种即达十二万九千多亩。经过以上艰苦耐心的工作，灾害大体被克服了，秋苗得以保全，打下了秋收的基础。
    （三）锄苗、保苗，又与查荒、查播种结合着进行了。在六月底，察南四县尚有五十三万亩土地没有播种。六月二十五日落雨后，抓紧突击，于七月十日，即全部种上。其他各地亦有因检查不够，致部分土地不能按时播种者。此外，锄苗、保苗中又进行优军代耕工作的检查，只有经过检查，锄苗、保苗任务才能按时完成。
    但是，夏锄中仍有偏向和缺点，如某些地区，不能抓住锄苗，保苗的中心，而把许多任务并列起来；某些干部，对克服灾害，进行保苗，警惕不够，或采取官僚主义态度，以致灾情扩大。这些均须引以为教训。
