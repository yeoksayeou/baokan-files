Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 27th: Generals Cheng Qian and Chen Mingren telegraphed Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on August 19th in reply. The text of the telegram is as follows:

To Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in Beiping: Your telegram of August 16th respectfully received. Profuse praise is an occasion for both shame and gratitude. We understand that you instructed us to unite our subordinates, cooperate closely with the People's Liberation Army, and prepare to reorganize into the People's Liberation Army, educate the troops with revolutionary spirit, change our style, strive for progress, and fight to eliminate the remaining bandits and liberate the people of the whole country. Qian and others have an unshirkable responsibility and will exert our utmost efforts to comply with your orders. Since the People's Liberation Army and the delegation entered Changsha, we have treated each other with sincerity, the military and civilians are jubilant, and order is peaceful and tranquil. As for the military and political institutions, they are being reorganized in sequence, and the troops are undergoing preliminary reorganization, all of which is progressing smoothly, which is somewhat gratifying. The future is arduous, and Qian and others are humble and shallow, and should be mindful of the admonition to act with caution. We hope for your instructions at any time.

Cheng Qian, Chen Mingren, August 19th
