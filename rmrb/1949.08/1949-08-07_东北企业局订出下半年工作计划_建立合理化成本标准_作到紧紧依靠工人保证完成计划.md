    [Northeast Dispatch] The Northeast Enterprise Bureau, based on the instructions from the Ministry of Industry regarding future work tasks and the decisions made at the Managers and Factory Directors Conference, has formulated a work plan for the second half of 1949. The plan requires workers in all factories to improve their skills, enhance quality, complete production quotas, establish relatively rational cost standards, implement quota management on a trial basis, and eliminate waste, in order to lay the foundation for production to become rationalized. The plan's implementation is divided into three stages, each with its own different work focus: The central task of the first stage (July 1 to September 15) is to review and formulate finished product specifications, establish a finished product inspection system, study various quotas, and calculate costs. The central task of the second stage (September 16 to November 15) is to overcome remaining shortcomings in quality, requiring that finished products reach preliminary quantitative and qualitative standards, implement quota management on a trial basis, eliminate waste, and establish preliminary, relatively rational cost standards. The third stage (November 16 to the end of December) includes the following tasks: (1) Coordinate with the trade union to summarize the merit campaign; (2) Conduct a general inspection of welfare work and safety equipment in each unit; (3) Summarize the year's work and prepare the annual final accounts. The plan requires close reliance on workers, handing the plan over to workers for discussion and research, so that the plan becomes a plan of the masses; at the same time, the technical level of employees should be improved to ensure the implementation of the plan.
    The plan calls for factory directors to focus their main energy on production management, establish scientific management systems, and oppose handicraft-style leadership; to raise political vigilance, strengthen anti-espionage, fire prevention, and anti-theft work, and oppose complacency.
    [Another Dispatch] The Northeast Enterprise Bureau, based on the half-year work plan, has decided to make the promotion of economic accounting the central task in August. Around this task, it is necessary to do a good job in reviewing and cleaning up property, vigorously carrying out the thrift movement, and establishing work systems. On July 25, the Bureau appointed 22 cadres responsible for property cleanup from various companies to form a property cleanup and review committee to review the cleanup of the property of various companies. The Bureau's internal property cleanup work also began on August 1. To ensure the completion of work tasks, it was decided to implement a system of individual responsibility, centralized management, and division of labor, centralized use, in August, establish scientific enterprise management methods, and overcome handicraft-style and guerrilla tactics.

    东北企业局订出下半年工作计划
    建立合理化成本标准
    作到紧紧依靠工人保证完成计划
    【东北讯】东北企业管理局根据工业部关于今后工作任务的指示及经理厂长会议的决定，订出一九四九年下半年工作计划。该计划要求各厂工人提高技术，改进质量，完成产量，建立比较合理化的成本标准，试行定额管理，消灭浪费现象，以奠定生产走向合理化的基础。该计划施行进度分三个阶段，每段各有其不同的工作中心：第一阶段（七月一日至九月十五日）的中心工作为审查与制订成品规格，建立成品检查制度，研究各种定额，计算成本。第二阶段（九月十六至十一月十五日）的中心工作为克服质量上尚存的缺点，要求达到初步定量定质的成品，试行定额管理，消灭浪费，建立初步比较合理的成本标准。第三阶段（十一月十六至十二月底）工作有下列几项：（一）协同工会总结立功运动；（二）对各单位福利工作及安全设备进行一次普遍检查；（三）总结本年工作，并编制全年决算。该计划要求紧紧依靠工人，把计划交给工人讨论研究，使计划变成群众的计划；同时并应提高职工技术水平以保证计划的实现。
    这个计划号召：各厂厂长要把主要精力放在生产管理上来，建立科学的管理制度，反对手工业领导方式；要提高政治警惕性，加强防奸、防火、防盗工作，反对麻痹思想。
    【又讯】东北企业管理局根据半年工作计划，决定八月份以推行经济核算为中心工作，围绕这一工作要做好审查、清理财产工作，厉行节约运动，建立工作制度。该局于七月二十五日由各公司指派负责清理财产干部二十二人，组成财产清理审查委员会，审查各公司财产之清理。局内财产清理工作，亦于八月一日开始。为保证工作任务的完成，八月份内决定试行个人负责集中管理制与分工负责集中使用制，建立科学的企业管理方法，克服手工业方式与游击作风。
