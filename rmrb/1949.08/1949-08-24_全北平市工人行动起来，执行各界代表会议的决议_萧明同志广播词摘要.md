　　Workers of the Entire Beiping Municipality, Actively Implement the Resolutions of the People's Representative Conference: Excerpts from Comrade Xiao Ming's Radio Address
　　Xiao Ming, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, gave a speech on the evening of the 23rd on Beiping People's Broadcasting Station, calling on "Beiping workers to mobilize and strive to implement the resolutions of the Beiping People's Representative Conference." Excerpts from the speech are as follows:
　　We, the 300,000 workers of Beiping, unanimously believe that this Beiping Municipal People's Representative Conference was a complete success. We support all the resolutions of the Representative Conference. We must bring into play the strength of the working class, sincerely and resolutely unite with the peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie of the entire Beiping area, thoroughly mobilize, and strive to implement the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference.
　　The main things we workers can do are as follows:
　　(1) Defend the people's property and suppress the reactionaries.
　　We have already established factory defense teams in every public enterprise to prevent and suppress the sabotage of saboteurs, which has achieved remarkable results. In the future, we must be more vigilant and strengthen our work. We also hope that the people of the entire city will thoroughly eliminate the enemy's hidden labor force. Only in this way can we smoothly carry out the construction of the new Beiping and support the national liberation war.
　　(2) Restore and develop production. Strive to increase the output of products and reduce costs.
　　In order to smoothly develop production, we have carried out a democratization movement in the management of public enterprises, established factory management committees, and carried out planned production. Now we are making special efforts to overcome difficulties, improve product quality, and reduce costs in order to expand sales and increase production as needed. In private enterprises, we are actively adjusting labor-capital relations to achieve the goal of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital. We negotiate with the capitalists to sign collective labor-capital contracts and abide by them together. At the same time, we are organizing trade unions from top to bottom, concentrating unified leadership, to promote work. Now, after the establishment of the city-wide trade union and the signing of a collective contract in the Chinese medicine industry, more than a dozen other industries, such as the flour industry, weaving and dyeing industry, construction industry, carpet industry, bathhouse industry, and papermaking industry, are starting to organize city trade unions, and some have already been established and are signing collective contracts. In addition, seventy or eighty worker consumer cooperatives and sideline production cooperatives have been organized, and nearly 100,000 workers have benefited from the cooperatives. In the future, we must work harder to overcome difficulties, correct mistakes, and better complete our tasks. We hope that the peasants of the entire city will closely integrate with us, work hard to produce, exchange industrial products and agricultural products, and complete the task of urban-rural mutual assistance. We hope that the petty bourgeoisie and national bourgeoisie of the entire city will work closely with us in production and actively develop production under the principle of benefiting both labor and capital.
　　(3) Strengthen the education of workers and their children.
　　In the past six months, every public and private enterprise and every district has regularly run various forms of training courses, study groups, and night schools to strengthen our political, cultural, and technical learning. So far, more than one-third of the workers have participated in the study. For example, in June, there were 70 night schools, 400 study groups, and 127 study classes (excluding districts) in the city; many old workers in their fifties and sixties are also actively and enthusiastically learning, playing a leading role in the factory. In June, excluding private enterprises and districts, the city had 15 drama troupes, 25 Yangge teams, and 33 choir teams. Each enterprise has worker-published wall newspapers and blackboard newspapers, as well as six typeset newspapers and eight mimeographed newspapers (excluding railways). More than 500 people are involved in newspaper work. Worker correspondents are present in almost every enterprise and every district, and their articles have become one of the main sources of newspaper articles. Their simple and healthy writing style is loved by the working people of the city.
　　This summer, more than 300 college and middle school students in the city participated in summer worker education work, helping 8,000 workers establish schools in more than 30 public factories, and serving as teachers in 45 worker night schools and 1,700 workers in 11 districts, which has achieved good results.
　　Although worker education has developed rapidly and worker culture has improved rapidly, there are still many difficulties and shortcomings. We should work hard to overcome them in the future. At present, we plan to have more than 2,950 workers and workers' children enter formal middle schools, of which 1,340 have already been admitted. We are currently planning to solve the education problem of more than 1,000 workers' out-of-school children.
　　(4) Launch a production and conservation movement.
　　At present, we are overcoming the difficulties caused by the sabotage of the reactionaries and the blockade of imperialism, and we are relying on our own efforts and developing production by saving production costs. Therefore, many dead locomotives have become active locomotives, and piles of waste have become useful raw materials. With the efforts and creativity of the workers, the consumption of power, tools, and raw materials has been greatly reduced. In the future, we must make saving production a long-term mass movement, not only saving power, raw materials, and tools, but also saving a screw and a piece of iron wire, so that they can exert the highest efficiency.
　　(5) Organize all workers to implement the resolutions.
　　We must quickly organize the worker brothers and sisters of the entire city in order to carry out various tasks in an organized manner. At present, more than 100,000 workers in the city are organized. In the future, we should redouble our efforts and accelerate the process, so that the trade union becomes the home of every member, so that every member cherishes the trade union and participates in trade union work, and improves their political, technical, and cultural level from work, and brings into play the wisdom and strength of the working class.
　　We, the workers of the entire city, must thoroughly mobilize to support the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference. Unite with the people from all walks of life, actively assist the People's Government, implement various resolutions, and strive to build a new Beiping, the people's capital!

　　全北平市工人行动起来，执行各界代表会议的决议
    萧明同志广播词摘要
    北平市职工总会筹委会副主任萧明于二十三日晚在北平人民广播电台讲演，号召“北平工人动员起来，为执行北平各界代表会议的决议而奋斗。”讲词摘录如下：
    我们北平三十万工人一致认为这一次北平市各界代表会议是完全成功的，我们拥护代表会议的一切决议，我们要发挥工人阶级的力量，真诚坚决的和全北平的农民、小资产阶级及民族资产阶级团结一致，彻底动员起来，为执行各界人民代表会议的决议而奋斗。
    我们工人能作的事情，主要的有下列几项：
    （一）保卫人民财产，镇压反动派。
    我们早已在每一个公营企业里成立了工厂保卫队，防范和镇压破坏分子的破坏，收到了显著的效果。今后更要提高警惕，加强工作。我们更希望全市人民共同彻底肃清敌人的潜伏劳力。因为只有这样才能顺利的进行新北平的建设，支援全国的解放战争。
    （二）恢复与发展生产。要努力提高生产品的产量并减低成本。
    为了顺利地发展生产，我们已在公营企业里进行管理民主化运动，建立工厂管理委员会，有计划的生产；现在我们特别努力克服困难，来提高产品质量，减低成本，以推广销路，按照需要增加产量。在私营企业中我们正积极调整劳资关系，达到发展生产，劳资两利的目的。我们与资方协议，订立劳资集体合同，共同遵守。我们同时自上而下的组织起工会，集中统一领导，来推动工作。现在，随国药业成立全市工会与签订集体合同之后，其他行业如面粉业、织染业、建筑业、地毯业、浴堂业、造纸业等十几个行业都在着手组织市工会，有的已经成立了，并进行签订集体合同。此外，工人消费合作社和副业生产合作社已组织七八十个，从合作社得到利益的工人已近十万人。今后我们更要努力克服困难，改正错误，更好的完成任务。我们希望全市农民和我们紧密结合，努力生产，交流工业产品和农业产品，完成城乡互助的任务，我们希望全市小资产阶级和民族资产阶级在生产上和我们紧紧的携手前进，在劳资两利的原则下，积极发展生产。
    （三）加强工人及其子弟的教育。
    半年来，我们每一个公营和私营企业，每一个区，经常兴办各种形式的训练班、学习小组、夜校等，来加强我们政治、文化、技术的学习。到现在，已有三分之一以上的工人参加了学习，例如六月份全市共有夜校七十个、四百个学习小组、一百二十七个学习班（各区除外）；许多五六十岁的老工友也在积极热心的学习，在工厂起了带头作用。六月份除私营企业及各区外，全市共有十五个剧团，有二十五个秧歌队，有三十三个歌咏队，各企业都有工人出版的壁报、黑板报，还有铅印报六种，油印报八份（不包括铁路），参加办报的工作人员在五百人以上。工人通讯员几乎每个企业、每个区都有，他们的稿件已成为报纸稿件的主要来源之一，他们朴素、健康的文风是全市劳动人民所喜欢的。
    今年暑期，本市三百余大中学生参加暑期工人教育工作，在三十几个公营工厂里帮助八千工人建立了学校，在十一个区的四十五个工人夜校、一千七百个工人中当教员，收到很好的效果。
    虽然工人教育很快的发展，工人文化很快的提高，但存在着的困难和缺点还很多，今后应该努力克服。目前打算使二千九百五十多工人和工人子女进入正式中学，其中有一千三百四十人已经入学了。最近正计划解决一千多工人失学子弟的教育问题。
    （四）展开生产节约运动。
    目前，我们正在克服由于反动派的破坏、帝国主义的封锁所引起的困难，用节约生产的方式来自力更生，发展生产。因此，许多死机车变为活机车，成堆的废料变为有用的原料，在工人的努力和创造之下大大地节省了动力、工具和原料的消耗，今后，要使节约生产成为一个长期性的群众运动，不但要节省动力、原料、工具，就是一个螺丝钉、一段铁线，也要节约，使它发挥最高的效能。
    （五）组织全体工人来执行决议。
    我们要迅速组织起全市的工人弟兄，才能有组织地进行各项工作。目前本市工人有组织的已有十余万人以上，今后更当加倍努力，加速进行，使工会成为每一个会员的家，使每一个会员爱护工会，参加工会工作，从工作中提高政治、技术、文化水平，发挥工人阶级的智慧和力量。
    我们全市工人要彻底动员起来，拥护各界代表会议的决议。与各界人民团结一致，积极协助人民市政府，贯彻实行各项决议，为建设人民首都的新北平而奋斗！
