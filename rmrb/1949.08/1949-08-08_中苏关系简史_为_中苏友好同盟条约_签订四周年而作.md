    A Brief History of Sino-Soviet Relations
    Written for the Fourth Anniversary of the Signing of the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance"
    Liao Gailong
    I.
    From the Opium War in 1840 until the Russian October Revolution in 1917, during those long 77 years, none of the powers (including Tsarist Russia) did not plunder and enslave the Chinese people. None treated us as equals, and none were friends of the Chinese people's liberation cause. But from the October Revolution onwards, the Chinese people had a powerful country as a loyal friend in our cause of liberation, and that friend was the Soviet Union.
    II.
    From the day the Soviet Union was born after the success of the October Revolution, it proposed to the people of all countries to "establish a solid and lasting peace," pointing out that the fundamental condition for this lasting peace was to deny foreign territorial aggression, forced annexation, and forced indemnities, etc. In December 1917, the Soviet government, in the same spirit, specially declared to the Eastern countries that it would automatically renounce all the unjust rights of the Tsarist era. Subsequently, it proposed negotiations to the Chinese government. Because these declarations and negotiations were blocked and rejected by imperialism and its running dog, the Beijing warlord government, in July 1919, the Soviet government issued a declaration directly to the Chinese people and the Beijing government and the Southwest government. This declaration not only reiterated the principle of treating us as equals but also pointed out with enthusiasm: "We are very willing to assist the people of the East, especially the Chinese people, in their movement to break away from the military and financial fetters of imperialism. We not only want to help the Soviet working class, but also want to help the Chinese people." This declaration immediately received a warm welcome from our people, from workers, peasants, and students to the liberal bourgeoisie, all members of parliament, and various folk newspapers.
    After the declaration was issued, the Beijing government still insisted on "acting in concert" with the Allied Powers of imperialism and ignored it. In this situation, the Soviet government issued a second declaration to China in September 1920, and in order to promote the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries, successively sent representatives Yurin, Paikesi, and Yuefei to China, but the Beijing government always refused to negotiate. In early 1923, the Soviet Union sent representative Karakhan to China, and under the pressure of the people, the Beijing government sent representatives to begin negotiations. After more than a year of procrastination and changes of heart, the Beijing government finally approved the "Outline Agreement for the Settlement of Outstanding Issues between China and Russia" at the end of May 1924, and the diplomatic relations between the two countries were officially restored.
    This "Sino-Russian Agreement" was the first equal treaty ever signed between China and a foreign country. In the agreement, the Soviet Union announced the automatic abolition of all unequal treaties signed between the old Russian government and the Chinese government, renounced privileges in China such as concessions, leased land, trade zones, barracks, etc., renounced the Boxer indemnity, extraterritoriality, and consular jurisdiction, and abolished the privileges of the Chinese Eastern Railway except for commercial affairs, etc., sweeping away all the aggressive acts of the Tsarist era against our country.
    Especially important is that the Soviet Union gave great help to the new revolutionary movement of the Chinese people, starting from the May Fourth Movement. The May Fourth Movement was carried out under the call of the October Revolution and Lenin. The most significant result of the May Fourth Movement was the development of the labor movement and Marxist-Leninist thought in China, that is, the combination of the two, which produced the vanguard of the Chinese proletariat—the Chinese Communist Party. Due to the emergence of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese proletariat ascended the stage of the Chinese revolution as an independent class and with the qualification of a leading force, and as a result, the face of Chinese history changed: the old democratic revolution era led by the bourgeoisie, weak and incompetent, and proved unable to win, gave way to the new democratic revolution era led by the proletariat, the masses of the people, anti-imperialist and anti-feudal, and united with the Soviet Union as part of the world proletarian revolution. Thanks to the direct assistance of the Soviet Union and the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the Great Revolution from 1924 to 1927 appeared in China. During this period, Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the Kuomintang, the revolutionary democrats of the Chinese national bourgeoisie, accepted the assistance of the Soviet Union and the suggestions of the CCP, adopted the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers from 1923 to 1924, reorganized the Kuomintang, reinterpreted the Three Principles of the People, established the Whampoa Military Academy, and established the National Revolutionary Army. Therefore, in 1925, the counter-revolutionary forces in Guangdong were swept away, and from 1926 to 1927, the Northern Expedition was launched, and great victories were achieved from the Pearl River Basin to the Yangtze River Basin and the Yellow River Basin. Without the help of the Soviet Union, such rapid and great victories of the revolution would be unimaginable.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen deeply knew that the joint advancement of the Chinese and Soviet peoples was one of the two major keys to the success of the Chinese revolution. In his will, he said: "We must awaken the masses and unite with the nations of the world who treat us as equals to fight together." The so-called must unite with the nations who treat us as equals means that we must unite with the Soviet Union. In his letter to the Soviet Union, he wrote with infinite enthusiasm: "Dear comrades, at this moment of farewell, I would like to express my fervent hope that dawn will soon break, at which time the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally, and the two countries will join hands in the great battle to fight for the freedom of the oppressed nations of the world to achieve victory. I wish you peace in the spirit of brotherhood."
    III.
    However, the Kuomintang reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, once they had used the blood of Chinese workers and peasants and the help of the Soviet Union to seize a large territory, immediately betrayed Sun Yat-sen's teachings, slaughtered communists and revolutionary workers and peasants domestically, surrendered to imperialism externally, and frantically opposed the Soviet Union.
    As early as March 20, 1926, Chiang Kai-shek launched a conspiracy coup under the pretext of the fabricated Zhongshan Warship Incident, dismissing two or thirty Soviet advisors who were helping the Chinese revolution. In April to July 1927, the Kuomintang carried out a massacre of revolutionaries, and at the same time dismissed and expelled all Soviet advisors. In December of the same year, the Kuomintang government besieged the Soviet consulate in Guangzhou, and brutally killed dozens of people, including the deputy consul. On December 14, the Kuomintang government announced a complete severance of relations with the Soviet Union, expelled Soviet consuls and overseas Chinese from various places, and closed all Soviet-run businesses in China. In July 1929, the Kuomintang government further directed the army of the warlords in the three northeastern provinces to infringe upon the Soviet Union's commercial interests in China—seizing the Chinese Eastern Railway and launching the most shameful adventurous war of armed aggression against the Soviet Union.
    Since the Kuomintang reactionary government launched an anti-people war internally and abandoned its international friend, the Soviet Union, externally, it gave the ferocious foreign invaders a chance to invade. In 1931, Japanese imperialism launched the "September 18th" Incident, and an unprecedented national crisis arrived.
    After the outbreak of the "September 18th" Incident, it was again the Soviet Union that extended a friendly helping hand to our country. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov issued an oral warning to Japan on September 24, and he also said: "The Soviet Union completely sympathizes with China morally, spiritually, and emotionally, and is willing to provide all necessary assistance." The Soviet government also proposed to the Chinese government to immediately restore diplomatic relations between the two countries. Under the demand of public opinion, the Nanjing government did not announce the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between the two countries until December 12, 1932. However, until the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1937, the Soviet government repeatedly proposed to conclude a treaty of non-aggression between the two countries, which was always rejected by the Kuomintang reactionary government.
    From 1927 to 1937, including the five years of "severance of relations" and the five years of "restoration of relations," was a dim period in the diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union. However, the Kuomintang's frantic anti-Soviet policy only implemented the will of their master, imperialism, and could never represent the will of the Chinese people. During these ten years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people continued to carry out revolutionary struggles against the counter-revolutionary Kuomintang and the Japanese invaders. The deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples continued to grow. Although imperialism and the Kuomintang set up heavy iron walls, they still could not stop the development of cultural exchanges between the two countries. During this period, the Soviet Union and the proletarians of all countries consistently gave great support to the revolutionary struggle of our people. The ten-year revolutionary war and the anti-Japanese national salvation movement carried out by the Chinese people during this period were absolutely not isolated.
    IV.
    After China achieved domestic peace in 1937 and began the War of Resistance Against Japan, the country that provided the earliest and most assistance to us was the Soviet Union. In August 1937, the Soviet Union and China signed a treaty of non-aggression. The Soviet Union provided our country with US$300 million in combat materials to assist in the War of Resistance. Soviet aviators and military experts volunteered to come to China in batches to serve, shedding their heads and blood with the Chinese people.
    After the Soviet Union was subjected to the treacherous attack by German fascism in June 1941, it had to first concentrate all its efforts to crush the German aggressors.
    Since then, the Kuomintang has implemented a reactionary policy of actively opposing the people and opposing the Soviet Union, putting Sino-Soviet relations in an abnormal and cold state, and putting the Chinese War of Resistance in the most difficult situation.
    After German fascism was defeated in May 1945, the Japanese invaders entrenched on the Chinese mainland were still trying to resist stubbornly. At this time, the eyes of the world were focused on the powerful and invincible Soviet Red Army. It is universally recognized that only the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to defeat the main force of the Japanese army can defeat the Japanese invaders. Therefore, there were the negotiations between China and the Soviet Union before and after the Potsdam Conference, and the signing of the "Sino-Soviet Thirty-Year Treaty of Friendship and Alliance" on August 14 of the same year.
    In the Sino-Soviet negotiations, the Soviet Union assumed the obligation to fight against Japan. From August 9th, the Soviet Red Army entered the Northeast and annihilated one million Kwantung Army, the main force of the Japanese Army, forcing Japanese imperialism to declare unconditional surrender, thus enabling the people of the Northeast and the people of all China to be quickly liberated from the oppression of the Japanese invaders. This is a direct result of the friendly understanding between China and the Soviet Union.
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance stipulated that the two countries would help and cooperate with each other during the war against Japan and after defeating Japan in order to maintain peace and stability in the Far East and prevent Japan from rising again for aggression. For this purpose, the two countries also agreed to jointly operate the Changchun Railway and jointly use the Lushun military port and the Dalian commercial port in commercial affairs. This treaty laid the cornerstone of peace in the Far East. Precisely because of this, this treaty is entirely beneficial to the cause of liberation of the Chinese people, and entirely beneficial to the Chinese people. It is only unfavorable to those imperialists and their running dogs who attempt to invade China, especially those who attempt to invade the Northeast, and attempt to trample the people of the Northeast and the people of all China under their feet again. Therefore, the Chinese people warmly support this treaty; and the imperialists and their running dogs, after Japan was defeated in the war, turned to frantically slander this treaty and frantically slander the Soviet Union.
    V.
    The Soviet Union has consistently adopted a policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. The Soviet Union's policy stands in sharp contrast to the policy of American imperialism of assisting Chiang Kai-shek in carrying out civil war and invading China. Therefore, it exposed the true face of American imperialism's attempt to enslave the Chinese people and shattered the adventurous attempts of imperialist warmongers to provoke new wars on the Chinese mainland. This policy is only unfavorable to imperialism and its running dogs, and is extremely beneficial to the cause of liberation of the Chinese people and to the Chinese people.
    The Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people to rely on their own strength in this domestic revolutionary war, obtained American weapons and materials from the annihilated Kuomintang army, and finally defeated the Kuomintang, the running dog of American imperialism. The Chinese people are proud of this.
    However, it would be absolutely wrong to think that the Chinese people could have achieved such a great victory as they have now without the assistance of the Soviet Union and the people of all countries. The great assistance of the Soviet Union and the people of all countries to the cause of liberation of the Chinese people lies in the fact that the Soviet Red Army, as the main force, defeated fascist Germany, Italy, and Japan, and helped the Eastern European countries to liberate themselves from imperialist rule, thereby greatly weakening the imperialist front and making it easier for China to defeat its own enemy, the Kuomintang reactionaries and the imperialist forces behind them. It lies in the fact that, after World War II, the Soviet Union led the people's democratic countries and the people of all countries to form a powerful anti-imperialist peaceful and democratic camp, resisting the aggressive policies of the imperialist reactionary camp. Because the main force of imperialism was concentrated in the West, the imperialist reactionary camp was also unable to concentrate its forces to suppress the Chinese revolution, and it was not easy to launch an adventurous armed intervention against the Chinese people. Only under this situation can we achieve the victory of the revolution in the East, where the imperialist front is relatively weak. The decisive help that the Soviet Union gave to the victory of the Chinese revolution also lies in the Soviet Union's help to the Chinese people's anti-imperialist movement in terms of ideology, theory, politics, and even various forms of practical action, especially theoretical help. The Soviet Union gave us the armament of Marxism-Leninism. Without this theoretical armament, the people's revolutionary movement would absolutely not be able to achieve today's victory.

    After winning the revolution, the Chinese people must also defend the victory of the revolution and carry out great construction work to steadily transform China from an agricultural country into an industrial country and from a new democratic country into a socialist country. In both of these aspects, the Chinese people must obtain the assistance of the proletarians of all countries, primarily the assistance of the Soviet Union. Let us consolidate and develop the fraternal alliance between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

    中苏关系简史
    为“中苏友好同盟条约”签订四周年而作
    廖盖隆
    一
    从一八四○年鸦片战争起，直到一九一七年俄国十月革命以前，在这七十七年的长时期间中，列强（包括帝俄）没有一个不是掠夺和奴役中国人民的，没有一个是以平等待我的，没有一个是中国人民解放事业的友人。但是从十月革命起，中国人民就有了一个强大的国家，作为我们在求解放事业中的忠实朋友了，这个朋友就是苏联。
    二
    苏联自十月革命成功呱呱坠地的一天起，就向世界各国人民提议“树立巩固永久的和平”，指出这个永久和平的根本条件就是否认外国的领土侵略、强制合并及强制赔款等等。一九一七年十二月，苏联政府又以同一精神特别向东方各国，宣言自动放弃帝俄时代的一切不正当权利，随后即向中国政府提议进行谈判。由于这些宣言和交涉都为帝国主义及其走狗北京军阀政府所封锁和拒绝，一九一九年七月苏联政府乃发表直接给中国人民和北京政府及西南政府的宣言。这个宣言不仅重申平等待我的原则，而且热诚地指出：“我们对于东方民族，尤其对中国人民想脱离帝国主义武力和财力羁绊的运动，是很想予以援助的。我们不仅想救助苏联劳动阶级，而且想救助中国人民。”这个宣言，立刻得到了我国人民从工人、农民、学生以至自由资产阶级、全体国会议员和民间各报的热烈欢迎。
    这个宣言发表后，北京政府仍坚持与帝国主义的协约国“一致行动”而置之不理。在这种情况下，苏联政府又于一九二○年九月发表第二次对华宣言，并为促使两国外交恢复，先后派遣代表优林、裴克思、越飞来华，但北京政府始终拒绝谈判。到了一九二三年初，苏联又派代表加拉罕来华，北京政府在人民的压力下，才派出代表开始谈判。中经一年多的拖延、变卦，到一九二四年五月底，北京政府才批准“解决中俄两国悬案大纲协定”，两国邦交才正式恢复。
    这个“中俄协定”，是中国与外国破天荒第一次签订的平等条约。在协定中，苏联宣布自动废除旧俄政府与中国政府签订的一切不平等条约，放弃在中国的租界、租地、贸易圈、兵营等特权，放弃庚子赔款，治外法权及领事裁判权，取消中东路除商业事务外的特权等等，把帝俄时代对我国的侵略性行为一扫而尽。
    尤其重要的是苏联给了中国人民从五四运动为起点的新的革命运动以极大的帮助。五四运动就是在十月革命和列宁的感召下进行的。五四运动的最重大的结果，就是工人运动和马克思列宁主义思潮在中国的发展，就是两者互相结合起来，产生了中国无产阶级的先锋队—中国共产党。由于中国共产党的产生，中国无产阶级以独立的阶级和以领导力量的资格登上中国革命舞台的结果，中国的历史就改变了面目：以资产阶级为领导的、软弱无能的、已经证明无法取得胜利的旧民主主义革命时代让位给了以无产阶级为领导的、人民大众的、反帝反封建的、并与苏联联合而作为世界无产阶级革命一部分的新民主主义革命时代。由于苏联直接的帮助和国共合作，中国出现了一九二四年到一九二七年的大革命。在这个时期中，中国民族资产阶级革命民主派的孙中山先生和国民党，接受了苏联的帮助和中共的建议，在一九二三年到一九二四年，采取了联俄、联共、扶助农工的三大政策，改组了国民党，重新解释了三民主义，建立了黄埔军校，建立了国民革命军，因而在一九二五年，扫荡了广东的反革命势力，在一九二六年到一九二七年，举行了北伐，取得了从珠江流域到长江流域和黄河流域的巨大胜利。没有苏联的帮助，革命这样迅速而巨大的胜利是不能设想的。
    孙中山先生深知中苏两国人民携手并进，是取得中国革命成功的两大关键之一。他在遗嘱中说：“必须唤起民众及联合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奋斗。”所谓必须联合以平等待我之民族，就是说必须联合苏联。他在致苏联的遗书中，无限热诚地写道：“亲爱的同志，当此与你们诀别之际，我愿表示我热烈的希望，希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利。谨以兄弟之谊祝你们平安。”
    三
    但以蒋介石、汪精卫为首的国民党反动派，一旦利用了中国工农的鲜血和苏联的帮助抓得了大地盘以后，就立刻背叛了孙中山的遗教，对内屠杀共产党和革命工农，对外投降帝国主义，疯狂地反对苏联。
    早在一九二六年三月二十日蒋介石就举行了以捏造的中山舰事件为借口的阴谋事变，将二三十个帮助中国革命的苏联顾问解职。到了一九二七年四月到七月国民党便对革命者举行了大屠杀，同时将所有的苏联顾问解职、驱逐。同年十二月国民党政府在广州围攻苏联领事馆，惨杀了副领事以下数十人。十二月十四日国民党政府宣布对苏全面绝交，驱逐各地苏联的领事和侨民，封闭一切苏联在华经营的事业。一九二九年七月，国民党政府更进一步指挥东三省军阀的军队，侵犯苏联在华的商业利益——强占中东路，并发动了最可耻的武装进攻苏联的冒险战争。
    国民党反动政府既然对内举行反人民的战争，对外又背弃了国际的好友苏联，就使凶恶的外国侵略者有机会打进来了。一九三一年日本帝国主义发动了“九一八”事变，空前未有的民族危机就到来了。
    “九一八”事变爆发后，又是苏联对我国伸出了友谊的援手。苏联外长李维诺夫于九月二十四日向日本提出口头警告，他并且说：“苏联在道义上、精神上、感情上完全同情中国，并愿尽一切必要的帮助。”苏联政府并向中国政府提议立即恢复两国邦交。在舆论的要求下，延至一九三二年十二月十二日，南京政府才宣布恢复两国正常的外交关系。但直到一九三七年抗战爆发前，苏联政府数度提议订立两国互不侵犯条约，始终为国民党反动政府所拒绝。
    一九二七年到一九三七年，包括“绝交”的五年和“复交”的五年，乃是中苏两国邦交黯淡的时期。但是国民党疯狂的反苏政策只是执行了他们的主人帝国主义的意旨，而绝不能代表中国人民的意旨。中国人民在这十年中，在中国共产党领导下，继续进行革命斗争，反对反革命的国民党和日本侵略者。中国人民和苏联人民的深厚友谊仍然是日益增进的。帝国主义和国民党虽设立了重重的铜墙铁壁，仍然不能阻止两国文化交流的发展。苏联和各国无产者在这时期中一贯地给了我国人民的革命斗争以伟大的声援，中国人民在这个时期所进行的十年革命战争和抗日救亡运动绝对不是孤立的。
    四
    一九三七年中国实现了国内和平，开始了对日抗战之后，对我援助最早最多的国家，又是苏联。一九三七年八月，苏联与中国订立了互不侵犯条约。苏联曾以三万万美元的作战物资援助我国抗战。苏联的航空员和军事专家曾成批地志愿来华服务，同中国人民一起抛头颅，洒热血。
    一九四一年六月苏联遭到德国法西斯背信弃义的进攻之后，它不能不首先集中全力去粉碎德国侵略者。
    自那时以后，国民党又执行了积极的反人民反苏的反动政策，使中苏邦交处在不正常的冷淡状况中，并使中国抗战处在最困难的境地中。
    一九四五年五月德国法西斯被击败以后，盘踞在中国大陆上的日本侵略者还在企图顽抗。这时举世的目光都集中在强大无敌的苏联红军身上。举世公认只有苏联出兵击溃日本的陆军主力才能打败日本侵略者。因此才有波茨顿会议前后中苏两国的谈判，才有同年八月十四日“中苏三十年友好同盟条约”的签订。
    在中苏谈判中，苏联担承了对日作战的义务。八月九日起苏联红军进兵东北，歼灭了日本陆军的主力一百万关东军，迫使日本帝国主义宣布无条件投降，因此使东北人民和全中国人民迅速地从日寇压迫下得到解放。这是中苏两国友好谅解的直接结果。
    中苏友好同盟条约规定了两国在对日作战期间和在打败日本以后互助合作，以便维护远东的和平和安定，防止日本再起侵略。为此目的，两国又协议在商业事务上共同经营长春铁路，共同使用旅顺军港和大连商港。这个条约奠定了远东和平的基石。正因为如此，这个条约是完全有利于中国人民的解放事业的，完全有利于中国人民的，仅仅对于企图侵略中国而特别是企图侵略东北，企图重新把东北人民和全中国人民踩在脚底下的那些帝国主义者及其走狗，才是不利的。因此，中国人民热烈地拥护这个条约；而帝国主义者及其走狗在日本被战败以后，则转而拼命诽谤这个条约，拼命诽谤苏联。
    五
    苏联对中国一贯地采取了不干涉中国内政的政策。苏联的这种政策和美国帝国主义援助蒋介石进行内战、侵略中国的政策，恰恰站在相反的地位。因此就揭露了美国帝国主义企图奴役中国人民的真面目，打破了帝国主义战争贩子在中国大陆上挑拨新战争的冒险企图。这种政策又仅仅是对于帝国主义及其走狗才是不利的，而对于中国人民的解放事业，对于中国人民则是极为有利的。
    中国共产党领导中国人民，在这一次国内革命战争中，依靠自己的力量，从被歼灭的国民党军队手中取得了美国的武器和物资，终于战胜了美国帝国主义的走狗国民党。中国人民对于这一点，是引以为荣的。
    但是如果认为中国人民没有苏联和各国人民的援助，就能取得现在这样伟大的胜利，这种想法就是绝对错误的。苏联和各国人民对于中国人民解放事业的巨大援助，就在于苏联红军担任了主力军打败了法西斯德、意、日，并帮助了东欧各国从帝国主义统治下解放出来，因而就大大削弱了帝国主义战线，使得中国易于战胜自己的敌人国民党反动派及其背后的帝国主义势力，就在于，在第二次世界大战以后，苏联领导了各人民民主国家和各国人民，组成了强大的反帝国主义的和平民主阵营，抗击了帝国主义反动阵营的侵略政策，由于帝国主义的主要力量集中在西方，帝国主义反动阵营也便无法集中力量来镇压中国革命，和不易于发动对中国人民的冒险的武装干涉，只是在这种情形下，我们才能在帝国主义战线比较薄弱的东方取得了革命的胜利。苏联给予中国革命胜利的决定性的帮助还在于，苏联对于中国人民反帝运动在思想上、理论上、政治上以至各种形式的实际行动上的帮助，尤其是理论上的帮助，苏联给了我们马克思列宁主义的武装。没有这种理论武装，人民革命运动就绝对不可能获得今日的胜利。
        ×    ×    ×
    中国人民在取得革命的胜利之后，还必须保卫革命的胜利，并进行伟大的建设工作，使中国稳步地由农业国变为工业国，由新民主主义国家变为社会主义国家。在这两方面，中国人民都必须取得各国无产阶级的援助，首先主要地是取得苏联的援助。让我们巩固和发展中苏两国人民的兄弟同盟吧。
