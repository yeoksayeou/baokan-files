    Building Party Strongholds in Factories and Mines
    Northeast Bureau Issues Party Building Notice
    A Large-Scale and Cautious Development Approach Should Be Adopted
    [Shenyang Xinhua Radio Broadcast] The Organization Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee recently issued a notice on building the Party in factories and mines. The notice pointed out: At present, the conditions for actively developing worker Party members and establishing Party strongholds in factories and mines in the Northeast are ripe. Therefore, Party building work should be carried out in a planned manner. It further pointed out: At present, in developing the Party in factories and mines, a policy of active, open, large-scale, and cautious development should be adopted, with the focus on state-owned enterprises. The targets for development should focus on public-owned, longer-term, skilled, and technically proficient workers who are active in production and highly politically conscious, as well as heroes and model workers in various struggles and movements, and active members in trade union work and the Communist Youth League. All Party members in factories and mines should be mobilized to actively and responsibly carry out this work.
    [Shenyang Xinhua Radio Broadcast] The Northeast Daily published an editorial on the 6th, titled "Actively Develop Worker Party Members and Establish Party Strongholds in Factories and Mines." The editorial pointed out: The entire Party in the Northeast must immediately change the serious closed-doorist tendencies that exist in the development of worker Party members. First, we must understand that our Party is the political party of the working class. Second, we must understand that it is fundamentally impossible to successfully complete the great and arduous new task of economic construction without the selfless efforts of the entire working class and their active participation in leading economic construction. Regarding how to develop worker Party members and establish Party branches in factories and mines, the editorial pointed out: All Party members in factories and mines should be mobilized to take on the task of developing Party members in production movements. At the same time, a certain number of cadres should be transferred to work in factories and mines. In addition to assigning necessary administrative cadres, others should initially work in trade unions in order to organize, educate, and raise the consciousness of workers. In the process of developing production, conscious and outstanding workers should be absorbed into the Party in a step-by-step and planned manner, and on this basis, Party branches should be established in factories and mines. The editorial concluded by pointing out: While opposing closed-doorist tendencies in the development of worker Party members, it is also necessary to strictly prevent any phenomenon of simply pulling people in to make up the numbers.

    在工厂矿山中
    建立党的堡垒
    东北局发布建党通知
    应采取大量谨慎发展方针
    【沈阳新华电台广播】中共中央东北局组织部日前发布关于在工厂矿山中建党的通知。通知中指出：目前在东北积极发展工人党员，在工厂矿山建立党的堡垒的条件已经成熟，因此应该有计划的进行建党工作。接着又指出：当前在工厂矿山中发展党，应该采取积极的公开的大量而谨慎发展的方针，重点放在国营企业，发展对象，着重公营的较长的熟练的有技术的生产积极和政治觉悟高的工人，在各种斗争和各种运动中的英雄模范，和工会工作中青年团中的积极分子。应该动员工厂矿山的全体党员，积极负责的进行这一工作。
    【沈阳新华电台广播】东北日报六日以积极发展工人党员建立工矿中党的堡垒为题，发表社论。社论中指出：东北全党必须立即改变在发展工人党员上存在着的严重的关门主义偏向，首先我们必须了解我们的党是工人阶级的政党，其次必须了解要胜利完成伟大而艰巨的经济建设的新任务，没有全体工人阶级的奋不顾身的努力，和积极参加经济建设的领导，是根本不可能的。对于如何发展工人党员建立工矿中党的支部，社论中指出：要动员工厂矿山中全体党员在生产运动中都担负发展党员的工作，同时抽调一定数量的干部到工矿中去，除了分配必要的行政干部以外，其他开始都作工会工作，以便从组织教育提高工人觉悟，在发展生产过程中有步骤有计划的吸收觉悟的优秀的工人入党，并在这个基础上建立党在工矿中的支部。社论最后指出：反对发展工人党员中的关门主义偏向，同时也要严格防止任何拉夫凑数的现象。
