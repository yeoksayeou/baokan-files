Introduction to the Beiping Waterworks Employees' Consumer Cooperative
　　Zheng Zhong

　　The cooperative of the Beiping Waterworks is one of the more well-established consumer cooperatives in Beiping. Its advantages are:

　　I. Responsible Cadres.

　　They have a total of six cadres who are detached from production and four cadres who are not detached from production. Among the six detached cadres, three are of worker origin. All the cadres are wholeheartedly dedicated to their work, working from early morning until 8 or 9 pm every day. They often work overtime before and after payday, but no one complains, demonstrating the unique perseverance of the working class. In terms of business operations, they manage whatever the members need. In the summer, when DDT was needed, they bought gasoline and powder themselves to prepare it in order to save money for the members, which was 62% cheaper than the market price. When members reported that the coal was not burning well, they immediately contacted the coal plant to investigate, and returned it if necessary, without fear of trouble. Most importantly, they set an example by "working first, enjoying later." They only bought anything after the members had bought it. Also, the members' group leaders consciously took time to help sell goods, which played a significant role in the development of cooperative affairs. Members reflected: "The people in the cooperative have a really good attitude, they can handle things, and they are selfless."

　　II. Close contact with the administration, the Trade Union, and the Municipal General Cooperative.

　　The company administration provides great assistance to the cooperative. The cooperative's address and furniture were all borrowed from the company, and the company lent vehicles every time grain was transported. It also assisted the cooperative's capital turnover, making deposits and loans at any time. When paying wages, it also deducted payment for goods on behalf of the cooperative.

　　The relationship between the Trade Union and the cooperative is even closer. Three members of the Labor Insurance Department are also members of the cooperative's council. The Trade Union finds ways to help solve any difficulties the cooperative has; the cooperative also regularly reports to the Trade Union in writing and orally.

　　The cooperative attaches great importance to the various instructions of the General Cooperative, either implementing them immediately or submitting them to the cooperative committee for discussion. For example, when the General Cooperative instructed to organize household production, it was discussed in detail by the cooperative committee, and the first step was to implement the sale of household by-products on consignment. If there were any unclear issues, they humbly asked the General Cooperative for instructions. For example, they recently asked two questions: (1) Should stamp duty be affixed to the cooperative's domestic trade? (2) Can material rewards be given to members who buy the most goods?

　　III. Flexible capital turnover, striving to benefit members in business operations.

　　Their business policy is: (1) to facilitate members; (2) to maintain capital in kind; (3) not to rely on the factory; (4) to adjust prices at any time; (5) to find sales channels for members' household by-products; (6) to avoid cash transactions as much as possible.

　　Due to the support of the Grain Company and the General Cooperative, grain can be purchased on credit for ten days, and daily necessities for seven days, which is actually equivalent to consignment sales, increasing the actual efficiency of capital. Therefore, goods can be sold to members on credit, so that members can obtain grain, coal, and daily necessities at any time, which increases the members' purchase rate. (In June, members' purchases accounted for 21.5% of total wages, which increased to 30% in July).

　　They have no departmentalism or speculative behavior. They issue grain purchase registration forms to members every month and buy grain according to the statistics. Other goods are also quickly replenished when they are almost sold out. The goods arrive and are quickly sold out, ensuring continuous supply of goods and invigorating capital turnover. They repurchase goods in kind from small profits and quick sales, and in addition to maintaining capital, they have a surplus, gradually expanding the economic foundation of the cooperative. From May 23 to the end of June, the cooperative had a surplus of 261,543.75 yuan, equivalent to 4,870 jin of millet.

　　In addition, in order to facilitate members, the cooperative found a high-quality electric mill to process food; they bought 200 tons of fine coal from the General Cooperative Coal Plant and exchanged it for coal balls, which were delivered to members' homes for purchases of 500 jin or more.

　　The credit sales method is the most successful experience of the cooperative. Credit sales are possible from the second day after payday. The person buying on credit signs and stamps the receipt. On the 14th or 28th of each month, cooperative cadres find out the prices of various goods, calculate the total amount of each person's credit purchases, and list the total amount owed by each department and submit it to the accounting department for deduction. In this way, members can buy goods at any time without money, the cooperative saves time on counting money and collecting debts, and the accounting department can pay out less cash when paying salaries, reducing withdrawals from the bank. If all organs and factories in the city implement this, the amount of currency in circulation on the market when paying salaries can be reduced, which can play a considerable role in stabilizing market prices.

　　IV. Preliminary realization of democratic management

　　The Waterworks had a cooperative before liberation, but the personnel were sent by the factory, and the business operations did not meet the needs of the members. Today's cooperative is very different. The cadres are all democratically elected, and there is a relatively complete organizational system. Below the members' congress is a members' representative meeting composed of 39 representatives (one representative is elected for every 10 to 15 members). The representative meeting is held once a month to reflect the members' demands, determine business policies and other important matters. Cooperative cadres report on business operations at the meeting, and submit the accounts to the representative meeting for review and publication. The cooperative affairs committee is responsible for implementing cooperative affairs. The committee has seven members, four of whom are produced by the representative meeting and three of whom are members of the Trade Union Labor Insurance Committee. The cooperative committee stipulates that meetings should be held every two weeks, and temporary meetings are often held. All major cooperative affairs are passed by the cooperative committee.

　　The group leader (i.e., the member representative) truly plays a bridging role between the members and the cooperative. On the one hand, they publicize the nature of the cooperative to the members and explain the problems in the work; at the same time, they represent the interests of the members, collect and reflect opinions to the cooperative. If it can be done, it is done; if it cannot be done, it is explained to the members. Group leaders often go to the cooperative to copy down the names and prices of goods and convey them to the members, and sometimes bring samples of the goods. Many doubts among the members disappeared after the group leader's patient explanation.

　　Under this kind of democratic and centralized management, the members and cadres are as close as family members. Because in the past they were all old partners for many years, and today they are elected as their representatives to seek their own interests, so everyone regards the cooperative as their own. Whenever grain is transported, as long as the workers know about it, they all run to help unload the truck. Once, a group of field workers had just returned to the company and were about to sit down and rest when they heard that the cooperative's grain had arrived. They immediately went to help and unloaded 20,000 jin of grain in a quarter of an hour. One worker said: "The current cooperative truly protects the interests of the members, and it is better to be able to buy cheap things than to share dividends. Isn't the money the cooperative earns used to benefit everyone?" This sentence represents the opinion of the majority, because they have truly experienced the spirit and essence of the new cooperative from their actual actions. Currently, out of the company's 470 employees, 468 have joined the cooperative. Only two temporary workers have not joined, and there are a total of 1,199 family members. More than 90% of the monthly grain needs are supplied by the cooperative. In general, the basic advantage of this cooperative is that the cadres work enthusiastically and humbly and connect with the masses. However, there are still the following shortcomings that need to be overcome:

　　I. Accounts cannot be settled in time: The reason is that they are selling goods all day long and there is no fixed and sufficient time for settlement. However, if the accounts cannot be settled on time, it is impossible to understand the specific situation of funds and debts in time, which directly affects business operations. This issue should be discussed at the members' representative meeting to clearly stipulate the daily sales and settlement time.

　　II. Individual cadres sometimes "accommodate" in business, which affects the adherence to the entire work system.

　　III. Propaganda and education work is not enough. Therefore, there are still a few members who still look at the cooperative with old eyes and treat the cooperative cadres with the attitude of treating merchants. This needs to be overcome by strengthening education to the members.

　　IV. Cadre learning is very poor: Most of the cadres are from clerical jobs and lack the habit of learning. The cooperative work is also very busy, and they cannot make good use of their time to learn. Therefore, they will not be able to improve their political theory and professional knowledge, which will affect the further development of future work and must be vigorously overcome.

　　北平自来水公司职工消费合作社介绍
    郑重
    北平自来水公司的合作社，是目前北平市消费合作社中比较健全的一个，它的优点是：
    一、干部负责。
    他们共有六个脱离生产的干部和四个不脱离生产的干部。在脱离生产的六个人中，有三个是工人出身。全体干部都一心一意搞好工作，每天从清早一直工作到下午八九点钟，发工资前后还常加夜工，可是谁也没有怨言，表现了工人阶级特有的坚忍性。在业务经营上，社员需要什么，他们就经营什么。夏天需要ＤＤＴ，他们为了给社员省钱，买了汽油和药粉自己配制，比市价便宜百分之六十二。社员反映煤不好烧，马上就找煤厂查问究竟，该退就退，不怕麻烦。最重要的是模范作用，“工作在先，享受在后”，任何东西都是社员买了以后他们才买。还有社员小组长也自觉地抽出时间来帮助卖货，对于社务的开展起了很大作用。社员反映说：“合作社的人态度真好，能办事，大公无私。”
    二、和行政上，职工会及市总社的联系密切。
    公司行政上对合作社帮助很大，社址家具都是公司筹借的，每次运粮都借给车；并协助合作社的资金周转，随时存款借款；发工资时并给合作社代扣货款。
    职工会和合作社的关系更密切，劳保部三个委员，都是合作社的社务委员。合作社有什么困难，职工会就想办法帮助解决；合作社也经常向职工会作书面和口头汇报。
    合作社对于总社的各种指示十分重视，或马上执行或交社委会讨论。如总社指示组织家属生产，便在社委会详细讨论了，第一步先实行了代卖家庭副产品。有不明白的问题，就虚心的向总社请示。如最近就请示了两个问题：（一）合作社对内贸易应否贴印花？（二）可否对买货最多的社员给予物质奖励？
    三、资金周转灵活，业务经营中尽量为社员谋福利。
    他们的业务方针是：（一）为社员谋便利；（二）实物保本；（三）不依赖厂方；（四）价格随时调整；（五）为社员家庭副产品谋销路；（六）尽量避免用现款买卖。
    由于目前粮食公司和合作总社的扶植，粮食可赊十天。日用品赊七天，实际上就等于代销，增大了资金的实际效率。因此可把货物赊给社员，使社员随时可得到粮煤及日用品的供给，这样就增大了社员的购货率。（六月份社员购货额占全部工资的百分之二一·五，七月份增到百分之三○）。
    他们没有本位主义和投机行为，每月给社员发购粮登记表，按统计数字去买粮。其他货品也是快卖完了就赶紧去搞第二批，货到又很快的卖出去，既不间断物品的供应，又活泼了资金的周转，从薄利多销中购回实物，保本之外还有盈余，逐渐扩大合作社的经济基础。该社自五月二十三日至六月底计盈余二六一、五四三·七五元，折合小米四八七○斤。
    另外，为了给社员谋便利，合作社找到一家质量最好的电磨进行食粮加工；从总社煤炭厂买了二百吨末煤换成煤球，五百斤以上就给送到社员家里。
    赊货方式是该社最成功的一点经验，从发工资的第二天起即可赊货，由赊货人签名盖章，到每月十四号或二十八号，合作社干部把各种货价打听清楚，把每个人赊的货划价算出总数，再把各部门欠款总数列表交到会计科一下扣清。这样社员平时无钱可以买货，合作社省了点票或讨帐，会计科在发薪时也可少支付许多现金，少向银行提款。如果全市各机关、工厂都这样执行起来，即可减少发薪时的市面通货数量，对于市场物价之平稳可起相当作用。
    四、初步实现了民主管理
    自来水公司在解放前是有个合作社的，但人员是厂方派的，业务经营也不合乎社员需要。今天的合作社则大大不同，干部全是民主选举的，并有较完善的一套组织系统。社员大会下面有三十九个代表组成的社员代表会（社员每十人至十五人推代表一人），代表会每月开会一次，反映社员要求，确定业务方针及其他重要事项，合作社干部在大会上报告业务情况，并将帐目交代表会审查公布。执行社务的是社务委员会，委员七人，四人由代表会产生，三人是工会劳保委员。社委会规定两星期开会一次，并常开临时会，凡是重大一些的社务，都通过社委会。
    小组长（即社员代表）在社员与合作社之间真正起了桥梁作用。一方面向社员宣传合作社的性质，解释工作上的问题；同时又代表社员利益，搜集并反映意见给合作社，能办的就办，不能办的向社员解释，小组长经常到合作社把货物品名价格抄下来传达给社员，有时还带给货样。社员中好多怀疑的问题，经过小组长耐心解释后，也就没意见了。
    在上述这种民主集中的管理之下，社员和社干都亲如家人，因为过去他们都是多年的老伙伴，今天被选为自己的代表，替自己谋利益，所以大家都把合作社认成是自己的。每逢运来粮食，工人们只要知道了都跑来帮助卸车。有一次一群外勤工人刚回公司，正要坐下休息，听说合作社粮食来了马上都去帮忙，一刻钟就把两万斤粮食卸完了。有一个工人说：“现在的合作社真正保障了社员的利益，能买到便宜东西，不比分红更好吗？合作社赚了钱不也是拿来给大家谋利益吗？”这句话是代表了多数人的意见，因为他们从实际行动中，确实体会到了新合作社的精神和实质。现全公司职工四七○人中，合作社社员已达到四六八人，只有两个临时工没有入社，连家属社员共一一九九人。每月需粮的百分之九十以上都由合作社供给。总起来说：这个合作社的基本优点，是干部热情工作虚心和联系群众。但还存在着下列缺点，需要克服：
    一、帐目不能及时结出：原因是整天都卖货，没有固定的足够的结帐时间。但帐目不能按时结出，就不能及时了解资金和负债的具体情况，直接影响业务经营，这问题应该在社员代表会上讨论，明确规定出每天的卖货和结帐时间。
    二、个别社干，在营业中有时“通融”，就影响到整个工作制度的坚持。
    三、宣传教育工作不够。因之尚有少数社员仍用旧的眼光来看合作社，用对待商人的态度来对待合作社干部，这是需要用加强对社员的教育来克服的。
    四、干部学习很差：社干多是事务工作者出身，缺少学习习惯，合作社工作又很忙，他们还不能很好的利用时间学习，因之就不会把政治理论和业务知识提高一步，这就会影响今后工作的进一步开展，必须大力克服。
