　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 20th: Budapest dispatch: The Hungarian Parliament, after hearing Rakosi's report on the draft constitution of the Hungarian People's Republic on the 17th, held two days of discussions and finally passed the constitution at the meeting on the 18th. TASS reported that at the meeting on the 17th, Workers' Party member of parliament Losonczy said: The draft constitution fully conforms to the spirit of the entire history of the Hungarian people's liberation struggle. Our country can be independent and free because the traitorous reactionaries have been driven away and the power has been handed over to the working people. Smallholder Party member of parliament Mihalfi said the constitution is built on the traditions of the Hungarian people's liberation struggle. National Peasant Party member of parliament Nanasi said: Based on the constitution, the Hungarian people will advance along the path of progress.
　　Debate continued on the 18th. Progressive Party member of parliament Ferencszal endorsed the draft constitution and said: The independence of the Hungarian People's Republic is primarily due to the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union and its leader, Marshal Stalin. Serkei, representing the working peasants, welcomed the draft constitution. Professor Lizniak, representing intellectuals, Bela Salai, representing youth, and Colonel Balilku, representing officers and soldiers of the Hungarian People's Army, unanimously supported the draft constitution. At this point, Deputy Speaker of Parliament Molnar announced that all speakers in the debate had agreed with the draft constitution and proposed that Parliament decide to pass the draft constitution. All members of parliament immediately stood up and applauded in favor of the draft constitution. When the chairman announced that the constitution of the Hungarian People's Republic had been formally passed, the members of parliament once again stood up, applauding and cheering enthusiastically, paying tribute to Rakosi, the leader of the Hungarian people.
　　The Parliament also passed a decree on various interim regulations related to the entry into force of the constitution.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 20th: TASS Budapest dispatch: At the meeting of the Hungarian Parliament on the 17th, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Rakosi, on behalf of the Political and Constitutional Committee, made a report on the draft constitution of the Hungarian People's Republic. In reporting on the work of the Constitution Drafting Committee, Rakosi pointed out: The committee strived to embody in the constitution all the achievements already made by the Hungarian people. The draft constitution not only consolidates the achievements already won, but also proposes the path for further development. The drafting of the constitution was based on the changes that have taken place in Hungary since the liberation of Hungary by the Soviet army—the working class's ruling power, the nationalization of 91 percent of industry, land reform, etc. Then Rakosi pointed out that Hungary has embarked on the socialist path in every sector of the national economy.
　　In pointing out the characteristics of the current Hungarian state system, Rakosi emphasized: In Hungary, the entire power belongs to the working people. Therefore, the basis of the social system of the Hungarian People's Republic as stipulated in the draft constitution is labor, and the rights, obligations, and honor of every healthy citizen are a matter of doing one's best. The Hungarian People's Republic guarantees citizens' rights to work, rest, and education. The draft constitution was drafted to eliminate the exploiting classes and further consolidate the society composed of the friendly alliance of the worker and peasant classes. State power in Hungary belongs to the working people, and here, the leading role is played by the more developed, more organized, and more class-conscious working class.
　　Rakosi went on to point out that the draft constitution proceeds from the principle of equality of all nationalities and races, and it is thoroughly democratic. It not only declares the rights of citizens, but also guarantees the real realization of these rights. The draft constitution recognizes equality between men and women, protects the interests of youth, and provides youth with all conditions for development. The draft constitution protects property acquired through labor, guarantees freedom of belief, and thus stipulates the separation of state and church. The draft constitution protects marriage and the family.
　　Rakosi, in narrating the newspaper comments after the publication of the draft constitution, said: The working people of Hungary accepted the draft constitution with great enthusiasm. The people of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries have expressed their approval. As for the imperialists, they naturally do not like the draft constitution, but I must emphasize that the goal of our Constitution Drafting Committee is not to please the imperialists.
　　Rakosi then elaborated on the suggestions for revising the draft constitution, and finally asked the members of parliament to discuss and pass the draft constitution.

　　匈牙利议会通过宪草
    拉科西指出新政权属于劳动人民保证民族民主权利消灭阶级剥削
    【新华社北平二十日电】布达佩斯讯：匈牙利议会十七日听取拉科西关于匈牙利人民共和国宪法草案的报告后，进行两日讨论，在十八日会上最后通过该宪法。塔斯社报道，十七日会上工人党议员洛松齐发言说：宪法草案完全符合于匈牙利人民解放斗争全部历史的精神。我们的国家能够独立自由，是由于叛国的反动派已被赶走，政权已交给了劳动人民。小农党的议员米哈菲维说宪法是建立在匈牙利人民解放斗争的传统之上的。国家农民党的议员纳纳西说：以宪法为基础，匈牙利人民将循进步的道路前进。
    十八日继续辩论，急进党议员费连查勒赞同宪草，并说：匈牙利人民共和国之取得独立，首先要归功于苏联及其领袖斯大林大元帅的友谊帮助。塞尔盖代表劳动农民欢迎宪草，利兹尼雅克教授代表知识分子、贝拉萨莱代表青年、巴利尔库上校代表匈牙利人民军的官兵一致拥护宪草。至此，议会副议长莫尔纳即宣布在辩论中全体发言人都赞同宪草，并提议议会对宪草通过决定。全体议员当即起立，鼓掌赞同宪草。当主席宣布匈牙利人民共和国的宪法正式通过时，议员们再次起立，热烈鼓掌、欢呼，向匈牙利人民领袖拉科西致敬。
    议会又通过与该宪法生效有关的各项暂行条例的法令。
    【新华社北平二十日电】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈议会十七日会上，部长会议副主席拉科西代表政治与制宪委员会作了关于匈牙利人民共和国宪法草案的报告。拉科西在报告宪草委员会的工作时指出：委员会力求在宪法中体现匈牙利人民已经达成的一切成就。宪草不仅巩固了已赢得的成就，而且也提出了进一步发展的道路。宪草的拟订工作是根据苏军解放匈牙利以来的时期中匈国所发生的变革——工人阶级的执政、工业百分之九十一的国有化、土地改革等——着手进行的。然后拉氏指出，匈牙利在国民经济的每一部门中都已走上了社会主义的道路。
    拉科西在指出现时匈牙利国家制度的特点时强调称：在匈牙利，整个政权属于劳动人民。因此宪草中规定匈牙利人民共和国社会制度的基础是劳动，每一个健壮公民的权利、义务以及名誉攸关的问题是各尽所能。匈牙利人民共和国保证公民的工作、休息、与受教育的权利。宪草的拟订是为了消灭剥削阶级和进一步巩固由工人与农民两个友好联盟的阶级组成的社会。匈国政权属于劳动人民，在这里，起领导作用的是更加发展、更有组织和有更高的阶级觉悟的工人阶级。
    拉科西进而指出宪法草案从一切民族与种族平等的原则出发，它是彻底的民主的，它不仅宣布公民的权利，并且保障这些权利的真正实现。宪法草案认可男女平等，维护青年的利益，给予青年以发展的一切条件。宪草保护由劳动获得的财产，保证信仰的自由，并且从而规定国家与教会分离。宪草保护婚姻和家庭。
    拉科西叙述宪法草案公布后报纸的评论时说：匈牙利的劳动人民，以巨大的热情来接受宪法草案。苏联和各人民民主国家的人民都表示赞成。至于帝国主义者，宪草自然是不为他们所喜欢的，然而我必须强调，我们宪草委员会的目标并不是求得帝国主义者的欢心。
    拉科西继详论关于修改宪草的建议，最后要求议员们讨论并通过宪草。
