Tang Liang, in his report on reorganization and streamlining, specifically explained the four reasons why reorganization is necessary now. He said: First, the environment of large cities requires us to organize our agencies and work according to the characteristics and needs of the cities. Some organizations should be abolished, some should be established, some should be reduced and merged, and some should be expanded. If we do not quickly change the old ways, we will not be able to adapt to the urban environment. Second, after the takeover work in the cities comes to an end, the important task now is to strengthen rural work, connect urban and rural areas, and expand the work from points and lines to the whole area. In the early days of the liberation of the cities, it was very necessary to concentrate a large number of cadres to carry out takeover work, but today, with the takeover work basically completed, it is necessary to draw some cadres and mobilize some workers and educated youths in the cities to carry out rural work. Third, there are also problems of overlapping organizations and cumbersome procedures in our institutions, which affect the enthusiasm of cadres to work, and need to be improved. Fourth, we have now achieved a great victory, but in the victory we have also encountered some serious difficulties in finance and economy. On the one hand, we must continue to complete the thorough victory of the Liberation War, and on the other hand, we must begin production and construction, which requires us to consider how to open up new sources of income and reduce expenditure as much as possible, tighten expenditures, reduce waste, and ensure the needs of the front line and production and construction. He proposed that in the reorganization work, we should carry out thorough mobilization and explanation, adopt a serious and responsible attitude, and improve our work through reorganization. Vice Mayor Ke Qingshi, after putting forward many specific plans for implementing economy, especially called on the cadres of the agencies to use the large amount of open space in Nanjing to engage in public after-hours production, mainly agriculture, to increase income and improve life. All departments should also check the received materials to avoid losses. Finally, he said: "The government is determined to send many citizens of Nanjing who have productive capacity but nowhere to use it back to their hometowns for production. From urban life to rural life, this is a painful process for them, but through this process they can have enough food and clothing."
    [By Our Correspondent] Nanjing News: In order to ensure the victorious development of reorganization and economy, the Nanjing Reorganization and Economy Work Committee has been formally established, with Su Yu, Tang Liang, Chen Shiqu, etc. and one person designated by the Second Field Army, a total of eleven members, as members, and Su Yu and Tang Liang as the chief and deputy directors. The committee has three institutions under it: the Reorganization Group, the Production and Economy Group, and the Real Estate Management Committee. The committee has officially started working, and the party, government, military, and people's organizations in the city have entered the preliminary mobilization stage. The Reorganization Group, led by Comrade Tang Liang, has held its second meeting and decided that all units should merge similar institutions, all office staff should be used uniformly, and all levels of the municipal government should concentrate on office work in the short term.

    唐亮报告指出
    整编精简四个原因
    唐亮在作整编精简工作报告时，特别说明目前为什么要整编的四个原因。他说，一、大城市的环境要求我们按城市的特点和需要来组织自己的机关和工作，有的组织应取消，有的应成立，有的应缩并，有的还要扩大。如果不迅速改变旧的一套，就不能适应城市环境。二、在城市中当按管工作告一段落后，目前的重要任务是加强农村工作，沟通城乡关系，把工作由点线而推展到面。城市解放初期，集中大批干部进行接管工作是非常必要的，但今天接管工作已初步完成，就需要在城市中抽出一些干部和动员一些工人和知识青年，去开展农村工作。三、在我们的机构中也存在着组织重叠、手续繁琐的毛病，影响干部发挥工作积极性，需要加以改进。四、现在我们一方面是取得了伟大的胜利，但在胜利中在财政经济上也遭遇了一些严重的困难。我们一面要继续完成解放战争的彻底胜利，一方面要开始生产建设，这就需要我们考虑如何尽可能地开源节流，紧缩开支，减少浪费，保证前线和生产建设的需要。他提出在整编工作中要很好地进行深入的动员解释工作，采取严肃负责的态度；并从整编中来健全我们的机关工作。柯庆施副市长在提出许多执行节约的具体方案后，特别号召机关干部利用南京大量的空地，从事以农业为主的公余生产，以增加收入，改善生活。各部门并应清查接收物资，勿使损失。最后，他说：“政府决心遣送南京许多有生产能力而无用武之地的市民回乡生产。从城市生活到农村生活，这对他们是个痛苦的过程，但通过这个过程他们就可以丰衣足食了。”
    【本报讯】南京消息：为保证整编节约的胜利开展，南京市整编节约工作委员会业已正式成立，推定粟裕、唐亮、陈士渠等及第二野战军指定之一人共十一人为委员，粟裕、唐亮为正副主任委员。该会下设整编组、生产节约组、房产管理委员会三机构。该会已正式开始办公，全市党、政、军民机关团体已进入初步动员阶段。整编小组由唐亮同志领导，已开过第二次会，决定各单位要合并同类机构，各机关勤杂人员要统一使用，市政府各级规定在短期内一律集中办公。
