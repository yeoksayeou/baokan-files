    Strengthen Economic Accounting Systems and Oppose Production Waste
    Decision Released by the Northeast Industry Department
    [This newspaper] Strengthening the economic accounting system and launching a struggle against waste is a central link in the management of the state-owned economy in the Northeast. The Industry Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee promulgated a decision on July 29. After inspecting the work of various bureaus, factories, and mines, the department believes that there is widespread, serious, and alarming waste in state-owned industries, resulting in great losses to state property. The formation of waste phenomena is due to some production equipment not being well-equipped, the specific production plan not being well-integrated with the ordering plan, and the untimely supply of raw materials, thus hindering production; Many production units have poor production process organization, and have failed to formulate a relatively complete production quota and specific technical standards, resulting in low quality, many defective products, and universally high consumption standards, resulting in serious material waste; Some are due to poor labor organization and large and multi-layered organizational structures, resulting in low labor productivity and great waste of manpower; Some are due to poor organization of sales agencies and blindness in production, resulting in product backlog and slow capital turnover; Some enterprises even fail to implement the budget system in a practical way, and do not make budgets based on planned costs and certain projects, and make regular final accounts to manage and supervise production to reduce costs and save expenses. On the contrary, budgeting is done to get more investment and cash from the state, and final accounting is done to demand higher prices. The decision pointed out that the above unreasonable phenomena are mainly due to the fact that many of our leading cadres have not deeply realized the importance of reducing costs and promoting the economic accounting system, and its significant relationship to the restoration and development of Northeast industry and the improvement of people's lives, coupled with a lack of cost management concepts and a relatively complete economic accounting management system, so many enterprises still do not have real and accurate costs; Secondly, it is because they are not good at using planned economy to manage economic accounting, and do not understand that the clear provisions of production business management and economic management tasks are an important key to achieving increased labor productivity, promoting economic accounting systems, reducing costs, and accumulating state capital; Thirdly, because leading cadres have not deeply studied production business, have not organized production processes well, have not accurately calculated various quotas and costs, and have not established a responsibility system at work, they cannot see the seriousness of the waste phenomenon. In order to truly lay the foundation for the economic accounting system, the following preparatory work must be done: (1) Conduct a concrete survey of existing production equipment and production capacity to determine how to maximize its production capacity; (2) Thoroughly clear assets, determine fixed and current assets, and study the turnover rate of current assets; (3) Stipulate various quotas as a basis for checking and improving work; (4) Establish production statistics and budgeting systems. Establish a real cost accounting system. As for the central task of various factories and mines in economic accounting at present, the decision pointed out that the main task is to strive to reduce costs, improve quality, and launch a mass anti-waste campaign. To this end, it is necessary to correctly equip machines and equipment, organize production in a planned way, organize labor reasonably, stipulate labor discipline, improve worker skills, launch a meritorious competition campaign, implement a correct wage system, and greatly increase labor productivity to meet the standards of production quotas, technical quotas, and material consumption quotas. Finally, the decision calls on all workers, technicians, and staff to launch a struggle against waste, launch a rationalization proposal campaign, promote the high patriotism of employees, actively improve production protection and conserve state resources, and strive to achieve the task of reducing costs by 5% to 10% in the first step in the second half of the year.

    加强经济核算制度  反对生产浪费现象
    东北工业部发布决定
    【本报讯】加强经济核算制开展反对浪费斗争，是目前东北国营经济管理上的中心一环，东北行政委员会工业部已于七月二十九日颁布决定。该部于检查各局厂矿工作后，认为目前国营工业中存在着普遍的、严重的、惊人的浪费，造成了国家财产的莫大损失。浪费现象的形成有的是由于因某些生产设备配备不好，具体的生产计划与订货计划结合得不好，原料供应不及时，因而妨碍了生产；有不少生产单位则因生产过程组织不好，未能制订一个比较完整的生产定额和具体的技术标准，故质量低、废品多、普遍的消耗标准高，材料严重浪费；有的则因劳力组织不好，及组织机构庞大层次多，故劳动生产率低，形成人力很大的浪费；有的是由于推销机关组织不好，及生产上的盲目性，至使产品积压，资金周转慢；甚至有些企业单位对预决算制不切实，不是根据计划成本与一定工程去作预算，并定期作出决算，进行生产的管理与监督，以降低成本与节约开支，相反作预算为了向国家多领投资与现金，作决算为了要求提高物价。上述不合理现象的产生，该决定指出：主要是由于我们许多领导干部没有深刻认识到降低成本推行经济核算制的重要性，和对于东北工业恢复发展与人民生活改善的重大关系，加之缺乏成本管理观念与比较完整的经济核算的管理制度，故至今很多企业单位没有真正的确实的成本；其次是由于还不善于运用计划经济去进行对经济核算的管理，不了解生产业务管理与经济管理的任务的明显规定，乃是达到提高劳动生产率、推行经济核算制、降低成本与积累国家资本的重要关键；第三是因为领导干部未深入钻研生产业务，未很好组织生产过程，未精确计算各种定额及成本，未建立起工作上的责任制，因此看不出浪费现象的严重。为了真正打下经济核算制的基础，则必须做好下列准备工作：（一）对现有生产设备及生产能力作具体的调查，以便确定如何发挥其生产能力；（二）彻底清理资产，确定固定与流动资产，研究流动资产的周转率；（三）规定各种定额，作为检查与提高工作的依据；（四）建立生产上的统计与预决算制度。建立真正的成本会计制度。至于目前各厂矿在经济核算上的中心任务，决定指出主要是努力降低成本，提高质量，开展群众性的反浪费运动。为此，必须正确的配备机器设备，有计划的组织生产，合理的组织劳动力，规定劳动纪律，提高工人技术，开展立功竞赛运动，实行正确的工资制度，大大提高劳动生产率，以达到生产定额、技术定额与材料消耗定额的标准。最后，决定号召全体工人、技术人员、职员，开展反浪费斗争，开展合理化的建议运动，发扬职工的高度的爱国主义，积极提高生产保护与节约国家资材，为实现下半年内第一步降低成本百分之五至百分之十的任务而奋斗。
