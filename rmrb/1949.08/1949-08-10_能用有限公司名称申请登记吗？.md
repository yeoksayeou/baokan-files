Can a Limited Liability Company Name Be Used to Apply for Registration?

To the Editor:

I am a small businessman, and I am currently planning to start a small-scale industrial or commercial business with three or four other people. However, our own funds are limited, and we intend to raise some capital from relatives and friends to reach a certain amount before we can plan our business operations. The investors require that they have limited liability, and we individuals also want limited liability. I would like to know if applying for business registration using a limited liability company name would be permitted?

Liu Xin

Mr. Liu Xin:

In principle, applying to establish a limited liability company is permissible. However, the new Company Law has not yet been promulgated by the government. It is best to first apply for registration as an ordinary business based on the "Provisional Measures for Industrial and Commercial Business Registration." After the new Company Law is promulgated, then register as a company.

If you must apply for registration as a limited liability company now, you can temporarily follow these procedures: Prepare a petition, attach two copies each of the company's articles of association, business plan, and a list of the names and resumes of the founders, and apply for registration. If it is established by raising shares, you must also attach a prospectus.

    能用有限公司名称申请登记吗？编辑同志：
    我是一个小商人，现在想纠合三、四人做一个小本工业或商业，但是我们自己资金有限，欲由亲友方面募集一些，凑成一个数目而后才能计划营业，然而投资的人要求必须负有限责任，而我们各个人也是想用有限责任，不知道如用有限公司名称申请营业登记能否给予许可？刘新刘新先生：
    呈请设立股份有限公司，在原则上是许可的；不过新公司法，尚未经政府公布，最好先按“工商业声请登记暂行办法”之规定，以普通商号性质，申请登记，俟新公司法公布后，再为公司之登记。
    如必欲于现在申请为有限公司之登记，可暂依如下手续：备具呈文，附呈公司章程、营业计划书、发起人姓名履历清册各二份，申请登记。如系招股设立，并须附具招股章程。（北平市人民政府工商局）
