　　Participating in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
  　Clothing Factory No. 2 Launches Signature Campaign
    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to respond to the call of the Municipal Party Committee and develop Sino-Soviet friendship, the Beiping Clothing Factory No. 2 convened a general meeting of all employees at 7 p.m. on the 29th. Comrade Ka Di, the secretary of the factory's branch, conveyed Comrade Peng Zhen's report on Sino-Soviet relations, and called on all employees to respond to the call of the Municipal Party Committee and support the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Yesterday (30th), the factory also launched a signature campaign. The employees were enthusiastic and signed their names one after another. In one day, more than 90% of the workers had signed. They said: We will always stand with the Soviet Union. Any trick of imperialism is useless. In addition, the factory held a meeting of Party and League members last Monday, deciding to promote and publicize to the employees of each unit separately, and strengthen the internationalist education of the employees. It is now continuing to carry out in-depth publicity, so as to enable all employees to truly realize the important significance of "workers of the world are one family."
