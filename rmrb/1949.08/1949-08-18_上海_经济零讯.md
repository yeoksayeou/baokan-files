　　Shanghai Economic News Snippets
    People's Bank Instructions
  　Simplify Business Procedures and Change Work Style
    ▲The Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank recently issued work instructions to its 38 offices and collection points, stating that each collection point should, based on actual work, pay attention to the arrangement and simplification of order at collection locations and payment procedures. Do not make payers wait in line for a long time in the hot weather. Teller personnel should improve work efficiency and maintain the excellent quality of the People's Bank with a humble attitude, overcome bureaucratic work styles, and truly serve the people.
    Methods for Collecting Funds from Other Places Will Change
    ▲Since the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank started handling the collection of funds from other places on the 26th of last month, up to the 10th of this month, it has collected more than 307 million RMB, most of which are funds entrusted by industrial and commercial enterprises to purchase production equipment, raw materials, and sell goods (chemicals, cigarettes) to regulate capital.
    In order to avoid time-consuming telegraphic transfers, the bank is planning to entrust its correspondent banks in other places to automatically collect funds on a regular basis. Industrial and commercial enterprises that frequently have funds transferred from other places to Shanghai can sign an agreement with the bank to agree on an amount, and the bank will notify its correspondent banks in other places to automatically collect the funds when the time comes, without being restricted by the local remittance limit. The collection fee will be calculated in Shanghai according to the exchange rate of the collecting bank on the date of collection. Pilot projects have now begun in Ningbo, Hankou, and other places.
    Investigation of Raw Material Usage in Various Industries and Factories
    ▲The Research Office of the East China Foreign Trade Administration, in order to understand the situation of various industries and factories responding to the call to change production direction and adopt domestic raw materials as part of the six major tasks, will conduct a survey and statistics on the foreign and domestic raw materials required by various industries and factories, in order to further guide and assist them.

　　上海　经济零讯
    人民银行指示
  　简化业务手续改变工作作风
    ▲人民银行上海分行日前对所属三十八个办事处收款处发出工作指示，内称各收款处应根据实际工作，对收款地点之秩序及缴款手续，注意布置与简化，勿使缴款人长时间在炎热的气候下到队中等候。出纳人员应提高工作效率，在态度上尤应谦和以保持人民银行之优良品质，克服官僚主义作风，真正做到为人民服务。
    代收外埠款项方式将有改变
    ▲人民银行上海分行，自上月二十六日起开办代收外埠款项以来，迄至本月十日止，已代收人民币三亿零七百多万元，其中大多为工商业委托代收购买生产器材、原料、销售货物（化工、纸烟）等调剂资金的款项。
    更为了避免托收电报往返费时，该行正筹划委托外埠各联行经常自动代收款项。凡经常有款项从外埠调沪的工商业，都可以和该行订立协议书，商定额度，由该行通知外埠各联行到时自动代收，不受当地汇款限额的限制。代收手续费按收妥日收款行申汇汇率在沪计收。现宁波、汉口等地已开始试办。
    调查各业各厂采用原料情况
    ▲华东区国外贸易管理局调查研究室为了了解各业各厂配合六大任务中改变生产方向，采用国产原料的号召情形，即将对各业各厂所需用之国外原料及国产原料进行调查统计，以便进一步设法加以指导和协助。
