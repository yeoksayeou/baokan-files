    Stealing Public Grain for Illegal Business Operations
    Yongda Flour Mill Shut Down
    Manager Liang Jingxi and Others Sentenced to Three Years in Prison
    [Reported by this newspaper] Yongda Flour Mill, located on Baozi Street, Xidan, was found to have stolen public grain and illegally purchased gold and silver. After a trial by the Municipal People's Court, the mill has been sealed off, and the manager, Liang Jingxi, and others have been sentenced to imprisonment. Yongda Flour Mill applied to the Grain Branch of the Municipal Trading Company in February to act as an agent for grain processing. After signing the contract, it failed to comply earnestly, skimping on materials and labor. The Trading Company warned them once, and the mill wrote a letter of repentance, promising to correct their ways in the future. However, they still failed to deliver all the processed flour on time. On June 3rd, the Trading Company inspected the mill and discovered that more than 71,800 jin of the company's wheat had been stolen and sold. After a detailed check of the accounts, it was also found that the mill had stolen and sold more than 71,500 jin of corn entrusted by the Civil Affairs Bureau for processing, and more than 9,900 jin of coarse rice from the Supply Bureau, earning a total of more than 2.8 million yuan, most of which was used to purchase gold (22 taels), silver dollars, and cloth, rice, and flour. The three organizations jointly requested the Second District Government to send the entire case to the People's Court for handling. After the court's trial, the mill has been sealed off to compensate the three organizations for the public grain. At the same time, the mill's manager, Liang Jingxi, deputy manager Liang Jianwen, and accounting director Wang Xuzhang, were jointly convicted of conspiring to sell public grain and engaging in illegal business operations, and each was sentenced to three years of imprisonment.
