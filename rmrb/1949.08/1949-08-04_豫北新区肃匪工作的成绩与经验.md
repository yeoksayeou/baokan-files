    Achievements and Experiences in Suppressing Bandits in the Yubei New District
    Taihang District Party Committee Office
    I. General Situation of Bandit Suppression in Yubei

    The newly liberated areas of Taihang include: Xinxiang and Anyang cities in northern Henan. Most or part of the thirteen counties of Wuzhi, Xiuwu, Huojia, Bo'ai, Xinxiang, Huixian, Jixian, Jiaozuo, Qi County, Anyang, Zhinan, Ye County, and Tangyin. There are a total of 1,807 administrative villages with a population of over 1.57 million, accounting for 45% of the total number of administrative villages and population in Yubei. During the enemy and puppet occupation of these areas, they systematically used various relationships to win over, train, and organize various bandits and special agents. Before liberation, they consciously hid and dispersed them throughout the areas to undermine our people's democratic order and various production and construction efforts. This presented the Party and the people of Yubei with the urgent task of suppressing bandits after liberation. The February meeting of the District Party Committee pointed out to the newly liberated and recovered areas: bandit suppression should be carried out while developing the great production movement, and the purpose of bandit suppression is to protect production. For the past six months, the Fourth and Fifth Prefectural Committees of Yubei and various counties have adhered to and implemented this policy, thus achieving considerable results. According to incomplete statistics from twelve counties and two cities: (1) 11,094 enemy and puppet military personnel, scattered bandits, and special agents registered with the government, including 767 Kuomintang members and Sanqing Tuan members. 1,849 of these, from five counties, underwent our short-term education and transformation. (2) 8,791 enemy and puppet firearms (including rifles, pistols, eight-sound guns, ten-shot repeaters, and Mauser pistols) were seized, along with over 53,000 rounds of various bullets and shells, and 20 large and small cannons. (3) Enemy and puppet regime institutions were destroyed, and people's democratic regimes at all levels were established. According to statistics from Wuzhi County, 80% of the village regimes in the county have been transformed. At the same time, a large number of activists emerged in various places during the bandit suppression and in conjunction with the initial social reform movement, laying a reliable foundation for further mobilizing the masses and carrying out work. (4) Active investigation and case solving were carried out against hidden and lurking special agent organizations, and 15 major cases were solved by us. Judging from the above situation, thanks to the Party's correct leadership and active mobilization of the masses in the bandit suppression work, and after eight months of efforts, the remnants of bandits and puppets have been largely eliminated. As a result, the masses have gained a relatively stable production environment. However, the progress of bandit suppression work in various places is not balanced. The specific situation can be roughly divided into two categories of areas: One is the original Fourth Sub-district area, including Jiaozuo, Xiuwu, Huojia, and Wuzhi, which were liberated last autumn. As a result of the major bandit suppression campaign last winter and the combination of bandit suppression in this year's production movement, most of the enemy and puppet personnel have registered, most of the guns have been handed over, and the bandits and puppets have been largely eliminated. After the movement, the masses have been initially mobilized, and a democratic order has been established. However, we must pay close attention and be vigilant, because these areas have not yet implemented land reform, the mobilization of the masses is still very poor, and the social roots of the bandits and puppets have not been eradicated fundamentally. Recently, it has been discovered that openly registered bad elements are still constantly engaged in secret activities. In particular, the Jiaozuo explosion incident that occurred in late June should serve as a lesson. Therefore, Party and government at all levels must continue to work hard to mobilize the masses and implement bandit suppression. At present, we should mainly combine this with the initial social reforms (burden reform and rent reduction movement). The other category is the areas around Anyang and Xinxiang, which were liberated in April this year. Although some achievements have been made in the two-month bandit suppression campaign, due to the short time and insufficient mobilization of the masses, bandits and special agents are still continuing to carry out sabotage activities such as spreading rumors, robbing roads, setting fires, assassinations, and instigating armed struggles. Recently, in Xinxiang, Tangyin, Anyang, Qi County, and Ye County, groups of plainclothes and armed scattered bandits have been found, even impersonating the People's Liberation Army, causing social unrest in some areas. This must arouse our serious attention. In the implementation of the year's great production movement and the current social reform, we must vigorously mobilize the masses to quickly and thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandits in order to achieve the goal of stabilizing social order and protecting production.

    II. Four Lessons Learned in the Bandit Suppression Movement

    1. Correctly publicize the Party's policy towards die-hard bandit personnel and deal with them separately according to the specific circumstances of the die-hard bandit personnel, in order to achieve the goal of disintegration and division of the enemy and puppets. In this movement, all localities have firmly grasped the spirit of punishing the ringleaders, not questioning the coerced, and rewarding meritorious service, thus greatly enhancing the Party's influence after the handling. For example, recently in Xinxiang, a court was jointly organized by the Taihang and Jilu-Yu Administrative Offices to try and execute Wang Sanzhu, a habitual bandit leader in northern Henan, which greatly pleased the people. The general die-hard puppet personnel felt our leniency and launched an automatic registration, mutual persuasion, and family and friend persuasion movement, expressing their determination to abandon evil and return to righteousness, which greatly facilitated the progress of the bandit suppression work. At the same time, in the bandit suppression movement, the struggle on two fronts has always been carried out and implemented, correcting and overcoming: the right-leaning mistake of thinking that registration is a panacea and the right-leaning mistake of simply collecting weapons by any means without distinguishing between different situations.

    2. Implementing the organization of the masses to overcome famine in the bandit suppression movement has gained strong support for the bandit suppression work. Because the masses in the urban areas under the long-term rule of the enemy and puppets suffered greatly, and they urgently demanded production after liberation. In this movement, Party and government at all levels seized this link, on the one hand mobilizing the masses to suppress bandits, and on the other hand organizing the masses to produce for self-rescue. Governments at all levels provided necessary assistance, overcoming the severe famine created by the enemy and puppets over the years, which greatly satisfied the masses, especially in Xiuwu, Jiaozuo and other counties. According to statistics from four districts: 244 handicraft industries and workshops have been restored, and the masses have been organized to pull coal for transportation. Jiaozuo County alone earned more than 720,000 catties of wheat in half a month. Xiuwu organized women to spin and weave, and established a few cooperatives through production for self-rescue. In this way, in actual experience, the masses realized that only the Communist Party is truly for the people, and expressed strong hatred for the Kuomintang reactionaries who caused serious disasters to the people, and their class consciousness rapidly increased. In addition, enemy and puppet sabotage incidents continued to occur in this year's production movement. For example, in the spring, the canals and agricultural tools in × county were destroyed by enemy and puppets. During the summer harvest, incidents of burning wheat and robbing wheat occurred in Caiyuan and Daxing in Districts 4, 5, and 1 of Tangyin County; and Caogou and Houtun in Lunzhang and Zhangxie in Anyang. According to the statistics of the Fifth Military Sub-district, the masses lost more than 800 mu of land during the summer harvest. These criminal activities stimulated the masses' enthusiasm for suppressing bandits, making them realize that they cannot concentrate on production until the enemy and puppet scattered bandits are completely eliminated. Therefore, under the slogan of protecting production and protecting social security, production security committees and wheat protection teams were established in various villages, and a patrolling system for protecting fields was organized. The masses consciously protected their own production.

    3. We must rely on the masses to suppress bandits, implement necessary social reforms, and initially mobilize the masses. Without this move to mobilize the masses to carry out bandit suppression and production, it will be difficult, and we will not find a reliable basis. Therefore, in the Yubei New District, while suppressing bandits and producing, we have implemented many necessary social reforms in conjunction with the demands of the masses, such as fair burden, rent reduction, and distribution of public land and temple property to the basic masses. This link has played a great role in mobilizing the masses to suppress bandits and establish democratic power.

    4. Establishing and improving regular public security organizations and various systems can guarantee and consolidate the victorious achievements of the bandit suppression work. Experience shows that although there are achievements in bandit suppression work, if we neglect regular public security and security work, it will inevitably lead to speculative activities by bad elements. The production security committees established in various places this year (some have security divisions under the production committees) have special personnel in charge, set up necessary meeting systems (paying attention not to waste people's power), regularly study public security work, establish household registration systems, conduct necessary treatment of individual bad elements, and often pay attention to educating registered personnel, organizing them into production, and providing necessary and possible solutions to the difficulties of some of them. All this will play a great role in the transformation and education of enemy and puppet personnel. Only with regular public security and security work, social order can be stable, and the masses can rest assured that production is guaranteed.

    豫北新区肃匪工作的成绩与经验
    太行区党委办公室
    一、豫北肃匪的一般情况
    太行新解放的地区包括：豫北之新乡、安阳两市。武陟、修武、获嘉、博爱、新乡、辉县、汲县、焦作、淇县、安阳、只南、邺县、汤阴等十三县的大部或少部。共计一千八百零七个行政村，人口一百五十七万余，占我豫北全部行政村与人口总数百分之四十五。这些地方敌伪占时曾有计划的利用各种关系，拉拢、训练、组织各种土匪特务，解放前更有意识的将他隐藏分散各地，破坏我人民民主秩序与各种生产建设。这样就给我豫北党与人民提出了解放后迫不容缓的肃匪工作。区党委二月会议对亦已解放的新区与恢复区指出：要在开展大生产运动中贯澈肃匪，肃匪的目的是为了保卫生产。六个月以来我豫北四、五地委及各县是坚持与贯彻了这一方针的，因而取得了相当成绩。据十二县、两市不完全的统计：（１）敌伪军人员、散匪、特务向政府登记者一万一千零九十四人，其中包括国民党员、三青团员七百六十七人，系五个县数经过我短期教育改造者，达一千八百四十九人。（２）收缴敌伪枪支（包括步枪、手枪、八音、十子连、抉把等）八千七百九十一枝，各种子弹、炮弹五万三千余发，大小炮二十门。（３）摧坏了敌伪政权机构，建立了各级人民民主政权。据武陟一县统计全县百分之八十村政权亦已改造，同时在肃匪和结合初步的社会改革运动中各地涌现出大量的积极分子，给进一步发动群众和开展工作，打下了可靠依托基础。（４）对隐藏潜伏而继续活动的特务组织，积极进行了侦察破案，计重大的案件为我破获者达十五件。从以上情况来看，由于党对肃匪工作正确领导与积极的发动群众，经过八个月努力，匪伪残余已大体肃清。因而群众能够获得了较安定的生产环境。但在各地肃匪工作进展的程度是不够平衡的。具体情况大体可分两类地区：一种是去秋解放的焦作、修武、获嘉、武陟等地即原四分区地区。由于经过去冬大的肃匪运动及今年生产运动中结合肃匪的结果；敌伪人员绝大部分进行登记了，大部分枪枝缴出了，匪伪大体上是肃清了。经过运动群众有了初步发动，民主秩序已经建立起来。但是还需十分注意，提高警惕，因为这类地区还没有实行土地改革，群众发动还很差，匪伪的社会根源还未从根本上铲除，最近已经发现公开登记的坏分子，还不断暗中活动。特别是六月下旬所发生的焦作爆炸事件应引为教，因此各级党与政府，必须继续努力发动群众贯彻肃匪。在目前主要应结合初步社会改革（负担改革与减租运动）进行之。另一种是今年四月解放的安阳、新乡两市及其周围地区，虽在两个月肃匪运动中取得了一些成绩，但由于时间短，群众发动不够充分，因此匪特还在继续进行造谣、劫路、放火、暗杀、策动会斗等破坏活动。最近新乡、汤阴、安阳、淇县、邺县等县，发现便衣与武装的成股散匪，甚至冒充人民解放军，造成了部分地区社会秩序不安。这一点必须引起我们严重注意，要在贯彻全年的大生产运动中与目前社会改革中，大力发动群众迅速、彻底肃清残匪以达到安定社会秩序与保卫生产的目的。
    二、肃匪运动中取得的四点经验
    一、正确宣传党对顽匪人员的政策，根据顽匪人员的具体情况，有分别的加以处理，以达瓦解分化敌伪的目的。这次运动各地都紧紧掌握了首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖精神办事，因此在处理后，党的影响大大提高。如最近在新乡由太行、冀鲁豫两行署联合组织了法庭，审判处决了豫北惯匪首王三祝，人心大快。对一般顽伪人员则感我宽大之谊，展开了自动登记，相互规劝，家友规劝运动，表示决心改邪归正，大大便利了肃匪工作的进展。同时在肃匪运动中，始终开展与贯彻了两条战线的斗争，纠正与克服了：认为登记便万事大吉的右倾错误与单纯搜集武器不择手段，不加分别处理的右倾错误。
    二、肃匪运动中贯彻组织了群众渡荒，取得对肃匪工作的有力支持。因为在敌伪长期统治下的市区，群众生活很痛苦，解放后迫切要求生产，这次运动中各级党与政府抓住了这一环，一方面发动群众肃匪，一方面组织了群众生产自救，各级政府给以必要的帮助，克服了历年来敌伪造下的严重灾荒，群众很满意，尤其在修武、焦作等县作的较好。据四个区统计：恢复手工业、作坊二百四十四座，组织群众拉煤运输，只焦作一县在半月时间内即赚麦子七十二万余斤。修武组织了妇女纺织，并经过生产自救建立少数合作社。这样在实际体验中，使群众认识了，只有共产党才是真正为人民，对给人民造成严重灾难的国民党反动派表示了强烈的仇恨，阶级觉悟迅速提高。加以今年生产运动中，连续发生了敌伪破坏生产事件。如开春时×县被敌伪破坏水渠、农具。夏收时，汤阴县四、五、一区之菜园、大幸；安阳伦掌、漳协曹沟、后屯等村，均发生烧麦与抢麦子事件，据五分司令部统计夏收中群众损失达八百余亩。这些罪恶活动中，激动了群众肃匪积极性，使群众认识到，敌伪散匪哪天不能彻底肃清，哪天不能安心生产，因此在保卫生产与保卫社会治安口号下，各村成立了生产治安委员会、保麦队，组织保田巡逻制，群众自觉的保卫了自己生产。
    三、必须依靠群众肃匪，实行必要的社会改革，初步发动群众，没有这一着动员群众进行肃匪生产是困难的，我们将找不到可靠依托，因此在豫北新区就是一面肃匪生产，一面结合群众的要求曾实行了许多必要的社会改革，如公平负担、减租、分配公地庙产给基本群众。这一环对于发动群众肃匪与建立民主政权，发挥了很大作用。
    四、建立与健全经常的治安组织与各种制度，才能保证与巩固肃匪工作的胜利成果。经验证明，肃匪工作虽有成绩，如果忽视经常的治安保卫工作，必然造成坏分子投机活动。今年各地成立的生产治安委员会（有些是生产委员会下有治安股），设有专人负责，定出必要的会议制度（注意不要浪费民力），定期研究治安工作，建立了户籍制度，对个别坏分子进行必要处理，对已登记人员经常注意教育，将他们组织到生产中，对其中一些人的困难已给予必要与可能的解决。这一切对于敌伪人员改造教育，将起很大作用。只有经常治安的保卫工作，社会秩序安定，群众安心生产才有保证。
