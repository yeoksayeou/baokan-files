　　A Record of the Summer Study Session for Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff
    Ji Qing
    "The change happened so fast that many people felt surprised and felt the need to relearn." This led teachers and staff of primary and secondary schools in Beiping, whether they were old gentlemen around fifty or sixty years old, young teachers in their twenties or thirties, men or women, to gather together from all corners to study in the hot summer or on stormy days, listening to major reports and holding heated discussions. This eagerness to pursue new ideas and new things made the five or six thousand teachers forget their fatigue, forget the usual vacation, and unite together to spend the first valuable and meaningful summer in their lives.
    Because this study was based on complete voluntarism, the students in each branch, except for special circumstances, were unwilling to be absent or late, even on rainy days. For example, Mr. Bai Wenshou of the Si Cun branch, who is sixty-four years old this year, lives three or four miles away from the school, and he has never been late, even in heavy rain. Mr. Ma Ronghou of the Third District Central Branch, who lives in the southern part of the city and suffers from hemorrhoids, still insisted on coming to study. Later, when he really couldn't walk, he had to stay at home, and he asked his colleagues to send him study notes every day to study on his own. So many model examples moved everyone and inspired everyone's learning. They extended or found other times to discuss unfinished topics, came early in the morning, worked until twelve o'clock to copy wall newspapers, consulted books to answer questions raised on the platform, and went to bed very late for mutual aid group learning.
    What everyone was most interested in was listening to the major reports. They listened to a total of fifteen reports, the content of which revolved around the history of social development. At this time, when you walked past the awning in the Si Cun Middle School playground, you could see every student sitting on their own benches, listening attentively. When the speaker got to an exciting point, everyone laughed lightly. Most people took notes carefully. When it rained, the periphery of the awning was surrounded by a circle of various umbrellas, and the people sitting under the umbrellas kept writing. Many students from the Girls' High School branch had three notebooks: one for recording the conference, one for recording group discussions, and another for their own reading notes.
    A month passed quickly. Everyone recalled that they had gained a lot. A month ago, everyone felt that manual laborers were dirty, and they were embarrassed to go to the street to buy vegetables or carry water for fear of being seen by others. If they walked or sat with workers, they felt they would lose their status. However, during this month, they realized that the world was created by workers, and even people themselves were created by labor. They realized that despising labor was completely a bourgeois ideology and violated the truth. After that, everyone's feelings began to change, and they no longer felt restrained when buying vegetables or carrying water. One teacher, after a rain, saw water accumulating in front of the door, and took up an iron hoe to repair the road. The neighbor asked in surprise, "Why is Mr. × also repairing the road?" After he explained to everyone, others joined him in repairing the road. Li Peiyuan of the Girls' High School branch had been an apprentice in Northeast China when he was young. He had never told anyone about it for more than ten years. Now that he said it, he felt particularly happy.
    Everyone initially realized that there must be class struggle in a class society, and the idea of transcending class collapsed. In the past, many people believed that although they were not proletarian, they were not affected by the exploiting class and were beyond class. However, after studying, they found that their views on many issues were influenced by the exploiting class. The misunderstandings of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union were examples. Therefore, Fan Linchang of the Girls' No. 1 Middle School branch said: "We must jump out of the swamp of dirt and become a traitor to our original class. We must turn our thoughts and feelings into the thoughts and feelings of the workers, and stand with the proletariat and move towards one goal." Li Gengyin, a female teacher from the People's School branch and of landlord origin, used to think that the landlords' land supported many poor people, and that it was wrong to fight the landlords. But after studying, she said: "Although I have so much land, I didn't plant any of it myself. It was all exchanged for the blood and sweat of the peasants, and the peasants ate cornbread while we ate good food. Only then did I realize that so much land in the past was obtained through exploitation."
    This study enabled everyone to initially master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, especially during the final summary, everyone was able to break through face-saving and conduct criticism.
    Although the study has ended, everyone felt that the time was too short. Some groups hoped that the same people would continue to study in their spare time, and some hoped that they could study as well as this when they returned to their posts in the future.

　　记中小学教职员暑期学习会
    纪青
    “事变是发展得这样快，以至使很多人感到突然，感到要重新学习。”，这使得北平市中小学校的教职员们，不论是五六十岁上下的老先生，二三十岁的年青教师，男的、女的，都冒着炎热的暑天，或是在暴风雨的日子，从各个角落汇拢来在一起学习，听大报告，开热烈的讨论会。这种迫切追求新思想与新事物的心，使五六千位教师们忘了疲劳，忘了往年照例的假期，团结在一起，渡过有生以来第一个有价值、有意义的暑期。
    由于这次学习是基于完全的自愿，各分会的学员除了特殊的事情外，即使在雨天，也都不肯缺席与迟到。象四存分会的白文寿老先生，今年六十四岁了，他家离学校三四里远，即使在雨大，也没有迟到过一次。三区中心分会马荣厚老先生，家住在南城，又生痔疮，仍然坚持来学习，后来实在不能走路了，只好在家里，他要求同人每天给他送学习记录自己学习。许许多多的模范例子，使大家很感动，激励着大家的学习。他们为了讨论未完，延长或另找时间讨论，早晨提前来，为了抄写壁报，工作到十二点，为了解答点将台上提出的问题，参考书籍，为了互助组的学习，也很晚才睡。
    大家最感兴趣的是听大报告，他们一共听了十五次报告，内容都是围绕着社会发展史来讲的。这时，当你走过四存中学操场席棚旁边，可以看到坐在自备板凳上的每个学员都在聚精会神地听讲，讲到兴奋的地方，大家轻快地笑着。大多数的人都认真地做笔记，下雨时席棚的周围围着一圈各色各样的雨伞，坐在雨伞下的人也在不停的写着。女附中分会许多学员都有三本笔记：一本是大会的记录，一本是小组讨论记录，另一本是自己的读书笔记。
    一个月匆匆过去，每个人回忆起来，都觉得自己的收获不少，一月以前大家都还是见了劳动的人觉得脏，自己上街买菜、担水，怕别人看见难为情，假使和工友在一起走路，或是坐在一起，那可是失了自己的身份。但是在一个月当中，认识了世界是劳动者创造的，连人本身也是劳动创造的，认识到轻视劳动完全是剥削阶级意识，是违背真理的。这以后，大家的感情开始变了，买起菜来、挑起水来不再感拘束了。有一位教员，在下雨以后，看到门前积水，自己拿起铁镢修路，邻家惊异地问：“为会么×先生也修路呢？”他向大家解释后，别的人也同他一齐修路了。女附中分会李培元幼时曾在东北当学徒，十来年一向都未和任何人说过，如今说了出来，感到特别愉快。
    大家初步认识到在阶级社会里必然有阶级斗争，超阶级思想垮了台。过去许多人认为自己虽不是无产阶级，但也并没有受到剥削阶级的影响，超然于阶级之外。然自学习之后，发现自己对好些问题的看法都是受了剥削阶级的影响，象对共产党、对苏联的误解就是例子。因此，女一中分会樊林昌说：“我们要跳出污泥的陷阱，做原阶级的一个叛徒，我们必须把自己的思想和感情变成劳动者的思想和感情，和无产阶级站在一道向一个目标前进。”平民分会地主出身的女教员李庚寅，过去认为地主的地养活了多少穷人，斗争地主是不应该的。但是学习以后她说：“虽然那么多地，自己并没有种一点，都是农民血汗换来的，而农民吃的是窝头，我们吃好的，我才知道过去那么多地是剥削来的。”
    这次学习使大家初步掌握了批评与自我批评的武器，特别是在最后总结的时候，大家都能打破面子进行批评。
    学习虽然终了，但大家都感到时间太短了，有的小组希望原来这些人还在课余继续学习，有的希望将来回到工作岗位上仍能学习得象这样好。
