　　Resolute Chinese Student Body
  　Will Inflict Crushing Blow on U.S. Imperialist Aggression
    Normal University Student Union Denounces White Paper
    [This Newspaper Despatch] The Student Union of National Peiping Normal University issued a statement on the 24th denouncing the U.S. imperialist White Paper. The original text is as follows:
    The White Paper on "United States Relations with China," released by the U.S. State Department on the fifth of this month, is a desperate confession by U.S. imperialists after their aid to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government, in defiance of the will of the American people and disregarding the interests of the Chinese people, to undermine China's territorial unity and integrity, met with failure in the face of the strong democratic forces of the entire Chinese people and the democratic forces of the world. Even from the summary of the White Paper, it is very clear that there is not a single fact in which U.S. imperialism does not commit crimes of hostility and aggression against the interests of the Chinese people. Such acts of aggression against China have aroused the indignation of the Chinese people, the condemnation of the American people, and the resentment of the people of the world; it is an inevitable outcome and a painful blow that U.S. imperialism deserves for its endless launching of aggression in its vain attempt to conquer the world. This self-incriminating confession makes us clearly realize that any imperialism, as long as it violates the interests of the people of the world, will suffer the same fate. However, the shameless and scheming U.S. imperialism is "reluctant to give up until all hope is lost." Therefore, it has tried its best to slander the Sino-Soviet Friendly Alliance Treaty, fabricate wild remarks, and sow discord in the deep friendship between the fraternal countries of China and the Soviet Union; it uses all kinds of distortions of facts in an attempt to diminish the prestige of the Chinese Communist Party among the people; even more shameful is its vain attempt, after the complete failure of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, to use various despicable and shameless methods to try to use so-called "democratic individualists" to organize anti-communist factions and divide and shake the people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat. We solemnly warn U.S. imperialism that in the face of the resolute Chinese student body, in the face of the Chinese people and the world's peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, any absurd, vicious, slanderous, and shameless wild words and ambitions will inevitably encounter the solemn resistance and crushing blows of the people of the world. We have never been fooled in the past, and we will not be fooled in the future. We firmly believe that only under the banner of the Chinese Communist Party, under the leadership of the Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao, and standing firmly in the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, can we smash any imperialist conspiracies and completely liberate all of China and all of mankind.

　　坚强的中国学生队伍
  　必予美帝侵略以痛击
    师大学生会斥白皮书
    【本报讯】国立北平师范大学学生会于二十四日发表文告，斥责美帝白皮书。原文如下：
    美国国务院本月五日发表的名为“中美关系”的白皮书，是美帝国主义者违背美国人民意旨，不顾中国人民利益，破坏中国领土统一与完整，援助蒋匪政府在坚强的全中国人民民主力量和全世界民主力量面前遭到失败后无可奈何的供状。单从白皮书的摘要中，就很明确的看出美帝没有一件事实不是仇视与侵略中国人民利益的罪行。这种侵华事实，引起中国人民愤慨，美国人民谴责，全世界人民愤恨，是一种必然的结局；也是美国帝国主义者妄想征服世界无止境的发动侵略所应得的痛击。这篇不打自招的供状，使我们清晰的认识到：不论任何帝国主义，只要违背全世界人民利益，定会遭到同样的结局。然而，无耻阴谋的美帝国主义，是“不到黄河心不死”的，所以他竭力诽谤中苏友好同盟条约，捏造狂言，挑拨离间中苏兄弟国家的深厚友谊；用一切歪曲事实，企图降低中国共产党在人民中的威信；更可耻的是妄想在蒋匪反动集团完全失败后，利用各种卑鄙无耻方式，妄图利用所谓的“民主个人主义”者，组织反共派别，分化动摇以无产阶级为领导的人民民主专政政权。我们严正的警告美帝国主义，在坚强的中国学生队伍面前，在中国人民和以苏联为首的全世界和平民主阵营面前，任何荒谬、恶毒、污蔑、无耻的狂语和野心，必将遭到全世界人民的严肃的抵抗和痛击。我们过去未曾上过当，今后更不会上当，我们坚信只有在中国共产党旗帜下，中国人民领袖毛主席领导下，坚强的站在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营里，才能粉碎帝国主义的任何阴谋诡计，彻底解放全中国，解放全人类。
