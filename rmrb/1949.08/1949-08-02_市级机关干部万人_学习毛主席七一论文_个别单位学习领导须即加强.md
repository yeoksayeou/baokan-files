    Ten Thousand Municipal Cadres
    Study Chairman Mao's July 1st Article
    Leadership of Study in Individual Units Must Be Immediately Strengthened
    [By Our Own Correspondent] Since the Propaganda Department of the CCP Beiping Municipal Committee issued the study notice on July 11, cadres from various units at the Beiping municipal level have been swept into a high tide of studying Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." Various units at the municipal level, including the various bureaus and departments under the Beiping Municipal People's Government, the People's Court, trading companies, the People's Bank, cooperatives, and various departments under the Municipal Party Committee and the Military Control Commission, totaling forty-six units (excluding district offices and public security sub-bureaus), have strengthened, consolidated, or established study committee organizations. Up to now, 701 study groups have been formed throughout the city, with more than 9,900 cadres on the job participating in study organizations. Most units have carefully studied the "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" document. Some units have given major reports, some have held group discussions, and some are making study summaries. Among them, the Public Security Bureau and the Civil Affairs Bureau have been able to persist in studying for two hours every day, the leadership of the study is tightly grasped, and discussions are heated. From July 16 to July 31, the Civil Affairs Bureau divided the study time into three stages: First stage: individual study, combined with casual talks in mutual aid groups. During this time, carefully read the document, grasp the spirit of the document, raise questions, and submit them to the Study Committee for collection and research, compile discussion questions, and distribute them to various groups for discussion. The time is three days. Second stage: discussion and debate of key issues. Third stage: hold a general discussion meeting for the whole bureau, and each group selects representatives to be the main speakers at the meeting. Finally, each group checks the study attitude, summarizes the study experience, and combines personal thoughts and understanding to write study notes. The Military Control Commission has also separated into groups for study and established an examination and testing system. All units are doing according to the formulated plan. However, the responsible comrades of individual units still neglect the importance of study, use the excuse of being busy with work, do not take the lead, and do not recognize the importance of study. This point should be corrected.

    市级机关干部万人
    学习毛主席七一论文
    个别单位学习领导须即加强
    【本报讯】北平市一级各机关的干部已卷入学习毛主席“论人民民主专政”的热潮。自中共北平市委会宣传部于七月十一日发出学习通知后，市一级各单位：平市人民政府所属各局、处和人民法院、贸易公司、人民银行、合作社等，市委所属各部门及军管会等四十六个单位（不包括各区公所、公安分局），即加强、巩固或成立学习委员会组织，到现在全市已编成七百零一个学习小组，在职干部有九千九百余人参加了学习组织。各单位多已精读了“论人民民主专政”文件，有的单位做了大报告，有的单位举行小组座谈，有的正在做学习总结。其中公安局、民政局每天都能坚持两小时学习，学习领导上抓得紧，讨论热烈。民政局自七月十六日到三十一日，将学习时间划分为三个阶段：第一阶段：个人学习，结合互助小组漫谈，在这段时间精读文件，领会文件精神，提出问题，交学委会汇集研究，编印讨论问题，分发各组进行讨论，时间为三天；第二阶段：讨论时争辩主要问题；第三阶段，举行全局讨论大会，各组推选代表，在会上为主要发言人。最后各组检查学习态度，总结学习经验，并结合个人思想、认识，写学习笔记。军管会也已分开组学习，并建立考试测验制度，各单位都根据拟定的计划去做。但有个别单位负责同志仍忽视学习的重要，借口工作忙，不起带头作用，没有认识学习的重要，这点是应当纠正的。
