[By Our Newspaper] Taiyuan News: The first phase of Taiyuan's construction plan is nearing completion. The city, which suffered severe damage from the dying Yan Xishan bandits, has gradually recovered from the wounds of war after more than three months of repair work since liberation. After liberation, the People's Government led workers and citizens to clear streets, extinguish fires, and quickly restore water and electricity. In June, the Taiyuan City Construction Work Conference was held, determining that construction would be carried out in two phases, and proposing three main tasks: 1. Flood prevention and drainage issues related to the safety of citizens' lives and the demolition of dangerous buildings. 2. Cleaning and tidying up the city appearance, repairing roads, installing street lights, and removing ash and slag. 3. Repairing Wenying Lake for citizens to relax after work. At the same time, citizens were widely mobilized to repair public and private houses damaged by the Yan Xishan bandits. The first phase of the construction plan began in early June, and by the 20th, the work of raising and repairing the rivers outside the city was completed first; in early July, 4,700 meters of drainage ditches in the city were excavated and repaired; more than 60,000 cartloads of garbage and ash left by the Yan Xishan bandits were cleared from the streets and various institutions; water pumps and broken water pipes were repaired, increasing the daily water supply from 3,000 tons in early May to more than 4,700 tons by the end of July, exceeding the highest daily water supply of 1,100 tons during the Yan Xishan's rule; more than 560 street lights were installed; most of the ten bunkers obstructing traffic in the city have been demolished; and the Wenying Lake construction project has also been largely completed. On July 15th, the repair of streets and roads began, and the Military Control Commission allocated 80,000 bags of captured cement for the repair of roads. In the construction work, more than a thousand soldiers guarding Taiyuan participated in the demolition of bunkers and other work, working together with the citizens to build a new Taiyuan city.
