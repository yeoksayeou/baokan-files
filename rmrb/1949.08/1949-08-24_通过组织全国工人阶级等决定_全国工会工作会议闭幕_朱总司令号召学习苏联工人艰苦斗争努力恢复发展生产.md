Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd: The National Trade Union Work Conference convened in Beiping by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which opened on July 23rd and lasted for 25 days, concluded on the 16th of this month. This conference was the first important meeting to discuss trade union work since the Sixth National Labor Congress in August of last year. Its purpose was to adapt to the needs of the developing revolutionary situation and to discuss how to mobilize, organize, and rely on the working class in order to carry out great economic construction and political power construction work throughout the country.

During the 25-day session, there were speeches by Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, a political report by Vice-Chairman Zhou, a report on trade union organization issues by Li Lisan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, a report on financial and economic issues by Bo Yibo, Secretary of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, a report on labor-capital relations issues by Liu Zijiu, Minister of the Propaganda and Education Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, a report by Liu Ningyi, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on attending the Second World Federation of Trade Unions Congress, a report on youth league issues by Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, a report on women workers issues by Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and a report on wage issues by Li Lisan. These reports were all followed by enthusiastic discussions by the representatives.

The main items discussed at the meeting were: (1) Trade union organization issues: The meeting determined to broadly develop trade union organizations, oppose closed-doorism, establish democratic life within trade unions, implement a democratic election system for trade union leading organs, and launch a mass movement to run trade unions, correcting the current phenomena of appointment system and monopolization prevalent in trade union work in various regions. The meeting also clearly stipulated the basic principle of organizing trade unions by industry, while also determining that, under the current special circumstances in China, the important role of local trade unions, especially urban general trade unions, should be a major component of the leadership system of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. The meeting stipulated the principles governing the relationship between industrial trade unions and local trade unions. During the discussion of this issue at the plenary session, Zhu Xuefan, Director of the China Labor Association and the current Second Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, solemnly declared: "The China Labor Association is willing to merge with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. The comrades of the Labor Association are sincerely willing to unite with all the comrades of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and to jointly strive to the end for the liberation of the Chinese people and the victory of the Chinese working class." The meeting unanimously passed the draft "Decision on Membership Issues," the draft "Decision on the Trade Union Organization System," the draft "Decision on Trade Union Funding Issues," and the draft "Regulations on Trade Union Membership Dues," which were submitted to the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for approval and implementation. (2) On labor-capital relations issues: The meeting unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's policy of "giving consideration to both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital" must be resolutely implemented. Drawing on the experience of the Beiping State Pharmaceutical Industry in concluding labor-capital collective contracts, it pointed out that concluding labor-capital collective contracts according to industry and trade is the central link in resolving labor-capital relations issues at present. The conference unanimously passed the draft "Provisional Measures for Handling Labor-Capital Relations" and other documents, and formulated the draft "Regulations on the Organization of Labor Bureaus" and the draft "Provisional Measures for Handling Labor Dispute Procedures." In addition, regarding the issue of democratization of factory management in state-owned enterprises, the meeting unanimously approved the regulations on factory management committees passed by the North China Staff and Workers Representative Conference, believing that these regulations are suitable for all state-owned enterprises in the country. Regarding wage issues and unemployment issues, the meeting put forward preliminary solutions and opinions. Representatives from various regions also made typical reports on "Labor Insurance Work," "Production Competition Experience," "How to Lead the Production Movement," "Everyone Runs the Trade Union," and "The Beiping State Pharmaceutical Industry Concludes Labor-Capital Collective Contracts," exchanging work experience with each other.

The conference held its closing ceremony on the 16th of this month. Commander-in-Chief Zhu attended and delivered a speech. He called on "the national working class to practice thrift and frugality, learn from the hard-working revolutionary style of the Soviet working class, prepare for struggle, and build their own homes!" Commander-in-Chief Zhu emphasized: "The working class must have the far-sighted vision of enduring hardship before enjoying happiness, organize themselves, and strive to restore and develop production." In his closing remarks, Comrade Li Lisan particularly emphasized: "We must follow the instructions of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, understand the reports of Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Bo Yibo, convey the spirit of this conference and the principles of various resolutions to the broad masses of workers, so that this spirit and these principles become the actions of the masses, in order to fulfill the historical mission of the working class as the leading class of the state. After returning to their respective regions, the representatives should not only correctly convey the spirit and decisions of this conference, but also ensure the correct implementation of the various decisions of this conference."

At the closing session, Liu Ningyi proposed sending a telegram to the Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Saillant, welcoming the convocation of the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Representatives Conference in China, and requesting the World Federation of Trade Unions to provide specific instructions and assistance. This proposal was unanimously adopted.

    大会于本月十六日举行闭幕式。朱总司令亲临讲话，他号召“全国工人阶级节衣缩食，学习苏联工人阶级革命的艰苦作风，准备斗争，建立自己的家务！”朱总司令并着重指出：“工人阶级要有吃苦在前、享福在后的远大眼光，组织起来，为恢复和发展生产而努力。”李立三同志在闭幕词中，特别强调地指出：“我们要遵从毛主席和朱总司令的指示，领会周恩来同志和薄一波同志的报告，把这次会议的精神和各种决议的原则，传达到广大的工人群众中去，使这种精神和原则变成群众的行动，以完成工人阶级充当国家领导阶级的历史使命。各地代表回去以后，不但要正确地传达此次会议的精神和决定，而且要保证此次会议各项决定的正确执行。”
    在闭幕会上，刘宁一提议致电世界工联总书记赛扬，欢迎亚澳两洲职工代表会议在中国召开，请世界工联给予具体的指示和协助。这一提议当获全体一致通过。
