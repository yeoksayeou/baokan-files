　　Pinggongying Yumin Mountain Goods Depot
  　Incoming and Outgoing Goods Volume Increases Greatly
  　Nearly One Hundred Farmers from Various Regions Exchange Goods Daily
    [This newspaper's report] With the new mountain goods entering the market season, the business of the Yumin Mountain Goods Depot in Ping City is becoming more prosperous, with the volume of mountain goods received in mid-August increasing sharply compared to the beginning of the month. At the end of June, the municipal public Yumin Mountain Goods Depot dispatched three cadres to Pingbei, Pingxi, and Zhuolu's 13th district to contact local supply and marketing cooperatives, mountain goods stores, and reception stations to establish connections. As mountain goods enter their peak season in autumn, the volume of goods received is increasing daily. In the past five days, farmers from Pingbei (Huairou, Si Hai, Changping, Fengning) and Pingxi (Laishui, Wanping) have been taking advantage of their agricultural off-season to transport almonds to Ping City for sale. Approximately one hundred farmers arrive at the depot daily to sell goods, and by the 19th, the total amount of mountain goods (mainly almonds) received daily had exceeded ten thousand jin. According to statistics from the depot, in mid-August, the depot received a total of over 46,100 jin of mountain goods, an increase of nearly two times compared to the over 16,800 jin in early August. At the same time, the business of the depot's supply and marketing section is also developing accordingly. Farmers who come to Ping City to sell goods often purchase daily necessities to take back after selling their mountain goods. Therefore, the sales volume of the supply and marketing section's cloth (foreign cloth and colored native cloth) has increased. In mid-August, 550 bolts of various colored native cloths were sold, with a total value of over 3.1 million yuan.
    [Another News Item] In order to meet the needs of farmers, the depot has specially purchased a large quantity of second-hand clothing from Tianjin for sale in Ping City, including quilts, sheets, and both unlined, lined and cotton-padded clothing.

    【本报讯】新山货上市季节，平市裕民山货栈业务转趋欣荣，八月份中旬收进之山货量较上旬骤增。本市公营裕民山货栈，在六月底为开辟山货来源，曾派三个干部分别至平北、平西及涿鹿十三区等地与当地供销社、山货店、招待站等单位接洽并取得联系。入秋后山货进入旺月，收货量日渐增加。近五日来，平北：怀柔、四海、昌平、丰宁，平西：涞水、宛平一带之农民纷纷利用农闲时间运输杏仁来平销售，每日到达该栈售货之农民有百人上下，至十九日每天收进山货（主要是杏仁）总量已超过万斤。据该栈统计，八月中旬该栈共收山货四万六千一百余斤，较上旬一万六千八百余斤增加近两倍。同时该栈供销科之业务亦随之开展，来平售货之农民于卖出山货后多购买日用必需品带回，因而供销科之布匹（洋布及色土布）销售数量增加，八月中旬售出各色土布五百五十匹，总值在三百一十万元以上。
    【又讯】该栈为适应农民需要，特由天津购来大批估衣在平应售，种类有被褥、单、夹、棉衣等。
