Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 28th: Budapest dispatch: The 24th was World Battle Youth Day at the World Youth and Student Festival. On this day, specially arranged for the youth of colonies and dependent countries in struggle, a grand demonstration parade was held on the streets of Budapest. The demonstration队伍 shouted slogans for peace, for youth unity, and for a better future, crying out in various languages: "Long live the great Stalin!" "Long live the heroic Communist Youth League!" Representatives of young men and women from Indonesia, Burma, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Algeria, Egypt, and South Africa, dressed in national costumes, were greeted with cheers from the crowds. Representatives from China, Greece, and Spain were particularly welcomed. The Chinese youth delegation's procession was led by an eight-person-carried portrait of Stalin, followed by embroidered portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and more than ten red flags. Along the way, they sang songs such as "We are Democratic Youth" and "Unity is Strength."

In the evening, a bonfire party was held on a hillside on the right bank of the Danube (where the memorial to the Soviet heroes who sacrificed their lives for the liberation of Hungary stands). Representatives from various countries sang the song of the World Federation of Democratic Youth in various languages. Nguyen Chi-Gia, chairman of the World Youth Colonial Department, delivered the opening speech, saying that the victory of all the fighting countries in the world proves that with the united efforts of the world's youth, the democratic forces of the world are growing stronger and stronger, and the death of imperialism is not far away. Then, the conference presented flowers to the youth representatives of Greece, Spain, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaya, and every fighting country in Africa and Latin America. China was listed as a victorious country. This was followed by two-minute speeches by representatives from various countries. The Soviet representative, Mamotova, a girl from Kyrgyzstan, said: "We are confident that the day will soon come when the youth of colonial and semi-colonial countries will gain freedom and a happy life." Xiao Hua, deputy head of the Chinese delegation, said: "The flames of the people's struggle for freedom have spread all over the world. The struggle of the colonial people is not isolated. The powerful peace camp headed by the Soviet Union is extending a helping hand to you, and the 475 million Chinese people will also vigorously support you." Finally, the evening once again saw a moving scene of international friendship. After denouncing the US government's crimes of foreign aggression and oppression of black people, the US representative donated travel expenses to the representative of Puerto Rico on the spot. The African representative donated medicines to the Greek representative on the spot. The Dutch representative and the Indonesian representative warmly embraced, and the Indian representative presented flowers to the World Federation of Youth and sent the portrait of Lei Di, a young hero who sacrificed his life for Indian independence, to the world youth representatives. Boisson, chairman of the World Federation of Youth, finally said: "The struggle of the youth who are exploited by imperialism is also our struggle. They are fighting for the liberation of the people of all countries from the tyranny of imperialism. Victory will be ours, because the truth is on our side."
