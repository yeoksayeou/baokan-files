　　【Taiyuan Dispatch】The 160-odd workers of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau's bridge engineering team, after more than a month of hard work, have successfully completed the bridge project on the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway Line. This project began in early May and lasted 57 days, erecting 56 spans of steel beams (with a total bridge length of over 800 meters), converting 22 temporary line bridges into main line bridges, dismantling two 10-meter steel beams, and carrying out emergency repairs on Bridges 48 and 157. According to the original plan, the entire project required 15,700 workdays, but only 12,500 workdays were actually used, saving 32,000 jin of millet.
