    Returning to the Xiang-Gan-Su Soviet Area
    Su Ce
    On July 11th, after we liberated Xiajiang City on the west bank of the Gan River, we passed through villages that had been devastated by enemy burning, killing, and looting, and pursued the fleeing bandit troops southwest. The unit traveled more than 30 li and entered a small village surrounded by jungle. Everyone immediately saw the blurred slogan "Long Live the Success of the World Revolution" on the wall, signed "Red Army Seventh Army Corps." The soldiers jumped up with joy... It turned out that we had returned to the old home of the "Xiang-Gan-Su Soviet Area" of twenty years ago.
    This village is called Baidu. Many villagers, hearing that the old Red Army had returned, rushed out and crowded around the unit, excitedly asking about the news of their husbands, sons, and relatives who had joined the Red Army. An old woman, Li Ganying, fifty-two years old, said: "After the Red Army left twenty years ago, the White Army and reactionaries came back to oppress us, but we all knew that the Red Army would grow stronger day by day, and they would never forget us, they would always return. We have been waiting for twenty years, waiting until we are old! Now, we have finally waited for you back!"
    These old Soviet area people, utterly loyal to the revolution, saw their loved ones return and poured out their suffering and the disasters that the reactionaries had inflicted on them during these twenty years. A seventy-five-year-old woman told us that after the Red Army left, the reactionaries took back the land that had been distributed, killed the land distribution committee members, hung up and beat the comrades, and burned women's heads with fire. The old woman Li Ganying said sadly that her thirteen-year-old child, who had joined the Young Pioneers at the time, was tied up by the reactionaries, hung by his thumbs, and brutally beaten. When he was bought out with money from the whole village and recovered from his injuries, he rushed to join the Red Army. She herself was beaten half to death by twenty-four White soldiers with bamboo poles and was imprisoned for forty-five days. The villagers all complained that the reactionaries forced them to return two dou for every dou they had been allocated, and if they didn't pay it off this year, the interest would increase next year. The old man Luo Gaosheng sold his house, pigs, and cattle, but still couldn't pay off the debt. One old man had been paying for twenty years and still hadn't finished.
    When talking about the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, everyone became excited. The old woman Li Ganying said happily, "In July of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China [1927], Chairman Mao gave us a speech in Lingkou Village, a few miles from here, and thousands of us went to listen." At this time, a comrade took out a picture of Chairman Mao from his notebook. She snatched it, looked at it carefully, and then held it up high with both hands, saying loudly, "It's him! It's him!" Her eyes were wet.
    The villagers were extremely enthusiastic about the return of the Red Army's children, helping to boil water and cook food. One old woman automatically boiled seven or eight pots of water, and some took out rice, salt, and oil to cook for the soldiers. When the unit paid, they firmly refused, saying, "Why give money for our own people's food?"

    回到湘赣苏区
    苏策
    七月十一日，我们解放了赣江西岸的峡江城后，就穿过刚被敌人烧杀劫掠而破坏得非常凄惨的村庄，向西南追击溃逃的匪军。部队走了三十多里，进入一个丛林环抱的小村，大家一眼就看到墙上模糊的留着“世界革命成功万岁”的标语，署名是“红军第七军团”；战士们都高兴的跳起来……。原来已经回到二十年前“湘赣苏区”的老家来了。
    这个村子叫白渡，许多老乡听说过去的老红军回来了，都跑出来拥挤在部队的周围，激动地询问着参加红军的自己的丈夫、儿子和亲属的消息。一个五十二岁的老婆婆李甘英说：“二十年前红军走了之后，白军和反动派又回来压迫我们，可是我们都知道红军一定会一天天扩大，总忘不了我们，总要回来的。我们整整盼了二十年，盼得我们都老了！现在，终于把你们盼回来了！”
    这些对革命忠心耿耿的老苏区人民看见自己的亲人回来，都尽情地控诉着这二十年中反动派加给他们的痛苦和灾害。一位七十五岁的老婆婆告诉我们说：红军走后，反动派又把分了的田抢回去，把分田委员杀了，把同志们吊起来打，把女人的头在火上烧。那个李甘英老婆婆伤心地说：她十三岁的孩子当时参加了少年先锋队，被反动派捆着大姆指头吊着毒打。当他被全村出钱卖出来，养好伤后，他就赶去参加红军了。她自己被二十四个白军用竹杆子打得死去活来，又被关了四十五天。老乡们都纷纷诉说：反动派逼迫分了一斗的要还二斗，今年还不清，明年就变本加利。罗高升老头子把房子、猪、牛都卖去，仍还不清债务。有一个老头子整整还了二十年还没有还清。
    在谈到共产党和毛主席的时候，大家都兴奋起来，李甘英老婆婆兴高采烈地说：“民国十六年七月，毛主席就在离这几里的岭口村给我们讲过话，我们几千人都去听过。”这时一位同志把本子上毛主席的像片拿出来。她一把抢过去详细地看了看，就双手高高地举起来，大声地说着：“就是他！就是他呵！”她的眼睛湿润了。
    老乡们对红军子弟的归来，都热情无比地帮助烧水作饭，一个老婆婆自动烧了七八锅水，有的拿出米、盐、油给战士们煮饭。当部队付钱时，他们坚决拒绝说：“自己人吃了还给什么钱。”
