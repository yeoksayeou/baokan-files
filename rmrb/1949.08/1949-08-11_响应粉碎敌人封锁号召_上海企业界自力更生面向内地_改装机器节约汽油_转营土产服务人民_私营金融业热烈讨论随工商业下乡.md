    Responding to the Call to Crush the Enemy's Blockade
   Shanghai's Business Community Relies on Its Own Efforts and Faces the Mainland
    Modifying Machines to Save Gasoline
    Switching to Native Products to Serve the People
    Private Financial Industry Enthusiastically Discussing Going to the Countryside with Industry and Commerce
    [Report from this newspaper] The people of all circles in Shanghai are actively responding to the call of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to crush the enemy's blockade and have begun to take action. Public and private transportation institutions in Shanghai are modifying large numbers of charcoal and gas vehicles to save gasoline. The Pudong Local Construction Company and others have already modified more than fifty vehicles. In order to smash the blockade and rely on their own efforts, Shanghai's woolen textile factories, in addition to some factories already purchasing domestic wool from Jiaxing, Huzhou and other places, the private Zhanghua and Anle factories have begun to partially change their production direction. Zhanghua Factory is mixing waste wool into raw wool to spin into wool yarn. Anle Factory is taking it a step further, using waste wool and cotton to make wool-cotton blended yarn, and is now preparing to weave this blended yarn into cotton-wool fabrics, which can be used as raw materials for uniforms. In this way, on the one hand, raw wool is saved, and on the other hand, the sales of the products are more suitable for the needs of the masses. According to a rough estimate by Wang Deming, director of Anle Factory, the cost and selling price of this wool-cotton fabric is only one-sixth of that of fine woolen cloth. The private Mingxing Perfume Factory decided to change its business due to poor sales. At present, 40% of its capital and manpower have been used for producing soap.
    Under the leadership of the industry association, twenty enamel factories are working hard to reduce their dependence on foreign countries for the raw materials they need. On the one hand, they are actively trying to switch to domestic materials, and on the other hand, they have launched raw material exchanges within the industry to share what they have and what they lack. At the same time, in terms of reducing costs, they have decided to focus on being practical and realistic, and not pursue false beauty in order to reduce unnecessary waste of raw materials and cooperate with the government's call for conservation. The industry also hopes that the Anshan Iron Mine can supply them with the most important raw material, iron sheet, in the short term. In order to overcome sluggish sales and strive for mass-market finished products, the Xin Guang Standard Underwear Dyeing and Weaving Factory has decided to shift its business to the mainland and change to weaving printed cloth, bleached cloth, and shilin cloth. Also, because underwear used to be mostly exported to Southeast Asia, it will now increase the production of center-seam underwear and produce large quantities of workers' and peasants' clothing in order to develop sales in the mainland. Some state-owned enterprises have begun to streamline their organizations and organize surplus personnel to return to their hometowns to engage in production. Because most of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's ships were robbed by the fleeing bandit Chiang Kai-shek's army, and the enemy blockaded the ports, the company's business could not be fully developed, resulting in large government subsidies. It has now streamlined its past huge bureaucratic organization according to actual needs. For the surplus personnel, the leadership will refer to individual opinions and help them to develop production in the rural areas of the mainland, develop inland river transportation in the areas of the Grand Canal and the Huai River, or participate in learning. Ten workers from the China Oil Transportation Company, which is under the jurisdiction of the shipping department, took the lead in returning to their hometowns to engage in production. The China Produce Insurance Company, the Shanghai office of the China Vegetable Oil Factory, and other units have also signed up to return to their hometowns to engage in production. Private financial institutions have been enthusiastically discussing the issue of the financial industry going to the countryside in the past few days. When Sun Shuren, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Banking Association, expressed his personal opinion on this issue, he first pointed out that in the past, under the dual oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, Shanghai's industry and commerce, although seemingly prosperous on the surface, were actually a deformed phenomenon, which not only could not correctly adapt to the requirements of building a new China, but also had major problems in seeking its own development. Now that imperialism and its running dogs have blockaded Shanghai, it is actually giving Shanghai's industry and commerce the best opportunity to rely on their own efforts. He believes that the instruction that industry and commerce should be decentralized to the mainland is very correct. As for the financial industry, it should also follow industry and commerce to the countryside. Mr. Sun also particularly emphasized that the private financial industry may encounter some difficulties at the beginning of going to the countryside, but this is necessary and can be overcome.

    响应粉碎敌人封锁号召
   上海企业界自力更生面向内地
    改装机器节约汽油
    转营土产服务人民
    私营金融业热烈讨论随工商业下乡
    【本报讯】上海各界人民积极响应中共市委会粉碎敌人封锁的号召，已开始行动起来。沪市公私营运输机构，为节约汽油，大量改装木炭瓦斯汽车，浦东地方建设公司等，已改装五十余部。沪市毛纺织厂为了粉碎封锁，自力更生，除部分厂家已向嘉兴、湖州等地采购国产羊毛外，私营章华和安乐两厂，已开始部分的改变了生产方向。章华厂在原料羊毛中掺合废毛纺成毛纱。安乐厂更进一步，利用废毛和棉花做成毛棉混纺，现正准备将这种混纱织成棉毛织物，可做制服原料。如此，一方面节省了原料羊毛，一方面产品的销路也比较适合群众需要。据安乐厂厂长王德明的粗略估计，这种毛棉织物的成本和售价只有细呢的六分之一。私营明星香水厂则因销路不好，决定转业。目前资金及人力已有百分之四十用于生产肥皂。
    二十家搪瓷工厂，在同业公会领导下，正努力减除本身所需原料的对外依赖性。一方面积极设法改用国产材料，另一方面展开了同业中的原料交换，使有无相通，同时在减低成本一点上，他们决定以实事求是为主，不求虚伪美观以便减低不必需的原料浪费，配合政府的节约号召。该业并希望鞍山铁矿，在短期内能供应他们原料中最主要的铁皮。新光标准内衣染织整理厂，为了克服销路呆滞和力求成品大众化，决定经营业务转向内地，改织印花布、漂白布、士林布等。又因内衣以前多外销南洋，现在为了开展内地销路，将加制中线内衣，并大量添制工农服装。某些国营企业单位则已开始精简机构，组织编余人员还乡生产。招商局因船舶大部被逃溃的蒋匪军劫走，再加敌人封锁海口，业务未能全面开展，致政府亏贴很大，现已将过去庞大的官僚机构根据实际需要实行精简。对编余人员，领导上将参考个人意见，分别帮助他们到内地农村发展生产，到运河淮河一带去开发内河航运，或参加学习。航运处所属中国油输公司有十名工友自动带头还乡生产。中国产物保险公司，中国植物油厂上海办事处等单位，亦均有人报名还乡生产。一般私营金融机构，这几天正热烈展开金融业下乡问题的讨论。本市银行公会秘书长孙叔仁对此问题发表个人意见时，他首先指出，过去本市工商业，在帝国主义及国民党反动派的双重压迫下，表面上虽然好象很繁荣，其实只是一种畸形现象，不但不能够正确地适应建设新中国的要求，且是但求自己的发展也大有问题。现在，帝国主义和他的走狗既然对上海进行了封锁，实在是给予上海工商业自力更生一个最好机会。他认为工商业应该分散到内地去的指示，是非常正确的。至于金融业也应该跟随工商业下乡。孙先生并特别强调：私营金融业下乡开始时，也许会碰到一些困难，不过这是必须而且可能克服的。
