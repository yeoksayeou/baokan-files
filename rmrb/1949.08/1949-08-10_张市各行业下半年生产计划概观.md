The Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Government, starting with assisting various industries in formulating their production plans for the second half of the year, is addressing the supply and sales issues currently existing in the iron casting, flour milling, machine manufacturing, egg processing, oil pressing, and fur industries. It also aims to further increase production and improve technology.

	The Yuanxing Oil Mill, in the oil pressing industry, experienced poor business in April and May, even incurring losses. This was mainly due to higher costs compared to hand-operated oil pressing in northern Hebei, making it unable to compete, as well as significant fluctuations in oil and grain prices. With the assistance of the government, it has now switched to pressing pure sesame oil and rapeseed oil, and sales are no longer a problem. Tianjin Tongfu Paint Factory alone requires 100,000 catties per month and has signed a contract. In terms of oil quality, laboratory tests show a purity of 94.7 degrees, not far from the export standard. There are plans to expand, relocate the factory, install long-unused clear oil pressing machines, and establish an additional pressing division. This could double production and improve oil quality, striving for exports.

	Since its official opening on June 18th, the egg processing factory has been strongly supported by the North China Foreign Trade Company in all aspects, and everything has been going smoothly. All finished products are delivered to the company for export. Currently, it processes 130,000 eggs daily, producing over 3,000 pounds of egg white powder. Due to Zhangjiakou's cooler climate, the quality of the finished products is higher than that of egg processing factories in other regions, meeting export specifications. Regarding raw material supply, 14 specialized egg collection branches have been established in various parts of Hebei Province, averaging an input of 150,000 eggs per day. Based on the current machine production efficiency, it can process 300,000 eggs per day. However, due to the small factory site and limited drying rooms, production cannot be increased. The factory has now purchased a vacant site and plans to build 24 rooms and add 12 drying rooms. Construction is expected to be completed in early September, which could double production. It also plans to establish branches eastward along the Ping绥 Railway line to ensure a worry-free supply of raw materials.

	The iron casting industry's products are directly and closely related to the production and lives of the broad masses of farmers, and business is on the rise. The city's nine factories produced a total of 249.6 tons in the first half of the year (January to July). Reversing the unfavorable production and sales season of the past May and June, products are in short supply. Yisheng Iron Factory, in order to overcome the production reduction during the rainy season and meet market supply and demand, participated in the Beijing Industrial Exhibition and visited the production process of kilns at the Beijing Dahua Pottery Company. Based on the specific situation of iron casting, they imitated and built a kiln, which will be completed and put into use within days. In order to carry out production in a planned manner, based on past trade routes and sales volume patterns, as well as the current degree of mass demand, the factories, with government assistance, formulated the production plans for each factory in the second half of the year. A total of 388 tons of finished products are planned for all nine factories, an increase of 56% compared to the first half of the year. 485.5 tons of iron are required. In addition to the existing stock and the 290 tons that can be collected locally, there is a shortage of 195 tons, which needs to be resolved. 246 tons of coke are needed, and there are no problems with this raw material. In terms of production ratio, pots account for approximately 65.5% of the total output, stoves 21.4%, and machine parts, etc. 13.1%.

	In the flour milling industry, manual and semi-manual mills have developed the fastest since liberation. However, due to low quality, production and sales are out of sync, finished products are piling up, affecting reproduction, and leading to reduced production in various factories. The current problem is how to improve equipment, improve quality, and strive for export sales. It is necessary to step-by-step and systematically focus on supporting the transformation from manual to machine production. This is the central link in management and guidance for a certain period. As of now, Ruifeng and Tongju have begun ordering machines to improve equipment, which will be shipped to Zhangjiakou in August and September. The government and banks have provided necessary assistance for this.

	The fur manufacturing industry is famous throughout the country for its products, which are sold in Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Northeast China. It declined before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and sales are still the main problem for the industry. The city currently has 46 factories, and the finished products they produce have been backlogged for a long time and cannot be sold. State-owned companies and banks have planned to purchase finished products and provide loans to support the industry's capital turnover and continued production. They have purchased 663 lambskin coats and 1,614 fur mattresses, totaling 13,800,000 yuan, and supplied raw materials for processing and manufacturing. According to statistics, the production volume for the first half of the year (January to June) was 3,067 pieces of various fur clothing and mattresses, using 38,752 pieces of fur. Sales of various fur clothing and mattresses were 2,130 pieces. The industry currently has 20,000 pieces of lambskin, 2,500 pieces of ＠ skin, and 1,000 pieces each of cat and fox fur in stock. The main issue for the industry is solving the sales problem. Based on the development of business conditions, the following production plan suitable for production and sales conditions is formulated: the output from July to December is 8,225 lambskin robes, 24,630 fur mattresses, and 165 cat and fox fur coats. According to the above output, 310,000 pieces of raw materials still need to be supplemented. Whether the above figures can be achieved depends on the sales situation. There are a total of 39 rough leather manufacturing factories. In the first half of the year, due to the pure leather soaking season, only 1,022 finished products (leather coats) were produced in June. The plan for the second half of the year is to produce 15,000 pieces of various sizes of leather clothing and 2,000 goat skin mattresses.

	The leather industry has a total of 51 households in the city (including 10 leather strip businesses). The output in the first half of the year was 1,102 pieces of leather. Production increased month by month, from 21 pieces in January to 188 pieces in June. However, because it is a handicraft industry, the quality is low and cannot be sold externally. Therefore, improving quality, overcoming the bad habit of cutting corners, and striving to produce inferior goods are the main keys to the development of the industry in the future. The estimated output in the second half of the year can reach 4,236 pieces, an increase of 73% compared to the first half of the year. The leather strip industry has only ten households, and business has been very good since liberation, with prosperity reaching the level of the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929). The output in the first half of the year was 899 pieces, and the estimated total output in the second half of the year will reach 1,698 pieces, an increase of 46.9% compared to the first half of the year.

    张市各行业下半年生产计划概观
    张家口人民政府从协助各行业制订下半年生产计划入手，解决铸铁、面粉、机器制造、打蛋、榨油、皮裘等行业目前在经营上所存在的供销问题，及进一步提高产量，改进技术的办法。榨油业元兴油厂四、五月份营业不好，甚至亏损，主要是成本高于察北手工业榨油，不能与之竞争，以及油粮价格跳动较大等原因。在政府派人协助下，目前已改榨纯葫麻油和菜籽油，销路已不成问题，仅天津同孚油漆厂即月需十万斤，已与之订立合同。在油的质量上，据化验精度已达九四·七度，距出口的标准油相差不远。现正计划扩大，迁移厂址，装置久已不用的清油机，并计划增设立榨一部，如此产量可提高一倍，并提高油的质量，争取出口。
    打蛋厂自六月十八日正式开工以来，华北对外贸易公司在各方面极力扶助，一切均极顺利，成品全数交公司输出。目前每日打蛋十三万颗，产飞黄蛋白三千余磅。因张市气候较凉，所产成品较各地蛋厂所产质量均高，能合出口规格。原料供给上，在察省各地共设专门收购鸡蛋的分庄十四处，每日平均输入鸡蛋十五万颗。按现在机器的生产效能，可供每日打蛋三十万颗之用。但因厂址小，烤房少，无法增产。该厂现已购妥空基地一处，计划修建楼房二十四间，增辟烤房十二间，九月初可竣工，如此可较目前增产一倍，并沿平绥线向东增设分庄，原料也可保证无虑。
    铸铁业产品因与广大农民生产生活直接而密切的联系着，营业日趋上升。全市九户，上半年（一至七月）的总产量二四九·六吨，并一反过去五六月生产与销售不利季节的规律，产品供不应求。该业中义胜铁工厂为了克服雨季减产，以适应市场的供求关系，在参加北平工展与参观了北平大华窑业公司烤炉的生产过程以后，根据铸铁的具体情况仿制了烤炉一座，日内即可竣工应用。为了有计划的进行生产，根据过去贸易路线和销货额的规律及目前群众的需求程度，在现有基础上，经各厂酝酿及政府的具体协助，制订了该业各户的下半年生产计划，总计九户共产成品三八八吨，较上半年增加百分之五十六。需铁四八五·五吨，除现存及在本市零收可达二九○吨外，不足一九五吨之数，需设法解决。需焦炭二四六吨，该项原料已无问题。产量比重上锅约占总产量的百分之六五·五，火炉百分之二一·四，机器零件等百分之一三·一。
    面粉业在解放后，手工和半手工的磨坊发展最速，但因质量低，以致产销失调，成品积压，影响再生产，形成各厂的减产现象，目前问题是如何改善设备，提高质量，争取外销，必需有步骤有计划的以重点扶植为基础，变手工为机器生产，是在一定时期内在管理和指导上的中心环节。截至目前为止，在改善设备上，瑞丰、同聚已开始订购机器，于八、九月先后运张，对此政府和银行都给了必要的扶助。
    皮裘制造业，产品素著称全国，行销平、津、京、沪、东北各地。抗战前，日形衰落，目前销路仍是该业主要问题。全市现共四十六户，所制成品长期积压，不能销售。国营公司及银行，为了扶助该业资金周转继续生产，曾有计划的收购成品及贷款，先后计收羔皮袄六六三件，皮褥一六一四条，计一三、八○○、○○○元，并供给原料，加工代制。据统计一至六月半年的生产量，计各种皮衣皮褥三○六七件，用皮三八、七五二张。销售各种皮衣皮褥二、一三○件。该业现存原料羔皮二○、○○○张，＠皮二、五○○张，猫狐皮各一、○○○张。该业主要是解决销路问题，根据营业情况的发展，制定适合产销情况的生产计划如下：七月至十二月产量为羔皮袍八、二二五件，皮褥二四、六三○件，猫狐皮大衣一六五件等。按上述产量，尚需补入原料三一○、○○○张，上列数字能否实现，需视销售情况为转移。粗皮制造业共三十九户，上半年因纯系泡皮季节，仅六月份制出成品（皮大衣）一○二二件，下半年计划生产各式大小皮衣一五、○○○件，山羊皮褥二、○○○条。
    皮革业，全市共五十一户（包括皮条业十户），上半年产量为皮革一、一○二张，在产量上逐月增加，一月份产二一张，六月份则达一八八张。但因系手工业，质量低劣，不能外销，故今后提高质量，克服偷工减料，争制劣货的恶习，是该业发展的主要关键。下半年产量估计可达四二三六张，较上半年提高百分之七十三。该业中的皮条业只十户，解放后营业很好，其繁荣可达民国十八年前的程度。上半年产量为八九九张，下半年估计总产量达一六九八张，较上半年提高百分之四十六点九。
