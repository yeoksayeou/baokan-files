The Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative has played a significant role in the past six months in developing urban-rural mutual assistance and facilitating the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. The ten production cooperatives established by the cooperative (including sewing, weaving, shoemaking, knitting, etc.) and the four hosiery groups, wholesale their monthly products to suburban cooperatives through the business department to supply farmers. The coal factory, toothbrush factory, soy sauce factory, dyeing and weaving factory, etc., operated by the cooperative, not only supply consumer cooperatives in the city but also transport many products to rural areas. Similarly, agricultural products from rural areas are also supplied to various employee consumer cooperatives through cooperatives. This not only develops urban-rural trade but also reduces the exploitation suffered by workers and farmers by middlemen.

The grain and goods depot and the farmers' hostel play a significant role in connecting urban and rural material exchanges. The grain and goods depot has established trade relations with cooperatives in various regions. Since its opening in early May, it has sold more than 2.9 million jin of food grains and more than 8,300 bags of flour for cooperatives in various regions in two and a half months. The depot also directly purchased more than 1.54 million jin of food grains and more than 11,000 bags of flour from other places. Since its opening, the farmers' hostel has accommodated a total of more than 2,900 travelers (farmers, rural merchants, and personnel from various rural cooperatives) in three months, and has promoted the sale of agricultural and sideline products such as mountain goods (almonds, walnuts, etc.), food grains, native cloth, bristles, fur, and peanuts for farmers, and purchased farm tools, fertilizers, kerosene, and various daily necessities. The total amount of the above two items reached more than 68 million yuan.

In addition, in order to solve the problem of the sales of night soil in Beijing and the difficulty of applying top dressing in rural areas, the cooperative has purchased night soil in the city and lent it to farmers. In June, a total of more than 2.6 million jin was purchased and lent to farmers in Nanyuan, Huangcun, and along the Pinghan Railway.

    供销总社粮货栈两月半来
    购销粮面五百万斤
    农民招待所过往旅客近三千人
    【本市讯】北平市供销合作总社半年来在发展城乡互助、沟通城乡物资交流上起了相当作用。该社建立的十个生产合作社（包括缝织、制鞋、针织等）、四个织袜小组，每月产品都通过营业部批发到郊区合作社，供给农民。该社经营的煤炭厂、牙刷厂、酱油厂、染织厂等，除供应城内的职工消费合作社外，并有不少产品运销到农村。同样，乡村的农业品也通过合作社供给各职工消费合作社。这样既发展了城乡贸易，又减少了工人农民所受的中间剥削。
    在沟通城乡物资交流上起相当作用的是粮货栈和农民招待所两机构。粮货栈与各地区合作社建立了贸易关系，自五月上旬开业以来，两个半月中代各地合作社销售食粮二百九十余万斤，面粉八千三百余袋。该栈并到外埠直接采购食粮一百五十四万余斤、面粉一万一千余袋。农民招待所自开业后至今三个月共宿旅客（农民、农村商贩及各农村合作社人员）二千九百余名，并代农民推销山货（杏仁、核桃等）、食粮、土布、猪鬃、皮毛、花生等农副业产品，代购农具、肥料、煤油及各种日用品。以上两项总额达六千八百余万元。
    此外，合作社为了解决北平市大粪的销路和农村施用追肥困难的问题，曾在本市收购大粪，贷给农民。六月份共收购二百六十余万斤，贷给南苑、黄村和平汉路沿线各地农民。
