　　The Companion
    Pannuowa
    (By Soviet Pannuowa, translated by Su Ling, proofread by Cao Jinghua)
　　Part One: Night
    Chapter Two: Lina
    "I don't know what this is all about—repaying people's kindness like this."
    "What happened to you?" Lina asked.
    "If people are good to me," Kacha's mother said, walking into the room, "then I must be good to them, not like this."
    "What are you talking about?" Lina asked, not at all suspecting that it was about her.
    "Lina, we treat you like family," Kacha's mother said. "But what are you doing? Only young women nowadays would do such a thing."
    "I don't understand what you're talking about," Lina said. "I haven't done anything bad to you."
    "Don't defend yourself, dear, don't defend yourself. In these matters, it's always the woman's fault. Young men—they're like little calves: you lead them there, and they go there."
    "What do you think," Lina asked in surprise, "do you think I've fallen in love with Kacha's fiancé?" She laughed. "I haven't fallen in love with him!"
    "Lina, no one said you've fallen in love with him," Kacha's mother replied. "But he's fallen in love with you, and I'm sorry, but from your side, it's not good and not decent."
    Kacha collapsed onto the table and burst into tears.
    "I didn't know about this," Lina said in an angrily loud voice. "To hell with him, what do I want that damned thing for?"
    "What do you want him for, we don't know. This young man doesn't drink, he's interesting, and he earns a good salary..."
    Lina went to the room she shared with Kacha and lay down on the bed. She wanted to leave this place.
    Kacha came in, sat down beside her, and hugged her.
    "Don't be angry with my mother," she said. "I know it's not your fault. All men are just bastards."
    Lina thought of that mutton-selling bastard. She laughed. Kacha kissed her, feeling proud of her own generosity. They went to have dinner. Lina drank fresh milk and thought, "I don't want this. I'll leave."
    A few days later, she received a love letter from Kacha's fiancé. She tore up the letter and returned to the dormitory.
    The second incident happened half a year before her marriage.
    The men lived downstairs in the dormitory. The women's quarters upstairs were very clean. Brightly polished aluminum pots and sky-blue teapots sat on the stoves. The men fried eggs and boiled water for shaving in blackened enamel cups. They spat on the floor and tossed cigarette butts. Lina avoided contact with them.
    Once, as she was passing through the downstairs corridor, a man stopped her.
    "Comrade," he said in a low voice, "excuse me, do you have a thermometer?"
    "What thermometer?" Lina stopped and asked.
    "The ordinary kind, for taking temperature," he replied in a low voice, "I think I have a fever, but I don't have a thermometer to check."
    "I'll go ask," Lina said and went upstairs.
    She found a thermometer next door. She took it downstairs.
    The man was waiting for her in the same place, looking hopeful. He thanked her and asked which room she lived in. A quarter of an hour later, he came upstairs and knocked on the door.
    "39.4 degrees," he said, as if she had asked him his temperature. "Damn thing, I can't get rid of this illness."
    "What illness do you have?" Lina asked, who had never had any illness other than appendicitis.
    "Malaria."
    He lingered at the door, reluctant to leave. He had a thin, long face, a hooked nose, and an excited expression.
    "My quinine is all gone," he said, tilting his head back in pain, as if saying the words of Jesus: "Not my will, but thine be done." "I have to go to the pharmacy right away. I'm used to going out no matter how high my fever is," he said, waving his hand.
    It was deep winter, twenty-two degrees below zero. Lina said:
    "Give me the prescription, I'll go."
    "Oh, there's no need!" he said. "Why would you do that?"
    "As you wish," she replied.
    "It costs one dollar and twenty cents," he said, giving her the prescription and the money. His fingers were very thin: when he took the money out of his purse, his little finger remained outside the purse.
    She bought the quinine for him and gave him a cup of lemon tea. She felt sorry for him.
    They became friends. He came to see her every night, and when he felt unwell, she went downstairs to check on him. He told her everything about himself; he was an engineer. She was surprised: she didn't expect an engineer to live in the dormitory with the janitors.
    "I have a very good house," he explained. "I left it to my wife."
    He had had four wives. According to him, they had all left him. They left in a strange way: the house and all the property were left to them, while the man who had been abandoned by his wives moved lightly to the dwellings of other single men. Two of his wives had children.

　　第一部　夜
    第二章　琳娜
    “我不晓得这是什么一回事，——这样来报答人的好处呢。”
    “你发生什么事了？”琳娜问着。
    “假如人对我好，”喀嘉母亲说着，走进房间来，“那么，我一定要对人好，不象这样啊。”
    “你们在说什么呢？”琳娜问着，一点也不疑惑这些都是与她有关呢。
    “琳娜，我们把你当自家人看待，”喀嘉母亲说。“可是你干些什么呢，这能想得到吗？这只有如今的青年女子，才会作出这样事情呢。”
    “我不懂你们在说些什么，”琳娜说。“我对你们没作出一点不好的事啊。”
    “别辩护了，亲爱的，别辩护了吧。在这些事情里，从来总是女人的错。青年男子——就象一条小牛：你把它往那儿牵，他就朝那里走。”
    “你想什么呢，”琳娜惊奇的问道：“你想我爱上了喀嘉的未婚夫吗？”她笑了起来。“我没有爱上他呵！”
    “琳娜，谁也没有说你爱上了他，”喀嘉母亲回答着。“而是他爱上了你，对不起，这从你方面说来，不好而且不体面的。”
    喀嘉头倒到桌上，就痛哭起来。
    “我不晓得这一件事，”琳娜用气愤愤的响亮的声音说。“滚他的吧，我要这鬼东西作什么用呢？”
    “作什么用，这我们倒不晓得了。这位青年不喝酒，有趣，领的薪水又不错………”
    琳娜去到她和喀嘉同住的房间里，躺到床上。她想离开这儿了。
    喀嘉进来，坐到她跟前抱着她。
    “你别生我妈妈的气吧，”她说着。“我知道这不是你的错。一切男子不过全是混蛋罢了。”
    琳娜想起了那个卖羊肉的混蛋。她笑了起来。喀嘉吻着她，以自己的大量而觉得骄傲起来。她们吃晚饭去了。琳娜喝着鲜牛奶想道：“我不要这样了。我走吧。”
    过了几天以后，她收到喀嘉未婚夫写的一封情书。她把信撕了就回到寄宿舍了。
    第二件事是发生在她结婚前的半年。
    宿舍的楼下是男子住的。楼上女子住的地方都很清洁。炉子上放着明光发亮的铝锅和天蓝色的茶壶。男子们煎着鸡蛋，用薰黑了的珐琅杯子，烧着刮脸用的热水。他们往地板上吐着痰，掷着烟头。琳娜避免跟他们来往。
    有一次，当她从楼下走廊上过的时候，一个男子把她挡住了。
    “同志”，他低声的说，“对不起，你有温度表没有？”
    “什么温度表？”琳娜停住问道。
    “普通的，验体温的，”他低声的回答着，“我觉得发烧，可是没有温度表试温度。”
    “我马上去问一问，”琳娜说了就上楼去了。
    在隔壁找到一个温度表。她拿下楼来。
    那人在原地方怀着信心等着她。他谢了谢就问她住在那个房间里。过一刻钟，他到楼上敲着门。
    “三十九度四，”他说着，就象她问他的体温似的。“真该死的东西，总是摆不脱这毛病。”
    “你害什么病？”生平除了盲肠炎以外，什么病也没害过的琳娜问道。
    “疟疾。”
    他在门口徘徊着，不愿走开。他有一付又瘦又长的脸，钩鼻子，神色很兴奋。
    “我的奎宁也完了，”他说着，很痛苦的仰着头，就好象在说着：“况且，不是我的意志，而是你的意志”的那话的耶稣似的。“我要立刻到药房去。不论多么发烧我都出去惯了，”他挥着手说。
    当时是严冬，是零下二十二度的严寒。琳娜说：
    “把药方给我，我去。”
    “呵，这那里话！”他说着。“为什么这样呢？”
    “随你便吧，”她回答着。
    “这要一块二毛钱，”他说着，把药方和钱给了她。他的手指非常细：当他从钱袋里掏钱的时候，他的小手指留在钱袋外边。
    她替他把奎宁买来，给他喝了一杯柠檬茶。她很心痛他。
    他们相好起来了。他每天晚上来找她，当他觉得不舒服的时候，她就到楼下去招呼他。他把自己的一切都告诉了她，他是一个工程师。她吃惊起来：她没想到工程师会和车守们一起住在宿舍里呢。
    “我有很好的房子，”他解释道。“我把它留给我太太了。”
    他有过四个太太。据他说，她们全都离开他了。她们离开得很奇怪：房子和一切财物，全都留给她们，而这位被太太丢了的人，就轻装就道的搬到别的光身汉们的住处去了。他的两位太太是有过孩子的。
