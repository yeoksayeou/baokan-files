Overview of General Education in Beiping City in the Past Six Months
City Government News Office

　　Beiping's general education system is quite large and complex. In terms of quantity, there are 108 city-owned (including suburban) secondary schools, of which 82 are private, with a total of 42,944 students and 3,181 faculty and staff. There are 790 primary schools and kindergartens, of which 186 are private primary schools, with 158,756 primary school students and 4,673 faculty and staff. During the Kuomintang's rule, public middle schools, central primary schools, larger private middle schools, and Bao (street) primary schools were mostly directly controlled by reactionary elements. Private schools were complex in nature. Although many of them genuinely wanted to run schools well, some were running schools for profit and selling diplomas; others were establishing factions and had other intentions. Within the primary schools, private tutoring was still openly present. In addition, there was a large number of displaced middle schools (18 schools, with approximately 30,000 students), with students wandering and dropping out of school, and no one managing them, forming a very chaotic situation. After liberation, in order to prevent young people and children from dropping out of school and to receive a new education, the People's Government clearly announced the New Democratic education policy. At the same time, it took emergency measures to maintain the existing scale and to carry out the takeover and reform in a step-by-step manner. It quickly solved the livelihood problems of faculty and staff and poor students, sent away displaced schools, and restored school order. In the half-year from February to July, primary and secondary schools have carried out preliminary measures such as administrative reform, curriculum reform, and uniting and reforming old teachers.

　　The People's Government Education Bureau focused on public middle schools and central primary schools for the takeover and reform of schools before mid-May. From June, it turned to rectifying private middle schools. The main content of the takeover work in the early stage was to reform school administration. In the past six months, all public secondary schools have been taken over. Private middle schools that were reactionary schools were taken over or managed on behalf of them according to different situations, and then reorganized, merged, or closed down. A total of eight schools were taken over and managed on behalf of them, including Si Cun, Zhi Cheng, Zhongda Affiliated High School, Hui Tong, Zhong Zheng, Da Zhong, Wen Hua, Dong Fang, and Yi He. Northern and 93 schools were also handled differently according to different situations. During the takeover, a small number of principals and faculty and staff who insisted on being anti-people or were incompetent were replaced. The newly equipped principals and directors were mostly selected from prestigious faculty and staff in various schools in Beiping.

　　After the takeover, public primary and secondary schools first restored school order, abolished the fascist training system, and gradually established a democratic management system. For example, Boys' No. 2 Middle School, Boys' No. 4 Middle School, Boys' No. 5 Middle School, Girls' No. 2 Middle School, Beijing Normal University, and the central primary school in the 9th district have achieved better results, established a democratic management system, and changed the old relationship between teachers and students and the old relationship between schools and students. General public schools have achieved varying degrees of success in this regard, and have influenced and driven many private schools. This achievement is specifically reflected in the change in learning order and learning attitude; it is reflected in the rectification of the People's Student Aid Fund, and the democratic evaluation of conduct at the end of the semester (changing from the past system of having the reactionary training office assigning grades of A, B, C, and D to a mass appraisal based on learning attitude, life attitude, and service spirit). These have laid a good foundation and example for the universal implementation of the school democratic management system in the future.

　　The public schools taken over have been streamlined in terms of organization, changing from the past four offices of teaching affairs, training, general affairs, and sports to two offices of teaching and guidance and general affairs, implementing the integration of teaching and guidance; in terms of economy, openness and thrift have been achieved. Many school problems have been solved with funds from the public miscellaneous expenses. For example, Boys' No. 4 Middle School has added a lot of books and instruments, and Girls' No. 2 Middle School and Boys' No. 2 Middle School have repaired houses in addition to adding books and instruments.

　　Secondary schools abolished reactionary courses and added political courses; new textbooks were generally adopted for Chinese and history courses; all political teachers and many Chinese and history teachers in schools were organized for professional study, led directly or indirectly by the Education Bureau. Generally speaking, political and ideological education in middle schools has been strengthened. In three-quarters of the 108 public and private middle schools in the city, there are more appropriate political teachers and fixed political classes. The characteristic of political teachers is that they can integrate with students in life and play a great role in assisting school administration. The Education Bureau once collected more than 1,000 questions from middle school students and summarized them into five categories (namely, the understanding of the Soviet Union and the United States, the land reform issue, the Third World War issue, the understanding of the Communist Party and the Chinese revolution, and the intellectual issue). First, political teachers were organized to study these questions, and then students were educated in conjunction with various movements, with good results. However, political education is still weak today, and there are no appropriate teaching materials. It has not yet been able to permeate political and ideological education into various disciplines, social activities, and life guidance. Some political teachers still bear too heavy school administrative work, and some still have dogmatic tendencies. The situation is more serious in primary schools. Most primary schools do not have political education, and those with political classes have failed to educate through Chinese, general knowledge, life guidance, and children's reading materials. For example, Dongsi 42nd Street Primary School and Zhongnanhai Primary School have used deep teaching materials, which children cannot accept, or only learn a set of new terms. In the organization and leadership of student unions, many primary schools have committed formalism. These issues are to be resolved this semester.

　　In the past six months, the Education Bureau assisted the preparatory committee of the Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Union in holding 16 weekly lectures, organized speeches, forums, and research on political, Chinese, and history subjects. During the summer vacation, a summer study session was held jointly with the Teachers' Union, with the participation of 5,600 people. The content of the study focused on solving several fundamental viewpoints of historical materialism (labor viewpoint, class viewpoint), creating a climax of ideological transformation and laying the foundation for serving the people's education. On the issue of unity, the new and old teachers and the relationship between teachers and students in schools such as Girls' No. 2 Middle School have achieved harmonious mutual assistance.

　　The progress of all these tasks, whether in restoring learning order, establishing a democratic management system, rectifying the People's Student Aid Fund, evaluating conduct, learning politics and culture, or in the issue of unity, relies on the close combination of school administration and student unions, the vast number of students and activists, and especially the exemplary and leading role of Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members among faculty and staff and students, to ensure the smooth completion of the work.

　　In terms of social education, according to the statistics in June, 246 classes of workers' night schools have been established in various districts of the city, with 10,329 people; 605 classes of children's literacy classes, with 22,804 people; in addition, there are 12 study groups, with a total of 488 people. The Education Bureau also organized film work teams and sports work teams to work in factories. In the month and a half from late May to early July, the film team screened 32 films in the urban and suburban areas, with a total of approximately 43,380 viewers, of which workers accounted for 17,000. Sixteen mobile library stations were set up in the urban area, with a total of 97 trips and 660 books; the urban folk education center was improved, and the folk education centers in Changxindian, Mentougou, Nanyuan and other places in the suburbs were restored.

　　Although the city's education work has achieved the above results, there are still many problems that need to be solved urgently, such as the textbook problem, the curriculum standard problem, the teacher's full-time system problem, the problem of improving students' cultural level, and the political education problem mentioned above. These all need to be resolved step by step and in a planned manner. According to the proposals put forward at the Beiping All-Circles Representatives Conference, we should further improve the quality of teachers in a planned manner, develop adult education, solve the problem of children of workers entering schools, and support the development of private schools, so that Beiping's general education can be further improved.

　　半年来平市普通教育概况
    市府新闻处
    北平普通教育规模相当庞大，系统也很复杂。在数量上，市属（包括郊区）中等学校有一○八处，其中私立的占八二处，共有学生四二、九四四人，教职员三、一八一人；小学及幼稚园共有七九○处，其中私立小学占一八六处，小学学生有一五八、七五六人，教职员四、六七三人。在国民党统治时期，公立中学、中心小学、较大的私立中学和保（街）小学大都被反动分子直接掌握。私立学校性质复杂，虽然其中真心办学者不少，但也有借办学营利，买卖文凭的；也有树立派系，另有企图的。小学里面，私塾仍公然存在。此外，还有大批流亡中学（十八校，学生约三万人），学生流浪失学，无人管理，形成十分混乱的情况。解放后，为使青年儿童不致失学，并受到新的教育，人民政府一面明白宣布了新民主主义教育方针，一面采取了紧急处置，维持既有规模，并有步骤地进行接管与改革。迅速地解决了教职员及贫苦学生的生活问题，遣送了流亡学校，恢复了学校秩序。从二月份到七月份的半年间，各中小学已经进行了行政改革、课程改革、团结并改造旧教师等项初步措施。
    人民政府教育局对各学校的接管与改革工作，在五月中旬以前，以公立中学及中心小学为重点。从六月份起，才转入整顿私立中学。接管工作初期主要内容为改造学校行政。半年以来全部公立中等学校均已接管，私立中学凡属反动学校则按照不同的情况加以接管或代管，然后改组、合并或停办。计共接管和代管有四存、志成、中大附中、惠童、中正、大中、文华、东方、颐和等八校。北方、九三等校也根据不同情况有不同的处理。接管当中撤换了少数坚持反人民的或不称职的校长和教职员，新配备的校长、主任绝大多数都是从北平各校有威望的教职员中所选拔的。
    接管后的公立中小学校，首先恢复了学校秩序、取消了法西斯的训育制度、逐渐建立了民主管理制度。如男二中、男四中、男五中、女二中、北师及九区中心小学等校，已获得较好的成绩，建立了民主管理制度，改变了教员和学生的旧关系、学校和学生的旧关系。一般公立学校在这方面都有不同程度的成绩，并且影响和带动了不少的私立学校，这种成绩具体表现在学习秩序、学习态度的改变上；表现在整顿人民助学金，以及学期末民主评定操行（从过去由反动的训育处打甲、乙、丙、丁，改变为根据学习态度、生活态度、服务精神为标准的群众鉴定）等运动上。这些都对今后普遍开展学校民主管理制度建立了良好的基础与范例。
    接管的公立学校在机构上进行了精简，从过去的教务、训育、事务、体育四处改变为教导、总务二处，实行了教导合一；在经济上作到了公开和节约，由公杂费项下，解决了学校很多问题，如男四中已经添置了不少图书仪器，女二中和男二中除了添置图书仪器外，还修理了房屋。
    中等学校废止了反动课程，添设了政治课；国文与历史课大体上都采用了新教材；全部政治教员和好多学校的国文历史教员都组织了业务学习，由教育局直接或间接领导。一般说来，中学政治思想教育是加强了，全市一○八个公私立中学里面，四分之三的学校有了比较适当的政治教员，设有固定的政治课。政治教员的特点是在生活上能和学生打成一片，对协助学校行政起了很大作用。教育局曾经搜集了中学生的一千多个问题，归纳成五大类（即对苏联和美国的认识问题、土改问题、第三次世界大战问题、对共产党及中国革命的认识问题和知识分子问题），首先组织政治教员学习了这些问题，然后配合各种运动对学生进行教育，效果很好。但是今天政治教育还是薄弱的，还没有适当的教材，还未能把政治思想教育渗透到各学科及社会活动、生活指导诸方面，政治教员有的还负担着过重的学校行政工作，有的还存在着教条主义偏向。在小学情况更为严重，多数小学还没有政治教育，有政治课的也未能通过国语、常识、生活指导及儿童读物进行教育，如东四十二条小学、中南海小学都曾经采用过深的教材，使儿童接受不了，或只学会一套新名词。在学生会的组织领导上，不少的小学犯了形式主义的毛病。这些问题都是本学期所要解决的。
    半年来教育局协助中小学教联筹委会举办了十六次星期讲座，组织了演讲会、座谈会、和政治、国文、历史等科目的研究。暑假中联合教联举办了暑期学习会，参加的人数达五千六百人，学习内容集中在解决历史唯物主义几个根本观点（劳动观点、阶级观点），造成了思想改造的高潮，奠下了为人民教育服务的基础。在团结问题上，如女二中等校的新旧教师以及师生关系，都做到了融洽互助。
    凡是这些工作的进行，无论在恢复学习秩序上、在建立民主管理制度上、在整顿人民助学金上、在评定操行上、在政治及文化的学习上、或是在团结问题上，都是依靠了学校行政与学生会密切结合，依靠了广大同学及积极分子，尤其是依靠了教职员和学生中间的共党产员和青年团员的模范与带头的作用，才保证了工作的顺利完成。
    在社会教育方面，据六月份的统计，全市各区已经设立了工人夜校二四六个班，人数一○、三二九人；儿童识字班六○五班，人数二二、八○四人；此外还有十二个学习组，共四八八人。教育局还组织了电影工作队和体育工作队到工厂中去工作，五月下旬到七月上旬一个半月间，电影队在城郊各区一共放映了三十二场，参加观众共约四三、三八○人，其中工人占一七、○○○人。在城区曾经举办了十六个巡回图书站，共巡回九十七次，书籍六六○册；并改进了市内民教馆，恢复了郊区长辛店、门头沟、南苑等地民教馆。
    本市的教育工作，虽获以上成绩，但仍存在着不少问题极待解决，如教材问题、课程标准问题、教员专任制度问题、提高学生文化水平问题以及前面所述的政治教育问题等。这都需要有步骤有计划地加以解决。根据北平各界代表会议上所提出的各项提案，更应有计划地进一步提高教员质量，开展成人教育以及解决工人子弟入学问题，扶植私立学校发展，使北平普通教育更向前提高一步。
