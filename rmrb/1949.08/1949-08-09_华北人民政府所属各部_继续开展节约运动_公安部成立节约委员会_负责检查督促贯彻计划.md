    【Our Newspaper's News】The departments of the North China People's Government continue to carry out the thrift campaign. In order to ensure the completion of the thrift plan, the Public Security Department has established a thrift committee, responsible for inspection, supervision, and implementation. In addition to continuing to practice thrift in water and electricity appliances, the department plans to save one liang of millet per person per day for large, medium, and small canteens in July, and half a liang per person for the guard battalion, which is estimated to save more than 2,000 jin of rice, to be allocated by the government for rural disaster relief. In dealing with family issues, appropriate arrangements will be made to enable them to find employment and production, emphasizing "no one is allowed to just eat without working," and adhering to the principle of self-reliance and labor production. In June and July, the Enterprise Department saved a total of 1,547 jin of millet because all staff members paid attention to using waste paper and saving stationery. In terms of electricity saving, the staff dormitories have also been uniformly replaced with small light bulbs.
    The "Save Food and Expenses, Save Rice and Contribute to Disaster Relief" campaign initiated by the department has now ended, with all employees contributing more than 4,800 jin of rice. Many moving examples have emerged during the campaign. For example, Comrade Zhou Lunyuan of the Engineering Department has a heavy family burden, but he still resolutely contributed 200 jin of rice. Comrades advised him to contribute less, but he said, "It's nothing, we just need to be a little more frugal in our lives. The lives of the disaster victims make me very uneasy, and I will continue to help in the future."
    The Ministry of Health has conducted strict education on the water usage of odd-job personnel, calling on them to use as little water as possible to avoid waste. The kitchen has also implemented "long-distance procurement" to save on food costs. In the binding room of the North China Printing Factory, workers voluntarily proposed to increase voluntary labor during weekends, holidays, and even free activity time. From the beginning of July to the 20th, eight people processed a total of 129 hours, saving the factory a large amount of expenses. When repairing the business hall and warehouse, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative originally planned to use two carpenters, but in order to save money, they did it themselves, and used their spare time to clean up warehouse paper, etc. According to the calculation of labor costs, a total of 47,300 yuan was saved; other things such as arranging photos and flowers were done by themselves, trying not to spend public funds. When car No. 114 of the Secretariat was first allocated by the Military Control Commission, it was dilapidated, but after being repaired by the driver Zhao Zhixiao, it can now run very well. Originally, one gallon of gasoline could travel 13 li, but now it can travel 36 li. Driver Wang Jingxin, due to his political awareness after liberation, voluntarily contributed equipment, and the superior rewarded him with a bag of flour. He has the best record of saving gasoline, traveling about 42 li per gallon of gasoline, and can be a model for saving fuel.

    华北人民政府所属各部
    继续开展节约运动
    公安部成立节约委员会
    负责检查督促贯彻计划
    【本报讯】华北人民政府所属各部继续开展节约运动。公安部为保证节约计划的完成，特成立节约委员会，负责检查督促，贯彻执行。该部除水电用具继续厉行节约外，计划七月份大中小灶人员每人每天节约小米一两，警卫大队每人节约半两，计可节米二千余斤，交政府拨农村救灾。在处理家属问题方面，适当安插，使其就业生产，强调“不允许只吃饭不做事”，坚持自力更生劳动生产原则。企业部在六七两月中，因全体人员都注意了利用废纸，节省文具，共节约小米一千五百四十七斤。节电方面，职员宿舍也一律换了小灯泡。
    该处发起的“省吃俭用节约献米救灾”运动，现已结束，全体职工共献米四千八百余斤。运动中曾出现不少动人范例，如工程处周抡元同志，家庭负担较重，但仍坚决献米二百斤。同志们劝他少献一些，他说：“没有什么，我们生活方面只要稍刻苦一些就行了，灾胞的生活使我很不安，以后我还要继续帮助。”
    卫生部曾对勤杂人员用水方面进行了严格教育，号召尽量少用水，避免浪费。伙房也实行了“远途采购”，以节约菜金。华北印刷厂的装订房，在星期、假日甚至自由活动时间，自动提出增加义务工，自七月初至二十日止，八个人共加工一百二十九小时，节省工厂大笔开支。供销合作社在修整营业室及仓库时，原计划用木工两个，为了节约，他们就自己动手，并利用空暇时间清理仓库纸张等，如按工计算共节省四万七千三百元；其他如布置像片、花草等，都自己动手，尽量不开支公款。秘书厅一一四号汽车初由军管会拨来时，破烂不堪，经司机赵智孝修理后，目前已能跑得很好了，原先一加仑油行驶十三里现在可行三十六里。司机王敬信解放后由于政治觉悟，自动献出器材，上级曾奖励过一袋面粉。他节省汽油成绩最好，每加仑油行驶四十二里左右，可为节油模范。
