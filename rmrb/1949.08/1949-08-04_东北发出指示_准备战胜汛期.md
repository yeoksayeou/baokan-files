    Northeast Issues Instructions
    Prepare to Conquer the Flood Season
    [This newspaper reports] Due to the arrival of the flood season and recent continuous rainfall, the water levels of the Shenyang, Xinmin, and Fushun rivers in Northeast China have risen significantly. The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Northeast People's Government Committee issued an "Emergency Instruction on Flood Prevention Work" on July 24th. It called on all regions to prepare promptly, concentrate materials, and organize laborers. Especially in key flood prevention areas, responsible cadres at the provincial and county levels should be assigned to conduct inspections. Flood prevention committees must be established, with dedicated personnel in charge to unify command. If dangerous situations arise, efforts should be concentrated on timely repairs. Upstream and downstream areas should establish flood prevention intelligence to ensure unified action. Observation posts must be set up on critical dike tops to strictly prevent sabotage by special agents and bad elements. Each provincial party committee and government must report the progress of preparatory work to the Northeast Bureau and the People's Government Committee.

    东北发出指示
    准备战胜汛期
    【本报讯】东北沈阳、新民、抚顺各河水，因汛期已到，又加近来连日阴雨，以致水位高涨，中共中央东北局暨东北政委会特于七月二十四日发出“防汛工作紧急指示”。号召各地及时准备、集中器材、组织民工，尤其在防汛主要地区，应派省、县级负责干部负责检查，并须建立防汛委员会，设专人主持，统一指挥。如发生险工，则集中力量及时抢修，上下流应建立防汛情报，以求统一行动，在险要堤顶必须设监视哨，严防特务及坏分子破坏，各省委省府并须将准备工作情形报告东北局与政委会。
