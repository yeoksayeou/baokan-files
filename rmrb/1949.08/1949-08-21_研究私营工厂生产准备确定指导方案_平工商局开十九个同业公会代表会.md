[Beijing News] In order to implement the resolution of the Ping Municipality All-Circles Representative Conference on strengthening production guidance for private factories, the Beiping Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce yesterday (20th) specially convened representatives from nineteen trade associations participating in the Ping Municipal Industrial Association to report on the production situation of various industries for research and to determine specific guidance plans. At the meeting, the representatives reported on the current raw materials, production, and sales situation and problems of their respective industries. The best performing industries in terms of production and sales were metal product smelting and manufacturing, machinery, and flour, because the first two industries focused on rural areas, manufacturing large numbers of waterwheels, so their business was very developed. The flour industry is essential to people's livelihoods, and its output and sales are increasing daily. The more serious problem regarding raw materials is in machinery and paper-making. This industry used to rely entirely on waste paper, but now there is a shortage of waste paper. They should learn from state-owned paper mills to use waste cotton and rice straw to overcome raw material difficulties. The worst selling products are soda and foreign wine, these consumer goods need to wait until people's living standards improve before there is a market. In addition, the soap making and knitting industries are also facing difficulties. Due to poor quality and lack of fixed specifications, they cannot meet the needs of various markets, so they are difficult to sell. Representatives from the knitting industry hoped that the trade association and trading companies would quickly study and formulate fixed specifications. After the representatives of various industries finished their reports, Chen Ji, chief of the Industry Section of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, pointed out: Trade associations have made progress in mastering the situation of their respective industries. In the future, they should try to organize technical research and improvement. At the same time, the trade association organizations should be sound, and the members of the same industry should unite to do a good job in production. If individual industries have difficulties, they should take the initiative to find relevant agencies to study solutions, and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce will provide assistance. Then, representatives from various industries spoke one after another. Representatives from the leather-making industry and other industries expressed the hope that a production guidance institution would be established. Chief Chen immediately stated: This is a resolution of the All-Circles Representative Conference, and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce is working on it.

　  研究私营工厂生产准备确定指导方案
    平工商局开十九个同业公会代表会
    【本市讯】北平市工商局为贯彻执行平市各界代表会议关于加强私营工厂生产指导的决议，昨（二十）日特召集参加平市工业会的十九个同业公会代表开会，汇报各业生产情况以便加以研究，确定具体指导方案。会上，各代表分别汇报目前各行业原料、生产、销路的情况和问题。产销最好的是金属品冶制、机器、面粉等业，因为前两行业生产面向农村，大量制造水车，所以业务很发达。面粉业是为人民生活所必需，产量和销路逐日增多。原料问题较严重的是机器造纸，该业过去全赖废纸，现在缺乏废纸，应学习公营造纸厂改用废棉、稻草，以克服原料困难。销路最不好的是汽水和洋酒，这种消耗品须待人民生活水平提高之后方有出路。此外，是造胰和针织两业，由于品质不良，无固定规格，不能适应各地市场需要，所以不易销售。针织业代表希望由同业公会和贸易公司迅速研究订定固定规格。工商局工业科陈纪科长，在各业汇报完毕后，指出：各同业公会在掌握本业情况方面已有进步，今后应设法组织技术研究和改进。同时，公会组织要健全，同业间要团结把生产搞好。个别行业有困难的，要主动找有关机关研究解决办法，工商局当予以协助。接着，各业代表纷纷发言，制革等业代表希望成立生产指导机构，陈科长当即表示：这是各界代表大会的决议，工商局正着手进行。
