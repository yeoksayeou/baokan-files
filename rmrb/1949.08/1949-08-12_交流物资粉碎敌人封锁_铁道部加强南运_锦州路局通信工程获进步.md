    Exchange Materials, Smash Enemy Blockade
    Ministry of Railways Strengthens Southern Transport
    Jinzhou Railway Bureau Achieves Progress in Communications Engineering
    [This Newspaper Reports] To strengthen the exchange of materials between the North and the South and to smash the enemy's blockade conspiracy, the Transportation Bureau of the Military Commission of the Ministry of Railways set a deadline to complete the July transportation task. In early July, the Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Railways gloriously accepted the task of transporting northern materials to the areas of Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places. Thanks to the active efforts of railway workers along the way, the July transportation task has been fully completed. The Ministry of Railways has now formulated an August transportation plan, which is even more arduous than the July task, and requires efforts from all parties. In order to successfully complete future tasks, the Ministry of Railways hopes that all relevant departments will cooperate closely, unify their steps, and strive to successfully complete the glorious task of supporting the South. (Record)
    [Another News Item] The Jinzhou Railway Administration's communications engineering in the first half of this year has made significant progress compared to the past due to the increased enthusiasm of workers, with improved technical quality standards and work rates. All engineering projects exceeded the original plan by 67.5 percent. The main achievements included the restoration of the Shenyang-Yushu trunk line and the carrier telephone equipment in Jinzhou to places such as Beiping, Tianjin, and Shenyang. In overcoming difficulties and shortcomings, the following experiences were summarized: (1) The idea of reducing costs and improving efficiency must be implemented. We must focus on permanent construction and not be hasty or makeshift. (2) It is necessary to strengthen planning and organization. Because communication engineering construction is relatively dispersed, it should generally be divided into: a surveying and investigation team, a pole-erecting squad, a wire-hanging squad, a transportation squad, an inspection team, and a general affairs team. The division of labor should be more clearly defined, reasonable, and fixed. (3) Construction inspection is more important than completion inspection. Emphasis should be placed on regular and systematic strict inspections during construction, and unqualified work should be corrected in a timely manner. (4) Regarding the issue of materials, in addition to using methods such as relocation, adjustment, and collection to solve the problem, the state should establish a sufficiently large-scale electrical materials factory to supply various electrical equipment.

    交流物资粉碎敌人封锁
    铁道部加强南运
    锦州路局通信工程获进步
    【本报讯】为加强南北物资交流，粉碎敌人封锁阴谋，军委铁道部运输局限期完成七月份运输任务。七月初，铁道部运输局光荣接受任务，将北方物资运往京沪武汉一带，由于沿途铁路职工的积极努力，七月份运输任务已全部完成。现铁道部已拟定了八月份运输计划，该项计划较之七月份的任务更为艰巨，亟待各方努力。铁道部为要顺利完成今后任务，希望各有关部门密切合作，统一步调，为胜利完成支援南方的光荣任务而奋斗。（迹）
    【又讯】锦州铁路管理局今年上半年的通信工程，由于工人劳动热情的提高，比过去有了显著的进步，技术质量标准和工率都已提高，全部工程超过了原计划的百分之六七·五。主要修复了沈榆干线及锦州至平、津、沈等地的载波电话机械。在克服困难和缺点中，总结出几点经验：（一）必须贯彻减低成本及提高效率的思想，要按永久性建筑着眼，不能草率从事或因陋就简。（二）需要加强计划性与组织性。因通信工程施工时比较分散。一般应分为：测量调查组、立杆分队、挂线分队、运搬分队、检查组、总务组等几部分，分工更应注意明确、合理而固定化。（三）施工检查比竣工检查更重要，应着重在施工中经常进行有系统的严格检查，不合格的及时纠正。（四）材料问题，除用移设、调剂、搜集等办法解决外，国家应设立相当规模的电材厂，以供应各种电气设备。
