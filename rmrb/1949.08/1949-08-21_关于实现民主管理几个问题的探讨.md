　　Discussion on Several Issues Concerning the Implementation of Democratic Management
　　Our Newspaper Reporter Chen Ji
　　In the New Democratic state-owned enterprises, all employees are masters, and the implementation of democratic management is its main characteristic. In order to restore and develop the New Democratic economy, we must implement democratic management. This important experience has been proven by the practice of various highway transportation companies and factories in North China. Generally speaking, our comrades working in factories also know this experience, but whenever they actually do it, they often don't know where to start, feel that the workers and the masses do not have enough understanding of democratic management, and think that the masses are not interested in democratic management. Therefore, they do not have enough confidence in their thinking to implement democratic management and cannot carry out democratic movement work well. This is a ideological obstacle to the implementation of democratic management. We must point out that the implementation of democratic management requires us to truly believe in the workers, rely on the workers, and make the workers truly become the masters of the enterprise, so that democratic management can be realized.

　　Implementing Democratic Management in Factories Unleashes Creativity of Auto Workers
　　After the leading comrades of the Beijing Transportation Company launched a democratic movement in the company in June, they reviewed that before the implementation of the democratic movement, their thinking was mainly not trusting the workers, fearing that the workers would engage in mischief. When the car went on a business trip, they handed over the rights to the assistant and let the assistant sell the tickets; when the goods were found, they let the assistant hand in the account and report. They didn't consult with the workers in everything. For example, the company had few cars and many people. The leadership decided to organize the surplus workers to study, but they didn't tell the workers in advance, let the workers discuss it themselves before doing it, but only drew 34 people from the workers to study, making the workers confused, not knowing what to do after the study, and afraid of unemployment, so their emotions were uneasy. It was a good way to organize the surplus workers to study, but it was a mess because they didn't consult with the workers in advance. This shows that our working methods of not being able to rely on the workers well but only solving problems administratively and arbitrarily cannot solve the problem. Similarly, this phenomenon is also reflected in the Shijiazhuang Transportation Factory. The factory decided to transform a part of the machines into manufacturing auto parts in May, but without consulting with the workers to eliminate their ideological concerns, the workers did not understand the new changes and did not have the enthusiasm to study and improve new machine tools and working methods, so the production quality could not be improved, and the factory business could not be carried out. However, since the factory launched a democratic movement under the leadership of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Committee, the workers truly understood the truth of the factory transformation, and the workers and the masses actually became the masters of the factory, the workers not only eliminated their ideological concerns, but also actively improved the tools and fully exerted their great creativity. Worker Li Chaoyuan successfully improved the flat tool for the expander ring, and some workers transformed the piston rotary eye and the expander ring milling port, creating a new cylinder working method, which increased the original number of three cylinders that could be made per day to five. From these two examples, we can realize that only by relying closely on the workers and thoroughly eliminating the ideological obstacles of not believing in the workers and fearing that the workers will make suggestions can we launch a democratic movement and improve and overcome production problems.

　　Leadership's Self-Criticism Spirit is an Important Key to Implementing Democratic Management
　　While we are implementing democratic management, there are several interrelated issues that must not be ignored, that is, we must first launch criticism and self-criticism, especially self-criticism by the leadership. According to the experience of the highway transportation companies and factories in North China in launching democratic movements, it fully shows that self-criticism is an important key to opening up the gap between the leadership and the workers, and it is also a concrete manifestation of testing whether the leadership can truly establish a working method of relying on the working class to implement democratic management. The Beijing Transportation Company has created a good example in this regard. At first, their leaders and workers were very alienated, and the workers were afraid of the leaders and dared not make suggestions. When they discovered this shortcoming, the leaders thoroughly criticized themselves to the workers and the masses at the staff meeting. They reviewed the bureaucratic style of emphasizing administrative leadership and ignoring the workers and the masses in the past. After this period of criticism and self-criticism, the workers eliminated their ideological concerns about being laid off by the company, and boldly made suggestions to the leaders in the position of masters, and enthusiastically discussed, studied, and formed an enterprise management committee. The leadership relied on this enterprise management committee to successfully complete the task. For example, in June, the company felt that gasoline was lacking and the cost of gasoline vehicles was too high, so it decided to convert to charcoal vehicles. At that time, the leadership thought that they were unable to convert, but after the workers discussed and studied it, they gladly accepted the task. After two tests, they overcame the difficulties of the tools and successfully converted. Nine people spent nine days to complete the first charcoal stove, and the cost of labor and materials was only more than 80,000 yuan, which saved 50,000 yuan compared to contracting with private merchants. However, some leaders did not pay attention to this, and did not make criticism and self-criticism to the workers and the masses well. The workers always felt that the leaders were not of one mind with them and dared not make suggestions. For example, the workers of the Jizhong Automobile Factory reflected that "it is useless to make suggestions to the superiors!" Workers of the Taihang Company were expelled by the company for violating the rules and sent to the Public Security Bureau for handling. The workers reflected that the handling was improper, and the leaders did not explain or review it afterwards, making the workers fearful. The workers are afraid of the leaders, and the leaders become more alienated and separated from the workers. In this case, how can we implement democratic management?

　　Tell the Workers the Truth About the Factory, and the Workers Will Care About the Factory
　　Implementing democratic management means letting the workers be the masters of the house, so the income and expenditure of the factory should be told to the workers and the masses at any time or regularly. It is inevitable that the workers will care for and protect their factory at all times with the posture of masters if they have a clear understanding of the finances. For example, the workers of Tianjin Automobile Repair Factory, Beijing Repair Factory, Jizhong Factory and other units, at the Vehicle and Machine Affairs Conference held by the North China Highway Transportation Bureau in late July, raised the issue of democratic management and asked to know the truth about the factory's profit and loss. They said, "We know the expenses of our factory, and we will be motivated to work." "How can we be the masters of the house if we don't know the details of the factory?" Zhao Lianqi, a worker of Beijing Transportation Company, said, "To implement true democratic management, we must let everyone know how much it costs to run a car, whether it is a loss or a profit? We didn't know anything about it in the past, and we didn't have the energy to do things in the dark!" The Shijiazhuang Transportation Factory did not tell the workers the monthly income and expenditure accounts. The workers saw the factory repairing large cars, and they secretly calculated that the factory must have made money. The workers discussed that the factory made money, but never cared about the workers' lives. In fact, the factory's income was not very good at that time. If the general affairs expenses and other indirect expenses were announced together, the workers would know the truth and would not disagree with the leaders, saying that the leaders did not care about their lives.

　　Workers' Welfare Demands Should Be Resolved and Explained in a Timely Manner
　　Always care about the workers' lives and welfare issues, and resolve the workers' welfare demands in a timely manner under possible and necessary conditions. This issue is also intertwined with democratic management and cannot be separated. Leading comrades must clearly recognize that we must resolutely overcome and avoid all thoughts of deducting workers' welfare and not caring about workers' demands. When the highway transportation companies and factories in North China launched democratic movements, most of the opinions raised by the workers belonged to this aspect. If we think ideologically that the workers do not understand long-term interests, do not believe in the workers, and feel that the workers are mostly circling around welfare, we are afraid that the factory will be damaged in the future if democratic management is realized. This idea is wrong. Precisely because the workers raise welfare issues, we must let the workers discuss democratically and rely on the workers to solve this problem. The workers of Shijiazhuang Transportation Factory put forward suggestions for improving food, dormitories and sanitary equipment. The leadership immediately helped the workers to discuss widely, and immediately improved the welfare undertakings that could be improved according to the appropriate requirements of the workers and the masses. The workers reflected one after another: "Our opinions have been implemented!" At that time, the leadership patiently explained in detail some of the opinions raised by some workers that the factory could not do for a while, such as the request to build family dormitories, according to the factory's entire economic situation, and the workers no longer insisted. They were all very satisfied and enthusiastically helped the leaders to solve a lot of difficulties. Everyone ordered a production plan and set off a wave of production competition, improving the quality of production. In May and June, the factory increased its income by 22,000 jin of millet. However, some factories, such as Huazhong Company, are among them. They did not explain the workers' welfare demands in a timely manner, nor did they solve them properly, so that the workers were unwilling to make suggestions, and their work mood was not good. This lesson has now been paid attention to and corrected.

　　Our comrades working in factories should pay attention to these issues that cannot be separated from democratic management at any time, clarify them ideologically, and master them well in practical actions, then the implementation of democratic management will be easier to succeed.

　　关于实现民主管理几个问题的探讨
    本报记者  陈迹
    在新民主主义的国营企业里，全体职工都是主人，实行管理民主化是其主要的特点。为要恢复与发展新民主主义经济，我们必须要贯彻民主管理，这一个重要经验同样的被华北各公路运输公司工厂的实践所证明了。一般说来，我们工厂工作的同志也都知道这个经验，但是每当他们实际去做的时候，又往往不知从何下手，觉得工人群众对于民主管理没有足够认识，以为群众对于民主管理不感兴趣。因此，他们在思想上对于实现民主管理总没有足够的信心，不能很好展开民主运动工作。这是实现民主管理的思想障碍。我们必须指出，实现民主管理是要让我们真正相信工人，依靠工人，使工人真正成为企业的主人翁，那么民主管理始克实现。
　　实行了工厂民主管理汽车工人发挥创造性
    北平运输公司的领导同志在六月份该公司展开了民主运动以后，曾检讨他们在未实行民主运动之前，思想上主要是对工人不相信，怕工人搞鬼，汽车出差时，把权利交给助手，让助手卖票；找货回来，让助手交帐汇报。凡事又不和工人商量，就如公司的车少人多，领导上决定把多余的工人组织起来学习，但事先没有告诉工人，让工人自己讨论之后再做，而只是从工人中抽出了三十四人学习，搞得工人群众莫明其妙，不知道学习以后怎么办，害怕失业，情绪不安。本来组织多余的工人学习，是好的办法，但以事先未和工人商量，反而弄得一塌糊涂。这说明了我们不能很好的依靠工人而只是行政上独断独行的去解决问题的工作方法，是解决不了问题的。同样的，这种现象又表现在石家庄交通工厂中，该厂决定在五月份把一部份机器改成制造汽车配件，但是没有和工人商量，消除工人思想顾虑，工人对于新的改变不了解，没有热情去研究与改进新的机器工具与工作方法，因而生产质量不能提高，工厂业务无法开展。但是自从该厂在石家庄市委领导下，展开民主运动，让工人真正了解到改造工厂的实情，使工人群众实际成为工厂的主人翁，工人们不仅消除了思想上的顾虑，而且积极的改进工具，充分发挥了伟大的创造力。工人李朝元成功地改进了涨圈平面工具，有些工人并改造成活塞旋眼，涨圈铣口，创造了新的缸筒工作法，使原来每天只能做三个缸筒，增加到五个。从这两个例证，我们可以认识到唯有紧紧依靠工人，彻底肃清那些不相信工人害怕工人提意见的思想障碍，才能展开民主运动，改进与克服生产上的问题。
　　领导上的自我批评精神是实行民主管理重要关键
    在我们实行民主管理的同时，又有几点决不可忽视的相联问题，那就是首先要展开批评检讨，特别是领导上的自我批评。根据华北各公路运输公司工厂开展民主运动的经验，充分说明了自我批评是打开领导和工人间隔阂的重要关键，也就是考验领导上是不是真正能够树立起依靠工人阶级实行民主管理的工作方法的具体表现。北平运输公司在这方面创造了很好的典例，起先他们的领导与工人间非常疏远，工人害怕领导，不敢提意见。当他们发现了这个缺点，领导上曾在职工大会上彻底的向工人群众作自我批评。对于过去强调行政领导而漠视工人群众的官僚主义作风，一一加以检讨。经过这段批评检讨之后，消除了工人思想上怕被公司裁掉的顾虑，真正以主人翁的地位，大胆的向领导上提意见，并热烈的讨论、研究和组成了企业管理委员会。领导上就依靠这个企业管理委员会，胜利完成了任务。例如六月份公司方面感到汽油缺乏，汽油车花费成本过高，乃有改装木炭车的决定，那时领导上以为自己无力改装，但经工人们讨论研究之后，他们欣然接受了该项任务，他们经过两次试验，克服了工具的困难，果然改造成功。九个人花了九天功夫，完成了第一部木炭炉，工料费只有八万多元，较比给私商包办节省了五万元。但是，有些领导上没有注意及此，不很好向工人群众作批评检讨，工人们总觉得领导上和他们不一条心，不敢提意见，例如冀中汽车工厂的工人反映说：“对上级提意见是不中用的！”太行公司工人因犯规被公司开除送交公安局处理，工人反映处理不当，领导上事后未作解释亦未检讨，弄得工人恐惧不已。工人害怕领导同志，领导就越和工人脱离、隔阂。那么在这种情况下，又怎能实现民主管理呢？
　　把工厂实情告诉工人工人才会关心工厂
    实行民主管理，就是让工人当家作主人，因而关于工厂的开支盈亏情况，应该随时或定期告诉工人群众。工人们对于财政有了清楚的了解，就会以主人翁的姿态时时刻刻关心爱护自己的工厂，这是必然的道理。例如天津汽车修理厂、北平修理厂、冀中工厂等单位的工人，在七月下旬的华北公路运输总局召开的车务机务会议上，曾就民主管理问题，纷纷要求知道工厂盈亏的实情，他们说：“我们知道了我们工厂的开支，我们做事，心里才有劲。”“我们不知道厂里的底细，又怎能叫我们当家作主？”北平运输公司工人赵联启说：“实行真正的民主管理，就要让大家都知道跑一趟车的成本有多少，亏本还是赚钱？过去我们一点儿也不知道，坐在闷葫芦里，干起事来哪儿有劲？”石家庄交通工厂没有把每月收支帐目告诉工人，工人眼见工厂在修理大车，他们暗地里计算工厂一定赚了钱，工人便议论说，工厂赚了钱，从不关照咱们工人生活。其实那时工厂的收入并不算好，如果把总务费和其他间接费合并公布出去，工人知道了实情，就不会和领导上闹意见，说领导上不关心他们生活了。
　　对工人福利要求要及时解决解释
    随时关切工人生活福利问题，并在可能与必要的条件下，及时解决工人的福利要求。关于这一个问题，也是和民主管理牵连在一起而不可分开的，领导同志必须确切认清，凡是克扣工人福利不关心工人要求的思想，坚决要克服避免。华北各公路运输公司工厂在开展民主运动之际，工人们所提的意见，大半是属于这一方面的。如果我们在思想上以为工人不懂得长远利益，不相信工人，觉得工人多在福利上打圈子，恐怕将来实现了民主管理，会把工厂搞坏。这种思想是错误的，正因为工人提出福利问题，我们就更要让工人民主讨论，依靠工人来解决这个问题。石家庄交通工厂工人提出改进伙食、宿舍以及卫生设备的意见，领导上随即帮助工人广泛讨论，根据工人群众的适当要求，立即改进了可能改进的福利事业，工人们纷纷反映：“咱们的意见有了着落！”当时领导上对于有些工人提出的而工厂一时不能做到的意见，例如要求建筑家属宿舍等问题，耐心的根据工厂整个经济情况，加以详细的解释，工人们也就不再坚持了。他们一个个都非常满意，热心帮助领导上解决了不少的困难，大伙儿订生产计划，掀起生产竞赛的热潮，提高生产质量，在五六两个月内，工厂增加了两万二千斤小米的收入。但也有些工厂，如华中公司就是其中之一，他们对于工人的福利要求，不及时解释，也没有适当解决，致使工人们不愿提意见，工作情绪也不好。这个教训，现已被他们注意改正了。
    这些和民主管理不能分开的问题，我们工厂工作的同志应该随时注意，在思想上明确起来，在实际行动上很好的掌握下去，那么民主管理的实现就较比容易成功了。
