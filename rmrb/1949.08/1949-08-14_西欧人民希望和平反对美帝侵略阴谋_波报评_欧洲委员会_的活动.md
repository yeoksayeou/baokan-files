Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 13th: Warsaw Dispatch from Polish Press Agency: A Warsaw newspaper recently published an article commenting on the first session of the "Council of Europe" held in Strasbourg, stating: The reactionary governments of Greece and Turkey, hated by their own citizens, have been invited to participate in the meeting. The delegations from other countries attending the committee, selected by the government or the majority party in parliament, certainly cannot represent their people either. The representatives of the various countries rushed to Strasbourg only because the powerful patron of the U.S. State Department hoped they would demonstrate the so-called "unity" of Europe. The committee serves as a smokescreen for the U.S. plan to bring West Germany into the "North Atlantic Federation," establish the "theoretical" signboard of the strategic part of the North Atlantic Treaty, and, under the slogan of economic "liberalism," enable American capital to penetrate Europe. However, the hundreds of politicians who went to Strasbourg themselves know that they do not represent the people of Western Europe. The people of Western Europe hope for peace, and they oppose further schemes in the service of American imperialism. The people of London, Paris, and Vienna have shown this during the recent visits of American generals.

    西欧人民希望和平反对美帝侵略阴谋
    波报评“欧洲委员会”的活动
    【新华社北平十三日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：华沙报顷著文评论在斯特拉斯堡召开的“欧洲委员会”的第一届会议称：受其本国公民憎恨的希、土反动政府，已受邀参加了会议。由政府或议会多数派遴选的出席委员会的其他国家的代表团，当然也不能代表他们的人民。各国代表之赶赴斯特拉斯堡，只是因为美国国务院的强有力的保护人希望他们表现所谓欧洲的“团结”。委员会是充作美国使西德参加“北大西洋联邦”、树立北大西洋公约战略部分的“理论”招牌、以及在经济的“自由主义”的口号下，使美国资本能打入欧洲的计划的烟幕。但是，前往斯特拉斯堡的成百的政客们自己也知道，他们并不代表西欧的人民。西欧人民希望和平，他们反对替美帝国主义服务的进一步阴谋。伦敦、巴黎和维也纳的人民，在最近美国将军们往访时，已表明了这一点。
