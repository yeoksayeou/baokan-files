    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th. The "Liberation Daily," the organ of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, published an important editorial on the 5th entitled "Emergency Mobilization to Overcome the Autumn Flood and Seize the Time to Plant Late Autumn Crops!" calling on Party, government, military, and civilians in all areas along the Yangtze River, along rivers, along lakes, along the coast, and in areas that may be hit by the autumn flood, as well as in disaster-stricken areas, to mobilize urgently to fight the autumn flood and seize the time to plant late autumn crops. The editorial pointed out that the floods in East China this year are particularly severe, almost covering the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, with the most serious being in northern Anhui, where more than four million people have been affected. In addition, typhoon attacks have made the disaster even more serious (especially in southern Jiangsu). This summer, according to Jianghai Customs data, the Yangtze River water level during the summer flood generally approached the highest water level in 1931, and in the typhoon, the areas along the river and lakes near Nanjing and Shanghai mostly exceeded it. Moreover, the autumn flood in the lower reaches of the rivers is usually higher than the summer flood. Therefore, the task of overcoming the upcoming autumn flood will be extremely arduous.

    The editorial went on to denounce the Kuomintang bandit gang for only knowing how to plunder the people's wealth over the years, neglecting water management work, resulting in disrepair of defenses and siltation of river channels. Recently, they have carried out inhuman bombing of important dikes, rescue workers, and disaster victims, and lurking bandits and special agents have also sabotaged dikes and attacked personnel leading the rescue efforts, thus further aggravating the temporary disaster of the people. At the same time, the editorial pointed out that, thanks to the leadership of the People's Government and the active repair work of millions of people, braving storms and heavy rain, about four million mu of disaster-stricken farmland in northern Jiangsu alone have been saved. In flood prevention and rescue, true people's heroes and people's meritorious servants have emerged in various places, some even sacrificing themselves gloriously. Governments at all levels, despite difficult economic conditions, have still allocated huge amounts of grain, funds, and materials to assist the people in launching rescue and self-help movements. Therefore, under the leadership of the People's Government and the conscious efforts of the broad masses of people, the disaster will undoubtedly be greatly reduced.

    华东局机关报解放日报号召
    紧急动员战胜秋汛
    这是我各地党政机关面临着的严重考验
    我们必须在这个考验中加强与群众联系
    【新华社上海七日电】中共中央华东局机关报“解放日报”五日以“紧急动员，战胜秋汛，抢种晚秋！”为题发表重要社论，号召沿江、沿河、沿湖、沿海一切可能被秋汛袭击的地区和已受灾地区的党政军民紧急动员起来，为战胜秋汛及抢种晚秋而斗争。社论指出：华东水灾今年特别严重，几乎遍及苏浙皖三省，最重者为皖北，灾民已达四百余万。加之台风袭击，灾情更其严重（特别是苏南）。今夏长江水位，根据江海关材料，在夏汛中一般已接近一九三一年最高水位，在台风中京沪沿江沿湖则多超过。而江河下游，秋汛每较夏汛为高，因此，战胜即将到来的秋汛的任务将极为艰巨。
    社论继痛斥国民党匪帮，多年来只知搜括民脂民膏，置治水工作于不顾，致提防失修、河道淤塞，最近复对重要圩堤、抢险员工及灾民进行灭绝人性的轰炸，潜伏匪特亦破坏圩堤，并袭击领导抢险的人员，因而更加重了目前人民暂时的灾难。同时，社论指出，由于人民政府领导千百万人民，不避大风暴雨，积极抢修，仅苏北即已救出灾田四百万亩左右。在防汛抢险中，各地都涌现了真正的人民英雄与人民功臣，有的并奋不顾身而光荣牺牲。各地政府在困难的经济情况下，仍拨出巨额的粮款器材，协助人民展开抢险与自救运动。因此，在人民政府领导及广大人民自觉的努力下，灾祸无疑地是会大大减轻的。
