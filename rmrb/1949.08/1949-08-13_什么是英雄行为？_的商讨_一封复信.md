Discussion on "What is Heroic Behavior?"
A Reply Letter
Deng Xiang

Your letter has been received. I have read the article "What is Heroic Behavior?" published on page six of the People's Daily on July 29th. Regarding my "insights," due to my superficial learning and intellectual laziness, I have not promptly organized my thoughts after reading it. This demonstrates a lack of seriousness and diligence in my learning attitude. Therefore, your statement that "after reading an article, we should repeatedly reflect, understand its essence, and reflect on our own thoughts, and write down our insights" is precisely aimed at my shortcomings. I lack these, and I am determined to correct them.

These past few days, I have taken the time to read it several times again. It has made me realize that this is indeed "an article with educational significance." The issues are debated so sharply, which makes it clearer to distinguish between what is correct and what is incorrect. This is indeed "one of the best methods of collective learning."

× × × ×

You remember we once talked about it, and I asked you, "What exactly is the difference between new heroism and individual heroism?" I told you about my experience at the Party school. At that time, some comrades in the group criticized me for not having a strong labor viewpoint. So I resolved to carry a hundred loads of water within a month, and I challenged others to show that I wanted to establish a labor viewpoint. I only focused on carrying water and paid little attention to other things! At the assessment, I asked them, "Is this considered a merit?" They all unanimously said, "This is individual heroism!" At the time, I could not accept such criticism. "I carried the water, and I still get labeled as an individual hero!" They also said, "You didn't effectively motivate other comrades to carry water; it was to show off yourself!" I had thought, "To be a new hero, you have to motivate others" (without even considering the ideological aspect). At the same time, I asked myself, "When our People's Liberation Army is in battle, aren't the first ones to scale the city walls just a few people? How many people do you have to motivate to be considered new heroism?" I thought about it again and again, and it became blurry!

Today, I saw in "What is Heroic Behavior?" the question raised in the speeches, "What did they sacrifice their lives for? Why are they called heroes?" I asked myself, "What is the value of your behavior?" "What kind of cause is this behavior completing?" From this perspective, I was not acting to show off myself at the time, to "prove myself," but definitely not for the cause of the Party, the class, or the people, but simply to act because "you said my labor viewpoint was not strong, so watch me!" Although my actions appeared relatively active, I did not resolve the issue ideologically at the time. This shows that my level of awareness at the time was too low. At the same time, it also shows that using the perspective of individual heroism to view the "People's Liberation Army scaling the city walls" cannot lead to a correct understanding, and one can never understand their thoughts and feelings.

Now, I am beginning to understand the meaning of "a Communist Party member must be a conscious proletarian fighter." We should intensify our learning so that we can become a conscious, thoughtful, and purposeful person—struggling to overthrow the old society of man exploiting man, and to establish a new society of no oppression, a communist society. Everything stems from this "noble ideal." Otherwise, it is just reckless courage or blind action.

Therefore, clearly understanding "What are we working for?" "Who are we working for?" is very important. In action, the thought must be "the People's Liberation Cause First," and only then can it be considered true heroic behavior. In this way, one's spirit will be full and one's emotions will be healthy in work and study. I feel that the reason why I was "hot and cold" in the past was due to a lack of that concept.

× × ×

You said that in the past you "had a very narrow understanding of heroic behavior, as if only 'death' could be considered true heroic behavior." Wasn't that how I understood it in the past? Looking at it today, this idea is incorrect. "Death" for whom? Why die? Without clarifying these, then what is the meaning of "death"? From here, we can see that our understanding of "heroic behavior" always has some one-sided ideas of being "sensational" and "famous in one's time," so we always want to be "figures" riding on people's heads, unwilling to do the regular, specific, small things. Does this mean that the great actions of factories and rural areas working hard to produce in support of the front lines do not count as "heroic behavior"? They are all unsung heroes. Because in our country, New China, heroic behavior has become mass-based.

I examine myself, in my work I cannot patiently solve the ideological and life problems of certain classmates, I am impatient in my heart, "Why is it so troublesome!" This is the result of a lack of the concept of "wholeheartedly serving the people." In a sense, "revolution is a long-term trouble." It seems that my work style is not honest enough. Lenin said: "Do more daily, small, troublesome work, and say less pretty words." I am suffering from this disease, and I plan to use it as my motto.

The problem is obvious, as long as we are willing to sacrifice ourselves for the people, for the greatest benefit of the greatest number. Having such a belief, and being able to do so.

When I read "The Bridge," I felt: "Old Liang is also a Communist Party member, and he is so active, not sleeping for three days, 'Why can't I do it?' I'll do a good job!" But after being active for two days, my energy wasn't so great anymore! It seems that my own activeness is not out of a high sense of responsibility for some "cause," but due to the stimulation of the characters, comparing myself for the sake of "personal" reputation and status. How can these be frequent and lasting?

I once asked myself: "What kind of person am I?" A Communist Party member. "What kind of qualities should I acquire?" The noble qualities of a Bolshevik. However, I still lack the concept that "the interests of the Party are above all else." I should strengthen my training in the future.

I have these fragmented thoughts after reading that article. What I have said is not concrete or profound enough. Please write back with your opinions and criticisms. With respectful greetings!

### “什么是英雄行为？”的商讨  一封复信

    “什么是英雄行为？”的商讨
    一封复信
    邓祥
    来信收到。七月二十九日的人民日报第六版所刊载的“什么是英雄行为？”我是读过的，说到“心得”，由于学习的稀松，思想上的懒惰，没有及时的，把读后心得整理出来，这表现出我在学习态度上不够严肃认真。所以，你说的“当我们读过一篇文章后，应该反复思考，领会其精神实质，并联系自己的思想，反省一下，写出心得来”这正是针对我的病根而言，我缺乏这些，我决心纠正。
    这两天，我又抽功夫读了几遍。使我体会到，这的确是“一篇富有教育意义的文章”，问题争论的是那样尖锐，这样才能使正确的与不正确的更明确。这的确是“最好的集体学习方法之一”。
    ×          ×          ×      ×
    你还记得，我们曾在一起谈过，我问你：“究竟，新的英雄主义与个人英雄主义有什么不同？”我曾把在党校的事告诉你，在那时，小组里，有的同志批评我，劳动观点不强，我就立志，在一个月内要挑一百担水，也向别人挑战，以表示我要建立劳动观点，只顾担水了，别的事就很少管了！到鉴定时，我就问他们：“这算个优点不？”他们都一致的说“这是个人英雄主义！”当时，我不能接受这样的批评。“水，挑了，还落一个个人英雄主义！”他们还说“你担水并没有把其他同志很好的带动起来，是为了表现个人！”我曾想过“要做新英雄就要带动别人”（还没有提到思想上去），同时，我又反问自己：“当我们解放军，在战斗中，首先登城的人，不也是几个人吗？究竟带动多少人，才算新英雄主义呢？”我想来想去，模糊了！
    今天，我看到了“什么是英雄行为？”中，在发言中所提出的问题“他们到底为了什么而牺牲自己的生命呢？为什么称他们为英雄呢？”我就反问自己：“你的行为有什么价值呢？”“这一行为是为着什么样的事业而完成呢？”由此观之，我当时还不是为了表现自己，为了自己“争口气”，决不是为党的、阶级的、人民的事业，单纯地为“你们说我劳动观点不强，看我的”而行动。行动上虽然表现的较积极，然而，在当时，没从思想上解决问题。这就说明我当时的觉悟程度太低。同时也可说明用个人英雄主义的角度，去看“人民解放军登城”又哪能得到正确的了解呢？也决不能体会他的思想感情。
    如今，我开始明确了“一个共产党员必须是一个自觉的无产阶级的战士”的意义。我们应该加紧学习，使自己成一个有觉悟，有思想，有目标的——为了打倒一个人剥削人的旧社会，为了建立一个没有人压迫人的新社会，共产主义社会而斗争。一切由这一“崇高理想所产生”。否则，便是血气之勇，或盲目的乱干一阵。
    因之，明确地认识“为了什么干？”“为谁干？”是非常重要的事。在行动中，思想上必须是“人民解放事业第一”，这样才算真正的英雄行为。这样，在工作中，学习中，精神才会饱满，情绪才能健康。我感到我过去所以“忽冷忽热”也就是缺乏那种观念。
    ×      ×          ×
    你说，你过去“对英雄行为了解的很狭隘，好象只有‘死’才算是真正的英雄行为”，我过去又何尝不是那样了解？在今天来看，这种想法是不正确的。“死”为谁而死？为什么而死？不明确这些，那么“死”又有什么意义呢？从这里可以看出我们对“英雄行为”的了解，总是有些“轰轰烈烈”“煊赫一世”的片面的想法，所以总想做个什么骑在人头上的“人物”，不愿作经常的、具体的小事。难道说，工厂里，农村中为了支援前线而努力生产的伟大行动，就不算“英雄行为”？他们都是无名英雄。因为在我们的国家里，新中国，英雄行为已成为群众性的了。
    我检讨，在工作中对某些同学思想上、生活上的问题不能耐心地去解决，心里急躁，“怎么这么麻烦！”这是缺乏“全心全意为群众服务”观念的结果。在某种意义上讲“革命就是个长期的麻烦”，看来，我那种工作作风是不够老实的。列宁说：“多做日常的，细小的，麻烦的工作，少说漂亮话”。我正犯了这种病，我准备把它做为座右铭。
    问题很明显，只要我们肯于牺牲个人，为人民，为最大多数的最大利益去努力。有这样的信念，而且能这样做。

    当我看过“桥”后，我感到：“老梁也是个共产党员，人家那么积极，三天不睡觉，‘我’怎么不行呢？好好干！”但是积极了两天，劲又不太大了！看来自己所以积极，不是出于什么“事业”的高度责任心，而是由于人物的刺激，比一下为了“个人”的名誉，地位。这些，哪会经常并持久下去呢？
    我曾扪心自问：“我到底是一个什么样的人？”共产党员。“我应该使自己获得什么样的品质？”布尔什维克的高尚品质。但是，我还缺乏“党的利益高于一切”的观念。今后应加强锻炼。
    我读过那篇文章后有这些零碎的感想。说的还不够具体、深刻。请你来信提出意见、批评。此致敬礼！
