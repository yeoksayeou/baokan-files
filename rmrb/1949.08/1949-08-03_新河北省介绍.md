Introduction to the New Hebei Province
By our reporter Chen Ji

The Third Enlarged Meeting of the North China People's Government Committee passed important resolutions on the change of administrative divisions in North China and the organization and personnel appointments of the Hebei Provincial People's Government on July 28th. On August 1st, the Hebei Provincial People's Government was officially established under orders. This is a brilliant symbol of the great victory of the Chinese people, worthy of our joy and warm celebration.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, due to the military division by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandit gangs, in order to victoriously strike the enemy, Hebei Province had to break the old provincial boundaries and divide into small strategic units such as Central Hebei, Southern Hebei, Eastern Hebei, Northern Yue (part), and Taihang (part) according to the natural situation and the enemy's division. This was entirely necessary under the war situation at the time and played a great role in defeating the enemy. Today's situation has fundamentally changed, and the divided situation no longer exists. The restoration of the original establishment of Hebei Province is not only possible but also very necessary. Hebei Province has a vast area, bordering the Bohai Sea in the east, leaning against the Taihang Mountains in the west, reaching Daming in the south, and bordering the Great Wall in the north, serving as a hub connecting the two major liberated areas of North China and Northeast China. Of the counties under the jurisdiction of the old Hebei Province, except for Dongguang, Nanpi, Yanshan, Qingyun, Ningjin, Wuqiao, Nanle, Qingfeng, Puyang, Dongming, and Changyuan, which have been划归划归劃歸劃歸划歸 assigned to other provinces, the counties under the jurisdiction of the former Central Hebei, Southern Hebei, Eastern Hebei, Taihang administrative offices and the Chahar Province that originally belonged to the old Hebei Province were all划归劃歸劃歸划归划歸 assigned to the newly established Hebei Province. Guantao, Linqing, Qiuxian, Xiajin, Wucheng, and Enxian, six counties of the old Shandong Province, originally under the jurisdiction of the Southern Hebei Administrative Office, and Wu'an, Shexian, and Linzhang, three counties of the old Henan Province, originally under the jurisdiction of the Taihang Administrative Office, were also划归劃歸劃歸划归划歸 assigned to Hebei Province. Guanxian, Shenxian, Gaotang, Yongzhi, Wuxun, and the Chaocheng part of Yuanchao, and seven counties including Pingyuan, originally under the jurisdiction of the Southern Hebei Administrative Office, were划归劃歸劃歸划归划歸 assigned to other provinces. The province is divided into ten special districts: Tangshan, Tianjin, Tongxian, Baoding, Dingxian, Cangxian, Shimen, Hengshui, Xingtai, and Handan, and directly governs four cities: Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Qinhuangdao, and Baoding, one hundred and thirty-two counties, and ten towns directly under the special districts. There are more than 44,000 villages with a total population of 29.7 million. Hebei Province is an old revolutionary base area of the Chinese people, with a glorious tradition of long-term revolutionary struggle. After ten years of struggle under white terror, eight years of arduous War of Resistance Against Japan and three years of People's Liberation War, the number of Communist Party members has now grown to more than 810,000, accounting for 2.7% of the total population of the province. There are a total of 83,000 cadres above the district level who have been separated from production, most of whom have undergone the training and testing of revolutionary war and anti-feudal struggle. They are the main backbone of future production and construction. The province still retains a considerable number of local troops, public security teams, and hundreds of thousands of militiamen who have been tested in war. This is an important force for maintaining public security in the province, eliminating the remaining enemy forces, and ensuring that the people can carry out production. The vast masses of the province have been widely organized and mobilized in major historical tasks such as participating in the war, joining the army, supporting the front, land reform, and production. Especially after land reform in the new districts, the peasant masses have become unprecedentedly aware, and their great strength will be an important guarantee for future production and construction. The grassroots organizations of the people's democratic power in the province have been gradually transformed in the revolutionary war and mass movement, and have initially established a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. Hebei Province has fertile land and abundant products, with 99 million mu of arable land. Wheat and cotton are the main crops. This year, the wheat planting area reached 25.3 million mu, accounting for 25.5% of the total arable land, with an annual output of 1.125 million tons. According to statistics from the Central Hebei, Southern Hebei, and Eastern Hebei regions alone, the cotton planting area this year reached 8.82 million mu, and the cotton produced is sufficient to supply all the cotton spindles in North China with surplus. The yields of other crops such as peanuts and coarse grains are also abundant, and bristles and white oil are necessities for urban industry or valuable export products. The province is also rich in mineral resources, known for its coal production. In addition to the Kailuan and Jingxing coal mines, which are under the direct management of North China, there are also twelve coal mines such as the Dazhong mine in Shahe County, the Qiumingcun mine in Qiuxian County, the Qicun mine in Lincheng County, the Lingshan mine in Lingshan County, the Great Wall mine in Linyu, and the Huta mine in Wu'an County, with abundant output, which is an important foundation for the development of industry. In addition, non-ferrous gold mines are also important raw materials for light and heavy industries. Railways extend in all directions within the province, rivers crisscross, and highway networks connect major cities, which will play an important role in the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas in the future and prepare good conditions for the development of transportation and water conservancy. A total of about 34,300 villages in the province have undergone land reform, accounting for nearly 80% of the total number of villages, and the historical task of eliminating the feudal land system has been basically completed. In areas that have undergone land reform, the enthusiasm of farmers for production has been greatly improved, laying a good foundation for the further development of agriculture in the future. Hebei Province has always been known for its developed culture and education, leading the northern provinces. There are currently more than 140 middle schools and colleges, with more than 30,000 students, and more than 28,000 primary schools, with more than 2 million students, which is the main source of talent for various construction undertakings in the future. Hebei Province has transitioned from a war environment to an environment of production and construction. The reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, which is a concentrated manifestation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, has been completely destroyed. Both urban and rural areas have favorable conditions for restoring and developing various constructions. Under these conditions, it is necessary to restore and develop industrial and agricultural production step by step and with a considerable plan, earnestly implement the "facing all directions" policy, unify steps, concentrate forces, eliminate obstacles to the development of production, eliminate hidden bandits, and do everything possible to strive for the realization of the construction tasks of Hebei Province.

    新河北省介绍
    本报记者  陈迹
    七月二十八日华北人民政府第三次委员会扩大会议通过了关于变更华北行政区划及河北省人民政府组织与人事任命等重要决议。八月一日，河北省人民政府奉命正式成立了。这是中国人民伟大胜利的辉煌标志，值得我们欢欣鼓舞，热烈庆祝。
    在抗日战争及人民解放战争中，由于日寇及国民党匪帮的军事分割，中国人民为要胜利地打击敌人，河北省曾不得不打破旧省界，依自然形势及敌人分割情形，划分为冀中、冀南、冀东、北岳（一部）、太行（一部）等小的战略单位，这在当时战争形势下是完全必要的，对战胜敌人，起了极大作用。今天的形势已根本改变，分割的形势已不存在，河北省原建制的恢复，不但可能而且十分必要了。河北省地区广大，东至渤海，西倚太行，南迄大名、北靠长城，为华北与东北两大解放区联系的枢纽。旧河北省所辖县份中除东光、南皮、盐山、庆云、宁津、吴桥、南乐、清丰、濮阳、东明、长垣等十一县划归他省外，原冀中、冀南、冀东、太行各行署及察哈尔省所辖县份中，其原属旧河北省建制者，均划入新建河北省；原属冀南行署之旧山东省馆陶、临清、邱县、夏津、武城、恩县等六县，及原属太行行署之旧河南省武安、涉县、临漳等三县亦划归河北省；原冀南行署所辖冠县、莘县、高唐、永智、武训、元朝之朝城部分及平原等七县则划归他省。全省分唐山、天津、通县、保定、定县、沧县、石门、衡水、邢台、邯郸等十个专区，直辖唐山、石家庄、秦皇岛、保定四市，一百三十二个县及专区直辖的十个镇。四万四千多个村庄，共人口二千九百七十万。河北省是中国人民革命老根据地，具有长期的革命斗争的光荣传统，经过十年白色恐怖下的斗争，八年艰苦抗日战争及三年人民解放战争，共产党员现已发展到八十一万余，占全省总人口的百分之二点七，区以上脱离生产的干部共八万三千人，他们大都经过革命战争和反封建斗争的锻炼与考验的。是今后生产建设的主要骨干，全省仍保有经过战争考验相当数量的地方部队及公安队、民兵数十万。这是维护全省治安、消灭敌人残余势力和保障人民进行生产的重要力量。全省广大群众在参战、参军、支前、土改、生产等重大历史任务中，已经过广泛地组织与发动，除新区外特别是土改以后，农民群众已空前觉悟起来，雄伟的力量将是今后生产建设的重要保证。全省人民民主政权的基层组织，在革命战争及群众运动中，经过逐步改造，已初步确立了以工人阶级为领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。河北省土地肥沃物产丰富，可耕地九千九百万亩，农作盛产小麦及棉花。今年小麦种植面积达二千五百三十万亩，占总耕地百分之二十五点五，常年产量一百一十二万五千吨。棉花今年种植仅冀中、冀南、冀东三区统计，即达八百八十二万亩，所产棉量足供全华北纱锭尚有余。他如花生、粗粮等产量亦丰，猪鬃、白油等，均为城市工业必需品或出口珍品。矿藏亦较丰富，以产煤著称，除开滦与井陉煤矿属华北直辖管理外，尚有沙河县之大众，邱县之邱明村，临城县之祁村，灵山县之灵山，临榆之长城及武安县之胡塔等十二个煤矿，产量丰富，为发展工业的重要基础。此外有色金矿等，亦为轻重工业重要原料。境内铁路四达，河流纵横，公路网联紧了主要城市，对今后城乡物资交流将有重要作用，并为发展运输及水利事业准备了良好条件。全省经过土地改革的村庄共三万四千三百左右，占总村庄数百分之八十弱，消灭封建土地制度的历史任务已基本胜利完成。经过土改的地区，农民生产积极性已大为提高，为今后农业的进一步发展，打下了很好的基础。河北省文化教育素称发达，为北方各省之冠，现有中学及专科以上学校一百四十余座，学生三万余人，高初小学两万八千余座，学生二百余万人，这是今后各种建设事业人材产生的主要源泉。河北省已由战争进入生产建设的环境，帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三者所集中表现的国民党反动统治，已被彻底摧毁，无论城市与乡村，都具备了恢复与发展各种建设的有利条件。在这种条件下，必须有步骤并有相当计划的恢复与发展工农业生产，认真贯彻四面八方政策，在实现恢复与发展全省生产建设的总任务下，统一步调、集中力量，扫除发展生产的障碍，消灭隐蔽的匪敌，尽一切可能的力量，为实现河北省的建设任务而奋斗。
