Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th. According to TASS, Judge Medina of the US Federal Court in New York has repeatedly and illegally deprived witnesses for the defense of their legitimate right to testify in the trial of US Communist leaders. On August 1st, Mrs. Hall, a witness for the defense, described how she lectured on women's issues at a Communist training class. She said that she had told the students: "Black women in the United States are subjected to triple oppression: first, racial oppression suffered by blacks, second, oppression suffered by women, and third, oppression suffered by workers. I told them that the only way to achieve equality is to oppose the growing fascist atrocities." At this point, Judge Medina angrily prevented her from presenting evidence regarding fascist atrocities. On August 4th, Medina again forbade Mrs. Hall from explaining in court the content of the lectures given by several accused US Communist leaders in the Communist training class, even though the main "charge" against the US Communist leaders was that they used the training class to promote a "conspiracy" to overthrow the US government by violence. Prior to this, Medina had prohibited former University of Washington philosophy professor and Communist Party member Herbert Phillips from explaining how he taught Marxism-Leninism in Seattle in 1946. Under the instigation of the local reactionary authorities in Washington State, Phillips was dismissed by the school authorities at the beginning of this year.

    美非法“审讯”美共领袖
    又无理剥夺证人权利
    【新华社北平七日电】据塔斯社消息，美国纽约联邦法院法官麦迪纳最近在“审讯”美共领袖的法庭上，一再非法剥夺被告证人举证的正当权利。八月一日，被告证人贺尔夫人叙述她在共产党训练班里讲授妇女问题的情形。她说，她曾告诉学生：“美国黑人妇女受到三重压迫：第一是黑人所受的种族压迫，第二是妇女所受的压迫，第三是工人所受的压迫。我曾告诉他们，获得平等的唯一办法是反对增长中的法西斯暴行”。此时，法官麦迪纳忿忿地阻止了她提出关于法西斯暴行的举证。八月四日，麦迪纳又禁止贺尔夫人在法庭上说明几位被控的美共领袖在共产党训练班里讲课的内容，虽然法庭控告美共领袖的主要“罪名”，就是什么利用训练班宣传以暴力推翻美国政府的“阴谋”。在这以前，麦迪纳曾禁止前华盛顿大学哲学教授、共产党员赫尔伯·费利浦斯说明他一九四六年如何在西雅图讲授马列主义的情形。在华盛顿州地方反动当局的授意下，费利浦斯已于今年年初被学校当局解聘。
