    [Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station, 9th broadcast] In order to develop material exchanges between the liberated areas, support Greater Shanghai, and crush the blockade of imperialism and domestic reactionaries, the Northeast Export Company recently consulted with the Shanghai Military Control Commission Economic Takeover Committee on the issue of material exchange between the two regions, and an agreement has been reached. The Northeast Export Company will first ship 20,000 tons of rice, 10,000 tons of soybeans, and 30,000 cubic meters of timber to Shanghai to meet the city's needs for food and timber. The Shanghai Military Control Commission Economic Takeover Committee will provide some industrial products and other items needed by the Northeast in exchange. After receiving the grain shipment notice from the Northeast Export Company, the Northeast Dongxing Company arranged for allocation and loading.
