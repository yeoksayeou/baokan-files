　　All Sectors Unanimously Support Representatives' Meeting Resolutions
    Offering Suggestions for Implementation
  　Expedite Population Evacuation, Vigorously Practice Thrift and Economy
    [This City News] Workers, students, people's police, vendors, and citizens of Beijing have recently expressed their opinions on how to convey and implement the resolutions of the Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference.

    Wang Feng, a worker at Xinhua Rubber Company, said: First, there are still many people in Beijing who eat but do not work. They should be quickly evacuated to the countryside to farm and should no longer live in the city, consuming but not producing. Second, counter-revolutionary special agents are enemies of the people, and we must seriously eliminate them. This is a matter for the people themselves, and everyone must assist the government in reporting special agents. Third, regarding labor-capital disputes in private factories, I hope that all industries can quickly resolve them and sign collective contracts so that both labor and capital can better cooperate in production based on the contracts. Li Yuliang, an old worker at the Industrial Zhi Xing Society, said, "This conference's resolution to solve the problem of worker education is exactly what we need. I am still illiterate. I hope that more workers' night schools will be established so that we can have the opportunity to study, learn more knowledge, and serve the people more."

    Feng Changquan and Jin Yukai, car and road workers at the Tram Company, said that we all agree with the conference's resolution on developing production and promoting democratic management in factories. We must carry out production competitions to complete production tasks. Currently, the South Factory of the Tram Company already has four competition groups and one study group, and the North Factory already has one diligent labor group. Everyone is preparing to compete to win over passengers and reduce breakdowns. Regarding thrift and economy, they advocate starting with adjusting personnel and overcoming waste.

    Student Jin Junhui of Peking University said, "This meeting was very well held, but unfortunately, the publicity and education work among the masses is not yet in-depth enough. The students of Peking University are waiting for the representatives of the conference to quickly and thoroughly convey the information."

    Jin Xinghan, a police officer in the Inner Seventh District, said, "To implement the resolutions of the conference, we must first start with thrift and economy. Now our department has begun to save electricity. Previously, there were a total of seventeen or eighteen light bulbs, but now they have been reduced to eight or nine. If everyone does this, we can overcome difficulties and focus our efforts on construction."

    Hong Yanxu, a bookseller in the Dongdan People's Market, said, "In the future, Beijing's more than 40,000 vendors should be better organized to assist the government in its work, doing whatever they can." He suggested that the government carefully study and open up legitimate production businesses to enable vendors to change careers and build Beijing better.

    Li Changhai (an old gentleman of fifty-nine), a citizen of Xipi City in the Seventh District, after seeing the banner of the People's Representatives Conference hanging in front of Zhongshan Park, paid attention to reading the newspaper every day. He said, "Both streamlining and economy and evacuating the population must be done. The city should eliminate the atmosphere of corruption and extravagance, and idlers should be evacuated to the countryside to participate in production."

　　各界一致拥护代表会决议
    纷纷提供执行意见
  　赶快疏散人口厉行精简节约
    【本市讯】北平市工人、学生、人民警察、摊贩和市民近就如何传达和执行北平市各界代表会议的决议，纷纷发表意见。
    新华橡胶公司工人王锋说：一、现在北平吃饭不干活的人仍然很多，应该赶快疏散到乡村种地，不能再住在城里只消耗不生产。二、反革命特务是人民的敌人，我们要认真肃清它。这是人民自己的事，人人要协助政府检举特务。三、关于私营工厂的劳资纠纷，希望各行各业都能迅速解决，订立集体合同，以使劳资双方依据合同更好地协力生产。工业知行社老工人李玉梁说：“这次大会决议要解决工人教育问题，正合我们的要求。我还是个不识字的人，我希望多多地设立工人夜校，让我们有念书的机会，多学些知识，为人民更多地服务。”
    电车公司车路工人冯长泉、金玉铠说，我们都很赞成大会关于发展生产和开展工厂管理民主化问题的决议，我们要开展生产竞赛来完成生产任务。现在电车公司南厂已有四个竞赛小组，一个学习小组，北厂已有一个勤劳小组，大家准备竞赛争取乘客，减少故障。关于节约方面，他们主张从调整人事，克服浪费着手。
    北大金君晖同学说：“这个会开得很好，可惜的是在群众中的宣传与教育工作做得还不够深入，北大的同学正等着参加大会的代表迅速详细的传达。”
    内七区警士金兴汉说：“我们要执行大会决议，首先从节约作起，现在我们这一部分已开始节省电力，从前一共有十七、八个灯头，现在减成了八、九个。大家都这样做，就能够克服困难，把力量放在建设方面。”
    东单人民市场书贩洪延绪说：“今后北平四万多摊贩应更好地组织起来，大家协助政府办事，能做什么就做什么。”他提议政府缜密研究，开辟正当生产事业，使摊贩转业，把北平建设得更好。
    七区西皮市市民李长海（五十九岁的老先生），看到中山公园门前挂着各界代表会的标帜以后，便每天注意看报纸，他说：“精简节约，疏散人口两件事都要做，城市里应扫除腐化奢侈的风气，闲杂人口应疏散到农村里去参加生产”。
