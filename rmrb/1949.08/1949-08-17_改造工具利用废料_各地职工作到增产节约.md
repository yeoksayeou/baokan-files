Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 14th: The role of workers' creativity and thrift in overcoming production difficulties has recently become significantly apparent in various regions. Two important recent innovations at the Beiping 70th Ordnance Factory include: Firstly, young technician Wang Qian created a new tool for manufacturing percussion caps and reinforcing covers, greatly reducing the manufacturing process. At the same time, he manufactured an automatic ejection rubber valve to prevent finger injuries when manually removing finished products. Thanks to the use of the new tool, the manufacturing of reinforcing covers has been reduced from the past five steps to one, with each worker able to produce 12,000 reinforcing covers, compared to the previous need for sixteen workers. Another innovation is technician Li Hongda's creation of a specialized tool for disassembling and assembling the recoil mechanisms of Type 88 anti-aircraft guns, reducing the manual labor required by half and saving two-thirds of the time. Engineers and workers of the Electromechanical Group of the Mentougou Chengzi Coal Mine renovated two 50-horsepower oil switches more than a month ago. After the renovation, it used six fewer gates, six fewer gate assemblies, and one less oil tank, and also reduced the use of transformer oil by ten gallons; after more than a month of use, the effect has been good. Workers at the No. 1 papermaking workshop of the Shanghai Jiangnan Paper Mill added a roller between the felt and the drying cylinder to prevent the wet paper from breaking or curling in the middle, resulting in a reduction of paper loss by 30 to 40 percent. Utilizing scrap materials or self-made substitutes to overcome the current difficulties in materials has also achieved many results in many places. Shanghai No. 17 Textile Factory connected 15,700 jin of torn iron sheets from cotton bales in more than forty days, and continued to use them for packing. The Second Maintenance Depot of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company created a simple gasoline filter, so that the dirty gasoline used for washing parts can continue to be used, saving three gallons of gasoline every day. The generator of the Shandong Fangzi Coal Mine uses 60 jin of oil per day and night, but the actual consumption is only 20 jin, and the remaining 40 jin become waste oil and flow out along the waterway. The mine's technicians evaporated and refined these waste oils into pure oil for continued use, greatly saving on machine oil consumption. Because it was very difficult for the Jinan People's Paper Mill to purchase copper wire mesh for the paper machine, the workers repaired the old broken mesh and continued to use it, and the production was not affected. In July, the factory produced a total of 66,400 pounds of newsprint, exceeding the plan by 33 percent. The workers of the Boshan Xihe Coal Mine Electric Motor Factory manufactured calcium carbide. Due to the extreme shortage of carbon rods, the workers found the carbon rods that the Japanese invaders had tried to manufacture without success in the past, and after some processing, they successfully manufactured them. In addition to its own use, the calcium carbide produced by the mine is also supplied to Zichuan, Jiawang, Huainan, Zaozhuang and other mines. In order to ensure steel production, the workers of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company's steel pouring workshop took the initiative to collect and repair waste materials, which solved the difficulty of insufficient number of gate pipes and bricks, and successfully studied the use of coarse mud instead of white mud for connecting pipe bricks.

　　改造工具利用废料
  　各地职工作到增产节约
    【新华社北平十四日电】工人们在生产中的创造和节约对于克服生产困难所起的作用，最近在各地都显著地表现出来。北平七十兵工厂工人最近的两件重要创造：一是青年技工王谦创制了制造引火帽和加强罩的一种新工具，使制造过程大大缩减。同时他又制造了自动退活的橡皮瓣，以免用手取出成品时手指易受伤。由于使用了新工具，制造加强罩由过去的五个步骤缩减为一个，每工可以出加强罩一万二千个，在过去则需十六个工。另一创造是技工李宏达创制了拆装八八式高射炮复坐机的专门工具，使需用人工较过去减少一半，时间节省三分之二。门头沟城子煤矿机电组的工程师和工人，一个多月前改造了两个五十匹马力的油开关。经过改造后，较前少用了六个闸头、六个闸组、一个开油箱，还可少用十加仑变压器油；经使用一个多月，效果良好。上海江南造纸厂一号造纸厂工人在毛布到烘缸中间加一辘滚，以免湿纸中途折断或卷边，结果损纸较前减少百分之三十到四十。利用废料或自制代用品克服当前资材困难的办法，在许多地方也得到很多成绩。上海中纺十七厂曾在四十多天中接好棉花包上拆下来的片断铁皮一万五千七百斤，继续做打包之用。上海公共交通公司第二保养场创造了简便的汽油沪清器，使洗涤零件的龌龊汽油仍可继续利用，每天可节省汽油三加仑。山东坊子煤矿发电机一昼夜用油六十斤，但实际消耗只二十斤，其余四十斤都成废油随水道流出。该矿技师把这些废油蒸发提炼为纯油，继续使用，大大节省了机油消耗。济南人民造纸厂因购买抄纸机上的铜丝网很困难，工人们便修理了过去的破网继续应用，而且使生产不受影响。七月份该厂共出新闻纸六万六千四百磅，超过计划百分之三十三。博山西河煤矿电机厂制造电石，因炭精棒来源奇缺，工人们便把过去日寇曾试制未成功的炭精棒找出来，经过一番加工，制造成功。该矿所制电石，除自用外，还供给淄川、贾汪、淮南、枣庄等矿需用。上海钢铁公司浇钢场工人为了保证钢铁生产，曾主动收集修补废料，解决了浇口管子砖的数量不足的困难，并研究成功以粗＠泥代替白泥，作接管子砖之用。
