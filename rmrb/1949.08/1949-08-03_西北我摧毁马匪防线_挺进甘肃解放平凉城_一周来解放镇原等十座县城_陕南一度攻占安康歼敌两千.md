Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 2nd: The People's Liberation Army, advancing towards Gansu Province to pursue and annihilate the Ma bandit troops of Ningxia and Qinghai, liberated Pingliang County, an important stronghold on the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway in eastern Gansu, on the 28th, following the liberation of six counties including Longxian, Changwu, and Jingchuan. They also advanced into Anguosi and Xincheng, two strongholds northwest of Pingliang. Another PLA unit advancing towards Gansu Province from Longxian annihilated the majority of the enemy's 14th Brigade near the Xiguguan Pass in Longxian on the same day, capturing over 500 enemy soldiers below the rank of deputy brigade commander and seizing over 2,000 warhorses.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 2nd: The People's Liberation Army, pursuing Ma bandits westward from Longxian in western Shaanxi, crossed the Longshan Mountains on the border of Shaanxi and Gansu and liberated Qingshui County, northeast of Tianshui in Gansu Province, at 5:00 AM on July 31st. Another PLA unit advancing along the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway into Gansu Province liberated Zhenyuan and Chongxin counties, northeast and southeast of Pingliang, on the 29th. The defending enemies in both locations abandoned their cities and fled. Since the PLA launched its offensive against the two Ma bandit armies on the morning of July 25th, as of the morning of July 31st, in less than a week, they have successively recovered and liberated ten counties and vast villages and towns, including @ County, Longxian, Changwu, Lingshan in western Shaanxi, and Pingliang, Jingchuan, Qingshui, Ningxian, Chongxin, and Zhenyuan in eastern Gansu. The defense line constructed by Ma Bufang's bandit army of Qinghai and Ma Hongkui's bandit army of Ningxia, stretching from Pingliang in the north to Xiguguan Town and Guanshan Mountain in Longxian in the south, has been completely destroyed by the PLA. The two Ma bandit armies have either been annihilated or fled in panic. The PLA is now bravely pursuing the fleeing enemies. During this pursuit battle, the front-line units held gatherings to warmly celebrate the "August 1st" Army Day. The morale of all units is extremely high, vowing to completely annihilate the two Ma bandit armies and completely liberate the Great Northwest.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 2nd: The people of Pingliang in eastern Gansu warmly welcome the People's Liberation Army. When the PLA entered the city on the 30th of last month, welcome slogans of various colors were posted everywhere on the streets. People held welcome pennants and cheered along the streets, and representatives from all walks of life rushed to Ten Mile Shop in the east of the city to greet them. The Military Control Commission has now entered the city to work.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 2nd: The People's Liberation Army in southern Shaanxi launched an attack on Ankang City in the Han River basin on the 17th of last month. In the ten-day offensive up to the 26th, it annihilated more than 2,000 enemies and once occupied Ankang New City and the east, west, and south gates of the Old City. On the 17th, our army attacked places such as Shiziba and Dagui Ping west of Pingli City, repelling all of the Hu bandits' 98th Army, the 31st Division of the 27th Army, and the 254th Division of the 3rd Army that were entrenched there, and advanced to occupy positions such as Nuwa Mountain and Laoxian north of Pingli. Our army continued to pursue and successively crushed the resistance of the remaining Hu bandits' 69th Army, the 27th Army, and the 257th Division in places such as Niutiling and Goujiguan, once occupying Ankang New City and three gates of the Old City.
