　　A Casual Discussion of Nutritional Science
    Yang Sheng
    The issue of national nutrition occupies a considerably important position within the broader issue of national health. This means, what foods should the people of an entire country eat, and how should they eat them, in order to guarantee the health of the people and to enhance the soundness and happiness of the entire nation's physique.
    In our country, the rural population accounts for eight or nine tenths, while urban residents only account for one or two tenths. And among urban residents, middle and lower class families constitute the majority, with the wealthy being only a minority. Nutrition is essentially for the masses; for the minority of wealthy people, perhaps there is no nutritional problem at all. However, in the past, some people had such erroneous views and ideas, as if nutrition was only for landlords and the bourgeoisie. When the masses of people could not even get enough to eat, what were we talking about nutrition for! Yes, our first priority is to ensure that everyone has food to eat, as the saying goes, first seek to have clothing and food, then strive for abundant clothing and food. This has been initially achieved in our old liberated areas, and is being actively pursued in the newly liberated areas. Therefore, from the long-term interests of national health, we should pay attention to the issue of nutrition and urgently seek the popularization of nutritional knowledge.
    The meaning of nutrition, in other words, is to talk about "the scientification of eating." It means that we must learn how to choose foods that are inexpensive but contain rich nutrients. Many valuable nutrients (such as various vitamins) exist in very common foods, and it is not necessary to take American vitamin pills to obtain them. The important thing is that we must have some common sense in choosing food and understand some reasonable methods of utilization. If we know these, we can easily get enough nutrition from various foods. Learning these common senses is not difficult. We must now learn the "science of eating" to improve the nutrition of our masses.
    The diet of our people mainly relies on grains and beans, and animal-based foods are eaten very little. This is because our people have always had economic difficulties, especially in the past century, we have suffered from the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, resulting in a very backward state of our industrial and agricultural economy, and the suffering of the people is by no means accidental. When we cannot directly obtain sufficient food for the people from the plants on the ground, how can we raise more livestock! Therefore, the production quantity of our animal-based foods is extremely insufficient, especially dairy and meat. But in order to promote the long-term goal of improving the well-being of all our people, we must quickly build an industrialized agriculture, we must make full use of modern science and technology to increase the production of our crops. At the same time, we should also raise as many pigs, cattle, sheep, and chickens as possible. And use the produced milk, meat, and eggs to replace a portion of the grains. At the same time, we cannot ignore marine foods, we must try our best to increase production; and we should strive to study the processing and manufacturing of these many things to achieve the use of marine foods to supplement the shortage of land-based foods.
    In fact, our country's annual egg production is quite large. Eggs occupy a very important position in national nutrition, and we must actively promote the universal consumption of eggs. Eggs contain the richest vitamins A, B, D, etc., as well as high-quality protein. These are precisely the parts that our people's daily diet most lacks. According to Mr. Wu Xian's research, when the general people in the north mainly eat millet and sweet potatoes, they should add green vegetables and eggs. Therefore, vigorously promoting people raising chickens is one of the ways to increase national nutrition.
    Vegetables such as spinach, amaranth, green vegetables, and all green vegetables, as well as sweet potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, etc., are really all excellent foods. The vitamin A content in spinach is very high, sometimes it can be ten times higher than the butter bought on the market, which is something that many people cannot imagine. As for vitamin C, vegetables are definitely number one. This valuable nutrient is commonly found in vegetables, especially tomatoes, which are the most vitamin C-rich vegetables, and we should promote their universal cultivation. Various vegetables are also a source of many inorganic salts. Since Chinese people do not have milk in their diet, nutrients such as vegetables (especially green vegetables) that are inexpensive and of good quality should be used more.
    We should also use more beans. Among beans, soybeans are the most nutritious. Soybeans are not just one type, most of those produced in Northeast China are yellow, also known as yellow beans. There are also black and white ones, but their production is not as high as yellow beans. The nutritional value of soybeans does not have significant differences due to different colors. Fresh soybeans initially taken out of the pods are usually called edamame, or green soybeans. The difference between edamame and dry soybeans is: edamame has more water and contains starch, while dry soybeans do not contain starch; edamame contains vitamin C, while dry soybeans do not. But when dried beans are soaked in water and sprouted, such as mung beans and soybean sprouts, they contain very rich vitamin C. Bean products, such as tofu and fermented tofu, have been treated with added substances, and their composition has changed, and their nutritional value has also increased accordingly. Generally speaking, soybeans are superior to other beans in three aspects: First, the protein and fat contained in soybeans are not only rich in content but also of excellent quality. Second, soybeans contain four rich minerals: phosphorus, calcium, iron, and magnesium. Third, the vitamin content in soybeans is not less than other foods. For example, thiamine (vitamin B1), the content in soybeans is ten times higher than that of milk, and other various vitamin Bs are no less than milk, eggs, and pig liver. Fresh edamame contains 15% protein, and dry soybeans contain as high as 40%. Soybean protein contains all the essential amino acids, so it is a complete protein. Soybean protein is also easily utilized by the human body. According to many people's research, it is known that there is a mutual assistance function between soybean protein and grain protein. Therefore, we advocate that bean foods and their products should be universally used in the diet of Chinese people, so that the protein problem in people's nutrition can be quite satisfactorily solved under the existing economic conditions.
    As mentioned above, grains such as rice, wheat, millet, and sorghum are the main food of our humans. The outer skin and germ of grains are very rich in vitamin B and inorganic salts such as phosphorus and iron. However, because we do not understand the principles of nutrition, we often abandoned the essence of the grains in the past. From brown rice to white rice, from black bread to white bread, what a huge loss is this! Here, this important issue is explained and discussed again, hoping to arouse everyone's attention to improve these past wrong practices:
    Some are errors in food cooking. If food is cooked for too long and is too cooked, or the food is washed too thoroughly with water, these practices are enough to cause excessive loss of the rich nutrients in the food, especially vitamins A and C are most affected. Cooking vegetables in a copper pot is most likely to destroy the vitamin C in the food. If some alkali or baking soda is added when cooking vegetables and beans to keep the vegetables fresh and green, it is a big loss for you because these foods, through the action of alkali and heat, destroy the nutrients they contain, especially the precious vitamins.
    Some are errors in eating habits. For example, in North China, it is customary to first soak vegetables in boiling water, and when eating, only eat the vegetables, and the vegetable soup is discarded. This is really the most wrong way to eat. The vegetable soup contains a large amount of vitamins and inorganic salts, and it is a pity to discard it; vegetables should be washed with cold water, and after cooking, the vegetables and vegetable soup should be eaten at the same time, and no discard should be made. In some places, such as Sichuan, only the stems of the vegetables are eaten, and not the nutrient-rich leaves, which is also the most wrong way to eat, and we should correct it. When cooking rice, the rice soup is often taken to wash clothes, which is another serious waste of nutrients. Rice soup contains various nutrients that are easily digested, and we cannot arbitrarily discard these useful nutrients.
    There are also some errors in food storage. Fresh food will quickly lose its vitamins after being placed in the air for a long time, and if the temperature is too high, it will suffer even faster losses.
    In summary, these erroneous eating habits and practices are worth the attention of all our people. Because these nutritional knowledge seem to be very ordinary issues, but their importance in the issue of national nutrition should not be taken lightly.
    Soybeans, eggs, and green vegetables are three excellent foods that our people need to consume in large quantities and universally in terms of nutrition. We also advocate promoting the consumption of whole rice, whole wheat flour, and miscellaneous grains. In terms of cooking methods and eating habits, we must correct the errors. If all our people can do this seriously, then the improvement of our people's health will be inestimable.

　　漫谈营养科学
    杨胜
    国民营养问题在整个国民健康问题上是占着相当重要的地位。这就是说整个国家的人民应当吃些什么食物？怎么吃法？才能保证人民身体的健康，而增进整个国家民族体格之健全与幸福。
    我国人民，乡村人口占十分之八九，城市居民只占十分之一二。而城市里居民，又以中下等家庭占大多数，富裕的只是少数。营养本是为了大众的，对于少数的富裕者，也许根本没有营养的问题。但是，过去总有那么些人，有过这么错误的看法和想法，好象营养是专为地主、资产阶级们所讲的，对于人民大众，连饭也吃不饱的时候，我们还讲什么营养不营养呢！是的，我们首先是要做到大家有饭吃，所谓先求有衣有食，再谋丰衣足食。这些在我们老解放区里已经初步做到了，在新解放区里也正朝着这个方向努力前进。因之，我们从国民健康问题的长远利益上着想，应该重视营养问题，并且要迫切谋求营养知识的普及。
    营养的意义，换句话说，就是要讲“吃的科学化”。就是我们要学会怎样去选择那些价值低廉，而又含丰富营养素的食物。很多可宝贵的营养素（例如各种维生素等），就存在在极普通的食物里面，并不是一定要吃什么美国的维他命丸才可以供给的。重要的是在我们须具备一些选择食物的常识，和懂得一些合理利用的方法。能知道这些，我们就容易从各种食物里得到足够的营养了。这些常识学起并不难的。我们现在必须学会“吃的科学”，来改进我们人民大众的营养。
    我国人民的膳食，主要是靠谷类和豆类，动物类的食物是吃得很少的。这是因为我们人民一向在经济上有困难，尤其近百年来，我们受尽帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的压迫，造成我们工业农业经济上十分落后的状态，人民生活的困苦，决不是偶然的。当我们还不能从地面的植物，直接求得人们充足食物的时候，哪里还能多养家畜呢！所以，我们现在动物性食物的生产数量是极不够的，尤以乳类同肉类。但是为了增进我们全体人民生活幸福的远大目标，我们必须从速建设起工业化的农业，我们必须要尽量利用现代的科学技术，去增产我们的农作物。同时还尽可能的养猪、养牛、养羊与养鸡。而以其出产的乳、肉和蛋代替了一部分的谷类。同时，我们也不能忽视海产的食物，要尽量设法去增产；并应努力研究这许多东西的加工制造，达到利用海产食物补充地上食物之不足。
    其实，我国每年鸡蛋的产量，是相当多的。鸡蛋对国民的营养占着非常重要的地位，我们要积极提倡普遍的食用鸡蛋。鸡蛋里含有最丰富的维生素甲、乙、丁等，还有上好的蛋白质。这些，正是我们人民平日膳食中最感缺乏的部分。根据吴宪先生的研究，在北方一般人民以小米白薯为主食时，应加青菜同鸡蛋，因此，必须大力推广人民养鸡是增加国民营养办法之一。
    蔬菜里的菠菜、苋菜、青菜等一切绿色的蔬菜，以及白薯、胡萝卜、西红柿等，实在都是上好的食物。菠菜里的维生素甲含量很高，有的时候可以比市上买的黄油（俗称白脱）高出十倍，这是很多人所想不到的。至于维生素丙，那是只有推蔬菜第一了，蔬菜里普遍的存在着这种宝贵的营养素，尤其是西红柿（番茄）就是最富维生素丙的蔬菜，我们应该提倡普遍的栽种。各种蔬菜还是许多无机盐分的供给品。国人膳食中是没有牛乳的，所以，象蔬菜（特别是绿色蔬菜）这一类价廉物美的营养品，更应该多用。
    我们也应该多用豆类，豆类中滋养最好的，首推大豆。大豆不只一种，我国东北出产的大都是黄色，也称为黄豆。此外也有黑色的、白色的，其产量均不如黄豆多。大豆的营养价值，并不因颜色的不同而有显著的差异。新鲜的大豆初由荚中取出，通常就称为毛豆，或称青豆。毛豆和干的大豆不同的地方：是毛豆的水分较多，含有淀粉，而干的大豆则不含淀粉；毛豆含有维生素丙，而干的大豆则没有。但当干燥的豆浸水发芽后，如绿豆、黄豆芽等，则又含很丰富的维生素丙了。豆类的制品，如豆腐，发酶豆腐等，都经过外加物质的处置，其成份已有改变，其营养价值也因之而增高了。总起来说，大豆较其他豆类优异的地方有三方面：第一、大豆里所含的蛋白质同脂肪，不但含量丰富，而且品质优良。第二、大豆里含有磷、钙、铁、镁等四种丰富的矿质。第三、大豆里的维生素含量不比其他食物少。比如讲硫胺素（维生素乙一）吧，大豆里的含量比牛奶要大十倍，其他各种维生素乙，比牛奶、鸡蛋、猪肝都不逊色。新鲜的毛豆，含百分之十五的蛋白质，干的大豆含量则高至百分之四十。大豆蛋白质含着所有必需的氨基酸，所以是一种完全的蛋白质。大豆蛋白质也很容易被人体所利用。根据很多人的研究，知道大豆蛋白质与谷类蛋白质间，有一种互相辅助的功用。所以，我们主张国人的膳食中应该要普遍的应用豆类食物及其制品，则人民营养中蛋白质问题，在现有经济状况下，便可以得到相当完满的解决。
    象上面所说过的，谷类如米、麦、小米、高粱等，都是我们人类的主要食物。谷类的外皮与胚，是极富维生素乙及磷、铁等无机盐分的部分。然而，我们因为不了解营养原理，过去常常是把谷粒的精华部分都舍弃了。从糙米变为白米，从黑面包变为白面包，这其间的损失真是何等的浩大！这里再把这个重要的问题，来加以说明与讨论，希望能促起大家的注意，以改进过去这些错误的作法：
    有一些是食物烹调上的错误。如食物烹煮得太久，太熟，食物经水洗得太透，这些作法，都足以使食物中丰富的营养素损失过多，尤其是维生素甲、丙最受影响。用铜的锅子煮菜，最能破坏食物中的维生素丙。假若在煮蔬菜和豆类时，放上一些碱或苏打，想保持一下菜的新鲜绿色；可是这却对你大大的不上算了，因为这些食物经碱同热的作用，把它们含有的营养素给破坏了，尤其是宝贵的维生素。
    有一些是吃法上的错误。譬如在华北各地，都习惯将蔬菜先用沸水浸煮，吃的时候，只吃菜，而菜汤就不要了。这实在是最错误的吃法了。菜汤里边是含有大量的维生素同无机盐分，弃之实在可惜；蔬菜应该用冷水洗，煮熟后，菜与菜汤应同时食用，不能有丝毫抛弃。有的地方，象四川一带，吃蔬菜时只吃菜的茎部，而不吃营养丰富的叶部，这也是一种最错误的吃法，我们应该要加以改正。煮米饭时候，米汤常拿去洗衣服用，这又是何等严重的糟塌养料，米汤里边含有各种很容易被消化的营养素，我们不能把这些有用的养料，随意抛弃。
    还有一些是食物储藏方面的错误。新鲜的食物在空气中经过长时间的放置，就会很快地失去含有的维生素，假若温度过高，则会遭到更快的损失。
    总起来说，上面这些错误的吃法与作法，都值得我们全体人民的注意。因为，这些有关营养的知识，看起来是很平常的问题，但在国民营养问题的重要性上是不可等闲视之的。
    大豆、鸡蛋、青菜是我们人民营养上极需要大量普遍食用的三种优秀的食物。我们也同时主张提倡食用粗米粗面同杂粮。在烹调方法上，吃的习惯上，要把错误的地方改正。假若我们全体人民能如此认真去做的话，那对于我们人民健康的增进，将是无法估计的事情。
