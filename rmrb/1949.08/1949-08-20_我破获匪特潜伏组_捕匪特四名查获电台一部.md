　　We Cracked a Bandit Special Agent Infiltration Group
　　Arrested Four Bandit Special Agents, and Seized a Radio Transmitter
　　[This City News] A Kuomintang pseudo-Ministry of National Defense Pacification General Headquarters' infiltration group radio station, which was潜伏 in this city plotting to disrupt the revolutionary order, has been cracked by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Last November, when the People's Liberation Army besieged Peiping, Xu Liang, the special agent leader of the Pseudo-Ministry of National Defense Pacification General Headquarters Telecommunications General Station, secretly instructed Wang Yugeng, a military intelligence agent, to establish the Peiping District Radio Station First Branch Station, issuing a two-way radio transmitter and three codebooks. Guo Shuchun, the infiltration group leader of the Pseudo-Pacification General Headquarters First Brigade, provided intelligence, directly contacting the Pseudo-Ministry of National Defense Second Department. After the liberation of Peiping, although the Municipal Public Security Bureau repeatedly announced that special agents and reactionary parties should register, the criminals refused to register and persisted in their evil ways. In June of this year, they dared to develop Zhang Jinkun, former Management Section Chief of the Pseudo-Jiaojing General Bureau Jinzhou Railway Bureau Police Department, and Chang Bingyan, former Police Group Leader of the Pseudo-Jinxi Station, as group members, plotting to carry out sabotage activities. After the Municipal Public Security Bureau detected this, it went to No. 20 Wangpi Hutong, No. 38 Xijiaomincang, and other places on the 5th of this month, together with the Outer Second Branch Bureau, arrested the above four criminals, and seized radio transmitters, codebooks, and other items.

　　我破获匪特潜伏组
  　捕匪特四名查获电台一部
    【本市讯】潜伏本市阴谋破坏革命秩序的国民党伪国防部绥靖总队潜伏组电台，已为市公安局破获。去年十一月解放军围攻北平时，伪国防部绥靖总队电讯总台特务头子许良，曾秘密布置军统特务王虞庚，成立北平区电台第一分台，发给收发两用电台一部，密码三本，由伪绥靖总队第一大队潜伏组长郭书纯供给情报，直接与伪国防部二厅联络。北平解放后，市公安局虽一再布告特务分子及反动党派进行登记，但该犯等均拒绝登记，且怙恶不悛，竟敢于本年六月间，发展前伪交警总局锦州铁路局警务处管理科长张金昆、前伪锦西站警察组长常丙炎为组员，阴谋进行破坏活动。市公安局侦悉后，即于本月五日，会同外二分局前往王皮胡同二十号，西交民苍三十八号等地，将上述四犯捕获，并搜出电台、密码本等物。
