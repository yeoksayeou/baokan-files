　　East China Military Region and Nanjing-based Troops
    Discuss Production and Thrift
  　Current Focus on Thrift, Production as Secondary
    [Nanjing News] The East China Military Region, the directly subordinate units of the Third Field Army, and various organs and troops stationed in Nanjing, under the leadership of the Front Committee and the Nanjing Municipal Committee, have formed a "Production and Thrift Committee." Recently, they held their first meeting to discuss specific methods and plans for production and thrift. More than 20 representatives from the Military Region and the Third Field Army Headquarters, Political Department, Logistics Department, Military and Political University, and Garrison Command attended, presided over by Comrade Zhong Qiguang, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Military Region and the Third Field Army. The representatives successively exchanged preliminary views on plans and methods for practicing production and thrift, unanimously agreeing that it should begin with ideological education, starting with thrift and running supply cooperatives and small-scale sideline production. They should learn from the experiences and lessons of past production and thrift campaigns to achieve results and support the front lines. The meeting also criticized some incorrect views on thrift, such as: "Corruption is illegal, wasting a little doesn't matter," and "The public cares more about money than things, damaging public property is no big deal," and other erroneous ideas. It was proposed to strengthen the mass concept, the labor concept, and the idea of building a new China. In his final speech, Deputy Director Zhong pointed out that in today's situation, where "the war to liberate all of China must be supported, the imperialists' blockade conspiracies against us must be shattered, the floods and droughts in the old and new liberated areas must be rescued, and the country's financial difficulties must be faced squarely," there is no doubt that the production and thrift movement must be implemented. Everyone, from top to bottom, must share hardships and difficulties. Deputy Director Zhong said: "In order to achieve practical results from the movement, the responsible comrades of the units present today, including myself, must also set an example, take the lead in reducing our living standards. This kind of exemplary action is a strong factor in promoting the movement." On the issue of thrift, Deputy Director Zhong pointed out that the principle of cadres being more important than soldiers and organs being more important than troops must be established. Thrift must never be applied to the minimum living supplies of soldiers in the company; the daily 28 ounces of rice, five mace of oil, five mace of salt, and one catty of vegetables (the current vegetable money is only enough to buy one catty of vegetables) must be maintained. He said: In the initial stage, production and thrift should focus on thrift, with production as secondary. At the same time, thrift and reorganization are inseparable; we must follow the decisions of the Reorganization Committee and implement them vigorously. Regarding the direction of production, the organs and troops stationed in the cities, because they have to adapt to the small amount of open space in Jiangnan and the current lack of foundation for production, will focus not on industry or agriculture, but on sideline production and small cooperatives, but will not abandon agricultural production that can be carried out.

　　华东军区暨驻宁各部队
    讨论生产节约
  　目前以作好节约为主生产为副
    【南京讯】华东军区暨第三野战军直属队及驻宁各机关部队在前委和宁市委领导下组成“生产节约委员会”，最近并召开首次会议，研讨生产节约的具体办法与计划。到军区暨三野司令部、政治部、后勤部、军政大学及警备司令部代表二十余人，由军区暨三野政治部副主任钟期光同志主持。各代表相继对厉行生产节约的计划办法，初步交换了意见，一致认为首先应从思想教育开始，以节约及办供应合作社、小型副业生产着手，接受过去历次生产节约运动的经验教训，做出成绩，支援前线。会议并批判了某些对节约的不正确的看法：如认为：“贪污是犯法的，浪费一点无所谓”，“公家重钱不重物，破坏点公物不关紧”等等错误思想。提出应当加强群众观念、劳动观念与建设新中国的思想。钟副主任最后发言，他指出：在“解放全中国的战争必须支援，帝国主义者对我们的封锁阴谋必须粉碎，新老解放区各地的水旱风灾必须抢救，国家财政困难必须正视”的今天，对生产节约运动是无疑问的必须贯彻执行。要上下都能共艰苦，同患难。钟副主任说：“为了要取得运动的实效，今天到会的各单位的负责同志，连我本人在内，还得以身作则，首先起模范作用，自动降低生活水平，这种模范行动，才是推进运动的强烈因素。”在节约问题上，钟副主任指出：要确定干部重于战士，机关重于部队的原则。节约万万不可节到连队战士的最低生活供给上去，每天二十八两米，五钱油，五钱盐，一斤菜（现在菜金仅够买一斤菜）是要维持的。他说：生产节约在目前初期应以节约为主，生产为副。同时节约与整编是分不开的，我们要遵照整编委员会的决定，雷厉风行的做。关于生产的方向，住在城市的机关部队，因为要适应江南空地少与目前生产尚无基础的情况，不是工业，也不是农业，而是副业生产与小型合作社，但也不放弃可以进行的农业生产。
