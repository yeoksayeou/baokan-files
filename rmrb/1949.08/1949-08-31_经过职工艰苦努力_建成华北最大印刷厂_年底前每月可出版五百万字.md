　　Through the Hard Work of Employees, the Largest Printing Factory in North China is Built; Monthly Publication of Five Million Characters Possible Before the End of the Year

　　The Beiping Xinhua Printing Factory, under the leadership of the Publications Committee, was built by taking over the Zhengzhong Printing Factory of the Kuomintang reactionaries. This factory was originally the largest letterpress printing factory in North China established by the Japanese invaders in Beiping. However, it was set on fire and destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit troops before we liberated Beiping. The main factory building—a large building, including the entire offset printing department, the entire typesetting department, and the main warehouses—was completely destroyed. None of the remaining machines were complete. However, through the hard work of the workers and the takeover staff, it has now reached a considerable production scale of typesetting four million characters and printing three thousand reams of paper per month. It is expected that before the end of this year, it can be increased to a production capacity of five million characters and four thousand five hundred reams of paper per month, becoming the largest letterpress printing factory in North China.

　　After we took over this factory, the workers demonstrated amazing efforts in the restoration work and production work, demonstrating a new work style and a new labor attitude. For example, during the restoration work, in the cold early spring weather, the workers voluntarily went down into the water wells to retrieve rubber cylinders, climbed up the fire-damaged dangerous walls to remove glass, and even fell and were injured. They converted unusable vertical milling machines into horizontal milling machines. In recent months, the machine printing group and the binding group have voluntarily worked overtime for two hours per shift, which has continued for two weeks. The copper mold group workers voluntarily did voluntary work on Sundays to take care of the electroplating tanks, and the rubber pouring workers voluntarily did voluntary work on Sundays without asking the factory to praise them, fully demonstrating the working attitude of the working class as masters of their own affairs.

　　According to comrades in charge of the Publications Committee, efforts will be made to publish books related to economic construction in the future, so that cultural construction will be closely integrated with economic construction. A large number of national periodicals will also be published. Due to the leadership of the Party and the development of the situation, the business of the Committee and the Xinhua Bookstore is developing rapidly. Although the financial difficulties and the difficulties of cadres are great, they can and will inevitably be overcome.

　　The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Party has decided to convene a national publishing work conference of Xinhua Bookstores in late September. The Publications Committee is carrying out various preparations. This conference will mainly discuss the unification of Xinhua Bookstores nationwide. It can be asserted that after the completion of this unification work, the national state-owned publishing industry will form a strong whole and exert its strength many times over.

　　经过职工艰苦努力
    建成华北最大印刷厂
    年底前每月可出版五百万字
    出版委员会领导的北平新华印刷厂，是接管了国民党反动派的正中印刷厂建设起来的。这厂原先是日寇在北平建立的华北最大的一个铅印工厂，但在我解放北平前被国民党匪军纵火焚毁，主要的厂房——一座大楼，包括全部胶版印刷部，全部排字部，主要的仓库完全毁了；劫余的机器，也没有一架完整的了。但是经过工人和接管工作人员的艰苦努力，现在又已达到每月排字四百万，印纸三千令的相当大的生产规模。预计今年年底以前，可提高到每月五百万字和四千五百令纸的生产力，成为华北最大的一个铅印工厂。
    这工厂在我们接管以后，工人们在恢复工作中和生产工作中表现了惊人的努力，表现了新的工作作风和新的劳动态度。如恢复工作时期，在寒冷的初春天气，工友自动地下水井捞取胶筒，爬上火烧过的危墙取下玻璃以至堕地负伤，将不能用的立铣铣床改造成平铣铣床；在近月来机印股和装钉股每班自动加工两小时，已继续了两个星期之久。铜模股工友自动做星期义务工照顾电缸，倒胶工友自动做星期义务工并不要厂方表扬等等，完全表现出工人阶级主人翁的工作态度。
    据出版委员会负责同志谈，今后将努力出版有关经济建设的书籍，使文化建设密切与经济建设结合起来；并将大量出版全国性的各种定期刊物。由于党的领导与形势发展，该会与新华书店的业务，在日新月异地发展中，财政情况的困难与干部的困难虽然很大，但这是可以克服也必然会被克服的。
    党中央宣传部决定在九月下旬召开全国新华书店的出版工作会议，出版委员会方面正在进行各项准备工作，这个会议将主要讨论全国新华书店的统一问题。可以断言，这个统一工作完成以后，全国公营出版事业，将形成强有力的一个整体，加倍地发挥出力量来。
