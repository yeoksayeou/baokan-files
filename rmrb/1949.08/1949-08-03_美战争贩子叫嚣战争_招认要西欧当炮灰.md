Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 2nd -- TASS, Washington: U.S. Army Chief of Staff Bradley, while testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on July 29 regarding the "Military Assistance Program," delivered an undisguised aggressive speech. He outlined the strategic plan of the Atlantic military alliance in the event of war, saying: America's task will be to carry out strategic bombing and drop atomic bombs; the U.S. Navy will join the navies of the Western European alliance to carry out basic naval operations and keep sea lanes open. At the same time, Bradley emphasized that the "core" of the existing ground forces will come from Europe and be "assisted" by other countries. In other words, Western European countries are designated to serve as cannon fodder. Bradley finally acknowledged the "hesitation" of Western European countries and condemned the "fear" and "selfishness" of the ruling groups in these countries. However, it is doubtful whether Bradley's "explanation" of the role played by Western European countries can eliminate this "hesitation." After Bradley's speech, the Foreign Affairs Committee voted to ask reporters and the public to leave the meeting to discuss military plans in a closed-door session.

    美战争贩子叫嚣战争
    招认要西欧当炮灰
    【新华社北平二日电】塔斯社华盛顿讯：美陆军参谋长布莱德雷在七月二十九日众院外委会为“军事援助计划”作证时，发表露骨的侵略性讲演。他慨述一旦发生战争时大西洋军事联盟的战略计划说：美国的任务将是实行战略轰炸与投掷原子炸弹，美国海军将与西欧联盟的海军一道执行基本的海军行动，并保持海上航线通行无阻。同时，布莱德雷强调称：现有地上部队的“核心”将来自欧洲，并由他国予以“援助”。换句话说，西欧国家被指定充当炮灰。布莱德雷最后承认西欧国家的“犹豫不决”，并谴责这些国家统治集团的“恐惧”与“利己主义”。但是，布莱德雷关于西欧国家所充当的角色的“解释”，能否消灭这种“犹豫不决”是很值得怀疑的。布莱德雷发言之后，外委会表决请记者与公众退席，在秘密会议上讨论军事计划。
