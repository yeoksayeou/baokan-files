    Nanjing People's Bank Loans Over Ten Million
    Farmers on Bagua Island Purchase Diesel to Reclaim Land
    [Nanjing Third Dispatch] According to investigation and research, the Nanjing People's Bank decided on the 27th of last month to loan RMB 14,200,070 to the farmers' cooperative production committees of the first and second reclamation areas of Bagua Island. This will assist local farmers to purchase diesel and vigorously reclaim more than 30,000 mu of fertile land in the area that was submerged by the river. Staff members of the bank's cooperative section, in coordination with cadres from the Xiaolingwei District, have also begun establishing a vegetable supply and marketing cooperative to prevent intermediate exploitation in the exchange of Xiaolingwei's main agricultural products and urban goods. At the same time, in order to solve the fertilizer shortage, a fertilizer supply and marketing cooperative will soon be established.
