Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, August 15th. The Beiping Guangming Daily, a newspaper of the Democratic League, today published a conversation with Shao Lizhi, former ambassador to the Soviet Union of the Kuomintang government, regarding Sino-Soviet relations during the Anti-Japanese War. Shao Lizhi said: "From the beginning of China's War of Resistance Against Japan, the Soviet Union concluded a non-aggression treaty with China, providing loans and weapons to aid China, and for a long time contained nearly one million Kwantung Army troops. Even in the spring of 1941, when Hitler had already decided to invade the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union, for strategic reasons, concluded a neutrality treaty with Japan, but the Japanese Kwantung Army did not dare to transfer its troops to attack China as a result. At that time, I was serving as ambassador to the Soviet Union, and I saw through the role of its treaty with Japan, so I reported to Chongqing that the Soviet-Japanese treaty would not hinder China's War of Resistance and Sino-Soviet friendship." Shao Lizhi emphasized that the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to Northeast China in August 1945 played a decisive role in defeating Japanese fascism, and the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was completely reasonable and fully in line with Sun Yat-sen's proposals. He said: "Before the Soviet Union entered the war, although Japan had suffered defeats on islands in the sea, all of the elite Kwantung Army had not suffered any damage. Without destroying the Kwantung Army, even if the Japanese invaders were defeated on their main island, they could still come to our Northeast continent to fight. The Soviet Union's war against Japan was so smooth, and it took less than a week to wipe out the elite Kwantung Army of the Japanese invaders. This was because the strength of the Soviet Red Army was so powerful, thus prompting the unconditional surrender of the Japanese invaders. As for the various conditions set in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, which were later known to be based on the Yalta Agreement, in my view, they were really necessary to prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression and to ensure peace after the war, and I did not feel that the Soviet Union gained much advantage. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries at the time were unwilling to do so." Shao Lizhi recalled the past, saying: "In the spring of 1943, I made proposals regarding Sino-Soviet relations, the most important of which was that China should propose to the Soviet Union to conclude a treaty similar to the Soviet-Czechoslovak military alliance treaty. Regarding many issues between China and the Soviet Union that needed to be resolved, my proposals were almost similar to those contained in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. Because at that time, I believed that these issues must be rationally resolved, especially recognizing the independence of Outer Mongolia, which was completely in line with the spirit of Sun Yat-sen's nation-building program of supporting small and weak nations to achieve autonomy and self-determination. Unfortunately, my proposals at the time were not adopted or valued at all." When discussing the Kuomintang reactionaries' slander of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, Shao Lizhi said indignantly: "They insisted that this was a treaty that betrayed the country and forfeited its sovereignty, but they did not know that they themselves were traitors to Sun Yat-sen." He said: "Domestic reactionaries and international imperialists have been constantly spreading rumors, distorting facts, and trying to undermine the pure friendship between China and the Soviet Union, which has reached its climax with the recent publication of the White Paper by the U.S. State Department. But the tricks of reversing black and white cannot cover up the people's discerning eyes. The friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is deepening and developing day by day. Taking the August 15th Northeast Liberation Anniversary as an example, and looking at the vigorous construction undertakings in the Northeast, the brotherly Sino-Soviet relationship can never be undermined by a few slanderous words in the American White Paper."

　　邵力子谈抗日时期中苏关系
    签订友好同盟条约完全合理苏联出兵东北决定日寇投降
    【新华社北平十五日电】民主同盟机关报北平光明日报今日刊载前国民党政府驻苏大使邵力子关于对日战争时期中苏关系的谈话。邵力子说：“苏联从中国抗战开始的时候，就与中国缔结了互不侵犯协定，以贷款和武器援助中国，并且长期地牵制了将近一百万的关东军。就是一九四一年春间希特勒已决心进犯苏联的时候，苏联为了战略关系，与日本订立了中立条约，日本关东军也并不因此而敢于调开来打中国。我那时正出使苏联，我看透了它与日本缔约的作用，所以曾经报告重庆，苏日条约决不会妨碍中国抗战和中苏友谊。”邵力子强调指出，一九四五年八月苏联出兵东北对打败日本法西斯有决定作用，中苏友好同盟条约是完全合理的，完全符合孙中山先生的主张。他说：“在苏联参战以前，日本虽然在海中岛屿上遭受到失败，但是，所有精粹的关东军还没有受到一点损伤。不消灭关东军，日寇即使在它本岛战败，还可以到我们东北大陆上来作战的。苏联对日作战所以顺利，出兵不足一个星期，便歼灭了日寇精锐的关东军，这是因为苏联红军的力量实在强大，因此，促成了日寇无条件投降。至于中苏友好同盟所定各项条件，后来知道是根据雅尔达协定的，在我看起来，为防制日本侵略势力复活，保障战后和平，是实在需要的，并不觉得苏联得了多少便宜。但是，当时的国民党反动派是不愿意这样做的。”邵力子追述往事说：“我在一九四三年春间，曾提出有关中苏邦交的建议，最重要的是中国应向苏联提议订立与苏捷军事同盟条约一样的条约。关于中苏之间的许多应解决的问题，我所建议的几乎多与中苏友好协定所包含的相类似。因为那时我认为这些问题必须加以合理的解决，尤其是承认外蒙古的独立，和中山先生建国大纲所定扶助弱小民族使之自治自决的精神，完全符合。不幸，我当时的建议完全没有被采用或重视。”在论及国民党反动派对于中苏友好同盟条约的诬蔑时，邵力子愤慨地说：“他们硬说这是丧权辱国的条约，殊不知他们自己正是做了中山先生的叛徒。”他说：“国内反动派和国际帝国主义者不断地散布谣言，颠倒事实，想破坏中苏之间的纯洁友谊，到了美国国务院最近发表的白皮书，可说是到了顶点。但是颠倒黑白的伎俩，终究掩不住人民雪亮的眼睛。中苏两国人民的友情，一天一天的深固而发展。就八月十五日东北解放纪念这一个日子来讲，再就东北蓬勃生长的建设事业来看，兄弟一般的中苏关系决不是美国白皮书里几句诬蔑的话所能挑拨的。”
