The Post Office Box
Q&A from the Post Office Service Group

    Recently, some readers have inquired about issues related to renting post office boxes. We are pleased to provide answers from the Public Service Group of the Beiping Post Office:
    If an organization, group, business, or individual has a large volume of incoming and outgoing mail, does not want to publicize their address, or does not want the hassle of receiving mail, they can rent a “post office box” from the post office to receive mail.
    “Post office boxes” come in four different sizes, with different rental fees. The first size is 6 inches in length and width, with a semi-annual rental fee of 1,000 yuan. The second size is 6 inches in length and 12 inches in width, with a semi-annual rental fee of 2,000 yuan. The third size is 12 inches in length and width, with a semi-annual rental fee of 3,000 yuan. The fourth size is 14 inches in length and 18 inches in width, with a semi-annual rental fee of 4,000 yuan. The key deposit is 1,500 yuan (this key deposit will be refunded when the keys are returned to the post office in good condition at the end of the rental period). The Beiping Post and Telecommunications Administration and the 6th Branch Office on West Chang'an Street in this city both have these "post office boxes," but the Beiping Post and Telecommunications Administration only has the second size, while the West Chang'an Street Post Office has all four sizes. After the renter properly fills out the box rental application and pays the rental fee and key deposit as required, the post office will provide one or more keys. The renter can go to the post office at any time to collect mail. The matters that the renter should pay attention to are listed as follows:
    1. The renter should print the rented box number on the envelope and all documents and notify all friends or organizations with whom they communicate to write it on the envelope.
    2. Ordinary mail sent to the renter's box is placed in the box by the post office upon arrival. For registered mail, express mail, insured mail, and packages, only a blank receipt or notification slip is placed in the box. The renter can take the slip (after stamping it) to the relevant department to collect the item.
    3. Mail forwarded by the renter must indicate the box number, otherwise the post office will deliver it to the address written on the envelope.

    邮政专用信箱
    邮局服务组答问
    近有读者询及邮政专用信箱之租用诸问题，承北平邮局公众服务组解答如下：
    机关、团体、商号或个人，如果因为对外来往的信件很多，不愿意发表自己的住址，或者不愿有接收邮件的麻烦，可租用邮局的“专用信箱”收受邮件。
    “邮政专用信箱”计有尺寸大小不同的四种，租金各不相同，第一号长宽各六英寸，半年租金一千元，第二号长六英寸宽十二英寸，半年租金二千元；第三号长宽各十二英寸，半年租金三千元；第四号长十四英寸宽十八英寸，半年租金四千元。钥匙保证金一千五百元（此项钥匙保证金，于租期届满，将钥匙完好交回邮局时，即予退还）。本市北平邮政管理局及西长安街第六支局都设有这种“邮政专用信箱”，惟北平邮政管理局只有第二号一种、西长安街邮局四种全有。租用人妥填租箱申请书并照章缴纳租金和钥匙保证金后，由邮局给予钥匙一柄或数柄，租箱人可随时到局开取邮件。租箱人应当注意的事项，分列如后：
    一、租箱人应将所租信箱号数印在信封和一切单据上，并自行通知各处有通信关系的友人或机关照写在邮件封皮上。
    二、寄交租箱人的普通邮件，系于寄到时由邮局放置箱内，至挂号邮件，快递邮件，保价邮件和包裹等，则只把空白收据或通知单放在箱内，租箱人开取时，可持该项单据（盖章后）到相关部分领取。
    三、寄由租箱人转交的邮件，均须注明信箱号数，邮局方给放入箱内，否则即按封面所书地址投递。
