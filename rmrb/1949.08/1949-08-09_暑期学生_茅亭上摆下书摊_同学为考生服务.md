    Summer Students
    Book Stalls Set Up in Pavilions
    Students Serve Examinees
    ▲ In order to broadly promote the reading craze, the Arts and Sciences Section of the Northwest District of the School has set up book stalls in various pavilions, with various newspapers, magazines, and theoretical pamphlets. Students are constantly reading them throughout the day. Because there are many books here, and they can study and discuss with their friends, the environment is cool, and they feel more comfortable than in the large library.
    ▲ In order to encourage active physical exercise, the Northwest District of the School issued prizes to the winning teams in ball game competitions. The prizes were mirrors, inlaid with the words "For Labor, For the Construction of the Motherland" and "Exercise for the People." The winning volleyball and basketball champions were Furen Girls' Middle School, Men's Third Middle School, Pingmin Middle School, and Wusan Middle School.

    ▲ The Peiping Management Institute of Jiaotong University and Tangshan Institute of Technology are enrolling students in Peiping. Registration starts today (9th). The students who are staying at school during the summer vacation are actively organizing an examinee service corps. They will serve the examinees, help them with registration procedures, take care of bicycles, provide tea, and maintain order during the examination. They will also publish big-character posters during the examination period to disseminate information about the examination at any time, and plan to provide answers to the test questions.

    暑期学生
    茅亭上摆下书摊
    同学为考生服务
    ▲为了广泛展开阅读热潮，学园西北区学艺股在各茅亭上设立书摊，有各种报纸杂志和各种理论小册子，往阅同学们整日不断。因为这里书籍多，又可以和伙伴们一块学习和讨论，环境凉快，觉得比在大图书馆里还舒服。
    ▲为了鼓励积极锻炼身体，学园西北区发给球类赛获胜队奖品。奖品是镜子，内镶“为了劳动，为了祖国的建设”“锻炼身体为人民服务”等字样。得奖的排篮球冠军为辅仁女中、男三中、平民中学、五三中学等校。

    ▲中国交通大学北平管理学院、唐山工学院在平招生。由今（九）日开始报名，该院暑期留校同学正积极组织考生服务团。为考生服务，帮助考生办理报名手续，保管自行车、供应茶水，维持考试时的秩序等事项。并将于考试期间出版大字报，随时传布有关考试的报告。并拟作试题解答。
