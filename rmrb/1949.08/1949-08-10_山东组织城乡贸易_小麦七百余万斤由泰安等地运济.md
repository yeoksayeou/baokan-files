    Shandong Organizes Urban-Rural Trade
    Over Seven Million Jin of Wheat Shipped from Tai'an and Other Areas to Jinan
    [Jinan News] In order to regulate market supplies, Jinan Grain Company is vigorously organizing urban-rural material exchange. Recently, the Shandong Provincial Trade Corporation allocated a large amount of grain. The first batch of 7.5 million jin of wheat will be shipped from Tai'an, Bohai Cangnan, and Boxing areas. The grain has begun to arrive in the city successively. As a result, prices in Jinan are still tending to be stable. Because of the low price of wheat at the source, it is returning to normal. Tianjin merchants are buying less, and depositors are competing to sell. Furthermore, due to the profitability of peddlers selling wheat and buying back sorghum and corn, the transaction price has slightly fallen.

    山东组织城乡贸易
    小麦七百余万斤由泰安等地运济
    【济南讯】济市粮食公司为调剂市场物资，大力的组织城乡物资交流，于日前由山东省贸易总公司调拨大量粮食，现首批小麦七百五十万斤，将由泰安、渤海沧南、博兴三个地区运来。现粮食已开始陆续运抵本市。因之济市物价仍趋平疲状态。小麦因源地价低，步入正常，津商购少，存户争售，并因小贩售出小麦购回高粱、玉米有利，致成交价即稍落。
