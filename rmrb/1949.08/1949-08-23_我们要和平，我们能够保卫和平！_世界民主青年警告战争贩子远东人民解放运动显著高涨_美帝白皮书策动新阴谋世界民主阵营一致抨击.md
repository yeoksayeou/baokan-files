　　We Want Peace, We Can Defend Peace!
  　World Democratic Youth Warn War Mongers; People's Liberation Movement in the Far East Rises Significantly
    U.S. Imperialist White Paper Plots New Conspiracy; World Democratic Camp Unanimously Condemns
    “Defend Peace, Down with War Mongers,” “Long Live the Friendship and Cooperation of Young Workers, Young Farmers, and Students” – The World Youth and Student Festival opened on the 14th in Budapest, Hungary, under these slogans. Ten thousand youth representatives from eighty-five countries participated in the conference. This conference, a review of the world's youth and student forces for defending peace and democracy, has received the attention and support of people around the world. At the opening ceremony, half a million people crowded inside and outside the venue, cheering and singing along with the 10,000 representatives from various countries. World Federation of Democratic Youth President, Buaisson, pointed out in his opening speech: We want peace, we can defend peace. Let those who plan new wars know that democratic youth around the world are prepared to sacrifice their lives to defend peace, freedom, and national independence. Xiao Hua, the acting head of the Chinese Democratic Youth Delegation, stated in his address to the conference that the victory of the Chinese people demonstrates that the people of the world have the power and confidence to defeat imperialism. Congratulatory messages poured in from all corners of the world. The youth of the Greek Democratic Army, who are fighting against royalist fascists, assured the conference that they would continue their struggle until final victory. The first few days of the conference included exhibitions, sports, and art competitions, and Budapest was immersed in festivities every day. The names of Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Rákosi have become common languages at the venue. Youths from various countries expressed their love for their leaders and mentors by cheering these common names, expressing the will of democratic youth for international unity.
    The founding conference of the World Federation of Trade Unions' Trade Department for Educational Workers, held in Warsaw from the 12th to the 16th, has concluded successfully. This conference was the fourth meeting of the Trade Union Federation of Educational Workers since the war, and also the first meeting of the International Trade Department for Educational Workers of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The conference discussed two special reports: on the 13th, the report by Chinese representative Yang Jigao on "Cooperation between Teachers and the Working Class in the Struggle for Peace and Democracy," and on the 15th, the report by the Czechoslovak representative on "Educating Children and Youth in a Democratic Spirit." The conference adopted the charter and elected the presidium at the closing session. Soviet representative Brova called on the participating teachers to endorse the work of the World Peace Congress and actively participate in the establishment of a permanent peace committee and its ongoing work.
    In its reply to the Yugoslav government's note on August 11th, the Soviet government once again exposed the Tito clique's duplicitous tactics towards the Soviet Union and tore off the Tito clique's mask of pretending to be "friends" of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries. The Soviet reply pointed out that as early as April 1947, the Tito clique was plotting to sell out the Slovene Galician region in the issue of territorial claims against Austria, and was doing its utmost to collude with Western countries. The Tito clique also secretly held talks with Britain behind the Soviet Union's back, reaching a secret agreement to sacrifice the interests of the Galician Slovene people. This behavior violated its alliance obligations to the Soviet Union. The Soviet reply pointed out that the Tito clique's wanton slander of the Soviet Union in its note to the Soviet Union was a weapon picked from the fascist arsenal to cater to the will of the imperialist bloc. The Soviet reply concluded: "Let the people of Yugoslavia know that the Soviet government does not regard the current Yugoslav government as a friend and ally, but as an enemy and opponent of the Soviet Union." After the Soviet government's reply was released, democratic and progressive newspapers around the world expressed enthusiastic support and published editorials criticizing the Tito clique's heinous crimes. The Tito clique, with a guilty conscience, banned newspapers from publishing the Soviet government's reply and attempted to intensify its reign of terror against the Yugoslav people. Meanwhile, according to a TASS report citing Greek newspapers, the Tito clique, in order to further lean on the imperialist bloc, has had its chargé d'affaires in Athens discuss "issues related to the changed relations between the two countries" with the royalist fascist Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Italian Communist Party's newspaper, Unità, pointed out that Tito is gradually weaving his web of conspiracy behind the backs of the Greek people, and the Athens royalist fascist army is attacking the Democratic Army through Yugoslav territory. The Tito clique has completely degenerated into becoming an imperialist bloc hound dog in the Balkans.
    Philippine puppet President Quirino, who was summoned by Truman to the United States to discuss the formation of a "Pacific Alliance," returned to Manila on the 18th. Although Quirino's activities in the United States received Truman's guarantee that he would not return empty-handed, even U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, Cowen, expressed doubt about the value of this guarantee. After a series of puppet activities by Quirino, Chiang Kai-shek, and Syngman Rhee, U.S. imperialism is now plotting to help the Kuomintang in its death throes through Japan. Wu Tiecheng, one of the Kuomintang bandits, visited Japan and held two secret talks with MacArthur. At the same time, the Kuomintang mission in Japan publicly announced on the 18th that a large number of former Japanese soldiers and air force personnel "requested" the opportunity to go to China and fight alongside the Kuomintang. This news is clearly related to Wu Tiecheng's trip to Japan to request MacArthur to implement the plan to recruit 100,000 Japanese troops to help in the war as soon as possible. This crazy treasonous plot of the Kuomintang remnants to collude with the United States and the Japanese bandits will further arouse the indignation of all patriotic Chinese people. The Chinese people are vigilantly watching this development.
    After the publication of the U.S. White Paper on China, U.S. imperialism's policy of encouraging the overthrow of the people's new China has aroused angry condemnation from the entire Chinese and world democratic camps. Representatives of various Chinese democratic parties and people's organizations have issued comments, calling on the entire Chinese people to heighten their vigilance, unite, and smash the U.S. imperialists' vicious plot to sow discord among the Chinese people. Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: The White Paper shows that after the collapse of the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek government, the U.S. government will encourage other evil forces to undermine the people's regime in China. "Let me tell you - U.S. imperialists, your plan is bound to fail. The Chinese people's strength has grown to this day. Will it still be a problem to deal with the imperialists' tricks and conspiracies? However, we must heighten our vigilance, and we must respond to the imperialists' tricks and conspiracies with action." The Soviet newspaper Pravda published an article commenting that the White Paper proves that U.S. politicians have not learned anything from their thorough beating in their China policy. Acheson said that he will continue to support the Chinese reactionaries in the future, which means that new failures are waiting for U.S. imperialists in China. The Polish Warsaw newspaper commented that the great Chinese revolution is on the eve of victory, and the last struggles of Chiang Kai-shek, Jessup, and Vandenberg will be of no practical use. The U.S. Sunday Worker said that the White Paper is the Truman administration's new plan to sabotage the Chinese People's Government; as far as the U.S. imperialists are concerned, all of China has been lost. The British Daily Worker pointed out that the White Paper is a new declaration of war by the U.S. government against the Chinese people. If the U.S. government or the British government adopts a policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, that will be their own disaster. The French newspaper L'Humanité said that the White Paper has been forced to admit the failure of U.S. imperialism in China. The victory of the Chinese people is a failure for imperialism and U.S. colonial policy.
    In recent weeks, the movements of people in various parts of the Far East to fight for freedom, seek liberation, and uphold peace have seen a significant upsurge. On the 17th, the fourth anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Indonesia, 50,000 residents of Batavia, disregarding the ban of the Dutch occupation authorities, held the largest demonstration in four years, shouting slogans for freedom. Mass demonstrations also took place in Java, Sumatra, Sulawesi, and other places. At the same time, Indonesian guerrillas continued to fight fiercely, and the troops attacking Solo have occupied some parts of the city. The Dutch Communist newspaper, De Waarheid, pointed out that the scale of the national liberation struggle is expanding, and the Indonesian people will never recognize any secret agreement between the Netherlands and the Hatta group. The Indonesian people are increasingly aware of the harm that the Sukarno-Hatta group is doing to the people, and only by relying on the strength of the democratic front can they achieve freedom. The formation of the United Front of Burmese Patriotic Guerrillas and the establishment of the Joint Command of the People's Democratic Allied Forces have brought significant success to the Burmese people's struggle against the British puppet, Ba Swe. According to the London Daily Worker, the joint administrative organization controls an area of approximately 50,000 square miles west of the Yangon-Mandalay railway. Workers' strike movements are on the rise throughout India. Despite the Nehru government's arrests and bloody suppression, the strike of transportation workers in Delhi continued until the 18th, and 7,000 workers at the Kanpur Ordnance Factory went on strike. The 15th was the second anniversary of the declaration of so-called "independence" in India. Mass demonstrations were held in Kolkata, Madras, and other places, demanding genuine independence. Previously, 188 political prisoners in Vellore Prison conducted a heroic hunger strike to protest the authorities' abuse and persecution. At the same time, the movement of Indian people to uphold peace has also been launched. The All-India Trade Union Congress will host a conference to uphold peace in Kolkata in September. TASS reported on the 19th that a mass rally to uphold peace held in Firozabad passed a resolution saying: "If the imperialists attempt to turn India into a military base for attacking the Soviet Union, they will be met with resolute resistance from the Indian people."

　　我们要和平，我们能够保卫和平！
  　世界民主青年警告战争贩子远东人民解放运动显著高涨
    美帝白皮书策动新阴谋世界民主阵营一致抨击
    “保卫和平，打倒战争贩子”，“青年工人、青年农民和学生的友谊与合作万岁”——世界青年与学生联欢大会在这样的口号下十四日在匈京布达佩斯开幕了。参加大会的有八十五国青年的代表一万人。这一检阅世界青年、学生保卫和平民主力量的大会，受到全世界人民的注意和拥护，在开幕典礼上，会场内外拥挤着五十万群众，他们与参加大会的一万名各国代表同声欢呼高歌。世界民主青联主席鲍埃逊在开幕词中指出：我们要和平，我们能够保卫和平，让那些计划新战争的人知道，全世界民主青年已准备牺牲他们的生命来保卫和平、自由和民族独立。中国民主青年代表团代团长萧华在向大会致辞中用中国人民胜利的事实说明全世界人民有力量、有信心战胜帝国主义。致大会的贺电从全世界各个角落里飞来，正在对保皇法西斯作战的希腊民主军青年，向大会保证继续奋斗到最后胜利为止。大会的最初几天举行展览会及体育和艺术表演竞赛，布达佩斯每日浸沉在狂欢里。斯大林、毛泽东、拉科西的名字已成为会场上的共同语言，各国的青年用欢呼这共同的名字来表示对他们的领袖和导师的热爱，表示民主青年国际团结的意志。
    十二日到十六日在华沙举行的世界工联教育工作者职工部成立大会，已经胜利闭幕。本届会议是教育工作者职工会联合会战后第四次会议，同时是世界工联国际教育工作者职工部的首次会议。会上讨论了两个专题报告，即十三日中国代表杨继高关于“教师与工人阶级在争取和平民主斗争中的合作”报告，及十五日捷克斯洛伐克代表关于“以民主精神教育儿童和青年”报告。大会于闭幕会上通过了章程和选出了主席团。苏联代表布罗娃在会上号召与会教师认可世界和平大会的工作，并积极参加建立和平常设委员会及其经常工作。
    苏联政府于八月十一日再度致南斯拉夫政府照会的复文，揭发了铁托集团对苏联玩弄两面手腕的诡计和拆穿了铁托集团伪装为苏联和新民主主义国家的“朋友”的假面具。苏联的复文指明了铁托集团早在一九四七年四月就在对奥领土要求问题上进行着出卖斯洛文族加林西亚的计划，竭力与西方国家勾搭。铁托集团还背着苏联而与英国秘密会谈，谈妥了牺牲加林西亚斯洛文族人民利益的密约。这种行为违反了对苏的同盟义务。苏联的复文指出：铁托集团在致苏联照会中对苏联的恣意诬蔑，乃是迎合帝国主义集团意志的从法西斯武库捡来的武器。苏联的复文最后指出：“让南斯拉夫人民知道，苏联政府并不把南斯拉夫现政府当作朋友和同盟者，而是把它当作苏联的敌人和反对者。”苏联政府复文发布后，全世界民主及进步报界一致表示热烈的拥护，并刊载社论纷纷抨击铁托集团的丑恶罪行。而做贼心虚的铁托集团则禁止报纸登载苏联政府复文，并企图加紧对南斯拉夫人民的恐怖行为。同时据塔斯社引希腊报纸消息，铁托集团为进一步投靠帝国主义集团，已由其驻雅典代办与保皇法西斯外交部讨论“有关两国间业已改变了的关系问题”。意共团结报指出，铁托正背着希腊人民逐步编织他的阴谋网，雅典保皇法西斯军正通过南斯拉夫领土进攻民主军。铁托集团已经完全堕落到成为帝国主义集团在巴尔干的鹰犬了。
    应杜鲁门之召赴美商讨组织“太平洋联盟”的菲律宾傀儡总统季里诺，已于十八日返抵马尼拉。季里诺在美国的活动，虽然得到了杜鲁门不会空手而回的保证，可是这种保证究有多少价值，连美国驻菲大使柯温也表示怀疑。经过季里诺、蒋介石、李承晚的一连串的傀儡活动后，现在美帝国主义正布置着通过日本来帮助国民党进行垂死挣扎的阴谋。访问日本的国民党匪首之一吴铁城与麦克阿瑟进行了两次密谈。同时，国民党驻日使团于十八日公然宣布：大批前日本士兵与空军人员“请求”有机会到中国和国民党一起作战。这个消息显然与吴匪铁城这次去日本要求麦克阿瑟尽速实行招募十万日军来华助战的计划有关。国民党残匪这种疯狂的勾结美国与日寇的卖国阴谋，将更加激起一切有爱国心的中国人民的愤慨，中国人民正警惕地注视着这一发展。
    美国对华白皮书发表后，美国帝国主义鼓励推翻人民新中国的对华政策，引起了全中国和全世界民主阵营愤怒抨击。中国各民主党派各人民团体的代表人物纷纷发表评论，号召全中国人民提高警惕，团结起来，击破美国帝国主义对中国人民进行挑拨离间的恶毒阴谋。中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深说：白皮书说明，在蒋介石反动政府垮台以后，美国政府还要鼓励其他恶势力来破坏中国的人民政权。“告诉你——美国帝国主义者，你这种打算必然还是失败的，中国人民力量强大到了今天，对付帝国主义者这些诡计阴谋，还会成问题吗？不过，我们还要提高警觉性，我们要用行动来答复帝国主义者的诡计和阴谋。”苏联真理报刊载论文评称：白皮书证明，美国的政客们在对华政策上虽然挨了一顿饱打，却什么也没有学到。艾奇逊说，他今后还要支持中国反动派，这意味着在中国，新的失败又在等着美国帝国主义者。波兰华沙报评称：伟大的中国革命正处在胜利的前夕，蒋介石、耶塞普和范登堡的最后挣扎将是没有什么实际用处的。美国星期日工人报说：白皮书是杜鲁门政府破坏中国人民政府的新计划；对于美国帝国主义者说来，全中国均已丧失。英国工人日报指出：白皮书是美国政府对中国人民的新的战争宣言，美国政府或英国政府如果采取与中国人民为敌的方针，那将是它们自己的灾祸。法国人道报说：白皮书已被迫承认美国帝国主义在中国的失败。中国人民的胜利，对于帝国主义和美国的殖民政策就是失败。
    近周来，远东各地人民争自由、求解放、拥护和平的运动有着显著的高涨。在十七日印尼共和国宣布成立四周年纪念日，巴达维亚居民五万人，不顾荷兰占领当局禁令，举行了四年来最大的游行示威，高呼要自由的口号。爪哇、苏门答腊、西里伯斯等地也有群众示威。同时，印尼游击队仍继续奋战，进攻梭罗的部队已占领该城若干部分。荷共真理报指出，民族解放斗争的规模日益扩大，印尼人民决不承认荷兰与哈达集团的任何密约。印尼人民愈来愈了解到苏加诺——哈达集团对人民的危害，只有依靠民主战线的力量才能获得自由。缅甸爱国游击队联合阵线的组成与人民民主联军联合指挥部的成立使缅甸人民反对英国傀儡达钦努的斗争获得显著的成功，据伦敦工人日报报道，联合行政机构控制了仰光——曼德勒铁路以西约五万方哩的地区。印度各地工人罢工运动高涨。不顾尼赫鲁政府的逮捕与血腥镇压，德里市运输工人的罢工迄十八日为止仍在继续中，堪蒲尔兵工厂七千工人罢工。十五日为宣布印度所谓“独立”两周年纪念日，加尔各答、马德拉斯等地均有群众示威，要求真正的独立。前此，维罗尔监狱政治犯一百八十八人曾进行英勇的绝食斗争，抗议当局虐打及迫害。与此同时，印度人民拥护和平的运动也已展开，全印职工大会主持之拥护和平大会将于九月间在加尔各答召开。塔斯社十九日报道，在弗鲁查巴德地方举行的拥护和平群众大会通过决议说：“如果帝国主义者企图使印度变成进攻苏联的军事基地的话，他们就会遭到印度人民的坚决反击。”【新华社北平二十二日电】
