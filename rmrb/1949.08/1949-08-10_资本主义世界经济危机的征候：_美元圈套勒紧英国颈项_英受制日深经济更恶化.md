Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th: Moscow dispatch: The Red Navy newspaper recently published an article by Gan entitled "The Pressure of American Monopoly Capital on Marshallized Britain," stating that the first symptoms of the impending economic crisis in the capitalist world are vividly manifested in the imperialist contradictions between the United States and Britain, which are futilely attempting to conceal these contradictions with "cooperation" and "Atlantic solidarity."

In recent weeks, Britain's economic situation has deteriorated sharply. The dollar trap is tightening around Britain's neck, and the latter is becoming increasingly dependent on the United States. Britain's trade deficit with the dollar area is also increasing. The Marshall Plan has become a tool for American monopoly capital to squeeze British goods out of the European market and ensure the extensive entry of American goods into all parts of the British Empire. The United States, using the Marshall Plan, has effectively prohibited Britain from trading with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, thereby reducing Britain's trade possibilities. The economic crisis descending upon the United States has further increased Britain's already chronic dollar shortage. The devaluation of the pound has been put on the agenda.

British newspapers are forced to admit that the Marshall Plan has not helped to overcome economic difficulties in the slightest, and American loans have not helped to restore British industry. Most of the dollars are being used for the purposes of foreign policy, which Churchill handed over to the submissive right-wing Labor leaders, who are stubborn and unyielding. American monopoly capitalists are taking advantage of the position that Britain has fallen into due to the policies of the Labor leaders, and imposing their conditions on Britain, which have the clear goal of further weakening Britain and increasing its dependence on the United States. To this end, the United States is imposing various obstacles to prevent Britain from using dollars to buy wheat in Canada. Then, it attempted to obstruct Britain's trade agreement with Argentina, and forced Britain to "clear" accounts with other Marshall Plan countries, in order to accelerate the depletion of Britain's dollar and gold reserves.

Britain's attempt to stop the further depletion of gold and dollars by cutting purchases in the dollar area will inevitably lead to a reduction in the import of raw materials, which will result in a reduction in industrial production, the closure of businesses, and increased unemployment. Britain is trying to ease the dollar's oppression, but this attempt has aroused anger across the Atlantic, where they are threatening to stop Marshall Plan "aid" and make new demands on Britain. These demands include direct interference in Britain's internal affairs and making Britain's domestic policies subject to the interests of American monopoly capital.

The author concludes: Further reducing workers' wages, extending working hours, expanding exploitation, and creating an army of unemployed - this is the method of American monopoly capital, which the right-wing Labor leaders have gladly accepted.

    资本主义世界经济危机的征候：
    美元圈套勒紧英国颈项
    英受制日深经济更恶化
    【新华社北平九日电】莫斯科讯：红海军报顷刊载甘氏题为“美国垄断资本对马歇尔化英国的压力”的专文称：迫临资本主义世界的经济危机的第一批征候，逼真地表现在美英之间的帝国主义矛盾上，它们正徒劳无益地企图用“合作”及“大西洋的团结”，来掩盖这些矛盾。
    近数周来，英国的经济情况已急剧恶化。美元的圈套正勒紧英国的颈项，后者正越来越依附于美国。英国与美元区的贸易赤字也在增加。马歇尔计划成了美国垄断资本从欧洲市场上排挤英货及保证美货广泛进入英帝国各地的工具。美国利用马歇尔计划，实际上禁止英国与苏联及人民民主国家进行贸易，从而缩小了英国贸易的可能性。降临美国的经济危机，更其增加了英国已成为慢性的美元荒。英镑贬值问题已提上了日程。
    英国报纸被迫承认，马歇尔计划对于克服经济困难没有丝毫帮助，美国的贷款无助于恢复英国的工业。大部分美元都被用在由邱吉尔交给驯服的右翼工党领袖们固执不易的外交政策的用途上。美国垄断资本家利用英国因工党领袖的政策而陷入的地位，把他们的条件强加于英国，这些条件有着明显的目标，即更加削弱英国和增加它对美国的依赖。为了这一目的，美国施行各种阻碍，使英国不得用美元在加拿大购买小麦。然后，又企图阻挠英国与阿根廷的贸易协定，并强使英国“清算”与其他马歇尔计划国家的帐项，以加速英国美元与黄金储备的耗竭。
    英国企图以削减在美元区的购买来阻止黄金与美元的进一步耗竭，这无可避免地将使原料的入口减少，其结果，将削减工业生产，使企业关门，失业增加。英国企图和缓一下美元的压抑，但是，这种企图已引起大西洋彼岸的愤怒，那里威胁着要停止马歇尔计划的“援助”，并向英国提出新要求。这些要求包括直接干涉英国内政及使英国的内政政策服从于美国垄断资本利益。
    作者结语称：进一步削减工人工资，延长工作日，扩大剥削及制造失业军，这就是右翼工党领袖所欣然接受的美国垄断资本的办法。
