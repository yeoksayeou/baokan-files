What Kind of Medicine is in the "White Paper"?
	Will Not Fall into the Imperialist Trap Again
	Wang Tieyai
The U.S. government's publication of the so-called "United States Relations with China," a white paper of over a thousand pages, completely exposes the true face of imperialist aggression policies.

The facts are too obvious, and the Chinese people know them clearly. In the past, perhaps some people were misled by the imperialists' distortion of the facts and still had some illusions about the United States, or because they were too soft-hearted, they did not understand the insidious nature of the imperialist countries' posturing. Therefore, when the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek was beyond salvation, the U.S. government came up with new tricks, calling these people "democratic individualists," wanting to drive them to be the fifth column of New China and use them as new tools of aggression to continue to implement the consistent policy of U.S. imperialism. However, the U.S. government is too stupid; perhaps the nature of imperialism makes it unable to understand that in the fresh air of the Chinese people's liberation, no one will fall into the imperialist trap again. Those who still possessed so-called "liberalism" have, except for willingly being running dogs of imperialism, successively joined the democratic anti-imperialist and anti-aggression camp. To be honest, the white paper also finally shattered all illusions about U.S. imperialism and eliminated the confusion caused by deception. In the past, people did not understand the truth of Marshall's so-called "mediation," but now doesn't the white paper clearly state that his purpose was to consolidate the reactionary regime of Chiang Kai-shek? In the past, people did not understand the various activities of Stuart, but now doesn't the white paper describe his conspiracy plans? The white paper also frankly admits that the U.S. government has always intended to carry out large-scale military intervention, but it was only because the situation did not permit it that it dared not try...

　　“白皮书”装的什么药？
  　不会再落入帝国主义的圈套了
    王铁崖
    美国政府发表了所谓“中美关系”一千多页的白皮书，完全暴露了帝国主义侵略政策的真面目。
    事实是太明显了，中国人民都知道清楚的。过去也许还有些人因受帝国主义者歪曲事实的迷惑，对于美国还存某种幻想，或者因为心肠太软，对于装腔作势的做法还不了解其帝国主义国家的阴毒性。因此，美国政府在蒋介石反动政府无可挽救的时候想出新花样，把这些人叫做“民主的个人主义者”，想驱使他们做新中国的第五纵队，利用他们做侵略的新工具，来继续贯彻美帝国主义的一贯政策。但是，美国政府是太愚蠢了；也许是帝国主义的本质使它不能了解，在中国人民解放的新鲜空气之中，任何人都不会再落入帝国主义的圈套。过去还具所谓“自由主义思想”的人们，除了甘心为帝国主义的走狗之外，都相继参加了民主的反帝反侵略的阵营。老实说，白皮书还最后打破了一切对于美帝国主义的幻想，扫除因欺骗而发生的迷惑。过去不了解马歇尔所谓“调处”的真相，现在白皮书不是已经明白说出他的目的在于巩固蒋介石反动政权吗？过去不了解司徒雷登的种种活动，现在白皮书不是已经叙述他的阴谋计划吗？白皮书还坦白承认，美国政府自始至终一直有意实行大规模军事干涉，实在为形势所不许可，才不敢尝试……。
