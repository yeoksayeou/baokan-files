　　Five Unlawful Deserters
    Sentenced to Imprisonment
    [Reported by this newspaper] Qin Guanzhong, Shen Luying, Liu Zhi, and two others, five KMT deserters who impersonated a Chinese Communist Party organization in February of this year in an attempt to extort money and disrupt public order, have recently been tried and sentenced by the People's Court of Beiping Municipality. Qin Guanzhong, originally from Luoling, Sichuan, once served as a military police officer in the puppet 19th Regiment. He masterminded the gathering of deserters and vagrants, falsely establishing the "Shichao News Agency" in the name of impersonating the leader of the "Fourth Group of the Pingjin Action Team of the Underground Headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party." He also forged official seals, stamps, and certificates, attempting to "take over" bureaucratic capitalist industries and extort money from merchants and civilians. He was sentenced to ten years imprisonment. Shen Luying, from Guizhou Province, participated in Qin Guanzhong's various plans and served as the "Action Section Chief" of the "Action Team" and as a reporter for the "Shichao News Agency." While in prison, he was released on bail due to illness, and then repeatedly defrauded people of 4,000 People's Yuan in cash, multiple items of clothing, and 13,000 Yuan by defrauding them of money to buy a bicycle, all in the name of the detention center. He was sentenced to seven years imprisonment. Liu Zhi, from Guizhou Province, was Qin Guanzhong's main assistant, serving as the "Head of the Internal Affairs Section," participating in various plans, and proofreading "Instructions," "Secret Orders," and "Certificates," etc. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment. Feng Guojun, from Guizhou Province, and He Ming, from Sichuan Province, colluded with Qin Guanzhong and served as "Internal Affairs Section Members," each sentenced to one and a half years imprisonment. Gu Jinfu, from Shanghai, blindly participated in the fake organization and was sentenced to half a year imprisonment. (Guang)
