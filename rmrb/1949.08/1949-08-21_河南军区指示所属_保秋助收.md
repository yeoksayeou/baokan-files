　　Henan Military Region Instructs Subordinates
  　Protect Autumn Harvest and Assist in Collection
    [Kaifeng News] As the autumn harvest approaches, the Political Department of the Henan Military Region specifically issued instructions on the first of this month regarding protecting and assisting in the autumn harvest. The instructions first require all organs and troops in the region to clearly recognize that protecting the autumn harvest and assisting in the autumn harvest is a major task for mobilizing the masses to suppress bandits and oppose local bullies, and ensuring military supplies and people's food. All troops in the region must actively suppress bandits and protect the autumn harvest. All organs and troops should conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda to make the masses aware of the importance of the autumn harvest, and actively complete the autumn harvest in the gaps between suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, and supporting the front. The instructions stipulate: All organs and local troops must not use civilian labor during the autumn harvest period, and even when it is absolutely necessary, they should use as little as possible. During the autumn harvest period, all organs and troops (including bandit suppression troops, especially stationed troops) must appropriately organize manpower and animal power, divide areas, and extract a certain amount of time each day to help with the autumn harvest, first helping the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, basic masses lacking labor, and families of laborers or revolutionary workers lacking labor due to supporting the front or participating in revolutionary work. In assisting the harvest, we must earnestly and conscientiously treat the affairs of the masses as our own, and cut cleanly, pick cleanly, and thresh cleanly, without eating, smoking, or asking for rewards. Bandit suppression troops should combine the protection of the autumn harvest and assistance in collection with propaganda and investigation to understand the bandit situation, and combine bandit suppression, protection of the autumn harvest, and assistance in collection.
