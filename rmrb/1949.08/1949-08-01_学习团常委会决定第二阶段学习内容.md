    [This City News] The students of the summer learning group for middle school and university students, after summarizing their revolutionary outlook on life, learning attitudes, and methods, are about to enter the second phase of their study. Yesterday (the 31st), the Standing Committee held a meeting to discuss the content of the study and decided to focus on student work and the work of the Communist Youth League. From the 1st to the 6th, the main focus will be on studying the direction of student work and the nature, tasks, and work of the Communist Youth League, with the aim of resolving the questions of what to study, how to study, and organization. From the 8th to the 11th, the specific content of student work and Youth League work in schools during the previous semester will be reviewed, with a focus on learning attitudes, restoring learning order (overcoming lax and disorderly phenomena), student welfare (evaluation of scholarships and relief funds, etc.), especially the relationship between the League and the masses. The Summer Learning Group Committee of the New Democratic Youth League believes that the students have made great progress in the past two weeks of study, and many students have requested to join the Youth League. In order to better organize them and help them progress, it has been decided to develop new members and hold a League Day on the 7th. In order to enable students to more clearly understand the tasks and work direction of the Youth League, a summary typical report on the work of the League in the previous semester will be held on the 6th, focusing on Peking University, Tsinghua University, Jihigh, and Huiwen.

    【本市讯】大中学生暑期学习团的同学们在作了革命人生观、学习态度和方法的总结之后，即将进入第二阶段的学习。昨日（三十一日）常委会开会讨论学习内容，决定以学生工作和青年团的工作为学习重心。从一号到六号，主要的是学习学生工作的方向和青年团的性质、任务和工作，目的在解决学什么、怎样学和组织性的问题。八号到十一号，检讨上学期在学校里的学生工作和团的工作的具体内容，重点在学习态度、恢复学习秩序（克服散漫无秩序现象）、同学福利（助学金、救济金的评议等），特别是团与群众的关系。新民主主义青年团暑期学习团委员会认为同学们在这两周来的学习中，有了很大的进步，很多同学有加入青年团的要求，为了更好的组织他们，帮助他们进步，决定发展新团员，并在七号举行团日。为了使同学们更明确的认识青年团的任务和工作方向，六号将举行上学期团的工作的总结典型报告，以北大、清华、冀高、汇文为重点。
