Reforming the Wage System
Clothing Factory Increases Production Efficiency

[This newspaper report] (本报讯) Workers at the Beiping Clothing Factory are actively producing winter uniforms for the soldiers at the front, and production efficiency has significantly increased over the past twenty days. On July 20th, sewing workers averaged 4.35 sets of cotton military uniforms per person, which increased to 7.17 sets by August 10th. For military cap production, the average was 25.625 caps per person on July 26th, increasing to 46.66 caps on August 9th, nearly doubling the output.

One of the important reasons for this increase in production efficiency is the more reasonable reform of the wage system. In the past, sewing workers received eleven liang of millet for each set of work completed. In addition, regardless of how much they made, each person received 154.75 jin of millet per month for staple food expenses, welfare allowances, holiday subsidies, and clothing discounts. Therefore, skilled workers who exceeded their quotas received very small wage differences. At the beginning of this winter uniform production task, the leadership first reformed the old wage system, abolishing fixed wages such as staple food expenses, and increasing the wage per item to one jin and eleven liang of millet. This stimulated everyone's enthusiasm for production. Chang Shuheng, Shi Quan, Wang Jingchun, and Hao Deliang of the fourth sewing department can each make fifty military caps every day. Some female workers, fearing falling behind, are asking the administration to let them live in the factory. Workers in the cotton batting department, not wanting to lag behind, spontaneously initiated a production competition. At the beginning of this project, only three to four thousand jin were produced per day, but now the daily and nightly production has reached more than twelve thousand jin. The workers say they want to improve further.

### 改革工资制度  被服厂生产效率提高

    改革工资制度
    被服厂生产效率提高
    【本报讯】北平被服厂工人为前方战士积极赶制冬装，二十天来生产效率有显著提高。前车工人七月二十日每人平均生产棉军服四·三五套，八月十日即增加到七·一七套。军帽生产，七月二十六日每人平均二五·六二五顶，八月九日增加到四六·六六顶，产量增加了将近一倍。
    这次生产效率的提高，重要的原因之一是由于更合理的改革了工资制度。过去，前车工人每作一套活可得小米十一两，另外，无论作多少，每人每月都可以得到主食费、福利差额、例假津贴及服装折价等小米一五四·七五斤，因此，熟练工人生产超过定额而工资差额却很小。这次赶制冬装任务开始时，领导上首先改革了旧的工资制度，取消了主食费等固定工资，而将每件工资提高到一斤十一两小米，因而刺激了大家的生产情绪。四缝纫部常树珩、史全、王景春、郝德亮，每天都能作出五十顶军帽。有的女工怕落后，正向行政上要求住在工厂里。弹花部职工，为了不落后，自动的发起生产竞赛。这次开工的时候，一天才弹出三、四千斤，现在一天一夜的生产数额已达到了一万二千多斤。工人们表示，他们还要再提高一步。
