    Northeast Furong Copper Mine Resumes Production
    [Northeast News] The Furong Copper Mine, under the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau, officially resumed production in early July after six months of construction. The bureau has now dispatched technical personnel to the mine to conduct geological surveys, and has decided to begin prospecting in July and August, and to start mining ore by the end of September. The plan is to produce 150 tons of refined copper this year. The mine is one of the three major copper mines in the Northeast, located in Zhuanghe County, Liaodong Province, and has abundant reserves. Under the rule of the puppet Manchurian regime, 60 to 80 percent of the mechanical equipment was damaged, so the mine did not operate after the "August 15th" [Japanese surrender]. Construction began in January of this year, and through the joint efforts of workers and technicians, overcoming difficulties in various ways, the mine is currently the highest-grade copper mine in operation in the Northeast. After the repair and exploitation, a large amount of ore will be supplied to the smelter in a steady stream after water separation and beneficiation.

    东北芙蓉铜矿复工
    【东北讯】东北有色金属管理局所属芙蓉铜矿，经半年修建已于七月初正式复工。现该局已派遣技术人员到矿山做地质调查，并决定七、八两月先行探矿，九月底开采矿石，今年计划产精铜一百五十吨。按该矿是东北三大铜矿之一，位于辽东省庄河县境，蕴藏量较丰富。在伪满统治下机械设备遭受破坏者达百分之六十到八十，故“八一五”后该矿即未开工。自今春一月开始修建，经工友技师共同努力，多方设法克服困难，目前该矿已为东北已开工的铜矿中品位最高者。它的修竣开采，将以大量的矿石经过分水选矿后，源源供应冶炼厂。
