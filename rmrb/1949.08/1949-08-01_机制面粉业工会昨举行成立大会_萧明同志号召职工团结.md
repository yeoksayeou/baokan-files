    Mechanized Flour Industry Union Holds Inaugural Meeting Yesterday
    Comrade Xiao Ming Calls on Workers to Unite
    [Our newspaper's report] The city's mechanized flour industry workers held a meeting for three consecutive days starting on the 25th of last month, passed the draft union constitution and the draft collective labor-management contract, elected the union executive committee, and discussed the work of the union. Yesterday (the 31st) at 5:00 PM, the "Beijing Mechanized Flour Industry Union Inaugural Meeting" was held in the auditorium of the Ministry of Railways in Xia Gongfu. The venue was decorated with portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and two huge red flags. The four walls were covered with slogans and banners presented by the workers of various flour mills. Four hundred and sixty-one workers from ninety mechanized flour mills such as Tongcheng, Fuxing, and Weiyi, beat gongs and drums and poured into the venue from all directions. Representatives from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the National Medicine, Dyeing and Weaving, Wool Weaving and other industries, and the Hou Sheng, Danhua and other match factories' trade unions attended the meeting. The meeting was announced to begin at 5:00 PM. After the chairman reported the significance of the meeting, Comrade Xiao Ming from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions delivered a speech, stating: (1) The victory of the National Liberation War is imminent. In the liberated areas, we must vigorously restore production and support the front. The working class has the power to overcome the difficulties encountered in production. (2) To restore and develop production, we must work hard under Chairman Mao's policy of "both labor and capital benefit." (3) The purpose of establishing the union is to unite the workers. Clerks are part of the working class. Both mental and physical laborers are hired by the capitalists and are exploited by the capitalists. If the workers and staff were not united in the past, they must unite in the future; if the clerks stood with the capitalists in the past, oppressing and despising the workers, they must change their attitude today. Workers and staff must be as united as one person to exert their strength. (4) The union is everyone's union. The first criterion for judging the quality of a union is whether the workers are united, and the second is whether the union's affairs are handled by everyone. The union's future work should first focus on unity and mutual assistance, using persuasion, explanation, and self-criticism to overcome phenomena of disunity. And for individual workers who encounter difficulties, the strength of the workers should be used to provide assistance. Secondly, we must intensify our study, grasp policies, and serve the workers well. After Comrade Xiao Ming finished his speech, Comrade Shi Yu from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions reported on the preparatory work of the workers' union and the future tasks of the formal union. Representatives Wang Jinzhang from the National Medicine Industry Workers' Union and Zhao Zhenbang from the Hou Sheng Match Factory Workers' Union both delivered congratulatory speeches. The conference announced the swearing-in of the executive committee members, and all the workers erupted in thunderous applause. After the executive committee members took their oaths, worker representatives expressed their willingness to work hard under the leadership of the union, and the executive committee members expressed their determination to run the union well and seek benefits for the workers. Then, the union constitution was read out, and slogans were shouted. At 8:00 PM, the meeting adjourned after a screening of the famous film "The Bridge."

    【本报讯】本市机制面粉业工人大会在上月二十五日起连续开会三天，通过了工会章程草案及劳资集体合同草案，选出工会执委，并且讨论了工会工作后，于昨（三十一）日下午五时在霞公府铁道部礼堂举行“北平市机制面粉业工会成立大会”。会场高悬毛主席、朱总司令的画像及两面巨大红旗，四壁布满标语及各面粉厂职工赠送的锦旗，通诚、福兴、唯一等九十家机制面粉厂职工四六一人，敲打着锣鼓，分路涌入会场。市总工会，国药、染织、毛织等业及厚生、丹华等火柴厂职工会，均派代表参加。五时整宣布开会，主席报告开会意义后，市总工会萧明同志致词称：（一）全国解放战争的胜利即在目前，在已解放的地区，我们必须大力恢复生产，支援前线，工人阶级有力量克服生产中所遭遇的困难。（二）要恢复和发展生产，必须在毛主席“劳资两利”政策下，好好工作。（三）工会成立的目的就是要把工人团结起来，职员是工人阶级的一部分，脑力劳动者和体力劳动者都是资方雇来的，都受资方剥削，如果职工们过去不团结，今后就要团结起来；职员过去如和资方站在一起，压迫和轻视工人，今天就必须改变态度。职工们必须团结得象一个人一样，才能发挥力量。（四）工会是大家的工会，判断工会的好坏第一要看工友们团结不团结，其次就要看工会的事是不是由大家来办。工会今后的工作首先要注重团结和互助工作，用说服、解释和自我批评的方式，来克服不团结的现象。并且对于个别遭遇困难的工友，应发挥工友群众的力量加以援助。其次，要加紧学习，掌握政策，好好为工友服务。萧明同志致词毕，继由市总工会石羽同志报告职工会筹备工作及正式工会今后的任务。国药业职工会代表王锦章、厚生火柴厂职工会代表赵振邦均致贺词。大会宣布执委宣誓就职，全体职工爆发了春雷一般的掌声。执委宣誓毕，职工代表表示愿在工会领导下努力生产，执委表示一定要把工会办好，并为工人好好谋福利。继又宣读工会章程，并呼口号。至晚八时，在演出有名影片“桥”后散会。
