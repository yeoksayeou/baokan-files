    【Xi'an Electric】In order to raise cotton prices to a reasonable level, thereby rewarding cotton planting and developing industrial production, trade companies in Central Shaanxi are extensively purchasing cotton stocks from farmers. Since mid-June, trade companies in various regions have purchased a total of more than 2.82 million catties of cotton. The Xi'an Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has purchased more than 600,000 catties of cotton since it opened on June 20th. Before the liberation of Xi'an, cotton prices in Central Shaanxi fell particularly rapidly. At a time when the new harvest was not yet available, cotton farmers suffered greatly. In order to protect the interests of cotton farmers, trade companies began to purchase large quantities of cotton stocks from farmers. On June 1st, the market price of cotton in Xi'an was 60 yuan per catty, and the trade company purchased it at 80 yuan. The price was gradually and reasonably increased based on this level. Looking at the exchange ratio between cotton and wheat, on June 1st, wheat was 16 yuan per catty and cotton was 60 yuan per catty, the exchange ratio was less than 1 (cotton) to 4 (wheat). On July 12th, the price of cotton was 350 yuan per catty and wheat was 47 yuan per catty, which is equivalent to 1 to 7.5. This ratio is close to a reasonable level. Central Shaanxi is one of the famous cotton producing areas in our country, with an average annual output of about 1 million dan, and the cotton quality is very good. About 30 percent of the cotton is used by factories in Central Shaanxi, 10 percent is used by farmers themselves, and 50 to 60 percent is sold outside. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, whenever new cotton came on the market, bureaucratic capital and speculative cotton merchants deliberately took a wait-and-see attitude and refused to purchase it. Cotton farmers had to sell their cotton at low prices because they needed to exchange it for grain and daily necessities. In the future, under the protection of the correct policy of the people's democratic government to develop production and take care of the interests of cotton farmers, cotton prices are expected to remain at a reasonable level. This correct measure of the trade company will directly stimulate cotton farmers to increase production.

    广收农村存棉
    适当提高棉价保持合理水平
    【西安电】为提高棉价至合理水平，以奖励植棉，发展工业生产，陕中各地贸易公司，特大量收买农民存棉，自六月中旬以来，各地贸易公司共已收进棉花二百八十二万余斤。西安市花纱布公司，六月二十日开业以来，共收棉六十余万斤。按在西安解放前，陕中各地棉价低落得特别快，时正当青黄不接季节，棉农受损极大，贸易公司为照顾棉农利益，即开始大量收买农民存棉。西安市六月一日市场花价六十元一斤，贸易公司以八十元收买。并依此水平逐渐合理提高。以花与小麦的交换比例看，六月一日小麦每斤十六元，花每斤六十元，交换比例尚不到一（棉）比四（麦）。七月十二日花价三百五十元一斤，小麦四十七元一斤，已等于一比七点五。这一比价已接近合理程度。查陕中为我国著名棉产区之一，年产量平均约一百万担左右，且棉质甚佳，陕中各纱厂用棉约百分之三十，农民自用占百分之十，外销占百分之五十到六十。国民党反动派统治时，每当新花上市，官僚资本和投机棉商即故意采取观望态度，不予收购，棉农则因需要卖花换取粮食及日用品，只得忍痛低价出售。今后在人民民主政府发展生产、照顾棉农利益的正确政策保护下，棉价可望保持合理水平。贸易公司的这一正确措施，将直接刺激棉农增加生产。
