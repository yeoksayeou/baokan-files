Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 17th: The Nanjing Municipal People's Government is actively sending unemployed former Kuomintang government employees, Kuomintang soldiers who were scattered, refugees, and landlords and rich peasants who fled back to their native places to engage in production. From May 29th to the end of July, over 40,000 people have left Nanjing to return to their hometowns for production.

After the liberation of Nanjing, the city was filled with over 60,000 government employees abandoned by the Kuomintang bandit gang. In order to alleviate the burden on the people and enable them to transform themselves to serve the people, the People's Government adopted a responsible attitude, mobilized and helped them return to their hometowns to engage in production, and absorbed some personnel to participate in studies at the East China People's Revolutionary University. At the beginning of the mobilization, many people expressed hesitation and had many concerns, such as fearing that they had lived in the city for too long and had been separated from production for many years, that they had no production skills, that they feared they would not be able to live in small towns or villages, and that they did not understand the attitude of the old liberated area governments and the masses towards returnees, and that they were reluctant to leave city life. The military representatives of each organization patiently explained these issues and organized them for short-term study, so that they could understand that in order to transform the consuming Nanjing into a producing Nanjing, and to transform consuming personnel into producing personnel, everyone must learn a skill and practically participate in production and construction. The people in the old liberated areas welcome returnees to participate in production; as for some fugitive landlords and rich peasants who had oppressed the peasants, as long as they abide by the laws and decrees of the local People's Government, correct their mistakes, and no longer commit wrongdoing, and engage in production peacefully, the local People's Government and the people can be lenient. At present, the vast rural areas of the liberated areas are vigorously recovering and developing. As long as everyone has the determination to engage in production, there is no worry about not having land to cultivate or things to do. After the above education, their thinking changed, their concerns disappeared, and they voluntarily returned to their hometowns for production. For example, among the more than 100 employees of the former Kuomintang Ministry of Education who remained in Nanjing, more than 50 automatically submitted applications to return to their hometowns in a few days. At the mobilization meeting for returning to their hometowns for production held by the various units of the former Kuomintang Nanjing Municipal Government on June 17, more than 90 people signed up on the spot to return to their hometowns.

In order to handle the repatriation matters, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government specifically established a "Handling Office for Returnees" under the Civil Affairs Bureau. All repatriated personnel are transferred by the office to the Xiaguan or Pukou repatriation stations; those who need assistance are given train tickets, boat tickets, and food allowances according to their circumstances. In order to solve the difficulties of transferring trains for returnees along the way, the office also set up "transfer stations" in Bengbu, Xuzhou and other places to take care of returnees along the way. The returnees were extremely moved by the warm care of the People's Government and expressed that after returning to their hometowns, they would work hard under the leadership of the local People's Government to support the liberation war.

The preliminary experience gained in this evacuation and return to hometown work is: First, the mobilization work must be thorough and extensive, and the political significance of returning to hometowns for production and its benefits to them must be explained repeatedly without being impatient. Second, the mass line must be followed; when deciding whether to stay or leave, thorough investigation and research must be conducted in advance, and then handled separately. Third, the repatriation procedures should be as simple and quick as possible. Fourth, an inspection system must be implemented. In order to avoid a few lawless elements from taking the opportunity to obtain travel expenses or selling train tickets on the way, it is best to adopt a station-responsible approach and maintain frequent contact with repatriation agencies in various stations and cities along the way.

　　变消费的南京为生产的南京
    京市政府遣送四万失业难民回籍生产被国民党遗弃公务人员重获生活出路
    【新华社南京十七日电】南京市人民政府正积极遣送原国民党各机关失业公务人员、国民党流散军人、难民和逃亡地主、富农回籍生产。自五月二十九日迄七月底止，先后已有四万余人离宁回籍生产。
    南京解放后，数达六万余被国民党匪帮遗弃的公务人员，充塞着南京。人民政府为减轻人民负担并使他们能有改造自己为人民服务的机会，即采取了认真负责的态度，动员和帮助他们回乡进行生产，并吸收一部分人员参加华东人民革命大学学习。在开始动员时，不少人表示犹豫，存在着很多顾虑，如害怕久住城市，多年脱离生产，对于生产技术一无所长，害怕到小城镇或乡村去无法生活；不了解老解放区政府与群众对于回籍人员的态度；留恋城市生活。各机关的军事代表对这些问题都耐心地予以解释说明，并组织他们进行短期学习，使他们了解：要想变消费的南京成为生产的南京，变消费人员为生产人员，每个人都必须学会一套本领，实际参加生产建设。老解放区人民欢迎回籍人员参加生产；至于有些曾欺压过农民的逃亡地主、富农，只要他们遵守当地人民政府的法令，改过自新，不再为非作恶，安份生产，当地人民政府和人民是可以宽大处理的。目前广大的解放区农村正在蓬勃地恢复与发展，只要大家有从事生产的决心，决不愁没有地种，没有事做。经过上述教育后，他们的思想才转变过来，顾虑消失，自愿回乡生产。例如原国民党教育部一百余留宁员工中，在数天中，便有五十多人自动签递了回籍申请书，原国民党南京市政府所属各单位在六月十七日还乡生产动员大会上当场签名还乡的便有九十多人。
    南京市人民政府为了办理遣散事宜，特在民政局下设立了“处理回籍人员办事处”。凡被遣散的人员，都由办事处转送下关或浦口遣送站；需要资助者，分别情形发给车票、船票及伙食费。为了解决回籍人员中途转车的困难，该处并在蚌埠、徐州等处设立了“转运站”，沿途照顾回籍人员。回籍人员对人民政府的热情照顾，极为感动，纷纷表示：回乡后要在当地人民政府的领导下努力生产，积极支援解放战争。
    在此次疏散回乡工作中，得到的几点初步经验是：第一、动员工作要深入而广泛，要不厌其烦地反复说明回乡生产的政治意义和对他们的利益，不能草率了事。第二、要走群众路线；决定去留时，必须在事前经过很好的调查研究，然后再分别处理。第三、遣送手续力求简单迅速。第四、必须实行检查制度。为避免某些少数不法分子从中混取旅费，或将车票中途卖掉，最好采取分站负责办法，并须经常与沿途各站各城市的遣送机构取得联系。
