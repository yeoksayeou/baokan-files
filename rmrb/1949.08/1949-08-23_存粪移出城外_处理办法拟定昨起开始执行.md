　　Storing Manure Moved Outside the City
  　Handling Measures Drafted and Implemented Starting Yesterday
    [Our Newspaper] The Joint Conference for Handling Manure Matters, composed of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Health Bureau, Civil Affairs Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Manure Workers' Union, Manure Industry Trade Association, and the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, has drafted handling measures to maintain public health in the urban area. These measures target those who set up factories, pits, or store and sun-dry manure in other ways within the city (excluding septic tanks of sanitary toilets). The municipal government has issued an order to all districts to move such operations outside the city within a specified time limit. These measures have been implemented starting from August 22nd of this month. The measures stipulate that a handling group will be formed in each district, composed of one person each from the district public security sub-bureau, district office, manure workers' union, manure industry trade association, and the health bureau. This group will be directly led by the Joint Conference for Handling Manure Matters. The group will first investigate the names, addresses, manure storage locations, types of manure, quantities, storage methods of manure storage persons within their jurisdiction, and whether the manure storage persons have manure factories outside the city and whether they have transportation vehicles. Manure storage persons who originally had manure factories outside the city or used public toilets to store manure should transport the manure to their own factories within five days from the date of implementation of these measures. Manure storage persons who are independent manure workers, "running sea" manure workers, or farmers should transport the manure outside the city within ten days. If independent manure workers genuinely lack the ability to purchase transportation vehicles, they will be registered, and the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative will lend them vehicles and tools, which will be repaid in installments. At the same time, the unemployed manure workers who are transferred to "running sea" and the manure workers who used to make a living by picking up manure will be registered and resettled. The group will crack down on vagrants and demobilized soldiers from the countryside who steal manure while "running sea." If a manure storage person deliberately obstructs the handling measures and refuses to change after education, the group will transport the manure out of the city for sale on their behalf, deducting the transportation costs.
