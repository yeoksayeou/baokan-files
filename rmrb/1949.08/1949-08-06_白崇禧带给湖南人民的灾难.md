After the war criminal Bai Chongxi retreated from Wuhan to Hunan in a sorry state, the people of Hunan gave him a nickname, "White Fox." In fact, this only expresses his cunning and ruthlessness, and is not enough to explain all the crimes of the Bai bandits in Hunan. The first major thing the Bai bandits did after entering Hunan was to use every means to plunder the people's materials, frantically conscripting men, levying taxes, and demanding grain. Bai Chongxi himself asked the people of Hunan for at least three million silver dollars, and the more than 700 taels of gold from the pseudo-Central Bank of Hunan were all looted by them. The Bai bandits' plunder plan covered a very wide range, but the main targets were rice, oil, and salt. Not counting the Bai bandit army and secret agent henchmen who ate, used, and extorted on the spot in various places, the pseudo-Land and Food Administration alone has already purchased grain for the 1950 quota through open requisition and purchase. As for exorbitant taxes, there are even more varieties. In addition to the direct taxes of the provincial and county tax bureaus and the pseudo-Ministry of Finance, there is also the so-called "Pacification Temporary Donation." All import and export goods in Hunan must pay this "temporary donation." Even so, the Bai bandits still felt that they could not be satisfied, so they established organizations such as the "Ship General Team" and the "Ship Inspection Office," setting up checkpoints along the four major waterways of Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Feng within Hunan, and all passing ships had to pay taxes to them according to the size of the ship and the amount of cargo. These bandits could ask for whatever they wanted. In addition, the people of Hunan also hate the temporary donations of the village and baojia. All gatherings and expenses, large and small, in the village and baojia are imposed on the common people, and this huge sum of money is difficult to calculate!

Under the intensified oppression of Bai Chongxi and other Kuomintang bandit gangs, Hunan is now in a state of "moving" on one side and "drying up" on the other. What is being transported to Guangxi day and night on the Xiang-Gui Railway is a large amount of materials looted by the Bai bandit gang, including machinery dismantled from factories. On the other hand, a large number of people in Hunan are going bankrupt and displaced. Stores in the cities are closing down one after another, and the countryside is financially exhausted. It is estimated that the farmers' annual grain income, after being eaten and plundered by the Chiang Kai-shek and Bai bandit gangs, is at most less than 30 percent. In the past, Hunan was known as China's granary, and there was a saying that "if the two lakes are ripe, the world is full." Now, however, nine out of ten houses are empty, and there is a severe shortage of grain.

Seeing that his end is near, Bai Chongxi is trying to make a desperate struggle. Recently, he has strengthened his fascist control, reorganized the original pseudo-provincial government, annexed the non-Chiang and Gui armies, sent a large number of secret agents into various levels of organizations in Hunan, and bought local troops and bandits as his pawns. In order to more conveniently suck the blood of the people of Hunan, they put forward the so-called "integration of military and government," with division commanders concurrently serving as administrative commissioners and regimental commanders concurrently serving as county magistrates, directly plundering the masses. Bai's bandits' frenzied suppression and massacre of the people has recently intensified. Students at Hunan University in Changsha held demonstrations because they opposed the Bai bandits' unprecedented plunder in Hunan, shouting slogans such as "Oppose the transportation of Xiangzi materials out of the province," "Down with the bloodsuckers," and "War mongers get out of Hunan." They were immediately subjected to bloody suppression by Bai's secret service armed forces. The chairman of the student union of Keqiang College was shot and killed by Bai's bandits. The secret service organization "People's Service Brigade" under the Second Department of the pseudo-Ministry of National Defense is equipped with a Canadian pistol for each member, who can arbitrarily kill those they deem unreliable. Recently, Bai's bandits also bought over hooligans and ruffians and established another direct secret service organization called the "Youth Salvation Corps," with Bai himself serving as the general commander, distributed in various counties, towns, and villages, becoming the brutal and poisonous vanguard of the bandit gang in oppressing and plundering the people. In addition, Bai's bandits actively wooed the feudal forces and bandit armed forces in Hunan, and issued commissions everywhere. Song Xilian's unit alone compiled five divisions. Now there are as many bandits as cattle hair in various parts of Hunan. Anyone with a few guns can be a battalion commander or regimental commander, and then use pseudo-positions to arrest people, rob, and extort. Today, Hunan under the rule of Bai's bandits is simply dark and the people are living in misery.

The people of Hunan, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, will never let these rampant bandits go. As early as before the People's Liberation Army entered Hunan, slogans such as "Down with the Gui warlord Bai Chongxi" appeared on the streets of Changsha. In the countryside, there were also constant righteous deeds of the masses chopping bandit soldiers to death with kitchen knives. In central Hunan and other areas, 70,000 to 80,000 people's revolutionary armed forces have stood up under the cruel oppression of the Chiang and Bai bandit gangs. After the People's Liberation Army entered Hunan, they were warmly welcomed by the people everywhere. They demanded: "Don't let the Chiang and Gui bandit gangs escape, wipe them all out in Hunan!" "Capture the White Fox alive!"

### 白崇禧带给湖南人民的灾难

    白崇禧带给湖南人民的灾难
    战犯白崇禧从武汉狼狈退入湖南后，湖南人民送给他一个绰号，叫做“白狐狸”。其实这只能表示他的奸滑、狠毒，还不够说明白匪在湖南的全部罪恶。白匪在进入湖南后的第一件大事，就是不惜用一切手段搜刮和抢夺人民的物资，疯狂地抓丁、派款、要粮。白匪崇禧亲口向湖南人民要的是至少三百万银元，而湖南伪中央银行的七百多两黄金，则被他们全部劫走。白匪的掠夺计划范围包括极广，但主要的目标是稻米、油、盐。不算白匪军和特务爪牙在各地的现吃、现用和敲诈勒索，单说伪田粮处公开的征实、征购，目前就已经征购到一九五零年度。至于苛捐杂税更是五花八门。除去省县税捐处及伪财政部的直接税外，还有所谓“绥靖临时捐”。凡湖南各地所有进出口货物，都得交纳这种“临时捐”。即令如此，白匪仍然觉得不能满足，又设立了所谓“船舶总队”和“船舶检查处”等组织，沿着湖南境内的湘、资、沅、沣四大水路遍设卡哨，所有过往船只，都得按船的大小，货物的多少，向他们纳税。这些匪徒们要多少就得给多少。另外，湖南人民最痛恨的还有乡保甲的临时捐款。乡保甲中举凡大小集会，大小用款，悉数派在老百姓头上，这笔巨大的款子，是难以计算的！
    在白崇禧和其他国民党匪伙的加紧压榨下，目前的湖南，一面是“搬”，一面是“干”。湘桂路上夜以继日往广西搬运的，尽是白匪帮所掠取的大批物资，其中包括从工厂拆卸下来的机器。另一边呢，则是湖南广大人民的大批破产、流离失所城市中的商店纷纷倒闭，农村中则民穷财尽，农民们全年的粮食收入，被蒋白匪帮食用、掠夺剩下来的，估计最多不到百分之三十。过去湖南被称为中国的米仓，曾有所谓“两湖熟，天下足”的谚语，如今竟是十室九空，粮食极感困难。
    白匪崇禧眼看末日临头，妄想作绝望的挣扎，最近更加强他的法西斯控制，改组了原伪省府，吞并非蒋、桂系军队，派大批特务打进湖南的各级组织，收买地方部队和土匪为自己的爪牙。为了更方便地吸吮湖南人民的膏血，他们提出所谓“军政一元化”，以师长兼行政专员，团长兼县长，直接向群众搜刮。白匪对人民的疯狂的镇压和屠杀最近更是变本加厉。长沙湖南大学学生，因为反对白匪在湖南的空前掠夺行为，曾经举行游行示威，高呼：“反对湘资外运”、“打倒吸血鬼”、“战争贩子滚出湖南去”等口号，当即遭受白匪特务武装的血腥镇压。克强学院学生会主席竟被白匪枪杀。伪国防部第二厅系统下的特务机构“人民服务大队”，每个队员都配发有加拿大手枪一支，可以任意杀害他们认为不可靠的人。最近白匪又收买流氓地痞，成立了另一个嫡系的特务组织，名叫“青年救国团”，由白匪本人亲任总团长，分布在各县、镇、乡村，成为匪帮压迫和掠夺人民的凶残、毒狠的先锋。此外，白匪又积极拉拢湖南的封建势力，土匪武装，到处滥发委任状，仅宋匪希濂之一部就委编了五个师的番号。现湖南各地土匪多如牛毛，多少有几杆枪的，都可以当营长、团长，然后再利用伪职抓人、抢劫、敲诈。今天白匪统治下的湖南简直是天昏地暗，民不聊生。
    有着光荣革命传统的湖南人民，是绝不会轻轻放过这些横行霸道的匪徒们的。早在解放军进入湖南之前长沙街头即出现了“打倒桂系军阀白崇禧”的标语。农村中也不断发生了群众用菜刀砍死匪军的义举。在湘中及其他地区的七、八万人民的革命武装已从蒋白匪帮的残酷压榨下挺立起来。人民解放军进入湖南后，到处受到人民的狂烈欢迎。他们纷纷要求：“不让蒋桂系匪帮逃走，把他们全部消灭在湖南！”“活捉白狐狸！”
