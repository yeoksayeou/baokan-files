    East China Establishes Inland River Transportation Network
    Shanghai Private Ships to Form Joint Operations
    [Report from this newspaper] Shanghai, 10th – In order to develop inland river shipping and strengthen the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has decided to establish the East China Inland River Shipping Company and plans to gradually organize the scattered mass transportation forces into an inland river transportation network to strengthen shipping. This will eliminate the bad habits of mutual competition and exclusion between public and private ships during the Kuomintang bandit gang's rule in the past; and it will assist private ships so that they can maximize their transportation capacity. The inland river shipping personnel who are now being transferred to northern Jiangsu will depart in batches before the 15th.
    Another report: Under the vigorous promotion of the Shipping Guidance Committee of the Shipping Administration Office of Shanghai Municipality, private ships in Shanghai have been preparing for cooperative joint operations. Representatives of various private shipping companies on the Yangtze River line held a meeting at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company at 10:00 AM on the 9th and decided to establish the Yangtze River Freight Joint Loading Office, and formulated joint loading methods and the organizational charter of the Joint Loading Office.

    华东建立内河运输网
    沪市私营船舶将联营
    【本报讯】上海十日消息：招商局为了发展内河航运，加强城乡物资交流，决定成立华东区内河航运公司，并计划逐步把分散的群众运输力量，组成内河运输网，加强航运。这样就可扫除过去国民党匪帮统治时期公私船舶互相争利排挤的恶习；并可协助私营船舶，使他们能尽量发挥运输力量。现调赴苏北的内河航运人员，十五日以前将分批出发。
    又讯：沪市私营船舶，在航运处航业指导委员会大力推动下先后筹备合作联营。长江线各私营轮船公司代表九日上午十时在招商局举行会议，决定成立长江货运联合配载处，并拟定了联合配载办法和联合配载处组织章程。
