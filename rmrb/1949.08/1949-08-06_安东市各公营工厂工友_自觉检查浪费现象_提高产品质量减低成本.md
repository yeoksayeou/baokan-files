    [This Newspaper News] Anshan News: Anshan City's public factories are carrying out a waste inspection campaign, and workers are actively offering criticisms with a sense of ownership. These include the following aspects:

    Regarding the waste of raw materials: The Anshan Paper Mill's Management Department did not adequately manage coal storage, causing it all to smoke, wasting more than 700 man-hours to rescue it; two hundred tons of coal reduced the combustion rate by 20%. In the raw materials section, the No. 1 and No. 3 wood kettle chambers leaked medicine from the bottom, but no timely measures were taken to collect it. As a result, in half a day, eight kettles leaked twenty-four small buckets of medicine (enough to fill a one-cubic-meter pit). The Northeast No. 1 Silk Weaving Factory lacked long-term planning. The No. 18 needles used in the front spinning machine were used up last year, but the factory never bought any. Instead, they used the No. 7 needles used in the drawing frame machine as replacements, changing needles once a day, which took up four hours of production time. In the Northeast No. 3 Textile Factory's combing and roving department, the leather roller glue material was not good, and no solution was sought. Every time the leather roller was changed, the operation would break or wind around the leather roller. The oil pot rod used in the cone winding department was not suitable and was not replaced in time. As a result, half of the oil went into the oil hole and half went on the ground. Leading cadres at Guanghua Dyeing Factory didn't even know how much stuff was in the warehouse. Once, waiting to use a water tap, they didn't find any in the warehouse even though there were some, and as a result spent more than two million yuan to make two. There was a shortage of triangular belts everywhere, but eight were stored in the warehouse.

    Waste of funds: Guanghua Industrial Cooperative did not plan production management carefully. It installed more than a dozen toothbrush and toothpaste machines, spending more than 20 million yuan. As a result, the cost was high, and the finished products were too poor, so they couldn't be marketed. Now they are stored at home, worth 152 million yuan, which affects the turnover of funds. The Northeast No. 1 Silk Weaving Factory made budgets that exceeded actual needs. For example, for the oil used to lubricate the machines, it was clear that two jin could be used, but three jin were budgeted. For the masks used by workers, if twenty-five could be used each month, thirty-five were budgeted. At the Anshan Paper Mill, due to inaccurate designs by technicians, many projects often had to be reworked. For example, the electric rollers in the hemp cutting room were sometimes changed from 50 horsepower to 80 horsepower, and then to 100 horsepower; and sometimes from 50 horsepower to 30 horsepower, and then back to 50 horsepower. In the process, the high-voltage line was changed to a low-voltage line, and then back to a high-voltage line, wasting a lot of manpower and materials. The Capital Goods Section only cared about cheapness when purchasing steel sheet, and the ones they bought were not good to use, and broke easily, which directly affected production and wasted national funds.

    Waste of finished products: The Northeast No. 1 Silk Weaving Factory did not have a fixed standard when assigning production tasks, and the quality of finished products suffered. For example, if the task for this month was 10,000 jin, everyone worked very well, and the quality was also very good, but next month the task was suddenly increased by 20%. The workers only paid attention to completing the output, and the finished products were not good, the yarn was uneven, and raw materials were also wasted. The soap produced by Guanghua Industrial Cooperative was even worse in quality. It would ooze oil in the summer, making it difficult to sell. It was reprocessed ten times in July.

    Waste of labor: Guanghua Cotton Weaving Factory No. 4 was not appropriate in the allocation of personnel, wasting labor. In terms of engineering, one engineer per shift was enough, but a work recorder was also assigned to each shift. There was a female employee who was trained for more than half a year, but still couldn't do anything. The director of Guanghua Industrial Cooperative used to ask carpenters to make toys for his children, wasting six or seven workers. The repair department of Anshan Paper Mill did not have a specific division of labor in the past, forming a situation where whoever wanted to repair a machine would go to find a repairman, and many work hours could not be calculated.

    安东市各公营工厂工友
    自觉检查浪费现象
    提高产品质量减低成本
    【本报讯】安东消息：安东市各公营工厂开展检查浪费运动，工友们以主人翁的态度积极提出批评意见。其中包括以下几方面。
    关于原料材料的浪费：安东造纸一厂经理科，对煤保管不够，全部冒了烟，浪费七百多人工去抢救；二百吨煤减少百分之二十燃烧率。原料第一股木釜室一和三号锅底流出药水，但没有及时想办法接，结果八个锅半天的工夫就漏了二十四小桶药水（能装满一立方米的坑）。东北第一丝织厂没有长远打算，前纺一号机使用的十八号针，去年就用完了；可是厂方到底没买，就拿并条机用的七号针来代替，一天一换针，就占去了四小时的生产时间。东北第三纺织厂并粗部，皮辊胶料不好用也不想办法，每次换皮辊时，运转就断头或卷在皮辊上。筒摇部使用的油壶杆不合适，也没有及时换，这样一浇，油眼里一半油，地下一半油。光华染厂领导干部，连仓库有多少东西都不知道。有一次等着使用水龙头，本来仓库里有，可是没有找到，结果又花二百多万元做了两个。各处都缺三角皮带，在仓库里却存着八根。
    资金的浪费：光华实业社，生产管理上计划不周密，装设了十几台制牙刷与牙粉的机器，花了二千多万元，结果成本高，制出成品太差，市场不能推销，现在存在家里，价值一亿五千二百万元，影响了资金的周转。东北第一丝织厂，造预算超过实际需要，如浇机器用的油，明明能用二斤，偏要三斤；工友用的口罩，假如每月能用二十五个，预算就造三十五个。安东造纸一厂，由于技师设计不精确，许多工程常常要翻工。象切麻室的电滚，有的由五十马力换八十马力，又换一百马力；又有的由五十马力换三十马力，后又换回五十马力。在这当中，由高压线变低压线，又换用高压线，浪费很多人工和材料。资材科采买钢弹瓦，只顾便宜，买来的不好使，动不动就坏了，直接影响了生产，浪费了国家资金。
    生产成品的浪费：东北第一丝织厂，布置生产任务时，没有一定标准，成品质量受到损失。比方说这一个月布置一万斤的任务，大家干的挺好，质量也很好，但下月忽然又增加任务百分之二十，工友们光顾完成产量，制出成品不好，线粗细不匀，还浪费了原料。光华实业社制出的肥皂成品更差，夏天出油，不易推销，曾在七月份回锅十次。
    劳动力的浪费：光华棉织四厂，在人员配备上不合适，浪费了劳动力。工务方面本来一班一个工务员就可以了，可是一班又配备上个记工员。有个女职员，培养了半年多，还是什么不能搞。光华实业社厂长，过去叫木工给自己小孩做玩具，浪费了六、七个工。安东造纸厂修理部门，过去没有具体分工负责，形成了谁要修理机器，谁就去找修理工，不少工数无法计算。
