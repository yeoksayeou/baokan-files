To the Editor:

I. In a house sale, a contract was properly drawn up by the buyer, seller, and middleman. However, due to an unforeseen event just before the stamping process, the transaction was halted. After the event was resolved, the buyer and seller discarded the middleman, voided the original contract, and drew up a new one. Is this legal?

II. In previous house sale or rental contracts, the middleman held an important position. Now, if a contract only includes the two parties involved and no middleman, will the government consider it legal?

Ren Yaoxian

Mr. Ren Yaoxian:

According to government policy, the buying and selling of houses can be carried out through self-negotiation between the old and new owners. Once the transaction is completed, the parties can fill out a witness certificate at the Land Administration Bureau, which is then considered a legitimate transaction. As for whether or not there is a middleman, it is up to the old and new owners to decide, and others shall not interfere. As for the sale of a house, even if the price has been verbally agreed upon by the old and new owners and the middleman, and a contract has been drawn up, but it was halted due to an unforeseen event before being stamped; it is permissible for the buyer and seller to agree to draw up a formal contract themselves, without the middleman, and this is not illegal.

　　买卖房屋订契约无中人是否违法编辑先生：
    一、买卖房屋，经中人三方立妥契约，只欠盖章手续，因发生变故，中止进行。变故了结后，买卖双方丢开中人，将原契约作废，另立新契，如此行为是否合法？
    二、以前买卖或租赁房屋的契约中，中人居重要地位，现在如契约中仅有双方事主，而无中人，政府是否认为合法？  任耀先任耀先先生：
    按照政府的政策，房屋的买卖，可由新旧业主自行协议进行；交易成立后，随时到地政局填具见证书，即被认为正当买卖。至于有无中间人，悉听新旧业主自便，其他人不得加以阻止或干涉。至于买卖房屋，虽经新、旧业主和中人三方言明卖价，面立契约，但未盖章即因变故中止；后经买卖双方同意自立正式文契，不经中人，这是可以的，并未违法。
