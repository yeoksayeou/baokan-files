    ACFTU Calls on Workers to Economize for Army Support on "August 1st"
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 31st: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) today issued a call to workers across the country to launch an "August 1st" economize for army support campaign. The full text is as follows:
    Brothers of the national working class:
    This year's "August 1st" marks the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. "August 1st" is not only a glorious day in the history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, but also a glorious day in the history of the Chinese nation.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the direct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and under the personal cultivation, education, and command of the wise leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, has grown, developed, and strengthened. Today, it has become an invincible force.
    For the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has fought heroically, persevering through ten years of civil war, eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, and three years of the People's Liberation War, finally defeating Japanese imperialism and destroying the reactionary rule of the American imperialist lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.
    Because of it—the Chinese People's Liberation Army—the independence of the Chinese nation and the liberation of the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country are guaranteed. It is the loyal defender of the Chinese nation, it is the savior of the Chinese people, and therefore the people of the whole country also cherish it as if they cherish their own children.
    On the 22nd anniversary of the birth of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions specially calls on workers across the country to step up production, supply the front lines with all necessary military materials, support the People's Liberation War, and rapidly achieve national victory. At the same time, launch a economize for army support movement, calling on every worker to freely donate their savings to the People's Liberation Army as a gift from our national working class to the great historical festival of "August 1st."
    All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    July 31st

    全总号召工人弟兄
    “八一”节约劳军
    【新华社北平三十一日电】中华全国总工会今日向全国工人发出开展“八一”节约劳军的号召，全文如下：全国工人阶级兄弟们：
    今年的“八一”是中国人民解放军诞生的二十二周年。“八一”不仅是中国人民解放军历史上的光荣日子，也是中华民族历史上的光荣日子。
    中国人民解放军是在中国共产党的直接领导之下，是在中国人民的英明领袖毛主席、朱总司令的亲自抚养教育指挥之下生长、发展与壮大起来的。它到今天已成了一个不可战胜的力量。
    中国人民解放军为中国人民的解放事业，英勇战斗，百折不挠，经过了十年内战、八年抗战和三年人民解放战争，终于战胜了日本帝国主义，摧毁了美国帝国主义的走狗蒋介石匪帮的反动统治。
    由于有了它——中国人民解放军，中华民族的独立，中国工人阶级和全国人民的解放才有了保证，它是中华民族的忠诚保卫者，它是中国人民的救星，因此全国人民也都爱护它，好象爱护自己的子弟一样。
    在中国人民解放军诞生二十二周年的今天，中华全国总工会特号召全国工人加紧生产，供给前线以一切必需军用物质，支援人民解放战争，迅速取得全国胜利。同时，开展一个节约劳军运动，号召每个工人，将节约所得，自由捐献给人民解放军，作为我们全国工人阶级对“八一”这个伟大的历史节日的献礼。
    中华全国总工会  七月三十一日
