Shanghai People's Radio Station broadcasted on the 24th: News from Shanghai: Production and disaster relief work in the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs is gradually being carried out. The masses have been initially mobilized to break away from incorrect ideas such as simply relying on relief and belittling labor. For example, in Longhua and other places, under the policy of organizing the masses for production and self-salvation, more than 9,000 jin of soybean seeds, more than 2,500 pieces of wood, more than 9,000 jin of rice, and more than 26,000 jin of food for work relief have been distributed in the past two months, along with some fertilizer loans. The Longhua District has organized 20 production groups, one labor brigade, and one production and disaster relief committee since the 15th, laying the foundation for the mass production and disaster relief work.

　　上海近郊
  　组织群众生产救灾
    【上海人民广播电台二十四日广播】上海消息：上海近郊各农村生产救灾工作正逐渐开展。已初步发动群众打破单纯依赖救济、轻视劳动等不正确的思想。如龙华等地在组织群众生产自救方针下，两月来共发放了豆种九千多斤，木料两千五百多根，大米九千多斤，以工代赈救济粮二万六千多斤，肥料贷款一部。龙华区在十五号开始已经组织了二十个生产小组，一个劳动大队，一个生产救灾委员会，打下群众生产救灾工作基础。
