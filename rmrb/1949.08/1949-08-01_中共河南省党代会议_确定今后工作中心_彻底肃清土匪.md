    CCP Henan Provincial Party Congress
    Determines Future Work Focus
    Thoroughly Eliminate Bandits
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 31st] The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened its Second Provincial Party Congress in Kaifeng in June. Present were 207 official delegates from 15 delegations, including local Party committees, city Party committees, military Party committees, and directly affiliated provincial Party committees. The main task of this conference was to discuss how to thoroughly eliminate bandits in Henan, according to the instructions of the Central China Bureau of the CCP. Zhang Xi, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the CCP, and Chen Zaidao, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee and Commander of the Military Region, respectively, made reports on bandit suppression to the conference. After enthusiastic discussions in groups and at the general meeting, the conference determined that the thorough elimination of bandits should be the central task of the entire Party in Henan for a certain period to come.
    The conference analyzed the historical and current situation in Henan, believing that the historical task of eliminating bandits, which cannot be bypassed, has not yet been completed, and that bandits still exist quite widely. Without thoroughly eliminating bandits, all work will be difficult to move forward. In the past year, the enemy launched three counter-offensives against us, and we also carried out three large-scale bandit suppression campaigns, which achieved great results. However, due to our insufficient understanding of the enemy, insufficient spirit of implementing to the end, and unclear guiding ideology for mobilizing the masses to suppress bandits, the bandit suppression work has risen and fallen three times, failing to eradicate the root causes. This conference clearly pointed out that bandits are the armed forces of class enemies and the main tool for the Kuomintang bandit gang's remnants to sabotage and disrupt the people's regime and economic construction in the newly liberated areas. The evil bandit leaders and special agents are integrated, using secret societies, special agents, and baojia (local security system) to carry out armed and unarmed, open and covert, centralized and decentralized, legal and illegal struggles, with armed struggle being their most important form of struggle.
    Based on the enemy's characteristics and multiple bandit suppression experiences, the conference decided that the working policy for bandit suppression is: thoroughly eliminating bandits, overthrowing local tyrants, and mobilizing the masses should be combined and intertwined, and military suppression should be combined with political offensives. When implementing this policy, we must resolutely attack the main bandit forces to the end, not only to defeat them but also to thoroughly eliminate them. We must eliminate scattered bandits and hidden bandits, collect all bandit guns, capture all bandit leaders, dissolve secret societies used by bandits and special agents, disintegrate bandit followers, destroy special agent command organs, overthrow the local tyrants who collude with and harbor bandits, abolish the baojia system, and establish the people's revolutionary rule. To achieve this goal, it is not only necessary for the Party, government, and military to concentrate all their efforts and work hard, with bandit suppression as the central task, but also to form a broad united front for bandit suppression and launch a large-scale, vigorous, and mass movement to suppress bandits and oppose local tyrants.
    The conference pointed out that to vigorously carry out bandit suppression work, it is necessary to concentrate forces, master policies, and rely on the masses. The conference decided to strengthen unified leadership, with Party committees at all levels as the core, to organize all forces. In terms of military struggle, the bandit suppression tactics should be both military and political, and carry out tireless and arduous annihilation battles. The troops must give full play to their high degree of initiative, perseverance, and flexibility. During suppression, they must concentrate against concentration and disperse against dispersion, and pursue and attack relentlessly. All troops must act as both combat teams and work teams, and conduct in-depth policy education. The conference also decided to organize Party work committees and bandit suppression headquarters in key bandit suppression areas and contiguous areas of two or more regions, so that forces can be properly allocated. The conference decided to rely on the broad masses, unite and neutralize all possible social forces, form a broad united front for bandit suppression, and divide and disintegrate the enemy; and, according to the principle of "the ringleaders must be punished, the coerced will not be questioned, and meritorious service will be rewarded," strive for all coerced bandit followers, reward bandits who perform meritorious self-redemption, isolate the enemy to the greatest extent, and resolutely suppress the ringleaders of bandits and special agents. The conference demanded that all localities should clearly distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, between the ringleaders and the followers, and between leniency and strictness, so that we do not treat friends as enemies, nor relax our hold on the ringleaders, and do not "be lenient" to the point of losing principles. The conference stipulated that the people have the right to defend themselves against bandits and to accuse bandit leaders, and also have the obligation to report bandit activities and assist in bandit suppression. To ensure the implementation of policies, the conference stipulated the establishment of people's courts and prisons.
    Bandit Suppression Movement Must Be Combined with Solving the Masses' Urgent Demands
    Regarding how to mobilize the masses to suppress bandits, the conference pointed out that the bandit suppression movement must be combined with solving the masses' current urgent demands, and all cadres must learn to be good at planning for the masses and eliminating harm for the masses, adopting the mass viewpoint and mass style of work. We should solve the current urgent and solvable problems of the masses, such as production and disaster relief, water conservancy construction, financial rectification, war service rectification, reducing burdens, practicing strict economy, and opposing corruption and waste. We should combine bandit suppression with the struggle against local tyrants, and on the basis of the victory of bandit suppression and opposition to local tyrants, according to the level of consciousness and organization of the masses, we should prepare, step by step, and wave by wave, to transition to the high tide of clearing the accounts with local tyrants in the entire region. Therefore, in a certain period, we must not only thoroughly eliminate bandits but also complete the accounting struggle against local tyrants in most areas of the province, in order to prepare for further systematic social reforms.
    Regarding urban work, the conference decided to continue to focus on restoring and developing production. In order to cooperate with the bandit suppression movement, the garrison commands, public security bureaus, and responsible cadres of the counties where the cities are located should, under the unified leadership of the municipal Party committees, organize bandit suppression headquarters to eliminate the gaps in the areas connecting urban and rural areas; and they must strengthen public security work and eliminate bandits and special agents hiding in the cities.
    The conference called on the entire Party in Henan to mobilize, overcome all difficulties, and struggle to complete the glorious and great task of bandit suppression.

    中共河南省党代会议
    确定今后工作中心
    彻底肃清土匪
    【新华社开封三十一日电】中共河南省委会曾于六月间在开封市召开全省第二次党代表会议。到会有各地方党委、城市党委、部队党委、省直属党委等十五个代表团，计正式代表二百零七名。这次会议的主要任务是根据中共华中局指示，讨论如何彻底肃清河南土匪问题。中共河南省委书记张玺、省委常委及军区司令员陈再道分别向会议作了剿匪报告。经过小组和大会的热烈讨论，会议确定了河南省在今后一定时期内以彻底剿除土匪为全党中心任务。
    会议分析了河南的历史情况和目前情况，认为肃清土匪这一个不可跳越的历史任务尚未完成，目前土匪仍相当普遍地存在着。不彻底消灭土匪，一切工作都很难前进一步。一年来敌人曾三次向我反攻，我们也举行了三次大规模的剿匪，收到了很大的成绩。但由于我们对敌人的认识不足，贯彻到底的精神不够，发动群众起来剿匪的指导思想不明确，因此剿匪工作三起三落，未能根除。这次会议明确指出，土匪就是阶级敌人的武装，是国民党匪帮残余力量在新解放区中破坏和扰乱人民政权和经济建设的主要工具。恶霸匪首和特务头子结成一体，利用会门、特务和保卫等，进行武装的和非武装的、公开的和隐蔽的、集中的和分散的、合法的和非法的斗争，而武装斗争是其最主要的斗争形式。
    会议根据敌人的特点和多次的剿匪经验，决定剿匪的工作方针是：肃清土匪、打倒恶霸、发动群众三者互相结合渗透，军事清剿与政治攻势结合。在执行此方针时，对股匪要坚决进攻到底，不仅是要打垮它，而且要彻底消灭它。一定要肃清散匪潜匪，收尽匪枪，捕尽匪首，解散为匪特利用的会门，瓦解匪众，摧毁特务指挥机关，打倒通匪、窝匪的恶霸，废除保甲，建立人民的革命统治。要达到这一目的，不仅要靠党政军集中全力，艰苦奋斗，以剿匪为中心工作；而且必须组成一个广泛的剿匪统一战线，掀起一个大规模的轰轰烈烈的剿匪反恶霸的群众性运动。
    会议指出：要大力开展剿匪工作，必须集中力量、掌握政策和依靠群众。会议决定加强统一领导，以各级党委为核心，把各种力量组织起来。在军事斗争方面，剿匪战术为军事政治双管齐下，进行不怕疲劳的艰苦的歼灭战。部队要发挥高度的积极性、坚持性与灵活性，清剿时必须以集中对集中，以分散对分散，跟踪追击。所有部队一方面要做战斗队，另一方面又要做工作队，深入地进行政策教育。会议并决定在剿匪重点区及两个以上地的毗连地带，组织党的工作委员会及剿匪指挥部，使力量妥善配备。会议决定依靠广大群众，团结和中立一切可能团结和中立的社会力量，组成广泛的剿匪统一战线，分化与瓦解敌人；并根据“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”的原则，争取一切胁从的匪众，奖励土匪的立功自赎，最大限度地孤立敌人，坚决镇压首恶的匪特分子。会议要求各地应划清敌我界限、首从界限、宽严界限，既不能以友为敌，也不能放松首恶，“宽大”得丧失原则。会议规定，人民有防匪自卫和控诉匪首的权利，也有报告匪情协助剿匪的义务。为了保障政策实施，会议规定建立人民法庭与监狱。
    剿匪运动必须结合  解决群众迫切要求
    关于如何发动群众剿匪问题，会议指出必须把剿匪运动与解决群众当前的迫切要求结合起来，全体干部必须学会善于为群众打算、为群众兴利除害的群众观点和群众作风。应该解决群众当前迫切的和可能解决的问题，如生产救灾，兴修水利，整理财政，整理战争勤务，减轻负担，厉行节约，反对贪污浪费等。应该把剿匪与反恶霸斗争结合起来，在剿匪反恶霸胜利的基础上，按照群众的觉悟程度和组织程度，有准备地、有步骤地、波浪式地转入全区的反恶霸清算的高潮。因此，在一定时期内不仅要彻底肃清土匪，而且要在本省大部分地区完成反恶霸的清算斗争，以准备进一步进行系统的社会改革。
    关于城市工作，会议决定仍以恢复和发展生产为中心。为了配合剿匪运动，各城市警备司令部、公安局及所在县负责干部，应在市委统一领导下，组织剿匪指挥部，消灭城乡衔接区的空隙；并须加强治安工作，清除藏匿城内的土匪特务。
    大会号召河南全党动员起来，克服一切困难，为完成光荣、伟大的剿匪任务而斗争。
