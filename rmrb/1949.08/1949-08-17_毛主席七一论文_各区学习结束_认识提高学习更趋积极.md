Chairman Mao's July 1st Thesis: Study Completed in All Districts, Understanding Improved, Learning More Active

[This Newspaper reports] After more than a month of studying "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" in all districts of Ping City, it has now basically come to an end, and study tests have been held one after another. According to incomplete statistics from the current five districts alone, 1,024 cadres participated in the tests. The total average score of the tests was above 60 points, with some districts' average scores failing to reach the mark.

The tests show that the study has achieved great results. The vast majority of comrades have gained a clear understanding of certain vague concepts that existed in their thinking in the past after this study and test. At the same time, it has greatly stimulated and encouraged the learning enthusiasm of cadres and inspired everyone's initiative in learning. After the test papers were collected, everyone scrambled to read them. A cadre in Mentougou District said: "We must work hard in future studies!" In particular, cadres with low levels of education were humbled by this test. They not only demanded to study politics, but also demanded to learn culture.

In this test, there were also a small number of cadres who performed very poorly, with the lowest scores being 25 points. Some cadres in Mentougou District even answered that the four friends of the revolution were "Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin."

The shortcoming of this study test is that when grading the test papers in many agencies, the marking may not have been strict in order to save face. Therefore, those who scored high may not have learned well.

　　毛主席七一论文　各区学习结束　认识提高学习更趋积极
    【本报讯】平市各区学习“论人民民主专政”经过月余时间，现在基本上已经结束，并已先后举行了学习测验，仅目前五个区不完全的统计，参加测验的干部就有一千零二十四人。测验成绩总平均分在六十分以上，个别区的平均分不及格。
    从测验中看出这次的学习是有着很大成绩的，绝大多数同志对过去思想上存在着的某些模糊观念，在这次学习和测验以后有了明确的认识。同时，大大刺激和鼓励了干部的学习情绪和启发了大家对学习的积极性。在收回试卷以后，大家都争着看。门头沟区一个干部说：“以后学习一定得使劲啦！”特别是文化低的干部们在这次测验中受了蹩，他们不但要求学习政治，同时也要求学文化。
    在这次测验中，也有少数干部成绩很坏，他们最低的分数有得二十五分的，门头沟区有的干部把革命的四个朋友竟答成“马、恩、列、斯”。
    这次学习测验的缺点，是在不少的机关中评判试卷时为了照顾情面，可能对试题掌握不严。因此得分多的不见得就学习得好。
