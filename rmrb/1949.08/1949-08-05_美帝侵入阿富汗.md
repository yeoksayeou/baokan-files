US Imperialism Invades Afghanistan
By A'erdamunuo fu
Translated by Yang Changhui

Afghanistan is more than ten thousand kilometers away from the American coast, but American expansionists have not let go because of this. The military and political vanguard of American monopoly capitalists is steadily entering this Asian region that connects the Soviet Union, Pakistan, India, China, and Iran.

The United States' exports to Afghanistan increase year by year. Most of these exports are low-grade goods: inferior silk and woolen fabrics, cheap daily necessities and spices, and old clothes. These commodities rush into the Afghan market like a tide, seizing the territory of local craftsmen and causing their shops to close down. At the same time, American commercial representatives stationed in Kabul also try to monopolize Afghanistan's main export raw materials, such as wool, lambskins, and various furs. Eighty percent of these exported goods are now in the hands of American companies, and Afghanistan's economic life can only breathe through the nostrils of foreign capital. In order to monopolize Afghan lambskins, American merchants have carried out shameless conspiracies, repeatedly forcibly lowering prices, from an average of 150 Afghanis per lambskin to 68 Afghanis. They have also designed to stop purchases, causing serious damage to local trading companies, who have no choice but to obey their command.

But it is not only Afghanistan's foreign trade that is gradually coming under American control. The same is true for other aspects of Afghanistan's economic life. American advisors have interfered in the so-called "economic plan" drafted by Afghan Minister of National Economy, Maid Khan. This plan intends to bring in a large amount of American investment and employ American experts, mainly to build strategically important highways and telegraph and telephone lines.

Afghan politicians are frequent visitors to Washington. In 1947, Afghan Prime Minister Mahmud Khan spent six months in the United States. In July 1948, Minister of National Economy Maid Khan went to Washington. Immediately afterwards, former Prime Minister Hashim Khan also made the same pilgrimage. In contrast, various American "experts" and businessmen are constantly pouring into Afghanistan like a tide.

American businessmen are particularly coveted of Afghanistan's oil. As early as 1936, the American Inland Oil Exploration Company signed an agreement with Afghanistan to exploit oil fields in the Herat region bordering the Soviet Union. This agreement was abolished in 1938; however, due to the strategic importance of this region, the United States has not lost interest. An American geologist named Ke Si, who had surveyed oil fields in Afghanistan, arrived in Kabul in 1944 to serve as a military attaché at the American embassy. Shortly after that, negotiations began on the American lease of northern Afghanistan. At the same time, activities began to explore oil fields and coal mines in the Andekhui and Kakhanabad regions and other places.

According to a report from Tehran, Iran, on February 1st of this year, the Afghan Joint Government has approved the recommendations formulated in negotiations with American representatives. This recommendation stipulates that the Tebul oil field west of Herat, the Darin Dul gold and silver deposits near Kandahar, and the gold mines in the Logar region will be leased to the United States. The company undertaking the lease is the American Morrison-Knudsen Company. This company has the right to build two airports in Afghanistan.

What the United States most desires in Afghanistan is to build air bases. As early as February 1947, the North American Western Airlines signed an agreement with the Afghan government to establish the US-Afghan Airlines. The United States obtained the right to establish airports and supply aircraft on Afghan territory. In addition, it controls the administrative power of the US-Afghan Airlines and the right to assign engineers to the airports.

Tehran newspapers recently also published plans for the United States to loan Afghanistan $250 million. American businessmen took the lead in demanding that this money be used to build strategic highways in areas bordering the Soviet Union and India. These highways are being built under the supervision of three hundred American engineers and technicians.

The construction of strategically important highways far exceeds the needs of the Afghan state. This is entirely in accordance with the American invasion plan. Currently, just the construction of two highways, one from Kandahar to Kamen and the other from Kabul to Yelalabad, has employed 250 American experts.

In order to achieve their profit-seeking, military, and political goals, American monopoly capitalists have seized the right to build the Sarabi Hydropower Station. The water gates of the hydropower station are built near Kabul, and the irrigation canals are diverted from the Helmand River.

The Helmand River flows to the Iranian border, and the downstream water is used to irrigate most of Iran's Sistan region. Under the new Helmand River channel plan designed by American engineers, the irrigation situation in the Sistan region of Iran has been severely damaged. Without the water from the Helmand River, a large amount of land in Iran cannot escape the fate of prolonged drought. However, at the same time, American designers also made the regions in Afghanistan dependent on this river receive very little water.

The canal project has not yet been completed, but it has already become a dispute between Afghanistan and Iran. In the summer of 1947, the Iranian side had already proposed that the canal issue be raised in the United Nations.

The American imperialists' seemingly clever plan to "help" backward nations is actually an attempt to implement the most shameless political pressure. In order to gain the status of supreme arbitrator in the Afghan-Iranian dispute, Washington decided to organize a delegation of three neutral countries to investigate the Helmand River issue. These three countries were chosen by the United States. Due to Washington's intervention, the dispute between Afghanistan and Iran has not been resolved to this day. The United States sometimes promises to help this side and sometimes turns to the other side, using the fact that both sides need the Helmand water source to seek from both countries the leases that the United States wants.

But this is just one example of the price that the people of Afghanistan and Iran have paid for American "aid."

The American plan to completely control Afghanistan politically and economically is encountering British competition. The United States still maintains strong influence in Afghanistan. British imperialists are trying to maintain their interests in Afghanistan with the help of neighboring Pakistan. In order to exert pressure on the Afghan government recently, British authorities delayed allowing Afghan goods to enter Pakistan, in order to force the rulers of Kabul to make concessions. The Anglo-Indian Engineers Association of the Indian company signed a large-scale construction contract in eastern Afghanistan and Kabul province in 1947, striving to squeeze out American companies.

The struggle between these two hostile imperialists was also evident when the North American Western Airlines signed an agreement to open an Afghan air route. At that time, Britain exerted its usual political pressure, allowing the Afghan government to allow it to also establish two air routes, one from Kabul to Peshawar and the other from Kandahar to Karachi. Interestingly, the Indian delegation acted as a puppet when the British government negotiated with the Afghan government.

Both American and British expansionists pay special attention to the Afghan army. The Afghan army occupies an important position in their plans. As early as 1946, the British Daily Mail reported that Britain was supplying Afghanistan with military equipment (such as airplanes) and training Afghan officers in India, all of which were carried out under "good conditions."

In addition, Britain has established a military base in Pakistan, near the Afghan border. The purpose of this action, in addition to facilitating political pressure on Afghanistan, is also to expand the contradictions between the Afghans and the Pashtun people. The Pashtun people are of the same ethnicity as the Afghans and live in areas connected to Pakistan.

No part of Afghan life is unaffected by the United States and Britain. The United States has recently begun to implement "ideological education" for the Afghan people. English courses have begun to be added to primary schools and colleges, and a large number of American teachers have entered Afghanistan. Habibia College in Kabul has become a formal breeding ground for pro-American elements. Graduates can work in American companies or go to the United States.

Movie theaters in Kabul are almost exclusively occupied by American films. Newspapers are full of propaganda from the Associated Press and Reuters, and they often publish translated articles that promote the power of the gold standard and atomic bombs.

Particularly active in Afghanistan is the Morrison-Knudsen Company. The characteristic of this company is that it uses many English-speaking Afghans, almost turning the company into a training center for Americanized Afghan youth, teaching them to worship the American system and praising the "superiority" of the American system as high as the sky. The Afghan government has signed an agreement with the United States to hire a large number of American experts, teachers, military instructors, and engineers to serve in Afghanistan. American advisors are now participating in the work of the Afghan government's mining, national economy, agriculture, finance, and education departments.

The American expansionists' mad plan to dominate the world is to establish a ring of military bases around the globe. Obviously, Afghanistan is regarded as a link in this military base system. This military base system includes regions more than ten thousand kilometers away from the United States, which clearly shows the aggressiveness of the American imperialist plan. The rulers of Afghanistan are turning a deaf ear to these American plans, which is damaging the entire future of Afghanistan.

    美帝侵入阿富汗
    阿尔达蒙诺夫作
    杨昌辉节译
    阿富汗距离美洲海岸有一万多公里，可是美国的扩张主义者，并没有因此放手。美国独占资本家的军事和政治先锋正源源进入这接连苏联、巴基斯坦、印度、中国和伊朗的亚洲地区。
    美国对阿富汗的输出品一年比一年增加。这些输出品大部分是低级的货物：劣等丝织品和毛织品，廉价的日用杂货和香料，还有旧衣服。这些商品象浪潮一样冲入阿富汗市场，夺取了当地手工艺者的地盘，使他们的店倒闭。同时，美国驻在喀布尔的商业代表还设法独占阿富汗的主要出口原料，如同羊毛、羊羔皮和各种皮毛。这些出口货物现在有百分之八十握在美国企业的手中，而阿富汗的经济生活便只有仰外国资本的鼻息了。美国商人为了独占阿富汗的羊羔皮，曾施展无耻的阴谋，再三强行抑低价钱，每张羊羔皮平均从一百五十元阿富汗币减到六十八元，他们还曾设计停止购买，使当地贸易公司遭受严重的损夫，而只得听他们的指挥。
    可是还不仅阿富汗的对外贸易渐渐转入美国的控制之下。阿富汗经济生活的其他方面也是如此。美国顾问染指于阿富汗国民经济部长马伊德可汗拟定的所谓“经济计划”。这计划是打算大量叫美国投资和雇用美国专家，主要是建设具有战略重要性的公路和电报电话线。
    阿富汗的政客们是华盛顿经常的拜访者。一九四七年阿富汗首相马哈穆德可汗在美国消磨了六个月。一九四八年七月国民经济部长马伊德可汗曾经去华盛顿。紧接着前首相哈西姆汗也作了同样的朝拜。和这对照的是美国各方面的“专家”和商人象潮水一般不断涌入阿富汗。
    美国商人特别垂涎阿富汗的石油。远在一九三六年美国内陆石油开采公司就和阿富汗签订协议，开采邻近苏联边境的赫拉特地区油田。这协议在一九三八年废止了；可是由于这地区的战略地位，美国并没有丧失兴趣。曾在阿富汗勘测油田的美国地质学家克斯，一九四四年到达喀布尔，充任美使馆武官。不久以后，就开始美国租借阿富汗北部的谈判。同时也开始了在安德克回和喀汗那巴德地区与其他地方勘测油田和煤矿的活动。
    据今年二月一日伊朗德黑兰方面的报纸传出的消息说，阿富汗联和政府已经批准在和美国代表谈判中所拟定的建议。这建议规定将赫拉特以西的特布尔油田，邻近坎大哈的达林都尔金银矿藏，和罗加地区的金矿租借给美国。承当租借的是美国摩利逊顾德逊公司。这公司有权在阿富汗建筑两个飞机场。
    美国在阿富汗最渴望的莫过于建筑飞行基地。远在一九四七年二月北美西方航空公司便和阿富汗政府订立协定，设立美阿通航公司。美国获得在阿富汗领土上建立机场和供给飞机的权利。此外并控制了美阿通航公司的行政权和在机场上指派工程人员的权利。
    德黑兰报纸最近还发表了美国对阿富汗贷款二亿五千万美元的计划。美国商人率先要求用这笔款项在接连苏联和印度边境的地区，建筑战略性的公路。这些公路由三百个美国工程师和技术人员的监督筑造。
    战略性质的公路建设是远超过了阿富汗国家需要。这完全是听从美国侵略计划。现在仅是建筑从坎大哈到卡门和从喀布尔到耶拉拉巴德的两条公路，就雇用了二百五十个美国专家。
    为了达到他们的牟利的、军事的和政治的目的，美国独占资本家已经攫夺了建筑萨拉比水电站的权利，水电站的水闸建于喀布尔附近，而灌溉运河则引自赫尔曼德河。
    赫尔曼德河流到伊朗边界，下游的河水用来灌溉伊朗色斯丹的大部地方。在美国工程师设计的赫尔曼德河新水道计划下，伊朗色斯丹地区的灌溉情形受到严重损害。得不到赫尔曼德河的水，伊朗的大量土地逃不脱长期旱灾的命运。可是同时，美国设计者也使阿富汗依赖这河水的地区，所得到的水，也极少量。
    运河的工程还没有完成，不过已经成为阿富汗和伊朗两国间的争端。一九四七年夏天，伊朗方面便已主张将这运河问题在联合国提出。
    美帝国主义者表面上“帮助”落后民族的巧妙计划，实际是企图实施最无耻的政治压力。为了使美国在阿伊争端中获得最高仲裁人的地位，华盛顿决定由三个中立国家组织代表团、调查赫尔曼德河问题，这三个国家由美国选择，由于华盛顿这样的干涉，阿富汗和伊朗的争端到今天还没有解决。美国忽而答应帮助这边，忽而又转向那一边，利用双方都需要赫尔曼德水源，图谋自两国获取得美国所想要的租借。
    可是这还仅是一个例子说明阿富汗和伊朗的人民，为了得到美国“援助”所付出的代价。
    美国在政治经济上完全控制阿富汗的计划，碰到英国的竞争。美国在阿富汗现在仍然保有雄厚的势力。英帝国主义者正试图借着邻近的巴基斯坦的协助，保持在阿富汗的利益。英国当局最近为了对阿富汗政府施行压力，拖延准许阿富汗的货物进入巴基斯坦，以迫使喀布尔统治者让步。印度公司的英印工程师协会一九四七年在阿富汗东部和喀布尔省签订了一个大规模的营造合同，努力排挤美国公司。
    这两个敌对的帝国主义之间的斗争，在全美西方航空公司开辟阿富汗航线协议签订的时候，也明显地看出来。当时英国曾施行惯用的政治压力，使阿富汗政府允许她也建立两条航线，这两条航线是从喀布尔到帕沙瓦和从坎大哈到克拉蚩。有趣的是在英国对阿富汗政府进行谈判时，是由印度代表团充当傀儡。
    美英扩张主义者都对阿富汗的军队特别注意，在他们的计划中阿富汗军队占重要地位。英国每日邮报早在一九四六年便报导过英国供给阿富汗军事装备（例如飞机），并且在印度训练阿富汗军官，所有这些都是在“良好条件”下进行的。
    此外，英国在巴基斯坦建立了军事基地，邻近阿富汗边境。这行动的目的除了便于对阿富汗施行政治压力外，还企图扩大阿富汗人和帕坦族之间的矛盾。帕坦族与阿富汗人同种，居住在接连巴基斯坦的地方。
    阿富汗人的生活没有一部分不受美英的影响。美国最近正对阿富汗人施行“思想教育”。初级学校和学院中开始添设英语课程，大批美国教员进入阿富汗。喀布尔的哈比比亚学院变成了正式教养亲美分子的园地。毕业的学生可以在美国公司中做事，或到美国去。
    喀布尔的电影院几乎为美国影片独占。报纸上充满联合社和路透社的宣传，还经常辟栏登载翻译文章，鼓吹金元政策和原子弹的威力。
    在阿富汗特别活跃的是摩利逊顾德逊公司。这公司的特点是使用许多会讲英语的阿富汗人，几乎把公司变成美国化阿富汗青年的训练中心，叫他们崇拜美国制度，将美国制度的“优越性”赞美得象天一样高。阿富汗政府已经和美国签订一个协定，聘请大批美国专家、教员、军事指导和工程师到阿富汗服务。美国顾问现在参加到阿富汗政府的矿冶、国民经济、农业、财政、教育等部门中工作。
    美国扩张主义者统治世界的疯狂计划是建立环绕全球的军事基地，显然阿富汗是被当作这军事基地系统中的一环。这军事基地系统包括了远离美国一万多公里的地区，正明白显示出美帝国主义计划的侵略性。阿富汗统治者对美国这些计划，装聋做哑，是损害着阿富汗整个的未来。
