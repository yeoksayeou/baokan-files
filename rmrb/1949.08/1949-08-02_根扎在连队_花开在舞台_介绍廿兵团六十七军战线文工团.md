	Roots Planted in the Company,
	Blossoms Blooming on the Stage
	– Introducing the Combat Front Art Troupe of the 67th Army of the 20th Army Corps
	Eighteenth Army Corps Zheng Hongyu
	On July 19th, at the closing ceremony of the All-China Congress of Literary and Art Workers, the congress presented a banner to each literary and art team participating in the performance, one of which was presented to the Combat Front Art Troupe of the 67th Army of the 20th Army Corps – embroidered under the red flag emblem were the ten characters: “Roots Planted in the Company, Blossoms Blooming on the Stage.”
	The Combat Front Art Troupe was originally the Combat Front Theater Society in the Red Army, later renamed the Propaganda Team of the Independent Regiment of the 115th Division (formerly the Independent Division). After the Battle of Pingxingguan in 1937, General Nie Rongzhen led the Independent Regiment to establish the Jinchaji Military Region behind enemy lines and was assigned to the First Military Sub-district. Under the leadership of General Yang Chengwu, the name "Combat Front Theater Society" was officially restored in 1938, expanding the personnel to more than 120 people. During the period of streamlining troops and administration in 1942, they persisted with only 30 people. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, they always lived and fought with the military and civilians in the base areas, carrying out literary and art work in companies and villages to cooperate with various political tasks at the time. They had compiled and performed "Luo Tang Ge" (a four-act opera), "Five Heroes of Langya Mountain" (a five-act drama), and plays and songs reflecting combat and production heroes such as "Li Chengshan" and "Han Fengling." During the Hundred Regiments Offensive in 1940, a large propaganda shed two miles long was organized on the Great Wall Ridge. During the Dalonghua annihilation battle, a large-scale mobilization and comfort station was organized in conjunction with the masses of more than 20 villages. When organizing and helping rural theater troupes in the countryside, they successively compiled and performed plays such as "Little Holiday," "Visiting Relatives," and "Spinning Cotton," which were widely performed in the rural areas of the North Yue District. In the army, they wrote small company operas such as "A Basket of Persimmons" and "Five Eggs." During the counter-sweep operations, they fought and broke through with the troops, enduring hunger and cold. When the troops were hiding in the mountain沟, they led the troops to sing and play games to boost morale. In the cruel struggle, Comrades Chen Musha, Xue Tian, and Lu Ding gloriously sacrificed, and Comrade Lu Ben was wounded. Some died under the fire and bayonets of the Japanese invaders, and some were seriously injured and captured, unyielding, and died of hunger strike in prison.
	After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the theater troupe marched north with the army and was active in the Pingjiao area. Some progressive students from Beijing also joined.
	In the spring of 1946, it merged with the Pingxi Advance Theater Troupe. In July of the same year, it was incorporated into the Second Column of the Jinchaji Field Army. As the troops became highly mobile and engaged in continuous marching and fighting, they began to explore new working methods – performing in squares in the form of Yangko teams during combat intervals, so that two regiments could watch the performance every day. In order to closely cooperate with combat missions, they participated in logistics work during wartime. In the Huailai and Jincang battles, the female comrades went to the front-line bandage stations to care for and comfort the wounded; the male comrades led the civilian labor stretcher teams. Under the slogan of "Art Work on the Front Line," they organized battlefield mobilization sheds and position singing teams (some comrades participated in combat) under artillery fire during the Zhengtai Campaign. After the battle, they immediately wrote scripts and performed together with the soldiers.
	During the Baobei Campaign in 1947, they wrote a 21-scene drama "Unity and Merit," which comprehensively reflected the life of the company.
	In the autumn of 1947, the theater troupe underwent a rectification, followed by the "Three Checks and Party Consolidation," which enhanced class consciousness, further clarified the view of serving the soldiers, established a militarized regular life system, and promoted collectivism.
	After the Party consolidation, they systematically and planned to delve into the companies to experience life. They attended classes, drilled, marched, and trained with the soldiers, and helped the companies carry out the "soldiers performing for soldiers" – mass art movement, processing the creations of the soldiers and then performing them in the companies, which was deeply loved by the soldiers, and further promoted and improved the "soldiers performing for soldiers" movement (such as "Fair Trade"). They further integrated with the soldiers in terms of ideology, feelings, and even style.
	After returning from the company, they organized collective creation by leveraging everyone's wisdom and collectively wrote plays such as "Going to the Battlefield," which achieved success in playwriting, music, and performance. This play had been performed in some troops of the 19th and 18th Army Corps, and had been universally performed two or three times in the 67th Army. No fewer than 300,000 audience members had seen this play, and before each battle, cadres and soldiers demanded the performance of "Going to the Battlefield." The Combat Front Art Troupe was collectively awarded a major merit once, and the director Lu Yi was awarded a first-class merit.
	The Combat Front Art Troupe, with its more than ten years of combat training and further transformation in the new-style military rectification movement, had its achievements in its diligent labor since the Liberation War blossomed like a red flower at the Congress of Literary and Art Workers.
	“Roots Planted in the Company, Blossoms Blooming on the Stage” is precisely the evaluation and encouragement of the conference for them, and it is also their own aspiration, and it is also the direction of our efforts.
	Water has a source, and trees have roots; all literary and artistic flowers should be rooted in the masses, and our military art should be rooted in the companies.

    根扎在连队
    花开在舞台
    ——介绍廿兵团六十七军战线文工团
    十八兵团  郑红羽
    七月十九日，中华全国文学艺术工作者代表大会闭幕式上，大会对参加此次大会演出的每个文艺工作团队都赠给锦旗一面，其中一面是赠给二十兵团六十七军战线文工团的——红旗会徽下绣着十个字：“根扎在连队，花开在舞台。”
    战线文工团原是红军中的战线剧社，后改为一一五师独立团（原独立师）宣传队，一九三七年平型关战役后，聂荣臻将军率独立团来敌后建立晋察冀军区，编到一分区，在杨成武将军领导下于一九三八年又正式恢复“战线剧社”名号，人员扩大到一百二十余人，四二年精兵简政时期，仅以三十人坚持。抗日战争中，他们始终和根据地军民一起生活、战斗，开展连队与乡村的文艺工作，配合了当时各种政治任务。曾编演“洛唐哥”（四幕歌剧）“狼牙山五勇士”（五幕话剧）及“李成山”“韩凤龄”等反映战斗生产英雄的剧与歌。一九四○年百团大战在长城岭上，组织了二里长的大鼓动棚。大龙花歼灭战，曾结合二十余村群众，组织了大型的鼓动慰问站。在下乡组织与帮助农村剧团工作时，先后编演了“小过节”“探亲家”“纺棉花”等剧，普遍在北狱区农村中上演，在部队中又写出“一筐柿子”“五个鸡蛋”等连队小歌剧。在反扫荡中和部队一起战斗突围忍饥受冻，部队在山沟隐蔽，领导部队唱歌、游戏，鼓舞士气，在残酷斗争中，先后有陈慕沙、雪天、鲁丁三同志光荣牺牲，路奔同志负伤。有的死难于日寇炮火刺刀下，有的重伤被俘，顽强不屈，绝食死于狱中。
    日寇投降，剧社随军北进，曾在平郊一带活动，又有北平市部分进步学生参加。
    一九四六年春与平西挺进剧社合并，同年七月编入晋察冀野战军二纵队，随部队高度野战化，连续行军战斗，开始摸索新的工作方法——在战斗空隙中，以秧歌队形式进行广场演出，每天有两个团可以看戏。为紧密配合战斗任务，战时参加后勤工作，在怀来、津沧二战役中，女同志们身临火线绑扎所，护理、慰问伤员；男同志带领民工担架队。在“艺术工作上火线”口号下，在正太战役中，炮火下组织战场鼓动棚与阵地演唱队（部分同志参加战斗），战斗结束后，立即与战士共同编写剧本，共同演出。
    一九四七年保北战役时间，写出二十一场话剧“团结立功”，比较全面地反映了连队生活。
    一九四七年秋剧社进行了一次整顿，接着又进行了三查整党，提高了阶级觉悟，更明确了为兵服务观点，建立了军事化的正规生活制度，发扬了集体主义。
    整党结束后，有组织有计划地深入连队体验生活，战士们和一起上课、出操、行军、炼兵，并帮助连队开展“兵演兵”—群众文艺运动，把战士们的创造予以加工，再到连队演出，深为战士们所喜爱，又进一步推广提高“兵演兵”运动（如“买卖公平”），在思想感情以至作风气派上进一步和战士们打成一片。
    从连队回来，发挥大家智慧组织了集体创造，集体执笔写出“上战场”等剧，在编剧与音乐和表演上都得到成功。这个戏在十九十八兵团部分部队中都出演过，在六十七军普遍演出两三次，前后不下三十万观众都看过这个戏，而且每次战役前，干部战士都要求演“上战场”。战线文工团曾集体记大功一次，社长鲁易立大功。
    战线文工团以其十余年战斗锻炼，并在新式整军运动中进一步地得到改造，他们在解放战争以来的辛勤劳动的成果，象一朵红花开在文代大会上。
    “根扎在连队，花开在舞台。”正是大会对他们的评价和鼓励，也正是他们自己的愿望，也是我们大家努力的方向。
    水有源，树有根；一切文学艺术之花都应当扎根在群众里，我们部队文艺应当扎根在连队。
