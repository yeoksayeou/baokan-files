　　Explanation
    I. This booklet was written with the support of Comrade Fan Wenlan and was later reviewed and corrected by other comrades. Due to the temporary inability to collect more direct historical materials and the author's own weak abilities, errors in viewpoints, materials, wording, etc., are unavoidable. I hope everyone will offer their corrections.
    II. For the convenience of writing, the book often refers to the United States, which refers to American aggressors or American imperialism, and has nothing to do with the peace-loving people of the United States and international friends of the Chinese people.
    III. The unequal treaties between China and the United States and some historical facts of economic aggression are very tedious to describe and take up space. In addition to including the important ones as much as possible, the rest are omitted. Also, some materials are important, but due to the time of origin, etc., they cannot be verified for the time being. For the sake of caution, they are all included in the footnotes.
    IV. The materials in this book are collected up to September 1948.

    The United States is a relatively late-developing country among the world's capitalist countries. It is also a country with abundant resources and unique advantages, first focusing on domestic operations, and then strengthening its expansion overseas. These two factors determine the process of American aggression against China: first, following or through other countries to aggress against China, second, gradually independent aggression against China, then contending for hegemony in China, and finally exclusive occupation of China. Throughout this process, the United States' aggressive behavior has a particularly close relationship with Japan, which is adjacent to China.
　　I. Aggression Against China by Following or Through Other Countries
    (1840-1905, i.e., from the Opium War to the Russo-Japanese War)
    American trade and diplomacy with China began early in the founding of the United States, during the presidency of Washington. In February 1784 (the forty-ninth year of Qianlong), the American ship "Empress of China" came to China from New York, and six months later obtained Chinese silk and tea and returned fully loaded. In August of the same year, the first American consul in Guangzhou, Mayer Shaw, came to China. In 1832 (the twelfth year of Daoguang), US President Andrew Jackson sent ship merchant Robitz as a diplomatic representative to the Far East, arriving in Guangzhou on the "Peacock" in 1832. When the Qing government authorities discovered that the American ship was a warship, they ordered it to leave immediately. Robitz ignored it and stayed for six weeks before going to Annam. This was the first expression of the American diplomatic representative's contempt for Chinese sovereignty. (Mei and Leiden, translated by Wang Zaoshi, "History of American Foreign Policy," "Wanyou Library" Edition, Volume IV, page 45).
    From the very beginning, the United States participated in the British import of opium into China through Britain. In 1839 (the nineteenth year of Daoguang), the Qing government sent Lin Zexu as an imperial commissioner to Guangzhou to investigate and ban opium. At that time, the Qing court's paper tiger had not yet been exposed. When the Americans heard the news of the "special investigation," they sailed the American ships full of opium to other places. When Lin Zexu arrived in Guangzhou, most of the remaining ships were British, which made Lin Zexu understand the "unusual cunning" of the United States (Lin Zexu, "Report on the Date of Arrival in Guangdong," "Lin Wenzhonggong Zhengshu"). Later, some American ships tried to smuggle opium in, but Lin Zexu discovered it, so they had to retreat (Lin Zexu, "Joint奏 on the Situation of Foreign Ships Trading and the Number of Empty Ships Sailing," ibid.). A lot of the opium seized by Lin also came from the hands of Americans. Britain soon declared war on the Qing government. The United States supported Britain behind the scenes. The commander of the US Navy, Kearney, led a naval fleet stationed on the Chinese seas to support the British army (Wang's translation, ibid., Volume IV, page 459). The United States did not come forward directly, so that the Guangzhou people's resistance target was concentrated on the British. When British trade was forced to stop, the United States came out to lobby for Britain, asking the Qing government: "The situation of British merchants is also urgent, can they trade together?" ("Donghualu" Daoguang 43). In November 1841, former US President Quincy Adams gave a speech to a historical society, believing that "Britain's declaration of war was completely justified" (Wang's translation, ibid.). After the Qing government was defeated, Kearney also pressured the Guangzhou authorities to compensate the United States for losses of hundreds of thousands of taels of silver. After the Sino-British Treaty of Nanjing was concluded in 1842, the United States passed a resolution in March 1843 to submit 40,000 US dollars to the President as activity funds for the United States to develop its business in China. At the same time, the government came forward to ask China to enjoy "most-favored-nation" treatment. US Secretary of State Webster gave the plenipotentiary minister to China, Gu Xing, the following instruction:
    "The US government cannot maintain friendly relations with China if China gives commercial conveniences and various privileges to the people of other countries but not to the United States." (Quoted from Wan Yi, "American Policy in China, 1894-1900," "Diplomatic Monthly," Volume III, Issue 3.)
    Under the threat of the United States, the Qing government signed the Sino-US Treaty of Wangxia with the United States in 1844 (the twenty-fourth year of Daoguang), stipulating that "if there are other benefits to all countries, the people of the United States shall share them equally." And the extraterritorial jurisdiction enjoyed by foreigners in China was first initiated here by the United States ("Sino-US Five-Port Trade Regulations," "Collection of Sino-Foreign Treaties," Commercial Press, pp. 124-5). This was the beginning of the unequal treaties between China and the United States, and the beginning of the gradual advancement of American aggression against China to obtain so-called treaty "bases."
    In 1857, Britain and France organized a joint army to invade China. Before the launch of the joint army, the British representative in Washington, Napier, proposed that the United States participate in joint action. The US government stated that it was "fair and convenient" (Wang's translation, ibid., Volume IV, page 70). However, President James Buchanan adopted a policy of superficially maintaining "friendship" with the Qing government and secretly assisting Britain and France due to domestic political instability. First, he allowed Britain and France to send troops, and then the United States came out as a mediator for the belligerent countries. US Secretary of State Cass ordered the new minister to China, Reed: "You can freely communicate with the British and French ministers and explain to the Chinese people that the President believes that the purpose of the allied countries is legitimate." (ibid.) When the military action against China began, the US military accepted a month's military pay from Britain and concentrated the US fleet on the Chinese seas in the Huangpu River along with the British and French warships. (Xue Fucheng: "Book on the Changes in Hanyang, Ye Bai, and Guangzhou," "Yong ＠ Complete Works") In 1858 (the eighth year of Xianfeng), the allied forces went north to attack Tianjin. Before the British and French troops arrived in Tianjin, the United States signed the Sino-US Treaty of Tianjin with the Qing government. After Britain and France forced the Qing government to sign the Treaty of Tianjin, the United States demanded equal benefits and added eight more articles to the Sino-US Treaty of Tianjin. In these treaties, in addition to expanding consular jurisdiction, the United States also obtained rights such as customs agreements, inland navigation, inland travel, and freedom of preaching. ("Sino-US Treaty of Peace and Friendship," Article 11 and below, "Collection of Sino-Foreign Treaties," p. 127).
    In June 1859, Britain and France organized a second joint army due to the issue of changing the route for the exchange of treaties. US warships also entered Dagu with British and French warships, encountering resistance from the Qing army. The British army suffered heavy losses, and the commander of the British fleet, Hope, was also seriously injured, leaving only three British people able to continue fighting. The commander of the US fleet, Tattnall, took over and fired artillery at the Qing army, and sent American steamships to cooperate with British small steamships to enter the battle line, and shouted loudly: "The relationship between people of the same race is always closer than that of outsiders!" (Wang's translation, ibid., Volume IV, page 76). On the one hand, it tried its best to pretend to be a "mediator" to the Qing government. In the spring of 1858, three US warships and the British and French fleets gathered in Baihe. The Qing government sent the Governor-General of Zhili, Tan Tingxiang, etc., to negotiate peace. The British and French representatives said that he was "not qualified for the responsibility of plenipotentiary" and refused to contact him. Only the Americans communicated with him (Xiao Yishan: "General History of the Qing Dynasty," "Lectures at the Beiping Wenzhi College," Volume II, p. 259). Later, when exchanging treaties, the Qing government asked the envoys of all countries to change their route from Beitang. Britain and France "refused to comply," but the US envoy, Walru Shan, alone complied and changed his route to Beitang, putting the Qing government into its trap. It either said that "the United States is respectful" ("Donghualu" Xianfeng 78, p. 23) or "the US envoy...his words are respectful and come from sincerity" (ibid. Xianfeng 87, pp. 6-7). However, some people in the Qing government saw through the United States' two-faced tactics. Gui Liang, the imperial envoy who went to Beitang to exchange treaties with the United States, said in his memorial: "Your Majesty observes that the Americans initially joined Britain and France in invading, but their country is in the Atlantic Ocean, far away from China, and they dared not act rashly. When they requested to exchange treaties, it was not that they did not want to emulate Britain and Russia's recklessness. Seeing that Britain and Russia had suffered heavy losses and all countries had failed, they thought of mediating..." ("Records of the Beginning and End of Trade," quoted from Jiang Fasheng: "Notes on Sino-US Relations," p. 64). This precisely illustrates that the United States' aggressive actions were completely consistent with those of Britain and France. The difference was that Britain and France used military force to aggress frontally and obtain benefits, while the United States avoided frontal military aggression and followed behind Britain and France to obtain the same benefits.

    美国在世界资本主义国家中，是比较后起的一个国家。它又是一个资源丰富得天独厚的国家，首先着重在国内的经营，然后才加强其对海外的扩张。这两个因素，规定了美国侵略中国的过程：起先是追随或通过别国向中国侵略，其次是逐渐独立的侵略中国，再其次是争夺中国霸权，最后则进行独占中国。在这全部过程中，美国的侵略行为与邻近中国的日本，尤有特别紧密的关系。
　　一　追随或通过别国向中国侵略
    （一八四○——一九○五即从鸦片战争到日俄战争）
    美国对中国的通商与外交，早在美国建国初期，华盛顿任总统时，即已开始。一七八四年（乾隆四十九年）二月，美船“中国皇后号”从纽约来华，六个月后取得中国丝茶满载而归；同年八月，首在美国驻广州领事梅耶·萧（ＭａｉｏｎＳｈａｗ）来中国。一八三二年（道光十二年）美总统甲克逊（Ａｎｄｒｅｗ．Ｊａｃｋｓｏｎ）派船业商人罗伯子为远东外交代表，于一八三二年乘“孔雀号”至广州靠岸。清政府当局发现美船是一个兵舰时，下命令叫它立即离开，罗伯子置之不理，逗留了六个星期然后去安南。这第一次表示了美国外交代表对中国主权的蔑视。（美、莱丹著，王造时译“美国外交政策史”“万有文库”版第四册四五页。）
    英国向中国输入鸦片，一开始美国就通过英国参加，一八三九年（道光十九年）清政府派林则徐为钦差大臣往广州查禁，其时清廷纸老虎还没有被戳穿，美国人听到“特派查办”的消息，把满载鸦片的美国船开往别处，等到林则徐行抵广州，剩下的多为英国船只，这使林则徐懂得了美国的“诡谲异常”（林则徐“发报抵粤日期折”“林文忠公政书”），后来有些美国船还想偷着把鸦片送进来，也被林则徐发觉，只好纷纷退去（林则徐“会奏夷船互市情形并空趸开行只数折”同上书。）林所缴获的鸦片，也有不少是出自美国人手中，英国不久对清政府开战，美国在背后支持英国，由美海军统领基尔尼率领一个海军舰队驻在中国海面，为英军声援（王译前书四册四五九页）。美国却不来直接出面，使广州人民的反抗目标，都集中到英国人身上。英国通商被迫停止，美国又出来替英国活动，询问清政府：“英商情亦急迫，可否一体贸易？”（“东华录”道光四十三。）一八四一年十一月美前总统昆西亚丹穆斯（Ｊｑｕｉｎｃｐ　Ａｄａｍｓ）向一个历史学会演说：认为“英国宣战是完全有理由的”（王译前书）。清政府战败后，基尔尼又压迫广州当局赔偿美国损失数十万两之多。一八四二年中英江宁条约成立，美国会于一八四三年三月通过提出美金四万元交给总统，作为美发展对华事业活动费，同时由政府出面向中国要求享受“最惠国”待遇，美国务卿韦卜斯给来华订约全权公使顾兴这样一个训令：
    “中国所施于他国人民商业上之便宜与各种特权而不及于美国，美国政府不能与中国维持友好关系。”（转见万异“一八九四——一九○○美国在华之政策”，“外交月报”第三卷第三期。）
    在美国威胁下，清政府于一八四四年（道光二十四年）与美国订立中美望厦条约，规定“如另有利益及于各国，合众国人民应一体均沾”。而外人享受中国治外法权，也由美国第一次在这里开其端（“中美五口通商贸易章程”“中外条约汇编”商务本一二四—五页）。这是中美不平等条约的开始，也是美国侵略中国取得所谓条约“根据”逐步进逼的开始。
    一八五七年，英法组织联军侵略中国，联军发动前，英国在华盛顿的代表纳皮尔提议美国参与共同行动，美政府表示是“公平的，便利的”（王译前书四册七○页）。但布兰卿（Ｊａｍｅｓ　Ｂｕｃｈａｕｅｎ）总统因国内政局不稳，便采用了表面与清政府保持“友谊”，秘密协助英法的政策，先让英法出兵，美国然后出为交战国的调人，美国务卿喀斯命令新任驻中国公使雷德：“可与英法公使自由来往，并且向中国人民说明总统相信同盟国的目的是正当的。”（同上书）侵华军事行动开始，美军接受英国供给一个月的军饷，将美国在中国海面的舰队随同英法军舰集中黄浦江。（薛福成：“书汉阳叶柏广州之变”“庸＠全集”）一八五八年（咸丰八年）联军北上进攻天津，美国在英法军到达天津之前，与满清政府订立中美天津条约，英法迫满清在签订天津条约之后，美国要求利益均沾，又在中美天津条约续增八条。在这些条约中，美国除了扩大领事裁判权外，又取得海关协定、内河航行、内地游历、自由传教等权利。（“中美和好条约”十一款以下“中外条约汇编”一二七页）。
    一八五九年六月，英法因换约改道问题组织第二次联军，美舰亦同英法军舰驶入大沽，遭遇清军抵抗，英军受到严重损失，英国舰队长贺布也受了重伤，只剩下三个英国人能继续作战，美舰队长达特罗尔便接上去开炮向清军攻击，又派美国汽船协同英国小火轮进入战线，并高声呐喊：“同种的关系总比外人密！”（王译前书四册七六页）。其对清政府一面，却竭力装出“调人”面孔，一八五八年春间，美舰三艘，同英法舰队云集白河，清政府派直隶总督谭廷襄等去议和，英法代表说他“不足当全权之任”，不予接洽，美国人独与通来往（萧一山：“清代通史”“北平文治学院讲稿”卷下之一，二五九页），后来换约时，清政府要各国使臣改由北塘行走，英法皆“抗不遵行”，美使华若翰独遵照改走北塘，使清政府落入它的圈套，不是说“米国恭顺”（“东华录”咸丰七十八，二三页）就说“米使……词意恭敬，出于至诚”（同上书咸丰八十七，六——七页）。但清政府中也有人看破了美国的两面手段，到北塘与美国换约的钦差大臣桂良在他的奏折中就这样说：“臣按，美人初亦与英法合从内犯，特其国在大西洋，距中国逾远，不敢轻举，当其请换约，非不欲效英俄之肆志，及见英俄已受大创，诸国皆不得逞，即思居间排解……”（“通商始末记”转见蒋发晟：“中美关系记要”六四页），这正是说明了美国的侵略行动全与英法一致，所不同的，是英法正面用武力侵略，取得利益，美国避免正面的武力侵略，而是追随在英法之后，取得同样的利益。
      （未完）
