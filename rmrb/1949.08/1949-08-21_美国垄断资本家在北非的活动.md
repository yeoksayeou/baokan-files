American Monopoly Capitalists' Activities in North Africa
    By Léon Feix, Member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party

    A year ago, Donovan, former director of the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, wrote in an Italian newspaper that the Mediterranean is the strategic heart of Europe, Africa, and the Near East.

    Therefore, it is not surprising that American imperialism, not content with directly interfering in the internal affairs of Greece, the Near East, and Italy, and openly supporting the Spanish dictator Franco, is now trying to gain strategic and economic footholds in Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, which are oppressed by French imperialism. In fact, since 1947, American imperialists have acted as if they were the masters of these countries. They conspire with the French rulers to help maintain and consolidate their position.

    The economic invasion of the United States is particularly evident in Morocco, where American trusts are taking full advantage of the "open door" policy guaranteed by the 1906 Algeciras Act. Anyone who spends a few days in the port of Casablanca, with a population of 800,000, will see that the invasion of money is almost ubiquitous, with excessive numbers of American cars, signs in shop windows proclaiming "American Goods Only," and "Coca-Cola" advertisements everywhere.

    When discussing the issue of French African colonies, the American "Star" newspaper recently stated that much important work remains to be done in order to obtain raw materials and agricultural products for export from regions with vast development opportunities that have not yet been developed. The "Star" even pointed out how to do this, saying that the most needed thing is investment, which France is unable to provide. As such, the newspaper eagerly hopes that American investment should take immediate effect.

    The French government did not wait for American monopoly capitalists to make their suggestions. It stated its own attitude even before Truman made his infamous "Point Four" plan statement about developing the "backward areas" of the world. On January 10, 1949, the French Resident-General in Morocco, Juin, officially declared: "The government will welcome the investment of private capital in Morocco from countries with whom we have a long tradition of friendship and who share common views on commercial issues."

    However, this open appeal could not satisfy American monopoly capitalists, who are eager to control the entire economy of Morocco.

    There is no doubt that American imperialists will intensify their invasion of North Africa. American businessmen are "developing" Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco. After the visit of American industrialist and landowner General Campbell, Guéna, the deputy manager of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, also came to Africa. He said that he was touring the country in order to determine the various projects that urgently need financial assistance, and that it was also possible to hold discussions with local authorities.

    Guéna's work is intended to implement the North African industrialization "Four-Year Plan" that French propaganda desires. The total amount of credit loans earmarked in the 1948-49 budget of this plan is 81 trillion francs. Of this, 43 trillion francs will be used in Algeria, 27 trillion in Morocco, and 11 trillion in Tunisia. Most of these credit loans, which come from large-scale private investment, will be used for financial and military projects: such as the construction of strategic highways, ports, and railways, airports (40 in Algeria, 14 in Tunisia), and the development of natural resource facilities. According to this "Four-Year Plan," phosphate production will increase from 5.5 million tons to 7.6 million tons from 1948 to 1952; iron from 2.8 million tons to 4.3 million tons; lead from 53,000 tons to 174,000 tons; and manganese from 20 tons to 50 tons.

    The real purpose of this plan is to use the "help to develop backward areas" as a cover, while American monopoly capital behind the scenes expands as much as possible and legitimizes its crimes of plundering strategic raw materials.

    The policy that American monopoly capital has sought in this region in the past few years is gradually being strengthened through the opportunity of the "Four-Year Plan." After the Allied landing in November 1942, monopoly capitalists had already seized actual mining privileges. In April 1947, three American financial collectives controlled the "Moroccan Universal Mining Association," which monopolized local lead mines. Since then, large amounts of American investment have invaded the mining industry. In December 1948, two companies (Shell and Gulf Oil), holding 65 percent of the investment, obtained the exclusive right to develop newly discovered oil fields in Tunisia. The primary goal of the American plan in North Africa is to use Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia as bases for preparing aggression against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

    In fact, the United States has never abandoned the military bases it occupied during the war (from 1942 to 1945). A typical example is that the United States still occupies the Port Lyautey (Morocco), a large-scale air and naval base. At the beginning of 1948, it was said that the United States had transferred this base to the French authorities. This transfer was manifested in the fact that the buildings flying the American flag were replaced with French flags, and American officials were given the title of "experts." In other words, nothing has changed. Today, Port Lyautey still has thousands of Americans, a large number of Flying Fortresses, and heavy bombers. A long radar station (more than 3,000 kilometers) has recently been established here.

    Military construction in North Africa is progressing rapidly. In December 1947, the Algerian Communist Party newspaper "Freedom" reported that all secret documents regarding air and naval bases had been transferred by the French Governor-General to the American Consul in Algeria on the orders of the French Ministry of Defense. No official denial was heard regarding this disclosure.

    In July 1948, the French government announced a "military action plan" that had been prepared in North Africa under the leadership of General Juin. Permanent combat command headquarters are under construction.

    Last November, senior American officials inspected radar equipment in Algeria. Weeks later, French military authorities re-consulted local air force commands, asking how many American soldiers and officers they could supply.

    In Tunisia, American naval officers frequently "visit" the Bizerte naval base and the arsenal in Ferryville. At the same time, trains carrying bombs are constantly arriving at Sidi-Ahmed near Bizerte.

    Over the past six months, representatives of the French governments in Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco have been in close contact with High Commissioner for West Africa Béchard, Governor-General of Algeria Naegelen, and Governor-General of Tunisia Mons, all of whom are right-wing socialists. They are accelerating the construction of strategic highways and landing points around the Sahara. Civil airports in Alain Beach, Biskra, Ouargla, Ghadames, and Fort Lallemand have been placed under military control.

    Finally, Algeria has been officially included in the North Atlantic Treaty, on the pretext that it is "one of three parts of France."

    French imperialists are unable to maintain their rule, which is why they openly seek American protection, becoming the constables of American monopoly capitalists in order to obtain some "scraps and leftovers."

    Patriots and democrats in these three North African countries are suffering cruel persecution. Hundreds of democrats have been imprisoned in Morocco and Algeria; ten members of the Central Committee of the Moroccan Communist Party are being interrogated; trade union organizations in Morocco have no freedom; official censorship does not allow any truthful reporting; and the Algerian parliamentary elections on March 20 were a farce. Undercover preparations for military expansion are being made, and foreign troops recruited from the French-occupied zone of Germany are being incorporated into local armies under the guise of "defending peace."

    However, these conspiracies aimed at suppressing the resistance of 23 million Algerians, Moroccans, and Tunisians against the dual oppression of American and French imperialists are doomed to fail. The vast national liberation movement is constantly growing in these countries. Many parties and groups, including some nationalist parties, oppose the open inclusion of Algeria, and in practice Morocco and Tunisia, in the North Atlantic Treaty.

    The people of North Africa, like all oppressed people, have clearly realized that their struggle must be closely linked to the anti-imperialist democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union. They also understand that the struggle for peace against imperialist colonialists, in the words of Comrade Larbi Bouhali, Secretary of the Algerian Communist Party, "is the shortest road to national liberation, the road with the fewest sacrifices."

　　美国垄断资本家在北非的活动
    法共中央委员会委员  里昂·菲克斯
    一年以前，美国前任战略设计局局长多诺汶，在意大利的报纸上曾写道：地中海是欧洲、非洲及近东之战略心脏。
    所以，美帝国主义对于直接干涉希腊、近东及意大利内政，公开地支持西班牙佛朗哥独裁者犹以为未足，也就毫不足奇了；现在它正试图在法帝国主义所压迫下的阿尔及利亚、突尼斯及摩洛哥获得战略及经济的立足地。实际上，自一九四七年美帝国主义者即俨然以这些国家的主人自居了。他们借法国统治者共谋以助力保持并巩固其地位。
    美国经济的侵入在摩洛哥是特别明显，美国托拉斯在摩洛哥正取得一九○六年阿尔及利亚条约所保证的“门户开放”政策的充分利益。任何人只要在八十万人口的卡萨布兰卡港住几天就会看到：金元侵略几乎无孔不入，过多的美国汽车，铺窗上“唯一美货”招牌，“可口可乐”的广告也各处皆是。
    美国“星”报最近于谈到法属非洲殖民地问题时，曾道出许多重大工作亟待完成，以便获得迄今仍未开发的、具有广大发展机会地区的原料及农产品的输出。“星”报甚至于指出怎样作这件事的方法，它说：这些方法所最需要者为投资而法国却无力供给。如是，该报亟盼美国投资应使之立即生效。
    法国政府并未等待及美国垄断资本家提出他们的建议。它在杜鲁门发表关于开发世界“落后区城”声名狼藉的“第四点”计划以前，就表明了它自己的态度。一九四九年一月十日，法驻摩洛哥总督约因曾正式宣称：“政府将欢迎与我们有悠久友谊传统及在商业问题上具有共同意见的各国私人资本在摩洛哥投资。”
    但是，这个公开的呼吁不能满足美国垄断资本家，这些垄断资本是急于整个的控制摩洛哥的经济。
    美帝国主义者将加紧侵入北非，此事已勿庸置疑。美国商人正在“开发”着阿尔及利亚、突尼斯及摩洛哥。在美国大工业家兼地主的堪培尔将军访问之后，国际复兴银行副经理盖纳也来非洲，他曾说：他正游历这个国家，以便确定急需财政援助的各种计划，同时也有可能与地方当局进行讨论。
    盖纳的工作是打算实现法国宣传所希求的北非工业化“四年计划”。这个计划中一九四八——四九年预算所预定的信用贷款总额为八十一万亿法朗。其中四十三万亿法朗用在阿尔及利亚，二十七万亿用在摩洛哥及十一万亿用在突尼斯。这些信用贷款的大部分，来自大规模的私人投资，将用于财政军事计划：如建筑战略公路、港口及铁路、机场（四十个在阿尔及利亚，十四个在突尼斯）及开发天然资源的设置。按照这个“四年计划”，磷酸盐产量在一九四八年至一九五二年将自五百五十万吨增至七百六十万吨；铁自二百八十万吨增至四百三十万吨；铅自五万三千吨增至十七万四千吨；锰自二十吨增至五十吨。
    这计划的真正目的是利用“帮助开发落后地区”为掩护，美国垄断资本则于背后尽量扩张并将其掠夺战略原料的罪行合法化。
    过去几年来美国垄断资本在这一地区所企求的政策，正借“四年计划”的机会而逐渐增强。一九四二年十一月盟军登陆后，垄断资本家已攫得了实际采矿特权。一九四七年四月，三个美国财政集体已控制垄断当地铅矿的“摩洛哥环球采矿协会”，从那时起，大量的美国投资已侵入了采矿工业。一九四八年十二月握有投资百分之六十五的两个公司（贝壳与海湾两石油公司）获得了开发突尼斯新发现的油矿特权。美国在北非计划的第一目标，是利用摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚及突尼斯作为准备侵略苏联及人民民主国家之基地。
    实则，美国从未放弃大战期间（从一九四二年至一九四五年）所占领的军事基地。一个典型的例子就是美帝仍然占领着陆奥梯港（摩洛哥），一个大规模的空军及海军基地。在一九四八年开始时期，据说美国曾把这基地移交法国当局。这移交表现在挂着美国旗子的各建筑物换上了法国旗子，美国的官员戴上了“专家”之称号。换言之，什么也没有改变。今天的陆奥梯港仍有数千美国人、大量的飞行堡垒及重轰炸机。一条长的电达站（超过三、○○○公里）最近已在这里建立起来。
    北非的军事建筑快速地向前进行。一九四七年十二月阿尔及利亚共产党机关报“自由”曾报告说：所有关于空军及海军基地的秘密文件已为法总督依照法国防部的命令移交给美驻阿尔及利亚的领事。关于这一揭露，没有听见任何官方否认。
    一九四八年七月法政府宣布一个“军事行动计划”在约因将军领导下已在北非准备。永久性的作战司令部正在建设中。
    去年十一月，美国高级官员视察阿尔及利亚的雷达设备。数周后，法军事当局复征询各地空军司令部，问他们能供应多少美国兵及官员。
    在突尼斯，美海军官员时常“访问”比塞大海军基地及菲瑞维尔的兵工厂，同时，运载炸弹的火车不断开抵比塞大附近的西底亚赫亚地方。
    过去六个月中，阿尔及利亚、突尼斯及摩洛哥法政府代表与驻西非高级委员必查德、阿尔及利亚总督拿吉仑及突尼斯总督蒙恩曾密切接触，这些人都是右翼社会党人，他们加快速度在撒哈拉周围建筑战略公路及登陆据点。阿仑比查、比斯克、奥尔格拉、盖达米斯及弗尔特尔各地的民用机场已置于军事管制之下。
    终于，阿尔及利亚已正式地包括在北大西洋公约之内，借口它是“法国三部分之一”。
    法帝国主义者无力保持其统治，这就是为什么他们公开地寻找美国的保护，成为美国垄断资本家的宪兵，以便获得一些“残片余蘖”。
    北非这三个国家的爱国者及民主人士遭受着残酷地迫害。数百民主人士在摩洛哥及阿尔及利亚已被囚禁起来；摩洛哥共产党中央委员会十位委员在被审讯；摩洛哥的工会组织没有自由；官方的检查不允许写出任何真理的报道；三月二十日阿尔及利亚议会选举是一幕滑稽丑剧。暗地准备扩军，打着“保卫和平”的伪装把德境法占领区所征募的外国军队编入当地军队里。
    但是，旨在压榨二千三百万阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥及突尼斯人民反抗美法帝国主义者双重压迫的这些阴谋是注定要失败的。广大的民族解放运动在这些国家里不断增长。许多的政党及团体，包括某些民族主义者政党，反对公开地把阿尔及利亚及实际包括摩洛哥及突尼斯于北大西洋公约之内。
    北非的人民，象所有被压迫的人民一样，已明晰认识到：他们的斗争要紧密地连系着以苏联为首的反帝国主义的民主阵营，同时也明白争取和平反对帝国主义殖民地者的斗争，用阿尔及利亚共产党秘书拉尔比·布哈里同志的话来说，“是到民族解放最近之路，极少牺牲之路。”
