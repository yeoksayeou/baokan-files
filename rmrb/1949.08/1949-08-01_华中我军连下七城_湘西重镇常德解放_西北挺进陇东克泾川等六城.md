    Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 31st – The People's Liberation Army on the Central China Front has occupied Changde, an important town in Xiangxi, and Linfeng. A unit of the PLA pursuing fleeing bandits along the Changde-Linfeng highway liberated Linfeng county seat on the 24th. At 1:00 PM on the 29th, they entered Changde South Station. Feng Quan, the fleeing remnant bandit, Major General and Senior Staff Officer of the pseudo-Hunan-Hubei Border Area Pacification Headquarters and concurrently Chief of Staff of the Provisional 5th Division, along with his entourage, seized valuables and property, and fled in five cars. The PLA pursuers caught up and intercepted them all. The entire city of Changde was completely liberated early in the morning. This city is the third largest in Hunan Province, second only to Changsha and Hengyang. It is an important hub for agricultural products from the lake region and western Hunan, and holds an important economic position.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 31st – The People's Liberation Army on the Central China Front has liberated five cities in Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces: Liling, Yongxin, Shimen, Taoyuan, and Songzi. A unit of the PLA advancing southwest from western Jiangxi occupied Liling, an industrial city in eastern Hunan on the Xiang-Gan (Hunan-Jiangxi) Railway, on the 25th, and Yongxin, west of Ji'an in western Jiangxi, on the 29th. The PLA, crossing the Yangtze River from Yisha (Yidu-Shashi) and advancing towards western Hunan, liberated Shimen and Taoyuan, north and west of Changde respectively, on the 25th and 28th. The remnant bandits fled in panic. The entire 816-man First Regiment of the First Brigade of the Hunan-Hubei Border Area Security Force, stationed in a certain area, surrendered to the PLA under the leadership of their regimental commander, Jiang Yuhua, on the 25th, awed by the PLA's power. Prior to this, the PLA had liberated Songzi county seat on the 18th. Another PLA unit pursuing the bandits towards western Hubei annihilated elements of the bandit 15th Army and the 14th Regiment of the Hubei Security 5th Brigade fleeing towards Wufeng on the 26th, capturing alive the bandit deputy regimental commander, He Yue, and many others.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 31st – After achieving a great victory in annihilating four armies of the Hu bandits in the Fu-Mei (扶、＠ - likely place names) area, the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army advanced further into the Northwest, pursuing and annihilating the Ma Bufang and Ma Hongkui bandit armies of Ningxia and Qinghai. In three days, from the 25th to the 27th, they liberated six county seats in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces: ＠县, Lingtai, Changwu, Longxian, Jingchuan, and Ningxian. The Ma Bufang and Ma Hongkui bandit armies fled in disarray before the PLA's advancing forces. The Ma Bufang bandit army's 14th Cavalry Division, which was entrenched in Longxian, was so panicked that they hastily abandoned their rice bowls they had just picked up and did not even have time to recall the guard posts they had dispatched. In Changwu and Longxian, the PLA captured an entire company of the Ningxia Ma bandits' 10th Cavalry Brigade and an entire platoon of the Qinghai Ma bandits' 14th Cavalry Division alive. The PLA is now continuing its advance in triumph.
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 31st – The local armed forces of the People's Liberation Army in southern Shaanxi struck at the bandit army entrenched in the Liangchahe area between Shangxian and Luonan on the 27th and 28th, dividing their forces. They annihilated the armed forces of the Second and Eighth Administrative Inspectorates of Shaanxi and elements of the Sixth Security Brigade Headquarters, as well as the independent battalion and guard battalion of the brigade's First Regiment. A total of 257 enemy officers and soldiers, including the former pseudo-Chaoyi county magistrate Zhang Zhiying, were captured alive. Over 60 enemy officers and soldiers, including the pseudo-Weinan county magistrate Liu Bangzhi and Jiang Binggong, deputy commander of the Sixth Security Brigade, were killed. They seized one mortar, four light and heavy machine guns, over 160 rifles and other military supplies.
