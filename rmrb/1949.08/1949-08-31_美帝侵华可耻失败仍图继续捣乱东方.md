　　U.S. imperialism is plotting conspiracies against the people of the East, particularly against the new China. Secretary of State Acheson declared on the 24th that "the U.S. government is drafting a bipartisan, comprehensive policy towards China and the Far East, which will be submitted to Congress within a few weeks to seek the consent of bipartisan leaders." Some of the main aspects of this so-called comprehensive policy are already being implemented. This involves instigating and organizing counter-revolutionary "Pacific Alliances" and using the remnants of Japanese fascism as pawns for the United States to continue its interference in China. Since Truman expressed open support for Philippine puppet President Quirino's organization of the "Pacific Alliance," the activities of those U.S. imperialist lackeys in organizing the "Pacific Alliance" have become increasingly active. According to United Press and Reuters reports on the 26th, Romulo will fly to the United States on the 27th to "continue his efforts on the Pacific Alliance plan." Romulo will also go to Lake Success to "conduct activities for the Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance among diplomatic representatives of the United Nations and potential member states." At the same time, after Kuomintang bandit Wu Tiecheng held two secret talks with MacArthur in Japan and returned to Taiwan on the 20th, he immediately advocated the traitorous idea of cooperation between Chinese and Japanese reactionaries. With MacArthur's sponsorship, the Kuomintang is secretly recruiting former Japanese invading soldiers in Japan in order to smuggle them into China to help the Kuomintang bandits fight. Meanwhile, in order to make Japan serve the U.S. aggressive policy in the Far East, U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Army Voorhees has departed from the United States for Japan on the 23rd with a group of aggression experts. According to United Press, Voorhees will discuss with MacArthur the plan to establish a "security zone" around China against the Chinese people. These facts once again demonstrate that although the United States has suffered a shameful defeat in China, it still wants to continue to cause trouble.

　　美帝侵华可耻失败仍图继续捣乱东方
    美帝国主义正在策划对东方人民特别是反对新中国的阴谋计划。国务卿艾奇逊于二十四日宣称，“美国政府正草拟对中国及远东两党一致的全盘政策，数周内将提交国会，征求两党领袖的同意”。这个所谓全盘政策的若干主要方面，实际上已经在实施之中。这就是策动组织反革命的“太平洋联盟”，并利用日本法西斯余孽来充当美国继续干涉中国的鹰犬。自杜鲁门表示公开支持菲傀儡总统季里诺组织“太平洋联盟”后，那些美帝国主义走狗组织“太平洋联盟”的活动便愈益积极。据合众社、路透社二十六日电透露：罗慕洛定二十七日飞美，“继续致力于太平洋联盟计划”，罗慕洛并将赴成功湖，“在联合国和可能的会员国外交代表中，进行太平洋反共联盟的活动。”同时，国民党匪徒吴铁城在日本与麦克阿瑟举行两次密谈而于二十日返回台湾后，即鼓吹中日两国反动派合作的卖国论调。在麦克阿瑟的赞助下，国民党正在日本暗地招募前侵华日军，以便将他们偷运来华，帮助国民党匪帮作战。同时，为了使日本服务于美国在远东的侵略政策，美陆军部副部长伍利斯已携带一批侵略专家，于二十三日自美启程赴日。据合众社透露，伍利斯将与麦克阿瑟讨论在中国周围建立反对中国人民的“安全区”的计划。这些事实再次说明美国虽然在中国已遭到可耻的失败，但它依然要继续捣乱下去。
