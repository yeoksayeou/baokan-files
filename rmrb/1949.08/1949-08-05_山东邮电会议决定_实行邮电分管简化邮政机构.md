    Shandong Post and Telecommunications Conference Decides
    to Implement Separate Management of Post and Telecommunications and Simplify Postal Organizations

    [Reported by this newspaper] Jinan News: The Shandong Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Bureau convened a provincial post and telecommunications conference in Jinan City in late July to discuss the separation of postal and telecommunications operations, the implementation of enterprise management in postal services, the simplification of postal organization structures, and the determination of postal office grades, in order to adapt to the needs of the current situation. The conference lasted four days. It was decided that from August 1st, the post and telecommunications departments would be completely separated, and the Shandong Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administrations would be established to specialize in postal and telecommunications services respectively. The meeting also decided, according to instructions from higher authorities, to abolish the original administrative district-level management sub-bureaus and directly affiliated special zones, cities, and county postal offices. Based on actual business conditions, first, second, and third-class postal offices will be established separately, directly under the leadership of the Provincial Bureau, and the surplus personnel will be appropriately handled.
