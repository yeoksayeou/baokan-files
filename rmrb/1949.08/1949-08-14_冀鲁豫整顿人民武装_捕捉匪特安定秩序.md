    Ji-Lu-Yu Rectifies People's Armed Forces
    Captures Bandits and Special Agents, Stabilizes Order
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Electric] Over the past three months, the Ji-Lu-Yu region has achieved significant results in rectifying the people's armed forces. The leadership institutions of the people's armed forces at all levels in this region were not sound to begin with, and after a portion of the cadres were transferred south in February, they were rarely replenished in a timely manner. In some counties, the leadership also neglected the work of the people's armed forces due to the influence of the victorious situation, causing the work of the people's armed forces in certain areas to stagnate. Many cadres and militiamen harbored thoughts of complacency and paralysis, believing that national victory was imminent and that the work of the people's armed forces had no future, requesting demobilization and career changes. Based on the above situation, the military region's people's armed forces department decided on rectification measures, starting from both ideological and organizational aspects. In May, various counties, in conjunction with production in key areas, successively rectified the people's armed organizations at the county, district, and village levels. The rectification work, through mass deliberation and branch discussions, on the one hand, purged impure elements and, on the other hand, absorbed progressive youth to participate in the militia, immediately conducting policy and current affairs education. From May to July, the Puhang sub-district established 308 village-level armed forces departments, purged more than 170 impure militiamen, re-enlisted 112 militiamen, established county-district joint defense, and stabilized social order. In five counties and 34 villages in the northern Henan sub-district, more than 1,300 militiamen were added, along with 330 rifles. After the rectification, the people's armed organizations in most districts and villages have gradually improved, and the morale of the militia has stabilized. During the wheat harvest, the militia, in conjunction with the guarding teams, protected the summer harvest, and the rural order was good, greatly increasing the farmers' enthusiasm for production. In the past three months, the militia in the northern Henan sub-district have independently captured more than 430 bandits and special agents, persuaded 516 people to register for repentance, killed and wounded 15 enemies, and seized more than 930 rifles and carbines, 38 light machine guns, more than 17,000 rounds of various bullets, and other weapons and materials. Since then, incidents of theft and robbery have been greatly reduced. The relationship between the militia and the masses has also been improved.

    冀鲁豫整顿人民武装
    捕捉匪特安定秩序
    【冀鲁豫电】三个月来，冀鲁豫区整顿人民武装，获得显著成绩。本区各级人民武装领导机构，本不健全，二月间一部分干部南调以后，又很少及时配备起来。有的县级领导上又因胜利形势影响，忽视人民武装工作，致使某些地区人民武装工作陷于停顿状态。不少干部和民兵存在太平麻痹思想，认为全国胜利即将取得，人民武装工作没有前途，要求复员和跳行。军区人民武装部根据上述情况，决定了整顿办法，从思想上和组织上分别入手。五月间，各县先后从重点区结合生产，整顿县、区、村的人民武装组织。整顿工作通过群众酝酿与支部讨论，一方面清洗品质不纯分子，一面吸收进步青年参加民兵随即进行政策与时事教育。濮航分区五至七月建立了三百零八个村级武装部，清洗不纯民兵一百七十余人，重新发展民兵一百一十二名，建立了县区联防，稳定了社会秩序。豫北分区五个县三十四个村，增加民兵一千三百余名，步枪三百三十支。整顿后大部区、村的人民武装组织已渐健全，民兵情绪稳定。麦收中民兵结合看青队保卫夏收，农村秩序良好，农民生产情绪大大增高。豫北分区民兵三月来单独捕俘匪特四百三十余人，争取悔过登记五一六人，毙伤敌十五人，缴获步枪匣枪九百三十多支，轻机枪三十八挺，各种子弹一万七千余发及其他武器物资等。从此偷盗抢劫事件乃大为减少。民兵与群众的关系也得到了改善。
