Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 15th: The People's Liberation Army met with local people's guerrillas in the Ningxiang and Xiangxiang areas of central Hunan, and annihilated the majority of a Kuomintang bandit division in the Xiangxiang area, liberating the cities of Xiangxiang and Xinhua. After the peaceful liberation of Changsha, the remnants of the bandit army's 100th Corps and 71st Corps, which had fled from Xiangtan and other places, were intercepted by people's guerrillas along the way, and were pursued by powerful People's Liberation Army troops, causing the morale of the army to collapse. The people's guerrilla force led by Jiang Yaxun, active in the Xiangxiang area, annihilated the majority of the 17th Division of the bandit 100th Corps in one fell swoop, capturing a bandit deputy division commander alive, and victoriously joined forces with the People's Liberation Army.
