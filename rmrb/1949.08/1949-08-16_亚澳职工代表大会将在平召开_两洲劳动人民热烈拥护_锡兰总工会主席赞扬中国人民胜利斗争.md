Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 15th – TASS, Moscow: The newspaper Labor published on the 12th a statement by Wickremasinghe, Chairman of the Ceylon Trade Union Federation, who was traveling from Milan to the Soviet Union. He discussed the resolution of the Second World Trade Union Congress to hold the Asian-Australian Workers' Congress in Beiping in November, stating that this resolution has been warmly praised by the laboring people of the colonies. Currently, this resolution has particular significance. The progressive forces of the East have greatly increased. The victorious advance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has inspired the struggle of millions of enslaved people in the colonies to fight for complete liberation. The national liberation movement against the oppression of the Anglo-American bloc has developed into an unprecedentedly large scale.

The enraged colonialists are attempting to suppress this movement, carrying out bestial atrocities, terror, and massacres. Having suffered defeat in the struggle against the liberation movement in Malaya, the British colonialists have utilized the Dayak tribes (especially those from Borneo) to fight against the guerrillas.

The French interventionists, helpless in the face of the resistance of the Vietnamese people who are resolutely defending their People's Republic, are bombing villages and cities, and strafing farmers working in the fields from the air.

The colonialists and their lackeys in the trade unions are attempting to establish opposition police "trade unions" to undermine the unity of the laboring people. Such fake trade unions have already been established in countries such as India, Ceylon, Malaya, Burma, and Siam. However, the workers refuse to join the police's fake trade unions, and the membership and influence of these fake trade unions are negligible. Therefore, it is no wonder that the plan for a so-called Asian Labor Federation, concocted by the leaders of the American Federation of Labor, has burst like a soap bubble.

Wickremasinghe pointed out that the World Federation of Trade Unions enjoys supreme prestige among the laboring people of colonial countries. After the Second World Trade Union Congress, the sympathy of the laboring people in colonial countries towards the World Federation of Trade Unions has become increasingly strong.

　　亚澳职工代表大会将在平召开
  　两洲劳动人民热烈拥护
    锡兰总工会主席赞扬中国人民胜利斗争
    【新华社北平十五日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：劳动报于十二日刊载自米兰赴苏的锡兰总工会主席维克雷马辛格的谈话，论述第二届世界职工代表大会关于于十一月在北平召开亚澳职工代表大会的决议称：这一决议受到殖民地劳动人民的热烈赞扬。目前，这一决议具有特别重要的意义。东方的进步力量已大大地增长了。中国人民解放军的胜利挺进，已激励了千百万殖民地被奴役人民争取完全解放的斗争。反对英美集团压迫的民族解放运动，已发展成空前巨大的规模。
    恼怒的殖民者企图镇压这个运动，他们施行兽性的暴行、恐怖和屠杀。英国殖民者在对马来亚的解放运动的斗争中遭受失败后，已利用达雅克部族（特别是来自婆罗洲的）的生番来对抗游击队。
    在坚决地保卫自己的人民共和国的越南人民的抵抗下束手无策的法国干涉者，则轰炸乡村及城市，并从空中扫射在田野里工作的农民。
    殖民者及其在职工会里的奴仆们，企图成立反对派的警察的“职工会”，以破坏劳动人民的团结。这种伪工会已经在印度、锡兰、马来亚、缅甸、暹罗等国成立。但工人们拒绝加入警察的伪工会，这种伪工会的会员及其影响是微不足道的。因此，无怪乎美国劳联领袖企图凑合的所谓亚洲劳联的计划，已经象肥皂泡似地破碎了。
    维克雷马辛格指出：世界工联在殖民地国家劳动人民间享有无上的威信。在第二届世界职工代表大会举行之后，殖民地国家劳动人民对世界工联的同情，已愈来愈强烈了。
