Editor's Note: X鶴年堂 is the first store to evaluate wages according to the spirit of the national medicine industry's labor-capital collective contract. We are now introducing their experience for the reference of other stores. The wage commission method in the national medicine industry's collective contract does not have a fixed wage, which is inherently not a good wage system. However, the trade union and the workers maintained the commission method temporarily in order to take care of the customs of the national medicine industry and to allow the capitalists to have certain profits.

X鶴年堂 National Medicine Store is one of the leading large pharmacies in this city. The main store's organization is divided into business, accounting, auditing office, medicine department, measuring department, soaking and moxibustion department, deer park, rolling and grinding, and other work departments, and it has two branch stores specializing in store business. The entire store has a total of ninety staff members, including six capitalists. Before liberation, wages were calculated as 20% of the monthly turnover, and then distributed to each staff member (excluding pharmacists) according to the "shares" they earned. In addition, each person also had a small fixed wage every month, with the highest being 10 pseudo-yuan coupons and the lowest being one yuan. After the liberation of Beiping, the fixed wages were converted to RMB in March, with the highest being 1,000 yuan and the lowest being 100 yuan. From April, it was changed to millet, divided into three grades and nine levels based on each person's responsibility, skills, performance, and seniority, with the highest being 100 jin and the lowest being 10 jin.

At the end of June, the city's national medicine industry labor-capital collective contract stipulated that wages should be entirely based on turnover commission, canceling fixed wages. The store's commission ratio was determined to be 28% based on the size of the turnover. However, the store's employees' wage shares had not yet been democratically evaluated at that time. After everyone held a meeting and discussed, it was agreed that, of the 28% commission, 20% would temporarily be distributed according to the original method of commission wages, 6% would be distributed according to the April fixed wage millet distribution method, and 2% would be distributed equally among the 90 people, in order to take care of the colleagues with lower wage shares.

After the national medicine industry labor-capital collective contract was formally signed, the city's national medicine industry trade union called on all stores to democratically evaluate wages. The store's employees also felt the necessity of reasonably evaluating shares, and began to deliberate. The capitalists announced the old wage distribution table for each person, and the employees were divided into ten groups according to different positions such as drug checker, pharmacist, worker, and apprentice. The groups were organized by position height, that is, from the group with higher wages, and group discussions were carried out based on the principle of equal pay for equal work. During this period, everyone reflected many opinions: some wanted to be completely based on equal pay for equal work, regardless of differences in performance and seniority; some apprentices in the branch stores hoped to be transferred back to the main store to work, not valuing wages but seeking to learn "skills"; the pharmacists' wages were previously extracted based on the amount of money each person sold, but because the business conditions of the main store and branch stores were different, they requested to rotate jobs; some expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that a small number of back-office workers earned too much money by helping the front counter sell medicine during busy times, in addition to their original wages; some suggested that the front counter was too busy and needed to add people; and some even suggested that everyone should be equally distributed and treated equally.

The store's trade union representatives and group leaders collected all kinds of reflections and opinions, and handed them over to the groups for discussion and mutual evaluation. A general meeting was held to explain the significance and methods of evaluation and to discuss the evaluation results of each group. In the discussion, various unreasonable opinions were rejected, and at the same time, persuasive education was conducted for a small number of colleagues who insisted on unreasonable opinions. Correct opinions were supported by everyone. For example, regarding the issue of back-office workers helping to sell medicine at the front counter, after discussion, everyone proposed that workers from the back office could be selected to work at the front counter if the front counter was too busy. In order to achieve fairness and reasonableness, the capitalists held an exam. All back-office workers who were willing to work at the front counter could participate in the exam (the national medicine industry custom is that apprentices go to back-office workers, and then to the front counter to sell medicine, because selling medicine requires medical knowledge, so the wages are higher). As a result, three people were admitted and promoted to work at the front counter. During the general meeting discussion, some people voluntarily reduced their shares. For example, Wei Hechun, the foreman of the measuring and medicine departments, voluntarily reduced his share by one-tenth, aligning himself with the drug checkers and knife room heads. Cai Dongyong, the accountant of the main store, voluntarily reduced his share by five-tenths, in order to have the same treatment as the accountant of the branch store, providing everyone with an example of making concessions based on reason, so that the colleagues who originally requested to increase their shares without sufficient reasons no longer asked for it. After three days of group meetings and general meeting discussions, the evaluation results were finally unanimously approved by all, and no one expressed any dissent. The evaluation results and their differences from the original situation are roughly as follows: (1) Originally, the drug checkers in the main store earned seven-tenths, and the drug checkers in the branch store earned six and a half-tenths. Because the responsibilities were the same, and the abilities and seniority were similar, they were all changed to seven-tenths. (2) The pharmacists' wages were originally extracted based on the amount of money each person sold. Because the business conditions of the main store and branch stores were different, the amount of money earned was different. They were all changed to be uniformly distributed like other employees, with a share of six and a half-tenths. (3) Two people in the storeroom of the two branch stores were changed from five-tenths to five and a half-tenths. One person in the Xicheng branch store who was inspecting fine materials, three people in the medicine department, and one person in the measuring department were changed from four-tenths to five-tenths. In addition, one person who was a teacher in the measuring department was changed from four and a half-tenths to five-tenths. One accountant in the Xicheng branch store and one person in the auditing office were changed from four-tenths to four and a half-tenths. This was to ensure that people with the same work in the main store and branch stores were treated equally. (4) Originally, workers and apprentices who had been in the store for more than three years had the same work and seniority, but the shares were different, with three-tenths, two-tenths, and one and a half-tenths. Now, the three-tenths remains unchanged, and the one and a half-tenths and two-tenths are changed to two and a half-tenths or three-tenths. A worker who has worked in the measuring department for four years cannot be based solely on seniority because the responsibility is heavier than that of the medicine department. The worker was changed to have the same treatment as a worker in the medicine department with more than four or five years of experience. The little apprentices originally only earned five-tenths, and they were all changed to one-tenth. (5) The cook and odd-job workers in the main store were originally paid lower shares. Although they had no skills, the intensity of labor was high, and they were all increased from two and a half-tenths to three-tenths.

From the store's wage evaluation, we have several thoughts: (1) In the past, everyone thought that the ideological awareness of employees in private industrial and commercial enterprises was low, not as good as that of employees in public factories and enterprises, and that it might not be possible to use democratic methods to evaluate wages. Especially the wage situation in the national medicine industry is complicated, and some colleagues felt that there were too many difficulties and that it was impossible to start. But from the wage evaluation this time, we felt that as long as we are determined, and discuss things with everyone, and come up with ideas and solutions together, this difficulty can be overcome. (2) It is necessary to first open up everyone's minds, so that everyone understands the significance of democratically evaluating wages and the attitude that individuals should have. Although it takes more time, it is necessary and valuable. The decision of each person's share must be discussed by everyone and agreed by the person himself. There should be no slightest coercion or negligence; otherwise, if one person is dissatisfied and requests a change, it will affect everyone and affect the overall situation. (3) The trade union负责人 or people who lead the evaluation work should set an example in the evaluation, making concessions based on reason, but it should also be noted not to affect other people in the same work position. (4) The original wage distribution situation can be used as the basis for starting the evaluation, and it should be submitted to each group for discussion, and then a general meeting should be held for discussion. Do not hold a general meeting without sufficient preparation, otherwise it will not be held well and will affect everyone's emotions.

　　西鹤年堂国药店职工是怎样评议工资的
    西鹤年堂职工集体创作  蔡东涌执笔
    编者按：根据国药业劳资集体合同的精神，评议工资，西鹤年堂是第一家，现介绍他们的经验，以供其他店铺参考。国药业集体合同中关于工资提成办法，没有固定工资，这本来不是很好的工资制度，但工会及工人方面为照顾国药业的习惯，并使资方有一定利润可图，所以仍暂时维持提成办法。
    西鹤年堂国药店为本市头等大药铺之一，总店组织分营业、帐房、稽核室、药部、斗部、泡灸部、鹿囿、轧碾等工作部门，并有支店二处，专营门市业务。全店共有工作人员九十人，内资方六人。解放前工资系按每月流水之百分之二十提成，再按每一工作人员（售药员例外）所得“份数”分给各人。另外各人每月还有一点固定工钱，最高伪金元券十元，最低一元；平市解放后，固定工钱于三月份改为人民券，最高一千元，最低一百元；四月份起又改为小米，根据各人责任、技术、成绩、年限之不同，分成三等九级，最高一百斤，最低十斤。
    六月底，全市国药业劳资集体合同协商中，曾规定工资为全部按流水提成，取消固定工资。本店提成比例根据流水大小决定为百分之二十八。但当时本店同人工资份数尚未举行民主评议，经大家开会讨论，通过在百分之二十八的提成中，暂以百分之二十仍照原来提成工资之分法分配，以百分之六照四月份固定工资小米分法分配，而以百分之二由九十人平均分配，借此对原来工资份数低的同人予以照顾。
    国药业劳资集体合同正式签订后，全市国药业职工会号召各家民主评议工资，本店同人也感到有合理评议份数的必要，即开始酝酿，由资方公布旧的各人工资分配表，职工按照查包、卖药、工人、学徒等职位不同，分成十组，由职位高亦即工资高的组开始，根据同工同酬的原则，分组进行酝酿讨论。这期间大家反映的意见很多：有愿完全根据同工同酬，不论成绩、年限之不同者；有分店学徒希拨回总店工作，不重工资而求学习到“功夫”者；售药员工资过去系按各人卖钱多少提取，但因总店分店营业情况不同，因而要求轮流调换工作；有的对少数后座工人在生意忙时帮助前柜卖药提取一份工钱再加上原有工资挣钱太多表示不满；有提议前柜工作太忙需要添人者；甚至有提议大家平均分配同等待遇。
    本店工会代表和各组组长把各种反映和意见都收集了起来，交给各组讨论互相评议。并召开大会，讲解评议的意义和方式讨论各组评议结果。在讨论中，否定了各种不合情理的意见，同时对于少数坚持不合理意见的同人进行了说服教育，正确的意见则得到大家的拥护。如后座工人在前柜帮忙卖药问题，大家讨论结果，提出前柜太忙可以提选后座工人到前柜工作。为求得公平合理，由资方举行考试，凡是后座工人愿意到前柜工作者，都可参加考试（国药行习惯由学徒到后座工人，再到前柜卖药，因为卖药需医药知识，故工资较高）。结果考取三人提到前柜工作。在大会讨论时，有人自动降低份数，例如斗、药两部工头魏鹤春、自降一厘，与查包、刀房头看齐。总店帐房蔡东涌自降五毫，以与分店帐房一致待遇，给大家提供了一个凭理退让的榜样，使原来无充分理由要求提高份数的同人也都不再要求了。经过三天的小组会与大会讨论，最后全体一致通过了评定结果，无一人表示异议。评定结果及其与原来情形不同之处大要如下：（１）原来总店查包挣七厘，分店查包挣六厘五，因为责任相同，能力年资亦差不多，一律改成七厘。（２）售药员原来系按各人卖钱多少提取工资，因总店分店营业情形好坏不同，所以挣钱不一样，一律改成和其他职工一样统一分配，份数为六厘五。（３）两处分店堆房看局二人，原五厘改五厘五。西城分店看细料一人，工作药部三人、斗部一人，原四厘改五厘。又斗部先生一人，原四厘五，改五厘。西城分店帐房一人，稽核室一人，原四厘，改四厘五。这样以使总店分店同等工作的人都一律平等待遇。（４）原来进店三年多的工人学徒，工作、年资都相同，但份数有三厘、二厘、一厘五之不同。现改为三厘的不动，一厘五、二厘改成二厘五或三厘。四年工人在斗部工作，因责任比药部重，不能光以年资为根据，改为与药部四年多或五年之工人同等待遇。小徒弟原来只挣五毫，一律改成一厘。（５）总店帮厨及杂役工友，因原来份数较低，虽无技术，但劳动强度大，一律由二厘五增到三厘。
    从本店评议工资当中，我们有几点感想，就是：（１）以前大家认为私营工商业中的职工觉悟程度低，不如公营工厂企业职工，恐怕不能用民主方法评定工资；尤其国药业的工资情况复杂，好些同业都觉得困难太多，无从下手。但从我们这次评议工资中觉得，只要下定决心，遇事多由大家讨论，共同出主意、想办法，这种困难是可以克服的。（２）要先打通每个人的思想，使大家懂得民主评定工资的意义和个人应有的态度，虽然多花一些时间，也是必要的和有价值的。决定每一个人的份数，都要经过大伙讨论和他本人同意，切不可有丝毫勉强和疏忽；否则有一个人不满意要求变动，即会影响大家牵动全局。（３）工会负责人或领导评议工作的人，在评议中应以身作则，凭理退让，但也应注意不要影响其他同等工作职位的人。（４）可以原来工资分配情况作为开始评议的依据，交各小组讨论，然后再开大会讨论。不要准备不足就开大会，否则亦开得不好，就影响大家情绪。
