    North China Military Region Organ

    "North China People's Liberation Army" Launched

    Marks the Beginning of a New Era of Regularization and Modernization

    [This Newspaper] The inaugural issue of the "North China People's Liberation Army," the organ of the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, was officially published today (1st). Commander-in-Chief Zhu personally inscribed on the front page: "Study Regularization, Protect National Defense." The publication of this journal, as pointed out in its inaugural message, "marks that the North China People's Liberation Army is stepping into a new era of regularization and modernization construction," which is of great significance. The full text of its inaugural message is as follows:

    Today, on "August 1st," the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the Red Army—the predecessor of the Chinese People's Liberation Army—"North China People's Liberation Army" is launched. "North China People's Liberation Army" is the organ of the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Its launch marks that the North China People's Liberation Army is stepping into a new era of regularization and modernization construction. All commanders and fighters of our North China People's Liberation Army are infinitely excited about the new tasks they have received.

    How to complete this new task? First, we must firmly establish the concept that the People's Liberation Army is always a fighting force. Why is it that even after North China is completely liberated, and even after we seize national victory in the near future, the People's Liberation Army will still always be a fighting force? Chairman Mao has clearly pointed out to us: "Imperialism still exists, domestic reactionaries still exist, and domestic classes still exist." The People's Liberation Army is an important organizational part of the people's state apparatus. We must rely on it to protect national defense and protect the interests of the people. As long as the people have a strong state apparatus in their hands, they will not be afraid of imperialist aggression or the rebellion of domestic reactionary forces. Therefore, after we have achieved victory in the war, what the people ask of us is not to disarm ourselves, but on the contrary, to strengthen the people's state apparatus. For our People's Liberation Army, this means further efforts in regularization and modernization construction, so that we become a strong national defense force, powerfully and reliably protecting national defense and the interests of the people. Only by earnestly resolving this issue ideologically and organizationally can we all mobilize and consciously and loyally strive to complete this new glorious task.

    Building a strong national defense force is of course not just the task of the army. What is extremely important in relation to it is to industrialize our country. But for the army itself, there is no other way to complete the construction than to study, study, and study again.

    Studying may seem easier than fighting, but in reality, studying itself is a cruel battle. To overcome heavy obstacles on an endless road and achieve one victory after another, we must have a spirit of insatiable ambition and unparalleled courage. There are many obstacles on the road to learning. Generally speaking, accompanied by victory, proud, complacent, and lax emotions may arise within us. Regarding regularization construction, some of us still cannot adopt a resolute attitude to abandon the remnants of guerrilla tactics. Regarding modernization construction, some of us still lack the spirit of courageous pursuit in learning and mastering modern command art and weapons technology, and some even feel discouraged and give up in the face of this arduous learning task. These incorrect thoughts and emotions must be regarded as serious enemies in our study, and we must resolutely defeat them.

    The result of twenty-two years of arduous and heroic struggle has created a good environment and good conditions for us to study. We must cherish the fruits of this struggle, and therefore cherish learning even more. Twenty-two years of arduous and heroic struggle have also told us that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, we can learn well. When we were still very small and weak, in the struggle against powerful foreign and domestic enemies, we learned to strengthen ourselves and defeat the enemy. Then we will certainly be able to learn construction better in a peaceful environment, and today, when we have become an invincible force, we will be able to powerfully protect national defense and the interests of the people.

    The basic task of the "North China People's Liberation Army" is to organize and mobilize the learning of the North China People's Liberation Army, to promote the heroes and creations in learning, and to wage a resolute struggle against the enemies of learning.

    Let us diligently study Mao Zedong Thought, grasp the party's policies and lines, learn modern command art and weapons technology, and improve our cultural and scientific knowledge, so that we become a people's army with high political consciousness, unparalleled combat effectiveness, and cultural education.

### 华北军区机关报  “华北解放军”创刊  标志着进入一个正规化近代化建设的新时期

    华北军区机关报
    “华北解放军”创刊
    标志着进入一个正规化近代化建设的新时期
    【本报讯】中国人民解放军华北军区机关报“华北解放军”创刊号，已于今（一）日正式出版。朱总司令亲在头版题词：“学习正规化，保护国防。”该刊的出版正如其发刊词中所指出：“它的创刊，标志着华北人民解放军，正在踏进一个正规化近代化建设的新时期。”是有着重大的意义的。其发刊词原文如下：
    在今天“八一”，红军——中国人民解放军前身——二十二周年诞辰，“华北解放军”创刊了。“华北解放军”，是中国人民解放军华北军区的机关报，它的创刊，标志着华北人民解放军，正在踏进一个正规化近代化建设的新时期。我华北人民解放军全体指战员，都为自己所受领的新任务而无限兴奋。
    怎样完成这一新任务呢？首先必须坚强树立人民解放军永远是一个战斗队的观念。为什么华北完全解放了，甚至在很快的将来我们夺取了全国胜利之后，人民解放军还永远是一个战斗队呢？毛主席给我们指出的很清楚：“帝国主义还存在，国内反动派还存在，国内阶级还存在。”人民解放军，是人民的国家机器的重要组织部分，要依靠我们来保护国防和保护人民利益，人民手里只要有了强大的国家机器，就不怕帝国主义的侵略，就不怕国内反动势力的造反。因此在我们取得战争胜利之后，人民要求我们的不是自己解除武装，相反，是要强化人民的国家机器。对我们人民解放军来说，就是进一步努力正规化近代化的建设，使我们成为一支强大的国防军，有力地可靠地保护国防和保护人民利益。只有从思想上组织上认真地解决了这一问题，才能全体动员起来，自觉地忠诚地为完成这一新的光荣任务而奋斗。
    建设强大的国防军，当然不仅仅是军队的任务，与之关系极为重要的，是把我们的国家工业化。但在军队本身来讲，完成建设的方法，没有别的，就是学习，学习，再学习。
    学习看来比战斗容易，实际上学习本身即是残酷的战斗。要在无穷尽的道路上，克服重重的障碍，取得一次又一次的不断胜利，必须具备毫不满足的雄心和无比顽强的勇气。学习道路上的障碍是很多的，就总的方面来说，伴随胜利而来，在我们内部可能产生骄傲居功、松懈麻痹的情绪；就正规化建设来说，我们有些人对残存的游击作风，尚不能采取决绝抛弃的态度；就近代化建设来说，我们有些人对近代化指挥艺术与武器技术的学习掌握，尚缺乏勇猛追求的精神，甚至有的在这艰巨学习任务面前，自馁自弃。这些不正确的思想情绪，必须当做我们学习中的严重敌人，去坚决战胜它。
    二十二年艰苦英勇战斗的结果，给我们创造了学习的好环境好条件，我们要珍爱这战斗的成果，因此要更加珍爱学习。二十二年艰苦英勇的战斗，也告诉我们在毛主席朱总司令的英明领导下，是可以学习得好的，当我们还很小很弱，在同强大的国外国内敌人的战斗中，我们学会了壮大自己打倒敌人，那我们一定能在和平环境中，在己经成为不可战胜力量的今天，更好地学会建设，有力地保护国防和人民利益。
    “华北解放军”的基本任务，就是组织与动员华北人民解放军的学习，发扬学习中的英雄与创造，同学习的敌人作坚决斗争。
    让我们勤勉地学习毛泽东思想，掌握党的政策路线，学习近代化的指挥艺术与武器技术，提高文化科学知识，使我们成为一支有高度政治觉悟的、有无比强大战斗力的、有文化教养的人民军队。
