Methods for Curing Red Spiders
	Huaibei Farm, Yang Qingzheng

According to investigations, red spiders have already begun to appear on cotton, soybean plants, melon plants, and eggplant plants in some areas of Pingshan, Lingshou, and Xingtang under the Jianping Special Prefecture of Chahar Province.

Last year, the North China Agricultural Extension Team used the following three methods to prevent and control red spiders in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. Experience has proven that they are very effective, and they are now introduced separately as follows:

I. Lime Sulfur Mixture

Preparation: Grind one catty of sulfur into a fine powder, mix half a catty of quicklime powder, add eight catties of water gradually, and boil it. Stir constantly while boiling for about an hour until the medicine turns reddish-brown (dark earth color). About eight catties of stock solution will be obtained after cooking. If not enough, add water to make it up. When using, dilute one catty of stock solution with one hundred catties of water. The insecticidal efficiency is 100%. Note: 1. Do not use a copper pot when cooking, and do not stop stirring. 2. When storing, add a few drops of oil and seal with wax to prevent it from contacting the air. 3. If crystallization (sludge) occurs during storage, it can be melted by heating before use.

This method has high insecticidal efficiency and is very cheap. It can be used regardless of the weather. Last year, the promotion team promoted it in Guantou Village, Quyang, and it was very popular among farmers. To facilitate the application of the villagers, cooperatives or farms can collectively prepare and sell the medicine (stock solution) at a fixed price so that the villagers can use it by simply diluting it with cold water.

II. Thin Flour Paste Water

Preparation: Use one catty of fine white flour, add eight catties of water, and mix into a thin batter. After mixing well, add another two catties of cold water and stir. When using, add another eight catties of clean water per catty, stir well, and it is ready to use. Another method is to first mix one catty of white flour with two catties of cold water to form a paste, then slowly add eight catties of boiling water, stirring as you pour, and stir thoroughly. This mixing method is easier to master the heat, and the water mixing method is the same as above.

Usage: On a sunny day with strong sunlight, spray the flour paste water on the leaves of crops that have red spiders. In less than a short while, the red spider insects will be dried to death on the leaves.

Last year, the half acre of watermelon red spiders of Ma Laojing in Baisha Village, Qiqu District, Tang County, were treated with this method.

Note: 1. It is very important to master the heat for making the flour paste. If it is overcooked, it will easily form lumps. If it is too raw, it will not be effective. 2. It is not good to spray on cloudy days. It must be done on sunny days. 3. Using the leftover noodle soup after eating white noodles is also acceptable.

III. Dilis Powder

According to last year's insecticidal experience, one tael of Dilis powder, one tael of soybean flour, mixed with twelve catties of clean water, is also very effective in treating red spiders.

The most important aspect of curing red spiders is to take action as early as possible. It is hoped that all localities will firmly grasp this point.

    治火＠的办法
    华北农场  杨清政
    据调查，刻下察省建屏专署的平山、灵寿、行唐，有部分地方棉花、豆棵、瓜棵、茄棵上已开始发生了火＠（红蜘蛛）。
    去年晋察冀边区农业推广队，在平汉路北段，防治火＠曾用过以下三法，经验证明效果很好，今分别介绍如下：
    一、石灰硫磺合剂
    制法：用硫磺一斤，研成细粉，将生石灰半斤粉开，放在一起混合均匀后，陆续加水八斤＠熬，一面＠一面不停的搅，约经一小时上下，等药变成了赤褐色（深土经色）就算成功了。煮成后约得八斤原液，不够时加水凑足。用时每原液一斤对水一百斤，杀虫效率百分之百。注意：１、＠时不可用铜锅，不可中止搅拌。２、保存时加油数滴，用蜡封口，不可使之与空气接触。３、保存时若有了结晶（有了渣子），可以生热溶化后再用。
    此法杀虫效率高，价钱很便宜，用时不择天气。去年推广队在曲阳管头村一带推广，颇获农民欢迎。为便利老乡们应用，可经合作社或农场集体配制，按定价出卖药水（原液），使老乡买到药水对上冷水一化就能用。
    二、稀面糊水
    制法：用细白面一斤，加水八斤，打成稀面糊，打好后再加冷水二斤搅拌。使用时，每斤再加入清水八斤，搅拌均匀后即可使用。另法，先用白面一斤加冷水二斤化成糊糊，然后用八斤开水徐徐加入，随倒随搅，充分搅匀，这种配法的火候容易掌握，配水方法同上。
    用法：在晴天太阳光强烈的时候，把面糊水喷到长了火＠的庄稼叶子上，不到一个歇晌的工夫，就把火＠①虫子干死到叶上了。
    去年唐县七区白沙村马老敬的半亩西瓜火＠，就是用这个法子治过的。
    注意：１、打面糊的火候掌握很重要，熬的过火了容易结成块，太生了没有效力。２、阴天喷治不好，要在晴天。３、用吃了白面剩下的面汤也行。
  三、地力斯粉
    依照去年的除虫经验，一两地力斯药面，一两黄豆面，对清水十二斤，治火＠也非常有效。
    治火＠有一个最重要的环节，就是及早下手，这一点望各地紧紧掌握。
