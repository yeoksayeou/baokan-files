Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 27th (via TASS, New York, August 24th): American newspapers continue to publish news indicating that the looming economic crisis is increasingly affecting the US economy.

　　**Sharp Drop in Commodity Sales**

    The New York Times, citing materials from the Federal Reserve Board, proves that department store sales in all twelve districts under the Federal Reserve System have fallen sharply. According to published materials, the unchanged value of department store sales in all regions decreased by 16 percent in the week ending August 13 compared to the same week last year, and by 13 percent in a month compared to the same month last year. In some of the largest industrial centers in the United States (New York, Boston, Cleveland), sales fell by more than 20 percent.

    The Wall Street Journal analyzes the reasons for this decline in trade, pointing out that it is the result of reduced production and the resulting unemployment.

    According to a recent report by the President's Council of Economic Advisers, production in all industrial sectors fell by 13 percent from October-November 1948 to July 1949, with a 10 percent drop occurring in the shorter period from March to July this year. The report points out that the reduction in production has led to a decrease in national income.

　　**Industrial Production Accelerates Decline**

    In some industrial sectors in the United States, the rate of production reduction has greatly exceeded the decline in overall industrial production. A table in the Economic Advisory Committee's report shows that during the period from October 9, 1948, to July of this year, the production of non-ferrous metallurgy and non-ferrous metals fell by 33 percent, engineering production fell by 23 percent, steel production fell by 22 percent, and timber and wood product production fell by 20 percent. Overall, heavy industrial production in the first six months of 1949 decreased by 16 percent compared to the period of October-November 1948. There has also been an almost equally drastic decline in the production of consumer "non-durable goods." The average drop in this industrial sector during the same period was 12 percent, with the rubber industry falling by 29 percent, textiles falling by 32 percent, leather and leather goods falling by 25 percent, and chemical products falling by 12 percent.

    Thus, the decline in production has largely extended to the entire heavy industry that forms the foundation of the entire economy.

    Railway transportation has also declined sharply. According to materials from the New York Times, the weekly freight volume of trains in August decreased by 18.3 percent compared to the same week last year.

　　**Agricultural Production Declines**

    Agricultural production is also declining. Farmers' income in the second quarter of 1949 decreased by 14.7 percent compared to farmers' income in the fourth quarter of 1948. In addition, the difference between the prices of agricultural products and the prices of industrial products is becoming increasingly large, which is detrimental to farmers. For example, according to a bulletin published by the Federal Reserve Board, in July 1949, the prices at which farmers sold their products fell by 14 percent compared to last year, while the prices at which farmers purchased goods fell by only 2 percent. Barron's Financial Weekly reported on August 22 that the Department of Agriculture had warned farmers that the government would further "painfully" cut US agricultural exports.

    The reduction in industrial production and the decline in trade have led to a sharp drop in capital investment. The Economic Advisory Committee's report pointed out that during the period from October 1948 to July 1949, capital investment fell by 26 percent, from $43 billion to $32 billion.

　　**Six Million Unemployed**

    According to official statistics, the number of unemployed people in the United States is increasing steadily. Official materials released by the Department of Commerce show that in August, the number of unemployed people in the United States was 4,095,000. However, materials released by several labor unions have made significant corrections to the government's statistics. For example, the Electrical Workers Union, affiliated with the CIO, released a report on August 8 stating that official statistics underreported the actual number of unemployed by 1.8 million, and in reality, the total number of unemployed people in the United States was 5.9 million.

    According to various newspapers, the situation in the US labor market is particularly unfavorable for women and young people, especially for recent college and university graduates. In December 1948 and January 1949, 885,000 women lost their jobs. The Christian Science Monitor recently reported that out of the 1,200 women who worked at the Bethlehem Steel plant during the war, only one remains. Half of this year's college and university graduates have not found jobs and have joined the ranks of the unemployed. The report released by the Economic Advisory Committee also acknowledges this. The natural increase in the labor force in the labor market is about one million people, who are currently not being absorbed by industry and agriculture.

    According to materials provided by the Federal Social Security Administration, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in early August was as high as 2,517,000. Newspapers point out that unemployment is particularly severe in the eastern states of the United States. According to statistics from the Federal Social Security Administration, the number of unemployed people in Rhode Island in June accounted for 22 percent of all insured workers. The New York Times recently reported that, according to a statement by Connecticut Governor Bowles, one in three workers in the state is unemployed.

    The increase in unemployment has caused concern within the government. Not long ago, Treasury Secretary Snyder made a special trip across the country to investigate the situation on the ground. After his trip, he submitted an economic report to Truman's economic advisor, Steelman, stating that in twelve regions across the country, 12 to 30 percent of all workers are unemployed. These regions are referred to as "disaster areas."

　　**Workers More Impoverished**

    Despite the "overproduction" of goods, consumer prices continue to rise due to the monopolistic practices of trading companies. Although there have been some price reductions, these price reductions are mainly wholesale prices and have little impact on consumer prices. The unofficial publication "Business Trends" says that in the first and second quarters of this year, the cost of living index not only did not fall, but even rose somewhat. According to materials released by the Department of Commerce, the retail price index for consumer goods in June rose due to food prices increasing by 10 to 50 percent. According to reports, 29 cities in the United States raised food prices in July. The New York Times said that in the week ending August 12, the total index of prices for major commodities rose by 2.4 points. The commodities that rose in price included coffee, leather, butter, sugar, etc.

    The middle-income and low-income classes are becoming more impoverished, while at the same time, corporate profits continue to increase.

　　**Capitalists Make a Fortune**

    The CIO's "1949 National Economic Policy" report reveals that the profits of 300 large companies in the first quarter of 1949 increased by 9 percent compared to the same period last year. The profit comparison ratio (i.e., the ratio of corporate profits to the cost required to produce those profits) also increased sharply. The materials cited in the report indicate that corporate interest rates have reached an unprecedented high - 18 percent of the cost of production. For example, General Motors' profits reached 28 percent, and Studebaker Corporation's (whose chairman is Marshall Plan executor Hoffman - editor) exceeded 30 percent. The profits of thirty-eight steel companies increased by 66 percent this year compared to last year.

    The Department of Commerce recently reported that in June 1949, the profits distributed to shareholders of large companies increased by 13 percent, reaching 826 million yuan, compared to 728 million yuan a year ago. The report points out that corporate exploitation of workers has greatly intensified. In the first quarter of this year, corporate income reached 37 percent of the total wages paid by these companies to workers and employees. The report says that it appears that companies can earn a profit of almost four jiao for every yuan they pay to workers.

    As stated in the CIO report, the wealth of the United States is concentrating in the hands of an increasingly narrow group.

### 美生产剧降失业严重　经济危机遍袭工农业各部门

　　美生产剧降失业严重
  　经济危机遍袭工农业各部门
    【新华社北平二十七日电】塔斯社纽约二十四日讯：美报继续刊登表明正在迫近的经济危机日益影响美国经济的消息。
  　商品售量骤减
    纽约时报援引联邦准备局的材料证明联邦准备系统下所有十二个地区的百货商店销售量，均猛烈下跌。根据已经发表的材料，一切地区的百货商店的销售量，在到八月十三日为止的一周内其不变价值较去年同周减少了百分之十六，在一个月内，比去年同月减少了百分之十三。在美国某些最大的工业中心（纽约、波士顿、克里夫兰），售货量下跌了百分之二十以上。
    华尔街日报分析这种贸易下跌的原因，指出：这是减少生产和由此而来的失业所造成的结果。
    根据总统经济顾问委员会最近发表的报告，一切工业部门中的生产，在从一九四八年十月、十一月到一九四九年七月为止的一段期间，降落了百分之十三，其中在从今年三月到七月为止的一段比较短的时期内，生产就降落了百分之十。报告指出：生产的减少已经造成国民收入的降低。
    工业加速减产
    在美国某些工业部门中，减产的速度已经大大地超过整个工业生产的下降。经济顾问委员会报告中的表格显示：在从一九四八年十月九日到今年七月为止的期间，非铁冶金和非铁金属的生产下跌了百分之三十三，工程生产下跌了百分之二十三，钢生产下跌了百分之二十二，木材与木器生产下跌了百分之二十。整个算来，在一九四九年头六个月中的重工业生产，与一九四八年十月——十一月期间相比，减少了百分之十六。在消费者的“非耐用物品”的生产中，也出现了几乎同等剧烈的下降。这一工业部门在上述同一期间的跌落，平均为百分之十二，橡皮工业跌落了百分之二十九，纺织品跌落了百分之三十二，皮革与皮货跌落了百分之二十五，化学物品跌落了百分之十二。
    这样，生产的减退大体上已扩及作为全部经济基础的整个重工业。
    铁路运输也急剧下降。据纽约时报的材料，八月份火车的每周载运量，较去年同周下降了百分之十八点三。
    农业生产降低
    农业生产也在下降。一九四九年第二季农人的收入，较一九四八年第四季农民的收入，下降百分之十四点七。此外农产品价格与工业品价格间的差额，愈来愈大，这是对农民有害的。例如，据联邦准备局发表的公报，一九四九年七月，农民出售产品的价格，较去年下降百分之十四，同时农民购买物品的价格，则仅下降百分之二。拜龙金融周刊在八月二十二日报导称，农业部曾向农民警告说：政府将进一步“忍痛”削减美国农产品的输出量。
    工业生产的减少及贸易的衰萎，已造成资本投资的急剧下降。经济顾问委员会的报告中曾指出，在一九四八年十月至一九四九年七月期间，资本投资下降百分之二十六，自四百三十亿美元下降至三百二十亿美元。
    失业者六百万
    据官方的统计数字，美国的失业人数是在节节增加。商业部公布的官方材料显示，在八月份，美国的失业人数为四百零九万五千。但若干工会发表的材料，则对政府的统计数字，有了很大的修正。例如，属于产联的电气工人工会曾在八月八日发表一项报告，指出官方统计数字较实际失业人数少报了一百八十万，实际上，美国全部失业人数为五百九十万。
    据各报透露，美国劳动力市场的情况，对于妇女及青年，尤其对于新自大学专科学校毕业的学生，是特别不利的。在一九四八年十二月及一九四九年一月，有八十八万五千个妇女失掉职业。基督教科学箴言报最近报道称，战时在伯利恒炼钢厂做工的一千二百个妇女，现在仅仅剩下了一个。本年度大学和专科学校毕业生有一半人没有找到工作，而加入了失业的行列。经济顾问委员会公布的报告也承认这一点。在劳动力市场中劳动大军的自然增加，约达一百万人，这些人目前事实上未被工农业所吸收。
    据联邦社会安全局所提供的材料，在八月初，领取失业救济的人数，多达二百五十一万七千人。各报指出，失业现象尤以美国东部各州为甚。据联邦社会安全局统计，罗得岛六月份失业人数，占全部保险的工人的百分之二十二。纽约时报最近报道称，据康涅狄格州州长波尔斯的声明，该州每三个工人中就有一个人失业。
    失业的增加，引起了政府方面的忧虑。不久前财长史奈德曾特别旅行全国，就地考察情况。他旅行后向杜鲁门经济顾问斯蒂尔曼提出一个经济报告说：全国有十二个区，全体工人有百分之十二至百分之三十失业。这些区被称为“灾区”。
    劳动者更贫困
    尽管商品已经“生产过剩”，但由于贸易公司的垄断手段，消费品价格仍继续在上涨。虽然物价也有某些降低，但是这些物价的降低主要是批发的价格。对消费品价格则很少影响。非官方刊物“商情报道”说：今年第一季与第二季，生活费指数不仅没有下落，而且甚至有某些上升。根据商务部发表的材料，六月份消费品的零售价格指数，因食品价格提高百分之十至百分之五十而上升。据报载，在七月，美国有二十九个城市提高了食品价格。纽约时报说：在到八月十二日为止的一周中，主要商品的价格总指数上升了二·四点。涨价的商品包括咖啡、皮革、牛油、糖等等。
    收入中等和收入低微的阶层更趋贫困，而与此同时，公司的利润继续不断的增加。
    资本家大发财
    产联的“一九四九年国家经济政策”报告透露：三百家大公司一九四九年第一季的利润较去年同期增加了百分之九。利润比较量（即公司所得利润与生产这些利润所需的成本的比率）也急剧增加。该报告中所引的材料，说明公司利率已达空前高的数字——为生产成本的百分之十八。例如，通用汽车公司的利润达百分之二十八，司登贝克汽车公司（该公司的董事长则为马歇尔计划执行人霍夫曼——编者）超过了百分之三十。三十八家钢铁公司的利润，今年比去年增加了百分之六十六。
    商务部不久前报告：一九四九年六月，大公司股票持有人所分到的利润增加了百分之十三，达八亿二千六百万元，一年前为七亿二千八百万元。报告指出公司对工人的剥削大为加紧。今年第一季，公司的收入达到这些公司付给工人和职员的工资总数的百分之三十七。报告说，这样看来，公司每付给工人一块钱，几乎就可以得到利润四角。
    如产联报告中所说，美国全国的财富正在向一群越来越狭小的集团手里集中。
