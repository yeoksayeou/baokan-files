[News from this city] The fourth day (12th) of the All-Circles Representatives Conference of Beijing Municipality primarily focused on discussing the takeover and administrative work reports of the Beijing Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government over the past six months. After heated discussions by all representatives throughout the day, unanimous satisfaction and acceptance were expressed, and a resolution regarding the municipal report was passed. A total of forty-two representatives spoke at the meeting that day, expressing extreme indignation towards the sabotage of social order and production construction in Beijing by Kuomintang reactionaries, special agents, and bandits, as well as the hoarding and speculation by profiteering merchants, which disrupted finance, prices, and affected the lives of citizens. They unanimously demanded that the People's Government continue to thoroughly eliminate special agents and bandits, suppress the destructive activities of all counter-revolutionary elements, and severely punish speculative merchants. Student Union representative Duan Baolin pointed out: "Eliminating special agents and bandits is an indispensable condition for restoring and developing production." Industry and Trade Union representative Qiu Fangyu proposed strengthening anti-espionage and anti-profiteering propaganda, forming propaganda organizations to cooperate with public security organs in carrying out the registration of members of reactionary parties. Representatives believed that the current price fluctuations were mainly due to speculation, profiteering, and hoarding by profiteering merchants, and unanimously demanded that the municipal authorities severely punish these merchants. Representatives also put forward many valuable opinions on further developing production, advocating thrift, supporting the front lines, and developing culture and education. Gan Jixian from the 70th Ordnance Factory, Ma John from the Joint Association of College and University Faculty and Staff, Yang Baojun from medical workers, and Zhuang Zhihui from industrial workers proposed that the government should carry out worker education, social education, and promote sports. Women representative Yu Ruqi suggested that the government should strengthen childcare work and establish more childcare institutions to solve the practical difficulties faced by female workers and women cadres and staff in participating in work. Railway worker representative Yang Kaiwen, industrial worker representative Zhuang Zhihui, Mentougou Coal Mine worker representative Xiao Bo, 70th Ordnance Factory worker representative Gan Jixian, postal worker representative Song Fengxiang, and private textile and dyeing industry female worker representative Wang Shixiu spoke one after another, pointing out that building a new Beijing requires restoring and developing production. Railway worker representative Yang Kaiwen said: "We workers must unite with people from all walks of life, actively produce, and overcome the current difficulties. We workers must respond to the call to develop production with practical actions." Zeng Zhaolun, representative of the Beijing branch of the China Democratic League, Li Minxin, representative of the preparatory committee of the Beijing branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, and Wang Dalu, representative of the Beijing Organizing Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, emphasized the importance of developing production, streamlining, and practicing economy in their speeches. Industrial representatives Pu Jiexiu and Ling Qijun proposed that the government should provide more planned leadership and assistance to the production of private industries.

The representatives spoke extremely enthusiastically, exceeding the original allotted time. The presidium discussed and extended the time several times, truly achieving a situation where everyone spoke their minds and said everything they knew.
