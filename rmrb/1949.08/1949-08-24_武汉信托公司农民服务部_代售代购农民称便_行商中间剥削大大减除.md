　　Wuhan Trust Company's Farmers Service Department
　　Convenient Sales and Purchases for Farmers
　　Greatly Reducing Exploitation by Traveling Merchants
　　[Hankou News] The Wuhan Municipal Trading Company's Trust Company Rural Service Department officially opened on the 7th of this month. The main business of the department is: 1. To sell, purchase, or store agricultural products transported and sold by farmers' cooperatives on their behalf; 2. To purchase goods needed by farmers or farmers' cooperatives on their behalf. During the preparation period, the department had initially established prestige among the broad masses of farmers. At that time, new grain was being harvested, and the supply of grain was abundant. Farmers and transporters were eager to sell, but the market was sluggish. In order to solve this problem, the department temporarily used grain stores to purchase on its behalf. From July 12th to the beginning of this month, it had purchased or sold on behalf of farmers 700,488.5 jin of millet, 1,966,881.5 jin of wheat, as well as glutinous rice, triple-milled rice, soybeans, etc., with a total value of approximately 300 million RMB. No fees were charged for anything. The department also exchanged 100 baskets of matches and 20 dan (100 jin per dan) of brown sugar for the farmers. In the past, under normal circumstances, when farmers delivered grain and sold it through grain stores, for every dan (138 jin) of grain sold, in addition to paying a commission of 4%, they also had to pay digging fees, sewing fees, scale-watching fees, and entertainment fees, totaling more than 516 RMB. There were also excessive exploitation practices such as "judging the appearance," pressing the scales, and underpricing the purchase. Now, when the Rural Service Department sells agricultural products on behalf of farmers, it charges a handling fee of 0.5%, which is less than the commission charged by the stores. The department also educated the bag-sewing workers, etc., so that they voluntarily reduced the digging, sewing, and other fees by one-half. Therefore, in the future, farmers who directly entrust the Rural Service Department to sell on their behalf, based on the current price of 13,000 RMB per dan, can save 517 RMB, and there are no other miscellaneous fees. Therefore, farmers are happy to sell their agricultural products to the department.

　　武汉信托公司农民服务部
    代售代购农民称便
  　行商中间剥削大大减除
    【汉口讯】武汉市贸易公司信托公司农村服务部已于本月七日正式营业。该部之主要业务为：一、代售、收购或代存农民合作社运销之农产品；二、代购农民或农民合作社所需之物品。该部在筹备期间已在广大农民间初步建立了威信，当时适逢新谷登场，来粮充裕，农民及贩运商急欲脱售，而市场滞售，该部为解决此问题，乃暂时通过粮行，代为收购，从七月十二日到本月上旬，业已收购或代售谷子七十万零四千八百零八斤半，小麦一百九十六万六千八百八十一斤半及齐米、三道机米、黄豆等总值约三亿元人民币；一切费用都未取，其中并给农民换回一百篓火柴，二十担（每担一百斤）红糖。按过去一船情况农民上粮，通过粮行代卖时每卖出一担（一百三十八斤）粮，除了要支付行佣百分之四外，还支付挖包费、缝包费、看秤的、招待费折合人民币共计五百一十六元余，其他还有“看样子”、压秤、压价收购等超额剥削。而现在农村服务部，代售农民农产品时，按千分之五手续费，比行店的行佣少。该部并教育了缝包工人等，使他们自动减去挖包、缝包等费二分之一，因此今后农民直接委托农村服务部代售者，按现在每担一万三千元计算，可少支五百一十七元，其他一切杂费都没有。因此，使农民都乐于向该部出售农产品。
