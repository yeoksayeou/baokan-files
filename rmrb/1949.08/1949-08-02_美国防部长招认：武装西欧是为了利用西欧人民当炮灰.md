　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st: TASS, Washington dispatch: On July 29th, U.S. Defense Secretary Johnson, while testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, continued his efforts to persuade certain congressmen to accept the government's plan to arm Western Europe and other countries. In order to allay the fears of the congressmen, Johnson asserted that the United States would not send troops to Europe to use the equipment supplied by the United States to other countries, which means that the "cannon fodder" would be entirely provided by Western European countries. Johnson admitted that the United States now holds the military secrets of Western European countries. The requests made by these countries to the United States "include classified and precise intelligence that we are entrusted to keep. These requests indicate the number and organization of these countries' armies, as well as the extent of their current equipment, etc." In answering questions, Johnson vehemently rejected any suggestions for international disarmament that might be achieved through the United Nations. He said: "I am deeply skeptical of all disarmament negotiations."

    美国防部长招认：武装西欧是为了利用西欧人民当炮灰
    【新华社北平一日电】塔斯社华盛顿讯：七月二十九日，美国防部长詹森在众院外委会作证时，继续努力劝说某些众议员接受政府武装西欧及其他国家的计划。詹森为了平息议员们的恐惧，断言美国不会把军队送到欧洲去使用美国供给他国的装备，这就是说，“炮灰”要完全由西欧国家来充当。詹森承认，美国现在握有西欧国家的军事秘密。这些国家向美国提出的请求中，“包括托我们保管的分类精密的情报。这些请求表明这些国家军队的数量及其编制，以及它们现在装备的程度等。”詹森在答复问题时，极力拒绝关于任何可能经由联合国达成国际裁减军备的建议。他说：“我对于一切裁减军备的谈判深表怀疑。”
