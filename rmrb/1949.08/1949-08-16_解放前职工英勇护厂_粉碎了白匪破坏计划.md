　　Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 15th: Before liberation, the workers of Changsha heroically defended the city's public enterprises, thwarting the pre-liberation White Bandit Chongxi's plan to plunder and destroy. On the 18th of last month, when White Bandit Chongxi fled Changsha, under the so-called "scorched earth" policy of plunder, he ordered the Changsha Telecommunications Bureau, Post Office, and Highway Bureau to dismantle all machinery and materials and move them to Hengyang. The workers of each bureau immediately organized themselves under the slogans of "Machines are life, we will never let the bandits take them away" and "Actively prepare to welcome tomorrow", launching a struggle against relocation and sabotage. Workers in each bureau organized spear teams to patrol day and night, preventing bandit and secret agent sabotage. At the same time, they actively dismantled, dispersed, and concealed equipment. Workers at the Telecommunications Bureau packed over one hundred tons of good equipment overnight, dispersing and hiding it in the suburbs and workers' dormitories, leaving only some old machines to maintain operations. When the White bandits sent people to urge them, the workers stalled for time by saying they were "dismantling and packing." Finally, when the White bandits were helpless and wanted to send troops to destroy it, the bureau's workers cleverly packed up years of accumulated scrap iron and let them transport it away. Highway Bureau workers completely disassembled nearly one hundred vehicles, burying all the important parts. As a result, only a field of broken car bodies remained, making it impossible for the bandits to seize and use them. Post Office workers also organized a fire brigade to protect materials and archives. After the news of Changsha's peaceful liberation spread, this group of heroic workers who had dismantled and dispersed the machines quickly carried out restoration work. All Highway Bureau workers spent three nights assembling thirty vehicles. The Telecommunications Bureau immediately sent two repair teams to repair the Changsha-Yueyang and other lines that had been destroyed by the White bandits. The Post Office, despite the difficulty of not having buses or ships, took turns carrying letters to various liberated areas.

　　解放前职工英勇护厂　粉碎了白匪破坏计划
    【新华社长沙十五日电】长沙职工在解放前英勇地保卫该市公营事业，粉碎了解放前白匪崇禧掠夺和破坏的计划。上月十八日白匪崇禧逃出长沙时，在所谓“空室清野”的掠夺政策下，下令长沙电讯局、邮政局、公路局拆卸全部机器和资材，向衡阳迁移。各局职工立即在“机器就是生命，决不让强盗搬走”、“积极准备，迎接明天”的口号下，自动组织起来，展开反迁移、反破坏的斗争。各局职工都组织有标枪队，日夜巡逻，防止匪特破坏。同时积极拆卸、疏散和隐蔽器材。电讯局的职工将一百多吨好器材，连夜包装起来，疏散和隐藏到市外和职工宿舍里去，只留下一些破旧机器坚持工作。当白匪派人催促时，职工们就推说“正在拆卸包装”来拖延时间。最后，当白匪无可奈何，要派部队前来破坏时，该局职工便又机敏地将多年所存的废铁包装起来，让其运走。公路局职工则将近百辆汽车完全拆卸开，把重要机件悉数埋藏起来。结果只剩下满场的破车皮，使匪徒们无法抢走和利用。邮政局职工并组织有消防队来保护物资档案。当长沙和平解放的消息传出后，这批英勇的进行拆卸疏散机器的职工们就又迅速地进行恢复工作。公路局全体职工三夜赶装了三十辆汽车。电讯局立即派出了两个抢修队，去抢修被白匪破坏的长（沙）岳（阳）等线路。邮政局在没有班车班轮的困难情况下，就轮班挑运地向解放区各地递送信件。
