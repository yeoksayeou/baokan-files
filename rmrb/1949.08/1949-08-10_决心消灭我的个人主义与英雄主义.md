    Determined to Eliminate My Individualism and Heroism
    Li Geng
    My family used to be landlords. The year I was born, they went bankrupt and split up, becoming poor peasants. My father died when I was five, and my grandfather was an unemployed merchant. When I started school at nine, my grandfather often told me, "Study hard so you can become a high official and earn money in the future!" He also said, "Grandpa is waiting for you to make money so he can enjoy life!" My mother also taught me, "If you study well, people will praise you, and bring the money home!" This kind of family education had a great influence on me. Back then, studying and later working were all based on the idea of making money and getting rich. I dropped out of school at fifteen due to difficult family circumstances. At sixteen, I went to Shenyang Tianzengshun Foreign Goods Wholesale Shop as an apprentice, with the ambition of making money. In the first half year, I felt it was too hard and making money was difficult. There were thirty or forty people above me, and I wondered, "When will I ever become a manager?" But because I didn't have the ability, I could only muddle along, focusing on learning how to make money. During this period, I learned to flatter people, go with the flow, only say nice things, work superficially, slack off behind people's backs, speak based on who I was talking to and what the situation was, not seeking truth, not offending anyone, and striving to be smooth. Half a year later, due to these skills of mine, I was indeed promoted to manage the goods, and later assigned to be a traveling salesman (selling goods on the streets). At this time, not only was it necessary to flatter people, but even more necessary to be hypocritical and deceitful, saying the goods were good and cheap to outsiders, and saying the goods were of low quality and expensive internally. A year later, I was promoted again to the accounting desk as a clerk. The accounting desk was the main part of the business. Those with a lower status than me could be bossed around at will. If they didn't please me, I would use the excuse of "money being important" to prevent them from coming to the accounting desk, and wouldn't give them money, creating all sorts of difficulties for them. In short, once I had a bit of ability and knew more about things, I put on airs and became arrogant and conceited, a "hero." During this period, I came into contact with completely hypocritical, deceitful, arrogant, flattering, smooth, and selfish profiteers, and I became familiar with this set of behaviors. Later, I went to Futeng Chemical Factory as an accountant, with the goal of earning more money. There were thirty or so male and female workers in the factory, and I naturally looked down on them. In front of the manager, I was extremely diligent and tried my best to please him. But I was very harsh to the workers, reducing their wages, with the aim of consolidating my position, fantasizing about becoming a capitalist in the future. After the Japanese surrender, I switched to the grain business, specializing in speculative trading. I was promoted from accountant to experienced buyer. During this stage, it was all about mutual deception, which further strengthened my individual heroism and habits of hypocrisy, deceit, intrigue, and striving for smoothness. The consciousness of the exploiting classes became even stronger in my mind, and of course I wouldn't understand class struggle. Worker strikes, in my opinion at that time, were illegal. If you didn't have money, you should work for people and accept your suffering. At that time, I also thought that although the Kuomintang was corrupt, we businessmen could still speculate and do business. If we were lucky, we could get rich and become capitalists. At this time, I was blinded by the desire to get rich. Although advanced friends had advised me and I had read progressive books, my thinking had not progressed. Last year, I lost my job. At this time, my dream of getting rich suffered a severe blow, and I became indignant at the injustice of the old society. As a frustrated person in the old society, looking at progressive books again was somewhat different from before. After the liberation of Tianjin, due to my own frustration and dissatisfaction with my family and marriage, I came to apply for Revolutionary University. Before applying to Revolutionary University, I originally wanted to apply for the southbound work group to get far away from home, but when I saw that the learning time for the southbound work group was only one and a half months, I thought, what could I learn in such a short time? I should still apply to Revolutionary University to study for four months, learn some advanced theories, and then boast to others and raise my status when I went out to work in the future. This way I could make the family look good, and also take care of my relatives. After entering the school, after studying the current situation, I realized the strength of the world's people, and also learned that the United States was a declining imperialist power, sweeping away the fear of America in my past thinking. In terms of life, getting up early and going to bed late was a bit uncomfortable, but I quickly got used to it. When listening to Comrade Huang Jing talk about the issue of worldview, recalling my past obsession with wealth and my attempt to become a capitalist, it was simply a shameful and ridiculous dream! In particular, studying the history of social development educated me even more. I learned about labor creating the world and the laws of class struggle and social development. I understood the mistakes in my past view of the working people. Worker strikes were class struggles, struggles against oppression and exploitation. The Communist Party serves the people wholeheartedly. I further learned that the poverty of the working people was entirely caused by the exploitation of the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. Thinking of my family's poverty in my childhood, and the suffering and exploitation I experienced in business, and recalling my arrogant attitude after becoming an accounting clerk, I felt very ashamed and very sad! I had accepted some revolutionary theory, but the bad ideas and work styles I had been stained with for a long time in the old society still seriously remained. For example, when I was a group leader, I only wanted to show off and not be looked down upon by my classmates, so I tried my best to show my ability, using hypocrisy and smoothness to win over my classmates. During criticism sessions, I adopted an attitude of not offending anyone, never strictly criticizing anyone. When others criticized me, I also dealt with it in a smooth and hypocritical way, neither accepting and correcting nor raising objections, thinking to myself that it was okay to suffer a little "grievance." If disagreements arose, the other groups would laugh at us, and would also say that the group leader's leadership was not good. Because of vanity and saving face, I couldn't help my classmates progress. When classmates wanted to play while studying, I didn't advise or criticize them, adopting an irresponsible attitude. Because I thought that his not studying didn't hinder me, why should I care about him? As long as I make progress in my studies, that's good! After the class advisor pointed out these selfish and individualistic thoughts, I realized that it was a big mistake, so I gradually corrected myself, but because the old habits were too deeply ingrained, I didn't do enough. When building the Youth League, I thought I was qualified enough, but I looked down on the old Youth League members and was unwilling to take the initiative to ask them to be my introducers, hoping that they would take the initiative to ask me. I actively studied, worked hard, and showed them, my mind was completely filled with this aloof and arrogant heroic thinking. Due to these endless erroneous behaviors of mine, in the work of the student representative meeting, my classmates criticized me for having the "style of a foreign county magistrate." After carefully examining myself, I indeed had the air of a "guide." This is a work style of being detached from the masses. I am now determined to start eliminating individual heroism. The learning in February has made me more clearly aware of myself. I want to strive for the help of my classmates and am determined to eliminate these two enemies: individualism and heroism, establish a firm revolutionary worldview, serve the people wholeheartedly, obey the organization's allocation of work, never violate discipline, obey the interests of the masses, sacrifice personal interests, not be afraid of hardship, no matter how high or low the position, no matter when or where, determined and sincerely fight for the revolution to the end. Especially since I have been honorably approved to be a member of the New Democratic Youth League, I must be even more determined to carry out the tasks of the League and strive to join the Party in the future.

    决心消灭我的个人主义与英雄主义
    李耕
    我家从前是地主成份，在我初生那年，破产分家变为贫农，五岁父亲故世，祖父是个失业商人，我九岁入学，祖父常常对我说：“好好念书，将来好当大官，赚钱！”又说：“爷爷就等着你赚钱时好享福啊！”母亲也教训我：“学好有人夸，赚钱往家拿！”这样的家庭教育给我影响很大，那时的念书，后来的作事，都是以赚钱发财为出发点。十五岁因家庭环境困苦而失学，十六岁抱着以赚钱的志向到沈阳天增顺洋货批发庄当学徒，头半年感到太苦，赚钱很难，上边有三四十个人，我想，“什么时候才能当上掌柜的呢？”但因为自己没有能力，只好敷衍，一心想学赚钱的方法。在这一个期间我学会了奉承人，顺风转舵，净说好听的，明面干活，背后偷懒，看人看势说话，不求真理，不得罪人，力求圆滑。半年后，由于自己这套本领，果然便被提升管理货物，后来又派为跑外柜（走街卖货），这时不但需要奉承人，更需要虚伪欺骗，对外说货好价廉，对内说货次价高。一年以后，又升到帐桌子上当先生，帐桌子是买卖的主要部分，比自己身份低的，可以随便支使，如不讨我的欢心，就以“金钱重地”为名阻止他不许到帐桌上来，还会不支给他钱，给他们种种为难，总之有点能力了，事情也知道的多了，便摆起架子骄傲自大，“英雄”起来了。在这一段落，所接触的，完全是虚伪、欺骗、骄傲、奉承、圆滑自私自利的奸商，自己也就熟悉了这一套。后来又到福登化学工厂当会计员，目的是想多赚几个钱。工厂中有三十多个男女工人，我当然看不起他们，在经理面前，我是大献殷勤，极力讨好，对工人则非常刻薄，减低工资，目的是为了巩固我的地位，幻想将来也成个资本家。日本投降后，改作粮业，专作投机买卖。我由会计员升任买卖货物老客，在这一阶段中，完全是尔虚我诈，更加强了我的个人英雄和虚伪欺骗、钩心斗角力求圆滑的习气。剥削阶级的意识在我脑子里越发加强，当然就不会理解阶级斗争。工人罢工，在我那时看来是不合法的，没有钱就应给人家劳动，受苦应认命。那时我还认为国民党虽然贪污腐化，我们作买卖的却有投机的事情可做，碰巧就能够发财，成个资本家。这时我被发财迷了心窍，虽有先进朋友劝过我，进步的书籍我看过，但是思想并没进步。在去年我失业了。这时我发财的梦，遭到严重的打击，才激愤于旧社会的不平，这时作为一个旧社会的失意人再看看进步书籍，就多少有点儿和以前不同了。天津解放后，由于自己的失意情绪和对家庭婚姻不满，我才来考革大。考革大前，我本想考南下工作团离家远远的，但看到南下工作团学习时间为一个半月，我想这样短的时间，能学到什么，还是考革大学习四个月，学些高深的理论，将来出去工作以便夸耀于人，提高自己的地位，将来能壮门面，对亲戚也有一个照顾。入校后，经过学习目前形势，我知道了，世界人民力量的强大，也知道美国是个日趋没落的帝国主义，一扫过去思想上的恐美病。在生活方面早起晚睡，有点不好受，但后来很快的也习惯了。听黄敬同志讲人生观问题时，回想我过去的财迷思想，妄图当资本家，简直是又可耻又可笑的梦！特别是学习社会发展史，对我的教育更大，我知道了劳动创造世界和阶级斗争、社会发展的规律，明白了过去对劳动人民看法的错误，工人罢工运动，就是阶级斗争，反压迫反剥削的斗争，共产党是全心全意为人民服务的，更知道劳动人民的贫困，完全是地主阶级与官僚资产阶级的剥削所造成的。想起幼年家中贫困，和在商家所受的苦与被剥削的情形，又想起自己当了管帐先生后，摆起那臭架子情形，心里非常惭愧，非常难过！革命理论是接受一些了，但是长期在旧社会沾染的恶劣思想、作风还严重的残存着，如在当小组长时，我光想露一手，使同学不能小瞧我，所以尽力显露自己能干，用虚伪、圆滑，拉拢同学。检讨会时，采取不得罪人的态度，从未严格的批评过人，别人批评我，我也以圆滑虚伪的手段对之，既不接受改正，也不提出反对，自己认为受点“委屈”算了。如发生意见，被别组看见多笑话，又要说组长领导不好，为了虚荣心，爱面子，所以我不能帮助同学进步。学习时，同学爱玩就玩，我也不劝告、不批评，采取不负责任的态度。因我认为他不学习与我没有妨碍，何必管他呢，只要我学习进步就行啦！这些自私自利的个人主义的思想，经过班主任指示，自己才觉悟到是一个大错误，于是才逐渐改正，但由于过去的积习太深，作的还不够。在建团的时候，自己以为很够条件，但是我看不起老团员，就不愿主动找他们当介绍人，希望他们来主动找我，我积极学习，努力工作，表现给他们看看，心理完全是这样清高自大的英雄思想。由于我这些层出不穷的错误表现，在学代会工作中，同学批评我有“洋县长派头”，我详细检讨了一番，确有“指导者”的派头，这是脱离群众的作风，我现在决心开始肃清个人英雄主义。二月来的学习，使我较清楚的认识了自己，我要争取同学的帮助，决心消灭这两个敌人：个人主义，英雄主义，树立起坚定的革命人生观，全心全意为人民服务，服从组织分配工作，决不违犯纪律，服从群众利益，牺牲个人利益，不怕艰苦，不论职位高低，不论何时何地，决心的真诚的为革命奋斗到底，尤其我已光荣的被批准为新民主主义青年团员，更要决心执行团的任务，争取将来入党。
