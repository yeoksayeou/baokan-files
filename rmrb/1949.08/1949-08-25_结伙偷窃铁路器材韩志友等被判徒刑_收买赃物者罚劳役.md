　　[This article reports on the sentencing of a gang of thieves who stole railway equipment and the sentencing of a person who received the stolen goods.]

　　【Our Newspaper's Report】The Peiping Municipal People's Court recently sentenced thieves who stole railway equipment to imprisonment. The thieves, Han Zhiyou and thirty to forty others, between February and March, in Gaolou Village, Tuchengzi, Fenghuangzui and other places, under the instigation of Cao Dazhuang, Han Zhiyou, and Dong Yuhai, stole thirty-four steel plates scattered beside the railway. They hired Hu Lianjiang's carts and the carters Xiao Chunlai transported them four times, and Ma Wenlu transported them once, selling them to merchants Chen Yanling and others, and dividing the money among themselves. On April 1st, they gathered more than thirty people, with two carts, and went to the east of Fengtai Station, loaded eleven steel plates scattered near Dongxinlou onto the carts and pulled them away. The station troops pursued and captured the two carts carrying the steel plates and the carters Xiao Chunlai and Ma Wenlu. The Pingjin Railway Public Security Section sent the thieves to the court for trial.
    After a detailed trial, based on some materials from the Suburban Fourth Branch Bureau, the People's Court, considering that Han Zhiyou and others directly damaged the interests of the state and violated the provisions of the Eight Chapters of the Provisional Law, gave appropriate punishments according to their roles as principals and accessories. The masterminds Han Zhiyou and Cao Dazhuang were each sentenced to five years imprisonment; the other seven accomplices Wang and others were sentenced to three and a half years imprisonment or six months of labor service respectively. The merchants Chen Yanling, Qi Zhen, and Sang Xiangcheng, were greedy for petty gains and purchased stolen public property, which was originally unforgivable. However, considering that they were all first-time offenders, they were leniently sentenced to six months of labor service and ordered to publish a public apology in the newspaper. Hu Lianjiang, greedy for money, provided carts for the thieves to transport steel plates as many as four times, which should have been severely punished. However, considering that he assisted in solving the case afterward and captured most of the criminals, offsetting his crime with his merit, he will not be held responsible, but he will still be required to publish a public apology in the newspaper. The remaining uncaptured criminals are being pursued.

    人民法院根据郊四分局一部分材料，经详细审讯后，以韩志友等直接损害国家利益，触犯约法八章的规定，乃分别首从，给以相当惩处。主谋韩志友、曹大庄各处徒刑五年；其他王、从犯七人分别处徒刑三年半或劳役六个月不等。商人陈彦龄，齐振、桑湘成，贪图便宜，收买窃来公家器材，原无可恕，姑念其均系初犯，从宽处劳役六个月，并令其登报公开认错。户连江贪财好利以大车供给窃犯拉运钢板达四次之多，本应从严惩罚，姑念其事后协助破案将人犯大部捕获，将功折罪，不再追究其责任，但仍要其公开登报认错。其余未捕获案犯正追缉中。
