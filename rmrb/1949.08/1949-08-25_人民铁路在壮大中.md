Because of rapid military advances, the enemy fled in panic, and railway employees spontaneously rose to protect railway property, resulting in less damage to the People's Railway. The main focus of work at present is taking over and emergency repairs. Although some places suffered particularly severe damage by the enemy, such as all the bridges on the Yuehan Line from Wuchang to Puqi being severely damaged, they have been quickly repaired and opened to traffic thanks to the active repairs by railway workers.
　　The original length of the Southern Railways (including Taiwan and Hainan Island) was 7,401 kilometers and 897 meters. As of the end of July, 2,573 kilometers and 855 meters have been liberated. Currently, 1,594 kilometers and 725 meters of the People's Railway are open to traffic.

　　Northern Railways
　　This year's main tasks are the emergency repair of damaged lines and the restoration of opened lines.

From January to July this year, 2,423 kilometers and 309 meters have been repaired (including 707 kilometers and 50 meters repaired before April 15th).
