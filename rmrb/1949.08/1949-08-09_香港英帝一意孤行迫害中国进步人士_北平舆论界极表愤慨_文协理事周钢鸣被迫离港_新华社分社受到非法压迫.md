    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 8th: Hong Kong Dispatch: Zhou Gangming, Standing Director of the Hong Kong Literary Association, has been forced to leave Hong Kong because on July 21st, the Hong Kong British government suddenly, without any reason, ordered him to leave the territory within a limited time. This is the first persecution of Hong Kong progressives by the Hong Kong British government since the promulgation of the so-called "Societies Registration Ordinance" on May 25th and the search of Fang Fang's residence on June 13th. This matter has aroused widespread indignation in Beijing, just as it has in Hong Kong. Another attack by the Hong Kong government on progressives occurred on the 4th of this month, when the Hong Kong British government issued a warning to the completely legal Hong Kong branch of this agency because the branch had published General Yuan Zhongxian's statement on the escape of the Amethyst on the 3rd, and the agency's short commentary on the same incident. The Hong Kong British government warned that if the Hong Kong branch of this agency engages in any further so-called slanderous behavior, the government will take "appropriate action." Public opinion in Beijing points out that the Hong Kong British government is acting willfully, disregarding the protection afforded by the Chinese People's Government to law-abiding British nationals in China, and implementing arbitrary oppression against Chinese residents in Hong Kong. The British government and British public opinion should consider what kind of repercussions this situation will have.

    香港英帝一意孤行迫害中国进步人士
    北平舆论界极表愤慨
    文协理事周钢鸣被迫离港
    新华社分社受到非法压迫
    【新华社北平八日电】香港消息：香港文艺协会常务理事周钢鸣被迫离开香港，因为上月二十一日香港英政府突然毫无理由地命令他限期出境。这是香港英政府在五月二十五日颁布所谓“社团注册条例”，六月十三日搜查方方住宅以后对于香港进步人士的第一次迫害。此事在北平已引起和在香港一样广泛的愤慨。香港政府对进步人士另一次进攻发生在本月四日，香港英政府向完全合法的本社香港分社提出警告，因为本社的分社在三日发布了袁仲贤将军关于紫石英号逃走的声明和本社对同一事件的短评。香港英政府警告称：如本社香港分社再有所谓毁谤行为，则该政府将采“适当行动”。北平的舆论界指出：香港英政府一意孤行，不顾中国人民政府对于在华英国守法侨民的保护，而对香港中国居民实行专横的压迫，此种情形将发生何种反响，这是英国政府和英国人民舆论所应当考虑的。
