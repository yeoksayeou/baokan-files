    The Political Foundation of the People's Democratic System (Conclusion)

  The Main Tasks of the People's Democratic State
    Through the organs of people's power and the new state apparatus, the people's democratic state can smoothly realize the functions of the dictatorship of the proletariat and complete the tasks it faces.
    What are these tasks?
    When talking about the main tasks of the Soviet state, Comrade Stalin once pointed out that the main tasks of the Soviet state in the first stage (from the October Revolution to the elimination of the exploiting classes) were: to suppress the overthrown classes at home, to defend against foreign aggression, to improve the economic organization work of the new socialist economic base, and the cultural and educational work of re-educating the people in the socialist spirit.
    In the first stage, the latter task was not fully carried out.
    The central task of the Soviet state today is to build communism. There is no longer any need for the security and suppression organs to engage in activities against domestic reactionaries.
    The people's democratic state is in the first stage of development, which is equivalent to the period of transition from capitalism to socialism. This stage is characterized by the intensification of class struggle in cities and villages. The people's democratic state is successfully carrying out the main tasks of this stage.
    As a state in the period of transition from capitalism to socialism, the people's democratic state is developing forward under conditions of acute class struggle. Even after the working class has seized power and grasped the main means of production, and after the banks have been nationalized, the exploiting classes still possess considerable power in agriculture, commerce, and urban small production.
    The people's democratic state is a tool for the proletariat to wage class struggle against the exploiters. It forcibly suppresses all attempts by the bourgeoisie to hinder the development of socialism and destroys the plans of the agents of Anglo-American imperialism to restore the capitalist system. In the struggle against the restoration attempts of capitalists and landlords, the people's democratic state is supported by the broad masses of the people. The trials of the special agents such as Osni, Pop, Buccioc in Romania, Mindszenty in Hungary, and similar conspirators in Czechoslovakia and Poland, demonstrate that as long as the people are vigilant, the enemies of the people's democratic state—traitors, spies serving imperialism, and saboteurs—have no chance of success.
    The proletariat of the people's democratic state is using state power to eliminate the exploiting classes and build socialism, gradually destroying and restricting the economic foundations of the exploiters, and eliminating them as a class. The property of bankers, industrialists, and other capitalists has been expropriated. The land plundered by the landlords has been confiscated, and they have been eliminated as a class. In the countryside, the people's democratic state is implementing a policy of restricting and gradually eliminating capitalist elements—the rich peasants.
    The people's democratic system is thus using the power of the state to realize the functions of the dictatorship of the proletariat.
    The administrative, organizational, and cultural-educational work of building socialism is one of the most important and arduous tasks of the people's democratic state. Thanks to the assistance of the Soviet Union, the people's democratic state can carry out this work to a considerable extent even in the first stage, because it does not have to engage in civil war or military intervention against imperialism. In addition to the enormous organizational work necessary to build a socialist economy, there is also an important task, namely, to re-educate the people in the socialist spirit. The proletariat—the most advanced class in society—seizing power does not mean that the workers have completely shaken off the influence of the bourgeoisie. The more arduous task is to educate the working people in the urban petty bourgeoisie and peasants, who account for the majority of the population of the people's democratic state, and to absorb them into actively working in the state power.
    The People's Representative Council can most fully realize this task, because they represent all the people in cities, villages, and factories.
    Promoting people's love for the Soviet Union is one of the main tasks of education.
    The decision on the national question adopted by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party states, "Love for the Soviet Union—the birthplace of socialism—and a resolute struggle against any anti-Soviet manifestations is the yardstick and touchstone of proletarian internationalism, the main guarantee of the prosperity and happiness of the people's democratic state, and it means strengthening one's own freedom and national independence."
    The working class is the leading force in the people's democratic system, which is fully embodied by the People's Representative Council. Experience proves that the leading role of the proletariat in the state, political, economic, and cultural life of the people's democratic states is the main condition for their transition to socialism. There is no other way.
    The Tito-led group of Yugoslav traitors and betrayers, in order to drag Yugoslavia into the imperialist camp, first reduced the role of the Yugoslav proletariat and disarmed the proletariat ideologically and politically in the face of the enemy.
    The vile purpose of the Titoists is to conceal their betrayal of joining the ranks of imperialism from the Yugoslav people. That is why Tito and his partners superficially pretend to be very close to the proletariat, loudly proclaiming socialist words and slogans, and mixing all this with their reactionary nationalist formulas. In fact, these agents of Anglo-American imperialism are taking measures to restore the capitalist system. They think they can discredit socialist theory in the eyes of the Yugoslav people and drag Yugoslavia into the imperialist camp.
    In this Trotskyite trickery, the Tito group is also trying to discredit the dictatorship of the proletariat—which does not actually exist in Yugoslavia. What the Tito group is implementing is not the dictatorship of the proletariat, but a nationalist, terrorist dictatorship against the proletariat and its fundamental interests. Yugoslavia is no longer a people's democratic state, and the Tito group should be held responsible for this.
    The main ally of the working class is the working peasantry. This policy of alliance with the working peasantry is of particular importance to the people's democratic state, which is laying the foundation for socialism. The worker-peasant alliance led by the working class is the main principle of the people's democratic state. This worker-peasant alliance led by the working class can be fully realized through the People's Representative Council, because this form of political power organization is the most convenient, and it stipulates the joint participation of all working people in the work of state power under the leadership of the working class and its vanguard—the Marxist-Leninist party.
    The People's Representative Council is the embodiment of the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class and a fighting alliance between the proletariat and the working peasantry.
    However, the composition and organization of the People's Representative Council itself cannot guarantee that their work will necessarily be socialist in nature. This guarantee can only be obtained when they are led by the revolutionary party of the proletariat, nurtured by the great doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. In the Soviet Union, only the leadership of the Bolshevik Party enabled the Soviet of Laboring People's Representatives to have socialist content. Throughout the history of socialist Soviet Union, the leadership of the Bolshevik Party over the Soviets illustrates the great role of the Soviets in building socialism in the past and building communism today. The great experience of Soviet construction inspires the Communist and Workers' Parties of the people's democratic countries to struggle for the building of socialism.
    Our party is carrying out persistent work to develop and strengthen the provisional committees of the People's Representative Council. Moreover, the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party has pointed out to all party organizations that if the party organizations do not help the People's Representative Council to develop independently, but instead take over and hinder their initiative, we will commit serious errors.
    The essence of the party's leadership over the new organs of power lies in the working people's recognition of the party's leading role, in the party's prestige and love among the masses of the people, and also in the fact that in the history of the people's democratic state, the exploited and oppressed masses have never had a party that they wholeheartedly support.
    In order to lead the people to successfully carry out the struggle for the realization of socialism, and to achieve the ideological and political unity of the working people, the Marxist-Leninist party must constantly strengthen the People's Representative Council—the political foundation of the people's democratic state.

    人民民主制度的政治基础  （续完）

  人民民主国家的主要任务
    人民民主国家通过人民政权机构和新的国家机器，能够顺利实现资产阶级专政的职能，和完成它面临的任务。
    这是些什么任务呢？
    在谈到苏维埃国家的主要任务时，斯大林同志曾经指出，苏维埃国家第一阶段（自十月革命到消灭剥削阶级期间）的主要任务是：镇压国内已被推翻的阶级，防御外国的侵略，提高新的社会主义经济基础的经济组织工作和以社会主义精神再教育人民的文化教育工作。
    在第一阶段，后一项工作并未能充分开展。
    苏维埃国家今天的中心任务是建立共产主义。保卫机关与镇压机关不必再作什么对付国内反动势力的活动了。
    人民民主国家正处在发展的第一阶段，即相当于从资本主义过渡到社会主义的时期。这一阶段的特征是城市和乡村中阶级斗争的尖锐化。人民民主国家正顺利地实现着这一阶段的主要任务。
    作为从资本主义过渡到社会主义时期国家的人民民主国家，正在尖锐的阶级斗争的条件下向前发展着。甚至在工人阶级取得政权和掌握了主要的生产手段以后，在银行已经国有化以后，剥削阶级还仍然在农业、商业和城市小生产中占有相当势力。
    人民民主国家是无产阶级对剥削者进行阶级斗争的工具。它以强力镇压资产阶级阻碍社会主义发展的一切企图，摧毁英美帝国主义代理人阴谋恢复资本主义制度的计划。人民民主国家在和资本家及地主的复辟企图进行斗争中，得到广大人民的支持。对罗马尼亚的奥斯尼，波朴，布交和匈亚利的明增蒂等特务分子，以及对捷克与波兰的同类的阴谋分子的审判，可以说明只要人民提高警觉，人民民主国家的敌人——卖国贼、为帝国主义服务的间谍和破坏分子——是丝毫无成功的可能的。
    人民民主国家的无产阶级正在运用国家政权去消灭剥削阶级和建立社会主义，正在逐渐摧毁和限制剥削者的经济基础，把他们作为一个阶级消灭掉。银行家、工业家和其他资本家的财产已经被剥夺了。地主掠夺来的土地被没收，并且作为一个阶级来说，他们已被消灭了。在乡村，人民民主国家实行着限制和逐渐消灭资本主义分子——富农——的政策。
    人民民主制度正这样运用国家的权力实现无产阶级专政的职能。
    建设社会主义的行政、组织和文化教育工作，是人民民主国家最重要、最艰巨的任务之一。由于苏联的援助，人民民主国家甚至在第一阶段就可能把这个工作进行到相当程度，因为它可以不必进行内战或对帝国主义的军事干涉作战。除了建立社会主义经济所必须的巨大组织工作而外，还有一件重要的工作，即是用社会主义精神再教育人民。无产阶级——社会上最先进的阶级——取得政权，并不等于说工人已经完全摆脱了资产阶级的影响。更艰巨的任务是教育占人民民主国家人口大半的城市小资产阶级和农民中间的劳动人民，把他们吸收到国家政权中来积极工作。
    人民代表会议可以最完满地实现这个任务，因为他们代表着城市、乡村和工厂的全部人民。
    发扬人们热爱苏联的感情，是教育工作的主要任务之一。
    罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会政治局所通过的关于民族问题的决定说，“热爱苏联——社会主义的诞生地——和对于任何反苏的表现进行坚决的斗争，是无产阶级国际主义的标尺和试金石，是人民民主国家繁荣与幸福的主要保证，它意味着增强自己的自由和民族独立。”
    工人阶级，是人民代表会议所充分体现的人民民主制度中的领导力量。经验证明，无产阶级在人民民主国家的国家、政治、经济和文化生活中的领导作用，是它们过渡到社会主义的主要条件。此外没有别的道路。
    以铁托为首的南斯拉夫卖国贼和叛徒集团，为了想把南国拖进帝国主义阵营，他们首先就降低南斯拉夫无产阶级的作用，和在敌人面前解除无产阶级思想上和政治上的武装。
    铁托党徒卑劣的目的，是想在南斯拉夫人民面前掩饰它们投到帝国主义行列中去的叛卖行为。这就是为什么铁托及其伙伴们在表面上装得极靠近无产阶级，高嚷社会主义的言辞和口号，把这一切和他们的反动的民族主义公式混同起来。实际上，这些英美帝国主义的代理人正在作恢复资本主义制度的措施。他们以为能在南斯拉夫人民的眼中使社会主义学说丧失威信，将南斯拉夫拖到帝国主义阵营里去。
    在这种托洛茨基分子的诡谲的把戏中，铁托集团也企图使无产阶级专政丧失威信，——无产阶级专政在南斯拉夫实际上是不存在的。铁托集团实行的不是无产阶级专政，而是反对无产阶级及其根本利益的民族主义、恐怖主义专政。南斯拉夫不再是人民民主的国家了，这是铁托集团应该负责的。
    工人阶级的主要联盟者是劳动农民。这个与劳动农民联盟的政策，对于正在奠立社会主义基础的人民民主国家，是有特别的重要性的。工人阶级领导的工农联盟是人民民主国家的主要原则。这种工人阶级领导的工农联盟，可以通过人民代表会议完满实现，因为这种政权组织形式是最便利的，它规定了在工人阶级及其先锋队——马列主义的政党——领导下，一切劳动人民共同参与国家政权工作。
    人民代表会议是工人阶级领导的、无产阶级和劳动农民的战斗联盟之体现。
    可是，人民代表会议的组成与机构本身，还不能保证他们的工作就一定是社会主义性质的。只有当他们受马、恩、列、斯的伟大学说所培育的无产阶级的革命政党的领导时，才能得到这种保证。在苏联，曾只有布尔塞维克党的领导，才使劳动人民代表苏维埃有了社会主义的内容。在社会主义苏联的全部历史中，布尔塞维克党对苏维埃的领导，说明了苏维埃在过去建立社会主义及今天建立共产主义中的巨大作用。苏联建设的伟大经验鼓舞着人民民主各国共产党和工人党建立社会主义的奋斗。
    我们的党正进行着坚持不懈的工作，发展和加强人民代表会议的临时委员会。而且，罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会已向全党各组织指出，如果党组织不帮助人民代表会议独立发展，而去包办代替和妨害他们的主动性，我们就犯了严重的错误。
    党对新的政权机关的领导，它的实质在于劳动人民承认党的领导作用，在于党在人民大众中享有威信和受到爱戴，还在于以下这一事实，即在人民民主国家历史上，被剥削被压迫群众从来不曾有过这样一个受他们全心拥护的政党。
    为了要领导人民顺利进行为实现社会主义的奋斗，和要获得劳动人民思想上和政治上的团结，马列主义的政党必须经常加强人民代表会议——人民民主国家的政治基础。
