　　Vigorously Develop Production and Construction
  　Order from the North China People's Government and Military Region
  　Cancellation of Wartime Service Mobilization Methods
    Wartime Service Organizations at All Levels Except Village Level to be Cancelled; Temporary Retention of Substitute Farming Service and Public Grain Voluntary Transportation Methods
    [Ping City News] In view of the complete liberation of the North China region, and in order to vigorously develop production and construction in the future, the North China People's Government and the North China Military Region Headquarters jointly issued an order on August 19th to cancel the wartime service mobilization methods. The original text of the order is as follows:
    The North China region has been completely liberated. The wartime services undertaken by the people of North China in the past to support the front lines have gloriously completed their historical mission. In the future, we should vigorously develop production and construction. Therefore, it is hereby decided that the wartime service mobilization methods previously promulgated by various provinces and districts, except for the substitute farming service and the voluntary transportation method for public grain storage, which will be temporarily retained, all others will be cancelled from October, and specific regulations are as follows:
    1. The original wartime service organizations at all levels, except for the village service cadres who will be retained, all others will be cancelled. All wartime service files will be transferred to the government finance departments for acceptance, and clear handover procedures will be carried out. The cadres will be assigned separately by the government at each level.
    2. The transportation of ordnance, ammunition, provisions, clothing, hygiene and medicine, telecommunications equipment, etc., and the transfer of hospitals, etc., will be handled by the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region, which will first prepare a budget and pay the transportation costs. If too much manpower is required (for loading and unloading trains, ships, and entering and leaving warehouses, etc.) and it is difficult to hire, a letter of introduction from the North China Military Region or the secondary military region should be presented to the local city and county governments for consultation, and the method of requisitioning and hiring should be adopted at market prices (transportation costs should still be paid according to regulations), and the city and county governments should issue temporary orders.
    3. The provincial governments will prepare and report budgets for the honorary soldiers and the coffins of martyrs, and hire laborers to transport them.
    4. The substitute farming service in the villages will continue to be implemented in accordance with the local village substitute farming methods until the government promulgates new measures.
    5. For the storage of public grain during the collection stage, if the transportation distance does not exceed one hundred li round trip, it will still be transported voluntarily by the masses. If the round trip exceeds one hundred li, the excess part must be paid for transportation costs, and detailed methods will be formulated separately.
    6. If public grain already stored in the warehouse needs to be dried again, the district or branch warehouse should submit a request to the local government to adopt a method of requisitioning and hiring at market prices.
    7. For letters sent through the post office, the district and village postal organizations should be improved to ensure prompt delivery, and no wartime service should be used under any circumstances.
    8. In the event of temporary casualties (regardless of party, government, military, civilian, or students), the village or district office may be responsible for hiring someone to transport them. The transportation wages should be certified by the person themselves, advanced by the county government, and reported to the province for expenditure within the provincial reserve fund.
    9. After the cancellation of wartime service, the collection of wartime service grain will also be stopped, and all localities should immediately clear and report it.
    It is hoped that all localities will earnestly implement the above!

  　华北人民政府及军区命令
  　取消战勤动员办法
    各级战勤机构除村级外一律取消代耕勤务及公粮义运办法暂保留
    【平市讯】华北人民政府及华北军区司令部鉴于华北地区已完全解放，今后为求得大力开展生产建设，特于八月十九日联合发布命令，取消战争勤务动员办法，该令原文如下：
    华北地区已完全解放，我华北人民过去为了支援前线所担负的战争勤务，已经光荣地完成历史任务，今后则应大力开展生产建设。因此，兹特决定将过去各省、区公布之战勤动员办法，除代耕勤务以及公粮入库时之义运办法暂予保留外，其余一律自十月份起取消，并作具体规定如下：
    １、原有各级战勤机构，除将村勤务干部保留外，其余一律取消，所有战勤案卷，均移交政府财政部门接收，并清楚办理移交手续，其干部由各该级政府另行分配。
    ２、军械弹药、粮秣被服、卫生医药、电讯器材等的运输，及医院转移等，均由华北军区后勤部，先造预算，开支运费，倘因需用人力过多（于装卸火车、轮船、出入库等）难以雇到时，持华北军区或二级军区介绍信与当地市县以上政府协商，按市价采取征雇办法（仍应按规定开支运费），由市县以上政府临时以命令行之。
    ３、荣誉军人和烈士灵枢，由各省政府造报预算，雇脚转送。
    ４、村中代耕勤务，在本府未颁布新办法前，仍按各地村代耕办法执行。
    ５、公粮在征收阶段的入库，其输送距离，往返不超过一百华里者，仍由群众义务运输，往返超过一百华里者，其超过部分，须开支运费，详细办法另订之。
    ６、公粮已经入库，须再翻晒时，由区分库呈请当地政府，按市价采征雇办法。
    ７、凡经邮局邮递之信件，应健全区村邮政机构，迅速转送，一律不准动用勤务。
    ８、临时发生的伤病员（不管党政军民学），可由村或区公所负责代雇转送，转送工资得本人证明，由县政府垫支上报，在省预备费内开支。
    ９、战争勤务取消后，战勤米征收亦即停止，各地应即清理上报。
    以上务希各地切实执行为要！
