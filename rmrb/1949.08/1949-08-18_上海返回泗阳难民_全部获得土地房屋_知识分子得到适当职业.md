　　Shanghai Returnees to Siyang

  　All Receive Land and Housing

  　Intellectuals Obtain Suitable Employment
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 17th] More than 8,300 refugees, escaped landlords, and rich peasants returning from Shanghai to Siyang County, Northern Jiangsu, have been properly resettled by the county's People's Government. They have all obtained a means of livelihood, land to cultivate, and houses to live in, settling down and living in peace. As for the small number of landlords and rich peasants who oppressed the peasants, as long as they mend their ways and engage in production, the local people and government will treat them with leniency. The People's Government also helps intellectuals among the returnees to find suitable employment, and more than 200 of them have already joined local education work. The People's Government is currently persuading and educating those individual landlords and idlers who do not engage in production and rely solely on government and people's relief, helping them to reform.

　　上海返回泗阳难民
  　全部获得土地房屋
  　知识分子得到适当职业
    【新华社上海十七日电】由上海返回苏北泗阳县的八千三百多难民和逃亡地主、富农，已得到该县人民政府妥善安置。他们都已获得生活出路，有地种，有房住，安居乐业。对少数欺压过农民的地主、富农，只要他们改过自新，进行生产，当地人民和政府也均予宽大处理。人民政府对回乡难民中的知识分子并代其介绍适当职业，其中已有二百余人参加地方教育工作。对个别不事生产，专依赖政府和人民救济的地主、懒汉，人民政府则正在说服教育，帮助其改造。
