    Discard Illusions, Prepare for Struggle

    The publication of the U.S. White Paper at this time is no accident. It reflects the victory of the Chinese people and the failure of imperialism. It reflects the decline of the entire imperialist world system. The internal contradictions of the imperialist system are numerous and insurmountable, plunging them into extreme distress.

    Imperialism has prepared the conditions for its own demise. The masses of the people in colonial and semi-colonial countries and the masses of the people in the imperialist countries themselves are such conditions. Imperialism drives the masses of people all over the world onto the historical stage of the great struggle to eliminate imperialism.

    Imperialism has prepared both material and spiritual conditions for these masses. Factories, railways, guns, etc., are material conditions. The powerful material equipment of the Chinese People's Liberation Army comes mostly from American imperialism, partly from Japanese imperialism, and partly from its own manufacture.

    Since the British invasion of China in 1840, followed by the French war against China, the Anglo-French allied invasion of China, the Eight-Power Allied invasion of China by Britain, France, Japan, Tsarist Russia, Germany, the United States, Italy, and Austria, the Japanese war against China, the war between Japan and Tsarist Russia on Chinese territory, the Japanese invasion of China's Northeast provinces that began in 1931, the Japanese invasion of the whole of China that began in 1937 and lasted for eight years, and finally, the recent three-year war of aggression against China that was ostensibly led by Chiang Kai-shek but actually led by the United States. In this last war, the U.S. government's White Paper states that U.S. material assistance to the Nationalist government accounted for "more than 50 percent of the Nationalist government's monetary expenditure," and that, in the military sphere, it supplied "the bulk of the military supplies" to the Nationalist government. This was a war in which the United States provided money and guns, Chiang Kai-shek provided the men, and they fought for the United States and killed Chinese people. All these wars of aggression, coupled with political, economic, and cultural aggression and oppression, have created the Chinese people's hatred for imperialism, made the Chinese think about what is really going on, and forced the Chinese spirit to be developed, to unite in struggle, to struggle, to fail, to struggle again, to fail again, accumulating 109 years of experience, accumulating experience from hundreds of struggles, large and small, military and political, economic and cultural, bloody and bloodless, before finally achieving today's fundamental success. This is the spiritual condition; without this spiritual condition, the revolution cannot be victorious.

    For the sake of aggression, imperialism created the comprador system and bureaucratic capital in China, and thereby created imperialism's antithesis—the Chinese national industry and the Chinese national bourgeoisie, and especially the Chinese proletariat working in enterprises directly operated by imperialism, in enterprises of bureaucratic capital, and in enterprises of the national bourgeoisie. For the sake of aggression, imperialism exploited Chinese peasants through unequal exchange, causing the peasants to go bankrupt, and created hundreds of millions of poor peasants, who accounted for 70 percent of the rural population. For the sake of aggression, imperialism created millions of new-style intellectuals, both large and small, who were different from the old-style literati or scholar-officials. Of these people, imperialism and its running dog, the reactionary Chinese government, could only control a part, and later, only a very small number, such as Hu Shih, Fu Sinian, and Qian Mu. They could not control the others; they went to its opposite. Students, teachers, professors, technicians, engineers, doctors, scientists, writers, artists, and civil servants all rebelled, or were unwilling to follow the Kuomintang any longer. The Communist Party is a poor party, and it has been widely and pervasively propagated by the Kuomintang as a party of murderers, arsonists, rapists, looters, people without history, without culture, without a motherland, without filial piety, without respect for teachers, unreasonable, practicing communal ownership of wives, using human-wave tactics—in short, a group of people with green faces and fangs, who are utterly wicked. However, the strange thing is that such a group has won the support of hundreds of millions of people, including the support of most intellectuals, especially young students.

    Some intellectuals still want to take a look. They think the Kuomintang is bad, but the Communist Party may not be good either; they want to wait and see. Some of them verbally support, but in their hearts they are watching. It is these people who harbor illusions about the United States. They are unwilling to distinguish between the American imperialist elements in power and the American people who are not in power. They are easily deceived by certain sweet words of the American imperialist elements, as if without serious and prolonged struggle, these imperialist elements will talk to the people's China about equality and mutual benefit. Many reactionary, that is, anti-people, thoughts still remain in their minds, but they are not Kuomintang reactionaries; they are the middle or right wing of the people's China, apart from the Kuomintang reactionaries. They are the supporters of "democratic individualism" mentioned in Acheson's White Paper. Acheson's deceptive practices still have a thin social foundation in China.

    Acheson's White Paper indicates that American imperialists are helpless about the current situation in China. The Kuomintang is so incompetent that no matter how much help is given, it is destined to collapse. They cannot control it; they are helpless. Acheson said: "The unfortunate but inescapable fact is that the unfortunate outcome of the Chinese civil war is beyond the control of the U.S. government. The United States has done or could do within the reasonable limits of its capabilities, but it cannot change this outcome. What the United States has not done has no effect on this outcome. This is the product of internal forces in China. The United States has also tried to influence these forces, but it has been ineffective."

    Logically, Acheson's conclusion should be in accordance with the thinking or saying of some confused people in China, "Lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha," give the people's China equal and mutually beneficial treatment, and no longer engage in sabotage. But no, Acheson said that sabotage is still necessary, and definitely necessary. What will be the effect? It is said that there will be some. On what group of people will they rely? It is the supporters of "democratic individualism." Acheson said: "China's long-standing civilization and democratic individualism will eventually triumph again, and China will eventually overthrow the foreign system. I think we should encourage all developments in China that are working now or in the future to achieve the above goals." (⑴⑶)

    The logic of the imperialists is so different from the logic of the people. Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until extinction—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world; they will never violate this logic. This is a Marxist truth. When we say "imperialism is very vicious," we mean that its nature cannot be changed. Imperialist elements will never lay down the butcher knife, nor can they become Buddhas, until their demise. Struggle, fail, struggle again, fail again, until victory—this is the logic of the people; they will never violate this logic either. This is another Marxist truth. The Russian people's revolution once followed this truth, and the Chinese people's revolution is now following this truth.

    Class struggle, some classes are eliminated, and some classes triumph. This is history; this is thousands of years of civilization. Explaining history from this point of view is called historical materialism; standing on the opposite side of this point of view is historical idealism.

    The method of self-criticism can only be used within the people. It is impossible to hope to persuade the imperialists and Chinese reactionaries to have good intentions and turn back from the wrong path. The only way is to organize forces and fight them, such as our People's Liberation War, the land revolution, exposing imperialism, "stimulating" them, overthrowing them, and sanctioning their illegal acts, "only allowing them to be well-behaved, not allowing them to talk and act recklessly." Only then is there hope to deal with foreign imperialist countries on an equal and mutually beneficial basis. Only then is there hope to give the landlords, bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and Kuomintang reactionaries and their accomplices who have been disarmed and surrendered education to turn from bad people into good people, and turn them into good people. Many Chinese liberals, that is, old democrats, that is, the so-called "democratic individualism" supporters whom Truman, Marshall, Acheson, and Stuart Leighton belong to and often try to win over, often fall into a passive position and their observations on problems are often incorrect—their observations on the American rulers are often incorrect, their observations on the Kuomintang are often incorrect, their observations on the Soviet Union are often incorrect, and their observations on the Chinese Communist Party are also often incorrect, precisely because they do not have or do not approve of using the method of historical materialism to look at problems.

    Advanced people, Communists, democratic parties, conscious workers, young students, progressive intellectuals, have the responsibility to unite the middle strata within the people's China, the middle-of-the-roaders, the backward elements in all strata, all those who are still wavering and hesitant (these people will continue to waver for a long time, becoming firm and then wavering again, wavering whenever they encounter difficulties), to help them with good intentions, to criticize their wavering, to educate them, to strive for them to stand on the side of the people, not to let imperialism pull them over, to tell them to discard illusions and prepare for struggle. Do not think that because you have won, you do not need to do work. You still need to do work, you still need to do a lot of patient work, to truly win over these people. If you win them over, imperialism will be completely isolated, Acheson's set of tricks will have no place to be used, the victory of the Chinese people can be consolidated, the work of national construction can be carried out smoothly, and difficulties such as blockade, floods, unemployment, inflation, and rising prices can be easily overcome.

    The slogan "Prepare for struggle" is addressed to those who still harbor certain illusions on the issue of relations between China and imperialist countries, especially the issue of relations between China and the United States. They are still passive on this issue, have not yet made a decision, and have not yet made a resolution to engage in a long-term struggle with American imperialism (and British imperialism), because they still have illusions about the United States. On this issue, there is still a large or considerable distance between them and us.

    The publication of the American White Paper is worth celebrating, because it has poured a bucket of cold water on the Chinese who have old democratic ideas, that is, democratic individualistic ideas, and who do not approve, or do not quite approve, are dissatisfied, or have some dissatisfaction, or even hold antipathy, towards democratic collectivism, or democratic centralism, or collective heroism, or internationalist patriotism, but still have patriotism, and are not Kuomintang reactionaries, and has made them lose face, especially for those who believe that everything is good in the United States and hope that China will learn from the United States.

    Acheson openly said that he wants to encourage China's democratic individualism to win again and overthrow the so-called "foreign system." This means overthrowing Marxism-Leninism, overthrowing the people's democratic dictatorship system led by the Chinese Communist Party, because it is said that this doctrine and this system are "foreign," have no roots in China, and that the German Marx (this person has been dead for sixty-six years), the Russian Lenin (this person has been dead for twenty-five years), and Stalin (this person is still alive) imposed their will on the Chinese people, and that this doctrine and this system are utterly bad, advocating class struggle, overthrowing imperialism, etc., and therefore must be overthrown. This work of "overthrowing," after being "encouraged" by President Truman, Chief Commander Marshall behind the scenes, Secretary of State Acheson (the lovable foreign adult who handled the release of the White Paper), and Ambassador Stuart Leighton, and through the hands of "democratic individualism," is said to "eventually triumph again." Acheson and his ilk think this is doing "encouragement" work, but it is very likely to be regarded by those Chinese who, although believing in the United States but still have patriotism, as a bucket of cold water, making them feel ashamed: not dealing properly with the people's democratic dictatorship authorities in China, but doing these outrageous things, and writing them publicly in the White Paper, shameful, shameful! For those with patriotism, Acheson's words are not an "encouragement," but an insult.

    China is in the midst of a great revolution, and the whole of China is bustling with activity, with good conditions to win over and unite all those who have no deep-seated hatred for the people's revolutionary cause, but have erroneous ideas. Advanced people should use the White Paper to persuade all such people.

### 丢掉幻想，准备斗争

专栏：新华社社论

    丢掉幻想，准备斗争
    美国的白皮书在现在这个时候发表，不是偶然的，它反映了中国人民的胜利和帝国主义的失败。它反映了整个帝国主义世界制度的衰落，帝国主义制度内部的矛盾重重，无法克服，使他们自己陷入了极大的苦闷中。
    帝国主义给自己准备了灭亡的条件。殖民地半殖民地的人民大众和帝国主义自己国家内的人民大众，就是这样的条件，帝国主义驱使全世界的人民大众走上消灭帝国主义的伟大斗争的历史时代。
    帝国主义替这些人民大众准备了物质条件，也准备了精神条件。工厂，铁道，枪炮等等，这些是物质条件。中国人民解放军的强大的物质装备，大部分是从美国帝国主义得来的，一部分是从日本帝国主义得来的，一部分是自己制造的。
    自从一八四○年英国人侵略中国以来，接着就是法国进攻中国的战争，英法联军进攻中国的战争，英国、法国、日本、沙皇俄国、德国、美国、意大利、奥地利等八国联军进攻中国的战争，日本进攻中国的战争，日本和沙皇俄国在中国领土内进行的战争，一九三一年开始的日本进攻中国东四省的战争，一九三七年开始继续了八年之久的日本进攻中国全境的战争，最后是最近三年来表面上是蒋介石实际上是美国进攻中国的战争。这最后一次战争，美国政府的白皮书上说，美国对国民党政府的物质帮助占国民党政府的“金钱支出的百分之五十以上”，其中，在军事方面，供给了国民党政府的“军需品的大部分”，这就是美国出钱出枪蒋介石出人替美国打仗杀中国人的战争。所有这一切侵略战争，加上政治上，经济上，文化上的侵略和压迫，造成了中国人对于帝国主义的仇恨，使中国人想一想，这究竟是怎么一回事，迫使中国人的精神发扬起来，从斗争中团结起来，斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，积一百零九年的经验，积几百次大小斗争的经验，军事的和政治的，经济的和文化的，流血的和不流血的经验，方才获得今天这样的基本上的成功。这就是精神条件，没有这个精神条件，革命是不能胜利的。
    为了侵略的必要，帝国主义给中国造成了买办制度，造成了官僚资本，并因而造成了帝国主义的对立物——造成了中国的民族工业，造成了中国的民族资产阶级，而特别是造成了在帝国主义直接经营的企业中，在官僚资本的企业中，在民族资产阶级的企业中做工的中国的无产阶级。为了侵略的必要，帝国主义以不等价交换的方法剥削中国的农民，使农民破产，给中国造成了数以万万计的贫农大群众，贫农占了农村人口的百分之七十。为了侵略的必要，帝国主义给中国造成了数百万区别于旧式文人或士大夫的新式的大小知识分子。对于这些人，帝国主义及其走狗中国的反动政府只能控制其中的一部分人，到了后来，只能控制其中的极少数人，例如胡适，傅斯年，钱穆之类，其他都不能控制了，他们走到了它的反面。学生，教员，教授，技师，工程师，医生，科学家，文学家，艺术家，公务人员，都造反了，或者不愿意再跟国民党走了。共产党是一个穷党，又是被国民党广泛地无孔不入地宣传为杀人放火，奸淫抢掠，不要历史，不要文化，不要祖国，不孝父母，不敬师长，不讲道理，共产公妻，人海战术，总之是一群青面獠牙，十恶不赦的人。可是，事情是这样奇怪的，就是这样的一群，获得了数万万人民群众的拥护，其中，也获得了大多数知识分子尤其是青年学生们的拥护。
    有一部分知识分子还要看一看。他们想国民党是不好的，共产党也不见得好，看一看再说。其中有些人口头上说拥护，骨子里是看。正是这些人，他们对美国存着幻想。他们不愿意将当权的美国帝国主义分子和不当权的美国人民加以区别。他们容易被美国帝国主义分子的某些甜言蜜语所欺骗，似乎不经过严重的长期的斗争，这些帝国主义分子也会和人民的中国讲平等，讲互利。他们的头脑中尚残留着许多反动的即反人民的思想，但他们不是国民党反动派，他们是除了国民党反动派以外的人民中国的中间派或右派，他们就是艾奇逊白皮书中所说的“民主个人主义”的拥护者，艾奇逊们的欺骗做法在中国还有一层薄薄的社会基础。
    艾奇逊的白皮书表示，美国帝国主义者们对于中国的目前这个局面是毫无办法了。国民党是那样的不行，无论帮它多少总是命定地完蛋了，他们不能控制了，他们无可奈何了。艾奇逊说：“不幸的但亦无法逃避的事实，是中国内战的不幸结果为美国政府控制所不及。美国在它能力的合理限度以内所曾经做过或能够做的，都不能改变这个结果。美国所未做的，对于这个结果也没有影响。这是中国内部势力的产物。这些势力，美国亦曾试图加以影响，但不能有效。”
    按照逻辑，艾奇逊的结论应该照着中国某些思想糊涂的人们的想法或说法，“放下屠刀，立地成佛”，“强盗收心做好人”，给人民的中国以平等和互利的待遇，再也不要做捣乱工作了。但是不，艾奇逊说，还是要捣乱的，并且确定地要捣乱。效果呢？据说是会有的。依靠什么一批人物呢？就是“民主个人主义”的拥护者。艾奇逊说：“中国的悠久文明和民主的个人主义终将再度胜利，中国终将推翻外来制度。我认为我们应当鼓励在中国的一切发展，这些发展在现在或将来都是为了达到上述目标而工作。”（⑴⑶）
    帝国主义者的逻辑和人民的逻辑是这样不同的。捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义及世界上一切反动派的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是一条马克思主义的真理。我们说“帝国主义是很凶恶的”，就是说它的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，直至胜利——这就是人民的逻辑，他们也是决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是马克思主义的又一条真理，俄国人民的革命曾经是依照了这条真理，中国人民的革命现在也是依照这条真理。
    阶级斗争，一些阶级消灭了，一些阶级胜利了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。拿这个观点解释历史的就叫做历史的唯物主义，站在这个观点的反面的是历史的唯心主义。
    自我批评的方法只能用于人民内部，希望劝说帝国主义者和中国反动派发出善心，回头是岸，是不可能的。唯一的办法是组织力量和他们斗争，例如我们的人民解放战争，土地革命，揭露帝国主义，“刺激”他们，把他们打倒，制裁他们的犯法行为，“只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动”，然后才有希望在平等和互利的条件下和外国帝国主义国家打交道，然后才有希望把已经缴械了和投降了的地主阶级，官僚资产阶级和国民党反动派及其帮凶们给以由坏人变好人的教育，并把他们变成好人。中国的许多自由主义分子，亦即旧民主主义分子，亦即杜鲁门，马歇尔，艾奇逊，司徒雷登们所属望的和经常企图争取的所谓“民主个人主义”的拥护者们之所以往往陷入被动地位，对问题的观察往往不正确——对美国统治者的观察往往不正确，对国民党的观察往往不正确，对苏联的观察往往不正确，对中国共产党的观察也往往不正确，就是因为他们没有或不赞成用历史唯物主义的方法去看问题的原故。
    先进的人们，共产党人，各民主党派，觉悟了的工人，青年学生，进步的知识分子，有责任去团结人民中国内部的中间阶层，中间派，各阶层中的落后分子，一切还在动摇游豫着的人们（这些人们还要长期地动摇着，坚定了又动摇，一遇困难就要动摇的），用善意去帮助他们，批评他们的动摇性，教育他们，争取他们站到人民大众方面来，不让帝国主义把他们拉过去，叫他们丢掉幻想，准备斗争。不要以为胜利了，就不要做工作了。还要做工作，还要做很多的耐心的工作，才能真正争取这些人们。争取了他们，帝国主义就完全孤立了，艾奇逊的一套就无所施其技了，中国人民的胜利就可以巩固了，国家建设的工作就可以顺利地进行了，封锁，水灾，失业，通货膨胀，物价上涨等等困难就易于克服了。
    “准备斗争”的口号是对于在中国和帝国主义国家的关系的问题上，特别是中国和美国的关系的问题上尚存有某些幻想的人们说的，他们在这个问题上还是被动的，还没有下决心，还没有和美国帝国主义（以及英国帝国主义）作长期斗争的决心，因为他们对美国还有幻想。在这个问题上，他们和我们还有一个很大的或者相当大的距离。
    美国白皮书的发表是值得庆祝的，因为它给了中国怀有旧民主主义思想亦即民主个人主义思想而对民主集体主义，或民主集中主义，或集体英雄主义，或国际主义的爱国主义，不赞成，或不甚赞成，不满，或有某些不满，甚至抱有反感，但是还有爱国心，并非国民党反动派的人们，浇了一瓢冷水，丢了他们的脸，特别是对那些相信美国什么都好，希望中国学美国的人们浇了一瓢冷水。
    艾奇逊公开说，要鼓励中国的民主个人主义再度获胜，推翻所谓“外来制度”。这就是说要推翻马克思列宁主义，推翻中国共产党领导的人民民主专政的制度，因为据说这个主义和这个制度是“外来”的，在中国没有根的，是德国的马克思（此人已死了六十六年），俄国的列宁（此人已死了二十五年）和斯大林（此人还活着）把他们的意志强加于中国人的，而且这个主义和这个制度是坏透了，提倡什么阶级斗争，打倒帝国主义等等，因此，必须推翻。这种“推翻”的工作，经杜鲁门总统，马歇尔幕后总司令，艾奇逊国务卿（即经手发布白皮书的一位可爱的洋大人）和司徒雷登滚蛋大大使们一“鼓励”，经过“民主个人主义”之手，据说“终将再度胜利”。艾奇逊们认为这是在做“鼓励”工作，但很可能被中国的那些虽然相信美国但是尚有爱国心的民主个人主义者们认为是一瓢冷水，使他们感觉丢脸：不和中国的人民民主专政的当局好好地打交道，却要干这些混帐工作，而且公开写在白皮书上，丢脸，丢脸！对于有爱国心的人们说来，艾奇逊的话不是一种“鼓励”，而是一种侮辱。
    中国是处在大革命中，全中国热气腾腾，有良好条件去争取和团结一切对人民革命事业尚无深仇大恨，但有错误思想的人们。先进的人们就应利用白皮书，向一切这样的人们进行说服工作。    【新华社北平十四日电】
