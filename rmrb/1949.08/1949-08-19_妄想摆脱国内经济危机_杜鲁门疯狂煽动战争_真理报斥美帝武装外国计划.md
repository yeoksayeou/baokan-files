Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th -- TASS, Moscow dispatch: The Pravda international affairs commentator, Malinin, published a commentary entitled "Truman Incites War Madness." Malinin wrote: The U.S. Senate has not even had time to compile the record of the North Atlantic Treaty after a lengthy internal struggle to approve it, and the U.S. President is already asking Congress to quickly approve his plan to arm the signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty.

Just a short time ago, when the State Department formally responded to formal inquiries from certain senators on July 11th, it officially stated that the military assistance plan was not a plan to implement the North Atlantic Treaty. Today, Truman has cast aside the promises he made yesterday and is demanding that Congress urgently approve the plan to arm foreign countries, because this plan is an inseparable and essential component of the North Atlantic Treaty. In order to achieve his goals, Truman does not hesitate to distort the facts and make hostile attacks on the Soviet Union in his message.

Truman said: America's mission is to establish "a world society that enjoys prosperity and security"! Let us uncover his hypocritical clichés and see what the true content of his message is.

What exactly are the so-called basic principles of Truman's plan? The U.S. President once again declared: The United States, by established fact, assumes the sole leadership role in international affairs. When Truman said these words, he carefully avoided a question for obvious reasons: Who exactly agreed to and approved the "transformation" of the United States into some kind of supreme sovereign state in the world? For this supreme sovereign state, international cooperation is just empty talk, and its own demands are supreme law.

Malinin continued: The U.S.'s undisguised ambition to pursue world hegemony, which is the "leadership" that Truman demands, is solely justified by endless talk about the interests of so-called U.S. national security. But what does Truman understand by "national security"? The system of U.S. "national security" as understood by Truman and his State Department is to extend the borders of the United States to Europe, and to establish a network of U.S. military strategic bases on various continents.

Fully consistent with the essence of this plan, Truman issued a demonstrative challenge to the United Nations. According to Truman, the United Nations is currently unable to achieve peace. The only one who can achieve peace is the United States and the U.S. President. The inevitable result of Truman's proposed arms program is to usurp the fundamental powers stipulated in the United Nations Charter and turn the United Nations into a passive spectator of U.S. imperialist tyranny.

Truman's first foreign military aid bill for the 1950 fiscal year requests an appropriation of nearly $1.5 billion, half of which will be allocated from existing U.S. stockpiles and surpluses, and almost all the rest will be newly produced weapons. In this way, it seems that the purpose of the arms program is, on the one hand, to sell outdated weapons, and on the other hand, to provide new orders to many industrial sectors affected by the crisis. Truman's message stubbornly emphasizes that the arms program he proposed is necessary to maintain U.S. international economic programs, especially the Marshall Plan. The State Department's booklet explains what Truman wants to say in his heart. It can be seen from this booklet that the implementation of the arms program is necessary to remove obstacles hindering private U.S. investment in Europe. That is to say, Truman's arms program aims to establish a special system to facilitate a greater offensive by U.S. monopoly capital against the economies of many countries in Europe, Asia, and the Western Hemisphere. Truman's plan stipulates that under the guise of "technical and training assistance," special American "experts" will be responsible for regulating war production in all countries implementing this plan and completely standardizing this production according to the American model. At the same time, special U.S. representatives must supervise the use of these armaments. Particularly noteworthy in this regard is Truman's admission that the purpose of the arms program is to establish, as quickly as possible in various countries, well-organized and well-trained armies capable of maintaining domestic order. Truman intends to use this to implement the notorious Article 4 of the Atlantic Treaty, which stipulates that the United States can intervene to help any country participating in this aggressive treaty to suppress its domestic progressive democratic movements.

One cannot but discuss a question: namely: what prospects does the arms program offer for the economies of Western European countries that have been pushed into a serious crisis by the first phase of the Marshall Plan? Truman said in his message that the countries of the Brussels Group—Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg—as well as Italy, Norway, and Denmark, spend $5.5 billion annually on military expenses. Truman pointed out in his message that the current huge military expenditures of Western European countries are not enough, and demanded that they increase them even more.

There is no doubt that the huge scope of militarism in Marshallized countries, and the resulting huge expenses, have played a major role in exacerbating the economic crisis in Western Europe and in the continuous decline in the living standards of the working masses.

Since the purpose of the arms program is to greatly expand the system of militarizing the Western European economy, which is already experiencing a crisis, this can only lead to an inevitable result—the chaos of the economies of Western European countries. But this also means a blow to the U.S. economy.

Of course, Truman can successfully export crisis and economic collapse to Western Europe. But he will never be able to avoid the serious economic crisis in the United States.

Malinin pointed out: In domestic policy, generally speaking, Truman's leadership has resulted in extreme deterioration. The 1949 federal budget not only had no surplus, but also had a deficit of $2 billion. The planned deficit for the 1950 budget will reach as much as $5 billion. The government's tax system has already aroused popular protest. The amount of U.S. national debt has reached the astronomical figure of $252 billion, and unemployment has become a serious problem affecting the entire domestic life of the United States. Production is declining. Exports are falling into a serious crisis.

In foreign policy, even though Truman exaggerates with all his prejudices, he still cannot cite any facts to prove that his policy has been successful. The Marshall Plan is falling apart in all aspects. Britain and Western European countries are living through hard times economically. The pound and the dollar are engaged in a fierce struggle. In China, the U.S. lackey Chiang Kai-shek has completely failed. In Greece, the economy faces a terrible collapse, and the royalist fascist camp is dejected. What is the result of the infamous anti-Soviet "Cold War"? Is the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference not strong enough to prove that Truman's "invention" has failed? Today, even many representatives of the U.S. business community are condemning Truman's discriminatory policy on trade with the Soviet Union, which is primarily and effectively hitting the U.S. economy?

Under these circumstances, what does the arms program proposed by the U.S. President indicate? This shows that Truman dares not face the facts. He turns his back on the facts and stubbornly continues the arbitrary path of war-mongers, deliberately stimulating people's nerves, inciting war madness, and using fear, doubt, and panic to poison the international atmosphere. If it is not to use an atmosphere of fear and panic to promote the far-reaching plans of war-mongers, then what other meaning can this plan to incite war madness have? President Truman's new arms program is a component of the North Atlantic Treaty aimed at the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. This is why new cries of anti-Soviet movement have appeared at the same time as the publication of the arms program.

However, the instigators of the new anti-Soviet movement do not understand the psychology of the people. If they think that they can solve the deep dissatisfaction and anxiety of the broad American people with hysterical cries, they will be greatly disappointed. In fact, the anti-Soviet movement they launched has produced the opposite result. Even reactionary American leaders like Taft have had to admit that the Soviet Union's policy does not contain a threat of war, while the North Atlantic Treaty and arms program are policies of aggression – policies of preparing for war and launching war. Truman's new plan has been condemned by the broad American people. This is reflected in the attitude of many congressmen who oppose the plan, and also reflected in the reluctant tricks of die-hards like Vandenberg and Dulles.

Malinin concludes: This is an indisputable fact. Truman stubbornly obliterates these facts. Moreover, in his message to Congress, he even attempts to portray the path he is following as an example of realistic policy. Let those who like this kind of policy have illusions. Like many times in the past, real life will give a powerful answer. Real life has long proven, and will continue to prove in the future: the policy that Truman is following is not only a reactionary policy, but also an illusory policy. This kind of policy does not start from reality, but is a gambling policy. History tells us that any gambling policy can never avoid failure. The same failure is waiting for Truman and his associates' policies. The war-mongers continue to step up their activities, because they feel that time is not on their side. The powerful peace camp is confidently moving forward to meet tomorrow; it firmly believes in its own strength, firmly believes in the justice of its cause, and firmly believes that the goals it pursues are completely achievable.

### 妄想摆脱国内经济危机  杜鲁门疯狂煽动战争　真理报斥美帝武装外国计划

　　妄想摆脱国内经济危机
    杜鲁门疯狂煽动战争
  　真理报斥美帝武装外国计划
    【新华社北平十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报国际问题评论家马里宁发表题为“杜鲁门煽动战争狂”的评论。马里宁写道：美国参院还没有时间将经过长时间内部斗争后批准北大西洋公约的纪录编好，美国总统就已经要求国会赶紧批准他所拟订的武装北大西洋公约的签字国的计划了。
    仅仅在不久以前，国务院在七月十一日答复某些参议员的正式质询时，曾正式声明说：军事援助计划，并不是实施北大西洋公约的计划。今天，杜鲁门已把昨天许下的诺言抛在一边，要求国会紧急批准武装外国的计划，因为这计划是北大西洋公约不可分的一个主要的组成部分。杜鲁门为了要达到他的目的，不惜在他的咨文中歪曲事实和对苏联作敌意的攻击。
    杜鲁门说：美国的使命，是建立“享受繁荣与安全的世界社会”！让我们来揭开他这些伪善的陈腔烂调，看看他的咨文真正的内容是什么呢？
    杜鲁门计划的所谓基本原则究竟是什么呢？美国总统再次声言：美国藉既成事实，担负了国际事务中只此一家的领导角色。杜鲁门在说这样的话的时候，为了明显的理由，谨慎地避开了一个问题：美国“转变”为世界某种最高主权国，到底是谁同意的，是谁批准的呢？对于这个最高主权国，国际合作只是空话，而它自己的要求都是至高无上的法律。
    马里宁继称：美国追求世界霸权的露骨的野心，也就是杜鲁门所要求的“领导权”，其唯一的借口是无穷无尽的谈论所谓美国国家安全的利益。但是，杜鲁门所了解的“国家安全”是什么呢？杜鲁门和他的国务院所了解的美国“国家安全”体系是要把美国的疆界扩展到欧洲，而且还要在各个大陆上建立美国的军事战略基地网。
    与这个计划的实质完全一致，杜鲁门向联合国发出了示威式的挑战。据杜鲁门说，联合国目前不能取得和平。唯一能够取得和平的是美国和美国总统。杜鲁门建议的军备计划的必然结果是篡夺联合国宪章所规定的基本权力，使联合国变成美帝国主义专横统治的消极旁观者。
    杜鲁门提出的一九五○财政年度的第一个军事援外草案要求拨款近十五亿元，其中一半的武器从美国现有的存储与剩余中拨出，其余几乎都是新生产的武器。这样看来，军备计划的目的一方面是卖出陈旧式样的武器，另一方面是作为给受危机现象影响的许多工业部门提供新定单的手段。杜鲁门咨文执拗地强调：通过他所提出的武装计划是维持美国的国际经济计划，特别是马歇尔计划所必需的。　国务院的小册子说明了杜鲁门心中要说的话，从这个小册子可以看出来，武装计划之实施，对于除去阻碍美国私人向欧洲投资的障碍，乃是必需的。这就是说，杜鲁门军备计划作用在于建立一种特殊的体系，便于美国垄断资本对欧洲、亚洲和西半球的许多国家的经济进行更为巨大的攻势。杜鲁门的计划规定：在“技术与训练援助”的掩盖下，美国的特殊“专家们”将负责管制实行这个计划的一切国家中的战争生产，并且按照美国的模型将这种生产进行完全的标准化。同时，美国的特别代表必须监督这些军备的使用。在这一方面特别值得注意的是杜鲁门承认军备计划的目的在于尽可能迅速地在各国建立组织精密而且训练有素的能够维持国内治安的军队。杜鲁门打算借此实行恶名昭著的大西洋公约第四条，该条文规定美国可以出面干涉，帮助参加这个侵略公约的任何国家，镇压其国内进步的民主运动。
    人们不能不讨论一个问题：即是：军备计划对于被第一阶段的马歇尔计划推到严重危机上的西欧国家的经济提供了什么样的前景呢？杜鲁门在他的咨文里说：布鲁塞尔集团的国家——英、法、比、荷、卢——以及意大利、挪威和丹麦每年要花费五十五亿元作军事费用，而杜鲁门在他的咨文里指出，现在西欧国家的庞大军费是不够用的，并且要求它们更要加多些。
    毫无疑问，马歇尔化国家的军国主义的巨大范围，和由此而来的庞大费用，已经在加剧西欧经济的危机上和在劳动大众生活标准的不断下降上，起了很大的作用。
    由于军备计划的目的在于大大地扩大已在经历着危机的西欧经济实行军事化的制度，这只能造成一个不可避免的结果——西欧各国经济的混乱。但这也意味着对于美国经济的打击。
    当然，杜鲁门可以顺利地向西欧输出危机和经济破灭。但是他决无法避免美国严重的经济危机。
    马里宁指出：在国内政策上，一般地讲，杜鲁门领导的结果，是极端恶劣的。一九四九年度的联邦预算，不仅没有剩余，反而亏空了二十亿元。计划中的一九五○年预算的赤字，将达五十亿元之多。政府的税收制度已经引起了人民的抗议。美国国债的数目已达到二千五百二十亿的天文数字，失业已经变成了影响整个美国国内生活的严重问题。生产已在下降。出口正陷入严重的危机中。
    在外交政策上，尽管杜鲁门以他一切的偏见夸大其辞，他同样也不能举出证明他的政策已告成功的任何事实。马歇尔计划在各方面都支离破碎。英国及西欧国家在经济上过着艰苦的日子。英镑与美元在进行着激烈的搏斗。在中国，美国的走狗蒋介石已完全失败。在希腊，经济面临可怕的崩溃，保皇法西斯阵营已垂头丧气。臭名昭彰的反苏“冷战”的结果如何呢？难道巴黎外长会议还不够强烈地证明杜鲁门这个“发明”已经失败了吗？今天不是连许多美国企业界的代表也谴责杜鲁门的对苏贸易的歧视政策，首先就是有效地打击了美国的经济吗？
    在这种情形之下，美国总统提出的武装计划表明了什么呢？这表明，杜鲁门不敢面对事实，他转过来背对着事实，并顽固地继续进行战争贩子专断的路线，故意刺激人们的神经，煽动战争狂，并利用恐惧、疑虑和惊惶的情绪来毒化国际间的空气。如果不是利用恐惧与惊惶的空气来推行战争贩子远大的计划，那末，这个煽动战争狂的计划，还能有什么其他的意义呢？杜鲁门总统的新武装计划是针对苏联及人民民主国家的北大西洋公约的组成部分。这就是为什么在武装计划发表的同时，又出现了反苏运动的新叫嚣。
    但是，新的反苏运动的策动者并不懂得人民的心理。如果他们以为用歇斯特里的叫嚣就可以解决广大的美国人民深沉的不满和不安，他们一定会大为失望的。其实，他们发起的反苏运动已产生了相反的结果。甚至反动的美国领袖象塔夫脱之流，也不得不承认苏联的政策并不含有战争的威胁，而北大西洋公约及武装计划倒是侵略的政策——备战和发动战争的政策。杜鲁门的新计划受到广大的美国人民的谴责，这反映在许多反对计划的议员的态度上，也反映在象范登堡及杜勒斯一流的死硬分子的勉为其难的花样上。
    马里宁结语称：这是无可置辩的事实。杜鲁门顽固地抹煞这些事实。而且，在他的致国会咨文中，他甚至企图把他所遵循的路线描写为现实主义政策的榜样。让那些喜欢这种政策的人去抱幻想吧。象过去许多次曾经有过的一样，现实生活将会作有力的回答。现实生活早就证明过，而且今后仍然会证实：杜鲁门所遵循的政策，不仅是反动的政策，而且是幻想的政策。这种政策不是从现实出发，是一种赌博的政策。历史告诉我们：任何赌博的政策永远是避免不了失败的。同样的失败正等待着杜鲁门及其同伙的政策。战争贩子继续加紧活动，因为他们感到时间是不利于他们的。强大的和平阵营充满自信地前进，去迎接明天；它坚信自己的力量，坚信自己事业的正义性，并坚信自己追求的目的是完全可以实现的。
