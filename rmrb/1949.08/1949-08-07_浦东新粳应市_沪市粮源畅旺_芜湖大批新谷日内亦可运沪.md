    New Grain Arrives from Various Places! Smoothly Passing the Lean Season!
    Pudong New Japonica Rice Enters the Market
    Shanghai's Grain Supply is Plentiful
    Large Quantities of New Grain from Wuhu Can Also Be Shipped to Shanghai Within Days
    [Shanghai News] Recently, new grains from various places have been successively entering the market, and the source of grain is becoming more and more smooth. A lot of thin rice and early rice are transported from Nan'gang, and a lot of white japonica rice from Tongli, Lili, and Luxu has also arrived, so the price has dropped. On the first day of this month, the northern rice market opened, which was 1,000 yuan lower than before. Later, because the number of sellers increased, the closing price was 2,000 yuan lower than the opening price. The price of early rice has fallen even more, with the closing price of high-quality early rice at 56,000 yuan, a drop of 4,000 yuan. The prices of various goods in the southern rice market have also fallen by 1,000 to 3,000 yuan. The grain company's sales of rice have decreased due to low demand. The total sales in the north and south markets were only 595 shi, while the registered arrival of goods in the two markets reached 7,645 shi and 6 dou. It is estimated that the arrival of new goods from various places will be even more smooth in the near future.
    Since the new Pudong japonica rice was shipped to Shanghai and entered the market on the 2nd, the arrival of goods will increase day by day. Therefore, the grain supply in Shanghai has been completely resolved, and the grain price has fallen again and again due to the plentiful grain source. The price on the 2nd fell by another 2,000 yuan to 3,000 yuan compared with the 1st. Flour prices fell because of the drop in quotations in Wuxi. The opening price of Battleship flour was 7,950 yuan. Later, the hoarders saw that there were many sellers and their confidence turned weak, taking the opportunity to sell at high prices. As a result, the price fell all the way. The closing price of Battleship flour fell to 7,420 yuan. The grain company shipped less due to low demand. On the 2nd, the rice industry in Shanghai also received a letter from the rice industry in Wuhu, Anhui Province, confirming that early rice has now entered the market in the area, and people are greatly relieved. A large number of new grains can be shipped east to Shanghai soon. At the same time, new grains from Songjiang, Jiashan, and Xiashi will also enter the market successively in half a month, and the prices in the producing areas have begun to decline. The price of rice in Wuxi fell to 40,000 yuan on the 2nd, and the price in Hangzhou has fallen below 40,000 yuan. At present, citizens have plenty of food and grain merchants have plenty of reserves, and the People's Government also has extremely sufficient reserves. The lean season of grain in Shanghai can be safely passed.

    各地新谷登场！安渡青黄不接！
    浦东新粳应市
    沪市粮源畅旺
    芜湖大批新谷日内亦可运沪
    【上海讯】新近各地新谷相继登场，粮食来源日畅，由南港运来薄稻及早稻很多，同里、黎里、芦墟白粳到货亦不少，故价格下落，本月一日北米市场初开即较前下落一千元，后因卖出者增多，至收市复比开市下落二千元。早稻下落更多，高货早稻收市五万六千元，下降四千元。南米市场各货亦下落一千至三千元不等。粮食公司售米，因需要不多，售量亦减少，南北两市场合计仅出售五百九十五石；而两市场登记到货就达七千六百四十五石六斗。估计不日各地新货登场，来货当更畅旺。
    自二日浦东新粳运沪应市后，来货将逐日增多，故沪市粮食供应，已经完满解决，而粮价亦因粮源畅旺一再下落，二日价又比一日落二千元到三千元。面粉因无锡报价下落，兵船粉开盘七千九百五十元，后来囤户看见卖出的人多，心气转虚，乘机逢高卖出，于是价格便就此一路下落。兵船粉收盘落至七千四百二十元，粮食公司因需要少，出货亦少。上海市米业界二日并接获芜湖安徽省米业界方面来信，证实该地早稻现已登场，人心大安，大批新谷即可东运来沪。同时，松江、嘉善、硖山一带的新谷，半月后亦将陆续登场，产地价格开始下降，无锡米价二日降至四万元，杭州已落到四万以内。目前市民食粮及粮商存粮尚多，人民政府储备亦极充足，沪市粮食的青黄不接，决可安然渡过。
