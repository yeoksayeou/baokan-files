    August 1, 1927, is the day when the advanced forces of the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, launched an armed uprising in Nanchang to break the counter-revolution led by Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei. It is the day of the birth of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army—the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In fact, it is also the day of the birth of the new people's democratic China. When the Kuomintang reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, under the instigation of imperialism, replaced the bright China with a dark China, the "August 1st" Uprising led China away from the path of darkness and towards the path of light, pointing out that the Chinese people, through a long and arduous armed struggle, would surely reach light and victory. The Nanchang Uprising and many other uprisings across the country at that time were decided by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. After Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary clique announced a counter-revolutionary coup on April 12, 1927, the Chinese Communist Party decided to lead the people to resist Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolution. The August 1st Nanchang Uprising was the first of a series of revolutionary uprisings at that time. Twenty-two years have passed since that uprising. The young people of that time are now middle-aged, and the middle-aged people of that time are now old. But the revolution has finally been victorious.

    "A single spark can start a prairie fire." Comrade Mao Zedong observed the future of the people's army, which was still in extremely difficult and extremely weak condition. After twenty-two years of struggle, Comrade Mao Zedong's scientific prediction has completely become a reality. The People's Liberation Army has grown from small to large, from weak to strong, and has already forged a new people's democratic China that will soon be victorious throughout the country.

    The total source of the People's Liberation Army's strength is the people. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote in his "On Coalition Government": "The reason why this army has strength" is because "they are not united and fighting for the private interests of a few people or a narrow group, but for the just people's war, for the interests of the broad masses of the people, and for the interests of the entire nation." This army is a tool to protect the people and suppress the reactionaries, which is completely different from all the armies of the ruling classes in the past, which were tools to oppress the people and protect the reactionaries. The main component of this army is peasants, an army formed on the basis of peasant liberation, but this army is also completely different from any peasant war force in Chinese history.

    The Chinese People's Liberation Army has the following three main characteristics:

    First, the People's Liberation Army is an army under the leadership of the advanced party of the modern Chinese proletariat, namely the Chinese Communist Party. This has never existed in Chinese history before, nor could it possibly exist. This characteristic determines the following characteristics.

    Second, the People's Liberation Army is an army that has both ideology and lofty ideals. This army is imbued with education about Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and education about patriotism and internationalism. Every soldier can consciously understand why they are fighting and understand the present and future of the Chinese revolution. The composition of this army is workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, with workers and peasants accounting for about 90 percent and revolutionary intellectuals accounting for about 10 percent, and the revolutionary intellectuals have accepted Marxism-Leninism. They not only know how to educate the army with revolutionary spirit and resolutely implement the political line of the Communist Party and its specific policies, but also know what the future of the revolution is, that is, the revolution will steadily develop from a people's democratic dictatorship republic to socialism and communism.

    Third, the People's Liberation Army is an army with a high degree of centralized discipline built on a democratic foundation. This democratic system and highly centralized discipline system enable them to maintain close ties with the people and maintain their high combat effectiveness in any difficult situation.

    These three characteristics of the People's Liberation Army are interconnected and indispensable. The second and third characteristics reflect the leadership of the proletariat. Without the leadership of the proletariat, that is to say, without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, it would be impossible to form such an ideological and consciously disciplined army.

    These three characteristics are the result of the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong's political and military lines in the People's Liberation Army. Comrade Mao Zedong's line launched a struggle between two lines in the Chinese Communist Party and in the People's Liberation Army. On the one hand, it opposed surrenderism that ignored armed struggle, and on the other hand, it opposed the purely military viewpoint that ignored mass work. On the one hand, it opposed warlordism that reflected the old mercenary army, and on the other hand, it opposed the "roving rebel" thought that reflected the old-style peasant war. On the one hand, it opposed conservatism in strategic issues, and on the other hand, it opposed adventurism in strategic issues. And in all issues, it adhered to and developed the correct policy of Marxism-Leninism. It was precisely Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership that formed the complete military building ideology, military building principles, and military building system of this people's army, formed the complete strategy and tactics of this people's army, and guided this people's army from small to large, from weak to strong, to become an invincible force.

    In the "Introduction to 'The Communist'" written in 1939, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out to some comrades in the Party who distrusted the people's armed forces: "In China, without armed struggle, there would be no status for the proletariat, no status for the people, no status for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution."

    In "On Coalition Government" written in 1945, Comrade Mao Zedong again pointed out to some people outside the Party who were wavering on the issue of the people's army: "Without a people's army, the people have nothing."

    Now everything is very clear: if there were no such powerful people's army under the leadership of the proletariat, the old China could not be destroyed, and the new China could not be established. Comrade Mao Zedong and his comrades-in-arms concentrated their efforts on creating and managing this people's army for a long time of twenty-two years, which was a work related to the fate of the people of the whole country.

    The hardships and difficulties encountered by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in its struggle against imperialism and its running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, in the past twenty-two years are rarely seen or almost unprecedented in the political history and war history of mankind. However, we have overcome them one by one. This is the concentrated expression of the great fighting heroism of the Chinese people, and it is also the result of Comrade Mao Zedong's application of Marxism-Leninism to guide the Chinese revolution. These are still important lessons for our current and future construction undertakings. This lesson is that since we had the ability to overcome such unprecedented military difficulties in the past, then we will also have the ability to overcome the economic and other inevitable difficulties that we will inevitably encounter in the present and future. These kinds of difficulties are given to us by the oppression of imperialism and the backwardness of old China, and they are unavoidable. What do we rely on to overcome difficulties? What we rely on is still the great fighting heroism of the Chinese people, and the guidance of the wisdom of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought represented by Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The Chinese people are brave and hardworking." The brave and hardworking Chinese people, plus the wisdom of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, then, like our victory on the military front, we will surely win victory on the fronts of economic construction and cultural construction.

    Now, the working people and revolutionary intellectuals throughout the country deeply trust the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. However, some people in the newly liberated areas (including well-intentioned and enthusiastic intellectuals) feel bewildered in the face of economic difficulties and personal difficulties caused by natural disasters, man-made disasters, and enemy blockades. This is because they have just been liberated and have not yet had the experience of struggling to overcome difficulties under the leadership of the Communist Party. The twenty-two years of the People's Liberation War tell us that in any area where the enemy is driven out and a people's regime is established, it is inevitable to go through a difficult period. This kind of difficulty can be overcome, but it must be paid with necessary time and arduous efforts. In some places, a few months or a year is enough, while in other places, it takes two, three, or even more years to completely get the military, political, economic, cultural, and other tasks out of the old chaotic track created by the enemy and completely embark on a new track of consolidation and development. In order to overcome difficulties, it is necessary to complete several fundamental tasks, which are: (1) Eliminate feudal forces and enable peasants to obtain land; (2) Implement streamlining troops and simplifying administration to reduce national expenditures; (3) On the basis of the above two items, initially restore and develop all beneficial industrial and agricultural production. Without these fundamental tasks, the so-called overcoming difficulties is just empty talk. To complete the above tasks, in the newly liberated southern and northwestern provinces, generally speaking, it is necessary to prepare to pay about three years of time, and it is useless to be too impatient. In large cities like Shanghai, under the conditions that imperialism and its running dogs are implementing a blockade policy against us, it is also necessary to add the task of dispersing the population.

    We are capable of overcoming difficulties, no matter what kind of difficulties we are not afraid of. The twenty-two years of struggle history of the People's Liberation Army have given us such experience and confidence. As long as the Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army, and the people of the whole country understand the nature of the difficulties they encounter and resolutely implement the fundamental policies of overcoming difficulties, we will achieve our goals.

### 我们是能够克服困难的  纪念中国人民解放军的二十二周年

    我们是能够克服困难的
    纪念中国人民解放军的二十二周年
    一九二七年的八月一日，是中国人民的先进力量，在中国共产党领导下为着打破以蒋介石汪精卫为首的反革命，而在南昌举行武装起义的日子。这是中国工农红军——中国人民解放军诞生的日子，实际上，这又是人民民主的新中国诞生的日子。当蒋介石汪精卫等国民党反动派在帝国主义唆使下把黑暗的中国代替了光明的中国的时候，“八一”起义则把中国离开黑暗的道路，引向光明的道路，指出了中国人民经过长期的严重的武装斗争，必定可以到达光明和胜利。南昌起义及当时全国各地的许多起义，是中国共产党中央决定的。在一九二七年四月十二日蒋介石反动派宣布了反革命政变之后，中国共产党即决定率领人民反抗蒋介石反革命。八一南昌起义就是当时一连串革命起义的第一个起义。从这次起义到现在，业已二十二年了。当时的青年人，现在已经是中年了，当时的中年人现在已经是老年了。但是革命则终于胜利了。
    “星星之火，可以燎原”。毛泽东同志这样观察了当时还处在极端艰苦而且还极其弱小的人民军队的前途。经过二十二年来的斗争，毛泽东同志的科学预见完全变成了现实，人民解放军从小到大，从弱到强，已经打出了一个即将在全国范围内胜利的人民民主的新中国。
    人民解放军的力量的总根源是人民。毛泽东同志在其“论联合政府”上写过：“这个军队之所以有力量”，就是因为“他们不是为着少数人的或狭隘集团的私利，而是为着正义的人民战争，为着广大人民群众的利益，为着全民族的利益，而结合，而战斗的”。这个军队是保护人民，和压迫反动派的工具，完全区别于过去一切统治阶级的作为压迫人民和保护反动派的工具的军队。这个军队的主要成份是农民，是在农民解放的基础之上组成起来的军队，但是这个军队也完全区别于中国历史上任何农民战争的队伍。
    中国人民解放军具有以下三个主要的特点：
    第一，人民解放军是在中国近代无产阶级先进政党即中国共产党领导之下的军队。这是过去中国历史上没有过，也不可能有的。这个特点决定了以下的特点。
    第二，人民解放军是有思想的同时也就是有崇高理想的军队。这个军队贯串了关于马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想的教育，贯串了关于爱国主义与国际主义的教育，每一个战士能够自觉他们是为什么而打仗，懂得中国革命的现在与将来。这个军队的成份是工人农民和革命知识分子，工农占百分之九十左右，革命知识分子占百分之十左右，而革命知识分子则是接受了马克思列宁主义的。他们不但懂得用革命精神教育军队，坚决地执行共产党的政治路线及其各项具体政策，而且懂得革命的前途是什么，即是说革命将经过人民民主专政的共和国稳步地发展到社会主义和共产主义。
    第三，人民解放军是建立在民主基础上的有高度集中纪律的军队。这种民主制度和高度集中纪律的制度，使他们不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，都能保持与人民群众的密切联系，保持自己的高度战斗力。
    人民解放军的这三个特点是互相联系的，缺一不可的，而第二第三这两个特点，正是表现了无产阶级领导这一个特点。没有无产阶级的领导，也就是说没有中国共产党的领导，就不可能形成这样有思想的与有自觉纪律的军队。
    这三个特点乃是毛泽东同志的政治路线与军事路线在人民解放军中的领导所达到的结果。毛泽东同志的路线在中国共产党中和在人民解放军中开展了两条路线的斗争。一方面反对了忽视武装斗争的投降主义，另方面又反对了忽视群众工作的单纯军事观点。一方面反对了反映旧雇佣军队的军阀主义，另方面又反对了反映旧式农民战争的“流寇思想”。一方面反对了战略问题上的保守主义，另方面又反对了战略问题上的冒险主义。而在一切问题上，则坚持了与发挥了马克思列宁主义的正确方针。正是毛泽东同志这一个领导，形成了这个人民军队的完整的建军思想、建军原则与建军制度，形成了这个人民军队的完整的战略与战术，而引导这个人民军队从小到大，从弱到强，以至成为无敌的力量。
    在一九三九年写的“共产党人发刊词”上，毛泽东同志对着党内若干不信任人民武装力量的同志们，这样指出：“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”
    在一九四五年写的“论联合政府”上，毛泽东同志又对着党外某些在人民军队问题上发生动摇的人们，这样指出：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”
    现在一切情况都很明白：如果没有这样一个强大的在无产阶级领导之下的人民军队，旧中国便不能破坏，新中国便不能建立。毛泽东同志和他的战友们在二十二年的长时间中集中精力创设和经营这个人民军队，是一个关系了全国人民命运的工作。
    二十二年来中国人民解放军在和帝国主义及其走狗中国反动派的斗争中所遇到的艰难困苦，是在人类的政治史上和战争史上所少见的，或者说，几乎是没有前例的。然而我们都一个一个地加以战胜了。这是中国人民伟大的战斗英雄主义的集中表现，这又是毛泽东同志应用马克思列宁主义指导中国革命的结果。对于我们现在与将来所临到的建设事业来说，这些依然是重要的教训。这种教训就是说：我们在过去既然有能力克服军事上那样史无前例的重重困难，那末，在现在和将来，我们也就有能力去克服那种在经济上及其他一切所不可避免地要遇到的重重困难。这类的困难是帝国主义的压迫与旧中国的落后所给我们的，是不可避免的。我们依靠什么去克服困难呢？我们依靠的，仍然是中国人民的伟大的战斗英雄主义，是毛泽东同志所代表的马克思列宁主义的智慧指导。毛泽东同志说：“中国人民是勇敢而勤劳的”。勇敢而勤劳的中国人民，加上马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的智慧，那末，象我们在军事战线上的胜利一样，我们在经济建设与文化建设的战线上也必然会赢得胜利。
    现在全国劳动人民和革命知识分子都深切地信赖共产党和人民解放军。但是有些新解放区的人民（其中包括好心的热忱的知识分子），在天灾人祸和敌人封锁所造成的经济困难和个人生活困难面前感到了惶惑，这是因为他们还是刚刚被解放，还没有在共产党领导下克服困难的斗争经验。二十二年的人民解放战争告诉我们，在任何一个驱逐敌人建立人民政权的区域，必不可免地要经过一个困难的时期。这种困难是能够克服的，但须付以必要的时间和艰苦的努力。有些地方，有几个月或者一年的时间就够了，有些地方则须经过两年，三年，甚至更多的时间，才能使军事、政治、经济、文化等项工作完全脱离敌人所造成的旧的混乱的轨道，而完全走上新的巩固发展的轨道。为着克服困难，必须完成几项根本性质的工作，这就是：（一）消灭封建势力，使农民得到土地；（二）实行精兵简政，简省国家开支；（三）在上列两项基础之上初步地恢复和发展一切有益的工业和农业生产。没有这几项根本性质的工作，所谓克服困难，只是一句空话。而要完成上述几项工作，在新解放的南方和西北各省，一般地说来，必须准备付以三年左右的时间，过于性急是没有用的。在上海这样的大城市，在帝国主义及其走狗对我实行封锁政策的条件之下，还须加上一条疏散人口的工作。
    我们是能够克服困难的，不管什么样的困难也不怕，人民解放军的二十二年的斗争史给了我们这样一种经验和信心，只须共产党、人民解放军和全国人民明了自己所遇困难的性质，坚决地执行克服困难的各项根本政策，我们就能达到目的。
