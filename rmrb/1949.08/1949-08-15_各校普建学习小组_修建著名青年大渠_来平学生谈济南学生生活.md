    Various Schools Universally Establish Study Groups
    Construct the Famous Youth Canal
    Students from Beiping Discuss Student Life in Jinan
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Students from Jinan's Liming Middle School who collectively came to Beiping to take university entrance exams discussed the recent situation of students in Jinan as follows: Over 30,000 middle school and university students in Jinan, since liberation, have made great progress in less than a year due to gaining political freedom and the government's systematic and planned political education. Five or six thousand students have successively applied to East China University and East China Military and Political University, and the two classes that have graduated have joined the workforce. A large number of out-of-school and unemployed youths have entered specialized schools established by the People's Government, such as the Railway Specialized School, Medical Specialized School, Industrial Specialized School, Commerce Specialized School, Transportation Specialized School, Electrical Specialized School, and Art Specialized School, to learn useful technical knowledge and find a bright future. Students in school study diligently and have initially established correct study attitudes and methods. Various schools have universally established study groups to improve study efficiency and launched a good student movement and a model creation movement. Cultural and recreational activities make the schools vibrant. Every university and middle school has its own drama troupe and chorus, which are regularly guided by the Shandong People's Cultural Work Troupe. They usually hold competitions and weekend parties in schools, and they also perform in nearby factories and help workers rehearse scripts. During festivals, they hold city-wide grand competitions and parades of drama and singing, such as from "July 1st" to "July 7th," Jinan was lively for seven whole days, with propaganda activities and performances by students and workers everywhere. Jinan students' labor perspective is generally beginning to be established. Even students at the "aristocratic" private Liming Middle School (a mission school) personally dug through the stinking sewers on the road, and used Saturday afternoons to travel outside the city to carry sand and dig ice to make sand pits and skating rinks that the school used to hire people to build and repair. During the summer vacation, more than 10,000 middle school and university students wholeheartedly and happily organized to excavate the famous "Youth Canal." This is a river that starts from Thousand Buddha Mountain in the south and connects to the Daqing River in the north, crossing Jinan City, with a total length of more than 30 li and a width of 2 to 5 zhang; seven or eight li of the riverbed were filled with filth dumped by residents over time, causing the river to silt up, emit odors, and affect summer sanitation every year. During the Kuomintang era, the corrupt and degenerate puppet municipal government's health bureau repeatedly levied taxes claiming to dredge the canal, but it always remained on paper, and all the taxes collected went into their own pockets. This year, under the call of the People's Government, the Municipal Student Federation, and the Youth League, middle school and university students throughout the city enthusiastically undertook voluntary labor, used the summer vacation to serve the people, and further tempered their labor perspective. They get up at 4:00 every morning, work until 10:00 in the morning, study after eating, and then work again from 6:00 in the afternoon. Now it is mostly completed and has been unanimously praised by the citizens of Jinan. (Jin Feng)

    各校普建学习小组
    修建著名青年大渠
    来平学生谈济南学生生活
    【本报讯】集体来平投考大学的济南黎明中学学生谈济南学生近况如下：济南大中学生三万余人，解放以后由于获得政治的自由和人民政府有系统有计划的政治教育，不到一年的时间内，有很大的进步。先后有五六千人投考华东大学和华东军政大学，已毕业的两班参加了工作。并有大批失学失业青年进入人民政府所设的铁专、医专、工专、商专、交专、电专、艺专等专门学校，学习有用的技术知识，找到光明的出路。在校同学则学习认真，初步建立了正确的学习态度和学习方法。各校普遍成立学习小组以提高学习效率，展开好学生运动和创造模范运动。文娱活动使学校生气勃勃，每个大中学校都有自己的剧团和歌咏团，由山东人民文工团经常加以指导。平时在校内展开竞赛和举办周末晚会，并到附近工厂演出和帮助工人排练剧本。到节日则举行全市的盛大的戏剧和歌咏的大竞赛和大检阅，如“七一”到“七七”，济南市整整热闹了七天，到处都是学生和工人的宣传活动和演出。济南学生的劳动观点普遍的在开始建立中，即以“贵族化”著名的私立黎明中学（教会学校）学生都亲手挖通马路上的臭阴沟，又利用星期六的下午以旅行方式到城外去背沙土和挖冰，做成以往学校雇人铺修的沙坑和溜冰场。暑假中一万多大中学生，更衷心愉快地组织起来开挖有名的“青年渠”。这是一条南起千佛山北通大清河横穿济南城的河流，共长三十多里，宽二丈到五丈；其中有七八里河身，由于居民往河上倾倒秽土，日积月累，致使河道淤塞，蒸发臭气，每年影响夏令卫生。国民党时代伪市府卫生局贪污腐化，屡次征派捐税扬言疏浚而始终止于纸面公文，将所收税款尽饱私囊。今年在人民政府、市学联和青年团的号召下，全市大中学生踊跃承担义务劳动，利用暑假为人民服务，并进一步锻炼劳动观点。每日清晨四时起床，劳动至上午十时，吃饭后进行学习，下午六时起再行劳动，现在已大部完成，受到济南市民一致的赞扬。（金凤）
