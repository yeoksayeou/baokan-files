Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 24th: Budapest News: The Chinese Democratic Youth Delegation held its first reception here on the afternoon of the 22nd to entertain youth representatives from fraternal countries in Southeast Asia. More than 150 representatives from India, Burma, Malaya, Indonesia, Vietnam, and other countries were invited to attend. The reception began with a speech by Xiao Hua, Deputy Head of the Chinese Delegation. He introduced the Chinese youth movement, youth organizations, and the great contributions of Chinese youth in the Liberation War. When discussing the reasons for the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, Xiao Hua particularly pointed out that the vigorous development of national liberation movements in various colonial countries in Southeast Asia played a powerful supporting and coordinating role for the Chinese People's Liberation War. Chinese youth are willing to unite with the youth of Southeast Asian countries to fight to the end for national independence, liberation, democracy, and freedom. Chinese youth believe that this great struggle will surely achieve final victory.

The guests then spoke enthusiastically. Indian representative Vimala said: The two great nations of China and India have a long history of friendship, and the struggle of the Chinese people is a good example for us. China's road is India's road. The fate of India's reactionary rulers will be the same as that of Chiang Kai-shek. After Vimala finished speaking, he led everyone in enthusiastically cheering: "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" Vietnamese representative Du Duc Xanh said: The people of China and Vietnam are like good brothers in the same family, and China's victory is also Vietnam's victory. The victory of the Chinese and Vietnamese people will be a solid guarantee for peace in Southeast Asia. Indonesian representative Sukiyano shouted for freedom and liberation before speaking. He asked the Chinese representatives to tell all democratic youth in China that the youth of Indonesia must fight to the end until victory. Burmese representative Dong Xian said: Now 60% of Burma's land has been liberated, and we believe that the complete liberation of China and Burma is not far away. The announcement was met with enthusiastic applause. Xiao Hua and Dong Xian embraced each other amidst the applause. Finally, Malaysian representative Lin Yueliang introduced the revolutionary struggle being waged by the people of Malaya, saying: Every young person participating in the armed struggle swears to fight to the end.

During the reception, the Chinese delegation's performing arts troupe, which had just returned from a performance in Debrecen, immediately performed national songs and dances at the reception, receiving unanimous praise. Representatives from various countries brought books, banners, flowers, and other gifts to present to the Chinese delegation, while the Chinese delegation presented them with photos of Chairman Mao. The reception began at four o'clock and lasted until nine o'clock in the evening. Before the guests and hosts parted happily, they sang the Internationale in unison and shouted: "Long live Stalin! Long live Mao Zedong! Long live the Soviet Union! Long live the liberation of the people of Southeast Asia!"
