    [Suiyuan Electric Dispatch] The people of Suiyuan enthusiastically launched a movement to support the army during the "August 1st" Army Day. The "Xinmin Department" of the Military Region troops alone received more than 50 silk banners from various government offices and schools, as well as a large number of慰勞品 (comfort items/gifts) from Wu (chuan) Dong, Gui Sui, Longsheng and other counties, and hundreds of letters of appreciation from farmers and military families in Fengzhen. In villages such as Xiaying under the jurisdiction of Wu Dong, in addition to comforting gifts such as pigs, sheep, and chickens, the workers of the town also presented a flag, and women such as Liu Liunu also made exquisitely crafted comfort bags. The masses in the fifth district of Longsheng sent eight representatives to rush fifty miles overnight to deliver gifts to the stationed troops. The women of Sichengwa in Fengzhen wrote of their infinite gratitude to the People's Liberation Army in their letters of appreciation, saying: "When the Kuomintang was in power, we had little to eat and drink; now it is completely different from the past. Everyone has been helped to solve the problems of having no land and no seeds, and the families of soldiers are also living very well." Li Xirong, a military dependent in the third district of Fengzhen City, wrote her request in the letter: "We are receiving preferential treatment from the government in the liberated areas, and we have no shortage of food and clothing. We hope you will work hard, train hard, learn your skills well, and completely eliminate the Kuomintang reactionary remnants."
