　　[This Municipality News] Farmers in the suburbs of Beijing, under the leadership of the People's Government, have used methods such as repairing dikes, dredging rivers, and digging drainage ditches to save 150,000 mu of low-lying land from flooding, and rescued over 10,000 mu of flooded land.

　　As early as this spring, the Municipal Suburban District Work Committee, while leading the suburban masses in drought resistance work, also prepared for flood prevention and drainage. After entering the summer, each district actively carried out these preparations. The Thirteenth District mobilized 6,060 people to repair the moat dikes. In the Fourteenth District, the villages of Nangong and Tuanhe deepened a 770-zhang-long drainage ditch by two chi and widened it by five chi. The Sixteenth District mobilized over 4,000 people to repair 335 meters of the North Han River dike and dredge 600 meters of the South Han River. The Twentieth District constructed four irrigation and drainage canals, including Xinglong, Daodi, Chenglong, and Gongyi, in the spring. The above-mentioned projects were completed before the rainy season, allowing a large amount of manpower and material resources to be concentrated on the tense flood prevention and drainage work after the arrival of the rainy season. During the rainy season, continuous heavy rains caused flooding in some low-lying areas. In Dongba and Heiqiao in the Thirteenth District, over a thousand people dug a drainage ditch that was four and a half li long, draining 1,981 mu of flooded land. In the Fourteenth District, villages such as Sihaizhuang, Jixianzhuang, Yilezhuang, and Nangong dug over 50 drainage ditches, rescuing over 2,700 mu of flooded land. The Fifteenth District mobilized 2,766 people to dig a 12-li-long drainage ditch, allowing the accumulated water from over 500 mu of farmland to be discharged. Under the leadership of the district and village governments, the Sixteenth District, in just fifteen days, victoriously completed the 335-meter dike repair project on the North Han River and the 600-meter dredging project on the South Han River on July 23, containing the source of flooding in the western suburbs and saving 9,000 mu of paddy fields and over 20,000 mu of dry land, as well as the surrounding vast villages, roads, and airports, from flooding. In addition, the Seventeenth District also rescued 4,150 mu of farmland from flooding.

　　For more than fifty days, the suburban village cadres have consistently and arduously led the farmers in their struggle to overcome the floods. They have promoted a democratic style of work, consulting with the masses on everything, and using the time before and after work to convene forums for the workers, helping them to realize that "repairing the dike is like repairing your own kang," and that they are doing things for themselves. This corrected the mercenary attitude of some farmers, greatly improving work efficiency and saving a large amount of manpower and material resources.

　　郊区及早防汛防涝十五万亩地免水灾
    【本市讯】平市郊区农民，在人民政府领导下，以修堤浚河，挖掘排水沟等办法，使十五万亩洼地免于水实，并救出被淹地一万余亩。
    早在今年春季，市郊区工作委员会与领导郊区群众进行抗旱工作同时，即准备防汛防涝工作。入夏后，各区即积极进行。十三区动员群众六千零六十人修补了护城河堤。十四区南宫、团河两村将七百七十余丈长的排水沟，挖深了二尺，并加宽了五尺。十六区动员群众四千余人修补了北旱河河堤三百三十五公尺，疏浚南旱河六百公尺。二十区在春季即修筑了兴隆、稻地、成龙、公益等四个灌（溉）排（水）两用的水渠。上述工程在雨季以前均已完成，使大量人力、物力在雨季到来后的紧张防汛治涝工作中得以集中使用。在雨季中，霪雨连绵，某些低洼地区，积水成灾，十三区东坝、黑桥等地，经千余群众开掘了长达四里半的排水沟，出被淹地一千九百八十一亩。十四区四海庄、集贤庄、贻乐庄、南宫等村开掘排水沟五十余条，救出被淹地二千七百余亩。十五区动员群众二千七百六十六人，开掘了长达十二里的排水沟，使五百余亩农地的积水得以宣泄。十六区在区、村政府领导下，仅十五天时间，即于七月二十三日胜利地完成了北旱河的三百三十五公尺的河堤修补工程与南旱河六百公尺的疏浚工程，扼住了西郊水患的源头，使九千亩稻田与两万多亩旱地及附近广大的村庄、公路和飞机场得以免于水灾。此外，十七区亦从涝灾中抢救出农地四千一百五十亩。
    五十多天来，郊区村干部始终艰苦的领导农民进行战胜水灾的斗争。发扬了事事都和群众商量的民主作风，并利用开工前，歇工后的时间召集民工座谈，帮助他们认识到“修堤如同修自己的炕头一样”，是替自己办事的。纠正了部分农民的雇佣观点。使工作效率大大提高，并节省了大批人力物力。
