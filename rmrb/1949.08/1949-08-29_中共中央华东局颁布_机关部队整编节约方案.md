Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 28th: The CCP Central Committee East China Bureau promulgated the "Organ and Troop Reorganization and Savings Plan" on the 17th of this month, making detailed regulations on streamlining personnel and saving expenses, which is worthy of reference for all parts of the country. The full text of the plan is as follows:

	I. Reorganize Organizations, Reduce Personnel

	(A) Major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou:

	(1) Merge Old Organs—The military, government organs, and enterprise groups we have taken over should be merged as appropriate: those needed for future construction should be adjusted and retained; those that must be retained but are overstaffed should be reduced; those with the same business and nature should be merged; those irrelevant to current needs and future construction should be abolished; those that should be directly under the jurisdiction of the Central Government must be reported to the Central Government for handling. The above-mentioned merger measures should be proposed by each directly managed unit, reviewed by the East China Bureau, and implemented after being reported to the Central Government for approval.

	(2) Handle Old Employees—We should deal with different objects separately, explain the principles clearly, point out the way out, and handle them responsibly. Strive to win over and transform a large number of old personnel to serve the people. For personnel reduced and dismissed, a resettlement plan must be prepared in advance to avoid displacement. In handling old employees, prevent any irresponsible and dismissive tendencies. Roughly, they can be divided into the following five categories for separate handling: 1. Those who possess specialized skills and working abilities and are necessary for various production and technical units should be retained after education and review. 2. Those who possess specialized skills and working abilities but are not currently needed by the original units should be introduced to other departments or other regions for work after education and review. 3. A large number of old employees with considerable skills and working abilities should be mobilized and concentrated as much as possible, and under the leadership of educational organs, go to the countryside for training and transformation, so that they can be assigned to various counties, districts, and rural areas to participate in various construction works in the future. Their immediate family members who cannot make a living in Shanghai or cannot return to their place of origin for production, if verified, may accompany them to the countryside, with the public subsidizing necessary living expenses and helping them gradually achieve self-sufficiency. Those who are unwilling to participate in the training can be given one month's salary and dismissed to return to their hometown for production. 4. General redundant personnel without any skills can be mobilized and dismissed to return to their hometown for production, and a dismissal fee of one month's salary can be issued. Those who are indeed in difficulty and far away can be given travel expenses at discretion. Redundant personnel who have no ability and rely on the influence of relatives and friends to receive dry salary in enterprises or organs can be dismissed with reasons, generally without giving dismissal fees. 5. Individual counter-revolutionary elements or special agents who have committed heinous crimes should be expelled and dealt with according to law.

	(3) Transfer Cadres to the Countryside—Except for the cadres necessary for the urban environment, a large number of cadres should be transferred to the countryside immediately to strengthen rural work. Each unit should put forward its opinions and report them to the Municipal Party Committee for approval; and the cadres who can be transferred should be grouped and studied separately, waiting for the distribution of the East China Bureau. All localities should be handled by the Provincial Party Committee and the District Party Committee according to the above principles.

	(4) Change Personnel Establishment—Cities are different from rural areas, such as concentrated residence and office, convenient water, electricity, and transportation, so the establishment of urban organs should be changed immediately. In general, the system of individual orderlies and guards should be abolished, and civil servants should be set up by section and office (one civil servant for every fifteen or twenty people), and a unified and capable guard squad should be organized. Individual cadres can temporarily call from the guard squad when they need guards when going out. The number of messengers can be reduced. All horses owned by urban cadres should be cancelled. In addition, nurseries, kindergartens, public canteens, public hospitals, etc. can be tried to reduce nannies, cooks, and medical staff. The remaining personnel and horses in various places should be organized to go to the countryside for production; but it must be reported to the Provincial Party Committee, the District Party Committee, or the Municipal Party Committee separately in advance and executed after approval. When reorganizing the organs, the important political significance of transferring a large number of cadres to the countryside to carry out rural work should be emphasized so that all the people who go to the countryside can work with peace of mind. The old and weak cadres and old and weak service personnel who cannot go to the countryside for work must be properly handled, and no irresponsible attitude should be taken.

	(B) Inland Areas:

	(1) The Party, government, military, and civilian organs at all levels in the old areas should immediately check their personnel establishment in accordance with the regulations of the three major plans of simplification, economy, and clearing up property, which were adopted and implemented by the East China Bureau in October 1947. The agencies that must be added, such as the Communist Youth League, should formulate the establishment. The number of people currently in the agencies should be reported to the Provincial Party Committee, the District Party Committee, and the East China Bureau separately. Some overlapping organs or departments should be reduced or merged separately, and generally should not exceed the original establishment stipulated in the three major plans. Those who exceed must be reduced immediately, and those who have not exceeded the establishment but are not necessary for work need not be added. However, the original establishment can be changed if it is no longer suitable for the new situation. In the new areas, the Provincial Party Committee and the District Party Committee should quickly put forward opinions on the establishment and submit them to the East China Bureau for review and decision. Generally, after the bandits are wiped out and the order is stable, the establishment should also be in accordance with the old areas. All localities shall not arbitrarily expand the establishment in the future. The old personnel of the former special offices, counties, districts, and townships of the puppet government should be quickly mobilized and educated for separate treatment if their families are in nearby rural areas.

	(2) The East China Military Region should make a plan to quickly transfer a part of the field army on rest and reorganization to various places to carry out bandit suppression and carry out rural work. The local armed forces of each province, county, and district should follow the regulations of the Military Region and must not expand beyond the quota. The local armed forces of the consolidated areas should also be sent to the new areas to carry out bandit suppression and mobilize the masses.

	(C) Field Army:

	The number of people and horses in each army should be verified and guaranteed to be full according to the establishment of the Military Commission, but it cannot be exceeded. The old and weak should be streamlined and properly arranged for production. The phenomenon of repeated requisition of supplies by hospitals, front and rear organs, and internal visitors should be strictly checked and eliminated. Except for the expeditionary troops, the civilian workers and children's corps that have not yet been demobilized should be demobilized quickly. The field armies should also carry out practical rectification of their rear organs (such as military and political organs, factories, warehouses, hospitals, etc.). The huge rear organizations formed in the past due to the dispersed conditions of the countryside should be changed according to the current situation to save manpower, financial resources, and overcome difficulties.

	After the organs and troops have been reorganized according to the above regulations, they must often study specific methods to improve the work system and improve work efficiency.

	II. Save Financial Expenditure

	(A) Overcome the phenomenon of anarchy, disorganization, and indiscipline in financial expenditure:

	(1) Strictly abide by the established supply system, supply system and supply standards, strictly audit and allocate procedures, and shall not arbitrarily allocate expenditures beyond the system standards. All establishment fees and operating expenses outside the system standards must be approved and issued by the provincial government or the administrative office in the locality, and the troops must be approved and issued by the military region, and reported to the East China Finance and Economics Committee for record. In the future, the working funds of the Party in Shanghai will be reviewed and paid by the East China Bureau; the municipal funds will be reviewed by the East China Finance and Economics Committee and paid by the Municipal Government; the military expenses will be verified and paid by the Military Region; all expenditures within the scope of East China will be directly verified and allocated by the East China Finance and Economics Committee.

	(2) Cadres from Northeast, Central China, North China, and Northwest China who come to Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou for public affairs or medical treatment or sightseeing should provide their own expenses.

	(3) Cadres at all levels should be treated in their own hospitals when they are sick, and should not be sent to private hospitals. Those with special diseases who need to be sent to private hospitals must submit opinions from health agencies above the military or city level, and be approved by the responsible leaders of the military and government agencies at each level.

	(B) Restore the normal standard of food grains—cancel the two to four taels of grain increased according to the standard before crossing the river, and uniformly supply according to the national unified food grain standard stipulated by the Central Government.

	(C) Uniformly Adjust the Salaries of Old Personnel—The salary system is still implemented in production enterprises or technical units. Those with special technical personnel who have high salaries must be given high salaries. Those whose original salaries are not commensurate with their positions should be adjusted appropriately according to the situation. Personnel of administrative, judicial, military, police, and other organs and troops who originally received salaries still implement the salary system; those who were originally supplied by the public still implement the supply system for a certain period of time. Among them, those whose salaries are unreasonable also need to be adjusted at discretion. When adjusting the past unreasonable salaries, we should take care of technology and working ability, and oppose both excessive disparity and egalitarianism. Low-paid workers should maintain their minimum living expenses.

	(D) Save Water, Electricity, and Gasoline—Organs and troops stationed in large cities should pay attention to the following issues (there are special regulations):

	(1) Save Water and Electricity—Implement a one-lamp system per room, no more than 50 watts for office lighting and no more than 20 watts for others; elevators are not used below the fourth or third floors; redundant telephones should be removed immediately; washing clothes should be done in pools or large buckets, and well water should be used if there is well water.

	(2) Save Housing—Housing should generally be used in accordance with the regulations of the real estate management office. Offices and dormitories should be well organized, and surplus houses should be vacated for rent to increase financial income. Regarding dormitories, the central instructions must be strictly implemented: all staff members of the Party, government, military, and civilian systems working in the city must set up dormitories separately and live together if the housing conditions permit. Except for those whose families were originally in the city and have sufficient reasons, and approved by the responsible leaders of this agency, they shall not leave the dormitory. Any responsible party member shall not set up a private mansion in the public houses of the city, unless his family was originally in the city and has his own house to live in. If individual party members and non-party cadres need to set up personal mansions in the public houses of the city, they must be specially approved by the Central Government or the central representative organs.

	(3) Save Gasoline—Gasoline should be strictly allocated in accordance with the regulations (there are other regulations), and trams, buses, and bicycles should be fully utilized in the city.

	(4) Save office supplies and daily necessities, establish public reading rooms, and save newspapers, except for those who must study them specifically. Strive to simplify handling procedures and be punctual in work.

	(E) Advocate the use of old things—such as old clothes, shoes, and socks, as long as they are clean, not afraid of being old and worn. When distributing supplies, the system of handing in old things for new ones must be strictly implemented. Old things must not be lost and should be utilized. For example, envelopes can still maintain the past rural method, and the inside can be used four times for one letter.

	(F) Cherish Public Property—Especially the troops and organs entering the city should pay attention. All public houses, water and electricity equipment, furniture, etc. in the city should be managed and registered by special personnel and special agencies to prevent damage.

	(G) Oppose Pleasure-Seeking Thoughts—Since crossing the river and entering the city, pleasure-seeking thoughts have gradually risen among some cadres, which must be resolutely opposed and eliminated.

	III. Clean Up Confiscated Property

	The property confiscated in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, among which those belonging to production enterprises should still be owned by the unit and continue production; others should be turned over to the public as financial income, offset supplies, or sold to support the market, and there must be no corruption or waste. In order to carry out this work in a planned way, the East China Bureau Finance and Economics Committee decided to organize a confiscated property cleaning committee. All directly affiliated units and organs and troops should also establish such a committee to clear up the confiscated materials of each unit. For machines, raw materials, finished products, food, clothing, cloth, paper, oil, weapons, ammunition, four major military materials (medicine, electrical materials, military industry, transportation), transportation tools, gold and silver cash, housing equipment, office and daily necessities, books, antiques, etc., they must be reported level by level, stating the handling opinions. The following work should be carried out immediately:

	(1) Immediately clear up the inventory of confiscated materials and handle them according to the following principles: all those that can be sold should be organized for sale immediately (using bidding, wholesale, and door-to-door sales); some materials have been damaged or will be damaged, and materials that are not valuable and are useless to production and the army should be planned by the competent authorities, approved by the financial committee above the provincial level, and quickly handled and reported.

	(2) The four major materials required by the troops should be planned by the competent authorities, approved by the financial committee of the Provincial Party Committee and the District Party Committee, and allocated at a planned price to offset the budget of the four major materials; the excess should be properly sealed and kept. Strictly oppose the phenomenon of valuing wealth and despising materials, and arbitrarily allocating materials.

	(3) For materials that have been misappropriated without authorization, they should be immediately cleared and registered, and included in the supply tasks; and carry out criticism and self-criticism against the phenomenon of anarchy and indiscipline, so that this behavior of handling confiscated materials without authorization will not happen again.

	(4) We must be good at uniting and educating new and old warehouse staff to cherish the confiscated materials, and prevent theft, sabotage, and fire. Firearms and industrial raw materials that are prone to explosion should be quickly dispersed and stored safely.

	(5) Appoint special personnel to continue to collect materials and equipment abandoned, lost, and hidden by the enemy.

	IV. Strive for Public Enterprises to Break Even and Be Self-Sufficient

	The huge losses and subsidies of state-owned enterprises such as postal and telecommunications, railways, etc. have been a major burden on our enterprise finances. Our state-owned enterprises should be responsible for carrying out the following tasks:

	(1) Calculate the cost and profit and loss in detail and announce it to the society to clarify its advantages and disadvantages, create strong public opinion, so as to gradually adjust prices to achieve break-even and self-sufficiency.

	(2) Rely on workers, unite engineers and staff, and carry out a competition movement to save materials and improve work efficiency. Formulate production financial plans to reduce costs and narrow losses.

	(3) For the state-owned enterprises that have been taken over, they should be handled according to the following principles: 1. For public utilities such as postal, telecommunications, railways, and shipping, a fixed-term and fixed-amount subsidy system is stipulated. After a certain period of time, each unit should resolutely complete the task of self-sufficiency and even providing surplus. 2. Establish a self-sufficiency plan to make up for the deficiencies with surpluses. For example, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway supports the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. 3. Those who cannot afford to do it for a while and are not urgently needed at present can not do it; those who are currently needed but are bound to lose money for a while can postpone or reduce it. 4. It is estimated that the raw materials or sales will become a serious problem before the enemy's blockade is crushed, and they should actively plan to reduce work. 5. If the public has no ability to operate and private operation is profitable, shares can be invited for public-private joint operation or leased to private operation.

	(4) Step up the study of doing business and managing factories and enterprises, and learn to face the society or the market, instead of only knowing how to face the national treasury and banks. When funds are lacking or losses are incurred, we should strive to solve the problem by reducing costs, improving product quality and quantity, and expanding product sales.

	V. Advocate Labor Production

	In addition to reducing expenditure, the main way to solve financial problems is to strive to increase revenue. All provinces and regions should effectively rectify local tax revenue (such as slaughter, tooth stickers, house donations, etc.); Shanghai should rectify business tax, house donations, land price tax, etc. In addition, the entire Party and the entire army should advocate labor production. The Party, government, and military at all levels in the inland rural areas can engage in direct production labor such as growing vegetables, grinding flour, and transportation, according to the past experience of the old areas, to improve living conditions and reduce the burden of public supply. Now that the environment is stable, production requirements should be higher than in the past. Some garrison troops should try out the production of land reclamation (such as reclaiming wasteland and planting cotton in the Yellow River flooded area and the Subei reclamation area). In general, although agricultural labor cannot be carried out in big cities, cadres can take on more organ services themselves to reduce public miscellaneous personnel. The Sunday labor service system can also be tried out, that is, every Sunday, all cadres and miscellaneous personnel take a certain amount of time (for example, half a day) to go to state-owned factories to help with simple labor, such as transporting warehouses and cleaning factories, so that spare time can produce value.

　　中共中央华东局颁布
  　机关部队整编节约方案
    【新华社上海二十八日电】中共中央华东局本月十七日颁发“机关部队的整编节约方案”，对精简人员和节约开支作了详细的规定，值得全国各地参考。该方案全文如下：
  　壹、整编组织，紧缩人员
    （甲）京沪杭各大城市：
    （１）裁并旧机关——我接收之军政机关及企业团体，应即视情分别裁并：今后建设所需者予以调整保留；必需保留之机关而人浮于事者缩减；业务相同性质相同者合并；与目前需要及今后建设无关者裁撤；应归中央直接管辖者须请示中央处理。对上项裁并的措置，由各直管单位提出意见，经华东局审查并请示中央批准后执行。
    （２）处理旧员工——应分别对象，讲清道理，指明出路，郑重负责处理。争取和改造大批旧人员为人民服务。对裁减及遗散之人员，必须事先拟妥安置计划，以免流离失所。处理旧员工应防止一切不负责任、一脚踢开的偏向。大致可分下列五类分别处理：１、具备专门技术及工作能力，而为各生产及技术单位所必需者，应予教育审查留用。２、具有专门技术及工作能力，但目前原单位不需要者应经过教育审查介绍到其他部门或其他地区工作。３、具备相当技术及工作能力的大批旧员工，则应尽量动员集中，由教育机关率领下乡进行训练改造，以便将来分配到各县、区及农村参加各项建设工作。其直系家属，留沪无法谋生或无法返回本籍生产者，经审查属实，得随带下乡，由公家贴补必要生活费用，并扶助其逐渐达到生产自给。凡不愿参加受训者，可发给一个月薪资，遗散回乡生产。４、无一技之长的一般冗员，可动员遗散回乡生产，发给一个月薪资的遗散费。其确实困难及路远者可酌发路费。毫无能力、倚仗亲朋势力、在企业或机关中领取干薪的冗员，可说明理由裁革，一般不发给遗散费。５、个别罪大恶极的反革命分子或特务分子，应予开除法办。
    （３）抽调干部下乡——除按城市环境必需的干部外，应即抽调大批干部下乡，加强农村工作，由各单位提出意见，报告市委批准；并将可抽出的干部分别编组学习，听候华东局分配。各地由省委、区党委按上述原则处理。
    （４）改变人员编制——城市与乡村不同，如居住、办公集中，水电、交通便利，故城市机关编制应即改变。一般应取消个人的勤务员及警卫员制度，按科、室设立公务员（每十五人或二十人设一公务员），并组织统一的精干的警卫班，个别干部出外需用警卫员时，可从警卫班临时调用。通讯员可以减少。城市干部原有马匹一律取消。此外，可试办托儿所、幼稚园、公共食堂、公共医院等，以减少保姆、炊事员及医务人员。各地编余之人员、马匹，应组织到农村去进行生产；但事前须分别报告各省委、区党委或市委，经过批准后执行。在整编机关时，应强调抽调大批干部下乡开展农村工作的重要政治意义，使所有下乡人员安心工作。对不能下乡工作的老弱干部与老弱勤杂人员，必须妥善处理，不得采取任何不负责任的态度。
    （乙）内地各地区：
    （１）老区各级党政军民机关应即按照华东局在一九四七年十月通过并执行的精简、节约、清理资财三大方案的规定，检查其人员编制。必须增设之机构如青年团等应制定编制。其现有人数应分别报告省委、区党委及华东局。某些重叠机关或部门应即分别缩减裁并，一般不得超过三大方案规定之原有编制。超过者必须立即裁减，未超过编制但非工作所必须者不必添设。但原编制已不适合新情况者可以改变。新区由各省委、区党委迅速提出编制意见，交华东局审查决定。一般在散匪肃清、秩序安定后，亦应按照老区编制。各地今后不得任意扩大编制。接收原专署、县、区、乡各级伪政府的旧人员，如其家庭在附近农村，应迅速动员教育，分别处理。
    （２）由华东军区作出计划，速调休整驻防野战军的一部，分到各地进行剿匪，开展农村工作。各省、县、区地方武装，应遵军区规定，不得超额扩大。巩固地区的县区地方武装亦应派到新区担任剿匪和发动群众工作。
    （丙）野战军：
    应按军委编制，核实各军人数、马匹、保证满员，但不能超过。老弱应行精简，妥为安置生产。对医院、前后方机关及内部来往客人的重领供给现象，应严格检查与消灭。除出征部队以外，其民工、子弟兵团尚未复员的应迅速予以复员。各野战军对其后方机关（如军政机关、工厂、仓库、医院等）亦应进行切实整理。过去因农村分散条件而形成的庞大后方组织，应按目前情况加以改变，以节省人力、财力、渡过困难。
    各机关部队经过以上规定整编后，必须经常研究改善工作制度，提高工作效率的具体办法。
    贰、节省财政开支
    （甲）克服财政开支上的无政府无组织无纪律现象：
    （１）严格遵守既定的供给系统、供给制度与供给标准，严格审计、批拨手续，不能擅自批拨制度标准以外的开支。一切制度标准以外之开办费、事业费，地方须经省政府或行署、部队须经军区批准拨发，并报华东财经委员会备案。今后上海市内党的工作经费由华东局审核拨付；市政经费由华东财经委员会审核后由市政府拨付；军队费用由军区核定拨付；属华东范围之各项开支，由华东财经委员会直接核拨。
    （２）东北、华中、华北、西北各地因公或因医病或游览来京沪杭之干部，所需经费由本人自备。
    （３）各级干部有病应在自己医院医治，不得送私立医院。特殊病症需送私立医院者须经军或市以上卫生机关提出意见，由各该级军政机关负责首长批准。
    （乙）恢复食粮的正常标准——取消过江前各按标准增加的二两以至四两粮食，一律改按中央规定全国统一的食粮标准供给。
    （丙）统一调整旧人员薪给——生产企业或技术单位中仍实行薪水制，具有特殊技术人员原有高薪者须给以高薪，至原来薪职不相称者，应视情适当调整。行政、司法、军事、警察等机关人员及部队，原系领薪水者，仍实行薪水制；原系公家供给者，在若干时期内仍实行供给制。其中薪给不合理者，亦需酌情调整。在调整过去不合理的薪给时，应照顾技术与工作能力，既反对过分悬殊，也应反对平均主义。低薪者应维持其最低限度的生活费用。
    （丁）节省水电汽油——驻在大城市的机关部队，应即注意下列问题（另有专门规定）：
    （１）节省水电——实行一室一灯制，办公的不超过五十支光，其他的不超过二十支光；四楼或三楼以下不用电梯；多余的电话即应拆除；洗衣服设水池或大桶，有井水则用井水。
    （２）节省房子——对房屋一般按房产管理处规定使用，办公室与宿舍要很好组织，腾出多余房子出租，以增加财政收入。关于宿舍，必须严格执行中央指示：所有在城市中工作的党政军民各系统的工作人员，在房屋具备的条件下，须分别设立寄宿舍，集中居住。除其家庭原在本城市并有充足理由，经本机关负责首长批准者外，不得离开寄宿舍居住。任何负责党员，除其家庭原在本城，有其自己的房子居住外，不得在城市的公共房屋中设立私人的公馆。如有个别党员及非党干部，须在城市的公共房屋中设立个人公馆者，须经中央或中央代表机关特许。
    （３）节省汽油——汽油应严格依照规定配备（另有规定），在城市应充分利用电车，公共汽车及自行车。
    （４）节省办公用品及生活用品，建立公共阅报室，节省报纸，必须专门研究者例外。办事手续力求简捷，工作务须守时。
    （戊）提倡利用旧物——如旧衣服鞋袜等，但求清洁，不怕破旧。发放供给品时，须严格执行缴旧领新制度。旧物不得散失，应加以利用。例如信封，仍可保持过去农村办法，内部不妨一封四用。
    （己）爱惜公物——特别是进城的部队机关应加注意。城市的一切公共房屋、水电设备及家具等，均应有专人与专门机关管理、登记，以防损坏。
    （庚）反对享乐思想——过江进城以来，部分干部中享乐思想正逐渐抬头，必须坚决反对与清除。
    参、清理缴获资财
    我在京、沪、杭等各大城市所缴获的资财，其中属于生产企业单位的仍应归该单位所有，继续进行生产；其他应一律缴公，作为财政收入，抵充供给，或出售以支持市场，不得有任何贪污和浪费。为了有计划地进行此项工作，华东局财政经济委员会决组织缴获物资清理委员会，各直属单位和机关部队，亦应建立类此之委员会，清查各单位缴获物资。对机器、原料、成品、粮食、被服、布匹、纸张、油料、武器、弹药、军用四大器材（医药、电料、军工、交通）、交通工具、金银现款、房屋设备、办公及生活用品、图书、古物等，必须分别按级上报，说明处理意见。目前应即进行以下工作：
    （１）立即清查库存缴获物资，并按下列原则处理：凡能出售的应立即组织出售（用标卖、批发、门售等方式）；有些物资已损坏或将损坏，以及价值不大、对生产与军队无用的物资，应由各该主管机关作出计划，经省级以上财委批准，迅速处理上报。
    （２）属于部队所需的四大器材，应由各该主管机关作出计划，经省委、区党委财委会批准，有计划地作价点发，抵充四大器材的预算；过多的应妥为封存保管。严格反对重财轻物、任意支拨物资的现象。
    （３）对已擅自支拨的物资，应即清查登记，列入供给任务；并开展反无政府无纪律现象的批评与自我批评，使这种擅自处理缴获物资的行为不再发生。
    （４）要善于团结与教育新旧保管员工爱惜缴获物资，防止盗窃、破坏和失火。对军火及工业原料中容易爆炸的物品，应迅速分散妥存安全地点。
    （５）指派专门人员继续收集敌人遗弃、散失、藏匿的物资及器材。
    肆、争取公营企业保本自给
    邮电、铁路等公营事业的巨额亏损和补贴，曾是我企业财务上的一大负担。我各公营企业应即负责进行下列工作：
    （１）详细核算成本与损益，并向社会公布，阐明其利弊，造成有力舆论，以便逐渐调整价格，达到保本自给。
    （２）依靠工人，团结工程师与职员，开展节省材料、提高工作效率的竞赛运动。拟具生产的财务计划，以减轻成本，缩小亏损。
    （３）对所接收的各公营事业，目前应按下列原则处理：１、对邮政、电讯、铁路、航运等公用事业，规定定期定额的补贴制。到一定期限之后，各该单位应坚决完成自给自足，以至提供盈余的任务。２、建立以盈余补不足的自给计划。例如以京沪路养浙赣路。３、一时办不起又为目前所不急需者可不办；目前需要而一时必然赔本者可缓办或少办。４、估计在敌人封锁未被粉碎前原料或销路将成严重问题者应主动地计划减工。５、公家无力经营而私营有利者，可招股公私合营或出租给私人经营。
    （４）加紧学习做生意和管理工厂企业，要学会面向社会或市场，而不要只知面向国库和银行。资金缺乏或赔损时，应努力从降低成本、提高产品质量和数量，以及扩大产品销路来解决。
    伍、提倡劳动生产
    解决财政问题，除节流外，主要应努力开源。各省区应切实整顿地方税收（如屠宰、牙帖、房捐等）；上海应整顿营业税、房捐、地价税等。此外全党全军应提倡劳动生产。内地农村各级党、政、军，可根据过去老区经验，从事种菜、磨面、运输等直接生产劳动，以改善生活和减轻公家供应负担。现在环境安定，生产要求应比过去提高。部分驻军应试办屯垦生产（如到黄泛区、苏北垦区开荒植棉）。在大城市中一般虽不能从事农业劳动，但干部自己可多负担机关勤务，以减少公杂人员。并可试行星期日劳动服务制，即每逢星期日全体干部和杂务人员抽出一定时间（例如半日），到公营工厂帮助简单劳动，如搬运仓库、打扫厂房等，使业余时间能生产价值。
