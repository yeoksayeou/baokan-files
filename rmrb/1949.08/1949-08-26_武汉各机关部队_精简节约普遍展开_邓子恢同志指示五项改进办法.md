Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, August 25th: Since the launch of the streamlining and thrift campaign in Wuhan at the beginning of August, significant progress has been made in the past two weeks. In terms of streamlining staffing, preliminary statistics show that the CCP Central China Bureau, the Central China Military Region Headquarters and its affiliated Political Department and Logistics Department, the Central Plains Provisional People's Government, and the CCP Wuhan Municipal Committee, a total of six units, have decided to streamline 7,121 personnel, accounting for approximately 33% of the original staff. In terms of vehicles and livestock, the Military Region Headquarters, Political Department, and Logistics Department have decided to reduce 210 large, medium, and small vehicles, accounting for 68% of the original number of vehicles; reduce 75 carts, accounting for 76% of the original number; and reduce 481 livestock, accounting for 82% of the original number. In terms of savings, according to recent consolidated statistics from various agencies under the Wuhan Municipal Government and the Municipal Committee, a total of 18.7 million yuan has been saved in five categories: expenses, grain and fodder, coal and firewood, water and electricity, and gasoline in July and August. All streamlined personnel will be carefully assigned to participate in the military, rural areas, and grassroots work once the final establishment is determined. Regarding the staffing of guards, it has been decided in principle that leading cadres above the level of Deputy Minister and Deputy Secretary-General of the Central China Bureau and the Central Plains Provisional People's Government, and cadres above the division level in the military, and Deputy Secretaries and Deputy Mayors of the Wuhan Municipal Committee will each be equipped with one guard, with the remainder being civil servants. Military battalion and regimental cadres, and local prefectural and county-level cadres will be equipped with one civil servant for every four people, and cadres below this level will be equipped with one person for every 20 to 30 people. Large catering units will be equipped with an average of one cook for every 25 to 30 people, and the number of cooks can be appropriately increased for catering units with fewer people. Regarding vehicle allocation, it is stipulated that members of the Standing Committee of the Central China Bureau, the Commander and Political Commissar of the Central China Military Region, the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the Central Plains Provisional People's Government, the Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the Military Region, the Deputy Directors of the Political Department, the Minister and Political Commissar of the Logistics Department, the Minister of Military Supplies, the Deputy Secretaries and Deputy Mayors of the Wuhan Municipal Committee, the Commander and Political Commissar of the Garrison Headquarters, the President of Central Plains University, and the President and Political Commissar of the Military and Political University, will each be allocated a dedicated vehicle. Other vehicles will be allocated for official use according to rank. Gasoline allocation: 50 gallons per month for large vehicles, 40 gallons for small vehicles, any excess will not be reimbursed, and any surplus will not be recovered. The surplus vehicles and carts will be handed over to the Logistics Department and the Central China Trading Company to strengthen transportation, while the small vehicles will be sealed.

Although the streamlining and thrift campaign has achieved great results, some problems also exist. Only by solving these problems can this campaign be further developed. Comrade Deng Zihui, Political Commissar of the Central China Military Region, pointed out at the second meeting of the Streamlining and Thrift Committee that attention should be paid to improvements in the following aspects: (1) It is necessary to further continue ideological mobilization, carrying it out to every individual. Without doing this well, the movement still cannot be fully launched, and it will also affect the unity between cadres and their work morale. There are still a few leading cadres who ideologically resist streamlining and thrift, and they must be persuaded, and criticism and self-criticism must be carried out in the branch. (2) Do not indiscriminately reduce personnel without preparation. In the streamlining campaign, some enterprises and schools have already experienced abnormal phenomena of indiscriminately reducing old employees without preparation. The principle of streamlining is to tighten up the organs and enrich the grassroots; tighten up the cities and enrich the countryside; tighten up the rear and enrich the front; reduce support personnel and enrich combat personnel. This is absolutely different from the old government's "layoffs" and "demobilization," which was an irresponsible approach. In enterprises and schools, the following three types of people should generally be dismissed at present: 1. Reactionary elements; 2. Those who use nepotism, create positions based on personal connections, have no ability, and are of no use to the enterprise; 3. Those who still have serious corruption after joining the work. The remaining streamlined personnel must be properly handled or reassigned to ensure the livelihood of employees. At the same time, all public enterprises and factories must focus the streamlining and thrift on saving raw materials, reducing costs, improving production, striving for self-reliance, balancing income and expenditure, gradually expanding profits, and developing production. (3) Do not turn the streamlining and thrift campaign into a general salary reduction campaign. We are now only adjusting wages, and individual excessively high and unreasonable ones will be appropriately adjusted, and those that are too low will also be appropriately increased. Our policy is to ensure the existing living standards of workers and staff, and not to lower them. The streamlining and thrift campaign should not be understood as lowering the living standards of workers and staff, on the contrary, this is precisely to ensure the existing living standards of workers and staff. It is good that some enterprises have excessively high salaries and employees voluntarily reduce them to support the development of the enterprise. However, administrative leaders should pay attention to whether they are truly willing and whether it will excessively reduce their living standards as a result. If the impact on employees' lives is too great, the administration should still provide care and appropriately increase their wages. (4) The production and savings campaign of the Logistics Department, the Trading Company, and various public enterprise departments should focus on strengthening warehouse management and material inspection, improving the storage, transportation, and procurement of grain, ammunition, and materials. This should be combined with studying relevant documents on cherishing the property of the people and the motherland, arousing attention from the ideological level, and making everyone realize that if this aspect of work is not done well, it will cause immeasurable losses to national property. (5) Savings must be linked to production. In addition to the agencies and troops in the suburbs who can carry out vegetable growing, pig raising, etc., collective production should be carried out in a planned and organized manner according to the characteristics of the city, such as collective pig raising, duck raising, and fishing. Attention should be paid to one thing in production, that is, not to damage urban construction; for example, vegetable growing should not damage gardens, and pigs should not be raised in buildings. When cooperatives cannot be established for the time being, each streamlining branch should establish its own supply society within a week, and go to Henan, Jiangxi, and nearby rural areas in a planned manner to purchase oil, salt, vegetables, and other daily necessities. Agencies without savings can apply to the bank for production loans, the amount of which is calculated according to the number of people, not exceeding 2,000 yuan per person.

### 武汉各机关部队　精简节约普遍展开  邓子恢同志指示五项改进办法

　　武汉各机关部队
  　精简节约普遍展开
    邓子恢同志指示五项改进办法
    进一步开展精简节约
  　要继续贯彻思想动员不要形成“裁员”“减薪”
    【新华社汉口二十五日电】武汉精简节约运动自八月初开始后，半月来已有很大成绩。在紧缩编制方面，据初步统计，中共中央华中局，华中军区司令部及所属政治部、后勤部，中原临时人民政府和中共武汉市委共六个单位所属机关已决定精简七千一百二十一人，约为原有人数的百分之三十三。车辆马匹方面，军区司令部、政治部、后勤部三个单位决定减少大中小汽车二百一十辆，占原有汽车百分之六十八；裁减大车七十五辆，占原有百分之七十六；裁减牲口四百八十一匹，占原有百分之八十二。节约方面，仅据武汉市政府市委所属各机关最近综合统计，七八两个月，经费、粮秣、煤柴、水电、汽油等五项内共节约一千八百七十万元。所有精简的人员，一俟最后编制确定，即慎重分配参加部队、农村和下层工作。警卫员编制方面，原则上决定华中局、中原临时人民政府正副部长、正副秘书长以上干部，部队师级以上干部，武汉市委正副书记、正副市长各配备警卫员一人，其余均为公务员制。部队营团干部，地方的地委、县级干部每四人配备一个公务员，以下干部均为每二十至三十人配备一人。大的伙食单位，平均每二十五人至三十人配备一个炊事员，伙食单位人数少的可以酌量增加。关于车辆编制，规定华中局常委，华中军区司令员，政委，中原临时人民政府正副主席，军区正副参谋长，政治部正副主任，后勤部长、政委，军需部长，武汉市委正副书记、正副市长、警备司令部司令员、政委，中原大学校长，军政大学校长、政委，各编专车一辆。其余各按等级编制公用车。汽油配给量：大汽车每个月五十加仑，小汽车四十加仑，超过者不报销，余存者不收回。编余之汽车、大车交后勤部及华中贸易总公司以加强运输，小车则加以封存。
    精简节约运动虽然已获得很大成绩，但同时也存在着一些问题。只有解决这些问题，这个运动才能进一步开展。华中军区邓子恢政委在第二次精简节约委员会会上指出应在下列几方面注意改进：（一）要进一步继续贯彻思想动员，贯彻到每一个人。不做好这点，运动依然不能全面展开，还会影响到干部之间的团结和工作情绪。现在还有少数主要干部在思想上抵抗精简节约，须加以说服，在支部里展开批评与自我批评。（二）不要无准备、无区别地裁减人员。在精简运动中，个别企业和学校，已发生无准备无区别地裁减旧职员的不正常现象。精简的原则是紧缩机关，充实下层；紧缩城市，充实乡村；紧缩后方，充实前方；减少勤杂人员，充实战斗人员。这绝不同于旧政府的“裁员”与“复员”，那是不负责任的作法。在企业及学校中，目前一般应裁掉下面三种人：一、反动分子；二、利用裙带关系，因人设事，毫无本领，对企业毫无用处的人；三、参加工作以后仍有严重贪污行为的人。其余精简下来的人都要妥善处理或另行安插，以保证职工生活。与此同时，各公营企业工厂必须把精简节约的重点放在节省原料、降低成本、提高生产、争取自力更生、平衡收支、逐渐扩大利润、发展生产的目标上。（三）不要把精简节约运动变成普遍的减薪运动。我们现在只是调整工资，个别过高的不合理的予以适当调整，太低的还要适当提高。我们的方针是保证工人职员现有生活水准，不使降低。精简节约运动不能了解为降低工人职员的生活水平，相反的这正是为了保证工人职员的现有生活水平。有些企业薪资过高，员工自动降低，以支持企业发展，这是好的。但行政领导下应当注意到他们是否真正愿意，是否会因此使他们生活过分降低。对员工生活影响过甚者，行政上仍应予以照顾，酌量增加。（四）后勤部、贸易公司及各公营企业部门的生产节约运动，应把重点放在加强仓库管理与物资检查、改进粮弹与物资的保管、转运与采购工作上。这要结合学习有关爱护人民祖国财产的文件，从思想上引起重视，使大家认识这方面工作如果做得不好，将会使国家财产遭受无比的损失。（五）节约一定要和生产联系起来。除了郊外的机关部队可以进行种菜喂猪等等之外，应根据城市特点，有计划、有组织地来进行集体生产，如集体喂猪、喂鸭、打鱼等。生产中要注意一件事，便是不能破坏城市建设；如种菜不能破坏花园，大楼里不能喂猪。在合作社一时不能成立时，各精简分会应在一周内各自把供应社成立起来，有计划地分头到河南、江西和附近农村去采购油、盐、蔬菜及其他生活必需品等。各机关没有储蓄的，可向银行领取生产贷款，其数额按人数计算，每人以不超过二千元为度。
