　　The Education I Received at the Party Training Class
    Yang Chuan
    The one-month training period is almost over. The education I have received this month is something I did not expect when I first arrived. Because I feel that I am a completely different person before and after the training.
    First, my understanding of the Party: In the past, I only knew some of the Party's characteristics abstractly, such as the Party serves the people, it grows up in struggle, it has iron discipline and the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, etc.; but I could not connect these concepts, clearly separate what is the Party's organizational line, what is the Party's political line, and the Party's ideological foundation. What is especially important is to summarize these characteristics to the foundation of "the Party is the vanguard of the proletariat." Only the proletariat party can have dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and the correct application of this thought in China—Mao Zedong Thought; only such ideological weapons can recognize the characteristics of the Chinese revolution and determine the Party's political line in the revolution; only such a party with far-sighted political vision and a pragmatic approach, for the needs of the revolution, can generate its unique organizational form—democratic centralism and iron discipline, as well as its basic political and organizational line—from the masses, to the masses. Only such a party can withstand such arduous struggles over the past twenty-eight years, have such a glorious history, and a more glorious future. I have begun to understand these things during the training period, realizing the Party's lofty ideals and seriousness, making me stand firmly in the Party's ranks and dedicate myself to the cause of communism.
    Due to the cultivation of a bourgeois family in the past and the doting of my parents, I have a strong exploitative consciousness and individual heroism in my thinking. Precisely because of this, I made serious mistakes of selfishness and arrogance in action, always trying to overwhelm others, elevate myself, with a particularly strong desire to be a leader, loving to show off, and subjectively deciding everything; looking down on the masses, and often starting with personal interests in work motivation, etc. I don't know how many times I have been criticized in school. I wanted to change it many times. However, because I couldn't find its historical and class roots, my outlook on life never changed, so I changed it several times, but it was still the same old thing. In the Party training class, comrades reviewed each other and helped me thoroughly reflect on my personal history, origin, and the roots of my thoughts. I began to remember that almost none of my previous performances were not influenced by the old class society. I spent a week trying to figure out why individual interests should unconditionally obey collective interests? But due to the understanding of the class nature of individualism, the patient education of the old comrades and their action examples, and the gradual understanding of the greatness and hardship of the communist cause, I finally went from feeling my insignificance to feeling my selfishness and stupidity. I felt even more ashamed and ridiculous about my previous haggling over personal interests. The individualistic outlook on life was thus completely negated. I decided on a new creed of "living for work," and I felt that this transformation must be consolidated in practice. A week of hard thinking was not in vain. When the problem was solved, I felt unspeakable joy all over my body.
    At the same time, my understanding of the family was further improved in this training. I began to realize that unprincipled nostalgia for the old family is a manifestation of petty-bourgeois sentimentality. In the future, as a revolutionary soldier, I should clearly know the class status of the family, and the due distinction and relationship between the family and the revolution. I cannot shake my revolutionary stance based solely on emotion.
    After the liberation of Beiping, the Party approved my application to join the Party after carefully examining me. This is the beginning of my glorious new life. In the past, I did not pay enough attention to the importance of joining the Party, and my motivation for joining the Party also included the purpose of personal development. The comrades in the Party training class helped me review these thoughts, so that I realized that personal development can only have its own development in the development of the Party, and it should absolutely serve the interests of the Party. In a discussion, I also understood the correct relationship between individuality and Party spirit, and the difference between proletarian individuality and petty-bourgeois individuality. These new understandings helped me negate those impure motives for joining the Party, and began to establish an outlook on life that wholeheartedly strives for the revolutionary cause. After joining the Party, I am not just an ordinary person, but as a cell of the Party, I must take the Party's will as my will, and all work activities must be attributed to the interests of the Party, that is, the interests of the Chinese people and all mankind.
    The Party training class transformed me with the power of a melting pot. This month's work determined my life's path - determined to strive to become Bolshevikized. But I know that I am still very fragile, and I am too far from the Bolshevik in every aspect. Old consciousness and habits often have the possibility of revival in thought and action. In the future, I will have to continue to engage in arduous struggles in long-term work, use the interests of the Party to overcome selfish desires, and check my work and thoughts at any time. This is what I should always pay attention to after returning to school from the Party training class.

### 党训班对我的教育

　　党训班对我的教育
    杨船
    一月的训期已经快结束了。这一个月中，我得到的教育，是初来时没有想到的。因为我感到受训前后，我是两个判然不同的人。
    首先是对党的认识：从前我只抽象地知道党的一些特点，例如党是为人民服务的，是在斗争中生长起来的，有着铁的纪律和毛主席英明的领导等等；而不能把这些概念联系起来，清楚地分开那些是党的组织路线，那些是党的政治路线，和党的思想基础，而尤其重要的，是把这些特点归纳到“党是无产阶级的先锋队”的基础上去。只有无产阶级的党，才能有辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的思想，以及这思想在中国的正确运用——毛泽东思想；只有这样的思想武器，才能认清中国革命的特点，确定党在革命中的政治路线；只有这样有着远大的政治眼光而又有实事求是的党，为了革命的需要，才产生了它特有的组织形式——民主集中制和铁的纪律，以及它政治上组织上的基本路线——从群众中来，到群众中去。也只有这样一个党，才经得起二十八年来如此艰苦的斗争磨炼，有这样光辉万丈的历史，以及更光辉的前途。这些，我都在受训期中开始弄清楚些了，认识了党的崇高理想与严肃性，使我老老实实站到党的队伍里来，献身于共产主义的事业。
    由于过去资产阶级家庭的培育和父母的溺爱，我在思想上存有浓厚的剥削意识和个人英雄主义；也正因为如此，在行动上就犯了严重的自私自利与自高自大的毛病，总企图压倒别人，抬高自己，领袖欲特别强，爱出风头，主观决定一切；看不起群众，工作动机常从个人兴趣出发等等。在学校内不知受过了多少次批评，我也多少次要改，然而因为找不出它的历史的阶级的根源，人生观始终没有变，所以改了几次仍旧换汤不换药。在党训班中，同志们互相检讨，帮助我彻底反省了个人的历史、出身以及思想的根源。我开始想起从前的表现几乎无一个不是受着旧阶级的社会的影响。我曾费了一星期工夫，始终想不通为什么个人利益要无条件服从集体利益？但是由于对个人主义底阶级性的了解，由于老同志们的耐心教育以及他们的行动榜样，由于对共产主义事业的伟大性艰苦性的逐步认识，我终于由感到自己的渺小进而感到自己的自私和愚蠢，更觉得自己从前斤斤计较个人利益的可耻和可笑。个人主义的人生观就这样彻底被否定。我决定了“为工作而生活”的新信条，我感到这种转变必须在实践中去巩固。一星期的苦思总算不曾白费，当问题解决了时，全身有说不出的愉快。
    同时，对家庭的认识也在此次受训中更进了一步。我开始认识了对旧家庭无原则的留恋是小资产阶级温情主义的表现。今后，作为一个革命的战士，应该明确知道家庭的阶级地位，以及家庭和革命应有的区别和关系，不能单凭感情而动摇自己的革命立场。
    北平解放后，党在缜密地考察我之后，批准了我入党。这是我光荣新生命的开始。从前，我对入党的重要性是不够重视的，而且入党动机还包含着为了个人发展的目的。党训班的同志们帮忙我检讨这些思想，使我认识到个人的发展只能在党的发展中才能有自己的发展，而且应绝对从服党的利益。在一次讨论会上，我又了解个性与党性的正确关系，无产阶级个性与小资产阶级个性的区别。这些新的认识帮助我否定了那些不纯正的入党动机，而开始确立了全心全意为革命事业奋斗到底的人生观。入党以后，我就不单是一个普遍的人了，而是作为党的一个细胞，要把党的意志作为我的意志，一切工作活动都要归结到党的利益，也就是中国人民与全人类的利益上去才对。
    党训班以熔炉一样的力量改造了我。这一个月工夫决定了我一生的路途——决心要努力走向布尔塞维克化。但我知道目前我还十分脆弱，无论那方面距离布尔塞维克都太远了，旧意识习惯在思想行动中常有复活的可能，今后还要在长期的工作中不断地进行艰苦的斗争，用党的利益克服自私的欲望，随时检查自己的工作和思想。这就是我从党训班回到学校后经常要注意的事。
