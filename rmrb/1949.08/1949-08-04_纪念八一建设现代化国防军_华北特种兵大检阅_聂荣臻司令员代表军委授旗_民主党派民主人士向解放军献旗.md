    North China Special Forces Grand Review
    Commander Nie Rongzhen Presents Flags on Behalf of the Military Commission
    Democratic Parties and Personages Present Flags to the People's Liberation Army
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Special Forces of the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a grand rally yesterday morning (the 3rd) at their garrison in Beiping to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army and to conduct a flag-presentation ceremony. General Nie Rongzhen, Commander of the North China Military Region, personally reviewed the troops and presented flags on behalf of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, non-party democratic人士 (personages), the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the China National Salvation Association, the Sanmin Zhuyi Comrades Association, the China Kuomintang Democratic Promotion Association, and the China Zhi Gong Party jointly presented flags to the Chinese People's Liberation Army at the meeting to pay their respects. The Beiping Municipal People's Representative Delegation also presented flags to the Special Forces. Guests attending the conference included democratic personages in Ping such as Li Jishen, Li Dequan, Zhang Bojun, Huang Yanpei, Guo Moruo, Ma Xulun, Peng Zemin, Tan Pingshan, Cai Tingkai, Chen Qiyou, and representatives from various organs and organizations in Ping, administrative cadre schools, and over two thousand members of the summer study groups of college and middle school students.
    At 9:00 AM, the conference began with a thirty-six-gun salute. First, the flag presentation ceremony was held. Amidst solemn military music, Commander Nie personally presented four military flags to the Special Forces, and the entire audience cheered enthusiastically. This was followed by a military parade, which included tank units, anti-aircraft artillery units, mechanized artillery units, and engineering units. This modern national defense force shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!" during the review.
    After the parade, Commander Nie took the stage to speak. He emphasized that we have achieved today's victory after twenty-two years of fighting, and this is due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, especially Chairman Mao's brilliant strategy and great military-building thought, which armed the Chinese People's Liberation Army, making it invincible throughout the country. He said: In the early years of the People's Liberation Army, the enemy bullied us for lacking modern technology and used fortress tactics to block us. Later, the Japanese also used this approach, but the People's Liberation Army used weapons seized from the enemy to organize its own powerful artillery, and the enemy's fortresses were destroyed one by one in front of us. The so-called fortress blockade became a historical term. In China, the so-called impregnable fortresses were all taken down by us, some without even fighting. Our strength has become invincible and indestructible; we are both brave and have technology. He pointed out that the Special Forces have made many contributions in the Liberation War, and today's task is to continue learning, improve technology, eliminate guerrilla habits, and move towards regularization. We believe that with twenty-two years of rich combat experience and the guidance of Chairman Mao's military-building thought, we can build a strong national defense force that combines technology with bravery to defend the new democratic republic.
    After Commander Nie's speech, the democratic parties presented flags to the People's Liberation Army, with the large characters "With August 1st, the nation can be independent; with August 1st, the people can be liberated; with August 1st, democracy and peace can be guaranteed" embroidered on the flags. Commander Nie accepted the flags on behalf of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Beiping People's Representative Delegation presented the Special Forces with a banner embroidered with the words "People's Armed Force." At this point, all officers and soldiers of the Special Forces solemnly swore: We will fight forever to defend the people's victory. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will study hard, improve our military technology, political and cultural level, and regular army qualities, and strive to build a regularized and modernized Special Forces.
    Li Jishen delivered a speech on behalf of the democratic parties, pointing out that the establishment of the People's Liberation Army aims to eliminate the aggressive forces of imperialism in order to seek the liberation of the Chinese nation, and to eliminate the oppressive forces of feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism in order to seek the liberation of the Chinese people. Over the past twenty-two years, due to the brave fighting of the People's Liberation Army, Japanese imperialism has been overthrown, and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique has been overthrown, freeing the Chinese people from deep water and scorching fire. He said: The People's Liberation Army is strictly disciplined, and wherever it goes, it not only does not violate the slightest thing belonging to the people but also protects the people and helps them with their work, which is truly loved by the people from the bottom of their hearts. He said: The People's Liberation Army has reversed the situation in China, making China's international status unprecedentedly high. He believes that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the People's Liberation Army will become a national defense force that can defeat any imperialist aggression and a powerful defender of world peace.
    Guo Moruo said in his speech that the August 1st Army Day is the most glorious and great commemorative day in our Chinese revolutionary history. After twenty-two years of arduous struggle, the People's Liberation Army has become an incomparably strong steel army, growing from 40,000 to 4 million troops. Our People's Liberation Army is not only a guarantee of democracy for the Chinese people but also a guarantee of peace for the world. We must make this glory even greater, expand the achievements of army building into achievements of nation-building, dig out the old roots of imperialism and feudalism from China, consolidate our national defense, and complete the task of building a new democracy under the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
    Zhang Xiaomei, representing the Beiping People's Representative Delegation, delivered a speech, thanking the People's Liberation Army for their heroic fighting in liberating and protecting the people of the whole country.
    The conference ended in enthusiastic shouts of slogans, and then combat performances began. The shells of the anti-aircraft machine guns continuously flew into the sky, accurately exploding around the imaginary target – "sky lanterns." During the engineering unit's "blasting" performance, two loud explosions shattered two fortresses. The tank performance brought even greater excitement to the audience. Columns of tanks of various types changed formations in place and in motion, broke through minefields, and destroyed huge bunkers. The sound of steel and motors caused wild cheers and applause throughout the audience.

    纪念八一建设现代化国防军
    华北特种兵大检阅
    聂荣臻司令员代表军委授旗
    民主党派民主人士向解放军献旗
    【本报讯】中国人民解放军华北军区特种兵部队，于昨（三）日上午在北平驻地举行人民解放军诞生二十二周年纪念暨授旗典礼大会。华北军区司令员聂荣臻将军亲临检阅，并代表中国人民革命军事委员会授旗。中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟、中国民主建国会、无党派民主人士、中国民主促进会、中国农工民主党、中国人民救国会、三民主义同志联合会、中国国民党民主促进会、中国致公党等联合在会上向中国人民解放军献旗致敬。北平市各界人民代表团亦向特种兵部队献旗。参加大会的来宾有在平的民主人士李济深、李德全、章伯钧、黄炎培、郭沫若、马叙伦、彭泽民、谭平山、蔡廷锴、陈其尤等及平市各机关团体代表，行政干部学校，大中学生暑期学习团团员二千余人。
    上午九时，大会在三十六响礼炮声中开始。首先举行授旗式，在隆重的军乐声中，聂司令员亲自授予特种兵部队军旗四面，全场热烈欢呼。接着举行阅兵式，受检阅的包括战车部队，高射炮部队，机械化炮兵部队及工兵部队。这支近代化的国防军，受检阅时高呼“毛主席万岁”、“朱总司令万岁”。
    阅兵完毕，聂司令员登台讲话：他着重指出，我们经过二十二年的战斗，获得今天的胜利，这是由于中国共产党的正确领导，特别是毛主席的英明战略与伟大的建军思想，武装了中国人民解放军，使得人民解放军打遍全国无敌手。他说：在人民解放军幼年时期，敌人曾欺负我们缺乏近代技术，用堡垒战术封锁我们。以后日本人也曾经运用这一套，但是人民解放军利用缴自敌人的武器，组织了自己的强大炮兵，敌人的堡垒便在我们面前一个一个摧毁了。所谓堡垒封锁便成了历史上的名词了。在中国所谓不可攻克的要塞，都被我们打下了，有的不打也下了。我们的力量变得无攻不克无坚不摧，我们是英勇又加上了技术。他指出：特种兵部队曾在解放战争中立了许多功绩，今天的任务就是继续学习，提高技术，取消游击习气，向正规化迈进。我们相信，有二十二年丰富的战斗经验和毛主席建军思想的指导，以技术配合英勇，就可建设成一支强大的国防军，保卫新民主主义的共和国。
    聂司令员讲话后，各民主党派向人民解放军献旗，旗上绣着“有了八一，民族才能独立；有了八一，人民才能翻身；有了八一，民主和平才能保障”的大字。由聂司令员代表中国人民解放军受旗。北平各界人民代表团向特种兵部队献上绣着“人民武力”大字的锦旗。至此，特种兵部队全体指战员举行庄严的宣誓：我们要为保卫人民的胜利果实而永远战斗。在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，努力学习，提高军事技术、政治、文化水平、正规建军素养，为建设正规化现代化的特种兵而斗争。
    李济深代表各民主党派在会上致词；他指出人民解放军的建立，目的在扫除帝国主义的侵略势力以求中华民族的解放，扫除封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫势力以求中国人民的解放。二十二年来由于人民解放军的勇敢战斗，打倒了日本帝国主义，打倒了蒋介石反动集团，出中国人民于水深火热之中。他说：人民解放军纪律严明，所到之处，不只是秋毫无犯，并且保护老百姓，帮助老百姓做事，实在使人民衷心爱戴。他说：人民解放军打转了中国的局面，使中国的国际地位空前提高了。相信在毛主席和朱总司令领导之下，人民解放军会成为击退任何帝国主义侵略的国防军，成为世界和平有力的保卫者。
    郭沫若致词时说，八一建军节是我们中国革命史上最有光辉的一个伟大纪念日。经过二十二年艰苦的斗争，人民解放军已成为一支坚强无比的钢铁部队，由四万人发展到四百万大军。我们人民解放军不仅是中国人民民主的保障，而且是全世界和平的保障。我们要把这光荣愈加光大，把建军成就扩大成建国成就，把帝国主义和封建主义的老根挖出中国去，巩固我们的国防，在中国共产党和毛主席坚强的领导下，完成新民主主义的建国任务。
    北平市各界人民代表团张晓梅代表致词，感谢人民解放军的英勇作战，解放与保卫了全国的人民。
    大会在热烈的口号声中结束，旋即开始战斗表演。高射机关炮的炮弹连续飞上天空，准确的在假想标的——“空明灯”的左右纷纷爆炸。工兵“爆破”表演时，轰然两声巨响，把两个堡垒炸得粉碎。战车表演带给观众更大的兴奋。成列的各型坦克在原地与在行进中变换各种队形，突破地雷阵，冲毁巨大碉堡。钢铁与摩托的声音，引起全场狂热的欢呼鼓掌。
