　　Counties Under Taiyuan
  　Actively Prepare for Wheat Planting
  　Sowing Area to be Expanded by One-Quarter
    [This Newspaper’s Report] The Shanxi Daily recently reported on agricultural activities in the Taiyuan area in July, stating that the vast rural areas of Taiyuan spent July busily carrying out summer weeding and fighting against hail and flood disasters. Autumn crops have entered the third weeding stage, and cash crops such as cotton have generally been weeded four times or more. In mid-July, continuous heavy rains occurred in various places, with the two periods from the 5th to the 11th and around the 25th of the latter half of the month being the most severe. In all 23 counties in the district and some villages in the suburban area of Taiyuan City suffered from floods due to river dike breaches and mountain torrents, affecting more than 50,000 mu of land. The main reason for this was the serious losses suffered by the masses due to the negligence of the leaders of various counties. After the disaster occurred, Dingxiang, Qingyuan, Jinyuan, Wenshui, Xugou, Taigu and other counties established flood control headquarters, under the unified leadership of responsible party and government cadres, who personally took action to vigorously organize the masses to carry out flood control work.
    Currently, the entire district is completing the third weeding of autumn fields and has begun preparations for sowing winter wheat. The Taiyuan Municipal Government has issued instructions requiring all special districts and counties to expand the area sown to wheat this autumn by one-quarter, striving to complete the sowing of 2.5 million mu of winter wheat. This summer's wheat harvest was poor, especially in the new districts where seeds and animal power are scarce. Jinyuan County in the Second Special District plans to sow 80,000 mu of wheat. Based on 7 sheng per mu, a total of 5,600 shi of seeds are needed. 20% to 30% of farmers do not have winter wheat seeds this year, and even those who have wheat have had their wheat spoiled by the prolonged rain. Therefore, the extent to which the seed problem is resolved is the main key to how much wheat is sown this year. All counties are currently paying attention to solving problems related to animal power, seeds, fertilizer, and wheat stubble land for sowing. In the villages in the new district where land reform was carried out this year, some of the masses, due to the rumors spread by landlords, Taoist priests, and religious figures, believe that the land they have been allocated is not secure and are afraid to apply fertilizer and sow wheat, fearing further changes in the autumn. This kind of concern is even greater in areas where land reform has not yet been carried out. All counties have strengthened propaganda work in accordance with the instructions issued by the Municipal Government on July 9, emphasizing in areas where land reform has not yet been carried out that whoever sows this year will still harvest next year. In land reform areas, the regulations for the transfer of land ownership after the summer harvest based on "whoever sows, reaps" which were implemented during the land reform last winter and this spring, should continue to be enforced. Where land ownership has not yet been transferred, it should be immediately transferred to the land recipients, and mountain land rights holders should receive and cultivate the land, resolving the masses' disputes and doubts about sowing wheat.

### 太原所属各县　积极准备种麦　将扩大播种面积四分之一

　　太原所属各县
  　积极准备种麦
  　将扩大播种面积四分之一
    【本报讯】山西日报顷报导太原区七月份农事活动称：太原区的广大农村，在七月份是紧张进行夏锄并全力与雹灾水灾进行斗争的一月。秋禾已进入三次锄苗，经济作物棉花一般已锄到四次以上。七月中各地连续大雨，以五日至十一日及下旬二十五日前后两次最重，全区二十三个县及太原市郊区部分村庄，均因河堤决口山洪暴发，五万亩以上田地受灾，主要原因是由于各县领导上的麻痹大意所造成群众的严重损失。灾情发生后，定襄、清源、晋源、文水、徐沟、太谷等县均已成立了防汛指挥部，由党政负责干部统一领导，亲自动手，大力组织群众进行防汛工作。
    目前在全区正进行完成秋田锄三遍，并已开始准备播种宿麦的工作。太原市政府已发出指示，要求各专、县扩大今秋种麦面积四分之一，为完成二百五十万亩宿麦播种而努力。今年夏季麦田歉收，特别在新区种籽畜力甚缺。二专区晋源县全县计划种麦八万亩，按每亩七升计算，共需种籽五千六百石，有百分之二十到三十的农户今年没有种宿麦，即有麦的农户也因久雨把麦子沤坏，因此麦籽问题解决的程度，是今年种麦多少的主要关键。各县现正注意解决有关种麦的畜力、种籽、施肥及刈麦地等问题。在新区今年进行过土地改革的村庄，有部分群众因地主、道门、教门的谣言煽惑，认为自己所分得的土地不保险，不敢上粪种麦，恐怕秋后再有变动。未土改地区此种顾虑更大。各县已根据市政府七月九日指示，加强宣传工作，未土改地区强调今年谁种明年仍归谁收的宣传。土地改革地区则仍执行去冬今春土改时已分配之麦地按“谁种谁收”夏收后转移地权的规定，凡地权尚未转移者应即转移给得地户，山地权所有人接收耕种，解决群众对种麦的纠纷和疑虑。
