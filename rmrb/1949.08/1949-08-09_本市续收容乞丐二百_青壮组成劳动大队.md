    The City Continues to Shelter 200 Beggars; Able-bodied Young People Form Labor Brigade
    [This City News] The city's Beggar Handling Committee convened a meeting on July 27th, deciding to continue sheltering and reforming scattered beggars roaming the streets. From July 28th to the 5th of this month, a total of 208 beggars were taken in. They were given placement or production learning opportunities according to their individual circumstances. Twenty-one people were taken in by the nursery, three by the women's reformatory, seventy by the old people's home, eleven by the handicraft workshop, and the remaining 103 able-bodied young people were organized into a labor brigade to engage in production learning. After the sheltering concluded on the 5th, the labor brigade was formally established on the 6th, and a conference was held. Team member representative Zhou Xin and recounted at the meeting the various sufferings inflicted upon them by the Kuomintang reactionaries, expressing that "We must labor hard to repay the care and attention of the superiors." In recent days, thanks to the care in their lives and ideological education, the team members have been studying and working with peace of mind. A few days ago, forty-two team members went to the Civil Affairs Bureau warehouses and dormitories in Beichizi and Beichang Street to work, showing great enthusiasm. They also formulated nine rules of life, striving to "overcome parasitic thoughts, study diligently, strengthen production, and strive to be labor heroes."
