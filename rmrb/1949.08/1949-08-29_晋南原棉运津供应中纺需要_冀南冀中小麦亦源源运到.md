[Tianjin News] Raw cotton produced in the southern Shanxi triangular area is being transported to Tianjin in succession. In May, after the Shanxi Southern Shanxi Trading Company transported more than 600,000 jin of cotton, in mid-July the company negotiated with Tianjin Municipal Trading Company Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company to transport cotton from southern Shanxi to Tianjin in exchange for yarn and cloth. Nearly one million jin has already arrived, with another 200,000 jin en route. The company transports the exchanged yarn and cloth (a portion of it) to the Northeast to exchange for transportation equipment, and all the remaining cloth is dyed and transported back to Shanxi. In addition, the company's required burlap sacks, gasoline, enamel utensils, etc., are also purchased through the Tianjin Trust Company. The two batches of raw cotton will be delivered to the Tianjin branch of China Textile.

[Another News] During the summer season, Tianjin's consumption of fine grains is relatively high. In order to ensure a sufficient supply of fine grains, the Trading Company has successively transferred a large quantity of wheat to Tianjin from central and southern Hebei. On the 22nd of this month, 623,370 jin of wheat were collected and transported from Yuancun, southern Hebei. Afterward, on the 26th, more than 42,000 jin were transported. The 323,200 jin of wheat recently allocated by the state-owned Yudong Company of central Hebei also arrived on the same day. The above were all transported to Tianjin via river routes. In addition, the larger cargoes recently transported on the river route include: 3,000,000 jin of salt transported to Xin County (transferred from Linqing) on August 25th; 2,000,000 jin of grains transported to Duancun on the Daqing River section on the 13th, and another 600,000 jin transported to Zangqiao. Due to continuous rain in the upper reaches of the Daqing and Ziya Rivers in the past month, agricultural crops have been slightly damaged. The grain transported there is for disaster relief purposes.

　　晋南原棉运津供应中纺需要
  　冀南冀中小麦亦源源运到
    【天津讯】晋南三角地带产棉正陆续运津。五月间，由山西晋南贸易公司运来棉花六十余万斤后，七月中旬该公司又与津市贸易公司花纱布公司商妥，由晋南运来棉花，到天津交换纱布，现已运到近百万斤，尚有二十万斤在启运中。该公司将所换得的纱布（一部分）运到东北去交换交通器材，其余布匹悉数染色后运回山西。另外该公司所需的麻袋、汽油、搪瓷用具等亦通过本市信托公司购得，二批原棉将交津中纺分公司。
    【又讯】夏令期间津市细粮消耗量较多，贸易公司为保证细粮的充分供给，曾先后由冀中、冀南一带调拨大批小麦来津，本月二十二日曾由冀南元村集运来小麦六十二万三千三百七十斤。之后，于二十六日，又运来四万二千多斤。最近由冀中国营裕东公司拨来之三十二万三千二百多斤小麦，亦于同日抵达，以上皆系通过河路运津者。此外，最近河路上水货物较大宗者：八月二十五日运赴新县（由临清转）的三百万斤食盐；十三日运往大清河段村的谷类二百万斤，另外尚有运赴臧桥的六十万斤。按在大清、子牙两河上流，月来遍遭霪雨，农作微受损害，运去粮食，系属救灾性质。
