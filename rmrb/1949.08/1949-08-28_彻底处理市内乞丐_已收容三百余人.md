　　Thoroughly Addressing the City's Beggars
  　Over 300 People Have Been Taken In
    [This City News] In order to implement the resolution of the People's Representatives Conference on thoroughly addressing the issue of beggars in the city, the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau convened a joint meeting of the heads of urban and suburban districts and the heads of public security sub-bureaus on the 18th of this month. It was decided to continue taking in the scattered beggars who reappear on the streets after two rounds of collection, in order to gradually eliminate them. After the meeting, district offices and public security police stations in each district increased the number of cadres and began to carry out this surprise task. As of the 26th, 327 people had been taken in during the past nine days. This work is still ongoing. (Municipal Government News Office)
