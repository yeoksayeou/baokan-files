New District Grain Collection Experience
　Rely on the Masses, Mobilize the Masses, Strike at Concealed Land, and Suppress Bandits

　　After the grain collection work began in various regions, landlords and local bullies used various methods to carry out conspiratorial sabotage activities. Some concealed large amounts of land, shifting the burden to middle and poor peasants; others colluded with former Bao-Jia personnel to deceive the masses, attempting to create collective land concealment throughout the village. Zhang Mingxuan, a large landlord in Xishui County, feigned enlightenment at the beginning of the grain collection, first offering twenty shi of rice. After thorough investigation, according to the principle of reasonable burden, he should have contributed 13,000 jin of public grain, but what he offered was only one-eighth of this amount. In several regions, incidents of local bullies and bandit-spies firing black guns and robbing public grain occurred; other despicable means, such as spreading rumors and sabotage, feigning poverty, and using "honey traps" and money to lure our working cadres, emerged endlessly. These facts show that grain collection work is a complex and acute class struggle, and we must rely on the masses and mobilize the masses. Wuchang County combined grain collection with bandit suppression, successively cracking several cases of bandit-spies robbing and harassing, which smoothly unfolded the grain collection work. Huangpi County adopted the method of breaking through key points to promote the overall situation. First, it concentrated a large number of cadres in four districts, went deep among the masses to understand the situation, cultivated peasant activists, and organized grain collection backbone groups. Then, it established a democratic evaluation meeting, explaining to the masses the principles of "one person concealing land, everyone suffers" and "landlords concealing land, peasants suffer," and launched a mass land investigation movement, striking at the landlords' and local bullies' conspiracy to conceal land and shift the burden, so that the burden was initially fair and reasonable. Due to the implementation of this method, the morale of the masses was greatly improved, and a wave of grain delivery was set off. In half a month, the six districts of the county uncovered more than 8,100 shi of concealed land, collected more than 3 million jin of wheat, and cultivated more than 2,000 peasant activists, laying a good foundation for the establishment of farmers' associations and further mobilization of the masses in the future.

　　However, individual regions and a few cadres lacked a correct understanding of the grain collection work, underestimated the destructive conspiracies of landlords and local bullies, and failed to seriously study and implement the policy of reasonable burden, resulting in great losses in the work. These cadres generally have three tendencies: The first is to regard grain collection work as merely asking the masses for things, believing that the masses cannot be mobilized through grain collection; therefore, a tendency to become detached from the masses, relying solely on Bao-Jia personnel, and using administrative orders for apportionment has emerged; the destructive behavior of landlords, local bullies, and their henchmen has not been met with mobilization of the masses to strike at them, causing landlords and rich peasants to take advantage of various loopholes to conceal their land and resist the grain collection work. The second is the existence of a simple "task" viewpoint, believing that the grain collection task is urgent, and that the masses will be mobilized after the grain collection is completed, resulting in the erroneous tendency of disregarding policies and forcibly apportioning tasks in the work. The third is that a few cadres are afraid of fighting against feudal evil forces, and are even confused by the disguises and enticements of landlords, losing their stand, and arbitrarily reducing the burden for landlords, and even speaking for landlords at mass meetings, fueling the arrogance of the landlords and arousing the dissatisfaction of the peasants. Therefore, in individual regions, the task of grain collection has not yet been completed.

　　新区征粮经验
  　依靠群众发动群众打击瞒田清剿土匪
    各地征粮工作开始后，地主、恶霸曾利用各种方法进行阴谋破坏活动。有的大量瞒田，将负担转嫁给中贫农；有的更勾结旧保甲人员，欺骗群众，企图制造全村集体瞒田。浠水县大地主张明轩在刚开始征粮时，伪装开明，首先拿出稻谷二十石。经深入调查后，按合理负担原则，应出公粮一万三千斤，所拿出者仅抵此数的八分之一。若干地区发生恶霸和土匪特务打黑枪和抢劫公粮等事件，其他造谣破坏、装穷、用“美人计”和金钱引诱我工作干部等等卑鄙手段，更是层出不穷。这些事实说明了征粮工作是一种复杂和尖锐的阶级斗争，必须依靠群众，发动群众。武昌县把征粮与剿匪结合起来，连续破获了土匪特务抢劫骚扰案数起，使征粮工作顺利展开。黄陂县采取突破重点推动全面的办法，首先把大批干部集中在四个区内，深入到群众中去了解情况，培养农民积极分子，组织征粮骨干小组，然后成立民主评议会，向群众说明“一人瞒田，大家吃亏”，“地主瞒田，农民吃亏”的道理，开展了群众性查田运动，打击了地主恶霸瞒田转嫁的阴谋，使负担做到初步公平合理。由于实行了这种办法，群众情绪大大提高，掀起了缴粮热潮。该县六个区在半个月内即查出八千一百多石瞒田，征收了三百余万斤小麦，并培养出二千多个农民积极分子，为今后建立农会和进一步发动群众打下了良好的基础。
    但个别地区和少数干部对征粮工作缺乏正确认识，对地主恶霸的破坏阴谋估计不足，对合理负担政策亦未认真研究和执行，致使工作遭到很大的损失。这些干部大体存在着三种倾向：第一种是把征粮工作看成只是向群众要东西，认为不能通过征粮来发动群众；因此产生脱离群众，单纯依靠保甲人员，用行政命令进行摊派的偏向；对地主恶霸及其爪牙的破坏行为，也未能发动群众予以打击，致使地主富农利用各种空隙，瞒报田地，对抗征粮工作。第二种是存在着单纯的“任务”观点，认为征粮任务紧迫，等征完粮后再发动群众，造成在工作中不顾政策和强行摊派的错误倾向。第三种是少数干部害怕与封建恶势力作斗争，甚至为地主的伪装和利诱所迷惑，丧失了立场，擅自为地主减轻负担，有的并在群众大会上替地主讲情，助长了地主的凶焰，引起了农民的不满。因此，在个别地区，征粮的任务至今未能完成。
