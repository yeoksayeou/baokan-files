Serious warlordism style
Violating reliance on the working class
Huaibei Military Region Logistics Department cadre Qi Keqin dismissed
[Our newspaper's report] The Huaibei Military Region Logistics Department listened to the reflections of the workers at the clothing warehouse under its jurisdiction in Xiaxie Street, Ping City. After further investigation, it was confirmed that Qi Keqin, a cadre at the warehouse, had a serious warlordism style, showed no concern for the workers, and allowed foreman Wang Shoushan and others to unreasonably exploit and create difficulties for the workers in various ways. In addition to the decision to dismiss Qi Keqin and Wang Shoushan from their posts, the department is preparing to send capable cadres to the warehouse to convene a workers' meeting to explain the situation to the workers and order Qi and Wang to apologize to the workers and admit their mistakes.

Since Qi Keqin arrived at the clothing factory, he has often nitpicked, clashed, and scolded the workers unreasonably, making them work in the scorching sun and rain, and not allowing them to move around, completely disregarding the workers' welfare. When workers offered him suggestions, he not only did not reflect on himself, but also said that those who made suggestions were troublemakers. This fully demonstrated the Kuomintang style of being detached from the masses and losing the proletarian stance. The foremen, seeing that the cadre was acting like this, dared to continue to treat the workers with the ruling methods of the Kuomintang era, such as deducting workers' wages, creating difficulties for workers when they submitted work and received wages, and acting like overlords.

These phenomena aroused widespread dissatisfaction and complaints among the workers at the warehouse. The Huaibei Military Region Logistics Department believes that Qi Keqin's bad style completely violated the basic stance and traditional spirit of relying on the working class, uniting the working people, contacting the broad masses, learning from them, and educating them, and demonstrated the Kuomintang style of being detached from the masses and oppressing the masses. The bad behavior of Wang Shoushan and others in exploiting and deducting workers' wages is especially intolerable under the New Democratic regime. Therefore, the department decided to dismiss them both in order to rectify discipline, educate them, and educate everyone.

    严重军阀主义作风
    违背依靠工人阶级
    华北军区后勤部干部祁克勤撤职
    【本报讯】华北军区后勤部听取了该部驻平市下斜街被服仓库工人的反映，又经多方调查，确知该库干部祁克勤严重的军阀主义作风，对工人群众毫不关心，并放任工头王寿山等无理剥削与多方刁难工人，除已决定予祁克勤王寿山以撤职处分外，并准备即派得力干部，赴该库召开工人大会，向工人进行解释，并令祁、王二人向工人道歉，承认错误。
    祁克勤自到被服厂以来，对工人常常无理挑剔、冲突吵骂，让工人在烈日、雨中工作，不准挪换地方，完全漠视工人的福利。工人向他提意见，他不惟不自检讨，反说提意见者是捣乱分子。充分表现了脱离群众、失掉无产阶级立场的国民党作风。工头们看到干部还这样作，也就敢于继续用国民党时代的统治办法对待工人，例如克扣工人工资，在工人交活计、领工资时极为刁难，作威作福等等。
    这些现象引起该库工人普遍的不满和抱怨，华北军区后勤部认为：祁克勤的恶劣作风完全违背了依靠工人阶级，团结劳动人民，联系广大群众，向他们学习而又教育他们的基本立场和传统精神，表现了脱离群众、压迫群众的国民党作风。王寿山等剥削、克扣工人的恶劣行为，在新民主主义政权下尤属不能容忍，因此该部决定将他们两人撤职，以整肃纪律，教育他们并教育大家。
