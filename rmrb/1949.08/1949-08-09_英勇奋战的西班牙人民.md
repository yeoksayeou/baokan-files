    The Heroic Struggle of the Spanish People
    Féngdí'nánduō Kèláodīng, Member of the Political Bureau of the Spanish Communist Party
    (Continued)
    The British "Times" of December 20, 1948, published a Spanish dispatch saying: Criticism can be heard everywhere, and it is very open. The "New York Times" published a letter from a Spanish visitor on December 10, 1948, who wrote: This country has been sharply divided into a minority of extreme right-wingers on one end and the vast majority of extreme left-wingers on the other.
    In this situation, the Communist Party's underground organization is firmly united with the masses around it. Despite the brutal repression, the Communist Party is increasingly closely linked to the people. In order to overthrow the Franco regime, the Spanish Communist Party is striving to raise the political consciousness of the working class and the entire people, and to unite and organize all the forces of the people.
    In recent weeks, the Franco government has used the destruction of the Madrid-Barcelona train as an excuse to intensify its campaign of terror and repression. On February 14, newspapers and radio stations simultaneously issued statements falsely claiming that the Communist Party was responsible for this sabotage.
    After spreading this absurd rumor, the reactionary newspapers and radio stations immediately began a propaganda campaign calling for "cruel arrests and the destruction of all enemy organizations," of course, especially against the Communist Party. Thus, after the malicious propaganda they had created, the four heroic Communist Party members—Carrillo, Valverde, Puigdemont, and Mestre—who had been sentenced to death four months earlier, were shot in Barcelona.
    In the Ocana prison, the famous trade union leader José Sadue was sentenced to death after only a hasty trial. In Seville, the heroic fighters Mario and López Quiles, accused of reorganizing the Communist Party in Andalusia, are also in grave danger. In Zaragoza, executioners are planning to murder Emilio Vistué, who was accused of reorganizing the Communist Party in Aragon. In Bilbao, Saturnino López and other anti-fascists have been sentenced to death. In Madrid, three anti-fascists were recently sentenced to death by a military tribunal. Throughout the country, the families of those considered "suspects" are being subjected to searches and robberies. In prisons, prominent Communist Party members and anti-fascists are being singled out for trial by military tribunals.
    Unless the democratic forces of the world act immediately to rescue these heroic and unyielding fighters, they will soon be murdered.
    The Republican and workers' parties of Spain have sent a telegram to the United Nations, demanding that the Franco regime be stopped from this barbaric terror and that the lives of those imprisoned fighters be rescued. Signed on the telegram were the Republican Union (Chairman Martínez Barrio, in exile), the Left Republican Party (Chairman Albornoz, Prime Minister of the Republican government in exile), the Catalan Left Republican Party, the Republican Union Party, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (as opposed to the right-wing opportunists led by Prieto), the National Confederation of Labor, the Catalan United Socialist Party, and the Spanish Communist Party.
    Their call represents the will of the vast majority of democratic forces within Spain and is unanimously and enthusiastically supported by the democratic forces striving for peace and democracy and against the instigators of a new war.
    The new wave of terror in Spain by Franco's suppression of the democratic movement is closely related to the desire of the imperialist bloc to make Spain a strategic, military, and political base. The United States needs Franco to "rehabilitate" Spain, thereby making it possible for the Franco government to openly participate in the Mediterranean and Atlantic pacts and even become a member of the United Nations. To achieve this goal, they are planning to cooperate with the right-wing socialist and anarchist leaders, who are willing to serve imperialism and Spanish reactionaries, to restore the monarchy and preserve the power of the dictatorship.
    While this political force is preparing to openly pull Spain into the orbit of the American "satellite," military activities are also proceeding rapidly. Under the supervision of a military delegation sent by the U.S. General Staff, in accordance with a long-standing agreement with the United States, airfields are being built, military ports are being rebuilt, military highways are being opened, fortifications are being built in the Pyrenees, and uranium mines are being exploited. The Franco government has not only sold Spain to Wall Street as a military base and strategic resource but has also offered millions of soldiers as cannon fodder for an anti-Soviet war; however, the vast people's angry attitude towards these acts of betrayal has greatly alarmed the Franco reactionary group.
    The Spanish people see more and more clearly that the Soviet Union and the democratic world are strong protectors of Spanish democracy and supporters of Spain's future liberation, while American imperialism is openly supporting Franco. Last October, the Political Bureau of the Spanish Communist Party declared: "The Spanish people will never fight against the Soviet Union," and called on Spanish patriots to wage a strong struggle against Franco under the command of U.S. imperialism. Since the publication of this statement, the Communist Party in Spain has strengthened its work activities under this instruction.
    Today, as the fascists supported by U.S. imperialism and its European lackeys are launching a frantic attack on Spanish democracy, its heroic vanguard, the Communist Party, is uniting the vast Spanish people to organize anti-Franco organizations, oppose the instigators of a new war, and struggle for Spain's freedom and independence. The democrats of Spain believe that the working class and progressive organizations of Europe and the Americas will, following the example of the Soviet Union and the new democracies, loudly protest the policies of those governments that incite Franco's terrorist crimes.

    英勇奋战的西班牙人民
    西共政治局委员  费尔南多·克劳丁
    （续完）
    一九四八年十二月二十日的英国“泰晤士报”刊载了一篇西班牙通讯说：在每一个地方都可以听到批评，同时都是很公开的。一九四八年十二月十日“纽约时报”发表了一封西班牙访问者的来信，他写道：这个国家已尖锐的分化为一端是极端右派们的少数，另端是极端左派的绝大多数。
    在这种情形下，共产党地下组织巩固地团结着某周围群众。不顾残酷压迫，共产党日益密切了与人民的联系。为了推翻佛朗哥统治机构，西共正尽力地提高工人阶级和全人民的政治觉悟，团结并组织人民的所有的力量。
    最近几个星期来，佛朗哥政府利用马德里至巴塞罗纳列车被毁作为加紧恐怖镇压的借口。二月十四日，报纸和电台同时发表声明，妄指共产党应负这个破坏的责任。
    在散布了这个荒谬的谣言以后，反动报纸和电台立刻开始了“需要残忍的逮捕和摧毁所有敌人的机构”的宣传，当然，特别是要对付共产党。这样，在它们所制造的恶意宣传以后，四个月以前被判为死刑的四位英勇的共产党员——卡利罗、瓦尔维尔德、普格德蒙特和米斯特里在巴塞罗纳被枪杀了。
    在奥堪亚狱里，著名的工会领袖约塞、撒都艾，仅经过了一次仓促的审讯就判处了死刑。在塞维里，被控为在安达拉西阿重组共产党而判处死刑的英勇战士马立奥和罗披斯·凯斯特勒亦在严重危险之中。在撒拉高斯，刽子手们正计划谋杀曾被控告在阿拉贡重组共产党的爱米里欧·毕斯杜耶拉。在毕立波欧，沙杜路尼欧·劳披斯和其他反法西斯者已被判处死刑。在马德里，三位反法西斯者不久前为军事法庭判处死刑。全国各处，凡被认为“嫌疑犯”们的家庭正遭受搜捕与抢劫。在狱里，出名的共产党员和反法西斯者被挑出来受军事法庭审讯。
    除非世界民主力量立刻行动起来营救这些英勇不屈的战士，否则，他们即将被谋杀。
    西班牙的共和党和工人的政党曾致电联合国，要求阻止佛朗哥政权这种野蛮的恐怖，营救那些被囚在狱里的战士们的生命。签署在电报上的有共和联盟（主席马丁纳斯·巴尔里奥斯，流亡在外）、左翼共和党（主席为流亡在外的共和政府总理，阿尔保诺斯）、堪塔隆尼亚左翼共和党、共和联合党、西班牙社会主义工人党（与波里埃图所领导的右翼投机分子相反的）、全国工人联盟、堪塔隆尼亚联合社会主义党和西班牙共产党。
    他们的呼声代表着西班牙国内绝大多数的民主力量的意志，并为争取和平与民主与反对新战争挑拨者的民主力量一致热烈支持。
    在西班牙佛朗哥镇压民主运动的新恐怖浪潮是与帝国主义集团欲使西班牙成为战略的、军事的和政治的基地有着密切的关系。美国需要佛朗哥把西班牙“改头换面”一下，借此使佛朗哥政府有公开参加地中海和大西洋公约甚至成为联合国的会员的可能。为达此一目的，他们正计划利用甘为帝国主义和西班牙反动派服役的右翼社会党和安那其主义的领袖们合作，以恢复皇室统治保存独裁的力量。
    把西班牙公开的拉入美国“卫星”轨道的这种政治力量准备的同时，军事活动也在迅速的进行着。在美国参谋部所派遣的军事代表团监督之下，根据很久以前的美国协议，正在建设机场，重建军港，开辟军事公路，在比利牛斯山增筑炮台和开采铀矿。佛朗哥政府不仅把西班牙出卖给华尔街作军事基地与战略资源，而且，也献出了百万士兵作为反苏战争的炮灰；但是，广大人民对这些出卖行为的愤怒态度，使佛朗哥反动集团大大地感到恐慌。
    西班牙的人民一天比一天看得更清楚：苏联与民主世界是西班牙民主的强有力的保护者，是西班牙未来解放的支持者，而美帝国主义却公开的扶植佛朗哥。去年十月，西班牙共产党政治局声明说：“西班牙人民决不对苏联作战”，声明并号召西班牙爱国人士对美帝指挥下的佛朗哥作坚强的斗争。自发表此声明后，西班牙各地共产党即在这个指示下增强了工作活动。
    在今天，当美帝国主义及其欧洲奴仆们所支持的法西斯对西班牙民主疯狂进攻时，她的英勇先锋队共产党联合着西班牙广大的人民组织起反佛朗哥机构、反对新战争挑拨者和为争取西班牙自由与独立的斗争的行列。西班牙的民主人士们相信，欧洲和美洲的工人阶级与进步组织将随着苏联与新民主主义国家的榜样，高声抗议那些政府唆使佛朗哥恐怖罪行的政策。（孙兢译自四月一日“为争取持久和平与人民民主”）
