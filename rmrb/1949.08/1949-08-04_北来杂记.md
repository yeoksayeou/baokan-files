Miscellaneous Notes from the North
    Chong Shu

    When I left Shanghai, Nanjing had just been liberated, and the reactionaries in Shanghai were in a state of chaotic frenzy. The puppet officials were busy carrying gold bars and their wives and concubines, scattering like chickens and dogs. Secret agents were intensifying their killings and extortions, openly implementing a policy of terror. I remember one day on Avenue Joffre in Shanghai, a student was hit by a jeep and injured. He said angrily, "Wait till the Eighth Route Army comes and see if you'll still be so rampant!" Unfortunately, a plainclothes policeman heard him, and he "disappeared" that night. Such situations were everywhere. The cruel law of "those who engage in private discussions shall be executed in the marketplace," established by Qin Shi Huang, was being concocted with extra ingredients by his filial descendants, the Chiang Kai-shek and Tang Enbo bandit gangs, thousands of years later. It is said that the war criminal Tang Enbo openly extorted money from the Shanghai business community, demanding 20,000 gold bars, otherwise he would completely destroy all the factories. However, due to the rapid advance of the People's Liberation Army and the factory protection movement of patriotic workers, the war criminals' vicious schemes were not implemented and they fled in a panic.

    Under the threat of terror, I was forced to leave Shanghai at the end of April, going to Hong Kong via Guangzhou. At that time, Chiang's little clique was proclaiming that it had moved from Nanjing to Guangzhou. But when you asked the locals on the street, "Where is the National Government?" no one knew. Perhaps when you passed the door of a store, company, or residence, you might happen to see a sign, something like a ministry "office," and when you went inside, there were only two or three hungry-looking minor officials, listlessly "watching the pile." The "ministers" and "directors" had long since absconded with public funds to become "rentiers" in Hong Kong, Taiwan, or even foreign countries. After arriving in Hong Kong, I read a newspaper report of a statement by a British Foreign Office spokesman, saying, "Our ambassador to China is currently facing many difficulties in moving with the National Government, because it is not known exactly where it is now. Some say it is in Guangzhou, some say it is still in Shanghai, and it seems it will move to Taiwan. And the whereabouts of the president and vice president are also unknown. Therefore, it is impossible to move." Such a chaotic situation can be imagined.

    Economically, people who have lived in Beiping and Tianjin still remember the words "Gold Yuan Note," right? It was probably the most successful and profitable business that Chiang Kai-shek ever did, from being a clerk in a stock brokerage to becoming a national thief. At that time, how many naive and kind ordinary people had their meager savings of gold and silver, accumulated over the years with their blood and sweat, seized from them at 200 yuan per tael. How many manufacturers were forced to close down or even brutally killed because they were dissatisfied with this method. I remember when the scam was just beginning, he declared that the largest denomination would be 100 yuan; but after only half a year, when the writer left Guangzhou, banknotes with a face value of one million yuan were already being issued. The people openly refused to use them. In Shanghai, silver dollars and US dollars had become the recognized currency at that time. In Guangzhou, it was completely the world of Hong Kong dollars. "Gold Yuan Notes" were at most used as subsidiary currency for making change. When in Guangzhou, a pot of tea in a small tea house cost one million yuan in puppet currency. A pancake cost five hundred thousand yuan. This would probably be astonishing to people who have long been away from the threat of inflation! But you must not forget that prices in the Kuomintang-controlled areas rose every three or four hours, and today, a month later, they have probably already caught up with astronomical figures.

    When I was in the Kuomintang-controlled area, every time I eavesdropped on Communist broadcasts, when I heard that the people in a certain place were eagerly looking forward to the People's Liberation Army, I always harbored a certain amount of skepticism, thinking that there was some propaganda effect in it. After arriving in Guangzhou and staying in a hotel, when the clerk heard that the guest was from the North, they immediately surrounded me and asked questions with great concern. "When did you come out? Is your hometown doing well? You're not suffering this anymore! You've made it through!" This feeling of longing for liberation answered my past doubts.

    ※ ※ ※

    I arrived in Hong Kong in early May. The second day after arriving in Hong Kong, it happened to be the day when one of the British Empire's warships wounded in the battle of the Yangtze River (it seemed to be the "Consort") sailed into Hong Kong. At that time, the pier was full of people watching the ship, riddled with holes by the People's Liberation Army, dejectedly entering the port. We excitedly forgot that our feet were still on the colonial soil of Hong Kong and couldn't help but applaud, arousing the anger of the British soldiers on both sides, but they could only helplessly roll their eyes. Unexpectedly, the British expatriates in Hong Kong also showed an unusually cold attitude towards this incident. Therefore, a London imperial news agency later reported: "Because our wounded warship did not receive the comfort and enthusiasm of the local people after arriving in Hong Kong, it can be seen that most of the British expatriates in Hong Kong have forgotten their motherland," and so on.

   ※ ※ ※

    On May 14th, I boarded the Hubei Wheel and left Hong Kong. After ten days at sea, I set foot on the territory of New China on the evening of the 24th. As the ship slowly entered the dock, facing this vast wilderness, rows of towering chimneys, seeing them and ourselves all returning to the new world we had longed for for several years, many passengers couldn't help but shed tears of excitement...

    北来杂记
    崇枢
    当我离开上海的时候，南京方才解放，上海的反动派正如乌鸦噪窝的局面。伪官们正在忙着携带金条妻妾，鸡飞狗走。特务们正在加强屠害、勒索，公开推行恐怖政策。记得有一天在上海霞飞路一个学生，因为脚踏车被一辆吉普撞伤，愤恨地说了一句：“等八路来了看你们还这样横行不！”不幸被便衣警察听到了，于是当晚就“失踪”了。这种情形，到处都是。秦始皇所定的“偶语者弃市”的酷法，在数千年后的今天，被他的孝子贤孙蒋介石汤恩伯匪帮们来加料泡制了。据说当时战犯汤恩伯公开向上海工商界勒索，开价两万条黄金，否则将全部厂家彻底破坏。可是由于解放军的进展神速，以及爱国工人的护厂运动，使战犯们的狠毒手段，未得施展出来即狼狈而逃了。
    ※          ※          ※  
    在恐怖的威胁下，我被迫于四月底离开上海，经广州去香港。当时的蒋记小班，正宣称已经由南京迁到广州。可是你到街上问当地人：“国民政府”在哪里，就没有人能知道。也许当你走过一家商店、公司或住宅的门口时，碰巧可以看到一块招牌，什么部“办公处”之类，走进去一看，里面只有两三个面带饥饿的小公务员，在那里无精打采地“看着堆儿”，“部长”“司长”等早已挟着公款去香港、台湾以至于外国坐“寓公”去了。到香港后，有一天看报纸记载一篇英国外交部发言人的谈话说：“我们驻华大使目前随国民政府迁移困难甚多，因为不知道它现在确在何处。一说在广州，一说仍在上海，又似将迁往台湾。而该总统及副总统究在何处，亦均不得而知。故无法迁移。”这种混乱的情形，可以想见了。
    ※          ※          ※  
    经济方面，久居平津的人还记得“金元券”三个字吧？它大概是蒋介石从在股票行当伙计起，以至到窃国大盗止，最得意，最发财的一批买卖了。当时有多少天真善良的老百姓，手中仅有的历年血汗积存的少数金银，被他二百元一两的括攫而去。有多少厂商因为不满意他这种手段，而被迫封闭以至于惨杀。记得骗局才开幕的时候，那时他宣称，最大票面一百元；可是半年的光景，当笔者离穗时，已经发用一百万元一张的纸币了。人民对于它的使用，全公开拒绝。在上海银元、美钞，当时已成公认通货。在广州就完全是港币的世界了。“金元券”充其量不过用作辅币找零而已。当在广州的时候，在小茶馆喝一壶清茶，伪钞一百万元。烧饼一个五十万元。这大概在久已离开通货膨胀威胁下的老百姓们，要觉得惊异吧！但是你不要忘记国统区的物价是每三四小时涨一次，在一个月后的今天，恐怕早追上天文数字了。
    ※          ※          ※  
    当我身居国统区的时候，每次窃听中共广播，当一听到某某地方的老百姓，正在急切盼望解放军的时候，心中总抱有一种怀疑的成份，认为其中多少有一种宣传的作用在里面。到广州后，宿在一家旅店中，当店员听出来客是北方口音的时候，即纷纷包围着，很关心的问长问短，“你们什么时候出来的呀？你们老家可好过了呀！不受这个罪了！熬出来了！”这种渴望着解放的心情，给我解答了过去的怀疑。

    五月初到香港。到港第二日正巧是英帝国在长江作战负伤舰队中的一艘（好象是“干诺号”）开到香港。当时码头上站满了人看着这被解放军打得千疮百孔的船，垂头丧气地开入港口。我们兴奋地忘掉自己的脚尚踏在殖民地的港土上，情不自禁的鼓起掌来，引起两旁英国士兵的愤怒，然而也只能无可奈何的白了两眼。意外的是在港的英侨，对于这次事件的表现，也是异常冷淡。所以后来伦敦一家帝国通讯社报导说：“由于这次我们负伤军舰开到香港后，并没得到当地人民的慰问与热情，可以看到在港英侨已经大半忘掉了祖国”云云。

    五月十四日搭湖北轮离港，十天的海程，二十四日傍晚踏上了新中国的领土。当轮船正徐徐的驶入码头，我们面对着这广大的原野，一排排林立的烟囱，看它们和自己全归到数年来所向往的新天地时，不期而然的许多旅客全兴奋的流下热泪来……。
