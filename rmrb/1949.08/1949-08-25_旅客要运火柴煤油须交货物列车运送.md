To the Editor:

    Our cooperative exclusively supplies daily necessities to its members. Kerosene, matches, and other items are needed here, but they must be purchased from Beiping. We purchased a batch in May, which was transported by train and has now been sold out. This month, we purchased three boxes of matches from Beiping, but the staff at the Beiping Railway Station wouldn't let the goods onto the train. We don't understand why. We hope for a response!

    Shacheng Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Huailai County
    Shacheng Cooperative, Huailai County:

    Regarding the question you raised, the Ministry of Railways has responded as follows:

    Editor

    Concerning the transportation of kerosene and matches, according to the Ministry's regulations regarding the restrictions on items carried by passengers in the passenger and luggage transport rules, each passenger can carry no more than fifty small boxes of matches. Kerosene is generally not allowed in passenger cars. At the same time, to ensure the safety of passengers, all dangerous goods and items that may pose a hazard to others are not allowed to be transported by passenger trains. The kerosene, matches, and other items purchased by your cooperative are all classified as dangerous goods, and it would be inappropriate to transport them by passenger cars. Therefore, these items can be transported by freight train. Please go to Beiping West Station to complete the consignment procedures. There will be no refusal.

    Ministry of Railways of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission

　　旅客要运火柴煤油须交货物列车运送编辑先生：
    敝社专供应社员日用必需品。此地需用煤油、火柴等物，但该项物品必须从北平买来。五月间曾购买一批，由火车运来，现已销完。本月又至平购火柴三箱，但北平车站人员不让货物上车，不知什么意思，希答复！
　　怀来县沙城供销社怀来县沙城合作社：
    你们所提的问题，经铁道部答复如下：
    编者
    所提运送火油及火柴一节，按本部规定的旅客及行李包裹运送规则内旅客随身携带物品限制中，火柴每人可携带五十小盒以内，火油基本是不准带入客车。同时为了保障旅客之安全，对凡属于危险品及有危害波及其他之虞的物品，皆不准以旅客列车运送。而你社所采购之煤油火柴等，皆属于危险品类，如以客车输送，实欠妥当。因此对上项物品，可由货物列车运送，请赴北平西站办理托运手续，绝不会拒绝的。
