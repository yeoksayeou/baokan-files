　　Encouraging Private Merchants to Purchase Rice in Production Areas
  　Shanghai Grain Prices Steadily Decline
    [Report from this newspaper] Shanghai News: Recently, prices have stabilized, and the grain market has experienced minimal fluctuations. The Shanghai Municipal Trade Corporation, responsible for supplying food to the entire Shanghai population, has developed detailed plans. In addition to actively contacting trade companies in various production areas to exchange industrial goods for food, ensuring long-term stability in the grain market, frequent victories on the front lines and the expansion of liberated areas are leading to a steady flow of rice from the granaries of Hubei and Hunan, as well as new rice from Jiangxi, ensuring a secure source of rice for Shanghai. The Trade Corporation is also encouraging private merchants to freely purchase grain in various rice-producing areas, strictly implementing the policy of free domestic trade as announced by the East China Military Region on the 17th of this month. Past practices of restricting the flow of goods, such as procurement permits and travel permits, which caused difficulties and blockages, have been strictly corrected or abolished. Grain merchants in the city have sent personnel to freely purchase grain in production areas and distribution centers, with their footprints reaching Bengbu, Wuhu, Wuxi, and other places. The market price of medium white粳 rice in Shanghai on the 24th was 37,000 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure, approx. 100 liters), a decrease of 4,000 yuan compared to the 41,000 yuan on the 18th, and a daily decrease of 1,000 yuan compared to the previous day (22nd). Prices in the production areas are still much lower. For example, in Bengbu on the 18th, the price was only 16,500 yuan per shi, in Nanjing it was only 24,000 yuan, in Wuhu it was as low as 18,500 yuan, and high-quality white粳 rice in Wuxi was only 35,700 yuan at that time. "Soldier Ship" flour on the 18th was 7,300 yuan per bag, but by yesterday (24th) it had fallen to 6,400 yuan, a decrease of 900 yuan. Therefore, Shanghai grain prices are much higher than in the production areas, making it profitable for grain merchants to purchase grain. Currently, transportation is convenient. In addition to the 20,000 tons of rice from the Northeast and a large quantity of Jiangxi rice being shipped to Shanghai, a large quantity of grain purchased by Shanghai merchants from various places is also being transported here. The grain market price in Shanghai is stable, and the future looks optimistic.

　　鼓励私商赴产地购米
  　沪市粮价稳落
    【本报讯】上海消息：最近物价稳定，食粮市况极少波动。上海市贸易总公司负责供应整个沪市民食，已有详尽计划，除积极向各产地贸易公司接洽，以城市工业品交换食粮，俾长期稳定粮食市况；且前线捷讯频传，解放区扩大，两湖米仓及江西新米，源源运沪，食米来源，保证无虞。贸总并鼓励私商前往产米区各地自由采购，按华东军区于本月十七日布告严格执行对内贸易自由政策，过去沿用限制物资流通之办法，如采购证、通行证等留难禁阻情形，经严格纠正或废除，本市粮商纷纷派专人至产区或集散地自由采购，足迹遍及蚌埠、芜湖、无锡各地。本市中白粳市价，二十四日每石三万七千元，较之十八日四万一千元已落四千元之多，较前（二十二日）日落一千元。而产地价格尚远较此为低。如蚌埠十八日每石仅一万六千五百元，南京也只二万四千元，芜湖低至一万八千五百元，无锡上白粳当时也才三万五千七百元，兵船粉十八日每袋七千三百元，至昨（二十四日）已落至六千四百元，下落九百元之多。故沪市粮价远高于产地，粮商采购有利可图，目前运输便利，除东北支援本市之二万吨大米和大批赣米运来外，再加本市商人采购之各地大批食米运来，本市粮食市价平稳，前途更可乐观。
