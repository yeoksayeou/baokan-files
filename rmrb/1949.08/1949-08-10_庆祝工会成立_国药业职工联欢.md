    Celebrating the Establishment of the Trade Union
    National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Get-Together
    [This Dispatch] Yesterday (9th), workers in the national pharmaceutical industry in Beiping held a get-together to celebrate the establishment of their trade union. Zhang Chunjiu, director of the preparatory committee for shop assistants' work of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, attended and participated, along with more than 200 representatives from the oil and salt, grain, rickshaw, sanitation, footwear, and carpet and wool weaving industries. At the meeting, Wang Jinzhang, director of the National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union, reported on the significance of the meeting, giving a general account of the process by which the workers in the national pharmaceutical industry organized themselves and the circumstances under which the collective labor-management contract was concluded. Wang Jinzhang emphasized that the conclusion of the collective labor-management contract in the national pharmaceutical industry set a precedent for the rational resolution of labor-management issues in Tianjin, and even the whole country, which is well worth celebrating. After the executive committee members of the trade union took their oath of office, the trade union representatives read and explained the collective contract of the national pharmaceutical industry. Following this, Wang Jinzhang explained in detail to the meeting the work that the National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union had resolved to promote in August, which included improving the grassroots organizations of the trade union; each store should, according to its circumstances, and without violating the spirit of the collective contract, separately sign more specific simple contracts or agreements to determine wages based on the degree of labor, ability, level of responsibility, and quality of performance, and other issues. Afterwards, worker representatives and guests spoke one after another, expressing their welcome for the conclusion of the collective contract. Zhao Junjie, a worker from Tongrentang in his sixties, sang a song at the meeting to replace what he wanted to say. The workers also performed acrobatics and plays to add to the fun. (Li)
