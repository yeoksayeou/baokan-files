People's Bank of China, Shijiazhuang Branch
  Supports Private Industry and Commerce
  Loans of over 40 million in June and July
  [Shijiazhuang Electric] The People's Bank of China, Shijiazhuang Branch, issued loans totaling over 40 million yuan in June and July to support private industry and commerce. The loan methods are divided into two types: real value loans and credit loans, of which credit loans account for the vast majority. In order to improve the equipment of the cotton weaving industry and improve the quality of production, the bank gave special consideration to loans to the cotton weaving industry. For example, cotton weaving factories such as Yushengxiang, Huagan San, and Dasheng obtained loans and purchased new-style textile machines; Xinhua, Chengcheng and other textile factories also installed electric motors. In addition, 90% of the iron factories in the city have received loans. The cotton weaving and iron industries account for the largest proportion of Shijiazhuang's industry, and are the focus of industrial development in the resolutions of the city's People's Congress. Therefore, the bank's loans have played a significant role in supporting Shijiazhuang's industrial development. Other private industries that have borrowed from the bank include soap, caustic soda, printing, brick kilns, oil pressing, and cotton ginning. In order to implement the policy of supporting production, the bank is vigorously promoting the loan business, in the hope that all private industries in the city that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood can get help from loans.

　　人民银行石家庄分行
  　扶植私营工商业
  　六七月份贷款四千余万
    【石家庄电】人民银行石家庄分行六、七两月为扶植私营工商业计发放贷款四千余万元。贷款方式分折实贷款与信用贷款两种，其中信用贷款占绝大多数。为改善棉织业设备，提高生产品质量，故该行在对棉织业贷款中特别予以照顾，如裕生祥、化干三、大生等棉织厂获得贷款及购置了新式纺织机；新华、成城等纺织厂亦装置了电动机。还有全市百分之九十的铁工厂均获得了贷款。棉织、铁工两业，在石市工业中所占比例最大，而且是该市人民代表大会决议中发展工业的重点，因此该分行的贷款对石市工业扶植上起了很大作用。其他各种私营工业向该行贷款的还有肥皂、火碱、印刷、砖窑、榨油、轧花等业。现该行为贯彻扶植生产方针，正大力推广贷款业务，以期全市有益国计民生的私营工业都能得到贷款的帮助。
