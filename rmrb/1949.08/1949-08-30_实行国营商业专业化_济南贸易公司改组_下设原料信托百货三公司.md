Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 29th - The Jinan City Trading Company has been reorganized, establishing three separate companies under it: Industrial Raw Materials, Trust, and Department Store. The Industrial Raw Materials Company is tasked with coordinating the procurement and supply of raw materials based on the needs of various industrial sectors. Adhering to the principle of "public first, private second," it will support private industries beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood through methods such as entrusted processing and exchange of finished products. The Trust Company engages in various agency purchase and sale and agency management businesses, facilitating the buying and selling for farmers and foreign merchants, shielding them from the manipulation of speculative merchants, and promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. The Department Store Company sells various civilian industrial products, solving the sales channels for civilian industrial products while also supplying the daily necessities of urban and rural people in conjunction with consumer cooperatives. In the past, state-owned industries in Jinan purchased their own raw materials, and many industries often felt raw material shortages. Moreover, the blind scramble for raw materials by various factories stimulated price increases, which not only increased the cost of industrial products but also affected the entire market. The sales of finished products from both public and private industries and the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas were also deeply affected by the manipulation of certain speculators. After the establishment of the above three companies, state-owned commerce will be able to play a promoting role in the restoration and development of production.

　　实行国营商业专业化
    济南贸易公司改组
  　下设原料信托百货三公司
    【新华社济南二十九日电】济南市贸易公司已于该公司下分别设立了工业原料、信托、百货三个公司。工业原料公司的任务是根据各工业部门的需要来统筹原料的采购和供应，在先公后私的原则下，将以委托加工、交换成品等方式，扶植有利于国计民生的私营工业。信托公司经营各种代购代销、代理经营的业务，便利农民和外来客商的购销，使其免受投资奸商的操纵，以促进城乡的物资交流。百货公司则经售各种民用工业品，一面解决民用工业品的销路，一面结合消费合作社供应城乡人民生活日用品。过去济市公营工业自购原料，许多工业常感原料困难，且因各厂盲目地抢购原料，刺激物价上涨，不仅增加了工业品的成本，也影响了整个市场。公私工业的成品推销和城乡物资交流，亦因某些投机商人的操纵，而深受影响。上述三公司成立后，国营商业对恢复和发展生产将可发挥推动作用。
