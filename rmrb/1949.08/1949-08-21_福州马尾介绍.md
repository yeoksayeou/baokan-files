Introduction to Mawei, Fuzhou

　　Fuzhou City, also known as Rongcheng or Minhou, is the capital of Fujian Province and the political, economic, and cultural center of the province, as well as one of the province's cotton textile centers. The city has a population of approximately 400,000, with over 50,000 workers. Handicraft industry is relatively developed, producing lacquerware, carvings, leather, etc. However, due to long-term oppression and encroachment by imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the city's factories have almost all collapsed. There are seven institutions of higher learning in the city, including Union University and Hua Nan Women's University, and more than 20 secondary schools, with a total of over 30,000 students in secondary schools and above. In the spring of the year before last, Fuzhou students held a large-scale demonstration of more than 20,000 people against hunger and against the American imperialists' support for Japan.

　　Fuzhou City is located south of the Min River and faces Taiwan across the sea, only 128 nautical miles from Danshui Port in Taiwan. After the liberation of Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, Fuzhou became the largest stronghold of the remaining Kuomintang bandit gangs in the southeast. At the end of July, the Kuomintang bandit gangs formed the "Southeast Military and Political Chief Executive Office," attempting to establish a so-called "mainland defense line" along the southeast coast to shield their bandit nest in Taiwan. The liberation of Fuzhou completely shattered the Kuomintang bandit gangs' illusion of establishing this "defense line."

　　Mawei is located on the north bank of the Min River, forty miles southeast of Fuzhou, and is China's earliest naval base. The area has a shipyard and naval academy, etc., and before liberation, it was one of the important bases of the remaining Kuomintang bandit gangs' navy. About sixty miles to its east is the Changmen Fort, which guards the exit of the Min River and is extremely strategic. [Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 20th]

　　福州马尾介绍
    福州市为福建省会，又称榕城、闽侯，为全省政治、经济、文化中心，并为全省棉织业中心之一。全市人口约四十万，有工人五万余人，手工业较发达，盛产漆器、雕刻、皮革等。但由于久受帝国主义与国民党反动派的压榨侵吞，全市工厂倒闭殆尽。市内专科以上的学校有协和大学、华南女大等七校，中等学校二十余所，中等学校以上学生共三万多人。前年春，福州学生曾举行两万多人的反饥饿，反美帝扶日的大游行。
    福州市区南临闽江，与台湾隔海相望，相距台湾之淡水港仅一百二十八海里。京沪杭解放后，福州即成为国民党匪帮残余在东南的最大据点。七月底国民党匪帮曾组成“东南军政长官公署”，企图在东南沿海建立所谓“大陆防线”，以掩护匪巢台湾。福州解放后，就完全打破了国民党匪帮建立这一“防线”的幻想。
    马尾在福州东南四十里的闽江北岸，为我国最早的海军根据地。该地有船厂，及海军学校等，解放前为国民党匪帮残余海军重要基地之一。其东约六十里，有长门炮台，扼闽江出口，极为险要。【新华社福建前线二十日电】
