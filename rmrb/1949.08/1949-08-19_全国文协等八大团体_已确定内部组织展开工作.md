    [Reported by this newspaper] The National Federation of Literary and Art Circles has been established for nearly a month, and various tasks are now gradually unfolding. The internal organizations of eight groups under the unified leadership of the Federation, including the National Literary Association, Film Association, Drama Association, Music Association, Fine Arts Association, Dance Association, and the Preparatory Committee for the Chinese Opera Improvement Association, and the Preparatory Committee for the Quyi Improvement Association, have all been determined, and specific tasks to be carried out have been planned separately.
    The organization of the National Literary Association is divided into four departments: Research, Creation, Editing and Publishing, and Organization, and a Literary Advisory Committee. Currently, it is preparing to edit and publish the "People's Literature" monthly journal of approximately 150,000 words on October 1st, introducing literary works and literary work experience from all over the country. In addition, the Creation Department, including Hu Qi, Bai Ai, Zhao Fucheng, and Hu Danfei, is collectively creating the play "Crossing the Yangtze River".
    The internal organization of the National Film Association is divided into four departments: Editing, Research, Information, and Liaison, as well as a Secretariat. Recently, it is jointly planning with the Central Film Bureau to publish a publication to guide national film work. At the same time, it plans to assist in organizing the establishment of trade unions for film workers throughout the country (because film is also a state enterprise, which is different in nature from other associations). The Northeast Film Workers Union has been established, and Shanghai is in the process of nominating candidates by the Film and Drama Association to prepare for the establishment of a Shanghai Film Association branch. In addition, the National Film Association is planning to establish a club dedicated to the cultural entertainment and creative research of film workers.
    The National Drama Association is currently preparing for the publication of "People's Drama". The establishment of local branches has also begun, and in conjunction with the Opera Improvement Preparatory Committee, it is planning to prepare for the establishment of a larger drama museum in Beiping. The internal organization of the Drama Association, in addition to the Secretariat, is divided into five departments: Research, Drama Movement, Editing and Publishing, Organization and Liaison, and Welfare, as well as two committees: Script Creation and Drama Education.
    The National Music Association, in addition to preparing for the establishment of local branches, will publish the "People's Music" monthly journal edited and published by the Music Association in Beiping at the end of September. At the same time, they are strengthening ties with music educators to promote music education. The Music Association is now divided into four departments: Research, Organization, Editing and Publishing, and Welfare.
    The organization of the National Fine Arts Association is divided into a Guidance Department, an Editing and Publishing Department, a Welfare Department, an Exhibition Department, and a Secretariat. They are also preparing for the editing and publishing of "People's Fine Arts". At the same time, they have sorted out all the artworks from the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers exhibition, and yesterday (the 18th), comrades such as Mo Pu from China University took them to Shanghai for exhibition.
    In addition to carrying out the establishment of various branches, the National Dance Association will also prepare to publish the "People's Dance" publication. In addition, the Dance Association's Sports Department has established contact with the Beiping Municipal Education Bureau and various school folk dance clubs to carry out the popularization of folk dance. The organization of the Dance Association is divided into four departments: Research, Organization and Liaison, Performance and Publication, and Sports.
    The organization of the Preparatory Committee of the National Quyi Improvement Association is divided into five departments: Editing and Publishing, Collection and Research, Guidance, Organization and Liaison, and Welfare. In addition to carrying out the entire publication work of "People's Quyi" and "New Quyi Series", it is also jointly preparing with the Literary and Art Section of the Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station to start broadcasting new Quyi programs on September 1st. In addition, it plans to exchange views on reforming old artists in various places and launch the formation of Quyi reform organizations in various places.
    After the establishment of the preparatory meeting of sponsors of the Chinese Opera Improvement Association, it has been divided into four departments: Research, Review, Welfare, and Information to carry out work. Currently, it is preparing to organize a creative organization dedicated to selecting themes and writing new scripts. As for the work of sorting out and adapting old scripts, it will also be carried out at the same time, planning to sort out everything from Yuan Dynasty dramas and Ming Dynasty legends to the current old dramas, and study the historical parts. In addition, work on the establishment of branches throughout the country will also begin.

    全国美协的组织分为指导部、编辑出版部、福利部、展览部和秘书处。他们也正在筹备“人民美术”的编辑出版工作，同时最近他们将全国文代大会展览的全部艺术作品整理好，已于昨天（十八日）由华大莫朴等同志携带到上海去展览。

    中国戏曲改进会发起人筹备会成立后，已分为研究、编审、福利、资料等四部进行工作。目前正准备组织一个创作机构，专门挑选题材、编写新剧本。至于整理改编旧剧本工作，亦将同时进行，拟自元曲、明代的传奇一直到现在的旧剧都加以整理，并研究史的部分。此外关于全国各地分会成立的工作也将开始。
