The twelve representatives elected by the Preparatory Committee of Peiping Universities and Colleges to attend the Peiping Conference of Representatives from All Walks of Life were He Shushuang, Luo Changpei, Qian Duansheng, Yang Guizhen, Fei Xiaotong, Hu Yuanling, Yan Jici, Zhao Chengxin, Weng Dujian, Xu Beihong, Zhao Lian, and Wang Bin. After the meeting, they expressed their thoughts as follows:

　　The reports on the work of the Peiping Military Control Commission and the municipal government, the instructions from the leaders attending the meeting, the speeches of the leaders of various parties, and Comrade Peng Zhen's summary of the meeting have been published in detail in the newspapers. We do not wish to repeat them here. We only want to reflect on some of our impressions of this meeting.

　　First, what we heard first at the meeting were the work reports of the various departments of the Military Control Commission and the municipal government over the past six months. This work has been progressing steadily according to plan, coming from the masses and going to the masses. However, before these reports, these plans of the Military Control Commission and the municipal government were not publicly announced with great fanfare. It is not that they had no plans, but that they preferred to act first and then speak, rather than speak without acting; they preferred to cash their checks fully rather than overdraw them, and especially not to issue empty checks. Looking back at the period of the Kuomintang reactionaries' rule, what was it like? Every time there was a festival or anniversary, there were always grand official telegrams published, and every change of a high-ranking official in an agency always brought grandiose plans, but the result was "saying all the good words and doing all the bad deeds"; there were only plans, no work; only budgets, no reimbursements. On this point alone, the people's regime under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party has indeed put into practice the ancient saying: "Governing does not require much talking, but only diligent practice." This is absolutely something the Kuomintang reactionaries could not catch up with.

　　Second, at this meeting, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Vice-Chairman Zhou, and Chairman Dong all issued calls for developing production; the representatives' proposals also included twelve that advocated developing production. The twelve of us also put forward a proposal, "Please encourage school and government personnel to participate in production," which was adopted by the conference and submitted to relevant agencies and organizations for consultation and implementation. The mood at the meeting was almost unanimous in responding to this call, striving to turn the consuming Peiping into a producing Peiping, so as to make this new capital of the People's Democratic United Government a model for major cities across the country. Commander-in-Chief Zhu particularly solemnly pointed out in his speech: "In the past, people regarded not engaging in production as noble, but now public servants and teachers must also engage in production." This can indeed cause us, these educational and cultural workers, to reflect deeply. The purpose of our proposal coincides with Commander-in-Chief Zhu's call. We earnestly hope that intellectuals can implement the spirit of "doing it yourself" and "self-reliance," following the good example of Yan'an's implementation of streamlining and frugality from 1939 to 1942, which resulted in abundant food and clothing, and strive to participate in production to reduce the burden on the people.

　　Third, at 5:20 pm on August 13th, Chairman Mao personally came to the meeting to give instructions to the representatives, hoping that the current Conference of Representatives from All Walks of Life could exercise the functions of the Peiping Municipal People's Congress and establish the city's highest people's power as soon as conditions are ripe. Finally, he took out a letter from a citizen and handed it over to the conference for discussion. He solemnly requested that the representatives be able to answer the questions of this citizen and all the citizens of Peiping. After Chairman Mao left the meeting, a heated discussion immediately began. Finally, Comrade Peng Zhen gave a summary, pointing out that we are now in a very difficult period. However, this difficulty is a difficulty in victory, a difficulty in progress. To overcome this difficulty, the first thing is to work hard to support the front and eliminate the remaining reactionary forces; the second is to develop production; and the third is to strictly manage finance. The people of Peiping and even the people of the whole country must grit their teeth and overcome this difficulty. … Speaking of "working hard to support the front," we, these educational and cultural workers, must deeply understand that there are still more than four million armed comrades on the front lines fighting to eliminate the remaining reactionary forces and liberate all of China. Each of them needs 333 catties of millet per month. On average, fifty farmers can support one soldier. In the past, 11.75 million farmers have supported the three-year Liberation War, and now we must continue to rely on them. They not only support the front lines, but also supply us. According to the current salary standards, 150 farmers can support a professor, 80 farmers can support a teaching assistant, and 40 farmers can support a staff member. Therefore, we must strictly implement frugality to support the front, only then can we be worthy of the farmers, and only then can we be worthy of the four million heroic soldiers on the front lines!

　　Fourth, Vice-Chairman Zhou specifically pointed out in his report "Carry the Revolution Through to the End and Build a New China": "What we rely on to build a new China is the people's democratic dictatorship established by the people's democratic united front. Now we must not only expand this front, but also maintain its consolidation, and demand internal cooperation and criticism." This Peiping Conference of Representatives from All Walks of Life is a great success of the people's democratic united front under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Its main goal is to "unite four friends, eliminate three enemies, and complete two major tasks." This partial great unity has laid the foundation for national unity. The representatives' classes range from workers, peasants, and petty bourgeoisie to national capitalists; the representatives' ages range from eighty-odd years old to fifteen years old; such a great unity of people from all walks of life is truly an unprecedented event! During the meeting, everyone debated enthusiastically, pursuing the truth by saying everything they knew and saying it without reservation; yet, at all times and in all places, they were harmoniously and happily united like a family. What especially excites us intellectuals is the strength of the worker and peasant representatives, the sincerity of their feelings, and the firmness of their will, which truly make us brain workers pale in comparison. Therefore, brain workers should always learn from manual workers, so that they will not hesitate and waver, and become Li Xin in *The Red Maid* or supporters of the so-called "democratic individualism" in the Acheson White Paper! We should unite "four friends," strive for the wavering middle elements, let them abandon illusions, not be bewitched by the imperialists, and resolutely participate in the anti-imperialist struggle of the broad masses of the people. In this meeting, all the representatives unanimously agreed to establish the Peiping Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, which is an expression of responding to this call.

### 北平院校教职筹委会代表  对各界代表会议的感想

　　北平院校教职筹委会代表
    对各界代表会议的感想
    这次由北平院校教职筹委会选举出席北平各界代表会议的代表一共有何戍双、罗常培、钱端升、杨贵贞、费孝通、胡原陵、严济慈、赵承信、翁独健、徐悲鸿、赵琏、王玢等十二人，会后发表感想，原文如下：
    关于北平市军管和市政各方面的工作报告，出席各首长的指示，各党派领袖的言论，和彭真同志对于这次会议的总结，在各报纸上已经详细刊载，我们不愿再重复报告，现在只是反映一些对于这次会议的感想。
    第一、我们在会场上首先听到的就是军管会和市政府各部分半年来的施政报告。这些工作都是照预定计划，稳步进行，从群众中来，到群众中去。但是在这些报告以前军管会和市政府的这些计划并没有公开发表大吹大擂。他们并不是没计划的，只是愿意做了再说，却不愿意说了不做；只愿意如数兑现，而不愿意多开支票，尤其没开过空头支票。回顾国民党反动派的统治时期怎样呢？他们每逢节日或纪念日总有皇皇的文电发表，每一机关大官的更迭总有洋洋大观的计划宣布，结果却是“好话说尽，坏事做尽”；只有计划，并无工作；只有预算，并无报销。专就这一点来说，在中国共产党领导下的人民政权，的确实践了“为政不在多言，顾力行何如耳”的古训。这绝不是国民党反动派所能赶得上的。
    第二、在这次会议里，朱总司令、周副主席、和董主席等，都提出发展生产的号召；代表们的提案也有十二件是提倡发展生产的。我们十二人也提出“请鼓励学校机关人员参加生产”一案，由大会通过，交有关机关团体协商办理。会场的情绪几乎一致响应这个号召，努力把消费的北平变成生产的北平，好把这个人民民主联合政府的新国都做成全国各大都市的典型。朱总司令的讲词中特别郑重提出：“从前的人以不事生产为清高，现在的公教人员必须同时兼营生产。”这的确可以叫我们这班教育文化工作者痛切的深省。我们提案的旨趣正和朱总司令的号召不谋而合。我们恳切希望知识分子能够贯彻“自己动手”，“自力更生”的精神，仿照一九三九到一九四二年延安实行精简节约，得到丰衣足食的好榜样，努力参加生产，以减轻人民的负担。
    第三、八月十三日下午五时二十分毛主席亲莅会场，对于代表们加以指示，希望现在这个各界代表会议一俟条件成熟就可执行北平市人民代表大会的职权，建立全市人民的最高政权。最后他拿出一封一个市民的信来，交给大会讨论他郑重提出希望代表们能够答复这个市民乃至所有北平市民的问题。毛主席离场后，立刻展开热烈的讨论。最后由彭真同志作总结，指出我们现在所处的是很困难的时期。不过这种困难是胜利中的困难，是进步中的困难。要想克服这种困难，第一要努力支前，消灭残余的反动势力；第二要发展生产；第三要严格管理金融。北平市人民乃至全国人民必须咬牙渡过这个难关。……谈到“努力支前”，我们这班教育文化工作者得要深切的了解，现在前线还有四百多万武装同志正在为扑灭残余的反动势力、解放全中国而奋斗。他们每人每月需要三百三十三斤小米。平均五十个农民才可以养一个兵。在以前，已经由一万一千七百五十万农民支持了三年的解放战争，现在还得继续倚靠他们。他们不单支持了前线，而且还得供给我们。照现在的薪给标准，一百五十个农民才能养一个教授，八十个农民才能养一个讲助，四十个农民才能养一个职员。所以我们必须严格地厉行节约支前，才算对得起农民，才算对得起前线四百万英勇的战士！
    第四、周副主席在“把革命进行到底建设新中国”的报告里特别提出：“建设新中国所依靠的就是由人民民主统一战线建立的人民民主专政，现在我们不单要扩大这个战线，而且要保持它的巩固，要求内部的合作和批评。”这次的北平市各界代表会议就是在中国共产党领导下的人民民主统一战线的大成功。它的主要目标就在“团结四个朋友，消灭三个敌人，完成两大任务”。由这局部大团结，已经树立了全国大团结的基础。代表的阶级，自工、农、小资产阶级以至于民族资本家；代表的年龄从八十几岁到十五岁；象这样各界人民的大团结真是亘古未有的盛事！开会时大家热烈辩论，知无不言，言无不尽地去追求真理；却又无时无地不融融泄泄地团契象一家人。尤其使我们知识分子兴奋的，就是工农代表们力量的充实，感情的真挚，意志的坚定，真叫我们这班脑力劳动者相形见绌。所以脑力劳动者应该常向体力劳动者看齐，才不会犹豫动摇，变成红娘子里的李信，或艾奇逊白皮书里所谓“民主个人主义”的拥护者！我们应该团结“四个朋友”，争取犹豫动摇的中间分子，让他们丢掉幻想，不受帝国主义者的蛊惑，毅然决然参加广大人民的反帝斗争。在这次会议中，各代表一致赞成成立中苏友好协会北平分会，就是响应这个号召的表示。
