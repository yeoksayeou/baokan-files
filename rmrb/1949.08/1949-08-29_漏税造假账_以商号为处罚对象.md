　　Tax Evasion and False Accounting
　　Penalties Applied to Businesses

Editor:
　　I am from a county outside Beiping and run a business in Beiping. I am an amateur when it comes to accounting matters, so I hired a shopkeeper. I have never interfered with the affairs of the shop. Now, due to unsustainable losses, I have suspended business and am settling the accounts. After the shopkeeper handed over the accounts to me, I discovered many discrepancies and instances of false accounting and tax evasion. I was unaware of these activities. Regarding the tax evasion issue, I would like to ask:

　　1. What is the penalty for creating false accounts and underreporting business tax and stamp tax?

　　2. If the owner is unaware of the tax evasion and false accounting, and it is solely the shopkeeper's doing, who is responsible?

　　3. If the owner reports the tax evasion to the authorities, will the amount of the fine be reduced, and to what extent (if the owner is responsible)?

　　4. If the shopkeeper is solely responsible, what happens if the shopkeeper has no money?

　　Daxing

Mr. Daxing:

　　Regarding your questions, the Tax Bureau has responded as follows:

　　Editor

　　1. Those who intend to evade taxes by forging account books or falsely reporting business income or revenue shall be ordered to pay the tax arrears, and shall also be fined one to ten times the evaded business tax and forty to sixty times the evaded stamp tax. However, this is a general penalty, and special circumstances may be handled with discretion.

　　2. Whoever commits tax evasion and false accounting is responsible, but the penalty is applied to the business.

　　3. If a business can voluntarily report tax evasion, penalties will naturally be reduced as much as possible at our discretion.

　　4. The penalty is applied to the business.

　　漏税造假账
  　以商号为处罚对象编辑同志：
    我是一个外县人，在北平开买卖。对于柜务我是外行，故聘有掌柜。我向来不问铺中事情；今因赔累不堪暂停营业，清理帐目。掌柜将帐交给我以后，发现帐中有很多不符之处，同时并有假帐漏税之处。这些勾当我都不知道。关于漏税问题，请问：
    一、作假帐，漏报营业税、印花税等，应该罚多少倍？
    二、漏税作假帐东家并不知道，只是掌柜一人作的，责任由谁负？
    三、东家将漏税事情告发官方，对罚款的数目是否要减轻，应减轻到什么程度（如果应东家负责的话）？
    四、如果由掌柜自己负责，若是掌柜没钱怎么办？  大兴大兴先生：
    你询问的问题承税务局答复如下：
　　编者
    一、意图逃税而伪造帐簿，或虚为填报营业收入额或收益额者，除责令补税外，并处以所漏营业税一倍至十倍、印花税四十倍至六十倍之罚锾，但这是一般处罚，若有特殊情形，还可酌情处理。
    二、漏税作假帐，什么人作的，就由什么人负责，不过处罚的对象是以商号为对象。
    三、商号漏税如能自行告发，当然酌情尽量予以减轻处罚。
    四、处罚是以商号为对象。　　　　（北平市人民政府税务局）
