The enlightenment era of physics in China was roughly fifty years ago. At that time, the social situation in China was on the eve of the capitalist democratic revolution, and intellectuals fervently demanded to change the backward agricultural economy into an advanced industrial economy. Physics, like other natural sciences, was introduced to China by intellectuals from Europe and the United States. Thirty years ago, this science took root in China at an astonishing speed. Under the leadership of many veteran physicists, Nango and Peking University trained a considerable number of basic physics personnel. Subsequently, the physics departments of Tsinghua, Zhejiang University, Wuhan University, Yenching University, Jiaotong University, Nankai University, Beijing Normal University, Peiyang University, and Zhongda University were successively established. Two independent research institutes were also established in the north and south, specializing in pure and applied physics research. In addition to the considerable success in training physics personnel, physics research also laid a foundation.

However, Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary rulers did not value the development of science. They did not recognize the importance of science to the country, and their comprador mentality prevented them from realizing that the independence of science is the foundation of national independence. At most, they regarded scientific research and education as decorations for the ruling class. Universities and research institutes rarely received genuine spiritual or material help from the government. The funding they provided for scientific work was ridiculously and pitifully small. Scientific workers had to overcome difficulties caused by government neglect and hard living conditions with great effort. Creative scientific work and inventions were generally ignored.

The Chinese people have always had a passion for knowledge. Although the obstruction of these reactionary rulers delayed the development of physics in China, physics, like other sister sciences, was growing and developing on Chinese soil. The Chinese Physical Society, which was established in Beiping in 1932 with only seventy-odd members, has grown to more than five hundred and seventy members today, an increase of sevenfold. These members are all graduates of science departments of universities at home and abroad who have made considerable contributions to the education, research, or application of physics. Since 1933, the Chinese Physical Society has published a journal called the "Chinese Journal of Physics," which publishes special research papers on Chinese physics. This physics journal has been exchanged with scientific publications from the Soviet Union and European and American countries, except for a four-year interruption during the Anti-Japanese War. Its excellent quality and rich content have been valued by the international scientific community. To date, the journal has published seven volumes and four issues, a total of sixteen books, containing more than one hundred excellent physics papers. More results of the efforts of Chinese physics workers, due to the neglect of the reactionary government and the difficulty of funding, could not be published in China in time, and could only be published in scientific journals with established positions abroad. Many excellent Chinese physicists, due to the social order of the reactionary rule era and the reactionary government's neglect of science, were often oppressed by a sense of frustration and left their motherland. They felt that they were not important to their country, useless, and out of touch with the needs of their country. Especially in 1937, when Japanese imperialism frantically attacked the Chinese people, scientific workers carried their only instruments and books, traveled long distances, and re-established their laboratories in the mountains of the southwest and northwest under extremely difficult conditions. However, these tragic encounters did not destroy the perseverance of Chinese scientific workers. The crystallization of their efforts in physics was no less than seven or eight hundred important papers: their contents included atomic and molecular physics, nuclear physics, cosmic rays, solid-state physics, theoretical physics, and applied physics. Chinese physics workers, in a neglected situation, not only worked hard in their posts but also widely participated in scientific work in other sister sciences, such as optical factories, metal smelting, mining, meteorology, vacuum tube manufacturing, and other industrial sectors, all with the footprints of physics scientific workers. In addition, they also educated the outstanding children of the Chinese people. For many years, many of their students went into the ranks of the people in groups and participated in the cause of people's liberation. The rigorous scientific training they received, after they gained revolutionary consciousness, helped them work more scientifically in the ranks of the people. Today, our two forces have joined forces again, and our feeling is very excited.

Under the oppression of reactionary rule, the activities of Chinese physics workers were isolated from the activities of the people. In addition to openly or covertly resisting the reactionary government, most physics workers retreated to the laboratories they created and did various scientific research. On the eve of the great liberation, workers in universities and research institutes in the north and south respectively stood firm at their posts to greet the victory of the people. No important physics worker in the country succumbed to Chiang Kai-shek's threats and inducements to go to Taiwan or Guangdong with him. When the barriers separating science and the people were destroyed by the People's Liberation Army, the future was infinitely bright. When this light shines on the physics research and education departments that have been blocked by darkness for a long time, we find that the past achievements of Chinese physics workers can also be regarded as a rich people's property. Today, after reviewing the achievements of the national physics work departments, Peking University has made contributions in molecular spectroscopy, electron gas scattering, and quantum theory; Zhejiang University has made contributions in nuclear physics, mercury sputtering, nickel plating on steel, relativity, and the study of phosphorescent materials; Zhongda University has made contributions in flotation metallurgy, measuring water depth with sound waves, and quantum theory research; The Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica in Nanjing has made contributions in geomagnetic measurement, crystallography, and instrument manufacturing; Peiyang University has made contributions in fluid mechanics; The Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica in Beiping has made contributions in spectroscopy, microscope manufacturing, physical exploration, radium research, and crystal oscillators for radio; Tsinghua University has made contributions in X-rays, gamma rays, nuclear physics, statistical mechanics, fluid mechanics, elastic mechanics, relativity, and vacuum tube research; Wuhan University has made contributions in ionospheric research, and the physics departments of other universities across the country, such as Yenching University, Normal University, Central China University, and Datong University, have also made considerable gains and practical laboratories.

Even so, past Chinese physics did not achieve its due strength and did not develop into a broad and systematic activity. It has never been connected with the lives of the people and has not been integrated with industrial production. The efforts of physics workers are individual and scattered, and their achievements are isolated.

The great victory of the People's Liberation cause ended the old era and ushered in a new era. Under the correct leadership of the people's leader Chairman Mao, scientific workers will unswervingly rush to a bright future. They will bear the responsibility of consolidating the victory of people's democracy and building a new democratic motherland. This team of physics scientific workers belonging to the people is not large, but it can be regarded as well-trained—thanks to the wholehearted nurturing of the physics community predecessors. In the face of the people's victory with its immense radiance, they will abandon the passive attitude of retreating to the laboratory or watching abroad, transform themselves, study hard, actively enter the great ranks of the people, and serve the people. Faced with this victory of the revolution, scientific workers must complete the above tasks, and the scientific level of the masses must be improved. To achieve this goal, on the one hand, a large number of elementary, secondary, and higher schools are needed, and a large number of teachers must be cultivated; on the other hand, production must be increased, new productivity must be discovered, and means of production must be found. For these new needs, scientific institutions and laboratories must be established and equipped on a large scale. Physics scientific workers wholeheartedly ask workers in other sister scientific fields for cooperation so that they can move forward hand in hand.

    中国的物理学
    钱伟长执笔
    本文系中国物理学会理事会，和出席中华全国第一次科学工作者代表大会筹备会的物理学工作者的共同意见，经本人整理后曾由吴有训先生在中华全国教育工作者代表会议筹备会报告，最后由本人执笔整理。本文如有错误，概由执笔者负责。——伟长附白
    我国物理学的启蒙时代，大概是在五十年前，那时我国的社会情况正是资本主义民主革命的前夕，知识分子热烈要求改变落后的农业经济社会成为先进的工业经济社会。物理学和其他自然科学一样，被知识分子自欧美介绍到了中国。到三十年前，这门科学以惊人的速度，在中国生了根。那时的南高、北大在许多前辈物理学家领导之下，训练了不少物理学的基本人员。随后清华、浙大、武大、燕京、交大、南开、北平师大、北洋、中大各校物理系相继成立；南北又创办了两个独立的研究所，专事纯粹和应用物理学的研究，除了物理人员训练，已经相当地成功外，物理学的研究，也打下了基础。
    但是蒋介石和他的反动统治者们却并不重视科学的发展，他们不认识科学对于国家的重要，他们的买办劣根性使他们不能认识到科学的独立是民族独立的基础。他们最多把科学的研究和教育当作执政者的装饰品。大学和研究所很少得到政府在精神上或物质上的真正帮助，他们给与科学工作的经费少得可笑又可怜，科学工作者必须用极大的努力，去克服由于政府漠视和生活艰苦所造成的困难，有创造性的科学工作和发明等等照例是不受注意的。
    中国人民素有求知的热忱；这些反动统治的阻挠虽然延缓了中国物理学的发展，但是物理学和其他姊妹科学一样，在中国土地上到底是在生长发育。中国物理学会自民国二十一年在北平成立时，才七十几人，到今天已有会员五百七十余人，增加了七倍。这些会员都是国内外大学理科毕业后在物理学的教育研究或应用上有相当贡献的。中国物理学会自民国二十二年起出版一种名称“中国物理学报”的刊物，登载关于中国物理学的专题研究论文，这个物理学报除在抗战期间中断四年外，一直与苏联及欧美各国科学刊物交换着，它的优良素质和丰富内容，受到国际科学界的重视。这个学报发行迄今，已出版七卷四期，共十六册，载有优良的物理论文百余篇。更多的中国物理学工作者努力的结果，因反动政府的漠视，经费的困难，无法及时在国内刊出，只能发表在国外各有地位的科学期刊。也有不少优秀的中国物理学者，由于反动统治时代的社会秩序和反动政府忽视科学的结果，经常为一种苦闷的感觉所压迫着而离开了祖国，他们认为他们自己对本国并不重要，无用，和本国的需要脱节。尤其在一九三七年日本帝国主义疯狂进攻中国人民时期，科学工作者们携带着他们仅有的仪器和书籍，长途跋涉，在西南，西北山地里重新在万分困难下建立起他们的实验室来。但是这些悲惨的遭遇，并没有摧毁中国科学工作者的毅力，他们在物理学方面努力的结晶为不下七八百篇的重要论文：他们的内容包括原子及分子物理，原子核物理，宇宙线，固体物理，理论物理，应用物理各方面。中国的物理学工作者们在被漠视的境况下，不仅在自己的岗位上努力工作着，并且广泛地参加其他姊妹科学门类的科学工作，象光学工厂，冶炼金属，采矿，气象，真空管制造及其他各种工业部门，都有物理的科学工作者的足迹。此外他们还教育着中国人民的优秀子弟。若干年来，他们的许多学生成群结队的走进人民的队伍，参加了人民解放事业。他们所受到的科学严格训练，在他们得到了革命觉悟之后，帮助了他们更科学地在人民的队伍里工作着。今天我们两支部队又会师在一起，我们的感觉是非常兴奋的。
    中国物理学工作者的活动，在反动统治压迫之下，是和人民的活动隔离着的。物理学工作者除公开地或隐蔽地反抗着反动政府外，多数都退守到自己创造的实验室里，做着各种各样的科学研究，在伟大的解放前夕，南北各大学及研究所的工作者们，都分别坚守在岗位上迎接人民的胜利。全国重要的物理学工作者，没有一个屈服在蒋介石的威胁利诱之下，跟他上台湾或广东去。当隔离着科学和人民的藩篱，一旦被人民解放军所摧毁之后，前途是一片无限的光明。当这片光明照耀着久被黑暗封锁的物理学研究教育部门时，我们发现过去中国物理学工作者的劳绩也还算得上一份丰富的人民财产。今天检视一下全国物理学工作部门的成就，计有北大在分子光谱学，电子气体散射，量子论等贡献，浙大在原子核物理，水银溅散，钢上涂镍，相对论，磷光质之研究，中大之浮炼金法，以声波测水深度，量子论研究等工作，南京中央研究院物理研究所之地磁测量，结晶学，仪器制造，北洋的流体力学，北平研究院物理研究所的光谱学，显微镜制造，物理探矿，镭学研究，无线电用之水晶振荡片等工作，和清华的爱克斯射线，丙种射线，原子核物理，统计力学，流体力学，弹性体力学，相对论，真空管研究；武大的游离层研究，以及全国其它各校如燕京、师大、华中、大同等校物理系，都有了相当的收获和切实的实验室。
    虽然如此，过去的中国物理学却没有达到它所应该有的壮大力量，没有发展成一种广泛的、有系统的活动，它始终没有和人民的生活连系在一起，并没有与工业生产结合起来。物理学工作者的努力是个体的，散漫的，他们的成就是孤立的。
    人民解放事业的伟大胜利，结束了旧时代，展开了新时代。科学工作者们在人民的领袖毛主席正确领导之下，将义不容辞地奔向光明的前途。要负起巩固人民民主的胜利和建设新民主主义的祖国的责任来，这个属于人民的物理科学工作者的队伍虽不大，但还算得上精练——这要感谢物理学界前辈们的全心养护。他们将在这万丈光芒的人民胜利的前面，脱去退守实验室或在国外观望的消极态度，改造自己，努力学习，积极地走进伟大的人民行列，为人民服务。面对着这一次革命的胜利，科学工作者们要完成上面的任务，群众的科学水平必须提高。为达到这一目的，一方面需要大量的初等、中等、高等的学校，和培植大量的教师；另一方面需要提高生产，发掘新的生产力，生产手段。为了这些新的需要，科学机关和实验室就必须要大量地建立和装备起来。物理科学工作者们全心全意向其他各姊妹科学门类的工作者要求合作，以便携手向前迈进。
