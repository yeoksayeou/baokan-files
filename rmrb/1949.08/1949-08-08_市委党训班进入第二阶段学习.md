    Municipal Party Training Class Enters Second Stage of Learning
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Party Member Training Class of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China entered the second stage of learning on the Party Program, Party Member Cultivation, and Branch Work starting from the first of this month. On that day, Comrade Xiang Ziming, the person in charge of the Party Training Class, reported to the students a preliminary summary of the first two weeks of study, pointing out that everyone is striving to combine theory with practice, has a preliminary understanding of historical materialism and the current general policy, and knows to use class viewpoints to analyze problems. However, there are still some shortcomings, such as the learning plan is not specific and does not conform to the principle of "less but refined"; the leadership issued discussion outlines in advance, which limited everyone's thinking and speech; some groups did not expose their thoughts enough; the content of the group and the mutual aid group overlapped, affecting reading time; and some comrades were not careful when listening to reports and reading documents, and could not raise questions, and were impatient to listen to others' speeches at meetings, were arrogant, and did not delve into things. Accordingly, we should strengthen the planning and organization of learning leadership and strive to implement the policy of "less but refined, connecting with reality, and transforming ourselves." For intellectuals, their incorrect learning attitude should be criticized, and it should be proposed that they should be modest and serious in their studies. When talking about the study of Party member cultivation, Comrade Xiang wanted everyone to deeply reflect on their thoughts; in studying branch work, they should be divided into groups according to the branch schools to discuss and check the branch work of the various schools in the last semester. The training class has now drawn up a second stage learning plan. This week, in addition to a rough reading of Party member cultivation and a report on amending the Party Constitution, it is planned to study the cultivation of Party members in ideological consciousness. This study has now been launched in groups and branch general meetings for discussion. Next week, it is planned to study the cultivation of Party members in organization, democratic centralism, and school branch work.

    市委党训班进入第二阶段学习
    【本报讯】中共北平市委会学校党员训练班，从本月一日起，进入第二阶段党纲、党员修养及支部工作的学习。在当天，党训班负责同志项子明向学员报告了两周来第一阶段学习的初步总结，指出大家正努力走向理论与实际的结合，初步认识了唯物史观和当前的总政策，知道了要用阶级观点分析问题。但还存在着某些缺点，如学习计划不具体，不合乎少而精的原则；领导上先发讨论提纲，限制了大家的思想和发言；有些小组暴露思想作得不够；小组与互助小组内容重复，影响到阅读时间，还有一部分同志在听报告、读文件时不仔细，提不出问题，开会时不耐心听别人发言，自高自大，不钻研。据此，应加强学习领导上的计划性和组织性，努力贯彻少而精、联系实际、改造自己的方针。对于知识分子，应批评其不正确的学习态度，提出要虚心，要认真学习。谈到党员修养的学习，项同志要大家深刻反省思想；学习支部工作，就按各校支部分组讨论，并检查上学期各校的支部工作。现训练班已订出第二阶段学习计划。本周预定除粗读党员修养和修改党章报告外，并学习党员在思想意识上的修养，现此项学习已在小组和支部大会上展开讨论。下周拟学习党员在组织上的修养、民主集中制，以及学校支部工作等项目。
