    Watching "Steel Will"
    Cao Yifan
    The famous Soviet film "Steel Will" is also known as "The Miracle of the Real Man." The film tells the story of a heroic Soviet fighter pilot, Captain Meresiev, during the Soviet-German war against fascism. His plane is shot down by the enemy, and he injures both legs, landing in the snowy and icy Black Forest. When he discovers that he is still fifty kilometers from the front line, he decides to walk ten thousand steps every day. The pursuit of wild beasts, the severe cold of the snow, and the festering of his legs do not discourage him. He crawls, crawling and rolling for eighteen days, before finding his unit. He is transferred to a hospital and fitted with two prosthetic legs. In the hospital, he reads a book about Karpovich, who was able to fly with only one leg, and he decides to practice walking again, to fly again and fight the enemy. In the end, he gets his wish.

    I used to think that my will was firm, and that I was determined to serve the people. I was very confident that I could endure hardship and overcome difficulties, but after watching "Steel Will," I realized that I was still far behind! Eighteen days of fighting against wind, snow, and wild beasts, and the unwavering determination to practice flying without two real legs, are truly worthy of our study. We should remember, and remember well, Comrade Stalin's famous saying: "When a fishing boat encounters a storm at sea, some sailors abandon their oars and lose their lives, while others remain calm and overcome the storm." We should be like the latter sailors, cultivate a steel will, overcome difficulties, and serve the people wholeheartedly.

    This film shows how much the Soviet people love their socialist motherland, a country without classes or exploitation. Meresiev is determined to rejoin the air force, and the nurses, political commissar, and people in the hospital are so enthusiastic in helping him. During the test flight, Meresiev does not reveal that he has prosthetic legs, fearing that he will not be allowed to participate in combat. When he returns to the battlefield, he is only three minutes away from running out of fuel, but Meresiev still bravely shoots down two enemy planes. This heroic behavior, this spirit of having only the motherland in his heart and disregarding life and death, is truly worthy of our study. During our War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, there were also many heroes and meritorious people who regarded death as going home for the sake of the people's liberation. We hope to see more heroic figures of the people's sons and daughters on the screen in the future.

    看“钢铁意志”
    曹一帆
    苏联名片“钢铁意志”又名“真实人的奇迹”。这个片子的内容，是在反法西斯的苏德之战中，苏联的一位英勇的驱逐机飞行师——米列谢也夫上尉，被敌人将飞机击坏，自己两脚受伤，落在冰天雪地的黑林地带，当他发现自己离火线还有五十公里时，决定每天走一万步，野兽的追踪，冰雪的严寒，两脚的溃烂，种种困难并没有使他灰心，他爬着，一直连爬带滚走了十八天，才找到部队，转入医院，换了两只假脚。病中他看了关于以前一只脚尚能飞行的卡尔波维奇的一本书，便决心再练习走路，再驾飞机与敌人作战，结果他总算如愿以偿了。
    以前自己还以为自己意志很坚定，是决心为人民服务的。很自信地以为自己能吃苦，能克服困难，看了“钢铁意志”后才感到自己还差得远！十八天与风雪猛兽的搏斗，没有雨只脚还决心练习飞行的坚决意志，实在值得我们学习。应该记住，牢牢记住斯大林同志的名言：“渔船在海中遇到了狂风，有的水手弃了桨，丧了命，有的却非常沉着战胜风波。”，我们应作后面的水手，锻炼成钢铁的意志，克服困难，诚心诚意的为人民服务。
    这片子表现出苏联人民对于自己的社会主义的无阶级无剥削的祖国，是怎样的爱护。米列谢也夫决心再参加空军，护士、政委以及医院里的人是多么热心帮助他。在飞机试飞的时候，米列谢也夫不曾说出自己是假脚，恐怕不叫自己去参加战斗；重上战场时，差三分钟就没有汽油了，但米列谢也夫还英勇地击毁敌机两架，这种英勇的行为，这种心中只有祖国，而把生死置诸度外的精神，实在是值得我们学习。在我国抗日与解放战争中，亦有多少为人民解放，视死如归的英雄功臣，我们希望今后在银幕上，能多多看到人民健儿的英勇雄姿。
