　　The Guarantee of Production Method Development in Socialist Society is Criticism and Self-Criticism
    Yang Luo
    In socialist society, classes are eliminated. Although there are contradictions between city and countryside, production and consumption during the transition period, they are basically not antagonistic contradictions. At this time, the productive forces and production relations are very harmonious, leaving only the contradiction between man and nature. The foundation of social development is the method of production, and the strong development of production methods in socialist society is guaranteed by the life consciousness of criticism and self-criticism (competition is one of the forms). This consciousness of criticism and self-criticism is produced by socialist society. But the reason why some people doubt this is because these people are bound by the special development laws of class society.

　　社会主义社会中生产方法发展的保证是批评与自我批评
    杨洛
    在社会主义社会中，阶级消灭了。在过渡时期虽也有城与乡的矛盾，生产与消费的矛盾等，但基本上不是对抗性的矛盾了。这时生产力与生产关系十分协和，只留下人与自然的矛盾。作为社会发展底基础是生产方法，而社会主义社会中生产方法的强大发展，是以批评与自我批评的生活意识来保证的（竞赛是形式之一）。这种批评与自我批评的意识又是由社会主义社会所产生的。但所以有人要怀疑这一点，是因为这些人受了阶级社会特殊发展法则束缚住思想的原故。
