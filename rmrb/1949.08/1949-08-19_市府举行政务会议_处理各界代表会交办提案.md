　　Municipal Government Holds Executive Meeting
  　To Handle Proposals Submitted by Representatives from All Sectors
    [This Municipality News] The Beiping Municipal People's Government held an executive meeting on the morning of the 17th to discuss the various proposals passed by the All-Circles Representatives Conference and submitted to the Municipal Government for handling. Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu, on behalf of the Municipal Government, accepted the conference's resolutions on these proposals at the final day of the Representatives Conference. The executive meeting reviewed the past municipal work and decided that the various tasks assigned by the conference should be handled separately by the relevant units based on what has been done, what is being done, and what has not been done. For what has been done, a systematic summary should be made immediately; for what is being done, a report should be written outlining the work plan and progress, and the work should continue. Most importantly, for what has not been done, concrete and feasible plans should be formulated quickly based on the actual situation, priorities, and urgency, for what can be done. If something cannot be done, the reasons should be explained and submitted for discussion at the next executive meeting.
