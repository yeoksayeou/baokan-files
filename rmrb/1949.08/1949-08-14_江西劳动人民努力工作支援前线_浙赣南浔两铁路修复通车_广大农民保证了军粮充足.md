Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 13th: Workers and peasants in the liberated areas of Jiangxi Province are actively restoring transportation and collecting grain and fodder to support the front lines. By the end of July, through the efforts of employees of the Jiangxi Provincial Highway Bureau and with the active assistance of farmers in various regions, 89 highway bridges destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit troops and partially damaged by floods have been repaired. The highway network centered on Nanchang City, extending north to Jiujiang, west to Shanggao, south to Taihe and Nancheng, and northeast to the borders of Zhejiang and Anhui provinces, totaling 1,200 kilometers in length, has been fully opened to traffic. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Nanxun railways have also been fully opened to traffic thanks to the efforts of all employees in rushing repairs. The employees of the Nanchang Repair Factory, under the slogan of stepping up the repair of vehicles and supporting the front lines, repaired 34 vehicles in half a month. Workers at the Nanchang Shipping Bureau have salvaged two cargo ships with a displacement of over 100 tons and one steamer that were sunk in the Gan River by Kuomintang bandit troops. The vast numbers of farmers in eastern, northern, and central Jiangxi are actively responding to the call of the People's Government to raise grain and fodder and support the front lines. By the end of July, the entire area had completed borrowing 100 million jin of grain, guaranteeing the grain supply for the People's Liberation Army.
