Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th. The Chinese people are closely watching the Australian government's recent atrocities of mass persecution of overseas Chinese in Australia under the pretext of the so-called "Wartime Refugees Deportation Act." According to Sydney news: Australian Immigration Minister Calwell ordered the arrest of 500 overseas Chinese on the 24th and their deportation. The Australian government has a long history of anti-Chinese policies. As early as April this year, many overseas Chinese were detained. On the 20th of this month, the Sydney Chinese Restaurant was unreasonably searched by Australian police, and 20 Chinese sailors were arrested at the time. Five Chinese sailors were also arrested in Adelaide. Personnel from the Australian Immigration Office were rude to the arrested overseas Chinese, even preventing them from packing their luggage. This anti-Chinese atrocity by the Australian government has aroused the anger of overseas Chinese. The Overseas Chinese Seamen's Union has appealed to the Supreme Court, demanding that the so-called "Wartime Refugees Deportation Act" be ruled invalid.

　　澳政府反动暴行
  　大举迫害华侨
    竟下令逮捕驱逐五百名侨胞出境
    中国人民正密切注视
    【新华社北平二十六日电】中国人民正密切注视着澳大利亚政府最近借口所谓“战时难民出境法”大举迫害在澳华侨的暴行。据悉尼消息：澳移民部长卡尔威尔已于二十四日下令逮捕五百名华侨，将他们驱逐出境。澳政府实行排华由来已久，早在今年四月，即曾有华侨多人被拘押。本月二十日，悉尼中国饭店曾被澳警无理搜查，当时有二十名中国海员被捕，在阿得雷德也有五名中国海员被捕。澳大利亚移民事务处人员对被捕华侨态度蛮横，甚至不让他们收拾行李。澳政府此种排华暴行，已引起侨胞的愤怒。华侨海员工会已上诉最高法院，要求判决所谓“战时难民出境法”无效。
