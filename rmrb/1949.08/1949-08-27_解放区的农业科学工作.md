　　Agricultural Science Work in the Liberated Areas
    Le Tianyu

    The new direction of agricultural science in the Liberated Areas began with the famous Nanniwan policy in 1940. At that time, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, under enemy blockade, put forward this policy in order to achieve self-sufficiency and build the border region. After the decision on the new educational policy of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was announced, this new direction was more clearly affirmed. After an article entitled "Discussion on the Correct Application of Heredity" was published in "Chinese Culture," one of the important publications in Yan'an in 1941, there were no more technical measures of the Morgan and other idealist schools in the various regions of the Liberated Areas.

    Under the call and encouragement of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Party, government, military, civil organizations, and schools all participated in the agricultural production work in the direction of Nanniwan. The new direction of agricultural science not only laid a correct foundation in the colleges but also took broad root in the countryside and the army. Now I will cite a few examples to talk about it.

    First, regarding increasing yields: First of all, we discovered Zhu Laohan, a hero of maize cultivation, in Nanniwan. He could obtain a one-third increase in quality and quantity with ordinary seeds and general cultivation conditions. Under the encouragement of the Nanniwan policy, this cultivation method was quickly and widely imitated by the masses, the army, government organizations, schools, etc., and applied to the cultivation of various crops.

    Second, regarding overcoming the difficulties of sowing in arid farming areas: Based on the development of plant physiology theory, the Yan'an Institute of Natural Sciences organized the water-flooding sowing method in the arid farming areas near Wayaobao, making it quite perfect, and widely applied it to planting tobacco leaves, vegetables, indigo, and small seeds of various medicinal plants. The results were quite considerable. On the first day of flooding and sowing the seeds, the ideal seedlings could be caught on the second day, solving the difficulty of raising seedlings in arid farming areas.

    Third, regarding transforming crops to meet needs: Due to the shortage of seeds, we changed the sugar beet, which originally took two years to produce seeds, to produce seeds in one year on the Taihang Mountains, and the masses near Changzhi were also able to do so. In the autumn-dry areas near the mountains of Wu'an, Linxian, and Huixian, because autumn wheat often could not be planted, we studied the method of spring planting of autumn wheat based on the theory of plant physiology and improved the technology of vernalization, so that farmers could also sow autumn wheat in the spring, shortening the growing time of autumn wheat in farmland and avoiding the harm of autumn drought.

    Fourth, overcoming the difficulty of raw material shortage in agricultural product processing: Because we were blockaded by the enemy and lacked sugar, and the conditions for agricultural product processing were very difficult, we gathered workers, farmers, retired soldiers, primary school teachers, students, professors, etc., and established a small sugar beet sugar experimental factory in Wujiazaizi Working Station, Zichang County, northern Shaanxi. Using very simple raw materials, lime and sugar beet, and very simple equipment, iron pots and earthenware jars, we produced more than ten thousand catties of sugar after several collective studies. In less than three years, the nearby masses had spread from Zichang to Xichuan, Suide, Jingbian, and other regions, and farmers widely and automatically learned the method of handmade sugar production. This method has developed from Taiyue and Taihang to Shijiazhuang. In the suburbs of Shijiazhuang, a total of twenty-two villages have organized sugar beet cooperative farms and installed a machine sugar factory that produces ten tons of snowflake sugar per day.

    Fifth, in the transformation of old veterinarians: Because the mortality rate of livestock was quite high and the lack of animal power in rural areas was extremely serious, a large number of veterinarians were urgently needed, but the cultivation of a large number of veterinarians could not be achieved in the short term, and serum and Western medicines were very scarce. Therefore, we carried out the transformation of old veterinarians, so that old veterinarians gradually became scientific and quickly served the masses by using their experience. We established thirty-four veterinary work stations in Taiyue, Taihang, northern Shaanxi, and other regions. Each station also organized medical teams, which could diagnose and treat five or six hundred to more than two thousand livestock per day. Even in these dozens of veterinary stations, hundreds of thousands of livestock were diagnosed and treated every year, solving part of the veterinary problems in rural areas.

    The above are just a few examples to illustrate that agricultural science in the Liberated Areas could start from scratch in hardship and difficulty, on the one hand, because of the new direction of agricultural science that developed from the Nanniwan policy, which sought truth from facts, and on the other hand, because of the implementation of the mass line of agricultural science. Therefore, in science itself, the old world's idealism and other methods have been removed, and in the application of science, the method of combining theory with practice has been adopted. Therefore, we can be honest, down-to-earth, combine with reality in the vast rural areas, bury ourselves in hard work, create collectively, and overcome difficulties.

    Comrades who are engaged in natural science should be vigilant that if what we study does not adopt the mass line, does not absorb the production experience of the broad masses of farmers, and does not improve them from the existing level of the broad masses of farmers, but is divorced from the masses and divorced from reality, then it will become a pedant. We should learn more from Soviet scholars and make ourselves scientists of the people. For example, in agricultural biological science, we should learn from Michurin, Lysenko, and others, because they have great achievements. The Soviet Union is the cradle of progressive science in the world, and their various sciences are worth learning from.

　　解放区的农业科学工作
    乐天宇
    解放区农业科学的新方向，是从一九四○年著名的南泥湾政策下开始的。当时陕甘宁边区在敌人的封锁下，为了求自给自足，建设边区，提出了这个政策。等到中共中央新教育方针的决定公布以后，更明确的肯定了这一新的方向。一九四一年延安重要刊物之一“中国文化”发表了一篇文章“遗传正确应用的商讨”以后，在解放区的各地区，已经再没有莫尔干等唯心论学派的技术施设。
    在朱总司令号召鼓励之下，党政军民机关学校，都参加了南泥湾方向的农业生产工作，农业科学的新方向，不但是在学院中打下了正确的基础，而且在农村中，军队中，也扎下了广大的根基。现在我举出几件事例来谈谈。
    第一、关于提高产量方面：首先我们在南泥湾发现了玉蜀黍的栽培英雄朱老汉，他能用一般的种子，一般的耕作条件，获得在品质上数量上三分之一的提高，在南泥湾政策鼓励之下，这种栽培法，很快地，很广泛地为群众，军队，机关，学校等所仿效，而且应用在各种农作物的栽培方面去。
    第二、关于克服旱农区播种的困难：延安自然科学院根据植物生理学理论的发展，将瓦窑堡附近旱农区域内的水漫播种法，整理得相当的完善，并且广泛的应用在种烟叶，种菜，种蓝，以及种植各种药用植物的小型种籽，成绩很是可观，第一天漫播种籽，第二天就可以捉到理想中出土的小苗芽，解决了旱农区域内养苗子的困难问题。
    第三、关于改造农作物适应需要：为了种籽的缺乏，我们在太行山上，将两年才能打籽的甜菜，改为一年打籽，而且在长治附近的群众也能这样做了。我们在武安、林县、辉县等靠山的秋旱地区，因为秋麦经常种不下，我们根据了植物生理学的理论，研究了秋麦春种的方法，提高春化作用的技术，使农民在春天也能播种秋麦，缩短秋麦在农地中生长的时间，避免秋旱的为害。
    第四、在农产加工方面克服原料缺乏的困难：由于我们被敌人封锁，缺乏砂糖，而农产加工的条件又非常困难，我们集合了工人、农民、荣退军人、小学教师、学生、教授等，在陕北子长县吴家寨子工作站建立了一座小小的甜菜砂糖试验厂，用很简单的原料，石灰及甜菜，用很简单的设备，铁锅及瓦缸，我们经过几次的集体研究，制出了万多斤的砂糖，我们在不到三年的光景，附近的群众已由子长传播到西川、绥德、靖边等地区，农民广泛的自动的学习了手工业制造砂糖的方法，这种方法已由太岳太行发展到了石家庄，在石家庄的近郊，一共有二十二个村庄，已经组织了甜菜合作农场，装置了一座每天出十吨雪花糖的机器糖厂。
    第五、在改造旧兽医方面：我们为了牲畜死亡率相当的大，农村畜力的缺乏，极需要大量的兽医，但大量兽医的培养，不是短期所能作到的，而且血清西药非常缺乏，于是我们进行了旧兽医的改造工作，使旧兽医渐渐的科学化，利用其经验部分很快的就能为群众服务，我们在太岳、太行、陕北等地区成立了三十四个兽医工作总站，每站又组织了医疗队，每天能诊治牲畜五六百头以至二千余头，即是在这几十个兽医站内，每年诊疗的牲畜也有几十万头之多，解决了一部分农村中兽医问题。
    以上是举出极少部分的事例，来说明解放区的农业科学，其所以能从艰苦困难之中，白手起家，一方面是由于从南泥湾政策下发展出来的实事求是的农业科学的新方向，一方面是由于执行了农业科学的群众路线。因此，在科学的本身，已将旧世界唯心论等方法去掉，在科学的应用方面，则是采取了理论结合实际的方法。因此才能老老实实，脚踏实地，在广大的农村中去结合实际，埋头实干，集体创造，克服困难。
    我们搞自然科学的同志们，应该警惕到，如果我们所研究的东西，不是采取群众路线，不吸收广大农民的生产经验，不从广大农民现有的水平去提高他们，而是脱离群众，脱离实际，那便会成一个学究。我们应该多向苏联的学者们学习，使我们自己成为人民的科学家，例如在农业生物科学方面，我们应该向米邱林、李森科等学习，因为他们是有很大的成就的。苏联是全世界进步科学的摇篮，他们的各种科学都值得我们学习。
