    Listening to a Lecture
    Hu Zhaolan, Beijing Normal University

    I look forward to listening to lectures every day, because every time I listen to a lecture, it solves some of my ideological problems to a greater or lesser extent. This time, listening to "Individual Freedom and Collective Freedom" has clarified several vague viewpoints for me.

    First, it corrected my view of the individual and the collective. I used to think that individuals had no future in a collective. I thought that the collective buried individual talent and restricted individual freedom. For example, Robinson Crusoe would never have acquired his independent living skills if he hadn't been shipwrecked on a desert island. However, after hearing the explanation of the exploitative relations in class society, I suddenly realized that no matter how talented a person is, they are useless without the collective. If Robinson Crusoe hadn't used the tools created by the collective (such as guns and planks), and the wisdom accumulated by the working people in the labor process, and tamed Friday and obtained the means of subsistence, he would not have been able to survive. Also, connecting it to some experiences in my personal life, I am convinced that the secluded life of wandering alone among green hills and clear waters, flowers and plants, is just another name for exploiting the fruits of the labor of the majority for the enjoyment of oneself. In fact, an individual who leaves the collective is like a fish out of water or a tree uprooted from the soil.

    Secondly, my class viewpoint began to become clear. Although I used to hate the feudal class, I always felt it was unreasonable for my family's land to be equally divided, believing that it violated "property freedom." Today, after hearing "Freedom and Class Struggle," I realized that labor created the world, and the oppression of the majority of the working people by the minority of the exploiting classes for thousands of years is the most unreasonable thing. "Land to the tiller" is actually returning the land to its original owner, taking back the property that the feudal class had infringed upon.

    In order to make the world a better place, only by allowing the working people to enjoy full freedom; if we want to maintain the "property freedom" of the feudal class and give them the freedom to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, it is tantamount to rejecting social progress and endangering the freedom of survival of the broad masses of working people, which is extremely wrong.

    Finally, it is a re-recognition of freedom. Although I vaguely knew that freedom does not come from nowhere and requires a considerable price to be paid, at the same time I believed that living a life without restraint is the ultimate freedom. Now I understand that individual freedom should be built on the basis of collective freedom, and only by serving the collective interests, including one's own, can one obtain true freedom.

    听讲座
    北师  胡肇兰
    我每天都希望听讲座，因为每次听过讲座以后，都或多或少的给我解决一些思想上的问题。这次听了“个人自由与集体自由”又给我弄清了几个模糊的观点。
    首先是纠正了对于个人与集体的看法。从前我认为个人在集体中是没有前途的。集体是埋没个人的天才和限制个人自由的，例如鲁滨逊如果不是漂流到荒岛上，决不会得到那一套独立生活的本领。然而听到阶级社会中的剥削关系的解释以后，我恍然大悟：原来无论是多么有天才的人物，若离开集体也是毫无用处的，鲁滨逊要不是利用了集体创造的工具（如手枪和船板）、利用了由劳动人民在劳动过程中积累起来的智慧，驯服了星期五，取得了生活资料，他是不可能生存的；又联系到我个人生活中的一些经验，所以我确信了独自徜徉于青山绿水，花草丛中的避世生涯，不过是剥削了多数人劳动的成果，而一己享受的别名，事实上，离开集体的个人，就象离水的鱼和离土的树一样。
    其次是阶级观点的开始明确。从前我虽然痛恨封建阶级，可是对于我家的土地被平分，总认为不合理，认为侵犯了“财产自由”，今天听到“自由与阶级斗争”，才弄清楚了：原来劳动创造了世界，几千年来多数劳动人民受少数剥削阶级的压迫，才实在是最不合理的，而“耕者有其田”，实际上是土地回老家，把封建阶级侵犯了的财产收回来。
    为了使世界更美好，只有叫劳动人民享有充分的自由；如果要维持封建阶级的“财产自由”和给他们以反革命活动的自由，就等于拒绝社会进步，并危害广大劳动人民的生存自由，这是极端错误的。
    最后是对于自由的再认识，从前虽然模模糊糊的知道自由不是凭空而来的，要付出相当的代价，可是同时又认为人活一世，无拘无束，才是自由到家。现在可明白了个人自由应建筑在集体自由的基础之上，只有服务于包括自己在内的集体利益中，才能得到真正的自由。
