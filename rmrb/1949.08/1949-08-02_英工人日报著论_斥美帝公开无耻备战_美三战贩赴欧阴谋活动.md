Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st: TASS, London, July 30th: Under the title "Unwelcome Foreigners," the local *Worker's Daily* attacks the "visit" to Europe by the U.S. Chiefs of Staff. After describing how the Great War of 1914 was prepared in secret, the *Worker's Daily* emphasizes that the present war is being prepared openly and shamelessly. The visit to Europe by the American Chiefs of Staff is part of this preparation. The paper writes: "There are no people more unwelcome than they are to Europe. As arrogant foreigners, they come to oppress and rule the British army for the purposes of America's reactionary war. They regard Western European countries as their satellites and cannon fodder. The Labour government's imperialist foreign policy has reduced Britain to a position of political, economic and military subordination to the United States."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st: The U.S. government is openly preparing for war. U.S. Army Chief of Staff Bradley, Naval Chief of Staff Denfield, and Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg flew to Frankfurt, West Germany, the site of the U.S. military headquarters, for this purpose on July 30th. U.S. officials announced that Bradley's itinerary in Europe would be as follows: 30th, Bradley et al. flew to West Germany and met with McCloy, the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany; August 2nd, meeting with U.S. staff in Germany; 3rd, going to London to meet with British staff; 4th, holding talks with representatives of Denmark and other countries arriving in London; 5th, going to Paris to meet with French staff and meeting with Montgomery, the commander of the so-called "Western European Union"; 6th, holding talks with representatives of Belgium and the Netherlands; 7th, going to Vienna; after which, they will return to the United States. According to the Associated Press, Bradley et al. have a dual mission on this trip: "1. To discuss the proposed military organization stipulated by the North Atlantic Treaty; 2. To conduct a direct study of U.S. troops stationed in Europe, most of which are concentrated in West Germany."

    斥美帝公开无耻备战
    美三战贩赴欧阴谋活动
    【新华社北平一日电】塔斯社伦敦七月三十日讯：在“不受欢迎的外国人”的标题下，此间工人日报抨击美参谋长“访”欧的事件。在叙述一九一四年的大战是秘密准备的以后，工人日报着重指出，现在的战争则是公开地和无耻地在准备着。美国参谋长的访欧，就是这一准备的一部分。该报写道：“访问欧洲的人没有比他们更不受欢迎的了。他们作为傲慢的外国人，为美国的反动战争的目的来压迫和统治英国军队。他们把西欧国家看成他们的卫星和炮灰。工党政府的帝国主义外交政策，已使英国降低到在政治、经济和军事上附属于美国的地位。”
    【新华社北平一日电】美国政府正在公开地准备战争。美陆军参谋总长布莱德雷、海军参谋总长邓菲尔德、空军参谋总长范登堡等已为此于七月三十日飞抵德境美军总部所在地法兰克福。美官方宣布，布莱德雷等访欧之行程如下：三十日，布莱德雷等飞往西德，并与德境美国军政府总督麦克洛埃会谈；八月二日，与德境美国参谋人员会谈；三日，赴伦敦与英国参谋人员会谈；四日，与抵达伦敦之丹麦及其他国家之代表举行会谈；五日，赴巴黎与法国参谋人员会谈，并会晤所谓“西欧联盟”的统帅蒙哥马利；六日，与比、荷两国的代表会谈；七日，赴维也纳；其后，即返美国。据美联社称，布莱德雷等此行负有双重使命：“一、讨论北大西洋公约所规定的拟议中的军事组织；二、对美国驻欧洲军队作一直接的研究，这些军队大部集中于西德。”
