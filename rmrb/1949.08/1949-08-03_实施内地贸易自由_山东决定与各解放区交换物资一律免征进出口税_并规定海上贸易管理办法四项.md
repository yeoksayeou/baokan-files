Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 2nd. To facilitate the exchange of goods between the liberated areas, the Shandong Provincial People's Government has decided that all trade between the liberated areas, in addition to the land trade that has already been exempted from import and export taxes, will also be exempted from import and export taxes when conducted by sea. The Provincial Government has also decided to implement the following management measures for maritime trade from August 1st:

	1. Trade between the liberated areas and between commercial ports in Shandong Province must be processed through the import and export management agencies or their affiliated institutions at each port of departure and arrival, and a formal certificate must be issued for it to be valid.

	2. For goods designated by the province as being subject to unified sales for export, free transit for export is not permitted without the approval of the foreign trade management agency, except for state-owned foreign trade companies.

	3. Foreign imported goods shipped from other liberated areas will be handled as imported goods between liberated areas if it is proven that import procedures have been completed at the port of departure in advance; otherwise, they will be handled as foreign goods imports.

	4. To prevent maritime smuggling incidents, for all goods transiting through the sea to other liberated areas, the shipping merchant must first provide a reliable guarantee and then apply to the import and export management agency for procedures. The merchant must be required to obtain proof of delivery of the goods before the guarantee can be cancelled; otherwise, it will be regarded as an export to a foreign country, and export procedures must be re-completed, and appropriate penalties will be imposed according to the severity of the circumstances.

    实施内地贸易自由
    山东决定与各解放区交换物资一律免征进出口税
    并规定海上贸易管理办法四项
    【新华社济南二日电】山东省人民政府为便利各解放区间的物资交流，特决定凡属解放区间贸易往来，除陆上往来已实行免征进出口税外，经海上往来者，亦予免征进出口税。省政府并决定于八月一日起对海上贸易往来施行下列管理办法：一、解放区间及山东本省商埠间的贸易往来，均须经过各起卸港口进出口管理机关或其所属机构，发给正式证明，始为有效。二、为本省规定统销出口的物资，除国营对外贸易公司外，非经对外贸易管理机关批准，不许自由转运出口。三、由其他解放区运来之国外进口货物，如经证明确已先行于起运口岸办理进口手续者，准照解放区间进口货物办理；否则按国外货物进口手续办理。四、为防止发生海上走私事件，凡经由海上转往其他解放区之货物，均须由经运商人事先妥具殷实保证，再行呈请进出口管理机关办理手续，并限令商人取得货物运达证明后，始可销保，否则以向国外出口论，须补办出口手续，并视情节轻重酌予处分。
