　　Shanghai Labor-Capital Relations Committee
  　Holds First Meeting
    Passes Two Provisional Measures for Handling Labor-Capital Disputes
    [Shanghai News] In order to implement the policy of "considering both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital" and to further coordinate labor-capital relations in private enterprises in the city, the Shanghai All-Circles Representatives Conference passed a resolution to organize a Labor-Capital Relations Committee. The committee held its first meeting on the 11th. Committee members Ma Chungu, Zhu Junxin, Hong Nianzu, and more than ten others attended. Vice Mayor Pan Hannian, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Sha Qianli, and economists Zhang Naiqi and Qian Jiaju were invited to attend as observers. The meeting adopted the "Shanghai Military Control Commission Provisional Measures for Mediation Procedures for Labor-Capital Disputes in Private Enterprises" and the "Shanghai Military Control Commission Provisional Measures for Handling Resumption of Business and Work Disputes." During the discussion process, representatives from both labor and capital fully demonstrated their grasp of the spirit of benefiting both labor and capital. Many opinions raised by the employee representatives took into account the actual difficulties faced by the capitalists today. However, on the other hand, they believed that the lives and professions of the working class must also be reasonably insured so that everyone can work with peace of mind and work together to build a new Shanghai for the people.
