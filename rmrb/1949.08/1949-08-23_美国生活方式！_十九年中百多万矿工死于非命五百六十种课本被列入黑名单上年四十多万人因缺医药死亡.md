　　The American Way of Life!
Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, August 22nd: TASS Moscow, 13th: The Literary Gazette published an article entitled "The American Way of Life," which stated: In June of this year, representatives of the United Mine Workers of America declared before the Senate Labor Committee that millions of miners were working under brutal conditions. In the past nineteen years, 1,259,081 people have lost their lives or been disabled due to work, which is the result of companies' irresponsibility towards mine safety equipment.
　　In agriculture, brutal exploitation methods are also practiced. Of all the workers recruited by American colonists in Western Europe and brought back to the United States to work, about 50 percent were forced to flee.
　　The "Un-American Activities Committee's" gendarmes' "movement to censor textbooks" is still continuing. Five hundred and sixty-three types of textbooks have been blacklisted as "publications with dangerous ideas." The first to be banned were textbooks that criticized the "free enterprise system" (in other words, capitalism) and criticized the so-called "freedom" of the American press. Thus, textbooks on the organization of the American Constitution commonly used in universities were banned because they contained the sentence, "The press is increasingly becoming a capitalist enterprise."
　　According to official statistics from the Labor Research Association, the number of deaths due to lack of medical care in the United States is constantly increasing. Last year, 275,000 people in the United States died from malnutrition, and 468,000 people died from lack of medical treatment. Due to the high cost of medical treatment in the United States, seeing a doctor is beyond the reach of the vast majority of people. According to materials from the New York Star, the cost of medical treatment for a common cold is almost equal to the weekly wage of an average American worker. Dean, a worker at a woodworking factory in Wyoming, has a wife and three children and needs at least $50 a week to support them, but his weekly wage is only $36. Therefore, he has to live on borrowed money. In May of this year, Dean broke his arm and not only had no money for treatment but also lost his job. He could not bear this blow and died of depression.

　　美国生活方式！
    十九年中百多万矿工死于非命五百六十种课本被列入黑名单上年四十多万人因缺医药死亡
    【新华社北平二十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：文学报载“美国生活方式”一文，其中写道：今年六月，美国矿工工会的代表在参院劳工委员会上宣称：成百万的矿工在残酷条件下工作着。在过去十九年中，因为工作而丧失生命或残废者达一百二十五万九千零八十一人，这是公司对矿井安全设备不负责任的结果。
    在农业中，残酷剥削的办法也实行着。在美国殖民者在西欧招募并带回美国做工的全部工人中，约有百分之五十被迫逃亡。
    “非美活动委员会”的宪兵们“审查教科书的运动”仍在继续进行。五百六十三种课本被列入“有危险思想的出版物”的黑名单里。首先被取缔的是批评“自由企业制度”（换句话说就是资本主义）和批评所谓美国新闻“自由”的课本。于是，大学通用的关于美国宪法组织的教科书被禁止了，因为里面有“新闻日益变成资本主义企业”的一句话。
    根据劳工研究协会的正式统计，由于缺少医药诊疗而死亡的人数，在美国不断增加着。去年，美国有二十七万五千人因营养不良而死亡，有四十六万八千人因缺乏医药治疗而死亡。由于美国医治费用昂贵，诊病是广大人民力不能及的事情。据纽约明星报的材料，普通感冒的医疗费差不多等于美国一个普通工人一星期的工资。怀俄明州一家木器工厂的工人迪安，他有一个妻子和三个孩子，每周至少需费五十元才能养活，但他每周的工资仅三十六元。因此他只得借债度日，今年五月，迪安折断了手臂，不但无钱医治，而且丧失了工作，他受不了这个打击而忧郁致死。
