Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th.

　　The divisions and clamor caused by the American White Paper within the American reactionary camp reveal that there have been two factions in American policy towards China, both in the past and the present: one faction is the Truman, Marshall, Acheson, and Stuart Group and its supporters, and the other is its opposition. The basic policies of the two factions are the same, namely aggression and interference in China, supporting Chinese reactionaries to oppose the Chinese people, but there are some differences in the specific steps and methods for realizing this policy.

　　The opposition faction within the State Department accuses the State Department's policy of insufficient effort in supporting the Chinese reactionaries. Their central argument is: Chiang Kai-shek was right, the American government was wrong, and now the White Paper should not be published, but active military action should be taken to continue assisting Chiang Kai-shek. For example, Republican Senator Bridges said: "The White Paper is mainly an attempt to defend the State Department's mistakes. The government would rather lose a continent than lose face. The Chinese war was obviously defeated in Washington, not in China." Bridges believes that the current task of the American government should be to praise and assist the Nationalist government, not to insult it. Democratic Senator McClellan said: The perilous situation in China is the result of the State Department's foreign policy.

　　During the House of Representatives' debate on the Military Aid to Foreign Countries Bill on August 17th, three congressmen, Judd, Vorys, and Lodge, jointly proposed an amendment, fiercely criticizing the American government's policy of providing "too much too fast" aid to Europe and "too little too slow" aid to Chiang Kai-shek, demanding that a sum of 200 million US dollars be used in the military aid to foreign countries appropriation to continue supporting the Kuomintang remnants in their operations. After this amendment was rejected by the majority party in the House of Representatives on the 18th, four opposition senators—Republicans Bridges, Wherry, Nolan, and Democrat McCarran—jointly issued a statement on the 21st, denouncing the White Paper as a shameful whitewash of the State Department's policy, demanding immediate and full assistance to the Nationalist government.

　　These reactionaries declared: The American government's misstep was not giving Chiang Kai-shek more assistance and not participating in the Chinese civil war on a larger and more direct scale. Pauline, the editor of the New York Christian Herald, said: "If we had listened to Wedemeyer's report two years ago and hadn't suppressed it, the Communists would not have been able to occupy Shanghai." These naive daydreamers pretended not to know that most of the American government's plans in Wedemeyer's report regarding aid to the Kuomintang reactionaries had actually been implemented. Acheson admitted in his letter to Truman that the Kuomintang army "did not suffer a single defeat in the decisive year of 1948 due to a lack of armaments and ammunition." The only thing the American government did not do in aiding the Kuomintang opposition was to fight on a large scale and directly. This was not because American imperialism was unwilling to do so. Acheson had said this was "captivating," but the outwardly strong but inwardly weak American imperialism could not do so. It saw that if it did so, it would inevitably be directly defeated under the opposition of the Chinese and American people. Acheson avoided mentioning the prospect of defeat, only saying: "Full-scale intervention would require spending more money, even more than the money that has been ineffectively spent so far, requiring American officers to command the National Government's army, and possibly involving American armed forces—land, sea, and air forces—in participation. The resulting war would be an intervention of such scope and breadth that it would arouse the resentment of the Chinese people and be condemned by the American people."

　　Regarding this point, American military adventure agitators are obviously more foolish than the Truman, Marshall, Acheson, and Stuart types. Mitchell, the spokesperson for the American oil trust, revealed the arrogant plans of these adventurers. He listed the key points for assisting the Nationalist government with "sufficient control guarantees": (1) Organize a "Volunteer Flying Tigers" team, plus American-funded and equipped army and air force equipment; (2) Provide gold or silver subsidies directly to individual Kuomintang soldiers, or have American personnel strictly supervise their use; (3) Control the Kuomintang's arsenals and industries through "involved" American advisors; (4) Widely disseminate propaganda smearing the Soviet Union and Communism; (5) Organize an American "Volunteer Mosquito Fleet," plus army and equipment from the maritime transport team, to participate in the Chinese civil war.

　　The supporters of the American State Department's policy do not agree with these adventurous plans. They are more aware of the fragility of the Chiang Kai-shek group and the United States itself. An Associated Press New York dispatch on the 6th reflected the sentiments of these people. The dispatch said: The "only possible solution" to the China problem "seems to be to take military action on a certain scale. The world's non-communist forces are completely unprepared for military action of this scale, and military action of this scale would almost certainly trigger a Third World War that everyone would fearfully avoid."

　　Although the statement that imperialist countries are unprepared for war is a lie, it is a fact that a considerable portion of the imperialist camp fears that immediately launching a war will destroy themselves. They agree with Acheson's statement, which shows that American imperialists have not given up their plan to stage a comeback in China. Senate Military Committee Chairman Tydings believes that the White Paper is "aimed at reality and is heading in the right direction." Democratic Senator Johnson said that the American government can still "find a way out of the current predicament" through the method of supporting "democratic individualism" mentioned by Acheson, and through the use of fifth columns. He believes that interfering in the Chinese civil war on a larger and more direct scale is "an indescribably reckless action. The situation in China is so difficult, so complex and intricate, that it would be extremely foolish for us to resolve it at this stage." That is to say, the supporters of the American State Department do not fundamentally oppose large-scale direct intervention, but only feel that doing so "at this stage" is too "reckless" and too "foolish."

　　The New York Herald Tribune, the Louisville Courier-Journal, the Washington Star, and the Atlanta Constitution generally support the above views. On the one hand, they admit that the White Paper "is a report full of disappointment, misery, and sorrow," and that "the victory of the Communists in China has brought some gloomy atmosphere to the West," agreeing with Acheson's confession that the "consequences of the civil war" in China "are not something the United States can control"; on the other hand, they are full of malice and preparing to stage a comeback. The New York Herald Tribune said: "If we have reached a historical turning point, then only long-term decisions on China and the entire East can be effective. Small expedients are necessary, but in themselves, they are useless. ... We need 'new perspectives,' and this must be broad, profound, and thoughtful."

　　What kind of "long-term decisions" are these? According to an Agence France-Presse Washington dispatch on the 6th, the "decisions" are: "(1) Resist any 'threat of aggression' by Communist China against its neighboring countries of Burma and India; (2) Encourage a policy among China's neighboring countries, from Korea to India, including Japan and the Philippines, which aims to weaken Communist activities within each country; (3) Make every effort to weaken the position of the Communist Party in China. Specifically, the United States intends to encourage and possibly support any movement by the Chinese people to get rid of the Communist Party to 'restore national independence.'" That is to say, American imperialism will intensify its aggression against the people of Korea to India, will further interfere in the internal affairs of these countries, and will try its best to undermine the new China from within and deprive China of its independence.

　　The supporters of the American State Department are full of confidence in this "decision," calling it a "new perspective," a "sign of the beginning of a new stage"...... On this point, Tydings, Johnson, the New York Herald Tribune, and others, as well as Truman, Marshall, Stuart, Acheson, and others they support, are more foolish than McCarran, Bridges, Judd, and others who oppose them. McCarran said: "If we continue to implement the policies mentioned in the White Paper, then soon all of Asia will fall under the control of the Communist Party." Yes, no matter what policies American imperialism adopts, Asia will never be the Asia of American imperialism, but the Asia of the people.

### 美国反动阵营对白皮书的喧哗

　　美国反动阵营对白皮书的喧哗
    美国白皮书在美国反动阵营中所引起的分歧和喧哗，显示美国对华政策过去和现在都存在着两个派别：一派是杜鲁门、马歇尔、艾奇逊、司徒雷登集团及其拥护者，另一派则是其反对者。两派的基本方针是相同的，即侵略和干涉中国，支持中国反动派别以反对中国人民，但在实现这个方针的具体步骤与方法上，两派存在着若干分歧。
    国务院反对派责备国务院政策对于支持中国反动派的努力不足。他们的中心论点是：蒋介石是对的，美国政府是错了，现在不应当发表白皮书，而应当以积极的军事行动来继续援助蒋介石。例如共和党参议员勃里奇就说：“白皮书主要是企图辩护国务院的错误。政府宁愿失去一个大陆，而不愿失去一点面子。中国战争显然是在华盛顿而不是在中国打败的。”勃里奇认为，美国政府现在的任务，应是颂扬和援助国民党政府，而不应加以侮辱。民主党参议员麦克伦说：中国的险恶局面是国务院外交政策的结果。
    在众院八月十七日辩论军事援外法案时，周以德、伏利斯、洛奇等三个众议员即联名提出一个修正案，猛烈抨击美国政府援欧“太多太快”和援蒋“太少太慢”的政策，要求在军事援外拨款中以两亿美元的数目，继续支援国民党残匪作战。在这个修正案于十八日被众院多数派否决之后，反对派的四个参议员——共和党的勃里奇、惠利、诺兰和民主党的麦卡伦又于二十一日联名发表声明，斥责白皮书是国务院的政策的可耻粉饰，要求立即给国民党政府以充分的援助。
    这些反动分子宣称：美国政府的失策是没有给蒋介石以更多的援助，没有更大规模地更直接地参加中国内战。纽约基督教先驱报主笔保林说：“如果我们两年前听从了魏德迈的报告，没有把它压下去，共产党就占领不了上海。”这些天真的空谈家们装作不知道：美国政府对魏德迈报告中关于援助国民党反动派计划的大部分其实都已经实行了。艾奇逊在其致杜鲁门的信中即承认，国民党军队“在具有决定性的一九四八年内，没有一次战役的失败是由于缺乏武装弹药”。美国政府对国民党反对派的援助，唯一没有做的就是大规模地、直接地作战。这并非美帝国主义不愿意这样做，艾奇逊曾说过这是“吸人心目”的，但是，外强中干的美帝国主义不能这样做，它看到自己如果这样做，就必然会在中国人民和美国人民的反对之下被直接地打败。艾奇逊避免提及打败仗的前途，只是说：“全面干涉需要化费更多的金钱，甚至比迄今为止无效果地用去的钱还要多，需要由美国军官指挥国民政府军队，并可能由美国武装部队——陆海空军——参加，因而发生的战争是如此范围和广度的干涉，势将引起中国民众的愤慨，并将受到美国人民的谴责。”
    对于这点，美国军事冒险的煽动家们显然比杜鲁门、马歇尔、艾奇逊、司徒雷登之流愚蠢得多。美国石油托辣斯的代言人米契尔透露了这些冒险分子的狂妄计划，他列举了援助有“足够的控制保证”的国民党政府的要点：（一）组织“志愿飞虎队”，加上美国资助和装备的军队与空军装备；（二）以黄金或白银补助金，直接给国民党军人个人，或由美国人员严格监督使用；（三）通过“当事的”美国顾问来控制国民党的兵工厂和工业；（四）广泛散播污蔑苏联和共产主义的宣传；（五）组织美国“志愿蚊式舰队”，加上海上运输队的军队和装备，参加中国内战。
    对于这些冒险计划，美国国务院政策的拥护者不以为然。他们比较了解蒋介石集团和美国本身的脆弱性。美联社纽约六日电讯反映了这些人的情绪。该电讯说：中国问题“唯一可能的解决办法，似乎只有在一种规模上采取军事行动。对于这样规模的军事行动，世界非共产主义的力量都是完全没有准备的，而且这种规模的军事行动差不多一定会引起每个人都会恐惧地躲开的第三次世界大战。”
    这里所说的帝国主义国家没有准备战争虽然是谎言，但是帝国主义阵营中相当大的一部分人惧怕立即发动战争会毁灭他们自己却是事实。他们赞成艾奇逊的声明，这个声明表明美帝国主义者对中国并没有放弃卷土重来的计划。参院军事委员会主席泰丁斯认为白皮书“针对现实，方向正确”。民主党参议员约翰逊表示，美国政府经过艾奇逊所说的支持“民主个人主义”的办法，经过利用第五纵队的办法，仍能“从目前困境中找到出路”。他认为更大规模地更直接地干涉中国内战，“为无法形容的轻率行动。中国局势如此困难，如此复杂错综，如果我们在这个阶段中加以解决，将是极为愚昧的事”。这就是说，美国国务院的支持者们，并不是根本反对大规模的直接干涉，只是觉得“在这个阶段中”这样做是太“轻率”，太“愚昧”而已。
    纽约先驱论坛报、路易斯维尔邮报、华盛顿明星报、大西洋宪章报等大体上都支持上述的见解。它们一方面承认白皮书“是一篇充满失望、悲惨与忧伤的报告”，“共产党在中国的胜利给西方带来了一些黯淡的气氛”，同意艾奇逊关于中国“内战的后果不是美国所能控制”的招供；另一方面，它们又满心恶毒地准备卷土重来。纽约先驱论坛报说：“如果我们已经到达了一个历史转折点的话，那么，只有对华和对整个东方的很长远的决策才能奏效，小的权宜之计或属必要，但就其本身来说，是无用的。……我们需要‘新的瞻望’，而这必须是一个很广泛、很深刻和有思想的。”
    这是一个怎么样的“长远的决策”呢？据法新社华盛顿六日电讯，“决策”就是：“（一）抵抗中国共产党对其邻国缅甸、印度的任何‘侵略威胁’；（二）在中国邻国中，从朝鲜至印度，其中包括日本与菲律宾，鼓励一种政策，这种政策的目的在于削弱各国内的共产党活动；（三）尽量利用机会削弱共产党在中国的地位，具体地说，美国打算鼓励并可能支持中国人摆脱共产党以‘恢复国家独立’的任何运动。”这就是说，美帝国主义将加紧对朝鲜至印度各国人民的侵略，将进一步干涉这些国家的内政，将竭力从内部来破坏人民的新中国和剥夺中国的独立。
    美国国务院的支持者对这种“决策”满怀信心，称之为“新的瞻望”、“新阶段开始的标志”…………在这一点上，泰丁斯、约翰逊、纽约先驱论坛报等，以及他们所支持的杜鲁门、马歇尔、司徒雷登、艾奇逊之流，却比反对他们的麦卡伦、勃里奇、周以德等要愚蠢些。麦卡伦说：“如果我们继续实行白皮书中所说的政策，那不久亚洲就都会落入共产党控制之下。”是的，不管美帝国主义采取什么政策，亚洲决不是美帝国主义的亚洲，而是人民的亚洲。
