Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th: The Chinese Communist Party Nanjing Municipal Committee convened a meeting of党员cadres on the 2nd and 3rd to mobilize for streamlining and thrift.粟裕,唐亮 of the CPC Municipal Committee,李达, Chief of Staff of the Second Field Army, and柯庆施, Deputy Mayor, all attended and spoke. 粟裕 pointed out in his speech: It is wrong if we only see victory and ignore the new difficulties; exaggerating the difficulties is also wrong. The current financial difficulties can be overcome. He called for: the troops to continue their advance, eliminate the remaining enemies, and liberate all of China; strengthen rural work, mobilize the masses, and eliminate bandits and special agents; and implement streamlining and thrift, inventory materials, and mobilize cadres to go to the countryside to work and participate in production. Chief of Staff李达, in a spirit of self-criticism, reviewed some wasteful phenomena existing in the organs of various units of the People's Liberation Army Second Field Army. He said: "The more responsible the leading organs are, the more carefully they must calculate. If they do not consider carefully, a nod or a word will often cause great waste. We must oppose this bureaucratic style." He called on all units of the Second Field Army to continue to maintain their consistent style of hard work and simplicity, and complete new tasks.

    【新华社南京十日电】中国共产党南京市委会于二日、三日两日召开党员干部大会，动员精简节约。中共市委会粟裕、唐亮、第二野战军参谋长李达和副市长柯庆施都出席讲话。粟裕在讲话中指出：如果我们只看到胜利而漠视新的困难，这是不对的，夸大困难也是不对的。目前财经上的困难是可以克服的。他号召：部队继续进军，肃清残余敌人，解放全中国；加强农村工作，发动群众，肃清匪特；和实行精简节约，清查物资，动员干部下乡工作和参加生产。李达参谋长则以自我批评的精神，检讨了人民解放军第二野战军各单位机关中存在着的若干浪费现象。他说：“愈是领导机关的负责人，愈要细密计算。如不慎重考虑，往往一点头、一句话就会造成莫大的浪费。我们要反对这种官僚主义作风。”他号召第二野战军各部队要继续保持历来坚苦朴素的作风，完成新的任务。
