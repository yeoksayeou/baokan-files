    [Reported by this newspaper] Agricultural production in Xingtai, Yuanshi, Neiqiu, Lincheng, Gaoyi, Zanhuang, Shahe, and seven other counties in Hebei Province has achieved significant results in the past six months by correctly implementing the policy of mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production. According to statistics, approximately 100,130 women regularly work in the fields in these seven counties, accounting for 53% of the total female labor force in the entire district. During the drought, the vast number of women actively participated in drought resistance and planting, ensuring the completion of 300,000 mu of cotton planting in the entire district. During the wheat harvest, due to the participation of 80% of women in field labor, the wheat harvest in the seven counties was completed three days ahead of schedule. With women's participation in the great production movement, the phenomenon of family discord has gradually improved, and the old habit of men and women eating different food in Xiguan, Gaoyi, has changed. Initial experiences have been gained in mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production: First, the enthusiasm of women for production should be further enhanced by solving their special interests. In the process of mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production in Mengjiazhuang, Lincheng, attention was paid to solving issues such as marriage and property rights, and education for women was also stepped up. Women have maintained a high degree of enthusiasm in various production activities in the past six months. Second, strengthen the leadership of the Party branch over women's work and criticize the views of men who despise women and women who despise labor. Third, specifically calculate production accounts and recognize the importance of mobilizing women. The Xingtai Xianyu Village branch, in formulating a four-day wheat harvest plan, made it clear that if 170 women were not mobilized to participate, 1,200 mu of wheat would not be harvested. Fourth, it is necessary to mobilize and organize women's production on a family basis, and under a unified family production plan, work with family members to complete the task of increasing family production. In some places, women's mutual aid teams are organized separately in agriculture, isolating women's production achievements. If the family asks to weed, she goes to water the land, resulting in family dissatisfaction and preventing women from participating in agricultural activities. Gaoyi and Yuanshi mobilized women to participate in various forms of small mutual aid groups with men, and Xingtai mobilized men to lead their own women to the fields, all of which achieved good results.

    邢台等七县农业生产发展
    十万妇女经常上地
    动员工作应结合妇女特殊利益
    【本报讯】河北省邢台、元氏、内邱、临城、高邑、赞皇、沙河等七县正确执行了发动妇女参加农业生产的方针，半年以来获得显著成绩。据统计：这七个县经常上地的妇女约十万零一千三百余人，占全专区妇女劳力总数的百分之五十三。在天旱不雨时，广大妇女曾积极参加了抗旱点种，保证全专区完成了种棉三十万亩。在麦收中，由于百分之八十的妇女上地劳动，七个县麦收提前三天完成，随着妇女参加大生产运动，家庭不和的现象逐渐改善，高邑西关历来男女吃两样饭的旧习惯改变了。在发动妇女参加农业生产中，获得初步经验：即：一、应结合解决妇女的特殊利益，进一步提高了妇女的生产积极性。临城孟家庄在动员妇女参加农业生产过程中，注意解决婚姻、财产权等问题，并抓紧了对妇女的教育，妇女在半年来各种生产活动中，始终保持了高度的热情。二、加强党支部对妇女工作的领导。批判男人轻视妇女及妇女们轻视劳动的观点。三、具体算生产帐，认识发动妇女的重要。邢台先玉村支部订定四天麦收计划中，明确了不发动一百七十个妇女参加，即有一千二百亩麦子割不完。四、必须以家庭为单位发动与组织妇女生产，在家庭统一生产计划下，与家人一道完成家庭增产任务。有些地方在农业上单独组织妇女互助组，将妇女生产成绩孤立起来，家庭要求锄苗，她却去浇地，结果，引起家庭不满，以致阻止妇女参加农业活动。高邑、元氏发动妇女与男人一道参加各种形式的小型互助组，邢台动员男人带领自家妇女上地，都取得很好的效果。
