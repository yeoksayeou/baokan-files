    Strictly Suppress Counter-Revolutionary Secret Societies
    Northeast Cracks Many Espionage Sabotage Cases
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th] Facts recently discovered in various parts of Northeast China prove that Kuomintang (KMT) secret service agencies are widely using local feudal superstitious secret society organizations to carry out various sabotage activities in the liberated areas, especially armed disturbances. Recently, local public security organs have successively detected and cracked more than ten such cases, including the KMT Central Statistics Bureau (Zhongtong) Shenyang Religious Work Group and Liaoyang Religious Work Team, disguised as the Great Harmony Buddhist Church, the Gaiping Cihang Buddhist Church, Yiguandao in Jianxi and Yingkou, Rehe, and the Chinese Orthodox Church in Tonghua and other places. These reactionary organizations all use feudal superstition as a disguise, but are actually carrying out counter-revolutionary activities under the control of KMT secret agents. The Religious Work Group established within the Liaoning Provincial General Association of the Great Harmony Buddhist Church in Shenyang was personally arranged by Zhu Han, the "Northeast District Director of the Zhongtong Bureau," and the group leader, Yin Fuqing, was a Zhongtong Design Committee member and an executive committee member of the KMT Shenyang City Party Department's Hunhe District. He and his group members, Wang Shikui and others, were ostensibly directors or standing directors of the Shenyang Great Harmony Buddhist Church. The Liaoyang Religious Work Team they established was led by Han Lifu and its members Li Weiyi and Yang Yuyin were all Zhongtong secret agents. The Gaiping Cihang Buddhist Church was also controlled by KMT secret agents. Its chairman, Liu Yanhang, and chairman of the board, Guo Chongguang, were secretaries of the "Changbai News Agency," a special northeast group of the "Confidential Bureau" of the pseudo-Ministry of National Defense. Under the guise of explaining the "true meaning of Buddhism," they secretly instilled reactionary education and called on young members to join the so-called "Religious National Salvation Army." The "Yiguandao," "Red Spear Society," and other feudal superstitious organizations in Jianxi, Rehe, under the control of several secret agents, including Liu Wendou, secretary of the KMT Jianxi County Party Department, and Song Kongzhang, a standing committee member, attempted to stage a riot in more than 70 villages in the border area between Jianxi and Ningcheng counties in April this year, but were detected and cracked beforehand. The reactionary leaders of these feudal superstitious groups usually fabricated rumors, extorted money from the people, seduced women, disrupted production, and sabotaged transportation, committing all kinds of evil.

    The Northeast Daily published an editorial a few days ago, pointing out that manipulating and using secret agent-controlled feudal secret societies to carry out various sabotage activities has become one of the main methods of the KMT secret agent bandit gangs today. They use landlords and rich peasants who have been struggled against in the land reform, as well as hooligans and bandits, as the pillars of the feudal secret societies, and use the superstitious psychology of the masses to deceive everyone into joining. Judging from the organization and activities of these feudal secret societies, they have become counter-revolutionary tools for KMT secret service agencies to sabotage the people's cause, and are no longer religious organizations. As long as ordinary religious organizations do not violate the laws and decrees of the People's Government and do not engage in activities that endanger the people's cause, the People's Government allows them to exist and allows freedom of religious belief. However, no matter what kind of religious organization, if it is used by imperialist and KMT secret service agents, or engages in espionage and sabotage activities under the guise of religion, the People's Government must strictly ban and punish it in order to protect the safety and interests of the people. The editorial went on to elaborate on the People's Government's policy of dealing with these reactionary feudal secret societies, saying: "The People's Government must impose legal sanctions on those secret society leaders who are willing to act as running dogs for American imperialism and KMT secret service bandit gangs and the important elements who collude with KMT secret service agents, according to their crimes. For the vast majority of the people who have been deceived and hoodwinked into joining the secret societies, they should be educated to recognize the political face of these reactionary feudal secret societies, withdraw from the secret society organizations, and the government may not investigate the past and grant them lenient treatment." The editorial finally called on all the people in Northeast China to be vigilant, strictly prevent KMT secret agents from using feudal secret societies to make trouble, defend production and construction, and maintain revolutionary order.

    严厉取缔反动会门活动
    东北破获特务破坏事件多起
    【新华社沈阳六日电】东北各地最近发现的事实证明，国民党特务机关正广泛利用各地封建迷信会门组织，在解放区进行种种破坏活动，特别是进行武装捣乱。最近地方公安机关先后侦悉破获的此类事件已有十余起，其中包括以大同佛教会为掩护的国民党中统局沈阳宗教工作组和辽阳宗教工作小组、盖平慈航佛教会、热河建西及营口等地之一贯道、通化等地之中国正教等。这些反动组织都是以封建迷信的形式做伪装，而实际上是在国民党特务操纵之下进行反革命活动。在沈阳的大同佛教会辽宁蒋匪省总会内所设立的宗教工作组，乃系蒋匪“中统局东北区区长”朱瀚所亲手布置，组长殷辅卿是中统设计委员兼国民党沈阳市党部浑河区执委，他和他所属的组员王世奎等表面上都是沈阳大同佛教会的理事或常务理事。他们一手建立的辽阳宗教工作小组，其组长韩立夫、组员李唯一、杨玉印等都是中统特务。盖平慈航佛教会亦为国民党特务所把持，其总会长为国民党特务刘沿航、理事长郭重光都是伪国防部“保密局”东北特别组“长白通讯社”的秘书。他们以讲解“佛教真谛”为名，秘密灌注反动教育，并号召青年会员参加所谓“宗教戡乱救国军”。热河建西的“一贯道”、“红枪会”等封建迷信组织，在国民党建西县党部书记长刘文斗、常务委员宋孔章等数名特务分子的操纵下，今年四月间企图在建西、宁城两县交界地区之七十余村庄举行暴动，事前即被发觉破获。这些封建迷信团体的反动首领平时捏造谣言，勒索民财，诱奸妇女，破坏生产，破坏交通，无恶不作。
    东北日报于日前发表社论，指出：操纵和利用特务封建会门进行各种破坏，已成为今天国民党特务匪帮活动的主要方式之一。他们以在土地改革中被斗争过的地主、富农、以及流氓土匪作封建会门的台柱，利用群众的迷信心理，欺骗大家入伙。从这些封建会门的组织和活动看来，它们已成为国民党特务机关借以破坏人民事业的反革命工具，早已不是什么宗教团体了。通常的宗教团体，只要他们不违反人民政府的法令，不做危害人民事业的勾当，人民政府是允许他们存在，并允许信教自由的。但无论那一种宗教团体，如果为帝国主义及国民党特务分子所利用，或以宗教面目进行特务破坏活动，人民政府为了保障人民的安全和利益，一定要予以严厉取缔和制裁。社论继阐述人民政府处理这些反动的封建会门的方针称：对于那些甘心给美帝国主义和国民党特务匪帮充当走狗的罪大恶极的会门头子和与国民党特务分子相勾结的重要分子，人民政府一定要根据他们的罪恶，给以法律制裁。而对于绝大多数被欺骗、被蒙蔽加入会门的老百姓，则应对他们进行教育，使他们认清这些反动封建会门的政治面目，退出会门组织，政府可以不究既往，予以宽大待遇。社论最后号召全东北人民都应该警惕起来，严防国民党特务利用封建会门捣乱，保卫生产建设，维护革命秩序。
