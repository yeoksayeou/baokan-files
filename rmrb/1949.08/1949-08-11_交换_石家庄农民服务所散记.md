Exchange
Notes from the Shijiazhuang Farmers' Service Center

　　The wheat harvest is in. Farmers entering the city are bringing the fruits of their hard labor—wheat—to the Farmers' Service Center, requesting to exchange it for coarse grains, coal, salt, and other necessities.

　　In the spring, the Farmers' Service Center received over ten thousand farmers, providing food and lodging, and resolving difficulties encountered in the city. The Service Center has established a solid reputation in the minds of the farmers, so when the grain was harvested, the farmers naturally brought it to the Service Center.

　　The farmers waited with great anticipation for the wheat harvest, and this year's harvest was not bad. When they bring their wheat into the Service Center, they shout from afar as if announcing good news: "The wheat is here!" The staff warmly welcomes them. The villagers boast to the staff about how well their wheat grew and how cleanly it was harvested. After asking what the Service Center has to exchange, one says: "I want to exchange for some millet to cook porridge in the summer." Another says: "I want to exchange for some sorghum to save." Others say: "I want to exchange for some salt and coal." All of the farmers' expenses depend on the harvests of the summer and autumn seasons. Farmers are accustomed to saving, exchanging wheat for coarse grains in order to obtain more grain.

　　Since its establishment, this is the first time the Farmers' Service Center has encountered the harvest season for agricultural products. Due to lack of experience, they did not sufficiently understand the farmers' needs beforehand, and the preparations were not adequate. The Service Center had tens of thousands of pounds of coarse grains in storage, but they were exchanged within three days. The staff allocated their own rice, ten or twenty pounds at a time, to the villagers. Although this did not satisfy the villagers' requests, the villagers knew that this was the rice eaten by the Service Center, which made them feel even closer. They praised the Service Center's good spirit and also criticized the Service Center for not having a good plan.

　　Then, the Service Center began to exchange large quantities of wheat for coarse grains on behalf of the trading company. In the first two days, the exchange ratio was not entirely appropriate, which once caused dissatisfaction among the farmers, but it was quickly corrected. The exchange has been going smoothly ever since.

　　Nearly a thousand farmers enter and leave the Farmers' Service Center like a flowing stream every day. The farmers want to exchange for a little of everything from the Service Center's stocks of coarse grains, salt, coal, etc. The Service Center has not yet prepared the farm tools and daily necessities that the farmers also need. This is an experience, and in the future, it will be necessary to take care of the farmers' needs with more industrial products.

　　Farmers prefer simplicity in exchange and like barter. At that time, wheat was priced at 43 yuan per pound, and millet was priced at 42 yuan per pound. In reality, wheat was one yuan higher than millet. Cadres believed that calculating the accounts clearly would make it clear to the villagers. However, on the contrary, the honest and sincere villagers felt that this was a bit "distant." They said: "Wheat has a wheat price, and rice has a rice price. Is the Service Center doing business?" This is a principle that can only be explained in psychology. The Service Center finally accepted this experience, only telling the villagers the exchange difference, without mentioning the market price, to reduce the difficulty of repeated calculations.

　　There are often lines of hundreds of farmers waiting to exchange at the Service Center. Although the Service Center has two branches and a coal yard, they all seem small, and the staff is too busy. Sometimes, the villagers have to wait all day. However, the villagers do not complain. They see that the staff cannot even find time to eat; moreover, the weighing is accurate, and they consult with the villagers when removing the husks. If individual farmers who are new to the Service Center are not at ease with the weighing, they weigh it for them again, without putting on airs, and with a friendly attitude, making the farmers feel close to the Service Center. In the midst of the busy schedule, if individual villagers are not at ease with the Service Center, other farmers will explain from the side: "It won't be wrong, this is the Service Center, it's not like outside, don't worry." Many farmers help carry things, and frequent visitors greet new visitors, improving work efficiency.

　　The farmers cherish the wheat they have harvested with their own hands. Villagers often advise the comrades at the Service Center, saying: "My wheat is good, keep it for our Service Center to eat." Indeed, most of the wheat brought to the Service Center is not bad. This is because they have been treated by the Service Center in the past, and the Service Center has solved their difficulties in the spring famine. They feel uneasy that there has only been giving and no receiving. Now, from their expressions, it can be seen that they seem to be bringing good grain to repay the Service Center.

　　There are also individual farmers who are unaware and mix soil in their wheat. After being discovered by the staff, many farmers criticized him in unison, saying that he was letting people down. A villager who mixed soil regretted under the criticism of the masses and said: "I said don't mix it, but my family wanted to mix it, how can I face people!" The staff comforted him and said: "Just don't do it next time." They advised him not to worry.

　　After the wheat harvest, the farmers' lives have improved. Many villagers bring white flour dry rations, and everyone only drinks water at the Service Center. The kitchen has to boil dozens of large pots of boiling water every day, and if there is time, they also cook mung bean soup, which makes the farmers feel even more cordial and convenient.

　　Some farmers who are not too busy at home ask where the park is after the exchange, and they want to go out and have fun. They confidently deposit their belongings at the Service Center and go to visit the park and stroll the streets in twos and threes; the farmers who stay overnight ask the staff to tell them which theater has good shows, and they want to go to see the show; the farmers' lives are better, and they need to relax.

　　In this exchange, the reputation of the Farmers' Service Center is even higher. Farmers who are new to the city ask for the address of the Service Center on the street. A villager could not find the place and wandered around the street all morning. Finally, in a hurry, he spent ten yuan to hire a guide to take him to the Service Center. This also shows that the Service Center needs to set up one or two more branches on the main traffic routes for farmers entering the city.

　　Seeing that the autumn harvest is approaching, the staff of the Service Center should make preparations as soon as possible. When the time comes, the autumn harvest will be even busier than the wheat harvest.

    交换
    石家庄农民服务所散记
    麦收了。进城的农民都拿着自己辛苦得来的果实——麦子，走进农民服务所，要求把麦子换成杂粮、煤炭、食盐和其他用具。
    农民服务所在春天曾经接待过上万的农民，招待食宿，解决进城困难，服务所在农民的心目中已有了巩固的威信，到粮食下来时农民自动地拿到服务所，这完全是自然的。
    农民好容易等到麦收了，而且今年收的不算坏。当他们拿着麦子走进服务所时，总象报喜一样远远地就叫着：“麦子来了！”工作同志热心地迎接他们。老乡都向工作同志夸耀自己麦子打的好，收拾得干净，他们问了服务所都有什么可以交换的后，这个说：“我要换点小米回去夏天熬稀饭。”那个说：“我要换点高粮回去节约。”也有的说：“我要换点盐、煤炭。”农民的一切开支全靠夏秋两季的收获。农民惯于节约，打下麦子换杂粮，为的是多得一点粮食。
    农民服务所成立以来，这是第一次遇到农产品收获的季节，因为没有经验，对农民要换的东西事前了解不够，准备的颇不充分。服务所存着几万斤杂粮，不到三天就换完了，工作人员把自己吃的米都十斤二十斤的分配给老乡，这虽没有满足老乡要求，老乡知道这是服务所吃的米，便更觉亲切，一面赞扬服务所的精神好，一面也责备服务所没有很好的计划。
    接着服务所开始代贸易公司用杂粮大量交换麦子，在头两天定的交换比例不够十分怡当，曾一度引起农民不满，但很快的纠正了。交换就一直顺利下去。
    每天近千的农民象流水一样出入农民服务所，服务所所有的杂粮、食盐、煤炭等，农民每样都要换一点；农民还需要的农具、日用品，服务所都未及筹备。这是一个经验，以后需要根据农民的需要从更多的工业品方面来照顾农民。
    农民在交换中需要简单，欢喜物物交换。当时麦子每斤作价四十三元，小米每斤作价四十二元，实际上麦子高于小米一元。干部认为这样明白地算帐会使老乡弄得清楚。可是恰恰相反，老乡们老实与忠厚的觉得这样有些“外气”，他们说：“麦作麦价，米作米价，服务所又不是做生意了？”这是在心理学上才能讲通的道理。服务所终于接受这一经验，只告诉老乡交换差额，不提市价，以减少反复计算的困难。
    在服务所等待交换的农民时常都有上百人的行列，服务所虽有两个分所一个煤厂，但都显得地方小，工作同志忙不过来，有时要使老乡等一天。但老乡并不埋怨，他们眼看着工作同志连吃饭的工夫都抽不出来；而且秤秤的准确，除皮时和老乡商量，如有个别新到服务所的农民对秤不放心时，就给他多秤一道，不摆架子，态度和气，使农民对服务所都觉得亲切。在百忙中遇有个别老乡对服务所不放心时，便有农民从旁解释说：“不会错的，这是服务所，不比外面，放心好了。”许多农民帮助搬运东西，常来的招呼新来的，使工作效率得以提高。
    农民对于自己亲手打下的麦子，都非常珍惜，常有老乡劝服务所的同志说：“我这麦子好，留到咱服务所自己吃吧。”的确，拿到服务所的麦子大部都不坏，这是平常他们受到服务所的招待，服务所又曾经解决他们在春荒中的困难，过去有往无来，使他们觉得不安。现在从他们表情里可以看出好象是要拿好粮食来酬答服务所似的。
    也有个别农民不自觉，在麦子里掺了土，经工作同志发觉后，许多农民都同声的批评他，说他对不起人。一个掺土的老乡在群众指责下后悔地说：“我说不要掺，家里人要掺，这叫我怎见人呀！”工作同志安慰他说：“下次不要这样就行了。”劝他不要着急。
    麦收后，农民的生活都改善了，很多老乡都带着白面干粮，大家只在服务所喝点水。厨房每天要烧到几十大锅开水，来得及还熬点绿豆汤，这使农民更感亲切与方便。
    有些家里不太忙的农民，交换后，便打听公园在什么地方，他们要出去玩玩。他们放心地把东西寄到服务所，三三两两地去游公园逛大街；晚上住下的农民要工作同志说给他那个戏院的戏好，他们要去看戏；农民的生活比较好了，他们需要轻松一下。
    在这次交换中，农民服务所的声誉更高了。初进城的农民满街打听服务所的地址。有个老乡找不着地方，在街上转了一个上午，最后急了，花了十块钱雇了一个带路的带到服务所。这里也说明服务所还需要在农民进城的交通要道上再设一两个分所。
    眼看秋收快到了，服务所的工作同志们应当及早做好准备工作。到时候，秋收会比麦收更忙。
