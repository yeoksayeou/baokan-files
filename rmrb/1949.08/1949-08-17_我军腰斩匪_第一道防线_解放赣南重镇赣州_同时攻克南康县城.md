　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 16th: The People's Liberation Army liberated Ganzhou, an important town in southern Jiangxi Province, on the 14th, and captured Nankang County, southwest of Ganzhou. Ganzhou is the economic, cultural, and industrial center of southern Jiangxi Province, with a population of approximately 60,000. Bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek once sent his son Chiang Ching-kuo to be stationed here to suppress and brutalize the people of southern Jiangxi, who have a revolutionary tradition. Since the Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River and entered the Hunan-Jiangxi area, the bandit Ministry of National Defense has妄想 attempted to establish a so-called "first line of defense" from Hengyang through Ganzhou to Fuzhou. Now that Ganzhou has been liberated, it once again proves that any resistance by the Kuomintang bandit army cannot stop the rapid advance of the Liberation Army.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 16th: The entire 337 officers and soldiers of the 1st Battalion of the 693rd Regiment of the 213th Division of the Kuomintang bandit army in southern Jiangxi, led by Battalion Commander Zhong Liwen and Deputy Battalion Commander Zeng Zhixiang, surrendered to our People's Liberation Army in Lutang, Taihe County, on the 11th, bringing with them 13 light and heavy machine guns, one rocket launcher, two 60mm mortars, 217 rifles, and a portion of ammunition.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 16th: The local troops of the Ji'an Sub-district of the People's Liberation Army in Jiangxi Province, on the 1st of this month, suppressed the bandit Security Regiment 17 which was roaming between Yongfeng and Anfu, capturing more than 120 bandits, killing and wounding more than 20, and seizing 120 long and short guns.
    In addition, the armed forces of the sub-district, from July 26 to August 10, in the newly liberated Ji'an, Xiajiang, Taihe, Yongxin, Anfu, Wan'an, Suichuan and other places, captured, killed, and reorganized more than 1,000 bandits of local reactionary armed forces, and seized more than 2,400 long and short guns.

　　我军腰斩匪“第一道防线”
    解放赣南重镇赣州
    同时攻克南康县城
    【新华社华中前线十六日电】人民解放军于十四日解放江西省南部的重镇赣州，并攻克赣州西南的南康县城。赣州是江西省南部的经济、文化、工业中心，约有六万人口。匪首蒋介石曾经派他的儿子蒋经国驻在这里镇压摧残具有革命传统的江西南部人民。自解放军横渡长江，进入湘赣境内后，匪国防部又曾妄想从衡阳经过赣州到福州，建立所谓“第一道防线”。现赣州已告解放，又一次证明了国民党匪军的任何抵抗，都阻止不了解放军的迅速前进。
    【新华社华中前线十六日电】赣南国民党匪军第二十三军二一三师六九三团第一营全体官兵三百三十七人，在该营营长钟立文副营长曾志祥率领下，十一日在泰和县芦塘地向我人民解放军投诚，携来轻重机枪十三挺，火箭筒一个，六零炮二门，步枪二一七枝，弹药一部。
    【新华社南昌十六日电】人民解放军江西省吉安分区地方部队，本月一日清剿流窜于永丰、安福之间匪保安十七团，俘匪一百二十余名，毙伤二十余名，缴长短枪一百二十枝。
    又，该分区武装，自七月二十六日至八月日十半月间，在新解放的吉安、峡江、泰和、永新、安福、万安、遂川等地共俘、毙和收编匪地方反动武装一千余名，缴长短枪二千四百余支。
