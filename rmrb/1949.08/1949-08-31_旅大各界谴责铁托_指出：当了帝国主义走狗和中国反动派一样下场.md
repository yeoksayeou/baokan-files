　　Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 30th. People from all walks of life in Lüda unanimously support the Soviet government's reply to the Tito clique in Yugoslavia, and strongly condemn the Tito counter-revolutionary group's anti-Soviet conspiracy. Wang Qun, vice president of the Lüda Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, believes that the Soviet Union's reply to Yugoslavia is like a mirror exposing the reactionary fellows of the Tito ilk, making people all over the world more clearly aware of the true face of the Tito group. The Tito group has turned Yugoslavia, liberated by the Soviet army, into a fascist state, and they have become enemies of the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world. Wang Shuzhuang, chairman of the Dalian Municipal Trade Union, said: After reading the Soviet government's note to Yugoslavia, it further proves the truth of Chairman Mao's instruction that China must stand firmly with the Soviet Union. Tito betrayed the Soviet Union, and as a result, he became an imperialist lackey. As for the future end of the Titos, the demise of the Chinese reactionaries is the best example. Wu Yanan, chairman of the Lüda Democratic Women's Federation, said: For a few dollars, Tito is using Hitler's old trick to deal with the Yugoslav people; but the Yugoslav people, who bravely resisted Hitler's bandits, will surely understand how to obtain their freedom and happiness. Lüda workers and young students expressed particular indignation at Tito's persecution of Soviet citizens residing in Yugoslavia. Li Huanchang, a worker at the Dalian Locomotive Depot of the China Changchun Railway, said: We workers support the Soviet government's solemn statement. We believe that persecuting Soviet citizens is an attempt to undermine world peace. Communist Youth League member Li Peiyun said: Offering territory to imperialism and throwing Soviet friends into prison is completely bandit behavior.

　　旅大各界谴责铁托
    指出：当了帝国主义走狗和中国反动派一样下场
    【新华社大连三十日电】旅大各界人士一致拥护苏联政府对南斯拉夫铁托集团的复文，严厉谴责铁托反革命集团的反苏阴谋。旅大中苏友好协会副会长王群认为苏联对南复文，是一面透视反动家伙铁托之流的照妖镜，使全世界人民都更加清楚地认识了铁托集团的真面目。铁托集团已把由苏军解放的南斯拉夫变成了法西斯国家，他们已成了苏联与全世界爱好和平人民的敌人。大连市职工会主席王树庄说：读了苏联政府致南斯拉夫的照会，更加证明了毛主席所指示的中国必须和苏联紧紧站在一起的真理。铁托背叛了苏联，结果就成了帝国主义的走狗。至于铁托们的未来下场，中国反动派的末日就是一个最好的榜样。旅大民主妇女联合会主席吴亚南说：铁托为了几块美元，正在袭用希特勒的故技对付南国人民；但英勇抗击过希特勒匪徒的南国人民，一定会懂得怎样取得自己的自由幸福。旅大工人和青年学生，对于铁托迫害侨居南国的苏联公民，表示特别义愤。中长铁路大连机务段工人李焕昌说：我们工人拥护苏联政府的严正声明。我们认为迫害苏联公民，就是企图破坏世界和平。青年团员李佩云说：把领土奉送帝国主义，把苏联朋友投进监狱，这完全是强盗行为。
