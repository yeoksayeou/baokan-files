    Changjiang Daily Calls for Valiant Advance
    Eliminate the Chiang-Bai Remnants in Central China.
    The Front should Encourage Soldiers to Complete Final Advance Preparations; The Rear should Purge Hidden Bandits and Special Agents and Consolidate Security.
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] Hankou Electric: The Central China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party's organ, Changjiang Daily, published an editorial titled "Advance Valiantly, Eliminate the Remaining Enemies in Central China!" to commemorate the "August 1st" Army Day. It began by stating: "Twenty-two years ago today, due to the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the revolution, the Chinese Communists continued to shoulder the task of completing the Chinese people's democratic revolution and, led by Commander-in-Chief Zhu, General He Long, and the late General Ye Ting, launched the great Nanchang Uprising, thereby establishing the Chinese people's own army." It continued by pointing out: "Our People's Liberation Army Fourth Field Army, like other fraternal field armies, is inseparable from the glorious history of the Nanchang Uprising. Twenty-two years ago, this army departed from Wuhan and held heroic uprisings in Nanchang, Pingliu, and the Hubei-Henan-Anhui region. For more than twenty years, our army has fought north and south, enduring hardships. Especially in the recent three years of the Liberation War, after liberating the Northeast and cooperating with fraternal units to liberate North China, today, in order to eliminate the remaining enemies in the south of the Yangtze River and liberate the people of southern China, this well-tempered million-strong army has received the advance order from Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu and is heading south from the Tianjin area, embarking on a long expedition of three thousand miles, returning to the Central China region. Our army has already achieved great victories, opened up a vast strategic base in the Central China region, and established a solid foundation for eliminating all the remaining enemies in Central China. They are worthy of the glorious tradition of the 'Nanchang Uprising.'" The editorial also stated: "Our Fourth Field Army, during its southward march, solved the problem of 40,000 remnant enemies in Anyang and Xinxiang, and removed the last two isolated strongholds of the Chiang bandits in North China. Under the powerful shock of our million-strong army's surging southward advance, the Central China bandit chieftain Bai Chongxi had no choice but to rapidly withdraw from Xinyang and flee, even rolling out of the three towns of Wuhan, the military, political, and economic center of Central China; and our army swept through the areas of Southern Henan, Northern Hubei, Central Hubei, Southern Hubei, and Northern Jiangxi, advancing the forward base of the Central China strategic zone from Henan to Hubei. Especially in the recent twenty days, our army has launched a powerful offensive on the long front from Yisha in the west to Ganjiang in the east. With the cooperation of our fraternal units, it has not only crushed the enemy's so-called 'Local Counter-Offensive Plan in Central China,' shattered its dream of attempting to rely on Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou to conduct a final desperate resistance, but also liberated the vast areas of Western Hubei, Western Hunan, Northeastern Hunan, and Northwestern Jiangxi, drove out the remaining military forces of the Chiang-Bai bandit gang, and annihilated 20,000 of them. In four months, our army has liberated the entire province of Henan, the majority of the provinces of Hubei and Jiangxi, and a part of Hunan, occupied the central cities of Wuhan, Yichang, Shashi, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Yueyang, and Changde, which are military, political, and economic centers, and controlled the most fertile rice and cotton-producing areas in Central China, as well as the coal and iron-producing areas of Daye, Anyuan, and Pingxiang, which are the industrial center of gravity of Central China; while the remnant enemy is scurrying about in the narrow areas of Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi, losing their footing, with no way out, morale is depressed, and they are about to be wiped out by us in one fell swoop." The editorial concluded by calling: "The commanders and fighters of our entire field army must boost their fighting will, eliminate complacency and underestimation of the enemy, improve combat skills, carefully study the enemy's operational characteristics, master all the tactics and techniques of southern operations, forge a high degree of physical endurance, pay attention to summer hygiene, improve the management of troops suitable for living conditions in the south, ensure that the troops are always fully staffed, maintain close ties with the masses, constantly improve the concept of policy and discipline, and quickly complete all the preparations for the final advance. The commanders and fighters of our entire local forces must consolidate the security of the rear, heighten vigilance, purge all hidden and disruptive special agents and bandits, suppress bandits, protect the work of mobilizing the masses and the construction of local power, and protect transportation well, in order to facilitate the advance of the main force to the south. A part of the field army which is ordered to transform into the local forces, should resolutely implement the Central China Bureau's policy of 'localizing the main force', and shoulder the task of 'fighting team兼working team', in order to quickly establish the work of the military region, so that the people's regime can get a realiable safeguard strength. All the underground workers and guerrillas in the to-be-liberated area of Central China must expand the armed forces, strengthen the guerrillas, and carry out the task of protecting the people's property in the to-be-liberated area; when the main force advances to the south, they should actively cooperate in combat, attack and disrupt the enemy's rear, cut off the enemy's retreat, and wipe out all the Chiang-Bai remnants in Central China. All the staff at the rear should work hard, strive to produce, restore transportation, develop transportation and trade, link urban and rural relations, open up financial sources, eliminate all corrupt and decadent ideas of peace and enjoyment, promote the traditional spirit of hard work and simple style, strictly practice streamlining and economy, strictly prohibit extravagance and waste, respond to the Central China Bureau's call for 'cadres to go to the countryside', do a good job in mobilizing the masses, and wholeheartedly support the front, everything should be for the final elimination of the Chiang-Bai bandit gang and the liberation of the whole Central China!"

    长江日报号召奋勇前进
    消灭华中蒋白残匪
    前方要鼓舞战士完成最后进军准备；后方要肃清暗藏匪特巩固治安。
    【本报讯】汉口电：中共中央华中局机关报长江日报以“奋勇前进，消灭华中残余敌人！”为题发表纪念“八一”建军节社论，首称：“二十二年前的今天，由于蒋贼介石背叛革命，中国共产党人继续担负起完成中国人民民主革命的任务，在朱总司令、贺龙将军和已故的叶挺将军率领下，举行了伟大的南昌起义，从此建立了中国人民自己的军队。”继指出：“我人民解放军第四野战军和其他兄弟野战军一样，是与南昌起义的光荣历史分不开的。二十二年以前，这支队伍是从武汉出发，在南昌、在平浏、在鄂豫皖举行英勇起义的。二十多年来我军转战南北，历尽艰辛。特别在最近三年的解放战争中，解放了东北，配合兄弟部队解放了华北以后，今天，为了肃清江南残敌，解放江南人民，这支百炼成钢的百万雄师又奉了毛主席朱总司令的进军命令，由天津地区兼程南下，跨过三千里的长远征程，重新回到了华中地区。我军，已经取得了伟大的胜利，开拓了华中地区的广大战略基地，树立了消灭华中全部残敌的稳固基础。他们是无愧于‘南昌起义’的光荣传统的。”社论又称：“我第四野战军在南下的旅次行军中，就解决了安阳、新乡的四万残敌，拔除了蒋匪在华北的最后两处孤立据点。在我百万大军汹涌南进的强大威力震撼下，华中匪首白崇禧不得不自信阳急速撤军逃窜，直至滚出华中军事、政治、经济中心的武汉三镇；而我军则席卷豫南、鄂北、鄂中、鄂南、赣北诸地区，将华中战略区的前进基地，由河南推进到了湖北。特别是最近二十天来，我军在西起宜沙东至赣江的漫长战线上，发动了强大攻势，在我兄弟部队的配合下，不仅粉碎了敌人的所谓‘华中局部反攻计划’，打破其妄图依托湘、鄂、川、黔进行最后负隅顽抗的梦想，而且解放了鄂西、湘西、湘东北、赣西北的广大地区，驱逐了蒋白匪帮的残余军事力量，并歼灭其两万之众。四个月间，我军解放了河南省全部，解放了湖北、江西两省的大部和湖南的一部，占领了武汉、宜昌、沙市、南昌、九江、岳阳、常德等军事、政治、经济的中心城市，控制了华中最富饶的产米产棉区域，和华中工业重心的大冶、安源、萍乡等煤铁产区；而残敌则窜蹙湘、赣、粤、桂的狭小地区，进退失据，走头无路，士气消沉，行将为我一举聚歼。”社论最后号召：“我全体野战军的指战员们，要鼓舞战斗意志，肃清麻痹轻敌观念，提高战斗技能，细心研究敌人的作战特点，熟练南方作战的一切战术技术，炼锻体力上的高度坚忍能力，注意夏令卫生，改进适合南方生活条件的部队管理工作，保证部队的经常满员，密切联系群众，经常提高政策纪律观念，赶快完成最后进军的一切准备工作。我全体地方部队的指战员们，要巩固后方治安，提高警惕性，肃清一切潜伏捣乱的特务匪徒，剿灭土匪，掩护发动群众的工作和地方政权的建设工作，很好地保护交通，以便于大军南进。我奉命转化为地方部队的一部分野战军，则应坚决执行华中局的‘主力地方化’的方针，担负起‘战斗队兼工作队’的任务，以便迅速建立军区的工作，使人民政权得到切实可靠的护卫力量。我华中待解放区的一切地下工作者和游击队员们，要扩大武装力量，壮大游击队，在待解放区执行保护人民祖国财产的任务；在大军南进时，则应积极配合作战，袭击和扰乱敌人的后方，截断敌人的退路，把蒋白残匪全部消灭在华中境内。我后方的一切工作人员，要紧张工作，努力生产，恢复交通，发展运输贸易，沟通城乡关系，开辟财政来源，肃清一切和平享乐的腐化堕落思想，发扬传统的艰苦精神和朴素作风，厉行精简节约，严禁铺张浪费，响应华中局‘干部下乡’的号召，做好发动群众的工作，全心全力支援前线，一切应当为着最后消灭蒋白匪帮，解放全华中而努力！”
