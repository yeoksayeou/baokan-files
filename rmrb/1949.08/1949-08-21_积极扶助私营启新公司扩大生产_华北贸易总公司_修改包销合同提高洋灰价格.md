　　Actively Helping Private Qixin Company Expand Production
    North China Trading Company
  　Revises Sales Contract, Increases Cement Price
    [Our Tianjin News] To support the cement production of Qixin Company, the North China Trading Company recently revised the cement price in the sales contract according to Qixin Company's request. The original sales contract was signed on March 31st, with a term of six months, expiring at the end of September. The cement price was calculated based on the cost proposed by Qixin Company at that time. Although Qixin had no losses under this cost, it found it difficult to repair machinery, purchase parts, and expand production because production had shrunk and machinery had fallen into disrepair during the Japanese and Kuomintang rule. Therefore, Qixin Company proposed an increase in the factory price. Following the policy of supporting industry and commerce and based on the actual situation, the Trading Company decided to revise the sales contract. From May, the cement price was increased by 33.7% based on the original base, and calculated monthly according to the price index.
    After liberation, Qixin Cement Company has developed with the help of the People's Government and state-owned enterprises. At the beginning of the liberation of Tianjin, the Military Control Commission's Trading Office first purchased 2,000 tons of cement, solving the difficulty of paying wages. After signing the sales contract with the Trading Company at the end of March, the problem of product sales was solved. In addition, it also helped to solve the foreign exchange purchase of packaging paper bags. Zhou Shu＠, the manager of the company, told reporters that it was unimaginable that Qixin Company could survive after liberation without the help of the Trading Company. In the past, it was necessary to always consider the problem of product promotion, and sometimes the products could not be sold and the funds were tied up, making reproduction difficult. This difficulty has now been solved. For example, although only more than 1,600 tons of cement were sold in May and June, Qixin can still obtain loans from the Trading Company on a monthly basis, enabling the company to produce with peace of mind, improve technology, and improve quality. The increase in price this time further demonstrates the care and support of state-owned enterprises for private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. In the future, the cement sales will have very good prospects in the national construction, and Qixin Company should actively seek development with the help of state-owned enterprises.

### 积极扶助私营启新公司扩大生产  华北贸易总公司　修改包销合同提高洋灰价格

　　积极扶助私营启新公司扩大生产
    华北贸易总公司
  　修改包销合同提高洋灰价格
    【本报天津讯】华北贸易总公司为扶植启新公司洋灰生产，最近根据启新公司要求修改了包销合同中的洋灰价格。原包销合同于三月三十一日订立，期限六个月，至九月底满期，洋灰价格是按照当时启新公司提出的成本计算。按此成本启新虽无赔累，但因在日寇与国民党统治期间，生产萎缩，机器失修，故如欲修理机器，添购零件，扩大生产，就感到困难，因而启新公司提出增加厂价的要求。贸易总公司本扶植工商业的方针，并依据实际情况，决定修改包销合同，从五月份起，将洋灰价格按原底数增加百分之三十三·七，逐月随物价指数计算。
    解放后的启新洋灰公司在人民政府及国营企业帮助下获得了发展：津市解放初期，首由军管会贸易处收购洋灰二千吨，解决其发放工资的困难；三月底与贸易总公司订立包销合同后，又解决了成品销路问题。此外更帮助代为解决外汇购买包装纸袋等。该公司经理周叔＠向记者表示，解放以后启新公司如果没有贸总的帮助，是不可想象的，过去要时时顾及到产品的推销问题，有时产品推销不出去就积压了资金，使再生产发生困难。目前这种困难解决了，如五、六两月内虽仅销洋灰一千六百余吨，而启新仍能按月获得贸易总公司的贷款，使公司能够安心生产，改进技术，提高质量。这次增加价格问题上更表现了国营企业对于有益国计民生之私营企业的照顾与扶植。今后国家建设事业中，洋灰销路有极好前途，启新公司当在国营企业扶助下积极求得发展。
