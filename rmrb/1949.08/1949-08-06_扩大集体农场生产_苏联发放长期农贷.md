Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th: Moscow dispatch: The Soviet government is vigorously assisting the development of agriculture. The Soviet State Agricultural Bank is continuously increasing its five- to twelve-year long-term loans to collective farms, to be used as funds for expanding production and construction. Last year, the Agricultural Bank issued loans to collective farms equivalent to twice the amount of the previous year, and this year it will increase threefold compared to last year. In order to help implement the three-year plan for developing livestock breeding (the plan stipulates that livestock products will increase by 50 percent within three years), the Agricultural Bank has specially launched a special loan to promote the mechanization of livestock breeding. In order to help collective farms build power stations after the war, the loans issued by the Agricultural Bank account for 75 percent of the total cost of building power stations.

    扩大集体农场生产
    苏联发放长期农贷
    【新华社北平五日电】莫斯科讯：苏联政府大力帮助农业的发展。苏联国家农业银行不断增加对集体农场为期五年到十二年的长期贷款，作为集体农场扩大生产和建设的经费。去年，农业银行发给集体农场的贷款相当于前年的两倍，今年又将比去年增加三倍。农业银行为了帮助实行发展牲畜饲养三年计划（该计划规定牲畜产物在三年内增加百分之五十），特别举办了促进牲畜饲养机械化的特别贷款。为了帮助集体农场在战后建设电力站，农业银行发放的贷款占建设电力站全部经费的百分之七十五。
