　　Hui People's Representatives Convey Resolutions
    Praising the National Equality Spirit of the All-Circles Representatives Conference and Calling on All Hui People in the City to Assist the Government in Implementing the Resolutions
    [This City News] The Beiping Municipal Hui People's Work Committee convened the Beiping Municipal Hui People's Representatives Conference at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 27th) in the auditorium of the Hui People's College in Guang'anmen Nei to convey the spirit and resolutions of the Beiping Municipal All-Circles Representatives Conference. Over two hundred representatives from all sectors of the Hui community, including workers, farmers, merchants, primary and secondary school teachers, civil servants, and vendors, attended. The meeting began with Chairman Jin Yaoru explaining the significance of the meeting, followed by a report from Ma Yuhuai, Director of the Hui Committee and a representative at the All-Circles Representatives Conference. He praised the All-Circles Representatives Conference as not only a democratic and united gathering but also one that embodied the spirit of national equality. The conference included representatives from all sectors, as well as representatives from minority ethnic groups such as Mongolians, Hui, and Tibetans, truly achieving national equality. During discussions, everyone could freely express their opinions, and every proposal underwent democratic voting. There were debates during the discussions, and erroneous proposals could be rejected. There was no belittling of proposals related to minority ethnic groups; minority ethnic groups were respected and treated favorably at the conference. The entire conference discussed the most important issues facing Beiping at the time. Therefore, this conference achieved great success. He then explained the resolutions of the conference in detail, stating that he raised his hand in support on behalf of the 80,000 Hui people when many excellent resolutions were passed at the conference. In his speech, he called on the Hui people of Beiping: 1. To assist public security organs in exposing counter-revolutionary spies among both Han and Hui people, and to severely suppress those spies who continue to operate, in order to stabilize life. 2. To develop the Hui economy, engage in production that benefits the national economy and people's livelihoods, change their lifestyles and modes of production, and assist the government in eradicating profiteering merchants. 3. To vigorously develop Hui education. 4. To practice strict economy and thrift, and to disperse the urban population. Following this, Imam Yang Deliang, a representative at the conference, conveyed the spirit of the conference. He said that attending the conference had broadened his knowledge and suggested that everyone should implement the resolutions well. Next, representatives from various sectors of the Hui community spoke. Hui Dehan, a railway worker, said, "We must break through personal considerations, eliminate hidden counter-revolutionary spies, and abandon the wrong idea of 'sweeping only the snow in front of our own door.'" Bai Yongxiang, a worker at the People's Printing Factory, reminded everyone, "We have been liberated, and we must also help liberate the Hui compatriots in the Great Northwest; let us not forget them." Liu Jingquan, an employee of the Telecommunications Bureau, said, "Only by relying closely on the Communist Party can we achieve liberation; in the future, we must rely on it even more." Zhang Deliang, an employee of the Water Company, denounced the crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries, reminding the Hui people to recognize friends and enemies and to expose counter-revolutionary spies. Ma Chunguang, an employee of the Pingjin Railway Bureau, suggested that all representatives should lead Hui compatriots from all sectors in resolutely implementing the resolutions of the All-Circles Representatives Conference.
