　　Exhibition Brochure for Soviet Construction Pictures
    Preparatory Committee of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
　　Foreword
    The Soviet Union is the first socialist country in human history and a powerful fortress of peace and democracy in the world. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people are not only capable of revolution but also of construction. In thirty-two years, they have built a great and brilliant socialist country, and now they are gradually moving from socialism to communism. The vigorous development of the Soviet economy, the flourishing of culture, the prosperity and happiness of the people's lives, and the strength of the country all clearly prove that socialism is incomparably better than capitalism. The direction of the Soviet Union is the direction that all mankind in the world must take.
    Our Chinese people's democratic revolution has now achieved basic victory. In the future, we will enter a great stage of construction. Who is our teacher? Chairman Mao said: "The CPSU is our best teacher. We must learn from the CPSU." What should we learn? Learn from the Soviet Union's construction experience and transform our great motherland from a backward agricultural country into an advanced, prosperous, and powerful industrial country.
    The purpose of the Preparatory Committee of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in organizing this exhibition is to systematically introduce the situation of Soviet construction to the broad masses of people in our motherland. The materials are divided into "Soviet Post-War Economic Recovery and Development," "Industry," "Agriculture," "Education," "Science," "People's Life," "Women," "Children," and "Elections and Revolutionary Festivals." Due to the rush of time, the collection of materials is not complete, and the organization and arrangement work is not perfect enough. We hope for guidance and criticism from all circles!
    We would like to express our special thanks to the Soviet Foreign Culture Association and all parties for their enthusiastic assistance in this exhibition.
　　I. Post-War Economic Recovery and Development
    During the Patriotic War, the Soviet national economy suffered severe damage from the German fascist bandit army. After the victory of the war, the Soviet Union implemented the first post-war Five-Year Plan, vigorously restoring the disaster-stricken areas, planning to restore industrial and agricultural production to, and even greatly exceed, pre-war levels. In order to implement this plan, the people of the entire Soviet Union launched a warm work competition. By the end of 1947, industrial production had reached pre-war levels. In the three years after the war—from 1946 to 1948—more than four thousand state-owned enterprises were built and restored. The traces of the war have been completely eliminated. Now, the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union are advancing towards a communist society in accordance with Stalin's great construction plan.
　　II. Industry
    Imperial Russia was a backward agricultural country, but after the October Revolution, under the leadership of the CPSU, the Soviet Union adopted the policy of industrialization and quickly became a powerful industrial country. On the eve of World War II, its industrial production had surpassed countries such as Britain, France, and Germany, and had jumped to the first place in Europe.
    According to the post-war Five-Year Plan, its machine manufacturing production in 1950 was to increase one hundred times compared to 1913 (the most developed year of Russian industry before the revolution). At the same time, the labor process within Soviet enterprises was almost entirely mechanized. Taking the basic figures of electrification, in the coal industry it reached 94 percent before the war, and in the machine manufacturing industry it reached 95 percent. Many of its industrial sectors, especially metallurgy and chemical sectors, have adopted a large number of automatic devices.
　　III. Collective Farms
    The collectivization of small-scale farming is a necessary condition for building socialism. So-called collectivization means that farmers, according to the principle of voluntariness, unite their scattered small plots of land into a large unit, which is collectively operated by the farmers who join this unit. This unit is called a collective farm. Farmers who join the farm are called collective farmers. The collective farm is one of the socialist economic forms.
    Collective farms have become the main form of rural economy in the Soviet Union. There are 250,000 collective farms in the Soviet Union. More than 20 million farming households have joined, accounting for 95.6 percent of all farming households. The land cultivated by collective farms accounts for 99.2 percent of the country's cultivated land area. Each collective farm has an average of 400 hectares of cultivated land. The Soviet Union is the country with the largest and most advanced rural economy in the world.
    Due to the collectivization of farmers, Soviet agriculture can apply the latest technology and implement mechanization. For this purpose, the Soviet Union has systematically established 5,617 machine tractor stations across the country to supply collective farms. 91.5 percent of the cultivated land of collective farms is cultivated by machine tractor stations. In 1940, there were 523,000 tractors and 182,000 combine harvesters in the Soviet Union. The mechanization of basic agricultural work in the Soviet Union ranks first in the world.
    Due to agricultural collectivization, Soviet farmers have also broken away from the difficult and dark life of the countryside and embarked on a path of increasingly prosperous cultural life. Collective farms have facilities such as schools, clubs, cinemas, hospitals, research laboratories, laundries, canteens, and nurseries. In this way, the opposition between the countryside and the city caused by capitalism is gradually disappearing.
    In addition, state-owned farms are also set up throughout the Soviet Union as models for large-scale cultivation and animal husbandry. There are more than 4,000 such state-owned farms, each with an average cultivated area of more than 4,000 hectares.
    Collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state-owned farms are the main methods by which the Soviet Union socializes the rural economy.
　　IV. Army
    The Soviet army is a new type of army, a truly people's armed force.
    On February 23, 1918, in the battle of Pskov, the Soviet Workers' and Peasants' Red Army defeated the German occupiers, so this day became the anniversary of the birth of the Soviet Red Army.
    The Soviet army has an extremely glorious history. After the October Revolution, under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, it crushed foreign armed intervention, victoriously ended the domestic war, and guaranteed the peaceful construction of the Soviet Union.
    In World War II, the Soviet army annihilated the German fascist bandit army in the West, recovered its own territory, and liberated many countries in Central and Eastern Europe, enabling them to embark on the road of new democracy; in the East, it annihilated the million-strong Kwantung Army of Japanese imperialism, liberated our Northeast and North Korea, and promoted the surrender of Japanese imperialism.

　　苏联建设图片展览会说明书
    中苏友好协会总会筹委会
　　前言
    苏联是人类历史上头一个社会主义国家，是世界上和平与民主的强大堡垒。苏联人民，在苏联共产党领导之下，不但会革命，也会建设。他们在三十二年的时间中，已经建设成了一个伟大的光辉灿烂的社会主义国家，现在他们正由社会主义逐渐进到共产主义。苏联的经济的蓬勃发展，文化的欣欣向荣，人民生活的富裕与快乐，国力的强大，这些都明白地证明了社会主义比资本主义无比地好。苏联的方向，是全世界人类要走的方向。
    我们中国的人民民主革命，现在已经获得了基本的胜利。今后我们将进入一个伟大的建设阶段。我们的老师是谁呢？毛主席说：“联共，就是我们最好的先生。我们必须向联共学习。”学习什么呢？学习苏联的建设经验，把我们的伟大的祖国从落后的农业国变成先进的富强的工业国。
    中苏友好协会总会筹委会办这个展览会的目的，也就是想把苏联建设的情形，比较有系统地介绍给我们祖国的人民大众。材料分“苏联战后经济的恢复与发展”，“工业”，“农业”，“教育”，“科学”，“人民的生活”，“妇女”，“儿童”，“选举与革命节日”等项。因时间仓促，材料收集的还不完全，整理和布置工作也不够完善。尚盼各界指导和批评！
    此次展览会，承苏联对外文化协会和各方面的热烈协助，特表谢忱。
　　一、战后的经济恢复与发展
    在卫国战争时期，苏联国民经济曾遭受德国法西斯匪军的严重破坏。战争胜利结束后，苏联就实行战后第一次五年计划，大力恢复受灾区域，计划把工农业生产恢复，乃至大大地超过战前水平。为了执行这个计划，全苏联人民展开了热烈的工作竞赛。一九四七年底，工业生产即已达到战前的水准。在战后三年——一九四六至一九四八年间，建设和恢复的国家企业，共有四千多所。战争的痕迹已经完全消灭了。现在苏联的各民族人民，正依着斯大林的巨大建设计划，向着共产主义社会迈进。
　　二、工业
    帝俄本是一个落后的农业国，但是在十月革命后，苏联在联共领导之下，采取工业化的方针，很快地就变成了一个强大的工业国。在第二次世界大战前夕，它的工业生产，已超过英、法、德等国家，而跃居欧洲第一位。
    按照战后五年计划，它的机器制造业的生产，在一九五○年要比一九一三年（即革命前俄国工业最发达的一年）增加一百倍。同时，苏联企业内的劳动过程，几乎全部机械化了。以电气化的基本数字说，在煤炭业中在战前达百分之九十四，而在机器制造业中达百分之九十五。它的许多工业部门，特别是冶金，化学等部门，都大量地采用了自动装置。
　　三、集体农场
    小农经营的集体化是建设社会主义的一个必要条件。所谓集体化，就是农民根据自愿的原则，把各自分散经营的小块土地联合起来，成为一个大单位，由加入这个单位的农民共同集体经营。这种单位叫做集体农场。加入农场的农民叫做集体农民。集体农场是社会主义经济形式之一。
    集体农场已成为苏联农村经济的主要形式。苏联全国共有二十五万所集体农场。加入的农民有二千多万户，即全体农户百分之九五·六。集体农场耕种的土地占全国耕地面积百分之九九·二。每所集体农场平均有耕地四百公顷。苏联是世界上农村经济规模最大最先进的一个国家。
    由于农民的集体化，苏联农业就可以应用最新技术和实行机械化了。为了这个目的，苏联有计划地在全国各地建立了五千六百一十七所机器拖拉机站，供应集体农场。集体农场耕地由机器拖拉机站耕种的达百分之九一·五。一九四○年时，全苏联共有拖拉机五十二万三千架，联合机十八万二千架。苏联农业基本工作之机器化要占世界第一位。
    由于农业集体化，苏联的农民也就脱离了乡村困苦黑暗的生活，而走上日益富裕文化生活的道路。集体农场里有学校、俱乐部、电影院、医院、研究试验室、洗衣所、食堂、托儿所等设备。这样，资本主义所造成的乡村与城市对立，也就逐渐消失掉。
    另外，苏联全国各地还设有国营农场，作为大规模耕作和饲养牲畜之模范。这种国营农场共有四千多所，每所耕种面积平均在四千公顷以上。
    集体农场、机器拖拉机站、国营农场，这就是苏联使农村经济社会主义化的主要办法。
　　四、军队
    苏联军队是一种新型的军队，是真正人民的武装力量。
    一九一八年二月二十三日，在普斯科夫的战役中，苏联工农红军曾打败了德国的占领者，所以，这一天就成了苏联红军诞生的纪念节日。
    苏联军队有极光荣的历史。在十月革命后，它在列宁和斯大林领导下，粉碎了外国武装干涉，胜利地结束国内战争，保证了苏联的和平建设。
    在第二次世界大战中，苏联军队，在西方歼灭了德国法西斯匪军，恢复了自己的国土，并解放了中欧和东欧许多国家，使它们走上了新民主主义的道路；在东方，它歼灭了日本帝国主义的百万关东军，解放了我们的东北和北朝鲜，促成了日本帝国主义的投降。  　　　（未完）
