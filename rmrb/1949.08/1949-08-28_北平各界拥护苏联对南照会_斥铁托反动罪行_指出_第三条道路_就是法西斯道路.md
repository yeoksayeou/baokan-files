Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, August 26th: Since the Soviet government successively published the notes and replies regarding the Tito reactionary clique of Yugoslavia's perfidious behavior towards the Soviet Union on the Austrian question and the criminal acts of illegally arresting Soviet citizens, the Chinese people have expressed great anger at the Tito clique's reactionary behavior. Newspapers in Beiping have been publishing these news items in prominent positions for several days. People from all walks of life have strongly condemned the Tito clique's despicable behavior of acting as a running dog of American imperialism and its fascist ways, and warmly supported the Soviet Union's notes and replies to the Yugoslav government. Guo Moruo, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Mao Dun, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and Huang Caoliang, a Chinese journalist representative attending the World Congress for the Defence of Peace, have successively commented on this issue on Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station.

　　Guo Moruo said: Today's Tito, in our view, is completely following the old path that Chiang Kai-shek took twenty-three years ago. And Tito appears in the guise of communism, which is even more tragic than Chiang Kai-shek, who came from the stock exchange. But today's Chiang Kai-shek has been overthrown by the Chinese people! Chiang Kai-shek's today is Tito's tomorrow. Anyone who betrays the people will be abandoned by the people.

　　Qian Junrui said: The Tito clique has become the most loyal and insidious running dog of American and British imperialism. As practitioners of bourgeois nationalism, the Tito clique can never take any "independent," "middle road," or third road. In fact, it has already embarked on the traitorous fascist road of Chiang Kai-shek.

　　Cai Chang said: The Tito clique has now completely degenerated into the mire of betraying the country and siding with the imperialist camp. The Tito clique's fate is the inevitable result of its anti-Soviet policy. Anyone who opposes the Soviet Union will inevitably embark on such a degenerate and reactionary path.

　　Liu Ningyi said: From the first day that Tito betrayed the proletariat and the anti-imperialist democratic camp, he threw himself into the reactionary camp of imperialism. There is no and cannot be a third road outside these two camps. The Chinese Communist Party pointed out from the beginning that Tito and his clique are traitors of the same kind as Zhang Guotao. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have fully realized the commonality between the Tito clique and Chiang Kai-shek in essence from the experience of the struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek clique. In China, anyone who intends to follow Tito's path, then Chiang Kai-shek's fate awaits him.

　　Mao Dun said: The Tito incident proves a truth: In today's world, between the two major camps of revolution and counter-revolution, those who leave the revolutionary camp headed by the Soviet Union, no matter what banner of "nationalism" they are waving, or belong to what Acheson calls "democratic individualists," the result will inevitably be to throw themselves into the counter-revolutionary camp and become a tool of the anti-people imperialist group headed by American imperialism, and will eventually perish. Saying "neither pro-Soviet nor pro-American" or "leaning on both sides" in the international arena is actually surrendering to American imperialism.

　　Huang Caoliang said: The facts are already very clear: the Tito clique has degenerated into a loyal servant and running dog of American and British imperialism. They are gradually turning Yugoslavia into an imperialist colony, and they themselves have become imperialist watchdogs in the Balkans. However, this treacherous policy pursued by the Tito clique will not last long, because the increasingly awakened people of Yugoslavia will not agree to it.

　　北平各界拥护苏联对南照会
  　斥铁托反动罪行
    指出“第三条道路”就是法西斯道路
    【新华社北平二十六日电】自从苏联政府连续公布了关于南斯拉夫铁托反动集团在对奥问题上对苏联的背信弃义行为及非法逮捕苏联公民的罪恶行为的照会与复文后，中国人民对于铁托集团的反动行为，表示了极大的愤怒。北平各报连日在显著地位刊载了这些消息。各界人民纷纷痛斥铁托集团这种充当美帝国主义走狗和法西斯式的卑鄙行为，热烈拥护苏联给南斯拉夫政府的照会与复文。中苏友好协会筹备委员会副主任郭沫若，中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅，中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一，中华全国文学艺术界联合会全国委员会副主席茅盾以及中苏友好协会筹委会总干事钱俊瑞，出席世界拥护和平大会的中国新闻界代表黄操良等，先后在北平新华广播电台就这一问题发表评论。
    郭沫若说：今天的铁托，在我们看来，完全走的是二十三年前蒋介石所走的老路。而铁托是以共产主义的姿态出现的，比起跑交易所的流氓出身的蒋介石，堕落得更加悲惨。但今天的蒋介石被我们中国人民打倒了！蒋介石的今天，就是铁托的明天。凡是背叛人民的人，一定要为人民所共弃的。
    铁俊瑞说：铁托集团已经变成美英帝国主义最忠实和最阴险的走狗。作为资产阶级民族主义实行者的铁托集团，决不能走什么“独立的”“中间路线”或第三条道路，事实上它已经走上蒋介石式的卖国法西斯道路。
    蔡畅说：铁托集团现在已经完全堕落到卖国和投靠帝国主义阵营的泥坑里去了。铁托集团的下场，是它执行反苏政策的必然结果。谁要是反对苏联，他就必然走上这样堕落的反动的道路。
    刘宁一说：铁托自从他背叛无产阶级、背叛反帝民主阵营的第一天起，就投入了帝国主义的反动阵营，在这两个阵营之外，没有也不可能有第三条道路可走。中国共产党一开始就指出：铁托及其集团，就是和张国焘同类的叛徒。中国人民在毛主席的领导之下，从反对蒋介石集团的斗争经验中，完全认识到铁托集团与蒋介石在本质上的共同性。在中国，谁要是打算走铁托的道路，那么蒋介石命运就等待着他。
    茅盾说：铁托事件证明一个真理：在今日世界的革命与反革命的两大阵营之间，离开了以苏联为首的革命阵营的，不论他是打着什么“民族主义”的旗号，或者是属于象艾奇逊所说的什么“民主的个人主义者”，其结果必然是投入反革命阵营，做了美帝为首的反人民的帝国主义集团的工具，而最后必归于败亡。在国际上说什么“既不亲苏，也不亲美”或“两边靠”，实际上都是向美帝国主义投降。
    黄操良说：事实已经清清楚楚：铁托集团已经堕落成为美英帝国主义忠实的奴仆和走狗了。它们正在一步步地把南斯拉夫变成帝国主义的殖民地，他们自己已经变成帝国主义在巴尔干的鹰犬。但是，铁托集团所举行的这种叛卖政策，是不会维持好久的，因为日益觉悟的南斯拉夫的人民是不会答应的。
