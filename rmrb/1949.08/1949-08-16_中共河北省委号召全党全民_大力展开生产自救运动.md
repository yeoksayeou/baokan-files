(Baoding Dispatch) The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call on August 12th to mobilize the entire Party and all the people to engage in production and self-salvation to overcome the famine. The call pointed out: Various places in our province have continuously suffered from floods, wind disasters, and insect plagues, with floods being the most serious. According to preliminary statistics: 44 counties have been affected by the disaster, 3,288 villages have been flooded, more than 10 million mu of land have been submerged, and the affected population is nearly 3 million. In addition, the Tangshan area has suffered from wind disasters, and Dingxian and Shimen areas have successively experienced insect plagues. Due to the devastation of the enemy and puppets over the years, and the long-term support of the broad masses for the revolutionary war, there is a lack of savings. Therefore, under the severe circumstances of these three disasters occurring simultaneously, people's lives have become extremely difficult. The entire Party must fully recognize the severity of this year's flood, with a high degree of responsibility to the people, share weal and woe, and vigorously lead the masses to widely carry out production and self-salvation movements. This has become the current urgent task of the Party throughout the province. To this end, the Provincial Committee specifically calls for: (1) The entire Party and all the people must be urgently mobilized to widely carry out the movement of saving to overcome the famine and production for disaster relief. All party, government, military, and civilian personnel and various economic departments must concentrate their efforts, unify their steps, fully mobilize and rely on the strength of the masses, give full play to the experience of overcoming famine in the past, closely integrate, divide responsibilities, and effectively lead the masses in disaster areas to vigorously carry out various production and self-salvation work. In various disaster areas, production for disaster relief must be taken as the central task for this winter and next spring, and special management organizations should be established; Party committees at all levels must effectively ensure the implementation of various production and disaster relief measures of the government. All cadres and Communist Party members should closely unite and rely on the masses, do their best to work day and night, and lead the masses to overcome difficulties. Play its glorious exemplary role in the production and self-salvation movement. (2) All party, government, military, and civilian agencies, as well as all cadres and soldiers, must strictly practice economy, cherish manpower and material resources, save expenses, eliminate waste, and reduce the burden on the people in all aspects. All cadres, party members, and soldiers must carry forward the spirit of hard work and plain living, share weal and woe with the people, and overcome the disaster together. In order to further support the people in disaster areas to overcome difficulties, the Provincial Committee specifically calls on all agencies and troops throughout the province to save one or two liang of rice per person per day (agencies above the district level can save more), and welcomes individuals to voluntarily donate money and rice to help the victims; the government will forward it to the disaster areas to carry out production and disaster relief. (3) The people of the whole province must unite closely and carry forward the fine tradition of mutual assistance and mutual relief. The difficulties of the people in some areas of the province are also the difficulties of all the people in the province. Therefore, all urban and rural non-disaster areas should practice economy, tighten their belts, and do their best to help and relieve the masses in disaster areas. To this end, the Provincial Committee specifically calls on various places to carry out a "bowl of rice movement" on a completely voluntary basis to express the assistance of the people in non-disaster areas to the masses in disaster areas. Under this severe disaster situation, the broad masses in disaster areas are encountering serious difficulties in life and production; but we have the close unity of the Party and the people, various places have rich experience in production and overcoming famine, and there is unity and mutual support between all cadres, party members, soldiers, people, and the masses in disaster and non-disaster areas, coupled with the strong leadership of the Party and the People's Government, we can completely overcome difficulties and overcome the disaster through production and self-salvation. The entire Party and all the people must strengthen their confidence, work hard, and strive for the victory of the movement to save to overcome the famine and production for self-salvation.
