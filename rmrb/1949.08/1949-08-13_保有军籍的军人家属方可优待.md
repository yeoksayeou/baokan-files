    Family Members of Soldiers Retaining Military Status Eligible for Preferential Treatment
    To the Editor:
    I have a few questions that I cannot resolve myself, please answer them for me:
    1. If my husband is studying at a military university, is my family considered a military family? Are we eligible for preferential treatment as a military family?
    2. It is said that all the dependents of military university personnel in Peiping are awaiting investigation by the military region headquarters, and may receive food rations and be introduced to jobs, and may also receive training and study. Is this true?
    3. Can my six-year-old child be sent to the local elementary school (such as Rongzhen Elementary School) for free? What are the procedures?
    4. As a knowledgeable woman in the family (who also worked during the War of Resistance Against Japan), I now want to serve in the cultural and educational fields. How can I find work? Which women's production guidance organizations in Peiping can I join for production? Wishing you
    Editorial peace. Sincerely, Sha Yin
    Mr. Sha Yin:
    The following are the answers to your questions from the Peiping Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau:
    (1) Generally, family members of students during their study period are not eligible for preferential treatment. However, if they are dispatched by the troops or organizations to participate in the study, and retain their military status, they will still be treated as military dependents.
    (2) We are not aware of this matter and cannot answer.
    (3) If military dependent status has been obtained, and it is confirmed through investigation that they are indeed impoverished, the district government can issue a letter of introduction to apply to municipal elementary schools. If their grades are the same as other students, they will be given priority for admission, and tuition and miscellaneous fees can be waived.
    (4) The district governments are currently investigating unemployed military dependents. If you meet the conditions of military dependent as answered in item (1), you can register, and we may be able to provide job introductions when opportunities arise.    Editor

    保有军籍的军人家属方可优待
    编辑同志：
    我有下面几个问题，自己不能解决，请你答复一下吧：
    一、丈夫在军大学习期间，家中是否算军属？能否享受军属优待？
    二、据说在平所有的军大眷属，候军区司令部调查，或有食粮供给，并可能介绍工作，还要训练学习不知确实否？
    三、小孩六岁能否免费送入那里的小学校（如荣臻小学）？手续怎办？
    四、在家庭的知识妇女（过去在抗日战争也工作过），现在要想服务于文化教育界，自己如何谋工作？那些在平的妇女指导生产机构可以让加入生产？祝
    编安  沙音敬上
    沙音先生：
    你所问的问题承北平市人民政府民政局答复如下：
    （一）一般在学习期间的学员，家属不能享受优待。如系由部队或机关调派参加学习，保留军籍的，仍然按军属待遇。
    （二）本项问题不了解，无法答复。
    （三）如已取得军属地位，经调查确实贫苦者，可由所在区政府，出具介绍信，报考市立小学，其成绩与一般学生同等时尽先录取，并可免交学杂费。
    （四）现在各区政府正调查失业军属，你如合于第一项所答的军属条件，即可以办理登记手续，遇有机会，可为介绍。    编者
