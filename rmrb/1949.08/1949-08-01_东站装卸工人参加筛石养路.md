    East Station Loading and Unloading Workers Participate in Screening Stones to Maintain Roads
    [This City News] Since July 24th, the loading and unloading workers of the East Station have been participating in the stone screening and road maintenance work called for by the Engineering Section in groups, and they have launched a heated competition. In the first two days of the competition, the first group of ten people did three to four meters of work in three hours. Subsequently, it increased to five meters, and on the 28th and 29th, it exceeded ten meters. Because they did not have enough tools, they used them in turns, which greatly affected their work. Therefore, they held a group meeting on July 29th. After discussion, everyone decided to bring their own tools as much as possible. After the meeting, Meng Zhaosheng, a worker in the first group, joined with others in his group, and they raised 1,200 yuan to buy the necessary materials and made two screens. Worker Wang Zhongyu said, "Now that we have two more screens, we are not afraid of not keeping up with the other groups." The work enthusiasm of each group is very high, and the mutual competition is very energetic. (Wu Xijun)

    东站装卸工人参加筛石养路
    【本市讯】东站装卸工人，自从七月二十四日分组参加工务段号召的筛石碴养路工作以来，便展开了热烈的竞赛。在竞赛开始的头两天，第一组十个人，在三个钟头的时间内便作了三、四米长度的活，随后增加到五米，到了二十八、九两天便超过了十米的长度。他们因为工具不够，轮流使用，工作很受影响，所以在七月二十九日开了小组会，大家讨论结果，决定自己尽量带工具。会后第一组工人孟昭升，联合他们一组的人，大家凑了一千二百元买了应用材料，做了两个筛子。工人王忠钰说：“我们多了两个筛子，不怕赶不上别的组了。”各组的工作热情都很高，相互竞赛非常起劲。      （吴锡浚）
