The new draft constitution stipulates that Hungary is a people's republic of workers and working peasants, with the parliament as the highest organ of state power.

The draft constitution stipulates that military service is the glorious duty of all citizens; the task of the Supreme Court is to punish the enemies of the working people, protect the political, economic, and social order of the people's democratic state, and protect all the rights of state institutions and the working people. The draft constitution also stipulates that foreigners persecuted for activities in the interest of the people's liberation will be protected in Hungary.

The draft constitution, which will be submitted to the next parliament for approval, has been warmly welcomed by the Hungarian people. According to a TASS report on the 8th, the *Független Magyarország* newspaper published comments on the draft constitution by representatives of workers, peasants, intellectuals, and other strata of people. Middeki, a worker at the Atheneum Publishing House, said: "Our motherland has now become a country of close alliance between workers and working peasants under the leadership of the working class. We workers guarantee that we will use the rights stipulated in the draft constitution to defend the Hungarian People's Republic and its constitution." Ratz, the General Secretary of the Hungarian Working Peasants' and Agricultural Laborers' Alliance, said that he felt the greatest pleasure because the Hungarian people have, for the first time in history, such a constitution, which guarantees the people's (including the peasants') right to participate in politics. The People's Republic recognizes and guarantees the peasants' right to land and helps the socialist development of agriculture.
