[Report from Our Newspaper] The Preparatory Committee of the Representative Conference of Chinese Social Science Workers held a symposium on the White Paper issued by U.S. Imperialism at the Beijing Hotel on the morning of August 26th, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. In his concluding remarks at the symposium, Comrade Lin Boqu called on Chinese social science workers to particularly study Lenin's "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," and to recognize the importance of understanding the essence of imperialism and educating those who harbor illusions about U.S. imperialism. The following is a summary of Comrade Lin Boqu's concluding remarks:

Comrade Lin Boqu began by saying: "This meeting was very successful. In the White Paper, U.S. imperialism nakedly exposed the various facts of U.S. imperialism's aggression against China, while helplessly confessing to the failure of its aid to Chiang Kai-shek and acknowledging the victory of the Chinese people. But it will not be reconciled. It has brought out the signboard of 'democratic individualism,' painted with the U.S. trademark, in an attempt to undermine the victory of the Chinese people. Therefore, we must educate the people, educate all those who cannot clearly distinguish between issues, and expose the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism." Comrade Boqu particularly drew everyone's attention: "To clarify the issue, the fundamental point is to learn to use the methods of Marxism-Leninism, to recognize the essence of imperialism, to analyze all the characteristics of imperialism, and to fundamentally understand the reactionary, counter-revolutionary, and aggressive policies that it inevitably adopts at home and abroad. Therefore, I propose that we should carefully read Lenin's 'Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism,' and greatly publicize Lenin's 'Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism,' so that everyone understands what imperialism is and why U.S. imperialism is the enemy of the Chinese people. Secondly, we must also specifically study U.S. imperialism, so that the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism can be combined with the practice of our current revolution. Therefore, I suggest that we can also take a look at pamphlets like 'America's 60 Families'. The author of 'America's 60 Families' is not a Marxist, but it provides many specific facts that can be used as a reference for studying U.S. imperialism." Regarding "democratic individualism," Comrade Boqu said: "The existence of so-called democratic individualism in China is not a strange thing. The economic position of these people is weak, and they are politically wavering. Some of them harbor illusions and fears about U.S. imperialism. This is determined by the limitations of their class nature and the influence of their cultural education. In addition to improving ourselves, we social science workers also have a responsibility to help them progress. In Acheson's eyes, the White Paper is naturally the best recruitment advertisement for 'democratic individualist' elements, used to 'encourage' them to join and seek 'development.' But in the eyes of the Chinese people, the White Paper is just U.S. imperialism attempting to drag those who still have illusions about the United States to their doom while confessing their crimes. Many of our so-called 'democratic individualists' are patriotic. Acheson's methods made these people lose face, poured cold water on them, and pushed their illusions about the United States onto the road to disillusionment. Contrary to Acheson, we are guiding these people onto the path of revolutionary struggle, first distinguishing them from the enemy. We are honestly persuading them, based on facts, sincerely telling them, and seriously criticizing them in an appropriate and well-meaning way. We will use the White Paper to make them also recognize U.S. imperialism and unite in the great cause of the Chinese people's revolution. This is our responsibility."

    号召学习列宁的“帝国主义论”　教育那些对美帝存有幻想的人
    我们的责任：是把“民主个人主义”者引导到革命斗争道路上来
    【本报讯】中国社会科学工作者代表会议筹备会于八月二十六日上午假北京饭店座谈美帝发表之白皮书问题，已志昨报。林伯渠同志在座谈会的结束语中，号召中国社会科学工作者要特别学习列宁的“帝国主义论”，认清帝国主义的本质和教育那些对美帝存有幻想的人们的重要意义。以下是林伯渠同志结束语的摘要：
    林伯渠同志首先说：“这个会开得很好。美帝国主义在白皮书中，赤裸裸地暴露美帝国主义侵略中国的各种事实，同时无可奈何地招供了援蒋的失败和承认了中国人民胜利的事实。但它不会甘心，它又搬出‘民主的个人主义’这块涂着美国商标的招牌来，企图破坏中国人民的胜利。因此，我们必须教育人民，教育一切不能清楚分别问题的人们，揭穿美帝国主义的阴谋计划。”伯渠同志特别提起大家注意：“要把问题弄清楚，基本的一点是学习运用马克思列宁主义的方法，认清帝国主义的本质，分析帝国主义的一切特征，从根本上来了解其对内对外所必然采取的反动反革命和侵略的政策。因此，我提议我们应当好好地阅读列宁的‘帝国主义论’，并大大地宣传列宁的‘帝国主义论’，使大家了解什么是帝国主义和为什么美帝国主义是中国人民的敌人。其次，还要具体地研究美帝国主义，使马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和我们当前革命的实践结合起来。因此，我建议我们还可以看看‘美国一千人’这类小册子。“美国一千人”的作者并不是马克思主义者，但它供给了不少的具体事实，可作研究美帝国主义的参考。”关于“民主的个人主义”，伯渠同志说：“所谓民主的个人主义在中国的存在，不是什么奇怪的事。这些人的经济地位是软弱的，在政治上是动摇的，其中一部分人对美帝国主义存有幻想和恐惧，这是由于他们的阶级性所限制和他们所受的文化教育等影响所决定的。我们社会科学工作者除了提高自己之外，还有责任帮助他们进步。白皮书在艾奇逊的眼里，自然是对‘民主的个人主义’分子的一张最好的招生广告，是用来‘鼓励’他们去投效，去求得‘发展’的。但在中国人民看来，白皮书只是美帝国主义在招认罪状之时企图把那些对美国还有幻想的分子拉去作殉葬者罢了。我们这里很多所谓‘民主的个人主义’者是有爱国心的。艾奇逊的手法丢了这些人的脸，浇了他们一瓢冷水，把这些人对美国的幻想推上了幻灭的道路。和艾奇逊相反，我们是把这些人引导到革命斗争的道路上来，首先把他们和敌人区别开来。我们对他们是老老实实的说服，是根据事实，掬诚以告，是严肃的与人为善的适当批评。利用白皮书，叫他们也认清美帝国主义，团结在伟大的中国人民革命事业之中。这就是我们的责任。”
