　　Municipal Elementary Schools to Post Results Tomorrow
　　Over a Thousand Children of Workers Admitted
　　Education Bureau Instructs Continued Enrollment
    [This Newspaper's Report] In order to solve the problem of school enrollment for workers' children, the Municipal Education Bureau has decided to add more classes to the municipal elementary schools this semester. Testing was conducted in districts a few days ago, and the results will be posted on the 24th, with a total of 1,340 students admitted. They have now been graded and assigned to classes. Considering that the schools still have vacancies, all schools are hereby notified to openly enroll students after the 24th, and it is stipulated that children of workers and revolutionary martyrs and cadres should be given priority for enrollment (workers' children must hold certificates from the Federation of Trade Unions, and children of revolutionary martyrs and cadres must hold formal supporting documents from their organizations or military units).
