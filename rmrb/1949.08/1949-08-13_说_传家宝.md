    Speaking of "Heirlooms"
    Wang Binyang

    "The mother-in-law only wants to pass down her three treasures, but the daughter-in-law feels that there's not much future in them, and she can't make a living by accepting them..."

    This is a story written by Zhao Shuli, a story recording the transformation of rural women in today's liberated areas from one way of life to another. This transformation is shown through the common phenomenon in traditional Chinese families—the contradiction between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. We should understand it as a chapter of history, a mirror, the brilliance of which reflects into various villages and towns, and has its educational significance: women must participate in major labor.

    The contradiction between Li Chengniang (mother-in-law) and Jin Gui (daughter-in-law), that is, the contradiction between the two old and new lifestyles, is what?

    "She has three treasures: a spinning wheel, a sewing basket, and this black box." The spinning wheel is Li Chengniang's production tool, and the sewing basket and black box store her means of production. We can say that these three treasures pitifully cast the epitome of the lives of all poor peasant women of the old days. This kind of life has been passed down from generation to generation, accumulating in their minds a layer of rigid concepts: dealing with consumption is more important than dealing with production.

    "She wrapped a small cloth bag and ran back to her mother-in-law's room... Saying that, she opened the small bag, took out an account book and several stacks of bills." The small cloth bag includes the economic life of liberated women today, and the account book records their new concept of life: dealing with production is more important than dealing with consumption.

    It should not be forgotten: productivity is always developed in society, under a certain social order. In that decadent and inherited old society, Li Chengniang, Li Chengniang's mother, Li Chengniang's grandmother, generation after generation, couldn't eat even half a kilogram of oil a year, and sat all day on a small stool with their heads down, facing the faint light of the firewood door to mend clothes, make padding, or shake that groaning spinning wheel. Their production was slow, mechanical, and unconscious. From marriage to the dowry, the treasures have been worn away by time, and their faces have been worn yellow and thin by life, and they still want to "pass this career down one stroke at a time." They also have their opinions, their views: "Men have men's work, women have women's work..."

    However, a new society, a new historical century has arrived; the vast crowd is creating its own destiny, acting as conscious creatures. Jin Gui! She can keep accounts, she can calculate; she doesn't like sitting at home mending and darning, she loves going to the fields to work, loves carrying coal. She has a high degree of awareness of production and a wealth of knowledge about the labor she does. Although the means of production are currently unable to be improved, she can squeeze the maximum amount of production from her physical strength.

    Production: from slow to active, from mechanical to calculated, from unconscious to conscious. Its growing movement has shaken the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law closed in the small courtyard. The hurried coming and going of cooperatives and mutual aid groups has replaced the lonely back-beating sounds at dusk. The destruction of the old family system made Li Chengniang feel confusedly that she had lost her dignity, face, and leadership, and felt that people didn't consult her about big and small matters. "Let her destroy me first!" May I ask, is it by relying on obedience, filial piety—these ornaments in ancient families—that we are not annihilated? Or is it by relying on the material resources necessary for daily life that we are not annihilated? However, she always thought that Jin Gui was: "The dog is catching mice, meddling in other people's business." Saying that, she shed a few old tears.

    "Saving is not wasting, things that must be used, using them cannot be considered wasting..." "What must be used, I have lived to be so old eating chaff and vegetables." Reducing the amount of consumption as much as possible, reducing it to approaching zero, this is the dogma or superstition of the old rural economic life, and even formed a moral meaning. "Now the world has changed, it has changed to where you don't have to eat chaff anymore." The revolution washed away the habit of blindly suppressing consumption, rescued the asceticism that suppressed the minimum conditions for maintaining animal life, and made the entire productive force of society (the material basis of social life), happiness, and prosperity develop in unity.

    The results of many historical studies, events, and facts from ancient and modern times, different evolutionary periods of social life, and the era of stormy changes have accumulated a lot, and they all illustrate the birth of new forms and new concepts of social life and the death of old forms and old concepts.

    Let Li Chengniang's heavy black box—the heirloom—be buried under the bed forever! Let what she should do, what she should manage, and what she should understand be displayed in front of people.

    说“传家宝”
    王宾阳
    “婆婆只想拿她的三件宝贝往下传，媳妇觉着那里边没大出息，接受下来也过不成日子……”
    这是赵树理写的一篇故事，一篇记载出今日解放区中的农村妇女由一种生活方式转变到另一种生活方式的故事。这种转变通过了中国传统的家庭里的普遍现象——婆媳间的矛盾——显示出来。我们应该把它理解为一章历史，一面镜子，这面镜子的光彩折射到各个乡村，各个城镇，便有它的教育的意义：妇女要参加主要劳动。
    李成娘（婆）和金桂（媳）的矛盾，也就是新旧两种生活方式的矛盾，是什么呢？
    “她有三件宝贝：一把纺车，一个针线筐和这口黑箱子。”纺车是李成娘的生产工具，针线筐和黑箱子贮藏了她的生产手段。我们可以说这三件宝贝可悯地铸成了旧日一切贫农妇女的生活缩影。这种生活世代相传，在她们脑海里冲积做一层僵化的观念：处理消费重于处理生产。
    “她却挟了个小布包返出来又跑到婆婆的房子里……说着就打开小包，取出一本帐和几叠票子来。”小布包包括了今日解放妇女的经济生活，那本帐记录着她们的新的生活观念：处理生产重于处理消费。
    不该忘掉：生产力永远是在社会中，在一定的社会秩序下发展的。在那腐朽的因袭的旧社会中，李成娘、李成娘的娘、李成娘的祖母，世世代代一年吃不上一斤油，成天低头坐在小凳上，迎着柴门的微光补衣服、打褙，或者摇起那呻吟的纺车。她们的生产是纡缓的，机械的，不自觉的。从出嫁到陪嫁的宝贝都为时光磨掉了颜色，脸也被生活磨黄磨瘦了，还想“把这份事业一字一板传下去。”她们也有她们的意见，观点：“男人有男人的活，女人有女人的活……”
    然而新的社会，新的历史世纪来到了；广大的人群正在创造着自己的命运，作为自觉的生物行动着。金桂！她会记帐，会算；她不爱坐在家里补补衲衲，爱到地里去作活，爱背煤。她对生产有高度的自觉性，对自己所做的劳动有丰厚的知识。虽然生产工具目前尚无力改善，但她能从自己的体力中压榨出最大限度的生产量来。
    生产：由纡缓的变为积极的，由机械的变为有计算的，由不自觉的变为自觉的。它的增长的运动使封闭在小院落里的婆媳关系动摇了。合作社，互助组匆促的往来代替了黄昏时寂寞的捶背声。旧家庭制度的毁灭使李成娘迷茫地觉得自己失去了尊严，面子，领导权，觉得大小事人家不跟她通一通风。“叫她先把我灭了吧！”试问我们是靠着顺从，孝敬——这些古老的家庭中的妆饰品——才不致绝灭呢？还是靠着日常生活所必需的物质资料才不致绝灭呢？然而她总以为金桂是：“狗捉老鼠，多管闲事。”说着还落了几点老泪。
    “节约是不浪费的意思，非用不行的东西，用了不能算是浪费……”“什么非用不行，我一辈子吃糠咽菜也活了这么大。”把消费量尽力缩减，缩减到渐近于零，这就是旧日农村经济生活的教条或迷信，甚至形成了一种道德的意义。“如今世道变了，变得不用吃糠了。”革命洗去了盲目地抑压消费的积习，解救了抑压维持动物生活的最低条件的苦行，使社会的全部生产力（社会生活的物质基础），幸福和繁荣，在统一中发展着。
    远古和现代，社会生活不同的进化时期，和暴风烈雨的变革时代的许多历史研究的结果，事变和事实已经积累了很多，它们都说明了社会生活新形式新观念的诞生和旧形式旧观念的死亡。
    让李成娘的那口沉重的黑箱子——传家宝——永远埋葬在床下吧！让他的该做的，该管的，该懂的事展示在人们的面前。
        一九四九年、八月、九日。
