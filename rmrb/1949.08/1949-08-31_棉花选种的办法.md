Methods of Cotton Seed Selection
    Cotton Improvement Office of the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government

    In order to improve the quality of cotton seeds on the existing basis, so as to supply the cotton seeds needed for expanding cotton planting next year, all cotton planting areas, especially areas with better original cotton seeds, should universally advocate seed selection. We put forward the following points for your reference on specific implementation methods.

　　Seed Selection Methods

    I. Overall Seed Retention: For all fields planted with "S" cotton, if the entire field is growing strongly, the plants are neat, the height is uniform, the yield is high, the quality is good, and everyone agrees, all the pre-frost cotton harvested should be kept for seed. However, individual inferior plants should be removed before and after flowering, or marked for separate harvesting.

    II. Partial Seed Retention: If only a part of a field is in the above situation, all the pre-frost cotton harvested from this good part should be kept for seed. The other bad parts should be separated with straw ropes and harvested separately, and not kept for seed.

    III. Individual Plant Seed Selection: If a field is growing unevenly, with various good and bad cotton plants mixed together, in the early stage of boll opening, go to the field and select cotton plants that are growing strongly, moderately tall, with large and numerous bolls, early opening, few diseases and pests, and similar types, and tie a straw rope or cloth strip to the top of each selected good plant as a marker. When harvesting, separate the pre-frost cotton from the selected good plants and put them together for seed use, and do not keep the others for seed. If an entire field is growing poorly, or the cotton seeds are too mixed, no seeds should be kept.

    IV. Native Cotton Seed Selection: If native cotton and "S" cotton are mixed in the same field, all native cotton should not be selected for seed, to avoid mixing with foreign cotton. In areas that originally planted native cotton, native cotton seed selection can also be carried out according to the above methods. However, each region should make appropriate restrictions on native cotton cultivation based on local actual conditions. Where it is possible to switch to planting "S" cotton, the masses should be encouraged to gradually replace native cotton with "S" cotton.

    V. Mastering Excellent Cotton Seeds: The North China Cotton Improvement Office has other regulations for the selection and maintenance of excellent American cotton varieties that it is promoting and propagating in various places this year, which can be implemented according to the office's methods.

　　Regulation of Cotton Seeds

    I. Each region can, in the spirit of expanding the cotton planting area next year, and according to the actual local situation, specifically assign the cotton production tasks for next year to the villages during the wheat sowing period, so that each cotton planting village and household can make planned preparations for cotton seeds based on the planned number of acres for cotton planting next year.

    II. Each farmer prepares cotton seeds based on the planned number of acres for cotton planting next year. Farmers who are able to implement seed selection this year should give priority to using the selected and retained cotton seeds for their own use. All surplus beyond their own needs should be supplied to others for exchange or purchase. Farmers who have not been able to select and retain seeds, or whose selected and retained quantity is insufficient, can exchange (with an added amount for ordinary cotton seeds) or purchase seeds from farmers with a surplus of selected seeds based on their needs.

    III. The preparation of cotton seeds shall be organized by the village for farmers to adjust themselves within a certain period. By the beginning of December, the surplus or insufficient number of cotton seeds resulting from the self-adjustment of each village shall be reported to the county, and the county shall combine with neighboring counties to coordinate and adjust them according to the surplus and deficit situation of each village. By the beginning of January next year, the surplus or insufficient number of cotton seeds in each county shall be reported to the special district and forwarded to the provincial government. The cotton seeds needed in each region next year should be supplied as far as possible from the selected seeds in neighboring regions. If there is a surplus, or if there is a real shortage that cannot be resolved, the provincial government will report it to the higher-level government by the end of January, so that arrangements can be made as soon as possible to solve it in a unified manner.

    IV. For all cotton seeds obtained from seed selection that are surplus to the region's regulation needs, it is necessary to persuade the masses from an overall perspective to properly preserve them in order to supply the seed needs of other regions next spring, and not use them for oil extraction.

    V. In order to greatly increase cotton fields next year, the demand for cotton seeds is very large, and it mainly relies on each region to regulate and supply on the original basis (the Cotton Improvement Office can only lend and distribute excellent cotton seeds to about one million acres). Therefore, the standards for cotton field seed selection this year can be appropriately relaxed in areas where cotton seeds are very scarce and in areas where cotton seeds are generally mixed and inferior. At the same time, the masses should be called upon to plan to retain some of the generally inferior and degraded American cotton seeds, even if they do not meet the seed selection requirements, in order to make up for any shortages or for replanting. Before spring sowing is completed, they should not be lost or used for oil extraction, etc.

　　棉花选种的办法
    华北人民政府农业部棉产改进处
    为了在现有基础上，使棉种规格提高一步，以供应明年扩大植棉所需的棉籽，凡植棉地区特别是原有棉种较好的地区，均要普遍倡导选种。在具体实行办法上，我们提出下列几点，供各地参考。
　　选种方法
    一、全面留种：凡种植斯字棉，全田生长健壮，株式整齐，高矮均匀，产丰质良，大家一致认好的，将所收的霜前花，全部留种。但有个别劣株应于开花前后拔除，或作记号另行采收。
    二、局部留种：一块田里，如只有局部如同上述的情形，就将这好的一部分所收的霜前花全部留种；另外不好的部分，用草绳划开界限分开收花，不要留种。
    三、选株留种：一块田里，如生长不整齐，各样好坏的棉花混杂其间，可在吐絮初期，到田里选择生长健壮、高度适中，结桃大而多、吐絮早、病虫害少，而且类型相似的棉株，各在株顶结一条草绳或布条，作为标记。收花时将所选良株上的霜前花分开收摘在一处，留作种用，其他的不要留种。一块田里如果全部生长不良，或棉种混杂太甚，都不可留种。
    四、土棉选种：土棉和斯字棉混种在一块田里的，土棉一概不予选种留种，避免和洋棉掺杂。原来种土棉的地区，土棉选种，也可照上列的办法进行。但各地区应根据当地实际条件，对土棉栽培作适当的节制，能换种斯字棉的，要启发群众逐渐以斯字棉替代土棉。
    五、优良棉种的掌握：华北棉产改进处今年在各地推广繁殖的优良美棉，其选种和保持优种的办法，另有规定，可依照该处的办法去实行。
　　棉种的调剂
    一、各地区可依照明年度植棉面积将更扩大的精神，根据当地实际情况，在小麦播种期间把明年的棉花生产任务具体布置到村，以便每一植棉村、户能依据明年预定植棉的亩数，对棉种作有计划的准备。
    二、各农户依据其明年预定植棉的亩数准备棉种，今年有条件实行选种的农户，选留的棉种，尽先供本户自用。在自用需要量以外的，全部供应旁人换种或购种。凡未能选种留种或选留数量不够的农户，依据其需要数量，可向选种有余的农户自行换种（以普通棉籽加成调换）或购种。
    三、棉种的准备，在一定时期内，由村组织农户自行调剂，到十二月初，将各村自行调剂结果多余或不足的棉种数量，汇报到县，由县根据各村盈虚情况，并与邻近各县结合互相统筹调剂，明年一月初再将各县棉种多余或不足的数量，汇报到专区，转报省府。各地区明年所需棉种，以尽量就选种所得在邻近地区调剂供应为原则，其有多余的，或实感缺乏无从解决的，由省府于一月底汇报上级政府，以便及早设法统筹解决。
    四、凡选种所得的棉籽，本地区调剂有余的，必须从全面思想出发说服群众，妥为保留，以备供应其他地区明春的种籽需要，不要用以榨油。
    五、为了明年大量扩增棉田，棉种的需要量很大，而且主要依靠各地区就原有基础调剂供应（棉产改进处贷发优良棉种，约只能达到一百万亩），故今年的棉田选种，在种籽缺乏很多的地区，以及棉种普遍杂劣的地区，标准可以酌量放宽，同时要号召群众对于一般较次的退化美棉种籽，虽不合于选种要求，亦应有计划的保留一些，以备调剂不足或作补种之用，在春播未完成以前，勿使散失或作榨油等用。
