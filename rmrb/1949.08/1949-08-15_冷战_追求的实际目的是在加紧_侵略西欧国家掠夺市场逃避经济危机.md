The actual purpose of the "Cold War" is to intensify the invasion of Western European countries, plunder markets, and escape economic crisis.

Furthermore, the intensification of the anti-Soviet "Cold War" is pursuing definite international goals, primarily because of the acute deterioration of contradictions within the North Atlantic bloc.

Certain politicians in Marshall Plan countries recognize that implementing the plans of American monopoly capitalists not only means economic disaster for Western Europe but also significant social unrest. Everyone knows that even now, the living standards of the people of Western Europe are much lower than before the war, marked by mass unemployment and poverty. Therefore, as the approaching American economic crisis begins to show signs, it is only natural for Western European countries to strengthen their defenses against the arrogant demands of the United States.

The imperialists across the Atlantic are not idle either. Their strategies also take into account the rapidly approaching American economic crisis. What is their ultimate strategy? It is this: before the crisis reaches its peak, to completely control the entire organizational system of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty (whose purpose is to oppose the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries); to take over the management and command of Western European armies; to devalue the currencies of Marshall Plan countries in relation to the dollar, especially the pound sterling, in other words, to remove all obstacles and restrictions to dollar expansion; and to completely seize not only Western European markets but also all non-European markets that rely on Western Europe. These are the calculations of the American ruling clique's policies.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder's trip to Europe is to implement the economic aspect of these calculations. And the trip of the Chiefs of Staff to Europe is to put pressure on Congress and prepare to realize the military aspect of this calculation.

Recently, the "Cold War" conspiracy launched by the White House in a frenzy of anti-Soviet hysteria on the international stage indicates that American expansion in Western Europe has entered a new stage.

The commentator concludes: It is now very clear why American imperialists are implementing their militarist and aggressive plans at "supersonic" speed. This is because they are racing against time, and time is relentlessly working against them. However, their pursuit is in vain; the development of the situation has its own direction. The direction of the situation does not obey the command of the American ruling clique but reflects the basic laws of the modern era. That is to say, the strength of the peace-loving camp is growing day by day. The peace-loving camp will give an understandable and deserved response to the criminal conspiracies of the warmongers.

### “冷战”追求的实际目的是在加紧  侵略西欧国家掠夺市场逃避经济危机

    “冷战”追求的实际目的是在加紧
    侵略西欧国家掠夺市场逃避经济危机
    此外，反苏“冷战”的加紧，是追求着确定的国际目的的，这主要是因为北大西洋集团内部矛盾的尖锐恶化。
    马歇尔化各国的某些政客，认识到实行美国垄断资本家的计划，对于西欧不仅是意味着经济灾难，而且也意味着重大的社会动乱。大家都知道，即使就在现在，西欧人民的生活水平，要比战前低得多，而这种情形又以群众性的失业和贫困为其标志。因此，在逼近着的美国经济危机初现端倪的时候，西欧国家就加紧自卫，防备美国狂妄的要求，这是很自然的事。
    大西洋彼岸的帝国主义者，也不是在那里无所事事的。他们的策略上，也考虑到美国经济危机的迅速临近。他们的策略归根到底究竟是什么呢？那就是：在危机到达最高峰以前，把侵略性的北大西洋公约（它的目的是反对苏联和人民民主国家）的全部组织系统完全掌握在自己手中；把西欧军队的管理与指挥权拿过来；使马歇尔化各国的货币在对美元的比价上贬值，特别是英镑，换句话说，就是除去美元扩张的一切障碍和限制；不仅完全夺取西欧市场，而且夺取一切仰赖西欧的非欧洲市场。这些就是美国统治集团政策所打的算盘。
    美国财长斯奈德的欧洲之行，就是为了实现这些算盘中的经济的一面。而三军参谋长的欧洲之行，是为了给国会加诸压力，并准备实现这种算盘的中军事的一面。
    近来，在国际范围内，白宫方面在疯狂的反苏歇斯底里中发动的“冷战”阴谋，表明了美国在西欧的扩张已进入一新阶段。
    评论员结语称：美帝国主义者为什么以“超速”的速度实施他们军国主义的侵略计划，现在已十分清楚。这是因为，他们是在追赶时间，时间以无情的力量在起着不利于他们的作用。但是，他们追赶也是徒然的，形势的发展有着它自己的方向。形势发展的方向，并不听从美国统治集团的指挥，而是表现着现代的基本法则。这就是说，拥护和平阵营的力量与日俱增。对于战争贩子的罪恶阴谋，和平阵营定将给予可以理解的和应得的回答。
