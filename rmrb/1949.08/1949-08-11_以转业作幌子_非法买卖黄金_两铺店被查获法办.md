    Using Business Conversion as a Cover
    Illegally Buying and Selling Gold
    Two Shops Investigated and Prosecuted

    [This Newspaper News] De Fengheng Paper, Cigarette, and Kerosene Shop at No. 110 Meishi Street outside Qianmen, and Tong Fengheng Paper, Cigarette, and Kerosene Shop (formerly a gold shop converted to another business) at No. 7 Xiheyan (West Riverbank), colluded with each other under the guise of selling cigarettes, to conduct gold and silver trading. This has been discovered by the Outer Second Branch and handed over to the court for processing. On the 14th of last month, the First Police Station of the Outer Second Branch received a call from the People's Bank, informing them that De Fengheng was suspected of trading in gold and silver. That evening at 9 p.m., the station chief Li Zongliao, accompanied by ten police officers, went to check the household registration. Upon entering, they saw that the manager looked distraught, and the partners also looked at each other in dismay. The station chief immediately asked to inspect the backyard. It was discovered that partners Hao Jiying and Wu Yingkai were melting gold in the south room of the backyard using a furnace and bellows. Ten ingots of gold that had not yet been melted were taken from the melting trough, and a gold bracelet was picked up from the ground. Returning to the front yard to inquire about the manager, Cao Zhuhua, the perpetrator had already taken the opportunity to escape. After questioning the partners separately, it was learned that Hao and Wu were partners from Tong Fengheng in Xiheyan, and had come here to melt gold for De Fengheng. They also pointed out that there was a small hole behind the screen in the west room, as well as under the sofa and on the beams of the south room, which were the places where the shop usually stored gold and silver. After inspection, another eighteen taels and two qian of gold were found. Wu Yingkai also revealed that although Tong Fengheng had nominally changed from a gold shop to a paper, cigarette, and kerosene shop since liberation, it was actually still secretly selling gold and silver. Because they feared being discovered on West Riverbank recently, they had made an agreement with De Fengheng to melt and trade here. Afterwards, the police went to Tong Fengheng to investigate, only to find the house in a mess, with the safe wide open, and the shop's manager and primary offender, Huang Jiecai, had fled upon hearing the news. The First Police Station, in addition to sending the arrested perpetrators, twenty-eight taels and two qian of gold, and gold melting and selling tools to the branch bureau for processing by the court, is continuing its investigation.

    以转业作幌子
    非法买卖黄金
    两铺店被查获法办
    【本报讯】前门外煤市街一一○号德丰恒纸烟煤油店及西河沿七号同丰恒纸烟煤油庄（原系金店转营）以卖纸烟为名，互相勾结进行金银买卖，已为外二分局查获，交法院处理。上月十四日，外二分局第一派出所接人民银行电话，告知德丰恒有买卖金银嫌疑。当晚九时，该所所长李宗燎协同警士十人前往查对户口，进门后见经理神色失常，各伙友亦皆面面相觑，所长即请到后院查看。发现该号后院南屋有伙友郝继英、武英楷正在用火炉风箱熔化黄金，当在化金槽中取出尚未熔化的黄金十锭，从地下检起金镯一只，再返前院找询经理曹祝华，该犯已乘机逃逸。后经分别询问伙友，知郝武二人均系西河沿同丰恒伙友，系到此给德丰恒化金，并指出西屋屏山后有一小洞，以及沙发下面、南屋梁上均为该号平日存放金银之所。经检查后，又发现黄金十八两二钱，武英楷又说出同丰恒自解放后虽名义上将金店改为纸烟煤油庄，实际仍是私自捣卖金银。因近日在西河沿怕人发觉，特与德丰恒相约，在此熔化买卖。事后警士前往同丰恒查看，只见屋内东西狼籍，保险柜大开，该号经理主犯黄洁臣已闻风逃走。第一派出所除将已获人犯及黄金二十八两二钱，化金、卖金用具一并送往分局交法院处理外，尚在继续侦察中。
