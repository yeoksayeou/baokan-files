Cao Zhilin said: "From the government work report, we can see that the People's Government has done many things for the people in the midst of difficulties. After the meeting, we should call on everyone to unite under the leadership of Chairman Mao, support the front through production, and build a new Beijing for the people." Worker representative Yan Shizhong said: "We must eliminate special agents in factories to ensure the smooth progress of production. As railway workers, we must not only implement the resolutions of the congress and conserve resources to support the front, but also strengthen railway transportation and break the enemy's blockade." Hao Shumin expressed that she would definitely bring the valuable experience back to the factory after the meeting, increase production, and complete the liberation war as soon as possible. Farmer representative Gao Ming said: "We must increase production to support the front and completely uproot Chiang Kai-shek, so that our lives will be better." Student representative Wu Pu said: "We are able to hold a democratic congress here because the People's Liberation Army fought for it and the workers created it with their hands. We must go back and study, study, and study again to be good students of Chairman Mao."
    Meng Zhaojiang, representative of the primary and secondary school teachers' union, guaranteed the congress on behalf of 6,000 primary and secondary school teachers in the city: They are determined to earnestly implement the congress's resolutions on education and serve the workers and peasants wholeheartedly. Qian Duansheng, representative of the college and university teachers' union, said: "Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, even greater success of this meeting is expected. We will definitely implement the resolutions of the congress for the sake of the two million citizens and work together with all citizens to ensure that Chairman Mao receives the most pleasant letter when he receives the citizens' letters again!" Army representative Zhang Naigeng assured the congress that in the second half of the year, they would cooperate with the public security organs to eliminate special agents in order to consolidate the revolutionary order in Beijing, while also conserving resources and developing the People's Liberation Army's fine tradition of hard work and simplicity, and assisting the government in promoting and carrying out adult education and economic construction and health work. Ethnic minority representative Ma Yuhuai said: "This congress is not only a congress of ethnic unity but also a congress of ethnic equality." Private industrial and commercial representatives all unanimously stated that they had gained a deeper understanding of the Communist Party's policy of uniting the national bourgeoisie through this congress, and they were determined to work hard for the economic construction of New Democracy. Chen Yintang, manager of Dahua Pottery Company, said: "We must use idle capital to invest in production." Zhang Xianting, manager of Lihua Soy Sauce Company, said: "From now on, our private factories should step up production to support the front and stabilize prices. National capitalists should set up more factories to solve the problem of worker unemployment. Labor and management should unite and cooperate to make the quality of products good and the cost low, and build Beijing into a production city." Tang Yongtong, professor at Peking University, said: "This congress is a congress of unity, and it considers issues from a comprehensive perspective. This is precisely the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, a true manifestation of being close to the people." Lian Kuoru, representative of the performing arts circle, said: "The previous Kuomintang reactionaries' Senate was telling lies, but now our people's representatives are telling the truth." Subsequently, worker representative Xiao Ming delivered the closing speech, he emphasized that according to Chairman Mao's most valuable instructions to us, the current consultative conference of representatives from all sectors should transition to the People's Congress, the highest organ of power, and pool our efforts to solve the problems existing in the people's economic life. He further pointed out that in overcoming difficulties and building our new political, cultural, and economic life, we will learn from the advanced socialist country of the Soviet Union's experience in carrying out construction under extremely difficult conditions and rapidly restoring and developing industry after the brutal Second World War. At the same time, we are also willing to learn from the Soviet Union's example of building their beautiful capital, Moscow, to build our new capital of a great power of 475 million people. At this point, music was melodious, applause resounded, and all the representatives shouted:
    Long live the victory of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress!
    Long live the successful construction of New Beijing!
    Long live the unity of all democratic classes, all democratic parties, and all democratic groups!
    Long live the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live Chairman Mao!
