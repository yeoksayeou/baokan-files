Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 13th. Workers in state-owned enterprises in Shenyang, Changchun, Mudanjiang and other places are stepping up production to greet the fourth anniversary of the liberation of Northeast China on "August 15th." Workers in various branches of the Shenyang Vehicle Factory voluntarily repaired a broken boiler and one locomotive and one coal water car during their spare time. They also manufactured a milling machine and other machines and parts. The tram factory repaired six discarded vehicles, preparing them for commissioning on the "August 15th" anniversary. Workers at the Changchun Electric Power Administration have launched a production competition to greet "August 15th." The 18 workers in the Administration's line team arrived early and left late, working in the rain to bury 38 high and low voltage power poles in three days during the construction of the special line for the Ministry of Military Industry. The six-member meter dismantling team in the internal line section, which used to dismantle 70 meters a day, increased it to 100 during the competition. The power plant workers have also formulated plans to increase mechanical efficiency to the standard of the puppet Manchukuo, implement a dedicated responsibility system, eliminate accidents, and strengthen fire prevention and anti-espionage, in order to complete the grand competition to welcome "August 15th." All the workers of the Mudanjiang Thermal Power Plant decided to strive for collective meritorious service in the "August 15th" competition, eliminating accidents, ensuring uninterrupted power supply and no gas leaks for even a minute, and ensuring that not a single screw or a drop of oil is wasted. Special-class labor model Na Xishan is determined to create a transformer and a winding machine to greet "August 15th." Workers at the water source of the water plant will ensure constant water supply and save electricity and fuel. In addition, workers in enterprises and factories in various places are enthusiastically preparing various entertainment activities to commemorate "August 15th."
