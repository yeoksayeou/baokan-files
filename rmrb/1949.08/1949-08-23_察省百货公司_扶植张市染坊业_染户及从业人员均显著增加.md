　　Chahar Province Department Store
  　Supports Zhangjiakou Dyeing Industry
  　Number of Dyeing Households and Employees Significantly Increases
    [Zhangjiakou News] During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the Zhangjiakou dyeing industry had only twenty households, and business was extremely sluggish, with each household having no more than five or six people. After liberation, with the support of the Chahar Province Department Store, the number has now increased to thirty-three households, with 231 employees. The number of households has increased by 65 percent, and the number of people has increased by 131 percent. The main method of support is to provide white cloth and dyes. Initially, dyeing was done sporadically. Later, the dyeing workshops were divided into six groups according to the streets, and the group leaders took the cloth from the company and distributed it to the dyeing households. However, some group leaders were selfish, dyeing more for themselves and distributing less to others; and they were not responsible for inspection, resulting in uneven quality of the dyed cloth. After review, the method was changed to free combination, and group leaders were democratically elected. In addition to stipulating that distribution should be reasonable, it was also determined that assistance could be stopped for any household that did a poor job of dyeing. This stimulated the competitive spirit of the dyeing workshops, improved technology, and ensured a certain quality. The dyeing workshops have a high morale for production, and output has increased month by month. A total of more than 350 bolts were dyed in April and May, and the number surged to more than 6,100 bolts in June. As of August 10, a total of 15,853 bolts of cloth have been dyed.

　　察省百货公司
  　扶植张市染坊业
  　染户及从业人员均显著增加
    【张市讯】张市染坊业，在国民党反动派统治时，仅仅二十家，生意极其萧条，每家多不过五、六人。解放后，经察省百货公司扶植，现已增至三十三家，从业人数二百三十一人，户数增加百分之六十五，人数增加百分之一百三十一。扶植办法，主要是供给白布和染料。开始时零星染，后来将各染坊按街道分成六个小组，组长将布由公司取回，分配给各染户，但有的组长自私自利，自己染的多，给别人家分配的少；而且不负责检查，使染出的布好坏不等。后经检讨，改为自由组合，民主推选组长，除规定分配要合理外，同时确定谁家染的不好，即可停止扶助。这样刺激了各染坊的竞争心，提高了技术，保证了一定的质量。各染坊生产情绪很高，产量逐月增加，四、五月份共染三百五十余匹，六月份突增至六千一百余匹，截至八月十日，共染布一五、八五三匹。
