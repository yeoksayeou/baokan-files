　　Chinese Social Scientists
  　Hold Symposium on U.S. White Paper
    Comrade Lin Boqu Hopes to Expose U.S. Imperialist Conspiracy from Historical, Philosophical, and International Law Perspectives
    [Our dispatch] The preparatory committee for the Chinese Social Scientists Representative Conference held a symposium at the Beijing Hotel yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to discuss the White Paper on China released by the U.S. State Department. Those present included Lin Boqu, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Deng Chumin, Li Da, Hou Wailu, Wu Enyu, Zhang Xiruo, Zhang Zhirang, Lou Bangyan, Qian Duansheng, Chen Yuan, Hu Yuzhi, Zhang Xueyan, Liu Liangmo, Ke Yongnian, He Sijing, and more than fifty others. Comrade Lin Boqu, the chairman, first delivered a speech, saying: Since the U.S. imperialists released the White Paper on China, various democratic parties and people's organizations have refuted it one after another. Today, we hope that everyone can further expose the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to invade our country from various aspects such as history, philosophy, and international law, and help the broad masses of Chinese people recognize the true face of the United States. Following this, Mr. Liu Liangmo and Mr. Zhang Xueyan, who had just returned from the United States, and Mr. Du Renzhi, Qian Duansheng, Yang Gang, Ke Bonian, Deng Chumin, He Sijing, Zhao Chengxin, Zhang Xiruo and others spoke successively.
　　Liu Liangmo
    Mr. Liu Liangmo said: After returning to China this time, seeing that the motherland is about to be completely liberated and the sunshine of freedom will soon shine on the land of new China, I feel unspeakably happy. Then, based on what he saw with his own eyes, he explained that U.S. imperialism is just a paper tiger, and the economic crisis is becoming increasingly imminent. According to U.S. official statistics, there are currently five million fully unemployed people. If the underemployed are included, there are a total of nine million unemployed. It is estimated that the number of fully unemployed people will increase to eight million in the second half of this year. He said: After the U.S. imperialists suffered a disastrous defeat in their large-scale interference and aggression against China, they are now proposing to use so-called "democratic individualists" in a vain attempt to continue to oppose the Chinese people, but as long as we strengthen internal unity, this conspiracy of the United States can be easily crushed.
　　Zhang Xueyan
    Mr. Zhang Xueyan pointed out in his speech: Those who have really been to South America and the slums of the United States will realize that the essence of so-called American prosperity is only that a few people enjoy it as much as possible, while the vast majority of working people still live in poverty.
　　Du Renzhi
    Mr. Du Renzhi said: We not only express our indignation at the White Paper, but more importantly, we should further expose and smash the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to continue its aggression against China. In order to accomplish this goal, we must quickly carry the Liberation War through to the end, strengthen the work of uniting, winning over, and educating the so-called "democratic individualists," consolidate Sino-Soviet friendship, strengthen our internationalist education, and practice strict economy in order to smash the U.S. imperialist blockade against us.
　　Qian Duansheng
    Mr. Qian Duansheng emphasized in his speech: We must break any illusions about U.S. imperialism today.
　　Yang Gang
    Ms. Yang Gang said: To defeat the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to continue its aggression against China, our main force should be placed on strengthening the power of the people at home. Following this, Mr. Ke Bonian, Mr. Zhang Xiruo, and others spoke, hoping that social scientists would strengthen the work of uniting, winning over, and educating the so-called democratic individualists, and continue to further study the White Paper from historical, legal, and philosophical perspectives in the future, in order to systematically expose the historical facts of U.S. aggression against China. The speakers believed that intellectuals who had long received Anglo-American capitalist education should particularly strengthen their studies, work hard to transform themselves, and firmly establish a position of serving the people.

　　中国社会科学工作者
  　座谈美帝白皮书
    林伯渠同志望从历史、哲学和国际法方面揭露美帝阴谋
    【本报讯】中国社会科学工作者代表会议筹备会，于昨日午前九时假北京饭店举行座谈会，讨论美国国务院所发表的对华白皮书。到会者有林伯渠、沈钧儒、郭沫若、邓初民、李达、侯外庐、吴恩裕、张奚若、张志让、楼邦彦、钱端升、陈垣、胡愈之、张雪岩、刘良模、柯永年、何思敬等五十余人。首由主席林伯渠同志致词，他说：自从美帝国主义者发表了对华白皮书后，各民主党派各人民团体都纷纷加以驳斥，今天我们希望大家能从历史、哲学和国际法等各方面，去进一步揭露美帝国主义侵略我国的阴谋，帮助广大中国人民认识美国的真面目。接着先后发言者有刚从美国回来的刘良模、张雪岩两先生和杜任之、钱端升、杨刚、柯柏年、邓初民、何思敬、赵承信、张奚若诸先生。
　　刘良模
    刘良模先生说：这次回国后，看到祖国快要全部解放，自由的阳光即将普照着新中国的土地，感到说不出的高兴。接着他以亲眼所见的事实来说明：美帝国主义只是一只纸老虎，经济危机已日趋迫近，据美国官方统计，现已有五百万全失业者，若把半失业者加在内，一共有九百万人失业，估计今年下半年全失业的人数将增加到八百万。他说：美帝国主义者在大规模地干涉和侵略中国遭到惨败后，现在又提出要利用所谓“民主的个人主义者”，妄想继续反对中国人民，但只要我们加强内部团结，美国的这一阴谋是不难粉碎的。
　　张雪岩
    张雪岩先生在讲话中指出：真正到过南美和美国贫民窟去看过的人，他会认识到：所谓美国的繁荣的实质只不过是少数人尽量享受，广大劳动人民则仍然过着贫苦的生活。
　　杜任之
    杜任之先生说：我们对于白皮书不仅表示愤慨，更重要的是应进一步揭穿并粉碎美帝国主义继续侵华的阴谋。为了完成这一目的，我们必须迅速把解放战争进行到底，加强团结、争取和教育所谓“民主的个人主义者”的工作，巩固中苏友谊，加强我们的国际主义教育，并厉行精简节约，以粉碎美帝对我们的封锁。
　　钱端升
    钱端升先生在讲话中，特别强调指出：我们今天要打破对美帝国主义的任何幻想。
　　杨刚
    杨刚先生说：要击破美帝继续侵华的阴谋，我们的主要力量应放在增强国内人民力量方面。继有柯柏年、张奚若先生等讲话，希望社会科学工作者对于所谓民主个人主义者要加强团结、争取和教育的工作，并于今后继续从历史、法律、哲学等方面进一步研究白皮书，以便有系统地揭露美国侵华的史实。讲话的人们认为过去长期接受英美资本主义教育的知识分子，应特别加强学习，努力改造自己，以坚定为人民服务的立场。
