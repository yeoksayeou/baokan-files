Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 18th: Indonesian Guerrillas Bravely Resist the Dutch
　　 Fierce Battles in Java, Attacking Surabaya Area
　　 50,000 People in Batavia Demonstrate Against the Dutch
　　 [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 18th] The so-called "ceasefire order" issued by the Indonesian Hatta group and the Dutch authorities on the 3rd has passed half a month, and the Indonesian guerrillas continue to persist in and strengthen the anti-Dutch war. According to a TASS dispatch from Batavia on the 15th: Fierce battles continue between the Dutch colonial army and the Indonesian army. Recently, Indonesian patriots have been actively engaged in Java and other regions. The Indonesian army attacking the city of Solo has victoriously occupied several parts of the city. Armed conflicts have also occurred in Mojokerto and other cities. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Batavia, the Dutch official military situation bulletin issued on the 12th admitted: "Although the Republic of Indonesia (referring to the Hatta puppet government) is doing its best to maintain order and security, the activities of the communists in East Java are worrying," "The situation in some areas, especially the Sukani喘 and Pasuruan areas, remains uneasy." Another official Dutch communiqué issued in Surabaya admitted that guerrillas had attacked the Surabaya area.
　　 The continued fighting of the Indonesian guerrillas has greatly alarmed the US and Dutch imperialists and their running dog, the Hatta group. According to the US News Agency, the Central Joint Bureau, composed of representatives of the United Nations Indonesian Committee, the Hatta Group, and the Dutch side, manipulated by the United States, held its second meeting in Batavia on the 14th and instructed the local joint committees to immediately "investigate the events in eastern and central Central Java."
　　 [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 18th] Batavia News: The 17th was the fourth anniversary of the declaration of the establishment of the Republic of Indonesia. Ignoring the ban of the Dutch occupation authorities, 50,000 residents gathered in front of the former headquarters of the Republic of Indonesia on that day and held the largest demonstration in four years. Demonstrators resisted the suppression of armed gendarmes with sticks and angrily rushed into the office of the Dutch delegation, shouting: "We want freedom!"
　　 [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 18th] The Viet Minh army is strengthening its combat operations against the French aggressors. According to a TASS dispatch on the 16th: The Viet Minh army liberated Bac Kan (transliteration), 175 kilometers north of Hanoi, on the 9th. According to a Reuters dispatch from Saigon: The Viet Minh army bombarded the outskirts of Saigon on the evening of the 9th. At the same time, the French-occupied areas are increasingly unstable, and the resistance movement of the Vietnamese people is growing. According to a TASS dispatch on the 16th quoting Viet Minh Radio: The French military command attempted to defeat Vietnamese resistance by destroying rice paddies. In Nam Dinh Province, 50 miles north of Hanoi, French armored vehicles destroyed tens of thousands of acres of rice fields in a few weeks. In several provinces north of Hanoi, the French military authorities ordered women and children to forcibly remove rice seedlings. In some provinces, French military aircraft pilots were ordered to strafe Vietnamese farmers who were building dikes.

    巴达维亚五万人民反荷示威
    【新华社北平十八日电】印尼哈达集团与荷兰当局三日发布的所谓“停战令”已过去半月，印尼游击队仍继续坚持和加强抗荷战争。据塔斯社十五日电引巴达维亚消息称：荷兰殖民军与印尼军双方继续进行激战。最近印尼爱国者一直在爪哇等地区积极活动。进攻梭罗城的印尼军，已胜利地占领该城若干部分。武装冲突并在莫约克托及其他城市发生。另据法新社巴达维亚讯，荷兰官方十二日发表的一周军事情势公报承认：“虽然印尼共和国（按指哈达傀儡政府）尽力维持秩序与安全，但共产党在东爪哇的活动却堪虑”，“一些地区，特别是苏卡尼喘和巴苏鲁安地区的情况，依旧不安”。荷兰官方在泗水发表的另一公报承认：游击队曾攻入泗水地区。
    印尼游击队的继续奋战，使美、荷帝国主义及其走卒哈达集团大为惊慌。据美新闻处讯，由美国操纵的联合国印尼委员会、哈达集团及荷方等代表组成的监视印尼游击队执行“停战令”的中央联合局，十四日在巴达维亚举行第二次会议，训令地方联合委员会，立即“调查中爪哇东部及中部之事件”。
    【新华社北平十八日电】巴达维亚讯：十七日是印尼共和国宣布成立四周年纪念日，此间五万居民不顾荷兰占领当局的禁令，于当日群集前印尼共和国总部门前，举行了四年以来最大的示威游行。示威者用棍棒反抗武装宪兵的弹压，并愤怒地冲入荷兰代表团的办事处，他们高呼：“我们要自由！”
    【新华社北平十八日电】越盟军加强对法国侵略军的作战活动。据塔斯社十六日讯：越盟军已于九日解放河内以北一七五公里的巴坎（译音）城。另据路透社西贡讯：越盟军于九日晚曾炮轰西贡郊外。同时，法军占领区日益不稳，越南人民的反抗运动正在增长中。据塔斯社十六日电引越盟广播称：法军指挥部企图以破坏种米场的手段，来击败越南人的抵抗。在河内以北五十哩的南定省，法军装甲车在数星期内压坏成千累万亩的稻田。在河内以北若干省内，法国军事当局下令强迫妇女、小孩们铲去稻秧。在若干省内，法军飞机驾驶员奉命向正在修筑河堤的越南农民扫射。
