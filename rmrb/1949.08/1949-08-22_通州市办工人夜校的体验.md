　　In order to develop worker education in our city, we first conducted thorough preparation among the workers in various factories. On the principle of conscious voluntarism, a worker's night school was established in late April with forty workers. Based on the work hours of the various factories and the opinions of the workers, it was decided that classes would be held for one hour every evening from Monday to Friday. On the first day of school, a discussion was held with the students, and a learning system was established: guaranteeing no absences, no tardiness, and striving to be learning models. The curriculum focused on politics, supplemented by recreation. In the process of learning, we integrated it with the workers' demands related to their vital interests, such as wage issues and dismissal issues. This greatly improved the workers' enthusiasm for learning and also influenced the workers who had not yet joined the night school, who all requested to study. Now the number of students has increased to one hundred and fifty-six. Based on the workers' level of education, they are divided into political classes and cultural classes. Because students are admitted at any time, and there is a lot of mobility, we experienced a winding road over the past month due to our lack of experience and suitable teaching materials. The following are our experiences and opinions on running the night school:
    I. In terms of teaching methods and teaching materials, we must constantly solicit the opinions of the workers and take into account their level of education and degree of comprehension as a direction for improvement. For example, they reflected that the lectures should be slower, and more writing should be done on the blackboard, etc. In addition, at the beginning of the class, there were phenomena such as being scattered, not paying attention, holding small meetings, and eating snacks. We mobilized activists and let the workers hold their own learning review meetings. Through everyone's thinking, it was quickly corrected. In short, everything must be discussed with the workers, and commandism and rash advances will not work.
    II. First of all, workers should understand the nature of night school and why workers need to study. In addition, attention should be paid to contacting the capitalists of private factories to eliminate the idea of opposition to workers' learning. At first, we systematically explained the relationship between the working class and the capitalists, the creation of the world by labor, and other issues. This explanation had a great effect. Later, we talked about "A Brief History of Social Development", but the workers were not interested in the evolution of apes and ancient primitive society. The workers expressed the hope that we would talk about practical issues and basic revolutionary issues. Now the political class is studying "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and current affairs, while the cultural class is using the literacy textbook of the Dazhong Daily. For recreation, we learn to sing every Friday. The workers love to sing, so appropriate recreational activities greatly encourage the workers' learning enthusiasm. In addition, when explaining, we should grasp the central meaning, and patiently and systematically explain it repeatedly, in a simple and understandable way, and relate the problems to the workers' daily life. Strive for quality in progress, and do not be greedy for more.
    III. Due to lack of experience and suitable teaching materials, we initially grabbed everything at random, and the comrades who gave lectures did not cooperate enough with each other. Therefore, there was no proper plan for the teaching materials, the process was not systematic, and the study groups in various factories were not established, so they could not cooperate with the night school. Therefore, the effect achieved in the past month was very small.
    IV. The workers' night school is the best place to unite the workers, making the workers in this city further develop class love. For example, when a female worker's husband died and she did not have burial expenses, the workers in the night school generously donated six or seven thousand yuan. Active elements can be found from the workers' night school to become the backbone of the trade union. Because the workers' class consciousness has been improved, they have participated in the government's call in all aspects. For example, the heads of the Xin Street Village regime in this city are mostly workers who have been elected.

　　通州市办工人夜校的体验
    为了开展本市的工人教育，事先我们在各工厂的工人间进行了充分的酝酿，在自觉自愿的原则下，有四十名工人于四月下旬成立了一所工人夜校。根据各工厂的工作时间和工人们的意见，规定在星期一至星期五每晚学习一小时。开学的头一天，和学员们开了个讨论会，建立了学习制度：保证不缺席、不迟到和争取学习模范。教材以政治为主，文娱为辅。在进行学习的过程中，我们把工人切身利益要求结合在一起，如工资问题，解雇问题等。这样就大大地提高了工人们的学习情绪，也影响了未入夜校的工人，一致要求学习。现在学员已增至一百五十六名，根据工人的文化程度又分为政治班与文化班。因随到随收，流动性很大，一个月来由于我们没有经验和缺乏适当的教材，是经过了一段曲折道路。以下是我们办夜校的经验和意见：
    一、在教学方法上和教材上，要时时征求工人的意见，照顾工人们的文化程度和消化的程度作为改进的方向，例如他们反映讲课说话时要慢一点，多在黑板上写字等。此外最初上课时有散漫、不注意听、开小会、吃零嘴等现象。我们发动积极分子，让工人们自己开学习检讨会，通过了大家的思想，很快地纠正了。总之一切都要和工人们商量用命令式和急冲锋是行不通的。
    二、首先应使工友们了解夜校的性质和工人为啥需要学习，此外应注意与私营工厂资方采取联系，消除与工友们学习对立的思想。我们最初有系统地讲解了工人阶级与资本家的关系，劳动创造世界等问题，这样讲解收的效果很大。后来又讲“社会发展简史”，但工友们对猿人变化和上古原始社会都不感兴趣，工友们意见希望讲现实问题和革命基本问题。现在政治班学习“中国革命与中国共产党”和时事，文化班采用大众日报的识字课本。文娱方面每周星期五学习唱歌。工友们都爱唱歌，所以适当的文娱活动对工友们的学习情绪是有很大的鼓舞作用。此外讲解时应抓住中心意思，耐心有条理的反复讲解，深入浅出，把问题引证到工人日常生活上。进度求精，不要贪多。
    三、由于没有经验和缺乏适当教材，最初形成乱抓一把，讲课的同志互相配合上也不够，所以对教材没有适当计划，进程也没有系统、各工厂的学习小组也没建立起来，因此与夜校不能互相配合，所以一个月来收的效果很小。
    四、工人夜校是团结工人最好的场所，使本市的工友更进一步的发挥了阶级友爱，譬如一个女工丈夫死了，没有埋葬费，夜校的工友们都慷慨地捐助了六、七千元；从工人夜校能发现积极分子成为工会的骨干，由于工友们的阶级觉悟提高，在各方面都参加了政府的号召，如本市的新街村政权，街长大部是工人当选了。
