　　On the U.S. Imperialist Policy Toward China
　　Ke Bonian
　　Open Door, Contending for Opportunities to Exploit China
　　The U.S. imperialist policy toward China has consistently been an aggressive policy.

　　Doesn't U.S. imperialism often use its Open Door policy to prove its traditional friendship with China?

　　This is the old trick of U.S. imperialist propaganda!

　　U.S. Secretary of State John Hay presented a note to other imperialist countries on September 6, 1899, advocating the Open Door policy in China. It recognized the spheres of influence or spheres of interest of various imperialist countries as established facts, but was only worried that this would "endanger the rights guaranteed to the United States by treaties with China," and only hoped that "the interests of the American people will not be discriminated against." Therefore, the U.S. demands were only: (1) In any so-called sphere of interest or leased territory in China, there must be no interference with treaty ports or any investment undertaking; (2) All goods loaded and unloaded at these ports, regardless of their origin, shall pay the same customs duties to the Chinese government; (3) Ships entering and leaving shall pay the same dockage fees, regardless of their origin, and the freight rates for goods on railways built and operated by any country shall also be equal for all countries. This is the entire content of the Open Door policy.

　　It can be seen that the Open Door policy only demanded that the United States have equal commercial opportunities in the spheres of influence or spheres of interest of other countries. In other words, the United States demanded equal opportunities with other imperialists to exploit the Chinese people.

　　It can be seen that U.S. imperialism did not advocate abolishing the exploitation of China, but rather maintaining the exploitation of China; it only opposed the sole exploitation by one imperialist in a certain sphere of influence.

　　It can be seen that the Open Door policy not only has nothing in common with the interests of the Chinese people, but is directly opposed to them!

　　Capricious, Once Attempted to Seize Leased Territories

　　Doesn't U.S. imperialism also often use its advocacy of the administrative and territorial integrity of China to prove its traditional friendship with China?

　　This is also the old trick of U.S. imperialist propaganda!

　　2,500 U.S. imperialist armed forces participated in the Eight-Nation Alliance (19,000 men) to attack Beijing, massacring the Chinese people—the Boxers—who resisted imperialist oppression and exploitation. On July 3, 1900, U.S. Secretary of State John Hay telegraphed other imperialist countries, declaring that the U.S. policy was to seek a solution "whereby permanent safety and peace may be secured to China, preserve Chinese territorial and administrative entity, protect all rights guaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and international law, and safeguard for the world the principle of equal and impartial trade with all parts of the Chinese Empire." This was a reiteration of the Open Door policy, the main content of which was still: protecting vested treaty privileges and maintaining equal trade opportunities. However, because it added the phrase "preserve Chinese territorial and administrative entity," it seemed as if it was of great benefit to China. In fact, U.S. imperialism only said an empty phrase, and soon went back on its word!

　　Don't believe it? Please look at these two ironclad facts:

　　The first thing: Hay ordered the U.S. Minister to China in November 1900 to ask the Qing government to give Sansha Bay in Fujian Province to the United States as a naval base and leased territory. Japan opposed this request from the United States, telling the United States: Didn't the United States once declare that it would not use the Boxer Rebellion as an opportunity to expand its territory? Moreover, Fujian is Japan's sphere of influence; the U.S. request infringes on Japan's treaty rights. This attempt by U.S. imperialism was not realized due to Japan's opposition.

　　The second thing: Tsarist Russia took advantage of the Boxer Rebellion to send troops into Manchuria and discriminated against U.S. commerce. Hay once negotiated with the Russian Ambassador to the United States, Cassini, and he said to Cassini: If Russia continues to do this, other powers will have to seize other provinces of China as well! The ambition of U.S. imperialism can be seen from this.

　　It can be seen that U.S. imperialism once wanted to participate in the partitioning of China, and in fact, it did attempt to acquire Sansha Bay as a naval base and leased territory. U.S. imperialism has repeatedly said that the United States has never had territorial ambitions in China, which is a blatant lie to the world!

　　Ingratitude, Excluding Overseas Chinese

　　Doesn't U.S. imperialism often use how good it is to the Chinese people to prove its traditional friendship with China?

　　This is another old trick of U.S. imperialist propaganda!

　　Chinese workers have made great contributions to the development of the American West. In the mid-19th century, the American West was sparsely populated and lacked labor, encouraging foreign workers to immigrate to the United States. When gold mines were discovered in San Francisco in 1848, there were only about 50 Chinese workers in the United States, which increased to 90,000 by 1868. The Sino-American Treaty of 1868 still stipulated that the people of the two countries could travel freely. The overseas Chinese in the United States were concentrated in the states along the West Coast, initially working as miners or opening laundries, retail stores, or restaurants in mining towns. Later, as the mining industry declined, the United States was building a transcontinental railroad, and most of the Chinese workers turned to working as coolies building the railroad, engaging in this most arduous work. With the completion of the railroad, the industry and commerce of the American West became developed. The number of overseas Chinese in 1900 was more than 89,000.

　　Chinese workers made great contributions to the development of the American West; but the United States repaid kindness with ingratitude, tearing down the bridge after crossing the river. When the U.S. economic panic cycle came, there was a surplus of labor, and workers suffered the pain of unemployment. The bourgeoisie then incited white workers to oppose Chinese workers, saying that Chinese workers were taking away their jobs. They undermined the solidarity of the working class and attributed the capitalist crime—unemployment—to Chinese workers, and Chinese workers became scapegoats. U.S. politicians, in order to win votes, listed "excluding the Chinese" as campaign platforms in several presidential election campaigns in 1876, 1880, and 1888 by both the Democratic and Republican parties. The anti-Chinese sentiment stirred up by these capitalists and politicians caused the overseas Chinese in the United States to suffer heavy persecution.

　　The U.S. Congress passed a ten-year ban on Chinese workers entering the country several times in 1880, 1888, and 1894. By 1904, it simply passed a bill indefinitely banning Chinese workers from entering the country.

　　Non-labor Chinese, although allowed to enter the country, were treated in the following way: "When Chinese people arrive at a port, regardless of whether they are legal or not, they are imprisoned in wooden shacks at the dock. They eat and sleep there, completely isolated from the outside world. Relatives and friends are not allowed to see them, and lawyers are not allowed to ask questions. Even if they are sick, doctors are not allowed to see them. The darkness and filth are worse than a prison. The oppression and cruelty are worse than that of criminals. Hundreds of people are often imprisoned, and they are detained for several months, while their passports are shelved, and the customs officials do not even ask about them. Because of this, there are tragic cases of people hanging themselves, drowning themselves, and dying due to lack of medical treatment." (A petition to the Qing government from 56,000 Chinese merchants in various ports of the United States in the 27th year of the Guangxu reign, Cui Zijian, et al.)

　　The situation of those overseas Chinese who were already in the United States was: "Wherever there are Chinese people, they are often beaten severely, but there is nothing they can do. The police arrest people arbitrarily, without distinguishing between good and bad, and they are heavily fined. Restaurants forbid Chinese people from eating, hotels forbid Chinese people from staying, theaters forbid Chinese people from watching, houses forbid Chinese people from renting, hospitals forbid Chinese people from being treated, and elementary schools forbid Chinese people from entering. All kinds of cruelty, we Chinese people see and experience, know it but dare not speak, speak it but dare not argue." (Ibid.)

　　It can be seen that ingratitude, excluding Chinese workers, and discriminating against Chinese people are the specific contents of U.S. imperialism's so-called "friendship" toward the Chinese people!

　　Resisting American Goods—The Chinese People's Way of Struggle

　　The eyes of the broad masses of the Chinese people are sharp, and they have clearly seen the ferocious true face of U.S. imperialism.

　　The U.S. Congress passed a bill in 1904 indefinitely banning Chinese workers from entering the country, which angered the broad masses of the Chinese people who were anti-imperialist. Since the corrupt government of the Qing Dynasty was unable to protect the interests of the Chinese people, the broad masses of the people who were anti-imperialist used economic boycotts to carry out the struggle against U.S. imperialism. This was the first large-scale organized boycott movement of the Chinese people. In 1904 and 1905, widespread boycott movements occurred in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Hankou, Tianjin, and other places. Merchants from all over participated in this anti-U.S. imperialist movement.

　　U.S. imperialist consuls in various places protested to the governors-general in various places, demanding that the movement to boycott American goods be banned. However, because this movement was so widespread, some governors-general of the Qing government did not dare to suppress it, but dared to refuse the unreasonable demands of the U.S. consuls. For example, Cen Chunxuan, the Governor-General of Liangguang, replied to the note from the U.S. Consul in Guangzhou: "The discussion of resisting American goods is actually caused by righteous indignation, which is the same heart of China and foreign countries, and it is not unique to Guangdong Province. And the Chinese workers in the United States, especially those from Guangdong, so the public sentiment is even more urgent. ... As for whether merchants and people buy American goods or not, it must be free. This governor-general can only order his subordinates to persuade them, but cannot forcibly ban them. And it is a matter of civilian trade, which has nothing to do with international affairs. The letter suddenly referred to it as a breach of contract and demanded compensation on the pretext that American merchants could not sell their goods. May I ask if there is such a principle in the world? This governor-general does not understand it and wishes the distinguished consul-general to think about it carefully."

　　However, Yuan Shikai, the Governor-General of Zhili, flattered U.S. imperialism, took drastic action, suppressed the local anti-American goods movement, and telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Qing Dynasty, asking it to order the governors-general in various places to vigorously suppress this movement. The Chinese people's first large-scale anti-imperialist boycott movement was thus suppressed.

　　The iron fact that the broad masses of the Chinese people once used the anti-American goods movement in the early 20th century to oppose U.S. imperialism's bill to exclude Chinese workers is enough to expose the myth of U.S. imperialism's traditional friendship with China.

　　The Nine-Power Treaty, a Scrap of Paper

　　Doesn't U.S. imperialism often mention the Washington Nine-Power Treaty to prove its traditional friendship with China?

　　This deceptive propaganda can be seen through at a glance.

　　The Washington Nine-Power Treaty of 1922 stipulated that the contracting countries (except for China) should abide by several principles: (1) Respect China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity; (2) Give China the fullest and most unobstructed opportunity to develop and maintain an effective and consolidated government; (3) Use their influence to effectively establish and maintain the principle of equal commercial and industrial opportunities for all countries in all parts of China; (4) Never take advantage of the Chinese situation to seek special interests that may infringe upon the rights of subjects or people of friendly countries, and shall not encourage actions that endanger the safety of friendly countries.

　　The actual content of this grand treaty is still the Open Door, equal opportunity, and still guarantees U.S. imperialism has equal opportunities to carry out exploitation in all parts of China.

　　The most loudly publicized article, "Respect China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity," is purely a lie. Since U.S. imperialism and the other seven countries refused to give up all the special rights granted to them by past unequal treaties, specifically, refused to give up extraterritoriality, concessions, leased territories, inland navigation rights, the right to station troops in the Tianjin-Beiping area, etc., China could not have complete sovereignty, true independence, nor territorial and administrative integrity. Since they wanted to maintain all the special rights granted by unequal treaties, they could not respect China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity. In other words, if they truly respected China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity, they would have to give up all the special rights granted by unequal treaties; and this is what U.S. imperialism was unwilling to do.

　　The purpose of U.S. imperialism, as Stimson later said in his letter to Borah in 1932, was for the Nine-Power Treaty to "guarantee the rights and interests of all contracting countries in China." Therefore, the actual meaning of the phrase "respect China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity" was just to maintain China's status quo at that time, in other words, its oppressed and exploited semi-colonial status.

　　The Nine-Power Treaty was not even effective in maintaining China's semi-colonial status quo. As a result of the uneven development of capitalism, Japan created the Mukden Incident in 1931 and occupied the four northeastern provinces. This clearly violated the Nine-Power Treaty. Did U.S. imperialism come out to actually uphold the Nine-Power Treaty? No. U.S. imperialism only issued the "non-recognition doctrine." What did U.S. imperialism not recognize? What U.S. imperialism did not recognize were only those that affected "any situation, treaty, or agreement of the United States government and the American people's rights in China." (Stimson's letter to Borah)

　　It can be seen that U.S. imperialism launched the Nine-Power Treaty, not really for China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity, but for its own vested interests in China.

　　Sitting on the Mountain to Watch the Tigers Fight, Supplying Japan with Military Supplies to Fight China

　t U.S. imperialism often hypocritically claim that it helped China resist Japan, to prove its traditional friendship with China?

　　This deceptive propaganda has long been exposed by the facts!

　　In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, U.S. imperialism adopted a policy of sitting on the mountain to watch the tigers fight. On the one hand, it supplied Japan with war materials, allowing Japan to fight well; on the other hand, it gave China a little bit of money, allowing China to fight well. It waited for Japan to get tired of fighting before interfering, ordering Japan to spit out part of the loot and dividing the loot equally with Japan under the slogan of the Open Door.

　　Take a look at the ironclad facts. Since the July 7th Incident, the war materials imported by Japan mainly came from the United States. The percentage of U.S. military supplies exported to Japan in Japan's foreign trade was as follows:

　　1937　　　　　　　　　　　33.5%
　　1938　　　　　　　　　　　34.3%
　　1939　　　　　　　　　　　34.3%
　　1940 (First Quarter)　　　　　　38.7%

　　After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan in China, U.S. exports to Japan were mainly war materials. For example, in 1937 and 1938, the situation was as follows:

　　　　　　　　U.S. Total Exports to Japan　　　War Materials　　　Cotton　　　Other
　　1937　　289 (Million USD)　　　168　　　62　　　59
　　1938　　240 (Million USD)　　　159　　　53　　　28
　　Total　　　　　One Hundred Twenty Million USD

　　U.S. imperialism supplied Japan with oil, scrap steel, cotton, aircraft parts, and other military supplies, allowing Japan to use them to massacre Chinese anti-Japanese troops and people!

　　At the same time, U.S. imperialism gave the Kuomintang government the following loans, with an interest rate of 4% and a term of 5 to 7 years:

　　February 1939　　　　　　　25 Million USD
　　April 1940　　　　　　　20 Million USD
　　October 1940　　　　　　　25 Million USD
　　February 1941　　　　　　　50 Million USD

　　(If compared with the Soviet Union, there is a very obvious difference. The Soviet Union lent the Chinese government a total of 250 million USD from March 1938 to June 1939, which is twice as much as the United States. The conditions were also more lenient than those of the United States, with an interest rate of only 3% and a term of 7 years and 3 months to 12 years and 4 months.)

　　In this situation, the United States sat on the mountain and watched China and Japan fight. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the United States repeatedly launched a Far East Munich Conference, but it was unsuccessful due to the resolute opposition of the Chinese Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the broad masses of the people. Representatives of the United States and Japan also attempted to negotiate how to sacrifice China and how to divide the spoils in order to resolve the contradictions between the United States and Japan. However, because the negotiations on the division of the spoils failed, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, and the United States was forced to become China's ally.

　　　　Forced to Become Allies, Wholeheartedly Assisting the Reactionaries

　　After U.S. imperialism was forced to become an ally in China's War of Resistance Against Japan, it knew very well that "since the United States entered the war, the Kuomintang clearly believed that Japan would eventually be defeated and saw an opportunity to improve its position in the final struggle with the CCP." "The government and the Kuomintang have apparently lost the crusading spirit that won them the loyalty of the people in the early days of the war. They have become corrupt, addicted to seizing positions and power, and relying on the United States to win the war for them and maintain their superior position at home." (Acheson's letter to Truman)

　　However, it still only gave aid to the Kuomintang government, and did not give any aid to the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army led by the Chinese Communist Party, which resolutely and bravely resisted Japan. Why? Because U.S. imperialism had already planned how to support the Kuomintang reactionary government to seize the fruits of victory after the end of the War of Resistance and carry out the anti-communist and anti-people war while the War of Resistance Against Japan was still going on! U.S. imperialism confessed: "U.S. officials... were concerned that this Kuomintang decline would inevitably affect its final political or military struggle with the CCP. They worried in 1943 and 1944 that the National Government might so alienate itself from the people that it would prove unable to maintain its power in the postwar competition for power." (Ibid.)

　　After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, U.S. imperialism did its best to "assist the National Government in establishing its authority in as much of China's vast territory as possible," "mostly because of the aid we gave their troops in transportation, armament and supply, they were able to extend their control over most of North China and Manchuria." (Ibid.)

　　It can be seen that after U.S. imperialism was forced to become an ally, it always supported the reactionary forces in China, consciously helping the Kuomintang bandit gang government to carry out the anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-democratic struggle after the victory of the War of Resistance, suppressing the Chinese New Democratic Revolution, and making China forever a colony of the United States.

　　U.S. imperialism is the enemy of the Chinese people. The Kuomintang bandit gang government and its army, which are fully supported by the United States, have now been basically eliminated, but the United States has declared that it will continue to support all reactionary forces and use various methods to oppose the Chinese people.

　　In summary: The U.S. imperialist policy toward China has always been a policy of aggression, a policy of exploitation, a policy of enslavement, and an anti-people and anti-democratic policy!

　　论美帝国主义的对华政策
    柯柏年    
　　门户开放，争的是对华剥削的机会
    美帝国主义底对华政策，一贯地是侵略主义的政策。
    美帝国主义不是常常以它的门户开放政策来证明其对华的传统友谊吗？
    这是美帝国主义底老一套的欺骗宣传！
    美国国务卿海氏于一八九九年九月六日向其他帝国主义国家提出照会，主张中国门户开放政策。它承认各帝国主义底势力范围或利益范围为既成事实，只是担心这会“危及美国与中国间的条约所保证给美国的权利，”只希望“美国人民底利益不受歧视。”所以，美国底要求，只是：（一）在中国任何所谓利益范围或租借地内之通商口岸或任何投资事业，无论如何，不得加以干涉；（二）在这些口岸装卸的一切货物，不论属于何国，均向中国政府完纳同一的关税；（三）进出的船舶，不论属于何国，付同一的码头税，不论何国所建造、经营的铁路，运费对各国货物也一律平等。这就是门户开放政策底全部内容。
    可见，门户开放政策只是要求在其他各国底势力范围或利益范围中，美国有均等的商业机会。换一句话说，美国要求与其他帝国主义有均等的机会从事剥削中国人民。
    可见，美帝国主义并不是主张废除对中国的剥削，而是主张维持对中国的剥削；它仅仅反对在某一势力范围内由某一帝国主义单独剥削。
    可见，门户开放政策与中国人民底利益不仅没有丝毫相同之点，而是正相反对！
    反复无常，曾经企图夺取租借地
    美帝国主义不是也常常以它主张中国行政和领土底完整来证明其对华的传统友谊吗？
    这也是美帝国主义底老一套的欺骗宣传！
    美帝国主义底武装力量二千五百人，参加了八国联军（一万九千人）进攻北京，屠杀中国底反抗帝国主义压迫和剥削的民众——义和团。一九○○年七月三日，美国国务卿海氏致电其他帝国主义，声明美国底政策是要找求一种解决“俾可在中国获得永久之安宁与和平，保持中国底领土的和行政的完整，保障一切由条约和国际法所保证的权利，并保护全世界在中国各地均等公正贸易底原则。”这是重申门户开放政策，主要内容仍然是：保护既得的条约特权，维持均等的贸易机会。不过，因为多说了“保持中国底领土的和行政的完整”这一句话，仿佛对中国就有多大好处似的。其实，美帝国主义只说了一句空话，不久也就食言自肥！
    不信么？请看下面这两件铁的事实：
    第一件事：海氏于一九○○年十一月命令美国驻华公使向满清政府要求把福建省的三沙湾给美国为海军基地和租借地。日本反对美国这个要求，告诉美国说：美国不是曾经宣称不利用义和团之乱，作为扩张领土之机会吗？况且，福建是日本底势力范围；美国底要求，侵犯日本底条约权利。美帝国主义这一企图因遭日本反对而未实现。
    第二件事：帝俄乘义和团之乱，进兵满洲，对美国商业加以歧视。海氏有一次与帝俄驻美大使加辛尼交涉，他对加辛尼说：如果俄国继续这样干下去，其他列强也只好把中国别的省份也据为己有了！美帝之野心，由此可见。
    可见，美帝国主义是曾经想要参加瓜分中国的，而且，实际上也确曾企图取得三沙湾为海军基地和租借地。美帝国主义屡说美国历来对华并无领土的野心，真是撒天下之大谎！
    忘恩负义，排斥华侨
    美帝国主义不是又常常以它对中国人如何如何好，来证明其对华的传统友谊吗？
    这又是美帝国主义底老一套的欺骗宣传！
    中国工人对于美国西部底开发，有极大的功劳。在十九世纪中叶，美国西部地广人稀，缺乏劳动力，鼓励外国工人移入美国。当一八四八年旧金山发见金矿的时候，在美国的华工只有五十人左右，至一八六八年增为九万人。一八六八年的中美条约，仍规定两国人民得自由往来。在美国的华侨，集中于西海岸诸州，开始是当矿工，或在矿区的市镇开设洗衣作、或零售店、或菜馆。后来，矿业衰落，美国正在建筑横贯大陆的铁路，华工乃大都转为建筑铁路的苦力，从事这一最艰苦的工作。铁路筑成，美国西部底工商业才告发达。华侨人数，在一九○○年有八万九千多人。
    华工对美国西部底发展，实有绝大的贡献；但美国却以怨报德，过了河儿便拆桥。美国经济恐慌周期来临的时候，劳动力过剩，工人饱尝失业底痛苦。资产阶级乃鼓动白种工人反对华工，说华工抢去他们底饭碗。破坏了工人阶级底团结，又把资本主义底罪恶——失业——归因于华工，华工成为赎罪羔羊。美国政客，为争取选票，在一八七六年、一八八○年、一八八八年的几次总统选举运动中，民主党与共和党都把“排斥华人”列为竞选纲领。被这些资本家及政客所煽动起来的排华风潮，使留美的华侨遭受惨重迫害。
    美国国会于一八八○年、一八八八年、一八九四年，几次通过禁止华工入境十年法案。至一九○四年，简直通过无限期禁止华工入境法案。
    非劳工的华人，虽许入境，但他们所受的待遇，是这样的：“华人到埠之时，不问其合例与否，即囚之于马头木屋中。寝食于斯，内外隔绝。亲友不得一见，律师不得一问。即有疾病，医生亦不得诊视。黑暗秽臭，过于监狱。压制苛暴，甚于犯人。幽禁常数百人，羁留常数阅月，而护照束阁，关吏无一过问。因此之故，有悬梁自缢，投海自尽，失医致毙之惨者。”（光绪二十七年寓美各埠华商崔子肩等五万六千人致满清政府禀）
    那些已在美国的华侨，他们的处境是：“凡埠中华人，辄遇痛殴，亦无如何。巡差任意拿人，良歹不分，即遭重罚。餐馆则禁华人之饮食，客店则禁华人之止宿，戏园则禁华人之观看，房屋则禁华人之租赁，医院则禁华人之养病，小学校则禁华人之入学。种种惨毒，我华人皆目视而身受之，知之而莫敢言，言之而莫敢与校。”（仝上）
    可见，忘恩负义，排斥华工，歧视华人，就是美帝国主义对待中国人民的所谓“友好”底具体内容！
    抵制美货—中国人民底斗争方式
    中国广大民众底眼睛是雪亮的，他们看清楚了美帝国主义底凶恶的真面目。
    美国国会于一九○四年通过了无限期禁止华工入境法案，激怒了中国底反帝的广大民众。满清的腐败政府既无能力保护中国人民底利益，反帝的广大民众乃以经济抵制，来进行反美帝的斗争。这是中国人民第一次大规模的有组织的抵制运动。在一九○四年和一九○五年，广州、上海、福州、厦门、汉口、天津、以及其他地方，发生了广泛的抵制运动。在这一次的反美帝运动中，各地商人都参加。
    各地美帝国主义领事向各地总督抗议，要求取缔抵制美货运动。可是，因为这运动是如此广泛，以至满清政府的有些总督不敢压迫，而反敢拒绝美国领事底无理要求。例如，两广总督岑春萱答复广州美领事照会说：“查抵拒美货之议，实因激于义愤而起，中外同心，不独粤东一省为然。而旅美华工，尤以粤人为多，故众情更为迫切。……至商民购用美货与否，必须出于自由。本部堂只能饬属解劝，不能强加禁勒。且系民间贸易之事，与国际无干。来文乃遽指称背约，并以美商不能将货出售，藉端索偿。试问环球各国有无此等公理？本部堂意所未喻，愿贵总领事官一细思之。”
    可是，直隶总督袁世凯却向美帝国主义讨好，采取激烈行动，把当地的抵制美货运动镇压下去，并电满清外务部请其命令各地总督用力镇压这个运动。中国人民底第一次大规模的反帝的抵制运动，就这样地被镇压下去。
    中国广大民众在二十世纪初期曾经以抵制美货运动来反对美帝国主义底排斥华工法案，这一铁的事实，就足以戳穿美帝国主义底对华传统友谊之神话了。
    九国公约，废纸一张
    美帝国主义不是常常提到华盛顿九国公约来证明其对华的传统友谊吗？
    这种欺骗的宣传，一眼就可看穿。
    一九二二年的华盛顿九国公约规定了缔约各国（除中国外）遵守几项原则：（一）尊重中国底主权、独立、领土与行政的完整；（二）给予中国圆满无阻的机会以发展，并维持一有效巩固的政府；（三）运用它们的势力以求有效地成立及维持世界各国在中国全境的商工业机会均等之原则；（四）决不利用中国局面以觅取各项足以侵害友邦臣民或人民的权利之特殊权益，并不得奖掖有碍友邦安全的行动。
    这一冠冕堂皇的公约，其实际内容，仍然是门户开放，机会均等，仍然是保证美帝国主义有在中国全境进行剥削的均等机会。
    宣传得最有声色的“尊重中国底主权、独立、领土与行政的完整”这一条，纯粹是一句谎话。美帝国主义与其他七国，既不肯放弃过去不平等条约所给予它们的一切特殊权益，具体地说，既不肯放弃治外法权、租界、租借地、内河航行权、平津地区驻兵权等等，中国就不能有完全的主权，真正的独立，也不会有领土与行政的完整。既要保持一切由不平等条约所给予的特殊权益，就不能尊重中国底主权、独立、领土与行政的完整。换句话说，如果真正是尊重中国底主权、独立、领土与行政的完整，就一定要放弃一切由不平等条约所给予的特殊权益；而这是美帝所不愿的。
    美帝国主义底目的，诚如后来史汀生在一九三二年致波拉的信中所说，是要九国公约“保证一切缔约国在中国的权力和利益，”因此，尊重中国底主权、独立、领土与行政的完整这句话，其实际意义，就只是维持中国在当时的现状，换句话说，就是被压迫被剥削的半殖民地位。
    九国公约连维持中国底半殖民地的现状，也没有效力。资本主义发展不平衡底结果，日本于一九三一年制造了沈阳事变，占领东四省。这显然违犯九国公约。美帝国主义有没有出来实际维护九国公约呢？没有。美帝国主义只发表了“不承认主义”。不承认些什么呢？美帝国主义所不承认的，只是那些影响及“美国政府与美国人民在中国的权利之任何局势、条约、或协定。”（史汀生致波拉信）
    可见，美帝国主义发动九国公约，压根儿就不是真正为着中国底主权、独立、领土与行政的完整，而是为着美国自己在中国的既得的权益。
    坐山观虎斗，供给日本军需打中国
    美帝国主义不是常常丑表功地说它如何帮助中国抗战，来证明其对华的传统友谊吗？
    这种欺骗的宣传，早已被事实揭穿了！
    美帝国主义在中国抗日战争初期，是采取坐山观虎斗的政策。它一面供给日本以战争物资，让日本好打仗；另一面又接济中国一点点钱，让中国也好打仗。它等待着日本打累了，才出来干涉，勒令日本吐出一部分赃物，在门户开放口号之下，同日本均分赃物。
    看一看铁的事实吧。自芦沟桥事变以后，日本所输入的战争物资，主要是来自美国。美国对日军需输出占日本对外贸易百分比如下：一九三七年　　　　　　　　　　　三三·五％一九三八年　　　　　　　　　　　三四·三％一九三九年　　　　　　　　　　　三四·三％一九四○年（第一季）　　　　　　三八·七％
    在中国抗战发生后，美国对日输出，是以战争原料为主。例如一九三七年和一九三八年，情形如下：
　　　　　　　　美对日总输出　　　战争原料　　　棉花　　　其他一九三七年　　二八九（百万元）　　　一六八　　　六二　　　五九一九三八年　　二四○（百万元）　　　一五九　　　五三　　　二八共计　　　　　一亿二千万元
    美帝国主义就是这样地以石油、废钢、棉花、飞机零件等等军需供给日本，使日本好用来屠杀中国抗日军队和人民！
    同时，美帝国主义又给国民党政府以下列贷款，利息四厘，时期自五年至七年：一九三九年二月　　　　　　　二千五百万元一九四○年四月　　　　　　　二千万元一九四○年十月　　　　　　　二千五百万元一九四一年二月　　　　　　　五千万元
    （如果与苏联比较起来，就有很明显的不同。苏联在一九三八年三月至一九三九年六月，共贷给中国政府二亿五千万元，比美国多一倍。条件也比美国宽大，利息只有三厘，时期自七年三个月至十二年四个月。）
    在这种情况下，美国就坐在山头，观看中日两国打仗。美国在中国抗战初期，曾屡次发动远东慕尼黑会议，但因中国共产党、八路军新四军，以及广大民众之坚决反对，不能成功。美日两国代表也曾企图谈判如何牺牲中国，如何分赃，以解决美日间的矛盾。但因分赃谈判不成，日本袭击珍珠港，美国被迫地成为中国底盟国。
    　　　　被迫成盟国，一心一意助反动
    美帝国主义被迫成为中国抗日战争的盟国之后，它明知“自从美国参战后，国民党显然深信日本终将击败，并看出有一个机会来改进它的地位，以和中共作最后斗争。”“政府与国民党显然已失掉在抗战初期使他们赢得人民忠诚的十字军精神。他们已经堕落，沉醉于夺取地位、权利，依赖美国为他们赢得战争，保留他们在国内的优越地位。”（艾奇逊致杜鲁门信）
    可是，它仍然只把援助给予国民党政府，而对于中国共产党所领导的坚决英勇抗日的八路军和新四军，却没有给予丝毫援助。为什么呢？因为美帝国主义在抗日战争尚在进行的时候，就已打算如何扶助国民党反动政府在抗战结束后窃取胜利果实，进行反共反人民的战争了！美帝国主义自供道：“美国官员……关切国民党的这种每况愈下，势必影响到它最后与中共政治或军事的斗争。他们在一九四三年及一九四四年便担心国民政府可能如此自绝于国人，以致在战后竞争权力时证明它竟无力能维持其权力。”　　　（同上）
    抗战胜利后，美帝国主义就尽力“协助国民政府尽可能在中国广大的地区上建立它的权威，”“大部分由于我们在运输、武装和补给上给予他们的部队的援助，他们逐能推广其控制及于华北和东北的大部分。”（同上）
    可见，美帝国主义被迫成为盟国之后，它始终是支持中国的反动势力，有意识地帮助国民党匪帮政府在抗战胜利后进行反共、反人民、反民主的斗争，镇压中国的新民主主义革命，使中国永远成为美国底殖民地。
    美帝国主义是中国人民底敌人。美帝所全力支持的国民党匪帮政府及其军队，现在已基本被消灭了，但美帝已声明它将继续支持一切反动势力，用各种方法，来与中国人民反对。
    总结一句话：美帝国主义底对华政策，始终是侵略的政策，剥削的政策，奴役的政策，反人民、反民主的政策！
