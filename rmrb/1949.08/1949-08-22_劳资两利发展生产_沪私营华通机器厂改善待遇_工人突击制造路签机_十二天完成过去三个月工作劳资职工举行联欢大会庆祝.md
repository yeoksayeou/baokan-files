　　Labor-Capital Cooperation Promotes Production
  　Shanghai's Private Huatong Machine Factory Improves Treatment
    Workers Rush to Manufacture Railway Signal Machines
    Twelve Days to Complete Work That Previously Took Three Months; Labor, Management, and Employees Hold Celebration
    [Report from this newspaper] Shanghai's private Huatong Machine Factory, based on the correct principle of "labor-capital cooperation, developing production," resolved labor-capital disputes, and production efficiency greatly improved. This factory is the second largest in the Shanghai West District machine industry, with a total of more than 490 employees, specializing in the manufacture of motors, electric shelters, and other electrical products. In the three months before the liberation of Shanghai, workers' monthly wages were about 1.8 dan of rice, and life was relatively hard, resulting in low production morale. After liberation, workers felt that under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, workers suffered and dared not speak up. Now, everything cannot only focus on the factory's side; workers' treatment should also be appropriately improved. Therefore, the workers proposed that the basic monthly salary be calculated at the rate of four sheng of rice per yuan. However, the factory felt that the expenditure was huge and could not be afforded. As a result, a labor-capital dispute occurred in the factory.
    After a detailed investigation by the factory's trade union preparatory committee and the work group, both believed that the labor's demands were not high, and they hoped that the capital side could meet this reasonable demand from the labor side. They also suggested to the capital side: if the treatment of the labor side is appropriately improved, it can be guaranteed to improve workers' production morale. At this time, the Ministry of Railways ordered twelve railway signal machines (items used in locomotives) from the factory, priced at 9 million RMB, to be completed within 28 days. The order started on June 8th, but because the salary issue was not resolved, workers' labor morale was not high. According to past experience, this batch of goods would take at least three months to complete. The capital side was quite anxious. The trade union preparatory committee and the work group seized this opportunity to continue to persuade the capital side. With the assistance of the General Labor Union, the capital side finally agreed to the workers' demands. However, the capital side put forward a condition: if production cannot be improved, wages for the following month must still be reduced. This condition was also accepted by the workers.
    By the time the dispute ended, it was already eight days past the order date. The trade union preparatory committee and the work group held a mass meeting of workers to explain the policy of labor-capital cooperation and developing production, and to explain the political significance of manufacturing railway signal machines—in the past, they were manufactured for the Kuomintang reactionaries; now, the workers are manufacturing machines for their own government. Making them early can enable the rapid exchange of materials between Shanghai and other cities, which can lower prices and send materials far away to support the front lines, quickly liberating all of China. The workers' labor attitude was therefore changed, and production morale soared. Under the enthusiastic labor of all the workers, the work that previously took three months was successfully completed in twelve days, and it was even two days ahead of the delivery date. This successful rush was something that engineers and designers could not have imagined, and the factory was very excited. In the past, manufacturing twelve railway signal machines required 4,500 workdays. Calculated without increasing wages, each workday required 6 sheng of rice, totaling 270.5 dan of rice. Now, with increased wages, each workday increased to 1 dou, but only 1,500 workdays were needed to complete the task, totaling 150 dan of rice. After the wage increase, the capital side actually saved 120 dan of rice. Calculated at the then price of 30,000 yuan per dan of rice, the capital side made a net profit of 3.6 million yuan in wages, which was something the capital side had never encountered before. After the work was completed, the capital side took the initiative to invite the trade union preparatory committee to hold a labor-capital-employee celebration to celebrate this glorious achievement, which was obtained because of the correct implementation of the policy of "labor-capital cooperation, developing production."

　　劳资两利发展生产
  　沪私营华通机器厂改善待遇
    工人突击制造路签机
    十二天完成过去三个月工作劳资职工举行联欢大会庆祝
    【本报讯】上海私营华通机器厂，根据“劳资两利，发展生产”的正确方针，解决了劳资纠纷，生产效率大大提高。该厂为上海西区机器业中的第二个大厂，职工共有四百九十多人，专门制造马达、电力方棚等电器用品。上海解放前三个月，工人一个月工资约一石八斗，生活较苦，生产情绪低落。解放后，工人感到以前在国民党反动派统治下，工人受苦不敢说话，现在一切不能只顾厂方，也应该适当的提高工人待遇，于是工人提出工资（月薪）一元底薪照四升米计算；但厂方觉得支出浩大，不能负担。因而该厂劳资纠纷发生。
    该厂工会筹委会和工作组详细调查之后，都认为劳方的要求不高，希望资方能满足劳方这一合理要求，并向资方提出：如果适当的提高劳方待遇，那么，保证能提高工人生产情绪。此时铁道部向该厂订制路签机（火车头用物）十二部，订价九百万人民币，须在二十八天内完成。六月八日开始订货，因工资问题没解决，工人劳动情绪总不高。按照以往的情形，这批货物最低也要三个月时间才能完成。资方颇为着急，工会筹委会和工作组遂抓紧这个时机，继续向资方说服，在总工会的多方协助下，资方终于答应了工人们的要求，但资方提出一个附带条件，就是如果生产不能提高，下月份薪资仍得减低，这条件也为工人所答应了。
    纠纷结束之时，已超过订货日期八天。工会筹委会和工作组召开了一个工人群众大会，说明劳资两利，发展生产的政策，并解释制造路签机在政治上的意义——过去是为国民党反动派制造，现在工人是为自己的政府制造机器，早日做好，可使上海和其他城市物资得以迅速交流，物价可以降低，并使物资远送支援前线，迅速解放全中国。工人们劳动态度因以改变，生产情绪高涨。在全体工人的热情劳动之下，十二天就胜利完成了过去三个月的工作，按交货日期计算，还提前了两天。这种热情突击的成功，实非工程师和设计师所能想到，厂方大为兴奋。过去制造十二部路签机要四千五百个工才能完成，以未增加薪资计算，每个工要六升米，合计共需工资二百七十石半；现在工资加了，每个工提高为一斗，但只需一千五百个工就完成了，合计共需工资一百五十石米。提高薪资后，却为资方节省了一百二十石米，以当时米价三万元一石计算，资方在工资上就获净利三百六十万元，这是资方从没遇过的事。工作完成后，资方主动请工会筹委会召开劳资职工联欢会，来庆祝这次因为正确执行了“劳资两利，发展生产”的政策而获得的光辉成绩。
