Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 5th -- Through the multifaceted efforts of the People's Government and state-owned trade organizations, the exchange of industrial and agricultural products between Shanghai and other regions of the Liberated Areas has become increasingly active. Since the opening of direct train service between Beiping [Beijing] and Shanghai, coal from the north has been continuously transported south, and the coal supply problem in Shanghai and other cities in the Yangtze River Delta has been resolved. A large quantity of soybeans from the Northeast has also arrived. Cotton from Hankou, wheat and soybeans from Shandong and northern Anhui, and rice from Wuhu and northeastern Jiangxi are also being organized and transported to Shanghai by trade companies from various regions, or are in the process of being loaded for shipment. Over the past month, the Central China Trade Corporation in Hankou has shipped four batches of cotton to Shanghai, totaling 3,151 bales. In late July, trade companies from various regions shipped grain and cooking oil to Shanghai, including over 20 million catties of wheat from Shandong, 6,200 bags of soybeans and 2,000 bags of rice from northern Anhui, 100,000 catties of rice from Jiangxi, and 8,000 bags of rice and rapeseed from Wuhu. The northern Anhui Trade Corporation also has 7,000 tons of rice, wheat, cooking oil, tobacco leaves, and cowhide being loaded for shipment to Shanghai. Meanwhile, trade companies from various regions are actively purchasing daily industrial goods in Shanghai and transporting them back to their respective regions. The Tianjin Department Store alone recently purchased 280 cases of goods in Shanghai, including rubber, hardware, enamelware, knitwear, and fiber, which were loaded onto trains on July 30th for shipment north. The northern Anhui Trade Corporation has also transported 700 bales of cotton yarn, 20,000 bolts of cloth, and 100,000麻袋 [gunny sacks] back to Bengbu. In addition, the Shanghai Trade Corporation is vigorously assisting private merchants in transporting and selling industrial products such as yarn and cloth to Tianjin, Xuzhou, Jinan, and other places in exchange for grain and cooking oil. Among them, Hengtai and five other companies have already exchanged for over 400 large barrels of raw oil. Over the past month, the supply of rice and other necessities in Shanghai has gradually become abundant. In addition, the East China Finance Department allocated over 22.3 million catties of rice to the Shanghai Trade Office last month for the purpose of exchanging for rubber shoes, towels, soap and other daily necessities to supply the front lines. The amount of rice rationed by the Shanghai Grain Company at parity prices in July increased compared to June, totaling over 137,800 *shi*, benefiting 689,000 workers, students, and public employees. With the new rice crop now on the market on both sides of the Yangtze River, the grain situation in Shanghai will soon be further improved.
