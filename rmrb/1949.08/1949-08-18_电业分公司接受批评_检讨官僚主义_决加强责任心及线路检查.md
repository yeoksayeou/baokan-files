　　Electric Power Branch Company Accepts Criticism
  　Reviews Bureaucracy
  　Resolves to Strengthen Responsibility and Line Inspections
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Following a series of electric shock incidents, the Peiping Branch of the North China Electric Power Company, after investigation by reporters from this newspaper and criticisms from relevant departments, the leadership of the branch company has conducted a review of the electric shock incidents of the past six months, both ideologically and in terms of work. They have proposed future prevention measures: First, in terms of leadership, the thinking of the old rulers still remains. They emphasize objective difficulties. "There was no thorough plan made beforehand, and there was a lack of inspection afterward. As a result, after the accident occurred, they adopted an irresponsible attitude, did not actively try to find ways to correct it, and pushed most of the responsibility onto the victims of the electric shock. Even when the fault was indeed on the company's side, they only resorted to legal solutions." This kind of thinking is extremely wrong. Second, "There is a lack of research and poor foresight. There was no high degree of attention paid to the fact that line failures must be more frequent during periods of continuous rain than usual. The company failed to raise awareness beforehand, conduct widespread publicity among the citizens, and discuss with relevant departments to pay proper attention to prevention. Instead, they adopted a speculative approach, muddling through. When situations arose, they became flustered and dealt with them temporarily. This is a serious erroneous way of thinking that should not be continued." The branch company then reviewed its work, believing that: on the one hand, the work lacked inspection, and they were negligent and careless, especially when repairing the lines near the Sino-French University, they did not completely cut off the power, which led to the death of Zou Jujiang due to electric shock. "This is mainly due to our lack of seriousness and caution in our work attitude, which led to this unfortunate event." On the other hand, there was a lack of regular and systematic employee education, and there were no specific instructions given when incidents occurred, so it was difficult for less skilled workers to ensure that problems did not occur in complex lines, and the company's leadership should be held responsible for this.
    In order to improve the above situation, the branch company proposed the following corrective measures for the future: (1) Overcome the bureaucratic work style of the leadership and eliminate the phenomenon of shirking responsibility, procrastination, and irresponsibility. (2) Strengthen employee education and improve the sense of responsibility for work with a spirit of being responsible to the country and the people. (3) Strengthen the maintenance of lines, carry out inspection and repair work in a planned and focused manner, and repair the parts that are most likely to be dangerous first within the scope permitted by the company's economic conditions, and contact various parties to help each other and carry out repairs in a timely manner after a failure occurs. (4) Conduct extensive publicity among all citizens to raise everyone's awareness and attention, and introduce some knowledge of emergency rescue after electric shock by the company.

　　电业分公司接受批评
  　检讨官僚主义
  　决加强责任心及线路检查
    【本报特讯】华北电业公司北平分公司在连续发生触电事件之后，经本报记者前往调查及有关部门提出批评，分公司领导方面已对半年的触电事件从思想上与工作上作了检讨，提出今后防止办法，第一、在领导上，还存留着旧统治者思想，强调客观困难，“事先没有提出周密的计划，事后又缺乏检查，以致发生事故后，采取不负责任的态度，不积极想办法纠正，把大部分责任推托到触电者身上，而过失的确在公司方面的，也只有诉诸法律去解决。”这种思想是极端错误的。第二、“缺乏研究，预见性差，没有高度注意霪雨期间线路故障必定比平时多，公司方面事前不能提高警觉，向市民作普遍宣传，向有关部门商讨妥为注意防范，而是采取投机取巧的办法，得过且过，遇到情况发生，则手忙脚乱，临时应付，这是一种严重的错误思想，不应再继续存在。”分公司继检讨了工作，认为：一方面，工作缺乏检查，疏忽大意，特别是修理中法大学附近的线路时，没有把电源完全断绝，以致邹巨江触电身死，“这主要的是：由于我们工作态度上不够严肃和谨慎，以致形成此次的不幸事件。”另一方面，缺乏经常有系统的职工教育，遇事又没有具体的指示，以致不太熟练的工人很难在复杂的线路中，保证不发生问题，这在公司的领导上应负责任的。
    为改进上述情况，分公司提出今后纠正办法：（一）克服领导上的官僚主义作风，消灭推诿拖延和不负责任的现象。（二）加强职工教育，以对国家、对人民负责的精神，提高工作责任心。（三）加强线路的维护，有计划有重点的进行检修工作，在公司经济条件许可范围内，先把最可能发生危险的部分即予修理，并与多方联系，互相协助，在发生故障后及时进行检修。（四）对全体市民进行广泛宣传，引起大家的警惕和注意，并由公司介绍一些触电后施行紧急救护的知识。
