Re-examining the Driving Force of Social Development
　　Deng Guogang
　　After reading "The Masses" (by Comrade Wang Ping) published in the "Study Life" column on August 11th and Comrade Song Dalei's critique of "The Masses" on the 16th, I feel that there are several issues in these two articles. First, what is wrong with Comrade Wang Ping's mistaken belief that "the masses" are the driving force of social development? Second, what is the relationship between "labor" and "the masses" as the driving force of social development?
　　"From ape to man and from primitive man to modern man, the only force on which development has relied in these millions of years is the masses." Comrade Wang Ping uses this answer to explain the "driving force of social development"; if we look at it superficially, it seems to be correct. His original intention may be good. However, adhering to the truth of materialistic dialectical science and the importance of this issue, we should ask, "Bees and ants both live in groups, why haven't they conquered nature and developed a social history?" Comrade Wang Ping already knew: "People used entire tribes to chase mammoths, not with one rifle, but with dozens of rifles stabbing into its hairy flanks. The crowd chases mammoths like a multi-handed and multi-legged creature." However, he focused on the entire tribe in this sentence, but did not pay attention to the dozens of rifles. He neglected the reason why humans can be multi-handed and multi-legged. In this way, he neglected "manufacturing tools" and "labor creating the world." Mr. Ai Siqi once said when lecturing on the history of social development: "If you want to ask how apes transformed into humans? You can get the answer by studying how apes learned to manufacture tools." Human hands were originally very soft, not comparable to the claws of beasts. If a large group of people relied solely on their bare hands, could they chase mammoths? Impossible, everyone knows there is a risk of death. So obviously, what can overcome the harm of nature to us is not because of "the masses" but because our hands can produce tools.
　　Emphasizing that the "masses" force enables human development blurs the distinction between humans and animals. "The difference between humans and animals lies in obtaining means of subsistence. It mainly does not rely on natural organs, but on man-made tools. Manufacturing tools, using tools to carry out labor production, and obtaining means of subsistence are the most fundamental differences between humans and animals."
　　We believe that "apes and those transformed from apes have always lived in groups." This statement is acceptable. But if we say: Because humans have this "masses" nature, there is human history. Then what is the difference from the lie that "the historical ideology of the exploiting classes often regards the ruling position of the exploiters as innate"?
　　M. Mitin once said in his historical materialism: "The contradiction between productive forces and relations of production is the driving force of every historical mode of production." Therefore, we can believe that Comrade Song Dalei's view that "labor" (production, mode of production) is the driving force of social development is without flaws.
　　Let us use Mr. Ai Siqi's words to make a counter-argument! "Without labor, there would be no humans. Without productive labor, there would be no human history."
　　But what is the relationship between "labor" and "the masses"?
　　Marx said it very clearly:
　　"In the process of production, people not only enter into relations with nature, but also enter into relations with each other. They cannot produce unless they combine in some way to carry out joint activities. In order to produce, people enter into certain connections and relationships. And only with the help of these social connections and relationships can people's influence on nature be generated, and can there be such a thing as production." It can be seen that the "masses" relationship of human beings is realized through production relations—joint labor and mutual exchange of each other's labor products. It is different from the "masses" relationship of ordinary animals. Therefore, from ape to man, there have also been some changes in the relationship of the masses.
　　Because the "masses" relationship of human beings is a production relationship, human beings can accelerate their progress in the process of social development. From resisting nature to transforming nature. But gregarious animals cannot exceed their animal boundaries by one step. Ants are still ants, bees are still bees, who is to blame for this reason? To blame them for not being a "gregarious" relationship of production relations, but a mob.
　　"Whether it is the development of production or the change of production relations, it must be realized through the power of millions of producers, through the power of the working masses. The invention of a new production tool and production technology, if it does not become a tool and technology mastered by tens of millions of workers, cannot be realized as a new social productive force. If a person engaged in a revolutionary movement does not mobilize millions of working masses to fight together, then his task, whether it is to destroy the old production relations or to establish new production relations, cannot be truly completed." We should believe that although "the masses" is not the driving force of social development, it plays a very large role in the process of production development. In particular, the power of the proletariat and working people, their ranks are the most distinct and organized, should be in a leading position. To unite the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, and the peasants with individualistic colors more "masses"-like, and exert greater power.
　　Being able to recognize the power of "the masses" in the process of production development is good, relying on the "masses" to oppose the "private" side, only in this way can the old historical view be overthrown; the lies of "true emperors" and "white tiger stars descending to earth" who create the world out of personal heroic whims can be negated. Who separates from the masses? Who will fall into the quagmire under everyone's feet, and let the giant wheel of the times roll over him.
　　Finally, I would like to mention again the purpose of studying the history of social development, not only to recognize that the power of the masses leads us to the "infinitely bright and infinitely wonderful communist society," but also to "understand the level of social productive forces in China today and the changes in production relations, understand the requirements of the Chinese workers and peasants for developing production, in order to decide appropriate guidelines and methods to mobilize the broad masses of workers, unite people of other classes, and jointly break the production relations that hinder the development of China's productive forces, establish new production relations, and carry the revolution through to the end."

### 再论社会发展的动力

　　再论社会发展的动力
    邓国刚
    看过了八月十一日“学习生活”栏发表的“群”（王坪同志作）和十六日宋大雷同志对“群”的批评以后，使我感到这二篇文章里有几个问题的存在。第一即王坪同志把“群”误认为社会发展的动力有什么错误？第二即社会发展的动力“劳动”和“群”又有什么样的关系？
    “从猿到人和从原始人到现代人，在这几百万年的过程中，所赖以发展的唯一力量是群。”王坪同志以这样的回答来说明“社会发展的动力”；我们如从表面上来看，似乎是对的。他的原意也许是好的。然而秉着唯物辩证科学的真理和这个问题的重要性，我们就应该追问“蜜蜂和蚂蚁都是过的群体生活，为什么没有征服自然，发展一部社会史呢？”王坪同志已知道了：“人们以整个部落去追逐猛犸，不是一根猎枪，而是几十根猎枪戳进它的毛茸茸的胁部。人群象多手多脚的生物一样去追逐猛犸。”然而他注意的是这句话的整个部落，却没有注意到几十根猎枪。忽略了人所以能多手多脚的原因。这样就把“制造工具”和“劳动创造世界”，而忽略艾思奇同志在讲授社会发展史时曾经说过：“要问猿怎样转变为人的？只要研究猿怎样学会制造工具，就可以得到答复了。”人类的手，原是很软的，抵不上猛兽的爪牙，假使单靠赤手空拳的一大群人就能追逐猛犸吗？不可能的，谁都知道有丧身的危险的。所以很明显的，能战胜自然界对我们的杀害，不是靠因为“群”而是靠我们的双手能生产工具。
    强调“群”力使人类发展，就要把人和禽兽的区别模糊起来。“人和动物不同的地方，就在于获取生活资料。主要不是依赖天然的器官，而是依赖人为的工具。制造工具、使用工具以进行劳动生产获取生活资料，是人和动物的最根本区别。”
    我们相信“猿及由猿变成的人，则是始终过着群的生活。”这句话是可以的。但如果说：因为人类有了这“群”的天性，所以就有人类的历史。那与“削剥阶级的历史思想，常常把剥削者的统治地位看做是天生的。”的谎话；又有何异呢？
    Ｍ·米丁在他的历史唯物论里曾经说过：“生产力和生产关系底矛盾是每一历史的生产方式底原动力。”因此我们可相信宋大雷同志把“劳动”（生产、生产方式）认为是社会发展的动力，是无甚瑕疵。
    让我们把艾思奇同志的话来做过反证吧！“没有劳动，就没有人类。没有生产的劳动，就没有人类的历史。”
    可是“劳动”和“群”又有什么关系呢？
    马克思说得很明白：
    “在生产底时候，人们不但对自然发生关系，而且自己相互间也发生关系。他们假使不采取某种方式结合起来，以进行共同的活动，他们就不能生产。为着要生产；人们就走进了一定的连系和关系。而且只有靠这些社会连系和关系底帮助，才会产生人们对自然的影响，才会有生产这会事。”可见人类的“群”的关系是经过生产关系——共同劳作和互相交换各自劳动生产物底帮助，才实现出来的。它与一般动物的“群”的关系不同。所以从猿变成人。在群的关系上，也经过一些变化。
    因为人类的“群”的关系是生产的关系，所以人类在社会发展的过程中，能加快速度前进。从抵御自然而改造自然。但是群居的动物就不能超过他们动物界线一步。蚂蚁还是蚂蚁，蜜蜂还是蜜蜂，这原因要怪谁呢？要怪它们不是生产关系的“群居”，而是乌合之众。
    “不论生产的发展或生产关系的改变，都是要经过千百万生产者的力量，经过劳动群众的力量来实现的。一种新的生产工具和生产技术的发明，如果没有成为千万劳动者所掌握的工具和技术，就不可能实现为新的社会生产力。从事一种革命运动的人，如果不动员起千百万的劳动群众来共同斗争，那么他的任务不论是破坏旧的生产关系或建立新的生产关系的任务，都不可能真正完成。”我们应该相信“群”虽然不是社会发展的动力，但在生产发展的过程中，却起着一个很大的作用。特别是无产阶级劳动人民的力量，他们的队伍最严明、最有组织，应该处于领导的地位。来把个人主义色彩的小资产阶级、民族资产阶级和农民团结得更“群”一点，发挥出更大的力量。
    能够在生产发展的过程中，认识出“群”的力量是好的，依靠“群”反对“私”的一面，这样才会把旧的历史观推翻；把“真命天子”“白虎星下凡”这一类个人英雄心血来潮创造世界的谎话否定。谁脱离群众吗？谁就要掉在众人脚下的泥淖里，让时代的巨轮从他身上滚过。
    最后我想再提一下学习社会发展史的目的，不仅要认识群的力量使我们走到“无限光明，无限美妙的共产主义社会”，而更要“了解今天中国社会生产力的水平以及生产关系改变的情况，了解中国工农劳动群众发展生产的要求是什么，以便决定适当的方针办法，来动员广大劳动群众，团结其他阶层人民，共同来打破妨碍中国生产力发展的生产关系，建立新的生产关系，把革命进行到底。”
