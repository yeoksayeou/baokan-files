    [Shenyang News] The gold and silver vendors in Shenyang, considering that the gold and silver business is of little benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and because the price of gold and silver in Northeast China has been stable in recent months, making it unprofitable to manipulate gold and silver, most of the gold and silver vendors have requested to change professions. There are three gold and silver vendor markets in the city, located in Shenhe, Heping, and Beishi districts, with more than 300 vendors. The Beishi gold and silver market, with a total of 45 vendors, requested to change professions at the end of last month, and Beishi was officially cancelled at the beginning of this month. The largest gold and silver market in the city, the Shenhe District gold and silver market, has more than 200 vendors, and more than 150 vendors have requested to change professions. The Heping District market has more than 60 vendors, and is also brewing changes in professions. To date, there are still 100 gold and silver vendors in the city who have not changed professions, accounting for only one-third of the original number.

    沈阳金银摊贩三分之二已改业
    【沈阳讯】沈市金银摊贩市场各业者鉴于金银业对国计民生无甚裨益，又因近月余来东北金银价格平稳，捣弄金银无利可图，大部金银摊贩，纷纷要求转业。全市共有沈河、和平、北市三个金银摊贩市场，有业者三百余户，北市金银市场共有四十五户，于上月底全部要求改业，本月初北市已正式取消。全市最大之沈河区金银市场有业者二百余户，要求改业者达百五十余户，和平区市场有业者六十余户，现亦正在酝酿改业。迄今全市尚未改业之金银摊贩业尚有一百户，仅占原户数三分之一了。
