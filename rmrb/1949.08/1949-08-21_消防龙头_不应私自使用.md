　　Fire Hydrants
  　Should Not Be Used Privately
    To the Editor:
    I have some opinions and would like to trouble you to answer them:
    People are stealing water from fire hydrants on the streets everywhere, which is a major loss to the country. How should the Beijing Water Company manage this?
    The water sold by pushcart vendors on the street may not be clean and could easily cause disease. Is the water company allowed to share water with users who have water meters? Can several households apply to install one water meter for shared use?
    Run Congwu
    Mr. Run Congwu:
    Regarding your questions about the private opening of fire hydrants and unauthorized use of water, we have received the following response from the Water Company:
    Regarding the frequent private opening of fire hydrants set up by our company and the unauthorized use of water, this is considered water theft, and our company prohibits it according to regulations. Because fire hydrants are set up for the city's fire safety, private opening and closing may damage the machinery and delay firefighting. Also, because the amount of water is being stolen, it invisibly increases the company's water price costs. Therefore, we hope that those who have made this mistake will automatically awaken and no longer open them privately. Our company will strengthen the inspection work on the one hand, and at the same time, we also ask all citizens to jointly advise those who improperly use fire hydrants and report to our company immediately.
    Regarding users with water pipes supplying water to those without, our company does not restrict it, but it must be handled according to the following circumstances:
    1. Users with water meters who wish to supply water to other households can register with our company.
    2. Users without meters who wish to supply water to other households can apply to our company for installation.

　　消防龙头
  　不应私自使用编辑同志：
    我有一些意见请您分神，代为解答一下：
    大街上防火用水管、到处都有人偷用，实为国家之一大损失。北平市自来水公司应怎样加以管理才好？
    街上推车卖水的水，恐不清洁，容易引起疾病，如与有水表的用户共用水，自来水公司是否许可？如数家共用一水表可否申请安装？
    润从五润从五先生：
    你所询问关于私开消防龙头，擅自用水等问题，承自来水公司答复如下：
    关于时常有人私开本公司所设消防龙头，擅自用水一节，专属窃水行为，本公司照章禁止。因消防龙头为本市消防安全而设，私自开闭恐损毁机件，耽误救火，又因水量遭受窃失，无形即是增高本公司水价成本。所以希望犯此错误的人自动觉醒，不再私开。本公司一方面加强稽查工作，同时并请全体市民共同对不正当使用消防龙头者，进行劝告，并即时向本公司报告。
    关于有水管用户供给无水管者用水，本公司不加限制，惟须照下列情形办理：
    １、凡装有水表之用户，如欲供给别户用水时，可来本公司登记。
    ２、无表用户，如欲供给别户用水时，可来本公司申请安装。
