Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 10th. The Central China Bureau of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of senior cadres from the directly subordinate organs of the Central China Region, Hubei Province, and Wuhan City on the 3rd. More than a thousand people attended the meeting, where Commander Lin Biao and Deputy Political Commissar Deng Zihui delivered speeches, calling for the launch of a streamlining and thrift campaign.

In his speech, Deputy Political Commissar Deng emphasized that the Central China Bureau had made the greatest determination to launch a large-scale streamlining and thrift campaign throughout the region. This campaign is essentially a rectification movement of the Party and should be persisted with to make it a regular system. Deputy Political Commissar Deng first explained that the purpose of launching the streamlining and thrift campaign is mainly to solve our current financial difficulties. Under the situation of the victorious development of the revolutionary struggle, although we have many favorable conditions, we also encountered many difficulties, the biggest of which is financial difficulty. If this difficulty is not resolved, it will affect the war-fighting capability and livelihood of the troops at the front, the people's lives and urban production, the relationship between the military and the people, and the unity between superiors and subordinates, affecting all aspects. All cadres should understand the country's financial difficulties. To this end, Deputy Political Commissar Deng reported on the current and future financial situation for the next year, using statistical figures to powerfully illustrate that because the war to eliminate the Kuomintang's remnant bandits must continue; because land reform has not yet been carried out, and the feudal forces-controlled countryside surrounds the isolated cities; because some cadres have developed serious extravagance and waste and a bad tendency to seek enjoyment after entering the cities; and because the bureaucratic enterprises left by the Kuomintang that we took over in the cities have not been rectified, the organs are bloated and huge, and business losses are extremely large, Central China's current finances are in a very difficult situation. Deputy Political Commissar Deng said: "But this is a local and temporary difficulty in the victorious situation, and it is completely surmountable. Every cadre should understand this difficulty and should understand that overcoming this local and temporary difficulty still requires a considerable amount of time. Therefore, we must make long-term plans ideologically." Deputy Political Commissar Deng pointed out that there are four ways to solve this difficulty: increase tax revenue, issue public bonds, issue currency, and streamline and economize. Deputy Political Commissar Deng said: "Relying on issuing currency to solve financial difficulties is the most dangerous. For the entire Central China region, our current currency issuance is not too much, but too little. However, because the money does not go to the countryside and is squeezed into the cities, it causes local inflation, which leads to price fluctuations and affects the basic masses' lives. Therefore, before the money goes to the countryside, we cannot continue to issue it in large quantities, let alone rely on issuing money to solve financial problems. Otherwise, the more money is issued, the higher prices will be. As a result, not only will financial difficulties not be resolved, but the social economy will be disrupted. This is the most dangerous method. Therefore, in the next few months, we must try our best not to issue, or at least issue less. As for tax revenue, because the masses' ability to bear it is limited, it must never be excessively increased. Therefore, the quickest, most effective, and most reliable method at present is to streamline and economize. Historical experience has proven that every time each liberated area encountered financial and economic difficulties in the past, it adopted this method, and each time it achieved good results. In the winter of 1947, when the East China battlefield was under key attack by the Kuomintang bandit army, only a few county towns were left in the area south of the Yellow River in Shandong, and the sea entrance was also blockaded, and financial difficulties reached the extreme. But because we implemented the streamlining and thrift campaign at that time, we not only overcame the difficulties in the end, but also accumulated the material basis for the counteroffensive. After listing examples of the North China, Northeast, and Northwest liberated areas implementing streamlining and thrift to overcome difficulties, he pointed out: The significance of the streamlining and thrift campaign, its role, is not only to solve financial difficulties; but only by implementing streamlining and thrift can a large number of cadres be drawn to work in the countryside, and only then can the extravagance and waste phenomena and the dangerous tendencies of caring about status and coveting enjoyment that exist among some cadres be overcome. If this tendency is not curbed, it will develop to the point where these cadres become corrupt and degenerate ideologically. He called on every cadre to maintain the Chinese Communist Party's fine tradition of hard work and plain living, and at the same time use this hard work and plain living style to influence social customs, establish the concept of taking plain living as glory and viewing extravagance and waste as shame among the masses, so as to achieve the goal of changing customs.

Next, Deputy Political Commissar Deng conveyed the preliminary requirements for streamlining and economizing in the resolution of the first meeting of the Central China Streamlining and Thrift Committee:

(1) Regarding streamlining staffing: (A) Streamline personnel. It is required that the directly subordinate units of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army be reduced by one-third, but the guard troops cannot be reduced. It is required that the directly subordinate units and organs of the Central China Bureau, the Provisional Government of Central Plains, and the municipal-level organs be greatly reduced. The reduction method is first to abolish unnecessary sections and offices, reduce levels, draw cadres to the countryside, and greatly reduce logistical personnel, and send them to the front or the countryside to work. All organs should adopt collective dining and collective office work as much as possible to reduce messengers and logistical personnel. Logistical personnel should be equipped in accordance with the configuration methods of hotels and teahouses. Feeders can be completely eliminated. In the past, cooks were equipped one for every twelve people, but today, in this collective environment, one can be equipped for every twenty-five to thirty people. All organ staffing should be changed in accordance with the conditions of urban concentration. (B) Streamline livestock. The Streamlining and Thrift Committee proposed that all organs in large and medium-sized cities abolish horseback riding, and communication horses should also be abolished and replaced with bicycles. Communication horses in the countryside should be preserved. The number of horses in the front troops should also be reduced as much as possible to avoid many difficulties in the south, which is not suitable for feeding horses, and to prevent livestock from dying. (C) Automobile staffing: Greatly reduce it in accordance with the provisions of the Interim Measures for the Use of Automobiles of the North China Bureau. (D) All carts of organs and troops in Wuhan will be abolished and replaced with automobiles. Carts and horse-drawn carriages in the front should also be abolished or reduced as much as possible and replaced with automobiles. (E) The number of local armed forces in each province should be limited, which should be determined by the General Staff Department of the military region in consultation with the military regions of each province. (F) The maximum limit should be set for the staffing of Party, government, civilian, and financial organs and cadre training in each province, and should not be increased arbitrarily. The amount should be determined by the Organization Department of the Central China Bureau in cooperation with the Provisional Government of Central Plains. (G) The funding for public schools and the number of publicly funded students in each province should be limited, which should be verified by the Propaganda Department of the Central China Bureau in cooperation with the Education Department of the Provisional Government of Central Plains. (H) Each province should concentrate its efforts on running one newspaper well. In Wuhan, it should concentrate its efforts on running the Yangtze River Daily well. Internal Party publications should also be limited to avoid duplication and waste of manpower, material resources, and financial resources.

(2) Regarding saving expenses: (A) Reduce supply standards: Central China is a newly developed area, and finances are difficult. The supply standards should not be the same as those of Northeast and North China. The Streamlining and Thrift Committee decided that six large units should each form a group of three to five people to study the supply standards of their respective systems. Finally, Zhou Chunquan, Xu Lin, and Fan Xingzhi convened the six group leaders to concentrate the opinions of each group and draft a unified Central China supply standard. (B) Limit the use of gasoline, water, and electricity: The above-mentioned drafting committee will stipulate the monthly consumption of gasoline for each car and the monthly consumption of water and electricity per person. (C) Limit entertaining guests: In general, no entertaining is allowed for personnel exchanges within the Central China region; for those from friendly regions and foreign guests who must be entertained, no more than six dishes and one soup are allowed. (D) Cancel special stoves, and there should be strict restrictions on medium and small stoves. The food in the large stoves should be improved. No meals are allowed at meetings. (E) Stop paying to watch operas, and the propaganda department will organize existing cultural troupes and opera troupes to perform in rotation. (F) Housing issues: Except for necessary factories and warehouses, no new houses will be built, no more private houses will be rented, and no more furniture will be purchased. For the existing housing of each organ, the Central China Bureau will designate a special person to organize a housing adjustment committee to be responsible for the adjustment. Those who can move to the suburbs should move out of the city as much as possible.

(3) Regarding production: (A) Promote spare-time labor. Under conditions where the environment permits, each unit can carry out production such as growing vegetables, raising pigs, extracting oil, and sprouting soybeans to improve meals. (B) The directly subordinate organs of the Field Army and the Central Bureau and the municipal-level organs will immediately organize organ consumer cooperatives to uniformly purchase the oil, salt, coal, vegetables, and other items needed by the personnel of each organ and to manufacture various office supplies themselves to reduce intermediate exploitation. However, strictly prevent engaging in business with the outside world and hoarding for speculation under the pretext of production.

(4) Regarding clearing up materials and transferring cash to the bank: (A) All materials stored in each unit shall be cleared, registered, and reported to the Logistics Department and the Financial Committee of the Field Army; (B) After registration, they will still be retained for use by each unit, and those that are too much will be adjusted individually by the superior organs; (C) All gold and silver stored in each unit shall be transferred to the bank, which will be converted at a 90% discount based on the actual market price and treated as a real-value deposit.

(5) Regarding launching the streamlining and thrift campaign in state-owned factories and financial and trade organs, the main thing is to mobilize and educate workers and staff to cherish the property of the people and the motherland, save raw materials and fuel, and protect machinery and equipment. If this work is not done well, the damage will be greater than any corruption and waste. In addition, attention should be paid to adjusting the structure to rationalize production organization in order to reduce costs and increase production.

In his speech, Deputy Political Commissar Deng finally pointed out that the streamlining and thrift campaign should be carried out from top to bottom. First of all, senior cadres are required to open their minds, set an example, and play a model role. In terms of regions, Wuhan should be done well first. Only in this way can superiors influence subordinates and promote the movement. Secondly, it is necessary to follow the mass line, mobilize the entire Party and army to get involved in this movement, and each unit must immediately carry out mobilization when it returns. The future reporting policy of the Yangtze River Daily and the Central China Branch of the Xinhua News Agency should take this as one of the central tasks. The numbers and methods and experiences of streamlining and saving by various organs should be published in the newspaper, which is also a report to the people. Good ones should be commended, and bad ones should be criticized.

Commander Lin Biao then spoke, and he particularly emphasized that the difficulties we encounter are fundamentally different in nature from the difficulties of the Kuomintang. The difficulties of the Kuomintang are the difficulties in defeat, which are fundamentally impossible to overcome; our difficulties are the difficulties in victory, which are local and temporary difficulties, which can be completely overcome. But the current difficulties are indeed very great and are real difficulties, which must not be ignored. Commander Lin continued: The Central China Bureau's proposal to launch the streamlining and thrift campaign is based on actual needs. For overcoming the current financial difficulties, streamlining and thrift is the fastest, most effective, and most reliable method, and it is also based on what is possible. In terms of tightening staffing and saving expenses, it is entirely possible to do it. In order to implement the various regulations in the Central China Bureau's instructions on streamlining and economizing, each unit must make precise numerical calculations. Plans, staffing, and inspection of results should be based on numbers. At the same time, the contract system should be adopted as a supplementary system to the supply system to achieve savings. Finally, Commander Lin pointed out that this streamlining and thrift campaign must become a storm-like mass movement, but it must not be allowed to fall into uncontrolled flow, and it will be over after a gust of wind. It must be persisted to become a regular system and a method to maintain our Party's style of hard work and plain living on a regular basis. Responsible comrades of various organs must personally grasp it, mobilize the whole Party from top to bottom, open their minds, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. The streamlining and thrift committees of various systems should become permanent institutions for leading this movement and conduct regular supervision and inspection.

    华中局召开高级干部会议
    开展精简节约运动
    林彪邓子恢号召大力贯彻
    【新华社汉口十日电】中共中央华中局于三日召开了华中区、湖北盛武汉市党政军直属各机关的高级干部会议。到会者达千余人，林彪司令员、邓子恢副政委在会上讲话，号召开展精简节约运动。
    邓副政委在讲话中强调指出：这次华中局下了最大的决心，要在全区开展一个大规模的精简节约运动。这个运动实质上是一个整党整风运动，应当坚持下去，使之成为经常制度。邓副政委首先说明：开展精简节约运动的目的，主要是为了解决我们当前的财经困难。在革命斗争胜利发展的形势下，我们虽然有着许多有利条件，但也遇到了许多困难，其中最大的是财经困难，这个困难不解决，将要影响前方部队的战争力和生活，影响到人民的生活与城市的生产，影响到军民关系与上下团结，影响到各方面。所有干部应该了解国家的这个财政困难。至此，邓副政委报告了目前及今后一年的财政状况，以统计数字有力地说明，因为消灭国民党残余匪帮的战争尚须继续进行；因为土地改革尚未能进行，封建势力所控制的农村，包围了孤立的城市；因为有些干部在进入城市后发生严重的铺张浪费，贪图享受的不良倾向；以及因为我们在城市接管的国民党遗留下的官僚主义的企业尚未整顿，机关臃肿庞大，营业亏损极巨等原因，华中目前的财政是处在极困难的状况下面。邓副政委说：“但这是胜利形势中的局部的暂时的困难，是完全可以克服的，每个干部应该了解这个困难，应该了解克服这个局部的暂时的困难仍需要相当时间。因此我们在思想上必须作长期打算。邓副政委指出解决这个困难的办法可以有四个：增加税收、发行公债、发行货币、精简节约。邓副政委说：“靠发行货币来解决财政困难是最危险的。就全华中区来说，目前我们的货币发行量不是太多，而是太少，但因为票子不下乡，挤在城市，却造成局部通货膨胀，以致引起物价波动，影响基本群众生活。所以在票子未下乡以前不能继续大量发行，更不能靠发行票子来解决财政问题。否则票子发行越多，物价将越高，结果不仅财政困难不能解决，反而把社会经济弄乱了，这是最危险的办法。因此在最近几个月内我们要做到尽量不发，至少是少发。至于税收，由于群众负担能力有一定限度，决不能过分增加。因此在目前最迅速、最有效、最靠得住的办法，就是精简节约。历史的经验证明：过去各个解放区每逢财政经济困难，便采用这个办法，每一次都收到良好的结果。一九四七年冬，华东战场受国民党匪军重点进攻时，山东黄河以南地区只留下几个县城，海口也被封锁了，财政困难到了极点；但由于当时我们实行了精简节约运动，最后不仅渡过了难关，而且还积蓄了反攻的物资基础。他在列举了华北、东北、西北各解放区实行精简节约、克服困难的实例后指出：精简节约运动的意义，其作用不仅在于解决财政困难；而且只有实行精简节约，才能抽出大批干部下乡工作，也才能克服目前若干干部中存在着的铺张浪费现象以及计较地位、贫图享受的危险倾向。这种倾向如不加以制止，便会发展到使这些干部贪污腐化、思想蜕化。他号召每个干部应保持中国共产党艰苦朴素的优良传统，同时以这种艰苦朴素作风去影响社会风气，在人民群众中树立以朴素为光荣、视奢侈浪费为耻辱的观念，达到移风易俗的目的。
    接着，邓副政委传达了华中精简节约委员会的第一次会议决议中关于精简节约的初步要求：
    （一）关于精简编制方面：（甲）精简人员。要求人民解放军第四野战军直属各单位缩减三分之一，但警卫部队不能缩减。要求华中局直属单位机关、中原临时人民政府及市一级机关大量裁减。缩减方法首先是裁并不必要的科处，缩减层次，抽出干部下乡，和大大裁减勤杂人员，派到前方或乡村去工作。各机关尽可能采取集体吃饭、集体办公，以减少通讯员及勤杂人员，应仿照旅馆茶房的配备办法来配备勤杂人员。饲养员完全可以裁撤。炊事员过去是每十二人配备一个，今天这种集体环境可以每二十五至三十人配备一个。一切机关编制应按城市集中的条件予以改变。（乙）精简牲口。精简节约委员会提议：在大、中城市里所有各机关骑马一律裁撤，通讯马也应裁撤，改用脚踏车。对乡村通讯马则应保存。前方部队之马匹亦应尽量裁减，以免在不适宜于喂养马匹之南方遭受许多困难并使牲口死亡。（丙）汽车编制：仿照华北局关于汽车使用暂行办法之规定，大大裁减。（丁）在武汉的机关部队所有大车一律裁撤，改配汽车。前方大车、马车亦应尽量裁撤或减少，改用汽车。（戊）各省地方武装人数应有限制，由军区参谋处与各省军区商定之。（己）各省党、政、民、财机关编制及干部训练应规定其最高限额，不得任意增加，其数额由华中局组织部协同中原临时人民政府规定之。（庚）各省公立学校经费及公费生人数应有限制，由华中局宣传部协同中原临时人民政府教育部核定之。（辛）各省报纸以集中力量办好一种报纸为好，在武汉则集中力量办好长江日报，党内刊物亦应限制，以免重复及浪费人力物力财力。
    （二）关于节省开支方面：（甲）减低供给标准：华中是新开辟的新区，财政困难，供给标准不应与东北、华北看齐。精简节约委员会决定由六个大的单位各组成一个三人至五人的小组，研究本系统供应标准，最后由周纯全、徐林、范醒之三人召集六个组长，将各组意见集中起来，起草统一的华中供给标准。（乙）限制汽油、水、电使用：由上述起草委员会规定每辆汽车每月汽油、及每人每月水电之用量。（丙）限制请客：凡华中区内部人员来往，一概不请客；友区来人及外宾必须请宴者，一律不超过六菜一汤。（丁）取消特灶，中小灶应有严格限制，大灶伙食应予改善。开会一律不会餐。（戊）停止出钱看戏，由宣传部门组织现有文工团、戏团输流演唱。（己）住房问题：除必需之工厂仓库外，不建造新房屋，不再租民房，不再买家具。现有各机关住房，由华中局指定专人组织房屋调整委员会负责调整。凡能移住郊外者尽可能移出城外。
    （三）关于生产方面：（甲）提倡业余劳动，在环境许可条件下，各单位可进行种菜、喂猪、打油、生豆芽等生产，以改善伙食。（乙）由野战军和中央局的直属机关及市一级各机关立即组织机关消费合作社，统一采购各机关人员所需的油盐煤菜与自造各种办公用具等，以减少中间剥削。但严防对外做生意及借口生产进行囤积居奇等行为。
    （四）关于清查物资和将现金移交银行方面：（甲）各单位所存物资一律清查登记，报告野战军后勤部及财委会；（乙）登记后仍留供各单位使用，太多者由上级机关个别调剂之。（丙）各单位所存金银，一概移交银行，按实际市价九折扣算，作为折实存款。
    （五）关于开展国营工厂及金融、贸易机关的精简节约运动，主要地是动员与教育工人职员爱护人民祖国的财产，节省原料、燃料，保护机器器材。这个工作如果做得不好，比任何贪污浪费的损害都要大。此外，应注意调整机构，使生产组织合理化，以达到减低成本增加生产的目的。
    邓副政委在讲话中最后指出：精简节约运动应自上而下地开展，首先要求高级干部打通思想，以身作则，起模范作用。就地区来说，则应首先搞好武汉。唯有这样，才能上行下效，把运动推广出去。其次，要走群众路线，动员全党全军卷入这个运动，各单位回去要立即进行动员。长江日报与新华社华中总分社今后报道方针应以此为中心任务之一。各机关精简节约的数字和办法、经验，要在报纸上发表，也就是向人民作报告。好的应当表扬，坏的应当批评。
    林彪司令员继即讲话，他特别强调指出：我们所遇到的困难与国民党的困难有根本性质上的差别。国民党的困难是失败中的困难，是根本不可能克服的；我们的困难则是胜利中的困难，是局部的暂时的困难，完全可以克服。但目前这种困难确是很大的，并且是实实在在的困难，绝不可忽视。林司令员接着说：华中局提出开展精简节约运动，是根据实际需要提出的；对于克服当前的财政困难，精简节约是最迅速最有效最有把握的办法，同时也是根据可能提出的。在紧缩编制，节省开支等方面，都是完全可以做到的。为贯彻华中局关于精简节约指示中的各项规定，各单位必须作精确的数目字的计算。要以数目字来订计划，定编制和检查成绩。同时要采行包干制，作为供给制的补充制度，以达到节省的目的。最后林司令员指出，这次精简节约运动，必须成为暴风雨一般的群众性的运动，但不要任其陷于自流，只是一阵风过去就完了，而要坚持下去，使之变为经常的制度，变为经常保持我党艰苦朴素作风的方法。各机关负责同志要亲自掌握，自上而下，全党动员，打通思想，开展批评与自我批评。各系统的精简节约委员会，要成为领导这一运动的经常机构，进行经常的督促与检查。
