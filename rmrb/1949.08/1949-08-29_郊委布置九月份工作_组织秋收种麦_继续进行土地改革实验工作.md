　　The Suburban Committee Deploys September Work
　　Organize Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting
　　Continue Land Reform Experiment Work
　　[Reported by this newspaper] With the autumn harvest approaching, the Suburban Work Committee convened a meeting of key suburban work cadres on the 27th and 28th to deploy and discuss land reform experiments and organize farmers for the autumn harvest and wheat planting. Comrade Chai Zemin of the Suburban Committee first delivered a report deploying the work for September, followed by group discussions, which comprehensively raised questions, and then a general discussion was held. It was unanimously agreed that land reform must be carried out. After more than a month of experiments in two villages in each district, it was fully proved that the Military Control Commission's decision on land reform in the suburbs of Beiping was correct. However, because the suburban countryside is different from general rural areas, the class relations are more complex, and many people are engaged in both industry and commerce with great mobility. In order to cautiously implement land reform and grasp the characteristics of the suburbs, it was decided to continue the experiments before the autumn harvest to gain experience, and then universally transition to land reform after the autumn harvest. When discussing the issue of agricultural production, after repeated research, it was decided that the one-month period from the White Dew to the Frost's Descent is a tense stage for agricultural production, and the autumn harvest and wheat planting should be the central tasks. All work must revolve around this work. First, mobilize all cadres to conduct in-depth propaganda on production policies to stabilize the production mood of all classes. According to the specific situation, under the principles of old habits, voluntariness, and mutual benefit, selectively call for and organize small-scale mutual aid in labor exchange. Strive to mobilize women to participate in the autumn harvest, break the old idea of women solely relying on men, commend women who are active in production, and conduct education on "labor is glorious." In mobilizing the masses to plant wheat, due to flooding in some districts and villages and a lack of wheat seeds for some poor farmers, in addition to mobilizing the masses to borrow from each other, cooperatives are responsible for preparing 400,000 to 1,000,000 jin of wheat seeds for exchange. For some farmers who are truly unable to prepare seeds, the government plans to loan 130,000 jin of wheat seeds. At the same time, in order to lay the foundation for next year's production, farmers should be educated in a timely manner to attach importance to accumulating fertilizer, promoting pig raising, pen padding, sheep raising, and dung collecting, and should be organized under the principle of mass voluntariness. All cadres must personally take action, deeply mobilize the masses, and overcome bureaucratic work styles to implement the production plan. Finally, in order to prevent bandits and special agents from sabotaging the autumn harvest and wheat planting, each district should improve the guard teams on the existing work basis, cooperate with the public security system, and effectively prevent the sabotage of bandits and special agents.

　　郊委布置九月份工作
  　组织秋收种麦
    继续进行土地改革实验工作
    【本报讯】秋收已届，郊区工作委员会特于二十七、二十八两日召开郊区主要工作干部会议，布置、讨论土地改革实验及组织农民秋收、种麦等工作。首由郊委会柴泽民同志作了布置九月份工作的报告，继由各小组分头讨论，综合提出问题，又进行了大会讨论。一致认为土地改革必须进行，经过每区两个村一月多时间的实验，充分证明军管会关于北平郊区土地改革的决定是正确的，但因郊区农村不同于一般农村，阶级关系比较复杂，加之不少群众兼营工商，流动性极大，为慎重地贯彻土地改革工作，掌握郊区特点，决定在秋收前继续进行实验，取得经验，于秋收后普遍转入土地改革。讨论到农业生产问题时，经反复研究，决定白露至霜降的一个月期间，是农业生产的紧张阶段，秋收种麦应为中心工作，一切工作必须围绕这一工作进行，首先动员全体干部，深入宣传生产政策，稳定各阶层生产情绪，根据具体情况，在旧有习惯和自愿两利的原则下，有分别的号召组织小型互助拨工。尽量动员妇女参加秋收，打破女人单纯依赖男人的旧思想，表扬生产积极的妇女，进行“劳动光荣”的教育。在发动群众种麦上，因部分区村水淹成灾和一部分穷苦农民缺乏麦种，除发动群众互借，并责成合作社准备四十至一百万斤麦种进行调换外，对部分实在无力备种的农民，政府拟出贷十三万斤麦种。同时为了打下明年生产基础，应及时教育农民重视积肥，提倡养猪、垫圈、养羊、拾粪等，在群众自愿原则下应加以组织。所有干部必须亲自下手，深入动员群众，克服官僚主义作风，以贯彻生产计划。最后，为防止匪特破坏秋收、种麦，各区应在现有工作基础上健全看青队，配合公安系统，对匪特破坏作有效制止。
