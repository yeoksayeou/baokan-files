    Starting from a Cartoon
    Reading Notes No. 9
    Ya Qun
    When the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River, we received a cartoon depicting the "Natural Barrier of the Yangtze River." However, the heroic People's Liberation Army, with the force of riding the wind and breaking the waves, crossed it in one step. It was very vivid and powerful. Unfortunately, it also depicted Li Zongren as Zhuge Kongming, playing the "Empty City Stratagem" on the Nanjing city wall, and the title was "Empty City Stratagem." The author's intention, of course, was to expose and satirize the reactionaries in Nanjing at that time, who relied on the natural barrier of the Yangtze River in a vain attempt to resist the People's Liberation Army from crossing the river. In reality, there was no power of resistance left, and pretentiously refusing to sign the generous peace terms of the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was only a path to self-destruction. However, the author did not consider that the story of the "Empty City Stratagem" is one that the Chinese people admire Kongming for, and consider him to be orthodox. In this way, comparing the number two war criminal Li Zongren to Kongming, actually greatly praised him, resulting in a political mistake!
    This fully illustrates the one-sidedness of the author's ideological method (only thinking of the "Empty City Stratagem's" ineffectiveness, while not considering the story's influence among the people and its political significance). Because of the one-sidedness of the ideological method, there was a lack of political understanding. Because of the lack of political understanding, the value of the artwork was damaged. From this simple example, it is sufficient to show that some artists do not pay enough attention to the study and cultivation of Marxism-Leninism, which is worthy of consideration.

    从一幅漫画说起
    读稿杂记之九
    亚群
    解放大军渡过长江的时候，曾收到一幅漫画，画着“长江天险”的形势，但英勇的人民解放军，以乘风破浪之势，一步便跨过去了，表现得非常生动有力，可惜的是同时把李宗仁画作诸葛孔明模样，在南京城头玩“空城计”的把戏，而画的标题也就是“空城计”三个大字，作者的意思，当然是在暴露和讽刺当时南京的反动派，仗恃长江天险，企图抵抗解放大军过江的愚妄，因为实际上已没有任何抵抗的力量了，装腔作势的拒绝签署中国人民解放军总部的宽大的和平条款，是只能自取灭亡的，可是却没有想到“空城计”的故事，在中国人民中，是颇为佩服孔明，而且认为他是正统的。这样一来，把二号战犯李宗仁比作了孔明，反而大大的称赞了他，发生政治上的错误了！
    这充分说明了作者思想方法的片面性（只想到“空城计”的不顶事的一面，而没有考虑到这故事在民间的影响及其政治意义的一面），因了思想方法的片面性，也就产生了政治水平的不够，因了政治水平的不够，也就伤害了艺术作品的价值。从这一简单的实例中，也足够说明有些艺术工作者，不大重视马列主义的学习和修养，是非常值得考虑的。
