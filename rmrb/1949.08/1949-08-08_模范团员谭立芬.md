Model League Member Tan Lifen
    Zhang Changping
    On the evening of June 4th, the sky was very clear, and the moon and stars were very bright. A classmate and I were in the fifth-grade study room, surrounding model League member Tan Lifen, asking her to tell us stories from her time in the army's cultural troupe. The bright moonlight shone through the glass window, illuminating Tan Lifen's embarrassed face. She rubbed her hands together, looking shy, and finally stammered: "It's not that I don't want to talk, but there's really nothing remarkable to say. If you'd like to hear about the hardships and dangers we encountered at the front, I can tell you a little."
    I started working in the forward cultural troupe at the age of thirteen. Because I was young at the time, comrades always tried to take care of me when I encountered difficulties. I was always very competitive and didn't want comrades who were just as tired as me to take care of me. In the autumn of 1947, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a major offensive against Shandong. Our troops were very active, hardly a night went by without marching, sometimes for more than a hundred li. It was autumn, and it often rained, the roads were muddy, and sometimes we couldn't even get food, but we still had to walk. Life was very hard, but everyone refused to bow to fatigue and hardship.
    One night, the troops crossed the Yi River. The water was deeper than me (she gestured with her hand) and the current was swift. There was no bridge. The comrades calmly raised their weapons and laboriously helped each other across. I didn't want anyone to carry me. A comrade was leading a horse heavily loaded with weapons and passed by me. I immediately followed and grabbed the horse's tail, and jumped into the water with him. The rapid river current was too much for the horse, and it started to drift downstream. At that time, I didn't know what fear was. I gripped the horse's tail tightly, refusing to let go. The muddy river water submerged me, and I swallowed several mouthfuls. When the horse handler dragged the horse ashore, I was also brought ashore in a daze. These things could not hinder our will to fight the enemy. After resting for a while, we immediately started marching again. And me? I followed along just the same.
    The Laiwu campaign began. I remember one time very clearly, our headquarters was located on a small hill. There was only a dilapidated temple on it. The main force wasn't here, and we were tightly surrounded by the enemy on all sides. It rained heavily for five consecutive days, and the enemy took this opportunity to attack us. Shells were constantly exploding, and our armed comrades resisted with heroic fighting power. But we ran out of food. We hadn't eaten anything for four or five days in a row. Everyone voluntarily gave the little food they had left to the wounded. At this time, I felt even happier and not afraid at all, because I knew that victory would ultimately be ours! When the main force arrived and surrounded and annihilated more than 20,000 of the evil enemy, it relieved a great hatred for me.
    Speaking of fighting, the more I talk, the more interesting it gets. Once, like the other comrades, I resolutely requested to go to the front line to rescue the wounded. When we appeared on the front line, it was the most intense moment of the battle. Enemy shells exploded around us, and dense bullets flew over our heads. As our soldiers shouted heroically, "Charge!", I saw a soldier wounded by a bullet. No one was carrying him with me, and I was really anxious, so I went over, grabbed his arm, and desperately dragged him a long way in one breath. Enthusiasm was encouraging class friendship, making me feel like I had great strength. But, he was still an adult, and no matter what, dragging him a long way in one breath was difficult. The bullets were still flying overhead, making people anxious and red-eyed. Just then, two civilians came from afar. I ran over to ask them to help me carry him back...

    She paused suddenly, looking down, as if deep in thought. Our eyes were fixed on her. Everything was quiet.
    Although the front was arduous, I always felt happy. Unfortunately, I was young, and the enemy's bombing damaged my brain, and I was often sick. Later, Political Commissar Deng telegraphed my grandfather (Note: Her grandfather is General Tan Zhenlin of the current Third Field Army), asking me to go to the rear to recuperate. When I found out, I was very angry. Why did he want me to go to the rear? But in the end, I went to the rear...

    She finished speaking, and we stood up and walked towards the dormitory.
    Walking, Li Delong quietly turned his head and said softly, "She truly deserves to be a member of the Youth League!"

    模范团员谭立芬
    张昌萍
    六月四日的晚上，天很清凉，月亮和小星也很亮。我和一个同学正在五年级学习室里，围着模范团员谭立芬，要她讲讲她在部队文工团里的故事，明亮的月光从玻璃窗上透进来，射到谭立芬发窘的脸上，她把两只手互相摩擦着，显出难为情的样子，终于吞吐着说：不是我不讲，实在没有什么了不起的事情可说：如果您们愿听我们在前线遇到那些艰苦危险的事情，我倒可以讲一点。
    我从十三岁开始，就在前方文工团工作。那时由于我的年纪小，遇着困难时，同志们都尽可能先照顾我。我总是很要强，不愿让和我一样累的同志来照顾我，在一九四七年秋天，国民党反动派向山东发动了重点进攻，咱们的部队活动很频繁，几乎没有一天晚上不行军，一行就是一百多里，又是秋天常常下雨，路上泥水很多，有时会连饭也吃不上，还要走，生活是很艰苦的；但是大家都不向疲劳和困难低头。
    有一天晚上，部队过沂河，水比我还深（她用手比量着）流的又急，也没有桥，同志们都沉着的抬起了武器，吃力的相互帮助先后过去了，我不愿让别人背我。有一个同志牵着一匹满驮着武器的大马，走过我身边，我马上跟上去，抓住了马尾巴，和他一起跳进水里，那河水的急流，打得马不能支持，便随着水往下冲下去，我那时也不知道骇怕了，使劲握着马尾，死也不放，混黄的河水，淹没了我，我喝了好几口；当马夫拖着马爬到岸上时，我也糊里糊涂的被带上了岸。这些，都不能阻碍我们和敌人的斗争意志，休息了一下，马上又行起军来，我呢？也一样跟着走。
    莱芜战役开始了，有一次我还清楚的记着，我们的总指挥部住在一个小山上，那上面只有座破庙，主力不在这里，四面被敌人密密包围。一连下了五天大雨，敌人就乘着这个机会，向我们袭击，炮声不断，我们的武装同志以英勇的战斗力抗拒着。但是我们的粮食吃完了，一连四五天都没有吃什么，大家都自愿把仅有剩下的一点粮食给伤员吃。我这时心里更愉快，一点也不觉怕，因为我知道胜利终是我们的！当主力调来，把万恶的敌人围攻歼灭两万多的时候，给我解了一个大恨。
    说起打仗来，越说越有意思。有一次我也和其他同志一样，坚决要求到火线抢救伤员，当我们出现在火线时，正是战斗最激烈的时候，敌人的炮弹爆炸在我们四周，密密的子弹从我们头上穿过。在我们战士英勇的喊出“冲呀！”的时候，我看见一个战士被子弹打伤，没有人和我抬他，我真急了，便过去抱着他的臂膀，拼命的一气拖了他很远，热情在鼓励着阶级友爱，使我感到自己的力气很大，但是，他总是个大人，不管怎样，一气拖得很远是困难的，子弹仍旧在头上飞着，真是急的人眼红，正在这时，那个受伤的同志苏醒过来了，他看看是我一个小姑娘在拖他，他缓缓的摆摆手，慢慢的勉强爬起来，紧紧的握着我的手，感动的落下眼泪来，但是，他马上拭去了眼泪，坚定而和蔼的说：“小妹妹，你拖不动我呀！你快去吧，我死了不要紧！”但是，我死也不走开，这时远远来了两个民夫，我急速的跑过去请他两来帮我把他抬回去………。
    她讲到这里突然停顿下来，低下头，好象在深思什么？我们的眼睛注视着她。四面静悄悄的。
    虽然前方艰苦，但我总觉着愉快，可惜我年纪小，被敌机的轰炸把脑子震坏了，时常生病。后来邓政委便打电报告诉我祖父（按：她祖父即现在的第三野战军谭震林将军），叫我到后方休养。我知道了心里很生气，他为什么要我到后方？但是最后，终于还是我到了后方……。
    她的话讲完了，我们站起来向寝室里走去。
    走着，李得隆悄悄的转回头来，小声的说：“她真不愧是个青年团员！”
