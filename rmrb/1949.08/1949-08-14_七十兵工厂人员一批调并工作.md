    A Batch of Personnel from the 70th Ordnance Factory Transferred and Consolidated
    [This Municipality News] Because the 70th Ordnance Factory is transitioning to peaceful industrial production, some technical personnel are no longer suitable for their jobs. Therefore, the factory has contacted the Taiyuan Ordnance Bureau and is preparing to transfer a dozen or so technical personnel in ordnance and chemistry to work in Taiyuan in the near future.
