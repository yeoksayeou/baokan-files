    On the Use of Mass Language
    After Reading "Heroes and Heroines"
    Bing Sheng
    I.
    "Heroes and Heroines" is entirely written in extremely skillful mass language, filled with rich colloquialisms from the masses. Every sentence is alive on the lips of the people: In the courtyard of the village office, many villagers stood, eagerly listening to the village chief Shen Yaozong and the local gentry discussing important matters in the north room. Those wealthy people were so frightened they couldn't even utter a word. Some said, "Run! Don't stick your necks out and wait to die." Others said, "What about our property? Let's see how the wind blows first." They were truly panic-stricken, everyone with a knot in their heart!
    Write as you speak, and if you say "meng bu zha de" (suddenly) or "meng de" (suddenly), don't write "huran jian" (suddenly) or "turan." These lively and vibrant colloquialisms contain many idioms: The police in the bureau were very arrogant and beat people at every turn. Even Da Shui's bald head was hit several times. They worked on it "hei jian bai ri" (day and night) for more than a month. Who knew that as soon as it was completed, the troops retreated with a "hua" (whoosh); they "qiang ren jie dao" (robbed and looted) all the way, causing quite a stir. The fortifications were built in vain, and the bureau automatically fell apart. Soon, Baoding fell, and Japanese planes flew over the city every day, dropping a few bombs. High officials "xie jin dai yin" (carried gold and silver), and petty officials "ba guo juan xi" (packed up and fled), all running away.
    Other examples include Hei Lao Cai "hao yan hao yu" (reasoning patiently) while interrogating, Li Liuzi talking with "tuo mo luan jian" (spittle flying everywhere), Da Shui feeling "qiong jia nan she, re tu nan li" (reluctant to leave his poor home, unwilling to leave his beloved land). He Shixiong believing "ning yang yi tiao long, bu yang shi zhi xiong" (better to raise one dragon than ten bears). Cui @lu saying, "Dang chai bu zi zai, zi zai bu dang chai" (being a messenger is not easy, but being free is not being one). These are all good idioms and colloquialisms.
    Proverbs are another form of the people's language, and appropriate use can increase interest and thus expand influence. For example: Da Shui's family borrowed money from Shen Yaozong, and the interest was never clear, like struggling in a well, neither dead nor alive. The puppet captain said, "You're looking at a turtle through glass, I'll never dare to do it again." Li Liuzi said that Guo San Mazi was "bei wo li fang pi, du tun" (farting in bed, keeping it all to himself).
    These folk proverbs and sayings "completely express the thoughts, especially the lessons, of the masses. They are a typical and concrete embodiment of all the life's social and historical experiences of the working people, so writers must fully know these materials." (Gorky)
    Secondly, there are folk songs, which are "created by the oral creations of the working people. If you do not know the oral creations of the peasants, it is impossible to understand the true history of the working people, and this kind of people's oral creation constantly and decisively influences the creation of the greatest literary works." (Gorky) The folk songs in "Heroes and Heroines" are mostly new, like: When the cannons roar, tears fill my eyes. The stars follow the moon, and the people follow the Communist Party. Red beans, white hearts, my mother is arranging a marriage for me, I don't want wealth and honor, I want to marry a soldier of the Eighth Route Army, a red horse and a sedan chair, the wedding procession is coming.
    Of course, there are also old ones, like: Little boy, sitting on the doorstep... which has been circulating for many years. All of this shows how "Heroes and Heroines" uses spoken language in many ways, thus becoming a successful creation that writes about the deeds of the people in the language of the people.
    II.
    "Heroes and Heroines" has a faithful attitude towards spoken language. The selection of vocabulary strives for accuracy, appropriateness, and concreteness. For example: Xiao Mei listens "zhi leng leng" (blankly), Da Shui lies on the bed alone, "hu chi hu chi" (puffing and panting) in anger, Da Shui walks in front and a large group follows "hu hu hu" (whooshing), Da Shui's house is three "zhai ba ba" (narrow) adobe houses, the soil on the wall falls "sha sha" (rustling), Shen Yaozong climbs up "yi @lu" (stumbling), noodles made "xi liu liu er" (thin and smooth), Xiao Mei gives birth to a boy, red and fat, "rou hu hu, fen ge nang er" (chubby and pink), Gao Tun'er's mother has "bai si si" (silky white) hair, Gao Tun'er's teeth clench "ge zheng zheng" (gritting), toads croak "ge wa ge wa" (croaking), the big iron lock opens with a "dang lang yi sheng" (clang), the sound of leather shoes walks "ge zha ge zha" (creaking).
    Even for a single-character word, careful selection is made: After crying "chou chou ye ye" (sobbing) for a while, she "zai" (plunges) into the well. Xiao Mei's face turns red with a "teng" (sudden) blush. Her face changes color with a "shua" (whoosh).
    The coordination of action and language is very important, and the author is good at handling them. For example: Zhang Jinlong looks down on him with a face full of contempt, and says with a sidelong glance, "Ha, your parents didn't do a good job raising you, your eyes are growing in your crotch!" (speaking to Da Shui), Cui @lu scratches his head and says, "Where did I offend you, why are you ignoring me so much?" (asking Li Lannv), Xiu Nver playfully imitates her accent and says, "Zhen si, zhen si! Ji ye ji bu zi!" (Really, really! It's too crowded!), making them laugh but afraid to laugh out loud. …Unexpectedly, the farmland is muddy, and the eldest sister slips, and all three of them fall down, covered in mud, their hands becoming mud claws; Xiu Nver also gets a pile of mud on her nose, and everyone laughs again. Tian Ying points at Xiu Nver and says, "You're good! You're good! Copying people, rotten mouth, following people, turning into a yellow dog!" Xiu Nver says, "Don't say it! Look at my posture!" She carries the eldest sister on her back, and Xiao Mei quickly lifts the eldest sister's feet, and the three of them run, swaying. The eldest sister says, "Haha! I'm Li Tiegui, flying on the clouds!" These are all very wonderful scenes.
    In addition, the writing of inner activities is also very prominent. For example: Xiao Mei is beaten, Xiao Shui wants Da Shui to see her, he says, "I'm not going, let it be!" He smokes a pipe, but unknowingly goes to his cousin's house. Xiao Mei listens, staring blankly at Da Shui, the child in her arms is making trouble, pulling her hair, but she doesn't notice. Da Shui asks him, "When did you come?" Xiao Mei can't answer for a moment, her face turns red, and she asks embarrassedly, "What did you say? The county is going to arrange elections soon, I came to tell you."
    How to see a person or feel something through a character? This is Hei Lao Cai in Da Shui's eyes: "Hei bu liu de yi shen rou, mao zha zha de lian bin hu zi" (Dark, oily skin, bristly sideburns). Xiao Shui eats biscuits and feels they are "tian si si" (sweetish). Da Shui feels "xin li le ma ma, luan zi zi" (heart is numb with happiness, all jumbled up) when he gets married and also "kan jian luan luan teng teng de hao xie ren" (sees a lot of chaotic, bustling people). When Xiao Mei gives birth to Xiao Pang (Little Fat), the old lady says softly, "Zhen shi hao cong bao de hao bai zi, hao die hao niang yang de hao hai zi" (Truly a good white bun in a good scallion wrap, good parents raised a good child).
    Expressing certain thoughts through certain language, how does Li Liuzi understand the Self-Defense Corps? He says, "I have something to tell everyone, now which village doesn't establish a potluck, other villages have all established national names." How does the old man understand Da Shui's resistance against Japan? He says, "The Central Army of hundreds of thousands can't resist, leaving not even a hair, how much ability do you have, how can you resist?" All are expressed with concise words.
    III.
    "In 'Heroes and Heroines,' each character relies entirely on his or her own language and actions, without the author's assistance, to achieve a clear personality." (Gorky) The landlord Shen Yaozong is like this: Shen Yaozong sees Hei Lao Cai returning, leading a group of people, bustling with excitement. …Seeing Hei Lao Cai coming in, he is so frightened that he takes off his satin cap and bows and scrapes to offer him a seat. …He sits on the side, stroking his moustache, and says, "Nothing to say, nothing to say. Now that the country is in trouble, we have to resist Japan. I have always advocated resistance."
    But behind his back? He scolds, "Ha, these guys, can't read, heads full of sorghum flowers, can they do anything?" He is always making trouble in the dark.
    Later, Da Shui looks for him, and in front of Da Shui, he hurriedly gets off the kang (heated brick bed) and says, "I've smoked enough. Please sit down, I'm really sorry, I'm always doing useless things." …Listening to Da Shui's words, whether he understands or not, he hums and nods. …Shen Yaozong is so frightened that his scalp explodes, and he hurriedly says, "Captain Niu, my heart is with Han while I am in Cao's camp!"
    For the sake of Squad Leader Fan Ye wanting to marry Xiao Mei: Shen Yaozong is so anxious that he wrings his hands and paces back and forth.
    Zhang Jinlong is another type. Look at the passage where he goes to the training class to find Xiao Mei, how he uses his means of first softening and then hardening! What best represents Zhang Jinlong is: Suddenly he walks in angrily from outside and says, "Yang Xiaomei, if you are my wife, pack up your bedding and leave with me immediately!" When the enemy buys him off, he pats his chest and says, "Leave this to me!" …He runs while shouting, "Zhao Wu Geng, let me go, I'll give you benefits later!" (Then he beats Zhao Wu Geng to death.)
    How is Niu Da Shui's sincere and simple peasant temperament written? Zhang Jinlong wants him to join Hejia Village: He is so anxious that his bald head sweats and says, "I, I can't, I don't have that ability!"
    Hei Lao Cai wants him to resist Japan: Da Shui is a little flustered and says hesitantly, "It's okay, but I have some work to do in the field tomorrow." …He hesitates for a while and says, "I have to talk to my old man." …Shuang Xi asks, "Who is leading us to fight Japan?" Da Shui blurts out, "Isn't it Hei Lao Cai?" Shuang Xi laughs: "Do you know what kind of person Hei Lao Cai is?" Da Shui says stupidly, "Isn't he my cousin?" After a while, Shuang Xi says in a low voice, "Da Shui, I ask you, in the future, if communism is implemented, do you think it's good?" Da Shui says stupidly, "Communism, does it share my land? I still have five mu of land!" …He asks, "Tuner, if I'm in the party, do I still farm?"
    Isn't this a vivid portrait of Niu Da Shui? Isn't it precisely these things that make us feel that he is lifelike? Also, Da Shui is always afraid that people will see that the gun behind his butt is fake, he touches it with his hand for a while, and turns his head to look for a while, fearing that the broom handle will fall out.
    In the training class, he says, "We are just farmers, it's okay to ask me to speak farmer's language, but I don't know how to give a speech." …Da Shui is sweating profusely, his words are incoherent, and he stammers a mess.
    These are concrete examples of how to obtain a character's personality from himself. "Heroes and Heroines" has sufficient spoken language and high writing skills, and what it writes about is the fighting deeds of the people; therefore, its success is not accidental.
    IV.
    Writing about the actual lives, thoughts, activities, and emotional changes of the people in the language of the people is a common feature of all successful people's literature. Only by fully mastering the language of the people can one use it appropriately at any time, which requires going deep into the masses and constantly learning.
    Language is one of the superstructures of society. When the economic base changes and material life and the social environment change, language must bear the task of reflecting new thoughts and new emotions. Therefore, it is wrong to think that language is immutable. Language is constantly changing, especially the new language emerging from the masses, which often gives new meanings to old foundations. This is the creation of people's wisdom! For example, when fighting landlords in the Taihang Mountains, the peasants, seeing that he refused to confess no matter what, shouted, "Landlord and rich man have great skills, using flowery words to deceive us!" When dividing the land, they felt that only by dividing the land could they completely turn over and shouted, "Cultivators have their land, turning over for ten thousand years!"
    Factories and troops also have their own new languages, and these new languages are created by the masses. In addition, the absorption of language is also a condition for language change. For example: Da Shui thinks, "When will I be able to record it, it would be great." Da Shui says, "Everyone, please raise your hands and forgive me!" The words "record" and "forgive" are novel to Niu Da Shui.
    But should we absorb spoken language without any principles? Of course not. We must abandon those that reflect incorrect consciousness, such as: The old woman is on a flying boat, shaking! We should transform those with vague or verbose meanings. We should avoid deliberately changing concise words that are sufficient to express meaning into verbose or even incomprehensible ones in order to express being popular or trendy, such as changing "da huo er yi kuai er" (everyone together) to "da jia huo er yi kuai dui er" (everyone in a pile together), changing "mei na shi" (no such thing) to "mei na me dang zi shi er" (no such blocking thing).
    Constantly learning from the masses, carefully and cautiously selecting and transforming, absorbing the essence of spoken language and abandoning its dross, highly using spoken language, and incorporating it into every creation, and striving for the popularization of literary language in order to achieve the utilitarianism of revolutionary literature that truly serves workers, peasants, and soldiers, is one of the most important tasks of all revolutionary literary workers!

    关于群众语言的运用
    读“新儿女英雄传”后
    炳生
    一
    “新儿女英雄传”全部是以极纯熟的群众语言写成的，这里充满了从群众中来的丰富的口语，每一句话都是活在群众嘴上的：公所的大院子里，有好些老乡站着，眼巴巴的听北屋里村长申耀宗和土绅们商量大事。那些有钱人吓得文字眼儿也没了，有的说：“跑吧，别伸着脖子等死。”有的说：“丢下家业怎么办？看看风势再说。”真是人心惶惶，谁心里也纠着一疙疸啊！
    嘴里怎么说，笔下就怎么写，嘴上说“猛不乍的”或“猛的”就不写“忽然间”或“突然”。这些口头上生动而活泼的语言中含有大量成语：局里的警察挺横，动不动就打人，大水的光脑瓜儿上也挨了几棍子。这么“黑间白日”的修了一个多月。谁知刚修好，队伍就哗的退下来；一路“抢人劫道”，闹得挺凶。工事白搭了，局子也自动的散了摊儿。不久，保定失守，日本飞机天天来头上转，城里掉了几个蛋，大官“携金带银”，小官“拔锅卷席”的，都跑光了。
    其他象黑老蔡“好言好语”的盘问，李六子“唾沫乱溅”的说话，大水是“穷家难舍，热土难离”。何世雄是“宁养一条龙，不养十只熊”。崔＠碌说：“当差不自在，自在不当差”。都是很好的成语和俗语。
    歇后语是人民语言的另一形式，适当的运用能增加趣味，因而也就扩大了影响。象：大水家借申耀宗的钱，打利打不清，就象掉在井里打扑腾，死不死活不活的。伪队长说：“你们是隔着玻璃瞧王八呢，往后我再也不敢了。”李六子说郭三麻子是“被窝里放屁，独吞。”
    这些俗谚俚语“把人民大众的思想特别是教训完全的表现着。是典型地具体化了劳动民众的一切生活上的社会历史的经验，所以作家必须完全知道这些材料。”（高尔基）
    其次是民歌，它是“劳动人民口头创作所创造的。如果不知道农民的口头创作那就不可能懂得劳动人民的真正的历史，这种人民的口头创作是不断地和决定地影响到最伟大的书本文学作品的创造的。”（高尔基）“新儿女英雄传”里的民歌；大部分还是新的，象：炮声一响，眼泪满眶。星星跟月亮，老百姓跟共产党。红豆豆，白心心，我妈给我去说亲，荣华富贵我不要，我要嫁个八路军，一匹红马一顶轿，娶媳妇的过来了。
    自然，旧的也有，象：小小子，坐门墩儿……就是流传了多年的。所有这些，都显示着“新儿女英雄传”怎样的从多方面运用口语，从而成为一部成功的以人民语言写人民事迹的创作。
    二
    “新儿女英雄传”对口语的态度是忠实的。对词汇的采用务求确切适当而具体。象：小梅“直楞楞”的听着，大水独个儿爬在床上“呼吃呼吃”的生气，大水前头走后面就“呼呼呼”的跟着一大群，大水家三间“窄巴巴”的土坯房，墙上的土“沙沙”的落下来，申耀宗“一＠碌”爬起来，捍得“细溜溜儿”的面条儿，小梅生的是个小子，又红又胖，“肉呼呼，粉个囊儿”的，高屯儿老娘“白丝丝”的头发，高屯儿的牙咬得“格铮铮”的。蛤蚂“格蛙格蛙”的叫，大铁锁“当啷一声”开了，大皮鞋的声音“咯喳咯喳”的走来。
    就是对于一个单字的词，也经过仔细的选择：抽抽噎噎的哭了一阵子，就一头“栽”下井去。小梅“腾”的红了脸。“唰”的一下变了脸色。
    行动与语言的配合很重要，作者是善于处理它们的，象：张金龙满脸的瞧不起，拿眼睛一斜他说：“吓，娘老子没把你操好，眼睛在裤裆里长着呢。”（说大水），崔＠碌抓耳搔腮的说：“我哪儿得罪你了，你这么不搭理我？”（问李兰女），秀女儿调皮的学她口音说：“真四，真四！挤也挤不子！”逗得她们直笑，又不敢笑出声来。…不提防庄稼地泥糊糊的，大姐一滑，连扶她的，三个都跌倒了，身上弄了好些泥，手都成了泥爪子；秀女儿的鼻子上也碰了一垛泥，大家又是个笑。田英指着秀女儿说：“你好！你好！跟人学，烂咀角，跟人走，变黄狗！”秀女儿说：“你别说啦，瞧我的架势！”她背起大姐，小梅忙抬起大姐的脚，三人晃晃荡荡的跑。大姐说：“哈呀！我这李铁拐架起云来啦！”都是很精采的镜头。
    此外，写内心活动的也很突出，象：小梅挨了打，小水要大水去看她，他说：“我才不去呢，爱怎么就怎么吧！”抽了一锅袋烟，可不知不觉的到他表嫂家去了。小梅听了，呆呆的望着大水，怀里的孩子闹着、揪她的头发，她都不觉着。大水问他：“你什么时候来的？”小梅一时答不上，脸儿飞红了，不好意思的问：“你说什么？最近县上就要布置选举了，我来告诉你。”
    怎样通过一个人物，来看一个人或感觉一件事物呢？这就是大水眼里的黑老蔡“黑不溜的一身肉，毛渣渣的连鬓胡子。”小水吃饼干，觉得“甜咝咝”的。大水娶亲时“心里乐麻麻，乱滋滋”的，又“看见乱乱腾腾的好些人。”小梅生小胖，大娘轻声说：“真是好葱包的好白子，好爹好娘养的好孩子。”
    通过一定的语言，表示一定的思想，李六子对自卫团是怎样了解的呢？他说：“我有个事儿跟大家念叨念叨，眼下哪村不成立锅伙，旁的村都安上国号啦。”老爹对大水抗日又如何认识呢？他说：“中央军十几万还抗不住，留得一根毛毛也没剩，你有多大能耐，你就能抗呵？”都是以简炼的字句表达出明确的思想。
    三
    “新儿女英雄传”的“各登场人物全凭其自身语言行动，不借作者的助语而求得其明确的性格。”（高尔基语）地主申耀宗是这样的：申耀宗看见黑老蔡回来，领着一拨人，折腾得挺欢。…看见黑老蔡进来，吓得摘下缎子小帽，点头哈腰的让坐。…自已坐在一边，摸着八字胡说：“没说的，没说的。如今国难当头，不抗日也不行。兄弟向来就是主张抗日的。”
    但背后呢？他骂着：“吓，这些家伙，瞎字不识，满脑袋高粱花子，也能干出个事儿来呀！”还尽在暗地里使绊儿。
    后来，大水找他，当着大水的面，他就忙着下炕，说：“我抽足了。你请坐，真对不起，我尽做些没出息的事儿。”…听着大水的话，不管听懂听不懂，都哼呀哈的点头儿……申耀宗吓得脑皮子直炸，忙着说：“牛队长，我可是人在曹营心在汉哪！”
    为着饭野小队长要娶小梅：申耀宗急得直搓手，出来进去的乱转。
    张金龙是另一种典型，试看他去训练班找小梅的一段，如何施展他先软后硬的手段！最能代表张金龙其人的是：忽然从外面气凶凶的走进来说：“杨小梅，你要是我老婆，马上卷起铺盖跟我走！”敌人拿钱买他，他拍着胸脯儿说：“这事交给我没错儿！”……一面跑一面喊：“赵五更，你放了我，以后有你的好处！”（接着就打死了赵五更。）
    写牛大水的诚恳朴实的农民气质是怎样的呢？张金龙要他加入何家庄：他急得光脑瓜儿直冒汗，说：“咱，咱不行，咱没那号本事！”
    黑老蔡要他抗日：大水一时有些慌乱，吞吞吐吐的说：“行到行，就是明天我地里有点儿活。”……迟疑了一会说：“要去得和我老爹说说。”……双喜问：“咱打日本是谁领导的啊？”大水冲口说：“还不是黑老蔡啊？”双喜笑起来：你知道黑老蔡是什么人？”大水楞头楞脑的说：“他不是我表哥吗？”过了一会儿，双喜又低声说：“大水，我问你，将来实行共产主义，你看好不好？”大水傻不唧唧的说：“共产，共我的地不？我还有五亩地呀！”……他问：“屯儿，在了党，我还种地不？”
    这不是活画出牛大水了吗？不就正是这些才使得我们觉得他栩栩如生吗？再象：大水老怕人家看出他屁股后面是假枪，一会儿用手摸摸，一会儿扭过头看看，生怕那笤帚疙疸会掉出来。
    在训练班他说：“咱们一个庄稼脑袋，叫我说庄稼话行了，叫我发言我知道怎么发呀？”……大水蹩出一身汗，前言不对后语，结结巴巴说了一泼摊。
    这就是以人物自身求得其性格的具体例子。“新儿女英雄传”既有充分的口语，又有高度的写作技巧，所写又是人民的斗争事迹，因此；它的成功不是偶然的。
    四
    以人民的语言写人民的实际生活思想活动和情感变化，是一切成功的人民文学共同的特点，只有完全熟练了人民的语言，才能随时运用得当，这就必须深入到群众里去不断的学习。
    语言是社会的上层建筑之一，当经济基础起了变化，物质生活和社会环境有所改变的时候，语言就必定要担负着反映新的思想和新的情感的任务。因此，认为语言是一成不变的，那就错误了。语言是在不断的变化着，特别是从群众中涌现出来的新语言，往往是在旧的基础上赋以新的意义，这是人民智慧的创造！比如太行区斗地主时，农民见他无论如何不肯坦白，就喊：“地主老财手腕大，花言巧语欺骗咱！”分地时；感到只有分了地才能彻底翻身，就喊：“耕者有其田，翻身万万年！”
    工厂里，部队里，也都各有其新的语言，这些新语言都是群众创造出来的。此外；对语言的吸收也是语言变化的一个条件，象：大水想：“多会儿熬磨到能记个录，就好了。”大水说：“你们大家抬抬手，原个谅吧！”记录和原谅两个词对牛大水就是新颖的。
    但是否对口语一概无原则的吸取呢？自然不能。对反映不正确意识的要扬弃，象：老妈子坐飞艇，抖起来啦。对意义模糊或罗嗦的则予以改造。更应避免故意为表现人民化或趋时而将已够表达意义的较简炼的词句改得罗嗦甚至难懂，象把“大伙儿一块儿”改成“大家伙儿一块堆儿”，把“没那事”改成“没那么挡子事儿”。
    经常的向群众学习，慎重而仔细的选择和改造，吸取口语的精华而扬弃其糟粕，高度地使用口语，把它贯穿到每一个创作里，为文艺用语的人民化而努力，以达到真正为工农兵服务的革命文艺的功利主义，是一切革命文艺工作者最重要的任务之一！
