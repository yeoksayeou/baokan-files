　　Ensuring Farmers Survive the Lean Season
　　Western Liaoning Allocates Over 6,000 Tons of Grain to Exchange for Farmers' Wheat and Cotton
    [By Our Staff Reporter] Northeast News: The Liaoxi Provincial People's Government, Trade Bureau, cooperatives, and other entities are exchanging large quantities of coarse grains for farmers' wheat and pre-purchasing cotton and local and sideline products to prevent the premature sale of crops and ensure farmers have enough food before the autumn harvest, as well as to combat speculation and price gouging by unscrupulous merchants. According to current information, some unscrupulous merchants are taking advantage of the farmers' food shortage during the lean season to deliberately lower wheat prices and raise coarse grain prices, making it impossible for farmers to exchange one pound of wheat for one pound of coarse grain. Heishan County discovered unscrupulous merchants going to the countryside to order farmers' cotton at low prices, excessively exploiting the farmers' hard work. In Jinzhou, Suizhong, and other places, unscrupulous merchants were found using coarse grains to order various fruits and trees from farmers, causing significant losses to the farmers. In order to protect the interests of farmers and combat speculative activities by unscrupulous merchants, the provincial government decided to allocate 3,750 tons of coarse grains to exchange for farmers' wheat and allocate 3,000 tons of grain to pre-purchase farmers' cotton. The Suizhong County United Cooperative has allocated 20 million jin of grain to pre-purchase fruits, trees, and local products from the masses, and the Trade Bureau is using a large amount of food to purchase farmers' sideline products and local products, so that farmers are freed from excessive exploitation by unscrupulous merchants.

  　辽西拨粮六千余吨换购农民小麦棉花
    【本报讯】东北消息：辽西省人民政府、贸易局、合作社等，以大批粗粮兑换农民的小麦，并预购棉花及土、副产品，防止卖青啃青，解决农民秋收前的食粮困难，打击奸商投机压价等行为。据目前了解，部分奸商乘农民青黄不接食粮不足之际，故意压低小麦价格，提高粗粮价格，使农民用一斤小麦，换不到一斤粗粮。黑山县发现奸商下乡，用低价定购农民的棉花，过苛的剥削农民血汗。锦州、绥中等地发现奸商用粗粮定购农民各种果木，使农民吃亏很大。为保护农民利益，打击奸商投机活动，省府决定拨粗粮三千七百五十吨，兑换农民的小麦，并拨粮三千吨预购农民的棉花。绥中县联社已拨粮二千万斤向群众预购果木及土产，贸易局则以大批食粮收购农民副业产品及土产，使农民免受奸商过苛的剥削。
