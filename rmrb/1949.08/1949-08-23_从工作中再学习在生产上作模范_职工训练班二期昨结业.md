　　Re-learn from Work and Set an Example in Production
  　The Second Phase of the Staff Training Class Concluded Yesterday
    [Our Newspaper] The second phase of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' staff training class concluded yesterday (August 22nd). This phase had a total of 309 students from 24 different production units. The study began on July 12th and lasted 42 days until yesterday. A graduation ceremony was held yesterday morning. At the meeting, Comrade Gao Zhimin summarized by saying: This study has been fruitful, but this is just the beginning. The factory is a great university. Learn from the masses, learn from work, and combine theory with practice well. Then, Comrade Peng Zhen stepped onto the stage amidst warm applause. He first congratulated everyone on the success of their studies, and then called on everyone to work hard to completely eliminate the remaining influence of the Kuomintang reactionaries from the ranks of the working class, raise the class consciousness of the working masses, enhance political vigilance, implement the people's democratic dictatorship, and conscientiously follow the mass line in factory management and trade union work, in order to further restore and develop production. Comrade Xiao Ming called on everyone to do several things after returning, namely unity, production, learning, and work. The student representatives said excitedly and happily: "After more than a month of study, we have initially established labor viewpoints, mass viewpoints, class viewpoints, and a revolutionary outlook on life. We clearly recognize that the Communist Party is the party of the working class, and we know the three enemies and four friends in the current stage of the revolution. We guarantee that we will play a leading role on the production front after we return, and that we will not be arrogant in our work, use our brains more, and constantly learn from the masses."
