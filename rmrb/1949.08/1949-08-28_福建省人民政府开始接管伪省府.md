　　Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 27th. The Fujian Provincial People's Government began taking over the Kuomintang Fujian Provincial Government organs on the 25th. At 8:00 AM on the 25th, Zhang Dingcheng, Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, convened a meeting of over 400 former staff members in the Provincial Government Auditorium. Vice Chairmen Ye Fei, Fang Yi, and the heads of various departments of the Provincial Government attended. Chairman Zhang announced in his speech: The Kuomintang's reactionary rule in Fujian has ended, and the Fujian Provincial People's Democratic Government has been established. The new regime and the old regime are completely different in essence. The Kuomintang reactionary regime has consistently betrayed the country and harmed the people, persecuted workers, farmers, students, intellectuals, and oppressed the free bourgeoisie. It violated the interests of the broadest masses of the people, and therefore was destined to perish. All the policies and measures of the People's Democratic Government are to serve the interests of the people. The new regime is a people's regime led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and opposed to imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. It represents the interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people, and therefore has today's inevitable victory. Chairman Zhang continued, pointing out that during the liberation of Fuzhou, some people in various departments of the pseudo-provincial government protected state property and archives, waiting to be taken over, which was commendable. The reactionary saboteurs are always a very small minority, and the vast majority of people are unwilling to follow the reactionary clique to betray the country and harm the people to their doom. The democratic government adopts the policy of severely punishing the ringleaders, not questioning those who were coerced, and rewarding those who perform meritorious service towards Kuomintang personnel. We welcome anyone who is truly willing to serve the people to come and perform meritorious service for the people. We will employ all talented and righteous people according to their abilities. However, the biggest weakness of the old staff members is that they have long been deceived by the Kuomintang's reactionary propaganda, and did not understand the truth of New Democracy in the past, so it is easy to confuse black and white and not distinguish right from wrong. At the same time, during the Kuomintang rule, they developed the viewpoint of opposing workers and peasants and despising workers and peasants, and lacked the viewpoint and style of serving the people. This requires hard work to transform. Finally, Chairman Zhang emphasized that all personnel should, from today onwards, establish an attitude of being responsible to the people, learn the style of the mass line, oppose bureaucratic work styles, and cultivate a simple and arduous lifestyle. After the meeting, the various departments of the Provincial Government began to carry out the takeover separately.

　　福建省人民政府开始接管伪省府
    【新华社福州二十七日电】福建省人民政府二十五日开始接管国民党福建省政府机关。二十五日上午八时，省人民政府主席张鼎丞在省府大礼堂召集全体旧职员四百余人讲话，副主席叶飞、方毅及省府各厅长均出席参加。张主席在讲话中宣布：国民党在福建的反动统治已经结束，福建省人民民主政府已经建立起来了。新政权和旧政权在本质上是完全不同的，国民党反动政权一贯卖国殃民，残害工人、农民、学生、知识分子及压迫自由资产阶级，他违背了最广大人民的利益，因此一定要灭亡。人民民主政府的一切政策措施则都是为人民利益服务的，新政权是工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的、人民大众的、反帝反封建反官僚资本的政权，他代表着中国最广大人民的利益，因此才有今天必然的胜利。张主席继指出，这次福州解放，伪省政府各部门中都有人保护国家资财及档案，等待接管，这是应该的。反动的破坏分子总是极少数，绝大多数的人都是不愿跟随反动派卖国殃民的统治同归于尽的。民主政府对于国民党人员是采取首恶者必办、胁从者不问、立功者受奖的方针处理。凡是真正愿意为人民服务的人，我们都欢迎他来为人民立功。我们对一切有才能、有正义感的人都要量才录用。但旧职员最大弱点是久受国民党反动宣传的蒙蔽，对新民主主义的真理过去不了解，所以容易黑白混淆，是非不分。同时，他们在国民党统治时代，养成了反对工农和轻视工农的观点，缺乏为人民服务的观点、作风，这是须要努力改造的。最后张主席着重指出，全体人员应从今天起树立对人民负责的态度，学习群众路线的作风，反对官僚主义作风，并培养朴素、艰苦的生活作风。会后省府各厅即分别开始进行接管。
