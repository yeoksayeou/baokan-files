    Overcoming the Pure Task Viewpoint
    Lu Zhongnan Trading Company Faces the Countryside
    Supplying Large Quantities of Industrial Products to Various Regions
    [Lu Zhongnan Telegraph] The Lu Zhongnan District Trading Company, after summarizing its work in the first half of the year and examining its purely supply-oriented viewpoint, has begun to systematically facilitate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, proactively supplying the production and livelihood needs of farmers. On July 15th, the company sent cadres to the Provincial Trading Company to purchase industrial products. The first batch of goods purchased included 200 bales of cotton yarn, 20,000 bolts of white fine cloth, 200 cases of "Advance" brand matches, and 3,200 catties of raw indigo dye. After transporting these goods south, they were distributed to various companies based on the situation and sold to villages and towns in various regions. In addition, the Xinpu and Tai'an branch trading companies in the district recently purchased some cotton yarn and white fine cloth from Jinan and Qingdao respectively and are selling them in the market to meet the needs of farmers and stabilize market prices. Furthermore, the Xinpu branch company has decided to transfer 2 million catties of wheat by sea to Qingdao to adjust the grain supply in Qingdao.
