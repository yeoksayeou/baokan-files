The year and a half since "power was transferred to Indian hands" has made things abundantly clear: the National Congress Party's national bourgeoisie seized power by signing a treacherous secret pact with British imperialism. The slavish big bourgeoisie, closely linked to Anglo-American monopoly capital, and their National Congress Party guards, betrayed India's freedom through a secret pact with British imperialism, ensuring that their parasitic privileges would not be destroyed by the advancing democratic forces.

Not long before they betrayed India, when they were still striving to sign that secret pact, they issued promises to abolish feudalism and eliminate the hateful princely system. They had vowed to nationalize all British-owned assets and basic industries in India, and they loudly guaranteed that they would support all the democratic rights cherished by our working people and anti-imperialist intellectuals. Some of them even declared that they were "bound together" with the world's anti-imperialist forces led by the great Soviet Union, and interpreted the National Congress Party's rule as the rule of Indian workers and peasants.

Even on the day the secret pact with British imperialism was finalized, Nehru, in a letter to the nation, declared:

"The future beckons us. Where shall we go, and what shall our efforts be? To bring freedom and opportunity to the common man, to the farmers and workers of India."

But the National Congress Party's rule has actually revealed itself to be an anti-democratic alliance between Indian monopoly capitalists, feudal princes, and landlords. The aim is to continue cooperating with imperialism and maintain the old, corrupt order that the imperialists entrusted to them to safeguard.

They are establishing a "republic," the main intention of which is to remain within the British Empire.

They are "abolishing" feudalism, but not by confiscating their land and distributing it to the tillers. Rather, they are persuading willing landlords to sell a portion of their shockingly large landholdings to wealthy peasants.

They have "abolished" the princely states (which account for one-third of India's territory), but by merging the five or six hundred and three of them into two or five larger states, with the bigger robber princes serving as supreme leaders, and guaranteeing the smaller parasites annual pensions equal to their original plunder.

By attacking the people of the states, they have established "responsible governments" in the states, because these people's resistance armies opposed the princes and had almost brought them to their knees. Indian government troops arrived in the states, not to depose the princes, but to disarm the people and reinstate the princes.

The first act of the Indian Army commander who arrived in Hyderabad, ostensibly to oppose the Nizam and his fascist legions, was to reinstate the defeated Nizam and outlaw the Hyderabad Communist Party. The Communist Party was the leader and organizer of the peasant guerrillas, who established India's first hard-won island of people's democracy. This island was in the land of Telangana, liberated two thousand five hundred villages, and distributed more than one hundred thousand acres of land to the peasants who tilled it. In an area of thirteen thousand square miles, more than five million working people established the rule of people's committees.

The "victorious" Indian Army is today busy establishing a "responsible government" with the assistance of the Nizam. It is sending out punitive expeditions to massacre peasant guerrillas. Indian Home Minister Patel boasted in a recent speech: "I will not allow a single Communist to survive..."

The Indian government authorities have established a Hitler-style concentration camp in Hyderabad to carry out this threat. In this camp, more than one hundred and twenty people are imprisoned in cells that can hold a maximum of forty people; and they are ordered to lie on the ground, and anyone who dares to raise their head is beaten severely, and then shot. Guerrilla fighters are tied to trucks and dragged through the main streets. Many fighters are burned alive, while the guards laugh to enjoy themselves. Police have arrested more than four thousand guerrillas since the Nizam's "defeat." But the Telangana militia is an indestructible tree, and it is igniting the fantasies of all of India's hungry and landless and land-poor cultivators with the bright vision of a glorious future.

In Tehri (a small state on the southern slopes of the Himalayas, with a population of half a million), the National Congress Party government of the United Provinces played the same despicable role. Under the banner of the united front of the Communist Party and various people's organizations, the people rose up against the Maharaja's princely rule. The oppressed and impoverished peasants formed the backbone of this struggle for land and democracy. The resistance spread from one region of the state to another.

On January 12, 1948, in a battle between peasant guerrillas and the Maharaja's troops, the Communist Party member, esteemed peasant leader, Sikhlani, was killed in action. This event triggered another uprising throughout the state, and the peasants began to attack the capital. The Maharaja panicked and hastily sent a telegram to the National Congress Party government of the United Provinces for help. The armed police of the United Provinces advanced on Tehri to prevent "chaos and anarchy," disarmed the guerrillas, retaliated against them, and only after annexing the state to the United Provinces, restored the prince's order.

The Indian government has abandoned the publicly announced ten-year period for nationalizing foreign-owned or Indian monopoly capital. To comfort the workers, they have solemnly promised to "reconsider this situation" at the end of 1958! They have assured Anglo-American monopoly capital that: "When formulating policies, the government will allow foreign investment to further invest in India under mutually beneficial conditions."

"The rule of workers and peasants" is brought about by the government imprisoning more than twenty-five thousand Communist Party members, trade union leaders, workers, fighters, and organizers of the All-India Peasants' Assembly and the All-India Trade Union Congress, and launching bloody suppression and acts of terror against every symbol of organized democratic protest and action.

The Indian government has "obstructed" freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association, because it gives free rein to the greedy Indian landlords, princes, capitalists, and Anglo-American lackeys seeking cheap labor, while banning the Communist Party in several places and several trade unions and peasant associations, and using tear gas, batons, and shootings to mercilessly break up mass rallies and meetings of women, peasants, students, and workers. They have issued arrest warrants for leading cadres of the Indian Communist Party, which effectively declares the Indian Communist Party illegal. They have used the Markville Labor Disputes Act, methods of harassment, and immediate retaliation, and have in effect cancelled the workers' right to strike. The Public Safety Measures Act "reformed" and planned by the National Congress Party governments of the provinces authorizes a certain class of police officers to arrest anyone without a warrant, as long as he believes that the person's actions are and may endanger public safety. He also has the right to detain the person arrested in this way for fifteen days. Moreover, according to this law, the provincial governments have the right to imprison the person arrested in this way for another three years without stating reasons!

Around February 1949, nearly nine hundred railway worker leaders were suddenly arrested by the Nehru-Patel government because the majority of Indian railway workers voted in favor of holding a general strike to fight for appropriate wage levels.

However, the Nehru and Patel cabinet blamed the growing discontent of Indian railway workers on "Communist agitation to use violence"—a cliché excuse of monopoly capitalist lackeys. Mass rallies of railway workers were broken up with batons, armed police were sent to the streets, patrolling workers' areas, and military guards were stationed along the railway lines, and the strike was crushed.

The anti-strike law was extended for six months, which prohibited all strikes by railway workers, postal, telegraph, and dock workers.

In the movement to crush the railway workers' strike, an order was passed to close the Communist Party Central Printing Plant in Bombay for three months. As a result, the party's central organ, People's Century, was unable to be published. And Nehru announced in early March: "His government is seriously considering the issue of outlawing the Indian Communist Party."

It should be pointed out that the basic wages of workers in industries (such as jute, textiles, mining, etc.) do not exceed twelve annas (equal to one shilling, that is, one-twelfth of a pound) per day, while the rupee (Indian currency) is only worth one-quarter of its pre-war purchasing value. Therefore, the large-scale industrial worker strikes in the past year and a half have been arduous struggles, in which workers not only had to face the large-scale fascist retaliatory measures of the military police and the sabotage of mercenaries of the All-India Trade Union Congress (an anti-labor organization fostered by the Ministry of Internal Affairs) and the methods of the Ku Klux Klan, but also the assassinations by assassins hired by private factory owners and tycoons. But regardless of all kinds of terror, retaliation, torture and torture, industrial worker strikes have been growing and will continue to grow.

India's agricultural crisis is becoming increasingly acute, and our countryside is filled with suffering and anger, all of which are caused by unprecedented hunger and poverty.

Since 1935, the number of landless peasants has doubled, and today it reaches 70 million, forming the largest mass of working people. The daily wage of these landless agricultural laborers is eight annas to one rupee. Then, is there anything surprising about the fact that our vast mass of hungry peasants are increasingly expressing contempt and anger at the National Congress Party leaders' methods of "abolishing" feudalism and eliminating princely parasites? Is there anything surprising about the fact that in many areas, peasants are engaging in implementing the slogan "Land to the Tiller"?

The Indian government has officially declared an "independent" foreign policy of "neutrality," which is nothing more than a fig leaf to cover up their subservient cooperation with the Anglo-American axis, which is based on the hope of obtaining loans to jointly exploit our working people and the markets of Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa with Anglo-American monopoly capital. Large loans and market lures are being used as the price for making the Indian government act as an imperialist gendarme in Southeast Asia.

The government's formal support for the Western European Union, for the Anglo-American-hosted conference on Indonesia and Burma held in Delhi, for the landing of the Kukri troops sent to Malaya for plunder for British imperialism, and the establishment of "civilian" airports with the help of Anglo-American financial and technical assistance, the recent visit to India by Anglo-American technical experts representing the oil magnates of London and Washington to study the prospects for large-scale oil production in India, the Indian government's recent defamation of the national liberation struggles in Indonesia, Malaya, Vietnam, Thailand, and Burma, and the open hostility towards the great victories of the Chinese People's Liberation Army—all these undoubtedly and openly reveal that the Indian government has, on the orders of the Anglo-American axis, prepared the foundation for the "Indian Ocean Pact." The purpose of this pact is to oppose the liberation struggles in Southeast Asia, to oppose the Soviet Union (the firm defender of the freedom of all peoples in the world), and the People's Democratic China.

The Indian ruling class, which is swallowing the "Asian leader" bait held by the imperialist masters, is turning our country into a base for imperialism against the Asian national revolution, against People's Democratic China, and against the great Soviet Union.

However, the increasing fascist-style retaliation and terror launched by our "national" government shows the depth of the social and economic crisis contained in India. It also shows the strength and tenacity of the People's Democratic Front, which is steadily moving forward under the firm leadership of the Indian working class.

The representatives of the democratic front of the working people and oppressed middle class of India will not allow our motherland to be turned into a base for Anglo-American warmongers. They will awaken and realize that India can only be a base for fighting for independence, people's democracy, and peace.

　　印度真貌
    恰布赫克著  英华翻译
    从“政权转到印度手中”以来的一年半时间已经使事情十分明白：国民大会党的民族资产阶级由于和英国帝国主义签订了一个叛卖密约而掌握政权。奴颜婢膝的大资产阶级和英美独占资本有密切联系，他们及他们的国民大会党的卫士因为与英国帝国主义有一个密约而出卖了印度的自由，藉使他们的寄生性特权不为一往直前的民主势力所摧毁。
    在他们出卖印度以前不久，当他们还在争取签订那一密约的时候，他们即已发出废除封建主义和取消可恨的王公制度的诺言。他们曾经预诺把印度的一切英国人所有的资产和基本工业收归国有，而且他们还大声地保证他们将要支持为我们劳动人民及反帝国主义知识分子所珍爱的一切民主权利。他们之中有些人甚至宣布他们和伟大的苏联领导的世界反帝国主义势力“休戚与共”，并把国民大会党的统治解释成为印度工农的统治。
    甚至在对英国帝国主义的密约最后形成的那一天，尼赫鲁在告国民书中还宣布说：
    “未来向我们招手。我们将向何处去，我们的努力将是什么？把自由和机会带给一般人，带给印度的农民和工人。”
    但是国民大会党的统治实际上已经显示出是印度独占资本家封建王公和地主之间的反民主同盟。目的是继续与帝国主义合作，并保持帝国主义分子交给他们维护的旧的、腐朽的秩序。
    他们正在建立一个“共和国”，而这个“共和国”的主要意图就是仍旧留在英帝国范围之内。
    他们正在“废除”封建主义，但废除的方法不是把他们的土地没收来分给耕者。而是说服愿意的地主把他们多得骇人听闻的土地的一部分卖给富有的农民。
    他们已经“取消”了王公土邦（它们占印度三分之一的领土），但方法是把其中的五六三个合并成二五个更大的土邦，由更大的强盗王公担任最高首领，并给较小的寄生虫保证得到等于他们原来的掠夺物的年偿金。
    他们用进攻各邦人民的方法，已经在各邦建立了“负责的政府”，因为这些人民的抵抗军反对王公，而且几乎已经使他们屈服了。印度政府军队开到各邦来，不是使王公退位，而是解除人民的武装，使王公重新登位。
    开到海德拉巴来，表面上反对尼赞姆和他的法西斯军团的印度陆军司令的第一个行动，便是重新扶植已被击败的尼赞姆和取缔海德拉巴的共产党。共产党是农民游击队的领导者和组织者，这支游击队建立了印度第一个坚苦奋斗得来的人民民主的孤岛。这个孤岛是在特连加纳的土地上的，解放了二千五百个村庄，并把十余万英亩土地分给了耕地的农民。在一万三千平方英里的土地上，五百余万劳动人民建立了人民委员会的统治。
    “胜利的”印度陆军今天正忙于在尼赞姆的协助下建立“负责的政府”。它正派遣讨伐队去残杀农民游击队。印度内政部长巴特尔在最近一次演说中夸口说：“我将不允许一个共产党员生存……”
    印度政府当局已经在海德拉巴建立了一个希特勒式的集中营，以实行这种威胁。在这个集中营中，在最多只能容纳四十个人的囚室里，监禁了一百二十余人；而且命令他们卧倒地上，谁敢把头抬起来，谁就立遭毒打，然后又予枪杀。游击队战士被绑在卡车上，在通衢大道上拖着走。许多战士被活活烧死，而卫兵却看了大笑以取乐。警察在尼赞姆“失败”后，已经捉了四千余游击队。但是特连加纳的民兵已经是一株摧残不死的树，它以光辉的未来的灿烂远景，燃烧起全印度饥饿和无地和少地的耕种者的幻想。
    在特赫里（喜马拉雅山脉南部斜坡上的一个小邦，人口五十万），联合省的国民大会党政府起了同样可鄙的作用。在共产党和各人民团体的统一战线旗帜下，人民奋起反抗马哈拉扎的王公统治。被压迫的和穷困的农民形成了这个争取土地和民主斗争中的骨干。这次反抗从这一邦的一个地区扩展到另一个地区。
    在一九四八年一月十二日，农民游击队和马哈拉扎的军队间的战斗中，共产党员，有威望的农民领袖锡克拉尼阵亡了。这件事引起了全土邦的另一次起义，农民开始向首邑进攻了。马哈拉扎吓慌了，赶忙打了一个求救的电报给联合省的国民大会党政府。联合省政府的武装警察向特赫里前进，以防止“混乱和无政府状态”，解除游击队的武装，向他们施行报复，并在把该土邦并入联合省后，才挽回和恢复了王公的秩序。
    印度政府已经放弃在公开宣布的十年期间把外国所有或印度的独占资本收归国有。为了安慰工人，他们已经庄严地预诺在一九五八年年底“重新考虑这一情势”！他们已经向英美独占资本保证：“政府制订政策时，将使外国能在双方有利的条件下进一步向印投资”。
    “工农的统治”是政府引起来的，因为政府囚禁了二万五千余名共产党员、职工会领袖、工人、战士和全印农民大会和全印职工大会的组织者，而且对每一个有组织的民主的抗议和行动的象征，发动血腥的镇压和恐怖行为。
    印度政府已经“阻碍了”言论、出版、集会和结社的自由，因为它给贪婪的印度地主的、王公、资本家和英美寻求廉价劳动的资本家走卒以自由行动之权，另一方面却取缔好些个地方的共产党和若干职工会和农民协会，而且用催泪弹，警棍和枪杀的办法，无情地击破妇女、农民、学生和工人的群众大会和会议。他们发出了逮捕印共领导干部的拘票，这就实际上宣布了印共为非法。他们利用马克维尔劳工纠纷法、磨难和立即报复的方法，而在实际上取消了工人的罢工权。各省国民大会党政府所“改良”与规划的公共安全措施法，授权一定阶级的警官无需执有拘票而可以逮捕任何人，只要他认为这个人的行动正在而且可能危及共公安全。他并有权把这样逮捕的人拘禁十五天。不但如此，依据这个法律，各省政府有权无需申述理由而把这样逮捕的人再行监禁三年！
    一九四九年二月前后一星期间，因为印度铁道工人中的大多数投票赞成举行总罢工，争取适当的工资水平，而有近九百位铁道工人领袖突然被尼赫鲁—巴特尔政府所逮捕。
    但是，尼赫鲁和巴特尔内阁却把印度铁路工人日益增长的不满归咎于“共产党鼓动使用暴力”——独占资本家走卒陈腐的借口。铁道工人的群众大会被警棍打散，武装警察被派到街道上，在工人区巡逻，铁道沿线由军事警卫队站岗，罢工才被粉碎了。
    反罢工法有效期延长了六个月，这个反罢工法禁止铁道工人、邮政、电报和码头工人的一切罢工。
    在粉碎铁道工人罢工的运动中，通过了一道命令，封闭在孟买的共产党中央印刷厂三个月。因而使党的中央机关报人民世纪无法出版。而且尼赫鲁在三月初宣布：“他的政府正郑重地在考虑取缔印度共产党这个问题”。
    应该指出：工业（如黄麻、纺织、采矿等）中工人的基本工资每天不超过十二安那（等于一先令，即十二分之一镑），而卢布（印度货币）只值战前购买价值的四分之一。因此，过去一年半期间的产业工人大罢工曾经是坚苦的斗争，在这些斗争中，工人不仅必须面临军警的大规模的法西斯报复手段和印度全国职工大会（内政部所卵翼的反劳工组织）的佣兵的破坏及三Ｋ党的方法，而且还要面临私人厂主和大亨们所雇用的刺客的暗杀。但是不管有各种各样的恐怖、报复、磨难和拷打，产业工人的罢工已在不断增长，而且将继续增涨。
    印度的农业危机正在变得日益尖锐，而且我国乡村正弥漫着痛苦和愤怒，这些都是由于空前的饥饿和贫穷引起来的。
    自一九三五年以来，无地农民已经增加了一倍，今天数达七千万人，形成最巨大的劳动人民群众。这些无地的农业劳动者每天的工资是八安那到一卢布。那么，我们的饥饿农民大众对于国大党领袖“废除”封建主义和取消王公寄生虫的方法，日益表示轻蔑和愤怒，难道还有什么可惊奇的？对于在许多地区，农民正在从事于实行“耕者有其田”的口号，难道还有什么值得惊奇？
    印度政府已正式宣布“独立的”对外“中立”政策，这不过是掩盖他们与英美轴心卑屈合作的遮羞布而已，而这种合作是建基于取得借款，以与英美独占资本共同剥削我国劳动人民及东南亚、中东和非洲市场的希望之上的。大量借款和市场的钓饵，被当作使印度政府在东南亚起帝国主义宪兵作用的代价。
    政府对西欧联盟、对英美主持的在德里举行的关于印尼和缅甸的会议，对派遣为英帝国主义进行掠夺的库克族军队登陆马来亚的正式支持，和借助英美财政与技术援助建立“民用”机场，代表伦敦和华盛顿的石油大王的英美技术专家最近访问印度，以研究印度大规模石油生产的前途，印度政府最近对于印尼、马来亚、越南、泰国和缅甸的民族解放斗争的诋毁，和对中国人民解放军巨大的胜利进展的公开仇视——一切这些毫无疑义地公开揭露出印度政府已奉英美轴心之命，为“印度洋公约”准备基础。这个公约的目的是反对东南亚争解放的斗争，反对苏联（举世各族人民的自由的坚决保卫者）和人民民主中国。
    正在吞下帝国主义主子所拿着的“亚洲领袖”的钓饵的印度统治阶级，正在把我国变为帝国主义反对亚洲民族革命、反对人民民主中国和反对伟大的苏联的基地。
    但是，我们的“国民”政府所发动的日益增强的法西斯式报复和恐怖，显示出印度所包含的社会与经济危机的深度。它并显示：人民民主阵线的力量和顽强，这个阵线在印度工人阶级坚决领导下正稳步向前迈进。
    印度的劳动人民和遭受压迫的中等阶级的民主阵线的代表们将不允许我们的祖国被变成英美战争贩子的基地。他们将要觉醒起来，因而发觉印度只能是争取独立、人民民主与和平的基地。
