    The American Paper Tiger Grows Weaker
    The Plan to Arm Western Europe is Criticized by People Worldwide
    Using Japanese and Chiang Bandits to Oppose the People of the Far East is Nothing Short of Dreaming

    American imperialism is further preparing for new war adventures. Following the US Senate's approval of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, US President Truman sent a message to the US Congress on the 25th, proposing a "Military Foreign Aid Plan" as a supplement to this aggressive treaty. According to this plan, the United States will allocate 1.45 billion yuan in the coming year to be used for weapons, equipment and personnel training for the Western European signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty, as well as Greece, Turkey, Iran, the Philippines, and South Korea. Truman's sinful plan has not only been criticized by progressive public opinion around the world and firmly opposed by progressive forces in the United States, but has also caused serious disputes and infighting within the American ruling group. Even Vandenberg and Connally, who advocated the North Atlantic Treaty most vigorously, believe that the "arming plan must be revised and its cost reduced" because they are afraid of making a losing deal. Currently, the Truman government is creating an atmosphere of artificial international crisis in order to force the opposition in Congress to accept its plan. However, this trick of the Truman government has been seen through by American and world public opinion, and it is obviously not going to be very effective. At the same time, Truman has also encountered resistance in the appropriation of funds for the second year of "foreign aid." The 5.43 billion yuan "foreign aid plan" that Truman signed as early as April has recently been cut by more than 10 percent by the Senate Appropriations Committee. This year's military expenditure of more than 15 billion yuan has also been reduced by 1.01 billion yuan. During the Senate plenary session on the 26th to discuss the reduction issue, angry and agitated senators staged a rare brawl amidst a chorus of hisses. The differences and confusion between the two parties in the American ruling group over the quantity and method of "arming plans" and foreign appropriations reflect the intensification of internal contradictions within the American ruling group under the pressure of the impending American economic crisis and the serious failure of foreign aggression plans. At the same time, it shows that the position of the warmongers is further weakened, and the war threats of the American government are more bankrupt. The fragility of the American paper tiger is becoming more and more obvious.

    At the same time, another aggressive plan of the United States, the organization of the so-called "Pacific Alliance," is continuing actively. After Romulo, the American-tamed lackey, returned to the Philippines on the 22nd with instructions from US Secretary of State Acheson, the US State Department officially announced on the 27th that the US government had invited Philippine puppet President Quirino to meet with Truman in Washington on August 8th. The primary item on the agenda for the meeting between Truman and Quirino will be the "Pacific Alliance." Former Japanese Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama has already visited Washington a few days ago to meet with US government officials and members of Congress, and he will also travel around New York, Chicago, and other places. The Kuomintang bandit gang has dispatched Shao Yulin to the South Korean puppet government via Manila and other places with the qualification of so-called "Ambassador to South Korea." One of his missions is to arrange a meeting between the two loyal dogs of American imperialism - Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee. Behind these activities, a military conspiracy is being advanced. Bandit leader Yan Xishan has already revealed part of this secret. According to Yan Bandit, the Kuomintang bandit gang is recruiting so-called "international volunteer army," including troops from the Japanese bandits, the mortal enemy of the Chinese nation, to come to China to help the remnant bandits fight against the Chinese people. In this way, the United States openly presides over the anti-people Pacific Alliance, continues to help the Kuomintang remnant bandits carry out their death throes and suppress the Far Eastern people's movement, while the Kuomintang reactionaries are determined to lead wolves into the house, attempting to use the help of foreign bandits to carry out a restoration, which is even more nakedly exposed. However, for the attempt of American imperialism to rely on such a fragile "alliance" to save the rule of the reactionaries in China and the East, anyone with a little common sense would laugh at it as simply daydreaming.

    Under the direct command of MacArthur, the reactionary Japanese Yoshida government has increasingly and frantically launched attacks on the labor and democratic forces in Japan. The Japanese working class is not only deprived of the right to strike and collective bargaining today, but also, under the terror rule of the police, it has actually been deprived of the right to participate in progressive trade union activities, and even the right to work and survive. In order to implement the plan of American monopoly capital to maintain a huge unemployed army in Japan, the reactionary Yoshida government laid off 160,000 government employees for the first time in July. This layoff plan of the Yoshida government also contains a vicious political conspiracy to attack the progressive forces in the Japanese trade unions. The Yoshida government used layoffs to focus on dismissing activists or communists in trade unions. All seventeen left-wing members of the Central Struggle Committee of the National Railway Workers' Union have been completely "laid off." Many union leaders in Tokyo, Heian, Fukushima, and other places who led workers in their struggle for survival were imprisoned. In order to crack down on the backbone of the Japanese labor movement and democratic forces - the Japanese Communist Party, after manufacturing the Shimoyama incident, a replica of the German Reichstag fire, the Yoshida government fabricated the "automatic" derailment incident of a train at the Mita Station in Tokyo, and unreasonably arrested two communist party members. After the Yoshida traitorous government published news in the Osaka local newspaper that foreign "beasts in human clothing" had massively raped Japanese girls in Tsuruga Port, it shamelessly used the excuse of "insulting" the occupation army to attack the Japanese Communist Party, and massively arrested more than 100 communist party members and progressives. These anti-people and traitorous acts of the Yoshida government have aroused the firm resistance of the Japanese workers. The largest trade unions in Japan, such as the All Japan Confederation of Public Service Employees' Unions, the Railway Workers' Union, and the Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union, have unanimously announced that they will fight the government's layoff plan to the end. The Japanese Communist Party has repeatedly issued statements, exposing the reactionary essence of the Yoshida government in suppressing the people with the fascist methods of Hitler and Tojo, and calling on the Japanese people to carry out a resolute struggle to overthrow the Yoshida cabinet. At the same time, the American occupiers not only directed the Yoshida government to frantically suppress the Japanese people, but also approved 2 million Japanese firefighters to serve as special police, and openly admitted that the United States is now using Japanese factories and manpower to manufacture a large number of munitions. The American occupiers and the Japanese reactionaries colluding with each other to implement this series of reactionary measures, the purpose is to destroy the democratic forces of the Japanese people, support the reactionary and traitorous forces of Japan, and make Japan a central base for attacking the people of the Far East. The Chinese people must unite with the people of various countries in the Far East to oppose this retrograde act in violation of the Potsdam Proclamation.

    美国纸老虎愈来愈脆弱
    武装西欧计划遭到全世界人民抨击
    利用日蒋匪反对远东人民无异做梦
    美国帝国主义正在进一步进行新战争冒险的准备工作。继美国参院批准侵略性的北大西洋公约以后，美国总统杜鲁门于二十五日咨文美国国会，提出了作为这一侵略公约补充的“军事援外计划”。按照这个计划，美国将在今后一年内拨款十四亿五千万元，充作对北大西洋公约西欧各签字国以及希腊、土耳其、伊朗、菲律宾、南朝鲜等国进行武器装备及人员训练的费用。杜鲁门这个罪恶计划，不但遭到全世界进步舆论的抨击，遭到美国进步势力的坚决反对，而且也引起了美国统治集团内部严重的争吵和暗斗。甚至提倡北大西洋侵略公约最力的范登堡与康纳利之流，也因害怕做赔本买卖，而认为“武装计划必须重订并削减其费用”。目前，杜鲁门政府又在制造人为的国际危机的空气，以便强迫国会中的反对派接受其计划。但是，杜鲁门政府这种伎俩，已被美国和世界舆论所识破，显然是不会太灵验的了。同时，杜鲁门在第二年度“援外”费用的拨款上，也同样遇到了阻力。杜鲁门早在四月间即已签署的五十四亿三千万元的“援外计划”，最近被参院拨款委员会削减了百分之十以上。本年度一百五十余亿元的军费，也被削减了十亿一千万元。参院全体会议二十六日在讨论削减问题时，暴躁、激动的参议员在嘘嘘四起声中，竟然演出了近几年罕有的一场互相殴打的丑剧。美国两党统治集团在“武装计划”、对外拨款等数量和方法问题上的分歧与混乱，反映了在美国经济危机迫近和对外侵略计划严重失败之下，美国统治集团内部矛盾的加剧。同时也显示战争贩子的地位是更加削弱了，美国政府的战争恫吓更加破产了。美国纸老虎的脆弱性是越来越明显了。
    与此同时，美国的另一个侵略性计划，组织所谓“本平洋联盟”，也正在继续积极进行中。在美国驯服的奴才罗慕洛衔美国务卿艾奇逊的指示于二十二日返抵菲律宾之后，美国国务院又于二十七日正式宣布，美政府已邀请菲傀儡总统季里诺于八月八日至华盛顿会见杜鲁门。杜鲁门与季里诺会谈的首要项目，将是“太平洋联盟”；而日本前首相片山哲已于日前访问华盛顿，拜会美政府官员和议员，他并将周游纽约、芝加哥等地。国民党匪帮则已派遣了邵毓麟以所谓“驻韩大使”资格经马尼拉等地前往南朝鲜傀儡政府，他的使命之一是布置美帝国主义的两条忠实走狗——蒋介石和李承晚——的会谈。在这些活动的幕后，一项军事阴谋正在推进。匪首阎锡山已经透露了这个秘密的一部分，据阎匪说，国民党匪帮正在招募所谓“国际志愿军”，其中包括中华民族的死敌日寇军队，将到中国帮助残匪作战，对抗中国人民。这样，美国公开主持反人民的太平洋联盟，继续帮助国民党残匪进行垂死挣扎和镇压远东人民运动，而国民党反动派则决心引狼入室，图借外寇之助，举行复辟，就更加赤裸裸地暴露了。但是，对于美帝国主义想依靠这样一个脆弱的“联盟”来挽救反动派在中国和东方的统治的企图，有一点常识的人都会笑它简直是在做梦。
    日本吉田反动政府在麦克阿瑟直接指挥下，愈益疯狂地发动了对日本劳工与民主势力的进攻。日本工人阶级今天不但被剥夺了罢工和集体议价的权利，而且在警察的恐怖统治下，实际上已被剥夺了参加进步的职工会活动以至劳动和生存的权利。吉田反动政府为了执行美国独占资本在日本保持庞大失业军的计划，已于七月份首次裁去十六万政府雇员。吉田政府这一裁员计划，还包藏着打击日本职工会中进步势力的恶毒的政治谋阴。吉田政府利用裁员，着重裁去工会中的积极分子或共产党员。国营铁道工人工会中央斗争委员会中的十七名左翼委员，已被完全“裁退”。东京、平港、福岛等地领导工人进行生存斗争的许多工会领袖，竟被琅＠下狱。为了打击日本劳工运动与民主势力的中坚——日本共产党，吉田政府在制造德国国会纵火案的翻版下山案件之后，又制造了东京见高车站火车“自动”出轨事件，无理逮捕共产党员二人。吉田卖国政府在大坂地方报纸登载外国“衣冠禽兽”在敦贺港大批强奸日本少女的新闻之后，竟寡廉鲜耻地以“侮辱”占领军为借口，向日本共产党开刀，大肆逮捕共产党员及进步分子一百余名。吉田政府这些反人民的卖国行为，激起了日本劳工的坚决反抗。日本最大的工会如全日公务员工会联合会、铁道工人工会、递信工人工会等，一致宣布将与政府的裁员计划斗争到底。日本共产党更屡次发表声明，揭穿吉田政府以希特勒、东条的法西斯办法镇压人民的反动本质，号召日本人民为推翻吉田内阁而进行坚决的斗争。同时，美国占领者不仅指使吉田政府疯狂地镇压日本人民，而且已批准日本二百万消防队员充任特别警察，并公开承认美国现正利用日本的工厂备设与人力，大量制造军火。美国占领者和日本反动派相勾结，施行这一连串的反动措施，目的在于摧毁日本人民的民主势力，扶植日本的反动卖国势力，使日本变成进攻远东人民的中心基地，中国人民一定要联合远东各国人民反对这种违反波茨坦公告的倒行逆施。
