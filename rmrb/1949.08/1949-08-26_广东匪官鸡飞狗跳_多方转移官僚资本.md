　　Guangdong Bandit Officials in a Frenzy
  　Transferring Bureaucratic Capital in Various Ways
    [Hong Kong News] According to the "Hua Shang Bao", Guangdong's Kuomintang bandit officials, seeing the Liberation Army's spearhead drawing ever closer, are in a panic, packing up their valuables and scrambling to escape. They are racking their brains for all sorts of despicable and bizarre methods to transfer bureaucratic capital. The sale of the Dongguan Sugar Factory to Chiang's "Resources Committee" is an outstanding example. It is reported that the owners of the Dongguan Sugar Factory are Chen Jitang and Yu Hanmou. Relying on their political power, they have run it with considerable profit. However, the sugar factory's machinery is bulky and cannot be moved. With the liberation of Guangzhou imminent, Chen and Yu felt "distressed" at the sight of such a large amount of property about to be taken over by the people. After more than a month of negotiations and secret discussions, and using local forces to put pressure on the fake "central government," Chen Jitang and Yu Hanmou have signed an agreement to sell this bureaucratic industry, which is currently unable to produce and will soon be taken over, to the fake "Resources Committee." The selling price is 30,000 bags of Taiwan sugar (each bag worth HK$70, totaling HK$2.1 million). 10,000 bags have already been delivered, and the remaining 20,000 bags will be delivered successively as agreed. Chen and Yu are selling the sugar they obtained cheaply in Hong Kong, depositing the cash in Hong Kong banks, and preparing it for "white China" expenses. During the course of the transaction, some well-informed "piglet" legislators were fleecing Chen and Yu, saying, "What's the use of the state buying this sugar factory now! You are colluding to fool the 'state,' but in reality, you are taking advantage of the situation to rob it, and we cannot sit idly by," and so on. Chen and Yu later agreed to give each of them two bags of sugar (i.e., HK$140) to suppress the matter.
    There are many other "factory transfer methods" of Guangdong "local forces" "fleecing" the fake "central government." For example, the Cement Factory, Textile Factory, Soda Factory, Shunde Sugar Factory, and other "provincial-run" industries are being "considered" under the direction of Xue Yue.

　　广东匪官鸡飞狗跳
  　多方转移官僚资本
    【香港讯】据华商报载称：广东的国民党匪官们看着解放军日益逼近的矛头，吓得鸡飞狗跳，卷起细软，争相逃命。他们想尽各种卑鄙离奇的方法，转移官僚资本，东莞糖厂卖给蒋记“资源委员会”，就是一个出色的例子。据悉：东莞糖厂的老板为陈济棠和余汉谋，靠着他们的政治力量，经营颇获厚利。惟糖厂机件笨重，无法搬运，当此广州解放前夕，偌大一笔财产眼看要被人民接收，陈、余心里“难过”得很。经过一个多月的谈判、密商，运用地方势力给伪“中央”以压迫，已由陈济棠、余汉谋两人签字，把这个目下不能生产，不久必被接收的官僚工业卖给伪“资源委员会”了，售价是台湾砂糖三万包（每包值港币七十元，共计港币二百一十万），已交足一万包，其余二万包按约陆续清交。陈、余两人以所得的砂糖运至香港贱卖，把现款存在香港银行，准备作“白华”费用。买卖进行之中，若干消息灵通的猪仔立委向陈、余两人大敲竹杠说：“国家现在买到这个糖厂有什么用！你们串同一起，来＠‘国家’的笨，实则是趁火打劫，我们万难坐视”云云。陈、余后来答应每人送糖两包（即港币一百四十元）才把事情压下。
    广东“地方势力”向伪“中央”“敲竹杠”式的“工厂转移方法”还有多起，例如士敏土厂、纺织厂、汽水厂、顺德糖厂等“省营”工业，正由薛岳指挥“斟盘”中。
