Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: TASS, Moscow, 16th: Izvestia commented on Philippine President Quirino's trip to the United States, saying: "If certain circumstances were not already known, then the clamor surrounding this 'statesman's' visit might have caused bewilderment. The role of this 'statesman' in international affairs is as dubious as the 'independence' of the country he leads. Quirino arrived in Washington on the day after the State Department released its so-called 'White Paper,' which contained direct admissions of the collapse of American policy toward China. According to American newspapers, especially the New York Times, this visit, or rather the summoning of the Philippine President to Washington, is related to 'anticipated new actions regarding Far East policy.'"

What are these "actions," and what will this "policy" look like? Judging from all indications, the American ruling groups will not achieve any result other than the bankruptcy of their policy (which is now officially admitted by the State Department). Because this plan is another futile effort to decide the fate of the Far Eastern people without the masters, that is, without the Far Eastern people.

Some time ago, when Australian Prime Minister Chifley, with open encouragement from London, proposed the establishment of a Pacific Pact, he did not receive support from Washington. The U.S. State Department stated: The United States does not consider it advisable to organize other military-political blocs in addition to the recently organized North Atlantic aggressive alliance. However, it soon became clear that the American ruling group simply did not want to leave the initiative of this issue to its British partner, who was trying to strengthen its declining power in Southeast Asia by establishing a Pacific Pact. The American expansionists themselves organized the "movement" to establish a Pacific Pact, with the main roles played by Quirino, Chiang Kai-shek, and Syngman Rhee, the puppet of American militarists in South Korea. They played these roles according to a foreign script.

Izvestia recounted that a month ago, Chiang Kai-shek and Quirino met in the Philippines and immediately announced the formation of an "anti-communist alliance" in the Pacific. Izvestia continued: The American ruling group is trying to explain it in this way: it seems that on the surface, they are being bitterly begged to serve as the leader of the Pacific alliance, but they are hesitant. In fact, Truman's infamous plan to "aid backward areas" has long been put forward as bait, and the United States will definitely use this method to contact the Pacific alliance. This is precisely the plan outlined by Quirino in his speech to the U.S. Congress. However, Quirino is obviously not outstanding in his diplomatic abilities. He immediately stated that this plan is purely temporary, and that American "economic assistance" should arm the Far Eastern reactionaries, and that "economic cooperation" among Asian countries must lead to the formation of military blocs, just as the Marshall Plan paved the way for the North Atlantic Treaty. Quirino has obviously exceeded the role he was assigned to play. Fundamentally, he prematurely revealed that the American ruling group is trying to piece together an aggressive bloc in the Far East, which, like the Atlantic Treaty, violates the United Nations Charter and endangers the interests of peace. The clamor surrounding the Pacific Pact further emphasizes the disastrous failure of American policy in the Far East.

　　忙乱拚凑走狗图建“太平洋公约”
  　美帝远东政策悲惨失败
    消息报评季里诺美国之行
    【新华社北平十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科十六日讯：消息报评论菲律宾总统季里诺美国之行时称：如果不是因为某些情况已经知道，那么，环绕这位“政治家”访问的喧嚣，可能已经引起人们的莫明其妙。这位“政治家”在国际问题上的作用，正如他所领导的国家之“独立”一样地可疑。季里诺到达华盛顿，恰在国务院发表其包含直接供认美国对华政策崩溃的所谓“白皮书”的翌日。根据美国报纸，特别是纽约时报说，这一访问，或更确切地说召菲律宾总统来华盛顿，是与“预料中的对于远东政策的新行动”有关。
    这些“行动”是什么，而这一“政策”又将是什么样子的呢？从一切迹象判断，除了政策破产之外（这种破产现在已由国务院正式承认），不会使美国统治集团获得任何其他结果。因为这种打算是想不要主人，即是说不要远东人民而决定远东人民命运的又一次徒然的努力。
    相当时间之前，当澳大利亚总理齐佛莱在伦敦的公开鼓励下提出组织太平洋公约的建议时，他并未得到华盛顿的支持。美国务院表示：美国并不认为在最近组织北大西洋侵略联盟以外的其他军事政治集团，是一种得策。然而，不久即明白，美国统治集团只是不想把这一问题的倡议，让给其英国的伙伴，后者力图以建立太平洋公约的办法，来加强其在东南亚日益衰落的势力。美国扩张主义者自己组织了建立太平洋公约的“运动”，其主要角色由季里诺以及蒋介石和美国军国主义分子在南朝鲜的傀儡李承晚扮演的。他们按照外国的脚本扮演了这些角色。
    消息报追述一月以前，蒋介石与季里诺曾在菲律宾会晤，随即宣布将在太平洋成立“反共联盟”。消息报继称：美国统治集团试图这样解说：似乎表面上他们是被苦苦哀求担任太平洋联盟领袖，但他们隙犹豫不定。其实，臭名远扬的杜鲁门“援助落后地区”的计划，早已作为诱饵而提出，美国一定会通过这种途径来与太平洋联盟接触。季里诺在美国国会讲演中所概述的正是这个计划。但季里诺显然在外交能力上并不是杰出的，他立即声称：这个计划纯粹是暂时性的，美国的“经济援助”应当武装远东反动派，而亚洲各国的“经济合作”必须导向军事集团的成立，正如马歇尔计划为欧洲的北大西洋公约铺设道路一样。季里诺显然地已超过他被指定担负的作用。根本上说，他过早地泄露了美国统治集团正力图在远东拚凑侵略集团，而这个侵略集团正象大西洋公约一样地违反联合国宪章和危害和平的利益。环绕着太平洋公约的忙乱更加着重地说明了美国在远东政策的惨败。
