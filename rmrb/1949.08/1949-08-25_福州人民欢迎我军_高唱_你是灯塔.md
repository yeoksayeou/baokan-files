Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 23rd. Workers, students, and the broad masses of citizens in Fuzhou warmly welcome the People's Liberation Army. Even before the PLA entered the city, the people of Fuzhou had already posted the prepared "Eight Points of Attention" of the People's Liberation Army and welcoming cartoons and slogans on the streets. On the day before the liberation of Fuzhou, slogans such as "Welcome the People's Liberation Army" and "Punish War Criminals" appeared on the wall near the bandit Fuzhou Pacification Headquarters. On the afternoon of the 17th, after the entire city of Fuzhou was liberated, workers from the electric light plant selected representatives to rush to the outside of the North Gate to greet the PLA troops entering the city. The workers shouted loudly, "Our own troops have arrived!" Students from Fuzhou College, Fuzhou Middle School, and other schools organized a propaganda team of nearly a thousand people, frantically spreading the word on the streets to welcome the PLA. Beside the Drum Tower in the city center, a large banner hung high, reading "Welcome Our Own People's Troops." When the magnificent ranks of the PLA entered the urban area from the north and west in an endless stream, the entire city rejoiced, crowding the roadside to greet them, and setting up tea stalls to treat the PLA. Workers and students stepped forward to surround the PLA, warmly conducting condolences and giving first aid to individual soldiers who fainted from heatstroke. Workers and students denounced the crimes of the Kuomintang bandit gang in conscripting men and forcing them into labor. They said: On the evening of the 16th, before the bandit army fled, they also abducted more than 200 citizens. The citizens unanimously exclaimed excitedly, "With such a powerful army, the entire province of Fujian will soon be liberated!" At 4 p.m., the young students of the city led a large parade to celebrate the liberation with three floats at the front. They puffed out their chests, sang the song "You Are the Beacon," and shouted cheers and salutations to the People's Liberation Army marching alongside them.

　　福州人民欢迎我军
  　高唱“你是灯塔”
    【新华社福州二十三日电】福州市工人、学生和广大市民热烈欢迎人民解放军。当解放军尚未入城时，福州人民就在街头贴出了早已准备好的人民解放军约法八章的布告和欢迎解放军的漫画标语。福州解放的前一天，匪福州绥署附近墙上也出现了：“欢迎人民解放军”、“惩办战争罪犯”等标语。十七日下午福州全市解放后，电灯厂的工人，即选出代表赶至北门外迎接陆续进城的解放军。工人们高声嚷着：“我们自己的队伍来了！”福州学院、福州中学等校学生，组织了近千人的宣传队，在街道上狂热地宣传欢迎解放军。市中心区的鼓楼旁，高挂着“欢迎我们老百姓自己的队伍”的大幅标语。当解放军雄伟的行列源源由北面西面进入市区时，全市万众欢腾，拥挤道旁迎接，并设置茶水站，招待解放军。工人、学生纷纷上前围绕着解放军，热烈进行慰问，并急救个别中暑晕倒的战士，工人和学生们控诉国民党匪帮抓丁拉夫的罪恶。他们说：十六日晚匪军在逃命前还抓走市民二百多人。市民们一致兴奋地说：“有这样强大的军队，不久就可解放全福建！”下午四时，全市青年学生们以三辆彩车为前导，进行庆祝解放的大游行。他们挺起胸膛，高唱出“你是灯塔”的歌声，并向与他们并肩行进的人民解放军高声欢呼致敬。
