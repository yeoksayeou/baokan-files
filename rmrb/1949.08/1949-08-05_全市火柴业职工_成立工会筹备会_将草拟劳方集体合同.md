    Citywide Match Industry Workers
    Establish Union Preparatory Committee
    Will Draft Collective Labor Contract on Behalf of Workers
    [This Municipality News] Over 900 workers in the city's private match industry are actively organizing. The day before yesterday (the 3rd), representatives from various factories held a temporary representative meeting and established a union preparatory committee, electing Yuan Lu, Zhao Zhenbang, and 13 other people as preparatory committee members. In addition to organizing a formal union, the preparatory committee will also draft a collective contract proposal on behalf of the workers to negotiate with the capitalists as a common standard for workers in the city's industry to resolve issues such as wages, working hours, welfare, and labor discipline.
