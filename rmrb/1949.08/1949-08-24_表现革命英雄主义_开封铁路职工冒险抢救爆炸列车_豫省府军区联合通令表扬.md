　　Demonstrating Revolutionary Heroism
  　Kaifeng Railway Workers Risk Lives to Rescue Exploding Train
    Henan Provincial Government and Military Region Issue Joint Circular of Commendation
    [This Dispatch] Kaifeng News: Kaifeng Railway Station worker Cao Mingqian and others bravely rescued ammunition cars that had already exploded, protecting the lives and property of the people at the station. The Henan Provincial Government and Military Region jointly issued a circular of commendation and awarded a bonus of 300,000 Central Bank Notes. The details of the incident are as follows: On the 5th of this month, five ammunition cars were driven from Shangqiu to Kaifeng Station. Car No. 1256 suddenly started to emit smoke due to exposure to the scorching sun. Transfer worker Xuan Cheng discovered this and immediately notified the station. Stationmaster Liu Qinglan immediately mobilized for rescue while ordering switchman Mu Jidiao to urgently dispatch a locomotive to pull the cars away. Switchman Cao Mingqian, off-duty Deputy Stationmaster Wang Mingjiu, driver Zhang Fuzhe, stokers Wang Chengxin, Dai Jingui, transfer worker Xuan Cheng, assistant Wang Jian and other employees bravely moved the smoking ammunition car out of the station. The car derailed midway, and the shells began to explode. Cao Mingqian and others risked their lives to re-couple the car twice, quickly dragging it to an open space outside the station. Only when the shells began to explode violently did Cao and the others leave the car and quickly drove the locomotive away, avoiding it. This prevented loss of life and property to the people at the station. The Henan Daily published an editorial on the 16th of this month, calling on the military and civilians of the province to promote revolutionary heroism, and "cherish the property of the people and the motherland." The editorial pointed out that the heroic and responsible actions of the employees of Kaifeng Station in rescuing the exploding vehicles, and their enormous contribution in saving the people's lives and property from disaster, demonstrated the working class and the revolutionary cadres' infinite loyalty to the people's cause and the revolutionary spirit of highly cherishing the property of the people and the motherland. The highest expression of this spirit is revolutionary heroism, which is the most valuable quality of the working people in the new society, and is worthy of serious study by all employees and all revolutionary workers.
