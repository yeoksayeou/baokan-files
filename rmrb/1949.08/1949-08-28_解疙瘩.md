　　In early spring, the villagers were all looking for partners to form mutual aid teams. After the land reform, the people's enthusiasm for production was much greater than in previous years.

　　Liu Dayou and old man Li Erniu also discussed forming a mutual aid team. At that time, the Farmers' Association Director Li Hehe said, "It couldn't be more suitable for you two to form a mutual aid team!" Everyone said, "This mutual aid team will definitely be successful!" Old man Li Erniu and Liu Dayou also happily said, "We are both willing, no one is forcing anyone!"

　　Old man Li Erniu was a well-to-do middle peasant, cultivating nearly thirty mu of land. He used to have an ox and a donkey, but the ox died of illness last winter, and now he only has a donkey left. Liu Dayou was a newly liberated peasant, who received a donkey during the land reform, cultivating about twenty-five or six mu of land. The two had similar amounts of land, the same amount of labor, lived in the same courtyard, and usually got along well. It was indeed impossible to find a more suitable mutual aid team than these two.

　　But things in the world are really unpredictable. Such a suitable mutual aid team, before even ten days had passed, suddenly went up like a deaf man's firecracker: it fell apart.

　　The matter happened very strangely: Early that morning, Liu Dayou was tidying up the coal he had brought back yesterday in the yard. Li Erniu came out of his house, tightening his belt as he said, "Let's plant the three mu of spring wheat in my long field today!" Liu Dayou said, "Okay! I'll sow the seeds." Who knew that Li Erniu walked to the animal trough and looked at it, his face suddenly changed, and he angrily turned around and said to Liu Dayou, "Damn it! Mutual aid, no more mutual aid. Let's each take care of our own from now on!" Liu Dayou was stunned for a long time, not knowing what had happened. Watching old man Li Erniu carry his plow and seed bag, pulling his donkey, and left without looking back. Liu Dayou also muttered angrily, "No more mutual aid, so what! I can still get by without your help! My land won't go to waste without you!"

　　The Farmers' Association Director Li Hehe was filling in the gully washed away by the water last year in the field this morning, and he finished before noon. He carried his shovel back, and from afar saw old man Li Erniu, planting the land alone with a donkey. He saw him leading the donkey to plow to the north end, stopping the donkey, and then running back empty-handed to the south end, setting up a manure basket to sow seeds; after sowing to the north end, he put down the manure basket, picked up the whip, and turned the donkey back to plow towards the south end... Li Hehe found it very strange, and quickly ran over, taking three steps at a time, and asked, "Uncle Erniu, why are you planting alone?!" Li Erniu said, "Hmm!" Li Hehe asked, "Where's Liu Dayou?" Li Erniu twisted his neck and said, "Don't know!" Li Hehe heard a hint of anger in his words, and figured that a problem had occurred, but he didn't know what the problem was. He knew Li Erniu's stubborn temper: He never said anything if he was dissatisfied with someone, just kept it in his stomach. If you asked him directly, he wouldn't say a word for three days and three nights. Li Hehe didn't say anything else at this time, just said, "Uncle Erniu, I'll help you plant!" Li Erniu just plowed his land, not saying yes, nor saying no. Li Hehe didn't care whether he wanted him to or not, he stuck the shovel in the ground, set up a manure basket, and followed him to sow seeds. Neither of them said a word.

　　After working for a while, old man Li Erniu stopped and said, "Let's have a smoke!" Li Hehe also put down the manure basket, took out his pipe, and the two of them sat on the ground, striking flint to light their cigarettes. Li Hehe, smoking, said, "It's so awkward to plow and sow by yourself, why did you two break up after doing so well together?" Li Erniu said, "It's impossible to continue! Who wouldn't want to continue if they could!" Li Hehe said, "I don't think Liu Dayou is the kind of person who likes to take advantage and not suffer losses, he's quite honest!" Li Erniu said, "It's not about whether he's a good person or not. If I continue to work with him, my donkey will die!" Li Hehe quickly asked, "What?!" Li Erniu said, "What? He doesn't care about the animals! He doesn't understand anything, but he insists on feeding the animals. He always fills the trough with grass before going to bed, and doesn't get up at night to check if they're eating. Think about it: Are you more comfortable eating three meals a day, or eating one big meal a day? Besides, he never sifts the sand and dirt out of the grass when he feeds the animals. When I see him doing that, I want to sprinkle a handful of dirt into his rice bowl and let him taste it: See if it tastes better with dirt or without dirt?" Li Hehe smiled and said, "That's the truth."

　　Li Erniu, seeing that Li Hehe agreed with his opinion, continued, "He doesn't let the animals roll in the dirt after working, nor does he let them rest, he immediately ties them to the trough. When plowing, he always complains that the animals are walking too slowly, and whips them to death, as if he doesn't feel sorry for them! Animals can't talk, if they could, they would have gone to the yamen to sue him!" Old man Li Erniu spoke these words with a serious face, and Li Hehe almost laughed. After a pause, he asked, "Is he only treating your donkey like that? Or is he treating his donkey the same way?" Li Erniu said, "He treats everyone the same, that's what I can't stand. I used to put up with it, feeling sorry for my own animal and not saying anything, afraid of hurting the harmony between the two families. Today I can't stand it anymore! Last night he drove the two donkeys to carry a load of coal, and didn't even put a saddle pad, and crushed the donkeys' backs!" Saying that, he jumped up, pointed to the broken spot on the donkey's back and showed it to Li Hehe, and said, "Working with him for eight or nine days, my donkey has lost ten pounds of meat." Li Hehe said, "Are there any other problems?" Li Erniu said, "There are no other problems, anyway, I'm not going to work with him anymore, if I do, I'll lose my capital!"

　　Li Hehe kept what he said in his heart, didn't say anything else to his face, and helped him plant until noon when they stopped work.

　　In the afternoon, Li Hehe didn't go to the field, but wanted to talk to Liu Dayou. When he walked to Liu Dayou's door, Liu Dayou was there mixing mud to plaster the back wall. Li Hehe said, "Why aren't you planting the land, doing these unimportant things?" Liu Dayou said, "I asked all over the village this morning, but I couldn't borrow a plow!" Li Hehe said, "Why didn't you continue working with old man Li Erniu!" Liu Dayou, hearing the question about the mutual aid team, stopped his work and squatted on the ground, feeling wronged, and said, "He doesn't want to continue, it's not that I don't want to continue!" Li Hehe also squatted down and said, "Do you know why?" Liu Dayou spread out his hands and said, "I haven't crawled into his stomach to see, who knows why? This morning he said everything was fine, he was going to plant spring wheat for him, who knew that after a while, he said: 'Damn it, mutual aid, no more mutual aid, let's each take care of our own!' When he came back from planting this morning, his donkey wouldn't even be tied to the same trough as mine, and I'm still in the dark!" After a pause, he said, "You always say in meetings that we are Party members, and we must act first and enjoy later, suffer more losses ourselves, and not take advantage of others. I thought about it all morning, and I've been working with him for eight or nine days, and I've never thought of taking advantage of him. I always rushed to manage the animals and do the hard work because he's old and a military dependent. I always give him priority in planting whatever crops. I don't know what I've offended him!" After speaking, he lowered his head, as if he was full of grievances.

　　Li Hehe said, "I know all this. Hmm! Have you ever raised animals before?" Liu Dayou felt the question was a bit strange, and quickly said, "Brother Hehe, why are you asking this? You know my background, I've been herding sheep and doing odd jobs since I was a child, when have I ever raised an animal!" Li Hehe said, "Do you know how to feed them?" Liu Dayou said, "This isn't a difficult skill, who doesn't know how to feed an animal, even if I haven't eaten pork, I've seen pigs run!?" Li Hehe clapped his hands and said, "That's right, your shortcoming is right there." He then told Liu Dayou about Li Erniu's complaints, and said, "We Communists must learn from others anytime and anywhere. When it comes to raising animals and planting land, old man Li Erniu has decades of experience, which is much more skillful than you. You should always ask him for advice!" Liu Dayou understood after hearing this, and quickly said, "So that's why! Speaking of this, that is indeed my shortcoming. Li Erniu loves his animals, his ox was sick last winter, he stayed up all night guarding the trough, and cried for several days after it died."

　　Li Hehe said, "I think this problem is easy to solve. Tonight, let's have a small meeting, you make a self-criticism, and then continue the mutual aid. You should also think about what your shortcomings are, and what advantages others have?" Liu Dayou said, "Okay, don't worry, I can do it!"

　　That evening, at dinner time, Li Hehe came to Li Erniu's yard with a bowl. He saw Li Erniu also eating dinner in the yard. Li Hehe said, "Uncle Erniu, have you finished planting the spring wheat?" Li Erniu said, "No, there's still more than one mu left!" Saying that, he handed Li Hehe a small stool. Liu Dayou, hearing the voices in the yard, also came out with a bowl, saying, "Look! It's mealtime for everyone!" Li Erniu didn't say anything, and drank his porridge with his head lowered. Liu Dayou didn't care, took a small stool and sat down as well.

　　Old man Li Erniu looked at the situation and said, "What, are you going to hold a meeting to criticize me? Criticize me, anyway, I won't change my mind!" Li Hehe smiled and said, "Look at what you're saying, can this matter be criticized in a meeting? Mutual aid is voluntary, and cannot be forced at all. The collapse of the mutual aid team can only be blamed on my poor leadership, failing to help solve problems at any time." Liu Dayou took the opportunity to say, "The collapse of our mutual aid team can't be blamed on you at all!" Li Erniu drank his porridge with his head lowered, making a lot of noise, indicating that he didn't want to listen. Liu Dayou didn't care about him, and continued, "This matter is all my fault. I've been herding sheep and doing odd jobs since I was a child, and I'm an amateur at planting land and raising animals. Uncle Erniu has been a peasant for decades, and has a lot of experience in planting land and raising animals, but I, standing in front of a master, stubbornly refuse to ask him for advice, and only rely on my own stupid ideas, cutting the grass too long, feeding it to the animals with dirt, and not diligently cleaning the animal pen. When plowing, the plow is crooked, and instead of admitting that my skills are not good, I just beat the animals!"

　　Old man Erniu's hand holding the rice bowl stopped, and he quietly listened, stroking his beard with the other hand. The women of the two families also slowly gathered around.

　　Liu Dayou continued, "Just take yesterday's coal carrying as an example, I didn't know how to put on a saddle pad, and I didn't ask Uncle Erniu for advice, afraid that people would say, 'You're a peasant, and you don't even know how to put on a saddle pad!' I messed around on my own, and as a result, the backs of both donkeys were worn out, which made Uncle Erniu angry with me, and he has every right to be angry! Putting myself in his shoes! Anyone would feel the same way!"

　　Old man Li Erniu originally didn't plan to speak, but hearing that Liu Dayou was speaking very sincerely, he thought that the man usually worked very honestly, just that he treated the animals too badly! But he really didn't understand, it wasn't intentional. He also thought that he hadn't given him any advice, and that was wrong of him too. Since the man had taken all the blame, he felt a little guilty. He couldn't help but say, "I'm also at fault!" Li Hehe said, "From what I hear, Dayou is mostly at fault: he doesn't understand, and he hasn't studied hard enough!"

　　Liu Dayou's wife (the head of the women's association's group) said, "We are new households, and we have to learn everything from others, and we have to rely on others for help. Just take our living in this courtyard as an example, all the pots, pans, bowls, and dishes, what hasn't Aunt Erniu helped with!" Aunt Erniu said, "What are you saying, Sister Liu! People often say that a close neighbor is better than a distant relative, haven't we troubled you with many things in our family, I can't afford to pay you for the work!" Liu Dayou said, "We're the ones who benefited from you more, today we didn't work with Uncle Erniu, and we didn't borrow a plow for the whole day." Old man Erniu continued, "I still couldn't manage it alone today! Taking care of this end and neglecting the other. We used to be able to plant four or five mu a day together, today even with Hehe helping me for a while, I didn't even plant two mu." His wife said, "You two had a quarrel today! I said my old man has been pouting his lips all day!" Liu Dayou said, "We didn't argue, it's mainly my fault..." Old man Li Erniu interrupted and said, "It's mainly my bad temper. Dayou isn't the kind of person who likes to be lazy and take advantage of others, he always gives me priority in planting whatever crops. It's mainly about feeding the animals, using the animals, these animals..." Saying that, he stood up, walked to the trough, and stroked both his donkey and Liu Dayou's donkey, while continuing, "If you don't feed these animals well, they won't work well for you. Our troops live in the courtyard, and the comrades like to say that guns are their lives. Animals are the lives of us peasants. They are things that can't talk, they won't say when they're hungry, thirsty, or in pain. That requires us to put our hearts into figuring it out, just like women raising children. How much do the animals earn back for us in a year? We can't be as stingy as landlords are to their laborers!" Liu Dayou and Li Hehe both nodded and said, "These are words from the heart." Liu Dayou said, "I didn't understand this principle before, I only thought that it was enough to feed them well enough to use them!" Old man Li Erniu said, "I know my bad temper, now it's time for democracy, if you have any opinions about me, please raise them!" Li Hehe said, "You treat people very kindly, but you don't say anything if you have opinions about people, you keep them to yourself and endure them, and when you can't bear it anymore, you explode and catch others off guard. You should say what you think. Criticize when you see something wrong." Aunt Erniu also said, "Sometimes he gets angry with us too, and his face changes so much that it's scary, no one can figure out why, and he won't say a word even if you ask him to death, he really has a strange temper." Old man Erniu laughed and said, "Hey, hey, hey, that's my shortcoming, I'll change it in the future!"

　　Li Hehe saw that the dispute was resolved, and there was no problem with the mutual aid team, stood up and stretched. He said, "Go to sleep, go to the field early tomorrow." Old man Erniu said, "This meeting was a good one!" Li Hehe said, "I came to visit, not to hold a meeting!" Old man Erniu laughed and said, "Hey, hey, hey, now you cadres are coming up with ways to make everyone work well together in mutual aid production, this can also be considered a meeting!" Everyone laughed at what he said.

　　In the middle of the night, when old man Erniu got up to feed the animals, he saw that Liu Dayou was also in front of his trough, using a grass sieve to sift grass for the donkeys. Old man Erniu suddenly felt warm in his heart, went over and took a look, and said, "Let's plant your three mu of peas first tomorrow, and then plant the rest of my spring wheat!"

    烽马
    一开春，村里庄户人都在自找对象闹变工。土地改革以后，人们闹生产的劲头，比往年可大的多了。
    刘大有和李二牛老汉，也商量着搿伙闹变工，当时农会主任李和和说：“你们两家闹变工，这是再合适也不能了！”众人们都说：“他们这变工一定能变好！”李二牛老汉和刘大有也高兴的说：“我们这对象都是两情两愿，谁也没强迫谁！”
    李二牛老汉是老户中农，养种着不到些三十亩地，以前喂着一头牛一条驴，去年冬天牛病死了，如今只剩下了一条驴；刘大有是新翻身户，土地改革中分到一条驴，养种着二十五六亩地，两个人土地亩数相差不多，劳动力一样，又是住在一个院里，平素相处的也不错。这样两家闹变工，的确是再合适也不能了。
    可是天下的事真说不定。这样合适的变工组，没变了十天，忽然聋子放炮：散了。
    事情发生的很奇怪：这天大清早，刘大有正在院里收拾昨天驮回来的炭，李二牛从家里出来了，一面紧腰带，一面说道：“今天咱们种我长畛那三亩春麦吧！”刘大有说：“行！我给咱撒籽。”谁知李二牛走到牲口槽跟前看了看，脸色突然变了，怒悻悻地返过身来对刘大有说：“球！变工，不变了。咱们以后各管各吧！”刘大有楞了半天，不知出了什事。看着李二牛老汉背起犁和籽种布袋，拉着他的那头驴，头也不回的走了。刘大有也气恨恨地嘟哝道：“不变拉球倒，变工我还能沾了你的光！离了你我的地也荒不下！”
    农会主任李和和，这天上午在地里填去年水冲下的壕，还没到晌午头就填完了。他扛着锹往回走，远远了见李二牛老汉，一个人赶着一条驴种地，只见他赶着驴耕到北头，把驴停住了，又空手跑回南头，架起粪筐撒籽；撒到北头了，又把粪筐放下，拿起鞭子回过驴来，往南头耕……………李和和看着很奇怪，忙三步并作两步跑过来问道：“二牛叔，怎你一个人种？！”李二牛说：“嗯！”李和和问道：“刘大有哩？”李二牛一扭脖子说：“不知道！”李和和听出话里带些气，心里盘算见是发生问题了，可是又不知道是什问题。他知道李二牛那牛脾气：他对谁不满意，从来嘴上不说，只是闷在肚里，你要去直问他，他三天三夜也不会吐一个字。李和和这时也没说别的话，只是说：“二牛叔，我来帮你种！”李二牛只是耕他的地，没说要，也没说不要。李和和也没管他要不要，把锹一插，架起粪筐跟在他后边就撒籽。两个人谁没说一句话。
    干了一阵活，李二牛老汉停下来说：“抽袋烟吧！”李和和也放下粪筐，掏出烟袋来，两个人坐在地上，打着火石点着烟。李和和一面抽烟，一面说道：“一个人又耕又种多不顺手，怎你们变得好好地又不变了？”李二牛说：“变不成吧！能变成谁还不愿意变！”李和和说：“我看刘大有也不是那爱沾便宜不吃亏的人，为人也挺老实！”李二牛说：“不是说他人好坏。我要再和他变下去，我的驴就要变死了！”李和和忙问说：“怎？！”李二牛说：“怎？他不心疼牲口吧！本来自己什也不球懂，能的要喂牲口。老是临睡觉填上一槽草，吃不吃黑夜就不起来了，你想想：咱们一天分开吃上三顿饭肚里舒坦？还是一天狠狠吃上一顿舒坦？再说，他喂牲口从来不筛一下草里的砂子土，我看到他这样做，就想给他饭碗里撒把土，让他尝尝：看有土好吃还是没土好吃？”李和和笑了笑说：“这倒是实情话。”
    李二牛见李和和同意他的意见了，接着又说道：“做活回来也不给牲口打滚，也不让歇一歇，马上就拴到槽上了。耕起地来，老嫌牲口走的慢，死命甩鞭子，知道他不疼吆！牲口是不会说话，要会说话，早到衙门里告他去了！”李二牛老汉讲着这些话，脸上一板正经，李和和恰听得差点笑出来。停了一下又问道：“他光是对你的驴这样？还是对他的也是这样？”李二牛说：“对谁的也是这样，就这我就看不忿，以前我忍着，自己心疼没啃声，怕伤了两家的和气，今天我再也忍不住了！夜天他赶着两个驴驮了一回炭，连个鞍子也垫不了，把驴脊梁都压烂了！”说着跳了起来，指着驴背上压破的地方给李和和看，并说：“和他变了八九天工，我的驴总瘦十斤肉。”李和和说：“还有别的问题没？”李二牛说：“别的倒没有，反正不变了，再变下去还要折了我的老本哩！”
    李和和把他谈的记在心里，当面也没说别的话，一直帮他种到晌午收工。
    下午，李和和没上地，想去找刘大有谈谈。走到刘大有门口时，刘大有正在那里和泥抹后墙，李和和说：“怎你不去种地，做这些有要没紧的事？”刘大有说：“上午全村问遍了，也借不下张犁！”李和和说：“怎不和李二牛老汉变了！”刘大有听到问变工的事，停了手里的营生，蹲在地上受屈似的说：“人家不变了，又不是咱不变！”李和和也蹲下来说：“你知道是因什？”刘大有摊开两手说：“咱又没钻到人家肚里看，谁知道是因什？今天一早起来还说的好好地给他种春麦，谁知过了一阵，人家说：‘球，变工，不变了，咱们各管各吧！’上午种地回来，他的驴也不和我的驴往一个槽上拴了，至这阵咱还装在闷葫芦里咧！”停了一下又说：“你开会一说就是咱们是党员，凡事要作在先，享受在后，自己多吃点亏，不要占便宜。我今天思谋了一上午，我和他变工八九天了，从来也没思谋要占他的便宜，咱因他上年岁了，又是军属，老是自己抢着经管牲口，挑苦重的干，种什庄稼也是先尽他。咱不知什上头得罪下他了！”说完低下了头，好象有满肚子委屈。
    李和和说：“这些我也知道。唔！你以前养过牲口没有？”刘大有觉得问的有点奇怪，忙说：“和和哥，你问这些做什？你又不是不知道我的底子，咱从小放羊打短工，什时养过个牲口！”李和和说：“会喂不会喂？”刘大有说：“这又不是什的难手艺，谁还不会喂个牲口，没吃过猪肉还没见过猪跑！？”李和和把手一拍说：“对了，你的缺点就在这上头。”随即把李二牛对他的意见说了一遍，并说：“咱们共产党员，随时随地要向别人学习，说到养牲口种地，李二牛老汉几十年的老经验了，比你老练的多，应当时时刻刻向人家领教！”刘大有听罢，肚里也明亮了，忙说：“原来就为这事呀！说到这上头，这倒确实是我的缺点。李二牛老汉对牲口就是爱，去年冬天他的牛病了，整夜守在槽跟前，死了以后哭了好几天。”
    李和和说：“我看这问题好解决，今晚上咱们开个小会，你检讨检讨，还是再变起来。你也想想，看自己还有什缺点，人家有什好处？”刘大有说：“行，你放心吧，这我能办到！”
    这天晚上，吃夜饭的时候，李和和端着碗到李二牛家院里来了，只见李二牛也正在院里吃夜饭，李和和说：“二牛叔，春麦种完了？”李二牛说：“没，还空有一亩多！”说着递给李和和个小板凳。刘大有听着院里说话，也端着碗出来了，说：“喏！真是一家饭时都饭时！”李二牛没啃气，低着头喝稀饭。刘大有没在意，拿了个小板凳也坐了过来。
    李二牛老汉看了看阵势说：“怎，这是要开会斗争我啦，斗吧，反正说成什我也是不变了！”李和和笑着说：“看你说到那里了，这事还能开会斗争？变工这是自愿，一点也不能强迫。变工组垮了，这只能怪我领导的不好，不能随时帮助解决问题。”刘大有趁势接上说：“我们这变工组垮了，这一点也不能怪你！”李二牛低着头喝稀饭，弄出很大响声，表示不愿意听的样子。刘大有没管他，继续说道：“这事都怪我，咱从小揽羊打短工，种地养牲口都是外行。二牛叔几十年的老庄户了，有的是种地养牲口经验，可是面前站下老师父，咱偏不向人家领教，光是自出肚才胡闹腾，给牲口铡草铡得圪节挺长，喂时候连土喂，牲口圈也不勤垫。耕起地来犁歪了，不说自己把式不行，光是打牲口！”
    二牛老汉端着饭碗的手停住了，另一只手摸着胡子悄悄地听。两家的女人们也慢慢围了过来。
    刘大有接着又说道：“就说昨天驮炭吧，自己本来不会垫鞍子，也不向二牛叔领教，怕人说‘你个庄户人，连个鞍子也不会垫！’自己胡闹腾，结果驮炭回来，把两个驴的脊梁都磨烂了，惹得二牛叔生我的气，这气生的就对着哩！将心比心吆！跌到谁头上也一样！”
    李二牛老汉本来打算不开口，可是听见刘大有讲的很诚恳，想起人家平时受苦也挺老实，就是对牲口太不好了！不过他是真不懂，不是故意。又想到：自己没给开说过，也有不是。人家把不是都揽起了，心里有点过意不去。不由得说道：“我也有不是！”李和和说：“以我听来，主要还是大有的不是多：自己不懂，又没好好学习！”
    刘大有婆姨（妇女会的小组长）说：“咱新立门户的人家，什事也得向人学，什事也得靠人家帮助，就说我们住到这院里吧，一切锅盆碗盏，什不是人家二牛婶帮助！”二牛婶说：“你刘大嫂说的什话！人常说远亲不如近邻，我们家好多事情还不是麻烦你，要算起工钱来，我可给不起了！”刘大有说：“还是我们沾你们的光多，今天没和二牛叔变工，一天也没借下张犁。”二牛老汉接上说道：“我今天一个人还不是没法弄！顾了这头误了那头，以前两个人一天能种四五亩，今天还是和和帮了我一阵，连二亩也没种了。”他老婆说：“今天你们是闹了嘴舌啦！我说我家这老汉噘了一天嘴！”刘大有说：“也没吵架，主要是怪……”李二牛老汉强着说：“主要是怪我这灰脾气。大有也不是那要奸使懒爱沾便宜的人，种什庄稼老是先尽我。主要是喂牲口，使用牲口，这牲口……”他说着站起来，走到槽跟前，把他的驴和刘大有的驴，都抚摸了一下，一面继续说道：“这牲口喂不好，它就不会给你好好动弹，咱们院里住下队伍，同志们爱说枪是他们的命。牲口可就是咱庄户人的命。它是个不会说话的东西，它饥了渴了，疼了痛了，不会说。这就要咱们下心苦捉摸，象女人们带养小孩一样。牲口一年给咱往回赚多少？咱不能象地主对长工那样克薄！”刘大有和李和和都点着头说：“这是骨子里的话。”刘大有说：“咱以前可没翻清这个理，只说喂饱能用就对了！”李二牛老汉说：“我知道我这灰脾气，这阵时与民主，你们对我有什意见，也提提！”李和和说：“你处人挺厚道，不过就是对人有意见不说，放在自己肚子里忍，忍不住爆出来，就叫别人个吃不倒。应当是有意见就说。看见不对就批评。”二牛婶也说：“有时和我们生了气也是那样，嘴脸变的怕人，谁也摸不着因什，问死也不说一句，真是个怪脾气。”二牛老汉笑着说：“嗨嗨嗨，这是我的缺点，以后也要改改！”
    李和和看看疙瘩算解开了，变工是不成问题了，站起来伸了个懒腰说：“睡吧，明天早点上地。”二牛老汉说：“今天这会开得好！”李和和说：“我是来串门子的，可不是来开会的哇！”二牛老汉笑着说：“嗨嗨嗨，如今你们当干部的，变着法子想让大家好好变工生产，这也算是开会！”说得众人都笑了。
    半夜里，二牛老汉起来喂牲口的时候，只见刘大有也在他的槽前拿草筛给驴筛草。二牛老汉心里忽然感到热呼呼地，过去看了一眼说：“明天先种你那三亩豌豆，完了再捎种我剩下的那点春麦吧！”
