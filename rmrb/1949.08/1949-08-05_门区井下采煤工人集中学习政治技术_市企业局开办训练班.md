    Coal Miners in Mentougou Concentrate on Studying Politics and Technology
    Municipal Enterprise Bureau Opens Training Class
    [Report from this newspaper] To improve the political understanding and production skills of coal miners working underground, the Municipal Enterprise Bureau has opened a training class in Mentougou for concentrated study. The study period is nine weeks. The main courses include: the history of social development, basic issues of the Chinese revolution, trade union work, and vocational studies (such as drilling and blasting, support and shed construction, and other coal mining techniques). Three hundred and twenty young and middle-aged workers from Mentougou Mine, Xishan Mine, and Chengzi Mine, who are actively engaged in production and willing to work in the coal mine for a long time, are enrolled in the class. Classes officially started on August 1st.
    Since liberation, trade unions in various mines and streets have opened spare-time study classes for employees. Generally speaking, few underground coal miners participate. For example, of the 78 people who participated in the study class opened by Mentougou Mine in June, only two-tenths were underground coal miners. The number of underground coal miners participating in the study was less than one percent of all underground coal miners. Recently, during the summer vacation, students went to the mine to help workers study, but few underground coal miners participated, and later they could not persist and fewer and fewer came. The main reason for this situation is that underground coal mining is too hard, and after coming out of the mine, a longer rest period is needed, and they have to cook their own meals, which takes up a lot of time. The leadership of cultural and educational cadres is not concentrated. The Mentougou district paid close attention to worker study in April, May and June, with large mine trade unions and small kiln street trade unions all engaging in this work, but the cadre strength was dispersed, and few achieved good results. Based on the above experience, after exchanging opinions from all sides, the Municipal Enterprise Bureau decided to open a worker training class in the Mentougou district. More than a dozen experienced cadres were drawn from the Enterprise Bureau, the Pingxi Coal Mine Company, the District Federation of Trade Unions, and other agencies to form the leadership of the training class, to unify and concentrate on doing a good job in the political and technical study of coal miners. The workers participating in the training class were also organized into squadrons and groups, living and eating together, improving group life and becoming more regularized, overcoming the previous scattered and disorganized phenomenon. During the study period, workers are detached from production, and each mine is paid wages according to standard rates (approximately 200+ catties of millet per month).

### 门区井下采煤工人集中学习政治技术  市企业局开办训练班

    门区井下采煤工人集中学习政治技术
    市企业局开办训练班
    【本报讯】为了提高井下采煤工人的政治认识和生产技术，市企业局特在门头沟开设了集中学习的工人训练班，学习期间为九个星期，课程主要的有：社会发展史，中国革命基本问题，工会工作和业务学习（如打眼放炮，支柱架棚等采煤技术）。入班学习的有门矿、西山、城子三矿中生产积极和愿意长期在煤矿工作的青壮年工人共三百二十人，八月一日正式开学上课。
    解放以后，各矿各街工会都开设职工业余学习班，一般的说，井下采煤工人参加的很少，如门头沟矿六月开办的学习班，参加的七十八人中，井下采煤工人只占十分之二，参加学习的井下采煤工人还不到全体井下采煤工人的百分之一。最近暑期中，学生到矿里帮助工人学习，井下采煤工人参加的也很少，后来不能坚持，越来越少了。发生这种情形的主要原因，是井下采煤工作太苦，上井后，需要较长的休息时间，又要自己煮饭，占去许多时间。领导学习的文教干部力量又不集中，门头沟区在四、五、六月曾很注意工人学习，大矿工会搞，小窑的街工会也搞，干部力量分散，搞得好的也就少。根据上面的经验，经过各方面交换意见，市企业局乃决定在门头沟区开办工人训练班，由企业局、平西煤矿公司、区工会等机关抽调了十几个有经验的干部，组成训练班的领导机构，统一集中的搞好煤矿工人的政治技术学习，参加训练班的工友也编成中队、小组，集体住，集体吃饭，健全小组生活，正规化起来，克服了过去散漫无组织的现象。工人在学习期间脱离生产，由各矿按照标准数发给工资（每月约二百多斤小米）。
