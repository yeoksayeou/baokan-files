Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 26th: TASS, New York, August 22nd: According to American newspapers, the U.S. State Department, panicked by the complete failure of its China policy, is currently formulating new plans to expand American influence in the Far East. According to the Wall Street Journal of August 6th, Secretary of State Acheson has established a special committee to draft a new U.S. policy towards the Far East. The paper wrote that the main principles of this policy are already well-defined for the State Department and military experts, namely, the new Far East policy will have the same goals as the North Atlantic Treaty. To meet these objectives, the military will play a major role in drafting the Far East policy. Experts are preparing new plans for American "military aid" to be submitted to Congress for approval, as this new plan will require the United States to allocate large sums of money. In this regard, the State Department hopes to gain support from some members of Congress who favor direct or indirect assistance to China or Far Eastern countries such as the Philippines. The paper also pointed out that Truman's plan for so-called "economic development of backward areas" will first be used to fund the new U.S. policy of expansion in the Far East. The New York Times stated that the "idea" of using funds that Congress might allocate to implement the aforementioned Truman plan to prevent the development of communism in countries bordering China is often discussed. It is generally believed that this is a cold war strategy that may be adopted in this region. In drafting the new U.S. policy of aggression against the Far East, the American press mentioned the speech delivered by former commander of the U.S. occupation forces in Japan, the Eighth Army, Eichelberger, at the American Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Columbus, Ohio. Eichelberger urged the arming of Japan and turning it into an American "ally" in the event of war. Eichelberger's words caused a great reaction in Japan, encouraging militaristic sentiments. The Daily News wrote with satisfaction: "Japan is already standing on the front line of the anti-communist front." The Yomiuri Shimbun pointed out that the U.S. military strategic policy in the Far East includes Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and India. The paper pointed out that the new U.S. plan for expansion in the Far East is closely related to the preparation of the so-called Pacific Alliance. It is well known that the President of the Philippines, during his visit to Washington, held discussions with American politicians regarding the conclusion of such an alliance. According to various newspapers, the United States wants to establish a Pacific Alliance based on "Southeast Asian countries, including Australia and New Zealand." American and British newspapers point out that the issue of Far East policy will be raised for discussion during the talks between Bevin and Acheson to be held in Washington in September, as the new U.S. plan has caused anxiety in London. A British Observer reporter recently reported from Washington that during this negotiation, the United States may require Britain to guarantee that Britain's future political activities in the Far East must comply with U.S. policy.

　　侵华政策完全失败陷于惊慌
  　美帝策动远东新阴谋
    图建包括澳纽在内的“太平洋联盟”，英帝极感不安。
    【新华社北平二十六日电】塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：据美国报纸载称：为对华政策完全失败而陷于惊慌的美国国务院，刻正拟制扩张美国在远东势力的新计划。据华尔街日报八月六日报道：美国务卿艾奇逊已设立了一个特别委员会，草拟美国对远东的新政策。该报写道：这个政策的主要原则对国务院及军事专家们说来，业已成竹在胸，即新的远东政策将与北大西洋公约具有同样的目标。为着符合此等目的，军人们将在草拟远东政策中起着重大的作用。专家们刻正准备美国“军事援助”的新计划，以备咨请国会通过，因为这个新计划将需要美国拨出大批的款项。在这一方面，国务院期望自那些赞成直接或间接援助中国或菲律宾等远东国家的若干国会议员方面，获得支持。该报并指出，关于所谓“发展落后地区经济”的杜鲁门方案，将首先用以资助美国在远东扩张的新政策。纽约时报称：关于利用国会可能为实行上述杜鲁门方案而拨出的款项，来阻止共产主义在中国毗邻各国发展的“念头”，时常被谈论着。一般认为这是在这一地区中可能采取的冷战战略。在草拟美国对远东侵略政策的新计划方面，美国报界提及美国前驻日占领军第八军军长艾契柏格在俄亥俄州哥伦布的美国参加海外作战退役军人大会上所发表的演说。艾契柏格力促武装日本，并且把它变成一旦战争发生时美国的“盟邦”。艾契柏格的话，在日本引起了很大的反响，鼓励了军国主义者的情绪。每日新闻满意地写道：“日本已经站在反共阵线的火线上了。”读卖新闻指出：美国在远东的军事战略政策，把日本、台湾、菲律宾和印度一样地包括在内。该报指出，美国在远东扩张的新计划，与所谓太平洋联盟的准备，息息相关。尽人皆知，菲律宾总统在其访问华盛顿期间，曾与美国政治家们进行关于缔结此种联盟的商谈。据各报称，美国想以“包括澳大利亚及纽西兰在内的东南亚国家为基础”，建立太平洋联盟。美英各报指出，在将于九月间在华盛顿举行的贝文与艾奇逊间的商谈中，远东政策的问题将被提出讨论，因为美国的新计划已引起了伦敦方面的不安。英国观察报记者最近自华盛顿报道称，在这个商谈中，美国或将要英国保证：英国将来在远东的政治活动必须符合美国的政策。
