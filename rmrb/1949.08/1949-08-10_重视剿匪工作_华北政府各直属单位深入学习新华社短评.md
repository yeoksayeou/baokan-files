    Emphasizing the Work of Suppressing Bandits
    Subordinate Units of the North China Government Deeply Study Xinhua News Agency's Short Commentary
    [Our Newspaper] The various departments and directly subordinate units of the North China People's Government are now actively studying Xinhua News Agency's two short commentaries, "Eliminate Complacency and Extinguish Special Agent Bandits" and "Protect the People's Motherland's Property." This study began on August 5th and follows the previous study of "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." In a notice issued to the various sub-study committees a few days ago, the Government Study Committee requested that each department not only organize in-depth discussions but also formulate specific measures for implementing these two tasks. At 6:30 PM on the 5th, Yang Qiqing, Minister of Public Security of the North China People's Government, gave a special lecture to more than 1,200 cadres of the entire government, explaining the importance of studying these two documents. Minister Yang pointed out to everyone that although the open enemies in North China have been eliminated, hidden enemies still exist. Therefore, we should not be complacent in the slightest. We should maintain this vigilance until classes are eliminated; otherwise, it will lead to unnecessary losses. Minister Yang explained the activities of the remaining special agent bandits in various places and said: We have achieved great results in eliminating special agents, but in order to thoroughly eliminate special agents, we must strengthen this work in the future. He hopes that everyone will overcome the past erroneous view of regarding the elimination of bandits and special agents as merely the business of the public security organs and should recognize that this is the responsibility of every revolutionary comrade. He said: At the same time, we must also avoid becoming panic-stricken with fear and should maintain a calm attitude. He believes that with the efforts of the people's governments at all levels and the support of the broad masses, it will not be difficult to eliminate the few traitors and special agents lurking in the North China region. The study time for these two documents is tentatively set for four days and is expected to end on the 9th. (Lin Hong)

    重视剿匪工作
    华北政府各直属单位深入学习新华社短评
    【本报讯】华北人民政府各部门及各直属单位现正积极学习新华社“消灭麻痹倾向扑灭特务匪徒”和“保护人民祖国的财产”两短评，这次学习从八月五日开始，是继续学习“论人民民主专政”之后开始的。政府学委会于日前向各分学委会发出的通知中，要求各部门不只要组织深入讨论，并要订出执行这两项任务的具体办法。五日午后六时半，华北人民政府公安部杨奇清部长特向全府一千二百余干部，讲解学习这两个文件的重要性。杨部长向大家指出：眼前华北的公开敌人虽已消灭，但隐藏的敌人还是存在的，因此我们不应有丝毫的麻痹大意，直至阶级消灭以前，都应该保持这种警惕性，否则便会招致不应有的损失。杨部长说明了各地残余特务匪徒活动的情形。并称：我们在肃特方面已得到很大的效果，但为了彻底扑灭特务，今后还必须加强这一工作。他希望大家克服过去把肃清匪特仅仅看作是治安机关的事情的错误看法，应认识到这是每一个革命同志的责任。他说：我们同时也要切忌发生惊惶失措的恐惧心理，而应保持冷静态度。相信在各级人民政府的努力和广大群众的支持下，潜伏在华北区的少数奸特分子不难肃清。这两个文件的学习时间暂定四天，预计九日结束。  （林洪）
