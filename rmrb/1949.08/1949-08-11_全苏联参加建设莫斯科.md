    The Entire Soviet Union Participates in the Construction of Moscow
    By Che Chulin, Chief Architect of Moscow

    The completion of the Stalin plan for the reconstruction of Moscow is a great school for Soviet architects, builders, and staff in all sectors of urban construction science and technology.

    The reconstruction of Moscow, the new and outstanding architectural styles of the Moscow Metro, the Moscow Canal, the Agricultural Exhibition, and the central boulevards are unprecedented examples. They demonstrate how to build for the people and how to care for the needs of ordinary people. For the first time in human history, efforts for public welfare and the Stalinist principle of caring for people have guided urban construction workers and inspired architects and artists.

    We know that in cities of capitalist countries such as New York, Paris, and London, behind the splendidly decorated houses in wealthy residential areas, there hide abysses of poverty and oppression. The characteristics and changes in the reconstruction of Moscow not only illustrate the achievements of its architectural art but also bring great benefits to all the people of the capital, including hundreds of thousands of kilowatts of electricity, nearly a 100% increase in residents’ water consumption, and hundreds of thousands of square meters of new and comfortable housing. Moscow's residential areas are rapidly being gasified, and trees are constantly being planted to beautify the city.

    Moscow is currently nearing the completion of the fundamental tasks of its ten-year general plan. Large-scale construction of the fourth phase of the subway is underway. This year, the beautification of the city and the greening of important roads, embankments, and squares in the Soviet capital must be completed according to the reconstruction plan. The Yauza River (a tributary of the Moscow River - translator's note) will also be lined with wide and straight granite embankments, just like the Moscow River.

    A large-scale stadium is being prepared close to the residential building area. This is not only because of the magnificent residential buildings on the roads and riverbanks but also for the sake of many residential buildings.

    Therefore, Moscow will receive more new and very comfortable residential areas in recent years, and it will acquire those complete architectural style characteristics in the construction of central boulevards, large squares, and riverbanks, which will enter the communist era.

    The Party and the great Stalin constantly teach us to devote our full efforts to the scientific work of urban construction in the Soviet Union with the spirit of socialist humanism and to maintain a lively and close connection with the practical science of architects' construction, so as to make the large-scale construction of Moscow prosper on a true foundation.

    Today, on the eve of a new upsurge in the scientific work of urban construction and among architects in the Soviet Union, the Soviet capital is developing to a new stage. The Soviet State Council and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) passed a February decision on formulating a new general plan for the reconstruction of Moscow for a period of twenty to twenty-five years.

    The reality of these urban construction plans lies in the fact that they are part of the entire national economic plan and are based on the possible foundations of socialist economic and technological conditions. Obviously, it is impossible to separate the Moscow reconstruction plan from the growth of the entire Soviet economy and culture. Without the slightest lie, we can say that today's Moscow belongs to the whole country. And there is no Soviet republic that does not participate in this national construction.

    The decision to build eight large high-rise buildings in Moscow, initiated by Comrade Stalin and adopted by the Party and the government, is a model of planned genius foresight. The drafts of the skyscraper buildings won the Stalin Prize this year. These unique skyscraper buildings not only foresee the future communist capital of Moscow but are also the most outstanding monuments of the Stalin era, marking the greatest transformation of this era. All these buildings – when their architectural styles are planned, composed, and designed – will clearly demonstrate the great upsurge of Soviet culture, the endless growth of the material enjoyment of citizens of socialist countries, the prosperity and development of Soviet artistic undertakings, and the upsurge of the spirit of artistic optimism and firm life perseverance.

    The construction of high-rise buildings is the most valuable contribution to the future architectural style of Moscow. In the near future, their architectural and engineering treatises have already shown a very great and positive influence on the practical application of various buildings in the entire Soviet Union and Moscow. The architectural styles of these high-rise buildings are a new vocabulary in architectural knowledge, a common, serious, and magnificent image in architectural knowledge. This knowledge is of course an obligation for all architects, who are honored to be able to create and build the Soviet capital, founded by the world's genius revolutionary Lenin and the beloved leader of progressive humanity throughout the world, Comrade Stalin.

    According to Comrade Stalin's initiative, the task of building such high-rise buildings was put forward to the whole country and to all ethnic groups in the country. All Soviet republics should contribute the most durable and most valuable materials to this construction project. A large number of new building materials, machinery, machines, and various items for interior decoration must be mastered quickly.

    The architects and engineers who won the Stalin Prize for designing the drafts of multi-story building construction successfully handled their most complex creative tasks in the first stage, creating drawings of the magnificent construction project in accordance with certain proportions and silhouettes. In order to realize the noble and principled new ideals contained in the draft approved by the government, a lot of encouragement and tenacious labor are required.

    The high-rise buildings in the Soviet Union are completely different from the skyscrapers in foreign countries. American skyscrapers are an unnatural ugliness on the exterior of capitalist big cities, a grotesque reflection of the desperate contradictions in capitalist countries, and a naked symbol of selfish and barbaric individualism. This kind of skyscraper has nothing in common with the Moscow multi-story building construction, because the Moscow multi-story building construction is the most sublime reflection of the planning nature of Soviet urban construction and the free and intelligent development of the Soviet people.

    Now, Moscow is being built with the strength of the whole country. The people of all the Soviet member republics are paying special attention to the major construction work of the only capital of the socialist motherland. It was so when building the subway, and of course, it is the same today when engaging in multi-story buildings construction. Participating in this construction project is the noble and glorious cause of patriotism of all the people of the Soviet Union. Every republic in the Soviet Union must contribute its natural resources, the excellent achievements of their heroic labor, and their artistic and technical genius. This will be an extraordinary and amazing competition among the republics, border regions, and provinces. Building materials are transported from all over the country, such as hardware from Ukraine, the Urals, and Siberia, timber from the Karelo-Finnish Republic, marble and granite from Ukraine, Georgia, and Crimea, pottery from Latvia and Estonia, and cement from Novorossiysk and Volsk.

    The architectural style of Moscow's high-rise buildings is known for its great solemnity and harmony. They lay the immortal glory and great cause of the Stalin era and raise the lovely and sublime symbol of the Soviet state high in front of the people.

    全苏联参加建设莫斯科
    莫斯科城市总建筑师  车褚林
    完成莫斯科重建的斯大林计划，对苏维埃建筑家们、对城市建设科学和技术一切部门的建设者及工作人员来说，都是伟大的学校。
    莫斯科的重建，莫斯科地下铁道、莫斯科运河、农业展览会、中央大马路等崭新的出色的建筑式样，这是一种空前未有的先例。这都表明要如何为人民而建筑，要如何关心普通人的需要。是在人类历史中第一次对于公共福利事业的努力，斯大林式的关心人们的原则，领导了城市建设者，鼓舞了建筑家们及艺术家们。
    我们知道，在纽约、巴黎、伦敦以及其他资本主义国家城市里，在那些阔人住宅区装饰得富丽堂皇的房子后面，隐藏着多么贫困及多么受压榨的万丈深渊。而莫斯科重建的特点与改变，不仅是说明了他本身建筑艺术的成就，而且也为首都全体人民带来极大的好处，其中包含几十万基罗瓦特的电力，在居民用水的消费方面，几乎增加百分之百，其中还包含几十万平方公尺新而舒适的住宅。莫斯科住宅飞速的瓦斯化起来了，并经常栽种树木，美化市容。
    莫斯科目前将接近完成其十年总计划的根本任务。大规模进行地下铁道第四期的建设。本年内，在苏联首都关于美化市容及重要的马路、河堤、广场的绿化运动方面，一定要照改建计划完成起来。雅乌兹河（莫斯科河支流——译者注）也要和莫斯科河一样用花岗石修成宽而且直的岸堤。
    紧靠着住宅建筑区准备建立一个大规模的运动场。这不仅是因为在马路及河岸上的壮丽宏巍的住宅建筑，而且也为了许多住宅建筑的缘故。
    因此，莫斯科在最近几年内，将得到更多新式的非常舒适的住宅区，而且要在中央大马路、大广场及河岸建筑方面获得那些完整的建筑式样上的特点，它们将进入共产主义时代。
    党和伟大斯大林不断教导我们以社会主义的人道主义精神，致其全力于苏联城市建筑科学工作，并要跟建筑家的建筑的实践科学取得生动的密切联系，从而使大规模的莫斯科建设，在真实的基础上繁荣起来。
    今天正在苏联城市建筑科学工作与建筑家们新高涨的前夜，苏联首都发展到一个新的阶段，苏联国务院及联共（布）党中央委员会通过了关于制定为期二十年至二十五年，改建莫斯科的新的总计划的二月决定。
    这些城市建筑计划的现实性乃在于他们是整个国民经济计划组成中的一部分，乃是基于社会主义经济与技术条件的可能的基础之上的。显而易见，将莫斯科重建计划与苏联整个经济及文化的增长相隔离开来的看法是不可能的。我们没有半点撒谎，我们可以说，今天的莫斯科是全国的。而且没有那一个苏维埃共和国不参加这个全民性的建筑。
    由斯大林同志的发起，而被党和政府通过的莫斯科八大高楼大厦建筑之决定，乃是有计划的天才预见的模范。大厦建筑的草案于今年获得斯大林奖金。这些独一无二的大厦建筑，不仅可预见未来共产主义社会的首都莫斯科，而且也是斯大林时代最出色的纪念物，标帜着这个时代的最伟大的改造。所有这些建筑——当经过他们胸中计划、构图、设计出建筑式样来的时候，就将明确的证明着，苏联文化的巨大高涨，社会主义国家公民的物质享受无止境的增长，苏联艺术事业的繁荣与发展，以及艺术乐观主义的精神和坚定的生命毅力的高涨。
    高楼大厦建筑，这在莫斯科未来建筑艺术式样上，具有最宝贵的贡献。在最近期内，他们在建筑艺术上及工程上的论著，早就对全苏联及莫斯科的多种建筑的实际应用上，显示了十分伟大的良好影响。这些高楼大厦的建筑式样，就是建筑学识上的一种新语汇，就是建筑学识上的一种平凡的、严肃的、壮丽雄巍的形象。这种学识，对所有的建筑学家来说，当然是一种应尽的义务，他们很荣幸，能以创造和建设这世界天才的革命家列宁曾经居住过的，全世界进步人类敬爱的领袖斯大林同志创建的苏联首都。
    根据斯大林同志的发起，对全国及全国各族人民提出了这种高楼大厦建筑的任务。苏维埃各共和国都应当为这种建筑工程贡献出最耐久的、最贵重的一切物资。必须迅速的掌握大量的，内部装饰的新式建筑物资、机械、机器及各种物品。
    因设计出多层大厦建筑草案而获得斯大林奖金的建筑家们及工程师们，在第一阶段内就极为顺利的处理了自己最复杂的创造任务，按照一定的比例及剪影，创造了建筑浩大工程的图样。为以实现在政府批准的草案中所包含的高尚的及有原则的新理想，就要求很多的鼓舞和顽强地劳动。
    苏联的高楼大厦建筑，丝毫不同于外国的摩天大楼。美国的摩天楼，乃是在资本主义大城市的外表上的一种违反自然的丑态，乃是在资本主义国家绝望的矛盾中的一种奇形怪状的反映，乃是自私野蛮的个人主义的赤裸裸的象征。这种摩天楼，跟莫斯科的多层大厦建筑，毫无相同之处，因为莫斯科多层大厦建筑，乃是苏联城市建筑计划性及苏联人民自由与智慧发展底最崇高的一种反映。
    现在，正以全国的力量来建设莫斯科。苏联各盟员共和国的全体人民的视线特别注视着社会主义祖国自己唯一的首都的重大建设工作。建设地下铁道的时候，曾经是如此，当然，今天从事多层的大ｓōｕ＠①建筑同样是如此。参加这一建筑工程，乃是苏联全体人民爱国主义高贵的及光荣的事业。苏联的每个共和国要拿本国的天然富源，贡献出他们英雄劳动的优良成绩，献出自己艺术的及技术的天才。这将是各共和国、边区及省的非凡惊人的竞赛。建筑材料从各地运来，例如乌克兰、乌拉尔及西比利亚的五金，卡列里·芬兰共和国的木材，乌克兰、格鲁吉亚及克里米亚的大理石及花岗石，拉脱维亚及爱沙尼亚的陶器，诺沃罗西斯克及伏尔斯克的洋灰。
    莫斯科高楼大厦建筑式样是以伟大庄严而又协和一致闻名的。他们奠定了斯大林时代永垂不朽的光荣及伟大的事业，在人民面前，高高举起那苏维埃国家的可爱的及崇高的象征。
