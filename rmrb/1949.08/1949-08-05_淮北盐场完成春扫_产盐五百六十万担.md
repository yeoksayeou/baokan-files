    Huaibei Salt Field Completes Spring Salt Production
    Producing 5.6 Million Dan of Salt
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The spring salt production at the Huaibei Salt Field in Jiangsu Province has concluded. In ninety days, a total of 5.65 million dan of salt (110 jin per dan) was produced, completing 88% of the spring production task of 7 million dan and restoring 70% of the pre-war average output (3,000 dan per salt pan). The electrified Dapu Salt Field produced 78,000 dan of salt, exceeding the total annual output of 46,000 dan in 1946 under Kuomintang rule by 67%. Note: After the complete liberation of the Huaibei Salt Field in November of last year, the People's Government actively led salt workers to repair salt pans, purchase tools, provide grain loans, and prepare for the resumption of production. The spring production began in mid-March this year. In May and June, there was continuous rain, which greatly affected production due to the inundation of the salt pans. However, thanks to the active leadership of the People's Government, the salt workers demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm, fighting against the rain by going to work early and staying late, taking advantage of the tides, and diverting water. Women and children also went to the salt pans to work, and ultimately, the majority of the planned task was completed.

    淮北盐场完成春扫
    产盐五百六十万担
    【本报讯】江苏省淮北盐场春扫已结束，九十天共产盐五百六十五万担（每担一百一十市斤），完成春扫任务七百万担的百分之八十八，恢复抗战前平均产量（每份滩三千担）的百分之七十。电气化的大浦盐田共产盐七万八千担，超过国民党统治时—民国三十五年的全年产量四万六千余担的百分之六十七。按：淮北盐场自去年十一月全部解放后，人民政府即积极领导盐工修理滩地，购办工具，贷放粮食，进行恢复生产的准备工作。今年三月中旬开始春扫，五六月间经常霪雨连绵，滩地被浸，影响生产至巨；但由于人民政府积极领导，盐工均发挥高度劳动热忱，与阴雨作斗争，起早搭晚拿潮拐水，妇女儿童都上滩生产，终能大部完成预订任务。
