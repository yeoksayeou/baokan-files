Ten Thousand Rivers and Thousand Mountains are Nothing!
    A Record of the Liberation Army Unit Crossing Jing Mountain in a Rainstorm
    Huang Mei
    "You're working hard fighting in the heat of summer," many residents said during the Liberation Army's southern advance. The soldiers, marching in extreme heat, mountainous terrain, and heavy rain, excellently demonstrated the People's Liberation Army's fine tradition of hard struggle.
    It was the hottest time of the year in the South. The soldiers, carrying dozens of pounds of weapons and grain, were drenched in sweat, as if they had walked out of the water. The villages in western Hubei are small, and the people are scattered. The troops often camped by the roadside, soaked by fine rain-like dew and bitten by swarms of mosquitoes through their clothes. As a result, the soldiers were extremely tired and slept so soundly that even cars passing by, honking horns, and shouting people and neighing horses could not wake them.
    When the reporter passed Shili Pu on the Han-Yi Highway, it was pouring rain at night, the sky was pitch black, and a flash of lightning revealed the troops advancing in ankle-deep mud. People and horses were beaten by the heavy rain and could not open their eyes, their bodies shining with a dim rain light, as if coated with a layer of black oil.
    In the darkness, I only heard the question: "Boss, is the road to the west?" followed by a burst of mud splashing, and they continued to move forward. In the heavy rain, residents shouted: "You can't go in this heavy rain!" But the soldiers replied: "Don't worry, boss."
    I saw those drivers who had not closed their eyes for two days and nights, still straining to keep their eyes wide open, wearing only a pair of underpants, stripped of their clothes, laboriously driving their cars, rushing into the Jing Mountain area in the dark and mud. Lightly ill soldiers supported themselves with sticks, and young propagandists carried musical instruments... No matter who it was, they all had only one belief: "Advance rapidly and annihilate the enemy."
    Particularly arduous was the task of the troops who crossed the Jing Mountain range, inserted themselves through small paths to the enemy's heartland to fight. These warriors, who had fought in the minus forty degrees Celsius cold of the Northeast, were now advancing in the extremely hot mountains above thirty degrees Celsius. The climate was volatile, suddenly an unshielded and concealed scorching sun, and suddenly a torrential rain that stung the face. The mountain roads, eroded by mountain floods and in disrepair for years, were almost impossible to find. The small paths meandered through high mountains, cliffs, and winding rivers. When passing the Shiyu Peak, which is more than 1,500 meters high and slopes at more than fifty degrees, the advance troops moved forward for a day, and the rear guard troops had not yet reached the mountain by the morning of the next day. One day it rained, and a certain regiment only traveled fifteen li in one day, and another regiment traveled only eight li in one night. Seventy percent of the livestock had worn out their backs and stumbled, requiring shoeing twice a day. The soldiers' shoes were all worn out, and the rear could not supply them in time, so they advanced barefoot. The artillerymen disassembled the cannons and carried them up the mountain. Division Commander He of a certain division also personally carried a heavy machine gun to climb the mountain.
    The troops passed through Huima Pit. Local people say that during the Three Kingdoms period, Guan Yu attempted to pass through here after his defeat at Maicheng, but was captured because the road was difficult. This is a thirty-five-li-long mountain gully, with a river running through it, forming forty-eight bends, with cliffs on both sides, rising a thousand feet. The troops crossed these forty-eight river bends day and night, advancing along the gully. When a rain came, the river water rose to chest level, and the soldiers who could swim swam across the river, and then used leggings to pull people across one by one. When there was no road ahead, the vanguard troops climbed up the cliffs and used leggings to hoist the soldiers up. In this way, our advance troops, with a forced march of thirty hours without rest and without eating for a day, passed through one hundred and eighty li of mountain terrain, arrived at the assault location on time, and immediately plunged into fierce battle. The enemy, caught by surprise, retreated in defeat, and a prisoner asked in a panic: "How did you get here?"

    万水千山只等闲！
    记解放军某部在暴风雨中翻越荆山的进军

    “六腊不打仗，你们辛苦了。”在解放军这次南进途中许多居民都这样说。战士们在酷热、山地、急雨中行军，卓越地表现了人民解放军艰苦奋斗的优良传统。
    正是南方的头伏时节，战士们背着几十斤重的武器和粮食，满身大汗，湿得好象从水里走了出来。鄂西一带村小，人家分散，部队常常露宿在大路边，被细雨一样的露水淋打着，被成群的蚊子隔着衣服咬着。于是战士们太疲乏了，睡得熟极了，连汽车在身边过，喇叭叫，人喊马嘶，都不能惊醒他们。
    记者途经汉宜公路十里铺时，夜间大雨倾盆，漫天漆黑，一阵闪电才照见了队伍在深至脚踝的泥泞中前进。人和马匹被急雨打得睁不开眼睛，身上闪着幽暗的雨光，好像涂了一层黑油。
    黑暗中只听到问：“老板，往西是不是路？”接着就是一阵泥溅声，继续前进了。急雨中有居民喊：“这大雨不能走了！”但战士们却回答：“不怕，老板。”
    我看到那些已经两天一夜没有闭过眼睛的司机同志们，还拼睁得大大的眼睛，只穿着一条裤衩，脱光了衣服，费力地驾驶着汽车，在黑夜泥泞中冲向荆山山地。轻病号扶着棍子，年青的宣传员们背着乐器……无论是谁都只有一个信念：“迅速前进，追歼敌人。”
    特别艰苦的是跨越荆山山脉，从小路穿插到敌人心脏去作战的部队。这些曾在东北零下四十度的严寒中作过战的勇士们，现在是在摄氏三十度以上的奇热的山岭中进军。气候变化无常，忽然是毫无遮拦隐蔽的炽热的太阳，忽然又是打得脸上发痛的暴风骤雨，山路因为山洪冲刷，年久失修，几乎找不到路的痕迹。小路蜿蜒在高山峻岭、悬崖峭壁和弯曲的小河之中。路过一千五百余公尺高、五十余度倾斜的石峪高峰时，前面部队前进了一天，后卫部队到第二天上午还有没有上山。有一天下雨了，某团一天只走了十五里地，另一个团走了一夜才走八里。牲口百分之七十都磨坏了背，走蹶了腿，一天要钉两次掌。战士们的鞋都走破了，后方一时接济不上，就赤着脚前进。炮兵们把炮拆卸，扛着上山。某师贺师长也亲自扛着一挺重机枪爬山。
    队伍经过回马坑，当地人民传说这里是三国时关羽败退麦城后，曾企图由此通过，由于道路难走，回马被俘。这是一条三十五里长的山沟，一道河流贯穿其间，形成了四十八个弯曲，峭壁夹道，一拔千尺。部队日夜渡过这四十八个河曲，顺沟前进。一阵雨来，河水即涨至胸前，战士会浮水的游过河去，然后用裹腿把人一个一个拉过去。前面没有路了，前卫的部队就爬上峭崖，用裹腿把战士吊上去。就是这样，我先头部队以三十小时不休息的强行军，一天没有吃饭，通过了一百八十里的山地，按时到达了奔袭地点，立即猛烈投入战斗。受到突然袭击的敌人败退了，一个俘虏惊慌失措地问道：“你们怎样来的？”
