    Italy's Land Reform Struggle
    By Geliniu, translated by Wang Yu

    Today, in the Italian countryside, various laboring peasants and agricultural workers are fighting for urgent demands such as opposing layoffs and striving for higher wages and more reasonable contracts. Due to its broad scope and the increasingly sharp domestic political situation, this peasant struggle has become an important component of the overall struggle launched by Italy's progressive forces for land reform.

    This struggle is mainly because landlords who own large estates and farm owners who engage in large-scale capitalist operations occupy more than half of the country's land, while the state, the church, local governments, and other bourgeois owners control a quarter of all land. Thus, only a quarter of arable land is left for the peasants.

    Out of the eight million peasants in the country, only two million are self-cultivating farmers. The other six million are landless or land-poor peasants who work for the big landlords and are oppressed and exploited by them.

    The production relations between the landlords and the rural working people are complex and vary greatly from region to region. However, exploitation and oppression are the same everywhere. Landlords have the right to arbitrarily dismiss the peasants they employ, which forces peasants to accept any conditions in order to survive, and all production relations are based on this.

    Peasants with a small amount of land (mostly poor peasants) are also oppressed, especially economically, and have to pay heavy taxes.

    This is the situation in all provinces where peasants are fighting for urgent demands. Their struggle is developing into an overall struggle for land reform, for the reform of social relations in the countryside, that is, for the redistribution of large estates, the abolition of landlord autocracy, and better living conditions.

    The struggle for land reform has been strengthened and promoted by the day-to-day actions of the peasants, which reflect the struggle for land reform. Each action has different reasons. However, facing the stubborn resistance of landlords and farm owners backed by the Christian Democratic government (whose representative in the government is Minister of Justice Grassi, one of the largest landowners in the Apulia region), these actions are in fact countless episodes in the overall struggle for the reform of the social structure and the democratic renovation of the country.

    Peasants in the rural areas on the outskirts of Rome, in southern Italy, and on various islands are fighting for land reform. When Communist Party member Gullo was Minister of Agriculture, peasants in these areas obtained nearly 200,000 hectares of uncultivated or semi-cultivated land. Today, these peasants are fighting against the attempts by those former lords to take back the land with the help of the reactionary De Gasperi government. Peasants who have formed cooperatives not only refuse to give up their land, but are also launching a movement to acquire more land. In southern Italy, there are more than two million hectares of uncultivated or semi-cultivated land, and more than one million landless peasants.

    In northern Italy, where capitalist agricultural management prevails, the struggle for land reform is aimed at large farm owners.

    In many farms, agricultural workers and technical experts have united to establish farm committees, forcing capitalist landlords to respect the right of all laboring peasants to participate in the leadership and management of the economy as stipulated in the constitution. This struggle is similar to the struggle to establish factory committees in industry.

    The movement against arbitrary breaches of contract is one of the focal points of the struggle to revise the system of labor relations. This struggle is broad in scope and includes all laboring peasants: hired agricultural workers, smallholders, sharecroppers, etc. Its impact extends to all peasants living under landlord oppression.

    The peasants have succeeded in forcing the government and landlords to extend the contracts signed during the war. The second step is to ensure that peasants with land do not lose their land except for legitimate reasons put forward by special joint committees, in order to win the right for peasants to cultivate their own land forever and to abolish landlord arbitrariness.

    Agricultural workers who cannot find stable jobs are fighting for a democratic system of wage labor. This is a difficult struggle, which has led to sharp conflicts in Emilia and Apulia. Agricultural workers rightly regard this struggle as their main struggle, because only a democratic employment system can prevent the disruption of strikes and protect wages and other conditions listed in their agreements, such as working hours, etc.

    One of the results of their years of struggle is that sharecroppers have freed themselves from feudal remnants such as gifts (poultry, ham, etc.) and corvée labor. This achievement must now be included in all contracts.

    Tenant farmers are fighting against land rents that are already high and are constantly rising. In many cases (for example, in the province of Naples), organized resistance has forced the greed of the landlords to be slightly restrained. Currently, tenant farmers are fighting to ensure that the amount of rent is determined on the same basis as the assessor determines various incomes when assessing the rent.

    These are the main goals around which the struggles currently taking place in the Italian countryside revolve. Millions of men and women are participating in this struggle. It is a difficult struggle, often resulting in fierce conflicts, in which the self-sacrifice of the peasants confronts the reactionary spirit of the landlords and farm owners, who are supported by the Christian Democratic government.

    The support of urban workers is one of the main conditions for ensuring the success of the actions of the rural working people. Thus, in the autumn of 1948, when the sharecroppers and tenant farmers in Tuscany, Emilia, and Lombardy were fighting, the workers in factories and offices in the city supported them with solidarity strikes. On the rural working people's side, they helped the striking factory workers with food and took care of their children. The fighting alliance between the workers in northern Italy and the peasants in southern and central Italy is growing stronger in their joint struggle.

    Accompanying the tenacious struggle in the countryside is the equally tenacious and persistent struggle of the Communist Party in parliament, demanding that the rights guaranteed by the constitution not remain on paper.

    The Communist Party has taken a resolute stand on this issue. As soon as parliament convened, Communist Party members proposed a detailed land reform bill based on principles that conform to the interests of the peasants.

    The Communist Party's land law stipulates that the maximum area of ​​a farm is one hundred hectares. In addition, it lists the necessary reforms in the countryside as follows:

    Tenant farmers have the right to cultivate their land forever; arbitrary breach of contract is prohibited; the distribution of crop yields between landlords and tenant farmers should be proportional to the labor contributed by both parties; laboring peasants should participate in village management, recognizing farm committees; restricting and regulating land rents; prohibiting subletting; providing small and medium farmers with technical and financial assistance.

    This initiative taken by the Communist Party forced the government, which had been unwilling to think about land reform since the 1948 general election, to propose its own bill. As we can imagine, this bill completely fails to meet the demands of the peasants and contradicts the promises made by the Christian Democratic Party on the eve of the general election. The Communist Party was therefore able to expose the government's true intentions on this issue, thereby further isolating it among the masses.

    Through the National Federation of Agricultural Workers, through the various agricultural cooperatives affiliated to the National League of Cooperatives, and through the various land committees affiliated to the National Congress of Peasants, the Communist Party leads the struggle for land reform.

    Before electing representatives to participate in the National Land Committee Congress, dozens of meetings were held, in which millions of laboring peasants and people from other strata discussed land reform and the struggle to implement land reform. More than two million people participated in the election of representatives to attend the National Land Committee Congress held in Modena on March 13th and 14th. These two million laboring people not only elected their representatives, but also put forward their demands. In this way, in a nationwide campaign lasting more than three months, the broad masses of laboring people learned about the demands of land reform.

    These millions of people who declared their determination to fight for land also made it clear their loyalty to the cause of freedom and peace. The first task of the National Congress of Land Committees was to pass a resolution to fight for peace amid a storm of applause, expressing the will of all Italian peasants. The support of millions of Italian peasants for the Paris Congress in Defense of Peace is expressed by the slogan: "We want land, not war!" It has become a major slogan.

### 意大利的土地改革斗争

    意大利的土地改革斗争
    格利牛著·王禺译
    今天在意大利农村中，各种劳动农民和农业工人都正在为反对解雇、争取较多的工资与较合理的合同等迫切要求而斗争着。由于它范围的广泛和国内政治形势的日益尖锐化，这一农民的斗争已成为意大利进步力量为土地改革而发动的总的斗争中一个重要组成部分。
    这一斗争主要是因为，拥有大庄园的地主和进行大规模资本主义经营的农场主，占有全国土地的半数以上，而国家、教堂、地方政府及其他资产阶级所有主们，控制了全部土地的四分之一。这样，可耕地就只有四分之一剩给农民了。
    在全国八百万农民中，只有二百万是自耕农。其他的六百万是无地或少地的农民，他们替大地主工作，受大地主的压迫和剥削。
    地主与农村劳动人民之间的生产关系是复杂的，而且因地区不同而有很大的差别。但是剥削和压迫则到处是一样的。地主有权利任意解雇他所雇用的农民，这样就迫使农民为了自己的生活而接受任何条件，一切生产关系都是根据这个的。
    有着少量土地的农民（大部分为贫农）也是受压迫的，特别在经济方面，不得不缴纳很重的税。
    这就是所有各省中农民正为着迫切要求而战斗着的形势。他们的斗争正发展成一个总的斗争，这个总的斗争是为争取土地改革，为争取农村中社会关系的改革，也就是说，争取大庄园的重新分配、地主专制的废除及较好的生活条件。
    土地改革的斗争因为农民日复一日的行动而加强了、促进了，这些行动反映了土地改革的斗争。每一次行动都有不同的原因。但是，面临着以基督教民主党政府作靠山的地主和农场主们（农场主在政府中的代表就是司法部长格拉西，阿普利亚区最大地主之一）的顽抗，这些行动事实上就是争取社会结构的改革和国家民主革新的总的斗争中的无数插曲。
    罗马市郊农村中的农民，意大利南部以及各个岛上的农民都正在为土地改革而战斗着。当共产党员盖洛任农业部长的时候，这些地区的农民获得了将近二十万海克脱的未开垦或半开垦的土地。今天这些农民正在为反对那些昔日的领主在反动的加斯贝利政府帮助下夺回土地的企图而战斗。成立了合作社的农民们，不仅拒绝放弃他们的土地，而且正在发起争取更多土地的运动。在意大利南部，有二百万海克脱以上的未开垦或半开垦的土地，有一百万以上的无地农民。
    在资本主义农业经营占优势的意大利北部，土地改革的斗争是针对着大农场主的。
    在很多农场里，农业工人和技术专家们联合起来设立了农场委员会，迫使资本主义的地主们尊重宪法上规定的一切劳动农民应参加经济的领导和管理的权利。这个斗争和争取在工业中成立工厂委员会的斗争相类似。
    反对任意破坏合同的运动，是修改劳动关系制度的斗争的焦点之一。这个斗争范围很广，包括了所有的劳动农民：受雇的农业工人、少地户、伙种户等都同样地有份。它的影响，及于生活在地主压迫下的一切农民。
    农民们在迫使政府和地主延长在战时签订的合同一事上获得了成功。第二步是要确实使有地的农民，除了由特别的联合委员会提出的正当理由外，不致丧失其土地，以赢得农民能永远耕种自己土地的权利，并废除地主的专断。
    不能找到稳定工作的农业工人们，正在为争取一种雇佣劳动的民主制度而斗争。这是一个艰难的斗争，它在爱米利亚和阿普利亚两地，已经导向了尖锐的冲突。农业工人们正确地把这一斗争当作他们的主要斗争，因为只有一种民主的雇佣制度才能防止罢工的被破坏，才能保护工资及在他们协议中所列举了的其他条件，诸如工作日等等。
    他们多年来斗争所得结果之一，就是伙种户摆脱了象以礼物（家禽、火腿等）劳役等等的封建残余。这种收获现在必须包括在所有的合同里。
    佃农们正在为反对已经够高而且正在不断上升着的地租而斗争。在很多情形下（比方在拿不勒斯省），有组织的抵抗已经迫使地主们的贪欲稍稍收敛了一些。目前佃户们正在进行斗争，要使地租数额之确定，与评定租额者确定各种收入，根据同一的基础。
    这些就是今天意大利农村中正在进行的斗争所围绕着的几个主要目标。数百万男女正在参加这个斗争。它是一场艰苦的斗争，结果往往是激烈的冲突，在这种斗争里，农民的自我牺牲对抗着地主和农场主们的反动精神，后面两种人是受到基督教民主党政府的支持的。
    城市工人的支援是保证农村劳动人民的行动获得成功的主要条件之一。就这样，在一九四八年秋天，脱斯加尼、爱米利亚及龙巴底等地区的伙种户和佃农们进行斗争的时候，城里的工厂和机关的工人曾用团结的罢工来予以支持。在农村劳动人民这方面，则以食物帮助罢工的工厂工人，并替他们照管孩子。意大利北部的工人和意大利南部及中部的农民，他们的战斗同盟在他们的联合斗争中正日益强大起来。
    伴随着农村中顽强斗争的是共产党在议会中同样顽强和坚持的斗争，他们要求不要让宪法所保障的权利停留在纸上。
    共产党在这个问题上采取了果断的立场。议会一开会，共产党议员就提出了一部详尽的基于符合农民利益的原则的土地改革法案。
    共产党的土地法规定农场的最大面积是一百海克脱。另外它将农村中应有的改革列举如下：
    佃农有权永远耕种自己的一份地；禁止任意破坏合同；地主与佃农之间庄稼收成的分配，应与双方所付劳动成比例；劳动农民应参加乡村管理，承认农场委员会；限制并管制地租；禁止转租；以技术及财政上的帮助给予小农及中农。
    共产党率先采取的这一行动，迫使在一九四八年大选以后就不愿想到土地改革的政府，提出了它自己的法案。正如我们所想象得到的，这个法案完全不符合农民的要求，而且与基督教民主党在大选前夕所作诺言相矛盾。共产党因此能够揭露了政府在这个问题上的真意向，从而使它在群众中更加孤立。
    通过全国农业工人联合会，通过附属于全国合作社联盟的各个农业合作社以及附属于全国农民代表大会的各个土地委员会，共产党领导着土地改革的斗争。
    在选出代表参加全国土地委员会代表大会以前，举行了好几十次的集会，数百万的劳动农民和其他各阶层人士在这些集会上，讨论了土地改革和实行土地改革的斗争，二百万以上的人民参加了三月十三日、十四日两天在莫丹娜城举行的出席全国土地委员会代表大会的代表选举。这两百万劳动人民不仅选举了他们的代表，而且提出了他们的要求。这样，在持续达三月以上的全国性竞选运动中，广大的劳动人民群众都闻悉了土地改革的要求。
    这些数以百万计的声言他们决心为土地而战的人们，同时也明确表示了他们对自由与和平事业的忠心。土地委员会全国代表大会的第一件工作就是在暴风雨般的掌声中通过一项为和平而战的决议，表达了全意大利农民的意志。数百万意大利农民对巴黎拥护和平大会的支持由下面这条口号表达出来：“要土地，不要战争”！它已经成为一个主要的口号。
