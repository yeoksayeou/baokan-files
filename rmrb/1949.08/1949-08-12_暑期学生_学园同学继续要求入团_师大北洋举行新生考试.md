    Summer Students
    School Comrades Continue to Request Joining the League
    Normal University and Beiyang University Hold New Student Exams
    ▲In the Northwest District of the Youth Academy, the Youth League branches of various schools have launched a big-character poster campaign in the past few days, completing three days of work in two days. They systematically introduced the nature and work of the League, the content of organizational life, and learning perspectives and methods, covering the walls of the campus. At the same time, the blackboard newspapers are also reporting on the League's activities in various schools every day.
    ▲At 3:00 PM on the 9th, Comrade Zhang Dazhong gave a lecture on "Introducing the Youth League" in the auditorium of Fu Jen Catholic University. His lecture was in the form of answering questions, so students constantly sent up small slips of paper to the stage, raising their various questions and doubts one by one.
    ▲In order to increase students' interest in science and radio research, the Northwest District Remedial Class for Culture and Education specially invited Professor Hu Yun of Peking University to lecture on "Common Knowledge of Radio," with experiments as well. During the experiments, electrical energy was transformed into sound, and then sound was transformed into electrical energy, which the students were very interested in. (Northwest District Youth Academy)
    ▲After listening to the introduction of the Youth League on Tuesday, the students in the Northeast District of the Academy were given a copy of the League Constitution for every two people, and on Wednesday they began discussions and study. After the discussion, many students raised requests to join the League, which fully demonstrated that the students had a correct understanding of the League. Later, there will be important reports on the Sino-Soviet problem and learning issues. (Northeast District Summer Academy)
    ▲Normal University and Beiyang University held new student entrance exams in the Pingjin, Shenyang, Shanghai, and Wuhan areas on the 8th and 9th. The Peiping test area was further divided into three test areas. The first and second test areas were the test sites for Normal University, and the third test area was the test site for Beiyang University. The two universities' candidate service centers solved many difficulties for the candidates during registration and collected applications for financial aid. During the exam period, many departments such as inquiry, sales, borrowing, storage, and problem-solving were set up to serve the students. (Beiyang Candidate Service Center)

    ▲九日下午三时在辅大礼堂由张大中同志讲：“介绍青年团”，他的讲演是一个解答性质的，所以同学不断向台上传小条，把他们的各种问题疑问一一提出。
    ▲西北区文补班，为了提高同学对科学，对无线电研究之兴趣，特请北大胡筠教授讲“无线电常识”更有实验配合，当时所实验，把电能变成声音，再把声音转变为电能，同学们非常感兴趣。（西北区青年学园）
    ▲学园东北区同学于星期二听了青年团介绍后，每两个人发了一份团章，星期三便展开了讨论学习，讨论完以后，许多同学提出了入团的要求，这充分的表示出同学们对团有了正确的认识。以后还有中苏问题及学习问题等重要的报告。（暑期学园东北区）
