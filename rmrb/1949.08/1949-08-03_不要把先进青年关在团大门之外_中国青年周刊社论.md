Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 3rd. The central organ of the China New Democratic Youth League, "China Youth" weekly, published an editorial in its thirteenth issue today, titled "Don't Shut Advanced Youths Out of the Communist Youth League," correcting the deviation in some areas of setting overly harsh entry requirements, not in accordance with the League's charter. The editorial stated:

    Since the First Congress of the Youth League, the League's organizations in various regions have developed further. However, in some places, in some factories and schools, when developing League members, they do not act in accordance with the League's charter, but set harsh conditions and raise the standards very high. In a certain factory, it was stipulated that only those who had earned two minor merits and one major merit could join the League. The procedures for joining the League are also not in accordance with the League's charter, but are extremely complicated. Often, excessive and inappropriate questioning occurs regarding background, history, and some details of life. In Southern Manchuria, one student was repeatedly discussed in large and small meetings simply because he had transferred schools once. One young worker, who was excellent in production, study, and political understanding, was not approved to join the League simply because he had a slightly irritable temperament. Those who were indeed forced to collectively join the Three People's Principles Youth League before liberation, or who only participated in a summer camp organized by the Three People's Principles Youth League once, are also treated as personnel who have broken away from reactionary parties, and they have to go through the procedures for joining the League. In Southern Manchuria, one middle school with more than 900 students only developed one League member in half a year, and one normal school had one hundred and several dozen people apply to join the League, but only five were approved.

    All of the above practices are incorrect. Although they have been corrected in some areas, they are still occurring in others. The reason for this is that the League members in these places (first and foremost, the League cadres) have not yet ideologically recognized that the League is a mass organization of advanced youths, and they do not understand the League's mass character and breadth. Especially in the current situation of the high tide of the Chinese people's great revolution, the youth's awakening is unprecedentedly high. If we shut these youths who meet the requirements for joining the League out of the League's gate, it will inevitably hinder the League's connection with the broad masses of youths, and make the League a narrow small group, repeating the mistakes of the late Communist Youth League.

    However, this does not mean that people can be pulled into the League casually, or that the League's political purity can be disregarded. If we do that, we will make another mistake. We call on League cadres to conscientiously study the CCP Central Committee's resolution on building the League and the documents of the League Congress, and first establish a correct understanding of the League themselves. Then, combined with the actual situation in various regions, openly build the League and develop League members in mass movements and various tasks. Only in this way can we establish a truly advanced and mass-based Youth League.

    不要把先进青年关在团大门之外
    中国青年周刊社论
    【新华社北平三日电】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会机关报“中国青年”周刊在今日出版的第十三期中发表社论，题为“不要把先进青年关在团大门之外”，纠正某些地区不按团章规定，把入团条件定得过苛的偏向。社论称：
    青年团第一次代表大会以后，各地区团的组织都有了进一步的发展。但是在有些地方，有些工厂、学校中，在发展团员时不按照团章办事，而是把条件定得苛刻，标准提得很高。在某工厂里，规定为立过两小功、一大功的才能入团。入团手续，也不按照团章，而是十分繁复。往往对成份、历史和一些生活上的细节，发生过分的不适当的追问。南满有一个学生，只因为转过一次学，就开大会小会反复讨论。有一个青工，生产、学习、政治认识都很好，只因脾气暴躁一点，就没有被批准入团。对于解放前确系被迫集体加入三青团的，或只参加过一次三青团主办的夏令营的，也把他们当作脱离反动党派的人员处理，履行入团手续。南满有一个九百多人的中学，半年中只发展了一个团员，有一个师范学校有一百几十人申请入团，结果只批准了五个人。
    以上种种做法，都是不正确的，虽然在一些地区里已经纠正，但在另一些地方还在发生。它的原因在于这些地方的团员（首先是团的干部）还没有从思想上认识了团是先进青年的群众性的组织，不了解团的群众性与广泛性。特别在目前中国人民大革命高潮的形势下，青年们的觉悟空前提高，如果我们把这些合乎入团条件的青年关在团的大门之外，那一定会妨碍团与广大青年群众的联系，使团成为狭隘的小集团，重复共产主义青年团后期的错误。
    但是，这并不是说可以随便拉人入团，可以不必保持团在政治上的纯洁性。如果那样做，我们就将犯了另一错误。我们号召团的干部，切实地学习中共中央建团决议和团代大会的文件，自己先树立对于团的正确认识，再结合各地的实际情况，在群众运动和各种工作中公开建团和发展团员，只有这样才能建立一个真正的先进的群众性的青年团。
