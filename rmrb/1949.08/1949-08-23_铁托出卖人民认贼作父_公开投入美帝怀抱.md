　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 22nd: The Tito traitorous clique is increasingly and openly throwing itself into the embrace of American imperialism. According to TASS, Washington, the Tito clique, which has been maintaining silence on the Soviet government's reply and attempting to continue deceiving the Yugoslav people, recently held talks with US Secretary of State Acheson through its ambassador to the US, Kosanović. After the meeting, Kosanović told reporters that they discussed "outstanding issues." When asked if he had discussed the Soviet note, Kosanović vaguely evaded the question, saying that his discussion with Acheson was "very general."

　　Following Truman's recent statement that he himself had considered the possibility of supplying Yugoslavia with steel mill equipment, the Associated Press, citing US government officials' announcement on the evening of the 17th, reported that the United States had authorized Yugoslavia to purchase steel mill equipment from American companies. Meanwhile, according to the Polish News Agency, World Bank Chairman Hall, currently in Belgrade, declared that the bank's board of directors would soon review Tito's request for a loan of $280 million; Yugoslavia would receive an appropriate loan. The BBC revealed that the US side would not only study the terms of the Yugoslav loan but also the deposits of strategic materials such as copper, chromium, and antimony in Yugoslavia.

　　At the same time, the Belgian newspaper *La Libre Belgique* revealed with unconcealed satisfaction: "Tito has completely severed its relationship with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, and its relationship with Western countries will continue to expand, especially after concluding trade agreements with Britain, Austria, France, and Italy." (TASS, Brussels, August 18th) The Yugoslav News Agency announced in Belgrade on the 20th that a commercial treaty between Yugoslavia and West Germany had also been signed.

　　铁托出卖人民认贼作父
  　公开投入美帝怀抱
    【新华社北平二十二日电】铁托叛徒集团正日益公开地投入美帝国主义怀抱。据塔斯社华盛顿讯，对苏联政府复文一直保持缄默并企图继续欺瞒南斯拉夫人民的铁托集团，最近通过其驻美大使科萨诺维区与美国务卿艾奇逊会谈。科氏于会后对记者谈话，说他们讨论了“悬案”。当问他是否讨论了苏联照会的事时，科萨诺维区含糊地搪塞说，他与艾奇逊的讨论是“很一般性的”。
    在杜鲁门最近声明他本人曾考虑供给南斯拉夫以炼钢厂设备的可能性之后，据美联社引美政府官员十七日晚公告，美国已准许南斯拉夫向美国公司购买炼钢厂器材。同时据波兰通讯社消息，现在贝尔格莱德的世界银行董事长豪尔宣称，该行董事会最近将审议铁托的二亿八千万美元借款的要求；南斯拉夫将获得一笔适当的贷款。英国广播公司透露，美国方面不仅要研究南斯拉夫借款条件，而且还要研究南国的铜、铬和锑等战略原料的蕴藏。
    与此同时，比利时自由报以毫不隐瞒的满意情绪透露：“铁托完全割断了它与苏联及人民民主国家关系，他与西方国家之间的关系将继续扩大，特别是在与英奥法意等国缔结贸易协定之后。”（塔斯社布鲁塞尔十八日电）南斯拉夫通讯社二十日在贝尔格莱德宣布，南与西德之间的商务条约亦已签订。
