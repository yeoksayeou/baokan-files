[Hubei News] Since the Hubei Branch of the People's Bank of China established seven larger branches in Xiaogan, Huanggang, Mianyang, Daye, Xiangyang, Jiangling, Yichang and other cities, and county banks in more than 60% of the counties, the first task of each bank was to lead the people to reject silver dollars and promote the RMB, in order to stabilize prices and connect urban and rural areas. More than half of Hubei Province is a new area. Because the RMB has not yet fully occupied the market in rural areas,奸商匪特(Reactionary Merchants and Bandits/Spies) trafficked silver dollars and disrupted the market. In addition, transportation has not been fully restored, and urban-rural relations are estranged, leading to rising prices. Since late June, the provincial bank and branches in Huanggang, Xiaogan, etc., have cooperated with the government's various measures to prohibit the circulation of silver dollars, organized work in various counties, towns, and rural areas, and used various methods to carry out propaganda, calling for the launch of a movement to reject silver dollars, establish the prestige of the RMB, and cooperate with the government to organize a large number of transportation to promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and invigorate trade relations. In the past month, prices have generally fallen by one-third, and the RMB has begun to gradually occupy the rural market. Based on the work situation in this stage, the Provincial Bank has formulated a work plan for July, August and September, determining that the central task in these three months is first to establish and improve the organizational structure of various branches, streamline the organization of the Provincial Bank, and draw cadres to strengthen lower-level organizations, so that the branches in Xiangfan, Jiangling and other places that are still working in conjunction with the Bureau of Industry and Commerce will establish independent institutions by the end of August, and all those that have not established county banks will be established. Establish a strict system of requesting instructions and reporting. Strengthen learning to improve political awareness and professional skills. At the same time, it is necessary to actively organize the currency to go to the countryside, set up exchange offices, and continue to lead the people to implement the movement to reject silver dollars. And closely cooperate with cadres and the masses to deeply understand the specific situation of the market, strengthen analysis and research, and cooperate with trade companies to earnestly assume the responsibility of leading the market. Focus on developing banking business, organizing people in Mianyang and Huanggang districts to produce for famine relief, and providing loans for cooperation, transportation, and production to support production, marketing, and the export of mountain goods. It is also planned to establish remittance business in more than 20 places including Songbu, Wuxue, Konglong, Huanggang, Echeng, Yangxin, Xianning, Huangpi, Xiaogan, Yingcheng, Jianli, Xindi, Puqi, Jiayu, Yichang, Shashi, Xiangfan, Laohekou, Gucheng, and Wuhan, first communicating with the branches, and gradually communicating with the counties and important towns.

　　人民银行湖北分行建立各县分支行
  　积极领导人民拒用银元
    推行本币下乡
  　打击奸商匪特依托农村捣乱市场
    一个月来物价已普降三分之一
    【湖北讯】中国人民银行湖北分行自在孝感、黄冈、沔阳、大冶、襄阳、江陵、宜昌等城市建立了七个较大的支行及在百分之六十以上的县内建立了县银行以来，各行首先即领导人民拒用银元、推行人民币，以便达到平抑物价、沟通城乡关系的目的。湖北全省有半数以上地区是新区，由于人民币在农村还未完全占领市场，奸商匪特贩卖银元，捣乱市场，加上交通未全部恢复，城乡关系隔阂，致物价上涨。自六月下旬，省银行及黄冈、孝感等支行即配合政府禁止银元流通的各项措施，组织工作到各县、镇及农村，利用种种方式，进行宣传，号召展开拒用银元运动，建立人民币威信，配合政府大量组织运输促进城乡物资交流，活跃贸易关系。一个月以来，物价已普遍下跌三分之一，人民币已开始逐渐占领农村市场。根据这一阶段的工作情况省银行曾订出七、八、九三个月的工作计划，确定在这三个月内的中心工作首先是建立和健全各分支行的组织机构，紧缩省银行之机构，抽出干部加强下层机构，使目前襄樊、江陵等尚与工商局合并工作之各支行，到八月底成立独立机构，未建立县银行的要全部建立起来，在工商业重镇建立起分支行的直属办事处。建立严格的请示报告制度。加强学习，以提高政治觉悟及业务技术。同时要积极组织货币下乡，设立兑换所，继续领导人民贯彻拒用银元运动。并与干部及群众密切配合，深入了解市场的具体情况，加强分析研究，与贸易公司配合，切实担负起领导市场的责任。有重点的开展银行业务，在沔阳、黄冈两个区组织人民生产渡荒，举办合作、运输、生产等贷款，以支持生产、运销及山货之输出。并计划于宋埠、武穴、孔陇、黄冈、鄂城、阳新、咸宁、黄陂、孝感、应城、监利、新堤、蒲圻、嘉鱼、宜昌、沙市、襄樊、老河口、谷城、武汉等二十余处建立汇兑业务，首先与支行通汇，渐次与各县及重要市镇通汇。
