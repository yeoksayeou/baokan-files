　　Latin American Peoples Unite to Resist US Imperialist Aggression
    By  Rodriguez, Member of the Executive Committee of the People's Socialist Party of Cuba

    The war brought some changes to the economic direction of Latin American countries. These changes are: the increase in the proportion of industrial production compared to raw material production and semi-finished product production, the improvement of trade relations between Latin American countries, and the capitalization of domestic capital.
    These changes constitute a basis for the possible independent economic development of Latin America.
    Although the United States is likely to provide economic assistance, it has not taken the path of strengthening the industrialization of its southern neighbors. For US imperialists, the profit from another path is much greater, and that is to turn Latin America into a market for its own goods. The overproduction of these goods is increasingly felt in the United States. Before the end of the war in 1945, during the Chapultepec Conference, the Undersecretary of the US Department of Commerce outlined the principles of the so-called "Economic Charter of the Americas" to Latin American representatives. Later, this "Economic Charter" became the "Clayton Plan." This "plan" was specifically aimed at the tariff rules set by various countries to protect their domestic industries. Clayton demanded that there should be no "economic discrimination." This is exactly the same as the policy proposed by Acheson when he demanded "guarantees" for American investors. Clayton informed the meeting that his country opposed trade controls, which meant that gold would monopolize South America.
    At the Havana Conference held from November 1947 to January 1948, the will of the US imperialists was forcibly implemented. Its delegation forced the conference to approve a charter that included reducing tariffs and eliminating "discrimination" in world trade, thus enabling the United States to invade all markets with its strong productivity.
    This charter prohibits taxes levied on foreign investors from being higher than those levied on domestic industrialists.
    The "Clayton Plan" is the Latin American version of the "Marshall Plan."
    The progress that some countries had made in the past due to the development of the metallurgical and mining industries has been swept away. For example, a steel factory in Brazil found it difficult to sustain itself under the opposition of the US imperialists. US potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, etc. threatened to "destroy" Chile's potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, etc. Due to the scramble for oil mining rights, the regimes of several South American countries have undergone major changes. The military revolts in Venezuela, Costa Rica, and Peru are the best illustrations. The United States openly opposed the establishment of the Gran Colombia Merchant Marine Company formed by Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. Its hostile statements against the company aroused demonstrations and protests in Bogota and Caracas.
    US exporters have poured all their technical and industrial equipment pressure into South American countries to eliminate their competition. When Cuba tried to protect its textile industry with some regulations, the chairman of the American Textile Exporters Association "visited" Havana and made an arrogant speech. Accompanied by the US ambassador, the chairman met with the President of the Republic of Cuba and told him face to face that if these regulations were implemented, Cuban sugar would encounter difficulties in the United States. Similar things happened in Brazil, where American oil companies wanted to take over Brazil's oil reserves, and Dutra himself participated in this conspiracy.
    Before the war, the average annual value of goods imported by the United States into Latin American countries was about 530 million US dollars. By 1947, the value of goods imported by Latin America from the United States reached 3.68 billion US dollars, which proves the extent to which Latin America depends on the United States economically. As a result of US economic aggression, the gold reserves of South American countries have been greatly reduced.
    The imperialist goals pursued by the United States in Latin American countries violated the national interests of these countries, thus arousing resistance from the people of various countries. The Communist Parties of various countries took the lead in this struggle. The working class, through its united organization—the Latin American Labor Confederation—and various national alliances, resisted US economic aggression and political interference. The working classes and their political parties in Cuba, Chile, Brazil, Mexico, and other countries have put forward plans that reflect the true national interests of these countries. The reactionary US imperialists are not just the working class. The imperialists' plans have greatly damaged the interests of the national bourgeoisie of these countries, and even this class—although it is compromising in other countries—has expressed their dissatisfaction with the policies of the governments of these countries that violate national interests. In some countries, this class has even become more active in the anti-imperialist movement.
    Sometimes, at international conferences (such as the Chapultepec Conference, the Geneva Conference), even the official representatives of Latin American countries had to resist the arrogant attacks of the US imperialists.
    At the "World Trade and Employment Conference" (which was hosted by the United Nations and held in Havana), the coercion of the US imperialists also encountered resistance.
    The protests raised by various delegations almost caused the conference to fail.
    Resistance in Latin America is becoming more and more massive. Venezuelan oil workers actively resisted the imperialists. In fierce struggles, the Bolivian working class defeated the reactionary imperialist forces. The heroic people's struggle in Paraguay has made it impossible for the regime that sold the country to the US imperialists to consolidate. The people of Brazil have stopped Dutra from transferring the country's oil reserves to the American "Standard Oil Company." The sugar workers of Cuba defeated the sugar companies' attempts to reduce wages, and the textile workers mobilized to lead the struggle against the American monopolists (American monopolists are trying to destroy Cuba's national industry). Mass struggles have forced the Chilean US puppet Videla to make partial concessions and forced him to release political prisoners and abandon his special powers.
    The struggle facing the people of Latin America is long and arduous. The US imperialists are determined to turn Latin America into a colony occupied by them, thereby clearing the way to a third world war. It uses gold as a political weapon to control the entire South American market.
    Similarly, the US imperialists also use right-wing social democrats and Trotskyites to split the trade union movement and weaken its resistance. Through Ibanez in Chile and Coffiello and Muga in Cuba, they have infiltrated the working class to undermine the unity of the working class.
    The US policy towards Latin America is to maintain national regimes that listen to its dictates.
    The People's Vanguard Party (i.e., the Communist Party) of Costa Rica recently published a sensational document exposing the shameful participation of US Ambassador Thompson in the Costa Rican civil war to overthrow President Picado (the United States has no sympathy for President Picado). In Cuba, the Americans instigated President Prio and Army Chief Macaira to turn against each other, thus placing both of them under their control. In Venezuela, despite his concessions and efforts, Gallegos was finally overthrown under the direction of the military attache of the US embassy. In all actions and conspiracies against Latin American democracy and independence, there is the black hand of US imperialism.
    The people of Latin America are beginning to feel the need to take joint action. The Communist Parties of various countries and the "Latin American Labor Confederation" under the leadership of Toledano have taken on the struggle for unity. Today, the view on the need to strive for unity is spreading to broader democratic groups.
    The progressive forces in Latin America fully understand that their struggle for independence and against imperialism must be linked with the struggle waged by the democratic forces in the United States; they fully know that the best alliance to achieve victory lies in the close unity between the people of Latin American countries and those forces in the anti-imperialist camp, headed by their glorious vanguard—the Soviet Union—which today play a decisive role in the battle for world peace and democracy.

　　拉丁美洲各国人民联合抗击美帝侵略
    古巴人民社会党执行委员会委员  罗德里高兹
    大战给拉丁美洲各国的经济方向带来了若干变化，这些变化便是：与原料生产和半成品生产对比起来工业生产比重之增加，拉丁美洲诸国间贸易关系之增进，以及国内底资本主义化。
    这些改变就构成了一个独立的拉丁美洲经济发展之成为可能底基础。
    虽然美国很可能给以经济上的帮助，但它并未采取加强其南邻诸国底工业化这条道路。对于美帝国主义者，另一条路的利润是更要多些，这条路便是将拉丁美洲变为它自己的货物底市场。这些货物之生产过剩，在美国愈来愈感觉到了。一九四五年大战结束前，正当贾柏德贝克会议的时候，美国商务部底次长向拉丁美洲诸代表概述了所谓“美洲国家经济宪章”底原则，到后来，这一“经济宪章”便成为了“克莱顿计划”。这一“计划”是专门反对各国为保护其国内工业所定出的关税税则。克莱顿要求：不应该有“经济歧视”。这与艾奇逊于要求对美国投资者予以“保证”时所提出的方针，是一模一样的。克莱顿通知会议说，他的国家是反对贸易控制的，这就是说，金元将在南美洲独占。
    在一九四七年十一月至一九四八年一月举行的哈瓦纳会议上，美帝国主义者底意志给强制实行了。它底代表团强迫会议批准了一个宪章，其中包括减低关税和取消世界贸易上的“歧视”，因而就使得美国有挟其强大的生产力侵入所有的市场。
    这一宪章禁止对外国投资者所课的税高于对本国工业家所课者。
    “克莱顿计划”是“马歇尔计划”底拉丁美洲版。
    若干国家过去的因冶金工业和开矿工业之发展而得到的进步，业已被一扫而光了。如巴西某一钢铁工厂在美帝底反对下感到难以持续。美帝的硝酸钾、硝酸钠等以“毁灭”威胁着智利底硝酸钾、硝酸钠等。由于油矿开采权的争夺，好几个南美国家的政权起了大变动。委内瑞拉、科斯达里加和秘鲁底军事暴动，便是最好的说明。美国公然反对了哥伦比亚、委内瑞拉和厄瓜多尔三国所组成的格兰和哥伦比亚联合商船公司之成立，它对于该公司的怀敌意的声明，引起了波哥大和卡拉卡斯的人民示威抗议。
    美国出口商把他们底技术和工业设备底全部压力，投入了南美洲诸国，以消灭各该国对于他们的竞争。当古巴试图以若干法规来保护她底纺织工业时，美国纺织业出口商商会主席就“拜访”了哈瓦纳，并作了盛气凌人的演说。这位主席由美国大使陪同晋见了古巴共和国总统，当面告诉了他，如果这些法规给实行了，古巴的糖在美国将遇到困难。在巴西也发生过类似的事情，美国的石油公司想一把接收巴西底石油储藏，都特拉本人即参与了这一阴谋。
    大战前，美国输入拉丁美洲诸国的物资，每年平均约值五亿三千万美元。到一九四七年，拉丁美洲由美国输入的物资其值竟达三十六亿八千万美元，这证明了拉丁美洲对于美国的经济依存达到了怎样的程度。由于美帝经济侵略的结果，南美各国的黄金储量已大为减少。
    美国在拉丁美洲诸国所追求的帝国主义的目的，违反了各该国底民族利益，因而引起了各国人民的反抗。各国共产党担任了这一斗争底先锋。工人阶级，通过它底统一的组织——拉丁美洲劳工同盟，以及各种民族同盟，抵抗了美国的经济侵略和政治干涉。古巴、智利、巴西、墨西哥以及其他国家底工人阶级及其政党，业已提出了反映各该国底真正的民族利益的计划。反动美帝者不单只是工人阶级。帝国主义者底计划大大地损害了这些国家底民族资产阶级底利益，甚至就连这一阶级——虽然在别的国家它是妥协性的——也表明了他们对于各该国政府底违反民族利益的政策之不满，在若干国家底抵抗帝国主义的运动中，这一阶级甚至变得更为积极。
    有时候，在国际会议（如贾柏德贝克会议、日内瓦会议）上，甚至就连拉丁美洲诸国底官方代表也不得不抵抗美帝国主义者底横蛮攻击。
    在“世界贸易和就业会议”上（这一会议是由联合国主持，在哈瓦纳举行的），美帝国主义者的胁迫也同样遭遇到抵抗。
    各国代表团所提出的抗议，几乎使该会议流产。
    拉丁美洲的抵抗愈来愈带群众性了。委内瑞拉油业工人积极反抗了帝国主义者。在剧烈的斗争中，波里维亚工人阶级击败了反动的帝国主义势力。巴拉圭底英勇的人民斗争，业已使得那将国家出卖给美帝国主义者的政权无法巩固。巴西的人民已经制止了都特拉，不准他把国家底石油储藏转让给美国的“标准石油公司”。古巴的糖业工人击败了制糖公司欲减低工资的企图，纺织业工人并动员起来，领导了反对美国独占者的斗争（美国独占者尽力在毁灭古巴底民族工业）。群众斗争业已迫使智利底美帝傀儡维德拉作了局部的让步，并强迫他释放政治犯，并放弃他底特种权力。
    拉丁美洲的人民面临的斗争是长期而艰苦的。美帝一心要把拉丁美洲变为由它霸占的殖民地，从而扫清通向第三次大战的道途。它以金元作为一种政治武器，以控制南美全部市场。
    同样的，美帝也利用右翼社会民主党分子和托洛茨基分子，以分裂职工联盟运动，并削弱其抵抗。通过智利底易朋莱兹，古巴底柯菲洛和牟加斯等侵入了工人阶级，以破坏工人阶级底团结。
    美帝对拉丁美洲的政策是要维持听其摆布的国家政权。
    科斯达里加人民先锋党（即共产党）近来公布了一个轰动一时的文件，暴露了美国大使汤姆逊之可耻地参加了科斯达里加的推翻皮卡多总统的内战（美国对于皮卡多总统是没有丝毫同情的）。在古巴，美国人嗾使蒲里欧总统和陆军领袖大麦拉反目，因而将二者均置之于他们的控制之下。在委内瑞拉，纵令有他底让步和努力，高勒哥斯终于在美国使馆陆军武官的指使下被推翻了。在所有的反对拉丁美洲的民主和独立的行动与阴谋中，皆有美帝国主义底黑手。
    拉丁美洲底人民开始感觉到有采取联合行动的必要。各国共产党以及在托雷丹罗领导下的“拉丁美洲劳工同盟”担负起了争取团结的斗争。今天，关于争取团结之必要这一观点，正扩展到更广大的民主团体中。
    拉丁美洲底进步力量完全明白，他们底争取独立、反对帝国主义的斗争，必须与美国民主势力所进行的斗争联结在一起；他们完全知道，能够达到胜利的最好的联盟，就在于拉丁美洲诸国人民与那些今天在争取世界和平与民主的战斗中起着决定作用的，以其光荣的先锋——苏联为首的、反对帝国主义的阵营内诸力量之间的紧密团结。
