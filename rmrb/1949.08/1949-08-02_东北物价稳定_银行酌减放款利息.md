    [This Newspaper's Report] Due to recent price stability, the Northeast Bank Head Office has re-stipulated interest rates for deposits and loans, and has notified its affiliated systems to implement them starting August 1st.  In the deposit category, except for fixed-term commodity deposits and wage savings deposits with unchanged interest rates, the interest rates for other deposits have been appropriately reduced, with monthly interest rates reduced by a minimum of 0.18% and a maximum of 1.5%. For example, current deposits, originally with a monthly interest rate of 0.6%, are now changed to 0.42%; fixed deposits for six months, originally with a monthly interest rate of 4.5%, are now changed to 3%.  In the loan category, interest rates have been appropriately reduced, with a minimum reduction of 0.3% and a maximum reduction of 2.4%. For example, the monthly interest rate for first-category current loans (classified by object, the first category refers to loans to public enterprises, cooperatives, government agencies, and rural sideline occupations) was originally 2.4%, now changed to 2.1%; the monthly interest rate for third-category fixed-term loans for three months (loans to private processing industries and private commerce) was originally 6%, now changed to 3.6%.
