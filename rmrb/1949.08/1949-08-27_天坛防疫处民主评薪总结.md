Democratic Salary Evaluation Summary of the Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Department

The democratic salary evaluation at the Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Department began on June 1st, conducted in two stages. The first stage involved evaluation among administrative staff. Lacking prior experience in salary evaluation, there was an initial tendency to inflate salaries and disregard the importance of different responsibilities. This was later corrected by the leadership, who organized everyone to study documents such as "Opposing Liberalism," "Opposing Absolute Egalitarianism," and Comrade Chen Boda's "Labor Policy and Taxation Policy for the Development of Industry." A new evaluation was then conducted. They themselves discussed and developed a two-level, progressive salary standard, separating managerial personnel from general office staff. After more than ten days of repeated discussions, a nearly correct result was achieved, concluding on June 15th.

Subsequently, the technical staff began their evaluation, involving a larger number of people and more complex circumstances. Drawing from the experience of the administrative staff's salary evaluation, three principles were established before starting: First, not to violate the salary policy; second, to consider specific circumstances; and third, to fully promote democracy. The process was led by the department affairs meeting (as the department had not yet established a trade union). The department affairs meeting was chaired by the department head and attended by production leaders, worker representatives, and Party cadres, with study group leaders occasionally invited to participate.

The evaluation steps were: First, the department affairs meeting, based on the standards published by the General Logistics Department of the Central Military Commission and the specific situation of the Epidemic Prevention Department, drafted a standard proposal suitable for the department. This was submitted to various groups and production units for discussion, amended based on feedback, and then approved by the Health Department as the basis for salary evaluation. Second, according to the proposal, all employees were divided into four categories: Category A included chief technicians and technicians; Category B included assistant technicians, technicians, and technical assistants; Category C was skilled workers; and Category D included interns and apprentice technicians. The categorization was conducted within each production unit, with original positions serving only as a reference. Third, after the categories were determined, they were divided into groups by category, with each group evaluating salary grades separately. The salaries for each category were determined using a progressive system.

The evaluation method was self-reporting and public discussion, focusing on two aspects: work ability and work attitude. The former accounted for 60% and the latter for 40%, with 100 points as the full score and 60 points as the passing grade. The principle was to prioritize concrete achievements and performance at work, while also considering other factors such as seniority and education. Special circumstances were handled individually. During the salary evaluation process, all attendees of the department affairs meeting were required to delve into the masses, understand the situation, listen to opinions, and identify problems, reporting them to the leadership and submitting them to the meeting for discussion. An opinion box was also set up to encourage the masses to express their opinions directly. Some issues were discussed repeatedly in department affairs meetings and groups, sometimes as many as five or six times. For example, one former assistant technician had served in the Epidemic Prevention Department for nearly thirty years, but his technical skills were not high, and his ability was not adequate. His past work style was also poor, and most of the masses requested that he be demoted to technician. However, the administration believed that demoting him easily would not be good for encouraging long-term dedication to a position. After much discussion, his position as assistant technician was maintained. Another worker's classification, whether he should be classified as a skilled worker or an apprentice skilled worker, was also debated five times. In total, more than a quarter of the evaluations were revised after being identified as having deviations by the department affairs meeting or after being raised by the masses. Some revisions involved categories or positions, while others involved grades. As long as there was any doubt or anyone raised an opinion, the department affairs meeting would patiently consider and discuss it. All opinions revised or rejected by the department affairs meeting were returned to the original discussion group; problems were never resolved through orders or by taking over.

This process took more than a month to complete. Finally, on July 26th, a general meeting of all employees was held to summarize the salary evaluation movement and solicit opinions from the masses. At the meeting, the results of the salary evaluation were approved by the masses, and the administrative leader's summary report was also endorsed. Everyone spoke enthusiastically at the meeting, conducting a general review of the salary evaluation movement. Many people engaged in criticism and self-criticism, making it the most enthusiastic meeting in the Epidemic Prevention Department since liberation. Through this salary evaluation movement, the following gains were achieved:

(1) Unreasonable salary standards were reformed: In the past, the salary of even the lowest-ranking employee in the Epidemic Prevention Department was two or three times higher than that of an average worker (the basic salary of the lowest-ranking employee was 40 yuan, while that of an average worker was only over 10 yuan). The salaries after this evaluation, from apprentice skilled workers to assistants, technicians to technicians, were all progressively adjusted. The salaries of workers generally increased, while those of employees, except for a few, generally decreased.

(2) We learned how to promote and use democracy: The salary evaluation movement was also a democratic movement, and the employees of the Epidemic Prevention Department took a step forward through this movement. At the beginning of the process, some chairpersons were not good at promoting democracy or chairing meetings, which slowed down the meeting process. On the other hand, some employees did not speak at the meeting but complained afterward. After these phenomena were discovered by the leadership, the military representative directly participated in the most typical groups to provide specific guidance. On the one hand, he spoke to the masses, calling for the promotion of democracy and opposing liberalism, criticizing the bad and encouraging the good. By the time the salary evaluation was nearing completion, everyone was able to use democracy, ensuring the successful completion of the salary evaluation.

(3) Some backward employees were transformed: Because criticism and self-criticism were conducted during the salary evaluation, many people recognized and reflected on their shortcomings and were transformed. For example, one assistant technician who used to curry favor with superiors and oppress workers was educated by the masses in this salary evaluation movement and made a sincere self-criticism in the group. The workers also raised many opinions. Before this, he was very depressed and had many concerns, feeling like an outcast. Now, he has been revitalized, starting anew, working actively, and no longer being discriminated against by the masses. Fitter Wang Maolin used to have a bad work attitude. In the salary evaluation group, he compared himself to a seller of sliced cakes, saying, "How much money you give me, that's how big a piece I'll cut." But he was inspired by the salary evaluation, and his thinking began to change. At the summary meeting, he frankly admitted his past wrong ideas and said, "I understand it now! We are now working for ourselves and should take a master's attitude to serve the people. It's not enough to earn more millet; it's glorious to do more work." There were also individual highly educated people who were arrogant and looked down on people without degrees but with twenty or thirty years of experience. Therefore, they reported very high scores for themselves. They also learned a lesson in this salary evaluation and began to realize that they must humbly learn from the masses to make progress.

(4) Unity was strengthened: Before the salary evaluation, the head of one unit had disagreements with an employee, but he did not bring it up at the table. Instead, they attacked each other behind the scenes, even spreading rumors, which seriously hindered the work. As a result of promoting democracy in the salary evaluation, the employee boldly raised many opinions to the head at the meeting. The correct ones were accepted, and the wrong ones were criticized by the masses, so that they both recognized their mistakes. The head made a self-criticism and announced that he would strive to unite everyone in the future, thus eliminating the disagreements. In another unit, there was a small clique that excluded a few employees and engaged in violations of labor discipline such as monopolizing everything and holding small meetings, which seriously undermined unity. This was exposed this time and severely criticized by the masses. Afterward, those who consciously or unconsciously participated in the small clique reflected on their actions one by one and made self-criticisms at the review meeting, ensuring the great unity of the employees.

(5) Work was promoted: In the salary evaluation, shortcomings were exposed and criticized, and advantages were praised, proving that the masses' eyes are sharp, greatly stimulating everyone's enthusiasm and ambition, and thus promoting work. The germiculture room put forward a work plan to improve quality and ensure standards. The penicillin room is working hard to overcome the problem of culture contamination in order to reduce costs and increase production, and is actively researching and manufacturing heat-resistant penicillin. Other units have also put forward production or savings plans.

Although this salary evaluation was successfully completed and has the above gains, there are also many shortcomings:

(1) There was insufficient prior publicity about the salary evaluation policy and the significance of democratic salary evaluation, resulting in some employees not having a clear understanding, not being enthusiastic, and taking a wait-and-see attitude. Some people said, "It's still the same thing. Just evaluate it as it was before." Some people were afraid of the trouble of meetings and delaying work, saying, "Let the superiors approve it casually to save us from having meetings every day." Some people first calculated how many people were in their family and how much millet was needed and then reported how many points themselves. Some people did not understand the current economic possibilities and how hard the vast number of peasants were living and demanded excessively high treatment. Some people became emotional because the evaluated salary was slightly lower. Some people do not understand why the treatment of truly skilled personnel should be high, saying, "Everyone is serving the people, aren't we all the same?" These caused many obstacles to the salary evaluation work at the beginning, which were gradually overcome later.

(2) Too much emphasis was placed on the importance of work attitude. Some people did not have a clear understanding and gave too much weight to extracurricular activities in the work attitude score, relatively neglecting their own work. One technician used to be a technical student and worked hard in his own job, but because he put on airs with the workers, someone gave him a zero score for his work. This bias was not largely corrected until the final stage of the salary evaluation.

(3) The salary evaluation progressed too slowly, and time was not seized, which dragged on for a long time, and the masses easily became bored.

Overall, workers played a decisive role in this democratic salary evaluation. Workers are generally responsible and conscientious, and they have two slogans: "Don't give away the people's millet as a favor" and "Don't bury a good person, don't let go of a bad person." They took the attitude of the master and argued heatedly even over a point difference, and were willing to raise opinions directly and honestly, and could humbly examine and admit their shortcomings. They recognized that millet is the blood and sweat of the peasants. Technician Song Deshan reported 55 points (60 points is passing) because he was unwilling to take more millet. He said, "In the Kuomintang era, I couldn't get 40 kilograms of millet a month. The People's Liberation Army gave me 160 kilograms, which is already too much. I haven't done any work. If I am rated higher, I really don't know how to work to be worthy of it." A technician who was rated for 220 kilograms said: "Two hundred and twenty kilograms a month, more than 2,600 kilograms a year. If I was given a piece of land, I would be exhausted and wouldn't be able to produce this much grain. I feel ashamed, and I must work harder to be worthy of the people."

### 天坛防疫处民主评薪总结

　　天坛防疫处民主评薪总结
    天坛防疫处的民主评薪开始于六月一日，分两步进行，第一步先在事务人员中评议。由于评薪没有经验，开始曾发生互相抬高、不分职责主次的偏向。后经领导上纠正，组织大家学习了反对自由主义，反对绝对平均主义及陈伯达同志的发展工业的劳动政策与税收政策等文件，再重新评定。他们自己讨论出一个二级的交叉累进的薪金标准，把主管人员与一般的办事人员分开，又经过了十余天的反复讨论，得到了一个近乎正确的结果。到六月十五日完毕。
    接着技术部分又开始评议，这部分人数多，情形也较复杂。在开始之前，接受了事务部门评薪的经验，确定了三个原则：一、不违背薪金政策；二、照顾具体情况；三、充分发扬民主。由处务会议来领导（因该处尚未成立工会）。处务会议是以处长为主席，出席的有生产负责人、工人代表及党的干部，有时请学习小组长参加。
    评薪的步骤是：第一，由处务会议根据军委卫生部公布的标准及防疫处的具体情况，拟具一个适合该处的标准草案，交各小组及生产单位讨论，提出意见加以修正，再经卫生部批准，作为评薪的依据。第二，根据草案将所有职工分为四类：甲类包括主任技师及技师；乙类包括副技师、技术员及技术佐理员；丙类是技工；丁类包括实习员及学习技工。类的评定在各生产单位进行，原来的职位只供参考。第三，类别评定后，即按类分成小组，由各小组分别去评薪金的等级，各类的薪金均采交叉累进制。
    评定的方法是自报公议，分工作能力和工作态度二项，前者占六十分，后者占四十分，都以一百分为满分，六十分为及格。原则是以工作上的具体成就和表现为主，其他条件如年资、学历等也予以照顾。如再有特殊情形则个别处理。在评薪过程中所有出席处务会议的人都要深入群众，了解情况，听取意见，发现问题，随时向领导上反映、提交会议讨论。此处还设意见箱，鼓励群众直接提出意见。有些问题曾经在处务会议及小组上反复讨论五、六次之多。例如有一个原来的副技师在防疫处已服务了近三十年，但技术不高，能力不大称职，过去作风又不好，大部分群众要求把他降为技术员，但行政方面为了鼓励在一个岗位上长期的安心工作，认为轻易把他降级并不好，经过多次讨论，维持了他副技师的职位。又有一个工人因为究竟应列为技工还是学习技工的问题也反复的讨论了五次之多。总计在小组评定后经处务会议发现有偏差或因群众中提出意见而加以讨论后被修正的有全数的四分之一以上。有的修正了类别或是职别，有的修正了等级，只要有一点疑问或无论谁提出一点意见，处务会议便不厌其烦的考虑和讨论。凡经处务会议修正的或否决的意见，都交回原议小组讨论，绝不用命令或包办的方式来解决问题。
    这样经过了一个多月才评完，最后在七月二十六日开了一个全体职工大会来总结评薪运动，并征询群众意见。在大会上，评薪结果得到了群众的批准，行政负责人的总结报告也得到了群众的拥护。会上大家发言很热烈，对评薪运动作了总检讨，很多人进行了批评和自我批评，这是防疫处解放以来最热烈的一次。经过这次评薪运动，有下列几点收获：
    （一）改革了不合理的薪金标准：在过去，防疫处一个最低的职员，其薪金也高过一般工人两三倍（薪津基数最低职员四十元，一般工人只十余元），这次评定以后的薪金，由学习技工到佐理员，技术员到技师，都是交叉累进的。工人的薪金一般的提高了，职员的除少数外，普遍的下降了些。
    （二）学习了怎样发扬和使用民主：评薪运动也是一个民主运动，防疫处职工经过这次运动提高了一步。在进行之初，一方面一些主席不善于发扬民主，也不会主持会议，使会议进行滞慢；另一方面一些职工不在会上发言，却在会后发牢骚，这些现象经领导上发现后，由军事代表直接参加到最典型的小组里去具体领导，一方面向群众讲话，号召发扬民主、反对自由主义，批评了坏的，鼓励了好的。到评薪快完时，大家已能运用民主了，保证了评薪的胜利完成。
    （三）改造了一部分落后职工：因为在评薪中展开了批评和自我批评，很多人认识了并反省了自己缺点，得到了改造。例如，有一个副技师过去讨好上级，压迫工人，这次评薪运动中受到了群众的教育，在小组上诚恳的作了自我检讨；工人也提出了很多意见。在这以前他非常苦闷，顾虑很多，象是一个被抛弃的人，现在则已振奋起来，重新作人，积极工作，也不再受群众的歧视了。钳工王茂林过去工作态度不好，在评薪小组曾把自己比作卖切糕的，“给多少钱，切多大块”。但评薪中受了启发，脑筋开始转变。在总结会上他坦白的承认了自己过去的错误观念，并且说：“我现在才想通啦！我们现在替自己干活儿，应该拿出主人翁的态度来为人民服务。小米挣的多不算，活干的多才光荣。”还有个别的受过高等教育的人自高自大，看不起没有学历但有二三十年经验的人，于是自报很高的分数，也在这次评薪中接受了教训，开始觉悟到要虚心向群众学习才能进步。
    （四）加强了团结：评薪之前有一个单位的主管人员和一个职员有意见，但他不拿到桌面上来说，而在下面互相攻击，甚至做小广播，相当的妨害了工作。在评薪中因为发扬民主的结果，该职员在会上大胆的向主管人员提了很多意见，正确的被接受了，错误的被群众批判了，使他们都认识了自己的错误。该主管人员并做了自我检讨，宣布以后一定要努力团结大家，这样消除了意见。又有一个单位内部有小集团存在，把少数职工排斥在外，有包办一切和开小会等违犯劳动纪律的行为，很严重的妨害了团结，这次揭发出来，受到了群众的严厉批评，以后那些自觉或不自觉而参加了小集团的人，一个个作了反省，并在检讨会上进行了自我批评，保证了职工的大团结。
    （五）推进了工作：在评薪中缺点被揭发了、批判了，优点被表扬了，证明了群众的眼睛是亮的，大大的刺激了每个人的积极性和进取心，因而推动了工作。菌苗室提出了工作计划，要提高品质，保证标准，盘尼西林室在努力克服培养染菌的问题，以减低成本、增加产量，并在积极的研究制造抗热的盘尼西林。别的单位也都提出了生产或节约计划。
    这次评薪虽然胜利的完成了，并有如上的收获，但也有不少的缺点：
    （一）对于评薪政策和民主评薪的意义，事先宣传不够，以致有些职工认识不清，不热心，抱旁观的态度。有人说：“还不是那么回事，按原来评评算了。”有人怕开会麻烦耽误工作，说：“随便上级批批得了，省得天天开会。”有人先算好了家里有几口人，需多少小米来自报多少分数。有人不明了目前经济可能性和广大的农民的生活如何艰苦，而要求过高的待遇，因为评定的薪金稍低了些而闹情绪。有人不明白为什么真正有技术的人员待遇要高，说：“都是为人民服务，大家不是一样？”这些都使评薪工作在起初受到很多阻碍，后来才慢慢克服了。
    （二）过分强调了工作态度的重要性，有些人认识不清，把业余活动在工作态度的分数里占了太大的比重，相对的忽视了本位工作。有一个技工原来是技术生，对本位工作还努力，但是因为对工人摆架子，而有人给她工作打零分。这个偏向一直到评薪的最后阶段才被大体纠正。
    （三）评薪进行太慢，未抓紧时间，拖得很久，群众易感厌倦。
    总起来说，在这次民主评薪中间，工人起了决定性的作用。工人一般的负责认真，他们有两个口号：“不拿人民的小米子送人情”，“不埋没一个好人，不放过一个坏人。”他们拿出主人翁的态度，一分之差也热烈的争论，又肯直接了当的提意见，能虚心的检讨和承认自己的缺点。他们认识小米子是农民的血汗，技工宋德山自报五十五分（六十分及格），因为不愿再多拿小米，他说：“国民党时代我一月拿不到四十斤小米，解放军来了给我一百六十斤已经多了，俺又没干什么工作，如果再评高了，俺可真不知道该怎样干活才对得住了。”有一个评为二百二十斤的技工说：“一月二百二，一年二千六百多斤，如给我一块地，累死我也打不了这多粮食，我觉得惭愧，一定得加油干，才对得起人民。”
