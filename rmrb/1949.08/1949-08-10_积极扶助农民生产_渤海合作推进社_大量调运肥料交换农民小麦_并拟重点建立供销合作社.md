    Actively Supporting Farmers' Production
    Bohai Cooperation Promotion Agency
    Massively Transfers Fertilizer to Exchange for Farmers' Wheat; Plans to Focus on Establishing Supply and Marketing Cooperatives
    [Bohai News] In order to actively support farmers' production, the Bohai Cooperation Promotion General Agency has specially transferred one million jin of fertilizer to the Qinghe Special District to exchange for wheat produced by farmers, eliminating the phenomenon of farmers being exploited by speculators in the past. The General Agency immediately organized eight promotion agencies (Shanghe, Huimin, Zhanhua, Lijin, Kenli, Putai, Bin County, and the Second Branch) and two county federations (Guangrao, Boxing), planning to complete the task of transferring one million jin of fertilizer to areas such as Huantai Suozhen within July and August. This task is under the unified command of the General Agency. To accommodate the agricultural season and the convenience of farmers exchanging wheat for soybean cakes, in addition to focusing on Suozhen, multiple exchange points will be established in nearby market towns; simultaneously, supply and marketing cooperatives will be established in a planned manner at these points. It is required to transfer 750,000 jin to Suozhen and 250,000 jin to Shouguang, Linzi, and Guangrao within July and August, and also transfer a portion of night soil from Jinan. Currently, 200,000 jin of soybean cakes have been transported to Suozhen from counties such as Huimin, Shanghe, Lijin, and Zhanhua, with other resources being concentrated for transportation. To avoid price fluctuations during the purchasing process, it has been decided that soybean cakes produced by the oil mills operated by the promotion agencies will not be sold externally but will be traded at market prices for transfer, and the beans stored by promotion agencies at all levels will be exchanged for soybean cakes for transfer to the Qinghe Special District. At the same time, the General Agency decided that in this transfer task, it is required to cooperate with the local Party committee and government, select key points, and help the masses establish three to five supply and marketing cooperatives. In the promotion process, efforts should be made to utilize cooperatives as much as possible, stipulating that cooperatives buying soybean cakes with cash will receive a 3% discount below the market price, and those exchanging wheat for soybean cakes will receive a 7% discount below the market price, with a 2% handling fee for the cooperatives. During market transactions, fair prices should be sought to stabilize prices and prevent farmers from suffering losses.
    [Another dispatch] In order to stabilize prices and supply the masses with the necessary grain and fertilizer, the state-owned store stationed in Bowantou, Boxing, is selling 10 million jin of coarse grains and 20,000 jin of soybean cakes through cooperatives in areas such as Diaozhen, Tianzhen, Tianjiazhuang, Suozhen, Bowantou, Linzi, Shouguang, Yishou, and Guangrao, in a focused and planned manner. Sales began successively in various locations from June 15th. By early July, over 3 million jin of coarse grains and over 8,000 jin of soybean cakes had been sold in Suozhen, Linzi, Guangrao, Shouguang, Yishou, Bowantou, Tianzhen, Tianjiazhuang, Diaozhen and other places. Sales continue to be carried out in large quantities in various locations. After more than twenty days of sales, the exchange ratio of coarse and fine grains has been appropriately adjusted. Before the sales, one jin of wheat could be exchanged for 1.4 jin of sorghum, and one shi of wheat could be exchanged for 13.5 pieces of soybean cake. Now, one jin of wheat can be exchanged for 1.5 to 1.10 jin of sorghum, and one shi of wheat can be exchanged for 16 pieces of soybean cake, changing the previous phenomenon of equal prices for coarse and fine grains after the wheat harvest, expensive fertilizer prices, and farmers suffering losses.

    【渤海讯】渤海合作推进总社为积极扶持农民生产，特向清河专区调运肥料百万斤，等价交换农民生产之小麦。免除过去农民受投机商剥削的现象；该推进总社当即组织了八个推进社（商河、惠民、沾化、利津、垦利、蒲台、滨县、二分社），两个县联社（广饶、博兴），计划在七、八两月内完成向桓台索镇等地调运百万斤肥料的任务。该任务由总社统一指挥。为了适应农时和农民以小麦兑换豆饼的便利，除以索镇为重点外，并在附近各集镇设立多处兑换点；同时在这些点上有计划的建立供销合作社。要求七、八两个月内调运索镇七十五万斤，寿光、临淄、广饶二十五万斤；并从济南调运一部分大粪。现已由惠民、商河、利津、沾化等县运至索镇豆饼二十万斤，其他正在集中人力物力进行调运中。为在收购中避免物价波动，决定推进社经营之油坊所产的豆饼，一律不向外卖，按市价作交易调运，并将各级推进社所存之豆子，或换成豆饼向清河专区调运。同时总社决定：在这次调运任务中，要求作到配合当地党委和政府，选择重点，帮助群众建立三至五处供销合作社。在推销中并求尽量通过合作社，规定合作社以款来买豆饼者，低于市价百分之三，以小麦兑换豆饼者低于市价百分之七，并给合作社百分之二的手续费；在市场交易时，以公道价格，求其稳定物价，不使农民吃亏。
    【又讯】为稳定物价，供给群众粮食、肥料需要，驻博兴湾头的公营商店通过合作社在刁镇、田镇、田家庄、索镇、湾头、临淄、寿光、益寿、广饶等地，有重点有计划的出售粗粮一千万斤，豆饼二万斤。自六月十五日各地即先后开始出售，至七月上旬，索镇、临淄、广饶、寿光、益寿、湾头、田镇、田家庄、刁镇等地已售出粗粮三百余万斤，豆饼八千余斤。现在各地仍在继续大量出卖。经过二十余天的出售，适当的调整了粗细粮的交换比例，在未出售前，每斤小麦换高粱一斤四两，每石小麦换豆饼十三片半，现在每斤小麦换高粱一斤半至一斤十两，每石小麦换豆饼十六片，改变了以往麦子下来后粗细粮价格相等，肥料价格昂贵，农民吃亏的现象。
