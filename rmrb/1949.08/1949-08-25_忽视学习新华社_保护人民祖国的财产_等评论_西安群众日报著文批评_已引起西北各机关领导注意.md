    [Xi'an News] After the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued a notice on July 7th to study Xinhua News Agency's short commentary "Eliminate Complacency, Suppress Special Agent Bandits" and documents such as "Protect the People's Motherland's Property", most organs in Xi'an City did not seriously study them. In some organs, the leadership did not pay close attention. For example, in units such as the Civil Affairs Department of the Border Region Government, although study plans and arrangements had been made earlier, things were still left to drift. Some departments of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee even postponed the study with the excuse of "being too busy" after the general branch of the bureau was suggested to arrange the study twice. Some organs simply ignored it and remained silent. These situations show a serious neglect of the instructions of the superior party, and it would be very serious to let it develop. Therefore, the Xi'an Masses Daily published a short commentary, deeply criticizing the attitude of the leaders of various organs towards the study. The commentary called on all organs to earnestly carry out study, raise questions, conduct in-depth discussions, review work, and make resolutions. It then continued: The negligent attitude adopted in the study reflects that the ideological level of many of our comrades, especially some leading comrades, is not yet high, and their leadership is insufficient. They still do not understand the important significance of this study for the current work, are not good at guiding the attention of cadres to care about and solve the important problems of the current, and are not good at guiding cadres ideologically and organizing the strength of cadres to strive for the completion of the party's current tasks. This is still a backward leadership method of inverting priorities. If this method is not changed, we will not be able to adapt to the current working environment, we will not be able to fully implement the Northwest Bureau's instructions on the on-the-job cadre study this year; therefore, the ideological level and policy views of cadres will not be able to improve, the phenomenon of being busy and chaotic will be difficult to overcome, and our work will not be able to be fundamentally improved.
    The publication of this commentary has attracted the attention of organs in various places. The Logistics Political Department of the Northwest Military Region and other units have re-arranged their studies based on the commentary. Study committees have been widely established in various units of the Municipal Government. Some departments that did not pay enough attention to the study in the past are now correcting their mistakes.

　　忽视学习新华社“保护人民祖国的财产”等评论
    西安群众日报著文批评
  　已引起西北各机关领导注意
    【西安讯】中共中央西北局于七月七日发出学习新华社短评“消灭麻痹倾向，扑灭特务匪徒”、“保护人民祖国的财产”等文件的通知后，西安市一般机关都没有认真进行学习。有的机关，领导上抓得不紧，如象边区政府民政厅等单位，虽然对学习早已也有了计划，有了布置，但依然自流了。中共西北局某些部门，甚至有的经下面两次建议该局总支部布置学习，结果都以“工作太忙”为词停搁下来。若干机关则更听之任之，不声不响。这些情况，都是对于上级党的指示存在严重的轻忽态度，任其发展是非常严重的，因此西安群众日报特发表短论，深刻批评了各机关领导对学习的态度。评论于要求各机关认真展开学习，提出问题，深入讨论，检讨工作，作出决议之后，继称：学习中采取轻忽态度，反映了我们许多同志特别是某些领导同志的思想水平还不高，领导力还不足，他们尚不懂得这种学习对于当前工作的重要意义，不善于把干部的注意力引导去关心和解决当前的重要问题，不善于从思想上指导干部、组织干部的力量为完成党的当前任务而努力，这仍是轻重倒置的落后的领导方法，这种方法若不改变，我们就不能够适应当前的工作环境，就不能够完全实行西北局关于今年在职干部学习的指示；因之，干部的思想水平与政策观点将无法提高一步，忙乱现象也很难克服，我们的工作亦将无法从根本上求得改进。
    这篇评论的发表，已引起各地机关的注意。西北军区后勤政治部等单位，根据了评论重新布置学习。市府各单位普遍建立了学委会。若干过去不够重视学习的部门已正在纠正中。
