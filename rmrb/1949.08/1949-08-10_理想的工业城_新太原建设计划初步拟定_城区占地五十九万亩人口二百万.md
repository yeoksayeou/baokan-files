    Ideal Industrial City
    Preliminary Construction Plan for New Taiyuan Drafted
    City area occupies 590,000 mu, population 2 million.
    [Taiyuan News] The Taiyuan Municipal Government Construction Bureau, after more than a month of research and surveying, and after widely soliciting opinions from architectural engineers, has recently formulated a preliminary plan for the construction of New Taiyuan. According to the plan, New Taiyuan will become an industrial city occupying 590,000 mu, with a population of 2 million. The main part of the city - the vast area west of the Fen River, with its abundant coal and iron deposits in the West Mountain, is an ideal industrial zone. South of the city, from Shouyi Gate southward, a 15-kilometer-long, 50-meter-wide avenue is planned. The area east of the avenue to the railway will be the commercial district, and the area west of the avenue will be developed as a residential area. Provincial administrative offices will be located within the city, while municipal administrative offices will be located between the southern part of the city and the commercial district. The higher education area should be quiet, and is planned to be located near Jin祠 (Jin Ci, Ancestral Hall). In addition, two parks will be built, one at the Shuangta Temple (Double Pagoda Temple) and the other on the west side of the new residential area, between it and the Fen River. The plan will be carried out in three phases. The first phase will be two years, starting with the construction of the commercial district in the south of the city. Surveying has already begun.

    理想的工业城
    新太原建设计划初步拟定
    城区占地五十九万亩人口二百万
    【太原讯】太原市府建设局经月余之研究勘测，并广泛征集建筑工程家的意见，顷已制定新太原建设初步计划。按照这个计划的规定，新太原将成为一个占地五十九万亩，人口二百万的工业都市。该市的主要部分——汾河以西地区广阔，且西山煤铁蕴藏丰富，为理想的工业区。城南从首义门起，向南计划修一长十五公里、宽五十公尺之大马路，该路东至铁路间为商业区，路西辟为居民住宅区。省级行政区设城内，市行政区则设城南与商业区之间。高等教育区以清静为宜，计划设晋祠附近。另外建公园二处，一在双塔寺，一在新住宅区西面与汾河间。计划将分三期进行，第一期二年，首先建设城南商业区，现已开始测量。
