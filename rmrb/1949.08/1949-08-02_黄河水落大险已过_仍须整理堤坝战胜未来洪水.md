    Yellow River Water Level Recedes, Great Danger Passed;
    Still Necessary to Consolidate Dikes to Conquer Future Floods
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Yellow River water level has generally receded, and the great danger has passed. On July 28th, in one day, the water level at Guantai fell by 0.46 meters, at Gaocun by 0.5 meters, and at Juancheng by 0.3 meters. The Zhukou Dam, after a day and night of emergency repairs, has been raised 0.3 meters above the water surface, and the dam head has been largely restored with bricks and willow. The Jiangsu dam's dangerous works have also been repaired. From the 25th, after five days and nights of repair, defense, and rescue, the great danger was safely overcome. Currently, the Yellow River Commission is leading the laborers to continue consolidating the dikes, summarizing the experience of this emergency rescue work, and redoubling efforts to conquer future floods.
    [This Newspaper's Special Dispatch] In order to protect the lives and property of the people, the North China Water Conservancy Commission recently issued its Second Flood Prevention Circular, which states in brief: As of July 25th, four breaches or overflows had occurred in the rivers of North China (two on the Yongding River, two on the Jiyun River), with a total of 310,000 mu of land affected; seven locations were actively repaired to prevent breaches, or were immediately repaired after breaching to prevent major disasters (one dangerous work at Guantai on the Yellow River, four on the Yongding River, two on the Hutuo River). The main reasons for the breaches were: First, insufficient preparation work, especially the preparation of materials. Second, insufficient in-depth inspection of the dikes. Third, the establishment of flood prevention organizations and the mobilization of the masses were not timely. For example, when the Gu Village breach occurred on the Jiyun River, the county flood prevention headquarters had not yet been established, and no one was guarding the dikes. Fourth, a lack of systematic and thorough understanding of the river system, such as the Yongding River, where during the spring work, efforts were completely concentrated in the upper reaches, leading to insufficient understanding of the obstruction of water by the Beining Railway bridge and Zhou Liying transverse embankment in the lower reaches, and the excessive thinness of the Wu'an small embankment, resulting in a failure to prepare in advance, and forming a passive situation when the flood came. Fifth, some counties lacked a strong overall concept and were not resolute enough in implementing the tasks prescribed by higher authorities, increasing the factors leading to breaches and overflows. The circular pointed out: To ensure that this year's flood prevention work is done well, it is necessary to: First, continue to do a good job in preparation work and strengthen intelligence liaison. Second, conduct thorough inspections of the dikes of each river. Third, use actual examples to conduct extensive propaganda to make cadres and the masses aware of the importance of flood prevention work. Fourth, further establish a system of responsibility by segment, strengthen close ties between upstream and downstream, support each other, implement the system of leader responsibility and cadre leadership, and eliminate any thoughts and phenomena of complacency and carelessness.

    黄河水落大险已过
    仍须整理堤坝战胜未来洪水
    【本报讯】黄河水位普遍降落，大险已过。上月二十八日一天内，贯台水落○·四六公尺，高村水落○·五公尺，鄄城水落○·三公尺。朱口坝经一昼夜抢修，已抢出水面○·三公尺，坝头已用砖柳大部修复。江苏坝险工亦修复。从二十五日起，经五昼夜修守抢护，大险得安全渡过。现黄委会正领导民工继续整理堤坝，及总结此次抢险工作经验，再接再厉战胜未来的洪水。
    【本报特讯】为保卫人民生命财产，华北水利委员会顷发出第二号防汛通报，略称：截至七月二十五日，华北各河已发生决口漫溢者四处（永定河二，蓟运河二），被灾土地共三十一万亩；经积极修护未致决口，或决口后立即修堵未成大灾者七处。（黄河贯台险工一，永定河四，滹沱河二）。其决口主要原因是：一、准备工作，特别是料物准备不足。二、事先对堤防检查不深入。三、防汛组织的建立及发动群众不及时。如蓟运河沽庄决口时，县防汛指挥部尚未成立，堤上无人看守。四、事前对河系情况缺乏系统周密的了解，如永定河在春工时把力量完全集中在上游，以致下游北宁路桥和周立营横埝阻水，及武安小埝过于卑薄等情了解不够，未能预作准备，洪水来时形成被动。五、部分县份整体观念不强，在执行上级规定任务时不够坚决，增加了决漫的因素。通报指出：要使今年防汛工作做好，必须：一、继续作好准备工作、加强情报连系。二、各河堤防进行缜密检查。三、利用实际事例进行广泛宣传，使干部群众认识防汛工作的重要性。四、进一步建立分段负责制度，密切上下游连系，互相支援，贯彻首长负责，干部带头，肃清任何麻痹大意的思想和现象。
