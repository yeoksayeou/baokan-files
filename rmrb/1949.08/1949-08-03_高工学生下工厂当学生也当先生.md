    High School Students Go to Factories, Being Both Students and Teachers
    [This City News] Zhang Xing and six other students from the Beiping Municipal Senior Vocational School went to the newly built glass factory in this city on July 7th for an internship. They became familiar with the workers within two days of entering the factory. They said very humbly and enthusiastically, "We are here to learn from the workers, and we hope they will help us." Although they are a few young students, they do not have any false or arrogant habits or actions. They are just like family. Every day, they voluntarily help the workers with their work, and sometimes they help the staff sort out goods, move goods, and carry goods, and they are all very happy. From 7:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. every night, they also teach the workers to read and sing, and they are equally enthusiastic. Therefore, it has aroused unanimous praise from the workers, which truly demonstrates a good example of the unity of intellectuals and workers.

    高工学生下工厂当学生也当先生
    【本市讯】北平市立高工的张兴等七位同学，七月七日到本市新建玻璃厂实习，他们进厂不到两天，便和工人们熟悉了。他们很虚心、很热情的说：“我们是来向工友们学习，很希望帮助我们。”虽说他们是几个在学的青年，然而，丝毫也没有虚伪骄傲的习气和举动，就同家人一样，每天他们都是主动的帮助工人做下手活，有时还要帮助职员们整理货品，搬货抬货，精神都很愉快。在每天晚上七点至八点半还要教给工友识字、唱歌，也是一样的热心。因此引起工人致们一的赞扬，这里真是表现了知识分子与工人团结的好榜样。
