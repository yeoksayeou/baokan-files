　　Reducing Costs Is Not Cutting Corners
  　Danhua Match Company Starts Improving Quality
    [This Newspaper’s Dispatch] After liberation, the Danhua Match Company had a good run for a while; however, because the factory was single-mindedly pursuing excessive profits, repeatedly reducing costs to the point of shoddy workmanship, the business was ruined again as a result. In June, Danhua used very poor quality yellow paper to paste the matchboxes, resulting in most of the boxes filled with matches being broken, so they had to pack fewer matches. The splint department switched to using rotten stalks, resulting in inferior products and a sharp decline in production. As a result, the price of the products could not be equated with matches from other factories and had to be sold cheaply. Because the quality was so poor, customers were very dissatisfied, and sales deteriorated. The factory calculated the accounts and found that using inferior paper for the boxes alone resulted in a loss of 400,000 yuan. Adding the low selling price, it was not worth it compared to the saved raw materials. At this point, the factory saw that their practice of shoddy workmanship was completely different from genuinely saving raw materials and reducing costs. Therefore, starting this month, they changed their approach, no longer selling double-headed matches, no longer using broken stalks, and enlarging the match heads to improve product quality and promote sales.

　　降低成本不是粗制滥造
  　丹华火柴公司着手提高质量
    【本报讯】解放后的丹华火柴公司，曾做了一段时间的好生意；可是由于厂方一心贪图过分的利润，一再降低成本，弄到粗制滥造的地步，结果又把生意做坏了。六月份，丹华使用了很坏的黄纸糊火柴盒，结果装满火柴的盒子多半破裂，只好少装。排轴部改用烂梗子，产品低劣，产量锐减。这一来，产品价格不能和别厂的火柴等同起来，只好贱卖。由于货色太差，购户很不满意，销路越来越坏。厂方算了算帐，光用劣纸糊盒一项，就损失四十万元，加上卖的价钱低，与省下的原料一比，很不合算。这时，厂方看到自己那种粗制滥造的做法，和真正的节省原料降低成本根本是两回事。于是从本月份起，转变做法，双头火柴不再装卖，破烂梗子不再使用，并把火柴药头放大，以提高产品质量，推广销路。
