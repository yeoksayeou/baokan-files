"Relapsing Fever" and "Black Death" To Comrades Li Qingmei and Tian Qing:
    Regarding your questions about "Relapsing Fever" and "Black Death," the following are the respective answers:

    I. "Relapsing Fever," also known as "Recurrent Fever," is a febrile infectious disease. Its pathogen is the relapsing fever spirochete, transmitted to humans by lice. After an incubation period of about a week, the patient suddenly feels chills, headache, fever, joint and muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, sweating, coma, constipation or diarrhea, enlarged liver and spleen, and yellowing of the skin. Sometimes there are also red spots or ecchymoses (which can lead to miscarriage in pregnant women). After five or six days, the body temperature drops sharply, and these symptoms gradually disappear. After a week of intermission, it recurs as before, but the illness is milder. It heals after repeating three or four times. The mortality rate is low, but the recovery period is long.

    Treatment: Injection of "Compound 914" is highly effective, and body temperature can drop within a few hours or a day. A single ordinary injection is sufficient, at a dose of 0.3-0.45 grams.

    Prevention: The main methods are isolating patients and eliminating lice, thoroughly steaming and boiling the patient's clothing and bedding, paying attention to the cleanliness of personal clothing and bedding, and launching a lice extermination campaign in all group residences during the winter season.

    II. "Black Death," also known as "Plague," is a severe infectious disease. Its pathogen is the plague bacillus, transmitted to humans by rat fleas. The incubation period is three to five days, and the onset is very rapid, with body temperature above 104 degrees, chills, headache, vomiting, rapid pulse and breathing, anxious facial expression, red eyes, and impaired consciousness. Generally, without treatment, most people die within three to five days. There are three common types of this disease: one is bubonic plague, mainly characterized by swollen and painful lymph nodes, which later soften and suppurate more commonly, often occurring in the inguinal lymph nodes; one is pneumonic plague, mostly transmitted by coughing droplets from patients, with patients exhibiting purple skin, coughing up sputum and blood; one is septicemic plague, with ecchymoses or purpura on the skin, even local necrosis, and cardiac paralysis. Some people look fine but suddenly collapse and die. In addition, there are cutaneous and ocular types, the former with pustules on the skin, and the latter with eyes resembling draining abscesses.

    Treatment: Nursing should be conducted according to infectious disease nursing methods. If bubonic plague is observed, it should be incised and drained. Large doses of sulfadiazine or anti-plague serum can be administered.

    Prevention: Absolutely isolate patients. Family members and caregivers who come into contact with patients must pay special attention to preventing flea bites. The bodies of deceased patients should be burned, and rats and rat fleas should be thoroughly eliminated. Pay attention to the cleanliness of clothing and rooms, and inject plague vaccine.

### “回归热”和“黑死病”

　　“回归热”和“黑死病”李清梅、田清＠同志：
    你们所问的“回归热”和“黑死病”，兹分别解答于后：
    一、“回归热”又名“再归热”，是一种热性传染病。其病原为回归热螺旋体，经虱子传到人体，经过一周左右的潜伏期，病者突觉恶寒战怵，头痛发烧，关节肌肉疼痛，恶习呕吐，出汗昏迷，便秘或腹泻，肝脾肿大，皮肤发黄，有时还有红斑或瘀斑（孕妇可致流产），五六天后体温骤降，这些病状也逐渐不见了，经一周的间歇期再发作如前，但病势减轻，这样反复三四次后则愈，死亡率较低，但恢复期长。
    治疗法：注射“九一四”有特效，体温可在几小时或一天内下降。普通注射一次即可，剂量为０．３—０．４５克。
    预防法：主要在隔离病人及灭虱，彻底蒸煮病人衣被，注意个人衣被的清洁，各团体居住之处，在冬令时节要发动灭虱运动。
    二、“黑死病”又名“鼠疫”，是一种剧烈的传染病。其病原为鼠疫杆菌，经鼠蚤传到人体，潜伏期三到五天，起病很急，体温在一百零四度以上，恶寒头痛呕吐，脉搏呼吸变快，面色焦燥，眼发红，神志不清。一般的不得以治疗，大多数三两天内死亡，该病常见者有三种型：一为腺鼠疫，主要为淋巴腺红肿疼痛，后来可变软化脓较多见，多发生在鼠蹊淋巴腺，一为肺鼠疫多系病人之咳痰飞沫传染，病人皮肤发紫，咳痰咳血；一为败血性鼠疫，皮肤有瘀斑或紫瘢，甚至局部坏死，心脏麻痹，有人外表很好，但卒然倒地即死。此外还有皮肤型及眼型，前者皮肤生脓泡，后者眼似脓漏眼。
    治疗法：按传染病护理法护理，如见腺鼠疫应切开排脓，可服大量磺胺啶，或打抗鼠疫血清。
    预防法：绝对隔离病人，接触病人的家属和护理人必须特别注意预防鼠蚤咬叮。病人死后要烧掉，彻底消灭老鼠与鼠蚤，注意衣室清洁，注射鼠疫疫苗。
