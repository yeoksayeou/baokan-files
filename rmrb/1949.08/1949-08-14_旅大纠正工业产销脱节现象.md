Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, August 13th: To correct the past phenomenon of disconnect between industrial production and sales in the Lü (Shun) Da (Lian) area, the Administrative Office of the Lüda area has decided that, starting from August 5th, the Industry Department will cease its product sales work and concentrate on studying how to reduce costs and improve quality, striving for high quality and low prices. Except for some products sold locally by factories, all products will be handed over to the Commerce Department for sales. The main raw materials required by industry will also be the responsibility of the Commerce Department for procurement and supply. In general, foreign trade contracts, except for shipbuilding, will be signed by the Commerce Department. The main business of the Commerce Department in the future will be to promote the sales of industrial finished products and to procure industrial raw materials, so that commerce serves industry and trade serves production. The Commerce Department must regularly provide the Industry Department with market information so that production and sales work can be well integrated.

    旅大纠正工业产销脱节现象
    【新华社大连十三日电】旅（顺）大（连）区行政公署为纠正过去该区工业生产与推销脱节的现象，特决定从八月五日起，工业厅停止推销产品的工作，集中力量于研究降低成本，提高质量，力求物美价廉。除部分产品由工厂现地出售外，一律交商业厅推销。工业所需的主要原料，亦由商业厅负责采购供应。一般对外贸易合同，除造船外统由商业厅签定。商业厅今后业务主要为推销工业成品，采购工业原料，做到商业为工业服务，贸易为生产服务。商业厅须经常以市场情况供给工业厅，使生产与推销工作很好地结合起来。
