    Shanghai Supports the Troops
    Companies and Stores Hold Charity Sales
    Employees Eagerly Donate
    Theater and Film Associations Solicit Contributions
    [Report from this newspaper] Shanghai News: Twelve major companies in the city, including Da Hsin, Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, China Emporium, Lihua, Lian An, Hua Xin, and Tai Chang, have decided that the minimum commission for their charity sales to support the troops will be 50 million yuan. If the commission falls short, the companies have decided to make additional donations. On the second day of the charity sales in the industrial and commercial sectors, stores throughout the city were crowded with enthusiastic customers. In addition to the enthusiastic charity sales in various department stores of Sincere Company, the Employee Troop Support Committee also launched a charity sale of toothpaste. Colleagues at a cosmetics factory rushed to produce 10,000 tubes of toothpaste, a task that usually takes ten days, within three days. The Youth Workers Department and Women Workers Department were responsible for promoting the toothpaste in the marketplace. Employees of Wing On Company also launched charity sales among their colleagues. Some donated soap, some kerosene, and some even donated gold rings. They planned to donate all the proceeds from the sales to support the troops. Other businesses, such as paint engineering, warehouses, ink, spinning, toothbrushes, gauze, and rubber shops, have also scheduled charity sales with commissions to support the troops. In total, half of the city's stores have already participated in charity sales to support the troops, and the rest are continuing to contact the Industrial and Commercial Troop Support Sub-Committee to arrange charity sales.
    Additionally, the Theater and Film Association's Troop Support Branch's three-day troop support and disaster relief broadcast has been very successful. It is estimated that the donations received are worth approximately 10 million yuan. The association is also discussing plans to hold a grand garden party in Fuxing Park and will also conduct charity sales. The association's Women's Committee Charity Sale Committee has mobilized and organized four fundraising teams to solicit goods from all walks of life for charity sales.
