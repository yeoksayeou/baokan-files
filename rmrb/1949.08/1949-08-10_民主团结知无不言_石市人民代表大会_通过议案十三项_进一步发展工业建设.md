    Democratic Unity: Say All You Know
    Shijiazhuang People's Congress
    Passes Thirteen Resolutions
    To Further Develop Industrial Construction
    [Shijiazhuang Electricity] The Shijiazhuang People's Congress discussed proposals for seven days, and on the 4th, passed thirteen resolutions. During those seven days, representatives often braved heavy rain to attend meetings, and in the sweltering afternoons and evenings, they fanned themselves incessantly while engaging in serious discussions and heated debates, truly doing their best to "say all they knew and say it without reservation." The representatives recognized that they were representatives of the masses, and they had to convey the voices of the segment of the masses they represented. The People's Congress was a democratic assembly, a concrete realization of the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. The opinions of all classes should be expressed to the assembly. Even when opinions differed on specific issues, everyone remained calm and considered the interests of all classes, handling them in order of importance and urgency, and reaching unanimously approved resolutions. The thirteen resolutions concerning the vital interests of all classes in Shijiazhuang were passed in this spirit of unity.
    The meeting first passed the proposal to "Further Develop Shijiazhuang's Industrial Construction and Transform Shijiazhuang into an Industrial City." Shijiazhuang is located in the center of a vast production area of coal, iron, cotton, and various oilseeds, commands the throat between the mountains and the plains, and is the central hub of the Pinghan, Deshi, and Zhengtai railways. The surrounding agricultural products are abundant, especially after the completion of land reform, which guarantees the possibility of opening up a vast market. There is an ample labor force, surplus electrical power, and light and heavy industries are already in their initial stages. These are all favorable conditions for the development of industry in Shijiazhuang. The development of industry should focus on the iron industry, the cotton textile industry, and industries such as ginning, pressing, and oil extraction. Overcome the blindness of production and strive to create production plans for key industries, such as the iron industry, which should focus on the transformation of agricultural tools and the repair and replacement of parts. Strive to improve management methods, promote joint public-private ventures, and provide support through appropriate loans from the state bank. Under the principle of mutual benefit for both public and private sectors, some industrial products can adopt a state order system, where state-owned trade cooperatives and other departments supply raw materials, pay wages, and collect finished products. To reward industrial research and invention, the congress passed a resolution to organize the Shijiazhuang Industrial Research Association, inviting outstanding skilled workers, engineers, and people with an interest in scientific research to participate, conduct joint research, exchange experiences, and hold regular industrial product exhibitions for mutual observation, with the aim of improving technology, reducing costs, and improving product quality.
    Regarding the development of commerce, the congress passed a resolution: Under the condition of not violating the regulations on the control of the silver and money industry, private silver houses are allowed to exist to facilitate the turnover of commercial funds. When private silver houses are established, appropriate consideration will be given to the time for raising funds and the prescribed amount. However, the government should strictly prohibit private silver houses from engaging in illegal activities that harm the national economy. During the discussion process, many representatives severely criticized the past illegal activities of private silver houses, such as speculation, profiteering, and hoarding.
    To develop agricultural production, the congress passed a resolution on the correct use of agricultural loans, and in order to ensure that the funds are used for their intended purpose, it specifically stipulated a "lend in kind, repay in kind" method. Secondly, it passed a resolution on strengthening the ties between urban and rural areas and strengthening the exchange of materials, deciding to expand the organization of farmer service stations, integrate the work of state-owned, public, and private enterprises with the service stations, and provide farmers with convenience in purchasing and selling.
    The congress engaged in heated debate on labor-capital issues and unanimously passed the "Shijiazhuang City Private Factory Store Employee Wage, Working Hours, Welfare, and Labor Protection Wartime Provisional Measures," the "Shijiazhuang City Cotton Textile Industry Employee Wage, Working Hours, Welfare, etc. Wartime Provisional Measures," and the "Shijiazhuang City Iron Industry Employee Wage, Working Hours, Welfare, etc. Wartime Provisional Measures" proposed by the Shijiazhuang Federation of Trade Unions. The congress also passed resolutions on industrial and commercial tax revenue, etc.

    民主团结知无不言
    石市人民代表大会
    通过议案十三项
    进一步发展工业建设
    【石家庄电】石家庄市人民代表大会，讨论提案历时七日，至四日通过决议案十三项。七天里代表们时常冒着大雨赶来开会，酷热的下午和晚上也挥扇不停地认真讨论，热烈争辩，真正做到了知无不言，言无不尽。代表们认识到自己是群众的代表，他们要传达出自己所代表的那一部分群众的呼声，而人民代表大会是民主的大会，是具体实现以工人阶级为领导的、工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的大会，各阶层的意见是应当向大会来倾诉的，即使各方面在具体问题上发生意见不一时，大家也平心静气的，照顾了各阶层的利益，分别轻重缓急的处理，得出一致赞同的决议，十三项有关石家庄各阶层切身利益的决议案就是在这种团结的精神下通过的。
    会议首先通过：“进一步发展石家庄工业建设，变石家庄为工业城市”的提案。石市地处煤、铁、棉及各种油料广大产地的中心，扼山地平原咽喉，为平汉、德石、正太铁路总枢纽，四周农产富饶，特别是土改完成，保障了广大市场开拓的可能性；劳动力充足，电动力有余，轻重工业已具初步规模，这都是石市发展工业的有利条件，而发展工业应以铁工业、棉织业及弹轧、榨油等业为主。克服生产盲目性，尽量作出重点行业的生产计划，如铁业，应以改造农具及修配零件为主。力求改善经营方法，提倡公私合营，国家银行适当贷款予以扶植，在公私两利原则下，有些工业品可采取国家订货方式，由国营贸易合作等部门供给原料，付与工资，收回成品。为奖励工业研究发明，大会通过组织石家庄市工业研究会，吸收优良技术工人、工程师和对科学有研究兴趣的人参加，共同研究，交换经验，并定期举行工业品展览会，借以互相观摩，以期达到改进技术，减低成本提高产品质量的目的。
    关于发展商业问题，大会通过：在不违反银钱业管制办法的条件下，允许私人银号存在，以利商业资金周转，并在私人银号设立时，资金凑集时间和规定数额，予以适当照顾，但政府应严禁私人银号作有害国民经济的非法行为。讨论过程中，许多代表对过去私人银号投机倒把囤积居奇的非法行为予以严厉批评。
    为发展农业生产，大会通过正确运用农业贷款案，为保证专款专用，特规定贷实还实办法。其次通过密切城乡关系，加强物资交流案，决定扩大农民服务所组织，国营、公营、私营企业与服务所工作结合起来，予农民以购销的便利。
    大会对劳资问题展开热烈辩论，一致通过了石市总工会提出的“石家庄市私营工厂商店职工工资、工时、福利、劳动保护战时暂行办法”，“石市棉织业职工工资、工时、福利等战时暂行办法”与“石市铁工业职工工资、工时、福利等战时暂行办法”。大会并通过工商业税收案等。
