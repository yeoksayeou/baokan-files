    Two Theatrical Essays
    On Staging a New "Match of the Heavenly River"

    "Match of the Heavenly River" is a well-known Chinese folk tale, the central content of which reflects the agricultural society life of men plowing and women weaving. The Weaver Girl matching with the Cowherd is the ideal of rural men and women; thus people imagined "heaven" to be the same, and sang, "On earth, the Kylin matches with the Phoenix, in heaven, the Weaver Girl matches with the Cowherd." This formed a vivid legend and story.

    Imagining "heaven" as an agricultural society of men plowing and women weaving, with the Cowherd matching with the Weaver Girl, is harmless from the point of view of historical development. Only the many strange and bizarre embellishments that are forcibly added under the influence of feudal rule, such as: "The Heavenly Granddaughter Weaver Girl and the Cowherd have a pre-existing marital bond," and "The Taurus Star descended to earth to complete the good deed," are harmful.

    To reform old operas, one should retain or develop the harmless parts of the story that conform to the laws of historical development; and revise or eliminate the harmful parts of the story that have been fabricated or distorted by the influence of feudal rule. The left and right deviations of either canceling or retaining everything must be guarded against.

    This time, staging "New Match of the Heavenly River" for the Zhangjiakou City Liberation Theater is based on the above principles. Therefore, it is first pointed out that "heaven" is a society of men plowing and women weaving, with abundant food and clothing. The Weaver Girl was not originally a skillful goddess who was diligent in spinning and weaving, but a lazy woman who was greedy for play and sleep, delaying her weaving lessons. Because of her laziness, she was demoted to earth, married to the diligent and honest Cowherd, and tempered by labor. Only after she learned to weave, bore children, and completed her merits, did she return to "heaven" with the Cowherd. When the "Queen Mother" appears, she says: "...This heavenly scene is extraordinary. Men and women, young and old, are all diligent and everyone is happy. The men all plow the fields and cultivate the land, and the women all weave cloth and spin cotton, truly with abundant food and clothing, and endless eating and wearing. Anyone who is lazy and loves to eat will be demoted to the mortal realm to suffer hardships. If the mortal men and women are diligent and honest, they can also be promoted to heaven and share in great blessings..." When delivering the decree, she sings: "...In heaven, laziness is punished by demotion to the mortal realm. In the mortal world, diligence and hardship can lead to ascension to heaven..." When the Weaver Girl learns to weave, she sings: "...Men must plow and women must weave, the human world and heaven are the same..." This is the theme of the "New Match of the Heavenly River."

    Based on the above theme, many bizarre and harmful parts of the old Match of the Heavenly River have been canceled or revised. For example: the "Jade Emperor" has been canceled, the "Taurus Star" has been canceled; the Cowherd is not a slick and handsome young man, but a farmer weathered by wind and rain; the old ox, symbolizing labor, is not skinned, but ascends to heaven with the Cowherd, etc. At the same time, some interesting and harmless parts of the old Match of the Heavenly River have also been retained, such as: the Cowherd being abused by his elder brother and sister-in-law, bathing in the lotus pond, and the magpie bridge arranging lamps, etc. In addition, some new scenes have also been added, such as: the Cowherd plowing the fields, sweeping the floor, and going up the mountain to herd cattle (singing specially made songs), the Weaver Girl being lazy in the garden, learning to weave, etc. As for unnecessary embellishments, such as real cattle on stage, grand magic tricks, and men and women playing opposite roles, they are all not adopted.

    During rehearsals, some actors suddenly shouted: "This heaven is just like the old liberated area!"

    Thus, we believe that the "New Match of the Heavenly River" can give the working people a more intimate feeling.

    论剧两题
    关于排演新“天河配”
    “天河配”是中国民间有名的故事，中心内容是反映男耕女织的农业社会生活。织女配牛郎，本是人间农村男女的理想；于是人们便设想“天堂”也是如此，而说唱着“地下麒麟配凤凰，天上织女配牛郎。”这就形成了生动的传说、故事。
    把“天堂”设想为男耕女织，牛郎配织女的农业社会，从历史发展的观点来看，这是无害的。只有在封建统治的影响下，牵强附会进去的许多神奇怪诞的渲染，譬如说：“天孙织女和牛郎原有姻缘之分”、“金牛星下界成全好事”等，才是有害的。
    改造旧剧，应该保留或发展故事中无害的，合乎历史发展规律的部分；修正或取消故事中受封建统治影响所造作或歪曲了的、有害部分。一概取消或一概保留的左右偏向，是必须警惕的。
    这次给张家口市解放戏院排演“新天河配”，就是根据以上原则。因此，首先指出：“天堂”就是男耕女织，丰衣足食的社会。织女并非原本就是勤劳纺织的奇巧女神，而是一个贪耍贪睡，耽误了纺织功课的小懒婆。因她偷懒，才被贬下人间，嫁与勤劳诚实的牛郎，锻炼劳动，待她学会纺织，生了子女，功果圆满，才又和牛郎回到“天堂”。“王母娘娘”上场时白：“……这天堂景象，非比寻常，男女老幼，人人勤劳，个个喜欢。男的都要耕田种地，女的都要织布纺棉，真是丰衣足食，吃穿不尽。谁们若是好吃懒做，就要贬下尘凡，去受苦难。那尘凡男女，若是勤劳诚实，也能提升天庭，同享厚福。……”传旨时唱：“……在天上，偷了懒，贬下尘境。尘世人，勤劳苦，能上天庭。……”织女学纺织时唱：“……男要耕种女要织，人间天上一般同。……”这就是“新天河配”的主题。
    根据上述主题，就取消、修正了旧天河配里许多怪诞有害的部分，例如：取消了“玉皇大帝”，取消了“金牛星”；牛郎不是油头粉面的小生，而是风吹雨打的庄稼汉；象征劳动力的老牛，不是被剥了皮，而是和牛郎一同上天等。同时也保留了旧天河配里一些有趣而无害的部分，例如：牛郎受兄嫂虐待，莲池沐浴，鹊桥排灯等。另外也加了一些新场面，例如：牛郎耕田，抹地，上山放牛（唱特制歌曲），织女偷懒游园、学习纺织等。至于不必要的点缀，如真牛上台，大变魔术，男女反串等，则概不采用。
    在排演中，有的演员突然喊出：“这天堂就是老解放区嘛！”
    如此，我们相信，“新天河配”，能使劳动人民得到更亲切的感觉。
