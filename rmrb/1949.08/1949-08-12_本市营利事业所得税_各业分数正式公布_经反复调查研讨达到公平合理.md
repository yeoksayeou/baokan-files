This City's Business Income Tax
Official Announcement of Scores for Each Industry
Fair and Reasonable After Repeated Investigation and Research

[This City News] The business income tax scores for each industry and commerce sector in this city for the second half of the 37th year (of the Republic of China, i.e. 1948) were officially announced yesterday (the 11th) by the City Promotion Committee. The total score is 2,000,000 points, borne by 34,994 households across 153 industries. The industry with the highest score is the rice and flour grain industry, with 145,238 points; the lowest is the stone powder industry, with 107 points. The highest average score per household is in the banking industry, with 2,500 points, and the lowest is in the brocade box industry, with 2.125 points. The final decision on the tax scores for each industry has undergone repeated research and discussion, large and small, ten times over the past half month. First, at the same time as organizing the evaluation panel work, the Municipal Tax Bureau mobilized a large number of cadres to deeply understand the situation of each industry, conducted typical household surveys, and studied the general profit rate and business conditions of each industry. On the other hand, the Municipal Tax Bureau accepted the opinions of the Joint Evaluation Committee, referred to the business tax turnover in the spring, carried out evaluation, and then, based on the profit rate of each industry, etc., drafted a preliminary plan, which was submitted to the Municipal Promotion Committee. After discussion and revision, it was announced to the Joint Evaluation Committee on the 3rd of this month. After the Joint Evaluation Committee discussed in groups on the 4th and 5th, and the Standing Committee of the Committee repeatedly compared the scores of each industry on the 7th, it put forward revised opinions. On the 8th, the Municipal Promotion Committee, based on the revised opinions, made detailed discussions before submitting it to the Municipal Government for approval.

This work illustrates that what "goes to the masses" must "come from the masses." For example, when drafting the initial plan, it was not understood that many of the textile and dyeing industries were large cotton yarn wholesale dealers, and the average score per household was only set at 30.03 points. After the masses put forward their opinions, it was later raised to 227 points. The government has given necessary and appropriate care to those industries with special difficulties. For example, the rice and flour grain industry was originally doing very well, but the industry suffered from the destruction of the Kuomintang reactionaries during the "August 19th" period last year. This time, the original draft of 153.3 points per household was reduced to 103.2 points.

    本市营利事业所得税
    各业分数正式公布
    经反复调查研讨达到公平合理
    【本市讯】本市三十七年下半年度营利事业所得税，工商各业纳税分数已于昨（十一）日由市推进委员会正式公布。总分数计两百万分，负担者包括一五三个行业，三四、九九四户。各业分数最多的是米面粮业，一四五、二三八分；最少的是石粉业，一○七分。每户平均分数最高的是银行业，计二五○○分，最低的是锦匣业，计二点一二五分。各业纳税分数的最后决定，曾经过半月来大小十次的反复研讨。首先，与进行组织评议小组工作同时，市税局即动员大批干部深入了解各行业情况，作典型户的调查，研究各行业一般的利润率与营业状况；另一方面市税局接受了联合评议委员会的意见，参照春季营业税营业额，进行评议，再根据各业的利润率等，拟定了初步草案，向市推进委员会提出，经讨论修改后，于本月三日，向联合评议委员会宣布，经四、五两日联合评议委员分组讨论与该会常委会七日把各行业的分数反复比较后，提出修正意见。八日，市推进委员会复根据修正意见，加以详密讨论，始送请市府批准。
    此次工作说明，“到群众中去”的东西必须“从群众中来”，如拟草案时，不了解纺织染业中有不少是大棉纱批发庄，每户平均分数仅订为三十点三分，经群众提出意见，后提高到二百二十七分。政府对各行业有特殊困难者都加以必要的适当的照顾。如米面粮业本是买卖很好，但该业去年“八一九”期间遭受了国民党反动派的摧残，此次评分，乃将原草案的每户平均一百五十三点三分降到一百零三点二分。
