    [This City News] The Land Survey Team of the Land Administration Bureau has completed the land survey work in the northeastern suburbs ahead of schedule, saving 8,550 units of labor, equivalent to 74,100 jin of millet; saving material costs equivalent to 14,500 jin of millet; totaling savings of 88,600 jin of millet. The original plan of the Land Administration Bureau was to complete the survey of 110,000 mu of land in the northeastern suburbs in four months from April to July. The 133 staff members of the survey team were divided into three groups. Each group was managed by a team leader in charge of surveying operations, and a surveyor was also assigned to be responsible for checking the accuracy of the results. The survey work was divided into three parts: small triangulation survey, traverse survey, and household land survey. The small triangulation survey was originally done last year, but some of the survey stakes were destroyed by artillery fire during the siege, so they were replenished this year; the traverse survey required more people; the household land survey required even more people. Therefore, the employees of the survey team this time, in coordination with the survey sequence, each group was divided into two departures, the first time to carry out small triangulation surveys and traverse surveys, and the second time to carry out land clearing (household land surveys). Originally scheduled to depart on April 1, but because the preparatory work was not completed in time, the first and third groups did not depart until April 11, and the second group waited for the small triangulation survey results and did not depart until April 21. However, thanks to the active efforts of the staff, the first group returned to the bureau on June 25, the third group on June 30, and the second group on July 5, completing the plan ahead of schedule. More than 360 original cadastral maps of 110,000 mu of land have all been surveyed and mapped.
    The main reasons why the survey team exceeded the plan this time are: First, the combination of work and study was good. The staff seized the time to study in the gaps of business according to different locations and situations, and all problems were linked to practical work. Some old-fashioned ideas were criticized, and the concept of employment was initially broken. Second, the leadership was democratic, constantly reviewing the advantages and disadvantages of the work, encouraging each other, and concentrating efforts towards the goal of completing the plan ahead of schedule. Wang Zhao, the inspector of the first group, was seriously divorced from the masses in the first month of work. After everyone raised it at the review meeting, the performance in the later work was very good; Bai Jianzhang, a surveyor in the third group, repaired the survey rope and restored it as new, and the leadership immediately praised him. The teams challenged each other, and the mood became increasingly high. Third, the survey team had good contact with the masses and obtained their assistance. They lived in the homes of farmers, sweeping the floors and fetching water for the farmers every day; helping the villagers pull wheat during the busy farming season, and teaching children to sing in their spare time. Everyone seemed like a family. Before the three groups completed their tasks and returned to the bureau, they held evening parties with the farmers to solicit opinions from the masses. Men, women, old and young people from nearby came to participate, and it was very cordial. (Yan Shizeng)

    东北郊区土地测量提前完成
    节省工料合米九万斤
    【本市讯】地政局土地测量队提前完成东北郊区土地测量工作，节省人工八、五五○个，折合小米七四、一○○斤；节省材料费小米一四、五○○斤；共计节省小米八八、六○○斤。地政局原来的计划，是要在四月至七月四个月内，完成东北郊区十一万市亩土地的测量工作。测量队一百三十三名职工分三组进行工作。每组由组长管理测量业务，另外设检查员一人，负责检查成果的精度。测量工作分为小三角测量、导线测量与户地测量三部，小三角测量原来是去年作好的，因为在围城期间有一部分标桩毁于炮火，今年又重补一些；导线测量需要人比较多；户地测量需人更多。因此这次测量队的员工，配合测量次序，每组都分为两次出发，第一次先进行小三角测量和导线测量，另一次再进行清丈（户地测量）。原定四月一日出发，因为准备工作未能及时就绪，四月十一日第一、第三两组才出发，第二组等候小三角测量成果，四月二十一日才出发。但是由于职工的积极努力，第一组在六月二十五日、第三组六月三十日、第二组七月五日先后返局，提前完成了计划。十一万市亩土地地籍原图三百六十多张，全部测绘好了。
    这次测量队超过计划，主要原因是：第一、工作与学习结合得好，职工们根据不同的地点、情况，在业务空隙中抓紧了学习，一切问题联系到实际工作，批判了一些守旧思想，初步打破了雇佣观念。第二、领导民主，随时检讨工作优缺点、互相勉励，集中力量向着提前完成计划的目标努力。第一组检查员王照在第一个月的工作中，严重地脱离了群众，经大家在检讨会上提出后，后期的工作表现很好；第三组测工白建章修理测绳整旧如新，领导上即予以表扬。各组间互相挑战，情绪日益高涨。第三、测量队与群众联系得好，获得群众协助。他们住在农民家里，每天给农民扫地挑水；农忙时帮助老乡拔麦子，暇时教小孩唱歌，大家好象一家人。三个组完成任务回局以前，都与农民举行了晚会，征求群众意见，附近男女老幼都来参加，非常亲热。（阎世增）
