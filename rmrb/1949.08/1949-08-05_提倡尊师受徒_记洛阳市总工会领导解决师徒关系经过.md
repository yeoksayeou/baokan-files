    Advocating Respect for Teachers and Acceptance of Apprentices
    — A Record of the Resolution of Teacher-Apprentice Relations by the Leaders of the Luoyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions
    By Our Correspondent Ai Fang
    In leading the workers' movement in Luoyang City, the Luoyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, after taking a tortuous path in dealing with the complex issues of teacher-apprentice relations and labor-management relations, clarified the concept of the correct principle of "both labor and capital benefit from developing production" in both leadership and mass thinking. It further proposed that, under the circumstances where apprentices demand improved living conditions and reform of unreasonable old rules, the leadership should pay attention to acting appropriately and advocate respect for teachers and love for apprentices in order to restore and develop production. To date, the city's teacher-apprentice relations are relatively harmonious, labor-management disputes are decreasing daily, and the number of industrial and commercial households and production capacity in the city have largely recovered to pre-war levels; and preliminary experience has been gained in the work.
    Luoyang City is a medium-sized city located in the interior of the country, with a population of over 100,000, more than 2,000 businesses, and more than 800 workshops and small factories. The city has approximately 10,000 workers, of whom apprentices account for about half. Commerce outweighs industry, and handicrafts account for an absolute proportion of the city's production. These conditions constitute the city's strong feudal and backward characteristics.
    Because the number of apprentices is very large and they are an important force in production, the issue of teacher-apprentice relations is particularly important.
    Leadership Tied Hand and Foot
    In April 1948, our army liberated Luoyang. After entering the city, the city's leadership first saw that the lives of workers and apprentices were very difficult, especially the lives of apprentices. The saying goes, "Apprentice, apprentice, three years a slave." After three years of slavery, the teacher still felt it was not enough, and there was the so-called "serving for another year." At the beginning of the apprenticeship, apprentices had to sign a written agreement with the teacher, stating: "Drowning or jumping into a well has nothing to do with the teacher." This meant that if the apprentice could not endure the life of a slave and was forced to commit suicide, the teacher would not be held responsible. Bosses and teachers had many methods of exploitation, such as extending working hours without compensation; apprentices received no benefits other than food; and extending the term of apprenticeship. In extending the term of apprenticeship, bosses had the method of "exchanging shops." That is, two stores or workshops would exchange apprentices, and after the exchange, the term of apprenticeship would be recalculated.
    Although apprentices did heavy work and exerted great effort, they could not even take care of their own lives.
    The city's leadership had deep sympathy for the painful lives of workers and apprentices. But on the other hand, this foundation of industry and commerce was very weak and could not withstand any twists and turns. Therefore, the leadership lacked a complete understanding of how to lead and organize workers, improve their lives, and protect industry and commerce: they put the two in opposition to each other and could not solve the problem. From April, when Luoyang was liberated, to August of the same year, the leadership failed to earnestly lead the workers to carry out their work for four or five months, showing a temporary phenomenon of being tied hand and foot, which was the reason. Later, the city office's working group went to the factories to conduct investigations and research and ran workers' night schools. As they approached the workers and apprentices, the workers gradually raised their demands, the first being the issue of working hours. The general working hours were fifteen or sixteen hours. At this time, the Labor Resolution had been issued, stipulating that working hours should not exceed twelve hours. At this time, the government convened a forum of capitalists to point out that excessive working hours were wrong and should be handled in accordance with the Labor Resolution. This was in October of last year. The issue of working hours was generally resolved, and the second issue was raised by the apprentices, who demanded that the boss provide them with clothes. Subsequently, trade unions in various industries were established one after another. At this time, the leadership was still cautious. The apprentices rose up and raised their own demands, and some bosses and teachers, in order to ease the confrontational emotions, took the initiative to make concessions. For example, in the foundry industry, labor and management automatically agreed to provide apprentices with remuneration based on the length of their apprenticeship: one dou of wheat per month for the first year, two dou of wheat for the second year, and three dou of wheat for the third year. Other industries also added remuneration to the apprentices, with roughly the same amount.
    Correcting Rightist Deviations Leads to Leftist Deviations
    The above demands of the workers and apprentices were relatively reasonable. But after reading news in the newspapers about criticism of rightist tendencies and not relying on workers in various places, the leadership's thinking fluctuated. After examining rightist deviations, they wanted to rely on the workers to build the city and boldly mobilize the workers. However, at that time, the leadership's thinking was not clear on how to rely on the workers and mobilize the workers. As a result, in the anti-rightist campaign, leftist deviations occurred, which was fully demonstrated in the handling of several labor-management disputes and their subsequent impact. At that time, the Renli and Yumin iron factories, as well as the Xinghua photo studio and a coppersmith shop, experienced a series of layoffs of workers and mistreatment of apprentices. These matters should have been resolved reasonably based on the specific circumstances. However, a deviation occurred in the leadership's thinking, that is, leading the workers to convene arbitration meetings—in reality, struggle sessions—some of which required teachers to bow three times to their apprentices, excessively compensate for injuries, and even require the industry trade union to pay some office expenses and publish an apology in the newspaper for three days. As a result, the capitalists were unsure of the situation and had great concerns. In addition, the seasonal business was bad in the spring, and the business tax assessment for that quarter was unfair. During this period, five or six hundred stores and workshops applied to close down or transfer capital.
    Reasonably Solving Problems, Advocating Respect for Teachers and Love for Apprentices
    This situation aroused serious attention from the leadership. In February and March of this year, some overly leftist demands were raised by workers and apprentices, such as the incident in which Shang Zhiliang, the manager of Xinghua photo studio, beat an apprentice and then dismissed him on a pretext. Many people in the store's trade union advocated parading him through the streets. This approach was also wrong.
    Adjusting labor-management relations and teacher-apprentice relations, and conducting persuasive education for workers, is a very patient task. It is necessary to promote democracy and fully reason things out. It should be pointed out to apprentices that their current and future interests should be to learn skills and have food to eat. Who should they learn skills from? They should learn from their teachers. Therefore, they should respect their teachers. At the same time, bosses and teachers should be informed of the policy of both labor and capital benefiting from developing production, and that workers and apprentices' lives should be appropriately improved, and teachers should care for their apprentices. Based on specific issues, deeply publicizing the policy and enlightening the class consciousness of workers and apprentices. At that time, some practical problems were solved by industry in conjunction with publicizing the policy. For example, apprentices in the foundry industry originally received no remuneration other than food, but now they all have remuneration ranging from one dou to three dou per month depending on the length of their apprenticeship; such as determining that capitalists can dismiss workers if their business is not good, but they must give a certain subsidy, etc. In this way, teachers and apprentices, labor and management, not only initially understood our policies, but also had certain methods to follow. Therefore, the city's current teacher-apprentice relations and labor-management relations have initially embarked on coordination. Now, closed households have successively applied for resumption of business, and the five or six hundred stores and factories that closed down midway have now all resumed business.

    提倡尊师受徒
    ——记洛阳市总工会领导解决师徒关系经过
    本报记者  艾方
    洛阳市总工会在领导该市工人运动中，处理师徒关系、劳资关系这个复杂问题上，过去走了一段迂回曲折的道路之后，无论从领导思想和群众思想上来说，都明确了“劳资两利发展生产”这一正确方针的观念。并进一步提出了：在学徒要求改善生活，改革不合理的旧规矩的情况下，领导上应注意做到适当，并提倡尊师爱徒，以恢复发展生产。至目前为止，该市师徒关系比较协调，劳资纠纷日渐减少，全市工商户数、生产能力已大体恢复至战前水平；并在工作中取得了初步经验。
    洛阳市是处于内地的一个中等城市，有十几万人口，两千多商户，八百多作坊和小型工厂，全市约有一万个工人，其中学徒约占半数。商业多于工业，手工业又在全市生产中占有绝对比重，这些条件，构成了这个城市封建落后的浓厚色彩。
    因为学徒的数量很大，在生产中是个重要力量，所以师徒关系的问题也显得特别重要。
    领导上束手束脚
    一九四八年四月，我军解放洛阳，进城后，市的领导上首先看到工人、学徒的生活是很苦的，尤其是学徒的生活更苦。所谓“徒弟，徒弟，三年奴隶”，三年奴隶之后老师还感不足，又有所谓“效劳一年”。在拜师之初，学徒必须给老师立下字据，注明：“投河奔井与师无干”。这也就是说，当徒弟过不了奴隶生活而被迫自杀时，老师是不负责任的。掌柜、老师，剥削的方法是很多的，无代价的延长工时；学徒除管吃饭外没有任何待遇；延长出师年限等。在延长出师年限上，掌柜有“剪厂”的办法。就是两个商店或作坊交换徒弟，交换后学徒年限重新算起。
    学徒虽然干的是重活，出的力气很大，但连自己的生活也顾不上。
    对于工人、学徒的这种痛苦生活，市的领导上寄予深切的同情。但从另一方面来看，这点工商业的基础，也非常薄弱，是经不起什么波折。因此，在怎样能把工人领导起来，组织起来，改善了生活，又能保护了工商业这个问题上，领导上缺乏完整的了解：把两者对立起来而不能解决。从洛阳解放后的四月，到同年八月，四、五个月中未能认真的领导工人开展工作，表现了一时的束手束脚现象，也就是这个原因。之后，市办公室的工作组到工厂里进行调查研究工作，并办工人夜校，在接近工人、学徒当中，工人们逐渐提出了他们的要求，首先是工时问题。一般的工时是十五、六个钟头，这时劳大决议已经下来，工作时间最长不得超过十二小时，这时即由政府召集资方座谈，指出工时过长的是不对的，应按劳大决议办事。这是去年十月。工时的问题一般解决了，第二个问题，学徒就提出衣服问题，应由掌柜解决。随着，各业的工会都相继成立了。这时领导上还是慎重的。学徒起来了，提出了自己的要求，有些掌柜和老师，为了缓和对立的情绪，就主动让步，如在翻砂业，劳资双方自动协议，按学徒年限多少，规定给学徒报酬：一年的一月一斗麦，二年的二斗麦，三年的三斗。其他各行业也都给学徒加上了报酬，多少大致相同。
    纠正右倾发生左偏
    以上工人学徒的要求，都是比较合理。但以后读到了报纸上各地批评右倾，不依靠工人的消息后，领导思想起了波动，检查右倾偏向之后，要依靠工人建设城市，放手大胆发动工人。但在当时领导思想上如何依靠工人，发动工人，不明确，因之在反右当中，又产生了左的偏向，这从处理的几个劳资纠纷问题，及其以后的影响当中充分的表现出来。当时仁利、裕民铁工厂，以及兴华照像馆和一家铜匠铺，一连串发生了解雇工人和虐待学徒的事。这些事情应当按照具体情况，求得合理解决。但是在领导思想上发生了偏差，即领导工人，召开仲裁会—实际上是斗争会，有的叫老师给徒弟行三鞠躬礼，过分地包养伤费，有的并要给该业工会出一些办公费，登报三天承认错误等。这样一来，资方不摸底，顾虑很大，加上春季季节性生意不好，该季营业税评的不公平，在这一个时期中，商店作坊申请歇业和转移资本的有五、六百家。
    合理解决问题提倡尊师爱徒
    这一情况，引起了领导上的严重注意。今年二、三月间，工人、学徒中提出的一些过左要求，如对兴华照像馆经理尚志亮殴打学徒后又借故开除学徒的事件，店员工会不少的人都主张把他游街。这种作法又是不对的。
    调整劳资关系、师徒关系，向工人进行说服教育，这是一个非常耐心的工作。要发扬民主，充分的讲道理。向学徒提出，学徒当前的也是将来的利益，应该是学本事，有饭吃。学本事向谁去学？是向老师去学。因此，要尊师。同时也要向掌柜老师说明劳资两利发展生产的政策，要适当地改善工人学徒的生活，老师要爱护徒弟。根据具体问题，深入宣传政策，启发工人学徒的阶级觉悟。当时结合宣传政策，按行业解决了一些实际问题，如翻砂业学徒原来除吃饭外无任何报酬，现在都按学徒年限长短有了每一月一斗至三斗的报酬；如确定了资方在营业不好的情况下，可以解雇工人，但必须给一定的补贴等。这样，师徒之间，劳资之间，不但初步了解了我们的政策，并有一定办法可以根据，所以该市当前的师徒关系、劳资关系均初步走上了协调。现在，歇业各户纷纷呈请复业，中途歇业的五、六百户商店和工厂，现已全部恢复。
