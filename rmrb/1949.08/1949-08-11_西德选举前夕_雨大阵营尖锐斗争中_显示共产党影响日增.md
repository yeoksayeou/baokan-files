Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th - According to the so-called Bonn Constitution which came into effect on May 23rd this year, the US, Britain and France have decided to hold elections for the 400 members of the Federal Council in West Germany on August 14th, in order to finalize the establishment of a divided West German state. On the eve of the elections, the election campaigns of the various political parties have drawn sharper dividing lines between the two opposing camps in West Germany. On the one hand, there are the reactionary parties fostered by the occupying authorities, led by the Christian Democratic Union and Schumacher's Social Democratic Party; on the other hand, there are the democratic forces, led by the Communist Party, advocating Germany's political and economic independence and unification. The entire election preparation work is being carried out under the control and instructions of the occupying authorities in a purely American manner. The occupying authorities have even decided to issue a booklet called "A Guide for West German Voters", openly attempting to force voters to vote in favor of German separatists. The lists of candidates of the reactionary parties are full of Nazi war criminals and Himmler's secret service agents who have been pardoned by the Western occupying authorities. In Dusseldorf and other cities, Nazi party members openly conduct election campaigns. The former Hitler's Minister of Finance and war criminal, Schacht, shouted wildly in Lüneburg to overthrow socialism. The Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Arnold, even demanded a revision of the Nuremberg Tribunal's verdicts on war criminals. Even Koenig, the Governor of the French occupation zone, had to admit: "Nazi ideas often occupy a prominent place in the statements of German politicians." Countering the election platforms of the reactionaries, the West German Communist Party has put forward an election platform to strive for Germany's democratic unification, independence, and the defense of the interests of the working people. The Communist Party's election campaign has been obstructed and suppressed by the occupying authorities. The British occupation authorities confiscated 30,000 copies of the West German Communist Party's campaign leaflets, and the police tore down slogans exposing the occupying authorities' separatist policies everywhere. However, the Communist Party's influence among the people is growing. In the recent municipal elections in Mannheim in the British occupation zone, the German Communist Party won 29.6 percent of the vote, 12,600 votes more than in 1947.

    西德选举前夕
    雨大阵营尖锐斗争中
    显示共产党影响日增
    【新华社北平十日电】按照今年五月二十三日生效的所谓波恩宪法，美英法已决于八月十四日在西部德国举行联邦院四百名议员的选举，以最后完成分裂的西德国家的建立。在选举前夕，各政党的竞选运动在西德两个敌对阵营间划分了更尖锐的分界线。一方面是占领当局卵冀下的，以基督教民主联盟与舒马赫社会民主党为首的反动党派；一方面是以共产党为首的主张德国政治、经济独立与统一的民主力量。整个选举准备工作是在占领当局的控制与指示下以纯粹的美国方式进行的。占领当局甚至决定发行名为“西德选举人指南”的小册子，公然企图迫使选民投票赞成德国的分裂主义者。反动党派的候选人各单中，充满了由西方占领当局特赦的纳粹战犯与希姆莱部下的特工人员。在杜塞尔多夫及其他城市，纳粹党徒公然进行竞选活动，前希特勒财政部长战犯沙赫特在鲁恩堡狂叫打倒社会主义。北莱因威斯特法利亚州总理阿诺德甚至要求修改努连堡法庭对战争罪犯的判决。这些，连法占区军政府总督柯宁也不得不承认：“纳粹思想往往在德国政治家的声明中占显著地位。”与反动派的竞选纲领针锋相对，西德共产党提出了争取德国民主统一、独立与保卫劳动人民利益的竞选纲领。共产党的竞选活动遭到占领当局的阻挠和压制。英占区当局没收了三万份西德共产党的竞选传单，警察到处撕毁共产党揭露占领当局分裂政策的标语。但是共产党在人民中的影响正在增长，在最近英占区曼海姆的市选中，德国共产党得票百分之二十九点六，比一九四七年多得了一万二千六百票。
