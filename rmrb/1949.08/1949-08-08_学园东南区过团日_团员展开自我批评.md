    Southeast District of the Academy Holds Communist Youth League Day
    League Members Engage in Self-Criticism
    [This newspaper dispatch] Yesterday morning (the 7th), over two hundred Communist Youth League members and many students from the Southeast District of the Academy happily spent a "League Day" at the Academy. The meeting began at 8:00 AM, starting with a talk by Comrade Tao @, a political instructor from Boys' No. 2 Middle School, on "How to Follow the Mass Line." Since the opening of the Academy, many League members have felt distressed because they could not grasp the mass viewpoint, and some even became passive. Now, everyone is very excited. Following this, many League members and students expressed their opinions. A League member from Peimanzhong [Peiman Middle School] confessed that she had not fulfilled the tasks given to her by the League since the opening of the Academy. After self-examination, today she made a guarantee in front of all League members: she must become a model League member in the future. A League member from Gaoshang [Vocational School] confessed that he often acted on emotion in his work, criticizing others arbitrarily without understanding them. Many students were very dissatisfied with him. Today he said, "I must try my best to correct this fault before the Academy closes." Following this, a student from Xinsheng Middle School spoke. He said that he was very moved after listening to the profound self-criticisms of many League members today. He himself was previously very vague on the issue of standpoint. When the students elected him as class representative, he refused to do it. Since coming to the Academy, seeing that other schools were doing so enthusiastically, he deeply felt that his previous attitude was unacceptable; he resolved to serve the students well during this summer vacation and correct these incorrect thoughts and actions. Finally, he said, "Recently, I am preparing to apply to join the League. I hope that all League members and students will give me criticism at any time to help me progress." Thunderous applause immediately rang out from the audience. Finally, League members from Peimanzhong and Shandong also made self-examinations on their experiences since coming to the Academy. They hoped that all League members could truly play a leading role in all activities in the coming week. The meeting ended at 10:30 AM in a joyful and excited atmosphere.

    学园东南区过团日
    团员展开自我批评
    【本报讯】青年学园东南区二百多青年团员和许多同学昨日（七日）上午在学园里很愉快地过了一次“团日”。会在八时开始，首先由男二中政治教员陶＠同志谈“如何走群众路线”。自开园以来，许多团员因不能掌握群众观点而感到苦闷，甚至有的消极下来，现在，大家都很兴奋。接着是许多团员和同学发表意见。贝满一位团员在学园开园后过她没有尽到团给她的任务，经检讨后，今天她在全体团员前提出保证：以后一定要成为模范团员。高商有一位团员检讨在工作中往往感情用事，不了解别人却随意加以批评，许多同学对他很不满，今天他说：“我一定要在学园结束以前努力改掉这个毛病”。跟着是新生中学一位同学谈话。他说今天他听了许多团员的深刻检讨后，很感动。他自己以前对立场问题很模糊，同学选他当班代表，他就不干。自到学园后，看到别校都搞得很起劲，深深觉得以前那种态度是要不得的；决心要在这个暑假中，好好为同学服务，矫正这些不正确的思想行动。最后他说：“最近我准备要求入团，希望各位团员和同学随时给我批评，帮助我进步。”台下立刻响起雷般掌声。最后有贝满、山东的团员也作了来学园后的检讨，他们希望全体团员能在今后一个星期中，在一切活动中真正能起带头作用。大会在十时半在愉快兴奋的气氛中结束。
