Resolutely Safeguard the Rights and Interests of Overseas Chinese

The Australian government, in defiance of the rights and interests of our compatriots, has adopted a hostile attitude towards the Chinese people. Under the pretext of the "Wartime Refugee Departure Act," it has wantonly persecuted our compatriots residing in Australia, and on the 24th of this month, it ordered the arrest of 500 Chinese and deported them. On the 28th, it deported another group of Chinese. This consistently reactionary anti-Chinese atrocity by the Australian government has aroused unanimous anger and protest from our compatriots. We extend our sincere condolences to the compatriots who have been persecuted. The victorious Chinese people will never sit idly by and watch any imperialists persecute our compatriots. We sternly warn the Australian government and the imperialist elements in Malaya, Hong Kong, and other places who are persecuting our compatriots that the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate such reactionary and criminal measures that deprive our compatriots of their human rights. All the rights and interests of the Chinese people residing overseas are inviolable. All acts unfriendly to the Chinese people will be duly punished.

　　坚决维护海外华侨权益
    澳大利亚政府蔑视我国侨胞权益，对中国人民采取敌视态度，借口“战时难民出境法”，大肆迫害我居留澳境侨胞，本月二十四日竟下令逮捕五百名华侨，并将他们驱逐出境。二十八日又再度驱逐一批华侨离境。澳大利亚政府这种一贯反动的排华暴行，已引起我侨胞的一致愤怒与抗议。我们谨向横遭迫害的侨胞们致以亲切的慰问；胜利的中国人民绝不能坐视任何帝国主义者对侨胞的迫害行为。我们正告澳政府以及在马来亚、香港等地迫害我侨胞的帝国主义分子，中国人民绝对不能容忍这种剥夺侨胞人权的反动罪恶措施，中国人民在海外侨居的一切权益是不容丝毫被侵犯的，一切对中国人民不友好的行为必将得到应有的膺惩。
