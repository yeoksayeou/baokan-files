"Do Your Public Duty Well!"
Zhou Qin

On June 20th, Yang Old Lady, a 72-year-old resident of Xiaheimu Village in the Chengguan District of Luochuan, slowly walked out of her gate, leaning on her crutch. Seeing that the neighbors' "Red Wheat" and "April Yellow" had already been brought to the threshing ground, and even the late wheat had begun to be harvested, she thought about her own twenty mu of wheat. How was she going to harvest it? Rely on her eldest son, Xilin, who had already started his own family? He was also getting old (52 years old this year) and wasn't good at physical labor anymore. Besides, Xilin also had sixteen mu of wheat to plant, and his 48-year-old wife and two daughters (the elder being sixteen, the younger nine) couldn't handle much. There were no animals either. Old Lady Yang was so anxious she couldn't sleep all night.

June 21st turned out to be a day beyond Yang Old Lady's expectations. Cao Huashan, Director of the Political Department of the Huanglong Sub-district, led six cadres from the city to harvest wheat for her. Director Cao Huashan said kindly to Old Lady Yang, "Old Lady! Your Manfu went to avenge the people, and we are here to help you harvest your wheat!" This left Old Lady Yang somewhat confused. She thought to herself: Where did these "good people" (troops) come from? Are they really going to harvest my wheat? Why didn't they even bring a single piece of furniture? How can I feed so many people?... She didn't say a word for a long time.

"Old woman, do you have any sickles at home? It's getting late, let us hurry up and harvest your wheat!" one comrade urged. But Old Lady Yang's family was very poor, and she didn't have a single sickle, old or new. "Alas! Where would I have any?" the old lady replied with a desperate tone. Director Cao Huashan, upon hearing this, personally went to find the village chief. When he borrowed six sickles, the old lady couldn't help but smile. She personally led the comrades to the twelve mu of wheat field in front of her gate.

The red sun hung high in the sky. The comrades knew that even though they had brought rice, Old Lady Yang couldn't turn it into food. Therefore, they sent two comrades to cook.

The scorching sun made their sweat pour down. Some comrades took off their shirts, others rolled up their trousers. As the sickles swung, bundles of golden wheat lay on the ground. In the afternoon, the comrades had harvested more than six mu of wheat and carried it to the threshing ground, building a neat "wheat stack."

The next day after breakfast, Ma Wanli, Commander of the Sub-district Command, likewise led six cadres to continue harvesting seven mu of wheat for Old Lady Yang. At sunset, Old Lady Yang's eldest son, Xilin, said to Commander Ma, "Please don't come again tomorrow? Let the comrades rest. I can harvest the remaining seven mu." Although Old Lady Yang's wheat had been brought to the threshing ground, if it was threshed late, it could easily become moldy if it rained. Xilin could harvest the wheat, but how would he thresh it? She worried again.

Village Chief Li Hanzhang ran to Old Lady Yang's house and said to Xilin, "Put my ox on the threshing ground for two days first. It doesn't matter if my wheat is threshed two days later." Hanzhang was also moved by the actions of Commander Ma, Director Cao, and others. At the same time, he remembered the instructions of the township head before the wheat harvest: be sure to help the families of martyrs, soldiers, workers, and war support personnel harvest wheat and ensure they don't suffer any losses.

Old Lady Yang was extremely happy. She wanted to share her happiness with Manfu, so she asked someone to write the following letter:

Manfu, my son:

Before the wheat harvest, Mom longed for you to come back day and night. I was worried about how to harvest the wheat this year! Who knew that on the 25th and 26th (lunar calendar), people came from the city, bringing twelve comrades. They harvested thirteen mu of wheat in front of our house in two days, carrying bundle after bundle to the threshing ground, picking it up handful by handful, and stacking it forkful by forkful. I felt really embarrassed. I wanted to help them harvest, but the comrades kindly stopped me, saying, "Old lady, go back and rest! We'll do this work!" They all smiled at me. After the wheat was harvested, Village Chief Li (referring to Li Hanzhang) lent us his ox to thresh the wheat before threshing his own. Manfu, my son! You must know that the public servants helped us harvest the wheat, and the village chief lent us his ox to thresh the wheat, because you became a People's Liberation Army soldier. Now Mom can eat, drink, and dress well, so don't worry. Do your public duty well!

Your Mother, Du

    “好好干你的公事吧！”
    周秦
    六月二十这天，洛川城关区下黑木村七十二岁的杨老太太，慢腾腾的扶着拐杖走出了大门；看到邻家的“红麦”“四月黄”都上了场，迟麦也已开始收割了，回头想起自己的二十亩麦，咋收回来呢？依托分了家的大儿子喜林吧，他也成了老汉（今年五十二岁），做活也不行了，同时喜林也种着十六亩麦，只有四十八岁的老婆和两个女孩子（大的十六岁，小的九岁）都不能顶大事，又没有牲口。二儿子满福，去年二月间自动参加到黄龙分区警备营当战士，今年解放区扩大，被调到咸阳分区去了。满福的媳妇住娘家也没有回来。老太太急得她一夜没睡着觉。
    六月二十一日，是出于杨老太太预料的一天。黄龙分区政治部曹华山主任，带了六个干部，从城里奔来，给她割麦。曹华山主任和蔼地对杨老太太说：“老太太！你满福为人民报仇去了，我们给你帮忙收麦来啦！”这使杨老太太有点莫明其妙，心里想：从那来的这些“良子”（队伍），真的给我割麦哩？那么为啥连一件家具都不带哩？我咋能管起这多人的饭？………她半晌一句话也没说。
    “老人家你家有镰刀没有？天不早了，让我们赶快给你割麦去吧！”一个同志催促着。可是杨老太太家里很穷，新旧镰刀一张也没有。“唉！那里有呢？”老太太带着绝望的口气回答。曹华山主任听了这话，亲自找村长去了。当他借回六张镰刀来的时候，老太太喜的嘴也抿不住了。她亲自将同志们带到大门前十二亩坪滩的麦地里。
    红日挂在中天了，同志们知道，虽然他们带着米，杨老太太是不能把它变成饭的，因此他们派了两个同志去做饭。
    炽烈的太阳，晒得他们汗珠滚滚，有的同志脱去了衬衣，有的同志挽起了裤腿，随着镰刀的挥动，金黄的麦子一束一束的躺在地上。下午，同志们已割了六亩多麦子背到场里，并积起了一个整齐的“麦积子”。
    第二天早饭后，分区司令部马万里司令员照样又带六个干部，继续给杨老太太割了七亩麦，日落时杨老太太的大儿子喜林对马司令员说：“你们明天可不要再来啦？同志们休息休息，剩下七亩麦，我可以收。”杨老太太的麦子虽然收到场里，要是碾得迟了，万一迈到天阴雨湿，很有霉沤的可能。喜林可以将麦收回，但怎么碾呢？她又发愁了。
    村长李汗章跑到杨老太太家对喜林说：“你先把我的牛套上碾两天场吧，我的麦迟碾两天不要紧”。汗章也被马司令员、曹主任等的行动所感动，同时他也记起了麦前乡长的安顿：一定要帮助烈、军、工、战勤人员家属收麦。保证不能遭受任何损失。
    杨老太太高兴极了，她要把高兴带给满福，所以托人写了下面一封信：
    满福儿：
    麦前，妈黑明昼夜都盼你回来，想起今年麦咋收哩？可把妈急坏啦！谁知二十五、二十六（古历）两天，从城里来了，带着十二个同志，两天收了咱门前的十三亩麦子，一捆一捆背到场上，一把一把挑乱，一杈一杈积起来，我看着真不好意思，我也想帮他们割，同志们和和气气的阻挡了我，还说：“老人家；你回去歇歇！这活我们干！”他们都对着妈笑了。麦收回来后，村长老李（指李汗章）的麦还没碾就把牛借给咱碾场。满福儿！你要知道公家人帮咱收麦，村长又把牛借给咱碾麦，这是因为你当了人民解放军。现在妈能吃上能喝上也能穿上，不用惦念，你好好的干你的公事吧！
