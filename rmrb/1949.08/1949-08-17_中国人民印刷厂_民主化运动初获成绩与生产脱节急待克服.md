　　China People's Printing Factory
  　Initial Successes in Democratization Movement but Disconnect with Production Urgently Needs to Be Overcome
    [This Newspaper] The China People's Printing Factory, with 4,000 employees, is carrying out a democratization movement of factory management. In the past month or so, some achievements have been made, but there are still many shortcomings that urgently need attention and correction. In early July, when the movement began, the general party branch of the factory successively convened meetings of party members, cadres, and all party members to carry out ideological mobilization and examine the relationship between the party and the masses. They gradually overcame the erroneous understanding of some comrades who believed that "the democratic movement is to attack someone" and "the factory is too complex, and it seems too early to carry out the democratic movement." The factory's administrative leaders also conducted preliminary inspections of their work at meetings of factory affairs and section-level cadres. The trade union preparatory committee and the Youth League branch also made self-examinations and preparations. In addition, administrative and trade union leaders also made self-criticisms at various meetings and among all employees. However, at that time, the workers still had concerns and dared not express their opinions. Later, after the work team went deep among the workers, held various forums, and strengthened education, the workers boldly put forward their opinions.

    On July 14th, the factory formed a "Democratization Guidance Committee" composed of heads of party, government, trade union, and Youth League units to unify the leadership of the movement. In order to facilitate all factory employees to express their opinions and collectively study solutions to problems, the Democratization Guidance Committee decided to establish a temporary representative conference. On July 27th, the committee drafted a draft election law for temporary representatives, which was discussed and approved by all employees. On August 1st, each production unit elected 91 temporary representatives. Afterwards, according to the convenience of each production unit, seven representative groups were formed. The trade union work team was also responsible for strengthening the education of each representative group, continuing to collect workers' opinions, and preparing to convene a temporary workers' representative conference.

    Looking at the democratization movement of the factory, from the beginning to the convening of the temporary representative conference, the workers have been partially mobilized through various tasks, from having concerns to boldly expressing their opinions. The bureaucratic style of individual administrative cadres has also changed. The administration and the trade union have made preliminary work reviews and self-criticisms to the workers, laying the foundation for accepting workers' opinions in the future. However, according to the reporter's preliminary understanding, the following issues are worth noting and correcting in the movement in the future: After the temporary employee representatives were elected and formed into groups, the work style of the cadres was still the same as at the beginning. When they met the representatives, they solicited opinions, and as a result, they raised the same few issues several times (such as the work clothes issue). In addition, because the problems were not resolved immediately, some workers were dissatisfied, and the representatives also complained that the cadres only solicited opinions and did not solve problems. The cadres did not think of other solutions, but complained. Due to differences of opinion among the cadres, they often held fruitless meetings. In this case, the Democratization Guidance Committee did not study in time to come up with solutions, or some solutions were not implemented. In addition, the committee did not closely grasp the leadership of the various groups under it, forming an organization without work. This also shows that the committee itself lacked clear guidelines and steps in this section, and the thinking was not consistent. In the future, only by overcoming this point can the cadres not feel confused and show helplessness. Secondly, the democratization movement was not closely integrated with the factory's production work from the beginning. The Guidance Committee rarely studied how to discuss production issues among workers and representatives, and the administration did not complete production tasks through the democratization movement, resulting in the phenomenon that the administration only focused on urging production, while the trade union only focused on demanding solutions to workers' welfare. During the movement, the major waste event of a certain unit producing 60 reams of waste white paper worth 10 million yuan in three or four days was not well discussed and studied among the workers and representatives. At the same time, this also showed that the purpose of the movement was not clear enough, at least among some people. Finally, during the movement, we should vigorously carry out education work, improve the consciousness of the working class, overcome some backward ideas existing among the workers, and strengthen the unity between those who came from the old liberated areas and the original workers.

  　民主化运动初获成绩与生产脱节急待克服
    【本报讯】拥有四千员工的中国人民印刷厂，正在开展工厂管理民主化运动，月余来已获得某些成绩，但还存在着不少缺点，急需注意和纠正。七月上旬，运动开始，该厂党的总支部曾先后召开了党员干部及全体党员大会，进行了思想动员，检查了党群关系，逐渐克服了某些同志认为“民主运动是打击某某个人”，“工厂过于复杂，开展民主运动似乎过早”等错误认识。工厂行政负责同志亦分别在厂务及股长以上干部会议上进行了工作的初步检查。工会筹委会及青年团支部也都作了检讨和准备。另外，行政和工会负责人也在各种会议及全体职工当中做了自我批评。但当时工人思想尚有顾虑，不敢发表意见。以后又经过工作组深入工人中间，召集各种座谈会加强教育之后，工人意见才大胆提出来。
    七月十四日该厂由党、政、工、团各单位负责人组成了“民主化指导委员会”，统一领导运动的进行。为便于全厂员工发表意见，并集体研究解决问题的方法，民主化指导委员会决定成立临时代表会议。七月二十七日，委员会拟定了临时代表选举法草案，经全体职工讨论通过后，各生产单位在八月一日选出了临时代表九十一名。之后，又根据各生产单位的便利条件，组成七个代表小组。工会工作组亦分别负责加强各代表小组的教育工作，继续收集工人意见，准备召开临时职工代表大会。
    综观该厂民主化运动，从开始至临时代表大会召开之前这一段落，经过各项工作，工人已有部分发动，从存有顾虑到大胆发表意见。个别行政干部的官僚主义作风亦有转变。行政、工会都向工人做了初步的工作检讨和自我批评，打下将来接受工人意见的基础。但据记者初步了解，尚有下列问题值得今后在运动中注意和纠正的：当临时职工代表选出并组成小组之后，干部的工作方式仍是象开始一样，见了代表就征求意见，结果提了几次还是那几个问题（如工衣问题），再加上问题没有马上得到解决，部分工人感到不满，代表也埋怨干部光征求意见不解决问题。而干部不另想办法，却发牢骚。干部之间由于意见分歧，常开些无结果的会议。在这种情况下，民主化指导委员会并未及时研究，想出办法，或者有些办法也未使其贯彻执行，另外委员会对所属各个小组也未抓紧领导，形成有组织无工作。这也说明了委员会本身这一段的方针、步骤不明确，思想也不一致。今后，只有克服了这一点，干部才不会感觉工作茫无头绪而表现束手无策。其次，民主化运动一开始就与该厂生产工作结合不紧。指导委员会很少研究如何在工人和代表当中讨论生产问题，行政上也没通过搞民主化运动来完成生产任务，结果形成行政还是只顾督促生产，而工会只顾要求解决工人福利的现象。在运动中间，对于某某股三、四天之内生产作废白纸六十令，价值千万元的重大浪费事件，没在工人和代表当中很好加以讨论和研究。同时，这也表现了，运动的目的性至少在一部分人中间是不够明确的。最后在运动中间，还应大力进行教育工作，提高工人阶级觉悟，克服现存于工人中间的某些落后思想，并加强老解放区来的与原来的工人之间的团结。（柏青）
