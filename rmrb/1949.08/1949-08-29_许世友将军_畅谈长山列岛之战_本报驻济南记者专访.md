General Xu Shiyou
  Talks About the Battle of the Changshan Islands
  Exclusive Interview with Our Reporter in Jinan
    [Our Newspaper News] Our newspaper reporter Chen Yongjin reported from Jinan: General Xu Shiyou, who has just returned victoriously from the Changshan Islands, spoke to reporters about the significance and course of the naval battle of the Changshan Islands, saying: The Changshan Islands are located in the Bohai Strait between the Liaodong Peninsula and the Shandong Peninsula, scattered over the sea for about 200 *li*, extending 140 *li* from north to south, including North and South Changshan Island, Tuoji Island, and Big and Small Heishan Islands, etc., a total of seventeen islands, which are the vital sea lanes between Shandong and Northeast China. The area was liberated by the People's Liberation Army when Japan surrendered in 1945. Under the leadership of the Changshan Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, a people's government was established and land reform was carried out. In early 1947, the Kuomintang bandit army invaded and occupied the archipelago, attempting to use it to cut off our maritime traffic between North China, Northeast China, and Shandong, and to blockade the coast of North China. This victory in the Changshan Islands fully proves that the People's Liberation Army can not only conduct modern land warfare, but also more complex and difficult naval warfare. The enemy's plot to blockade the coast of North China has been shattered by the People's Liberation Army.
    General Xu Shiyou excitedly described the scenes before and after the advance to Changshan Island. He said: Our commanders and fighters all embraced the firm belief of "breaking the enemy's blockade" and "resolutely liberating the Changshan Islands" and happily set out towards the sea. The skilled sailors were mostly Party member cadres who had been under the leadership of the Changshan Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in the past. They had quite rich experience after years of maritime struggle with the enemy. The boatmen shouted slogans such as "Fight back to our hometown" and "Guarantee the safe landing of the soldiers." The local people beat gongs and drums and escorted the warriors to the seaside. Many young women also went barefoot into the water to push the boats and see them off.
    General Xu Shiyou said: "This time we traveled with the southeast wind," and sailed smoothly to Changshan Island.
    On the night of the 11th, the People's Liberation Army sped through the dark sea for seven hours and arrived at Changshan Island. Some of the stupid enemies were captured by the People's Liberation Army in their sleep. At 3 a.m. on the 12th, our army landed completely, and completely liberated North and South Changshan Island, Big and Small Zhushan Island, Big and Small Heishan Island, Miao Island and other seven islands. The enemy's naval deployment was completely broken, and the remnants of the enemy on Tuoji Island were completely exposed under the control of our army's firepower. The enemy bandits' eight gunboats and four warships once attempted to counterattack, but fled under the bombardment of our long-range artillery fire. The "Taishan" transport ship and two steamships were all captured by us.

　　许世友将军
  　畅谈长山列岛之战
  　本报驻济南记者专访
    【本报讯】本报驻济南记者陈勇进报道：甫自长山列岛胜利归来之许世友将军，对记者畅谈长山列岛海战的意义及经过情形称：长山列岛位于辽东半岛与山东半岛之间的渤海海峡中，散布在长约二百余华里的海面上，南北长百四十余华里，包括南北长山岛、砣矶岛、大小黑山等十七个岛屿，为山东与东北水路交通必经之道。该地于一九四五年日本投降时为人民解放军解放，在中共长山工委领导下，建立了人民政权，进行了土地改革。一九四七年初国民党匪军侵占该列岛，妄图据以扼断我华北、东北、山东之间的海上交通，封锁我华北的海岸。这次长山列岛的胜利，充分证明人民解放军不仅能进行现代化的陆战，而且能进行更复杂更困难的海上战争，敌人封锁华北海岸的阴谋是为人民解放军打得粉碎了。
    许世友将军十分兴奋的叙述向长山岛进军前后的情景。他说：我们的指战员都抱着“打破敌人的封锁”、“坚决解放长山列岛”的坚强信心，愉快的向海洋进发。熟练的水手们大都是过去在中共长山工委领导下的党员干部，他们与敌人经过几年来的海上斗争，经验都相当丰富。船手们高呼着“打回老家去”，“保证战士们安全登陆”的口号，当地的人民敲打着锣鼓，欢送勇士们至海滨，不少青年妇女亦赤脚下水，推船欢送。
    许世友将军说：“这次我们是借东南风而行”，顺利地驶向长山岛。
    十一日夜，人民解放军在漆黑的海洋中急驶七个钟头，到达长山岛。愚笨的敌人，有的就在睡梦中作了人民解放军的俘虏。十二日晨三时，我军全部登陆，完全解放南北长山岛、大小竹山岛、大小黑山岛，庙岛等七个岛屿。敌人海军的作战布置全被打破，砣矶岛残敌完全裸露在我军火力控制下了。敌匪八艘炮艇，四艘兵舰曾一度妄图反扑，但在我远距离炮火的轰击下逃跑了。“太山号”运输舰和两只汽船，都作了我们的俘虏。
