In his speech, Comrade Dong Biwu, Chairman of the North China People's Government, first pointed out: The Beiping Military Control Commission and the People's Government have learned to manage Beiping City in a democratic way. Many problems that the former reactionary government could not solve, such as clearing garbage, organizing street vendors, sheltering beggars, and reforming petty thieves, have been resolved by the People's Government through democratic methods, consulting with the people, and obtaining the assistance of the people, thus eliminating these obstacles to the development of Beiping's production. He then reported on the production situation in rural North China, explaining that the vast rural areas of North China have weathered the drought in the first half of the year, completed the production plan for the first half of the year, and will have sufficient industrial raw materials and grain to supply the city, ensuring that there will be no problems with the raw materials for urban industrial production. Comrade Dong Biwu said: "Developing urban production, transforming consumer cities into productive cities, supplying rural areas with industrial products, and reducing the burden on farmers are the main keys to improving urban-rural relations. The people of all walks of life in Beiping City must carry forward the spirit of hard struggle to complete the tasks just instructed by Commander-in-Chief Zhu."

Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, said: "We must make the construction of Beiping City the starting point of new democratic construction and a model for the construction of cities across the country." Shen Junru, Standing Director of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, said: "I hope that the representatives of all circles in Beiping will bring the opinions of the people to the representative conference for discussion sincerely and frankly, and do as written on the slogans in the venue: 'Closely link with the masses, adhere to the mass line, and a pragmatic style', in order to unite the people of Beiping and engage in the work of building a new Beiping." Guo Moruo, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, said: "In building Beiping City, we must take the spirit of the Soviet Union in building Moscow as an example. In Beiping's material construction and spiritual construction (that is, cultural and educational construction), we must develop in a three-dimensional way, and build Beiping into a progressive city with factories, schools, museums, cultural palaces, and libraries everywhere."

Zhao Zhensheng, Deputy Secretary of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, put forward the main tasks of Beiping City in the future: 1. Strengthen and consolidate the revolutionary social order, continue to eliminate the sabotage activities of Kuomintang reactionaries and bandits, and take all necessary measures to protect the people and state property. 2. Further restore and develop Beiping's public and private production, and at the same time carry out a thrift campaign. 3. Continue to develop public trade and cooperative undertakings, strengthen the leadership and management of the market, unite upright merchants, and wage a resolute struggle against unscrupulous merchants who speculate, hoard, disrupt the market, and disrupt prices in order to stabilize the lives of the people of Beiping. 4. Strive to restore and develop Beiping's educational undertakings, and strive to cultivate a new generation of young people to become talents for new democratic nation-building. Trade unions should pay attention to strengthening the education of workers, and educational institutions should use all methods to pay attention to solving the education problems of workers' children.

Representatives such as Wu Han, Yuan Zhi, Shi Dehai, Tian Lun, Xu Beihong, Bagen, Yu Yidi, Yu Xinqing, Han Zhuoru, and Zhang Jiantang unanimously stated in their speeches that the people of all walks of life in Beiping City should unite under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, assist the Military Control Commission and the People's Government, and build a new Beiping City, and have firm confidence in transforming Beiping from a consumer city into a production city.

In the afternoon, the meeting continued, chaired by Peng Zhen. First, the entire meeting adopted the agenda, meeting rules, and rules of procedure. Then, Ye Jianying, Director of the Military Control Commission and Mayor of Beiping, gave detailed reports on the military control work and municipal work in Beiping during the six months since its liberation. Then, the establishment of a proposal review committee was approved, and forty-one members were elected. Finally, a temporary motion was passed at the meeting, unanimously approving a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu and a congratulatory telegram to the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference.
