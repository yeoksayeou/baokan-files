The People's Liberation Army has thus liberated Changsha City, the capital of Hunan Province. In order to implement Chairman Mao's and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order to advance and peacefully resolve the Hunan issue, General Lin Biao, Commander of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, dispatched five representatives, Jin Ming, Tang Tianji, Yuan Renzhi, Xie Peiran, and Li Minghao, to Pingjiang on the 22nd of last month to hold negotiations with General Cheng Qian's representatives. General Li Minghao also personally went to Changsha to negotiate with Generals Cheng Qian and Chen Mingren. Generals Cheng and Chen expressed their sincere acceptance of the eight articles and twenty-four clauses of the "Domestic Peace Agreement" negotiated by the CCP delegation and the Nanjing government delegation on April 15. Generals Cheng and Chen then arrested Fu Zhengmo, commander of the bandit Suppression Headquarters of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Border Region, and all the special agents and bandits left in Changsha by the White bandit Chongxi, and led their troops in an uprising in Changsha on the 4th, welcoming the entry of the Liberation Army into the city.
