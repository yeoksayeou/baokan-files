    The District Party Committees and Propaganda Workers
    
    In the first half of this year, the Novosibirsk District held district and municipal party representative conferences. Many delegates emphasized that a significant imbalance had formed in the Novosibirsk Party organization between the growth in the number of party members and the level of political education of party members and probationary members. In its resolution, the representative conference instructed the new organizational bodies of the municipal and district party committees to thoroughly improve the Marxist-Leninist education of party members.
    
    Novosibirsk has a wide network of party education groups and schools. In the urban area this year, there are 128 political schools and more than 300 study groups on the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The city has a Marxist-Leninist night school, attended by nearly 600 leading party and Soviet officials, technicians, doctors, and teachers. In the city's largest industrial area—Kirov District—a Marxist-Leninist branch school was established this year with 95 students. Thousands of communists are self-studying Marxist-Leninist theory; to assist them, the city provides sufficient study rooms, libraries, and Q&A services.
    
    Further improvement of the political education of party members depends primarily on the importance attached to this matter by party organizations at all levels and the selection and quality of work of propaganda personnel.
    
    Let us take the party organization of the Racecourse District as an example. You cannot deny the significant achievements here in improving the quality of party education work. What explains this? First of all, it is because the District Party Committee of the Racecourse District cares about improving the cultural and political standards of propaganda personnel. It carefully selects group leaders. A number of steadfast propaganda cadres have emerged in the district. For example, Comrades Furasov and Kelesnikov led several political schools two years ago. Now they are finishing the study plan of the CPSU history study group, which includes the original audience. Many propaganda personnel, such as Comrades Kolotov, Snetel, and others, have been working for five to ten years. The oldest propaganda worker, Comrade Losin, has been leading political schools and groups for ten years. The number of communists promoted to propaganda work is growing and constantly gaining prestige.
    
    In the Racecourse District, a clear and meticulous work system for propaganda personnel has been established. The District Party Committee implements regular gatherings of propaganda personnel in study classes and periodic experience exchange meetings, thereby comprehensively and deeply studying the valuable experience of propaganda work.
    
    Comrade Chuvalovsky, an excellent propagandist of the Geological Bureau's party organization, is well-known throughout the district. Last year, he led a CPSU history study group, which successfully completed its study plan. Now he is leading a new party history study group. Talks that are substantive but not dry, the use of supplementary materials, and the ability to approach each listener—all these qualities make group leader Comrade Chuvalovsky stand out.
    
    To enable other group leaders to gain practical lessons and understand how to conduct classes, the Racecourse District Party Committee invited groups of propaganda personnel from other enterprises to attend Comrade Chuvalovsky's classes in turn. Many comrades saw how he launched lively, unconstrained conversations among the listeners and how he linked the study of party history with the current situation.
    
    More importantly, the district party committee began to explore more deeply the ideological content of the work of political schools and groups. At the beginning of each month, the propaganda department holds a group inspection plan by the secretary of the district party committee and other staff. Comrade Uchkin, the first secretary of the District Party Committee, often gives political lessons. After the monthly work inspection, the staff of the propaganda department often summon the propaganda personnel and secretaries of the party organizations to talk, exchange opinions, and put forward their own hopes and criticisms.
    
    Propaganda workers are the central figures in the party's education, but many district party committees have forgotten this. The Yezhovsky and Dzerzhinsky districts are very negligent in the work of propaganda personnel. Not only is there a lack of supervision of group work, but even some propaganda personnel have not been approved by the district party committee branch meetings. The same phenomenon also occurs in the Central District, the October District, and other districts.
    
    Let us take Comrade Dulishev, a propagandist in the October District, as an example. He is leading a political group for the first time. Naturally, he should expect the District Party Committee to give him comprehensive assistance. However, the opposite is true. For several months, no staff member of the District Party Committee had given a lecture in the group led by Comrade Dulishev. Comrade Shrobingko, who leads the propaganda department of the October District Party Committee, does not understand how the propaganda personnel are working, how they are studying, and how they are progressing in their practical work. It is no wonder that some leaders of political schools and political groups in the district, who have lost help and supervision, have messed up their work. This cannot but be blamed on the results of the party's education work in the district.
    
    The municipal party committee has now taken new measures to make the district party committees truly focus on the selection, allocation, and education of propaganda cadres, just like the municipal party committee. Each district has begun to regularly set up propaganda personnel study classes. In the propaganda personnel study class in the Central District, the following lectures were given: on the theory of the party's ideology, organization, and policies, on the fourth chapter of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on Comrade Stalin's Marxism and the colonial question, and on the situation in the new democratic countries.
    
    Now, not only the staff of the propaganda department, but also the secretaries of the district party committees have begun to regularly participate in lectures at political schools and groups, talk with listeners, and supervise the work of propaganda personnel.
    
    The district and municipal party committees have begun to systematically listen to the work reports of secretaries and propaganda personnel of party organizations and organs at all levels at branch meetings. At the end of May, the municipal party committee branch listened to reports from leaders of CPSU history study groups: Comrade Goretnov of the "Plastmass Factory," Comrade Zhukov of the Tomsk Railway Freight Transfer Bureau, and Comrade Gusevaya of the Kuznetsk District Mining Design Office. In addition to propaganda personnel, the municipal party committee branch also invited some secretaries of party organizations to participate. After the propaganda personnel reported, the staff of the municipal party committee's propaganda department, who had carefully inspected the group work, participated in the lectures, and talked with the listeners, also spoke at the branch meeting. A comprehensive discussion of this issue proved that there were still serious shortcomings in the work of the group: the listeners had not mastered the material well, and the district party committee and branch had not given the propaganda personnel adequate assistance. The municipal party committee branch instructed the Kaganovich and Central District Party Committees to explore the content of the group work more deeply, transform the work of the study classes, and regularly listen to the work reports of propaganda personnel at meetings. The study plans of the party education groups and schools are coming to an end. At the same time, the districts of the city are beginning preparations for the next school year. Therefore, it is now appropriate to prevent the recurrence of last year's mistakes, and it is correct to consider the importance of expanding political schools and groups based on universal education and political level. To this end, the municipal party committee recommends that party organizations at all levels expand the work of political schools and groups, which must be attended by propaganda personnel selected by the leaders of each group and political school.
    
    The municipal party committee branch decided to set up advanced training classes for propaganda personnel in the summer. In June-July 1948, short-term training classes and... the attached research classes were designated to provide advanced training for more than 200 leaders of CPSU history study groups and political schools.
    
    It is very important to make the leading staff of the party itself become propaganda workers to lead schools and groups. This is a group of trained people. Moreover, if they can actively participate in propaganda work, we guarantee that the party's education will reach a higher level. (Translated from Pravda "Party Life")

    区党委和宣传工作者

    今年前半年新西比尔斯克区曾举行了区和市的党代表会议。很多代表们都着重地提出，在新西比尔斯克党的组织中形成了党员数量的增长与党员、候补党员的政治教育水平间显著的不协调的现象。代表会议在决议中指示市委和区党委的新组织机构应彻底改进党员的马列主义教育。
    在新西比尔斯克有着宽广的党的教育小组及学校网。在市区本年有一二八所政校和三百多个联共党史学习小组。市内设有马列夜校，将近六百个党和苏维埃的领导工作者、技师、大夫和教师参加夜校学习。在该市最大工业区—基洛辅，本年设立了马列分校，该校有学员九十五人，成千的共产党员自动地学习着马列主义理论；为了帮助他们学习，市内设有足够的学习室、图书馆和解答问题处。
    进一步地改善党员的政治教育，首先有赖于各级党的组织对这件事情的重视及宣传人员的选拔及其工作质量。
    我们拿赛马场区党的组织作例子。你不能不承认这里在改善党的教育工作质量上的显著的成就。用什么来说明这个问题呢？首先就是因为赛马场的区党委关心着宣传人员的文化政治水准的提高。它很慎重地选拔小组长。该区出现了不少坚毅不拔的宣传干部。譬如福拉索夫同志，喀列斯诺夫同志两年前曾领导着好几个政校。现在他们正在结束包括原有听众的联共党史小组的学习计划。有很多宣传人员，在客洛托夫同志，斯涅特尔同志以及其他同志都已工作五年到十年了。最老的宣传工作者洛辛同志十年来都从事领导政校及小组的工作。被提拔到宣传工作岗位上的共产党员在增长着，并不断地赢得威望。
    在赛马场区，明确周密的宣传人员的工作制度已经制定。区党委实行着研究班宣传人员的正常集会和定期交流经验的会议，借此来全面而深刻地研究宣传工作的宝贵经验。
    地质局党组织的优秀宣传者楚法洛夫斯基同志是闻名全区的。去年他领导一个联共党史学习小组，该组胜利地完成了学习计划。现在他又领导着一个新的党史学习小组。有内容而不苦燥的谈话，补充材料的运用以及善于接近每一个听众——这一切品质使小组领导者楚法洛夫斯基同志出人一头。
    为了使其他小组领导者能够得到实际教训，了解应该如何进行教课，赛马场区党委邀请了其他企业部门的宣传人员小组轮流参加楚法洛夫斯基小组听课。不少同志都看到，他如何在听众之间展开生动的、不拘束的谈话，如何将党史的学习与当前时势联系起来。
    更重要的是该地区党委开始更深入地探究政校及小组工作的思想内容。在宣传部门每逢月初由区党委书记及其他工作人员举行一次小组检查计划。该区区党委正书记乌赤庚同志经常上政治课。在每月工作检查以后，宣传部门的工作人员常召唤党组织的宣传人员及书记谈话，交换意见，提出自己的希望及批评的意见。
    宣传工作者——是党的教育底中心人物，然而不少的区党委却忘记了这点。热耶希夫斯基及捷尔任斯基区，对宣传人员的工作很疏忽。不仅对小组工作缺乏监督，甚而一部分宣传人员未得到区党委支部会议的批准。同样的现象亦发生在中央区，十月区以及别的地区。
    我们拿十月区宣传员杜里舍夫同志作例子。第一次作一个政治小组的领导者。理所当然地他应该期待区党委对他的全面帮助。然而事实却不然。好几个月期间区党委的任何工作人员都没有到杜里舍夫同志所领导的小组里去讲过课。领导十月区党委宣传部门的施若宾科同志就不了解：宣传人员们都工作得怎么样，他们学习如何以及他们在实际工作中的进展如何。这就无怪乎该区政校及政治小组某些失掉帮助与监督的领导者将工作做得一团糟了。这不能不归罪于该区党的教育工作的结果。
    市委现在采取了新措施，使得各区党委将宣传干部的选拔，配备及教育工作，象市委一样的，真正作为注意的重点。各区都开始正规地设置了宣传人员研究班。在中央区宣传人员研究班里曾进行如下的讲座：关于党的思想、组织及政策的理论，关于联共党史第四章，关于斯大林同志马克思主义及殖民地问题，以及关于新民主主义国家的情况。
    现在不仅是宣传部门的工作人员，连区党委的书记们亦都开始经常地，参加政校及小组的讲课，和听众交谈，并督促宣传人员的工作。
    区党委和市委开始有计划地听取各级党组织及机关的书记及宣传人员在支部会上的工作报告。五月底市委支部在会议上听取了联共党史学习小组的领导者的报告：有“普拉思特马思工厂高列特诺夫同志的，顿木斯克铁路货物转运局朱科夫同志的和古斯涅赤区采矿设计处—古谢娃雅同志的。市委支部会除了宣传人员外还邀请了一些党组织的书记参加。宣传人员报告以后，曾经慎密检查了小组工作，参加讲课并和听众交谈过的市委宣传部的工作人员亦曾在支部会上发表讲话。这个问题的全面地讨论证明了小组工作中尚存在着严重的缺点：讲过的材料听众未能很好地掌握，区党委和支部方面亦没有给与宣传人员适当的帮助。市委支部责成喀干诺维赤和中央区党委更深入一步地探究小组工作的内容，改造研究班的工作及定期在会议上听取宣传人员的工作报告。党的教育小组及学校的学习计划正正结束。同时该市各区正开始下学年的准备工作。因此，目前宜预防去年错误的重犯，并正确地，要考虑到普及教育及政治水平，扩充政校及小组是十分重要的。为此市委建议各级党的组织进行政校及小组的扩充工作，这些小组及政校是各该小组及政校的领导者所选拔出的宣传人员所必须参加的。
    市委支部决定夏季设置宣传人员的深造训练班。在一九四八年六月——七月间短期训练班和………附设的研究班指定要深造二百多名联共党史学习小组及政校的领导人材。
    使党的领导工作人员本身成为宣传工作者去领导学校和小组，是十分重要的。这是一批有锻炼的人。而且，假使他们能够积极地参加宣传工作，我们担保党的教育会达到较高的水平的。（译自真理报“党的生活”）
