The Transformation of the Qinghe Woolen Mill Cooperative

During the enemy-puppet period, the Qinghe Woolen Mill also had a "cooperative," which belonged to the puppet United Logistics Welfare Section. Its establishment was not to reduce intermediate exploitation and seek convenience for members' consumption or to supply members' needs. It only "rationed" a little something, trying to trick the workers with a small benefit. The treatment of members was also unequal; the higher the position, the more they received in rations.

The liberation of Qinghe came before the liberation of the urban area of Beiping. At that time, the source of goods was not smooth, and the workers felt a lack of staple food. The factory administration allocated 53,000 catties of millet as capital, and sent people to Nankou, Zhangjiakou and other places to buy a batch of food and meat. Together with some surplus materials from the old cooperative, they started the cooperative. At the same time, workers were encouraged to buy shares, and the cooperative was still led and managed by the administrative welfare section. The staff was also assigned by the administration (their salaries and the cooperative's stationery were paid by the cooperative). The cooperative also did business with non-members, and sometimes the prices were even higher than the market price in Qinghe, because they were afraid of losing money.

Because the business hours were not properly set, the prices were sometimes higher than the market price, and the staff did not follow the mass line and were not friendly enough, workers were generally dissatisfied with the cooperative. Some wrote articles criticizing it in the staff newspaper, some grumbled behind their backs, and the vast majority of people were indifferent to the cooperative, feeling that the cooperative was just a store opened by the factory and were simply unwilling to buy things from the cooperative. These phenomena did not attract the factory's timely attention. The trade union initially had this idea: it is true that the cooperative was not well run and the workers were generally dissatisfied; but the cooperative was led by the administration, and the vast majority of the funds were from the administration, and the workers' shares were very small. They thought that apart from making suggestions to the administration, the trade union had no right to interfere, so the situation became more and more serious.

In mid-May, the labor protection department of the trade union launched a "Cooperative Management Committee" composed of five people to assist the cooperative in rectifying its business. At the same time, people were sent to the Municipal Cooperative Federation to ask for instructions on how to run the cooperative. The Federation immediately sent people to assist, first to unify thinking from all aspects, and clearly pointed out that the cooperative is an economic organization of the workers, and the administration has the obligation to support it economically, and should let the workers run it themselves. In early June, the administration decided to hand over the cooperative to the trade union for leadership. Under the guidance of the Municipal Federation, the "Cooperative Management Committee" was changed to the "Cooperative Preparatory Committee." Through the trade union groups, workers were mobilized to give their opinions on the cooperative, and the work of reorganizing the cooperative was carried out, ending the original cooperative's business. A draft of the cooperative's articles of association was drafted and distributed to each group for discussion, and the election of members' representatives and cooperative affairs committee members was brewed. The business hours were also set according to the workers' opinions. At the same time, several appropriate adjustments were made in terms of personnel, and people who could be competent were found among the workers and detached from production to specialize in cooperative business.

The reorganized cooperative started business on June 29. It stopped doing business with non-members and established new sales procedures. Grain, cloth, oil, salt, alkali and other major items must be purchased with a member card. Purchases are registered and paid for first, and then goods are collected with a sales voucher. The price of things is generally lower than the market price, but it is adjusted appropriately according to the market rise and fall trend (according to the price on the newspaper the day before plus freight) (those who participate in adjusting the price are the preparatory committee, the director of the trade union and the cooperative's business personnel during the preparatory period; after the establishment of the cooperative affairs committee, the standing committee and the business personnel adjust the price). On July 21, the first meeting of members' representatives was held, the articles of association were approved, and eleven members of the cooperative affairs committee were democratically elected (five of whom were standing committee members), and the cooperative affairs committee was officially established. Currently, the cooperative has 1,135 shares, each share costing seven catties of corn. Together with the administrative loans and public accumulation funds (i.e., the surplus of the original cooperative), the total capital is 60,000 catties of millet, and it can also borrow from the administration at any time if necessary. In order to facilitate the needs of workers, the cooperative opened a staff canteen this month, where staff can eat meals on credit and pay in kind at the end of the month. It is also planning to handle staff in-kind storage. The business operation is also constantly seeking improvement. Considering that in the past two months, the people buying things were crowded after two or three days after the salary was paid, especially when registering for grain purchase, because the workers worked in day and night shifts, the staff who handled the registration often stayed up all night. The members' representatives immediately met to discuss and launched a collective purchase method. Members first register what they want to buy in each department and pay the money. Then each department combines the money and hands it over to the cooperative, and then receives the things from the cooperative. The members' covenant was also unanimously approved, prohibiting the transfer of member cards to others. Those who violate it will be announced at the first meeting and asked to confess. The purchase right will be suspended for three months for the second time. Basically, the staff has realized that the current cooperative is serving the members.

The current cooperative is closely connected with the masses and can pay attention to the masses' feedback in a timely manner and consult with the masses at any time when problems arise. This is a good aspect. On the other hand, there are still many things that need to be improved urgently, such as the work system has not been well established, the internal work lacks planning, and things are often piled up, busy for a while. Sometimes, due to inadequate prior consideration, reckless decisions are made temporarily, causing losses to the cooperative. Secondly, the staff should strengthen their business study. The current phenomenon of spontaneous learning must be quickly corrected. Third, members generally only want the cooperative's things to be priced as low as possible. When they encounter buying cheap things, some even lend their member cards to others to buy because they have no money to buy themselves. Some workers said: "It doesn't matter if the cooperative loses money, as long as every member gets benefits." If this continues, there will be a risk of losing all the funds. For example, last time when the salary was paid, the price was not adjusted in time for one day, and it lost more than 300,000 yuan, equivalent to more than 3,000 catties of millet. This bias must be corrected in time so that the cooperative's business can be consolidated. Based on the above situation, on the one hand, the trade union should strengthen its leadership over the cooperative and conduct education for members at any time in coordination with propaganda work; at the same time, the Municipal Cooperative Federation must greatly strengthen its contact with the cooperative and its guidance and inspection in business.

### 清河制呢厂合作社的改造

　　清河制呢厂合作社的改造
    在敌伪时期，清河制呢厂也有“合作社”，它是属于伪联勤福利科的。它的设立不是为减少中间剥削并谋社员消费之便利与供应社员需要，只是“配售”一点点东西，是想借一杯羹便利之赐，来骗骗工人的。社员待遇也不平等，职位愈高的配售的东西就愈多。
    清河的解放在北平城区解放之先。当时货物来源不畅，职工主食感到缺乏，厂行政方面拨出五万三千斤小米做资金，派人到南口、张家口一带买了一批食粮和肉类，加上旧合作社一部分剩余物资，把合作社开办起来。同时吸收工人入股，仍由行政福利科领导经营，工作人员也是由行政派定的（他们的薪资和社里文具用品由社方开支）。合作社兼做非社员买卖，因为怕亏了本，物价有时比清河的市价还高。
    由于营业时间定得不恰当，物价有时又比市价还高，工作人员不走群众路线，态度不够和气，引起工人普遍对合作社不满。有的在职工报上写文章批评，有的在背后发牢骚，绝大多数人对合作社漠不关心，觉得合作社就等于厂方开的一个商店，根本就不乐意到合作社来买东西；这些现象，并未引起厂方及时注意，职工会起初也存在着这样的思想：合作社办得不好，工人普遍不满，这是事实；但合作社是由行政领导的，资金的绝大部分是行政的，职工的股金为数极微，以为除了向行政建议，职工会没权加以干涉。以致情形愈来愈严重。
    五月中，职工会劳保部推出五人组成一个“合作社管理委员会”协助合作社整顿业务。同时派人去市合作总社请示办理合作社的方法，总社随即派人来协助，首先从各方面打通思想，明确指出合作社是职工的经济组织，行政有义务在经济方面加以扶持，应放手让职工自己办。六月初，行政决定将合作社交给职工会领导来办，在市总社的指导下，将“合作社管理委员会”改为“合作社筹备委员会”，通过工会小组，发动工人对合作社提意见，进行社务改组工作，结束原合作社业务，拟定社章草案发给各组讨论，酝酿选举社员代表及社务委员，并听从工人意见，定出营业时间，同时在人事方面作了几次适当的调整，在工人群众中找出能胜任的人，脱离生产，专搞合作社业务。
    改组后的合作社于六月二十九日开始营业。停止了非社员买卖，建立新的售货手续。粮、布、油、盐、碱等主要物品，要凭社员证购买。购物先登记缴款，凭售货券取物，东西价格一般都比市价低，但随市场涨落趋势（按前一天报纸上的牌价加上运费）作适当的调整（参加调整物价的，在筹备期间是筹备委员会同职工会主任及合作社营业人员；社务委员会成立后由常委及营业人员调整）。七月二十一日召开了第一次社员代表大会，通过了社章，民主选出社委十一人（其中五人为常委），正式成立社务委员会。现该社共有股份一一三五股，每股股金玉米七斤，连同行政上的借款及公积金（即原合作社的盈余），共有资金六万斤小米，必要时还可随时向行政借支。为便利职工需要，本月份起该社开办了一个职工食堂，职工可赊吃客饭，到月底折实付款；又在计划办理职工实物储存。业务经营方面也在不断的求改进，因鉴于近两月来，每到发薪之后的两三天内，买东西的人挤得水泄不通，特别是登记购粮的时候，因为工人工作分日夜班，办理登记的人员，往往忙得通宵不睡，社员代表随即开会商量，发动集体购买的办法。社员先在各部门登记要买的东西，并缴款，然后由各该部把款总起来交与合作社，再向合作社领取东西。又一致通过了社员公约，不准将社员证转借他人，违反的，第一次开会宣布，并要他坦白，第二次停止三个月的购买权。基本上，已使职工认识到现在的合作社是为社员服务的了。
    目前的合作社，与群众联系得很紧，能及时注意群众的反映，出了问题随时找群众商量，这是好的一方面。另方面，也还存在许多急待改进的地方，象工作制度还没有好好建立起来，内部工作缺乏计划，事情往往堆在一起，穷忙一阵。有的时候因事先考虑不周，临时作冒然决定，使合作社受损失。其次，工作人员应该加强业务学习，目前这种学习自流的现象，必须迅速纠正。三，社员一般只愿合作社的东西价钱定得愈低愈好，遇到买便宜东西时，甚致有自己没钱买的，把社员证借给别人去买，有些工友说：“合作社赔钱没关系，只要每个社员都得到了利益。”如果长此下去，资金就会有赔光的危险。象上次发薪时，一天未及时调整价格，就亏了三十多万元，折合小米三千多斤，这种偏向，必须及时加以纠正，合作社的业务才能巩固。综合以上情况，一方面职工会应加强对合作社的领导，配合着宣教工作，随时对社员进行教育；同时，市合作总社对于该社的联系及业务方面的指导和检查等工作，还须大大加强才好。
