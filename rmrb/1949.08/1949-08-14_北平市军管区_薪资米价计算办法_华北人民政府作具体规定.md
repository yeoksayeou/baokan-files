    Beiping Military Control District
    Salary and Rice Price Calculation Method
    Specific Regulations Made by the North China People's Government
    [This newspaper dispatch] The North China People's Government has recently issued a notice stipulating the salary and wage rice price calculation method for the Beiping Military Control District, which will be implemented from August. The method is as follows: (1) Salaries and wages will be paid twice a month, and their rice prices will be calculated on the 14th and 28th respectively. (2) Calculation method: The rice price for the first half of the month is calculated based on the Beiping market price in the "Local Market Conditions" column of the People's Daily on the 14th, that is, 70% of the price of millet (average of wholesale and retail prices) plus 30% of the price of millet (average of wholesale and retail prices). When calculating, the average price is calculated to two decimal places, and the final rice price is determined with an integer yuan as the minimum unit, and decimals below the yuan are rounded off. The rice price for the second half of the month is calculated based on the materials in the People's Daily on the 28th, according to the calculation method for the first half of the month. (3) After the salary rice price is calculated, there are three days for salary payment, that is, to the 17th for the first half of the month and to the 31st for the second half of the month (or the 1st of the following month for small months). If on the last day of salary payment, the market price calculated according to the prescribed method exceeds 20% of the original planned rice price, the excess part will be converted into rice at the original calculated rice price, and the government will notify the re-issuance of the converted amount at the then-calculated rice price during the next salary payment. (4) In case of Saturday afternoon, Sunday, and holidays during salary payment, the accounting and cashier departments of various agencies and factories shall still work as usual to pay salaries and shall not be delayed. (5) Those who implement the supply system on a contract basis shall also implement the rice price accordingly.
