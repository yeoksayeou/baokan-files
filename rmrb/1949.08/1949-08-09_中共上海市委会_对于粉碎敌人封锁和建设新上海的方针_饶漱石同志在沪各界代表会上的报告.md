Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 8th: Rao Shushi, Secretary of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, reported on the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee's policy on crushing the enemy blockade and building a new Shanghai at the Shanghai Municipal People's Representatives Conference on the 3rd of this month. The report received unanimous support from the entire audience. The full text of the report is as follows:

Fellow representatives! Comrades!

Today, the Shanghai Municipal People's Representatives Conference opens. On behalf of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, I will report to all representatives at this meeting on our Party's policy regarding crushing the enemy blockade and building a new Shanghai. I request that all representatives study, discuss, examine, and correct it.

The Liberation Daily published an editorial on July 27th entitled "Crush the Enemy Blockade and Struggle to Build a New Shanghai." This editorial is the future work policy of our Party's Shanghai Municipal Committee, and also the future work policy of our Party's East China Bureau.

Long before the liberation of Shanghai, we pointed out that the liberation of Shanghai is not only a victory for the entire Chinese people, but also a victory for the people of the world. At the same time, it was pointed out that the liberation of Shanghai would inevitably bring some new and serious difficulties. Why does the liberation of Shanghai have such great significance? Because Shanghai has been the largest and strongest fortress of imperialism's aggression and enslavement of the Chinese people for more than a century; it has been the main base for the Kuomintang reactionaries' rule and exploitation of the Chinese people for more than 20 years. Therefore, the liberation of Shanghai is the bankruptcy of the imperialist forces of aggression in China; it is the demise of the reactionary Kuomintang rule. Therefore, the liberation of Shanghai is something that the entire world, except for the imperialists and reactionaries of various countries, cannot but rejoice over. Why does the liberation of Shanghai simultaneously bring some new and serious difficulties? Precisely because Shanghai is the largest city in China and Asia, and the so-called "prosperity" of this city in the past was not built on an independent and sound economic foundation, but on the basis of the combination of imperialism, comprador, and bureaucratic capital. Therefore, to transform the old Shanghai, where imperialism, compradors, and bureaucratic officials exploited and oppressed the Chinese people, into a new Shanghai that is truly independent, self-reliant, and does not depend on foreign imperialism, will inevitably encounter many temporary difficulties. For example, those industries that originally relied on imperialist raw materials and fuels cannot but suffer temporary difficulties; another example is that those industries and businesses that produced for the enjoyment of imperialist compradores, bureaucrats, landlords, and warlords in the past must change their production policies in the future, and cannot but suffer temporary difficulties; and again, those enterprises that belonged to the Kuomintang and bureaucratic capital in the past must be transformed after we take them over, and cannot but have certain temporary difficulties. Because among the six million people in Shanghai, the population that actually directly and indirectly participates in production is only three million, and the non-productive population reaches as many as three million; it is a complex and arduous task to turn such a large number of consumers into producers, or to disperse them back to their hometowns for production. But we clearly know that the above-mentioned difficulties are all difficulties in victory and development, and can be completely overcome. Therefore, we are not discouraged or wavered in our determination to liberate Shanghai because of the above-mentioned difficulties; on the contrary, we are not afraid of these difficulties and are prepared to overcome them.

Our policy for building a new Shanghai is to transform the old Shanghai, where imperialism, compradors, and bureaucrats exploited and oppressed the Chinese people, into a new Shanghai that serves domestic production and the Chinese people; it is to transform the old Shanghai, which was abnormally developed in the past, into a truly healthy and prosperous new Shanghai. But to complete this great transformation, Shanghai must break away from its dependence on the imperialist economy. We know that to transform the old Shanghai, which relied entirely on the imperialist economy for its survival and development in the past, into a new Shanghai that is completely independent, self-reliant, and does not depend on the imperialist economy, is not an easy task; it is an extremely complex and arduous task, and it must go through a temporary superficial process of "retreat" and "contraction." This is just like a patient who undergoes surgery for appendicitis or other serious ailments must go through a temporary "weight loss" before he can return to normal health after the ailment is completely removed. Precisely because we know that transforming the old Shanghai, which was a morbid and bloated state in the past, into a healthy and prosperous new Shanghai requires a temporary and superficial hard process of "retreat" and "contraction," so at the beginning of Shanghai's liberation, we adopted many prudent and cautious transitional measures, which we still continue to adopt, such as a broad foreign trade policy and an encouragement policy for overseas transportation, such as tax exemption for cotton imports and rewards for certain import and export goods, etc., in an attempt to avoid excessive fluctuations, in order to gradually transform and wait for the improvement of the masses' awareness. However, the imperialists and their running dogs, the remnant forces of the Kuomintang, not only did not change their policy of aggression against China and their destructive conspiracy to be enemies of the Chinese people because of the leniency of the People's Government and their own military and political defeat; on the contrary, the imperialists are directing their running dogs, the remnant forces of the Kuomintang, to continuously bomb and strafe our peaceful residents of Shanghai, and to carry out armed blockades against Shanghai and our coastal ports. They attempt to use these barbaric methods to prevent our internal and external transportation, cut off our supply of coal, grain, and industrial raw materials, to destroy our Shanghai's production and construction, and to force us to surrender to imperialism.

We can predict that the imperialists are now directing the remnant forces of the Kuomintang to attempt to use bombing, strafing, and armed blockades to deepen our economic difficulties and force us to surrender. These attempts, like the various conspiracies they have used in the past to harm us, will surely be completely bankrupt! Three years ago, American imperialists directed the reactionary Kuomintang to launch a reactionary civil war against the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people, attempting to drown the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people together in the bloody sea of civil war. But the result was not the failure of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, but the failure of American imperialism itself, and the demise of its running dog, the reactionary Kuomintang.

The imperialists direct the remnant forces of the Kuomintang to bomb and strafe the people of Shanghai and carry out armed blockades against the Chinese people, which cannot shake the Chinese people's determination to completely expel the imperialist forces of aggression from China and completely eliminate the remnant reactionary forces of the Kuomintang, and cannot shake the great Chinese people's optimism about a bright future. We call on all Shanghai workers, students, suburban peasants, all working masses, all progressive cultural circles, industrial circles, and all patriotic democrats to unite together to crush the enemy's bombing and blockade, and to build a healthy and prosperous new Shanghai, and resolutely implement the following tasks:

1. Actively support the People's Liberation Army in its southward campaign, quickly liberate Fujian and Taiwan, and cooperate with the liberation of all other unliberated areas throughout the country. This is the most effective way to respond to enemy aircraft bombing and strafing and to crush the armed blockade of Shanghai and our coastal ports by imperialism and the remnant forces of the Kuomintang. The People's Liberation Army's field armies are currently carrying out a great march to the southern and northwestern provinces, the likes of which have never been seen in history. We must do everything possible to support the People's Liberation Army in quickly liberating all of China! We must do everything possible to support the rear guard troops, consolidate the rear, and resolutely eliminate lurking special agents and bandits! We must understand that after the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist. They will inevitably use various methods to fight us to the death. If we despise these enemies, we will make a very big mistake. (⑴⑵)

2. Implement the evacuation of personnel and the relocation of some schools and factories to the interior in a planned and step-by-step manner. First of all, a large number of refugees and unemployed masses should be mobilized to return to their hometowns for production and to reclaim land for production in the Huangfan area of northern Anhui and the salt reclamation area of northern Jiangsu. Also, all landlords who have fled and landlords, rich peasants, farmers, and young people who have been deceived by the enemy to come to Shanghai should be persuaded to immediately return to their original hometowns to participate in production; even if some of them are landlords and rich peasants who have oppressed the peasants, as long as they can correct their mistakes and return home to produce, the local government and people will be able to deal with them leniently. In addition, certain schools and factories should be encouraged to relocate to the interior under possible and necessary conditions in order to obtain food, coal, and raw materials, to change the current crowded situation in Shanghai, and to reduce the burden on the city. However, the relocation of factories is a complex and arduous task. This must not only be done in accordance with the principle of voluntary participation by each factory, but also with full and thorough planning and preparation; otherwise, it may cause losses and increase difficulties. We adopt a strict protection policy for schools and cultural and educational institutions, but all national education plans (university education, various specialized education, secondary education, primary education, and adult literacy education) must meet the needs of the current revolutionary situation and revolutionary tasks. The same should be true for cultural, artistic, and journalistic work.

3. Change the future production policy and development direction of Shanghai. Whether state-owned or private enterprises, they should try to get rid of their dependence on the imperialist economy, and should take serving domestic production and the Chinese people as the future policy and direction of development for all enterprises in Shanghai (for example, mass production of machines needed by various cities and mines in the country, and agricultural tools, fertilizers, cloth, etc. needed by various rural areas). Because only when the economic development of various cities in the country and the agricultural productivity are improved can the industrial production base of Shanghai be guaranteed, can it be self-reliant, and can it get rid of its dependence on imperialism. At the same time, state-owned enterprises that continue to produce in Shanghai must streamline their organizations, improve efficiency, conscientiously achieve enterprise management, and democratize management, and the two must be well combined. The policy of "giving consideration to both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital" must be implemented for private enterprises. Special attention must be paid to correctly handling labor-capital relations. We must do a good job in trade union work. We must educate and unite all workers and other laborers, take care of their interests, care about their lives, and improve their political awareness and cultural level; but on the other hand, we must prevent left-leaning sentiments and biases, and all demands must not only conform to the general production and living standards of society, but also take into account the specific conditions of each factory. In addition to cracking down on speculators and profiteers and any violations of government laws and regulations, we should adopt a firm protection policy for private capitalists. We welcome them to invest in various production undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. During the entire period of the New Democracy, the free bourgeoisie engaged in production undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood are our friends, and we must unite with them and work together to overcome the current difficulties, and learn from them the knowledge of business production and factory management. Our city work policy is still to follow Chairman Mao's principles of "developing production, prospering the economy, giving consideration to both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital" to correctly guide labor-capital relations, public-private relations, urban-rural relations, and internal and external relations.

4. Mobilize a large number of Communist Party members, cadres, workers, and students to go to the countryside to carry out rural work. A large number of workers, students, party members, and cadres must be mobilized to work in the countryside, mobilize the broad masses of peasants to eliminate bandits, transform the regime, develop production, overcome disasters, and carry out land reform systematically and step-by-step, so that the peasants can be completely liberated from feudal oppression and exploitation. This is a task of paramount importance for the entire East China Party and the entire East China people. Because only when the lives of the broad masses of peasants are improved and agricultural production is increased can the market necessary for industrial products be expanded on the one hand, and more grain and industrial raw materials be supplied to the cities on the other hand. Because only by relying on the vast domestic market and the vast countryside to supply enough grain and raw materials can Shanghai and the cities of Jiangnan truly embark on a healthy and prosperous development path. In the past, because our cadres first concentrated on city takeover work and the People's Liberation Army continued to advance fiercely to pursue and annihilate the enemy, and there was no time to strengthen rural work, the two levels of government in the rural areas of Jiangnan are still largely controlled by landlords, rich peasants, and old Baojia chiefs. They collude with bandits and the remnant forces of Kuomintang agents to oppress the people and disrupt social order. We must concentrate our efforts to carry out rural work and overcome the above-mentioned serious phenomena that currently exist in the rural areas of Jiangnan. In the suburbs of Shanghai, we should especially intensify the rush repairs of coastal and embankment projects and disaster relief work.

5. Develop inland transportation and encourage the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. Imperialists are directing the remnant forces of the Kuomintang to use blockade methods to prevent and cut off our internal and external exchange relations. In order to crush the enemy's blockade conspiracy, we must quickly develop inland transportation, work hard to build railways and highways, improve inland river shipping, organize various cooperatives, encourage the exchange of materials between inland areas, and strengthen mutual assistance between urban and rural areas to develop and prosper the domestic economy.

6. Practice thrift and overcome current difficulties. All Party, government, military, and civilian organizations must strictly streamline their agencies, tighten their staffing, clear up materials, establish systems, save expenses, oppose waste, promote a hard and simple work style, and overcome the habit of extravagance and luxury. In particular, our Party and army cadres must use their own exemplary actions and arduous and indomitable spirit to influence and promote the people of Shanghai and East China to carry out the movement to practice thrift and overcome the current difficulties. However, the purpose of our streamlining and saving is to strengthen work efficiency in order to develop production and overcome current living difficulties. Therefore, all agencies and personnel that should be cut must be resolutely streamlined; but all necessary production and work agencies must be strengthened. All expenses that can and should be saved must be saved; but the supply of work needs and minimum expenses must be guaranteed. The laid-off personnel must be properly handled and cannot be left unattended after being laid off. In short, everything should start from the needs of production and work, and must be planned for the long term.

Here we would also like to take the opportunity to state that we will never change our policy towards all foreigners because the imperialists are directing the remnant forces of the Kuomintang to carry out strafing and blockades against us. We will still resolutely implement the policy towards all foreigners stipulated by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in the Eight Articles of Agreement, that is, those who abide by the law and engage in business will be given effective protection, those who violate the law will be given due punishment, and those who are willing to correct their mistakes after committing a crime will be given lenient treatment.

Fellow representatives! Comrades! These are our Party's policies for crushing the enemy blockade, and they are also our Party's policies for building a new Shanghai. If you do not object, let us all unite closely, work together, and strive to crush the enemy's blockade and build a new Shanghai.

Shanghai workers and Shanghai youth students have a long and glorious revolutionary tradition and have made extremely great contributions to the Chinese revolution in the past. Shanghai workers, students, suburban peasants, all working masses, and progressive cultural circles, industrial circles, and patriotic democrats gave us great encouragement and cooperation in protecting factories and schools and other various struggles before the liberation of Shanghai; after the liberation of Shanghai, they cooperated closely with us in the takeover work, in opposing imperialist provocations, and in opposing the sabotage of Kuomintang lurking elements, and gave us great help. I can say that without their cooperation and assistance, it would not have been possible for us to achieve today's achievements and victory. We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to the Shanghai workers, students, suburban peasants, progressive cultural circles, industrial circles, and other Shanghai people for the trust and support they have shown to our Party in the past; we warmly welcome the Shanghai workers, students, suburban peasants, progressive cultural circles, industrial circles, and all patriotic democrats to continue our close cooperation in the future struggle against the enemy's blockade and the construction of a new Shanghai.

Fellow representatives! Comrades! In our struggle to crush the enemy's blockade and build a new Shanghai, we are not isolated. The working people of the world and the people of the whole of China are with us. All Shanghai workers, students, suburban peasants, all working masses, all progressive cultural circles, industrial circles, and all patriotic democrats are united firmly under the program of crushing the enemy's blockade and building a new Shanghai. We have the experience of self-reliance and crushing the enemy's blockade during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, and we can learn from the experience of the Soviet Union after the October Revolution, which defeated the interference and blockade of fourteen countries and built a strong, prosperous, and happy socialist country. We have the leadership of the great leader of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. He led the Chinese working class and the Chinese people through decades of arduous struggle, overcame difficulties that were incomparably greater than the present, and achieved such a great victory today. Therefore, we will definitely be able to overcome our current difficulties and strive for the victory of building a new Shanghai!

Today's temporary conference of representatives from all walks of life is very meaningful. This conference will prepare the conditions and foundation for the formal Shanghai People's Congress to be elected by universal suffrage in the future. This kind of conference of representatives from all walks of life is not only convenient for conveying the Party's policies and the People's Government's policies to the broad masses of people, so that they become the actions of the masses, but also convenient for reflecting the people's opinions to the Communist Party and the People's Government, so that they become the basis of the Communist Party's policies and the People's Government's laws and regulations. I suggest that this kind of conference of representatives from all walks of life should be held more often and more frequently in the future in order to ensure the close connection between the People's Government and the people.

    中共上海市委会
    对于粉碎敌人封锁和建设新上海的方针
    饶漱石同志在沪各界代表会上的报告
    【新华社上海八日电】本月三日，中共中央华东局书记兼中共上海市委会书记饶漱石，在上海市各界代表会议上，报告中共上海市委会对于粉碎敌人封锁和建设新上海的方针。这个报告，得到全场一致的拥护。报告全文如下：
    诸位代表先生们！同志们！
    今天上海各界代表会议开幕，我代表中国共产党上海市委员会，在这次会议上将我党对于粉碎敌人封锁与建设新上海的方针，向各位代表作报告，并请求各代表研究，讨论，审查，指正。
    解放日报在上月二十七日发表了一篇社论，题目是“粉碎敌人封锁，为建设新上海而斗争”。这篇社论便是我党上海市委会今后的工作方针，同时也是我党华东局今后的工作方针。
    远在上海解放之前，我们就指出：上海的解放不仅是全中国人民的胜利，而且也是全世界人民的胜利。同时指出：上海的解放必将带来一些新的严重的困难。为什么上海的解放有如此重大的意义呢？因为上海是帝国主义百余年来侵略与奴役中国人民的最大而最坚强的堡垒；是国民党反动派二十余年来统治和压榨中国人民的主要基地。所以上海的解放，是帝国主义在华侵略势力的破产；是国民党反动统治的灭亡。所以上海的解放，整个世界，除了帝国主义者和各国反动派以外没有不欢欣鼓舞的。为什么上海的解放，会同时带来一些新的严重的困难呢？因为正由于上海是帝国主义侵略与奴役中国人民的最大最强的堡垒，是国民党统治压榨中国人民的主要基地，所以他们对于上海的失败，决不会甘心，他们还要用各种可能的办法来反对上海人民和中国人民。因为上海是全中国、全亚洲最大的城市，而这个城市过去的所谓“繁荣”，不是建立在独立自主的健全的经济基础之上，而是建立在帝国主义、买办官僚资本相互结合的基础之上，所以要把过去帝国主义买办官僚剥削压榨中国人民的旧上海转变为真正独立自主和不依赖外国帝国主义的新上海，便必然要暂时遇到许多的困难。例如，那些原来依靠帝国主义原料和燃料的工业，不能不暂时遭受困难；又如那些过去为帝国主义者买办、官僚、地主、军阀之流的享乐而生产的工商业，今后必须改变生产方针，不能不暂时遭受困难；再如那些过去属于国民党及官僚资本的企业，在我们接管之后必须加以改造，也不能不暂时发生某些困难。因为在上海六百万人口中，实际上直接和间接参加生产的人口不过三百万人，不生产的人口达到三百万人之多；要把如此众多的消费人员变为生产人员，或把他们疏散回乡生产，这是一种复杂而艰巨的工作。但是我们清楚知道，上述这些困难，都是胜利和发展中的困难，是完全可以克服的。所以我们没有为上述这些困难而气馁，而动摇解放上海的决心；相反，我们不怕这些困难，并准备克服这些困难。
    我们建设新上海的方针，就是要把过去帝国主义、买办、官僚剥削压榨中国人民的旧上海，变成为国内生产与为中国人民服务的新上海；就是要把过去畸形发展的旧上海，改造成为真正健全繁荣的新上海。但是要完成这一伟大的改造工作，就必须在上海摆脱对帝国主义经济的依赖。我们知道，要把过去完全依靠帝国主义经济而生存发展的旧上海，转变为完全不依赖帝国主义经济而真正独立自主的新上海，这不是一件轻而易举的事；这是一件极端复杂而艰巨的工作，而且必须经过一个暂时的表面的“后退”与“紧缩”过程。这正如割治盲肠炎或医治其他严重病症的病人须要经过一个暂时的“体重减轻”，俟病症完全去除，然后始能恢复正常的健康一样。正由于我们知道要把过去一个病态臃肿的旧上海改造成为一个健全繁荣的新上海，须要经过一个暂时的表面的“后退”与“紧缩”的艰苦过程，所以我们在上海解放之初，曾采取了和目前仍继续采取着许多稳健的慎重的过渡办法，例如宽大的对外贸易政策与对海外交通的鼓励方针，又例如对棉花入口的免税及对若干出入口货物的奖励等等，力图避免过大的波动，以求达到逐渐改造和等待群众觉悟程度提高的目的。但是帝国主义及其走狗国民党残余势力，不但不因人民政府的宽大与其自身军事政治的惨败，而改变其对华侵略政策及与中国人民为敌的破坏阴谋；相反，帝国主义正指使其走狗国民党残余势力向我上海和平居民不断进行轰炸、扫射，及对上海和我沿海各港口实行武装封锁。他们企图用这些野蛮方法来阻止我内外交通，断绝我煤粮及工业原料的供给，来破坏我上海生产建设，来逼我向帝国主义投降就范。
    我们可以预言，现在帝国主义指使国民党残余势力企图用轰炸扫射及武装封锁等办法，来加深我经济上困难和逼我投降就范，他们这些企图会象过去历次使用过的各种危害我们的阴谋一样，必将遭到完全破产！在三年前，美帝国主义者指使国民党反动派用反动的内战向中国人民解放军和中国人民进攻，企图把中国共产党和中国人民一齐淹死在内战的血海中。可是结果不是中国共产党和中国人民的失败，而是美帝国主义自己的失败，和他的走狗国民党反动派的灭亡。
    帝国主义者指使国民党残余势力向上海人民轰炸扫射与向中国人民进行武装封锁，决不能动摇中国人民彻底驱逐帝国主义侵略势力出中国，和彻底消灭国民党残余反动势力的决心，决不能动摇伟大中国人民对光明前途的乐观。我们号召全上海的工人、学生、近郊农民、一切劳动群众、一切进步的文化界、产业界人士和一切爱国的民主人士们，为粉碎敌人的轰炸封锁，为建设健全繁荣的新上海而一致团结起来，坚决实行下列任务：
    一、积极支援人民解放军南下作战，迅速解放福建、台湾，并配合全国各地解放其他一切尚未解放的地区。这是回答敌机轰炸扫射及粉碎帝国主义、国民党残余势力对上海和我沿海各港口武装封锁的最有效的办法。现在人民解放军的各路野战军正在向南方和西北各省，执行着自有历史以来未曾有过的大进军。我们必须尽一切可能的力量，支援人民解放军迅速解放全中国！我们必须尽一切可能的力量，支援后方警备部队，巩固后方，坚决肃清潜伏的特务匪类！我们必须明白，在拿枪的敌人被消灭后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然要用各种方法和我们作拼死的斗争，如果我们轻视这些敌人，就要犯极大的错误。（⑴⑵）
    二、有计划地有步骤地实行疏散人员和实行将部分学校工厂内迁。首先应动员大批难民与失业群众回乡生产和到皖北黄泛地区与苏北盐垦区垦荒生产。并应劝导一切逃亡地主与受敌欺骗来沪的地主富农及被敌迫来沪的农民和青年，立即各返原乡参加生产；即使其中有一部分是曾经欺压农民的地主富农，只要他能改过自新，回家生产，则当地政府与人民定能宽大处理。此外，应在可能和必要的条件下鼓励某些学校工厂内迁，以便就粮，就煤，就原料，以改变目前上海拥挤现象，减少城市负担。但工厂内迁是一件复杂而艰巨的工作。这不但必须依照各厂自愿的原则，而且必须有充分周密的计划和准备，否则，可能造成损失，增加困难。我们对学校和文化教育机关采取严格保护政策，但一切国民教育的计划（大学教育、各专科教育、中学教育、小学教育和成人补习教育），必须适合当前革命形势和革命任务的需要。文化、艺术、新闻工作也应当如此。
    三、改变今后上海生产方针与发展方向。无论公营或私营企业都应设法摆脱对帝国主义经济的依赖，并应把为国内生产、为中国人民服务作为今后上海一切企业生产的方针与发展的方向（例如大量生产国内各城市、各矿山所需要的机器，各农村所需要的农具、肥料、布匹等）。因为只有国内各城市经济发展与农业生产力提高，上海工业生产基础才有保证，才可以自力更生和摆脱对帝国主义的依赖。同时，在上海继续生产的各公营企业，必须精简组织，提高效率，认真做到经营企业化，和管理民主化，并且必须使两者很好地结合。对私营企业必须贯彻“公私兼顾、劳资两利”的方针。必须特别注意正确地处理劳资关系。我们必须把工会工作做好。要教育与团结全体工人及其他劳动者，照顾他们的利益，关心他们的生活，提高他们政治觉悟与文化水平；但另方面，必须防止左的情绪和偏向，一切要求不但要符合社会的一般生产水平和生活水平，而且要照顾各个工厂的具体情况。对私人资本家，我们除了对投机奸商以及对任何违反政府法令的行为应依法取缔外，均应采取坚决保护政策。我们欢迎他们投资到有利国计民生的各种生产事业中去。在整个新民主主义历史时期，从事有利国计民生生产事业的自由资产阶级是我们的朋友，我们必须联合他们，和他们一同努力克服当前的困难，并向他们学习经营生产、管理工厂的知识。我们城市工作的方针，仍然是遵照毛主席“发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利”的原则，去正确领导劳资关系、公私关系、城乡关系、内外关系。
    四、动员大批共产党员、干部和工人、学生到乡村去开展农村工作。必须动员大批工人、学生与党员干部到农村工作，动员广大农民群众肃清土匪，改造政权，发展生产，克服灾荒，并有系统地有步骤地进行土地改革，使农民从封建压迫剥削中，完全解放出来。这是目前全华东党、全华东人民具有头等重要意义的任务。因为只有使广大农民生活改善及农业生产提高，才能一面扩大工业品所必需的市场，另方面供给城市更多粮食和工业原料。因为只有依靠广大国内的市场及广大农村供给足够的粮食和原料，才能使上海及江南各城市真正走上健全与繁荣发展的轨道。过去由于我们干部首先集中城市进行接管工作及人民解放军继续猛烈前进追歼敌人，来不及加强农村工作，故今天江南农村区、乡两级政权，仍然大部控制在地主富农和旧保甲长的手中。他们勾结土匪及国民党特务残余势力压迫人民，破坏社会秩序。我们必须集中力量，展开农村工作，克服目前江南农村中所存在的上述严重现象。在上海近郊，目前应特别加紧沿海沿塘工程的抢修与救济风灾的工作。
    五、发展内地交通，鼓励城乡物资交流。帝国主义指使国民党残余势力，以封锁办法来阻止和割断我内外交流的关系，为了粉碎敌人这种封锁阴谋，我们就必须迅速发展内地交通，努力修筑铁路和公路，改善内河航运，组织各种合作社，鼓励内地物资交流，加强城乡互助，以发展和繁荣国内经济。
    六、实行节衣缩食，克服目前困难。一切党政军民组织，必须厉行精简机关，紧缩编制，清理资材，建立制度，节省开支，反对浪费，提倡艰苦朴素作风，克服奢侈浮华的习气。特别是我党我军干部，必须以自己模范的行动和艰苦卓绝的精神来影响和推动全上海和华东人民进行节衣缩食运动，来克服当前的困难。但我们精简节约的目的，是为了加强工作效率，以便发展生产，及克服目前生活困难。因此对一切应当裁的机关和人员，必须坚决进行精简；但对一切必需的生产机构和工作机关，则必须加强。对一切可节省和应节省的经费，必须节省；但对于工作需要与最低限度的开支的供给必须保证。对被裁减的人员，必须妥善地处理，不能在裁减以后置之不管。总之，一切应从生产和工作的必需出发，并必须从长期打算。
    这里我们还愿意顺带声明一下，我们决不因为帝国主义指使国民党残余势力向我进行扫射封锁，而改变我们对一切外侨的政策。我们仍坚决执行毛主席、朱总司令在约法八章中所规定的对一切外侨的政策，即对守法安业者必予切实的保护，对违反法令者必予应得之处分，对犯法之后愿意改过者予以宽大的处理。
    诸位代表先生们！同志们！这些就是我党对于粉碎敌人封锁的方针，也就是我党建设新上海的方针。如果诸位先生不反对的话，就让我们大家亲密团结起来，共同努力，为粉碎敌人的封锁，为建设新上海而奋斗。
    上海工人和上海青年学生有悠久的光荣的革命传统，过去对中国革命有极其巨大的贡献。上海工人、学生、近郊农民、一切劳动群众及进步的文化界、产业界和爱国的民主人士，在上海解放前的护厂护校，及其他各种斗争中给我们以很大的鼓舞和配合；在上海解放后的接管工作，与反对帝国主义挑衅及反对国民党潜伏分子破坏中，和我们亲密合作，给我们极大的帮助。我可以说，如果没有他们的配合和援助，我们要取得今天的成绩和胜利，是不可能的。我们对上海工人、学生、近郊农民、进步的文化界、产业界及其他上海人民，过去对我党所表示的信任和拥护，特致衷心的感谢；我们热烈欢迎上海工人、学生、近郊农民、进步的文化界、产业界及一切爱国的民主人士们，在今后反对敌人封锁及建设新上海的斗争中，继续我们亲密合作。
    诸位先生们！同志们！在我们粉碎敌人封锁，建设新上海的斗争中，我们并不是孤立的，全世界劳动人民，和全中国的人民，都是与我们一起的。全上海的工人、学生、近郊农民、一切劳动群众、一切进步的文化界、产业界和一切爱国的民主人士，在粉碎敌人封锁，与建设新上海的纲领下都一致坚固团结起来了。我们有抗日战争中长期自力更生粉碎敌人封锁的经验，并可学习苏联十月革命后，打败了十四个国家对它的干涉与封锁，建设了一个强盛繁荣幸福的社会主义国家的经验。我们有中国共产党和中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东同志的领导。他领导中国工人阶级和中国人民，经过几十年的艰苦斗争，克服了比现在大得无可比拟的困难，取得今天这样伟大的胜利。因此，我们一定能够克服我们目前的困难，和争取建设新上海的胜利！
    今天这个临时性的各界代表会议，很有意义，这个会议将为将来用普选方法选举的正式的上海人民代表会议准备条件和基础。这种各界代表会议不但便于将共产党的方针与人民政府的政策传达到广大群众，使之成为群众的行动，而且便于将人民的意见反映给共产党和人民政府，使之成为共产党的政策，和人民政府的法令的根据。我建议这种各界代表会议今后应多开，应常开，以便保证人民政府与人民间的密切联系。
