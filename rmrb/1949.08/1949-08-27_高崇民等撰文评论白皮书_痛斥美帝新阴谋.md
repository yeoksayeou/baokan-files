Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th. Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee and Chief of the Northeast General Branch of the China Democratic League, Che Xiangchen, Minister of Education of the Northeast Administrative Committee, Deng Zhaoxiang, Principal of the Naval Academy, and Zhang Dexin, Vice President of Northeast University, have recently written articles commenting on the American "White Paper," denouncing the new conspiracy of American imperialism to invade China.

Gao Chongmin

Gao Chongmin pointed out: Acheson's "White Paper" reflects the complete failure of American imperialists' interference in China and also exposes the ambition of American imperialism to persist in invading China. Referring to Acheson's so-called "democratic individualists," Gao Chongmin said: There is indeed such a kind of person, whose typical thought is: the Kuomintang is not good, and the Communist Party is not good either, it is best for someone like me to come to power. The American imperialists have taken a fancy to this kind of person, Acheson wants to give this kind of person a hand, wanting to use them to make trouble, to undermine the new China of the people's democratic dictatorship. I hope that this group of confused gentlemen will transform their thinking. If they do not transform well, they will eventually reach a dead end, which will not benefit either themselves or the revolution. I hope this group of confused gentlemen will study the "White Paper" carefully and treat the "White Paper" as a sobering agent.

Che Xiangchen

Che Xiangchen said: Imperialism has always been hypocritical, especially American imperialism. In order to invade China, American imperialism has used the means of winning over Chinese "liberals" and "democratic individualists" for decades, attempting to deceive and numb the Chinese people through them, so that the Chinese people would honestly be obedient citizens of American imperialism and turn China into a colony of the United States. The White Paper published by the United States is the biggest proof. Take Stuart as an example. He is a complete old liar of American imperialism. When he talks, he always says: "I was born in China, I love America, and I also love China." This old set of anesthetics is the easiest to numb those Chinese people who lack political awareness. In fact, his every move and every word contains aggressive intentions, either to provoke the relationship between the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party, or to provoke friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union. What American imperialism fears most is that the Chinese people unite around the Communist Party and unite with the people of the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union in the world. But now, the provokers have exhausted all means, and it is impossible to have the slightest effect, because the Chinese people have become aware that the Communist Party is their savior, the Soviet Union is our closest international friend, and also a friend of democratic countries all over the world. And American imperialism is our Chinese people's mortal enemy. Conscientious Chinese people who once had illusions about the United States should clear their heads, distinguish between enemies and friends, so as not to be deceived.

Deng Zhaoxiang

Deng Zhaoxiang cited the situation he knew about how American imperialism used the Kuomintang navy to invade China and slaughter the Chinese people as an example, saying: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit group used traitorous treaties that sold out military ports and navigation rights to exchange for American imperialist warships. What kind of ships did they get? They were the so-called escort destroyers, minesweepers, submarines, landing craft, etc. within the scope of surplus materials. American imperialism knew very well that the Chiang-controlled areas had no mines to sweep, no submarines to drive away, no navigation to protect, and no land to land on. It was obvious that it wanted Chiang bandits to use them to oppose the Chinese people, to use them to plunder the ships and materials of the people in the liberated areas, and to use them as bodyguards to transport reactionary troops to the liberated areas to massacre the people. And the bombing of the "Chongqing" warship in March was a crime directly manufactured by American imperialism. We must remember and avenge this hatred. Just based on these things, isn't American imperialism's cruelty to the Chinese people very obvious? American imperialism pretends to have a good heart and makes the total account of aggression sound so beautiful in the White Paper, as if its aggression has always been for the benefit of China, and portrays the Soviet Union as an aggressor. Thank you for its "good intentions". The Chinese people will naturally distinguish between enemies and friends, will make proper choices, and will stand on one side. But we want to stand on the side of the anti-aggression and peace camp headed by Soviet socialism, and we will never stand on the side of the imperialist camp that carries out foreign aggression and internal oppression and exploitation of the people.

Zhang Dexin

Zhang Dexin said: The American imperialist so-called "aid to China" and the Soviet Union's one-year trade agreement with Northeast China are a clear contrast. One is to create civil war in China, and the other is to help China's peaceful construction. Who is our enemy and who is our friend is very obvious! The Soviet Union is the pillar of world peace. The Chinese people have united and stood firmly on the side of the Soviet Union, fighting heroically to defend world peace. The US-Chiang reactionaries are unwilling to perish. We must also be vigilant and fight actively. We must destroy all their conspiracies.

　　高崇民等撰文评论白皮书
  　痛斥美帝新阴谋
    【新华社沈阳二十六日电】东北行政委员会副主席、中国民主同盟东北总负责人高崇民、东北行政委员会教育部长车向忱、海军学校校长邓兆祥及东北大学副校长张德馨等顷撰文评论美国“白皮书”，痛斥美帝国主义新的侵华阴谋。
  　高崇民
    高崇民指出：艾奇逊的“白皮书”，反映了美帝国主义者干涉中国的彻底失败，也暴露了美帝国主义坚持侵华的野心。论及艾奇逊所谓的“民主个人主义者”时，高崇民说：的确有这样一种人，这种人的典型思想是：国民党不好，共产党也不好，最好是由我这样的人出来当权。美帝国主义者看中了这种人，艾奇逊要拉这种人一把，想利用他们来捣乱，来破坏人民民主专政的新中国。我希望这一部分思想糊涂的先生们改造思想，如果不改造好，迟早会走到绝境的，无论于他个人或于革命都无好处。希望这一部分糊涂先生好好研究研究“白皮书”，把“白皮书”当作清醒剂。
  　车向忱
    车向忱说：帝国主义一贯是假仁假义的，尤以美帝国主义为最。美帝国主义为侵略中国，几十年，用拢络中国“自由主义”和“民主个人主义”的手段，企图通过他们来欺骗、麻醉中国人民，使中国人民老老实实地做美帝国主义的顺民，把中国变成美国的殖民地，美国所发表的白皮书，就是最大的证明。拿司徒雷登来说，他是个美帝的十足的老骗子，他谈起话来，总是说：“我生在中国，我爱美国，我也爱中国。”这老一套麻醉剂是最容易麻醉那些没有政治认识的中国人的。其实他的一举一动，一言一行都有侵略作用在内的，不是挑拨中国人民对中国共产党的关系，就是挑拨中苏友好关系。美帝国主义最怕的是中国人民团结在共产党周围，和世界上中苏两个大国的人民团结起来。但是现在挑拨者用尽了千方百计，也不可能有丝毫效果了，因为中国人民有了觉悟，知道共产党是自己的救星，苏联是我们最密切的国际友人，也是世界各民主国家的友人。而美帝国主义则是我们中国人民的死敌。对美国曾有幻想的有良心的中国人，应该清醒头脑，分清敌友，免得受骗。
  　邓兆祥
    邓兆祥以他所知道的美帝国主义利用国民党海军侵略中国和屠杀中国人民的情形举例说：蒋匪集团用出卖军港、出卖航权的卖国条约去换取美帝国主义的军舰，换得些什么舰呢？就是那些在剩余物资范围内的所谓护航驱逐舰啦，扫雷艇啦，潜艇啦，登陆艇啦等等。美帝国主义明知蒋管区无雷可扫，无潜可驱，无航须护，无陆须登，很明显地就是要蒋匪用它们去反对中国人民，用它们去劫掠解放区内人民的船只和物资，用它们来作保镖去运送反动军队到解放区屠杀人民。而三月间“重庆”号军舰的被炸，就是由美帝国主义直接制造的罪行。我们要记住并报复这个仇恨。单就这些，美帝国主义对中国人民的残虐还不十分明显吗？美帝国主义假装有副好心肠，在白皮书内把一篇侵略总帐说得那么动听，仿佛它从来侵略都是为中国利益的，而把苏联说成侵略者。谢谢他的“善意”，中国人民自会分清敌人和友人，自会妥为选择，自会站向一边，可是我们要站的是以苏联社会主义为首的反侵略的和平阵营的一边，绝不会站在对外侵略对内压迫剥削人民的帝国主义阵营的一边。
  　张德馨
    张德馨说：美帝国主义所谓“援华”和苏联与东北一年贸易协定，是个鲜明的对照。一是在中国制造内战，一是帮助中国和平建设。谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的友人，这是很明显的！苏联是世界和平的支柱。中国人民已经团结起来，并紧紧站立在苏联方面，为保卫世界和平而英勇奋斗。美蒋反动派是不甘心灭亡的。我们还要提高警惕，积极奋斗。我们必须摧毁他们的一切阴谋。
