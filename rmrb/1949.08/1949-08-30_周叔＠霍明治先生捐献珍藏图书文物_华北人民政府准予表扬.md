　　[Ping City News] Following Mr. He Kongcai of Beiping donating books and cultural relics, Mr. Zhou Shu＠, General Manager of Tianjin Qixin Cement Company, and Mr. Huo Mingzhi, have also donated cherished books and cultural relics, receiving commendation from the North China People's Government. Mr. Zhou Shu＠ handed over the domestically unique Song Dynasty edition of "Classic Translation," which he purchased for two taels of gold, to Professor Tang Lan of Peking University to be transferred to the Higher Education Commission. Combined with the twenty-three volumes in the collection of the Palace Museum, it will become a complete set. Elder Mr. Huo Mingzhi donated his lifelong collection of books, totaling 10,790 volumes, and 3,992 pieces of precious bronzes, stone carvings, lacquerware, and other cultural relics (with the remaining part currently being inventoried) to the government. These books and cultural relics have been allocated by the Higher Education Commission to the Palace Museum, the Beiping Library, and the History Museum for safekeeping. The North China People's Government believes that the spirit of the two gentlemen in transforming private collections into public assets for the benefit of the people should be commended and has approved the issuance of "Certificates of Commendation" by the North China Higher Education Commission to encourage them.
