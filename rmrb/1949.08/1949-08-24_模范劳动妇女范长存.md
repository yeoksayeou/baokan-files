Model Labor Woman Fan Changcun
	Xue Li, Kai Ke (organized)

	Fan Changcun, a model labor woman from Weijiazhuang, Third District, Nangong County, is 42 years old, has bound feet, and lives with her 74-year-old blind mother-in-law and two children. She farms 24 mu of land, doing all the plowing, sowing, hoeing, and weeding herself, and her crops grow much better than others'.

	Fan Changcun's maiden home is Lvjiazhuang, Zhentang County. She rarely left her home village when she was young and learned excellent needlework skills. At the age of nineteen, she married Wei Hengxun. Her husband was a spoiled son who loved to gamble from a young age. After separating from his brother in 1937, he gambled even more, and the family's financial situation deteriorated. In the winter of 1942, he lost more than 400 jin of cotton, and in 1943, during the famine, he even lost two bags of wheat. As a result, the couple often argued. In June, forced by gambling debts, he fled to Taiyuan, threatening Changcun before leaving: "I'm leaving, you take care of the old and young and live a good life!" Changcun replied, "Even if you leave, we'll live the same way."

	Hengxun left behind his blind mother, four-year-old Hongen, and still breast-feeding Shuangqun. There was no rice in the pot and no firewood to light the fire. However, Changcun was not defeated. Instead, she said with full confidence, "I must live a good life and prove myself!" At this time, she first sold her few dowry clothes, bought a few jin of rice, and with the remaining fifty or sixty yuan, started selling used clothes. It wasn't until July 11th of the lunar calendar that the rain finally fell, and the anti-Japanese government called for rushing to plant late crops and vegetables. She first weeded the fields, borrowed seeds, and planted two mu of buckwheat and one mu each of late millet and radishes. At first, she felt very ashamed going to the market and stores, but after a painful inner struggle, she realized that this was better than dragging her children to beg for food! When the seedlings emerged, she happily said, "The land doesn't discriminate against people. As long as you work hard, anyone can grow crops!" She then spent the whole day weeding the seedlings. Her hands blistered, and she pricked them with a needle and continued to weed. When the children cried, she carried them to the fields, shaded them, and then continued to weed. In her spare time, she had to go to the market, come home to cook, and take care of her elderly mother-in-law and children. When the buckwheat ripened, she also fell ill, not eating rice soup for three days. When she felt a little better, she went to the fields to harvest, carrying bundles home one by one. Her shoulders were chafed raw, but she gritted her teeth and carried on. That year, she harvested three bags of buckwheat, sixty jin of millet, and two thousand jin of radishes. The blind mother-in-law touched the radishes and said with a bitter smile, "Even if Hengxun were home, he couldn't grow such big radishes!" The masses praised her for being stronger than Hengxun, and she overcame the famine in this way.

	The following spring, the government called for the elimination of wasteland. She sold her quilt and bought an ox with her nephew Hongjun, and asked her brother Fan Zhuang to teach her how to plow the land. Zhuang opened the furrow and led the ox, while she held the plow. The plowed land was crooked and winding like rabbit burrows, making her ashamed to look at others at the edge of the field. But she was determined to learn hard. By the end of spring, she had learned all the farming tasks and began to farm independently.

	She ate two meals a day, mixing bran with vegetables, and couldn't bear to eat anything good during festivals. She made a day's worth of food in the morning and took the children to the fields, returning home only when it was dark. She got up early and went to bed late, removed manure in the moonlight, ground grain at night, and, in addition to spinning thread in the winter, she also made clothes for all four seasons. Because she was frugal and worked hard, she not only had enough to eat and wear, but also had savings. She was able to buy farm tools, furniture, and fertilizer. In the past five years, she has added a seeder, harrow, cover, square table, wardrobe... Three families jointly bought a cart the year before last. This family, which was about to go bankrupt, has been made prosperous by Changcun in recent years. When the land was distributed last year, she went to the work team to offer her land. The masses said that she had never exploited anyone and worked well, so they did not take her land and explained to her the Communist Party's policy of protecting middle peasants. Grateful, she said, "We women and children wouldn't be able to live if the government didn't protect us. The thieves would have stolen everything long ago!"

	This spring, the village set a production plan: the whole village would plant a total of 750 mu of cotton, each household with ten mu of land would plant four mu of cotton, each household would raise three chickens, plant a tree, and an average of one pig would be raised for every four households. With the help of the village cadres, she formulated a year-round production plan and announced it at the mass meeting: the whole family has a total of 24 mu of land. Last year, eight mu were planted with cotton, yielding 90 jin per mu. This year, twelve mu will be planted, hoed three times and weeded four times, increasing production to 120 jin per mu, with an additional 60 jin of sesame. Five mu of millet will be planted, last year yielding 150 jin per mu, increasing to 200 jin, with an additional 100 jin of white beans. One mu of sorghum will be planted, yielding 200 jin. One mu of peanuts will be tried, yielding 300 jin. One mu will be used for melons and vegetables, and three mu will be reserved for wheat land, plowed four times, and sorghum and millet will be hoed and weeded three times each. 20 large carts of fertilizer will be made for wheat sowing. 1,000 jin of soybean cakes will be applied to cotton and millet land (bought last winter), and twelve carts of manure. The tasks for raising chickens and pigs and planting hemp and trees will all be exceeded.

	After the meeting, she and her children carried water to plant ten willow trees and two elm trees before Qingming Festival, and planted more than 250 hemp plants. When the weather was dry and the ground was hard, she watered each tree. Then she started sowing, helping the Hongmao family, taking turns using the seeder to sow seeds, twelve-year-old Hongen pulled the roller, and eight-year-old Shuangqun led the ox. The cotton of the two families was planted in three days. Because she harrowed the ground many times, the soil was moist and the furrow was good, the seedlings emerged evenly. The masses going to the market in Sucun said, "I've walked twelve li and haven't seen such a good cotton field with straight ridges and even seedlings." The villagers reflected, "Fan Lao who used to take the lead in sowing every year, has been surpassed by Changcun."

	Under her leadership, 825 mu of cotton were planted in the whole village, exceeding the task by 110 mu. In addition to actively making fertilizer, dismantling kangs and old walls, each household bought a total of 48,500 jin of soybean cakes and applied them to cotton and millet land.

	She is also a very resourceful person in managing her life. She feeds eight hens, and the eggs are all sold. The money from the sales is enough to buy feed for the ox. Her profitable chicken raising has led the women to raise more chickens. When the first person selling chicks came this year, she bought nineteen first, and others saw it and bought two baskets of chickens in a short while. Wei Qingtang stopped his wife from buying chickens, so the couple quarreled, and eventually bought ten. She said, "The eggs laid by three live chickens are enough to exchange for the whole family's oil and salt."

	Others complained that raising pigs was not cost-effective, but Changcun did not. She steamed tree leaves, wild vegetables, and sweet potato leaves for the pigs every year, and swept up several stacks of sweet potato vines every year. Because she fed them diligently, the pigs were very fat. The small pig bought in March last year grew to 140 jin by the beginning of May this year and was sold for 800,000 Jiao. In addition to buying another small pig, she also measured out 220 jin of millet, she said: "Feed the pigs with things that can't be eaten, and exchange them for grain and create a lot of manure."

	When the wheat turned yellow, District Chief Zhang Baoxi went to visit her production. She happily told the District Chief: "The land has been hoed twice, and we are preparing to harvest the wheat!" District Chief Zhang praised her and said, "You are really quick. Some people haven't even finished hoeing the first time!"

	On the afternoon of April 26th of the lunar calendar, she and her children went to pull wheat and didn't finish until dawn. This year, other people's wheat only yielded one bag per mu (each bag is eight market dou), but her four mu of wheat yielded six bags.

	After entering June, with frequent rains, a good autumn harvest is expected. The branch put forward a call for further increasing production. Her plan for further increasing production is: cotton will yield 150 jin to 180 jin per mu, millet will yield 200 jin to 300 jin, peanuts will yield 350 jin, and sorghum will yield 250 jin. To this end, every time it rained thoroughly, she weeded the seedlings once. She pulled the weeder and Hongen helped, weeding the cotton and millet in one and a half days, sweating all over, but unwilling to rest. She told others, "If you want a good harvest, you have to weed diligently and use a lot of fertilizer." Now she is trimming the branches on the cotton and has taught the children, while also publicizing to others that trimming the branches well can increase the yield by more than 20 jin per mu.

	Her experience with soybean cakes is that spreading soybean cakes all over the ground is very effective. Her cotton and millet, in addition to applying fifty or sixty jin of soybean cakes per mu, also applied a cart of manure. Other crops are growing very well, but the millet is not as good as the neighbor Wei Qinhua's. She added 100 jin of black beans and more than 20 jin of sesame seeds to the millet field for the second time. As of June 15th, his crops had been hoed three times and weeded four times, and she planned to weed twice more and hoe once more. She is determined and confident to achieve the goal of increasing production.

	Since she bought the ox, sometimes she goes out to transport goods. The village cadres find someone to exchange work to drive the cart for her, but she feels that this is not a long-term solution. In 1947, during the Anyang Campaign, she personally went to Weixian to deliver public grain. Since then, she has been driving the cart herself, so everyone in the villages knows that the female carter is a labor hero.

	Because she loves labor and is fair, she has been elected as a labor model twice in the village. During the party rectification, she was elected as a representative of the masses. In this process, she further understood the Communist Party's policy of developing production and often happily publicized, "Don't be nervous in the future; just concentrate on production!"

	In the past, women in Weijiazhuang rarely went to the fields except for spinning and weaving. According to a survey, there are a total of 109 women aged fifteen to fifty in the village. Eight women's associations do all the farming tasks, and eighty-seven women participate in the main field labor, with only a few people not going to the fields.

	Fan Changcun's model deeds have spread to various villages and reached the ears of Wei Hengxun, who is far away in Shimen. He has written to Fan Changcun to apologize. Recently, when county cadres went to investigate her model deeds, Wei Qiyu, an elderly farmer in the village, said with a proud and glorious expression, "You won't find a second female labor hero like this in our village no matter how many villages you visit. Don't look at her small feet, she is very capable of farming!" The blind mother-in-law on the kang said with pride and gratitude, "My daughter-in-law is different from others. Without her, I wouldn't be able to live to this day, and we wouldn't have been able to survive even the famine years!" Fan Changcun is indeed a banner of labor women, demonstrating that women can independently produce and become rich. Therefore, she has won the joint commendation from the Nangong County Committee, the Women's Federation, and the County Government, as well as the support and praise of the villagers.

　　模范劳动妇女范长存
    薛力  楷克整理
    南宫县三区魏家庄，妇女劳动模范范长存，年四十二岁，小脚，家中有七十四岁的瞎婆婆和两个孩子，种着二十四亩地，耕耩锄耪全告她，庄稼长的比别人强的多。
    范长存的娘家，系振堂县吕家庄，从小没出过大门，学会一手好针线。十九岁上嫁给魏恒勋，丈夫是个娇生子，自幼好耍钱，民国二十六年同其兄分家后，更大肆赌博，家境越过越坏。三十一年冬天，曾输了四百多斤棉花，三十二年闹灾荒还输了两布袋麦子，因此俩口子常常呕气，六月里被赌债逼的逃往太原，临走威胁长存说：“我走了，你守着老小过好日子吧！”长存的回答：“你走了我们也是一样过。”
    恒勋走了，留下双眼瞎的老娘，四岁的洪恩和还在吃奶的双群，下锅没米，点火没柴，可是长存没被难倒，反而信心十足的说：“我一定要把日子过好，争这口气！”这时她首先把自己仅有的几件嫁时衣卖掉，量了几斤米，剩下五六十元，开始贩卖起估衣来。旧历七月十一日才落了透雨，抗日政府号召抢种晚田及蔬菜，她先锄去地里的草，借来种籽，种上了二亩荞麦和晚谷、萝＠各一亩，起初她赶集上店觉着很害臊，经过沉痛的内心斗争，才觉到这总比拉着孩子要饭吃去强哪！等苗出来了欢喜的她说：“地不挑拣人，只要卖力气，谁种也行呀！”她便整天去锄苗，手上磨了泡，用针挑破了还锄，孩子啼哭抱他到地里，替他遮上凉再锄，抽空还得赶集，回家又得作饭和伺候老人和孩子。荞麦熟了，她也累病了，三天汤米未进；病轻些便到地里去收割，一捆一捆往家背，肩勒破了咬着牙背。那年收了三口袋荞麦，六十斤谷，两千斤萝＠，瞎婆婆摸着萝＠苦笑着说：“俺恒勋在家也长不了这么大萝＠！”群众都赞叹她比恒勋强，她就这样战胜了灾荒。
    第二年春天，政府号召消灭荒地，她又把被子卖掉，和她侄洪俊伙买了头牛，把兄弟范振庄叫来教她耕地。振庄打开墒牵着牛，她扶着犁，耕的地曲曲弯弯的象兔子窝，羞的她到地头上，不敢看别人，但她决心努力学，春天过去全套庄稼活算学会了，从此便独立的种起地来。
    天天吃两顿饭，掺糠吃菜，过节都舍不得吃点好的。早上作出一天的饭，带着孩子下地，天黑才回家。早起晚睡，月下除粪坑，黑夜套碾磨，冬天除纺线外，还作出四季应穿的衣服。因她省吃俭用，积极劳动，不但有了吃穿，还有了节余。能够制买农具家具和肥料，前后五年当中，共添了耧、耙、盖、方桌、立柜……。前年三家合着买了辆大车，这个将要破产的家庭，几年来，叫长存给过富裕了。去年平分土地时她曾找到工作组去献地，群众说她没剥削过人，劳动好，不收她的，并向她解释了共产党保护中农的政策，感激的她说：“俺这娘们孩子过日子，要不是政府保护着，东西早被小偷们偷完了！”
    今春，该村订的生产计划：全村共植棉七百五十亩，每户有十亩地的要种棉四亩，每户养三只鸡，栽活一棵树，每四户平均养一只猪。她在村干帮助下，订好全年的生产计划，在群众大会上公布：全家共地二十四亩，去年植棉八亩，每亩产棉九十斤；今年植十二亩，锄三遍耘四遍，增产到每亩百二十斤，附收芝麻六十斤。种五亩谷，去年每亩产一百五十斤，增产到二百斤，附收白豆一百斤。种高粱一亩，收二百斤。试种花生一亩，产三百斤。其他种瓜菜一亩，留麦地三亩，耕四遍，高粱谷锄耘各三遍，至耩麦造肥二十大车，棉和谷共施豆饼一千斤（去冬已买下）、粪十二车。养鸡、猪、栽大麻子、树都超过任务。
    会后，她和孩子于清明节前抬水栽柳树十棵，榆树两棵，种大麻子二百五十多棵。天旱地干出不来，她挨棵浇水。接着进行播种，和洪卯家互助，轮流着拿耧撒籽，十二岁的洪恩拉砘子，八岁的双群牵牛，三天种完两家的棉花。因她把地盖耙的遍数多，土湿墒好，苗出来的齐，苏村赶集的群众说：“走了十二里地，没见过这么块垄直苗齐的好棉花。”村中群众反映：“年年播种带头的樊老着，叫长存给赶过去了。”
    在她的带动下，全村植棉八百二十五亩，超过任务一百一十亩，各户除积极造肥，打炕拆旧墙外，共买豆饼四万八千五百斤，施在棉谷地里。
    她又是个过日子很有盘算的人，喂着八只母鸡，鸡蛋都卖掉，卖的钱足够给牛买料吃用。她喂鸡获利的事实，引起妇女们都多养起鸡来。今年第一个卖小鸡的过来，她先买了十九只，别人见到一会把两筐鸡就买完了。魏庆堂阻止他老婆买鸡，因此俩口子吵起来，结果也买了十只。她说：“活三只鸡下蛋，就够换全家的油盐吃了。”
    别人嚷养猪不上算，长存喂猪却不然，她每年是给猪蒸树叶、野菜、山芋叶，年年扫下几囤山芋菜，因她喂的勤，猪很肥，去年三月买的小猪，今年五月初就长到百四十斤，卖了冀钞八十万元，除又买了个小猪外，还量了二百二十斤谷子，她说：“把不能吃的东西喂了猪，换回粮食还造了好多粪。”
    麦子黄了的时候，张保相区长去访问她的生产，她高兴的告诉区长：“地都锄过了两遍，正准备收麦哩！”张区长称赞她说：“你真沾，差不多的头遍还未锄完哩！”
    旧历四月二十六日的下午，她同孩子去拔麦，天明才拔完，今年别家麦子每亩合不上一口袋（每袋八市斗计），她四亩麦子打了六口袋。
    入六月后，雨勤秋收可望，支部提出再增产的号召，她再增产的计划是：棉花每亩收一百五十斤至一百八十斤，谷子收二百斤至三百斤，花生收三百五十斤，高粱收二百五十斤。为此，每下次透雨，她就耘苗一遍，她拉耘锄洪恩扶着，一天半耘完棉花和谷子，累的混身是汗，都不肯歇。她向别人说：“要想多收成，只有耘勤锄多多使粪”。现在她正在收拾棉花上的杈，并教会了孩子，同时向别人宣传，杈打好每亩能多收二十多斤。
    她使豆饼的经验是，耩豆饼遍地撒劲大，她的棉花和谷，每亩除上了五六十斤豆饼，又追了一车粪。别的庄稼都长的很好，惟独谷子不如地邻魏勤华的强，她又把一百斤黑豆，二十多斤芝麻，二次追在谷地里。截至六月十五日，他的庄稼锄了三遍，耘了四遍，并打算再耘两遍锄一遍，她坚决和有信心的达到增产要求。
    自她买牛后，有时出车，村干给她找好换工的去赶车，她觉着这么着不是长法。三十六年安阳战役，她亲身去威县送公粮，至今出车都是她赶，因此，各村都知道女车夫是劳动英雄。
    因为她爱好劳动为人公正，村中两次选她为劳动模范，整党时被选为群众的代表。在这当中她更认识了共产党发展生产政策，常高兴的宣传，“今后不要紧垃；好好的安心生产吧！”
    过去魏家庄的妇女，除纺织外很少下地的。现在据调查该村十五岁至五十岁的妇女，共一百零九名，八个妇女会全套庄稼活，八十七个妇女参加田间主要劳动，只几个人不下地了。
    范长存的模范事迹传遍了各村，传到了远在石门的魏恒勋的耳朵里，他曾来信向范长存道歉。最近当县里干部去调查她的模范事迹时，该村年老的农民魏其玉带着荣幸和骄傲的神气说：“俺村这妇女劳动英雄，你走多少村找不到第二个，别看脚不大庄稼活可会哪！”瞎婆婆在炕上，矜夸而又感激的说：“俺这媳妇和别的可不同，要没她我也别说活到这，连灾荒年也过不来呀！”范长存的确是劳动妇女的一面旗帜，由她说明了妇女能独立的生产和发家致富，因此，她获得了南宫县委会、妇联会、县政府的联合通报表扬，以及全村群众的拥护和称赞。
