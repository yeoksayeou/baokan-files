　　A Record of the Soviet Construction Photo Exhibition
　　Lin Hong

    The Soviet Construction Photo Exhibition, organized by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, opened two days ago in Zhongshan Park. This historically significant event immediately garnered the attention of the broad masses of the people of Beiping, and thousands upon thousands of visitors are flocking to the entrance of the exhibition, all hoping to witness the achievements of the construction of the great socialist nation.

    The photos in the exhibition are neatly arranged in Zhongshan Hall. On the central wall hangs a banner that reads "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship," flanked by large red characters that read "Learn from the Soviet Union's experience in nation-building" and "Build a New Democratic China." The exhibition is divided into twelve parts. In the section on "Post-War Economic Recovery and Development," the most eye-catching is "The Rebirth of Donbas," which is the Soviet Union's most important coal mining and industrial area. During the Great Patriotic War, the industrial and mining constructions in this area were destroyed by the German fascist bandits. According to the photo captions, 314 mine shafts, over 10,000 factory buildings and equipment, and over 19,000 residential buildings were destroyed. They also looted 2,400 electric coal trucks and motorcycle coal trucks, 2,700 drilling machines, 5,000 thread-arranging machines, and 2,800 compressors and ventilators. However, through the vigorous Stakhanovite movement, the people of Donbas finally victoriously completed the post-war recovery work and greatly advanced their productive forces. Within three months of expelling the German bandits, they repaired and rebuilt two large blast furnaces, increasing to three after six months, and further reaching eleven after twelve months. The mining area in southern Donbas reached its pre-war production level in the third year of the post-war five-year plan, and completed the construction of over 3 million square meters of plazas and roads in the entire area, restoring 1,380 kilometers of underground tunnels, equivalent to the entire journey from Moscow to Warsaw. These images of countless rebuilt factories, large in scale and equipped with the latest machinery, will be a great encouragement to the Chinese people who are seeking nation-building experience! When you see miners riding elevators up and down coal mines in the photos, or using the latest coal mining machines, coal preparation machines, and coal conveying machines to work in the mines, you will feel the infinite power of the working people under the socialist system.

    The restoration and development of industrial equipment has greatly improved the lives of miners. From the photos, we see modern workers' residences, beautiful gardens, and comfortable restaurants; in their spare time, they can engage in recreational activities such as swimming, singing, watching plays, and playing ball games; if they get sick, they can go to the clinic for free treatment. In 1948, on Miners' Day, the miners received over 10,000 new homes.

    In the industry section, we see large-scale buildings and batches of excellent industrial products such as the Ural Machinery Plant, the Stalin Automobile Factory, the Krasno harvester factory, the Mikoyan Food Factory, and the largest project, the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station. Of particular interest are the rotary printing presses that print a million copies of newspapers per hour, the new high-speed oil trains, and the new waterless automatic locomotives. Every visitor lingers for a long time in front of these highly industrialized finished products.

    The photos of collective farms most strongly impress upon people that Soviet farmers have generally moved from backwardness and poverty to civilization and prosperity. In many collective farms, the lives of villagers are no different from those of city dwellers. The "Red October" collective farm in Chikota, Kirov Oblast, has a factory for manufacturing vegetable oil and oil cake, and it is electrified. The Zhulinskiy collective farm in Ukraine has implemented scientific aerial sowing. The Soviet Union's agricultural production processes, from cultivation to harvesting, have almost universally adopted machinery, making it the first country in the world to achieve the most complete industrialization of agriculture.

    Particularly appealing is the happy material and cultural life of the general population. Students' studies are closely integrated with factories and farms, and they regularly engage in various internships. Students at agricultural machinery specialized schools are testing net-grain combine harvesters, while some university students are studying models of the Moscow subway. Women in socialist countries have developed both intellectually and physically, and they hold various positions in state power, construction, cultural, and educational departments. In particular, the memorial statue of Danya, a female hero killed by the German bandits during the Great Patriotic War, demonstrates the heroic spirit of Soviet women. Children are the happiest generation in the Soviet Union. Two photos of Comrade Lenin guiding a girl to write and Comrade Stalin holding a boy fully demonstrate how much they are loved. In addition, there are many photos of famous operas and dances, which are greatly appreciated by people engaged in artistic work; the diagrams of the Soviet state organization are also very valuable materials, which are of great help to understanding the Soviet political structure.

    Every visitor who has seen these photos has the following sentence deeply imprinted in his heart: Learn from the Soviet Union!

　　记苏联建设图片展览会
    林洪
    中苏友好协会所举办的苏联建设图片展览会，两日前在中山公园揭幕了。这一有历史意义的行动，立刻受到了北平市广大人民的重视，成千成万的观众正陆续涌向展览会的大门，大家都希望一睹伟大的社会主义国家建设的成果。
    展览的照片井然有序地布满了中山堂，正中央的墙壁上，高挂着“中苏友好万岁”的标语，两旁分贴着“学习苏联建国经验”“建设新民主主义中国”的红色大字。展览内容共分十二部分，在“战后的经济恢复与发展”栏内，最引人注目的是“复兴中的顿巴斯”，它是苏联最重要的煤矿区和工业区。在卫国战争时期，该区被德国法西斯匪徒摧毁的工矿建设，根据图片的说明，有三百十四个矿井，一万余工厂的建筑物和设备，一万九千余所住宅；还掠走了两千四百辆电气运煤车及摩托运煤车，二千七百辆穿孔机，五千台排丝机和二千八百台压缩机和通风机。但是顿巴斯的人民经过轰轰烈烈的斯塔哈诺夫运动，终于胜利地完成了战后复兴工作，并大大地往前发展了生产力。在驱逐德寇三个月后，便修复和重建起两座大炼铁炉，六个月后增加到三座，十二个月后更达到了十一座。顿巴斯南部的矿产区，于战后五年计划的第三年即已达到战前的生产水准，并在全区完成了三百余万平方米的广场和道路建筑，恢复了一千三百八十公里的地下道，相当于从莫斯科到华沙的全部行程。这些重建起来的无数规模宏大、装有最新机器的工厂的图景，对于正在寻求建国经验的中国人民，将是一个很大的鼓励！当你从照片上看见矿工们坐着升降机，上下煤井，或使用着最新式的采煤机、选煤机和输煤机在矿山上工作时，你会感觉到社会主义制度下劳动人民的无限伟力。
    工业设备的恢复与发展，使矿工们的生活得到很大改善，从图片上，我们看见一幢一幢的近代化的工人住宅，优美的花园和舒适的餐厅；在工余之暇，并可从事游泳、歌唱、看戏和球赛等娱乐；生了病可以到医疗所免费诊治。一九四八年矿工节日，矿工们获得了一万余所新住屋。
    在工业栏内，我们看见乌拉尔机器工厂、斯大林汽车厂、克拉斯诺某地的收割机制造厂、米高阳食品工厂以及最大工程的聂伯河水电站等规模宏大的建筑物和成批优良的工业产品。特别让人感到兴趣的是每小时印刷百万份报纸的回转式印刷机、新型快速油列车和新式无水自动机关车，每一个观众在这些高度工业化的成品前，无不徘徊良久。
    集体农庄的照片，使人印象最强烈的是苏联农民已普遍从落后与贫穷走上文明与富裕的道路。有许多农庄里，乡村的生活与城市已经没有什么差别了。基洛夫州契霍塔地方的“红十月”集体农庄有制造植物油和油渣饼的制造厂，并已电气化。乌克兰竹林斯基的集体农庄已实行科学的空中播种。苏联的农业从耕耘到收割等生产过程，几乎已普遍采用机器，它是世界上第一个农业达到工业化最完善的国家。
    特别令人心响往之的是一般人民的物质与文化方面的幸福生活。学生们的学习，是和工厂、农庄紧密地结合着的，他们经常进行着各种实习。农业机械专门学校的学生试验净谷康拜因机的情况，有的大学生则在研究莫斯科地下铁道的模型。社会主义国家的妇女，智力体力都得到发展，她们在国家政权、建设事业和文化教育等部门中担任着各种工作，尤其是卫国战争时期被德寇杀害的女英雄丹娘的纪念像，表现了苏维埃妇女的英雄气慨。儿童在苏联是最幸福的一代，列宁同志正指导一位女孩写字、和斯大林同志抱着一位男孩的两张图片，充分证明了他们是如何地被抚爱着。此外还有许多名歌剧和名舞的照片，从事艺术工作的人都十分欣赏；苏联国家组织机构的图解更是十分珍贵的材料，对于了解苏联政的治结构有很大帮助。
    每一个参观者在看过这些图片后，在他的心里都深深地印着这样一句话：向苏联学习！
