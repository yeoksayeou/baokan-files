Youth Delegation at the National Border
Zi Gang

Welcome and Entrustment

The Chinese Democratic Youth Delegation set off a week ago, and at noon on the 28th, it will arrive in Manchuria, change to the Siberian train, and cross the border.

The grand farewells from the youth along the station made the delegation excited and grateful, and also made them feel the burden on their shoulders even more. Whether they were from the Party, government, military, youth organizations, or workers, friends, and students, they all pointed out in unison that the Chinese delegation's grand departure abroad was an honor created by the victorious progress of the Chinese People's Liberation War, an honor created by the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. They urged the delegates to learn the struggles and nation-building experience of the socialist country of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and to report back to the whole country.

In Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, Ang'angxi, and Zhalantun, the delegation received countless brilliant bouquets, and countless moving songs, applause, slogans, and cheers resounded through the large and small station platforms. The young people and children smiled with bright eyes and clapped their hands vigorously, as if to say, "Don't let us down!" At dinner in Shenyang, Comrade Li Fuchun said that we would be detained for half a month on our return to listen to our reports.

Railway engine workers also gave us unparalleled encouragement, with each route vying to use the best engine to transport us. By the time we reached Manchuria, we had used four engines. The first was the July 1st Commemoration, the second was the Harbin Youth, the third was the May 5th, and at Ang'angxi we changed to the No. 3005. In Ang'angxi, the model driver Comrade Fan Yong specifically stated: "We have selected the best No. 3005 to send you abroad, so that you can serve us when you go, and report back for us when you return, bringing our friendship to fraternal countries." The No. 3005 locomotive was driven by Fan Yong and was instrumental in transporting artillery shells during the liberation of the Northeast.

The drinking water problem for more than one hundred people was difficult on the special train. The stove had to cook rice. On the Ping-Ha Railway, the fire in the boiler room was used to boil water. When we arrived in Harbin, the comrades at the station discovered it and thought it was easy to catch fire, so they used the telephone to instruct the next station to prepare tea. At first, we thought it might not be possible, but we knew that from Harbin onwards, as long as we stopped, the railway workers' families would send large buckets of tea, which made us infinitely grateful.

Three Days in Harbin

Before leaving, Comrade Liao Chengzhi instructed us to complete the task of reorganizing the team and strengthening political study along the way. It was more difficult to implement this on the train, and we could only discuss some minor matters in life in groups. Reading documents and discussions were left to Harbin. We arrived in Harbin at 6:00 PM on the 24th, and a welcoming ceremony was held in the open space in front of the Soviet Red Army Monument at the station. The number of people was nearly 10,000. Who knew that such a welcoming ceremony would not count? It was announced on the spot that there would be a grand welcoming ceremony in Zhaolin Park on the afternoon of the 25th. The next day, another large-scale mass meeting was held, with about 30,000 workers and students and 20,000 ordinary people. The entire population of Harbin was only 800,000. There were many orchestras, Yangge dances, and choruses to help out at the meeting. The Harbin Workers' Art Training Class had been running for several months and had already composed 150 or 160 workers' songs. The program that night depicted workers stepping up production to support the front and liberating the whole of China. It was extraordinary. Our art troupe also answered with several programs.

On the afternoon of the 26th, our Blue Team and the Shen-Ha Joint Team played a friendly game of ball, ending with a score of 45 to 35, which was very harmonious.

On the evening of the 26th, a grand and lively evening party was held at the Railway Cultural Center. The hosts were the Songjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Songjiang Provincial People's Government, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Harbin Municipal People's Government, the Songjiang Provincial Preparatory Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League. There were also many Soviet citizens who participated in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association among the guests. Soviet friends said that the Soviet youth would warmly welcome us to exchange experiences in struggle, study, and construction, and everyone repeatedly toasted. The orchestra of the China Changchun Railway workers played "The Blue Danube," "Democratic China," and other songs. There were various games such as chess and poker on the lawn, and indoor dance steps swirled until after 11 o'clock before dispersing.

The delegation did not forget to study, and we also faced our work seriously. On the mornings of the 25th and 26th, we studied and discussed documents in groups: Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "On Internationalism and Nationalism," which were of great help to our trip and clarified many issues. The art troupe worked hard to rehearse, and they also practiced songs with the delegation.

The Ma Tie Jun Hotel where we stayed is now the municipal government guest house. It was temporarily established for the delegation. The Communist Youth League called on its members to be responsible for the reception. As a result, fifteen male and female students from the Municipal No. 2 Middle School volunteered to serve us, greeting us with tea, sweeping the rooms, which made everyone extremely uneasy. But this also shows the new labor point of view of the new education under the banner of New Democracy.

In the afternoons of the 25th and 26th, in addition to group meetings, the delegates had some free time to buy books and visit the Martyrs' Memorial Hall. Some went boating and swimming on the Songhua River. The beauty of Harbin is famous, but its simplicity can be proved by this small thing. Except for a few large barber shops, general barber shops even omit the hair dryer equipment, which is to save electricity. Ordinary merchants pay 3% of their monthly business tax and 30% of their net profit, without any additional levies. When merchants talk about it, they still remember the Soviet army. After 14 years of being occupied, the current people's government's administration is like entering heaven from hell.

Before the National Border

When the reporter is writing, there is only half a day's journey left to Manchuria. The climate is like late autumn. The fan has lost its value, and the members of the delegation put on everything to keep warm, but it is still not warm. However, the welcoming lines at each station along the way are so warm. The Ang'angxi station was welcomed by Chinese students, as well as Chinese and Soviet employees of the China Changchun Railway. They exchanged greetings with each other. We shouted "Long live!", and they shouted "Ura!". A Soviet child who had just learned to walk also waved to the delegation. Our deputy head of the delegation, secretary general, and delegation committee members accepted their bouquets. On the platforms of the stations from Harbin, you can see beautifully cultivated flowerbeds, which make people feel that flowers are also necessary for life during the journey.

When we arrived at Zhalantun, it was already 10:00 PM, but countless young people were still lined up to welcome us, including Mongolian youth from three banners. In the midst of the cold, the delegates got up in embarrassment to accept the warm singing, flower presentation, and speeches. Our deputy secretary-general, Comrade Keli Geng, spoke to them.

The reporter is writing while swaying in the dining car, listening to the master chef and waiters singing "Unity is Strength", "The East is Red" and other songs, while they are cutting and preparing the vegetables for tomorrow. They told me that they also visited the Martyrs' Memorial Hall yesterday, and felt so angry when they saw the heads of the three martyrs Yang Jingyu, Chen Hanzhang, and Wang Yachen. They wanted me to criticize the special train for areas that need improvement. They will return to Ping tomorrow and act as couriers for this manuscript. This is truly a new century. If there was also a Lu Bo who woke up from a dream, he would not recognize the new characters in this new society.

At 10:00 AM on the 28th, we arrived at Hailar Station, where local Communist Youth League representatives and troops warmly welcomed us. Soviet employees of the China Changchun Railway also participated. Their young workers' representatives wished us to complete the goal of uniting the democratic youth of the world to strive for lasting world peace. Mongolian young men and women were happy and healthy, shouting the slogan of Han-Mongolian unity to build a new China. They filled wine bottles with milk and gave them to the delegation.

A little after 1:00 PM, we arrived in Manchuria and were busy changing trains. Not much to record. The delegation bid farewell to their compatriots. We will complete our task carefully.
Twenty-eighth noon

    青年代表团在国门
    子冈
    欢迎与嘱托
    中国民主青年代表团启程一周了，二十八日晌午就可以到达满洲里，换上西伯利亚火车，跨出国门。
    沿站青年们的盛大欢送＠使代表团兴奋感谢，也更感觉出肩上的负荷来了。他们无论是党政军青年团体或是工友、同学，都众口一声地指出中国代表团如此浩浩荡荡地出国，是中国人民解放战争胜利进行所造成的荣誉，是中国共产党和毛主席的领导所造成的荣誉，要代表们好好去学习社会主义国家苏联和人民民主国家青年的斗争及建国经验，回来向全国报告。
    在沈阳、长春、哈尔滨、昂昂溪、扎兰屯，代表团接受了无数次的绚烂花束，无数支动人的歌曲、掌声口号欢呼响彻大大小小的车站月台，那些青年少年孩子们亮着眼睛欢笑，使劲拍手，就好象说：“不要辜负了我们的希望！”在沈阳吃晚饭，李富春同志说回来时要中途扣留我们半个月，听取我们的报告。
    铁路机工同志也给了我们无上的鼓舞，各路争着以最好的机头来运送我们。到满洲里为止，我们使用过四个机头了。第一个是七一纪念号，第二个是哈尔滨青年号，第三个是红五月号，到昂昂溪又换了三○○五号。在昂昂溪模范司机范永同志特地声明：“我们挑选了最好的三○○五号来送你们出国，为的是你们去为我们服务，回来时要替我们报告，把我们的友爱带给兄弟国家吧。”三○○五号机车就是范永驾驶，在解放东北时运送炮弹是有功的。
    一百多人的饮水问题在专车上感到困难。灶火要煮饭，平哈路上利用锅炉间的火煮水，到哈尔滨被站上同志们发现，认为容易起火，于是用电话沿站叮嘱下站给预备茶水。起初我们以为未必办得到，那知道哈尔滨以下各站，只要停车，铁路职工家属就给送来大桶大桶的茶水，使我们感激无涯。
    哈尔滨三日
    临行时廖承志同志曾嘱咐我们途中要完成修整队伍，加强政治学习的任务。在车上执行比较困难，只能分组讨论些生活上的细事，阅读文件和讨论就留在哈尔滨了。我们二十四日午后六时抵达哈尔滨，在车站空场苏联红军纪念塔前举行了欢迎会，人数也将近一万，谁知这样的欢迎会不能算数，当场宣布二十五日午后在兆麟公园还要有一个盛大的欢迎会，翌日果然又来了一个大规模的群众大会，约有工人学生三万，老百姓两万，哈尔滨全市人口也不过八十万。会上有不少管弦乐队、秧歌舞、合唱助兴，哈市的工人文艺训练班办了几个月，已经有工人作曲一百五六十支了，那天晚上的节目描绘工人加紧生产支前，解放全中国，精彩非凡。我们的文工团也答谢了几个节目。
    二十六日午后我们的蓝赛队和沈哈联合队作友谊比球，以四十五对三十五终场，十分和谐。
    二十六日晚上在铁路文化馆举行了一个盛大而活泼的晚会，主人有中共松江省委会、松江省人民政府、中共哈尔滨市委会、哈尔滨市人民政府、青年团松江省筹委会、青年团哈尔滨市委会。客人中也有不少参加中苏友好协会的苏侨，苏联朋友说苏联青年一定会热烈地欢迎我们去交换斗争、学习及建设的经验，大家一再干杯。中长铁路的职工管弦乐队奏了“蓝色的多瑙河”、“民主中国”等曲子，在草坪上有下棋打扑克等各种游戏，室内舞步回旋，玩到十一点多才散。
    代表团没有忘了学习，我们也严肃地面对着工作，二十五、六两日上午分组学习讨论文件：毛主席的“论人民民主专政”，和刘少奇同志的“论国际主义与民族主义”，对我们此行大有帮助，搞通了不少问题。文工团勤于排戏，他们又和代表团一道练歌子。
    我们住的马铁军旅馆如今是市府招待所，为代表团临时成立，青年团号召团员们来负责招待，结果市立二中十五位男女同学为我们义务服务，招呼茶水，洒扫房间，真使大家不安之至。但是由此也可以看出新民主主义旗帜下的新教育，有着新的劳动观点。
    二十五、六午后代表团除开小组会外，代表们有一段自由活动的时间，买书、参谒烈士馆。有的到松花江上划船游泳。哈尔滨城市的美丽是出名的，但其朴实由这件小事可以证明，除了几家大理发店外，一般理发店连吹风设备也免了，这是为了节约电力。普通商家每月纳营业税百分之三，纯益百分之三十，再无摊派，商民们谈起来犹对苏军念念不忘，沦陷十四年后，对今日人民政府的施政，比如由地狱进了天堂。
    国门之前
    记者执笔时离满洲里只剩半天路程了，气候已如深秋，扇子失去了价值，团员们把一切御寒之物披上了身犹不暖和。然而沿途各站的欢迎行列是多么热烈啊，昂昂溪站来欢迎的有中国学生，也有中长路苏籍男女职工，互相致辞，我们喊万岁，他们高呼乌拉。有一个才学步的苏联孩子也随同向代表团挥手相送，我们的副团长、秘书长、团委们接受了他们的花束。由哈尔滨过来的各站月台上都可以看到培养得漂亮得很的花畦，使人在旅途中感到花朵也是人生所必需的。
    到扎兰屯时已是夜十时了，但是无数青年仍然列队欢迎，其中有三个旗的蒙古青年，在寒气侵入中代表们狼狈起床，接受热诚的歌唱、献花、和讲演。我们的副秘书长克力更同志和他们讲了话。
    记者在餐车中晃荡执笔，听车上的大师傅和服务生们在高唱“团结就是力量”、“东方红”等歌曲，一面他们手中在切弄明天的菜蔬。他们向我谈论昨天他们也去参谒了烈士馆，看到杨靖宇、陈翰章、汪亚臣三位烈士的头颅感到多么愤怒，他们要我批评专车的应改善之处，他们马上回平，要为这稿子作信差。这真是一个新的世纪啊，如果也有一个吕伯大梦醒来，他会不认识这新社会里的新人物的。
    二十八日上午十时到海拉尔站，当地青年团代表及部队热烈欢迎，中长路苏联职工也参加的，他们的青年工人代表祝我们完成团结世界民主青年争取世界持久和平的目的。蒙古青年男女愉快而又健康，高呼汉蒙团结建设新中国的口号，他们用酒瓶装了牛奶，送给代表团。
    午后一点多，我们到了满洲里，忙于换车，不多记了，代表团同人向同胞们告别，我们将谨慎地来完成任务。      二十八日午
