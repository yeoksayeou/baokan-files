Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 19th: A unit of the People's Liberation Army's Second Field Army, in coordination with local troops in western Anhui, has achieved considerable success in suppressing bandits, gaining initial experience in bandit suppression in newly liberated areas. From late June to the end of July, the unit eliminated organized bandit groups in its assigned area, restored and established political power in some areas, and instilled in the broad masses the idea of uniting with the People's Liberation Army to defend their homes. At the beginning of this bandit suppression campaign, the unit conducted various educational and ideological preparations, explaining that suppressing bandits and consolidating the rear were as important as advancing forward, and correcting the tendency to underestimate bandit suppression due to unwillingness to fight small battles. It was explained that the success of bandit suppression should not only be judged by the number of prisoners captured and materials seized, but also by how many people were liberated and how much suffering was alleviated, overcoming the psychology of underestimating achievements and perfunctorily fulfilling tasks. During the education, it was repeatedly emphasized that bandit suppression was not just a military issue, but primarily a political and disciplinary issue. In suppressing bandits, the unit correctly implemented the policy of "punishing the ringleaders severely, pardoning the coerced, and rewarding those who perform meritorious service," and adopted the following measures:

　　I. Convene mass meetings, meetings of bandit family members, and landlord meetings to actively publicize policies and expose various rumors spread by bandits and secret agents. At the same time, strike at the ringleaders to stabilize the emotions of people from all walks of life.

　　II. Promulgate bandit suppression rules and strengthen troop discipline. Stipulate that it is forbidden to fire guns without reason, threaten or beat the masses; advocate five "don't be afraid": "Don't be afraid of missing the target, don't be afraid of climbing mountains, don't be afraid of rain, don't be afraid of walking at night, don't be afraid of hardship."

　　III. Help the masses with production labor, such as carrying water, grinding flour, chopping firewood, weeding, accumulating manure, and plowing the land. Because the unit conscientiously carried out this work, the villagers who had been deceived and coerced by the bandits to hide in the mountains quickly dispelled their doubts, were deeply moved, returned home one after another, and frequently reported bandit activities to the troops.

　　IV. Establish district and township guerrilla teams and work teams to vigorously help local areas carry out mass work, and strictly distinguish between various elements among the bandits and treat them differently.

　　V. When going deep into bandit-infested areas, do not raise food locally to reduce the burden on the local people.

　　VI. Focus on clearing household registrations. At the same time, use actual examples to publicize the lenient policy and strive for bandits to confess their crimes, repent, register, and start anew.

　　VII. Combine political offensives with large-scale surprise attacks and pursuits by the main force. It is necessary to truly ensure that "where the army goes, the Party's policies go." In combat, carefully study the characteristics of bandit activities, use dispersion against dispersion, concealment against concealment, and hilltops against hilltops. At the same time, pay attention to overcoming the guerrilla habits that may develop in the unit during dispersed bandit suppression; promote regularization, strengthen discipline, and combine bandit suppression with military training.

　　第二野战军某部
  　剿匪经验
    【新华社南京十九日电】人民解放军第二野战军某部，协同皖西地方部队清剿土匪，获得不少成绩，取得了新区剿匪的初步经验。该部自六月下旬起至七月底月余时间内，消灭了该部清剿区的成股土匪，恢复与建立了部分地区的政权工作，并在广大群众中树立了与解放军团结一起进行防匪保家的思想。此次剿匪开始时，该部曾进行了各种教育及思想准备，说明清剿土匪、巩固后方与向前进军同等重要，纠正不愿打小仗的轻视剿匪观点；说明剿匪的成绩不能仅看俘虏缴获多少，还要看解放了多少人民，解除了多少人民痛苦，克服对成绩估计不足，对任务马虎敷衍的心理。在教育中并反复说明剿匪不仅是军事问题，而主要地是政治与纪律问题。在剿匪中，该部正确执行了“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”的政策，并采取了以下各项办法：
    一、召开群众会、土匪家属会、房东会、积极宣传政策，揭发土匪特务的各种造谣。同时，打击首恶分子，以安定社会各阶层人民的情绪。
    二、颁布剿匪守则，加强部队纪律。规定不准无故放枪，威胁或打骂群众；提倡五不怕：“不怕扑空，不怕爬山，不怕下雨，不怕走夜路，不怕吃苦”。
    三、帮助群众生产劳动，如担水、推磨、劈柴、拔草、积粪、耕地等。由于该部切实进行了这一工作，使被匪欺骗胁迫躲到山上的老乡们迅速消释疑虑，深受感动，纷纷回家，并经常向部队报告匪情。
    四、建立区乡游击队和武工队，大力帮助地方开展群众工作，并严格区别土匪中各种分子，分别对待。
    五、在深入匪患区时，不就地筹粮，以减轻当地人民负担。
    六、有重点地清查户口。同时以实际的事例，宣传宽大政策，争取土匪坦白悔过，登记自新。
    七、政治攻势结合大部队的广泛的奔袭追剿。要真正作到“军队到哪里，当的政策到哪里”。在作战中要细心研究土匪活动的特点，以分散对分散，以隐蔽对隐蔽，以山头对山头。同时要注意克服部队在分散剿匪中可能增长的游击习气；提倡正规化，加强纪律性，并使剿匪与练兵相结合。
