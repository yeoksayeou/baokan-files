Current Practices in Film Art
Shi Dongshan

Chairman Mao recently instructed us to make every effort to restore and develop economic and cultural construction. In the past, during the period of encircling the cities from the countryside, our cultural troops, like our armed forces, had to fight with light weapons. Now that we have conquered the cities and are about to achieve national victory, and since we have acquired modern mechanized weapons, we should strengthen the use of film, this mechanized weapon, to undertake the propaganda and education work in the vast areas of China in the future. Lenin once famously said, "Of all the arts, film is the most important to us." This is what he was referring to. At the opening of the Cultural Congress, Minister Lu Dingyi also mentioned, "China is such a large place that the existing theatrical troupes are not enough to be distributed." Yes, for a China with a population of 475 million, it is essential to strengthen the use of film, this mechanized weapon, in propaganda and education work. Stage art, with its easily accessible tools, is convenient for quickly reflecting current reality and is suitable for the characteristics of a particular place; film art, with its heavy tools but powerful strength, is convenient for wide dissemination and is suitable for expressing themes with universality. Therefore, when the struggle is fierce and the reality changes quickly, it is advisable to use the stage more; and when the country is unified and needs to carry out national construction work in a planned way, it is advisable to use film more. If we make an overall and regular calculation, film is even more economical than stage. Except for a few parts, China can manufacture its own projection equipment, but it will take some time to mass-produce it and popularize film in the countryside and the army.

The propaganda and education of art must identify the target and provide the most appropriate materials. Film, in the short term, can only slightly focus on activities in the cities, so what should its task be at present? Under the working principle of implementing urban leadership in rural areas, its responsibility is not light. The Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC called for "making great efforts to learn to lead the urban people in their victorious struggle" and "striving to get as many petty bourgeois and national bourgeois who can cooperate with the Communist Party to stand on the same front." Chairman Mao also pointed out that after the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, "They will not be reconciled to their failure on this land, and they will collude with each other and oppose the Chinese people in every possible way." It is generally believed that most of the enemies without guns will lurk in the cities. To lead the urban people to carry out a victorious struggle against the enemy and to win over as many people as possible who can cooperate with us to stand on the same line, it is necessary to rely on film, which has the strongest expressive power and is therefore the most persuasive and the most popular among the urban people, to assume more responsibility in propaganda and education.

Work can and should be divided into different positions and responsibilities, as Comrade Li Fuchun said at the "July 1st" cadre commemoration meeting in Shenyang: "We now have both rural and urban areas, both agriculture and industry, both donkeys and railways, both inland trade and foreign trade. There are more friends in class relations, and the internal and external situations are more complex, and the forms of class struggle are more diverse. In short, the situation is complex, so not only policies become complex, but also work becomes complex. Our work cannot be like in the countryside, 'one-size-fits-all,' doing only one thing at a time, and relaxing on other things. Now, we must have a comprehensive cooperation with emphasis, like playing the piano, with ten fingers coordinating the action with different emphasis, rather than playing with only one finger." At present, film can take on more responsibility for propaganda and education work in the cities. Of course, we should not forget to use the lives and great struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers to educate urban audiences, but in addition, in today's cities, there is also the work of distinguishing between enemies and friends, between truth and falsehood, between good and evil, and between beauty and ugliness in complex, even subtle realities. The best way to carry out this work is to "prescribe the right medicine for the disease." In today's situation, serving workers, peasants, and soldiers through literature and art should first start from the demand of "safeguarding the interests of workers, peasants, and soldiers." Reflecting the lives and great struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers is also aimed at making people understand them, truly recognize them, and sincerely stand with them. If we understand "literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers" as merely praising them, that would be too simplistic and narrow. Comrade Chen Boda said well at the Cultural Congress: "After the national victory, the tasks of literary and art workers are even greater. All aspects of the country's work require the help of literary and art workers. Since literary and art workers are engineers of the human mind, they should be able to discover problems and raise problems from reality... We should praise the people and the proletariat, but praising merits is not flattery." That's right, serving workers, peasants, and soldiers should be based on the perspective of "the interests of workers, peasants, and soldiers" in everything. Comrade Chen Boda also said that day: "It is not enough for literary and art workers to only study Chairman Mao's speech at the forum on literature and art. They must understand the entirety of Mao Zedong Thought in order to see the correct direction." This is the most pertinent remark for our literary and art workers. According to the principle of an instruction, our workers should know how to flexibly apply this principle in various situations. Vice Chairman Zhou said at the Cultural Congress: "The combination of principle and flexibility can vividly and deeply address all issues... Theory leads practice, and practice in turn develops theory." This is the same principle as the fact that Marxism was not applied in exactly the same way in early Russia as it is in today's China. What Comrade Chen Boda called "engineers of the human mind should be able to discover problems and raise problems" is of course not limited to the problems of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Wherever there is a place that has an important relationship with the interests of workers, peasants, and soldiers, that is where the problem lies, that is the theme that our literary and art workers should pay attention to and study. The so-called "art is a reflection of reality" is not just a portrayal of some heroic figures in reality. "The writer cannot be the tail of events, he should march in the advanced ranks of the people, pointing out the path of development to the people." (Zhdanov) The most important work and responsibility of artists lies in extracting problems from many phenomena, making artistic processing, turning them into artworks, reflecting them, and agitating and educating the masses to solve these problems. The purpose of praising heroes and models in revolutionary struggles or production construction is also to encourage everyone to learn from him or her and solve problems together. Praise is not only to record merit, so it is not flattery. In the current situation, we first need to fight for the interests of workers, peasants, and soldiers in many aspects, and we must take "safeguarding the interests of workers, peasants, and soldiers" as the major premise to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers with literature and art. This is the most loyal service of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Under this major premise, you can "be clear in your mind" about when, in what kind of real situation, you should write something, and coordinate with the work of your comrades, just like the mutual coordination in military tactics. Under this major premise, we will also feel that the scope of writing and expression is broadened, diversified, and lively, because in reality, such struggles are also diversified. On one hand, it is to protect the interests of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and on the other hand, it is to destroy the interests of workers, peasants, and soldiers; or on one hand, it is to care about the interests of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and on the other hand, it is to ignore the interests of workers, peasants, and soldiers. There are all kinds of struggles and conflicts in between, so we can write stories about how heroes or good people in factories, rural areas, battlefields, and cities struggle with bad people or so-called villains who destroy the interests of workers, peasants, and soldiers. On such themes, you can use any form to express it. If the audience likes to see a big fight, we can have a big fight; if the audience likes to see stage machinery, we can use some stage machinery; if the audience likes to see the depiction of family daily life, we can reflect the struggle in family daily life; if the audience likes to see some gags or likes the form of comic plays (so-called farces), we can arrange one or two characters in the story who are not inherently bad, want to be good people, but have too many shortcomings in their habits and cannot change them for a while, or other ridiculous characters, or even write comic plays with such comic characters. We can even write stories about the combination of love and revolution, where the two mutually increase their passion. In short, as long as we can grasp the task, grasp the theme, and truthfully and deeply express the temperament, character, and even form of new social figures or new heroes, and sweep away the bad habit of some old-fashioned workers who uncritically imitate everything from foreign films as soon as they start making films, then we can use any "form of expression." In the artistic form of expression, we must make it very diverse and lively so that the audience is willing and never tired of accepting our content. The audience's boredom with our artistic form of expression is not only a loss to our art, but also a serious loss to the revolution, because our art is to serve the revolution, and at the same time, it is economically required to be as self-reliant as possible, and the two can be unified, and should be unified. In the process of national construction, especially in the current situation, if this economic requirement can be unified with the artistic requirement, we cannot and should not ignore it. Even if we are simply talking about the requirements of artistic propaganda, we must strive for the maximum number of audiences (the so-called "maximum number" of course refers to the range that film can spread to at any time), as long as we do not cater to the audience's corrupt old ideas in the content of art; and do not cater to the audience's low tastes in the form of art. The so-called "low tastes" should of course not be those appropriately used in the plot of big fights, stage machinery, comic characters, love states, etc., but should refer to those that reflect backward ideological emotions, have no proper content, are empty, purely gag, pornographic, and feudal tastes, etc.

I always hope that our films will be made more lively and not too restrained. An overly restrained approach will gradually bore the audience who are accustomed to the diverse forms of film expression, which means that we are not taking good care of our work, and at the same time, we cannot make this powerful weapon of film exert its due power.

    目前电影艺术的作法
    史东山
    毛主席最近曾经指示我们要用全力恢复并发展经济建设和文化建设。过去，我们在以农村包围城市的时期，文化部队和武装部队一样，不得不利用轻便的武器来作战，现在我们既然攻克了城市，行将取得全国的胜利，而我们既然已经获得了近代机械化的武器，那么，今后我们要担负全中国广大地区的宣传教育工作，也就应该加强利用电影这机械化的武器了。列宁曾经有过一句名言，说：“在所有的艺术中，电影对我们最为重要”。就是指着这种情况说的。文化大会开幕的那一天，陆定一部长也曾经提起：“中国那么大地方，现有的戏剧团队是不够分配的”。是的，一个四亿七千五百万人口的中国，在宣教工作上，是不可不加强利用电影这机械化武器的。舞台艺术以其工具的轻而易举而便于迅速反映当前现实，并适用于某一地方的特性；电影艺术则以其工具笨重，但力量强大，便于广泛传播并宜于表现具有普遍性的主题。所以在斗争激烈，现实情况变化快的时候，宜多利用舞台，而在国家统一，需要有计划地展开全国建设工作的时候，宜多利用电影。如果要作全盘及经常的计算，电影比舞台还要经济一点。放映机件，除一二零件外，中国自己也能制造，只是要大量生产，把电影普遍地推广到农村和军队中去，还需要些时间。
      ×      ×      ×
    艺术的宣传教育，必须认定对象，而给予最适当的材料，而电影在短期内大致只能稍稍偏重于城市里的活动，那么，它在目前的任务应该是什么呢？在要贯彻城市领导乡村的工作方针之下，它的责任是不轻的。中共二中全会号召：“必须用极大的努力去学会领导城市人民进行胜利的斗争”，并“争取尽可能多的能够和共产党合作的小资产阶级和民族资产阶级站到一条战线上来”。毛主席也曾指出：拿枪的敌人消灭了以后，不拿枪的敌人还存在，“他们在这块土地上的失败是不会甘心的，他们会互相勾结在一起，用各种可能的方法反对中国人民”。一般人相信不拿枪的敌人大部分会潜伏在城市里，要城市人民对敌人进行胜利的斗争，并争取尽可能多的能够和我们合作的人站到一条线上来，在这里，就需要那表现力最强，因之是说服力最强的，且为城市人民最喜欢看的电影来在宣传教育上担负比较多的责任。
    工作是可以，也应该分别岗位来负责的，正如李富春同志在沈阳“七一”干部纪念大会上讲话中所说的：“我们现在有乡村有城市，有农业也有工业，有毛驴也有铁路，有内地商业也有对外贸易，在阶级关系上朋友多了，内部、外部的情况复杂了，阶级斗争的形式多样性了，总之，情况复杂了，所以不仅政策随之复杂，工作也随之复杂了。我们的工作不能象在农村那样，‘一揽子’，一个时期只搞一件事，其他可以放松。现在，必须是要有重点的全面配合，象弹钢琴那样，十个指头轻重缓急协同动作，而不是只用一个指头弹”，在目前，城市里的宣教工作，是可以让电影多负些责任的。当然，我们不应该忘记拿反映工农兵的生活及其伟大的各种斗争事迹来宣传，借以教育城市观众，但除此之外，在今天的城市里，还有在复杂，甚至是微妙的现实中区别敌友，区别真伪，区别善恶，区别美丑的工作，而要从事这种工作，最好的方法是“对症下药”。在今天这样的现实情势中，文艺为工农兵服务，应该首先从“保卫工农兵的利益”的要求上出发。反映工农兵的生活及其伟大的斗争事迹，目的也还是要使人们了解工农兵，真正认识工农兵，而诚心诚意地和他们站在一边来。假如我们把“文艺为工农兵服务”理解为止于歌颂他们，那未免是太简单狭隘了。陈伯达同志在文代大会上说得好，他说：“全国胜利以后，文艺工作者的任务更大了，全国各方面的工作，都要求文艺工作者的帮助。文艺工作者既然是人类心灵的工程师，就应该能够从现实中发现问题，提出问题……我们应该歌颂人民，歌颂无产阶级，但歌颂功德并不是谄媚。”一点不错的，为工农兵服务，应该一切在“工农兵底利益”的观点上去打算。陈伯达同志那天又说：“文艺工作者仅研究毛主席在文艺座谈会上的讲话是不够的，必须了解毛泽东思想的全部，才能看到正确的方向。”这是对于我们文艺工作者最为中肯的话。根据一个指示的原则，我们工作者应该懂得在各种不同的情况之下灵活地来运用这个原则。周副主席在文代大会上说过：“原则性与灵活性相结合地运用，才能活泼而深入一切问题……理论领导了实践，而实践又反过来发展了理论”，这与马克思主义在当初俄国的运用，和在今天中国的运用不尽相同是一样的道理。陈伯达同志所谓之“人类心灵的工程师应该能够从现实中发现问题，提出问题”，当然是不限于工农兵之中的问题，凡是与工农兵的利益有重要关系的地方，就是问题所在的地方，就是我们文艺工作者应该加以注意，加以研究的主题。所谓“艺术是现实的反映”，并不就是现实中若干英雄人物的写照而已。“作家不能作事变的尾巴，他应当在人民先进的行列中行进，给人民指出发展的道路。”（日丹诺夫）艺术家最重要的工作和责任在于从许多现象中抽出问题来，作艺术的加工，把它作成艺术品表现出来，反映出来，扇动并教育群众去解决这问题。其所以要歌颂革命斗争或生产建设中的英雄模范，目的也还是要大家向他或她学习，共同来解决问题。歌颂不仅是要记功，所以不就是谄媚。在当前现实情势中，我们首先需要在多方面为工农兵的利益而斗争，要以“保卫工农兵的利益”为大前提，来用文艺为工农兵服务，这才是工农兵底最忠实的勤务员。在这大前提之下，你才能“心中有数”地把握——在什么时候，在怎样的现实情势中，应该写什么东西，并和战友们的工作互相配合，象军事战术上的互相配合一样；在这大前提之下，我们对于写作和表现的范围也会觉得宽广起来，而且多样性起来，也活泼起来，因为在现实中，这样的斗争也多样性了，一面是要保卫工农兵的利益，一面是要破坏工农兵的利益；或者一面是关心工农兵的利益，而一面是漠视工农兵的利益，其间有种种的斗争冲突，于是我们就可以写作在工厂、农村、战场以及城市中一切为保卫工农兵利益的英雄或好人如何跟破坏工农兵利益的坏人或所谓反派角色斗争的种种故事，而在这样的主题上，你用任何形式来表现都可以，观众喜欢看大打出手，我们就无妨大打出手一下；观众喜欢看机关布景，我们也无妨用些机关布景；观众喜欢看家庭日常生活的描写，我们也无妨就在家庭日常生活中反映斗争；观众喜欢看看噱头之类的穿插或喜欢趣剧的形式（所谓滑稽戏），我们也无妨在故事中安排一二个本性不坏，想做好人，但习惯上缺点太多，一时改不过来或其他可笑的人物在内，或者根本用这类滑稽角色写成趣剧，甚至我们也无妨来写写恋爱与革命相结合，两者互增热力的故事，总之，只要我们能抓紧任务，把握主题，并真实而深入地表现新社会人物或新英雄的气质、品格以至型态，一扫过去有部分旧式的工作者一动手搞电影就会无批判地向外国电影模仿一切的陋习，那么我们是任何“表现形式”都可以利用的。在艺术的表现形式上，我们必须搞得十分多样性而活泼，才能使观众乐意而始终不厌倦地来接受我们的内容。观众对于我们底艺术表现形式厌倦，不仅是我们艺术上的损失，而且是革命的严重损失，因为我们的艺术是要为革命服务的，何况同时在经济上还要求它尽可能自力更生，而这两者是可以统一做到的，也应该做到统一的。在国家建设的过程中，特别在目前的形势中，这种经济上的要求，如果可与艺术上的要求统一的，我们便不可以，也不应该忽视的。我们即使单纯在艺术宣传的要求上来说，也是必须争取最大限度的观众（所谓“最大限度”当然是随时依电影所能传播到的范围而言），只要我们在艺术的内容上不迁就观众的腐旧思想；在艺术的形式上不迁就观众的低级趣味。所谓“低级趣味”当然不应该是那些适当地运用在剧情中的大打出手、机关布景、滑稽角色、恋爱状态等等，而应该是指那些反映落后思想情绪的，无正当内容的，空洞的，纯噱头的，色情的以及封建性趣味等等。
    我总希望我们的电影要作得活泼些，不要过于拘谨了。过分拘谨的作法，会使向来习惯于多样性电影表现形式的观众日渐厌倦，那就是我们在工作上的照顾不周，同时我们就不能使电影这强有力的武器发挥它应有的威力。
