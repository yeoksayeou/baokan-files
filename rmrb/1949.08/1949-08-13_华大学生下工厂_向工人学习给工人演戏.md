    Hua University Students Go to Factories to Learn from Workers and Perform for Workers
    [Our Newspaper] Since the conclusion of the first phase of political study at the Third Division of Hua North University last month, and on the basis of the general improvement of students' political understanding, business studies have now officially begun. After more than a week of preparation, it was decided that the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Teams of the Performing Arts Troupe would go to factories in Tianjin, Changxindian, and Shijingshan respectively today (the 13th) and tomorrow to intern, arrange various professional studies according to the requirements of the workers, understand the factory situation, experience the life of the workers, and carry out creative work in a planned way. They also plan to perform dramas and songs such as "Red Flag Song," "Three Loads of Water," "Unite and Advance," and "Offering Flowers" in various factories and coal mines to inspire workers to create together and learn from each other.
