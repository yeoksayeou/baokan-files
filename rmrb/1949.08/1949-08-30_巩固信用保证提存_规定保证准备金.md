　　Consolidate Credit, Guarantee Deposits
  　Stipulate Guarantee Reserves
    Deposits received should be deposited as cash guarantee reserves in the local or nearest People's Bank of China. The amount of the reserve shall be adjusted according to the average weekly deposit balance at a rate of 7 to 15 percent for current deposits and 3 to 8 percent for fixed deposits. The People's Bank of China may increase or decrease this ratio at any time within the above range depending on the financial situation. The minimum ratio of cash reserve for deposits shall be 10 percent for current deposits and 5 percent for fixed deposits. As for deposit and loan interest rates, they shall be formulated by the Banking Association based on local market conditions and submitted to the local People's Bank of China for approval. In addition, the measures contain detailed provisions on the registration, suspension, reorganization or increase or decrease of capital and debt, business reports, and illegal penalties of private banks and money shops.

    Simultaneous with the promulgation of this measure, the Liberation Daily, the organ of the CCP Central Committee East China Bureau and the CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee, published an editorial entitled "The Transformation of Private Banks and Money Shops," which pointed out: This measure requires private banks and money shops to serve the development of production under the leadership of the people's government. The use of their funds should be limited to production undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and the marketing of necessities for urban and rural people, and any speculation or reliance on speculators that violates the interests of the people is strictly prohibited. This is the direction of private banks and money shops in a new democratic society, and it is precisely the basic spirit of this interim measure. This is in line with the general policy of crushing the enemy's blockade and fighting for the construction of a new Shanghai.

　　巩固信用保证提存
  　规定保证准备金
    所收存款应以现金缴存保证准备金于当地或就近之中国人民银行。其准备金数额依每周存款平均余额按活期百分之七至十五，及定期百分之三至八的比率调整，此项比率中国人民银行得视金融情况在上述幅度内随时增减之。对存款应提存之付现准备金，其最低比率为活期百分之十，定期百分之五。至于存放款利率，则由银钱业公会视当地市场情况拟订呈请当地中国人民银行核定之。此外该办法对私营银钱业之登记、停业、改组或增减资本、债务、营业报告、违法处分等均有详尽规定。
    与公布此一办法同时，中共中央华东局和中共上海市委机关报解放日报特发表题为“私营银钱业的改造”的社论指出：该办法要求私营银钱业，在人民政府的领导下去为发展生产服务。其资金运用应限于有利于国计民生的生产事业及城乡人民必需品之运销事业，绝对禁止任何投机或依靠投机者的违反人民利益的行为。这就是私营银钱业在新民主主义社会中的方向，也正是这个暂行办法的基本精神。这是符合于目前粉碎敌人封锁为建设新上海而斗争的总方针的。
