Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 3rd: More than 60,000 workers in Wuhan have begun to organize themselves to restore and develop production and construction. After the liberation of Wuhan, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent more than 400 cadres to form working groups to conduct organizational and educational work among workers in 47 enterprises. Soon, the Preparatory Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions was also announced. Currently, more than 30 state-owned and private factories in the city have established workers' representative conferences or preparatory committees for trade unions. Since the liberation of Wuhan, under the propaganda and education of the working groups, the workers of each factory have actively assisted in the takeover, inventory, and restoration of production. The workers of the Wuhan Telecommunications Administration assisted the military control commission in identifying 379 types of materials and more than 800 pieces of furniture that were not accounted for, and reported those who concealed equipment, prompting former supervisors of many units to submit supplementary forms. The workers of the Pinghan Railway also assisted the takeover personnel in identifying 12 motorcycles and a large number of motors, tires, and other equipment that had not been handed over. The leading role of workers in the restoration of production is also very significant. Workers in state-owned Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company and Hubei Machinery Factory and other units elected representatives to directly participate in production management. Workers at the steelmaking plant of the Central China Iron and Steel Company have voluntarily established new labor discipline, such as going to and from work on time, actively producing, saving, studying, and paying attention to fire prevention, anti-espionage, and protecting factory safety. The ideological deviation of some workers in the early period after liberation, "We are liberated, no one can control us," has been initially overcome. The output of each factory, except for a few factories that have temporarily reduced production due to difficulties in selling finished products, the output of some factories has increased compared to before liberation. Workers in private factories also actively assisted the capitalists in resuming work. By mid-June, 26 private factories had successively resumed production.

After carrying out learning movements more universally, the political awareness of the workers in each factory has been improved, thus creating a favorable foundation for the restoration of production. Up to now, 29 factories have established learning organizations, and night schools, rotational training classes, etc. have also been held. The Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also held large-scale spare-time lectures for workers, inviting responsible personnel from various leading organs to make special reports. The "Central China Worker" newspaper, a tri-weekly publication sponsored by the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, is now the main reading material for workers in Wuhan, with a circulation of more than 7,000 copies. In order to further guarantee the lives of workers, the Preparatory Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has established the Municipal Workers' Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Society. In addition to planning to establish 16 branches, the society will assist enterprises in establishing cooperatives.

    武汉六万职工积极从事生产
    【新华社汉口三日电】武汉市六万多职工，已开始组织起来，从事恢复和发展生产建设。武汉解放后，中共武汉市委会及华中职工总会筹备会曾派出四百多名干部组成工作组，到四十七个企业单位进行组织和教育职工的工作；不久武汉市职工总会筹备会亦宣告成立。现全市已有三十多个公私营工厂成立了职工代表会或职工会筹备会。武汉解放以来，各厂职工在工作组的宣传教育下，即积极协助接管清点及恢复生产。武汉电讯管理局职工曾协助军管会接收人员清查出漏在帐外的三百七十九种材料及八百多件家具，并检举告发隐藏器材者，促使许多单位的旧有主管人呈送补还表册。平汉路职工亦协助接管人员清查出未交的十二辆摩托卡及大批马达、轮胎等器材。工人们在恢复生产中的带头作用也是很显著的。公营南洋兄弟烟草公司及湖北机械厂等单位职工们并选出代表，直接参加了生产管理。华中钢铁公司炼钢厂职工自动订出了新的劳动纪律，如按时上下班，积极生产、节约、学习以及注意防火反特保护工厂安全等。解放后最初时期部分职工存在的“我们解放了，谁也管不了我们”的思想偏向，已被初步克服。各厂产量，除几个厂因成品销路困难而暂时缩减生产外，某些工厂的产量较解放前增加。私营工厂的职工亦积极协助资方复工，到六月中旬，已有二十六个私营工厂先后恢复生产。
    在较普遍地开展学习运动后，各厂职工的政治觉悟均有提高，因而给恢复生产造成了有利基础。迄今有二十九个工厂已建立了学习组织，另外还举办夜校、轮训班等。市职工总会筹备会也举办了大型的职工业余讲座，聘请各领导机关负责人员作专题报告，华中职工总会筹备会主办的“华中工人”报三日刊，现在是武汉工人的主要读物，发行达七千余份。武汉市职工总会筹备会为进一步保障职工生活，已设立了市职工供销合作总社。该社除计划筹办十六个分社外，将协助各企业单位设立合作社。
