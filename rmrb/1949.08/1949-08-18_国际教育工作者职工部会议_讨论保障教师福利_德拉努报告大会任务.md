Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 17th. Warsaw dispatch: The International Federation of Teachers' Unions Conference, first day (12th). The Secretary-General of the Federation, Delanu, gave a report. Delanu stated: This conference is the fourth meeting of the Teachers' Union Federation's campaign and is the first official gathering as an international department of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

Delanu first compared the educational conditions in people's democratic countries with those in capitalist countries and colonies. Then, he explained the relationship between the International Federation of Teachers' Unions and the World Federation of Trade Unions, saying: Despite the sabotage of some reactionary trade union leaders, this department was still able to join the World Federation of Trade Unions. This conference must decide what concrete measures the World Federation of Teachers' Unions will take to defend peace and participate in the organizational work of commemorating the International Day for the Struggle to Defend Peace as decided by the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress.

Delanu further pointed out: Teachers all over the world are looking forward to this conference. They expect the conference to create conditions that guarantee the welfare of teachers, so that they can devote all their energy to education. They expect the conference to set salary standards. They expect the conference to make decisions to eliminate all discrimination and provide the prerequisites for continuously increasing their knowledge. Teachers in all countries hope to increase the number of schools so that all children can attend school. Textbooks and publications for the younger generation should be cleared of all poisons that spread fascism, racial discrimination, and other things that may undermine peace and friendship among all peoples. At the same time, they hope that educators can work according to their abilities and expertise and have the right to pursue advanced studies and university education. Delanu continued, we are fully aware that in order to achieve our goals, we cannot exist in isolation. We must unite regardless of race, religion, or political belief. We already feel that we have been strengthened by the support of the World Federation of Trade Unions and its more than 70 million members.

　　国际教育工作者职工部会议
    讨论保障教师福利
  　德拉努报告大会任务
    【新华社北平十七日电】华沙讯：世界工联国际教育工作者职工部会议第一日（十二日）。该部秘书长德拉努作报告。德拉努称：这次会议，是教育工作者职工会联合会战役的第四次会议，并且是作为世界工联国际职工部的第一次正式集会。
    德拉努首先把人民民主国家和资本主义国家及殖民地的教育状况作了对比，继即说明国际教育工作者职工部与世界工联的关系称：尽管有若干反动的职工会领袖的破坏，可是本职工部仍能继续加入世界工联。这次会议必须决定世界教育工作者职工部将采取什么具体措施来保卫和平，并参加世界工联大会所决定的纪念国际保卫和平斗争日的组织工作。
    德拉努进一步指出：全世界的教师都翘首望着这个会议。他们期望会议创立保证教师福利的条件，使他们能以全副精力从事教育工作，他们期望会议订出薪金标准，他们期望会议作出消除一切歧视的决定，并提供不断增进他们的知识的前提。一切国家的教师都希望能增设学校，使所有的儿童都能上学。为青年一代出版的教科书与出版物应清除一切传播法西斯主义、种族歧视及其他可能破坏和平与各族人民友谊的毒素。同时，他们希望教育工作者能按其能力与专长进行工作，并能获得深造与受大学教育的权利。德拉努继称，我们充分认识到：要想达到我们的目的，我们便不能孤立地生存着。我们必须不分种族、宗教、政治信仰，团结一致。我们已经觉得，我们已由于世界工联及其七千余万会员的支持而增强了。
