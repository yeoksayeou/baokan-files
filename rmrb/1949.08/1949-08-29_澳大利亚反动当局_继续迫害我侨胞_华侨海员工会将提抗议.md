    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 28th] TASS, Sydney, August 26th: Racial discrimination continues to run rampant in Australia. Immigration authorities are arresting and deporting citizens of Asian countries. Immigration officials searched Chinese residences in Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide this week. They arrested thirty-four people and detained them prior to deportation. The arrests have aroused the indignation of all progressive Australians. The Overseas Chinese Seamen's Union in Australia will issue a statement condemning the racial discrimination against citizens of Asian countries and protesting the arrests. The families of the Overseas Chinese seamen have decided to request the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to intervene and stop the expulsion of their husbands from Australia.

    【新华社北平二十八日电】塔斯社悉尼二十六日讯：种族歧视在澳大利亚继续猖獗着。移民当局正逮捕和放逐亚洲国家的公民。移民当局的官员本周搜查了悉尼、墨尔本及阿得雷德的中国人住宅。他们逮捕了三十四人并于放逐前将后者拘禁。逮捕事件已引起所有进步澳大利亚人士的愤慨。在澳华侨海员工会将发表声明，谴责对亚洲各国公民实施的种族歧视，并抗议逮捕。华侨海员的家属们决定要求联合国人权委员会出面干涉，制止把她们的丈夫逐出澳大利亚。
