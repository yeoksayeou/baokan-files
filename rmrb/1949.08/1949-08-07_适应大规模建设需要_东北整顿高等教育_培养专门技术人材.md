Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 5th. To meet the needs of large-scale construction, the Northeast Administrative Committee has decided to rectify the existing higher education in the Northeast, so that it can break away from the nature of short-term training and move towards being lean and regularized. In the past three years, the work of higher education in the Northeast has achieved remarkable results. Many higher cadre schools have adopted the method of enrolling a large number of students for short-term training, and have trained tens of thousands of cadres, who have been assigned to work on the front lines and in the rear, which has played a great role in completing the land reform work in the Northeast and the war to liberate the entire Northeast. At present, there are 28 colleges and universities in the Northeast (excluding Inner Mongolia). There are 35,099 students. Many of these schools have not yet broken away from the form of training classes. Many students are not qualified, the quality of some teachers is poor, the school equipment is simple, a new type of regular higher education system has not been universally established, and there is even a phenomenon of each doing its own thing. This situation is no longer in line with the tasks of the current period of large-scale economic construction and cultural construction in the entire Northeast. Therefore, the Northeast Administrative Committee believes that it is necessary to rectify the existing higher education in the Northeast, unify standards, screen students, add professors, add funding, enrich equipment, add books and instruments, and establish a new and regular education system, so that all colleges and universities in the Northeast can be transformed into regular schools capable of undertaking the task of cultivating modern specialized technical talents. According to the above principles and tasks, the Northeast Administrative Committee has decided to establish 12 colleges and universities, including Shenyang Institute of Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenyang Agricultural College, Harbin Agricultural College, Shenyang Medical University, Harbin Medical University, Lu Xun Academy of Arts, Foreign Languages ​​College, and Northeast University, which specializes in training middle school teachers. In addition, all existing colleges and universities in the Northeast should be changed to secondary vocational schools or training classes. Regarding the academic system of colleges and universities, it is stipulated that colleges of engineering, agriculture, medicine, and natural sciences will graduate in four years, colleges of social sciences and arts will graduate in three to four years, and specialized courses will graduate in two years. First-year students of universities and colleges must have a high school graduation level, and existing students should be strictly screened. The Northeast Political Committee also decided to abolish the current system of all students in colleges and universities being on public expense. A scholarship system for college students will be implemented. In addition, the Northeast Political Committee has also made clear provisions on the standards for professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants in colleges and universities, appropriately strengthening political education, determining Russian as the first foreign language in colleges and universities, and the method of streamlining and reorganizing colleges and universities.

    适应大规模建设需要
    东北整顿高等教育
    培养专门技术人材
    【新华社沈阳五日电】东北行政委员会为适应大规模建设的需要，决定整顿东北现有高等教育，使其摆脱短期训练的性质，走向精干和正规化。过去三年来东北的高等教育的工作，已经获得显著成绩，许多高等干部学校，采取大量招生加以短期训练的方式，培养了几万干部，分配到前线和后方去工作，对完成东北土地改革工作及解放全东北的战争起了很大的作用。现在东北全境（不包括内蒙）共有专科以上学校二十八所。学生三万五千零九十九人。其中许多学校仍然没有摆脱训练班的形式，学生也有许多不够程度，部分教师质量也差，学校设备简陋，没有普遍建立新型正规化的高等教育学制，甚至还有各自为政的现象。这种情况已经和现在东北全境进入巨大规模的经济建设与文化建设时期的任务不相适应。因此，东北行政委员会认为，必须整顿现有东北高等教育，统一规定标准，甄别学生，增添教授，加添经费，充实设备，添置图书仪器及建立新型正规的教育制度，使东北高等学校全部转变为正规的能担负起培养现代专门技术人材任务的学校。根据以上方针和任务，东北行政委员会决定设立沈阳工学院、哈尔滨工业大学、沈阳农学院、哈尔滨农学院、沈阳医科大学、哈尔滨医科大学、鲁迅文艺学院、外国语专门学校及专门培养中学师资的东北大学等十二个专科以上学校，此外，东北现有各高等学校都应当改成中等职业学校或训练班。关于专科以上学校的学制，规定工、农、医及自然科学等学院四年毕业，社会科学及文艺学院三年到四年毕业，专修科二年毕业。大学本科及专科一年级学生必须具有高中毕业程度，现有学生应实行严格甄别。东北政委会又决定取消现有高等学校学生一律公费制度。实行高等学校学生助学金的制度。此外，东北政委会对于专科以上学校教授、讲师、助教的标准，适当地加强政治教育，确定俄文为高等学校第一外国语和高等学校进行精简整编办法等问题，也都作了明确的规定。
