(Beiping News) The first day of the Beiping Municipal People's Representatives Conference (August 9th) afternoon, Mayor Ye Jianying reported on "The Takeover and Administration Work of Beiping Municipality in the Past Six Months," including: First, the main experience of the takeover work; Second, municipal construction work; Third, production work; Fourth, education work; Fifth, suburban work. Finally, he pointed out three important tasks for the future. The following is a summary of the report.

First, the Main Experience of the Takeover Work
(1) Sufficient preparation work was carried out before entering the city: 1. Ideological education of cadres was conducted, so that cadres generally understood the tasks and situation of the takeover, made systematic reports to cadres, and held discussions to provide necessary ideological armament. 2. The organization of various departments of the Military Control Commission was established in advance, and the division of labor and relationships of each unit were stipulated.
(2) In the peaceful takeover method, the method of dispatching military control representatives and joint offices for handover was adopted, which reduced the state of anarchy during the transition between the old and the new and reduced destruction, which was beneficial to the people.
(3) Rely on the underground party and rely on the masses to carry out the takeover, while strengthening organization, discipline, and strictly requesting instructions and reporting systems to avoid making mistakes in policy.
(4) After the takeover work is basically completed, leadership and management should be strengthened immediately. The specific work is: 1. Properly handle the old personnel, retaining those who can be retained and assigning them to work with peace of mind, sending a part to certain educational institutions to study; a part of those with notorious bad deeds should be purged or punished; a part of those who want to go home should be given severance pay and sent back to their hometowns. 2. Transfer all public-owned enterprises and cultural and educational institutions that have been taken over to certain business agencies for responsible leadership and management; all materials are roughly divided into two categories, military and non-military, and uniformly distributed and used rationally. The cadres for takeover and management must be unified. Do not have one set of cadres for takeover and another set for management.
(5) When the Military Control Commission's takeover work is largely completed, it should immediately reduce its organization, conduct a disciplinary inspection of all cadres, carry out criticism and self-criticism, conduct in-depth reviews, overcome all disorganized and undisciplined thoughts and behaviors, and improve the ideological and policy level of each takeover cadre.

Second, Municipal Construction Work
From the day of the liberation of Beiping, we first paid attention to ensuring the supply of food, coal, water, transportation, and electricity to the city's two million people, and relied on the working class to inspire the enthusiasm of the workers. This is the mass foundation for us to run the city well. The following are the municipal aspects of the past six months:

(1) Establishing a people's democratic revolutionary social order. First of all, it is necessary to eliminate the lurking enemy—hidden secret agents, deal with scattered soldiers and bandits, and capture bandits. Our public security organs have handled more than 37,000 scattered military personnel and cracked more than 14,000 cases of various kinds in the past six months. With the progress of public security work, the proportion of solved cases has gradually increased, while the number of occurrences has gradually decreased. In addition, 1,744 thieves were arrested, 1,248 beggars were assisted in being taken in, and 1,522 silver dollar cases were cracked. The number of fires has also gradually decreased.
(2) Reforming district and street governments and public security bureau police stations. At the beginning of entering the city, due to the peaceful takeover method, bandits, secret agents, and scattered soldiers and bandits had planned to lurk in advance, and the vast majority of the working class was still not organized. The huge old police organization and personnel were still unable to be transformed, and the puppet Baojia system had not been destroyed. In order to maintain social order and connect with the masses, we took the approach of organizing a work team with a small number of veteran cadres and a large number of workers, students, and activists, and sending them to various Bao and streets to carry out work, responsible for investigating and understanding the situation, publicizing the policies and laws of the Party and the People's Government, reflecting the demands of the citizens, helping to exchange gold yuan coupons, distributing relief grain, eliminating scattered soldiers and bandits, clearing garbage, breaking the Baojia system, and establishing close ties with the masses. The work has been very successful. However, because we did not understand the characteristics of urban concentration, we mechanically transported the experience of rural government construction in the organizational form of urban government. After breaking the puppet Baojia system, we established a part of the street government as a typical experiment, and thus formed "multiple government authorities" and "disordered steps" in daily work. After Comrade Shaoqi's instruction, and in practice, it has been found that there are many problems, so all work is concentrated at the municipal level as much as possible, simplifying the district government organization, changing it to a district office, canceling the street government, transforming the public security police station, and specifically stipulating the business of the district office and the public security bureau police station itself and their relationship with each other. Some shortcomings were exposed in the work of transforming the public security police station, which were quickly overcome.
(3) Organizing peddlers and establishing traffic order. Peddlers in this city occupy both sides of the main roads in the city, hindering traffic and causing traffic accidents. At the same time, this is also very unfavorable to the peddlers' own business and must be organized. We believe that peddlers are also part of the people, and we should take care of, help, and manage them. This is different from the Kuomintang's reliance on a piece of paper and police force to forcibly ban them. Our current purpose of organizing peddlers is not to solve social and economic problems, but to manage the market, protect legitimate business, rectify street traffic order, prevent traffic accidents and fires, and ensure social security. Therefore, peddlers whose locations are sufficient to hinder traffic, cause fires, and affect public security will be "relocated to another place." Conversely, or to a degree that is not too serious, the "on-site organization" method will be generally used, and ideological explanations will be carried out in advance, meetings will be convened with peddlers to discuss and select a good place, and then it will be carried out step by step and with emphasis. At present, more than 40,000 peddlers have been able to get what they need, and traffic order has also made significant progress.
(4) Taking in beggars: Before liberation, it was difficult to count the number of beggars in Beiping. After liberation, some of them misunderstood "liberation" and became aggressive in begging. Our policy is: to take them in on the one hand, and to organize labor and educate and transform them on the other, so that they can maintain their lives by relying on their own labor. After being taken in, they are organized into classes, squads, and platoons, with them appointing their own leaders and deputy leaders, setting work and rest times, living rules, working and resting on time, and organizing them to study and engage in cultural entertainment. The transformation of these beggars will still take considerable time. We estimate that they will be able to be transformed.
(5) Cleaning and sanitation: In about three months, work such as epidemic prevention, environmental sanitation, medical relief, and school hygiene was carried out. In particular, in ninety-one days, more than 200,000 tons of garbage that had not been cleared for many years during the Kuomintang rule was cleared, and more than 200,000 jin of feces were cleared in the city. Secondly, with two-thirds of the previous epidemic prevention personnel, more epidemic prevention injections were completed than last year, and they were extended to the suburbs. Eleven epidemic prevention and sanitation stations were established in the suburbs. More than 31,000 people in the urban area were given free treatment, and more than 1,400 people in the urban area were treated. More than 26,000 people who went to the Health Bureau through district streets were given free treatment. Of course, there are still shortcomings in the health work, which must be thoroughly improved.
(6) The construction of roads and ditches. During the eleven years of rule by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries, roads were in disrepair, ditches were blocked, institutions were large and complex, personnel were redundant, and there was corruption and embezzlement. After our takeover, the puppet Public Works Bureau was abolished, the Construction Bureau was established, and a suburban work team was organized to screen and review the retention of old personnel and to enrich the suburban work team. In the past six months, 152,980 square meters of road surface have been repaired, 1,922 various wells have been built, and more than 4,600 meters of various ditches have been built. The river channels and flood control work have been rectified, and half of the roads planned to be repaired this year will be completed by the end of the month.
In addition, some of our municipal work still needs to be investigated and researched before reform, such as the more than 2,000 prostitutes in the city who still need to be dealt with, as well as other daily specific tasks.

Third, Production Work
We followed the economic policies of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao of "developing production, prospering the economy," "taking into account both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, helping each other between urban and rural areas, and exchanging internally and externally" of the New Democracy. At first, we concentrated our efforts on taking over, clearing up the puppet gold yuan coupons, and banning the use of silver dollars in order to stabilize the people's lives. Then, we proposed that the restoration, transformation, and development of production be our central task. Now, we will explain several issues in the restoration and development of production.

(1) Regarding public-owned production:
During the Kuomintang rule, some of the public-owned enterprises in this city were dilapidated and barely maintained, while most were in a state of suspension. Due to our continuous struggle with difficulties and the efforts of the workers, in less than half a year, the current public-owned industrial production has generally recovered, reaching and exceeding the level before liberation and the second half of last year. For example, the output of Yanjing Paper Mill increased by 263% compared with before liberation. Mentougou Coal Mine increased production by 13%. The output of the new brick factory doubled. There are many other examples.
The basic reasons why our public-owned factories and enterprises can overcome difficulties, restore and increase production are due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party, the clear policy of developing production, and the democratic reform of factory management, which has universally improved the workers' class consciousness and production enthusiasm and creativity.
In addition, the People's Government has provided great assistance to these public-owned enterprises, which have been restored on an extremely dilapidated foundation, by means of investment and loans.
From the perspective of the restoration and development of production, the production of our public-owned enterprises has made significant progress compared with the Kuomintang rule. However, the shortcomings are still very serious, mainly:
1. The democratic reform of factory management is still far from adequate. Some cadres do not have a clear enough ideological understanding of relying on the working class and how to give play to the workers' enthusiasm and creativity. Leaders of some enterprises cannot go deep into the masses and improve leadership in a timely manner. The bureaucratic institutions and systems have not been transformed in a timely manner or have not been thoroughly transformed.
2. Lacking experience in enterprise management, some factories still lack strict cost accounting and scientific management, and the phenomenon of factory organ-ization still exists to a considerable extent.
We must strive to overcome and correct these shortcomings.
(2) Regarding private-owned production:
In the past, private-owned industrial production was in a desperate situation under the rule of Kuomintang bureaucratic capital and the dumping of goods by US imperialism, with US goods flooding the market, malignant inflation, and heavy and complicated taxes. Beiping has a lot of floating capital, most of which is concentrated on commercial speculation, and the national industry is only lingering on its last breath, such as the Da Zhong Iron Factory. Around the 30th year of the Republic of China, including temporary workers, there were more than 100 workers. When Beiping was liberated, there were only five people left, and it had actually stopped working. Other private-owned industrial production could not be maintained either.

After the liberation of Beiping, due to our correct implementation of policies, protection of private-owned industries, and further support for their restoration and development, the production of private-owned industries has mostly recovered in the past six months, and some industries have exceeded the pre-liberation level and have been considerably developed. There are also new factories established after liberation, such as the soap-making industry. As of June, 148 new households were established, accounting for 48% of the total number of households. 123 new households were established in the handicraft weaving and dyeing industry, accounting for 26% of the total number of households.
In addition, the production of some industries has not only recovered, but has also reached the level of the 37th year of the Republic of China, and some have even exceeded the first half of last year.

The following points of experience should be pointed out in supporting private-owned industrial production:
1. Implement policies and eliminate concerns. Since liberation, we have held symposiums for workers and capitalists many times to explain the government's policy of protecting and supporting industries and businesses that are beneficial to the people's livelihood. In May, in handling industrial registration, we combined policy publicity with situation investigation, and actually solved some production problems, such as labor-capital disputes, the supply of raw materials, and the sales of finished products. At the beginning of May, Comrade Liu Shaoqi clearly explained the policy of four directions to private capitalists in Tianjin, which played a great role in dispelling the ideological concerns of private capitalists.
2. Banks and trade companies have helped private factories solve many production difficulties. More than 40 companies have received loans from banks, totaling more than 91 million yuan. In addition, in order to support special handicrafts, 305 households in 17 industries were loaned a total of 27 million yuan. 47 million yuan was loaned to exporters for packing loans. In addition, banks also tried out methods such as ordering and discounting loans under the principle of benefiting both public and private interests and supporting production to prevent speculation. This solved the difficulties of some manufacturers in raw materials and continued reproduction. For the support of handicrafts, the Cooperative Bank loaned a total of 35,992,008 yuan to 986 households by the end of July. These loans partially solved the problems of the resumption of work in some small factories and workshops, and the unemployment of some workers.

The trade company used methods such as exchanging raw materials for finished products (for the weaving and dyeing industry and the knitting industry), purchasing finished products (for the soap industry), entrusting processing (for the flour industry and the dyeing industry), and selling finished products on commission, which solved the problems of raw material supply and finished product sales for many industries. In addition, the spirit of developing production was also implemented in taxation. The tax rate for industry was lower than that for commerce. When collecting the spring business tax, it was stipulated that small-scale handicrafts and special handicraft manufacturing industries were exempt from business tax, and the tax rate for the industrial machinery industry was reduced to 1%.
Due to these effective measures to actively support industry, private capitalists have further understood the industrial and commercial policies, thereby inspiring their enthusiasm for production and encouraging many people who did not engage in production before to turn to production.

In addition, in the work of restoring and developing production, we focused on the link of communicating urban and rural trade and established the Urban and Rural Trade Steering Committee. We actively developed trade relations in many regions. In June, the Industrial and Commercial Bureau assisted the Industrial Association in holding an industrial exhibition, inviting delegations from various parts of North China and other liberated areas to visit Beiping, exchanging production information in various regions, understanding the needs of various regions for industrial products in this city, and concluding goods worth a total of 160 million yuan with various regions, and began to establish relations with various regions for exchanging materials. The Municipal Trade Company and the Trade Steering Committee jointly organized investigation groups for Northeast and Northwest China to study the needs of various regions.
In short, in the past six months, Beiping's industrial production has made progress and achievements, but it must be admitted that there are still serious difficulties and shortcomings. For example, some manufacturers do not have enough production funds and should try to absorb private floating capital into industrial production, and banks must also prepare to further support it in a planned manner. As for the difficulties in the supply of raw materials and materials, this is a difficulty that will inevitably be encountered in the process of the transition from semi-colonial production to independent and autonomous production, and this difficulty can and must be overcome.

Secondly, it must be emphasized that we must improve quality, reduce costs, and meet the specifications and standards of commodities. Our industrial products must be "good and cheap" and suitable for rural needs in order to win sales.
Due to our lack of experience and knowledge, we have not done enough in guiding and planning the overall production, which is reflected in the fact that the direction guidance for the industrial production of this city is not specific and timely, so we have not corrected the blindness in production in a timely manner. There was a period when knitting and soap making sometimes showed that supply was sometimes less than demand and sometimes overproduction. The coordination between public-owned industry and private-owned industry, banks and trade companies, machinery factories and handicraft workshops has not been done enough, and we have failed to establish a reasonable and appropriate connection between each other.

Fourth, Education Work Here, we will only talk about primary and secondary school education.
There are currently 108 secondary schools under the management of the city, of which 82 are private. There are 790 primary schools and kindergartens, of which 198 are private. Number of people: 42,944 in middle schools, 3,181 teachers and staff, 158,756 primary school students, 4,673 teachers and staff. After liberation, we immediately determined that we must follow the New Democratic education policy, that is, to establish national, scientific, and mass education content, and cultivate construction talents with the idea of serving the people and specialized knowledge and skills, as the goal of transforming and developing Beiping's education. However, in order to implement this policy step by step and in a planned way, we have adopted a policy of temporarily maintaining the status quo, starting school on time, and carrying out takeover and reform step by step for various primary and secondary schools. In the past six months, the following preliminary reform work has been carried out:

1. Administrative reform: First of all, it is the leadership composition of the school. Now all public schools have been taken over, and a small number of teachers and staff who insisted on being anti-people, ideologically reactionary, or incompetent have been replaced. The organization has been streamlined. The previous four departments have been changed to two departments, general affairs and teaching. Economic matters are made public, economical, and basically eliminate corruption. A small number of schools have also used the income to add equipment. Secondly, it is to enlighten and promote students' democratic and conscious learning spirit, and gradually establish a democratic management system, eliminate the feudal and fascist barbaric control of students in the Kuomintang era, and overcome the scattered bias that occurred among students in the early days of liberation. For a small number of private middle schools controlled by special agents, we took over or managed them on behalf of the government, liberating students from the control of reactionary special agents and providing them with a new environment where they can study with peace of mind.
2. Curriculum reform: Reactionary courses such as Party Doctrine and Civics have been abolished, and new textbooks have generally been adopted for Chinese language and history. Three-quarters of middle schools in the city have added fixed political classes, and practical education has been carried out for various ideas among students.
3. Uniting and transforming old teachers is also an important part of educational reform. We assisted the preparatory committee of the Education Federation in holding various lectures and seminars, and established research organizations for politics, Chinese language, and history, creating a warm learning atmosphere among teachers. We held summer study meetings for primary and secondary school teachers and staff, and have achieved considerable success.
4. Relieving poor students: Temporary relief funds were issued to poor students and students whose families were in the to-be-liberated areas and whose economic sources were cut off. At the beginning of liberation, the relief funds were distributed relatively chaotically, and relief funds were also given to those who should not be given relief funds. Due to the progress of students' thinking, after sorting out and voluntarily returning the relief funds, the actual number of recipients was 3,472. In the next semester, a formal people's student grant will be established to achieve greater fairness and rationality, and to ensure that outstanding students from poor families have the opportunity to study.
However, the entire education reform still requires all teachers who are willing to serve the people to unite and work harder.

Fifth, Suburban Work
There was no special working organization for suburban work at first. After May, the Suburban Work Committee was established, and the work further moved towards standardization. Since the liberation of the suburbs in December last year, the following four items have been the main tasks:

1. Supporting the front: At the beginning of the Pingjin Campaign, the suburbs first cooperated with the people in the old areas to complete the huge task of supporting the front during the siege. First of all, we organized command headquarters for supporting the front at all levels, supply stations and grain stations in various places, and some villages organized committees for supporting the front. After these organizations mobilized the masses, they ensured the supply of the troops and cooperated with the troops to liberate Beiping.
When carrying out the work, we first exposed the various rumors created by the enemy, publicized the various policies of the People's Government, stabilized people's hearts, and united the masses. In terms of food supply, in addition to the continuous supply of food from the old liberated areas to the front line, in order to ensure that the troops had food in time, we adopted the methods of "taking from the local area" and "reasonable borrowing of grain." For the supply of non-staple food, we adopted the method of consultation with the masses and wholesale purchase. On the one hand, we ensured the supply of the troops, and on the other hand, we decided that the government would compensate the masses for the losses caused by the high prices of vegetables. In other aspects of manpower and material mobilization, we basically took into account the needs of the troops and the lives of the masses. Therefore, the vast masses had a high enthusiasm for supporting the front and completed the heavy task of supporting the front. This is a great achievement of the suburban cadres and masses.
2. In terms of agricultural production: 1. At the beginning of liberation, the land problem was not solved, and most farmers took a wait-and-see attitude towards production. Later, after we announced the policy of whoever cultivates it will harvest it, we stabilized the production mood of most farmers. 2. Loans of 20 million yuan in People's Currency (mostly used to purchase agricultural tools, seeds, livestock, and fertilizers) and more than 20,000 jin of millet (half used for water conservancy and half used for reclamation). 3. The large canal in the northern Xin'an villages of the 19th District was renovated, which can irrigate 13,000 mu of farmland (5,400 mu more than last year). During the call for drought resistance and famine preparation by the North China Government this spring, only 5 districts incompletely counted a total of 421 wells dug and repaired. The construction work of the Yongding River embankment before the rainy season has been successfully completed. Mobilizing farmers to open drainage ditches in waterlogged farmland has achieved good results, and most of the insect disasters that occurred this summer have been eliminated. In mid-June, there was a serious hailstorm in Fengtai and Nanyuan districts, and grain and seeds have been loaned out to mobilize farmers to replenish fields and replant. 4. A large number of small pieces of wasteland were reclaimed in various districts. 5. Mobilized the masses to plant trees during the Qingming Festival. For example, in Changxindian, under the call of "one tree per person," a total of 37,000 trees were planted, and more than two-thirds of them are now alive.
3. In terms of democratic government construction: After mid-March, various districts carried out the destruction of the puppet Baojia system and the establishment of the people's village government. The suburban district division was also adjusted, from 15 districts to 9 districts. Now the district agencies have been improved, and the work efficiency has been improved. After liberation, many civil cases were requested for mediation, and the common people also brought up old cases that had been filed for many years to request mediation. The suburbs have held social relief, with each district distributing 10,000 jin of relief grain. In addition, there are a total of 4,019 households of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers' families in the suburbs, and tens of thousands of jin of pension grain and preferential grain have been distributed.
4. In terms of land reform: After liberation, farmers demanded land one after another, but at that time, because the level of awareness of the general masses was not high enough, the peasant associations had not been universally organized, and at the same time, spring plowing was imminent, and production was taken into account. In this way, the government, on the one hand, stabilized the production mood, and on the other hand, had to solve the farmers' land demands that could be solved. In principle, the principle of "whoever cultivates it will harvest it" was put forward to stabilize the production mood of all classes, and the public land or the land that the landlord could not manage and the land of the fugitive landlord was appropriately transferred to the landless and land-poor farmers for cultivation. At the same time, the upper rent was abolished, forcing the landlords to return the rent to the farmers, which solved the production materials and living difficulties of some farmers. Ensure that spring plowing and sowing are completed smoothly.

At present, preparations for various land reforms are being carried out in accordance with the Military Control Commission's "Decision on Agricultural Land Issues in the Municipal Area."
In the past six months, peasant associations have been established in production and government construction. They are further consolidating themselves ideologically, stylistically, and organizationally, training cadres, and educating members. So far, peasant associations have been established in 472 villages, and peasant preparatory committees have been established in 109 villages, with 48,728 members. At the same time, the preparatory committees of peasant associations in various districts and the preparatory committee of the municipal peasant association have been formally established.

Secondly, typical experiments are being carried out to concretely implement our land policy in several rural areas and to gain experience from them for the planned and step-by-step development of the land reform movement in various districts in the future. It is estimated that the experimental work may be completed recently, and the "land reform" work can be carried out more generally in various districts soon.
This is the work situation in the past six months. The report has been completed. There are still more arduous tasks before us. There are still many shortcomings and difficulties in our work. At present, we must concentrate all our efforts and first carry out the following
Three important tasks:

First, further consolidate the revolutionary order of the people of Beiping, continue to resolutely suppress the activities of all counter-revolutionary elements, continue to eliminate the remaining forces and special agents of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.
Second, take all effective methods to continue to restore and develop Beiping's production. In the field of public-owned production, we should strive to reduce costs, improve quality, and increase production according to the situation of raw materials and markets, and rely on the working masses to realize the democratization of enterprise management. In the field of private-owned production, we should continue to systematically solve the labor-capital relations in various industries, sign labor-capital contracts, support private-owned industrial and commercial enterprises with development prospects, unify production specifications, ensure a certain quality and quantity of production, and strengthen the direction guidance for private-owned production, and try to overcome the blindness of production.
Third, continue to develop the people's cultural and educational undertakings, further transform primary and secondary school education, strengthen mass social education, especially worker education, and enable workers' children to have access to education. Strengthen the political and theoretical study of cadres in service, and educate and transform the old staff members in various departments who are willing to serve the people, so that they can better serve the people and serve the construction of New Democracy.

　　北平市半年来接管与施政工作
    叶剑英市长在北平市各界代表会议上的报告摘要
    【平市讯】北平市各界代表会议第一日（八月九日）下午，叶剑英市长报告“关于北平市半年来接管与施政工作”，内容包括：第一、接管工作的主要经验；第二、市政建设工作；第三、生产工作；第四、教育工作；第五、郊区工作。最后并指出今后的三项重要工作，兹摘要发表如下。
    第一、接管工作的主要经验
    （一）入城之前进行了充分的准备工作：１、进行了干部思想教育，使干部普遍了解接管的任务与情况，向干部做系统的报告，并举行讨论，从政策思想上给以必要的武装。２、预先建立了军管会各部门的组织，并规定各单位的分工与关系。
    （二）在和平接管的方式上，采用了派军管代表及联合办事处接交的办法，减少了新旧交替中的无政府状态，减少了破坏，这对于人民是有利的。
    （三）依靠地下党依靠群众进行接管，同时加强组织性、纪律性、严格请示报告制度，避免在政策上犯错误。
    （四）接收工作基本上告一段落后，应即加强领导和管理，其具体工作是：１、适当的处理旧人员，可以留用的则分别留用，使之安心工作，一部分送一定的教育机关去学习；一部分劣迹昭著的应加以清洗或惩办；一部分要回家的，资遣还乡。２、将已接收的一切公营事业及文化教育机关，分别移交给一定的业务机关负责领导与管理；所有物资，按军用与非军用的大体分为两类，统一分配，合理使用。接收与管理的干部必须统一，不要接收的是一套干部，而管理的又是另外一套干部。
    （五）军管会在接管工作大体告一段落时，应即缩小机构，并对全体干部进行一次纪律检查，开展批评与自我批评，深入检讨，克服一切无组织、无纪律的思想与行为，把每个接管干部的思想与政策水平提高一步。
    第二、市政建设工作
    从北平解放之日起，首先注意保证供给全市二百万人民的粮食、煤炭、用水、交通和电力，并依靠工人阶级，启发工人的积极性，这是我们办好市政的群众基础。半年来市政方面的几项工作是：
    （一）建立人民民主革命的社会秩序。首先必须肃清潜伏的敌人—暗藏的特务，处理散兵游勇，捕捉盗匪。我公安机关半年来处理流散军人三万七千余名，破获各种案件一万四千多件。随着治安工作的进步，破案比例逐渐上升，而发生次数则逐渐减少。此外，还抓捕小偷一千七百四十四人，协助收容乞丐一千二百四十八人，破获银元案一千五百二十二件。火警亦逐渐减少。
    （二）改革区街政权及公安局派出所。在入城之初，由于和平接管的方式，匪特、与散兵游勇，已事先有计划的潜伏，而工人阶级绝大部分尚无组织，庞大的旧警察机构和人员尚来不及改造，伪保甲制度亦未摧毁，为了维护社会秩序，联系群众，乃采取以少数老干部和大批工人、学生、积极分子，组织工作组，派到各保、各街进行工作，负责调查和了解情况，宣传党和人民政府的政策法令，反映市民要求，帮助兑换金元券，发救济粮，肃清散兵游勇，清除垃圾，粉碎保甲制度，与群众建立密切联系，工作是有很大成绩的。但由于我们不了解城市集中的特点，在城市政权的组织形式上机械地搬运了乡村建政的经验，在粉碎了伪保甲制度后当作典型的试验，建立了一部分街政权，于是在日常工作中形成“政出多门”“步调紊乱”，后经少奇同志指示，并且在实践中已发现了毛病很多，遂将一切工作尽量集中于市一级来进行，简化区政权机构，改为区公所，取消街政权，改造公安派出所，并具体规定了区公所与公安局派出所的本身业务及其相互之关系，进行改造公安派出所工作中，暴露了一些缺点，旋即克服。
    （三）整理摊贩，建立交通秩序。本市摊贩占据市内各要道两侧，妨害交通，引起车祸，同时这对摊贩本身的营业亦十分不利，必须加以整理。我们认为摊贩也是人民大众的一部分，对他们应该采取照顾帮助与管理的办法，不同于国民党的只凭一纸命令，凭警察武力，横加取缔，我们现在整理摊贩的目的还不是当作社会经济问题来解决的，是为了管理市场，保护正当营业，整顿街道交通秩序，防止车祸、火警，保障社会治安。因此，凡摊贩摆设的位置足以妨碍交通，造成火警，影响治安者，则“择地迁移”之，反之，或者在程度上不太严重的，就通用“就地整理”办法，并且事先进行了思想解释，召集摊贩开会讨论选好地方，然后有步骤，有重点的进行，目前四万多户摊贩，均能各得其所，交通秩序也有了显著的进步。
    （四）收容乞丐：解放前，北平乞丐数目很难统计，解放后他们之中有一部分人误解“解放”强乞恶讨，我们的处理方针是：一面收容，一面组织劳动，加以教育改造，使之依靠自己劳动维持生活。收容之后，编成班、分队、中队，由他们自任正副班长订出作息时间，生活规则，按时作息，组织他们学习和文化娱乐。这些乞丐的改造，还需要相当时间，我们估计他们是能够得到改造的。
    （五）清洁卫生：约三个月内共进行了防疫、环境卫生、医药救济、学校卫生等工作，特别是在九十一天中清除了国民党统治时期多年来未清除的二十多万吨垃圾，又清除了市内粪便二十多万斤。其次，以过去三分之二的防疫人员完成了比去年更多的防疫注射，并扩展到城郊，在郊区设立了防疫卫生站十一个。给城区市民免费治疗者达三万一千多人，给城区市民治病也有一千四百多人，经区街到卫生局免费治疗者有二万六千余人，卫生工作当然还有缺点，尚须彻底改进。
    （六）道路沟渠的修建，日寇与国民党反动派，十一年的统治期间，道路失修，沟渠淤塞，机构庞杂，人事浮冗，贪污私饱。自我接管后，取消伪工务局，成立建设局，并组织郊区工作队，对旧人员加以甄别审查去留，充实郊区工作队，半年来修路面一十五万二千九百八十平方公尺，各种井一千九百二十二座，各种沟四千六百多公尺，并整顿了河道与防汛工作，月底可以完成全市本年拟修补之路的半数。
    此外，我们在市政工作上有的尚待调查研究，然后进行改革，如全市共约二千多妓女尚待处理，还有其他日常具体工作。
    第三、生产工作
    我们遵照着中共中央和毛主席“发展生产、繁荣经济”，“公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流”的新民主主义的经济政策。最初是集中力量进行接管，肃清伪金元券，禁用银元，借以安定人民生活。接着即提出以恢复、改造、发展生产为我们的中心任务，现就恢复与发展生产中的几个问题加以说明。
    （一）关于公营生产方面：
    本市公营企业各单位，在国民党统治时期，有的破烂不堪勉强维持，而大部分处于停工状态。由于我们不断与困难作斗争，以及职工们的努力，不到半年的时间，现在公营工业生产已经一般的恢复起来，达到和超过解放前和去年下半年的水准。例如燕京造纸厂产量比解放前提高到百分之二六三。门头沟煤矿提高产量百分之十三。新建砖厂产量增加一倍。其他例子尚多。
    我们公营工厂企业之所以能克服困难，恢复和增加生产，其基本原因是由于共产党的正确领导，发展生产的明确方针，及工厂管理的民主改革，使工人的阶级觉悟和生产的积极性与创造性都普遍提高了。
    另外，人民政府对于这些在极其破烂不堪的基础上恢复起来的公营企业用投资和贷款的方式，加以很大的帮助。
    从生产的恢复和发展的情形来看，我们公营企业的生产比之于国民党统治时期是有着显著进步的。但是，缺点还是很严重的，主要是：
    １工厂管理的民主改革还做得很不够，一些干部对于依靠工人阶级和如何发挥工人的积极性、创造性，有思想上认识得还不够明确，若干企业领导者尚不能深入群众，及时改进领导：对官僚化的机构与制度没有及时改造或改造得不彻底。
    ２缺乏企业化经营的经验，有些工厂还缺乏严格的成本计算和科学的管理，工厂机关化的现象还相当严重地存在着。
    这些缺点我们必须努力克服和纠正。
    （二）关于私营生产方面：
    私营工业生产，过去因为在国民党官僚资本的统治和美帝国主义的商品倾销下，美货充斥，恶性通货膨胀，加以苛杂繁重，因此，使工业生产陷入了绝境。北平有很多游资，大部分集中于商业上的投机，民族工业只是奄奄一息，如大中铁工厂。民国三十年前后，连临时工在内，曾达一○○多个工人，北平解放时只有五个人了，实际上已经停工。其他私营工业生产也都不能维持。
    北平解放后，由于我们正确的执行了政策，保护了私营工业，并进一步扶助他们促其恢复和发展，半年以来，私人工业的生产大部恢复并且有一些行业已超过了解放前，得到相当发展。也有解放后增设的新厂，如造胰业，截止到六月份新设了一四八户，占总户数的百分之四十八。手工织染业新设一二三户占总户数的百分之二十六。
    此外有些工业的生产不仅是恢复了，并且已经达到三十七年度的水准，个别的还超过了去年前半年。
    在扶植私营工业生产中应指出如下几点经验：
    １、贯彻政策，消除顾虑。解放以来，我们历次召开工人和资本家的座谈会，阐释政府保护和扶植有益于国民生计的工商业政策，五月份在办理工业登记中，结合了宣传政策与调查情况，并实际的解决了一些生产中的问题，如劳资纠纷，原料的供给，和成品的推销等等。五月初刘少奇同志在天津向私人资本家明确的解释了四面八方的政策，在解除私人资本家的思想顾虑上起了很大作用。
    ２、通过银行和贸易公司帮助私营工厂解决了许多生产上的困难。由银行贷予款项的有四十余家，共九千一百余万元。另外，为了扶植特种手工业贷给十七个行业共三○五户，二千七百万元。贷给出口商的打包放款四千七百万元，此外银行又在公私两利与扶植生产防止投机的原则下试办了定货、折实等贷款办法。解决了一些厂家在原料与继续再生产中的困难。对于手工业的扶植，合作银行到七月底共贷予九八六户，贷出三五、九九二、○○八元，这些贷款部分的解决了一些小的工厂作坊复业，和一些工人的失业问题。
    贸易公司则用了以原料换成品（对织染业针织业）收购成品（对肥皂业），委托加工（对面粉业染布业）及代销成品等方式，解决了许多行业的原料供应成品推销的问题。此外在税收上也贯彻了发展生产的精神，在税率上工业轻于商业，在征收春季营业税时规定小型手工业，特种手工艺制造业等免纳营业税，工业机器业税率减低为百分之一。
    由于以上这些积极扶植工业的有效措施，就使得私人资本家们更进一步的了解了工商业政策，从而启发了他们的生产积极性，也鼓励了许多以前不从事生产的人们转向生产。
    另外在恢复与发展生产的工作中，我们抓准了沟通城乡贸易这一环节，成立了城乡贸易指导委员会。积极发展了许多地区的贸易关系。六月份由工商局协助工业会举办了工业展览会，邀请华北各地和其他解放区派代表团来平参观，交换了各个地区的生产情况，了解了各个地区对本市工业产品需要的情形，并与各地成交总值一六、○○○万元的货物，开始建立了与各地交换物资的关系。并由市贸易公司、贸易指导委员会共同组织了东北、西北调查小组研究了各地需要情况。
    总之，半年来，北平的工业生产是有进步有成绩的，但必须承认还存在着严重的困难与缺点。如有些厂家生产资金不足，应尽量吸收私人游资转入工业生产，银行也必须准备更进一步有计划的来扶植。至于原料与材料的供应上的困难，这是从过去半殖民地的生产向着独立自主的生产的转变过程中必然会遭遇到的困难，这种困难是能够和必须克服的。
    其次，必须强调提高质量，减低成本，合乎商品的规格与标准，必须使我们的工业产品“物美价廉”适合农村需要，才能争取打开销路。
    由于我们经验和知识的缺乏，对整个生产的指导和计划上做得还很不够，表现在对本市工业生产的方向指导上不具体，不及时，因而没有适时的纠正生产上的盲目性，曾经有一个时期针织、造胰表现了有时供不应求又有时生产过剩。在公营工业与私营工业，银行与贸易公司，机器工厂和手工作坊等的配合上，也都做的不够，未能使彼此之间建立起合理而适当的联系。
    第四、教育工作这里只讲中小学教育。
    中等学校现属市管的一○八处、其中私立的占八二处，小学及幼稚园共七九○处，私立的占一九八处。人数：中学占四二、九四四人，教职员三、一八一人，小学生，一五八、七五六人，教职员四、六七三人。解放后我们即确定必须按照新民主主义教育方针，即为建立民族的、科学的、大众的教育内容，培养具有为人民服务思想和专门知识技能的建国人材，做为改造和发展北平市教育的目标。但为了有步骤、有计划地贯彻这一方针，我们对各中小学采取了暂时维持原状，按时开学，有步骤的进行接管与改革的方针。半年来进行了下列几项初步的改革工作：
    一、行政改革：首先是学校领导成份。现在全部公立学校均已接管，撤换了坚持反人民的、思想反动的、或不称职的少数教职员，机构精简了，从过去的四大处改为总务教导二处，经济上做到公开、节约，和基本上消灭了贪污，少数学校并以此所得添置了设备。其次是启发与发扬学生民主自觉的学习精神，并逐渐建立了民主管理制度，扫除了国民党时代对学生的封建的法西斯的野蛮控制，也克服了解放初期学生中发生的散漫的偏向。对少数如特务把持之私立中学则加以接管或代管，把学生从反动特务的控制下解放出来，得到安心读书的新环境。
    二、课程改革：反动课程如党义、公民等均已废止，国文、历史一般亦采用了新教材。全市中学四分之三增设了固定的政治课，针对着学生中各种思想进行了实际的教育。
    三、团结并改造旧教师，也是教育改革的重要工作之一。我们协助教联筹委会举办了各种讲座、座谈，成立了政治，国文，历史的研究组织，造成了教师间热烈的学习空气，举办了中小学教职员的暑期学习会，已取得相当的成就。
    四、救济贫苦学生：对贫苦及家在待解放区而经济来源断绝的学生，发给临时救济金，在解放之初，救济金曾经发的比较混乱，不该救济不必救济的也给予了救济金，由于学生思想的进步，经整理自愿退领救济金后，实领者三千四百七十二人。下学期将确立正式的人民助学金，以求得更公平合理，并务使必须救济的清寒优秀学生获得求学的机会。
    但整个教育的改革，尚须全体愿意为人民服务的教师团结起来进行更艰苦的努力。
    第五、郊区工作
    郊区工作最初没有专门工作机构，五月份以后，建立了郊区工作委员会，工作进一步走上正规。自去年十二月郊区解放以来，就其主要工作来说，有下列四项：
    一、支前：平津战役开始，当时郊区首先配合老区人民完成围城期间浩大的支前工作。首先我们组织了各级支前指挥部，各地供应站粮站，有的村则组织了支前委员会，经过了这些组织发动群众保证部队供给，和配合部队解放北平。
    进行工作时，首先揭穿了敌人制造的各种谣言，宣传人民政府各种政策，稳定了人心，团结了群众。在粮食供给上，除老解放区食粮源源不断供给前线外，为了及时保证部队吃饭，我们采取“就地取给”和“合理借粮”的办法。对副食品的供给上采取和群众协商，整批购买，一面保证部队供应，另方面则决定因物价高涨吃菜赔价由政府补偿群众损失。其他人力物力的动员上，也基本上照顾了部队需要和群众生活两方面情况。因此广大群众支前情绪高涨，完成了繁重的支前任务，这是郊区干部群众很大的一个工作成绩。
    二、在农业生产方面：１解放之初，土地问题没有解决，一般农民对生产抱观望态度，后来我们宣布了谁种谁收政策后，安定了一般农民的生产情绪。２贷款计人民券两千万元（大部用于购买农具种子牲畜肥料等）小米两万多斤（一半用于水利一半用于开荒）。３整修十九区北辛安诸村大水渠可灌溉农田一三、○○○亩（比去年多灌溉五、四○○亩），在今春华北政府号召抗旱备荒期间，只五个区不完全统计共打井修井四二一眼，雨季前永定河河堤的修筑工作，即已顺利完成。在被涝农地动员农民开排水沟，都有良好成绩，今夏发生的虫灾大部亦已消灭。六月中旬在丰台、南苑两区有严重的雹灾，已进行贷粮贷种工作，发动农民补田补种。４各区大量开垦小块荒地。５清明节发动群众植树，如长辛店在“一人一株树”的号召下，即共植三七、○○○株，现已活成在三分之二以上。
    三、在民主建政方面：三月中旬以后，各区均进行摧毁伪保甲制度，建立人民的村政权。郊区区划，亦加以调整，由十五个区调整九个区，现在区的机构已经健全，工作效率提高了。解放后请求调解的民事案件很多，老百姓把多年陈案也拿来请求调解。郊区曾举行过社会救济，每区发救济粮一万斤，另郊区的烈军工属共有四、○一九户，已发抚恤粮和优待粮数十万斤。
    四、在土地改革方面　解放后农民纷纷要求土地，但当时由于一般群众觉悟程度不够，农会尚未普遍组织起来，同时春耕在即，照顾生产，如此，政府一面为了安定生产情绪，一面又必须解决与可能解决的农民土地要求。原则上提出“谁种谁收”安定了各阶层生产情绪，并适当的将公地或地主无力经营与逃亡地主之土地调剂给无地少地之农民耕种，同时并废除了上打租，迫使地主退租给农民，解决了一部分农民的生产资料及生活困难。保证春耕播种顺利完成。
    目前正在根据军管会“关于本市辖区农业土地问题的决定”进行各项土地改革的准备工作。
    半年来在生产建政中农会组织已经建立起来了，他们正从思想上、作风上、组织上进一步整顿自己，培养干部，教育会员至今已在四七二个村建立了农会，一○九个村建立了农筹会，会员四八、七二八人。同时各区农会筹备会及市农筹会，均已正式建立。
    其次进行典型试验，将我们的土地政策，在几个农村中具体实施，并从中取得经验，以供今后各区有计划有步骤的展开土改运动，估计实验工作可能在最近结束，不久各区即可较普遍地进行“土地改革”工作。
    半年来的工作情况就是如此。已经报告完了。摆在我们面前的还有更艰巨的任务，我们工作中还存在着很多缺点和困难，目前我们必须集中一切力量，首先进行下列
    三项重要工作：
    第一、进一步巩固北平人民的革命秩序，继续坚决镇压一切反革命分子的活动，继续肃清国民党反动派的残余势力和特务匪徒，巩固人民民主专政。
    第二、采取一切有效的方法，继续恢复与发展北平的生产。在公营生产方面，应该努力减低成本、提高质量，并根据原料与市场的情况，增加生产，依靠工人群众实现企业管理的民主化。在私营生产方面，应该继续系统地解决各行业的劳资关系，订立劳资合同，扶植有发展前途的私营工商业，统一生产的规格，保证生产品的一定质量与产量，加强对私营生产的方向指导，尽量克服生产的盲目性。
    第三、继续发展人民的文化教育事业，进一步改造中小学教育，加强群众的社会教育，特别是职工教育，并使职工子弟得到受教育的机会。加强在职干部的政治理论学习，对于各部门愿意为人民服务的旧的工作人员加以教育改造，使他们更好的为人民服务，为新民主主义的建设而服务。
