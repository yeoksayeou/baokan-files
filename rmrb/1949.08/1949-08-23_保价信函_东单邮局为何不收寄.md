"Insured Letter"
Why the Dongdan Post Office Doesn't Accept Them

To the Editor:

　　I recently received an "insured letter" sent from Shanghai. However, when I went to the Dongdan Post Office to inquire about sending an "insured letter" to Xi'an, they refused to accept it. Is the Dongdan Post Office not responsible? Why is it that Shanghai can accept them, but Beijing cannot, even though they are both post offices?

　　Cao Jianchi

Mr. Cao Jianchi:

　　Our bureau has not yet been ordered to resume handling "insured letter" services. Therefore, it is not wrong for the Dongdan Post Office to refuse to accept "insured letters." The Shanghai Post Office is under the jurisdiction of the East China Postal Administration, while the Beijing Post Office is under the jurisdiction of the North China Postal Administration. The services provided in the two regions may not be entirely the same.

### “保价信函”  东单邮局为何不收寄

　　“保价信函”
    东单邮局为何不收寄编辑先生：
    日前本人曾收到由上海寄来“保价信函”一件。但我到东单邮局去接洽交寄到西安去的“保价信函”，他们却不收寄。是不是东单邮局不负责？同是邮局何以上海能收北平却不收？  　曹建池曹建池先生：
    本局尚未奉令恢复办理“保价信函”业务，故东单邮局不收寄“保价信函”并无错误。至上海邮局系隶属华东邮政总局管辖，北平邮局则隶属华北邮政总局管辖，两地业务容有未尽相同。
