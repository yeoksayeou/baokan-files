The Bank of Communications' Deposit Business

After the takeover of the Bank of Communications in the Ping and Tianjin areas, its internal organizational structure was slightly reorganized and reformed according to work needs. It opened simultaneously on March 15th, under the leadership of the local People's Bank of China, specializing in deposit and loan business for industrial, mining, transportation, postal, and telecommunications enterprises.

In terms of deposit business, a variety of methods were adopted to develop it. For example, the Bank of Communications in Beiping took the initiative to contact military representatives of public enterprises to open accounts, visited old customers of the Bank of Communications, explained to them, dispelled their doubts, and rebuilt business relationships; clarified the government's policy of supporting private enterprises that are beneficial to the development of the national economy to private factories to attract their deposits; and provided various conveniences to customers by sending staff to collect and deliver funds at designated locations of depositors and simplifying internal procedures. In terms of loan business, loans were provided to public and private enterprises in the form of ordering, price-linked loans, collateral, and fixed-term loans. The use of loans was mostly limited to the purchase of raw materials. The focus of loans was mainly on industries such as textiles, flour, paper making, and chemicals. For example, from the beginning of April to May 12th, the textile industry accounted for 33.29% of the total amount of loans granted by the Tianjin Bank of Communications, the chemical industry accounted for 23.1%, the flour industry accounted for 14.6%, the paper making industry accounted for 13.2%, the match industry accounted for 8.46%, the iron industry accounted for 3.96%, and the oil industry accounted for 1.67%.

In terms of lending methods, according to statistics from the Tianjin Bank of Communications from April 1st to May 12th, ordering accounted for 81% of all loans, and price-linked loans accounted for 31.57%. From this percentage, it can be seen that the loans in this period were mainly in the form of ordering and price-linking. Because with these two methods, both the borrower and the lender would not suffer losses whether the price rose or fell, which facilitated the progress of production. The details are as follows:

1.  Ordering Loans: This is one of the loan methods based on "mutual benefit for both public and private sectors." When a factory takes out a loan, in addition to collecting a certain amount of interest in kind, the bank orders futures of a certain quality and quantity from it. The types of goods ordered are limited to popular goods with clear brands, wide sales, and close ties to military and civilian use. The calculation of the ordering price also varies depending on the production process, season, and market of each factory. For example, after the Tianjin Yaohua Glass Company started operations in early April, glass sales were sluggish and capital turnover was difficult. However, it planned to purchase and store raw materials to ensure the continuation of production. Therefore, on April 7th, it negotiated with the Tianjin Bank of Communications for an ordering loan. The price of each box of glass (its standard box for sale is based on the price of three bags of general flour) was calculated according to the price on that day, and the monthly interest rate of the loan was six percent. On May 6th, when it was due, the bank sold the ordered goods to the trust company at Yaohua's listed price on that day. If the principal and interest recovered were calculated according to the price of general flour on that day, the bank would still lose 9.8% in kind, but it was generally close to breaking even. As for Yaohua Company, it bought the raw materials it needed on the day it obtained the loan, and the difficulties of not being able to sell inventory temporarily and the lack of funds were resolved. The monthly output increased from 20,000 boxes before liberation to 54,000 boxes, achieving the goals of increasing production and reducing costs.

This type of ordering loan has the following advantages: A. It can fully exert the effectiveness of loans in developing production, ensure that loans are used for production, and drive private capital to actively participate. At the same time, this is completely different from the phenomenon of credit loans where factories require more loans as prices rise. The burden of debt in kind also has a controlling effect on speculators. B. It truly achieves "mutual benefit for both public and private sectors." After the bank grasps the calculation of physical objects, it can maintain and continuously increase the strength of supporting production for a long time, and reduce currency issuance. This not only helps stabilize prices, but also effectively solves the difficulties of those who truly lack production funds, and enables borrowers to obtain profits from production. The interest received by the bank generally accounts for only 8-21% of the net profit of production. Both the public and private sectors have favorable conditions for development. C. The physical objects recovered from the ordering loan are transferred to state-owned trading companies and sold at a price slightly lower than the market price, which can have the effect of stabilizing prices.

2.  Price-Linked Loans: Lending currency is converted into physical objects, and repayment is still converted into currency based on physical objects. Its basic spirit is the same as that of ordering loans, but this is a supplementary form, because although the scale of this type of factory is large, the product brand is unclear and the quality is not good. In order to help it improve production, the price-linking form is adopted. The types of price-linked goods are, in principle, mainly the main items related to the production of the industry, but it must be taken into account that the bank can break even and the factory can also benefit.

Although the deposit work of the Bank of Communications has explored a few experiences, there are still many shortcomings, such as:

1.  The understanding of the production process of various industries is not deep enough. Therefore, the term and interest of the loan are not accurately calculated and stipulated based on sufficient different production profits, turnover rates, and seasons, and therefore tend to be generalized. By early May, this rigid method was changed to determining the amount, term, and interest of the loan based on various different situations and the needs of the borrower.

2.  The loan procedures are not agile enough. For example, the provision that borrowers can only withdraw funds after providing a guarantor has often affected business. We believe that providing a guarantor is an indispensable procedure, but in application, it should be simplified and expedited but not flexible to avoid being deceived. This requires continued efforts to improve in the future.

    交通银行的存放业务
    平津两地交通银行为我接管后，其内部组织机构根据工作需要略加整顿改组后，于三月十五日同时开业，在当地中国人民银行领导下，专门办理对工矿、交通、邮电等事业的存放款等业务。
    在存款业务上，是采用了多种方式方法来开展的。如北平交通银行主动的向公营企业军事代表取得联系以开立存户、访问交通银行旧日往来户，向之解释，解除其疑虑，得以重建往来关系；向私营工厂阐明政府扶助有益于国民经济的私营企业发展的政策，以吸收其存款；同时用派员往存户指定地点收送款项、简化内部手续等办法给顾客以各种方便。在放款业务上，以定货、折实、质押、定期等形式向公私营企业办理放款；放款用途大部限于购买原料；在放款重点上则又以纺织、面粉、造纸、化学等行业为主，如天津交通银行自四月初至五月十二日贷出款项总额中，纺织业占３３．２９％，化学业占２３.１％，面粉业占１４．６％，造纸业占１３．２％，火柴业占８．４６％，铁业占３．９６％，油业占１．６７％。
    在贷款方式上，据天津交通银行四月一日至五月十二日统计，全部贷款中定货占８１％，折实占３１．５７％；从这个百分数上可以看出这一时期的贷款是以定货、折实为主要形式。因为这两种办法，无论物价涨或落借贷两方均无亏损，因而便利了生产的进行。兹分述如下：
    一、定货贷款：这是从“公私两利”出发的贷款办法之一种。工厂贷款时，银行除收一定的实物利息外，并向其订购约定质量数量的期货。定货种类以牌号明、销路广与军需民用关系密切的大路货为限。定货价格的计算亦因各厂生产过程、季节、市场等的不同而有所差异。例如：天津耀华玻璃公司于四月初开工后，玻璃销路欠畅，资金周转不灵，但又拟购存原料以保证生产的继续，遂于四月七日向天津交通银行商办定货贷款一笔，所定之每箱玻璃（其出售之标准箱以三袋通粉价格作标准）按当日价格计算，贷款货币月息六分；五月六日到期，银行将定货按耀华公司当日标价卖给信托公司，收回之本利如按该日通粉价格计算，银行尚赔实物９．８％，但大体上接近了保本，至于耀华公司，于取得贷款当日，即将所需原料买进，存货一时推销不动及缺乏资金的困难得以解决，每月产量由解放前的二万箱增至五万四千箱，达到了增加生产、降低成本的目的。
    这种定货贷款有这样几个好处：甲、可以充分发挥贷款对发展生产的效能，保证贷款用于生产，并带动私资积极活动。同时，这与信用贷款之物价越涨工厂越要求多贷的现象迥然相异，有实物债务的负担，对投机者也有控制作用。乙、确实做到了“公私两利”。银行掌握实物计算后，可长期的保持与不断增殖扶助生产的力量，减少货币发行；既有助于稳定物价，也可切实有效地解决真正缺乏生产资金的困难，并使贷户从生产中获得利润；银行所收利息一般的仅占生产纯利润的８—２１％，于公于私，都有顺利发展条件。丙、由定货贷款收回之实物，转让于国营贸易公司后，以稍低于市场价格出售，可收稳定物价之效。
    二、折实贷款：贷货币折成实物，归还时仍按实物折算货币，其基本精神与定货贷款一样，但这是一种辅助形式，因为这类工厂规模虽大，而产品牌号不明，质量不佳；为帮助其提高生产，乃采用折实形式。折实种类，原则上以与该业生产有关之主要物品为主，然必须照顾到银行能保本，厂方也有利。
    交通银行的存放工作虽摸索到了少许经验，但仍有很多缺点，比如：
    一、对各业生产的过程，了解不够深入，因此放款的期限、利息不是根据充分的从不同的生产利润、周转率与季节加以精确计算而后规定，因而有一般化的倾向。到五月上旬，这种呆板办法才改变为依据各种不同情况及贷款者的需要来决定贷款的数额、期限及利息。
    二、放款手续不够敏捷，如规定贷款者在对保以后才能取款一节，使业务往往因之受到一些影响，我们认为对保是不可减免的手续，然在运用中应力求简便迅速但不能灵活，以免受骗，这都需要今后继续努力改进。
