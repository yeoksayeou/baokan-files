　　The Pingjin Railway Bureau Dismissed and Investigated Five Staff Members for Violating Discipline
    [Our Newspaper] In the process of production and economy campaign, the Pingjin Railway Bureau strictly rectified discipline. Based on the feedback from the public, it was found that Zhao Yuanxi, a clerk at the Beijing Business Office, had previously colluded with former director Feng Dasheng and director Zhang Chongshan to use public funds to open the Shunli Coal Mine, used the office's vehicles for private purposes, falsely reported gasoline consumption, and extorted bribes from the beer company. Chief Clerk Li Huidong engaged in flattery and, together with Han Jiazhen and others, stole and sold flour belonging to customers. During the siege of Beijing, he seized the opportunity to steal and transport flour stored in the Guang'anmen warehouse. Clerk Meng Yujian colluded with hay merchants, issued false receipts, underreported quantities, and embezzled public funds; he also colluded with carriage drivers to operate illegal vehicles, causing the horses to be overworked and malnourished, leading to frequent deaths. Clerks Wang Guangdi and Liang Xiangsheng extorted money from merchants and oppressed colleagues. These five individuals have long been hated by all the employees of the office. After liberation, they still did not repent, often made strange remarks, made absurd statements, incited the masses, and affected unity and work. The Railway Bureau has repeatedly educated Zhao Yuanxi and the other four, but they were stubborn and unrepentant and could not be reformed. In order to rectify discipline, they have been dismissed and investigated, and the employees of the entire bureau have been educated.
