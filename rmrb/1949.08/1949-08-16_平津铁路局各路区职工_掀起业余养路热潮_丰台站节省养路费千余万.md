The Pingjin Railway Bureau's Employees in Various Sections Launch an Enthusiastic Mass Movement of Amateur Track Maintenance
    Fengtai Station Saves Over 10 Million in Track Maintenance Costs

    [Report from this newspaper] Since the Pingjin Railway Administration called on all sections of the railway to learn from Qin皇岛 (Qinhuangdao) Station and strengthen track maintenance, a movement to clean roadbeds has swept across various sections and stations in the railway over the past month. According to on-site investigations and reported materials, the track maintenance work has achieved significant results. All units at Fengtai Station implemented a joint mass labor effort, mobilizing over 4,000 employees and their families, determined to thoroughly clean the 50-kilometer line from Yongdingmen to Yangcun, and prepared to contribute 160,000 work-hours to give the station's road ballast, which had not been touched for ten years, a major overhaul, saving the people over 10 million in track maintenance costs. The Fengtai Engineering Section has established a plan to fully implement a track maintenance responsibility system, inspecting 40 kilometers of track, replacing sleepers, and driving spikes, guaranteeing that the safe train speed will increase to 90 kilometers per hour by September. At Tianjin North Station and East Station, every day during lunch breaks and after work, the tracks are filled with male and female employees, young and old family members, with the sounds of pickaxes and shovels, the movement of baskets and sieves, shouts and songs, like a temporary market. The stone ballast and sleepers have been renewed, and they are now making up for the small deficits. It is expected that the bulk of the work will be completed by the 15th of this month. At Beijing East Station and Xizhimen Station, not only were all railway employees mobilized, but the loading and unloading workers who were not formal railway employees also formed groups and shifts to participate in the challenging competition of sifting stone ballast. The Director of the Zhangjiakou Sub-bureau personally led all units, mobilizing over 2,000 employees, and 86 loading and unloading workers also participated in this glorious task. In Nankou, over 3,000 employees and their families were mobilized, and their work enthusiasm was extremely high, sometimes working until 12 o'clock at night. Currently, the leading cadres are not focusing on how to initiate and mobilize, but are instead exhorting everyone on how to save energy and pay attention to health. The movement has already begun in Datong and other stations along the PingSui Line. At the Qinglongqiao Guangou section, each person is responsible for 31 meters of roadbed, and everyone is working very hard. Over 1,500 people have been mobilized in Changxindian and have already started working, and the local government is also preparing to mobilize the masses to assist.

    In the track maintenance work in various regions, many active individuals have emerged. For example, Ren Yuxia, the wife of Cao Xinwu, a car number clerk at Langfang Station, goes to weed every day, which has played a role in promoting the work of employees. She also participated in the work when the station was repairing the switch tower, not afraid of mud or fatigue, and persisted for five days, transporting more than 5,000 bricks by herself. The wife of An Wenyun, a flying shift worker in Zhangjiakou, weeds 70 meters a day, and the wife of Li Qing, a foreman in Longjiazhuang, has weeded 500 meters. Eighteen family members participated in the weeding work at Tianzhen Station, weeding for four hours a day. They said, "We rely on the railway for our livelihood, and the railway is our family business. We are working for ourselves."

    The Railway Administration has sent telegrams of condolence to the families of employees and teachers of primary schools and called on everyone to continue to work hard under the three conditions of not hindering formal work hours, not being excessively tired, and not affecting learning, in order to victoriously complete this arduous task. The Railway Administration will also hold a meeting to summarize the achievements and experiences of this movement, to count the number of participants in this movement, the number of kilometers completed, the number of voluntary work hours used, and how much public expenditure has been saved, and the great role it has played in driving safety, improving transportation, and extending the life of sleepers.

　　平津铁路局各路区职工
  　掀起业余养路热潮
    丰台站节省养路费千余万
    【本报讯】平津铁路管理局自号召全路各地区职工向秦皇岛站学习加强养路工作后，月余以来，全路各地区各站段，已普遍掀起清理道床的运动。根据实地调查与汇报材料，养路工作已获显著成绩。丰台站各单位实行了联合大劳动，出动四千余职工及眷属，决心彻底清理永定门到杨村五十公里线路，并准备献出十六万个工时，把十年来没动过的站内道碴，来个大翻身，替人民省下千余万元的养路费。丰台工务段订好计划，全部实行养路负责制，甲检四十公里线路，换枕木打道钉，保证九月份提高到安全每小时行车九十公里。天津北站东站，每天中午与傍晚工余时间，线路上遍地是男女职工、老少家属，镐锹叮当，筐筛乱动，呼唤歌唱，好象临时闹市一样。石碴枕木已改旧观，现在正在找补零数，预计本月十五号即可大部完工。北平东站、西直门车站，不但铁路职工全体出动，非铁路正式员工的装卸工友们也分组分班，挑战竞赛，参加了筛石碴工作。张家口分局长亲自领导各单位出动了二千余职工，八十六名装卸工人也参加了这个光荣任务。南口出动三千余职工及家属，工作热情极高，有时干到夜十二点。目前领导干部已不是如何启发动员，而是劝勉着大家如何节省体力、注意健康。大同及平绥其他各站运动已经开始，青龙桥关沟段，每人分道床三十一米，大家干的很起劲。长辛店出动千五百余人，已开始工作，地方政府也准备动员群众协助。
    各地区在养路工作中已涌现不少积极人物，例如：廊房站车号员曹信武的妻子任玉霞，每天都去参加拔草，对职工起了推动作用，站上修转辙楼时她也参加工作，不怕泥土、不怕劳累，一直坚持了五天，一人搬运了五千多块砖。张家口飞班工友安文运的妻子，一天拔七十米，龙家庄工目李庆的妻子已拔草五百米长。天镇站参加拔草工作的家属十八名，每天拔草四小时，现已拔好二百八十米长，他们说：“我们依靠铁路生活，铁路就是咱们的家业，这是给自己干活。”
    路局对各线职工家属及扶小学生教师已发出慰问电，号召大家在不妨碍正式工作时间、不过度疲劳、不影响学习的三条件下继续努力，为胜利完成这一艰巨任务而奋斗。路局并将召开会议，总结这一运动的成绩与经验，统计这一运动的参加人数、完成里数、使用义务工时、节省公家多少开支，并对行车安全、提高运输、延长枕木寿命上起了多大作用。（人民铁道报社稿）
