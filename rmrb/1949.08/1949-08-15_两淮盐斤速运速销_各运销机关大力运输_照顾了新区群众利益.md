    [Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station broadcast] Huaibei News: All Huai Salt Transport and Sales Bureaus under the Two Huai Salt Administration actively transported, overcame difficulties, and completed the transport and sales tasks for the first half of the year. In the past six months, all transport and sales organs have transported a total of 2.3 million dan of edible salt and sold a total of 2,035,000 dan of salt, basically completing the task of rapid transport and sales. At the same time, due to the correct grasp of the sales and transport policy in various places, the large amount of salt sold absorbed a large amount of floating capital, which played a significant role in stabilizing prices, reduced the speculation and manipulation of market merchants, and cared for the interests of the masses in the new areas.
