    The Crimes of HMS Amethyst Must Be Punished
    The British warship HMS Amethyst, which committed serious crimes on April 20th, intruding into the Yangtze River, penetrating our army's defense line, shelling our army positions, and causing huge casualties, committed another serious crime on July 30th: it first sank the Chinese ship "Jiangling Jiefang," and then sank multiple rescue boats, causing the vast majority of the hundreds of passengers on the "Jiangling Jiefang" to drown in the river. The British warship HMS Amethyst, which committed such a serious crime, escaped by taking advantage of our army's rescue of passengers, while British Prime Minister Attlee and King George both sent telegrams to congratulate the ship's personnel on their "heroic achievements," "courage, skill, and determination"! As General Yuan Zhongxian said, the Chinese people will never forget this tragic event, and the Chinese people must mourn and avenge the compatriots who sacrificed on April 20th and July 30th!
    The entire process of the HMS Amethyst incident profoundly taught the Chinese people how ferocious, hypocritical, and shameless the imperialists are, regardless of which country they are from. The statement issued by the British Foreign Office and Admiralty on the 31st regarding this incident is a specimen of a hypocritical document. Although the clear and obvious fact is that the British warship intruded into China's inland river to shell the Chinese army, rather than the Chinese army running to the Thames to shell British warships, a fact that even British Far East Fleet Commander Brunt could not deny, the British government's statement actually said that admitting British responsibility for the incident is an unacceptable demand. The British government may think it has preserved its "face" in this negotiation, but this is an imperialist "face"! This ferocious face has since left an indelible impression in the minds of the Chinese people, just as it did in the past with the Shanghai Massacre in 1925 and the Wanxian Massacre in 1926. The American imperialist policy in China has already reaped its own bitter fruit, and British imperialism will inevitably reap the same bitter fruit.
    The Chinese people must continue to pursue the responsibility of HMS Amethyst, and must insist on severely punishing the two acts of violence committed by HMS Amethyst, as long as the British government exists! 【Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 31st】

### 紫石英号的罪行必须得到惩办

    紫石英号的罪行必须得到惩办
    在四月二十日犯了严重罪恶、侵入长江、侵入我军防线、炮击我军阵地、造成巨大伤亡的英国军舰紫石英号，在七月三十日又犯了一次严重罪恶：首先击沉中国轮船江陵解放号，然后又击沉了多艘救生的木船，致使江陵解放号的数百乘客绝大多数被淹毙江中。犯了如此重罪的英国军舰紫石英号，利用我军救护乘客的机会逃跑了，而英国首相艾德礼和英皇乔治则先后致电祝贺舰上人员的“英勇业绩”，“勇敢、巧妙和决心”！诚如袁仲贤将军所说，中国人民将永不忘记这一惨痛事件，中国人民必须为四月二十日和七月三十日牺牲的同胞致哀和复仇！
    紫石英号事件的全部过程，深刻地教训了中国人民，帝国主义者，无论是哪一国的帝国主义者，是何等的凶恶、虚伪和无耻。英国外交部和海军部在三十一日关于这一事件发出的公报是一个虚伪文件的标本。虽然明明白白的事实是英国军舰闯到中国内河来炮轰中国军队，而不是中国军队跑到泰晤士河去炮轰英国军舰，这个事实甚至英国远东舰队总司令布朗特也不能不承认，但是英国政府的公报居然说承认英国负事件的责任是一个不能接受的要求。英国政府也许自以为在这个交涉中保全了自己的“颜面”，但是这却是一个帝国主义的“颜面”！这个凶恶面貌却从此在中国人民心目中造成了不可磨灭的印象，如同过去在一九二五年上海惨案和一九二六年万县惨案所曾经造成的一样。美国帝国主义在中国的政策已经自食其果，英国帝国主义也必将同样地自食其果。
    中国人民必须继续追究紫石英号的责任，必须坚持严厉惩办紫石英号的两次暴行，只要英国政府还有一天存在着！        【新华社北平三十一日电】
