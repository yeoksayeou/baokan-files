    Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 3rd: Tokyo News: On the afternoon of August 1st, the Japanese government suddenly dispatched 1,000 police officers to search the Japanese Communist Party headquarters and the headquarters of the JCP's newspaper "Akahata" in Tokyo. During the search, the Japanese police "confiscated" many books and newspapers and arrested three communists. Prior to this, the Tokyo Police Department had arrested seven communists on the morning of the same day, falsely accusing them of being related to the so-called Mitaka (note: previously mistranslated as Mikata) train derailment case.
    Japanese Communist Party spokesperson Ritsu Ito issued a statement after the police search, denouncing this search as an act of oppression instigated by the Yoshida Cabinet with political conspiracies. JCP leader Sanzō Nosaka and other JCP representatives also went to Prime Minister Yoshida's official residence and police headquarters to lodge strong protests against the illegal atrocities of the Japanese police.

    斥责吉田内阁的政治阴谋
    【新华社北平三日电】东京消息：日本政府于八月一日下午突然出动警察一千名，大肆搜查在东京的日本共产党总部及日共机关报“赤旗报”总部。日本警察在搜查中“没收”了许多书报，并捕去共产党人三名。在此以前，东京警察局曾于同日上午逮捕共产党员七人，诬蔑他们与所谓三鹰（按：前误译为见高）车站火车出轨案有关。
    日本共产党发言人伊藤律在警察搜查后发表声明，斥责这种搜查是吉田内阁所指使的具有政治阴谋的压迫行为。日共领袖野坂参三及日共其他代表数人，也前往吉田首相官邸及警察总部，对日本警察的非法暴行提出强硬抗议。
