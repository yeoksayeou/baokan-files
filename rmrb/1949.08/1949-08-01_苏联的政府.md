    Li Ang

    The Soviet government, also known as the Council of Ministers of the USSR (formerly the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR before March 16, 1946), is the supreme executive and administrative organ of state power of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

    The Council of Ministers of the USSR is formed at a joint session of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, is responsible to and reports its work to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and, during the recess of the Supreme Soviet, is responsible to and reports its work to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

    The powers and composition of the Council of Ministers of the USSR are prescribed by the Constitution. It issues resolutions and directives on the basis of and for the implementation of existing all-Union laws, and reviews their implementation. Its resolutions and directives are binding throughout the Soviet Union.

    The powers of the Council of Ministers of the USSR include: unifying and directing the work of all-Union ministries, Union-Republic ministries, and other subordinate bodies; taking measures to implement national economic plans and the state budget, and consolidating the credit and monetary system; taking measures to maintain public order, protect state interests, and safeguard the rights of citizens; exercising general leadership in the field of foreign policy; determining the annual number of citizens to be drafted into military service, and directing the general construction of the national armed forces; and establishing, when necessary, specialized committees and general administrations under the Council of Ministers of the USSR to manage economic, cultural, and defense construction affairs.

    The Council of Ministers of the USSR includes: one Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR (currently Stalin), several Vice-Chairmen of the Council of Ministers of the USSR (currently Molotov, Andreyev, Voroshilov, Beria, Kosygin, Mikoyan, Yefremov, Tevosyan, and others), the Chairman of the State Planning Committee of the USSR (currently Saburov), the ministers of the various ministries of the Council of Ministers of the USSR (current ministers listed below), and the Chairman of the Arts Committee.

    The Soviet ministries are the organs in charge of state administration and national economic work in various departments, including all-Union ministries and Union-Republic ministries. The all-Union ministries directly administer the state administration work under their respective departments throughout the Soviet Union, either directly or through the affiliated bodies of the ministries. The Union-Republic ministries usually administer the state administration work under their respective departments through the ministries of the same name in the Union republics. For example, the Ministry of Light Industry of the USSR administers the light industry enterprises of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and other Union republics through the ministries of light industry of those republics.

    The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR issued an order on March 14, 1949, amending the constitutional provisions on Soviet ministries (Articles 77 and 78). According to this order, the all-Union ministries are (names in parentheses are the names of the current ministers; those not listed are unknown): Ministry of Aviation Industry, Ministry of Automobile and Tractor Industry, Ministry of Foreign Trade (Menshikov), Ministry of Armaments, Ministry of Geological Survey (Sakharov), Ministry of State Reserves of Grain and Materials (Fomin), Ministry of Procurement Affairs, Ministry of Machine and Instrument Building, Ministry of Metallurgical Industry (Tevosyan), Ministry of Maritime Transport (Novikov), Ministry of Oil Industry (Baibakov), Ministry of Postal and Telecommunications Equipment Industry, Ministry of Railways (Beshchev), Ministry of Inland Waterways, Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (Suprunov), Ministry of Agricultural Machine Building, Ministry of Machine Tool Building (Kostousov), Ministry of Construction and Road-Building Machine Building, Ministry of Construction of Machine-Building Enterprises (Dygai), Ministry of Construction of Heavy Industry Enterprises (Yudin), Ministry of Shipbuilding Industry, Ministry of Transport Machine Building, Ministry of Labor Reserves, Ministry of Heavy Machine Building, Ministry of Coal Industry (Zasyadko), Ministry of Chemical Industry (Beruzin), Ministry of Electrical Industry, Ministry of Power Stations; The Union-Republic ministries are: Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Armed Forces (Vasilevsky), Ministry of Higher Education (Kaftanov), Ministry of State Control (Mekhlis), Ministry of State Security, Ministry of Health (Smirnov), Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Vyshinsky), Ministry of Cinema (Bolshakov), Ministry of Light Industry (Kosygin), Ministry of Forestry (Bovin), Ministry of Timber and Paper Industry (Orlov), Ministry of Meat and Dairy Industry (Smirnov), Ministry of Food Industry (Zotov), Ministry of Building Materials Industry, Ministry of Fisheries (Ishkov), Ministry of Agriculture (Benediktov), Ministry of State Farms, Ministry of Trade (Zhevlonkov), Ministry of Finance (Zverev), Ministry of Justice. In addition, a new ministry was established in June of this year, called the All-Union Ministry of Urban Development, with the former Minister of Construction and Road-Building Machine Building, Sokolov, as the minister.

    The ministers of the various ministries in the Council of Ministers of the USSR are the sole administrators of the management work of their respective ministries. They issue orders and instructions within the scope of their respective ministries. The Council of Ministers of the USSR has the right to abolish the orders and instructions of the Soviet ministries and to suspend the resolutions and instructions of the Councils of Ministers of the Union republics in the management and economic work within the scope of Soviet power. Therefore, the Soviet government enjoys extremely broad powers in the management and leadership of the state and the entire state life. At the same time, all its actions are based on the laws of the entire Union and aimed at implementing these laws; all its activities are responsible to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and its Presidium, and it reports its work to them. The Council of Ministers of the USSR implements the will of the Soviet peoples reflected in the all-Union laws.

    Each Union republic and autonomous republic also has its own Council of Ministers, which is the supreme executive and administrative organ of state power of that republic. It is organized by the Supreme Soviet of the republic, is responsible to and reports its work to the Supreme Soviet of the republic, and, during the recess of the Supreme Soviet, is responsible to and reports its work to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Its powers and composition are prescribed by the constitution of the republic.

    理昂编
    苏联政府亦即苏联部长会议（一九四六年三月十六日以前则称苏联人民委员会），它是苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟国家政权的最高执行与号令机关。
    苏联部长会议是在苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议上组成的，对苏联最高苏维埃负责并报告工作，在最高苏维埃休会期间，则对苏联最高苏维埃主席团负责和报告工作。
    苏联部长会议的职权及其成份由宪法规定。它根据并为执行现行的全联盟法律，颁发决议和指令，并审查其执行情形。它的决议与指令在全苏联境内均须执行。
    苏联部长会议的职权计有：统一并指导全联盟各部、苏联联盟——共和国各部以及所属其他机关的工作；设法实现国民经济计划及国家预算，巩固信用与货币制度；设法维持公共秩序，保护国家利益，维护公民权利；实行外交方面的一般领导；规定每年应当征召入伍的公民数额，指导全国武装力量的一般建设；遇必要时，在苏联部长会议之下设立管理经济、文化、国防建设事宜的各专门委员会及总管理局。
    苏联部长会议包括：苏联部长会议主席一人（现为斯大林），苏联部长会议副主席若干人（现为莫洛托夫、安德列也夫、伏罗希洛夫、贝利亚、柯西金、米高扬、叶菲列莫夫、提伏希安及其他等人），苏联国家计划委员会主席（现为萨布罗夫），苏联部长会议各部部长（现任部长见后），艺术委员会主席。
    苏联各部是主持各部门国家管理和国民经济工作的机关，包括全联盟各部和联盟——共和国各部。全联盟各部在全苏联境内直接或经过各该部附属机关主持各该部所属的国家管理工作。联盟——共和国各部通常要经过加盟共和国同一名称的各部去主持各该部所属的国家管理工作。例如苏联轻工业部通过俄罗斯联邦、乌克兰及其他加盟共和国的轻工业部去主持各该加盟共和国的轻工业企业。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团于一九四九年三月十四日曾颁布命令修改关于苏联各部的宪法条文（第七十七、七十八两条），根据此项命令，全联盟各部为（括弧中者为现任部长姓氏，未列者不详）：航空工业部、汽车与拖拉机工业部、对外贸易部（孟希科夫）、军器制造部、地质调查部（萨哈洛夫）、国家粮食与物资储存部（佛明）、采办事宜部、机器与仪器制造部、冶金工业部（提伏西安）、海上运输部（诺维科夫）、石油工业部（巴伊巴科夫）、邮电用品工业部、铁道部（别什切夫）、内河航运部、邮电部（苏普尔且夫）、农业机器制造部、母机制造部（科斯托索夫）、建造及筑路机器制造部、机器制造企业建设部（德加伊）、重工业企业建设部（犹定）、造船工业部、运输机器制造部、劳动后备部、重型机器制造部、煤业部（扎霞迪科）、化学工业部（别尔乌辛）、电气工业部、电站部；联盟—共和国各部为：内政部、武装力量部（华西列夫斯基）、高等教育部（卡夫坦诺夫）、国家管制部（米赫利斯）、国家保安部、卫生部（斯米尔诺夫）、外交部（维辛斯基）、电影事业部（鲍尔沙诺夫）、轻工业部（柯西金）、林业部（鲍文）、木材与造纸工业部（奥尔洛夫）、肉乳工业部（史密尔诺夫）、食品工业部（佐托夫）、建筑材料工业部、鱼品工业部（伊施科夫）、农业部（比尼迪克托夫）、国营农场部、商务部（热伏隆科夫）、财政部（兹维列夫）、司法部。此外，今年六月间另成立一新部，名为全苏城市发展部，部长为原任建造及筑路机器制造部部长索科洛夫。
    苏联部长会议中的各部部长是各该部管理工作的唯一主持人。他在各该部权限以内颁发命令和训令。苏联部长会议在苏联权限以内的管理及经济工作方面，有权废除苏联各部的命令及训令和停止各加盟共和国部长会议的决议及指令。因此，苏联政府在管理和领导国家及整个国家生活方面，享有极广泛的全权。同时它的一切行动则以全联盟的法律为根据，并以执行这些法律为目的；它的全部活动对苏联最高苏维埃及其主席团负责并且它向它们报告工作。苏联部长会议执行全联盟法律中所反映的苏联各民族的意志。
    每一加盟共和国及自治共和国也各有其自己的部长会议，为各该共和国国家政权的最高执行与号令机关。它由各该共和国最高苏维埃组织之，对各该共和国最高苏维埃负责并报告工作，在各该最高苏维埃休会期间则对各该最高苏维埃主席团负责并报告工作，其职权和成份由各该共和国宪法规定。
