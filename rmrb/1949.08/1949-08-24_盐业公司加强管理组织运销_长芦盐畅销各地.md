The Salt Company Strengthens Management, Organizes Transportation and Sales
　　Changlu Salt Sells Well Across the Country
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Changlu Salt Company of the North China Trade Corporation recently studied its business operations since its establishment. After its formal establishment on March 14, the company vigorously developed the Changlu salt market. Based on the economic environment and transportation conditions, it divided the sales areas and successively established branches in Beiping, Shijiazhuang, and Xinxiang, as well as sub-branches in Zhangjiakou, Linqing, Handan, Baoding, and Taiyuan, and two promotion offices in Datong and Shacheng. It also set up several consignment shops at water and land terminals and commercial centers in Tianjin, Beiping, and other places to facilitate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. By the end of July, it had sold a total of 3,298,823 dan of salt. The total transportation volume of Tianjin Company alone reached 63,550.17 tons. In addition to obtaining most of the North China market (still part of Lu salt and Bohai salt), it also actively strived for the foreign sales market. As of the end of July, the total amount of salt transferred to friendly districts, both transported and not yet transported, was more than 1,152,000 dan, including 1,000,000 dan to the Central China District, 60,000 dan to Rehe Province, and more than 92,000 dan to the East China District.

　　In the process of business development, the company actively supported production, enabling many salt farms and salt factories to recover and develop rapidly. It provided 500,000 jin of grain as loans to help the state-owned China Salt Industry Corporation's salt farms to start sun-drying, and purchased the refined salt from the privately-owned Jiuda Salt Industry Company's salt factory to support its production. It successively purchased 4,191,472 dan of crude salt from salt field merchants, enabling the salt fields to start spring drying quickly. In the purchase of salt, it invested a total of 847.8 million yuan (nearly half of which was in grain).

　　The price of salt in North China has been greatly reduced compared to before liberation.

　　In addition, the company also paid attention to the unification of salt prices throughout the region, so that the salt prices in various places have an appropriate and reasonable difference based on the law of transportation circulation and cost calculation, in order to facilitate the exchange of goods. This reversed the abnormal phenomenon of high salt prices in the producing areas and low salt prices in the selling areas before early May, which caused the sales of salt to be stagnant, and greatly enlivened the private merchants' declarations.

　　In summarizing the experience of the first half of the year and work inspection, the company studied several issues that need to be resolved in its work:

　　First, to uniformly and rationally control the salt price in the whole region, it is necessary to accurately calculate the cost. At present, there are still shortcomings such as inconsistent calculation cost items and methods, as well as being not meticulous and accurate. In particular, the cost of sacks is too high, which is not suitable for farmers' needs, and needs to be checked and improved.

　　Second, the relationship with private merchants is not clear. It has not paid attention to actively leading private merchants through the market to achieve favorable commodity allocation in order to develop the sales of Changlu salt.

　　Third, the efforts used to support cooperatives are small, and the methods are simple. It only negatively emphasizes cash on delivery, fearing that the cooperative's credit will affect the capital turnover, and has not thought of more ways to actively support them.

　　The organizational setup is also not very suitable for the policy of actively expanding the Changlu salt market by vigorously promoting sales to the outside world. For example, markets in areas such as Datong, Taiyuan, and Xinxiang can be opened up, but the organizational structure is too weak and there are too few cadres. Based on the work review, the post-rainy season plan was discussed, and it was proposed to continue to vigorously promote Changlu salt with the principle of small profits and quick turnover, emphasizing the use of various methods to support cooperatives, unite and lead private merchants, and improve operations.

　　盐业公司加强管理组织运销
  　长芦盐畅销各地
    【本报讯】华北贸易总公司长芦盐业公司日前研究该公司成立以来营业情况。该公司自三月十四日正式成立后即大力开拓芦盐市场，根据经济环境与交通条件，划分了销区，并先后建立北平、石家庄、新乡分公司及张家口、临清、邯郸、保定、太原支公司，大同、沙城二推销处，并于天津、北平等地水陆码头及商业中心设立代销店多处，以便利城乡物资交流。经营到七月底，共销出盐斤计三、二九八、八二三担，仅天津公司运输总额即达六三、五五○·一七吨。除取得了华北大部市场（尚有一部潞盐与渤海盐）外，并积极争取外销市场，截止七月份止，友区调剂已运未运的共一百一十五万二千余担，计华中区一百万担，热河省六万担，华东区九万二千余担。
    该公司在业务发展中，并积极的扶植了生产，使许多盐滩盐厂得到了迅速地恢复与发展。曾以贷粮五十万斤扶助国营中国盐业公司盐滩开晒，又收购私营久大盐业公司盐厂的洗涤盐，扶助其生产，在海滩对场商先后收购粗盐四、一九一、四七二担，使盐滩迅速开始春晒。在收购盐中先后投入资金八亿四千七百余万元（将近一半是粮食）。
    华北盐价已较解放前大为降低。
    此外该公司并注意全境盐价的统一，使各地盐价根据运输流转规律及成本计算，有一适当合理的差额，以利物资交流，扭转了在五月上旬以前的产地盐价高、销地盐价低使盐斤销路发生滞塞的不正常现象，而使私商报运大大活跃起来。
    该公司在总结上半年经验及工作检查中，研究出工作中需要解决的几个问题：
    首先，要统一合理的掌握全境盐价，必须精确的计算成本。目前尚存在着计算成本科目与方法不一致以及不细密不精确的缺点，特别是麻袋成本太高，不适合农民要求，需加检查改善。
    其次，是与私商关系不明确，没注意通过市场积极领导私商，达到有利于商品的调剂，以开拓芦盐销路。
    第三，对合作社的扶植上用的力量较小，方法简单，只消极地强调现款现货，怕合作社赊欠影响到资金周转，没有从积极方面多想办法，来加以扶持。
    在组织设置上，也不大适合大量向外推销积极开拓芦盐市场的方针，如大同、太原、新乡等地区市场可以开辟，但组织机构太弱，干部太少。根据工作检讨，讨论了雨季后的计划，并提出继续以薄利多销方针，大量推销长芦盐，强调用各种方式扶植合作社，团结与领导私商，改善经营。
