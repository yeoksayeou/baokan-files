　　Locomotive Coal Consumption Standards
  　Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau to Implement Trial Next Month
    [Our Newspaper] The Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau has recently formulated locomotive coal consumption standards and issued an order for trial implementation throughout the railway system in September and October, with formal implementation starting in November. Since June, the bureau has sent personnel to various lines to test locomotive coal consumption standards. Based on two months of experience, they have formulated locomotive coal consumption standards for various vehicles under various conditions. For ordinary train operation, the standard is calculated in terms of converted kilometers (the total weight of the vehicles pulled by the locomotive, every 43.5 tons traveling one kilometer, is one converted kilometer). The standard coal consumption for each converted kilometer ranges from 0.75 kilograms to 3 kilograms. For single-engine operation, large locomotives consume 15 kilograms to 17 kilograms, while small locomotives consume 11 kilograms to 13.6 kilograms. In addition, standards have been set for coal consumption for shunting, pumping air, and locomotives in the engine house.
    During the trial period, the railway bureau requires employees of each section to study and discuss the actual driving conditions and provide opinions for correction; at the same time, the "Provisional Measures for Rewarding Coal Saving" have been announced, stipulating that those whose monthly coal consumption is lower than the standard will be commended and rewarded according to their performance. 　　　　(Liu Lin)

　　机车用煤标准量
  　平津路局定下月起试行
    【本报讯】平津铁路局顷制定机车用煤标准量，通令全路在九、十两月份试行，十一月份起正式执行。该局自六月间起，即派人赴各线试验机车用煤标准量，根据两月来经验，分别制定了各种车辆在各种情况下的机车用煤标准量。普通行车以换算公里为单位（机车所拉的车辆全重量每四十三吨半行一公里为一换算公里）计算。普通每一换算公里的标准用煤量由零点七五公斤到三公斤；单机行驶，大型机车普通十五公斤到十七公斤，小型机车十一公斤至十三点六公斤。此外调车、泵风，在车房的机车等用煤量亦均定了标准。
    在试行期间，路局要求各段职工根据实际行车情况，研究讨论，提出意见，以便改正；同时公布了机煤节约奖励试行办法，规定每月结算用煤低于标准量者按成绩分别表扬奖励。  　　　　（柳林）
