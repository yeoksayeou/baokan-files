    We, a part of us are storytellers and street performers (that is, Quyi workers), and a part of us are willing to help with this kind of work. We are very happy that this National Congress of Literary and Art Workers invited representatives from the Quyi community to participate. People in this field have always been engaged in literary and artistic work, but before liberation, they were never considered to be in the circle of literature and art. This time, it can be considered a turning over.

    After this Congress of Literary and Art Workers, all the representatives of literary and artistic workers unanimously felt that literature and art should serve the masses. Starting from this idea, we felt the importance of Quyi even more: how many storytellers and street performers are there in China? Although there are no statistical figures (some estimate about 100,000), this kind of art influence is very popular—who hasn't heard storytelling or seen acrobatics?

    With so many people and such a wide range of people being approached, it is just right to serve the masses. Unfortunately, because it was not valued in the past, it left two major problems. If it is not reformed, it will not be able to bear this important task. These two major problems are one on the art itself, and one on the performers. In art: whether it is the script of the story, or the idle talk in acrobatics, it has been created many years ago and passed down from master to apprentice to the present—although some artist friends have added some timely components at any time, not many are in line with the interests of the masses, because the past society was the world of landlords, bureaucrats, warlords, and compradors. Things that are beneficial to the masses are harmful to them, and they will interfere if they are added. Therefore, the old works that have been handed down are probably not able to serve the masses in the future. In terms of the performers: these artist friends have to rely on storytelling and performing to make a living, so they have to support those who pay. In the past, most people lived very hard and had little spare time. Artist friends could not maintain their lives by relying on them alone, so they had to treat the lackeys, sons, and grandsons of landlords, bureaucrats, warlords, and compradors as patrons, because those guys had time and money. But those guys never regarded people as human beings. Whoever wanted to spend their money had to suffer their anger. Artist friends had to endure their anger to please them, accept their insults with a smile, because they had to eat. Over time, they not only didn't want to compete with others for status, but thought it was their destined identity. Therefore, they created a unique ideology and lifestyle for themselves, and they didn't pay attention to anything. It would be difficult to ask them to immediately serve the masses of the new society. If these two problems are not thoroughly reformed, not only will they not be able to serve the masses of the new society, but they will become the dregs of the new society, which will be harmful to themselves and the masses.

    It is because of these reasons that we are preparing to establish this improvement association. We feel that such a large number of literary and artistic workers who can approach the masses, as long as they can change those two major problems and actively write and sing new things that can serve the new democratic society, will be a ready-made cultural army for the new society.

    However, this work is too big, and a few people can't do much. We can set up a small stall first to do some preparatory work. If we want to carry out large-scale activities, we have to invite more friends to participate. We hope that the advanced people in the Quyi community and other friends who are willing to help will participate in our small group, so that our wishes can be realized as soon as possible.

### 中国曲艺改进会筹备缘起

    中国曲艺改进会筹备缘起
    我们这些人，一部分是说书卖艺的（就是曲艺工作者），一部分是情愿对这种工作帮忙的。这次全国文代大会聘请曲艺界派代表参加，我们觉着很高兴。这一界的人，向来就作的是文学艺术工作，可是在解放以前，向来不曾被算到文学艺术的圈子里，这次可算翻了一下身。
    这次文代大会开过后，所有的文学艺术工作者代表们，都一致感觉到文学艺术应该为大众服务，从这种思想出发，使我们更感到曲艺之重要：全中国有多少说书卖艺的，虽然没有数字的统计（有人估计约在十万左右），可是这种艺术影响，是很普及的——谁还没有听过说书或看过玩杂技的呢？
    有那样多的人，接近的群众又是那样广泛，正好为大众服务，可惜因为过去不被人重视，留下两个很大的毛病，要不改造一下，是担负不起这个重大任务来的。这两大毛病，一个是艺术本身上的，一个是作艺人身上的。在艺术上：不论是书词的底本，不论是杂技中的闲话，都是从好多年前就被创造出来经过师徒相传一直传到现在的——其中虽然也有些作艺的朋友们随时加了些应时的成份，可是合乎大众利益的不多，因为过去的社会是地主、官僚、军阀、买办们的天下，对大众有利的东西都对他们有害，加进去他们便要干涉，因此流传下来的旧作品，大概都不能为今后的大众服务。在作艺人方面：这些作艺的朋友们因为要靠说书卖艺过日子，就不得不为出钱的人捧场。在过去，大多数群众生活都很苦，闲工夫也不多，作艺的朋友们光靠他们维持不了生活，就不得不把地主、官僚、军阀、买办们的狗腿子干儿孙们当作主顾，因为那些家伙们一有工夫二有钱。可是那批家伙们，向来不把人当成人看待，谁想花他们的钱，就不得不受他们的气。作艺的朋友们因为要吃饭，就只好忍着气来讨他们的欢心，陪着笑脸接受他们的侮辱，日子久了，不只不想再和人家争什么地位，反以为这是命定的身份，因此便给自己造成一种特有的思想意识与生活习惯，什么也不讲究，要说叫他们马上来为新社会的大众服务，也很困难。以上这两种毛病，如果不彻底改造，不只不能为新社会的大众服务，反而成为新社会的渣子，对自己对大众都有好多害处。
    就因为这些原因，我们才准备成立这个改进会。我们觉着这样数量广大又会接近群众的文学艺术工作者，只要能把那两个大毛病改过，积极来编写说唱能为新民主主义社会服务的新东西，就是新社会一支现成的文化大军。
    不过这件工作太大了，光凭少数人办不了多少事。我们现在可以先摆开个小摊子，作一作准备工作，想要大规模开展，还得请更多的朋友们来参加，希望曲艺界的先进者和其他各界愿意帮忙的朋友们，多多来参加我们这个小小的团体，以便使我们的愿望早日实现。
