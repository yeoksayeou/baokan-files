Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 25th: TASS, Moscow, August 23rd: *Pravda* published an editorial entitled "From Socialism to Fascism" regarding the Soviet government's reply to the Yugoslav note, stating: The Soviet government's reply completely exposes that the Yugoslav government has become a government that betrays the cause of democracy and socialism, and relies on foreign capital and the reactionary camp. In a short period, the Tito bourgeois nationalist clique, in its foreign and domestic policies, has completed the entire journey of selling out the interests of the Yugoslav people, and finally joined the camp that is diametrically opposed to the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the entire international communist movement.

The Soviet government's reply reveals the true reason for the persecution of Soviet citizens in Yugoslavia. This is because Soviet citizens, along with all Yugoslav patriots, advocate friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and oppose the well-known unforgivable behavior of the Yugoslav government in abandoning the democratic and socialist camp and relying on the international capitalist camp. In present-day Yugoslavia, the secret police rule everything, all free expression of thought and all human rights are trampled upon, Yugoslav prisons are filled with supporters of the socialist camp, and the Yugoslav Communist Party has become a political police department under the control of police chief Ranković. All this can determine the nature of the regime that rules Yugoslavia today. This regime has nothing in common with socialism and democratic people's power. On the contrary, it is a fascist secret police-style regime.

　　真理报论苏联再次致南照会
  　“从社会主义到法西斯主义”
    铁托集团背叛民主阵营南国政权已成特务统治
    【新华社北平二十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯，真理报就苏联政府对南复文发表题为“从社会主义到法西斯主义”的社论说：苏联政府的复文完全揭穿了南斯拉夫政府已成为一个背叛民主事业和社会主义事业，投靠外国资本与反动阵营的政府。在短短的一段时间中，铁托资产阶级民族主义集团在其外交及内政政策上，都已走完了出卖南斯拉夫人民利益的全部路程，终于加入了与苏联、人民民主国家及整个国际共产主义运动誓不两立的阵营里。
    苏联政府的复文揭露了南斯拉夫境内苏联公民遭受迫害的真正原因，这就是苏联公民与南斯拉夫所有爱国者一起都主张苏联与南斯拉夫间的友好关系，而反对众所周知的背弃民主与社会主义阵营、依附国际资本阵营的南斯拉夫政府这种不可饶恕的行为。在目前的南斯拉夫，秘密警察正统治一切，一切思想的自由表现和一切的人权都受着蹂躏，南斯拉夫牢狱里充斥着社会主义阵营的拥护者，而南斯拉夫的共产党，却已变成警察头子兰科维奇手下的政治警察部了。这一切就可以确定统治着今日南斯拉夫的政权的性质，这政权与社会主义及民主的人民政权毫无相同之点，恰恰相反，这是法西斯秘密警察式的政权。
