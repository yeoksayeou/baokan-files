How the Northeast Educational Community Can Learn from the Soviet Union
    Zhang Jian
    At a time when Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations are being established throughout the country to carry out mass movements to enhance the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, and to call on people to learn from the Soviet Union, I would like to introduce to readers what I know about the Northeast educational community learning from the Soviet Union.
    I. Three Aspects of Learning from the Soviet Union
    First, introducing the Soviet Union's experience in educational construction and translating theoretical works. At the beginning of this year, the Education Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee entrusted someone to purchase dozens of books on education from the Soviet Union, including principles of education, psychology, teaching methods, and primary and secondary school textbooks, which are currently being translated by the translation group of the department's compilation and review office. In addition, the Harbin Municipal Education Bureau and the Liaoda Administrative Office Education Department have people responsible for translation, and the Northeast Foreign Language College is also actively participating in this work. It is estimated that all of them will be translated soon. Some have already been partially translated, such as the primary school natural teaching method, which has begun to be published in "Northeast Education" on a regular basis, and others are also being prepared for publication. Recently, "Northeast Education" is also preparing to publish a special issue introducing Soviet education in order to arouse the Northeast educational community's attention to learning from the Soviet Union. The Guandong Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has now published Friendship Series No. 17 - "On Soviet Education" compiled by Comrade Jiang Shan, "Lectures on Soviet School Education" translated by Comrade Xiao Ying of the former Andong Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department, and "Thirty Years of Education in the Soviet Union" translated by Comrade Liao Yi, and other educational pamphlets, which have begun to circulate among educators in Northeast China. "Introduction to the Soviet Union" edited by the Harbin Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and "Translation Monthly" published by the Northeast Bookstore regularly publish news, historical materials, experiences, and theoretical works on Soviet culture and education.
    Second, actually observing typical experiments. The Soviet expatriates in Harbin and Dalian run several primary and secondary schools for their children, among which the Soviet "Complete Middle School" in Lushun is the most formal. Before I came to Beijing, I visited it in mid-July. Unfortunately, the school was already on summer vacation, and the students had gone to seaside summer camps or to the mountains to collect specimens. I only visited the school's teaching library and equipment. For example, the chemistry laboratory has 1,003 kinds of experimental drugs, 2,000 kinds of physics instruments and equipment, and 1,000 kinds of biological specimens. In addition to storage rooms, there are also classrooms specially set up for physics, chemistry, and biology courses. In addition, the school has a biology room where dozens of kinds of insects and animals are raised, and a campus where more than 20 kinds of crops with teaching significance are planted, all of which are managed by student study groups on a rotating basis. According to the person in charge of the school, the state spares no expense in providing a large amount of teaching equipment to increase students' rich scientific knowledge, so that every student has the opportunity to make actual observations and scientific experiments. They usually automatically invite comrades from the education circles in the Lushun-Dalian area to visit, and exchange teaching experiences with each other. Our teacher comrades have gained great inspiration from the actual observation and borrowed the strengths of Soviet schools to improve their own weaknesses. What needs to be mentioned here is that our "Lushun Middle School" has made great improvements in its teaching work with the help and influence of Soviet friends. The school lacked equipment, and the "Soviet Middle School" generously donated equipment to them. When the school buildings were damaged and wood was needed for repairs, Soviet friends allocated a part of the wood they urgently needed to the school. They also sincerely suggested how to improve the shortcomings of the school. This year, with the help of Soviet friends, the school built a brand-new auditorium, and the school buildings and appearance were also renovated. This year, the Liaoda Administrative Office Education Department decided to use "Lushun Middle School" as a model for learning from the Soviet experience in teaching, so the school began to experiment with new Soviet teaching methods from the last semester, such as adopting the Soviet "five-point system" scoring method in examinations, instead of the "percentage system" that has been popular in capitalist countries and China for decades. The characteristics of the "five-point system" are: 1. Pay attention to students' usual grades in order to overcome the problems of not working hard on weekdays, cramming before exams, and taking opportunistic tricks and cheating on exams. 2. Pay attention to cultivating students' collectivist concepts, and overcome the score-ism and medal-ism in examinations (the "five-point system") does not distinguish between first and second place. 3. Score by subject, so that students know their strengths and weaknesses in learning, so as to determine how to work hard to overcome their weaknesses. This reform initially encountered ideological resistance from individual teachers who felt that the "five-point system" was not easy to implement and was not as convenient as the "percentage system." After the trial implementation, everyone realized that the "five-point system" was much more scientific than the "percentage system." There are many places where the school learns from the Soviet Union, which will not be described here one by one. After the Fourth Education Conference, the Northeast Education Department plans to organize education cadres from various provinces to visit Soviet primary and secondary schools and social education activities in Lushun and Dalian in succession, so that everyone can learn from the experience and improve their work.
    Third, vigorously cultivate Russian translation talents. As early as the Third Northeast Education Conference in the autumn of last year, the Northeast Administrative Committee decided to add Russian classes to middle schools in large and medium-sized cities. In July of this year, it was stipulated that Russian should be the first foreign language that must be studied in universities and colleges. In addition, as early as 1947, a Russian specialized school (recently changed to a foreign language specialized school) was established in Harbin, with more than 1,500 students. Harbin Medical University, Northeast University, and other schools have Russian departments in order to cultivate a large number of Russian translation talents and create favorable conditions for learning and introducing the experiences of socialist Soviet construction in various fields; at the same time, they also train Russian teachers for schools at all levels. In short, due to the convenient transportation in the Northeast region adjacent to the Soviet Union, and the more opportunities for exchanges between the Chinese and Soviet people in history and at present than in other regions, learning from the Soviet Union does have a "unique advantage."
    II. A Brief Discussion on the Attitude that Should Be Taken When Learning from the Soviet Union
    The Soviet Union is the world's first socialist country. It has paid attention to absorbing the excellent achievements of all mankind in various fields in the past and present. After the test of the civil war and the Second World War, and the construction of the four five-year plans before and after, its achievements in various fields are truly extraordinary and great. Now, the people of the world recognize it as the savior of mankind and the strong fortress of peace and democracy; it is the locomotive for mankind to move forward, and if we want to make progress, we can only follow it. That is to say, we must be good at humbly learning from the Soviet Union. We must realize that learning from the experience of the Soviet socialist education cause is one of the necessary conditions for building China's new democratic education cause; it is wrong to underestimate learning from the Soviet Union's experience in education.
    Chairman Mao educates us that learning should be realistic and aim at the target. Learning from the Soviet Union should also be based on this Marxist-Leninist scientific attitude. That is to say, when learning from the Soviet Union, we must be good at paying attention to absorbing their valuable experience that is applicable to us according to China's current environment and conditions, so as to better improve our work. This requires us to be good at distinguishing between the fundamental policies and specific facilities of the Soviet Union in education. In specific facilities, there are successful experiences (which is the main aspect) and failed lessons (which is the secondary aspect). Among the successful experiences, we must also distinguish between those that can be implemented in China at present and those that can only be done in the future. If we learn indiscriminately without distinction and transplant everything regardless of specific conditions, we will make the mistake of dogmatism.
    According to my personal experience in learning, the Soviet Union clearly stipulates that education should serve politics, that is, the proletarian revolution, socialist construction, and the communist cause, and that the specific facilities of education should be closely integrated with social production labor and political life, so that education can adapt to the policy of serving the working people. The mutual connection between school education and social education, the regularization of the education system, the teaching method emphasizes the increase of students' perceptual knowledge of objects in order to help them understand rational knowledge. The "five-point system" is implemented in examinations, attention is paid to pre-school kindergarten education and family education, and it is organically coordinated with primary and secondary school education, and emphasis is placed on students' patriotic education and the cultivation of new morality and discipline. Inspire students' self-awareness in learning and guide their extracurricular democratic and autonomous study group activities, care about their physical and mental development and health, and develop hygiene habits. Primary and secondary school education should be continuous and unified, implement co-education, and teachers should follow classes in primary school for four years. Attach importance to the training of teachers, improve their living standards and social status; be extremely responsible for compiling and reviewing textbooks and providing a large number of rich extracurricular readings; the scientificization of school construction equipment..., these are all successful facilities of the Soviet Union in education, which are beyond the reach of any capitalist country. These are all worthy of our long-term learning in the future.
    Among them, some facilities cannot be achieved today due to objective conditions, such as the scientificization of school equipment, the high salaries of teachers, etc. It should be known that the achievements of the Soviet Union today are by no means achieved overnight, but are the results of more than 30 years of construction. China will also strive to catch up in the future. In addition, when learning from the Soviet Union, we should also pay attention to summarizing our own successful experiences and organically combine the two in the process of building a new education cause; it is also wrong to only pay attention to others and ignore our own successful experiences.
    Finally, I hope that Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various places can organize and help the education circles learn from the Soviet Union in a planned way, so as to benefit the development of China's new democratic education cause.

　　东北教育界如何向苏联学习
    张健
    适在全国各地成立中苏友好协会，开展群众性的增进中苏人民友谊运动，和号召向苏联学习的时候，兹将笔者所知东北教育界向苏联学习的情形，向读者介绍一下。
    一、向苏联学习的三个方面
    第一、介绍苏联在教育方面建设的经验和翻译理论著述。东北行政委员会教育部，今年初托人从苏联购到数十种关于教育方面的书籍，其中包括教育学原理、心理学、教学法及中小学教材，现正由该部编审处翻译组负责翻译中；此外哈尔滨市教育局和旅大行署教育厅皆有负责翻译的人，东北外国语专门学校也正积极参加此项工作，估计不久将会全部译出。有些现已译出一部分，如小学自然教学法，已开始在“东北教育”上按期发表，其他的也准备刊载。近来“东北教育”还准备出一期苏联教育介绍专号；以便引起东北教育界重视向苏联学习。关东中苏友好协会现已出版友谊丛书之十七——江山同志编译的“论苏联教育”，原安东省委宣传部小英同志翻译的“苏联学校教育讲座”，辽逸同志翻译的“苏联三十年来的教育”等教育小册子，现已开始流传到东北教育工作者之手。哈尔滨市中苏友好协会主编的“苏联介绍”和东北书店出版的“翻译月刊”，经常登载着苏联文化教育方面的消息、史料、经验及理论著述。
    第二、实际观摩典型试验。哈尔滨和旅大地区的苏联侨民，皆为其子女办理数处中小学校，其中尤以旅顺市苏联“完全中学”办理得最为正规。笔者来平前，曾于七月中旬前往参观过，不巧该校已放暑假，学生已到海滨夏令营或到山地采集标本去了，仅参观到该校教学上的图书仪器设备。例如化学之试验室就有各种试验药品一千零三种，物理仪器设备有二千种，生物标本一千数百种，除各有一个贮藏室外，还各有专为上物理、化学、生物课程而特设的教室。此外，学校尚有一个生物室，里边养育着数十种昆虫和动物，另有一处校园，种植着有教学意义的二十余种农作物，都由学生学习小组轮班负责管理。据该校负责人谈称：国家为着增进学生丰富的科学知识，不惜支拨大量的教学设备费，以便使每个学生都有实际观察和作科学实验的机会。他们平日都自动约请旅大地区教育界同志前往参观，彼此交换教学经验。而我们的教师同志们，就在实际观摩中得到极大的启示，借用苏联学校之长来改进自己之短。在这里需要特别说一下的，就是我们的“旅顺中学”，在苏联友人帮助和影响下，教学工作有很大的改进。该校缺少仪器，“苏联中学”就慷慨赠送给他们仪器。校舍坏了，修建缺木材，苏联友人就从自己急需用的木材中，拨送一部给该校。他们并诚挚地建议如何改进该校存在的缺点。今年该校在苏联友人帮助下，修建成一座崭新的大礼堂，校舍和校容也整顿得焕然一新。今年旅大行署教育厅决定把“旅顺中学”作为在教学上学习苏联经验的典型，故该校自上学期起，就开始试验苏联教学上的新方法，例如考试上采用苏联的“五分制”记分法，而代替了过去资本主义国家和中国流行数十年的“百分法”。“五分制”的特点是：一、注重学生平日成绩，以克服平日不用功，临考开夜车，及考试上的投机取巧、耍鬼作弊等毛病。二、注意养成学生集体主义观念，而克服考试上的分数主义、锦标主义（“五分制”）不分第一名第二名。三、分科记分，使学生知道自己学习的优缺点何在，以便确定自己如何努力克服缺点。这种改革起初也曾遇到个别教师的思想抗拒，觉得“五分制”不好搞，不如“百分制”方便，经过试行后，就使大家认识到“五分制”是比“百分制”科学得多。该校向苏联学习的地方很多，此处不再一一叙述。东北教育部准备在第四次教育会议后，组织各省教育干部，陆续到旅大参观苏联中小学校和社会教育活动，以便大家吸取经验、改进自己的工作。
    第三、大量培养俄文翻译人材。远自去年秋天东北三次教育会议时，东北行政委员会就确定在大中城市中学里增设俄文课。今年七月间又规定俄文为高等学校必修的第一外国文，除此之外，远自一九四七年，就在哈尔滨市设立一处俄文专科学校（近改为外国语专门学校），现有学员一千五百余名。哈尔滨医科大学、东北大学等校都设有俄文系，以便大量的培养俄文翻译人才，造成学习和介绍社会主义苏联各种建设经验的有利条件；同时也替各级学校培养了俄文教员。总之由于东北地域上邻近苏联交通极为方便，历史上和现在中苏人民往来的机会较他区要多，故向苏联学习确有“得天独厚”之处。
    二、略谈向苏联学习应有的态度
    苏联是世界上第一个社会主义国家，它过去和现在都注意吸取着全人类在各方面优良的成果，它自己经过国内战争及第二次大战的考验，和前后四个五年计划的建设，在各方面的成就真是异常的伟大。现在全世界人民都公认它是人类的救星，和平民主坚强的堡垒；它是人类向前进步的火车头，要想进步只有跟着他走。也就是说要善于虚心地向苏联学习。我们要认识到学习苏联社会主义教育事业的经验，是建设中国新民主主义教育事业必要的条件之一；轻视学习苏联教育方面的经验是错误的。
    毛主席教育着我们：学习应该是实事求是、有的放矢，向苏联学习同样要抱着这种马列主义的科学态度。这就是说，向苏联学习时，我们要善于注意根据中国今天的环境和条件，来吸取他们适用于我们的宝贵的经验，以便更好的改进自己的工作。这就要善于区别：苏联在教育方面根本的方针和具体设施，在具体设施上又有成功的经验（它是主要的方面）和失败的教训（它是次要的方面），在成功的经验中，又要区别在目前中国有条件实行的和将来才能办得到的。假若我们囫囵吞枣不加区别的学习，不管具体条件而全盘搬用的话，那就会犯教条主义的毛病。
    根据笔者个人在学习中的体会，苏联明确地规定着教育要为政治即为无产阶级革命、社会主义建设、共产主义事业而服务，教育的具体设施要和社会的生产劳动与政治生活紧密结合，使教育能适应为劳动人民服务的方针。学校教育和社会教育的互相衔接，教育制度上的正规化，教学方法上注重学生对实物的感性知识的增进，以便帮助其领会理性知识。在考试上实行“五分制”，重视学前幼稚教育和家庭教育，并使其有机的配合着中小学教育，强调学生爱国主义的教育和新道德及纪律性的修养，启发学生在学习上的自觉性和指导其课外民主自治学习小组的活动，关心他们的身心发育健康和养成卫生习惯。中小学校教育要连贯统一，实行男女分校，在小学四年内教师跟班走。重视师资的培养，提高他们的生活待遇和社会地位；异常负责地来编审课本教材与大量供给丰富的课外读物；学校修建设备的科学化……，这些都是苏联在教育上成功的设施，是任何资本主义国家望尘莫及的。这都是值得我们今后长期间向其学习的。
    其中有些设施，我们今天因受着客观条件的限制，还不能就作到，例如学校的设备科学化，教师的待遇很高等等，要知道苏联今天的成就，绝不是一蹴即成的，而是三十来年建设的成果。将来的中国也一定会努力赶上的。另外，在学习苏联时，同时要注意到总结自己成功的经验，并使二者在建设新教育事业的过程中有机的结合起来；只注意他人而忽视自己成功的经验，也同样是错误的。
    最后，笔者希望各地中苏友好协会，能以有计划的组织和帮助教育界向苏联学习，以利中国新民主主义教育事业之发展。
    一九四九、八、一三
