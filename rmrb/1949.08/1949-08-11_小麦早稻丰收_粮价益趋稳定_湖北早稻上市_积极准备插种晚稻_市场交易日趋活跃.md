Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 10th: Autumn harvest has begun in various parts of Hubei Province, and early rice is already on the market. Except for individual areas in the Daye and Xiaogan Special Districts that suffered reduced harvests due to flooding, most areas have reported bumper harvests. In the Huanggang Special District, Huanggang, Xishui, and other counties also have an 80% harvest. Currently, various places are actively preparing to transplant late rice. After the new rice entered the market, grain prices in various places have fallen, and market transactions have become increasingly active. Trade companies in various places are preparing to purchase large quantities of new rice to regulate the market, connect urban and rural areas, and avoid low grain prices hurting farmers. The "Yunmeng Plain," a famous area for rice production, stretches from Huangpi and Yunmeng in southeastern Hubei, along the Yangtze River into northeastern Hunan. The land is fertile and produces two rice harvests per year. The current harvest is early rice, and late rice can be planted immediately after harvesting, to be harvested in the autumn. A large amount of rice produced in this area each year is transported to Wuhan, Xuchang, Zhengzhou, and other places for sale.

    湖北早稻上市
    积极准备插种晚稻
    市场交易日趋活跃
    【新华社汉口十日电】湖北省各地开始秋收，早稻已经上市。大冶、孝感两专区除个别地区因受水灾歉收外，大部地区均告丰收。黄冈专区黄冈、浠水等县亦有八成年景。现各地正积极准备插种晚稻。新米上市后，各地粮价均告下落，市场交易日趋活跃。各地贸易公司正准备大批收购新米，以调剂市场，沟通城乡关系，并避免谷贱伤农。按湖北省东南部自黄陂、云梦起，顺长江入湖南东北部，为著名之“云梦平原”，土地肥沃，盛产稻米，每年收获两次，目前收割者为早稻，收完后即可种晚稻，于秋后收割。该地区每年所产大米，有大批运往武汉、许昌、郑州等地销售。
