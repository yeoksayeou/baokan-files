Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 26th: Under the call of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Military Control Commission, the Shanghai industrial sector is actively transforming its production direction, facing the interior and the countryside, to overcome the difficulties of raw material sources and product sales.

　　Connecting with the interior and producing for the needs of industrial and mining construction in inland cities is one of the fundamental ways for the Shanghai industrial sector to escape the current difficult situation. All sectors have successively organized inspection groups to go to the interior for investigation, so as to purchase raw materials from the interior and carry out production according to the needs of the inland market. The "Shandong Industrial and Mining Enterprise Inspection Group," which went to Shandong in late June, returned to Shanghai in mid-month. The Machine, Electrical Engineering, and Foundry Industry Associations are also planning to organize inspection groups to go to Northeast and North China. The "Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Industry Production and Sales Joint Inspection Group" is also being organized. The woolen textile industry will also organize the "Northwest Wool Inspection Group" soon, and plans to establish sheep breeding improvement farms in suitable areas of Jiangsu, Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Shandong, as well as train excellent workers and send them to the interior to participate in sheep breeding improvement work. After the gradual restoration of transportation between Shanghai and North and Central China, northern soybeans, wood, sodium sulfide, coal, etc., have been able to supply Shanghai in large quantities, and Shanghai-produced sulfide blue, electrical equipment, and machine material parts have also gradually been sold to the north. The Shandong and a certain mine orders recently received by the Shanghai electrical machinery industry are enough for larger-scale electrical machinery factories to produce for three or four months. Yongxin Electrical Equipment Factory and others are planning to concentrate their efforts on manufacturing generators, transformers, and motors suitable for coal mines, to meet the needs of large-scale mining in various coal mines in East China.

　　Many factories are beginning to change their production direction according to the needs of the countryside. The water pumps manufactured by the Xinzhong Engineering Company in the past were mostly only suitable for urban use. Now the company has decided to manufacture water pumps for rural use to expand sales and help restore rural production. Xingya Steel Factory, equipped with a complete set of machine tools, has decided to switch to manufacturing agricultural implements and will soon begin manufacturing 100 tons of hoes, sickles, cutting tools, boat nails, and iron plates, etc., needed by rural areas in East China every month. Xingye Industrial Engineering Company and others also plan to increase the production of agricultural machinery. The steel and iron building materials produced by the iron and steel smelting industry were originally sold in Shanghai and other places, and now they are striving to expand sales to North China and the interior. Meiya Silk Weaving Factory and Dacheng Silk Factory, which originally produced export goods and fine goods, are also preparing to switch to producing popular goods. The shirt industry has stopped making fine shirts and switched to making ordinary goods.

　　Many manufacturers are planning and considering relocating factories to suit raw materials and markets, overcome dependence on imperialism, and change the phenomenon of industries being abnormally concentrated in Shanghai. The textile industry, one of Shanghai's largest light industries, which concentrates nearly one-third of the country's spindles, mainly relied on imported raw cotton, wool, etc., in the past. In order to change the unreasonable phenomenon of being separated from cotton-producing areas, the cotton textile industry is studying the distribution of factory numbers and spindle numbers according to region, raw materials, market, and power equipment conditions, and relocating production. Dazhong Colloid Chemical Refining Factory, which uses cattle hide by-products as its main raw material, has decided to relocate to Hankou for production, considering that Hankou produces more leather and has a central location. China Standard Pencil Factory has decided to move half of its machinery to Harbin and cooperate with Harbin Enterprise Company to establish a machine pencil factory. The first batch of 30 tons of machinery to be moved north has been packed and is awaiting shipment. Xinxin Hongji Match Factory has also begun preparing to move to Bengbu. Huanqiu Handkerchief Factory has completed preparations for moving to Tianjin. Many manufacturers are using methods such as modifying machines or using substitutes to solve the difficulties of the interruption of imported raw materials and export markets. Xinzhong Engineering Company, the only company in the country that manufactures gas engines, is now preparing to manufacture gas engines in large quantities to replace gasoline and diesel engines. This type of engine can be widely used in ships, vehicles, mines, and power plants. The woolen textile industry has begun to use waste wool, domestic wool, or cotton yarn mixed with imported wool to manufacture coarse serge and blankets. According to surveys, Shanghai currently has no less than 20,000 dan of Shandong and Huzhou wool, which can be used for spinning without technical difficulties. The paper industry's foreign market for export paper has been cut off, while the domestic market is in short supply due to the interruption of imported paper. It is currently planning to convert the machines that originally manufactured export paper into machines for manufacturing domestic paper, and to use bamboo, rice straw, reeds, soybean stalks, etc., as raw materials as much as possible to replace foreign pulp.

　　Many industries that were squeezed out and suffocated by foreign goods dumping in the past are now striving to develop to meet market needs. In view of the fact that no American or French cigarette paper is shipped to the North China market, Minfeng and Huafeng Paper Factories recently established cigarette paper sales organizations in Tianjin, and have received an order for 125 boxes from Shandong Tobacco Company. These two paper factories have also newly established or strengthened their original sales organizations in Nanjing, Hankou, Bengbu, and other places, and also plan to sell goods to Shaanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Mongolia. Jingang Hinge Machine Factory, which specializes in manufacturing Feilun brand hinges, believes that since foreign hinges (in the past, foreign imported hinges reached 20,000 boxes per year) cannot be imported, it is an opportunity to develop production and is actively raising funds, preparing to greatly increase the current monthly output of 100 boxes. The required steel plates and other raw materials can be purchased domestically. Dahua, Gongda, and other five or six leather factories have begun to manufacture square leather (semi-finished cattle hide) for making wheel belts. This type of square leather used to rely on imports, and self-sufficiency will be no problem in the future. In order to replace imported fuels such as gasoline and diesel, the alcohol industry is actively recovering and developing. Donghai Chemical Factory is planning to greatly increase the production of nitrocellulose, one of the important chemical raw materials, to fill the foreign goods market that has been cut off. Vacuum tubes, important radio equipment that used to rely on imports, have been successfully trial-produced by Xinhua Radio Corporation, and the price is only half that of American products.

　　In order to overcome blindness and give play to collective strength, various industrial departments are actively uniting with each other to jointly solve difficulties such as raw materials and sales channels. The cotton textile industry has decided to send people from Shenxin, Yong'an, and other factories to Yichang, Shashi, and other places to investigate raw cotton conditions and prepare to jointly purchase. The Cement Industry Federation is planning to collectively order domestic gypsum and has now sent a special person to Yingcheng Gypsum Mine to negotiate. The industry has decided to organize a production and sales cooperation committee, preparing to divide labor and produce according to the favorable conditions of the same industry in various places. The cigarette industry is also preparing to organize a joint production and sales organization.

　　上海产业界积极转变生产
  　适应城乡需要
    过去被外货倾销排挤的行业已获发展机会
    【新华社上海二十六日电】上海产业界在中共市委会和军管会的号召下，正纷纷转变生产方针，面向内地，面向农村，以克服原料来源和成品销路的困难。
    沟通内地关系，并为内地各城市工矿建设的需要而生产，这是上海产业界脱出目前困难局面的根本办法之一。各界纷纷组织考察团赴内地考察，以便向内地采购原料和按内地市场需要来进行生产。“山东工矿事业考察团”自六月下旬赴山东后，已于本月中旬返回上海。机器、电工、翻砂等业公会亦正筹组考察团，赴东北和华北各地。“江浙绸业产销联合考察团”亦在筹组中。毛纺业最近亦将组织“西北羊毛考察团”，并计划在苏豫皖浙鲁之适宜地区设立羊种改良场，以及训练优秀工人，派赴内地参加改良羊种的工作。上海与华北华中的交通逐步恢复后，北方的大豆、木材、硫化碱、煤炭等已能大批供应上海，上海所产硫化青、电工器材和机器材料零件等亦已逐渐北销。上海电机业最近接到的山东和某矿的订货单，足够规模较大的电机工厂生产三、四个月。永新电工器材厂等正拟集中力量，制造适合煤矿使用的发电机、变压器和电动机等，以应华东各煤矿大规模开采的需要。
    许多工厂正开始按照农村的需要改变生产方向。新中工程公司过去所制抽水机大部仅适合都市使用。现该公司决定制造供农村使用的抽水机，以便推广销路，并帮助农村生产的恢复。备有全套工作母机的兴亚钢业厂已决定改制农具，即将开始制造供华东各地农村每月所需的一百吨锄头、镰刀、砍具、造木船用钉和铁板等。兴业实业工程公司等亦拟增产农业机械。钢铁炼制业所产钢铁建筑材料，原来行销于上海等地，现正力谋扩大向华北和内地行销。原制外销货和细货的美亚织绸厂和大诚制绸厂等亦准备改制大众化货品。衬衣业已停制细货衬衣改制大路货。
    许多厂家为了迁就原料和市场，以克服对帝国主义的依赖，和改变工业畸形集中于上海的现象，已在计划和考虑迁厂问题。集中了将近全国三分之一锭子的上海最大轻工业之一的纺织业，过去所用的原棉、羊毛等主要是依靠舶来。棉纺业为改变和产棉地脱离的不合理现象，正在研究将棉纺业按区域、原料、市场、动力设备等条件，分配厂数锭数，迁地生产。以制牛皮的副产物为主要原料的大中胶质化学制炼厂，鉴于汉口制皮较多，且地位适中，已决定迁移汉口生产。中国标准铅笔厂已决定将机器之半迁哈尔滨，与哈尔滨企业公司合作建立机器铅笔工厂，第一批北迁机器三十吨已分装待运。新新宏记火柴厂亦已着手筹备迁往蚌埠。寰球手帕厂已完成了迁往天津的准备工作。许多厂家正以改装机器或采用代用品等办法来解决舶来原料和外销市场断绝的困难。国内仅有的一家制造煤气发动机的新中工程公司，现又着手准备大批制造煤气发动机，以代替汽油和柴油引擎。这种发动机可以广泛应用于船舶、车辆和矿厂、电厂。毛纺业已开始利用废毛、国产羊毛或棉纱与舶来羊毛掺和，制造粗制服呢和毯子等。据调查，上海现存山东和湖州羊毛不下二万担，用以纺织，在技术上并无困难。造纸业以外销纸的国外市场断绝，而国内市场又以舶来纸断绝而供不应求，目前正计划把原来制造外销纸的机器改装为制内销纸的机器，并尽量采用竹、稻草、芦苇、大豆梗等作原料，以代替外来纸浆。
    许多过去为外货倾销所排挤和窒息的行业，现正力图发展，以应市场需要。民丰、华丰两造纸厂鉴于已无美、法卷烟纸输至华北市场，最近特在天津成立卷烟纸推销机构，并已得到山东烟草公司订货一百二十五箱。这两个造纸厂并在南京、汉口、蚌埠等地新设或加强原有的销售机构，还计划向陕、察、绥、蒙等地销货。专造飞轮牌铰链的金钢铰链机器厂鉴于外国铰链（过去外国进口的铰链每年达二万箱）不能进口，正是发展生产的机会正积极筹备资金，准备将日前每月一百箱的产量大大提高，所需钢板等原料都能在国内购到。大华、公大等五、六家皮革厂已开始制造供制轮带用的方皮（牛皮半成品），此种方皮向靠输入，将来自给当无问题。为了代替舶来的汽油、柴油等燃料，酒精业已在积极恢复发展中。东海化工厂正计划大大提高重要化工原料之一的硝化棉的产量，以填补业已断绝的外货市场。过去依靠进口的无线电重要器材真空管，已由新华无线电社试制成功，且售价仅及美货一半。
    为克服盲目性及发挥集体力量，各产业部门正纷纷互相联合，以统一解决原料和销路等困难。棉纺业已决定由申新、永安等厂派人赴宜昌、沙市等地调查原棉情况，准备联合收购。水泥工业联合会正在计划集体订购国产石膏，现已派专人赴应城石膏矿接洽。该业已决定组织产销合作委员会，准备根据各地同业的有利条件，分工生产。卷烟业亦正筹组产销联合机构。
