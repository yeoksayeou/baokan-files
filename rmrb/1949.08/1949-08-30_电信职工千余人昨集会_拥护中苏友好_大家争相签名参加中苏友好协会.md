　　Thousands of Telecommunications Workers Gathered Yesterday
    Supporting Sino-Soviet Friendship
  　Everyone Eagerly Signed Up to Join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    [Our Newspaper] The General Branch of the Communist Party of China in the Telecommunications Directorate and the Peiping Telecommunications Bureau convened a meeting yesterday to support Sino-Soviet friendship and launched a signature campaign to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. The meeting was held at 7:00 PM yesterday (August 29th) at the Telecommunications Directorate, with the enthusiastic participation of over a thousand employees. The meeting specially invited Comrade Liu Yin, Deputy Director of the Directorate, to convey Comrade Peng Zhen's report on Sino-Soviet relations given at Zhongshan Park on the 21st. Finally, the two bureaus' General Branches of the Communist Party proposed initiating a signature campaign to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and submitting the signed list to the Preparatory Committee of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, requesting to be considered group members. This immediately received enthusiastic support from the entire audience, and everyone eagerly signed up. Although many signature tables were set up, they were still overcrowded. Some people were anxious because they couldn't sign up. The chairman then proposed that those who couldn't sign up could return and continue signing up in their respective units tomorrow. The symposium ended at 9:00 PM. (Li)
