　　Special Agencies Established in the Inner Four Districts
  　Strictly Register Reactionaries
  　Those Who Persist in Evil Will Be Severely Punished
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Under the principle of not letting go of a single bad person and not wronging a single good person, the 32 registration offices for self-renewal and repentance of reactionary party and group personnel in Beiping Municipality have been carrying out registration in a planned and systematic manner, achieving great results. The work of the Inner Four, Northern Suburbs, Inner Three, and Suburban Eight sub-bureaus of the Public Security Bureau has been relatively good. When the Inner Four sub-bureau began its work, it conducted planned publicity and mobilization work. At the district level, various specialized review agencies were established, and the heads personally participated in the work, convening planned mass meetings of workers, factory directors, vendors, managers of various industries, puppet Baojia personnel, and all police officers from public and private factories, some with over a thousand participants. At various meetings, in-depth mobilization was carried out, and the masses were mobilized to expose reactionary party and group members who refused to register or concealed information. The Suburban Eight district convened a mass meeting of more than 2,000 people and publicly announced the special agents who had already registered, allowing the broad masses to supervise them and deeply calling on the masses to continue to expose reactionary party and group members. After the meeting, the masses directly urged the reactionary party and group members to go to the sub-bureau for registration. The village cadres of Houjia Village urged Zhang Yonghai and Diao Yongquan, the district committee members of the reactionary party and group, to go to the sub-bureau to complete registration. Some reactionary elements who had already fled had their addresses found after being reported by the masses. Under the lenient policy of the People's Government and the exposure of the masses, most reactionary party and group members have realized that registration and bowing their heads to the people is the only way out, but some individual reactionary elements are still obsessed and attempt to resist registration. The People's Government, under the principle of not letting go of a single bad person and not wronging a single good person, will certainly give those who honestly register a path to self-renewal and repentance, but those who resist or sabotage registration will certainly be given the punishment they deserve.

　　内四区专设机构
  　严密登记反动分子
  　怙恶不悛分子必予严惩
    【本报讯】在不放松一个坏人、不冤枉一个好人的原则下，北平市三十二个反动党团人员自新悔过登记处，有计划有步骤的办理登记，以获很大成绩。公安局方面以内四、北郊、内三、郊八等分局工作较好。内四分局在工作开始时，即有计划地进行了宣传动员工作，区一级并成立了各种专门性的审查机构，首长亲自动手进行工作，有计划地召开了公私营工厂工人、厂长、摊贩、各行业经理、伪保甲人员、全体员警等大会，有的会参加者达千余人之多。在各种大会上，进行了深入动员，发动群众检举拒不登记，或隐瞒不报之反动党团分子。郊八区曾召开了两千余人的群众大会，当众公布了已经登记过的特务分子，让广大群众对他们加以监督，并深入号召群众继续检举反动党团分子。会后群众直接督促反动党团委员去分局登记，侯家庄村干，督促反动党团区分委张永海、刁永泉等到分局履行登记，有些原已潜逃的反动分子经群众检举后已找到了他们的住址。在人民政府宽大政策与群众检举下，大部分反动党团分子已感到还是登记向人民低头有出路，但仍有个别反动分子执迷不悟，企图抗拒登记，人民政府则以不放松一个坏人、不冤枉一个好人的原则，对老实登记者必给以自新悔过之路，但对抗拒或破坏登记者必给以应得之惩办。  　　　　（光）
