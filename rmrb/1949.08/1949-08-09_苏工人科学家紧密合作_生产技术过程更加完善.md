Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 8th: Moscow dispatch: Workers, scientific, and technical personnel in Leningrad City and Oblast, a few months ago, wrote to Stalin guaranteeing close cooperation between scientists and industrial workers, striving for continued technological progress. The Stakhanovite movement and scientists are gloriously fulfilling their promise. At the Kirov Electric Power Plant, two corresponding members of the Academy of Sciences, twenty-six Doctors of Technical Sciences, fifty-six candidate members of the Academy of Sciences, and seventy-eight scientists participated in solving urgent technical problems. This cooperation has enabled the workers of the electric power plant to greatly improve several technical processes and perfect several complex machines. For example, accelerated metal cutting is a novel technique in Soviet industry, with a cutting speed record of 1,000 meters per minute. But now the metal cutting speed in many factories—1,000 meters per minute—is very common. The electric power plant has reached a speed of 1,500 meters per minute when cutting certain metal items. This achievement is the result of close cooperation between scientists and workers. At the Kirov factory, scientists helped workers improve tractor designs and create new types of gas generators for tractors, etc. When outstanding workers in Leningrad achieve significant successes, engineers, technicians, and scientists immediately study them. The estimations made and methods created by advanced workers are examined and summarized by renowned scientists. Therefore, not only individuals but also collectives can quickly adopt new working methods and achieve high standards.

    苏工人科学家紧密合作
    生产技术过程更加完善
    【新华社北平八日电】莫斯科讯：列宁格勒市与州的工人、科学和技术工作者，几个月以前曾写信给斯大林保证科学家和产业工人紧密合作，争取技术上的继续进步。斯塔哈诺夫运动和科学家们正光荣地履行他们的诺言。在基洛夫电力工厂，两个科学院通讯会员、二十六个技术科学博士、五十六个科学院候补会员和七十八个科学家，曾参加解决了急切的技术问题。这一合作，使电力工厂工人们能够大大地改进若干技术过程，并使若干复杂的机器达到完善的地步。例如：苏联工业中加速度切割金属切割法是一种新奇的技术，切割速度的纪录是每分钟一千公尺。但现在许多工厂金属切割的速度——每分钟一千公尺是十分平常的，电力工厂在切割某些金属物品时，已达到每分钟一千五百公尺的速度。这一成就正是科学家和工人紧密合作的结果。在基洛夫工厂，科学家帮助工人改进拖拉机的设计，并创造拖拉机用的新型煤气发电机等。列宁格勒优秀工人得到了重大成就，工程师、技师和科学家就立即加以研究。先进工人所作的估计和所创造的方法都由著名的科学家加以检查和总结。因此，不仅个人而且集体都能迅速地采用新的工作方法，并达到高度的标准。
