    The Trade Union Calls on Workers to Go to the Countryside
    [Shanghai News] After Shanghai's importers and exporters consulted with the East China Foreign Trade Administration and obtained the consent of the North China Industry and Commerce Bureau to allow merchants with business licenses to operate in North China and provide them with convenience, companies such as Run Kang Trading Company, Fenghua Boutique Manufacturing Factory, Meilun Import and Export Firm, Zhengxin Xing Xieji, and Fu's Trading Company requested the Foreign Trade Administration to allow them to operate import and export businesses in North China ports and planned to export groceries, springs, watch straps, straw hats, porcelain, peppermint oil, etc. In order to help and take care of the business of private importers and exporters, the Administration also obtained the consent of the Railway Department to give priority to the transportation of export materials from the place of origin to Shanghai. At the same time, in response to the government's call to strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, companies such as He'an, Damao, Renren, and Tongfu sent representatives to Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Zhejiang, and northern Jiangsu to investigate and purchase materials, so that the stagnant import and export trade could be promoted under the general goal of prospering the domestic economy. Tongfu Company recently sent personnel to North China, carrying more than 20 kinds of paint samples, and successively transported cigarette paper, tin foil, ink raw materials, etc. in exchange for wool, egg yolk, egg white, etc.
    The Import and Export Industry Trade Union also called on workers to go to the mainland. Wang Dechang said: "This enemy blockade of Haikou is a good opportunity for the industrial and commercial circles to develop to the vast mainland, a good opportunity for the import and export industry to change its trade direction, and a good opportunity for our import and export workers to directly serve the workers and peasants. Therefore, a broad road in front of our import and export workers today is to face the mainland and go to the countryside."
