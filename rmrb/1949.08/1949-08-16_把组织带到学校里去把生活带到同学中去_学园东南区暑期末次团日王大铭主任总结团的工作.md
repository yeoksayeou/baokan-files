　　Bring the Organization to the School, Bring Life to the Students
    Director Wang Daming Summarizes团's Work at the Last团 Day of the Summer in the Southeast District of the Academy
    [This City News] The团 members of the Youth Academy in the southeast district of this city happily spent their last团 Day before graduation at the auditorium of Peking University Third Hospital on the afternoon of the 14th at 4:30 PM. At the meeting, they reviewed and planned their work, and held a group dinner and a social gathering. On the afternoon of the same day, 310团 members and more than 290 students filled the auditorium of Peking University Third Hospital. Until the meeting was announced, the auditorium was filled with magnificent and joyful singing. After the meeting began, Director Wang Daming of the Academy spoke first. He pointed out that the work of the Youth League in various schools in the last semester was basically good, and the Youth团 members played a certain leading role in learning and work. He then reviewed the past work, pointing out that the Youth团 had not done enough in uniting students for learning in many schools. There were also some problems in the work methods: many schools did not trust the students and failed to give most of the active students the opportunity to work; some schools even replaced the student union with the团 branch; at the same time, because some individual团 members did not realize that all work was for "learning", they thought that joining the团 must involve a special kind of work, thus creating a conflict between work and learning. Many团 members still retained underground work styles and clique styles in their work, and did not make their work public to the students. In organizational life, they did not actively welcome students to participate and offer opinions.
    In response to each deviation, he told everyone that in the future, they should focus their work on the education, life, and learning of the团. In terms of working methods, they should try to combine with the interests of the majority of students. Whether it is organizational life or any work, they should unite the masses, strive to overcome the contradiction between learning and work, and correct the shortcomings of individual团 members.
    Finally, he hoped that everyone would bring their organization into their own schools! Bring their lives to their fellow students!
    During the free discussion, the students successively expressed their opinions. Shi Baolian, a student from the Second Middle School, said that his past work had always been carried out in secret. He did not approach the masses, and everyone ignored him. Since participating in the Academy during the summer vacation, he had discussed and played games with everyone in the group, which was very harmonious. Therefore, he felt that as a团 member, he must live with everyone.
    Finally, the团 members and students unanimously shouted "团 members and students are one family!" "团 members and students unite!"
    Amidst everyone's laughter, they left the auditorium. More than 600 people were divided into 20 groups, sitting around on the lawn, eating their own dinners while engaging in lively and interesting games.
    At 7:30, the social gathering began. The solemn auditorium of a few hours ago was once again enveloped in a joyful and harmonious atmosphere. First, the "Land Reform" Yangko dance jointly performed by the male Second Middle School and the female Fourth Middle School was performed. Then, Huiwen, Muzhen, Xinsheng, and the Southeast District Academy Chorus performed various recreational programs. Finally, the drama troupe of the male Second Middle School and the female Fourth Middle School performed a drama.　　　(Xiao Yang)

　　把组织带到学校里去把生活带到同学中去
    学园东南区暑期末次团日王大铭主任总结团的工作
    【本市讯】本市东南区青年学园的青年团员于十四日下午四时半在北大三院礼堂欢渡结业前最末一次的团日。会上检讨与计划了工作，并举行了全体聚餐和联欢晚会。当天下午四点半，三百一十个团员和二百九十多个同学坐满了北大三院的礼堂。直到宣布开会以前，会场始终起伏着雄壮而愉快的歌声。开会以后，首由学园主任王大铭讲话。他指出上学期各校青年团的工作基本上是好的，青年团员在学习上与工作上都起了一定的带头作用。他继对过去的工作作了检讨，指出：青年团在团结同学学习上，很多学校做得还不够。在工作方法上也多少存在着一些问题：有许多学校不信任同学，没有能给大部分积极的同学以工作的机会，甚至有的学校用团支部代替了学生会；同时因为有的个别团员没有认识到一切工作都是为了“学习”，以为入团以后必需有一种特殊的工作，这样发生了工作和学习的矛盾。许多团员在工作上仍然保有地下作风，和小圈子作风，没有把工作向同学公开。在组织生活上，也没有主动地欢迎同学参加和提意见。
    针对每一个偏向，他告诉大家今后要把工作放在团的教育、生活和学习上。在工作方式上要尽量和广大同学的利益结合在一起，无论是组织生活和任何工作，都要团结广大群众，努力克服学习和工作的矛盾，纠正个别团员的缺点。
    最后他希望大家把自己的组织带到自己的学校里面去！把自己的生活带到自己的同学中间去！
    自由谈话时，同学们相继发表意见。二中史宝连同学说他过去的工作一直是在秘密之中展开的，自己不接近群众，弄得大家也不理他。自从暑假参加了学园，在小组中和大家讨论，游戏，这样搞得非常融洽。所以感到作一个团员必须要和大家生活在一起。
    最后团员和同学们一致高呼“团员同学是一家！”“团员同学团结起来！”
    在大家欢笑声中，离开了礼堂。六百多人分成二十个小组，围坐在草场上，一边吃着自己带来的晚餐，一边进行生动有趣的游戏。
    七点半钟，联欢会开始了。几小时以前庄严肃穆的礼堂，又重为愉快和谐的气氛所笼罩。首先是男二中女四中联合表演的秧歌舞“土地改革”，依次有：汇文、慕贞、新生、东南区学园大合唱团等表演各种游艺节目。最后由男二中女四中剧团演出话剧。  　　　（萧阳）
