    The Story of a Hero
    Second Cultural Troupe of the Third Field Army  He Peng
    During the battle of Jinan, our troops fought the enemy to a complete rout in a flour mill in the city. A portion of the enemy retreated into a large, open three-room structure, each hiding in the corners of the walls. At this time, a squad from the First Company of our Tenth Army had already charged in. Everyone knew there were enemies inside, understanding that they were trapped, so they were unwilling to throw grenades in and wanted to capture prisoners, but they wouldn't come out. Just as they were in a difficult situation, Vice Squad Leader Yang Hejing said to the Vice Instructor beside him: "Vice Instructor, I'll go in. If you hear gunfire inside, you should throw grenades and eliminate them! I'll give you my Thompson submachine gun!" The Vice Instructor asked, "How can you do without a gun?" "It's okay!" As he walked, he took out his flashlight and walked in with it on. The comrades outside waited anxiously for him. As soon as he entered, he shone the flashlight on his right hand and said: "Brothers, don't shoot! I'm here to lead you out. Most of your army has been wiped out, what are you waiting for inside for? Let me tell you, if we wanted to kill you, we would have thrown grenades long ago. Look, I don't have a gun in my hand. I guarantee your lives and property will be safe if you come out. Let's go!" The eighteen enemies, in a panic, obediently walked out and lined up. Afterwards, the Vice Squad Leader said with a smile: "If I had a gun, they would have thought I was going to shoot them! They feel relieved when they see I don't have a gun, and after a bit of persuasion, of course they come out!"

    英雄的故事
    三野文工二团  何朋
    打济南时，我们的队伍在城里的一个面粉厂里把敌人打得落花流水，有一部分敌人退到一个三间通畅的大屋子里，一个个躲在墙角下。这时，我某十军一连的一个班已冲到这里，大家了解这里有敌人，知道他已成“瓮中之鳖”了，就不愿用榴弹扔进去，而想捉俘虏，但减他们又不出来。正在为难之时，副班长杨和景就对身旁的副指导员说：“副指导员，我进去，你如果一听到里面枪响，你就打榴弹，消灭他！我这根汤姆枪给你吧！”副指导员问：“你不要枪怎么行呢？”“没关系！”他一边走，一边就掏出身上的手电筒打着走进去，外面的同志很担心地等着他，他一进门就用电筒照着自己的右手说：“弟兄们不要打枪，我是来带你们出去的，你们的军队大部分都被歼灭了，你们还等在里面干什么？告诉你，我们要打死你们早就扔榴弹了，你们看我手里没有枪，出去我保证你们性命财产的安全，走吧！”慌做一团的十八个敌人，于是就乖乖的走出门站队了，事后副班长笑着说：“我要是带枪，他只当是打他的呢！我这样不带枪他看了也就放心，再一说服，当然出来啦！”
