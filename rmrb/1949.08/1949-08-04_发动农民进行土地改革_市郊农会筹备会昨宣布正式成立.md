At the meeting, Chai Zemin, secretary of the Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Zhou Fengming, director of the Suburban Work Committee of the Municipal People's Government, spoke successively, pointing out that: in order to solve their own problems, farmers must establish their own organizations in order to implement the "Decision on Agricultural Land Issues in the Municipal Area" issued by the Beijing Military Control Commission, carry out land reform, eliminate the long-term exploitation and oppression of feudal forces, and develop agricultural production. Yang Yunyu of the Beijing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation pointed out: the Farmers' Association must mobilize the broad masses of women to participate in the Farmers' Association, carry out land reform, participate in rural production, and strive for women's liberation in labor production. Farmer representatives from various districts also spoke one after another, denouncing the various crimes of the feudal forces and the Kuomintang reactionaries in colluding to oppress and exploit the farmers.

    【本市讯】中共北平市委郊区工作委员会、北平市人民政府郊区工作委员会，于昨（三）日召集市郊九个区区农会筹备会主任及农民代表共四十余人开会，正式成立北平市郊农会筹备会。推出柴泽民、刘岗、周凤鸣、苏民、杨蕴玉、赵焕平、刘德全、牛小庆、李怀等二十三人为北平市郊农会筹备会委员，并互推柴泽民、刘岗为筹备会正副主任，进行各项筹备工作。会上，中共北平市委郊委会书记柴泽民、市人民政府郊委会主任周凤鸣先后讲话，指出：农民为了解决自己本身的问题，必须成立自己的组织，才能执行北平市军管会发布的“关于本市辖区农业土地问题的决定”，进行土地改革工作，解除封建势力长期的剥削压迫，以发展农业生产。北平市民主妇联杨蕴玉指出：农会要发动广大妇女群众参加农会，进行土地改革工作，参加农村生产，在劳动生产中争取妇女解放。各区农民代表亦纷纷讲话，痛诉封建势力和国民党反动派结合压迫剥削农民的各种罪行。        
    按：平市四郊九个郊区内，共有一千五百六十九个自然村，六十六万余人，其中农民即达五十万人以上。北平解放后，各村已组成了村农会或村农会筹委会。各区农会筹委会也在七月先后组成。参加农会组织的会员已达四万八千七百二十八人。
