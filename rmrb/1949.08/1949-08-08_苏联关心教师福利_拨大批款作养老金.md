    苏联关心教师福利
    拨大批款作养老金
    【新华社北平七日电】莫斯科讯：随着教育事业的飞跃发展，苏联教师的福利也正在不断上升。苏联初等和中等学校教师工会，今年已拨出两亿六千四百万卢布，作为服务十五年以上的教师的养老金。这些教师除薪水外，还得到服务奖金，服务奖金的数量很大，相当于他们薪水的百分之四十。养老金由社会保险费中支付。初等和中等学校教师工会今年支出的社会保险费用总计将为六亿六千三百万卢布。对于暂时失去工作能力的教师，也有大笔津贴。对教师的文化和社会的服务，也拨出大笔款项。今年已拨出三千多万卢布维持这个职工会所主办的疗养院和休养所，教师们可以免费进入疗养院和休养所，或者只付出三分之一的费用。同时，为了维持少年先锋营，该职工会也拨出了三千多万卢布。教师的儿女们可以在少先营里渡过暑假。职工会并拨出三百五十万卢布，建立新的俱乐部，并推进教师们的业余技艺活动。为了推进体育工作，同样的巨款也拨出了。
