　　Stop Bad People from Impersonating the Construction Bureau and Issuing Engineering Inspection Certificates
    [This City News] For the convenience of inspection personnel performing their duties, the Municipal Construction Bureau has issued engineering inspection certificates. During the Kuomintang's rule, the outer service personnel of the pseudo-Public Works Bureau often used their power to extort and disturb the people; the inspection personnel after liberation helped citizens solve technical problems in construction and cared about the safety of citizens' residence and work. In order to prevent lawbreakers from impersonating inspectors and causing trouble, the Construction Bureau has issued engineering inspection certificates to the inspection personnel. It also hopes that citizens will pay attention to identification and report individual bad people at any time. In order to facilitate citizens' understanding of construction matters, the bureau has set up an inquiry office to answer various inquiries. (Li Hongduo, Tao Zuyao, Tan Peilin)

　　杜绝坏人冒充查工建局发工程检查证
    【本市讯】本市建设局为了查工人员执行职务便利起见，特发给工程检查证。国民党统治时期，伪工务局的外勤人员，经常利用职权，勒索扰民；解放后的查工人员则帮助市民解决建筑上的技术问题，关心市民居住和工作的安全。此次建设局为了杜绝不法分子冒充查工，借端滋事，特发给查工人员工程检查证。并希望市民注意识别，对个别坏人随时检举。又为便利市民了解建筑事项，该局特设问事处，负责答复各项询问。（李鸿铎，陶祖尧，谭佩琳）
