Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station, August 21st: Since the Civil Affairs Bureau mobilized to evacuate refugees, a total of 48,835 refugees have been repatriated in 42 days from July 6th to August 16th. Among them, some were subsidized for their travel expenses, while 35,030 people paid their own way. Refugees who have returned to their hometowns have already sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal People's Government expressing their gratitude. Local governments have generally made preparations for receiving refugees to return to their hometowns and resume production, and many county and city governments have sent letters stating that the repatriated refugees have been properly resettled.
