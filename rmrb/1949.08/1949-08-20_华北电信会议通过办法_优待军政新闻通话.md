  　Prioritizes Military, Government, and News Calls
    [This Newspaper's Report] According to information from the Telecommunications General Bureau: The North China Telecommunications Conference (closed on the 8th of this month), in order to support the Liberation War and facilitate the progress of the New Democratic construction, passed measures to prioritize long-distance telephone calls used by military and government organs and news calls. Currently, the Telecommunications General Bureau has sent a telegram to all telecommunications bureaus within the Liberated Areas to follow these procedures. The measures are as follows:
    (1) Measures for Prioritizing Military and Government Calls:
    One, Reduced-price military and government long-distance calls are limited to those made by military and government organs above the level of Special Commissioner's Offices and military sub-districts and their heads or senior managers, on official business with the aforementioned military and government organs, or military and government heads, or senior managers, or heads and responsible personnel of their directly subordinate lower-level organs.
    Two, In all locations with urban telephone equipment, military and government organs should provide a letter requesting the initiation of military and government long-distance calls, specifying the urban telephone number for transmitting long-distance calls for registration purposes; the name of the caller should also be reported when making the call for recording. In places without urban telephones, valid identification can be presented at the local telecommunications bureau's business office or agency for registration before making a call.
    Three, Call charges will be collected at half the rate of the applicable long-distance telephone call type.
    (2) Measures for Prioritizing News Calls:
    One, Both the calling and receiving parties for news long-distance calls should be news newspapers, news agencies, or news reporters. The call types are limited to ordinary call-number or call-person and urgent call-number or call-person.
    Two, To initiate a news call, one must first complete long-distance telephone registration procedures at the local telecommunications bureau (news reporters should present the press telegram certificate they have received, or other credentials sufficient to prove their identity), and pay the pre-deposited long-distance call fee according to the local telecommunications bureau's regulations.
    Three, Call charges will be collected at 70% of the rate of the applicable long-distance telephone call type.
