　　How to Improve People's Nutrition
    Wu Xian, Zhou Qiyuan
    This manuscript is taken from "A Humble Opinion on Improving National Nutrition," which was written by the two of us. Therefore, the two of us should still be listed as authors. However, Mr. Wu Xian is not currently in Beiping, so his consent has not been obtained. I hereby declare this.
  　Qiyuan's Note
    The most important resource and driving force of a country is the people's health. If the people's bodies are not well-developed, it is equivalent to insufficient capital, which cannot exert the highest driving force, and all undertakings will not be able to achieve the greatest results. Like all other products, the body must have sufficient raw materials of high quality and appropriate combination to produce good results. To provide all the substances needed by the human body in sufficient and suitable quantities to the people of the whole country, so that they can grow, survive, and reproduce normally, and also have a happy mood and exert the highest driving force (mental and physical), this is the work of improving people's nutrition.
    The weak physical constitution of our people is due to many reasons, but malnutrition is a major cause, which cannot be denied.
    When talking about nutrition, of course, we have to talk about diet. Although diet is most closely related to nutrition, the entire issue of people's nutrition is not just about diet. Before and after diet, there are many other related events.
    The nutritional value of plant-based foods is most closely related to the genetics of the seeds. Through selection and breeding, the nutritional content can be increased. The amount of nutritional content often varies depending on the soil, fertilizer composition, and climate. As for the abundance of yield, it is naturally obviously related to seeds, soil, fertilizer, and climate.
    The nutritional value of animal-based foods also varies depending on the feed. Researching animal nutrition and improving livestock feed and environment can certainly improve the nutritional efficacy of animal-based foods.
    Aquatic products, although mostly do not require artificial breeding, artificial insemination can increase production; protecting fishing and hunting are also specialized techniques.
    All research and improvement of facilities in agriculture, animal husbandry, and aquaculture are included in the business of the agricultural and forestry departments.
    Although the nutrient content in food can be increased, raw or rough food is often inedible. Although the yield of food may be very high, it cannot all be eaten at once. For storage to prepare for disasters, for the convenience of transportation, or for palatability, many foods must be properly processed or prepared, such as the hulling of grains, and the drying, refrigeration, pickling, and canning of fruits, vegetables, and meats, all of which must aim to preserve the original nutritional value as much as possible. Whether our old methods are appropriate and how to promote the application of new methods are all tasks within the scope of the food industry.
    The production areas of some foods are not spread throughout the country. The production and consumption areas are often far apart. A certain food may be overproduced in one place and in short supply in another. To make the production, supply, and consumption well-regulated, there must be good transportation facilities and transportation systems. The opening and coordination of land, sea, and air transportation lines, the refrigeration equipment of transportation tools, and the deadlines for transportation all need to be researched, planned, and implemented. These things all fall within the scope of transportation operations.
    Suppose that the yield of food is already very abundant, the nutritional value is already very high, the preparation methods are already very refined, and the transportation system is already very perfect, but the people's lives are poor and they are unable to purchase it. Even if there is very good food, if the people cannot enjoy it, it will still not help. To strengthen the people's purchasing power, we must first enable the people to engage in productive work. With increased production, the people can have income, and the standard of living can be improved, so that food can be rationally distributed. This requires the development of various industries, full employment of the people, and adjustment of labor treatment. All these things are urgent tasks within the scope of social economy.
    When the people are fully employed, engaged in production, and have increased income, and have the ability to purchase sufficient food, they may not know very clearly about the selection and combination of food and the cooking methods. To make everyone understand the theory of nutrition is certainly impossible, but to raise the people's knowledge level, so that most people have nutritional common sense and are familiar with the selection of food and appropriate cooking methods, is not considered a difficult task. This depends on the universality of publicity and the promotion of nutrition education.
    Even if the food selection and matching are appropriate and the cooking is very effective, the person eating it may still be malnourished, because what is eaten may not be fully utilized. For example, unhealthy teeth can hinder chewing, and an unhappy mood can hinder the secretion of digestive juices, both of which can lead to indigestion. Also, diarrhea and parasites can hinder the absorption of food, and metabolic disorders, such as diabetes, can render the absorbed nutrients useless. Therefore, for good nutrition, the body physiology must be normal and healthy, and the environment must be suitable. This sometimes requires the development of hygiene and medicine to correct or maintain.
    The above are just generalities, and there are more than just these associated matters. In short, the entire issue of people's nutrition involves a wide range of issues. From food production to metabolism, the process can be divided into two major stages: one stage is before the food enters the mouth, and the other stage is after the food enters the mouth. Before entering the mouth, there are: food production, preparation, storage, transportation, distribution, purchase, cooking, and education and hygiene. After the food enters the mouth, there are: digestion, absorption, circulation, storage, utilization, and excretion. To improve the entire people's nutrition, all the steps of all work before and after the food enters the mouth must be closely linked and proceed smoothly in order to achieve satisfactory results. In the past hundred years, our people have suffered from the oppression of feudal warlords and the exploitation of imperialism, and production has been backward, resulting in malnutrition. Insufficient food production and the conservatism of living habits are also among the reasons. In the people's diet, the proportion of grains is too large, while the proportion of vegetables, fruits, and animal foods is too small. Therefore, to improve the quality of the people's diet, we must first promote food production plans, and the increase in animal foods must be emphasized.
    Comparing the calories of food, one portion of animal food requires about five to seven portions of plant food as raw materials for production. Therefore, to increase animal foods, we must reclaim new land, increase the yield per unit of cultivated land, and use the grasslands of the Northwest to engage in animal husbandry. The cultivation of vegetables and fruits requires more labor. After industry develops, some farmers will need to switch to industry, and agricultural production will rely on machinery. All of these are necessary steps in the process of improving people's nutrition. This is only a part of the work in agriculture. As for the past inconvenience of transportation in our country, some food preparation and storage methods are not appropriate, the people's lives are difficult, the purchasing power is low, dietary habits and cooking methods are conservative, and various customs such as vegetarianism and contentment with poverty, have always been considered virtues for self-cultivation, all of which can hinder nutritional improvement. Therefore, to improve people's nutrition, not only must the agricultural situation be adjusted, but also some other economic and social problems must be solved at the same time.
    Now the People's Liberation War has basically achieved victory, and the People's Government is streamlining and saving, accumulating wealth, vigorously developing industry and agriculture, and expanding production. The people's nutrition problem can be gradually improved. In terms of technology, we should urgently cooperate with reality, concentrate limited talents and resources, and comprehensively and actively promote research and promotion related to the people's nutrition.
    In the administrative aspect of the People's Government, there should be an organization that can include various relevant agencies, such as the agricultural and forestry, economic, transportation, social, education, and health administrative departments, and various research and investigation institutions, and representatives of major food industries, to discuss and decide on the general policy of people's nutrition, and to review or implement various plans related to improving people's nutrition.
    In terms of technology, there should be an institution (or a combination of several institutions) to conduct research and design work in a planned way. Its scope of work should include:
    1. Plant Nutrition: Study the relationship between the composition of plant foods and factors such as soil, climate, and heredity, to prepare information for food production plans for grains, vegetables, and fruits.
    2. Animal Nutrition: Study the relationship between the growth, development, body composition of domestic animals and factors such as feed, environment, and heredity, to prepare information for livestock production plans.
    3. Food Economy: Conduct surveys on the dietary and food production and sales situations in various regions and urban and rural areas of the country, and among people of all classes, according to their groups, occupations, environments, and economic conditions, study their trends, and compile standard recipes.
    4. Food Chemistry: Engage in food analysis, analyze all kinds of natural foods and prepared foods, measure their nutrient content, and compile food composition tables at any time for the application of dietary management and research personnel. Testing food and vitamin products can also be considered as part of this work.
    5. Food Processing: Study food manufacturing, storage, preservation, cooking, and other processing methods, create new types of food, and invent new cooking methods.
    6. Physiological Chemistry: Study all the chemical changes that various components of food undergo in the body, from digestion to excretion, in order to have a thorough understanding of the human body's nutritional needs.
    7. Human Physiology: Study the physiological changes and nutritional relationships in the human body from infant and child development to adulthood and aging.
    8. Organic Chemistry: Study the extraction and artificial synthesis of certain organic components in food.
    9. Nutritional Deficiency Diseases: Investigate the nutritional status of the human body, study the diagnosis and pathology of nutritional deficiency diseases, and improve food supply and correction methods.
    10. Nutrition Promotion: Compile nutrition education materials, such as booklets, movies, broadcasts, exhibitions, models, and charts; assist various localities and groups in planning nutrition improvement experiments and research; publish publications, and liaise with various public and private institutions for nutrition improvement work.
    The above is a general outline of the research and promotion work on improving people's nutrition. As for nutrition education and talent training, etc., they are not within the scope of this article.
    To solve the nutritional problem of our people, it can be said simply that we can start from two different paths: one path is "physiological chemistry." This means that we should find all kinds of ways to seek the highest efficacy of the existing food in the current environment. The other path is "social economy." This means improving the social and economic system to produce the food that the people need to increase their nutrition, and enabling all the people in the country to have equal opportunities to fully enjoy it. These two paths are complementary and progressive. Each path has its own difficulties and ease. The current situation tells us that the "social economy" path has now begun to move forward smoothly; as for how to follow the "biochemistry" path, so that the two can go hand in hand, that is the specific task of our science and technology medical agriculture workers.

### 如何改进人民营养

　　如何改进人民营养
    吴宪　周启源
    本稿取材于“改进国民营养刍议”，该文为笔者两人所写，故本稿仍应由笔者两人列名，惟吴宪先生现时不在北平，未能征其同意，特此声明。
  　启源附识
    一个国家的资源和动力，最首要的，莫过于人民的身体，人民的身体长不好就是资本不充足，不能发挥最高的动力，一切的事业也就因之不能得到最大的成果。身体和其他一切生产品一样，要有好的出品，必定先要有充足的原料，原料品质必须要高，而且配合的也必须适当。拿充分与适合人体所需要的一切物质，供给全国人民，使能正常生长、生存和生育，而又能有快愉的心情，发挥最高的动力（脑力和体力），这便是改进人民的营养的工作。
    我国人民体质素弱，原因固然很多，营养不良是一个主要原因，这是不能否认的。
    谈到营养，当然要谈饮食，饮食虽然和营养最为关切，但是整个人民营养问题，则又不只饮食而已，饮食的前后，还有许许多多关联的事件。
    植物性食物营养价值的高低，与种籽的遗传最有关系，借选种和配种，可以把营养成分提高，营养成分的多少，又常因土壤、肥料的成分以及气候的不同而有分别，至于产量丰弱，自然更与种籽、土壤、肥料、气候有显然的关系。
    动物性食物的营养价值的高低，也因着饲料不同而有分别，研究动物营养，改良牲畜的饲料和环境，当然可以提高动物性食物的营养效用。
    水产，虽然大都不需要人工饲养，而人工使卵受精，可以使产量增加；保护渔猎等事也都是专门的技术。
    凡农业、牧畜、水产种种方面的研究与设施的改良都包括在农林部门事业之内。
    食物里营养素的含量虽然可以设法提高，但生的或是粗糙的往往不能入口。食物的产量虽然很多，而不能一旦都把它吃光，为了储藏防备灾荒，为了运输上的便利，或是为了适口，很多的食物必须经适当的方法加以处理或制备，如谷类的去皮，水果蔬菜肉类的干藏、冷藏、腌制、罐藏等都必须以尽量保存原有的营养价值为目的。我国旧有的方法是否适当，新法如何推广应用种种的事，都是属于食品工业范围之内的工作。
    若干食物的出产地，不是遍及全国。生产与消耗的地区往往相距很远。某种食物在甲地生产过剩，在乙地也许供不应求。要使生产供应消耗得有调济，必须有良好的交通机构和运输制度。如水陆空交通线的开辟和联运的配合，运输工具的冷藏设备，以及运交期限种种的事，都需要研究规划和推行，这些事都是属于交通业务范围之内的。
    假如说：食物的产量已经很丰富，营养价值已经很高，制备的方法已经很精，运输的制度也已很完善，但是人民生活穷困，购买无力，虽有很好的食物，而人民不能享用，依然无补于事。要使人民的购买力加强，必须先使人民从事生产工作。生产增加，人民才能有收入，生活水准乃能提高，食物的分配才能合理。这就需要各种工业的发展，人民充分就业，劳工待遇调整。凡这种种的事，都是社会经济范围以内的当前急务。
    人民充分就业，从事生产，收入增多，有能力购买充足食物的时候，对于食物的选择与配合以及烹调的方法又未见得能知道的很清楚。要使人人懂得营养的理论固然不可能，但是要提高人民知识水准，使多数人有营养常识，熟习选择食物和适当的烹调方法，也不算是一件难事。这就有赖宣传的普遍及营养教育的推广了。
    食物的选配虽然已经合适，烹调也很得法，吃的人，仍有营养不良的可能，因为所吃下去的东西未见得能充分利用。例如牙齿不健全可以妨碍咀嚼，心情不愉快，可以妨碍消化液的分泌，这都能使消化不良。又如泻肚，寄生虫可以妨碍食物的吸收，新陈代谢失常，如糖尿病，又可以使已被吸收的营养素归于无用。所以要营养情形良好，身体生理还要正常健康，环境还要适宜，这有时要靠卫生医药的发展，才能改正或是维持。
    以上说的几项，仅是大体，所有关联的事又何止于此。总而言之，整个人民营养问题，牵涉很广。从食物生产起以至新陈代谢止，其间所经过的程序，可以分两大阶段：一段在食物入口以前，一段在食物入口以后，入口以前的有：食物生产，制备，储藏，运输，分配，选购，烹调及教育卫生等事。食物入口以后的有：消化，吸收，循环，储备，利用以至排泄等事，要改进整个人民营养，凡食物入口以前及以后，使所有一切工作的步骤，必须有周密的连系，顺利的进行，才可以得到圆满的结果。我国人民近百年来因受封建军阀的压迫，帝国主义的剥削，生产落后，以致营养不良，及食物生产不够，生活习惯的守旧也是原因之一。人民膳食里，谷类所占成分太多，而蔬菜水果及动物性食品的成分太少。所以，要提高人民膳食的品质，首先要推行食物增产计划，动物性食品的增产，更须着重。
    以食物的发热量比较，一份动物性食品，约需五至七份的植物性食品以为生产原料。因此，要增加动物性食品，必须开垦新地，增加每单位耕地的产量，并利用西北草地，从事牧畜。蔬菜水果的培养，需要较多人工，俟后工业发达，一部分农民更需改就工业，则农业增产必赖机器。凡此，都是改进人民营养过程中必经的步骤。这仅仅是农业方面的一部分工作。至于过去我国运输不便，食物制备与储藏方法有些尚不得宜，人民生活窘迫，购买力低，饮食习惯烹调方法守旧，以及茹素安贫种种习俗等，一向被认为是修身美德的一些事，在在可为营养改进的妨碍。所以，改进人民营养，不但农业情形须经一番调整，其他若干经济社会问题也须要同时设法解决。
    现在人民解放战争基本上已获得胜利，人民政府正在精简节约，积累财富，大力发展工农业，扩大生产，人民的营养问题可以逐渐改善，技术方面急应配合现实，集中有限的人才与物力，统筹并积极推行有关人民营养的研究和促进事宜。
    在人民政府行政方面应该有一个组织可以包括各有关机构，如农林、经济、交通、社会、教育、卫生各行政部门及各研究调查机关，各大食品工业之代表，商讨并决定人民营养的大政方针，审核或执行有关改进人民营养各种计划。
    在技术方面应该有一个机构（或是几个机构的联合），有计划的进行研究与设计工作，它的工作范围应该包括：
    一、植物营养　研究植物性食物的成分与土壤气候遗传等因素的关系。以准备粮食蔬菜水果等食物生产计划的资料。
    二、动物营养　研究家畜动物的生长生育身体成分与饲料环境遗传等因素的关系，以准备牲畜生产计划的资料。
    三、食物经济　就全国各地及城市乡村，各阶层民众，依其团体职业环境经济状况等，调查膳食及食物生产供销的情形，研究其趋势，编制标准食谱。
    四、食物化学　从事食物分析工作，凡各种天然食物及制备后的食物，均加以分析，测定其营养素成分，随时编制食物成分表，以供膳食管理及研究人员应用。检定食物及维生素成品，亦可算为这方面的工作。
    五、食物加工　研究食物制造储藏、防腐、烹调等加工方法，制出新样食品，发明新烹调方法。
    六、生理化学　研究食物各项成分在身体之内，自消化以至排泄，所经过的一切化学变化，以期对于人体营养的需要有彻底的了解。
    七、人体生理学　研究人体自婴儿幼童发育，成年以至衰老各时期之生理变化与营养的关系。
    八、有机化学　研究食物中若干有机成分的提炼，与人工综合的方法。
    九、营养缺乏病　调查人体营养情况，研究营养缺乏病的诊断病理，改进食品供给及纠正的方法。
    十、营养促进　编制营养教育器材，如小册子、电影、广播、展览、模型、图表；协助各地各团体计划营养改进实验与研究；发行刊物，以及联络各公私机构营养改进的工作。
    以上所举，是关于改进人民营养的研究和促进工作的大概。至于营养教育与人才训练等事不在本文讨论范围之内。
    按解决我国人民营养问题，简单说可从两条不同的路子着手：一条路是“生理化学”的。这是说：就目前环境里现有的食物，想种种方法来求它最高的效用。再一条路是“社会经济”的。这是说：改善社会经济制度，以生产人民所需要增进他们营养的食物，并能使全国所有的人民都能有同等的机会充分享用。这两条路，是相辅并进的。两条路各有其难易。目前的形势使我们知道“社会经济”的一条路现在已经开始顺利的前进；至于怎样按着“生物化学”路走，使两个并驾齐驱，那便是我们理工医农科学工作者的具体任务了。
