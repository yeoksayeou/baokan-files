　　I. Aggression Against China by Following or Through Other Countries (Continued II)

    When Pirie traveled in the Far East, he believed that the United States needed to maintain a naval base in the Orient, and suggested to the government that the first step should be to occupy the Bonin Islands, the Ryukyu Islands, and Taiwan. An American, Mr. Peter Parker, came to China in 1855 as a representative, intending to implement this plan. It happened that in 1857, two American businessmen were engaged in the camphor industry in Taiwan and had disputes with the local Taiwanese authorities. Commodore Armstrong, commander of the U.S. Navy fleet in Hong Kong, supported them and raised the American flag in Taiwan, preparing to establish an "independent country." However, the U.S. naval power in China was still weak at that time, and it was inconvenient to act rashly, so it had to declare that "the development of commerce belongs to the scope of private enterprise" and temporarily abandoned the plan! In 1873 (the twelfth year of Tongzhi), the former U.S. Consul in Fujian, Li Send (also known as Li Rangli), actually led American troops to attack Taiwan. The Taiwanese people resolutely resisted, and the United States failed again. Li Hongzhang, the Qing government official in charge of this negotiation, wrote to his friend that "(Taiwan's) indigenous people are in a dangerous terrain, and the Americans have repeatedly failed to attack. Although Li Send has been there, what can he do?" But the United States' ambition to occupy Taiwan did not diminish because of this. The following year, Li Send went to Japan and, on the grounds that Taiwanese aborigines had killed Ryukyu refugees in 1871 and that Ryukyu had sent people to Japan to complain, he incited Japan to attack Taiwan, claiming it was necessary to "punish" Taiwan. In 1874 (the thirteenth year of Tongzhi), the United States and Japan jointly sent troops to Taiwan on a large scale. In April, the Chinese side received news from Shanghai: "Japan has dispatched Prince Arisugawa to oversee the matter, with Li Send as an advisor... Foreign newspapers report 15,000 people, but the actual number of soldiers is unknown. The American company ship 'New York' is loading 3,000 people, said to be Japanese mercenaries going there..." In addition to participating with land forces, the United States also added warships, led by U.S. naval officers. At this time, the Qing government was very clear that Japan's actions were being driven by the United States, and that Japan and the United States had become a party, and wanted to use diplomatic means to contain them. In May 1874, Li Hongzhang's memorial to the "Zongli Yamen" stated: "Currently, Japanese ships and troop leaders mostly use American military officers. It is appropriate to first dissolve their party, otherwise, British and French people can also be temporarily employed in Chinese warships to counteract them." In September of the same year, he wrote to the "Zongli Yamen": "Feng Dao said that Britain and the United States are actually secretly helping Japan, hoping to share the benefits in the future, but Germany is very jealous of it and not in their party. If this is discussed, it seems appropriate to draw Germany to secretly restrain the other countries..." When the military situation became tense, the Qing government ordered Pan _, the Fujian Treasurer, to go to Taiwan to assist in defense. Pan _ met with Japan's representative to China, Yanagihara Sakimitsu, in Shanghai. After repeated persuasion, Yanagihara admitted that Japan's dispatch of troops was being used by the United States and expressed regret. When Fuzhou General Wen Yu and others reported "the situation of the Japanese army disturbing Taiwan," they said: "The chieftain initially denied it in every possible way, but then suddenly admitted regret, being sold by Westerners, and agreed to withdraw troops, with handwritten evidence to be found..." Later, when a major plague broke out among the Japanese army in Taiwan, and the Qing government also had the idea of sending Fujian Governor Wang Kaitai to assist Taiwan with 20,000 soldiers, Japan was greatly discouraged and sent Okubo Toshimichi to China to negotiate peace. Seeing that the situation was not good, the U.S. Deputy Consul in China, Pettigrew, and Consul General Ainsworth hurriedly came forward to engage in so-called "mediation." In August 1874 (July 24th of the Qing calendar), Pettigrew told the Qing government that he "could mediate" the Taiwan matter! In October of the same year, Ainsworth rushed from the United States to Japan to meet with Li Hongzhang, saying that the Japanese government did not want to break with China over the aboriginal incident, but hoped for a compromise settlement, and said that "Article 1 of the Sino-American treaty states that if other countries have any unfair or disrespectful matters, assistance must be given to mediate. The American treaty with Japan also contains this language, so mediation is within my duty..." Later, with the addition of British Minister Wade's activities, the Qing government had no determination to resist and was happy to have someone mediate, so it opened Taiwan as a commercial port and paid an indemnity of 500,000 taels. The United States used Japan to achieve its goals of gaining a foothold in Taiwan and opening up markets.

    In 1876, the United States participated in the so-called "mediation" of the "Margary Affair," obtaining the right to trade at ports such as Yichang and Wuhu through Britain.

    Soon after, the United States again shielded Japan's occupation of Ryukyu. Ryukyu had been a tributary state of China since the 14th century (after Hongwu of the Ming Dynasty). From 1872, Japan gradually annexed it, and in 1879 (the fifth year of Guangxu), it implemented the change of Ryukyu to Okinawa Prefecture. The Qing government was not active in this matter, saying that it did not want to "pursue empty fame and diligently pursue distant strategies." The Ryukyu king sent people secretly to China several times to seek help, with extremely miserable and urgent pleas. The Qing government then realized that the nature of the matter was serious and had to argue. When former U.S. President Grant came to China for a visit and was about to go to Japan, Li Hongzhang, the Governor-General of Zhili, wanted to ask Grant to mediate. Li himself knew that "Japan actually regards the United States as a protector," but he insisted on thinking that Grant was a fair person "trusted by all," fantasizing that mediation by him would be effective. His stupidity and flattery of foreigners reached this extreme! Grant met with Li and said some empty words about being most afraid of discord among countries and being willing to uphold justice. After he arrived in Japan, his adjutant, Yang Yuehan, threatened Li Hongzhang in a letter, saying: "In the eyes of the Japanese, China is seen as weak and their own country as strong, and whatever they do is successful... According to the Japanese, not only can Ryukyu be annexed, but even Taiwan and other territories can be invaded, and China will only use pen and ink to perfunctorily deal with it," and hypocritically believed that China could only avoid being bullied by foreigners by becoming "strong." At the same time, he asked the Qing government to replace its ambassador to Japan, and recommended U.S. Minister to Japan, Bingham, to Li Hongzhang, saying that he was the most reliable good man, because the Qing court's ambassador to Japan, He Ruzhang, had taken a tough stance against Japan in the negotiations on the Ryukyu issue and was close to the British Minister to Japan, Parkes. The United States was deeply afraid that the British minister would reveal the secret of Japanese-American collusion. Li Hongzhang later saw through the Americans' ulterior motives, saying that the United States had "far-reaching intentions in this matter" when secretly discussing the He Ruzhang issue with the "Zongli Yamen." The outcome of the Ryukyu issue was ultimately due to the United States' shielding of Japan and the Qing government's incompetence. After several exchanges of notes, it was like a clay ox entering the sea.

　　美国侵华史
    刘大年
　　一　追随或通过别国向中国侵略（续二）
    当皮雷在远东游历时，即认为美国有在东方保持一个海军根据地的必要，向政府建议以占领波宁群岛，琉球群岛及台湾为第一步，美国人派克尔（Ｍｒ．Ｐｅｔｅｒ　Ｐａｒｋｅｒ）一八五五年到中国任代表，打算实现这个计划，恰遇一八五七年有两个美国商人在台湾经营樟脑业，和台湾地方发生纠纷，美国驻香港海军舰队司令亚门司龙（Ｃｏｍｍｏｄｃｒｅ　Ａｒｍｓｔｒｏｎｇ）遂予以支持，在台湾竖起美国国旗，准备建立一个“独立国”，但当时美国在华的海军力量尚薄弱，不便轻举，只好宣称“商业的发展属私人企业的范围”，暂时作罢！至一八七三年（同治十二年）美国前驻福建领事李仙得（一名李让礼）竟率领美军向台湾进攻，台湾人民坚决抵抗，美国又不得手。清政府负责办理此项交涉的李鸿章给他朋友的信有“（台湾）生番地方险峻，美人屡攻不得手，李仙得虽曾去过，无奈伊何”。但美国侵占台湾的野心，并不因此稍息。第二年，李仙得到了日本，以一八七一年台番杀害琉球难民，琉球曾有人到日本诉冤，因之须对台湾加以“惩罚”为理由，怂恿日本进攻台湾。一八七四年（同治十三年），美日联合向台湾大举出兵。中国方面四月间得上海探信；“日本派柄川宫总督其事，李仙得参议……外国新报一万五千人，究竟兵数，不知实在，花旗公司船名“牛也克”装三千人，言为日本雇装兵丁前往……，”美国除了陆军参加外，又加入兵船，由美国水师官带领，这时清政府很清楚日本的行动是为美国驱使，日美已成一党，想用外交手段加以牵制。一八七四年五月李鸿章给“总理衙门”的条陈里有：“现日本船带兵头目多用美国武官，宜先解散其党，否则中国兵船内亦可暂用英法人以相抵制。”又同年九月给“总理衙门”的信上说：“冯道面称，英美实暗助日本，冀他日得利分肥，惟德国甚嫉之，而不与其党，若就斯议，似宜引德阴持各国……。”军事吃紧时，清政府令福建布政使潘＠往台湾帮办防务，潘＠过上海会见日本驻华代表柳原前光，经再三说服，柳原承认日本出兵是被美国利用，表示后悔。福州将军文煜等奏“日军扰台之情形”时说：“该酋始则一味推诿，继忽自承追悔，为西人所卖，商允退兵，有手书可据……。”后值日军台湾瘟疫大作，清政府又有派福建巡抚王凯泰将兵二万援台湾的拟议，日本大为气馁，派大久保利通来中国议和。美国看到情势不妙，美驻华副领事毕得格与总领事艾忻敏遂相继出面从事所谓“调停”。一八七四年八月（清七月二十四日）毕得格告诉清政府，台湾的事“我可从中转园”！同年十月艾忻敏更匆匆从美国转道日本来见李鸿章，称日本政府不愿因生番事件与中国失和，但望通融结办，并说“中美条约第一款载明，他国有何不公轻藐之事，必须相助从中调处，美国与日本和约内亦有此语，是调处乃我份内所应为……”，后又加上英使威妥玛的活动，清政府本无抵抗决心，乐得有人调停，便辟台湾为商埠，赔款五十万两了事。美国利用日本达到了插足台湾，开辟市场的目的。
    一八七六年，美国参加所谓“马嘉理案”的“调处”，通过英国取得宜昌芜湖等口岸通商权利。
    此后不久，美国又有袒护日本侵占琉球的一幕。琉球从十四世纪以后（明洪武以后），一直为中国属邦，一八七二年起日本即逐步并吞，至一八七九年（光绪五年）实行改琉球为冲绳县，清政府对此本不积极，说是不要“务虚名而勤远略”，琉球国王几次派人秘密到中国求救，情词异常凄惨迫切，清政府才认为性质严重，不得不争。适值美前总统格兰忒来华游历，并将赴日本，清政府的直隶总督李鸿章就想请格兰忒调处，李本人明知“日本实奉美国为护符”，但偏以为格兰忒是“众望所归”的公正人物，幻想由其调处得到效果，其昏庸媚外，至于此极！格兰忒与李见面，说了些最怕各国失和，甚愿秉公持议一类空话，他到日本之后，即一面由其随从副将杨越翰对李鸿章来信加以威吓说：“在日本人眼中每视中国弱，自家强，所为无不遂者……据日本人以为不但琉球可并，即台湾及各属地动兵侵占，中国亦不过以笔墨口舌支吾而已”，并假惺惺地以为中国只有“自强”，才能免被外人欺侮。一面要求清政府撤换驻日公使，并向李鸿章推荐美驻日公使平安，说他是最可靠的好人，因清廷驻日公使何如璋在交涉琉球问题中，对日态度强硬，且与英驻日使巴礼夏接近，美国深恐英使泄露日美勾结秘密。李鸿章后来倒也看破了美国人的阴私，在与“总理衙门”密论何如璋问题时，说美国“此事用意深远”，琉球问题归宿，终究因为美国的袒日，清政府的无能，几次照会来往之后，就如泥牛入海了。　　　（未完）
