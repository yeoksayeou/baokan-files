Introduction to Pingyuan Province

    The establishment of Pingyuan Province is the result of the long-term arduous struggle of the people of the whole country and Pingyuan Province, and it symbolizes the beginning of a new and more arduous construction task.

    During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, due to the enemy's military division, the Chinese people had to establish base areas in the border areas to better combat the enemy and persist in the struggle. Finally, under the leadership of the Communist Party, they won the great victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, and achieved the liberation of the entire North China region. In order to adapt to the needs of long-term construction in the future, Pingyuan Province was established on this basis.

    Pingyuan Province has a vast area, composed of western Shandong, northern Henan, and southern Hebei, and is a link between the North China and Central China liberated areas. The province governs six special districts, fifty-six counties, and two cities. The Huxi Special District governs seven counties (all belonging to the original Hebei-Shandong-Henan area): Jinxiang, Shanxian, Yutai, Juye, Chengwu, Jiaxiang (western Jining County), and Fucheng (southeastern part of Cao County); the Heze Special District governs seven counties (all belonging to the original Hebei-Shandong-Henan area): Heze, Cao County, Dongming, Dingtao, Juancheng, Youcheng, Liangshan (west of Dongping Lake, east of Shou Zhang, now named ＠shan); the Liaocheng Special District governs eleven counties, including eight counties from the original Hebei-Shandong-Henan area: Liaocheng, Renping, Boping, Yanggu, Shou Zhang, Dong'a (the part of Dong'a west of the Yellow River), and five counties from the original Hebei-South area: Gaotang, Qingping, Tangyi, Shen County, and Guan County; the Puyang Special District governs ten counties (all belonging to the original Hebei-Shandong-Henan area): Puyang, Chaocheng, Guancheng, Pu County, Nanle, Qingfeng, Hua County, Changyuan, Neihuang, and Fan County; the Xinxiang Special District governs fifteen counties, including nine counties from the original Taihang area: Xinxiang, Huojia, Wen County, Hui County, Ji County, Xiuwu, Wuzhi, Bo'ai, and Qinyang, four counties from the original Hebei-Shandong-Henan area: Fengqiu, Yanjin, Yuanwu, and Yangwu, and two counties from the original Taiyue area: Meng County and Jiyuan; the Anyang Special District governs six counties, including five counties from the original Taihang area: Anyang, Lin County, Ying County (Linzhang County, the part south of the Zhang River and parts of Anyang), Tangyin, and Qi County, and one county from the original Hebei-Shandong-Henan area: Jun County; and two provincial-level cities: Xinxiang City and Anyang City (both belonging to the original Taihang area).

    Most of Pingyuan Province is an old revolutionary base area. Only Anyang and Xinxiang in northern Henan and the counties along the Pinghan Railway were under the rule of the enemy and puppets for a long time and were only liberated in May of this year. The Party in Pingyuan Province has been tested and tempered through the Great Revolution, the Ten-Year Civil War, the Eight-Year War of Resistance, and the Three-Year People's Liberation War. Currently, there are more than 210,000 Party members in the province, accounting for 1.4% of the province's 15 million population, and more than 32,000 cadres who are detached from production. These Party members and cadres, under the leadership of the Communist Party, united the people and persisted in long-term struggle to achieve a great victory. In the future, they will still be the backbone of production and construction. There are more than 37,000 villages in the province. The old and semi-old areas that have undergone land reform have about 24,000 villages, including more than 9 million people; the restored areas that still need to complete land reform work have about 6,500 villages, including more than 2.18 million people; and the new areas that still need to vigorously mobilize the masses to implement land reform have about 6,000 villages, including more than 2.82 million people. The vast people of the province have been widely organized and mobilized in historical movements such as participating in the war, joining the army, supporting the front lines, land reform, and large-scale production. Especially the peasants who have undergone land reform have greatly increased their enthusiasm for production, which is the foundation for future development of agricultural production. In the revolutionary war and mass movements, a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance has been initially established. In addition to hundreds of thousands of peasants who have turned over and enthusiastically joined the army, there are still local troops, public security armed forces, and people's armed forces who have been tested by long-term war, totaling about hundreds of thousands of people. These are the main forces for eliminating special agents and bandits, consolidating revolutionary order, and protecting large-scale production.

    The land in Pingyuan Province is relatively fertile, with more than 44.8 million mu of arable land in the province. The main products are grain, cotton, and peanuts. In addition, pig bristles, white oil, black dates, fox skins, straw braid, and other products are also exported in large quantities every year. Northern Henan has abundant resources such as coal and iron, and has excellent conditions for developing industry. Except for the northern Henan area, cultural education in Pingyuan Province is relatively backward. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, with the advocacy and leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, there has been considerable development, but it is still far from the objective requirements. Therefore, while carrying out the production movement, vigorously restoring and developing cultural and educational undertakings has great significance in Pingyuan Province.

    The Yellow River runs across the entire Pingyuan Province for about a thousand miles. In the past, due to poor management, it was entirely a harmful river. However, under the leadership of the People's Government, the people along the river have repaired dikes and carried out emergency rescue operations, and have not suffered major harm in recent years. In addition, the Qin River, Zhang River, Wei River, and other rivers in the territory often cause floods due to the lack of proper canal construction and utilization. Therefore, how to develop water conservancy work, eradicate water disasters, and transform dry land into paddy fields has become one of the important tasks in the future production and construction of Pingyuan Province. The Pinghan and Daoqing railways and highway transportation in Pingyuan connect various cities and towns. The shipping on the Yellow River and Wei River has also played a considerable role in promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. In the future, it is still necessary to vigorously develop the transportation industry to further promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and restore and develop industrial and agricultural production.

　　平原省介绍
    平原省的建立，是全国人民和平原省人民长期艰苦斗争的结果，是象征着一个新的更加艰巨的建设任务的开始。
    在抗日战争及人民解放战争中，由于敌人的军事分割，中国人民曾不得不在边区建立根据地以更好的打击敌人，坚持斗争，终于在共产党的领导下，赢得了抗日战争及人民解放战争的伟大胜利，获得华北全区的解放。为了适应今后长期建设的需要，平原省就在这个基础上建立起来了。
    平原省地区广大，由山东的鲁西、河南的豫北、河北的直南三部组成，是华北与华中解放区联结的纽带。全省共辖六个专区，五十六个县和两个市。湖西专区辖七个县（均属原冀鲁豫地区）：金乡、单县、鱼台、钜野、城武、嘉祥（济宁县西部）和复程（曹县东南部分）；菏泽专区辖七个县（均属原冀鲁豫地区）：菏泽、曹县、东明、定陶、鄄城、邮城、梁山（东平湖西，寿张东，现名＠山）；聊城专区，共辖十一个县，内有原冀鲁豫区的八个县：聊城、荏平、博平、阳谷、寿张、东阿（黄河西之东阿部分），原冀南区的五个县：高唐、清平、堂邑、莘县、冠县；濮阳专区辖十个县（均属原冀鲁豫地区）：濮阳、朝城、观城、濮县、南乐、清丰、滑县、长垣、内黄、范县；新乡专区共辖十五个县，内有原太行区的九个县：新乡、获嘉、温县、辉县、汲县、修武、武陟、博爱、沁阳，有原冀鲁豫区的四个县，封邱、延津、原武、阳武，有原太岳区的两个县：孟县、济源；安阳专区共辖六个县，内有原太行区的五个县：安阳、林县、郢县（临漳县，漳河以南与安阳之各一部）、汤阴、淇县，原冀鲁豫区的一个县：浚县；省辖市两个：新乡市、安阳市（均属原太行地区）。
    平原省大部分地区是革命老根据地，只有豫北安阳、新乡及平汉铁路沿线县份，为敌伪统治时间较长，于今年五月间始获解放。平原省的党经过大革命、十年内战、八年抗战及三年人民解放战争的考验与锻炼，现全省共有党员廿一万余人，占全省一千五百万人口的百分之一点四，脱离生产的干部，共有三万二千余人。这些党员和干部，过去在共产党领导下，团结人民，坚持长期斗争，获得了伟大胜利，今后他们仍将是生产建设中的骨干。全省共有三万七千余村庄，经过土地改革的老区、半老区，约有两万四千余村，包括九百余万人口；尚待结束土地改革工作的恢复区约有六千五百余村庄，包括二百一十八万余人口；尚需大力发动群众贯彻土地改革的新区，约有六千余村庄，包括二百八十二万余人口。全省广大人民在参战、参军、支援前线、土地改革、大生产等历史运动中，已广泛的组织与发动起来，特别是经过土地改革的农民，生产积极性大为提高，这是今后发展农业生产的基础。在革命战争及群众运动中，已初步建立了工人阶级为领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。全省除数十万翻身的农民已先后踊跃参军外，现尚保有经过长期战争考验的地方部队、公安武装及人民武装，共约数十万人，这是肃清特务匪徒、巩固革命秩序、保卫大生产的主要力量。
    平原省土地尚称肥沃，全省共有可耕地四千四百八十余万亩，主要出产粮食、棉花和花生，此外，猪鬃、白油、乌枣、猾子皮、草帽辫等每年也大宗出口。豫北蕴藏煤、铁等丰富资源，具有发展工业的优越条件。平原省除豫北地区外，文化教育比较落后，在抗日战争及人民解放战争中，由于共产党及人民政府的提倡和领导，已有相当的发展，但距客观要求尚远。因此，与开展生产运动的同时，大量恢复和发展文化教育事业，在平原省有着重大的意义。
    平原省境内，黄河横贯全省，长约千里，以前由于不能很好治理，全系害河。但在人民政府领导下，沿河人民修堤抢险，数年来尚未蒙受大害。此外，境内沁河、漳河、卫河等河，因尚未很好开渠引用，常泛滥成灾。因此，如何开展水利工作，根绝水患、变旱田为水田，已成为平原省今后生产建设中重要工作之一。平原境内有平汉、道清两铁路及公路交通联结着各城镇，黄河及卫河的航运，对于城乡物资的交流，也起了相当推动的作用。今后，尚须大力发展运输事业，以进一步沟通城乡物资的交流，恢复和发展工农业生产。　　　　【新乡电】
