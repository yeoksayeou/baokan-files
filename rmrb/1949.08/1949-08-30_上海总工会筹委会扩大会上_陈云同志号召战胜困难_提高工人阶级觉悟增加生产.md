Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 29th. At an enlarged meeting convened by the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, Chen Yun, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, addressed the heads of trade union work groups and activists from all factories in Shanghai, calling on trade union workers throughout the city to educate the working class about their political status today, to face up to the current production difficulties, to grit their teeth, and to strive for the faster development of independent economic construction.

Comrade Chen Yun first asked: Has the political status of the working class in Shanghai changed after liberation? He said: It has changed, not a change in details, but a change in essence; it has changed from an oppressed class to a leading class. Anyone who does not understand this issue will make mistakes. Some people say: "Aren't workers still working for wages now?" But, you must know that there is no longer exploitation in state-owned enterprises, and workers are already the masters; workers in private enterprises, although on the one hand are still subject to the exploitation of capitalists, on the other hand are the leading class in the government. Therefore, the times have changed, the status of the working class has changed, and therefore our struggle methods should also shift from strikes and slowdowns against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism to consolidating our own regime, working hard to produce, and supporting the front lines. Although the vast majority of workers understand these changes, there are still some who do not, and we need to repeatedly explain them clearly.

Secondly, Comrade Chen Yun said: At present, we are still in a period when the military operations have not ended and the enemy is blockading us. National victory is certain, and it will not be long; although the blockade has given us difficulties, the consequence is to help us achieve self-reliance faster. However, we cannot only look to the future and not look at the present. Now the enemy's remaining forces are still to be eliminated; the enemy's blockade makes it difficult for us to obtain raw materials, sales channels, and transportation: most of the cotton comes from Hankou and North China, coal is in North China, and grain is in Hankou, Jiangxi, and Harbin; we do not have enough trains, and the ships are only small, and can only travel at night; the market has not been opened, sales are few, and many factories may have to reduce work, or even close down. But should we be discouraged by this? No! These difficulties should be compared with the difficulties encountered in the Chinese Communist Party's struggle for more than 20 years, which is only a small difficulty. As long as we face the difficulties, they can be overcome. This requires us to be fully prepared ideologically. For example, there is a possibility of lowering wages. The general wage in Shanghai is not high, and when workers received five dan of rice when it was first liberated, they thought it was good and said, "The revolution has succeeded." If this is really the case, the goal of the revolution is too low. Our ultimate goal of revolution is communism, which is to each according to their ability, to each according to their needs. But, comrades, when we encounter a large mountain on our march, should we detour? We are now encountering this situation, so we must temporarily detour. For example, how should we deal with those factories that are difficult to maintain? It is very difficult to maintain those factories that adapted to the abnormal development of Shanghai in the past, and the workers in these factories are in danger of temporary unemployment. Some factories can be helped up or allowed to fall, and now we must try to help them up so that they do not fall. Some people say: "Let them fall, it is better to fall sooner than later." This is an irresponsible attitude. For workers, being employed, no matter how hard, is better than being unemployed. For those factories that must fall, workers, trade unions, and capitalists should negotiate well on how to help unemployed workers overcome their difficulties. When there is no other way, planting fields for two years is better than starving, right? Trade union workers should be ideologically prepared to meet these difficulties. In the first year of Harbin's liberation, workers' wages were less than 200 jin of grain, and it was still one-third each of corn, millet, and sorghum. After gritting our teeth and repelling the enemy, after half a year, it was increased to 250 jin. Last year, when Shenyang was liberated, the average wage of heavy industry workers was raised to 150 points (each point of grain is 2.5 jin, equivalent to 375 jin), and labor insurance began to be implemented. This proves that after we overcome the difficulties, we will be better year by year. How long will the difficult period last? The length of time depends on three aspects: first, it depends on how fast the liberation of all of China is. The earlier the end of the War of Liberation, the earlier we can reduce our military expenditure and use the money for production. But at present, this money must be spent, and everything will be lost if the war is not completely won. Second, it depends on whether the government is doing a good job, how to produce under the most difficult conditions, and reduce the difficulties. Our People's Government will try its best to do so. Third, it depends on the awareness of the working class. Are the broad masses of workers thinking of ways with us, or are they disheartened and complaining about the difficulties? If it is the latter, it will increase the difficulties. Our trade union workers should mobilize workers to generally discuss how to maintain and increase production under the current difficult conditions, and how to overcome the difficulties. Comrades, don't be afraid of people saying bad things: "We don't have enough to eat after the Communist Party came!" Let the workers see: what did the Kuomintang do in the 22 years of rule? Now let us do it for a few years and see! Who made the workers' lives better?

Thirdly, Comrade Chen Yun explained the status and attitude of the working class in private factories. He said: We should recognize that private capital is an indispensable part of China's new democratic economy. Workers in private factories should improve production efficiency and increase production. Isn't this helping capitalists make money? Yes. But from the perspective of the whole of China, is it better to produce more or less? The working class cannot look at it from an individual perspective, but must look at the overall interest. Workers in private factories have the right to: (1) demand the implementation of labor-capital mutual benefit, (2) demand that capitalists abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Government; but they also have obligations, which are: (1) complete the original production plan, (2) abide by the contracts signed by both labor and capital, (3) abide by the government's laws and decrees to protect private enterprises. We must not only allow workers to fully enjoy their rights, but also educate workers to fulfill their due obligations. Of course, educating workers to fulfill their obligations is more difficult than educating workers to enjoy their rights, but we must do so.

Finally, Comrade Chen Yun said: Our workers must raise the political awareness of all workers and eliminate the black market of speculation in the labor movement. Shanghai workers have a revolutionary tradition, but there are also a few special agents hidden inside. They put forward excessive economic demands and emphasize partial and temporary interests, as if they can "represent" the interests of the workers. We must tell all workers: representing the interests of workers is not just about talking, but about showing facts. Special agents cannot escape our palms. It is relatively easy to catch special agents, but more importantly, we must better organize the workers and educate those workers with low levels of awareness who agree with both Zhang San and Li Si. We must run more study classes and give large lectures to clearly distinguish the boundaries between enemies and friends, right and wrong. In short, comrades, what we must face is the current production difficulties; as long as the working class and the government work together to find solutions, the difficulties can definitely be overcome.

　　上海总工会筹委会扩大会上
  　陈云同志号召战胜困难
    提高工人阶级觉悟增加生产
    【新华社上海二十九日电】中共中央政治局委员、中华全国总工会主席陈云，二十五日在上海市总工会筹委会召集的扩大会议中向全市各工厂工会工作组组长及积极分子讲话，号召全市工运工作者教育全市工人阶级认识今天工人阶级政治地位，正视当前生产中的困难，咬紧牙关，争取更快地发展独立自主的经济建设。
    陈云同志首先问道：解放后上海工人阶级的政治地位是否起了变化呢？他说：变了，不是枝节的变，而是本质上的变；是从被压迫阶级，一变而为领导阶级。谁不弄清楚这个问题，谁就会犯错误。有人说：“现在工人还不是做工拿工钱吗？”但是，要知道，国营企业中已经没有了剥削，工人已经是主人；私营企业中的工人，虽一方面仍然受资本家的剥削，但另一方面又是政府中的领导阶级。所以时代变了，工人阶级的地位变了，因此我们的斗争方式也应由对付帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的罢工怠工，转而为巩固自己的政权，努力生产，支援前线。这些变化虽然绝大多数工人都了解了，但也还有一部分不了解，这就须要我们反复地给他们讲清楚。
    其次，陈云同志说：目前我们还处于军事没有结束、敌人对我进行封锁的时期。全国胜利是确定了，且不会很久；封锁虽给了我们困难，但后果是帮助我们更快地达到自力更生。可是，我们不能只望将来，不看现在。现在是敌人的残余势力尚待肃清；敌人的封锁使我们原料、销路、运输都有困难：棉花大部来自汉口、华北，煤炭在华北，粮食在汉口、江西、哈尔滨；我们的火车不够，航船只有小的，还要晚上才能走；市场没有打开，销路很少，许多工厂可能要减工，甚至可能要关门。但是否就因此而灰心失望呢？不是的！这些困难要和中国共产党二十多年奋斗中所碰到的困难来比，不过是一个小困难。只要我们正视困难，困难是可以克服的。这就要求我们要在思想上作充分准备。比如，工资就有降低的可能性。上海一般的工资并不高，才解放时工人拿到五担米，觉得不错，说“革命成功了”。如果真是这样，革命的目标未免太低了。我们革命的最终目标是共产主义，是各尽所能，各取所需。但是，同志们，当我们行军途中碰到一座大山时，是否要绕道前进呢？我们现在就碰到了这种情况，所以就要暂时绕道前进。比如对那些很难维持的工厂，我们应如何处理呢？过去那些适应上海畸形发展的工厂是很难维持的，这些工厂的工人有暂时失业的危险。有些工厂则是可扶可倒，现在我们就是要力求把他扶起，使他不要倒。有人说：“倒就倒吧，迟倒不如早倒。”这是不负责任的态度。对工人来说，在业无论如何苦，总比失业好。对那些一定要倒的工厂，工人、工会、资本家要好好协商，如何协助失业工人渡过困难。最没有办法时，种他两年田，总比挨饿好吧？工会工作同志们应在思想上准备迎接这些困难。哈尔滨解放第一年，工人工资不到二百斤粮食，还是玉米、小米、高粱各三分之一。咬紧牙关打退敌人后，过了半年，才加到二百五十斤。去年解放沈阳，重工业工人工资平均提高到一五○分（每分粮食二点五斤，合三七五斤），并开始举办劳动保险。这证明我们在克服困难后，是会一年比一年好的。困难时期有多长呢？时间长短，决定于三方面：第一决定于解放全中国的快慢。解放战争结束得早，就能早减少我们的军费支出，把钱用到生产事业上来。但目前这个钱是一定要花的，战争不完全胜利，一切都落空。第二决定于政府工作做得好不好，如何在最困难的条件下设法生产，减少困难。我们人民政府是会尽量努力这样做的。第三决定于工人阶级的觉悟。广大的工人是和我们一起来想办法呢，还是对困难灰心埋怨呢？假如是后者，那就会使困难之上更增加着困难。我们总工会工作同志要发动工人普遍来讨论在目前困难的条件下如何维持和增加生产，如何渡过困难的问题。同志们不要害怕人家说坏话：“共产党来了反而没有饭吃了！”要工友们看看：国民党统治二十二年做了些什么呢？现在让我们来做它几年看看！究竟是谁使工人生活过好了呢？
    再次，陈云同志说明工人阶级在私营工厂里的地位和态度。他说：我们应认识私营资本是中国新民主主义经济中不可缺少的部分。在私营工厂中的工人，应当提高生产效率，增加生产。这不是帮资本家赚钱吗？是的。但是从整个中国来讲，生产品多好呢，还是少好呢？工人阶级不能单从个人来看，要看整个利益。在私营工厂中的工人有权利：（一）要求实行劳资两利，（二）要求资本家遵守人民政府的法令；但也有义务，这就是：（一）完成原定生产计划，（二）遵守劳资双方订定的契约，（三）遵守政府保护私营企业的法令。我们不但要工人充分享受自己的权利，同时也一定要教育工人尽自己应尽的义务。当然教育工人尽义务要比教育工人享权利更困难，但我们一定要这样做。
    最后，陈云同志说：我们工作同志要提高全体工人的政治认识，消灭工人运动中投机倒把的黑市场。上海工人是有革命传统的，但也有少数特务分子隐藏在里面，他们提出过高的经济要求，强调局部的暂时的利益，似乎顶能“代表”工人的利益。我们要告诉全体工友：代表工人利益，不是单靠讲，要拿出事实来看。特务们是逃不出我们的手掌的，要抓特务是比较容易的事，但更重要的我们要更好地组织工人，教育那些张三说也对、李四说也对的觉悟程度不高的工人。我们要多办学习班，上大课，把敌人和朋友，正确和错误的界线划清楚。总之，同志们，我们要正视的是目前生产上的困难；只要工人阶级和政府一致起来想办法，困难是一定能克服的。
