    The Control Yuan Accepts Public Accusations to Thoroughly Investigate Personnel Involved in Shopping Improprieties
    [This newspaper report] The North China People's Government Control Yuan sent a letter yesterday (the 8th) to this newspaper's reader service group, replying to reader Jian Xuchu of the former Beiping Liberation Daily, who reported that personnel of the People's Bank of China had purchased light bulbs and embezzled 1,000 yuan. The case has been forwarded by the People's Control Yuan to the People's Bank for thorough investigation and criticism of the illegal personnel. The original letter is recorded below:
    To the Reader Service Group: Regarding reader Jian Xuchu's accusation forwarded by the former Beiping Liberation Daily's reader service group, alleging that the General Affairs Section of the People's Bank of China embezzled 1,000 yuan when purchasing light bulbs from Huatai Electric Material Store, we immediately sent a letter to the People's Bank for thorough investigation. On August 2nd, we received a reply, General Dispatch No. 33 from the bank, which stated: "On March 23rd, Li Xiangting, a staff member of the Materials Section of the Issuing Department of this bank, purchased 1,000 light bulbs on behalf of the Beiping People's Printing Factory. Because Li had only recently arrived in Beiping and was unfamiliar with the local area, he used Zhao Chaoru as an agent. Initially, the seller demanded 95 yuan per bulb, but after several negotiations by Zhao, the price was agreed at 90 yuan. At that time, it was stated that Huatai would not pay a commission, so Zhao requested a commission of one yuan per bulb from Li Xiangting. Li Xiangting considered this transaction cheaper than the market price and agreed. The invoice was then written with each bulb costing 91 yuan. The bank sent the light bulbs to the People's Printing Factory, and 91,000 yuan was collected back. Huatai actually received 90,000 yuan, and Zhao Chaoru received 1,000 yuan (the letter stated 100 yuan per bulb, but the actual payment was 99 yuan, which is inconsistent with the facts). The People's Government has long prohibited government personnel from receiving kickbacks when purchasing goods, but Li Xiangting allowed Zhao Chaoru to collect a kickback, engaged in illegal impropriety, concealed the matter from his superiors, and created suspicion of corruption. Furthermore, he neither requested instructions beforehand nor reported the matter afterward, demonstrating a lack of organization and discipline. He has been severely criticized. Through our repeated and careful investigation, the business was deeply moved, believing that only the People's Government could have such a responsible spirit. Attached are two reports from Huatai," etc. We are informing you of this matter so that you can provide a factual response to the reader.

    监察院接受人民检举
    澈查购物舞弊人员
    【本报讯】华北人民政府监察院于昨（八）日致函本报读者服务组，答复前北平解放报读者见旭初检举人民银行人员购买灯泡私吞一千元事。该案已经人民监察院函人民银行澈查并予违法人员以批评处理，兹录原函于下：
    迳启者：前北平解放报读者服务组转来读者见旭初检举人民银行总务科在华泰电料行购买电灯泡私吃一千元事，当即函人民银行澈查，于八月二日接该行总发字第三三号复函略称：“缘于三月二十三日本行发行处材料科行员李祥庭代北平人民印刷厂买灯泡一千个，因李到平不久，人地两生，经跑合（经纪）赵超儒代买，最初卖主每个索价九十五圆，后经赵几次说合，以九十元成交，当时言明华泰不出佣钱，赵即向李祥庭要求每灯泡取佣金一圆，李祥庭认为此项交易较市价便宜，当允许，并在开发票时写明每个灯泡九十一圆，该行将灯泡送至人民印刷厂，当取回九万一千圆，华泰实收九万圆，赵超儒得一千圆（信上所说每灯泡一百元，实付九十九圆与事实不合）。此事人民政府早已禁止机关人员购买货物收取回扣流弊，李祥庭竟允许赵超儒收取回扣，违法舞弊蒙蔽上级，造成贪污嫌疑，且事前既未请示，事后又未报告，是无组织无纪律作风，已予该李祥庭处以严重批评。由于我们反复认真调查，该商号深为感动，认为只有人民政府，才会有此种负责精神。并附华泰报告两纸”等情，特此函告请具情答复读者是荷。
