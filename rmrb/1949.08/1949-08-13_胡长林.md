    Hu Changlin

    My colleague Hu Changlin came from a strictly disciplined feudal family in Pudong. His family wasn't well-off, and his parents didn't value their children's education. He didn't finish middle school and was sent to a paint store in Zhenjiang to "learn the trade."

    The life of an old-fashioned apprentice was one of mistreatment. Logically, he should have resisted, but influenced by his background and family education, he not only submitted to this unreasonable life but, after "graduating," even put on the airs of "a slave who, when he becomes a master, treats slaves even more harshly than the original master," lording it over his "junior apprentices"!

    During the Japanese imperialist invasion of southern Jiangsu, he acquired a windfall and opened a shop. Then, "with plenty of food and warm clothes comes lustful desires," his life became even more corrupt – gambling, whoring, and frequenting nightclubs, he did it all! But his good fortune didn't last. After the victory against Japan, he couldn't withstand the Kuomintang reactionaries' exorbitant taxes and his own lavish spending. His "business" collapsed in the storm!

    So, a year before liberation, he had to lower himself again and came to our factory as a shop assistant. Naturally, his income wasn't great, and with frequent price fluctuations, life was even more difficult. But due to his past habits, even though he could no longer live as extravagantly as before, he still tried to put on his old "stinking airs" everywhere – even if he was in debt, he still had to smoke good cigarettes, gambling had to be "shark crab" at a minimum, clothes had to be ironed before he'd wear them, and so on.

    I worked with him for over a year, and we got along well on a personal level. But when it came to political issues, he was not only unclear but also held deep-seated prejudices. Sometimes he would grumble, and it was always from his personal interests. Coupled with the long-term deceptive propaganda of the Kuomintang reactionaries, he still had a "murder and arson" wariness of the Communist Party. When we explained things to him, he wouldn't believe us.

    On May 12th, he went home. The next day, the Kuomintang bandit troops in Pudong, Nanhui, Chuansha, and other places were defeated, and his hometown was liberated! He didn't return until May 26th, after the area south of the Suzhou Creek in Shanghai was liberated. But in those short two weeks, his attitude changed drastically. He said: he personally saw that it was not the "Eighth Route Army" who were "murdering and setting fires" but themselves! He gave two examples: when the People's Liberation Army attacked Zhoupu bus station, the bandits indiscriminately machine-gunned the civilians; the People's Liberation Army, in addition to calmly surrounding the area, also marked a safe zone in a nearby liberated area and shouted during the battle, "Please run to the safe areas marked with flags!" This spirit of self-sacrifice deeply moved him! Therefore, when the People's Liberation Army entered Xinti Town, that night it rained heavily, and they had nowhere to stay, so they knocked on the doors of the people; the people, having suffered enough from the bandits, dared not open their doors. The next morning, when they opened the doors and saw the People's Liberation Army lying on the steps, the people were ashamed and blamed each other...

    From then on, he became very talkative – spreading the vivid picture of this contrast that he had personally experienced everywhere! One day, when the People's Liberation Army borrowed a private residence next door to our boss, our landlady became anxious and expressed doubt about the "Eight Disciplines" promulgated by the People's Liberation Army! At this time, some colleagues who were originally clearer-headed became silent, but he loudly explained to the landlady the strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army using various facts. Later, the facts proved that this was indeed the case, and he spoke even more.

    同事胡长林出身在浦东一个管教极严的封建家庭里。家境不大好，再加上父母不重视子女教育，没有读完中学就被送到镇江一家颜料店去“学生意”。
    旧式学徒的生活，就是受虐待的生活。论理他应反抗，可是由于他出身与家庭教育影响，他不但顺从了这种不合理的生活，而且在“出师”后，反摆出一种“奴隶当了主人对待奴隶反比主人凶”的架子，高高地爬在他的“师弟”们头上作威作福起来！
    在日本帝国主义侵略江南时，他弄到一笔横财，开了一爿店，于是“饱暖思淫欲”，他的生活反加腐化了——赌钱，嫖女人，坐台子样样都来！可是好景不长，抗战胜利后，经不起国民党反动派苛捐杂税与他自己花天酒地的浪费，他的“事业”就在这大风浪中倒下去了！
    于是在解放前一年，不得不重又降低身份，来到我们厂中当伙计，收入自然不太好，那时物价又常波动，生活更其困难。可是由于过去的积习，他这时虽然生活得再不能象以前那样荒唐，但处处地方还想摆出他过去的“臭架子”——即使是借了债，烟还是要抽挺好的，赌钱又非“沙蟹”不过瘾，衣服没有烫过不上身等等。
    我与他同事一年多，在私人感情上相处得很好，可是谈到政治问题，他不但模糊而且还保有极深的成见；有时也会发一些牢骚，那也完全是站在他个人利益上出发的，再加上国民党反动派的长期欺骗宣传，他对共产党还抱有一种“杀人放火”的戒心，同他解释，他也不相信。
    五月十二日那天他回家去，在第二天，浦东、南汇、川沙等地国民党匪军大败，他的家乡也随即解放！这样直到五月二十六日上海苏州河以南解放以后他才回来。可是在这短短的半月中，他的生活态度大变了，他说：他亲眼看到了宣传“杀人放火”的不是“八路”而是他们自己！他举出二个例子说：在解放军进攻周浦汽车站时，匪帮见老百姓就用机枪扫射；解放军除沉着包围之外，还在附近一个已经解放了的地区按上标注，在战斗中回头高喊：“请老百姓跑向插有标记的安全区域！”这种舍己救人的精神，令他深深感动！因此，当解放军入新惕镇，那晚，雨下得很大，无处寄宿而向老百姓叫门；老百姓因吃够了匪军的苦，不敢开门。第二天清晨打开门来看见解放军就躺在阶沿上时，老百姓都惭愧得自相责怪起来……。
    从此，他变得非常多嘴——到处宣扬着他亲身经历过的这幅鲜明的对比图画！有一天，解放军在本市借住了我们老板隔壁一家私人住宅时，我们底老板娘发起急来，对人民解放军所颁布的“约法八章”表示了怀疑！这时有几位原来头脑比较清楚的同事倒反弄得不发一言，而他却用种种事实大声疾呼的向老板娘解释解放军的纪律严明。后来事实证明果然如此，他的话就更多了。
