Several Opinions on Carrying Out the Autumn Seed Selection Movement
Technical Improvement Department of the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government

Autumn seed selection is an important link to ensure increased production next year, and this work must be carried out conscientiously. The improved varieties we have promoted in the past have all produced more than ordinary varieties. For example, purebred "Sizi Cotton", if properly cultivated and managed, can increase production by 30% to 50% compared to ordinary cotton; "811" millet can increase production by 10% to 20% compared to ordinary millet; and the improved wheat varieties such as "Qiuzi Wheat" promoted in the Hebei-Luyu area and "Guangzong White" and "Yulin White" in the South Hebei area all have characteristics of increased production. In addition, seed selection also plays a considerable role in the prevention of diseases and insect pests. In recent years, diseases and insect pests have occurred continuously in various parts of North China, such as "white hair disease" of millet, "wheat smut" (black jaundice), "wheat rust" (yellow jaundice), "wheat nematode disease", "wheat bunchy top" (egg yolk disease) of wheat, and "smut" of sorghum and corn, which have become more serious year by year, greatly reducing harvests. This illustrates the importance of seed selection. Facts have proved that as long as the variety is good, the masses are very willing to select seeds. In the past years, many farmers in various regions have carried out seed selection and achieved considerable results. For example, this year the Hebei-Luyu area selected 800,000 jin of "Qiuzi Wheat". The second and third special districts of Taihang selected 3 million jin of relatively good local wheat varieties (among which the best "red spike wheat" does not produce black mold or yellow jaundice, and is resistant to wind and drought, has high yield, and produces more flour). The Chencun Technical Committee of the Second District of Licheng led eight mutual aid groups to select seeds, and selected 14 dan and 5 dou of "red spike wheat" in five days.

In seed selection work, first of all, pay attention to cotton seed selection. After the liberation of major cities across the country, machine spinning urgently needs a large amount of high-quality raw cotton. Relying only on the existing Sizi Cotton No. 2 and Sizi Cotton No. 4 in certain counties along the Pinghan and Jinpu lines is far from meeting the needs. In the past, North China promoted a lot of Sizi Cotton No. 4, mainly distributed in Hebei Province and northern Henan, such as Shijiazhuang and Zhengding in Hebei and Anyang in northern Henan. The purity is still well maintained. In some areas, farmers have mixed with American cotton, and after natural hybridization, some of the qualities have become better (of course, inferior qualities should be eliminated) and have been fixed. If seed selection can be carried out widely in these better cotton fields (overall seed retention or partial seed retention), a large number of high-quality cotton seeds can be selected. In order to achieve the goal of selecting and harvesting good seeds, the selected seed cotton must be ginned in an organized manner. Cooperatives should take on the task of organizing ginning and selecting and harvesting good seeds (such as village cooperatives organizing their own ginning, or organizing small cooperative ginning factories) to specifically gin seed cotton for seed retention. Secondly, the issue of cotton seed allocation should also be selected and collected in a planned way to prevent the formation of greater mixing of cotton varieties with the large increase in cotton field area. This year's more than 320,000 mu of Sizi Cotton No. 2 promoted in North China still has more than 200,000 mu remaining after disaster losses, which must be well organized for seed retention. In terms of methods, in addition to organizing the masses to retain seeds themselves, the Cotton Production Improvement Office should purchase good seed cotton at a higher price, and through the management and processing of seed cotton, control 6 million jin of high-quality cotton seeds for promotion next year.

Secondly, this year, excellent millet varieties should be selected, enough to sow 2 million mu of land. There are two ways to select seeds: one is to call on the masses to retain their own seeds before the autumn harvest, and universally organize the masses to carry out ear selection in the fields. This work can be done by women and children as long as they are well mobilized. The other is that we must try to select and retain more seeds of excellent varieties that we have determined to promote or that are recognized by the masses after investigation and research. Before the autumn harvest, mobilize the masses to observe in the fields, hold seminars, and mobilize the masses to harvest the carefully selected high-quality seeds separately. For example, in areas that specialize in planting Huano No. 5, all those that are not Huano No. 5, or diseased plants or inferior plants, should be harvested first, and the remaining high-quality pure varieties should then be harvested separately, threshed (threshing floor) separately, and stored separately.

The improved varieties that have been harvested separately after removing impurities and inferior varieties can be exchanged for public grain with an added percentage. If seed farmers hand in seeds, they can add one top of public grain. If the original seed farmers have no public grain burden, the village can organize allocation. If the village does not have it, it can be allocated by neighboring villages, but it must be guaranteed to give good grain so that the original seed farmers do not suffer losses. Purchasing good seeds is to maintain pure varieties for centralized promotion. It is a detailed organizational work. It is hoped that each province, special district, and county can organize a group of people to specialize in this work. After the seeds are collected, seed warehouses should be established to properly preserve them and strictly prevent insect damage, moisture, mixing, and other phenomena, and according to the opinions of the good seed management area issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, with reference to local conditions, delimit the good seed area and formulate good seed management methods. Then transport the good seeds to the good seed area for centralized promotion, so as to continue to select pure seeds and continue to expand outward every year.

In recent years, due to the serious development of diseases and insect pests, special attention should be paid to selecting more high-quality varieties with strong disease resistance, insect resistance, and resistance to all natural disasters in this year's autumn seed selection. In addition to seed dressing with pesticides and hot water soaking, seed selection is also a reliable basic method for preventing and controlling various diseases. For example, the masses are very willing to plant "Qiuzi Wheat" and "Red Spike Wheat" in Hebei-Luyu because they are resistant to yellow jaundice disease, and the awnless "White Monk Head Wheat" is also suitable for retaining as a good seed because it can resist "yellow jaundice disease," "smut," and "wheat nematode disease." The selected seeds must be disinfected before wheat is sown. This year we will start to eliminate "wheat smut" and "wheat nematode disease" and other work. It is required that all "Ceresan" and "Longgong" distributed to various places be used for seed dressing. Because the amount of medicine is limited, the promotion of seed dressing should also be focused on. It should be carried out first in areas with serious diseases and in areas promoting improved varieties. In areas with serious "wheat nematode disease" and "wheat bunchy top disease," the masses should also be mobilized to select seeds with salt water, mud water, or sieves.

Autumn crops are about to mature, cotton has begun to be picked, and wheat is about to be sown. In order to ensure increased agricultural production next year, the autumn seed selection work in various places this year should be made into a mass agricultural activity. It is hoped that various places can report the seed selection situation level by level.

　　开展秋季选种运动的几点意见
    华北人民政府农业部技术改进处
    秋季选种是保证明年增产的一个重要环节，这一工作必须认真进行。我们过去推广的优良品种，都比一般品种产量大，例如：纯种的“斯字棉”，如果栽培管理得法，较普通棉花，可以增产百分之三十到五十；“八一一”谷，比一般谷子可增产百分之十到二十；冀鲁豫区推广的“蝤子麦”，冀南区的“广宗白”“鱼鳞白”等小麦优良品种，都具有增产特点。另外，选种对于病虫害的预防，也有相当作用，几年来，华北各地不断发生病害和虫害，如谷子的“白发病”，小麦的“黑穗病”（黑疸）、“黄锈病”（黄疸）、“腺虫病”、“密穗病”（鸡蛋黄）以及高粱、玉茭的“黑穗病”，一年比一年严重，减少收成很大，这说明了选种工作的重要。事实证明，只要是好的品种，群众是非常愿意选种的，各地区历年来曾有许多农民进行选种，取得了相当成绩，如今年冀鲁豫区便选了“蝤子麦”八十万斤。太行二、三专区，把当地较好的麦种，选了三百万斤（其中最好的“红穗麦”，不生乌霉、黄疸，且能抗风、抗旱，产量大，出面多）。黎城二区陈村技术委员会，领导八个互助组选种，五天内即选了“红穗麦”十四石五斗。
    在选种工作上，首先要注意棉花选种。全国各大城市解放后，机器纺纱，急需大量的优良原棉，仅靠现有已推广的斯字棉二号与平汉津浦沿线某些县的斯字棉四号，还远远赶不上需要。过去，华北曾推广不少斯字棉四号，主要地区分布在河北省及豫北，如河北石家庄、正定及豫北安阳一带，现在纯度的保持还相当好，还有某些地区农民因混种美棉，经过自然杂交后，里边有的品质已经变优（当然品质恶劣的应予淘汰），且已固定，如果能在这些较好的棉田内广泛的进行选种（全面留种或局部留种），就可以选出大量的优良棉种。为了达到选收良种的目的，选出的籽棉，要有组织的进行轧花。合作社应担负起组织轧花、选收良种的任务（如村合作社自己组织轧花，或组织小型合作轧花厂），专轧留种的籽棉。其次，关于棉花种子调剂问题，也要有计划的进行选收，以防止随着棉田面积的大量增加，形成棉花品种更大的混杂。今年华北推广的三十二万多亩斯字棉二号，除因灾害损失外，仍有二十多万亩，须要很好组织留种。在办法上，除组织群众自己留种外，棉产改进处应该以较高价格收购良种籽棉，并通过经营籽棉加工，掌握优良棉籽六百万斤，以备明年推广。
    其次，今年要选出优良谷子品种，足够播种二百万亩之用。选种的办法有两种：一种是在秋收前号召群众自己留种，普遍的组织群众到田间进行穗选，这一工作只要动员好了，妇女儿童都能去做。再一种是我们确定推广或经过调查研究群众公认的优良品种，要尽量多选留做种。在秋收前并发动群众到田间观察，召开座谈会，动员群众把精选的良种分开来收。例如专门种华农五号的地区，凡不是华农五号的，或病株、劣株，一律先收，留下的优良纯种，然后再单独收割，单独脱粒（打场），单独藏放。
    经过去杂去劣单独收割的优良品种，可以公粮加成收换，如果种户交种，可以加一顶公粮，原种户无公粮负担，村中可以组织调剂，本村没有可由邻村调剂，但必须保证给好粮食，不使原种户吃亏。收购良种是为了保持纯种集中推广，是一个细致组织的具体工作，希望各省、专、县能组织一批力量专门进行这一工作。种籽收起后，要建立种籽仓库，妥为保存，严防虫伤、潮湿、混杂等现象，并可根据农业部所发的良种管理区意见，参照本地情况，划定良种区，拟定良种管理办法。然后把良种运到良种区，集中推广，做到每年继续选纯，继续向外扩展。
    近几年来由于病虫害的发展严重，因此，在今年秋季选种中，要特别注意多选抗病、抗虫及抵抗一切自然灾害力强的优良品种。各种病害的防除，除了药剂拌种及温汤浸种以外，选种也是一个可靠的基本办法。如冀鲁豫“蝤子麦”、“红穗麦”能抗黄疸病，群众就非常愿意种，无芒“白和尚头麦”，能抵抗“黄疸病”、“黑穗病”、“腺虫病”等亦宜留作良种。已选出来的种籽，在小麦未下种以前，要经过种籽消毒。今年我们要开始来进行消灭“小麦黑穗病”及“腺虫病”等工作。要求各地将发下去的“赛力散”及“龙汞”全部用于拌种。因为药剂数量有限，推广药剂拌种也要有重点，应该先尽病害严重的地区，推广优良品种的地区进行，在“腺虫病”“密穗病”严重地区，并要发动群众用盐水、泥水或筛子选种。
    秋季作物即将成熟，棉花已开始摘收，麦子快要下种，为了保证明年农业增产，各地今年的秋季选种工作，使之成为群众性的农事活动。并望各地能把选种情况逐级上报。
