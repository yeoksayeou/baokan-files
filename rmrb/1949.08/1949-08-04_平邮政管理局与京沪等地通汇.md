    Peiping Postal Administration Opens Money Order Services with Nanjing, Shanghai and Other Places
    [Peiping City News] The Peiping Postal Administration and its subordinate branches have opened money order services with Nanjing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and other places. The exchange rate is uniformly 2.5 per mille (August 3rd market rate - this rate is adjusted at any time according to the People's Bank of China's postings). The remittance limit is 100,000 yuan for Nanjing, 200,000 yuan for Shanghai, and from 10,000 to 100,000 yuan for other places such as Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and Pukou.
    In addition, the Peiping Post Office and Tianjin also offer telephone money order services, which are cheaper than telegraph money orders.
