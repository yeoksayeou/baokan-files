　　Artillerymen's Poetry
    Lin Shichai
    "Gun-barrel poetry" has already become a mass literary activity among infantry units, but in the artillery it is only just beginning. First, because our artillery history is much younger than that of the infantry; second, artillery, apart from training, is generally in a dispersed environment, so the exchange and promotion of experiences in this regard are somewhat limited. Therefore, the development of the "gun-barrel poetry" movement in the artillery is relatively slow. However, a seed that has sprouted will grow branches and leaves.
    The following is a selection of "gun-barrel poems" created before the Taiyuan Campaign. Some were created by soldiers, some by clerks, and some by company and platoon leaders, as well as staff officers. Although these creations may not seem mature enough, they are indeed loved by the soldiers. If more specific help can be given, it is believed that they will quickly improve from the existing foundation.
    In the artillery, there is even more need for shovels and pickaxes than in the infantry, to dig communication trenches, shelters, and construct artillery positions. Shovels and pickaxes are inseparable from the artillery. Our sharpshooters have praised them in this way:

     My pickaxe and shovel,
     Are first in constructing fortifications;
     Making them quickly and sturdily,
     Just waiting to fire and hit Taiyuan.

　　There are also poems about shells, such as:

     Shells sharp and pointy,
     Leaving with black smoke;
     Asked what they're doing?
     Going to fight Yan Xishan.

    There are mortars, mountain guns, anti-tank guns, field guns, howitzers, etc. Soldiers use whatever guns they use in poems to praise them.

　　I. Mortar

     My shell is sharp and pointy,
     My gun body is round and round;
     Destroying countless bunkers,
     Eliminating tens of thousands of enemies.

　　II. French Field Gun

     My name is French gun,
     Making a loud bang when fighting;
     Hitting accurately every time,
     Glorious flag flying on the gun;
     Aiming range has been measured,
     Position equipment is well constructed.
     Just waiting for the order to be given,
     To make a contribution under Taiyuan City.

　　III. Anti-Tank Gun

　   Anti-tank gun, made in Japan,
     The tank is the mouse, you are the cat;
     As long as we aim well,
     Guaranteed you'll have a full meal in wartime.

　　IV. Howitzer

     Howitzer, really good,
     We'll go attack Taiyuan City;
     If Yan's bandits don't surrender,
     Resolutely fight them relentlessly.

    Howitzers must be towed by trucks. They also have poems praising the towing trucks:

     Towing truck, made in Germany,
     Carrying shells and pulling the gun;
     Pulling the howitzer forward,
     Everyone cheers when they see it,
     Pulling the gun into the position,
     Blowing the bunkers to smithereens.

    These "gun-barrel poems" above, with the exception of individual typos and slightly modified sentences, have been kept in their original state. These writers are generally of lower secondary school level or below. Now, what is noteworthy is: how to help them improve. Because some people feel that writing the same old thing over and over again, their enthusiasm is not as great as before. To solve this problem, it is best if someone in the National Association of Literary Workers is specifically responsible for collecting, sorting out, and publishing quick-clappers and "gun-barrel poems" from the troops (because this is a very popular thing in terms of literature). Then send them to the troops. On the one hand, the works can be promoted, and on the other hand, they can see their own works after being modified, which is also a great help to the creator himself. But as far as we know, the publication of "gun-barrel poems" is currently limited to the mimeographed newspapers of the troops.

### 炮兵的诗

　　炮兵的诗
    林十柴
    枪杆诗在部队的步兵中已经成为一种群众性的文艺活动，但在炮兵里还只是刚刚开始：第一，因为我们炮兵的历史比起步兵来还年青得多；第二，炮兵除了整训外，一般的是在分散的环境下，因此，一些关于这方面的经验交流和推广上多少要受些限制。所以，枪杆诗运动在炮兵中的发展是比较来得缓慢的。但是，种子已经发芽，就会长出枝叶来。
    下面是从太原战役前创作的枪杆诗里挑出来的。这里面有战士创作的，也有文书创作的，也有连排长及参谋干事们创作的，虽然看起来这些创作还不够成熟，但它确是战士们所喜爱的。如果再能给以具体帮助，相信就会很快从现有基础上提高起来的。
    在炮兵里比步兵里更需要洋锹洋镐用它挖交通沟，掩蔽部，构筑炮的阵地。洋锹洋镐在炮兵里是一刻也离不了的，我们的神炮手们曾这样的在歌颂它：
     我的洋镐和洋锨，
     构筑工事它在先；
     做的快来又坚固，
     单等发射打太原。
　　写炮弹的也有，如：
     炮弹尖又尖，
     临走冒黑烟；
     问它干什么？
     去打阎锡山。
    炮有迫击炮、山炮、战防炮、野炮、榴弹炮等，战士们自己使用什么炮，就用诗来歌颂什么炮。
　　一、迫击炮
     我这炮弹尖又尖，
     我这炮身圆又圆；
     摧毁碉堡无其数，
     消灭敌人万万千。
　　二、法式野炮
     我的名字法式炮，
     打起仗来呱呱叫；
     百发百中打的准，
     光荣旗帜炮上飘；
     瞄准射程已测定，
     阵地设备构筑好。
     单等号令一声下，
     太原城下立功劳。
　　三、战防炮
　   战防炮来日本造，
     战车是鼠你是猫；
     只要咱们瞄准好，
     战时保你吃个饱。
　　四、榴弹炮
     榴弹炮，真是行，
     咱去攻打太原城；
     阎匪他若不缴枪，
     坚决打个不留情。
    榴弹炮必须用汽车牵引，对牵引汽车他们也有歌颂它的诗：
     牵引汽车德国造，
     载着炮弹拉着炮；
     拉着榴炮往前跑，
     人人看见都叫好，
     把炮拉进阵地内，
     打的碉堡稀巴烂。
    象上面这些枪杆诗，除了个别的错字和句子略加过修改，都保持原状未动。这些写作者，一般都是高小以下的程度，现在，值得注意的是：如何帮助他们提高。因为有些人感到写来写去总是老一套，因之劲头就不如以前大了。要解决这个问题，最好在全国文协里有人专门负责来搜集、整理、出版部队中的快板和枪杆诗，（因为在文学方面来说这是顶受欢迎的东西。）然后再发到部队里，一方面可以把作品推广，另一方面可以使他们看到被修改后底自己的作品，这对创作者本人也是一个很大的帮助。但据我们所知道，目前枪杆诗的发表，只局限于部队的油印报纸上。
