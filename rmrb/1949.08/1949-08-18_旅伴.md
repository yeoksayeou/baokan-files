　　Fellow Traveler
    By Soviet writer Vera Panova, translated by Su Ling, proofread by Cao Jinghua

    Foreword

    "Fellow Traveler" is a work that won the Stalin First Class Prize two years ago. The author, Vera Panova, is a Soviet female writer, born in 1905 in Rostov-on-Don. She studied at a pre-revolutionary higher education institution. In 1922, she began working at the "Labor Don" newspaper. Since then, she has published short articles in various newspapers and magazines. In 1932, she began writing several plays, all of which received good reviews.

    From 1944 to 1945, the author worked on an ambulance train. During this time, she absorbed a lot of valuable material, which she used to write "Fellow Traveler." Following "Fellow Traveler," she wrote "Kruzhilikha."

    This book was translated into English and serialized in the English edition of "Soviet Literature" magazine the year before last. Su Ling translated it from English. However, it was later discovered that the English translation not only had many omissions but also quite a few mistranslations. Therefore, a lot of effort was spent proofreading and supplementing it word by word against the original, resulting in the current translation.

    During my trip to Europe to participate in the World Peace Congress, my personal itinerary originally included a visit to the writer Vera Panova, but due to being particularly busy in Moscow, I couldn't find the time, so this item was canceled. This is something I personally regret very much.

    I will write a special article on the author and "Fellow Traveler" when I have leisure time.

    Part One: Night

    Chapter One: Danilov

    Couldn't sleep. Danilov got up, drew back the thick window curtains, and lowered the window. The window frame slid down silently. Everything in this train was well-equipped and durable. It was satisfying to do anything.

    The wind blew in from the window. The sky and fields were gray and colorless. It was the time of the white nights. It was very quiet.

    This year's summer was late, unlike any other summer. During the day, the sun was very hot, as if in the south, but the nights were very cold. Danilov stood at the window, shivering from the cold. Perhaps he had been standing there for a long time? He didn't know how long.

    He put on his riding breeches and long boots. The plump woman wearing a pleated white nurse's cap brought him thick slippers, telling him to wear them at night. He looked quite good: a pair of tubular riding breeches that hugged his ankles and a pair of thick slippers. How interesting, did she perhaps dress her own husband like this?

    He didn't relax for a moment during these nighttime hours. He put on his cardigan, tightened the cold, creaking leather belt, and picked up his military cap.

    Someone should set an example for the team, damn the commander.

    In the corridor of the commander's car, the wide windows were emitting a gray light. Emptiness, silence, nighttime loneliness. The colorless, bright sky and fields floated backward. Was the commander asleep? Danilov silently pushed open the car door and saw: the commander was half undressed, wearing trousers and socks, sleeping like a child, with his short legs curled up. His hands were clasped together and placed under his chin, as if in prayer.

    The door of the next compartment opened. The staff doctor, Suprunov, wearing a hospital blue robe and thick slippers, came out into the corridor.

    "You're not asleep either, Danilov?"

    "No, I was asleep."

    He lied because he didn't want to have anything in common with Suprunov. If Suprunov couldn't sleep, then he, Danilov, should be asleep. Or vice versa.

    "I've already slept well. But what about you?"

    "You know, I can never sleep. It's probably the unfamiliar environment."

    "Why unfamiliar? We're just taking a train."

    "Where are we taking the train to?" Suprunov chuckled. This chuckle was very annoying. Good people smile, or laugh loudly.

    "We're going to the front lines, Comrade Military Doctor."

    The tall, burly Danilov looked down at Suprunov from a height. "Getting scared, getting scared, doctor. This isn't your consulting room diagnosing patients: take a deep breath. One more time..."

    "We might be in a bad situation, what do you think?"

    "What about it, are we better than others? We might very well be in a bad situation." (To be continued)

    前记
    旅伴，这是前年荣获史大林一等奖金的作品。作者潘诺瓦（Ｖｅｒａ　Ｐａｎｏｖａ）是苏联一位女作家，她于一九○五年生于顿河上的洛斯托夫，曾在革命前的一所高等学校里读书。一九二二年开始在“劳动的顿河”报馆工作。此后即在各报章杂志上发表短文。一九三二年开始陆续写了几个剧本，都得到很好的评价。
    一九四四——四五年，作者在一列救护车上工作，在工作里她吸取了不少宝贵的资料，写了这部作品——旅伴。继旅伴又写了一部克鲁惹夫尼克。
    本书曾译成英文，连载于前年的英文版的苏维埃文学杂志上。由苏龄将它从英文译出。但后来发现英译不但删节很多，而且误译之处也实在不少。乃费了不少工夫，对着原本逐字校补，成了现在的译本。
    此次赴欧参加世界和平大会时，个人访问的日程中，本来预定的有访问作家潘诺瓦一项，后因在莫斯科特别忙碌，挤不出时间来，遂将这项取消了。这在我个人是很可惜的。
    关于作者及旅伴，暇时当专文论述。
  　一九四九年、六月、二十六日。　靖华记于北平
    第一部　夜
    第一章　达尼洛夫
    没有睡着觉。达尼洛夫起来，拉开了厚厚的窗幔，放下窗户。窗框无声的溜下来。这列火车中的一切装备，都是很好而且经久耐用的。无论干起什么事来都是痛快的。
    风从窗子里吹进来。天空和田野都是灰的，没有颜色。是白夜的时候。非常寂静。
    本年的夏天来得很迟，不象任何那一年的夏天。白天太阳非常热，就象在南方似的，可是夜却是很冷的。达尼洛夫站在窗前，挨着冻。或许他站得好久了吗？久不久他不知道。
    他穿上马裤和长靴。这位戴着打褶的白护士帽的胖女人，又把厚拖鞋给他拿来，叫他晚上穿的。样子看起来真不错呵：一条搭起脚踝的管状的马裤和一双厚拖鞋。真有趣，她也许把自己的丈夫打扮成这样儿吗？
    他对这夜的时光是一点儿也不放松的。他穿上对襟小褂，把冰凉的吱吱发响的皮带，好好儿勒了一把，拿起军帽。
    应该有人给队里作一个榜样看，真该死的司令呵。
    司令车的走廊里，宽大的窗子在发着灰色。空虚，寂静，夜间的孤零。无色的，明亮的天空和田野，往后浮动着。司令睡着了吗？达尼洛夫无声的把车门推开，一看：司令半脱了衣服，穿着裤子和短袜，好象孩子似的，拳着短腿睡着了。他的两只手合着，放到下巴上，就好象在祈祷似的。
    隔壁的车门开了。常务医生苏普鲁戈夫穿着医院的蓝色的衣罩和厚拖鞋，出来到走廊里。
    “你也没有睡吗，达尼洛夫？”
    “不，睡过了。”
    他扯谎的，因为他不愿意和苏普鲁戈夫有任何相同的地方。假如苏普鲁戈夫睡不着的话，那么他，达尼洛夫，却应该睡着。或者是正相反。
    “我已经睡好了。可是你呢？”
    “你知道，我总是睡不着。大概是没过惯的环境在作怪呢。”
    “为什么是过不惯的呢？我们不过是乘火车罢了。”
    “我们乘车到哪去呢？”苏普鲁戈夫嬉嬉的笑了一声。他这种嬉嬉的笑声，是很讨厌的。好人都是微笑，或者是高声的大笑。
    “我们到前线去的，军医同志。”
    魁梧的达尼洛夫的高高的身个，居高临下的对苏普鲁戈夫端详着。“胆怯了，胆怯了，医生。这不是在你的诊病室里诊断病人的：深呼吸一下。再来一下……”
    “我们可能陷于穷境呢，你想怎么样？”
    “怎么呢，我们比别人高明些吗？我们很可能陷于穷境呢。”　（未完）
