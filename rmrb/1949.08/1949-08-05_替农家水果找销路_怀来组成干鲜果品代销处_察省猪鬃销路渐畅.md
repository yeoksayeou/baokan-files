    Finding Sales Channels for Farmers' Fruits
    Huailai Establishes a Dried and Fresh Fruit Consignment Center
    Sales Channels for Chahar Province Pig Bristles Gradually Improve
    [Chahar News] Fifty-three villages in the northern and southern mountains of Huailai are abundant in dried and fresh fruits. It is estimated that the annual output of fruits is over 820,000 jin, mountain products such as apricot kernels and walnuts exceed 320,000 jin, and sunflower seeds exceed 1,500,000 jin. These are the main sideline products for most farmers. However, due to the lack of transportation and the fact that fruits are not easy to store for long periods, coupled with farmers' eagerness to sell their fruits for income to purchase necessities, private merchants seize upon this weakness and exploit them greatly. There is a folk saying: "Warehouses! Warehouses! Fruit trees are the parents of the warehouses; carrying fruits to the warehouses brings misery to the tree growers." The extent of merchants' exploitation of farmers can be imagined from this saying. (Warehouses are where fruits are traded.)
    In response to this situation, the Huailai Supply and Marketing Cooperative established a Dried and Fresh Fruit Consignment Center to find sales channels for farmers' fruits. It purchases fruits and mountain products at reasonable prices, helps farmers sell them, and reduces the excessive exploitation by intermediaries. The center has now started operations. A farmer's reception station is attached to the Dried and Fresh Fruit Consignment Center, specializing in solving the accommodation and meal problems of farmers selling fruits. The station opened simultaneously with the consignment center. Farmers warmly welcome this consignment center. (Li Ying)
    [Another News] Since its establishment, the Chahar Provincial Fur Company has been working on purchasing pig bristles, gradually revitalizing the pig bristle market, which had been stagnant for many years. In the past, due to the inability to export, there were no sales channels, and neither new nor old goods could be sold. Since the Provincial Fur Company began operations, it has raised prices to purchase and transport pig bristles to Tianjin for processing and export. In the past six months, it has handled a total of 13,477 jin. Sales channels are gradually improving, and the fur agent shops and fur traders are also becoming more active.

    替农家水果找销路
    怀来组成干鲜果品代销处
    察省猪鬃销路渐畅
    【察哈尔讯】怀来南北山五十三个村盛产干鲜果品，据估计年产水果八十二万余斤，杏仁、核桃等山货三十二万余斤，葵花子一百五十余万斤。为大部农民主要副产品。但由于交通工具缺乏，加上水果不易长期存放，农民又急于拿水果收入购买生活资料，因此每逢水果成熟后，私商便抓住此一弱点，从中大肆剥削，有一民谚：“栈房！栈房！果树是栈房的爹娘；把水果驮到栈房，养树人就遭殃”，（栈房是水果的成交地）商人对农民的剥削程度从谚语里可想而知。
    怀来供销社根据此一情况成立一干鲜果品代销处，替农民水果找销路；并以合理价格收购水果、山货；帮助农民推销，减少中间商人的超额剥削。该处现已开始营业。在干鲜果代销处内附设农民招待栈，专解决出卖水果农民的住宿、吃饭等问题。该栈与代销处同时开张营业。农民对于这一代销处极为欢迎。（李英）
    【又讯】察省省皮毛公司成立以来，即着手经营购买猪鬃，使多年没有出路的猪鬃逐渐活跃起来。过去因不能出口，没有销路，新货不来，旧货也销不出去。自省皮毛公司着手经营以来，提高价格收购并转运天津加工出口。半年来，共经营一三、四七七斤。销路渐畅，并带动了皮毛代理店及皮毛商贩也呈活跃。
