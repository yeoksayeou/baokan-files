    The Heroic Struggle of the Spanish People
    Fernando Claudin, Member of the Political Bureau of the Spanish Communist Party

    Ten years ago, at the end of March 1939, under the pressure of interventionist forces and Franco's rebel army, the Spanish Republic was forced to end its resistance. In the bloodbath of a million dead, hundreds and thousands of new victims were added by Franco's executioners.

    But prisons and massacres cannot destroy the people's will to be free. They will never bow to Franco. Resistance continues. In October 1946, Franco, in a speech in Burgos, had to admit: "We have tried to obtain peace through all actions, but as you know, we have not stopped fighting for a moment in ten years!"

    The defeat of Hitler's Germany gave the people a great impetus to gain liberation quickly and also caused fear and frustration among Franco's agents. But soon people understood that the role of protector of the Franco regime was quickly replaced by another group of figures who, like Hitler, had an interest in maintaining a fascist nest in southwestern Europe.

    Franco's propaganda machine is again clamoring to exterminate the communists—all democrats and republicans are "communists"—in order to gain favor from Washington. US imperialism is doing everything it can to encourage Franco's executioners for its own benefit. US House Representative Shaffer recently said shamelessly during his visit to Spain that substantial aid would be given to Spain to fight communism.

    Franco, with the support of US imperialism and its European running dogs, has repeatedly intensified its reign of terror in recent years to suppress any movement against it.

    At the beginning of 1947, Franco ordered his Internal Guard, a kind of "punitive force" accounting for about a quarter of the entire army, to shoot any "suspicious elements" without warning. Shortly thereafter, its central intelligence agency, the "Central Security Bureau," ordered local police stations: "Do not arrest people at will when there is insufficient evidence, but if the facts are public or used by sole proprietors and enemies, arrests can be made at any time."

    In April 1947, a special criminal law was promulgated stipulating that all activities resisting the Franco regime would be punishable by death.

    This barbaric reign of terror has led to tragic consequences. According to incomplete statistics, from January 1948 to February 1949, eighty people were shot. In addition, according to the order to "shoot without warning," five hundred and seventy-eight anti-fascists, mostly farmers who helped the guerrillas and "suspicious elements," were killed.

    In areas where guerrillas are active, Franco's men act as if they are fighting in enemy countries. They burn forests, expel farmers, and then set villages on fire. They use every means to persecute "hostile elements," disguising the "Internal Guard" as guerrillas, making them ravage the people and commit all kinds of evil in order to destroy the people's—the source of the guerrillas' strength—trust in the guerrillas. In many regional centers, Franco has trained a large number of these disguised elements in order to infiltrate the underground activities of the guerrillas.

    According to the confessions of these captured bandits, many American "experts" are personally leading the training of Franco's agents.

    One hundred and twenty thousand people, including twenty thousand women, are suffering torture and starvation in Franco's prisons. Many suffer from lung disease and receive no medical care. Those arrested and trapped in the Internal Guard concentration camps throughout Spain are subjected to the pain of torture to death. In Madrid, Barcelona, ​​Bilbao, and some other cities, the "new scientific methods" of killing are widely used by Franco's men. The heroic leader of the Spanish Communist Party, Gómez Carreño, said in a secret letter to his wife from Corunna prison before his death: "It is impossible to describe in words how these devils treat me and Seoane. I can only say that—it would be better to die a thousand times than to suffer what we are suffering now! When I left the concentration camp on September 1st, I was only a bag of bones. When I was first arrested, I weighed seventy-three kilograms, but now only forty-eight kilograms. My intestines have rotted in several places, and my lungs are bleeding in several places! I don't know how much effort I used to struggle to pick up this pen to write!" Carreño's suffering is nothing unusual. All anti-fascist fighters, once they fall into Franco's clutches, suffer such a miserable fate.

    This bestial terror is a prominent exposure of the weakness and incompetence of Franco's ruling structure. The reactionary heads understand better than anyone that despite the terror and suppression, the democratic movement is becoming increasingly strong and growing.

    The guerrillas defeated Franco's barbaric "campaigns." They have grown stronger in the struggle, and they have gained strong support among the peasants. The working class is engaging in strikes and reducing production. At the same time, the workers led by the Communist Party are using the official Franco trade unions to fight for their needs.

    Today, criticizing Franco's ruling structure has become the most common form of opposition among the vast majority of the people. The "criticism" that has conquered the terror of arrest is spreading everywhere. It can be heard on the streets, in public places, and in the working-class centers. The reactionary Spanish newspapers cannot hide this fact. American journalists are forced to admit that the vast majority of people have very openly criticized Franco's ruling structure.

    英勇奋战的西班牙人民
    西共政治局委员  费尔南多·克劳丁
    十年前，一九三九年三月底，在干涉者武力和佛朗哥叛军的压力下，西班牙共和国被迫终止了抵抗。在百万个战死者的尸体血泊中，又增加了佛朗哥刽子手屠杀的千百个新牺牲者。
    但是监狱和屠杀不能摧毁人民爱自由的意志。他们决不向佛朗哥低头。抵抗仍在继续。一九四六年十月，佛朗哥在布尔高斯的谈话不得不承认：“吾人企图以一切行动以资获得和平，但正如汝等所知，十年来吾人未曾一刻停止作战！”
    希特勒德国的战败，曾给予人民以迅获解放的伟大鼓舞，也曾使佛朗哥特务分子们恐惧与沮丧。但不久，人们即明白了：佛朗哥机构的庇护者这一角色，迅即被另一组人物所代替，他们和希特勒一样，有兴趣在西南欧保持一个法西斯主义的巢穴。
    佛朗哥宣传机构又在叫嚣灭绝共产党了——所有的民主分子及共和分子都是“共产党”—借以换取华盛顿的恩惠。美帝正为了它自己的利益而用尽一切方法鼓励佛朗哥刽子手。美国众议院代表沙菲尔最近访西时曾无耻地说过，大量援助将给予西班牙与共产主义作战。
    佛朗哥，在获得美帝及其欧洲走狗的支援后，最近几年来一再增强其恐怖统治镇压任何反对它的运动。
    一九四七年初，佛朗哥曾命令其内卫团，约占全军四分之一的一种“讨伐队伍”，对任何“可疑分子”均可无须警告而开枪射击。此后不久，它的中央特务机关，“中央保安局”，即向各地区警局下令：“证据不足时不可随意捕人，然如事实已为公开者或独资敌人利用时则可随时逮捕。”
    一九四七年四月，又有一特刑法公布，一切反抗佛朗哥政权之活动均将处以死刑。
    此一野蛮的恐怖统治已造致了悲惨的结果，根据不完全的统计，一九四八年一月至一九四九年二月，八十人被枪杀，另根据“不加警告而射击”的命令，五百七十八个反法西斯者，大部为援助游击队的农民“可疑分子”，被杀害。
    在游击队活动的地区，佛朗哥部下和在敌国作战一样，他们焚毁森林，他们逐出农民，然后放火烧掉村庄。他们用尽一切方法迫害“敌对分子”，把“内卫团”伪装为游击队，使之蹂躏人民，作恶多端，以破坏人民——游击队力量的泉源——对游击队的信用。在许多地区中心，佛朗哥曾训练了大批这种伪装分子，借以打入游击队的地下组织活动中。
    根据被俘的这些匪徒的口供，美国不少的“专家”正以个人身份领导训练着佛朗哥的特务分子。
    十二万人，其中有二万妇女，正在佛朗哥的监狱中熬煎着非刑与饥饿。许多人为肺病所苦，毫无医药照料。全西班牙那些被捕受困在内卫团集中营的人们，遭受着拷打至死的痛苦。在马德里、巴塞隆那、贝尔波和一些别的城市中，杀人的“科学新法”广泛地为佛朗哥分子使用。英雄的西共领袖高米兹·卡罗索，在他死前从考鲁那狱中秘密写给他妻子的信上说：“这些鬼们怎样对付我和塞奥尼是无法用文字形容的。我只能说是——那怕死一千次也比现在我们所受的痛苦要好得多！当我九月一日离开集中营时，我只剩下一把柴骨了。刚被捕时我重七十三公斤，现在只四十八公斤。我的肠子已数处糜烂，肺也数处出血！我能拿起这一支笔来写字，不知道用了多么大力的挣扎啊！”卡罗索的苦难并无不平常之处，凡是反法西斯战士一旦落入佛朗哥的魔爪，他们的苦难的遭遇都是这样的。
    这种兽性的恐怖是佛朗哥统治机构软弱无能的显著的暴露。反动的头子们比任何人都更明白：尽管恐怖镇压，民主运动却日益坚固与壮大。
    游击队击败了佛朗哥野蛮的“征讨”。他们在斗争中壮大起来，他们在农民中得到了坚强的支持。工人阶级在怠工，缩减生产。同时，共产党所领导的工人们正在利用官方佛朗哥的工会，为他们的需要而斗争。
    今天，批评佛朗哥统治机构，已成为人民群众当中绝大多数最通行的反对形式。征服了恐怖逮捕的“批评”，正蔓延各处。在大街上，在公共场所里，在工人阶级的中心地区都可以听到。西班牙的反动报纸不能够隐藏这个事实。美国的记者们被迫承认：绝大多数人民已十分公开的批评佛朗哥统治机构了。
