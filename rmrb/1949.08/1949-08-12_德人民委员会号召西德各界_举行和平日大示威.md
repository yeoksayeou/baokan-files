Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th: TASS, Berlin: The German People's Committee sent a letter on the 8th to the Prime Ministers of the states of the Western occupation zones of Germany, the Speakers of the state parliaments, the Mayors of various cities, public organizations and people from all walks of life, calling for demonstrations for peace to be held in West Germany on September 1st. The letter declared: The German People's Committee unanimously decided at its eighth meeting to declare September 1st as Peace Day. The German People's Committee made this decision based on the fact that the German people cannot silently pass the tenth anniversary of the evil Hitler's launch of the war on September 1st. In demonstrations across the country, the German people must show their will to demand peace and understanding and friendship with all countries. The German People's Committee calls on the people of the whole country to hold conferences in all towns and places in order to widely develop the German peace movement. To this end, the German People's Committee informs the Prime Ministers, Speakers, Mayors, public organizations and people from all walks of life in the Western occupation zones of Germany, requesting them to do everything possible to make September 1st a great demonstration for peace in Germany in the Western occupation zones as well.
