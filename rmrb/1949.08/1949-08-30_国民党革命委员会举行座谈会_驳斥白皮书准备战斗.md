The Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee Holds Symposium
Refuting the White Paper and Preparing for Battle
[Our Newspaper's News] The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held two symposiums at 9:00 AM on the 24th and 25th to review the American imperialist White Paper. Attendees included Li Jishen, Deng Chumin, Chen Shaoxian, Li Minxin, Zhang＠Wen, Huang Yunshan, Chen Cisheng, Li Shizhang, Peng Xiaofan, Qin Yuanbang, Xu Bao＠, Xie Feng, Feng Zhuwan, Xiao Shuzi, Cao Zhilin, Wu Maosun, Zhang Wen, Yu Xinqing, Tan Pingshan, Cai Tingkai, Li Dequan, He Xiangning, Li Zisong, Lü Jiyi, Tan Dongqing, Chu Shu, and Wang Baozhen. Chairman Li Jishen read out the discussion outline for the symposium, inviting everyone to express their opinions as much as possible to refute the American imperialists and prepare for battle. Ms. He Xiangning refuted the White Paper's distortion and slander of Mr. Sun Yat-sen by quoting Mr. Sun's last words, and emphasized awakening comrades and the people of the country to "dare to fight." Then, Mr. Tan Pingshan spoke, supplementing Ms. He's opinions on the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. He strongly condemned the American imperialists for carrying out conspiracies of discord and division, and believed that the Chinese people would surely be able to shatter their conspiracies. Subsequently, Chen Shaoxian, Wang Baozhen, Zhang Wen, Deng Chumin, Zhang＠Wen, Wu Maosun, Chen Cisheng, Xu Bao＠, Li Minxin, Lü Jiyi, Peng Xiaofan, Tan Dongqing, Xiao Shuzi, Cao Zhilin, Yu Xinqing, Qin Yuanbang, Li Zisong, and others spoke in succession. They all condemned the American imperialists' conspiracy to invade China and their attempt to use so-called "democratic individualism" to divide and provoke, and unanimously advocated improving theoretical understanding, raising vigilance, and educating and persuading those with backward and erroneous ideas in order to shatter the American imperialists' conspiracy. Excerpts from the symposium records are as follows:

Shatter American Imperialist Provocation and Resolutely Take the Soviet Road
	He Xiangning
He Xiangning said: In the chapter "Review of the Relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party" in the American imperialist White Paper, there is an intentional distortion and slander of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's words regarding the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the relationship between China and the Soviet Union, attempting to provoke cooperation between our Revolutionary Committee and the Chinese Communist Party, and to provoke the friendly relations between the Chinese and Soviet people. The declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang clearly opposed imperialism and advocated the restriction of capital and equalization of land ownership. When the Kuomintang was reorganized in 1924, someone asked him: "Aren't you afraid of interference from the great powers and opposition from capitalists by advocating alliance with the Soviet Union and the Communist Party?" He replied frankly: "If I were afraid of the great powers and capitalists, I wouldn't be making a revolution." Furthermore, Mr. Sun's letter to the Soviet Union on his deathbed stated, "I have instructed the Kuomintang to continue to work with you," which fully proves the development of Mr. Sun's thought and proves that his thought was consistently anti-imperialist and pro-Soviet. We are revolutionary followers of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and we will never be fooled by American imperialism or allow American imperialism to slander us. We should awaken our comrades and the people of the country to oppose American imperialist provocation and division.
Here, I would also like to supplement some historical facts about Sino-Soviet friendship: In 1919, Mr. Sun wanted to send Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin, Li Dazhang, and Chiang Kai-shek to the Soviet Union to study, but the plan was not realized due to the death of Zhu Zhixin. Later, the Soviet Union sent Joffe to negotiate with Mr. Sun, abolish the unequal treaties of the Tsarist era, and help us with materials and establish the Whampoa Military Academy. Later, Chiang Kai-shek, this traitor, betrayed the revolution and repaid the Soviet Union with ingratitude. It is regrettable and infuriating. Thirty years ago, I was also a petty bourgeois and had illusions about the old democracy of American capitalism, but due to the influence of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, I felt that the Chinese revolution could only be right by taking the Soviet road. Today, capitalism is becoming more and more decadent, and we have no other way but to learn from the Soviet Union. China has a vast territory and abundant resources. If we want to develop our resources and develop production, we must cooperate with the Soviet Union and rely on Soviet technical personnel. Today, we should not only "discard illusions and prepare for struggle," but also "dare to struggle."

Strengthen Solidarity, Study Marxism-Leninism, and Answer the Conspiracy of the American Imperialist White Paper
	Tan Pingshan
Tan Pingshan said: Regarding the condemnation of the American imperialist White Paper, I have expressed my opinions in the newspapers. Now, regarding the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, I will supplement Ms. He Xiangning's opinions. Everyone says that the White Paper is an admission of American imperialist aggression. Although the American imperialists have confessed to the failure of their aggression against China, they are not reconciled. We should raise our vigilance, unite more closely, and struggle harder to shatter their conspiracy. Now, we will explain the American imperialists' provocation of the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party: Mr. Sun Yat-sen did say that the Principle of People's Livelihood is Communism. Although strictly speaking, the Principle of People's Livelihood is not exactly Communism, Mr. Sun never said anything like "Communism cannot exist in China." Furthermore, he openly acknowledged the open and legal existence of the Communist Party and openly proposed Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. Also, the previous Communist Party's participation in the Kuomintang as individual members for joint cooperation was absolutely open, and it was automatically proposed by Mr. Sun. What conspiracy could there be? The reorganization of the Kuomintang in 1924 was the concretization of the left-wing united front of the National Revolution. If it had not been for the sabotage of British and Japanese imperialism and the betrayal of Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek, the Great Revolution would not have failed.
From Mr. Sun's late-year speeches and actions, we can further prove that Mr. Sun wanted to learn from the Soviet Union. There are countless records of this kind. We will only briefly mention two or three stories that are not recorded in the Kuomintang literature or have been deleted by the reactionaries: In 1924, a memorial service for Lenin was held in Central Park in Guangzhou. Mr. Sun personally wrote the banner with the four characters "Friend and Teacher of the Nation." The so-called "Friend of the Nation" means friend of China, and the so-called "Teacher of the People" means Mr. Sun's own teacher. This shows Mr. Sun's respect and love for Lenin, and it is also Mr. Sun's public expression of learning from the Soviet Union among the broad masses of the people. Also, when resolving the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce incident, Mr. Sun organized a three-person revolutionary committee to preside over the matter, and clearly stated in the hand order: Do not allow Wang Jingwei to participate, saying that Wang Jingwei was against the Soviet Union. Also, when the Central Party Headquarters held a meeting to discuss the issue of the Chamber of Commerce, opposition parties such as Deng Zeru and Zhang Ji were invited to attend. The opposition parties said: The Chamber of Commerce only opposes the Communist Party, not the Kuomintang. If the Communist Party withdraws from the Kuomintang, the Chamber of Commerce can donate weapons to help the Northern Expedition, etc. We know that the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce at that time was under the leadership of British imperialism and was instigated by Chen Lianbo, the compradore of the HSBC Bank, a lackey of British imperialism, to use armed forces to sabotage the left-wing united front of the National Revolution. After listening to the opposition parties' words, Mr. Sun said very solemnly: "If you oppose the Communist Party, I will personally join the Communist Party and fight." This shows Mr. Sun's determination for Kuomintang-Communist cooperation; also, not long after the October Revolution, Mr. Sun sent a telegram to Lenin to congratulate him on his success. Mr. Sun's letter to the Soviet Union before his death all show Mr. Sun's determination to be pro-Soviet and pro-Communist, which further shows the shameless slander of the American imperialist White Paper.
Therefore, today, we should inherit Mr. Sun's legacy, learn from Marxism-Leninism, and learn from Mao Zedong Thought, especially under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its wise leader Chairman Mao, to closely cooperate between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to complete Mr. Sun's legacy. This is the responsibility of us followers of Mr. Sun, and it is also a response to the White Paper.
The White Paper also said: The CCP serves the interests of the Soviet Union, which is not only an insult to the CCP, but also an insult to the Chinese people. Today, the Chinese revolution is a revolutionary movement of the people seeking liberation under the leadership of the Communist Party. The Soviet Union's sympathy for our Chinese revolution is giving us tremendous spiritual encouragement. During the Tsarist era, Mr. Sun also opposed Russia, but after the Russian October Revolution, the Soviet Union became our best friend. Mr. Sun's proposal of a pro-Soviet policy is very natural. Today, we support Chairman Mao's proposal to join the anti-imperialist united front led by the Soviet Union and fight together, which is also very natural. The ugly face of American imperialist aggression against China has been completely exposed, but it is also putting on a hypocritical face, carrying out provocation and division, and implementing a gradual division policy. Many revolutionary friends have spared no effort to expose its true face through verbal criticism and writing, so there is no need to say more, but we believe that our Chinese people will surely be able to shatter its conspiracy.

American Imperialism is the Enemy of the Chinese People It can be Asserted that American Imperialism is Bound to Fail and China is Bound to Win
	Chen Shaoxian
Chen Shaoxian said: Standing on the position of the Revolutionary Committee, we must pay special attention to the places in the White Paper that distort Mr. Sun Yat-sen's doctrine and policies, and severely refute them. The historical facts of Mr. Sun said by the two comrades He Xiangning and Tan Pingshan just now, I can prove are completely correct. Now I only supplement some historical materials. As early as the first year of the Republic of China, Mr. Sun praised socialism as the "sacredness of benefiting the country and benefiting the people," and hoped that "the country of our Republic of China would change into a socialist country." Later, Mr. Sun also praised "Marx as the saint of socialism." After Lenin achieved the socialist revolution in Russia in October 1917, Mr. Sun yearned for the prospect of moving from the Three Principles of the People to socialism and firmly advocated learning from the Soviet system. On the other hand, as early as the period of the Republic of China, Mr. Sun reminded us: "The civilization and happiness of Europe and the United States are always controlled by a few people, becoming an unequal world." Later, he said: "Like the United States, it is a capitalist country. On the surface, it is very rich, but most of the people in the United States still have no happiness to enjoy. Those who enjoy happiness are only a few capitalists." Mr. Sun also criticized the theory of "natural human rights" believed in by Europe and the United States as unreasonable, and advocated that China should implement "revolutionary human rights." He also criticized European and American democracy as false democracy, and advocated that China should implement "direct democracy" and implement a "universal suffrage system." Because of this, we can definitely say that Mr. Sun's ideology, theory, and the three major policies he personally formulated are inclined towards the Soviet Union and against American imperialism. But now American imperialism still wants our country to learn its set of backward democratic methods, which is really absurd!
As for the American imperialist aid to Chiang Kai-shek policy, it is even more an ignorant and cruel crime. In the beginning, if American imperialism had not aided Chiang, Chiang would not have been able to fight the civil war. Chiang lost even more military and popular support because of the civil war, and American imperialism knew this very well, but American imperialism still repeatedly aided Chiang, willingly being the enemy of the Chinese people, making the Chinese people hate American imperialism as much as they hate the traitor Chiang. Now, American imperialism is obsessed with its own ideas and still wants to interfere in China's internal affairs and encourage internal chaos in China. If American imperialism does this, we can assert that American imperialism is bound to fail and China is bound to win. But we must also raise our vigilance.

　　国民党革命委员会举行座谈会
  　驳斥白皮书准备战斗
    【本报讯】中国国民党革命委员会于二十四、二十五两日的上午九时，举行过两次检讨美帝白皮书的座谈会，出席者有李济深、邓初民、陈劭先、李民欣、张＠文、黄云山、陈此生、李世璋、彭晓帆、秦元邦、许宝＠、谢丰、冯祝万、萧树滋、曹志麟、吴茂荪、张文、余心清、谭平山、蔡廷锴、李德全、何香凝、李子诵、吕集义、谭冬菁、褚曙、王葆真，主席李济深，宣读座谈会讨论提纲，请大家尽量发表意见，驳斥美帝并准备战斗。何香凝先生就白皮书对孙中山先生的曲解与污蔑一点，引述孙先生遗言，加以驳斥。并强调唤醒同志，唤醒国人“放胆斗争”。继而谭平山先生发言，就国共关系补充何先生的意见，对于美帝进行挑拨离间，以遂行分化的阴谋，痛加斥责，并相信中国人民一定能够粉碎其阴谋的。其后相继发言的，有陈劭先、王葆真、张文、邓初民、张＠文、吴茂荪、陈此生、许宝＠、李民欣、吕集义、彭晓帆、谭冬菁、萧树滋、曹志麟、余心清、秦元邦、李子诵等。均对美帝侵华阴谋，企图以所谓“民主个人主义”来分化挑拨，加以谴斥，并一致主张提高理论认识，提高警惕，教育说服思想落后错误分子，以粉碎美帝阴谋。兹摘录座谈会纪录如次：
　　粉碎美帝挑拨坚决走苏联的路
  　何香凝
    何香凝说：美帝白皮书在“国共关系之检讨”的一章里，对于国共关系与中苏关系，有意曲解孙中山先生的话，并加以污蔑，企图挑拨我们革命委员会与中共的合作，挑拨中苏人民的友好关系。国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言就很显明的反对帝国主义，主张节制资本，平均地权。当民十三年国民党改组的时候，曾经有人问他：你主张联苏联共，不怕列强干涉，资本家反对吗？他率直的答道：如果我怕列强，怕资本家就不革命了。又中山先生临终时致苏联的遗书，曾有“我已命国民党长此继续与你们提携”的话，这就充分证明孙先生思想的发展；证明它的思想是一贯的反帝亲苏。我们是中山先生的革命信徒，我们决不上美帝的当，听任美帝的污蔑。我们应该唤起同志，唤起国人，反对美帝的挑拨离间。
    这里我还要补充一些中苏友好的史实：民国八年，孙先生便想派廖仲恺、朱执信、李达章、蒋介石四人到苏联学习，旋以朱执信死难未果。其后，苏联派越飞与孙先生谈判，取消沙皇时代的不平等条约，并助我物资，助我创办黄埔军校。后来蒋介石这个叛徒反叛革命，对苏联以怨报德。至可痛愤。三十年前，我也是个小资产阶级，对美国资本主义的旧民主也有这幻想，但由于孙中山先生的影响，我感到中国革命只有走苏联的路才对。今天资本主义更日趋没落了，我们除向苏联学习无他途。中国地大物博，蕴藏丰富，我们要开展富藏，发展生产，更非与苏联提携，借重苏联技术人才不可。我们今天不仅要“丢掉幻想，准备斗争”，更应“放胆斗争”。
    加强团结学习马列主义答复美帝白皮书的阴谋
  　谭平山
    谭平山说：关于斥责美帝白皮书，我曾在报上发表意见。现在就国共关系，补充何香凝同志的意见。大家都说，白皮书，是美帝侵略的供状，美帝虽自供侵华的失败，但他并不死心，我们应提高警惕，更加团结，更加奋斗，粉碎它的阴谋。我们现在就美帝挑拨国共关系，加以说明：孙中山先生的确说过民生主义就是共产主义，虽然严格说来，民生主义并不就是共产主义，但中山先生从来没说过“共产主义不能在中国存在”这类的话。且公开承认共产党公开合法存在，公开提出国共合作。又中山先生没有反对过阶级斗争，本党十三年改组宣言中，主张各革命阶级联合反对帝国主义和军阀，正说明当时中山先生是国民革命左翼统一战线的组织者。是进行着与反革命阶级的一种剧烈的阶级斗争。
    中共是马列主义的党，它的终极目的，是实现马列主义，这是中共屡次公开声明的。又以前共产党以个别党员参加国民党，共同合作，当时是绝对公开的，而且是由中山先生自动提出的。有什么阴谋之可言？十三年国民党的改组，是国民革命左翼统一的具体化，如果以后不是英日等帝国主义的破坏，不是汪精卫蒋介石等叛变，大革命是不会失败的。
    我们从中山先生晚年的言论与行动，更足证明中山先生是要学习苏联的。关于这类的记载，不胜缕举，我们只从国民党文献所未记载或被反动派所删除的二三故事略为说说：民国十三年在广州中央公园举行追悼列宁大会，中山先生亲题横额：“国友人师”四字。所谓“国友”，就是中国的友人，所谓“人师”，就是中山先生自己的老师的意思，可见中山先生对列宁的敬爱，也是中山先生在广大的人民中公开向苏联学习的表示。又当解决广州商团之役，中山先生曾组织三人的革命委员会主持其事，手令中明白说：不要汪精卫参加，说汪精卫是反对苏联的。又当中央党部开会讨论商团问题时，当时邓泽如张继等反对派都被邀列席。反对派说：商团只反对共产党，不反对国民党，如共产党退出国民党，商团可以捐出枪械，帮助北伐等语。我们知道当时的广州商团，是在英帝国主义领导之下，经过英帝国走狗汇丰银行买办陈廉伯的主使，以武装力量破坏国民革命左翼统一战线的。中山先生听了反对派的话之后，很严正的说：“你们反对共产党，我个人加入共产党奋斗好了，”这是说明中山先生对于国共合作的坚决；又在十月革命不久，中山先生致电列宁祝其成功，在中山先生逝世前，致苏联的遗书，这都足以表示中山先生亲苏联共的决心，更可说明美帝白皮书的无耻污蔑。
    所以我们在今日，应该继承中山先生的遗教，向马列主义学习，向毛泽东思想学习，尤其是在中国共产党和其英明领袖毛主席领导之下，国共密切合作，完成中山先生的遗志，这是我们中山先生信徒的责任，也是对于白皮书的一种答复。
    白皮书又说：中共为苏联利益而服务，这不仅侮辱中共，而且侮辱中国人民。今天中国革命，是在共产党领导之下的人民自求解放的革命运动，苏联同情我们中国革命，是给我们以莫大的精神鼓励。沙皇时代，中山先生也曾反俄，但俄国十月革命以后，苏联成了我们最好朋友，中山先生亲苏政策的提出，这是很自然的，我们今天拥护毛主席所提出加入以苏联为首的反帝统一战线，共同奋斗，这也是很自然的，美帝侵略中国的狰狞面目业已毕露，但又装出伪善怪脸，进行挑拨离间，以逐行分化政策，许多革命朋友不惜口诛笔伐，暴露其真面目了，不必多说了，但我们相信我们中国人民一定能够粉碎其阴谋的。
    美帝与中国人民为敌可以断言美帝必败中国必胜
  　陈劭先
    陈劭先说：我们站在革命委员会的立场，对于白皮书里面有关曲解孙中山先生的主义政策之处，尤须特别研讨，加以严厉的驳斥。刚才何香凝、谭平山两同志所说孙先生的历史事实，我可证明是完全正确的。现在我只补充说些史料。早在民国元年，孙先生对于社会主义，即称赞其为“利国福民之神圣”，并希望“我中华民国之国家，一变而为社会主义之国家”。后来，孙先生又称赞“马克思是社会主义的圣人”。一九一七年十月列宁在俄国成就了社会主义革命后，孙先生更憧憬由三民主义走上社会主义的前途。并且坚决地主张学习苏联的制度。另一方面，早在民元时期，孙先生即提示我们：“欧美的文明幸福，总由少数人把持，成为不平等的世界”。后来，又说：“象美国，本是资本主义的国家，表面是很富庶的，但是美国大多数的人民，还是毫无幸福可享，那些享幸福的，只是少数的资本家”。孙先生又批评欧美所信仰的“天赋人权”的学说为不合理，而主张中国应实行“革命人权”。又批评欧美的民主为虚伪的民主，而主张中国应实行“直接民权”，实行“普选制度”。因为这样，我们可以肯定的说，孙先生的思想理论及其亲自订定的三大政策，是倾向苏联，反对美帝的。可是现在美帝却还要我国学它那一套落后的民主方式，真是荒谬绝伦！
    至于美帝的援蒋政策，更是一种愚昧和残忍的罪行，当初，美帝如不援蒋，蒋就不能打内战，蒋因打内战而更加丧失军心民心，美帝亦明知之，但美帝依然再三援蒋，甘心与中国人民为敌，使得中国人民痛恨美帝，犹如痛恨蒋贼一样。现在美帝执迷不悟，还想干涉中国内政；鼓励中国内乱，美帝如果这样做去，我们可以断言，美帝必败，中国必胜。但是我们也不能不提高我们的警惕。
    （未完）
