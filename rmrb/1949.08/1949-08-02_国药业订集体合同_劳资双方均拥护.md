    National Pharmaceutical Industry Signs Collective Contract
    Labor and Management Both Support
    [Our Newspaper] After the signing and publication of the collective contract for labor and management in the Beiping national pharmaceutical industry, it has been universally supported by both labor and management throughout the city's national pharmaceutical industry. Both sides believe that the contract's content is the most reasonable. As long as labor and management both implement it precisely, major disputes will not occur again in the future, and both sides can only benefit and develop production by following this contract. Qiao Hongdong, a worker at the Tongji Pharmacy in Beixinqiao who has worked in the national medicine industry for eleven years, said: "This contract is very reasonable and legal. This is truly mutually beneficial for labor and management. If workers don't work hard and demand too much, the business will collapse, and they will lose their jobs. If the capitalists continue to oppress the workers, the business will not do well either. Only by acting in accordance with the labor-management mutual benefit contract can we develop production."
    Lai Wenbin, a shop assistant at Qianzhizhitang, said: "In the past, the national pharmaceutical industry almost always had contracts. In name, they were signed by both parties, but they only benefited the capitalists. In the past, national pharmaceutical industry workers did not have fixed working hours, but now they are stipulated. It is also stipulated that the capitalists cannot dismiss workers without reason, and cultural education for workers must also be resolved within possible means. At the same time, shop rules are also stipulated. This contract is formulated based on the principle of developing production and benefiting both labor and management, and not just benefiting one side."
    Li Shantang, the shopkeeper of Qianzhizhitang, said: "We in the national pharmaceutical industry started discussing the contract two months ago. There were a total of twenty or thirty discussions, and the twenty-four articles of the contract truly represent the interests of both parties."
    Some labor and management, although they both support this contract, still hold attitudes of mutual distrust and suspicion towards each other because of the deep-seated hatred and antagonism of the past. They suspect that the other party may not fulfill the conditions of the contract and whether new problems may arise in details such as meals, bonuses, and year-end rewards. For example, both the workers and the owner of Beiqingrentang, which once had a labor-management dispute, are worried that disputes may arise when discussing the details. This is mainly due to mutual distrust between the two sides. In fact, both sides are willing to solve the problem in accordance with the spirit of the contract and believe that the government has the power to make both parties abide by the collective contract signed by their representatives.

### 国药业订集体合同  劳资双方均拥护

    国药业订集体合同
    劳资双方均拥护
    【本报讯】北平国药业劳资集体合同签订发表以后，获得全市国药业劳资双方的普遍拥护，都认为合同内容是最合理的，只要劳资双方都确切根据这项合同解决问题，以后将不致再发生大的纠纷，而且双方只有依照这项合同做，才能劳资两利，才能发展生产。北新桥的同济药栈一个在国药行干过十一年的工人乔洪栋说：“这个合同非常合理合法，这才真正是劳资两利，假如工人不好好干活，要求太高了，把买卖搞垮，就要失业；假如资方仍压迫工人，买卖也好不了，只有根据签订的劳资两利的合同办事，才能发展生产。”
    千芝堂店员赖文彬说：“过去国药业差不多都有合同，名义上是双方签定，但只对资方有利。过去国药业工人没有一定的工作时间，现在规定了；又规定资方不能无故解雇工人，工人文化教育也规定要在可能范围内解决，同时又规定了要有铺规。这合同是根据发展生产劳资两利制定的，而不是只对一方有利。”
    千芝堂掌柜李善堂说：“我们国药业的合同，两月前资方就开始讨论，讨论共有二、三十次，合同二十四条真正代表了双方的利益。”
    也有一些劳方和资方虽然都拥护这项合同，不过因过去仇视、对立太深了，现在仍抱着互不信任的态度，互相猜疑对方可能不履行合同上的条件，是否可能在伙食、花红和年节犒劳等细节上再生枝节。如曾一度闹过劳资纠纷的北庆仁堂工人和铺东都担心在商量细节时可能起纠纷，这主要原因是双方的互不信任，实际上双方都愿根据合同的精神解决问题，而且都相信政府有力量使双方遵守双方代表签订的集体合同。
