　　North China People's Government Ministry of Agriculture
  　Forms Forest and Animal Husbandry Survey Team
    Invites Experts to Study Chabei and Suidong
    [Report from this newspaper] The Ministry of Agriculture of the North China People's Government is organizing a forest and animal husbandry survey team to study the establishment of windbreak forest belts and the development of animal husbandry in Chabei and Suidong. Twenty experts, professors, researchers, and teaching assistants from Peking University, Tsinghua University, the Beiping Research Institute, the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, and other institutions have been invited to participate in the two survey teams. The forest survey team has invited an especially wide range of personnel, including talent in forestry, plant ecology, meteorology, geology, soil, water and soil conservation, agronomy, and animal husbandry.
    Before the trip, the survey team held two discussion meetings, and invited nationally renowned forestry expert Liang Xi, Lin @, botany expert Hu Xian @ and other gentlemen to participate and provide guidance. At the meeting, Mr. Liang Xi believed that the old society never paid attention to construction, which resulted in technical skills having nowhere to be used. Today, while the War of Liberation is still going on, the People's Government is already paying attention to construction in various aspects, especially initiating large-scale forest construction. This is an exciting thing. Finally, he raised the issue of paying attention to the study of tree species and mobilizing the masses to plant trees. Mr. Lin @ also encouraged everyone to treat various scientific and technological skills as a lifelong career in the future. The two survey teams are ready and decided to depart on the 20th of this month. The survey route starts from Dolun in the east, passes through Baoyuan, Kangbao, Dehua, and reaches Shangdu, then extends to the eight counties of Xinghe, Jining, and Taolin in Suidong. The journey is about a thousand miles. The entire survey will take about two months.
    Chabei and Suidong are both extremely vast high plain areas with cold climates and dry air. Natural disasters have been severe throughout the years, but they are also relatively developed areas for animal husbandry in China. The annual wind and sand hazards have a great impact on local animal husbandry and agriculture in inland North China, which urgently needs to be overcome and improved. The current survey work seems to be aimed at solving the problems of Chahar and Suiyuan, but it will extend to Jehol, Gansu, and Ningxia as the situation develops. Therefore, this survey work is arduous and great, something that the reactionary governments of the past were unwilling and unable to do. At the same time, this survey work will play a certain role in the development of natural science and the connection between theory and practice.

　　华北人民政府农业部
  　组森林畜牧调查团
    邀请专家赴察北绥东研究
    【本报讯】华北人民政府农业部正组织森林畜牧调查团去察北、绥东研究建立防风林带和发展畜牧业问题。应邀参加该两调查团的人员有北大、清华、北平研究院、华北农业科学研究所等单位的专家、教授、研究员、助教等二十人。尤以森林调查团邀请人员更为广泛，包含有森林、植物生态、气象、地质、土壤、水土保持、农艺、畜牧等方面的人材。
    该调查团在行前曾召集两次座谈会，并请全国知名的森林专家梁希、林＠，植物学专家胡先＠等先生参加指导。会上梁希先生认为旧社会一向不重视建设，所以造成了有技术没处用；今天解放战争还在进行的时候，人民政府却已重视各方面的建设，特别是发动大的森林建设，这件事是值得兴奋的。最后并提出注意研究树种及发动群众植树等问题。林＠先生又勉励大家今后把各种科学技术当成终身事业去做。该两调查团已准备就绪，决定于本月二十日出发。调查路线东起多伦，经宝源、康保、德化，至商都再延至绥东的兴和、集宁、陶林等八县。行程约千里。全部调查时间约需两个月。
    察北、绥东，都是极广阔的高平原地区，气候寒冷，空气干燥，历年天灾严重；但又是中国畜牧业比较发达的地区。每年风沙为害对于当地的畜牧业和华北内地的农业影响都很大，急需加以克服和改良。这一调查工作目前看来是为解决察、绥的问题，但会随形势的发展而至热河、甘肃、宁夏。因之这一调查工作是艰巨而伟大的工作，为历代反动政府所不愿做和做不到的事情；同时这一调查工作对自然科学的发展，理论与实际的联系上会起它一定的作用。（农业部林牧处）
