　　North Ping Xinhua Broadcasting Station broadcast on the 20th: Shanghai News: The CCP Central Committee East China Bureau and the CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee jointly sent a telegram on the 19th to all commanders and fighters, working comrades, and all militiamen and laborers marching south to Fujian, celebrating their great victory in liberating Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian Province. The telegram stated: "The liberation of Fuzhou deprives the Kuomintang remnant bandits' last desperate nest and its naval and air base in Taiwan, which is conducting a criminal blockade against us, of its outer defenses, completely exposing it to the advancing spearhead of our Liberation Army. This will greatly benefit our final annihilation of the enemy, liberate the whole country, and completely crush the enemy's naval and air blockade. This is a tremendous encouragement to the people of East China and Shanghai, who are currently engaged in an intense anti-blockade struggle. We hope with excitement that you will continue your efforts, quickly clear out the remaining enemies in Fujian Province, and step up the preparations for the advance on Taiwan. Fight to completely eliminate the enemy's last nest and liberate Taiwan!"

　　中共中央华东局暨上海市委会
  　电贺解放福州大捷
    【北平新华广播电台二十日广播】上海消息：中共中央华东局和中共上海市委会，特在十九日联合致电南征福建的全体指战员同志、工作同志和全体民工民兵同志，庆祝他们解放福建省会福州的伟大胜利。电报中说：“福州的解放，使国民党残余匪帮最后挣扎的巢穴及其对我进行罪恶封锁的海空基地台湾失去外围屏障，完全暴露在我解放大军的进军矛头之前。这将大大有利于我们最后消灭敌人，解放全国和彻底粉碎敌人的海空封锁。这对于目前正在紧张的进行反封锁斗争的全华东和全上海的人民，是一个极大的鼓励。我们以兴奋的心情，希望你们再接再厉，迅速扫清福建全省残敌，加紧完成进军台湾的各项准备工作。为彻底消灭敌人的最后巢穴，解放台湾而斗争！”
