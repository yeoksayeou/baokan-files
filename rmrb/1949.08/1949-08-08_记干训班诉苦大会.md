    A thunderous applause welcomed us to the square of the cadre training class. It was filled with strong, healthy worker comrades. Clearly, their lives were full of vitality. They wanted us to sing, so we sang "Workers Have Power." Our singing was more powerful than ever. They flashed their eyes, happily and with a hint of pride. Then they sang "Unity is Strength," and we joined them, our voices merging into a strong torrent.

    The meeting began. This was a grievance meeting for the worker comrades. The expression and tone of the first comrade to speak immediately made the atmosphere of the meeting serious and heavy. She recalled the past life of being worse than animals. For fear of being "grabbed for forced labor," and for having offended the police, they dared not go home day and night. Her father fled and his whereabouts were unknown. "We were not even as good as dogs; dogs could at least go home and wander around." The pain was contagious, infecting the crowd. Her eyes were moist, and who could keep their eyes dry? How many people haven't personally suffered from the atrocities of Chiang Kai-shek? But this pain was quickly overwhelmed by the second comrade's rough words: "Comrades, I want to talk about our struggle with the reactionaries!" He was a worker at the Shanghai Puppet Central Printing Factory. He recounted the past uncompromising struggles such as strikes and petitions. "In order to fight for the cost of living index, we launched a hunger strike. The reactionaries busily printed banknotes and forced us to work. We refused to eat. If we didn't eat, we wouldn't have the strength. Let's see if you can force us! We starved for thirty-six hours. Our faces turned pale, and our eyes were sunken. The weaker comrades gradually collapsed. We just fell down inside the factory. The reactionaries used soft words to coax us, buying bread and urging us to eat. We drove them away with curses! Then they called the police to forcibly drag us out. Comrades, at that time, everyone cried, not for themselves, but for our entire working class suffering oppression. Why should we suffer such inhumane treatment? Seeing our half-dead comrades being kicked and yelled at by those lackeys, our hearts were cut like knives. Our families organized 'husband-seeking and son-seeking groups' to surround the factory, crying and scolding. The howls from inside and outside echoed each other, it was simply a dark and bleak scene. But the factory owners would not have mercy on us. The only thing they wanted was to drag us out of the machine room dead or alive, and they would not be responsible for our life or death. So, were workers destined to be bullied? No! Comrades, our strength came! At this time, more than seventy factories and units in Shanghai knew about our hunger strike and immediately sent representatives to contact us. When they saw the factory owners' atrocities, they immediately held an emergency meeting, protested to the authorities, and declared that if our demands were not met within two hours, the workers of more than seventy units in Shanghai (including electricity, water, trams, etc.) would immediately turn Shanghai into a dark world, without light, water, or transportation. This scared them, so they had to agree to our demands. Comrades, only workers can help workers. Where is there any Bodhisattva or savior? The capitalists' philanthropy will never reach the workers!" His words ended in enthusiastic applause. Then two more worker comrades recounted how they were oppressed by the landlords. Unable to survive, they went to the factories, only to be subjected to even more cruel exploitation. …

    In this meeting, I received a great education. This was a vivid education. First of all, I gained a deeper understanding of the working class liberating themselves. The working people were not waiting to be liberated. Under the leadership of the underground party, they carried out heroic struggles, shaking the reactionaries to their core, and laying a good foundation for the people's own army. Secondly, I clearly understood what we should learn from our worker brothers. I deeply understood the working class's fighting spirit, organization, discipline, and class solidarity. They are fundamentally an indivisible whole. Apart from collective interests, there are no individual interests. Without organization and discipline, there is no victory. Precisely because they are so closely connected, sharing life and death, they have the most sincere human emotion—class solidarity. Thirdly, through the painful process of peasants becoming workers, I more concretely understood what the primitive accumulation of capital is. The exploiters use this most despicable means to trample on the bodies of the working people, shamelessly plundering the fruits of labor.

    记干训班诉苦大会
    周盼
    一阵春雷似的掌声把我们迎到干训班的广场，那里满坐着壮健的工人同志们，显然他们的生活充满着活力，他们要我们唱歌，我们就高唱“咱们工人有力量”，我们的歌声比任何时候都更加雄壮；他们愉快而略带几分骄傲地闪着眼睛，接着，他们唱起了“团结就是力量”，我们和着他们，歌声汇成一股坚强的洪流。
    开会了，这是工人同志们的诉苦大会，第一位诉苦同志的表情和语调，立刻使会场情绪变得严肃，沉重，她回忆着过去牛马不如的生活，为了怕“抓劳工”，为了得罪过警察，他们日夜不敢回家，父亲逃亡不知下落，“咱们连狗也不如，狗还可以回家转几转”，痛切传染着人群，她的眼睛润湿了，又有谁的眼睛能不润湿？蒋匪暴行，不身受其苦的，能有几个？但这种痛切很快，就很快被第二位同志粗壮的语句所淹没：“同志们，我要来说一说我们和反动派的斗争”，他是上海伪中央印制厂的工人，他叙述着过去罢工请愿等不屈不挠底斗争，“为了争取生活指数，我们发动了绝食罢工，反动派忙印钞票，强制我们做活，我们就不吃饭，不吃饭就没力气，看你强制得来强制不来？我们饿到卅六个小时，脸色变得铁青，眼睛也凹了下去，体弱的同志们逐渐倒下了，我们就倒在工厂里面，反动派用软话来诳哄我们，买了面包劝我们吃，我们连呻带骂地把他们赶跑啦！于是他们叫了警察，要把我们硬架出去。同志们，那时候，每一个人都哭了，不是为自己哭，而是为咱们整个工人阶级受着压迫，我们为什么要受这种惨无人道的待遇？看着饿得半死的伙伴们，被那些狗腿踢打吆喝，心里就如刀割一般难受。我们的家属组织了索夫索儿团，围着厂子哭骂，里外的嚎声相应和，简直惨无天日，但是厂家不会怜悯我们，他唯一想得到的，就是把我们死拉活扯地架出机器房，死活他好不负责任。那么工人就只有受欺压的命吗？不！同志们，我们的力量来了，这时候上海七十多个工厂单位，知道了我们绝食的消息，立刻派代表来与我们联络，他们看见厂家的那种暴行，马上开紧急会议，向当局提出抗议，宣称在两小时内，若不答应我们的要求，上海七十多个单位（包括电灯、自来水、电车等）工人就要使上海立刻变成一个黑暗世界，没有光，没有水，没有交通。这一来，他们可吓慌了，只好答应我们的要求。同志们，替工人帮忙的，只有工人，哪有什么菩萨救世主？资本家博爱，是爱不到工人头上来的！”他的话在热烈的掌声中结束了，接着又有两位工友叙述他们如何受地主的压迫，实在活不下去，才走入工厂，到工厂后，又受到更惨酷的剥削。…
    这次大会中，我受的教育太大了，这是活生生的教育，首先，我对工人阶级自己解放自己的观点有了更深刻的认识，劳动人民不是等着被解放，他们在地下党的领导下，进行了英勇斗争，震动了反动派的内脏，替人民自己的军队做了良好的奠基工作。第二、我明确地理解到，我们要向工人弟兄们学习什么？我深深地懂得了工人阶级的斗争性、组织性、纪律性和阶级友爱，他们根本是一个不可分割的整体，除了集体利益，再没有什么个人利益；没有组织，没有纪律就没有胜利。正因为他们是如此息息相关，同生共死，所以他们才能有人间最真挚的感情——阶级友爱。第三、由于农民转变为工人的苦难过程，我更具体地认识到什么是资本的原始积蓄？剥削者就是用这种最卑劣的手段，从劳动人民的身体上，践踏过去，无耻地掠夺了劳动的果实。
