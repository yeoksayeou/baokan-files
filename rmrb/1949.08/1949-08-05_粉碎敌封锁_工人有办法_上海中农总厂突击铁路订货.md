    Smash the Enemy Blockade
    Workers Have a Way
    Shanghai China Agricultural Machinery General Factory Rushes Railway Orders
    [Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station, 4th Broadcast] The China Agricultural Machinery Corporation General Factory is enthusiastically engaged in crash production, having established a night raid team. Since accepting a railway order on July 13th for 100,000 railroad spikes and 15,000 sets of screws, the factory, after half a month of preparation, successfully test-ran production on July 31st and officially started work on August 1st. Participating in this work are workers, staff, as well as Jiaotong University staff and dozens of Tongji University students who are interning at the factory. Everyone believes that this crash production has significant implications for smashing the enemy's blockade and developing inland transportation. They are working enthusiastically in the high temperature of over 100 degrees, sweating profusely. One worker said that because making railroad spikes was a first for the factory, they only made 570 spikes on the trial run on the 31st, but on the third day they were able to make 5,650 spikes. By the 3rd, they had already made 10,000 spikes. After inspection, the quality was not low. He said: In order to smash the enemy's blockade and build our own railway, the workers of the China Agricultural Machinery General Factory have a way!

    粉碎敌封锁
    工人有办法
    上海中农总厂突击铁路订货
    【上海人民广播电台四日广播】中国农业机械公司总厂热烈展开突击生产成立夜袭队。该厂自七月十三日接受铁路订货道钉十万只，螺丝一万五千付以来，经过半个月的准备，七月三十一日试车成功，八月一日正式开工，参加这一工作的有工人职员还有到厂实习的交大职员和同济的几十位同学。大家认为这次突击生产，是有着粉碎敌人封锁发展内地交通的重大意义。他们在一百多度的室内高温中，流着汗热烈地工作。一位工人说，因为做道钉在该厂还是第一次，在三十一日试工时，一天只作五百七十只，第三天就能做出五千六百五十支，三日已经做到一万支了，经过检验合格，质量并不低。他说：为了粉碎敌人封锁，建造自己的铁路，我们中农总厂工人是有办法的。
