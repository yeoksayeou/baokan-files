Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 20th: In order to smash the blockade by the imperialist Kuomintang reactionaries, enterprises and government offices in Shanghai and Hangzhou are actively seeking ways to solve the fuel problem, and have achieved preliminary results. Shanghai China Vegetable Oil Company, based on its experience in mass-producing gasoline from vegetable oil in Hengyang, Guizhou, and other places during the War of Resistance Against Japan, began manufacturing gasoline, diesel, and kerosene in mid-July. The company first experimented with cottonseed oil foots, and the results showed that every 100 jin of cottonseed oil foots can produce 8 jin of gasoline and 16 jin of diesel. The remaining materials can also be used to make kerosene and lubricating oil. The product quality is very good, with every 100 jin of gasoline equivalent to 90 jin of American gasoline, and every 100 jin of diesel equivalent to 95 jin of American diesel. If cottonseed oil or rapeseed oil is used for manufacturing, the output will be even higher. Shanghai Far East Engineering Company has also successfully trial-produced a fuel-saving device. This fuel-saving device is entirely made of domestic materials. After testing by the Logistics Department of the East China Military Region and a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Third Field Army, it can save 15.9 percent of gasoline. Major transportation companies in the city have already partially adopted it. In order to study methods of saving gasoline, the Hangzhou Industrial Department specially invited relevant experts to a forum at the beginning of the month, and appointed six people, including Zhejiang University professors Li Shouheng and Wang Baoren, and Zhang Liwen, manager of the Zhedong Vegetable Oil Factory, to form a research group responsible for carrying out research work. The Industrial Department also encouraged the production of alcohol on the condition that it does not deplete grain, such as using the materials left over from sugar factories in Jinhua, Yiwu, Lanxi and other areas for brewing. At the same time, efforts will be made to improve the modification of charcoal vehicles.

Furthermore, the fertilizers used by farmers in Zhejiang have always relied on foreign chemical products, such as sulfuric acid and fertilizer powder. In addition to deciding to hire experts to study the manufacture of inorganic chemical fertilizers, the Hangzhou Industrial Department is also encouraging the use of natural organic fertilizers, such as cottonseed cake and rapeseed cake produced locally, which contain a lot of nitrogen and phosphorus and can be used as fertilizers in large quantities.

　　用植物油炼汽油
  　沪杭等地解决燃料困难
    【新华社上海二十日电】为粉碎帝国主义国民党反动派的封锁，上海和杭州的各企业机关正积极设法解决燃料问题，并已获得初步成绩。上海中国植物油料公司，根据抗战期间在衡阳、贵州等地以植物油大量制造汽油的经验，于七月中旬着手制造汽油、柴油和火油。该公司首先以棉油脚试验，结果每百斤棉油脚可产汽油八斤和柴油十六斤，所余材料还可制火油和机油。产品质量甚佳，每百斤汽油相当于美国汽油九十斤，每百斤柴油相当于美国柴油九十五斤。如采用棉油或菜油制造，产量当更高。上海远东工程公司试制节油器亦已获得成功。该节油器全部用国产材料制造，经华东区后勤部和人民解放军第三野战军某部试验结果，能节省汽油百分之十五点九。现市内各大交通运输公司已部分采用。杭州市工业部为研究节约汽油方法，特于月初邀请有关专家座谈，并推定浙江大学教授李寿恒、王葆仁、浙东植物油厂经理张理文等六人组织研究小组，负责进行研究工作。工业部并鼓励在不损耗粮食的条件下进行酒精生产，如利用金华、义乌、兰溪一带制糖所余之材料酿造等。同时提高改装木炭汽车。
    又讯：浙江一般农民所用肥料一向仰给外国之化学药品，如硫酸＠、肥田粉等。现杭州工业部除决定聘请专家研究无机化学肥料之制造外，并鼓励采用天然之有机肥料，如本地所产之棉饼、菜饼等含氮质磷质很多，可大量用作肥料。
