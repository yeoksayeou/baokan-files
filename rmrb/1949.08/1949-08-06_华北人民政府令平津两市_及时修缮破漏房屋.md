    The North China People's Government Orders Tianjin and Beijing to
    Promptly Repair Leaking and Dilapidated Houses
    [Ping City News] Recently, continuous heavy rain has caused widespread erosion and leakage in houses. The North China People's Government has therefore ordered the Tianjin and Beijing Municipal Governments to instruct their respective land administration bureaus, public and reverse property liquidation bureaus, and civil affairs bureaus to send personnel to thoroughly inspect all publicly owned houses. Any leaks should be promptly repaired by the agencies, organizations, or individuals occupying the houses to prevent collapse. Furthermore, the Forbidden City, temples, and uninhabited temples that have leaks must also be repaired promptly to protect state property.
