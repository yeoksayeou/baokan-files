　　Creating Prerequisites for Industrial Development
  　Economic Conference of Chahar Province
  　Emphasizes Orientation Towards Rural Areas
    Over the Next Year, It Will Be Necessary to Export 600 Million Jin of Surplus Grain
    [Reported by this newspaper] The first economic conference of Chahar Province victoriously concluded on the 11th of this month. Through group discussions, thematic reports, and speeches at the general assembly, Chairman Zhang Su of the provincial government delivered the concluding remarks. Throughout the nine-day agenda, the conference consistently embodied the spirit: in order to develop industrial production, it is essential to first orient towards the countryside and restore and develop agricultural production; to become prosperous, one must first rely on agriculture. The conference pointed out that developing industrial production, transforming consumer cities into production cities, and transforming agricultural China into industrial China are the general direction and overall task of all work today. However, the development of industry must first have sufficient grain, raw materials, and machinery, which can only be obtained after agricultural production is restored and developed. At the same time, industrial products need to be sold, and the peasants, who account for more than 80% of the total population, are a large market; however, the peasants' purchasing power is currently very low. Therefore, it is necessary to first vigorously restore and develop agricultural production, increase the peasants' purchasing power, and provide them with the necessary means of production and living, thereby expanding production and creating prerequisites for the development of industry. Based on this principle, the conference presented the current general task to all party, government, military, and civilian organizations and groups throughout the province, especially to all economic departments, and to all cadres, especially economic workers: under the centralized leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, to unify steps, overcome working in isolation, coordinate actions, orient towards the countryside, and strive to restore and develop agriculture and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. The conference also pointed out that the purpose of restoring and developing agricultural production is to develop industrial production and build cities, because without a strong industry, China will not be able to achieve true independence and autonomy, let alone move towards socialism. Therefore, while emphasizing agricultural production, urban industrial production cannot be relaxed at all; and currently, cities must serve the countryside, and industrial production must serve agriculture. Industrial manufacturing of agricultural tools, transportation equipment, and other items urgently needed by farmers must be vigorously led and supported. Based on the above general spirit, the conference made specific decisions on various tasks such as urban production, organizational leadership of small towns, cooperatives, banks, trade, transportation, and taxation. It also put forward the following specific requirements for the coming year:
    First, strive to export 500 million to 600 million jin of surplus grain, and achieve the goal of state-owned enterprises undertaking one-half of the export task; make the greatest effort to export 7 million jin of mountain products and medicinal herbs, promote the sale of hides, eggs, and bristles, and supply farmers with homespun cloth, cotton, and coal.
    Second, state-owned enterprises, banks, and cooperatives should work well together to organize industrial and handicraft production, supply farmers with agricultural machinery, supplement 1 million pieces of agricultural tools, and increase 3,500 rubber-tired carts, iron-wheeled carts, and sledges.
    Third, in terms of animal husbandry, breeding, and sideline production, relevant departments such as cooperatives, agriculture and forestry, women's federations, and party and government organs must vigorously lead, make good use of loans, combine with private capital, increase 200 breeding animals, establish 100 breeding animal stations, increase 50,000 head of cattle, horses, donkeys, and mules, and increase 600,000 pigs, 100,000 sheep, and 2.5 million chickens.
    Fourth, special emphasis should be placed on running cooperatives well. Some deputy secretaries and deputy county heads should be transferred to cooperatives. Party members should be called upon to take the lead in joining and investing in cooperatives. Efforts should be made to run urban supply and marketing cooperatives well within half a year to a year (whose task is also to provide supply and marketing services and agricultural production services to the countryside). On the basis of the conscious and voluntary participation of the vast number of peasants, old village cooperatives should be reorganized and new village cooperatives should be established, striving to run 500 to 1,000 relatively good village cooperatives.

　　Economic Situation of Chahar Province
    Note: Chahar Province (excluding the six counties west of Yanbei Road) currently has 18 million mu of cultivated land, with an annual output of 18 million shi of rice; the annual total value of industrial and mining production is 1.32 million shi; the annual income from animal husbandry and sideline production (including mountain products, medicinal herbs, cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, sheep, and chickens) is 1 million shi; and the annual income from handicrafts is 400,000 shi. Therefore, the economy of Chahar Province is still mainly agricultural, with agricultural income accounting for 87% of the total national economy. The mode of production is backward, remaining in a decentralized, individual, natural, and semi-natural economic form. However, due to the vast land and sparse population, 25% of the surplus grain is exported each year. Industry and mining only account for 6.4% of the national economy, but mineral reserves are abundant, and industry and mining already have a certain foundation. With slight restoration, they can exceed 10% of the proportion. Sideline production only accounts for 5% of the national economy, but there are vast grasslands, suitable for developing animal husbandry. The climate is relatively cold, the agricultural season is short, and farmers have ample time to engage in sideline production. Handicrafts only account for 2% of the total national income, but they are more concentrated in small towns and currently play a significant role in repairing and supplementing agricultural tools and transportation equipment. The province is inconveniently located, except along the PingSui Railway. There are only 73 small towns on the vast land spanning thousands of miles. In addition, the enemy's destruction and plunder during the long-term war destroyed the productivity and purchasing power of the vast number of peasants, creating a very abnormal supply and demand relationship: on the one hand, it is difficult to sell industrial products and the surplus agricultural products of farmers, and on the other hand, the vast number of farmers cannot afford to purchase the necessary means of livelihood and production. This is a difficult aspect of economic construction. However, on the other hand, since the entire province is liberated, urban industry, modernized transportation, etc., are all in the hands of the people, and the internal and external connections with neighboring regions are unimpeded. The isolation and antagonism between urban and rural areas caused by the war have been eliminated, and industry and agriculture have begun to be organically linked, helping and cooperating with each other, creating favorable conditions for common and rapid development. In addition, Chahar Province has vast land, abundant resources, and many superior conditions. As long as it is good at learning, does not make or makes few mistakes, and manages diligently, it is entirely possible to leap from a backward and closed area to an advanced economic front.

　　为工业发展创造前提
  　察省经济会议
  　强调面向农村
    今后一年需输出剩余粮食六亿斤
    【本报讯】察省首次经济会议，已于本月十一日胜利闭幕。会议经小组讨论、专题报告、大会发言，最后由省府张苏主席作结论。在历时九日的议程中，大会始终贯彻了这样的精神：为了发展工业生产，必先面向农村，恢复与发展农业生产；要想发家致富，首先依靠农业。大会指出：发展工业生产，变消费城市为生产城市，变农业中国为工业中国，是今日一切工作的总方针与总任务。但工业的发展，必须先有足够的粮食、原料与机器，这只有在农业生产得到恢复与发展后，才能获得。同时，工业生产的成品需要推销，占全部人口百分之八十以上的农民是一个大市场；但农民现在购买力很低，因此，必须首先大力恢复与发展农业生产，提高农民购买力，使他们得到必要的生产资料与生活资料，从而扩大生产，为发展工业创设前提。根据这个道理，大会向全省党、政、军、民各机关团体，尤其是各个经济部门；向全体干部，尤其经济工作者，提出了当前工作的总任务：在省委、省府的集中领导下，统一步调，克服各自为政，协同动作，面向农村，为恢复与发展农业与巩固工农联盟而努力。大会同时指出：恢复与发展农业生产的目的是为了发展工业生产、建设城市，因为若没有强大的工业，中国将无法获得真正的独立、自主，更无法走向社会主义。因此，在强调农业生产下，城市工业生产一点也不能放松；而目前城市要为农村服务，工业生产必须为农业服务。对农民迫切需要的农具、交通工具等工业制造业，必须大力领导与扶植。根据上述的总精神，大会对城市生产、小城镇的组织领导、合作社、银行、贸易、交通、税收等各项工作，均作了具体的决定。并提出今后一年的具体要求如下：
    第一、要为输出五亿到六亿斤剩余粮食，实现国营企业担负输出二分之一的任务而奋斗，要为输出七百万斤山货药材，推销皮毛、鸡子、猪鬃，供给农民土布、棉花、煤炭而尽最大努力。
    第二、国营企业与银行、合作社，要很好结合起来，组织工业和手工业生产，要供给农民若干农业机器。补充一百万件农具，增加三千五百辆胶皮车、铁轮车和旱板车。
    第三、在牧畜、饲养与副业生产方面，要求合作、农林、妇联等部门及党政机关，必须大力领导，很好的使用贷款，结合私人资本，要增加二百头种畜，建立一百处种畜站，增加五万头牛马驴骡，增加六十万只猪、十万只羊和二百五十万只鸡。
    第四、要特别强调办好合作社，要抽调一些县委副书记和副县长到合作社去，号召党员带头踊跃入社入股，争取半年到一年内，办好城镇供销社（其任务也是为农村的供销和农业生产服务），并在广大农民自觉自愿的基础上，整理旧村社，建立新村社，争取办好五百个到一千个较好的村社。
　　察省经济情况
    按：察哈尔全省（不包括雁北路西六县），现有耕地面积一千八百万亩，年产折米一千八百万市石；工矿生产年总值一百三十二万市石；牧畜、副业（包括山货、药材、牛、马、驴、骡、羊、鸡）年收入百万市石；手工业年收入四十万市石。因此，察省经济依然是农业为主，农业收入占全部国民经济的百分之八十七，且生产方式落后，停留在分散的个体的自然与半自然的经济形态。但由于地广人稀，每年却有百分之二十五的剩余粮食输出。工矿业则仅占国民经济的百分之六点四，但矿产蕴藏量丰富，工矿业已有一定基础，稍加恢复，即可超过百分之十的比重。副业只占国民经济的百分之五，但有广大草原，宜于发展牧畜，气候较冷，农忙季节短，农民有充分时间从事副业生产。手工业只占国民总收入的百分之二，但较集中于小城镇，目前对农业工具与运输工具的修理补充，关系很大。全省除平绥路沿线外，交通不便，在纵横千里的辽阔地面上，仅有七十三处小城镇。再加上在长期战争中敌人的摧残掠夺，破坏了广大农民的生产力与购买力，造成了目前一种很不正常的供求关系：一方面是工业品与农民的剩余生产品销售困难，另一方面却是广大农民对所需的生活资料与生产资料，无力购置。这是经济建设上困难的一方面。但另一方面，由于全省解放，城市工业、近代化交通等均为人民掌握，全境内部及与各友邻区之间已畅通无阻。战争所造成的城乡隔离与对立形势是消除了，工农业开始有机地联系起来，互相帮助和配合，为共同迅速发展创造了良好条件；加上察省土地辽阔，资源丰富，有许多优越条件，只要善于学习，不犯或少犯错误，兢兢业业地经营，完全有可能由落后闭塞的地区，一跃而为先进的经济阵地。
