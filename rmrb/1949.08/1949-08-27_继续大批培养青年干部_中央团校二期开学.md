　　Continuing to Train Young Cadres in Large Numbers
  　The Second Term of the Central Youth League School Begins
    [Our Newspaper] The second term of the Central Committee of the Youth League School opened on the 20th. 1,197 students from the entire school, as well as all staff and guests, attended the ceremony. Comrade Gao Tang, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Youth League, spoke at the meeting, hoping that the students of the League School would study hard and prepare to undertake arduous construction tasks. First, be prepared to endure hardship. As Party and League members, we must endure hardship before enjoying happiness. Second, strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Third, learn with humility, be realistic, be honest, be lively and cheerful, and unite and help each other.
    Next, Dean Zhang Fan spoke. He first described the purpose and task of running the League School. He said: "In order to adapt to the needs of the national League building, the Party Central Committee decided that the Central Committee of the League should be responsible for running the League School. The task is to train batches of young cadres with new ideas and styles, and to serve the people wholeheartedly." He put forward four points of instruction and hope: (1) First, we must establish the correct view of studying for the people, and all incorrect views for individuals must be discarded. (2) All staff and students of the school should unite. Because students come from different regions and positions, and have differences in life, education, and political level, it is easy to form disunity. To unite well, Comrade Zhang Fan pointed out: "We must find common ground in the differences, that is, our revolutionary goal is consistent. We must unite on the basis of this principle. In addition, we must learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for our weaknesses, see other people's strengths, learn from other people's strengths, and not just see other people's weaknesses and regard our own strengths as burdens." (3) Strengthen organization and discipline. Only by doing this can we better ensure the completion of our learning tasks. (4) Everyone should use their hands and brains to build their own League School from the perspective of learning experience, ideology, work style, and material resources.

　　继续大批培养青年干部
  　中央团校二期开学
    【本报讯】青年团中央团校第二期已于二十日举行开学典礼。参加典礼的有全校同学一千一百九十七人及全校工作人员与来宾。团中央秘书长高棠同志在会上讲话，希望团校同学努力学习，准备担负艰苦的建设任务。第一、准备吃苦，我们是党团员要吃苦在先，享福在后；第二、努力学习马列主义、毛泽东思想；第三、虚心学习，实事求是，老老实实，活泼愉快，团结互助。
    继由教育长张凡同志讲话。先叙述了办团校的目的与任务。他说：“为了适应全国建团需要，由党中央决定团中央负责举办团校。任务是：训练一批批具有新思想新作风的青年干部，全心全意为人民服务。”他提出四点指示与希望：（一）首先要确立为人民而学习的正确观点，一切为个人的非正确的观点都要扔掉。（二）全校工作人员、同学团结起来。因为同学们来自各地区、各岗位，在生活上、文化程度上、政治水平上都有不同，容易形成不团结现象。要团结得好，张凡同志指出：“要在不同的中间找出共同之点，这就是我们革命的目标是一致的。在这样原则的基础上来团结。另外就是要互相学习，取长补短，看到人家优点，学习人家的优点，不要光看到人家的缺点，而把自己的优点当成包袱。”（三）加强组织性与纪律性，只有做到这一点我们才能更好的保证学习任务的完成。（四）大家动手动脑，从学习经验上思想作风上，物质上来建设自己的团校。
