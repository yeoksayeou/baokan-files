Following the Russian Path
——Notes on Reading "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship"
Shu
In "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," Chairman Mao pointed out that our revolutionary predecessors "sought revolutionary truth with tireless efforts to rejuvenate the country." They searched for decades, and what they sought were all Western capitalist countries. They learned a lot, but it never worked because the teacher always invaded the student. It was not until the October Revolution in Russia that the Chinese people found Marxism-Leninism, a universal truth applicable everywhere. Thus, they reconsidered their own problems and "followed the Russian path – this is the conclusion." From then on, the Chinese revolution embarked on the correct path. Although it suffered the devastation of the Kuomintang bandit gang and other counter-revolutionary forces, as well as the invasion of Japanese imperialism, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, finally overcame any difficulties with unyielding perseverance. Currently, the national revolutionary situation has achieved a basic victory and will soon achieve a nationwide victory. Historical facts have proven that our Chinese revolution was absolutely right to "follow the Russian path," and there is no other path.

Of course, we must clearly recognize here that the "Russian path" that Chairman Mao spoke of refers to the truth of Marxism-Leninism, the leadership of the proletariat over the revolution, the direction of moving towards socialism and communism, and the various basic experiences of carrying out socialist and communist construction. It does not mean blindly imitating without regard to the different specific historical conditions, "stepping where Confucius stepped, running where Confucius ran." The realization of the Russian revolutionary road in China is Mao Zedong Thought—the combination of Marxist-Leninist theory with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution. Comparing the current Chinese revolution with the Russian revolution at that time, the general direction is consistent, but the revolutionary steps are different. For example, after the revolution, the Soviet Union immediately entered the path of socialist construction. However, because China was even more backward than Russia at the time of the October Revolution, it had to take an additional step, first building a New Democratic society and then transitioning to a socialist society in the future.

Do these two different revolutionary steps signify that the two are completely different? No, New Democracy is a necessary historical stage for China to move towards socialism, and its purpose is to lay the foundation for the future transition to socialism. In this transformation process, the latter is closely related to the former. Generally speaking, China's current policy towards the capitalist economy is somewhat similar to the Soviet Union's New Economic Policy period, so many of the methods during the Soviet Union's New Economic Policy period are worth learning from. For example, during the period from the October Revolution to the New Economic Policy, the Soviet Union implemented a method of state capitalism, one of which was the establishment of purchasing and sales relationships between the state and private capitalists, which is practical in China today. In addition, although we cannot implement the planned economy implemented by the Soviet Union on a larger scale, it is possible to carry out planned allocation of production within state-owned enterprises. Furthermore, it is also necessary in China today, as Lenin did, to mobilize party members to learn how to do business. Of course, the Soviet Union has accumulated many experiences and lessons in the entire course of revolutionary construction that are worth learning from in China. The above are just examples.

Following the Russian path is something we should do not only in overthrowing reactionary rule, but also in future construction.

### “走俄国人的路”——读“论人民民主专政”笔记

    “走俄国人的路”
    ——读“论人民民主专政”笔记
    舒
    毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中指出我们的先烈，“为使国家复兴，不惜艰苦奋斗，找寻革命真理”，找寻了数十年，所找的都是西方资本主义国家，学得倒不少，总是行不通，因为先生老是侵略学生。直到俄国十月革命，中国人找到了马克思列宁主义这个放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，于是重新考虑自己的问题，“走俄国人的路——这是结论。”从此以后，中国革命走上了正确的方向，虽然历经国民党匪帮及其他反革命势力的摧残及日本帝国主义的侵略，中国人民在中国共产党领导下，终于百折不挠地战胜了任何困难，目前全国革命形势已取得了基本胜利，不久即将取得全国的胜利。历史事实证明：我们中国革命“走俄国人的路”是千真万确的走对了，而且只有这条路，再没有别的路。
    当然，我们在这里要明确地认识，毛主席所说的“走俄国人的路”，是指的马列主义的真理，指的无产阶级对于革命的领导，指的走向社会主义和共产主义的方向和实行社会主义共产主义建设的各种基本经验，而不是说不顾具体历史条件的不同而依样画葫芦，“孔步亦步，孔趋亦趋”。俄国革命道路在中国的实现，就是毛泽东思想——马列主义理论与中国革命具体实践相结合。就目前中国革命与当时俄国革命来比较，总的方向是一致的，而革命的步骤则有所不同。如苏联在革命以后，马上就跨入社会主义建设的途程；而中国由于比十月革命时的俄国还落后，所以也就不能不多采取一个步骤，先建设新民主主义社会，将来再过渡到社会主义社会。
    这两个不同的革命步骤，是不是就标志着两者截然不同呢？不是的，新民主主义是中国走向社会主义必经的历史阶段，它的目的是在打下将来转向社会主义的基础。在这个转化过程中，后者是与前者密切相关联的。大体上说，中国目前对资本主义经济的政策与苏联新经济政策时期有某些类似，所以苏联新经济政策时期的有许多办法是值得我们学习的。例如苏联在十月革命以后到新经济政策时期曾实行了一种国家资本主义的办法，其办法之一是由国家与私人资本家之间建立购销关系，这在目前中国就是实用的。此外，如苏联所实行的计划经济，我们虽还不能在较大的范围内实行，但在国营企业内作有计划的调配生产，那是可能的。又如列宁曾动员党员去学做生意，这在目前中国也是必要的。当然苏联在整个革命建设的途径中，积累了的经验教训，值得中国学习的是很多很多的，以上不过是举例而已。
    “走俄国人的路”，不仅在推翻反动统治方面我们应当如此，即在今后建设中也要如此。
