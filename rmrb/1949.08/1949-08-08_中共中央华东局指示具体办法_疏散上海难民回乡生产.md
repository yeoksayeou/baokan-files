Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 7th. In order to make the work of sending refugees back to their hometowns for production, which began in Shanghai at the end of June, more planned, step-by-step, and effective, the East China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee issued instructions on July 24th, explaining the necessity of sending refugees and the specific methods for sending them. The instructions pointed out: In order to overcome the difficulties imposed on Shanghai by the blockade of imperialism and the remnants of the Kuomintang, it is necessary to make the greatest determination to change the deformed state of Shanghai's semi-colonial economy, free it from its dependence on imperialism, and make it a production city of the Chinese people. It is necessary to adopt the most effective methods to evacuate a large number of unemployed and jobless citizens to return to their hometowns for production, so as to reduce the burden on the city and increase rural production. For all unemployed and jobless citizens, we should not adopt the passive method of temporary relief and on-site maintenance, but should adopt the active policy of "evacuation to return to hometowns for production." The instructions pointed out that in order to effectively carry out this arduous task of repatriation:

First, it is necessary to carry out universal publicity and education to eliminate the concerns of refugees returning to their hometowns for production. First of all, it is necessary to clearly publicize our Party's policy, that is, for landlords and rich peasants who fled their hometowns, except for individual cases where those who have committed heinous crimes and murder must be dealt with according to the severity of their crimes, for individual landlords and rich peasants who have oppressed peasants, as long as they can correct their mistakes and engage in production after returning to their hometowns, the government and the people will definitely give them lenient treatment and will not pursue the matter. For general landlords who return to their hometowns for production, local governments and peasant associations should allocate them their due share of land and housing, so that they have the opportunity to engage in production, labor, and transformation. For peasants and young people who have been deceived by reactionary propaganda or forced to leave their hometowns by the Kuomintang reactionary forces, they should be explained the policies and welcomed to return to their hometowns to participate in production and construction. It is necessary to mobilize through the activists among the refugees, organize the refugees, and launch a movement for refugees to voluntarily return to their hometowns for production.

Second, in order to implement the policy of evacuating refugees to return to their hometowns for production, urban and rural work must be closely coordinated. Shanghai should focus on the mobilization, organization, and transportation of refugees; Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, and other places should be responsible for receiving and organizing refugees to settle down and engage in production. They can also send representatives of the People's Government and peasant associations from the county as a unit to Shanghai to mobilize, or use reliable people who have returned to their hometowns and settled down to mobilize in Shanghai or send letters to mobilize. As for the determination of transportation routes, the establishment of food and accommodation stations along the way, the methods of receiving and resettling refugees after returning to their hometowns, and the number of refugees that each region can accommodate, all these issues should be specifically discussed and agreed upon in advance by both parties to avoid disconnection. In addition, special cadres should be assigned to lead the refugees back to their hometowns. A completely responsible attitude should be adopted towards the entire process of evacuating refugees to return to their hometowns for production, and an irresponsible attitude of simply evacuating and ignoring them should not be adopted.

Third, the work of evacuating refugees to return to their hometowns for production should be combined with social relief work. All charitable relief organizations should be mobilized to serve the evacuation work, persuading them to change their past passive methods of simple relief and on-site maintenance, and to focus their relief work on helping evacuate refugees to return to their hometowns for production. In order to mobilize refugees to return to their hometowns for production, those who voluntarily return to their hometowns for production and have practical difficulties should be given various conveniences and necessary relief. Those who are unwilling to return to their hometowns for production should be given less relief or no relief, in order to break the idea of relying on relief and living in complacency.

Fourth, in addition to mobilizing general refugees to return to their original hometowns, settle down separately, and engage in production locally, we should also start from the perspective of developing production in the entire East China region, and plan to mobilize and organize a group of refugees to go to the Yellow River flooded area in Northern Anhui and the reclamation area in Northern Jiangsu to engage in reclamation and planting, and produce industrial raw materials (such as cotton, grain, etc.). This is of great significance for future economic construction. To this end, the East China Bureau has decided that the Agriculture and Forestry Department of the East China Finance Office, in cooperation with the Northern Jiangsu and Northern Anhui Administrative Offices, will establish specialized reclamation institutions in Dongtai and Fuyang respectively to preside over this work. The Agriculture and Forestry Department should immediately send people to the reclamation area to conduct on-site investigations, and formulate specific reclamation plans with the local Party and government leading organs, and actively carry out preparations for receiving and resettling reclamation people. There must be a strict organization for the reclamation people who go to the reclamation area, and a person in charge must be assigned to lead them. The East China Finance Office, the Shanghai Agriculture and Forestry Department, and the Northern Jiangsu and Northern Anhui Regional Party Committees and Administrative Offices are responsible for making full preparations for the houses, food, land, farm tools, livestock, and seeds needed by the reclamation people. The East China Finance Office and the Shanghai Agriculture and Forestry Department should make full use of the materials, machinery, and technical personnel received in Shanghai to develop production work in the reclamation area. The relevant special offices, counties, and district Party and government organs should take assisting refugees in reclamation as one of the central tasks.

Fifth, fully organize and use various means of transportation available for evacuation, and in addition to ships and trains, all sailboats, carts, etc. should also be used to their full potential. All localities should invest in developing urban and rural transportation cooperation, and promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.

Sixth, evacuation funds mainly rely on launching social mutual assistance, and then the government provides necessary assistance. First of all, all charitable relief organizations should be mobilized to contribute money and efforts to the evacuation work. Secondly, the People's Government should allocate a portion of the consolation money as evacuation expenses. The vast majority of this fund should be used to help people returning to their hometowns to settle down and engage in production in rural areas, and a portion should be invested in developing the transportation industry, and a portion should be used for necessary relief in cities.

Seventh, in order to complete this arduous evacuation work, it has been decided to establish a special committee under the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee to study specific implementation plans in accordance with the above-mentioned policy of "evacuating to return to hometowns for production," and to contact various mass organizations and social charitable relief organizations in Shanghai to jointly establish the Shanghai Municipal Evacuation of Refugees to Return to Hometowns for Production Relief Committee, as an agency for widely mobilizing, organizing, and implementing the evacuation of refugees to return to their hometowns for production. For the working cadres needed for the evacuation work, in addition to mobilizing some students to participate, we should try our best to draw from the rural work cadres who are currently working in the city as the backbone. The Shandong Sub-bureau, the Lu Zhongnan, Northern Jiangsu, and Northern Anhui Regional Party Committees should immediately prepare to organize the reception of refugees returning to their hometowns to participate in production. From the administrative office to the county and district, specialized committees should be established to receive refugees returning to their hometowns for production, and special personnel should be sent to quickly contact the Shanghai Municipal Evacuation of Refugees to Return to Hometowns for Production Relief Committee to jointly formulate evacuation and reception plans. The areas with concentrated large cities such as Southern Jiangsu and Zhejiang should also formulate plans for evacuating the population back to their hometowns for production in accordance with the spirit of this instruction.

The instructions finally pointed out that evacuating the excessive consumer population and refugees in the city to return to their hometowns for production is an extremely arduous, complex, and difficult task. It must rely on the concerted efforts of the entire Party, the entire army, and people of all strata to work together in order to carry it out effectively. Therefore, the movement to evacuate to return to hometowns for production must become a broad mass movement, and all plans and methods for evacuating refugees to return to their hometowns for production must be deeply discussed and adopted by representatives of people from all walks of life. The raising of evacuation funds and the expenditure of relief items must be absolutely open.

    中共中央华东局指示具体办法
    疏散上海难民回乡生产
    【新华社上海七日电】为了使上海自六月底即已开始的遣送难民回乡生产工作更加有计划、有步骤和有效地进行起见，中共中央华东局特于七月二十四日发布指示，说明遣送难民的必要和遣送的具体办法。指示指出：为了克服帝国主义和国民党残余势力的封锁所加于上海的困难，必须下最大决心改变上海半殖民地经济的畸形状态，使之摆脱对帝国主义的依赖，成为中国人民自己的生产城市；必须采取最有效的方法疏散大批失业及无业的市民回乡生产，以减轻城市的负担，增加农村的生产。对一切失业及无业的市民不能采取暂时救济与就地维持的消极办法，而应采取“疏散回乡生产”的积极方针。指示指出，为了有效地进行这一艰巨的遣送工作：
    第一、必须普遍地进行宣传教育，以消除难民回乡生产的顾虑。首先要明确宣传我党的政策，即对逃亡离乡的地主、富农，除个别罪大恶极、犯过杀人罪行的必须分别轻重予以法办外，对个别欺压过农民的地主、富农，只要其回乡后能改过自新，进行生产，政府和人民定予宽大处理，不加追究。对一般逃亡地主返乡生产，各地政府与农会应分予应得的一份土地、房屋，使他们有生产劳动和改造的机会。对受反动宣传欺骗蒙蔽、或被国民党反动势力强迫离乡的农民和青年，则应向其解释政策，欢迎他们回乡参加生产建设。要通过难民中的积极分子进行动员，将难民组织起来，发动难民自愿回乡生产的运动。
    第二、为了贯彻疏散难民回乡生产的方针，城乡工作必须密切协同配合。上海市应着重于难民疏散的动员、组织及输送工作；山东、苏北、皖北及其他各地应负责接收与组织难民安家生产的工作，并可以县为单位由人民政府及农会派代表到上海动员或利用已回乡安家的可靠分子，回沪动员或来信动员。至于运输线之规定、沿途食宿站之设置、回乡后收容安插之方法及每一地区所能容纳之数量等问题，均应事先双方统一具体商定，力求避免脱节现象；遣送时并应指派专门干部率领回乡。对疏散回乡生产的全部过程，应采取完全负责的态度，不能采取遣散了事的不负责任的态度。
    第三、疏散难民回乡生产的工作要与社会救济工作相结合。应动员一切慈善救济机关为疏散工作服务，说服他们改变其过去单纯救济与就地维持的消极方法，而应将救济工作重点放在帮助疏散回乡生产方面。为了动员难民回乡生产，对自愿回乡生产而有实际困难者，应给以各种方便与必要的救济；对不愿回乡生产者，应少予救济或不予救济，以打破依赖救济、得过且过的偷安思想。
    第四、除动员一般难民各返原乡、分别安插、就地生产外，还应从发展华东全区生产着眼，有计划地动员和组织一批难民前往皖北黄泛区及苏北垦区从事垦植，生产工业原料（如棉花、粮食等）。这对今后经济建设有极大意义。为此，华东局决定由华东财办农林处协同苏北及皖北两行政公署分别于东台及阜阳两地设立专门的垦植机构，主持此项工作。农林处应即派人前往垦区进行实地调查，并与当地党政领导机关订出具体的垦植计划，积极进行各项收容及安置垦民的准备。对前往垦区的垦民，必须有严密的组织，并有负责人率领前往。对垦民所需的房屋、口粮、土地、农具、畜力及种子，责成华东财办及上海农林处和苏北、皖北区党委、行署预作充分的准备。华东财办及上海农林处应充分利用上海接收的物资、机器、技术人员，发展垦区生产工作。各有关专署、县、区党政机关应将扶助难民进行垦植，作为中心工作之一。
    第五、充分组织使用各种可供疏散运输的交通工具，除轮船、火车外，一切帆船、小车等也应尽量发挥其作用。各地应投资发展城乡运输合作事业，促进城乡物资的交流。
    第六、疏散经费主要依靠发动社会互济，再由政府加以必要的协助。首先要动员一切慈善救济机关为疏散工作出钱出力，其次由人民政府在慰劳费中拨出一部分充作疏散费用。此项经费的绝大部分应用于帮助回乡人民在农村中安家生产，并以一部分投入发展运输事业，而以一部分用于城市中必要的救济。
    第七、为完成这一艰巨的疏散工作，决定在上海市委之下设立专门委员会，根据上述“疏散回乡生产”方针，研究具体进行计划，并联络上海各群众团体、各社会慈善救济团体，共同建立上海市疏散难民回乡生产救济委员会，作为广泛动员、组织、执行疏散难民回乡生产的机关。对于疏散工作所需的工作干部，除动员一部分学生参加外，应尽量从现在城市工作的农村工作干部中抽调作为骨干。山东分局、鲁中南、苏北、皖北等地的区党委应即准备有组织地接收难民回乡参加生产的工作。自行署到县、区均应建立接收难民回乡生产的专门委员会，并应派专人迅速与上海市疏散难民回乡生产救济委员会取得联系，统一制定疏散与接收的计划。苏南、浙江等大城市集中地区亦应本此指示精神作出疏散人口返乡生产的计划。
    指示最后指出：疏散城市过多的消费人口与难民回乡生产工作，是一件极繁重复杂而艰巨的工作，必须依靠全党、全军与各阶层人民通力合作，共同努力，始能有效进行。因此，疏散回乡生产运动必须成为广大群众运动，对一切疏散难民回乡生产的计划和办法，必须发动各界人民代表深入讨论通过。疏散经费的募集、赈目的开支必须绝对公开。
