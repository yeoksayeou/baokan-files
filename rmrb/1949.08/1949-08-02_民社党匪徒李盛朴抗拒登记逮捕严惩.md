    Minzhu Shehuidang (Democratic Socialist Party) Bandit Li Shengpu
    Resists Registration, Arrested and Severely Punished
    [This City News] The reactionary Minzhu Shehuidang (Democratic Socialist Party) key member, Li Shengpu, violated the order of the Beijing Military Control Commission by refusing to register, destroying the registration office, and assaulting staff members. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has arrested him and will severely punish him. Li Shengpu was originally a Japanese occupation's Beiping (Beijing) Military Police special agent, specializing in inspecting postal and telecommunications. After the Japanese surrender, he continued as an inspector in the Kuomintang Beiping puppet police bureau, head of household registration in the puppet Southern Suburb Branch Bureau, and engaged in espionage work at the Liangxiang puppet police bureau and other places, persecuting the people and committing numerous evils. When he was the director of the puppet Inner First Branch Bureau, he introduced many police officers to join the reactionary Minzhu Shehuidang (Democratic Socialist Party). After the liberation of Beiping, he went into hiding in the city. After the Military Control Commission announced the proclamation for the registration of personnel from reactionary parties, on July 31st, Zhai Youmei, a police officer from the Second Police Station of the Inner First Branch Bureau of Public Security, mobilized him to register. After Li arrived at the police station, he cursed and insulted the people's police. After arriving at the registration office of the Inner First Branch Bureau, the criminal stubbornly refused to register and hand over organizational information and credentials, and even dared to destroy door and window glass and assault registration office personnel. In order to strictly enforce the people's laws and maintain revolutionary order, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, regarding this incorrigible, unrepentant, and reactionary party member who took the People's Government's lenient policy as something to be taken advantage of, has arrested him and will severely punish him according to the law.
