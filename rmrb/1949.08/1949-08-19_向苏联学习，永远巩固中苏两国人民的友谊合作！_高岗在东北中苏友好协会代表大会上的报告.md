　　Learn from the Soviet Union, and Forever Consolidate the Friendship and Cooperation Between the Chinese and Soviet People!
    Report by Gao Gang at the Northeast China-Soviet Friendship Association Representative Conference
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th] Gao Gang, Secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a report at the Northeast China-Soviet Friendship Association Representative Conference on the 14th, calling on all people in Northeast China to strive for the everlasting consolidation of the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people. He pointed out: A major reason why the Chinese people have been able to achieve such a great victory today is that they have received assistance from the international revolutionary forces, headed by the Soviet Union. After briefly narrating the historical facts of the Soviet Union's consistent assistance to the Chinese revolution since the October Revolution, he said: Historical experience has repeatedly proved that whenever the friendship between China and the Soviet Union is consolidated and developed, the Chinese people's struggle for independence and liberation gains tremendous development; conversely, the Chinese nation and the Chinese people suffer serious disasters. Is it not obvious that opposing the Soviet Union is opposing the Chinese people and harming the greatest interests of the Chinese people? Chairman Mao instructed us to lean to one side, towards the Soviet Union, and its great significance lies here. He said: The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War has cleared away the obstacles to friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, and now no force can prevent us from openly joining hands in cooperation. Although the imperialists will continue to do everything possible to sow discord, the Chinese people have enough awareness and strength to shatter this discord and will never allow anyone to undermine the deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. In the period when China is about to systematically carry out various new democratic constructions, the Chinese people need even more the assistance of the world revolutionary forces, first and foremost the assistance from the Soviet Union in all aspects, and the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people will enter a new historical stage. The one-year trade agreement signed between Northeast China and the Soviet Union is the beginning of this new stage. He said: It is undeniable that we have many difficulties in economic construction, mainly the lack of industrial technology and equipment and the lack of experience. But we will certainly create achievements in economic construction that the imperialists and domestic reactionaries never dreamed of, because, first, our hardworking and courageous people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, will be able to develop unlimited initiative and creativity to overcome all difficulties. Second, we are willing to learn with humility and have the Soviet Union as our best teacher. Third, our cause can gain the assistance of international revolutionary forces, and mainly the assistance of the Soviet Union. These will ensure that we will win the victory in economic construction just as we won the victory in the past war.
    He called on everyone to work hard to learn from the Soviet Union. He said: We must learn from the Soviet experience carefully and honestly, and combine the Soviet experience with China's specific realities, so that we can overcome all difficulties and stride forward to victory. He pointed out: To learn from the Soviet experience, first, we must oppose narrow nationalism and promote internationalism. In order to consolidate the victory of the people and shatter the conspiracy of the imperialists and all counter-revolutionaries to sow discord in the friendly relations between the Chinese and Soviet people, we must thoroughly eliminate narrow nationalism. The interests of the Chinese people are completely consistent with the interests of the Soviet and other countries' people, and a true new patriotic person of the people must also be an internationalist. Second, we must oppose empiricism and advocate a keen sense of new things. We must have the spirit of being an elementary school student, if we don't understand, we don't understand, don't pretend to understand; if we can't do it, we have to learn, don't put on airs, don't be complacent and arrogant. He said: After the establishment of the Northeast General Branch of the China-Soviet Friendship Association, it should shoulder the responsibility of promoting this kind of learning from the Soviet Union, and systematically introduce the achievements of the Soviet Union's socialist construction, publicize the Soviet Union's great assistance and sincere friendship to the Chinese people, and introduce the Soviet Union's experience in various aspects of construction, especially in managing the economy and improving technology, among members and people of all strata in a planned and systematic way. We must take advantage of every opportunity to pay attention to eliminating the vicious influence of the reactionaries' rumors and slander against the Soviet Union among the people, expose all their acts of sowing discord, so that the Chinese people have a full and correct understanding of the Soviet Union, and continuously improve and develop the tradition of friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. He also said: The nature of the China-Soviet Friendship Association is a broad mass organization based on the working people. Anyone who agrees with new democracy and supports China-Soviet friendship, regardless of class, ethnicity, or belief, is eligible to join. Now the Northeast General Branch has more than 400,000 members, and it should continue to expand tenfold or even dozens of times. The organizations of the China-Soviet Friendship Association at all levels in Northeast China must be enriched; there must be concrete work and activities, and formalism should be avoided. Members should be given regular education, and the connection between the China-Soviet Friendship Association and its members should be strengthened and consolidated through newspapers, periodicals, radio, movies, exhibitions, popular reading materials, lectures, and inviting Soviet experts to give reports, so as to unite all members closely around themselves.

　　向苏联学习，永远巩固中苏两国人民的友谊合作！
    高岗在东北中苏友好协会代表大会上的报告
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】中共中央东北局书记高岗十四日在东北中苏友好协会代表大会上作了报告，号召全东北人民为永远巩固中苏两国人民的友谊合作而努力。他指出：中国人民所以能获得今天这样伟大胜利的一个主要原因，就是得到了以苏联为首的国际革命力量的援助。他在扼要地叙述了自十月革命以来苏联一直援助中国革命的历史事实以后说：历史经验反复证明了：凡是中苏友谊得到巩固和发展的时候，中国人民争取独立自由的解放斗争就获得了巨大的发展，反之，中华民族与中国人民就遭受到严重的灾难。反对苏联就是反对中国人民，就是危害中国人民的最大利益，难道这还不是十分明显的吗？毛主席指示我们要向苏联一边倒，其伟大的意义即在这里。他说：中国人民解放战争的胜利，扫清了中苏人民友好的障碍，现在再没有任何力量能阻止我们公开地携手合作。尽管帝国主义者还要继续千方百计地进行挑拨离间，但中国人民已有足够的觉悟和力量来粉碎这种挑拨离间，再也不允许任何人来破坏中苏两国人民的深厚友谊。在中国即将转入有系统的进行各种新民主主义建设的时期，中国人民更需要世界革命力量的援助，首先和主要的是苏联在各方面的援助，中苏人民的友谊即要进入一个新的历史阶段。东北和苏联所签订的一年贸易协定，就是这个新阶段的开端。他说：不可否认，我们在经济建设当中，存在许多困难，主要是缺乏工业技术装备和经验不足的困难。但我们一定会在经济建设方面，创造出帝国主义者和国内反动派所梦想不到的成就来，因为第一，我们勤劳而勇敢的人民大众，在毛主席领导下，定能发扬无限的积极性和创造性，克服一切困难。第二，我们肯于虚心学习，且有苏联这个最好的教师。第三，我们的事业能得国际革命力量的援助而且主要的是苏联的援助。这些就会保证我们象过去赢得了战争的胜利一样，进而赢得经济建设上的胜利。
    他号召大家努力向苏联学习。他说：我们对苏联经验必须仔仔细细地学，老老实实地学，把苏联的经验和中国具体实际结合起来，我们就能排除一切困难，大踏步地走向胜利。他指出：要学好苏联的经验，第一、必须反对狭隘的民族主义，发扬国际主义。为了巩固人民的胜利，粉碎帝国主义及一切反革命分子挑拨中苏人民友谊关系的阴谋，我们必须彻底肃清狭隘的民族主义。中国人民利益与苏联及各国人民利益是完全一致的，真正的人民的新爱国主义者，同时必须是国际主义者。第二、必须反对经验主义，提倡对新鲜事物的锐敏的感觉。要拿出当小学生的精神来，不懂就不懂，不要装作懂；不会就要学，不要摆架子，不要自满自傲。他说：中苏友好协会东北总分会成立之后，就要担负起推动这种学习苏联的责任，在会员中，在各阶层的人民中，有计划有系统地介绍苏联社会主义建设的成就，宣传苏联对中国人民伟大的援助与忠诚的友谊，介绍苏联各方面建设的经验，特别是管理经济和提高技术的经验。要利用一切机会，随时随地地注意肃清反动派在人民中对苏联进行造谣诬蔑的恶毒影响，揭露其一切挑拨离间行为，使中国人民对苏联有充分正确的认识和了解，把中苏人民的友谊传统，继续不断地提高和发展。他又说：中苏友好协会的性质是以劳动人民为基础的广泛的群众组织，凡是赞成新民主主义，拥护中苏友好的人，不分阶级、民族、信仰都有入会资格。现在东北总分会有四十多万会员，应该继续扩大到十倍以至几十倍。东北各级中苏友好协会的组织，必须加以充实；要有具体的工作与活动，避免形式主义。对会员要进行经常教育，通过报纸、刊物、广播、电影、展览会、通俗读物、讲演、请苏联专家作报告等等方式，加强与巩固中苏友好协会与会员的联系，把全体会员紧紧团结在自己的周围。
