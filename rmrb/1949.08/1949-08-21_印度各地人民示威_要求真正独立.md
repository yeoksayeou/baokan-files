Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th: Delhi dispatch: August 15th marked the second anniversary of the declaration of India's so-called "independence," and the Indian people held mass demonstrations demanding genuine independence. On that day, a conference and demonstration were held in Calcutta to protest the Nehru reactionary government's barbaric policy of suppression and to oppose India's remaining within the British Commonwealth. Police wielded batons to beat demonstrators and opened fire on the demonstration procession several times, injuring a number of people. Similar demonstrations also occurred in Madras and other places. In the United Provinces, political prisoners in Aligarh Prison raised black flags on "Independence" Day and threw stones and bricks at prison guards to resist their violent suppression.

In order to suppress the Indian people's resistance movement on "Independence" Day, the Indian reactionary government launched a new wave of anti-communism throughout India on the eve of and on "Independence" Day. A large-scale search was carried out in Tinnevelly, Madras Province, and thirty-two people were arrested. Arrests of communists occurred in Ahmedabad, Travancore, Bombay, Aligarh, and Calcutta.

Moscow Radio commented on the 17th on the second anniversary of Indian "independence," stating that India and Pakistan are adapting their policies to the political, economic, and military domination of Anglo-American militarism. The ruling classes of India and Pakistan have no intention of seeking independence, and the workers of these two countries have learned from their personal sacrifices that their countries have not escaped the shackles of foreign imperialism. The commentary pointed out that the partition of India was a cunning plot by British imperialism to maintain its rule in these two countries. The commentary stated that in the two years since the establishment of the two new dominions, the facts have exposed the lies asserted by the British Labor Party leaders and the Indian and Pakistani ruling classes, which claimed that Britain had voluntarily ended its two hundred years of rule over India.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th: TASS Delhi dispatch, 18th: The strike movement of Indian workers continues to expand. Seven thousand workers at the Kanpur Ordnance Factory went on strike to protest the dismissal of several workers. Prior to this, transportation workers in Delhi also began a strike, which is still continuing.

　　印度各地人民示威
  　要求真正独立
    【新华社北平二十日电】德里讯：八月十五日，是宣布印度所谓“独立”的两周年纪念日，印度人民举行了要求真正独立的群众示威。当天，加尔各答举行大会和示威，抗议尼赫鲁反动政府野蛮的镇压政策，并反对印度留在不列颠联邦内。警察挥捧殴打示威者，并数次向示威行列开枪，打伤了若干人。在马德拉斯及其他若干地方，亦发生了类似的示威事件。在联合省，阿里加尔监狱的政治犯于“独立”日升起黑旗，并用石头及砖块掷击监狱守卫，反抗他们的暴力镇压。
    为了压制印度人民在“独立”日的抵抗运动，在“独立”日的前夕和当天，印度反动政府在印度各地掀起了反共新浪潮。马德拉斯省的丁奈维里地方实施大规模搜查，捕去了三十二人。阿麦达巴德、特拉凡德仑、孟买、阿里加尔及加尔各答，都发生逮捕共产党人事件。
    莫斯科广播十七日评论印度“独立”两周年纪念称：印度与巴基斯坦正使其政策适合于英美军国主义的政治、经济及军事统治。印度和巴基斯坦的统治阶级无意求得独立，而这两个国家的工人，已从他们亲身所受的牺牲中了解他们的国家并未摆脱外国帝国主义的枷锁。评论指出：印度的分治，乃是英帝国主义为保持在这两个国家的统治权所实行的狡猾阴谋。评论称：自两个新自治领成立以后的两年内，事实已揭穿了英国工党领袖与印、巴统治阶级所断言的谎言，这个谎言说英国已自愿地结束其二百年对印度的统治。
    【新华社北平二十日电】据塔斯社德里十八日讯，印度工人的罢工运动续继扩大。堪蒲尔兵工厂七千工人举行罢工，抗议开除若干工人。在这以前，德里市运输工人亦开始罢工，至今仍在继续中。
