    Municipal Trade Company's Nine Hundred Cadres
    Participate in Learning Test
    Group Discussions After Papers are Graded
    [This City News] The Municipal Trade Company held a unified test for cadres of its subordinate units on July 20th. Participants included the Municipal Company, the Department Store Branch, the Coal and Iron Branch, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch, the Trust Branch, the Changlu Salt Industry Branch, the Grain Branch, and the Yumin Mountain Goods Depot, totaling 946 people.
    The test content covered various documents published in the Party newspapers on "July 1st" and "July 7th", as well as speeches by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu at the preparatory meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference, and the Communist Manifesto inaugural issue. The method of implementation was to use the study committee branch as a unit, utilizing two hours in the morning, with papers submitted before breakfast (test questions were distributed uniformly by the Municipal Company Study Committee). During this test, many confused viewpoints among cadres were discovered. For example, a comrade from the Changlu Salt Industry Branch said in his answer: "China's revolution needed international help in the past, but now that we have big cities and can manufacture guns and bullets, we don't need international help anymore." A comrade from the Department Store Branch answered: "The old and new Political Consultative Conferences are the same."
    This test stimulated the cadres' enthusiasm for learning and laid the foundation for studying the next document. After taking the test, the vast majority of people in the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch became more serious about learning than before. At the same time, after the test papers were graded, they were returned to the study groups for discussion. They had a deeper understanding of the spirit of the documents. Some people reflected that the test was more effective than half a month of study. Many people believe that testing is a good way to promote learning and demand that this system be maintained.

    市贸易公司九百干部
    参加学习测验
    卷子评好后小组讨论
    【本市讯】市贸易公司于七月二十日举行了所属各单位干部人员统一大测验，参加者有市公司、百货分公司、煤铁分公司、花纱布分公司、信托分公司、长芦盐业分公司、粮食分公司、裕民山货栈等八个单位，共九百四十六人。
    测验内容是“七一”、“七七”党报所发表的各文件和毛主席、朱总司令在新政协筹备会上的讲词，共产党人发刊词等。进行方式是以学委支会为单位，利用早晨两小时的时间，早饭前交卷（由市公司学委会统一发测验题目）。在这次测验中，发现了干部中不少的糊涂观点。如长芦盐业分公司同志在答题中说：“中国革命过去需要国际帮助，现在有了大城市，能制造枪炮子弹了，所以不需要国际帮助了。”百货分公司一同志答道：“新旧政协是相同的”。
    经过这次测验，启发了干部的学习热情，打下了学习下一文件的基础。花纱布分公司经过测验的人，绝大部分对学习较前认真了。同时，测验卷子评好后，即发回各学习小组，进行了讨论，对各文件的精神已有较深一步的领会，有人反映说：测验比学习半月的成绩还大。很多人认为测验是督促学习的好办法，要求坚持这一制度。（市公司学委会）
