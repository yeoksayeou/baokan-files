    Spreading Experience and Learning Humbly
    Two Locomotives March South
    [From Our Newspaper] To adapt to the development of the nationwide victory situation and widely disseminate the experience of people's railway transportation, the "275" and "1129" locomotives of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot were ordered to go to the Zhengzhou Railway Administration. At noon on the 13th, a thousand employees went to the station to see them off. The "1501" locomotive crew shook hands and presented flowers to the southern brothers, and the employees' children performed Yangko dances to cheer them up. The director of the depot's trade union earnestly told them to "take care of your health." The secretary of the workers' committee encouraged them to "spread the experience of this place and humbly learn from the worker brothers in the South." After Depot Chief Xi introduced the exemplary deeds of the southern locomotive crews, he asked everyone to "guard against arrogance and create more achievements." Guo Dianrong, the driver of the 1129 locomotive who was promoted for his meritorious service, delivered a reply on behalf of the southern locomotive crews, saying, "Wherever we are needed, we will go there and resolutely serve the people to the end." He expressed his willingness to maintain close contact with brother locomotives forever. After the ceremony, amidst warm cheers and waving hats, the locomotives headed into the distance.

    传播经验虚心学习
    两台机车南征
    【本报讯】适应全国胜利形势的发展，广泛传播人民铁路运输经验，丰台机务段“二七五”、“一一二九”号机车，奉命开往郑州局。十三日中午，千名职工到车站欢送。“一五零一”号机车组，向南下兄弟一一握手献花，员工子弟演出秧歌助兴。段工会主任珍嘱“保重身体”。工委书记勉励“将此地的经验传播出去，虚心向南方的工人兄弟学习”。奚段长介绍南下机车组的模范事迹后，要求大家“力戒骄傲，再创成绩”。因为立功被提升的一一二九号机车司机长郭殿荣，代表南下机车组致答词，他说：“那里需要，就开到那里，坚决为人民服务到底。”表示愿与兄弟机车，永远保持密切联系。礼毕，在热烈的欢呼中，和帽子互挥中，机车向远方驶去。            （军）
