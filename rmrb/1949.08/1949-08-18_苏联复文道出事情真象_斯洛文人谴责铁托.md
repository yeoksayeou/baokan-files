Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: TASS reported on the 15th that the facts and documents cited in the Soviet government's note to the Yugoslav government have made a huge impression in the Slovenian-inhabited region of Carinthia. Participants in the Slovenian national liberation movement are deeply angered by the Tito clique's duplicity. Many Slovenians say that the Soviet government's reply has allowed them to see the truth of the matter. The people of Slovenian Carinthia are particularly annoyed by the fact that Yugoslavia launched a smear campaign against the decision of the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, intentionally spreading lies that the motion to abandon the demand for Slovenian Carinthia to be incorporated into Yugoslavia came from the Soviet Union, attempting to shift the blame onto others. In recent weeks, Yugoslav propaganda organs have distributed propaganda in Carinthia attacking the Soviet government for harming the interests of Slovenians in Carinthia. Slovenians point out that it is now completely clear that if anyone has harmed the interests of Slovenians in Carinthia, it is the current Yugoslav government.

　　苏联复文道出事情真象
  　斯洛文人谴责铁托
    【新华社北平十七日电】塔斯社十五日讯，据克拉根福特（斯洛文加林西亚中部）消息，苏联政府致南斯拉夫政府照会中所引证的事实和文件，在加林西亚的斯洛文族区域中造成巨大印象。斯洛文民族解放运动的参加者对铁托集团的两面行为深为愤怒。许多斯洛文人说，苏联政府的答复，使他们看到了事情的真相。斯洛文加林西亚的人民对下述事实特别恼怒：即南斯拉夫对巴黎外长会议决定发动了污蔑宣传，有意散播谎话说：放弃斯洛文加林西亚并入南斯拉夫的要求的动议是来自苏联的，企图把错误推到别人方面去。最近数周来，南斯拉夫宣传机关在加林西亚散发宣传品，攻击苏联政府危害加林西亚斯洛文人的利益。斯洛文人指出：目前已经完全清楚，若说有谁危害了加林西亚斯洛文人的利益，那就是目前的南斯拉夫政府。
