　　China's People's Power is Unprecedentedly Strong
    The American Imperialists' Arrogant Dreams are Doomed to Failure
  　Jinan Educational Figures Condemn White Paper
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 27th: Wang Zhusan, Vice Chairman of the Jinan City People's Representative Conference and a figure in educational circles, recently released a written statement regarding the American White Paper. He said: The White Paper shamefully admits the failure of American imperialism's plot of aggression, but they are still unwilling to accept it. Even today, they still support the remaining bandit gangs of the Kuomintang, making a last-ditch struggle. On the other hand, they still dream of using so-called "democratic individualism" to continue activities against the Chinese people. However, the strength of the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, has grown to an unprecedented level. This dream will be completely shattered, just like the first dream. We must unite with the world's people's democratic forces, led by the Soviet Union, to completely destroy China's reactionary forces and America's aggressive conspiracies. The preparatory committee of the Jinan Educational Workers Union also issued a written opinion on the White Paper, pointing out: American imperialism again wants to take advantage of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution by using so-called "democratic individualists" to create an opposition faction within the revolutionary ranks, attempting to sabotage the Chinese revolution. But the vast majority of liberals, who used to be scholarly and naïve, have awakened and transformed through the education, help, and reformation of the Communist Party and the People's Government. They want to follow the Communist Party and Mao Zedong, and not follow the reactionaries Chiang Kai-shek. They want to take the path of Wen Yiduo and Zhu Ziqing, who would rather fall than yield, and not take the shameless path of Hu Shih and Hu Shih who bowed their heads and begged for the crumbs of American imperialism.

　　中国人民力量空前强大
    美帝狂妄梦想必定失败
  　济南教育界人士斥白皮书
    【新华社济南二十七日电】济南市各界代表会副主席、教育界人士王祝三，顷发表对于美国白皮书的书面谈话，他说：白皮书可耻地供认了美帝国主义阴谋侵略的失败，但他仍不甘心，直至今天，他们仍支持国民党的残余匪帮，作垂死的挣扎；另方面还梦想着利用所谓“民主个人主义”者来继续进行反对中国人民的活动。可是中国人民力量在中国共产党领导下已空前壮大起来。这个梦必将和第一个梦一样地完全破灭。我们要联合以苏联为首的世界人民民主力量，彻底摧毁中国的反动势力及美国的侵略阴谋。济市教联筹备会亦就白皮书发表书面意见，指出：美帝又想在中国人民革命胜利中利用所谓“民主个人主义”者在革命阵营中制造反对派，企图破坏中国革命。但过去带有书生气的自由主义者，经过共产党和人民政府的教育、帮助和改造，绝大多数都觉醒了过来，转变了过来。他们要跟着共产党毛泽东走，而不跟反动派蒋介石走。他们要走闻一多、朱自清宁肯倒下去也不屈服的道路，不走胡适、傅斯年弯腰低头求食美帝国主义唾余的无耻道路。
