　　Connecting Domestic and Foreign Trade
  　The Luan River Water Transport Flourishes Daily
    Rehe Province is planning to dredge the river course, provide 10 million catties of grain as loans to help boatmen build boats, and will establish the Luan River Water Transport Company.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 21st] The Luan River water transport between Rehe and North China, which had been suspended for twelve years, has now been restored and is becoming increasingly smooth, becoming one of the important transportation lines connecting domestic and foreign trade. In the past six months, the amount of oil and salt imported from North China via the Luan River totaled 140,000 catties, and 700 barrels of gasoline; the exports to North China included 850,000 catties of millet, 270,000 catties of wool, and more than 100,000 catties of medicinal materials. The Luan River starts from Luanping in Rehe Province in the north (which can directly reach Chengde during the rainy season) and reaches Luan County in Hebei Province in the south, from where it can directly reach Tangshan and Tianjin via the Beining Railway, or reach the Bohai Sea via the Luan River estuary by waterway. Before the Anti-Japanese War, there were nearly 200 ships traveling on this 600-li river, each with a load capacity of 4,000 to 5,000 catties. Since the Japanese invaders occupied the area, water transport has been at a standstill. This spring, with the loans from the People's Government to boatmen for shipbuilding, and with the assistance of the North China Native Produce Company and Trading Company, shipping has only just recovered, and there are currently more than 100 ships. In order to strengthen the Luan River water transport, the Rehe Provincial People's Government is planning to dredge the river course, issue 10 million catties of autumn loan grain to help boatmen build 200 boats, and establish the Luan River Water Transport Company to organize transportation and vigorously develop urban and rural trade.

　　沟通关内外贸易
  　滦河水运日畅
    热省正计划修浚河道，贷粮千万斤帮助船民造船，并将建立滦河水运公司。
    【新华社承德二十一日电】停顿了十二年的热河与华北间的滦河水运，现已恢复并日趋通畅，成为沟通关内外贸易的重要运输线之一。半年以来，经滦河由华北地区输入的计有油盐十四万斤、汽油七百桶；向华北输出的有小米八十五万斤、羊毛二十七万斤、药材十万斤以上。滦河北起热河省之滦平（雨季可直通承德），南至河北省之滦县，由此可经北宁路直达唐山，天津，或由水路通往滦河口入渤海。抗战以前，在这六百里长的河道上，有近二百条船只来往，每只可载量四、五千斤。至日寇侵占以后，水运就一直陷于停顿状态。今春经人民政府贷款船户造船，并经华北土产公司和贸易公司协助，船运方始恢复，目前已共有百余船只。热河省人民政府为加强滦河水运，正计划修浚河道，发放秋季贷粮一千万斤，帮助船民造船二百只，并建立滦河水运公司，组织运输，大力发展城乡贸易。
