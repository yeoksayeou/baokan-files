Copper Coins (Part 2)
    Han Shutian

    Two

    The sun had just set when Tiger's dad returned. During dinner, Tiger kept looking at his dad, feeling that he wasn't quite as good as before, even though his dad's face was still as kind as ever.

    Tiger wanted to talk to his dad about the copper coins, but his dad didn't ask, and kept talking about other things, so Tiger didn't bring it up.

    The next day, his dad still didn't ask. At noon, Tiger went to check on the copper coins, and they were still lying there safely.

    Another day passed. As soon as Tiger walked into the house after school, his dad asked him:

    "Tiger, did you take something?"

    Tiger was taken aback by the sudden question and didn't know how to answer, only asking back, "What thing?"

    "You know what thing!" his dad said, already sure that he had taken it.

    Tiger didn't answer immediately.

    "Take it out quickly. If you didn't take it, would the copper coins grow wings and fly away?" His dad was angry, his voice quite loud.

    "Copper coins?" Tiger understood completely. He then said, "I took the copper coins!"

    "I knew it was you who took them. Who told you to take them?"

    Tiger said slowly, "Those are public copper coins!"

    As soon as "public" was mentioned, Tiger's dad seemed to feel that he had done something wrong, and didn't immediately shout loudly. He also said relatively slowly, "You still can't take public things!"

    "I wanted to give them to the public."

    His dad didn't speak…

    After a while, his dad said that it was okay to return them to the public. He just told him to take them out first.

    After saying that, Tiger ran to find the copper coins.

    Tiger ran to the base of the slope where he had hidden the copper coins. When he got there, he first looked for the marker—the branch.

    Oh! The branch is gone!

    Luckily, Tiger recognized the rock. He flipped the rock over with all his might. Oh! There's nothing there!

    Tiger flipped over a few more rocks in a row, but still no copper coins.

    Tiger was so anxious that his face turned red, and he was about to cry!

    He flipped over a few more rocks, but still nothing.

    Tiger "thumped" and sat on the ground, tears streaming down…

    Uncle Ma was working in the field when he saw Tiger. Seeing the child crying, he asked him why. He didn't say anything. Uncle Ma wiped his tears and tried to comfort him: "Who bullied you, Tiger? Don't cry, Uncle will hit them."

    Tiger couldn't find his copper coins, so he had to go back.

    Tiger didn't go home. He went straight to the school, stayed in the classroom for a while, and then went to find the teacher.

    "Teacher, I made a mistake!" He said sadly as he entered the teacher's room.

    Tiger was usually a good child, so what mistake did he make this time? The teacher was really stunned.

    "Tiger, what's your mistake?" the teacher asked.

    Tiger shed tears again.

    "Don't cry, Tiger, tell the teacher what's wrong."

    "I—I lost the pub—public—copper—coins." Tiger said, crying.

    The teacher couldn't figure it out for a moment. What public copper coins? And how were they lost?

    Tiger was so upset right now that it wasn't good to ask any more questions. So, the teacher first comforted him and told him not to cry.

    After Tiger stopped crying, the teacher finally understood what was going on.

    The teacher said, "Good child! Don't be upset. This doesn't count as your mistake. If the copper coins are lost, let's look for them. If we can't find them, we'll think of another way."

    That afternoon, Teacher Liu had something else to do and went to the village office. When he reached the crossroads, he saw a crowd of people gathered in front of the blackboard newspaper, so he squeezed in as well.

    The first piece of news on the blackboard newspaper was: "Hu Sanxiao picked up money and didn't pocket it, worthy of praise." Below it was written: "Shepherd boy Hu Sanxiao picked up sixty-two copper coins yesterday afternoon and handed them over to the village office. If they belong to anyone in our village, please come and claim them." Below that were a few words of praise, and all the children in the village were asked to learn from him.

    Yesterday afternoon, Hu Sanxiao was herding his sheep and walking back from the base of the slope where the copper coins were hidden. One of the sheep accidentally kicked over the rock, and the copper coins were exposed.

    Sanxiao cursed "White Neck" (Note 3), bent down and picked up a stone to throw at it. He bent down again, preparing to pick up another one. Haha! Such a large pile of copper coins!

    Sanxiao collected the copper coins and counted them. There were sixty-two in total. Who did these copper coins belong to? He wasn't sure, but no matter who they belonged to, he would hand them over to the village office and let the owner come and claim them.

    When he returned to the village, he penned up the sheep and handed over the copper coins to the village office.

    After reading the blackboard newspaper, Teacher Liu happily went to find Tiger. As soon as he saw Tiger, he hurriedly said, "Tiger, the copper coins have been found!"

    "Where are they?"

    "Come on, come with me to get them."

    Tiger didn't say anything else and followed the teacher out the door. They went to the village office together.

    They told the grain and forage committee member, who was planning to use the abacus, what had happened. The grain and forage committee member asked, "Are these your copper coins?"

    "No, they are public." Tiger replied.

    Then Teacher Liu explained the whole story.

    Tiger thought for a moment, and then said, "Let's hand these copper coins over to the grain and forage committee member and ask him to forward them to the factory."

    The grain and forage committee member said "Very good," and took the copper coins. He told Tiger that he would definitely send them to the factory. He also praised Tiger greatly, saying that he would be praised on the blackboard newspaper!

    Teacher Liu had something to do and had to wait for the village chief to come, so he stayed at the village office.

    Tiger went to find Sanxiao…

    Note 1: "Dalianzi" - a type of bag woven with thread that farmers in the countryside often use to hold things, with the opening in the middle, which can be slung over the shoulder.

    Note 2: "Public" - refers to the meaning of the state, and the old liberated areas are accustomed to calling it the public.

　　铜元（下）

    太阳刚落山，虎儿爹回来了。吃晚饭的时候，虎儿不断的瞅他爹，总觉着不如以前好，虽说爹的脸还是象以前那样和善。
    虎儿想跟爹说说关于铜元的事，可是爹没有问起，老谈别的，虎儿也就没有主动的谈。
    第二天，爹还是没有问起。晌午，虎儿去看铜元，它们还平安的在那儿躺着。
    又过了一天，散了中午学，虎儿从学校刚走进家门，他爹就问他：
    “虎子，你拿什么东西了没有？”
    虎儿被猛然一问，不知回答什么，只反问了一句：“什么东西？”
    “什么东西你还不知道！”他爹已经肯定他拿了似的说。
    虎儿没有立刻回答。
    “快拿出来，不是你拿，铜元还能长上翅膀飞了？”他爹生气了，声音挺高。
    “铜元？”虎儿完全明白了，他接着说：“铜元是我拿啦！”
    “我知道就是你拿啦，谁叫你拿？”
    虎儿慢吞吞的说：“那是公家的铜元！”
    一提到“公家”，虎儿爹象感到自己作错了似的，没有即刻大声嚷。也比较慢吞吞的说：“公家的你也不能拿呀！”
    “我想送给公家。”
    他爹不说话了……
    停了一会儿，他爹说送还公家也可以。只是叫他先拿出来。
    说完，虎儿跑去找铜元去了。
    虎儿跑到藏铜元的那个坡根底，到了那里先找那个记号——树枝子。
    呀！树枝子不见啦！
    还好，虎儿认得那块石头，使劲把石头一翻，呀！啥也没有！
    虎儿一连又翻了几块，还是不见铜元。
    虎儿急得脸红了，要哭了！
    他又翻了几块石头，还是啥也没有。
    虎儿“扑嗵”坐到地下，流出了眼泪……
    马大伯下地，碰到虎儿，见这孩子在哭，问他为什么？他没有说。马大伯给他擦了擦眼泪，劝着他：“谁欺负你啦，虎子？别哭啦，大伯打他。”
    虎儿的铜元找不到了，只好往回走。
    虎儿没有回家，他一直走到学校里，在教室里呆了一会，去找老师去了。
    “老师，我犯了错误！”进了老师的屋子，他伤心的说。
    虎儿平常是个好孩子，这次有什么错误呢？真把老师给楞住了。
    “虎子，你有什么错误？”老师问。
    虎儿又流出了眼泪。
    “别哭，虎子，有什么，你跟老师说。”
    “我—我把公—家—家的—铜元—元丢—丢了。”虎儿哭着说。
    老师一时摸不着头绪，什么公家的铜元？怎么又丢了？
    现在虎儿这么难受，也不好再问。于是，老师先劝他别哭。
    虎儿停了哭以后，老师才问明白了是怎么回事。
    老师说：“好孩子！别难受。这也不算你的什么错误。铜元丢了，咱们找一找，要是找不到再想办法。”
    　　　　三
    当天下午，刘老师有点别的事到村公所去走一趟。走到十字路口，看到黑板报跟前挤着一堆人，他也挤上去。
    黑板报的第一条消息是：“胡三小拾金不昧，值得表扬。”下面写着：“放羊娃胡三小昨天下午拾到铜元六十二枚，缴到村公所。是咱村谁的，请来领取。”再下面就是表扬的几句话，并且要全村儿童向他学习。
    胡三小昨天下午赶着他的羊，从藏铜元那个坡底往回走，不知哪只羊把那块石头蹬翻了，铜元露出来了。
    三小子骂了一声白脖子（注三），弯下腰捡起一块石头扔过去。又弯下腰，准备再捡一块。哈哈！这么一大堆铜元！
    三小子把铜元收拾起，数了数，一共六十二个。这铜元是谁的？他摸不清，管他是谁的呢，缴到村公所叫人家自己来领吧。
    回到村里，把羊圈好，就把铜元缴到村公所了。
    刘老师看过黑板报以后高兴地去找虎儿。一见虎儿就急忙说：“虎子，铜元找到啦！”
    “在哪里？”
    “走，跟我去拿。”
    虎儿再没说什么，跟着老师跑出大门。一块到了村公所。
    他们把情形告诉正在打算盘子的粮秣委员。粮秣委员问：“是你的铜元？”
    “不是，是公家的。”虎儿回答说。
    接着由刘老师把经过的情形讲了讲。
    虎儿一想，然后说：“就把这铜元缴给粮秣委员吧，叫他转送给工厂。”
    粮秣委员说“很好”，就把铜元收下了。告诉虎子说：一定送到工厂。而且对虎子大大的夸奖了一顿。说要在黑板报上好好表扬表扬！
    刘老师有事要等村长来，所以留到村公所。
    虎儿去找三小子去了……。
    注一：“褡连子”——乡下农民常用它装东西的一种用线织成的袋子，口在当中，可以搭在肩膀上。
    注二：“公家”——就是指国家的意思，老解放区都习惯叫公家。
    注三：“白脖子”——是放羊娃给羊起的名字。
