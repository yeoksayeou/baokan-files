Prospects for the Datong Coal Mine
　　Lin Wei

The renowned Datong Coal Mine, one of the most famous in Asia and the world, now has a production far from that of the Japanese puppet regime, but from its inherent meaning, it has undergone a fundamental change. From the day of liberation, the Datong Coal Mine has been forever free from the control of warlords, bureaucrats, and imperialists. From now on, it will forever be owned by the people and make the greatest contribution to the construction of a new democratic China's industry.

Possessing rich reserves and extremely good quality are the greatest characteristics of the Datong Coal Mine over ordinary mines. The Datong Coalfield is located 40 miles southwest of Datong, running from the western edge of the Datong Plain, vertically through the plateau area west of the Kouquan Mountains, spanning Datong, Zuoyun, Huairen, Youyu, Shuoxian, and Pinglu six counties, with a north-east to south-west length of about 110 kilometers, and a north-west to south-east average width of about 25 kilometers, covering an area of 2,750 square kilometers. The coal seam is formed by two major coal-bearing layers, the Jurassic and Permian Carboniferous layers. The Jurassic layer has seven layers, and the Carboniferous layer has four layers, totaling eleven layers. The most valuable for mining are five to six coal layers, with a thickness of 1.5 to 6.5 meters, and the thickest reaching 20 meters. Between each layer, there are 30 to 50 meters of sandstone and shale layers in between, which provides extremely convenient and favorable conditions for using vertical shafts for coal mining. In 1943, the Japanese, Hinoko Morita, investigated and predicted that the reserves reached 40 billion tons. If this number is the basis, according to the peak period of machine mining during the Japanese puppet regime, with a daily output of 13,718 tons and an annual output of 5 million tons, it would take 8,000 years to mine. In addition to the above-mentioned rich reserves, the Datong Coalfield also has extremely good coal quality. It is an excellent steelmaking coal. The upper part of the coalfield belongs to the Jurassic layer, with hundreds of millions of tons, is highly bituminous coal, with extremely strong firepower, long ignition duration, and low ash content, making it ideal for boilers and ship coal. The coal layer is about six meters thick, and the interbedded stone in the layer is very rare. The lower part belongs to Permian Carboniferous, with reserves of 30 billion tons, is coking bituminous coal. The coal layer contains excellent refractory materials, with a fire resistance of SK 35 to 40. Highly bituminous coal contains 3.0% moisture, 2.34% ash, 26.29% volatile matter, 68.31% fixed carbon, 0.37% sulfur, and a calorific value of 7,700 kcal. Each kilogram of coking bituminous coal contains 3.04% moisture, 8.94% ash, 36.02% volatile matter, 52.00% fixed carbon, 0.38% sulfur, and a calorific value of 7,170 kcal per kilogram. Japan was highly concerned about the low ash content of Datong coal, and tried many methods to conduct various coal blending and coking research. The experimental results were the best when using a mixture of 50% strong coking coal from Zhongxing, Kailuan, and Jingxing, and 50% Datong coal. In 1940, the Yawata Iron Works in Japan conducted blast furnace experiments, and the results showed that the ash content of coke using Datong coal was reduced by about 3%, and the iron output was increased by about 10%. The iron produced using coke with low ash content was also very excellent. All of this provides extremely good conditions for our construction of a new democratic industry.

The coal in the Datong Coalfield has been in the coalfield area since ancient times. Before 1918, all the small kilns used local methods for mining, and their output could only supply local fuel. In 1918 and 1920, Yan Bandit Baojin Branch Company and Tongbao Company were established respectively, and began to prepare for machine mining, but due to poor management, they stopped work in 1922. In 1924, Baoheng Branch Company was established, using extremely simple machines to mine at Baituyao, with a daily output of dozens of tons. In 1925, Xinzhou Kiln No. 1 and No. 2 vertical shafts of Baojin Branch Company were drilled, machines were installed, and steam power was used for mining. By 1936, the highest record of output was 265,000 tons.

In November 1937, after Japan occupied Datong, it immediately entrusted the Datong Coal Mine to the Mantetsu Fushun Coal Mine to take over. In February of the following year, the Datong Coal Mine Co., Ltd. was established. Before and after the occupation, Japan paid great attention to the Datong Coal Mine, regarding the Datong Coalfield as the heat source of East Asia, and in its fuel national policy, regarded the plunder of the Datong Coal Mine as an essential part of economic construction. Therefore, after the occupation, it immediately planned a vast plunder plan. First of all, it started to build the Yanling Power Plant, changing the steam power mining during the Yan Bandit's rule to electric power mining. However, due to the old machines, the water hardness was too high, and the power supply was insufficient, so it built a large-scale Pingwang Power Plant. At this time, the coal mine also gradually developed from the four mines during the Yan Bandit's rule (Xinzhou Kiln of Baojin Coal Mine, Jinbei Mining Bureau, Tongbao Coal Mine, Baoheng Coal Mine) into eight mines, hence the name of the Eight Major Mines of Kouquan. The eight major mines include: Baojin Mine, Meiyukou Mine, Yongdingzhuang Mine, Baituyao Mine, Baidong Mine, Sandaogou Mine, Tongjialiang Mine, and Silaogou Mine, with more than 15,000 coal miners, plus more than 20,000 off-pit workers and staff, with an average daily output of 6,000-8,000 tons. According to the survey of the scheduled and actual coal production from April 1944 to January of the following year by Japan, the original plan was to produce 2,546,900 tons of coal in ten months, but the actual output was only 2,000,000 tons, with an average daily output of 6,501 tons. The highest monthly output of the largest Baidong Coal Mine was 53,088 tons in July 1944. According to the investigation of the Datong Coal Mine Mining Office in September 1942, the highest record during the peak period of machine mining in Datong Coal Mine was 13,718 tons per day.

Under the general plan of large-scale plunder of the Datong Coal Mine, and while installing modern machines and solving the mining power, Japan paid great attention to the traffic problem. In order to facilitate plunder, it built Kouquan, a branch line of Tong (Datong) and Kou (Quan), into a Class B station. The mining area was specially equipped with three locomotives, responsible for transporting coal to Kouquan. From 1941 to 1944, Kouquan Station transported an average of 12-15 trains of coal (including private coal kilns) to the outside every day. In 1944, the output of coal was 2,000,000 tons in ten months. The coal output to Manchuria and Korea reached 222,636 tons, military coal 261,042 tons, shipping coal 19,368 tons, civilian use: 26,529 tons outside the area, 407,012 tons inside the area, railway: 350,966 tons inside the area, 300,457 tons outside the area, electricity industry 100,142 tons. In addition, 234,338 tons were used for ironmaking in the area. The actual output in ten months was 1,922,596 tons, and the output outside the area accounted for 52%, that is, 1,000,000 tons. From 1937 to July 1943, Japan plundered 8,947,051 tons from Datong Coal in seven years (most of which were transported to Japan, Manchuria, and Korea). In 1944, Japan planned to expand the Datong Coal Mine to an annual output of 5,000,000 tons. In order to solve the difficulty of plunder transportation, it specially planned to build the Tong-Tang (Gugu) Railway around Badaling. All of this shows how ambitious Japanese imperialism was to plunder the Datong Coalfield. However, Japan had long suffered from frequent power accidents, and the difficulty of data could not be solved, especially the lack of labor. During the Japanese puppet regime, the miners were composed of four parts: local semi-farmers and semi-workers, recruited and deceived from other places, and the common people and prisoners of war captured during the sweeping of our base areas (workers outside the area accounted for 60%). The ordinary miners lived the hardest life. One or two hundred people were locked in a large room, surrounded by barbed wire, and had no freedom of movement. In addition, they were not used to the water, soil, and climate, resulting in a large number of deaths. In eight years, more than 10,000 miners died. There were mass graves in every mine, and the corpses are still everywhere next to the mass graves, which is horrifying. There is also a more cruel way to control workers, which is to give them drugs, resulting in 60% of the 15,000 miners addicted to opium.

In 1946, after the Kuomintang reactionaries provoked the civil war, the Datong Coal Mine was damaged, causing all machine production to stop. In February and May of this year, after our army successively liberated Kouquan and Datong, under the clear policy of the people's government to restore and develop production, the Datong Coal Mine immediately began to resume work. In order to quickly restore coal mine production, a staff training class was held in April, and in late May, the takeover team specially held a meeting of more than 30 employee representatives from the mining area to widely solicit the opinions of employee representatives on restoring coal mine production. At the meeting, the representatives, in the attitude of masters, put forward 20 opinions on the restoration work, and severely criticized the leadership for the lack of planning in the restoration work. The leadership immediately accepted the representatives' opinions and strengthened the leadership and planning, so that the number of technicians increased from 13 in May to 188. Significant results were achieved in the 23 days of June. Now all the machinists are working hard to install machines and quickly restore the machine production of No. 1 well (estimated to be completed on August 1). Under the extremely lack of tools and raw materials, the workers have shown a high degree of enthusiasm. Some work overtime, some sacrifice their naps, and some try to use scrap iron. Mechanic Mi Shutian found a copper skateboard, which was buried for more than ten years, from the pile of scrap iron and was indispensable for the operation of the high car. Wang Dequan, the leader of the ironworking team, automatically borrowed a bellows from the outside to solve the difficulty of tools, and developed from one furnace to four furnaces in one month. The leaders have begun to tell the workers about the mine's situation and plans, and discuss with the workers. Now the mine workers are full of new atmosphere. At present, although there are only more than 1,400 miners in the entire mining area, with a daily output of 360 tons, from its fundamental meaning, the Datong Coal Mine is moving towards a bright road.

However, since the Datong Coal Mine has not been liberated for a long time, several serious problems left over from history have not yet been resolved, which need to be paid high attention by the leaders, and solved according to the actual situation in terms of importance, priority, slowness, and urgency.

1.  The development of the mining area is not unified. The lack of unified development of the mining area is manifested through the two forms of public and private operation. According to the inaccurate statistics of the Datong northern coalfield, there are four units: JinSui, Huairen, Zuoyun, and Datong Military Control Commission Enterprise Takeover Team. Due to the lack of unified leadership, the development and operation also showed the same lack of unity. Some purely operate for the purpose of not starting from a long-term construction point of view, but from a purely profit point of view, and therefore, it is very harmful to the restoration of large-scale machine mining. In the private sector, it is still stuck in the state of random excavation decades ago. Only in the small area of 1,600 square miles from Yungang in the north to Changliushui in the south, and from Majialong in the west to Kouquan in the east, there are 81 private coal kilns, and more than 30 are currently being developed. Their purpose is only to eat coal nearby, and how to make money is how to do it. Therefore, it is very destructive to our long-term development and construction of coal mine production, which requires the leadership to quickly resolve.

2.  At present, the production of Datong Coal Mine is seriously in short supply because machine mining has not yet been restored. The PingSui Railway alone needs 24,000 tons per month, while the coal mine can only produce 9,000 tons per month in the current situation. The objective situation urgently requires the leaders to greatly strengthen the leadership of the Datong Coal Mine. In this stage, due to inconsistent steps and untimely problem solving, there is a serious lack of careful planning. Others are manifested in the untimely resolution of urgent materials, and many departments cannot exert their due work effectiveness due to lack of materials.

3.  The coal mine fire is serious and needs to be treated. At present, there are five places in the northern coalfield of Datong that have suffered fire disasters: Kouquan West Mountain, Majiliang, Tongjialiang, Baituyao, and Daxiyao. Most of them are caused by carelessness. The fire time is generally one to two years, and the longest one, such as Kouquan West Mountain, has been burning since the eighth year of the Republic of China, and has not been extinguished for 30 years. Except for the Tongjialiang fire, which has been closed, no one else is managing it. This serious fire disaster deserves our high attention, actively conducting research and trying to treat it, otherwise, the losses it will give us will not be able to be counted by numbers.

    大同炭矿展望
    林巍
    驰名遐迩为亚洲有数的世界闻名之大同炭矿，现在产量虽距日伪统治时期相差很远，但从其内在意义上说，已起了根本的变化。从解放之日起，大同炭矿已永远摆脱了军阀、官僚、帝国主义的掌握，从此，将永远为人民所有，并为建设新民主主义中国的工业而尽最大供献。
    拥有丰富的蕴藏量和极为良好的质量，是大同炭矿超于一般矿山之最大特点，大同炭田位于大同西南四十里处，从大同平野西缘，纵贯口泉山脉以西之高原地带，跨大同、左云，怀仁、右玉、朔县、平鲁六县，北东——南西长约一一○公里，北西——南东平均宽度约二十五公里，面积二七五○平方公里，炭层是由侏罗纪层和二叠炭纪层两大含炭层所长成，侏罗纪层七层，石炭纪层四层，共十一层，开采最有价值者为五——六层炭层，厚度由１．５—６．５米，最厚者达二十米，在各层之间有３０—５０米的砂岩和页岩层介在中间，这对于用竖井采炭提供了极为方便的有利条件。一九四三年日本人森田日子次调查，预想埋藏量达四○○亿吨。如以此数为根基，按日伪统治时，机器开采拨萃时期日产一三、七一八吨，年产五○○万吨计算，得须开采八○○○年。大同炭田除拥有以上丰富的埋藏量以外，炭质也极为良好，它是优秀的炼钢用炭。炭田的上部是属侏罗纪层，拥有百亿吨，是高度沥青炭，火力极强，引火持续时间长，灰分少，是理想的锅炉及轮船用炭。炭层厚约六米，层中夹石很稀，下部是属二叠纪炭，埋藏达三○○亿吨，是粘结性沥青炭，在炭层中含有优秀的耐火材料，有Ｓ，Ｋ三五号至四十号之耐火度。高度沥青炭含有水分三·○％，灰分二·三四％，发挥分二六·二九％，固定炭素六八·三一％，硫磺○·三七％，发热度七·七○○大卡。每公斤粘结性沥青炭含有水分三·○四％，灰分八·九四％，挥发分三六·○二％，固定炭素五二·○○％，硫磺○·三八％，发热量七、一七○大卡每公斤，对于大同炭的灰分少，日本曾引起高度注目，想许多方法，进行各种煤炭配合炼焦的研究，并以中兴、开滦、井陉的强粘结性炭和大同炭的各五○％的混合煤所炼焦炭，试验结果最为良好。一九四○年，日本八幡制铁所施行高炉试验结果，配用大同炭的焦炭，灰分减少约三％，出铣量约增加一○％，使用灰分少的焦炭，炼出来的铁质亦很优秀。这一切都给我们建设新民主主义工业提供了极为良好的条件。
    大同炭田的石炭，很古就有炭田区域，一九一八年前各小窑都是利用土法采掘，其产量只能供给当地燃料，一九一八年和一九二○年，阎匪保晋分公司，同保公司分别成立，开始筹办用机器采掘，但因经营不良，一九二二年即行停工，一九二四年宝恒分公司成立，在白土窑用极简单之机器开采，日产数十吨，一九二五年保晋分公司忻州窑一二号直井凿成，按设机器，使用汽力开采，至一九三六年产量最高纪录二六五、○○○吨。
    一九三七年十一月，日本侵占大同后，把大同炭矿立即委嘱于满铁抚顺炭矿接收，翌年二月成立了大同炭矿株式会社。在侵占前和侵占后，日本对于大同炭矿非常注目，把大同炭田视为东亚热源，更在它的燃料国策中，把掠夺大同炭矿视为经济建设中的要件。因而，在侵占后，立即筹划了广大的掠夺计划。首先着手建立了岩岭发电厂，变阎匪统治时期的汽力开采为电力开采。但由于机器破旧，用水硬度太大，供电不足，遂又建筑了规模宏大的平旺发电厂。这时，炭矿亦逐渐由阎匪统治时期的四矿（保晋煤矿之忻州窑，晋北矿务局，同保煤矿，保恒煤矿），发展成八个矿，故有口泉八大矿之称。八大矿包括：保晋矿、煤峪口矿、永定庄矿、白土窑矿、白洞矿、三道沟矿、同家梁矿、四老沟矿、拥有采炭工一五○○○余人，连坑外工人职员共二○○○○余人，平均日产六○○○——八○○○吨。按日本一九四四年四月至第二年一月出炭预定与实际情况调查，原预定十个月出炭二、五四六、九○○吨，实际出炭，仅二、○○○、○○○吨，平均日产六五○一吨，最大的白洞炭矿一九四四年七月最高月产五三、○八八吨，据一九四二年大同炭矿矿务处九月份调查，大同炭矿机器拔萃时期的最高纪录为日产一三、七一八吨。
    日本在对大同炭矿大掠夺的总计划下，和按装现代化机器与解决开采动力的同时，日本对交通问题更是非常注意，为便利掠夺，把同（大同）、口（泉）支路的口泉建为乙等车站，矿区专门设有三辆机车，负责向口泉运炭，从一九四一年，至一九四四年，口泉车站平均每日向外输炭一二——一五列车（包括私营炭窑在内），一九四四年十个月产炭二、○○○、○○○吨，石炭输出，仅对满、鲜即达二二二、六三六吨，军用炭二六一、○四二吨，输船用一九、三六八吨，民用：地区外二六、五二九吨，地区内四○七、○一二吨，铁路：地区内三五○、九六六吨，地区外三○○、四五七吨，电业一○○、一四二吨，另外，地区内制铁等用二三四、三三八吨，十个月实输出一、九二二、五九六吨，地区外输出占五二％，即一、○○○、○○○吨。从一九三七年至一九四三年七月止，七年中日本从大同炭出掠夺了八、九四七、○五一吨（其中大部运到日、满、鲜）。一九四四年日本更计划把大同炭矿扩大为年产五、○○○万吨，为解决掠夺运输困难，专门计划绕过八达岭修建同、塘（沽）铁路，这一切的一切都说明了日本帝国主义，对于大同炭田掠夺野心如何之大。但日本曾长时期苦恼于电力事故之经常发生，资料困难无法解决，尤其劳动力不足。在日伪统治时期矿工是由本地半农半工，外地招募和欺骗，扫荡我根据地时，抓来的老百姓和战俘四部分人组成（地区外工人占六○％），矿工中以普通矿工生活最苦，一二百人被关在一所大房中，外边围有铁丝网，行动毫无自由，再加水土、气候不惯，造成大批死亡，八年中，死亡矿工万余人，在每一矿上都有万人坑，至今万人坑旁尸骨遍是，其情景令人毛骨悚然，还有统治工人更残酷的方法是发给毒品，致造成一万五千矿工中，吸食鸦片者占六○％。
    一九四六年，国民党反动派挑起内战后，大同炭矿遭受了破坏，致使机器生产全部停顿，今年二月和五月，我军先后解放口泉、大同后，在人民政府明确的恢复和发展生产的方针下，大同炭矿立即开始恢复工作，为迅速恢复炭矿生产，于四月间召开了职工训练班，五月下旬接管组专门召开了三十余名矿区职工代表会议，广泛征求职工代表对恢复炭矿生产之意见，会议中代表以主人翁的姿态，提出有关恢复工作意见二十条、并对领导上在恢复工作方面缺乏计划性，进行了严正的批评，领导当即接受代表意见，加强了领导和计划，因而使技工由五月份的十三人增到一八八人，在六月的二十三天中获得显著成绩，现在全体机工正为按装机器迅速恢复一号井机器生产（估计在八月一日完成）而努力。在工具原料极端缺乏的条件下，工人发挥了高度的积极性，有的加班，有的牺牲午睡，有的设法利用废铁，机工米树田从烂铁堆里，找出了埋藏十余年高车开工不可缺少的铜滑板，铁工组长王德全为解决工具困难自动从外处借风箱，一个月中由一盘炉发展成了四盘炉，领导上已开始把矿方情况和计划告诉工人，并和工人商量。现在矿中职工充满着新生气象。目前全部矿区虽仅有千四百余矿工，日产三六○吨的数字，但从其根本意义上说，大同炭矿正向康庄大道迈进。
    但大同炭矿由于解放不久，过去从历史上遗留下来的几个严重问题，现在尚未获得解决，需引起领导上高度注意，并根据实际情况分别重、次、缓、急予以解决。
    一、矿区开发不统一。矿区开发不统一是通过公营和私营两种形式表现的，只根据大同北部炭田不精确统计，公营者有晋绥、怀仁、左云和大同军管会企业接管组四个单位，由于领导不统一，在开展和经营上也同样表现了不统一，有些单纯经营目的并非从长远建设观点出发，而是从单纯获利观点出发，因而，对恢复大规模机器开采危害甚大。在私营方面仍停留在数十年前乱掘状态，只据北起云岗，南至常流水，西起马家ｌàｎｇ＠①，东至口泉一千六百平方华里的狭小地区内，就有私营炭窑八一处，现在开发者三十处以上，他们的目的只是就近吃炭，如何赚钱就如何办，因此对我长远发展与建设炭矿生产破坏性很大，这就需要领导上迅速解决。
    二、目前大同炭矿生产，由于机器采炭尚未恢复，所以表现了严重的供不应求。仅平绥铁路一个单位一月需要二四○○○吨，而炭矿就目前情况仅能月产九○○○吨，客观情况迫切要求领导上大力加强对大同炭矿的领导。在这一阶段中，由于步调不一，解决问题不及时，严重的缺乏周密计划性。其他表现在急用材料解决不及时，好多部门因缺乏材料而不能发挥应有的工作效力。
    三、炭矿火灾严重，尚需设法医治。目前大同北部炭田遭火灾者有口泉西山、马脊梁、同家梁、白土窑、大西窑五处，大部是由不慎而引起的，火灾时间一般已有一年至两年的，长者如口泉西山是由民国八年起，至今三十年尚未熄灭，现除同家梁火灾已进行封闭外其他尚无人管理。此一严重火灾实值得引起我们高度注意，积极进行研究设法医治，不然，所给我们的损失将不是数字所能统计的。
