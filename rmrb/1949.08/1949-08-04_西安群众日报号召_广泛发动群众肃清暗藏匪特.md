    Xi'an Masses Daily Calls for
    Broad Mobilization of the Masses to Eliminate Hidden Bandits and Special Agents
    [This newspaper, Xi'an news] After the liberation of Xi'an, the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan bandit chieftains pre-planned and deployed hidden bandits and special agents who used spreading rumors, spying on intelligence, organizing robbery and assassination, and disrupting financial trade and other evil activities to disrupt social order and hinder and destroy the restoration and development of urban production. The Xi'an Masses Daily recently published an editorial entitled "Mobilize the Masses to Thoroughly Eliminate Bandits and Special Agents," calling on hundreds of thousands of people and cadres in Xi'an to rise up and fight against enemies who do not carry guns or secretly carry guns. The editorial pointed out that the struggle against enemy agents in the past two months has achieved initial victory. The main shortcomings in the struggle are that the suppression of stubborn ringleaders in the implementation of the lenient policy has not been implemented enough; and the masses have not been widely mobilized to participate in this struggle. How to correctly handle these two issues is the key to eliminating bandits and special agents in the future. The editorial also pointed out that public security work, like other work carried out by our party, must mobilize and organize the broad masses to participate in this struggle in order to achieve victory, because the hidden enemies' counter-revolutionary activities are hidden in front of a few public security personnel, but they cannot be hidden in front of the broad masses. Therefore, only by trying every means to publicize and organize the masses to actively participate in this struggle can the purpose of eliminating bandits and special agents be achieved.
    [Also reported] The work group of the first sub-bureau of the public security bureau in the first district has gained preliminary experience in organizing the masses to carry out the special suppression movement in the seventh Bao. The work group regularly and universally approached the masses, understood the residents' situation, publicized the victorious situation of our army and the power of the people, relied on the masses to find solutions, promptly reported and cracked bandit and special agent cases, educated residents, improved the masses' confidence in reporting bandits and special agents, and carried out relief grain distribution and other work in coordination, and gradually established public security organizations among the masses. After a long period of publicity and factual education on case solving, the masses' enthusiasm for eliminating bandits and special agents gradually increased. They came up with many ways to eliminate special agents: For example, it was proposed that landlords should be responsible for reviewing tenants' household registration in advance, and landlords should introduce them to the public security bureau for registration. This changed the past phenomenon that tenants directly registered with the public security bureau, which made it easy for bad people to take advantage of loopholes. The masses also came up with many ways to connect with the public security organs for bandits and special agents who falsely borrowed the name of the military control commission to impersonate inspections. They also studied various methods of assisting each other and immediately reporting to the police once a bandit alarm occurred. Children also automatically proposed to organize children's teams to help adults patrol at night and check for bad people. Now the broad masses' movement to eliminate special agents is unfolding in the city.

    西安群众日报号召
    广泛发动群众肃清暗藏匪特
    【本报西安讯】西安市解放后，经蒋胡匪首预先有计划布置下的潜藏匪特，用散播谣言、刺探情报、组织抢劫暗杀、捣乱金融贸易等罪恶活动，扰乱社会治安，阻碍和破坏城市生产的恢复和发展。西安群众日报日前特以“动员群众彻底肃清匪特”为题，发表社论，号召西安市几十万群众与干部，起来与不拿枪或暗中拿枪的敌人作战。社论指出过去两月对敌特的斗争，已取得初步胜利。在斗争中的主要缺点是在执行宽大政策中对于顽抗的首恶分子的镇压方面，还执行得不够；及尚未广泛发动群众参加这一斗争。而如何正确处理这两个问题，为今后肃清匪特的关键。社论又指出治安工作和我党所进行的其他工作一样，要取得胜利，必须发动和组织广大群众来参加这一斗争，因暗藏的敌人，在少数治安人员面前，其反革命活动是隐蔽的，但在广大群众面前他们就无法隐藏，因此只有想尽一切办法宣传与组织群众来积极参加这一斗争，肃清匪特才能达到目的。
    【又讯】该市一区公安一分局分驻所工作组在七保已取得组织群众开展肃特运动的初步经验。该工作组经常普遍的接近群众，了解居民情况，宣传我军胜利形势和人民力量，依靠群众想办法，及时检举破获匪特案件教育居民  提高群众检举匪特信心，并和发救济粮等其他工作配合进行，逐步在群众中建立起治安组织。经过较长久的宣传及破案的事实教育，群众肃清匪特的情绪逐渐高涨。他们想了许多肃特办法：如提议房客登记户口，必须房东事前负责审查，并由房东介绍到公安局登记。改变过去房客直接到公安局登记，坏人易钻空子的现象。对假借军管会名义冒名检查的匪特，群众也想出了许多与公安机关接应的办法。并研究出一旦发生匪警互相协助即刻报警的各种方法。儿童们也自动提议组织儿童队，帮助大人查夜、查坏人。现广大群众的肃特运动，正在该市展开。
