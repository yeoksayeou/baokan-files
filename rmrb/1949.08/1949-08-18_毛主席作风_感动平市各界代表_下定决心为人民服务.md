　　Chairman Mao's Style
  　Touches Representatives from All Circles in Beiping
    Resolving to Serve the People
    [Beiping News] Representatives attending the Beiping All-Circles Representative Conference have recently been discussing the achievements of the conference and disseminating its spirit to people from all walks of life. They particularly praised the speech of the Chinese people's leader, Chairman Mao, at the conference and the democratic spirit of the conference. Ling Qijun (Manager of Renli Carpet Company), a representative from the industrial and commercial sector, said: "Chairman Mao came to the conference to speak, took out a letter from an ordinary person and read it to everyone, asking everyone to discuss and solve the problems raised in the letter. Chairman Mao actually brought such a letter to the conference himself, and his attitude was so sincere and frank. He is truly great! If it were someone else, they would have thrown it into the wastepaper basket long ago." Yu Yifu, a representative from the medical field, said: "Chairman Mao truly consults with the people on matters and asks our representatives to come up with solutions. Only a people's leader can do this." Zhang Manjun, a representative from the Beiping City Branch of the China Democratic League, said: "Even a letter from an ordinary person is valued by Chairman Mao! It is good for everyone to discuss matters of concern to everyone. After this discussion, we have a basic understanding of financial and economic issues." Liang Sicheng, Zheng Xin, and Fei Xiaotong, representatives from the education sector, all believed that Chairman Mao attached great importance to this conference, and Chairman Mao's attitude was very sincere, making people feel close to him. Liang Sicheng said: "This is the first time I have seen Chairman Mao, and the enthusiasm of the masses in supporting him is unprecedented." Yu Yifu, a representative from the medical field, said: "The Communist Party does not write blank checks, they do what they say, unlike the Kuomintang, which only writes blank checks." Han Songshang, a representative from the banking sector, believes that the conference was a complete success. He felt unexpectedly excited about Chairman Mao's attendance and admired the Communist Party representatives for their sincerity and frankness in speaking at the meeting. Sun Fuling said that he participated in this conference and learned some things. For example, when Peng Zhen, the representative of the CPC Beiping Municipal Committee, presided over the discussion of the proposals as chairman, he asked not only who agreed and who opposed, but also who had doubts. This was unheard of in the past. Liu Yifeng, a representative from the commercial sector, said: "The CPC is self-reliant and treats people with kindness." Yang Baojun, a representative from the medical field, said: "The Communist Party is very enthusiastic towards the representatives and attaches great importance to our talks. In the future, I am even more determined to serve the people." Now, representatives from all walks of life are universally and spontaneously adopting various methods to continue to publicize the achievements of the conference and discuss the various resolutions of the conference.
