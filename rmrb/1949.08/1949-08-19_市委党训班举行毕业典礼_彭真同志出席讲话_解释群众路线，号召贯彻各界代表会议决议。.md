The Municipal Party Committee Training Class Holds Graduation Ceremony
　　Comrade Peng Zhen Attends and Speaks
    Explaining the Mass Line and Calling for Implementation of Resolutions of the People's Representative Conference.

　　[Report from this newspaper] The summer training class for party members of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee School, which began on the 18th of last month, has lasted for a month. This week, various branches began to summarize learning achievements and assessments and will conclude today (19th). The graduation ceremony was specially held at the auditorium of the Art College the night before (17th). Comrade Xiang Ziming, the chairman, reported that the training class had studied historical materialism, the people's democratic dictatorship, the Party Constitution, branch work, etc. in one month, and basically completed the learning plan. He encouraged comrades to do a good job when they return to their schools, to improve their studies, and to firmly implement the idea of ​​learning from the masses as a test of the learning gains from this Party training class. Comrade Peng Zhen gave a report amidst warm applause and cheerful laughter from the students as a graduation gift for the students. The report was divided into two parts. The first part explained what the mass line is and how to follow the mass line, and the second part was about the main decisions of the People's Representative Conference. Comrade Peng Zhen used many examples to illustrate the principle of "from the masses, to the masses" and the combination of theory and practice, as well as its specific application. He said: We must serve the people wholeheartedly, and we must trust the masses and learn from the masses, only then can we talk about following the mass line. He then explained that commandism, which exceeds the level of consciousness of the masses and violates the principle of voluntary participation of the masses, and tailism, which lags behind the consciousness of the masses and fails to lead the masses forward, are both wrong. He also said that when the opinions of the Party and the masses are inconsistent, the Party can only adopt methods of persuasion and education, and adhere to principles in accordance with democratic principles to resolve the issue. Later, he talked about the gains and experiences of this Beijing People's Representative Conference and how to implement the spirit and resolutions of the Representative Conference, and emphasized that the Representative Conference is the best organizational form for implementing the mass line and closely integrating with the masses to do a good job. Students should adopt this form more often after returning to their schools.

　　市委党训班举行毕业典礼
  　彭真同志出席讲话
    解释群众路线，号召贯彻各界代表会议决议。
    【本报讯】中共北平市委学校党员暑期训练班，自上月十八日开学以来，已历一月，本周来各支部开始总结学习成果及鉴定，将于今（十九）日结束，前（十七）日晚特假艺专礼堂举行结业典礼。主席项子明同志报告训练班在一个月中学习了唯物史观、人民民主专政、党纲党章、支部工作等，基本上已完成了学习计划。他勉励同志们回到学校作好工作，把学习搞好，并坚定贯彻向群众学习的思想，以作为这次党训班学习收获的一个测验。彭真同志在学员们热烈的掌声和愉快的笑声中作了报告，作为对学员们结业的礼品。报告分两部分，前部分解释什么叫群众路线及如何走群众路线，后一部分是讲的各界代表会的主要决定。彭真同志用很多例证说明了从群众中来到群众中去，理论与实践相结合的原则及其具体运用。他说：必须全心全意为人民服务，并且要相信群众，向群众学习，这样才谈得上走群众路线。接着又说明了，超过群众觉悟程度，违犯群众自愿原则的命令主义和落后于群众觉悟，不能领导群众前进一步的尾巴主义等都是错误的。又说：当着党与群众意见不一致时，党只能采用说服教育的方法，按照民主原则，坚持原则来解决。以后他说到这次北平各界代表会议的收获与经验以及如何贯彻代表会议的精神和决议，并着重指出了代表会议是贯彻群众路线和群众密切结合作好工作的最好组织形式，学员回学校后要多多采用。
