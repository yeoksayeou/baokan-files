　　Beiping Section Stations of the Pingjin Railway Bureau
  　All Staff Urge and Expose a Group of Reactionary Elements to Register
    [This Dispatch] Since the Beiping District of the Pingjin Railway Administration began registering reactionary party and group members on the 27th of last month, the Qianmen District Trade Union has formulated discussion outlines for this purpose, which are distributed to each trade union group for daily discussion. The director of the trade union also exposes the crimes of reactionary parties and groups during the daily morning meetings, and urges reactionary elements to repent and start anew as soon as possible. Now, in addition to workers forming registration and persuasion groups to promote and persuade in various groups, Communist Party members, New Democratic Youth League members, and trade union cadres from various sections and stations are also going deep into each group to actively persuade, and the results are excellent. As of the 9th of this month, 87 people have voluntarily gone to the Public Security Section to register. These include: 3 members of the Kuomintang District Committee, 74 cadres above the branch committee level, 2 cadres above the Three People's Principles Youth League squad leader level, and 8 Central Statistics Bureau correspondents.

　　平津路局北平区各段站
  　全体职工劝导揭发一批反动分子登记
    【本报讯】平津铁路管理局北平办事处所辖北平区各段站，自上月二十七日开始登记反动党团分子以来，前门区段工会为此拟定讨论提纲，发交各工会小组每日进行讨论。工会主任亦于每日朝会时间，揭露反动党团的罪恶，劝导反动分子早日悔过自新。现在除一面已由工人组成登记劝导组到各小组宣传劝导外，并由各段站共产党员、新民主主义青年团员及职工会干部深入各小组积极劝导，成绩极为良好。截至本月九日止，自动赴公安段登记的已有八十七人。计有：国民党区党委三人、分委以上干部七十四人、三青团分队长以上干部二人，中统通讯员八人。
