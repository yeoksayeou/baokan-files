　　【Our Newspaper】The Soviet Construction Photo Exhibition, which closed in Ping on the 28th, has been visited by workers, farmers, students, cultural and educational figures, and ordinary citizens in the past two days, especially cadres from various agencies. On the first day, there were approximately 5,000 visitors, including collective visits from units such as the Yangquan Northwest Cadre Training Corps, the Changxindian Electrical Repair Factory, and the Youth League branch of the Qinghe Woolen Mill, totaling more than 800 people. The exhibition's explanatory booklet sold over 330 copies on the first day, and another 50 or so were sold shortly after the opening this morning. Visitors carefully examined each photo, with some approaching closely to patiently read every explanatory text and copy down statistical figures. All of this demonstrates that every achievement of Soviet construction is a matter of concern for the broad masses of the Chinese people. Famous writer Ye Shengtao, Peking University Council Chairman Tang Yongtong, Peking University professor Chen Yousong, North China University professor Shakov, and Mr. Liu Liangmo, who had just returned from the United States, all visited the exhibition one after another. After viewing the exhibition, they wrote their thoughts in the opinion book. Mr. Chen Yousong said: It has given us a great example and vision for the construction of a new China. We are extremely moved and should strive to catch up. Mr. Liu Liangmo, after comparing the Soviet Union with what he had personally seen in the United States, wrote: The socialist world is growing stronger day by day.

　　苏联建设图片展览两天内五千人参观
    【本报讯】苏联建设图片展览会自二十八日在平闭幕后，两日来前往参观者有工人、农民、学生、文化教育界人士和一般市民，其中尤以各机关干部最多。第一日观众约五千余人，集体前往者有阳泉西北调干团、长辛店电修厂及清河制呢厂的青年团支部等单位共八百余人。该会印就的展览会说明书，第一日即售去三百三十余册，昨日早上开馆不久，又卖出了五十余册。参观的人都仔细看每一张照片，有的人更走到靠近照片的地方耐心地阅读着上面的每一个说明文字，或者抄下一些统计数字。这一切说明了苏联建设的每一件成就，是为广大的中国人民所关心的。名作家叶圣陶、北大校务委员会主任委员汤用彤，北大教授陈友松，华北大学教授沙可夫和甫自美国归来的刘良模先生等均曾先后前往参观，他们看完后在意见簿上写出了自己的感想。陈友松先生说：给了我们一个新中国建设的伟大榜样与远景，我们受了极大的感动，应努力赶上去。刘良模先生则把苏联和自己曾亲身看见的美国比较后，在上面写着：社会主义的世界是在一天天的强大中。
