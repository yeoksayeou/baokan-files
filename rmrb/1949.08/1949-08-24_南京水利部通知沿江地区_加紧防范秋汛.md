Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 23rd: The Water Resources Department of the Nanjing Military Control Commission, in order to strictly prevent autumn floods from causing disaster, has notified Party, government, and military organizations in the regions along the Yangtze River to organize the people to prepare for flood prevention and rescue. According to past experience, autumn flood levels are often higher than summer flood levels. The notification pointed out: All embankments that did not breach during the summer flood season should continue to be heightened and thickened, dangerous sections should be repaired, wave-defying fascine works should be added, and flood prevention and rescue organizations should be strengthened. In areas affected by the summer floods, in addition to intensifying preparations for the recurrence of autumn floods and typhoons, all embankments that have been flooded or have accumulated water must seize the opportunity to drain water and rush to plant autumn crops. The notification stipulates that the above two flood prevention tasks must be completed before August 20th. The Shangxin River, Dashengguan, Shazhou Embankment, Sanyi River and other places in the suburbs of Nanjing are actively starting construction to strengthen repairs. According to observations by meteorologists and water conservancy experts in Nanjing, the possibility of autumn floods in the Yangtze River this year is very high. Due to excessive rainfall in central China in June and July, the water level of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River rose sharply. From late August to September, after temperate low-pressure systems move south, rainfall in the Sichuan and Guizhou areas will increase, and the Han and Sichuan Rivers may flood, which will inevitably cause the water level of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River to rise. In addition, the embankments along the river have been immersed in water for too long, and their water resistance has been weakened, making it easier to cause disasters. Furthermore, typhoons are most frequent in August and September. If they make landfall and strike, the wind will be strong and the waves will be high, and the embankments along the river are prone to danger. Therefore, all localities should strictly guard against this year's autumn floods.

　　南京水利部通知沿江地区
  　加紧防范秋汛
    【新华社南京二十三日电】南京市军管会水利部为严防秋汛成灾，已通知沿江地区党政军各机关组织人民准备防汛抢险。根据以往经验，秋汛水位往往比夏汛水位为高。通知指出：在夏汛期中未曾溃决的各圩堤，应继续加高培厚，补修险工，添筑防御波浪的埽工，加强防汛抢险组织。在夏汛中受灾的地区，除加紧防备秋汛和台风的再度侵袭外，各处曾进水或有积水的圩堤，须抓紧时机排水，抢种秋禾。通知规定：上列两项防汛工作，统限于八月二十日以前竣工。南京市郊上新河、大胜关、沙洲圩、三义河等处，正积极动工加强修筑中。据南京气象学家及水利专家观察，今年长江秋汛的可能性很大。由于六、七两月华中雨量过多，长江中下游水位骤高。八月下旬至九月间温带低气压南行后，川、黔地区雨量将增多，汉、川两江可能泛滥，长江中下游水位势必因此上升。加以沿江堤防浸水过久，抗水力削弱，更易酿成灾患。此外，八、九月间台风最多，如登陆袭击，风急浪高，沿江堤圩容易出险。因此，各地对今年秋汛应严加防范。
