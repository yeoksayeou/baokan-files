[Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station, 17th Broadcast] Recently, a number of luxury goods stores in this city, such as silver shops, jewelry stores, and antique shops, are changing their business directions one after another. A week ago, the Hongxiang Jewelry Store at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Fuxu Road had already been transformed into the Hongxiang Bicycle Shop, selling bicycles. The Xinbaocheng Silver Shop at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road has also been converted to sell radios. The Fang Jiuxia Silver Shop near Xizang Road on Nanjing Road was transformed into a distribution point for the Sanyou Industrial Society a week ago. This was a solution proposed by the 39 employees of the Fang Jiuxia Silver Shop. International, Pinzhen and other jewelry companies have already converted to operating department stores. The Coral Forest Antiques Circulation Office has been converted into a sewing factory. Fuyuancai Antique Shop has also been engaged in the consignment of department store business for customers for some time.

　　沪奢侈品商店  纷纷转业
    【上海人民广播电台十七日广播】本市一部分奢侈品的商店，如银楼、珠宝、古玩等行业，近来正纷纷改变营业方向，在一周以前，同孚路福煦路口的鸿祥珠宝首饰店，已经改变成为鸿祥车行，经售脚踏车。南京路山西路口的新宝成银楼，也已改卖无线电。南京路近西藏路方九霞银楼，早在周前就改成三友实业社的分销处，这是方九霞银楼三十九位职工提出来的办法。国际、品珍等首饰公司，业已改营百货。珊瑚林古玩流通处，改为缝纫厂。福源斋古玩店，也早就在经营对客寄售百货业务。中国国货公司，劳资双方新近组成的业务会议上，业已提出专售日用必需品问题，预备从根本上彻底改变业务经营的方向。
