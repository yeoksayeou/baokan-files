Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 2nd: Before entering Hui areas to pursue and annihilate the two Ma bandit armies, a certain corps of the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army issued ten "Rules for Uniting with the Hui People." These rules require the entire army to conscientiously implement the correct policy of uniting with domestic ethnic minorities to jointly eliminate the remnants of the reactionaries while bravely advancing to pursue and annihilate the Ma bandits. The rules also require respecting the customs and religious beliefs of the Hui people and helping the broad masses of Hui people to break free from the criminal rule of bandit leaders such as Ma Bufang and Ma Hongkui as soon as possible, in order to accelerate the complete liberation of Northwest China. The ten rules are as follows:

	I. Protect mosques and tombs, do not enter them casually, and do not draw propaganda pictures or paste posters on their walls.
	II. Do not eat pork, mule, or horse meat in Hui people's homes; when eating beef or mutton, ask an Ahong (Imam) to slaughter it.
	III. Do not talk to young Hui women, and do not enter Hui women's houses.
	IV. Do not interfere with Ahongs performing prayers and chanting scriptures at night; do not peep or make noise when Hui people are praying.
	V. Do not bathe in Hui people's water houses.
	VI. Wash your hands before drawing water from Hui people's wells, and do not pour the remaining water back.
	VII. Address Hui people as "fellow villagers" or "fellow countrymen," and do not call them "Hui zi" (a derogatory term for Hui people).
	VIII. Do not say "pig" to Hui people, do not ask Hui people why they don't eat pork, and do not ask what a mosque is.
	IX. Do not smoke or drink alcohol in Hui people's homes.
	X. Everyone should publicize our Party's policies toward ethnic minorities.
