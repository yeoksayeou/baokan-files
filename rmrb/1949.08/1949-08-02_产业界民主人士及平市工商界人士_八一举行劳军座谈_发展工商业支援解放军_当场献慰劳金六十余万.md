    [Reported by this newspaper] Democratic figures Sun Qimeng, Yan Baohang, and figures from the industrial and commercial sector in Beiping including Liu Yifeng, Fu Huating, Chen Yintang, Ling Qijun, Sun Fuling, and others, held an "August 1st" Army Appreciation Symposium at the European and American Alumni Association at 9:30 AM on the 31st. Comrade Xue Zizheng, Secretary-General of the Beiping Municipal People's Government, was invited to attend. In his report, Secretary-General Xue vividly described the arduous 22-year history of the People's Liberation Army's founding, and explained that the reason why the people's armed forces are able to thoroughly defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries and develop into such a powerful force of four million people today is because it is an armed force led by the Chinese Communist Party that wholeheartedly struggles for the interests of the people, and persists in using armed struggle to overthrow reactionary rule. At the same time, it is also the result of the unity of all strata of the people against the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. Finally, Secretary-General Xue pointed out: The best and most practical way for us to show our appreciation to the People's Liberation Army now is to develop production and improve the existing industry and commerce, which is the best support for the People's Liberation Army. He said, "This is something everyone present can do." Subsequently, Mr. Ling Qijun, Deputy General Manager of Beiping Renli Carpet Company, who chaired the meeting, stated, "We must carry out this task for the long term, completing our tasks every year, every month, and every day." This was immediately followed by a lively discussion on methods of army appreciation. Attendees enthusiastically donated a total of 659,000 yuan in慰劳 money on the spot. It was also decided that on the Army Day anniversary, representatives would be sent with gifts and letters of appreciation to the People's Liberation Army headquarters to express their appreciation.

    当场献慰劳金六十余万
    【本报讯】民主人士孙起孟、阎宝航及北平市工商界人士刘一峰、傅华亭、陈荫棠、凌其峻、孙孚凌等，三十一日上午九时半假欧美同学会举行“八一”劳军座谈，北平市人民政府秘书长薛子正同志被邀出席。薛秘书长在报告中生动地叙述了人民解放军二十二年来艰苦奋斗的建军历史，并说明今天人民的武装能澈底打垮国民党反动派，并发展到四百万人这样一支强大的力量，是由于它是中国共产党领导下的全心全意为人民大众的利益奋斗，并且坚持以武装斗争推翻反动统治的武装，同时也是各阶层人民团结一致反对蒋介石卖国贼的结果。最后薛秘书长指出：我们现在对人民解放军的最好的、最实际的慰问，就是发展生产，把现有的工商业搞好，才是给人民解放军最好的支持。他说：“这是在座各位都可以办到的。”接着主席北平仁立地毯公司副总经理凌其峻先生表示：“我们要长期执行这一任务，每年每月每日完成我们的任务。”随即对劳军方式展开了热烈的讨论。到会者当场纷纷捐献慰劳金共达六十五万九千元。并决定于建军纪念日派代表携带实物慰问信等到人民解放军总部去慰劳。
