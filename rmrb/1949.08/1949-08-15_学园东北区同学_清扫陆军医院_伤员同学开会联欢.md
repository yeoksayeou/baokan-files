    Northeast District Academy Students
    Clean Army Hospital
    Wounded Soldiers and Students Hold a Get-Together
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] On the afternoons of the 4th and 6th, students from the Northeast District Academy held two half-day labor sessions to clean the Army Hospital on North Xiaojie Street. Work began at 3:00 PM on the 4th. The entire district was divided into three groups; some pulled weeds, some picked up stones. Everyone hummed tunes while working energetically. Students from Provincial Middle School and No. 1 Boys' Middle School took off their shoes and socks, rolled up their trouser legs and sleeves, and rushed into the muddy pond to pull weeds. Two female students from Provincial Middle School were completely soaked; many students had their legs and hands scratched by the weeds, but they worked silently. Everyone shouted excitedly, "We will not rest until the task is completed!" One student said excitedly, "Still want to rest! If the People's Liberation Army rested while fighting, the enemy would have attacked long ago." A female student from Huizhong Middle School finished her work and went to help others. The children from the literacy class jumped and shouted, "Big brothers and sisters, work hard!", "Strive to be models of labor!" Everyone worked until after 5:00 PM before excitedly ending their work.
    On the afternoon of the 6th, the students came with even greater enthusiasm to complete the remaining work. Ling Ruiji, Deputy Director of the Academy, asked the students if they were tired from the previous day's work. Everyone replied excitedly, "Not tired at all!" Work began at 2:30 PM. The fiery sun shone on every young friend, sweat dripped down, everyone carried shovels, hoes, and large baskets, panting and singing, "Let's go all out, students hey yo!" The joyful singing boosted the students' energy. The students of Fifth Middle School were very energetic. When others were finished, they kept working. A female student from Chongci Middle School carried a basket and happily sang, "We workers have strength." A get-together was held at 6:30 PM, with students and wounded soldiers sitting face to face. A wounded soldier with crutches said sincerely, "We will definitely bring the labor enthusiasm of the students today to the front lines and tell all the commanders and soldiers. We must redouble our efforts to kill the enemy and respond to your enthusiasm." Finally, he shouted excitedly, "Attack Guangzhou! Attack Taiwan! Capture the bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek alive! Carry the revolution through to the end!" Then the whole place erupted in thunderous applause and slogans. A female student from No. 2 Girls' Middle School paid tribute to the wounded soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on behalf of everyone. She said, "We will resolutely follow you. As you liberate a place, we will immediately build it up." Then the entertainment program began. Finally, all the students were divided into fourteen groups to listen to the wounded soldiers tell battle stories. The meeting adjourned in cheers at about 9:00 PM.

    清扫陆军医院
    伤员同学开会联欢
    【本报讯】青年学园东北区同学于四、六两日下午，举行两次半日劳动，清扫北小街陆军医院。四日下午三点钟工作开始了。全区共分三组，有的拔草，有的捡石子，大家一边哼着小曲，一边起劲的干起来。省中和男一中的同学脱了鞋袜，挽起裤腿，卷起袖子，争先恐后的踏入泥塘去拔草，省中两位女同学全身都被淹湿了；有好些同学腿和手被乱草磨破了，可是他们还是一声不响的干活。大家兴奋的高喊：“不完成任务决不休息！”一位同学激动的说：“还想休息！解放军打仗时要一休息敌人早攻上来了。”惠中女同学把自己工作干完了，又去帮助别人做。儿童识字班的小朋友，一边蹦一边喊：“大哥、大姐加油干”，“努力劳动争模范！”大家一直干到五点多，才兴奋的结束了这段工作。
    六日下午，同学们抱着更高的热情，来完成剩余的工作。学园凌瑞骥副主任关心的问同学前天的工作累不累，大家兴奋的回答：“一点也不累！”二点半开始工作，火红的太阳照在每个青年朋友的身上，汗珠一滴滴流着，大家扛着锹，背着锄，气喘喘的抬着大筐，唱着：“同学们加油干来吗嘿哟！”欢乐的歌声，助长了同学们的干劲。五中同学顶起劲，人家都做完了，他们还继续干。崇慈女同学抬着筐，高兴的唱着：“咱们工人有力量”。六点半开了一个联欢会，同学和伤员们对面坐下来。一位拄着拐杖的伤员诚挚的说：“我们一定把今天同学们的劳动热情带到前方去，告诉全体指战员。我们要加倍的努力杀敌，来回答你们的热忱。”最后他激奋的高喊：“打到广州去！打到台湾去！活捉匪首蒋介石！把革命进行到底！”跟着全场响起了一片雷动般的掌声，口号声。女二中同学代表大家向解放军伤员们致敬，她说：“我们坚决跟着你们，你们解放一个地方，我们立刻建设一个地方。”跟着开始了游艺节目。最后，全体同学分成了十四小组，听伤员讲述战斗故事。九时许，在欢呼声中散会。  （万金）
