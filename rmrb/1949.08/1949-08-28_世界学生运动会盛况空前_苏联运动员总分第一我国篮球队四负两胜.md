　　世界学生运动会盛况空前
    苏联运动员总分第一我国篮球队四负两胜
    【新华社布拉格二十七日电】世界学联所主持的作为世界青年与学生联欢大会一部分的第十届世界大学生夏季运动会，从八月十四日在匈京开始，已在二十一日胜利闭幕。苏联、新民主国家以及殖民地、半殖民地和资本主义国家，都派遣了几十或几百优秀的学生运动员参加了运动会。运动会的节目非常丰富，包括田径赛、拳击、划船、自行车、摩托车等比赛及各种球赛、举重赛等。
    运动会的比赛也是在团结友爱的精神下进行的。苏联运动员所得的总分最多，赢得团体奖的第一名。这说明在社会主义制度下，体力和智力同样地得到无限发展的机会。有苏联选手参加的比赛，共有六十九个第一名锦标，苏联选手就赢得其中的四十八个。苏联选手共获得了一百一十四个金奖章、四十二个银奖章、三十个铜奖章和一大批奖杯。其次，匈牙利选手共赢得四十五个第一名锦标，法国赢得了十三个。在二百公尺的赛跑中，波兰选手陶齐克以二十一点二秒创造了世界学生纪录。中华全国学联所选派的篮球队参加了篮球赛，这是中国学生的真正代表参加世界性运动会的第一次。篮球赛共有九个国家参加。中国队参加了六场比赛，四负两胜。比赛结果，苏联队得了锦标，其余的名次是捷、匈、法、鲜、中、保、波、罗。
    运动会的开幕和闭幕典礼中，苏联的运动员们受到最大的欢呼，中国篮球队也受到热烈欢迎。当中国篮球队举着中国人民解放军军旗入场时，观众都站立起来鼓掌，一遍又一遍地欢呼毛泽东。在比赛结束的一天，好几个国家的篮球队和中国队开了个话别会，并互相赠送了纪念礼物。有许多匈牙利青年、工厂和布达佩斯近郊小镇上的体育团体，都来约中国队作友谊比赛。
