The students automatically divided into four groups and interned in the photochemistry, motor group, machinery group, and geological survey group research laboratories according to their interests and abilities. The photochemistry laboratory is experimenting with making photographic dry plates. The work of the mechanical group is sand casting, melting copper, iron, lead, and other metals.

The students get along very closely and affectionately with the workers. (Fu Jen Catholic University Communications Group)

He called on the students to give full play to their initiative. If the group leader is not present, the students should conduct discussions themselves, seize the time, and ensure the completion of the task. Now each class is also conducting discussions during nap time, responding to this call and actively launching work. (Third Branch Group of the Summer Study Group)
