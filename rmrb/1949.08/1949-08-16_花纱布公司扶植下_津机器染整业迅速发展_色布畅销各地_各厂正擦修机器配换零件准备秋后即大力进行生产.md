　　With the Support of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation,
　　Tianjin's Machine Dyeing and Finishing Industry Develops Rapidly;
　　Colored Cloth Sells Well Everywhere;
　　Factories are Overhauling Machines, Replacing Parts, and Preparing for Large-Scale Production After Autumn
　　[Tianjin News] Tianjin's machine dyeing and finishing industry, which ranks first in North China, has reached 49 factories by the end of June this year (including the Hebei Dyeing Factory, which has incomplete equipment). There are a total of 420 pairs of dyeing vats. If calculated on the basis of 10 hours of operation per day, they can dye more than 14,000 bolts of blue cloth, or more than 15,000 bolts of grey cloth, or more than 20,000 bolts of straw yellow cloth. They can dye more than 20 colors such as blue, red, white, grey, yellow, and green.
　　During the Kuomintang rule, due to the isolation between urban and rural areas and the persecution of corrupt economic policies, it was extremely difficult for the industry to maintain operations. In the second half of last year, most of the 47 factories in the industry had shut down. Only seven factories, including Yongxing Rongji Dyeing Factory (producing Flying Brand colored cloth), Dahua Dyeing Factory (producing Skating Brand), Xintai Dyeing Factory (producing Lion Brand), Yida Dyeing Factory (producing Golden Bell Brand), and Tianhe Dyeing Factory (producing Pacific Brand), maintained operations. In addition, more than 10 others were operating intermittently. After liberation, trade between urban and rural areas gradually became smooth, and the various colored cloths produced in Tianjin sold well in Northeast China, North China, and Shandong, opening up a path for the development of Tianjin's dyeing and finishing industry. The Tianjin China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation and department stores further supported the industry. Fifteen companies, including Tianjin, Huaguang, and Hualun, received orders and processing support from the two companies, dyeing and bleaching nearly 40,000 bolts of cloth. As a result, all the dyeing factories that were not operating resumed operations, and even the Hualun Dyeing Factory, which had been closed for more than three years, started operations. The business situation of each factory is good, and the net profit can reach more than 20% in peak months. Except for some factories that cannot operate all machines due to insufficient power, more than 75% of the machines in the entire industry are operating. The enthusiasm of the factory workers for production has also increased compared with before liberation. For example, before liberation, 80 workers at the Tianjin Dyeing Factory dyed 800 bolts of cloth in a day and night. After liberation, using the same machines, 50 workers can dye 800 bolts of cloth in a day and night. After the factory conveyed Comrade Shaoqi's report, the workers became more active in production. The highest record for dyeing cloth in May was 1,080 bolts in a day and night by 50 workers, which is double the production efficiency before liberation. Other dyeing factories also dye 10 or 8 more bolts per dyeing vat than before. Many factory owners have also eliminated unnecessary doubts and plan to expand their operations. For example, Dahua Dyeing Factory has added a printing machine, Wanxin Dyeing Factory has added four dyeing vats, and Tianjin Dyeing Factory is planning to purchase a singeing machine and a refining machine. Some factories have increased the number of workers. For example, 11 factories, including Xintai and Huaguang, have added 10 ordinary workers, 27 apprentices, and 35 temporary workers.
　　After mid-June, the industry entered a slack season, but most dyeing factories continued to operate as usual. Only one-third of the factories were operating intermittently. The factories anticipate more business after autumn, and are overhauling machines and replacing parts during the slack season, preparing to start large-scale production immediately after the slack season.

　　花纱布公司扶植下
  　津机器染整业迅速发展
  　色布畅销各地
    各厂正擦修机器配换零件准备秋后即大力进行生产
    【天津讯】位居华北第一位的本市机器染整业，截至本年六月底止，计达四十九家（包括设备不完善的河北染厂），共有染槽四百二十对，如以每日开工十小时计算，可染青布或蓝布一万四千余匹，或灰布一万五千余匹，染草黄则能染二万余匹；能染青、蓝、红、白、灰、黄、绿等二十余种颜色。
    该业在国民党统治时期，由于城乡隔绝和腐败的经济政策的迫害，营业极难维持。在去年下半年，该业四十七家工厂已大部停工，仅有出飞行牌色布的永兴荣记染厂、出滑冰牌的大华染厂、出狮子牌的信太染厂、出金钟牌的义大染厂、出太平洋牌的天河染厂等七家维持开工；另外有十余家时开时停。解放后，城乡贸易逐渐畅通，本市出产的各种色布畅销东北、华北、和山东等地，给本市染整业开拓出发展的道路；本市花纱布公司和百货公司更对该业加以扶植，受到两公司订货加工扶植的有天津、华光、华纶等十五家，共漂染布近四万匹。这样，不开工的染厂，都复了工，连停工三年以上的华纶染厂都开工了。各厂营业情形良好，在旺月时可获纯利达百分之二十以上。除部分工厂因电力不足不能开动全部机器外，全业开动的机器占总数的百分之七十五以上。各厂职工生产积极性，也较解放前提高了。例如天津染厂解放前八十名工人一昼夜染八百匹布；解放后用同样的机器，五十名工人一昼夜就可以染八百匹。该厂传达了少奇同志的报告以后，工人生产更形积极，五月份染布的最高纪录，为五十名工人一昼夜染一千零八十匹，比解放前的生产效率增加了一倍。其他染厂每对染槽也较前多染十匹、八匹不等。不少厂子的资方也消除了无谓的疑虑，计划扩大经营。例如大华染厂新增印花机一部，万新染厂新增染槽四对，天津染厂正计划购买烧毛机、精炼机。有的工厂已增加了工人，例如信太、华光等十一家共增加普通工人十名、工徒二十七名、临时工三十五名。
    六月中旬以后，该业步入背月，但大部分染厂照常开工，时开时停的厂子只占三分之一。各厂预料秋后有更多的业务，正在背月中擦修机器换配零件，准备背月一过立即大力生产。
