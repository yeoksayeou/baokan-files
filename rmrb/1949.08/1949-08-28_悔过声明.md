　　We, Shi Yougui, Li Zhenhe, Jin Guilin, and Zhang Zhisheng, because our thinking was not enlightened, and only sought selfish gains by secretly gathering to gamble, were investigated by the government and gambling paraphernalia was found on the spot and taken to the People's Court. We should have been severely punished, but thanks to the lenient policy of the People's Court, our past transgressions were not pursued, and we were kindly advised, corrected, and given the opportunity to repent and start anew. After self-examination, we deeply realize that our past was completely wrong, and we will start anew and never repeat our mistakes, determined to serve the people and move forward, and not fail the government's leniency and care for us. We hereby publish this statement.

　　Repenters: Shi Yougui, Li Zhenhe, Jin Guilin, Zhang Zhisheng, together.
