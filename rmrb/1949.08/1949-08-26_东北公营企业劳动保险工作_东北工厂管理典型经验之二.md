　　Labor Insurance Work in Northeast China's State-Owned Enterprises
  　Typical Experience in Factory Management in Northeast China (Part 2)
    The labor insurance work in state-owned enterprises in Northeast China was established under the conditions that the working class had suffered long-term exploitation by the Japanese invaders, their lives and livelihoods were not guaranteed, and after liberation, through arduous struggles, production had gradually returned to normal, and various enterprises were implementing different treatment methods for the employees' birth, death, illness, injury, and disability; it aims to "protect the health of workers and staff in state-owned enterprises, alleviate their wartime living difficulties," thereby enhancing the awareness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff, and ensuring the smooth progress of economic construction. In the past six months, this new work, which had no experience at all, has achieved considerable gains from the initial preparation to the formal implementation, and at the same time, it has proved that establishing a labor insurance system under the specific conditions of Northeast China is necessary and correct.
    I. Process and Situation
    January to March this year was the preparation stage for implementing labor insurance work. According to the decision of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC on implementing the Labor Insurance Regulations, the notice and publicity outline of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions on preparing for the implementation of labor insurance, the implementation was first started in seven major state-owned enterprises: railways, mines, military industries, military supplies, textiles, post and telecommunications, and electricity. During this period, extensive publicity was carried out among the workers and staff, labor insurance committees at all levels were established jointly by the enterprise trade unions and administration under the leadership of the trade union chairman, and grass-roots review committees directly elected by the workers and staff were established. Based on the trial implementation rules of labor insurance promulgated by the Northeast Administrative Committee, various procedures and systems for implementing labor insurance were formulated, various enterprises paid labor insurance funds, and some medical equipment and welfare facilities were established and rectified. Complex and heavy registration work was carried out universally among all workers and staff.
    From April 1st, labor insurance was officially implemented in the seven major enterprises. Mines, railways and other larger units held respect-for-the-elderly meetings, and various units held celebration meetings. At the same time, combined with the handling of specific issues, in-depth publicity and education were carried out among the workers and staff. Medical and welfare equipment in various enterprises was also improved to some extent. The procedures and systems for implementing labor insurance were gradually improved to be simpler and more accurate. Problems such as birth, aging, illness, death, injury, and disability of workers and staff were all handled according to the prescribed treatment. Starting in May, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions began to establish three employee sanatoriums. By the end of June, factories with many female workers planned to improve and establish nurseries, mines planned to establish disabled veterans' homes, and major industrial cities planned to jointly establish and improve employee medical equipment.
    From the actual situation, on the one hand, the number of people actually receiving labor insurance funds and the expenditure of labor insurance funds are increasing month by month. According to statistics: in April, the number of people actually receiving labor insurance funds in the seven major enterprises accounted for 1.3% of the total number of employees, and the expenditure of labor insurance funds accounted for 14% of the total income; in May, the number of people actually receiving increased to more than 2%, and the expenditure of labor insurance funds increased to 26%. On the other hand, the actual benefits enjoyed by employees and the number of people enjoying the benefits, in addition to the expenditure of labor insurance funds, the enterprise administration also bears a large part, and the number of people enjoying the benefits is also relatively large. For example, medical expenses for employees' illnesses and injuries, full wages during the medical treatment period for work-related injuries, subsidies for non-work-related injuries, full wages for female employees during maternity leave, and funeral expenses for work-related deaths are all borne by the enterprise administration; and direct relatives can receive treatment in the enterprise medical center without handling fees and reduced drug costs. These expenses are all benefits enjoyed by employees. Taking the Fourth Textile Factory as an example: in April, there were 2,983 employees, and the labor insurance fund was 134,269,809 yuan, accounting for 3% of the total wage. The actual expenditure was 6,145,754 yuan, accounting for 0.45% of the labor insurance fund; other expenditures by the administration accounted for more than 3.1% of the total wage. In May, although the expenditure of labor insurance funds increased to 0.7%, the expenditure by the administration accounted for more than 5% of the total wage.
    In view of the fact that the methods and systems of labor insurance have been basically established in the seven major state-owned systems, and there are no major deviations in the implementation, in order to comply with the urgent requests of the broad masses of workers and staff, the Northeast Administrative Committee decided in May that all state-owned mining industries that have officially started and resumed production and have fixed production year-round should implement the labor insurance method from July 1st.
    II. Gains Since the Implementation of Labor Insurance
    First, the awareness and organization of the working class have been improved. Because labor insurance has become a national legal system under the decisions and orders of the Party and the government, and is implemented resolutely and conscientiously, the awareness of the working class has been significantly improved among workers, especially in areas where publicity and education are relatively good, making workers more resolutely support the Party and the people's government, enhancing the feeling of being the masters of the country, eliminating the "conservative thinking" left over from history, eliminating the thinking of "raising children to prevent old age," "relying on God's blessing," and relying on fate, and further recognizing the strength of the working class's unity and the importance of consolidating the organization.
    Second, the production enthusiasm of the workers has been greatly strengthened. The most significant thing is that older workers universally and actively teach apprentices. Due to the implementation of labor insurance funds, the ideological worries of "teaching apprentices to starve the masters" have been eliminated. Many old workers say: "In the past, I would never teach these two hands (skills) to others, because I was afraid that no one would want me when I got old. Now that there is labor insurance, why should I keep it?" In railways and some mines and factories, apprentice-teaching competitions have been automatically launched. Among ordinary workers, seeing that there are economic guarantees for birth, aging, illness, death, injury, and disability, their work enthusiasm has been stabilized and they have become more active. Some who originally wanted to return to their hometowns to divide the land are now working with peace of mind, and the workers and staff have automatically dedicated the saved industrial, mining, and transportation materials to the country. Female workers are generally more active than before after the implementation of labor insurance. They said: "When the enemy was here, female workers not only had no leave and subsidies for childbirth, but would also lose their jobs if they had children. Now the factory treats us so well, it would be unfair to not work hard." In short, since the implementation of labor insurance, production efficiency has generally increased. For example, the Fushun Mine produced an average of 102,000 tons per month in January, February, and March. In April, May, and June, the number of people was reduced compared with the previous months, and the average monthly output was increased to 166,000 tons. The molding team of a military industry factory increased the daily output of finished products from 800 boxes to 1,000 boxes. The average daily output of cloth per loom in the Shenyang Textile Factory increased from 32.88 yards in January, February, and March to 37.21 yards in April, May, and June. Such facts are common in various enterprises and factories.
    III. Existing Problems and Shortcomings
    1. The medical treatment of employees' illnesses has not been well resolved. This is due to the lack of medical equipment, its simplicity, and the lack of medicines, equipment, and doctors. The work style of some medical personnel is not good, so employees' illnesses and injuries cannot be treated quickly and appropriately. In addition, subjective efforts to improve this aspect are not enough, so this phenomenon is still widespread.
    2. Some units are isolated, mechanical, and rule-following in the implementation of labor insurance, out of touch with the production situation and the current demands of employees. Even among leading comrades in the same industry and employee work comrades, there are still inconsistent views and opinions on labor insurance. They have not well enlightened and concentrated the opinions of the masses and given play to the supervision of the masses, so the labor insurance work cannot be improved a step further.
    3. The current labor insurance work is only passively paying attention to ex-post relief, and has not paid attention to assisting enterprise administrations in studying factory safety and hygiene equipment and preventing and reducing the occurrence of illnesses and injuries. At the same time, there is still egalitarianism in the implementation of labor insurance. Although underground miners and chemical workers who are harmful to health have better treatment, the difference is not significant. There is basically no difference between important industrial sectors and general sectors. Giving preferential treatment to those who produce well has not been implemented in practice.
    4. There is still a lack of investigation into the methods of collective labor insurance undertakings and research on specific plans. For example, what are the most important and urgent requirements and possible collective labor insurance undertakings of the majority of employees at present? How to do it? There is a lack of understanding and research. There are still problems in the methods and systems for implementing labor insurance, such as the preservation of funds being mainly based on enterprises and factories, and the responsibilities and powers of the provincial and municipal trade unions for the labor insurance work of local state-owned enterprises have not been resolved. The procedures for employees to receive labor insurance funds are not simple enough, and the current proportion of labor insurance fund expenditure is not large, and not many people enjoy the benefits. These situations need to be well studied and resolved.
    IV. Experience in Implementing Labor Insurance Work in the Past Six Months
    1. The relatively smooth establishment and implementation of the labor insurance system is due to the unified mobilization of the Party, administration, and trade union, clear and specific laws and regulations, and reliance on and giving play to the strength of the broad masses of workers and staff. The decisions, orders, and notices of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC, the Northeast Political and Legal Committee, and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions were implemented to the Party, administration, and trade unions of various enterprises and factories, and the labor insurance committees at all levels organized the forces of all parties, ensuring the smooth progress of the work. Carrying out extensive publicity among the workers and staff, running labor insurance training classes, establishing labor insurance officers in trade union groups, organizing everyone to discuss and study, and conducting registration, thus organizing and giving play to the strength of the masses, and the work will proceed smoothly.
    2. To start implementing the labor insurance system, there must be considerable conditions and relatively full preparation. If the factory has not officially resumed production, production is not normal, the personnel are not fixed, the management system is not sound, and the workers have not been sufficiently mobilized and organized, it is more difficult to formally establish the labor insurance system, and it is not very urgent and necessary. In terms of preparation work, if the medical equipment and the ideological preparation of employees and labor insurance organizations are relatively mature, the implementation will be better. In Northeast China, because the medical problems have not been resolved in a relatively appropriate and thoughtful manner, the implementation has aroused many opinions from employees; in many units, because the understanding of some employees is not correct (there are excessively high demands), the effect of the implementation has been reduced.
    3. The implementation of labor insurance must pay attention to publicity and education, and be closely combined with the specific situation of production and the emotional demands of employees. If it is only a simple and individual distribution of labor insurance funds, without paying attention to the publicity and education of the individual and ordinary employees, without combining it with encouraging and promoting the resolution of current production tasks, and without studying and combining it with the emotional demands of employees, the effect of the implementation will be reduced, and the labor insurance work cannot be improved.

　　东北公营企业劳动保险工作
  　东北工厂管理典型经验之二
    东北公营企业的劳动保险工作，是在工人阶级受尽日寇的长期压榨，生命生活毫无保证，解放后又经过艰苦奋斗，生产已逐渐走向正轨，各企业对职工的生、死、疾病伤残已实行着不同待遇办法的条件和情况下建立起来的；是以“保护公营企业中工人与职员之健康，减轻其战时生活困难”，从而提高广大职工群众的觉悟与生产积极性，保证顺利进行经济建设为目的。半年来，这一完全没有经验的新工作，从开始准备到正式实行，已经取得相当大的收获，同时也证明了在东北具体情况下建立劳动保险制度，是应该而正确的。
    一、经过与情况
    今年一月至三月为实行劳保工作的准备阶段。根据中共东北局关于实行劳动保险条例的决定，东北职工总会实施劳动保险准备工作的通知和宣传大纲，首先在铁路、矿山、军工、军需、纺织、邮电、电气七大国营企业开始实行。在此期间，在职工中进行了广泛的宣传，建立了各企业工会和行政共同组成在工会主任主持下的各级劳保委员会和由职工直接选举的基层审核委员会，并根据东北行政委员会颁布的劳动保险试行细则，制定了实行劳动保险的各种手续和制度，各企业缴纳劳保基金，建立和整顿了一些医疗设备和福利设施，在全体职工中普遍的进行了复杂繁重的登记工作。
    从四月一日起，劳动保险在七大企业正式实行。矿山、铁路等较大单位举行敬老会，各单位举行庆祝会，同时结合具体问题的处理，在职工中进行了深入一步的宣传教育，各企业医疗福利设备又都有些改进，实行劳保的手续和制度，也逐渐改善的比较简单和准确，对于职工中发生的生老病死伤残等问题，都按规定之待遇处理。五月份起，东北职工总会着手创办三处职工疗养院。六月底，女工多的工厂则计划改善和建立托儿所，矿山则计划办残废养老院，各大产业大城市则计划联合建立和改善职工医疗设备。
    从实际情况来看，一方面是实得劳保金的人数和劳保金的支出是逐月增多的。据统计：四月份七大企业中实得劳保金者占职工总人数的百分之一·三，劳保金的支出占收入总数的百分之十四；五月份实得人数则增为百分之二强，劳保金的支出增为百分之二十六。另方面职工实际享受之利益和人数，除劳保金支出外，企业行政还负担着很大部分，享受人数也较多。如职工病伤之医疗费，公伤医疗期间之全部工资，非因公伤之补助金，女职工生育期间之全部工资，及因公死亡丧葬费等均由企业行政负责；而直系亲属在企业医疗所治病免手续费，减收药费，这些费用的支出，亦均为职工所享受之利益。以第四纺织厂为例：四月份职工二、九八三人，劳保基金以工资百分之三为一三四、二六九、八○九元，实际支出共六、一四五、七五四元，占劳保金百分之○·四五；其他由行政支出者则占全部工资的百分之三·一强。五月份劳保金的支出虽较前增多为百分之○·七，但由行政支出数则占全部工资的百分之五强。
    鉴于劳动保险的办法与制度在七大国营系统已基本建立，实行中尚无重大偏差，为顺应广大职工群众的迫切请求，东北行政委员会已于五月间决定，凡正式开工复业，常年固定生产的公营矿业，从七月一日起，均实行劳动保险办法。
    二、实行劳动保险以来的收获
    首先是提高了工人阶级觉悟与组织性。由于劳动保险是在党和政府的决定、命令下成为国家的法律制度，实行时坚决认真，在工人中，特别是宣传教育比较好的地区，工人阶级觉悟有显著的提高，使工人更坚决的拥护党和人民政府，增强了国家主人翁的感觉，打消了历史上遗留下来的“保守思想”，打消了“养儿防老”“靠天保佑”和靠命运的思想，进一步认识到工人阶级的团结力量和巩固组织的重要。
    其次，工人生产积极性大大加强。最显著的是老年工人普遍而积极的教学徒，由于劳保金的实行，解除了“教会徒弟，饿死师父”的思想顾虑，很多老工人都说：“我过去这两手（技术）死也不教人，怕我老了没人要，现在有了劳保，我还留他干什么？”在铁路和有的矿山、工厂里都自动开展了带学徒竞赛。在一般工人间，见到生老病死伤残都有了经济保证，因而稳固了工作情绪更积极起来，原来有些要求回乡分地的，也都安心生产了，工友们并将保存的工矿交通器材，自动献交给国家。女工们在实行劳保后，一般的都比以前积极，她们说：“敌人在时，女工生育不仅没有假期和补助金，有了孩子就要失业。现在工厂对咱这样好，不好好干就对不起人。”总之，自从实行劳保后，生产效率普遍提高了，如抚顺矿一、二、三月份平均每月产十万二千吨，四、五、六月人数较前还有减少，每月平均产量提到十六万六千吨。军工某厂翻砂股，每日成品产量由以前的八百箱提高到千箱。沈阳纺织厂织布每台由一、二、三月日产布三二·八八码增至四、五、六月平均产三七·二一码。这样的事实，在各企业各工厂都是普遍的现象。
    三、目前存在的问题和缺点
    一、没有很好解决职工病的医疗问题。这是由于医疗设备缺乏、简陋，药品器材医师缺乏。部分医务人员作风不好，因此职工病伤不能得到迅速适当的医疗，加之主观在这方面的努力改进不够，故这一现象还普遍的存在。
    二、有些单位在实行劳动保险中是孤立的、机械的、照条文办事，与生产情况和职工当前要求脱节，甚至在同业领导同志和职工工作同志间对劳保还存在不一致的看法和意见，也没有很好的启发和集中群众的意见、发挥群众的监督，因而不能使劳保工作提高一步。
    三、目前的劳保工作还只是消极的注意于事后的救济，对于协助企业行政研究工厂安全卫生设备，预防和减少病伤的发生没有注意。同时在劳保实行中还有平均主义，下井矿工和有损健康的化学工人虽有较优待遇，但相差不多，重要产业部门与一般部门基本没有区别，对于生产好的给予优待，亦未贯彻到实际中去。
    四、对于集体劳保事业的办法还缺乏情况的调查，和具体计划的研究，如当前大多数职工所最主要的迫切要求和可能举办的集体劳保事业是什么？如何办？都缺少了解和研究。在实行劳保的办法和制度上也还存有问题，如基金的保存以企业工厂为主，省市职工总会对当地国营企业劳保工作的职责权力没解决，职工领取劳保金的手续还不简便，及目前劳保金支出比例不大，享受利益人数不多等情况，都需要很好研究解决。
    四、半年来实行劳保工作的体验
    一、劳动保险制度比较顺利的建立和实行，是由于党、行政、工会的一致动员，有明确具体的法令条例，和依靠与发挥了广大职工群众的力量。中共东北局、东北政委会、东北职工总会的决定、命令和通知，贯彻到各企业工厂的党、行政和职工会，并以各级劳保委员会把各方面力量组织起来，保证了工作的顺利进行。在职工中进行广泛的宣传，开办劳保训练班，工会小组建立劳保干事，组织大家讨论研究，进行登记，这样组织与发挥了群众的力量，工作进行就顺利。
    二、开始实施劳动保险制度，必须有相当的条件和比较充分的准备。在工厂没有正式恢复，生产不正常，人员不固定，管理制度不健全，工人没有相当的发动和组织的情况下，就正式建立劳保制度是比较困难，也不是十分紧迫和必要的。在准备工作方面，如医疗设备和职工的思想准备与劳保组织等比较成熟些，实行就会更好。在东北由于医疗问题没有比较适当周到的解决，实行中引起职工不少的意见；不少单位由于部分职工认识还不正确（存有过高要求），因而减低了实行的效果。
    三、实行劳动保险必须注意宣传教育，和生产的具体情况，及职工的情绪要求紧密结合。如果只是单纯的个别的发给劳保金，不注意对本人和一般职工的宣传教育，不结合鼓励推动解决当前生产任务，不研究结合职工的情绪要求，实行的效果就会减低，劳保工作就不能提高。
