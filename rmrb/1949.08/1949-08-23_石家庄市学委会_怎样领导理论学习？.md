The Shijiazhuang Municipal Learning Committee, since summarizing the theoretical studies of January and February in early March, and addressing the shortcomings in leadership in the past, has proposed several methods to strengthen the guidance of theoretical study. Since their implementation, they have been quite effective. Excerpts are published here for reference by other regions.

　　(1) Establish core groups to assist the Learning Committee in guiding study: Core groups are formed by cadres with higher theoretical levels from each unit to guide other groups with their own learning experience. Since implementation, core groups have generally been able to strengthen their own learning, promptly disseminating their learning experiences, methods, and research questions to other groups, and providing assistance to comrades with learning difficulties. The core groups try their best to research and answer questions raised by each group, and only submit them to the Municipal Learning Committee when they cannot be resolved, overcoming the phenomenon of units not conducting research and discussion and reporting problems upwards. As a result, the learning effect has improved a step further.

　　(2) Regularly hold lectures and answer questions: Taking advantage of the city's concentrated conditions, learning lectures are held during the study of each chapter, with the Municipal Learning Committee assigning special personnel to lecture, guiding everyone to quickly grasp the center of the problem and its connection to reality, generally twice a month. The Municipal Learning Committee also pays close attention to answering questions raised by various units. The methods of answering questions include: written and oral; collective and individual; answering by telephone; and publishing in newspapers. In order to directly and in detail answer certain important questions to all cadres, "Question Answering Day" is scheduled on Saturdays, when the Municipal Learning Committee designates special personnel and locations to answer prepared questions, striving to answer every question.

　　(3) Enrich "Learning Correspondence": Shortly after the start of theoretical study, the Municipal Learning Committee published irregular "Learning Correspondence" special pages in the Shijiazhuang Daily to reflect learning dynamics, exchange experiences, and answer questions; in addition to contributions from various units, each issue also commissioned special contributions, or was written by responsible comrades of the Municipal Learning Committee. The content includes reading methods, experience introductions, reading notes, lecture records, question discussions, reference materials, learning plans, etc., which have played a certain role in guiding learning.

　　(4) Improve testing: In the study of A Brief History of Social Development, a test was held in the middle of the study, and another test was conducted after the end of the study. This time, the test accepted the previous experience, carried out a general review before the test, and issued a general review question to avoid failing to grasp the center. The test questions focused on the cadres' understanding of the brief history, and the questions were enlightening and expansive. A total of 1,255 cadres participated in this test. The standard answers were also announced after the test. Generally, cadres reflected: "This review and test have made us understand much more deeply"; some cadres said: "After this exam, the harvest is more substantial than reading books for several months"; some cadres' test scores were not very good, but after looking at the answers, they also clarified the problem. This test truly achieved the purpose of deepening the study, and also played a normal motivating role in the learning mood, proving that: periodic testing must be regarded as a method to promote deep understanding of learning, and must be prepared, and the questions must be appropriate, in order to guide everyone on the correct path of learning; absolutely should not regard the test as a simple "stimulus" and randomly issue questions.

### 石家庄市学委会　怎样领导理论学习？

　　石家庄市学委会
  　怎样领导理论学习？
    石家庄市学委会，自三月初总结了一、二两月份理论学习，并针对以往领导上的缺陷，提出加强指导理论学习的几点方法，实行以来，都还比较有效，特摘要发表，供各地参考。
    （一）建立核心小组，辅助学委会指导学习：由各单位理论水平较高的干部组成核心小组，以自己学习经验指导其他小组。实行以来，各核心小组，一般均能加强本身学习，把本组学习经验、方法、和研究的问题及时传播到各小组，并能对学习有困难的同志分头给以帮助。各小组提出的问题，都尽可能的由核心小组研究后予以解答，解决不了的才提交市学委会，克服了本单位不加研究讨论，有问题就往上报的现象，因而学习效果提高了一步。
    （二）定期举行讲座与解答问题：利用城市集中的条件，在学习每章的过程中，举办学习讲座，由市学委指派专人去讲，引导大家较快地掌握问题的中心和联系实际，一般每月举行两次。市学委并十分注意解答各单位所提问题，解答问题的方式：有书面的和口头的；有集体的和个别的；有用电话回答的，有在报纸发表的。为了直接地、详细地向全体干部解答某些重要问题，并规定星期六为“解答问题日”，届时由市学委会指定专人，指定地点去解答准备好了的问题，尽量地作到有问必答。
    （三）充实“学习通讯”：理论学习开始不久，市学委即在石家庄日报出刊不定期的“学习通讯”专页，以反映学习动态，交流经验，解答问题；除各单位来稿外，每期并特约撰稿，或由市学委负责同志亲自执笔写稿。内容有读书方法、经验介绍、读书笔记、讲座纪录、问题讨论、参考资料、学习计划等。在指导学习上，发生了一定作用。
    （四）改进测验：社会发展简史的学习，在学习中间曾举行过一次测验，在学习结束后又进行了一次测验。这次测验接受前次经验，测验前进行总复习，并印发了总复习题，以免抓不住中心。测验时所出测验题，着重干部对简史的理解程度，题目都带有启发性与发挥性。参加这次测验的干部共达一千二百五十五人。测验后并公布了标准答案。一般干部反映：“这次复习和测验使我们了解的深刻多了”；有的干部说：“经过这次考试，比我看几个月书的收获还实在得多”；有的干部考试成绩虽然并不算好，但在看答案后，也把问题弄清楚了。这次测验真正达到了把学习深入一步的目的，对学习情绪也起了正常的激励作用，证明了：必须把定期测验看成是推动学习深刻领会的一个方法，必须是有准备的，出题是恰当的，才能引导大家走上正确的学习道路；绝不应把测验只看成是一个单纯的“刺激”而随意的乱出题。
