　　I. Aggression Against China by Following or Through Other Countries (Continued from Part 3)

　　By 1876, Japan and Korea had already signed the Treaty of Ganghwa, and Japan's influence in Korea was growing. By 1880, the U.S. government believed there was an opportunity to exploit, but given that its past policy of using force against Korea had not been effective, it changed its approach. It instructed Navy Commodore Robert Shufeldt to negotiate with Japan again, asking them to introduce the U.S. for trade with Korea. Japan, which was continuing to pressure Korea, was eager to find foreign support and quickly agreed. Korea, however, refused, citing that it had not received permission from the Qing government. The U.S. then sent Shufeldt to China to lobby, and with the introduction of Li Hongzhang, the U.S.-Korea Treaty was signed in the spring of 1882 (the eighth year of the Guangxu reign). At the start of negotiations, the Qing government wanted to include the phrase "Korea is a tributary state of China" in the treaty. The U.S. government wanted to separate Korea from China and firmly opposed this. The draft note that Shufeldt prepared to present to the Qing government stated:

    "Now, regarding the original Article 1 proposed by Korea, stating that Korea is a tributary state of China but has always been able to manage its internal and external affairs independently, the United States can certainly sign a treaty with Korea without recognizing Korea as a tributary state of China...If Chinese wording is cited, it would be irrelevant to the main purpose and would easily cause doubts, which is not in line with the U.S.'s intention of prudent diplomacy."

    The Qing government refused to comply, and the U.S. threatened to break off negotiations. When Li Hongzhang submitted a "Memorial on Preparing for the U.S.-Korea Treaty" to Emperor Dai (Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty), he said that the American envoy "firmly refused to accept the statement in Article 1 that Korea is a tributary state of China, his intention was very resolute..." The U.S.'s intention to separate Korea from China was not only for trade convenience with Korea, but its main purpose was to interfere in Korean internal affairs through Japan.

    In 1884, France attacked Annam, provoking the Sino-French War. The U.S. attempted to profit from this through France. Before the French forces were fully concentrated, the U.S., through its naval commander, used "mediation" as a delaying tactic for France. After French General Courbet defeated the Qing army at Mawei, the U.S. again made various demands from the Qing government, saying that "the French head of state has instructed Courbet to do his utmost," and if China did not provide compensation of "eighty million francs," it would have to give "other" benefits. In the same year, the U.S. also colluded with Japan to pressure Korea, instigating pro-Japanese (American) factions to coerce the Korean King to separate from China and implement independence. Yuan Shikai, the Qing government's representative in Korea, seeing the unfavorable situation, first submitted a secret report to the government, informing them that "Takezoe Shinichiro (Japanese Minister to Korea) is changing troops and bringing defense, and will arrive in eight or nine days. Shufeldt (U.S. representative) is already in the East, and it is said he will arrive together..." The Qing government was in fact powerless. After Takezoe's troops arrived, pro-Japanese (American) faction leaders Kim Ok-gyun, Park Young-hyo, and others plotted a coup, massacring many ministers in a "Hongmen Banquet" style, kidnapping the Korean King, and seizing power. Yuan Shikai and others sent troops to clash with the Japanese, and the rebels were defeated and retreated. Park Young-hyo and others fled, and the U.S. took them in. A year later, Yuan Shikai telegraphed the Qing court: "Recently, a letter from the Korean internal affairs office stated that Park Young-hyo, Seo Gwang-beom, and Jae-pil, the three traitors who initiated the rebellion last winter, have successively fled from Japan to the United States." The traitorous authorities of the Manchu Qing government naturally would not have a correct understanding of the sinister face of the American aggressors. They still thought that Americans were "peaceful in nature" and that being pro-American was the right thing for Korea to do. Three years later, in 1887 (the eleventh year of the Guangxu reign), Augustine Heard, as the U.S. envoy to Korea, presided over the activities of the Korean traitorous "Enlightenment Party," inciting rumors, and its power was extremely rampant. By 1890, the U.S., through Japan, had reached a climax in seizing Korean internal affairs.

    At this time, the U.S. also formulated a huge plan for the Qing government's "New Policies" in the Chinese mainland. After China's defeat in the Sino-French War, some elements in the Qing government influenced by foreign capitalism, such as Li Hongzhang, wanted to use some reforms to save the crisis of the Manchu Qing ruling class. Around 1889, they began to advocate implementing "New Policies" and establishing a navy. The U.S. seized this opportunity to enter, and an American businessman in Tianjin contacted Li Hongzhang's secretary, Ma Xiangbo, stipulating that the U.S.-China loan was 25 million taels of silver. First, a bank would be opened as the economic "nerve center," and the funds for all "New Policies" would be disbursed from this bank. The headquarters would be set up in Tianjin and Shanghai, with branches in various provinces. The right to audit accounts would be shared by both the U.S. and China. After the agreement was reached, the U.S. government even more enthusiastically welcomed Ma Xiangbo to the U.S. to make the final decision, and increased the loan amount by another 25 million taels, totaling 50 million taels, as a formal loan. In addition, there were 300 million taels in deposits, prepared for expenditure at any time. If this loan had succeeded, the U.S. would have obtained control over all of the Qing government's "New Policies," including the navy, which would have been more convenient for jointly attacking China with Japan in the future. However, when it was about to be realized, Li Hongzhang sent a telegram to the U.S., stating that "the court is in an uproar, public opinion is boiling, and it is impossible to approve," and Ma Xiangbo had to flee to England.

    In Korea, at this time, due to the step-by-step pressure from the U.S. and Japan, Korea's centrifugal force from China was increasing day by day. A large number of Americans were secretly recommended by Japan, and they controlled Korea's internal affairs, diplomacy, military, and other powers. They also used loans as bait to obtain special interests in Korean mining and customs. From March 1890 (the sixteenth year of the Guangxu reign) to January of the following year, Yuan Shikai, the Qing government's acting representative in Korea, sent a flurry of urgent telegrams. The important ones include:

    March 6th (February 16th of the Qing calendar): "Former U.S. General Shufeldt once slandered China. Previously, they employed Charles Le Gendre who led Japanese troops to attack Taiwan, and Korea now wants to employ him again..."

    March 10th (February 20th of the Qing calendar): "Korea awarded Charles Le Gendre a second-rank title and appointed him as an assistant in the royal household."

    March 12th (February 22nd of the Qing calendar): "Heezai came to talk, Charles Le Gendre once led Japanese troops to attack Taiwan, and Korea yesterday granted him an official position. It must have been secretly recommended by the Japanese court. It is said that they will loan 2 million, using customs as collateral, and also send Le Gendre to the tax bureau."

    May 10th (April 20th of the Qing calendar): "The King recently sent petty officials Min Ju-ho and others to the American embassy for extremely confidential discussions...Regarding the U.S. warship sending fifty troops to Hansung, I have already telegraphed it. Recently, they are still drilling daily at the American embassy, and the King has sent officials to provide them with ample supplies, intending to deploy them at any time."

    May 17th (April 27th of the Qing calendar): "Recently, a close Korean minister secretly informed that Denny (former U.S. consul to Korea) repeatedly instructed favored minister Han Gyu-cheol to ask the King to retain him, and said: If Denny is retained, he can control China...A close Korean minister also said: The Korean King repeatedly planned to deploy U.S. troops in the Korean camp outside the palace gate, but the elders strongly advised against it...Korean courtiers quite criticize the King and hate the Americans."

    July 1st (May 15th of the Qing calendar): "Charles Le Gendre now says that an American bank has promised to loan one million yuan, but Korea must agree to lease and open coal mines."

    August 31st (July 17th of the Qing calendar): "There is an American tycoon named Horace Allen, who once served as the U.S. Consul General in Yokohama. He came to Korea yesterday from Japan. It is said that he was recruited by Charles Le Gendre. The Korean court plans to appoint him as an assistant in the foreign affairs office and also handle mining affairs, perhaps because Allen started his career in mining and is quite skilled."

    January 4, 1891 (November 24 of the Qing calendar): "The Korean King has appointed American Horace Allen as the Internal Affairs Assistant, also handling foreign legal matters. Koreans translate his name as Gu Li Yun."

　　美国侵华史
    刘大年　
　　一　追随或通过别国向中国侵略（续三）
    当一八七六年时，日韩已缔结江华条约，日本在朝鲜势力日渐澎涨。至一八八○年，美政府以为有机可乘，但鉴于过去对朝鲜的武力政策没有收到效果，乃改变方式，使水师提督薛裴尔再与日本商议，请向朝鲜介绍，准许美国通商，日本正继续对朝鲜进逼，急欲引用外援，很快同意。朝鲜却以未得清政府允许，仍然拒绝，美国即派薛斐尔来中国活动，得李鸿章介绍于一八八二年（光绪八年）春订立美韩条约。开始交涉时，清政府要于约内载明“朝鲜为中国属邦”字样，美政府要使朝鲜脱离中国，对此坚决反对，薛斐尔所拟向清政府提出的照会说：
    “今按朝鲜原拟第一款，朝鲜系中国属邦，而内政外交向来得以自主，是在美国固可与朝鲜订约，不必认朝鲜为中国属邦……如引用中国字样，与本旨既不相涉，而复易滋疑义，殊非美国慎重邦交之意。”
    清政府不从，美国以破裂谈判相威胁，李鸿章向戴＠（清光绪帝）上“筹办朝美议约摺”时说：美使“于第一款声明朝鲜为中国属邦，坚不允从，意甚决绝……”。美国之所以要使朝鲜脱离中国，固然为了对朝鲜通商方便，但其主要目的，还在通过日本去干涉朝鲜内政。
    一八八四年，法国进攻安南，挑起中法战争，美国企图通过法国从中取利。当法军还未集中以前，美国由水师提督以“调处”方式替法国行使缓兵之计。及法将孤拔把清军大败于马尾，美国又出面向清政府多方要挟，说“法国国主有谕旨给孤拔尽力从事”，如中国不给“八十兆弗朗”的赔偿，就要“另给别项”利益。同年，美国又协同日本乘机向朝鲜进迫，嗾使亲日（美）派挟制韩王脱离中国，实行自主。清廷驻朝鲜帮办袁世凯见形势不利，先向政府上一个密禀，告以“竹添进一郎（日驻韩公使）换兵带防，八九日必到，薛斐尔（美代表）已在东洋，闻将偕至……。”清政府事实上已无能为力，竹添等兵到之后，亲日（美）派首领金玉均，朴永孝等即布置发难，以“鸿门宴”方式屠杀大臣多人，劫持韩王夺取政权。袁世凯等出兵与日本冲突，乱党又败退，朴永孝等亡命，由美国予以收留。事后一年，袁世凯电告清廷：“顷朝鲜内署来信，去冬倡乱之朴永孝、徐光范、载弼三贼，先后逃日本往美国。”满清卖国政府当局，对美国侵略者的狰狞面目，自然不会有正确认识，他们还以为美国人是“性气和平”，朝鲜亲美是对的。一八八五年（光绪十一年）李鸿章与伊滕博文订立天津条约后给朝鲜政府一信，替它策划今后，有云：“闻贵国已托人在美延订教习，美国人向无占据土地兵权之意，性气和平，（！？），雇价亦赚，最为相宜”，可谓至死不悟！此后三年——一八八七年，美国人福久更以美驻韩使节地位，主持朝鲜卖国贼“开化党”的活动，煽惑造谣，势力极为嚣张。到一八九○年，美国通过日本夺取朝鲜内政达到一个高潮。
    就在此时，美国对中国内地也制定了一个庞大的包办清政府“新政”计划。中法战争，中国败北后，清政府中一部分受外国资本主义影响的分子如李鸿章之流，想用某些改良办法来挽救满清统治阶级的危机，一八八九年前后开始提倡改行“新政”，创办海军，美国便乘机而入，由在天津的美国商人与李鸿章幕客马相伯接洽，规定中美借款二千五百万两，先开设银行，作经济“总枢”，各项“新政”经费皆由此行出纳，总行设天津、上海，各省设分行，查帐权由中美双方分享。议成后，美政府更热烈欢迎马相伯到美国作最后决定，又增加了二千五百万两的款额，共五千万两，作为正式借款，另外还有三万万两的存款，预备随时支出。如果这个借款成功，美国便可取得清政府全部“新政”支配权，括海军支配权在内，对于今后与日本合力向中国进攻，更为便利。但将要实现时，李鸿章往美国去了一个电报，是“朝议大哗，舆论沸腾，万难照准”，马相伯只好往英国溜之大吉。
    在朝鲜方面，这时由于美日步步进逼，使朝鲜对中国的离心力日益增强，大批美国人先后由日本密荐，掌握了朝鲜的内政、外交、军事等大权，又以贷款作钓饵，取得朝鲜的开矿与海关的特别利益。一八九○年（光绪十六年）三月至第二年一月，清政府驻朝鲜代办袁世凯的告急电报，雪片飞来，重要的有：
    三月六日（清二月十六日）：“美前总兵薛斐尔曾谤华，前延用了李仙得曾导日兵攻台湾，韩又欲延用……。”
    三月十日（清二月二十日）：“韩赏李仙得二品衔，充内署协办。”
    三月十二日（清二月二十二日）：“禧在明来谈，李仙得曾领日兵攻台湾而韩昨授以官，必由日廷密荐，闻将贷款二百万，以海关抵押，并派李充税务局。”
    五月十日（清四月二十日）：“王近派小人闵周镐等梭往美馆，语议极密……至美兵船调兵五十来汉城，前已电禀，近仍在美馆逐日操练，王派员供给甚备，意在随时调卫。”
    五月十七日（清四月二十七日）：“顷韩近臣密告，德尼（美前驻朝鲜领事）叠嘱幸臣韩圭契求王留用，并云：如留德，可制华……韩近臣又云：韩王叠拟调美兵在附宫门外之韩营内，诸老成力谏，乃止……韩廷臣颇议王而恨美人。”
    七月一日（清五月十五日）：“李仙得今谓美银行许贷款百万元，须韩准租开煤矿。”
    八月三十一日（清七月十七日）：“有美巨富名葛累好士，曾充美驻横滨总领事，昨由日来韩，闻系李仙得所招，韩廷拟派充外署协办，兼办矿务，或以葛开矿起家，颇诸练。”
    一八九一年一月四日（清十一月二十四日）：“韩王派美国人葛累好士为内务协办，兼办外国法律事，韩译包其名为具礼云。”
