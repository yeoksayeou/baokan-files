　　After Reading "Smoke of the Homeland"
    Jin Feng
    At the National Youth Congress, a gift was sent from the Northeast to the representatives: a copy of the new work by the famous Soviet writer Simonov, "Smoke of the Homeland," for each person. This is a very precious and appropriate gift, and it is worth introducing to the youth of the whole country.
    "Even the smoke of the homeland, we feel it is so kind, fragrant, and sweet..." Starting with this old Russian verse, a Soviet youth who had been working abroad for three years returned home. Recalling the ugliness he had seen in the decadent and degenerate capitalist America, hidden under the guise of "civilization," and the struggle he had been relentlessly and tirelessly engaged in for three years. When he returned to the Soviet Union, oh, how strongly did he feel, from the bottom of his heart, the deep love for his motherland, just as a son, after being away from his mother, returns home and cherishes his mother's love even more. Through the protagonist's mother (an old Soviet school teacher and a guerrilla fighter during the German-Soviet War), younger brother (a student at a mechanical school who gloriously lost a leg for the motherland), and wife (a nurse during and after the war)—these few ordinary but also glorious images among millions of Soviet citizens—a contrast between two different worlds is portrayed: on one side, there is a conspiracy for war, having just drunk the wine of victory with the Soviet Union in Berlin, but on the other side, in New York's Wall Street, knives are being sharpened, seeking profits in the bones of peaceful residents of the world (including America), thus resorting to the most vicious and shameless slander and defamation of the Soviet Union, the fortress of peace; on this side, there is the tide of construction, with the whole nation throwing themselves into it with selfless enthusiasm—rebuilding the beautiful motherland from the rubble. Besides this, socialist Soviet Union is not yet perfect; there are still sunspots on the sun, and there are still worms in the new society that has emerged from the old society. That is the protagonist's brother-in-law and the protagonist's wife's first husband. They are still representatives of the remnants of bourgeois ideology, working diligently only for their own and their families' comfortable lives, seeking only profit, pursuing material enjoyment when everyone is having a difficult time, and worshiping the "material civilization" of America. But they are all forty or fifty years old, and in the Soviet Union, they are the representatives of the last generation of old people, unable to germinate and reproduce; moreover, in a sound and reasonable society, they have become "illegal existences." They have to hide those ugly thoughts from the bottom of their hearts, although they are still inevitably exposed, and even their wives and children despise them from afar. They can only work and eat, standing alone in Soviet society, and new people will soon replace their positions.
    What runs through the entire book is the strong patriotic spirit of the Soviet people. The author Simonov writes in the postscript about his love for the motherland, and that of countless Soviet people: "This book is dedicated to you as a part of my life, and my entire life is also dedicated to you. And my life—is only one of those countless lives, those countless lives are all dedicated to you in the same way. These lives—no matter where they are and what they are doing, whether at a desk or on the battlefield, whether wielding a hammer or holding a plow, are all dedicated to you." The author profoundly describes the Soviet people's selfless defense of their motherland during the war, and their tenacious and arduous immediate efforts to restore construction after the war. Their belief is: "For our motherland!" Here, "motherland" is not an abstract concept, but is embodied in the beloved homeland, the warm family, the mother, brothers, and wife who have the same ideals and beliefs, vodka, and cigarettes with paper covers—these living people and things. It is embodied in the cold streets of Smolensk, the protagonist's hometown, and the trenches that have not been cleared. People want to rebuild Smolensk—their homes, and are willing to build them on the previous old sites measured by the steps of memory. This is "motherland" and people's love for her! Motherland, whether she is blooming with fragrant flowers, or scorched earth after being ravaged by the enemy, is always the motherland where the working people are "born and raised," bleed for her, and sweat for her. This is repeatedly stated in the book. Secondly, the book describes in such detail the excellent Soviet people—the expression of the most beautiful desires of mankind: that collectivist spirit that condenses hundreds of millions of people into one, the irreconcilability of struggle against the enemy, the love of work, the loyalty to the people, the contempt for vulgar life enjoyment, the tenacious conquest of difficulties, the unusually honest facing of reality, and the lack of consideration for personal gains and losses. These constitute such a prominent, clear, beautiful, and dazzling picture of the individual merging into the collective, which is in stark contrast to that capitalist society where money can eat away at people's souls. There, thousands of people live "alone" (in the sense of absolute loneliness), isolated from each other, pushing each other out, biting each other, fighting each other, killing their own fathers for a bag of gold, living without relatives or friends. Under the shining of the noble and fearless spirit of the Soviet people, patriotism is even more prominently displayed.
    What does "Smoke of the Homeland" teach us? Looking at it, we, the Chinese people, are also carrying out the magnificent undertaking of building a new democratic country, unprecedented in Chinese history. We are going to establish a prosperous and glorious new life in a country that has been squeezed by domestic and foreign rulers for so many years, and is therefore so backward, poor, and disaster-ridden. Our motherland was originally rich and beautiful, her benevolent bosom nurtured our five thousand years of culture, and fed our 475 million people. Now it is full of wounds and needs each of us to feed it with blood and sweat. It will last forever in the world, bright and immortal. The youth of our country, who have little combat experience, do not have a sufficient understanding of this. Our beloved motherland has been insulted and damaged by the reactionaries, but its glory has not been weakened by countless violent intrusions in history, and in the past hundred years, our loyal ancestors have shed their blood, one after another, for the independence and freedom of our motherland. In the 1950s, finally, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people who had gone through hardships and struggles turned over and became masters. Young people, let us love our motherland like the Soviet youth! Dig out the evil thoughts that have poisoned us for a hundred years by imperialism and reactionary forces, and don't let even a little bit of it remain. We believe in our motherland, which has nurtured us for five thousand years, and we believe in the hands of our 475 million people. Our older generation has cleared the obstacles on the road ahead for us. Let us learn and work in various positions, and never forget for a moment that this is for our beloved motherland. We must think: at this same moment, on the vast land of our motherland, we have 475 million people sweating and bleeding for the motherland. Like the Soviet Union, we must build mansions on the ruins and let flowers bloom all over the motherland!
    At the same time, the reason why the new patriotism is deeply rooted in the marrow of the Soviet people is that the working people have built this country over the past thousands of years, opened up mines and rivers, created a brilliant culture, defended it when enemies invaded, and in the 1920s, became the masters of their own country for the first time, becoming a benchmark and a direction for the working people of the world. Therefore, in the book, the brilliance of that internationalist spirit shines from time to time in the huge mirror of patriotism: for example, a division commander during the Soviet-German War was a military commissar of a regiment who had participated in the Spanish Revolution. The protagonist in the book happened to meet a Spanish exile in the United States who was the commander of that Spanish Revolutionary Army at the time. He said without hesitation: if he had fled to the Soviet Union at that time, he would have been very happy to fight side by side with his old comrade-in-arms, the military commissar, to defend the Soviet Union; another example is an American sailor who happily showed the protagonist his certificate of blood transfusion for Soviet soldiers. This proves that the working people of the whole world love and respect each other. True patriotism is closely linked with internationalism. And this also educates the Chinese youth to be good at understanding and carrying forward this great spirit of internationalism!

　　“祖国炊烟”读后
    金凤
    在全国青年代表大会上，从东北送来了赠给代表们的礼物，每人一本苏联名作家西蒙诺夫的新作：“祖国炊烟”。这是非常宝贵恰当的礼物，值得介绍给全国的青年。
    “就是祖国的炊烟，我们也感觉亲切香甜……”以这样的俄国的古老的诗句开头，一个在国外工作了三年的苏联青年回家了。回忆着他在那腐朽、堕落的资本主义美国所看到的种种包在“文明”外衣下的丑恶和三年来他所从未松懈、不疲倦地进行着的斗争。当他一回到苏联，呵，何等强烈地他从心底唤起的对祖国底深挚的情爱，正如儿子在远离母亲以后回家来益增其对于母爱的眷恋一样。通过主角的母亲（一个苏联老女教师和德苏战争时候的游击队员）、弟弟（为祖国光荣地失了一条腿的机械学校的学生）和妻子（战时和战后的护士）这些千百万苏维埃公民中的几个平凡的但也光辉的形象，刻划出了两个不同世界的对比：那边是阴谋战争，刚在柏林和苏联同饮胜利之酒，另一面却在纽约华尔街磨刀霍霍，要在世界（包括美国）和平居民的白骨中追逐利润，因此不惜最恶毒无耻地诬蔑中伤和平堡垒的苏联；这边是全国的人民以忘我的热情投入建设的热潮——从瓦砾堆中重建美丽的祖国。除此以外，社会主义的苏联也还不能十全十美，太阳上尚有黑点，从旧社会中蜕化出来的新社会中也还有蠹鱼存在，那就是主角的姊夫和主角妻子的第一个丈夫，他们还都是资产阶级残余思想的代表，只是为了自己和家庭的舒适生活而勤勉做工，唯利是图，在大家生活困难的时候讲究物质享受，崇拜美国的“物质文明”。但他们都是四五十岁的人了，在苏联那已是旧人物的最后一代的代表，不能发芽繁殖的了；而且在健全合理的社会中也都成为“非法的存在”，他们要从心底隐瞒起那些丑恶的思想，虽然终究还是不免要暴露出来，连妻子和儿女都远远地鄙弃他们，只是还能做工吃饭，孤零零地站在苏维埃社会之中，新的人物很快就要代替他们的位置。
    贯串了全书的是强烈地苏联人民底爱国主义精神。作者西蒙诺夫在书后这样写着他和那无数苏联人民对于祖国的热爱：“这本书作为生命的一部分奉献给你，我的全部生命同样也是奉献给你的。而我的生命—仅只是那些无数生命之一，那些无数生命都是一模一样地奉献给你的，它们—这些生命不论在什么地方进行着什么事都是一样：在书桌旁边或在战场上，是抡起钉锤的或是扶犁杖的，都是献给你的。”而作者在书中深刻地描写着苏联人民在战时奋不顾身地保卫着自己的祖国，在战后顽强艰苦地立刻着手恢复建设，他们的信念就是一个：“为我们的祖国”！在这里，“祖国”并不是抽象的概念，而是体现在可爱的家乡的土地，温暖的家庭，具有同一理想和信念的母亲、兄弟和妻子，伏特加酒，带纸套的烟卷这些活生生的人和事上面；体现在主角家乡斯摩棱斯克寒冷的街道，没有清除了的战壕上面的。人们要重建斯摩棱斯克——他们的家屋，愿意建立在用记忆的脚步所量出来的以前的旧址上，这就是“祖国”和人们对她的热爱！祖国，不管她是盛开的芬芳的鲜花，还是遭受了敌人底蹂躏后的焦土，总是劳动人民“生于斯，长于斯”，为它流血，为它流汗的祖国。这一点在书里是反反复复地讲了的。其次，书中是如此详尽地描述着优秀的苏联人民——人类最美好的欲望的表现：那千百万人凝炼为一体的集体主义精神，对敌斗争的不可调和性，对工作的热爱，对人民的忠诚，对庸俗的生活享受的鄙视，对困难的顽强的征服，异常诚实的正视现实，没有个人利害得失的打算，这些构成了这样一幅突出明朗美丽夺目底个人溶入集体的图画，恰好与那金钱就能吃掉人的灵魂底资本主义社会成一鲜明对比。那里几千几万人都是一个个隔离着“孤独”地（在绝对的孤独的意义上）生活着，彼此排挤着，咬着，打着，为着一袋金子杀死自己的父亲，没有亲人也没有朋友地活着；这些，在苏联人民高尚无畏的精神照耀下，爱国主义就更凸出地表现了出来。
    “祖国炊烟”教育了我们什么呢？看着，我们中国人民也正在进行壮丽的中国历史上空前的建设新民主主义国家的伟业，我们要在一个被本国和外国的统治者榨压了多少年代，以致如此落后贫困灾难深重的国度里建立起富足辉煌的新生活来。我们的祖国也原是丰厚美丽的，她仁慈的胸怀孕育了我们五千年的文化，哺育着我们四万万七千五百万人民，如今它满身疮痍，需要我们每个人以血汗来喂养它，它将在世界上永存无疆，灿烂不朽。对于这一点，我国的甚少战斗经历的青年们是体会得还很不够的。我们亲爱的祖国，是被反动派们侮辱和损害了的，但它的光辉在历史上无数次被强暴的侵入都没有涣散，而在一百年来，我们忠于祖国的先烈们更是前仆后继地为求祖国的独立、自由而流尽鲜血。五十年代的中国，终于，在中国共产党的领导下，历经风霜苦斗的人民翻身作了主人。青年们，让我们象苏联的青年们一样热爱我们的祖国！在脑袋里挖出那些百年来帝国主义和反动势力毒害我们的罪恶思想吧，那怕是一点点也不要让它存留着。我们相信我们五千年哺育了我们的祖国，我们相信四万万七千五百万人民的双手，我们的老一辈已为我们清扫了前进道路上的障碍，让我们在各种各样的岗位上学习着，工作着，一时一刻不要忘记了这是为了我们亲爱的祖国，要想着：在这同时同刻内，在我们祖国辽阔的大地上，我们有四万万七千五百万人民齐为了祖国流汗流血，象苏联一样，要在废墟上建筑起大厦，让祖国开遍鲜花！
    同时，新的爱国主义之所以深入苏联人民骨髓，这是因为劳动人民在过去千百年来就建立起这个国家，开辟了矿山、河流、创立了灿烂文化，在敌人侵犯的时候保卫了它，在二十世纪的二十年代，第一次做了自己国家的主人，成为全世界劳动人民的一个指标，一个方向。因此，在书中那国际主义的精神的光采就时时在爱国主义的巨大的明镜中闪耀出来：如苏德战时的一位师长是参加过西班牙革命的团军事委员，书中主角恰好在美国碰见了西班牙的流亡者就是当时那个西班牙革命军的团长，他毫不迟疑地说着：假如那时流亡到了苏联，他会很愉快地和他以前的老战友军事委员并肩作战保卫苏联的；又如一个美国水手高兴地对着主角拿出了他为苏联士兵输血的证书；这证明全世界的劳动人民是互相友爱互相尊重的。真正的爱国主义是和国际主义紧紧结合着的。而这也同时教育了中国的青年们，要善于体会和发扬这种伟大底国际主义的精神！
