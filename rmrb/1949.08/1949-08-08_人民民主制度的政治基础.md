The Political Foundation of People's Democratic System
By T. Chorgescu, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party
Translated by Gu Cheng

Editor's Note: China's People's Democratic System has both similarities and differences with the People's Democratic Systems of Eastern European countries. The similarities are that both are led by the proletariat and based on the alliance of the working people. China's People's Democratic System includes the patriotic national bourgeoisie in the government, and in its economic policy, it only eliminates bureaucratic capitalism without eliminating general capitalism. This is because China's industrial production is very backward, and it needs the national bourgeoisie to participate in the common cause of developing production. Moreover, the Chinese national bourgeoisie is also willing to participate in the united front against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. The situation in North Korea and Vietnam is roughly similar. Eastern Europe has a different situation. The People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe, namely Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania, have relatively developed industries, while the bourgeoisie stood on the side of German-Italian fascism and Anglo-American imperialism, opposing the People's Democratic Revolution. Therefore, in these countries, the People's Democratic Dictatorship is a form of the Proletarian Dictatorship. After the anti-fascist war and with the assistance of the Soviet Union, the proletariat in these countries overthrew the reactionary rule of the bourgeoisie and are gradually eliminating capitalist economy and entering socialism. This article explains the content of the People's Democratic System in Eastern Europe.

What is the class content of a People's Democratic state?

The Romanian Workers' Party, when establishing the People's Democratic System, was guided, like other New Democratic countries, by the theories of Lenin, namely: that during the transition from capitalism to socialism, no matter how different the forms may be, the essence of these forms must be the same - the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The characteristics of the historical development of each country and its national characteristics are also the reasons for the somewhat different forms in the progress of each country towards socialism. However, overemphasizing the importance of the characteristics of individual countries represents an opportunistic and nationalistic tendency, which in essence will lead to abandoning Marxism-Leninism and its basic content - the dictatorship of the proletariat.

People's democracy is a form of the dictatorship of the proletariat. However, the working class of the People's Democratic countries in alliance with the laboring peasants was able to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat without civil war, which is what differentiates it from the Soviet revolution. The People's Democratic countries were able to do so because the Soviet Union won a historic victory in World War II, and because the armed forces of the socialist countries heroically carried out their international duty to the laboring people, liberating these countries.

The rapid growth of Soviet state power brought about a change in the balance of power between capitalism and socialism in the international situation in favor of socialism. The Soviet Union's great victory in World War II and its political and economic assistance to the liberated countries enabled these countries to move forward along the path of people's democracy. All attempts by the imperialists to restore the capitalist system in the People's Democratic countries have been shattered by the people's determination to defend their freedom and independence - their freedom and independence are built on the foundation of brotherly alliance and consolidated friendship with the invincible Soviet state. Because the People's Democratic countries have the support of the Soviet Union, the imperialists have not been able to carry out naked armed intervention against them, as they did against the young Soviet state from 1918 to 1920.

Therefore, today, there are two different forms of the dictatorship of the proletariat: the Soviet form and the People's Democratic form. The Soviet form is a higher form of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The political foundation of the People's Democratic System and the political foundation of the Soviet System are built on different conditions. The Great October Socialist Revolution completely smashed the old state machine and handed over power to the Soviets, thus creating a higher form of socialist state - the Soviet state.

The historical characteristics of the development of the Romanian revolution, like those of other People's Democratic countries, are that the old state machine was not immediately smashed.

Due to the special conditions of its beginning and subsequent development, the People's Democratic country represents a new regime in which components of the old bourgeois state machine continue to exist for a certain period.

Taking Romania as an example, after liberation, the proletariat waged a fierce struggle to win positions in state institutions, because the bourgeoisie and landlords knew that losing these positions would mean their own defeat and destruction.

However, a thorough reorganization of the state machine was only possible after a long struggle. After the workers consolidated their positions, they drove the fascists and reactionaries out of state institutions. The class content of state institutions gradually changed as large numbers of workers were absorbed. This process was greatly accelerated after the working class, in alliance with the laboring peasants, abolished autocracy and completely seized power. The old army, the old judiciary, and the organs of suppression - the police and the gendarmerie - were all abolished and replaced by new people's organs.

But only the establishment of People's Representative Conferences - local organs of power built on a broad democratic foundation - could create new state institutions that, from top to bottom, in all aspects, conformed to the purposes and tasks of the new state and were adapted to the task of building socialism.

The Soviet of Workers' Representatives is the political foundation of the Soviet Union. The new organs of power - the People's Representative Conferences - are the political foundation of the People's Democratic countries. The establishment of People's Representative Conferences marks the fact that the People's Democracy is approaching the higher form of the dictatorship of the proletariat - the Soviet form - in form. This type of organ of power already exists in Bulgaria and is being established in other People's Democratic countries.

People's Representative Conferences in Romania

The People's Representative Conference represents an unprecedentedly democratic form of government in the history of the Romanian people. It constitutes the political foundation of the People's Democracy - a democracy that serves the vast majority of the people against the minority of oppressors.

The People's Representative Conference must maintain close ties with the masses in order to influence millions of working people and mobilize them to fight for the construction of socialism. Before the election of the People's Representative Conference, the provisional committees at all levels (regions, cities, villages, etc.) that temporarily perform the functions of the Representative Conference are fulfilling these necessary tasks. The Provisional Committee exercises power and is responsible for local economic, social, and cultural activities.

As the sole organ of power in the locality, the People's Representative Conference carries out all its activities in accordance with the principle of democratic centralism, ensuring the strict implementation of the instructions and plans of the central organs of power. At the same time, the Representative Conference must encourage initiative at the lower levels, consider all local specificities and needs, develop the economy, and encourage the people to work hard to build.

The nature of Romania's old organs of power can illustrate the great revolutionary significance of the transition from the old organs of power to the People's Representative Conference.

The old regime in Romania, like all bourgeois states, was divided into legislative and administrative organs. State power was actually in the hands of the administrative organs. The legislative organ - the parliament - had little influence on national life. Local power was concentrated in the hands of officials appointed by the government or the Council of Ministers. County heads and mayors were officials who ruled the people without being accountable to the people. They were only controlled by the central government. The whole apparatus was the best example of bureaucratic government. Peasants had to travel all the way to Bucharest to resolve general issues such as schools and water supply. Letters sent from villages to government departments were lost; even if there was a reply, it would be half a year or more later.

Agricultural, financial, health, and other organs at the district level were not under the jurisdiction of the county head or mayor. Anyone could arbitrarily order the people around, but no one was accountable to the people, and no one represented the people's opinions.

This is a typical example of bourgeois parliamentarianism and bourgeois democracy in all European capitalist countries.

The People's Representative Conference - the political foundation of the People's Democracy - is, in contrast to the anti-people, anti-democratic system, the highest organ of local power (regions, districts, cities, and villages) elected by the people, accountable to the people, controlled by the people, and, if necessary, recallable by the people.

The People's Representative Conference in the New Democratic countries is a new form of political organization led by the working class.

The People's Representative Conference is an organ of the dictatorship of the proletariat. It embodies the organization of all working people, regardless of nationality, race, education, etc.

The People's Representative Conference consistently solves national problems in the spirit of socialism. Another advantage of the People's Representative Conference as an organ of power is that its activities can be combined with the activities of mass organizations - trade unions, cooperatives, youth leagues, etc.

The People's Representative Conference is the most democratic organ of power in these countries. It is also the only organ that can establish the alliance between the working class and all working people, maintain and strengthen the leading role of the proletariat.

The People's Representative Conference is not a specialized deliberative organ of the bourgeois parliamentary type. It is the people's true power, solving political, economic, cultural, and other problems related to the vital interests of the working people every day.

The Romanian Workers' Party regards the development and consolidation of the People's Representative Conference as a top priority, because the establishment of the People's Representative Conference means that it is becoming the real, only, and most important political foundation of the People's Democratic country - which is realizing the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The People's Representative Conference is different from the old administrative system. Its work is built on the vast masses of people who are absorbed into local and state power.

One of the important ways to organize the masses around the provisional committee is through the various committees and civil affairs committees that are currently temporarily performing the functions of the People's Representative Conference. Workers, laboring peasants, housewives, young people, and progressive intellectuals are all absorbed into the work of the provisional committee.

In this way, the People's Representative Conference absorbs countless activists who strengthen the ties between the People's Congress and the masses and absorb the masses into the work of state power. (To be continued)

    人民民主制度的政治基础
    罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记  Ｔ·乔节斯哥
    谷澄译
    编者按：中国的人民民主制度，与东欧各国人民民主制度在性质上有相同的方面，也有不同的方面。两者都以无产阶级为领导者，以劳动人民的联盟为基础，这是相同的。中国的人民民主制度在政权上包含爱国的民族资产阶级在内，在经济政策上仅仅消灭官僚资本主义而不消灭一般的资本主义，这是因为中国工业生产十分落后，需要民族资产阶级参加发展生产的共同事业，而中国民族资产阶级也愿意参加反帝国主义反封建主义反官僚资本主义的统一战线的原故。在北朝鲜和越南，情况也大致相似。在东欧则有不同的情形。东欧的人民民主国家，即捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚，工业比较发展，而资产阶级则先后站在德意法西斯主义和美英法帝国主义方面，反对人民民主革命，所以在这些国家，人民民主专政是无产阶级专政的一种形式。这些国家的无产阶级经过反法西斯战争，经过苏联的援助，推翻了资产阶级的反动统治，并正在或先或后地消灭资本主义经济而进入社会主义。这篇文章所解释的就是东欧人民民主制度的内容。                
    人民民主国家的阶级内容是什么？
    罗马尼亚工人党在建立人民民主制度时，也和其他新民主国家一样，受到列宁以下理论的指导，即：在从资本主义过渡到社会主义期间，无论形式如何不同，这些形式的本质必然是相同的——无产阶级专政。
    各国历史发展的特点及其民族特性，也是造成各国在向社会主义进展中形式多少有些不同的原因。但过分强调个别国家的特点的重要性，本身就代表一种机会主义的和民族主义的倾向，这在本质上会走到舍弃马列主义及其基本内容——无产阶级专政。
    人民民主是无产阶级专政的一种形式。但，与劳动农民联盟的人民民主国家的工人阶级，能够不经过内战就建立起无产阶级专政，这是它和苏联革命不同的地方。人民民主国家所以能够这样做，是因为苏联在第二次世界大战中赢得了历史性的胜利，是因为社会主义国家的武装力量英勇地执行了对于劳动人民的国际义务，解放了这些国家。
    苏联国家力量的飞跃增长，在国际形势上引起资本主义和社会主义力量对比中有利于社会主义的改变。苏联在世界第二次大战中的伟大胜利，和对解放了的国家在政治上和经济上的援助，使这些国家能够沿着人民民主的道路向前发展。帝国主义者在人民民主国家内恢复资本主义制度的一切打算，都被人民保卫自由和独立的决心所粉碎——他们的自由和独立是建筑在与无敌的苏维埃国家兄弟般的联盟和巩固的友谊之基础上的。由于人民民主国家有苏联的支持，帝国主义者曾不能对它们进行赤裸裸的武装干涉，如象从一九一八到一九二○年对年轻的苏维埃国家所作的那样。
    所以，在今天，有两种不同形式的无产阶级专政：苏维埃形式的，和人民民主形式的。苏维埃形式是无产阶级专政的高级形式。
    人民民主制度的政治基础与苏维埃制度的政治基础是建筑在不同的条件上的。伟大的十月社会主义革命，彻底打碎了旧的国家机器，把政权交给苏维埃，因此创造了高级形式的社会主义国家—苏维埃国家。
    罗马尼亚革命发展的历史特点，也和其他人民民主国家的一样，就是并没有立刻打碎旧的国家机器。
    由于开始和以后发展的特殊条件，人民民主国家代表一种新的政权，在这个政权中，旧的资产阶级国家机器的成份，在一定时期内还继续存在着。
    以罗马尼亚为例吧，在解放以后，无产阶级为了争取国家机构内的阵地，曾进行了激烈的斗争，因为资产阶级和地主知道，失去这些阵地将意味着他们自身的失败和毁灭。
    可是，彻底改组国家机器，只有在长期斗争后才有可能。工人巩固了阵地以后，就把法西斯分子和反动派赶出国家机构。国家机构的阶级内容，因大量吸收工人而逐步改变。这个过程，在与劳动农民联盟的工人阶级废除了专制和完全取得政权之后，才大为加速了。旧军队，旧司法机关，镇压机关——警察和宪兵——都取消了，被新的人民的机关所代替。
    但只有建立人民代表会议——建立在广泛的民主基础上的地方政权机关——才能创造出新的国家机构，从上到下，各方面都符合新国家的目的和任务，和适应建立社会主义的任务。
    劳动人民代表苏维埃是苏联的政治基础。新的政权机关——人民代表会议则是人民民主国家的政治基础。人民代表会议的建立标明人民民主在形式上正在接近无产阶级专政的高级形式——苏维埃形式。这种类型的政权机关在保加利亚已经存在，在其他人民民主国家内也正在建立中。
    罗马尼亚的人民代表会议
    人民代表会议代表着罗马尼亚人民历史上空前民主的政权形式，它构成了人民民主的政治基础——这种民主正为反对少数压迫者的绝大多数人民服务。
    人民代表会议必须密切联系群众，才能影响千百万的劳动人民，动员他们为建设社会主义而奋斗。在人民代表会议选举以前，暂时执行代表会议职权的各级临时委员会（地区、城市、乡村等等）正在实现这些必要的任务。临时委员会行使政权，负责当地的经济、社会、文化活动。
    作为当地唯一政权机关的人民代表会议，一切活动都是依据民主集中的原则，保证严格执行中央政权机关的指示和计划。同时，代表会议必须鼓励下层的主动性，考虑一切地方的特殊性和需要，发展经济和鼓励人民努力建设。
    罗马尼亚旧日的政权机关的性质，可以说明从旧的政权机关过渡到人民代表会议的重大革命意义。
    罗马尼亚的旧政权，也和一切资产阶级的国家的一样，分为立法机关和行政机关。国家权力实际上由行政机关掌握。立法机关——议会——对国家生活很少有影响。地方政权集中在政府或部长会议委派的官吏手中。县长和市长是统治人民而不对人民负责的官吏，他们只受中央政府的管制，整套机构正是官僚政府的最好的例子。农民为了解决关于学校，饮水供应等一般问题，就必须远走到布加勒斯特去。从乡村寄到政府各部里的信被遗失了；即或答复，也是在半年或半年多以后。
    区级的农业、财政、卫生等等机关都不归县长或市长管。每个人都可以随便对人民发号施令，却没有人向人民负责，没有人代表人民的意见。
    这是所有欧洲资本主义国家内资产阶级议会主义，资产阶级民主的典型例子。
    人民代表会议——人民民主的政治基础——与反人民、反民主的制度相反，它是由人民选举，向人民负责，受人民控制，且在必要时可以由人民罢免的地方政权（地区、区、城市、乡村）的最高机关。
    新民主国家的人民代表会议是以工人阶级为领导的新的政权组织形式。
    人民代表会议是无产阶级专政的机关。它体现了不分民族、种族、教育等等区别的一切劳动人民的组织。
    人民代表会议一贯用社会主义的精神解决民族问题。作为政权机构的人民代表会议的另一好处，是它的活动能够和群众组织——工会、合作社、青年团等——的活动相结合。
    人民代表会议是这些国家内最民主的政权机关。它同时也是建立工人阶级与一切劳动人民的联盟，维持和加强无产阶级领导作用的唯一机关。
    人民代表会议不是资产阶级议会型的专门发议论的机关。它是人民真正的政权，每天解决着政治、经济、文化和其他有关劳动人民切身利益的问题。
    罗马尼亚工人党把发展和巩固人民代表会议看作是头等重要的工作，因为人民代表会议的建立就意味着它正在成为人民民主国家——它正实现着无产阶级专政——的真正、唯一和最重要的政治基础。
    人民代表会议与旧日的行政制度不同。它的工作建筑在吸收进地方政权和国家政权中的广大人民群众身上。
    把群众组织在临时委员会的周围的重要方法之一，是通过目前暂时执行人民代表会议职权的各种委员会和民政委员会。工人、劳动农民、家庭妇女、青年、进步知识分子都被吸收到临时委员会的工作中。
    人民代表会议就这样吸收无数的积极分子，他们加强人代会与群众的联系，把群众吸收到国家政权工作中来。（未完）
