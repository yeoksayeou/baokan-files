The Political Foundation of People's Democratic System
By T. Chorgescu, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party
Translated by Gu Cheng

Editor's Note: China's People's Democratic System has both similarities and differences with the People's Democratic Systems of Eastern European countries. The similarities are that both are led by the proletariat and based on the alliance of the working people. China's People's Democratic System includes the patriotic national bourgeoisie in the government, and in its economic policy, it only eliminates bureaucratic capitalism without eliminating general capitalism. This is because China's industrial production is very backward, and it needs the national bourgeoisie to participate in the common cause of developing production. Moreover, the Chinese national bourgeoisie is also willing to participate in the united front against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. The situation in North Korea and Vietnam is roughly similar. Eastern Europe has a different situation. The People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe, namely Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania, have relatively developed industries, while the bourgeoisie stood on the side of German-Italian fascism and Anglo-American imperialism, opposing the People's Democratic Revolution. Therefore, in these countries, the People's Democratic Dictatorship is a form of the Proletarian Dictatorship. After the anti-fascist war and with the assistance of the Soviet Union, the proletariat in these countries overthrew the reactionary rule of the bourgeoisie and are gradually eliminating capitalist economy and entering socialism. This article explains the content of the People's Democratic System in Eastern Europe.

What is the class content of a People's Democratic state?

The Romanian Workers' Party, when establishing the People's Democratic System, was guided, like other New Democratic countries, by the theories of Lenin, namely: that during the transition from capitalism to socialism, no matter how different the forms may be, the essence of these forms must be the same - the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The characteristics of the historical development of each country and its national characteristics are also the reasons for the somewhat different forms in the progress of each country towards socialism. However, overemphasizing the importance of the characteristics of individual countries represents an opportunistic and nationalistic tendency, which in essence will lead to abandoning Marxism-Leninism and its basic content - the dictatorship of the proletariat.

People's democracy is a form of the dictatorship of the proletariat. However, the working class of the People's Democratic countries in alliance with the laboring peasants was able to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat without civil war, which is what differentiates it from the Soviet revolution. The People's Democratic countries were able to do so because the Soviet Union won a historic victory in World War II, and because the armed forces of the socialist countries heroically carried out their international duty to the laboring people, liberating these countries.

The rapid growth of Soviet state power brought about a change in the balance of power between capitalism and socialism in the international situation in favor of socialism. The Soviet Union's great victory in World War II and its political and economic assistance to the liberated countries enabled these countries to move forward along the path of people's democracy. All attempts by the imperialists to restore the capitalist system in the People's Democratic countries have been shattered by the people's determination to defend their freedom and independence - their freedom and independence are built on the foundation of brotherly alliance and consolidated friendship with the invincible Soviet state. Because the People's Democratic countries have the support of the Soviet Union, the imperialists have not been able to carry out naked armed intervention against them, as they did against the young Soviet state from 1918 to 1920.

Therefore, today, there are two different forms of the dictatorship of the proletariat: the Soviet form and the People's Democratic form. The Soviet form is a higher form of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The political foundation of the People's Democratic System and the political foundation of the Soviet System are built on different conditions. The Great October Socialist Revolution completely smashed the old state machine and handed over power to the Soviets, thus creating a higher form of socialist state - the Soviet state.

The historical characteristics of the development of the Romanian revolution, like those of other People's Democratic countries, are that the old state machine was not immediately smashed.

Due to the special conditions of its beginning and subsequent development, the People's Democratic country represents a new regime in which components of the old bourgeois state machine continue to exist for a certain period.

Taking Romania as an example, after liberation, the proletariat waged a fierce struggle to win positions in state institutions, because the bourgeoisie and landlords knew that losing these positions would mean their own defeat and destruction.

However, a thorough reorganization of the state machine was only possible after a long struggle. After the workers consolidated their positions, they drove the fascists and reactionaries out of state institutions. The class content of state institutions gradually changed as large numbers of workers were absorbed. This process was greatly accelerated after the working class, in alliance with the laboring peasants, abolished autocracy and completely seized power. The old army, the old judiciary, and the organs of suppression - the police and the gendarmerie - were all abolished and replaced by new people's organs.

But only the establishment of People's Representative Conferences - local organs of power built on a broad democratic foundation - could create new state institutions that, from top to bottom, in all aspects, conformed to the purposes and tasks of the new state and were adapted to the task of building socialism.

The Soviet of Workers' Representatives is the political foundation of the Soviet Union. The new organs of power - the People's Representative Conferences - are the political foundation of the People's Democratic countries. The establishment of People's Representative Conferences marks the fact that the People's Democracy is approaching the higher form of the dictatorship of the proletariat - the Soviet form - in form. This type of organ of power already exists in Bulgaria and is being established in other People's Democratic countries.

People's Representative Conferences in Romania

The People's Representative Conference represents an unprecedentedly democratic form of government in the history of the Romanian people. It constitutes the political foundation of the People's Democracy - a democracy that serves the vast majority of the people against the minority of oppressors.

The People's Representative Conference must maintain close ties with the masses in order to influence millions of working people and mobilize them to fight for the construction of socialism. Before the election of the People's Representative Conference, the provisional committees at all levels (regions, cities, villages, etc.) that temporarily perform the functions of the Representative Conference are fulfilling these necessary tasks. The Provisional Committee exercises power and is responsible for local economic, social, and cultural activities.

As the sole organ of power in the locality, the People's Representative Conference carries out all its activities in accordance with the principle of democratic centralism, ensuring the strict implementation of the instructions and plans of the central organs of power. At the same time, the Representative Conference must encourage initiative at the lower levels, consider all local specificities and needs, develop the economy, and encourage the people to work hard to build.

The nature of Romania's old organs of power can illustrate the great revolutionary significance of the transition from the old organs of power to the People's Representative Conference.

The old regime in Romania, like all bourgeois states, was divided into legislative and administrative organs. State power was actually in the hands of the administrative organs. The legislative organ - the parliament - had little influence on national life. Local power was concentrated in the hands of officials appointed by the government or the Council of Ministers. County heads and mayors were officials who ruled the people without being accountable to the people. They were only controlled by the central government. The whole apparatus was the best example of bureaucratic government. Peasants had to travel all the way to Bucharest to resolve general issues such as schools and water supply. Letters sent from villages to government departments were lost; even if there was a reply, it would be half a year or more later.

Agricultural, financial, health, and other organs at the district level were not under the jurisdiction of the county head or mayor. Anyone could arbitrarily order the people around, but no one was accountable to the people, and no one represented the people's opinions.

This is a typical example of bourgeois parliamentarianism and bourgeois democracy in all European capitalist countries.

The People's Representative Conference - the political foundation of the People's Democracy - is, in contrast to the anti-people, anti-democratic system, the highest organ of local power (regions, districts, cities, and villages) elected by the people, accountable to the people, controlled by the people, and, if necessary, recallable by the people.

The People's Representative Conference in the New Democratic countries is a new form of political organization led by the working class.

The People's Representative Conference is an organ of the dictatorship of the proletariat. It embodies the organization of all working people, regardless of nationality, race, education, etc.

The People's Representative Conference consistently solves national problems in the spirit of socialism. Another advantage of the People's Representative Conference as an organ of power is that its activities can be combined with the activities of mass organizations - trade unions, cooperatives, youth leagues, etc.

The People's Representative Conference is the most democratic organ of power in these countries. It is also the only organ that can establish the alliance between the working class and all working people, maintain and strengthen the leading role of the proletariat.

The People's Representative Conference is not a specialized deliberative organ of the bourgeois parliamentary type. It is the people's true power, solving political, economic, cultural, and other problems related to the vital interests of the working people every day.

The Romanian Workers' Party regards the development and consolidation of the People's Representative Conference as a top priority, because the establishment of the People's Representative Conference means that it is becoming the real, only, and most important political foundation of the People's Democratic country - which is realizing the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The People's Representative Conference is different from the old administrative system. Its work is built on the vast masses of people who are absorbed into local and state power.

One of the important ways to organize the masses around the provisional committee is through the various committees and civil affairs committees that are currently temporarily performing the functions of the People's Representative Conference. Workers, laboring peasants, housewives, young people, and progressive intellectuals are all absorbed into the work of the provisional committee.

In this way, the People's Representative Conference absorbs countless activists who strengthen the ties between the People's Congress and the masses and absorb the masses into the work of state power. (To be continued)
