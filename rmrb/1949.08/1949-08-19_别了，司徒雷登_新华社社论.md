Farewell, Leighton Stuart

The United States' White Paper was released on August 5th, at a time when Leighton Stuart had already left Nanjing and was on his way to Washington, but had not yet arrived. This is understandable, because he is a symbol of the complete failure of the American policy of aggression. Leighton Stuart was an American born in China, with extensive social connections in China. He ran a church school in China for many years, and was imprisoned by the Japanese during the Anti-Japanese War. He usually pretended to love both America and China, and was quite able to deceive a section of the Chinese people. Therefore, he was favored by Marshall and became the ambassador to China, becoming one of the leading figures in the Marshall system. In the view of the Marshall system, he had only one shortcoming, namely, that throughout his tenure in China representing the policies of the Marshall system, it was precisely this policy that was completely defeated by the Chinese people, and this was no small responsibility. The White Paper, aimed at shirking responsibility, should of course be published at a time when Leighton Stuart was about to arrive but had not yet arrived.

The war in which the United States provided money and guns, and Chiang Kai-shek provided men, to fight for the United States and kill Chinese people, in order to turn China into an American colony, constituted a major part of the American imperialist policy of aggression in the world after World War II. The targets of American aggression policy had several parts. The European part, the Asian part, and the American part, these three were the main parts. China is the center of Asia, a large country with 475 million people. If it seized China, the whole of Asia would be its. With the Asian front of American imperialism consolidated, it could concentrate its forces to attack Europe and defeat Europe. American imperialism considered its front in the Americas to be relatively solid. This was the entire wishful thinking of the American aggression plan.

However, firstly, the American and the world's people did not want war; secondly, the awakening of the European people, the rise of the new democratic countries in Eastern Europe, and especially the unprecedentedly powerful peace fortress of the Soviet Union standing between Europe and Asia, stubbornly resisting American aggression policy, diverted most of America's attention; thirdly, and this is the main point, the awakening of the Chinese people, the armed forces led by the Chinese Communist Party, and the strength of the people's organizations had become unprecedentedly strong. Thus, the ruling clique of American imperialism was forced to refrain from adopting a policy of large-scale direct armed invasion of China, and instead adopted a policy of helping Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war.

The American navy, army, and air force had already participated in the war in China. Qingdao, Shanghai, and Taiwan were American naval bases. American troops had been stationed in Beiping, Tianjin, Tangshan, Qinhuangdao, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Nanjing. The American air force controlled the whole of China and took military maps of all the strategic locations in China from the air. In Anping Town near Beiping, in Jiutai near Changchun, in Tangshan, and in the Jiaodong Peninsula, American troops or military personnel had been in contact with the People's Liberation Army, and had been captured by the People's Liberation Army many times. Chennault's Flying Tigers had participated extensively in the war. The American air force not only transported troops for Chiang Kai-shek, but also bombed and sank the revolting cruiser Chongqing. All these were direct acts of participation in the war, but the scale was not very large, and the main form of aggression was to provide large-scale funding, guns, and advisors to help Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war.

The reason why the United States adopted this method was determined by the objective situation in China and the world, and it was not that the ruling faction of American imperialism -- Truman, the Marshall system -- did not want to directly occupy China. At the beginning of aiding Chiang in the war, it also staged a civilized drama of the United States mediating the dispute between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, attempting to soften the Chinese Communist Party and deceive the Chinese people, and control the whole of China without a fight. The peace talks failed, the deception didn't work, and the war began.

To those forgetful liberals or "democratic individualists" who harbor illusions about the United States, please look at Acheson's words: "When peace comes, the United States faces the following three possible choices regarding China: (1) to completely disengage from all involvement; (2) to intervene militarily on a large scale, helping the Nationalist Party to destroy the Communist Party; (3) to help the Nationalist Party establish its sovereignty in China as widely as possible, while encouraging both sides to engage in consultations, and striving to avoid the outbreak of civil war."

Why not adopt the first policy? Acheson said: "The first path, I believe, as American public opinion felt at that time, was tantamount to abandoning our international responsibilities and traditional friendly policies towards China before engaging in helpful and firm efforts in the United States." It turns out that America's so-called "international responsibility and friendly policy towards China" is to interfere in China. Interference is called assuming international responsibility, interference is called a friendly policy towards China, and non-interference is not acceptable. Acheson here raped American public opinion; this is the "public opinion" of Wall Street, not the public opinion of the American people.

Why not adopt the second policy? Acheson said: "The second path, in theory, may be appealing, and in retrospect, it may be so. But it cannot be implemented. In the decade before the war, the Nationalist Party did not have the ability to destroy the Communist Party. After the war, as mentioned earlier, the strength of the Nationalist Party had been weakened, its will was depressed, and it had lost the support of the people. The behavior of the Nationalist Party's civil and military officials in the recovered areas had caused the Nationalist Party to quickly lose the support and prestige of the people in these areas. On the other hand, the strength of the Communist Party was stronger than it had been in the past, and it already controlled most of North China. Due to the ineffectiveness of the Nationalist Party's army, which was later tragically demonstrated, perhaps only the military power of the United States could drive away the Communist Party. The American people would obviously not agree to let our troops assume such a huge obligation in 1945 or later. We therefore adopted the third path."

A good method: the United States provides money and guns, Chiang Kai-shek provides people, to fight for the United States and kill Chinese people, "destroying the Communist Party," turning China into an American colony, fulfilling America's "international responsibility," and realizing the "traditional friendly policy towards China."

The Kuomintang is corrupt and incompetent, "its will is depressed, and it has lost the support of the people," but it still has to be given money and guns to fight. Direct military intervention is appropriate "in theory" and "may be appealing," but in fact it is not feasible, and "the American people would obviously not agree." It is not that we -- Truman, Marshall, and other members of the imperialist system -- are unwilling to interfere; we very much want to interfere, but because the situation in China, the situation in the United States, and the entire international situation (which Acheson did not mention) do not permit it, we had to seek the next best thing and adopt the third path.

Those Chinese who think "victory is possible without international aid," listen up, Acheson is giving you a lesson. Acheson is a good teacher who gives free lessons without pay; he has revealed the whole truth so tirelessly and without concealment. The reason why the United States did not send a large number of troops to attack China is not because the American government was unwilling, but because the American government had concerns. The first concern was that the Chinese people opposed it, and it feared being trapped in a quagmire from which it could not extricate itself. The second concern was that the American people opposed it, so it did not dare to issue a mobilization order. The third concern was that the Soviet Union and the people of Europe and other countries opposed it, and it would risk incurring the disapproval of the whole world. Acheson's lovable frankness is limited; he is unwilling to mention this third concern. This is because he is afraid of losing face in front of the Soviet Union, and he is afraid that the European Marshall Plan, which has already failed but still pretends not to have failed, will fall into a complete collapse.

Those short-sighted, muddle-headed liberal or democratic individualist Chinese people, listen up, Acheson is giving you a lesson; Acheson is your good teacher; the American benevolence, righteousness, and morality that you have imagined have been swept away by Acheson. Isn't that so? Can you find a trace of benevolence, righteousness, or morality in the White Paper?

The United States does have science and technology, but unfortunately it is in the hands of capitalists, not in the hands of the people. Its use is to exploit and oppress domestically, and to invade and kill abroad. The United States also has "democratic politics," but unfortunately it is just another name for the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. The United States has a lot of money, but it is only willing to give it to the extremely corrupt Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. Now and in the future, it is said to be very willing to give some to its fifth column in China, but it is unwilling to give it to the general bookish, ungrateful liberals or democratic individualists, and even less willing to give it to the Communist Party. Giving is possible, but there are conditions. What are the conditions? It is to follow me. Americans in Beiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai have scattered some relief flour to see who is willing to stoop down and pick it up. Tai Gong fishes, and those who are willing take the bait. Food that comes with a sneer will cause a stomach ache if eaten.

We Chinese people have backbone. Many people who were once liberals or democratic individualists have stood up in the face of American imperialists and their running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries. Wen Yiduo slammed the table and stood up, glaring angrily at the Kuomintang's guns, preferring to fall down rather than submit. Zhu Ziqing, suffering from a serious illness, preferred to starve to death rather than receive American relief food. Han Yu of the Tang Dynasty wrote "Ode to Boyi," praising Boyi, who was irresponsible to his own people, deserted and ran away, and opposed King Wu's leadership of the people's liberation war at that time, and had some "democratic individualist" ideas; that was a wrong praise. We should write an ode to Wen Yiduo, an ode to Zhu Ziqing; they showed the heroic spirit of our nation.

What is there to fear from a little bit of difficulty? Let them blockade us! If they blockade us for ten or eight years, all of China's problems will be solved. The Chinese people are not afraid of death, so are they still afraid of difficulties? Lao Tzu said: "The people are not afraid of death, why threaten them with it?" American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, not only "threatened us with death," but also actually made us die. In addition to Wen Yiduo and others, they have killed millions of Chinese people in the past three years with American carbines, machine guns, 60mm mortars, 82mm mortars, rocket launchers, 155mm howitzers, and airplane bombs. Now this situation is coming to an end. They have been defeated. It is not that they are killing us, but that we are killing them. They are about to be finished. The little bit of difficulty, blockade, unemployment, famine, inflation, rising prices, etc. that they leave us are indeed difficulties, but they are a relief compared to the past three years. We have overcome the hurdle of the past three years. Can't we overcome these current difficulties? Can't we survive without America?

The People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River, and the American colonial government in Nanjing scattered like startled birds and beasts. But Ambassador Leighton Stuart sat still, watching with wide eyes, hoping to open a new shop and make a fortune. What did Leighton Stuart see? In addition to seeing the People's Liberation Army marching past in one team after another, and workers, peasants, and students rising up in groups, he also saw a phenomenon, namely that the Chinese liberals or democratic individualists were also chanting slogans and talking about revolution in large numbers along with the workers, peasants, soldiers, and students. In short, no one paid attention to him, making him "alone and isolated," with nothing to do, so he had to pick up his briefcase and leave.

There is still a section of intellectuals and other people in China who have confused ideas and harbor illusions about the United States. Therefore, efforts should be made to persuade, win over, educate, and unite them in good faith, so that they will stand on the side of the people and not be fooled by imperialism. But the prestige of the entire American imperialism among the Chinese people has been bankrupt, and the American White Paper is a record of bankruptcy. Advanced people should make good use of the White Paper to educate the Chinese people.

Leighton Stuart has left, and the White Paper has arrived. Very good, very good. Both of these things are worth celebrating.

### 别了，司徒雷登  新华社社论

专栏：

　　别了，司徒雷登
    新华社社论
    美国的白皮书选择在司徒雷登业已离开南京快到华盛顿但是尚未到达的日子——八月五日发表，是可以理解的，因为他是美国侵略政策彻底失败的象征。司徒雷登是一个在中国出生的美国人，在中国有广泛的社会联系，在中国办过多年的教会学校，在抗日时期坐过日本的监狱，平素装着爱美国也爱中国，颇能迷惑一部分中国人，因此被马歇尔看中，做了驻华大使，成为马歇尔系统中的风云人物之一。在马歇尔系统看来，他只有一个缺点，就是在他代表马歇尔系统的政策驻在中国的整个时期，恰恰就是这个政策彻底地被中国人民打败了的时期，这个责任可不小。以脱卸责任为目的的白皮书，当然应该在司徒雷登将到未到的日子发表为适宜。
    美国出钱出枪，蒋介石出人，替美国打仗杀中国人，借以变中国为美国殖民地的战争，组成了美国帝国主义在第二次世界大战以后的世界侵略政策的一个重大的部分。美国侵略政策的对象有好几个部分。欧洲部分，亚洲部分，美洲部分，这三个是主要的部分。中国是亚洲的重心，一个具有四万万七千五百万人口的大国，夺取了中国，整个亚洲都是它的了。美帝国主义的亚洲战线巩固了，它就可以集中力量向欧洲进攻，击溃欧洲。美帝国主义在美洲的战线，它是认为比较地巩固的。这就是美国侵略计划的整个如意算盘。
    可是，一则美国和全世界人民都不要战争；二则欧洲人民的觉悟，东欧各新民主国家的兴起，特别是苏联这个空前强大的和平堡垒耸立在欧亚两洲之间，顽强地抵抗着美国的侵略政策，使美国的注意力大部分被吸引住了；三则，这是主要的，中国人民的觉悟，中国共产党领导的武装力量和民众组织力量已经空前强大起来了；这样就迫使美帝国主义的当权集团不能采取大规模直接武装进攻中国的政策，而采取了帮助蒋介石打内战的政策。
    美国的海陆空军已经在中国参加了战争。青岛、上海和台湾，是美国的海军基地。北平、天津、唐山、秦皇岛、青岛、上海、南京都驻过美国军队。美国的空军控制了全中国，并从空中拍摄了全中国战略要地的军用地图。在北平附近的安平镇，在长春附近的九台，在唐山，在胶东半岛，美国的军队或军事人员曾经和人民解放军接触过，被人民解放军俘虏过多次。陈纳德航空队曾经广泛地参战。美国空军除替蒋介石运兵外，又炸沉了起义的重庆号巡洋舰。所有这些，都是直接参战的行动，只是规模还不算很大，而以大规模地出钱出枪出顾问人员帮助蒋介石打内战为主要的侵略方式。
    美国之所以采取这种方式，是被中国和全世界的客观形势所决定的，并不是美帝国主义的当权派——杜鲁门、马歇尔系统不想直接占领中国。在助蒋作战的开头，又曾演过一出美国出面调处国共两党争端的文明戏，企图软化中国共产党和欺骗中国人民，不战而控制全中国。和谈失败了，欺骗不行了，战争揭幕了。
    对于美国怀着幻想的善忘的自由主义者或“民主个人主义”者们，请你们看看艾奇逊的话：“和平来临时，美国面临下列对华的可能的三种抉择：（一）完全摆脱一切牵连；（二）大规模地在军事方面加以干涉，援助国民党击毁共产党；（三）一方面援助国民党尽可能广大地在中国确立其主权，一方面鼓励双方从事协商，尽力避免内战的发生。”
    为什么不采取第一个政策呢？艾奇逊说：“第一途，我相信，那时美国的民意也如此感到，无异在美国从事有助的坚定的努力以前，放弃了我们的国际责任及对华传统的友好政策”。原来美国的所谓“国际责任和对华友好政策”，就是干涉中国。干涉就叫做担负国际责任，干涉就叫做对华友好政策，不干涉是不行的。艾奇逊在这里强奸了美国的民意，这是华尔街的“民意”，不是美国的民意。
    为什么不采取第二个政策呢？艾奇逊说：“第二途，在理论上可能吸人心目，回顾之下，也可能如此。但是不能实行的。大战前的十年当中，国民党没有能力摧毁共产党。大战后，如前所述，国民党的力量业已削弱，意志消沉，且不得民心。国民党的文武官员在收复区中的举止，已使国民党迅速地在这些区域中丧失了人民的支持和声望。在他方面，共产党的力量则较它过去更为强大，且已控有华北的大部分。由于国民党军队的无效能，这点后来可悲地表现出来，也许只有靠美国的军力才可以逐走共产党。美国人民显然不会答应在一九四五年或以后让我们的军队担负如此巨大的义务的。我们因此采取了第三途。”
    好办法，美国出钱出枪，蒋介石出人，替美国打仗杀中国人，“击毁共产党”，变中国为美国殖民地，完成美国的“国际责任”，实现“传统的对华友好政策”。
    国民党腐败无能，“意志消沉，且不得民心”，还是要出钱出枪叫它打仗。真接出兵干涉，在“理论上”是妥当的，“可能吸人心目”，在事实上是不行的，“美国人民显然不会答应”。不是我们——杜鲁门、马歇尔等人的帝国主义系统——不愿干，干是很想的，只是因为中国形势，美国形势，还有整个国际形势（这点艾奇逊没有说）不许可，不得已而求其次，采取了第三条路。
    那些认为“不要国际援助也可以胜利）的中国人听着，艾奇逊在给你们上课了。艾奇逊是不拿薪水上义务课的好教员，他是如此诲人不倦地毫无隐晦地说出了全篇的真理。美国之所以没有大量出兵进攻中国，不是因为美国政府不愿意，而是因为美国政府有顾虑。第一顾虑中国人民反对它，它怕陷在泥潭里拔不出去。第二顾虑美国人民反对它，因此不敢下动员令。第三顾虑苏联及欧洲人民及各国人民反对它，它将冒天下之大不韪。艾奇逊的可爱的坦白性是有限度的，这第三个顾虑他不愿意说。这是因为他怕在苏联面前丢脸，他怕已经失败了但是还要装做好似没有失败的样子的欧洲马歇尔计划陷入全般崩溃的惨境。
    那些近视的思想糊涂的自由主义或民主个人主义的中国人听着，艾奇逊在给你们上课了，艾奇逊是你们的好教员，你们所设想的美国的仁义道德已被艾奇逊一扫而空。不是吗，你们能在白皮书中找到一丝一毫的仁义道德吗？
    美国确实有科学，有技术，可惜抓在资本家手里，不抓在人民手里，其用处就是对内剥削和压迫，对外侵略和杀人。美国也有“民主政治”，可惜只是资产阶级一个阶级的独裁统治的别名。美国有很多钱，可惜只愿意送给极端腐败的蒋介石反动派。现在和将来据说很愿意送些给它在中国的第五纵队，但是不愿意送给一般的书生气十足的不识抬举的自由主义者，或民主个人主义者，更加不愿意送给共产党。送是可以的，要有条件。什么条件呢？就是跟我走。美国人在北平，在天津，在上海，都洒了些救济粉，看一看什么人愿意弯腰拾起来。太公钓鱼，愿者上钓，嗟来之食，吃下去肚子要痛的。
    我们中国人是有骨气的，许多曾经是自由主义或民主个人主义的人们，在美国帝国主义者及其走狗国民党反动派面前站起来了。闻一多拍案而起，横眉怒对国民党的手枪，宁可倒下去，不愿屈服。朱自清一身重病，宁可饿死，不领美国的救济粮。唐朝的韩愈写过“伯夷颂”，颂的是一个对自己国家的人民不负责任，开小差逃跑，又反对武王领导的当时的人民解放战争，颇有些“民主个人主义”思想的伯夷，那是颂错了。我们应当写闻一多颂，写朱自清颂，他们表现了我们民族的英雄气概。
    多少一点困难怕什么。封锁罢，封锁十年八年，中国的一切问题都解决了。中国人死都不怕，还怕困难么？老子说过：“民不畏死，奈何以死惧之”。美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石反动派，对于我们不但“以死惧之”，而且实行叫我们死，闻一多等人之外，还在过去三年中用美国的卡宾枪，机关枪，六○炮，八二迫击炮，火箭炮，十五榴弹炮和飞机炸弹，杀死了数百万中国人。现在这种情况已近尾声了，他们打了败仗了，不是他们杀过来而是我们杀过去了，他们快要完蛋了。留给我们多少一点困难、封锁、失业、灾荒、通货膨胀、物价上升之类，确实是困难，但是比起过去三年来已经松了一口气了。过去三年的一关也闯过了，难道不能克服现在这点困难么？没有美国就不能活命么？
    人民解放军横渡长江，南京的美国殖民政府如乌兽散，司徒雷登大使老爷却坐着不动，睁起眼睛看着，希望开设新店，捞一把。司徒雷登看见了什么呢？除了看见人民解放军一队一队地走过，工人，农民，学生一群一群地起来之外，他还看见了一种现象，就是中国的自由主义者或民主个人主义者们也大群地和工农兵学生等人一道唤口号，讲革命。总之是没有人去理他，使得他“茕茕孑立，形影相吊”，没有什么事做了，只好挟起皮包走路。
    中国还有一部分知识分子及其他人等存有糊涂思想，对美国存有幻想，因此应当努力地善意地对他们进行说服争取，教育和团结的工作，使他们站到人民方面来，不上帝国主义的当。但是整个美帝国主义在中国人民中的威信已经破产了，美国的白皮书，就是一部破产的纪录。先进的人们，应当很好地利用白皮书对中国人民进行教育工作。
    司徒雷登走了，白皮书来了，很好，很好，这两件事都是值得庆祝的。
