　　Several Problems in Agricultural Production Leadership in Anguo County
　　Our Newspaper's Hebei Rural Investigation Team
    During this trip to central Hebei, our reporter spent about a month deeply investigating several types of villages in Anguo to examine several problems in agricultural production leadership. The problems currently existing in Anguo's production leadership are more or less present in other areas as well. Therefore, we have compiled these materials for your reference.
　　I. What Role Did the Branch Play?
    This time we investigated villages such as Dazhang, Sixia, Nanloudi, and Zhuotou, which proves that the core role of the branch is the key to doing a good job in agricultural production. Party work in these areas has a relatively solid foundation, and the mainstays of village-level cadres mostly have ten years of struggle history; the masses have also gone through the great struggles of the War of Resistance Against Japan, rent and interest reduction, equal distribution of land, and democratic party consolidation, and their political awareness is relatively high. After the issuance of land certificates and the determination of land rights, production enthusiasm inside and outside the Party is very high, which is a good condition for this year's production.
    However, these branches currently have many problems, and generally do not play a role in production movements, with only a small number being good.
    For example, in Yucun and Yancun in the Fifth District, due to the strong work of the Party branch, strict various systems, tight ideological education of party members, and timely criticism and self-criticism, party members are enthusiastic and the whole village work is very active, the mutual aid organizations are also sound, and various tasks are completed well through the efforts of all party members and the masses. When deploying each task in Yancun, the branch committee first discusses and makes a resolution. Then each member (government member, youth member, etc.) goes back to convene a working meeting of his department, puts forward the branch resolution at the working meeting of each department for discussion, and discusses specific implementation methods, and convenes villagers and production team meetings by sub-area. The branch calls on its party members to actively publicize and educate the masses in various tasks, lead the masses with their exemplary actions, and ensure the realization of the plan. At the same time, they contact older farmers with prestige among the masses to understand the opinions and requirements of the masses. In this way, the branch truly plays the role of a core fortress in production leadership. However, the branches of most villages are lax and do not play a role. Party meetings are not held for a long time, and many party members often do not attend party meetings. For example, at each Party meeting in Zhuotou Village, less than half of the Party members attend. These branches rarely educate party members, and the ideology of party members is generally very chaotic. Also, because the problems left over from the past "moving stones" have not been completely resolved, there is still disunity between new and old cadres. In production work, the general phenomenon is no organization and no leadership. Branch cadres almost never do branch work, and branch members also lack specific division of labor. Most party members and cadres are indifferent to work, and even individual party members' thinking is gradually degenerating and their work is passive. The ideological weapon of criticism and self-criticism within the Party has been abandoned for a long time.
    In this way, the Party's leadership over agricultural production is weak and powerless, laissez-faire, and unable to play its due role. This is an important problem in the current rural production leadership.
　　II. Organization and Leadership of Mutual Aid Teams
    There are many problems in mutual aid this year, and leadership is the basic one. In the four villages in the First District, there used to be mutual aid teams, but now the mutual aid teams in two villages have collapsed; in Changzhuang, out of 561 households in the entire village, only three households are still in mutual aid; the masses in Liwangzhuang are in great need of production mutual aid, and they need to hoe cotton seedlings after rain, but no one leads the organization. They said: "It's busy after the rain, and you can't take care of everything. We want to help each other, but no one is in charge!" This also shows that the masses require mutual aid.
    Dazhang Village used to have many types of mutual aid teams, but due to the formalism of leadership in the past, rigidly transporting experiences from other villages, forcing the masses to calculate work and clear work, and stipulating various meeting reporting systems, it was enforced. Especially during the busy farming season, mutual aid team meetings were constantly held, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Also, when reviewing and mobilizing to speak out bitterness, it was said that those who did not participate in the mutual aid team were "exploiting", and the mutual aid teams quickly collapsed from 37 teams to 11 teams. After last year's wheat harvest, the cadres reviewed the past mistakes of forcing the organization of mutual aid, explained the principle of equivalent voluntary mutual aid, and that mutual aid between those with and without labor is not exploitation as long as it is equivalent exchange, and the mutual aid teams gradually recovered. There are currently 29 teams in the village, of which 11 teams are in regular mutual aid, achieving a combination of agriculture and sideline occupations. 110 households in the entire village participated in the mutual aid organization, mostly in the nature of partnering and temporary mutual aid during the busy farming season. The formation of teams is completely free, without paying wages or calculating work, but it can achieve mutual non-loss.
    The current problems in mutual aid: (1) Because mutual aid is work for work, with similar temperaments, without calculating work or paying wages, it is mostly mutual aid between households with equal labor. At the same time, this kind of mutual aid lacks necessary organizational leadership, and many problems will gradually accumulate over time. Attention should be paid to gradually strengthening leadership and helping them solve problems; (2) Temporary mutual aid is more common during the busy farming season, and the teams disband at other times, so they cannot save more labor and animal power to engage in sideline occupations, and labor cannot be highly utilized; (3) How party members in the branch should play a role in mutual aid is still a problem that needs to be solved. Party members leading mutual aid teams should emphasize leading production with production, rather than standing outside of production, so that the interests of party members and the interests of the masses are consistent, and the mutual aid teams can develop and consolidate. Currently, many branch party members have not learned the methods of production leadership.
　　III. Substitute Farming and Women's Production
    The issue of substitute farming is currently being done relatively well in various villages. Generally, villages have adopted the method of fixed substitute farming: the substitute farming household and the family members of the military first sign a contract, such as the same soil quality and fertilizer. If the grain yield is less than other similar land, the substitute farming household is responsible for compensation, and if the yield is higher, it is distributed according to the 30-70 split (30% for the military family and 70% for the substitute farming household). For example, in Nanloudi Village, there are 83 households of martyrs, military dependents, and workers, with 26 households engaged in fixed farming. This substitute farming method was implemented in many places last year and achieved results. As for military dependents with or without sufficient labor, short-term workers are allocated on a temporary basis to provide appropriate care. For example, in Sixia Village, there are 97 households of martyrs, military dependents, and workers, with 13 households engaged in fixed farming, and the rest are helped with several short-term workers during the busy farming season. The leadership has educated both the military dependents and the masses: on the one hand, it is necessary to ensure that the land of the military dependents is well planted, and on the other hand, it is necessary to avoid burdening the masses as much as possible, so the military dependents generally have a high degree of awareness.
    Anguo's substitute farming method is basically good. The current problem is how to make it more reasonable and fair, and help military dependents solve the difficulty of insufficient manure, such as mobilizing women and primary school students to help military dependents cut grass for composting and press green manure.
    Women's production is generally very poor. Only during the wheat and autumn harvest are they more commonly able to participate in field production, and there is very little organized participation at other times. In Nanloudi Village, in addition to women from military dependents who lack labor and still participate in field production, women generally do not participate. Sideline production such as weaving has also largely stopped. Currently, all villages feel a lack of labor, but how to mobilize women, who account for more than half of the population, to participate in production has not been sufficiently valued by leaders at all levels, which is also a problem in local production.
　　IV. Leadership Style
    This year, production in various villages generally lacks leadership. The county party committee is satisfied with general instructions; the district level also does not concretize these instructions according to the different situations of different villages, but rather performs official duties, passing instructions up and down; village work is pushed and moved.
    Dong Liwangzhuang in the Seventh District is the village that implements work best, but the village cadres only broadcast the production decisions and plans on the roof and that was it. Many villages in other districts did not even do such simple broadcasting, let alone research and deployment. Some village cadres believe that leading production delays their own work, some believe that production does not need leadership, and some are troubled by the inability to lead. The county and district have failed to solve these problems in a timely manner, so production work in many villages has fallen into laissez-faire.
    Another problem in leadership is that "shock" methods are more common than regular leadership. Insufficient mobilization and persuasion during sowing, and the use of top-down administrative orders and "shock" methods. When the task is urgent, the branch calls on party members to "take the lead," and individual villages even pulled out green seedlings to plant cotton. Once the "shock" is over, it flows down on its own. Work is hot for a while and cold for a while, and the masses are loose for a while and tight for a while. Therefore, in improving leadership, the county and district must consider how to establish regular leadership work, go deep into the masses to understand the situation, and combine regular work with shock work to more concretely help village-level leadership and solve specific difficulties, which is the central problem of current production leadership.

　　安国县农业生产领导中的几个问题
    本报河北农村考察组
    记者此次在冀中采访中，曾以一月左右时间，深入安国几种类型村，考察农业生产领导中的若干问题。安国目前生产领导上所存在的问题，其他地区也或多或少的存在着。因此，特将材料整理写出，以供各地参考。
　　一、支部起了什么作用
    这次我们调查了大章、寺下、南楼底、镯头等村，证明支部的核心作用，乃是作好农业生产工作的关键。这些地区党的工作较有基础，村级干部中，主要骨干多是有着十来年的斗争历史；群众也经过了抗日战争、减租减息、土地平分、民主整党的伟大斗争，政治觉悟较高。发土地证、确定地权之后，党内外生产情绪都很高涨，这是今年生产的良好条件。
    但这些支部当前却存在不少问题，在生产运动中普遍不起作用，好的只是很少数。
    如五区的淤村、阎村，由于党的支部工作坚强，各种制度严格，党员思想教育抓的紧，批评与自我批评及时，因而党员情绪饱满，全村工作就很活跃，互助组织也很健全，各种工作在全体党员和群众的努力下，完成的都较好。阎村在布置每次工作时，支委会首先讨论，作出决议。然后各委员（政府委员、青年委员等）即回去召开本部门的工作会议，将支部决议在各部门的工作会议上提出讨论，并讨论出具体执行的办法，分片召开村民及生产小组会议。支部则号召自己的党员，在各种工作中积极宣传与教育群众，以自己的模范行动，带领群众，保证计划的实现。同时联系群众中有威信的老农，了解群众的意见和要求。这样支部对生产领导上，就真正发挥了核心堡垒作用。但大多数村的支部是松懈不起作用的，党的会议长期不开，不少党员经常不参加党的会议。如镯头村每次党的会议，到会的党员不足半数。这些支部对党员很少教育，党员思想一般是很紊乱的。又由于过去“搬石头”中所遗留下来的问题未彻底解决，以致新老干部之间尚存在不团结的现象。在生产工作上，普遍现象是无组织、无领导。支干几乎全部不作支部工作，支委也缺乏具体分工，大部分党员和干部对工作漠不关心，甚至个别的党员的思想在逐渐蜕化，工作消极。党内批评与自我批评的思想武器，已被长期抛弃不用。
    这样党对农业生产的领导，就表现出软弱无力，放任自流，起不到应有的作用。这是当前农村生产领导上的重要问题。
　　二、互助组的组织领导
    今年互助中存在不少问题，而领导问题则是基本的。在一区的四个村中，过去都有过互助组，现在两个村的互助组已经垮台；常庄全村五六一户中，目前仅有三户还在互助；李王庄群众很需要生产互助，雨后需要赶锄棉苗，但没人领导组织。他们说：“雨后忙，顾了这顾不了那，想互助又没有人管！”这也可见群众是要求互助的。
    大章村原来各种类型的互助组很多，但由于过去领导上的形式主义，生硬的搬运外村经验，强迫群众计工、清工，规定各种会议汇报制度，强制执行。特别在农忙时，不断召开互助组会议，引起群众不满。又在复查发动诉苦时，说无劳力参加互助组的就是“剥削”，互助组很快由三十七组垮到十一组。去年麦收后，干部检讨了过去强迫组织互助的错误，说明等价自愿的互助原则，无劳力的和有劳力的互助，只要是等价交换不算剥削，互助组才渐渐恢复。全村现有二十九组，内有十一组是经常互助的，作到了农业和副业的结合。全村有一一○户参加了互助组织，而以农忙时插伙、临时互助的性质为多。结组完全自由，不出工资也不计工，但能达到互不吃亏。
    目前互助中的问题：（一）因互助是工换工，对脾气，不计工，不出工资，因此多是劳力相等的互助，劳力多的户和劳力少的户都没有组织进去。同时这种互助多缺乏必要的组织领导，时间长了就会逐渐积累许多问题，应注意逐渐加强领导，帮助他们解决问题；（二）临时互助在农忙季节的多，平时散伙，故不能更多的节余劳力畜力搞副业，劳力不能高度的发挥；（三）支部党员在互助中，应如何发挥作用，还是个需要解决的问题。党员领导互助组，应强调以生产来领导生产，而不是站在生产之外，这样才能使党员的利益和群众利益一致，互助组就能开展巩固。当前不少支部党员，还没学会生产领导的方法。
　　三、代耕与妇女生产
    代耕问题目前各村是作得比较好的。一般村庄都采用了固定代耕的办法：代耕户与军属先定好合同，如同样的土质、肥料，如比别的同样的土地少打了粮食，则由代耕户包赔，如多打了，按三七批红（军属三代耕户七）。如南楼底村有八十三户烈军工属，固定业耕者二十六户。这种代耕办法去年不少地方实行并有成绩。至于有劳力或劳力不足的军属，按临时照顾办法拨短工，予以适当照顾。如寺下村共有烈军工属九十七户，固定业耕者十三户，其余在农忙时帮助几个短工。领导方面对军干属及群众两方都进行了教育：一方面要保证把军属的地种好，一方面要尽可能不要群众照顾，因此一般军干属的自觉性很高。
    安国的代耕办法基本上是好的，目前问题是如何使他更加合理公平，并帮助军属解决粪料不足的困难，如发动妇女及小学生帮军属割草沤粪、压绿肥等。
    妇女生产问题，一般都很差。只有在麦、秋收割中比较普遍的都能参加田间生产，平时有组织的则很少。南楼底村除劳力缺乏的军属妇女还参加田间生产之外，一般妇女都不参加。副业生产纺织等也大部停顿。目前各村劳动力都感缺乏，但如何发动占人口半数以上的妇女参加生产，各级领导上都未足够重视，这也是当地生产上的一个问题。
　　四、领导作风
    今年各村的生产一般是很缺乏领导的。在县委是满足于一般化的指示；在区一级也不根据不同村庄的不同情况将这些指示具体化，而是例行公事，呈上启下；村的工作是推推动动。
    七区东李王庄是执行工作最好的村，村干部也只是把生产决定与计划在屋顶广播了下就完了，其他区的许多村庄，连这样简单的广播都没有作，更谈不到研究和布置。有些村干部认为领导生产耽误自己的活，有些认为生产勿须领导，有些又苦恼于无法领导。县区未能及时解决这些问题，因而生产工作在不少村庄陷于自流。
    领导上的另一问题是“突击”方式多于经常领导。在播种中动员说服不够，多采用由上而下的行政命令及“突击”方式，在任务紧迫时，支部号召党员“带头”，个别村竟有拔了青苗种棉花的。“突击”一过去，就自流下来。工作是热一阵、冷一阵，群众也是松一阵、紧一阵。因此，在改进领导上，县区必须考虑如何建立经常工作的领导，深入群众了解情况，使经常工作与突击工作结合起来，更具体的帮助村级领导，解决具体困难，乃是当前生产领导的中心问题。
