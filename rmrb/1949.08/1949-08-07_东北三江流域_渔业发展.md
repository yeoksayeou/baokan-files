    Northeast Three Rivers Region
    Fishery Development
    [This newspaper's report] The Nen River and Songhua River waters in Northeast China, known for their fishery products, are expanding their operations with full effort under the leadership of the Heilongjiang Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau. State-owned fishing grounds plan to break through the target of producing 20 million catties of fish this year. Currently, under the unified leadership of the Aquatic Products Bureau, fishermen along the river are actively building embankments (earth dikes), replenishing piles, and manufacturing boats. Some have also formed mutual aid groups or fishermen's groups based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. The Aquatic Products Bureau has built a canning company in Dalair. According to surveys from the puppet Manchukuo era, the Nen River, Songhua River, and Heilongjiang River areas of the province are extremely rich in fishery products, with the Nen River producing the most. The annual output was 34,000 tons, accounting for 62.5% of the total river fishery production in Northeast China. The fishing season is divided into spring, autumn, and winter, producing more than ten kinds of fish, including carp, crucian carp, mandarin fish, whitefish, pike, blackfish, and chum salmon. At present, except for the Heilongjiang River area, where fishery production is yet to be developed due to inconvenient transportation and sparse population, fishermen in the Nen River and Songhua River areas are gradually recovering and developing with the active support and leadership of the former Nen River and Liaobei Fishery Companies. Last year, the state-owned fishing grounds in Dalair and Zhaoyuan alone produced 14 million catties of fish (it is estimated that private and mass fishery activities are about twice the output of state-owned enterprises). In addition to being sold to various parts of Northeast China, some are also transported to the Tianjin and Beijing areas.

    东北三江流域
    渔业发展
    【本报讯】向以渔产著称之东北嫩江及松花江水域，在黑龙江省水产局领导下，全力扩大经营，公营渔场计划在今年突破产鱼二千万斤的计划。现沿江渔民在水产局统一领导下，积极修建墙堑（土堤），补充桩木，制造船只，有的并在自愿两利的原则下组成互助组或渔民小组。水产局已在大赉修建了罐头公司一处。按该省嫩江、松花江、黑龙江三江水域渔产极丰，尤以嫩江出产最多。据伪满时代调查，每年产量为三万四千吨，占全东北江水渔产总量的百分之六十二点五。产渔期分春、秋、冬三季，出产鲤鱼、鲫鱼、鳌花鱼、白鱼、狗鱼、黑鱼、大马哈鱼等十余种。目前除黑龙江水域由于交通不便，人烟稀少，渔产尚待开发外；嫩江、松花江二水域区渔民在原嫩江、辽北两渔业公司积极扶助领导下，已逐渐恢复发展，仅大赉、肇源两公营渔场去年即产鱼一千四百万斤（估计私营和群众性的渔业活动，约倍于公营产量），除向东北各地推销外，并有一部运至平津一带。
