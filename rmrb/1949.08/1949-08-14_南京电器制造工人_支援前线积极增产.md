Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 13th: Nanjing's state-owned electrical equipment manufacturing factories have exceeded their original production targets in the production increase campaign to support the People's Liberation Army's southward advance. The Electric Lighting Factory originally planned to produce 20,000 light bulbs in July, but actually completed more than 24,100. In August, the factory plans to increase temporary workers to complete the task of producing 40,000 light bulbs. The Wired Telecommunications Factory manufactured 570 exchange components in July, exceeding the original plan by 150 units; it also manufactured and assembled ten telephone exchanges (five each of 30-line and 25-line exchanges). The workers of the Wireless Telecommunications Factory also recently completed a rush task. At the end of June, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army ordered 100 transceivers from the factory. At that time, the factory planned to complete them between mid-August and mid-September, but due to urgent needs, the unit requested on July 23rd that the factory complete 17 units before August 3rd. The factory accepted this request and divided all employees into six groups for effective coordination. Employees worked at least nine hours a day, and engineers personally provided guidance, finally producing the required number by August 3rd, meeting the urgent needs of the troops.

    支援前线积极增产
    【新华社南京十三日电】南京各公营电具器材制造工厂，在支援解放大军南下的增产运动中，超出原订的生产量。电照厂七月份原计划制灯泡二万只，结果完成了二万四千一百余只。八月份该厂拟增加临时工人，以完成四万只灯泡的任务。有线电厂七月份制造交换组件五百七十门，超出原订计划一百五十门；另制装十部交换机（三十门与二十五门的各五部）。无线电厂职工们最近也完成了一项突击任务。六月底解放军某部曾向该厂订购收发报机一百部，当时该厂预定在八月中旬到九月中旬内完成，但某部因紧急需要，于上月二十三日要求该厂在八月三日以前先完成十七部。该厂接受了这一要求，将全厂员工分为六组，切实配合。职工每日至少工作九小时，工程师亦亲自指导，终于在八月三日如数制出，满足了部队紧急需要。
