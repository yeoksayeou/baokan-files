Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 27th: The CCP Central Committee Northwest Bureau recently convened a joint meeting of local Party committee secretaries from the Guanzhong New District to summarize the work in the new district in the two months since the liberation of Xi'an, and to determine that the focus of work in the coming period should be placed on the countryside first, while also taking into account the city. The meeting was attended by the secretaries of the local CCP committees of six districts: Xianyang, Weinan, Sanyuan, Dali, Jingyang, and Baoji; the secretaries of the CCP county committees of three counties: Xianyang, Chang'an, and Lintong; and staff members from the Xi'an CCP Municipal Committee and various departments and mass organizations of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government. The meeting was personally presided over by He Long, Commander of the Northwest Military Region, and Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the CCP Central Committee Northwest Bureau. It thoroughly reviewed the main tasks of various regions since liberation, such as taking over, mobilizing the masses to support the front, and eliminating local reactionary armed forces. It specifically studied and discussed Commander Lin Biao's report on the future work policy of the Central China Bureau and the Changjiang Daily editorial "Go to the Countryside, Go to the Peasant Masses!" and other documents. Everyone ideologically recognized the correctness of the policy of shifting the focus of work to the countryside while also taking into account the city after the initial takeover of urban and rural areas. Based on the socio-economic characteristics of the Northwest region, and in light of the existing foundation, experience, and shortcomings of the previous two months of work, the meeting determined the policies, plans, and steps for rural work in the new district from this autumn and winter to the next summer harvest. The meeting lasted nine days and closed on August 4th after a concluding report by Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau.

　　General He Long puts forward four opinions on future work

　　On the day before the closing, General He Long, Commander of the Northwest Military Region, spoke at the meeting. He first affirmed that the various districts had basically completed the arduous tasks of taking over urban and rural areas and supporting the war since their successive liberations, and had achieved great success, especially in disintegrating and incorporating enemy and puppet reactionary armed forces. Then he put forward the following four opinions on future work: First, we must further mobilize and organize the masses. This is the foundation of all work. The general period of propaganda and appeals has now passed, and today we should do more specific work. We should mobilize, organize, and lead the masses according to the issues that the broad masses are most concerned about today, and carry out the struggle against local bullies, bandits, and special agents in a step-by-step manner, and coordinate with tasks such as supporting the front and building political power. Second, continue to eliminate reactionary armed forces, and consolidate and develop the people's local troops. He emphasized that only by first eliminating the reactionary armed forces cleanly and thoroughly can rural social order be stabilized; otherwise, all social reforms beneficial to the people in the countryside cannot be carried out. He pointed out that various districts have achieved success in clearing and incorporating enemy and puppet reactionary armed forces in the previous two months, but have universally neglected their political education and transformation. He strictly criticized the local committees for not seriously discussing and implementing the instructions of the Northwest Bureau and the political department of the military region on incorporating reactionary armed forces, and instructed the local committees to strengthen their leadership over the sub-district command in the future, focusing on the political transformation of the incorporated armed forces, launching grievance campaigns, and raising class consciousness, so that they can not only be incorporated in form, but also gradually become the people's armed forces in political ideology. In order to quickly and thoroughly eliminate scattered bandits, he called on the local armed forces to seriously train in combat techniques, carefully study the terrain in command, grasp the enemy's situation, launch surprise attacks, pursue relentlessly, and completely annihilate them, wiping them out in one fell swoop, and eliminating future troubles for the people forever. At the same time, he pointed out that the people's local armed forces must continue to grow, and the local committees should transfer strong cadres to work in the sub-district troops. Everyone should recognize ideologically that as long as domestic and foreign class enemies exist for one day, the people's armed forces must continue to expand and improve. Third, implement streamlining and pay attention to economy. After listing phenomena such as overlapping institutions in some agencies, excessive redundant personnel in some enterprises, and waste of electricity in the city, Commander He Long pointed out that all agencies should immediately adjust their structures, reorganize personnel and horses, strictly implement the budget review system, save manpower and material resources, and tighten financial expenditures. All agencies should transfer cadres to the countryside to do mass work, and some agencies and schools do not need to live in the city, but should be dispersed out of the city, which is also a great saving. He also cited that the serious unemployment problem that existed in Xi'an in the past has not been resolved, and the organization should disperse the urban population to the countryside, on the one hand to reduce the burden of urban consumption, and on the other hand, the unemployed labor can be turned to production, which is extremely beneficial to solving personal living difficulties and increasing national wealth. Fourth, rapidly improve leadership style and working methods, and establish a scientific working system. He said that now we are working in the city, but the rural-style handicraft style is still seriously present. He listed many instances of agencies not making sufficient preparations before meetings, not setting time limits for visitors, or leaders sitting in the office without approaching the masses or making good use of cadres, resulting in uneven distribution of workload. He called for a rapid change and elimination of the tired, lax style and handicraft leadership methods, the establishment of a scientific and reasonable system, and the improvement of work efficiency. Finally, he called on all Party cadres to unite and do a good job. Cadres from the old areas and underground parties, old cadres and newly joined cadres should learn from each other, criticize each other, help each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, and make progress together.

　　中共中央西北局召开关中新区书联席会议
  　确定新区工作方针
    加强农村工作同时兼顾城市
    【新华社西安二十七日电】中共中央西北局最近曾召集关中新区各地方党委书记联席会议，总结西安解放后两个月来新区地方工作，并确定今后一定时期内工作重心先放在农村，同时兼顾城市。到会有咸阳、渭南、三原、大荔、＠县、宝鸡六个分区的中共地方委员会书记，咸阳、长安、临潼三个县的中共县委员会书记，西安中共市委会及陕甘宁边区政府各厅、各群众团体等单位工作人员。会议由西北军区司令员贺龙、中共中央西北局书记习仲勋亲自主持，详细检讨了各地自解放以来的接管工作、发动群众支援前线、消灭地方反动武装等主要工作，并特地研读和讨论了林彪司令员关于华中局今后工作方针的报告及长江日报社论“到农村去，到农民群众中去！”等文件。大家从思想上认识到了初步接管城乡以后即应将工作重心转入乡村同时兼顾城市的方针的正确性。会议根据西北地区社会经济特点，并针对前两个月工作已有的基础和经验、缺点，确定了今年秋冬至明年夏收前新区农村工作的方针、计划和步骤。会议历时九天，八月四日由西北局书记习仲勋作总结报告后闭会。
    贺龙将军　提出今后工作四项意见
    闭会前一日，西北军区贺龙司令员在会上讲话，他首先肯定各分区于先后解放以来，基本上完成了接管城乡、支援战争等艰巨任务，特别在瓦解和收编敌伪反动武装方面取得很大成绩。接着他对今后工作提出如下四项意见：第一，要进一步发动群众和组织群众。这是一切工作的根本。一般的宣传号召时期现在已过去，今天应当做更具体的工作。应按照今天广大群众最关切的问题，去发动群众，组织群众，领导群众，有步骤地开展反对恶霸，剿灭土匪，肃清特务的斗争，并配合进行支援前线和政权建设等项工作。第二，继续肃清反动武装，并巩固和发展人民的地方部队。他强调指出：只有首先把反动武装干净地彻底地消灭，农村社会秩序才能安定；否则农村中一切有利人民的社会改革便无法开展。他指出：各分区在前两月清剿与收编敌伪反动武装已获成就，但却普遍地忽视了对他们的政治教育和改造。他严格的批评了各地委没有认真讨论和贯彻西北局和区军政治部对收编反动武装的指示，并责成各地委今后应加强对分区司令部的领导，对已收编的武装着重政治改造，展开诉苦运动，提高阶级觉悟，使他们不仅在形式上被收编过来，且在政治思想上能逐渐变为人民的武装。为迅速彻底剿灭散匪，他号召各地方武装应认真训练作战技术，指挥上应精密研究地形，掌握敌情，要猛袭，穷追，全部歼灭，一网打尽，为人民永除后患。他同时指出人民的地方武装必须继续壮大，地委应抽调强的干部到分区部队工作。大家思想上应认清国内外阶级敌人存在一天，人民的武装就一定要继续扩大和提高。第三，实行精简，注意节约。贺龙司令员于列举某些机关机构重叠，某些企业中冗员过多及本市电力浪费等现象后，指出所有机关要立即调整机构，整编人员、马匹，严格执行预决算审核制度，节约人力物力，紧缩财政开支。各机关应抽出干部到农村去做群众工作，有些机关学校不必要住在城里，要疏散出城，这也是很大的节约。他又举出西安市过去存在的严重失业问题尚未解决，应该组织疏散城市人口下乡，一则减轻城市消费负担，一则失业劳力可转向生产，这对于解决个人生活困难及增加国家财富均极有利。第四，迅速改进领导作风与工作方法，建立科学的工作制度。他说现在在城市工作，而农村式的手工业作风仍严重存在。他列举很多机关开会事前不作充分准备，会客不限定时间，或领导人坐在办公室不和群众接近，不很好发挥干部力量，致有忙闲不均等现象。他号召迅速改变与革除疲塌、散漫作风与手工业的领导方法，建立科学的合理的制度，提高工作效率。最后他号召全党干部团结一致，做好工作，老区来的和地下党的，老干部和新参加工作的干部应当互相学习，互相批评，互相帮助，取长补短，共同进步。
