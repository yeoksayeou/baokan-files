New Grain from Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Line Enters the Market
Transported to Hangzhou for Sale
[Further News] In the grain-producing areas along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, new grain has successively appeared on the market. Although there were uneven rainfall and flooding this year, the impact on the early rice harvest was not severe. Generally, the yield of rice fields averages between 1 to 2 *dan* of grain per *mu*. As new grain has entered the market in various grain-producing areas, rice from Yingtan, Jinhua, Zhuji, Lanxi, and other places has been transported to Hangzhou for sale in recent days, averaging around 1,000 to 2,000 *dan* per day. The city's grain supply is abundant, and the grain shortage during the lean season has become a thing of the past.
