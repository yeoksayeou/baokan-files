　　Problems in Building Communist Youth League Organizations in Ping City Factories

　　The Youth Work Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Communist Youth League of Beiping City held a meeting of cadres for building the League in various factories on the morning of the 14th to exchange experiences in building the League, point out several problems existing in the current work, and report the opinions of the Research Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League on the work of building the League in the 70th Ordnance Factory, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, and Shijingshan Power Plant. In the afternoon, they discussed "How to closely integrate the work of the League with general production work."

　　The work of building the Communist Youth League in Beiping factories has been successful. In the past five months, the Communist Youth League has been established in sixteen larger factories, with more than 1,300 members. However, the following problems still exist in the work and need to be solved urgently.

　　Correcting the Phenomenon of Disconnection from Production

　　First, the Communist Youth League in factories has not formed a shock force in production. The leadership has failed to take an active attitude towards production, studying how to restore and develop production, and only passively ensuring that the work of the League does not hinder production. The organizational life and work inspections of the League lack content on production. This is mainly due to insufficient understanding of the tasks of the League in factories in terms of leadership thinking. In the future, League members should know that all work of the League in factories should revolve around production, and the sole purpose of all League activities is to restore, transform, and develop production. The performance of League members in production should be taken as a major item in inspecting their work. The leading cadres themselves should try their best to understand the on-site production process in order to proactively plan and promote production.

　　Getting Rid of Bureaucratism, Cultivating Cadres

　　Second, the cadres for building the League in factories have high enthusiasm for work, but they are not good at organizing and promoting the work of all parties. Many things are piled on them, forming a phenomenon of monopolizing everything. At the same time, due to the failure to cultivate cadres, once the cadres are transferred, the work of the League may not be able to be promoted. Therefore, cultivating cadres in factories in the future is one of the important and regular tasks of the leadership. Those League members who have the potential for cultivation should be given specific work, reduce their unnecessary activities and trivial tasks, increase their prestige, and plan work with them, letting them go and helping them analyze and study problems and summarize experience. In addition, the work methods should correct the phenomenon of not having a plan and grabbing at everything. A plan should be formulated according to the needs of the work in the factory and their own strength, and carried out with emphasis. And check and revise the plan at any time, summarize and promote experience in time, and improve themselves in the work.

　　Streamline League Activities, Closely Contact the Masses

　　Third, there have been too many League activities and concurrent positions for cadres in the past. There are at least two meetings every week, plus League lessons and League Day, which take up all the time after work. On the one hand, this has made the excessive organizational life in the League a burden for the members, and it will affect production when the production tasks are busy. More importantly, it makes it impossible for us to engage in general mass activities and achieve the goal of uniting and educating the broad masses of young people. In the future, we should be determined to streamline the activities of the League. Those unnecessary meetings that are not prepared and do not solve problems must not be held. The group meetings should be appropriately reduced. General learning should be with the masses. The amount of League business learning should not be too heavy, and training courses can be adopted. In the future, group meetings will be held twice a month, and the main content is to study how to promote production and mass work. There should not be too much criticism and self-criticism, and it should be done appropriately. Minor problems in daily life and style can be pointed out and corrected at any time. League Day should be strengthened, twice a month, and the content should be lively, rich, and youthful, such as conducting League ideological education, current affairs reports, debates, speeches, visits, travel, gatherings, and recreational activities, so as to contact more people through this method. The general meeting of the branch can be used flexibly, at least once a month (no more than twice), and the main content is the report of the branch's work, the arrangement and inspection of the work, the transmission of instructions from the higher level, the approval of League members and the conduct of ideological education within the League. While streamlining the activities of the League, it is necessary to strengthen the reporting work, strengthen the leadership of the group leaders, and each factory should write a written report to the Youth Work Committee every half month, using the telephone to maintain close contact.

　　In carrying out the above work, attention should be paid to cultivating a large number of activists to become the reserve force of the League, and they should be admitted to the League on the basis of conscious voluntariness.

　　At present, in the factories where the work of the League has a foundation, such as the Telecommunications Bureau, the People's Printing Factory, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Shijingshan Power Plant, and the Clothing Factory, the League should be consolidated in the development of the organization; in other factories where the foundation of the League's work is weak, such as the 70th Ordnance Factory, the League's education should be strengthened in production work, and the League should be developed in the consolidation of the organization. The Clothing Factory and the People's Printing Factory have busy production tasks and less time. In this case, the grassroots leadership should be strengthened, and the production units should be organized into groups, and problems can be discussed at any time by using a few minutes of work. Large collective activities are not easy to convene, and one or two times a month is enough. The leadership of the group leaders should be grasped, and they should be trained to take responsibility, and to keep abreast of the ideological situation of the League members and young workers, and report to the branch. At the same time, the leadership should strengthen the propaganda work according to the specific circumstances of the site or workshop, and commend the models in a timely manner to ensure the completion of the production tasks.

　　The conference finally called on the Communist Youth League of each factory to work hard and actively cooperate with the Trade Union's six major tasks in August.

### 平市工厂建团中的问题

　　平市工厂建团中的问题
    青年团北平市筹委会青工委员会于十四日上午召开各工厂建团干部会议，交流建团经验，指出目前工作上存在的几个问题，并报告团中央研究室对七十兵工厂、石景山钢铁厂、石景山发电厂建团工作的意见，下午讨论“如何在一般生产工作中密切结合团的工作”。
    北平工厂建团工作是有成绩的。五个月来，已在较大的十六个工厂建立了青年团，团员有一千三百多人。但在工作上还存在下列几个问题急需解决。
　　纠正与生产脱节现象
    一、工厂青年团在生产上未形成一支突击力量，领导上对生产未能采取积极态度，研究如何恢复发展生产，仅是消极的使团的工作不妨碍生产。团的组织生活与团的工作检查都缺乏关于生产的内容。这主要是由于领导思想上对工厂团的任务了解不够。今后应当使团员知道工厂团的一切工作都要围绕生产来进行，团的一切活动的唯一目的就是为恢复、改造、发展生产，要以团员在生产上的表现，作为检查团员工作的一个主要项目。领导干部本身则要尽可能争取了解现场生产过程，才能主动地去计划推动生产。
　　摆脱事务主义、培养干部
    二、工厂的建团干部工作热情很高，但不善于组织和推动各方面力量进行工作，好多事情就堆在他们身上，形成包办代替的现象；同时由于没有培养干部，一旦干部要调动，团的工作就有可能无法推动。所以今后在厂里培养干部是领导上重要的经常任务之一，那些有培养前途的团员应当给他们具体工作，减少他们不必要的活动和琐碎的事务工作，提高他们的威信，和他们共同计划工作，放手让他们去作，帮助他们分析研究问题，总结经验。另外，工作方法上则应当纠正没有计划，东抓一把西抓一把的现象，要根据厂内工作的需要和自己力量拟定计划，有重点的去进行。并随时检查与修正计划，及时总结，推广经验，在工作中提高自己。
　　精简团内活动，密切联系群众
    三、过去团内活动和干部兼职太多，每星期最少两次会，加上团课、团日，占满了下工以后的时间。这样一方面使团内过多的组织生活成了团员们的负担，在生产任务忙的时候并且会影响生产，更重要的是使我们不可能去搞一般的群众活动，不能达到团结教育广大青年的目的。今后应当下决心精简团内的活动，那些不必要的、没有准备的、不解决问题的会一定不开。小组会应适当减少，一般的学习应和群众在一块，团的业务学习分量不要太重，可采取训练班方式。今后小组会每月两次，主要内容是研究如何推动生产及群众工作，批评自我批评不要太多，要作的适当，日常生活上作风上的小问题，随时可以指出来改正。团日应当加强，每月两次，内容要活泼、丰富、青年化，如进行团的思想教育、时事报告、辩论会、演讲会、参观、旅行、联欢、文娱活动等，通过这种方式去联系更多的群众。支部大会可灵活运用，每月最少一次（最多不超过两次），主要内容是由支部报告工作，布置检查工作，传达上级指示，批准团员及进行团内思想教育。在精简团内活动同时，要加强汇报工作，加强小组长领导，各厂每半月向青工委员会写书面汇报一次，利用电话密切联系。
    在进行上述工作中应注意培养大批积极分子成为团的后备力量，在自觉自愿基础上吸收入团。
    目前团的工作已有了基础的工厂，如电信局、人民印制厂、石景山钢铁厂、石景山发电厂和被服厂应在发展组织中来巩固团；团的工作基础较弱的其他各厂如七十兵工厂，则要在生产工作中加强团的教育，在巩固组织中来发展团。被服厂和人民印制厂生产任务忙，时间少，这样情形应当加强基层领导，按生产单位编组，随时利用工余几分钟时间即可讨论问题，大的集体活动不易召集，一月有一两次就可以了。对小组长的领导要抓紧，培养他们负起责任来，随时掌握团员及青年工人的思想情况，向支部汇报。同时领导上则应根据现场或车间具体情况加强宣传工作，及时表扬模范，保证生产任务的完成。
    大会最后号召各厂青年团要努力工作，积极配合工会八月份六大任务。
