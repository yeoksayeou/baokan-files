　　Fengtai Stations Achieve Production Savings
  　Reduced Overhaul Turnaround, Accelerating Turnaround
    July Reduces Consumption and Increases Revenue by Over 100 Million Yuan
    [Our Newspaper] Since the launch of the production saving and meritorious service campaign in Fengtai stations and sections of the Pingjin Railway Administration in July, all employees have made great efforts to improve efficiency and reduce costs. At the beginning of the campaign, the locomotive depot proposed calculating costs to avoid production blindness. Since then, the locomotive Class A inspection department has focused on improving the quality of locomotive overhaul. All workers in the group collectively discussed that special attention should be paid to the close inspection of the contact surface of axle tiles during Class A inspections, ensuring that the rules are followed according to standards and that the angle drawings of the left and right running gear are correct. This ensured that the seven large locomotives overhauled in July (a total of nine Class A overhauls, including two small locomotives) were safely used for train traction upon leaving the factory, breaking the established practice of single-engine test runs and reducing consumption and increasing freight revenue by more than 90 million yuan. At the same time, due to the good maintenance of locomotives by the crew after contracted operation, not only has the daily mileage per locomotive increased month by month (reaching an average of 300 kilometers in July), but also the scheduled maintenance period has been generally extended. Taking locomotive No. 1939 as an example, it safely traveled 10,180 kilometers in 26 days in July. According to the bureau's standard, it should have undergone two "Class B inspections" and three "Class C inspections." As a result, it only needed to undergo one Class B inspection and one Class C inspection, saving more than 240,000 yuan in labor and material costs. In terms of transportation, since the implementation of the new traffic system and the implementation of contracted train operation in July, stations, dispatching offices, and inspection sections have begun to achieve better cooperation. Everyone, following the principles of quick loading and unloading, quick shunting, quick inspection, and quick departure, adopted a leadership method of cultivating typical examples, driving the overall situation, and initiating competitions, so that the turnaround time of freight cars was reduced from an average of seven hours per car in June to 5.3 hours; the stop time was reduced from an average of 22.8 hours per car in June to 17.6 hours, accelerating the freight car turnover rate. Calculated on the basis of an average reduction of one hour of turnaround time per car, 400 freight cars enter and leave Fengtai every day, then 400 car hours are shortened. A freight car between Fengtai and Tianjin takes about 20 hours for loading and unloading and travel. Using this shortened 400 car hours for turnover, it can travel 20 times, which can generate more than 10 million yuan in freight revenue by loading 20-grade goods. If the shortened stop time is included, it can earn more than twice as much. This proves that the above-mentioned practices are important factors for the railway to vigorously practice economy, reduce costs, and increase income. Departments that grasp this spirit and essence have achieved better results.
    The achievement of results is first based on the democratization of management and the implementation of the responsibility system. For example, before the implementation of the responsibility system for engineering, no matter how the leadership mobilized, the production plans of each road squad were always a mere formality: those with great skills dared not order too much, fearing that people would scold them for showing off; the old and weak were unwilling to order less, fearing that people would laugh at them for being useless. After the implementation of the line and tool responsibility system, the morale of the workers was improved. They prepared their own materials to repair picks and shovels; they inspected the lines they were responsible for in the rain to see if there were any abnormalities, and in the conscious establishment and adherence to the work completion inspection system, they corrected the previous bias of only focusing on quantity and ignoring quality when replacing sleepers. The second is to achieve timely commendation and criticism. For example, the station's accelerated freight car turnover rate and the locomotive depot's successful locomotive Class A inspection were promptly commended in writing and materially rewarded by the Railway Bureau; conversely, the responsible accident of locomotive No. 1784 running into the departure signal was subject to the deserved punishment. Again, at the beginning of the campaign, the workers' committee provided in-depth enlightenment on the significance of production saving and meritorious service; in the middle of the campaign, it listened to the experience of various places in Northeast China and held necessary visits, which gave the workers great encouragement.

　　丰台各站段作到生产节约
  　检修减少周转加速
    七月份减少消耗增加收入逾亿元
    【本报讯】平津铁路管理局丰台各站段自七月份开展生产节约立功运动以来，全体职工，对提高效率、减低成本，作了很大的努力。运动开始，机务段即提出计算成本，力戒生产盲目性。从此，机车甲检部，重视了提高机车检修质量，全组工友，集议甲检时应特别注意轴瓦接触面的严密检查，规矩按标准做好，和左右走行部角度图样保持正确，保证了七月份甲检的七台大型机车（共甲检九台，内有小型机车两台），出厂便安全的担任了列车牵引，打破以往单机试运转的成规，减少消耗和增加运费收入九千余万元。同时由于包乘后，乘务员对机车保修良好，不但日车公里逐月提高（七月平均达三百公里），而且普遍延长了定检期，以一九三九号机车为例，七月份二十六天，安全走行一万零一百八十公里，照局定标准应作两次“乙检”、三次“丙检”，结果只需做一次乙检，一次丙检，节省人工材料费二十四万余元。在运务方面，从七月推行新行车制和贯彻列车包乘以来，车站、调度所、检车段，开始取得较好的配合，大家在遵循快装卸、快甩挂、快检查、快开车的原则下，采取培养典型，带动全面，发起竞赛的领导方法，使货车中转时间由六月份平均每车七小时减为五点三小时；停站时间由六月份每车平均二十二点八小时减为十七点六小时，加速货车周转率。按每车平均缩短中转时间一小时计，丰台每日出入货车四百辆，则缩短了四百车时，丰台天津间一辆货车装卸及走行时间约计二十小时，利用这缩短的四百车时周转，可行驶二十次，就装载二十等物货，即能收入运费一千多万元，如果将缩短的停站时间包括在内，还可多收入一倍。这证明上述做法，是铁路厉行节约，减低成本，增加收入的重要因素。凡掌握这种精神和实质的部门，均收到了较好的效果。
    成绩的获得，首先是在管理民主化的基础上，贯彻了负责制。例如工务负责制推行之前，尽管领导上如何动员，各道班的生产计划，总是流于形式：本领大的不敢多订，怕人家骂他出风头；老弱的不肯少订，怕人家笑他没出息。待实行线路、工具负责制之后，职工情绪提高，他们自备材料修理镐锨；他们冒雨巡查所负责的线路有无异状，并在自觉建立与坚持工毕检查制当中，纠正了以往抽换枕木时只重数量、忽视质量的偏向。其次是做到了及时表扬与批评。如前面所说的车站加速货车周转率和机务段机车甲检有成绩，均及时受到路局的书面表扬和物质奖励；相反的一七八四号机车发生冒进出发信号的责任事故，则受到应得的处分。再次，运动开始，工委对生产节约立功的意义，作了深入的启发；运动中间，听取了东北各地的经验，和举行了必要的参观，给予职工很大的鼓舞。（邢军）
