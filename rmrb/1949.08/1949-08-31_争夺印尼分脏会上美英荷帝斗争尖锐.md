Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 30th:
　　The so-called "Round Table" conference between the Netherlands and Indonesian reactionaries has begun in The Hague on the 23rd, as ordered by the United States. This is a conference where American and Dutch imperialists collude with the Hatta traitorous clique and the so-called "federalist" feudal sultans to launch an attack on the Indonesian people. Due to the military failures of the Dutch colonial army, the imperialist bloc, led by American expansionists, is attempting to destroy the Indonesian people's liberation cause through political conspiracies, and to quickly establish a base in Indonesia to oppose the Asian national liberation movement. The Indonesian reactionary ringleader Hatta has been selected by American imperialism to act as a tool to implement this political conspiracy, thereby subverting the republic from within. However, the Hague "Round Table" conference is not proceeding in an "optimistic atmosphere." The struggle between the US, British, and Dutch imperialists to seize the wealthy Indonesian archipelago is intensifying. Each wants to seize more benefits from Indonesia through the "Round Table" conference. Therefore, the so-called "Round Table Conference" has actually become a spoils-sharing conference for imperialists to contend for Indonesia. The broad masses of Indonesian people, led by the Indonesian Communist Party, are persisting in the struggle for independence. Guerrilla warfare continues in Java, Sumatra, and southern Borneo. People's guerrillas are attacking Dutch plantations and police stations everywhere. The underground leading organs of the National Democratic Front of Indonesia have recently called on the people to expel the occupiers and their agents.

　　争夺印尼分脏会上美英荷帝斗争尖锐
    荷兰与印尼反动派的所谓“圆桌”会议，已按照美国的命令于二十三日在海牙举行。这是美荷帝国主义勾结哈达卖国集团与所谓“联邦派”封建苏丹联合向印尼人民进攻的会议。由于荷兰殖民军军事上的失败，以美国扩张主义者为首的帝国主义集团，正企图用政治阴谋来摧毁印尼人民的解放事业，尽速在印尼建立反对亚洲民族解放运动的基地。印尼反动头子哈达就是这样被美帝国主义选中，来充任实施这一政治阴谋从而从内部颠覆共和国的工具。可是，海牙“圆桌”会议并不是在什么“乐观气氛”中进行的，美英荷三个帝国主义争夺富庶的印尼群岛的斗争，正趋尖锐化。每一个都想通过“圆桌”会议，来夺取印尼的更多利益。因此，所谓“圆桌会议”，其实又变成了帝国主义争夺印尼的分脏会议。印尼共产党所领导的印尼广大人民坚持着争取独立的斗争。爪哇、苏门答腊和婆罗洲南部各地的游击战争，正继续进行。人民游击队到处袭击着荷兰人的庄园和警察所。印尼地下的民族民主阵线领导机关，最近号召人民驱逐占领者及其代理人。
