    Appropriately Increase Farm Product Prices
    Tangshan Trading Company
    Smoothly Carries Out Urban-Rural Trade
    [Tangshan News] The Tangshan Municipal Trading Company, in leading the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, appropriately increased the exchange price of agricultural products for industrial products based on the principle of mutual benefit between urban and rural areas, and established farmers' exchanges. These powerful measures have promoted the development of urban-rural exchange. According to statistics from the Jidong District Trading Company, from December of last year to June 15th of this year, the Trading Company purchased from major market towns, or collected through rural cooperatives and transported into the city, the following materials: 13,029,000 jin of food grain, 1,531,000 jin of peanut oil, 616,000 jin of peanuts, 4,175,000 jin of cottonseed, 3,032,000 jin of ginned cotton, 3,586,000 jin of raw cotton, 38,000 jin of pig bristles, 180,000 kiln pillars, and 84 pieces of red paper. It has achieved certain results in supplying the city with certain industrial raw materials, supporting the recovery and development of industry, stabilizing market prices, and maintaining the lives of workers in various factories and mines.
  Industrial Products Go to the Countryside
    During this period, the urban industrial products sold to the countryside included 78,000 bolts of coarse cloth, 400 bolts of striped cloth, 42,600 spools of yarn, 2,762,000 jin of bean cake, 19 barrels of paint, 235 barrels of kerosene, 629 boxes of matches, 49,000 jin of alkali, and other daily necessities, providing farmers with certain living and production materials. When a disaster occurred in Qianxi County, the Trading Company immediately set up woodyards in Tangshan, Luanxian Station, Saheqiao in Qianxi County, and Yinzhuang, purchasing mountain timber and organizing the masses in the disaster area to cut kiln pillars for production and self-rescue. Including transportation costs, it issued a total of more than 2,200,000 jin of millet, effectively alleviating the disaster situation in Qianxi County and supporting the production of the Kailuan Coal Mine, supplying sufficient kiln pillars.
  Appropriately Increase Farm Product Prices
    In the above multiple exchanges, the Trading Company, based on the principle of mutual benefit between urban and rural areas, paid attention to the relationship between the prices of industrial products and agricultural products, and appropriately and gradually increased the prices of agricultural products, guaranteeing the interests of farmers. For example, the conversion of coarse cloth and ginned cotton was that in January, more than 40 jin of ginned cotton could be exchanged for one bolt of coarse cloth, but it was gradually reduced to 28 jin of ginned cotton for one bolt of coarse cloth; in May, there was a period when 25 jin of ginned cotton could be exchanged for one bolt of coarse cloth. The conversion of yarn and ginned cotton, and the conversion of kerosene and millet, were all similar.
  Guarantee Farmers' Interests and Set Up Exchanges for Oil, Grain, etc.
    At the same time, in order to reduce the deception and exploitation of farmers by illegal merchants, the Trading Company successively established oil, grain, and cotton exchanges in Tangshan. Farmers can sell goods in the city without staying in hotels, and they can buy and sell grain even if it is not a market day, using scales and measures formulated by the government. Farmers are very happy to interact with the exchange. According to statistics from the Tangshan Oil and Grain Exchange, the amount of food grain from Fengrun, Luanxian, Changli, Lutai, Zunhua and other places that entered the market reached 6,066,165 jin in May alone. The Tangshan Yarn and Cloth Exchange sold 9,080 bolts of cloth and 14,030 spools of yarn to the countryside in April; in May, it sold 5,010 bolts of cloth and 16,850 spools of yarn to the countryside.
  Several Problems Still Existing
    At present, there are still some problems in urban-rural trade in Tangshan, mainly in the following aspects: First, although the leadership of the Trading Company paid attention to grasping price policies in the past, it failed to frequently and carefully study the conversion rate of industrial products and agricultural products, the conversion rate of finished products and raw materials, and the price differences of various materials between urban and rural areas in various periods, which affected the normal exchange of materials. Second, the municipal authorities have failed to better assist the vast number of private merchants in eliminating the obstacles to urban-rural trade, such as the example of not following the mass line when collecting road maintenance fees in transportation management, as well as the complicated tax items, etc.; and the overly complicated transaction procedures of some state-owned trading departments and the purely profit-seeking viewpoint of individual state-owned enterprises (such as when white sugar sells well in spring and black tea does not sell well, a certain trading department must attach a box of black tea to customers who buy white sugar) also affect urban-rural transactions. Third, in the past, most of the materials in the Jidong area were transported to the Northeast and Rehe for exchange. However, at present, due to the different currency systems inside and outside the customs, and the non-circulation of salt, pig bristles, and fur, coupled with different taxation methods, restrictions on purchasing procedures, and transportation difficulties (Northeast goods must be changed vehicles when transported to Shanhaiguan), all of these also affect the development of urban-rural trade.

    适当提高农产品价格
    唐山贸易公司
    顺利开展城乡贸易
    【唐山讯】唐山市贸易公司在领导城乡物资交换时，根据城乡互利原则，适当提高农产品对工业品的交换价格，并建立了农民交易所；这些有力措施，促进了城乡交换的发展。据冀东区贸易公司统计，自去年十二月至今年六月十五日贸易公司在各大集镇采购，或经农村合作社收集运进市内的物资，计有：食粮一千三百零二万九千斤，花生油一百五十三万一千斤，花生米六十一万六千斤，棉籽四百十七万五千斤，穰花三百零三万二千斤，皮棉三百五十八万六千斤，猪鬃三万八千斤，窑柱十八万根，红辛纸八十四件。供给城市一定的工业原料，扶助工业的恢复与发展，稳定市场物价，维护各厂矿职工生活，均获得一定的成绩。
  工业产品到农村去
    在此期间向农村推销的城市工业品，计有大布七万八千匹，条布四百匹，洋纱四万二千六百块，豆饼二百七十六万二千斤，颜料十九桶，煤油二百三十五桶，火柴六百二十九箱，碱面四万九千斤及其他生活必需品等，供给了农民一定的生活、生产资料。当迁西县发生灾情时，贸易公司即在唐山、滦县车站、迁西县撒河桥、尹庄等地设立木栈，收购山地木材，组织灾区群众砍伐窑柱，生产自救，连同运费在内，共发出小米二百二十万余斤，有力地缓和了迁西县的灾情，同时也支持了开滦煤矿的生产，供给了足够的窑柱。
  适当提高农产品价格
    在以上多次交换中，贸易公司本着城乡互利的原则，注意了工业品与农产品价格的关系，适当地、逐渐地提高了农产品价格，保障了农民的利益，如大布与穰花的换算，在一月份是以四十斤以上的穰花换一匹大布，后来逐渐减到穰花廿八斤换一匹大布；五月份有一时期达到穰花廿五斤换一匹大布。洋纱与穰花的换算，煤油与小米的换算，亦均如此。
  保障农民利益  设油粮等交易所
    同时为了减少不法商人对于农民的欺骗与剥削，贸易公司又先后在唐山建立了油粮、棉花的交易所，农民进城出卖货物，可以不住店，不是集日也可买卖粮食，使用经政府制定的斗秤，农民极乐于与交易所往来，据唐山油粮交易所统计，来自丰润、滦县、昌黎、芦台、遵化等地的食粮上市量：五月份一个月即达六百零六万六千一百六十五斤；唐山市纱布交易所四月份销到农村的布类达九千零八十匹，纱一万四千零三十块；五月份销到农村的布匹达五千零一十匹，纱一万六千八百五十块。
  目前尚存在的几个问题
    目前唐市在城乡贸易中仍存在着一些问题，主要有以下各点：一、贸易公司的领导上过去虽然注意了掌握价格政策，但未能经常地缜密地研究工业品与农业品的换算率，成品与原料的换算率。各个时期各种物资城乡价格的差额等问题，影响物资的正常交流。二、市当局未能更好地协助广大私商消除城乡贸易的障碍，如在交通管理上征收养路费时不走群众路线的例子，以及税收项目繁琐等等；而某些公营贸易部门交易手续过于麻烦，和个别公营企业单纯的营利观点（如春季白糖销路好，红茶销不畅时，某贸易部门对买白糖的客人，一定要附卖红茶一箱等）也使城乡交易受到影响。三、过去冀东地区物资，大部运往东北与热河交换，然而目前由于关内外币制的不同，和食盐、猪鬃、皮毛互不流通，再加征税方法不同，采购手续有限制，运输困难（东北货物运到山海关须换车）等原因，也都影响了城乡贸易的发展。（冀东区贸易公司材料）
