Carnival on the Danube
　　Budapest Correspondence

The World Youth and Student Festival celebrated one of the most joyous days of its schedule on the 20th - the "Carnival on the Danube."

The 20th was also Hungary's harvest festival, which made the festival even more splendid. Hungarian farmers, both men and women, young and old, who had been liberated and received land, all put on new clothes, some with flower headscarves, and came to the city in groups to visit the festival. They also brought gifts such as large loaves of bread made with new wheat and fruit, and gave them to youth delegations from various countries. The festival's exhibition, stadium, motorcycle racecourse, and park were even more lively because of the addition of these many guests. The charity market selling festival souvenirs was packed with customers.

　　Chinese Art Troupe's Yangko Dance Receives Praise from 150,000 Spectators

The Chinese delegation's art troupe performed the Yangko dance, attracting 150,000 people and receiving unanimous praise. At another large-scale concert with 10,000 listeners, Hungarian farmers presented a large loaf of bread weighing several kilograms to the Chinese delegation, expressing their friendship with the Chinese people.

According to generations of tradition, Hungarian farmers eat bread made from new wheat during the harvest festival. The ten thousand young representatives from various countries participating in the festival were all treated to this on this day.

　　　　Lights Shine Brightly on Both Banks of the Danube, Delegations from Various Countries Take a Night Cruise

At seven o'clock in the evening, the lights of major buildings on both banks of the Danube River, which cuts through the city of Budapest, were brightly lit, and the lights on the Parliament building were even more dazzling. The "Carnival on the Danube" officially began. Thirteen brand-new steamships, flying the Hungarian flag and red flags, carrying ten thousand young representatives from various countries, slowly cruised along the Danube River, past the foothills of the Statue of Liberty and Margaret Island. Each ship's bow was decorated with flags, and the hull was adorned with patterns and emblems woven from thousands of lights. In the shimmering light and shadow, the Danube River was suddenly filled with the laughter and songs of young people from more than eighty countries. When two steamships met in the middle of the river, the young people on the decks exchanged greetings and cheers. Both banks of the Danube and the four bridges spanning the river and connecting the city were filled with the people of Budapest, who waved to the young people on the ships, and the young people responded with cheers of "VIT, VIT, Hurrah!" (VIT is the abbreviation for "World Youth and Student Festival" in Hungarian).

　　Chinese and Vietnamese Representatives on the Same Ship, Singing "The East is Red" with Abandon

The Chinese delegation was on the same ship as representatives from Vietnam, Bulgaria, East Germany, the United States, Australia, Belgium, and other countries. From Young Pioneers to members of the Communist Youth League, everyone became younger and more joyful. Songs such as "March of the Democratic Youth," "March of the Motherland," and "The East is Red" were sung in turn and with abandon. After the small meal, everyone pulled out their chairs and danced on the deck. Young people from various countries gathered everywhere on the ship to talk, learn about each other's struggle history, and the customs of various nationalities. The Chinese representatives also received widespread attention here. Young people from various countries expressed their congratulations on the great victory of the Chinese people. When exchanging souvenirs, those who received a Mao Zedong badge felt great honor and pride. They shook hands tightly with the Chinese representatives to express their gratitude and boasted about it to their companions. The members of the Chinese delegation's art troupe, who had just performed the Yangko dance, were still dressed as farmers on the ship.

At a little after ten o'clock, salutes began to be fired and fireworks were set off on the hillsides along the river. The sound of cannons echoed in the valleys, and the beautiful fireworks rolled and shone in the sky, sometimes like a long rainbow, sometimes like ten thousand red lanterns, changing endlessly. At eleven o'clock, the cruise ships docked, and many enthusiastic and friendly residents of Budapest were waiting on the shore to greet them, chatting and shaking hands for half an hour.

　　多瑙河上的狂欢节
  　布达佩斯通讯
    世界青年与学生联欢大会在二十日欢度大会日程中一个最欢乐的日子——“多瑙河上的狂欢节”。
    二十日也正是匈牙利的收获节，这使得联欢大会更加光彩。已经解放而得到土地的匈牙利农民，男女老少都穿上新衣，有的包上花头巾，成群结队地进城来观光联欢大会。他们并带来自己用新麦子做的大面包和水果等礼品，送给各国青年代表团。联欢大会的展览会、运动场、摩托车比赛场和公园中，因为增加这许多来宾而更加热闹。出售联欢大会纪念品的义卖市场，顾客盈门。
  　中国文工团的秧歌舞　获得十五万观众赞美
    中国代表团的文工团表演了大秧歌舞，吸引了十五万人，并得到了一致的赞美。在另一个有一万听众的大规模的演奏会上，匈牙利农民将一个好几公斤重的大面包献给中国代表团，表示他们对中国人民的友谊。
    按照世代相传的习俗，匈牙利农民在收获节都吃新麦子做的面包。各国参加联欢大会的一万青年代表，这一天都受到了这种招待。
    　　　　多瑙河两岸灯火齐明　各国代表团乘船夜游
    傍晚七点钟，横切布达佩斯城的多瑙河两岸各大建筑的灯火齐明，国会建筑上的灯光，更辉煌夺目。“多瑙河上的狂欢节”正式开始了。十三艘飘扬着匈牙利国旗和红旗的焕然一新的汽船，载着各国的一万名青年代表，沿着耸立自由神像的山麓和马格兰岛，在平静无波的多瑙河上缓缓周游。每艘船的船头上旗帜招展，船身都装饰着千百盏灯光编织的图案和徽号。灯光波影中，多瑙河上顿时充满了八十多个国家青年人的欢笑和歌声。当两只汽船在中流相遇的时候，甲板上的青年们就互致敬礼和欢呼。多瑙河两岸和横跨河上连接市区的四座大桥上，站满了布达佩斯的人民，他们对船上的青年们挥手致意，青年们就报以“ＶＩＴ，ＶＩＴ，乌拉！”的欢呼（ＶＩＴ是匈牙利文“世界青年与学生联欢大会”的简称）
  　中越代表同乘一船　纵情歌唱“东方红”
    中国代表团和越南、保加利亚、东德、美、澳、比等国代表同在一艘船上。从少先队员到青年团员，都变得更加年青、更加愉快了。“民主青年进行曲”、“祖国进行曲”、“东方红”等一只又一只名歌，被轮流不停地纵情歌唱着。用完了小餐以后，大家又拉开椅子，在甲板上跳起舞来。船上到处都有各国的青年聚首倾谈，了解彼此的斗争历史和各民族的生活习俗。中国代表在这里同样也受到普遍的注意。各国青年对中国人民的伟大胜利都表示祝贺。彼此交换纪念品时，换到毛泽东纪念章的，都感觉很大的光荣和骄傲。他们和中国代表紧紧握手，表示感谢，并向他们的同伴夸耀不已。刚表演过大秧歌舞的中国代表团文工团的团员们，在船上仍然是农夫农妇的打扮。
    十点多钟了，河畔山头上开始鸣礼炮、放焰火。炮声在山谷中萦绕回荡，美丽的焰火在天空翻腾照耀，一会儿象长虹，一会儿红灯万盏，变幻无穷。十一点钟，游船拢岸，有很多热情友爱的布达佩斯居民们在岸上迎候，欢谈握手，达半点钟之久。
