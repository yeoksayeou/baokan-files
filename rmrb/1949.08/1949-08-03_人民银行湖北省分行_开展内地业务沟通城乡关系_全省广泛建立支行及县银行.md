Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 2nd: In order to rapidly develop inland business and connect urban and rural relations, the Hubei Branch of the People's Bank of China has established seven branches in Xiaogan, Huanggang, Mianyang, Daye, Xiangyang, Jiangling, Yichang, and other places, and county banks have been established in more than 60% of the counties. In early June, the provincial branch and its branches, in coordination with the government's measures to prohibit the circulation of silver dollars, organized work teams to go to various counties, towns, and rural areas to launch a movement to reject the use of silver dollars. At present, local people's governments are organizing large-scale commercial transportation to invigorate trade relations. Therefore, in July, prices in various places have generally fallen by one-third. According to the branch's work plan for July, August, and September, the first priority is to establish and improve the organizational structure of the branch offices, reduce the branch office structure, in order to extract cadres to strengthen the county agencies. At the same time, organize currency distribution to the countryside, establish exchange offices, launch a province-wide movement for the people to resolutely reject the use of silver dollars, and cooperate with trade companies to effectively lead the market. In addition, organize cooperative, transportation, and production loans to support production, sales, and the export of mountain products, and organize the people to produce in order to survive the famine.
