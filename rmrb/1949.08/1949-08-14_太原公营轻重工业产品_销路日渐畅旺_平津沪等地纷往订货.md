Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 12th: Sales of publicly-owned light and heavy industrial products in Taiyuan are expanding daily, with an increasing number of people coming to the city to place orders from North China, Northwest China, Shanghai, and other places. The Railway Department of the Chinese Revolutionary Military Commission previously ordered a large quantity of rails, spikes, fishplates, and screws from the Northwest Iron and Steel Company and has now placed another large order with the company for fishplate screws, pig iron, steel ingots, square and round iron, and lead wire. The Industry and Commerce Department of the North China People's Government recently purchased 5,000 tons of cement from the Taiyuan Cement Company, and the Tianjin Iron Wire Factory purchased forty tons of eight-strand spring steel from the steel mill. In addition, seven tons of artificial camphor have been shipped to Shanghai. As urban-rural exchange gradually becomes smoother, Taiyuan-produced matches, cigarettes, and other products are already in short supply. The Shanxi Industrial Management Office plans to ship large quantities of woolen textiles, cement, paper, bleaching powder, caustic soda, etc., to Shanghai and Xi'an in mid-August.

    太原公营轻重工业产品
    销路日渐畅旺
    平津沪等地纷往订货
    【新华社太原十二日电】太原市公营轻重工业产品销路日益广阔，华北、西北、上海等地来本市订货者日多。中国革命军事委员会铁道部前曾向西北钢铁公司订购大批道轨、道钉、夹板、螺丝，现又向该公司订购大量夹板螺丝、生铁、钢锭、方圆铁及铅丝等。华北人民政府工商部最近亦向太原洋灰公司购洋灰五千吨，天津铁线工厂向炼钢厂购买了八＠盘簧钢四十吨。另有洋樟脑七吨已输沪。由于城乡交流逐渐顺畅，太原所产火柴、纸烟等皆已供不应求。山西工业管理处拟于八月中旬以大批毛织品、洋灰、纸张、漂粉、火碱等，分别运往上海和西安。
