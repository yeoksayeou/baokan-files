[This Municipality News] The city health bureau launched a clean-up fly-swatting blitz that ran from July 29th to August 9th. Over 32 million flies were eradicated in the urban and suburban areas of the city. The Health Bureau loaded the captured flies onto trucks on the morning of the 13th at 10:00 AM and burned them all in the eastern suburbs.

Participating in this blitz were personnel from the Health Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, the People's Liberation Army, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and over 30 labor unions, dispatching more than 1,000 people. It mobilized over 500,000 citizens from all walks of life in the city's urban and suburban areas, including workers, farmers, troops stationed in the city, students, and the general public.

The city's twelve districts organized 120 blitz teams, ten teams per district. Each team was originally planned to have five members, but due to extensive publicity and mobilization by the staff, the movement became a movement of the citizens themselves, with some teams reaching over 40 or 50 people.

The scope of this clean-up fly-swatting campaign was very broad, including killing maggots, preventing flies, and clearing street feces and other garbage, all of which have been completed simultaneously. The bureau is now summarizing the experience of this blitz.

    【本市讯】市卫生局所发动的清洁捕蝇突击运动，从七月二十九日开始到八月九日为止，全市城内郊区捕灭苍蝇三千二百多万头。卫生局已于十三日上午十时把所捕的苍蝇用汽车装到东郊外全部烧灭。
    参加这次突击工作的人员，有卫生局、公安局，解放军、市商会及三十多个工会，出动人员达一千人以上，发动了本市城郊区各界市民有五十多万人，包括了工人、农民、驻军、学生和一般市民。
    全市十二个区，组织了一百二十个突击小组，每区十个小组；小组原定为五人，由于工作人员广泛的宣传动员，使这个运动成了市民群众自己的运动，各小组有达到四五十人以上的。
    这次清洁捕蝇运动的范围，十分广泛，包括灭蛆、防蝇、清除街头粪便及其它垃圾等项，亦已同时完成。该局现正总结这一突击工作的经验。
