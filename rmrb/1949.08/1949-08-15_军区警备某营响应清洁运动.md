    A Military Region Garrison Battalion Responds to the Clean-Up Campaign
    [This City News] A certain garrison battalion of the North China Military Region is enthusiastically responding to the city's Sanitation Bureau's call for a clean-up. The battalion Party committee first held a meeting to decide on the clean-up organization and specific methods. Subsequently, each company held branch committee meetings and soldiers' conferences to mobilize and arrange the work. Company-level cadres and each platoon also made specific divisions of labor and sent four groups to conduct clean-up propaganda to residents in the stationed area. The entire battalion designated last week as "Clean-Up Blitz Week." Cadres took the lead, everyone pitched in, and successfully completed the task on the weekend. In recent days, many exemplary examples have emerged on the "blackboard newspapers" and "class life newspapers." The battalion committee also convened cadres from each company on the 10th to conduct a major cleaning inspection. Due to the close organization and thorough mobilization of this clean-up, the results were greater than in previous times, especially the fourth company achieved the best results. Other companies also made significant progress in tidying up kitchens, pigsties, and removing dirty water and garbage from inside and outside the rooms. (Yang Zhen)

    【本市讯】华北军区警备某营热烈响应市卫生局清运号召。营党委会首先开会议定清运组织和具体办法。接着各连都先后召开支委会和军人大会，进行动员布置工作。连级干部和各排也都具体分工，并派出四个小组向驻区市民进行清运宣传。全营定上周为“清运突击周”，干部带头，人人动手，于周末胜利完成任务。连日“黑板报”上、“班生活报”上，涌现许多模范例子。营委会并于十日召集各连干部，举行了清洁大检查。这次清运由于组织严密，动员深入，收效比历次都大，尤以第四连的成绩最好，其他各连在整理伙房、猪圈及清除室内外的脏水和垃圾上，也都有显著的成绩。    （杨振）
