Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st. Due to serious bureaucratic practices in its management, the Shenyang Smelting Plant failed to grasp key departments in the production process and lacked an economic accounting ideology. As a result, in the seven months since its takeover, it not only failed to complete production tasks according to plan but also experienced serious waste, causing huge losses of state property. Since May 24th, under the direct leadership of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Industrial Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee, the Non-ferrous Metals Bureau, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee, the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions, and cadres from all aspects of the plant conducted a serious and practical inspection of the plant. Lasting a month, they convened meetings of the plant's employee representatives, symposiums of technical personnel, and meetings of trade union cadres at all levels, extensively promoting democracy and listening to employee opinions. Finally, a consensus was reached, and conclusions were drawn, using the lessons of the plant's production management failure as a reference for improving the management methods of all factories and enterprises.

The Shenyang Smelting Plant is directly under the Northeast Non-ferrous Metals Administration. At the time of the takeover, the plant's machinery, buildings, and other equipment were largely intact. When work began in January this year, the technical conditions were generally adequate, and the raw materials were also guaranteed. However, the plant's production performance since the start of operations has been far from meeting its targets. According to inspection results, from January to April, the quantity of electrolytic copper produced was only 77% of the original plan on average. In May, production could not proceed normally due to damage to the electric roller, completing only 50.8% of the plan. Due to the failure to fully utilize labor and machine efficiency in the production process, and poor management of raw materials, waste was significant, resulting in extremely high costs. The processing fee for one ton of electrolytic copper (excluding mining and transportation costs) reached approximately 154.9 million Northeast currency, roughly equivalent to or slightly higher than the price of copper transported from other locations. There were also many unreasonable phenomena in the production process, wasting money in the hundreds of millions. The occurrence of these phenomena was mainly due to serious shortcomings in production management. The electrical room providing power, the ore smelting furnace that melts ore into matte, the Bessemer converter that smelts matte into blister copper, and the close coordination between the ore smelting furnace and the Bessemer converter (closely coordinating the time and quantity of liquid matte entering the Bessemer converter to avoid waste of labor, materials, and efficiency due to matte solidification) are the four key aspects of the plant's production. However, administrative management failed to grasp these key areas, resulting in long-term unresolved serious problems. For example, the electrical room has frequently experienced power and air outages due to internal accidents for several months. The spare electric roller was damaged and not repaired in a timely manner, nor was it reported, until the 225-horsepower electric roller in use also broke down before the factory director became aware, but the loss could not be recovered, and operations were forced to temporarily halt. Furthermore, due to irresponsible operations in the room, the power switch was opened without reason, resulting in damage to 170 valuable seed plates (blister copper adheres to a plate through electrolysis to become electrolytic copper, this plate is called a seed plate) in the electrolytic tanks. Each time an accident occurred, the factory director neither conducted an inspection nor pursued accountability, simply inquiring casually and letting it go. The ore smelting furnace had low air pressure, which affected ore smelting efficiency and the poor quality of the matte. The Ministry of Industry had already approved the plant to replace the hearth of the smelting furnace with magnesia bricks to increase air pressure, but the plant delayed transporting the magnesia bricks for more than a month. The ore smelting furnace also experienced a serious violation of production discipline where technicians and staff arbitrarily changed the batching standards and used excessive amounts of copper blocks. Afterward, the administrative leadership did not pursue the matter. In the Bessemer converter section, the operation technology was too low, which failed to give full play to its role. Two advanced workers whose operating skills were close to the level of the puppet Manchuria regime had appeared in the department, but the leadership did not pay attention to rewarding them or educating other workers to emulate them, so the technical level of the department could not be universally improved. Because the ore smelting furnace and Bessemer converter were not well coordinated, the loss caused by matte solidifying into copper blocks alone amounted to 3 billion yuan in four months. In terms of labor organization, if organized reasonably, the plant could reduce its workforce by 12% to 18% compared to the current situation.

The creation of waste phenomena of this kind is due to the plant's lack of an industrial management ideology based on economic accounting. They don't plan, don't study costs, and don't realize that the so-called production task does not simply refer to production quantity; it must include cost accounting, and the products produced must be economically sound. The plant's CPC branch and trade union work were seriously detached from production. For a considerable period, trade union cadres did not know the production plan, nor did they organize workers to learn from advanced elements, so they could not carry out a movement to improve technology among workers. Workers' representative meetings only became a tool for conveying administrative opinions and could not play a role in improving and improving production. The work of uniting and transforming old technicians was also done poorly, so that a few technicians still retained the ideological style of suppressing workers.

After this inspection, the plant has begun to correct the above-mentioned errors and shortcomings. The Northeast Daily published a short commentary on this, requiring all enterprises and factories to learn from the lessons of the smelting plant in production management, improve the management of factories and enterprises, prevent accidental losses of the people's motherland's property, and increase production efficiency.

    工厂企业改进管理借鉴
    东北冶炼厂
    检查官僚主义
    必须掌握生产关键部门
    树立严格经济核算思想
    【新华社沈阳一日电】沈阳冶炼厂由于管理上存在着严重的官僚主义作风，未掌握生产过程中的关键部门及缺乏经济核算思想，以致在接管以来的七个月中，不仅没有按计划完成生产任务，且发生严重浪费现象，造成国家财产的浩大损失。自五月二十四日开始，在中共中央东北局直接领导下，由东北行政委员会工业部、有色金属局、东北职工总会、中共沈阳市委、沈市职工总会及该厂各方面干部共同对该厂进行了一次认真切实的检查，历时一个月，先后召开了该厂职工代表会议、技术人员座谈会及各级工会干部会议，广泛发扬民主，倾听职工意见，最后取得一致意见，作出结论，并以该厂生产管理失败的教训，作为一切工厂企业改进管理方法的借鉴。
    沈阳冶炼厂直属东北有色金属管理局，在接管时，该厂机器、厂房及其他设备等大体完整无损；今年一月份开工时，技术条件一般都很具备，原料亦有保证。但是该厂开工以来的生产成绩，距完成任务却相差很远。根据检查结果，一至四月，产电解铜的数量，平均只为原计划的百分之七十七；五月份因电滚损坏，生产无法正常进行，仅完成计划百分之五十点八。由于生产过程中劳动力和机器效能没有充分发挥，原料材料管理不善，浪费很大，致成本极高。一吨电解铜的加工费（不包括矿石开采及运输费）达东北币一亿五千四百九十万元左右，约相当于或略高于外地运来的铜价。在生产过程中也有许多不合理的现象，浪费金钱以亿计。这些现象的发生，主要由于生产管理方面存在着严重的缺点。该厂供给动力的电气室、由矿石熔为冰铜的熔矿炉、把冰铜冶炼为粗铜的真吹炉以及熔矿炉和真吹炉的密切操作（使液体的冰铜进入真吹炉的时间和数量密切衔接，避免因冰铜凝结而遭致劳动力、材料、效率等的浪费），是该厂生产的四大关键，但行政管理方面未抓紧这些关键，以致长期地存在着严重问题不能解决。例如电气室数月来常因内部事故而停电停风；备用的电滚坏了不及时修好，也不报告，直到正在运用的二百二十五匹马力的电滚也坏了，厂长才知道，但损失已无法弥补，被迫暂时停工。又如该室因操作不负责任，无故拉开电闸，使民解槽里一百七十块贵重的种板（粗铜经电解作用附着于一块板上成为篆铜，此板名为种板）遭致损坏。当每次事故发生后，该厂厂长既不进行检查，又不追究责任，只轻描淡写地查问一下便算了事。熔矿炉因风压太低而影响到熔矿效能和冰铜质量低劣。工业部早已批准该厂将熔炉前床改用镁砖以提高风压，但厂方拖了一个多月未将镁砖运到。熔矿炉并曾发生过技师和职员擅改配料标准，过多使用铜块的严重违犯生产纪律的事件，事后行政体领导上也未加追究。真吹炉部分，由于操作技术太低，以致未能充分发挥其作用。部内曾先后出现了两名操作技术接近于伪满水平的先进工人，但领导上没有注意奖励，也未教育其他工人向之看齐，以致该部技术水平不能普遍提高。因为熔矿炉和真吹炉配合不好，四个月来单因冰铜凝为铜块而造成的损失即达三十亿元。在劳动力的组织上，如组织合理，全厂可较目前减少百分之十二到十八。
    诸如此类的浪费现象的造成，是由于厂方缺乏经济核算的工业管理思想，不打算盘，不研究成本，没有认识到所谓生产任务，绝不是单指生产数量，必须包括成本核算，必须使生产出来的产品是经济上合算的。该厂中共党的支部和工会工作则是严重地脱离了生产。工会干部相当长的时期不知道生产计划，也没有组织工人向先进分子看齐，因而无法在工人中开展提高技术的运动。工人代表会议只成了传达行政意见的工具，起不了提高和改善生产的作用。团结和改造旧技术人员的工作亦做得很差，以致少数技术人员仍保存着压制工人的思想作风。
    该厂经过此次检查后，对上述各项错误和缺点正开始纠正中。东北日报为此发表短评，要求各企业工厂在生产管理上接受冶炼厂的教训，改进工厂企业的管理，使人民祖国的财产免受意外损失，并增进生产效能。
