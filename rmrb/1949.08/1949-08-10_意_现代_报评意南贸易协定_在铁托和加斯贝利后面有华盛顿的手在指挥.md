Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th: TASS, Rome dispatch: The Italian and Tito groups signed a trade agreement on August 4th. Except for "Il Messaggero," which called it "the cornerstone of economic cooperation between Italy and Yugoslavia," other official Italian newspapers avoided commenting on the agreement. According to "Modern" newspaper: "Everyone understands that Washington's hand is behind this action. Tito is a valuable tool in Washington's hands, and his statements regarding the Balkan communist parties are entirely consistent with the propaganda goals of Western countries, primarily the United States."

The newspaper believes that the conclusion of a trade agreement between the Italian government and Tito is the prelude to the partition of the Free Territory of Trieste.

L'Unità editorial pointed out: In the relationship between Tito and the Americans, "there is no need for intermediaries, because the clinking of gold coins is law in the Yugoslav capital... Tito serves the United States better than De Gasperi and Sforza, because his strategic and political situation, in the efforts to provoke war, in the fight against the interests of the working people of the world, can play an important role."

    意“现代”报评意南贸易协定
    在铁托和加斯贝利后面有华盛顿的手在指挥
    【新华社北平九日电】塔斯社罗马讯：意大利与铁托集团间于八月四日签订了贸易协定，意官方报纸除“报信者”报称之为“意大利与南斯拉夫间经济合作的基石”之外，其他则避不评论协定。据“现代”报称：“人人都明白，华盛顿的手是在这一行动的后面的。铁托是华盛顿手中的有价值的工具，他的关于巴尔干各共产党的声明，与西方国家首先是美国的宣传目的完全一致。”
    该报相信意大利政府和铁托间的缔结贸易协定，是瓜分的里雅斯特自由区的序幕。
    团结报社论指出：在铁托与美国人的关系中，“是不需要中间人的，因为金元的叮当声在南斯拉夫京城便是法律……铁托比加斯贝利和史佛卓对美国服务得要好些，因为他的战略和政治形势，在挑拨战争的努力中，在为反对世界劳动人民的利益而战斗中，可以起重要的作用”。
