　　Responding to the Call of the All-Soviet Union Peace Conference
    The All-Soviet Union Peace Conference was held on the 25th of this month. 1,200 representatives from all over the country enthusiastically discussed writer Tikhonov's report on "Fighting bravely and confidently for peace" and unanimously resolved to establish a permanent committee of the All-Soviet Union Peace Conference, passed the "Letter to the Permanent Committee of the World Peace Congress and Peace Advocates of All Countries" and the "Salute to Stalin Letter", and victoriously concluded on the 27th. The Soviet Union, the powerful fortress for defending world peace, this resolute action to safeguard peace will undoubtedly win the support of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world, and the warmongers of Wall Street have suffered another heavy blow.
    Two hundred million Soviet people have formed a giant, under the leadership of the great Stalin, holding high the banner of constructive labor and defending world peace, standing at the forefront of the struggle to maintain international security and peace democracy. Any war criminals who dare to undermine the fruits of the Soviet people's labor, in the past, have fallen; in the future, they will also fall! The Soviet people have enough power to crush the spines of the warmongers. This firm belief and unparalleled power were once again powerfully expressed at this All-Soviet Union Peace Conference.
    The All-Soviet Union Peace Conference successfully showed the world the inevitable victory of the peace camp. As guests from various countries unanimously stated: "This conference will further strengthen the belief of hundreds of millions of men and women, making them believe that they have the ability to stop a new war!"
    We Chinese people love peace. In order to achieve the peaceful happiness and democratic and free life of our domestic people, in the great liberation war against American imperialist enslavement and eliminating the heinous rule of the American imperialist running dog Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary faction, we have spared no blood and sacrifice. We have defeated the reactionary faction armed by American imperialism with six billion US dollars and achieved the basic victory of the revolutionary war.
    We, the Chinese people, have already responded to the call of the All-Soviet Union Peace Conference with victorious struggle. We will continue to relentlessly expose the bloody crimes of the instigators of a new war, answer their every attack with struggle, and rapidly and completely eliminate the remnants of the American imperialist running dog Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary faction in our country. Together with the Soviet Union and the people of the world, we will, with unified will and action, completely defeat the arrogant plans of the imperialist warmongers.

　　响应全苏拥护和平大会的号召
    全苏拥护和平大会于本月二十五日召开，一千二百名来自国内各地的代表热烈地讨论了作家吉洪诺夫“勇敢而有信心地为和平而斗争”的报告，并一致决议成立全苏拥护和平大会常设委员会，通过“致世界拥护和平大会常设委员会和世界各国拥护和平者书”及“向斯大林致敬书”以后，已于二十七日胜利闭幕。保卫世界和平的强大堡垒——苏联，这一坚决维护和平的举动，无疑将获得世界亿万爱好和平人民的拥护，华尔街的战争贩子们又受到了沉重的一击。
    苏联两亿人民结成一个巨人，在伟大的斯大林领导下，高举着建设性劳动和保卫世界和平的大旗，站在维护国际安全与和平民主斗争的最前列。任何一个胆敢破坏苏联人民劳动成果的战争罪犯，在过去，都倒下来了；未来的，也同样要倒下去！苏联人民有足够的力量击碎战争贩子的脊骨。这一个坚定的信念与强大无比的力量，在这次全苏拥护和平大会上是又一次地有力地表示出来了。
    全苏拥护和平大会是成功地向世界人民显示了和平阵营的必然胜利。正如各国来宾一致表示的：“这个大会将进一步加强亿万男女的信念，使他们相信他们有阻止新战争的能力！”
    我们中国人民爱好和平，为了获致我们国内人民的和平幸福与民主自由的生活，我们在反对美帝奴役、消灭美帝走狗蒋介石反动派罪恶统治的伟大解放战争中，不惜洒鲜血，抛头颅，我们已经击败了由美帝用六十亿美元武装起来的反动派，取得了革命战争的基本胜利。
    我们中国人民，已经以胜利的斗争响应了全苏拥护和平大会的号召。我们更将继续无情地揭发新战争挑拨者的血腥罪恶，用斗争回答它们的每一次进攻，在我们国内迅速彻底消灭美帝走狗蒋介石反动派的残余，和苏联及全世界人民一起，以统一的意志与行动，彻底击败帝国主义的战争贩子们的狂妄计划。
