(Reported by this newspaper) Hangzhou News: In central and southern Zhejiang, with the cooperation of the People's Liberation Army and local armed forces, over 6,000 bandits were eliminated in June and July. In southern Zhejiang, the "7th Detachment of the Righteous and Brave Volunteer Corps" bandit gang in Huzhen, northeast of Jinyun, the Wang Xiaoyi bandit gang in Songmen, a salt production and distribution center in southern Zhejiang, and the Jin Xiaoxian bandit gang in Shangpanshi, northeast of Linhai, were successively attacked, resulting in over 500 bandits killed, wounded, or captured. The People's Liberation Army operating in the Linhai and Xianju areas of southern Zhejiang recently annihilated over 300 bandits from gangs such as the "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army." According to incomplete statistics from central Zhejiang, 4,997 bandits were eliminated in over fifty days. In Lanxi County alone, 155 bandits were eliminated or captured in June, including over 60 who surrendered with their weapons due to political offensives and being won over. The Hangzhou Garrison Command, in conjunction with the Military Control Commission's Public Security Department, surrounded and captured the headquarters of the "Jiangnan Guerrilla Column of the Youth National Salvation Corps of the Ministry of National Defense" armed bandit special force, which was attempting to ambush our vehicles on the Hangzhou-Huizhou Highway near Gudang on the 30th of last month. Eleven people were captured, including Dai Yingming, a lieutenant adjutant, and Zhang Zhonghua, a major group leader of the assault team. Highly confidential communiqués regarding the bandit unit's deployment of activities and the "Roster of Officers" of the bandit's independent detachment were seized. The Yuqian County People's Government, in coordination with the local People's Liberation Army, launched three offensives to suppress the remnants of the "First Detachment of the Fourth Column of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters," which frequently operated in the Tianmu Mountain, Dingshan, Langshan, and Qingshandian areas, harassing and harming the people, killing, wounding, or capturing approximately 80 bandits.
