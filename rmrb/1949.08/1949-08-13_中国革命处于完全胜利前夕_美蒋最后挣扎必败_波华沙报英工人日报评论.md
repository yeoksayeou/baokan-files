    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 12th: Polish News Agency, Warsaw, 9th dispatch stated: "Warsaw Newspaper" published an editorial commenting on the US government's white paper on US policy toward China, saying: This document emphasizes that the US imperialists will spare no effort to maintain their influence in China at all costs. The white paper also declares that the United States opposes any "foreign interference" in China. When this statement is announced by a country that has sent aircraft, tanks, ammunition, and dollars to China in the past few years, it is surprising. Senator Vandenberg supplemented this document by saying that he did not believe that the Communist "aggression" in China was of a lasting nature. "Aggression" - this is the definition that US imperialists have given to the glorious liberation of a nation with 450 million people. As for the so-called "lasting nature," we can well recall that the US imperialists said the same thing after the outbreak of the great Russian October Revolution in 1917. At that time, they also sought comfort from the idea that "the revolution is not of a lasting nature." The newspaper concluded: The great Chinese revolution is on the eve of complete victory, and the last-ditch struggle of Chiang Kai-shek, Jessup, and Vandenberg will be of no practical use.
    In addition, the British Daily Worker published an editorial titled "Complete Failure," stating: The US White Paper on China is a record of the complete and utter failure of US imperialist policy. After quoting Acheson's statement that the United States will encourage the development of all factors aimed at overthrowing the new democratic China, the newspaper emphasized: This is a new declaration of war, full of fierce intimidation, and foreshadows new conspiracies and interference. The Chinese People's Democratic authorities will know how to answer and deal with it. The newspaper warned the British government: If the British government also acts on this basis (the provocative Amethyst incident and the Hong Kong incident are enough to prove this), it will be its disaster. Britain has only one path, and that is to: diplomatically recognize the new China and establish full trade relations with the new China on the basis of freedom and equality.

    中国革命处于完全胜利前夕
    美蒋最后挣扎必败
    波华沙报英工人日报评论
    【新华社北平十二日电】波兰通讯社华沙九日电称：“华沙报”发表社论评论美政府发表的关于美国对华政策的白皮书说：这一文件强调美帝国主义者将不惜以一切代价保持他们在中国的势力。白皮书并宣称，美国反对在中国的任何“外国干涉”。当这个声明是由一个在过去几年中曾以飞机、坦克、弹药和美元送给中国的国家宣布时，它使人惊异不置。参议员范登堡补充这个文件说：他不相信共产党在中国的“侵略”是属于持久性质的。“侵略”——这就是美帝国主义者给拥有四万万五千万人民的民族的辉煌的解放所下的定义。至于所谓“持久性质的”，我们大可以回忆一下，美帝国主义者在一九一七年伟大的俄国十月革命爆发后也曾说过同样的话。那时，他们也曾从“革命不是属于持久性质的”这种想法中找寻慰藉。该报结语称：伟大的中国革命正处在完全胜利的前夕，蒋介石、耶塞普与范登堡的最后挣扎将是没有什么实际用处的。
    此外，英国工人日报发表题为“完全失败”的社论称：美国对华白皮书是美国帝国主义政策完全彻底失败的纪录。该报在引述了艾奇逊关于美国将鼓励以推翻人民民主新中国为目的的一切因素的发展的声明之后，强调指出：这是一个新的战争宣言，充满了凶狠的恫吓，并预示了新的阴谋和干涉。中国人民民主当局会懂得如何回答和对付它的。该报警告英国政府说：如果英国政府也在这个基础上活动（挑衅性的紫石英号事件和香港事件足够证明如此），那将是它的灾祸。英国只有一条路，这就是：在外交上承认新中国，并在自由和平等的基础上与新中国建立充分的贸易关系。
