    People's Bank of Beiping Branch
    Handles Currency Savings Deposits
    [This Dispatch] To meet the needs of the people and promote savings business, the People's Bank of Beiping Branch will add currency savings deposit services starting tomorrow (the 10th). The bank's savings department and all offices will begin handling it on the same day. This savings method includes two types: current and fixed. For current savings, the minimum opening deposit is 500 yuan in Renminbi (same below), with no upper limit. Deposits can be made at any time, but withdrawals can only be made once every half month (the 1st to the 15th of each month is the first half of the month, and the 16th to the end of the month is the second half). The amount of each withdrawal shall not exceed half of the current balance. The monthly interest rate is five percent, and no interest will be paid for accounts closed in less than one month.
    Fixed savings are divided into four types: lump-sum deposit and withdrawal, regular deposit and lump-sum withdrawal, lump-sum deposit and regular withdrawal, and deposit principal with interest payments. For lump-sum deposit and withdrawal, the minimum deposit amount is 1,000 yuan, with no upper limit. For regular deposit and lump-sum withdrawal, the minimum deposit amount each time is 100 yuan, with no upper limit. The deposit period is divided into four types: once every half month, once a month, once every two months, and once every three months, which depositors can choose. For lump-sum deposit and regular withdrawal, the minimum deposit amount is 6,000 yuan, with the aim of equal distribution for withdrawals. The withdrawal period is divided into four types: once every half month, once a month, once every two months, and once every three months, which depositors can choose, but once selected, it cannot be changed. For deposit principal with interest payments, the minimum deposit amount is 6,000 yuan. The principal is deposited once, and interest is collected monthly upon presentation of the passbook. For the four types of savings, the term for lump-sum deposit and withdrawal starts from three months and ends at one year. The other three types start from six months and end at one year, all in monthly units. The interest rates for these four types of savings are as follows: for lump-sum deposit and withdrawal, the interest rate is ten percent for a three-month deposit. The interest rate increases by one level (one percent is one level) for each additional month of deposit. However, to encourage long-term savings, a super-progressive method is adopted. For example, ten percent for three months, eleven percent for four months, twelve percent for five months, and fourteen percent for six months. The interest rate for the other three types of deposits is ten percent for those with a six-month deposit, and the rate increases super-progressively above six months, the same as lump-sum deposit and withdrawal. In addition, there are also provisions for early withdrawal. Depositors can withdraw early in accordance with regulations in case of marriage, funeral, illness, or official transfer. (Yu)
