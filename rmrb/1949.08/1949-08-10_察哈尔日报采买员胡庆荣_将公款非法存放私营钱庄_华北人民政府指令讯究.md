    [Ping City News] Hu Qingrong, a purchaser for the Chahar Daily, deposited a large sum of public funds into a private money shop through a private merchant, violating government decrees. He has been handed over to the court for investigation and prosecution. The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China sent personnel to the private Quan Ju Hou money shop on July 8 to understand the deposit situation. It was discovered that the money shop held a large amount of fixed-term and current deposits from the Baosheng Paper Shop of this city. Baosheng Paper Shop was established in early May and has not yet registered with the Industry and Commerce Bureau. The Beijing Branch considered this suspicious and went to the paper shop for inquiries. According to Yang Bingsheng and Wang Baochen, the persons in charge of the paper shop, this money was entrusted to the shop by the Chahar Daily to purchase newspapers, but they could not explain why the money was deposited in a private money shop. The Beijing Branch then temporarily froze the funds. On July 9, Hu Qingrong, a purchaser for the Chahar Daily, went to the Beijing Branch with a contract for purchasing paper from Baosheng Paper Shop, requesting the release of the frozen deposit. The Beijing Branch immediately ordered him to provide relevant documents and went to Baosheng Paper Shop to review the account books, discovering that the paper shop also had a portion of funds deposited in the private Hengtai money shop, transferred from the Quan Ju Hou money shop account, which the Beijing Branch also temporarily froze. After investigating the guarantor, Deji Paper Shop, it was confirmed that the paper purchase contract signed by Hu Qingrong and Baosheng Paper Shop was forged after the Beijing Branch froze the aforementioned deposits. According to Hu Qingrong, the public funds in his possession amounted to 30 million yuan. After the incident, Hu went to the Beijing Branch, strongly urging the release of the deposit with intimidating overtones. Therefore, the North China People's Government specifically instructed the Beijing Municipal People's Government on August 6 to hand over Hu Qingrong, along with Yang Bingsheng and Wang Baochen of Baosheng Paper Shop, to the court for investigation and prosecution, and notified the Chahar Daily to conduct an inspection of the matter and submit a report.

    将公款非法存放私营钱庄
    华北人民政府指令讯究
    【平市讯】察哈尔日报社采买员胡庆荣，以巨额公款经过私商存入本市私营钱庄，违犯政府法令，已交法院讯究。中国人民银行北平分行于七月八日派员至私营全聚厚钱庄了解存款情况，发现该钱庄存有本市宝生纸行之巨额定期、活期存款。宝生纸行系五月初设立，尚未呈报工商局登记，北平分行认为可疑，遂至该纸行查询，据该纸行负责人杨炳生、王宝臣称，此款系察哈尔日报社委托该行购买报纸的款项，但不能说明为何将此款存入私营钱庄，北平分行乃将该款暂予冻结。七月九日，察哈尔日报社采买员胡庆荣至北平分行，持有与宝生纸行订立购纸之合同，要求将该项冻结之存款发还，北平分行当令其提供有关各项证件，并至宝生纸行，调阅帐簿，发现该纸行另在私营恒泰钱庄亦存有一部款项，系由全聚厚钱庄帐转出者，北平分行亦即暂予冻结。经调查保证人德记纸行后，证实胡庆荣与宝生纸行所订立之购纸合同，系于北平分行冻结上述存款后所伪造者。另据胡庆荣称，他所持该项公款为三千万元。事发后胡至北平分行强词催促发还该项存款，意近恫吓。为此，华北人民政府特于八月六日指令北平市人民政府将胡庆荣连同宝生纸行杨炳生、王宝臣等三人一并交法院讯究，并通知察哈尔日报社对此事进行检查具报。
