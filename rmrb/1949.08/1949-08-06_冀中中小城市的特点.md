In order to strengthen the research on economic work in small and medium cities, and based on the reports from various places at the symposium on small and medium cities in central Hebei and the information we have learned in the past, the characteristics of small and medium cities in central Hebei are introduced as follows for reference and research in various places.

(1) Generally, small and medium cities each have one or several major industries (including handicrafts) or businesses, which drive the development of the entire city's industry and commerce. For example, Xinji's leather industry, Anguo's pharmaceutical industry, and Gaoyang's weaving and dyeing industry are all important industries that drive the development of industry and commerce. Therefore, the rise and fall of these industries will directly affect the prosperity and decline of the cities. For example, after the liberation of Tianjin, Gaoyang's cloth industry declined for a time due to the occupation of the market by some foreign cloth and foreign yarn, and due to wavering leadership and relaxed support. The amount of cloth sold at each market fell from 7,000 bolts last winter to less than 5,000 bolts for the entire month of May this year. Eight or nine out of ten weaving factories were closed. The number of dyeing workshops dropped from the original 21 to one. The number of cloth merchants and shops dropped from 98 to 76. Other industries, such as restaurants, also showed a significant decline. The number of grocery stores decreased from 42 to 25. Another example is the rapid decline in the iron industry, bamboo products, restaurants, and warehouses after the once-prosperous Botou salt market declined. However, these key industries are sometimes affected by changes in the subsidiary production in nearby rural areas and changes in regional economic conditions. Therefore, in addition to paying attention to the old foundation and habits and mastering them, we must also study new situations and not completely adhere to past understandings. Because today's economic situation is different from the past, not only is there the leadership of the state-owned economy, but there are also large cities. Therefore, we need to develop in a new direction, which is an important issue that cannot be ignored in the study of this characteristic.

(2) The main characteristic of production and trade in general small and medium cities is that they are the bridge and hub for the exchange of materials between large cities and rural areas. In addition to absorbing agricultural raw materials (such as cotton and oil) and consumer goods (such as grain, vegetables, fresh and dried fruits) from rural areas on behalf of large cities, they also promote industrial products (such as tools and daily necessities) to rural areas on behalf of large cities. The characteristic of its industrial production (or handicrafts) is reflected in the mode of production, with more scattered and backward handicraft production and very little modern mechanized production. In terms of products, on the one hand, it relies on agricultural raw materials to manufacture semi-finished products (such as cotton ginning) to supply large cities, and on the other hand, it relies on some rural raw materials and raw materials transferred from large cities to manufacture some industrial products that large cities cannot supply or replace (such as knitwear, iron and wood manufacturing, waterwheels, agricultural tools, etc.) to supply rural areas. Therefore, cities closer to large cities have a larger proportion of commerce and a greater dependence on large cities. For example, Cangzhou has 1,271 commercial households and only 366 industrial households. The city's once-developed specialty of winter vegetables mainly relies on large cities for sales and resale. Some small and medium cities farther away from large cities have a larger proportion of industry. For example, Xinji has 458 commercial households and 666 industrial households. Although the past situation of urban-rural antagonism has begun to change today, in order to better implement the principles and policies of urban-rural mutual assistance, exchange of industrial and agricultural products, and urban leadership of rural areas, this is another characteristic and law that should be deeply studied and mastered.

(3) Another characteristic of production and trade in small and medium cities is that they are highly seasonal. This is mainly due to the influence of rural production seasons and agricultural economic characteristics, which makes the production and trade of small and medium cities generally most active in spring and winter, and sluggish in summer. On the one hand, this is because the raw materials for some industrial production are agricultural products (such as cotton ginning and oil extraction); on the other hand, it is because most of the production and sales of goods are aimed at rural areas, and therefore are directly related to the farmers' busyness and leisure, as well as the farmers' economic prosperity and inadequacy. Another manifestation of seasonality is that workers and staff members engaged in operations and production have close ties with rural areas, unlike large cities, and many are linked to agricultural production. Some industries often temporarily close down during the unfavorable season in summer, and most of the workers return home to participate in production (such as cotton ginning, oil extraction, and iron and wood industries), and then return after autumn. The length of the shutdown varies depending on the operating conditions and production line (sand-casting workers take a summer break). Most of the workers have no contracts, and wages are paid by month, day, or piece. The above issues should not only be noted in leading production, but also should be studied in labor movement work.

(4) The livelihood of urban residents mainly relies on working (including full-time and part-time jobs) and small-scale sales. In areas close to major transportation lines and large cities, there is very little land, and urban residents rarely participate in farming. For example, Langfang has more than 1,770 households, but only 812 mu of land including real estate, and only more than 20 purely agricultural households. Shengfang has 6,686 households, but only more than 130 people who are engaged in agriculture year-round without operating businesses. In general, cities with more developed industry and commerce in the inland also have very little land, and farmers lack tools and technology. There are very few purely agricultural households, and most still rely on part-time or full-time peddling and working to make a living. In addition to a small portion of women participating in workshops and factories, most of the women's production is still in the nature of scattered household handicrafts (such as sewing shoe soles, sewing sock openings, and twisting thread...), and wages are generally very low. For example, in Cangzhou, a woman who sews sock openings earns only nine liang of corn a day for sewing a dozen; thread-twisting workers earn an average of only three to four jin of corn per day. In Hejian, shoe industry workers earn only six liang of rice per day for sewing soles. In addition, urban residents have very little savings, and their savings habits are poor, and their lives are very unstable. In the future development of production, how to make full use of this part of the labor force, and how to appropriately improve and solve the living problems of these women workers, is one of the important issues in urban construction work.

(5) Industrial and commercial capital is small, with few joint ventures and many sole proprietorships. This is mainly because many old industrial and commercial households collapsed or dispersed during the long-term war. In old revolutionary base area cities, most of them are newly established households during the war of resistance. Capital turnover is difficult and operations are scattered. Workshop production, mainly based on handicrafts, is still the main form, while the proportion of machinery and semi-machinery production is very small. For this kind of scattered individual production, various production industry cooperatives should be gradually organized, and their production should be supported, developed, transformed, and improved through the cooperatives, so as to gradually develop into collective production. In addition, in small and medium cities, there is more commerce than industry, more comprehensive industries, and fewer single industries. At the same time, general merchandise and general goods (department stores) can account for more than 30%, which shows that small and medium cities are mainly markets for selling industrial products from large cities.

(6) Peddlers are more numerous than shopkeepers, and at present, peddlers are generally developing. For example, in Baoding, peddlers account for more than 57% of the 8,227 industrial and commercial households. In Bozhen, there are 861 peddlers and 808 shopkeepers. This is a very abnormal situation. On the one hand, it is a deformed development during the past war period. The war has developed some scattered operations. At the same time, unstable prices have also facilitated the speculative activities of peddlers. On the other hand, it is also the result of our inadequate implementation of policies and deviations in the implementation of policies, which has also promoted the dispersion of some industries and businesses. This may be an important reason why peddlers are developing fast and still developing at present. In addition to the fact that individual merchants still have some doubts about our policy of developing industry and commerce, especially because there are some deviations in the implementation of tax policies, some larger industrial and commercial households sometimes fear paying more taxes, so they disperse and transform, and reduce their targets. This is an issue that should be studied and resolved first in our work. Because the dispersion of industrial and commercial households and their transformation from large to small is detrimental to the development of the national economy. Dispersion in commerce hinders large-scale allocation and long-distance sales, which is not conducive to the development of production. The activities of legitimate commerce have a certain effect on the development of production (of course, in the new democratic economic construction, developing industry also requires developing commerce that is conducive to the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas). For example, the production of Gaoyang cloth has been affected because private merchants have small capital and cannot purchase in large quantities to promote sales to Beiping and the Northwest. On the other hand, in industry, dispersion is not conducive to the adoption of new technologies and the use of machines to improve productivity. Similarly, the dispersion of capital is an unfavorable situation that hinders development.

    冀中中小城市的特点
    为加强中小城市经济工作的研究，根据冀中中小城市座谈会上各地的汇报材料，及过去所了解的情况，将冀中中小城市的特点作如下介绍，以供各地参考研究。
    （一）一般的中小城市，各有一种或几种主要工业（包括手工业）或商业，以此来带动整个城市工商业的发展。如辛集的皮毛业，安国的药业，高阳的织染业等，这些都是带动工商业发展的重要行业。因此这一种或几种行业的兴衰变化，也就会直接影响各该城市的繁荣与萧条。如高阳的布业，在天津解放后，由于一部洋布洋纱占领市场，及因领导思想上的摇摆而放松扶持，致使该地布业一度走向了萧条，由去冬每集上七千匹，到今年五月全月上量不及五千匹；织布工厂也十有八九停业；染坊由原有二十一户降为一户；布贩布店由九十八户，降至七十六户，其他如饭馆业也大显萧条，杂货业由四十二户减至二十五户。又如曾经盛极一时的泊头食盐市场萧条后，也直接影响到铁业、竹货及饭业、货栈等业的急剧下降。但这些重点行业，有时也受着附近农村副业生产情况与地区经济情势的变化而变化的，因此，我们除注意过去的旧有基础和习惯加以掌握外，还必须研究新的情况，不能完全固守于过去的认识，因为今天的经济情况已和过去不同，不但有国营经济的领导，并且有了大城市，所以需要我们从新方向去发展，这是研究这一特点中不能忽视的重要问题。
    （二）一般中小城市生产贸易上的特点，主要是大城市与乡村物资交流的桥梁与枢纽，它除了代替大城市吸收农村的生产原料（如棉、油）、消费资料（如粮、菜、干鲜果品等）外，并代替大城市向农村推销工业品（如工具及生活日用品）。其工业生产（或手工业）的特点，表现在生产方式上，分散落后的手工业生产多，近代化的机器生产则很少；在产品上一方面是依靠农产原料，制造半成品（如轧花等），供给大城市，一方面则依靠一些乡村原料及大城市转来原料，制造大城市所不能供给或代替的一部工业品（如针织，铁木制造、水车、农具等），供给乡村。所以距大城市近的城市商业比重大，对大城市的依附性也较大。如沧市商业一千二百七十一户，工业只有三百六十六户。该市过去曾相当发达的冬菜特产，则主要依靠大城市去销售与转销。距大城市较远的一些中小城市则工业比重为大。如辛集商业四百五十八户，工业则有六百六十六户。虽然今天已开始转变着过去城乡对立的形势，但为更好的贯彻城乡互助，工农产品交流及城市领导乡村等方针与政策，这又是应该深入研究和掌握的特点与规律。
    （三）中小城市生产贸易上的又一特点是季节性大。这主要是由于受着农村生产季节和农业经济特点的影响。使得中小城市的生产及贸易，一般是春冬为最活跃季节，夏季为萧条季节。这一方面由于有些工业生产的原料为农产品（如轧花、榨油）；另方面则由于大部生产品及商品销售以农村为对象，因而与农民生产的忙闲，以及农民经济的富裕与不足，是有直接关系的。关于季节性的另一表现，是参加经营与生产的工人及职员与农村关系密切，不同于大城市，并有很多是联系着农业生产的，有些行业在夏季不利季节，往往临时停业，工人大部回家参加生产（如轧花、榨油及铁木等业），到秋后再回来。根据经营情况及生产行别不同，其停业时间长短也不同（翻沙工人歇伏）。工人大部无约，工资有的是按月、按日、按件等。以上问题不但在领导生产上应注意，在工运工作中也是应该研究的。
    （四）市民生活主要多是依靠作工（包括整工零活）及小的贩卖。在靠近主要交通线及大城市近的地区，土地很少，市民很少参加农耕，如廊坊一千七百七十多户，连房产才有土地八百一十二亩，纯农户只二十多户。胜芳六千六百八十六户，常年业农不作经营的只一百三十余人。一般内地工商业较发展城市，土地数量亦很少，农民缺乏工具及技术，纯农户也很少，主要还是依靠兼营或专营小贩及作工来生活。妇女生产除很少一部参加到作坊工厂工作外，大部还是分散的家庭手工业性质（如纳鞋底、缝袜口、捣线……），一般工资很低。如沧市缝袜口女工一天缝一打，才得九两玉米的工资；捣线工人每天平均不过玉米三斤至四斤。河间鞋业工人，纳底每天才得工资米六两。另外市民很少积蓄，其积蓄习惯也差，生活动荡性很大。今后在发展生产中，如何充分使用起这部分劳动力，以及如何适当改善与解决这些妇女工人的生活问题，是城市建设工作中的重要问题之一。
    （五）工商业资金较小，合资的少，独资经营的多。这主要由于在长期战争中不少的旧有工商户垮台或分散。在老区城市中大部为抗战中的新生户，资金周转困难，经营分散，其中以手工业为主的作坊生产还是主要的，机器及半机器生产比重则很小，对这种分散个体的生产，应逐渐发动组织各种生产行业的合作社，经过合作社扶植发展和改造提高其生产，以便逐步发展为集体生产。另外在中小城市中，商业多于工业，综合行业多，单一行业少，同时一般杂货、广货（百货业）能占百分之三十以上，这说明中小城市主要还是推销大城市工业品的市场。
    （六）行商摊贩多于座商，且目前行商摊贩一般还是发展的现象，如保定工商业共八千二百二十七户，行商摊贩即占百分之五十七以上；泊镇行摊八百六十一户，座商则为八百零八户；这是一种极不正当的形势，一方面是过去战争期间的畸形发展，战争发展了一些分散的经营；同时物价不稳，也便利了行商的投机活动；另方面则由于我们在贯彻政策上不够与执行政策上偏差的结果，也促成某些工商业的分散，这或者是行商摊贩发展快与目前还在发展的重要原因。除了因为个别商人还对我发展工商业政策有些怀疑外；特别因为在税收政策执行上有某些偏差，一些较大的工商业户，有时怕多纳税，则分散转化，缩小目标，这是应该从工作中首先研究与解决的问题。因为工商业户的分散，化整为零，对发展国民经济是不利的；在商业上分散则妨害大宗调剂与远途运销，对发展生产不利。正当的商业的活动，对生产的发展是有一定作用的（当然在新民主主义经济建设中，发展工业，同时也需要发展有利于城乡物资交流的商业的）。如高阳布的生产，即由于私商资金小，不能大宗收购向北平和西北推销而受到影响，另一方面在工业上，分散则不利于采用新技术与使用机器提高生产力，同样资金分散是阻碍发展的不利形势。
