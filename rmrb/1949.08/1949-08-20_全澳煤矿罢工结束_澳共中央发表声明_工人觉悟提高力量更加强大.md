    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th: TASS, Sydney: Following the end of the seven-week general strike by Australian coal miners on August 15th, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Australia issued a statement pointing out that although the economic demands of the miners have not yet been met, the miners and the majority of Australian workers have understood that in the struggle between workers and capitalists, the Labor Party government and the right-wing Labor Party leaders are colluding with the capitalists to attack the workers. As the economic crisis deepens, monopoly capitalists are trying to shift all the misfortunes and sufferings of the new depression onto the working people. Therefore, it is crucial for workers to be able to distinguish between true friends and false friends. The strike proved that the Communist Party is the true friend of the coal miners and the heroic leader of the Australian working people. Everywhere, Communists are always at the forefront of the struggle, and the Communist Party newspapers are ardent supporters of the demands of the coal miners. The aim of the capitalists and the government was to eliminate the Communist Party and the Coal Miners' Union Federation. But they failed to achieve either of these goals. The Communist Party of Australia has become stronger than before in this struggle.

　　全澳煤矿罢工结束
  　澳共中央发表声明
    工人觉悟提高力量更加强大
    【新华社北平十九日电】塔斯社悉尼讯：澳大利亚煤矿工人七周总罢工在八月十五日结束以后，澳大利亚共产党中央委员会发表声明指出，虽然矿工的经济要求尚未满足，矿工与澳大利亚大部分工人已懂得，在工人与资本家的斗争中，工党政府和工党右翼领导当局是与资本家合力向工人进攻的。由于经济危机的日益加深，垄断资本家正在力图把新的萧条的一切不幸及痛苦都转嫁给劳动人民，因此，工人必须能够辨别真朋友与假朋友，这是非常重要的。罢工证明了共产党是煤矿工人真正的朋友，是澳大利亚劳动人民的英勇领袖。在任何地方，共产党人总是在斗争的前列，共产党报纸是煤矿工人要求的热烈拥护者。资本家与政府的目的是在消灭共产党和煤矿工人工会联合会。但是这两个目的他们都没有达到。澳大利亚共产党在这次斗争中变得比以前更强大了。
