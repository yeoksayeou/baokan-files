    Chahar Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative
    Will Support Down and Feather Industries
    [Chahar News] The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative plans to support down and feather and other handicraft industries in the second half of the year. Zhangjiakou has signed a contract with Tianjin to spin coarse woolen yarn in Zhangjiakou to supply Tianjin for carpet weaving. Areas with a foundation in wool spinning, such as Xuanhua, Datong, and Zhangbei, are all planning to gradually organize and develop this industry. Chahar Province has a large foundation in felt hat production. Before the incident, Xuanhua alone could produce 500,000 hats annually, which were sold in North China and Northeast China. At present, this kind of item is still extremely needed in the vast rural areas, and it cannot be replaced by large-scale industry in the short term. It should also be planned to organize and support it. This year, Xuanhua has successively resumed work with the help of the People's Government, and 200,000 hats can be produced by the end of the year. The copperware manufacturing and sieve bottom industries in Hunyuan, Yanbei, are also planned to be studied for support and development.
