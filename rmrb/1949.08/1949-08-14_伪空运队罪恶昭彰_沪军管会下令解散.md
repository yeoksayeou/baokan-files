    The Notorious Pseudo Air Transport Team
    Dissolved by Order of the Shanghai Military Control Commission
    [Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station, 13th] The Shanghai Military Control Commission has ordered the dissolution of the organization of the Air Transport Team directly under the Pseudo Ministry of Communications' Civil Aviation Administration. The predecessor of this air transport team was the Air Transport Brigade of the Pseudo Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, also known as the Chennault Air Transport Team. During the War of Liberation, this air transport team frequently bombed the people of our liberated areas and carried out airdrops to the bandit troops surrounded by our army, committing heinous crimes.

    伪空运队罪恶昭彰
    沪军管会下令解散
    【上海人民广播电台十三日广播】上海市军管会已下令解散伪交通部民运航空局直辖空运队的组织。这个空运队的前身，就是伪行政院善后救济总署空运大队，也就是所谓陈纳德空运队。这个空运队，在解放战争中，经常地轰炸我解放区人民，和被我军包围的匪军实施空投，罪恶昭彰。
