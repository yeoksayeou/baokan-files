    Reading and Work
    Niu Jiaxin
    Part Two:
    But books still must be read, and read well, because learning is the most important thing. Without learning, we cannot work; without learning well, it is difficult to do our work well. However, this does not mean that learning precludes work, or that one can only read well, only "pursue advanced studies," if one does not work. But just in terms of reading, how can one truly read well, or truly benefit from reading to help oneself work better? I think the first thing is not to be divorced from work practice, and the second is to read purposefully and with a plan, without being arrogant or impetuous, and without reaching for the sky.
    Generally speaking, there are many kinds of books. So, we should classify books according to the nature of our work and business, and read them with different priorities and sequences. In my work, I roughly classify books into three categories:
    First: These are the must-read, central books, such as Party documents, policy instructions, and revolutionary theories. The method of reading is to read carefully, take notes, and reflect in connection with reality. I believe that reading these books is to improve one's own political and theoretical level.
    Second: These are business-related, specialized books, such as economics, literature, and philosophy; these are read step by step according to individual work nature and interests.
    Third: These are reference books and tool books, used as auxiliary materials for the central books, and only need to be browsed and consulted frequently. For example, when reading the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, there are some material books to refer to.
    In addition, I think that in order to achieve planned, step-by-step, and systematic reading and learning, we must also overcome our "reaching for the sky" mentality and truly achieve "not being arrogant or impetuous." As the ancients said, "Haste makes waste," and this point is also very important. Often some young people are like this: they can't wait to swallow a library in one gulp, but little do they know that this is impossible.
    Another point is that reading should overcome the method of "reading behind closed doors," and should often exchange opinions with comrades to inspire oneself and help others, without being divorced from the collective, without being divorced from reality. Only by holding a spirit of "tireless learning and tireless teaching" can we truly read well, truly "pursue advanced studies," and truly benefit the cause of the people.

    之二：
    但书还一定是要读的，而且还要好好地读，因为学习是最重要的，不学习，便无法工作，学习不好，便难于把工作做得好。只是这不等于说要学习便不能工作，或者说只有不工作才能把书读好，才能“深造”。可是仅就读书来说，怎样才能真正地把书读得好，或真正由于读书得益而帮助自己更好地工作呢？我想首先是不脱离工作实践，其次便是有目的地，有计划地读，不骄不躁，不好高鹜远。
    书，一般的说也是种类繁多的。所以说我们最好能根据自己的工作，业务的性质，把书分成类，有轻有重，有先有后地去读。我在工作中读书学习大约把书别为三类：
    第一：是必读的，中心的书，如党的文件、政策指示、革命理论等。读的方法是精读，写笔记，联系实际做反省。我认为读这些书是为了提高自己的政治理论水平。
    第二：是业务的，专门的书，如经济、文学、哲学等；则是根据个人不同的工作性质和爱好，来有步骤地读。
    第三：是工具书，参考书，作为中心书的辅助用的，只须经常浏览翻阅。如看联共党史罢，就有一些材料书要参考的。
    另外我觉得，要作到有计划的有步骤的有系统的读书学习，还必须克服掉自己的“好高鹜远”思想，真的做到“不骄不躁”。古人说过：“欲速则不达”，这一点也是很重要的。往往有些青年是这样：恨不得一口吞掉一个图书馆，殊不知这那里可能。
    再一点便是读书要克服“关上门自己读”的办法，应当经常地和同志们交换意见，从中启发自己，帮助旁人，不要脱离集体，不要脱离实际。惟有这样地怀着一种“学而不厌，诲人不倦”的精神，我想才真的能够把书读得好，才真能“深造”，才真能有益于人民的事业。
