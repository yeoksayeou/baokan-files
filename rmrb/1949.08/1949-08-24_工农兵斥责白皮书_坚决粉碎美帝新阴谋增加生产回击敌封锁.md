　　Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Denounce the White Paper
  　Resolutely Crush the New American Imperialist Conspiracy; Increase Production to Counter Enemy Blockade
    [Report from this newspaper] The release of the American imperialist White Paper has provoked unanimous anger and condemnation from workers in Beijing, farmers in the suburbs, and People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers garrisoning Beijing. Wu Xijun, a loading and unloading worker at Beijing East Station, said: "American imperialism has been an enemy of the Chinese people from beginning to end. Its plan to invade China has failed, and now it is completely embarrassed and has to confess its crimes." Wu Guocheng, a political instructor of a certain company in a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army garrisoning Beijing, said: "Today, it is impossible for American imperialism to deny its aggression against the Chinese people. The Chinese people and the people of the world can see very clearly, and our People's Liberation Army sees it even more clearly: it was American-made munitions that slaughtered the Chinese people, and it was American-made weapons that were seized from the hands of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang; and we have personally captured American troops and military personnel who participated in the war. But the American imperialist policy of aiding the bandits has shamefully failed."
    Workers, peasants, and soldiers unanimously pointed out the new conspiracy of American imperialism to continue its aggression against China. Wang Guorui, chairman of the Farmers' Association of Guandongdian Village in the 13th District of the suburbs, said: "Its idea (referring to the publication of the White Paper) is still to treat us as beasts of burden." Yan Zhonghao of the First Electrical Machinery Repair Factory said: "What we need to pay attention to is that the White Paper wants to exploit loopholes, attempting to support so-called 'democratic individualists' and divide the democratic camp. We must expose its tricks." Soldier Qi Jingchun said: "In the White Paper, American imperialism shamelessly attempts to slander the people of China and the Soviet Union, and to slander the Chinese Communist Party and the Soviet Union, but the American imperialist conspiracy is bound to fail. Today, not only are the Chinese people close to the Soviet Union, but also all peace-loving and freedom-loving people around the world, including the American people, are also close to the Soviet Union. The Chinese people and the Soviet people were friendly in the past, are friendly now, and will be even more friendly in the future. We can tell American imperialism this."
    When talking about the enemy's blockade, Yi Chengxun and Li Shiqi, workers at the East Water Plant of the Beijing Waterworks Company, said: "The blockade will definitely bring us some temporary difficulties, but the Chinese working class is diligent and enduring. We have plenty of creativity. In the past, we were suppressed by the reactionaries. Since liberation, our creative enthusiasm is being fully unleashed. The successive creation of parts and the improvement of tools are proof of this. The more the enemy blockades us, the more we will work hard to create, and use increased production to counter the enemy's blockade." The director of the Balizhuang Farmers' Association in the 13th District said with confidence: "If American imperialism blockades the Chinese coast, our farmers will produce more, grow more grain, and produce more industrial raw materials, so we won't rely on imperialism." Chen Buxiang of the Postal Remittance Bureau said: "No matter how American imperialism blockades us, no matter how long it blockades us, our Party and the Chinese people have been tested. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region was blockaded for a long time, and the conditions were much more difficult than they are now, but we finally won! Tell American imperialism that the Chinese people have the confidence to overcome all difficulties."
    In addition to increasing production, workers, peasants, and soldiers unanimously stated that they would also work hard with the government to continue to eliminate the remaining counter-revolutionaries and practice strict economy to build a new China for the people. For example, Hu Tong, a telephone operator at the Telecommunications Bureau, and Gu Shide, of the Line Engineering Brigade, said: "American imperialism, seeing that its foundation in China - the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang - is about to be eliminated, is trying to engage in some kind of fifth column. We must be vigilant and resolutely eliminate it." Chen Jinrong, a worker at the Beijing Transportation Company, said: "Thrift is an important matter in our construction work. We should start saving from the materials we lack, such as gasoline, which we should try to save as much as possible. We must turn thrift into a mass movement." The peasants in the suburbs unanimously expressed their willingness to assist the government in eliminating feudal forces in the countryside and doing a good job in land reform. The soldiers of a certain PLA unit unanimously expressed their determination to eliminate more enemies at the front and to ensure the safety of the people by guarding the rear. No matter what new conspiracy American imperialism has, the Chinese people have the power to crush it.

### 工农兵斥责白皮书　坚决粉碎美帝新阴谋增加生产回击敌封锁

　　工农兵斥责白皮书
  　坚决粉碎美帝新阴谋增加生产回击敌封锁
    【本报讯】美帝发表白皮书以后，引起了北平市工人、市郊农民和卫戍北平的解放军指战员们一致的愤怒与谴责。北平东站装卸工人吴锡浚说：美帝自始至终与中国人民为敌，它的侵华计划失败了，这次窘态毕露，不得不供出罪行。卫戍北平的人民解放军某部某连指导员吴国成说：今天美帝想不承认侵略中国人民也不可能了，中国人民与全世界人民看得很清楚，我们解放军看得更清楚：屠杀中国人民的是美制军火，从蒋介石匪帮手里夺过来的是美造武器；并且还亲手俘虏过美帝参战的军队与军事人员，但是美帝的援匪政策可耻的失败了。
    工、农、战士们一致指出美帝继续侵华的新阴谋。郊十三区关东店村农会主任王国瑞说：“它那个主意（指发表白皮书）就是还想拿咱当牛马。”第一电机修配厂严钟豪说：要注意的是白皮书想钻空子，企图扶植所谓“民主个人主义”者，分化民主阵营，我们一定要揭穿它的鬼把戏。战士齐景春说：美帝在白皮书中穷极无耻地企图污蔑中苏两国人民，污蔑中国共产党和苏联，但是美帝的阴谋必然失败，今天不但中国人民与苏联靠拢，全世界爱好和平与自由的人民，连美国人民在内，也都在与苏联靠拢；中国人民和苏联人民过去友好，现在友好，今后还要更友好，这点我们可以正告美帝。
    在谈到敌人的封锁问题时，北平自来水公司东水厂工人伊承勋、李士琦说：封锁一定会带给我们一些暂时的困难，但是中国工人阶级是勤劳耐苦的，我们有的是创造能力，过去它被反动派压制着，解放以后，我们的创造热情正在充分发挥，接二连三的创造机件、改良工具就是明证；敌人越封锁，我们就越使劲创造，用增加生产来回击敌人的封锁。十三区八里庄农会主任充满自信的说：美帝封锁中国海岸，咱们农民就多生产，多打粮食，多生产工业原料，就是不依赖帝国主义。邮汇局陈步湘说：无论美帝怎样封锁，无论它封锁多少时候，我们的党和中国人民是受过考验的，陕甘宁边区曾被长期封锁，条件比现在不知艰难多少倍，但是我们终于胜利了！告诉美帝，中国人民有信心克服一切困难。
    除了增加生产，工、农、战士们一致表示，还要努力和政府协力继续肃清反革命残余，厉行节约来建设人民的新中国。如电信局话务员胡桐、线路工程大队谷世德等说：美帝眼看着自己在华的根基——蒋介石匪帮即将被消灭，企图搞什么第五纵队，我们要提高警惕，坚决予以肃清。北平运输公司工人陈锦荣说：节约是我们建设工作中的重要事体，我们先从自己缺乏的物资节约起，譬如汽油，我们就要尽量节省用；要把节约造成一个群众性运动。郊区农民一致表示协助政府肃清农村封建势力，做好土地改革工作。某部解放军战士们一致表示在前方要多多消灭敌人，在后方警卫要确保人民的安全。不管美帝要什么新阴谋，中国人民有力量粉碎它。
