Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 10th—The deadline for registering export merchants with the East China Foreign Trade Administration was the end of July. Over 2,900 applications were received, and business licenses have been issued to 630 importers and 727 exporters. The Administration has now obtained the consent of the North China Foreign Trade Administration, and export merchants holding business licenses issued by the East China Foreign Trade Administration can purchase local products in various parts of North China and ship them for export from nearby northern ports, but foreign exchange settlement must be handled in Tianjin.

[Report from this newspaper, Shanghai]: News from Shanghai: Shanghai import and export merchants, Lun Kang Trading Company, and Meilun Import and Export Company, have requested permission from the Foreign Trade Administration to engage in import and export trade in North China ports. The Administration has consulted with the North China Industry and Commerce Department and the Railway Department, and has agreed to provide them with various conveniences. At the same time, He'an, Da Mao, and other companies have also sent representatives to Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Zhejiang, and other places to investigate and purchase materials, so that the stagnant import and export trade can be developed.
