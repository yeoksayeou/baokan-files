Electricity Thief Li Yaozong
Caught on First Day of Census

[Report from this newspaper] In response to the anti-electricity theft campaign launched by the Beijing Branch of the North China Electric Power Company, city-wide inspections began on the 8th. Seventy-five teams were mobilized throughout the city to conduct household-by-household investigations. On the first day, Li Yaozong, an electricity thief using an electric furnace with a separately installed ground wire, was caught at No. 2 Qianyizihu Hutong, Inner District 1. At the time of the arrest, Li claimed to be the manager of the Tongle Cinema. He was arrogant and made things difficult for the inspectors, refusing to admit his theft. However, after careful searching by inspectors Fu Jinzhang and Guan Deli, and Comrade Bian Quanfu from the local Public Security Bureau, the stolen electricity junction box, ground wire, and a 2-kilowatt electric furnace were discovered. He has now been handed over to the Electric Power Company authorities for legal processing.
