    Arrives in Shanghai One After Another
    Prices Generally Tend to Fall
    Northern Anhui Exchanges for Large Quantities of Industrial Products for the Second Time
    [Shanghai News] As transportation in various regions gradually recovers and smooths, the exchange of goods gradually expands and unfolds, and improvements in market supply and demand relationships and transactions have become favorable factors for stabilizing market finance and prices. Therefore, in the two months since liberation, Shanghai's prices initially rose gradually and slightly, and then entered a stable phase. Recently, due to the increasing supply of goods from various regions and the arrival of new grains on the market, prices have been prompted to shift from stability to decline. On the 3rd of this month, various major necessities for people's livelihood continued to fall, falling even more than the previous two days. Following the arrival of new Zhoupu japonica rice on the 2nd, new rice from Jinhua and Lanxi areas of Western Zhejiang was also transported in on the 3rd, and new Pudong japonica rice was continuously transported in, forming a situation of supply exceeding demand in the market; and prices in the producing areas were also reported. It is reported that on the 3rd, the price of top-quality white rice in Wuxi was only 38,700 yuan, second-quality japonica rice was 31,500 yuan, the price of flour was 6,600 yuan per bag, Suzhou medium-quality white rice was 39,000 yuan, flour was 7,150 yuan, wheat was 15,500 yuan, soybeans were 27,000 yuan, and soybean cake was 10,000 yuan.
    [Further News] The 43 civilian boats carrying 5 million tons of grain from Northern Anhui arrived in Shanghai on the 1st of this month and finished unloading on the 3rd. The batch of grain has been allocated by the Municipal Trade Corporation to the Grain Company to supply the market. This batch of grain includes more than 1 million catties of rice and nearly 90,000 catties of soybeans. After the Northern Anhui Trade Corporation transported this batch of grain, it exchanged it for industrial products from Shanghai.
