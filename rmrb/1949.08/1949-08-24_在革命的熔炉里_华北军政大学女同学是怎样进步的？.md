　　In the Crucible of Revolution
　　——How Did Female Students of North China Military and Political University Progress?
　　Kang Yuebo, Sun Fangjuan, Shi Zhiben, Lu Jian
　　We have progressed!
　　The great victory of the People's Liberation War rescued us from the dark old society, liberated us from our narrow life circles, and threw us into the embrace of the people. We feel incomparably honored and fortunate.
　　The strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army after entering Beiping City, and the people's cheers it evoked, made us feel that being a soldier of the people was supremely glorious. Therefore, when we saw the recruitment advertisement for North China Military and Political University, we excitedly volunteered to register. Now, we have been in school for three months, and we have studied the history of social development, the history of the Chinese Communist Party, and the nature of the Chinese revolution, as well as reports from the leaders. Many cadres have enthusiastically guided us, enabling us to initially acquire revolutionary knowledge and overcome many concerns and vague ideas. Every student feels that they have made some progress; indeed, we feel that the big family of Military and Political University is very lovable, the male students are progressing so quickly; and we are indeed progressing!
　　It's imperative to study at Military and Political University!
　　One of us, a fourteen-year-old girl named Yang Xiangpu, was admitted to the university on March 20th because she admired the glory of the People's Liberation Army. But suddenly, on the 25th, her mother tried every possible way to call her home. In such a situation, what should Yang Xiangpu do? She remained determined to stay in Military and Political University, but her mother was adamant against it, saying, "Good iron isn't used to make nails, good men don't become soldiers; a woman, what business does she have being a soldier, isn't this utterly absurd?" Yang Xiangpu insisted repeatedly, which resulted in her mother's rebuke and beatings, and finally she was tricked away. After returning home, she was confined to a small room like a prisoner, and she thought every possible way to break free, especially when she thought of the school cadres' kindness and warmth towards her, and the students' help and care for her, which increased her courage to resist her family. She patiently explained and persuaded her family many times, and after many struggles, she finally returned to school on April 8th.
　　"It's imperative to study at Military and Political University!" This courageous spirit of little comrade Yang Xiangpu, this love for the revolutionary army, and the will to dedicate herself to national defense construction, has moved many students!
　　Intense regularization
　　We have not only made progress in our studies, but our lives are also very regularized! Look! As soon as the morning wake-up call sounds, every student runs nervously to line up. At the platoon leader's command of "Attention," the team immediately stands quietly and neatly. Once, one student impatiently whispered, "It's good, but I'm afraid we can't keep it up forever." The students glanced at her and retorted, "Who says so? We can definitely maintain it!"
　　Yes, that's the truth, have it your way! No matter which class's dormitory you walk into, the first thing you see is the blankets folded into square little boxes neatly arranged on the beds, and the lunch bags and newly issued large straw hats hanging on the wall, which is truly simple yet beautiful. The happiest thing is that we have learned a skill: to avoid mosquitoes and flies, we personally made reed curtains and hung them on the doors; the students enjoy the fruits of their first labor and feel very happy.
　　Digging air-raid shelters
　　The higher authorities have called for the digging of air-raid shelters, and everyone is enthusiastically responding. The students brave the hot sun, carrying hoes and shovels in groups of three or five, striding vigorously towards the field. At their assigned location, they take off their tops, roll up their trouser legs, and some students tie a white towel around their heads, looking from afar like a group of working farmers.
　　The students in each class are vying to dig, using washbasins to carry the soil out due to the shortage of tools; sweat mixed with loess streams down their faces. One of the students, named Kang Yuebo, said skeptically, "It's a waste of energy digging, sweating so much, what's the point? I dare say that the Kuomintang can't even find a way to escape, how could there be planes coming here to bomb us!…" Comrade Sun Fangjuan said, "We prepare for the unexpected; if one day they do come, this is called being prepared for a rainy day. Moreover, the main thing is to exercise and strengthen our labor perspective, and transform our old consciousness of 'getting something for nothing'!"
　　Visiting a yarn factory
　　In order to combine learning with practice, we went to visit a yarn factory. As soon as we entered the machine room, some students felt a little dizzy. We slowly lined up and watched in order, spinning, weaving… we watched everything one by one before walking out of the machine room. Many students breathed a sigh of relief, meaning, "This room is really suffocating."
　　But then we saw the male and female workers who work diligently in this hot room for eight hours a day, their faces covered with sweat and cotton fluff, were so busy, enthusiastic, and happy, spinning piles of snow-white cotton into thread, and then weaving the thread into cloth. When the students thought of such scenes, they deeply realized the great significance of the working people creating everything.
　　One student said, "Before, I only knew to wear good cloth, and never thought that weaving a piece of cloth would require so many procedures; and so many workers to carry out labor! In the future, I must save a little on wearing clothes, and can't waste them anymore."
　　At the coking plant
　　At the coking plant, we stood on the coke pile, looking at the coking furnace across from us, and the person in charge of the plant explained to us the device of the coking furnace, its usage, the uses of the products, and so on.
　　Next to the hot coking furnace, workers covered in sweat were working diligently. When the coke was discharged from the furnace, the flames were raging, and several bare-backed workers rushed forward to pour water, with water vapor shooting in all directions. Everyone watched this solemn and majestic scene with rapt attention.
　　At that time, the brigade leader said to us, "Can you do this? The greatness of the workers lies here." Indeed, we cannot, not only can we not do this, but even standing next to the furnace for a while would be a problem; because we were standing far away on the coal pile and already felt roasted enough.
　　Therefore, after this visit to the factory in conjunction with our studies, we more clearly recognized the admirable and lovable work spirit of the working class, and made each of us feel the shame of being an exploitative parasite. The worker representative sincerely said to us: I hope that we will intensify our studies, and are willing to join hands with us to jointly shoulder the glorious task of liberating the people of the whole country and building a new China. Yes, we will never forget the scenes next to the spinning machine and the coking furnace, nor will we forget the speeches of the worker representatives, we must live up to the expectations of the worker comrades, and we must learn from the great working class.
　　Pulling wheat
　　The wheat in the fields is ripe, and the whole team, except for two sick people, worked together to help the villagers pull wheat; this is the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army, and it is also an exercise of our labor concept.
　　Under the hot May sun, a group of new Chinese young women, skipping and laughing, poured into the boundless golden wheat fields – and started pulling wheat!
　　Most of the students grew up in the city, and eat white flour every day, but they have never seen what wheat looks like. They were even more clueless about how wheat grows, how it grows, and how it is harvested. Now that they have arrived in the embrace of the working people, every student is doing their best, which is something they have never done before. "Everyone must work hard! Everyone must work hard! We must actively help the villagers in production." Loud singing sounded, and everyone competed to be the first, bending over, sweating, pulling forward row by row! Shouts of encouragement and challenges could be heard from every corner at any time. The singing stopped, the wheat was pulled, but a student named Zhang Wenxu started crying. When everyone asked the reason, they learned that she was crying because she was pulling too slowly.
　　The sun set, and everyone piled the pulled wheat into bundles one by one; at this time, almost every student had blisters on their hands, and their arms were pricked with small red bumps by wheat awns; but no one paid attention to this, and continued to pull happily until it was dark. This practical education was also very significant for the students, and everyone not only recognized the hard work of the working people in theory, but also more deeply realized the greatness of labor in the actual wheat pulling.
　　Extracurricular activities
　　"Clang! Clang! Qi clang qi…" The gongs and drums sounded, and the students, in groups of three or five, twisted happily towards the large playground. After a while, they formed a large circle; twisting and singing the song they composed: "Study hard, serve the people well, study with a humble attitude, leaders and cadres put their hearts into it! If you don't work hard, you'll let the people down, ya hu hei hei yi hu ya hu hei"… The lively and cheerful atmosphere of the revolutionary big family enveloped everyone's hearts, and we are so happy to be able to study and live in such an environment! The students all said, "We must intensify our studies and transform ourselves in the future!" The students who were originally skeptical about the Military and Political University, a little afraid of the hardship of being a soldier, and felt that it might be too unfree, couldn't help but laugh and joke, saying, "I used to be afraid of being laughed at for being a female soldier, but today I feel that the Military and Political University is an amazing university and a big family; it not only transforms you so patiently, but also makes you feel very warm and enthusiastic; if my mother writes to me again and asks me to go back, I will correct her backward mind."

　　在革命的熔炉里
    ——华北军政大学女同学是怎样进步的？
    康月波　孙芳娟　史之本　鲁健
    我们进步了！
    人民解放战争的伟大胜利，把我们从黑暗的旧社会里拯救出来，使我们脱离了狭小的生活圈子，投入到人民的怀抱里。我们感到无比光荣、幸运。
    由于解放军入北平城后，纪律严明，人民欢声载道的影响，使我们感到作一个人民的战士是无尚光荣的，所以当我们看到华北军大招生的广告后，我们便兴奋地自动报了名。现在，我们入学已经有三个月的时间了，我们学习了社会发展史，中国共产党的历史和中国革命的性质，以及首长们的报告等。许多干部热心的指导我们，使我们已经初步的获得了革命知识，克服了很多顾虑和模糊思想。每个同学都感到自己有些进步；的确，我们感到军大这个大家庭很可爱，男同学们是那么飞快的进步着；而我们也确实是进步了！
    非到军大学习不可！
    我们中有一个十四岁的女同学，她叫杨香蒲；因羡慕人民解放军的光荣，三月二十日就考入了军大。但，突然的在二十五日，她的母亲，想尽许多办法把她叫回家。在这样一个情况下，杨香蒲怎么办呢？她仍坚决要在军大，她母亲却坚决不让，并说：“好铁不打钉，好男不当兵；一个妇道人家，还要当什么兵，这不是太岂有此理了吗？”杨香蒲坚持再三，结果遭到了她母亲的责备和打骂，终于把她骗走了。回家后她象囚犯似的被关在一间小屋子里，她百般的想着挣脱，尤其当她想到学校干部们对她的亲切热情，同学们对她的帮助爱护的情景的时候，便愈增加她对家庭反抗的勇气。她向家庭进行了多次耐心的解释和说服，经过许多斗争，在四月八号终于又回学校来了。
    “非到军大学习不可”！杨香蒲小同学这种果敢的精神，这种对革命军队热爱，愿献身于国防建设的意志，曾感动了许多同学！
    紧张的正规化
    我们不但学习上有了进步，生活上也是很正规化的！看吧！早晨起床号一响，每个同学便紧张跑着去站队。区队长一声“立正”，便立刻静悄悄地很整齐的把队站好了。有一次一个同学沉不住气的低声说：“好是好，就怕不能永远的这样下去。”同学们对她看了一眼，反驳说：“谁说的，我们绝对能保持下去！”
    是的，这是老实话，随你意吧！不管走进哪班的宿舍，一进门首先就看见叠的象小盒子一样方的被子整齐的排列在床上，墙上挂着一挂一挂的饭包和新发的大草帽，真是朴素而又美观。最高兴的事情是我们学会了一件本事，为了避免蚊蝇，我们亲手用苇子打成帘子挂在门上；同学们享受着自己第一次劳动的果实，都感到非常愉快。
    挖防空洞
    上级号召挖防空洞了，大家都热烈的响应着。同学们冒着火热的太阳，三五成群的扛着锄头、铁铣，健旺的迈着大步向野外走。都在自己分配的地点，脱了上衣，卷起裤角，有的同学头上扎着一条白手巾，远远看去，真象是一群劳动的农民。
    每班的同学，都是抢着挖，工具少用脸盆装土向外倒；汗掺着黄土，往下直流。同学中有一个叫康月波的，很怀疑的说：“费牛劲挖，流这多汗，其实，有什么用呢？我敢说，国民党连逃跑的道都找不到了，还哪里有飞机来到这里炸我们！…”。孙芳娟同学说：“我们不怕一万，但防万一；若偏偏一朝来了，这就叫有备无患。而且，主要的也是锻炼锻炼身体，加强咱们的劳动观点，改造咱们‘不劳而获’的旧意识！”
    参观纱厂
    为了学习与实际结合，我们到纱厂去参观。一进机器房，有的同学便感觉有些头晕。我们缓步的排着队伍，按次序的看着，纺纱、织布……一样一样的都看过了，才走出机器房。很多同学都出了一口气，意思是说：“这屋里真闷死人了。”
    但又一看，这整天在这闷热的房子里一天埋头工作八小时的男女工人，他们的脸上挂满了汗珠，粘满了棉花毛，竟是那么紧张、热烈、愉快，把一堆堆洁白如雪的棉花纺成线，又把线织成布。同学们想到这样的场面时，对劳动工人创造一切的伟大意义就深刻的体会到了。
    一个同学说：“以前我只知道穿好布，根本没有想到织成一匹布还要经过那么多手续；需要那么多工人来进行劳动！今后我穿衣服一定要节省一点了，可不能再浪费了。”
    在炼焦厂
    在炼焦厂，我们站在焦炭堆上，望着对面的炼焦炉，厂内负责人给我们讲解着炼焦炉的装置，使用法，产物的用途等等。
    高热的炼焦炉旁，满身大汗的工人，紧张的工作着。焦炭出炉时，烈火熊熊，几个赤背的工人火急的奔向前去浇水，水蒸气喷射四方。这幅庄严雄伟的景象，大家看得出神了。
    当时大队首长对我们说：“你们能这样吗？工人的伟大就在这里。”的确，我们不能，我们不但不能这样作，甚至在炉旁边站一会也成问题；因为我们站在炭堆上远远的看，就已经觉得烤的够难受了。
    所以从这次配合学习，参观工厂后，使我们更明确的认识了工人阶级可敬可爱的劳动精神，并使我们每一个人都感到了剥削寄生者的可耻。工人代表诚挚地向我们说：希望我们加紧学习，愿和我们携起手来，共同担负起解放全国人民和建设新中国的光荣任务。是的，我们忘不了纺纱车和炼焦炉旁的景象，忘不了工人代表同志们的讲话，我们要不辜负工人同志们的热望，我们要向伟大的工人阶级学习。
    拔麦子
    地里的麦子熟了，全队除了两个病号外，一齐动手去帮助老乡拔麦子；这是人民解放军的光荣传统，对我们劳动观念也是个锻炼。
    五月的炎热的太阳照着，一群新中国的女青年们，蹦蹦跳跳，又谈又笑的涌进了一望无际的金黄色的麦浪里——开始拔麦了！
    大多数的同学都生长在城市里，天天吃着白面，可是他们没有见过麦子是啥样。关于麦子怎么生，怎么长，怎么收割，更莫明其妙了。现在到了劳动人民的怀抱里了，每一个同学都尽了最大的努力去做，这是有生以来从没做过的事情呵。“大家要努力！大家要努力！帮助老乡生产一定要积极。”嘹亮的歌声响着，大家争先恐后的，弯着腰，流着汗，一行一行的向前拔！互相鼓励着，进行挑战的喊叫声真是随时都可从各个角落里听到。歌声停止了，麦子拔完了，但有一个叫张文煦的同学哭起来了。大家问明原因，才知道她是因为拔的慢而急哭了。
    太阳落山了，大家又把拔了的麦子一捆一捆的堆起来；这时差不多每个同学手上都打了泡，胳膊被麦芒扎起小红疙疸；可是谁都不理这，仍旧高兴地拔着，直到天黑。这次给同学们的实际教育也是很大的，大家不仅在道理上认识了劳动人民的辛勤，并在实际拔麦中更深刻的体会了劳动是伟大的。
    课外活动
    “锵！锵！齐锵齐……”锣鼓响了，同学们三五成群笑嘻嘻的扭着往大操场走。一会儿，围成了一个大圈子；一边扭，一边唱着自己编的歌：“努力学习，为人民好服务，学习要抱虚心的态度，首长干部用尽心哪！再不努力对不起人民，呀呼嘿嘿依呼呀呼嘿”……革命大家庭的活泼愉快的气氛笼罩着每个人的心，我们能在这样的环境下学习、生活，真是高兴极了！同学们都这样说：“我们以后可要加紧学习，改造自己哩！”原来对军政大学有些怀疑，有些害怕当兵苦，感到恐怕太不自由的同学们，这时也不禁笑嘻嘻的边谈边打着自己趣儿说：“以前怕当女兵人笑话，今天我才感到军大是个了不起的大学校，大家庭；既那么耐心地改造了你，却又使你感到非常的温暖和热情；这回妈妈苦再写信叫我回去，我可要纠正她那落后的脑筋了。”
