　　Intestinal Problems in Late Summer and Early Autumn
　　How to Prevent Dysentery

To the Editor:

　　Dysentery, a disease that endangers lives in the late summer and autumn, has begun to spread again in rural areas. In Bai Zi Wan Village, a sub-district under the jurisdiction of the No. 1 Suburban Precinct, Li Chunsheng's five-year-old child first had diarrhea and then developed dysentery. The child died less than a day after falling ill. A month ago, Li's three-year-old daughter also died from the same disease. The villagers are now very frightened and avoid contact with each other. Therefore, I request that the editor provide some simple hygiene knowledge and easy-to-implement methods of preventing transmission, so that the police stations can conduct publicity and assist the masses in jointly preventing this terrible disease.

　　He Derong, No. 1 Suburban Precinct

Comrade He Derong:

　　Your inquiry about the transmission of dysentery is indeed a matter that all citizens should pay attention to, especially at this time of late summer and early autumn when the disease is prone to epidemic. We have received a reply from the Municipal Health Bureau, and we hope to publicize it widely to arouse widespread vigilance among the masses.

　　Prevention of Dysentery

　　Dysentery is an infectious disease that is prone to occur in summer and autumn. Bacteria enter the human body and cause lesions in the intestines. Mild cases can recover in a few days, while severe cases can be fatal, especially for children, where the mortality rate is even higher. The transmission of this disease is likely due to unclean food, fingers, eating utensils, or drinking unboiled water and eating raw vegetables, etc. Therefore, unboiled water should not be drunk, and raw vegetables should not be eaten. These are the causes of the disease. Knowing these points, we also understand the necessity of prevention. The prevention methods are as follows:

　　I. Eliminate Flies and Prevent Flies:

　　Flies are the medium of transmission, so our first prevention method is to eliminate flies. Either kill them or spray DDT. It is best to kill maggots, because maggots are the larvae of flies, living in cesspools, manure piles, dirty water, and garbage. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the cleanliness of the kitchen and toilet. Rural toilets have no roofs or walls, and because of wind and rain, spraying DDT is useless except in the cesspool. Dig small ditches around the cesspool to store water, and add a little kerosene to the water surface (kerosene can kill the maggots of large-headed flies). When the maggots grow up, they will crawl to dry land to pupate, and the pupae will turn into flies. When the maggots crawl out of the pit and fall into the ditch, they can be drowned. Also, after each bowel movement, cover it with a layer of lime powder, fine stove ash, or soil, which is also helpful. In addition, there are fly traps and flypaper, etc.

　　II. Isolate Patients:

　　Patients should be separated from healthy people in separate rooms, and their eating utensils, bedpans, clothes, bedding, children's toys, etc. should also be separated. Healthy people should not go to their rooms. Those who care for these patients should preferably not enter the kitchen. If it is absolutely necessary, disinfect both hands according to disinfection methods to avoid infecting others.

　　III. Pay Attention to Disinfection:

　　1. Disinfection of feces: The feces containing infectious bacteria must be disinfected. After the patient excretes, add carbolic acid (2.5%) or limewater (one part lime and eight parts water), or lime plus boiling water, to the container and stir the feces to break them up. Soak for two hours before pouring into the cesspool or burying them underground. 2. Disinfection of bedpans: Boiling for fifteen minutes is reliable and easy to do; or pour alcohol on it and burn it thoroughly; or soak it in carbolic acid solution for two hours. 3. Disinfection of patients' clothes and utensils: It is best to boil them, or soak them in Lysol solution for one hour. 4. Hand disinfection: Prepare a basin of Lysol water in the ward. Whether your hands are contaminated or not, soak them in Lysol water when leaving the ward, or wash them with hot water and soap; especially before eating, pay more attention to this; immediately wash your hands after attending to the patient's bowel movements, and then do other things.

　　IV. Pay Attention to Diet:

　　Dysentery is transmitted through diet, so pay attention to the cleanliness of the diet. Food that flies have landed on must be boiled before eating. Leftover rice and vegetables should be reheated before eating; do not eat raw vegetables or drink unboiled water. Wash your hands before eating. The patient's leftover food should be burned or boiled and discarded, and healthy people should not eat it to prevent infection.

　　V. Preventive Injections:

　　Vaccine injections are also quite effective in preventing dysentery, but there are no exact records; the reaction after injection is relatively large.

　　VI. Pay Attention to Carriers:

　　After recovery, the patient's body still carries bacteria that can be transmitted, which can only be eliminated after about four to six weeks. Therefore, stool should still be checked frequently for isolation and disinfection.

　　The above are easy-to-implement prevention methods. I hope you will publicize them as much as possible. The transmission and prevention of typhoid fever and cholera are roughly the same. However, the preventive injections for typhoid fever and cholera are indeed effective and have small reactions. I hope that you will pay attention to the cleanliness of diet and the hygiene of the environment for gastrointestinal infectious diseases. With preventive injections, diseases can be prevented.

### 夏秋之交肠胃开　怎样预防痢疾

专栏：询问与答复

　　夏秋之交肠胃开
  　怎样预防痢疾编者同志：
    夏秋季间致人伤命的痢疾又开始在农村蔓延了。郊一管界百子湾村李春生之五岁小儿，先泻肚后转为痢疾。病后不到一天的功夫就死去了。在一月前该李某的三岁女儿亦因患此病死去。现该村各户都很惊恐，不敢来往。故请编者同志提供一些浅近的卫生常识及简而易举的预防传染的方法，以便各派出所进行宣传和协助群众共同防御这可怕的疾病。
  　　郊一分局何德荣何德荣同志：
    你所询问关于痢疾传染的问题，的确是一般市民都应当注意的问题，尤其当此夏秋之交更是该病易于流行的时候，今承市卫生局予以答复，希广为宣传，以唤起群众的普遍警惕。  　　　　
　　编者
　　痢疾的预防
    痢疾是夏秋两季易发的传染病。细菌进入人体就在肠子里发生病变，轻的几天可以痊愈，重的可以致命，尤其对于小孩死亡率更大。这种病的传染大概是由食物、手指、食具等的不洁，或是饮生水，吃生菜等等原因。所以生水不能喝，生菜不能吃。以上就是得病的原因，我们知道了这几点，也就知道了预防的必要。预防的方法如下：
    一、灭蝇防蝇：
    苍蝇是传染的媒介，所以我们第一个预防的办法就是灭蝇。或是打死，或是用ＤＤＴ喷洒。最好是灭蛆，因为蛆是蝇的幼虫，生活在粪坑里、马粪堆里、脏水和垃圾里，所以我们注意厨房和厕所的清洁实是必要。乡下的厕所没有屋顶或墙，因为风吹雨打，除了粪坑之外喷ＤＤＴ是没用的，在粪坑周围掘小沟存水，水面加一点煤油（有煤油可以杀大头蝇的蛆），蛆长大了就要爬到干的土地去作蛹，由蛹就变成蝇，当蛆爬出坑来，落到沟里就可淹死了。还有在每次大便之后，用石灰面或细炉灰或是土盖上一层，也要好一点。此外还有捕蝇器捕蝇纸等等。
    二、隔离病人：
    这种病人应该同无病的人分开住室，他用的饮食器具、便盆、衣服、被褥、小孩玩具等等都要分开。没有病的人不要到他屋里去。看护这种病人的人，最好不进厨房，万不得已，要按照消毒方法将两手消毒以免传染他人。
    三、注意消毒：
    １粪便消毒：这种带有传染性细菌的粪便必须注意消毒，即在病人排泄之后，在便器内加入石炭酸（百分之二·五）或石灰水（石灰一分水八分），或石灰加沸水，并须将粪块搅碎，浸二小时后再倒入粪坑，或埋于地下。２便器消毒；煮沸十五分钟既可靠，又易办；或是倒上酒精烧，要烧得周到；或是泡在石炭酸液内二小时。３病人衣服用器消毒；顶好是煮沸，不然就泡在来苏液内一小时。４手的消毒：病房里预备一盆来苏水，无论手上沾染没有，在出病房时均须在来苏水内泡泡，否则也要用热水肥皂刷洗；尤其是在饮食之先，更要注意此点；招呼病人大便之后，应当立即洗手，然后再作其他事情。
    四、饮食注意：
    痢疾是由饮食传染的，就要注意饮食的清洁，苍蝇落上的食物必须经过煮沸之后方可再食，剩饭、剩菜要热过再吃；不要吃生菜、生水。吃东西时候要先洗手。病人残余的食物，应当烧弃或煮沸后弃去，无病的人不要吃，以防传染。
    五、预防注射：
    疫苗的注射预防也有相当效果，惟尚无确切的记载；注射后反应较大。
    六、注意带菌人：
    病愈以后病人体内仍带有细菌，可以传染，约要经过四—六星期方能消灭。所以仍然要常常检查大便，以便隔离及消毒。
    以上是容易作到的预防法，希望尽量宣传。其他如伤寒、霍乱的传染和预防问这大致一样，不过伤寒、霍乱的预防注射效力确实反应亦小，希望对于肠胃的传染病要注意饮食的清洁，环境的卫生，再有预防注射，即可不致发生疾病了。
