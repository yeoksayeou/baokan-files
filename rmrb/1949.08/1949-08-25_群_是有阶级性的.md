　　"The 'Group' Has Class Character"
    Gao Fang
    There is a difference between "group" and society: Although mankind has lived in groups from beginning to end (note: Wang Ping uses "group" to refer to living in groups, not the combination of humans in primitive society in contrast to the family), since our ancestors broke away from the animal state and engaged in production to obtain means of subsistence, people have formed organized societies. Because of different modes of production, human society has gone through five stages of development: ancient society, feudal society, etc. Animals also live in groups, but they have never and cannot form societies. It is problematic to indiscriminately explain the problem by not distinguishing between the "group" that constitutes an organized society of human beings and the "group" of animals.
    There is a difference between "group" and class: Since the collapse of primitive society, human groups have been divided into exploiter groups (exploiting classes) and exploited groups (exploited classes). Peasants and past exploited classes are groups, and slave owners, feudal lords, and capitalists, while representing private interests, are also groups. Therefore, if one does not peel off the skin of the "group" to see, and does not clearly point out that the continuous, sometimes hidden and sometimes open struggle of each class in each historical stage promotes the development of society, it is inappropriate to vaguely say that the group is the only force for human development.
    There is a difference between "group" and communist ideas: The author says that primitive society "only had great masses, and the masses created wealth," and also says that "when the masses were engrossed in creating wealth and improving human tools, and there was a surplus of products, then on the basis of the surplus, something opposite to the group—private ownership—had the opportunity to grow," and thus "the group was destroyed by private ownership." Here, the author obviously interprets "group" as a communist concept, as the public ownership of property, which is incorrect. In fact, humans still lived in groups after class society began. Although the clan commune was destroyed by the private property system, the human "group" was not destroyed by the private system; it was only that the group in the form of the original family began to be divided into two antagonistic classes. Moreover, when the peasant masses rise up to fight, this is class struggle. By their nature, peasants never thought of overthrowing the private system (if they did, they only wanted to return to the original rural commune, such as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution), and it was not, as the author said, that they "intended to use the power of the group to overthrow private ownership." (Note: Those who own private property are also not just one person, but also form a "group.") Here, the author understands the human "group" as a communist concept, as public ownership.
    In short, Wang Ping did not clearly mention labor, human society, class, class struggle, and the public ownership system, but only used a vague and general word "group" to summarize everything and to explain that this is the "only force for human development," which is extremely inappropriate.

　　“群”是有阶级性的
    高放
    群与社会有别：人类虽然自始至今都是群居（注意：王坪用“群”指群居，并不是指人类在原始社会中与家族相对立的结合形态），但是我们的祖先自从脱离了动物状态进行生产以取得生活资料时起，人们就结成了有组织的社会；因为生产方式的不同，人类社会在发展过程中又有古代社会、封建社会……等五个发展阶段。动物也有群居的，但是它们从来也没有，而且不可能结成社会。把人类结成有组织的社会底“群”与动物底“群”不加区别，而笼统地来说明问题是有毛病的。
    群与阶级有别：自从原始社会崩溃以后，人类的群就分为剥削者群（剥削阶级）与被剥削者群（被剥削阶级）。农民与历代各被剥削阶级是群，奴隶主封建主资本家固然是代表私的利益也何尝不是群？所以不剥开“群”的皮来看，不明确指出各个阶级在各个历史阶段中进行不间断的、有时隐藏有时公开的斗争才推动着社会向前发展，只笼统含糊地说群是人类赖以发展的唯一力量，这是不妥当的。
    群与共产观念有别：作者说原始社会“只有伟大的群众，是群众创造着财富”，又说“当群众在埋头创造财富，改善了人类的工具，生产品有了剩余的时候，就在剩余的基础上，与群相反的一种东西——私，就有了生长的机会了”，于是“群被私破坏了”。在这里作者显然又把“群”当作共产观念当作财产公有制解释这是不对的。其实阶级社会开始以后人类还是群居，氏族公社虽然被私有财产制度破坏了，但人类的“群”并没有被私有制度破坏，只是原始家族形态的群被开始分为两个敌对的阶级而已。而且农民群众起来作战这是阶级斗争，农民按其本性来说从没想到去推翻私有制度（有的话也只是想回复到原始农村公社，如太平天国革命），并不是如作者所说的“意图用群的力量去推翻私的”。（注意：财产“私”有者也不是只有一个人，也是成“群”的）作者在这里则把人“群”理解为共产观念公有制度。
    总之，王坪没有明确说到劳动、人类社会、阶级、阶级斗争、公有制度，而只是拿一个含糊笼统的“群”字来概括一切，来说明这是人类“赖以发展的唯一力量”，这是极不妥当的。
