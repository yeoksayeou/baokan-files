Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 29th: Comrade Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a summary report at the joint conference of prefectural party secretaries of the Guanzhong New District on August 4th, entitled "Review of Work in the Guanzhong New District and Current Tasks." The text is as follows:

		Successfully Complete the Initial Takeover of the New District and Create a Favorable Situation for the Liberation of the Entire Northwest

	As a result of the heroic battles and massive annihilation of the enemy by the People's Liberation Army, all 42 counties of Guanzhong have been liberated in just over two months. In order to support the hundreds of thousands of troops to continue their victorious advance, and to more rapidly and soundly carry out various democratic reforms and construction work in the vast new liberated areas, our first step in the takeover work in the new liberated areas should focus on the main goals of eliminating reactionary local armed forces, stabilizing order, restoring production, and supporting the front lines. Over the past two months, our work in the Guanzhong area has basically completed its tasks. First, we rapidly and relatively orderly took over dozens of cities and vast rural areas from top to bottom, protected national property such as railways, postal and telecommunications, and factories, and actively worked to restore transportation and production. Second, we eliminated and reorganized nearly 20,000 rifles of local reactionary teams and bandits, and initially carried out the work of eliminating special agents, making the organized reactionary armed forces in the territory almost extinct, and isolating scattered bandits and lurking enemy special agents. At the same time, various localities actively worked to establish local people's armed forces, so that the entire Guanzhong area maintained a generally stable social order in the early days of the new liberation. Third, as a result of the above work, we obtained the foundation to vigorously support the front lines, support our field army in winning the Huazhong Battle and rapidly advancing westward, creating a favorable situation for the liberation of the entire Northwest. These achievements are due to the long-term work and influence of our party in the Guanzhong area, the unprecedentedly high revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, and the active efforts of all our cadres and party members. If our first step had not been this way, but instead inappropriately and prematurely carried out this or that social reform, we would have deviated from reality and increased our own difficulties. We first strive to quickly stabilize large areas to stabilize the people's hearts, unite the masses, and support the war; and then steadily embark on the second and third steps. Doing so is beneficial to the liberation war and the broad masses of the people. This is the main experience of this period of work. Of course, there are still many shortcomings in our work during this period, such as "grasping the big heads" or assigning tasks equally; failing to promptly educate and transform the reorganized reactionary local armed forces, the existence of bad people in some local governments, and failing to use the greatest strength to restore and develop production in urban work. All of these must be resolutely corrected in future work.

	After this period of work, we first learned that in the Guanzhong area, except for Xi'an and Baoji, which have some modern industries, the rest are commercial consumer cities, and industrial production accounts for a very small proportion of the national economy. Second, land in the Guanzhong countryside is not very concentrated. Landlords account for less than one percent of rural households, plus rich peasants accounting for about six percent in total, accounting for about 20 percent of the land in total; middle peasants account for 40 to 50 percent of households and 50 to 60 percent of the land. However, the vast rural areas are still under the rule of landlords, despots, and counter-revolutionary forces. They cruelly plunder and exploit the peasants in various ways. Third, the war is still continuing, and it will take some time for all the provinces in the Northwest to be liberated. After all of the Northwest is liberated, there will still be wars in the interior of the Southwest, and the task of supporting the war is still very heavy. Combining these three situations—the weakness of the industrial economy and commercial consumer cities, facing the feudal-ruled countryside, and being in a war environment—these are the basic characteristics of the current situation in the new district, and this is the starting point on which we must base our decision-making on guidelines, policies, and work steps.

		Future Work Enters the Second Stage

	Starting from this situation, we must correctly implement the line of the Second Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee—the general policy of "shifting the focus of work from the countryside to the cities, and leading the countryside from the cities." This requires learning from the Hua Zhong Bureau's pragmatic work steps: "The first step is to take over the urban and rural areas well, especially the cities, and at the same time spread out with great strength in necessary areas to solve the problem of supporting the front lines and the necessary raw materials and supplies for the cities. After this step is completed, the party's focus of work will immediately be placed in the countryside for a certain period of time to eliminate bandits, special agents, and remnants of counter-revolutionary forces, and carry out various democratic and social reforms, while also taking into account the cities. When the feudal countryside is transformed into a democratic countryside, and the conditions for developing the cities are met, the focus of work will be shifted to the cities again, using the greatest strength to develop the cities, while also taking into account the countryside. At all times, we must never relax urban work, let alone relax support for the war and the People's Liberation Army. We must never ignore this point, otherwise we will make serious mistakes." These steps are all applicable here. In the Guanzhong area, except for the Baoji and Qianxian sub-districts, which were liberated slightly later, the work of taking over urban and rural areas in most areas has been completed in the first step, and now we must move to the second step, placing the party's focus of work in the countryside while also taking into account the cities. It will take several years to complete this stage of work. This stage must be divided into several specific steps in practice. Based on the actual situation in the Guanzhong area, we have decided that in the nearly ten months from now until the summer harvest next year, we will first carry out the struggle against local despots, bandit suppression, and elimination of special agents, etc., against the landlord class power-holders, step by step, to overthrow the main enemies in the countryside and establish the superior strength of the peasants. All other work must be carried out around the mass base for carrying out this struggle, in order to achieve the purpose of weakening the feudal forces in the countryside and preparing conditions for further social reforms in the future. The following are the several important tasks of this period:

		Several Important Tasks

	(1) Correctly grasp policies, implement reasonable burdens, and continue to support the front lines with great effort. To this end, we must further organize and educate the masses, establish various reasonable systems, and strengthen leadership to overcome difficulties, save manpower, and do our best to achieve mutual benefit for both war and production.

	(2) Actively establish people's armed forces and continue to eliminate reactionary armed forces. The period of massively reorganizing enemy and puppet armed forces has passed in Guanzhong. The current central task is rectification and transformation. During rectification and transformation, it is necessary to establish an army directly created and led by the Party in the mobilization of the masses. Local troops should improve their combat effectiveness in strengthening bandit suppression. Bandit suppression is an urgent task. Local troops should first be combat teams and then gradually trained into work teams. Bandit suppression should focus on pursuing and suppressing organized bandits, and universally eliminating scattered bandits and confiscating reactionary armed forces. Both should be carried out in combination, and it is imperative to completely and cleanly eliminate the bandits. At the same time, bandit suppression must combine military and political affairs, combine suppression and pacification, and combine with the struggle of mobilizing the broad masses against local despots, bandits, and special agents.

	(3) Launch a mass struggle against local despots, bandits, and special agents. The despotic elements, who are combined with special agents, teams, and bandits, that is, the power-holders of the landlord class, are still the ruling forces in the countryside. And deploying special agent activities, breeding bandit armed forces, and carrying out counter-revolutionary disturbances are important conspiracies of the Kuomintang reactionaries' dying struggle. The despots, special agents, and bandits who are combined in this way constitute the most important remnants of counter-revolutionary forces in the countryside, that is, the main enemies of the rural people. Only by overthrowing these evil forces can we establish the superior strength of the rural people. The struggle against local despots, bandits, and special agents can and must form a broad united front in the countryside, relying on poor and hired peasants, uniting all middle peasants, and striving for and neutralizing all possible social forces that can be won over and neutralized, and carrying out the struggle step by step, orderly, and under leadership. Different struggle strategies should be adopted for different targets. We should distinguish between those who resolutely attach themselves politically to the Kuomintang and actively carry out counter-revolutionary activities, and those who are willing to bow their heads to the people. We must distinguish between all other different situations and adopt different treatment methods. The most important key is that all party members must be mobilized to go deep into the countryside to do arduous mass work, carry out struggles in a wave-like manner with a focus, break through one point, promote the overall situation, and develop from point to area, and take root in all areas. This is the first major war to change the feudal countryside in the new district. We must prepare well and organize well in order to be confident of victory.

	(4) Destroy the Baojia system, purge Kuomintang personnel, and initially establish rural people's democratic power. The stage of using the old Baojia system in the Guanzhong area should end soon. In mobilizing the masses to fight against local despots, bandits, and special agents, we should cooperate in purging enemy personnel and initially carry out democratic power construction. Doing so is not to confuse the goals and widen the scope of attack; but precisely to enable those who were forced to serve during the enemy's rule, or who have minor bad deeds, and who are willing to repent to the people, to be treated leniently after proper handling by the masses, so that the few heinous criminals who are incorrigible are more isolated, so as to strengthen the struggle against local despots, bandits, and special agents. After purging rural enemy personnel, they are generally ordered to return home to produce. The activists who emerge from the peasant masses should be elected to the organs of power in large numbers, and their education should be strengthened to make the entire rural work face completely new. The county-level government can first adopt the form of convening representative meetings of all circles to strengthen contact with the masses.

	(5) Organize peasant associations, build the Party and the League. Each county should organize preparatory committees for peasant associations from top to bottom and mobilize all localities to establish peasant associations. Rural peasant associations should be organized with a focus first, gradually developed, and then convene peasant representative meetings at the township, district, and county levels according to the development situation and the degree of awareness of the peasant masses, and pay attention to cultivating poor and hired peasant leadership backbones in the peasant associations to strengthen leadership. Young women should all be organized within the peasant association. The organizations of the underground Party and the Youth League should be reorganized to strengthen class education. At the same time, new and old cadres must unite and help each other, and carry out Party and League building work in a planned way.

	(6) The above tasks must be completed on the basis of launching mass movements. August and September are the busy farming season. We must actively lead the masses to plant winter wheat, harvest cotton, complete the summer conscription, and fulfill the necessary tasks of supporting the front lines. After October, we should shift to a period centered on the mass movement against local despots, bandits, and special agents, and cooperate in building the army, building the government, building the Party, and other work. All localities should formulate their own work plans based on the above principles and based on local conditions.

	For a certain period from now on, the focus of the Party's work will be placed in the countryside, but urban work must also be taken into account at the same time. In urban work, we must soberly grasp the direction of work and strive to do the following work well during a certain period: (1) Continue to unite all employees, restore and develop production, and take this as the center of all work. (2) Strengthen the work of eliminating special agents and bandits and consolidate revolutionary order. (3) Use great efforts to solve the unemployment problem, grasp the transformation and proper resettlement of the original public and educational personnel, and organize unemployed working people to participate in various production activities or go to the countryside to reclaim wasteland. (4) Develop transportation, stabilize finance, develop cooperative undertakings, and encourage the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. (5) Mobilize a large number of Communist Party members, young students, and progressive elements to go to the countryside to strengthen rural work. The purpose of doing so is to powerfully cooperate with the countryside in completing democratic reforms and supporting the front lines in the current period, and to restore urban production undertakings, and strive for some further development, gradually cure the old lazy and bloated pathological phenomena in the cities, and lay a good foundation for the next step of developing the cities with all our strength and building new cities for the people's production.

		Mobilize a Large Number of Cadres to Go to the Countryside

	Finally, to implement the Party's guidelines and policies, we must seriously improve and enhance the leadership work of Party committees at all levels, and mobilize a large number of cadres and all forces that can be mobilized to go to the countryside in a planned and organized manner. We must concentrate the use of cadres, and leading comrades should personally preside over one place, gain experience, and promote the overall situation. Do not carry out isolated trials. Once there is a point, it must be developed to the area to promote the development of the broad mass movement. In the wave of the mass movement, we must adhere to the correct leadership of the Party and emphasize the seriousness of implementing policies; the instructions and decisions of the superior Party committees must be carefully studied and effectively conveyed and educated within the Party. If there are different opinions, they can be put forward, but the original decisions must still be implemented before being approved by the superior Party committee; when encountering new problems, first ask the superior Party committee for instructions before handling them. At the same time, we should pay attention to the combination of urban and rural areas, exchange information, and use various methods to strengthen the links between counties and districts, and stipulate a system of reporting work every three to five days. Leading comrades often go down to inspect, and use newspapers and Party publications to quickly disseminate and exchange experiences. We must improve the Party committee system at all levels to discuss policies, connect with the lower levels, strengthen specific leadership, and improve work efficiency. Cadre learning should be strengthened. The focus is on learning policies, and it should be combined with studying the situation in the new district and summarizing the experience of the new district, gradually improving the ideological level of Marxism-Leninism, reducing the commission of empiricist errors, and overcoming the phenomenon of "the more chaotic, the busier, and the busier, the more chaotic." As long as each of our cadres can soberly know the direction of work, follow the correct policies and steps, and constantly improve their ideological awareness, the victory of our revolutionary cause will be guaranteed.

　　关中新区工作的检讨和当前任务
    习仲勋同志在关中新区地书联席会上的总结报告
    【新华社西安二十九日电】中共中央西北局书记习仲勋于八月四日在关中新区地委书记联席会上作了总结报告，题为“关中新区工作的检讨和当前任务，文如下：
    　　　　胜利完成新区初步接管工作　造成解放整个西北有利形势
    由于人民解放军英勇善战，大量歼敌的结果，在两个多月的时间内，关中四十二县已全部解放。为了支援数十万大军继续胜利前进，和更迅速、更健全地开展广大新区各项民主改革和建设工作，我们在新解放区接管工作的第一步，应当把工作方向集中到消灭反动地方武装、安定秩序、恢复生产、支援前线这几项主要目标上去。两个多月来，我们在关中地区的工作基本上完成了任务。第一，迅速地比较有秩序地、自上而下地接管了几十个城市和广大乡村，保护了铁路、邮电和工厂等国家财产，积极努力地恢复交通，恢复生产。第二，消灭和收编了地方反动团队和土匪近两万人枪，初步开展了肃清特务的工作，使境内成股的反动武装已近绝迹，零散土匪和潜伏的敌人特务更加孤立。同时，各地积极努力地建立人民地方武装，使整个关中地区在新解放初期就保持了大体安定的社会秩序。第三，因此，由于上述的工作的结果，我们得到大力支援前线的基础，支援我野战军取得扶＠战役的胜利和迅速西进，造成解放整个西北的有利形势。这些成绩，是由于我们党在关中地区有长时期的工作和影响，广大群众革命热情的空前高涨，以及我全体干部党员的积极努力而得来的。如果我们的第一步不是这样做，而是不适当地、过早地去进行这样或那样的社会改革，就会脱离实际，增加自己的困难。我们首先力求大块大块的地区迅速稳定下来，以安定人心，团结群众，支援战争；然后再去稳当地迈上第二步和第三步，这样做，是于解放战争、于广大人民群众有利的。这是这一时期工作的主要经验。当然，我们这一时期的工作中，也还存在不少缺点，如“抓大头”或平均摊派；收编反动地方武装后未抓紧予以教育改造，有些地方政权存在滥用坏人现象，以及城市工作中未用最大力量去进行恢复与发展生产等，这些，都必须在今后工作中切实纠正。
    经过这一时期的工作，我们首先了解了关中地区除西安、宝鸡有一些现代工业外，其余都是商业性的消费城市，工业生产在国民经济中的比重十分微小。其次，关中农村土地不很集中，地主占农村户口不到百分之一，加上富农共占百分之六左右，共占土地百分之二十左右；中农占户口百分之四十到五十，占土地百分之五十到六十。但广大农村还是在地主恶霸和反革命势力的统治下。他们经过种种方式去残酷地掠夺和剥削农民。再次，目前战争尚在继续，西北各省全部解放尚需一个时期，在西北全部解放后，西南内地还有战争，支援战争的任务，仍然是很繁重的。综合这三种情况——工业经济的微弱和商业性的消费城市，面对封建统治的农村，处于战争环境——就是目前新区情况的基本特点，就是我们决定方针、政策和工作步骤所必须依据的出发点。
　　今后工作进入第二步
    从这种情况出发，我们必须正确执行党中央二中全会的路线——“把工作重心从乡村移到城市，并由城市领导乡村”的总方针，这就必须学习华中局实事求是地所提出的工作步骤：“第一步要把城乡接管好，特别要把城市接管好，同时以极大力量散布在必要地区，解决支援前线及城市必须的原料与供应问题。这一步结束之后，就立即将全党的工作重心在一定时期内先放在农村，肃清土匪特务及反革命残余势力，进行各种民主改革与社会改革，同时兼顾城市。当封建的农村改变成民主的农村以后，发展城市的条件具备了，再将工作重心移向城市，用最大力量发展城市，同时又兼顾农村。在各个时期，都绝不能放松城市工作，更不能放松对战争和人民解放军的支援，这一点我们决不能忽视，忽视了就要犯严重的错误。”这些步骤在我们这里是全部适用的。关中地区，除宝鸡、＠县两分区解放稍迟外，大部地区第一步接管城乡的工作已经完成，现在就要转入第二步，把全党的工作重心放在农村同时兼顾城市。完成这一阶段的工作，需要几年的时间。这个阶段，在实行中又须划分为若干具体步骤。依据关中地区实际情况，我们决定从现在起到明年夏收以前近十个月的时间内，首先有步骤地开展反恶霸、清剿土匪、肃清特务等反地主阶级当权派的斗争，打倒农村里的主要敌人，树立农民的优势力量。其他一切工作，都要围绕着开展这一斗争的群众基础上去进行，以达到削弱农村封建势力的目的，并为将来进一步的社会改革准备条件。这一时期的几项重要工作，分述如下：
　　几项重要工作
    （一）正确掌握政策，实行合理负担，用大力继续支援前线。为此无们要进一步组织和教育群众，建立各种合理制度并加强领导，以克服困难，节省民力，尽可能做到战争和生产两利。
    （二）积极建立人民武装，继续肃清反动武装。大量收编敌伪武装的时期，在关中已经过去了，现在的中心工作是整训改造。在整训改造时，必须在发动群众中去建立党所直接创造和领导起来的军队。地方部队要在加强剿匪中提高战斗力。剿匪是当务之急，地方部队首先应该是战斗队，然后再逐渐训练成为工作队。剿匪要有重点地追剿股匪，普遍清剿散匪，收缴反动武装，两者结合进行，并务必把土匪彻底、干净地消灭。同时剿匪还必须军政结合，剿抚兼施，并与发动广大群众的反恶霸反土匪反特务的斗争结合起来。
    （三）开展反恶霸，反土匪，反特务的群众斗争。与特务、团队、土匪相结合的恶霸分子，即地主阶级的当权派，仍然是农村中的统治势力。而布置特务活动、繁殖土匪武装、进行反革命骚动，又是国民党反动派垂死挣扎的重要阴谋。这样互相结合的恶霸、特务、土匪，就组成了农村中最主要的反革命残余势力，亦即农村人民的主要敌人。只有打倒这一恶势力，才能建立农村人民的优势力量。反恶霸、反土匪、反特务斗争，可能而且必须组成农村中广泛的统一战线，依靠贫雇农，团结全体中农，争取和中立一切可能争取和中立的社会力量，有步骤、有秩序、有领导地去进行斗争。应当分别对象，采取不同的斗争策略。应当把那些政治上坚决依附国民党的积极进行反革命活动的分子，和那些愿意向人民低头的分子区别开来。要把其他各种不同的情况，区别开来，采取不同的对待办法。最重要的关键在于：必须动员全体党员，深入到农村中去，做艰苦的群众工作，有重点地波浪式地开展斗争，突破一点，推动全局，由点到面，面面生根。这是改变新区封建农村的第一个主要的战争，必须准备好，组织好，才能有把握地取得胜利。
    （四）摧毁保甲，清理国民党人员，初步建立乡村人民民主政权。在关中地区利用旧保甲阶段，应很快结束。在发动群众反恶霸、反土匪、反特务斗争中，应配合清理敌方人员，初步进行民主政权建设。这样做，不是要把目标搞乱，把打击面放宽；而正是为了使那些在敌人统治时期被强迫服役、或劣迹较小、愿向人民悔过自新的分子，可以经过群众适当处理，受到宽待，而使少数怙恶不悛的罪大恶极分子更加孤立，以加强反恶霸、反土匪、反特务的斗争力量。在清理农村敌方人员后，一般令其回家生产。对农民群众中涌现出的积极分子，应大批地选举到政权机关中来，并加强对他们的教育，使整个农村工作面貌焕然一新。县级政权，可先采取召开各界代表会的形式，加强与群众的联系。
    （五）组织农会，建党建团。各县应自上而下的组织农会筹备会，发动各地成立农会。乡村农会要先有重点地组织，逐步发展，然后按发展情况及农民群众觉悟程度，召开乡、区、县各级农民代表会，并在农会中注意培养贫雇农领导骨干，以加强领导。青年妇女群众都应当组织在农会里边。地下党和青年团的组织，要进行整理，加强阶级教育。同时新老干部必须团结互助，并有计划地开展建党、建团工作。
    （六）以上各项工作，都要在发动群众运动的基础上去完成。八九两月正值农忙，必须积极领导群众种冬麦，收棉花，完成夏征和必要的支援前线任务。十月后，即应转入以反恶霸、反土匪、反特务的群众运动为中心，配合进行建设军队、建设政权、建党及其他工作的时期。各地应依据上述原则，并根据当地情况制订自己的工作计划。
    从现在起的一定时期内，党的工作重心放到农村，但要同时兼顾城市工作。在城市工作中，必须清醒地掌握工作方向，在一定时期内努力做好下列工作：（一）继续团结全体职工，恢复与发展生产，并以此为一切工作的中心。（二）加强肃清特务土匪工作，巩固革命秩序。（三）用大力解决失业问题，抓紧改造和适当安置原有公教人员，组织无业劳动人民参加各种生产或到农村垦荒。（四）发展交通，稳定金融，发展合作事业，鼓励城乡物资交流。（五）动员大批共产党员、青年学生、进步分子到农村去，加强农村工作。这样做的目的是为了在目前时期有力地配合农村完成民主改革和支援前线，并使城市生产事业得到恢复，还争取再有一些发展，逐渐医治城市中旧有的懒惰臃肿的病态现象，为下一步全力发展城市，建设人民的生产的新城市打好基础。
  　动员大批干部到农村去
    最后，要贯彻党的方针和政策，必须认真改进和提高各级党的领导工作，有计划有组织地动员大批干部及可能动员的一切力量到农村中去。要集中使用干部，领导同志亲自主持一处，取得经验，推动全盘。不要孤立试办，有了点一定要发展到面，推动广大群众运动的发展。在群众运动浪潮中，要坚持党的正确领导，强调执行政策的严肃性；上级党的指示、决定，必须认真研究，并在党内进行切实的传达和教育，如有不同意见可以提出，但未经上级党批准前，仍执行原来决定；遇到新问题，先请示上级，然后处理。同时，要注意城乡结合，互通情报，及利用各种方式加强各县各区的联系，规定三天五天报告一次工作的制度。领导同志常下去巡视，利用报纸和党内刊物，迅速传播和交流经验。我们必须健全各级党委制，以研讨政策，联系下边，加强具体领导，提高工作效率。干部学习应加强，中心是学习政策，要和研究新区情况、总结新区工作经验结合起来，逐渐提高马列主义的思想水平，减少犯经验主义的错误，克服“越乱越忙，越忙越乱”的现象。只要我们每个干部都能清醒地知道工作方向，遵循正确的政策和步骤，并不断提高自己的思想觉悟，我们的革命事业的胜利，就有了保证。
