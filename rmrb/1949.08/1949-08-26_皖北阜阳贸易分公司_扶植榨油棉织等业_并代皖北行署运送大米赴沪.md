    Anhui North Fuyang Trading Branch
    Supports Oil Pressing, Cotton Weaving, and Other Industries
    Also Transports Rice to Shanghai on Behalf of the Anhui North Administrative Office

    [Fuyang News] The Fuyang branch of the Anhui North Trading Company is vigorously supporting the oil pressing industry. In June and July, the company supplied 300,000 jin of sesame seeds to Fuyang oil mills, exchanging 100 jin of sesame for 40 jin of oil. This enabled eight oil mills, which had been operating intermittently since May due to insufficient funds, to recover and expand to fourteen. Including those in the suburbs, there are now a total of twenty-eight. The company also entrusted the Linquan County government to lend 400,000 jin of sesame to local oil mills. The first batch of 160,000 jin of sesame oil exchanged has already been shipped to Shanghai. The company also provided 300 bundles of cotton yarn to the weaving industry, agreeing to exchange one jin of yarn for one jin of cloth, with an additional 40 jin of wheat paid per bundle of yarn as wages. The Fuyang weaving industry was originally very developed during the Anti-Japanese War, with over 400 looms. However, due to the devastation by the Kuomintang bandit gangs, all businesses ceased operations by July of last year before liberation. After liberation, although 41 businesses and 50 looms were restored with loans, due to a shortage of raw materials and sluggish sales, only 13 businesses and 13 looms remained by May of this year. After allocating yarn for cloth exchange, the number has increased to 31 businesses and 40 looms. The company also supplied the Production Promotion Cooperative with 1,000 jin of cotton and 40,000 square feet of native cloth, helping women spin yarn and solving the difficulty of obtaining materials for making shoes; allocated 20,000 jin of tobacco leaves to a cigarette factory in exchange for 8,300 packs of cigarettes; and assisted in the opening of a tooth powder factory. Simultaneously with supporting production, the company also transported 8 million jin of rice to Shanghai on behalf of the Anhui North Administrative Office.
