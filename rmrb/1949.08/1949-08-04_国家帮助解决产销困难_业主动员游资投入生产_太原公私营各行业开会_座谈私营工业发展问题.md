    [Our Newspaper] The Taiyuan Municipal People's Government convened a meeting in late July with over thirty representatives from thirteen private sectors, including cotton weaving, machinery, and cloth industries. Representatives from state-owned industries, trade, cooperatives, banks, tax bureaus, and farmer service stations also attended to discuss the development of private industry. All agreed that to facilitate trade between urban and rural areas, smoothly promote finished products, and absorb a large amount of raw materials from rural areas, it is essential to ensure that products meet the needs of the countryside and are of high quality and low price.

    In this regard, the cotton weaving industry proposed, in addition to weaving standard cloth according to the contracts established by the trade company to ensure the quality of the cloth, to also plan to weave plaid and striped cloth, which are easier to sell in rural areas and cannot be woven by large machines. This allows for a reasonable division of labor between large machines and handicrafts, and can also employ more female workers. The hardware and machinery industries plan to produce cotton ginning machines, waterwheels, and other items to supply rural needs.

    During the meeting, Zhou Huamin, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, stated that he would do his best to help solve the various difficulties raised by various industries in production and sales. For example, in terms of raw materials, the machinery industry's monthly requirement of ten tons of round steel and the foundry industry's monthly requirement of one hundred tons of pig iron can be fully supplied by the trade company; the cotton weaving industry's demand for yarn can generally be met; and a portion of the grain needed by other electric mills can also be supplied. In terms of sales, ironwork, foundries, and cotton weaving have no major problems, while electric mills and oil pressing industries face more difficulties, which the government is working with business owners to resolve.

    Regarding the capital difficulties raised by various industries, in addition to the bank issuing 30 million in loans, it is hoped that everyone will do more to absorb idle social funds and mobilize those who have gold and silver to invest in production. In addition, some reflected that Pingyao had restricted people from going there to buy grain. Director Zhou also explained that trade is free within the liberated areas, and if this is true, it is illegal. The government has now sent people to Pingyao, Yuci, and other places to conduct inspections.

    国家帮助解决产销困难
    业主动员游资投入生产
    太原公私营各行业开会
    座谈私营工业发展问题
    【本报讯】太原市人民政府于七月下旬召集私营棉织、机器、布业等十三行的三十余代表，与国营工业、贸易、合作、银行、税局、农民服务所等各单位代表座谈私营工业的发展问题。大家一致认为要沟通城乡贸易，顺利推销成品，及从农村吸收大批原料，首先必须使产品切合农村需要，做到物美价廉。对此，棉织业提出除依照贸易公司所订立之合同织标准布，以保证布的质量外，并计划织格布和条布，这种布到农村易销，且大机器不能织。这样使得大机器与手工业合理的分了工，同时还可多用一部分女工。五金、机器业则计划生产弹花机、水车等供给农村需要。会中市工商局局长周化民对各行业所提在产销中的各种困难，将尽量帮助解决，如在原料方面，机器业每月所需之十吨圆钢，及翻砂每月所需之百吨生铁，均可由贸易公司全部供给；棉织业所需之纱大体上已可供给；其他电磨所需之粮食亦可供给一部。在销路上，铁工、翻砂、棉织等都无大问题，电磨、榨油业较困难，政府正协同业主研究解决。关于各业所提资金之困难，除由银行发放三千万贷款外，则希望大家多为吸收社会游资及动员存有金银者投入生产。此外，有人反映平遥曾限制前往购粮，周局长亦说明解放区内贸易是自由的，如真有其事是违法的。现政府已派人往平遥、榆次等地进行检查。
