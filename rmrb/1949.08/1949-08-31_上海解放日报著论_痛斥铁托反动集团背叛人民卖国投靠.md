Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th. The Shanghai Liberation Daily published an editorial on the 29th entitled "From Betrayal and Defection to Treason and Surrender," commenting on the treasonous behavior of the Yugoslav Tito clique in openly joining the imperialist camp. The editorial stated: A year ago, a resolution of the Cominform pointed out: "The anti-Marxist-Leninist, anti-Party, and anti-Soviet views of the leaders of the Yugoslav Communist Party, and all their actions... have set them against the Communist Parties of the countries participating in the Information Bureau, and have embarked on the road of splitting the united anti-imperialist socialist front, betraying the international solidarity of the workers' cause, and taking a nationalistic stand." "This nationalistic stand may cause Yugoslavia to degenerate into an ordinary bourgeois republic, lose Yugoslavia's independence, and turn Yugoslavia into a colony of imperialist countries." The facts revealed in the Soviet government's reply show that since the Tito clique embarked on the road of betraying Marxism-Leninism and internationalism, it has been following the path predicted by the Cominform resolution, and has reached today's inevitable and shameful reactionary end.

The exposure of the Tito clique's fascist face fully proves and will continue to prove that anyone who engages in anti-socialist Soviet activities will inevitably end up selling out the interests of their own people, selling out the cause of peace and democracy of the people of the world, and surrendering to the reactionary imperialist camp. A year ago, when the Cominform resolution was announced, the Tito clique still pretended to be socialist, only secretly colluded with imperialism, and dared not openly oppose the Soviet Union. Therefore, some people who fantasized about a third way, based on their illusions, believed that a road of "neither pro-Soviet nor pro-American" existed. Today, the facts are already before us. The Tito clique has fallen from spreading rumors and slander to open violence against Soviet citizens, conducting open anti-Soviet activities, and has fallen from secretly colluding with imperialism to openly serving as a tool of imperialism. The Tito clique has completely and thoroughly fallen to the side of imperialism, betraying the Yugoslav people. This ironclad fact fully proves Comrade Mao Zedong's famous saying: "Neutrality is a disguise, and there is no third road." The so-called "third road" is precisely the road of selling out one's own people and falling to the side of imperialism.

The Chinese people, who are engaged in a great people's revolutionary war and are facing national victory, must strengthen their study of Marxist-Leninist theory, understand the viewpoint and principles of combining proletarian internationalism with patriotism from the theoretical basis of Marxism-Leninism, thoroughly understand the truth of "leaning to one side" pointed out by Chairman Mao, which is a basic summary of the long-term revolutionary experience of the people of the world and the Chinese people. We must resolutely support the world peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union, strengthen the unity of the anti-imperialist aggression front of the people of all countries headed by the Soviet Union, and strive to consolidate the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union and defend and consolidate the victory of the Chinese people's revolution.

　　上海解放日报著论
  　痛斥铁托反动集团背叛人民卖国投靠
    【新华社上海三十日电】上海解放日报二十九日以“从背叛变节到卖国投降”为题发表社论，评论南斯拉夫铁托集团公开投入帝国主义阵营的叛卖行为。社论说：一年以前，共产党情报局决议曾经指出：“南共领导者之反马列主义的、反党的、反苏的观点，其一切行为，……这就使他们自己与参加情报局的各国共产党对立起来，走上了分裂统一的反帝国主义的社会主义阵线的道路，走了叛变劳动者的国际团结事业及转向民族主义立场的道路。”“这种民族主义的立场，可能使南斯拉夫蜕化为一般的资产阶级共和国，丧失南斯拉夫的独立，变南斯拉夫为帝国主义国家的殖民地。”从苏联政府复照所暴露的事实真相可以看出，铁托集团自从走上背叛马列主义的、国际主义的道路之日起，便一直走着情报局决议所预言的道路，并一直走到了今天这样必然的可耻的反动的结局。
    铁托集团法西斯面目的暴露，完全证明了并且将继续证明着：凡是进行反对社会主义苏联活动的，就必然要走到出卖其本国人民利益，必然要走到出卖全世界人民的和平民主事业，必然要走向投降帝国主义反动阵营的结局。一年以前，当情报局决议公布的时候，铁托集团还假装着社会主义的面目，对帝国主义还只是暗中勾搭，对苏联还不敢公开反对。因此，使若干幻想第三条道路的人们，根据其错觉，相信“既不亲苏，也不亲美”的道路是存在的。今天的事实已经摆在面前，铁托集团已经由造谣诽谤堕落到对苏联公民的公开暴行，进行公开反苏了，已经由跟帝国主义的暗中勾搭堕落到公开担任帝国主义的工具了。铁托集团已经完全彻底地倒到帝国主义一边，出卖了南斯拉夫人民。这一铁的事实充分证明了毛泽东同志的名言：“中立是伪装的，第三条道路是没有的”。所谓“第三条道路”恰恰是出卖本国人民倒向帝国主义一边去的道路。
    正在进行着伟大的人民革命战争并面临全国胜利的中国人民，必须加强对马列主义理论的学习，要从马列主义的理论基础上认识无产阶级的国际主义与爱国主义相结合的观点和原则，彻底领会毛主席所指出“一面倒”的真理，这是世界人民与中国人民长期革命经验的一个基本总结，我们必须坚决拥护苏联领导的世界和平民主阵营，加强以苏联为首的各国人民的反帝国主义侵略阵线的团结，为巩固中苏伟大友谊、保卫和巩固中国人民革命的胜利而斗争。
