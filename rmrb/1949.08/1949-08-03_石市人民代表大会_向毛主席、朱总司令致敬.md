    Pays Respects to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu
    [Shijiazhuang Electric Dispatch] The entire body of representatives of the first Shijiazhuang People's Congress, in commemoration of the "August 1st" Army Day, especially telegraphs its respects to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army. The telegram roughly states: We deeply know that our ability to gain liberation, to hold such a united and democratic conference here, to establish the people's own democratic regime, and to jointly discuss the city's construction plan is entirely due to your wise leadership and command, and the hard fighting and successive victories of all the army's commanders and fighters. We deeply feel that with the people's army, the people have everything. To celebrate this glorious festival, all the people of our city shall redouble their efforts in production and construction, practice strict economy, actively support the front lines, and help the families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled soldiers engage in production and solve difficulties, strive to resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate the remaining forces of the reactionaries, strive to build an independent, free, peaceful, unified, and prosperous New China, and strive to build a strong people's national defense army.
