　　North China and East China Post Offices
　　Both Develop Remittance Services
　　Full Remittance Between the Two Regions Started Yesterday
　　[Ping City News] The North China Postal Administration has decided to implement full remittance services with the East China region (including Shandong, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai and other postal districts) starting from the 15th of this month. The types of remittances are divided into ordinary postal money orders and telegraphic transfers, with simple procedures and fast remittance. Detailed information can be obtained from post offices and postal remittance offices. The purpose of this full remittance service is threefold: (1) to connect the economies of the two regions; (2) to facilitate tuition fee remittances for students in various places; and (3) to facilitate workers remitting living expenses to their families.

　　[Another News] Shanghai News: Since the establishment of the East China Postal Administration, remittance services have greatly developed. The East China region has fully implemented remittance services since July 1st (except for particularly small places); outside the East China region, negotiated remittance services are available with the entire North China region, Wuchang, Hankou, Henan, Southern Hebei, and other places. In addition, telegraphic transfers have been restored. The three major liberated areas of East China, North China, and Central China can also mutually remit money conveniently. Full postal remittance services between East China and the two major liberated areas of Northeast and Northwest are being actively promoted, and remittances will be possible soon.
