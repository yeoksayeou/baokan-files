　　City Municipal Middle School Adds Eighteen Classes to Enrol Workers' Out-of-School Children; Trade Unions are Registering and Examining
    [This newspaper's report] In order to implement the resolutions of the Ping City Representatives Conference and solve the problem of schooling for workers' out-of-school children in this city, the Education Bureau, based on the specific conditions of various middle schools in the city, plans to add eighteen classes (accommodating about 1,000 students) at the City Municipal Middle School, all of which will enrol workers' out-of-school children. The Education Bureau, together with the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and other relevant agencies, will jointly establish an admissions committee, and the entrance examination will begin on September 3. Currently, the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has been conducting registration and examination of workers' out-of-school children of middle school level through various industrial and trade unions. Workers' children whose families are indeed impoverished and are direct relatives can be issued a letter of introduction to take the entrance examination by the deadline.
