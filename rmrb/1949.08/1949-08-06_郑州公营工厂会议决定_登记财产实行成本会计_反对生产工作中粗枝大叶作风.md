    Zhengzhou Dispatch: A meeting of managers, factory directors, political associates, and accounting personnel from public and joint public-private factories under the Zhengzhou Public Industrial Company discussed methods for clearing property. Due to previous limitations in manpower and certain objective conditions, only general registration of assets was done for each factory, without accurate valuation of various machines, buildings, and inventory, so costs could not be accurately calculated. To change this situation, the meeting determined that each unit should organize a property clearing committee composed of the above personnel and worker representatives to separately register fixed, liquid, and creditor/debtor rights, compile tables, and calculate the total value. This value would be converted into a certain amount of physical objects for accounting purposes. The total value of all assets from the date of takeover, establishment, or joint venture to the end of May would be compared. Profits and losses would be calculated based on the index. Cost accounting will be established, with accounts divided into asset classes (fixed, liquid, miscellaneous), liability types (long-term, short-term), capital stock and public debt classes, profit and loss classes, revenue classes, and loss classes. Regarding cost calculation, it is divided into direct costs (direct materials, direct wages, direct expenses) and indirect costs (indirect materials, indirect labor, indirect expenses). A daily, ten-day, monthly, and annual reporting system will be implemented, with August to October as the trial phase. Comrade Zhao Yiwen concluded the meeting, emphasizing that factories are state property, and we manage "household affairs" for the people, so we should carefully calculate various costs and oppose the "spendthrift" style of carelessly wasting the people's property. At the same time, he called on everyone to carefully study and explore a new accounting system during the three-month trial period.

    郑州公营工厂会议决定
    登记财产实行成本会计
    反对生产工作中粗枝大叶作风
    【郑州讯】郑州公营实业公司所属公营及公私合营厂经理、厂长、政治协理员、会计人员会议，讨论清理财产办法。由于以往人力及某些客观条件限制，对各厂资产仅作一般登记，没有按照各种机件、房屋、库存精确估价，故成本亦不能精确计算。为改变此种情况，会中确定各单位组织清理财产委员会，由以上人员及职工代表组成，分别登记固定、活动及债权债务，编造表册，求出总值，折合一定实物入帐，由接管、开办或合营之日起，至五月底止全部资产总值相比较，根据指数算出盈亏。建立成本会计，科目分为资产类（固定、活动、杂项），负债种（长期、短期），股本及公债类，盈亏类，收益类、损实类；关于成本计算，分直接成本（直接原料、直接薪资、直接费用），间接成本（间接原料、间接人工、间接费用）。并实行日、旬、月、年表报制度，由八月份起至十月份为试行阶段。会议最后赵艺文同志总结，强调提出工厂为国家财产，我们为人民管理“家务”，应当缜密计算各种成本，反对粗枝大叶浪费人民财产的“败家子”作风，同时号召在试行的三个月中，必须细心研究，摸索出一套新的会计制度来。
