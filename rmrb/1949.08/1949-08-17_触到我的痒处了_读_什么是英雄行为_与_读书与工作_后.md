　　Touched My Sore Spot
    ——After Reading “What is Heroic Behavior” and “Reading and Working”
    Zhang Xiao
    "What is Heroic Behavior" and "Reading and Working" are two articles recently published in the People's Daily. On August 13th, "Learning and Life" also published an article by Comrade Deng Xiang entitled "Discussion on What is Heroic Behavior." I have read these articles, and while reading them, sometimes my heart was pounding, or I was blushing, because they really touched my "sore spot."
    After the liberation of Beiping, the first problem I encountered was "Reading and Working": should I continue studying at school, or should I immediately join the workforce? In school, we sang loudly, "We will do whatever the revolution needs us to do," but when faced with the test, when the organization solicited students to participate in work, one student said: "If I participate in work, it will be a loss to China's future, and of course, a loss to me as well." This student believed that he should study academics. In fact, this student, like me, lived in the Faculty of Law and was also one of the targets for participation in work at that time. At that time, I didn't say such things, but my thoughts did fluctuate. If I participated in work, I would lose the opportunity to "go to school," wouldn't it be a loss to myself if I couldn't "pursue advanced studies"? But, at the same time, a voice was attacking me: "Hey, comrade, that's an individualistic idea. Now the revolution needs us to go to work." For two or three days, I was under the siege of two kinds of thoughts, unable to sit or sleep peacefully. I went to talk to comrades who came from the old liberated areas and raised my opinions. They all said, "Go to the work post." I heard many, many valuable insights, and I also saw the simple and arduous work style of many comrades in their work. I felt that I could no longer be a "giant in words, a dwarf in action." Okay! I decided to join the workforce. In this way, the contradiction in my mind was eliminated, and I felt much lighter and happier.
    From then on, I put on the insignia of the Military Control Commission and started working in Beiping. I felt very honored: I had also become a "servant of the people."
    Work was another good test for me. In the district, I did relief work, contacting many poor old people every day, and I had to explain a lot of things to them, but they didn't understand. "Why are they so backward?" When doing cleaning campaigns, I accompanied the people to transport garbage. Sometimes some residents coldly refused to participate. "Why are they so unenthusiastic?" I became anxious in these tasks; without in-depth mobilization and propaganda, I only complained about the masses. I committed the acute illness of the petty bourgeoisie. "Serve the people wholeheartedly," have I been wholeheartedly? "Serve the people wholeheartedly" is not just saying it, but working bit by bit! Later, we mobilized the masses to慰勞 the People's Liberation Army, and the power of the people was displayed: the people who came to the workgroup to send慰勞品 poured in and out like a tide! An old lady who had just finished picking coal cinders would also send a bar of soap as a慰勞品. This is the result of the People's Liberation Army wholeheartedly doing everything for the people! Their sowing and cultivation for more than twenty years has blossomed today. "Learning at work," I understand, what we should learn is not just dogma, but how to put theory into practice.
    The author of "Discussion on What is Heroic Behavior" says: "I review, in my work, I have not been patient in solving the ideological and living problems of some students, and I am impatient: why is it so troublesome! This is the result of lacking the concept of serving the masses wholeheartedly. In a sense, 'revolution is long-term trouble.' It seems that my style is not honest enough. Lenin said: 'Do more daily, small, troublesome work, and say less beautiful words.'" This is not only the author writing about himself, this is writing about me! Isn't Lenin pointing at me?
    Now I am still staying here to work, and the people I approach are still the masses I approached half a year ago. Every day, all kinds of people come to us to discuss all kinds of problems, and sometimes they will fight to the point of bloodshed to seek mediation. At night, we have to go out on patrol. I am working like this, and my heart is very calm. At first, because I was still a little unaccustomed, my body was still a bit "unable to bear it," but later it got better. In the past, I gave the organization my opinion saying: "This job is not suitable for me"; now I don't say that. Because I understand the true meaning of this work, and as Comrade Deng Xiang said: "Can it be said that the great actions of factories and villages striving to produce in order to support the front lines are not heroic acts? They are all unsung heroes, because in our country, New China, heroic behavior has become a mass thing."
    If the purpose of work is to show oneself, to make oneself "vigorous" and "famous," then the word "hero" will drag him into the boundless sea of suffering, or the abyss of sin. In a word, serve the people wholeheartedly, and wholeheartedly is not saying but action!

### 触到我的痒处了——读“什么是英雄行为”与“读书与工作”后

　　触到我的痒处了
    ——读“什么是英雄行为”与“读书与工作”后
    张晓
    “什么是英雄行为”与“读书与工作”是最近人民日报上发表的两篇文章。八月十三日“学习生活”上又登载了邓祥同志的一篇“什么是英雄行为的商讨”。我是看过这几篇文章了，看的时候，有时我在心跳，或者就在脸红，因为他确实触到我的“痒处”了。
    北平解放后，第一个使我碰到的问题是“读书与工作”：是继续的留校读书呢？还是即时参加工作？在学校里高唱“革命需要我们干什么我们就干什么”，可是，面临考验了，那时组织上征求同学们去参加工作，有一个同学说：“假如让我参加工作这是对中国将来的一种损失，当然对我也是一种损失。”这个同学自认自己是应该研究学术的，其实这个同学和我一样住着法学院，也是那时所号召参加工作对象之一。那时我没有说出那样的话，可是我的思想确起了波动，若参加工作，自己“上学”的机会是失掉了，不能“深造”不是对自己的损失吗？但，同时又有一种声音在向我攻击：“喂，同志，那是个人主义的想法，现在革命需要我们走向工作岗位上去了。”两三天内我受了两种思想的夹攻，坐卧不宁。我去找了从老区来的同志谈，把我的意见提出来，他们一致地说“走到工作岗位去”。我听了许多许多宝贵的见解，我也看见了很多的同志们在工作当中朴实坚苦的作风，自己感到自己不能再作“说话的巨人，行动的矮子”了。好！我决定参加工作。这样我思想上的矛盾消除了，觉得轻松了许多，也愉快了许多。
    从此，我带上军管会的符号，在北平城内工作起来。自己觉得很光荣：我也成了“人民的勤务员”了。
    工作对我又是一个好的考验，在区里作救济工作，每日接触好多贫苦的老人，要向他们解释很多的话，他们也听不懂。“他们为什么这么不进步呢？”搞清洁运动，自己随同人民一起运垃圾，有时有些住户冷淡的拒绝参加。“为什么他们这么不热心呢？”在这些工作当中我着急了；没有深入的发动、宣传，专去埋怨群众，我犯了小资产阶级的急性病。“全心全意为人民服务”，我全心全意了么？“全心全意为人民服务”，不是说，而是要一点一滴去工作呵！后来我们发动群众慰劳解放军，人民力量显示了：工作组的门口来送慰劳品的人民象潮水一样的涌进涌出！刚捡完煤核回来的老太太也会送来一块肥皂的慰劳品。这是人民解放军确切地为人民尽了他们所有的力量，所收的成效呵！他们二十余年的播种、耕耘，今天开了花。“在工作中学习”，我明白了，我们学的不应该只是教条，而是学怎样把理论放在实践上。
    “什么是英雄行为的商讨”作者说：“我检讨，在工作中对某些同学思想上、生活上的问题不能耐心地去解决，心里急燥：怎么这么麻烦！这是缺乏全心全意为群众服务观念的结果。在某种意义上讲‘革命就是长期麻烦’，看来，我那种作风是不够老实的，列宁说：‘多做日常的，细小的，麻烦的工作，少说漂亮话。’”这不仅是作者写他自己，这正是写我呵！列宁说的不是指着我说么？
    现在我仍留在这里作工作，所接近的仍然是我半年以前接近的群众。每天有各式各样的人们来和我们讨论各式各样的问题，有时他们会打的头破血流来找求调解。夜里我们要出去巡夜。我这样工作着，我心里很平稳。最初因为还有点不习惯，身体还有点“顶”不住，后来好了。从前我给组织上提意见说：“这个工不适合我作”；现在我不这样说了。因为我了解这工作的真谛，也正如邓祥同志所说：“难道说，工厂里，农村中为了支援前线而努力生产的伟大行动，就不算英雄行为？他们都是无名英雄，因为在我们的国家里，新中国，英雄行为已成为群众性的了。”
    如果工作的目的光想表现自己，使自己“轰轰烈烈”，“喧赫一世”，那末“英雄”二字就会把他拖到无边的苦海，或者罪恶的深渊。一句话，全心全意为人民服务，全心全意不是说而是行动！
