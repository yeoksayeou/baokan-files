    美帝违反对意和约
    竟来武装意国
    战贩们又去伦敦活动
    【新华社北平四日电】各方报道：美国三军参谋长布莱德雷等已于二日自德国西部的法兰克福飞往伦敦。据德意志通讯社消息：当布莱德雷等在法兰克福逗留期间，曾于八月一日与卢森堡和意大利的军事代表举行了会谈。他们讨论了在侵略性的北大西洋公约计划之下这些国家的陆军所面临的任务。据接近美英管制机构的人士所获得的消息称，意大利参谋总部的代表，利用这个机会要求加强意大利的武装力量。他们并要求应允许意大利制造轰炸机与军舰，尽管这是对意和约所断然禁止的。会谈以后，意大利陆军参谋长马拉斯告报界代表称，这一建议得到了美国代表方面的“充分谅解”。美国海军参谋长邓菲尔德补充说：在商谈这些计划时，达到了“完全的协议”。维也纳晚报在报道美意参谋长之间关于意大利参加美国军事战略计划达到协议时指出：“这证明苏联所提违反对意和约照会的抗议，有充分的根据。”
    八月一日，美国参谋长们又曾与德境美军总部的军事代表进行商谈。据息，这些商谈是关于美国武装力量在西欧的活动以及美军总部在直接领导西欧联盟国家方面所面临的工作。德意志通讯社指出：西德政界人士以日益增长的焦虑注视着美国参谋长们的商谈。现在每个人都已明白，西德将被用于达到侵略性的北大西洋公约所追逐的目的。
