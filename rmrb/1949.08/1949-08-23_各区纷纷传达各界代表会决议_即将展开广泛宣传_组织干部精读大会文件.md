　　Various Districts Convey Resolutions of People's Representative Conference
    Extensive Propaganda Campaign to Begin Soon
  　Cadres Organized to Carefully Study Conference Documents
    [Ping City News] The district committees of the Chinese Communist Party, public security sub-bureaus, district governments, and trade union offices in the urban and suburban districts of this city are adopting various methods to convey the resolutions and spirit of the Ping City People's Representative Conference to the masses. In addition to conducting extensive propaganda, the districts will promptly reflect the demands and opinions of the masses directly to the government to strengthen the connection between the government and the masses. They will also mobilize the masses to cooperate with the government in implementing resolutions and promoting various tasks. The twelve districts in the city have formulated propaganda plans. Some districts have already started conveying the information through various mass meetings, while others are preparing to convey and discuss it through different forms such as night schools, worker training classes, industry conferences, and citizen mass meetings convened by police stations. The Second, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, and Twelfth Districts will also organize meetings of workers in various industries, representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors, street vendors, and housewives. Worker representatives, teacher representatives, and leading cadres from various departments who attended the People's Representative Conference will personally report at the meetings. The districts have also decided to use documents such as "Chairman Mao's Speech at the People's Representative Conference," "Comrade Peng Zhen's Summary Report at the People's Representative Conference," and excerpts from Mayor Ye Jianying's "Report on Takeover and Governance Work in the Past Six Months" and the supplementary report on municipal administration as study materials for cadres in the near future.
    In the past day or two, various districts have respectively convened district-wide cadre meetings to convey the spirit and resolutions of the People's Representative Conference. At the Eighth District cadre meeting, Gao Yunqi, secretary of the CCP District Committee, called on all cadres to concretely turn the resolutions into actions, implement them among the masses, carefully study the documents from the conference, and launch a campaign for streamlining and economizing. At the Tenth District cadre meeting, in addition to conveying the spirit and resolutions of the conference, the meeting also discussed Sino-Soviet friendly relations. After the meeting, everyone enthusiastically signed up to join the Beijing branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. At the meeting for all district cadres, neighborhood chiefs, and group leaders in the Twelfth District, Chen Ke, representative of the CCP District Committee, and Fu Shiwen, head of the Public Security Sub-bureau, proposed mobilizing the entire district's masses to continue assisting the government in eliminating special agents and further restoring and developing production. It is expected that various districts will launch enthusiastic propaganda activities in the next day or two to implement the spirit and resolutions of the People's Representative Conference among the masses. The suburban districts of Thirteenth, Fifteenth, and Nineteenth Districts convened meetings of all district cadres and villagers on the 20th and 21st, where representatives who attended the People's Representative Conference conveyed the spirit and resolutions of the conference. Members of the village peasant associations have engaged in heated discussions on the resolutions of the conference.
