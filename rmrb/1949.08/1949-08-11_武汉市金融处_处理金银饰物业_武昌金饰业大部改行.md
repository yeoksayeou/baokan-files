    Wuhan Municipal Financial Office
    Handles Gold and Silver Ornament Assets
    Most Gold Ornament Businesses in Wuchang Change Trades
    [Wuchang News] Before liberation, there were more than 140 gold and silver jewelry businesses in the three towns of Wuhan. After liberation, only Lao Bao Cheng Gold and Silver Products Industry Cooperative applied to the Military Control Commission's Financial Office for registration and review within the prescribed time limit. The Financial Office has approved this cooperative to temporarily operate. The Financial Office has ordered the cooperative to complete registration with the Wuhan Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce and obtain a license before operating in accordance with regulations. All other gold and silver jewelry businesses that have not applied for registration and review will be regarded as automatically closing down. Several gold and silver jewelry businesses that have automatically closed down have already painted over or scraped off their old signs, preparing to change trades. Among the 20 gold and silver jewelry businesses in Wuchang, with the exception of Yuan Ji Lao Wannian, which automatically closed down for reasons of its own, the remaining 19 have all completely changed trades. The businesses they now operate include flour shops, department stores, rubber overshoe shops, cigarette, candle, and soap shops, consignment auction houses, miscellaneous grain shops, tea shops, and coal shops. As the industry has either completely changed trades or closed down, the Financial Office has ordered its association to disband immediately and report to the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce for record. In order to prevent the industry from secretly buying and selling gold and silver, the Financial Office is still closely monitoring all of their business activities. As for the gold and silver jewelry businesses in Hankou, the Financial Office has again urged the industry association to quickly register and report, while also strengthening supervision of the industry to prevent any underground transactions from occurring.

    武昌金饰业大部改行
    【武昌讯】武汉三镇的金银首饰业，在解放前一共是一百四十多家。解放后，在限期以内向军管会金融处申请登记审查的，只有老宝成金银制品工业社一家，这一家业经金融处准可暂时营业。金融处已令该社向武汉市人民政府工商局办妥登记领照手续后依照规定营业。其余未经申请登记审查的，一律作为自动停业论。自动停业的金银首饰业，已有若干家把过去的牌号涂去或者刮掉，准备转业。在武昌廿家金银首饰业当中，除元记老万年一家因故自动停业外，其余十九家都全部转业。转业后所经营之业务包括面粉店、百货店、橡胶套鞋店、香烟烛皂店、委托拍卖行、杂粮店、茶店和炭店。金融处以该业既已全部转业或停业，已令其将公会即日解散，并呈报武汉市工商局备查。为防止该业仍有暗中买卖金银情事，金融处对彼等之一切业务活动，仍严密注意中。至于汉口方面的金银首饰业，金融处已再行令促该业公会迅速册报，同时并加强对该业之监督工作，不使有暗中交易情事发生。
