    The midwifery training class in Hui She Town, Pingshan, is not really a "class" in the formal sense, because the students are all peasant women. The training shouldn't interfere with their household affairs. Since everyone doesn't have clocks and isn't used to keeping time, it's difficult to form a "class." However, it's not individual training either; there's some semblance of a class. This training class has fifteen students and two regular instructors, with two additional helpers when things get busy.
    The task of this class is simply to teach the midwives two things: first, how to cut the umbilical cord to ensure the child doesn't contract umbilical tetanus; and second, how to protect the perineum. In addition, they are taught general hygiene during childbirth to prevent puerperal fever in the mother.
    At the beginning, we connected with the village chief and the women's federation, convened a meeting of village cadres, reported the number and causes of women's and children's diseases and deaths in the village (based on past statistics from the epidemic prevention team), and explained the importance of maternal and child health. We asked everyone to help start this class and discussed the qualifications of the students at the meeting: first, experience in childbirth or midwifery; second, not too busy at home and able to spare time to serve others; and third, no venereal diseases. At that time, we nominated twenty-eight women based on these three criteria. After the meeting, everyone went to mobilize them individually, persuading them one by one. At the same time, the epidemic prevention team put on a play called "Wang Ersao Raising a Baby" to show that without understanding the hygiene of childbirth, six children died. This play had a great publicity effect locally. Before the women participated in the midwifery training class, there were rumors and obstacles from husbands, mothers-in-law, and sisters-in-law, but they were finally persuaded. On the first day of class, a class leader and deputy leader were elected. After discussion, the class time was set for after breakfast. The class was taught in a casual, conversational manner, guiding the students to ask questions and talk about specific situations encountered during childbirth. We didn't wait for all the students to arrive before starting; we would start with casual conversations when two or three arrived, and then begin the lesson when most of them were present. We repeated the lectures several times, and the students would automatically repeat them in their own words. If they didn't understand, they would ask questions, and the instructors would explain. Therefore, those who arrived late could still hear the lesson, and those who were busy at home could leave after hearing it once. In the evening, we held group discussions at both ends of the village, with the two instructors participating. The discussion format suited their tastes, so the instructors emphasized the evening discussions as a supplement to the daytime lectures.
    In class, we tried to avoid teaching dogmatically from textbooks and avoided using specialized terms, as this often confused the students even more. When lecturing, we first learned the local terms for physiological parts from the students, and then used these terms to explain.
    While explaining how things should be done, we also had the students talk about how old methods did it, comparing them and explaining which was correct. We also explained some scientific physiological knowledge so that the students wouldn't find it difficult to understand and would find it interesting, which was more effective than lecturing alone. The main issues discussed were as follows:
    First, lying down during childbirth will not cause "blood to cloud the mind": According to old midwifery methods, one could not lie down during childbirth, because lying down would cause "blood to cloud the mind." So, when the pregnant woman felt pain, she was told to walk back and forth on the ground, and when the pregnant woman was exhausted from walking, others would support her. She was also standing when giving birth, leaning on the edge of the bed. If no one caught the child, it would fall and break. Some used chamber pots to catch the child, and some had their heads knocked against the edge of the pot. In Hui She, there was a child in his teens who still had a dent on his head because of that. Giving birth standing up caused a lot of bleeding, and many normal births turned into difficult births as a result. If the pregnant woman ran out of energy halfway through labor, and there was no way to provide emergency care, the mother and child would easily die. In addition, if the placenta didn't come out, it was said that the placenta was stuck to the heart. When explaining, we used diagrams to show where the heart was and where the baby was, proving that the blood clots in the place where the baby was could not cloud the mind, and that the placenta could not stick to the heart.
    Second, many people still believed that during childbirth, someone had to use their knee or something else to prop up the anus, otherwise, the child might "rush out the back" – be born from the anus. This was a misunderstanding caused by tearing of the perineum. This certainly could not protect the perineum from tearing, and would increase the pain during childbirth. Some even pierced the rectum and vagina because they pushed too hard. It was necessary to explain that the "shit-holding intestine" (rectum) and the vagina were separate, and that there was no danger of the child being born from the rectum. The point was to protect the perineum with your hands to prevent it from tearing.
    Third, to explain that the scissors for cutting the umbilical cord must be disinfected, we had to explain the existence of bacteria. According to the old method, after cutting the umbilical cord, they often just tied a knot and didn't use a rope, because the knot was not tight, or the umbilical cord was cut too short, and the knot loosened again after being tightened, causing many children to bleed to death. One of the people who participated in the training had two children who died of bleeding like this.
    Fourth, according to old customs, a broken shoe had to be hung on the umbilical cord before the placenta came out, because it was said that it was to prevent the umbilical cord from shrinking. It was necessary to explain that the umbilical cord would not shrink.
    Fifth, in order to check whether the fetal position was correct (whether the head was down), it was necessary to explain that the fetus was originally head down, and only a few were head up or sideways, which would cause dystocia.
    In addition, after childbirth, the uterus contracts, and it feels like a hard lump from the outside, which was previously thought to be a blood clot, which also had to be explained.
    When explaining midwifery, superstitions were naturally dispelled at the same time. For example, explaining that if the amniotic sac breaks early, the child is born slowly; the pregnant woman stands during childbirth and exerts too much effort too early, and the physical strength is consumed too much, so the birth is slow. This dispelled the superstition that there is a certain "time" for giving birth to a child. Another example is that when a child is born, white secretions are attached to the body, which is superstitiously called "wearing mourning," which "will either kill the grandfather and grandmother or the midwife." Explaining that this is a secretion also explains that there is no need to smear the dirty blood on the child to avoid bad luck. In addition, explaining that what day or time, or giving birth in the twelfth lunar month, will ruin luck, is a superstitious statement, which is also very important. One student heard that if there was something wrong with the uterus, she would not be able to have children, and it could be checked by a doctor; she asked to be introduced to the medical team for examination because not being able to have children was not destined.
    In their studies, they used pictures to explain, used cloth models to learn midwifery, and even used vaginal speculums to actually look at the uterus. In general, the students were in high spirits during the study, and some even came to class while sick, and some did not return to their parents' home but attended class.
    This study ended successfully in seven days, and finally they were led to deliver two babies in this village. There was a pregnant woman named Yang Xiuduo, who had given birth to seven children before, but only one child survived, and the rest died of umbilical tetanus. This time, when she gave birth, our comrades went to help her deliver the baby, and it turned out to be a boy. She insisted on exchanging him for a girl with someone else, thinking that she didn't have the "fate" to raise a boy, and only exchanging him for a girl could make him grow up. However, ten days after the birth, the boy was growing fat, and she slowly believed that the child's umbilical tetanus was not a lack of fortune, but that the umbilical cord was not disinfected.
    By the end of the study, the women had even higher learning requirements. They asked a lot of questions, asking "Why do you want to eat this and that when you are pregnant?" "What should I do if the umbilical cord is wrapped around the neck?" "What should I do if the arm comes down first?" "What should I do about blood dizziness?" They asked to learn more things and to learn simple common sense about gynecological diseases. The comrades of the epidemic prevention team believed that their enthusiasm for learning was very good, and they should teach them more knowledge of midwifery, and should lead them to hold pregnancy women's forums to introduce health knowledge to pregnant women, and take them to deliver more babies to make them proficient in new methods. As for higher learning, it should be slowly professionalized, and people with a little cultural knowledge, who are not too old, and who can be cultivated for a longer period of time should be selected and concentrated for more formal training. Two or three people in a district should be trained to check fetal position and correct fetal position. Two or three people in a county should be able to deliver difficult births. In this way, the village midwives can be supported technically.
    For the village midwives to be able to carry out their work, not only technical support is important, but economic support is also very important. According to the situation in Hui She, most peasant women lie on straw after giving birth, because they are afraid of getting the quilts dirty. Their quilts are not complete, and it is difficult to put them back together after washing. Now that they are asked to lie down during childbirth, they can only lie on straw, which is easy to raise dust and can also hurt the child's skin. Therefore, the midwives should ideally have a few bed sheets and a few gray cloth bags to lend to the pregnant women. After use, the pregnant women's families will wash them and return them. In addition, gauze, sterilized cotton, alcohol, and soap are also indispensable. The midwifery fee should include all these expenses, which cannot encourage ordinary farmers to hire someone to deliver the baby even if there is no dystocia. Therefore, the district and village should ideally have medical cooperatives that can provide certain economic support to the midwives.

    回舍镇的接产训练班

    平山回舍镇的接产训练班，实际上，不是什么“班”，因为学生都是农妇。训练要不妨碍她们的家庭事务，大家既没有钟表，也没遵守时间的习惯，要想凑成一“班”就很困难。不过，这也不是个别训练，这中间多少也有些班的味道，这个训练班有学生十五名和经常的教员二名，另外忙时还有两位帮助。
    这个班的任务，规定只要教会接产婆两件事：一、如何剪脐带，保证小孩不得脐风病。二、如何保护会阴。此外就只讲讲生产时的一般卫生，使产妇不致发生产褥热。
    在开始时是先和村长妇联会接头，召开了村干部会议，报告了该村的妇女儿童疾病和死亡数目及原因（过去防疫队的统计），说明了妇婴卫生问题的重要，叫大家来协助开办这个班，并在会上讨论了学生的条件：一、有生育的或是接产的经验；二、家里不太忙，有工夫为大家服务；三、没有性病。当时就按着这三个条件提出了二十八个妇女的名子。会后大家分别去动员，一个个的说服，同时更有防疫队化装演出“王二嫂养娃娃”的戏，说明不懂得生育的卫生，养了六个孩子都死了，这戏剧在当地收了很大宣传效果。当妇女在参加接产训练班之前，谣言与丈夫、婆婆、妯娌的阻碍是有的，但终于说服了。第一天的班上选举了正副班长，经过讨论，上课的时间订为早饭后。上课是漫谈的方式，引导学生发问题和交谈一些生产中遇到的具体情况，不能等待学生到齐才讲，而是来两三个时先漫谈，大多数到了即讲课。讲的时候反复讲好些次，学生又自动的用她的话复述一遍，不明白的又问，教员又解释，因此来迟些的也能听到，家里忙的听了一遍就可以先走。到了晚上又在村子的两头开小组座谈会，两位教员均参加，座谈方式适合她们的口味，所以教员们便着重晚间的座谈，作为白日讲室的辅助。
    在上课时，尽量的避免教条的课本教法，同时避免专门名词的应用，因为这常使学生们更糊涂了。讲课时先向学生学习她们对生理部位的当地名词，而后便以此名词去讲。
    一面讲应该如何做，一面又让学员讲老法子怎么做的，把它对比，解释那个是对的，因此也一定讲些科学的生理知识，学员们才不觉得难懂，才觉得有兴趣，比单独来讲的效果好。讲的主要问题如下：
    一、躺着生不会“血迷心”：按旧接生法，生产时不能躺着，躺着就会“血迷心”。所以产妇肚子一痛，就叫在地下来回走，走得产妇乏得不得了，还叫别人架着走。生的时候也是立着，伏在炕边上生，小孩如果没有人接，就会摔坏，好些是用尿盆去接，也有头磕在盆边上磕坏的，回舍就有一个十几岁的小孩，现在头上还留着一个窝儿，就是那样磕坏的。立着生，产妇出血却是很多，很多平产因此变成了难产，生到半路产妇没有力气了，也没有救急的方法，母子就很容易死掉了。此外，衣胞不下来，过去说是衣胞沾着了心。解释时就用图来说明，心在哪里，盛孩子的地方在哪里，证明盛孩子地方的瘀血迷不了心；衣胞也沾不到心上。
    二、很多地方的人还相信，生产时一定要别人用膝盖或别的东西顶住肛门，否则，小孩就可能“奔后”——由肛门生出来。这是由撕破会阴产生的一种误会，这当然不能保护会阴不破，还会增加生产时的痛苦，有的还因顶的太猛，凿穿了直肠和阴道。这就要解释“盛屎的肠”（直肠）和阴道各是一路，小孩决没有从直肠生出来的危险。问题是要用手保护会阴，免得它撕破。
    三、为了说明剪脐带的剪刀要消毒，就要说明细菌的存在。旧法剪脐带以后，常只挽一个疙瘩，不用绳子札，因为挽得不紧，或是脐带剪短了，挽紧了又松开，小孩因此流血流死的很多。参加学习的一个人，她有两个小孩就是这样流血死了的。
    四、旧的习惯，衣胞没生下来时，脐带上要坠一只破鞋，说是怕脐带缩进去。这就要说明脐带是不会收缩的。
    五、为了检查胎位正不正（是不是头朝下），就要解释胎儿原来就是头朝下的，只有少数是头朝上或横着，那样就会形成难产。
    另外，生产以后子宫收缩，从外面摸起来是一个硬块，过去以为这是瘀血块，这也要解释。
    在讲接生法时，很自然的也同时破除了迷信。比如说明衣胞破的早了，小孩生的慢，产妇立着生，努劲太早，体力消耗大了生的就慢，这就破除了生小孩都有一定“时辰”的迷信。又如小孩生下时，身上沾了白色分泌物，迷信的叫这是“穿孝”、“不妨死爷娘就要妨死接生的人”，解释了这是分泌物，也就说明了不必把污血去抹在小孩身上，来避晦气。此外解释什么日子时辰，正腊月间接生会冲坏运气，是迷信的说法，也很重要。有一个学员听了子宫有了什么病，就不会生小孩，并且可以由医生检查出来；不生小孩不是命里注定，她就要求介绍她到医疗组去检查。
    她们的学习中，用了图画讲解，用了布做的模型学接生，还让她们用阴道镜实际的看了看子宫。学习中学生一般的情绪都很高，甚至还有带病来上课的，还有不回娘家而听课的。
    这个学习在七天内就胜利结束了，最后还领着她们在本村接了两次生。里面有一个产妇叫杨秀朵，她以前生过七胎了，可是只活了一个孩子，其余都是脐风死了。这一次生孩子，我们同志去帮她接，接下来是个小子，她非要跟别人换一个闺女不可，以为没有“命”养小子，只有换个闺女才能成人。可是生下以后十天过去了，那小子长的胖胖的，她才慢慢相信小孩发脐风，不是什么没福命，确是剪脐带没消毒的过。
    到学习结束时，那些妇女们的学习要求更高了，她们提了一大堆问题，问“为什么怀上孩子就想吃这个那个？”“脐带绕着脖子了怎么办？”“胳膊先下来怎么办？”“血晕怎么办？”她们要求讲更多的东西，要求学妇科病的简单常识。防疫队的同志认为她们的这种学习热情是很好的，应该再多给她们教些接产的知识，应该领导她们去召开孕妇座谈会，给孕妇介绍卫生知识，带着她们多接产，使她们熟练新方法。至于更高一点的学习，则要慢慢的使它专业化，要选择略有文化知识，年龄不太大，能够作较长期培养的人，集中起来作比较正规的训练。一个区里面培养两三个能检查胎位，能矫正胎位的。一个县里面有两三个能接难产的。这样从技术上去支援村里的接生员。
    要村里的接生员能展开工作，不但要有技术的支援，经济上的支援也很重要。按回舍的情形来讲，一般农妇生产以后都躺在秆草上，因为怕弄脏了被子，他们被子不是囫囵的，拆开一洗很难再拚到一起，现在要她们生产时躺着，那也只有躺在秆草上，秆草容易起灰尘，也会扎伤小孩的皮肤。所以接生员最好能备有几床卧单，几个灰布袋，借给产妇去用。用后由产妇家里洗净归还。另外，纱布、消毒棉花、酒精、肥皂也少不得要用一些。在接产费里面要包括这全部开支，这就不能鼓励一般农民在没有发生难产时也请人接生，所以区村最好有医药合作社，能给接生员一定的经济支援。
