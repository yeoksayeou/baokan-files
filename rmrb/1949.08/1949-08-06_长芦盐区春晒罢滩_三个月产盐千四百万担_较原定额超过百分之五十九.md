    Changlu Salt District Spring Salt Harvesting Completed
    Three-Month Output Reaches 14 Million Dan, Exceeding Original Quota by Over 59 Percent
    [This newspaper reports] The Fengcai (Tanggu) and Lutai (Hangu) salt fields in the Changlu Salt District suffered considerable damage to their facilities during the Tianjin-Tanggu liberation war before the Kuomintang bandit troops were eliminated. Since liberation and takeover, great achievements have been made in the past three months due to the resolute implementation of the correct policy of rapidly restoring and developing production.
    The original plan was: Hangu 5 million dan, Tangda 4 million dan (including Tanggu, Dagu, Xinhe, and Denggu salt fields), and Daqing River 500,000 dan (Huanghua originally belonged to the Shandong Bureau and was recently placed under the administration of the Changlu District, so there was no predetermined output). The spring salt harvesting work began in each field on April 14th of this year, and now, due to the rainy season, all salt harvesting was stopped on July 14th. The achievements in the spring salt harvest during these three months are significant. As of early July, the salt production of each field is as follows: Hangu 7,021,980 dan, Tanggu 1,400,795 dan, Dagu 3,836,000 dan, Xinhe 900,665 dan, Denggu 1,148,938 dan, Daqing River 547,660 dan, and Huanghua 83,851 dan. The total salt production is 14,920,207 dan, exceeding the original plan by a total of 5,336,354 dan, accounting for 59.29 percent of the original plan.
    The reasons for the above glorious achievements are threefold: (1) Because of correct leadership and management, the Changlu Salt Affairs Administration formulated a correct salt affairs policy and production plan this year, and all management measures were carried out in coordination with the production plan. In particular, the establishment of the "over-quota bonus system" further boosted the production enthusiasm of all salt field workers and stove households, and achieved the expected results. (2) Due to the efforts of salt affairs cadres at all levels, salt affairs cadres at all levels were able to concretely implement the salt affairs policy and production plan, especially the work cadres in the salt fields, who used practical actions to influence and drive workers and stove households to work hard together to produce. (3) The working class in the salt fields has raised its awareness and changed its attitude towards labor.

    长芦盐区春晒罢滩
    三个月产盐千四百万担
    较原定额超过百分之五十九
    【本报讯】长芦盐区的丰财（塘沽）、芦台（汉沽）两场，在津塘解放战争中，国民党匪军被消灭以前，对两场的设备都有相当破坏。自解放接管后，由于坚决执行了迅速恢复和发展生产的正确方针，三个月来，已获得很大成绩。
    原订计划：汉沽五百万担，塘大四百万担（包括塘沽、大沽、新河、邓沽四场），大清河五十万担（黄骅原属山东局，最近才划归长芦区管理，故无预定产额），以上共计九百五十万担，各场自本年四月十四日起开始春晒工作，现在因为到了雨季时期，故于七月十四日全部罢滩停止晒盐。在这三个月的春晒盐斤所获成绩甚大。截至七月上旬，各场产盐数量计：汉沽七百零二十一万九千九百八十担，塘沽一百四十万零七千九百九十五担，大沽三百八十三万六千担，新河九十万零六千一百六十五担，邓沽一百十四万八千九百三十八担，大清河五十四万七千六百六十担，黄骅八万三千八百五十一担。总计产盐一千四百九十二万零二百零七担，总计超产五百三十三万六千三百五十四担。占原定计划百分之五十九点二九。
    所以能有以上光荣成绩原因有三：（一）因为有正确的领导和管理，长芦盐务管理局本年拟定了正确的盐务政策及生产计划，而管理方面一切措施，都是围绕着生产计划配合进行。尤其“超额分红制”的建立，更鼓起全体盐场工人和灶户的生产情绪高涨，而收到预期的效果。（二）由于各级盐务干部的努力结果，各级盐务干部能把盐务政策和生产计划，具体的贯彻执行，尤其盐滩的工作干部，拿实际行动去影响带动工人和灶户一致努力生产。（三）盐场工人阶级觉悟提高，和劳动态度的改变。
