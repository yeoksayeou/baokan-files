  　Youth Academy Students Busy Preparing for Graduation, Beijing Normal University Students Continue to Discuss Study Group Reports
    ▲ Today (the 18th), the Academy will hold a graduation ceremony, and the Fifth District will also hold a sports meet. The location has been decided as the Huiwen High School playground. Because the playground is covered with weeds and many ditches, the Recreation Division of the Southeast District of the Academy held another "Half-Day Labor" on the afternoon of the 15th at 2:00 PM. With the active work of the students, the playground was given a new look in two hours.

    ▲ The Summer Youth Academy is scheduled to end today (the 18th). The Northeast District of the Academy held the last Youth Lecture on the 16th. The Northeast District Office awarded various prizes on the spot: three large red flags for the championship of the ball game, and prizes (books) for the second essay contest of the Academic Arts Division. It was also announced that nearly one hundred students who have been enthusiastic in their service will receive commemorative badges. During the two half-day labor sessions, because every student worked so actively and tensely, without any slackness, each school was given a certificate of merit, with comments according to the characteristics of their labor, such as "organized and disciplined" for the Provincial Middle School, "unity and mutual assistance" for the Hui Middle School...etc. In the song "We Workers Have Strength," representatives from each school held their colorful certificates of merit and took pictures on the stage as a souvenir. (Zhu Rongji)
    ▲ The Central District of the Youth Academy held a forum yesterday (the 17th), attended by more than thirty students from eleven schools, including the Fourth Middle School, the First Girls' Middle School, and Chengda. They first raised many opinions on the work of the Academy. When talking about the gains after entering the Academy, more than thirty students spoke enthusiastically. They unanimously believed that they had undergone significant changes in their ideological viewpoints and lifestyles after entering the Academy. They said, "We have made a lot of progress this summer." They felt that the Youth Lecture was particularly helpful to them. They hoped that "Youth Lectures" could continue to be held every week in the future, and even hoped to spend the Academy life again during future vacations.

    ▲ After the students of the Beiping Municipal Normal School of the Third Branch of the Summer Study Group returned to school, the students automatically re-divided themselves into groups, formulated their own outlines, continued to discuss the unfinished reports, and participated in various activities such as the Youth Lecture and Choir of the Northwest District Youth Academy.

  　青年学园同学准备结业一片忙北师同学继续讨论学习团报告
    ▲今天（十八日）学园就要举行结业式，五区并要开一次运动会，地点已决定在汇文大操场。因该大操场遍生野草，水沟很多，所以学园东南区康乐股在十五日下午二时又举办了一次“半日劳动”。在同学积极工作下，两个钟头内，便使操场面目一新。

    ▲暑期青年学园定于今（十八日）结束。十六日学园东北区举行最后一次青年讲座。东北区办事处当场颁发了各种奖品：球赛冠军的三面大红旗，学艺股第二次征文的奖品（书籍）。并宣布近一百位热心服务的同学将获得纪念章。两次半日劳动中，由于每一位同学都是那样积极紧张的劳动，没有一个松懈，所以每校发给一张奖状，按照他们劳动的特点给以评语，如省中的是“有组织有纪律”，惠中的是“团结互助”……等。在“咱们工人有力量”歌声中，各校代表捧着花绿奖状，在讲台上留影纪念。（朱熔基）
    ▲青年学园中心区昨（十七日）举行座谈会，到四中、女一中、成达等十一个学校的三十余位同学。他们首先对学园的工作提出了许多意见，在谈到入学园后的收获时，三十几位同学踊跃地发言，他们一致认为入学园后在思想观点上，在生活作风上都有了重大的转变。他们说：“这暑期得到进步真不少。”他们感到青年讲座对他们的帮助特别大。希望以后每周还能继续举行“青年讲座”，更希望以后的假期能再过学园的生活。

    ▲暑期学习团第三分团北平市立师范同学回校后，同学自动重新划分了小组，自己拟定提纲，继续讨论没有讨论完的报告，并且参加西北区青年学园的青年讲座和歌咏队等各种活动。（北师通讯组）
