    The Correct Path to Resolving Labor Disputes
    On the Collective Labor Contract of the Beiping National Pharmaceutical Industry

    After two and a half months of deliberation, discussion, drafting, agreement, and final revision, the Collective Labor Contract of the Beiping National Pharmaceutical Industry has been approved and promulgated by the Labor Bureau. This is the first collective labor contract in Beiping since liberation, and a good start for workers and capitalists in Beiping to establish correct labor-capital relations under the people's democratic government, based on the New Democratic economic policy.

    Before liberation, many workers in the Beiping National Pharmaceutical Industry were forced to endure various super-economic exploitations and feudal management oppression by capitalists for a long time. In addition to food and lodging provided by the capitalists, the wages in the National Pharmaceutical Industry were generally based on a percentage of sales revenue. Before liberation, some were as low as 10 percent, and some capitalists even tried every means to deduct wages from such low percentages, even deducting the expenses of the capitalists' families and even the cost of offerings to the Buddha from the wage percentage. This made some workers unable to earn even 20 kilograms of millet for a month's hard work. At the same time, the human rights of many workers were unreasonably violated. Upon entering a pharmacy, they were forced to change their names or surnames, subjected to beatings and scolding, and faced high-pressure tactics if they made any reasonable demands. During the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, some workers were arrested by the puppet police station for being labeled as "connected to the Eighth Route Army" for planning to establish a trade union. Due to the above reasons, after the liberation of Beiping, the workers in the National Pharmaceutical Industry had very high resistance emotions and put forward many demands, many of which were reasonable and should be met; but some were unreasonable and should not be met, and some capitalists, feeling guilty and not understanding the policies, accepted all workers' demands, regardless of whether they were reasonable or unreasonable. As a result, the wage percentage sometimes suddenly increased from 10 percent to more than 40 percent, making it unprofitable or even causing losses, while workers with low wages still demanded to be on par with those with high wages, leading to endless labor-capital disputes. At the same time, within the scope of business, some capitalists could not command workers, and some workers excessively interfered with administration. Therefore, capitalists were unwilling to actively produce, which greatly affected the production and operation of the National Pharmaceutical Industry, which was extremely unfavorable to both labor and capital.

    We believe that although workers and capitalists have fundamental contradictions, they also have a basis for unity and cooperation under today's conditions. This basis is "developing production and benefiting both labor and capital." Only in this spirit can the correct relationship between labor and capital be established at this stage. The Collective Labor Contract of the National Pharmaceutical Industry embodies this spirit. Looking at the entire contract, compared with before liberation, the wage percentage has increased from 10-20 percent to 20-30 percent, the workers' vacation system has changed from uncertain to fixed at four days per month, and the daily working hours have also been slightly shortened, and fixed at 11 to 13 hours (before liberation, some were as long as 15 hours). All of these are beneficial to the workers and are necessary to improve the workers' labor enthusiasm; at the same time, the capitalists' reasonable profits and the right to command business management are equally recognized and guaranteed. This is beneficial to both labor and capital, and it is the necessary prerequisite for developing production.

    The provision on wages in the contract stipulates that in addition to the minimum food and lodging provided by the capitalists, all wages are based on a percentage of sales revenue, making the workers' lives very closely related to the capitalists' business performance, which easily paralyzes the workers' class consciousness and makes the workers' lives unstable. This method will result in workers with the same or similar skills receiving wages that differ by as much as three or four times for selling the same amount of labor, which is not reasonable; it is reasonable for workers in some smaller pharmacies with poor business to demand fixed wages. However, taking into account the habits of the National Pharmaceutical Industry, and because the industry and commerce that benefit the national economy and people's livelihood are still very underdeveloped, this is only a temporary measure to enable capitalists to have a certain profit to make, so as to vigorously develop production. But in the future, when industry and commerce have achieved a certain degree of development, this percentage wage system should be abolished and a fixed wage system should be adopted.

    Some workers whose wage percentage increased to more than 30 percent after liberation may be dissatisfied with the current contract. Because the income ratio stipulated in the contract has decreased, we believe that excessively high wages, although temporarily beneficial to the workers, may make it unprofitable or even cause losses to the capitalists, prevent production from developing, and may lead to the closure of shops, which in turn makes it impossible for the workers' lives to be further improved, and may even threaten them with unemployment. However, we do not object if the capitalists voluntarily give wages higher than 30 percent, and voluntarily earn less or no profit.

    Experience has proven that it is correct and necessary to allow both workers and capitalists to fully express their demands and opinions during the contract negotiation process. It should be admitted that some trade union comrades did not have enough understanding of this point when the Collective Labor Contract of the National Pharmaceutical Industry was first drafted. They worried that the capitalists would stubbornly pursue a single-profit policy as in the past, and they were even more worried that the workers would make too high demands. As a result, the workers' demands were not well reflected, causing worker dissatisfaction and taking some detours. Because this shortcoming was corrected in time, both workers and capitalists were able to conduct full deliberation and discussion, and were able to fully express their demands and opinions through the workers' representative meeting and the capitalists' trade association, and repeatedly debated and negotiated on an equal footing: in some places the workers made concessions, and in some places the capitalists made concessions, finally enabling the contract to achieve results that both parties could be satisfied with. We welcome the use of this equal and voluntary negotiation method to resolve labor disputes; we approve of workers making demands on capitalists, and capitalists can also make demands on workers; workers can conduct legal struggles against capitalists, and capitalists can also conduct legal struggles against workers. But the purpose of all of this should be to develop production. If capitalists do not do this, but adopt passive resistance measures, such as only selling and not buying, secretly withdrawing capital, etc., then it is illegal and will be sanctioned.

    Today, now that the contract has been promulgated and implemented, we hope that both labor and capital can strictly abide by it, and that neither party should unilaterally violate it and cause losses to the other party. But this does not mean that any supplements and revisions are not allowed. Because this is a collective contract for all workers and capitalists in the National Pharmaceutical Industry, each pharmacy must have more specific regulations in order to implement it. However, these specific regulations cannot violate the overall spirit. If individual places need to be modified, as long as labor and capital agree and the Labor Bureau approves, it is also possible.

    The capitalists hoped to specifically stipulate the labor discipline in the contract, and there were too many restrictions on the workers. The workers did not approve, and we also think it is unnecessary, because this belongs to the scope of business management. Now, the capitalists have changed to formulating shop rules separately outside the contract, and the shop rules will be promulgated and implemented as an annex to the contract after being approved by the trade union and the Labor Bureau, which should be an acceptable method for both parties.

    Today, the labor-capital relationship in the National Pharmaceutical Industry has been initially and correctly resolved due to the promulgation of the collective contract, thus providing a favorable condition for the smooth development of the National Pharmaceutical Industry. The main problem in the future is how to expand production, open up sales channels, so as to further develop business and improve the status of labor and capital. We expect both labor and capital in the National Pharmaceutical Industry to bravely move towards this goal.

    Some other private industries in Beiping are brewing and drafting collective contracts, while others are not yet prepared. We hope that they can all formulate collective contracts and resolve labor disputes as quickly as the National Pharmaceutical Industry, so as to concentrate all efforts to fight for the restoration and development of production in Beiping.

    解决劳资纠纷的正确途径
    论北平国药业劳资集体合同
    经过两个半月的酝酿、讨论、起草、协议和最后修正，北平市国药业劳资集体合同已由劳动局批准公布了。这是北平市解放后第一个劳资集体合同，是北平市工人和资本家，在人民民主政权之下，根据新民主主义的经济政策，建立正确的劳资关系的一个良好的开始。
    解放前，北平市国药业很多工人，曾经长期被迫忍受资方种种超经济的剥削和封建性管理的压迫。国药业工资除食宿由资方供给外，一般按照买卖流水提成，解放前有的低至百分之十，而有些资方还千方百计地从这样低的提成数里克扣工资，连资方一家人的开消，甚至柜上买佛供的耗费，都从工资提成数里扣除。使有些工人辛劳一月还挣不到二十斤小米。同时，有很多工人的人权竟遭受无理的摧残，一进药铺就被迫改名或换姓，打骂交加，偶或提出任何合理要求，则横遭高压，在国民党反动统治时期有的工人因为酝酿成立工会，被资方说成“通八路”而抓到伪警察局去。由于上述原因，北平解放后，国药业工人反抗情绪非常高涨，提出了许多要求，其中有许多是合理的，应该的；但也有些是不合理的，不应该的，而有的资本家自己心虚，又不了解政策，对于工人要求，不管合理不合理，通通接受。结果工资提成有的从百分之十突然增至百分之四十以上，以致无利可图，甚至亏本，而工资低的工人则仍要求向高的看齐，劳资纠纷此落彼起，同时在业务范围内，有些资方指挥不了工人，有的工人过分干涉行政。因此资本家不愿积极生产，使国药业的生产与营业遭受很大影响，对于劳资双方，都极为不利。
    我们认为，工人和资本家，虽有根本矛盾，但在今天的条件下，却也有团结合作的基础。这个基础就是“发展生产，劳资两利”，只有本着这个精神，劳资间在现阶段的正确关系才有可能建立。国药业劳资集体合同，就是掌握了这个精神的。统观全部合同，较之解放前，工资提成从百分之十到二十增至百分之二十到三十，工人的休假制度从不确定到确定为每月四天，每天工作时间也稍为短了一些，而且固定为十一小时至十三小时（解放前有多至十五小时的），这都是对工人有利的，也是提高工人的劳动情绪所必需的；同时对于资方合理利润和业务管理的指挥权，一样地也给予承认和保障。这就是劳资两利，也就是发展生产所必须的前提。
    合同中关于工资的规定，除由资方供给起码的食宿外，全部按流水提成，使工人生活与资方营业的好坏发生非常密切的关系，容易麻痹工人的阶级觉悟，并使工人生活动荡不安。这种办法将使同等技术或技术相差不多的工人出卖同等劳力的结果，所得工资会相差到三倍乃至四倍之多，这是不会合理的；有些规模较小，营业较差的药铺工人，因此要求采取固定工资是有理由的。但因顾及国药业的习惯，又因现在有利国计民生的工商业还很不发展，为了使资方有一定的利润可图，以便大力发展生产，所以暂时只好这样做。但在将来工商业获得一定程度的发展时，就应该废除这种提成的工资制度，而采取固定工资制度。
    有些解放后工资提成提高到百分之三十以上的工人，可能会对现在的合同不满。因为按合同规定的收入比例是减少了，我们认为工资过高，对工人暂时虽有好处，但却可能使资方无利可图乃至亏本，生产不能发展，店铺可能倒闭，因而也使工人生活不可能进一步改善，甚至可能遭受失业的威胁。但如资方自愿给予高于百分之三十以上的工资，自愿少赚钱或不赚钱，我们也不反对。
    经验证明：在合同协商过程中，放手让工人和资本家都能充分提出自己的要求和意见，是正确的，必须的。应该承认：在国药业劳资集体合同开始拟订时，有些工会同志对这一点的认识是不够的。他们耽心资方会象过去一样顽固地追求着单利政策，更耽心工人会提出太高的要求，结果工人的要求不能很好的反映出来，引起工人不满，走了一些弯路。由于这一缺点得到及时的纠正，使工人和资本家都能进行充分的酝酿和讨论，而且都能通过职工代表会议和资本家的同业公会充分提出自己的要求和意见，并在平等基础上，反复辩驳协商：有些地方工人让了步，有些地方资本家让了步，终于使合同获得双方都能满意的结果。我们欢迎用这种平等自愿协商的方式来解决劳资纠纷；我们赞成工人向资本家提出要求，资本家也可向工人提出要求；工人可向资本家进行合法斗争，资本家也可向工人进行合法斗争。但其目的都应该是为了发展生产。如果资本家不这样做，而采取消极抵抗，如光卖不买、暗抽资本等等办法，则是违法的，是要受到制裁的。
    今天合同既经公布施行，我们希望劳资双方都能严格遵守，任何一方面不得片面违背而使对方蒙受损失。但这并不是说任何补充和修改都是不许可的，由于这是全体国药业劳资的集体合同，各药铺必须有更具体的规定，才好执行。不过这些具体规定不能违背总的精神。如果有个别地方需要修改的话，只要劳资双方同意并经劳动局批准，也是可以的。
    资本家希望把劳动纪律具体地在合同中规定出来，对工人限制太多，工人不赞成，我们也认为不必要，因为这是属于业务管理范围的。现在，改由资方在合同之外，另行拟定铺规，经工会同意和劳动局批准，作为合同的附件公布施行，应该是双方都能接受的一个办法。
    今天国药业劳资关系，已因集体合同的公布而获得初步的正确的解决，并因此为国药业的顺利发展提供了一个有利的条件。今后的主要问题就是如何扩大生产，打开销路，以进一步发展业务，改善劳资地位。我们期待着国药业的劳资双方都能勇敢的朝着这一目标前进。
    北平市其他私营行业，有的正在酝酿和草拟集体合同，有的则尚无此准备，我们希望都能象国药业一样，迅速地拟定集体合同，解决劳资纠纷，以便集中全力，为恢复与发展北平市的生产而奋斗。
