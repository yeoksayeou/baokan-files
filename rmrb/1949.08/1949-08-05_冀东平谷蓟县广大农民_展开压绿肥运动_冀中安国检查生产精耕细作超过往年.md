[Report from this Newspaper] Farmers in Pinggu, Jixian, and other counties are busily cutting and pressing green manure. Under the specific leadership of county and district cadres, farmers in Pinggu have already cut and pressed a large amount of green manure. In mid-July alone, they pressed over 3 million catties of fertilizer in ten days, with District Four pressing over 887,700 catties. Since July, the mountain people in Districts Eight, Twelve, Six, and Nine of Jixian County have pressed a large quantity of green fertilizer. To solve the fertilizer problem for families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and impoverished orphans in the coming year, the county branch of the People's Bank is providing 5,000 catties of millet in loans for pressing fertilizer, which will be distributed to 34 villages including Yaopu and Linhe in District Twelve. It is estimated that this loan of grain can buy 250,000 catties of Vitex negundo (荆条), which can be mixed with soil to press 1 million catties of fertilizer, solving the fertilizer problem for over 1,000 mu of land. The masses in Beiying Village, Shunyi, have also proposed a "manure accumulation campaign" to ensure increased fertilizer application and increased production in the coming year.

[Report from this Newspaper] The An'guo County Party Committee Production Inspection Team conducted an in-depth inspection of Dongliwangzhuang and Changzhuang in District Seven, which proved that the majority of farmers have improved their intensive farming, meticulous cultivation, and fertilizer accumulation compared to previous years.

In Dongliwangzhuang and Changzhuang villages, weeding has broken the past habit of only weeding three times. Fertilizer accumulation has also increased significantly compared to last year. In Dongliwangzhuang village, the number of pigs raised last year was 144, and this year it has increased by 77. All ten broken waterwheels out of the village's twenty have been completely repaired this year. Regarding fertilizer accumulation, according to a survey of eleven households in the two villages, a total of 63 pens of fertilizer were accumulated last year, while this year, in just half a year, 53 pens have already been accumulated. Wang Dayu, a poor peasant in Dongliwangzhuang village, has risen to the status of a middle peasant due to his diligence and thrift in production. Last year, he accumulated seven pens of fertilizer, and this year he has already accumulated five pens in half a year. He applied 50 cartloads of manure to his 1.5 mu of paddy fields, 60 cartloads of manure to his 2 mu of dry land, and 50 catties of soybean cake to his 1.5 mu of corn for green manure. He also applied 80 catties of soybean cake to his 1.5 mu of millet. In the paddy fields, he also applied 60 cartloads of soil from demolished houses. To prevent wind damage, they built windbreak walls on five mu of land by making their own bricks. In addition, he partnered with others to buy a waterwheel, and he also bought a locust tree to prepare to build another large cart. He happily said, "This year's situation will improve by 30% compared to last year."

    冀东平谷蓟县广大农民
    展开压绿肥运动
    冀中安国检查生产精耕细作超过往年
    【本报讯】平谷、蓟县等地农民，正紧张地割压绿肥。平谷农民在县区干部具体领导下，已割压出大量绿肥；仅七月中旬十天内即压肥达三百余万斤，只四区即压出八十八万七千七百多斤。蓟县八、十二、六、九等区山地群众，自七月开始已压出大批青肥。该县人民银行支行为解决烈军工属及贫困孤寡来年肥料问题，特举办压肥贷粮小米五千斤，分别贷予十二区姚铺、淋河等三十四个村。占计此项贷粮，可买荆条二十五万斤，混土后可压肥一百万斤，能解决千余亩地肥料问题。顺义北营村群众亦提出“一圈肥运动”，保证来年加肥增产。
    【本报讯】安国县委生产检查团，深入七区东李王庄和常庄检查的结果，证明大部农民，精耕细作积肥揽青，都比往年提高了一步。
    东李王庄和常庄两村，锄地已打破了过去只锄三遍的习惯；积肥也比去年增加了很多。东李王庄村，去年养猪一百四十四口，今年增加了七十七口。全村二十辆水车内的十辆破的，今年也完全修理好了。在积肥方面，据该两村十一户的调查：去年共积肥六十三圈，今年只半年就积了五十三圈。东李王庄贫农王大雨，由于勤俭生产，现已上升为中农。去年他积肥七圈，今年半年已经积了五圈。他的一亩半水地，上了五十车粪，二亩旱地上了六十车粪，一亩半棒子揽青用了豆饼五十斤，一亩半谷子施了豆饼八十斤；水地里还上了拆房土六十车。为了预防风灾，他们自己打坯垒了五亩地的防风墙。另外他并与别人合伙买了一辆水车，自己又买了一裸槐树，准备再打一辆大车。他愉快地说：“今年的光景能比去年提高三成。”
