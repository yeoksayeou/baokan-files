　　Part One Night
　　Chapter One Danilov
    Danilov walked through the entire train himself. In reality, it was probably all in order everywhere. At least, that’s how he felt. Perhaps some places weren’t entirely clear. For example, what was the purpose of that zinc box with a lid and two compartments in the kitchen car? The box had a faucet, a small cabinet, and hooks. Danilov stood there for a long time, wondering what the box was for. He called the quartermaster, Su Bao, to discuss it. They guessed it must be for washing cups and dishes.
    People began to board the train. The train was becoming occupied. Trucks loaded with mattresses, bedding, and medicine arrived. Danilov and Su Bao counted, checked, and instructed where to place things. The wound dressing nurse, Yuli, diligently carried rolls of bandages and cotton wool to the pharmacy car. The pharmacist spilled iodine on the small table. So she and Yuli immediately put on white coats and tied white handkerchiefs around their heads—as if they couldn't enter the pharmacy car without wearing the coats. The fireman was trying to start a fire, having stolen some coal from the station. The nurses were making beds, singing, and gazing at a handsome Lieutenant Bagchuk. Quartermaster Su Bao, Bagchuk, and the others went to the grain station to collect military rations. Little Lina, with a bag of rice on her shoulder, walked briskly at the front.
    Danilov ordered that the rice, curd, chocolate, and cream be locked up in one place. He ordered his entire team to cook millet porridge.
    The ambulance train headed to the front line. The train moved slowly from station to station, stopping for half a day at desolate small stations. Trains carrying Red Army soldiers, tanks, and artillery sped past the ambulance train. It yielded the way to those trains and then followed leisurely behind.
    Arriving at a station, it stopped on a remote, quiet track. People ran around on the platform, bidding farewell, arguing, kissing, crying, waving handkerchiefs… When this beautiful, clean ambulance train, painted with beautiful red crosses and hung with white window curtains, passed by, they watched it in mournful silence.
    On the night described at the beginning of this chapter, this ambulance train approached Pskov.
    Danilov walked through the command car, inspected it, and returned. Suddenly, a violent jolt threw him to one side. His shoulder hit the corner of the upper berth. The sound of wheels rattled. The train stopped.
    "What happened?" a woman's voice asked loudly in the darkness.
    "What happened?" Danilov said, leaning out of the car in the darkness.
    The train guard walked along the train, waving a hand lamp.
    "Red light," he explained, and walked on. "The road is blocked."
    The light of a searchlight burst forth again. Against the background of the true night, it was dazzlingly bright. It silently traced a white line across the black sky, swaying slowly from side to side, searching, but finding nothing.
　　Chapter Two Lina
    Lina got married ten months before the outbreak of the war.
    A grand review of recreational performances was held in a suburban village. Among the singers, dancers, and reciters, the village tumbler was also supposed to perform his act. The district sports association sent Lina to participate in the review.
    The public utilities bureau prepared a truck. Lina sat on the uncomfortable, dusty bench at the back of the truck. On the benches on either side sat some unfamiliar comrades from other organizations.
    These unfamiliar people were all wearing leather jackets and raincoats, carrying briefcases. Lina was wearing a blue undershirt, which she had narrowed at the waist to make her figure look better. She had rolled up her sleeves to her elbows. Now she wanted to let her sleeves down, to the same length as her fingers, but she was embarrassed to. She sat alone, far away from everyone, and was bounced up and down every time the truck jolted. Her short hair fluttered on her face.
    The men were talking loudly, laughing at something. They didn't pay attention to Lina.
    The weather was very sultry. Thin purple clouds crawled up from behind the horizon, rising and covering half the sky, and before they even had time to cover the sun, a torrential rain came down. The rain in front of her was like a wall of water. Rainwater flowed like rivers from Lina's head and back, and her blue undershirt, skirt, and short hair were soaked through in an instant. The men covered their heads with their coats and raincoats, shouting something. The driver sat indifferently in his tightly closed cab. Lina thought like a wet hen: "They are all so rude!"
    Suddenly, a man stood up. Without taking off his coat from his head, he bent over and sat down next to Lina.
    "Come on, let's do this!" he said, and used the edge of his leather coat to cover her head.
    She felt as if they were huddled together in a narrow tent. She had to shrink herself to hide properly. The heavy rain beat on the coat.
    She was so wet and cold that she didn't feel restrained at all. She was only angry that the rescuer had come so late; how long did it take him to guess, the fool!
    Her head rested on his chest. She glanced down and saw only the tightly drawn, heavy, canvas-like wet skirt, the closely pressed wet knees, and the plaid coat lining.
    Suddenly, she heard a slow tapping sound in her ear. It was his heart beating. It was his heart!
    She was surprised and listened. Really, at first the heart wasn't beating, that is to say, of course it was beating, but it was beating normally, without any sound. But now it was beating wildly.
    Why was his heart beating like this?
    She wanted to see his face. Because she didn't know what kind of person he was. If his heart wasn't beating like this, maybe he would be like this, or it would be best to tell his heart not to beat? No, no matter what he looked like, let his heart beat.
    His heart was beating.
    She wanted it to be brighter, so she didn't move and used two fingers to carefully pry open a small slit in the tent-like coat, and carefully turned her head to glance at his face from below.
    His face was gloomy, frowning, and uneasy. A pair of black eyes looked down at Lina.
    She quickly lowered her head and didn't look up again. At this moment, under the tent-like leather coat, there were already two hearts beating.
    She closed her eyes, listening to this storm—the storm in her heart and his.
    A fiery whirlwind rose in her heart—shame, shameful joy, pride, surprise, and revelry.
    The rain stopped, and he stood up.
    "Okay," he said with a somewhat bewildered smile. "It seems we have arrived… but you sit still, sit like this now!" he immediately added, putting the coat on her shoulders. "You'll catch a cold..."
    But, sitting here alone, she felt very depressed. So she took off the coat and wrung out the water from the hem of her skirt. The sun was shining again. The water in the truck was ankle-deep. It gave off a smell of wet soil, wet buckwheat, wet mugwort—what refreshing air. Her face was also excellent. And the best thing was the rain, but why did it stop so quickly? It should have kept falling and falling. (To be continued)

　　第一部　夜
　　第一章　达尼洛夫
    达尼洛夫自己在全车里走了一遍。实际上大概处处全是井井有条的。至少他觉得是这样的。简或有些地方不大了然。譬如说，厨车上那个带盖的，分成两隔的锌质的箱子是干吗呢。箱子上有水龙头，小橱架和钩子。达尼洛夫站在那儿想了好半天，这箱子是干吗用的呢。他把军需官苏葆叫来商量着。他俩猜想着这一定是洗杯盘用的。
    人们都开始上车了。车上都住人了。满载着褥子，被单和药品的卡车都来了。达尼洛夫同苏葆清点着，检查着，吩咐着什么东西安置到什么地方。裹伤看护尤丽，勤谨的把一卷卷的绷带和药棉花往药车上抱着。药剂师把碘酒洒到小桌上了。于是她和尤丽马上穿上白色的衣罩，头上扎着白手帕，——于是觉得不穿衣罩就不能进药车似的。司炉在试着生火，由车站上偷了些煤来。女看护们在铺着床，唱着歌，望着一个英俊的少尉包格秋克。军需官苏葆和包克秋克及其余的人，一块到粮站上去领军粮去了。小个的琳娜肩上背着一袋米，挺着身子，轻快的在顶前边走着。
    达尼洛夫吩咐叫把米，凝乳，巧克力和奶油，单锁到一个地方。对自己的全体同人，他吩咐叫煮黍子粥吃。
    救护车往前线开去了。车子慢慢儿一站一站的开着；成半天在荒凉的小站上停着。载着红军兵士，坦克和大炮的列车，由救护车跟前赶过去。它给那些列车让着路，然后不慌不忙的一直跟在后面开去。
    到车站上就停在远远的僻静的轨道上。月台上人都乱跑着，离别着，吵着，吻着，哭着，挥着手帕……当这一列漂亮，清洁，漆着美丽的红十字，挂着白色窗幔的救护车，从人面前开过的时候，他们在悲伤的沉默里望着它。
    在本章开始所写的那一夜，这列救护车开近了普斯科夫。
    达尼洛夫穿过了司令车，巡视了一番回来。突然猛烈的一撞，把他摔到一边去了。他的肩撞到上铺的床角上。车轮声喳喳的响起来。车停了。
    “怎么一回事？”一个女人的嗓音，高声的在黑暗中问着。
    “怎么一回事？”达尼洛夫在黑暗中从车里伸出身子说。
    车守顺着车跟前走着，摆着手灯。
    “红灯，”他解释着，走了过去。“路塞起来了。”
    探照灯的光芒，又迸射出来了。在此刻的真正的夜的背景上，它是眩惑人目的明亮。它无声的把黑色的天空，划了一道白痕，慢慢儿左右幌荡着，搜索着，可是找不出什么来。
　　第二章　琳娜
    琳娜在战争爆发前十个月就结婚了。
    在近郊的乡村里，举行了一个游艺会大检阅。在唱歌，跳舞和朗诵人的中间，村里翻筋斗的人，也应该把自己的成绩来表演一下呢。区体育会就派琳娜来参加了检阅。
    公营事业管理处预备了一辆卡车。琳娜坐在不舒服的，满是灰尘的车尾的板凳上。两边的板凳上，坐着一些陌生的，其他机关的同志们。
    这些陌生的人，都穿着皮外套和雨衣，带着皮包。琳娜穿着蓝卫生衣，她把腰间缝窄了一点，好使身段显得好看些。把袖子卷到肘弯上。现在她想把袖子放下来，放到同手指一般齐，可是她不好意思放。她独自坐着，同一切人离得远远的，每当车子颠簸的时候，她都被颠起来。剪短的头发，在她脸上掀动着。
    男子们都大声谈论着，不知在笑着什么。他们都没注意琳娜。
    当时天气闷热得很。薄紫色的乌云，由地平线后边爬上来，上升着，把半个天都遮住了，甚至还没来得及把太阳遮住的时候，倾盆的大雨就下来了。面前的雨注，就象一堵水墙似的。雨水象河流似的，从琳娜的头上和背上流下来，她的蓝卫生衣，裙子，短发，顷刻间全都湿透了。男子们都用外套和雨衣，从头上盖起来，不知在叫些什么。司机若无其事的坐在自己的紧闭着的车头上。琳娜象水母鸡似的在想着：“他们都是多无赖呵！”
    突然，一个男子站起来。没把外套从头上揭下来，弯着腰，走到琳娜跟前坐下。
    “来这样着吧！”他说着，于是用自己的皮外套边，盖到她头上。
    她觉得他们两个人就象钻在一个窄狭的帐幕里似的。她只得缩着身子，才能好好儿躲起来。大雨在外套上打着。
    她浑身又湿又冷的连一点也不觉得拘束了。她只气着救的人来得这么迟，他多会才猜想到呢，傻瓜！
    她的头靠在他胸前。她往下看了一眼，只看见抽紧的，沈重的，好象帆布似的湿裙子下边，靠得紧紧的湿膝盖和一块方格布的外套里子。
    突然，她听见耳边有一阵迟缓的叩击声。这是他的心在跳呢。是他的心呵。
    她惊奇起来，顷听着。真的，起初心没有跳，这就是说，跳当然是跳了，可是那是正常的跳，没有响声。可是现在却大跳特跳起来了。
    为什么心这样跳呢？
    她很想看一看他的脸。因为不晓得他是一个什么样的人。他的心不这样跳，也许是这样儿吧，最好叫心不要跳吗？不，管他象什么样儿，反正让他的心跳去好了。
    心在跳着。
    她想叫亮一点，于是就一点不动的，用两个手指把那帐幕似的外套，从前边拨开了一道小缝，小心的转过头来，从下面对他的脸望了一眼。
    那脸是阴沈的，愁眉不展的，惊慌不安的。一双黑眼睛，向下看着琳娜。
    她急忙又低下头来，再不抬起来了。此刻在这帐幕似的皮外套下边跳的，已经是两颗心了。
    她闭起眼睛，听着这一阵风暴——她心里和他心里的风暴。
    一阵火热的旋风，在她心里腾起来了——羞惭，羞惭的愉快，骄傲，惊奇和狂欢。
    雨停了，他站了起来。
    “好了，”他有点不知所措的微笑着说。“好象我们已经到了，……可是你坐着吧，现在这样坐着吧！”他马上加了一句，把外套披到她肩上。“你会着凉的……”
    可是，当时她一个人这样坐着，觉得很愁闷。于是她取下外套，就拧起裙子边上的水来。太阳又晒起来了。卡车上的积水，有一脚脖深。发着一股湿土气，湿荞麦气，湿艾气——好清爽的空气呵。她的脸也是极好的。而最好不过的是这场雨，只是为什么它这样快的就停了呢，尽下尽下着才好呢。　　　（未完）
