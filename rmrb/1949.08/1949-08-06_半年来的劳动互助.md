	Labor Mutual Aid in the Past Six Months
	Xing Yi
	(I) Overview of Labor Mutual Aid

	I. This year, labor mutual aid in various regions has played a significant role and has seen new developments in the production struggles of preparing for spring plowing, drought-resistant planting, and overcoming disasters. During the preparation for spring plowing in February and March, organization helped overcome labor shortages in production due to support for the front lines, disaster relief, and famine relief, enabling the timely completion of tasks such as delivering manure, plowing, harrowing, building embankments, and repairing agricultural tools. In particular, since April, 158,000 earthen wells have been dug throughout the region, ensuring the timely sowing of two to three million mu of cotton and field crops. The role of organization was even more evident in utilizing all water sources and organizing to carry water for planting and fighting drought. The scale of organization has also become more widespread than in previous years. In old and semi-old areas, the number of groups and people that can be statistically accounted for generally represents about 50% of the total number of households. In some places, it reaches about 80%. For example, in Xingtai, Taihang, statistics from 158 villages show that 81% of the 16,875 households are organized. In the 18 counties of central Hebei, the number of mutual aid groups increased from 35,000 last year to 75,000 this year. At the same time, there are many small, temporary mutual aid arrangements, such as reciprocal labor exchange and animal sharing, that are not "recognized" by cadres but are actually very active. If these were included in the statistics, the number of people and households organized would reach 80% to 90% of the total. Of course, in this year's labor mutual aid, there were periods and regions where the leadership either let things drift without leadership or without daring to lead (generally more serious in the old areas before April) or had serious phenomena of commandism and formalism (more serious in the new and semi-old areas after April). This was particularly evident in the insufficient investigation and research into the mutual aid movement in various regions, and in the forced assignment of labor and compulsory compilation of groups in drought-resistant planting in some areas. However, these issues have generally been corrected or are being corrected.

	II. This year's labor mutual aid is characterized by the widespread development of small, flexible mutual aid groups. For example, in 81 villages in Changzhi, Taihang, there are 825 groups with a total of 3,245 households participating, averaging three to five households per group. In another example, statistics from 1,906 villages in 18 counties of central Hebei show 74,002 groups, 197,000 households, and 412,717 laborers, averaging 2.7 households and 5.5 full or semi-laborers per group. Some of these mutual aid organizations are spontaneous mutual assistance among relatives and neighbors, centered on livestock sharing and technology, combined with joint ownership of agricultural tools and waterwheels, based on the exchange of equivalent labor, voluntary combination, and an indefinite number of people. Some have group leaders, while others are led by whoever they are working for. They help each other when needed and disband when not. They exchange labor, do not provide meals, and arrange their own work. Its advantage is that it is simple and flexible, voluntary for both parties, and has a core of combination, initially suitable for the needs of agricultural cultivation conditions after land reform, with decentralized land, animal power, and agricultural tools, and a shortage of labor. However, little attention is paid to equivalent value, and there is an emphasis on generosity. There is also poor planning in the use of labor and animal power, making it only suitable for urgent tasks and not conducive to long-term increased production and prosperity. Therefore, it needs to be gradually improved on this basis to make it more suitable for the requirements of increased production and prosperity.

	Another type is the division of large groups into small groups based on existing mutual aid, in order to facilitate life arrangements. When necessary, the large group still adjusts labor. This is not only because they have implemented the policy of voluntarism and mutual benefit over the years, but also because they have overcome various difficulties and disasters through mutual aid, and their lives have become relatively prosperous. They have also created a set of consolidated experiences and methods. In particular, the leading cadres have always maintained close ties with the masses, and conscious cadres, heroes, model workers, Communist Party members, and activists serve as the backbone. These small mutual aid activities adapt to the production habits of the masses, facilitate life arrangements, and facilitate planned adjustments of labor.

	There is also "covert" mutual aid, which is a spontaneous mutual aid group that generally does not have a group leader, but is led by activists. It does not calculate or evaluate work, but there is a general sense of equivalent value. In the statistics from the second district of Xingtai, this type accounts for 83% of the 580 groups. This type of mutual aid group is based on the habits of the masses and genuine voluntarism. They have actual mutual aid activities, but they are afraid of too many meetings, afraid of investigation and statistics, afraid of replacing administrative duties and delaying work, afraid of not being casual, and afraid of not being equivalent. Therefore, they do not admit that they have mutual aid. In Xingtai, this mutual aid is called "organized mutual aid without organization." This is mainly due to the influence of commandism and formalism over the years, coupled with insufficient publicity of the mutual aid policy. Therefore, in the future, we must respect this type of mutual aid, learn from its experience, and provide specific and necessary assistance to gradually develop it. It is definitely not a solution to blindly deny it or send people to control the leadership and rigidly apply a set of experiences and methods, as some regions do.

	(II) Experience of Labor Mutual Aid and Current Problems

	I. The view that organizing labor mutual aid is "for increasing production" must be clarified. The actual effect of mutual aid should be checked based on increased production. This is the experience of previous years, and it is also the basic experience of this year. Facts have proved that wherever the masses do this, mutual aid is active and production achievements are great, such as in Shili Village, Huguan, and Licheng in Taihang, Wangjiazhuang in Jin County and Dongli Village in Anping in central Hebei, Lizhai and Nanmajiang in Jincheng in Taiyue, Houjing in Yangcheng, and Luo Village in Tunliu. However, in some areas, there is still mutual aid for the sake of mutual aid, mutual aid for the sake of making a big splash, mutual aid for代耕 (farming for others), preferential treatment for military families, and helping orphans and widows, as well as organizing mutual aid to "revolutionize poverty," "revolutionize each caring for themselves," and "revolutionize backwardness" (of course, this is only for the future, and many measures are still needed. The current focus should be on how to increase production). Under the control of this view, because it is divorced from the current production needs of the masses and divorced from realistic possible conditions, the masses do not need this kind of mutual aid. If it is forced, commandism and formalism will inevitably occur. For example, in the ninth district of Dingxing, out of 378 groups with 1,935 people, only 15 groups with 127 people have mutual aid activities. In another example, some district cadres immediately ordered the masses to organize within a time limit as soon as they arrived in the village. Some only allow the masses freedom to join the group, but do not allow the masses freedom to leave the group. "Mutual aid should be voluntary, and the whole village must do it." Some mobilize and organize comprehensively in one meeting or one night, or threaten not to adjourn the meeting unless they organize. Therefore, some masses in Taihang call it "mutual aid groups that do not see the sun" (no mutual aid during the day). In individual areas of the new district, there is a phenomenon of compulsory compilation of large-scale labor assignment, large-scale mutual aid, and collective work. For example, in Peijiabao in Changli, Fengzhuang in Leting, central Hebei, Wuqing County, and Shouyang County in Taiyuan, this phenomenon has occurred in individual villages. Therefore, continuing to implement the spirit of the agricultural and forestry conference on labor mutual aid, summing up the experiences and lessons of mutual aid, and overcoming the bias of commandism and formalism are the decisive links in further improving labor mutual aid.

	II. The leadership should rely on the active leadership of rural branches, Party member cadres, heroes, and model workers, promote the demands of the masses and raise them according to the needs of the masses, combined with the universal publicity and calls of the administration (or the People's Congress), and seize the main key points in the production movement, such as spring plowing, sowing, weeding, and accumulating fertilizer. Timely propose tasks, organize forces, and conduct re-elections. This way, leadership of mutual aid is realized through the production movement, with realistic and lively slogans of encouragement, and with rich and practical mutual aid content. This form of mutual aid based on certain live activities has many possibilities to develop from temporary partnerships to planned production mutual aid, and to establish certain systems because they feel the actual need in the production process. For example, Yang Guangzhan and four other households in Heshun, Taihang, first temporarily sowed together, felt the role of mutual aid, consciously elected a group leader, established leadership, and established a preliminary equivalent value system. This is consolidation and this is improvement, and only such leadership can be warmly welcomed by the masses. On the contrary, standing outside the production of the masses, simply using administrative orders, empty calls, and blindly transforming and improving cannot solve the current realistic problems in production. As a result, it not only wastes the precious time of the masses, but also increases many confused views among the masses, causing the opposition of the masses, or passive resistance, thus generating a laissez-faire attitude among some cadres. Therefore, to overcome this phenomenon and oppose laissez-faire, it must start here.

	III. Cooperation and mutual assistance are the direction of rural economic development and the path from poverty to prosperity. In addition to carrying out general and necessary organizational education work, the state must provide economic and technical assistance, such as giving priority to agricultural loans, especially by adopting the method of granting loans in kind with a focus to assist production, which is even more necessary. For example, new-style agricultural tools such as liberation weeding hoes, waterwheels, sprayers, pesticides, fertilizers, and improved varieties, etc., can only be afforded (or bought), used, and play a greater role, and ensure that special funds are used for special purposes and that loans are borrowed and repaid, only by organizing. At the same time, in terms of science and technology, the promotion networks and promotion stations in various places should use better mutual aid groups as grass-roots organizations, and carry out technical guidance work according to different agricultural seasons and agricultural activities, and the urgent needs of the masses, such as promoting improved varieties, seed soaking, seed selection, pest control, using new agricultural tools, chemical fertilizers, scientific management methods for crops, management of fruit trees, and agricultural product manufacturing. Only through mutual aid groups can it be combined with the production experience of farmers, and can the improvement of science and technology form a broad mass movement. Facts have proved that only by organizing can there be convenient conditions for intensive cultivation and improving technology. Only by organizing can it be easier to overcome the backward, conservative, and narrow experience of farmers, and it is easier to accept the guidance of science and technology. Although there have been many achievements in this regard this year, it is still far from enough in the whole region.

	IV. According to the specific production conditions and production needs of various places, planned development of mass professional organizations should be carried out, such as well-drilling teams, well-drilling classes, canal repair, afforestation, and wasteland reclamation. This kind of larger-scale mutual aid organization based on labor, combined with technology, funds, and tools, is of great significance to the country's long-term construction in the future. In addition, in order to solve the problem of labor shortage, according to the different climates and crop planting in various places, and the different busy and slack seasons of farm work, places where there used to be jobbing teams and short-term labor markets can still be restored. This method of adjusting labor on a larger scale through market relations is beneficial to the overall development of production.

    半年来的劳动互助
    邢毅
    （一）劳动互助的概况
    一、今年各地劳动互助，在准备春耕、抗旱点种、战胜灾害等生产斗争中，发挥了很大的作用，并有了新的发展。在二、三月春耕准备时，由于组织起来，克服了在生产中因支前、救灾渡荒的劳力困难，及时完成送粪、犁地、耙地、垒堰、修置农具等任务，特别是四月以来在全区打土井十五万八千眼，保证二、三百万亩棉花及大田作物及时下种，并在利用一切水源，组织起来担水点种，抗旱斗争中，更显出组织起来的作用。在组织起来的规模上也较往年更为普遍，从老区半老区来说，能够统计的组数、人数，一般在总户数的百分之五十左右。有的地方达百分之八十左右，如太行邢台，一百五十八村统计，一万六千八百七十五户中，有百分之八十一的户数组织起来；冀中十八县统计，去年有三万五千个互助组，今年则新增七万五千组。同时还有许多不为干部所“承认”而实际存在的临时结合的小型互助拨工换工、＠①犋等很多，也很活跃，如果统计起来，组织起来的人数户数，将会达总人数户数百分之八、九十。当然在今年劳动互助中在某一时期某一地区在领导上曾发生过互助不用领导或不敢领导的放任自流（一般在四月以前老区比较严重）和严重的强迫命令形式主义的（在四月以后新区半老区比较严重）现象，特别表现到各地对互助运动的调查研究不够，及某些地区在抗旱点种中大拨工强迫编制等方面，但一般都得到纠正或正在纠正中。
    二、今年劳动互助的特点，是小型灵活的互助组普遍发展。如太行长治八十一村统计八百二十五组共参加三千二百四十五户，每组平均在三至五户。又如冀中十八县一千九百零六村统计有七万四千零二组，十九万七千户，四十一万二千七百一十七劳力，每组平均二·七户，整半劳力五·五个。这种互助组织，有的是群众自发的亲友近邻互助，以牲口＠犋和技术为核心，结合农具水车的合伙，以相等劳力的变工，自愿结合，人数不定，有的有组长，有的给谁干活谁领导，需要就互助，不需要就解散，工换工，不管饭，自己活自己安排，他的好处是简便灵活，双方自愿，有结合核心，初步适合土地改革后，土地畜力农具的分散，劳力不足的农业耕作条件的需要。但是多不注意等价，讲涵厚，在劳力畜力的使用上计划性较差，只适合于突击任务，不宜于长期增产发家的要求，因此需要在此基础上，逐步提高，使之更适于增产发家要求。
    另一种是在旧有的互助基础上，为了生活便于安排，由大组划为小组，遇有必要时仍以大组调剂劳力，这不仅由于他们历年来贯彻了自愿两利的政策，而且已经从互助中战胜了灾荒各种困难，生活比较富裕起来，也确实创造一套巩固的经验与办法，特别是领导骨干一直和群众紧密的联系，有为群众服务的、有觉悟的干部英雄模范、共产党员、积极分子作骨干，这些小型互助的活动形式，适应群众生产习惯，便于生活安排，便于有计划调剂劳力。
    还有一种是“暗”互助，这是一种自发的互助组，一般没有组长，但有积极分子的领导，不计工评工，但有大体上的等价。在邢台二区统计五百八十组中即占百分之八十三，此种互助组是建立在群众习惯与真正自愿的基础上的，有互助实际活动，但他们害怕开会多，怕调查、统计，怕代替行政职务误工，怕不随便，怕不等价，因此不承认有互助，邢台对这种互助，叫作“互助起来无组织”。这主要是由于历年来强迫命令与形式主义作风的影响，加上对互助政策的宣传不够所致，故今后对这类互助，必须尊重，向其学习经验进行具体必要的帮助，使之逐渐发展，而决非某些地区盲目的不承认，或者派人去控制领导权死搬一套经验办法可以解决问题的。
    （二）劳动互助的经验及当前存在的问题
    一、组织劳动互助就是“为了增产”的观点必须明确，检查互助的实际效果，应以增产为依据，这是历年的经验，同样也是今年的基本经验。事实证明，凡是这样作的群众互助就活跃，生产的成绩就大，如太行壶关十里村、黎城，冀中晋县王家庄、安平东里村，太岳晋城李寨、南马匠，阳城侯井，屯留罗村等地，但是在部分地区，仍有为互助而互助，为轰轰烈烈而互助，为代耕、优军、提携孤寡而互助，还有为“革穷命”、“革各顾各的命”、“革落后的命”而组织互助（当然这只是将来的事情，还必须有许多措施，目前应是如何增产才对）。在这样观点支配之下，由于他脱离了群众当前增产要求，脱离现实可能条件，群众是不需要这样互助的，如硬要组织，就必然发生强迫命令、形式主义，如定兴九区三百七十八组一千九百三十五人，有互助活动的仅十五组一百二十七人。又如也有的区干一到村即令群众限期组织起来，也有的只要群众入组自由，不让群众出组自由，“互助要自愿，全村都得干”。也有在一个会上或一个晚上，就全面动员组织起来，或者以不组织起来不散会来威胁。故太行有的群众称为“不见太阳的互助组”（白天不互助）。在新区个别地区，有强迫编制大拨工、大互助、集体干活的现象。如冀东昌黎裴家堡、乐亭丰庄，冀中武清县，太原寿阳县等个别村庄，都曾有此种现象，所以继续贯彻农林会议上关于劳动互助的精神，好好总结互助经验教训，克服强迫命令、形式主义的偏向，是使劳动互助进一步的提高的决定环节。
    二、领导上要依靠农村支部、党员干部、英雄模范的积极带头，把群众要求，根据群众需要的提高推动，结合行政上（或人民代表会）的普遍宣传号召，抓紧生产运动中的几个主要关键，如春耕播种、锄苗、积肥等。及时提出任务，组织力量，进行改选，这样透过生产运动来实现对互助的领导，有现实的生动活泼的鼓动口号，有实际的丰富的互助内容，这种根据一定活计进行互助的形式，有很多可以经过临时伙合，发展到有计划的生产互助，在生产过程中感到实际需要而建立一定制度。如太行和顺杨光占等四户，就是先临时一块下种，感到互助的作用，自觉选举组长，建立了领导，建立了初步的等价制度，这就是巩固就是提高，也只有这样的领导，才能受到群众的热烈的欢迎。反之站在群众生产之外，单纯用行政命令，空洞号召，盲目改造提高等，不能解决生产中当前现实问题，结果不仅浪费了群众宝贵的时间，而且增加了群众许多糊涂观点，引起群众的反对，或消极抵抗，因而在部分干部中，产生了放任自流的思想，所以克服这样现象，反对放任自流，必须从这里着手。
    三、合作互助是农村经济发展的方向，是从贫困走向富裕的道路，除了进行一般必要组织教育工作外，在国家必须给以经济上、技术上的援助，如农贷的优先贷给，特别以农贷采用有重点的贷放实物以援助生产的办法，更为必要。如新式农具之解放耘锄、水车、喷雾器及农药、肥料以及优良品种等，只有组织起来，才能贷（或买）得起，用得开，发挥更大作用，才能保证专款专用，有借有还。同时在科学技术上，各地推广网，推广站，应该以较好的互助组，作为基层组织，根据不同的农事季节农事活动，和群众迫切需要推行技术指导工作，如推广优良品种、侵种、选种、防治虫害、使用新式农具、化学肥料、农作物的科学管理方法、果树的管理、农产制造等，只有通过互助组，才能和农民的生产经验相结合，才能把科学技术的改进形成广泛的群众性的运动。事实证明，只有组织起来，才有精耕细作，提高技术的便利条件，只有组织起来，才容易克服农民落后保守的狭隘的经验，更容易接受科学技术的指导，今年在这方面，虽已有了不少的成绩，但就全区范围来说，还是很不够的。
    四、根据各地具体的生产条件，生产需要，应使有计划的发展，群众性的专业组织，如打井队，打井班，修渠，造林，开垦荒地等，这种以劳力为基础，结合技术资金工具等的较大范围的互助组织，对今后国家的长期建设是有很大作用的。另外为解决劳力困难问题可根据各地气候作物种植不同，农活忙闲不同等条件，过去有扎工队，短工市的地方，仍可以恢复，这种通过市场关系，使劳力在较大范围内得到调剂的办法，对整个发展生产是有好处的。
