　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, August 20th: TASS, Pyongyang, August 18th: According to sources in Seoul, the Minister of Justice of the South Korean puppet government has ordered the police to arrest six members of the South Korean so-called "National Assembly" because they sympathize with the Korean People's Democratic Republic. Previously, ten other members of the "National Assembly" were arrested for the same reason. This shows that the Lee Seung-man puppet government is increasingly isolated and unstable.
