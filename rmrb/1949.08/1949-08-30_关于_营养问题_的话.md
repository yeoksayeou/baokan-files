A Word on "Nutrition Problems"
    Kang Xin
    For years, under the anti-people wars of Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the exploitation and oppression of feudal bureaucratic imperialism, and the impact of floods and droughts, the majority of people in the newly liberated areas have not restored production, their living standards are low, and their health levels have declined, except for the old liberated areas that have implemented land reform and developed production to improve people's lives. Now that the nationwide liberation is imminent, we must "produce and economize to build our homes" (as the Commander-in-Chief said). For the victory of industrial and agricultural production, there must be healthy laborers, so we must study nutrition work to protect the labor force; for the sake of economy, we must also study current nutritional problems in order to improve nutrition and enhance physical strength on the one hand, and study affordable and nutritious foods allowed by the current situation, promote large-scale production, and select supplies on the other hand, so that it can meet the current requirements of production and economy. We advocate this view: During the period of economy, we should further study and improve nutrition methods in order to oppose the idea that economy cannot improve nutrition.
    The purpose of this issue is to serve this goal.

　　关于“营养问题”的话
    康心
    连年在日本帝国主义及国民党反动派反人民的战争、封建官僚帝国主义的剥削压迫，以及水旱天灾的影响下，除老解放区实行土地改革和发展生产，改善人民生活外，新解放区大多数人民生产未恢复，生活程度低，健康水准下降。现在全国解放在即，我们要“生产节约，建立家务”（总司令语）。为着工业农业生产胜利，必须有健康的劳动者，那就必须研究营养工作，以保护劳动力；为着节约，更必须研究当前营养问题，以求得一面改进营养，增强体力，一面研究现状所允许的，价廉而营养丰富的食品，宣传推行多量生产，选择供应，这样才能适合于目前生产节约的要求。我们提倡这样的观点：在节约期间，更应该研究与改进营养的方法，以反对那种节约就不能改进营养的思想。
    本期的编刊意义，就想为这个目的服务。
