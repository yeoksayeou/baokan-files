    Providing a National Example of Implementing People's Democracy
    Shijiazhuang People's Congress Concludes
    Elects 25 Representatives from All Sectors as Government Committee Members; Liu Xiufeng and Zang Boping Elected as Mayor and Deputy Mayor
    [Shijiazhuang Telegraph] The Shijiazhuang People's Congress, which opened on the 21st of last month, successfully concluded on the 9th of this month. After twenty days of heated discussion, the Congress diligently reviewed and approved Deputy Mayor Zang Boping's report on municipal work over the past year and a half. It also discussed and adopted Mayor Liu Xiufeng's future policy guidelines, transforming Chairman Mao's all-encompassing policies and the principle of unity into the guiding principles for the construction of Shijiazhuang's 200,000 people. The representatives further carefully discussed over 500 proposals and made 13 important resolutions. These are concrete implementation plans for the policy guidelines. Finally, through democratic means, twenty-five members of the Municipal Government Committee were elected, and Liu Xiufeng and Zang Boping were elected as Mayor and Deputy Mayor, respectively. As the unanimous voices inside and outside the conference declared, this was a successful congress for the cause of democracy.
    The achievements of the Congress are reflected in two aspects: Firstly, it boldly implemented democracy, united people from all strata, further strengthened the local people's democratic dictatorship, and further strengthened the close relationship between the government and the people. Firstly, the new Government Committee includes representatives from all sectors of society. Such as Ji Gengsheng, Chen Meisheng, and Song Gongyu and other veteran workers from the "February 7th" strike. Old Ji is a veteran production hero of the railway machinery factory and a model for the entire factory. Chen Meisheng and Song Gongyu are both district chiefs loved and supported by the people. There is also Yan Jinfen, a model female worker from Da Xing Yarn Factory, who is a force for uniting all female workers in promoting production. There are also turned-over peasant leaders Lu Chunfa and Zhao Ganping, as well as Hui representative Elder Ping Lian. These native-born Government Committee members all have close ties to the broad masses of working people. There are also Zhao Ming and five other industrialists and businessmen. Therefore, the participation of these committee members representing the interests of all strata in the government is a major symbol of democratization. Secondly, in the two reports of the Mayor and Deputy Mayor, the representatives and citizens further recognized the democratic government's selfless spirit of serving the people and its sincere determination to build Shijiazhuang. For example, Deputy Mayor Zang's detailed report on the financial revenue and expenditure in the government work report surprised all the representatives and citizens, who believed that the government reporting accounts to the people was unprecedented in history. Therefore, the representatives dared to speak out in discussions and put forward their opinions on promoting advantages and eliminating disadvantages. The second achievement of the Congress was the implementation of all-encompassing policy thinking, laying a solid foundation for the future development of industry and commerce in Shijiazhuang. Based on the objective conditions of Shijiazhuang, the direction of industrial development was determined, overcoming blind production, and striving to develop production plans for key industries—iron and cotton textiles. Under the principle of benefiting both public and private sectors, state-owned trade and cooperative departments can adopt ordering methods to supply private industries with necessary raw materials and recover finished products. The representatives criticized some industrialists and businessmen for their dishonest and selfish behavior, pointing out that a certain factory gave a bad pot to the trading company, turning it into waste and causing losses to the public. They also criticized the fact that some waterwheels did not meet standards and only cared about making money, violating the principle of taking into account both public and private interests. The understanding of the ideology of benefiting both labor and capital was also further clarified, which is of decisive significance for stabilizing labor-management relations and uniting to develop production. After heated discussions, the Congress, after making some supplements, passed the "Shijiazhuang Private Factory and Store Employee Wage, Working Hours, Welfare, Labor Protection Wartime Provisional Measures," "Shijiazhuang Iron Industry Employee Wage, Working Hours, Welfare, etc. Wartime Provisional Measures," and "Shijiazhuang Cotton Textile Industry Employee Wage, Working Hours, Welfare, etc. Wartime Provisional Measures" proposed by the Shijiazhuang General Labor Union. On the issue of urban-rural mutual assistance, the representatives of the Congress unanimously believed that the Farmers' Service Center had achieved great success and needed to be expanded. It was decided that state-owned, public-owned, and private factories should closely contact the service centers, supply farmers with the industrial products they need, and help them sell agricultural and rural by-products. The Shijiazhuang Iron Factory will focus on transforming agricultural tools as its main production target. Agricultural production should promote special crops to supply the city with textile raw materials. At the jubilant closing ceremony, the new government committee members and representatives enthusiastically expressed their determination to serve the people. Mayor Liu Xiufeng emphasized in his closing speech: "To build Shijiazhuang well, we must rely on the people. Without the efforts of the people, no government committee member can do it." Finally, all the representatives unanimously shouted: Closely connect with the masses, bring the resolutions of the Congress to the masses, and concentrate the opinions of the masses into the government.

    提供了全国实行人民民主的范例
    石市人民代表大会闭幕
    选出各界代表廿五人为政府委员刘秀峰、臧伯平荣任正副市长
    【石家庄电】石家庄市人民代表大会，于上月二十一日揭幕，至本月九日圆满结束。经过二十天的热烈讨论，认真地审查与批准了臧伯平副市长的一年半以来的市政工作报告，并讨论与通过了刘秀峰市长的今后施政方针，把毛主席四面八方的政策与团结的方针变成了石家庄二十万人民的建设方针。代表们更仔细地讨论了五百多件提案，作出十三项重要决议。这是施政方针的具体实行方案。最后以民主方式选出了二十五名市政府委员，并推出刘秀峰、臧伯平任正副市长。正象会内和会后的一致呼声一样，这是一个民主的事业成功的大会。
    大会的成就表现在两方面：第一是放手实行民主，团结了各阶层人民，进一步建设了地方性的人民民主专政的政权，进一步密切了政府与人民的关系。首先是在新的政府委员中，包括了各个阶层的代表人物。如计根生、陈梅生、宋公玉等“二七”老工人。计老是铁路机厂的生产老英雄，是全厂的模范，陈梅生、宋公玉都是人民爱戴和拥护的区长；有大兴纱厂模范女工阎金芬，她是团结全厂女工推动生产的力量；有翻身农民领袖陆春阀和赵甘平，还有回民代表平连老人。这些土生土长的政府委员，都是和广大劳动群众有着密切的血肉关系。还有赵铭等五位工商业家。因此，这些代表各阶层利益的委员参加政府，正是民主化的主要标志。其次在正副市长的两个报告中，代表和市民们，进一步认识了民主政府大公无私的为人民服务的精神，和诚心诚意建设石家庄的决心。如臧副市长政府工作报告中财政收支的详细报告，引起了全体代表和市民们的惊奇，认为政府向人民报帐是历史上没有过的事情。因此，代表们在讨论中敢于发言，提出自己与利除弊的意见。大会的第二个成就贯彻了四面八方的政策思想，给石家庄今后发展工商业打下巩固的基础。根据石家庄的客观条件，确定发展工业的方向，克服盲目生产，尽量作出重点行业——铁业和棉织业——的生产计划。在公私两利原则下，公营贸易合作部门可以采取订货办法供给私人行业必要的原料，收回成品。代表们批评了有些工商业家不老实的自私行为，指出某厂把坏锅给了贸易公司，成了废物，使公家吃了亏。又批评了有些水车不合标准化，只顾赚钱的违反公私兼顾的事实。对劳资两利政策的思想，也更加明确，这对安定劳资情绪，团结一致发展生产是有决定意义的。经过热烈的讨论，大会稍作补充之后，通过了石市总工会提出的“石市私营工厂商店职工工资工时福利劳动保护战时暂行办法”、“石市铁工业职工工资工时福利等战时暂行办法”与“石市棉织业职工工资工时福利等战时暂行办法”。在城乡互助问题上，大会代表一致认为农民服务所成绩很大，有扩大的必要。并决定国营公营私营工厂应密切与服务所联系，供给农民需要的工业品，代为推销农产品与农村副产品。石市铁工厂将以改造农具为主要生产对象。农业生产应提倡特种作物，以供给城市作纺织原料。在欢欣鼓舞的闭幕典礼上，新政府委员们和代表们热烈表示为人民服务的决心。刘秀峰市长在闭幕词中着重指出：“我们要把石家庄建设好，必须依靠老百姓，没有老百姓的努力，任何政府委员也办不到的。”最后全体代表一致高呼：密切联系群众，把大会的决议带到群众中去，把群众意见集中到政府中来。
