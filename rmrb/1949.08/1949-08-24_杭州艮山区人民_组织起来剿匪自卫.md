　　Hangzhou, Gengshan District, People
  　Organize to Suppress Bandits and Defend Themselves
　　[Hangzhou News] The people of Gengshan District in Hangzhou broke through their worries and initially organized to defend themselves against bandits and special agents. Half a month ago, robbery cases occurred every night in the district, sometimes several in one night. Furthermore, bandits and special agents often spread rumors to intimidate the masses and distort and misinterpret the People's Government's lenient policies, saying things like, "The People's Liberation Army likes bandits and robbers."
    Many people were so disturbed by the bandits that they ran to bamboo forests to sleep at night, even complaining that the People's Liberation Army was "too lenient towards bandits." Based on the above situation, the district committee studied how to publicize policies, expose rumors, and support the people's just demands. Therefore, it was decided to start by providing armed support for the suppression of remnant bandits. At this time, the cadres and local armed forces, fearing no fatigue, conducted searches and arrests as soon as they discovered clues about bandits and special agents, and constantly carried out armed patrols day and night, using practical actions to shatter the bandits' rumors. The people immediately demanded that the People's Liberation Army be stationed in their area and began reporting to the People's Liberation Army the areas where bandits and special agents were hiding. After arresting them, the People's Government actively called on the people to organize to suppress bandits and defend themselves, and convened a meeting of former Bao-Jia chiefs, calling on them to perform meritorious service in the work of suppressing bandits in order to atone for their crimes. In the past half month, eleven Bao with more than 5,400 people in the district have been organized, capturing a total of eleven bandits and special agents, who have all been sent to the district and then to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.

　　杭州艮山区人民
  　组织起来剿匪自卫
    【杭州讯】杭市艮山区人民打破顾虑，初步组织起来，自卫反对匪特。半月前，该区每夜都有抢案发生，甚至一夜数起。且匪特常常散布谣言恐吓群众，污蔑曲解人民政府的宽大政策，如说：“解放军喜欢土匪强盗。”
    不少群众被匪闹得晚上跑到竹林里去睡觉，甚至埋怨解放军“对土匪太宽大”。根据以上情况，区委研究了如何宣传政策、揭发谣言、支持人民的正义要求。于是决定首先从武装支持清剿残匪着手。这时干部及当地武装，不怕一切疲劳，发现匪特线索即进行剿捕，白天黑夜不断武装巡逻，用实际行动粉碎了匪特的谣言。人民当即要求解放军驻防到他们那里去，并开始向解放军报告匪特藏匿的地区，予以逮捕，之后，人民政府积极号召人民组织起来剿匪自卫，并召开旧保甲长会议，号召他们在剿匪工作中立功赎罪。半个月来，全区已有十一个保五千四百余人组织起来，共捕获了匪特十一名，都已先后送区转送公安局讯办。
