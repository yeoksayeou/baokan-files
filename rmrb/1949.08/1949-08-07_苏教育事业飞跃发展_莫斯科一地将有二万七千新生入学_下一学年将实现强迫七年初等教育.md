Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: Moscow dispatch: Higher, secondary, and primary education in the Soviet Union is developing rapidly. As the new academic year is about to begin, Soviet higher education institutions began entrance examinations on the 1st. This year, 1.9 million new students will enter higher education institutions. In Moscow alone, the number will exceed 27,000. The entrance examinations are very strict, but outstanding secondary school graduates and veterans who have won gold or silver medals can be admitted preferentially without examination.

Young people are particularly eager to enter the departments of mechanical engineering, biology, mathematics, and languages ​​at Moscow State Lomonosov University. The school has a quota of 2,000 new students, and 4,500 people have applied, but 850 outstanding secondary school graduates who have won gold and silver medals have been given priority admission, and another group of veterans have also been given priority admission. Many young people are also applying to the Bauman Higher Technical School, the Stalin Machine Tool College, and the Molotov Power College.

More than 220,000 primary schools, seven-year schools, and secondary schools across the Soviet Union are also preparing for the autumn semester. This autumn, these schools will have 34 million students. In the next academic year, universal seven-year compulsory education will be implemented. Students who have completed four years of courses, whether in urban or rural areas, must be promoted to the fifth grade to continue their studies. The All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Soviet government are making every effort to create all necessary prerequisites to raise education to a higher level and further expand the number of young people receiving secondary education. This year, the state has allocated 61 billion rubles for primary and secondary education.
