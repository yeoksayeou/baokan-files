　　North Jiangsu People's Government Enthusiastically Helps
  　Shanghai Industrial Circles to Build Factories, Realization Possible in a Short Period
    [Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station Broadcast] Shanghai News: In order to develop production and shipping in North Jiangsu, industrial and shipping figures and investigation teams from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places have successively arrived in North Jiangsu. Chen Xixiang of Shanghai's industrial circles, as early as in North Jiangsu, inspected the production of cotton fields and seeds, and later planned to establish an oil factory. The factory site is planned to be located in the cotton reclamation area, and new-style machines will be fully adopted, mainly for pressing cottonseed oil, and also operating other vegetable oils. The factory establishment plan has now been filed with the Industry and Commerce Department of the North Jiangsu Administrative Office, and it is expected to be realized in a short period. Before returning to Shanghai, Chen stated that after meeting with the heads of the Industry and Commerce Department of the North Jiangsu Administrative Office and the Taizhou Prefectural Office in North Jiangsu, he was deeply moved by the People's Government's enthusiasm for uniting industrialists and businessmen, and rewarding and supporting industrial and agricultural production. At present, the North Jiangsu People's Government is vigorously supporting the reclamation area to resume production, build water conservancy projects, and promote cotton planting, and hopes that industrial circles in Beijing and Shanghai will invest in development. Therefore, in addition to a warm welcome for Chen Xixiang's visit to North Jiangsu, they are willing to assist in solving difficulties. Regarding the urgent need for urban assistance in developing rural areas, according to the investigation results of technicians from Nanjing Agricultural Machinery Company, the most needed items in agricultural factories and general rural areas in Lianshui, Guanyun, Huaiyin, and other counties are peanut screening machines, harvesters, plows, and seeders (row planting). Taking care of the economic strength of the rural masses, the machine structure must follow the mass line, and small machines must be manufactured first and promoted as a priority.

　　苏北人民政府热忱帮助
  　沪产业界前往建厂短时期即内可实现
    【上海人民广播电台广播】上海消息：为发展苏北生产与航运，京沪等地产业、航运界人士及调查组，已先后抵达苏北。上海产业界陈锡祥，早在苏北考察棉田及种籽等出产情况，以后计划创办油厂，厂址拟设棉垦区，将完全采用新式机器，以压榨棉籽油为主，兼营其他植物油。现设厂计划已呈苏北行署工商处备案，预计短期内可实现。陈氏返沪前表示，此次来苏北会见苏北行署工商处及泰州专署负责人后，体验到人民政府团结工商业家，奖励与扶植工农业生产的热诚，甚为感动。现苏北人民政府正大力扶助垦区恢复生产，兴修水利，推广植棉，并望京沪产业界人士投资开发。故对此次陈锡祥来苏北之举，除热烈欢迎外，并愿协助解决困难。在开发农村，亟需城市协助方面，据南京农械公司技士调查结果，在涟水、灌云、淮阴等县，农厂及一般农村最需要的是筛花生机、收割机、翻土机和播种机（条播）等，照顾农村群众的经济力量，在机器构造上，必须要走群众路线，一定先制小型机器，重点推广。
