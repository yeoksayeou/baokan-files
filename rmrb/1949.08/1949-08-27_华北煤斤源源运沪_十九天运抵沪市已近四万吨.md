　　North China Coal Continuously Shipped to Shanghai
  　Nearly 40,000 Tons Arrive in Shanghai in Nineteen Days
    [Report from our Tianjin office] In order to smash the enemy blockade and ensure a large supply of North China coal to meet Shanghai's industrial needs, the North China Pingjin Coal and Iron Company recently consulted with the Pingjin Railway Bureau regarding the supply of railway cars, and a solution has now been reached. From August 2nd to 25th, except for five days in the middle when excessive rainfall prevented the supply of railway cars, two trains carrying coal have been dispatched south daily, each carrying 2,280 tons. As of August 25th, the amount of coal transported south has reached over 38,000 tons. The company is currently discussing with the Ministry of Railways to secure a greater supply of railway cars in the future, ensuring a continuous flow of North China coal resources to the south.

　　华北煤斤源源运沪
  　十九天运抵沪市已近四万吨
    【本报天津讯】华北平津煤铁公司为了粉碎敌人封锁，使华北煤斤大量供给上海工业需要，日前曾与平津铁路局洽商供给车皮事宜，现已获解决。从八月二日至二十五日，除中间五天因雨水过大不能供应车皮外，每天有两列车载煤南运，每次计二千二百八十吨。截至二十五日止，南运之煤，已达三万八千多吨。该公司现正与铁道部商议，拟今后更多的供应车皮，使华北煤产能源源南运。
