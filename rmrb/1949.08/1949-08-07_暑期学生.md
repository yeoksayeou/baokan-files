    ▲ The first detachment of the Summer Study Group for College and Middle School Students summarized the achievements of the sanitation campaign and launched a long-term labor service within the group. Students from all classes enthusiastically signed up, and more than 300 people have registered so far. On the morning of the 4th, after the rain, there was water under the lecture shed. Just as the report was about to begin, all the students in the sixth class immediately mobilized to drain the water and fill the soil. Students from other classes in the first detachment and detachments two, three, and four also actively participated, and quickly cleared the accumulated water under the lecture shed, earning praise from the detachment committee.

    ▲ After the establishment of the wall newspaper committee of the third detachment of the Summer Study Group, news flashes praising students' exemplary actions and wall posters exchanging experiences are now visible everywhere. However, most adopt the form of large-character posters, which cannot reflect the students' thoughts, learning methods, and experiences more fully. The responsible comrade of the third detachment called on each class to publish a wall newspaper to reflect the typical process of ideological transformation during the first stage of study, as well as the learning situation of the class. Each class is preparing to publish it immediately.

    ▲ The results of the design competition for commemorative badges solicited by the Summer Youth Academy Working Committee were published in "Beiping Youth" the other day. A total of 109 people participated in the design, and the top three winners and ten honorable mentions were selected. The winners were given prizes, and all participants were given a commemorative badge as a souvenir. The first place winner was Ding Guoyu from Men's Fourth Middle School in the central district. His design features a white book with the six characters "Summer Youth Academy" on it, flanked by six red flags on either side. There is a red star on the book, and a row of green leaves on either side, signifying that the students of the Youth Academy are studying hard under the joyful and lively flags. The design has been produced, costing 35 yuan each, and will be completed soon.

    ▲暑期学习团第三分团壁报委员会成立后，表扬同学模范行动的快报和交流经验的墙报，已到处可见。但是多采取大字报形式，不能更多的反映同学思想情况，以及学习的方法及经验。第三分团负责同志号召各班出一壁报，以反映第一阶段学习中典型的思想转变过程，以及本班的学习情况。现在各班准备即日出刊。
