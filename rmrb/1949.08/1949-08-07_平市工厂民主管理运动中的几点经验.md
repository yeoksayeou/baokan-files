    Several Experiences in the Factory Democratic Management Movement in Ping City
    Guo Yong

    At the beginning of the factory management democratization movement in Beiping City, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions did not have a sufficient understanding of the basic spirit of this work. Therefore, in its deployment, there were no clear steps or appropriate methods, but only a deadline was set for completion. As a result, two deviations occurred: one was to rush to meet the deadline and hastily established management committees, but workers still didn't know why; the other was that leading comrades simply didn't pay attention to this movement and delayed its launch. Later, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions clarified that it was necessary to go through publicity and deliberation, launch criticism and self-criticism, and in the movement, workers should feel a sense of ownership before democratic management could be implemented. Some factories, in the course of implementation, made deviations: only publicizing the articles without combining them with reality or criticism could not effectively inspire workers' sense of ownership; therefore, workers' enthusiasm was not high, and they felt that the establishment was also a formality and were still not concerned about factory management. Recently, the reasons why the movement could not progress were: some cadres' thinking was not clear, and they were unwilling to make self-criticisms in front of the masses, fearing loss of prestige; some emphasized that the conditions were not mature, or that the composition of the workers was not strong; some believed that it was best not to carry out democratic movements until workers were given welfare. Still others were administrative leaders who feared that it would hinder their central work and affect production. In many factories, the trade union was acting alone, and the administration was not actively involved. These ideological deviations, after repeated instructions from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, have been corrected in some cases, are being corrected in others, and are continuing in still others. By mid-June, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions focused on creating exemplary cases and also initially explored some experiences.

    Although some detours were taken in this work, certain achievements were also made, and the understanding of cadres and workers has been improved a step further; and some lessons have been learned: (1) Facts have proved that new liberated areas can launch democratic movements after two or three months of work. There is no need to doubt this any longer. The initial idea that the conditions in the newly liberated areas were not mature only showed that our understanding of relying on the working class to manage factories was still vague; at the same time, we did not know that the democratic movement was a process of creating "mature conditions" with practical actions; (2) Criticism and self-criticism must be carried out from top to bottom; if the higher authorities do not make self-criticisms and only ask others to make self-criticisms, the movement will naturally not be able to unfold at all; but it is not enough for only a few main responsible persons to make self-criticisms, the main responsible comrades must first make profound self-criticisms, and ordinary cadre comrades must also make self-criticisms in the same way, and even the old staff members we are preparing to retain must make self-criticisms to the masses and correct their past old style. Only in this way can prestige be improved, the movement can be launched, workers can actively offer opinions, and work will not be difficult to promote; (3) A certain organizational form must be adopted - it is best to convene a meeting of employee representatives. Without this organization, it will form a phenomenon of disorganization and lack of leadership, and opinions will not be easily concentrated and implemented. Asking for opinions piecemeal will make the masses think that their opinions are not respected; (4) The Party, government, trade union, and Youth League must cooperate with each other and act in unison. It must be made clear that the common task of the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League in the factory is to restore and develop production. At the same time, democratic management and the completion of production tasks are inseparable, so it will never affect production; at the same time, it is the first step in developing production; (5) Criticism and self-criticism must be combined with solving practical problems: workers look at problems from a practical point of view, and we should do what we say and never procrastinate. If the movement has been launched, and workers have made hundreds of suggestions, and the leaders also believe that it "helps the work a lot," and therefore think that everything is fine, but if it is not implemented, then the movement will be in vain.

    平市工厂民主管理运动中的几点经验
    国涌
    北平市工厂管理民主化运动，一开始市总工会对这一工作的基本精神，认识不足，所以在布置时，就没有明确的步骤和适当的方式，只是限期完成，结果出了两种偏向：一种是为了赶限期，匆匆成立了管委会，成立后工人还不知道为什么；一种是领导同志根本没有重视这一运动，迟迟展不开。后来市总工会明确了要经过宣传酝酿，展开批评与自我批评，在运动中要使工人有了主人翁感觉，才能实行管理民主化。有的厂子在实施当中，又出了偏差：光是宣传条文，不结合实际，不结合批评，这也不能很好启发工人主人翁思想；因此工人劲头不大，觉得成立也是形式，对工厂管理还是不关心。近来这一时期，运动不能进展的原因，有的是干部思想没打通，不愿到群众面前作检讨，怕丧失威信；有的强调条件不成熟，或是职工成份不强；认为没给工人准备好福利，最好不开展民主运动；又有的是行政负责同志怕妨碍他的中心工作，影响生产。不少的工厂是工会唱独脚戏，行政不积极来搞。这些思想上的偏差，经市总工会一再指示后，有的已经纠正了，有的正在纠正，有的还继续着。到了六月中旬，市总工会才有重点的搞典型，也初步地摸索到一些经验。
    在这一段工作中虽然走了些弯路，但也作出了一定的成绩，干部、工人的认识是提高了一步的；并且取得了一些经验教训：（一）事实证明：新解放区工厂有了两三个月的工作，同样可以开展民主运动，这是无须再怀疑的了。起初认为新解放区条件不成熟的想法，只能说明我们对依靠工人阶级管理工厂的思想还模糊不清；同时也不知道民主运动就是用实际行动创造“成熟的条件”的过程；（二）必须自上而下展开批评与自我批评；上级不检讨，光叫别人检讨，运动自然会一点也展不开；但光是几个主要负责人检讨了也是不够的，必须是主要负责同志首先做深刻检讨，一般的干部同志也同样的检讨，甚至是我们准备留用的旧职员，也必须向群众进行检讨，改正过去的旧作风。只有这样，威信才能提高，运动才能展开了，工人才能积极提意见，工作也就不难推进了；（三）必须通过一定的组织形式，——最好就是召开职工代表会议。没有这一组织的话，将会形成无组织无领导的现象，意见不容易集中起来和贯彻下去，因零碎的征求，群众会认为对他们的意见不尊重；（四）党、政、工、团，必须互相配合，一致行动。必须弄清楚，工厂中党、政、工、团的共同任务，就是恢复和发展生产。同时，管理民主化和完成生产任务是分不开的，所以它决不会影响生产；同时是发展生产的第一步；（五）批评与自我批评要和解决实际问题相结合：工人看问题是从实际出发的，我们应该说到做到，决不拖拉。如果运动是展开了，工人意见也提了几百条，领导也认为“对工作帮助很大”，因而，就以为已经万事大吉，但如果不去执行的话，那运动就会等于白搭。
