　　Zhangjiakou City, after Full Preparation,
  　Gradually Reforms District and Street Political Power
    [Zhangjiakou News] Zhangjiakou Municipal Government began piloting the reform of street political power organizations and the establishment of street police stations in Guhongmiao Street and Mingde North Street in the Third District in early July, and gained experience. In mid-July, the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau each sent special personnel to Beijing to learn from the experience of reforming district and street political power organizations and establishing street public security police stations. In early August, after full discussion and research by the main responsible cadres of the Municipal Government, it was unanimously agreed that reforming district and street political power organizations and establishing street public security police stations were important tasks in Zhangjiakou's various constructions. On the 15th of this month, the Municipal Government made a decision to reform district and street political power organizations and public security bureau police stations: abolish street political power organizations, establish street public security police stations, directly under the leadership of the public security sub-bureaus of each district; abolish the district governments, all changed to district public offices. At the same time, clear provisions were made regarding the nature and specific tasks of the police stations and district public offices. The decision also pointed out several issues that should be paid attention to in implementing this reform work: that is, to universally convene district and street cadres to conduct mobilization and explanation on the significance of abolishing street governments and strengthening police stations, so that everyone has a clear understanding. Secondly, in the transition work, preparations should be made in advance to prevent chaos from occurring, so as not to cause losses to the work. The district government should study the social situation and work conditions of each street in detail to prevent simplification of work. Finally, the steps of work should not be uniform in each district. The Third District has carried out transformation experiments, and the First and Second Districts should carry out transformation after full deliberation and preparation. Generally, the reform is required to be completed before September 15.

　　张市经过充分准备
  　逐步改革区街政权
    【张垣讯】张家口市政府在七月初开始在三区古宏庙街、明德北大街，试办改革街政权组织及建立街派出所，吸取了经验。七月中，市委、市政府、市公安局，均分别派专人到北平市学习改革区街政权组织及建立街公安派出所的经验。八月初旬，又经市府主要负责干部充分的讨论研究，都一致认为，改革区街政权组织，和建立街公安派出所，是目前张市各项建设中的重要一项。本月十五日，市府遂作出改革区街政权组织及公安局派出所的决定：取消街政权组织，建立街公安派出所，受各区公安分局直接领导；取消各区政府，一律改为区公所。同时对派出所及区公所的性质与具体任务作出明白的规定。决定中，又指出执行这一改革工作所应注意几个问题：即对取消街政府加强派出所的意义，要普遍召开区街干部进行动员解释，使大家有明确认识。其次，在交替工作中，应事先准备好，防止混乱现象发生，以免工作受到损失。区政府应把每街的社会情况，工作情形详细加以研究，防止工作简单化。最后，在工作步骤上各区不必统一，三区已进行改造试验，一、二区应经过充分的酝酿准备后，再进行改造，一般要求在九月十五日以前改革完毕。
