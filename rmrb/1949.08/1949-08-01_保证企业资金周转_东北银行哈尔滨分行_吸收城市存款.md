    Ensuring Enterprise Capital Turnover
    Northeast Bank Harbin Branch
    Absorbs Urban Deposits
    [Harbin News] The Harbin Branch of the Northeast Bank focuses on absorbing urban deposits and channeling them to state-owned, municipal, and various production enterprises that are beneficial to the integration of urban and rural areas. It also pays special attention to the deposits of public enterprises and government agencies. Currently, there are an average of 200 new depositing units of public enterprises and agencies each month. From the beginning, the bank proactively understands the financial, production, income, expenditure, and sales situations of each unit. It often urges them to deposit funds after each sale of finished products. Factories in the suburbs find it inconvenient to travel back and forth, so the bank uses cars to pick them up and sends personnel to regularly contact the accountants of each unit. Almost all the larger public enterprises have been able to deposit all their daily surplus funds into the state bank. The factories under the Municipal Industrial Corporation deposit no more than 10 million Northeast currency units in their treasuries after daily sales. The Provincial Department of Commerce, except for retaining the food allowance for the supply system, also sends all the remaining funds to the bank. In this way, the bank can always maintain sufficient inventory to supply the legitimate turnover needs of various enterprise departments. In the past six months, the Industrial Corporation has borrowed 22 billion Northeast currency units from the bank, which has developed production. The Chemical Factory directly under the Industrial Corporation immediately added equipment for making soda ash after receiving 3 billion in cash. Regarding support for cooperatives, the bank specifically allocated 2,000 tons of grain converted into cash, of which 2.018 billion Northeast currency units have already been lent out.

    保证企业资金周转
    东北银行哈尔滨分行
    吸收城市存款
    【哈尔滨讯】东北银行哈尔滨分行，着重吸收城市存款周转到国、盛市企业和有利城乡结合的各种生产事业上去。又特别抓紧公营企业和机关存款。现在公营企业和机关每月平均都有存户二百家。银行也一开始就主动了解各个单位的资金、生产、收支、销货等状况，常在每次销出成品后，就催着来存款，市郊区的工厂感到来往不便，银行便用汽车去接，且派人经常和各单位的会计联系，比较大的公营企业差不多已做到把每天余款全部交国家银行。市营实业公司所属各工厂，每天卖货后库里存款不超过一千万元。省商业厅除了留出供给制的菜金以外，也全部送到银行。这样，银行可以经常保持足够库存，供给各企业部门的正当周转。半年来实业公司从银行借去东北币二百二十亿元，发展了生产。实业公司直属化学工厂得到三十亿元现款后，马上添上了做曹达灰的装置。对合作社的扶植，银行专拿出二千吨粮折成现款，已经借出东北币二十亿零一百八十万元。
