    Taiyuan Region Determines Production Focus
    Prepares to Plant Wheat
    [Taiyuan News] The CCP Taiyuan District Committee held a meeting of county office directors at the end of July, determining that the focus of agricultural production leadership in the Taiyuan region should be on intensifying summer hoeing to protect seedlings and prevent floods, while also mobilizing farmers to prepare for wheat planting. This year, the wheat fields in the region suffered from spring drought, especially hail, jaundice, black jaundice, and various insect pests, resulting in a poor harvest. Many wheat-producing areas have residual diseases, and some villages suffered from sprouting due to water damage. The planned field selection of seeds was not carried out in most areas. In severely affected areas, the harvest was only enough for the original seeds. In the recovery areas, villages in disaster areas had already exchanged green crops for other foods during the spring famine, so wheat seeds are extremely scarce. To supplement the food shortage, the masses in various places are worried about land changes after autumn, and after the summer harvest, a large amount of wheat land will be returned to autumn fields, reducing the wheat land area. Fertilizer is also generally felt to be insufficient. Based on the above situation, the meeting determined that it is necessary to seize the season (only forty days before the White Dew wheat planting), mobilize farmers to complete wheat planting preparations, and turn over the wheat fields. Pingyao, Jiexiu and other counties have already plowed most of the wheat fields for the first time. The entire region should strive to plow two to three times. Plowed land in the summer is an important guarantee for reducing wheat field diseases and insect pests in the coming spring. In addition, widely publicize and reward the policy of reclaiming wasteland, vigorously reclaim wasteland in the summer, and achieve the plan of exceeding 70% of the total amount of wasteland eliminated in the region. When plowing the land, also adapt to local conditions, implement more plowing, apply soil medicine (such as ferrous sulfate and homemade medicinal materials), kill insect pests and their eggs, and earnestly solve the difficulties of labor and livestock for revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, cadres' families, and widowed and orphaned farmers. Regarding the seed problem, mobilize the masses to select seeds immediately, mainly by calling for mutual assistance and borrowing, and preventing waste. In areas with greater difficulties, the Special Zone and counties should organize the adjustment and exchange between counties and regions, and trading companies should assist in solving the problem. If individual areas do need loan assistance, the counties should quickly report to the Special Commissioner's Office for submission to the municipal government for approval and resolve the issue as soon as possible. Before sowing, educate the masses to adopt methods such as soaking seeds in water to reduce the occurrence of diseases and insect pests. In addition, attention should be paid to pressing green manure and composting manure to ensure that no barren land is sown, so as to lay the foundation for expanding cultivated land area and increasing production next year.

    太原区确定生产重点
    准备种麦
    【太原讯】中共三地委七月底召开的各县办公室主任会议上，确定太原区在目前农业生产领导上，除抓紧夏锄保苗防洪外，同时应发动农民进行种麦准备。该区今年麦田入春天旱，尤其遭到冰雹、黄疸、黑疸、及各种虫灾，致造成歉收，且不少产麦中遗留病害，部分村庄并因水害生芽，原计划的田间选种，大部地区未进行，灾重区收成仅够原来种籽，恢复区灾村春荒时已指青换吃了其他食品，故麦种奇缺。各地群众为补助食粮不足，恐怕秋后土地变动，夏收后，又将大量麦地回茬成秋田，使麦地减少。肥料则普遍感到不足。会议根据上述情况，确定：应抓紧季节（距白露种麦只有四十天时间），发动农民完成种麦准备，翻好麦地。平、介等县已将麦田大部刹过头遍，全区应争取翻到二至三遍。伏刹地是减少明春麦地病虫害的重要保障之一。此外广泛宣传奖励开荒政策，大力开伏荒，达到全区超过消灭荒地总数百分之七十的计划。翻地时，亦以地制宜，贯彻多翻、下地药（如黑矾及土制药材等），杀灭虫害及其卵子，并认真解决烈、军、干属与孤寡农民之劳畜力困难。关于种籽问题，发动群众立即选种，主要是号召互助互借、防止浪费。困难较大地区，由专区、县掌握组织县与县、区与区间的调剂互换，贸易公司协助解决。如确有个别地区需要贷款扶助者，各县应速报专署转呈市府批核，及早解决。下种前教育群众采用水浸种籽等办法减轻病、虫害发生，另应注意压绿肥、沤粪，保证不种素地，借以打下明年扩大耕地面积与增产的基础。（明）
