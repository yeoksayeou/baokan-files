    Dependents of Southbound Work Corps Members
    to Receive Military Dependents' Benefits
    Mr. Editor:
    My family moved to Beiping from Jiaocheng County, Central Hebei District in the 13th year of the Republic of China (1924), and owns several acres of land. Now my youngest son has joined the Southbound Work Corps to dedicate himself to the revolutionary cause. If I return home, can I be allocated land according to the revolutionary family member policy?
    If land can be allocated, how will it be allocated? What are the procedures? Which authorities should I contact? Please provide detailed information on everything.
    Li Chunqiao

    Mr. Li Chunqiao:
    The Beiping Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau has provided the following response to your question:
    Dependents of the Southbound Work Corps members receive military dependents' benefits, but the family members still retain their cadre family status. There will be no problem in obtaining land during land redistribution. You can take the family member certificate issued by the Southbound Work Corps to the local government for consultation and processing.

    南工团团员家属
    按军属待遇
    编者先生：
    我家于民国十三年即由冀中区交河县迁居北平，家中有地产数亩。今次子入南下工作团，献身革命事业，如果我回家可能按革命家属办法分地否？
    假如可以分地，如何分法？有什么手续？向什么机关办理？请详细赐知一切为盼。          
    李春樵
    李春樵先生：
    你的问题承北平市人民政府民政局答复如下。
    南下工作团团员家属按军属待遇，家属仍是干属地位。土地平分时，分得土地更无问题。可持南工团所发家属证明，向所在地区政府接洽，即可办理。
