    [Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station, 21st Dispatch] Yesterday, the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee invited representatives from the city's industrial sector to a symposium to discuss how to overcome difficulties, develop inland transportation, break the blockade, and restore production. Over a hundred people attended, including Sheng Pihua, Hu Juewen, and Zhang Jingguo. Chen Yun, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, along with Rao Shushi, also the Secretary of the Municipal Committee, and Mayor Chen Yi, as well as Deputy Mayors Zeng Shan and Pan Hannian, were present. Comrade Rao Shushi presided over the meeting and delivered the opening remarks. Comrade Chen Yun was then invited to speak amidst enthusiastic applause. Comrade Chen Yun spoke for an hour and a half. He first provided a clear and concise analysis of the various difficulties currently faced by the government and the people. He then pointed out that these difficulties are those encountered during a victorious advance, that they are temporary, and that they can be overcome. He then briefly outlined possible solutions and directions for addressing specific difficulties in Shanghai, including industrial production, the supply of grain and cotton, transportation and sales, industrial capital, and the resettlement of former civil servants. Speaking about Shanghai's future, Comrade Chen Yun pointed out that the era of relying on imperialist speculation and trickery is over. He expressed hope that the people and the government would work together to maintain the production of key industries and major sectors to overcome the current difficulties. At the same time, regarding the prospects for the new Shanghai, Comrade Chen Yun forcefully and clearly stated that a unified and independent New China with 475 million people will emerge in the near future. Under the leadership of a unified people's government, both public and private enterprises can obtain conditions for full development. At that time, Shanghai's products can be sold throughout the country, and the future is very promising. Following this, industry representatives put forward many positive suggestions and exchanged many useful opinions.
