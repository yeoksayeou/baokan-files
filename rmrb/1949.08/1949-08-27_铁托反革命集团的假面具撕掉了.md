　　The Mask of the Tito Counter-Revolutionary Clique is Torn Off

　　The Soviet government's repeated notes to the Yugoslav government recently have sternly condemned the Tito counter-revolutionary clique's anti-Soviet conspiracy and sharply exposed the ugly faces of this small group of lying rogues and traitors. These notes are an important contribution to safeguarding world peace and an important education for the people of the world.

　　Opposing the Soviet Union inevitably leads to surrendering to imperialism, inevitably makes one an enemy of one's own people, and inevitably leads to the path of fascist destruction. People can find sufficient evidence of this truth in the criminal facts of the revolutionary traitor Tito clique over the past year.

　　A year ago, the Tito clique advocated the self-deceiving fallacy of "being able to independently embark on a socialist society without the assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries," and broke away from the international socialist and democratic camp. At that time, the Information Bureau of the European Communist Parties accurately pointed out in its resolution on the Yugoslav Communist Party issue: "This anti-Soviet stance is incompatible with Marxism-Leninism." This historically significant resolution foresaw the various erroneous domestic and foreign policies of the Yugoslav Communist Party, which would "endanger the very survival of the Yugoslav Communist Party and ultimately contain a danger of the degeneration of the People's Republic of Yugoslavia." The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in its "Resolution on the Yugoslav Communist Party Issue," also pointed out that Tito's rebellious behavior "has seriously damaged the cause of the Yugoslav people and made Yugoslavia's enemies rejoice." The development of the objective situation over the past year has fully proved the correctness of this assertion.

　　Yugoslavia in the past year, under the control of the Tito clique, has completely changed its nature—from a people's democratic country to a fascist political prison where capitalist elements are the determining force and everything is ruled by the secret police.

　　Yugoslavia in the past year is no longer a member of the international democratic camp, but has been sold by the Tito clique to imperialism and has become an outpost for imperialism to oppose the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The logic of history has made the Tito clique an open running dog of imperialism. The Yugoslav traitors have now openly requested loans from the American reactionaries to sell themselves, have offered major war materials such as steel, chromium, zinc, and lead to American and British monopoly capitalists, and have obtained military equipment from the imperialists to use against the Soviet Union and the people. In order to please their masters, the Tito gang cooperated with the American and British "Cold War" policy and carried out unscrupulous provocative acts around their borders and among the neighboring peoples of Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Albania. The Tito clique once attempted to annex Albania and even Bulgaria as colonies. They colluded with the Greek butcher Tsaldaris, allowing the royalist fascist army to penetrate the rear of the Greek Democratic Army through Yugoslav territory. On the Hungarian border, Yugoslav reactionaries repeatedly killed Hungarian sentries, creating border incidents. In Romania, Yugoslav reactionaries carried out secret agent activities, distributing fascist leaflets opposing the people's democratic regime. Yugoslav reactionaries also secretly sold the interests of the Slovenian minority in Austria to the American and British governments in exchange for the favor of imperialism.

　　The Tito clique has carried out various slanderous and provocative actions against the great Soviet Union to obliterate the great assistance the Soviet Union gave to the Yugoslav people during the war and after the war. When carrying out these criminal activities, the Tito clique could not but take into account the friendship of the Yugoslav people and the true Yugoslav communists for the Soviet Union, and therefore had to adopt various shameless two-faced tactics. The recent arrest of Soviet expatriates is a typical example: clearly the real reason why the Tito clique arrested Soviet citizens was because they did not approve of the Tito clique's hostile policy towards the Soviet Union, but they reversed black and white, falsely accusing Soviet citizens of "having anti-Soviet activities." However, the Soviet government sternly refuted the deception of the Yugoslav counter-revolutionary government and announced the whole truth about the Yugoslav government's persecution of Soviet expatriates.

　　We warmly support the Soviet government's repeated notes on the Yugoslav question concerning Austria, the question of revolutionary exiles in the Soviet Union, and the persecution of Soviet expatriates by the Yugoslav government. As the Soviet note pointed out: "One should not confuse the attitude of the Soviet government towards the current Yugoslav government with its attitude towards Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav people." The Yugoslav government is our enemy, while the Yugoslav people are our comrades-in-arms in the common struggle against the imperialist Tito clique, and should be given deep sympathy. Their support for the Soviet Union has been consistent. In the anti-fascist battles, they fought bravely against Hitler, Mussolini, and Mihailović. After the war, they worked together with the true communists in the country to build a great motherland. Now, under Tito's rule, they are engaged in a heroic struggle, and countless people have been persecuted by the gang. The support of the people of the world will further encourage their struggle. It is believed that the people of all nationalities in Yugoslavia will overcome difficulties, break through the darkness, and move towards the light.

　　At the same time, this historical fact has also deeply educated the Chinese working class and other classes in the Chinese democratic movement. The development of logic fully proves the instructions of the great people's leader Chairman Mao: "The Chinese must either lean to the side of imperialism or to the side of socialism, without exception. Straddling the fence is not possible, and there is no third way." "Wanting to oppose imperialism and also opposing the Soviet Union" is a completely contradictory and unworkable fantasy. To oppose imperialism, one must unite with the Soviet Union; opposing the Soviet Union inevitably leads to reliance on imperialism. Tito's "independently implementing socialism" nonsense is completely counter-revolutionary and shameless deception. Facts are the best witness. Now, hasn't the Tito government openly stood on the side of imperialism, ready to enter the grave with imperialism? Due to the betrayal of the Tito clique, the fruits of people's democracy in Yugoslavia have been usurped, and replaced by the bloody rule of fascism. We should deeply remember this lesson. "The entire world is currently divided into two camps—one is the camp of imperialism and war, and the other is the camp of socialism and peace. Strengthening the cooperation of all socialist and democratic forces with the Soviet Union is of particularly great importance" (see Voroshilov's speech on the Romanian National Day). Only by firmly standing on the side of the Soviet Union, only by resolutely implementing the foreign policy of the peace and democracy camp, can we guarantee our hard-won democratic fruits and victory, and gradually move towards the truly happy state of mankind. We hope that Communist Party members and democrats in all regions will use the Soviet notes to Yugoslavia to deeply study the lessons of the Tito clique's betrayal, widely publicize the Soviet Union's solemn attitude towards the Yugoslav issue, and thereby enhance the internationalist revolutionary education of the entire party and the entire nation.

### 铁托反革命集团的假面具撕掉了

　　铁托反革命集团的假面具撕掉了
    苏联政府最近对南斯拉夫政府的迭次照会，严正谴责铁托反革命集团反苏阴谋，尖锐地揭露了这一小撮说谎的流氓和卖国贼的丑恶面目。这些照会对保卫世界和平是一个重要的贡献，对全世界人民是一个重要的教育。
    反对苏联，必然要投降帝国主义，必然成为本国人民的敌人，必然要走上法西斯的灭亡的道路，这一条真理，人们可以从革命叛徒铁托集团一年来的罪恶事实中找到足够的证据。
    一年以前，铁托集团曾鼓吹所谓“不要苏联及人民民主国家的援助，便可以独自走上社会主义的社会”的自欺欺人的谬论，脱离了国际社会主义和民主的阵营。当时，欧洲共产党情报局在其关于南斯拉夫共产党问题的决议中曾确切地指出：“这种反苏立场，是与马克思主义——列宁主义不相容的。”这个有历史意义的决议预见了南共对内对外各种错误政策，将“危害到南共本身的生存，而结果包含一种使南斯拉夫人民共和国蜕化的危险”。中国共产党中央委员会在“关于南共问题决议”中，也指出铁托这种叛逆行为“已经严重地损害了南斯拉夫人民事业，并使南斯拉夫的敌人欢呼”。一年来客观情势的发展，充分地证明这一论断的正确性。
    一年来的南斯拉夫，在铁托集团控制之下已经完全变了质——从人民民主国家变成资本主义分子为决定力量的、由秘密警察统治一切的法西斯的政治监狱了。
    一年来的南斯拉夫，再也不是国际民主阵营之一员，而是被铁托集团出卖给帝国主义，成了帝国主义反对苏联，反对人民民主国家一个前哨阵地。历史的逻辑，使铁托集团成了公开的帝国主义走狗。南斯拉夫的卖国贼们现在已经公开地向美国反动派要求卖身的贷款，已经将钢、铬、锌、铅等主要战争原料供献于美英独占资本家，并从帝国主义手里换取用来反苏反人民的军事装备了。为了讨好主子，铁托匪帮配合美英“冷战”政策，曾在他们的边境四周和匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚等邻族人民中进行了肆无忌惮地挑衅行为。铁托集团曾经妄图把阿尔巴尼亚甚至保加利亚并为殖民地。他们与希腊屠夫曹达利斯狼狈为奸，使保皇法西斯军得以通过南斯拉夫领土，渗入希腊民主军军队后方。在匈牙利边境，南斯拉夫的反动派一再杀死匈国哨兵，制造边境事件。在罗马尼亚，南国反动派曾进行秘密特务活动，散发反对人民民主政权的法西斯传单。南国反动派又向美英政府秘密出卖奥国境内斯洛文少数民族的利益，以换取帝国主义的欢心。
    对于伟大的苏联国家，铁托集团更是进行了种种毁谤和挑衅的行动，来抹杀苏联在战争时期和战后时期所给予南斯拉夫人民的伟大援助。铁托集团在进行这些罪恶活动时，不能不顾及南斯拉夫人民和南斯拉夫真正的共产主义者对于苏联的友谊，因此不能不采取种种无耻的两面手段。最近逮捕苏联侨民事件便是一个标本的例子：明明铁托集团逮捕苏联公民的真正原因是因为他们不赞成铁托集团对苏敌对政策，可是他们却颠倒黑白，诬赖苏联公民为“有反苏活动”。但是苏联政府严正地驳斥了南斯拉夫反革命政府的欺骗，并宣布了南斯拉夫政府迫害苏侨的全部真相。
    我们热烈拥护苏联政府关于南斯拉夫对奥要求问题、关于苏境革命流亡者问题，以及关于南斯拉夫政府迫害苏联侨民问题的历次照会。正如苏联照会中所指出的：“人们不应当把苏联政府对现时南斯拉夫政府的态度与它对南斯拉夫和对南斯拉夫人民的态度混淆起来”。南斯拉夫政府是我们的敌人，南国人民则是我们共同反对帝国主义铁托集团的战友，应寄予深切的同情。他们拥护苏联始终如一，在反法西斯战斗中，在反对希特勒、墨索里尼及米海洛维区斗争中曾经英勇奋战，在战后曾同国内真正的共产主义者共同建设伟大的祖国，现在在铁托统治下，他们正进行着英勇斗争，无数的人遭到了匪帮的迫害。世界上的人民对他们的支援将会更加鼓舞他们的斗争。相信南斯拉夫各族人民定会战胜困难，冲破黑暗，走向光明。
    同时，这一历史事实也深深地教育了中国工人阶级以及中国民主运动中的其他阶级。逻辑的发展完全证明了伟大人民领袖毛主席的指示：“中国人不是倒向帝国主义一边，就是倒向社会主义一边，绝无例外。骑墙是不行的，第三条道路是没有的。”“又要反对帝国主义，又要反对苏联，”这是完全矛盾的、行不通的幻想，反帝就必须联苏，反苏必然走向投靠帝国主义。铁托散布的“单独实行社会主义”的鬼话，完全是反革命的无耻欺骗。事实是最好的证人。现在，铁托政府不是已经公开站在帝国主义一边，准备同帝国主义一同走进坟墓中去了吗？由于铁托集团的背叛，南国人民民主的果实是被篡夺了，而代之以法西斯的血腥统治。这一教训，我们应当深切记取。“当前整个世界已分为两个阵营——一方是帝国主义与战争的阵营，一方是社会主义与和平的阵营。加强一切社会主义的及民主的力量与苏联的合作之必要性，就具有特别伟大的重要性”（见伏罗希洛夫在罗国庆日上的讲话）。只有坚决站在苏联这一边，只有坚决执行和平民主阵营的外交政策，才能保证我们既得的民主果实和胜利，才能逐步地走向人类真正的美满境地。我们希望，各地共产党人和民主分子，利用苏联给南斯拉夫的照会，深入地研究铁托集团背叛的教训，广泛地宣传苏联对南斯拉夫问题的严正态度，借以提高全党和全民族的国际主义的革命教育。
