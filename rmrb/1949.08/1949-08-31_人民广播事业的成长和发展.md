　　The Growth and Development of the People's Broadcasting Industry
　　Jin Feng
　　(1) From Yan'an to Beiping

　　On September 5, 1945, a small radio transmitter with an output of 300 watts in a Yan'an cave sent out its first cry, "Yan'an Xinhua Broadcasting Station, XNOK." This cry traveled at a speed of 300 million meters per second, and through simultaneous broadcasts from the Qiqihar, Handan, and Jin-Cha-Ji broadcasting stations that appeared shortly thereafter, flew to all of China. In a small mountain village in the Taihang Mountains, hundreds of cadres, soldiers, and peasants gathered around a radio receiver, "injured" after being seized from the Japanese invaders, listening intently to the voice from the location of the CCP Central Committee. In a university student dormitory in Shanghai, doors and windows were tightly closed, a student suppressed his wildly beating heart, tightly grasped a crude homemade crystal radio earpiece, and risked his life to listen to the voice from the free motherland.

　　On June 20, 1949, the Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station, one of the largest radio stations in the Far East, broadcast the recording of the speech by the Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao at the preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference. In the vast land of China that had been liberated, there were thirty-seven radio stations, fifty-five radio transmitters, using sixty-one wavelengths, broadcasting the recording simultaneously. More than a million radio receivers sounded at the same time, and tens of millions of Chinese people joyfully and clearly heard the voice of their leader.

　　From Yan'an to Beiping, the rapid growth and development of the people's broadcasting industry symbolizes the unprecedented victory of the Chinese revolution. From remote mountain valleys to modern metropolises, the people's radio stations, using standard Mandarin, Cantonese, Teochew dialect, English, and Japanese, continuously broadcast the voice of victory to the people of the whole country, overseas Chinese, and friends all over the world every day.

　　(2) Growing Up in Struggle

　　As early as 1922, when the radio broadcasting industry was just emerging in the world, Lenin, the great teacher of the world revolution, pointed out to Stalin and the members of the Politburo of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) that this new scientific propaganda weapon could be used more effectively for propaganda and agitation, especially for the masses of illiterate residents. Lenin pointed out: In cases where bourgeois social science professors are not suitable, it is very necessary to have a few communists who can teach social sciences give extensive lectures to hundreds of places scattered throughout the republic via radio broadcasting. Lenin also said: Radio broadcasting is the best weapon for mass education, a university hall where tens of millions of people attend classes simultaneously, a newspaper without distance.

　　In China, the people's radio stations grew up in accordance with Lenin's instructions and according to the needs of the struggle.

　　During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries jointly used artillery, machine guns, pillboxes, barbed wire, and malicious rumors to build a blockade line, trying to isolate the people in the Japanese-occupied areas and the KMT-controlled areas from the anti-Japanese base areas led by the Chinese Communist Party. In the difficult war environment, the Chinese Communist Party repeatedly tried to establish a people's radio station in order to spread the voice of free China to all of China and the world. Due to limitations in material conditions, it was not until after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1945 that the first radio transmitter was installed in Yan'an using equipment transported in through the "blockade money." From then on, the Chinese people in the Kuomintang-ruled areas and overseas, as well as many civil and military officials of the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty, began to enthusiastically listen to "the broadcasts of the Xinhua Broadcasting Station." Liu Shanben, the KMT air force officer who flew to Yan'an in June 1946, his transformation was due to regularly listening to Yan'an broadcasts. During this period, the shameless Kuomintang reactionaries used "jamming stations" with several times the power to capture the voice of the Xinhua Broadcasting Station in the air, using noise with similar wavelengths to confuse the "Yan'an" voice, attempting to "block" the ears of the Chinese people. Our radio technicians displayed amazing creativity, cleverly and constantly changing the wavelengths and frequencies, making the Kuomintang's "jamming" fail, so that the voice of Yan'an constantly entered the ears of the people in the KMT-controlled areas at that time.

　　Our radio station workers overcame the most difficult period with superhuman efforts. In March 1947, Hu Zongnan's bandit troops invaded Yan'an, and the Yan'an Broadcasting Station tried to persist in broadcasting in the harsh combat environment. In Wayao Fort, a small mountain village more than a hundred miles away from Yan'an, in a land temple with an area of less than six square meters, two editors, two broadcasters, and several technicians continued to send out the voice of Yan'an, letting friends and enemies of the people of the whole world and China know that the Chinese Communist Party was here, persisting in the struggle.

　　(3) Growing Stronger in the Victory of the Revolution

　　From the end of 1948 to 1949, the people's broadcasting industry developed unprecedentedly. With the liberation of various cities and towns, we restored, took over, and transformed the original radio stations in various places into people's radio stations. In more well-known cities such as Beiping, Tianjin, Baoding, Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Qingdao, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Nanchang, Fuzhou, Tangshan, Qiqihar, Yanji, Andong, Mudanjiang, Jinzhou, Anshan, Yingkou, Tonghua, Fushun, Xuzhou, Nantong, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Shaoxing, etc., there were radio stations. On June 5, the CCP Central Committee decided to expand the oral broadcasting department originally under the Xinhua News Agency into the Central Broadcasting Administration, and the Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station became a national central station. The local people's radio stations worked under the leadership of the Central Broadcasting Administration. The broadcasting content of the local radio stations was very rich. In addition to political, economic, current affairs, cultural, scientific, and entertainment programs, they also organized rotating programs for workers, youth, women, and students, which played a certain role in promoting mass work. The broadcasting methods included news, communications, commentaries, speeches, systematic lectures, dramas, and music and songs. Many important meetings or speeches were recorded. The Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station had foreign language and local dialect broadcasts, and the local people's radio stations simultaneously broadcast the news and commentaries of the Xinhua Broadcasting Station. In order to adapt to the characteristics of Tianjin as an industrial and commercial city, the Tianjin People's Broadcasting Station also specially set up an economic station and a workers' station, focusing on reporting economic news and the workers' movement. From the first day of entering the city, the people's radio stations were considering how to first serve the working people of the city. In Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, Shenyang and other places, broadcasting groups were gradually established in factories and schools, organizing workers and students to broadcast and listen to the radio, and some achievements have been made.

　　(4) Overcoming Difficulties and Developing Forward

　　The widespread development of the broadcasting industry currently still faces many difficulties; the first is the problem of listeners and other material conditions. For example, most of the radio owners in China are currently families above the petty bourgeoisie. It is estimated that there are about two million radio receivers in the liberated areas now, but few workers in factories can use radio receivers, and there are even fewer in rural areas. There are also some shortcomings in the radio stations themselves: such as many newly participating staff members are not very familiar with the broadcasting business, the manuscripts edited are not very suitable for the requirements of "listening to the ear"; cultural and entertainment programs are not rich enough, etc.

　　"Difficulties must be overcome gradually." When the reporter recently visited the responsible comrade of the Central Broadcasting Administration, he said with infinite confidence. He said that now we must work hard to solve the problems of radio receivers and listeners. First of all, we must systematically and step by step help the organized masses in factories, barracks, schools, and organs solve the difficulties in listening to the radio. Try our best to improve and enrich the content of the broadcast to meet the needs of the audience, and gradually shift and transform the listening tastes of the general urban audience. In order to solve the problem of lack of cadres, we are preparing to systematically train radio editors, interviewers, broadcasters, and radio station technicians in the near future. He finally described the future prospects of China's broadcasting industry: increase radio stations, expand power, so that residents in most small and medium-sized cities and vast rural areas can hear the voice of the broadcast on our country's 10 million square kilometers of land. At the same time, we must also set up powerful international shortwave stations to transmit the voice of the Chinese people to the world!

　　人民广播事业的成长和发展
    金凤
　　（一）从延安到北平
    一九四五年九月五日，延安窑洞里的一个小小的输出电力三百瓦的广播机，发出了第一声“延安新华广播电台，ＸＮＯＫ”的呼声。这呼声以每秒钟三万万公尺的速度，并通过此后不久出现的齐齐哈尔、邯郸和晋察冀广播电台的连播，飞向全中国。在太行山的一个小山沟里，几百个干部、战士和农民，围着一架从日寇那里缴获来的，已经“受伤”了的收音机，聚精会神地倾听从中共中央所在地传来的声音；上海一个大学的学生宿舍里，门窗紧闭，一个学生按捺住狂跳的心，紧抓自制的简陋的矿石耳机，冒着生命的危险，倾听着从自由的祖国传来的声音。
    一九四九年六月二十日，远东最大的广播电台之一的北平新华广播电台，播送中国人民领袖毛主席在新政协筹备会上的讲演录音。在中国已经解放了的广大的土地上有三十七所广播电台，五十五部广播机，使用着六十一个波长，把录音联播出去，一百多万架收音机同时发声，千百万中国人民满心欢喜地清清楚楚地听到了自己领袖的声音。
    从延安到北平，人民广播事业的飞速成长和发展，正象征着中国革命空前的胜利。从山沟穷谷到现代化的大城市，人民的广播电台使用着普通国语，广州话，潮汕话，英语和日语，每天向全国人民、海外华侨和全世界的朋友不断播送着胜利的声音。
　　（二）从斗争中成长起来
    早在一九二二年，无线电广播事业在世界上还刚刚兴起时，世界革命的导师列宁就向史大林和联共中央政治局委员们指出：这种新的科学的宣传武器可以更有效地进行宣传鼓动，特别是对于不识字的居民群众。列宁指出：在资产阶级的社会科学教授不能适用的情况下，经过无线电广播，由能够讲授社会科学的少数共产主义者教授，给散处共和国的几百个地方广泛演讲，这是非常必要的。列宁又说：无线电广播是群众教育最好的武器，是数十百万人同时上课的大学堂，是没有距离的报纸。
    在中国，人民的广播电台是遵照列宁的指示，按着战斗需要而成长起来的。
    抗日战争中，日寇和国民党反动派共同使用大炮、机枪、碉堡，铁丝网和恶毒的谣言，筑起一条封锁线，想把日占区、蒋占区的人民和中共所领导的抗日根据地隔绝。中国共产党在艰苦的战争环境中，屡次试当建立人民的广播电台，以便把自由中国的呼声传播到全中国和全世界。由于物质条件的限制，一直到一九四五年抗日战争胜利后，使用通过“封锁钱”运进来的器材，才在延安装设起第一架广播机。从此以后，国民党统治区和海外的中国人民，以及蒋家王朝的许多文武官员，开始热心地收听“新华广播电台的广播”；一九四六年六月驾着飞机飞到延安的蒋家空军军官刘善本，他的转变就是由于经常收听延安广播。这时期，无耻的国民党反动派利用了电力强大几倍的“干扰电台”，在空中捕捉新华广播电台的声音，用波长相近的杂音来混淆“延安”的声音，企图“堵塞”中国人民的耳朵；我们的无线电技术人员，发挥了惊人的创造能力，巧妙地不断地变换着波长和周率，使国民党的“干扰”扑空，使延安的声音，始终不断地传入当时蒋占区人民的耳朵里。
    我们的广播电台工作人员以超人的努力渡过了最艰苦的时期。一九四七年三月胡宗南匪军进犯延安，延安广播电台在残酷的作战环境中设法坚持播音。在离延安一百多里的小山沟瓦窑堡，一间面积不满六平方公尺的土地庙里，两个编辑人员，两个广播员和几个技术人员，继续发出了延安的声音，让全世界和全中国的人民的朋友和敌人知道，中国共产党就在这里，坚持着斗争的。
　　（三）在革命的胜利中壮大了
    从一九四八年底到一九四九年，人民广播事业在空前地发展着。随着各大小城市的解放，我们将各地原有的电台恢复、接管、改造为人民广播电台。在较著名的城市如北平、天津、保定、张家口、承德、沈阳、长春、吉林、太原、西安、上海、南京、济南、青岛、杭州、武汉、南昌、福州、唐山、齐齐哈尔、延吉、安东、牡丹江、锦州、鞍山、营口、通化、抚顺、徐州、南通、苏州、无锡、常州、绍兴等，都有了广播电台。六月五日，中共中央决定将原属新华总社的口语广播部扩充为中央广播事业管理处，北平新华广播电台成为全国性的中央台，各地人民广播电台在中央广播事业管理处的领导下工作。各地的广播电台的广播内容很丰富，除了政治、经济、时事、文化、科学、文娱等节目外，并组织了职工、青年、妇女、学生的轮回简目，对于推动群众工作起了一定的作用。播送的方式则有新闻、通讯、评论、演讲、系统讲座、戏剧、音乐、歌曲等，许多重要的会议或演讲都作了录音。北平新华广播电台有外国语和地方方言广播，各地人民电台在同一时间内联播新华广播电台的新闻和评论。天津人民广播电台为了适应天津工商城市的特点，另外专设了经济台和职工台，着重报导经济消息和职工运动。人民的广播电台从入城的第一天起，就在考虑如何首先为城市的劳动人民服务。在北平、天津、济南、沈阳等地，在工厂和学校里逐步成立了广播小组，组织工人和学生到电台广播，收听，已取得一些成绩。
　　（四）克服困难，向前发展
    广播事业的普遍展开，在目前还有许多的困难；首先就是听众问题和其他物质条件的困难。例如，现在中国的收音机所有者大多数是小资产者以上的家庭，据估计现在解放区约有二百万架收音机，但工厂里的工人很少能使用收音机，农村里就更少了。在广播电台本身也还有若干缺点：如不少新参加的工作人员还不很熟悉广播的业务，编辑的稿件还不十分合乎“耳朵听”的要求；文艺娱乐节目还不够丰富等等。
    “困难是一定要逐步克服的”。记者最近访问中央广播事业管理处的负责同志时，他充满了无限的信心这样说。他说现在要努力解决收音机和听众对象的问题。首先要有计划有步骤地帮助工厂、兵营、学校、机关中的有组织群众解决收听广播的困难。尽力改善和丰富广播的内容，以适合听众的要求，并逐渐转移和改造一般市民听众的收听趣味。为解决干部缺乏的问题，准备在最近期内有计划地培养广播编辑、采访、广播员和电台技术人员。他最后描述了中国广播事业的远景：增加电台，扩大电力，使大部分中小城市和广大农村的居民，在我国一千万平方公里的土地上，都能听到广播的声音。同时，还要设立强大电力的国际短波台，将中国人民的声音传到全世界去！
