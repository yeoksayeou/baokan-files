    Summer Study Group Holds Closing Ceremony
    Comrade Peng Zhen Attends and Speaks
    Encouraging Students to Recognize the Times, Stand Firm, Overcome Individualism, and Overcome One-Sidedness
    [Our Newspaper] The municipal university and middle school students’ summer study group held a closing ceremony at the Peking University Democracy Square on the 11th, attended by more than 2,000 members of the study group. Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Peking Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Comrade Gao Tang, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, were present. The atmosphere on the square was joyous, with eleven red flags fluttering in the wind on top of the grey building. Portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin were hung in front of the teaching tents, and a huge statue of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu stood on the rostrum. Eye-catching white characters were displayed on bright red banners in front of the venue: "Consolidate learning achievements, firmly establish a worldview of serving the working people, continue to study revolutionary theory, master science and technology, forever follow the Communist Party, and be good students of Chairman Mao."

    The conference began at 11:15. After the chairman delivered a speech, Comrade Peng Zhen spoke first. He congratulated the students on their successful studies and pointed out: Young people must follow Chairman Mao. He said: The era of feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism is over. Our youth should not be buried with them as golden boys and jade girls. Now is a new era, the era of the proletariat. We are the youth of the new era, and we must recognize the times, stand at the forefront of the times, choose the proletariat, which represents the development of history, as our own class stance, and promote the progress of history. Chairman Mao is the representative of the proletariat, and we must learn from Chairman Mao and follow Chairman Mao. Then, Comrade Peng Zhen reminded everyone: If we want to stand firm on the proletarian class stance and become a driving force for historical progress, we must overcome individualism in ideology, one-sidedness in methodology, and the problem of looking at things superficially. Finally, Comrade Peng Zhen called on the students to study the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao, and obtain theoretical guidance from them. We should consult with the masses on matters at work, so that all problems can be solved.

    Next, Comrade Zhang Dazhong, director of the summer study group, spoke, first pointing out the gains of this stage of study. He said that the students have learned "History of Social Development" and "Youth Work" in the past month, and have begun to experience the truth that labor creates the world, learned revolutionary theory and revolutionary work to transform themselves, and improved themselves a step further. In the past month, they have also learned the learning method of linking theory with practice, which is all due to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. He also put forward the direction of future efforts—to ask students to guard against arrogance and impetuosity, to be good at using the learning methods they have acquired, and to widely unite with students to work together and move forward together.

    Mr. Tang Yongtong, Chairman of the Peking University Affairs Committee, also came to participate in the ceremony in the afternoon. He warmly congratulated the success of the study group and hoped that everyone would continue to work hard.

    The representative of the Peking University Student Union delivered an enthusiastic speech, expressing infinite admiration for the students' diligent study attitude, and hoped that the students would successfully complete the task of organizing learning after returning to school. Later, the representative of the second class of the second group of the study group paid tribute to all the working cadres. Finally, everyone shouted slogans and dispersed in the song "Youth, Fiery Heart, Advance with Mao Zedong:…"

    彭真同志出席讲话
    勉同学认清时代站稳立场克服个人主义克服片面性
    【本报讯】本市大中学生暑期学习团于十一日在北大民主广场举行结业典礼，到全体学习团员两千余名。中共北平市委会书记彭真同志和青年团中央委员高棠同志均莅临参加。广场上嘉气洋溢，灰楼顶上十一面红旗迎风招展，课棚前高悬马恩列斯画像，耸立在主席台上的则是毛主席、朱总司令的巨像。会场前挂着鲜艳的红布标语，醒目的显着白字：“巩固学习成果，坚定为劳动人民服务的人生观，继续学习革命理论，掌握科学技术，永远跟着共产党，做毛主席的好学生”。
    十一时一刻，大会开始，主席致词后，首由彭真同志讲话，他庆祝同学们的学习成功，并且指出：青年们要跟着毛主席走。他说：封建主义、帝国主义和官僚资本主义的时代过去了，我们青年不要作他们殉葬的金童玉女，现在是新时代，是无产阶级的时代，我们是新时代的青年，要认清时代，站在时代的最前列，选定代表历史发展的无产阶级，作为自己的阶级立场，推动历史前进。毛主席是无产阶级的代表，我们要学习毛主席，跟着毛主席走。接着，彭真同志提醒大家：我们要站稳无产阶级的阶级立场、成为历史前进的动力，就必须克服思想意识上的个人主义和思想方法的片面性以及从表面看问题的毛病。最后彭真同志号召同学们学习马恩列斯和毛主席的著作，从他们那里取得理论指导，在工作中有事要和群众商量，这样所有问题都可获得解决。
    接着是暑期学习团主任张大中同志讲话，首先指出这一阶段学习的收获，他说，同学们一月来学了“社会发展史”与“青年工作”，开始体验到劳动创造世界的真理，学习了革命理论与革命工作来改造自己，把自己提高了一步。一月来，并学到了理论联系实际的学习方法，这都是由于中国共产党的领导始有此收获。他又提出今后努力方向——要同学们戒骄戒躁，要善于运用已获得的学习方法，广泛地团结同学共同努力、共同前进。
    北大校务委员会主席汤用彤先生下午也来参加了这个典礼，他热烈祝贺学习团的成功，并希望大家继续努力。
    北大学生会代表热情的致词，对学习团同学们孜孜不倦的学习态度表示无限的敬仰，并希望同学们回学校后胜利的完成组织学习的任务。以后是学习团二分团二班同学代表向全体工作干部致敬。最后，大家高呼口号，在“青年人、火热的心、跟着毛泽东前进：…”的歌声中散会。
