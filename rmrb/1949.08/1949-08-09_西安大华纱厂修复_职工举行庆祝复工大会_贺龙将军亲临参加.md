    Workers Hold Celebration Rally for Resumption of Work
    General He Long Attends in Person
    [Dispatch from this newspaper] Xi'an News: The privately-owned Xi'an Dahua Cotton Mill, which was brutally sabotaged by bandits during their escape, has been completely restored and has resumed production. The mill's workers began emergency repairs on May 25th and completed the majority of the restoration by June 19th, completing the original 45-day resumption plan ahead of schedule. On the 20th, 7,049 spindles were spinning, producing 4,730 pounds of yarn. During the day, 354 looms were running, and at night, 374 looms were running, producing a total of 347 bolts of cloth. On the 21st, the number of spindles operating increased to 11,000 (equivalent to one-third of the original number), and the number of looms operating also increased to 400 (equivalent to one-half of the original number). By the 27th, nearly 30,000 spindles and 800 looms were all running under the hands of more than 2,000 workers. The workers held a grand celebration rally for the resumption of work on the 27th. At the meeting, General He Long called on all workers and private entrepreneurs to unite and cooperate under the leadership of the Communist Party and continue to work hard to develop production and support the front lines.
