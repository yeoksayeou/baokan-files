Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 5th. DPA, Munich dispatch: On August 2nd, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Bradley, while inspecting U.S. troops at Fort Grary in Bavaria, the U.S. occupation zone of Germany, declared that West Germany would continue to be occupied for a long period. He said that the American military establishment would not be reduced even after the so-called West German state was established. Well-informed sources said that Bradley adopted the suggestion of the U.S. Army Headquarters in Germany to establish the main line of defense for the American stronghold in Western Europe on the Rhine River. It is pointed out that these suggestions are not only for strategic considerations, but also in view of the growing social resistance in West Germany caused by the economic crisis, which will affect the attitude of Germans towards American policy.

    布莱德雷不打自招
    美阴谋长期占领西德
    【新华社北平五日电】德意志通讯社慕尼黑消息：八月二日，美陆军参谋长布莱德雷在德境美占区巴伐利亚州格拉里堡检阅美军时宣称，西德将继续被占领一个长时期。他说，美国的军事编制，即使在所谓西德国家建立之后也不会减少。消息灵通人士谈称，布莱德雷采纳德境美军总部的建议，在莱茵河上建立美国在西欧据点的主要防线。据指出，这些建议不仅是为了战略的考虑，而且也是鉴于因经济危机而引起的西德日渐增长的社会反抗将影响德人对美国政策的态度。
