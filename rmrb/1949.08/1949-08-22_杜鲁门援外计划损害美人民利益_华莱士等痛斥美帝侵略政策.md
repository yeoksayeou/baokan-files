Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 21st: Washington Dispatch: Progressive Party leader Wallace, while testifying before a Senate joint committee on the 19th, vehemently denounced Truman's military foreign aid plan as endangering the security of the United States and the entire world. Wallace said: Truman, in forcibly passing his $1.45 billion military foreign aid plan, used inexcusable fabrications to incite fear of the Soviet Union. The recent statements by Truman, Acheson, and the generals in Congress are the words of those who are deliberately instigating war and must use inflammatory and excited psychology to support their fragile cause. Wallace said: The cost of the military foreign aid plan will be the exhaustion of American resources and serious damage to the welfare and needs of the people; it is destined to fail. Based on the experience in Greece, Turkey, and China, any arms program planned by the government will not yield any results other than economic disaster. The plan to rearm Europe will simultaneously fatally damage the economies of the Marshallized countries and fuel unrest in those countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 21st: TASS, New York, August 19th: Mus, the secretary of the American delegation to the American Peace Congress, recently sent a letter to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, strongly protesting the United States' arming of the signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty. Mus wrote: The arms bill forces all of us to face the threat of economic crisis and war. Mus pointed out: The arms race launched by the warmongers has seriously affected many countries in the Americas. The warmongers have placed the heavy burden of military budgets on the masses of people in various countries, they obliterate the sovereignty of various countries, establish aggressive military blocs, lower the people's living standards, and infringe upon the people's rights. Mus continued: In the United States, persecution of progressives, blacks, and other minorities is proceeding in parallel with war preparations. Mus emphasized: The American people do not want war; they want economic prosperity. But the arms program forces the American people to face the threat of economic crisis and war.

  　华莱士等痛斥美帝侵略政策
    【新华社北平二十一日电】华盛顿讯：美进步党领袖华莱士十九日在参院联合委员会作证时，痛斥杜鲁门的军事援外计划将危害美国及全世界的安全。华莱士说：杜鲁门在强行通过他的十四亿五千万军事援外计划中，使用了不可饶恕的煽动对苏恐惧心理的捏造。杜鲁门、艾奇逊和将军们最近在国会中的言论，是蓄意挑拨战争国必须以煽动激动的心理来支持他们脆弱的事业的人的言论。华莱士说：军事援外计划的代价将是枯竭美国的资源，严重地损害人民的福利和需要，它是注定要失败的。根据在希腊、土耳其和中国的经验，政府所策划的任何武器计划除了经济灾难之外，得不到任何结果。重新武装欧洲的计划，将同时致命地损害马歇尔化国家的经济，助长这些国家中的不安。
    【新华社北平二十一日电】塔斯社纽约十九日讯：参加美洲和平大会的美国代表团秘书穆斯，顷致函美参院外委会，强烈抗议美国武装北大西洋公约的签字国。穆斯写道：武装法案迫使我们大家面临经济危机与战争的威胁。穆斯指出：战争贩子发动的军备竞赛，已经严重地影响了美洲许多国家。战争贩子已经把军事预算的沉重负担压在各国人民大众的身上，他们抹煞各国的主权，建立侵略性的军事集团，降低人民的生活标准，侵犯人民的权利。穆斯继称：在美国，与准备战争同时并进的是对于进步分子、黑人及其他少数民族的迫害，穆斯强调指出：美国人民不要战争，他们要的是经济繁荣。但是军备计划迫使美国人民面临经济危机与战争的威胁。
