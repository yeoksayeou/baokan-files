    Northeast Issues Order to Strictly Prevent Fires and Protect State Property
    Northeast Daily Calls for Strengthening Responsibility and Improving Systems
    [Report from this newspaper, Shenyang]: Since April of this year, fires have broken out successively in the Alshan Forestry Area, the Nancha Cold Storage, the Mashan Electrical Factory, the Linkou Gucheng Lumber Mill, and other places, causing significant losses to state property. In the Alshan Forestry Area, the construction area of the Yier railway line from Baichengzi to Alshan caused a fire by burning the weeds on both sides of the roadbed. The fire burned an area of forest 200 li long and 150 li wide. Valued at the lowest cost, the total loss is estimated at 25.4 million yuan. The Nancha Cold Storage was completely destroyed by arson committed by counter-revolutionaries, resulting in the loss of 50,615 cubic meters of the best logs, worth over 10 million yuan. The Linkou Gucheng Lumber Mill and the Mashan Electrical Factory were also completely destroyed due to inadequate precautions. The Northeast Administrative Committee, after ordering the Ministry of Public Security to send personnel to investigate the incidents on site, issued an order on the 2nd of this month. The order called for meting out punishments to the main persons responsible for causing these incidents: Ling Xue, construction foreman of the Yier construction area; Sun Yunpeng, chief of the Suolun engineering section; Wang Qiqing, director of the Nancha Cold Storage Branch; Xin Changwen, director of the Yichun Second Operations Office; Jiang Yunzhong, director of the Linkou Gucheng Lumber Mill; Han Xi, director of the Linkou Gucheng Forestry Bureau; Zhang Fuzhu, director of the Mashan Electrical Factory; Li Shangjin, deputy director; and Song Zhimin, draftsman. Personnel who bravely fought the fires were commended. The order also instructed all public enterprises, factories, mines, and government agencies to learn from these incidents, conduct thorough inspections, and develop concrete fire prevention measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future.
    [Report from this newspaper, Shenyang]: On the 12th, the Northeast Daily published an editorial entitled "Strengthen Responsibility, Improve Systems, and Conscientiously Protect State Property." The editorial pointed out: In April and May of this year, several fire incidents occurred in the Alshan Forestry Area of Inner Mongolia and other places, causing significant losses to the property of the people's motherland. This must arouse the attention and vigilance of all enterprise cadres in various regions, who should conduct inspections and corrections. Furthermore, they should take this as a lesson to carefully review their own work, educate all employees, strengthen responsibility, improve various management systems, regularly conduct in-depth inspections and supervision, establish a holistic perspective, and conscientiously protect state property.
