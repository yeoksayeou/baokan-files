[This City News] The Seventh District People's Government of this city achieved remarkable results in its trial implementation of classifying types and collectively mediating housing disputes in July. In the past, because the district mediation section adopted a case-by-case mediation approach, the mediation force was dispersed and unable to explain the People's Government's urban housing policy in detail to both landlords and tenants, resulting in low work efficiency. For example, the Seventh District accepted 84 housing dispute cases in June, but only 51 were mediated and resolved that month, and only 35 were successfully mediated, with each cadre handling less than two cases per day on average, and successfully mediating less than one. In response to this situation, the Seventh District People's Government decided to try a collective mediation method. On July 13th and 21st, it convened two symposiums for both parties involved in similar types of cases. Cadres from the mediation section explained the policies in detail, analyzed the causes of disputes, exposed and corrected the erroneous thinking of both parties, and hoped that both parties would negotiate on their own after the meeting based on the principle of mutual benefit. The results of the two experiments were good. Among the seven cases in the first collective mediation, six were resolved amicably on their own, and in the second group of five cases, one reached an agreement on the spot, and two were resolved amicably on their own after the meeting. Each meeting took only two hours, and nine cases were successfully mediated in two sessions, compared with 35 cases successfully mediated in the entire month of June. Work efficiency has increased more than tenfold; the nine cases successfully mediated in the two collective mediations accounted for 75% of the twelve cases mediated, while the 35 cases successfully mediated in June accounted for less than 50% of the 84 cases mediated.

    分别类型详细解释政策
    集体解决房屋纠纷
    七区试行结果工作效率大大提高
    【本市讯】本市第七区区公所，七月份试行分别类型、集体调解房屋纠纷，获得了显著的成绩。在过去，由于区调解科采取逐案调解的工作方式，调解力量分散，无法对房东、房客双方详尽地解释人民政府城市房屋政策，因之工作效率不高。如七区六月份受理的房和纠纷有八十四件，而当月经调解处理的只有五十一件，调解成立的只有三十五件，平均每个干部每天处理不到二件，成立不到一件。针对此种情况，七区区公所决定试行集体调解的办法，于七月十三日与二十一日分别召集同类型诸案件的双方当事人举行了两次座谈会，由调解科的干部详细说明政策，分析发生纠纷的原因，揭露并纠正双方的错误思想，希望双方根据两利的原则，会后自行协商。两次试验的结果，效果良好，第一次集体调解的七件案子中，自行和解的有六件，第二次五件案子中，有一件当场即成立协议，会后自行和解的两件。每次会议所费不过两个钟头，两次就调解成立九件，比六月份全月成立三十五件，工作效率提高十倍以上；两次集体调解成立的九件，占所调解的十二件的百分之七十五，而六月份调解成立的三十五件，还不到所调解的八十四件的百分之五十。
