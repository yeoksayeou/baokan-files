Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 8th: Reports from various sources: The World Youth Festival is about to open on the 14th, and young people from all countries are actively preparing to participate. The Soviet Union is sending a large number of professional and amateur artists to participate in the delegation. These include the Stalin Automobile Factory Youth Choir, the Moscow Youth Song and Dance Ensemble, the Soviet Army Song and Dance Ensemble, the Russian Folk Orchestra of the Moscow Vocational School, as well as outstanding young singers, violinists, and actors from the opera houses and theaters of various republics.

France already has about one thousand young men and women preparing to participate in the Youth Festival, but fundraising is still continuing in urban and rural areas across the country in order to send more people. "L'Humanité" published an essay by a member of the delegation stating: "This is a festival for young people striving for peace. Young people declare: they do not want to die, they refuse to fight for foreign interests, and they will never fight against the great friend of all the world's people, the Soviet Union! Together with the democratic youth of the world, we will tear the Atlantic Pact—the pact of death—to pieces! The world will be ours!" French men and women are preparing gifts for democratic youth from all countries. The citizens of Alès in the Gard department, in order to thank the Czech people for receiving the families of French miners who were killed during the strike, are preparing special gifts for Czech youth. Now in Budapest, the great Chilean poet Neruda, in his open letter to the youth of the world, announced: Many youth delegations from our American homeland will come to Hungary to unite with the youth of the world in war and song, to defend peace, to defend their lives, and to defend the world that belongs to youth.

The British delegation, composed of seven hundred people, will depart on the 9th. At a farewell meeting in London, progressive Member of Parliament Zilliacus addressed the young delegates, calling on the youth of the world to unite to defend peace.

The Austrian democratic youth will be represented at the Youth Festival by a delegation composed of one thousand two hundred young men and women. Many young socialists, disregarding the prohibition of the Socialist Party leadership, still joined the delegation and will attend the World Youth Congress.

Forty percent of the delegates in the Czechoslovak delegation will be labor model workers.
