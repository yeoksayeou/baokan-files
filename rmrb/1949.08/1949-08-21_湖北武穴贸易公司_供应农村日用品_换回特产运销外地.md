　　Hubei Wuxue Trading Company
　　Supplies Daily Necessities to Rural Areas
　　in Exchange for Local Products for Sale Elsewhere
　　[Hubei News] The Guangji Wuxue Town Trading Company and the Guangji County Branch of the People's Bank of China began operations on July 20th. The Wuxue Trading Company is supplying the market with large quantities of salt, flour, soybeans, wheat, etc. As a large number of local products, such as hemp, tobacco leaves, and cotton, in the rural areas near Wuxue are滞留 stagnating in the countryside and difficult to sell elsewhere, and because of the impact of floods, some rural areas are unable to produce, the company has decided to organize unemployed workers and poor urban residents to transport daily necessities, such as flour and salt, to the rural areas with special products, in exchange for some of the special products for sale elsewhere. The prices of special products will be appropriately increased, and those participating in the transportation and sales will receive remuneration to support one to three people. The exchanged cotton will then be lent to farmers in disaster areas to spin yarn and weave cloth, enabling them to engage in production for self-help. The current main task of the Guangji County Bank is to combine the movement to ban silver dollars and copper coins, and redeem silver dollars and copper coins. The credit of the Renminbi has increased in the market, and merchants and vendors are reflecting that business is more active than in the past after the ban on silver dollars and copper coins. The bank is now actively investigating and studying the situation to support and develop industry and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

　　湖北武穴贸易公司
  　供应农村日用品
  　换回特产运销外地
    【湖北讯】广济武穴镇贸易公司和中国人民银行广济县分行，于七月二十号开始营业，武穴贸易公司正以大批食盐、面粉、黄豆、小麦等供应市场；由于武穴附近农村大批特产如麻、烟叶、棉花等，停滞在农村难于外销和因水灾影响，有些农村无力生产，该公司确定把日用必需品如面粉、食盐等，组织市内失业工人，贫苦市民，运往特产区农村，换取一部外销特产，适当提高特产价格，参加运销的人可得到维持一人至三人生活的报酬。然后将换得的棉花贷与灾区农户纺线织布，使能生产自救。广济县银行目前主要工作是结合禁用银元铜板运动，收兑银元铜板。市面上人民币信用提高，商人和小贩都反映：禁用银元铜板后，生意比过去更活动了。该行现正积极调查研究情况，扶植发展有利国计民生的工商业。
