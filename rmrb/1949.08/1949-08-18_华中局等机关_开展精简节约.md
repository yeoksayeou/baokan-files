Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 17th. The Central China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and other organs have launched a streamlining and economizing campaign. Regarding streamlining personnel: The Central China Bureau, the Central China Youth Committee, the United Front Work Department of the Central China Bureau, the Social Department of the Central China Bureau, the Central China Democratic Women's Federation, and the Central China Federation of Trade Unions have decided to streamline a total of 635 cadres, odd-job personnel, and soldiers. The streamlined personnel will be used to strengthen local work and the front-line troops. The Central China Bureau stipulates that all cadres except those above the level of deputy minister of the bureau shall have their bodyguards removed. In terms of saving on consumption, various organs have discovered many serious cases of waste during inspections. For example, in a certain unit of the Central China Bureau, the water pipes on the third floor were not properly managed, and 415,000 gallons of water were lost in three and a half days. The Xinhua News Agency's Central China Branch spent 1.04 million yuan on water and electricity in July, accounting for half of the branch's recurring expenses. Now, various organs have formulated specific measures for saving. Saving on water and electricity: All organs have stipulated a system for turning off lights on time. The Central China Bureau, the Social Department, the United Front Department, and the Youth Committee alone have reduced the number of electric lights by 143, and by replacing some large bulbs with small bulbs, the total reduction in lighting amounts to 8,356 degrees. The Central China Bureau and the Social Department have dug seven wells to reduce expenses on tap water. The Social Department alone has closed 34 faucets. Saving on food: All organs have implemented a system of collective meals and strictly controlling the number of diners. Budget review system has also been strictly enforced for office miscellaneous expenses.

　　华中局等机关
  　开展精简节约
    【新华社汉口十七日电】中共中央华中局等机关已展开精简节约运动。在精简人员方面：华中局、华中青委、华中局统一战线工作部、华中局社会部、华中民主妇联会、华中总工会等六个机关已决定精简干部、勤杂人员、战士共六百三五人。精简的人员用以加强地方工作和前方部队。华中局规定除该局正副部长以上的干部外，一律取消警卫员。在节约消费方面，各机关在检查浪费中，发现不少严重的浪费现象，例如华中局某单位三楼水管未管制好，三天半即漏耗水四万十五千加仑。新华社华中总分社七月份水电开支达一百零四万元，占该社经常费的一半。现各机关已订出具体的节约办法。水电节约：各机关都规定了按时息灯的制度，仅华中局、社会部、统战部、青委四个单位即减去电灯一百四十三盏，连一部分大灯泡换小灯泡，共减少灯光达八千三百五十六度。华中局和社会部已掘井七眼，以减少自来水费之开支。仅社会部即已闭塞了三十四个水龙头。伙食节约：各机关都实行集体吃饭与严格掌握吃饭人数等制度。办公杂支也严格执行了预算审查制度。
