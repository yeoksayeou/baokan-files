Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, August 26th: Polish News Agency, Warsaw, August 24th: The Polish Workers' Party sent a telegram congratulating the American Communist Party on its thirtieth anniversary. The text of the telegram is as follows: On this day of the thirtieth anniversary of the American Communist Party, we fervently hope for further success for the American Communist Party—the brave and staunch defender of the interests of the American working people. The American Communist Party has consistently striven to unite all workers—regardless of race, nationality, or belief—under the banner of democracy and peace, inheriting the noble traditions of democracy and freedom of the American people. The American Communist Party's struggle for international understanding and cooperation, and against reactionary militarism and imperialism, is an important link in the struggle waged by the world camp of peace and progress. Merely because they ruthlessly defend the rights and peace of the American people, twelve Communist leaders have been subjected to a shameful "trial," which will only strengthen the American people's will to oppose the conspiracies of the imperialist warmongers. We are deeply convinced that the American Communist Party will gloriously fulfill its lofty patriotic and internationalist tasks, and raise even higher the banner of struggle for people's rights, for freedom, democracy, and peace. The congratulatory telegram was signed by Zambrowski, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish Workers' Party.

　　美国共产党三十周年纪念
  　波兰工人党贺电
    【新华社北平二十六日电】波兰通讯社华沙二十四日讯：波兰工人党电贺美共三十周年纪念，电文如下：在这美国共产党三十周年纪念的日子，我们热切希望美国共产党——美国劳动人民利益底勇敢坚毅的捍卫者的进一步成功。美国共产党始终一贯地为团结全体工人——不分种族、民族和信仰——在民主、和平的旗帜下而奋斗，它继承了美国人民民主与自由的高尚传统。美国共产党争取国际间谅解与合作，反对反动军国主义与帝国主义的斗争，是世界和平与进步阵营所进行的斗争中一个重要环节。仅仅因为他们无情地保卫美国人民的权利与和平，十二位共产党领袖就遭到可耻的“审讯”，这只会加强美国人民反对帝国主义战争贩子阴谋的意志。我们深信，美国共产党必将光荣地完成它崇高的爱国的与国际主义的任务，更加高举为人民权利，为自由、民主与和平而斗争的旗帜。贺电是由波兰工人党中央委员会书记萨姆布劳斯基签字。
