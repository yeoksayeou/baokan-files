　　One Jin of Stinktree Seeds Yields Four Liang of Oil
　　Huang Shu
　　The stinktree, also known as the ailanthus or tree-of-heaven, is widely distributed in the warm mountains and plains of North China. It grows quickly when young, with a straight trunk. When the mother tree bears fruit, it is covered in red, which is very beautiful. Farmers in western Hebei call it the "king of trees." The wood is lustrous and flexible, making it ideal for windows, doors, and wooden rice hullers. It is also a good raw material for papermaking. The root bark is used in medicine, the leaves can be used to raise ailanthus silkworms, and the seeds can be pressed for oil for lamps and cooking. The oilseed cake can be used as fertilizer, and it also helps to prevent cutworm pests such as mole crickets and grubs.

　　It is worth mentioning the extraction of oil from ailanthus seeds. This handicraft is relatively common in counties along the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway, such as Pingding and Jingxing. There are five oil mills in Niangziguan Town, Pingding, which produce more than 10,000 jin of ailanthus seed oil each year. Many farmers in the vicinity use ailanthus seed oil extraction as a household sideline production. Every year between the Beginning of Autumn and the Autumn Equinox, farmers collect ripe ailanthus seeds, dry them in the field, remove small branches and fruit stalks, and then crush the fruit wings in a vat with their feet. Then they fan away the debris, leaving only the flat, round kernels in the middle. At this point, they are placed on a millstone and pressed, adding more as they go. When the millstone is full and everything is crushed, about two market liters of cold water are poured onto every 100 jin of seeds. After grinding for a while, when a large amount of oil is seen to emerge, it can be loaded into an iron ring and pressed on a beam. About 150 jin of pure seeds can be pressed at a time. The method is simple and does not require steaming or boiling, which saves labor compared to extracting castor oil.

　　The best time to extract ailanthus seed oil is from the Sanfu (the hottest period of summer) to the end of autumn. At this time, the weather is warm and more oil is produced. Each jin of pure seeds can yield four liang of oil (25 percent). The price of oil in Pingding is similar to that of castor oil, but slightly more expensive than sesame oil, and each jin can be exchanged for four to five jin of millet. There is also oilseed cake that can be used as fertilizer, which is really quite profitable. Ailanthus seed oil has three characteristics: (1) the oil has a bitter taste that prevents spoilage, and it does not go bad for two or three years; (2) it is durable and bright for lighting lamps, and does not freeze in winter; (3) when stir-frying, put the oil in a hot pan first, add radish slices or scallions and garlic and fry. After a while, the bitter taste can be removed, and it will not upset the stomach, unlike eating castor oil, which has a bad effect on the stomach.

　　There are many ailanthus trees in various parts of North China, such as in Jianping, Pingshan, and even Gaocheng counties in western Hebei. Every year, a village can collect hundreds or even thousands of jin of ailanthus seeds, but there are not many places that know how to use ailanthus seeds to extract oil. Now that the ailanthus seeds are about to ripen, oil mills in various places, especially those run by cooperatives, should use this natural by-product to collect ailanthus seeds and experiment with oil extraction. After success, they should organize the villagers to collect a large amount of seeds and exchange them for oil. The widespread development of this sideline industry will enable North China to increase its annual production of vegetable oil and oilseed cake by hundreds of thousands or even millions of jin.

　　At the same time, the ailanthus is also an extremely drought-resistant tree that can grow on loess slopes and barren hillsides. Using ailanthus seeds to carry out afforestation by sowing on barren mountains is very easy to succeed. In the mountainous areas of western Hebei, the masses can be mobilized to collect a large number of ailanthus seeds in preparation for sowing and afforestation after autumn and next year. This will play a significant role in greening barren mountains and eliminating flood and drought disasters.

### 一斤椿籽四两油

　　一斤椿籽四两油
    黄舒
    臭椿也叫樗树，或叫椿树，普遍分布于华北温暖的山地和平原，幼时生长很快，树干挺直，母树结果时，满树通红，非常美观，冀西农民称为树王。木材富有光彩和屈挠性，用来做窗户门扇和木砻最合适，又是造纸的好原料。根皮入药，树叶可以养椿蚕，树籽还可以打油，供点灯和食用，油饼用来肥田，兼有防治蝼蛄、蛴螬等切根害虫的效用。
    值得特别介绍的，是用椿籽打油。这种手工业在石太铁路沿线上的平定、井陉等县比较普遍。平定娘子关镇有五家油房，每年要打椿籽油一万斤以上。附近农民利用椿籽打油，作为家庭副业生产的很多。每年立秋至秋分之间，农民采集成熟的椿籽，在场中晒干，打掉小枝和果柄，然后放缸中用脚踩碎果翅，再扇掉杂物，光剩下当中扁圆的仁。这时便放在碾上压，随压随添，至碾盘已满，全部将压烂时，每百斤籽泼上凉水两市升左右，再碾一会，至见油大量冒出时，便可装入铁圈中上梁压榨，约有纯籽一百五十斤左右，便可打一回。方法简单，不用蒸煮，比打大麻子油（篦麻油）省工。
    打椿籽油最好在三伏至秋末，这时天气暖和，出油较多，每斤纯籽能出油四两（合百分之二十五）。油价在平定和大麻油相近，而比小麻油稍贵，每斤能换小米四至五斤。还有油饼可做肥料，获利实在不小。椿籽油有三个特点：（一）油有苦味能防腐，放两三年不变坏；（二）点灯耐用且明亮，冬天不冻结；（三）炒菜时先把油放红热的锅中，加萝卜片或葱蒜煎，一会便可去掉苦味，吃了不坏肚，不象吃大麻油那样对肠胃有不好反应。
    华北各地椿树不少，如冀西建屏平山以至藁城各县很多村子，每年一村可采集椿籽数百斤以至数千斤，但晓得利用椿籽打油的地方还不多。现在椿籽快要成熟了，各地油房，特别是合作社办的油房，应利用这一天然副产物可采集椿籽试验打油。成功以后，即组织老乡大量采籽，拿籽换油。这个副业普遍发展起来，将使全华北每年增产数十万斤以至数百万斤的植物油和油饼。
    同时，臭椿又是一种极耐旱的树，在黄土坡和瘠薄的山坡上都能生长，利用椿籽进行荒山播种造林，很易成功。冀西山地，可发动群众大量采集椿籽，以备秋后及明年进行播种造林，对绿化荒山，消除水旱灾害作用不小。
