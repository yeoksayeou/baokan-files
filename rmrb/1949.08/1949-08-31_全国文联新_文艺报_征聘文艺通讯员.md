　　The National Federation of Literary and Art Circles New "Literary Gazette" Recruits Literary Correspondents

　　[This Dispatch] To strengthen connections, promptly understand situations, exchange experiences, study problems, launch literary criticism, and promote the literary and artistic movement, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles has decided to publish a new "Literary Gazette" (semi-monthly). To enable the "Literary Gazette" to closely connect with the masses, the editorial board of the newspaper plans to widely recruit literary correspondents to organize a nationwide literary correspondence network, and stipulates the following measures: 1. Any comrade in a literary and artistic work post, or comrades working in factories, rural areas, or the military who care about the literary and artistic movement, who can continuously contribute correspondence more than twice, regardless of whether it is adopted, can be regarded as a literary correspondent of the newspaper after being approved by the editorial board of the newspaper. 2. The task of the literary correspondent is to frequently contact the newspaper, promptly report the situation of literary and artistic work in the area or organization, provide experiences and problems found in the work, and the opinions of the masses on literary and artistic works or literary and artistic work. 3. Literary correspondents enjoy the following rights: They will receive a copy of the Literary Gazette every issue; when the newspaper publishes series of books or other publications, they will enjoy preferential discounts; if correspondents have any questions on literary or other issues, the newspaper will assist in answering them. It is reported that the newspaper has issued notices to relevant organizations, requesting comrades from all aspects who care about literary and artistic work to assist and actively participate in this work.
