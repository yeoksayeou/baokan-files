    Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Summer Study Session
    Summarizes Learning and Prepares for Conclusion
    [Our Newspaper] The primary and secondary school teachers' summer study session, after a month of study, has decided to conclude on the 15th of this month. Through this study, most of the students have gained new understanding of labor viewpoints, class viewpoints, and the problems of the Chinese revolution. Although a few people have a relatively vague understanding, they have also begun to recognize the errors of the old viewpoints. In order to clarify the gains of the students in the past month, point out the direction of continued efforts, and help the leadership to summarize, the General Association decided to conduct individual summaries from the 11th to the 13th. The content is the ideological changes in the past three months, whether the learning attitude is modest, realistic, and mutually helpful, and whether the learning spirit is active and hardworking, mastering criticism and self-criticism, etc. On the 10th, each group discussed the significance of the summary, the method and steps of the summary, and began to carry out this work. On the 14th, all the students will hold a get-together in Zhongshan Park, with the music education research group and each branch preparing programs separately.

    中小学教职员暑期学习会
    总结学习准备结业
    【本报讯】中小学教职员暑期学习会，经一月学习，决定于本月十五日结束。经过这次学习，大多数学员在劳动观点、阶级观点以及中国革命问题上，均有了新的认识，少数人虽然认识较模糊，但也开始认识到旧观点的错误。总会为了明确一月来学员的收获，指出继续努力的方向，帮助领导上做总结，决定从十一号起至十三号做个人总结，内容是三月来在思想方面的转变，学习态度是否虚心，实是求是，互助友爱等，及学习精神是否积极努力，掌握批评与自我批评等。十号各小组均讨论了总结的意义，总结的方式与步骤，并着手进行这一工作。十四号全体学员将在中山公园举行同乐会，由该会音教研及各分会分别准备节目。
