    Congress Declaration
    [Ping City News] The Beiping Municipal People's Representatives Conference closed yesterday (the 14th). Before the closing, the representatives unanimously passed the Congress Declaration. The full text is as follows:

  Declaration of the Beiping Municipal People's Representatives Conference
    Dear compatriots of all circles in Beiping!
    Our Beiping Municipal People's Representatives Conference has successfully concluded today. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the conference accepted with unparalleled enthusiasm the wise instructions of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Vice Chairman Zhou, and unanimously listened with satisfaction to the work reports of the Military Control Commission and the People's Government in the half-year since the liberation of Beiping. We conducted heated discussions, passed clear and easily implementable resolutions, and successfully completed the tasks of the conference.
    This conference was a success. It was filled with the new spirit and style of people's democracy, which is completely different from the outdated and hypocritical democracy of capitalist countries. We deeply experienced the Chinese Communist Party's boundless loyalty to the people's cause and the spirit of unity among the people, namely, the four class friends of the working class, the peasantry, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie. We spoke our minds freely and exhaustively, like a family. We handled all proposals entirely based on the conditions of necessity and possibility. Those that should be done and could be done were done; those that should be done but could not yet be done were postponed; those that should not be done and could not be done were rejected. Right was right, wrong was wrong; deliberations led to decisions, and decisions were implemented. Different opinions were debated, and criticism and self-criticism were conducted, achieving unity through necessary debate. This is unity on a truly democratic basis. We personally experienced that this kind of democratic life is the most real and richest.
    With the real democracy within our people, we can and must resolutely implement dictatorship over the enemy. Our current enemies are imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries, who are their concentrated expression. They are still unwilling to accept defeat and extinction. In Beiping, these counter-revolutionaries are still trying every means and using the most shameless conspiracies to sabotage us. We demand that the People's Government thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionary activities and implement a policy combining leniency and suppression. We must resolutely and severely punish the ringleaders of the counter-revolution and those who stubbornly refuse to repent. We call on compatriots from all walks of life to raise their vigilance, distinguish between friends and enemies, practice democracy within the people, and jointly exercise dictatorship over counter-revolutionaries, in order to consolidate the people's democratic system, defend the people's own vital interests and the property of the motherland, consolidate the rear, engage in various construction projects in New Beiping, and support the front with manpower, material resources, and financial resources to carry the revolution through to the end.
    We have reviewed the various construction works in Beiping over the past half year and believe that there have been great achievements. Many things that the reactionary ruling class of the past could not achieve for a long time have been done well in the half-year that the people themselves have been in power, which proves the greatness of the people's power. In the future, further continuing to restore and develop Beiping's production is still the central link in all our construction work. At present, the production of public and private enterprises in Beiping has largely recovered, and some have achieved new development. Although some production that is not beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood has declined or been eliminated, this is also a good phenomenon in the process of progress. Facts have proven that all those that are needed by the people, have a source of raw materials, and are well managed have a promising future, otherwise they will inevitably be eliminated. Therefore, we call on all public and private enterprises to restore, transform, and develop their own production according to the needs of the people's lives, strive to improve management, improve technology, reduce costs, improve quality, and make products meet the specifications required by the people. Public and private sectors should jointly further develop urban and rural trade and widely open up sales channels. In state-owned enterprises, democratic management must be further implemented; in private enterprises, labor-capital disputes must be further systematically resolved, and the enthusiasm and creativity of all employees must be improved. At the same time, we must severely punish unscrupulous merchants for hoarding and speculation, so that wartime financial and price fluctuations will not have unexpected and drastic fluctuations, and absorb idle funds into legitimate production. We believe that as long as we correctly implement the policy of taking into consideration both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, assisting each other between urban and rural areas, and exchanging inside and outside, improve management and administrative methods, we will certainly be able to overcome all the difficulties of the transition period, transform Beiping from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal economy to a completely independent and autonomous economy, and gradually transform Beiping, a consuming city, into a producing city step by step.
    Today, we are faced with the dual tasks of supporting the great national liberation war and building a new Beiping. This requires us to not only continue to work hard to restore and develop production, but also to promote streamlining and thrift, oppose waste, and appropriately evacuate the city's unemployed population. All agencies and departments should formulate practical measures for streamlining and thrift, mobilize the city's surplus labor force and intellectuals to go to the countryside, reduce the city's unemployed population, and assist in the development of rural production and cultural construction. All landlords who have fled can return to their hometowns to participate in production. Except for those who are guilty of heinous crimes and continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, we will not pursue their past deeds. We deeply hope that all citizens will work together to eliminate the bad habits left over from the old society, regard hard work and production as the supreme glory, and regard parasitism and waste as the greatest shame. Our culture and education must pay close attention to cultivating a large number of useful talents in accordance with the needs of production and construction in the new China, so as to supply the cadres necessary for various construction undertakings.
    Dear compatriots from all walks of life! Today, the face of this ancient city of Beiping has been completely renewed, but we must not be complacent about this. We must further overcome difficulties in order to build the people's capital. All our democratic classes, parties, and groups should learn from each other, help each other, unite closely, mobilize all forces, and develop various construction undertakings in New Beiping.

    大会宣言
    【平市讯】北平市各界代表会议于昨（十四）日闭幕，闭幕前，代表全体一致通过大会宣言，全文如下：
  北平市各界代表会议宣言
    亲爱的北平各界同胞们！
    我们北平各界代表会议于今日圆满闭幕。大会在中国共产党的领导下，以无比的热情接受了毛主席、朱总司令、周副主席的英明指示，并一致满意地听取了军事管制委员会和人民政府在北平解放后半年来的工作报告，进行了热烈的讨论，并通过了明确易行的决议，胜利地完成了会议的任务。
    这次会议是成功的。它充满了新的人民民主的精神与作风，这和资本主义国家陈旧的虚伪的民主迥然不同。我们深刻体验到中国共产党对人民事业的无限忠诚和在人民内部，即在工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级这四个阶级朋友间的团结精神，知无不言，言无不尽，象一家人一样。我们处理一切提案，完全根据需要与可能的条件，凡应办而可办者即办；凡应办尚无力办者则暂缓办；不应办亦不能办者则予以否决。是则是，非则非；议必决，决必行。有不同的意见则展开争论，进行批评与自我批评，以必要的争辩而达到团结一致。这是在真正民主基础上的团结。我们亲身体验到这样的民主生活是最真实最丰富的了。
    有了我们人民内部的真正的民主，我们就能够而且必须坚决实行对敌人的专政。我们当前的敌人是帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义及其集中表现的国民党反动派的残余势力。它们还不甘心失败与灭亡。在北平，这些反革命分子仍然千方百计，用最无耻的阴谋活动来破坏我们，我们要求人民政府彻底肃清一切反革命分子的活动，执行宽大与镇压相结合的政策，对于反革命的首恶分子与怙恶不悛的分子，坚决予以严惩。我们号召各界同胞，提高警惕，分清敌友，在人民内部实行民主，共同对反革命分子实行专政，以便巩固人民民主制度，保卫人民自己切身的利益和祖国的财产，巩固后方，从事新北平的各项建设，并以人力物力财力，支援前线，把革命进行到底。
    我们检讨了北平半年来的各项建设工作，认为有很大成绩。有许多历来反动统治阶级长期不能做到的事情，在人民自己当政的半年间举办得很好，这证明了人民力量的伟大。今后进一步继续恢复与发展北平的生产仍是我们一切建设工作的中心环节。目前北平的公私企业生产已大体恢复，有些已得到新的发展，虽然也有些无益于国计民生的生产下降或被淘汰，但这也是进步过程中的好现象。事实证明，凡人民所需要的原料有来源的而且经营得法的都有发展前途，否则就必然会被淘汰。因此我们号召一切公私企业，按照人民生活的需要来恢复改造并发展自己的生产，努力改善经营，改良技术，减低成本，提高质量并使生产品合乎人民需要的规格，公私合力进一步开展城乡贸易，广泛开辟销路。在公营企业中必须进一步实行管理民主化；在私营企业中必须进一步系统地解决劳资纠纷，提高全体职工的积极性与创造性。同时必须严厉制裁奸商的囤积居奇和投机倒把，使战时的金融物价不至再有意外的剧烈波动，吸收游资到正当的生产中去。我们相信只要我们正确执行公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流的四面八方的政策，改善经营与管理的方法，我们就一定能够克服过渡时期的一切困难，使北平从过去半殖民地半封建的经济改变为完全独立自主的经济，使北平这个消费的城市一步一步地逐渐变为生产的城市。
    今天摆在我们面前的是支援伟大的全国解放战争和建设新北平的双重任务。这就要求我们除了继续努力恢复与发展生产之外，还要提倡精简节约，反对浪费，并适当疏散城市的无业人口。各机关、各部门应规定切实的精简节约办法，动员城市过剩的劳动力和知识分子到乡村去，减少城市失业人口，并协助发展乡村的生产和文化建设。所有逃亡的地主，均可回乡参加生产，除罪大恶极和继续进行反革命活动者外，即可不究既往，我们深望全体市民一致努力扫除旧社会遗留的不良风气，要以勤劳生产为无上光荣，而以寄生浪费为莫大耻辱。我们的文化教育，必须切实注意按照新中国生产建设的需要，来培养大批有用的人材，以便供给各种建设事业所必需的干部。
    亲爱的各界同胞们！今天北平这一个古城的面目已经焕然一新了，但是，我们决不能以此自满，我们还必须进一步克服困难才能建设人民的首都，我们各个民主的阶级、党派、团体，应互相学习，互相帮助，亲密团结，动员一切力量，发展新北平的各项建设事业。
