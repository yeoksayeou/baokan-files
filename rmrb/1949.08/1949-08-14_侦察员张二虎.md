    Scout Zhang Erhu

    I

    Zhang Erhu, was a well-known "clown." Nobody knew where he learned his set of skills, but no one could outdo him in making a fool of himself. He could imitate the sounds of chickens, cats, and even the grunts of a sow. He couldn't speak three sentences without throwing in a witty remark, and once he opened his mouth, it was like a gramophone, playing one record after another. Even the way he walked, spat, and blew his nose had a comical air about it, making people laugh. During games, he was always the center of attention, and without him, people couldn't laugh and joke to their heart's content. Other comrades seemed to envy him for this, and he himself was quite proud of it. But when it came to serious matters, he changed: he didn't like to study, was sloppy, and loved to make strange remarks. He often said, "A scout is like a 'commander without soldiers,' always wandering around under the noses of the enemy with his head tucked into his belt. What's the point of studying!" When military democracy was being promoted, others spoke actively and enthusiastically, but when asked, he would say, "Major matters are for Chairman Mao, minor matters are for the platoon leader, why should I worry about it!" Because he loved to tell jokes to everyone, the villagers in this area were all very familiar with him. As soon as he walked into the village entrance with his rifle on his back, the children would shout and surround him from afar, touching his belt, patting his backpack, and clamoring, "Can the 'clown' imitate a cat?" One day, he came to a village office, didn't say a word, and buried himself in the kang to sleep, leaving the villagers completely baffled. Nobody knew what kind of "dumpling" he was "making."

    Indeed, these days Zhang Erhu wasn't "clowning" around much. He was completely tormented by another kind of emotion. Although he was lying on the kang, pretending to sleep, his mind was racing.

    Since the higher-ups launched the merit campaign in Red May, the comrades had all been striving to become heroes. When a battle started, they charged forward like little tigers, driving the "gangs" (i.e., the landlord's returning home defense corps) to hide in their "turtle shells" all day long, afraid to come out. The work in the "no-man's land" was recovering day by day. Many comrades had performed meritorious service for the people during this period and become glorious heroes. Wasn't Wang Jianguo, a fellow scout, the one who continued fighting without stepping down the line even after being wounded three times in a battle, and finally charged up and captured an enemy "big flower pole" machine gun, earning a special commendation? Didn't the new soldier Wang Wenyuan chase the enemy robbing wheat for three miles in the battle to defend the wheat harvest, capturing two rifles and a submachine gun, also earning a major commendation? Even in the Yongning battle, that little newly liberated soldier earned a commendation for charging ahead and fearlessly pursuing the enemy, didn't he? He himself had joined the army when fighting the Japanese devils and had been in the army for five or six years, but he wasn't even as good as the new soldiers and liberated soldiers, without any merit at all. What the hell could he say about that! The more he thought about it, the more angry he became with himself. Although he had thought: If you perform meritorious service, it's still twenty-four liang of millet a day, and if I don't perform meritorious service, I still get every grain... but he always felt that being a hero was glorious after all. He had completely seen and felt people's respect and admiration for heroes during these times, which was so different from their envy of his "clowning." "What kind of skill is that!?" He began to get angry with himself! The internal struggle became more and more intense.

    III

    It was raining lightly, the fog was thick, and people couldn't be seen from a few dozen meters away. Zhang Erhu was carrying his "American-made" rifle, staggering as he walked towards the railway.

    Yesterday, the higher-ups issued instructions saying: The enemy had reinforced troops in Huairou City and was going to launch a destructive "mopping-up" operation against our Pingbei base area. The situation was very tense. The scouts had all gone out to perform missions, leaving only Zhang Erhu at home. The battalion commander personally went to him and told him about the reconnaissance mission: "Investigate in detail the enemy's unit designations, personnel, arms, equipment, combat effectiveness, deployment, etc." He repeatedly explained the importance of this reconnaissance for crushing the enemy's "mopping-up" conspiracy. Finally, the battalion commander said to him with a smile, "Zhang Erhu, since our unit launched the merit campaign, you haven't performed any major or minor merits. If you can complete this mission well, I guarantee you'll get a major commendation!"

    Zhang Erhu walked along, pondering the words the battalion commander told him. "Guarantee you'll get a major commendation" appeared in his mind like a movie, over and over again, so much so that he didn't even feel the raindrops falling on him.

    He walked a short distance and then plunged into the crops, advancing skillfully and stealthily based on his experience as a scout over the past few years. After crawling out of the last section of sorghum field, he reached the highway. The pillbox was right on top of his head, and he couldn't go any further. So he lay in the ditch on the side of the road, thinking, "I'll grab a 'live confession' (i.e., a prisoner) and ask in detail." Suddenly, a loud whooshing sound came from afar. He looked sharply at the sky, but there was nothing in the vast expanse of white. But when he quickly turned his head back, an American military vehicle with a green canvas top was right in front of him. This made him very anxious: if he lay still, the car might not notice him and drive past; if he stood up and ran into the sorghum field, it wasn't like he couldn't run; but neither of these were things that a People's Liberation Army soldier could do; if he opened fire, he wouldn't be afraid of one car, but since he was so close to the pillbox, if a battle started, he would be alone after all, and if more enemies came... Time didn't allow him to continue thinking. The car had already reached the top of his head, so he didn't hesitate to sling his rifle across his back, put the hand grenade ring on his right middle finger, and with a "whoosh!" he pounced on the car. Due to excessive force, he crashed into the driver's arms, but he immediately half-stood up and, holding up the grenade, shouted loudly, "Nobody move! Stop the car quickly, whoever dares to move, I'll blow them to pieces!" The four people in the car were stunned by his rapid movements, and each of them stared blankly at him! Especially the woman who was dressed like a pug, her face was ashen. The car stopped, and Zhang Erhu confiscated the orderly's Mauser pistol and took the American pistol from the guy with the shoulder boards. At this point, they seemed to have just woken up and kept yelling, "Master, spare our lives!" Zhang Erhu didn't bother to explain the prisoner policy to them in detail, but simply ordered, "Quickly carry your things and follow me, I won't kill you." So the four prisoners—the enemy regimental headquarters adjutant, the regimental commander's concubine, the orderly, and the driver—obediently got out of the car. At this time, although the machine guns in the pillbox were firing wildly, our brave scout nonchalantly swaggered back with the prisoners. Because he knew very well that at this time the enemy would only use bullets to vent their anger and would not dare to step down from the pillbox.

    From the enemy adjutant's mouth, we learned what we needed to know, guaranteeing a victorious condition for crushing the enemy's "mopping-up" operation. Zhang Erhu truly performed a great service.

    侦察员张二虎
    一
    张二虎，是出了名的“活宝”，也不知道他都是从那学来的那一套本领，出“洋相”谁也比不上。他不但会学鸡叫、猫叫，还会学老母猪哼哼。说不上三句话，就要带上个俏皮字眼，打开他那话匣子，真是象留声机似的，唱了一片又一片。就是连他走路，吐唾沫、擤鼻涕，也都带着那么一股子洋相劲，引人发笑。游戏的时候，那回他也是大家最留意的目标，甚至没有他在，人们就不能尽情的说笑。这一点，别的同志们似乎对他有些羡慕，他自己也很引为自豪。可是一提到正经的，他就变样了：不爱学习，吊儿郎当，还爱讲个小怪话，他常说：“侦察员就是‘没兵司令’，成天价脑袋掖在裤腰带上，在敌人眼皮子底下晃荡，你学习个裘！”开展军事民主，别人都积极踊跃的发言，问他，他却说：“大事有毛主席，小事有班长，还用得着我操这份心！”因为他见了谁也爱说个笑话，所以连这一带村庄的老乡们也都对他很熟悉。只要他背着大枪一走进村口，小孩子们就会老远的喊着围上来，这个摸摸他的皮带，那个通通他的背包，嚷嚷着：“叫‘活宝’学个猫叫好不好？”一天，他来到某村村公所，连一句话也不说，就一头扎到炕头上睡起闷觉，这可把老乡们弄了个莫明其妙，“接三的饺子”谁也不知道是啥馅包的。
    二
    的确，这几天张二虎出“洋相”的时候不多了，他完全为另外一种情绪所苦恼着；这会别看他躺地炕上睡闷觉，心里可正七上八下的想事呢！
    自从红五月上级号召开展立功运动以来，同志们每人都蹩着那么一股子劲当功臣，一打起仗来，个个都是小老虎似的往前冲，把“伙会”（即地主还乡团）打的整天钻在“王八窝”里不敢出来一步，“无人区”的工作一天天在恢复着。有好多同志都在这期间为人民立了功，当上光荣功臣了。和他一块的侦察员王建国，不就是在一次战斗中，连挂三次花不下火线，最后又冲上去缴了敌人一挺“大花杆”机枪，立了一次特功吗？新战士王文元在保卫麦收战斗中，一气把抢麦敌人追出去三里地，缴了两支大枪、一挺冲锋式，也立了大功吗？就是在永宁战斗中，刚解放过来的那个小个子解放战士，人家不也因为冲锋在前，奋不顾身的追杀敌人而立了功吗？自己在打日本鬼子时就参加了部队，到现在也五六年了，却连人家新战士、解放战士也不如，一点功没立，这真是他妈的从那说起！他想着想着就对自己有些气恨起来。虽然他也曾想到过：你立了功也是一天二十四两小米，我不立功也一个粒不少……但是又老觉着毕竟还是当个功臣光荣。他这些时完全看见和体会到了人们对功臣的敬仰钦佩，和对于他的出“洋相”的羡慕，竟是那样的不同。“你这算那号本事！？”他开始对自己愤怒了！内心斗争一次比一次更加激烈起来。
    三
    天下着小雨，雾气昭昭，离几十米达远就看不见人。张二虎提着他那支“美国造”的，一步一歪的朝铁路边走来。
    昨天上级来指示说：怀柔城敌人增了兵，要对我平北根据地进行毁灭性的“扫荡。”情况很紧张，侦察员们都出去执行任务去了，家里就剩下张二虎自己。大队长亲自找他去，告诉他这次的侦察任务：“详细侦察敌军番号、兵员、兵种、武器配备、战斗力、部署等。”并再三说明这次侦察，对粉碎敌人“扫荡”阴谋的重要性。最后，大队长笑着向他说：“张二虎，自从咱们部队开展立功运动后，你可是大功小功都没立过呢，这回你要能很好的完成任务，保证给你记一大功！”
    张二虎一边走着，一边盘算着大队长告给他的那些话。“保证给你记一大功”竟象演电影似的三番五次的在他脑子里出现，以致雨点打在身上都不觉得。
    他走了一截路，就钻进了庄稼地，凭着他那几年来当侦察员的经验，很熟练、隐蔽的前进着。爬出最后一段高粱地，就到汽路上了，炮楼子顶在脑瓜顶上，再不能往前去。于是他便爬在汽路壕沟里盘算着：“弄个“活口供”（即俘虏）回去详细问一问。忽然，很响的呜呜的声音由远而近，他机警的朝天空望了下，白茫茫的一大片什么也没有，可是当他很快的回过头来的时候，一辆支着绿帆布顶子的美国军用汽车，就到他跟前了，这一下可把他急了个够受：爬着不动吧，汽车也许发现不了自己开过去；站起来钻高粱地吧，也并不是跑不了；但这却都不是一个解放军的战士所能干的；开枪打吧，一辆汽车固然不怕它，可是离炮楼这么近，打起仗来究竟自己是一个人，那会要是多来几个……时间已经不容许他再继续想下去，汽车已经开到头顶上来了，于是他毫不加思索的把大枪横着一背，手榴弹弦往右手中指上一套，“嗖！”的一下，就朝汽车扑上去。由于用力过猛，一下撞在了司机怀里，但他马上半站直了身子，高举着手榴弹大声命令着：“谁也不许动！赶快停车，谁敢动我炸死谁！”车上的四个人，都被他这种神速的动作吓呆了，一个个直挺挺的两只眼瞅着他发楞！尤其那个打扮得象个哈吧狗似的女人，脸上简直成了死人色。车停了，张二虎收缴了那个勤务兵的盒子枪，又从那个带着肩章的家伙身上解下那支美国橹子。这时，他们才好象刚醒过来，一个劲的叫着“老爷饶命！”张二虎顾不上再给他们详细讲俘虏政策，只简单的命令着：“赶快把东西扛上跟我走，不杀你们。”于是这四个俘虏——敌军团部的副官、团长姨太太、勤务兵、司机——便乖乖的走下了汽车。这时，虽然炮楼上疯狂的打起了机枪，但我英勇的侦察员却若无其事的大摇大摆地押着俘虏走回来。因为他深深知道，这时的敌人只会拿子弹出气，而不敢走下炮楼一步。
    从俘虏回来的敌副官嘴里，了解了我们所要了解的情况，保证了粉碎敌人“扫荡”的一个胜利条件。张二虎真真立了一大功。
