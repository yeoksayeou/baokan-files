Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 8th: Moscow dispatch: Millions of collective farmers and agricultural workers across the Soviet Union are carrying out the great project of transforming nature according to Stalin's plan. They are vigorously developing irrigation systems, building ponds and reservoirs, in order to turn millions of hectares of dry land, areas long plagued by drought, and even the waterless zone in Uzbekistan formerly known as the "Hunger Steppe," into fertile land.

The development of irrigation systems by collective farms and state farms is being carried out with the strong assistance of the Soviet government. The government not only provides long-term loans, but also bears all the costs of surveying, design and technical guidance. At the same time, construction work can make extensive use of the country's power stations, machinery and tractor stations, and land reclamation stations' bulldozers, excavators and transport vehicles.

According to Stalin's plan, more than 44,000 ponds and reservoirs will be built in the national steppe and forest-steppe zones from this year to 1955. Last year, a total of 2,812 reservoirs were built in southern Soviet Union, and this year it will increase to 4,300. In Ukraine, known as the "granary of Europe," 2,000 collective farms are building reservoirs. In some places, dozens of collective farms are jointly building a large reservoir. For example, a large reservoir being built in the Krasnodar Territory will be able to irrigate 30,000 hectares of land (equivalent to more than 480,000 Chinese acres). State farms will build a total of 215 reservoirs this year, three times as many as last year. The state is also vigorously building large-scale irrigation systems in Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan and other places. This construction work is one of the characteristics of the transition from socialism to communism. The irrigation system being built in the Ararat Depression in Armenia will be able to irrigate 200,000 hectares of land. The waterless zone in Uzbekistan, formerly known as the "Hunger Steppe," has now been irrigated with sufficient water.

    按照斯大林的计划改造自然
    苏大力发展灌溉系统
    乌兹贝克无水地带已变成丰饶沃土
    【新华社北平八日电】莫斯科讯：苏联全国千百万集体农民和农业工人，正按照斯大林的计划，进行改造自然的伟大工程。他们正大力发展灌溉系统、建筑池塘与蓄水池，以便把千百万公顷的旱地，久受旱灾的地区，甚至乌兹贝克的以前称为“饥饿草原”的无水地带，都变成丰饶的沃土。
    集体农场、国营农场发展灌溉系统的工作，是在苏联政府大力帮助下进行的。政府不仅发放长期贷款，而且还负担探测、设计与技术指导等的一切费用。同时，建筑工作还可广泛利用国家的电力站，机器与拖拉机站和造林站的开山机、挖土机和运输车辆。
    按照斯大林的计划，从今年到一九五五年，要在全国草原与森林草原地带，建筑四万四千多个池塘与蓄水池。去年，苏联南部共建筑了二千八百一十二个蓄水池，今年将增加到四千三百个。在称为“欧洲的谷仓”的乌克兰，正有两千个集体农场在建筑蓄水池。有些地方是几十个集体农场共同建筑一个大蓄水池，例如克拉斯诺达边疆区正在建筑的一个大蓄水池，就能灌溉三万公顷的土地（约合四十八万华亩以上）。国营农场今年共将建筑二百一十五个蓄水池，相当于去年的三倍。国家并在乌克兰、阿塞拜疆、乔治亚、哈萨克等地大力建设规模庞大的灌溉系统。这一建设工作，便是从社会主义到共产主义过渡时期的特点之一。阿美尼亚正在建设的阿那拉特洼地建筑的灌溉系统，将能灌溉二十万公顷土地。乌兹贝克的以前称为“饥饿”草原的无水地带，现在已经得到充足水量的灌溉。
