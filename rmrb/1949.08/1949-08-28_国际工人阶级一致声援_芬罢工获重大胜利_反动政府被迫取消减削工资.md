　　International Working Class Unanimously Supports
    Finnish Strike Wins Major Victory
  　Reactionary Government Forced to Cancel Wage Cuts
    【Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 27th】Helsinki dispatch: After nearly six weeks of heroic struggle, Finnish striking workers have won a major victory. The Finnish Council of State was forced to decide on the evening of the 22nd to instruct the factory owners of the Kemi Oy (Kemi Inc.) to cancel the wage cuts and restore the original wages before the strike. At the same time, the Lapland State Administrative Authority announced the abolition of the state of emergency in Kemi and removed the cordon from the workers' residences and the editorial department of Kansan Tahto newspaper. Democratic leaders Heittojaevi and Maki-ninen, a staff member of the Timber Workers' Union, who were illegally arrested, have been released.
    The heroic struggle of the striking workers has received support from the international working class and progressive public opinion. Major trade unions in Poland have sent letters and telegrams to the Finnish striking workers, guaranteeing the shared interests of the proletariat, protesting the crimes of the Finnish government, and condemning the tyrannical attitude of the right-wing elements of the Central Federation of Finnish Trade Unions. Swedish democrats criticized the Fagerholm government's terrorist actions against the Finnish working people, exposing it as part of the Anglo-American bloc's political measures, which seek to defeat the democratic forces in Finland and strengthen the aggressive North Atlantic Alliance.
    In the course of the strike, the true colors of the right-wing Social Democrats in betraying the interests of the workers became increasingly apparent. On the 23rd, a democratic newspaper published the original text of a secret letter from the parliamentary group of the Coalition Party (Conservative Party), completely exposing the conspiracy between the right-wing Social Democrats and the Coalition Party. The letter revealed that the Coalition Party members supported the right-wing Social Democratic Fagerholm government, believing that only a Social Democratic government or a government including the Social Democrats could successfully resist the struggle of the working masses to maintain their living standards, and they placed great hopes on the activities of the right-wing Social Democrats in the trade unions. The democratic newspaper emphasized that recent developments, especially the split in the Central Federation of Finnish Trade Unions, prove that all the right-wing Social Democratic leaders in the government and the trade union movement are basely executing the orders of the big capitalists of the Coalition Party.

### 国际工人阶级一致声援  芬罢工获重大胜利　反动政府被迫取消减削工资

　　国际工人阶级一致声援
    芬罢工获重大胜利
  　反动政府被迫取消减削工资
    【新华社北平二十七日电】赫尔辛基讯：经过近六星期的英勇斗争，芬兰罢工工人已获得重大胜利。芬兰国务会议被迫不得不于二十二日晚决定：责成开密股份公司厂主取消减削工资并恢复罢工前原有工资。同时，拉伯兰州行政当局宣布废除开密的紧急状态，从工人住宅和坎桑·塔托报编辑部撤除警戒线。被非法逮捕的民主领袖赫托雅维和木材工人职工会职员马基宁，已获释放。
    这次罢工工人的英勇斗争，得到了国际工人阶级和进步舆论的声援。波兰各主要职工会均曾致函电慰问芬兰罢工工人，保证无产阶级的休戚相关，抗议芬兰政府的罪行，并谴责芬兰职工会中央联合会右翼分子的暴虐态度。瑞典民主人士抨击法吉荷尔姆政府对芬兰劳动人民进行的恐怖行动，揭发这是英美集团政治措施的一部分，英美集团力求借助这些措施，击败芬兰的民主力量，增强侵略性的北大西洋联盟。
    在罢工过程中，右翼社会民主党出卖工人利益的面目愈益显露。二十三日，民主报纸发表联合党（保守党）议会党团一件秘密函件的原文，完全揭穿了右翼社会民主党和联合党勾结的阴谋。该函泄露联合党人支持右翼社会民主党法吉荷尔姆政府，联合党人认为只有社会民主党政府或包括社会民主党的政府，才能成功地抗衡劳动群众为维持其生活水平而进行的斗争，他们对右翼社会民主党在职工会的活动寄以极大希望。民主报纸着重指出，最近的发展，特别是芬兰职工会中央联合会的分裂，证明所有在政府和职工运动中的右翼社会民主党领袖，都在卑劣地执行联合党大资本家的命令。
