Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th. Progressive public opinion in various countries continues to criticize the US government's challenging White Paper on "United States Relations with China." The recently published US Communist Party organ, the "Sunday Worker," pointed out that the White Paper is a new plan by the Truman administration to undermine the Chinese People's Government. The newspaper stated: The White Paper admits that, for US imperialists, all of China has been lost. Acheson made it clear that the main goals of the Truman administration in Asia will be: first, to encourage and support "all present and future developments in China" that will cause rebellion against the People's Government. He thus made it clear that the US government will try to organize traitorous fifth columnists in China. Second, to control the rest of Asia and prevent the development of people's movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries on the Asian continent. This policy is contained in Acheson's slander that the Chinese People's Liberation Army will try to invade neighboring countries.

The French Communist Party's organ, "l'Humanité," emphasized that the White Paper has been forced to admit the failure of American imperialism in China. The victory of the Chinese people is a failure for imperialism and the colonial policy of the United States.

The British "Daily Worker" published another editorial on the 9th, denouncing Acheson's slander in the preface to the White Paper about "Communist aggression." The editorial said: According to the definition of US imperialists, the people or government of any country in the world that attacks capitalism or fights for genuine national independence is regarded as "Communist aggression." The Chinese people have overthrown a corrupt government that plundered and enslaved them, and Acheson hates the Chinese people for this and calls it "Communist aggression." If that is the case, then we now understand even more clearly what the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Pacific Pact are trying to destroy.

　　美英法等国进步舆论
  　严词痛斥白皮书
    是美帝侵略中国失败的供状和破坏新中国的新阴谋
    【新华社北平十四日电】各国进步舆论继续抨击美国政府挑战性的“中美关系”白皮书。最近出版的美共机关报“星期日工人报”，指出白皮书是杜鲁门政府破坏中国人民政府的新计划。该报称：白皮书承认：对美帝国主义者来说，全中国均已丧失。艾奇逊表明，杜鲁门政府在亚洲的主要目标将是：第一、鼓励和支持将造成对人民政府叛乱的“中国现在和未来的一切发展”。他因此表明，美国政府将力图在中国组织卖国贼第五纵队。第二、控制亚洲的其余部分，阻止亚洲大陆殖民地及半殖民地国家人民运动的发展。这个政策包含在艾奇逊诽谤中国人民军将试图侵略邻国的一段话中。
    法共机关报人道报强调：白皮书已被迫承认美国帝国主义在中国的失败。中国人民的胜利，对于帝国主义及美国的殖民政策就是失败。
    英国工人日报于九日再度发表社论，痛斥艾奇逊在白皮书的序言中关于“共产党侵略”的谰言。社论说：按照美帝国主义者的定义，世界上任何国家的人民或政府如果攻击资本主义或者为真正的民族独立而斗争，就被视为“共产党的侵略”。中国人民已推翻了一个掠夺和奴役他们的腐败政府，艾奇逊就对中国人民加以憎恨，称之为“共产党的侵略”。既然如此，那末，现在我们就更加明白北大西洋公约和太平洋公约所加要以毁灭的究竟是什么了。
