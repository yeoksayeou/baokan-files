    On the Nature and Policies Regarding Urban Real Estate and Rent

    Question: Article 7 of the Eight-Point Charter announced by the Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army states that "urban land and housing cannot be treated the same way as rural land issues." What is the reason for this? What kind of exploitation is it when landlords in cities rent out houses and collect rent? What are the principles of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government regarding urban housing and rent policies?

    Answer: Urban housing includes both public and private housing. As for private housing, the reason it cannot be treated the same way as land issues in rural areas is that the ownership relationships and, consequently, the exploitative relationships are generally different. Rural land is a natural resource; although people can develop it, they cannot create a piece of land. Therefore, landlords occupy land and carry out extremely cruel exploitation of peasants. This land ownership system is feudal in nature and is the root cause of our nation being invaded, oppressed, impoverished, and backward. It is the fundamental obstacle to our country's democratization, industrialization, independence, unification, and prosperity. This land system must be abolished. Abolishing the feudal exploitative land system and implementing the "land to the tiller" system is the fundamental task of the New Democratic Revolution. However, the urban housing issue is different. Houses are not natural resources but products of labor. In a commodity-producing society, houses are a kind of commodity. Building houses requires a certain investment and regular expenses for repairs. When rent is collected on the investment in a house, it becomes a form of capital. Therefore, private landlords' possession of houses in cities is generally capitalist rather than feudal in nature. During the New Democratic Revolution, this capitalist ownership of housing should be protected like other private capital (except for bureaucratic capital). As for the occupation of land associated with urban housing, because urban land involves leveling and rearrangement, with some investment involved, and after several transactions, the situation is relatively complicated, and it has become an inseparable part of real estate capital, unlike rural land. Therefore, it should not be dealt with for the time being.

    The leasing of private houses is a special form of capital lending. Marx, in *Capital*, when discussing pure rent—that is, rent excluding land rent—said, "That is the interest and amortization of the capital invested in the house." (Volume III, Chapter 46, page 661) When discussing interest-bearing capital, he also pointed out that houses, according to the nature of their use-value, can only be lent as fixed capital (that is, leased). He described this lending process as follows: "The lender (in the case of leasing a house, the landlord—translator) receives interest regularly and a portion of the value of the fixed capital expended as compensation for periodic wear and tear. And at the end of the term, the unconsumed portion of the lent fixed capital flows back in its natural form." (Volume III, Chapter 21, pages 270-271)

    Since the leasing of private houses is a special form of loan capital, it, like general loan capital, does not constitute any mode of production but exists in class society in different positions. Therefore, the nature of the exploitation involved when private landlords rent out houses and collect rent cannot be generalized. It must be considered: in what kind of society and under what circumstances is the house being leased, what is the specific relationship between the landlord and the tenant, is the rent too high, and are the leasing methods oppressive? Only then can a determination be made. In the semi-feudal and semi-colonial Chinese society before liberation, the exploitative nature of private landlords renting out houses and collecting rent had several different forms.

    The first is capitalist exploitation. Ordinary landlords rent out houses they own privately. The landlord and tenant negotiate the rent freely on an equal footing. After deducting the amortization portion of the house, the rent is roughly equivalent to the legitimate average profit in society. This rent can be considered capitalist exploitation. In a New Democratic society, it is allowed to exist and is protected. However, this refers to pure rent—that is, rent excluding land rent. In reality, the rent generally referred to includes the rent for the land on which the house is built. When discussing the ground rent for building land, Marx especially emphasized that the pure ground rent collected based on land monopoly must not be confused with pure house rent. Marx pointed out that due to the monopoly of construction, the landowner "will carry out the most shameless exploitation of the poor"; and also said: "In rapidly developing cities... the real object of building speculation is ground rent, not house rent." (See *Capital*, Volume III, Chapter 46, pages 660-661) Private occupation of land and the collection of absolute ground rent and differential ground rent, which increases with the development of industry and transportation and the increasing concentration of population, is the main reason for the excessive increase in rent (referring to rent including both pure house rent and land rent) and the development of real estate speculation. This excessive exploitation and speculation must be restricted and banned.

    The second is feudal and bureaucratic-capitalist exploitation. In the cities under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, a small number of bureaucratic capitalists or local bullies monopolized large quantities of houses by means of political power, collected high rents, and often colluded with the government to detain, beat, and scold poor tenants. This kind of rent is a special form of usury and can be considered feudal exploitation. After the liberation of the cities, the real estate of bureaucratic capital and extremely wicked counter-revolutionaries should be investigated and verified, and then sentenced by the people's democratic government according to law and confiscated to be owned by the state. Forcibly collecting high rents or forcibly occupying or leasing houses by relying on privileges should be prohibited. It must be ensured that the leasing of houses can be carried out on a free agreement basis.

    In summary, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government adopt the following principles regarding privately owned urban houses, land, and rent:

    1.  Acknowledge the ownership of real estate generally owned by private individuals, and protect the legitimate and legal operations of such property owners; prohibit any organizations, groups, or individuals from arbitrarily occupying private houses. The real estate of bureaucratic capital must be taken over after investigation and verification; the real estate of war criminals and extremely wicked counter-revolutionaries shall be confiscated by the government after legal judgment and belong to the people's democratic state.

    2.  Private houses are allowed to be rented out, and the lease agreement shall be freely negotiated between the landlord and the tenant. The rent should not be too high, but it should not be too low either. In principle, after deducting the depreciation compensation and necessary repair costs of the house, the interest portion of the rent should be roughly equivalent to the legitimate average profit in society. Land speculation should be prohibited.

    3.  Both the landlord and the tenant should abide by the freely negotiated lease agreement. During the term of the contract, the landlord must repair the house as agreed and must not arbitrarily increase the rent or force the tenant to move out; the tenant must also pay the rent on time as agreed and must not intentionally delay or refuse to pay. The internal equipment of the house should also be protected. If disputes arise between the two parties, they should resolve them through mutual agreement in the spirit of mediation; if an agreement cannot be reached, the People's Government may arbitrate or either party may apply to the People's Court for handling.

    4.  The People's Government has the right to protect urban houses and urge landlords to carry out necessary repairs, and must not allow useful houses to be demolished or collapsed. The government will also levy certain donations and taxes on privately owned houses and land according to a progressive system.

    This policy of the People's Government regarding urban housing is not temporary but will be implemented for a long time. Only in this way can urban residents have enough houses to live in. If such a policy is not adopted, but a contrary policy is adopted, such as the confiscation of houses that was wrongly implemented in some individual cities during the land reform movement, or uncertain and unprotected housing ownership, or unconditionally and unlimitedly forcing down housing rent regardless of specific circumstances, the result will be the destruction of urban housing. When there is no profit to be made from repairing houses and housing ownership is not reliably guaranteed, not only will no one be willing to spend money to build new houses, but even existing houses will not be taken care of or repaired, and may even be arbitrarily dismantled and sold; as a result, the people will not have enough houses to live in, which will be extremely detrimental to the people. The People's Government will definitely build a large number of urban houses in the future to solve the housing problem for citizens, but today the country's resources are mainly used to carry out the people's revolutionary war and to restore and develop production, and it is impossible to invest large amounts of capital in building houses. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage private capital to build houses. To make private capital willing to invest in the construction of houses, it is necessary to protect housing ownership and allow its legitimate and legal leasing, so that capital can be circulated and landlords can make a profit. But how much profit is considered profitable? Due to the complex situation of the house's grade, location, etc., it is impossible and unnecessary to stipulate a rigid rent amount. Only by free agreement between the landlord and the tenant can it be determined. The government's responsibility today is only to eliminate some feudal privileges, forced occupation and rent, speculation, or the act of charging excessively high rents, so that the leasing of houses can be carried out on the basis of free agreement, allowing workers and other working people to have houses to live in and not be excessively exploited; in addition, all urban houses should be regarded as social property and properly supervised. Only in this way can urban houses gradually increase, and the people's housing will not be difficult, creating favorable conditions for the future socialist system of public housing ownership.

    The above is about privately owned real estate and rent. As for publicly owned real estate, the nature of its ownership, and whether its operation involves exploitation and what kind of exploitation it is, depends on which class or classes occupy the dominant position, that is, what class or class alliance the state is. Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, that is, the alliance of the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, the so-called publicly owned real estate is essentially the privately owned property of a small number of large landlords and large bourgeoisie headed by the Four Big Families. This kind of real estate is a tool for privileged people to seek private gain and to exploit and oppress the people. After overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, these publicly owned houses built with the blood and sweat of the people must be taken over entirely by the People's Government. The state-owned real estate of the People's Democratic State, which comes from taking over the real estate of the Kuomintang reactionary government and from confiscating the real estate of bureaucratic capitalists and extremely wicked counter-revolutionaries, belongs to the People's Government, that is, to all the people; to be more precise, it is the public property of the people led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and it is property with a socialist nature; the low rent collected by the People's Government for renting out these public houses is mainly used as a fund for organizing and repairing public houses, and if there is any surplus, it is also used to expand urban construction. (The North China People's Government has expressly stipulated that public housing rent is limited to this purpose, see the third page of the *Beijing People's Daily* on April 11.) This kind of reasonable valuation of the government's allocation, use, repair, and expansion of public property is not exploitation, and the nature is fundamentally different from the rent collected by private landlords using real estate. This kind of reasonable valuation of rent for state-owned public houses is even necessary in a socialist society. For example, the Soviet Union today generally collects this kind of rent.

    According to the above analysis, it can be seen that the idea that you can live in houses for free after the city is liberated, that all rents can be unpaid, or even that urban real estate can be divided equally, is wrong, does not conform to the current and long-term interests of all working people, and cannot be realized.

### 关于城市房产、房租的性质和政策

    关于城市房产、房租的性质和政策
    问：人民解放军总部所宣布的约法八章第七条中说：“城市的土地房屋不能和农村土地问题一样处理”，理由何在？城市里房主出租房屋收取房租，是一种什么性质的剥削？中国共产党和人民政府对于城市房屋、房租政策的原则是什么？
    答：城市房屋有公有房屋和私有房屋的分别。就私有房屋来说，其所以不能和农村中的土地问题一样处理，是因为这两者的所有权关系，从而产生的这两者的剥削关系一般地是不相同的。农村的土地是自然物，人们虽然可以开辟，但是却不能创造出一块土地来。因此地主占有土地并利用土地对农民施行极其残酷的剥削，这种土地所有权制度是封建性质的，是我们民族被侵略、被压迫、穷困及落后的根源，是我们国家民主化、工业化、独立、统一及富强的基本障碍。这种土地制度是必须废除的。废除封建剥削的土地制度，实行耕者有其田的制度，乃是新民主主义革命的基本任务。但是城市房屋问题却与此不同。房屋不是自然物，而是劳动的产品。在商品生产的社会里，房屋就是一种商品。建筑房屋需要一定的投资，而且要经常出资加以修缮，当利用房屋的投资收取租息时，它就成为一种资本。因此城市里私人房主对房屋的占有，一般地不是封建性质，而是资本主义性质的。在新民主主义革命时期，这种资本主义性质的房屋所有权，应当和其他官僚资本以外的私人资本的所有权一样地受到保护。至于和城市房屋相联系的地产的占有，因为城市土地有填平整理关系，有若干投资在内，并且经过几次手的买卖，其情形比较复杂，且已构成房产资本的不可分离的一部分，和农村土地不同，因此目前亦应暂不处理。
    私有房屋的租赁，是资本借贷的一种特殊形态。马克思在资本论中讲到单纯的房租——即不包括地皮的租金在内的房租时，曾经说过：“那是投在房屋上的资本的利息和偿还金。”（资本论第三卷第四十六章，六六一页）在讲生息资本时，他又指明：房屋按照它的使用价值的性质，只能当作固定资本来贷放（就是说，租赁）。他并说明这种贷放过程如下：“贷放者（在租赁房屋的情况下，就是房东——引用者）会定期受得利息，并受得所支出的固定资本价值的一部分，当作逐期磨损的代价。而在限期终了时，所贷放的固定资本之未消耗部分，即在自然形态上流回来。”（同上卷第二十一章，二七○——二七一页）
    私有房屋的租赁，既然是一种借贷资本的特殊形态，因此也就和一般的借贷资本一样，它不能构成任何生产方式，而是以不同地位存在于阶级社会里面。因此，私人房主出赁房屋收取房租是一种什么性质的剥削，不能一概而论，必须要看：房屋是在什么样的社会里、什么样的情况下租赁，房主与房客之间具体的关系如何，租额是否过高，租赁的方式是否有压制性等，然后才可以断定。在解放以前的半封建半殖民地的中国社会里，私人房主出赁房屋收取房租的剥削性质，是有几种不同的情形的。
    第一种是资本主义性质的剥削。一般的房主出赁他私人所有的房屋，房东和房客站在平等地位用自由协商方式议定房租，租额在扣除房屋偿还金部分后，大体上相当于社会上正当的平均利润，这种房租可以认为是资本主义性质的剥削，在新民主主义社会里允许它存在，并加以保护。但是这里说的是单纯的房租——即不包地皮租金的房租。实际上一般所说的房租是包含了房屋建筑于其上的地皮的租金在内的。马克思在论到建筑地的地租时，曾特别强调决不能把基于地皮独占而收取的单纯地租，与单纯的房租混同起来。马克思指出，由于建筑的独占，地皮主“会对于贫民实行最无耻的榨取”；又说：“在急速发展的都市内……真正的建筑投机对象，是地租，不是房租。”（以上见资本论第三卷第四十六章，六六○至六六一页）私人占有地皮并收取绝对地租和随着工业和交通的发达以及人口的日趋集中而日益增加的差额地租，这就是房租（这里所指的是包括单纯房租和地皮租金在内的房租）的过度加重和房产投机发展的主要原因。这种过度剥削和投机行为是必须加以限制和取缔的。
    第二种是封建主义和官僚资本性质的剥削。在国民党反动统治下的城市里，少数官僚资本家或豪绅恶霸，以政治权势垄断多量房屋，收取高额房租，并且经常勾结官府，扣押打骂穷苦房客。这种房租，是一种特殊形态的高利贷，可以认为是封建主义性质的剥削。在城市解放以后，对官僚资本和罪大恶极的反革命分子的房产，经调查确实后，应由人民民主政府依法判决，予以没收归于国家所有；对于凭借特权强收高额房租或强占、强赁房屋，都应加以禁止，务必使得房屋的租赁确能在自由协议的方式底下进行。
    综合起来说：中国共产党和人民政府对于城市私人所有的房屋、地产和房租的政策，采取如下的原则：
    一、承认一般私人所有的房产的所有权，并保护这种产权所有人的正当合法经营；禁止任何机关、团体或个人任意占用私人房屋。对于官僚资本的房产，在调查确实后必须加以接收；战争罪犯和罪大恶极的反革命分子的房产，经政府依法判决，则加以没收，归于人民民主国家所有。
    二、允许私人房屋出租，租约由主客双方自由协议来订立。租额不得过高，但是也不宜太低，原则上应当是除掉房屋折旧赔偿金和必需的修理费用部分后，房租中的利息部分大体上相当于社会上正当的平均利润。地产的投机，应当禁止。
    三、主客双方都应当遵守所自由议定的租约。在契约有效期间，房主必须依约修理房屋，并不得任意增加租价或强令房客搬家；房客也必须依约按时交纳房租，不得故意拖欠不交。对于房屋内部的设备也应该加以保护。双方发生纠纷时，应本调解精神，自行协议解决；协议不成时，可由人民政府仲裁或由任何一方声请人民法院处理。
    四、人民政府有权保护城市的房屋，并督促房主进行必要的修建，不能听任有用的房屋拆毁、倒塌。对于私人所有的房屋、地产，政府并要按累进制分等征收一定的捐税。
    人民政府的这种关于城市房屋的政策，不是暂时的，而是要长期实行的。因为只有这样，才能使城市居民有足够的房屋可住。如果不采取这样的方针，而采取相反的方针，如象土地改革运动中某些个别城市曾错误地实行的没收房屋，或不确定、不保护房屋所有权，不问具体情况无条件、无限制地强制压低房屋租额等办法，结果就会造成城市房屋的破坏。当修盖房屋无利可图而房屋所有权又无可靠保障时，不仅没有人愿意花钱去盖新房屋，而且连旧有的房屋也会没有人管、没有人修，甚至任意拆卖；结果使得人民没有足够的房子住，对于人民反而极为不利。人民政府将来是一定要修筑多量的城市房屋来解决市民的住宅问题的，但是，今天国家的资财主要是用于进行人民革命战争和用于恢复和发展生产，不可能投下大量资本来建筑房屋。因此就需要鼓励私人资本来修建房屋。要使私人资本愿意投入房屋的建造，就必须保护房屋的所有权并允许其正当合法地租赁，让资本可以周转，房主有利可图。但是，怎样才算有利可图呢？由于房屋的等级、地位……等复杂情况，不可能也无须规定硬性的租额，只可以由房主和房客自由协议才能确定。政府今天的责任，只在于取缔一些封建的特权、强占强租、投机取巧或收取过高租额的行为，使房屋的租赁确能在自由协议的基础上进行，让工人及其他劳动人民有房可住并不至受到过分的剥削；此外还应当把所有城市房屋看作社会的财产，加以适当的监护。这样才能使城市房屋日渐增多，人民的居住不发生困难，给将来社会主义的房屋公共所有权制度，造下有利的条件。
    以上说的是私人所有的房产和房租。至于公有的房产，它的所有权的性质，从而它的经营是否存在着剥削关系和剥削属于何种性质，是要看占统治地位的是那个阶级或那些阶级，即国家是什么阶级或那些阶级联盟的国家来决定的。在国民党反动派亦即地主阶级和官僚资产阶级联盟的统治之下，所谓公有房产，在实质上乃是以四大家族为首的大地主大资产阶级少数人所私有的财产。这种房产是特权者假公济私和借以剥削、鱼肉人民的工具。在打倒国民党反动统治之后，这些用人民血汗筑成的公有房屋，必须由人民政府全部予以接管。由于接管国民党反动政府的房产和由于没收官僚资本家及罪大恶极的反革命分子私人所有的房产而来的人民民主国家的国有房产它的所有权属于人民政府，也即属于全体人民，更明确地说：它是工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为主体的人民大众的公有财产，是带有社会主义性质的财产；由人民政府出租这些公共房屋所收得的低额房租，主要是用来作公有房屋整理、修补的基金，如有多余时，并用于扩展城市的建设。（华北人民政府曾明令规定公房房租限于这种用途，参看北平人民日报四月十一日第三版。）这种房租是政府对人民公有财产分配使用和修理、扩展的一种合理取值，不是剥削，和私人房主利用房产所收取的房租，性质根本不同。这种国家公有房屋合理取值的房租，甚至就是在社会主义的社会里，也是必需存在的。例如现在的苏联，就是普遍收取这种房租的。
    根据上述的分析，可见认为城市解放了可以白住房子，一切房租都可以不缴了，甚至以为可以平分城市的房产了，这些想法都是不对的，都是不符合于劳动人民全体当前的和长远的利益的，都是不能够实现的。（新华社北平十一日电）
