Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 7th: Fire prevention organizations and equipment in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China have been greatly improved compared to the past. In the Fushun, Xi'an and other coal mining areas, all mines and factories have long established fire brigades and formulated fire prevention regulations. In the Xi’an Fuguo Mine, male and female workers have formed fire prevention and rescue teams. Male workers are mainly responsible for defending the factory and various equipment, while female workers are responsible for defending the workers' dormitories. The mine's administration, the CCP committee, and the trade union have jointly formed an inspection team to conduct fire prevention inspections once a week. The Jiaohe Coal Mine recently reorganized a voluntary fire brigade with 116 strong workers participating. All wires in the entire mining area have been assigned to special personnel for inspection and repair; the wires in the gunpowder depot have been completely replaced with rubber-insulated wires. A fire lookout tower signal bell has been set up in the mine to quickly indicate the direction after an accident occurs. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company has selected safety committee members from 21 factories, establishing 152 safety groups, with a total of more than 1,000 group members. All factories have fully prepared fire prevention tools. The Northeast Textile Experimental Factory in Shenyang, the Northeast Iron Factory, and six other state-owned factories recently organized a joint protection organization, selecting a total of 250 capable young workers from each factory to form a fire prevention brigade; and selecting young and strong activists to form a joint patrol team and a communication team. Each factory holds a fire prevention joint meeting every one or two weeks to exchange experience and improve fire prevention work. The grain company in Shenyang has recently established fire prevention headquarters in its various warehouses, adding various fire prevention tools such as water carts and water dragons, and establishing inspection and patrol systems. The Mudanjiang Railway Bureau's locomotive section, inspection section, and other units held joint cadre meetings and organized employee discussions on fire prevention in June, breaking the paralysis in the minds of employees and expanding the fire brigade. The locomotive section's 30 locomotives have now been equipped with fire extinguishing water pipes so they can be dispatched to put out fires at any time. In addition, public security organs in Harbin, Changchun, Qiqihar, Jiamusi, Jinzhou and other places inspected fire prevention equipment in local state-owned factories in June and July.

    东北各地矿厂加强防火工作
    【新华社沈阳七日电】东北各地公营工矿企业的防火组织与设备已较前大为健全。抚顺、西安等煤矿区各矿厂，都早已组织了消防队，订立了消防纪律。西安富国矿男女职工分别组成防火救护队，男工主要防守工厂及各种器材，女工则防守职工宿舍。该矿行政、中共党委、工会共同组成检查队，每星期进行一次防火检查。蛟河煤矿最近重新组织了有一百十六名健壮工人参加的义务消防队。全矿区所有电线，都指定专人负责检查、修理；火药库电线则完全换上胶皮线。矿内并设立望火楼信号钟一台，以便事故发生后能迅速指明方向。鞍山钢铁公司有二十一个厂选出了安全委员，建立了一百五十二个安全小组，共有组员一千多名。各厂都充分准备了防火工具。沈阳东北纺织试验厂、东北铁工厂等八个公营工厂，日前组织了联合防护组织，由各厂挑选精干的青年工人共二百五十名，组成防火大队；并由年青力壮的积极分子，组成联合纠察组与通讯组。各厂每一二星期召开一次防火联席会，以交流经验和改进防火工作。沈市粮食公司所属各仓库，最近先后成立防火指挥部，增设水车、水龙等多种防火工具，并建立了检查和巡逻制度，牡丹江铁路局机务段、检车段等单位，六月份曾先后召开干部联席会和组织员工讨论防火问题，打破员工中的麻痹思想，扩大了消防队。机务段的三十余台机车现已都安装了灭火水管，以便随时出动救火。此外，哈尔滨、长春、齐齐哈尔、佳木斯、锦州等地公安机关，亦曾于六、七月间分别检查了各该地的公营工厂的防火设备。
