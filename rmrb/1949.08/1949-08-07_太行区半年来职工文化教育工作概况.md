Overview of Employee Cultural and Educational Work in the Taihang District over the Past Six Months
Taihang Branch of Xinhua News Agency

Since the Taihang District Federation of Trade Unions issued an instruction on "Strengthening Employee Political and Cultural Education" at the beginning of January this year, the trade unions of various public and private factories and mines in the Taihang District have attached importance to this work over the past six months. And preliminary results have been achieved.

I. Training classes have been established to train a large number of employees. The Taihang Federation of Trade Unions, the General Trade Union of Industrial Companies, Jixian Huaxin Textile Factory, the state-owned Wu'an Yihua Textile Factory, and six other units have established employee training classes, with a total of 1,734 employees participating in the training (excluding two units). The Fourth Sub-district and the Jiaozuo Xinhua Coal Mine Trade Union plan to conduct universal training for all employees once this year. Because the working class in the new areas was liberated from the rule of the enemy and puppets not long ago, it has resulted in political ignorance and a lack of understanding. For example, some people think: "Anyway, I earn a day's wage for a day's work. It doesn't matter whether I am the master or not. Farmers can divide the landlords' land, why can't workers divide the factories?" Some employees in state-owned factories believe that "employees are the masters of the factories," while some workers believe that "employees are also exploiters." In response to these confused ideas of the working class, leaders in various places have enthusiastically helped them solve their problems and improve their awareness. Therefore, the training has adopted a policy focusing on class education and policy education, specifically covering: the history of the Chinese Communist Party's struggle and its relationship with the working class, the current international and domestic situation, the New Democratic economic policy, and the current tasks of the employee movement. Facts have proven that this is an effective way to awaken employees' ideological awareness, and short-term training classes can achieve greater results. After receiving training at the Fourth Sub-district Trade Union training class, a section of workers at the Jiaozuo Xinhua Coal Mine had a more correct understanding of the trade union. After their awareness was raised, many factory workers automatically requested to join the trade union, the Communist Youth League, and the Communist Party. The state-owned Wu'an Yihua Textile Factory had 201 trade union members in February, and now it has increased to 295.

II. Employee night schools, after-school programs, remedial schools, technical research associations, and research groups have been established quite extensively to conduct cultural and technical education for workers. According to statistics, 4,050 workers have participated in this kind of organized learning. The educational content is combined with the needs of the factory and mine production. The time is generally one to two hours after work. In terms of teaching methods, political classes use a mixed large-class approach, while the rest are taught by employees with higher levels of education. According to recent understanding, this kind of education has also yielded considerable results. More than 1,000 workers participated in the learning at the Jiaozuo Xinhua Coal Mine, accounting for one-third of the total number of employees in the mine. After testing, the average score for the advanced class was 72, and the average score for the elementary class was 75. After 40 days of study at the Lihua Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, those who were illiterate recognized more than 200 new characters, and those who could not write grammar could write ordinary articles. The Fengfeng Coal Mine No. 3 Factory adopted the teaching method of "integrating learning with application," which has been even more effective. Workers in the advanced mathematics class combined their learning with their work and learned pressure science, and those who learned geometry also learned to read drawings. Technical research associations and research groups have played a significant role in improving workers' skills. The benefits of learning for employees have inspired their enthusiasm for learning. Many workers at the Jiaozuo Xinhua Coal Mine carry notebooks with them and study whenever they have time. Some workers arrive at the remedial school early after work, and some workers said excitedly after taking the test: "I have lived my whole life, and this is the first time I have taken an exam."

III. Employee cultural and recreational activities have also been carried out. The trade unions of ten factories and mines, including the Fengfeng Coal Mine, Taihang Industrial Company, Jin-Yu Coal Industry Company, Lihua Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, and the 7th Ordnance Pharmaceutical Factory, have created ten newspapers printed in letterpress, lithograph, and mimeograph. There are 105 employees in the correspondence groups who regularly contribute to the newspapers and Party newspapers. They have continuously reflected the workers' living conditions and their model deeds on the production front, inspired the workers' production enthusiasm, and improved their writing skills. The various factories and mines under the Taihang Industrial Company have established 27 blackboard newspapers, six Yangko teams, one employee theater troupe, and one singing team. The employee theater troupe of the Huafeng Iron Factory performed five plays such as "Blaming Only Illiteracy" and "Congratulating Achievements" on May 1st. Employees of the Jixian Huaxin Textile Factory, which had just been liberated, also established an "Employee Club," and employees participated in various activities according to their own interests. More than 40 workers participated in the drama group and performed five plays such as "Everything for the Front" and "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland" on May 1st and July 1st. More than 200 people, mostly female workers, voluntarily signed up to learn to sing. During the "July 1st" and "July 7th" periods, they organized a Yangko team of nearly 100 people and sang a quick-board ballad they wrote themselves, "The History of the Chinese Communist Party's Struggle." This kind of cultural activity directly improved the employees' class consciousness and inspired their production enthusiasm.

There are still many shortcomings in the cultural and educational work of employees. The most important is: not linking with the actual lives of employees, and systematically providing employees with a simple education on the materialist view of history of "labor creates the world," so that workers understand that all means of production and material wealth in society are created by the working masses, and that the working masses are the masters of history; so that workers know what the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are, what the capitalist methods and systems of exploitation are, what socialism and communism are, and that capitalism will inevitably be replaced by socialism and communism, and point out the current tasks to the workers. Therefore, some workers still believe: "The revolution will be successful when a New Democratic society is realized." Secondly, there is a lack of timely and regular inspection, summary, and testing. Some factories and mines have conducted regular summaries and tests, and have given material and spiritual rewards to good workers, which has promoted and encouraged everyone's learning enthusiasm. Some factories and mines have been conducting employee education for half a year, but have not yet summarized or tested it, so the cultural and educational work has been lifeless.

    太行区半年来职工文化教育工作概况
    太行分社
    太行区的职工政治文化教育事业，自今年一月初太行职工总会发出关于“加强职工政治、文化教育”的指示后，半年来，各公私营厂矿的职工会，都重视了这一工作。且收到了初步成绩。
    一、开办训练班，大批训练了职工。太行职工总会、实业公司总工会、汲县华新纱厂、公营武安益华纱厂等八个单位，都开办了职工训练班，参加受训职工共达一千七百三十四人（内有两个单位未计）。四分会及焦作新华煤矿职工会，计划要在今年将所有职工普遍轮训一次。由于新区工人阶级从敌伪统治下解放不久，造成了政治上的闭塞与认识上的模糊，如有的认为：“反正是干一天赚一天工资，主人翁不主人翁没啥。农民可以分地主的土地，工人为什么不可分工厂呢？”公营工厂的职员有的认为“职员是工厂的主人翁”，有的工人则认为“职员也是剥削者”。对于工人阶级这些糊涂思想，各地领导上都以热情的态度去帮助他们解决，提高自觉，所以训练都采取了以阶级教育与政策教育为主的方针，具体讲授了：中国共产党的斗争史与工人阶级的关系，国际国内目前形势，新民主主义的经济政策，当前职工运动的任务等。事实证明，这是唤起职工思想自觉的有效办法，时间较短的训练班，却能收到较大的效果。焦作新华煤矿一部工人，在四分区工会训练班受训后，对工会有了较正确的认识。好些工厂的工人觉悟提高后，自动要求加入工会、青年团与共产党。公营武安益华纱厂，二月份有工会会员二百零一人，现已增至二百九十五人。
    二、相当普遍的开办了职工夜校、业余学校、补习学校与技术研究会、研究小组等，对工人进行了文化、技术的教育。据统计，有四千零五十个工人参加了这种有组织的学习。在教育内容上都与本厂、矿生产的需要结合进行。时间皆为下工后一小时至两小时。教课方法上除政治课是采用混合的上大课外，其余由职员中程度高的分别担任教授。据最近了解，这种教育也有相当收获。焦作新华煤矿参加学习的工人达一千余人，占全矿人数三分之一。经过测验，高级班平均七十二分，初级班平均七十五分。利华化学制药厂经过四十天学习，不识字的认了二百多生字，不会文法的能写普通文章了。峰峰煤矿三厂采用了“学用合一”的教学办法，收效更大。高级学数学的工人和工作相结合，学会了压力学，学几何的也学会看图画线。技术研究会和研究小组对于工人技术提高上起了很大作用。学习对职工的好处，鼓舞了职工的学习热情。焦作新华煤矿不少工人都是随身带着笔记本，一有时间就学习，有的工人一下工就早早到了补习学校，有的工人参加测验后，兴奋的说：“活了一辈子，这算是第一次下了考场”。
    三、职工文化娱乐活动也有开展。峰峰煤矿、太行实业公司、晋豫煤业公司、利华化学药厂、兵工七药厂等十个厂矿职工会，创办了十份铅印，石印，油印小报，在通讯小组里共有一百零五个职工经常给小报和党报投稿。连续反映了工人的生活动态及其在生产战线上的模范事迹，鼓舞了职工的生产热情，提高了职工的写作能力。太行实业公司所属各厂矿建立了二十七块黑板报，六个秧歌队，一个职工剧团，一个歌咏队。华丰铁工厂的职工剧团曾于“五一”演出了“光怨不识字”、“贺功”等五个剧。解放不久的汲县华新纱厂的职工，也成立了“职工俱乐部”，职工们都以自己的爱好参加了各种活动。有四十余工人参加了戏剧组，于“五一”、“七一”演出“一切为前线”、“兄妹开荒”等五个剧。自动报名学唱歌的就有二百多人，大部为女工。“七一”、“七七”时，他们组织了近百人的秧歌队，演唱自己编写之“中国共产党奋斗史”快板剧。这种文化活动，直接的提高了职工的阶级觉悟，鼓舞了职工的生产热情。
    在职工的文化教育工作上还存在不少缺点，最主要的是：没有联系职工的实际生活，有准备，有计划的给职工进行浅显的“劳动创造世界”的唯物史观教育，使工人认识社会上的一切生产资料和物质财富是劳动群众创造的，劳动群众是历史的主人翁；使工人知道什么是资产阶级和无产阶级，什么是资本主义的剥削方法和剥削制度，什么是社会主义与共产主义，而资本主义则又必然被社会主义和共产主义所代替，并给工人指出现在的任务等。所以有的工人至今仍认为：“实现新民主主义社会，革命就成功了”。其次是缺乏及时的、定期的检查总结与测验，有些厂矿由于做了定期的总结、测验，并对学习的好工人给予物质上精神上的表扬，推动与鼓励了大家的学习情绪，有些厂矿的职工教育，已进行半年了，尚未总结、测验，因而文化教育工作，表现了缺乏生气。
