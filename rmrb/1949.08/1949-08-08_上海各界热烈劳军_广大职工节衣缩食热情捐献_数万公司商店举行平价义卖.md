    [This Newspaper's Report] Since the enthusiastic launch of the campaign to support the military in Shanghai from all walks of life on August 1st, the action to support the military has expanded to the broad masses of workers and staff practicing economy and enthusiastically donating; flat-price charity sales by tens of thousands of companies and shops throughout the city; the letter-writing campaign to express sympathy and appreciation launched by the Municipal Women's Federation; and publicity through broadcasts, performances, and costumed parades by the literary and art circles. The people of Shanghai are using this to thank the People's Liberation Army for bringing them a new life of freedom and to support the rapid victory of the People's Liberation War throughout the country. The charity sales in the shops generally involve selling at flat prices and donating a portion of the profits. There has been no rise in market prices during the charity sales, and most prices are lower than last weekend. There is also no price gouging in general retail sales. For example, in the yarn market, Jin Cheng 42-count yarn was priced at 920,000 yuan per piece on one day, and retail sales were around 23,000 yuan per small package (40 packages per piece), which is equivalent to the wholesale price. All bathhouses in the city increased their prices by 50 percent to support the military, but prices did not rise and the service was especially attentive. The Wing On, Sincere, and Sun Sun department stores on Nanjing Road had particularly good business one day. Wing On Company alone sold more than 32.5 million yuan in three days (August 1st to 3rd). In other commercial areas, many shops held price reductions in addition to charity sales, with large signs saying: "Merchants compete to sell, citizens compete to buy, everyone enthusiastically supports the military!"
    
    Charity Sales by Industry and Commerce Conclude; Results Expected to Reach Target
    The charity sales by industry and commerce throughout the city concluded on the 3rd, and it is generally estimated that they will be able to reach the predetermined target. On the last day, industries such as shipping and insurance, totaling 18 industries, contacted the Industry and Commerce Military Support Sub-Committee, and they all negotiated to make donations because they had no retail transactions or other reasons. More than 400 bookstores throughout the city sold all books at 20 percent off during the charity sale period and will donate one-third of the total income. Many bookstores, such as Xinhua and Sanlian, were crowded with customers all day long, and the turnover of Sanlian Bookstore doubled compared to normal days. Workers and staff in various industries such as shipping, postal and telecommunications, hardware, and textiles throughout the city are making donations with great enthusiasm through various means of economizing. Workers at Shenxin No. 9 Factory reduced their meat consumption once, saving 400 jin of meat, while staff members reduced their meat consumption for three consecutive days and held a variety show charity performance. The Postal Workers' Union donated more than 17,300 "fold-real" units in one day, and a messenger, Cui Yaorong, donated 30 units, saying: "If the People's Liberation Army had arrived in Shanghai one day later, I would have been shot by the secret agent leader Mao Sen. To thank my benefactor, the People's Liberation Army, I will do my best to donate." The gold donation record board of the China Merchants Bureau rose to 4,884 "fold-real" units in one day. Workers and staff at Wuzhou Pharmacy have donated more than 1.6 million yuan and more than 3,000 pieces of Gu Ben Soap. Workers and staff at the Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory also rushed to produce 3,000 doses of anti-malarial pills and 500 doses of anti-fatigue pills, which were sealed in 3,500 letters of appreciation and sent to the fighting People's Liberation Army. In addition to receiving large amounts of donations and materials, the Women's Military Support Sub-Committee also had many women respond to the call of the Democratic Women's Federation for a letter-writing campaign. The first batch of more than 600 letters received has been sent to the troops by representatives in person.
    
    Citizens Call to Request Donations; Soochow University Students Shine Shoes for Charity Sales
    The literary and art circles organized famous city theater and film actors and musicians to broadcast and perform various programs that they had carefully created on the People's Broadcasting Station all day long, attracting the attention of the people of the city. The Zhenru Military Support Sub-Committee mobilized all the town's radios to the streets to listen to the broadcasts. In one day, there were more than 400 calls to the radio station requesting donations after listening to the broadcasts. A worker who did not want to reveal his name donated his beloved Parker 51 gold pen. An old gentleman surnamed Yao donated a car. A person surnamed Tang was moved after listening to the broadcast of "The Whole Family Supports the Military." He immediately donated a bag of flour, his wife donated a gold ring, and each of his four children donated silver dollars. Another 13-year-old child, Peng Jian'an, personally took a towel, a pencil, and a letter of appreciation to the People's Radio Station. The letter read: "Dear PLA big brothers, you are gentle, love the people, and have iron discipline. This is the best team I have ever seen. Because you are so good, my older brothers and sisters have also joined the army with their pens... to the Southbound Service Corps and the East China Military and Political University to learn from you. Would you like to correspond with me?..." The Literary and Art Circles Military Support Sub-Committee also organized a garden party in Fuxing Park, with three performance stages performing Peking Opera, magic, drama, and music. The Telecommunications Bureau specially sent 18 engineers to help install a nine-headed broadcasting machine so that every corner of the park could clearly hear every sound. Inspired by the enthusiasm for supporting the military, students from Soochow University organized a "Shoe Shining Charity Sales Team" and went to the streets to carry out charity sales labor. The military support movement has also expanded from the urban area to the suburbs. Ten suburban military support branches have now been established. The Wusong Military Support Branch recently received two trucks of military support items. In order to facilitate the people's donation of funds and materials, the Military Support Headquarters has added 21 collection points in addition to the original People's Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank and five newspaper offices.

    工商界义卖结束  成绩可达预定目标

    市民打电话要求捐献  东吴学生擦皮鞋义卖
    文艺界组织了全市著名的剧影演员和音乐家们，整日在人民广播电台播演他们精心创作的各种节目，吸引了全市人民的注意，真如劳军分会则把全镇的收音机动员到大街上进行收听。一天内，因听了广播而打电话到电台进行捐献的有四百次以上。一个不肯说出姓名的职工捐出自己心爱的派克５１金笔。一位姓姚的老先生献出了一辆汽车。一位姓汤的在听了“全家劳军”的广播节目后受到感动，他本人立即捐献了一袋面粉，他太太则捐出一只金戒指，四个孩子也各捐了银洋。另一个十三岁的孩子彭建安亲自拿着毛巾、铅笔和慰劳信到人民电台，信中写着：“亲爱的解放军大哥哥们，您们温和、爱民，有铁一样的纪律，这是我第一次看到的好队伍，我的哥哥姐姐因为您们太好了，也投笔从戎……到南下服务团和华东军大向你们学习了。您们愿意同我通信吗？……”文艺界劳军分会并在复兴公园主办园游大会，分三个演出台表演平剧、魔术、话剧、音乐等。电信局特别派出了十八个工程师帮助装置九个头的播音机，使园内的每一个角落，都可清晰的听到每一个声音。由于劳军热情的鼓舞，东吴大学的同学并组织了一个“擦皮鞋义卖队”，分赴街上进行义卖劳动。劳军运动并已从市区扩大到郊区，现已成立了十个郊区劳军支会，吴淞劳军支会近收到两卡车劳军物品。劳军总会为便利人民献缴款物，除原有委托的人民、中国、交通三银行所属各单位及五家报社代收外，又增加代收处二十一处。
