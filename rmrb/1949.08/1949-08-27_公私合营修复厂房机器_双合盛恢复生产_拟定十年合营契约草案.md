　　Public-Private Partnership Repairs Factory Buildings and Machinery
    Shuanghesheng Resumes Production
  　Draft Ten-Year Joint Venture Contract Prepared
    [Our Newspaper] The privately-owned Beijing Shuanghesheng Five-Star Brewery has largely recovered after five months of public-private partnership.

    The factory was founded in 1915 with private capital. The entire brewing process is mechanized. At its peak, it had more than 450 employees and produced over 110,000 cases of beer annually (48 bottles per case). It was sold in major cities across the country, as well as in Siam, the Philippines, and Southeast Asia. After the "September 18th Incident," it began to decline due to the competition from Japanese beer. After the "July 7th Incident," it was further devastated by the "price limit" imposed by the Japanese puppet government, resulting in annual losses. By the time of the Japanese surrender, annual production had dropped to just over 39,000 cases. During the Kuomintang rule, it suffered a double blow from heavy taxes and the tax-free dumping of American military beer, resulting in the complete loss of all capital. It requested closure three times but was denied, and it barely survived by relying on high-interest loans. Last year, the number of employees had been reduced to just over 150, and only 5,000 cases were produced and sold throughout the year. On the eve of the liberation of Beiping, Kuomintang bandit troops entered the factory, extorted cash, burned down warehouses, and dismantled and sold all equipment, raw materials, and machine parts. Finally, they conspired to shell all the buildings and machinery, but failed. At the beginning of liberation, the factory's machinery was in disarray, and the factory buildings were empty. The capitalists not only had no ability to restore production, but also owed employees four months of wages with no money to pay. The capitalists attempted to dismiss the workers; the workers actively demanded that the capitalists pay wages and start work, in order to solve their long-term living problems through production. This led to a fierce labor-capital dispute. Later, the capitalists sent representatives to the government to request loans or investments to help them start production and resolve the labor-capital dispute. The People's Government, recognizing the urgent need to restore production and solve the urgent needs of the workers, conducted on-site investigations and confirmed that the capitalists were indeed unable to restore production on their own. It then consulted with the capitalists to implement a public-private partnership, appointed Sun Xuande as a temporary resident representative of the factory, and allocated government funds to pay wages and purchase equipment and raw materials, while simultaneously repairing the factory and starting brewing. At the same time, the problems existing in the factory were further discovered: First, the old shop style had been seriously preserved for decades; second, the egalitarian low wages. The former included a redundant bureaucratic structure with a general manager, manager, deputy manager, consultant, and factory director, leading to mismanagement and embezzlement; the latter included workers receiving the same monthly wage of two bags of flour, regardless of their technical skills. Thus, to implement enterprise management, it was necessary to first transform the organizational structure. Therefore, Sun Xuande, on the one hand, led and supervised the restoration work of the entire factory, and on the other hand, relied on the workers to overcome conservative views, initially transformed the organizational structure, established a relatively scientific system, saved expenses, prevented corruption and waste, appropriately adjusted wages, promoted the enthusiasm of the workers, and improved production efficiency. After five months of efforts by all employees, the machinery and factory buildings have been largely repaired, production has been basically restored, and brewing will begin at the beginning of next month.

    Recently, after extensive investigation and understanding by reporters, this public-private partnership approach has many advantages for privately-owned industries that the capitalists are unable to restore on their own. It can utilize the existing residual base and technical conditions to achieve a faster recovery, and reduce the difficulties of insufficient capital, purchasing and transporting raw materials, and promoting finished products in private operations. It avoids the anarchy of private production and makes the management more planned, in line with the principles of benefiting both the public and private sectors, labor and capital, and developing production. From the perspective of this factory, this method has gained the widespread support of capitalists and workers. Supervisor Zhou Songshan (one of the shareholders) happily said: "Our factory was sick and about to die. The government came to save it, and we can still make a profit. Otherwise, selling the buildings and land would not be enough to repair the machinery." He also said: "The most troublesome labor-capital disputes in the past are no longer a problem." Worker Zhao Zhenrui said that the capitalists could not afford to start production, and the state did not have time to repair the factory. Public-private partnership to develop production, the country increases wealth, the capitalists get profits, and we workers also have a guarantee of life.

    Currently, the factory is about to produce beer, and many people from various places are placing orders. In order to lay the foundation for long-term development in the future, after careful consultation between the public and private sectors, a draft ten-year public-private partnership contract has been prepared. Its main contents are: First, it is determined that all machinery and buildings before the factory starts operation belong to the old Shuanghesheng, and the right to use them belongs to the new Shuanghesheng. All expenses after the start of operation, machine repairs, etc., are borne by the new Shuanghesheng, so the private sector no longer claims depreciation of machinery and buildings, and this depreciation only serves the purpose of cost accounting. However, any new factory buildings and machinery added in the future will belong to the new Shuanghesheng. According to current government regulations, the alcohol industry is a government monopoly, but after deducting all expenses for raw materials and wages, the factory's manufacturing profit is determined to be 30%. As for the use of old machinery and buildings, there is no rent, and the government's investment is also interest-free. The profit is divided, with the government receiving 80% to 85% and the private sector receiving 15% to 20%. In terms of operation and management, it is determined that both parties will mutually appoint general managers and deputy managers to jointly manage and operate the factory. The above contract will be formally signed as soon as both parties finally agree. (Shang Kai)

　　公私合营修复厂房机器
    双合盛恢复生产
  　拟定十年合营契约草案
    【本报讯】北平私营双合盛五星啤酒厂，五个月来经公私合营的结果，现已大体恢复。
    该厂于一九一五年由私人资本创办。全部制酒过程，均为机器装备。最盛时期，职工曾达四百五十余人，年产啤酒十一万余箱（每箱四十八瓶）。销售于全国各大都市，以及暹逻、菲律宾、南洋各地。“九一八”后受日本啤酒之排挤，开始走向萧条。“七七”以后，更受敌伪政府“限价”之摧残，逐年赔累，日寇投降时，年产量降至三万九千余箱。国民党统治时期，受苛重捐税与美国军用啤酒免税倾销之双重打击，全部资金赔累净尽。曾三度要求歇业未准，依靠重利贷款苟延残喘。去年职工已减至一百五十余人，全年仅产销五千余箱。北平解放前夕，国民党匪军开进该厂，逼索现金，焚毁库房，所有器材原料、机器零件全部拆卖一光。最后，曾阴谋炮轰全部楼房建筑与机器装备，未遂。解放之初，该厂机器狼藉，厂房一空。资方不但恢复无力，且拖欠职工四个月的工资无钱照发。资方曾企图遣散工人；工人则积极向资方要求发资开工，从生产中解决长期生活问题。因此发生了激烈的劳资纠纷。后资方派遣代表向政府要求贷款或投资，扶助其开工生产，并解决劳资纠纷；人民政府鉴于该厂生产急待恢复，工人生活急需解决，经实地调查，证明资方确已无力自己恢复，乃与资方商定实行公私合营，委派孙宣德为临时驻厂代表，并由政府拨款支付工资，购买器材原料，一面进行修复，一面开始酿制。同时进一步发现了该厂存在的问题：一是过去几十年来相当严重地保留着旧店铺作风，二是平均主义的低额工资，前者如上设总经理、经理、副理、顾问、厂长等一套重叠的官僚机构，乱当家、乱拿钱；下则一群先生、伙计，缺乏严格的分工与科学的生产制度。后者如：工人不分技术高低，每人每月一律是两袋面粉的工资。这样，要实行企业化的经营管理，首先要改造组织机构。于是孙德宣一面领导监督全厂的恢复工作，一面依靠工人，努力克服保守观点，初步的改造了组织机构，建立了比较科学的制度，节省开支，防止了贪污与浪费；适当的调整了工资，发扬了工人的积极性，提高了生产效率。经全体员工五个月努力，机器厂房已大体修竣，生产已基本恢复，并将于下月初开始出酒。
    最近经记者多方调查了解，对于资方无力恢复的私营工业，此种公私合营的方式，确有许多优点。它可以利用现有残存基础与技术条件进行较迅速的恢复，而且减少私人经营中资金不足，购运原料及推销成品之困难；避免了私人生产的无政府状态，使经营较有计划，合于公私兼顾，劳资两利，发展生产的原则，从该厂看，这个办法获得了资本家与工人的广泛拥护。监理周松山（股东之一）愉快的说：“我们的厂子，本来有病，快要死了，政府来把它救活了，我们还能获得利润，不然拆房子卖地皮也不够修理机器的。”他又说：“过去最头疼的劳资纠纷，现在已不再成为问题了。”工人赵振瑞说，资本家开不起，国家现修工厂也来不及，公私合营发展生产，国家增加财富，资本家分得利润，我们工人生活也有了保障。
    目前该厂即将出酒，各地前来定货者颇多。为奠定今后长足发展的基础，经公私双方周密磋商，已拟就有效十年之公私合营契约草案。其主要内容为：首先确定该厂开工前，所有机器房屋概归旧双合盛所有，而使用权归新双合盛。开工后一切款项开支，机器修理，概由新双合盛负担，故私方不再索取机器房屋折旧，而此项折旧只起成本核算之作用。但今后添置厂房机器则归新双合盛所有。按照目前政府法令，酒业为政府专卖，但除去原料工薪一切开支成本外，确定该厂制造利润为百分之三十。至于使用旧有机器房屋，概无租金，而政府投资亦无利息，所获利润，规定政府得百分之八十至八十五，私方得百分之十五至二十。在经营管理上确定双方互派正副经理，共同管理经营。上述该项契约，一俟双方最后同意，不日即可正式签字。（商恺）
