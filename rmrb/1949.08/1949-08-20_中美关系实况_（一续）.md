The Truth About Sino-American Relations (Continued)
Wang Cheng

What is the so-called "traditional friendship between China and the United States"?

American imperialists and their running dogs always like to talk nonsense about how long or short the "traditional friendship between China and the United States" is. Many young people have also read the lies about "traditional friendship between China and the United States" in the textbooks designated by the Kuomintang reactionary government for many years! Therefore, many people think that the United States has been bad to us only in recent years, and they were quite good to us before!

History cannot be distorted. Let us now study what the so-called "traditional friendship between China and the United States" is all about.

Originally, the United States, which was founded on capitalism, had no colonies before the end of the 19th century. By the time American capitalism developed to the stage of imperialism, the world's territories had already been divided up by other imperialists. At the beginning of the 20th century, American imperialism wanted to expand its commodity market and seize raw materials and investment sites, and China was a piece of fat that the United States would certainly not let go of. Therefore, it put forward the slogan of "Open Door Policy" and "Equal Opportunity," meaning very clearly that it wanted to re-divide China.

When Washington was in office, American ships had already sailed to Guangdong (1784) to purchase tonics (ginseng, tea) and import drugs (opium). Following the signing of a series of unequal treaties between China and Britain, the United States took the opportunity to sign the aggressive Treaty of Wanghia with China. Since then, whenever other imperialists obtained any rights in China, the United States would always use the "Open Door Policy" and "Equal Opportunity" as an excuse to get a piece of the pie.

For example, during the Guangxu reign, Japan actively invaded Korea. The United States at that time very much wanted to trade with Korea, fearing that Japan would monopolize Korea, which would be detrimental to its own interests. Therefore, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out, it came forward to uphold "justice" in the 20th year of Guangxu (1894) and ordered its ambassador to Japan to advise Japan:

"The United States government cherishes friendship with both Japan and Korea, so it hopes that the Japanese government will respect the independence and sovereignty of Korea. If Japan sends troops for no justifiable reason, the President of the United States will truly regret it."

From the wording of this advice, it seems that the United States came forward to uphold "justice" in order to "respect the independence and sovereignty of Korea," but in fact it was just trying to get a piece of the pie. Therefore, when Japan explained that its stationing troops in Korea was to deal with China and would not infringe upon the interests of the United States, it kept silent. However, as a result of the Sino-Japanese War, China was defeated, and the United States was a little afraid, fearing that if China was annexed by Japan, it would be detrimental to the United States. Therefore, it appeared again in the first month of Guangxu's 20th year as a "mediator," and ordered its ambassador to Japan to declare to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs:

"The President of the United States, with sincere friendship, hopes for peace in East Asia, so that neither China nor Japan will lose face, and is willing to act as a mediator."

This was a way to kill two birds with one stone. The United States used mediation to give Japan practical benefits and China face, and itself obtained the right to invest in China based on the Treaty of Shimonoseki.

After the Sino-Japanese War, the imperialist countries that had arrived in China earlier had all obtained their own "spheres of influence" in China. The main military ports, commercial ports, and original territories of China had already been occupied by them. Only the United States was a step late and had not gotten anything. Therefore, it formally put forward the slogan of "Open Door Policy" and "Equal Opportunity" to strive to participate in the division of China.

In 1899 (Guangxu 25th year), US President McKinley ordered Secretary of State John Hay to propose the following declaration on the "Open Door" to China to Britain, France, Germany, Japan, and other countries:

"In order to avoid conflicts between countries and to seek equal commercial and industrial interests for all countries in China, the United States government hopes that all countries with spheres of influence and spheres of interest in China will recognize the following conditions:

First, all countries shall not interfere with each other's spheres of influence in China, such as leased territories or other benefits already obtained;

Second, the ports within the spheres of influence of the powers shall, for goods of any country, comply with the current Chinese customs tax rates (except for free ports), and the customs duties shall be collected by the Chinese government.

Third, the ports within the spheres of influence of the powers shall not collect port taxes on ships entering from other countries that are higher than those levied on their own ships. Furthermore, the railways within the spheres of influence of the powers shall not charge transportation fees for goods from other countries that are higher than those for their own goods."

The gist of this declaration is that you cannot monopolize China, I also have a share. As a result of this declaration, the United States gained the right to enjoy the same rights in China as other powers. This was a great gain for the United States.

In January 1905, when Japan and Russia signed the Treaty of Portsmouth, John Hay again demanded that neither Japan nor Russia should damage the integrity of Chinese territory in the final negotiations with any country or neutral country. Under this banner, the United States strove to achieve the result of returning the administrative power of the Manchurian region to China in the conclusion of the Treaty of Portsmouth. This does not mean that the United States particularly cherished China, because in doing so, it also maintained its interests in this commercial and investment site.

After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan became stronger and ignored the American "Open Door Policy," not allowing Americans to enter Manchuria from Niuzhuang, and the goods of British and American tobacco companies had to pay the Likin and taxes that Japanese goods did not have to pay. Therefore, in 1909, US Secretary of State Knox proposed that all existing railways in Manchuria should be bought back by China and managed internationally, and that unfinished lines should be constructed by international capital groups. This was of course to打击打击日本，不过借中国收买之名，好使自己投资和操纵而已。

When World War I broke out (1914), Japan took advantage of the fact that the powers had no time to look eastward and occupied my Jiaoji Railway, and in the following year put forward the Twenty-One Demands to destroy China. This certainly hindered the interests of the United States, so Wilson made suggestions to China and Japan on May 13th of that year (1915):

"The conditions discussed between China and Japan this time have been going on for a long time and have not yet been resolved. The content is very confidential, and the US government does not know it. However, it must declare to both China and Japan that if the conditions agreed upon between China and Japan harm the interests of the United States under the treaty in China, or harm the integrity of Chinese territory and the Open Door Policy, the US government will not recognize them." Here, the so-called "maintaining the integrity of Chinese territory" by American imperialism is of course false, and insisting on the "Open Door Policy" is true. As is well known, the fifth item in the Twenty-One Demands was cancelled due to the opposition of American imperialism, but American imperialism recognized the other items. Does the signing of the Twenty-One Demands maintain the "integrity of Chinese territory"? In fact, after the United States obtained practical benefits, and in view of the outbreak of the October Socialist Revolution in Russia, the two robbers compromised and finally signed a shameful Lansing-Ishii Agreement that harmed China's sovereignty (November 7, 1917). This declaration stated:

"1. Japan has special geographical relations with China, so the United States recognizes that Japan has special interests in China;

2. Although Japan has special interests in China, it must preserve the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty and prevent interference with the development of other countries' industry and commerce in China;

3. In the future, if there is any infringement of China's sovereignty, independence, and equal opportunities for industry and commerce, the United States and Japan should deal with it together."

The American imperialists, who shouted loudly about "maintaining the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty," were at peace with each other after they recognized their respective interests in China. Afterwards, they sent an official document to the Chinese government saying:

"After Ambassador Ishii went to the United States, the United States and Japan had an open and honest discussion on their interests in East Asia. The ambassador stated that his policy towards China was by no means intended to be aggressive, but that due to the geographical situation, Japan had special interests in China. Now the United States and Japan declare that they should abide by the Open Door Policy, but because countries that are close in national territory enjoy various special rights."

Doesn't this official document tell us very clearly that American imperialism is helping Japanese imperialism to invade China?

When the World War ended, at the Paris Peace Conference, the Chinese representatives requested the revision of unequal treaties, the return of leased territories, tariff autonomy, and the cancellation of consular jurisdiction, etc. When there were eleven articles, the American imperialists, who had always prided themselves on "maintaining the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty," treated these just demands coldly!

However, the powerful Japanese imperialists took an inch and attempted to further invade China. Therefore, in 1921, American imperialism united the powers threatened by Japan and held the Pacific Conference to prevent Japanese expansion. This conference, as well as the subsequent Nine-Power (US, Britain, Japan, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, France, China) Conference,打击打击当時の最大的敌人日本帝国主义，巩固了它在中国侵略势力。 But American imperialism said that this was a manifestation of "friendship" towards China.

Of course, the contradictions between imperialists are fundamentally unsolvable. The "September 18th Incident" tore up the Nine-Power Treaty. This was of course "greatly inconsistent" with the US policy of "Open Door" and "Equal Opportunity." (Quote from then-US Secretary of State Stimson) Thus, the so-called "Stimson Doctrine" was produced. The "Stimson Doctrine" was merely non-recognition of Japan's occupation of Manchuria. As a result, in addition to the empty resolution of the League of Nations not recognizing "Manchukuo," there was in fact no practical effect. Japan's aggression did not change in the slightest because of this. Not only that, when the Chinese people took up arms to resist the Japanese invaders, American imperialism also equipped the Japanese bandits with scrap iron and gasoline to slaughter the Chinese people!

During the Opium War, the United States helped Britain. At the end of the Opium War, following the signing of the Treaty of Nanjing between China and Britain, the United States and China concluded the Treaty of Wanghia (1844). In this treaty, the United States obtained consular jurisdiction in China and, without paying any price, obtained the same privileges as Britain had obtained in the war. When the Anglo-French allied forces attacked Beijing, the US Navy covered the Anglo-French troops and captured Guangzhou; during the battle of Baihe, the US military covered the Anglo-French troops in their retreat. After the Qing government signed the Treaty of Tianjin with Britain and France, the United States signed a treaty with China in the eighth year of Xianfeng (1858), and also obtained the commercial privileges that Britain had obtained from the war. During the Taiping Rebellion, the United States also participated in the war to suppress the Taiping Army. The American Hua Te (Ward) recruited foreigners in 1860 to attack Songjiang, Qingpu and other places for the Manchu Qing government. After Hua Te died in battle, the Qing government issued an edict to reward him and granted him the rank of Third Grade Official. When the Taiping Army approached Shanghai, the United States took the opportunity to obtain administrative power over the foreign settlement in Shanghai and established a public trial hall. During the Boxer Rebellion, the United States united with Britain, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Austria and other powers in 1899 to form the Eight-Nation Alliance, attacked the Boxers, occupied the Dagu Forts, captured Tianjin and Beijing, massacred the Chinese people, and signed the Boxer Protocol. As a result, China paid reparations, abolished its military preparations, and placed Tianjin under the control of imperialism. Later, when the Northern Expedition army arrived in Nanjing, US warships bombarded Nanjing. This is even more well known.

American imperialism, a robber who came to China late, acquired China's tariff rights, concession rights, judicial rights, inland river navigation rights, and troop stationing and berthing rights through such aggressions. These are all historical facts before the Anti-Japanese War, and do these facts written in blood still fail to illustrate what the so-called "traditional friendship between China and the United States" is all about? The statement that "the United States used to be quite good to us" is completely inconsistent with the facts.

　　中美关系实况　（一续）
    王城
    所谓“中美传统友谊”是什么？
    美国帝国主义者及其走狗们，总爱说“中美传统友谊”如何长，如何短的鬼话，一般青年，也多年在国民党反动政府的钦定教科书上读了“中美传统友谊”的谎言！因此，有不少人认为：美国对咱们不好，是近年来的事，以前人家对咱们可不错呢！
    历史是不容歪曲的。我们现在来研究一下，所谓“中美传统友谊”究竟是怎么回事。
    原来，以资本主义立国的美国，在十九世纪末以前，没有什么殖民地，迄美国资本主义发展到帝国主义阶段，世界上的领土，早被其他帝国主义瓜分完了，到二十世纪初，美国帝国主义要扩大商品市场，夺取原料及投资场所，而中国是一块肥肉，美国当然不肯放过，因此它便提出“门户开放”、“利益均沾”的口号，意思很明白，就是要重新瓜分中国。
    当华盛顿在任的时候，已经有美船开到广东（一七八四年）采购补品（人参、茶叶），输入毒品（鸦片烟）。继中英诸不平等条约的签订，美国便乘机与中国签订侵略的望厦条约。从此，举凡其他帝国主义在中国得到什么权利，美国总以“门户开放”、“利益均沾”为借口，都要分一杯羹的。
    如光绪年间，日本积极侵略朝鲜，美国当时很想与朝鲜通商，怕日本独占朝鲜，对自己不利，所以在中日战争爆发，便于光绪二十年（一八九四年），出而主持“正义”，曾命驻日大使忠告日本说：
    “美国政府对于日本和朝鲜，均笃于友谊，故希望日本政府对朝鲜之独立主权，加以尊重。如日本兴无名之师，则美国总统，实为惋惜。”
    从这个忠告的字面上看，美国好象是为了“尊重朝鲜的独立主权”，出而主持“正义”的，但事实上只不过为了想捞一把，因此，当日本解释它所以驻兵朝鲜，是为了对付中国，决不犯及美国的利益时，它便不啃气了。但是中日战争的结果，中国吃了败仗，美国就有点怕了，怕的是如果中国被日本吞并，对美国不利。因此它又在光绪二十年一月，以“调人”姿态出现，又命驻日本大使向日本外务省宣言：
    “美国大总统，以真诚友谊，希望东亚和平，使中日两国，均不毁名誉，愿任调停之劳。”
    这是一个一箭双雕的办法，美国用调停的手段，给日本以实利，予中国以面子，自己便根据马关条约，取得了对中国投资的权利。
    中日战争以后，先到中国的各帝国主义国家，此时都在中国取得了自己的“势力范围”，中国各主要军港、通商口岸，以及原有属地，此时都业已被它们霸占了，独美国一步来迟，未捞到手，所以这时它便正式提出“门户开放”、“利益均沾”的口号，争取参加瓜分中国。
    一八九九年（光绪二十五年），美国总统麦利金，命国务卿海·约翰（Ｊｏｈｎ　Ｈａｙ）向英、法、德、日诸国提出下列对中国“门户开放”的宣言：
    “美国政府，为免除各国之冲突起见，及谋各国在华工商业同等之利益，希望在华有势力范围及利益范围之各国，承认下列之条件：
    一，诸国对于中国所得之势力范围，如租地或已得之别项利益，互不相干涉；
    二，列强势力范围内之港口，无论对于何国货物，皆须遵守中国现行海关税率完纳（除自由港外），其关税归中国政府征收。
    三，各国势力范围内之港口，对于他国入港之船只，不得征收本国船舶以上之入港税。又各国势力范围内之铁道，对于他国货物运输，亦不收本国货物以上运输费。”
    这个宣言的要旨，就是说你们不能独占中国，还有我的一份呢。结果，经这次宣言，美国却取得了在中国享受和其他列强同样的权利。这是美国的大收获。
    到一九○五年一月，日俄签订朴资茅斯条约时，海·约翰又要求日俄两国在最后谈判中，任何一国和中立国都不能损害中国领土的完整。在这种招牌下面，美国争到在朴资茅斯条约缔结中，把满洲区域的行政权归还中国的成果。这并非意味着美国特别爱护中国，因为如此，它也就保持了在这一商业和投资场所的利益。
    日俄战争以后，日本强大了，不管美国的“门户开放”的那一套，不准美国人由牛庄进入满洲，英、美烟草公司的货物要纳日货不必交纳的厘金和税项。于是在一九○九年美国国务卿诺克斯（Ｒｎｏｘ）便提出满洲一切既成铁路由中国收买归国际管理，至未成线则归国际资本团建设的意见。这当然是为了打击日本，不过借中国收买之名，好使自己投资和操纵而已。
    当第一次世界大战爆发，（一九一四年）日本乘列强无暇东顾的时候，侵占我胶济铁路，并于次年提出灭亡中国的二十一条件，这当然妨害到美国的利益，因此威尔逊在当年（一九一五年）五月十三日向中日两国提出意见：
    “此次中国和日本所商议之条件，闻早已开始至今尚未解决。其内容甚密，美国政府不得而知。但不得不向中日两国声明，如中日所订条件，其有妨害美国在中国条约上之利益，或使中国领土之完整及门户开放主义有害者，美国政府一律不承认。”这里，美国帝国主义所谓“维护中国领土之完整”当然是假的，坚持“门户开放”是真的。如所周知，二十一条中第五号因为美国帝国主义的反对而取消了，但其他各条，美国帝国主义是承认了的。难道二十一条的签订是维护“中国领土的完整”吗？其实美国既得到实利，同时鉴于俄国十月社会主义革命爆发，这两个强盗就妥协了，它们最后签订一个危害中国主权的可耻的石井蓝辛宣言（一九一七年十一月七日）。在这个宣言里说：
    “一、日本与中国有地理上的特殊关系，故美国承认日本在中国有特殊之利益；
    二、日本在中国虽有特殊之利益，但须保全中国领土主权之完整，以及妨害他国在华工商业的开展；
    三、将来凡有侵害中国主权之独立，及工商业均等机会者，美日两国应协同对付。”
    口口声声喊“维护中国领土主权完整”的美国帝国主义，当他们互相承认了各自在华的利益后，就相安无事了。之后曾以一纸公文交中国政府说：
    “石井大使赴美以后，于美日两国于东亚利益曾得开诚布公之讨论。大使声明对华之政策，决非存意侵略，不过以地理形势上之关系，日本在中国发生特别利益。兹美日两国宣言应守门户开放主义，惟因国境地位接近之国家，得享受种种特别权利。”
    这个公文难道还不很明白的告诉我们，美国帝国主义是在帮助日本帝国主义侵略中国吗？
    迄大战结束，在巴黎和会上中国代表要求修改不平等条约，归还租借地，关税自主，撤消领事裁判权等十一项条款时，素以“维护中国领土主权完整”自豪的美国帝国主义，对于这些正义要求，冷然处之！
    可是，强大了的日本帝国主义它得寸进尺，又企图进一步的侵略中国。因此，在一九二一年，美国帝国主义便联合受日本威胁的各列强，举行太平洋公议，防止日本扩张。这次会议以及以后召开的九国（美、英、日、比、意、荷、葡、法、中）会议，打击了当时它最大的敌人日本帝国主义，巩固了它在中国的侵略势力。但美国帝国主义说，这是对华“友谊”的表现。
    当然，帝国主义间的矛盾是根本解决不了的。“九一八”事变，就撕毁了九国公约。这当然对美国的“门户开放”、“机会均等”的政策是“大相抵触的”。（当时美国国务卿史汀生语）于是有所谓“史汀生主义”的产生。“史汀生主义”，就是对日本侵占满洲的不承认而已，其结果，除了产生国联不承认“满洲国”的空头决议外，事实上并没有什么实际效果。日本的侵略并不因此而有丝毫的改变。不仅如此，当中国人民拿起武器抵抗日本侵略者的时候，美国帝国主义还以废铁和汽油装备日本强盗屠杀中国人民呢！
    在鸦片战争的时候，美国是帮助英国的。至鸦片战争结束，继中英江宁条约的签订，美国和中国订立了望厦条约（一八四四年），在这个条约里，美国在华取得了领事裁判权，并不费任何代价的又取得了同英国一样在战争中所得到的特权。当英、法联军进攻北平的时候，美国海军掩护英、法军队，陷我广州；在白河作战时，美军又掩护英、法军队逃遁。当清政府和英、法签订天津条约后，美国继在咸丰八年（一八五八年）与中国签订条约，又取得了英国从战争中得到的商务方面的特权。在太平天国革命时，美国同样参加了镇压太平军的战争。美人华特（Ｗａｒｄ）于一八六○年募集洋人，替满清政府攻打松江、青浦等地。华特战死后，清政府曾下诏奖赏，并赐三品顶戴。当太平军直逼上海时，美国又乘机取得了上海外人居留地的行政权，并设立公审会堂。而在义和团暴动时，美国又联合英、日、法、德、意、奥诸列强，于一八九九年组织八国联军，进攻义和团，占领大沽炮台，陷天津和北平，屠杀中国人民，订立辛丑和约。中国因此赔了款，撤销了军备，置平津于帝国主义控制之下。此后北伐军队到达南京的时候，美舰则炮轰南京。这更是众所周知的事情了。
    美国帝国主义，这一个迟来中国的强盗，就经过这种种侵略，取得了中国的关税权、租界权、司法权、内河航行权和驻军停泊权等等。这都是抗日战争以前的史实，而这些血写的史实，难道还不能说明所谓“中美传统友谊”究竟是怎么回事？“美国以前对咱们还不错”的说法，是完全不合乎事实的。
