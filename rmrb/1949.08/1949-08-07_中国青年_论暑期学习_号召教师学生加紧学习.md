Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 6th. "China Youth" weekly published an editorial in its fourteenth issue entitled "On Summer Learning," stating:

    In the newly liberated cities, the people's government's education departments, the Communist Youth League committees, student federations, etc., are all using great effort to organize summer learning for students and primary and secondary school teachers. This is extremely necessary. Regarding summer learning, we offer the following suggestions:

    First: The summer learning curriculum should not be too extensive. It is impossible to completely learn historical materialism, the basic problems of the Chinese revolution, and the New Democratic policies within one summer. If you study too much, it cannot be digested. Therefore, it should be appropriately reduced, and it is even acceptable to only study one or two of the most urgently needed courses. Even when studying one or two courses, there should be a focus, and it should be linked to practice.

    Second: Only by voluntarily participating in study groups and consciously engaging in learning can one learn well. In the study groups, the leadership should allow all participants to freely express their opinions on the content of the courses they are studying and to engage in debate. Because correct viewpoints can only be further developed in debate and become everyone's own.

    Third: In addition to the Communist Youth League members participating in learning becoming activists in their studies, the learning leadership organization should also pay attention to discovering more activists. With activists in learning, they can not only understand the learning situation but also organize and help everyone study. The leadership organization should discover and cultivate these activists and, on a voluntary basis, recruit non-Communist Youth League members to become Communist Youth League members.

    In addition, it is also essential for general students to make up for cultural lessons and engage in sports and entertainment activities during the summer vacation.

    This summer vacation has only two weeks left. Time flies. Teachers and students participating in learning: Intensify your studies! Strive to become competent teachers and excellent students after the summer vacation!

    “中国青年”论暑期学习
    号召教师学生加紧学习
    【新华社北平六日电】中国青年周刊第十四期以“关于暑期学习”为题发表社论说：
    在新解放的城市中，人民政府的教育机关、青年团的团委、学联等都用很大的力量，组织学生、中小学教师的暑期学习。这是十分必要的。关于暑期学习，我们提供下列几点意见：
    第一：暑期学习课程不宜太多。要想在一个暑期内，把唯物史观、中国革命基本问题、新民主主义政策等全部学完，是不可能的。学的东西太多，就没法消化。所以应该适当地减少，甚至只学一两门最迫切需要学习的课程就可以。即使学一两门课，也应该有重点，并且联系实际。
    第二：只有自愿地参加学习班，自觉地进行学习，才能学好。在学习班里，要有领导地放手让一切参加学习的人，对他所学习课程的内容，提出各种意见，展开争论。因为正确的观点，只有在争论中才能更加发展，才能成为大家自己的东西。
    第三：除了参加学习的青年团员要成为学习中的积极分子以外，学习的领导组织还应当注意发现更多的积极分子。学习中有了积极分子，不但可以通过他们了解学习情况，并且可以通过他们组织与帮助大家学习。领导的组织应发现与培养这些积极分子，并在自愿的原则下吸收非青年团员成为青年团员。
    此外，一般学生在暑假中补习文化课，进行体育娱乐活动，也是不可少的。
    今年暑假，还只有两个星期的时间，光阴易逝，参加学习的教师学生们：加紧学习！争取暑假后成为胜任的教师、优秀的学生！
