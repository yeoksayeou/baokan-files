Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 11th: TASS, Budapest - A competition to complete and exceed grain delivery plans ahead of schedule is developing among Hungarian farmers nationwide. Hungarian working farmers have achieved a bumper harvest of grain, industrial crops, and fodder, as well as fruits and vegetables this year. Many poor and middle peasants have significantly exceeded their grain delivery quotas. The Hungarian National Economic Council has allocated two million forints (Hungarian currency) to reward farmers, rural cooperatives, and collective farming cooperatives who perform best in grain deliveries. Last year, the Hungarian government also allocated two million forints as bonuses for farmers and cooperatives, and two hundred cooperatives received various agricultural machines as bonuses.

    匈牙利丰收
    农民超额缴纳谷物
    【新华社北平十一日电】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：争取提早完成并超过交纳谷物计划的竞赛正在匈牙利全国农民中发展着。匈牙利劳动农民今年的谷物、工业作物和饲料以及水果和菜蔬都获得了丰收，许多贫农和中农已大大地超过了他们缴纳谷物的定额。匈牙利全国经济委员会已拨款二百万佛罗林（匈币），用以奖励在缴纳谷物中表现最好的农民、农村合作社和共耕合作社。去年匈政府亦曾拨款两百万佛罗林，作为对农民与合作社的奖金，曾有两百个合作社得到作为奖金的各种农业机器。
