Inquiry and Reply

    To Mr. Li Peiyin, Ma Zilong, Luo Yimin, and Dai Yang:
    Regarding your questions forwarded by the People's Daily concerning:
    One, how can a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioner begin to practice medicine legally?
    Two, which authority should one contact to apply for a medical practice license?
    Three, what qualifications constitute a qualified TCM physician?
    Four, what are the registration procedures for TCM practitioners?
    Five, can a TCM practitioner temporarily put up a sign and practice medicine before obtaining a formal license?
    Six, if a registered TCM practitioner causes a patient's death, is it considered medical malpractice?
    Seven, how should TCM practitioners newly arrived from rural areas or those who have lost their credentials proceed if they wish to practice medicine in the city?
    Eight, is income tax levied on TCM practitioners?
    Nine, which People's Government organ has taken over the pseudo-Kuomintang Hebei Examination and Qualification Office? etc., the Municipal Health Bureau replies as follows:
    One, both TCM and Western medicine practitioners must await the promulgation of measures by the Municipal People's Government and apply for licenses in accordance with the regulations before they can open a practice.
    Two, you should apply to the People's Government Health Bureau, but the measures have not yet been approved, so it is currently impossible to process applications.
    Three, the qualifications for TCM practitioners in this city must also await the promulgation of review or other measures by the People's Government and be handled in accordance with the regulations to be considered qualified.
    Four, this can only be known after the People's Government promulgates registration and practice measures.
    Five, No.
    Six, whether causing a patient's death after registration constitutes medical malpractice depends on whether the physician had professional negligence. However, even registered physicians may inevitably make mistakes that lead to a patient's death. Conversely, this should not be a reason not to hold registration. Only a strict attitude during registration is necessary.
    Seven, all physicians who come to this city to practice or whose credentials are lost must proceed in accordance with the measures stipulated by the People's Government.
    Eight, physicians do not pay income tax; medicine merchants must.
    Nine, unknown.

专栏：询问与答复

　　中医怎样才能合法开业？李培荫、马子龙、罗一民、戴阳诸先生：
    人民日报转来你们所问关于
    一、中医怎样方能开始执行医生业务？
    二、声请行医执照应向何机关洽办？
    三、中医以什么资格方为合格医师？
    四、中医声请登记手续如何？
    五、中医在没有正式执照以前，可否暂先挂牌应诊？
    六、中医登记后治死人是否算庸医？
    七、新从乡间来的及证件遗失的中医如欲在都市行医应如何办理？
    八、执行中医业务是否缴纳所得税？
    九、伪国民党河北考铨处，由人民政府何机关接收？等问题，承市卫生局答复如下：
    一、中西医开业均须俟本市人民政府将办法公布后，按章请领执照，方能开业。
    二、应向人民政府卫生局声请，不过现在办法尚未奉核定，目前尚不能办。
    三、本市中医资格，亦须待人民政府将审查或其他办法公布后，按章办理，方为合格。
    四、亦须待人民政府将登记开业办法公布方能得知。
    五、不可。
    六、登记后治死人，是否算庸医？那要看这个医师有无业务上的过失来判断了。不过登记后的医师也难免一定无过失，以致治死人。反之，更不能因此而不举办登记。只有在登记时取严谨的态度。
    七、凡来本市开业的，或是证件遗失的医师，均须按人民政府规定的办法办理。
    八、医师不缴所得税，药商须纳。
    九、不知。
