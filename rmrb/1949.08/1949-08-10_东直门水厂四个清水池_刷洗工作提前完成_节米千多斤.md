    Dongzhimen Water Plant Completes Cleaning of Four Clear Water Reservoirs Ahead of Schedule
    Saving Over a Thousand Jin of Rice
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Dongzhimen Water Plant of the Beiping Water Company, relying on the efforts of all workers, completed the cleaning of its four clear water reservoirs ahead of schedule, saving over a thousand jin of rice. In the past, the water plant was cleaned every five to six years. During the period of Japanese puppet rule, after the Sun River water source was abandoned and wells were rebuilt, it had not been cleaned for ten years. After the liberation of Beiping, in order to ensure the cleanliness of the people's water supply, the company planned to thoroughly clean the reservoirs. It was estimated that washing the three reservoirs twice would require at least 600 workdays. After the work began, technician Yi Chengxun relied on the workers to cooperate in the work. For most of the temporary workers introduced by the district trade union, the contracting system was abolished, and the workers were allowed to organize themselves and discuss how to allocate work. After work each day, the workers gathered together to review and criticize each other, and discuss how to improve their skills. After the first reservoir was washed, technician Yi Chengxun accepted the workers' suggestions. Originally, iron cylinders were used to scoop up mud, which was difficult to dump. Now, sacks were used instead. Also, the method of brushing and scooping at the same time was changed to scooping sand first and then brushing the walls. This accelerated the cleaning speed of the second and third reservoirs by one-third. Each reservoir was washed three times, and 27 cubic meters of sand were excavated. The entire cleaning work was completed eight days ahead of schedule, saving two hundred workdays, which is equivalent to saving more than a thousand jin of rice, based on five and a half jin per temporary worker per day.

    东直门水厂四个清水池
    刷洗工作提前完成
    节米千多斤
    【本报讯】北平市自来水公司东直门水厂四个清水池的洗刷工作，依靠全体工人的努力，提前完成任务，节省小米千余斤。该水厂过去每隔五六年洗刷一次，在日伪统治时期，废除孙河水源改建水井后，迄今十年没有清除过。北平解放后，该公司为了保障人民用水清洁，计划彻底把水池清理干净，据估计，三个池子洗刷二次，最少需工六百个。工作开始后，技术员伊承勋依靠工人协同进行工作，对大多数从区工会介绍来的小工，废除了包工制，采取工人们自己组织起来，自已商议如何分配工作的办法，每天工作完了，工人们又在一起互相检讨、批评，商量如何改进技术。当第一池洗刷完竣后，技术员伊承勋接受了工人们的建议，原来用铁筒掏泥，倾倒困难，改用麻袋；又把一边刷一边掏的办法改为先掏砂子后刷墙。这样使第二池、第三池的清除速度加快了三分之一。且每个池子都洗刷了三次，挖出砂子二十七立方米。整个清除工作，提前八天完成，节省了二百个工，按每个小工每天五斤半计算，共节省小米一千多斤。（天奕）
