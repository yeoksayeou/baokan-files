　　Strengthen the Protection of National Property
    Bohai District Party Committee Calls on All Agencies to Conduct a Universal Inspection of Financial and Economic Management
    [Shandong News] The Bohai District Party Committee recently convened over a thousand cadres from directly subordinate units of the Party Committee, Administrative Office, and Military Region for education on protecting national property and proposed several specific measures. Comrade Wang Zhuoru, Deputy Secretary of the District Party Committee and Director of the Administrative Office, pointed out that due to the great military and political victories of our army, the remaining enemies have shifted from open to secret activities, sabotaging our production and construction. We must resolutely suppress them. After analyzing the current difficulties in production and construction and the conditions for overcoming these difficulties, Comrade Wang Zhuoru proposed: 1. Conduct a universal education within the entire Party to establish a new concept of the people's motherland and launch an ideological struggle against not cherishing the property of the people's motherland. Based on study and inspection, and in conjunction with specific circumstances, formulate resolutions to prevent the development of losses, especially in financial and trade departments, starting with self-criticism at the leadership level. 2. Implement a universal inspection of financial and economic management, starting with directly subordinate agencies and proceeding downward level by level. The inspection should not be for the sake of inspection; problems identified must be resolved. With a high degree of responsibility to the people, combine the resolution of problems with addressing cadre issues. The interests of the people must not be placed in a secondary position under the guise of "taking care of cadre emotions." Resolutely and appropriately remove cadres who neglect their duties and make necessary adjustments to cadres who are incompetent or have weak capabilities, and supplement and improve their leadership. After the inspection, warehouse rules and various safety measures should be formulated. 3. Sort out some illegal or unmanaged materials, promoting joint action by the Party, government, army, and people, treating this as part of the leadership's work. 4. Implement streamlining, practice strict economy, give full play to the initiative of all cadres, and improve work efficiency. 5. Strengthen the security work of agencies, opposing complacency and carelessness. Establish organizations, form agency security committees, plan and formulate measures, with leaders taking responsibility, cadres leading, and everyone participating, combining this with the protection of national property to do a good job in the security work of agencies.

　　加强爱护国家资财
    渤海区党委号召各机关普遍开展财经管理检查
    【山东讯】渤海区区党委近召集党委、行署、军区各直属单位千余干部进行爱护国家资财的教育，并提出几项具体措施。区党委副书记兼行署主任王卓如同志指出由于我军在军事、政治上的伟大胜利，残余敌人已由公开转为秘密，破坏我们的生产建设。我们必须予以坚决镇压。在分析了目前生产建设的困难与克服困难的条件后，王卓如同志提出：一、在全党进行一个普遍教育，树立新的人民祖国观念，展开反对不爱护人民祖国财产的思想斗争。根据学习与检查，结合具体情况订出决议，杜绝损失的发展，尤以财经贸易等部门，首先在领导上进行检讨。二、实行普遍的财经管理的检查，先从直属机关开始，逐级向下进行。不是为检查而检查，检查出问题必须解决。以高度为人民负责的精神结合解决干部问题，不得以所谓“照顾干部情绪”，而将人民利益放在次要地位，必须坚决和适当的撤换玩忽职守的干部，对不称职或能力薄弱的干部进行必要的调换，和充实健全其领导。检查以后应该订出仓库规则与各种安全措施。三、整理一些不合法或没人管理的物资，推动党政军民一齐动手，将此作为领导工作内容的一部分。四、实行精简，厉行节约，发挥全体干部的积极性，提高工作效率。五、加强机关保卫工作，反对麻痹大意。建立组织，成立机关保卫委员会，规划制定，首长负责、干部领导、大家动手，和保护祖国财产结合起来，做好机关保卫工作。
