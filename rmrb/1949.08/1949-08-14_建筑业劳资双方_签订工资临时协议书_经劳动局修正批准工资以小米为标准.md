    Construction Industry Labor and Management
    Sign Temporary Wage Agreement
    Labor Bureau Revises and Approves Wages Based on Millet Standard
    [This City News] The temporary agreement between labor and management in the city's construction industry was officially signed yesterday (the 13th). The wages of workers in this industry in June were temporarily 500-600 yuan per day for large laborers (equivalent to 12-13 jin of millet) and 300-400 yuan per day for small laborers (equivalent to 7-8 jin of millet). Recently, as prices have risen, wages have not been reasonably adjusted. The wages of large and small laborers are only equivalent to 6-7 jin and 3-4 jin of millet, respectively, resulting in many disputes. After negotiations between labor and management in the industry, a temporary wage agreement was drafted on August 9, stipulating that wages would be based on the millet standard: 12 jin for large laborers and 8 jin for small laborers. This agreement was reviewed by the Labor Bureau, which considered that stipulating fixed wages was inconsistent with the spirit of developing production, improving technology, and adapting to supply and demand. It suggested revisions: the standard wage for large laborers should generally be 12 jin of millet, and the standard wage for small laborers should generally be 8 jin of millet, but they could be increased or decreased depending on the circumstances. However, the minimum wage should not be lower than 10 jin for large laborers and 6 jin for small laborers. At the meeting yesterday where labor and management representatives signed the temporary agreement, Deputy Director Ma Guangdou of the Municipal Labor Bureau explained the significance of the revisions. Both parties unanimously approved the agreement, and the representatives happily signed it. Deputy Director Ma announced the approval on the spot. The effective period of the temporary agreement is from August 15 until the date of the official establishment of the labor-management collective contract for the industry.
