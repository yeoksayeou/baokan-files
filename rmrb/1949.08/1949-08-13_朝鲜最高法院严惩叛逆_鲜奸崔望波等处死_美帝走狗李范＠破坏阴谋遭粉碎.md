Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: TASS, Pyongyang, 9th: The trial of terrorists and saboteurs Choi Mang-bo, Kim Yeon-nok, Han Cheon-seok, and Ahn In-yeop (all names transliterated) has concluded in Pyongyang. These terrorists were personally dispatched to North Korea by South Korean puppet "Prime Minister" Lee Bum-suk. Investigation and interrogation proved that after the failure of sabotage activities in Seodo (transliterated), Lee Bum-suk organized a new group of saboteurs and terrorists and sent them to North Korea. Choi Mang-bo and Kim Yeon-nok accepted Lee Bum-suk's special mission, crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea with false passports and 100,000 North Korean won. In February of this year, they arrived in North Pyongyang and met Han Cheon-seok in Pyongyang, where they drew up detailed plans for assassination, sabotage, and arson. However, they failed to realize this plan and were forced to leave Pyongyang and return to South Korea to report to their leader Lee Bum-suk in order to obtain new instructions, weapons, and money from Lee. They arrived in Seoul and gave Lee Bum-suk a fabricated report on their activities. This report was believed by Lee. He promised to give them three million won and weapons such as grenades. A few days later, these people were ordered to go to North Korea again. According to Lee Bum-suk's instructions, they received ten grenades, explosives, and 120,000 won, and were ordered to establish a sabotage and terrorist group in Pyongyang to engage in sabotage, arson, and assassination of certain leaders of the People's Government. However, the saboteurs were uncovered by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The Supreme Court of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea examined the materials of the case in open court and confirmed the criminal acts of the defendants. The defendants confessed to their treasonous acts. The Supreme Court sentenced Choi Mang-bo, Kim Yeon-nok, and Han Cheon-seok to death by firing squad, and Ahn In-yeop, an accomplice, to twenty years in prison.

    美帝走狗李范＠破坏阴谋遭粉碎
    【新华社北平十二日电】塔斯社平壤九日讯：恐怖分子与破坏分子崔望波、金延诺、韩天锡及安荫业（人名均译音）的审判，已于平壤结束。这些恐怖分子都是南朝鲜伪“总理”李范＠亲自派至北朝鲜的。调查与审讯证明：李范＠在西都（译音）破坏活动失败之后，又组织了新的破坏分子与恐怖分子集团，并将其派至北朝鲜。崔望波与金延诺接受了李范＠的特别任务，拿着假护照与十万元朝鲜币，越过北纬三十八度，潜入北朝鲜。今年二月，他们来到北平壤，并在平壤遇到了韩天锡，拟出了暗杀、破坏、放火等详细计划。但是他们未能实现这一计划，被迫离开平壤，返回南朝鲜向他们的头子李范＠回报，以便从李处取得新的指示、武器及金钱。他们到了汉城，给李范＠递了关于他们活动的捏造报告。这个报告为李相信了。他答应给他们三百万元和手榴弹等武器。数天后，这些人奉命再到北朝鲜。根据李范＠的指示，他们领了十枚手榴弹、炸药及十二万元，奉命在平壤建立破坏分子与恐怖分子集团，从事破坏、放火及刺杀某些人民政府领袖的行为。然而，破坏分子为内政部所破获。朝鲜人民民主共和国最高法院于公开审讯中检查了该案的材料，证实了被告的犯罪行为。被告对他们的叛国行为已供认不讳。最高法院判处崔望波、金延诺及韩天锡处以枪决，从犯安荫业处以二十年徒刑。
