　　Supporting the Front Lines, Accelerating National Liberation, and Thoroughly Eliminating U.S. Imperialist Forces in China
  　Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Democratic Women's Federation
    [Beiping City News] The Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Democratic Women's Federation issued a statement condemning the U.S. imperialist White Paper. The full text is as follows:
    We believe that this is a helpless confession. It exposes a series of facts about American aggression against China over the past century, which is enough to awaken those who are confused by U.S. imperialist propaganda and harbor illusions about U.S. imperialism. We, the Chinese people, have enough experience in the long-term struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism to distinguish between enemies and friends and see through all the conspiracies of imperialism and its running dogs. The attempts of U.S. imperialism to divide the unity of the Chinese people, undermine the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, slander the Chinese Communist Party, and denigrate the Soviet Union are all futile.
    We women of Beiping have fresh memories of the aggression and atrocities of U.S. imperialism. It has not only seized our territory, airspace, and territorial waters, and seized our sovereignty, but also insulted our sister Shen Chong and countless innocent compatriots in Beiping and other major cities; it has provided money and guns to directly help the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang massacre the Chinese people; it has supported Japanese imperialism as a vanguard against communism and the Soviet Union. The existence of U.S. imperialist forces for even one day is absolutely incompatible with the interests of the Chinese people, especially the broad masses of Chinese women. Now that Beiping has been liberated, and all imperialist forces and their running dogs have been driven out of here, the imperialists are unwilling to fail and will not automatically withdraw from China. We women of Beiping must, together with all the people of Beiping, continue to be vigilant and resist U.S. imperialist interference, work hard to support the front lines, accelerate national liberation, and thoroughly eliminate U.S. imperialist forces in China; at the same time, we must stand more firmly on the side of the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union and sweep away imperialist forces from every corner of the world. This is our most powerful answer to the U.S. imperialist White Paper.

　　支援前线加速全国解放彻底扫除美帝在华势力
  　北平民主妇联筹委会
    【平市讯】北平市民主妇联筹委会发表声明，谴责美帝的白皮书，全文如下：
    我们认为这是一纸无可奈何的供状，它暴露了一百年来美国侵华的一连串事实，这很足以唤醒那些迷惑于美帝欺骗宣传，对美帝存有幻想的人们。我们中国人民，在长期反帝、反封建、反官僚资本的斗争中，已有足够的经验来分清敌友，看穿帝国主义及其走狗的一切阴谋。美帝分化中国人民的团结、破坏中苏人民的友谊、诽谤中国共产党、诋毁苏联的企图，都是徒然的。
    我们北平妇女，对美帝国主义的侵略和暴行，记忆犹新。它不但攫夺我们的领土、领空、领海，攫夺我们的主权，还在北平和各大城市，污辱了我们的姊妹沈崇和无数无辜的同胞；它出钱出枪直接帮助蒋介石匪帮屠杀中国人民；它扶植日本帝国主义作为反共反苏的先锋。美帝国主义势力存在一天，和中国人民尤其是中国广大妇女的利益是绝不相容的。现在，北平已被解放，一切帝国主义及其走狗势力已从这里驱除出去了，但帝国主义者是不甘失败，不会自动退出中国的。我们北平妇女必须与全北平人民一道继续警惕与抵抗美帝的干涉，努力支援前线，加速全国的解放，彻底扫除美帝在华势力；同时更坚定的站在以苏联为首的民主阵营方面，把帝国主义势力从世界的每一个角落里扫荡干净，这就是我们对于美帝白皮书最有力的回答。
