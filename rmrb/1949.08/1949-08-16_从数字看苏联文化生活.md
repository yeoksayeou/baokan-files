From numbers to see Soviet cultural life
    The Soviet Union now has a total of 8,000 trade union clubs, cultural centers and palaces of culture, 67,000 "red corners" (a type of club), 5,000 libraries and 5,000 movie theaters. In 1948 alone, 33.5 million people attended lectures in clubs, cultural centers, and palaces of culture.
    In 1948, more than 27 million copies of central and local newspapers and magazines were published in the Soviet Union.
    In 1913, Russia had only 859 newspapers. In 1948, the Soviet Union had more than 7,000 newspapers.
    Books published in Russian alone in 1938 were almost eight times as many as in 1913. In the thirty years since the establishment of the Soviet regime, 873,000 books have been published in 119 languages, with a total circulation of 11 billion copies, which is equal to five and a half times the total number of books published in the last thirty years of Tsarist Russia.
    In 1930, there were less than 1.5 million radio receivers in the Soviet Union, which increased to 5 million by 1941, and reached 7 million by 1948.
    Soviet radio broadcasts are conducted in the languages of all Soviet nationalities and in 32 foreign languages.

　　从数字看苏联文化生活
    苏联各职工会现在共有八千个俱乐部、文化之家和文化宫，六万七千个红角（一种俱乐部），五千个图书馆和五千个电影放映处。一九四八年中，仅在俱乐部、文化之家和文化宫，即曾有三千三百五十万人听讲演。
    一九四八年，苏联的中央的报章杂志以及地方报纸，共发行二千七百万份以上。
    一九一三年，俄国仅有八百五十九种报纸。一九四八年，苏联有七千余种报纸。
    一九三八年仅以俄文出版的书籍，即几乎为一九一三年的八倍。在苏维埃政权建立以来的三十年间，以一百一十九种文字出版了八十七万三千种书籍，总发行额为一百一十亿本，等于沙俄最后三十年间所出版书籍总数的五倍半。
    一九三○年，苏联的无线电收音处不到一百五十万处，至一九四一年，即增为五百万处，至一九四八年，则已达七百万处。
    苏联的无线电广播是以苏联各民族的语言及三十二种外国语言进行的。
