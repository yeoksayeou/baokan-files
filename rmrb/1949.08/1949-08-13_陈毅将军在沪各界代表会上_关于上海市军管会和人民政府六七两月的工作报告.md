Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th:

    General Chen Yi, Director of the Shanghai Military Control Commission and Mayor of the Shanghai People's Government, delivered a "Work Report on the Shanghai Military Control Commission and the People's Government in June and July" at the Shanghai People's Representatives Conference on the 3rd of this month. The report has been unanimously approved by the representative conference. The full text is as follows:
    Fellow representatives, ladies and gentlemen:
    Shanghai was completely liberated on May 27th of this year, and it has been over two months. On behalf of the Shanghai Military Control Commission and the Shanghai People's Government, I will give a brief report to all representatives on our work over the past two months. I would like to explain: Firstly, the process of liberating Shanghai; Secondly, the takeover work in the past two months; Thirdly, the specific work during the military control period; Fourthly, the work that the Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government should do in the future. After listening to my report, representatives are requested to offer their suggestions for improvement to the work of the Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government.
  I. The Process of Liberating Shanghai
    The People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River on April 21st, liberated Nanjing on April 23rd, and liberated Hangzhou on May 3rd. After that, it began to deploy the battle to liberate Shanghai. The battle on the outskirts of Shanghai began on May 12th. On May 24th, our eastern and western corps clamped down on the Wusong Fortress, blockaded the Wusong port, and completely cut off the enemy's retreat. On May 25th, a general offensive was launched on all sides, and Shanghai was completely liberated on May 27th. In this campaign, a total of 230,000 enemy troops were annihilated, including 150,000 captured and surrendered. The chief of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government had fled in advance. Acting Mayor Zhao Zukang led the municipal government personnel to raise the white flag and surrender gloriously to the People's Liberation Army. This method is beneficial to the people. This situation proves that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is extremely unpopular, to the point that it could not even take its government personnel with it. It also proves that Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's Eight Points of Attention have deeply penetrated the hearts of the people. Thanks to the dedication of most of the personnel of the old municipal government, the files and public equipment from the time of the old Shanghai Concession Public Works Bureau, through the Japanese occupation, to the Kuomintang era, were completely handed over to the people. This method is possible and will inevitably develop to the provinces of Northwest, Southwest, and South China, including Taiwan. The battle to liberate Shanghai was won through bloody battles and overcoming difficulties. In the battle to liberate Shanghai, the bravery and hard work of the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army are worth mentioning. The troops who came from thousands of miles away to liberate Shanghai braved the rain and arrived in just ten days of rapid marching. Because weapons such as machine guns, mortars, infantry guns, and mountain guns, as well as a large amount of ammunition, could not be carried by pack animals, they were completely carried by infantry, overcoming the mud on the roads for more than a thousand miles, which was not easy. In addition, our army, from the battalion-level cadres to the corps commander, because mules and horses could not cross the river ahead of the troops during the pursuit of the enemy, marched on foot to the outskirts of Shanghai for a month like the soldiers, which is also commendable. The Chiang bandits had made long-term preparations for the defense of Shanghai, using Shanghai's modern architecture and industrial equipment to create three lines of defense: outer, main, and core. Chiang bandits' fortifications included 5,000 reinforced concrete bunkers, 3,000 American-style mobile concrete bunkers, and more than 10,000 satellite fortifications and semi-permanent field shelters. Each bunker was also arranged with three to nine sub-defenses. The People's Liberation Army had to take these strongholds one by one through bloody battles. The Chiang bandits once boasted that Shanghai's defenses were "33 percent stronger than the defense of Stalingrad," and that they would "defend for six months to a year to save the situation and turn defense into offense," and adopted methods of moving, destroying, looting, and extorting in an attempt to destroy Shanghai. However, thanks to the rapid advance and heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, and the active protection of factories and schools by the people of Shanghai, the destruction of Shanghai was still relatively small. The main lesson here is that by relying on the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the labor and wisdom of the Chinese people, we will be able to overcome all difficulties and defeat all enemies. Liberating Shanghai took this path, and building Shanghai will inevitably take this path as well. After the liberation of Shanghai, due to the difficulties caused by the enemy's blockade, a few people wavered and expressed pessimism, hesitation, and even complaints. It is beneficial for me to raise the lessons learned from the fierce battle with the enemy to liberate Shanghai here. Is it possible to successfully build a new Shanghai without overcoming even greater difficulties?
    II. The Takeover Work in the Past Two Months
    When we deployed to cross the river and liberate Nanjing and Shanghai, we began to prepare for the takeover of Shanghai, established various specialized committees to conduct specialized research, and asked people who understood the situation in Shanghai and solicited their opinions on the takeover. We knew that to take over and manage a large city like Shanghai, we must treat the takeover work with a humble and learning attitude. We divided the takeover into four major departments: 1. Political affairs department; 2. Military department; 3. Financial and economic department; 4. Cultural and educational department. We unified the institutions of the Kuomintang puppet central government and the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government and assigned them to the above four departments for unified takeover. The puppet municipal departments will gradually be returned to the jurisdiction of the People's Government during the period of military control. The central enterprises and the enterprises of various provinces and cities that do not belong to the municipal scope are currently being taken over and managed by the Military Control Commission on behalf of the central government and various provinces and cities, and are prepared to be returned to the central government and various provinces and cities in the future.
    We divided the entire takeover work into three stages: takeover, management, and transformation. The takeover work generally includes handover, inventory, and takeover, mainly to ensure that there is no disruption and that the continuation of work and business is not affected during the military control period. At this stage, many traces of the Kuomintang reactionary system are temporarily retained, and there is not much change. In the management stage, the main focus is on research and investigation, and partial transformation and reorganization are started. The traces of the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary system begin to be cleared, and the people's democratic system begins to be established. In the transformation stage, the focus is on completely or largely eliminating the Kuomintang's reactionary system and consolidating the establishment of the new people's democratic regime. The political affairs department and the military department carry out a comprehensive and thorough transformation according to the excellent military and political systems of the liberated areas; the economic department and the cultural department retain the parts that conform to the interests of the people and the laws of science, and change the parts that are against the interests of the people and the laws of science. Generally speaking, the economic, industrial, and cultural departments will change less than the political affairs department and the military department. But this is only in terms of technical scope. The basic policies of the economic, industrial, and cultural departments are still the same as those of the political and military departments, that is, they must be used for the purpose of serving the people, replacing the Kuomintang reactionaries' anti-people and reactionary policies.
    (1) Municipal takeover work: The takeover includes nine bureaus: Finance, Health, Public Works, Public Utilities, Education, Land Administration, Civil Affairs, Police, and Social Affairs, as well as a Food Allocation Office and a Documents Committee. The Municipal Government Headquarters took over ten departments: Investigation, Personnel, Secretariat, Accounting, News, Foreign Affairs, General Affairs, and Public Relations, with a total of more than 49,000 old personnel and employees. Except for most of the old staff of the Investigation Department and Personnel Department who fled or went into hiding, more than 95% of the remaining bureaus and departments remained in their original positions and continued to work as usual, awaiting disposal and employment. We abolished the puppet Social Affairs Bureau and established the Industry and Commerce Administration and the Labor Bureau. The Food Allocation Office was abolished and the Shanghai Grain Corporation was established to manage grain supply. A Property Management Office was established to manage the clearing and allocation of real estate. A Foreign Affairs Office was established to manage overseas Chinese affairs, and the office took over the puppet central government's foreign affairs agencies in Shanghai and other related institutions.
    (2) Financial and economic takeover work: This item includes taking over 411 units belonging to the puppet Kuomintang Municipal Government and the puppet central government, including banks, factories, and warehouses, with important assets including 24,600 taels of gold, 360,000 yuan of silver, 210,000 billion yuan of puppet gold yuan, 240 million yuan of puppet Taiwan currency, 35,000 tons of Taiwan sugar, 470,000 dan of grain, and 18,000 new and old cars in varying conditions, and 48.87 million gallons of gasoline. A total of more than 153,000 former employees worked in the above agencies.
    (3) Cultural takeover work: In terms of higher education, 26 colleges and universities were taken over, including 2,796 professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, researchers, and staff, and 8,109 students. In terms of municipal education, 503 public schools and educational institutions were taken over, with 5,517 teachers and staff and 176,418 students. In terms of news and publishing, 52 units were taken over and placed under military control, including 25 newspapers and news agencies, 30 bookstores and printing plants, and 3 radio stations and equipment factories, with a total of 2,314 personnel. In terms of literature and art, 13 units were taken over, including 9 film units and 4 theaters, with a total of 173 employees and 165 technicians. Private colleges and universities at all levels have not been taken over or placed under military control, and the handling methods will be discussed after the national education undertakings are handled.
    (4) Military takeover work: The takeover deployment is divided into five departments: training, political work, logistics, air force, and navy. The enemy's army was replaced by battlefield annihilation, and the remaining task was to clean up the battlefield and deal with prisoners of war. There were 38 army barracks, most of which were damaged. Experts estimate that initial repairs would cost 20 billion RMB. To save expenses, repairs were suspended, and People's Liberation Army commanders and fighters were organized to do voluntary labor to carry out temporary repairs. The training department only took over a few military schools, which were completely empty houses that had been destroyed. The political work department only took over two puppet political work teams, one printing factory, and seventeen radio stations, plus 30 units, including drama, film, and bands, all of which were small institutions and were all dispersed and incorporated into the People's Liberation Army for transformation and service. The takeover work of the above two departments ended the fastest. The logistics department took over a total of 116 units, with 7,748 workers, 1,393 staff, 52 students, 227 technicians, 2,599 medical workers, 103 political workers, 9,574 wounded and sick soldiers, 3 general-level officers, 392 colonel and lieutenant-level officers, 7,697 soldiers, 515 miscellaneous personnel, 2,954 family members, and 1,440 other personnel, totaling 34,697 people. The units taken over by the logistics department are the supply, repair, clothing, and medical service agencies of the enemy's joint logistics system. The air force takeover department took over a total of 12 units, taking over 1,220 air force personnel, 1,455 civil aviation personnel, and 40 air force aviation engineers and technicians. The air force was better preserved than the army, and the civil aviation aspect was even better preserved. In addition, 3,349 air force and civil aviation houses were taken over, of which 1,834 were usable. The navy takeover department took over a total of 18 units, 14 warehouses, 82 workers, 154 technicians, 58 staff, and 80 odd-job men. The navy was more severely damaged than the air force, and there was almost no complete institution.
    Due to the correctness of our takeover policy, the efforts of the takeover personnel, and the sympathy and assistance of the people of Shanghai, the takeover work in the past two months has successfully completed the preliminary takeover task. Now the takeover work should be transferred to the second stage of management and partial transformation.
  III. Specific Work during the Military Control Period
    (1) Municipal aspects: We have successively carried out the work of eliminating the remaining enemies, removing war traces, restoring order in urban areas, maintaining law and order, restoring traffic order, removing garbage, carrying out epidemic prevention injections, evacuating and providing relief to refugees, clearing shantytowns and street vendors, clearing houses, partially organizing public works, preventing floods, and providing disaster relief and refugee relief. The work that has been carried out includes clearing 24,904 landmines in the urban and suburban areas, dismantling more than 18,000 bunkers, and accommodating 22,063 stray soldiers, including 2,739 officers. In terms of arresting special agents and bandits, in June and July, 289 people were arrested by the Public Security Bureau and 138 people were arrested by the Garrison Command, totaling 422 people, of which only 13 were sentenced to death. This shows that the People's Government focuses on educating and transforming ordinary special agents and criminals. In June, only 45% of the cases were solved, and in July, the number of cases solved reached 70%, proving that the ability of the people's police to solve cases has improved, gradually moving from unfamiliarity to familiarity. The special agent system of the Chiang bandit gang lurking in Shanghai is complex, but its internal system has mostly wavered, and many people have decided to repent and surrender to the People's Government. Thanks to the capable and hardworking staff and the assistance of street residents, it is impossible for special agents and bandits to attempt to retain their base in Shanghai. Summer epidemic prevention injections reached 3.5 million people, exceeding the historical record. A total of 35,000 tons of accumulated garbage in urban areas was cleared. In the past two months, 300,000 refugees have been assisted in evacuating and returning to their hometowns. In June, there were 259 traffic accidents, which had decreased to 182 in July, which is a decrease compared to the record of 330 traffic accidents in January and 286 in February during the Kuomintang rule. The reason for the decrease in traffic accidents is that the People's Government has adopted a restrictive policy on the use of automobiles, and has adopted organizational and educational policies for tricycle drivers. Citizens are also more able to abide by traffic rules, and the military has also strictly prevented illegal incidents of reckless driving; however, continued efforts are still needed in this regard. Recently, floods and typhoons have occurred in the suburbs and urban areas successively. The People's Government mobilized government agencies and military personnel to engage in rescue work, greatly reducing the losses of the people. For example, on the night of July 24, when a typhoon hit the city, 50,000 refugees fled into the urban area. The police stations and garrison troops immediately mobilized to accommodate them, providing food and shelter, and mobilizing residents, schools, and public institutions to assist, so that this group of disaster victims was quickly rescued and handled. Now, in the suburbs such as Baoshan and Pudong, it is still necessary to prevent the attack of autumn floods, and the government is organizing specialized agencies to prepare. Every task in Shanghai is very complicated and requires planned and persistent implementation from beginning to end. Therefore, we only require the various departments under the Municipal Government to do one or several of the most essential things well within a month, in addition to maintaining general business. This method is correct. When we first came, we were unfamiliar with the business and the situation was very unfamiliar. The good aspect of most of the old employees is that they cooperated with us and did not act arbitrarily; the bad aspect is that they did not understand our policies and adopted a hands-off attitude: "Let you try it in Shanghai." Thanks to the takeover personnel's humble consultation and selflessness, the help of conscious old employees, and the help of the people of Shanghai, our ability to handle affairs gradually improved, and we gradually became familiar with handling many complex problems. On the basis of the close connection between the People's Government and the people, the problems that the rulers of Shanghai in the past considered difficult and could not be solved can be solved. We will continue to move forward on the road of close contact with the people.
    (2) Financial and economic aspects: In this regard, our work is first to redeem the puppet gold yuan and US dollars, ban illegal activities of silver dollar dealers, regulate coal and grain, handle real value deposits, restore land and water transportation, repair railways, restore shipping, restore factory production, adjust taxes and prices of public utilities, conduct foreign trade and manage foreign exchange, and mediate labor-capital disputes. We are doing things according to Chairman Mao's instructions of "developing production, prospering the economy, benefiting both labor and capital, and taking into account both public and private interests." We allow self-provided foreign exchange, allow tax-free cotton imports, adopt a policy of encouraging and supporting ship imports, and adopt a policy of taking into account both state-owned and private enterprises in the allocation of stored cotton. The price increase of public utilities takes special care of the discounted electricity for manufacturers. These indicate that we are faithfully implementing the policy of taking into account both public and private interests and protecting all legitimate industries and businesses. We adopt a democratic consultation method to handle labor-capital disputes, and advise both parties to take care of the overall situation and overcome difficulties, so the rumors of some people maliciously predicting that the People's Government will severely oppress the capitalists after the liberation of Shanghai have been proven false. Our tax policy must take into account the government's expenses, first of all, military expenses, in order to support the front line of the People's Liberation War, and also take into account the people's ability to bear the burden. The rich should naturally bear more, but they should not exceed the limit of what they can bear. Here I want to point out that the old liberated areas bear much heavier burdens than the newly liberated areas, and the countryside bears much heavier burdens than the cities. This situation must be reasonably adjusted. We have made great efforts to regulate coal and grain. We have mobilized materials from five provinces in East China and other provinces outside East China to supply Shanghai, and answered the supply of various provinces by mobilizing and organizing Shanghai's industrial production capacity. Relying on this policy, plus the possible partial factory relocation methods, plus the assistance of the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries, and our policy of not refusing to conduct equal and mutually beneficial trade with other foreign businessmen, we are confident that the construction of Shanghai and the construction of the entire China can be gradually achieved self-reliance. The imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries attempted to destroy Shanghai by sea blockade and air bombardment, but the People's Liberation Army is rapidly liberating the entire China, and the enemy's attempt is bound to fail. It is estimated that the liberation of the entire country will take another year or slightly longer, and it will take about one to two years to adjust the relationship between urban and rural areas, exchange materials, restore transportation, and overcome disasters. It will take two or three years to overcome difficulties and enter the new track of people's construction. As long as we are courageous people, as long as we are people who dare to build a new China, all difficulties can be overcome.
    (3) Cultural and educational work: After taking over national colleges and universities and municipal primary and secondary schools, due to the current subjective and objective conditions, drastic reforms are generally rarely carried out. In higher education, we have not replaced personnel, but only used the school affairs committee to be responsible for school affairs, absorbing former parties involved in school affairs management. Regarding the education system, we have now only stopped the Kuomintang's moral education system and the party doctrine and civics courses. For church schools, we have only abolished the system of religion as a compulsory course. In terms of middle schools, only a very small number of resolutely reactionary principals have been replaced. In terms of literature and art, only two films and one drama with very reactionary content have been banned. With our sponsorship, the Federation of Teachers and Staff of Higher Education Institutions organized more than 2,000 teachers and staff, and the Federation of Teachers and Staff of Primary and Secondary Schools organized more than 8,000 teachers and staff. In the literary and art departments, various associations in the film industry, literary circles, poetry circles, music circles, and art circles have organized more than 8,000 literary and art workers. The Shanghai cultural circles sent more than 100 people to Beijing to participate in the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, the Preparatory Committee of the National Congress of Education Workers, and the Preparatory Committee of the National Congress of Science Workers. In terms of news and publishing, we have stopped the newspapers run by the Kuomintang reactionaries and the newspapers that used to be reactionary mouthpieces, published people's newspapers, reorganized two newspapers, and supported the resumption of publication of progressive newspapers that were suppressed during the Kuomintang era. These works represent a major policy, that is, to replace the Kuomintang reactionaries' anti-people and reactionary cultural and educational policies with the new democratic cultural and educational policies that serve the people. This policy must be implemented, but the steps to implement it must adopt the method of democratic persuasion, welcome progress and transformation, welcome those who have made mistakes in the past to correct their mistakes, admit their mistakes to the masses, break away from the Kuomintang reactionaries, and stand on the people's side to serve the people. This policy has won sympathy from all sides and has been effective in implementation. Naturally, it should be estimated that because the scope of our policy is very broad, it may give some bad elements who refuse to transform the opportunity to lie dormant, but we are not afraid, because the eyes of the people can shine on any dark corner. I would also like to point out that we have brought the various literary and educational work experiences and various artistic works of the old liberated areas and the People's Liberation Army in the cultural and educational aspects, providing friends in the literary and educational circles in Shanghai as a reference for seeking progress, and great achievements have been made in this regard. Whether in music, drama, painting, dance, or Peking opera, the works of the old liberated areas can appear in front of the people of Shanghai with a new attitude, arousing widespread praise. For example, the literary and art work troupe performed 70 times, with 1.64 million viewers. This shows that works of art that serve the people, despite their many shortcomings, their direction and content will surely be wholeheartedly loved by the people. This situation has moved all literary and art groups, so that they have begun to review their past work with new standards, so they have the possibility of bravely moving towards the people and serving the people.
    (4) In terms of foreign affairs: The Foreign Affairs Office was established under the Shanghai Military Control Commission, and worked in an orderly and successful manner in conjunction with the Foreign Affairs Management Section of the Public Security Bureau. Our basic principle on this issue is to protect all law-abiding foreigners in accordance with the provisions of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's Eight Points of Attention, and to punish foreigners who violate the laws and decrees of the People's Government. When punishing, lenient treatment can be given to those who are willing to repent. In the past two months, several incidents involving the handling of foreign illegal acts have occurred in Shanghai. We have all handled them fairly and leniently in accordance with the above-mentioned policy. Some imperialist schemers openly violate the facts witnessed by so many foreigners in Shanghai to accuse Shanghai of protecting foreign affairs work, attempting to create the impression that the Chinese people are "anti-foreign" to deceive their own people. I think this is futile. The punishment of some foreigners is because they do not abide by the laws and regulations. This punishment is deserved and is generally lenient. If the Military Control Commission and the People's Government are required to tolerate foreigners maintaining their past privileges on Chinese territory, then this is certainly impossible. The era when imperialists enjoyed privileges in China has gone with the collapse of the Kuomintang reactionaries. All those who hope to continue to maintain privileges in China must remember this. If they have a bad memory, it is necessary for us to remind them here.
    (5) In assisting the establishment of various people's revolutionary organizations: The organization of various people's revolutionary organizations is the cornerstone of new democratic politics. This kind of organization should be carried out based on the principle of people's conscious voluntariness. Since the liberation of Shanghai, workers, students, women, and cultural and educational circles have developed their organizations smoothly because they have an organizational foundation for underground struggles. Their mobilization to cooperate with the strength of the Military Control Commission and the People's Government is very strong, and the Military Control Commission and the People's Government have also given them some necessary assistance. They are carrying out in-depth education and expanding organization, and we wish them success. The Military Control Commission has ordered the dissolution and cessation of activities of various prominent pseudo-people's organizations during the Kuomintang era. For the remaining old social organizations, a prudent and gradual transformation policy is adopted, welcoming their internal spirit of democratic self-criticism to review their mass base and their long-standing political views, and selecting people who can truly work hard for the people's cause to do things. If it meets the organizational procedures of mass organizations during the military control period, the Military Control Commission and the People's Government will definitely support it. For example, the industrial circles in Shanghai have provided a lot of help to the Military Control Commission and the People's Government, and their own organization should begin.
    (6) Several experiences during the military control period: First, the takeover work is not simply administrative processing and technical processing, but the main political struggle task in the process of the people's revolutionary cause from winning victory to starting construction. Taking over the legacy left by the imperialist Kuomintang reactionaries, and taking over the accumulation of the people's blood and sweat over the years and the material foundation for the construction of the new democratic new China is of great significance to the construction of the new China. Therefore, Chairman Mao and our Party Central Committee attached great importance to the takeover work, calling on and leading Communist Party members, People's Government staff, and commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army to first abide by discipline and treat the takeover work with their own exemplary discipline. We did so. This ensures that the people's property seized back through war is returned to the people intact. The phenomenon of the so-called "Chongqing people" getting rich quickly in the Shanghai era of the Kuomintang's previous takeover is completely absent and not allowed here. What we have here is a revolutionary atmosphere of takeover personnel with discipline, order, no corruption, and selflessness. This is an event of great significance, it symbolizes the spirit of the new China's state staff serving the people wholeheartedly.
    Second, the takeover work policy does not adopt an acute method or a compromise method, but a steady and pragmatic takeover policy. This is a revolutionary realistic policy. This makes our takeover work able to grasp extremely complex situations and have the leeway to deal with various daily events. This makes the enemy's attempt to force us to change our policies by means of left-wing stimulation or right-wing temptation cannot but fail. In the first month after liberation, many friends thought we were too lenient, and special agents and bandits mistakenly thought we were weak and incompetent, but the development of things proved that the former's overestimation and the latter's illusion were not in line with the facts. Now some new situations have emerged, such as the temporary difficulties caused by the enemy's blockade, and some people have expressed pessimism. We dare to assert that in the near future, the people of Shanghai will gradually overcome difficulties and embark on a new and truly prosperous path. This fact will surely persuade all pessimistic and suspicious people.
    Third, the takeover work has enabled us to further understand the reality of the Kuomintang reactionaries' rule. From the takeover documents and materials, it was found that many materials transferred by the Japanese invaders three years ago and materials "aided China" by the United States in the past three years were sealed up without being cleaned up, allowing them to be sealed up and rot. The Kuomintang reactionaries' bureaucratic institutions can be said to be thoroughly corrupt. At the same time, we also saw the cunning of the Kuomintang reactionaries from the takeover work. They used various methods to hide materials and lie dormant; some even dared to impersonate the People's Liberation Army or underground workers to carry out "takeover" and quickly sell them; some absconded with funds or lay dormant in civilian homes, or coerced residents to impersonate them to keep them; or disguised themselves as democratic faces to impersonate democrats to cover up their materials; or colluded with foreigners to replace them to escape takeover. Therefore, the struggle methods of the takeover work are diverse, and various appropriate methods must be used to defeat the enemy. This struggle has not yet been completed and should continue to be implemented.
    Fourth, the use of democratic methods to mobilize the people to cooperate with the takeover in the takeover work has yielded unusually great results. All circles in Shanghai have provided great help to the takeover, especially hundreds of thousands of workers and students, who protected factories and schools before liberation and assisted in the takeover after liberation, going deep into the bottom of the enemy's rule and making greater contributions. We express our sincere gratitude.
    Fifth, in addition to the above-mentioned main good experiences, we should also point out that the takeover work has great shortcomings. For example, the situation is not familiar, the business knowledge is not enough, some problems are not handled quickly enough, the absorption of useful opinions is not broad enough, the cooperation between departments is not close enough, and individual personnel still have incidents of violating discipline. We must face these phenomena squarely, not defend these phenomena, but accept well-intentioned criticism and make effective corrections.
  IV. Work that the Military Control Commission and the People's Government Should Do in the Future
    (1) Comrade Rao Shushi has presented a political report on behalf of our Party on smashing the enemy's blockade and struggling for the construction of a new Shanghai. Regarding the content of this report, we had already considered and studied it in late June when the enemy began the blockade, and then conducted continuous discussions with various parties. After a month of deliberation, on July 27, the editorial was published in the Liberation Daily according to the spirit of this report, and the anti-feudal policy was put forward to all the people of Shanghai. Today, Comrade Rao Shushi has made a detailed explanation of this policy. We believe that the Shanghai Military Control Commission and the Shanghai People's Government should accept and implement this policy. The content of this policy includes six major items: First, actively support the front line and quickly liberate the entire China; Second, plan and step by step evacuate the population and implement the possible internal relocation of some schools and factories; Third, change Shanghai's production policy and development direction, get rid of dependence on imperialist economy, and determine to serve the Chinese people; Fourth, mobilize to go to the countryside to carry out rural work; Fifth, develop inland transportation and encourage the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas; Sixth, practice frugality and overcome difficulties. Should we adopt such a policy? Is there another better policy? Will adopting this policy make things worse? We have considered these kinds of questions, and we are afraid that we are not thorough enough, so we specifically mentioned it to the representative conference today for discussion. We hope that after the discussion and revision of the representative conference, the policy can be more perfect, the methods can be more thoughtful, and the implementation can be more effective. If anyone thinks that there can be another policy, we also welcome it as a counter-proposal for discussion, and then ask for a public decision. We hope to discuss and set a policy that everyone agrees on so that the future work of the Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government can follow it.
    (2) The Military Control Commission and the People's Government are willing to continue to help the rapid formal establishment of various people's revolutionary organizations so that the representative conference of all circles can expand its representation based on the various people's revolutionary organizations. The current representatives of the representative conference of all circles are appointed by the People's Government, and their task is to conduct consultation and negotiation, so it is necessary to expand and improve it. We ask the representatives of all circles to strengthen and attach importance to the work of the representative conference of all circles, give play to the power of democratic discussion and democratic mobilization, and assist the government in carrying out the takeover and construction work so that the current military management system can be gradually transitioned to the people's representative conference system, so that the people's democratic politics in Shanghai can be established more powerfully and soundly, which is what we hope.
    (3) Strengthen and improve the work capacity of government agencies so that they can adapt to the current revolutionary situation and the needs of the construction of the new China, and adapt to the needs of implementing the six major tasks, smashing the enemy's blockade, and building a new Shanghai. This requires strengthening the political discipline and life discipline of the government staff of the people's democratic country; strengthening the political education and business education of government personnel so that they can be competent to undertake the tasks of government work; promoting and building a democratic style, maintaining close contact with the people, and constantly fighting against possible bureaucracy and various bad habits.
    The above is the work report I presented to the conference on behalf of the Shanghai Military Control Commission and the Shanghai People's Government. Please inspect and correct the representatives.

    【新华社上海十二日电】本月三日，上海市军管会主任兼上海市人民政府市长陈毅，在上海各界代表会议上，作了“上海市军管会和人民政府六七两月的工作报告”，这个报告已为代表会议所一致同意。兹志其全文如下：诸位代表同志们、先生们：
    上海市于本年五月二十七日完全解放，已经两个多月了。我代表上海市军事管制委员会和上海市人民政府，把两个月来的工作，向各位代表作一简要的报告。我想说明的是：一、解放上海的经过；二、两月来的接收工作；三、在军管时期的具体工作；四、军管会和市政府今后应做的工作。各位代表听了我这个报告后，请对军管会和市政府的工作加以指正。
  一、解放上海的经过
    人民解放军于四月二十一日横渡长江，二十三日解放南京，五月三日解放杭州，此后即开始部署解放上海的战斗。五月十二日起开始上海外围的战斗，五月二十四日我东西两兵团钳击吴淞要塞，封锁了吴淞港口，完全断了敌军的退路。五月二十五日开始四面总攻，二十七日上海完全解放。此役计歼灭敌军二十三万人，内生俘和投降的十五万人。伪上海市政府的首要已先期逃走，由代市长赵祖康先生率领市府人员高悬白旗，向人民解放军举行光荣的投诚。这种方式是有利于人民的。这个情形，证明了蒋介石匪帮的众叛亲离，以至不能带去其政府人员；又证明了毛主席朱总司令的约法八章，已经深入人心。由于旧市府大多数人员的尽职，从上海旧租界工部局时代起经过日寇直至国民党时代的文件档案和公用器材，完整地转交于人民之手。这种方式可能而且必然会发展到西北、西南、华南各省，包括台湾在内。解放上海的战斗是经过血战和克服困难才取得的。在解放上海的战斗中，人民解放军指战员的英勇艰苦，值得称述。从千里以外赶来解放上海的部队，冒着梅雨，只用十天的急行军就赶到了。因为机枪、迫击炮、步兵炮、山炮等武器和大批弹药无法驮载，完全改用步兵人力扛运，克服千多里的道路泥泞，很不容易。此外，我军从营级干部起至兵团司令，因渡江追击敌军，骡马无法先行随军渡江，一月来完全和士兵一样步行驰抵上海近郊，也是难能可贵的。蒋匪对上海的防御曾经经过长期的准备，利用上海近代建筑和工业设备作了外围阵地、主阵地、核心阵地三种部署。蒋匪的防御工事，包括钢骨水泥碉堡五千座，美式水泥活动碉堡三千座，卫星工事半永久性野战掩体万余处。每一个碉堡又布置了三道至九道副防御不等。人民解放军不得不以血战来逐一夺取这些保垒。蒋匪曾经乱吹什么上海的设防较之“斯大林格勒的防御还强百分之三十三”，什么“防守六个月至一年来挽救战局，反守为攻”，并且采用了搬运、破坏、抢劫、勒索的手段，企图破坏上海。但是由于人民解放军进攻的迅速，作战的英勇，和上海人民护厂护校的积极，使上海的破坏仍然比较少。这里的主要的教训就是：依靠中国共产党的领导，依靠中国人民的劳动与智慧，必能克服一切困难，战胜一切敌人。解放上海是走这条路，建设上海必然仍走这条路。在上海解放后，由于被敌人封锁发生困难，有少数人就动摇起来，表示悲观、迟疑甚至抱怨。我在这里提出经过与敌人恶斗而解放上海的教训，是有益处的。难道要建设一个新上海，不经过克服更大的困难是能够成功的吗？
    二、二月来的接收工作
    我们部署渡江解放京沪时，即已着手接管上海的准备工作，成立各种专门委员会从事专门研究，向懂得上海情况的人询问并征求对于接管的意见。我们知道要接收和管理象上海这样一个大城市，必须以虚心学习的态度来对待接管工作。我们分四大部门进行接收：一、政务部门，二、军事部门，三、财经部门，四、文教部门。我们把国民党伪中央的机构与伪上海市政府的机构统一划分在上述四大部门内去统一接收。伪市政部门于军管时期逐渐归还人民政府管辖。各不属于市政范围的中央事业及各省市的事业，目前由军管会代接代管，准备将来归还中央及各省市。
    我们把整个接管工作分成接收、管理、改造三大步骤。接收工作一般包括移交清点接收，主要求得不打乱；不影响军管时期工作与业务的继续。在此阶段，国民党反动制度的遗迹暂时存留很多，变化不大。在管理阶段，主要是进行研究和考察，开始局部的改造和整编。国民党反革命制度的遗迹开始清除，人民民主制度开始建立。在改造阶段，则着重全盘地或大部地肃清国民党的反动制度，巩固地建立人民民主的新政权制度。政务部门和军事部门按照解放区的优良的军政制度，进行全盘的彻底改造；经济部门与文化部门则保留其符合人民利益与符合科学规律的部分，改变其反人民利益与反科学规律的部分。整个地说，经济产业部门与文化部门会比政务部门与军事部门变更较小。但这只是就技术范围说的。经济产业文化诸部门的基本方针，则仍然与政治军事部门相同，就是必须用为人民服务的方针，来代替国民党反动派的反人民的反动方针。
    （一）市政接管工作：计接管财政、卫生、工务、公用、教育、地政、民政、警察、社会等九个局，另一民食调配处，和文献委员会。市府本部计接管调查、人事、秘书、会计、新闻、外事、总务、交际等十个处，共计旧人员职工计四万九千余人。除调查处人事处旧职员大部逃跑或转入潜伏外，其余各局处百分之九十五以上留在原职位照常工作，听候处理和录用。我们将伪社会局裁撤，另成立工商管理处和劳工局。将民食调配处裁撤，另成立上海粮食公司，管理粮食供应。另成立房产管理处，管理房产的清理和调配。另成立外侨事务处，管理侨务工作，由该处接收伪中央政府驻沪外事机关及其他有关机构。
    （二）财经接管工作：这一项计接收属于伪国民党市政府及属于伪中央政府的银行、工厂、仓库等机构共四百一十一个单位，重要资财计黄金二万四千六百两，白银三十六万元，伪金圆券二十一万亿，伪台币两亿四千万，台糖三万五千吨，粮食四十七万石，新旧好坏不等的汽车一万八千辆，汽油四千八百八十七万加仑。在上述各机关服务的旧职员工共计十五万三千余名。
    （三）文化接管工作：计高等教育方面接管大专校院二十六个单位，包括教授讲师助教研究员及职员工人共二千七百九十六人，学生共八千一百零九人。市政教育方面接管公立学校及教育机关共五百零三个单位，教职员工共五千五百一十七人，学生十七万六千四百一十八人。新闻出版方面接管和实行军管的共五十二个单位，其中报馆通讯社二十五个单位，书店印刷厂等三十个单位，广播台及器材厂三个单位，上述各单位的人员共二千三百一十四人。文艺方面共接管十三个单位，其中电影九个单位，戏院四个，共员工一百七十三人，技术人员一百六十五人。各私立大中小学未予接收亦尚未实施军管，俟国立教育事业处理就绪再筹商处理办法。
    （四）军事接管工作：在接管部署上分为训练、政工、后勤、空军、海军五部。对敌之陆军是以战场歼灭代替了接收，剩下的任务是打扫战场和处理俘虏。陆军营房计三十八处，均大部破坏，初步修理据专家估计需二百亿人民币，为节省开支暂停修理，另由人民解放军指战员组织勤务劳动，作临时补修工作。训练部只接收几个军事学校，完全是破坏了的空房子。政工部门只接收两个伪政工队，一所印刷厂，十七个广播电台，另三十个单位，内分戏剧、电影、乐队等，均小型机构，一律分散编入人民解放军改造后参加服务。上述两部门接收工作结束最快。后勤部接管单位共一百一十六个，被接管人员计工人七千七百四十八名，职员一千三百九十三名，学员五十二名，技师二百二十七名，医工人员二千五百九十九名，政工人员一百零三名，伤病员九千五百七十四名，将级官员三名，校尉级官员三百九十二名，士兵七千六百九十七名，杂务人员五百一十五名，家属二千九百五十四名，其他人员一千四百四十名，总计三万四千六百九十七名。后勤部所接收之各单位，系敌军联勤系统之补给、修械、被服、医务等业务机构。空军接收部共接收十二个单位，接收空军人员一千二百二十名，民航人员一千四百五十五人，空军航空工程师技师计四十名。空军较陆军保全较多，民用航空方面保全更多。另接收空军及民航房屋三千三百四十九间；其中可用房屋一千八百三十四间。海军接收部共接收十八个单位，仓库十四个，工人八十二名，技术人员一百五十四名，职员五十八名，杂役八十名。海军破坏较空军为大，几乎没有一个完整的机构。
    由于我们接管方针的正确，接管人员的努力，以及上海人民的同情援助，两个月来的接管工作是胜利地完成了初步接管的任务。现在接管工作应转入第二阶段的管理和局部改造的阶段。
  三、军管时期的具体工作
    （一）市政方面：我们先后进行了肃清残敌，扫除战争痕迹，恢复市区秩序，维持治安，恢复交通秩序，扫除垃圾，进行防疫注射，疏散和救济难民，清理棚户摊贩，清理房屋，局部地整理工务，防水救灾和救济难民等项工作。已经进行的工作，包括扫除市区近郊地雷计二万四千九百零四个，拆除碉堡一万八千余座，收容散兵游勇二万二千零六十三人，内军官二千七百三十九人。在逮捕特务盗匪方面，在六七两个月内，计由公安局逮捕者二百八十九人，由警备司令部逮捕者一百三十八人，两共四百二十二人，其中判处死刑者只十三人。这里表示人民政府对普通特务分子和罪犯是着重教育改造的。六月份破案仅百分之四十五，七月份破案即达百分之七十，证明人民警察破案的能力是提高了，由不熟悉逐渐走向熟悉了。蒋匪帮潜伏上海市的特务系统复杂，但其内部多已动摇，并有不少人已决心悔改，向人民政府输诚。由于我方人员干练努力，并有市街居民协助，特务匪徒企图在上海保留其根据地是不可能的。夏季防疫注射达三百五十万人，超过历来的纪录。清除市区积存垃圾计三万五千吨。两个月来资助疏散难民返乡计三十万人。六月份车辆肇事达二百五十九件，七月份已减至一百八十二件，比较国民党统治时代一月份车辆肇事三百三十件，二月份二百八十六件的纪录是减少了。车祸减少的原因是人民政府对汽车使用采取限制政策，对三轮车夫采取组织和教育政策，市民也比较能遵守交通规则，军队方面也严格制止横冲直撞的违警事件；但是在这一方面还需要继续努力。最近近郊和市区相继发生水灾和台灾，人民政府动员了政府机关和军队人员从事抢救，大大地减少了人民的损失。例如七月二十四日夜台风袭击本市，当夜五万余难民纷纷逃入市区，当即由各警局驻军动员收容，供给住食，动员居民学校公共机关协助，使这一批灾民迅速得到救济和处理。现在近郊如宝山浦东等地，仍要防止秋汛的袭击，政府正组织专门机关进行准备中。上海每一件工作都很复杂，都需要从头到尾有计划地坚持进行。因此我们对市政所属各部，除一般维持业务外，只要求他们在一个月内做好最切要的一件事和几件事，这个方法是正确的。我们初来，业务不熟悉，情况很生疏。多数旧职员们好的方面，是和我们合作，不擅专；坏的方面是由于不明了我们的政策，采取了袖手旁观的态度：“让你们在上海试试看吧。”由于接管人员的虚心请教，克己奉公，取得了有觉悟的旧职员的帮助，取得了上海人民的帮助，我们的办事能力逐步提高，对许多复杂问题处理起来也逐渐顺手了。在人民政府与人民密切联系的基础之上，便能使历代的上海统治者认为繁难而不能解决的问题开始解决，我们将遵循与人民密切联系的道路继续前进。
    （二）财政经济方面：在这方面我们的工作首先是收兑伪金圆券与美钞，取缔银元贩违法活动，调剂煤粮，办理折实存款，恢复水陆交通，修复铁路，恢复航运，恢复工厂的生产，调整税收和公用事业的价格，进行对外贸易和管理外汇，调解劳资纠纷等。我们是按毛主席的“发展生产，繁荣经济，劳资两利，公私兼顾”的指示去办事的。我们准许自备外汇，允许棉花进口免税，对船舶进口采取鼓励扶助的方针，对存棉分配采取国营私营兼顾的方针，公用事业加价特别照顾厂商用电的折价。这些说明我们是忠实地执行了公私兼顾和保护一切正当工商业的政策。我们处理劳资纠纷采用民主协商方式，劝告双方照顾大局克服困难，因而使某些人恶意地预言上海解放后人民政府将要严厉压迫资方的造谣落了空。我们的税收政策既要照顾政府的开支，首先是军费开支，借以支援人民解放战争的前线，同时又要照顾人民负担能力。殷富者自然应该多负担一些，但也不能超过其可能负担的限度。这里我要指出，老解放区比新解放区负担重得多，而乡村又比城市负担重得多，对这种情况必须加以合理的调整。对于调剂煤粮，我们是作了极大的努力。我们调动华东五个省和华东以外各省的物资来供应上海，并以动员和组织上海的工业生产力来回答各省的供应。依靠这个方针，加上可能的部分的迁厂办法，加上苏联和各新民主国家的帮助，以及我们不拒绝与其他外商进行平等互利贸易的政策，我们深信上海的建设和全中国的建设，是一定可以逐步达到自力更生的。帝国主义和国民党反动派企图以海上封锁和空中轰炸来毁灭上海市，但是人民解放军正在迅速地解放全中国，敌人的企图是一定要失败的。估计解放全国还要一年或稍长的时间，而调整城乡关系，交流物资，恢复交通，克服灾荒则约需一年到二年。两三年时间即可克服困难，走入人民建设的新轨道。只要我们是有勇气的人，只要我们是敢于建设新中国的人，什么困难都是可以克服的。
    （三）文教工作方面：对国立大专校院及市立各中小学校接收后，由于目前主观和客观的条件，一般地很少进行剧烈的改革。在高等教育方面，我们没有撤换人员，只改用校务委员会来负责校务，吸收旧当事人参加校务管理。对于教育制度，现在只停止了国民党的训育制度，停止了党义与公民课程。对教会学校，只取消了宗教作为必修课的制度。中学方面，只撤换了极少数坚决反动的校长。文艺方面，只禁演了内容很反动的两种影片和一种戏剧。在我们的赞助之下，高等学校教职员联合会组织了教职员共二千余人，中小学教职员联合会，组织了教职员八千余人。文艺部门在电影界、文学界、诗歌界、音乐界、美术界的各种协会中共组织了文艺工作者八千余人。上海的文化界派出了百余人去北平参加全国文学艺术工作者代表大会，全国教育工作者代表大会筹备会和全国科学工作者代表大会筹备会。新闻出版方面，我们停止了国民党反动派办的报纸和过去作为反动喉舌的报纸，刊行了人民的报纸，实行了两家报纸的改组，扶助了过去在国民党时代受压迫而停刊的进步报纸的复刊。这些工作表现了一个主要方针，即以新民主主义的为人民服务的文教方针来代替国民党反动派反人民的反动文教方针。这个方针必须贯彻，但贯彻的步骤则须采用民主说服的方法，欢迎进步和改造，欢迎过去犯过错误的人改过自新，向群众认错，脱离国民党反动派，站到人民立场上为人民服务。这个方针获得各方面的同情，在实施中收了效果。自然应当估计到，由于我们政策的范围很宽大，可能给某些拒绝改造的坏分子以潜伏活动的机会，但我们不害怕，因为人民的眼睛是可以照遍任何阴暗的角落的。我还要指出，我们在文教方面带来老解放区和人民解放军的各种文艺教育工作经验和各种艺术作品，提供上海市的文艺教育界朋友作为求进步的参考，在这方面成就很大。无论在音乐、戏剧、绘画、舞蹈、平剧各方面，老解放区的作品都能以崭新的姿态出现在上海人民的面前，引起广泛的赞誉。例如文艺工作团演出七十次，观众达一百六十四万人。这说明为人民服务的艺术作品，尽管它本身依然有许多缺点，但它的方向和内容必能获得人民的衷心爱护。这种情形，感动了各派文艺集团，使他们开始以新的标准检讨自己过去的工作，因而他们就有了勇敢地走向人民，为人民服务的可能性。
    （四）在外侨事务方面：在上海市军管会下面成立了外侨事务所，协同公安局外侨管理科，工作得很有秩序很有成绩。我们在这个问题上的基本原则，是按照毛主席朱总司令约法八章的规定，凡守法的外侨定予保护，违反人民政府法令的外侨定予处分，在处分时对愿意悔改的又可酌情作宽大的处理。两个月来，在上海市接连发生了若干次关于处理外侨违法的事件，我们都本着上述方针，作了公平宽大的处理。某些帝国主义野心家公然违背上海如此众多的外侨所目睹的事实，来指责上海市的保护外侨工作，企图造成中国人民“排外”的印象，来愚弄其本国人民，我想这是徒然的。若干外侨的受处分，是由于他们不遵守法令，这种处分是应得的，并且一般地是宽大的。如果要求军管会和人民政府容忍外侨在中国领土上保持其以往的特权，那么这当然办不到。帝国主义者在中国享受特权的时代，已随国民党反动派的垮台而一去不复返了。凡是希望继续在中国保持特权的人们必须记住这一点，如果他们记性不好，我们在这里提醒一句，是有必要的。
    （五）在协助各人民革命团体的建立方面：各人民革命团体的组织是新民主主义政治的基石。这种组织，应根据于人民自觉自愿的原则去进行。在上海市解放以来，工人、学生、妇女、和文化教育界，因为他们有地下斗争的组织基础，他们的组织很顺利地发展了起来。他们动员起来配合军管会和人民政府的力量非常之大，军管会和人民政府也给了他们一些必要的帮助。他们正进行深入教育和扩大组织的工作，我们预祝他们的成功。对于国民党时代各种显著的伪人民团体，军管会已令其解散并停止活动。对于其余的旧有的社会团体，则采取审慎的逐步改造的方针，欢迎他们的内部能以民主的自我批评的精神，检讨自己的群众基础和他们历来的政治主张，选择真正能为人民事业努力的人出来办事，如果合乎军管时期群众团体的组织程序，则军管会和人民政府是定予赞助的。举例来说，上海市的产业界，对军管会和人民政府有不少的帮助，他们本身的组织是应该开始了。
    （六）军管时期的几点经验：第一、接管工作不单纯是行政处理和技术处理，而是人民革命事业从获得胜利到开始建设的过程中主要的政治斗争任务。好好地接管帝国主义国民党反动派遗留下来的遗产，好好地接管这些人民多年来血汗的积累和新民主主义新中国建设的物质基础，这对新中国的建设有重大的意义。因此，毛主席和我党中央非常重视接管工作，号召并领导共产党员，人民政府工作人员，人民解放军的指战员，首先遵守纪律，以自己的模范纪律来对待接管工作。我们是这样做了。这就保证了用战争夺回的人民财产，原封不动地交还人民。象国民党以前接管上海时代所谓“重庆人”的五子登科的现象，在我们这里是完全没有和不允许的。我们这里有的是接管人员有纪律、有秩序、不贪污、克己奉公的革命气象。这是一件有重大意义的事件，它象征着新中国的国家工作人员澈头澈尾地为人民服务的精神。
    第二、接管工作方针，既不采取急性办法，也不采取迁就办法，而是采取稳步前进的实事求是的接管方针。这是一种革命现实主义的方针。这使得我们的接管工作能掌握极复杂的情况，能有余裕去处理各种日常事变。这就使得敌人方面以左的刺激方法或右的引诱方法来逼迫我们改变方针的企图，不能不归于失败。解放后第一个月有许多朋友嫌我们太宽大，而特务匪徒则误认为我们软弱无能，但是事情的发展证明了前者的过虑和后者的错觉都不合于事实。现在又出现一些新的情况，例如对敌人封锁而引起的暂时困难，某些人表示悲观。我们敢断定，在不远的将来，上海人民即将逐步克服困难而走上新的真正繁荣。这个事实，必能说服一切悲观怀疑的人们。
    第三、接管工作中使我们更深入了解了国民党反动派统治的实际。从接管文件物资当中，发现有许多三年前日寇移交的物资和三年来美国“援华”的物资，原封未动，不加清理，任其封存腐烂。国民党反动派官僚机构，可以说是腐朽透了。同时我们还从接管工作中看到了国民党反动派的狡猾。他们用各种方法隐藏物资，潜伏物资；有的竟敢冒充人民解放军或地下工作者的名义，进行“接管”，迅速变卖；有的卷款潜逃或潜伏民家，或胁迫居民冒名替他们保管；或化装民主面貌冒充民主人士，来掩护其物资；或勾结外侨顶替，来逃避接管等。因此接管工作的斗争方式是多样性的，必须运用各种适当的方法去战胜敌人。这一斗争现在还未完成，应当继续贯彻下去。
    第四、在接管工作中用民主方法动员人民配合接管，所收效果异常之大。上海各界对接管帮助很大，尤其数十万工人学生，解放前护厂护校，解放后协助接管，深入到敌方统治的底层，贡献更大。我们深致感谢。
    第五、除上述的主要的好经验以外，我们还应指出接管工作是有很大的缺点的。例如情况不熟，业务知识不够，某些问题处理不够迅速，吸收有益意见不够广泛，各部门配合不够密切，个别人员破坏纪律的事仍有发生等。我们要正视这些现象，不替这些现象辩护，而要接受善意的批评，加以有效的纠正。
  四、军管会和人民政府今后应做的工作
    （一）饶漱石同志已代表我党提出了粉碎敌人封锁为建设新上海而斗争的政治报告。关于这个报告的内容，早在六月下旬当敌人开始封锁时，我们即已进行考虑和研究，然后又与各方面进行了不断的讨论。经过一个月的酝酿，才在七月二十七日根据这个报告的精神在解放日报发表社论，向全上海人民提出反封建的方针。今天饶漱石同志对于这个方针又作了详细说明。我们认为，上海市军管会和人民政府应该接受和执行这个方针。这个方针的内容包括六大项：即一、积极支援前线迅速解放全中国；二、有计划有步骤地疏散人口和实行部分学校工厂的可能的内迁；三、改变上海生产方针与发展方向，摆脱对帝国主义经济的依赖，而确定为替中国人民服务；四、动员到农村去开展农村工作；五、发展内地交通，鼓励城乡物资交流；六、实行节衣缩食克服困难。究竟应不应该采取这样的方针呢？是否还有另外更好的方针呢？采取这个方针是不是会把事情弄坏呢？属于这一类的问题，我们都曾经考虑过，恐怕不周到，所以今天特意提到各界代表会上来讨论。我们盼望经过各界代表会的讨论和修正，能使方针更完善，办法更周到，实行更有效。如有人认为可以有另外的方针，我们亦欢迎作为对案提出讨论，再讨诸公决。我们希望经过讨论定出大家同意的方针，使今后军管会和市政府的工作有所遵循。
    （二）军管会和人民政府愿意继续帮助各人民革命团体的迅速正式建立，使各界代表会议能以各人民革命团体为基础，扩大其代表性。目前的各界代表会的代表是人民政府聘任的，其任务是进行咨询和协商，因此还需要加以扩大和提高。我们请各界代表加强并重视各界代表会议的工作，发挥民主讨论和民主动员的力量，来协助政府进行接管和建设工作，以便逐步地由目前的军事管理的制度，过渡到人民代表会议的制度，使上海市的人民民主政治更强有力地更健全地建立起来，这是我们所盼望的。
    （三）加强和提高政府机关的工作能力，使之能适应目前革命形势和新中国建设的需要，适应执行六大任务、粉碎敌人封锁和建设新上海的需要。这就要加强人民民主国家的政府工作人员的政治纪律和生活纪律；就要加强政府人员的政治教育和业务教育，使其能胜任担负政府工作的任务；就要提倡和建设民主作风，与人民保持密切联系，与可能发生的官僚主义和各种坏习气作经常的斗争。
    以上就是我代表上海市军管会和上海市人民政府对大会提出的工作报告，请各位代表加以检查和指正。
