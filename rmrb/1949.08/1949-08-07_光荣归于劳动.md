    Glory to Labor
    By V. Yiadanski
    (Continued from last issue)

    Youths in other parts of the country did not lag behind either, automatically responding to the call of these advanced workers. In another city, ten workers from the Stalin factory suggested a tit-for-tat plan, shortening the time required for a given task by twelve percent. Sisca Liba's shock worker Nadislav Mahas reduced the required time for another job by half, and the names of the best coal miners, shock team leader Boruski and Boruski, also appeared in the newspapers.

    These shock workers prepared to commemorate the Ninth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, which was to be held at the end of May, with new achievements. On February 11th, 12,000 representatives of the Communist Party organs in Prague and the province gathered at the Industrial Palace in the capital. They calculated the tasks of 159 factories and declared that they could save 362,000,000 crowns by increasing production as a gift for the congress.

    The next day, the Gottwald steel factory in Vitkovice wrote a letter to the President of the Republic, stating that in order to welcome the Ninth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the factory's workers, engineers, and staff solemnly guaranteed to exceed their production plan and strive to save 20,479,866 crowns.

    The Busen Skoda factory also congratulated the Ninth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party with their guarantee. They guaranteed a total savings of 400,000,000 crowns.

    The shock movement swept the country. But it would be wrong to think that everything was going smoothly, and that the train on the billboard was advancing towards its destination without encountering any difficulties or obstacles along the way. The remnants of the old forces are still very tenacious, and many adult, skilled workers are not interested in the ideals of these young shock teams.

    "You're so busy... be careful not to break your necks, you hurried ghosts!" They angrily said to the workers who first engaged in shock work.

    Old workers ridiculed the activists among them who worked with all their might to exceed the production plan. Some workers were also furious when they heard that those tired and lazy ghosts—who had become accustomed to forced labor under the capitalist system—were being mobilized to work hard.

    When enterprises were in the hands of capitalists, hard work was of no benefit to workers because only the owners of the enterprises profited. During the German occupation, "dragging one's feet" became a method of fighting and resisting the enemy. When the people seized power and became the masters of industry and the entire economy, this situation fundamentally changed. But not all workers immediately realized that they were working for themselves and for their country. Moreover, it should not be forgotten that reactionaries are taking advantage of every opportunity to seize on the more backward or less class-conscious sections of the people to hinder the progress of the country. These reactionaries directly encourage workers to engage in sabotage.

    Overtime work was once considered the most difficult problem to solve. The plan based on fully utilizing all working hours would be difficult to complete under the eight-hour working system if there were absenteeism, wasted time, or some people being slack and lazy at work. But the plan must be completed! Therefore, overtime work became a lucky opportunity for those who sought to make money easily. It suffices to point out that in the nine months of 1948, a total of 115,000,000 hours of overtime were spent in industry, greatly increasing production costs.

    The shock workers' efforts to strengthen labor discipline and increase labor productivity dealt a fatal blow to the conspirators who were hostile to the people's cause. The shock work movement is a huge progressive factor in industry. The shock workers abandoned the capitalist method of not allowing production secrets to be shared by other colleagues, and the experience of all advanced workers became the wealth of the masses.

    It is not difficult to understand the difficulties encountered by the shock teams who first started working with new working methods. These are the difficulties encountered when new things overcome old ideas and habits and open up a path for themselves. In this regard, the role of the trade union as an organizing and guiding force is particularly important. However, there were also many shortcomings in the early stages of trade union work. Their formalistic and bureaucratic attitude towards the shock work movement has recently been criticized by the Czech Truth newspaper.

    All developing difficulties can and must be overcome and eliminated in a timely manner. To achieve this goal, the wage system must be adjusted so that each worker's wage truly corresponds to the individual's knowledge, skills, and level of effort. For example, in state organs, salaries are often determined based on rank and years of service. This antiquated and conservative system hinders the development of young forces. Another issue is how best to mobilize all engineering personnel to participate in the shock team movement and how to materially encourage the working people in all industries to improve production levels.

    This democratic republic is gradually solving these and similar problems. Last February, the working class won a decisive political victory over the reactionary forces, and will undoubtedly be able to consolidate this victory economically.

    However, the young people's democratic republic still encountered difficulties of another nature.

    The reactionary factions, which were completely defeated in February 1948, went into "underground" hiding. These reactionaries put on masks. But there is no doubt that they have not given up their counter-revolutionary conspiracies. Although the leaders of the reactionary factions have been completely abandoned by the people and fled abroad, the land that nurtured misfortune still exists. Although capitalists have decreased, they still exist in the Czech Republic.

    Reactionaries dream of relying on imperialist armed intervention, and foreign intelligence agencies are plotting sabotage and strikes.

    The reactionary path of conspiring against the will of the broad masses of the people in February 1948 has clearly shown that it is an underground organization, closely linked to foreign countries, espionage, sabotage and trial.

    This entire exhibition of typical behavior was later held in the Prague court. That was the interrogation of Mletzek, Professor Duma and his group of saboteurs - a terrorist group of students.

    The army and public security forces began to serve the people. Young workers have full opportunities to be promoted to cadres and hold important positions.

    Reviews and studies were repeatedly carried out in all national political and economic institutions.

    No matter how the enemies of democracy clamor for their despicable underground activities, the people of Czechoslovakia are still calmly and confidently advancing along the socialist path they have chosen.

    "The Five-Year Plan is the Road to Socialism" - this is the most popular slogan in Czechoslovakia today. And the success of this plan depends on labor, striving for it, and is an intense and tenacious struggle.

    We visited a small Ervillnis mining town. This mine is named after Jan Stwoma, a Czech national hero (who died in the war). Its miners are consoling the 78th Infantry Battalion named after this hero. The municipal authorities and their guests—soldiers, commanders, and representatives from other towns, including Vhadis, Jan Stwoma's hometown—all gave enthusiastic speeches, elaborating on the only view: a country that has cleared away the dregs of capitalists and eliminated the dross and traitors of society from the path of development, a country of the working class led by the battle-tested Communist Party cannot be defeated.

    Along with the effort to implement the Five-Year Plan is the development of a new socialist spirit in the people. The Czech people have never had such a strong pursuit of knowledge and love of literature and art as they do today. Dozens of young men and women from proletarian and peasant backgrounds are already studying in new preparatory courses for workers to attend universities or vocational schools in the future. Higher education, which was once an unaffordable luxury for them, is now preparing them to be experts and working-class intellectuals.

    In the past three years, more than 200,000 copies of the Concise Course on the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have been published. Tens of thousands of copies of the works of Lenin and Stalin have been printed and immediately sold out. Marxist-Leninist literature is really in short supply. The sales of Communist Party publications are constantly increasing.

    The publishing industry is taking appropriate steps to rectify it. The National Assembly is considering a plan for the publication and distribution of books.

    Factories, workshops, and farms that are about to start spring plowing are all fighting for the Five-Year Plan. There is also such an unremitting struggle on the cultural front.………(Translated by Wang Gengsheng, excerpted from New Era, No. 10, 1949)

    光荣归于劳动
    Ｖ·依阿但斯基著
    （续完）
    这个国家别的地方的青年也不曾落后，自动地响应了这些先进工人底号召。在另外一个城市里，斯大林工厂底十个工人，建议了一个针锋相对的计划，缩短了既定工作所需时间的百分之十二。锡斯卡·立巴的一个突击工人纳地斯拉夫·马哈斯在另外一个工作上减少了所需时间的一半，还有最好的煤矿工人突击队队长波如斯基和波鲁斯基的名字也在报纸上出现了。
    这些突击工人准备以新的成就纪念将于五月底召开的捷共第九次代表大会。在二月十一日，布拉格城和全省的共产党机关底一万二千个代表在首都工业宫集会，他们计算一百五十九个工厂的任务，宣称只用提高生产的办法便可节省三六二、○○○、○○○克隆，作为这次大会的献礼。
    第二天，维特柯维斯地方的哥特瓦尔德钢铁工厂写给共和国总统一封信说，为了迎接捷共第九次大会，该厂工人、工程师、职员，郑重地保证超过他们的生产计划，并努力节省二○、四七九、八六六克隆。
    布森地·斯可达工厂也以他们的保证来祝贺捷共第九次大会。他们担保节约的总数共计四○○、○○○、○○○克隆。
    突击运动风靡全国。但是如果以为一切进行的非常顺利，牌告上的火车在途中不曾遭受任何困难和阻碍地向着目标前进，那就错了。旧的残余势力仍然是很顽强的，许多成年的、熟练的工人对于这些青年突击队的理想，不感兴趣。
    “你们这么忙乱……当心不要扭断了你们的脖子，慌忙鬼”！他们对首先搞突击的工人生气地说。
    老工人嘲骂他们之中用尽气力工作以求超过生产计划的积极分子。也有工人听说要动员那些疲塌和懒惰鬼——这些人已习惯于资本主义制度下的强制劳动——卖劲干活时，就勃然大怒了。
    当企业握在资本家手里时，因为只有企业主获得利润，努力工作对工人并无利益。在德国占领期间，“磨洋工”变成了和敌人斗争及抵抗敌人的方法。当人民掌握了政权并成了工业和整个经济底主人时，这种情况便从根本上改变过来了。但不是所有一切的工人马上都认识到他们是为自己工作，为自己的国家工作。而且还不应当忘记反动派正利用每一个机会抓住较落后的、或阶级觉悟低的一部分人来阻碍国家的进步。这些反动分子直接鼓励工人从事怠工。
    加班工作曾经认为是最难解决的问题。根基充分应用全部工作时间所订的计划，假如有旷工，浪费时间，或一部分人在工作时松懈散漫等情形，那么就很难在八小时工作制下完成。但是计划是非完成不可的！因此加班工作就变成了这些企求赚钱容易的人们的幸运了。这只要指出在一九四八年九个月中用于工业上的加班时间共达一一五、○○○、○○○小时，大大地增加了生产成本这一点就够了。
    突击工人努力加强劳动纪律，提高劳动生产率给与了敌视人民事业的阴谋家以致命的打击。突击工作运动是工业上极大的进步因素。突击工人抛弃资本主义的不让生产秘密被其他同业一同享有的方法，所有先进工人的经验变成了群众的财富。
    首先以新的工作方法开始工作的突击队所遭遇的困难是不难理解的。这是当新事物克服旧的思想、习惯、为自己开拓出一条道路时所遭遇到的困难。在这方面，作为组织和指导力量的工会所起的作用是特别重要的。但是，工会工作初期的缺点也是不少的。它们对于突击工作运动的形式主义和官僚主义态度，近来曾受到捷克真理报的批评。
    所有发展中的困难，一定能够及时克服和排除的。为了达到这个目的，必须调整工资制度，使每个工人的工资真正符合于各个人的知识、技能和努力的程度。例如在国家机关中，常常依据等级和工作年限来订定薪资，这个陈腐的、保守的度制，阻碍了青年力量的发展。另外一个问题，是如何最好地动员所有工程人员参加突击队运动，以及如何在物质上鼓励一切行业的劳动人民提高生产水平。
    这个民主共和国正逐渐解决这些及其类似问题。去年二月工人阶级曾经在政治上获得了对于反动势力的决定性的胜利，无疑地也一定能够在经济上巩固这个胜利。
    但是，青年的人民民主共和国仍然遇到了另外性质的困难。
    一九四八年二月被完全打垮了的反动派，却隐没到“地下”去了。这些反动派戴上了假面具。但是毫无疑义的，他们并没有放弃反革命阴谋。尽管反动派首领完全被人民唾弃，逃到国外去了，但是哺育倒霉的土地依然存在。资本家虽已减少，但在捷克仍还存在着。
    反动派妄想依靠帝国主义的武装干涉，外国情报局正在制造破坏和怠工的阴谋。
    一九四八年二月阴谋违背广大的人民底意志的反动派道路，已经清楚地表明了：那就是地下组织，与外国紧密联系，间谍活动，怠工和受审判。
    这种典型底全部展览后来在布拉格法院举行了。那就是审询姆列捷克，杜马教授及其一群破坏分子——一个学生的恐怖主义者底团体。
    军队和公安队开始给人民服务了。青年工人获有充分地提拔为干部和掌握重要职位的机会。
    全国一切政权和经济机构中都反复地进行了检定和研究，研究和检定的工作。
    无论民主敌人怎样叫嚣他们的卑鄙的地下活动，捷克斯洛伐克底人民仍是镇静地充满信心地沿着他们已经选择好了的社会主义的道路前进。
    “五年计划是走向社会主义的道路”——这是现今在捷克斯洛伐克最流行的口号。而这个计划的成功就是要依靠劳动，努力争取，就是一次紧张而顽强的斗争。
    我们曾经参观了一个小小的厄维尔尼斯矿城。这个矿坑因一个捷克底民族英雄（在战争中牺牲了的）游击队员詹·斯兀马的名字而得名。它的矿工正在慰劳以这英雄命名的第七十八步兵营。市政当局和他们的来宾——士兵、指挥员及詹·斯兀马底故乡弗哈底斯在内的其他城镇的代表们——都作了热烈地讲演，阐述唯一的观点：一个清除了资本家的渣滓，从发展道路上肃清了社会的糟粕和叛徒的国家，一个由经过战斗锻炼的共产党领导的工人阶级的国家是不能够战胜的。
    与努力实行五年计划同时，是使人民养成新的社会主义的精神。捷克人民从来也不曾有过象今天这样强烈地追求知识、爱好文艺。几十个无产阶级和农民出身的青年男女已经在学习为工人将来上大学或专科学校新开的预备课程。高等教育对他们说来曾经是不能得到的奢侈品，现在他们却在准备作专家和工人阶级知识分子了。
    过去三年中，出版了二十余万册苏联共产党历史简明教程。列宁、斯大林底著作印行了几万册，立即被购买一空。马列主义的文学作品真是供不应求。共产党底出版物底销数是不断地增加着。
    关于出版业正在采取适当步骤加以整顿。国会正考虑关于书籍的出版和分配的方案。
    各工厂、工场以及行将开始春耕的农场均在为五年计划而斗争。在文化战线上也同样有这样毫不松懈的斗争。………（王更生节译自新时代一九四九年第十期）
