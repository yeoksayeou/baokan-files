Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 31st -- The Political Department of the People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army recently issued a circular to the entire army, calling on them to value and cherish small and medium cities. The circular first pointed out: Our army has liberated many small and medium cities during its southward advance. Due to the lack of sufficient attention paid to these small and medium cities in the minds of the troops (individual serious phenomena of lax discipline and disruption of urban order have occurred, and these phenomena are specifically manifested as follows: many troops are crowded into small cities, such as eight units residing in a county town with a population of only over 10,000, with more than 1,000 livestock and more than 2,000 people, resulting in extreme congestion throughout the city. Some troops reside in shops, schools, and civilian houses in the city. Some units even set up stoves at the entrances of shops along the street, making it impossible for merchants to do business. Some troops, due to supply difficulties, exchange grain for vegetables when they cannot buy them, or collect grain on the streets when they have no grain. Some troops ask Baojia chiefs to borrow utensils on their behalf, while the Baojia chiefs use the method of requisitioning from citizens to purchase goods, as they did when supporting the Kuomintang reactionaries. These phenomena of disrupting urban discipline, although individual, are serious, and if they are not quickly corrected, they will inevitably damage the unity between the army and the people, affect urban-rural mutual assistance and economic prosperity, and at the same time, deepen the difficulties in the supply work of the large army. To correct the above shortcomings, the circular pointed out that education on urban policies and urban discipline must be carried out in the troops. The urban policies and urban discipline of the People's Liberation Army must be implemented not only in large cities, but also in small and medium cities. The circular decided:

    1.  Establish urban area management committees in small and medium cities, with the local government as the main body and the participation of the military, as the highest management authority, responsible for maintaining discipline, protecting the city, and supporting the War of Liberation. If government personnel have not yet entered the city, the army may be responsible. When the troops advance, cadres should be left behind to explain the urban situation to subsequent troops or the government.

    2.  The urban area management committee should appoint special personnel to establish an office to solve the supply and accommodation problems of passing troops, and formulate specific measures to protect the city according to the actual situation, announce them widely, and jointly form a patrol team by the army and the local government to inspect and maintain urban discipline.

    3.  The entry of large troops into the city must be approved by the urban management committee. Large vehicles and livestock of the troops are not allowed to live in the city. Troop housing must be subject to the distribution of the urban management committee. Purchasing large quantities of materials should be discussed with the urban management committee to avoid affecting prices. When disputes occur between the troops and the local government, they should be resolved in the spirit of self-criticism.

    第四野战军通令全军
    保护中小城市
    贯彻解放军爱护城市政策
    【新华社汉口三十一日电】人民解放军第四野战军政治部日前向全军发出通报，号召全军重视和爱护中小城市。通报首先指出：我军南进中解放了许多中小城市。由于部队在思想上对这些中小城市重视不够（已发生个别纪律松懈、城市秩序被破坏的严重现象，这些现象具体表现为：许多部队人马挤在小城市里，如在一个仅有一万多人口的县城里就住了八个单位，有一千余匹牲口，两千多人，以致全城拥挤不堪。有些部队住在城里的商店、学校、民房中。有的单位甚至在沿街商店门口都设上锅灶，使商人无法营业。某些部队因供给困难，买不到菜就拿粮食去换，没有粮食就在街上筹粮。有的部队托保甲长代借用具，而保甲长则袭用支应国民党反动军队的办法，强令市民派款购买。这些破坏城市纪律的现象，虽然是个别的，但是严重的，如不很快纠正，势必损坏军民团结，影响城乡互助和经济繁荣，同时也将加深大军供应工作的困难。为纠正上述缺点，该通报指出必须在部队中进行城市政策和城市纪律的教育，人民解放军的城市政策和城市纪律不仅在大城市中要执行，在中小城市中同样也要执行。通报决定：
    一、在中小城市中成立城区管理委员会，以地方政府为主体，吸收军队方面参加，作为最高管理机关，负责维持纪律，保护城市，支援解放战争。如政府人员尚未进城，可由军队负责，部队前进时应留下干部，向后继部队或政府交代城市情况。
    二、城区管理委员会应委派专人建立办公室，解决过往部队的供给和住宿问题，并根据实际情况，制定保护城市具体办法，布告周知，由军队和地方合组纠察队，检查和维护城市纪律。
    三、部队的大队人员进城，须经城市管理委员会的同意。部队的大车牲口不得进城居住。部队住房、要服从城管会分配。购买大批物资要和城管会商量，以免影响物价。部队与地方政府发生纠纷时，应本自我批评的精神来解决。
