    Proclamation of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Beiping Military Control Commission
    Proclamation No. 12

    It has been found that recently, public-owned industrial and commercial enterprises, as well as institutions and schools from various regions, when purchasing materials in this city, have often failed to comply with the regulations of the North China People's Government by going through trade companies for procurement. This has allowed unscrupulous merchants to take the opportunity to engage in speculative activities, disrupt the market, and greatly affect commodity prices in this city. In order to correct this state of anarchy, it is decided that all public-owned enterprises or trade units from various regions, or administrative organizations stationed in Beiping, as well as production departments of various levels of organs in Beiping, that need to purchase materials in the market of this city, regardless of whether they have already completed the purchase or are preparing to purchase, must register with the Beiping Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau within one week from the date of this proclamation, accurately report the types, quantities, and uses of the purchases, and establish contact with the Beiping Trade Company. Violators will be dealt with according to the law. This is hereby proclaimed.
          Director: Ye Jianying
          August 7th, 38th Year of the Republic of China
