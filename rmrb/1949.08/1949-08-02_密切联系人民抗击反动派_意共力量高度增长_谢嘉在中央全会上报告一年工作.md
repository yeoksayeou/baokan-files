Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 1st. Tass, Rome, July 29th: The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party recently held a plenary session, where Deputy General Secretary Xie Jia (formerly translated as Xie Jie) reported to the plenary session on the work of the Communist Party over the past year and its growing influence in the country.

    Xie Jia declared: "The past year has been a year of active work for our party, a year of great struggle for the Italian working people, the working class, and their vanguard. July 14, 1948—the day of the assassination attempt on Togliatti—served as a signal for the church regime and reactionary forces to launch an offensive in an attempt to shatter the unity of democratic groups, create divisions in trade union ranks, and isolate our party from the working masses of the Italian people. Our enemies did not achieve these goals because their offensive met with resolute and forceful resistance from the Italian people.

    From July 14, 1948, to this day, all the battles waged by the Italian working people—the great national battles of metalworkers, civil servants, chemical workers, railway employees, textile workers, construction workers, and recently farm laborers and agricultural workers—have demonstrated the fighting ability, enthusiasm, and unity of the proletariat and all working people, as well as the strength, influence, and organizational capabilities of the Communist Party.

    The results of these battles, the results of the elections in Sardinia and the Aosta Valley Province, the results of local elections in some important areas, the results of trade union elections for chemical workers, railway workers, and food workers, and the results of elections for factory (trade union) committees in enterprises, prove that the influence of the Communist Party is steadily rising.

    However, this does not mean that political violence, arrests, the murder of working people, and dismissals have had no impact on the situation. If the working class and all working people and their organizations have indeed demonstrated exemplary resistance and counterattack capabilities, and if the Communist Party has indeed held high the banner and fulfilled its vanguard role, it is also true that the more complex situation created by the offensive of the tycoons and church political forces has complicated the party's struggle and work even further."

    Here, Xie Jia listed the names of dozens of working people who have been killed in peaceful demonstrations and trade union struggles over the past year. In the period from July 14, 1948, to June 30, 1949, 14,573 working people were imprisoned. In addition, 13,794 working people were accused. Among those arrested were 17 mayors, 77 secretaries of trade union committees, 375 leaders of local trade unions, and 515 former guerrillas. Communists in areas such as Emilia, Tuscany, Apulia, and Calabria have been subjected to particularly brutal persecution.

    密切联系人民抗击反动派
    意共力量高度增长
    谢嘉在中央全会上报告一年工作
    【新华社北平一日电】塔斯社罗马七月二十九日讯：意大利共产党中央委员会顷举行全体会议，副总书记谢嘉（前译谢杰）向全会报告共产党过去一年的工作及其在国内影响增长的情形。
    谢嘉宣称：“过去的一年，是我党积极工作的一年，是意大利劳动人民、工人阶级及其先锋队伟大战斗的一年。一九四八年七月十四日——谋刺托格里亚蒂的那一天——成为教会政权和反动势力发动攻势，以求粉碎民主团体的团结、造成职工会队伍中的分裂、和把我党从意大利人民劳动群众孤立开来的警号。我们的敌人并没有达到这些目的，因为他们的攻势遇到了意大利人民坚决有力的抵抗。
    从一九四八年七月十四日起一直到今天为止，意大利劳动人民进行过的一切战斗——金属工人、公务员、化学工人、铁路员工、纺织工人、建筑工人和最近农场雇工和农业工人的伟大的全国性战斗，证明了无产阶级和全体劳动人民的战斗能力、热情与团结，以及共产党的力量、影响和组织能力。
    这些战斗的结果，撒丁尼亚和阿奥斯塔河谷省选的结果，某些重要地区地方选举的结果，化学工人、铁路工人、食品工人的职工会选举的结果，和企业中厂内（职工会）委员会选举的结果，证明共产党的影响是在稳步上升着。
    但是，这并不是说，政治暴力、逮捕、谋杀劳动人民和解雇等迫害行为，对于局势就全无影响。如果说，工人阶级与一切劳动人民以及他们的组织，的确表现了足资典范的抵抗力量和反击能力，如果说，共产党的确高举着旗帜尽了先锋队的作用，那么，下面的情形也是实在的，即由于大亨们和教会政治势力之攻势而产生的更为复杂的情况，使党的斗争和工作更为复杂化了。”
    这里，谢嘉历举了一年来在和平示威和职工会斗争中被杀的数十名劳动人民的名字。在从一九四八年七月十四日到一九四九年六月三十日这一时期中，有一万四千五百七十三名劳动人民被监禁。此外，还有一万三千七百九十四名劳动人民被控诉。在被捕的人中间，有十七名市长，七十七名工会委员会的书记，三百七十五名地方工会的领袖和五百一十五名前游击队员。共产党员在艾米利亚、杜斯坎尼、阿蒲利亚和卡拉布里亚等地区受到的迫害特别残酷。
