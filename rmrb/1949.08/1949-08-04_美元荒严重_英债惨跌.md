Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, August 3rd: Associated Press, London: British government bonds have been falling continuously since July 25th. By the 28th, they had fallen to their lowest prices since the darkest days of World War II. The selling wave at the opening of the London Stock Exchange caused most government bonds to fall by several fractions of a point, even a whole "point." Bonds have rebounded slightly, but brokers believe this is temporary. Generally, people are pessimistic and believe that the decline caused by Britain's severe dollar shortage will continue. War bonds issued in 1935 with a face value of 100 pounds fell to 97.5 pounds. In the past, even during the British army's retreat from Dunkirk, they only fell to 98 pounds.

    美元荒严重
    英债惨跌
    【新华社北平三日电】美联社伦敦讯：英政府公债自七月二十五日起连续下跌，至二十八日止，已跌至第二次世界大战中最黑暗时代以来的最低价格，伦敦交易所开盘时的抛售浪潮，使大多数政府公债均下跌数分数毫，甚至下跌整“点”。公债曾略有回涨，但经纪人认为这是暂时的。一般都抱悲观，认为英国严重的美元荒所造成的下跌，将继续下去。一九三五年发行的票面额为一百英镑的战争公债，跌至九十七点五磅。过去在英军撤离敦克尔刻时，也仅落至九十八镑。
