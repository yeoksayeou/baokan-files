Strengthening Leadership and Unifying Publishing
　　North China's Publishing Industry Flourishes
	300 Books, 8 Million Copies Published in Half a Year; Important Book Version Discrepancies Overcome
　　[Our Newspaper Comprehensive Report] Since the liberation of Peiping and Tianjin, the Party's publishing work in North China has entered a new era. In late February, the Publishing Committee of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Party was established to unify the leadership of the state-owned publishing industry in Peiping, Tianjin, and the entire North China region, and to uniformly handle the publication of national publications. With the strengthening of the Party's leadership, significant progress has been made in the work. According to incomplete statistics over the past six months, the Liberation Press and Xinhua Bookstore have published more than 320 kinds of books, totaling more than 8 million copies. Among them are 53 kinds of literary series, more than 10 kinds of policy documents, 13 kinds of women's movement series and documents, etc. A large-scale publication of 12 kinds of essential theoretical books for cadres was carried out. It undertook the huge task of publishing the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, and published 7 kinds of primary school textbooks (in 29 volumes) and 16 kinds of middle school textbooks (in 26 volumes). The total number of middle and primary school textbooks printed by ourselves and by organizing external forces reached 6 million copies. With the addition of some areas that printed them locally, the supply problem of primary school textbooks in the North China region has been largely resolved this semester. At present, new books published by the Liberation Press and important national publications are sent by the Publishing Committee to major liberated strategic areas for local reprinting, and general books are also provided with samples. In this way, the past phenomenon of version discrepancies in various places has been greatly improved, errors have been reduced compared with the past, and a large amount of manpower and financial resources have been saved, preparing conditions for further unifying the national public publishing industry.

　　加强领导统一出版
  　华北出版业发达
    半年出书三百种共八百万册已克服重要书籍版本分歧现象
    【本报综合报导】平津解放以后，华北地区党的出版工作，走上了一个新时期。二月下旬党中央宣传部出版委员会成立，统一领导平津和整个华北地区的国营出版事业，统一办理全国性出版物的出版工作。党的领导加强了，工作有了显著的进展。半年来据不完全的统计，解放社和新华书店出版了书籍三百二十余种，共八百余万册。其中文艺丛书五十三种，关于政策的文件十余种，妇运丛书和文献等十三种，进行了干部必读理论书十二种的大规模的出版工作，担负了出版毛泽东选集的巨大任务，并出版了小学教科书七种（分二十九册）和中学教科书十六种（分二十六册），中、小学教科书自己印出及组织外力印出共达六百万册，加上一部分地区在当地自行印造的，本学期华北区小学教科书的供应问题已大体上解决了。目前解放社版新书和重要的全国性读物，都由出版委员会分寄纸型至各大解放战略地区供各地翻印，一般书籍亦供给样本。这样，大大改善了过去各地版本分歧的现象，错误亦较前减少了，并节省了大量的人力与财力，替进一步统一全国公营出版事业，准备了条件。
