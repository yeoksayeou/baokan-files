　　The Struggle Between the New and the Old Has Fundamental Differences in Societies of Different Natures
    Zhang Fan
    The law of all development is the struggle of opposites, the struggle between the new and the old, the struggle between decay and regeneration. However, in socialist society, the struggle between the new and the old is fundamentally different from that under the capitalist system. Therefore, this struggle must also have its special manifestations and laws.
    In Soviet society, the nature of the relations of production and the productive forces are perfectly suited to each other. There are no antagonistic classes in Soviet society, so the struggle of the new against the old will not take on an antagonistic nature, but will appear entirely in a new form. This new law of dialectics is criticism and self-criticism, as pointed out by Zhdanov in "On Questions of the History of Philosophy and the Tasks of the Philosophical Front at Present."
    Under the socialist system, there are no relations of production or social classes that hinder the development of productive forces, so revolutionary struggle is not required, only constant criticism and self-criticism that can inspire progress and strive for new and higher achievements. The revolutionary form of self-criticism expressed in mass work, relying on the creative initiative of workers, is socialist competition.
    In short, criticism and self-criticism, as a new dialectical law unique to Soviet society, relies on the leadership and guidance of the Bolshevik Party in leading the Soviet people to engage in the struggle against backwardness, conservatism, and decay. The criticism and self-criticism practiced in such a struggle is the real driving force behind the development of Soviet society.

　　新与旧之间的斗争在不同性质的社会中有着原则上的区别
    张帆
    一切发展的规律，都是对立斗争，新与旧之间的斗争，衰亡与新生的斗争。但是，在社会主义社会中，新与旧之间的斗争，与在资本主义制度下的是有着原则上的不同性质的。所以，这种斗争也必然有它的特殊的表现形式和规律。
    在苏维埃社会里，生产关系和生产力底性质完全相适合。苏维埃社会里没有敌对阶级，于是新事物反对旧事物的斗争也就不会带着敌对的性质，而完全是用新的形式出现。这个新的辩证法法则就是日丹诺夫在“论哲学史诸问题及目前哲学战线的任务”中所指出的批评与自我批评。
    在社会主义制度下，没有那种阻止生产力发展的生产关系或社会阶级，所以并不要求革命斗争，只是要求经常的能鼓舞前进的，向新的最高成就奔去的批评与自我批评。依赖于劳动者创造的主动性，所表现于群众性工作上革命的自我批评形式，就是社会主义竞赛。
    要之，批评与自我批评，作为一种新的，属于苏维埃社会所独有的辩证法法则，是依靠布尔什维克党的领导和指导苏维埃人民从事反对落后、保守和衰颓的斗争。在这样的斗争中所实行的批评与自我批评，就是苏维埃社会发展底真正的动力。
