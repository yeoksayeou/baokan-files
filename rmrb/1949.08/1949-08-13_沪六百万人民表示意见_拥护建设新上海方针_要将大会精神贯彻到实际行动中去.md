    Six Million People in Shanghai Express Their Opinions
    Supporting the Policy of Building a New Shanghai
    Vowing to Implement the Spirit of the Congress in Practical Action
    [Report from this newspaper] Shanghai News: The report made by Comrade Rao Shushi, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the Shanghai People's Representative Conference on crushing the enemy's blockade and building a new Shanghai has become the guiding principle for the actions of the six million people of Shanghai. Since the conclusion of the Representative Conference, people from all walks of life have expressed their opinions and determined their future course of action.
    Zhu Junxin, a representative of the Trade Union Federation, believes that this People's Representative Conference is unprecedented in the history of Shanghai. He said: "We must quickly and widely promote and educate the workers about the content of the conference. The workers of all private factories in Shanghai must take the initiative to unite and urge the capitalists to strive to implement the six major tasks." Chen Sanlian, a representative of the cigarette industry workers, said: "This time, all circles in Shanghai have unanimously agreed to the six major policies proposed by the Communist Party to overcome the current difficulties. Therefore, we must resolutely implement them. For example, for the tobacco leaves needed by the cigarette industry, Xu州 (Xuzhou) and 蚌埠 (Bengbu) and other places in our country have production. We must actively find ways to implement the relocation of some factories inland. We must not have dependence thinking. We must rely on our own efforts." Zhang Yijun, a representative of the silk weaving industry workers, proposed: We workers must automatically save and reduce costs; We hope that the capitalists should be open and honest about the difficulties and solve them together, establish normal labor-capital relations, and overcome the current difficulties. Huang Jinzhu, a representative of the machinery industry workers, said: "The main raw materials for the machinery industry are coal and iron, which are produced in large quantities inland. There are fewer machine parts in the machinery industry and they are easy to transport. The workers in the machinery industry generally want to go to the inland to develop production."
    Hu Juewen of the industrial and commercial sector said: "Relocating factories inland is an important move in implementing the six major tasks. We should make pre-arrangements in a step-by-step and planned manner. The supply of power and raw materials, the estimation of sales, and the appropriate coordination of various industries must all be carefully planned." Sheng Pihua believes that: This meeting is very educational for our industrial and commercial circles. After the meeting, everyone feels that their knowledge is not enough and they cannot thoroughly understand the current earth-shaking changes. Therefore, many people are asking to study. Regarding the six major tasks of building a new Shanghai, Mr. Sheng believes that they must be implemented. Ms. Min Shufen of the industrial and commercial sector said: The Shanghai People's Representative Conference is an unprecedented meeting of great significance. I deeply feel that only by truly representing the interests of the people can the strongest strength be demonstrated. National capitalists and workers have reached an understanding through criticism and mutual criticism, and everyone has achieved further unity. I also feel that the industrial and commercial sectors should no longer rely entirely on the government to solve difficulties. Now is a good opportunity for the national industry to turn over. Labor-capital issues should be patiently negotiated with the workers. Capital problems should be organized for production with people who have idle funds. Under the leadership of the People's Government, industry and commerce can obtain legitimate profits.

    沪六百万人民表示意见
    拥护建设新上海方针
    要将大会精神贯彻到实际行动中去
    【本报讯】上海消息：中共上海市委书记饶漱石同志在上海市各界代表会议上所作粉碎敌人封锁、建设新上海的报告，已成为上海六百万人民行动的指针。代表会议自闭幕后，各阶层人民纷纷表示意见，确定今后的行动步骤。
    总工会代表朱俊欣认为这次各界代表会议，在上海的历史上说是空前的。他说：“我们要迅速把会议内容在工友间广泛进行宣传教育，我们全上海私营厂家的工人一定要主动地团结和推动资方，为贯彻执行六大任务而奋斗。”卷烟业工人代表陈三连说：“这次上海各界都一致同意中共提出的克服目前困难的六大方针，那么，就要坚决来执行，象卷烟业所需的烟叶，我国徐州、蚌埠等地都有出产，就要积极想办法，实行部分工厂内迁，不要有依赖思想，要自力更生。”丝织业工人代表张翼钧提出：我们工人要自动节约，减低成本；希望资方有困难要开诚布公，共同解决，建立正常的劳资关系，克服目前困难。机器业工人代表黄金柱说：“机器业的主要原料是煤和铁，这些内地都有大量出产，机器业的机器零件较少，容易搬运，机器业的工人们，一般都愿意到内地去发展生产。”
    产业界胡厥文说：“工厂内迁是执行六大任务的重要一着，我们应该有步骤、有计划的预先布置，动力与原料的供应，销路的估计，各种工业的适当配合，都须有周密的筹谋。”盛丕华认为：这次会对我们工商界教育非常大，开了会以后，大家都感到自己知识不够，不能透澈认识目前翻天覆地的大变更。因此很多人要求学习。关于建设新上海的六大任务，盛先生认为必须要实行。产业界闵淑芬女士说：上海市各界代表会议是空前的有着伟大意义的一个会议，我深深感到唯有确实代表了人民利益才能表现最坚强的力量，民族资本家与工人在批评与互相批评中取得了谅解，大家有了进一步团结。我也觉得产业界应该不再把困难完全依靠政府来解决，目前正是民族工业翻身的好机会，劳资问题应该与工人来耐心协商，资金问题该向拥有游资的人来进行组织生产，在人民政府主持下，工商业是有合法利润可得的。
