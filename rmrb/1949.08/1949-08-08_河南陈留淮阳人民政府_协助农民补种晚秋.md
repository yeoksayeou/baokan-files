    Henan Chenliu and Huaiyang People's Government
    Assists Farmers in Replanting Late Autumn Crops
    [This newspaper dispatch] Kaifeng News: Since the widespread rainfall in Chenliu and Huaiyang Prefectures, Henan Province, in early July (the two areas had experienced a long drought), the local governments have been actively assisting the masses in rushing to plant and replant late autumn crops. Before the rains, Chenliu Prefecture had already issued seed loans and mobilized the masses to exchange and borrow seeds, resolving the planting difficulties for over one million mu of land for poor farmers. After the rains, the farmers' enthusiasm for production greatly increased. Each county has extended the summer grain requisition by three days to fully assist local farmers in planting. Currently, in the prefecture's total planting area of more than 5.9 million mu, the 20% of land with missing seedlings and 15% of land with dead seedlings have been completely replanted. After the rains, the Huaiyang Sub-Administrative Office specifically decided to issue 250,000 jin of interest-free seed loans and instructed all counties, districts, and townships to seize the post-rain period to rush-plant late autumn crops. If it is too late, farmers can be called upon to plant sweet potatoes and radishes. The farmers are currently engaged in intensive rush-planting and seedling replanting.

    河南陈留淮阳人民政府
    协助农民补种晚秋
    【本报讯】开封消息：河南陈留、淮阳分区人民政府，自上月初旬境内各地普遍降雨后（该两地曾久旱不雨），积极协助群众抢种补种晚秋。雨前陈留分区曾贷发种籽，发动群众互换互借，解决了贫苦农民百余万亩种米困难，此次雨后，农民生产情绪大为高涨，各县特延缓夏季征粮三天，全力协助该地农民种植。现全区五百九十余万亩种地面积中，百分之二十空苗地，百分之十五瞎苗地已全部种齐。淮阳分署雨后特决定发放二十五万斤无利贷种，并指示各县、区、乡抓紧雨后时期抢种晚秋，如已过迟，可号召农民栽红芋，种葫萝卜等。现农民正在紧张抢种补苗。
