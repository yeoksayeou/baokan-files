The Reality of Sino-US Relations
　　Wang Cheng

　　American imperialism invades our country and colludes with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to slaughter our people. Its crimes are heinous, yet it constantly talks about the "traditional friendship between China and the United States" and how long-lasting it is. The recently published White Paper on China by the US government can be regarded as a "confession without being forced," exposing its hideous face. In order to give general readers a general understanding of "Sino-US relations," I hastily wrote this article for reference when reading the newspaper.

　　Parvenu

　　In 1492, a man named Columbus discovered the New World of America. Since then, the continent of America has appeared on the world map. Therefore, the history of the United States is only about four hundred years old. If we start from the year it broke away from Britain and became independent (1776), it would be even shorter.

　　The discovery of America had a reason. Originally, in the 14th and 15th centuries, European industry and commerce were very developed, and a large number of exchange mediums were needed. At this time, Germany, which produced the most silver, could no longer supply such a large need, so it had to open up to other places, which promoted the discovery of America.

　　Speaking of Americans, they are all composed of small bourgeois and peasants who fled from various European countries. The original natives were either killed or driven into the mountains, and these so-called "refugees" established a new country of free capitalism on this new continent. Therefore, "America from the very beginning was modern, bourgeois." (Engels)

　　Although the United States was a capitalist country from the beginning, the black slave system was still prevalent for a while. The North had developed industry and needed free laborers, while the South had dominant agriculture and needed black slaves. As a result, the North-South War broke out in 1861-65. In this battle, the North won, and the black slaves were liberated. From then on, capitalism achieved a decisive victory in the United States.

　　After the victory of the North in the Civil War, American capitalism developed rapidly, quickly developing to the stage of imperialism and becoming a parvenu among the imperialist powers. After two world wars, it jumped to become the leader of the imperialist robber gang.

　　The Story of "Gold Mountain"

　　When Cantonese people go to the United States, they usually say they are going to "Gold Mountain." Now there is a place in the United States, which was first developed by the Chinese people, and it is also called "Old Gold Mountain" (San Francisco). Speaking of the development of American capitalism, one cannot help but think of the story of "Gold Mountain"—because here is the blood and sweat of the Chinese working people.

　　Marx said: "North America uses machines, partly because of competition with other countries, and also because of the lack of manpower." Especially in the early days of American development, more manpower was needed, and cheap foreign workers became the objects welcomed by capitalists. And among foreign laborers, those with the lowest living standards, the most able to endure hardship and hard work, and the cheapest price, of course, are the "yellow-faced Chinese." (Engels)

　　What about our China? Since the Opium War, it has been impossible to close itself off, and the Great Wall has been trampled on by the iron hooves of capitalism. Capitalism invaded China, destroying China's self-sufficient small economy, so many people were forced to leave their homes and find a way to live, and the first to bear the brunt were the coastal people who had the earliest contact with capitalism (such as Guangzhou and Fujian). Driven by life, they went overseas to the United States to make a living where there was a shortage of labor. Because at that time, the Chinese people who went to the United States mostly worked in the gold mines in the western United States, so at that time, when talking about going to the United States, it was said that they were going to "Gold Mountain." The name "Gold Mountain" became popular. After the end of the American Civil War, the number of Chinese people going to the United States increased day by day. After the Sino-Japanese War, even more people went. Here is the number of Chinese workers who went to the United States at that time. We will have a clear understanding after reading it.
Year　　　　　　Number of people
　　1850　　　　800
　　1851　　　　4,000
　　1852　　　　25,000
　　1867　　　　50,000
　　1868　　　　80,000

　　The reason why the number of Chinese workers increased year by year is because they were quite popular. Why were they popular? Because they were beneficial to the capitalists. Based on this, in 1868, the Sino-US governments signed a Burlingame Treaty, expressing welcome to Chinese laborers. The general meaning of the article is as follows:

　　1. Chinese people can freely move to the United States and enjoy the most-favored-nation rights;
　　2. Americans can also freely move to China.

　　Judging from this treaty, the Chinese people were very popular, but behind the "enjoyment of the most-favored-nation rights" was hidden the inhuman exploitation of the Chinese working people.

　　However, even this welcome only lasted for twenty years. In 1880, the US government signed another new treaty with our country, imposing strict restrictions on the previous treaty. In 1882, the US Congress passed another law restricting the exclusion of Chinese workers, which meant that they were no longer welcome. The main content of the treaty is as follows:

　　1. Chinese workers are prohibited from entering the country for ten years;
　　2. Regardless of whether Chinese workers are skilled or unskilled, they are all prohibited from working in American mines.

　　Ten years later, the Geary Act (The Garry Act. 1892) was promulgated, which was even more impolite to the Chinese people. Look:

　　1. The Restriction Act remains effective;
　　2. All Chinese who have entered the country must register.

　　In 1924, the US government re-promulgated the new immigration law, which was even more insulting to the Chinese working people. The main points are as follows:

　　1. All Chinese workers are not allowed to enter the United States;
　　2. If Chinese residing in the United States fall from the non-worker class to the worker class, they may be deported by the US government;
　　3. Chinese students, teachers, officials, businessmen and travelers can enter the country.

　　Why were Chinese working people first welcomed and then excluded? This is because Chinese working people were beneficial to capitalists in the beginning. However, later, in order to use Chinese workers to depress wage levels, capitalists used ethnic prejudices, provoked national sentiments, and alienated the combination of Chinese and American workers, so that Chinese workers could not unanimously demand to improve their living standards with American workers, so they excluded Chinese workers. But the capitalists put the blame for excluding Chinese workers on the Chinese workers, saying that Chinese workers were "not easy to assimilate," and so on.

　　"Gold Mountain" has now been created. The people who created "Gold Mountain" are rejected, and the students, teachers, businessmen, and officials who worship "Gold Mountain" are very welcome. After returning to China, most of these people are the ones who promote "American civilization" and say that "the American moon is better than the Chinese moon."

　　中美关系实况
    王城
    美国帝国主义侵略我国，会同蒋匪屠杀我国人民，罪恶滔天，但它却张口闭口说“中美传统友谊”如何长短。最近美国政府所公布之对华白皮书，可算是“不打自招”地暴露了狰狞面孔。笔者为了使一般读者对“中美关系”有一概括认识，忽促写成此文，以供读报参考。
    暴发户
    一四九二年，有一个人名叫哥伦布，发现了美洲新大陆，从此以后，在世界地图上就出现了美洲这块地方。所以美国的历史，计算起来，到现在不过四百多年的光景罢了。如果从它脱离英国而独立的那一年算起（一七七六年），那就更短了。
    美洲的发现，是有一个来由的。原来，在十四、十五世纪时，欧洲工商业非常发达，需要很多的交换媒介，而这时，产银最多的德国，已供给不了这么大的需要了，于是只有向其他地方开拓，这样，便促成了美洲的发现。
    说起美国人来，他们都是从欧洲各国流浪去的小资产阶级和农民组成的，原来的土人，有的被杀，有的被赶入深山，而这些所谓“难民”就在这新大陆上建立起自由资本主义的新国家来。所以“美国从最开始就是现代的、资产阶级的。”（恩格斯）
    虽然，美国一开始就是资本主义的国家，但是黑奴制仍盛行一时。北方工业发达，需要自由劳动者，南方农业占优势，需要黑奴。结果在一八六一——六五年爆发了南北战争。这一仗，北方是打胜了，黑奴得到了解放。从此，资本主义在美国取得了决定意义的胜利。
    南北战争北方胜利后，美国资本主义获得猛烈的发展，很快的发展到帝国主义阶段，成为帝国主义列强中的暴发户。迄经两次世界大战，它便一跃而为帝国主义强盗队伍中的魁首了。
    “金山”的故事
    广东人到美国去，惯说到“金山”去。现在美国有一个地方，那是中国人民最早开辟的，也叫“旧金山”。说起美国资本主义的发展来，不能不使人想起“金山”的故事。——因为这里有中国劳动人民的血汗。
    马克思说：“北美引用机器，一则由于和其他国家的竞争，同时也因为缺乏人手。”特别是在美国开发的初期，更需要人力，廉价的外国工人，便成为资本家所欢迎的对象了。而外国劳动者中生活程度最低，最能吃苦耐劳，价钱又便宜的，当然要算“黄脸的中国人”了。（恩格斯）
    咱们中国呢？自从鸦片战争之后，要闭关自守，已不可能，万里长城，被资本主义的铁蹄踏破了。资本主义侵入中国，破坏了中国自给自足的小经济，因此许多人被迫离乡背井，去找活路，而首当其冲的是接触资本主义最早的沿海人民，（如广州、福建）被生活所迫，便远涉重洋，到缺乏劳工的美国去谋生。因为当时中国人民到美国去的，多在美国西部金矿中去做工，所以当时说到美国去，就说是到“金山”去。“金山”这个名字便叫开了。当美国南北战争结束，中国人民到美国去的日增，迄中日战争后，去的人就更多了。这里有一个当时到美国去的华工的数目，我们看后，会一目了然的。年份　　　　　　人数一八五○　　　　八百人一八五一　　　　四千人一八五二　　　　二万五千人一八六七　　　　五万人一八六八　　　　八万人
    华工逐年增加的原因，是因为他们颇受欢迎，为什么受欢迎呢？因为他们对资本家有利。基于此，在一八六八年时，中美政府，便订了一个蒲安臣条约（Ｔｈｅ　Ｂｕｒｌｉｎｇａｍｅ　ｔｒｅａｔｙ）表示欢迎中国劳工。条文大意如次：
    一　中国人民可以自由迁入美国，而得享受最惠国权利；
    二　美国人亦得自由移入中国。
    从这个条约看来，中国人民是很受欢迎的了，但在“亨受最惠国的权利”背后，却隐藏着对中国劳动人民非人的剥削。
    但是，就这欢迎，也只有二十年的光景，到一八八○年，美国政府就和我国另订新约，把以前所订条约，加以严密限制。在一八八二年，美国国会又通过了排斥华工的限制法，就表示不欢迎了。那条约的主要内容是这样的：
    一　在十年内禁止华工入境；
    二　不论华工是熟练工还是非熟练工，一律禁止在美国矿产中作工。
    十年之后，又有加来法（Ｔｈｅ　Ｇａｒｒｙ　Ａｃｔ．１８９２）颁布，对于中国人民就更不客气了。你看：
    一　限制法以后仍有效；
    二　凡已入境之华人，一律须登记。
    到一九二四年，美国政府又重新颁布了新移民律，对中国劳动人民，更是百般侮辱。其大要如下：
    一　凡是华工一律不得入美国境内；
    二　凡留美华侨由非工人堕入工人阶级，得由美国政府驱逐出境；
    三　中国学生、教员、官吏、商人及旅行者可以入境。
    中国劳动人民为什么先受欢迎后遭排斥呢？这是因为中国劳动人民在先头对资本家有利原故。不过后来资本家为了利用华工压低工资水平，便利用种族成见，挑拨民族感情，离间中美工人的结合，使华工不能同美国工人一致要求提高生活水平，因此排斥华工。但资本家却把排斥华工的罪名加在华工身上，说华工“不易同化”云云。
    “金山”现在是创造好了，创造“金山”的人被摈弃，崇拜“金山”的学子、教员、商人、官吏是大受欢迎。这批人回国之后，大多数就是宣扬“美国文明”，说“美国月亮比中国好”的人们。　　　（本节完，全文未完）
