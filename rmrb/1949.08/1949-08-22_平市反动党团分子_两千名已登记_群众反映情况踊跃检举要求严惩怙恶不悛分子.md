　　Counter-Revolutionary Party Members in Beiping
  　Two Thousand Have Registered
    Masses Actively Report Information and Demand Severe Punishment for Stubbornly Unrepentant Elements
    [Our Newspaper] In order to thoroughly eliminate counter-revolutionary remnants and consolidate revolutionary order, the Municipal Public Security Bureau recently convened a joint meeting of various public sector departments to exchange experiences in the work of registering counter-revolutionary party members during this period, in order to continue to carry out the work in depth. Since the registration began on July 25th, as of yesterday (August 21st), more than two thousand counter-revolutionary party members have registered at various registration offices. Various sub-bureaus and major enterprise departments such as the Ministry of Railways, the Telecommunications Bureau, the Postal Administration, and the 70th Arsenal have all launched in-depth publicity and mobilization efforts. Leaders are personally involved, conducting registration in conjunction with study sessions. The Ministry of Railways has also used various forms of publicity such as broadcasting and wall newspapers. Currently, fifty people have registered, including thirty-four counter-revolutionary party leaders above the district level and sixteen special agents. Based on mass reports, four hundred and seventeen people were exposed. The list of counter-revolutionary organization personnel handed over by the registered leaders includes four hundred and thirty-seven people.
    From the registration during this period, it has been found that some counter-revolutionary party members have adopted various despicable and shameless means to evade registration with our People's Government. Li Shengpu, the head of the anti-Communist Democratic Socialist Party's Beiping Municipal Party Committee, was notified three times by our Public Security Bureau to come to the bureau to register. Not only did he stubbornly refuse to register, but he also openly engaged in sabotage, leading his entire family to smash our registration office and injure our staff. Some enemy party leaders and special agents also prevaricated, only admitting to being ordinary counter-revolutionary party members. Some individual counter-revolutionary party members even dared to violate regulations after registration, concealing the fact from the government and privately relocating. Liu Guilin of Outer District 3, the party secretary of the Kuomintang's Tenth District, fled to Changping County after registering, but was arrested by our local People's Government and sent back to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for punishment.
    This measure of registering counter-revolutionary party members has won the enthusiastic support of the masses. Many people come to the registration office to report information to the staff, expose counter-revolutionary elements, and universally demand severe punishment for counter-revolutionary elements who refuse to register. Many workers and students have asked the government to set a certain deadline for the registration of these counter-revolutionary party members, so that they can bow their heads to the people and repent; those who try to deceive the People's Government and the people with tricks should be severely punished, and they should never be allowed to continue their anti-people sabotage activities.

　　平市反动党团分子
  　两千名已登记
    群众反映情况踊跃检举要求严惩怙恶不悛分子
    【本报讯】本市公安局为彻底肃清反革命残余，巩固革命秩序，于日前召开了各公营企业部门联席会，交流这一时期登记反动党团分子工作经验，以便继续深入开展工作。自七月廿五日开始登记至昨（八月二十一）日止，反动党团分子已分别往各登记处登记者，共达两千余人。各分局、各大企业部门如铁道部、电讯局、邮政管理局、七十兵工厂等，均已展开了深入的宣传动员，首长亲自动手，结合学习进行，铁道部并利用播音机、壁报等各种形式进行宣传，现已有五十人进行了登记，其中有区分部以上的反动党团负责人三十四人，特务分子十六人，经群众检举出来的四百十七人，其负责人登记后交出的反动组织人员名单包括四百三十七人。
    从这一时期登记中，发现一部分反动党团分子对我人民政府采取各种卑鄙无耻手段，企图逃避登记。反动民社党北平市党部负责人李盛朴，我公安分局曾三次通知他来局登记，非但执迷不悟，拒不登记，竟公然进行破坏，带领他全家捣毁我登记处，殴伤我工作员。还有些敌党部负责人及特务分子狡赖，只承认是普通反动党员。个别的反动党派分子胆敢于登记后，不遵照规章，而瞒着政府私自违约迁居。外三区刘桂林是国民党十区部党团书记，登记后私自逃往昌平县，被我当地人民政府逮捕后送回本市公安局惩办。
    登记反动党团分子这一措施，获得了群众的热烈拥护，许多人到登记处找工作员反映情况，检举反动分子，普遍要求对拒不登记的反动分子严加惩办。很多工人、学生要求政府给这些反动党团分子登记定出一定的期限，令其向人民低头，悔过自新；对那些乱耍花枪，企图瞒哄人民政府及人民的反动分子，应严加惩办，绝不容许其继续进行反人民的破坏活动。  　（光）
