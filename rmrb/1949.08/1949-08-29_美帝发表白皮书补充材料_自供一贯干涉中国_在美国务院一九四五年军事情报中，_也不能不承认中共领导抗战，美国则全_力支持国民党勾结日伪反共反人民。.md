Title: US Imperialism Publishes Supplementary Material to White Paper, Confessing Consistent Interference in China. In a 1945 US State Department military intelligence report, it cannot be denied that the CCP led the war against Japan, while the US fully supported the KMT in colluding with Japanese and puppet forces against the Communists and the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, August 28th. To answer the opposition's accusations, the US State Department published a supplement to the White Paper on the 24th of this month, entitled "The Communist Movement in China." This is a military intelligence report from the US government in July 1945, at the end of the Anti-Japanese War. The purpose of the State Department in publishing this intelligence is to prove to the opposition that the US government never mistakenly believed that the Chinese Communist Party was "not a real Communist party," and therefore the US government never befriended the Chinese Communist Party. However, this intelligence cannot but admit that the Chinese Communist Party "is the most tightly organized, most disciplined, and most efficient and constructive group in China," so "the people are turning to the Communist Party," and "many middle parties have also expressed a tendency to cooperate with the Communist Party rather than with the Kuomintang." The intelligence also cannot but admit that the Chinese Communist Party was the main leader of China's Anti-Japanese War, while the Kuomintang government, then located in Chongqing, was not only passively resisting Japan but actively opposing communism, and even "joining the puppet army, attacking the Communist Party with the support of the Japanese army." The intelligence wrote: "In the years after the New Fourth Army Incident, the Chongqing government under the control of the Kuomintang gradually paid attention to the problem of preserving its military power in order to strengthen its domestic position and confront the Communist Party. Because of this purpose, the Chongqing government gradually became unwilling to use its best troops to resist Japan. This situation became particularly obvious after the United States entered the war. In the war zones of East China, the government never stopped confronting the Communist Party. The burden of attacking the Communist Party gradually shifted to the shoulders of the Japanese army and the Chinese puppet government army. Many Chongqing government troops or Kuomintang troops even joined the puppet army, attacking the Communist Party with the support of the Japanese army. Before Japan launched an offensive in China in 1944, there was in fact a truce between the government forces and the Japanese and puppet troops on some battlefields for several years." The intelligence frankly described the then Kuomintang government as "although its military strength is stronger than any independent regime in China, it has lost the support of most of the people." But even so, the US government still "fully supported" the Kuomintang government, and was unwilling to establish military cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party even during the Anti-Japanese War. The intelligence shows that the US government's motive for participating in the "mediation" of the Chinese civil war was merely to effectively support the Kuomintang. The US intelligence absurdly vilified the victory of the Chinese people as "Soviet rule over China," which is obviously the result of the US government observing the world with its own imperialist experience. But the US government admitted that the struggle between the Kuomintang reactionary government and the Chinese people "implied" "the conflict of US-Soviet policy," which is not wrong; because the policy of the US State Department is to support reactionaries in various countries to oppose the people of various countries, while the policy of the Soviet Union is to sympathize with the national independence and people's democratic movements of various countries.

　　美帝发表白皮书补充材料
  　自供一贯干涉中国
    在美国务院一九四五年军事情报中，  也不能不承认中共领导抗战，美国则全  力支持国民党勾结日伪反共反人民。
    【新华社北平二十八日电】美国国务院为了答复反对派的指责，在本月二十四日发表了对于白皮书的一项补充材料，题为“中国的共产党运动”。这是抗日战争末期一九四五年七月美国政府的一项军事情报。国务院发表这个情报的目的，是在向反对派证明，美国政府从未误认中国共产党“不是真正的共产党”，因此美国政府从来没有和中国共产党做过朋友。但是这个情报不能不承认中国共产党“在中国是政治组织最严密，纪律最良好，具有最强大效率及建设性之团体”，因此“人民都投向共产党一方面”，“许多中间党派也表示出宁愿与共产党合作，而不愿与国民党合作的趋势”。情报也不能不承认，中国共产党是中国抗日战争的主要领导者，而当时设在重庆的国民党政府则不但消极抗日，积极反共，甚至“参加伪军，在日军的支持下攻击共产党”。情报写道：“在新四军事件以后的几年内，国民党控制下的重庆政府，逐渐注意到保全其军事力量的问题，以便加强其在国内的地位而对抗共产党。由于这个目的，重庆政府便逐渐不愿以其最好的部队用于抵抗日本。自从美国参战以后，这种情形变得特别明显。在华东各战区内，政府从未停止对抗共产党。攻击共产党的负担并逐渐转移到日军和中国伪政府军队的肩上。许多重庆政府的军队或者国民党的部队甚至参加伪军，在日军的支持下攻击共产党。在日本于一九四四年开始在中国发动攻势以前，在若干战场上，政府军和日伪军间事实上存在着一种休战状态达若干年之久。”情报坦白地描写当时的国民党政府“尽管其军事力量较中国的任何独立政权为强，然而它已失去了大部分人民的支持”。但是虽然如此，美国政府仍然“全力支持”国民党政府，而对于中国共产党即在抗日战争期间也不愿建立军事合作关系。情报表明美国政府一度参加“调处”中国内战的动机仅仅是为着有效地支持国民党。美国的情报荒谬地把中国人民的胜利诬称为“苏联统治中国”，这显然是美国政府用自己的帝国主义经验来观察世界的结果。但是美国政府承认国民党反动政府与中国人民之间的斗争“隐含”着“美苏政策的冲突”这一点并没有说错；因为美国国务院的政策是支持各国反动派以反对各国人民，而苏联的政策则是同情各国人民的民族独立和人民民主运动。
