　　Beijing-Wuhu Railway Subgrade Washed Away
　　Repaired and Reopened
    [Nanjing People's Broadcasting Station, 14th Broadcast] The Beijing-Wuhu Railway has resumed operation. Two sections of the roadbed on this line were washed out by water last month. One section has now been repaired; the other section cannot be worked on temporarily due to the materials not having arrived yet. In order to guarantee transportation, the Railway Bureau has used a relay method at both ends, and the entire line has resumed operation on the 12th of this month.

    【南京人民广播电台十四日广播】京芜铁路已恢复通车。该路上月有两处路基被水冲成缺口。现已修好一处；另一处因材料还没到达，暂时无法工作。路局为了保证交通运输，利用两头接替方式，本月十二日已全线恢复通车。
