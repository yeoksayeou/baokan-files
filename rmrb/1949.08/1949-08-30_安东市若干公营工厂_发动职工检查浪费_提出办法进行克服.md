Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 28th: Several public enterprises in Andong City, Northeast China, conducted a mass waste inspection campaign in July. They are now beginning to systematically overcome waste phenomena based on the inspection results, and have prepared favorable conditions for the future implementation of scientific management in these enterprises. This campaign was led by the Liaodong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and widely mobilized the participation of workers, so the inspection of waste phenomena was quite thorough. Before the inspection began, each factory successively convened party branch meetings, factory management committee meetings, worker representative meetings, and general worker meetings to carry out extensive mobilization and deliberation. Then, from inside the Party to outside the Party, from leaders to workers, they extensively promoted democracy for inspection and proposed methods to overcome waste.

In this campaign, the Andong No. 1 Paper Mill had a relatively broad and in-depth scope of inspection. The factory conducted detailed research on every detail from the purchase of raw materials, material storage, and mechanical equipment to the production process. The workers proposed 419 instances of waste phenomena and improvement methods. According to the factory's inspection results, waste was mainly manifested in three aspects: First, waste generated due to lax management and inspection during the production process. For example, the loss of pulp flowing out with the wastewater during papermaking was 284 catties per day, which could be made into one piece of paper (equal to one-quarter of a ton), worth 30 million Northeast currency. Second, waste caused by unreasonable mechanical equipment. For example, when the wood-cutting room used a thick circular saw to saw wood, it sawed 100 cubic meters of wood per day, and the sawdust was 8 cubic meters. If another saw was used, the loss could be reduced by 4 cubic meters. Third, waste in material storage and procurement. The factory had successively rotted 200 bundles of reeds; the woolen cloth was bitten by rats, resulting in a loss of 1.5 million Northeast currency; when buying gasoline, they failed to check carefully, and later found that a barrel was full of water, etc. In total, the waste loss caused by irresponsible storage and purchasing and other accidents amounted to 689 million Northeast currency in this inspection.

Among the suggestions made by the factory workers, 173 could be resolved immediately, and have now been dealt with separately, such as improving the system, changing the electrical switches, and adjusting the use of electric roller horsepower. Among them, the modification of unreasonable electrical equipment alone saves an average of 600 horsepower per day compared to before, saving 2.96 million Northeast currency. Some suggestions, such as transforming machines, building workshops, and adding equipment, need to be gradually improved. Plans have now been made, solutions and completion times have been determined, and a inspection committee composed of the factory's Party branch, administration, and trade union has been jointly formed to supervise the administration to complete the above plans on schedule.

After half a month of inspection, the Guanghua Needle Factory also found that the waste in various aspects in half a year amounted to more than 350 million Northeast currency. The main reason for the waste was that the administrative leaders lacked production experience and failed to conduct in-depth inspections, resulting in low quality, high costs, and difficulty in sales, resulting in the freezing of funds as high as 650 million Northeast currency. The factory has now begun to strengthen the leadership of the factory management committee and is also preparing to establish a technical research class to strictly check production records in order to make more reasonable quota standards. After inspecting the waste of power and excessive defective products, the Third Textile Factory has also begun to formulate methods to correct them.

　　安东市若干公营工厂
  　发动职工检查浪费
  　提出办法进行克服
    【新华社沈阳二十八日电】东北安东市的若干公营企业七月份曾进行了一次群众性的检查浪费运动，现正根据检查结果开始有计划有步骤地进行克服浪费现象，并给今后各该企业实行科学管理准备了有利条件。这一运动是由中共辽东省委会的领导并广泛地发动职工群众参加的，因此对浪费现象的检查相当彻底。各厂在检查开始前，曾先后召开厂内共产党支部大会、工厂管委会、职工代表会以及全体工人大会进行了广泛的动员和酝酿，然后便由党内到党外，从领导人员到工人，广泛发扬民主进行检查，并提出克服浪费的办法。在这次运动中，以安东第一造纸厂检查的范围较广，也较深入。该厂从采购原料、物资保管、机械设备直到生产过程中的每个细节，都进行了详细研究，经工人提出的浪费现象和改进办法，即有四百一十九条。据该厂检查结果，浪费主要表现在三方面：一是在生产过程中管理检查不严格而产生的浪费。如抄纸时随下水流出的纸浆损失每天有二百八十四斤，可制成一件纸（等于四分之一吨），值三千万东北币。二是机械设备不合理造成的浪费。如削木室用厚圆锯锯木，每天锯一百立方公尺木料，木屑就有八立方公尺，如用另外的锯则可减少损失四立方公尺。三是物资保管与采购上的浪费。该厂曾先后烂掉二百捆芦苇；毛布被老鼠咬破，损失达东北币一百五十万元；买汽油时疏于检查，以后发现一桶全是水等等。总计由于保管采买不负责任及其他事故而产生的浪费损失，在这次检查中就查出有六亿八千九百万元。在该厂工人所提的建议中，可以立即解决的有一百七十三条，现已分别处理完毕，如改进制度，改变电气开关，调整电滚马力的使用等。其中仅改装不合理的电气设备一项，每天平均即较前省电六百马力，节省东北币二百九十六万元。有些建议如改造机器、修建工房、增加设备等须逐步改进者，现已做出计划，确定了解决办法和完成时间；并由厂内中共支部、行政和工会联合组成检查委员会，负责监督行政按期完成上述计划。光华制针厂经过半个月的检查，也发现半年中各方面的浪费约达东北币三亿五千多万元，造成浪费的主要原因是行政领导人员生产经验不足，又未进行深入检查，致造成质量低，成本高，推销困难，因而冻结资金达东北币六亿五千万元之巨。现该厂已开始加强工厂管委会的领导，同时准备成立技术研究班，严格检查生产记录，以便作出较合理的定额标准。第三纺织厂在检查动力的浪费和废品过多等现象后，亦已开始订出办法，进行纠正。
