Now, except for the remote mountainous areas of Badong, Enshi, Wufeng and other nine counties in southwestern Hubei, where remnants of bandits are entrenched, all the remaining fifty-six county towns in Hubei Province (excluding the six counties of Yunyang and others in northwestern Hubei that are temporarily under the jurisdiction of southern Shaanxi) have been completely liberated. In the above battles, the Liberation Army captured a total of more than 430 enemy personnel including Cui Guozhang, the commander of the Nanxian Self-Defense Corps, seized one 60mm mortar, five heavy machine guns, fifteen light machine guns, and 198 rifles and short guns.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 12th: A unit of the Henan People's Liberation Army pursued and suppressed the Ren Xiaotu bandit gang in Xichuan, southwestern Henan, and completely crushed it in northern Neixiang. More than 400 people including Wang Zhixian, the deputy division commander of the bandit gang, surrendered to the Liberation Army, and another part of the bandits were captured. The Liberation Army seized more than 420 rifles and short guns. Ren Xiaotu was originally a major bandit in the Xichuan area, and was later reorganized into the New Third Division by the Hu bandit Zongnan.
