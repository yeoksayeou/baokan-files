Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 6th. As the Chiang Kai-shek and Bai Chongxi bandit troops fled westward along the Nanchang-to-Pingxiang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, they extensively damaged railway bridges and other transportation facilities. From Qingjiang in western Jiangxi to Luxi in eastern Pingxiang, as many as fifteen bridges of various types were destroyed. The Jieshou and Fenyi railway stations were completely burned down, and the water towers, houses, and sheds of the Xinyu and Yichun stations were almost entirely destroyed. The two large bridges in Yichun and Xinyu cities spanning the Yuanshui River were also blown up. When the bandit troops blew up the bridges, they injured and stunned many local residents.
