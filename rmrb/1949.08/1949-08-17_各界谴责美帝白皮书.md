　　【Our Newspaper Exclusive】The American imperialists' publication of the "United States Relations with China" White Paper exposes their consistent aggressive face in invading our country and interfering in our internal affairs. It also exposes their ugly face of continuing to harm the Chinese people, organizing spy networks, and妄想 "overthrowing" the Chinese people's regime, arousing anger and condemnation from people from all walks of life. Yesterday, Guo Moruo, Chairman of the National Committee of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Mao Dun, Vice Chairman, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the National Committee of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, Jiang Nanxiang, Deputy Secretary of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, Xie Bangding of the All-China Students' Federation, and others successively issued statements, excerpts of which are as follows:

　　Guo Moruo said
　　American Imperialism's White Paper Exposes a Grand Conspiracy

　　Americans like to consider themselves the world's number one, and they are indeed the world's number one in terms of stupidity and brutality. The White Paper, like a kidney patient's, recently published by the U.S. government is a good proof of being world number one. The U.S. government has adopted the Japanese invaders' method of "using Chinese to control Chinese," aiding the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek, trying to turn China into a single colony of the United States. After spending hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars and working for five years, the result was a complete defeat. The United States became the arsenal of the People's Liberation Army, and Chiang Kai-shek became the transportation captain. The White Paper was published specifically to cover up this failure, but the more it is covered up, the more obvious it becomes, not only exposing all the past crimes, but also revealing the entire future conspiracy. What is the conspiracy for the future? It is to have no intention of repenting of the past crimes, and to continue to use the reactionaries and so-called "democratic individualists" to make trouble with the people's China to the end. Therefore, the publication of this White Paper is a good thing for us, allowing friends who are generally regarded as "democratic individualists" to recognize the truth of American imperialism more clearly. Of course, the content of the White Paper will not be the entirety of the truth, and it has undoubtedly been embellished and abridged. But it is already enough. The hideous face of American imperialism is only covered with a layer of veil. The most interesting thing is that it is helpless about the situation in China, but unwilling to give up; it intends to make trouble to the end, but it openly declares it; it has invaded China and many other countries, and it is at ease, but it says that if China invades its neighbors in the future, it will be "violating the principles of the United Nations Charter and threatening international peace and security." A bully talking about benevolence and righteousness, and a prodigal son talking about chastity, is both hateful and hilarious. But for those friends who still have illusions about the United States, the "democratic individualists," they should understand today. Please see, isn't the U.S. government's stupidity and brutality the world's number one? After spending five years and hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars to support Chiang Kai-shek, it was all in vain. Today, the power of the Chinese people is so strong, but it is still preparing to find a second and third Chiang Kai-shek, and preparing to write a second and third White Paper. Okay, as long as the U.S. government is happy, let it write a few more White Papers, but we Chinese people cannot allow a second Chiang Kai-shek!

　　Mao Dun said
　　"Middle Roaders" Receive a Head-on Blow

　　I have only seen the summary of the White Paper, but in this summary, it can already be seen: (1) The U.S. government itself confesses how it has tried its best in the past five years, through the tool of Chiang Kai-shek, to attack the Chinese people; (2) American Imperialism also confesses that its attack on the Chinese people has failed, and the Kuomintang reactionaries are a helpless and incurable leper dog. However, American Imperialism's ambition to enslave the Chinese people is unwilling to stop there. The White Paper openly declares that American Imperialism will use all methods to assist all local reactionary forces within China, continue to be enemies with the Chinese people. These methods include organizing armed rebellions, economic sabotage, etc. (3) American Imperialism also places its hopes on the so-called supporters of "democratic individualism." Who are the so-called supporters of China's "democratic individualism" in the eyes of American Imperialism? To be honest, they are the "middle roaders" that Stuart Leighton was thinking about a year ago. The White Paper is said to be more than a thousand pages long, but its "essence" is probably no more than the above three points. The White Paper completely exposes the hideous face of American Imperialism, who wants to possess China at any cost. This is truly a head-on blow to some Chinese people who still have illusions about American Imperialism; the White Paper also attempts to intimidate the Chinese people, but the Chinese people cannot be intimidated. The White Paper can truly be compared with Japan's "Tanaka Memorial." Japanese imperialism did not publicly publish the "Tanaka Memorial," but American Imperialism publicly published the White Paper. From this, it can be seen the extent of American Imperialism's arrogance and greed, but it also shows how frantic American Imperialism is after failing to attack the Chinese people. The Chinese people are confident in crushing any conspiracy of American Imperialism to enslave China.

　　Liao Chengzhi said
　　Answering the Despicable Challenge with Practical Actions

　　Chinese youth, united under the banner of New Democracy, are irreconcilable with American Imperialism, the number one enemy of mankind in the world. Acheson's White Paper only exposes its hideous face to the vast number of Chinese youth once again. The awakened progressive youth will thereby more clearly draw the line between ourselves and the enemy, forever follow Mao Zedong forward, struggle to completely eradicate the poisonous influence of American Imperialism in all aspects of politics, economy, culture, art, and religion, and consolidate China's people's democratic dictatorship on this basis. All the youth who have had illusions about American Imperialism in the past should draw lessons from this, deeply alert themselves, self-reflect, and should be determined to completely cut ties with American Imperialism in thought and in all aspects. If anyone insists on being a "democratic individualist," then wouldn't you become a comrade of American Imperialism?
　　I believe that the Chinese youth who are anti-imperialist, anti-feudalist, and anti-bureaucratic capitalist will answer this despicable challenge with practical actions! Chinese youth will answer in this way:
　　"Acheson, take your illusions as a sacrifice for American Imperialism and hold them tight! Chinese youth who are anti-imperialist, anti-feudalist, and anti-bureaucratic capitalist will resolutely carry the Chinese people's great revolution to the end, and unite with the vast number of democratic youth in your country to fight for the burial of your American Imperialism!"

　　Jiang Nanxiang said
　　American Imperialism is a Fierce Enemy

　　The White Paper recently published by the United States is a self-confessed confession after American Imperialism's despicable creation of the Chinese civil war and interference in China's internal affairs met with a shameful and irredeemable failure. This confession is very useful for the Chinese people. It makes the Chinese people more clearly aware that American imperialists, whether in the past, present, or future, are the most ferocious enemies of the Chinese people.
　　China's advanced youth have always stood at the forefront of anti-imperialism. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, Chinese youth, together with the Chinese people, defeated Japanese imperialism. During the three-year People's Liberation War, Chinese youth, together with the Chinese people, defeated American imperialism, which used Chiang Kai-shek to invade China. In the future, we have full confidence that, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese youth, together with the Chinese people, will continue to smash any conspiracies and tricks of American imperialism, just like in the past.
　　What deserves our vigilance is that after American imperialism ran into a wall in front of the Chinese people, it still places its hopes on China's "democratic individualists," and wants to encourage and support them to oppose the Chinese people's democratic regime. In order to block any air-raid shelters that can be drilled into by American imperialists, Chinese youth should unite closely with the Chinese people under the banner of New Democracy, remove all illusions about American imperialism, abandon the third route, resolutely support the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class (through the Communist Party) and based on the worker and peasant alliance, and stand on the side of the world's peace and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union, vowing to fight American imperialism, which hates the Chinese people and invades the Chinese people, to the end.

　　Xie Bangding said
　　Students Nationwide Rise Up and Fight American Imperialism to the End

　　When the likes of Marshall and Stuart Leighton, who came to China to implement the American Imperialist policy of aggression, were still wearing the mask of hypocrites, attempting to deceive the Chinese and American people, our vast number of students nationwide did not have the slightest illusion about American Imperialism, and resolutely launched a series of struggles against American Imperialism's interference in China's internal affairs, protesting against the atrocities of the U.S. military in China, opposing American Imperialism's support for Japan, and opposing American Imperialism's running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries. Now, in the victorious situation of the Chinese revolution, the White Paper published by American Imperialism has finally shamelessly confessed its crimes of invading China, making us recognize its ugly face even more clearly. Although it helplessly admits its failure in the White Paper, it is still unwilling to accept the victory of the Chinese people. Our students across the country must be vigilant against any conspiracies and sabotage of American Imperialism. At the same time, we must strengthen our unity, under the leadership of the Communist Party, to defend our solemn and beautiful motherland, and fight American Imperialism to the end.
　　We want to warn American Imperialism: When you continue to stick your pig snout into the new Chinese garden, Chinese students are willing to remind you that you will actually enjoy the words that Stuart Leighton used to scare Chinese students last year: "You must be prepared to face the consequences of your actions."

　　各界谴责美帝白皮书
    【本报专访】美帝发表“中美关系”白皮书，暴露了一贯的侵略我国，干涉我国内政的狰狞面目，又暴露了继续危害中国人民，组织间谍网，妄想“推翻”中国人民政权的丑恶面貌，引起各界人民的愤怒和谴责，昨日，中华全国文学艺术界联合会全国委员会主席郭沫若、副主席茅盾，中华全国民主青年联合会全国委员会主席廖承志，中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会副书记蒋南翔，中华全国学生联合会谢邦定等先后发表谈话，兹摘要如下：
    郭沫若说
    美帝白皮书暴露大阴谋
    美国人喜欢自居世界第一，在愚蠢而又横暴这一点上，倒的确是世界第一，最近美国政府所发表的肾脏病患者一样的白皮书，便是一个世界第一的好证明。美国政府袭取了日寇“以华制华”的办法，援助反动派蒋介石，想把中国弄成美国单一的殖民地。费了几十万万美元，搞了五年，结果是一败涂地，美国成了人民解放军的兵工厂，蒋介石成了运输队长。白皮书便是专为掩盖这一失败而发表的，然而愈掩盖却愈昭彰，不仅供出了以往的整个罪恶，而且暴露了今后的全盘阴谋。今后的阴谋是什么呢？便是丝毫也不想悔改以往的罪恶，依然要利用反动派与所谓“民主的个人主义者”来和人民中国捣乱到底。因此有这一白皮书的发表，对于我们倒是一件好事，让一般被视为“民主的个人主义者”的朋友把美帝国主义的真相可以认得更清楚一些。当然，白皮书的内容，并不会是真相的全部，那无疑是已经经过粉饰和节削的。然而已经够了。美帝的狰狞面貌仅只罩着一层面纱了。最有趣味的是：它把中国的情势无可奈何，却又死不甘心；存心捣乱到底，却又公开表明；侵略了中国和其它许多国家，自己处之泰然，却又说今后中国假如要侵略邻邦，则是“违反联合国宪章的原则，并威胁国际和平与安全的局面。”恶霸谈仁义，荡子说贞操，令人愤恨，也令人喷饭。但对美国假如多少还存有幻想的“民主的个人主义者”的朋友们，今天总可以明白了吧。请看，美国政府的愚蠢而又横暴，到底是不是世界第一呢？费了五年工夫，花了几十万万美元来扶助蒋介石，全不抵事，今天中国人民力量如此壮大了，却还要准备找第二第三的蒋介石，准备写第二第三的白皮书。好的，只要美国政府高兴，就让它多写几部白皮书吧，可我们中国人民却不能容许再有蒋介石第二了！
    茅盾说
    “中间路线者”挨了当头一棒
    白皮书只看到摘要，然而在这摘要中，已经可以看出：（一）美国政府自己招供了过去五年中间如何竭尽全力，通过蒋介石这个工具，向中国人民进攻；（二）美帝又自己招供，它向中国人民的进攻是失败了，国民党反动派是扶不起的癞狗，无可救药了，但美帝奴役中国人民的野心是不肯就此收歇的，白皮书公然宣称，美帝要以一切方法援助中国境内的一切地方反动势力，继续和中国人民为敌，这一切方法包括组织武装叛乱，经济破坏等等。（三）美帝又把它的希望寄托在所谓“民主个人主义”的拥护者。美帝心目中的所谓中国的“民主个人主义”的拥护者是些什么人呢？老实说，就是一年前司徒雷登所念念不忘、眉挑目引的“中间路线者”。白皮书据说有一千余页之多，可是它的“精髓”大概不外乎上述三点。白皮书把美帝欲得中国而甘心的狰狞面目完全暴露了，这对于中国的一部分对美帝尚存幻想的人们，真是当头一棒；白皮书还企图恐吓中国人民，不过中国人民是吓不倒的。白皮书真可与日本的“田中奏摺”媲美，日本帝国主义不曾把“田中奏摺”公然发表，美帝却把白皮书公然发表了，由此可见美帝的狂妄与贪狠到了如何程度，但亦可见美帝进攻中国人民失败以后如何的暴跳失措。中国人民是有把握粉碎美帝的奴役中国的任何阴谋诡计的。
    廖承志说
    以实际的行动来回答可鄙的挑战
    在新民主主义的旗帜下团结起来的中国青年，是和世界人类第一号公敌美帝国主义誓不两立的。艾奇逊的白皮书，只是向中国广大青年再一次的暴露了它的狰狞面目。已经觉悟了的进步青年，将由此更明确地划清敌我界限，永远追随着毛泽东前进，为彻底根绝美帝国主义的政治、经济、文化、艺术、宗教等各方面的毒害影响而斗争，并以此为基础来巩固中国的人民民主专政。过去对于美帝国主义存有幻想的一切青年，都应由此得出教训，深自警惕，躬自反省，并应该由此痛下决心，从思想到各方面，与美帝国主义干脆完全绝缘。假使谁要坚持作一个“民主的个人主义者”那你岂不就成了美帝国主义的同志了吗？
    我相信反帝国主义，反封建主义，反官僚资本主义的中国青年，将以实际行动来回答这可鄙的挑战！中国青年将这样回答：
    “艾奇逊，将你的幻想做为美帝国主义的殉葬品，好好抱着吧！中国反帝国主义，反封建主义，反官僚资本主义的青年，将坚决地将中国人民大革命进行到底，并和你们国内的广大民主青年，团结在一起，为葬送你们美帝国主义而斗争”！
    蒋南翔说
    美帝国主义是凶恶敌人
    美国最近发表的白皮书，是美帝国主义卑鄙地制造中国内战，干涉中国内政的罪恶政策，遭遇到了可耻的无可挽救的失败以后的一篇不打自招的供状。这篇供状对于中国人民是很有用处的，它使中国人民更清楚地知道了：美帝国主义者，无论在过去现在和将来，都是中国人民最凶恶的敌人。
    中国先进青年，一向站在反帝的前列，八年抗战，中国青年和中国人民在一起，打败了日本帝国主义，三年人民解放战争，中国青年和中国人民在一起，打败了利用蒋介石侵略中国的美帝国主义。今后我们有充分自信，在中国共产党的领导下，中国青年和中国人民，将会象过去一样继续粉碎美帝国主义的任何阴谋鬼计。
    值得我们警惕的：美帝国主义在中国人民面前碰壁之后，还寄希望于中国的“民主的个人主义者”，要鼓励与支持他们，反对中国人民的民主政权。为了堵塞任何可以为美帝国主义者钻入的防空洞，中国青年应与中国人民在一起，紧紧地团结在新民主主义的旗帜下，去除对美帝国主义的任何幻想，抛却第三条路线，坚决地拥护以工人阶级（经过共产党）为领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，站在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的一边，誓与仇视中国人民侵略中国人民的美帝国主义斗争到底。
    谢邦定说
    全国学生起来和美帝斗争到底
    当来华执行美帝侵略政策的马歇尔、司徒雷登之流还戴着伪善者的假面具，企图欺骗中美人民的时候，我们全国广大学生即对美帝不存丝毫的幻想，坚决掀起了反对美帝干涉中国内政，抗议美军在华暴行，反对美帝扶植日本及反对美帝走狗国民党反动派的一连串的斗争。现在，在中国革命的胜利形势下，美帝国主义所发表的白皮书终于公然厚颜无耻地供出了自己侵华的罪状，使我们更认清楚了它丑恶的面目。虽然它在白皮书中无可奈何地承认了自己的失败，但它对中国人民的胜利是还不肯甘心。我们全国同学必须警惕美帝国主义的任何阴谋和破坏，同时，必须加紧团结，在共产党领导之下，为保卫我们庄严美丽的祖国，和美帝国主义斗争到底。
    我们要警告美帝国主义：在你们继续要把猪嘴巴拱到新中国花园里来的时候，中国学生愿意提醒你们，你们将要实际享受到司徒雷登去年吓吓中国学生的那句话“你们必须准备面对你们的行动的后果”。
