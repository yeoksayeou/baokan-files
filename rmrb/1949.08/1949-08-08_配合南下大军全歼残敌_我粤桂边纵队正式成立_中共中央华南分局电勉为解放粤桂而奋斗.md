Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 7th: The People's Liberation Army Guangdong-Guangxi Border Column was officially established on August 1st under orders. The Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission appointed Liang Guang as the Commander and Political Commissar of the Column, Tang Caiyou as Deputy Commander, Mo Xun as Deputy Political Commissar, Yang Yingbin as Chief of Staff, and Wen Zhuohua as Director of the Political Department. The People's Liberation Army Guangdong-Guangxi Border Column was developed and strengthened from the people's guerrilla forces that persisted in anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in the Guangdong-Guangxi border area six years ago. Over the past six years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, relying on the people of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, under extremely difficult conditions, the column has been active in the Leizhou Peninsula in southwestern Guangdong, Qinzhou, Lingshan, Hepu and other places, as well as Laibin, Wuxuan, Qianjiang, Shanglin, Yongchun, Hengxian, Guixian, Beiliu, Bobai, Luchuan counties in southeastern Guangxi, and the Shiwandashan area at the junction of the two Guang provinces, persisting in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the People's Liberation War. It has continuously developed and grown in battle, created its main force, and laid the foundation for establishing revolutionary base areas in the border area and welcoming the victory of the liberation of Guangdong and Guangxi. In its founding declaration, the column stated that it would resolutely implement Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's advance order of April 21st and the People's Liberation Army's Eight Points of Attention, resolutely support the New Political Consultative Conference and the democratic coalition government about to be established, coordinate with the southward army, resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly and completely annihilate all reactionary troops refusing to surrender, and be prepared to sign local agreements with all Kuomintang local governments and military groups within Guangdong and Guangxi willing to accept the domestic peace agreement and its final amendment.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 7th: The Central China Sub-Bureau of the CCP recently sent a telegram congratulating the establishment of the People's Liberation Army Guangdong-Guangxi Border Column. The telegram reads as follows: "Comrade Liang Guang, transferred to all commanders and fighters of the Guangdong-Guangxi Border Column: In the three years of the People's Liberation War, the military and civilians of the Guangdong-Guangxi border area, due to their resolute implementation of the wise strategic policies and various policies of our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, have not only defended their own area and developed their own strong forces, but also helped the development of the Guangdong Central Liberation struggle, making great contributions to the liberation struggle of the two Guang provinces. Now that the column has been officially established, we hope that you will make persistent efforts, coordinate with the southward army, and strive for the liberation of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces."
