Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 10th: The first foreign ministers' conference of the so-called "Council of Europe," instigated and organized by the US-British bloc, began on the 8th in Strasbourg, northeastern France. According to the proposed charter, the "Council of Europe" includes two components: a foreign ministers' conference and a "European Parliament." The inaugural meeting of the so-called "European Parliament" will be held in Strasbourg immediately after the foreign ministers' conference. Representatives from ten countries, including Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Ireland, are participating in the first meeting of the foreign ministers. Representatives from Greece and Turkey may join later. The foreign ministers' conference is being held in secret. The agenda includes discussing the report on the "Charter of the Council of Europe" drafted by the Council of Europe's preparatory committee, which was formulated in London this May. The outcome of the foreign ministers' conference will be reported to the "European Parliament," whose function is limited to discussing issues approved by the foreign ministers' conference.

The Soviet Red Navy newspaper, commenting on the Council of Europe, pointed out: The Council of Europe was established based on the so-called "United Europe" movement organized by Churchill. This movement is essentially part of the imperialists' expansionist plan. Under the guise of "uniting" European countries, the US-British reactionary bloc and its lackeys in Europe are trying to undermine the sovereignty of small countries, seize their independence, and reduce them to pawns, in order to turn the western part of the European continent into the fiefdom of US-British monopoly capital. Propagating the bourgeois concept of cosmopolitanism, denying the concept of the motherland, corrupting and deceiving the masses—this is the purpose of the Council of Europe. The thoroughly reactionary concept of a "United Europe" immediately took organizational form after the US State Department announced the draft of the North Atlantic Treaty. The Council of Europe, like the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty, serves the purpose of struggling against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The Council of Europe is a kind of supplement to the North Atlantic aggressive treaty and a link connecting countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty with countries outside the treaty. The Marshall Plan, the Western European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty, and the Council of Europe are all links in the same chain. Behind different labels lies the same desire: to use the economic, military, and human resources of Western European countries to prepare for new aggression. However, the people of these countries do not want to sacrifice their sovereignty for the insane plan of world domination embraced by American imperialism.

    “欧洲委员会”是什么？
    美帝扩张计划的一部分
    北大西洋公约的补充物
    【新华社北平十日电】美英集团策动组织的所谓“欧洲委员会”的第一次外长会议，已于八日起在法国东北部的斯特拉斯堡城举行。按照拟议中的章程，“欧洲委员会”包括外长会议与“欧洲议会”两个组成部分。所谓“欧洲议会”的首届会议，将紧接外长会议之后在斯特拉斯堡召开。参加外长会议首次会议的，有英、法、意、比、荷、卢、挪、丹、瑞典和爱尔兰等十国的代表。希脑和土耳其的代表，可能在稍后参加。外长会议秘密举行，该会之议程中包括讨论“欧洲委员会”筹委会所拟关于“欧洲委员会章程”的报告，这一“章程”于今年五月在伦敦拟就。外长会议讨论的结果，将向“欧洲议会”提出报告，这一所谓“议会”的职能，仅限于讨论外长会议所批准的各项问题。苏联红海军报于评论欧洲委员会时指出：欧洲委员会是以邱吉尔组织的所谓“统一欧洲”运动为基础而建立的。这个运动实质上就是帝国主义者的扩张主义计划的一部分。在“联合”欧洲国家的伪装下，美英反动集团及其在欧洲的仆从，力图破坏小国的主权，争夺他们的独立，把他们降低到小卒的地位，以便把欧洲大陆的西部变成美英独占资本的封土。宣传资产阶级的世界主义概念，否认祖国的概念，败坏和欺骗群众，这就是欧洲委员会的目的。彻底反动的“统一欧洲”概念，在美国国务院公布北大西洋公约草案后，立即具有了组织形式。欧洲委员会也象西欧联盟和北大西洋公约一样，是服务于反对苏联和人民民主国家之斗争的目的的。欧洲委员会是北大西洋侵略公约的某种补充物，而且是联结参加北大西洋公约的国家与公约以外的国家的环节。马歇尔计划、西欧联盟、北大西洋公约和欧洲委员会，都是一条链子上的环节。在不同的招牌后面，掩藏着同一的愿望，这就是使用西欧国家的经济、军事和人力的富源，来准备新的侵略。但是，这些国家的人民，并不想为美国帝国主义所怀抱的世界统治的疯人计划，而牺牲他们的主权。
