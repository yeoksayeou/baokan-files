Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 30th: U.S. imperialism is intensifying its conspiracy to annex Taiwan Province, a territory of China, in order to openly transform Taiwan into an American colony and use it as a base for further aggression against mainland China. According to a Reuters dispatch from Hong Kong on the 27th, citing the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao, the United States has formally notified the Kuomintang government that it intends to take over Taiwan as part of the U.S. occupation zone in the Pacific. Wu Tiecheng discussed this matter with MacArthur while in Japan, but no definite conclusion has been reached. Agence France-Presse also transmitted similar news from London on the 27th. The dispatch cited a report by Mackenzie, the London correspondent of The Sunday Times, saying that rumors are rampant in Guangzhou that the U.S. government, in a note to Li Zongren, suggested placing Taiwan under Allied military control, meaning that General MacArthur would take over Taiwan. The dispatch also quoted sources from the American side in London as saying: MacArthur has been given broad discretionary powers, and he may even take over Taiwan first, and then try to explain the "legal justification" for this action. Prior to this, United Press International Washington on the 6th disclosed that senior American diplomatic and military experts are trying to decide whether the United States should take action to "save" strategically important Taiwan, and military figures insist on taking direct action on Taiwan—"occupation" or other actions. In addition, it is particularly noteworthy that U.S. Secretary of State Acheson spoke at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. United Press International Washington on the 12th reported: "It is said that Acheson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that although Taiwan has been added to the territory of China, technically speaking, Taiwan is still Japanese territory before the signing of the peace treaty with Japan."

　　妄图继续侵略中国大陆
  　美帝阴谋吞并台湾
    【新华社北平三十日电】美帝国主义正加紧进行吞并中国领土台湾省的阴谋活动，以便将台湾公开变成美国殖民地，并作为美国继续侵略中国大陆的基地。据路透社香港二十七日电引香港大公报消息说：美国已正式通知国民党政府，说它想接管台湾作为太平洋美国占领区的一部分。吴铁城在日本时已与麦克阿瑟讨论此事，但尚无肯定的结果。法新社伦敦二十七日电也传出同样消息，该电引证星期泰晤士报驻伦敦记者麦坎兹的报道说：广州方面盛传美国政府在致李宗仁的照会中建议将台湾置于盟国军事管制之下，此即或谓麦克阿瑟元帅将接管台湾。该电并引证伦敦美国方面人士的话说：麦克阿瑟已被赋予广大的处置权，他甚至可能先接管台湾，然后再设法说明此一行动的“合法理由”。在此以前，合众社华盛顿六日消息即曾披露：美国高级外交与军事专家正试图决定美国是否应采取行动以“拯救”战略性的台湾，军界人士坚持对台湾采取直接的行动——“占领”或其他行动。此外，特别值得注意的是美国务卿艾奇逊在美参院外委会上的讲话，合众社华盛顿十二日电称：“据传，艾奇逊曾告参院外委会称，台湾虽已加到中国的领土上，但在技术上讲，在对日和约签订前台湾仍是日本领土。”
