    [This newspaper's dispatch] To strengthen the investigation of water conservancy conditions in various parts of North China and prepare for large-scale irrigation projects, the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government specially gathered more than sixty technicians in late July to form five water conservancy survey teams and surveying teams for Chahar, Suiyuan, Pingyuan, Changli (Eastern Hebei), and Bagezhuang (Eastern Hebei). Nine technical cadres were also transferred from the Shijin Canal Irrigation Project Office to participate in the survey work. After completing the necessary preparations, the Chahar, Suiyuan, Pingyuan, and Changli survey teams departed from Pingjin around the 7th of this month, heading to their respective work locations in Dongyang, Yuhe, Sanggan River in Chahar Province, Fengzhen in Suiyuan, Dong'a in Pingyuan, and Changli in Eastern Hebei. They have all arrived and started working. The Bagezhuang survey team will also depart from Tianjin within the next few days. It is expected that all survey and measurement work will be completed before the end of October. The measurement scope includes 700,000 mu of siltation and irrigation projects in Chahar Province; 320,000 mu of alkaline wasteland in Bagezhuang, which is to be fully developed into paddy fields; complete restoration of 70,000 mu of abandoned paddy fields in Qilihai, Changli; a trial canal irrigation project is planned on the north bank of the Yellow River in Dong'a, Pingyuan Province; the Suiyuan survey team is preparing to conduct a general survey of water conservancy in various counties in eastern Suiyuan and assist the masses in opening and repairing small canals. Currently, in addition to surveying the Qilihai irrigation project, the Changli survey team is actively assisting the masses in Changli County in blocking breaches and preventing floods, and is cooperating with the Luan River Headquarters in river management work.

Accompanied by comrades Yan Yiqing, Zhang Huayi, and Li Weizhi from the Agricultural Department, they departed from Pingjin on the 8th, dividing into two groups for on-site inspections. One group went directly to Dong'a County, Pingyuan Province, to inspect the Yellow River water conservancy, and has already telegraphed the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission to send people to participate in jointly studying the issue of opening canals in Aishan and Weishan to draw water from the Yellow River for irrigation. The other group first went to Shimen to inspect the Shijin Canal irrigation project and guide the design of the Huangbizhuang permanent dam, and then went to Shanxi to inspect the Fen River water conservancy, collect relevant data, and study the construction of a dam in Pingyao to develop large-scale siltation and irrigation projects. The inspection team's trip is scheduled to last three weeks. (Xu Da)
