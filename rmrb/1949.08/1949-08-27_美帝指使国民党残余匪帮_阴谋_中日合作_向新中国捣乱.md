　　American Imperialists Direct the Kuomintang Remnant Bandits
  　Conspire "Sino-Japanese Cooperation" to Sabotage New China
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 26th】After staying in Japan for a week and holding two secret meetings with MacArthur, Wu Tiecheng returned to Taiwan on the 20th. The day after Wu returned to Taiwan, he sang his shameless traitorous tune of "Sino-Japanese cooperation" at a reception for legislators remaining in Taiwan, openly describing the past aggression of Japanese imperialism against China as "unilateral pursuit of cooperation," saying, "In the past, Japan sought cooperation through unilateral use of force, which has proven to be a mistake and brought disaster to Japan. Future cooperation should be based on the principle of peaceful mutual assistance, and economic and cultural cooperation should be pursued. This cooperation is equal and can bring real benefits to both sides." The so-called "Sino-Japanese cooperation" of the Kuomintang remnant bandits refers to the joint sabotage of New China by the Sino-Japanese reactionaries under the command of MacArthur, conspiring to jointly massacre and plunder the Chinese people. The plan that the Kuomintang bandits are secretly carrying out to recruit Japanese to assist the Kuomintang army in combat is one of the "new forms of Sino-Japanese cooperation" encouraged by MacArthur. Wu's secretary told Agence France-Presse reporters in Hong Kong on the 22nd that a group of people had "voluntarily joined" the Kuomintang army. This is one of the results of Wu's visit to MacArthur. In addition, the Kuomintang bandits have actively strengthened economic ties between Taiwan and Japan and South Korea in accordance with the instructions of their American masters. According to a report by the Kuomintang Central News Agency in Taipei on the 22nd, the Taiwan Provincial Pseudo-Council recently decided to form a "Japanese Economic Observation Group" to visit Japan for observation, as a preparation for the official start of trade between Taiwan and Japan. The Taiwan Kuomintang bandits have also agreed to the proposal of the South Korean puppet government to open air and sea routes between South Korea and Taiwan. The Guangzhou pseudo-Ministry of Foreign Affairs will formally discuss the implementation of the opening of routes with the South Korean puppet government.

　　美帝指使国民党残余匪帮
  　阴谋“中日合作”向新中国捣乱
    【新华社北平二十六日电】吴匪铁城在日本逗留了一个星期，与麦克阿瑟作过两度秘密会谈后，已于二十日返回台湾。吴匪回到台湾的第二天，即在留台湾立委招待会上大唱其“中日合作”的无耻卖国论调，公然将过去日本帝国主义对中国的侵略战争形容为“单方求取合作”，说什么“过去日本系以单方面用武力的方式求取合作，结果已证明其错误，并为日本招致灾难。今后之合作，应在和平互助之道义基础上，决取经济文化之合作。此种合作为平等的，可以双方获得确实之利益”。国民党残余匪帮的所谓“中日合作”，就是指中日反动派共同在麦克阿瑟指挥下向新中国捣乱，阴谋共同屠杀和掠夺中国人民。国民党匪帮正在暗中进行的招募日人来华协助国民党军作战的计划，即是麦克阿瑟所鼓励的“中日合作新方式”之一。吴匪的秘书二十二日在香港向法新社记者宣称：已有一批人“自愿投效”国民党军。这是吴匪此次拜见麦克阿瑟的结果之一。此外，国民党匪帮并已按照其美国主子意旨，积极加强台湾与日本及南韩的经济联系。据国民党中央社台北二十二日消息披露：台省伪参议会已于最近决议筹组“日本经济考察团”赴日考察，作为台湾和日本开始正式贸易的准备。南朝鲜傀儡政府所提议的南朝鲜和台湾通航问题，台湾国民党匪帮也已表示同意。通航方面将包括海航和空航两方面。广州伪外交部即将和南朝鲜傀儡政府正式商谈开航实施办法。
