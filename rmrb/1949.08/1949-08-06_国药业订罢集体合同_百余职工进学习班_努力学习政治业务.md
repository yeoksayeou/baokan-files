State Pharmaceutical Company Signs Collective Contract
Over a Hundred Employees Enter Study Class
Diligently Study Politics and Business

[This Municipality News] Since the establishment of the State Pharmaceutical Company's Trade Union, employees have enthusiastically launched organized and planned studies, making them the most active learners among shop assistants in private shops throughout the city.

The Trade Union originally planned to focus on District Nine for experimentation, holding employee study classes, gaining experience, and then promoting it to other districts. Initially, only a few dozen people participated, but after the work began, workers from neighboring outer city districts such as Eight, Ten, Eleven, and Twelve voluntarily signed up one after another. Later, workers from inner city districts such as Four, Six, and Seven also joined the study. As a result, the number of workers participating in the study classes almost expanded to the entire city, excluding Districts Two and Five, reaching more than one hundred and sixty people. They participated in the study so enthusiastically mainly because the organization of their own Trade Union and the signing of the labor-capital collective contract had enlightened their political consciousness through the resolution of practical problems. The collective contract guaranteed their deserved wages and benefits, and they all felt the need for a Trade Union and a deeper understanding of China's current revolutionary situation. Therefore, they are very enthusiastic about studying.

The study class started on August 1st, located at the Second People's Education Center in Qianmen Arrow Tower. It has been in session for five days, and very few people are absent each day. Workers living in Xizhimen Xinjekou also arrive on time. The time is from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM every day, because the drugstore business is slow during this time, and studying does not interfere with work.

The study class has a class affairs committee, jointly composed of three people from the People's Education Center, seven people from the Trade Union, and five students. Jiao Changshan, the director of the People's Education Center, serves as the chairman, and cadres from the People's Education Center serve as teachers. Students are divided into small groups of five to ten people, each selecting a group leader, totaling twenty-four groups. Eight groups jointly select a group leader, totaling three group leaders. The entire class also has one head monitor and one deputy head monitor. Learning problems are led by the group leaders, team leaders, and class monitors, respectively, assisting the class affairs committee. During study, lectures last fifty minutes, discussions last thirty minutes, and answering questions lasts twenty minutes. The workers discuss and ask questions very seriously.

The courses in the study class include: politics, current affairs, business, and singing. The content of the political course is "Political Common Knowledge" and "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." The selection of these two textbooks was not appropriate, as it did not take into account the workers' general political and cultural level and was only suitable for the needs of a few people. Therefore, many people felt that the textbooks were too difficult. Now, the teachers are adhering to the principles of "simplicity" and "shallowness," explaining problems in a simple and easy-to-understand manner. Regarding the content of business studies, workers' opinions are being sought as to what should be learned. The Trade Union believes that some basic knowledge of drugs and how to develop production and improve old drug manufacturing methods can be taught.

### 国药业订罢集体合同  百余职工进学习班  努力学习政治业务

    国药业订罢集体合同
    百余职工进学习班
    努力学习政治业务
    【本市讯】国药业职工会成立后，职工们已有组织有计划地热烈展开学习，是全市私营商店店员工人中学习最起劲的行业。
    该业职工会原计划在九区作重点试验，举办职工学习班，获得经验然后推广到各区，最初参加的只有几十人，但工作开始布置后，邻近的外城八、十、十一、十二等区的工人都相继自愿报名，后来内城各区如四、六、七三个区的工人也来参加学习，于是全市城区除去二、五区外，参加学习班的工人几已扩及全市，共达一百六十余人。他们所以这样热烈参加学习，主要是由于组织了自己的职工会、订立了劳资集体合同，从解决实际问题中启发了他们的政治觉悟。集体合同对他们应得的工资、福利有了保障，他们都感觉需要职工会，对中国目前革命形势也需要有深一层的认识，所以，对学习都很热心。
    学习班于八月一日开学，地点在前门箭楼第二人民教育馆，现在已上课五天，每天缺席的人极少，住在西直门新街口的工人也都准时赶去。时间是每天早晨七点到九点，因为在这时间内药铺买卖清淡，学习不耽误工作。
    学习班设班务委员会，由人民教育馆三人、职工会七人、学员五人共同组成，人民教育馆馆长焦长山任主任委员，民教馆的干部任教员，学员每五人到十人组成一小组，选一小组长，共分二十四小组，八个小组另合选一组长，共三个组长，全班另有正副班长各一人。学习上的问题由小组长、组长、班长分别协助班务委员会领导。学习时，讲课五十分钟，讨论三十分钟，解答二十分钟。工人们都很认真地讨论，提问题。
    学习班的课程有：政治、时事、业务、唱歌。政治课的内容是“政治常识”和“论人民民主专政”，这两种课本选择的不够适当，没照顾到工人普遍的政治文化水平，只适合少数人需要，所以很多人感觉课本太深。现在教员讲解时正本着“简”、“浅”的原则，通俗浅显的讲解问题。关于业务学习的内容，正征求工人意见到底学些什么。工会方面的意见，认为可以讲些药物常识，以及如何发展生产，改进旧的制药方法等。
