[Chahar News] As the autumn crops in northern Chahar are about to ripen, the Chahar North Special District Office is preparing to lead local masses to select seeds in the fields, in preparation for next year's increased production. The allocation of seed selection numbers is as follows: In addition to the Chahar Provincial Technology Promotion Team selecting 1,000 shi of wheat in Shangdu County, 400 shi in Zhangbei, 400 shi in Baoyuan, and 200 shi in Kangbao, totaling 2,000 shi, all farmers in the special district are required to independently select 5,600 shi of wheat seeds and 8,400 shi of naked oats seeds. The wheat seeds selected by the Provincial Technology Promotion Team can be used to offset the public grain, and even more can be used to offset it. Supply and marketing cooperatives will purchase these at higher prices. This seed selection task is quite important. The Chahar North Special District Office requires all subordinate counties to make specific arrangements as early as possible, widely publicize the significance of seed selection, dispel the masses' ideological concerns, and mobilize women and children to participate in seed selection. The Provincial Technology Promotion Team has now been divided into two groups to work in Shangdu and Zhangbei respectively.

　　作好明年增产准备察北计划选种万石
    【察哈尔讯】察哈尔北部大秋作物即将成熟，察北专署正准备领导当地群众到田间选种，给明年增产作好准备。选种数字的分配，除察省技术推广队在商都县选小麦一千市石，张北选四百市石，宝源选四百市石，康保选二百市石共两千市石外，并要求全专区农民自行选出小麦种五千六百市石，莜麦种八千四百市石。由省技术推广队选出的麦种，可顶公粮，并可多顶一点。供销社以较高价格收买。这次选种任务相当重大，察北专署要求所属各县及早作具体布置，广泛宣传选种的意义，解除群众思想顾虑，动员妇女儿童参加选种。省技术推广队现已分成两组，即分赴商都、张北工作。
