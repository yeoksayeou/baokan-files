    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th. According to an article by Paul de Groot, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Netherlands, in the May 1st issue of "For Lasting Peace and People's Democracy," describing the progress of the Indonesian people's persistent struggle for liberation: According to Indonesian newspapers, a new national united underground government has been formed under the leadership of the Communist Party. The article pointed out that the Indonesian people are waging a heroic struggle for liberation against the US-Dutch imperialist bandits. This struggle is steadily developing into a nationwide resistance movement politically, economically, and militarily. The Indonesian national resistance forces are not only active in the mountains and forests; they are everywhere throughout the vast archipelago, in towns and villages, in factories and plantations. They launch frontal attacks, raid factories and plantations, carry away equipment and weapons, cut off the colonial army's transportation lines, and punish traitors who cooperate with the invaders.
    The article continued that casualty lists are frequently published in the Netherlands, and the serious situation of the Dutch army in Indonesia has caused deep unease among the Dutch people, and even among some bourgeois elements. At the beginning of this year, the Dutch reactionaries, led by the right-wing Social Democratic Party, could still deceive the people and tried to isolate the Communist Party—the only party in the Netherlands that firmly opposed the colonial war. But now, under the influence of political and military failures, social forces have undergone some differentiation. The struggle against the colonial war is being carried out simultaneously with the struggle against the preparation for a new world war, with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as its main tool.
    The article concluded that the Communist Party of the Netherlands is carrying out an active anti-war struggle under these circumstances. It opposes the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and demands that the working people not recognize it. It demands the dissolution of parliament and the holding of new elections.

    印尼人民地下政府组成
    在共产党领导下团结斗争
    展开全国性抵抗美荷运动
    【新华社北平六日电】荷兰共产党总书记保罗·得·格鲁特在本年五月一日“争取持久和平与人民民主”报上撰文描述印尼人民坚持解放斗争的进展称：据印尼报纸报道，一个新的全国团结的地下政府，已在共产党领导下组成。该文指出：印尼人民正在进行一个英勇的反对美荷帝国主义匪帮的解放斗争。这个斗争正节节发展成为一个政治上、经济上、军事上的全国性的抵抗运动。印尼全国性抵抗力量不仅在山地和森林里活动，他们在广大的岛国上，在城镇和乡村，在工厂和种植园里，到处都是。他们发动正面进攻，奇袭工厂和种植园，携走装备和武器，切断殖民军的交通线，并惩罚与侵略者合作的卖国贼。
    该文继称，伤亡的名单经常在荷兰公布着，荷军在印尼的严重情况在荷兰人民中，而且也在某些资产阶级分子中，引起了深刻的不安。在今年年初，以右翼社会民主党为首的荷兰反动派还可以欺骗一下人民，并且还想孤立共产党——在荷兰唯一坚决地反对殖民战争的党，可是现在，在政治和军事的失败的影响下，社会力量已发生了某些分化。反对殖民战争的斗争，是与反对以北大西洋公约为主要工具的新的世界战争的准备的斗争同时进行的。
    该文结语指出：荷兰共产党是在这种情势下进行着积极的反战斗争。它反对北大西洋公约，要求劳动人民不承认它。它要求解散国会，重新举行选举。
