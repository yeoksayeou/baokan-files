　　Reduce Fees, Improve Services
  　Beiping Telecommunications Bureau Implements Telecommunications Conference Decisions
    [This Newspaper reports] Since the North China Telecommunications Conference reviewed the issues regarding the unification of telecommunications regulations in the North China region, the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau has rapidly implemented the new regulations from the conference. These new regulations safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of users and reduce their burden. The main points are: Most of the important telegraph and telephone rates have been reduced, and some fees have been completely abolished. For example, the fee for moving a telephone indoors used to be eighty jin of millet, but now it has been reduced sevenfold to only ten jin of millet; the standard fee for moving a telephone outdoors used to be equivalent to one hundred and sixty jin of millet, but now it is reduced to thirty jin of millet; the installation fee for new telephones has also been changed to be priced according to the amount of materials used, with the ordinary installation within fifty meters costing the equivalent of two hundred jin of millet; the transfer fee used to be 24,000 yuan in addition to the machine deposit, but now it has been reduced to 10,000 yuan; the "prepaid long-distance call fee" has been cancelled, and users who want to make long-distance calls only need to register at the Changdian business office of the telecommunications bureau and find a guarantor; the name change fee used to be two hundred jin of millet, but now it is waived altogether. For the sake of rationality and science, the telegraph rates have also been changed to be determined by distance. Ordinary telegrams cost eighty yuan per word within the province and one hundred and twenty yuan per word outside the province. Areas in neighboring provinces within a spatial distance of one hundred kilometers are still charged at the in-province rate. Social and travel telegrams have been cancelled due to practical needs. Night letter telegrams have been changed to letter telegrams. Agencies above the special district level are given preferential treatment for official long-distance telephone calls and telegrams. In addition, public service work has been improved, the connection with the masses has been strengthened, and every effort is made to help users from all walks of life solve problems in telecommunications.

　　减低收费改进业务
  　平电信局执行电信会议决定
    【本报讯】自华北电信会议检讨了关于统一华北区电信制度规章的问题后，北平电信局现已把会议中的新规定迅速执行。这些新规定是维护用户合理权益和减少用户负担的，主要的是：大部分的重要报话价目都减低了，有的费用根本已被取消，如电话室内移机费以前要八十斤小米，现在减了七倍，仅收十斤小米；室外移机以前标准要合一百六十斤小米，现在改收三十斤小米；新装电话也改为视用材料的多寡来定价，普通在五十公尺以内的只合小米二百斤；过户费以前除补缴押机费外，手续费要收二万四千元，现在改低为一万元；“预存长途话费”取消，用户要打长途电话只要到电信局厂甸营业处来登记一下，找个保就可以了；更名费以前要收二百斤小米，现改为一律免收。关于电报价目为了合理和科学起见，也改为按距离远近来规定，普通电报本省每字八十元，外省每字一百二十元，邻省两地空间距离不逾一百公里者仍按本省计费，交际和旅行电报由于事实的不需要，已被取消，夜信电报改为书信电报，专署以上机关因公挂叫长途电话和发电报都给予优待。并且健全了公众服务工作，加强与群众间的联系，尽量帮助各界用户来解决电信方面的问题。
