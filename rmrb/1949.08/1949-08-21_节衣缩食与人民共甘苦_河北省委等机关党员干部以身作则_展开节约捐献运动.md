Practicing Austerity and Sharing Hardships with the People
　　Party Members and Cadres of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and Other Organs Take the Lead in Launching a Savings and Donation Campaign

　　[Baoding Telegram] In response to the call of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for production and disaster relief, and for overcoming famine through thrift, the directly subordinate Party Committee of the Provincial Party Committee, Baoding City, and the Baoding and Tangshan Special Districts convened meetings of party members and cadres to call on their subordinate party members and cadres to practice austerity, donate to disaster relief. The directly subordinate Party Committee of the Provincial Party Committee urgently instructed the general branches and branches of all directly subordinate organs to promptly discuss the Provincial Party Committee's call for production and disaster relief, so that every party member and cadre would fully recognize the severity of this year's disaster ideologically, vigorously lead the masses in carrying out production and disaster relief, and launch a savings campaign to reduce the people's burden. The General Branch of the Provincial Party Committee organs convened a meeting of party member representatives from the directly subordinate branches on the 16th and made a savings plan: in addition to saving on public goods, starting from September, each person will save one or two liang of rice per day, and 80% of the savings from the kitchen will be used to help disaster victims. A production campaign week (using rest time) was also stipulated to carry out vegetable planting, firewood gathering, and grass cutting. At the meeting, all party members and cadres immediately signed up to donate clothes and money to help disaster victims. After the Baoding Municipal Party Committee convened an enlarged meeting of cadres from all municipal organs on the 16th to convey the Provincial Party Committee's call for production and disaster relief, it immediately aroused a warm response from all party members and cadres, who eagerly contributed money. Among only 77 organ cadres, over 990 jin of grain were donated. In addition to making savings plans and actively donating grain and money by party members and cadres in the organs of Baoding and Tangshan Special Districts, the cadres of organs in Tangshan Special District launched a letter-writing campaign to mobilize their families or relatives and friends to overcome all difficulties, engage in self-salvation through production, promote mutual assistance and mutual aid, and help formulate production and savings plans. Cadres of organs in Baoding Special District have been setting aside their spare time since the 14th to help the masses catch and kill locusts for disaster relief. The prefectural committee and the special commissioner's office are using a method of having one person do the work of two, and have extracted thirty cadres to help the masses organize production.
