A Record of Attending the Meeting on Returning the Daxing Cotton Mill
    Our reporter Shang Kai
    The meeting on returning the Daxing Cotton Mill in Shijiazhuang was conducted in a harmonious atmosphere. The meeting room was fresh and elegant.
    It must be beneficial to the development of production, and it must be fair and reasonable. This is the principle that both parties (government and capital) representatives unanimously followed.
    Comrade Huo Ran, the director of the Daxing Cotton Mill, reported in his capacity as a government representative the heroic story of the Daxing workers rebuilding the Daxing Cotton Mill with the support of the People's Government: Twenty-one months ago, when the Daxing Cotton Mill was being bombed with factory buildings collapsing, machines flying, and smoke and flames soaring into the sky, cadres and workers carried out a life-risking rescue. In the subsequent restoration process, they received strong support from the government. All employees, while guarding against special agents and protecting the factory, fought against difficulties and achieved today's success from the ruins of broken walls, broken copper and scrap iron. This remark made the capital representatives nod frequently on the spot, and representative Tao Zhinong said that he admired it to the point of prostration. Because these facts made the national capitalists clearly see that the People's Government is making the greatest efforts to seek the restoration of all public and private enterprises. At the same time, it also made the national capitalists realize that the restoration and development of production must rely on the masses of workers. The capital representative made such a metaphor: Daxing is an infant who was bombed and wounded all over. Fortunately, he was treated and nurtured by the People's Government and recovered his health. In the future, he hopes that the government will continue to teach him so that he can grow into talent.
    "Will the government really return it?" This was a huge question mark in the minds of the capital representatives. Later, they themselves admitted that this visit was of a tentative nature. When asked to first put forward their requirements for the government and their operating plans, they repeatedly expressed vaguely: "We are willing to obey the government's instructions in everything." However, in the gaps of the conversation, it revealed the meaning that the capital side was willing to operate on its own, but it was not clearly stated, which was obviously still a concern. The government representative sincerely explained to the capital side's concerns: "Today is not to study the issue of whether to return it, but to study how to return it. Returning the Daxing Cotton Mill is already a solemn decision of the government." The frank attitude of the government representative unexpectedly increased the capital side's excessive concerns: If self-management is proposed, how much will the government's construction costs be? Therefore, Mr. Lu Shaoyou, a participant from the capital side, repeatedly emphasized: The central issue is "economic issues." Then the government representative continued to dispel the capital side's concerns with the public figures of the construction cost. Only then did the capital side clearly put forward the plan to request the full return for self-management.
    Disputes arose in the discussion of repaying the government's construction costs for restoring the factory. The capital representatives proposed: Due to insufficient funds, they requested that the construction costs be changed to government loans, or repaid in installments from the profits of the cotton mill, so as to achieve the goal of supporting the factory with the factory. The government representative raised objections to this proposal from the capital side, because it was not in line with the principle of fairness and reasonableness. "If you want to eat eggs, you have to be willing to feed rice." It is not good for the development of industry and the expansion of production to rely entirely on state funds economically without hard work and to think only of making profits. As for applying for loans from the government, that is another issue after the transfer, and should not be confused today. As a result of the dispute, it was agreed that if there were insufficient funds, the government trade organs could weave on behalf of the factory. The government trade organs would do their best to assist in the purchase and sale of raw materials and finished products.
    Regarding the transfer of existing materials and equipment, the capital side requested pricing half a month before the handover. The government representative immediately pointed out: Because all production has not been fully restored today, prices cannot tend to be stable. Pricing half a month in advance would cause the government to suffer losses. Later, everyone agreed to price according to the market price at that time and place, and both parties maintained freedom of buying and selling, which was in line with the principle of fairness and reasonableness. The government representative then stated: Since the resumption of work at Daxing, the government has been responsible for all profits and losses, but the use of the houses and machines of the Daxing Cotton Mill can be handed over to the capital side on a monthly basis with depreciation in kind. Before he finished speaking, the capital representative immediately showed a surprised expression. Mr. Tao Zhinong said: "The government is really thoughtful. We wanted to mention it, but considering the difficulty of the government rebuilding Daxing, we were too embarrassed to mention it. The government proposed it first. It's really fair and reasonable! It's really fair and reasonable!" The sincerity of the government's attitude moved the capital representatives. Mr. Tao Zhinong said, "At first, no one dared to come, thinking they were coming to jump into a fire pit!" This interesting and true sentence revealed the capitalists' concerns at that time, which caused everyone to laugh. But after coming here, what is the actual situation? Mr. Tao has seen it very clearly. The People's Government overcame difficulties, restored the factory, and after restoring and developing production, took care of the private capital's operation and returned the factory to them.
    Since the first day of the meeting, after hearing about the current production situation of the Daxing Cotton Mill and consulting the photos, the capital representatives said: "The increase in output and quality now is really something we never expected. From this, we realize that to develop production, we can only rely on workers. The past methods of running factories that ignored trade unions and forced workers to obey orders were wrong." Therefore, they stated that in addition to ensuring that workers' welfare is handled in accordance with regulations and labor-capital relations are handled in accordance with government guidance, they repeatedly proposed retaining Director Huo Ran and the original cadres. However, Comrade Huo Ran expressed his refusal to this proposal. His meaning was: The capital side should not completely rely on the government in administrative management. As long as democratic management is implemented in the future and the government's policy of benefiting both labor and capital is implemented, it is possible to overcome difficulties and develop upward by running the factory well.
    The handover plan was signed, and both parties placed common hopes on the Daxing Cotton Mill. Shijiazhuang is located in the center of cotton and coal production areas, which is a condition for the long-term development of the Daxing Cotton Mill in the future. Moving several cotton mills that were moved to Sichuan during the Anti-Japanese War to North China and operating 200,000 spindles together is a beautiful long-term prospect for the Daxing Cotton Mill in the near future. Mr. Tao Zhinong said, "Today we only hope that the whole country will be liberated soon."

　　发还大兴纱厂会谈旁听记
    本报记者  商恺
    发还石家庄大兴纱厂的会谈，一直是在和谐的气氛中进行。会议室清新而幽雅。
    必须有利于发展生产，必须公平合理。这是双方（政府与资方）代表所一致遵循的原则。
    大兴纱厂厂长霍然同志，他以政府代表的身份报告：在人民政府支持下，大兴工人重建大兴纱厂的英雄故事：二十一个月前，大兴纱厂正炸得厂房崩塌，机器横飞，硝烟烈焰腾空之际，干部和工人，进行了冒死抢救。在后来的修复过程中，又获得了政府的大力支持，全体员工，一面防特护厂，一面与困难搏斗，从残垣断壁，碎铜破铁的废墟上，获得了今天的成就。这一席话，使资方代表当场频频点首，代表陶稚农先生表示他已佩服到五体投地。因为这些事实，使民族资本家很清楚的看到：人民政府是尽最大努力来谋求一切公私企业之恢复。同时也使民族资本家认识到恢复和发展生产，必须依靠工人群众。资方代表曾打了这样一个比喻：大兴是一个被炸得遍体鳞伤的婴儿，幸遇人民政府医治抚养，恢复了健康之驱，今后尚望政府继续教导，使其长大成材。
    “政府是否真正发还？”这在资方代表的思想上，划着一个极大的问号。后来他们自己也承认，这次的前来是带有试探性质的。当让其首先提出对政府要求与经营方案时，却几次笼统的表示：“一切愿服从政府指示”。但在言谈的缝隙里，却透露出资方愿意自营的语意，只是不明确提出，这显然是还有着顾虑。政府代表针对着资方这种疑虑的心情恳切的说明：“今天并非研究是否发还的问题，而是研究如何发还的问题，发还大兴纱厂已是政府庄严的决定。”政府代表这种坦率的态度，不料在资方却相反的更增加了过多的疑虑：如果提出自营，政府的修建费用到底有多大呢？因此资方参加人鲁绍猷先生一再强调着说：中心问题是“经济问题”。于是政府代表继续用修建费用的公开数字，进一步打消了资方顾虑，然后资方才明确提出：请求全部发还自营的方案。
    在讨论偿还政府恢复工厂修建费的问题上曾发生了争义。资方代表提出：资金不足，要求将修建费改为政府贷款，或是用纱厂利润分期偿还，以达到以厂养厂。政府代表对资方这一提议，提出了反对的意见，因为这是不合于公平合理的原则的，“要吃鸡蛋，就要舍得喂米。”不去艰苦经营，在经济上完全依赖国家资金，净获利润的思想对发展工业扩大生产是没有好处的。至于向政府贷款，那是移交后的另一问题，今天不该混为一谈。争议的结果，抚于一致，资金不足，可为政府贸易机关代为纺织。在原料成品的采购与推销方面，政府贸易机关自当尽力扶助。
    关于现存物料器材的让渡问题，资方要求于接交前半月作价。政府代表立即提出：因为今天一切生产尚未完全恢复，物价不能趋于稳定。半月前作价，会使政府吃亏的。后来大家同意按当时当地的市价作价，双方保持买卖自由，符合于公平合理的原则。政府代表接着提出：大兴复工以来，一切盈亏均由政府负责，但使用大兴纱厂的房屋机器，可按月以实物折旧交付资方。话未说完，资方代表立即表现了惊喜的神情。陶稚农先生说：“政府想的真周到，我们想提可是鉴于政府重建大兴之不易，还没好意思提，政府就先提出了。真是公平合理！真是公平合理。”政府态度的诚恳，感动了资方代表，陶稚农先生说：“当初谁也不敢来，认为是来跳火坑哩！”这一句有趣的真实话道出了当时资本家的顾虑心情，惹得大家哄然一笑。但来此之后，实际情况如何呢？陶先生已看得很清楚。人民政府是在克服困难中，恢复了工厂，又在恢复发展了生产后，照顾私人资本的经营把工厂发还给他们。
    资方代表自从会议的第一天听了大兴纱厂的目前生产情况，参阅了照片写真，曾说：“现在产量质量的提高，真是我们从来没想到的。从此认识到发展生产，只有依靠工人，过去办工厂漠视工会，强迫命令工人的办法是错误的。”因此他们表示：除今后工人福利一律照办，劳资关系，遵照政府指导处理外。并一再提出挽留霍然厂长及原班干部。但霍然同志对这一提议，表示了谢绝。他的意思是：资方在行政管理上不应完全依赖政府。今后只要实行民主管理，贯彻政府劳资两利政策，将工厂办好，是能克服困难，向上发展的。
    接交方案签字了，双方对大兴纱厂都寄予共同的希望。石家庄地处棉煤产地中心，这是今后大兴纱厂长足发展的条件。将抗日期间迁往四川的几个纱厂迁来华北，二十万纺锭一齐运转，这是大兴纱厂不久的美丽远景。陶稚农先生说：“今天我们只盼着全国早日解放。”
