New York and Hoboken Town
    Excerpt from "The Real America"
    A. Labiski
    New York guidebooks meticulously tell visitors about the Statue of Liberty and how many millions were spent on the celebrated skyscrapers. In that little book, you will see pictures of "Park Avenue" and scenes of "Broadway" day and night. But you will not find any reports on the living conditions of ordinary citizens in this vast city.

    However, most parts of this city are indeed worlds apart from the New York that stares at you from the explanatory guide. Take Harlem, a black district with a population of 500,000, or Chinatown near "Third Street," or the "Lower East Side" (eastern part of Manhattan) where the working masses live. Not more than ten to fifteen minutes by car from the wealthy residential area of Park Avenue, there are long rows of desolate gray houses. They should have been torn down long ago. Hundreds and thousands of people live in this filthy area, without light or air. The percentage of tuberculosis in the working-class areas is several times higher than the city average. The infant mortality rate is three times higher than in the affluent residential areas.

    Anyone who has been to the places where workers live will not be surprised to hear that sixteen million Americans are living in houses that, according to official materials, do not have the basic sanitary conditions and other necessities for human habitation. New York City Mayor O'Dwyer admitted that 450,000 New York families are living in houses that are not fit for human habitation.

    In New York, housing has long become an object of profiteering. Real estate companies make huge profits. Since the war, these companies have successfully lobbied members of Congress to block housing plans. Through their efforts, the $350 million in credit loans allocated for housing construction was not approved, the prefabricated housing industry (i.e., houses whose parts are prefabricated in factories and then transported to the site for assembly – translator) was paralyzed, and the prices of building materials were no longer subject to price controls.

    Landlords use every trick to evade rent control. Here is what happens when a tenant, eager to find a house, finally finds a vacant room or house after a long search. Pointing to a broken armchair in the corner, the broker says:

    "The chair costs a thousand dollars."

    "Is that so? I don't need it."

    "In that case, you probably don't need this house either. If you want this house, you will have to keep that chair as well."

    This is very common in New York.

    Here is an interesting indirect illustration. Congress has done a lot of good things for landlords, helping them extract exorbitant rents from millions of tenants and keep rents in Washington at a stable level. Secondly, some members of Congress and senators themselves profited from the housing crisis in Washington, which had been exacerbated by the increase in wartime government personnel. Former Senator O'Daniel (Democrat from Texas) bought a four-story apartment building in Washington and then set about evicting all the families living in it. When asked why he needed forty rooms, this noble representative of the Southern aristocracy replied, "We in Texas are not used to living with others." After evicting all the tenants, he sold all the rooms at high prices, and he himself moved into a small house. The American newspapers admired the senator's "business acumen."

    Last summer, New York celebrated its "golden anniversary" with great pomp and ceremony. A noisy parade was held on Fifth Avenue. Newspapers extolled the city's beauty and progress, the power of its 157 banks and 94 insurance companies, and the influence of the "cosmetic queens" who "decide which face cream millions of women use to moisturize their faces." Indeed, three times more money is spent on cosmetics in the United States than on education. But in celebrating New York's anniversary, American newspapers did not talk about the state of neglect in education, healthcare, and the arts in the city and the country.

    They are willing to spend billions of dollars on armaments, interfering in Greece and China, and supporting reactionary regimes around the world, but they are unwilling to improve the people's health needs.

    In a public letter to New York City Mayor O'Dwyer, Hospital Commissioner Edward M. Bernecker stated that the situation in hospitals is becoming "more and more desperate," with old hospitals falling into disrepair and new ones not being built.

    According to clinical statistics, one-sixth of the American population (25 million) suffers from various chronic diseases. Yet 40 million Americans live in areas without satisfactory medical facilities.

    The New York Times, citing these figures, wrote: "The situation of our children is, in many ways, frightening."

    Pointing out that even in areas with adequate medical facilities, the cost of medical care is too high for most residents to afford, the newspaper commented:

    "Hundreds of thousands of families can usually only afford to see a doctor in case of emergency. Hospitalization, even for a short period, throws the family's finances into absolute chaos."

    Across the busy Hudson (the river that crosses New York – translator), opposite the skyscrapers of Manhattan, is the town of Hoboken. It is connected to New York by ferries and tunnels. It is a port town with a population of 50,000, with electrical, food, chemical, and other enterprises. Unexpectedly, its population is declining: it has decreased by more than one-third since 1930. Its buildings are collapsing beyond repair, its streets are unattended, and pale children play in piles of garbage.

    For twenty-five years, Hoboken has been managed by the local Democratic Party headed by Mayor McFeely the tycoon. Impoverished Hoboken has become increasingly the source of wealth for McFeely and his gang. McFeely implemented a system whereby all municipal civil servants, from police and firefighters to teachers, were forced to contribute a certain percentage of their salaries to his campaign fund. Only a small portion of the funds collected in this way was actually used in the campaign. The remainder went directly into the pockets of McFeely and his followers. With a weekly official salary of seventy-one dollars, McFeely accumulated a fortune of three million dollars.

    Next to Hoboken's City Hall, governed by McFeely, is the garage and office of McFeely General Contracting Company. One of the mayor's important sources of income is the town's garbage disposal contract. In his capacity as mayor, he signed a contract with his own company to handle the city's garbage, at a cost three times higher than normal. In Hoboken, building permits are only issued to companies that have contracts with McFeely's company.

    The mayor has become so accustomed to treating Hoboken as his private property that he has placed all his distant and close relatives in various municipal government agencies. His brother was appointed police chief of Hoboken, his son deputy chief, and so on. More than fifty of McFeely's relatives are municipal officials.

### 纽约和哈卜根小镇  摘译自“美国真貌”

    纽约和哈卜根小镇
    摘译自“美国真貌”
    Ａ·拉碧斯基
    纽约游览指南详尽地告诉来客们关于自由神之像，关于建筑可庆贺的摩天楼费了多少百万。在那本小书里你将看到“公园大街”的画片，“百老汇大街”白天和黑夜里的景致。但你将找不到关于这个庞大城市底普通市民的生活条件的任何报导。
    然而这个城市大部分地区和从说明的指南中凝视着你的纽约，的确是不啻天渊之别。拿人口五十万的黑人区哈尔利姆或是“第三街”附近的唐人街，或劳动群众居住的“城东区”（曼哈顿区东部）来说吧。和公园大街的富裕住宅区相去不到十—十五分钟的汽车路程，排着长长的一排排凄凉的灰色房舍。它们早该拆掉了的。成百成千的人民就住居在这个污秽地区，没有光也没有空气。肺结核病在工人阶级区中的百分比比全市的平均数高出好几倍。婴孩死亡率比美好住宅区高出三倍。
    谁要是到过工人们居住的地方，那末在听到一千六百万美国人正住在，据官方材料说，未具备人类居住的基本卫生条件和其他需要的房屋时，他将不会觉得惊奇。纽约市长奥·狄威尔承认四十五万个纽约家庭正住在不是人住的房屋内。
    房子在纽约早就成为牟利的对象。不动产公司获得庞大的利润。自从战争以来，这些公司在国会里运动议员者已胜利地阻止通过房屋计划。经过他们的努力，拨作房屋建筑用的三千五百万元信用贷款未获通过，生产预造房屋（即先将房屋各部分在厂制就，然后运到当地配合的房屋——译者）的工业瘫痪了，建筑器材的价格已不在限价之列。
    房东们利用一切技俩来骗过限价的房租。这儿就是一个急着找房子的房客，很久以后终于找到一间空房或一所房舍时的际遇。指着角落里的一张破安乐椅，经纪人说：
    “椅子要一千元”。
    “是这样吗？我不需要它”。
    “这样的话，你也许也不需要这间房子了。假如你要这个房子你将必须也留下那张椅子”。
    这在纽约是很通常的。
    这儿有一个有趣的间接说明。国会曾给房东们做了不少好事，帮助他们从千百万房客身上榨取昂贵的租金，并保持华盛顿的房租在稳定的水平上。其次，原来有一些国会人士和参议员，他们自己就从华盛顿的房屋危机中谋利，这个危机曾因战时政府人员的增加而加深了。前参议员奥·狄尼尔（得萨克斯州民主党人）在华盛顿买了一座四层楼的公寓，然后着手逐出所有住在其中的家庭。当询以他为何需要四十个房间时，这位南方贵族的高贵代表回答说：“我们在得萨克斯一贯是不与人同居的”。于逐出所有的房客以后，他把所有房间以高利价格卖出去，他自己则搬到一座小房里。美国报章很赞赏这个参议员的“生意眼”。
    去夏，纽约以盛大的繁华与仪式庆祝其“黄金的周年纪念”。在第五街举行了喧闹的游行。报章在讴歌城市的美观和进展，它的一百五十七家银行和九十四家保险公司的权势，以及那些“决定百万妇女用哪种面膏敷润她们的脸孔”的“化妆皇后”的影响。的确，在美国用在化妆品的钱是用在教育上的三倍。但在庆祝纽约的周年纪念中，美国报纸却不谈该市以及全国在教育、保健和艺术上的忽视状态。
    他们肯以亿万元花在军备上、干涉希腊和中国及支持全世界的反动政权上，却不肯改善人民卫生需要。
    在给纽约市长奥·狄威尔的公开信中，医院政府专员爱华德·Ｍ·贝尔涅克尔声称：各医院的情况正日益“更加绝望”，旧的医院已颓颓欲倒，而新的又没有建筑起来。
    根据诊疗统计，美国人口有六分之一（二千五百万）是各种痼疾病患者。然而犹有四千万美国人住在没有满意的医药设备的地区。
    “纽约时报”引列这些数字写道：“我们的孩子们的情况，在许多方面，是很怕人的”。
    于指出甚至在有适当医药设备的地区，医药费用之昂贵也为大部分居民不堪负担，该报对此评称：
    “千百个家庭通常只有在急病时才请得起医生。入院，甚至是一个短时期，就使得家庭的开支陷入绝对混乱中。”
    在忙碌的哈得逊（横穿纽约的河流——译者）彼岸，曼哈顿的摩天楼对过，有一个哈卜根小镇。它和纽约有轮渡与隧道相通。它是一个人口五万的、有电气、粮食、化学及其他企业的港口。意外的，它的人口在退减：自一九三○年以来已减少了三分之一以上。它的建筑正颓坍到不堪修缮，它的街道没有人照管，苍白的孩童在垃圾堆中嬉戏。
    二十五年来，哈卜根是由市长麦克费利大亨领导的当地民主党部管理。穷陋的哈卜根愈加成为麦克费利及其一伙的发家地。麦克费利实施一种制度，从而所有市政公务员，从警察、消防队到教师，都迫着拿出薪俸的一定的百分比贡献给他的竞选基金。这样搜集起来的基金，实际只有一小部分用到竞选中。余款就径直落到麦克费利及其徒众的口袋里。每周官薪七十一元，麦克费利却攒聚下一笔三百万元的财产。
    在麦克费利治理哈卜根的市府大楼隔壁，就是麦克费利通用包工公司的汽车库和办事处。市长底入息的重要来源之一是市镇垃圾清除合同。以市长资格，他和自己的公司订了一个承办全市垃圾的合同，需费比一般的高出三倍。在哈卜根，建筑许可证只发给与麦克费利公司订立的合同。
    市长已是这样惯于视哈卜根为其私产，于是就把自己的远亲近戚统统安插到市政府各机关来。他的兄弟被委为哈卜根警察局长，他的儿子副局长，如此类推。麦克费利的五十多个亲戚，都是市政官员。（炳辉译自苏联新时代杂志一九四九年第三期）
