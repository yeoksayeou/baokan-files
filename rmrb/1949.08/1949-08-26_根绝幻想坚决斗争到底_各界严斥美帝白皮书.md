Eradicate Illusions and Resolutely Fight to the End
All Circles Sternly Condemn the US Imperialist White Paper
Scientific Workers in Beiping
Hold a Forum on the White Paper
Unanimously Agree to Break the Mistaken Idea of Dependence on US Imperialism, Unite to Jointly Deal with this "Paper Tiger."

[Report from this newspaper] The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Natural Science Workers Representative Conference, at 3:30 PM on the 24th, invited scientific workers in Beiping to the Overseas Students Association to hold a forum on the "United States Relations with China" White Paper published by the US reactionary government. In addition to the members of the Preparatory Committee of the Scientific Workers Preparatory Committee, participants included scientific and technical workers from various production organs, professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants from the colleges of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine of various universities, as well as scientific workers recently arrived in Beiping from abroad, including He Cheng, Liu Ding, Zeng Zhaolun, Lu Zhiwei, Li Zong'en, Huang Ziqing, Rao Yutai, Zhang Zigao, Yan Jici, Li Linyu, Zhou Jianren, Ding Xielin, Hua Nangui, Fu Zhongsun, Zhang Jingyue, Miles, Jiang Yutu, Zhang Daqi, Gao Shiqi, Jiang Zehan, Sun Yunzhu, Yun Ziqiang, Yuan Fuli, Zhu Weiheng, Yuan Hanqing, Le Tianyu, Xia Kangnong, Yang Zengyi, Ma Dayou, Tu Shou'e, Li Xianzhi, Zhang Zongbing, and Yang Jie, totaling more than eighty people. This was the most enthusiastic forum in the Beiping scientific community. Everyone spoke extremely enthusiastically at the meeting. Bacteriologist Gao Shiqi even composed a poem "White Paper" and recited it on the spot. The forum was chaired by Liu Ding and conducted in two groups simultaneously, with Zeng Zhaolun and Yuan Hanqing elected as temporary moderators of the two groups. The discussion revolved around the following questions: (1) The US-China relations shown in the White Paper; (2) What is "democratic individualism" and the understanding that scientific workers should have of it; (3) What specific work should Chinese scientific workers do in response to the new US imperialist policy of aggression? (4) What is the future of US imperialism? The forum lasted for three hours. In the discussions of both groups, it was jointly pointed out that the US-China relations described in the White Paper are a record of aggression and an open insult to the Chinese people. The US government's continued conspiracy to undermine the cause of the Chinese people deserves serious vigilance. At the meeting, everyone unanimously agreed that the mistaken idea of relying on the help of US imperialism must be broken. Scientific workers must strive to stick to their posts, strengthen their own unity, closely connect with the broad masses of workers and peasants and the industrial circles in China, and establish close cooperation with friendly country the Soviet Union in the international community to jointly deal with the conspiracy of US imperialism. The meeting also pointed out that Acheson's plan will inevitably fail, and no matter how ferocious the US government is, it is ultimately just a "paper tiger." Finally, the meeting decided that those present should separately mobilize scientific workers in their respective organs and schools to launch further discussions on the "White Paper" issue (the minutes of the forum will be published separately).

Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, North China General Branch Statement
Taiwan is an Inalienable Part of China's Territory
Taiwanese Compatriots Will Surely Rise Up to Smash the US Imperialist Conspiracy

[Report from this newspaper] The North China General Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League issued a statement on the US imperialist White Paper, the full text of which is as follows:
The "United States Relations with China" White Paper published by the US State Department on August 5 is a series of historical facts of US imperialist aggression against China. Although it is 1,054 pages long, it is not the whole of the hideous truth. It confessed unprompted that the US government spent $2,768 million in five years to carry out the task of the third line towards China, that is, openly advocating cooperation and secretly assisting, thus enabling the Kuomintang reactionaries to "apparently reach the peak in military achievements and territorial expansion" for a period, directing and launching the Kuomintang bandit gang's anti-people all-out civil war.

But what was the result of all the painstaking efforts? US imperialism had to admit that in carrying out the policy of aggression against China, it created the conditions for its own demise, became the arsenal of the People's Liberation Army, and the incurable Chiang Kai-shek became the transportation captain. This made the strength of the Chinese people increasingly stronger and became an invincible and powerful pillar for defending the world peace and democracy camp; its dream of ruling China ultimately vanished into thin air, and everything fell through.

But US imperialism's ambition to turn China into its colony will never give up. At the end of World War II, in order to dominate the world, US imperialism had already attempted to deploy three major anti-communist, anti-Soviet, anti-democratic, and anti-peace positions in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. China was the largest base it had selected in Asia, especially Taiwan, which is the heart of the second Far Eastern anti-communist defense line of US imperialism. Now, in order to compensate for this irreparable failure, US imperialism has shamelessly exposed a new and vicious conspiracy, placing its last hope on "democratic individualism," attempting to revive the dying embers, and for this purpose, it is desperately supporting national scum.

But the eyes of the Taiwanese people are sharp and will never be fooled again. Although the US imperialist running dogs representing the landlord class, such as Liao Wenyi, shout "trusteeship" and "independence," the Taiwanese people have long recognized the path to take. So-called "democratic individualists" who still have illusions about the US imperialism, you should wake up. US imperialism, as it confessed itself, is enslaving us, driving the Kuomintang reactionaries to massacre the Chinese people; precisely because it knows that the Kuomintang and its forces in China are about to perish, it is also barking madly about a "Pacific alliance," stepping up the construction of airports and all military facilities in Taiwan,妄想以台湾作为将来开展反中国人民、反世界人民战争的反动堡垒. But the Taiwanese people will rise up, and they will surely rise up, to respond to them with revolutionary actions.

Fuzhou has been completely liberated, and Taiwan, the last struggling base of the Kuomintang's remnant bandits, which has lost its outer defensive barrier, is now fully exposed to the spearhead of the People's Liberation Army. No matter what absurd logic US imperialism is still fabricating, such as "Taiwan still belongs to Japanese territory before the signing of the peace treaty with Japan," Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, and it belongs to the Chinese people. We Taiwanese compatriots must closely follow the Chinese Communist Party, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, and will spare no sacrifice to fight for the liberation of Taiwan! We must unite and take practical actions to smash the US imperialist White Paper's despicable conspiracy and challenge!

Faculty and Staff of Tsinghua University Express Their Views on the White Paper
We Must Serve the People with All Our Strength and Wash Away the Shame of "Indemnity School"

[Report from this newspaper] The faculty and staff of Tsinghua University expressed their views on the White Paper issued by the US State Department, as follows:
After reading the synopsis of the White Paper issued by the US State Department, we, the faculty and staff of Tsinghua University, have reached the following conclusions: First, this record is a confession of the US imperialism's aggression and massacre of the Chinese people; second, it has helped some of us abandon illusions.

In the past few years, we have constantly issued accusations to the people of the world, accusing the US imperialism of undermining China's sovereignty and interfering in China's internal affairs; accusing the US imperialism of directing its lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, to launch a civil war and massacre the Chinese people; accusing the US imperialism of aiding the Chiang bandits with airplanes, cannons, military materials, and supplies; accusing the US imperialism of illegally stationing troops in various places to commit the atrocities of rape and murder; accusing the US imperialism of imposing new unequal treaties on the Chinese people, such as the Sino-US Commercial Treaty, etc. In short, in the various documents we have repeatedly issued, it has been stated that US imperialism is the most ferocious and despicable enemy of the Chinese people. If the US imperialism does not withdraw from China, the Chinese people will not be able to live a peaceful, prosperous, independent, and free life. And today, the various facts listed in the White Paper, although there are still some incomplete and dishonest places, have in general fully proved that it is not others, but precisely the government that issued the White Paper that is the enemy of the Chinese people. We were right in the past, and after reading the White Paper, we have further enhanced our understanding of the US imperialism.

Secondly, we admit that although we have tried our best in the anti-imperialist and anti-US struggle in the past, it is undeniable that there have been a few people in our camp who have harbored illusions about the US imperialism and about American-style democracy; thinking that the US imperialism is a good friend of China, counting the US imperialism as a friendly country when enumerating the history of imperialist aggression against China in the past hundred years; even in the great three-year People's Liberation War, some people were still holding a third-party attitude, claiming to be liberals, and claiming to be intellectuals who love the American democratic way. It is precisely because of this that the US imperialism is targeting these people, calling them democratic individualists. But Mr. Acheson, you are wrong. Indeed, some of us have made mistakes and harbored illusions in the past, but now, after the great Liberation War and the unprecedented social transformation, we have received the education of New Democracy and have corrected our mistakes, abandoned our illusions, and recognized who are our friends and who are our enemies. Democratic individualism no longer exists in New China, and the publication of the White Paper has made the Chinese people more thoroughly and completely aware of the true face of the US imperialism, and has made the Chinese people more determined and completely to oppose the US imperialism with all their strength. In this sense, it is beneficial to us.

Finally, we want to say that Tsinghua University is the product of the Boxer Indemnity. After massacring the anti-imperialist people of China, the US imperialism also extorted this sum of money and painstakingly returned a small part of it to run this school, attempting to use American-style education to train the liberals they wanted or the intellectuals who could serve the US imperialism. The history of forty years has proved that due to the awakening of the Chinese people and the leadership of the Communist Party, the US imperialism has miscalculated. Most of the talents trained by Tsinghua University serve the Chinese people, and some directly participated in the revolution. When Tsinghua Garden was liberated, we welcomed the People's Liberation Army with the greatest enthusiasm. After the liberation of Beiping, we studied New Democracy with the greatest effort and participated in various works. Today, after reading the White Paper, we must serve the people with all our strength, wash away the shame of "Indemnity School," and make it a truly people's university. We must call on our compatriots with all our strength to abandon illusions, prepare for struggle, streamline and save, strive to support the front, and liberate all of China.

Three Youth Organizations in Ping City
Publish a Letter to the Youth of the City
Eradicate Illusions and Resolutely Fight Against US Imperialism

[Report from Ping City] The Preparatory Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League in Beiping, the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Democratic Youth Federation, and the Beiping Student Union yesterday (25th) published a "Letter to the Youth of the City" regarding the US Imperialist "White Paper" as follows:
The White Paper published by the US State Department, in addition to helplessly admitting the tragic failure of US imperialism's interference in China, also openly exposed the hideous face of its continued aggression against China.

We, the youth of Beiping, had already recognized the aggressive face of US imperialism and resolutely participated in a series of struggles against US imperialism's interference in China's internal affairs, protesting US military atrocities, opposing US support for Japan, and opposing the reactionary rule of the US imperialist running dog, the Kuomintang, even when the aggressive forces of US imperialism and its running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries, in China were still "seemingly powerful." We coordinated with the heroic struggle of the People's Liberation Army to achieve the basic victory of the Chinese revolution today.

"US imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people," "Whatever the enemy fears, we must do; whatever the enemy likes, we must not do." A few people, the so-called "democratic individualists," still harbor illusions about US imperialism and its representatives, such as Marshall and Stuart. They have an unclear understanding of the significance of international assistance. We should learn a lesson from the "White Paper," distinguish between enemies and friends, eradicate all illusions, resolutely stand on the side of the people's democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, and fight against US imperialism.

We believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we will surely be able to smash the US imperialist policy of internal sabotage and external blockade to harm the interests of the Chinese people. The brave and hardworking Chinese people have in the past disregarded all sacrifices, overcome all difficulties, and defeated domestic and foreign reactionaries. Today, the war is about to end, and we will surely work hard to produce, practice thrift, and complete the huge task of economic construction. We will transform China from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, so that the people can have a prosperous life, the motherland can have a solid national defense, and ensure our independence and strength. We will surely achieve victory!

The Unanimous Opinion of the People of Northeast China
Smash the Vicious Tricks of US Imperialism and Resolutely Lean to the Side of the Soviet Union

[Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 25th] People's organizations, workers, and industrialists and businessmen in Northeast China unanimously sternly condemned the US White Paper. Xing Xudong, a first-class model worker of the Northeast Railway Bureau, said: "No matter what conspiracies and tricks US imperialism wants to use, we the working class have our own political party, and we have the wise Chairman Mao, so we can defeat any conspiracy of the invaders. We have the assistance of the international peace and democracy forces headed by the Soviet Union, and this force is particularly strong. Any invader who dares to provoke the Chinese people must suffer defeat." Xing Xishan, a worker at the Mudanjiang Thermal Power Plant, said: "The US imperialists have never had good intentions towards China. Regardless of whether it is a black paper or a white paper, the workers have long recognized their vicious tricks." The Northeast Democratic Women's Federation said in a written statement on the White Paper: "The White Paper wants to provoke Sino-Soviet friendship. We, the 20 million women in Northeast China, solemnly inform the US imperialists that any of your conspiracies have long been seen through by us. From September 18, wasn't it you who encouraged the Japanese imperialists' aggression and actively helped the Japanese bandits with military materials, gasoline, and steel to massacre our Northeast people? After the Japanese surrender, wasn't it you who helped Chiang Kai-shek to massacre us again? For more than seventeen years, how many of our close relatives have we sacrificed? This is a blood debt! On the contrary, the Soviet Union not only personally liberated us from the iron hooves of the Japanese bandits, but now, when you are arming and blockading our coast, attempting to undermine our economic construction, they have also signed a one-year trade agreement with us. We have clearly recognized that the Soviet Union is our good friend of life and death. The 20 million women in Northeast China are determined to unite under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, smash all the conspiracies of US imperialism, and resolutely lean to the side of the Soviet Union." Zhang Ze, deputy director of the Preparatory Committee of the Northeast New Democratic Youth League, said in a statement: "The Northeast youth have clearly seen the vicious face of US imperialism from the White Paper. Regardless of whether it is still attempting to undermine the Chinese people's revolutionary cause from the outside and inside, the Northeast youth have full vigilance." Feng Yinfu, director of the Northeast Student Federation, said: "Now the students in Northeast China have no illusions about US imperialism and its running dogs. In order to defend the people's motherland, we will resolutely give the most severe blow to any conspiracies and tricks of US imperialism!" Li Guojun, vice chairman of the Harbin Municipal Provisional People's Congress, said: "Although the White Paper is more than a thousand pages thick, with a lot of deceptive words, and uses terms such as 'liberalists' and 'democratic individualists' to undermine the unity of the Chinese people, it is destined to fail." Gong Tianmin, a banker in Shenyang, expressed his support for Chairman Mao's famous saying "lean to one side," saying: "Industrial and commercial circles should be vigilant against being used by the US imperialists and closely unite around the People's Government."

    台湾民主自治同盟华北总支部声明
    台湾是天经地义的中国领土
  　台胞定会起来粉碎美帝阴谋
    【本报讯】台湾民主自治同盟华北总支部发表对美帝白皮书的声明，全文如下：
    美国国务院在八月五日所发表的“美国对华关系”的白皮书，是美帝国主义侵略中国一连串的史实。它虽然达一千零五十四页之长，还不是狰狞真相的全部。它不打自招地供认了美国政府在五年间费了二十七亿六千八百万美元，执行对华第三条路线的任务，即明倡合作、暗中帮凶，因此使国民党反动派在一个时期“在军事的成就上和领域的扩张上显然登峰造极”，指挥和发动了国民党匪帮反人民的全面内战。
    但是费心竭力的结果怎样呢？美帝国主义不得不承认在执行对华侵略政策当中，自己创设了灭亡的条件，成了人民解放军的兵工厂，而不可救药的蒋介石却成了运输队长，这使中国人民的力量日益强大，而成为保卫世界和平民主阵营的不可战胜的有力支柱；它要统治中国的美梦终归于泡影，一切落了空。
    但美帝国主义变中国为它的殖民地的野心绝不肯就此干休的。第二次世界大战结束时，美帝国主义为了独霸世界，早就在欧洲、亚洲、美洲企图部署反共反苏、反民主、反和平的三大阵地，中国是它在亚洲选定了的最大基地，尤其台湾是美帝的远东第二道反共防线的心脏部。现在美帝国主义为了补偿这无可挽救的失败，竟然厚颜无耻地公开了新的凶恶阴谋，将最后的希望寄托在“民主个人主义”，企图死灰复燃，为此目的就拼命捧场民族败类。
    但是台湾人民的眼睛是雪亮的，再也不会上当了。尽管代表地主阶级的美帝走狗—廖文毅之辈叫喊“托管”“独立”，但台湾人民早就认清应走的道路。对美帝还抱着幻想的所谓“民主个人主义者”，你们应当清醒过来，美帝国主义正如它自供的那样在奴役着我们，驱使国民党反动派屠杀中国人民；正因为它知道国民党及它在华的势力将要灭亡，所以又在狂吠“太平洋联盟”，加紧在台湾建造飞机场及一切的军事设施，妄想以台湾作为将来开展反中国人民、反世界人民战争的反动堡垒。但是台湾人民将会起来，而且必定会起来，以革命的行动答复他们。
    福州已全部解放，失掉了外围屏障的国民党残余匪帮的最后挣扎基地台湾，现在已完全暴露在人民解放军矛头之前。不管美帝国主义还在捏造什么“台湾在对日和约签订前仍属于日本领土”的荒谬逻辑，台湾是天经地义的中国领土，它是属于中国人民的。我们台胞要紧跟着中国共产党，在毛主席的英明领导下，将不惜一切牺牲为解放台湾而奋斗！我们要团结起来，以实际行动来粉碎美帝白皮书的卑鄙阴谋和挑战！
    清华大学在校教职员发表对白皮书看法
    要以全力为人民服务，湔雪“赔款学校”的耻辱
    【本报讯】清华大学在校教职员，发表对于美国国务院白皮书的看法，文如下：
    我们清华大学的教职员们，在读了美国国务院所发表的白皮书节要以后，所得的结论：第一这个纪录是美帝侵略和屠杀中国人民的供状，第二是美帝帮助我们中间一些人抛弃了幻想。
    过去几年以来，我们曾经不断地向世界各国人民发出控诉，控诉美帝破坏中国主权，干涉中国内政；控诉美帝指使其奴才蒋介石匪帮发动内战，屠杀中国人民；控诉美帝以飞机大炮军火物资援助蒋匪，控诉美帝非法驻军在各地奸淫杀人的兽行，控诉美帝所加于中国人民的新不平等条约，如中美通商条约等等。总之，在我们屡次所发出的种种文件中，说明了美帝国主义是中国人民最凶恶最卑劣的敌人，美帝一天不退出中国，中国人民就一天不能过安居乐业、独立自由的生活。而今天在白皮书里，所列举的种种事实，虽然还有一些不够完全和坦白的地方，但在大体上却已经充分证明了不是别人，洽洽就是发表白皮书的这个政府，是中国人民的敌人。过去我们做对了，在读了白皮书以后更加增强了我们对美帝的认识。
    其次，我们承认虽然过去我们曾经尽力于反帝反美的斗争，也不可否认地在我们阵营中，还有过少数人对美帝存有幻想，对美国式的民主存有幻想；以为美帝是中国的好朋友，在数说近百年帝国主义侵略中国的历史时，把美帝算作友邦；甚至在伟大的三年人民解放战争中，有些人还在抱着第三者的态度，自命为自由主义者，自命为爱好美国民主方式的知识分子。正是因为如此，所以美帝针对着这些人，称之为民主个人主义者。但是艾奇逊先生，你们错了。诚然我们中间有些人，过去曾经犯过错误，存过幻想，可是现在经过了伟大的解放战争，经过有史以来所未有的社会大变革，我们受了新民主主义的教育，已经改正了错误，抛弃了幻想，认识了谁是我们的朋友，谁是我们的敌人了。民主个人主义这个东西，在新中国已经不存在了，而白皮书的发表，使中国人民更彻底更完全认识美帝的真面目，使中国人民更坚决更彻底用全力来反对美国帝国主义，在这个意义上对于我们是有益的。
    最后，我们要说，清华大学是庚子赔款的产物，美帝在大大屠杀了中国反帝的人民之后，还勒索了这笔钱，又处心积虑退还其中小小一部分，办了这个学校，企图用美国式的教育，训练出他们所要求的自由主义者，或能够为美帝服务的知识分子。四十年来的历史，证明由于中国人民的觉醒，由于共产党的领导，美帝打错了算盘。清华大学所训练出来的人才，大部分是为中国人民服务的，一部分直接参加了革命。在清华园解放的时候，我们以最大的热诚欢迎解放军。在北平解放以后，我们以最大的努力，学习新民主主义，参加各种工作。今天，在读白皮书以后，我们更要以全力来为人民服务，来湔雪“赔款学校”的耻辱，使之成为真正人民的大学。要以全力来号召同胞，抛弃幻想，准备斗争，精简节约，努力支前，解放全中国。

    平市三个青年团体
  　发表告全市青年书
    根绝幻想坚决与美帝斗争
    【平市讯】中国新民主主义青年团北平市筹委会、北平市民主青年联合会筹委会及北平市学生联合会三个青年团体昨（二十五日）为美帝“白皮书”发表“告全市青年书”如下：
    美国国务院所发表的白皮书，除了无可奈何地承认了美帝国主义干涉中国的悲惨失败以外，同时还公开暴露了继续侵略中国的狰狞面目。
    我们北平青年在美国帝国主义的侵略势力和他的走狗国民党反动派在中国还“貌似强大”的时候，就已经认清了美国帝国主义的侵略面目，坚决参加了反对美帝干涉中国内政，抗议美军暴行，反对美帝扶日，和反对美帝走狗国民党反动统治的一连串斗争，配合着人民解放军的英勇斗争取得了今天中国革命的基本胜利。
    “美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌”，“凡是敌人所害怕的，我们一定要作，凡是敌人所喜欢的，我们一定不要作”，对美国帝国主义及其代表人物马歇尔、司徒雷登之流，有少数人即所谓“民主的个人主义者”尚存幻想，对国际援助的意义认识不清。从“白皮书”里我们就应当得出教训，分清敌友，根绝一切幻想，坚决站在以苏联为首的人民民主阵营的一边，与美帝国主义作斗争。
    我们相信：在中国共产党领导下，一定可以粉碎美帝国主义内部捣乱、外部封锁的损害中国人民利益的政策。勇敢勤劳的中国人民过去曾不顾一切牺牲，克服一切困难，战胜国内外反动派。今天战争不久就要结束，我们一定能努力生产、厉行精简节约，完成巨大的经济建设任务。使中国由落后的农业国上升为先进的工业国，人民有富裕的生活，祖国有巩固的国防，保障我们的独立与强盛。我们一定会取得胜利！
    东北人民一致意见
  　粉碎美帝凶恶把戏　坚决倒在苏联一边
    【新华社沈阳二十五日电】东北各人民团体及职工、工商界人士一致严斥美国白皮书。东北铁路局一等模范邢绪东说：“不管美帝国主义要使用怎样的阴谋诡计，我们工人阶级有自己的政党，有英明的毛主席，我们就能够击破侵略者的任何阴谋。我们有着以苏联为首的国际和平民主力量的援助，这个力量是特别强大的。任何敢于向中国人民挑衅的侵略者，一定要遭受失败。”牡丹江火力发电厂工人邢锡山说：“美国帝国主义者对中国始终没安好心。不管黑皮白皮，工人早认清了他那一套凶恶把戏。”东北民主妇女联合会对白皮书的书面谈话称：“白皮书想挑拨中苏友谊。我们东北两千万妇女正告美帝国主义者们，你们任何阴谋诡计都早被我们识破了。从九一八开始，不是你们鼓励日本帝国主义的侵略，积极帮助日本强盗军火、汽油、钢铁来屠杀我们东北人民吗？日本投降之后，不又是你们帮助蒋介石来屠杀我们吗？十七年多，我们牺牲了多少亲骨肉，这是一笔血债！相反的，苏联不但亲手把我们从日寇铁蹄下解放出来，而现在当你们武装封锁我国沿海，企图破坏我们经济建设的时候，又和我们订立了一年贸易协定。我们已清清楚楚认识到苏联是我们生死与共的好朋友。东北二千万妇女誓必团结在中国共产党的领导下，粉碎美帝国主义一切阴谋，坚决倒在苏联这一边。”东北新民主主义青年团筹委会副主任章泽发表谈话说：“东北青年从白皮书里很清楚地看到了美帝国主义的凶恶面目。不管它仍在企图从外部和内部来破坏中国人民革命事业，东北青年都有着充分的警惕。”东北学联主任冯荫复说：“现在东北同学对美帝国主义及其走狗已不存在任何幻想。我们将为了保卫人民的祖国，坚决予美帝国主义的任何阴谋诡计以最严厉的打击！”哈尔滨市临参会副议长李国钧说：“白皮书虽然厚达一千余页，欺骗的话说了一大堆，并用‘自由主义者’‘民主个人主义者’等等名词来破坏中国人民的团结，但它永远是要失败的。”沈阳银行家巩天民表示拥护毛主席“一边倒”这句名言，他说：“工商业界应警惕被美帝国主义者利用，紧密地团结在人民政府周围。”
