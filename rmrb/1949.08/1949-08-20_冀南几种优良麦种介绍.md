II. Characteristics and Features of Several Excellent Wheat Varieties:

1. Guangzong White—The origin is Yangjiafan Village, Guangzong Third District. Based on observation, it resembles a variant of Qida No. 195. The stalk is about three chi tall, with eight or nine branches per plant, and the ear is about three cun long. The awns, glumes, and seed coat are all white. The yield is 15% higher than the best local Bai Mang wheat. The flour is white, and the flour yield is high, but the gluten is weak. In 1946, when various wheat varieties in the area suffered from severe jaundice (rust), Guangzong White was not infected.

In the summer of 1946, the Linqing Farm selected some ears from the place of origin and conducted two years of ear row observation trials at the farm. It was not until 1948 that it was proven to be a superior variety and began to be promoted. This summer harvest has yielded approximately 120,000 jin of seeds, ready for promotion on 15,000 mu.

2. Yulin White—The origin is Shifo Village, Linqing Fourth District. According to observation, it resembles Qida No. 195. The stalk is two and a half to three and a half chi tall, with five to ten branches per plant, and the ear is three cun long, with eighteen to thirty spikelets. The spikelets are loosely arranged, with three to five grains per spikelet. The awns are white and very long. The glumes are tight and white, resistant to wind damage. The grains are slightly round, with a thin, white seed coat, high flour yield, white flour, and weak gluten. It matures three to five days later than ordinary wheat. The stalks turn slightly purple when ripening. The yield is 20% higher than the best local Bai Mang wheat. It has strong growth and yields more than ordinary wheat even in the same dry, waterlogged, alkaline, sandy, and fertilizer-deficient lands. It has never suffered from jaundice in ten years of cultivation in the area.

In the summer of 1948, the Agricultural Department of the Southern Hebei Administrative Office organized the masses to select seeds in Linqing and accidentally discovered this variety. At that time, an investigation was conducted. After observing more than a dozen villages and two to three hundred mu of wheat fields, it was determined to be an excellent wheat variety. The masses were immediately organized to collect seeds, totaling 10,000 jin. In the autumn of the same year, it was promoted on 1,200 mu. This summer harvest has yielded approximately 260,000 jin of seeds, ready for promotion on 32,500 mu.

3. Alkali Wheat—The origin is unknown. The stalk is one and a half to two chi tall. The ear is thick and strong, two cun long, and has awns. Each ear has an average of sixteen spikelets, with three or four grains per spikelet. The leaves are dark green. It has particularly strong drought and alkali resistance. This year, it was trial-planted in several alkaline areas of Wei County and Linqing. It can yield fifty to one hundred jin in land where ordinary wheat cannot grow well at all.

In 1948, the North China Government allocated 900 jin of seeds from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region. In the autumn of the same year, it was trial-planted on 140 mu in Xiaozhuang, Madian, and Linwa in Linqing, and Panguanzhai in Wei County.

This summer harvest has yielded 5,400 jin of seeds, ready for promotion on 650 mu.

4. Chengci Yang Wheat—It is quite common in the Matou Town area of Chengci County. According to observation, it resembles the Xiuzi wheat from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region. The stalk is one and a half to two and a half chi tall, the leaves are wide, the ear is wide and flat, and it has awns. The spikelets are arranged oppositely. The awns, glumes, and seed coat are all amber-colored. It has extremely strong resistance to jaundice and matures five or six days earlier than ordinary wheat. However, it is susceptible to wind damage. The yield is 25% higher than the local Hong Hulu Tou wheat.

During this summer's harvest, comrades from the Handan Farm and the Chengci County Agricultural Science Department organized the masses to select seeds in Chengci and found that many people in the Matou Town area were growing this wheat, and the growth was very good. At that time, a large number of wheat ears were collected as samples, and its advantages and yields were printed on the instruction manual, which was placed in an envelope along with the wheat ear and distributed to the people in each district and village, asking them to compare the ears and grains. They were also invited to visit the production area and discuss seed selection issues. At that time, a warm request for seed exchange from the masses in various districts was quickly received. Following this sentiment, seed selection work was arranged. This summer has yielded approximately 100,000 jin of seeds, ready for promotion on 12,000 mu.

III. Estimated Prospects for Several Excellent Wheat Varieties:

1. Yulin White and Guangzong White are developing the fastest, especially Yulin White. These two varieties are suitable for the general climate and soil conditions in Southern Hebei. Although the gluten is weak, the people of Southern Hebei mostly eat steamed buns and less noodles, so this shortcoming does not hinder the local people's lives.

When the promotion began last year, only a few people reluctantly accepted with skepticism. But this year, the excellence of these varieties has been proven, and many farmers are very grateful to those who promoted these wheat varieties to them. During the wheat harvest, many people in various places automatically exchanged seeds. The promotion prospects for these two types of wheat are the most promising.

2. Alkali Wheat has gained great trust from the masses since trial planting began in the Southern Hebei Region. According to the people, "Alkali Wheat is the grain for alkaline land. Land that only grows alkali blite and red shrubs can now grow wheat." When we went to various promotion areas to collect seeds, the people requested that all the seeds collected this year be promoted locally. The alkaline land area in Southern Hebei is very large, and it is estimated that at least 20,000 hectares can be planted with Alkali Wheat, so the promotion prospects for Alkali Wheat are also very promising.

3. Chengci Yang Wheat has high yields and resistance to jaundice, which are similar to Yulin White and Guangzong White. However, its short stalks and low wheat straw production (a major feed for cattle) are its shortcomings. Its maturity period is earlier than ordinary wheat. In the western part of the Southern Hebei Region, where autumn frost occurs earlier, this wheat is easy to promote in order to plant a few days earlier after the wheat stubble.

The above four types of wheat are excellent varieties recognized by the broad masses. Future promotion is relatively easy to succeed. Based on the current wheat field situation in Southern Hebei, it is estimated that the promotion of the above four types of wheat in three or four years, Yulin White and Guangzong White can be promoted on a total of 6 million mu, and Alkali Wheat and Chengci Yang Wheat can be promoted on 4 million mu, for a total yield increase of 300 million jin.

IV. Several Experiences:

1. Pure-line breeding work on farms is one of the important research projects of farms and also the foundation for the continuous creation of new varieties in the future. However, the country and the people need to increase production immediately. We cannot confine ourselves to the farm's experimental areas as we did in the past. In the future, farms should pay attention to adopting large-scale observation methods, discovering excellent varieties, guiding the masses to conduct field selection of seeds, and immediately promoting them locally. At present, this is more important. The Guangzong White and Yulin White mentioned above are concrete examples. After the Linqing Farm discovered a large area of ​​Guangzong White in Guangzong, it did not collect a large number of seeds at that time. It was only after two years of ear row observation that it began to promote it. However, the Southern Hebei Agricultural Department discovered Yulin White and quickly adopted the method of "selecting and promoting locally". In the same year it was discovered, it was promoted on 1,200 mu, exceeding five times the development in ten years and the promotion continued to prove itself.

2. Some people say, "Excellent varieties are naturally excellent varieties. As long as they are planted in the ground and the people see that they are good, they will exchange seeds themselves without needing to promote them." Although this statement has some truth, it is basically wrong. Strictly speaking, promotion work is the organizational work of agricultural technology. On the basis of a scattered, individual agricultural economy, planned production increases cannot be completed without relying on promotion work. The promotion of Yulin White mentioned above is a clear example. Yulin White had been planted in Shifo Village, Linqing, for almost ten years before it developed to two or three hundred mu in the nearby dozen villages. However, after it was discovered by the Southern Hebei Administrative Office, it was promoted on 1,200 mu in the same year, exceeding five times the development in ten years. If attention is not paid to strengthening promotion work, the aforementioned increase in grain production of 300 million jin in three or four years will probably not be completed in thirty or forty years.

3. Chinese agriculture has a history of thousands of years. Crop varieties have been naturally eliminated by history, and there are excellent varieties that have not been discovered in various places. Moreover, in the past, several excellent varieties have also been introduced. However, due to insufficient attention to this area, many excellent varieties have been forgotten or buried. Our agricultural workers should go deep into the countryside to conduct investigations and research. It is very possible to discover excellent varieties from the countryside. Aren't the Guangzong White, Yulin White, and Chengci Yang Wheat introduced above good examples?

　　冀南几种优良麦种介绍
    冀南行署农业处  李俊
    一、几种优良麦种：
    为说明广宗白、鱼鳞白、碱麦、洋麦几种品种的优良属性，现在先把这几个麦种今年的产量介绍一下：县　　村　　　户　　亩　　品种　　每亩平均　　每亩平均增产
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　产量（斤）　斤　　％　　备考威县　潘村　　三　　六　　广宗白　一二五　　　　二五　　二五
　　　同　　　—　　—　　普通麦　一○○　　　　——　　——临清　丁村　　四　　十五　鱼鳞白　一二○　　　　二五　　二六

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　能种麦）成磁　马头一带　—　——　洋麦　  一六○　　　　　三○　　二三
　　　同　　　—　　——　普通麦　一三○
    二，几个优良麦种的性状及特点：
    １、广宗白——原产地是在广宗三区杨家樊村。根据观察很象齐大１９５号的变种。杆高三尺上下，每株分八九个杈，穗长约三寸。芒、颖皮、种皮都是白色。产量比当地最好的白芒麦多收百分之十五。面色白、出面多，可是面劲小。一九四六年当地各种小麦都遭受严重的黄疸（锈病）广宗白就没被传染上。
    一九四六年夏，临清农场在原产地选了一些穗，在农场连续作两年穗行观察试验，到一九四八年才证明它是优种而开始推广。今年夏收已收种约十二万斤，准备推广一万五千亩。
    ２、鱼鳞白—原产地是在临清四区石佛村，据观察很象齐大１９５号。杆高二尺半到三尺半，每株分五到十个杈，穗长三寸，小穗十八到三十个。小穗排列较松，每个小穗结实三——五粒。芒白色，很长，颖皮紧白，不怕风磨，麦粒稍圆，种皮薄白，出面多，面色白，面劲小，比普通小麦晚熟三、五天。将成熟的时候，麦杆变成微紫色。产量比当地最好的白芒麦多收百分之二十。生长力强，在同样的旱、涝、碱、砂、缺粪的地里，也都比普通麦多收。在当地裁培十年从来没有过黄疸。
    一九四八年夏，冀南行署农业处，在临清组织群众选种，偶然发现这个品种。当时就进行调查。经过十几个村，二三百亩麦田的观察，确定它是优良麦种。马上组织群众收种，计共收种一万斤。当年秋季就推广一千二百亩。今年夏收已收种约二十六万斤，准备推广三万二千五百亩。
    ３、碱麦—原产地不明。杆高一尺半到二尺。穗粗壮，长二寸，有芒。每穗有小穗平均十六个，每个小穗结实三、四粒。叶深绿色。耐旱耐碱性特别强。今年在威县、临清几个碱地区试种。普通麦绝长不好的地，它也能收五十到一百斤。
    一九四八年华北政府由冀鲁豫区拨运九百斤种籽，当年秋天在临清萧庄、马店、林洼与威县的潘官寨，试种了一百四十亩。
    今年夏收已收种五千四百斤，准备推广六百五十亩。
    ４、成磁洋麦——在成磁县马头镇一带很不少，据观察很象冀鲁豫的岫字麦。杆高一尺半到二尺半，叶宽，穗宽扁，有芒，小穗对生排列。芒、颖皮、种皮都是琥珀色。抗黄疸力极强，成熟比普通小麦早五、六天。但怕风磨。产量比当地红葫芦头多收百分之二十五。
    今年夏收的时候，邯郸农场与成磁县农业科同志，在成磁组织群众选种，发现马头镇一带种这种麦子的很多，生长情形都很好。当时就采大批的麦穗当样子，把它的优点产量，都印在说明书上，连麦穗和说明书一同装在信封里，分发给各区村的老百姓，叫他们比穗看麦粒，还请他们到产地参观，讨论选种问题。当时很快的得到各区群众换种的热烈要求。接着在这种情绪下布置选种工作。今夏已收种约十万斤。准备推广一万二千亩。
    三、几个优良麦种前途的估价：
    １、鱼鳞白与广宗白发展最快，特别是鱼鳞白发展更快。这两个品种，适合冀南一般地区的风土。虽然面劲小，但是冀南群众吃蒸馍的多，吃面条的少，这个缺点，在当地人民生活并不碍事。
    去年开始推广的时候只有少数群众半信半疑的勉强接受。但是今年已证明这个品种的优良，许多农民对推广给他们这种麦子的人非常的感谢。农民在收麦的时候，各地都有很多人自动换种。这两种麦推广前途最有希望。
    ２、碱麦在冀南区开始试种，就得到群众很大的信仰。据群众反映：“碱麦就是碱地粮。向来只长碱蓬红荆的地，现在能长麦子了。”在我们到各推广区收种的时候，群众要求今年收的种籽完全就地推广。冀南碱地面积很大，估计能种碱麦的至少有二万顷，碱麦的推广前途也是很有希望的。
    ３、成磁洋麦，产量大，能抗黄疸，这两点与鱼鳞白，广宗白都差不多。但是棵低，产麦秸（牛的主要饲料）少，是它的缺点，它的成熟期比普通麦早。冀南区西部，秋霜较早地区，为了早种几天麦茬，这种麦子容易推广。
    以上四种小麦，都是得到广大群众公认的优良麦种。今后推广是比较容易成功的。按目前冀南麦田情况估计，以上四种麦种的推广在三、四年内鱼鳞白与广宗白共能推广六百万亩，碱麦与成磁洋麦可推广四百万亩，总共可增产量三万万斤。
    四、几点经验：
    １、农场纯系育种工作，是农场重要研究项目之一，也是将来不断创造新品种的基础。但是国家和人民需要马上增产，我们不能象过去那样把自己局限在农场试验区里。今后农场应该注意采取大量观察的方法，发现优良品种，指导群众进行田间选种，立即就地推广。在目前说这是更重要的。上面说的广宗白和鱼鳞白就是个具体例子，临清农场在广宗发现大片广宗白以后，当时没有大量收种。作了二年穗行观察以后才开始推广，但冀南农业处发现鱼鳞白，就迅速采取了“就地选就地推”的办法，当年发现，当年就推广一千二百亩，头一年就能增产粮食三万六千斤。且在推广继续得到了证验。
    ２、有些人说：“优良品种自是优良品种，只要种在地里老百姓看看好，自己会去换种，不用推就广了”。这种说法虽然有一部分道理，但基本上是错误的。严格的说，推广工作就是农业技术的组织工作。在散漫的，个体的农业经济基础上，计划增产不依靠推广工作，是完不成任务的。上面说的鱼鳞白推广就是明显的好例子。鱼鳞白当临清石佛村已经种了差不多十年的时间，才向附近十几个村发展了二、三百亩。但当被冀南行署农业处发现以后，当年就推广一千二百亩，超过十年发展的五倍。要是不注意加强推广工作，前面所说的在三、四年内增产粮食三万万斤，就是三四十年怕也完成不了任务。
    ３、中国农业有几千年的历史，作物品种受着历史的自然淘汰，各地都有未被发现过的优良品种。并且在过去一个时期，也曾被介绍过若干的优良品种。但由于人们对这方面的注意不够，因此有许多的优良品种被遗忘或埋没了。我们农业工作者，应该深入农村作调查研究，从农村里发现优良品种是很可能的。上面介绍的广宗白、鱼鳞白、成磁洋麦不是很好的例子吗？
