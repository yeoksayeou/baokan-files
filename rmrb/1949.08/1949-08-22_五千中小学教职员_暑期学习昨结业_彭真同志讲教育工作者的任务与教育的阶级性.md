　　Five Thousand Primary and Secondary School Teachers
  　Complete Summer Study Yesterday
    Peng Zhen Speaks on the Tasks of Educational Workers and the Class Nature of Education
    [This Municipality News] The Beiping Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers Summer Study Session held its closing ceremony yesterday (the 21st) at Sitsun Middle School. Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of the Beiping Municipal People's Government, Liu Aifeng, Deputy Minister of Education of the North China People's Government, and Liu @, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, all attended and spoke at the meeting. The more than five thousand primary and secondary school teachers who participated in the study session gained a great deal after more than a month of study. Liu @, Chairman of the General Study Committee, said in his closing remarks: "Through the summer study, Beiping's primary and secondary school teachers have not only been organized organizationally but also ideologically. Everyone has learned some basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism, eliminated or shaken certain reactionary and erroneous views, and at the same time experienced that educational workers must study, and without study, it is impossible to do their work well."
    Comrade Peng Zhen, in speaking about the tasks of educational workers, explained that educational work is the transformer of society. Their current task is to eliminate the ideological enslavement of the Chinese people by imperialism, to eliminate the reactionary educational ideas of feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, to develop New Democratic education, and to promote Mao Zedong Thought. He pointed out that educational workers should be leaders on the ideological front. In response to the question of whether education has a class nature, he replied that education does have a class nature. Our education serves the restoration and development of production and class struggle, that is, it serves to raise the consciousness and unity of the four friends to defeat the three enemies. Therefore, everyone must use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to eliminate old ideas and establish a new outlook on life, the universe, and methods of thought, in order to better serve the people and complete the sacred task of educating the younger generation.
　　Deputy Mayor Zhang and Deputy Minister Liu Call for Assistance to the Government in Eliminating Illiteracy and Changing Old Attitudes and Old Work Styles
    Deputy Mayor Zhang pointed out in his speech that the insights gained from this study should be applied to work and life, and skillfully applied according to actual circumstances. When he spoke about how educational workers should serve the people, he said: the main thing is to conscientiously perform one's duties, study diligently, be responsible to the students, and be responsible to the people, rather than holding a mercenary view and an attitude of perfunctoriness. Because in present-day Beiping, there are still a large number of working people and their children who do not have the opportunity to attend school, he called on everyone to help the government carry out adult literacy classes and education for workers' children, and gradually complete the task of eliminating illiteracy.
    Deputy Minister Liu Aifeng pointed out in his speech that there are two issues that should be paid attention to in future work: First, it is necessary to thoroughly change old work attitudes and styles. Attitudes of dealing with people in the old society, such as mutual flattery, flattering superiors, passively shirking work, and doing just enough for the money, and the mercenary consciousness of getting paid for work are no longer viable. In the future, what is needed is to stand with the people as masters, and honestly do one's own work, and be fully responsible for our next generation. Second, the teaching method should be linked to reality, start from reality, and combine with reality to achieve the goal of better serving the people. This is a fundamental problem that we need to completely solve in our educational thinking, and it requires being good at closely linking the revolutionary tasks of the current stage, the needs of the construction of the new China, and the urgent demands of the people in front of us. He finally pointed out that the glorious posts for primary and secondary school teachers are in small and medium-sized cities and vast rural areas. Various places in North China are requesting to send a large number of primary and secondary school teachers to work. Deputy Minister Liu called on everyone, especially unemployed teachers, to break down unnecessary concerns and actively go to the countryside.
    Xue Chengye, Chairman of the Primary and Secondary School Teachers Union, explained in his closing remarks that 135 teachers from the No. 1 Boys' Middle School study branch and 111 teachers from the Girls' Affiliated Middle School study branch confessed and registered as reactionary party members; in the study session, one-quarter of the total number of young teachers applied to join the New Democratic Youth League. These two facts precisely show the progress made by the primary and secondary school teachers participating in this study session in their studies.

　　五千中小学教职员
  　暑期学习昨结业
    彭真同志讲教育工作者的任务与教育的阶级性
    【本市讯】北平市中小学教职员暑期学习会，于昨（二十一）日在四存中学举行结业典礼。中共北平市委书记彭真同志、北平市人民政府张友渔副市长、华北人民政府教育部刘皑风副部长和市教育局柳＠局长等都莅会讲话。参加学习会的五千多中小学教职员，经过一个多月的学习，收获是很大的。学习会总学委会主席柳＠局长致结业词中说：“经过暑期学习，北平市中小学教职员不仅在组织上而且在思想上，真正的组织起来了，大家学了马列主义的几个基本观点，肃清了或动摇了某些反动的错误的观点，同时更体验了教育工作者必须要学习，不学习就不可能把工作做好。”
    彭真同志在讲到教育工作者的任务时说明教育工作是社会的改造者。他们目前的任务是要扫除帝国主义奴化中国人民的思想，扫除封建主义、官僚资本主义的反动教育思想，发展新民主主义的教育，宣传毛泽东思想。他指出：教育工作者应该是思想战线上的领导者。因为有人问教育有无阶级性，他答复说教育是有阶级性的，我们的教育是为恢复发展生产与阶级斗争而服务的，即为提高四个朋友的觉悟与团结去打倒三个敌人而服务的，因此大家必须要用批评与自我批评的武器来去掉旧的思想，树立新的人生观、宇宙观和思想方法，以期更好的为人民服务，完成教育青年一代的神圣任务。
　　张副市长刘副部长号召协助政府扫除文盲转变旧态度旧作风
    张副市长在讲话中特别指出：要把这次学习所得到的心得，应用到工作和生活中去，根据实际情况，善于运用。他谈到教育工作者应怎样为人民服务时说：主要的是要认真执行自己的业务，认真研究，对学生负责，对人民负责，而不是抱雇佣观点和敷衍塞责的态度。因为现在的北平，还有着广大的劳动人民及其子弟没有机会入学，因此他号召大家帮助政府，进行成人补习和工人子弟教育，逐步完成扫除文盲的任务。
    刘皑风副部长在讲话中指出今后在工作上应注意的两个问题说：第一是要澈底转变旧的工作态度与作风。在旧社会里待人处事的态度，象互相拉拢吹嘘，逢迎上级，消极怠工，敷衍了事以及给几个钱干几个钱事的雇佣意识，现在是吃不开了。今后需要的是以主人翁的资格，和人民站在一道，老老实实的做好自己的工作，对我们的下一代全面负责。第二是教学方法要联系实际，从实际出发，与实际结合以达到更好的为人民服务的目的。这是我们在教育思想上要彻底解决的一个根本问题，就需要善于把现阶段革命的任务，新中国建设的需要和人民眼前身边的迫切要求很好的联系起来。他最后指出：中小学教员光荣的岗位是在中小城市和广大农村，华北各地要求派大批中小学教师去工作。刘副部长号召大家特别是失业的教师，要打破不必要的顾虑，踊跃下乡。
    中小学教职联主席薛成业在闭幕词中说明：男一中学习分会教职员中有一百三十五人和女附中学习分会教职员中有一百一十一个反动党团人员坦白登记；在学习会中有占青年教师总人数四分之一的人申请加入新民主主义青年团。这两个事实，正是表示了参加这次学习会的中小教职员在学习上的进度。
