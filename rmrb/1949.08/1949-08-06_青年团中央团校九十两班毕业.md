    The Graduation of Classes Nine and Ten of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League School
    [This Newspaper's Report] Two hundred and nineteen students from the first term, classes nine and ten (youth worker and youth student training classes) of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League School, held a graduation ceremony at Hebei Normal School in Tianjin on the 4th. Feng Wenbin and Jiang Nanxiang, Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the Central Committee of the League, both attended and spoke. It is reported that most of the students in these two classes were workers from Tianjin. Since the beginning of the semester in Tianjin in early April, after only three months of intensive study, the students' understanding has generally improved. One hundred and eighty of the two hundred and nineteen students newly joined the Youth League, and twenty-three joined the Chinese Communist Party. Now, apart from the ten class students being assigned to work in various places, most of the nine class workers have returned to their original factories to work.
