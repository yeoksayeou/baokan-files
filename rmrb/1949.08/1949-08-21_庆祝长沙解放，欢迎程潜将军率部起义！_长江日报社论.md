　　长江日报社论: Celebrating the Liberation of Changsha, Welcoming General Cheng Qian's Uprising!
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 20th: The Yangtze River Daily editorial: Celebrating the Liberation of Changsha, Welcoming General Cheng Qian's Uprising! The text is as follows:

　　Our million-strong field army, in a massive offensive operation, is advancing valiantly along a wide front of over a thousand miles, pursuing the remaining enemy. In less than a month, it has driven out the Chiang-Bai bandit troops from the vast areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, liberating more than thirty medium and small cities such as Yichang, Shashi, Yueyang, Changde, Ji'an, and Pingxiang, as well as vast rural areas. It has pressed towards the cities of Changsha, Hengyang, and Ganzhou, which the Kuomintang bandit army attempted to hold on to, opening up direct routes to liberate the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan. At this moment, General Cheng Qian, former Chairman of Hunan Province and Director of the Changsha Pacification Headquarters of the Kuomintang, and General Chen Mingren, former Commander of the Kuomintang Corps, and others, led their troops in an uprising, and Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, was also declared liberated. This is a new victory for the cause of the Chinese people's liberation, and it is worthy of our warm celebration!

　　The uprising of General Cheng Qian, General Chen Mingren, and their officers and soldiers is a just act that benefits the cause of the Chinese people's revolution. The people of the whole country warmly welcome their action. From the overall situation, the complete resolution of the Kuomintang's remaining bandit troops and the complete liberation of the country will certainly not take much time or effort. However, the uprising of Generals Cheng and Chen will undoubtedly accelerate the collapse of the remaining Kuomintang forces, shorten the time to end the war, and reduce the suffering of the broad masses of the people. Therefore, their actions are a contribution to the cause of the Chinese people's revolution. At present, the remaining Kuomintang forces are very few in number, and only a small group of bandits, including Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and Yan Xishan, are stubbornly attempting to make a last-ditch struggle. The actions of Generals Cheng and Chen show that even within the remaining Kuomintang forces, there are still people who not only have political foresight but are also willing to break away from the counter-revolutionary camp and join the ranks of the people. As long as they repent, move closer to the people, accept the Chinese Communist Party's Eight Articles and Twenty-Four Clauses of the peace program, resolutely break with American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and continue to work in a direction that benefits the people's cause, then the Chinese people, in view of their self-redemption and self-service behavior demonstrated by their actions, will not only forgive their past crimes but also strive to help them progress. The actions of Generals Cheng and Chen have undoubtedly pointed out this bright path for the remaining Kuomintang forces.

　　The fact that Generals Cheng and Chen and their troops were able to resolutely break away from the dark road and move towards the bright road is by no means accidental. It is the result of the unity and hard work of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Communist Party in their unyielding struggle against the vicious enemies—imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. The bloody rule in China of the last running dog of imperialism, the last dynasty of feudalism, and the most concentrated representative of bureaucratic capitalism—the Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, and Yan Xishan bandit gang—has been basically defeated by us. Under these circumstances, everyone in the remaining Kuomintang forces must make a choice: either refuse to repent and follow the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang into the grave, or turn back to the shore and seek opportunities for self-redemption and self-service. There is no other way. The Chinese people have repeatedly expressed their firm stance: for all war criminals who refuse to repent, no matter where they flee to the ends of the earth, they will be pursued, arrested, and severely punished. However, for all those who are willing to perform meritorious service, even if they have committed crimes in the past, the people will certainly give them the opportunity to redeem themselves. There are not few opportunities, but many, and it depends on each individual's ability to handle themselves and make their choices! In addition to expressing welcome for the uprising of Generals Cheng and Chen, the Chinese people also have earnest expectations, that is, to hope that they will continue to move forward in the direction of moving closer to the people. First of all, it is hoped that the uprising troops will gradually transform themselves in terms of military-civilian relations, officer-soldier relations, and superior-subordinate relations, and become a truly new-style people's army. Secondly, it is hoped that the uprising troops and the original governments at all levels in Hunan Province will protect various public and private industries and materials to prevent them from being damaged, and supervise all personnel working in the original agencies to abide by the policies and decrees of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government, and to perform their duties faithfully. Third, it is hoped that the uprising troops will order their troops to assist the People's Liberation Army and the democratic government in maintaining local social order, preventing chaos, strictly prohibiting all illegal and undisciplined behavior, and carrying out tasks such as suppressing bandits, pacifying the people, and providing disaster relief, and resolutely eliminate all counter-revolutionaries who dare to resist with guns and carry out sabotage activities. It is hoped that Generals Cheng and Chen and their personnel will, in this spirit, strive to eliminate the remaining Kuomintang forces, strive for the rapid liberation of the whole country, and build a new China that is independent, free, prosperous, and strong.

　　庆祝长沙解放，欢迎程潜将军率部起义！
  　长江日报社论
    【新华社汉口二十日电】长江日报社论：庆祝长沙解放，欢迎程潜将军率部起义！文如下：
    我百万野战大军在庞大的攻势作战中，正沿着千余里的宽阔战线，奋勇前进，追击残敌，在不到一个月时间，已于湘鄂赣广大地区驱逐了蒋白匪军，解放了宜昌、沙市、岳阳、常德、吉安、萍乡等三十余中小城市及广大乡村，逼进了国民党匪军图据以负隅顽抗的长沙、衡阳、赣州等城市，开辟了解放粤桂川黔滇诸省的直接道路。正当此时，前国民党湖南省主席长沙绥署主任程潜将军、前国民党兵团司令陈明仁将军等，率领所部举行起义，湖南省会长沙亦随之宣告解放。这是中国人民解放事业的一个新的胜利，值得我们热烈庆祝！
    程潜、陈明仁两将军及其所部官兵的这次起义，乃是有利于中国人民革命事业的一种正义的行为。全国人民对于他们的这一行为是热烈欢迎的。从总的形势方面来说，国民党残余匪军的全部解决，全国的完全解放，固然已经不是需要花费很多时间很多力气的事情了，而程、陈两将军的起义，在这一总的形势下面，无疑地将起加速国民党残余力量的崩溃，缩短结束战争的时间，减少广大人民的痛苦的作用。因此，他们这一行动，对于中国人民革命事业是有贡献的。目前，国民党残余力量已经为数很少，怙恶不悛，力图作垂死挣扎的也仅仅是蒋介石、李宗仁、白崇禧、阎锡山那一小群匪帮。程、陈两将军的行动说明，即在国民党残余力量中，仍不但具有政治远见，且愿意脱离反革命营垒，转入人民行列的人物。只要他们翻然悔悟，靠拢人民，接受中国共产党的八项二十四款和平纲领，与美国帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派坚决决裂，并能继续沿着有利于人民事业的方向努力，则中国人民鉴于他们做出了这种有事实表现的自赎自效行为，不但一定会宽恕其过去的罪责，还要努力帮助其进步。程、陈两将军的行为不啻为国民党残余力量指明了这条光明的道路。
    程、陈两将军及其所部能够毅然脱离黑暗道路，走向光明道路，绝不是偶然的，而是全国人民在共产党领导下，在对凶恶的敌人——帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义进行不屈不挠的斗争中，团结一致，努力奋斗所获致的结果。帝国主义最后一个走狗，封建主义最后一个王朝，官僚资本主义最集中的代表——蒋介石　李宗仁　阎锡山匪帮在中国的血腥统治，已经在基本上被我们打垮了。在这种情况下，国民党残余力量中的每个人都不能不有所选择：或者不自悔悟，跟着蒋介石匪帮走进坟墓，或者回头是岸，寻找自赎自效的机会。其他的道路是没有的。中国人民已经历次表示他们的坚决立场：对于一切怙恶不悛的战争罪犯，不论他们跑到海角天涯，都要追缉到案、严加惩办，而对于凡是愿意立功的人，虽然他过去有过罪行，人民定能给他以自赎的机会。机会不是很少，而是很多，只在每个人善于自处和自择！中国人民对于程、陈两将军的起义行动，除了表示欢迎外，还抱有殷切的期望，即是希望他们向着靠拢人民的方向继续迈步前进。首先是希望起义部队在军民关系、官兵关系、上下级关系等方面逐步改造，变为真正的新式的人民的军队。其次，希望起义部队和湖南全省各级原有政府保护公私各种产业与资材，不使遭受破坏，督责在原来机关供职的一切人员，遵守人民解放军和人民政府的各项政策与法令，并尽忠职守。第三，希望起义部队责令所部协助人民解放军和民主政府，维持当地社会秩序，不使发生混乱，严禁一切违法犯纪行为，并进行剿匪安民救灾等工作，坚决消灭一切敢于持枪抵抗进行破坏活动的反革命分子。希望程、陈两将军及其所部人员，本此精神，为消灭国民党残余力量、争取全国迅速解放、建设独立自由繁荣富强的新中国而努力。
