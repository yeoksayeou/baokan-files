    District-Level Cadres Study Chairman Mao's July 1st Article: Heated Discussions Gradually Deepen

    [This Newspaper] Since the CCP Beiping Municipal Committee called for the study of Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," cadres in various districts of Beiping have been swept up in an unprecedented wave of learning, actively studying this epoch-making great document.

    The study groups of the Fourth District Committee were extremely enthusiastic in their discussions, often arguing incessantly even after the meeting was adjourned. The cadres' study group in the Ninth District ensured sufficient study time, and the air was filled with debate. In addition, cadres in the First, Third, Eighth, and Fourteenth Districts are also moving towards deeper discussion. The study committee compiles questions raised by the study groups, summarizes and organizes them, and then distributes them to the groups for further discussion.

    During the study, a few comrades adopted a perfunctory attitude, saying things like "just get by," "everyone else is talking, I'll say a few words too," "the group leader reads the discussion questions and everyone listens, if there are no objections, we move on," "what's there to discuss, everything in the document is correct?" These comrades more specifically emphasize being busy with work, using it as an excuse to avoid studying, and not getting up on time in the morning. The First District Study Committee pointed out in its study bulletin: This kind of learning attitude is a serious obstacle to learning, and called for criticism and ideological struggle against the "lazybones" in learning, to help these comrades progress.

    When the study was first arranged, some districts did not do a good job. For example, when the Third District started studying, it did not differentiate between political level and education, and divided groups according to work units, which resulted in learning not being in-depth and a lack of communication between upper and lower levels. After extensive discussion and research, a new plan was drawn up: 1. Responsible cadres of the Party and the administration should become the main leaders of the study, and Party and League members should be called upon to take the lead in the study to ensure the completion of the study tasks; 2. Divide into three study groups, A, B, and C, according to political and educational levels; 3. Correct the learning attitude and adhere to the learning system. After this new plan was determined, the comrades' enthusiasm for learning generally increased, and they unanimously believed that strengthening learning and striving to improve themselves is an active attitude of being responsible to the people.

### 各区在职干部  学习毛主席七一论文  热烈讨论逐步深入

    各区在职干部
    学习毛主席七一论文
    热烈讨论逐步深入
    【本报讯】自中共北平市委会号召学习毛主席著“论人民民主专政”以来，平市各区在职干部都卷入了空前未有的学习热潮，积极学习这一划时代的伟大文献。
    四区区委会各学习小组在讨论时情绪极为热烈，往往在宣布散会后，还争论不休；九区的干部学习小组，保证了足够的学习时间，到处是一片争论声。此外第一、三、八、十四等区干部亦正在步向深入讨论阶段，并由学委会汇集学习小组提出的问题，经过综合整理，然后再发给各小组进一步的讨论。
    在学习当中也有少数同志抱着敷衍态度，“应付一下”，“人家都说啦！我也说两句”，“组长念讨论题大家听，没意见就过去”，“文件上说的都对，还讨论啥？”……这些同志更具体的表现是强调工作忙，借故不学习，早晨不按时间起床等。一区学委会在学习通报中指出：这种学习态度是学习的严重障碍，号召向学习上的“懒汉”开展批评与思想斗争，以帮助这些同志进步。
    在刚开始布置学习时，有些区搞得不大好，如第三区开始学习时不分政治水平、文化程度，一律按照工作单位划分小组，加上还没有完全建立起正确的学习态度，以致形成了学习不能深入，上下互不通气的现象。经过广泛讨论研究后又重新订出了计划：一、党和行政负责干部应成为学习的主要领导人，并号召党团员在学习中起带头作用，保证学习任务的完成；二、按照政治、文化水平的不同，划为甲、乙、丙三个学习组；三、端正学习态度，坚持学习制度。这一新的计划确定后，同志们学习热情都普遍提高，并一致认为：加强学习，努力提高自己是积极对人民负责的态度。
