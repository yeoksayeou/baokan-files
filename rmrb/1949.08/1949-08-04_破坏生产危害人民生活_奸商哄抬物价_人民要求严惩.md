    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Recently, a few unscrupulous merchants in this city have been disrupting the market and driving up prices, causing drastic fluctuations in commodity prices in the city over the past three days. The price fluctuations started with flour. On July 30th, each bag of flour cost 10,500 yuan, but the next day it suddenly rose to 13,000 yuan, and on August 1st it rose further to 15,000 yuan. Wheat rose from 155 yuan per jin on July 30th to 180 yuan on July 31st, and then to 207 yuan on August 1st. Coarse grains were also affected by the rise in flour prices, increasing by an average of about 24 yuan per jin per day over the past two days. Judging from the price situation in various places and the specific conditions in this city, there are no factors that should cause such drastic fluctuations in commodity prices. Looking back at the commodity prices in July, prices in this city had risen in early July due to the increase in commodity prices in Shanghai. Recently, commodity prices in Shanghai have stabilized, and the prices of grain and cloth are even lower than in this city. For example, on July 31st in Shanghai, each bolt of "Dragon Head" fine cloth cost 28,500 yuan, and each bag of "Warship" flour cost 8,350 yuan. As for the Tianjin market, which has always had a decisive influence on the market prices in this city, it has also been stable in recent days. Generally speaking, prices are lower than in this city. Prices in Baoding, Zhangjiakou, and around Beiping have also remained unchanged and are lower than in this city. This price fluctuation is obviously not caused by the influence of commodity prices in other cities. In the past few days, there has been continuous rain, and less grain has come from other places. Most of the small grain merchants have sold out their stocks and have some money in hand, which has indeed had some impact on grain prices. However, according to people familiar with the market situation who spoke to reporters, the main reason is that a few unscrupulous merchants saw the above situation and thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of it. As it was the end of the month and employees were being paid, a few unscrupulous merchants stirred up trouble and deliberately drove up prices in order to make huge profits. When the market opened on the 31st, there were not many buyers in the grain market, and their main intention was to buy corn. Later, a few unscrupulous merchants suddenly rushed to buy flour, and the flour mills took the opportunity to raise prices. In addition, some speculative merchants, and even some unscrupulous merchants in other industries, also took the opportunity to hoard flour (such as the Hexing Cloth Shop, which hoarded 300 bags of flour). Some private banks colluded with unscrupulous merchants and also started buying. Analyzing the situation, this price fluctuation is mainly caused by a few unscrupulous merchants causing trouble. The broad masses of people are hoping that the government and state-owned trading companies will give these speculative merchants the punishment they deserve. (Tian)

    [News from Our Newspaper] In recent days, due to unscrupulous merchants hoarding and speculating, driving up prices, commodity prices in Ping City have fluctuated drastically, which has greatly affected the lives of the broad masses of citizens, especially the working people. Workers, students, and people from all walks of life in this city have expressed indignation at this disruptive behavior of speculative merchants and have demanded that the government severely crack down on them, establish more cooperatives, and strengthen the leading role of the state-owned economy. Workers in the Second Sewing Department of the Beiping Clothing General Factory discussed the rising grain prices after receiving their wages on the 1st of this month, saying, "Yesterday, a jin of millet flour was only 135 yuan, but today it is 175 yuan. Every time we get paid, grain prices rise. These past few days, the rain has made it difficult to obtain grain, and the unscrupulous merchants are hoarding desperately. If the government does not crack down on these speculative merchants, the lives of us workers will not be guaranteed." Zhuangzhong, a worker in the sewing department, said seriously, "Unscrupulous merchants, unscrupulous merchants, they will seize any opportunity and exploit any loophole. In my opinion, they must be severely punished." The employees of the Fifth Telephone Bureau held a forum on the price issue a few days ago. Everyone agreed that the price fluctuation was caused by unscrupulous merchants and resolutely supported the government's adoption of strong measures to stop speculative capital from causing trouble and to investigate and deal with unscrupulous merchants. The students who remained on campus during the summer vacation at the Beiping Municipal Normal School, because of this price fluctuation, demanded that the government: 1. Severely punish speculative merchants; 2. Immediately stop the private circulation of silver dollars.
    
    The price fluctuation has also greatly affected vendors and legitimate merchants. Many vendors in the Dongdan Market dare not do business boldly due to rising prices. Tea merchant Wei Zhengsheng said, "Yesterday (July 31st) I sold a pack of tea for ten yuan, but today I can't buy back a pack for that price. How can I make money like this? The unscrupulous merchants who are causing trouble must be severely punished!" Zhang Qingzhong's mother, a food stall vendor, said, "Business is simply too difficult. Yesterday I bought a bag of flour for 14,000 yuan, but today it costs 17,000 yuan." The vendors' unanimous opinion is to demand that the government punish the speculative merchants.

    破坏生产危害人民生活
    奸商哄抬物价
    人民要求严惩
    【本报特讯】本市近有少数奸商捣乱市场，哄抬物价，致三日来本市物价发生剧烈波动。此次物价波动由面粉开始，七月三十日面粉每袋一○、五○○元，次日便突升至一三、○○○元，八月一日更升至一五、○○○元；小麦每斤七月三十日为一五五元，三十一日升至一八○元，八月一日升到二○七元。粗粮受面粉的影响也随着上涨，两日来每天每斤平均上涨二十四元左右。根据各地物价状况及本市具体情况看来，并没有使物价发生如此剧烈波动的因素。回溯七月物价，月初曾因上海物价上涨，本市物价曾随之上升。近来上海物价已趋平稳，粮布价格且低于本市。如上海七月三十一日龙头细布每匹二八、五○○元，兵船面粉每袋八、三五○元，以向来对于本市市场价格起着决定影响的天津市场而言，近几天来也还平稳。一般价格也都低于本市。保定、张家口及北平四周物价也无变化，均较本市为低。此次物价波动，显然并非受其他城市物价影响所致。近几天来连日阴雨，外地来粮较少，小粮商存货大部售出，手里有点余钱，固然对粮价发生一些影响，但据熟习市场情况的人告诉记者，主要还是少数奸商看到上述情况，认为有机可乘，又值月底职工发薪，少数奸商便兴风作浪，故意哄抬物价以谋厚利。三十一日开市时，粮市买客本来不多，且主要心气是买玉米，后突有少数奸商抢购面粉，面粉厂也乘机抬价。另外有些投机商人，甚至有些其他行业的奸商也趁机囤积面粉（如和兴布庄囤积着三百袋面粉），有些私营银号和奸商勾结，亦起而收购。由此情况分析，此次物价波动，主要是少数奸商在那里捣鬼，广大人民都在盼望政府及国家贸易公司给这些投机商人以应有的打击。（田）
    【本报讯】近数日来，由于奸商囤积居奇，投机倒把，哄抬物价，致使平市物价发生剧烈波动，对广大市民特别是劳动人民的生活影响极大。本市工人、学生及各阶层人民对投机奸商这种捣乱行为，一致表示愤慨，纷纷要求政府严厉取缔，广设合作社，加强国营经济的领导作用。北平被服总厂第二缝纫部工人，在本月一号领取工资后，因粮价上涨，议论纷纷说：“昨天小米面才一百三十五元一斤，今天就一百七十五了，每次发工资，粮食就要涨价，这几天下雨，粮源比较困难，奸商就拚命囤积，政府如果不取缔这些投机商人，我们工人的生活就没法保障。”缝纫部工人庄重的说：“奸商，奸商，无空不钻，无孔不入，依我看非严厉惩办不行。”电话五局职工日前开了个物价问题座谈会，大家一致认为物价波动是奸商作怪，坚决拥护政府采取有力措施，制止游资捣乱，查办奸商。北平市立师范暑假留校同学，因为这次物价波动，要求政府：一、严办投机商人；二、立即制止银元私下活动。
    物价波动对于摊贩和正当商人的影响也很大。东单市场好多摊贩因物价上涨，不敢大胆作生意。茶商魏正生说：“昨天（七月三十一日）我卖茶叶一包十元，今天就买不回一包来，这还能赚钱？捣乱奸商非严办不可！”食品摊贩张庆忠母亲说：“买卖简直难做极了，昨天买一袋面粉一万四，今天就要一万七。”摊贩们一致的意见是要求政府惩办投机奸商。
