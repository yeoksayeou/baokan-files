    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: TASS Moscow dispatch: Reuters Moscow correspondent Dallas sent a letter to Alexei, the All-Russian and Moscow Patriarch, on July 21st, regarding the decision of Archbishop Athenagoras of Istanbul to issue an edict excommunicating all those who support Communism, posing the following questions. The questions and Mr. Alexei's replies are as follows: Question 1: Are you aware of the Archbishop's decision to issue this edict? Question 2: What attitude will the Russian Orthodox Church take towards this edict? Answer: Neither I, nor the Religious Council of the Russian Orthodox Church, have any knowledge of the Archbishop's decision to issue an edict excommunicating all those who support Communism. Moreover, neither I nor the Religious Council can imagine that the Orthodox Church could accept a decision that is fundamentally contradictory to the basic principles of Orthodox dogma. Question 3: Do you think there is any contradiction between being loyal to the Soviet state and being loyal to the Russian Orthodox Church? Answer: This question can only have one answer: If believers follow the spirit of the heavenly commandments in the Gospels and the teachings of the Apostles, then there is no, and there cannot be, such a contradiction.

    全俄总主教反对排斥进步教徒
    【新华社北平七日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：路透社驻莫斯科记者达拉斯曾就伊斯坦堡总主教阿瑟诺道鲁斯决定颁布训令，把一切支持共产主义的人逐出教外一事，于七月二十一日致函全俄及莫斯科总主教阿利修斯提出问题。问题与阿氏答复如下：问题一：你获悉总主教关于颁发这一训令的决定吗？问题二：俄罗斯正教教会对这一训令将采取什么态度？答复：不论是我，或者是俄罗斯正教会宗教会议，对总主教决定颁发把一切支持共产主义的人逐出教外的训令一事，都毫无所悉。而且，不论是我或是宗教会议，都不能设想正教教会能接受基本上和正教信条基本原则相矛盾的决定。问题三：你认为忠于苏维埃国家和忠于俄罗斯正教教会两者之间，是否有任何矛盾？答复：这一问题只能有一个答案：如果教徒们遵奉着福音书上的天诫和使徒们的教诲的精义，那就没有、而且不可能有这种矛盾。
