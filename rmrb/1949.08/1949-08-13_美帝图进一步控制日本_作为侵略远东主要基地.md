Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 11th: The American reactionaries are attempting to further control Japan and intensify the suppression of the Japanese people's movement in order to rapidly turn Japan into a major base for the United States to continue its aggression policy in the East, which has already severely failed in China. According to reliable sources from Tokyo, a group of experts from MacArthur's staff has drafted a report on "The United States and Japan Problem" for the US government. The political part of the report proposes the task of the US policy towards Japan and suggests absorbing Japan into the US alliance. The report's authors expressed great alarm at the rise of the post-war Japanese democratic movement, believing that the Communists' influence in Japan has reached a "threatening" level. The report proposes that "effective administrative measures should be taken to reduce the scope of these leftist political activities." The report expressed dissatisfaction with the weakness and incompetence of the Japanese reactionary government under the wings of its American masters, believing that the repeated cabinet crises and short lives of Japanese cabinets prove "the weakness and instability of the post-war Japanese internal political system." The report criticized that "none of the Japanese parties in power have a clear political program, and their policies are incomplete and ill-considered" and have not produced any "true leaders." Based on these excuses, the report calls for Japan to quickly organize a "strong government" and absorb the heads of Japanese militarism from World War II to participate in "leading the country in the struggle against leftists." The report suggests that American advisory groups should be established in all Japanese government agencies.

The economic part of the report proposes "rebuilding the Japanese economy and creating a solid foundation for US-Japan cooperation" in order to realize the interests of American monopoly capital in Asia. The report's authors propose that the United States send industrial delegations to Japan to negotiate long-term contracts with Japanese monopoly companies; and suggest establishing an American-Japanese company in Tokyo to conduct export business to Southeast Asia, stop decentralizing Japanese monopoly companies, and stop purging large enterprises. This suggestion has in fact already been implemented. MacArthur Headquarters announced on the 3rd of this month the "completion" of the work of eliminating financial cliques and decentralizing monopolistic economies. The report suggests that the US government should expand the "Marshall Plan" to Japan. It is not difficult to see that the result of taking these measures will further make the Japanese economy dependent on American monopoly capital and restore its militaristic economic base.

In a section titled "Peaceful Adjustment," the report advocates establishing "formal political cooperation" between the United States and Japan to "maintain the interests of both sides in Asia," and suggests sending an authoritative Japanese delegation to the United States to conduct preliminary negotiations on this issue. This so-called "political cooperation" is clearly related to the US government's conspiracy to delay a peace treaty with Japan and occupy Japan for a long time. According to a United Press report on the 4th, citing Newsweek in New York, the US Navy plans to suggest that Japanese naval ports such as Yokosuka and Sasebo be permanently placed under US management.

### 美帝图进一步控制日本  作为侵略远东主要基地

    美帝图进一步控制日本
    作为侵略远东主要基地
    【新华社上海十一日电】美国反动派正企图进一步控制日本，加紧镇压日本的人民运动，以便迅速把日本变成美国在东方继续实行其在中国已经严重失败的侵略政策的主要基地。据来自东京方面的可靠消息，麦克阿瑟参谋部专家团为美国政府起草了一个“美国与日本问题”的报告。报告的政治部分提出美国对日政策的任务，建议吸收日本参加美国的同盟。报告作者对于战后日本民主运动的高涨表现了极大惊慌，认为共产党人在日本的影响已达到具有“威胁性”的程度。报告提出“应当通过有效的行政措施以缩小这些左倾分子政治活动的范围”。报告对于在其美国主子卵翼下的日本反动政府之脆弱无能，表示不满，认为日本迭次内阁的危机和短命证明“战后日本的内政制度的软弱和不巩固”。报告指摘“日本任何一个在朝的政党没有确切的政纲，其所进行的政策是不彻底的和没有深思熟虑的”并且没有产生任何“真正的领袖”。该报告从这些借口出发，要求日本迅速组织“强有力的政府”，并吸收第二次世界大战中的日本军国主义首脑参加，借以“领导全国对左倾分子作斗争”。报告建议所有日本政府的机构都要设立美国顾问团。
    报告的经济部分提议“重建日本经济，创造美日合作的巩固基础”，这样来实现美国垄断资本在亚洲的利益。报告作者提议美国派遣工业代表团到日本去，与日本的垄断公司谈判，签订长期合同；并建议在东京创办一个进行向东南亚输出业务的美日公司，停止分散日本垄断公司和停止清洗大企业。这个建议事实上早已进行。麦克阿瑟总部于本月三日即已宣布清除财阀和分散独占经济工作的“完成”。报告建议美国政府应当扩大“马歇尔计划”于日本。不难看出，采取这些措施的结果将使日本经济进一步地依赖美国垄断资本，并恢复其军国主义的经济基础。
    报告在题为“和平调整”的一段中，主张建立美日的“正式政治合作”来“保持双方在亚洲的利益”，并建议派遣日本的权威代表团到美国去进行这一问题的预备谈判。这一所谓“政治合作”，显然是与美国政府拖延对日和约、长期占领日本的阴谋有关的。据合众社四日电引纽约新闻周刊消息透露，美国海军方面拟建议将日本的横须贺、佐世保等军港永远划归美国管理。
