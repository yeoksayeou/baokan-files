Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 19th: Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian Province, was completely liberated at 1200 hours on the 17th, with most of the defending enemy forces annihilated. Fuzhou was the largest stronghold of the remnant Kuomintang bandit troops on the southeastern mainland of China, facing Taiwan across the sea. The distance from Fuzhou to Tamsui Port in Taiwan is only 128 nautical miles. The People's Liberation Army advanced on Fuzhou in three routes. A unit of the left-wing Liberation Army liberated Luoyuan County on the 15th, and the defending enemy's 646th Regiment of the 216th Division of the 74th Army, consisting of more than 1,100 men, surrendered completely. On the same day, this route of the Liberation Army occupied key fortresses along the Min River, such as Changmen, Gaotou, Longbing, and Min'an Town. On the afternoon of the 16th, it captured Mawei, an important naval base of the bandits, cutting off the escape route of the Fuzhou defenders along the Min River into the sea. The right-wing Liberation Army, after capturing Yongtai, occupied Honglu Town, 100 *li* south of Fuzhou, on the afternoon of the 15th, and liberated Fuqing County on the morning of the 16th, also occupying Gaokou and Zuochang line. By this point, the Fuzhou defenders' land escape route to Xiamen was also completely cut off. The central route Liberation Army, advancing along the Min River, captured key points along the Min River, such as Baisha, Ganzhe, and Houguan City, on the afternoon of the 15th, and controlled the Zhutingting line, about 30 *li* directly north of Fuzhou. After sweeping away large and small strongholds within a hundred *li* radius around Fuzhou, the Liberation Army liberated Fuzhou in one fell swoop at noon on the 17th.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 19th: A unit of the People's Liberation Army shot down a bandit plane at Danlin Bridge, south of Liling County, Hunan, on the afternoon of the 11th; the fuselage was completely destroyed.

Beijing Xinhua Broadcasting Station Broadcast: Central China Front, 19th Message: The People's Liberation Army on the Guangdong-Jiangxi Front and the South China People's Guerrilla Forces have victoriously joined forces, opening the Guangdong-Jiangxi Corridor and successively liberating the two county towns of Dayu and Xinfeng. The Northward Detachment of the Xiang-E-Gan Column of the South China People's Guerrilla Forces, which persisted in fighting behind enemy lines, crossed the Wuling Mountains and liberated Dayu County, a nationally famous tungsten sand production area on the border of Guangdong and Jiangxi, on the 16th. Part of it even victoriously joined forces with the southward-advancing Liberation Army in Xincheng, north of Dayu, on the same day. When the People's Liberation Army, which had trekked over thousands of mountains and rivers, and the fraternal troops who had arduously persisted in the guerrilla war in South China, joined forces, a burst of cheers immediately erupted. The two sides comforted each other, and triumphal songs soared into the clouds. At the same time, another unit of the Liberation Army liberated Xinfeng County, east of Dayu, at 6:00 AM on the 17th. The Kuomintang bandit army's 96th Division of the 70th Army fled in panic towards Longnan and Anyuan. In addition, the Liberation Army in eastern Hunan Province liberated Anren County, southeast of Hengyang, at 3:00 PM on the 18th.
