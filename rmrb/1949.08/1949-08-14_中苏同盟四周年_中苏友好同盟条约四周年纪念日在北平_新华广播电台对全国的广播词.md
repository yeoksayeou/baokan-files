(I)

Today marks the fourth anniversary of the signing of the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance." This alliance, linking two great nations of the world, is worthy of our faithful adherence and sincere commemoration.

The direct purpose of the Sino-Soviet alliance four years ago was for China and the Soviet Union to collaborate with other United Nations in the war against Japan, and to jointly defend against the resurgence of Japanese aggression after the end of the war against Japan. This alliance has provided us with excellent guarantees on both of these objectives.

First, regarding the joint war against Japan. Six days before the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance on August 14, 1945, on August 9, the Soviet Union had already fulfilled its promise. Just three months after the end of the Soviet-German war, it turned its troops eastward and declared war on Japan. The heroic Soviet Red Army, in coordination with the Outer Mongolian forces and the Chinese people's armed forces, launched a thunderous offensive in three routes against the puppet Manchukuo defense that had been built by Japanese imperialism for fourteen years, and annihilated 764,000 of the elite Japanese Kwantung Army in one fell swoop. Within less than a week, it liberated the entire Northeast. On August 14, the very day the treaty was signed, Japanese imperialism announced its surrender. Do not these past events clearly prove that the Soviet government and the Soviet people unconditionally and faithfully adhered to the alliance between the two countries, and completed a basic task before the treaty was even signed?

Regarding the joint defense against the resurgence of Japanese aggression, this makes us feel that the existence of the Sino-Soviet alliance is even more worthy of celebration today.

After Japan's surrender, American imperialism completely monopolized the control of defeated Japan. Moreover, betraying its promises, and as its entire world policy became more and more reactionary, its control over Japan also became more and more reactionary. Releasing war criminals, preserving financial cliques, canceling reparations, maintaining military production and military bases, disguisedly restoring armaments, supporting reactionary groups, suppressing democratic forces, delaying the peace treaty with Japan... In a word, it is doing its best to revive Japanese aggression as a vanguard for American imperialism, in order to satisfy American imperialism's ambition to dominate the world. Such ambitions have been openly and unscrupulously clamored by American and Japanese imperialists more than once.

The facts are before us that the aggressive forces of Japanese imperialism are indeed showing signs of resurgence under the support of American imperialism. In such a situation, do we not have unparalleled security guarantees from the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, ensuring the close cooperation of our two great nations in a defensive alliance? With the alliance between China and the Soviet Union, there is no doubt that not only can peace in the Far East be guaranteed, but also a significant pillar for lasting peace throughout the world can be established.

(II)

However, strangely enough, such a treaty of alliance, worthy of our faithful adherence and sincere commemoration, was concluded under the initiation of the American government and by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Moreover, at the beginning of its conclusion, the American government and the Kuomintang reactionaries both expressed "universal satisfaction," just as they uniformly express dissatisfaction with the same treaty today. This is quite an interesting matter.

After failing to aid the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek, the American government published a bloated white paper entitled "United States Relations With China" on the 5th of this month, recounting the past five years of American imperialism's aggression against China. It also mentioned the cause and effect of this "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance."

It turns out that this treaty was urgently needed by the American government at the time. American Secretary of State Acheson tells us in the white paper that in early 1945, "the United States Government and people awaited with extreme anxiety the attack on the Japanese mainland, an attack which probably would have cost a million American casualties before Japan could be conquered." In order to avoid these "million American casualties," during the Yalta Conference on February 11, 1945, American President Roosevelt proposed to Soviet Marshal Stalin the conditions stipulated in the later "Sino-Soviet Treaty," hoping that the Soviet Union would send troops. Marshal Stalin agreed to "attack Japan within two or three months after the victory in Europe."

After this agreement was reached, the American side "did not authorize General Hurley to inform Chiang Kai-shek of this agreement until June 15, 1945." Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek, starting in July, dispatched Song Ziwen to Moscow twice for negotiations. Wang Shijie accompanied him on the latter occasion. Finally, on August 14, the treaty of alliance resulting from the negotiations was signed on the Chinese side by Wang Shijie in his capacity as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and on the Soviet side by Foreign Minister Molotov.

Once this treaty was signed, Acheson tells us in the white paper: "Both China under the National Government and the United States expressed universal satisfaction with the agreement that had been completed." Acheson also repeatedly mentioned the Kuomintang reactionaries expressing gratitude to the United States. One instance stated: "Dr. Song Ziwen, the representative of China participating in the negotiations, told U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Harriman that he was very grateful for the assistance of the U.S. Government." Another stated: "Chiang Kai-shek's wife, who was in Washington at the time, visited President Truman to express her gratitude to the U.S. Government for assisting China in negotiating with the Soviet Union."

These words are true, and I myself am a witness. During the entire period of negotiating the "Sino-Soviet Treaty," I happened to be in Moscow. This was because the Soviet Academy of Sciences held its 220th anniversary celebration in June of that year, and I was one of the people invited to participate. As a guest, I stayed in the Soviet Union for a full fifty days. Although I did not know the entire situation of the negotiations, the contents of the treaty were told to me by someone from the Chinese embassy on the night before the treaty was about to be signed, and they said that Song Ziwen and Wang Shijie were very satisfied and considered it a great success.

Most interestingly, the treaty was signed on August 14, and on the 15th, Song Ziwen followed American Ambassador Harriman and flew to London on the same plane, and then to Washington. What does this mean? This undoubtedly means that the triumphant Song Ziwen wanted to go to the British and American governments to take credit, to show that he had "not disgraced his mission." Wang Shijie? He left Moscow on the 16th, flew back to Chongqing via Tehran, Calcutta, on an American plane. Xiong Shihui, Shen Honglie, Jiang Jingguo and others were also on the same route, all representatives who went to Moscow to participate in the negotiations. The only fellow traveler who did not participate in the negotiations was me. They flew back to Chongqing with the original text of the treaty, to go through the approval procedures, and then exchange it in Chongqing. They were welcomed and sent off by Americans along the way, which made them overjoyed and arrogant. This is enough to prove that Acheson's "universal satisfaction" was not false at all.

(III)

It is truly strange! Such a "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship," worthy of our faithful adherence and sincere commemoration, was actually planned by the American government and signed by the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek. At the time of signing, the American government and its running dogs all expressed "universal satisfaction." How should this be explained?

Originally, the American government's wishful thinking was to save "one million American casualties" without spending a single cent of its own. This calculation was completely realized. As soon as the Soviet Union sent troops, the Japanese Kwantung Army was immediately annihilated. Didn't it save more than just "one million" American soldiers? Think about it, if the Kwantung Army was not annihilated, even if the Japanese mainland was occupied, the Japanese could still fight on land, and it is not known when the war could end. In short, saving at least "one million American casualties" without spending a single cent of the United States, this wishful thinking was indeed completely realized.

Secondly, there was an even bigger wishful thinking, which was that according to the American government's calculations, after effortlessly winning the war against Japan, China would still be the China of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and the Northeast would still be the Northeast of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. In this way, the American government could rule China and the Northeast through Chiang Kai-shek.

The American government spared no effort to help Chiang Kai-shek because it had such a larger wishful thinking. Using air, sea, and land transportation, it rapidly transported Chiang Kai-shek's troops, salaries, and equipment to the Northeast. The reactionary General Wedemeyer once boasted that he had completed an unprecedented large-scale troop transport plan. How imposing and menacing the world hegemon was in those years! No matter how forgetful we Chinese are, we have not forgotten it completely, have we?

However, this bigger wishful thinking did not come true at all. Later facts tell us that it was the arduous struggle of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army led by Chairman Mao that not only drove American imperialism and its running dogs out of the Northeast, out of North China, Central China, and East China, but would also drive them out of all of China in the near future. Therefore, the Sino-Soviet alliance was originally just a facade in the hands of the American government and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. Their true intention was not to establish a genuine alliance between China and the Soviet Union. However, the development of history has violated their wishes. The Sino-Soviet alliance is now in the hands of the Chinese people and has gained its true meaning. The People's China and the Soviet Union will undoubtedly form an eternally solid and happy friendly alliance.

(IV)

Just because the ambition to swallow the Northeast suffered a tragic defeat, the "universal satisfaction" of American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek became an empty joy. Thus, they became infuriated and arbitrarily slandered the Soviet Union, and also twisted the Sino-Soviet alliance, which they had planned, signed, and "expressed universal satisfaction" for, in various malicious ways.

One example of these distortions is about Lushun and Dalian. Reactionary elements attempt to compare today's Lushun and Dalian with the Lushun and Dalian occupied by the Tsar and Japan. However, today's Luda is the Luda of the Chinese people themselves. The Soviet Union helped the Chinese people recover Luda, and then helped the Chinese people build Luda, and jointly defend against the new aggression that Japanese imperialism and its supporters are actively planning. May I ask, what is the similarity between this sincere fraternal friendship and the aggressive policies of the Tsar and Japan?

Another example of these distortions is about the independence of Outer Mongolia. I would like to say a few more words on this point. Reactionary elements attempt to incite some Chinese people's Han chauvinistic sentiments to oppose the establishment of an independent and autonomous people's country by the Outer Mongolian people. But may I ask, when Outer Mongolia was attached to China, what benefits did the Chinese people give to the Outer Mongolian people? Wasn't it some Chinese aggressors who sent troops into Outer Mongolia and politically and economically oppressed the Outer Mongolian people, which aroused the Outer Mongolian people's demand to secede from China and become independent? We ourselves are almost unable to protect ourselves under the dual oppression of feudalism and imperialism. Must we force the Outer Mongolian people to be buried with us? Under dual oppression, those of us who are slightly aware know to demand liberation. Shouldn't the Outer Mongolian people have some awareness and shouldn't they have the demand for liberation?

Seriously speaking, the Outer Mongolian people are more promising than us, more aware than us, and more clearly able to be friends with the socialist country of the Soviet Union, and thus received help and were liberated earlier than us. If we stand on a selfless position, we should apologize to the Outer Mongolian people, pay tribute to the Outer Mongolian people, and learn from the Outer Mongolian people. Where is there any reason to follow behind American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries to "resent" the Soviet Union? Furthermore, may I ask, what did the Soviet Union gain due to the independence of Outer Mongolia? Isn't it, like us, only getting a neighboring country?

The question should be - are the Outer Mongolian people happier after Outer Mongolia left us? Facts tell us that the Outer Mongolian people are happier. A person named Bao, who was sent by the Kuomintang government to Kulun a few years ago to monitor the referendum, once published a statement in the newspaper after returning to Chongqing: "Almost every household on the streets of Kulun has a radio." These are the words of the Kuomintang and can be verified in newspapers. After liberation, haven't the lives and production of the Outer Mongolian people been fully improved?

People's China and People's Mongolia should be close brothers in the future. We cannot persist in the backward concepts of suzerainty and dependency. That is not worthy of glory at all!

This April, when our Chinese delegation went to Europe to participate in the World Peace Congress in Prague, Czech Republic, Mr. Tsedenbal, the head of the Outer Mongolian delegation, paid tribute to us for the brilliant victory of our revolutionary war. He said: "When Japanese imperialism dominated the Far East, the Mongolian people were restless. Today, democratic China has become the leader of the East, and we Mongolian people can rest assured from now on."

Look at this frank demeanor of our Mongolian friends. Shouldn't we have the same frankness?

(V)

In short, the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance" is indeed an equal treaty worthy of our faithful adherence and sincere commemoration. At the time the treaty was signed, the Soviet government and the Soviet people had already solidified their true friendship for the Chinese people. Now that we Chinese people have defeated the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries supported by American imperialism, we should even more unreservedly add our Chinese people's true friendship to the Soviet people, promote the solemnity of the treaty, and complete its task.

Today, although Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of American imperialism, has been defeated, American imperialism has not given up. Under the drive of American imperialism, after concluding the aggressive "North Atlantic Treaty" in Western Europe, it is brewing a "Pacific Pact" in the East. American imperialism is not only blatantly supporting the revival of Japanese imperialism, but also blatantly trying to undermine our people's revolution. In the letter to American President Truman when publishing the white paper, Acheson dared to make such a blatant announcement to the world:

"However tragic the situation in China may be in the near future, however cruelly a major portion of China's vast population may be exploited by a party serving the interests of a foreign imperialism, China's long civilization and democratic individualism will ultimately triumph again, and China will ultimately overthrow the alien system. We should encourage all developments in China that are working to achieve this goal now or in the future."

Slandering the Soviet Union as "imperialism" and slandering the Chinese Communist Party as a party "serving a foreign imperialism" is completely a reversal of black and white nonsense - if it were used to describe the relationship between Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism, it would be more appropriate - those do not need to be said. In short, Acheson of the United States, representing American imperialism, representing the bloodsucking bats of Wall Street, declared war on the People's China of our Chinese people: American imperialism wants to make trouble with us to the end!

Therefore, the American white paper is actually a declaration of war on our People's China, which we cannot ignore. The publication of the white paper precisely shows that American imperialism intends to blockade us from the sea. At present, the brewing of the "Pacific Anti-Communist Pact" by Quirino of the Philippines and Syngman Rhee of South Korea, these two small American puppets, and the drowned dog Chiang Kai-shek, is undoubtedly under the secret instigation of American imperialism. The focus of the reactionary policy of American imperialism will be put on the revival of Japanese imperialism, which is a reality clearer than the sun.

"Not shedding tears until they see the coffin," American imperialism's ambitions will not die for a while. It is free to make trouble, but we cannot allow it to make trouble freely.

Aiding Chiang Kai-shek and massacring millions of Chinese people, it is said that this is the "extremely close friendly ties" that American imperialism has given us, which we can never forget.

Now American imperialism is going to support a group of Chiang Kai-sheks again, especially Japanese imperialism, which fought a bloody war with us for eight years, to massacre us Chinese people on a large scale again. Acheson, a not-so-clever Malthusian, doesn't know what he is based on when he says: "China's population doubled in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, thus becoming an unbearable pressure on China. The first problem that a Chinese government must face is solving the people's food problem. So far, no government has succeeded." Thank you for your concern, Acheson. According to you, would it be "successful" to massacre half of the Chinese people again, killing 237.5 million people, wouldn't it? This is not a joke. American imperialism's policy towards China was like this in the past, is like this now, and will still be like this in the future, to step up its efforts towards this goal, "encouraging all developments."

Tell you frankly, Acheson! You are openly encouraging murder! But although we Chinese have a large population, there are not many dregs like Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren. Without your instructions, we will eradicate the dregs completely!

Tell you frankly, Acheson! "The first problem that our Chinese government must face" is indeed "solving the people's food problem." But the reason why the Chinese people's food problem has become a problem is not due to the doubling of the population, but is due to the "unbearable pressure" of foreign capitalism for a hundred years. Foreign capitalism has always colluded with our few dregs to oppress us and carry out heavy extra-economic exploitation. However, we have not been squeezed to death by your exploiters, and we have now turned over. We have overthrown the running dogs of imperialism, and we will also overthrow all the controls of imperialism. Please wait and see, we Chinese people will perform a miracle in the near future: not only will the population not decrease, but it will also increase; not only will eating not be a problem, but we will also eat very well. Why! Because we have removed this large group of blood-sucking parasites from our bodies!

In short, with American imperialism determined to make trouble with us to the end today, determined to drive its big and small running dogs to make trouble with us internally and externally to the end, and determined to massacre half of the Chinese population, we Chinese people cannot but be vigilant.

Chairman Mao has clearly told us in the "July 1st Declaration": We can only "lean to one side" today! "In the international arena, we belong to the anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union. Real friendly assistance can only be sought from this side, and not from the imperialist front."

Recognizing these, we should even more support our Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, double our friendly relations between our two great nations, and we should also expand this friendship and alliance. We should form alliances with all new democratic countries. We should maintain friendship with all new democratic countries and even all peace-loving and democratic people. In this way, relying on the strength of the people of the world, we can break through the imperialist line of aggression and crush the bloody plans of the war-mongers' great massacre.

We have full confidence and dare to accept any arrogant challenge. The power of the people is inviolable. Whoever wants to be a national scum, willingly be a running dog of imperialism, the end of Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, and Yuan Shikai awaits him! Whoever wants to be obsessed and carry out the imperialist policy of aggression, the end of Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo Hideki awaits him!

The wheel of history cannot be reversed. The Pacific must be maintained by the true power of the people to maintain its peace, and human society must have such a glorious and brilliant day to enter the realm of great harmony.

    中苏同盟四周年——中苏友好同盟条约四周年纪念日在北平
    新华广播电台对全国的广播词
    郭沫若
  （一）
    “中苏友好同盟条约”的签订，到今天恰恰是四周年了。这个联结了世界两个伟大国家的同盟，是值得我们忠实信守而且诚恳纪念的。
    四年前中苏同盟的直接目的，是为了中苏两国协同其它联合国对日本作战，而且在对日作战结束之后，还须共同防御日本侵略势力的复活。在这双重的目的上，这个同盟都给予了我们很好的保证。
    首先是共同对日本作战的问题。在一九四五年八月十四日中苏同盟签约之前的六天，八月九日，苏联已经实践了他的诺言，在苏德战争结束之后刚刚三个月，便回师东向，对日本宣战了。英勇无比的苏联红军协同外蒙古部队和中国人民武力，以雷霆万钧的威力，分兵三路，向日本帝国主义经营了十四年的伪满国防进攻，一举而歼灭了日寇精锐所谓关东军七十六万四千人。不足一星期便解放了全东北，就在本条约签字的八月十四日这一天，日本帝国主义便宣布投降了。这些往事不正明确的证明了苏联政府和苏联人民无条件地忠实于两国的同盟，在盟约尚待签字之前，便预先把一项基本任务完成了吗？
    再说到共同防御日本侵略势力的复活。这在今天倒使我们感觉着中苏同盟的存在之加倍的值得庆贺。
    日本投降以后，美国帝国主义把战败国日本的管制权完全垄断了，而且背信弃义，和它的整个世界政策一天一天的走向反动的一样，对日管制也一天一天的走向反动。释放战争罪犯，保留财阀，取消赔偿，维持军需生产和军事基地，变相地恢复武装，扶植反动集团，弹压民主势力，拖延对日和约，……一句话归总，便是尽力想使日本侵略势力复活，作为美帝国主义的先锋队，以满足美帝国主义独霸全世界的野心。这样的野心，由美日帝国主义者明目张胆地、肆无忌惮地，叫嚣了出来，已经不仅一次了。
    事实摆在我们的面前，日本帝国主义的侵略势力，在美国帝国主义的扶植之下，的确有＠＠复活的情势。在这样的情势之下，我们有着中苏友好同盟，保证着我们中苏两大民族以攻守同盟的密切合作来共同防御，不正给予我们以无上的安全保障吗？有了中苏两国的同盟，不仅远东和平可以得到保障，便是全世界的持久和平也可以得到一个重要支柱，那是毫无疑问的事。
  （二）
    但这样一个值得我们忠实信守而且诚恳纪念的同盟条约，说来也很奇怪，却是在美国政府的发起之下，由国民党反动派所缔结的。而且在缔结的当初，美国政府和国民党反动派都表示了“普遍的满意”，和今天他们对同一个条约一致表示不满一样，这倒是一件很有趣的事。
    美国政府在援助反动派蒋介石失败之余，在本月五日发表了一部名叫“中美关系”的臃肿的白皮书，叙述了美帝五年来侵华的经过，中间也提说到这个“中苏友好同盟条约”的前因后果。
    原来这个条约是美国政府在当时所迫切需要的。美国国务卿艾奇逊，在白皮书上这样告诉我们：在一九四五年的初期，“美国政府与人民都以异常焦灼的心情等待对日本本岛的攻击，这场攻击恐怕得支出一百万美国兵员死伤的代价，才可能把日本征服”。就为了要免掉这“一百万美国兵员的死伤”，在一九四五年二月十一日，美国、英国、苏联，在雅尔达举行会议时，便由美国前大总统罗斯福向苏联斯大林大元帅提出了后来的“中苏条约”里面所规定的条件，希望苏联出兵，而斯大林大元帅也就同意了“在欧洲胜利后的两三月以内进攻日本”。
    这个协定成立了之后，美国方面“直到一九四五年六月十五日，才授权赫尔利将军把这个协定通知蒋介石”。于是蒋介石，从七月开始，才先后两次派遣宋子文赴莫斯科进行谈判。后一次是有王世杰同行的。一直到八月十四日，在中国方面即由王世杰以外交部长名义签字于谈判结果的同盟条约，苏联方面的签字者是外长莫洛托夫。
    这一条约一经签定，艾奇逊在白皮书上又告诉我们：“国民政府治下的中国和美国，对于这个业已完成的协定，都表示普遍的满意”。艾奇逊更还一再提到国民党反动派对于美国表示感谢。一则说“中国参加谈判的代表宋子文博士对美驻苏大使哈里曼说，他很感谢美国政府的帮助”。再则说“当时在华盛顿的蒋介石夫人往访杜鲁门总统，对美国政府协助中国与苏联谈判一事表示谢意”。
    这些话都是实在的，我自己就是一个证人。在谈判“中苏条约”的整个时期中，适逢其会，我正留在莫斯科。因为那年六月，苏联科学院举行第二二○周年纪念，我是被邀请去参加的一个人。作为客人，我在苏联留了整整五十天。谈判的整个情形我虽然不知道，但在条约快要签字的头一天晚上，便有中国大使馆的人把条约的内容告诉了我，并且说宋子文、王世杰都非常满意，都认为是一项大成功。
    最有趣的是，条约在八月十四日签字，十五日宋子文便跟着美国大使哈里曼，同机飞往伦敦，再飞华盛顿去了。这是什么意思呢？这毫无疑问就是得意洋洋的宋子文要先去向英美政府表功，表示自己的“不辱君命”。王世杰呢？他是十六日离开莫斯科的，经由德黑兰，加尔加达，以美国飞机飞回重庆。当时同路的还有熊式辉，沈鸿烈，蒋经国等人，都是到莫斯科去参加谈判的代表。唯一没有参加谈判的同行者便是我。他们抱着条约的原文飞回重庆，要经过批准的手续，再在重庆交换，沿途受到美国人的欢迎欢送，使得他们得意忘形，目空一切，那正足以证明，艾奇逊所说的“普遍的满意”一点也没有虚假。
  （三）
    真真是奇怪！这样一个值得我们忠实信守而且诚恳纪念的“中苏友好条约”，才是出于美国政府的策划，而由反动派蒋介石所签定，在签定的当时，美国政府和他的走狗们，都表示了“普遍的满意”。这到底该怎样来说明呢？
    原来美国政府的如意算盘是，不花费自己的一丝一厘，而要救到“一百万美国兵员的死伤”。这算盘是完全如意了。苏联一出兵，日本帝国主义的关东军便立被歼灭，所打救了的美国兵员怕不仅止“一百万”吧？请想想看，关东军如不被歼灭，日本本岛即使被占领了，日帝还可以在陆上作战，战争还不知道在什么时候才可以结束呢。总之，不费美国的一丝一厘便省掉了至少“一百万美国兵员的死伤”，这一如意算盘的确是完全如意了的。
    其次呢，还有更大的一个如意算盘，那便是据美国政府的计算，在对日战争不费力地胜利以后，中国仍然是蒋介石集团的中国，东北也仍然是蒋介石集团的东北，这样美国政府就可以通过蒋介石而统治中国，统治东北。
    美国政府就因为有这样一项更大的如意算盘，所以它拚命帮助蒋介石，用空运海运陆运，把蒋介石的军队饷械飞速火速地运往东北。反动将军魏德迈曾经夸过海口，说他完成了一个有史以来的空前的大运兵计划。世界霸主的神气，在当年是多么的威风凛凛，杀气腾腾，我们中国人无论怎样健忘，总还没有忘记干净吧？
    然而这项更大的如意算盘，却丝毫也没有如意。后来的事实告诉我们，是中国共产党和毛主席所领导的人民解放军的艰苦奋斗，不仅把美帝国主义和它的走狗逐出了东北，逐出了华北华中华东，而且在不久的将来更要逐出全中国了。因此，中苏同盟在美国政府和蒋介石反动派的手中本来只是一个幌子，他们的本意完全不在于建立中苏两国真正的同盟。但是历史的发展却违反着他们的愿望。中苏同盟现在是到了中国人民的手中，获得了它的真正的意义。人民的中国和苏联无疑将结成永远巩固的美满的友好同盟。
  （四）
    就因为吞蚀东北的野心遭了悲惨的失败，美帝国主义和它的走狗蒋介石的“普遍的满意”成了一场空欢喜，于是恼羞成怒，对于苏联任意地加以诽谤，而把它们自己所策划，所签订，所那么“表示普遍的满意”的中苏同盟，也加以种种恶毒的歪曲了。
    这些歪曲中的一个例子是关于旅顺大连的。反动分子企图将今天的旅顺大连与沙皇和日本侵占下的旅顺大连来相提并论。但是今天的旅大是中国人民自己的旅大。苏联帮助中国人民收复了旅大，然后又帮助中国人民建设旅大，并共同防御日本帝国主义及其支持者正在积极策划中的新侵略。请问，这种真诚的兄弟的友谊，与沙皇和日本的侵略政策有什么相同之点呢？
    这些歪曲中的另一个例子是关于外蒙古的独立的。在这一点上我想多说几句。反动分子企图煽动某些中国人的大汉族主义的感情，反对外蒙古人民建立独立自主的人民国家。但是请问，外蒙古附属于中国的时候，中国人对于外蒙古人民究竟给了些什么福利呢？难道不是某些中国的侵略主义者，派兵攻入外蒙古，在政治经济方面压迫外蒙古人民，这才激起外蒙古人民脱离中国而独立的要求吗？我们自己在封建主义与帝国主义双重压迫之下差不多不能自保，难道一定要强迫外蒙古人民跟着我们殉葬吗？我们在双重压迫之下，稍微有点觉悟的人便知道要求解放，难道外蒙古人民就不应该有点觉悟，不应该有解放的要求吗？
    认真说，倒是外蒙古人民比我们争气些，比我们觉悟得早，比我们更清醒地能和社会主义国家的苏联做朋友，因而得到了帮助，而比我们早解放了。我们假如是站在大公无私的立场，我们倒应该向外蒙古人民告罪，向外蒙古人民致敬，向外蒙古人民学习的。更哪里有什么理由跟在美帝国主义和蒋介石反动派的后面，来对苏联“愤慨”呢？再请问，由于外蒙古的独立，在苏联方面究竟得到了些什么呢？岂不是和我们一样，仅仅得到了一个邻邦？
    问题应该是——外蒙古脱离了我们之后，外蒙古人民是不是更加幸福了？事实告诉我们，外蒙古人民是更加幸福了。前几年国民党政府派到库伦去监视公民投票的一位姓包的，事毕回重庆，曾经在报上发表过谈话：“库伦街头差不多每家人家都有了无线电。”这是国民党所说的话，而且是有报可查的。在得到解放之后，外蒙古人民的生活和生产不是都已经充分地提高了吗？
    人民中国和人民蒙古今后应该是密切的兄弟，我们不能够还要固执着那种宗主和藩属的落后观念了。那是丝毫也不足引为光荣的！
    今年四月，我们中国代表团到欧洲去，在捷克的布拉格参加拥护世界和平大会的时候，外蒙古代表团的团长齐登巴尔先生，曾经为我们革命战争的辉煌胜利向我们致敬。他说：“日本帝国主义在远东称霸的时候，蒙古人民是寝息不安的，今天民主中国做了东方的盟主，我们蒙古人民从此可以放心了。”
    请看看蒙古朋友们的这种坦白的风度吧。难道我们不应该有同样坦白的气概吗？
  （五）
    总之“中苏友好同盟条约”实在是值得我们忠实信守而且诚恳纪念的平等条约。在条约签订的当时，苏联政府和苏联人民已经把对于中国人民的真正的友好凝固进去了，我们中国人民在今天已经打败了美帝国主义所支持的蒋介石反动派，更应该毫无保留地把我们中国人民对苏联人民的真正的友好加添进去，发挥条约的庄严性，而完成它的任务。
    在今天美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石虽然打败了，但美帝国主义并没有死心，在美帝的驱使之下，在西欧缔结了侵略性的“北大西洋公约”之后，在东方又在酝酿着“太平洋公约”了。美帝国主义不仅明目张胆地在扶植日本帝国主义的复兴，而且更明目张胆地要破坏我们的人民革命。艾奇逊在发表白皮书时致美国总统杜鲁门的公函里面，竟胆敢向全世界作出这样明目张胆的宣告：
    “在不久的将来，中国的局面无论可能是怎样悲惨，无论中国庞大人口中的一个主要部分可能怎样残酷地处于为一外国帝国主义利益而效力的一个政党的剥削之下，中国的悠久文明和民主个人主义终将再度胜利，中国终将推翻外来的制度。我们应当鼓励在中国的一切发展，这些发展在现在或将来都是为了达到这个目标而工作。”
    诬蔑苏联为“帝国主义”，蔑诬中国共产党为“为外国帝国主义效力”的政党，完全是颠倒黑白的胡说——假如移来表示蒋介石和美帝国主义的关系，那就再洽当也没有了——那些都不用去说它，总之，美国的艾奇逊，他是代表了美帝国主义，代表了华尔街的吸血蝙蝠们，向着我们中国人民的人民中国宣战：美帝国主义要和我们捣乱到底！
    因此，美国的白皮书其实是对于我们人民中国的宣战书，我们是不可忽略的。由于白皮书的公布，正表明了美帝国主义存心要从海上来封锁我们，在目前菲律宾的季里诺和南朝鲜的李承晚，这两个美国小傀儡，同落水狗蒋介石所干的“太平洋反共公约”的酝酿，不用说是出于美帝国主义的暗中指使，而美帝的反动政策的重点更要放在日本帝国主义的复活上，那是比太阳还要明白的现实。
    “不见棺材不流泪”，美帝的野心一时是不会死的，它要捣乱自然有它捣乱的自由，然而我们却不能拱手让他自由自在的捣乱。
    扶助蒋介石，屠杀了我们几百万的中国人民，据说这就是美帝国主义所给予我们的“极密切的友谊联系”，我们是永远不能忘记的。
    现在美帝又要来扶助一群的蒋介石，特别是和我们血战了八年的日本帝国主义，再来大规模地屠杀我们中国人民了。并不十分高明的马尔塞斯主义者的艾奇逊，不知道他何所据而云然，说：“中国的人口在十八、十九世纪中增加了一倍，因此对于中国成为一种不堪重负的压力。一个中国政府必须面临的第一个问题，是解决人民的吃饭。到现在为止，没有一个政府成功”。多谢你艾奇逊的关怀，照着你的说法，那就是把中国人再屠杀一半，杀掉二万万三千七百五十万人，便可以“成功”了，是不是呢？这倒不是笑话，美帝国主义的对华政策，以前就是这样，现在是这样，以后也还是这样，要加紧向着这个目标，“鼓励一切的发展的”。
    正告你，艾奇逊！你是在公开鼓励杀人了！但我们中国人口尽管多，象蒋介石李宗仁那样的败类却没有好几个。不劳你吩咐，败类我们是要把它铲除干净的！
    正告你，艾奇逊！我们“中国政府必须面临的第一个问题”，诚然“是解决人民的吃饭”。但我们中国人民的吃饭之所以成为问题，倒并不是什么由于人口的倍加，而实实在在是由于一百年来外国资本主义的“不堪重负的压力”。外来资本主义一贯勾结我们的少数败类欺压着我们，对于我们作着重重的超经济的剥削。然而我们并没有被你们剥削者榨取到死灭，我们现在是翻身了。我们推翻了帝国主义的走狗，同时还要推翻掉帝国主义的一切控制。你请刮目以待吧，我们中国人民在不久的将来倒要演出一个奇迹：不仅人口不会减少，而且还要加多；不仅吃饭不成问题，而且还要吃得满好。为什么！为了从我们身上已经把你们这一大群吃血蛀虫除掉了！
    要之，有美帝国主义在今天存心要和我们捣乱到底，存心要驱使它的大小走狗们内内外外和我们捣乱到底，而且存心要屠杀我们中国一半的人口，我们中国人民是不能够不加以警惕的。
    毛主席在“七一文告”里面已经明白地告诉了我们：我们今天只能够“一边倒”！“我们在国际上是属于以苏联为首的反帝国主义战线一方面的，真正的友谊的援助只有向这一方面去找，而不能向帝国主义战线一方面去找。”
    我们认明了这些，我们更应该加倍地拥护我们的中苏友好同盟，加倍地增加我们中苏两大民族间的友好关系，而且我们还应该扩大这种的友好和同盟。凡是新民主主义国家，我们都应该和他们缔结同盟。凡是新民主主义国家的乃至一切爱好和平民主的人民，我们都应该和他们保持友好。这样靠着全世界人民的力量来击破帝国主义的侵略的战线，粉碎战争贩子们的大屠杀的血腥计划。
    我们有充分的把握，敢于接受任何狂妄的挑战。人民的力量是不可侮的。谁如要做民族败类，甘心做帝国主义的走狗，谁的面前便有蒋介石、汪精卫、袁世凯的末路在等待着他！谁如要执迷不悟，断行帝国主义的侵略政策，谁的面前也就有希特勒、墨索里尼、东条英机的末路在等待着他！
    历史的车轮是无法扭转的，太平洋必须由真正的人民力量来维持它的太平，人类社会也必须有进到大同境域的那么光辉灿烂的一天。
