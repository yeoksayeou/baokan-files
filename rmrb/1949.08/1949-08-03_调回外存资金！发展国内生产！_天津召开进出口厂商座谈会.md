    Transfer Foreign Capital Back! Develop Domestic Production!
    Tianjin Holds Symposium for Import and Export Businesses
    (Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd) "Transfer the capital deposited abroad to develop domestic production and foreign trade." This was the call made by He Songting, manager of the People's Bank of Tianjin, and Fang Gao, manager of the Bank of China in Tianjin, at the symposium for import and export businesses on the 28th of last month. They unanimously agreed that during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, national industry and commerce could not develop, and some businesses deposited some of their capital abroad out of necessity. Now, under the People's Government's policy of developing production and promoting the economy, it is entirely possible to transfer capital back for production. This would greatly help develop production and foreign trade. They also explained that depositing foreign exchange in the Bank of China, like overseas remittances, can be used at any time as long as it is for legitimate purposes. Many import and export businesses agreed with this call. Before the meeting, Tianjin Renli Industrial Company had already voluntarily transferred 260,000 US dollars in foreign deposits back and deposited them into the Bank of China.

    调回外存资金！发展国内生产！
    天津召开进出口厂商座谈会
    【新华社天津二日电】“调回存在外国的资金，发展国内生产和对外贸易”，这是天津人民银行经理何松亭和天津中国银行经理方皋在上月二十八日进出口厂商座谈会上提出的号召。他们一致认为在国民党反动统治时期，民族工商业得不到发展，有些厂商把一部分资全存在外国，是出于不得已，现在在人民政府发展生产，繁荣经济的政策下，把资金调回就有了充分从事生产的可能。这对发展生产和对外贸易都有很大帮助。他们并说明把外汇存入中国银行，和侨汇一样，只要有正当用途，随时均可动用。许多进出口厂商对这一号召均表同意。在会前，津市仁立实业公司即已自动将国外存款调回二十六万美元，存入了中国银行。
