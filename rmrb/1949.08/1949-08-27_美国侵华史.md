　　I. Aggression Against China by Following or Through Other Countries (Continued from Part 1)
    At that time, the Taiping Rebellion had already flourished. Besieged internally and externally, the Manchu Qing government's rule was in danger of collapse. American aggressors knew that to protect their own interests, it was necessary to support this traitorous government and quickly shifted their policy to helping the Qing government suppress the Taiping movement. As early as 1853 (the third year of Xianfeng) when the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's influence spread throughout the Yangtze River basin, the American Consul in China, Humphrey Marshall, reported to Secretary of State Marcy that the United States' highest interest was to support the Qing government, "rather than watch China become a battlefield of universal anarchy." Although the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom simultaneously sent Hong Rengan to the United States to handle negotiations, it did not achieve any results. In 1860, as soon as the Allied Forces concluded peace with the Qing government, the United States wanted to transport tribute rice by sea to Tianjin to aid the Qing government. In early 1862 (the first year of Tongzhi), with the approval of the American Consul in Shanghai, Shanghai-based Jiangzhe financial magnates Wu Xu, Yang Fang, and others colluded with the American rogue Frederick Townsend Ward to organize the "Ever Victorious Army." In nature, the "Ever Victorious Army" was a tool for the joint intervention of the European and American bourgeoisie in China's internal affairs. Initially, it consisted of Chinese recruited by Britain, the United States, and other countries, with Ward as its center. He possessed modern weapons and was very fierce in battle, becoming a strong enemy of the Taiping Army downstream of Nanjing, forcing Li Hongzhang, the Jiangsu Governor of the Qing government and a traitorous henchman of Zeng Guofan, to "win him over with all his heart." In July and August 1862, Britain and France did not intend to delve deep into the interior to cooperate with the Qing army in combat, while Ward firmly demanded to participate in the capture of Nanjing, the capital of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, in order to develop his political influence and plunder a batch of wealth from the Chinese people. To this end, Li Hongzhang wrote to Zeng Guofan, saying: "Ward saw Hongzhang today and earnestly requested a permit to cooperate in suppressing Jinling, saying that he could arrive in three days, build a gun platform in three days, and attack in three days, and definitely capture the city. After the capture, the city's wealth will be divided among the officers and soldiers!" This was not implemented only because Zeng Guofan resolutely opposed it in order to monopolize the wealth of Nanjing. Later, Ward was killed by the Taiping Army in Cixi. The reactionary rulers of the Manchu Qing Dynasty deeply mourned him, saying, "With such loyalty and bravery, he should be considered a Chinese brave general. It is rare and commendable that he comes from a foreign fugitive." After Ward's death, the "Ever Victorious Army" was again led by the American Henry Burgevine. The US government, through the American Minister to China, Anson Burlingame, negotiated with Yixin (Prince Gong of the Qing Dynasty) to change the "Ever Victorious Army" into the "Central Army," separating it from the relationship with the Jiangsu local government and using it as the foundation for the Qing government's future new army. This plan failed due to Britain's struggle for leadership of the "Ever Victorious Army" and Li Hongzhang's struggle for military power. Burgevine was also "dismissed for causing trouble," and the leadership of the "Ever Victorious Army" fell into the hands of the British Charles Gordon. However, the United States consistently supplied the funds for the "Ever Victorious Army" through its trading houses in Shanghai. Later, when the Qing government demanded a "reduction" of this debt, the United States insisted on "full repayment," and it took nearly twenty years to resolve.
    During the American Civil War of 1861-1865, the North achieved victory, the slavery system was abolished, and capitalism developed rapidly, requiring a more urgent need for foreign markets. Japan also embarked on the capitalist road after the reformist "Meiji Restoration" in 1868 (the seventh year of Tongzhi). Since then, the United States has adopted a policy of aggression against China through Japan. Because Japan could now accommodate American capital and was willing to rely on American political power when developing towards China, the United States happened to meet Japan's demands to use it as a springboard for aggression against China. As early as 1854, US Navy Commander Perry, while cruising in Japan, discovered that "Japan has an important influence on American policy in China." In 1862, American warships bombarded Shimonoseki, obtaining Japan's compromise. In 1866, the United States began proposing to jointly break through the Korean gateway with Japan. By 1868, Perry and Townsend Harris had successively helped Japan open up commerce and plan the Restoration movement. Since then, the United States has carried out a series of aggressions against China through Japan, starting with the invasion of Korea.
    In 1872, taking advantage of Japan's acquisition of the right to station personnel in Korea, the United States sent warships to Korea to forcibly sign a trade treaty with the United States. At that time, Korea actively rejected foreigners and firmly refused American demands. The United States then attacked along the Han River with its navy. Korea was a vassal state of China, and its backward situation was the same as that of inland China. Soldiers still wore iron armor and bamboo helmets, and used weapons such as spears, halberds, arrows, and javelins in combat. However, under the persistence of the Korean people, the American army ultimately failed and its ambitions were not realized. Therefore, it negotiated with Japan, with the United States supplying Japan with a large amount of military supplies, and Japan sending troops to Korea in 1873. China received a secret letter from the United States: "Japan has ordered 80 million Remington breech-loading rifle cartridges in the United States, and is loading two warships in New York, claiming to be at war with Goryeo, and declaring that China is helping Goryeo." The Qing government had no countermeasures, and passively waited for things to change. It happened that Iwakura, Okubo and other Japanese had just returned from foreign countries, advocating that they should first improve their internal affairs, and their discussion was stopped. The American plan to invade Korea through Japan had to be temporarily shelved, and its attention turned to attacking Taiwan.

　　美国侵华史
    刘大年
　　一　追随或通过别国向中国侵略　（续一）
    其时太平天国运动早已蓬勃兴起，在内外夹击下，满清政府的统治很有崩溃危险，美国侵略者深知为了自己利益，有扶持这个卖国政府的必要，迅速把它的政策转而为帮助清廷镇压太平运动。还在一八五三年（咸丰三年）太平天国势力普及长江流域一带时，美驻华领事咸弗列马歇尔对国务卿麦西的报告上就说：美国最高利益，是要支持清政府，“而不是看住中国变成普遍无政府状态的战场”。太平天国虽同时派洪仁＠出使美国办理交涉，却没有得到任何结果。一八六○年联军与清政府的和议刚刚成立，美国便要从海道运漕米到天津接济清政府。一八六二年（同治元年）初，更经过上海美领事同意，由在上海的江浙财阀吴煦、杨坊等，勾结美国流氓华尔组织“常胜军”，“常胜军”在性质上是欧美资产阶级联合过问中国内政的工具，最初由英美等国掺入华人组成，以华尔为中心，他既握有新式武器，打仗又很凶悍，成为太平军在南京下游的劲敌，使清政府江苏巡抚，汉奸刽子手曾国藩的徒弟李鸿章不得不“以全神笼络”。一八六二年七、八月间，英国和法国都没有打算深入内地协同清军作战，而华尔独坚决要求参加对太平天国首都南京的攻略，一面发展其政治势力，同时借此从中国人民身上掳得一批财物。李鸿章为此写信给曾国藩说：“华尔今日见过，谆求鸿章札调协剿金陵，谓三日到，三日扎炮台，三日攻打，定可克城，克后，城中财物与官兵分！”仅因曾国藩为独占南京财富而坚决反对没有实行。后来华尔在慈溪被太平军击毙，满清的反动统治者们非常悼惜，说什么“似此忠勇成性，例以中华骁将，洵已出色当行，得之外国逋臣，尤属难能可贵”云云。华尔死后，“常胜军”复由美国人白齐文（Ｈ．Ａ．　Ｂｌｌｇｅ
　ｖｉｎｅ）统率，美政府更经驻华美使白琳姆（Ｂｕｒｉｎｇａｍｅ（与奕诉（清恭亲王）协议，将“常胜军”改为“中央军”，脱离江苏地方政府的关系，作为清政府将来新军的基础，这个计划因遭到英国争夺“常胜军”领导权与李鸿章争夺兵权的坚决反对而流产，白齐文亦“滋事斥革”，“常胜军”的领导权落到了英国人戈登手里。但对“常胜军”的经费，美国始终经由它在上海的洋行供给，后来清政府对这一笔债款要求“减让”，美国坚持“全还”，拖了将近二十年才算解决。
    一八六一——六五年的美国南北战争，北部取得胜利，奴隶制度被废除，资本主义猛烈向前发展，需要国外市场更加迫切。日本亦于一八六八年（同治七年）经过改良主义的“明治维新”走上资本主义道路。从此美国更采取了通过日本向中国侵略的政策。因为日本此时既能容纳美国资本，且愿在向中国发展时借重美国政治势力，美国正好迎合日本要求把它作为一个侵略中国的跳板。早在一八五四年，美国海军统领皮雷（Ｐｅｒｒｙ）巡行到日本，便发现了“日本对于美国在中国的政策有重要的影响”，一八六二年，美舰炮击马关，取得日本的妥协，一八六六年美国开始提议与日本联合冲破朝鲜门户，至一八六八年先后由皮雷与哈里荡生（Ｔｏｗｎ．Ｓｅｎｄ．Ｈａｒｒｉｓ）帮助日本开辟商务和策划维新运动，自此以后，美国便又通过日本向中国进行一连串的侵略，首先是进攻朝鲜。
    一八七二年美国乘日本取得派员驻札朝鲜权利的机会，派军舰至朝鲜强迫与美国订立通商条约。其时朝鲜积极排外，对美国要求坚决拒绝。美遂以水军沿汉江进攻。朝鲜为中国藩属，落后情形与中国内地相同，士兵还身穿铁甲和头戴竹盔，使用戈矛箭戟一类武器作战。但在朝鲜人民坚持下，美军终归失败，其野心不得逞。于是，与日本商议，从美国供给日本大量军火，由日本于一八七三年向朝鲜出兵。中国得到从美国寄来的密信：“日本在美国定购林明敦后门枪子八千万，在纽约地方装兵船二只，云与高丽构兵，并宣言中国助高丽。”清政府毫无对策，只是消极等待事情变化。恰逢日人岩仓、大久保等新从外国归去，主张先修明内政，其议乃息。美国通过日本侵略朝鲜的计划，只得暂时搁起，而把它的注意力转向于进攻台湾。
