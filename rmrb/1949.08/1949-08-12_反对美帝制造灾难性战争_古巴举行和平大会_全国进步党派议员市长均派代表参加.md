Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 11th: TASS, Havana – The Cuban National Congress for the Defense of Peace and Democracy was held on August 6th and 7th, with more than 2,000 representatives from across the country participating. The organizers of the conference were Professor of Sociology Oliz, former Minister of Labor Girodi, Chairman of the People's Socialist Party (i.e., the Cuban Communist Party) Marlenillo, Secretary-General of the Cuban Workers' Confederation Pana, Chairman of the Cuban Democratic Women's Federation Garcia, poet Quilen, Vice-Chairman of the Cuban People's Party Ocaya, Secretary of the People's Socialist Party Roga, former Minister Without Portfolio Rodriguez, Chairman of the National Federation of Black Organizations Rogas, and many others. Thirty-one senators representing the various provinces of Cuba also attended the conference, and ten mayors sent representatives. The delegates present represented hundreds of people's organizations, including religious groups.

The Chairman of the conference, Oliz, delivered the opening speech, emphasizing the necessity of Cuba's participation in the international peace movement. Other speakers denounced the instigators of war internationally and urged the Cuban people to resolutely oppose any attempt to drag Cuba into another war.

Secretary-General of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, Pana, delivered a speech at the conference on the 7th, stating: The anti-Soviet movement and hysterical war propaganda, as reflected in Cuba, are the destruction of working-class organizations, the assassination of working-class leaders, the dumping of American goods that strangle Cuban industry, increasing unemployment and hunger, the suffering of the Cuban people, and the deprivation of democratic rights. Pana said: Despite these attacks, the Cuban working class is determined to continue fighting for peace under any circumstances. Ms. Graham, the American representative, extended greetings to the conference on behalf of the Progressive Party.

The conference passed a resolution fully endorsing and supporting the declaration of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace in Paris. The resolution refuted the fictitious theory that war is inevitable and resolutely opposed any attempt to lead Cuba onto the path of launching a new world war. The resolution stated: We oppose war and defend the peace that is now under threat. We once again emphasize that we are loyal to the principles of national sovereignty, we oppose all treaties that cede rights and humiliate the nation, oppose the colonialization of our economy, and the surrender of our wealth to foreigners.
