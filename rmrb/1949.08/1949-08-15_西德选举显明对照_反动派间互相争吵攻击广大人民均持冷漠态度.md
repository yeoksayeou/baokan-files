Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 14th: The fierce quarrels among the reactionary parties in West Germany and the widespread indifference of the broad masses form an interesting contrast on the eve of the so-called West German National Assembly elections scheduled for today. According to a report by Diantong News Agency, although the leaders of the West German reactionary parties, the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party, are both representatives who betray the German people and collude with foreign occupying authorities, the upper-level politicians of the two parties never miss any subtle opportunity to attack each other in order to compete for power and profit. Christian Democratic Union Chairman Adenauer and his followers revealed that the Social Democratic Party received British assistance in the election campaign. Social Democratic leader Schumacher retorted, demanding that the Christian Democratic Union guarantee that it would not "sacrifice the interests of the German people for France." Both sides attacked Britain and France, but remained silent about the United States, especially about the occupation fees that depleted West Germany's economy. However, the West German people saw through the deceptive nature of this election and expressed disgust at the quarrel between the two puppets. The Associated Press reported in surprise: Germans in the three occupied zones are "neither interested nor excited" about this "first election in seventeen years." "Housewives in the densely populated Ruhr area are more interested in how to struggle to make ends meet in Germany, where the cost of living is high. Residents of Frankfurt did not know that the election was taking place even after several weeks." The Associated Press also reported: US, British and French observers said: "The unusually small number of participants in the election reflects the growing distrust of most voters in German political leaders."

    西德选举显明对照
    反动派间互相争吵攻击广大人民均持冷漠态度
    【新华社北平十四日电】西德各反动党派间的激烈争吵与广大人民的普遍冷漠是定于今日举行的所谓西德国家议会选举前夕的有趣对照。据电通社报道：西德反动党派魁首的基督教民主党和社会民主党，虽然一样是叛卖德国人民与外国占领当局勾结的代表，但两党上层政客们为了争权夺利，却决不放过任何细微的机会来攻击对方。基督教民主党主席阿登纳及其党徒揭发社会民主党在竞选中受到英国的援助，社会民主党的舒马赫就反唇相讥，要基督教民主党保证所谓“不为法国而牺牲德国人民的利益”。双方都攻击了英法，而对美国则一言不发特别是对耗尽西德经济的占领费绝口不提。但是西德人民看穿了这种选举的欺骗本质，对于两个傀儡的吵架表示厌恶，合众社惊讶地报道：三占区的德国人对此“十七年来的首次选举”，“既不感兴趣，也不兴奋”。“人口稠密的鲁尔区的主妇们对于在生活费高昂的德国如何奋斗使出入相符更感兴趣。法兰克福的居民经过几个星期之后还不知道竞选在进行”。美联社也报道：美英法观察家称：“参加选举人数的异常之少，反映出大部分选举人对德国政治领袖们越来越不信任。”
