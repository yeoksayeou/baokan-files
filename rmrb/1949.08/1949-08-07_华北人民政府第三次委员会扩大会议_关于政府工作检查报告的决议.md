    [Ping City News] The full text of the resolution of the Third Enlarged Meeting of the North China People's Government Committee on the report on the inspection of government work is as follows:
    The Enlarged Meeting of the North China People's Government Committee listened to Chairman Dong Biwu's report on the work of the government, Vice Chairman Bo Yibo's report on financial and economic work, Minister of Justice Xie Juezai's report on political and legal work, Minister of Education Chao Zhefu's report on cultural and educational work, and Deputy Minister of Civil Affairs Lei Renmin's opinions on the current work of establishing political power in rural areas, and hereby makes the following resolutions:
    1. Regarding the work of the government, the committee unanimously agreed with Chairman Dong's report that the government's work implemented the work policy of the Second Meeting of the Government Committee, which centered on production, and achieved the work plan for this period, achieving results in all aspects. The shortcomings of the government's work still include a certain degree of bureaucratic style, a certain degree of paralyzing thoughts regarding the reactionary remnants of the Kuomintang, and formalism in the democratic construction of political power. In general, the achievements are the main thing.
    2. Financial and economic construction work was carried out in a relatively peaceful environment in North China, where the war had ended and continued to support the national war. Although we encountered serious difficulties in the construction process, the achievements were still great, mainly reflected in: In terms of supporting the front, we completed the supply tasks assigned to the North China region by the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the Pingjin and Anyang-Xinxiang Campaigns, ensured the supply for the liberation of Taiyuan, and supported the army's southward and westward advance.
    In terms of economic construction, new liberated cities and industries and mines have mostly recovered; agricultural production has completed the sowing tasks; railways and highways have been vigorously repaired, and traffic and transportation have been rapidly restored. Certain achievements have been made in water conservancy and flood control, supply and marketing cooperation, urban-rural exchanges, foreign trade, and financial price management. However, due to the obstruction and sabotage of the war and domestic and foreign enemies, the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas has not been smooth, and the economic relationship between urban and rural areas is being reorganized, so prices have not yet stabilized. In the future, we must: vigorously overcome financial difficulties, vigorously implement rational simplification of administration and troop reduction, practice thrift, tighten expenditures, call on various technical personnel and party and government staff to go to the countryside to improve rural work, so as to enrich farmers and help cities with grain and raw materials in return, and promote industrial products. We should, step by step, resume and develop industry, agriculture, transportation, trade, cooperation and other undertakings in possible and necessary conditions, giving consideration to their respective priorities. We must vigorously strengthen public security work, protect the people's wealth, prevent floods and protect against risks, reduce and eliminate damage losses, and further increase grain and raw material production. Only by vigorously implementing streamlining and thrift, and accumulating capital, can we free up the strength to carry out economic construction. Only by doing a good job in rural work can we realize the task of centering on the city. These two points must be deeply understood and appreciated.
    3. Regarding political and legal work, since the last committee meeting, local public security has been strengthened; judicial institutions have been generally established, the new judicial spirit is being brought into play, and new laws are being created; the supervision and reporting of cases of illegal and dereliction of duty has widely educated cadres; and other aspects such as social relief, preferential treatment for martyrs, military personnel, and industrial workers, and work for veterans have all achieved remarkable results. The committee believes that although there are shortcomings in the work of democratic construction of political power in rural areas, these shortcomings are shortcomings in progress, and the essence of our democracy is gradually increasing. The key to building political power in the future lies in combining various practical tasks, mobilizing the masses, and making the people's congresses truly become organs of power that unite the masses, concentrate public opinion, and solve problems, and effectively lead and promote various tasks. The tendency of formalism in the past work of building political power must be overcome (here, it has been more or less affected by the formalism of the bourgeoisie), we must strengthen the democratic education of cadres, correct the style of coercion and command, and the successful experiences should be summarized and exchanged in a timely manner, and the work of building political power in rural areas should be carried out under leadership.
    4. In terms of cultural and educational work, the first task was to complete the task of training a large number of cadres. The rectification, restoration and development of primary and secondary school education has adapted to the urgent demands of the broad masses of working people to improve their cultural life. The standardization and improvement of primary school education has prepared for the popularization of education. The shortcoming is that the development and promotion of vocational education and social education still lacks an overall plan, and appropriate attention must be paid to it in the future. Literary and artistic work continues to implement the policy of serving workers, peasants and soldiers, and has new developments in rural areas and factories. There have also been achievements in uniting and transforming old artists. In the work, we must pay attention to close integration with production tasks in the future. In health work, the timely organization and promotion of epidemic prevention and medical treatment has enabled the masses to avoid or reduce the harm of diseases. The achievements and typical experiences obtained show that epidemic prevention work is the main thing, and local health work must be a mass movement, and it must implement the policy of transforming and uniting Chinese and Western medicine in order to be carried out.
    5. The acquisition of all the above achievements is due to the efforts of governments at all levels, especially the masses of the people. As Chairman Dong pointed out: First, our leadership focus has shifted to the cities, but we have not relaxed rural work; second, North China has ended the war, but has not relaxed support for the national war; third, the North China People's Government is about to merge into the united government, but has not slackened its work at all, but has welcomed the arrival of this new situation with a highly responsible spirit and more intensive work. Governments at all levels and the masses of the people should all follow this spirit, successfully complete the tasks ahead on the basis of the achievements already obtained, and prepare for and welcome the convening of the new Political Consultative Conference and the establishment of the united government.

    华北人民政府第三次委员会扩大会议
    关于政府工作检查报告的决议
    【平市讯】华北人民政府第三次委员会扩大会议，关于政府工作检查报告的决议，全文如下：
    华北人民政府委员会扩大会议，听取了董主席必武关于政府工作的报告，以及薄副主席一波关于财经工作的报告，司法部谢部长觉哉关于政法工作的报告，教育部晁部长哲甫关于文教工作的报告，民政部雷副部长任民关于目前农村建政工作的意见后，爰作如下决议：
    一、关于政府工作，委员会一致同意董主席的报告，政府工作是贯彻了政府委员会第二次会议以生产为中心的工作方针，实现了这一时期的工作计划，取得了各方面的成绩。政府工作的缺点，仍然存在着某种程度的官僚主义作风；对国民党反动残余势力某种程度的麻痹思想；对民主建政仍然存在着形式主义。总的来说，成绩是主要的。
    二、财政经济建设工作，是在华北战争已经结束继续支援全国战争的相对和平环境中进行的。在建设过程中虽遭遇到严重的困难，但成绩仍是很大的，主要表现在：支援前线方面，完成了平津及安（阳）新（乡）战役中国人民解放军总部给予华北区的供应任务，保证了解放太原的供给，支援了大军南下与西进的任务。
    在经济建设方面，新解放城市及工矿业，大部恢复；农业生产完成了播种任务；大力抢修铁路公路，迅速恢复通车运输。水利防汛，供销合作，城乡交流，对外贸易，金融物价管理等，均获一定成绩。但由于战争及国内外敌人之阻碍与破坏，城乡内外物资交流尚未顺畅，城乡经济关系正在改组，所以物价尚未臻于稳定。今后必须：大力克服财政困难，厉行合理地精兵简政，节衣缩食，紧缩开支，号召各种技术人员，党政工作人员下乡，把农村工作搞好，以便使农民富裕起来，反回来帮助城市以粮食和原料，并推销工业产品。应分别轻重缓急，有步骤地在可能和必需的条件下，恢复与发展工业、农业、交通、贸易、合作等事业。大力加强治安工作，保护人民财富，防洪护险，减免破坏损失，并进而增产粮食和原料。唯有厉行精简节约，积累资本，才能腾出力量来进行经济建设。唯有把乡村工作做好，才能实现以城市为中心的任务，这两点必须深刻认识与体会。
    三、关于政法工作，自上次委员会以来，地方治安有了加强；司法机构已普遍建立，新司法精神正在发挥，新法律正在创造；对违法失职案件的监察检举，广泛教育了干部；其他关于社会救济，对烈、军、工属的优抚及荣军工作等，均有显著成绩。委员会认为关于农村民主建政工作，虽有缺点，但这些缺点是进步中的缺点，我们民主的实质是在逐步增进中。今后建政要点在于结合各种实际工作，发动群众，使人民代表会议真正成为团结群众、集中民意解决问题的权力机关，有效的领导推动各项工作。过去建政工作中的形式主义偏向必须克服（这里或多或少受了资产阶级的形式主义底影响），必须加强干部的民主教育，纠正强迫命令作风，对成功的经验，应及时总结交流，有领导地进行农村建政工作。
    四、文教工作方面，首先是完成了大批培养干部的任务。中小学教育的整顿、恢复与发展，适应了广大劳动人民提高文化生活的迫切要求。小学教育正规化的提高一步，又为普及教育做了准备。缺点是对职业教育、社会教育的发展推动，尚缺乏全面计划，今后必须予以适当注意。文艺工作，继续贯彻为工农兵服务的方针，在农村、在工厂均有新的发展。团结改造旧艺人，也有成绩。在工作中今后尚须注意与生产任务密切结合。卫生工作，防疫与医疗的及时组织与推广，使群众免于或减少疾病的侵害，在已得的成绩和典型经验中说明：防疫工作是主要的，而地方卫生工作必须是群众运动，并必须是贯彻改造与团结中西医的方针，才能开展。
    五、所有以上成绩的获得，是各级政府特别是人民大众的努力。诚如董主席所指出：我们第一、领导重心转入了城市，但未放松农村工作；第二、华北已经结束了战争，但未放松全国战争的支援；第三、华北人民政府行将合并于联合政府，但对工作毫未松懈，而是以高度负责的精神与更加紧张的工作，来迎接这一新局面的到来。各级政府及人民大众均应本此精神，在已获得的成绩上，胜利地完成今后的任务，准备并迎接新政治协商会议之召开及联合政府之成立。
          一九四九年七月二十七日
