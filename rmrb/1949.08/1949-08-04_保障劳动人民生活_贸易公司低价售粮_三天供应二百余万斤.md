    Trade Company Sells Grain at Low Prices
    Supplies Over Two Million Jin in Three Days
    [Report from this newspaper] During the recent price fluctuations in Beiping, the Beiping Municipal Trade Company fully supplied the factories, government offices, organizations, schools, and some of the working citizens of the city with the food grains they needed, ensuring the stability of their lives. In addition to massively selling food grains and cloth according to market conditions to meet the city's needs and stabilize the market, the company, in order to ensure that the workers and students of public factories, government offices, organizations, and schools, as well as the working citizens, obtain low-priced food grains and are not subjected to the high degree of exploitation by unscrupulous merchants who take the opportunity to raise prices, mobilized all its strength in the three days of July 31, August 1, and 2. The Grain Branch's cooperative wholesale section and twelve business offices and twenty-seven retail stores fully supplied food grains in both wholesale and retail forms. According to statistics from the three days (July 31, August 1, and 2), the total amount of various food grains (including flour, millet, and miscellaneous grains) sold through the cooperative wholesale section to various public factories, worker cooperatives, and government offices, organizations, and schools totaled 1,127,519 jin. Calculating an average purchase of 40 jin per person, over 28,900 workers, staff, and students obtained low-priced food grains, and more than 400 units have already registered and are going through the batch purchase procedures. The various food grains sold to direct consumer citizens through the various business offices and retail stores totaled 919,518 jin. Calculating a purchase of 10 jin per citizen, nearly 100,000 citizens bought low-priced food grains in the three days.
