Youth in Silesia, Poland, are preparing gifts for the Soviet youth delegation, including statues made by foundry workers, the charter of the Communist Youth League, and the charter of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The Polish delegation will carry literary works in Russian, French, and English to Budapest to familiarize world youth with the life and work of Polish youth.

The International Peace Relay Race, held to participate in the World Youth Festival, has begun in France. Relay racers from Britain were welcomed. The relay racers, who bypassed Paris due to French police obstruction, were welcomed by the people of the Paris suburbs. The French football team and forty athletes will accompany the Italian youth delegation to Budapest.

Forty-nine representatives of democratic youth from Vietnam, Madagascar, Morocco, Haiti, South Africa, Egypt, and the Friendly Islands have arrived in Warsaw and are about to go to Budapest.
