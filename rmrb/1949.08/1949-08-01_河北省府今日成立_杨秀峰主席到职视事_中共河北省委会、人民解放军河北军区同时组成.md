    [Ping City News] The Third Enlarged Meeting of the North China People's Government Committee decided to readjust the administrative divisions of North China and approved the appointment of Yang Xiufeng, Luo Yuchuan, Ai Dayan, Li Jihuan, Fan Ruoyi, Li Xier, Yu Li, Sun Wenshu, Zhang Jiguang, Liu Zehua (Yi Ru), Dai Jinong, Tan Yingji, Liu Heyi, Duan Huixuan, Du Peishan, Yao Guotong, Liu Jixing, Liu Yuchen, Xu Zheng, Zhang Qingchun, and Jiang Zhanchun as twenty-one members of the Hebei Provincial People's Government. The Hebei Provincial People's Government was officially established in Baoding on August 1st.
    [Special Dispatch from Baoding by Our Newspaper] The North China People's Government ordered the re-establishment of Hebei Province and appointed members and chairmen and vice-chairmen of the Hebei Provincial People's Government. The Hebei Provincial People's Government was formally established today (August 1st) upon order. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, due to the military division by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs, in order to victoriously strike the enemy and hold the front, Hebei Province had to break the old provincial boundaries and, according to the natural situation and the enemy's division, be divided into the Central Hebei, Eastern Hebei, Southern Hebei, Northern Yue (part), and Taihang (part) administrative regions. This was necessary at the time and played a significant role in defeating the enemy. Now that North China has been completely liberated, in order to adapt to the needs of large-scale production and construction, the North China People's Government specially decided on July 28th to change the administrative divisions of North China, restore the original Hebei Province establishment, establish the Hebei Provincial People's Government, appoint Yang Xiufeng and twenty other people as members of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, and appoint Yang Xiufeng concurrently as the Chairman of the Provincial Government and Luo Yuchuan as the Vice-Chairman. Chairman Yang Xiufeng, Vice-Chairman Luo Yuchuan, and others have assumed their posts and are handling official business.
    [Another Dispatch] According to the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China was proclaimed established on August 1st. The committee consists of twelve comrades, including Lin Tie and Ma Guorui; Comrade Lin Tie is the Secretary, and Comrade Ma Guorui is the Deputy Secretary.
    [Another Dispatch] The Hebei Military Region of the North China Military Region was established upon order. This is the result of the victorious development of the Chinese People's Liberation War. The North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, by order of the Military Commission of the Chinese People's Revolutionary, specially issued an order: appointing Sun Yi as the Commander of the Hebei Military Region of the North China Military Region, Lin Tie as the Political Commissar, Wang Guanghua as the Deputy Commander, Ma Guorui as the Deputy Political Commissar, Li Bo as the Chief of Staff, Wang Qicai as the Director of the Political Department, Wu Erzhen as the Minister of the Supply Department, Li Zhennan as the Political Commissar of the Supply Department, Lin Jinliang as the Minister of the Health Department, and Wu Zhiyuan as the Political Commissar of the Health Department. The Hebei Military Region governs ten military sub-districts, including Tangshan, Tianjin, Tongxian, Baoding, Dingxian, Cangxian, Shimen, Hengshui, and Handan. Under the new situation where the People's Liberation War is about to achieve complete victory throughout the country and North China has been completely liberated, the tasks of the armed forces of the entire province under the leadership of the Hebei Military Region should be: eliminating remaining bandits, maintaining public order, protecting transportation, consolidating national defense, and organizing the people's armed forces to defend the production and construction of the people of Hebei Province.
