    Expanding Tianjin's Grain Supply
    Tianjin Supply and Marketing Cooperative to Purchase Wheat from Distant Areas; 5,000 Bags of Flour Already Shipped to Tianjin from Xinxiang

    [Tianjin News] In order to procure essential goods for its members from distant regions and supplement the grain supply of the trade companies, the Tianjin Supply and Marketing Cooperative has purchased 5,000 bags of flour from Xinxiang Flour Company (of even better quality than Hengzi Tong flour), which were all shipped to Tianjin on the 3rd. In addition, the cooperative has reached an agreement with the Pingyuan Province District Company to purchase wheat in the urban and rural markets of Xinxiang, Neihuang, and Junxian counties, while the district trade company will not purchase in these three counties. The cooperative is planning to send additional cadres to closely cooperate with local industry and commerce departments to carry out large-scale purchases. Farmers in these three counties plant wheat on about 60% of the total area each year, making it a wheat-producing region, and the wheat harvest this year is quite good. The cooperative is also preparing to supply the daily necessities needed by the farmers in these three counties to promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas.
