    Government Sternly Punishes Unscrupulous Merchants
    Li Hanhua Hoarded and Evaded Taxes
    Fined 800,000 Yuan
    Jinchang and Yongan Shops Await Disposition
    [Our Newspaper] This city resident, Li Hanhua, hoarded 550 bags of flour and evaded taxes on the sale of 178 bags. After investigation by the Tax Bureau, the government, in addition to ordering the payment of taxes on the flour already sold, also imposed a fine of over 800,000 yuan. The remaining 372 bags of hoarded flour and the Jinchang and Yongan grain and rice shops involved in this case are still under investigation by the government. From the end of last month to the beginning of this month, the market prices in this city, led by flour, fluctuated. The broad masses of citizens demanded that the government punish speculative merchants. According to the preliminary investigation by the Tax Bureau, a group of illegal merchants has been discovered. One of them is the case of Li Hanhua hoarding 550 bags of flour, which was discovered at the Jinchang Trading Company (grain and rice merchant). Li Hanhua is not a formal merchant. He lives at No. 10 Sanyi Lane, Yongdingmen Inner. On July 2nd, he entrusted Yong'an Rice Shop in Tianqiao to purchase 100 bags of flour from Tongcheng Flour Company; on the 4th, he continued to purchase 200 bags; on July 10th and 14th, he purchased 250 bags from Fuxing Flour Mill; a total of 550 bags have been verified. Until July 30th, 78 bags were retailed through Jinchang Trading Company, and another 100 bags were sold to Jinchang Trading Company at 10,000 yuan per bag. On the same day, Jinchang sold them to Zhicheng Grain and Rice Shop for 10,500 yuan. When Zhicheng went to Fuxing Flour Mill to pick up the goods and returned, he was seized by the Tax Bureau for not having a delivery note. After investigation, the 178 bags that have been sold should be subject to business income tax and stamp tax totaling 54,208 yuan. However, because it is an illegal business that endangers the people's livelihood, it was decided that in addition to paying taxes according to regulations, the business income tax will be fined ten times and the stamp tax will be fined sixty times, totaling a fine of 832,480 yuan, plus tax of 886,688 yuan.
    In addition, Li Hanhua's remaining 372 bags of hoarded flour are still awaiting disposal. The grain merchant Jinchang Trading Company engaged in speculative reselling and shielded merchants from tax evasion; Yongan Rice Shop concealed private merchants hoarding and speculation, and the government will also give them due punishment.                                                                                                                     (Li Ren)

    政府严惩奸商
    李汉华囤积又偷税
    已科罚金八十万元
    晋昌永安两号听候处办
    【本报讯】本市住民李汉华，囤积面粉五百五十袋，偷税卖出一百七十八袋，经税务局查出，政府对已卖面粉除照章饬令补税外，并科罚金八十余万元；尚未售去之囤积面粉三百七十二袋及与本案有关之晋昌、永安两粮米店，政府正在继续审查处理中。上月底至本月初，本市市场以面粉带头物价波动，广大市民曾要求政府惩办投机奸商。经税务局初步调查结果，已发现一批不法商人，其中之一就是在晋昌商行（米面粮商）发现的李汉华囤积面粉五百五十袋一案。李汉华并非正式商人，住永定门内三益里十号，于七月二日托天桥永安米庄购存通诚面粉公司面粉一百袋；四日又续购二百袋；七月十、十四日两次又于福兴制粉厂购存二百五十袋；已查明者前后共五百五十袋。存至七月三十日，由晋昌商行经手零售出七十八袋，另外以每袋一万元售与晋昌商行一百袋，同日晋昌以一万零五百元倒于志成米粮店，志成赴福兴制粉厂提货归来时，因无发货票被税务局查获。查出后，已售妥之一百七十八袋，应纳行商营业所得税及印花税共计五万四千二百零八元，然因其系经营危害人民生活之非法生意，故决定除照章补税外，行商营业所得税加罚十倍，印花税加罚六十倍，合计罚金八十三万二千四百八十元，连税款共计纳八十八万六千六百八十八元。
    此外李汉华尚存之囤积面粉三百七十二袋，尚在听候处理中。粮商晋昌商行买空倒把，包庇行商偷税；永安米店掩护私商囤积居奇，政府亦将予以应得之处办。                （李仁）
