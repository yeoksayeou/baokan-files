    Public Security Headquarters Accepts Workers' Complaint
    Dismisses Team Member Yan Yongchun
    [This newspaper's report] The Municipal Public Security Headquarters recently accepted a complaint from tricycle worker Liu Xueshen and dismissed team member Yan Yongchun, who violated discipline and beat a worker. The incident occurred on July 16th. A team member of the Public Security Headquarters, riding a bicycle in Dongzhimen, violated traffic regulations and collided with a tricycle, breaking three spokes of the tricycle. The team member also fell. After getting up, he took off his belt and beat the tricycle worker Liu Xueshen. After the beating, he rode away. Liu Xueshen sent a letter to the Public Security Headquarters complaining about the incident. After receiving the complaint letter on July 23rd, the Public Security Headquarters immediately investigated and found that it was done by team member Yan Yongchun (originally reorganized from a puppet police officer). He was immediately detained for investigation. He confessed to the facts. Recently, the Public Security Headquarters, considering that Yan Yongchun, despite several months of education after being reorganized, still did not correct his bad behavior, violated traffic regulations, damaged three vehicles, and not only did not compensate or apologize, but instead beat the worker, accepted Liu Xueshen's complaint and expelled him from military service.

    公安总队接受工人控告
    开除队员燕永春
    【本报讯】本市公安总队顷接受三轮车工人刘学身控告，开除违犯纪律，殴打工人的队员燕永春。事件发生于七月十六日，公安总队一队员骑自行车在东直门不遵守交通秩序，与三轮车相撞，撞坏三轮车条三根，该队员亦跌倒，爬起来后即解下皮带殴打三轮车工人刘学身，打后骑车逃跑。刘学身将经过情形投函向公安总队控诉，公安总队于七月二十三日接到控告信后，即进行追查，查出系队员燕永春（原系伪保警改编）所为，当即扣押审查，经其自认属实。顷公安总队以燕永春虽经改编后数月教育，恶劣行为仍不改正，违犯交通秩序，撞坏三辆车不但不赔偿道歉，反而殴打工人，乃接受刘学身控告将其开除军籍。
