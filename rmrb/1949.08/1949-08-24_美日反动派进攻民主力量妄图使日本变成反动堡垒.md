　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 23rd: TASS, Moscow—The Red Star newspaper published an article on the 21st, stating: Recent news from Japan proves that reactionaries are launching further offensives against the democratic rights and living standards of the working people. Under the instructions of MacArthur's headquarters, the Japanese government is carrying out mass layoffs of workers and staff. More than 250,000 people have recently become unemployed. According to a communique issued by MacArthur's headquarters, a total of 1.5 million to 2 million employees are planned to be laid off.

　　The reactionary Yoshida government is systematically lowering wages, raising prices of food and consumer goods, and increasing postage and train fares. MacArthur's headquarters calls this policy of impoverishment, hunger, and unemployment "economic stabilization measures"—what hypocrisy!

　　In fact, as the Soviet representative to the Far Eastern Commission, Pan Youxin, pointed out on July 13th, the American occupation authorities and the Japanese government have, under the pretext of "economic stabilization," actually declared an attack on the democratic forces in Japan. MacArthur and his Japanese puppets are trying to create a huge army of unemployed in Japan as a source of cheap labor for the benefit of Wall Street financial tycoons. They are attempting to destroy the democratic forces in Japan, thereby turning Japan into a reactionary fortress in the Far East.

　　The Red Star newspaper concluded: In carrying out this policy, American imperialism has met with increasingly strong resistance from the Japanese working people. The Japanese working people are responding to the reactionary offensive with large-scale protest strikes. Millions of Japanese employees have participated in the strikes.

　　美日反动派进攻民主力量妄图使日本变成反动堡垒
    【新华社北平二十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：红星报二十一日著文称：最近的日本消息，证明了反动派对劳动人民的民主权利及生活水准，正发动进一步的攻势。日本政府在麦克阿瑟总部的指示下，正在大批解雇工人及职员。最近已有二十五万余人失业。根据麦克阿瑟总部所发表的公报，总共计划解雇一百五十万至二百万职工。
    吉田反动政府正在有系统地压低工资，抬高食品及消费品价格，增高邮资及火车票价。麦克阿瑟总部将这一穷困饥饿和失业的政策，称为“经济稳定措施”，这是何等地伪善！
    事实上，正如远东委员会苏联代表潘友新七月十三日所指出的，美国占领当局和日本政府实际上已在“经济稳定”的借口下，宣布对日本民主力量发动进攻。麦克阿瑟及其日本傀儡正在为着华尔街金融巨头的利益，设法在日本造成一支庞大的失业大军，作为廉价劳动力的来源。他们企图摧毁日本的民主力量，借此使日本变成远东的反动堡垒。
    红星报结语称：美国帝国主义在执行这种政策时，已遭到日本劳动人民的愈来愈强烈的抵抗。日本劳动人民正以大规模的抗议性罢工，来回答反动派的攻势。数以百万计的日本职工，已参加罢工。
