Xinhua News Agency, North Ping [Beiping, now Beijing], August 4th: TASS, New York - A movement to defeat the extremely reactionary Mundt-Ferguson Bill, currently under consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee, is unfolding in the United States. The CIO, AFL, Progressive Party, NAACP, National Lawyers Guild, Communist Party, and other organizations have all announced their opposition to the bill. However, it is reported that the House Judiciary Committee still plans to recommend that Congress enact the bill. Isaacson, Chairman of the Committee Against the Mundt-Ferguson Bill and a New York City Councilor, announced that he had telegraphed the Senate Judiciary Committee, urging it to reject the bill.

    The U.S. Daily Worker called for the most vigorous struggle against the Mundt-Ferguson Bill. The newspaper declared: This bill is even worse than the Mundt-Nixon Bill, which was defeated by mass protests last year. The Daily Worker declared: If this bill is passed, it will not only declare the Communist Party illegal, but it will also "make it impossible for any organization with a progressive program to operate." This bill provides for the establishment of a "Subversive Activities Control Board" - a supreme police state agency to intensify the persecution of anyone who does not strictly adhere to the plans and policies of Wall Street and its agents.

    美国人民展开广泛运动  反对蒙特与费古逊法案
    美工人日报号召坚决斗争
    【新华社北平四日电】塔斯社纽约讯：击败正在参院司法委员会审议的极度反动的蒙特与费古逊法案的运动，正在美国展开。产联、劳联、进步党、全国有色人种协进会、全国律师公会、共产党及其他组织，都曾宣布反对这一法案，但据悉，众院司法委员会仍然计划建议国会订立这一法案。反对蒙特与费古逊法案委员会的主席、纽约市参议员伊萨克逊宣布，他已致电参院司法委员会，力促否决该法案。
    美工人日报号召对蒙特与费古逊法案进行最有力的斗争。该报宣称：这法案甚至比较去年被群众抗议所击败的蒙特——尼克逊法案还要坏些。工人日报宣称：如果这一法案成立，不仅会宣布共产党为非法，而且“会使一切有着进步纲领的组织不能进行活动”。这一法案规定设立“破坏活动调查局”——超等的警察国家机关，以加强迫害运动，来对付任何一个不严格遵守华尔街及其代理人底计划和政策的人。
