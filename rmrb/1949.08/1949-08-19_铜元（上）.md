　　The sky was just beginning to lighten when Hu'er's father crawled out of bed, put on his clothes, and got off the kang (heated brick bed). Hu'er's mother also woke up. Only Hu'er was still fast asleep with his little eyes closed.

　　Hu'er's father was searching here and there for something. Not finding it, he grew a little anxious and turned back to ask Hu'er's mother, "Where did you put the double-pocket bag (Note 1)?"

　　Hu'er's mother said, "Isn't it on that vat?" Then she started to get dressed, preparing to get up.

　　"Where on the vat?" Hu'er's father began to rummage again. He searched the cabinet, under the table, and behind the vat, but the double-pocket bag was nowhere to be found.

　　Hu'er's mother got up and helped to search. She unintentionally opened a drawer and saw several heads of garlic placed there. She thought of the scene of inviting Hu'er's second uncle to eat dumplings yesterday. It kept her busy for most of the day... Suddenly, a thought flashed into her mind, and she quickly said, "Oh! The double-pocket bag is in the kitchen." Yes, the double-pocket bag was in the kitchen. Hadn't she used it to hold green beans yesterday? She had forgotten.

　　"Why didn't you say so earlier, making me search for so long!" Hu'er's father complained as he went out. When he got to the kitchen, he indeed found the half-new, half-old double-pocket bag. While shaking off the dirt, he grumbled unhappily, "Old fool! Old fool!" He had already gone out the gate, but hurriedly returned, saying, "Leave some food for me." Only the sound of the gate "clanging" shut was heard before he left.

　　A little while later, Hu'er woke up. His mother went to cook. Hu'er took out his books from his schoolbag to review his lessons. After reviewing two lessons, he ran to the kitchen to help his mother pump the bellows.

　　When they were eating breakfast, although they waited for a while, his father still didn't return.

　　As luck would have it, they had just put down their bowls when his father returned.

　　"Dad, come and eat." Hu'er greeted him. His father only grunted and went into the house, taking off the heavy, bulging double-pocket bag from his shoulder and placing it on the table.

　　"Dad, what's this?" Hu'er asked.

　　"Copper coins," his father replied.

　　"Where did you get the copper coins?" Hu'er asked.

　　"To be sent to the public (Note 2) factory." his father replied.

　　"What does the factory need these for?"

　　"To make bullets."

　　Hearing this, Hu'er understood: his father was on duty, just like transporting bullets, this time he was transporting copper coins. In reality, that's exactly what it was. Because the route of this transport passed through their village, he had to come back to eat breakfast.

　　Hu'er went to the kitchen to get rice porridge for his father.

　　Seeing Hu'er leave, Hu'er's father stopped eating, untied the double-pocket bag, grabbed a handful of copper coins, and looked at them happily. How delightful these copper coins were! Ever since the Japanese devils attacked, copper coins had become scarcer day by day, and in recent years it was rare to see even a single one. This time, seeing so many was a first for him in his life. Before the war, this handful could buy several feet of cloth. When he was a child, herding sheep for others for a year of hard work would only earn him a handful or two. The more he looked at them, the more he liked them, too bad he didn't have any of his own....

　　Hu'er's father, though a good old man, just liked to take small advantages. Seeing these copper coins, he couldn't help feeling itchy in his heart. He wanted to keep some, but he knew very well that it was wrong, and if the superiors found out, he would be punished. He put the copper coins back in... He grabbed the copper coins again, he thought and thought, thought and thought, finally he put the copper coins into his own pocket...

　　Hu'er had already come in and saw his father putting them into his pocket, and couldn't figure out what was going on. He asked, "Dad, aren't these supposed to be sent to the factory?" His father told him, "Mind your own business."

　　Hu'er was even more puzzled. Seeing the look on his father's face, he didn't ask any more, but he felt that something was wrong.

　　After eating, Hu'er's father wanted to smoke, and asked him to light a fire in the stove, and Hu'er went.

　　After lighting the fire and returning, Hu'er looked at his father's pockets again, and there was nothing left.

　　His father shouldered the double-pocket bag and was about to leave. Hu'er just looked at him, always wondering in his heart: "Where did he put the copper coins?"

　　Hu'er's mother went to wash the pots and bowls.

　　Hu'er was stunned.

　　Hu'er began to look for the copper coins: in the drawer, under the felt mat, in the cabinet, he couldn't find them anywhere. Like his father searching for the double-pocket bag in the morning, he was a little anxious. He was almost dissatisfied with his father.

　　He searched again, and again.

　　Ah! Wasn't that it! The copper coins were neatly lying on the door frame.

　　He thought: Why did Dad keep the public's copper coins? These copper coins are to be sent to the factory to make bullets. If they are not sent to the factory, how can they make bullets? Without bullets, how can we fight the enemy?

　　Hu'er counted the copper coins, a total of sixty-two. He put the copper coins in his own pocket. He decided to hand them over to the public.

　　Hu'er packed the copper coins, put on his schoolbag, and went to school. He wondered whether to hand the copper coins over to the village chief or to the district government? He thought it would be best to hand them directly over to the factory, but where was the factory? He didn't know.

　　Hu'er had to go to school first, and the copper coins in his pocket were heavy and uncomfortable. Moreover, it wouldn't be good if others saw them. If he lost them due to carelessness, wouldn't it be even worse?

　　Hu'er turned a corner, and after walking a few steps, he left the village. He looked around, and there was no one, and he felt relieved. He thought to himself: "Yes, I'll hide them here." He took out the copper coins and put them in a pile of grass. After placing them, he looked around again, there was still no one, but he still wasn't at ease. So, he quickly picked up the money again. He thought: Erdan and the others will come to cut grass, and if they cut it, wouldn't they find it? If the copper coins are taken away by Erdan, then don't expect to get them back. He ran forward again, to the foot of a hillside. This place had no path, and people didn't come often. Hiding them here would be very safe. Then Hu'er chose a good place, lifted a stone, and pressed the copper coins to the bottom! He was afraid he would forget the place, so he stuck a small branch next to the stone.

　　He turned around and ran towards the school. Running to the edge of the village, he stood on an earth embankment and looked over there. There was no one, and he felt relieved!

　　铜元（上）

　　一
    天刚朦朦亮，虎儿他爹就从被窝里爬起来，穿上衣服，下了炕。虎儿他妈也醒了。就是虎儿还合着小眼睛睡着。
    虎儿爹这里那里的找什么东西。找不着，有点发急，扭回头来问虎儿妈：“褡连子（注一）放到那里啦？”
    虎儿妈说：“就在那瓮上哩吆？”说完就开始穿衣服，准备起来。
    “瓮上哪里有？”虎儿爹又开始翻腾了。柜子里、桌底下、瓮后头都找了个遍，就是没有褡连。
    虎儿妈起来也帮着找，无意中把抽屉拉开，看见几头大蒜在那里搁着。他联想到昨天请虎儿他二舅吃饺子的情形了。可把她忙了大半天……突然一个念头飘上她的脑子，她急忙说：“呵！褡连在灶房里。”是的，褡连在灶房里。不是昨天盛了豆角的吗？她给忘啦。
    “那你不早说，叫我找这么半天！”虎儿爹抱怨着走出去了。到了灶房，那个半新旧的褡连果然找到了，一面抖着土，一面不高兴的嘟哝着：“老糊涂！老糊涂！”他已经出了大门，又急忙返回来，说了声“给我留下饭。”只听得大门“咣啷”响了一声便走了。
    又过了一小会儿，虎了起来了。妈妈做饭去了。虎儿从书包里取出书温习功课。温习了两课，他跑到灶房里去帮妈妈拉风箱。
    吃早饭的时候，虽说他们等了一会子，可是爹爹还是没回来。
    事情真凑巧，他们刚撩下碗，他爹就回来了。
    “爹，快吃饭。”虎儿迎上去。爹只哼了一声就进了屋子，把肩上重甸甸鼓吞吞的褡连取下来放到桌子上。
    “爹，这是啥？”虎儿问。
    “铜元。”他爹答。
    “那里的铜元？”虎儿问。
    “给公家（注二）工厂里送的。”他爹答。
    “工厂要这做啥？”
    “造子弹。”
    这一说虎儿明白了：爹是去出勤务，象运输子弹一样这次是运输铜元。实际也就是这么回事。因为这次运送的路线要经过本村，所以他要回来吃早饭。
    虎儿到灶房给爹去盛米汤。
    虎儿爹见虎儿走了，停止吃饭，把褡连解开，抓了一把铜元，看着看着他就高兴了，是多么喜人的铜元呀！自从日本鬼子打来以后，铜元就一天比一天少了，近几年简直就连一个都见不着。这回见着这么多，就在他生平也还是第一次。抗战以前，这么一把就能买几尺布。小时候给人家放羊辛苦一年，也不过赚这么一把两把的。他越看心越爱，可惜就是自己没有……。
    虎儿爹虽说是个老好人，就是爱讨个小便宜。看见这些铜元，不知怎么的心里总痒痒。他想留下一些，可是明明知道这不对，叫上级知道了一定受处罚。他把铜元放进去了……他又把铜元抓起来，他想来想去，想去想来，最后把铜元装进了自己的口袋……。
    虎儿已经进来，看见爹往口袋里装，一下摸不清是怎么回事。就问：“爹，这不是给人家工厂送的吗？”他爹碰他说：“你别管。”
    虎儿更奇怪了，看爹的那个神气，他也没再问，反正觉着不对头。
    吃过饭虎儿爹要抽烟，叫他到灶火里点个火，虎儿去了。
    点回来火，虎儿再看爹的口袋，已经什么也没有了。
    他爹背起褡连要走了，虎儿只是看着他，心里总在想：“他把铜元放到哪里啦？”
    虎儿妈去洗锅碗。
    虎儿楞了楞。
    虎儿开始找起铜元来了：抽屉里、毡底下、柜子里，都没有找到。他象爹早晨找褡连一样，也有点着急。简直对爹有点不满意。
    他又找，又找。
    啊！那不是吗！铜元在门框上整整齐齐的卧着呢。
    他想：为什么爹把公家的铜元留下呢？这铜元是送到工厂去造子弹的，不送给工厂怎么还能造成子弹？没有子弹，怎么来打敌人？
    虎儿把铜元数了数，一共六十二个，他把铜元装进自己的口袋，他决定把它缴给公家。
    虎儿把铜元装好，背上书包去上学。他想把铜元是缴给村长好呢，还是缴给区政府？他想，最好是直接缴给工厂，可是工厂在哪里？他不知道。
    虎儿先得去上学，铜元装到口袋里沉甸甸的真不得劲。再说叫别人看见可不好。假若一时不注意丢了不更糟了吗？
    虎儿转了一个弯，走不了几步就出了村。他四下里看了看，没有人，他很放心。心里说：“对，就藏到这里吧。”他把铜元掏出来放到一堆草丛里。放好，他又四下里看了看，还是没人，可是他还不放心，于是，很快把钱又收起。他想：二旦他们要来割草，一割不就找着了吗？铜元要叫二旦拿走，就别再想要回来啦。他又往前跑，跑到一个山坡跟，这地方没路，人们不多来，藏到这里可十分保险。接着虎儿选好地方，搬起一块石头把铜元压到底下了！他怕自己忘了地方，石头旁边插了一根小树枝。
    他扭回头往学校里跑去。跑到村边他站到一个土堰上往那边看，没有人，他放心了！　　　　　　　　（未完）
