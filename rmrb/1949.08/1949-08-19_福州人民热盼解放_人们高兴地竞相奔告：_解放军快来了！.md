Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 17th. A dispatch from Fuzhou: The people of Fuzhou are longing for liberation. In April of this year, with the liberation of vast areas of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, remnants of the Kuomintang bandit army, fleeing and scurrying from all directions, swarmed into Fuzhou like a swarm of locusts. Ragged bandit soldiers and officers seized civilian houses everywhere, workers were driven out of factories, students were driven out of schools, and merchants were driven out of shops; those who were driven out had no choice but to huddle in the streets and alleys. In late June, the Minjiang River flooded, and areas along the river in the city became a swamp. Many ordinary people were drowned, and the Kuomintang bandit gang authorities provided no relief to the disaster victims at all. The bandit soldiers were also not eating enough, and the streets and alleys were full of their stalls. The pseudo-gold yuan notes have been discontinued, and no one wants to use the pseudo-"silver yuan notes" either. All shops and restaurants are priced in rice, with price tags stating that a box of matches costs two liang of rice, and a box of Red Man brand cigarettes costs one jin of rice. Citizens carry rice bags to shops to exchange for goods. Because the bandit gang has always ignored educational funding, teachers in all large, medium, and small schools in the city are starving, and most students have dropped out of school. Teachers and students struggling on the brink of starvation have organized large demonstrations demanding "public funding" and "opposing the civil war." Some students organized "begging groups" and "meal-seeking teams" to resist the starvation policies imposed on the education sector by the Kuomintang remnant bandit gangs. Slogans saying that the People's Liberation Army has arrived in a certain place are often found on the streets of Fuzhou, and people are happily telling each other: The People's Liberation Army is coming soon, Fuzhou is about to be liberated!

　　福州人民热盼解放
  　人们高兴地竞相奔告：
    解放军快来了！
    【新华社上海十七日电】据福州讯：福州人民渴望着解放。今年四月，随着京、沪、杭广大地区的解放，由各方溃退逃窜的国民党匪军残部，象一窝蝗虫似地窜进了福州。衣服褴褛的匪军官兵到处抢占民房，工人被赶出了工厂，学生被赶出学校，商人被赶出了商店；被赶出的人只好蜷缩在街头巷尾。六月下旬，闽江泛滥，市区沿江一带均成泽国，许多老百姓被淹毙，国民党匪帮当局对灾民根本不予救济。匪军士兵也是吃不饱，街头巷尾尽是他们摆设的地摊。伪金元券已停止了使用，伪“银民券”也无人愿意使用。所有商店、饭馆都以米计价，标价签上写着一盒火柴二两米，一盒红人牌香烟一斤米。市民都手里提着米袋到商店换东西。由于匪帮对教育经费一直采取不理不问态度，全市大中小学的教师都已饿饭，学生大部停学。在饥饿线上挣扎的师生们，曾组织了“要公费”、“反内战”的大游行。有一部分同学则组织了“要饭团”、“讨饭队”，反抗国民党残余匪帮所施于教育界的饥饿政策。福州街头经常发现解放军到了某地的标语，人们都相互高兴地奔告着：解放军快来了，福州快要解放了！
