Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 5th—Public security organs in various parts of Henan have recently cracked several cases of Kuomintang secret agents and bandits using feudal societies to plot riots. On June 26th, the Henan Provincial Public Security Department arrested more than 40 “I-Kuan-Tao” bandit leaders, including Yuan Guofu, near Lüjia Village, outside Kaifeng, thwarting these bandits’ plan to use “Tongtian Dao” to stage a riot and conspire to disrupt Kaifeng City. Bandit Yuan was a local tyrant in the Fengqiu area and had organized riots in Fengqiu, Yanjin, and other places, committing all kinds of evil and harming the people. He ultimately could not escape the long arm of the People’s Government. The Public Security Bureau of the Xuchang Municipal People’s Government also cracked an “I-Kuan-Tao” riot case on June 22nd, arresting more than 30 bandit leaders, including Cai Pengchun and Wang Bangxiu. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Xuchang “I-Kuan-Tao” was led by the big traitor Chen Tianyan, acting as an accomplice to the Japanese invaders. Later, it accepted the command of the Kuomintang bandit leader Tang Enbo and carried out activities in western Henan. After the liberation of Xuchang, the society, headed by the great local tyrant Cai Pengchun, continued to carry out sabotage activities under the command of the "Society Affairs Office" of the Second Bandit Pacification Headquarters. After these cases were cracked, the People's Government immediately announced to the people the fact that these societies were colluding with Kuomintang secret agents and bandits to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, and launched vigorous political propaganda. The deceived members voluntarily registered, handed over their certificates, and broke away from the reactionary societies. In Kaifeng alone, more than 6,000 people broke away from the reactionary "Tongtian Dao." The registered and repentant members also voluntarily accused the chief criminals in the society of various crimes to the People's Government. Note: Since this spring, the activities of reactionary societies in Henan have been extremely rampant, with more than 170 varieties including "I-Kuan-Tao," "Central Bagua Society," "Zhongzhou Confucian Sacred Path," "Temple Dao," "Nine Palaces Dao," "Red Learning," and "Yellow Learning." These societies are all controlled by Kuomintang bandit gang lurking agents, political bandits, or local tyrant landlords. Seeing that their rule in Henan was about to perish, the Kuomintang bandit gang used remnant armed bandits and secret agents in combination with reactionary societies to continuously carry out dying armed rebellions, attempting to disrupt revolutionary order and undermine the construction of the new China. These conscienceless bandits did everything they could, including killing, arson, rape, looting, and spreading rumors to confuse the public.

    国民党匪特勾结封建会门阴谋捣乱
    河南破获暴动案数起
    匪首被捕，被骗会众自动登记，控诉首恶分子无耻罪行。
    【新华社开封五日电】河南各地公安机关最近连续破获国民党特务匪徒利用封建会门阴谋暴动的案件数起。河南省公安厅于六月廿六日在开封附近吕家庄逮捕了“一贯道”匪首袁国福等四十余人，粉碎了这些匪徒利用“通天道”举行暴动、阴谋扰乱开封市的计划。袁匪为封邱一带恶霸，曾先后在封邱、延津等地组织暴动，无恶不作，贻害人民，终究逃脱不了人民政府的法网。许昌市人民政府公安局亦于六月二十二日破获“一贯道”暴动案，逮捕匪首蔡蓬春、王邦修等三十余人。许昌“一贯道”，在抗日战争时期为大汉奸陈天宴所领导，为日寇作伥，后又接受国民党匪首汤恩伯之指挥，在豫西一带进行活动。许昌解放后，该会又以大恶霸蔡蓬春为首在匪第二绥署“会门办事处”指挥下继续进行破坏活动。这些案件破获后，人民政府即向人民宣布这些会门与国民党特务匪徒结合一起进行反革命活动的事实，并展开有力的政治宣传。被骗会众纷纷自动登记，交出证件，脱离反动会门，仅开封一地即有六千余人脱离反动的“通天道”。登记悔过的会众并自动向人民政府控诉会中首恶分子的种种罪行。按：自今春以来，河南反动会门的活动极为猖獗，其名目有“一贯道”、“中央八卦会”、“中州儒门圣道”、“庙道”、“九宫道”、“红学”、“黄学”等一百七十余种之多。这些会门均为国民党匪帮潜伏特务、政治土匪或恶霸地主所操纵。国民党匪帮眼见其在河南的统治已经灭亡，遂以残余武装匪特结合反对会门不断举行垂死的武装蠢动，妄图扰乱革命秩序，破坏新中国的建设事业。这些丧尽人性的匪贼，到处杀人放火，奸淫抢掠，造谣惑众无所不用其极。
