Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 22nd (via TASS): Police terror in Japan is intensifying day by day. According to Tokyo sources, the authorities intend to abolish the Central Committee of the Railway Workers' Union in an attempt to strangle the railway workers' movement. Seventeen leaders of the Central Committee of the Union have already been dismissed under the pretext of layoffs. Among the dismissed workers, there are also 152 union leaders. The Japanese police are simultaneously carrying out mass arrests. The Asahi Shimbun reported that hundreds of railway workers protesting the mass layoffs were imprisoned without investigation or trial. Japanese newspapers reported that ten railway workers arrested on July 26th have announced a hunger strike to protest police terror. In Osaka alone, police arrested 172 people in five days on the charge of "spreading false rumors." The only crime of those arrested was that they dared to condemn the looting and atrocities frequently committed against Japanese women by American soldiers during exercises in Tsuruga. The police are brazenly provoking the workers. On July 28th, the Okayama police attacked a peaceful march held by workers to welcome former Japanese prisoners of war repatriated from the Soviet Union. Many workers were beaten and injured in the conflict. In Mitaka, police arrested seven Communist workers who were allegedly involved in organizing railway incidents. The absurd excuse for the arrests was that these Communists "attended a meeting of their party" on the day the incident occurred. The police are also searching for progressive journalists. On July 29th, the police arrested the editor-in-chief and publisher of the progressive "Truth" newspaper on the grounds that they had published articles in the newspaper exposing the improper activities of members of the ruling "Liberal Democratic" party.

At the same time, the police have resumed the "thought control" system over the Japanese people, which was previously widely implemented by the Japanese militarist group. This measure was initiated by Mr. Eells, a representative of MacArthur's headquarters. He strongly urged the expulsion of all teachers from universities whose thinking does not meet "American democratic standards." Following this "call," the president of Tokyo Imperial University urgently called for measures to control the political activities of university teachers and students at a meeting of university presidents on July 22nd. Teachers in major universities and middle schools who disagree with the restoration of the police "thought control" system are being dismissed one after another.

Despite the police's barbarous and brutal actions, the Japanese working people have launched a more organized counterattack against the offensive of the reactionaries, openly supported by the occupying authorities. On July 19th, a 4,000-strong rally and large-scale workers' demonstration were held in Nagoya. The rally passed a resolution demanding the cessation of layoffs of railway workers. More than 10,000 people participated in a large-scale march of workers and employees in Tokyo on August 6th, demanding the resignation of the reactionary Yoshida government and the cessation of mass layoffs of workers and employees.

The strike movement is spreading throughout Japan. On July 21st, the union of Osaka Iron and Steel Company, which has 12,000 workers, decided to hold a 24-hour strike to protest a 20% wage cut. On July 23rd, 4,500 workers in a factory belonging to the company went on strike. On July 22nd, workers of the Fukui Electric Railway Company also announced a strike.

　　日职工普遍展开罢工运动抗击美日反动派恐怖活动
    【新华社北平廿二日电】塔斯社平壤十六日讯：日本的警察恐怖正日甚一日。据东京方面消息，当局将取消铁路工会中央委员会，以图绞杀铁路职工运动。十七名工会中央委员会领袖已在裁员的借口下被解雇。在被解雇的职工中，尚有一百五十二名工会领袖。日本警察同时实行大批逮捕。朝日新闻载称：抗议大批解雇的数百名铁路员工，未经调查和审讯即被监禁。日本报纸报道七月二十六日被捕的十名铁路职工已宣布举行绝食，以抗议警察的恐怖。在大坂一地，警察在五天内就以“散播错误谣言”的罪名，逮捕了一百七十二人。被捕的唯一罪名，就是他们敢于谴责当美军在敦贺演习期间经常对日本妇女施以抢掠和暴行。警察粗暴地向工人们挑衅，冈山警察在七月二十八日攻击工人们为欢迎自苏联遣送回国的前日军战俘而举行的和平游行，在冲突中许多工人被殴打受伤。在三鹰，警察逮捕了七名据称是组织铁路事件的共产党工人。逮捕的荒诞借口是当事件发生的那一天，这些共产党人“参加他们党的会议”。警察也搜捕进步记者。七月二十九日警察逮捕了进步的“真相”报的主笔和发行人，理由是他们在该报发表文章，揭露当政的“自由民主”党党员的不正当活动。
    同时，警察又恢复对日本人民的“思想控制”制度，这种制度以前曾被日本军国主义集团广泛施行过。这种措施是由麦克阿瑟总部代表雅尔斯发起实施的。他力促逐出各大学中思想上不合乎“美国民主标准”的一切教员。紧接这一“号召”之后，东京帝国大学校长即于七月二十二日在日本各大学校长会议上紧急呼吁，要求采取管制大学教员与学生政治活动的措施。那些不同意恢复警察“思想控制”制度的各大中学校教员，正在先后被解雇中。
    虽然有警察的横蛮和残暴行动，日本的劳动人民已对占领当局公开支持下的反动派的进攻，矛以更有组织的反击。七月十九日，名古屋举行四千人的大会和职工大示威。大会通过决议，要求停止解雇铁路职工。一万余人参加八月六日在东京举行的工人与职员大游行，要求吉田反动政府辞职，停止大批解雇工人和职员。
    日本国内的罢工运动正在普遍展开。七月二十一日，大坂钢铁公司拥有一万二千工人的工会，决定举行二十四小时的罢工，抗议减薪百分之二十。七月二十三日，该公司所属一个工厂的四千五百工人已举行罢工。七月二十二日，福井电气铁路公司工人也宣布罢工。
