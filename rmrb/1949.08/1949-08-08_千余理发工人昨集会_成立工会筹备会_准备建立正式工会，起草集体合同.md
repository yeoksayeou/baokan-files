    Over a Thousand Barbers Gathered Yesterday
    to Form a Trade Union Preparatory Committee
    Preparing to Establish a Formal Trade Union, Drafting a Collective Contract
    [This Municipality News] The barbers of Ping Municipality have established a trade union preparatory committee. Over a thousand workers in the industry gathered yesterday (the 7th) at the Democratic Theater, electing 21 preparatory committee members, including male worker Yang Deqi and female worker Sun Yumei, to begin establishing a formal trade union organization and drafting a collective contract.
    Comrades Zhang Chunjiu and Wan Yi of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions spoke at the meeting. In addition to first explaining the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, workers uniting with capitalists to develop production and prosper the economy, they particularly addressed some current ideological biases among workers in the industry, emphasizing the need to eliminate feudal guild ideology and that organizing trade unions and recruiting members should be completely voluntary and not compulsory. Those who join the trade union will have their due wages and benefits guaranteed by the trade union. At the same time, once they join the trade union, they must understand that the minority should submit to the majority, and the individual should submit to the group.

    千余理发工人昨集会
    成立工会筹备会
    准备建立正式工会，起草集体合同
    【本市讯】平市理发业工人成立了工会筹备会。该业千余工人昨（七日）在民主剧场集会，选出男工杨德启、女工孙玉梅等二十一人为筹备委员，着手建立正式工会组织和起草集体合同。
    市总工会张春久、万一两同志在会上讲话，除首先说明劳资两利政策，工人团结资本家发展生产繁荣经济外，特别针对该业部分工人当前的一些思想偏向着重指出要肃清封建行会主义思想，组织工会吸收会员要完全出于自觉自愿，不要强制。参加工会的，工会对其应得工资，应有福利予以保障。同时既参加工会后，就要了解少数应该服从多数，个人服从团体。
