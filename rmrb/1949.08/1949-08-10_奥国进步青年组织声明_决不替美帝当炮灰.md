Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th: Vienna dispatch: The progressive youth organization "Free Austrian Youth" issued the following statement on the 7th regarding the arrival of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force Chiefs of Staff in Austria: In April of this year, U.S. Congressman Cannon stated that in future wars, the United States would only need to supply weapons, while Western European countries would have to send their youth to the battlefield. In June of this year, Austrian Chancellor Figl expressed the hope that the Austrian army could be established quickly. Now, people from the U.S. General Staff are visiting Western European countries—including Austria. Undoubtedly, these three facts are closely related. However, we want to tell the American generals: "Mr. Cannon's calculation is wrong. Austrian youth are unwilling to fight and sacrifice for the interests of foreign countries, and are unwilling to realize the wishes of the American generals. Austrian youth want peace." The Austrian Communist Party's newspaper "People's Opinion" quoted a report from the New York Times stating that the military aid bill for Western Europe stipulates that the U.S. government has the right to pay for "urgent unexpected expenses in future aid to Austria." "People's Opinion" pointed out: "Thus, Truman's military aid bill will undoubtedly be linked to the visit of the U.S. Chiefs of Staff to Austria. The New York Times report reveals the intention of the United States to militarize Austria and turn Austria into an outpost of the Western European alliance. Very clearly linked to this plan is the establishment of an Austrian army, which the Austrian government is now implementing at the behest of the United States. The New York Times report shows what this army, which is only nominally Austrian, will be used for."

    奥国进步青年组织声明
    决不替美帝当炮灰
    【新华社北平九日电】维也纳讯：进步的青年组织“自由奥地利青年”于七日就美国陆海空军参谋长抵达奥国事发表声明如下：今年四月，美国议员康农声称，在将来的战争中，美国只须供给武器，而西欧国家则必须把他们的青年送上战场。在今年六月，奥国总理费格尔曾表示希望奥国军队能迅即建立。现在，美国参谋总部的人们正访问西欧国家——包括奥国在内。毫无疑问地，这三件事实是紧密地相互连系着的。但是，我们要正告美国的将军们：“康农先生的算盘打错了。奥国青年不愿为了外国的利益而战争和牺牲，不愿实现美国将军们的愿望。奥国青年要和平。”奥共机关报“人民舆论报”引纽约时报的报道称：对西欧的军事援助法案规定，美国政府有权支付“在将来援助奥国”中有急迫需要的意外支出。“人民舆论报”指出：“如此，则杜鲁门的军事援助法案，将无疑地与美国参谋长的访奥连结在一起。纽约时报的报道透露了美国军事化奥国并变奥国为西欧联盟之前哨的意图。与这种计划非常明显地结合在一起的，就是建立奥国的军队，而奥国政府现正按美国的命令在执行这个计划。纽约时报的报道显示了这支仅仅在名义上是奥国的军队将用于什么目的。”
