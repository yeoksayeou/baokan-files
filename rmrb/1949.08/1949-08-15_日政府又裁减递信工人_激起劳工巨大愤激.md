    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th: Tokyo dispatch: Following the mass layoffs of national railway workers in July, the Yoshida government has now begun to cut postal workers. The Japanese Ministry of Postal Services and the Ministry of Telecommunications received an order on the 11th to cut 11,500 workers. As with the layoffs of railway workers, the Yoshida government is plotting to use the layoff plan to strike at progressive labor unions. According to a Reuters report, 32 of the 40 members of the Central Struggle Committee of the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union received layoff notices on the 12th, the vast majority of whom are communists. This action by the Yoshida government has aroused great indignation among Japanese laborers.

    日政府又裁减递信工人
    激起劳工巨大愤激
    【新华社北平十四日电】东京消息：吉田政府在七月大批裁减国营铁道工人之后，现又开始裁减递信工人。日本邮务省及电讯省已于十一日奉到裁减工人一万一千五百名的命令。如同在裁减铁道工人时一样，吉田政府阴谋藉裁员计划打击进步工会。据路透社消息，全日递信工人工会中央斗争委员会四十名委员中，已有三十二名于十二日接到被裁的通知，其中绝大多数是共产党员。吉田政府这种行为，激起了日本劳工的巨大愤激。
