    [Thirteenth District News] After our dozen or so district cadres arrived at the key village of Pingfang, we all lived together in the Catholic Church. We brought a cook comrade and ate and slept together in a concentrated way. At noon and in the evening, we dispersed into the village to work. But after ten days of work, we had not mobilized the masses and had little contact with them. Some people felt it was difficult and their work enthusiasm was not high. After discussion, we decided to persevere in going among the masses. The village has a total of 496 households in fourteen neighborhoods, so we divided into four groups and dispersed to live in each neighborhood. We sent the cook back to the district and went to each neighborhood for meals, changing families every day or two. In this way, we talked directly with the masses about land reform policies, and the masses were happy to connect with us, pouring out all the exploitation and oppression they had suffered from the landlords since birth.

    "Land reform is a good thing! I till the landlord's land, and even the landlord's four- or five-year-old child calls me, a man in my sixties, by my nickname!" Old peasant Wang Deming told us with great grievance.

    Zhao Chenghai's wife said to us: "When we cultivate the landlord's land, we have to pay the landlord five *laodou* (112.5 *jin* of corn) per *mu*, and also 20 bundles of reeds. No matter how good or bad the year is, we have to pay it, not a bit less. We can only keep a little firewood for ourselves." We said, "You can plant some wheat after autumn!" "Plant wheat! The landlord gets a share of that too!" she said resentfully. Zhang Zhen's widowed old lady complained to us: "My mother starved to death. If land reform had come in those years, she could have turned over! Back then, my man worked as a long-term laborer and did petty trading all year round, but we still couldn't get enough to eat."

    As a result of going deep among the masses, the district cadres gradually understood the mood of the masses, and their work enthusiasm was very high. They said with satisfaction: "This is much better than the past ten days. The masses are very kind to us. In the past few days, I thought the masses here were not as good as the masses in the old areas, but now it has been confirmed that the class hatred of the masses is the same."

    十三区参加土改干部
    改变工作方式  开始深入群众
    【十三区讯】我们十几个区干部到了平房重点村后，就集体住在天主堂。带着炊事员同志，集中吃饭和睡觉。中午和晚上分散到村中去工作。可是经过了十天的工作，并没有把群众发动起来，接近群众也很少。有的人感觉困难，工作情绪也不高，我们研讨后，决定要坚持到群众中去。这村一共四百九十六户，十四个闾，于是我们就划分了四个小组，分散住到各闾去。把炊事员调回区里，我们就到各闾去派饭吃，一、两天换一家。这样，我们直接和群众谈起土改政策，群众和我们接上头，也很高兴，他们把自己从降生以来所受地主的剥削和压迫一齐倾吐出来。
    “倒是土改好哇！我种地主的地，连地主四、五岁的小孩，也把我这六十多岁的人叫小名哪！”贫农成份的老汉王德明，向我们很委屈的这样说。
    赵成海的老婆向我们说：“我们种地主的地，一亩地要给地主交五老斗（一百一十二斤半玉米），还要交廿棒节（茅柴）。不管年头好坏，也得给他交，差一点都不行。自己就落点柴火。”我们说：“你每年秋后可以种点麦子呀！”“种麦子！地主也得分啊！”她愤恨的这样说。张振家的寡妇老太太，向我们诉苦说：“我妈就是饿死的。如果赶上这年头土地改革，也可以翻翻身呀！那时候，我当家的整年做长活，做小买卖，也吃不饱。”
    深入到群众中去的结果，区干部逐步地了解了群众情绪，工作情绪都很高涨，满意地说：“这比过去那十几天可强得多了。群众对我们都很亲热。过去那几天，我看这里的群众不如老区的群众，现在证实了：群众的阶级仇恨都是一样的”。
