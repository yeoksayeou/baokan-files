    Lenin and the Birth of Soviet Literature
    by Ivanov
    Translated by Hua Ming

    Lenin, the great founder of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state, attached great importance to literature, viewing it as an extremely important tool for mass education.

    Long before the Great October Socialist Revolution, Lenin had meticulously studied the fundamental questions of culture and aesthetics, and formulated the main principles in the fields of art and literature.

    In this regard, Lenin's article, "Party Organization and Party Literature," is of great importance. In this article, he put forward the fundamental principles of the Bolshevik policy on literature. This article was written during the climax of the 1905 Revolution, which alone is enough to clearly illustrate how much Lenin valued the role of literature in the revolutionary movement.

    This article, serving as a program for the Party's activities among writers and artists, still retains its great significance today.

    The basic principle put forward in this article is the principle of Party spirit in literature, in other words, that literature must be integrated with the interests of the working class and all working people. This is the meaning of Lenin's statement that "literary work must become a part of the overall cause of the proletarian movement..."

    In the initial years after the October Socialist Revolution, the main task of the young Soviet Republic, as everyone remembers, was to defeat the White armies and interventionists. Although war was going on at that time, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, were already carrying out extensive work in economic organization and cultural development.

    Lenin wrote in 1919: "In the early days after the proletarian revolution, it was natural and inevitable that we had to devote more effort to overcoming the resistance of the bourgeoisie, conquering the exploiters, and crushing their conspiracies, which were the main and fundamental tasks. But at the same time, another task emerged with the same inevitability and became more urgent with the passage of time, namely, the more essential task of positive, communist construction…"

    In this positive, communist construction, Lenin attached great importance to cultural construction, and literature was an integral part of cultural construction.

    In depicting the process of this new socialist cultural construction, clear and definite principles must be put forward regarding the issue of the cultural heritage of the past.

    Various so-called "iconoclasts" who vehemently rejected the cultural heritage were making more noise than ever shortly after the revolution. They were the kind of people who, while actually being unrevolutionary or even hostile to the revolution, pretended to be revolutionary heroes.

    Before the October Revolution, Lenin had resolutely combatted all attempts to reject the old culture, especially the legacy left by the revolutionary democrats. A tenacious debate had taken place regarding the cultural heritage of the period of reaction that followed the failure of the 1905 Revolution.

    Among the enemies of Bolshevism in that period, the most dangerous were the Machists, because they were all trying to dress themselves up as Marxists. Bogdanov (the theorist of Machism) and his followers rejected all old culture. Bogdanov's "theory" was that proletarian culture must be started from scratch, and the value of all old culture must be regarded as completely irrelevant to the proletariat and discarded.

    In "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" (1909), Lenin delivered a crushing blow to Machian philosophy, which served as the theoretical basis for Bogdanov and his followers.

    Lenin put forward his truly scientific theory on the path to developing socialist culture. He put forward the thesis that the legacy of the past must be regarded as the starting point for further cultural development.

    In a conversation with Zetkin, Lenin said, "Why should we turn a blind eye to those things that are truly beautiful and refuse to regard them as the starting point for further cultural development, simply because they are 'old'?"

    However, when dealing with the issue of the cultural heritage of the past from this point of view, Lenin said that every nation has two cultures: one is the culture of the ruling class, and the other is the culture of the democratic strata, which, in the Russian nation, is the culture made famous by the names of Chernyshevsky and Plekhanov. Lenin emphasized that the proletariat is the defender of the revolutionary democratic heritage.

    Zhdanov said in 1946: "In the field of literature, our Party, through Lenin and Stalin, has repeatedly recognized the great significance of the great Russian revolutionary democratic writers and critics Belinsky, Dobrolyubov, Chernyshevsky, Saltykov-Shchedrin, and Plekhanov."

    There is no room for doubt about Lenin's views on cultural issues. He believed that the greatest value of the culture of the past was created by the representatives of democratic culture. Lenin said that the works of the best artists of aristocratic and bourgeois origin have "broad world significance" precisely because those works, by faithfully depicting reality, contributed to the liberation struggle of the masses.

    However, Lenin insisted on critically absorbing the cultural heritage of the past, and opposed blindly and far-fetchedly accepting it.

    A typical example of Lenin's attitude towards the culture of the past is his articles on Tolstoy, in which he discussed not only the strengths of this great writer's works, but also their weaknesses. He pointed out that Tolstoy, seen as a brilliant artist and a ruthless critic of the social state of the landed gentry, marked a step forward in the development of human art; on the other hand, Lenin emphasized that, in terms of ideological principles, Tolstoy's philosophical doctrines were very harmful to the working class's struggle for socialism. The proletariat loved and cherished Tolstoy's powerful and courageous realism, and his protests against the injustice and hypocrisy of the exploitative system, but rejected his harmful, reactionary, and utopian philosophy.

    Lenin gave the same profound evaluation to other classical works of Russian literature.

    Lenin thus raised the issue of inheriting the best traditions of the old culture, considering it not as passive inheritance, but as creative inheritance, and raised the issue of developing this tradition on a newer foundation, in accordance with the interests of the proletariat. Lenin saw the great significance of October Revolution for culture precisely in the fact that it did not destroy the value of culture, as those intellectuals who hated the revolution said, but saved culture from the destruction to which it was destined by capitalism. Lenin further saw in this fact the significance of the October Revolution in terms of culture, that is, the October Revolution "turned all the marvels of technology, all the achievements of culture, over to the entire people."

    Lenin tirelessly advocated mastering these achievements. He wrote in the article "The Successes and Difficulties of Soviet Power": "All the culture that capitalism has left us must be taken over, and socialism must be built from here. All science, engineering, all knowledge and art, must be taken over."

    The most excellent culture that human society has ever produced must be studied and critically mastered. On this point, Lenin discussed it in particular detail in his famous speech at the Second All-Russian Congress of Communist Youth Leagues on October 2, 1920. This historically significant speech played a major role in the development of Soviet culture. This speech cultivated generations of builders of socialist countries. In this speech, Lenin very emphatically said that socialist culture can only be developed on the basis of the culture of the past.

    Lenin said: "Unless we clearly understand that it is only by relying on accurate knowledge of the culture created by the entire development of mankind, only by transforming this culture, that it is possible to build a proletarian culture, unless we understand this, we cannot solve this problem. Proletarian culture is not something that no one knows where it comes from, not something invented by those who call themselves experts in proletarian culture. That is complete nonsense. Proletarian culture must be the result of the natural development of knowledge accumulation, which has been accumulated by mankind under the oppression of capitalist society, feudal society, and bureaucratic society."

    To implement Lenin's instructions, a lot of work has been done, such as collecting and preserving everything valuable in the old cultural heritage, everything that can promote the progress and development of the culture of the working people. This includes the decision on establishing monuments for famous figures in philosophy, literature, science, and art, which was suggested by Lenin and adopted by the government, the decision on publishing famous Russian works, the decision on preserving books and caring for scientists, and many other measures taken in the early years of the Soviet state's existence.

    As early as 1897, Lenin said in his article "What Kind of Heritage Do We Reject," "Preserving a heritage does not mean limiting oneself to that heritage." After the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, it is even more impermissible to limit oneself to mastering the old cultural heritage. Lenin regarded this heritage as the starting point for creating socialist culture. He believed that the main task was to develop a new culture, a new art and literature, on a new basis, in accordance with the interests of the proletariat. In those early days of the revolution, Lenin put forward "the task of building a new culture, when the proletariat forms its own life, to distinguish it from the old culture in which it did not participate." To establish a new socialist culture, the first thing encountered was an extremely difficult task, because there was a lack of trained and educated people. Lenin pointed out that "socialist construction is impossible without a large number of experts trained in science…" But the actual situation at that time was that a team of proletarian experts like this did not exist. It would take many years to train them. That is why in the spring of 1918, Lenin put forward the issue of utilizing old bourgeois experts in the article "The Current Tasks of the Soviet Government."

    Then in 1919, Lenin wrote again: "In reality, the current task is to win over those who were educated by capitalism to oppose us to serve us."

    It is clear that this issue mainly concerned intellectuals, who ideologically supported the revolution and accepted the revolution in one way or another.

    列宁与苏维埃文学的产生
    伊凡诺夫著
    华明译
    列宁，布尔塞维克党与苏维埃国家之伟大的建立者，对于文学赋予以极其重大的意义，视之为群众教育的一种极其重要的工具。
    远在伟大的十月社会主义革命以前，列宁即曾精心研究过文化与美学的基本问题，并制订了艺术与文学领域中的主要原则。
    在这方面，列宁的一篇文章，“党的组织与党的文学”，是非常重要的。他在这篇文章中提出了关于文学的布尔塞维克政策之根本原则。这篇文章是在一九○五年革命高潮时写的，即此一端已足清楚说明列宁对于文学在革命运动中的作用是如何重视的了。
    这篇文章，供作党在文艺作家中活动的纲领，即在今日，仍保有其重大意义。
    在这篇文章中所提出的基本原则，即文学之党性的原则，换言之，即文学与工人阶级及一切劳动人民的利益必须互相结合起来。此即列宁所说“文学事业必须成为整个无产阶级运动事业的一部分……”的意旨所在。
    在十月社会主义革命以后的最初几年中，年青的苏维埃共和国的主要任务，如大家所记得的，是打败白党与干涉主义者。当时虽然战争在进行着。而在共产党领导下的苏维埃人民，在那时候即已在经济组织与文化发展方面进行着广泛的工作了。
    列宁在一九一九年写道：“在无产阶级革命后的初期，我们必须更多地从事于战胜资产阶级的抵抗，征服剥削者，粉碎他们的阴谋这一类主要的与根本的任务，乃是自然而且必然的。但与此任务同时，另一任务也以同样的必然性且随时间之进展而更迫切地呈现到表面来了，那就是积极的、共产主义的建设之更本质的任务。…………”
    在这一积极的、共产主义的建设中，列宁对于文化建设赋予以重大作用，而文学乃是文化建设的一个组成部分。
    在描绘这个新的社会主义文化建设的进程时，关于过去文化遗产的问题，必须提出清楚明确的原则来。
    极力排斥文化遗产的各种各样所谓“反对偶像崇拜者”，刚在革命之后不久，比从来都喧嚷得更厉害，他们是这样一种人，虽然实实在在是不革命甚至是敌视革命的，却装得象革命元勋的样子。
    在十月革命前，列宁即已坚决打击了那些排斥旧文化尤其是为革命民主派所留下的遗产的一切企图。关于在一九○五年革命失败后随之而来的反动时期的文化遗产的争论，曾进行过一次顽强的论战。
    在那时期的布尔塞维主义的敌人中，特别危险的是马赫派，因为他们都是企图穿着马克思主义者的外衣的。巴格达诺夫（马赫派的理论家）及其信徒们排斥一切旧的文化。巴格达诺夫的“理论”是：无产阶级的文化，必须从头作起，一切旧文化的价值，必须视为与无产阶级毫不相干的东西而把他们扔掉。
    列宁在“唯物论与经验批判论”（一九○九年）中，对于作为巴格达诺夫及其信徒们之理论根据的马赫哲学，给予了一个粉碎性的打击。
    列宁提出了他的关于发展社会主义文化的道路之真正科学的理论。他提出了一个论纲，即：必须把过去的遗产视为更进一步发展文化的出发点。
    在同蔡特金的一次谈话中，列宁说“为什么我们一定要对于那些真正是美丽的东西掉头不顾，拒绝把它视为更进一步发展文化的出发点，仅仅因为它是‘旧的’原故呢？”
    可是，在从这种观点处理过去文化遗产问题时，列宁说，每个民族都有两种文化：一种是统治阶级的文化，一种是民主阶层的文化，这种文化，在俄罗斯民族来说，就是由车尔尼雪夫斯基与蒲烈哈诺夫的名字而著称的文化。列宁强调指出无产阶级是革命民主主义遗产的卫护者。
    日丹诺夫在一九四六年时说：“在文学领域中，我们党，经过列宁与斯大林之口，曾反复承认白林斯基、杜勃洛柳保夫、车尔尼雪夫斯基、萨尔梯考夫——谢德林与蒲烈哈诺夫这些伟大俄罗斯革命民主主义作家与批评家的重大意义。”
    列宁关于文化问题的意见没有丝毫可以置疑的，他认为过去文化之最伟大的价值，是由民主主义文化的代表人物所创造的。列宁说，贵族与资产阶级出身的最优秀的艺术家的作品之具有“广泛的世界意义”，正是因为那些作品，由于忠实地描写了现实，而有助于群众的解放斗争。
    可是，列宁坚持要批判地吸收过去的文化遗产，而反对盲目地、穿凿附会地接受之。
    列宁对于过去文化的态度的典型例子是他的论托尔斯泰的文章，他在那些文章中，不仅讨论了这个伟大作家作品的强点，也讨论了其弱点。他指出：托尔斯泰，当作一个光辉的艺术家与对地主贵族的社会国家之无情的批评家看，标志着在人类艺术发展中向前进了一步；另一方面，列宁又强调指出，从思想原则上说，托尔斯泰的哲学学说，对于工人阶级之为社会主义而斗争，又是很有害的。无产阶级喜爱并珍视托尔斯泰之有力的、勇敢的现实主义，及其对剥削制度的非正义性与虚伪性之表示抗议，但又拒绝其有害的、反动的、空想的哲学。
    列宁对于俄国文学之其他古典著作，也给予了同样深刻的评价。
    列宁这样提出了继承旧文化之最优秀的传统的问题，认为不是消极的继承，而是创造的继承，提出了要按照无产阶级利益在一种新的基础上去发展这种传统的问题。列宁恰恰是在这样的事实中看到了十月革命对于文化的伟大意义，即：十月革命，不是如那些仇视革命的知识分子所说的破坏了文化的价值，而是从那为资本主义所注定了的破坏中拯救了文化。列宁在这一事实中还更进一步看出了十月革命之关于文化的意义，即十月革命“把一切技艺的奇巧，一切文化的成就，归为全体人民所有”。
    列宁不倦地主张要掌握这些成就。他在“苏维埃政权的成功与困难”一文中曾这样写道：“资本主义所留给我们的一切文化，都必须拿过来，社会主义就是要从这里建设起来。一切科学、工程，一切知识和艺术，都必须拿过来。”
    必须研究并批判地掌握人类社会所曾产生的最优秀的文化。关于这一点，列宁在其一九二○年十月二日俄国共产主义青年团第二次大会上的著名的演讲中，讨论得特别详细。这一具有历史意义的演讲，在发展苏维埃文化上，曾经起了重大作用。这篇演讲培养了几代的社会主义国家的建设者，在这篇演讲中，列宁非常强调地说，社会主义文化只能在过去文化的基础上发展起来。
    列宁说：“除非我们清楚地了解，只有依靠由整个人类发展所创造的文化的确切知识，只有依靠把这种文化加以改造，才有可能建设起无产阶级的文化，除非懂得这一点，我们便不能解决这个问题。无产阶级文化不是一种没有人知道它自何而来的东西，不是一种为那些自命为无产阶级文化专家的人们所发明的东西。那完全是一种胡说。无产阶级文化必须是知识积累自然发展的结果，这些知识是由人类在资本主义社会，封建社会，官僚社会的压迫下所日积月累起来的。”
    要贯彻列宁的这些指示，曾经作了很多工作，例如收集和保存旧文化遗产中一切有价值的东西，一切能够促进劳动人民文化的进步与发展的东西。这包括由列宁建议而为政府所通过的关于为哲学、文学、科学和艺术的名人建立纪念碑的决定，关于出版俄国名著的决定，关于保存图书及对科学家关心的决定，以及苏维埃国家存在的最初几年中所采取的许许多多其他办法。
    远在一八九七年，列宁在其“我们拒绝什么样的遗产”一文中说，“保存一种遗产，决不是说要把自己限制在那种遗产上”。在无产阶级专政建立起来之后，把自己限制在精通旧文化遗产上，更是不容许的。列宁是把这种遗产看作创造社会主义文化的出发点，他认为：主要的任务，是在新的基础上，按照无产阶级利益，去发展一种新的文化，一种新的艺术与文学。在革命的最初那些日子，列宁即提出了“要建设一种新文化的任务，当无产阶级形成其自己的生活的时候，以区别于它所没有参与过的旧文化。”  要建立一种新的社会主义的文化，首先即碰着一个极其困难的任务，因为缺乏有训练有教养的人民。列宁指出，“没有大量的经过科学训练的专家，……社会主义建设是不可能的。”可是当时的实际情况是，象这样的无产阶级专家的队伍是不存在的。需要多少年去训练。那就是为什么在一九一八年春，列宁在“苏维埃政府的当前任务”一文中提出利用旧的资产阶级专家的问题。
    随后在一九一九年列宁又写道：“实际上现在的任务就是要把那些为资本主义所教育出来用以反对我们的人们争取过来为我们服务。”
    很清楚地，这个问题主要是关系着知识界的人们，他们在思想上拥护革命，这样或那样地接受革命。
