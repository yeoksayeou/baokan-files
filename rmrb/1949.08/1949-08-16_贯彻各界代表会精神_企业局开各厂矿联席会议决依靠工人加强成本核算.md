　　Implementing the Spirit of the People's Representative Conference
  　Enterprise Bureau Holds Joint Meeting of Factories and Mines, Deciding to Rely on Workers to Strengthen Cost Accounting
    [This City News] The Enterprise Bureau of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, on the day after the closing of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference (August 15th) in the morning, convened a joint meeting of administrative and trade union cadres from its 20 affiliated factories and mines, as well as representatives attending the Representative Conference from various factories and mines, to convey the spirit of the Representative Conference's resolution on developing production and streamlining and economizing. At the meeting, Bureau Chief Mou Zexian pointed out that the main problems currently facing state-owned enterprises in Beijing are: (1) Production does not yet meet the specifications needed by the people; (2) The cost of finished products is still high; (3) Production is not yet fully adapted to the needs of the market. To solve these problems, it is necessary to strengthen the cost accounting system. The entire production process, from raw materials to finished products, must be calculated bit by bit. Workers are very clear about these things, so we must follow the mass line to solve the problems. He called on all factories and mines, in order to implement the spirit of the People's Representative Conference, to formulate plans based on the resolutions of this Representative Conference and their own situation, and implement them step by step. Immediately, a heated discussion was launched on how to arrange work, how to follow the mass line, and the democratization of factory management. Finally, it was decided that each unit should prepare materials on issues such as the leadership of the Enterprise Bureau, the unity of new and old staff, the unity of the Party, government, and trade union within the factory, and the relationship between leaders and employees, in order to convene another meeting soon to discuss and resolve the above issues and implement the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference.

  　企业局开各厂矿联席会议决依靠工人加强成本核算
    【本市讯】北平市人民政府企业局，在平市各界代表会议闭幕的第二天（十五日）上午，召集所属二十单位的厂矿行政、工会干部和出席代表会议的各厂矿代表，举行联席会，传达代表会议关于发展生产与精简节约决议案的精神。会上，牟泽衔局长指出，目前平市公营企业主要问题是：（一）生产还不合人民需要的规格；（二）成品的成本还高；（三）生产还不完全适合市场的需要。要解决这些问题，必须加强成本核算制度。从原料到成品的整个生产过程，要一点一滴的计算，这些事情，工人是非常清楚的，所以应走群众路线，才能解决问题。他号召各厂矿为了贯彻各界代表会议的精神，要根据此次代表会的决议和本身情况，拟定计划，逐步实施。旋即对如何布置工作、如何走群众路线和工厂管理民主化诸问题，展开热烈讨论。最后决定各单位对于企业局的领导、新旧职员的团结、厂内党政工的团结、领导上与职工的关系等问题，准备材料，以便最近再召开会议，就上述问题，进行讨论与解决，来实行各界代表会的决议。
