　　[Baoding Telegram] Under the leadership of the Linqing Town State-Owned Trading Company, public and private factories and stores are working together to leverage economic strength and facilitate urban-rural trade. In the first half of the year, the No. 1 Branch of the State-Owned Trading Company and the Coal and Iron Company established exchange relationships for industrial and agricultural products with more than ten counties, including Yongzhi and Linqing Production Promotion Cooperatives. From April to June, they absorbed 1.42 million jin of cotton wadding, 300,000 jin of grain, 4 million square feet of homespun cloth, and 250,000 jin of scrap copper from rural areas. They supplied rural areas with 6.5 million jin of sea salt, 32,233 jin of kerosene, and 2,396,561 jin of coal. To support agricultural production, in June and July, they supplied 4,556,102 jin of vegetable cakes and bean cakes, and more than 220,000 jin of night soil to the vast rural areas of twelve counties, including Qinghe and Xiajin. In addition, five public-private joint venture iron factories, including Xieli and private Yihua and Xixing, and sixty-three iron smelting businesses supplied rural areas with 25 waterwheels, more than 36,300 pieces of farm tools such as iron shovels, hoes, and plowshares, 170 cotton gins and pressing bows, and 14,982 large and small iron pots. To facilitate transactions for farmers and reduce exploitation by unscrupulous merchants, the public-owned Agricultural and Industrial Oil Workshop transported 120,000 jin of bean cakes to Weixian, selling them directly to farmers at 50 yuan per 100 jin lower than the market price. To make it easier for farmers to purchase, the Agricultural and Forestry Oil Workshop conducted barter transactions, exchanging beans for bean cakes. During the period when the Trading Company purchased large quantities of fertilizer in rural areas, it also appropriately controlled urban and rural prices, making it beneficial for farmers to enter the city for transactions. This promoted the connection between rural areas and cities. At the same time, the mutual relationship between workers and peasants has become increasingly close. The Agricultural and Forestry and Agricultural and Industrial Oil Workshops expanded their operations to support farmers' fertilizer application during the rainy season. All workers proposed to increase production to ensure the fertilizer needs of agricultural production, increasing from seven stacks to nine stacks per worker per day, and maintaining a certain quality of finished products. The workers who dried night soil not only didn't take any night soil from the bottom (because the bottom had inferior soil) for the farmers who came to the city to buy night soil, but also helped load the carts and warmly provided boiled water. The farmers who went to the city to exchange goods all felt that the city under the leadership of the Communist Party was greatly different from the past.

　　国营贸易公司领导下
  　临清公私工厂商店协力开展城乡贸易
    【保定电】临清镇国营贸易公司协同公私营工厂、商店统一发挥经济力量，沟通城乡贸易。国营贸易第一分公司、煤铁公司上半年与永智、临清等十余县生产推进社建立了工农产品的交换关系。四至六月吸收农村棉绒一百四十二万斤，食粮三十万斤，土布四百万方尺，碎铜二十五万斤；输入农村海盐六百五十万斤，煤油三万二千二百三十三斤，煤二百三十九万六千五百六十一斤。为支持农业生产，六、七两月供给清河、夏津等十二个县广大农村菜饼、豆饼四百五十五万六千一百零二斤，大粪二十二万余斤。另外国营协力、私营益华、协兴等五户铁工厂及六十三户铁炉业，供给农村水车二十五架，铁锨、锄头、犁铧等农具三万六千三百多件，轧花车、弹压弓一百七十张，大小铁锅一万四千九百八十二个。为便利农民成交减少奸商剥削，公营农工油坊运往威县豆饼十二万斤，每百斤低于市价五十元，直接销售给农民。为使农民购买方便，农林油坊用豆换豆饼方式进行实物交易。贸易公司在农村大批收购肥料期间，并适当掌握了城乡物价，使农民有利于入城成交。这样便促进了农村与城市的联系。同时工人与农民间互相关系也日渐密切起来。农林、农工油坊，为支持农民雨季施肥，特扩大经营。全体工人提出为保证农业生产肥料需要而加工增产，每个工人由日打七垛增加到九垛，制出成品也保持了一定质量。对乡下到城里买粪的农民，晒粪工人不但不起粪底（因底上有土质次），而且还帮助装车，热情地烧水招待。到城里去交换货物的农民们都一致感觉到共产党领导下的城市里，比之过去是大大变样了。
