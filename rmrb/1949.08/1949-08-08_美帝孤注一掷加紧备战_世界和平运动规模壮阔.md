    U.S. Imperialism Gambles on Intensified War Preparations
    World Peace Movement Expands Magnificently
    The economic situation in the United States continues to deteriorate. A recent report on the world economic situation published by the United Nations Secretariat pointed out that the decline in industrial production in the United States is accelerating. The greatly reduced figures released by the US official Census Bureau also admit that the number of unemployed in the United States increased by 317,000 in July compared to June, and a sharp increase of 1,878,000 compared to July last year. All the facts prove that the initial stage of the US economic crisis—the stage of gradual decline in production—began in December last year. In the past seven months, US industrial production has experienced a comprehensive and straight-line decline. The peak of the post-war prosperity in the United States was in the autumn of last year. In October and November last year, the US industrial production index reached 195 (with the average from 1935 to 1939 as 100). December became the turning point for the US post-war economy. The US industrial production index after December is as follows: December – 190, January this year – 187, February – 185, March – 181, April – 179, May – 174, June – 169. The industrial production index in June this year decreased by 26 points, or 13 percent, compared to October last year.
    In order to get rid of the economic crisis, US imperialism has adopted and continues to adopt a desperate policy of actively preparing for war, although this is the dead end that Hitler has already taken. After the US reactionaries and their lackeys signed the North Atlantic Treaty in April this year, they are now actively carrying out various activities to implement the North Atlantic Treaty. Under the active instigation of the US reactionaries, and with the reactionaries in the majority, the parliaments of all signatory countries except the Netherlands have now ratified this North Atlantic Treaty, which serves as a major tool for preparing for war. Only the Dutch Senate has not yet ratified it. Simultaneously with Truman's proposal to Congress for the so-called "Military Aid Program," which supplements the North Atlantic Treaty, the US Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were also dispatched to Europe on July 30 to discuss with the Western European reactionaries the establishment of the military organization stipulated in the North Atlantic Treaty and to force Western European countries to succumb to the US strategic plan, making these countries the sacrifices of the US adventurous policy. When US Secretary of Defense Johnson and Army Chief of Staff Bradley testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on July 29 for the "Military Aid Program," they blatantly clamored for war and openly outlined the "plan for the North Atlantic Military Alliance." These blatant adventurous measures taken by the US government have aroused widespread vigilance and resistance among the European people. The French Communist Party has called for large-scale demonstrations to protest the arrival of the US Chiefs of Staff in France. A sense of anxiety is even reflected in the British conservative newspapers. The London Times said that there is "a hesitant mood on both sides of the Atlantic, which is expressed as: 'a grave matter'," criticizing the purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty and questioning the value and necessity of this treaty. The Sunday Express expressed alarm at the actions of the US Chiefs of Staff. It said that for Britain and British men and women, the result of realizing the US war plan will be "horrifying, if not disastrous."
    Simultaneous with the imperialist intensification of war preparations, people all over the world are launching a movement to defend peace on an even grander scale. The Second World Youth Congress and Youth Festival is about to open. This grand gathering, which unites the youth of the world to fight for peace and democracy, has been warmly supported by democratic youth from 70 countries. Youth peace teams from all over the world are demonstratively advancing towards Budapest. Recently, many more countries will hold peace conferences to unite the vast number of people across the nation to fight against new wars. The American Continental Congress for the Defense of World Peace is scheduled to be held on September 5. The All-India Trade Union Congress has decided to hold the All-India Peace Conference in November. The Japanese Democratic Women's Association also plans to hold a peace conference on August 15. The Executive Committee of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee recently proposed to designate October 2 as International Day for Struggle for Peace in order to launch a larger-scale global struggle to defend peace.
    The great movement for defending world peace and opposing war has unfolded more broadly and deeply since the Paris Peace Congress was held in April this year. Under the leadership of the Communist Parties and the working class in various countries, the people of all countries have held thousands of mass peace conferences and demonstrations. So far, peace committees have been established in the United States, Italy, Britain, Canada, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Finland, Greece, and many other countries to lead the struggle to defend peace in a unified manner. The people of the world have been further united and organized in the struggle to defend peace. Now, from the English Channel to the Japanese archipelago, from Australia to Norway, everywhere roars in unison: "No war!" "Down with the North Atlantic Treaty!" "Demand friendship with the Soviet Union!" "Long live peace!" The powerful pressure of the worldwide movement against war and for the defense of peace has forced the imperialists, who are preparing for war, to adopt the strategy of continuing negotiations with the Soviet Union. After the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, the negotiations between the four-power occupation authorities in Germany and the negotiations between the four-power command headquarters in Berlin have resumed. The former negotiation reached an agreement on the procedure for consultations between the four-power occupation authorities in Germany. The meeting of the Deputy Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers in London has also reached an agreement on some issues concerning the Austrian peace treaty. At present, negotiations are still underway in Berlin and London, although the continued obstruction by the United States will cause significant difficulties in the negotiations. However, what determines current international politics is no longer the imperialists' arrogant ambitions for world hegemony and war, but the united strength of peace-loving people all over the world.

### 美帝孤注一掷加紧备战  世界和平运动规模壮阔

    美帝孤注一掷加紧备战
    世界和平运动规模壮阔
    美国经济情势继续恶化。最近联合国秘书处发表的世界经济情况的报告，指出：美国工业生产量的下降是加速了，美国官方的人口统计局发表的大大缩小了的数字，也承认美国七月份失业人数较六月份增加了三十一万七千人，和去年七月比较，则猛增一百八十七万八千人。各种事实证明：美国经济危机的初期阶段——生产逐步下跌阶段，于去年十二月即已开始，七个月来，美国工业生产发生了全面性的直线下降。美国战后繁荣的顶点在去年秋天。去年十月和十一月，美国工业生产的指数曾达到一九五（以一九三五至一九三九年的平均数为一○○）。十二月成为美国战后经济的转折点。美国工业生产在十二月以后的指数如下：十二月——一九○，今年一月—一八七，二月—一八五，三月—一八一，四月—一七九，五月—一七四，六月—一六九。今年六月的工业生产指数和去年十月相比，下降了二十六点，即百分之十三。
    美帝国主义为了摆脱经济危机，已经并继续采取孤注一掷的积极准备战争的政策，虽然这是希特勒已经走过的死路。美国反动派和它的走卒们于今年四月签订了北大西洋公约以后，最近正积极进行实施北大西洋公约的各种活动。在美国反动派的积极策动下，在反动派占多数的情况下，现除荷兰外，各缔约国的国会已批准了这个作为准备战争之主要工具的北大西洋公约，现在只剩下荷兰参院没有批准了。和杜鲁门向国会提出作为北大西洋公约补充的所谓“军事援外计划”同时，美国陆海空三军参谋长又于七月三十日被派赴欧，和西欧反动派商讨成立北大西洋公约所规定的军事组织问题，并图强迫西欧诸国屈从于美国战略计划，使这些国家充当美国冒险政策的牺牲品。美国防部长詹森与陆军参谋总长布莱德雷七月二十九日在众院外委会为“军事援外计划”作证时，竟露骨地叫嚣战争，并公开地概述了“北大西洋军事联盟的计划”美国政府所采取的这些露骨的冒险措施，已引起欧洲人民的普遍警觉和反抗。法国共产党已号召举行大规模的示威，抗议美国的参谋长抵法。一种忧虑的情绪，甚至也反映在英国的保守的报纸上，伦敦泰晤士报说：大西洋两岸有着“一种迟疑不定的情绪，这种情绪表现为：‘郑重将事’，批评北大西洋公约的目的，怀疑这个公约的价值和必要性”。星期快报则对美国参谋长们的行动表示惊惧。它说：对于英国和英国男女来说，实现美国战争计划的结果，将是“令人骇怕，如果不是灾难性的话”。
    与美帝国主义者加紧准备战争同时，全世界人民正以更壮阔的规模开展着保卫和平的运动。世界青年第二届代表大会和青年节即将开幕，这个团结全世界青年为和平民主而斗争的盛会，已得到七十个国家民主青年的热烈支持。从世界各地前来的青年和平大队，正示威地向布达佩斯前进。最近又有许多国家将举行和平大会，团结全国广大人民为反对新战争而斗争。美洲大陆保卫世界和平大会已定于九月五日召开，全印职工大会已决定十一月间召开全印和平大会，日本民主妇人会也计划于八月十五日举行和平大会。世界和平大会常委会执委会最近建议定十月二日为国际和平斗争日，以便更大规模地展开全世界保卫和平的斗争。
    世界保卫和平和反对战争的大运动，自今年四月巴黎拥护和平大会召开以后，是更加广泛而深入地展开了。各国人民在各国共产党和工人阶级的领导下，举行了千百次群众性的和平大会、示威游行。至今为止，美、意、英、加、德、捷、波、罗、匈、芬、希以及其他许多国家，都已成立了和平委员会，统一领导保卫和平的斗争。全世界人民已在保卫和平的斗争中进一步团结和组织起来。现在，从英伦海峡到日本三岛，从澳大利亚到挪威，到处都齐声怒吼着：“不要战争！”“打倒北大西洋公约！”“要求对苏友谊！”“和平万岁！”全世界反对战争、保卫和平运动的强大压力，迫使正在准备战争的帝国主义不得不采取和苏联继续谈判的策略。在巴黎外长会议之后，德境的四国占领当局间的谈判和柏林的四国司令部间的谈判都恢复了，前一谈判并对德境四国占领当局之间进行磋商的程序获致协议。在伦敦举行的四国外长助理会议，关于对奥和约的若干问题，也已获致协议。目前，不论在柏林或在伦敦，谈判仍在进行中，尽管美国的继续阻挠还会使谈判发生重大困难；但是，决定目前国际政治的，已不是帝国主义者世界霸权和战争的狂妄念头，而是全世界爱好和平人民的团结力量。
