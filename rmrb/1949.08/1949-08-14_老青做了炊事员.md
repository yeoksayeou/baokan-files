Old Qing Becomes a Cook
Sun Ruofeng

I.

One evening, a reception team preparing to take over the Kuomintang-阎 [Yán] medical institutions in Taiyuan arrived at a village in Yuci County. The advance team led the people into the courtyards in batches.

When Lao Gao and his group entered the imposing gate that had been designated for them, the landlord came out to greet them, accompanied by a furiously barking dog. This was a man in his fifties, short and thin, wearing a half-worn blue gown. His yellowish-white face wore a fake smile, and his eyes blinked frequently. He said:

"Ah! Officers have arrived, you must be tired! Please come in, please come in… We have long been welcoming officers, long welcoming..."

The landlord spoke with hateful politeness, ushering us into the north room of the outer courtyard. This spacious room was probably a reception room in the past. The old-fashioned tables and chairs of Phoebe zhennan wood were covered with a layer of dust. The unlit coal stove had a tattered mat on it. The early winter wind blew in from the door, which had no curtain, and the holes in the window paper, bringing in dust and taking away warmth.

They settled down in this room.

The family's head chef, Da Hei [Big Black], was the first to become acquainted with everyone. Whenever he came, he always sat on the kang [platform bed], wiping his hands with his apron, repeating to everyone: The rich are no good, I've been cooking for twenty years and haven't met a good one, our master is exceptionally bad...

This family used to be very rich! Several acres of land were rented out. People could eat delicious food without firing a shot, with maids and servants at their beck and call. The county magistrate and district chief were all his sworn brothers. Who would dare to provoke him?

As soon as you came, the whole family ran to Taiyuan! I heard they suffered a lot. Serves them right! The master took his concubine and hid in the home of a poor relative for a few days. Seeing that nothing happened, he came back again. Now he needs the poor relatives!

"People from the district came and held a meeting for us! It's time for the poor to speak up!"

He also asked Lao Gao when the Kuomintang troops would be completely wiped out, what land reform was all about, and so on.

The master also came to chat sometimes. He came to test the waters and didn't sincerely listen to everyone's explanations and education. Moreover, his insidious and artificial smile made it hard not to dislike him, so no one welcomed him.

The old man hired by the landlord to do odd jobs often passed by the door, but he never came in once.

II.

That old man was called Lao Qing [Old Qing]. His gray-white, disheveled beard squeezed his dark, thin face, which was etched with deep lines, making it seem even smaller and more pitiful. He wore clothes patched with rags of various colors, and his waist was tied with a broken hemp rope tied with knots.

His tasks were extremely heavy - feeding livestock, grinding flour - the flour that couldn't be eaten was taken to the market to sell - carrying water to feed pigs and dogs, cleaning the livestock pens... He had to do everything, and he was busy all day long. At night, he slept in the livestock shed, on a small, unheated kang, covered with some straw and a tattered mat. A broken sheepskin coat was his only bedding. The landlord's courtyard was a prison that he could not break out of, nor dared to break out of. Except for carrying water, he never went outside the gate. All this was only for a bowl of cold rice brought to his room for each meal.

One evening, Lao Qing, as usual, carried water, watered the livestock, swept the ground, and swept the firewood leaves out of the trash and put them on the woodpile, dumping the remaining dirt into the pigsty.

"Old man, please come and sit in this room for a while!" - Lao Gao greeted him.

Lao Qing, after hesitantly recognizing that he was being called, quickly replied, "Yes, yes," put down the basket, and walked into the room.

Everyone asked him to sit on the grand master chair in the room. He took the cigarette that Lao Gao gave him with trembling hands, lit it on the lamp, and said with a bitter smile while smoking:

"I've never smoked a cigarette in my life. I couldn't afford to smoke before. Since I've been doing this job where I don't earn a penny, I can't even afford to smoke dry tobacco."

"Why does your accent sound so familiar? Where are you from?" the communications clerk, Xiao Wang [Little Wang], asked.

"Henan."

"I'm from Henan too! How did you end up so far away working?"

"Who do you have in your family, old man?" Lao Gao also chimed in to ask.

"Alas!" Lao Qing said in his low, hoarse voice, pensively: "It breaks my heart to talk about it! We used to have a few acres of land at home, and renting a few acres from the landlord, my son and I worked hard, and his mother spun some thread, and we could barely make ends meet. After the July 7th Incident, my son was conscripted into the Kuomintang army, and we haven't heard from him since. There were years of famine, and it cost a lot to farm, so we sold a few acres of land. My little girl was sent to her husband's family when she was fifteen. My wife couldn't walk, so she stayed at home begging for food, and I fled the famine. When I arrived in Shanxi, I didn't know anyone, and I had no one to turn to! I had no choice but to find a job here where I only get food, and I've been here for five years."

"My wife, my children, who knows if they are still alive?" The more he spoke, the lower his voice became, and tears welled up in his old eyes.

Everyone was silent for a moment. In the silence, it seemed that one could hear the old man's heart beating weakly.

"Why don't you go home?" Xiao Wang broke the silence.

"It's good to go home! But what would I eat when I got back? What would I eat!"

"Our home has also been liberated. Land reform will be implemented there, and there will be land to cultivate and food to eat," Xiao Wang told him.

"What is land reform?"

"Land reform? Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the peasants unite, eliminate the landlord class, and give land to peasants with little or no land," Xiao Wang explained enthusiastically.

"Really? That would be great. I've lived such a long life, and I've only heard of such good things now!" Hope shone in Lao Qing's tearful eyes.

"Of course it's true. My family was also given five acres of land! Our People's Liberation Army wouldn't lie!" Xiao Wang said with enthusiasm.

"How does the master treat you?" Lao Gao changed the subject and asked.

Lao Qing's joy suddenly disappeared, and he showed a bitter smile, snorted through his nose, and shook his head.

"Lao Qing! Lao Qing! Dinner's ready, where did that old guy go!?" The head chef shouted at the entrance of the inner courtyard.

He hurriedly stood up and said in a low voice, "You sit here, comrades," and went out.

III.

Lao Qing's face has become even more yellow in recent days, and his eye sockets have also sunk deeply. The water has been changed to the head chef to carry. According to Xiao Wang, he saw Lao Qing squatting in the corner of the livestock shed cooking something, probably decocting medicine.

What's wrong with him? Is he sick? - everyone guessed.

This day, Lao Qing finished eating and brought the bowl back. Lao Gao called him into the room.

"You look worse and worse. What's wrong with you?" everyone asked him.

"I have a lump under my armpit, and I can't work."

Lao Gao helped him unbutton the tattered lined coat and felt under his armpit. He felt a hard lump the size of an egg, and that area was red and swollen, and he had a high fever.

"Have you treated it?" Lao Gao asked him.

"The master had me take a dose of herbal medicine, but it didn't get any better."

"Xiao Wang, quickly call Doctor Yao!" Lao Gao called out to Xiao Wang.

After Lao Gao and Doctor Yao consulted, they believed that the disease was either lymphadenitis or malignant carcinoma. Judging from his age and the unknown cause, the latter was more likely. If not thoroughly treated, delaying it for a few more days, he might be crippled, or even in danger of losing his life.

What should we do? There are no instruments or medicines - or, we could send him to a certain surgical team for treatment. Maybe it will work if we discuss it with them - they discussed it this way.

By the time Lao Gao had negotiated the treatment and accommodation issues and returned from a certain surgical team on his bicycle, it was dark.

Lao Qing was naturally happy to hear that he would be sent to the hospital for treatment and recuperation. After Lao Gao and the others repeatedly mobilized him, the master had no choice but to agree. The next day, Lao Gao accompanied him to the surgical team. The result was lymphadenitis, and the treatment went very well.

Lao Qing stayed there to recuperate.

On the sixth day after the operation, Lao Gao went to see him again. As soon as he entered the courtyard, he saw Lao Qing. He was wearing an old military coat that someone had given him, and he was delivering a bedpan to the toilet for someone else. When he saw Lao Gao, he immediately shouted:

"You saved my old life! I'm getting better, look!" As he said this, he opened his coat to untie the snow-white bandage, but Lao Gao didn't let him untie it.

Lao Gao followed him into the room and sat on the kang. A wounded soldier in the same room greeted Lao Gao and continued to read a book while lying down. Lao Qing stroked the dark green new quilt that covered him and said:

"Look how good this quilt is! I haven't had a decent quilt in five years..." As he said this, his eyes welled up again. He poured out everything to Lao Gao: how the master treated him like an animal, how he didn't even come to see him once when he was sick, nor gave him a penny, and he talked about how domineering the master used to be, and how the villagers hated and feared him.

Finally, he said firmly: "The People's Liberation Army treats me so well, I will never go back. I see that there is a shortage of cooks here, so I will be a cook! You talk to the higher-ups about it." Lao Gao agreed to talk to the surgical team about this matter.

When he was leaving, Lao Qing saw him off and repeatedly instructed him: "You must remember to ask the higher-ups for me!"

IV.

When Lao Gao was sent to the Taiyuan front again, he passed by the location of a certain surgical team and met Lao Qing again. He was drawing water at the well.

He was almost unrecognizable. He was wearing a military uniform all over, with a little oil stain on the front of his clothes; his beard was trimmed, and his face was ruddy; he looked at least ten years younger than before.

He saw Lao Gao from afar, holding the water bucket, and shouted: "Comrade Gao, it's been a long time since I've seen you! Where have you been? Come and take a break in our kitchen!"

    老青做了炊事员
    孙若风
    一
    傍晚，准备去接收太原阎匪医疗机关的一支接收队，开到了榆次县某村，先头来设营的人把大家一批一批的领进房院。
    当老高他们走进被指定的那个阔气的大门时，房东随着一只狂吠的狗出来迎接他们。这是一个五十来岁的人，短瘦的身材，穿着一件半旧的蓝大袍，黄白色的脸上装着谦伪的笑，眼频频的眨着，说：
    “啊！官长们来啦，累啦吧！里面请，里面请……早就欢迎官长们来，早欢迎……”
    地主房东说着讨厌的客气话，把我们让进了外院的北房，这间宽绰的屋子大概以前是客厅。楠木的旧式桌椅上蒙着一层尘土，没有生着火的煤火炕上铺着一领破席，初冬的风从没有门帘的门和窗纸的破洞吹进来，送来尘土带走温暖。
    他们就在这间屋子住下来。
    这家的大师傅大黑最先和大家熟识的，他一来总是坐在炕上用围裙擦着手和大家重复着说：财主们没球好的，我作了二十年饭没碰见一个，我们这个当家的分外的坏………。
    这家早先可阔啦！好几顷地都租出去，人家不费一刀一枪就吃香的喝甜的，丫环当差的使着，县长区长都是他的盟兄把弟，谁敢惹他？
    你们一来，一家子都跑到太原去啦！听说受了洋罪，真球活该！当家的带着小婆子跑到穷亲戚家躲了几天，见没事才又回来了，这会儿用着穷亲戚啦！
    “区上来人了，给我们开了会啦！这回可该着穷人说说话咧！”
    他还询问老高什么时候才能把勾子军消灭完，土地改革是怎么回事等。
    当家的也有时来拉话，他是来探口风的，并不真心听大家对他的解释教育，同时他那阴险造作的笑，使人很难不讨厌，因而谁也不欢迎他来。
    被房东雇来打杂的那个老头，虽常在门前走过，但从未来过一次。
  二
    那个老头叫老青，他那灰白色的乍蓬棵胡须，挤的他那一张黑瘦而刻有深深的线条的脸越显得小的可怜，穿着用各种颜色的破布补着的衣服，腰里束着一条接着疙瘩的破麻绳头。
    他的任务是极重的——喂牲口，磨面——磨的面吃不了拿到集上去卖——担水喂猪喂狗，出牲口圈……什么都得干，整天价忙。晚上睡在牲口棚里，一个不烧火的小炕，上面垫着一些谷草，铺一片破席，一件破皮袄是他唯一的铺盖，当家的院子是他打不破也不敢打破的囚笼，他除了挑水从不到门外去，这一切，只是为了每餐端到他自己屋里吃的一碗冷饭。
    一天傍晚，老青照例挑过水，饮罢牲口，扫过地后把垃圾内的柴禾叶用扫帚漫出放到柴堆上，把其余的脏土倒在猪圈里。
    “老大伯，请到这屋里坐会儿吧！”——老高招呼他。
    老青惶惑的辨清是在叫他后，连忙答应“嗯，嗯，”放下筐走进屋里。
    大家让他坐到屋里的太师椅子上，他用颤抖的手接过老高给他的烟，在灯上点着后一边吸一边苦笑着说：
    “我一辈子没抽过烟卷，以前舍不得抽，自从作了这一个钱也不挣的活，旱烟也抽不上了。”
    “怎么我听着你的口音这么熟啊？你是那里人？”通信员小王问。
    “河南人。”
    “我也是河南人哪！你怎么跑出这么远做活来啦？”
    “家里都有什么人啦老大伯？”老高也插进来问。
    “唉！”老青沉思地用他那低哑的声音说：“提起来叫人心酸！早先家里还有几亩地，再租上财主家几亩，我和俺小子跑腾着，孩子他娘纺点线，还凑合着吃碗饭。七七以后，儿子叫蒋匪抓去当了兵，连个音信也没有，连年闹灾荒，种地花销又大，把几亩地都卖了，小妮子，十五岁上就送到婆家去，老婆子走不动，留在家里要饭，我就逃荒出来了，到了山西，人生地不熟，投奔谁呀！没法子在这里找了个光吃饭不挣钱的活，一呆五年了。”
    “老婆，孩子，谁知道他们还活着没有呢？”他越说声音越低，泪花湿润了他的老眼。
    大家一时都没有话说，在寂静里，好象能听到这位老人的心在微弱的搏动着。
    “你为什么不回家呢？”小王打破了这沉寂。
    “回家是好呵！吃着什么回去呢？回去吃什么啊！”
    “咱家那边也解放了，那里也要实行土地改革，有地种也有饭吃。”小王告诉他说。
    “什么是土地改革啊？”
    “土地改革吗？就是在共产党领导下，农民都团结起来，消灭了地主阶级，使无地或少地的农民都分得一份土地。”小王热情的解释着。
    “真的吗？那可就好了，我活了这么大年纪，才听说这样的好事！”老青含泪的眼冒出了希望。
    “当然是真的，我家还分了五亩地哩！我们解放军就不会说瞎话！”小王眉飞色舞的讲。
    “当家的待你怎么样？”老高转了话题问。
    老青的高兴顿然消失了，露着苦笑，用鼻子哼了一声，摇了摇头。
    “老青！老青！吃饭了，那里去了这老家伙！？”大师傅在里院门口喊着。
    他匆匆地站起来，低声说了句：“你们坐着吧，同志们。”就走出去了。
  三
    老青的脸，近几天更黄了，眼窝也深深的陷下去。水已换了大师傅来挑，据小王说：他看见老青蹲在牲口棚那儿的墙角处煮什么来，可能是煎药。
    他怎么啦？是不是病了呢？——大家猜想着。
    这天，老青吃完饭送碗回来，老高把他叫到屋里来。
    “你这模样越来越不好了，你怎么啦？”大家问他。
    “胳肢窝底下长了个疙瘩，作不了活了。”
    老高帮他解开破掩襟棉袄的扣子，往他腋下一摸，摸着那硬块有鸡蛋大，那一片又红又肿，全身也发着高烧。
    “治过没有？”老高问他。
    “当家的让吃了一付草药，也不见轻。”
    “小王，快叫姚医生来！”老高招呼着小王。
    老高和姚医生会诊后，认为这病不是淋巴腺炎就是恶性癌瘤。按他的年龄和原因不明来判断，后者的可能性很大；若不彻底治疗，再延宕几天，恐怕就有残废的可能，甚至有生命的危险。
    这怎么办呢？既没有器械又没有药品——要不，就送他到某手术队去治疗吧，和他们商量商量也许行，——他俩这样商量着。
    当老高交涉好了治疗食宿等问题，从某手术队骑自行车回来时，天就黑了。
    老青一听让他到医院治疗休养，自然欢喜，当家的经老高他们再三动员也只好答允了。第二天，老高即伴他一同去手术队，结果是淋巴腺炎，治疗经过的很好。
    老青留在那里休养。
    手术后的第六天，老高又去看他。一进院就看见了老青，他穿着不知谁给他的一件旧军袄，正替别人把大便器送到厕所里，当他看见老高时立即喊着说：
    “你们救了我一条老命！我快好了，你看！”说着他把棉袄掀开，要解那雪白的绷带，老高没有让他解。
    老高随着他走到屋里，坐在炕上。屋里烘得很暖，同屋的一个伤员招呼了老高一声，仍拿着一本书躺着看。老青抚摩着他盖的那床暗绿色的新被子说：
    “你看这被子多好哇！我五年连破被子也没盖过……”说着他的眼圈又红了，他向老高尽情的倾吐着：当家的是怎样的当牲口一样的奴役着他，现在他病了，连一次也不来看，一个钱也不梢，并把当家的过去是怎样的霸道，乡亲们如何恨他和怕他都谈出来。
    最后，他坚决的说：“解放军待我这么好，我说什么也不回去了。我看见这里伙夫挺缺，我就当个伙夫吧！你给上头说说。”老高答应他把这事跟手术队谈谈。
    临行时，老青送出来还叮嘱说：“你千万可记住给我向上级要求要求！”
  四
    当老高再被派到太原前线时，路经某手术队住处又碰见了老青，他正在井台上打水。
    几乎认不出他来了，他全身都穿着军衣，前襟微微油污了一点；胡子修短了，脸上红光光的；看来起码比过去年轻了十岁。
    他大远的就看见了老高，扶着水担，喊道：“高同志，日子多了不见你啦！你到那儿去啦？快到我们伙房里歇歇吧！”
