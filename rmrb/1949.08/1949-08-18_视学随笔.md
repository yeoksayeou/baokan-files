　　Random Notes on Education

　　--The cultural wounds inflicted by the bandits are being sought to be healed by the people; knowledge youth willing to devote themselves to the people’s motherland, please go to the glorious post of "rural teacher"--

　　On the evening of July 29th, I arrived in the newly liberated city of Anyang, the last city liberated in North China. The trenches and bunkers relied upon by the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang still remained. On the wall of a factory near the city gate, there were honeycomb-like bullet marks. Needless to say, there had been fierce fighting here. The Provincial No. 2 High School, originally near the Anyang River, was mostly in ruins when viewed from afar, with windows without roofs, like a wounded person widening his eyes, waiting for treatment. The bandits turned the school into rubble. Anyang was originally the cultural center of northern Henan. There were more than a dozen public and private secondary schools. During the Henan-North battles three years prior, American-made planes carried male and female students to Zhengzhou and Xuchang, collectively joining the army or being conscripted for marriage. Only five remained before the city was attacked. For more than ten years, the simple and hardworking people of northern Henan groaned under the rule of bandits, bullies, and petty feudal lords, and were even deprived of the opportunity to receive primary education.

　　I remember Chairman Mao said in "On Protracted War": "The enemy has turned our past cultural center into a culturally backward area, and we must turn the past culturally backward area into a cultural center." Today's facts here further prove the foresight of the people's leader. According to Section Chief Qian of the Anyang Fifth Administrative Office, a statistic of the nine counties under the jurisdiction of the special district, namely Anyang, Lin, Ci, Wu, She, Ye, Zhangnan, Tang, and Qi: The population is 2,321,078, and the number of school-age children is 332,844, accounting for 14.3 percent of the population. The number of children in school is 97,638. The average number of school-age children in the nine counties is 29.3 percent, of which the number of school-age children in the old revolutionary base area counties is 42 percent; looking at the entire special district, the number of children out of school is still about 70 percent, 58 percent in the old revolutionary base areas, and more than 80 percent in the new areas. This statistic shows that the history of old and new areas has undergone a reverse change. Lin, She, and Wu in the old revolutionary base area are mountainous areas, which have always been barren and poor, with backward culture; Anyang, Ye, Qi, Tang, Zhangnan and other counties in the new area are plains, and also benefit from water conservancy irrigation, with abundant products, and have always been culturally advanced areas. Who made the culturally advanced areas regress? Who made the culturally backward areas advanced? This is a clear contrast.

　　Now here, the desolate farmlands in the suburbs have long been restored to production, and the commercial districts in the city have been re-prospering; but what about the cultural wounds created by the enemy? How to heal it? Local educators are racking their brains for this urgent problem of the people. I attended the conference of county normal school principals in the special district and heard that in Ye County, with a population of more than 400,000, it was difficult to restore two complete primary schools. The first difficulty was the lack of teachers. The bandit gangs abducted the teachers, and the students only had first and second graders. The bandit gangs interrupted education. The current number of teachers in the entire special district is 2,541, of which 2,422 are male teachers and 119 are female teachers. If four years of universal education are implemented, at least 8,321 teachers are needed, and the shortfall is 5,780. However, most of the existing 2,541 teachers need to improve their cultural and political quality. According to the statistics of seven counties in the special district: among the 905 teachers, judging solely by cultural ability, 336 can teach first and second grades, and 579 can teach third and fourth grades, that is to say, about 40 percent of the current teachers need to improve their cultural learning. This statistic also shows that the teachers who are responsible for healing cultural wounds are small in number and low in quality.

　　There are currently eight county normal schools in the Fifth Special District, with a total of twenty-six classes. With an average of forty people per class, there are a total of 1,040 people. With the existing reserve teachers, supplementing the shortage of 5,000 to 7,000 will take at least six or seven years. This situation tells us that a task, also a bright path, for the vast group of intellectuals remaining in Pingjin is that the working people need us to assist in improving their culture. The working people need us to help educate their children. Knowledgeable youths willing to devote themselves to the construction of the people's motherland, please go to the most glorious post of "rural teacher"!

　　Writing here, I am reminded of two young teachers I met on the way who had resigned. One was in the reception room of the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau, meeting a female classmate who graduated from Tianjin Provincial Normal School. After receiving short-term training in Baoding, she was assigned to work as a teacher in rural central Hebei. She took a long leave of absence shortly after taking office and asked the Education Bureau to assign her to work in Tianjin. According to her, there were more than a dozen others who had also taken long leave. The other was on the bus on the way back, meeting a young man who graduated from Zhangde Provincial High School. He was teaching in Huojia County, disliked the rural cultural environment, and traveled thousands of miles to seek refuge in Beiping, willing to find a tutor position. Both of these are healthy and straightforward young people, why did they leave the job most needed by the working people? And trek thousands of miles to be a tutor? Isn’t this the result of the old education alienating them from the working people? Their eyes are always on the big cities of Pingjin. They express their prosperity when crowded in the cities. Once they step on the land of the working people, they shrink.

　　This morbid phenomenon cannot be blamed on the youth. Tracing back to the source, we should find out what the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs used to educate the youth, creating flaws in the souls of the youth. This is another cultural wound inflicted by the bandits. How to heal this wound? How to cultivate young students' feelings for the working people? The working people bear all our educational expenses, and they have the right to demand that we train the people they need for them.

    ——匪徒们造下的文化创伤，人民要求我们医治；愿意献身人民祖国的知识青年，请到“乡村教师”这个光荣岗位去——
    七月二十九号傍晚，笔者到了新解放的安阳城，她是华北解放最晚的城市。日寇和蒋家匪帮们凭借的壕沟和堡垒还残留着，在靠近城门的一家工厂的围墙上，留着蜂巢似的弹痕。不言而喻，在这里是经过较剧烈的战斗。原在安阳河近旁的省立二高中校舍，远远望去，大部成了残垣断壁，没了楼顶的楼窗，象受伤者睁大他的眼睛，期待医治，匪徒们把学府化为瓦砾了。安阳原是豫北的文化中心，曾有公私立中等学校十几处，在前三年豫北战役时，美造飞机把男女学生载到郑州、许昌，集体地参了军，或征了婚，攻城前夕只残留五处了。十几年来，朴实、勤劳的豫北人民，呻吟在土匪、恶霸、小封建领主的辖治下，连受小学教育的机会也被剥夺了。
    记得毛主席在“论持久战”上说道：“敌人已将我们过去文化中心变为文化落后区域，而我们则要将过去的文化落后区域，变为文化中心”。今天这里的事实更证明了人民领袖的预见。据安阳五专署钱科长谈，该专区所辖安、林、磁、武、涉、邺、漳南、汤、淇九个县统计：有人口二三二一零七八人，学龄儿童共三三二八四四人，占人口百分之十四点三，入学儿童九七六三八人，九县平均占学龄儿童的百分之二九点三，其中老区县份入学儿童占学龄儿童的百分之四十二；就全专区看，失学儿童尚在百分之七十左右，老区有百分之五十八，新区占百分之八十以上。这个统计，表明新老区的历史，已发生了一个相反的变化。老区林、涉、武是山地，向来是地瘠民贫，文化落后；新区安、邺、淇、汤、漳南等县是平原，又得水利灌溉，物产丰饶，向来是文化先进区，谁使文化先进的地区倒退了？谁使文化落后的地区先进了？这是鲜明的对照。
    现在在这儿，郊外的荒芜田园，早都恢复了生产，市区的商业已重新繁荣起来了；可是敌人制造的文化创伤呢？如何医好它？地方的教育工作者们，正为人民这个迫切问题绞着脑汁。笔者参加了该专区的县立师范校长会议，听到在四十多万人口的邺县，恢复两座完小都感到困难，首先是缺教师，匪帮们把教师劫持走了，学生仅有一、二年级的，匪帮们使教育中断了；全专区现任师资是二五四一人，其中男教师二四二二人，女教师一一九人，如果实施四年的普及教育，至少需要师资八三二一人，缺额是五七八零人，但现有师资二五四一人，文化政治质量大部分需要提高。又据该专区七个县的统计：在九零五个教员中，单就文化能力衡量，能教一二年级的三三六人，能教三四年级的五七九人，那就是说尚有百分之四十左右的现任教师需要提高文化学习。这个统计又说明了负担医治文化创伤的教师，数量是少的，质量是低的。
    五专区现有八座县立师范，共二十六个班，每班平均以四十人计共一零四零人，以现有的后备师资，补充五千至七千的缺额，至少要经过六、七年的时间。这种情况告诉我们留在平、津的广大知识分子群，一个任务也是一条光明的出路，就是劳动人民需要我们去协助提高文化。劳动人民需要我们协助教养孩子，愿意献身人民祖国建设事业的知识青年们，请到“乡村教师”这个最光荣的岗位去吧！
    笔者写到这里，又联想起途中相遇的两位离职的青年教师来。一起是在天津市教育局的会客室里，会见一位省立天津师范毕业的女同学，她是在保定接受短训后，分配到冀中农村做教师的，到职不久便请了长假，又请求教育局分配她在天津工作。据她说还有十来位也请了长假。另一起是在回途的汽车上，遇到一位原在彰德省立高中毕业的青年，他是在获嘉县教书，嫌农村文化环境不好，于是不远千里投奔北平而来，愿意找个家庭教师的位置。这两位都是身体健康，爽直的青年，为什么离开劳动人民最需要的工作岗位而去？又远跋千里做一个家庭教师？这不是旧教育使他们和劳动人民隔阂的结果吗？他们的眼睛总是望着平津大城市，拥挤在城市他们就表示欣欣向荣，一旦脚踏在劳动人民的园地上，他们就萎缩了。
    这个病态的现象，不能归咎青年。追本寻源我们应找到蒋家匪帮们用什么教育了青年，给青年们的灵魂上造下了缺陷。这又是匪徒们造下的文化创伤。如何医治这种创伤？如何培养青年学生对劳动人民的感情呢？劳动人民肩负着我们全部的教育经费，他们有权力责成我们，为他们培养所需要的人。
