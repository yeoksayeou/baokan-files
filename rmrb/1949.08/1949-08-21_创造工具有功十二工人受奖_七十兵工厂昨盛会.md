　　Twelve Workers Rewarded for Contributions to Tool Creation
    Grand Gathering at Factory 70 Yesterday
    [This Municipality News] Factory 70 held a production innovation award ceremony yesterday (the 20th) afternoon. The award recipients included Fu Wanyu, Zhang Deshan, Li Hongting, Wang Qian, Tang Zhishan, Zhao Yuchun, Lin Yuchun, Liu Shixian, Men Ziming, Wu Feng, Yuan Hongbin, and Zhang Kun, totaling twelve individuals. Amidst thunderous applause from hundreds of employees, Zhou Wenbin, the director of the trade union, presented flowers, medals, shirts, notebooks, and other prizes to each of the awardees. The awarded workers, Fu Wanyu, Zhang Deshan, and others, spoke one after another. They unanimously pointed out that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can workers unleash their creative initiative, and only then can workers enjoy such glory. The tools invented and improved by these awarded workers have greatly contributed to increasing production and reducing costs. For example, the helical gear cutting tool created by Fu Wanyu increased production ninefold. Zhang Deshan created the top eye punch, saving two-thirds of the labor, and manufactured tools for punching rivets (previously, rivets had to be purchased from outside). Li Hongting created the Type 88 anti-aircraft gun disassembly and assembly tool, which now allows two people to complete in half an hour what previously required four people a whole day. Wang Qian's improved tool for punching reinforcing covers doubled production. Zhao Yuchun's improved sleeve knife increased production tenfold. Zhang Kun transformed a hand-cranked grinder into an automatic grinder, increasing production threefold. Men Ziming created a hanging disc bending device, increasing production fourfold. At the meeting, military representative Jia Xiaodong called for cooperation between mental and manual labor and for the promotion of a collective spirit of innovation to increase production and reduce costs.
