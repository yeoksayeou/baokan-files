Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th – The United States Department of State published a 1,054-page white paper on “United States Relations with China” on the 5th of this month, the main points of which have been broadcast by the United States Information Service. The white paper begins with a letter from U.S. Secretary of State Acheson to U.S. President Truman. Acheson's letter admits that the U.S. government's efforts to aid the Kuomintang in attacking the Chinese people's democratic forces have failed. Acheson admits that the Kuomintang government had long lost the support of the people, while the people's liberation struggle led by the Chinese Communist Party was supported by the vast majority of the Chinese people, "Under these circumstances, our aid was ineffective." Acheson continued: "The unfortunate but also unavoidable fact is that the unfortunate outcome of the Chinese civil war was beyond the control of the United States government. The United States has done or could have done within the reasonable limits of its capabilities and cannot change this outcome. What the United States has not done has not affected this outcome. This is the product of internal forces in China, which the United States has also tried to influence, but could not effectively."

Acheson's letter and the U.S. policy documents on China collected in the white paper openly advocate interference in China's internal affairs. These documents incompletely list the U.S. government's aid to the Kuomintang government and the Kuomintang army, and state that the purpose of this aid was to help and encourage "the Kuomintang to establish its authority in as large an area as possible in China." The Kuomintang is described in the white paper as a corrupt and reactionary group that has lost the trust and support of the people. Although the attempt to establish the Kuomintang to serve the United States' aggressive interests has been deemed a failure, the United States government declares that it will not relax its efforts to continue to undermine the Chinese people's democratic cause from within and outside China. In his letter to Truman, Acheson slandered the Chinese people's people's democracy, which opposes imperialist aggression, as a "foreign system" that "serves the interests of the Soviet Union," and asserted that the traitorous activities of the feudal comprador forces that the United States attempted to organize in China against the people's democratic system in the future would revive what he called "China's long-standing civilization and democratic individualism." Acheson said: "China's long-standing civilization and democratic individualism will eventually triumph again, and China will eventually overthrow the foreign system. I think we should encourage all developments in China that work now or in the future to achieve these goals." Acheson issued a statement on the 6th of this month, reiterating this conspiracy to continue to interfere in China's internal affairs. According to the terminology of the U.S. Department of State, this conspiracy is called "encouraging developments that can promote China to become an independent and stable country," "assisting China in safeguarding basic human rights and freedoms," "opposing the subordination of China to any foreign country," "continuing to consult with other relevant countries," and "encouraging and supporting the United Nations in achieving efforts to maintain peace and security in the Far East," and so on. What is the true meaning of these obscure terms of the U.S. Department of State? This is already shown in the white paper's record of how the U.S. government aided the Kuomintang reactionary group in carrying out counter-revolutionary civil war.

The white paper maliciously denigrates the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party, while angrily scolding the incompetence of the Kuomintang reactionaries and their failure to fully obey U.S. commands, resulting in the failure of U.S. aid. The U.S. government repeatedly declares in the white paper that the responsibility for the government's failure to intervene in China should be borne by the Kuomintang. In its forced defense of its failure, the U.S. government even attributes it to President Roosevelt's proposed Yalta Agreement, to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance concluded on this basis, which played a major role in the war against Japan, and to the Soviet Union's failure to aid the Kuomintang in the Chinese civil war against the Chinese people, as the United States did. But the white paper here falls into contradiction. Acheson's lengthy preface emphasized that the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War was "the product of internal forces in China." In addition, the white paper confirms that it was the U.S. government that tried to extend its aggressive forces into the Northeast. The white paper indicates that "the United States transported a considerable number of Kuomintang troops to the ports of entry in the Northeast." The white paper publishes the previously unpublished Wedemeyer Report on his visit to China, which recommended that the United Nations place the Northeast of China under the guardianship or trusteeship of the five powers.

### 美帝发表关于中国问题白皮书  供认援匪政策可耻失败  阴谋继续破坏中国人民革命

    美帝发表关于中国问题白皮书
    供认援匪政策可耻失败
    阴谋继续破坏中国人民革命
    【新华社北平十二日电】美国国务院于本月五日发表一篇题为“中美关系”的长达一千零五十四页的白皮书，其内容要点已由美国新闻处陆续广播。白皮书以美国国务卿艾奇逊给美国总统杜鲁门的一封信为序文。艾奇逊的信件承认美国政府援助国民党进攻中国人民民主力量的努力已经失败。艾奇逊承认国民党政府早已失去人民的支持，而中国共产党所领导的人民解放斗争则为中国广大人民所拥护，“在这种情形之下，我们的援助至于无效”。艾奇逊继续说：“不幸的但亦无法逃避的事实，是中国内战的不幸结果为美国政府控制所不及。美国在她能力的合理限度以内，所曾经做过或能够做的都不能改变这个结果。美国所未做的对于这个结果也没有影响。这是中国内部势力的产物，这些势力，美国亦曾试图加以影响，但不能有效。”
    艾奇逊的信和收集在白皮书内的美国对华政策文件，都公然主张干涉中国内政。这些文件不完全地列举了美国政府对国民党政府和国民党军队的援助，并声明这些援助的目的是为了帮助和鼓励“国民党尽可能在中国广大的地区上建立它的权威”，而国民党则被白皮书描写为一个腐败的丧失人民信任和支持的反动集团。经过国民党来建立服务于美国侵略利益的企图虽然已被认为失败，但是美国政府宣称它将仍不放松从中国内部和外部继续破坏中国人民民主事业的努力。艾奇逊在致杜鲁门的信中诋毁中国人民反对帝国主义侵略的人民民主政治是“为苏联利益服务”的“外来制度”，同时断言美国所企图在中国今后组织的封建买办势力反对人民民主制度的叛国活动，将使他所说的“中国的悠久文明和民主个人主义”复活。艾奇逊说：“中国的悠久文明和民主个人主义终将再度胜利，中国终将推翻外来制度。我认为我们应当鼓励在中国的一切发展，这些发展在现在或将来都是为了达到上述目标而工作。”艾奇逊又在本月六日发表声明，重申这种继续干涉中国内政的阴谋，这种阴谋按照美国国务院的术语是称为“鼓励凡能促中国成为独立而稳定的国家之发展”，“协助中国保障基本人权与自由”，“反对将中国隶属于任何外国”，“继续与其他有关国家咨商”，“鼓励并支持联合国达成维持远东和平与安全之努力”等等。美国国务院的这些隐晦的术语的真正意义为何，这是白皮书关于美国政府如何援助国民党反动集团进行反革命内战的记录所已经表明了的。
    白皮书一面恶毒地抵毁中国人民和中国共产党，另一方面又恼怒地责骂国民党反动派的无能与没有完全听从美国指挥，致使美国的浩大援助归于无效。美国政府在白皮书中再三宣称该政府干涉中国失败的责任应由国民党担负。美国政府在强词辩解自己的失败时，甚至把它归咎于罗斯福总统所建议的雅尔达协定，归咎于以此为基础而缔结的在对日作战中起了重大作用的中苏友好同盟条约，归咎于苏联没有象美国一样地在中国内战中援助国民党来反对中国人民。但是白皮书在这里自己陷于矛盾。艾奇逊的长篇序文曾着重地声明中国人民解放战争的胜利是“中国内部势力的产物”。此外，白皮书证实了正是美国政府曾力图将侵略势力伸入东北。白皮书指明“美国运送了相当庞大的国民党军队到东北进口处的各港口”。白皮书公布了迄未公布的魏德迈访华报告，这个报告曾建议联合国把中国东北置于五强监护或联合国托管之下。
