    [Shanghai News] The Gauze Export Company, affiliated with the East China Foreign Trade Corporation, has been prepared and officially opened for business on July 20th at 74 Dianchi Road. In order to centralize the handling of gauze export business, the authorities abolished the partially liquidated Puppet Ministry of Economic Affairs Textile Export Committee at the end of last month, with the Gauze Export Company taking over all its responsibilities. All contracts, bills of lading, and import/export license seals previously affixed by the Textile Export Committee will be replaced by the Gauze Export Company's seal starting from August 1st. Manufacturers with unfinished contracts with the former Textile Export Committee can still contact the Gauze Export Company for handling.
    [Another News Item] According to the Provisional Measures for the Administration of Gauze Exports, manufacturers in this city who engaged in the export of gauze and other special commodities before liberation must complete the necessary procedures for importing raw materials and machinery with the foreign exchange earned from exports. If such import responsibilities have not been fulfilled, or if foreign exchange settlement procedures have not been completed, they should register with the East China Foreign Trade Administration before the end of this month for verification and processing.

    华东区成立纱布外销公司
    集中办理外销业务
    伪经济部外销会已予撤销
    【上海讯】华东区国外贸易总公司所属纱布外销公司已筹备就绪，业于七月二十日在滇池路七十四号正式办公。当局为集中办理纱布外销业务起见，已将伪经济部纺织品外销委员会清理部分，于上月底撤销，由纱布外销公司全部接管，所有前纺织品外销委员会对外签盖的合约、提单进出口许可证的印鉴，自本月一日起，一律改凭纱布外销公司的印签。各厂商与前纺织品外销委员会所订合约未了事项，仍可向纱布外销公司接洽办理。
    【又讯】本市解放前经营纱布等特种货品外销的厂商，根据纱布外销管理暂行办法，须将其出口所得外汇进口原料与机件办理必要手续，如此种进口责任尚未履行，或结汇手续尚未清理者应于本月底以前，往华东区国外贸易管理局登记，听候核办。
