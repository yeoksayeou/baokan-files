Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 1st: TASS, Moscow, July 31st: A North Korean youth delegation, led by Yong Seok (transliteration), Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the North Korean Democratic Youth League, has arrived in Moscow and will proceed to Budapest to attend the World Youth Congress. Yong Seok, in an interview with a reporter from the Youth League's newspaper "Truth," stated: August 15th is an extraordinary anniversary for North Korea – the fourth anniversary of the Soviet Army's liberation of Korea from 50 years of colonial oppression by Japanese imperialism. Four years is not a long time, but there have been great changes in our country's politics and economy. In the great work of building a new democratic Korea, young people have played an important role. Tens of thousands of young workers are now doing everything they can to fulfill the two-year plan for the restoration and development of North Korea's national economy. Many of them have already completed their two-year production plans. Young people have also achieved great success in agriculture. Last year's harvest exceeded the plan by 513,600 tons. This has never happened during the Japanese rule. But the youth of North Korea are not satisfied with the achievements already made. Our country is not yet unified, and American imperialism and its puppets are still pursuing a policy of enslaving the people on part of our land. South Korea's industry is collapsing day by day. The number of unemployed has exceeded 1.2 million. The price of consumer goods has increased 800 times compared to 1946. The democratic youth of North Korea are actively participating in the national struggle for the unification and independence of our motherland.

    出席世界青年大会
    北鲜代表团抵苏
    【新华社北平一日电】塔斯社莫斯科七月三十一日讯：北朝鲜民主青年联合会中央委员会副委员长容锡（译音）率领的朝鲜青年代表团，已抵达莫斯科，将转道赴布达佩斯参加世界青年大会。容锡在接见青年团真理报记者时谈称：八月十五日是北朝鲜的不平凡的纪念日——苏军从日本帝国主义五十年的殖民地压迫下解放朝鲜的第四周年。四年的时间并不很长，但在我们国家中的政治与经济上却有很大的改变。在建立新民主朝鲜的伟大工作中，青年们起了重要的作用。成千成万的青年工人现正尽一切力量来完成恢复与发展北朝鲜国民经济的两年计划。其中许多人业已完成他们的两年生产计划。青年在农业方面也获得很大的成就。去年的收获量超过计划五十一万三千六百吨。这是日本统治时期从来没有过的。但北朝鲜青年并不满足于已有的成绩。我们的国家还没有统一，美国帝国主义及其傀儡至今仍在我国一部分土地上执行奴役人民大众的政策。南朝鲜的工业正在一天天地瓦解。失业人数已超过一百二十万。消费品的价格较之一九四六年已上涨八百倍。北朝鲜的民主青年正在积极地参加争取我们祖国统一和独立的全国性斗争。
