Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 26th: The Huazhong Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee and the Wuhan Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee jointly issued a written statement on the 23rd, severely condemning the White Paper issued by the US State Department. The statement stated: The workers of Huazhong and Wuhan have a glorious history and rich experience in the struggle against imperialist aggression and interference. One example is that the working class once used its own strength to take back the imperialist concessions in Wuhan. We know how to deal with the US imperialist White Paper's extreme slander, shameless intimidation, and conspiracy against the Chinese people. The US imperialist White Paper also vainly attempts to sow discord between the traditional friendship of China and the Soviet Union; this calculation is also wrong. The working class of Huazhong and Wuhan remembers very clearly that the Soviet Union was the first to help the Chinese people fight for independence and against imperialism. Soviet aid was one of the important factors in the victory of the Chinese people in the early stage of the Great Revolution. In the early stage of the Anti-Japanese War, the Soviet volunteer air force personnel were the first to bravely fight against Japanese planes in the skies over Wuhan, defending the people of Wuhan. Finally, it was also with the assistance of the Soviet Red Army that we won the final victory of the Anti-Japanese War. History has proven like iron that the Soviet Union is our friend, and US imperialism is our enemy. We must unite with our friend the Soviet Union to oppose our common enemy.

　　华中及汉口总工会筹委会发表声明
  　严斥美帝白皮书
    美帝妄想挑拨中苏两国传统友谊我们一定要和苏联反对共同敌人
    【新华社汉口二十六日电】华中总工会筹委会和武汉市总工会筹委会，二十三日联合发表书面声明，严厉斥责美国务院发表的白皮书。声明略称：华中和武汉的工人弟兄们，在反对帝国主义的侵略和干涉的斗争中有过光荣的历史和丰富的斗争经验。例子之一，就是工人阶级曾经以自己的力量，亲手收回过帝国主义在武汉的租界。美帝在白皮书里对中国人民极端的诬蔑和无耻的恫吓与阴谋，我们是知道应当怎样来对付的。美帝白皮书，还妄想挑拨中苏两国的传统友谊，这一算盘又打错了。我们华中武汉的工人阶级，记得很清楚，最先帮助中国人民争取独立和反对帝国主义的是苏联，苏联的援助是中国人民在大革命初期取得胜利的重要因素之一。在抗日初期，在武汉上空，最先和日机英勇作战，保卫我们武汉人民的，是苏联的志愿空军人员。最后也是在苏联红军的援助下，我们才取得抗日战争的最后胜利。历史象铁一样的证明了，苏联是我们的朋友，美帝国主义则是我们的敌人，我们一定要和我们的朋友苏联来反对我们共同的敌人。
