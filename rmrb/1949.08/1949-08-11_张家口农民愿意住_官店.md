Sales of raw opium were 196 blocks and 6 packets. 1,375 packs of matches, 103 jin of red and white sugar, 31 bars of soap, and 88 straw hats were sold. The station sold 117 bolts of foreign cloth and 1,835 bolts of native cloth on consignment. It brokered the sale of 480 bolts of native cloth, 34 shovels, 27 hoes, and 96 iron pots on consignment. It brokered the sale of 6 livestock and 200 pigs on consignment. In addition to warmly receiving the farmers who stay there and introducing market information and urban knowledge, the station, whether it sells its own goods, sells on consignment, or brokers sales, maintains extremely fair prices, without any bad practices of deceiving farmers or merchants. Therefore, it has won the praise of the farmers who stay there. Now farmers from various counties in Chahar Province are willing to stay in "Government Inns" (their name for the reception station).
