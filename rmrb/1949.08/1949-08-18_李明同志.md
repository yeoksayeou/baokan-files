　　Comrade Li Ming
    Wang Rong
    Comrade Li Ming, the attending physician of the Second Unit of the 48th Army Field Hospital, takes care of the sick and wounded day and night with all his heart. He is careful and kind in his diagnoses, often touching the heads of the sick and wounded, comforting them and saying, "It's alright, rest for a couple more days and you'll be fine, drink more boiled water!" The patients are very willing to be close to him, and the patients he treats also recover quickly. Therefore, the sick and wounded of the Second Unit gave him a nickname: "Saving Star."
    When he goes to diagnose patients, he often misses his meals. When people urge him, he says "No hurry." The nurses are so moved that no one wants to go to eat first. Last September, during the march into Guan, he always rushed to carry burdens for those with weak physical strength, or carried things for sick comrades. One nurse said to me, "Don't look at how thin and weak he is, and he also has nearsightedness, but when he works, he has great energy!"
    In addition to working diligently for the sick and wounded, he never relaxes in working for the masses in his spare time. Whenever villagers in the驻地are sick, he always patiently diagnoses and treats them. If the medicines are not too expensive, he always tries to give them away; if it's expensive medicine, or the unit doesn't have a lot in storage, he lets the villagers buy it themselves in the city, but he will explain in detail the reasons why he cannot give it to them. Therefore, the relationship between the residents and the Second Unit is very good. Five or six of us sick and wounded live in the home of an old lady in her sixties, who is so busy that she still gets up in the middle of the night to bring boiled water. The sick and wounded are so moved that they feel bad. The old lady says, "Hey! That's nothing, I've never seen such a good team as you, and I've never seen a doctor like Dr. Li. You've helped us a lot!"
    In March of this year, Comrade Li Ming fell ill with a fever of thirty-nine degrees, but he didn't say a word and still勉力 supported himself to diagnose the sick and wounded, until the nurses noticed that his face and movements were different from usual, and they forced him to lie down to rest. "Dr. Li is sick!" This news quickly spread throughout the unit and the village. The sick and wounded wrote letters to him, or personally went to his bedside to慰问, and the villagers also came to visit one after another. The concern and enthusiasm of the masses moved Comrade Li Ming even more, and also educated the other working comrades of the Second Unit. Comrades who previously had unstable work emotions in the unit are now stable, and comrades who were arrogant and uncaring towards the sick and wounded now automatically get up in the middle of the night to see patients. The comrades' attitude towards Comrade Li Ming is full of trust and love.
    Comrade Li Ming's loyalty to his work and his deep love for the sick and wounded are also reflected in his noble spirit of self-sacrifice. For example, in January of this year, Comrade Liu Zhongwu, a soldier of the 427th Regiment of the 143rd Division, was injured by special agents while performing duties. When he was sent to the unit for diagnosis, he could not undergo surgery because he had lost too much blood. Comrade Li Ming unhesitatingly transfused his own blood to him. The higher authorities learned of this and promptly commended him, and also gave him a subsidy so that he could buy some meat for nutrition, but he bought the money into nutritious food and gave it to Comrade Liu Zhongwu.
    The nurses' respect and love for Comrade Li Ming is also because Comrade Li Ming is able to seize opportunities to educate them on medical common sense. For example, when 通州 discovered that special agents had put poison in sesame candy, he tried to get the sesame candy to the unit for testing, and gathered the nurses to explain it. When the poisonous substance was found to be mercuric chloride, he told them about the characteristics of mercuric chloride, the testing methods, and the phenomena of the poisonous substance. After work every day, he also takes time to teach the nurses. During diagnosis, he tries to let the nurses perform the diagnosis first, report the results of the diagnosis, and then he will check it. If there are any errors, he will correct them immediately. This vivid teaching method of bringing apprentices greatly inspired the nurses' enthusiasm for research and learning, and their interest in their work. The nurses in the unit all said, "Working with Dr. Li, you can really learn a lot."
    Comrade Li Ming's leading comrades said to me, "Comrade Li Ming has very high mass faith." Such praise has weight. However, when I was talking to him in the Second Unit, he shyly smiled and said, "I'm really not as good as others say!"
    He has just recovered from his illness and his physical strength has not fully recovered, but he has started working again. When the news of his recovery came from the wards of the sick and wounded, some of the sick and wounded said, "Comrade Li Ming is well, we can do better!"
    The nurses also said, "We must learn from him!"
    Comrade Li Ming is just one of the countless medical workers in our liberated areas. I believe that only under the leadership, cultivation and education of the Chinese Communist Party can he become such a doctor who serves the people.

　　李明同志
    王戎
    四十八军野战医院第二所的主治医生李明同志，他日日夜夜全心全意的照顾伤病员，诊断时既细心又和气，时常摸着伤病员的头，安慰他们说：“不要紧，多休息两天就会好的，多喝开水呵啊！”病人非常愿意亲近他，他所治疗的病人也就好的快。因此，二所的伤病员给他起个称号，叫做“救命星”。
    他给病人去诊断，经常把饭耽误掉，人家催他，他就说“不忙”，看护们都感动得谁也不愿意先去吃饭。去年九月在进关的行军途中，他总抢着替体力弱的挑担子，或者给生病的同志背东西，一个看护对我说：“别看他身体那样瘦弱，又是个近视眼，可是工作起来，劲头可大着哪！”
    除了勤勤恳恳的为伤病员工作外，在空闲的时候，就一点也不放松地为群众工作，凡是驻地村民生病，他总是耐心的给他们诊治。如果是药品不太贵重的话，总想办法送给他们；要是贵重的药，或者是所里储存量不太多的时候，就让村民们自己进城买，但他会详细解释不能给他们的原因。所以驻地居民与二所的关系非常好，我们五六个伤病员住在一个六十多岁的老大娘家里，忙的老大娘半夜还起来送开水，伤病员们都被感动得过意不去，老大娘说：“嗨！那算啥，我从来就没有看见过你们这么好的队伍，也没见过象李大夫那样的大夫，你们给俺们帮的忙还少啦？”
    今年三月里，李明同志得了病，发烧到三十九度，但他一声不响，还勉力支持着给伤病员诊断，直到看护们从他的脸上和动作中发现和平常不一样时，才强要他躺在床上去休息。“李医生病啦！”这消息很快传遍了全所和全村，伤病员们给他写信，或亲自到他床边慰问，村民们也陆陆续续来探望。群众的关心和热情，更感动了李明同志，也教育了二所其他的工作同志。先前所里工作情绪不稳的同志，现在也稳定了，对伤病员态度骄傲不关心的同志，现在也自动半夜起床看病人了。同志们对李明同志的态度充满了信赖与敬爱。
    李明同志的忠实于工作，与挚爱伤病员，还表现在他那种崇高的自我牺牲的精神上。譬如今年一月，一四三师四二七团战士刘忠武同志，在执行勤务的时候，被特务炸伤了，送到所里诊断，因为流血过多，无法施行手术，李明同志就毫不犹豫地把自己的血输给他。上级知道了这件事，及时进行表扬，还发给他津贴，以便买点肉营养一下，但他把钱买成营养品，又送给刘忠武同志了。
    看护们对李明同志的敬爱，还因为李明同志能够善于抓紧时机，给他们进行医务常识的教育。譬如，通州发现特务在芝麻糖里放毒，他设法把芝麻糖弄到所里去化验，并且把看护们集合起来讲解，当化验出毒质是升汞的时候，他又把升汞的特性以及化验的方法和毒质呈现的现象，告诉他们。每天工作完毕，他还抽时间给看护们上课，诊断时，尽量先让看护执行诊断，报告诊断的结果，然后他再进行检查，如有错误，马上纠正。这种带徒弟的活生生的教学方法，大大启发了看护们普遍的研究与学习的热情和工作的兴趣，所里的看护都说：“跟李医生在一块工作，真能学到不少东西。”
    李明同志的领导同志对我说：“李明同志的群众信仰非常高。”这样的称赞是有斤两的。但是，当我在二所和他谈话的时候，他却羞怯地笑着说：“我实在没有别人说的那样好！”
    他病刚好，体力还没有完全恢复，又开始工作了，在伤病员的病房中，传来他病好的消息时，就有伤病员说：“李明同志好啦，咱们可更有办法啦！”
    护士们也都说：“我们一定要向他看齐！”
    李明同志不过是我们解放区无数医务工作同志们中的一个，我相信也只有在中国共产党的领导、培养与教育中，才可能成为这样为人民群众服务的医生。
