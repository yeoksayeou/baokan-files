    Reporting on Industrial Production
    Should Not Pursue Superficial Figures
    Northeast Daily Published Short Commentary
    [This Newspaper Dispatches] The Northeast Daily, regarding the majority of coal mines in the region neglecting precise economic calculations and displaying serious waste in production, published a short commentary entitled "Do Not Be Satisfied with Superficial Figures." Besides pointing out the harm that this kind of careless work style in production management causes to the production undertaking, and reminding everyone to pay attention to correcting it, it also connected this to the fact that in the reporting on industrial production by newspaper editors and reporters, many only pursue superficial production figures. There is a lack of in-depth analysis of the entire production process from raw materials to finished products, failing to measure the local situation within the overall picture, and failing to compare the historical background with the present. Therefore, some reports have become one-sided and created false figures. The commentary pointed out that this is certainly also due to news workers lacking practical knowledge and experience in industrial production, but more importantly, they have not combined the labor enthusiasm of the working masses with the thinking of economic management. In industrial production reports, only emphasizing administrative management and neglecting the reflection of the working class's initiative and creativity is a serious error in reporting. However, if only simply reflecting mass activities while abandoning the many detailed and complex issues of industrial management itself, it will create another kind of bias.

    报导工业生产
    不应追求表面数字
    东北日报发表短论
    【本报讯】东北日报对该地区大多数煤矿在生产中忽视精确的经济计算及严重的浪费现象，曾以“不要满足于表面数字”为题发表短评，除指出在生产管理中此种粗枝大叶的作风对生产事业的为害，及提醒大家注意纠正外，并联系到报纸编辑、记者在对工业生产的报导中，有不少只追求生产的表面数字，对整个生产过程从原料到成品缺乏深入的分析，没有把局部的情况放在全盘中来衡量，没有把历史背景与现在对比，因此就形成了有些报导的片面性，出现了假象的数字。评论指出，这固然也由于新闻工作者对工业生产缺乏实际知识与经验，但更重要的是没有把工人群众的劳动热忱与经济管理的思想结合起来。在工业生产报导中只强调行政管理，忽视工人阶级的积极性与创造性的反映，在报导中是严重的错误，但如果只单纯的反映群众活动，而抛开工业管理本身许多细致而复杂的问题，则将产生另一种偏向。
