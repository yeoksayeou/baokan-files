　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 26th: Tass, Pyongyang, August 25th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, South Korean guerrillas have achieved new victories. The Jeolla South Province guerrillas received support from the Huashan coal miners. Recently, the guerrillas in the Huashan area launched an offensive against the Syngman Rhee police. The battles in this area began on August 17th. The guerrillas cut off telephone communication between Huashan and Guandu, and launched several attacks on the police district. In two days, with the assistance of the miners, they defeated the so-called "reinforcements" in three areas near Huashan. The guerrillas destroyed the railway leading to the Huashan area. A large guerrilla force is currently operating in the Xiaobai Mountain area. The railway from Danlan in North Chungcheong Province to Yangdu in North Gyeongsang Province passes through this mountain.
