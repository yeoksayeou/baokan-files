Representatives from twelve countries, totaling one hundred and one people, are participating, including eighteen each from Britain, France, and Italy, eight from Turkey, six each from Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands, and Sweden, four each from Denmark, Ireland, and Norway, and three from Luxembourg. Among them are notorious reactionaries such as Britain's Churchill, France's Reynaud, and Belgium's Spaak. Spaak has been elected as the chairman of the first meeting of the "European Parliament." The "European Parliament" is a component of the so-called "Council of Europe," instigated and organized by the US-UK bloc. Its other component, the "Committee of Foreign Ministers," has been holding meetings in the same location since August 8th. During the gathering of the "Committee of Foreign Ministers," the internal rules and agenda of the "European Parliament" were discussed, and suggestions were made for the "European Parliament's" agenda. During this discussion, disputes arose between the reactionaries of the major powers and the reactionaries of the small countries regarding the scope of "speaking rights" in the "Parliament." According to the United Press, "The small countries proposed a broad agenda, and Ireland and Sweden even suggested giving the small countries more say on issues on the agenda, but all were rejected."
