    From ape to human, and from primitive human to modern human, the only force upon which development has relied in these millions of years is: the group.
    Primitive behemoths such as the saber-toothed tiger, mammoth, and dinosaur were originally overlords among animals, but not even bone scraps remain of them, precisely because these beasts did not rely on the power of the group, but acted alone, resulting in solitary existence and solitary demise, disappearing without a trace.
    Apes and the humans evolved from apes, on the other hand, have always lived in groups. Even today, gorillas and chimpanzees in Africa, and monkeys in Mount Emei in Sichuan, still live in groups. Initially, it was because apes or humans could not live in isolation; whoever left the group would be harmed by other animals or killed by the cold. Even if they survived these two calamities, the food obtained by individual labor would not be enough to feed themselves.
    After apes became humans, they further developed the power of the group: living and sleeping together, going out and coming in together, drinking and eating together, using the power of the group to compensate for the lack of wisdom, and using the power of the group to solve the difficulties of lacking tools or having inferior tools. The book "How Man Became Giant" depicts the story of primitive people defeating mammoths that were more than ten times larger and dozens of times more ferocious, fully demonstrating the power of the group: "People chased mammoths with the entire tribe. Not a single hunting gun, but dozens of hunting guns stabbed into its hairy flanks. The crowd chased mammoths like a multi-armed and multi-legged creature." Finally, the mammoth was driven into a quagmire by people using fire and could not move, resulting in it being killed by the people. But more difficult was how to drag the mammoth to the cave in the mountains. "Here, it was not two hands working, but dozens of hands. People patiently used pointed stones to chop, cut, and saw the mammoth's thick skin, tough tendons, and strong muscles... Finally, the body was cut into pieces, and people dragged them to their residence in the mountains."
    This kind of group life cultivated the virtue of people loving labor. Whoever was lazy would be ridiculed by everyone. People at that time had no selfish ideas; tools, grain... belonged to everyone, and even individuals belonged to everyone. There were no individual heroes or great men at that time, only the great masses. The masses created wealth, created history, and promoted human progress.
    However, when the masses were immersed in creating wealth and improving human tools, and there was a surplus of products, on the basis of this "surplus," something contrary to the "group"—"private"—had the opportunity to grow.
    Initially, private property consisted of tools and weapons, which was entirely for the convenience of production and defense against wild beasts, and did not hinder the development of the group. Therefore, in the "Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," this kind of "private ownership" is specifically excluded. However, as human production progressed and wealth increased, the possibility of developing private ownership became greater. First, those who sought enjoyment and loved beauty did not hand over what they considered beautiful bones, stones, clothing... to the public, but used them to decorate themselves. Later, due to the division of labor, livestock and land could also be privately owned, which expanded the scope of private ownership and established the concept of private ownership. At this time, exchange had already occurred, and there were already battles between tribes. Those who controlled exchange and commanded battles used their social power to occupy more wealth, and later also occupied captives. This broke the scene of great harmony, and fundamentally divided mankind into two kinds of people—oppressors and the oppressed. From then on, mankind constantly engaged in struggle. This is what Marx and Engels said: since the collapse of primitive communist society, the history of human society has been a history of class struggle.
    After the group was destroyed by private ownership, the exploiting and oppressing classes constantly developed the private side, and the rulers of all ages were extremely selfish and self-interested. The exploited and oppressed classes, on the other hand, developed the group side, the collective side. The palaces of Rome, the pyramids of Egypt, and the Great Wall of China were all created by the power of the slave group. The Spartacus revolt (ancient Greece), the German "Schluchsee Uprising" (i.e., the peasant revolution), the Razin peasant uprising (Russia), and several peasant movements in Chinese history were all attempts to use the power of the group to overthrow the private. Although each time they failed, they educated the oppressed of later generations—making them more aware of the importance of group power. After Marx and Engels synthesized the situations of the oppressed throughout history, especially the then-oppressed proletariat, they created the great "Communist Manifesto," loudly proposing "Workers of all countries, unite!" Only then did mankind, under the leadership of the proletariat and its party—the Communist Party—gradually unite and step by step achieve victory, fight against the private, and advance mankind to a higher level of the world of great harmony. Lenin said: "Living, creative socialism is the power of the masses themselves." The "Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" says: "The history of social development is also...the history of the working masses." These two sentences are very worthy of being remembered by those who study the history of social development.

    群
    ——学习社会发展史杂记
    王评
    从猿到人和从原始人到现代人，在这几百万年的过程中所赖以发展的唯一力量是：群。
    原始时的巨兽如刀齿虎、猛犸、恐龙等，本来是动物中的霸王，但连骨头渣都没有留下来，就是因为这些兽不是依赖群的力量，而是独来独往，结果弄得独存独亡，无影无踪。
    猿及由猿变成的人，则是始终过着群的生活，一直到今天，非洲的大猩猩和黑猩猩、四川峨嵋山里的猿猴，仍然是群居的。最初，是因为猿或人不能离群索居，谁如离开了队伍，谁就会被其他动物伤害，或者被寒冷杀死；即使躲过两重劫难，独个儿的劳动所获得的食物，也无法养活自己。
    猿变成人后，更进一步发挥了群的力量，群起群卧、群出群进、群饮群食、用群的力量补知慧之不足，用群的力量解决缺乏工具或者工具低劣的困难。“人怎样变成巨人”一书中，描写原始人战胜比他们大十几倍、凶恶几十倍的猛犸的故事，充分显示了群的力量：“人们以整个部落去追逐猛犸。不是一根猎枪，而是几十根猎枪戳进它的毛葺葺的胁部。人群象多手多脚的生物一样去追逐猛犸。”最后，猛犸被人用火攻的办法赶进泥淖里动弹不得，结果被人们杀死；但更困难的是如何把猛犸拖到山上的洞穴中去，“这里又不是两只手做工，而是几十只手，人们用尖头的石头耐心的把猛犸的厚皮、硬腱、强筋，砍着、切着、锯着，……最后把身体切成一块一块的，人们再把它们拖到山上的住所。”
    这种群居生活，培养了人们爱劳动的美德，谁如果偷懒，全体人都会耻笑他。那时的人，没有丝毫自私观念，工具、粮食……是大家的，连个人也是大家的。那时没有什么个人英雄、伟人，只有伟大的群众，是群众创造着财富，创造着历史，推动着人类前进。
    但是，当群众在埋头创造财富、改善了人类的工具，生产品有了剩余的时候，就在“剩余”基础上，与“群”相反的一种东西——“私”，就有了生长的机会了。
    开始时候的私有物是工具兼武器，那完全是为了生产和防卸野兽的方便，并没有妨碍群的发展，所以在“联共（布）党史简明教程”中，特别把这种“私有”不算。可是，人类的生产越进步，财富越多，发展私有的可能越大，首先是那些图享受、爱漂亮的人，把自己认为美好的骨头、石头、衣着……不交给公家，而用来装饰自己。以后，由于分工，牲口、土地也可以私有了，这就扩大了私有的范围，确立了私有的观念。在这时，交换已发生了，部落间已有了打仗的情形，那些掌握交换，指挥打仗的人，就利用自己的社会权力，占有了更多的财富，后来又占有了俘虏。这就打破了大同景象，使人类基本上分成两种人—压迫者、被压迫者。自此以后，人类便经常起斗争，这就是马克思和恩格斯说的：自原始共产社会崩溃之时起，人类社会的历史，就是一部阶级斗争的历史了。
    群被私破坏了后，剥削、压迫阶级不断发挥了私的一面，历来的统治者都是极端自私自利者；而被剥削、被压迫阶级则发挥了群的一面、集体的一面。罗马的宫殿，埃及的金字塔，中国的万里长城，都是奴隶群的力量造成的；斯巴达的暴动（古希腊），德国的“舍克里亚”（即农民革命），拉辛的农民起义（俄国），中国历史上若干次农民运动，都是意图用群的力量去推翻私的，虽然每次都失败了，却教育了后代的被压迫者——更明白了群力的重要。当马克思、恩格斯综合了历来被压迫者尤其是当时被压迫的无产阶级的情况后，创造出伟大的“共产党宣言”，响亮的提出了“一切国度底无产者，联合起来啊！”人类这才在无产阶级及其政党——共产党的领导下，逐渐团结起来，并且一步一步的取得胜利，与私作战，把人类推进更高一级的大同世界。列宁说：“生动的、创造的社会主义，就是人民群众自己的力量。”“联共（布）党史简明教程”中说：“社会发展底历史，同时也就是……劳动群众底历史。”这两句话是很值得学习社会发展史底人牢记的。
