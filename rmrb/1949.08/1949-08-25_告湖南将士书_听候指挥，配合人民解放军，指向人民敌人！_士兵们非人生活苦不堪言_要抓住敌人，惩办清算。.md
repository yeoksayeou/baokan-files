A Message to the Soldiers of Hunan

Obey Commands, Cooperate with the People's Liberation Army, and Point Your Weapons at the People's Enemies!
Soldiers' Inhuman Lives are Miserable Beyond Words
Seize the Enemy, Punish and Liquidate Them.

On the same day, Mr. Cheng also published a message to all soldiers in the province, stating: "We defended the freedom and independence of the Chinese nation, preventing it from perishing. We once bravely and enthusiastically shed blood for the War of Resistance. The hardships and sacrifices of the eight-year War of Resistance were worthwhile, purposeful, and meaningful. After the victory in 1945, for whom were we armed? For whose benefit were we fighting a civil war? Are our thoughts and actions contradictory? Are we sinking and floating in a sea of suffering, living a life of self-inflicted pain, of any value? What are our ideological guidelines? What should be our course of action? Soldiers, let us all honestly analyze, examine, reflect, recognize the truth, and determine the direction, replacing hesitation with decisiveness, expressing our determination with action, and moving towards the path we should take, resolutely doing what we should do. Today, there is no room for weakness or doubt; the time has come. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of the Chinese Kuomintang, founded the Three Principles of the People in response to the environment the Chinese nation was in, the inherent shortcomings of Chinese society, and the crisis of imperialism destroying China. The declaration of the First National Congress and the decisions of the Three Great Policies are sufficient to represent the revolutionary spirit of the early Northern Expedition. However, due to the personal desires of the dictator Chiang Kai-shek and the feudal consciousness of the new warlords, they abandoned Dr. Sun's principles, from false revolution to non-revolution, from non-revolution to counter-revolution, and finally surrendered to imperialism, not hesitating to suck the blood of the people, slaughter innocent compatriots, feed bureaucratic politicians, and utilize comprador capitalists, using fascist, cruel, and inhuman means to cultivate his corrupt, incompetent, and traitorous reactionary government, driving millions of armed compatriots to sacrifice for the benefit of himself and a group of accomplices. They have long deviated from the position of the Three Principles of the People, lost the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, they are anti-Three Principles of the People, they are traitors. We must oppose this group of anti-Three Principles of the People, we must eliminate this group of traitors, we must quickly move into the people's camp, follow the direction indicated by the new democracy with the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, based on the correct line of Dr. Sun's Three Great Policies, move forward courageously, avenge the people, and fight for peace. Soldiers! Recognize that the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique and the feudal warlord group wear a mask of hypocrisy. Understand their essence, and shatter their distorted theories and conspiracies. If we still blindly fight for the remaining government of the reactionaries, that is suicide. If we know that supporting the remaining government of the reactionaries is suicide, we must immediately jump out of the valley of death and turn to a new life, not take the path of suicide and murder, deny everything of the reactionary government, establish the belief in new democracy, follow the vast people's armed forces, jointly attack the enemies of the people, lay the cornerstone of peace for a new society, fight for the people, and make contributions to the sacred liberation of the Chinese people. The reactionaries representing the interests of imperialism, the comprador class, bureaucratic capital, and wealthy families, together with the feudal exploiting Gui clique, have oppressed, plundered, and harmed the people for twenty years. How many brothers and sisters who have suffered hardships and humiliations are eagerly hoping that we will bravely and fearlessly drive out this group of demons. Soldiers, why do we ourselves and the majority of good people suffer from the injustice of poverty? Who put us in a situation where economic vitality is cut off, parents and wives cannot be cared for, and ourselves cannot be protected? The heads of the reactionaries have astonishing wealth and lead extravagant and dissolute lives. And our, especially the soldiers', inhuman lives are miserable beyond words. This pain is given to us by the reactionaries. We must seize this group of enemies, punish and liquidate them, and completely destroy them. Chiang Kai-shek and the Gui clique's reactionary and traitorous government are running dogs of the imperialists. Their collusion with the fierce and despicable phenomena of the imperialists is even more sinister than Yuan Shikai's crimes of betraying the country. Soldiers! If our concepts of independence and freedom still exist, if we still have some human self-respect and sense of justice, we must vow to overthrow this shameless, reactionary, and traitorous government that colludes with imperialists and creates a third world war, and pursue the progress of human society and world peace. In terms of the common and consistent demands of the Chinese people, and in terms of the wishes of the world's people who love peace and progress, the task of the liberation of the Chinese people is urgent and sacred. Soldiers! We are about to take action immediately. From today onwards, we have become the people's armed forces, we, this armed force belonging to the people themselves, are now going to point our weapons at the enemies of the people. At this time, I specifically give four instructions, which all my brave and wise subordinates should immediately and conscientiously follow: (1) Resolutely oppose autocratic dictatorship, resolutely oppose feudal forces, and resolutely oppose American imperial capitalism. (2) Resolutely support peaceful proposals and oppose all instigation conspiracies. (3) Obey commands and cooperate with the Chinese People's Liberation Army. (4) Stand on the position of the people, strictly abide by discipline, and never violate the interests of the people.

　　告湖南将士书
  　听候指挥，配合人民解放军，指向人民敌人！
    士兵们非人生活苦不堪言
  　要抓住敌人，惩办清算。
    同日程氏又发表告全省将士书称：“我们保卫中华民族的自由独立，免于灭亡，我们曾经勇敢的热烈的为抗战而流血。八年抗战的吃苦和牺牲，是值得的，是有目的有意义的。一九四五年的胜利以后，我们是为谁而武装，我们是为谁的利益而内战，我们的思想和行动是不是矛盾？我们在苦海浮沉，自苦苦人的生活，有没有价值？我们的思想准则是什么？我们的行动方针应该怎样？将士们，我们大家坦白地分析、检讨、反省、认识真理、判明方向，以果断代替犹豫，以行动表现决心，朝我们应当走的路走，选择我们应当干的坚决的干。今天不容许再怯弱，再怀疑，已经是时候了。中国国民党总理孙中山先生，所创三民主义是针对中华民族所处环境，中国社会先天的缺点，和帝国主义灭亡中国的危机而立论的。第一次全国代表大会宣言和三大政策的决定，都足以代表北伐初期的革命精神。但是由于独裁者蒋介石个人的私欲，和新军阀的封建意识，背弃了孙先生的主张，由假革命到不革命，由不革命到反革命，终于向帝国主义投降，不惜吸吮人民的血液，屠杀无辜的同胞，饲养官僚政客，利用买办财阀，以法西斯残酷无人性的手段，培育他的贪污无能的卖国反动政府，驱使几百万武装同胞，为他个人和一群帮凶们的利益而牺牲。他们早已离开了三民主义的立场，丧失了三民主义的精神，他们是反三民主义者，他们是叛徒。我们要反对这班反三民主义者，我们要消灭这班叛徒，我们要赶快地走到人民阵营里，顺着具有三民主义精神的新民主主义所指引的方向，本着孙先生三大政策的正确路线，勇往直前，为人民复仇，为和平而战斗。将士们！要认清蒋介石反动派和封建集团的军阀，戴的是假冒为善的面具。明白他们的本质，粉碎他们的歪曲理论和阴谋。如若我们还要盲目地为反动派的残余政府而战，那即是自杀。如若我们知道了拥护反动派残余政府是自杀，我们要马上跳出死亡之谷，改向新生，不要走那自杀杀人之路，否认反动派政府的一切，树立新民主主义的信念，跟着广大的人民武装，一同讨伐人民之敌，替新社会奠和平的基石，为人民大众而斗争，为神圣的中国人民解放而立功。代表帝国主义、买办阶级、官僚资本豪门家族利益的反动派，同封建剥削的桂系集团，二十年来欺压掠夺，残害人民。多少饱尝苦难和凌辱的兄弟姐妹们，热望着我们奋勇无畏地驱逐这群恶魔。将士们，我们自己本身和大多数善良的人民，何以现遭不平均的穷困的生活之罪？谁使我们陷入一个经济生机断绝，父母妻子不能顾，本身不能保的境地？反动派的头子们，财富惊人，骄奢淫佚。而我们、尤其是士兵的非人生活，苦不堪言。这种痛苦，是反动派给我们的。我们要抓住这批敌人，惩办清算，彻底毁了他们。蒋介石和桂系反动卖国的政府，是帝国主义者的走狗，他们勾结帝国主义者的凶恶下流的现象，比袁世凯卖国的罪行还要凶。将士们！若是我们独立自由的观念还存在，若是我们还有些许人类自尊心和正义感，我们誓必要打倒这厚颜无耻勾结帝国主义者、制造第三次世界大战的反动卖国的政府，追求人类社会的进步与世界和平。就中国人共同一致的要求言，就世界人类爱好和平进步的愿望言，中国人民解放的任务，是迫切的，是神圣的。将士们！我们马上就要行动了。从今天起，我们已成为人民的武力，我们这属于人民自己的武力，现在要指向人民的敌人。在这个时候，我具体指示四项，凡我勇敢智慧的部属，立即切实遵照：（一）坚决反对专制独裁，坚决反对封建势力，坚决反对美帝国资本主义。（二）坚决拥护和平主张，反对一切挑拨阴谋。（三）听候指挥，与中国人民解放军配合行动。（四）站在人民的立场，严格遵守纪律，绝不违背人民的利益。
