Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station Broadcast: The private Zhongjian Machinery Ironworks, with the efforts of all workers and engineers to improve technology, has completed the largest boiler produced domestically in Shanghai. Its lifespan is expected to be thirty years, and it saves 5% to 10% more coal than old-fashioned, horizontal boilers. Other fuels such as cottonseed cake and sawdust can also be substituted. This demonstrates that the technology of our country's workers and engineers has made great progress, and it is also a good answer to the imperialist blockade policy. Also: Seamen of the Fishery Department of the China Aquatic Products Company, in order to reduce the company's expenses, are automatically repairing ships. Starting on July 30th, deck department personnel also voluntarily participated. According to preliminary estimates, this year, due to thorough hands-on repairs, each ship can save more than one million to two million yuan. It is estimated that the repair of eighteen fishing vessels this year can save about 20 million yuan. The seamen all happily said: This time we can break the all-time record of the Aquatic Products Company.

　　沪私营中建机器厂
  　完成最大锅炉一部
  　使用年龄可达三十年
    【上海人民广播电台广播】私营中建机器铁工厂，在全厂工人、工程师努力改进技术之下，完成本市国产品中最大的锅炉一部。使用年龄可达三十年，较老式、卧式锅炉用煤节省百分之五至十，其他燃料如棉籽饼、木屑等均能代用。表现我国工人及工程师的技术，已有很大进步，亦是对帝国主义者封锁政策的一个很好回答。又：中华水产公司渔务处海员，为减少公司开支，海员自动修船。于七月三十日开始，甲板部人员亦自动参加，据初步估计，今年由于彻底动手修理，每一条船即可节省一百余万元至两百万元。预计十八条渔轮，在今年之修理中，即可节省二千余万元左右。海员们都高兴的说：这次我们可以打破水产公司有史以来的纪录了。
