Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, August 21st: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army's Third Field Army, which liberated Fuzhou this time, traversed the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangxi, overcame various difficulties of lofty mountains and scorching heat and torrential rains, and successfully carried out the task of marching thousands of miles. Before departure, all units carefully studied the possible difficulties encountered in the march and the methods to overcome them, and made full ideological and organizational preparations. Many people's meritorious workers and hero models have formulated plans to make meritorious service during the march. In early July, the unit set off in the scorching heat. The soldiers carried full equipment and food, with each person carrying as much as fifty pounds, but still often advanced bravely at a speed of ten to fifteen miles per hour. The large army was divided into dozens of arrowheads, crossed the Xianxia and Wuyi Mountains, which stretched for more than 800 miles along the border of Fujian and Jiangxi, crossed peaks of 800 to 1,500 meters, and entered Fujian. When passing through the main peak of the Wuyi Mountains, the mountain road was rugged and difficult to travel. The artillerymen disregarded their fatigue and unloaded the heavy artillery from their horses, carrying the gun bodies themselves and traveling arduously on the steep and narrow mountain road. Many soldiers broke their knees or accidentally fell into deep ravines; but they ignored the pain, climbed up, gritted their teeth, and caught up with the ranks again. When a certain unit crossed the mountains, they camped on uninhabited mountain slopes, eating only two meals of white rice a day, and drinking salt water as a dish. When a certain unit braved the scorching heat of 98 degrees Fahrenheit to cross the Wuyi Mountains, some soldiers fainted from the scorching sun. After being rescued, they scrambled to carry ammunition forward. The soldiers' clothes were soaked with sweat, and they took them off, wrung them dry, and put them on again to walk. During the long march, the engineering battalion of a certain unit, regardless of fatigue and difficulties, built 26 bridges destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit army and repaired more than 360 miles of highways, enabling the artillery and baggage units to advance quickly and smoothly. When the Third Company of the battalion rebuilt the Chishi Bridge in Chong'an, Fujian, the soldiers jumped into the deep and swift currents, binding stakes and driving wood, and completed a large bridge capable of carrying five tons on schedule. During the march, each unit set up propaganda stations along the way, showing shadow plays and telling clapper tales, and the soldiers marched forward all the way cheering and singing.

　　冒酷暑暴雨越崇山峻岭
    千里进军福建
  　第三野战军某部胜利完成进军任务
    【新华社福建前线二十一日电】此次解放福州的人民解放军第三野战军某部，跋＠浙江、江西两省，克服了崇山峻岭与酷暑暴雨的各种困难，胜利地执行千里进军的任务。在出发前，各部都详细地研究了在进军中可能遇到的困难和克服的办法，作了充分的思想准备和组织准备。许多人民功臣、英雄模范都订出了进军的立功计划。七月初旬，该部即冒盛暑出发，战士们背负着全副装备和粮食，每人负重达五十斤，但仍经常以每小时十里至十五里的速度奋勇前进。大军分成了数十支箭头，越过闽赣边界绵延八百余里的仙霞、武夷两大山脉，翻越八百公尺至一千五百公尺的高峰，进入福建。在通过武夷山脉主峰时，山路崎岖难行，炮兵们不顾疲劳，将重炮从马上卸下，自己抬着炮身，在陡狭的山道上艰难地行进。不少战士跌破膝盖或失足掉下深涧；但他们都不顾疼痛，爬起来咬着牙关，又赶上行列。某部翻越山岭时，露宿在荒无人烟的山坡上，每天只吃两餐白饭，冲盐水当菜。某部冒华氏九十八度的酷暑翻越武夷山岭时，有些战士被烈日晒晕倒地，经救醒后又争着扛起弹药前进。战士们的衣服被汗水浸透了，脱下来拧干了又穿着走。某部工兵营，在长途行军中，不顾疲劳困难，修筑了被国民党匪军破坏的桥梁二十六座，修补公路三百六十余里，使炮兵、辎重部队迅速顺利前进。该营三连在福建崇安重建赤石大桥时，战士们跳下水深没顶的急流中，缚桩打木，按期完成了一座能载重五吨的大桥。各部在行军中，沿途设立了鼓动站，拉洋片，说快板，战士们都一路欢呼高歌前进。
