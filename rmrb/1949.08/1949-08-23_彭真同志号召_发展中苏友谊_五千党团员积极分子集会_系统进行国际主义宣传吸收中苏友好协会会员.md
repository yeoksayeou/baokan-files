　　Comrade Peng Zhen Calls for
  　Developing Sino-Soviet Friendship
    Five Thousand Party Members, League Members, and Activists Gather
    Systematic Internationalist Propaganda Conducted; Members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Recruited
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The CCP’s (Chinese Communist Party) Beijing Municipal Committee convened a meeting at 7:00 PM on the 21st at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall, gathering over five thousand Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists from factories, schools, and government organizations. Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Municipal Committee, delivered a report on Sino-Soviet issues. He called on all Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists in the city to conduct more systematic internationalist and Sino-Soviet friendship propaganda among the masses, thoroughly eliminating the lingering influence of the anti-Soviet propaganda of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and to develop the organizational work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association among the masses. In his report, he first explained that the Chinese revolution is part of the world revolution, that the Chinese, Soviets, and working people of all countries are one family, and that their common and greatest enemy is imperialism. Next, he explained that the Chinese revolution would not have been so successful without Soviet assistance and the assistance of international revolutionary forces, and that China's revolutionary ranks are inseparable from the world revolutionary ranks. The Chinese Communist Party grew up under the leadership and support of the great Lenin and Stalin. The Soviet Union is our teacher, and the Soviet path is our path. Despite the constant provocations and slanderous anti-propaganda by imperialism and its running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries, the people of China and the Soviet Union have established a deep friendship in the long revolutionary struggle. He then specifically explained how to crush and eliminate the enemy's various anti-Soviet propaganda, and to further consolidate and develop Sino-Soviet friendly relations and communication of Sino-Soviet culture through the organizational strength of the masses. Develop membership of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in factories, schools, and government organizations, and expand the organization of Sino-Soviet friendship. He pointed out that among the working masses, it is important to emphasize that workers all over the world are one family, and that the Soviet Union is the world's first workers' state, that is, a socialist country; among intellectuals, it is important to emphasize, from the perspectives of revolution and counter-revolution, from the laws of social development and the inevitability of historical development, that the world is bound to move towards socialism and communism, that the Soviet Union is the beacon of mankind, and that the whole world is bound to follow the Soviet path, as well as to crush the various provocative anti-propaganda of the counter-revolutionaries. After the meeting, a Soviet film was shown, and factories, schools, and government organizations immediately launched a membership signing campaign.

　　彭真同志号召

    五千党团员积极分子集会
    系统进行国际主义宣传吸收中苏友好协会会员
    【本报讯】中共北平市委会于二十一日下午七时，召集各工厂、学校、机关中的共产党员、青年团员和工会、学生会的积极分子共五千余人在中山公园音乐堂开会，由市委书记彭真同志作关于中苏问题的报告。他号召全市的共产党员、青年团员和工会、学生会积极分子在群众中进行更有系统的国际主义和中苏友好的宣传，彻底扫除帝国主义及国民党反动派过去对苏联的反宣传所残留的影响，在群众中开展中苏友好协会的组织工作。在报告中，他首先说明中国革命是世界革命的一部分，中国、苏联和各国劳动人民是一家，他们共同的最大的敌人是帝国主义。接着，他说明中国革命如果没有苏联援助和国际革命力量的援助是不会这样成功的，并说明了中国的革命队伍与世界革命队伍是不可分的，中国共产党是在伟大的列宁、斯大林领导扶持下成长起来的。苏联是我们的老师，苏联的道路，就是我们的道路。尽管帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派在不断的进行挑拨和污蔑性的反宣传，但是中苏两国人民在长期革命斗争中已经建立了深厚的友谊。接着他又具体说明了应该如何粉碎和肃清敌人的各种反苏宣传，用群众的组织力量进一步巩固和发展中苏友好关系和沟通中苏文化。在工厂、学校、机关中发展中苏友好协会的会员，扩大中苏友好的组织。他指出，在工人群众中，要着重说明全世界工人是一家，苏联是世界第一个工人国家即社会主义国家；在知识分子中，要着重从革命、反革命，从社会发展的规律和历史发展的必然性去说明全世界必然要走向社会主义、共产主义的道路，说明苏联是人类的灯塔，全世界都必然要走苏联的道路，以及粉碎反革命的各种挑拨性的反宣传。会后即放映苏联电影，各工厂、学校、机关即展开入会签名运动。
