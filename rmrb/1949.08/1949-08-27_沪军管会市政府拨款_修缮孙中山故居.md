Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 26th: The Shanghai Military Control Commission and the Municipal People's Government have allocated substantial funds to renovate Sun Yat-sen's former residence at 7 Xiangshan Road, Shanghai. After obtaining the consent of Madam Soong Ching-ling last month, the Shanghai Military Control Commission and the Municipal People's Government immediately hired architect Chen Zhi of the well-known Huagai Architectural Firm in the city to meticulously design the project. Subsequently, the entire project was contracted to the Lu Fushun Construction Company, and the renovation work commenced on August 19th. It is expected to be completed within three months. The former residence of Mr. Sun Yat-sen at 7 Xiangshan Road, Shanghai, was never renovated by the Kuomintang reactionaries during their more than twenty years of occupation in Shanghai. They allowed it to corrode and deteriorate, with the roof riddled with holes, the walls collapsing, and the books and furniture inside severely damaged.

　　沪军管会市政府拨款
  　修缮孙中山故居
    【新华社上海二十六日电】上海军管会及市人民政府已拨出巨款修建沪市香山路七号孙中山先生故居。沪市军管会及人民政府在上月征得孙夫人宋庆龄之同意后，当即聘请本市有名的华盖建筑事务所陈植建筑师精心设计，随由陆福顺营造厂承包全部工程，修建工程已于八月十九日开始。预计三个月内可以完工。按沪市香山路七号孙中山先生故居，国民党反动派在其盘踞上海二十多年间从不加以修缮，任其腐蚀损坏，屋顶洞穿，四壁偏塌，屋内藏书及家具等已损坏不堪。
