Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd: TASS, New York, 31st:  After traveling through the industrial cities of New England (northeastern United States) and studying the economic situation in the region, the famous American reporter, Gate, broadcast his observations from the trip. Gate described the lives of workers in Connecticut, saying: in industrial Connecticut, one in eight residents is unemployed, and one in four industrial workers has been laid off. Workers' working hours in June were 25% less than in the same month last year. People have once again fallen into the fear they experienced in the 1930s. Every department store is running advertisements for large-scale clearance sales of inventory. In Bridgeport, department store sales fell 16% compared to last year. The General Electric factory in the city, which once employed 13,000 people in the post-war period, now has half the number of workers. Gate visited the local employment office in Bridgeport, whose mission is to help unemployed workers find jobs. In front of the office was a long line of unemployed people, mainly veterans and young workers. In the past, the employment office was able to find jobs for about 1,800 workers per month, 60% of whom went to work in factories. Currently, the employment office can only find jobs for an average of 900 people per month, only 10% of whom go into factories. Black people are the first to be laid off. Of the 13,000 workers employed by the General Electric factory in the city last year, 1,500 were black, now only 40 black people remain. The situation in Waterbury, Connecticut is even worse. This is an industrial center for the manufacture of clocks and watches, with a population of over 100,000. The four major companies in Waterbury used to employ 25,000 workers, now three out of every five workers have been laid off. Gate described his visits to various towns, saying: Workers in various places complained about the harsh working conditions. These conditions are caused by capitalists to increase profits. In Providence, Rhode Island, and New Bedford, Massachusetts, workers are complaining everywhere. In Rhode Island, 25% of unemployed workers are unable to receive unemployment benefits. The largest factory manufacturing machine lathes, Brown & Sharpe Company, used to employ over 12,000 workers, now it only employs 4,000 workers. New Bedford, which is considered the center of the textile industry, has 15,000 unemployed workers. Those workers who still have jobs are complaining about the deteriorating working conditions.

    美记者广播美东北经济观感
    失业恐惧笼罩全境
    工业发达的康涅狄格州八人中有一人失业
    【新华社北平二日电】塔斯社纽约三十一日讯：美国著名记者盖特在旅行新英格兰各州（美东北部）的工业城市并研究该地区的经济状况之后，广播他旅行的观感。盖特叙述康涅狄格的工人生活称：在工业发达的康涅狄格州每八个居民中有一人失业，每四个产业工人中有一人被解雇。工人在六月份的工作时间比去年同月减少了百分之二十五。人民再度陷入他们在三十年代曾经体验过的恐惧中。每一个百货公司都登大减价出清存货的广告。在布利治朴特，百货公司的销售量比去年下降了百分之十六。该城通用电气公司的工厂，战后一个时期中曾雇用一万三千人，而现在工人的数目减了一半。盖特在布利治朴特访问了该地的就业所，该所的任务是帮助失业工人寻找职业的。在该所门前排列着一长列的失业者，其中主要是退伍军人和青年工人。在以前，该就业所每月大约能够替一千八百名工人找到职业，其中百分之六十进工厂工作。就业所在目前每月平均只能替九百人找到工作，其中只有百分之十进入工厂工作。黑人是最先被解雇的。该城通用电气公司工厂去年雇用的一万三千工人中，有一千五百名是黑人，现在只剩下四十名黑人。康涅狄格州华特堡的情况更糟。这里是制造钟表的工业中心，居民超出十万人。华特堡的四大公司在以前雇用二万五千名工人，现在每五个工人中就有三名被解雇，盖特叙述他在各市镇的访问称：各地工人对工作环境的恶劣，皆抱怨言。这些环境是因资本家为增加利润而造成的。在罗得岛州的普罗维顿斯及马萨诸塞州的新白福特，工人皆怨声载道。在罗得岛州有百分之二十五的失业工人不能领到失业救济金。白朗与萨柏公司制造机器车床的最大工厂，以前曾雇用一万二千工人以上，现在只雇用四千工人。被认为是纺织业中心的新白福特，有一万五千工人失业。那些仍有工作的工人，对日益恶化的工作环境都有怨言。
