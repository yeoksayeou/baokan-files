    ▲ In order to let the students have fun together before the end of the academy, and to make the Youth League members and students more united, bringing the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship in the academy back to school, the Southwest District of the Youth League has scheduled a Youth League Day for this afternoon (16th) at 4:00 PM in the auditorium of the Teachers College Affiliated High School. Students are warmly welcomed to participate, and League members are invited to invite surrounding students to participate. The conference content includes dinner, a party, and reports from newly admitted League members on their feelings about entering the academy and their motivations for joining the League, and will be a very pleasant and meaningful day.
    ▲ The students of the Southwest District Academy have discovered many deeds of Youth League members taking the lead in helping students in work, study, and life after more than a month of academy life. As a result, they have a further understanding of the Youth League and its members. Recently, they listened to "Introduction to the Youth League" and Comrade Helu's answers regarding the relationship between joining the League, studying, and family. The groups also discussed the League Charter and launched students' criticisms of the League. As of the 14th, more than 200 students have applied to join the League.
