Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, August 8th: The Central Plains Provisional People's Government and the CCP Central China Bureau jointly issued emergency instructions on flood control, water management, production, and disaster relief on July 25th, pointing out that in areas along rivers and riverbanks prone to breaches and in areas already affected by disasters, flood control, water management, production, and disaster relief should be the current urgent tasks. Currently, the affected population in Hubei alone will reach nearly three million. The Xuchang District in Henan, the Poyang District in Jiangxi, the Nanchang District, and the Jiujiang District have also been affected by disasters. The floods are even more severe in Hunan and Guangdong-Guangxi provinces, which are about to be liberated. Although the Central China Bureau and the People's Government have carried out disaster relief and water management work and have achieved initial results, the autumn flood season has not yet passed. If the areas along the rivers and riverbanks do not promptly engage in emergency rescue and flood prevention, there is still a risk of the disaster expanding.

Regarding flood prevention and emergency rescue, the instructions pointed out: Areas along rivers and riverbanks should use all their strength to conduct emergency rescue, blocking breaches and repairing and reinforcing dikes, ensuring that dangerous dikes are raised and thickened to be higher than the flood water level. At the same time, the masses should be organized to carry out drainage, save seedlings, and rescue fields, ensuring that flooded fields are drained. To this end, it is necessary to increase the masses' confidence in flood prevention and emergency rescue a hundredfold, give play to the masses' initiative and creativity, combine scientific technology with the masses' experience, and make good use of all water management and flood prevention agencies and technical personnel. Unified command, with responsibility divided by sections; delineate flood prevention zones and specify flood prevention priorities; establish a system of mutual coordination and cooperation, overcome departmentalism; formulate flood control and water management covenants and disciplines, and mobilize the masses to supervise each other. Those who are perfunctory, neglect their duties, and fail to rescue effectively, resulting in breaches and disasters, should be punished accordingly. Those who have made outstanding achievements in emergency rescue and water management should be rewarded accordingly.

Regarding relief work in areas that have already been affected by disasters, the instructions pointed out: Under the principle of "production for disaster relief" and "production for self-relief," emergency relief and resettlement of disaster victims should be carried out. Party and government workers should rush to the disaster areas to conduct condolences, investigations, and propaganda to overcome the pessimistic and despondent mood of the disaster victims. In severely affected areas, the government can issue some emergency relief grain to alleviate current difficulties. However, the main thing is to immediately help the masses engage in various productions, such as spinning cotton, weaving cloth, fishing, chopping firewood, reclaiming wasteland, and transportation. At the same time, it is necessary to actively drain water to restore fields and prepare to replant late autumn crops. Various localities can implement work-for-relief programs, use charity warehouses, promote social mutual assistance, and encourage relatives, fellow villagers, friends, and neighbors to help each other to solve the disaster victims' production fund difficulties. Under extremely difficult conditions, it is also possible to borrow a certain amount of disaster relief grain from landlords and rich peasants in a guided, orderly, and procedural manner, with borrowing and repayment. However, it is necessary to prevent random borrowing and coercion, and especially not to force middle peasants to provide grain, and it is necessary to strictly prevent reactionary elements from taking advantage of the disaster to create chaos. For disaster victims who are severely affected and unable to survive locally, a portion can be evacuated to bumper harvest areas (in principle, they should be resettled in the original county if possible), but special personnel should be responsible for organizing. Disaster victims should be educated on "self-reliance" and "labor production, thrift to overcome famine," while non-disaster area masses should be educated on "sharing weal and woe," so that the people in disaster areas and non-disaster areas can "unite to overcome famine." All party, government, and military organs in the region must vigorously carry out a movement of streamlining and economizing, saving food and clothing to overcome the famine together with the disaster victims. In severely affected areas, this year's burden can be reduced or exempted according to the actual situation.

The instructions emphasized that the key to the success or failure of disaster relief and water management lies in whether the masses can be fully mobilized and rely on the organized strength of the masses to overcome difficulties and carry out struggles. It is necessary to overcome the masses' pessimistic thinking of leaving things to fate and establish the fighting will that collective wisdom and efforts can overcome nature. Local governments should stipulate a simple and easy-to-implement law on the reasonable sharing of water conservancy funds, and after detailed discussions at representative meetings of all sectors in districts and villages, mobilize the masses to conscientiously implement it, in order to promote the masses' enthusiasm and creativity and overcome difficulties with all their strength. The system of per capita apportionment must be broken. At the same time, attention must be paid to mobilizing broad social forces to carry out flood prevention and disaster relief work. All local democrats, enthusiastic and helpful enlightened gentry, technical personnel with rich water management experience, and local intellectuals should be absorbed to participate and work together. For the old Baojia personnel, reward and punishment measures should be promulgated to urge them to perform meritorious service for the people in disaster relief and water management.

The instructions pointed out that flood prevention and disaster relief should be combined with the struggle to suppress bandits and counter special agents. It is necessary to explain to the people that the occurrence of water and drought disasters is the result of the Kuomintang reactionaries' heinous rule. In the past, they openly stole national wealth, exploited farmers, and disregarded water management and flood prevention. Now they are organizing bandits, ambushing special agents, carrying out disturbances, looting, instigating, and sabotaging in an attempt to expand the disaster. Therefore, it is necessary to call on the masses, in order to protect flood prevention and disaster relief, to cooperate with the troops and the government to carry out the struggle to suppress bandits, counter special agents, and counter conspiracies of sabotage. It must be made clear to cadres and the broad masses in various localities that, under the conditions of the new liberated areas, if this struggle is neglected or relaxed, it will be difficult, if not almost impossible, to complete the task of flood prevention and disaster relief.

The instructions finally pointed out that flood control and water management should be regarded as a long-term struggle task, and it is by no means possible to solve all problems with just one shock. All areas along the rivers and riverbanks and areas that have already been affected by disasters should establish flood control, water management, and disaster relief committees, under the unified leadership of the government and the Party, to carry out this work in a planned, checked, and supervised manner. After entering the newly recovered areas, troops and staff should immediately pay attention to leading the masses in water management, flood prevention, bandit suppression, and disaster relief. After this year's flood season, governments at all levels should conduct investigations, summarize flood prevention experiences, and formulate future water management plans.

    中原临时人民政府、中共中央华中局紧急指示
    防汛治水生产救灾
    水旱天灾是国民党反动派万恶统治的结果
    【新华社汉口八日电】中原临时人民政府暨中共中央华中局于七月二十五日联合颁发关于防汛治水、生产救灾的紧急指示，指出在沿江沿河堤岸易决口地区和已成灾地区，应将防汛治水、生产救灾作为目前紧急任务。目前仅湖北遭灾人口就将及三百万，河南许昌分区、江西鄱阳分区、南昌分区、九江分区也相继受灾，正将解放的湖南及粤桂两省，水灾更为严重。华中局和人民政府虽已进行救灾治水工作，并已取得初步成绩，但现在秋汛未过，沿江沿河地区如不及早抢险防汛，灾情仍有扩大危险。
    关于防汛抢险，指示指出：沿江沿河地区应以全力抢险、堵决、修堵圩堤，务使险堤增高增厚，高于洪水水位。同时应组织群众进行排水、救禾、救田，务使被淹田地出水。为此，必须百倍提高群众防汛抢险的信心，发挥群众积极性和创造性；结合科学技术与群众经验，善于使用治水防汛的一切机构与技术人材；统一指挥，分段负责；划定防汛区，规定防汛重点；建立相互协同配合的制度，克服本位思想；订立防汛治水公约和纪律，发动群众互相督促。对于敷衍塞责，抢险不力，以致溃决成灾者，要分别予以惩处。对抢险治水有卓越成绩者，要分别予以奖励。
    关于业已成灾地区的救济工作，指示指出：要在“生产救灾”和“生产自救”的方针下，进行急救和安置灾民。党政工作人员，应急赴灾区，进行慰问调查，进行宣传，克服灾民悲观失望的情绪。受灾严重地区，政府可发放一部急赈粮，解救当前困难。但主要的是应该立即帮助群众从事各种生产，如纺花，织布，打鱼，砍柴，开荒，运输等等。同时，应积极排水复田，准备补种晚秋。各地可实行以工代赈，动用义仓，推行社会互济，提倡同族、同村、亲友、邻居、互相接济，以解决灾民生产资金的困难。在十分困难的条件下，还可有领导、有秩序、有手续，有借有还地向地主富农借一定数目的救灾粮。但要防止乱借、乱逼，尤不得强制中农出粮，并应严防反动分子利用灾情制造混乱。对受灾严重而在本地无法维生的灾民，可向丰收地区疏散一部分（原则上应在原县安置为好），但要派专人负责组织。对灾民则应进行“自力更生”、“劳动生产，节约渡荒”的教育，对非灾区群众则应进行“患难共济”的教育，使灾区与非灾区人民能“团结渡荒”。全区党政军各机关人员要厉行精简节约运动，节衣缩食和灾民共渡灾荒。在受灾严重地区，可根据实际情况，减少或豁免今年负担。
    指示着重指出：救灾治水的成败关键，在于能否充分动员群众，并依靠群众组织起来的力量，去克服困难，进行斗争。必须克服群众听天由命的悲观思想，树立群策群力可以胜天的斗争意志。各地政府应规定一个简明易行的防水工款合理负担法令，并经过区村召开各界代表会详加讨论，发动群众认真执行，以便发扬群众的积极性和创造性，全力克服困难。按人均摊的制度必须打破。同时，必须注意动员广泛的社会力量来进行防水救灾工作。举凡地方民主人士，热心服务的开明士绅，富有治水经验的技术人材，和本地知识分子，皆应吸收他们参加，共同努力。对于旧的保甲人员，应颁布奖惩办法，促其从救灾治水中为人民立功。
    指示指出：防汛救灾应和剿匪反特斗争结合起来。必须向人民说明，水旱天灾的酿成，是国民党反动派万恶统治的结果。在过去他们公开的盗劫国家财富，压榨农民，不顾治水防汛。现在他们更组织土匪、埋伏特务、进行扰乱、抢劫、挑拨、破坏、企图扩大灾荒。因此，必须号召群众，为保卫防水救灾，应协同部队与政府，开展剿匪、反特、反阴谋破坏的斗争。必须使各地干部和广大人民了解，在新区条件下，忽略了或放松了这一斗争，要完成防水救灾的任务，不但是困难的，而且几乎是不可能的。
    指示最后指出：防汛治水，应该作为一个长期的斗争任务，决不是突击一次就可以解决全部问题的。凡沿江沿河地区和业已成灾地区，皆应成立防汛治水救灾委员会，在政府与党的统一领导下，有计划、有检查、有督促地来进行这一工作。在进入新收复区后，部队和工作人员，应即时注意领导群众治水防汛和剿匪救灾。在今年汛期过后，各级政府，应进行调查，总结防汛经验，订出今后治水计划。
