　　[This Municipality's News] After the victorious conclusion of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Beiping Municipality, representatives of worker, farmer, youth, women, and student organizations in Beiping Municipality, who attended the conference, held meetings in their respective units or adopted other methods to promptly convey the various resolutions of the representative conference, implementing the spirit of the conference among the masses. Some groups also discussed the various resolutions of the conference, studied how to cooperate with the government in implementing the resolutions, and assisted the government in promoting various tasks. Yesterday (the 18th), representatives from worker, farmer, youth, women, student and government organizations in Beiping Municipality spoke to reporters about their impressions of the conference and how they had conveyed the conference afterwards. Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said: This conference of people from all walks of life enabled people from all walks of life, especially worker representatives, not only to listen to the reports of the government's various work over the past six months, but also to fully express their opinions and put forward many constructive proposals. Among them, everyone agreed with the resolutions that were established, and those that were not agreed with were debated. Some were rejected, and some were unanimously agreed upon and submitted to the government for execution. At this conference, worker representatives truly felt like masters of their own affairs. During the short few days of the conference, Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission Zhou Enlai, and Chairman of the North China People's Government Dong Biwu all came to the venue to speak, which made the workers feel especially excited and happy, and received very clear instructions. Therefore, after participating in the conference, I am convinced that the spirit and resolutions of the conference can be conveyed to all the workers in the factories, unite the city's workers, actively produce, and complete the glorious task of building a people's capital with all the people in the city. In the future, I hope that such democratic meetings can be held regularly, at certain stages of work, to review, summarize, and plan together with the people and the government, so that the work of building a new Beiping can be completed more quickly, and I hope that this kind of democratic meeting can gradually develop and improve, becoming the People's Congress, the highest authority of the people. Li Shumin, a worker representative from the Beiping Clothing Third Factory, said, "If there was no Communist Party, how could I have participated in such a conference?" When she saw Chairman Mao, she was so moved that she didn't know what to do. Although she didn't take notes, every word Chairman Mao said was firmly remembered in her mind. Su Rui, director of the trade union and worker representative from the Beiping Clothing Factory, said: I saw Chairman Mao twice at the "July 1st" and "July 7th" conferences, but I didn't see him as clearly as this time. I believe that Chairman Mao's reading of the letter written by the citizen in his speech and soliciting the opinions of the representatives, letting everyone come up with ideas and solutions, fully demonstrated the spirit of democracy. Gan Jixian, a worker representative from the 70th Arsenal, said: Because the working class is now the master of the house, the words in my heart have to be turned out. Whatever I have in my heart, I will say it all. Chairman Mao's speech is just like our family members, sincere, frank, and kind, and he also asks us to come up with solutions. It's really good. Representatives from the Beiping Postal Bureau, the First Branch of the Beiping Machinery Factory, and the Beiping Branch of the North China Electric Power Company also reported the resolutions and spirit of the All-Circles Representative Conference at the general staff meeting or the staff executive committee after the 15th. Yuan Zhi, a representative of the construction industry workers, Zhang Chun, a representative of the textile and dyeing industry workers, and Zhao Yuxiang, a female worker representative of the match industry workers, all agreed that this conference fully demonstrated the spirit of democracy. People spoke without any reservations, knowing everything and saying everything. From this conference, the workers truly felt that they were the masters of their own affairs. Regarding Chairman Mao's speech at the meeting and taking out a letter from a citizen to discuss with everyone, the people's leader's democratic demeanor and concern for the people's lives were too touching. Zhao Yuxiang said that the person who wrote the letter was wrong to blame the government for the high taxes in the letter. After liberation, the types of taxes were less than before, as was the case with the match factory. It is wrong to think that after liberation, one should not pay taxes or pay very little taxes. Where does the money come from for the people's government to do things for the people without the people paying taxes? I listened to the government leaders' work reports for the past six months and did so many things for the people to eliminate special agents and bandits, and to restore and develop production... Only more than 50 million catties of millet were used. If this expense is not borne by our people, who should bear it? The two worker representatives, Zhang Chun and Zhao Yuhou, both expressed that they would convene a factory-wide workers' meeting in a day or two to convey the resolutions and spirit of the conference, calling on everyone to streamline and save, report special agents and bandits, and step up production.

    Farmer Representatives Unanimously Express Determination to Organize Farmers to Implement Resolutions

    The 30-member delegation of farmers from the suburbs of Beiping Municipality held a discussion on the second day after the closing of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles to study how to implement the spirit of the All-Circles Representative Conference in the rural areas of the suburbs. All the farmer representatives unanimously believed that the country is the people's country, and the people must be their own masters. All affairs of the country must be discussed by the people themselves. Now the government reports its work to the people, accepts criticism, and is very different from the Kuomintang's practice of training the people at meetings. Farmers' Association representatives Chai Zemin, Su Min, Shi Dehai and others said: Everyone should not only understand the basic principles and tasks of Beiping's work, but also assist the government in doing it. At present, eliminating special agents, stabilizing social order, developing production, and reporting profiteers are all tasks that require everyone to do together. Chai Zemin, a representative of the Farmers' Association, said, "Every representative should bring the democratic spirit of the conference back to the countryside!" Everyone unanimously decided: After returning to the countryside, convene meetings by district or village to convey the spirit, and ensure that wherever they go, they will promote the spirit and embody the spirit of the conference in their work.

    Women's Representatives Hold Discussions to Organize Women to Strengthen Production

    Women's representatives Zhang Xiaomei, Yang Yunyu, Liu Qingyang, Pu Jiexiu, Chen Wenrun, Shen Cuizhen, Liang Keping, Hu Yizai, Han Huilian, and Yu Ruqi held a forum the day after the closing of the meeting to discuss how to convey the spirit of the meeting. Han Huilian of the Tsinghua Family Women's Association said: "After the meeting, I felt that there was a very important task on my shoulders, which was how to convey the spirit of the meeting. Now I plan to convey it widely in the school with other representatives from Tsinghua University. This conference really achieved democracy and unity. Everyone was unconstrained and very harmonious. Chairman Mao's speech was like a family member." Zhang Xiaomei, director of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Women's Federation, said: "A total of 42 women representatives participated in this conference, which is fundamentally different from the fact that only a very small number of one or two women representatives in the parliament of the Kuomintang reactionaries were there as decorations in the past. In the future, we will also mobilize women from all walks of life to participate in political activities. We should strengthen the unity and organization of women from all aspects. We can convene female workers and female students to convey the spirit of the meeting in a planned way." Pu Jiexiu, general manager of Xinghua Enterprise Company, said: After attending the representative meeting, I felt that the industrial sector has a heavy responsibility. In the future, we should find ways to study how to develop production, open up sales channels, and persuade speculators to stop speculating. I plan to convene several forums to discuss production and sales issues. What I felt at the meeting was the unity of people from all walks of life. In the future, we women should unite working women. Liu Qingyang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Beiping Branch of the All-China Women's Federation, believes that this conference has achieved the unity of people from all walks of life and fully demonstrated the spirit of democracy. In the future, the government and the people can be more closely connected. She suggested that the government should strengthen its leadership in developing production, and the government should also pay attention to the production of women's handicrafts. Yang Yunyu, a representative of the Municipal Women's Federation, said: "We must not only convey the spirit of the meeting, but also organize the masses to turn the resolutions and spirit of the meeting into practical actions." Chen Wenlan, general secretary of the Beiping YWCA, said: "I was very moved after hearing Chairman Mao's words asking everyone to come up with ideas. Chairman Mao is so obedient to the people's opinions! I feel that my responsibility is very heavy, especially to improve the political awareness of female youth members." She suggested that the women's sector should first achieve streamlining and thrift.

    Xu Liqun Asks Communist Youth League Members to Assist the Government in Overcoming Difficulties

    Xu Liqun, director of the Preparatory Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of Beiping, said: I learned many new things at this People's Representative Conference of All Circles. I saw how the government concentrated the opinions of the people and turned the government's policies into everyone's own. I saw the new democratic forms of the people and how many unreasonable and formalistic things of the old bourgeois democracy were abandoned. Chairman Mao came to the meeting and sincerely submitted the difficult issues to the conference, which made our representatives feel that the burden was very heavy. We must work better in the future because we all have the responsibility to solve the difficulties, and the Communist Youth League should become the Communist Party and the democratic government's assistant in solving the difficulties. Xiao Song, a representative of the Beiping Municipal Democratic Youth League, said: "The spirit of democratic unity was fully demonstrated in this conference. The questions in each representative's mind were raised quickly and happily, such as the issue of eliminating the remaining counter-revolutionaries, the issue of prices, etc. For these questions, each representative freely exercised their right to speak. The meeting made resolutions on the questions raised one by one. If it could be done, the government would do it immediately. If it should be postponed, it would be submitted to the government for consideration and postponement. If it could not be done or should not be done, it would be simply rejected at the meeting. This is also a manifestation of the responsible attitude of the meeting." She also explained the significance of the conference unanimously passing the resolution to initiate the establishment of the preparatory committee of the Beiping Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, pointing out that the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association depends on the strength of workers and students. The youth of Beiping have a revolutionary tradition and should work together to promote the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

    Gu Qizong, a representative of the Beiping Municipal Student Federation, said: When I saw Chairman Mao at the conference, I was even more filled with the determination and confidence to serve the people and build a new China. Chairman Mao shared with us a letter written to him by a citizen and asked us to solve the three questions raised by that citizen. We deeply felt the people's leader's concern for the people. At this conference, our student representatives raised three questions about tuition fees, scholarships, and reform of the education system, all of which were resolved reasonably. Now the reform of the education system is underway, the government has formulated measures for scholarships for the next semester, and reasonable solutions have been found for tuition fees, which is really worthy of our special thanks. After six days of meetings, our students thoroughly realized that the government is the people's own government, and also realized not only that we are the masters of the country, but also how we should be the masters. We found that in the past we did not pay enough attention to the work of the government, and sometimes we were not satisfied, and sometimes we did not think that we ourselves should assist the government in doing it. For example, when we saw the silver dealers selling silver dollars, we at most felt that they were annoying, and we did not think of stopping them. Now we understand that if we want to be the masters of the country, we must personally build our own country and the people's capital.

    青联代表萧松说
  　要靠工人学生力量建立中苏友好协会
    学联代表要求同学
  　关心政府工作协助政府工作
    【本市讯】北平市各界代表会议胜利闭幕后，出席会议的北平市工、农、青、妇、学等团体代表纷纷在其所属单位开会，或采取其他方式，及时传达了代表会议的各项决议，把大会的精神贯彻到群众中去，有的团体还讨论了大会的各项决议，研究怎样配合政府执行决议，并协助政府推动各项工作。昨天（十八日），北平市工、农、青、妇、学各团体及机关代表，分别对记者谈了他们对会议的感想及会后传达会议的情形。市职工总会筹委会主任萧明说：这次各界代表会使各界人民特别是工人代表不仅听取了半年来政府各项工作的报告，并对今后工作充分发挥意见，提出许多建设性议案，其中，大家对同意的成立了决议，对不同意的，经过争论，有的被否决了，有的得到一致协议，交政府执行。工人代表在这次会上，真正感觉到当家作主。在短短几天的大会上，中国人民领袖毛主席、朱总司令、中国人民革命军事委员会周恩来副主席和华北人民政府董必武主席都亲临会场讲话，工人尤其感觉非常兴奋愉快，得到很明确的指示。因此，在参加大会之后，深信必能把大会精神、决议传达到各工厂全体工人中去，团结全市工人，积极生产，同全市各界人民完成建设人民首都的光荣任务。今后希望能在一定期间，一定工作段落中续开这样的民主会议，使人民和政府一起作检讨，作总结，作计划，使建设新北平的工作完成得更快些，并且希望逐渐使这种民主会议发展、提高，成为人民最高权力机关的人民代表大会。北平被服三分厂工人代表李淑敏说：“如果没有共产党，我怎么能参加这样的大会？”她看见毛主席时，感动得不知怎样才好，虽然没有用笔记一句，可是毛主席讲的每句话都已牢牢地记在脑子里。北平被服厂工人代表工会主任苏瑞说：在“七一”、“七七”大会上看见过两次毛主席，都没有这次看得真。认为毛主席在讲话中念了那封市民写的信，还征求代表意见，让大家出主意、想办法，充分表现了民主的精神。七十兵工厂工人代表甘绩显说：因为工人阶级当家作了主人，心中的话都得翻腾出来，我心里有什么话就都说出来了，毛主席讲话，就好象咱们家里人一样，真诚、坦白、慈祥，而且还让咱们来想办法，真是好。北平邮政局、北平机器厂第一分厂、华北电业公司北平分公司的代表们也分别于十五日以后，在全体职工大会上或职工执委会上，报告各界代表会议的决议和精神。建筑业工人代表袁峙，织染业工人代表张纯，火柴业工人代表女工赵玉香，一致说这次会议充分表现了民主精神，人民说话毫无顾虑，知无不言，言无不尽。从这次会上，工人也真正有了工人当家作主人的感觉。对于毛主席到会讲话还拿出一个市民给他的信让大家讨论，人民领袖民主的风度和对人民生活的关心，太使人感动了。赵玉香说，写那封信的人在信上责备政府税太高是不对的，解放后捐税种类比以前少了，以火柴厂说就是如此。认为解放了就不应纳税或纳极少的税，这种思想是错误的。人民政府给人民办事，不由人民纳税那里来的钱呢？我听了政府首长半年来的工作报告，做了那么多事情，给人民肃清特务匪徒，给人民恢复发展生产……才用了五千多万斤小米，这笔费用不由我们人民负担，应该由谁负担？张纯和赵玉厚二位工人代表都表示，一两天内他们要召开全厂工人会议，传达大会的决议和精神，号召大家精简节约，检举特务匪徒，加紧生产。
    农民代表一致表示组织农民贯彻决议
    北平市郊区农民代表团三十人在各界代表会议闭幕的第二天，举行了座谈会，研讨如何将各界代表会的精神贯彻到郊区农村中去。各农民代表一致认为：国家是人民的国家，人民必须自己当家作主，国家的一切事情都要由人民自己讨论；如今政府向人民报告工作，接受批评，与国民党开会训人民的情形大不相同了。农会代表柴泽民、苏民、施德海等人说：大家不仅要了解北平工作基本方针与任务，而且要协助政府去做，目前肃清特务、安定社会秩序、发展生产、检举奸商等工作都需要大家一齐来做。农会代表柴泽民说：“每个代表应该把大会中的民主精神带回农村去！”大家一致决定：回到农村以后，以区或村为单位召开大会，进行传达，并保证自己走到那里，就到那里宣传，还要在工作中体现大会精神。
    妇女界代表举行座谈　组织妇女加强生产
    妇女界代表张晓梅、杨蕴玉、刘清扬、浦洁修、陈文润、沈翠缜、梁柯平、胡一哉、韩慧莲、于汝琪等十人。在会议闭幕后的第二天，便举行了一个座谈会，讨论如何把大会精神传达下去。清华家庭妇女会韩慧莲说：“开完会后，觉得有个很重要的任务压在身上，那就是怎样把大会精神传达下去，现在我打算和清华大学的其他代表一齐在学校里普遍传达，这次大会真做到了民主团结，大家无拘无束，很是融洽。毛主席的讲话真象一家人一样。”市妇联筹委会主任张晓梅说：“这次参加大会的妇女代表共四十二人，这与过去国民党反动派的议会只有极少数一两个妇女代表作点缀，根本不同。今后我们还要发动各阶层妇女参加政治活动，我们应从各方面加强妇女的团结与组织的工作。我们可以召集女工、女学生，有计划的传达会议精神。”兴华企业公司总经理浦洁修代表说：参加代表会后感到产业界责任重大，今后我们更应设法研究如何发展生产，打开销路，说服投机的人，使他们不再投机，我打算召开几个座谈会，谈谈生产销路问题。我在会议上感到的就是各阶层人民的团结，今后我们妇女界要团结劳动妇女。中国妇女联谊会北平分会常委刘清扬认为这次会议得到了各阶层人民的团结，充分发挥了民主精神。今后政府和人民更可紧密的联系了。她提出政府要加强对发展生产领导，政府对妇女手工业的生产也要注意。市妇联代表杨蕴玉说：“我们不但要把会议精神传达下去，还要组织群众，把大会的决议和精神变成实际行动。”北平女青年会总干事陈文澜说：“我听了毛主席叫大家想办法的话以后，很受感动，毛主席是多么遵从人民的意见啊！我觉得自己责任很重大，尤其是提高女青年会员的政治觉悟一点。”她提出妇女界首先要做到精简节约。
    许立群要求青年团员作政府克服困难助手
    新民主主义青年团北平市筹委会主任许立群说：在这次各界代表会议里，学习了许多新事物。看到了政府怎样集中了人民的意见，并把政府的政策变为大家自己的；看到了新的人民的民主形式，并如何摒弃了许多资产阶级旧民主的不合理与形式主义的东西。毛主席到会，诚恳地把困难问题提交大会，使我们代表们都感到担子很重，今后必须更好地工作，因为我们都负有解决困难的责任，而青年团是应该成为共产党与民主政府解决困难的助手的。北平市民主青联代表萧松说：“这次大会中，充分的表现了民主团结的精神，每个代表肚子里的问题都痛痛快快的提出了，譬如肃清反革命残余问题，物价问题等等。对于这些问题，各个代表又是如此自由的运用了他们的发言权利。会议并对所提问题一个个作了决议，能办的要政府立即就办；应缓办的即交政府斟酌缓办；不能办或者不应办的，在大会上便干脆否决了。这又是大会负责态度的表现。”她并说明大会一致通过由大会发起成立中苏友好协会北平市分会筹委会的意义，指出：中苏友好协会的成立要靠工人和学生的力量。北平青年有着革命的传统，应该一齐来努力推动中苏友好协会的工作。
    北平市学联代表古奇踪说：当我在大会上看到毛主席时，我就更充满了为人民服务建设新中国的决心和信心。毛主席把一个市民写给他的信念给我们听，并要我们解决那位市民所提出的三个问题，我们深深地感到了人民领袖对人民的关怀。这次会上，我们学生代表提出了学费、助学金和改革学制三个问题，都获得了合理的解决。现在改革学制正在进行，政府已订出了下学期助学金的办法，学费已有了合理解决的办法，这实在值得我们特别感谢。经过了六天的会议，我们同学们都彻底认识了政府是人民自己的政府，也认识了不仅我们是国家的主人，而且应该如何去做主人。我们发现过去我们对于政府的工作关心不够，有时还不满意，有时没有想到我们自己应该协助政府去作。譬如我们看到卖银元的银鬼子，顶多觉得他怪讨厌，没有想到去制止他们。现在我们明白了，我们要作国家的主人就必须亲自动手来建设自己的国家和人民的首都。
