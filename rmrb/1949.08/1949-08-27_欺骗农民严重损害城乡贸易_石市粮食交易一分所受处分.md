　　Cheating Farmers Seriously Damages Urban-Rural Trade
  　Shijiazhuang Grain Exchange First Branch Receives Punishment
    [Shijiazhuang News] The First Branch of the Shijiazhuang Grain Exchange has been punished by its superiors for unfair dealings and dishonesty towards farmers. This exchange was originally a private grain store (Xie Xing) and was reorganized in March of this year. Under the leadership of the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the guidance of the Trade Corporation, it played a certain role in the supply of grain to urban residents and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. However, because the staff were mostly from old merchant backgrounds, there were many impure phenomena in their work style. For example, some people liked to take small advantages and manipulate the scales, especially when dealing with farmers, the scales were even more unfair, often giving them less. On one occasion, grain merchants from Jinzhong and Beiping bought more than 4,000 jin of wheat, and Yang Zeyu of the branch manipulated the scales, giving them 37 jin less. They were caught on the spot, and only after an argument was the difference made up. At the same time, the staff of the branch were arrogant and not very friendly to customers. Once, after office hours, a farmer wanted to exchange some grain, but they found it troublesome and refused to do so, only exchanging it the next day. Therefore, the Third District government and the people were not satisfied with their work. Recently, the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the Trade Corporation sent people to inspect and unanimously concluded that this error was quite serious, not only damaging the reputation of state-owned grain stores, but also undermining the relationship between urban and rural trade. The reasons for this are: firstly, the leading organs did not pay close attention, and did not pay attention to reforming and educating the staff's work style, which needs to be reviewed. Secondly, the staff of the factory lacked understanding of the new urban-rural relationship and lacked the spirit of serving the farmers, thus violating economic discipline and engaging in incorrect behavior that harmed others and themselves. In order to learn from the past and avoid future mistakes, the leadership specifically convened a general meeting of all staff to conduct in-depth self-criticism, and gave the person in charge of the branch a reprimand. The employee Yang Zeyu received a demerit.

　　欺骗农民严重损害城乡贸易
  　石市粮食交易一分所受处分
    【石家庄讯】石家庄粮食交易所第一分所，因为做买卖不公道，对农民不老实，受到了上级的处分。这个交易所，早先是一家私人粮店（协兴），今年三月份才改组的。在工商局的领导和贸易公司的指导下，它对市民的粮食供给和城乡的物资交流上，曾经起了一定作用。但由于工作人员，多是旧商人出身，在作风上存在着许多不纯的现象。譬如有些人爱沾小便宜，好耍秤杆，特别是跟农民打交道上，秤更不公道，时常少给人家。有一次，从晋中北平来的粮商，买走麦子四千多斤，该所杨泽玉便玩弄秤杆，少给了三十七斤，当场被人家提出来，吵了一架才给补足。同时，该所工作员态度傲慢，对顾客不大和气。有一次，刚过办公时间，一个农民，要换点粮食，他们便嫌麻烦，硬不给换，等到第二天，才给换走。因此，三区政府和人民都不满意他们的工作。最近，工商局、贸易公司派人下去检查，一致认为这种错误相当严重，不但损害公营粮店的信誉，而且破坏城乡贸易的关系。追究其原因，首先是领导机关抓的不紧，对工作人员的作风未注意改造教育，这是需要检讨的。其次是，该厂工作人员，对新的城乡关系认识不足，为农民服务精神不够，因而违反了经济纪律，做出了损人害己的不正确行为。为了惩前毖后，领导上特召集全所工作人员大会深入检讨，并给予该所负责人以批评处分，职员杨泽玉则记过一次。
