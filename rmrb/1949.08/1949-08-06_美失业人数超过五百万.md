Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 5th: TASS, New York, August 3rd: According to figures from the US Census Bureau, the number of unemployed in the United States reached 4,095,000 in July, an increase of 317,000 from June and an increase of 1,878,000 from July of last year. The bureau's figures greatly underestimate the extent of unemployment in the United States, a fact even the most conservative Commerce Daily admits. Many observers claim that the actual number of total unemployed greatly exceeds five million. News from different industrial regions of the United States all speak of increases in unemployment. An Associated Press reporter from Pittsburgh reported that the number of unemployed in the three states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia has doubled in twelve months. The mayor of Erie, Pennsylvania, said that 10 percent of the city's workers are unemployed. Workers in San Francisco had 10 percent unemployment in June. It is reported that in Rome, the copper industry center in New York State, 20 percent of the workers are unemployed.

    美失业人数
    超过五百万
    【新华社北平五日电】塔斯社纽约三日讯：根据美国人口统计局的数字，美国失业人数七月份达四百零九万五千人，较六月增加三十一万七千人，较去年七月增加一百八十七万八千人。该局的数字大为低估了美国失业的程度，甚至最保守的商务日报也承认这一点。据许多观察家宣称：全部失业的实在人数大大超过五百万。来自美国不同工业地区的消息都谈到失业人数的增加，报联社记者自匹兹堡报道：宾夕法尼亚、俄亥俄和西弗吉尼亚三州的失业人数，十二个月中增加了一倍。宾夕法尼亚州伊瑞市市长说：该市有百分之十的工人失业。旧金山的工人在六月有百分之十失业。据悉，在纽约州的铜工业中心罗姆，有百分之二十的工人失业。
