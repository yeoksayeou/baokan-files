Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th: Public enterprises in Shanghai and other places are adopting various effective measures to overcome the difficulties brought about by the blockade of the Kuomintang bandit gangs instigated by imperialism, and have already achieved results. The East China Telecommunications Administration has replaced the foreign rapid machine circuits between Shanghai and Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Wuhu, and Nanjing and Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Wuhu, Xi'an, and other places with other components. After the improvement, not only has the work not been affected, but also 960 rolls each of oil paper strips and corrugated paper are saved each month, worth nearly one million yuan. Some circuits of the bureau, which originally used large oil engines for power generation, have also been replaced with small oil engines or hand-cranked generators, saving 1,100 gallons of gasoline and engine oil per month. The Public Transportation Company in Shanghai, which consumes the most gasoline daily, is experimenting with using gas and charcoal to replace gasoline; gas-powered vehicles have been successfully tested. Zheng Xingtai Automobile Repair Factory has been massively modifying charcoal gasifiers for customers. Units such as Pudong Local Construction Company, Shanghai Lulianfu Truck Transportation Company, and Shanghai Barge Company are in contact with the factory for modifications. The test results of the modified cars show that their driving efficiency is the same as that of gasoline cars. After more than a month of research, employees of the Rubber Department of the Shanghai Central Chemical Factory have successfully trial-produced fan belts and are now formally producing various automobile fan belts, which have always been dependent on foreign imports. In addition, several enterprises affected by the blockade are being converted with the assistance of the government. Hangzhou State-owned Trading Company has helped the private Tianxing and Minsheng silk factories, whose sales were sluggish due to the obstruction of sea routes, to temporarily switch to cotton weaving. The trading company has signed a yarn-for-cloth exchange contract with the two factories to solve their raw material and sales difficulties.
	[This newspaper report] Shanghai News: In order to further understand the difficulties faced by private enterprises in Shanghai under the blockade of imperialist reactionaries and to solve them in a planned and step-by-step manner, the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China convened a forum of representatives of private industry on July 29. More than 50 representatives attended. The representatives reported and analyzed in detail the general production status, raw materials, sales, labor-capital relations, and capital issues of the current industry. They also provided several suggestions, including industrial loans, foreign exchange, assistance in resolving labor-capital relations, and the establishment of factory-funded wage pre-deposit accounts, for the People's Bank to study. All the speakers were very enthusiastic and prepared production and sales statistics in advance, and submitted written materials to the People's Bank for reference. In addition to pointing out the current difficulties under the enemy's blockade, some entrepreneurs actively provided opinions on breaking through the difficulties, saw the bright future of Chinese national industrialists today, and stated that in the future, they will only work closely with the People's Government and jointly devote themselves to self-reliance and open up the domestic market in order to seek the true future of national industry. Regarding the partial relocation of factories inland, everyone agreed that since the inland has abundant raw materials, it is necessary to first find a way to solve the problem of electric power. Finally, Comrade Xie Shoutian, Deputy Director of the Financial Department, reiterated: It is hoped that people in the industrial sector should broaden their horizons, face the inland, rely on the rich domestic raw materials and the vast market to get rid of economic dependence on imperialism.

    【新华社上海七日电】上海等地各公营企业正采取各种有效的措施，克服因帝国主义策动的国民党匪帮的封锁而带来的困难，并已获得成绩。华东电信管理局已将上海与苏州、镇江、无锡、芜湖，及南京与镇江、无锡、芜湖、西安等地之间，原用外国快机的电路改用其他机件。经改进后，不仅工作未受影响，且每月仅油纸条和波纹纸即各节省九百六十盘，约值近百万元。该局部分电路原用大油机发电者，亦已改用小油机或手摇发电机，每月可节省汽油、机油一千一百加仑。上海每日消费汽油最多的公共交通公司正在试验以煤气、木炭等代替汽油；煤气汽车且已试验成功。郑兴泰汽车修造厂已大量代客改装木炭瓦斯炉。正向该厂接洽改装的有浦东地方建设公司、上海市陆连富卡车运输公司、上海驳船公司等单位。已改装的汽车试验结果，其行驶效力与汽油车相同。上海中央化工厂胶品部职工经月余研究，已试制风扇皮带成功，现已正式生产各种汽车风扇皮带，此类皮带一向依赖国外输入。此外，若干受封锁影响的企业正在政府协助下转业。杭州国营贸易公司已帮助因海道受阻而销路不畅的私营天星、民生两丝绸厂暂时改营棉织。贸易公司已与该两厂订立了以纱换布的交换合同，以解决其原料和销路的困难。
    【本报讯】上海消息：人民银行上海分行为进一步的了解沪市私营企业在帝国主义反动派封锁之下困难状况及有计划有步骤的进行解决，于七月二十九日召集私营工业界代表举行座谈。到会代表五十余人。各代表对当前工业一般生产状况、原料、销路、劳资关系、资金等问题，都详细报告分析。并提供若干建议，包括工贷，押汇，协助解决劳资关系，举办工厂厂方工资预先折实存款等，以供人民银行研究。各发言人都很踊跃，并预先准备了产销上的统计数字，向人民银行递送书面材料以供参考。若干企业家除指出目前在敌人封锁状态下的困难之外，并积极提供打破困难之意见，看到今天中国民族产业家的光明远景，今后唯有与人民政府通力合作，共同致力于自力更生，开拓国内市场，以求民族工业的真正前途。关于部分工厂内迁，由于内地原料丰富，大家甚为赞同，并提出须首先设法解决电动力问题。最后金融处副处长谢寿天同志复着重说明：希望产业界人士应放开眼光，面向内地，依靠国内丰富的原料和广大市场，以摆脱经济上对帝国主义的依赖性。
