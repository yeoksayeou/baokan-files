    Learning from Soviet Young Friends
    Inspiration from the Discussion "What is Heroic Behavior?"
    He Tian
    After reading "What is Heroic Behavior?" published in the People's Daily on July 29th, I gained great inspiration in learning discussion methods.
    The first speaker at the discussion meeting "did not begin with theoretical topics or abstract arguments. He began by narrating things that everyone present knew—how two female students, Natasha Kovshova and Masha Polivanova, sacrificed themselves while fulfilling their duties as soldiers..." Then he asked, "What did they sacrifice their lives for? Why do we call them heroes?" This starts from reality, focusing everyone's thoughts on the topic to be discussed. Finally, the speaker answered the question himself: "Because they believed that the happiness of the masses of people is above all else, above personal happiness, and above their own lives." He expressed his own views on the issue, serving as a catalyst for further discussion.
    Let's look at how they spoke: The first speaker was a girl who said that if a class was about to enter battle, and the first bullet killed the squad leader, the soldiers would be panicked and at a loss. They would prepare to retreat. At this time, I took on the responsibility of the squad leader, shouted "Forward!" and led the soldiers to charge towards the enemy. But if I did this only to obtain a lieutenant's epaulet, only to obtain a higher rank; then can my behavior be called heroic behavior? Therefore, from this example, we can say: what matters is the action, the result of the action; not the emotions felt when completing the action. She used a concrete example to appropriately express her still vague viewpoint. Indeed, in our discussions, few people can do this. We often only use some abstract concepts and nouns, and as a result, we still cannot make others understand our meaning. Speaking specifically not only makes it easier for listeners to understand but also is more vivid and can spark others' interest in speaking. Of course, we cannot cite absurd assumptions that are divorced from reality. That will not only fail to lead to more correct conclusions but will also create many digressions far from the topic, diverting everyone's attention.
    Later, the debate turned to Stakhovich in the "Young Guard." This tells us that in collective discussions, we can use characters in literary works to help illustrate our meaning. Of course, it is best to have a premise that the book has prestige among the masses and is familiar to most people.
    As the discussion progressed, the speeches from various angles converged on the general question: Does behavior motivated by maternal love also count as heroic behavior? Does the self-sacrifice of a heretic based on their own beliefs and ideals also count as heroic behavior? The passage said by Marayev is very important. Although his view of heroes is not correct, his words inspired everyone to think. The discussion went a step further, and it naturally came to a few sentences that seemed like conclusions: "We can only call behavior done for the cause of justice and progress, for the interests of the masses of people, heroic behavior." Therefore, when discussing a problem from many different angles, it is easier to reach a conclusion that is close to the truth. However, in the past, we often stubbornly clung to one point, splitting hairs, and as a result, we did not come to any conclusion, but wasted a lot of time.
    But until Nikolai Ivanovich spoke, everyone had defined the scope of heroic behavior very narrowly, as if every hero had to sacrifice or risk their own life, otherwise, they could not be considered a hero. So, the passage that Nikolai, as the chairman, said was very necessary. It was a turning point, directing everyone's attention to other aspects, making everyone think more broadly and extensively. Then someone mentioned "daily heroic behavior," and then extended it to the connection between heroic behavior and merit. Natasha Kovshova's letter played a big role. It allowed everyone to think calmly. Therefore, the method of collective discussion is not rigid, and there is no fixed formula. We can appropriately use various forms to liven up the atmosphere of the meeting, to induce everyone's thoughts, and to make the discussion results as close as possible to the truth.
    Finally, the literature teacher gave a summary speech. She summarized everyone's scattered opinions and told us: "Not all the problems can be solved at this discussion meeting, but they have already considered these problems--and this is the main thing." She spoke of the basic spirit of the discussion meeting and then ended her speech with such hopes: "I hope that after this discussion meeting, each of you will examine your own thoughts and ask yourselves: What kind of person am I? In order to make my life glorious and valuable, in order to appear strong in the face of any test I encounter in the course of my life, what kind of qualities should I acquire?" Her words are not only addressed to the youth of the Soviet Union, but to us, to the young people of the whole world, and are worthy of serious consideration by each of us.

    向苏联的年青朋友学习
    “什么是英雄行为”中的讨论方式给我的启示
    何田
    七月二十九日人民日报刊载了一篇“什么是英雄行为？”读后，使我在学习讨论方式上，得到很大的启示。
    讨论会的第一个发言人“开始时既不说理论上的主题，也不说抽象的论证。他一开始就述说一些所有出席者谁都知道的事情——两个女同学娜塔莎·柯芙萧娃和玛莎·波里瓦诺娃如何尽了战士的职责而牺牲的事情……”然后就问：“她们到底为了什么而牺牲自己的生命？为什么我们称她们为英雄呢？”这是从实际出发，把大家的思想都集中地引向要讨论的题目。最后演讲者自己回答了这个问题：“因为她们认为人民大众的幸福高于一切，高于个人的幸福，也高于自己的生命。”他把自己对这问题的见解说了出来，起了抛砖引玉的作用。
    我们再看看他们是怎样发言的：说话的第一个是一个少女，她说，假设有一个班正要进入战斗，第一颗子弹就把班长打死了，战士们慌张失措了，他们准备后退，这时我负起了班长的责任，喊声“向前”就领了士兵们冲向敌人。而我这样地做，只是想获得一个少尉的肩章，只是想获得我更高一级的官职；那么能不能把我的行为叫做英雄行为呢？因此，由这一例子就可以说：主要的是行为，是行为的结果；而不是完成这一行为时所怀的情感。她用具体的例子恰当地表达出她还很模糊的观点。是的，我们在讨论时，很少人能做到这一点，往往只是运用一些抽象的概念和名词，结果仍然不能使别人了解你的意思。说得具体，不但使听的人易于了解，而且比较生动，能引起别人发言的兴趣。当然，我们不能例举脱离现实非常荒谬的假设。那非但不能得出比较正确的论断，反而会使本来很简单的问题生出许多枝节的离题很远的小问题，分散了大家的注意力。
    后来争论转到“青年近卫军”中的斯大霍维支身上。这告诉我们在集体讨论时，可以不妨举文艺创作中的人物，来帮助说明自己的意思。当然这最好有一个前提，就是这本书在群众中是有威信的，为大多数人熟知的。
    讨论往前发展着，发言从各个不同的角度归结到这个总的问题上：是不是由母爱推动的行为也算英雄行为？出发于自己的信仰和理想的异教徒的自我牺牲是不是也算英雄行为？马拉也夫所说的那段话是很重要的，虽然他对英雄的看法是不正确的，但是他的话启发大家去思索。讨论是更深入了一步，而且很自然地得出这样结论似的几句话：“为了正义和进步的事业，为了人民大众的利益而完成的行为，我们才能把它叫做英雄行为。”所以多从不同的角度来讨论一个问题时，是比较容易得出接近于真理的论断来的。然而我们以前往往是抓住一点死不放，钻牛角尖，结果讨论不出所以然来，倒还浪费了很多时间。
    可是直到尼古拉·依万诺维支说话以前为止，大家都把英雄行为的范围说得很狭窄，似乎每一个英雄都非得牺牲或冒险自己的生命不可，否则就不能算为英雄。所以作为主席的尼古拉说的那一段话是很必要的。它是一个转捩点，把大家的注意力引向另外的方面，使大家都想得更辽阔、更广泛。于是有人提到“日常的英雄行为”，接着又引申到英雄行为与功劳之间的关联。娜塔莎·柯芙萧娃的信起了很大的作用，它使所有的人都得以冷静思考。所以集体讨论的方式并不是呆板的，并不是有一套固定的公式。我们可以适当地利用各种不同的形式来活泼会场的空气，来诱发大家的思想，使讨论结果尽可能接近于真理。
    最后文学教员作了一个总结性的讲话。她把大家分散的意见综合起来，又告诉我们：“这一讨论会上不能把所有的问题都解决了，然而他们已经把这些问题都加以考虑了——而这正是主要的”。她说出了讨论会的基本精神，然后以一个个这样的希望结束了她的讲话：“我希望在这个讨论会后，你们每一个人都来检查一下自己的思想并且扪心自问：我到底是一个什么样的人？为了要使我的生命活得光荣而又有价值，为了要使我在生命途中所遇到的任何考验的面前显得坚强有力，我应该使自己获得一种什么样的品质？”她的话不仅仅是对着苏联的青年说的，是对着我们说的，是对着全世界的年青人说的，值得我们每一个人认真思考。
