    Soviet Production Cooperative
    Chairman of the Council of the Electric Power Production Cooperative N. Tsereteli

    The Soviet Union has tens of thousands of production cooperatives. Together with state-owned enterprises, they jointly supply the people with industrial products, food, and household goods.

    The production cooperative I serve as Chairman of the Council produces fuses (a fusible metal wire or strip inserted in an electrical circuit to ensure safety—translator's note), electric furnaces, table lamps, switches, and other electrical equipment.

    Five-Year Plan Completed

    Our cooperative was organized in 1929, with only twenty-five members, operating in a small factory. After twenty years of expansion, our cooperative has become a large enterprise with 380 members. We use all the latest factory technology and equipment. Almost all work is mechanized, and we have a huge number of various sizes of presses, rotary screw lathes, grinders, drills, and other machines.

    We work in a coordinated and productive manner. By the end of 1948, our production level had reached twice that of the pre-war level, and we completed our five-year plan in November of last year.

    The Soviet government rewards the production development of cooperatives in various ways, assisting them in raw materials, transportation, equipment, and loans. At the beginning of last year, thanks to government credit loans, we acquired extremely valuable surface grinding machines. In addition, we obtained a state loan of 40,000 rubles to equip a combined conveyor plant.

    Wages Increased

    Conveyor equipment greatly reduced the labor of each of our members, increased productivity, and increased profits. Last year we made a profit of 5.6 million rubles, while the profit in 1947 was only 3.4 million rubles.

    Every member receives a salary. Our income has increased due to increased production. Therefore, our wage fund increased from 2,700,000 rubles in 1947 to 3,800,000 rubles in 1948. We implement a piece-rate wage system.

    In addition, at the end of each year, the cooperative allocates twenty percent of the annual profit to the members. The share received by each member is proportional to the amount of contribution they have made in production (as can be seen from the annual salary). For example, the mechanic Chipulin earned 24,336 rubles last year. When the cooperative distributed dividends, he received an additional 5,360 rubles.

    Democratic Organization

    The remaining profits of the production cooperative are used to expand production, replenish capital, and as a cultural activities fund for members.

    We also pay into the "Long-Term Credit Loan Fund," which is stipulated by the joint organization of production cooperatives to replenish the operating funds or investment capital of cooperatives with a shortage of funds, and to assist cooperatives that have suffered losses or destruction.

    The management of our cooperative is built on the broadest democratic foundations, and all matters of principle are decided by the members' congress. As for daily management, it is handled by the management committee elected by the members through secret ballot.

    Many Cooperatives Are Like Ours

    The management committee has nine members, only the chairman and vice-chairman work full-time on the committee, and the remaining members work in the factory.

    The management committee reports to the congress every three months. In addition, its work should be subject to the planned supervision of the audit committee elected by secret ballot. Employees and members of the management committee and their relatives cannot be elected as audit committee members.

    There are tens of thousands of cooperatives like ours throughout the Soviet Union. Each such cooperative not only contributes to the development of production, but also is a source of promoting the continuous rise of culture and the happiness of the working people.

    苏联生产合作社
    电力生产合作社理事会主席  Ｎ·采列契夫
    苏联有数万个生产合作社。它们和国营企业一道共同供应人民的工业品、食品和家庭物品。
    我担任理事会主席的这个生产合作社，生产熔解线（一种易熔之金属线或片，插入电流输道中以保安全—译注）、电炉、台灯、开关等各种电器设备。
    五年计划完成了
    我们的合作社是一九二九年组织的，当时只有二十五个社员，在一个小型工厂里开办着。经过了二十年来的扩展，我们的合作社已经变成一个大企业了，拥有社员三百八十人。我们应用一切最新式的工厂技术设备。几乎一切工作都机械化了，我们有巨量的各式大小的压榨机，轮转螺旋式车床、磨粉机、钻孔机和其他机器等。
    我们工作协调而有成绩。到一九四八年终，我们的生产水平达到战前的两倍，并且在上年十一月间完成了我们的五年计划。
    苏联政府用各种方法奖励合作社的生产发展，在原料、运输、装备、贷款各方面帮助合作社。去年年初，由于政府的信用贷款，我们购得了极贵重的平面碾磨机器，此外，又获得国家四万卢布贷款装备一个联合传送机厂房。
    工资增加了
    传送机设备大大地减轻了我们每个社员的劳力，提高了生产力，增加了利润。去年我们获利五百六十万卢布，而一九四七年的利润仅为三百四十万卢布。
    每一社员都领得工资。我们的收入因生产提高而增加了。因此我们的工资基金自一九四七年的二、七○○、○○○卢布增至一九四八年的三、八○○、○○○卢布。我们实行计件工资制。
    此外，每届年终，合作社提出每年赢利的百分之二十分配给社员。每个社员分得的份额依照他在生产中所作的贡献的多少（由每年的工资可以看出）成比例。例如：机械工人契蒲林上年收入二四、三三六卢布，合作社分配红利时，他又分到五、三六○卢布。
    民主的组织
    生产合作社其余的赢利用来扩大生产，充实资金，并作为社员文化活动基金。
    我们也支付“长期信用贷款基金”，这种基金是生产合作社联合组织规定用以充实资金短绌的合作社底营业资金或投资资本，并用以扶助遭受损失或破坏的合作社的。
    我们的合作社的管理是建筑在最广泛的民主基础上的，一切原则性的问题都由社员大会决定。至于日常管理则由各社员用秘密投票方式，选出管理委员会来办理。
    许多合作社都和我们的一样
    管理委员会有九个委员，只有主席和副主席全部时间在委员会工作，其余委员都在工厂工作。
    管理委员会每三个月对大会作报告一次。此外，它的工作应受由秘密投票选举出来的审核委员会有计划的监督。管理委员会的职员和委员及其亲戚不能当选为审核委员。
    象我们这样的合作社在全苏联有好几万个。每个这样的合作社不仅有助于生产底发展，而且是促进文化和劳动人民底幸福不断上升底源泉。（王更生译自一九四九年三月苏联周刊第三四七期）
