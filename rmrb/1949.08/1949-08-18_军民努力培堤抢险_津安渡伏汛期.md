Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: Tianjin, August 17th - Under the active leadership of the Flood Prevention Committee and the Flood Prevention Headquarters, and through the concerted efforts of the military and civilians, the flood prevention work in Tianjin has now been largely completed. The flood season has been safely passed. The flood prevention projects that have been completed are as follows: Reinforcement of dikes at eighteen locations, 90% completed, totaling 39,121 cubic meters; bank protection projects at twelve locations, 70% completed, with a total length of 390 meters; projects to block bridge culverts and drainage outlets are 93% completed; in addition, 48 pumping stations have been installed.

Also, Tianjin, August 17th: The People's Liberation Army stationed in Tianjin has been actively helping local residents with flood control, production, and locust eradication for the past month. Under the leadership of the River Management Committee, various units patrol and guard day and night, fighting against the floods. Several breaches occurred in sections of the North Canal south bank, such as Wangqinzhuang and Dongxinfang. The artillery battalion of a certain unit stationed in the area immediately went to plug the breaches. At the breach in Yubakou Village, the water was too strong, and the masses could not stop it. A certain regiment immediately organized a thousand people to rush to repair it, and finally completed the plugging. In helping farmers with production, one company of a certain unit plowed 240 mu of land and weeded 50 mu. In addition, various units also helped farmers eradicate locusts. The regimental commander of a certain regiment personally led more than 400 people to clear locusts from a disaster area four li wide and eight li long. Local residents expressed their heartfelt gratitude for the PLA's love-the-people actions. Many people gave cigarettes and wine to the PLA, but they were politely declined.

    又天津十七日消息：驻防天津的人民解放军，一个月来积极帮助驻地居民防水、生产和扑灭蝗虫。各部在治河委员会领导下，日夜巡逻守护，与洪水搏斗。北运河南岸的王秦庄、董新房等段，曾经有好几个地方决口，驻扎该地某部炮兵营，立即前往抢堵。鱼坝口村决口，水势过猛，群众阻挡不住，某团立即组织一千人抢修，终于完成了堵口。在帮助农民生产中，某部一个连就锄地二百四十亩，拔草五十亩。此外各部还帮助农民扑灭蝗虫，某团团长亲自带领四百多人，肃清四里宽八里长灾区的蝗虫。当地居民对解放军的爱民行动，表示衷心的感激。很多老百姓都给解放军送烟送酒，但都被解放军婉言谢绝了。
