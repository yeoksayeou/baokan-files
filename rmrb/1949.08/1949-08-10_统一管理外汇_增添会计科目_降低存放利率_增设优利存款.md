    Unified Management of Foreign Exchange, Addition of Accounting Subjects, Lowering of Deposit Interest Rates, Establishment of Preferential Interest Deposits
    ▲In order to coordinate and manage the foreign exchange business of foreign branches of designated banks, the General Management Department of the Bank of China has specifically notified designated banks to report the list of their branches within the East China region (including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces), indicating whether they intend to engage in foreign exchange business and those already engaged in foreign exchange business. Those already engaged in foreign exchange business must also indicate the date when they began operating foreign exchange after liberation.
    ▲In order to facilitate the statistical examination of the receipts and payments of specialized banks, the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China has added an item "Transactions with Specialized Banks" to its accounting subjects, starting from the 4th, in order to distinguish them from ordinary silver shops. From now on, all receipts and payments of the China and Jiaotong specialized banks in Shanghai will use the above-mentioned subject. The balance of the deposit accounts opened by these two banks at the clearing house will also be closed out completely on the 4th and transferred to the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China. In the future, all receipts and payments on the exchange will be handled by the People's Bank.
    ▲Recently, the money market in Shanghai's silver shops has eased, and the market daily interest rate has gradually declined. After discussion at a public meeting, it was decided that starting from the 5th, the quoted prices for deposits and loans would be reduced. The daily interest on deposits will be changed from 5.5 yuan per thousand yuan to 5 yuan; the daily interest on loans will be changed from 25 yuan per thousand yuan to 22 yuan, and the daily interest among peers will be changed from 20 yuan to 18 yuan.
    ▲The China General Commercial Bank and its affiliated branches in Shanghai are responding to the conservation movement by launching three types of preferential interest deposits: 1. Savings deposits, fixed-term deposits with daily interest withdrawals. 2. Short-term deposits, with deposits starting from seven days, interest compounded upon maturity. 3. Current and fixed deposits, with no fixed term and withdrawals at any time. The interest rate for the first type is temporarily set at 54 cents per month.

    ▲沪中国通商银行及所属分支行处，此次响应节约运动，特举办优利存款三种：一、节约存款，订期存本每天取息。二、短期存，款七天起存，到期不取，复利转息。三、定活两便存款，期限不拘，随时可提。利息第一种暂定月息五角四分。
