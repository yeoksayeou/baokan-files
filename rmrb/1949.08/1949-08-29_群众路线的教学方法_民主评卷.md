　　Mass Line Teaching Method
  　Democratic Grading
    Jin Feng
    For short-term training classes that aim to address certain ideological problems of students within a limited time, learning cannot proceed in a linear fashion. In addition to lectures and group discussions, a mass learning movement is needed to more effectively promote learning. Democratic grading is a mass line teaching method that combines leadership and the masses, and a mass learning movement where students encourage each other to learn.
    The method of democratic grading is as follows: After a period of theoretical study, when students are able to conduct preliminary criticism and self-criticism, a theoretical test is held. Then, the academic affairs office issues a unified, complete, clear, and focused outline of the test answers. Each class then selects a typical paper with more problems and representing the general level, as a model paper. The students in the group, based on the spirit and focus of the test answer outline, and referring to notes and books, repeatedly discuss and analyze the paper question by question, and determine the score. In this way, the students have a more comprehensive, systematic, profound, and consistent understanding of the topic discussed, and have a certain standard for scoring. Then, everyone analyzes their own answer to the same question based on this typical paper, reports their own score, explains the reason, and the score is determined by public discussion. In this way, democratic commentary is carried out on the basis of self-criticism, and theoretical struggle can be launched against erroneous arguments and muddled ideas, so that students have a further understanding of the theoretical knowledge they have learned and of criticism and self-criticism. At the same time, observing whether students are selfless and realistic in grading, not over-reporting their own scores, not deliberately attacking others, not deliberately under-reporting scores, and not covering up for each other can also measure the degree of progress in students' ideological awareness.
    Like other mass movements, to prevent democratic grading from becoming a mere formality and empty talk, it is necessary to conduct extensive and in-depth mobilization among students before grading; fully explain the significance and role of democratic grading, and inspire students' consciousness and motivate their initiative. In addition to such general appeals, the leadership must also provide specific assistance. That is, in each class or team, a typical paper is selected, and then cadres and group leaders or squad leaders first assess the typical paper based on the test answer outline, with students attending. In this way, both the group leaders and the students can understand the arguments and key points of the test answer, and also understand the spirit of democratic grading. The group leaders will also learn how to lead the group in grading. During group grading, after grading one or two papers, in order to save time, they can be divided into several mutual aid groups to carry out grading simultaneously. If there are any problems that cannot be solved, they can be submitted to the group for assessment.
    After the group has finished grading the papers, a re-evaluation is carried out. The papers are arranged and announced in order of good to bad, including the typical paper and the results of its discussion, each person's paper and the group's comments and scores on it; in this way, the good are praised, the bad are criticized, and they can learn from each other to adjust the imbalance in the scores set by the various groups. After the test papers are displayed and each group puts forward opinions to each other, each group or individual group will conduct a re-evaluation with emphasis. Generally, if there is no major difference or major problem, there is no need to re-evaluate.
    When the democratic grading is about to end, it is combined with the teaching summary; on the one hand, students review their attitude and methods of learning in this stage, what they have gained, and their life and ideological aspects, criticize each other, compete with each other, and formulate learning plans to create a learning upsurge; on the other hand, the leadership timely summarizes the situation in this stage, and through theoretical tests and democratic grading, understands the advantages and disadvantages of teaching, as a basis for improving teaching in the future, and points out the problems that students have clarified in learning and theory, the degree of ideological progress, and the problems that still exist, rewarding the good and criticizing the bad. Under the formation and development of such a delicate and profound mass movement, the students' academic achievements are consolidated and improved.

　　群众路线的教学方法
  　民主评卷

    短期学习班进行理论学习，要求在一定时间内解决学员的某些思想问题，则其学习就不能平铺直叙地进行，除大课讲授，分组讨论外，还需要掀起一个群众性的学习运动，以求更有效地推进学习。民主评卷就是一种领导与群众相结合的群众路线的教学方法和学员互相激励学习的群众性的学习运动。
    民主评卷的办法是这样的：经过了一段时间的理论学习，学员能初步进行批评和自我批评之后，举行理论测验，再由教务处发出统一、完整、明确、有重心的试题答案纲要，然后各班选出一份问题较多、能代表一般性的中等卷子作为典型卷子，由小组学员根据试题答案纲要的精神和重点，参考笔记和书本，将卷子逐题反复进行讨论，详细分析，定出分数；这样，学员对于所讨论的那个题目有了比较全面、系统、深刻、一致的了解，对于定分也有了一定的标准；然后每人根据这个典型卷子，分析自己的同一题目，自报分数，说明理由，大家公议定分。就这样在自我批评的基础上展开民主评论，并可针对了错误的论点与糊涂观念，掀起理论斗争，从而使学员对于所学习的理论认识和批评与自我批评，都得到进一步的了解。同时，在评卷时看学员是否大公无私，实事求是，不多报自己分数，不故意打击别人，不故意少报分数，不互相包庇的情形，也可以测量出学员思想意识的进步程度。
    和其他群众性的运动一样，要使民主评卷不流于形式和空洞，举行评卷以前，在学员中间进行广泛的深入的动员是必要的；充分说明民主评卷的意义和作用，启发学员的自觉性和激励他们的能动性。除了这样的一般号召外，领导上还须进行具体的帮助。这就是在每一班或一队，选择一份典型卷子，以后由干部和小组长或小队长，先根据了试题答案纲要评定典型卷子，学员列席参加。这样，就使小组长和学员都能了解试题答案的论据重点，也了解了民主评卷的精神，小组长则更学习了如何掌握领导小组进行评卷。在小组评卷时，评完一两份以后，为了节省时间，即可分为几个互助小组同时进行评卷，如果有不能解决的问题，再汇交小组评定。
    小组评完卷子后，还要进行复评。以小组为单位，按卷子成绩的好坏排列公布，包括典型卷子及对它的讨论结果，每个人的卷子及小组中对他的意见和所评分数；这样，就表扬了好的，批评了坏的，并且互相观摩，调整了各小组所定分数的不平衡。展览试卷，各组相互提出意见后，各组或个别组便进行有重点的复评，一般如无大差别或大问题则可不必复评。
    在民主评卷即将结束时，即与教学总结结合起来；一方面学员对这一阶段的学习态度、方法，有何收获以及对生活、思想诸方面进行检讨、批评、互相竞赛，订出学习计划，造成学习热潮；另方面领导及时总结这一阶段情况，通过理论测验、民主评卷，了解教学的优缺点，作为今后改进教学的依据，并指明学员在学习和理论上所明确了的问题，思想进步程度及还存在着的问题，好的奖励，坏的批评，在这样细腻深刻的群众运动的形成和发展下，巩固和提高了学员的学习成绩。
