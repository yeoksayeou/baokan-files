    An Overview of Women's Participation in Agricultural Production in the Past Half Year
    Xuan Caiyuan
    In North China this year, women's participation in agricultural production has increased compared to previous years, playing a role from spring plowing preparations to the completion of drought resistance sowing. In general, women's participation in agricultural production accounts for 50% of the female labor force. In new districts without such customs, this figure has reached 20% to 30%. In old districts with these customs, it has reached 60% to 70%, and in a few areas, it exceeds 80%. In the past, most women in the eastern Hebei region did not participate in agricultural production. Since the land reform, women's political and economic status has improved, and many have broken away from the dependent mentality of "marrying a man for clothing and food" and the erroneous view that labor is shameful, actively participating in agricultural production. According to statistics from 22 counties in the region, there are a total of 1,154,151 female laborers, of which 659,854 participated in agricultural production, accounting for 62% of the labor force. During the spring wheat planting season in Fengnan County, 12,500 women participated in spreading manure and sowing seeds, increasing to 21,200 during large-scale field sowing. In Leting County, 65,885 women participated in spring plowing (including 16,630 family members of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers), accounting for more than one-third of the total number of women, and 3,200 women learned how to turn over the soil. In the Jinzhong Second Special District, due to the urgent task of supporting the front lines, women played a greater role in spring plowing production. According to statistics from Qingyuan, Taiyuan, Xugou, and Wenshui counties, and 29 villages in Jiaocheng, 50% of women participated in tasks such as digging pits, gathering grass, making clods, delivering manure, cultivating wasteland, and spot sowing, solving the contradiction between labor shortages and supporting the front lines. Statistics from 600 villages in 10 counties in the central Hebei region show that women account for 54% of the agricultural labor force. In Ding County, Anguo County, Shen County, and Anping County, the figure reached 70% to 80%, and in Xinle County, it reached 90%. The entire Taihang region has approximately one million female laborers, with 40% participating in field production. In the river management project in the Fourth Special District, 24,000 women participated in the river work, accounting for 28% of the total workforce, and many labor models emerged. For example, in Xiuwu County, 9,408 women participated in river management, producing 356 exemplary workers. Due to the participation of a large number of women in agricultural production, a significant number of male laborers were freed up to engage in transportation and sideline occupations. For example, in Zhuangze Village, Zuoquan County, the participation of 48 women in half a month of production saved 245 male laborers. In the southern Hebei region, mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production played a significant role during the drought resistance and sowing period. For example, in Yuanzhao County, 30,000 women participated in spot sowing, accounting for 40% of the total spot sowing labor force. Women are also very active in labor mutual aid, with women accounting for 11,000 of the 44,000 laborers participating in mutual aid. In Sawu Village, Julu Seventh District, it is common for women to work in the fields. Most have learned how to operate seeders, and half can perform the labor of men. In the old areas of Chahar Province, women account for 40% of the main labor force and 80% of the auxiliary labor force. In the new areas, women account for 15% of the main labor force and 50% of the auxiliary labor force. In some villages in Yuxian County, the number of women working in the fields has doubled compared to last year. In Laishui County, women accounted for 70% of the spring sowing and seed soaking. In the old areas of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, women account for approximately 90% of the harvesting labor force and 50% of the sowing labor force. Statistics from 24 villages in Jincheng, Taiyue District, show that 3,240 women participated in weeding work. This indicates that mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production in various regions has achieved initial success.
    The above achievements in mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production this year are attributable to land reform and the people's desire to prosper through production. In addition, a large number of laborers were sent to support the front lines, and the labor shortage during the spring plowing period, especially for drought resistance and sowing, required a large workforce. The mobilization of women to participate in field production created objective conditions. Furthermore, the following measures taken by the leadership played a decisive role in mobilizing women:
    First, at the beginning of this year, the leadership clearly put forward the policy of mobilizing women to participate in the main agricultural labor force and set a goal of mobilizing 50% of the female labor force. Based on this policy, ideological mobilization was carried out among cadres in various regions, who unanimously agreed that mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production was the main key to solving the labor shortage and increasing production. Specific requirements were put forward according to different regions and conditions. For example, Ankou and Qingyuan in central Hebei proposed to ensure that 80% of women participate in general agricultural labor and 20% participate in weeding. The Tenth Special District guaranteed that 50% of women in semi-old areas and 20% to 30% in new areas would be mobilized. Pindang County in Jinzhong proposed that everyone should do a good job in women's work, and when cadres from various departments went to the countryside, they must hold special women's meetings to discuss production and solve problems. The content of each report should also focus on women's production. Leting County in eastern Hebei stipulated that when selecting female cadres, the ability to promote production should be the standard, and when selecting model villages, the quality of women's production should also be one of the standards. In Laishui County, Chahar Province, the county party committee sent special personnel to participate in and guide the women's federation meetings, and the county committee often discussed women's work, which aroused the attention of cadres. Because the leaders at all levels attached importance to this work and put it on their own work agenda, the above preliminary results were achieved. However, in some areas, the leadership did not pay enough attention, resulting in a spontaneous situation, which should be inspected and corrected.
    Second, conduct propaganda and education work, continue to overcome the traditional thinking of women "marrying a man for clothing and food" and "men in the fields, women at home," and establish the idea that labor is glorious and labor can liberate. Exemplary figures should be commended promptly, active elements should be encouraged, policies should be explained in depth, ideological concerns should be eliminated, and women's awareness should be enlightened. This year, some areas also have the tendency of using coercion and formalism. In Tuqiaopu, Hunyuan County, five women's groups were organized, but there was no work to do, and they were dismissed after picking stubble for half a day for military families. In Gaogezhuang, Xushui County, and Songzhuangzi, southern Chahar, all the women in the village were divided into groups of seven. Without persuasion or education, women were forced to produce, such as saying, "You have been allocated a piece of land. If you don't plant it, who will?" The reason for this deviation is that the leadership is superficial and eager to achieve results, lacking in-depth and patient persuasion and education work. Blindly organizing and mobilizing is not successful, and should be strictly corrected in future work.
    Third, the Party branch serves as the core leadership, with Party members and cadres taking the lead. Male Party members can focus on mobilizing the women in their own families to lead production, gradually increasing from light work to heavy work. Under the slogan of "men patiently teach, women humbly learn, and production grows by an inch," men and women work together to produce, and the effect is great. For example, Jia Lianke, the Party secretary of Liangjiaying Village in Xushui County, and other 12 Party members mobilized their wives to work in the fields, leading 70% of the village to temporarily form partnerships, pulling seed drills and plows to rush to cultivate the land. Wang Zini and other four female Party members in Potou Village, Fourteenth District of Pindang County, worked in the fields, leading 32 women to dig 66 mu of land, weed 12 mu of wheat, deliver 160 loads of manure, plant 34 trees, carry water to spot sow 4.5 mu, and repair canals for three days, totaling 92 workdays, with a length of 120 zhang, which can irrigate 70 mu of land. Li Shouhua, a female Party member in Henghe, Xiyang County, organized four women to regularly work in the fields, influencing 21 women to weed 150 mu of seedlings in ten days.
    Fourth, in terms of working methods, focus on closely linking with solving women's special problems (such as lack of freedom of marriage) and family production to get rich, and fighting against residual feudal ideas such as mistreating women and unwillingness to let women go out to work in the fields. The Taihang District put forward the slogan "Family harmony, hard work in production" and held forums for grandmothers and young and middle-aged women to discuss unity in production and solve problems, which had a great effect, and constantly corrected the practice of isolating women to carry out simple production, and combined it with family production. This is beneficial for taking care of family unity, taking care of women's physical weakness, and lack of technical difficulties. The effect of adjusting male and female labor force on the basis of the family is also very good. However, it should not be emphasized to form separate women's mutual aid groups and mutual labor allocation.

    半年来妇女参加农业生产概况
    萱采苑
    本年华北各地妇女参加农业生产，较往年增多，自春耕准备到完成抗旱播种，均起了作用。一般地区妇女参加农业生产占妇女劳力的百分之五十，无习惯的新区，也发动起百分之二十至三十。有习惯的老区则达百分之六十至七十，少数地区达百分之八十以上。冀东区过去大部妇女无参加农业生产习惯，自土改后，妇女的政治、经济地位提高，不少打破了“嫁汉嫁汉穿衣吃饭”的依赖思想，及以劳动为耻辱的错误观点，而积极的参加了农业生产。据该区二十二县统计，共有妇女劳力一百一十五万四千一百五十一人，参加农业生产的即有六十五万九千八百五十四人，占劳力百分之六十二。丰南县种春麦时，有一万二千五百名妇女参加撒粪、下种，到大田播种时则增到二万一千二百名。乐亭县参加春耕的妇女六万五千八百八十五人（内有烈军工属一万六千六百三十人），占妇女数的三分之一强，并有三千二百个妇女学会了垡地。晋中二专，由于支前任务紧迫，妇女在春耕生产中发挥了更大的作用，据清源、太原、徐沟、文水四个县，及交城二十九个村的统计，有百分之五十的妇女参加了刨坑、搂草、打土块、送粪，刨荒地、点种下种等工作，解决了劳力不足与支前的矛盾。冀中区十个县六百个村的统计，参加农业生产的妇女占百分之五十四，如定县、安国、深县、安平，都达百分之七十至八十，新乐县百分之九十。太行全区女劳力共约一百万个，下地生产的达百分之四十。四专治河工程中，有二万四千妇女投入河工，占总工数百分之二十八，并涌现了不少的劳动模范，如修武县参加治河的妇女九千四百零八人，出现英模三百五十六名。由于广大妇女参加了农业生产，大大的节省了男劳力去搞运输副业，如左权县庄则一个村四十八个妇女参加半个月的生产即节省下男劳力二百四十五个。冀南区发动妇女参加农业生产，在抗旱点种期间作用很大，如元朝县下地点种的三万个妇女，占点种的总劳力百分之四十。在劳动互助中妇女也非常积极，参加互助的四万四千个劳力中，妇女即有一万一千个。钜鹿七区洒雾村，下地生产的妇女很普遍，大部学会了耩地，有一半能顶男子劳动。察哈尔省老区参加主要劳动的妇女百分之四十，参加辅助劳动的百分之八十，新区参加主要劳动的百分之十五，辅助劳动的百分之五十。蔚县有的村妇女下地生产较去年增加了一倍，涞水县春播侵种时妇女占百分之七十。冀鲁豫区老区妇女下地收割的约百分之九十，点种的百分之五十。太岳区晋城二十四村的统计，有三千二百四十名妇女参加了锄苗工作。说明各地发动妇女参加农业生产，均已获得初步成绩。
    本年动员妇女参加农业生产，所以能获得上述成绩除土地改革，群众要求生产发家；再加大批劳力支前，春耕期间劳力异常困难给抗旱点种势须庞大人力，动员妇女参加田间生产造成了客观条件外，领导上采取了以下措施，对发动妇女起了决定作用：
    第一、今年领导上一开始即明确提出发动妇女参加农业生产主要劳动的方针，并提出发动百分之五十妇女劳动力的目标，各地根据这一方针，在干部中作了思想动员，一致认为发动妇女参加农业生产是解决劳力困难和增加生产的主要关键，并按不同地区、不同条件提出具体要求，如冀中安口、清苑，提出保证发动百分之八十的妇女参加一般农业劳动，百分之二十参加锄苗；十专区保证半老区发动百分之五十，新区发动百分之二十至三十。晋中平定县提出，人人要作好妇女工作，各部门干部下乡时，必须召开专门妇女会议，讨论生产解决问题，每次报告内容，妇女生产也做为重点之一，冀东乐亭县规定选拔妇女干部时，以能带动生产为标准，选拔模范村时也以妇女生产好坏为标准之一，察哈尔省涞水县，妇联每次开会时，县委均派专人参加指导，县委会并经常的讨论妇女工作，引起干部的重视。因为各级领导上重视了这一工作，放到自己工作日程上来，因此才获得以上初步成绩，但也有的地区，领导重视不够，形成自流，还应检查纠正。
    第二、开展宣传教育工作，继续克服妇女“嫁汉嫁汉，穿衣吃饭”及“男在洼，女在家”的传统思想，树立劳动光荣，劳动才能解放的思想，即时表扬模范，鼓励积极分子，深入的解释政策，肃清思想顾虑，启发妇女的自觉。今年某些地区也存在着强迫命令和形式主义的作风。浑源县土桥铺组织了五个妇女小组，没有活干，给军属拾茬半天就散了。徐水县高各庄，察南宋庄子，把全村妇女均编为七人一组。也不说服教育，强制妇女生产，如说“你分了一份地，你不种叫谁去种？”这种偏向发生的原因，是领导漂浮和急于求成，缺乏深入耐心的说服教育工作，盲目的去组织、发动是不成功的，今后在工作中应严格纠正。
    第三、支部为核心领导，以党员、干部带头，男党员可着重动员自己家里的妇女带动生产，由轻活到重活，逐步提高，并提出男子耐心教导，女子虚心学习，在生产长一寸的口号下，男女协力生产，效果很大，如徐水县梁家营支书贾连科等十二个党员，动员自己的老婆下地生产，带动了全村百分之七十的户临时打伙，拉耧、拉耠子，突击耕种，平定县十四区坡头村王子妮等四个女党员下地生产，带动了三十二个妇女刨地六十六亩，锄麦十二亩，送粪一百六十担，植树三十四棵，担水点种四亩五分，修渠三天，共九十二个工，长一百二十丈，能浇地七十亩。昔阳县横河女党员李寿花组织了四个妇女经常下地生产，影响了二十一个妇女，十天锄苗一百五十亩。
    第四、在工作方式上着重与解决妇女特殊问题密切联系（如婚姻不自由等）与家庭生产发家致富密切联系，与虐待妇女，不愿妇女出门下地等残余的封建思想作斗争。太行区提出“家庭和睦，努力生产”的口号，并召开老婆婆、青壮年妇女座谈会，讨论团结生产解决问题，收效很大，并不断的纠正了孤立的发动妇女单纯进行生产的做法，与家庭生产结合进行。这样对照顾家庭团结，照顾妇女体力弱，技术缺乏等困难，均有好处。在以家庭为基础的条件下进行男女劳力调剂效果亦很好。但不应强调另组妇女互助组与互力拨工。
