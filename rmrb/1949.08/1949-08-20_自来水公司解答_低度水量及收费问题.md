Water Company Answers Questions on Minimum Water Usage and Charges

To the Editor:

Currently, we are promoting water conservation. Why is there a provision for minimum water usage? If a household's water usage is less than the minimum, they still have to pay for the minimum amount. Doesn't this contradict the call for water conservation? Also, what is the basis for the regulations regarding water meter size and minimum water usage? If a household used a lot of water in the past, so they installed a one-inch water meter, but now they use very little, if they are still charged based on a one-inch meter, with a minimum of ten cubic meters, isn't this wasteful? If they change to a four-point meter, won't this increase consumption of manpower, materials, and money? Please provide a detailed answer.

　　　　　　　Sincerely,
    　　　　　　　Xing Zhi

Mr. Xing Zhi:

The water company's response to your questions is as follows:

"Our company's regulations for minimum water usage charges are based on the common practices of water utilities in various regions. The minimum water fee includes equipment and consumption costs. For example, even when a user is not using water, the company's water source pumping station cannot stop operating. It must continue to pump water to maintain water pressure for users, which still consumes power and materials.

The basis for water meter size and minimum water usage is determined with reference to the water usage of general users. For example, the current minimum water usage for a four-point water meter, four cubic meters, can supply water for families and stores with up to five people. The current minimum water usage for a four-point water meter in Tianjin is 6.8 cubic meters. Our company's rate was also 6.8 cubic meters twenty-seven years ago. Regarding the installation of a one-inch water meter and subsequent reduction in water usage, you can apply to the company to change to a four-point water meter. The water meter is free, and the cost of other labor and materials required for the change will be charged."

### 自来水公司解答　低度水量及收费问题

　　自来水公司解答
  　低度水量及收费问题编者先生：
    目前提倡节约用水，何以有低度水量的规定？使各户用水凡不足低度水量时，亦须按低度水量缴费，这是否与节约用水号召相违？又关于水表口径与低度水量是根据什么规定的？假如从前因需水很多，故装按水表口径为一寸，目前需水甚少，如仍依一寸口径水表计算，其低度水量为十公吨，是否因之浪费用水？假如改装水表口径为四分，是否在人力物资金钱上增加消耗？请详细解答为盼。
    　　　　　　　醒智醒智先生：
    你提的问题承自来水公司答复如下：
    “本公司规定低度水量收费办法，系照各地自来水事业之通例办理，其低度水费内包括有设备、消耗费用在内，例如用户在不用水时公司水源地送水机不能因而停开，须照常送水保持水压以待用户用水，仍须消耗动力材料等项费用。
    关于水表口径与规定低度水量之根据，系参照一般用户用水情形而定，如现行四分口径水表低度水量，四公吨可供给五口人以内之家庭、商店用水，天津现行低度水量四分水表为六·八公吨，本公司二十七年前亦为六·八公吨，至按装一寸口径水表因用水减少改装四分水表一节，可来公司办理申请改装手续，水表免费，更换所需其他工料费用照收。”
