I have several medical questions and hope that your newspaper will answer them in the service section.

　　2. What is B.C.G. vaccine?
　　3. What is the pituitary gland?
　　4. What is the difference between acne and rosacea, what are the specific treatments, and how can they be prevented?
　　5. What are the effects of electrotherapy (such as sun lamps, ultraviolet rays, etc.), and what diseases require which type of electrotherapy?
　　6. What disease manifestations are included in the generally referred to kidney disease?
　　7. If there is already inflammation and suppuration, will taking anti-inflammatory pills have the effect of stopping the suppuration?

　　Zhang Xuewen, Chen He

Dear Mr. Zhang Xuewen and Mr. Chen He:

We have received your letter. The answers to your questions provided by the Health Department of the North China People's Government are as follows:

　　"(1) After clinical experiments by doctors, the effectiveness of streptomycin for lung disease is not very great, but it is still effective for early-stage lung disease. It is incorrect for some to overestimate the efficacy of streptomycin. This medicine is often used in large quantities, which is uneconomical.
　　(2) B.C.G. vaccine is the English name for Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine, which is a preventive vaccine against tuberculosis and has no curative effect.
　　(3) The pituitary gland is an inherent tissue in the human body, located in the brain; its function is very important, and it has a great effect on human reproduction, growth, and metabolism. Overdevelopment and underdevelopment of the pituitary gland can cause systemic endocrine diseases. If it is overdeveloped, it can cause gigantism and acromegaly; if it is underdeveloped, it can cause dwarfism, infertility, and obesity.
　　(4) Acne is the same as pimples, which often occur during puberty. There is no good treatment, but injecting sex hormones may help.
　　(5) The function of electrotherapy is a type of physical therapy that is effective for unhealthy people. It is mostly used for poor development, infertility, etc.
　　(6) Kidney disease generally refers to nephritis, which is scientific. What you are referring to may be due to increased sexual desire, what traditional Chinese medicine calls kidney deficiency. These are not kidney diseases, but symptoms caused by excessive sexual desire, which are symptoms of neurasthenia, such as dizziness, tinnitus, general weakness, and blurred vision.
　　(7) Anti-inflammatory pills are ineffective for those that are already suppurating.
　　(8) Regarding the medicines advertised on the streets, in newspapers, and on the radio, some are effective, and some have very little effect. Therefore, when using them, you should consult a doctor before buying them. Do not buy them just because you see an advertisement, as you will definitely be deceived. The government has control measures.
　　(9) The average person's body is up to the normal standard. General hospitals have body check-up services.
　　(10) Serum is blood without blood cells. Blood sedimentation is a blood test to diagnose diseases." (Health Department of the North China People's Government)

　　医学问答十则编辑先生：
    兹有数项医学上的疑问，希贵报于服务版代为解答是盼。
    一、链霉素经医师临床实验后，是否真是肺病特效药？
    二、何谓Ｂ·Ｃ·Ｇ疫苗？
    三、何谓脑下垂体？
    四、面疱与酒刺有何不同，有何特殊治法，并如何预防？
    五、电疗（如太阳灯、紫外线等）都有何效力，什么病需要那种电疗？
    六、一般所说的肾病，包括什么病象？
    七、消炎片，如已经发炎化脓时，吃他能有化脓的效力否？
    八、街头、报纸及无线电都有很多药品的广告，效力是否可靠？政府是否有管制的办法？
    九、一般人的身体，是否合乎正常人的标准？北平那个医院有身体检查的业务？
    十、何谓血沉和血清？
  　张学文　陈赫张学文、陈赫　二位先生：
    你们来的信我们收到了，问的问题承华北人民政府卫生部解答如下：
    “（一）链霉素经医师临床实验，对肺病的特效不太大，但对初期肺病还是有效的。有人把链霉素的功效估计过高是不对的。这种药往往用的量很多，不经济。
    （二）Ｂ·Ｃ·Ｇ疫苗，是卡介苗的英文名字，是防备结核病的预防疫苗，没有治病之效
    （三）脑下垂体，是人体一种固有的组织，存在于脑子中；它的作用非常大，对于人体的生殖、生长、新陈代谢，都有很大的作用。脑下垂体发育过度与发育不好，都可以引起全身内分泌的病。假若它过度的发育则可以发生巨人症、肢端肥大；如果它发育不好，则发生侏儒病、生殖不能、肥胖病。
    （四）面疱即是粉刺，多发生于思春期，没有什么好的治疗办法，不过用异性贺尔蒙注射是可以的。
    （五）电疗的作用是物理疗法的一种，对于不健康的人有效力。多用于发育不好，生殖不能等。
    （六）肾病一般是指肾脏炎，这是科学的。你所说的可能是由于性欲的亢进，中医所谓的肾亏，这都不是肾脏病，而是由于性欲亢进过度而发生的症状，即是神经衰弱的症状，如：头晕、耳鸣、全身无力、眼花等症状。
    （七）消炎片对已化脓的吃了无效。
    （八）关于街头、报纸、无线电里的药品有的有效，有的效力很小，所以用时应当去找医生再去买，不能看到广告便去买，那一定上当，政府有管制的办法。
    （九）一般人的身体是合乎正常的。检查身体一般医院都有此业务。
    （十）血清是没有血球的血液。血沉是诊断疾病的一种血液试验。”（华北人民政府卫生部）
