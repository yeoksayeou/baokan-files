　　Combining On-Campus Students to Organize New Study
  　Study Group Returnees' Activities
    [Our Newspaper] During the summer vacation, most of the Peking University members left the school to participate in work or study, and the various activities of the school's Communist Youth League were suspended. Now, the students outside have returned to school, and group life has been re-established. The various departments held branch meetings on the evenings of the 17th and 18th of this month to discuss the study and life issues of the second half of the summer vacation. Because the Peking University Communist Youth League members had only studied the draft of the League Constitution, and the official League Constitution had never been discussed, the main content of study this month is the League Constitution and Comrade Jiang Nanxiang's report on the League Constitution at the First National Congress of the Communist Youth League. Mutual aid groups have now been formed to conduct study. (Peking University Correspondent Group)
    [Our Newspaper] After graduating, the Fu Jen Catholic University students who participated in the study group returned to the school and combined with the students who stayed on campus during the summer vacation to form six study groups. They will start studying this week. The content of the study is mainly historical materialism. The students who returned from the study group are enthusiastically helping the students on campus to intensify their studies. (Fu Jen Catholic University Correspondent Group)
    [Our Newspaper] The comrades in charge of the Beijing Normal University Student Union and the Communist Youth League branch went to the League training class for study. The Student Union has hired other students to temporarily take charge of the Student Union's tasks; the League branch has organized a new branch based on the League members who returned from the study group as the backbone cadres. The main tasks now are to consolidate and expand the students' summer study and to prepare for the new work. (Beijing Normal University Correspondent Group)

　　结合在校同学组织新的学习
  　学习团回校同学活动
    【本报讯】暑假里，北京大学团员们大部离校参加工作或学习，校中青年团的各种活动无形中中止了。现在，在外面的同学都已回校，小组生活又建立起来了。各院分别在本月十七日和十八日晚上召开分支大会，讨论后半个暑假的学习和生活问题。因为北大的青年团员只学习过团章草案，关于正式团章一直没有讨论，所以在本月里学习的主要内容就是团章和蒋南翔同志在青年团全国第一次代表大会上关于团章的报告，现在已分别组成互助小组，进行学习。（北大通讯组）
    【本报讯】辅大参加学习团同学自结业以后回到学校，即与暑期在校同学结合起来组成六个学习小组，本周即将展开学习，学习内容：第一部分仍以唯物史观为主，学习团回校的同学很热心的帮忙在校的同学加紧学习。（辅大通讯组）
    【本报讯】北师学生会和青年团支部负责的同志，大部分都到团训班去学习。学生会为此另聘请同学临时主持学生会的任务；团支部则以学习团回来的团员为基础干部，组织了新的支部。现在主要的工作，是巩固与扩展同学暑期的学习，和准备迎接新工作。（北师通讯组）
