    How Can Studying Be Considered Connecting with Reality?
    Chen Junsheng
    Studying needs to connect with reality, this is an old issue, but how can it be considered connecting with reality? What should be connected? Some comrades have not completely resolved this issue, and there are biases in their understanding. Some comrades believe that learning by doing is connecting with reality (which has its correct side). Comrades working in rural areas only pay attention to issues such as repairing ploughs and exchanging labor, and only look for these materials in newspapers, only knowing that what is needed at the moment is reality; they are not interested in studying policies and theories, believing it is not very useful. What they are willing to learn is work methods, and by work methods, they mean very specific, even trivial things, such as, "How to evaluate manpower when organizing mutual aid labor exchange?" "How should district cadres talk to branches when going to the countryside?" etc. They hope that there are clear regulations for these methods, how to deal with this matter when encountered, and how to deal with that matter when encountered, so as to learn a complete set of work methods. This is particularly necessary for newly promoted district and village cadres, because they do not have much work experience and have not yet figured out a set of work methods, for the sake of learning from others. However, if learning is only confined to this stage, it is far from enough. They only know how to learn methods, but do not know where the methods come from, and do not know that only by understanding policies and theories can these policies be implemented in different environments to produce various work methods. Learning some rigid methods, which are very good experiences here, may not be useful in another place, because the conditions there are different. This kind of learning is a narrow empirical learning method.
    The purpose of learning is to do a good job in revolutionary work. Connecting with practical work is to improve and enhance our work, that is to say, our revolutionary workers should not only have the idea of serving the people, but more importantly, be good at serving the people (to serve well). Every piece of work we do is under the overall situation and the Party's general line, with its policy scope and theoretical basis. We must first study and understand the overall situation and the Party's general line, and have a deep understanding of the policies that directly guide our work and related policies, and then implement them according to the specific situation. Only in this way can we avoid losing our direction and being trapped in narrow事務ism, and can we gradually improve our political level and do our work better. Otherwise, our work will make blind mistakes. Many problems will arise in the process of completing each task. To solve the specific problems in the work, we must combine the Party's policies and guidelines, study the nature of the problems, and seek solutions under the guidance of certain policies and guidelines. After completing the work, we must summarize it and raise our past set of practical work to the level of policy theory for analysis and research, so as to examine our work: what is right, what is wrong, what are the errors in methods and approaches, what are the deviations in principles, whether the Party's policies and guidelines are in line with the actual situation, and what are the reasons… In this way, when writing reports to higher authorities, we will not fall into empty and general enumeration of phenomena, but rather raise problems and experiences with analysis and criticism. This is a very good way to study and connect with reality.
    Leading comrades should pay attention to combining theoretical study with solving work problems, so that cadres can better understand and grasp the Party's policies under the inspiration of theoretical study, and better solve practical problems. Only when leading comrades combine the ideological reality and work reality of the cadres to organize learning, will the cadres be encouraged by their own progress and the achievements of improving their work, and work competently and energetically, with work and study promoting each other. In this way, learning will also become regular and will no longer be seen as a burden.
    Secondly, in the process of learning, we should pay attention to constantly improving our thinking. Only with continuous progress in thinking can the improvement of work be guaranteed. Therefore, in learning, we should pay attention to the connection with thinking. For example, when we study the spirit of the Second Plenary Session calling on all comrades in the Party to continue to maintain the style of modesty, prudence, no arrogance, no impetuosity, and hard work, we should carefully study the basic spirit of the document, contact our own thinking, check the problems existing in our thinking, and improve our thinking to a higher level. For another example, when learning policies and theories, we should check whether our original views on understanding problems are correct, why, what ideological problems have been solved in the learning, and what are the remaining divergent understandings and outstanding problems to be solved. Some comrades working in organs believe that comrades working in factories or rural areas are often tempered among the masses, and their thinking progresses very quickly, while organ work does not help much with thinking. This shows that they have not connected learning with their own ideological reality. For comrades working in organs, paying attention to learning and contacting ideological reality is the main aspect of learning to connect with reality.
    Finally, it is also worth mentioning that: if there is no spirit of intensive study in learning, there is no possibility of connecting with reality, because what we learn (especially theory and policy) has a certain depth. If we do not study deeply and carefully and dissect its inherent spiritual essence, it is impossible to achieve contact with thinking, and it is impossible to understand it well, and therefore it is impossible to implement it into practical work.

### 怎样学习才算联系实际？

    怎样学习才算联系实际？
    陈俊生
    学习要联系实际，已是老问题了，但怎样才算联系实际？联系些什么？这个问题有些同志还没有完全解决，在认识上还有偏向。有的同志认为做一样学一样就是联系实际（有其对的一面），作农村工作的同志就单纯的注意插犋换工等一些问题，看报也只是专门找这些材料，只知道眼前需要的就是实际；对于学政策、理论问题不感兴趣，认为没多大用处。他们所愿学的是工作办法，所谓工作办法是指每一件很具体的，甚至是琐碎的事情，比如，“组织互助换工人马评分怎办？”“区干部下乡怎样找支部谈话”等等。这些办法，他们希望都有明确的规定，遇到这一件事情怎办，遇到那一件事情又怎办，从而学会一整套的工作办法。这一些，特别对新提拔的区村干部说来，因为自己还没有多少工作经验，还没有摸出一套工作方法，为借镜起见，当然这些也是必要的。但若把学习仅仅停留在这一阶段，那便非常不够了。只知学办法，却不知办法是从那里来的，不知道只有把政策、理论搞通以后，才能在不同的环境中贯彻这些政策，产生各种工作办法。学些死办法，在这里是很好的经验，到另一个地方就不一定能用得上，因为那里的条件不一样了。这种学习是一种狭隘的经验主义的学习方法。
    学习的目的，是为了把革命工作做好。联系实际工作是为了改进与提高我们的工作，即是说，我们革命工作者不但要具备为人民服务的思想，而重要的是要善于为人民服务（要服务的好）。我们做每一件工作都是在整个时局形势与党的总路线下，有其政策范围和理论根据的，我们必须事先对时局形势与党的总路线进行研究达到理解，对直接指导本身工作的政策以及有关的政策有深刻的理解，再根据具体情况，加以贯彻，这样我们才不致失迷方向，陷在狭小的事务主义中去，才能使我们的政治水平逐步提高，把工作做得更好。否则，我们的工作就会犯盲动的错误。完成每一件工作中间都会发生很多问题，解决工作中的具体问题，必须结合党的政策方针，研究问题的性质，在一定的政策方针指示下求得解决办法。作完工作一定要总结，把我们做过去的一整套实际工作提高到政策理论上来加以分析研究，从而检查我们的工作：那些是对，那些不对，那些是方法方式上的错误，那些是原则上的偏向，党的政策方针是否切合实际情况，原因何在……这样，给上级写报告时就不致流于空空泛泛的罗列现象，而是有分析有批判的提出问题和经验。这是一种很好的学习联系实际的办法。
    领导同志应注意使理论学习与解决工作问题结合起来，使干部在理论学习启示之下更好的了解与掌握党的政策，更好地解决实际问题。只有领导同志结合干部们的思想实际与工作实际，组织学习，才会使干部被自己的进步与改进工作的成绩所鼓舞，胜任愉快而有朝气的工作，工作与学习互相推动。这样，学习也会变得经常，不再被看成负担了。
    其次，在学习过程中要注意不断地把思想提高。只有思想上不断的向前进步，工作的提高才能有保证。因此学习中应重视对思想的联系。例如我们学习二中全会文件中号召全党同志继续保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁和艰苦奋斗的作风，就应该深思熟虑的钻研文件的基本精神，接触自己的思想，检查自己思想中存在的问题，把思想水平提高一步。又例如学政策、理论时，就应该检查一下我们原来认识问题的观点是否正确，为什么，学习中解决了些什么思想问题，还有那些分歧的认识及尚待解决的问题。有些机关工作的同志认为在工厂或农村里工作的同志经常在群众中锻炼，思想进步都很快，机关工作对思想上帮助不大。这说明他们没有把学习和自己的思想实际联系起来。在机关里工作的同志，注意学习接触思想实际，是学习联系实际的主要方面。
    最后还值得提出的是：如果在学习中没有钻研的精神就没有联系实际的可能，因为我们所学的东西（特别是理论、政策）都具有一定深度的，如果我们不深入的细心钻研，剖解开其内在的精神实质，即不可能达到联系思想，就不能很好领会，因而也就不可能贯彻到实际工作里边去。
