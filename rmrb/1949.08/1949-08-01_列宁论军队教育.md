Lenin, the beloved leader of the Soviet people, the genius thinker, the great strategist, the organizer and leader of the Bolshevik Party, and the founder of the world's first Soviet socialist state, has been dead for twenty-four years.

Lenin's enormous and extensive political activities have had a strong influence on our entire era. Stalin, Lenin's great comrade-in-arms, inherited Lenin's cause and sought happiness for all advanced and progressive humanity.

Lenin's ideological legacy is great and invaluable. During the Civil War, in the years of our struggle to build socialism, and during the Great Patriotic War, we drew strength from Lenin's teachings. This doctrine also illuminates our path in the current stage of struggling for the gradual transition from socialism to communism.

Comrade Stalin, in the complete system of advanced Soviet military science and military thought that he created, developed Lenin's most valuable instructions on military issues and on the army education of the Soviet people and their armed forces in a spirit of infinite loyalty to defend our socialist motherland.

Lenin and Stalin clearly delineated the spiritual and combat qualities that must be cultivated in our soldiers, which refers to the requirements of a modern soldier.

In his historic radio address on July 3, 1941, Comrade Stalin pointed out: "The great Lenin, who created our country, once said that the main quality of the Soviet people should be courage and determination in struggle, fearless of everything, and determined to fight with the people against the enemies of our motherland. This excellent quality of the Bolsheviks must be made a quality possessed by millions upon millions of our Red Army and Red Navy, as well as all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union."

The Soviet people's victory in the Great Patriotic War, which has worldwide historical significance, is a brilliant symbol of the great achievements of the Bolshevik Party's educational work. The victory of the Soviet armed forces is inseparable from an educational system that is completely superior to that of the German fascist army.

From the first day of the existence of the Soviet regime, Lenin and Stalin carried out tremendous work to establish the armed forces of the Soviet state, to build a new type of army, an army of workers and peasants who had been liberated; this army was educated in the spirit of friendship and proletarian internationalism among all ethnic groups in our country. At the same time, they proceeded from the fact that we do not live in a single country, but in a system of many countries, and that the Soviet people must build communism under conditions of capitalist encirclement. Lenin taught us: "...the ruling class, the proletariat, if it wants to and will exercise rule, should also prove this with its own military organization..." (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 24, page 122 - Third Edition).

That is why Lenin regarded army education as the most important part of the people's communist education. This determines the characteristics of Soviet army education. These characteristics also arise from the special tasks of the armed forces of the Soviet state and from the fundamental differences between our army and the bourgeois army.

Soviet army education is a systematic and purposeful transformation of the consciousness, character, and physique of Soviet soldiers, to develop the qualities they should possess as defenders of the world's first socialist country.

In contrast to the principles of education of German fascist and other reactionary soldiers, which are based on forced discipline, keeping soldiers away from political life, and trying to turn them into soulless machines, the most important principle of Soviet army education is to cultivate conscious discipline, let soldiers actively participate in domestic political life, and strive to make all Soviet soldiers conscious fighters who understand the great liberation goals and tasks.

Lenin said about this:

"In the eighteenth century, a Prussian king said such a clever thing: 'If our soldiers knew why we were fighting, then no war could be fought.' This old and senile Prussian king was not a fool. When we compare our situation with that of this king, we can now fully say: we are able to wage war, because the masses know why they are fighting, they are willing to fight, despite unprecedented disasters – I repeat, now the disasters of war are even more serious than under the Tsar – they know that enduring this unbearable serious sacrifice is to defend their own socialist cause..." (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 24, page 62).

Comrade Stalin expressed this idea as follows when talking about the three characteristics of the Red Army: "...an army that knows why it is fighting is invincible." The outcome of the Great Patriotic War fully confirmed this conclusion.

It can be seen from this that the Soviet army's education system should conduct constant work to improve the political consciousness of the masses and promote the just and noble ideas of the Lenin and Stalin party.

Political education first helps to promote and consolidate the feelings of Soviet patriotism among the people. Soviet patriotism is a new and supreme type of patriotism: it does not divide, but on the contrary, unites all ethnic groups in our country into a united fighting family. This should be seen as the foundation of the indestructible friendship of all the peoples of the Soviet Union.

Under the leadership of the Lenin and Stalin party, the heroic Soviet people have turned our country into an advanced socialist power that is ahead of the entire historical era of capitalism. The Soviet people's greatest historical achievement for mankind is that capitalism has been eliminated in the Soviet Union, the regime of working people has been established, socialism has been built, and world civilization has been saved from the trampling of fascist bandits. Therefore, in Soviet society, the feeling of patriotism has become a manifestation of Soviet national pride. Naturally, the promotion of Soviet national pride is inseparable from the struggle against the unthinking and flattering decadent bourgeois culture.

On the basis of Soviet patriotism, the high spiritual and combat qualities of Soviet soldiers have been developed.

On December 11, 1937, Comrade Stalin described the image of a Leninist political activist in his speech to the voters of the Stalin electoral district in Moscow. He said that Lenin was a person with clear and firm ideas, with a fearless spirit in battle, unmerciful to the enemies of the people, good at overcoming any phenomena similar to panic, very wise and calm in solving complex problems, upright, loyal and loving to his own people. All these excellent Leninist qualities are fully manifested in Comrade Stalin. The image of Lenin and the image of Stalin are the ideals of Soviet soldiers. The biographies of Lenin and Stalin give us the richest materials for army education, to cultivate the high spiritual and combat qualities that our motherland's defenders must have. Studying their biographies is one of the most effective methods of mass communist education.

The most important task of Soviet army education is to do everything possible to consolidate the discipline, system, and organization of the army.

Lenin himself was a model of party and military discipline, and he educated the Bolshevik Party, our people, and the Soviet army in this spirit.

Lenin could not tolerate the slightest slackening or fatigue. In difficult times, when the young Soviet state was in crisis, Lenin's demands were particularly strict and ruthless. During the war, Lenin demanded that all aspects of the lives of Soviet citizens be subordinate to the task of national defense. Comrade Stalin emphasized this last word of Lenin in his "May Day" order in 1943:

"We must remember the last words of the great Lenin: 'Since war has become inevitable – we must use everything for the war, the slightest slackening and lack of perseverance should be punished according to the laws of war'."

Lenin demanded that strict and resolute means be adopted to fight for the establishment of discipline, system, and organization in the front and rear. Lenin wrote in his letter to workers and peasants on defeating Kolchak:

"Whoever does not wholeheartedly help the Red Army, whoever does not do everything possible to maintain order and discipline in the Red Army, is a traitor and a traitor to the country, he is a supporter of Kolchak, and such people should be executed mercilessly" (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 24, page 432).

In order to protect the interests of the people, Lenin always fought against all indecisive and unconfident phenomena. He hated hesitant, cowardly, and weak people, who are easily betrayed. Lenin pointed out that there is no political difference between a weak traitor and a traitor with ulterior motives and plans.

Lenin wanted the Bolsheviks to instill in every Soviet soldier the awareness that the key to a quick and victorious end to the war is their courage, determination, and loyalty. At the same time, Lenin demanded the ruthless suppression of cowards, panic-stricken people, and deserters.

"Shooting – this is the legal sanction against cowards in wartime." (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 24, page 316).

The characteristic of Soviet army discipline is that it relies on the patriotism of our soldiers and on their awareness that defending the motherland is their bounden duty.

Lenin greatly respected the people and often mentioned their consciousness in his speeches to the masses. Lenin never concealed difficulties in front of them. On the contrary, he truthfully explained the situation and demanded the mobilization of all forces to overcome difficulties.

In the years of the Civil War, Lenin emphasized that it was not possible to stop the war halfway, either we win or the imperialists and the White Army win. Therefore, Lenin's slogan was: "Either death or victory!"

For example, Lenin said in his speech to the students of Sverdlov University who were going to the front: "For those who are going to the front, they are representatives of workers and peasants, and there is no other choice. Their slogan should be – either death or victory" (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 24, page 499).

In the autumn of 1918, Lenin pointed out in a letter from the Central Committee to all party members: "All Red Army troops must realize that this is a matter of life and death for the working class, so there can be no slackening. Commanders have only one choice: either victory or death..." (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 34, page 45).

Lenin regarded the spirit of being ready to die for victory as one of the most important qualities of a soldier. Lenin wrote about this quality as early as before the Great October Socialist Revolution. For example, Lenin wrote after the Moscow Uprising in 1905: "We must remember that a great mass struggle is coming... The masses should know that they are going to embark on an armed, bloody and life-and-death struggle. We must promote the spirit of being ready to die in the masses and guarantee victory" (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 10, page 53).

Lenin paid special attention to the education of raising vigilance, and especially to strictly guarding state and military secrets. He taught the Soviet people to be vigilant at all times in their entire work area, especially in the army and military target areas.

Lenin demanded that those who helped the enemy by revealing state and military secrets with their love of making trouble and talking nonsense be severely punished.

Due to the White Army's attack on Petrograd, in May 1919, Lenin called on all conscious workers and peasants, especially railway employees and political workers, to rise up and fight against spies and saboteurs in a speech entitled "Strictly Guard Against Spies! Eliminate Spies!" "Be vigilant everywhere, think of more ways and use the most severe means to search for spies and White Party members and arrest them."

Lenin and Stalin emphasized that a high degree of vigilance is necessary, especially after victory. Comrade Stalin said in his recollection of Lenin: "...It was precisely after the victory that he was particularly vigilant and cautious" (Selected Works of Lenin and Stalin, Moscow Edition, 1936, page 5). Lenin had this style because he deeply understood the conspiracies of class enemies.

Lenin taught us to carry out the struggle until the enemy is completely annihilated.

Lenin pointed out in the article "Salute to the Workers of Petrograd" that Yudenich's army had been crushed and was retreating, calling out:

"Worker comrades, Red Army comrades!

You must concentrate all your strength! In any case, pursue the retreating army, annihilate them, and do not give them an hour or a minute to breathe. Now we can and should do everything possible to launch an assault in order to eliminate the enemy" (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 24, page 516).

In Lenin's many orders during the Civil War, it was strictly required to carry out the war to the end, completely annihilate the White Army, and smash foreign armed interventionists.

Comrade Stalin wrote during the Great Patriotic War: "Red Army fighters, commanders, and political workers, you must firmly remember the teachings of our mentor Lenin: 'First, do not be overwhelmed by victory, do not be arrogant or impetuous; second, consolidate the victory; third, annihilate the enemy'" (Stalin, "On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet People", page 84).

Lenin paid special attention to the cultivation of the honor and dignity of Soviet soldiers. The honor of a Soviet soldier first requires him to fulfill the military oath and to do everything possible to maintain the high combat effectiveness of the Red Army, which has been achieved through the efforts of the entire people.

Lenin demanded that our army constantly improve its operations. As early as 1918, Lenin approved the "Red Army Fighter Service Manual", which contained basic instructions on politically and militarily educating our soldiers in the spirit of fulfilling the military oath and the indomitable spirit of the great Russian commander Suvorov's "Science of Victory". Therefore, the Red Army Soldier Manual promoted the best fighting traditions of the Russian army. This manual also described in detail the basic duties of commanders and fighters, which greatly supplemented the shortcomings of the queue regulations and field regulations.

Comrade Stalin is the qualified successor to Lenin's cause. It is honestly said in our party and people: "Stalin, he is Lenin today."

Comrade Stalin, like Lenin, constantly educates the Soviet people and their armed forces, and must always be prepared for battle. Comrade Stalin taught us:

"We must remember the instructions of the great Lenin, when turning to peaceful labor, we must always be vigilant, and protect our armed forces and national defense like protecting our own eyeballs" (Stalin, Order of the Ministry of Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, May 1, 1946, published by the National Publishing Bureau, 1946, pages 8-9).

Stalin, like Lenin, also teaches us not to be satisfied with the achievements already made, and to strive for new and higher achievements in military and political education every day. The cause of consolidating peace requires us to do this, and the cause of ensuring our national security requires us to do this.

Stalin constantly taught us to raise revolutionary vigilance, called on us to master Leninism, improve the ideological armament of the Soviet people, promote the feelings of Soviet patriotism, and consolidate this feeling in the consciousness of every Soviet citizen.

Stalin, like Lenin, constantly called on the Soviet people to consolidate discipline, system, and organization based on the high consciousness and political education of the masses.

Stalin taught Soviet soldiers to sacredly fulfill the military oath, which is permeated with the great idea of defending the world's first Soviet socialist country.

Stalin, like Lenin, constantly taught us to infinitely love the motherland, infinitely loyal to the Communist Party and the Soviet government, and called on the Soviet people to always be prepared to fight selflessly for the great cause of the victory of communism.

    列宁论军队教育
    Ｈ·菲洛诺夫作
    允一译
    苏联各族人民亲爱的领袖，天才的思想家，伟大的战略家，布尔什维克党的组织者和领导者，世界上第一个苏维埃社会主义国家的创始者——列宁的逝世，已经二十四周年了。
    列宁巨大的广泛的政治活动，给予了我们整个这一时代的强烈的影响。列宁的伟大战友——斯大林继承了列宁的事业，为整个先进与进步人类谋幸福。
    列宁的思想遗产，是伟大而不可估价的。在内战时期，在我国为建设社会主义而斗争的诸年和伟大卫国战争时期，我们在列宁的学说里吸取了力量。这个学说也给我们照明了在现阶段为从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义而斗争的道路。
        ×  ×          ×
    斯大林同志在其所创立的先进苏维埃军事科学和军事思想的完整体系中，发展了列宁对于军事问题，对于以无限忠心保卫我们社会主义祖国的精神来对苏维埃人民及其武装力量进行军队教育问题的最宝贵的指示。
    列宁和斯大林明确地刻划了必须培养我们军人所具有的那些精神的战斗的品质，这就是指的对一个现代军人的要求。
    斯大林同志一九四一年七月三日在其有历史意义的广播演说中指出：“创造了我们国家的伟大列宁曾经说过，苏维埃人们主要的品质应当是在斗争中英勇果敢，不怕一切，决心与人民一起作战反对我们祖国的敌人。必须使布尔什维克底这个优秀品质，成为我们红军和红海军，以及苏联所有各族人民千百万人所具有的品质”。
    苏维埃人民在伟大卫国战争中这个具有全世界历史意义的胜利，乃是布尔什维克党教育工作巨大成就底先辉标帜。苏维埃武装力量的胜利，是与完全优越于德国法西斯军队的教育体系分不开的。
      ×    ×    ×
    从苏维埃政权存在的第一天起，列宁和斯大林就开展了巨大工作，来建立苏维埃国家的武装力量，建立新型的军队，已获得解放的工农军队；这个军队是以我国各族人民间的友谊和无产阶级国际主义的精神教育出来的。同时它们是从这样一个事实出发，即我们不单是生活在一个国家里，而是生活在许多国家的体系中，苏维埃人民要在资本主义包围的条件下建成共产主义。列宁教导我们说：“……统治阶级，无产者，假使它想要和将要实行统治，也应以自己的军事组织来证明这一点……”（列宁全集，第二四卷，第一二二页——第三版）。
    这就是为什么列宁把军队教育视为人民共产主义教育的最重要的部分。这一点就确定了苏维埃军队教育的特点。这些特点也是从苏维埃国家武装力量的特别任务，从我们军队与资产阶级军队的原则区别产生出来的。
    苏维埃军队教育，是有系统和有目的的改造苏维埃军人的意识、性格和体质，来发展他们作为世界上第一个社会主义国家的保卫者所应具备的品质。
    德国法西斯的及其他任何反动的士兵教育原则，是基于强迫纪律、使士兵脱离政治生活和极力把他们变成无灵魂的机器，与此相反，苏维埃军队教育的最重要的原则，是培养自觉的纪律，让士兵积极参加国内政治生活，极力使全体苏维埃军人都成为了解我们伟大解放目的和任务的自觉战士。
    列宁关于这点说道：
    “在十八世纪，一个普鲁士国王说出了这样一句聪明的话：‘假使我们的士兵懂得我们是为什么而战，那末任何一个战争都进行不了’。这个普鲁士的老朽国王，不是一个愚笨人。我们把自己的情况与这个国王的情况比较一下时，现在可以充分地说：我们是能够进行战争的，因为群众知道他们是为什么而战，他们愿意战争，尽管是空前的灾难——我再重复地说，现在战争的灾难比起沙皇时还严重，——他们知道遭到这种不能忍受的严重牺牲，是为保卫自己社会主义的事业……”（列宁全集，第二四卷，第六二页）。
    斯大林同志讲到红军三个特点时如下地表现了这一思想：“……知道为什么而战的军队，是不可战胜的”。伟大卫国战争的结局，完全证实了这一个结论。
    由此可见，应当根据苏维埃军队的教育体系，进行不断的工作，来提高群众的政治觉悟，宣传列宁、斯大林党的正义的高尚的思想。
    政治教育，首先有助于在人民中发扬和巩固苏维埃爱国主义的情感。苏维埃爱国主义，这是新的最高类型的爱国主义：它不是分裂，相反的，是团结我国一切民族于一个战斗的大家庭里。应当把这看成是苏联各族人民不可摧毁的友谊的基础。
    英勇的苏维埃人民，在列宁、斯大林党的领导之下，把我国变成了走在资本主义前面整个历史时代的先进社会主义强国。苏维埃人民对人类的最伟大的历史功绩，是在苏联消灭了资本主义，建立了劳动人民的政权，建成了社会主义，并从法西斯强盗的蹂躏下拯救了世界文明。因此，在苏维埃社会里，爱国主义的情感已成为苏维埃民族自豪的表现。自然，对苏维埃民族自豪的宣传，是与反对缺乏思想性的和阿谀没落的资产阶级文化的斗争分不开的。
    在苏维埃爱国主义的基础上，发挥了苏维埃军人高度的精神的战斗的品质。
    一九三七年十二月十一日，斯大林同志在向莫斯科斯大林选举区的选民演讲时，描绘出了列宁式的政治活动家的形象。他说列宁是一个思想明确而坚定的人，在战斗中有大无畏的精神，对人民公敌毫不留情，善于克服任何类似慌乱的现象，在解决复杂问题时，非常英明镇定，正直忠诚和热爱自己的人民。所有这些优秀的列宁的品质，在斯大林同志的身上都充分地表现出来了。列宁的形象，斯大林的形象，就是苏维埃军人的理想。列宁和斯大林的传记，给了我们最丰富的材料来进行军队教育，来培养我们祖国保卫者所必须的高度的精神的战斗的品质。研究他们的传记，乃是群众共产主义教育的一个最有效的方法。
      ×      ×    ×
    苏维埃军队教育的最重要的任务，是想尽一切办法巩固军队的纪律性、制度和组织性。
    列宁自身就是党和军事纪律的模范，并以这一精神教育了布尔什维克党，我们的人民和苏维埃军队。
    列宁对稍许松懈和疲塌的现象是绝不能容忍的。在困难的时期，当年青的苏维埃国家处在危机之时，列宁的要求是特别严厉而无情的。在战争时期，列宁要求苏维埃公民的一切生活都要服从于国防的任务。斯大林同志在其一九四三年“五一”命令中，着重地指出了列宁的这个遗言：
    “我们要记住伟大列宁的遗言：‘既然战争成了必不可免的——就要把一切都用之于战争，稍许松懈和缺乏毅力，都应按战时的法律来惩办’”。
    列宁要求不惜采用严格而坚决的手段，来为建立前后方的纪律、制度和组织性而斗争。列宁就战胜高尔察克在致工人和农民的信中写道：
    “谁不全心全意地帮助红军，谁不尽一切力量维护红军中的制度和纪律，那他就是叛徒和卖国贼，他就是高尔察克的拥护者，这种人就应当无情地处决”（列宁全集，第二四卷，第四三二页）。
    为了保卫人民的利益，列宁总是同一切不坚决的和无信心的现象作斗争。他痛恨犹豫、怯懦和软弱无能的人，这种人很容易叛变。列宁指出，一个软弱无能的叛徒与一个别有企图和打算的叛徒之间，在政治上没有区别。
    列宁要布尔什维克灌输每个苏维埃军人以这一意识：要迅速胜利的结束战争，就要靠他们的勇敢、坚定和忠诚。同时列宁要求无情的镇压胆怯分子，惊慌失措分子和临阵脱逃分子。
    “枪毙——这就是在战时对胆怯分子的法律制裁。”（列宁全集，第二四卷，第三一六页）。
    苏维埃军队纪律的特点，即是它依靠于我们军人的爱国主义，依靠于他们觉悟到保卫祖国是自己的天职。
    列宁极其敬重人民，并在其对群众的演讲中，经常提到他们的自觉性。列宁从来在他们面前不掩饰困难。相反的，他真实地说明情况，要求动员一切力量来克服困难。
    在内战的年份里，列宁着重地指出，战争在半途中止是没有可能的，要不是我们胜利，就是帝国主义者和白军胜利。因此列宁的口号是：“或者死亡，或者胜利！”
    例如，列宁在对开赴前线的斯维尔得洛夫大学的学生讲演中说道：“对那些开赴前线的人来说，他们是工人和农民的代表，没有任何别的选择。他们的口号应当是——或者死亡，或者胜利”（列宁全集，第二四卷，第四九九页）。
    一九一八年秋，列宁在中央致全体党员的信中指出：“全体红军部队要认识到，这是有关工人阶级生死存亡的问题，因此不能有任何松懈现象。指挥员只有一个选择：或者胜利，或者死亡……”（列宁全集，第三四卷，第四五页）。
    列宁把为了获得胜利而有视死如归的精神，认为是一个最重要的军人品质。关于这个品质，列宁早在伟大十月社会主义革命以前就写过。例如，列宁在一九○五年莫斯科暴动之后写道：“我们要记住，伟大的群众斗争来临了……群众应当知道，他们将要走上武装的、流血的和生死的斗争。要在群众中宣传视死如归的精神，并且保证胜利”（列宁全集，第十卷，第五三页）。
    列宁特别注意提高警惕性的教育，特别注意严格保守国家和军事秘密。他教导苏维埃的人们，在整个自己工作的地区，特别是在军队和军事目标地方，要时刻警惕。
    列宁要求严惩那些以自己爱扯乱蛋和信口开河泄露国家和军事秘密帮助了敌人的人。
    由于白军向彼得格勒进攻，一九一九年五月，列宁在以“严防奸细！肃清奸细！”为题的演讲中，号召一切有觉悟的工人和农民，特别是铁路员工和政工人员，起来同奸细和破坏者作斗争。“处处要提高警惕，多想办法和以最严厉的手段搜查奸细和白党，并加以逮捕”。
    列宁和斯大林着重指出，特别是在胜利之后，必须要有高度的警惕性。斯大林同志在其对列宁的回忆里说道：“……正是在胜利之后，他特别警惕和小心谨慎”（列宁、斯大林一卷选集，一九三六年莫斯科版，第五页）。列宁之有这种作风，是因为他深刻了解阶级敌人的阴谋鬼计。
    列宁教导我们，要把斗争进行到完全歼灭敌人为止。
    列宁在“向彼得格勒工人致敬”的文章里指出尤登尼奇的军队已被粉碎并在败退时号召说：
    “工人同志们，红军同志们！
    你们要集中一切力量！无论如何要追击退却的军队，歼灭他们，不给他们有一小时一分钟喘息的机会。现在我们完全可能而且应当尽一切力量进行突击，以便消灭敌人”（列宁全集，第二四卷，第五一六页）。
    在列宁内战时期的许多命令中，都严格要求把战争进行到底，彻底歼灭白军和粉碎外国武装干涉者。
    斯大林同志在伟大卫国战争时期写道：“红军战士们，指挥员们和政工人员们，你们要牢牢记住我们的导师列宁的遗训：‘第一件事，不要为胜利冲昏头脑，勿骄勿躁，第二件事，要巩固胜利，第三件事，要歼灭敌人’”（斯大林“论苏维埃人民伟大的卫国战争”，第八四页）。
    列宁特别注意对苏维埃军人的荣誉与尊严的培养。苏维埃军人的荣誉，首先要求他履行军人誓词，并想尽办法保持为全体人民努力所取得的红军的高度的战斗力。
    列宁要求我们的军队要不断的改进作战。列宁早在一九一八年就批准了“红军战士服务手册”，其中包含了以履行军人誓词和伟大俄罗斯统帅苏沃罗夫“胜利科学”一书中的坚韧不拔的精神去在政治上军事上教育我们战士的基本指示。因此，红军战士手册宣传了俄国军队的最好的战斗传统。在这个手册里，亦详尽地叙述了指战员的基本职责，这大大地补充了队列条令和野战条令之不足。
    ×  ×  ×
    斯大林同志是列宁事业的有资格的继承者。在我们党和人民中，都正直地说：“斯大林，他就是今日的列宁”。
    斯大林同志亦如列宁一样，不断地教育苏维埃人民及其武装力量，必须经常作战斗准备。斯大林同志教导我们说：
    “必须记住伟大列宁的指示，转入和平劳动时，要经常警惕，象保护自己的眼珠一样来保护我国武装力量和国防力”（斯大林，一九四六年五月一日苏联武装力量部的命令，一九四六年国家出版局出版，第八——九页）。
    斯大林亦如列宁一样教导我们，不要满足于已获得的成绩，在军事和政治教育上，每日要努力争取新的更高的成就。巩固和平的事业要求我们这样作，保证我国安全的事业要求我们这样作。
    斯大林经常教导我们要提高革命的警惕，号召精通列宁主义，提高苏维埃人民的思想武装，发扬苏维埃爱国主义的情感，在每一个苏维埃公民的意识中巩固这种情感。
    斯大林亦如列宁一样，不断地号召苏维埃人民巩固以群众的高度觉悟和政治教育为基础的纪律、制度和组织性。
    斯大林教导苏维埃军人，要神圣地履行军人誓词，这一誓词浸透了保卫世界上第一个苏维埃社会主义国家的伟大思想。
    斯大林亦如列宁一样，经常教导我们，无限热爱祖国，无限忠于共产党和苏维埃政府，号召苏维埃人们要经常准备为共产主义胜利的伟大事业而奋不顾身地斗争。
