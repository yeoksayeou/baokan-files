　　Taiyuan Area Two Thousand Administrative Villages
  　Universally Establish People's Political Power
    In the Future, We Must Continue to Mobilize the Masses and Strengthen the Education of Village Cadres
    [Taiyuan News] The Taiyuan Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Bureau convened the first Civil Affairs Section Chiefs' Conference in the Taiyuan area on the 6th of this month to review the political construction work of the past year and discuss future work guidelines. The meeting pointed out that the political construction in the year since liberation has achieved considerable success. In the Taiyuan area, we have basically smashed the reactionary grassroots organizations of the Yan Xishan bandit gang and initially established our own people's political power. Out of a total of 3,414 administrative villages in the area, including 914 administrative villages in the semi-old liberated areas and 1,046 administrative villages in the new liberated areas, all have replaced the Yan bandit's three-person groups (i.e., the pseudo village chiefs, instructors, and Comrades Association special commissioners) and formed people's political power. Among the new liberated areas, the political power in 962 administrative villages has undergone thorough transformation. In the 1,454 administrative villages in the old liberated areas, 983 administrative villages have better established people's representative conferences. In terms of disaster relief, the newly liberated areas after the Jinzhong Campaign, due to the disasters caused by the Yan bandit's plunder, many areas became no-man's-lands, coupled with disasters such as floods, droughts, hailstorms, and insects, the disaster situation was very serious. The government, on the one hand, regulated green crops, and on the other hand, issued relief grain, issuing a total of 800,000 jin of grain. It also launched a "save a handful of rice" movement, implemented production for self-salvation, and mass mutual assistance, and finally the entire area overcame the famine. The work of supporting the military has gradually improved. The methods of land cultivation on behalf of soldiers' families generally adopted three types: fixed contracted cultivation, contracted labor, and temporary allocation of labor, which solved the difficulties in the production of martyrs' and military dependents. They generally reflected that this year was better than last year. However, there are still many shortcomings in the work. The organizational forms of village political power are not unified, and the village political system has not been implemented. Some places believe that the people's representative conference is a temporary organization during the land reform. In terms of village cadres, some cadres in the old liberated areas are becoming corrupt while relying on their old qualifications, or they are lying down and not working due to certain biases generated during party rectification. Cadres in the new liberated areas dare not act boldly and have a commanding style. In the work of supporting the military, the masses have not been mobilized to automatically support the military, and the phenomena of "people are generous when someone is around," "giving preference to the living over the dead," and "giving preference to the near over the far" have not been completely overcome. Therefore, further improving the village political power, strengthening the education of village cadres, and continuing to mobilize the masses to improve the masses' awareness will be the important work in the future.

　　太原区两千个行政村
  　普建人民政权
    今后要继续发动群众加强村干部教育
    【太原讯】太原市府民政局于本月六日召开太原区首次民政科长会议，检查一年来的建政工作，及讨论今后工作方针。会议指出：解放后一年来建政是有相当成绩的。在太原区我已基本上打垮了阎匪的反动基层组织，初步建立了人民自己的政权。全区共行政村三千四百十四个，其中半老区九百十四个行政村，新区一千零四十六个行政村，已全部撤换了阎匪三人小组（即伪村长、指导员、同志会特派员），组成人民的政权。新区中并有九百六十二个行政村的政权，经过澈底改造。老区一千四百五十四个行政村中，有九百八十三个行政村，较好地建立了人民代表会。救灾方面，晋中战役后的新解放区，在阎匪掠夺而造成的灾害上，不少地区变成了无人区，又加上水旱雹虫等灾，灾情很严重。政府一面调剂青苗，一面颁发救济粮，先后发粮八十万斤，并展开节约一把米运动、实行生产自救、群众五济等办法，终于全区渡过灾荒。优军工作上，是逐渐进步的。代耕方法大致采取了固定包耕、包工及临时拨工三种，解决了烈、军属生产中的困难，他们一般反映今年比去年好。但工作上缺点还很多，村政权组织形式不统一，村政制度未贯彻，有的地方认为人代会是土改时的临时组织。村干部方面，老区干部中，有一部分在摆老资格逐渐腐化起来，或因整党中产生某些偏向而躺倒不干，新区干部不敢大胆干，有命令作风。优军工作上，没发动群众自动起来优军，“人在人情在”、“优生不优死”、“优近不优远”的现象，还未完全克服。故进一步健全村政权，加强对村干部教育，继续发动群众提高群众觉悟，自为今后的重要工作。
