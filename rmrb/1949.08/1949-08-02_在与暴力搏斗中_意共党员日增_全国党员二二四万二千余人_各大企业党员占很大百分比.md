    In the Struggle Against Violence
    Membership in the Italian Communist Party Increases Daily
    National Membership Exceeds 2,242,000
    Party Members Account for a Large Percentage in Major Enterprises
    However, despite this atmosphere of persecution, violence, and bullying, the work of registering and collecting membership dues is still achieving good results. The total number of party members on December 31, 1948, was 2,115,230, and by June 30, 1949, it had increased to 2,242,719, including 214,677 members of the Communist Youth League.
    Xie Jiaji (likely a transliteration of someone's name) stated: In 1944, less than half of the regions in the country had Communist Party branches, but today, there are very few places without them. Communist Party branches are particularly strong and powerful in Italy's major industrial and agricultural centers. In Emilia, there are 440,000 Communist Party members, accounting for 19 percent of the region's population. In Tuscany, there are 300,000 Communist Party members, accounting for 14 percent of the region's population, and in Lombardy, there are 350,000 Communist Party members, accounting for 8.5 percent of the region's population.
    Xie Jia pointed out: A significant percentage of employees in the country's largest industrial enterprises are Communist Party members. For example, in the Montecatini and Motomeccanica factories in Milan, party members account for 47 percent of the workforce; in the Alfa Romeo factory, they account for 35 percent; and in the Breda and Caproni factories, they account for 30 percent.
    In trade union elections, 70 to 80 percent of the personnel in these and other enterprises vote for Communist candidates.
    Xie Jia declared: "In this situation, pursuing an anti-communist policy like the Gasperi cabinet is tantamount to a completely insane attempt to destroy one of the cornerstones of the country's entire economic, social, and cultural life; it represents an attempt to restore fascism."
    Xie Jia finally addressed the shortcomings of the Party's work and that of some local Party organizations, especially the main shortcomings—the uneven development of the Party in various provinces and regions, as well as the task of ideologically strengthening the Party and training cadres.
    Xie Jia said: "In the face of the danger that is once again engulfing the world and our people, it is the responsibility of the Communists to more firmly strengthen the Party's ranks and the Party's ties with the masses; because each of us should be clear that Italy's future mainly depends on the Communist Party's ability to act as the leading force of the entire democratic movement and all the Italian working people.
    Ahead of us is a period of arduous and persistent struggle to safeguard freedom and peace, a period that, as Comrade Togliatti said, may continue for an indefinite long time; the enemy is zealously trying to realize its reactionary plans to return to the past.
    These plans will never be realized, not due to some mysterious force of destiny, but because democracy and freedom will be saved by the struggle of the Italian working people, the Communist Party, and the democratic forces of the country!"

### 在与暴力搏斗中  意共党员日增  全国党员二二四万二千余人  各大企业党员占很大百分比

    在与暴力搏斗中
    意共党员日增
    全国党员二二四万二千余人
    各大企业党员占很大百分比
    但是，尽管是在这种迫害、暴力和霸道的气氛中，登记和征收党员的工作，仍然获得良好的成绩。党员总数在一九四八年十二月三十一日是二百一十一万五千二百三十人，到一九四九年六月三十日增加到二百二十四万二千七百一十九人，其中包括共产主义青年团团员二十一万四千六百七十七人。
    谢嘉继称：在一九四四年，全国只有不到半数的地区有共产党支部，但在今天，没有共产党支部的地方就很少了。共产党支部在意大利主要的工业与农业中心特别强而有力。在艾米利亚有四十四万共产党员，占该地区人数的百分之十九。在杜斯坎尼有三十万共产党员，占该地区人数的百分之十四，在伦巴多有三十五万共产党员，占该地区人数的百分之八点五。
    谢嘉指出：在国家最大工业企业的雇员中，有颇大的百分比是共产党员。例如：在米兰的芒提伐丁和莫托机械工厂中，党员人数占百分之四十七，在阿尔法——罗米欧工厂中占百分之三十五，在布累达和卡普隆尼工厂中占百分之三十。
    在职工会选举时，这些企业和其他企业中有百分之七八十的人员投票选举共产党的候选人。
    谢嘉宣称：“在这种情况下，象加斯贝利内阁那样奉行反共的政策，就表示完全疯狂地企图毁坏国家整个经济、社会和文化生活的柱石之一，就表示企图恢复法西斯主义。”
    谢嘉最后论及党和一些地方党组织工作的缺点，特别是主要的缺点——党在各省各区中发展之不平衡，以及在思想上加强党和训练干部的任务。
    谢嘉说：“在再度笼罩世界和我们人民的危险面前，更坚定地加强党的队伍和党与群众的联系，乃是共产党人的责任；因为，我们每一个人都应该清楚，意大利的前途，主要要依靠共产党作为整个民主运动、全体意大利劳动人民的领导力量的能力。
    在我们面前，是一段艰苦和坚持斗争以维护自由与和平的时期，这样的一个时期，正如托格里亚蒂同志所说的，可能继续一个不确定的长时间，敌人正热中于设法实现其回到过去时代的反动计划。
    这些计划决不会实现，这不是由于某种神秘的命运的力量，而是由于民主和自由将为意大利劳动人民、共产党和国家的民主力量的斗争所拯救！”
