　　Traveling Companion
　　By Panova
　　(Translated from Russian by Panova, revised by Cao Jinghua)

　　Part One: Night
　　Chapter One: Danilov

　　"I know. I'm going to be a medic."
　　"Go on with you," he said. "This line of work needs strong people."
　　She laughed again, quickly bending down, grabbed his calf, and he felt like she had lifted him up. Not much when she lifted, but she always lifted him up.
　　"Amazing," he said. "Amazing, really amazing."
　　She stood up straight, not even breathing hard.
　　"What's your name?" he asked.
　　"Lina."

　　The hardest to get were the skilled technicians. The power generation drivers and electrical technicians were all snatched away from Danilov. The transportation authorities were unwilling to allocate repair workers, telling Danilov, "Just deal with it as it is, anyway, it'll come to us for repairs in the future."

　　The train itself had not yet been released from the repair yard. The commander was waiting to organize the train. The resident doctor, Suprunov, refused to take on the task.
　　"Comrades, I'm just a nobody," he said.

　　He was very polite, laughing at every joke, eagerly offering cigarettes. It felt like there was an uneasy look in his heart – it seemed that the heart within this thin, casually dressed man was troubled, he was absent-minded.

　　Danilov ate and slept at home. His wife greeted him with a silent, helpless look. He didn't want to say anything to her. She could see that he had dedicated his whole heart to his new endeavor. It was like before at the state farm, and later at the trust, now he was handling the ambulance train work with the same spirit. This heart had never been at home. Only his son was on his mind. His wife silently served Danilov food and made the bed. In the past three days, her face had become thinner and less pretty. At night, she couldn't help it and began to murmur:
　　"Mekulov was exempted from military service, the chief accountant was exempted, even someone like Grigoriev was exempted..."
　　"What?" he asked, suppressing his anger, pretending to be indifferent. "Oh, exempted from military service, that's good, but what about the future?"
　　"You don't pity anyone. You don't pity me, you don't pity the child, you don't pity anyone."
　　He turned over.
　　"Okay, I want to sleep."

　　He buried himself in his new work, almost forgetting the trust. On the twenty-sixth, he took two hours to go to Mekulov to hand over affairs. He turned onto a familiar alley. He saw a black signboard with gold letters, which read: "Dairy Products Trust." There was a small crack on the lower right corner of the signboard, which had been there when he came here to take over the position. The familiar stairs, the abacus ringing in the accounting office, the computer creaking. The door on the left covered in black oilcloth... that was his door. That was the trust he worked for.

　　After handing over to Mekulov, he went to each office to say goodbye to all the staff. An old woman who worked as a cashier cried. Her crying made him feel quite happy. She sniffled and said:
　　"Did you hear that they took our car away? Mekulov is taking the train to the district tomorrow, can you imagine that?"

　　Everyone except Mekulov was sad to see him go. Danilov could see that Mekulov was happy. Of course, he wasn't happy because he had become the manager; he wasn't that kind of person. He was just happy to be in a position of independent activity, feeling free... Did Danilov hinder him?

　　After leaving the trust, Danilov went to find Potabenko. Standing in front of Potabenko was a little old man in his fifties, gesturing and saying something. As soon as Potabenko saw Danilov, he said:
　　"Come, let me introduce you, this is Dr. Bilov, your ambulance train commander."

　　Danilov glanced at the commander: he was truly unremarkable! Short stature, small, thin face. The commander hadn't had time to change into military uniform yet: wearing suit trousers, small leather shoes, oh my! my! my! How could he work with such a person?

　　As soon as Potabenko saw Danilov, he said: "Come, let me introduce you, this is Dr. Bilov, your ambulance train commander."

    第一部　夜
    第一章　达尼洛夫
    “我知道。我去当卫生兵的。”
    “去你的吧，”他说道。“这一行需要有力的人来干呢。”
    她又笑起来，很快的弯下腰，抓住他的小腿肚，他就觉得把他举起来了。举的时候不大，可是总是把他举起来了。
    “了不得，”他说。“了不得，真了不得。”
    她笔直的站着，并不气喘。
    “你叫么名字？”他问着。
    “琳娜。”
    最难得到的是专门技术人员。发电司机和电气技师，都被人从达尼洛夫的手边夺走了。运输当局不愿拨修理工人，他们对达尼洛夫说：“你就这样对付吧，反正将来要到我们这儿来修理的。”
    列车本身还没有从修理场开出来。司令都在等着组织列车。常务医生苏普鲁戈夫拒绝担负这项任务了。
    “同志们，我只是一个无名小卒，”他说道。
    他很客气，任何笑话他都会笑起来，爱强请人抽香烟。觉得他心里有种不安的神情，——看来这瘦弱的穿着便服的体内的一颗心，是在忧愁着，他是心不在焉呵。
    达尼洛夫吃饭睡觉都是回家的。太太带着沈默的不知所措的神情迎着他。他什么也不愿对她说。她看出来他已经把全付心血都奉献给自己的新事业了。这就象从前他在国家农场，以及后来在托辣斯似的，现在以同样的精神，来处理救护列车的工作。这一颗心从来没有在家里过。家里只有儿子在他心上。太太不言不语的给达尼洛夫端着饭，铺着床。这三天来她脸变瘦了，变得不漂亮了。夜间她忍不住了，开始咕哝起来：
    “梅库洛夫免兵役了，会计主任免兵役了，甚至连格里戈里耶夫那样的人，也都免兵役了……”
    “什么？”他压着气，装着淡然漠然的样子问道。“呵，免了兵役，挺好，可是将来怎么呢？”
    “你谁也不怜念的。不怜念我，也不怜念孩子，谁也不怜念的。”
    他翻过身去。
    “得了，我想睡觉的。”
    他埋头于新的工作里，几乎把托辣斯忘掉了。二十六日那天，他抽了两小时工夫，去向梅库洛夫办理交代。他转到一条熟悉的胡同里。看见一块金字的黑招牌，上边写着：“乳品托辣斯”。招牌的右边下角上，有一道小裂缝，这当他来到这儿接任的时候就有了。熟悉的楼梯，算盘在会计室里响着，计算机在吱吱的响着。＠着黑油布的左边的门……这是他的门。就是他所供职的托辣斯。
    他对梅库洛夫移交以后，就到各办公室走了一趟，对所有人员告别了。一位当出纳员的老太婆哭了。她这哭却令他很畅快。她擤着鼻涕说：
    “人家把我们的汽车弄走了，你听说了吗？梅库洛夫明天坐火车到区里去，８你能想得到吗？”
    除了梅库洛夫以外，大家都很心痛他走。达尼洛夫看出来梅库洛夫是高兴的。当然，他高兴的并不是因为他做了经理；他不是这种人。他只是高兴着爬到独立活动的地位，觉到自由了………难道达尼洛夫妨碍了他吗？
    达尼洛夫由托辣斯出来，就去找波塔宾珂去了。在波塔宾珂跟前站着一个五十来岁的小老头，指手画脚的在说着什么事。波塔宾珂一看见达尼洛夫就说：
    “来吧，让我来介绍介绍，这就是你们的救护列车司令比洛夫医生。”
    达尼洛夫对司令看了一眼：真是其貌不扬呵！矮身个，小瘦脸。司令还没来得及换上军服的：穿着西装裤，小皮鞋，呵呀！呀！呀！跟这样人怎么办呢？
    波塔宾珂一看见达尼洛夫就说：“来吧，让我来介绍介绍，这就是你们的救护列车司令比洛夫医生。”
