　　The Fellow Traveler
　　By Soviet writer Panova, translated by Su Ling, proofread by Cao Jinghua

　　Part One: Night

　　Chapter One: Danilov

　　Suprunov raised his timid eyes. Danilov's gold tooth glinted in the gray night. Suprunov wore a stern face.

　　"I don't understand," he said quickly and agitatedly in another tone. "A train like this going to the front line is simply sabotage. Pena says that as soon as the first explosion occurs, all the windows will be blown out."

　　"Is that the Pena?"

　　"The head nurse."

　　"Her name is Pena?" The forgotten scent of damp, heavy, and soft woman's hair was evoked by the name. You think well. It's been almost twenty years. Yes, twenty-two years. The head nurse had her hair cut short and curled like sheep's wool. Where did Pena go?

　　"This is indeed sabotage," Suprunov said, desperately puffing on a cigarette.

　　"What do you suggest we do?" Danilov's muscles trembled. If Suprunov looked closely, he might have seen the anger in his bright eyes. But Suprunov was busy fiddling with his cigarette, which had somehow gone out, probably because the rolling paper was torn.

　　"Do you turn the valve? Do you send a telegram to Kaganovich [Note 1]? Do you say, 'Minister Kaganovich, please protect the train, they are driving it under bombs,' like that?"

　　Suprunov understood that he was being mocked. He was very displeased. After all, he wasn't a medic; he was a military doctor.

　　"I have no suggestions. But one can have one's own opinions. I am just as willing to sacrifice myself as you are."

　　"You think so? ... Well, before we die, please allow me to inspect the cars."

　　He smoked, but the cigarette went out again. Suprunov stared at Danilov's back. The commissioner's appearance was truly heroic. Suprunov felt uneasy about his own clothing. Of course, this was his own fault. He shouldn't have started this personal conversation at all. With Pena, and generally with girls, one could go anywhere. But one couldn't do that with a commissioner. One should be alert around such people.

　　All the windows on the right side of the car were open, but it was still very stuffy. The car immediately felt like a newly moved-in family's home. Little mirrors, dolls, and photos of loved ones hung on the girls' shelves. Hopefully, bedbugs wouldn't breed behind these photos of loved ones. One should check.

　　Lina slept on the lower side bunk. She was a ridiculously small woman, very much like a taciturn but secretly gossipy boy. Even when asleep, she had such a face, as if someone was teasing her. The palette-shaped mirror hanging above her head reflected light. That meant this kid also looked in the mirror. Opposite Lina, waving two powerful arms and snoring loudly, was Yiya, whose dear parents had given her such a strange name. These heroic girls all wore men's undershirts or athletic vests; not one of them wore a woman's blouse. The day before yesterday, he had caught Yiya sleeping bare-shouldered; he had given her a push and issued a special order. How outrageous. Girls should be ashamed.

　　The cars carrying the wounded were prepared. The cots covered with blue blankets were neatly arranged. Towels folded into triangles were placed on the flat pillows.

　　The air was filled with the sulfur, whitewash, paint, and other unnamable, elusive odors peculiar to trains and stations. These odors could not be eliminated by paint and disinfection.

　　These hard-berth carriages were all for lightly wounded soldiers. In each carriage, there was a soldier on duty. You only needed to knock on the door, and a black shadow with a rifle would greet you, a cigarette glowing in his mouth.

　　Smoking was prohibited in the carriages, but Danilov had never reprimanded a single guard. People weren't machines. The train was heading to the front line, like a flag, marked with red crosses. No one in the train hoped that these red crosses would become their amulets. Everyone knew that the enemy would target the red cross cars.

　　Note 1: Kaganovich was the Minister of Military Industry of the Soviet Union, etc.

    第一部　夜
    第一章　达尼洛夫
    苏普鲁戈夫抬起怯懦的眼睛。达尼洛夫的金牙，在灰白的夜色里闪烁着。苏普鲁戈夫板着严峻的面孔。
    “我不明白，”他飞快而动气的用另一种口气说。“这样的列车往前线开，这简直是破坏行为。裴娜说，一遇到头一声爆炸，所有的窗子都要飞去了的。”
    “是那位裴娜？”
    “看护长。”
    “她叫裴娜吗？”被遗忘的那股湿润的，沉重而柔和的女人头发的气味，叫这个名字引起来了。你可想得好。这几乎是二十多年以前的事了。是的，二十二年了。看护长是剪发的，头发卷得象绵羊似的。裴娜上那儿去了呵。
    “这确实是破坏行为，”苏普鲁戈夫说着，拚命的抽起烟来。
    “你说叫怎么办呢？”达尼洛夫的筋肉都抖颤起来。如果苏普鲁戈夫仔细看一下的话，那他许在他的明亮的眼睛里，看出那股愤怒呢。可是苏普鲁戈夫正忙着弄他的纸烟呢，那纸烟不知怎的灭了，大概是卷烟的纸筒破了。
    “你把活栓搬转过来吗？你给卡干诺维奇（注一）打快电吗？你说，‘卡部长，请你保护火车吧，人家把火车往炸弹下赶呢，’这样吗？”
    苏普鲁戈夫明白都在嘲笑他。他很不是味了。他究竟不是卫生兵，他是军医阿。
    “我什么意见也没有。可是能够有自己的意见。我同你一样去忠实的牺牲呢。”
    “你想的吗？……唔，怎么呢，趁我们还没有死，请允许我去察车吧。”
    他吸着烟，可是那枝烟又灭了，苏普鲁戈夫盯着达尼洛夫的背后。委员的仪容真是英武的。苏普鲁戈夫对自己的衣罩感到不安了。当然，这是他自己的错。压根儿就不该扯起这私人的谈话呢。跟裴娜，以及一般说来，跟姑娘们还可以到处走一走。可是委员是一点也不能够的，跟这种人在一块，耳朵应该放机警呢。
    全车里右边的车窗都开着，可是依然闷热得很。马上车里就好象新迁来的一个家庭似的。姑娘们的橱架上挂着小镜子，洋娃娃，和亲人的照片。这些亲人的相片背后，能不生臭虫才好呢。得查看一下呵。
    琳娜睡在下面的边铺上，她是一个可笑的小身个的女子，很象一个沉默寡言，可是悄悄儿爱说长道短的那样的男孩子。就是在睡着的时候，她都是这样一付面孔，就好象有人在逗她笑似的。她头上挂的那面形如调色版的小镜子，射着光芒。那就是说，这小子也照镜子呢。躺在琳娜对面，挥着两只有力的胳膊，大声的打着鼾声的是咦呀，她的亲爱的父母，给自己的女儿起了这样一个怪名字。这些英武的姑娘们，全都一个样儿穿着男子的卫生汗衫或运动员的背心；没有一个人穿女短褂的。前天，他碰到咦呀裸着肩膀睡觉的；他把她推了一把，就特别命令了一番。这是多么放肆啊。姑娘们应该害羞呢。
    载运伤兵的车子预备妥当了。铺着蓝色毛毯的病床，都收拾得整整齐齐的。平展的枕头上，放着叠成三角形的毛巾。
    发着一股火车和车站上特有的硫磺，石灰水，油漆，以及那些叫不出名字的难于捉摸的气味，这些气味是油漆和消毒所消除不了的。
    这些硬板铺的车厢，全是为轻伤的兵士用的。每一辆车厢里，都有一位兵士在值班。你只消把门一敲，就会有一个带着步枪的黑影迎上来，他口里噙着的纸烟，在闪着小火光。
    在车厢里是禁止吸烟的，可是达尼洛夫连一个值班的都不曾叱责过。人不是一架机器呵。火车往前线开着，好象旗帜似的，上边标着红色的十字。车里没有一个人希望着这些红十字，会成了他们的护身符。每个人都知道敌人就是要对着红十字车打呢。
    注一：卡干诺维奇，曾任苏联军工业部长等职。
