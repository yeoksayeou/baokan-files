　　Tianjin National Bank Handles Domestic Import and Export Advance Payments
　　Service Already Available Between Tianjin and Shanghai
　　Bank of China Also Piloting Overseas Purchasing Loans
　　[Tianjin News] In order to further promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and between ports, the Tianjin National Bank has begun handling import and export advance payment services between Shanghai and Tianjin. Any public or private enterprise in the city that handles domestic goods sales and needs working capital can apply to the relevant bank departments. The annual limit is temporarily set at 30 million yuan, and can be adjusted at any time based on actual needs. To coordinate with the professional nature of each bank department, the types of inter-port advance payments have also been specifically allocated: the Bank of China handles advance payments for export goods and domestic sales of mountain products; the Bank of Communications handles advance payment business for industrial finished products, equipment, and raw materials (excluding grain); the Cooperatives Department handles export advance payments for salt; and the People's Bank of China's business department handles grain sales and any items not within the scope of the above bank departments. In addition to Shanghai, the bank is also negotiating inland export advance payment business with its correspondent banks in more than 30 cities, including Hankou, Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, and Hangzhou.
　　[Further News] Since the Bank of China in this city began offering inter-port import advance payments, it has played a certain role in facilitating the flow of local products and promoting exports. However, the local product areas are spread throughout North China, covering a vast area, and the People's Bank of China's institutions in various places have not yet been universally established, and even if they have institutions, they cannot immediately launch advance payment business. In order to encourage exporters to go directly to the local product areas to purchase, the Bank of China, in addition to inter-port import advance payment business, has recently presented a proposal to the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China to launch a type of overseas purchasing loan. Those who need working capital to purchase local products in the inland areas will be given full consideration in terms of interest rates and terms. After purchasing from the inland areas, the goods can be transported to Tianjin and converted into raw goods or packaging loans. This method will undoubtedly be more conducive to further supporting exports and stimulating inland production. The Bank of China has officially started handling this business.

　　津市国家银行办理国内进出口押汇
  　津沪间业已开始办理
    中国银行并试办赴外采购贷款
    【天津讯】本市国家银行为进一步促进城乡、埠际间物资交流，已开始办理上海天津间的进出口押汇业务。凡本市公私企业办理国内货物运销业务，需用周转资金者，均可向有关行部申请办理。每年限额暂以三千万元为标准，根据事实需要得随时伸缩。为了配合各行部专业性质，埠际押汇的种类，也作了具体分配：凡运销出口物资及销行国内的山货押汇，由中国银行办理；工业成品、器材及原料（粮食除外）的押汇业务，统由交通银行办理；合作部办理食盐出口押汇；粮食运销及不属以上各行部办理范围之内者，统由人民银行营业部办理。又除上海之外，现该行正与汉口、太原、郑州、杭州等三十多个城市的联行进行协议内地出口押汇业务。
    【又讯】本市中国银行开办埠际进口押汇以来，对疏畅土产来源与推进出口上，已起了一定的作用。但土产区遍及华北各地，范围甚广，而人民银行各地机构还未能普遍建立，即有机构也不能立即开展押汇业务。中行为了鼓励出口商直接赴各土产区采购起见，特在埠际进押业务以外，最近又呈准人民银行天津分行举办赴外采购贷款一种。凡赴内地采购土产物资需要资金周转者，在利率、期限上，皆给以充分照顾。由内地采购后，将货物运来天津，即可转成生货或打包贷款。这一办法，无疑的对进一步扶助出口，刺激内地生产上更加有利。中行现已正式开始办理此项业务。
