    To Facilitate Farmers in Selling Mountain Products
    Jidong District Trading Company Trust Department
    Establishes Mountain Fresh Produce Station
    Business Has Grown Daily in the Last Half-Month
    [Tangshan News] In order to facilitate farmers in the interior of Jidong in selling mountain fresh goods and to prevent manipulation by unscrupulous merchants, the Trust Department of Jidong District Trading Company has established a mountain fresh produce station. Since business began on the 17th of last month, large quantities of apples, crabapples, cantaloupe, and watermelons have been continuously supplied to the market. Farmers who entrust the station to sell their goods only need to have a certificate from the village cadre of their village, proving that they are their own products, to be exempt from paying business tax. After the goods are delivered to the station, farmers can withdraw a portion of the money for expenses in advance and can stay in the station for free. Meals are paid for by the farmers themselves, with options for fine grains and coarse grains, and the price is one-third lower than outside. Meals are served on demand. After the goods are sold, in addition to the tax bureau collecting 1.5% of the total transaction amount as transaction tax, the owner only pays a 2% handling fee to the station (private stations charge 4%). In order for farmers to obtain inexpensive necessities, the Trust Department introduces them to the Grain and Oil Department to buy grain, flour, oil, and salt; for cloth, matches, and other daily necessities, they are introduced to the Department Store. Some farmers who are eager to return home for production leave the goods with the station, and the station can advance money equivalent to a portion of the value of the goods, with the shortfall to be paid next time they come to the station. After the station sells the goods, it immediately hands over the money to the farmers, and the time is also very short. In order to deal well with the farmers, the station's staff have changed their uniforms to ordinary clothes and try their best to take care of customers in their lives. Therefore, it has some old customers shortly after opening. Business is also developing day by day. At the beginning, only a few families brought goods every day, but now it has increased to more than twenty families, with four or five large carts every day. As of the 3rd, 18,000 jin of cantaloupe, more than 1,000 watermelons, and 15,000 jin of crabapples and apples have been sold, with a total transaction amount of more than 7.5 million yuan. However, because the station's location is not ideal, the exchange and the station have not been fully established, farmers do not have a deep understanding of the trust business in their minds, and publicity is insufficient, so it cannot play the expected role. In the future, in addition to taking more care of customers, we should also learn from the advantages of private stations in their operations and improve business at any time.

    便利农民推销山货
    冀东区贸易公司信托部
    成立山鲜货栈
    半月来业务日见开展
    【唐山讯】冀东区贸易公司信托部为便利冀东内地农民推销山鲜货物，免受奸商操纵，建立山鲜货栈，自上月十七日业务开始进行以来，大量苹果、沙果、香瓜、西瓜不断供应市场。委托该栈推销货物的农民，只须备有本村村干的证明文件，证明是自己的出产品，即可免缴行商税；货物入栈交清后，农民可以先支取一部分花销，并可免费居留栈内。伙食由农民自己负担，分细粮粗粮两种，价钱比外面要低三分之一，吃饭随到随开。货物推销后，除由税局按交易总额抽百分之一点五的交易税外，货主只向货栈缴百分之二的手续费（私人货栈收百分之四）。为了使农民得到廉价生活必需品，要买粮食、面、油、盐的，由信托部介绍到油粮部去买；要买布匹、火柴、及其他日用品的，则介绍到百货部去买。有些农民要急于回家搞生产，把货交给栈上后，货栈可以先垫付相当于货价部分的钱，短少的下次到栈来再补交给他。货栈把货物推销后，马上就把款交给农民，时间也很短。为了要好好和农民打交道，货栈工作同志把自己的制服都换成了普通衣服，生活上也尽量照顾顾客，所以开办不久就拥有一些老主顾。业务也一天天发展，开始时每天只有几家货来，现在已增到二十几家，大车每天也有四、五辆。截至三日止已推销香瓜一万八千斤，西瓜一千多个，沙果苹果一万五千斤，交易总额达七十五万余元。但由于该栈地位不适中，交易所和货栈还没有完全建立好，农民对于信托业务思想上没有深刻的认识，加以宣传工作不够，所以还不能发挥预期的作用。今后除了要多多照顾顾客外，还应向私人货栈学习他们经营的优点，随时提高业务。
