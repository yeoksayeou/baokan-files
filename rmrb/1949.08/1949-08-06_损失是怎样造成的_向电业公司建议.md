    How Losses Are Caused
    —Suggestions to the Electric Power Company

    On the 9th of last month, the current transformer of the electric meter in the motor room of the Yanjing Paper Mill was burned out due to a leaky roof during rain. The Yanjing Paper Mill notified the Electric Power Company by telephone and sent a car to pick up repair personnel, but the Electric Power Company did not send anyone to inspect or repair it at that time. The Yanjing Paper Mill was without power for three hours. They repaired the wires themselves and resumed work. The Electric Power Company only sent someone to inspect it three days later. The inspection revealed that only one current transformer was burned out. Because the Yanjing Paper Mill wanted to save time, it was willing to repair the burned-out current transformer itself, still pay the prescribed fee, and have the Electric Power Company send someone to inspect and install it. However, the Electric Power Company did not allow it, saying that their regulations stipulated that if a current transformer was burned out, the user must pay a fine of 10,000 yuan plus a labor cost of 730 yuan, and the transformer must be replaced along with the electric meter. It was not until 11:30 a.m. on July 26th that someone came to replace the electric meter, a gap of eighteen days. Replacing the electric meter required a power outage, but it was during working hours, so the paper mill had to stop all work. The replacement was completed at 1:50 p.m. When testing, the newly replaced two transformers were also burned out. Unable to do anything else, the company installed the original electric meter and used the original transformers, only replacing one current transformer, which was fully functional. By this time, it was already 3:45 p.m.

    Based on the above, we have three suggestions for the Electric Power Company:

    1. We hope that in the future, when the Electric Power Company receives notification of an accident, it should immediately send someone to inspect and repair it to avoid affecting production. This time, the Electric Power Company did not come to inspect until three days later, resulting in a total delay of eighteen days, which is not good.

    2. Unreasonable aspects of the Electric Power Company's regulations should be corrected. The regulations should meet the actual needs of users and should take into account the actual situation and provide appropriate convenience.

    3. The Electric Power Company's system, timing and technology for replacing electric meters should also be reviewed and improved. Changing an electric meter (also due to a new problem) took three hours and forty-five minutes. Our entire factory was shut down, and we produced more than sixty fewer reams of paper. This loss could have been avoided. If they could have accepted our request at the time and only replaced the single current transformer, it would have only taken half an hour. However, the Electric Power Company representative did not accept our request and insisted on replacing the entire electric meter. In the end, they still only replaced the current transformer.

    损失是怎样造成的
    ——向电业公司建议
    上月九日，燕京造纸厂的电机室，因下雨屋漏，电力表的变流器烧毁。经燕京造纸厂以电话通知电业公司，并以汽车往接修理人员，但电业公司当时并未派人来检查与修理。燕京纸厂停电三小时，自己将线修复，恢复工作。电业公司三日后方始派人检查，检查的结果，仅变流器烧断一部。燕京纸厂因为要求时间上的经济，愿自将烧毁了的变流器修好，仍按规定交费，由电业公司派员检查按装，但电业公司不允许，据他们说，他们的制度规定：烧断了变流器，用户须赔款一万元并工资七百三十元，并须与电表同时撤换。到七月二十六日上午十一时三十分，才来人换电表，中间相距十八天，换电表须得停电，可是正在工作时间，纸厂只好全部停止工作，至下午一时五十分装换完备，试验时，又将新换的两个变压器烧毁，该公司无法，遂将原电表按上，仍用原来的变压器，仅换了一个变流器，即已完全能用。这时候已是三点四十五分了。
    按照以上经过，我们对电业公司提出三个意见：
    一、希望以后电业公司接到了事故的通知后，应该立时派人检查与修理，以免影响生产。这次电业公司竟在三日后始来检查，结果共迟延了十八天时间，是不好的。
    二、在电业公司的制度上，不合理的应该纠正，制度要合乎用户的实际需要；并且要酌量实际情形，予以相当的便利。
    三、在换装电表的制度、时间和技术上也应该检讨改进。换了一个电表，（也是由于出了新岔子），费去三点四十五分钟的时间，我们全部停工，少出六十多令纸。这个损失本来可以避免。因为当时如能按照我们的请求，只换一个变流器，只需半小时就够了。可是电业公司的来人，不接受我们的请求，非另换全部电表不可。结果却仍然只换了一个变流器。    （燕京造纸厂）
