    [Ping City News] The Military Commission's Ministry of Railways has decided that, starting today (August 5th), the passenger and freight rates and miscellaneous fees (excluding loading and unloading fees and platform fees) within the jurisdiction of the four Railway Administrations of the Northern Railways, namely Pingjin, Jinan, Taiyuan, and Zhengzhou (excluding the Handan Railway Management Office), and the Hengyang Railway Administration of the Southern Railways (currently located in Hankou), will be increased by 100% based on the current fare rates. The basic passenger fare per kilometer will be changed from 4 yuan to 8 yuan. The fees for special express trains will also be doubled. Ordinary passenger fares from Beiping to Tianjin will be 1120 yuan, Beiping to Taiyuan 5440 yuan, Beiping to Jinan 3680 yuan, Beiping to Zhengzhou 7030 yuan, Beiping to Nanjing 7580 yuan, and Beiping to Shanghai 13500 yuan. In addition, a calculation system for converting the volume of cargo into weight will be implemented. For light and floating goods with a volume of one cubic meter and a weight not exceeding 300 kilograms, the weight will be calculated based on a ratio of 300 kilograms. Fractions of less than 0.01 cubic meters in the calculated volume will be disregarded. If the volume of one cubic meter exceeds 300 kilograms, the actual weight will be used for calculation.
