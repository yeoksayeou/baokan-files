    Iron Industry Worker Representatives
    Gather to Discuss Organizing a Union
    [Our Newspaper] The Industry Workers Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Trade Union Federation convened the first temporary representative meeting of workers in the city's privately-owned machine iron industry yesterday evening (the 9th). Eighty-one representatives from sixty-six factories attended to discuss the establishment of an iron industry union and the drafting of a collective labor-capital contract.
    According to statistics from the trade association, there are 580 iron factories and workshops of varying sizes in Beiping, ranging from three or five people to seventy or eighty. After liberation, the trade unions in various districts began to organize a portion of the larger-scale iron industry workers, conducting political and cultural studies. The workers' class consciousness has greatly increased. For example, the workers of Lixingkui Factory voluntarily reduced their wages and changed their refined grains to coarse grains, enabling the factory to accumulate capital and develop production. However, the factory is still considering further action, and is unwilling to expand reproduction in a free manner, and the labor-capital relationship has not yet become normal.
    Most of the worker representatives who attended yesterday were representatives of workers from larger-scale factories. At the meeting, representatives of workers from Baofeng, Tiancheng, Yixin and other iron factories spoke one after another, reflecting that some capitalists still had a passive attitude towards expanding production. Some capitalists used the excuse of mutual benefit for labor and capital to get workers to work harder, and also said that "the factory's affairs are managed by the workers themselves, and there is no need for a union," and their attitude towards the workers has gradually become dictatorial, and that the general factory accounts are not made public. They expressed their eager hope to establish their own trade union as soon as possible and sign a collective labor-capital contract to protect the various interests of the workers. In the end, it was decided to convene a second temporary representative meeting in the next few days to elect and establish a preparatory committee for the iron industry union. (Jin Feng)

    铁工业职工代表
    集会商讨组织工会
    【本报讯】北平市职工总会筹委会产业工人工作委员会昨（九日）晚召开本市私营机器铁工业工人第一次临时代表会议，到会六十六个工厂代表八十一人，商讨成立铁工业工会及订立劳资集体合同事宜。
    北平大小铁工厂及作坊据同业公会统计有五百八十家，规模大小不等，自三、五人至七、八十人。解放后各区工会曾开始组织一部分规模较大的铁工业工人，进行政治及文化学习，工人的阶级觉悟大为提高，如利兴魁厂工人曾自动减低工资，并把细粮改成粗粮，使厂方能积累资金，发展生产；但厂方顾虑仍多，不肯放手扩大再生产，劳资关系仍未趋向正常。
    昨日到会工人代表多为规模较大之工厂工人代表，会上宝丰、天成、益信等铁工厂工人代表纷纷发言，反映一部分资方对于扩大生产的态度仍消极，有些资方且借口劳资两利要工人多干活，又说“工厂的事工人自己管，不需要工会”，对于工人态度逐渐专横，而且一般厂方帐目不公开。他们热切表示希望及早成立自己的工会，订立劳资集体合同，以保障工人的各种利益。最后决定不日召开第二次临时代表会议，选举成立铁工业工会筹委会。（金凤）
