Fu Jen University's faculty and staff, in order to improve their understanding of politics and unwilling to spend their summer vacation idly, have specially established a summer study group to engage in the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Although participation in this study group is voluntary, most have joined, with the exception of a few part-time instructors. Even elders over sixty years old, such as Dean Yu Jiaxi, Academic Dean Xu Shifeng, and Professor Zhang Xinglang, are studying together with the young people. Currently, there are around 170 participants, divided into twenty-one groups. President Chen Yuan pays close attention to this matter, spending a great deal of time each day to understand the learning situation of each group, encouraging everyone's learning enthusiasm.

The study period was originally scheduled from July 11th to September 2nd, with planned study materials including A Brief History of Social Development, Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism, On New Democracy, and On the People's Democratic Dictatorship. The learning methods adopted are individual reading, collective discussion, and inviting government leaders and experts to give lectures or answer questions.

During the study, everyone felt that their political understanding was insufficient, especially their knowledge of materialist theory, so their desire for knowledge was very high, and they studied the above books with an open mind and enthusiasm. On average, individuals spent more than four hours a day reading, and they also developed a strong interest in collective learning, with very serious debates in discussion sessions. An old professor said, "At first, I thought I could understand it by reading it myself, and two discussions a week were too much; now I think it's too little." Some also said, "After liberation, I didn't know how to start learning new knowledge, but now I have a starting point, like having a handrail when going downstairs." In two weeks, two academic lectures were held. The first was by Mr. Deng Chumin on the history of social development, and the second was by Comrade Nan Hanchen on the current economic situation in our country. The content was very substantial, and everyone felt that it solved many difficult problems. A professor in the Faculty of Arts said, "In the past, I was dissatisfied with the Kuomintang, but I didn't understand it clearly. After reading historical materialism, understanding the laws of social development and class analysis, I clearly understood that the Kuomintang reactionaries were corrupt because of their class essence, and their inevitable demise was also in accordance with the laws."

Although everyone lacked experience in learning methods, they had the confidence to be creative. Initially, the shortcomings in learning were focusing too much on explaining nouns and terms, failing to grasp the spirit and essence of the documents, and failing to effectively combine them with the reality of the Chinese revolution and individual thoughts, using criticism and self-criticism for learning; there were also phenomena of discussions deviating from the focus and uneven speaking opportunities in discussion sessions; the progress of reading was also uneven at first. These shortcomings are being gradually improved through collective learning, and many have already been overcome.

In the short two weeks of study, everything was exploratory, but preliminary results have been achieved. Everyone recognizes what Secretary-General Zhang Zonglin of the Higher Education Association said at the founding meeting of the study group: "Ideological transformation is not an easy task, and eight weeks of study is just the beginning of ideological transformation." Everyone is determined to complete the eight-week study plan and is willing to continue learning in future work.

### 辅大教职员的暑期学习

    辅大教职员的暑期学习
    辅仁大学教职员为了提高对于政治的认识，不愿意把署假空空的渡过，特地成立了一个署期学习会，从事马列主义和毛泽东思想的学习。这个学习会虽然采取自由参加的方式，但除少数兼任教员外，大都参加了。花甲以上的老人如余嘉锡院长、徐侍峰教务长、张星＠教授等也都和年青人在一块共同学习。现在参加的人数共一百七十人上下，分二十一个小组。陈垣校长对此事非常注意，每天要用很多的时间去了解各小组的学习情况，鼓舞了大家的学习情绪。
    学习日期，原定自七月十一日起至九月二日止，计划学习的材料有社会发展简史、辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义、新民主主义论、论人民民主专政等。学习方法则采取个人阅读、集体讨论及请政府首长和专家讲演或解答问题。
    在学习中，由于大家都觉得政治认识不够，尤其对于唯物主义的理论所知甚少，因此求知欲都很高，对于上列书籍都虚心的热烈的学习。平均个人阅读时间，每日在四小时以上，对集体学习也都有了浓厚的兴趣，讨论会上争论问题非常认真。一位老教授说：“开始时我觉得自己看看就可以懂了，一星期讨论两次太多；现在却以为太少了。”也有人说：“解放后我不知如何着手学习新知识，现在我有了着落，象下楼梯有了扶手。”在两星期时间内曾举办了两次学术讲演，第一次是邓初民先生讲社会发展史，第二次是南汉宸同志讲我国目前经济情况，内容都很充实，大家认为解决了许多不易解决的问题。文学院一位教授说：“过去对国民党不满意，但了解并不清楚。读了唯物史观，了解了社会发展的规律及阶级分析法，才明确知道国民党反动派之所以腐败是其阶级本质规定的，它之必然灭亡也是合乎规律的。”
    大家在学习方法方面虽然经验不多，但有创造的信心。起初在学习上的缺点是太着重解释名辞、术语及抓不住文件的精神实质，而且也不能很好的结合中国革命实际及个人的思想，用批评与自我批评的方法进行学习；在讨论会上有的发言脱离重心及发言机会不均现象；阅读进程起初也参差不齐。这些缺点经过集体学习正逐步改进，现在已经克服了很多。
    短短的两星期学习中，一切都是摸索，但已获得了初步成绩。大家都认识到高教会秘书长张宗麟同志在学习会成立会上说的：“思想改造不是件容易事情，学习八个星期，不过是思想改造的开始。”大家有决心完成八个星期的学习计划，并愿意在今后的工作中要不断的学习。
