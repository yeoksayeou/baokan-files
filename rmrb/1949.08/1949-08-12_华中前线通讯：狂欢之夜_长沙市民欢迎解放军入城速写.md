    Central China Frontline Dispatch: Night of Revelry
    A Sketch of Changsha Citizens Welcoming the People's Liberation Army into the City
    Mu Qing
    August 5th was a great festival for the people of Changsha. On this day, Changsha was peacefully liberated. At 8:30 PM, the mighty ranks of the People's Liberation Army solemnly entered Changsha city amidst the cheers of the multitude. That night, Changsha was brightly lit throughout the city, and 500,000 citizens reveled all night long, creating an unprecedented grand occasion for Changsha.

    The people of Changsha, who had suffered greatly under the devastation of the Chiang Kai-shek and Bai Chongxi bandit gangs, began to take enthusiastic action several days prior to celebrate this peaceful liberation and welcome the People's Liberation Army into the city. Representatives from fifty-three units throughout the city spontaneously organized a Joint Committee to Welcome the Liberation Army (referred to as "Yingjielian"). Starting on the 3rd, one hundred and fourteen units, including nearly 100,000 organized masses, registered with Yingjielian and, under its command, busied themselves day and night preparing for everything. They plastered all kinds of welcome slogans and posters all over the city. Every household neatly hung two red flags in front of their doors. From morning till night, the sounds of practicing singing and performing Yangko dances could be heard everywhere in Changsha. Because citizens were scrambling to make paper flowers and buy firecrackers, all the paper shops and firecracker shops in Changsha were packed, until all their stock was sold out. And the tailors, busy making silk banners, could not keep up with the number of customers even though they were pedaling their sewing machines day and night. In the scorching heat and under enemy aircraft bombing, the people in the Yingjielian office insisted on working, staying up for two entire nights. They set up a temporary broadcasting station, constantly broadcasting news about welcoming the People's Liberation Army. Workers at the telephone bureau also managed to connect with the People's Liberation Army preparing to enter the city, constantly shouting to the outside of the city, "Comrades! Come quickly!"

    When the People's Liberation Army decided to enter the city at 8:00 PM on the 5th, the broadcasting station immediately broadcast the news, and all the newspapers in the city issued temporary extra editions. On the 5th, starting in the morning, people could no longer wait. Teams of people, Yangko dance troupes, trucks, and countless flags and firecrackers, gradually gathered. Around 2:00 PM, a crowd of about 100,000 people, braving the scorching sun and the danger of enemy aircraft bombing, gathered outside Xiaowumen. They gazed eastward with anxious hearts. The Yingjielian's consolation group with dozens of consolation trucks and the liaison group with thousands of bicycles ran back and forth like shuttles, constantly telling people the news of where the People's Liberation Army had arrived, but people were still impatient. Around 5:00 PM, the crowd welcoming the PLA grew larger and larger, and people simply went out to the suburbs to greet them, stopping only seven or eight miles outside the city. The welcoming team stretched for more than ten miles from beginning to end, and the tea prepared for the People's Liberation Army was also laid out along this long distance.

    When the People's Liberation Army crossed the Liuyang River and slowly marched towards the brightly lit urban area at 8:30 PM, cheers of "They're here!" resounded everywhere, and the broadcasting station broadcast loudly, "Our troops are here! Our loved ones are here!" Then, the People's Liberation Army's resounding bugle call came over, and the sounds of firecrackers, gongs and drums, slogans, and cheers immediately rang out in the crowd. The crowd surged forward like a whirlwind and angry waves. Men and women, young and old, all twisted and sang hand in hand. Many old ladies were jostled and stumbled, but they still laughed and refused to leave, determined to see their own army.

    Soon, the solemn ranks of the People's Liberation Army finally appeared in front of the masses. In front were three jeeps, followed by neatly armed troops. When the masses saw them, it was as if they were seeing long-separated loved ones. With a shout of joy, they immediately surrounded them. Countless workers and students desperately squeezed to the front, warmly shaking hands and greeting the soldiers. Many people scrambled to climb onto the vehicles, but they were pulled down by the people behind them if they were not careful. The 200-member Yangko dance troupe from Hunan University had to exert great effort to rush to the front, but the crowded masses never gave them a chance to perform. At this time, workers presented flags and female students presented flowers, dressing each soldier like a new person. The enthusiasm for presenting flowers became higher and higher, and many people even scrambled to give books, newspapers, and photos to the People's Liberation Army. For a whole hour, the队伍 could hardly move forward. With great difficulty, the crowd's discipline squad opened a path, but it was immediately surrounded by the crowd again, making it impossible to move forward. Advancing and stopping like this, the welcoming crowd along the way grew larger and larger, cheers and gongs and drums were everywhere, and the sound of firecrackers resounded all the way from outside the city to inside the city. The short three to five li journey took a full three or four hours.

    Around 12:00 midnight, the troops entered the urban area, and paper flowers were scattered from the buildings on both sides of the road, and the street was covered with an inch-deep layer of firecracker debris. Fathers carried their sons on their backs, and daughters-in-law supported their mothers-in-law. Everyone shouted and squeezed as if they were crazy. Many people who could not see the army set up tables and benches along the street and stood on the tables and benches to watch. Some people simply climbed up the utility poles. At first, people desperately sang, but later, after all the songs had been sung, everyone temporarily made up songs to sing. One side sang "The People's Liberation Army is good," and the other side sang "The People's Liberation Army is wonderful, the People's Liberation Army is terrific." This was followed by bursts of earth-shattering laughter and applause. Some citizens were so excited that they kept rushing into the middle of the troops and started doing Yangko dances with the People's Liberation Army. Many people who did not know how to do Yangko dances, because they could not express their inner joy, danced around wildly whenever they had the chance.

    From Cai E Road to Xinjun Road, there were such enthusiastic scenes everywhere. Wherever the People's Liberation Army went, there were crowds of people, and wherever they went, firecrackers were set off. In order to maintain the smooth progress of the troops, people finally formed an arm chain hand in hand to allow the troops to pass through the middle. And the masses standing at the very front automatically gathered countless white fans, constantly fanning the sweating People's Liberation Army soldiers.

    The heroic ranks of the People's Liberation Army also sang military songs and shouted slogans heroically to warmly thank the people of Changsha for their welcome.

    At 2:00 AM in the deep night, the troops finally arrived at the designated area of ​​residence, but the welcoming crowd was still crowded and did not leave. The Yangko dance teams from various units took advantage of this good opportunity to show off their skills. Hunan University's White Dragon Lantern, like a dragon tumbling up and down in the waves of the sea of ​​people, was radiant and won the most applause. The Art Industry Association even more ingeniously weaved a green dragon with pine branches and pomegranate leaves, hovering in the air, with the lights reflecting each other, symbolizing the auspiciousness of peaceful liberation. But the most popular with the masses was another Yangko dance team. That Yangko dance team played two animals, one was a turtle named "bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek" and the other was a clam spirit named "wicked demon Song Meiling." The masses clapped and applauded vigorously for this performance.

    This continued until 3:00 AM in the deep night, and people slowly dispersed. But the gongs and drums of the Yangko dance team and the firecrackers of the masses continued to sound until dawn.

    When the citizens of Changsha walked into their own homes with a day and night of fatigue, looking at the morning glow in the east, they could not help but excitedly say: The sky is truly bright. [Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 11th]

    华中前线通讯：狂欢之夜
    长沙市民欢迎解放军入城速写
    穆青
    八月五日是长沙人民伟大的节日，这一天长沙和平解放了。人民解放军强大的行列，于下午八时半，在万众欢呼中庄严开入长沙城。是晚，长沙全市灯火辉煌，五十万市民澈夜狂欢，为长沙空前未有盛况。
    饱受蒋白匪帮摧残的长沙人民，为着庆祝这次和平解放，欢迎人民解放军入城，早在几天以前就热情地行动起来了。全市人民由五十三个单位为代表，自动组织了一个迎接解放军联合委员会（简称“迎解联”），从三日开始，就有一百一十四个单位，包括近十万有组织的群众，在迎解联登记，并在它的指挥下，日夜奔忙地进行着一切准备工作。他们把各种各样的欢迎标语、画报，贴满了全城。家家户户门前整齐地悬挂着两面红旗。从早到晚，在长沙全城到处都可以听到练习唱歌和排演秧歌的锣鼓声。由于市民抢着做纸花、买鞭炮，长沙全市所有的纸张店、爆竹店门前，都拥挤不堪，直至所有存货都卖光了。而忙着做锦旗的裁缝，虽然日夜踏着缝纫机，也无法应付那样多的主顾。在酷热的气候和敌机的轰炸下，迎解联办公处的人们坚持工作，整整两宵未睡，他们装起临时广播台，随时播送着迎接解放军的消息。电话局的工友并设法和准备入城的解放军接上了电话，不时地向城外呼喊着：“同志们！你们快来呀！”
    当人民解放军决定五日晚八时入城时，广播台立即把这一消息广播出去，全市所有的报纸都发出了临时的号外。五日这一天，从早晨开始，人们就再也等待不下去了，一队队的人群、秧歌队，一辆辆的卡车，无数的旗帜鞭炮，都陆续集中起来了。下午二时左右，约有十万群众的行列，冒着烈日和敌机轰炸的危险，齐集在小吴门外。他们用焦急的心情向东方了望着。迎解联宣慰组数十辆慰问卡车及联络组上千辆的脚踏车，象穿梭一样的来回奔跑着，随时把解放军到达那里的消息告诉给人们，但人们仍然急不可待。下午五时左右，欢迎的人群愈来愈多了，人们就索性迎出郊外去，一直到离城七八里路以外才停止下来。欢迎队伍从头到尾长达十余里，而给解放军预备的茶水，也同样摆满了这段长长的距离。
    当下午八时半解放军渡过浏阳河缓缓的向灯光辉煌的市区开进时，到处响起“来了”的欢呼声，广播台更高声播出：“我们的队伍来了！我们的亲人来了！”接着，人民解放军嘹亮的军号就传过来，人群中鞭炮声、锣鼓声、口号声、欢呼声，立即响成了一片。人群象一阵急风怒浪一样，拼命地向前拥挤着。男女老少大家都手拉手的扭起来，唱起来。许多老太太被挤得东倒西歪，仍一直欢笑着不肯退出去，一定要看看自己的军队。
    不久，人民解放军的庄严行列，终于在群众的面前出现了。前面是三辆吉普车，接着便是武装整齐的部队。群众看见了他们，就象看见了久别的亲人一样，一声欢呼，立即把他们围得水泄不通。无数的工人学生，拼命地挤在最前面，热情地和战士们握手问好，许多人争抢着爬上了车子，但一不留心又被后面的人拉下来。湖南大学二百人的秧歌队，费了九牛二虎之力抢到前面去，但拥挤着的人群始终不给他们一个表演的机会。这时，工人献旗，女学生献花，把每一个战士都打扮得象一个新人一样。献花的热潮愈来愈高，甚至有许多人抢着把书籍、报纸、照片送给解放军。整整有一个钟头，队伍简直无法前进，好容易由群众的纠察队开出一条道路来，但一下子又被群众围拢得无法前进。这样走走停停，一路上欢迎的人群越来越多，欢声、锣鼓，闹成一片，鞭炮声更是从城外一直响到城里。短短三五里路程就足足走了三四个钟头。
    夜十二点左右，队伍走进市区，沿途两旁楼上飘散着纸花，街道上积起了一寸深的爆竹屑。爹爹驮起儿子，媳妇搀着婆婆，大家都象疯狂似地喊着，挤着。许多看不见军队的人们，就在沿街摆上桌凳，站在桌凳上去看。有些人索性爬到电线杆上去了。开始人们还拼命地唱歌，后来所有的歌子都唱过了，大家就临时编着歌唱，这边唱“解放军好”，那边唱“解放军妙，解放军呱呱叫”。接着是一阵阵震天动地的笑声和掌声。有些市民兴奋得一直闯进队伍中间去，拉着解放军就扭起秧歌来。许多不会扭秧歌的人，由于无法表示内心的高兴，一有机会便乱跳一阵。
    从蔡锷路到新军路止，到处是这样热烈的场面。解放军走到那里，那里就人山人海，那里就爆竹齐鸣。为着保持部队的顺利行进，最后人们就手拉手形成一条臂链，让队伍从中间通过。而站在最前面的群众，更自动集中了无数把白扇子，为满身汗水的解放军战士不停地扇风。
    人民解放军的英雄行列，也雄壮地唱着军歌，喊着口号，来热烈地答谢长沙人民的欢迎。
    深夜二时，部队好容易到达了预定的驻区，但欢迎的群众仍然拥挤着不走，各个单位的秧歌队更利用这一良机大显身手。湖南大学的白龙灯，象一条翻滚在人海波涛中的蛟龙一样上下翻腾，光芒万丈，博得掌声最多。艺业公会更别出心裁地以松枝和石榴叶编成一条绿色的龙，盘旋半空，灯光辉映，象征着和平解放的祥瑞。但最受群众欢迎的还是另一个秧歌队，那个秧歌队里扮演着两个动物，一个是以“匪首蒋介石”为名的乌龟，另一个是以“万恶妖蘖宋美龄”为名的蚌精。群众对这个表演，使劲地拍手称快。
    这样一直闹到深夜三时，人们才慢慢地散走。但秧歌队的锣鼓和群众的鞭炮声，却一直响到黎明。
    当长沙市民带着一天一夜的疲劳走进自己的家门时，眼望着东方的晨曦，他们不禁兴奋地说：天真正亮了。  【新华社汉口十一日电】
