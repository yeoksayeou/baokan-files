[Ping Shi News] After the announcement of the industry-specific score assessments for the second half of the 37th year's (1948) business income tax, the allocation of burdens to individual households within each industry has been largely completed. As of the 19th, the Municipal Tax Bureau had reviewed and approved ninety industries that could submit payment vouchers. The Municipal Tax Bureau held a conference of appraisal committee members at all levels at the National Grand Theater on the morning of the 19th to report on the basic spirit and work process of this appraisal. More than 1,300 people attended. Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu of the Municipal Government attended and delivered a speech.

In his speech, Vice Mayor Zhang first used facts to illustrate that today's government is the people's government, and the people of Beiping have not only gained rights politically, but also have economic guarantees, and therefore, should fulfill their tax obligations. Today's tax revenue is taken from the people and used for the people, which is fundamentally different from the tax revenue of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past. He emphasized that there is still a large imbalance in the burden on urban and rural people today. Farmers pay 20 to 25 percent of their income annually as public grain to support the front lines; while today's tax revenue in Beiping is only enough for about 50 percent of the city's expenses, with the remainder subsidized by the North China Government. In other words, Beiping's expenses are still supported by the farmers in the North China Liberated Areas. Therefore, the people of Beiping and Beiping's industrial and commercial households should complete their tax obligations as soon as possible in order to build a new Beiping and support the front lines.

Then, Zhao Zishang, Director of the Municipal Tax Bureau, reported, using concrete figures to make a detailed comparison between the burden on Beiping's industrial and commercial households today and the exorbitant taxes and levies of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, and reported to everyone on the process of the industry-specific score assessment. Following this, Cheng Hongyi, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, reported, pointing out the prospects for Beiping's industry and commerce under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and calling on industrialists and businessmen to improve product quality, offer good quality and low prices, face the countryside, absorb idle funds to participate in production, and stop speculation, in order to overcome the various difficulties that still exist. Finally, Fu Huating, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, spoke, pointing out that the appraisal committee members generally made great efforts in this appraisal work. He expressed the hope that they would continue to work hard in the future to assist the government in completing its tax obligations.

　　此次评议税收精神
  　平衡城乡负担建设人民北平
    张副市长在各级评委大会上讲
    【平市讯】三十七年下半年度营利事业所得税各业分数评定公布后，工商各业随即分配业内各户负担，现已大致就绪。到十九日止，经市税局审查批准可以填交缴款书的已有九十个行业。市税局特于十九日上午在国民大戏院召开各级评议委员大会，报告此次评议的基本精神与工作经过，到有一千三百余人。市府张友渔副市长亲临讲话。张副市长在讲话中首以事实说明，今天的政府是人民的政府，北平市的人民不但在政治上已获得了权利，而且在经济上也获得了保障，因此，应尽纳税义务。今天的税款，政府是取之于民、用之于民的，与过去国民党反动派的税收有本质上的不同。并强调指出：今天城乡人民负担尚存在有很大的不平衡，农民每年以收入的百分之二十至二十五交纳公粮，支援前线；而今天北平税款收入仅够本市开支的百分之五十左右，其余的由华北政府补助，也就是说，北平开支尚靠华北解放区的农民支持。因此，北平人民、北平工商业户，应该为了建设新北平，为了支援前线，尽速完成自己的纳税义务。继由市税局赵子尚局长报告，他以具体数字把今天北平工商业户的负担和过去国民党反动派时代的苛捐杂税，作了详细的比较，并向大家报告了此次各业分数评议工作的经过。继由市工商局程宏毅局长报告，他指出北平工商业在中共领导下的远景，号召工商业家要提高产品质量，物美价廉，面向乡村，并吸收游资参加生产，制止投机，来克服目前尚存在的种种困难。最后，由市商会整理委员会主委傅华亭讲话，他指出评议委员一般的都在此次评议工作中尽了很大力量。希望今后继续努力，协助政府，完成纳税义务。
