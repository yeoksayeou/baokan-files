　　Striving for the City's Industry
  　Industrial Visiting Group to Depart Tomorrow
    Will Also Investigate Raw Material Market Needs in Various Locations to Develop New Industries
    [This City News] The departure date of the city's industrial visiting group has been postponed to the 24th of this month (originally scheduled for the 22nd) due to the continued participation of various industries and to allow for adequate preparation before departure. Currently, the group includes 14 units from industries such as machinery, weaving and dyeing, leather making, knitting, soap and alkali manufacturing, and carpet making. Yesterday (22nd) at 3:00 PM, the group gathered at the Beijing Municipal Industrial Association and unanimously agreed that the purpose of this trip is to restore, transform, and develop Beijing's industrial production, facilitate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and resolve the product and raw material issues of various industries. Therefore, they should abandon the selfish and self-serving mentality of only looking after their own factories and strive for the benefit of the entire city's industry. At the meeting, Yu Zhong, the manager of Beijing Industrial Company, which specializes in beer, proposed that beer sales are difficult under today's national economic conditions, and the factory's funds cannot be used properly, which is a great loss. This visit should focus on what the rural markets need and what raw materials they produce, so that the factory can convert to another industry based on this information upon return. This suggestion gave the visiting group a new insight: the purpose of the visit is not only to solve the problems of selling finished products and purchasing raw materials but also to utilize the raw materials and market needs in various locations to develop new industries.

　　为全市工业努力
  　工业参观团明起程
    并将考察各地原料市场需要，发展新工业
    【本市讯】本市工业参观团起程日期，因续有行业参加，并使行前有充分准备，延期至本月二十四日（原定二十二日）。现参加该团者已有机器业、织染业、制革业、针织业、造胰制碱业、地毯业等十四个单位。昨（二十二）日下午三时，该团在北平市工业会集会，一致认为：此行是为了恢复改造和发展北平市的工业生产，沟通城乡物资交流，使各业的产品和原料问题得以解决，因此应打破过去只顾本厂的自私自利观念，为全市工业而努力。会上，专营啤酒的北平实业公司经理于忠提出：啤酒在今天的国民经济条件下，销路较困难，厂中资金不能适当运用，是很大损失，此次参观，要看看乡村市场需要什么，并产有什么原料，回来后便可据以转业。他这一意见，给参观团以一个新的启示，即参观的目的，不仅在解决推销成品、采购原料方面的问题，并应利用各地原料及市场需要，来发展新的工业。
