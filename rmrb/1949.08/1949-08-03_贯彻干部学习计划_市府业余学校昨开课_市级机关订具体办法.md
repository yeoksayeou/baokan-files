To Implement the Cadre Study Plan
Municipal Government Spare-Time School Opens
Municipal-Level Organs Formulate Specific Measures

[This Municipality News] The Municipal Government's Study Committee, in order to strengthen the cultural and political learning of cadres with lower cultural levels, recently formed a spare-time school, which officially opened yesterday (the 2nd). More than seventy people have already attended classes. Cadres with low cultural levels from various bureaus are enrolling one after another. The spare-time school is temporarily divided into three classes: higher primary, lower primary, and literacy class. The higher primary class meets for two hours from 5:30 AM to 7:30 AM every day, and the lower primary and literacy classes meet for two hours from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM every day. The curriculum includes: Chinese language, arithmetic, natural science, and current affairs policies for the higher and lower primary classes; the literacy class focuses on literacy lessons, while also teaching some current affairs policies. The Study Committee is also continuing to prepare for the establishment of a middle school class. Many cadres have been asking the Study Committee about the opening date, preparing to enroll and attend classes. (Municipal Government News Office)

[This Municipality News] The General Study Committee of the Beijing Municipal Level Organs convened a joint meeting of responsible comrades from the study committees of various units on July 31st. In accordance with the principles of the study plan formulated by the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, specific regulations were made regarding class organization, study content, and study leadership issues. Regarding class organization: those who need to study Party building and policies should be assigned to Class C. In addition to jointly studying policies, Party members and activists in Class C should study Party building, and cadres who joined the work after liberation should work harder to study the establishment of a revolutionary outlook on life and the basic domestic and international situation and tasks. Class D should focus on cultural learning. Large organs should run regular spare-time schools, and small units can set up cultural classes.

Regarding the content of study: the theoretical study for Classes A and B will focus on the twelve prescribed books; for Class C, in addition to policy study (especially policies related to work should be studied in depth), the Study Committee will temporarily stipulate unified study of important international, national, and municipal documents; the teaching materials for Class D can use the primary, higher primary, and junior high school textbooks stipulated by the North China People's Government.

Cadres of all organs must adhere to a two-hour study system every day, gradually developing study habits. The Study Committee should have a dedicated person responsible (the Party branch can be the basis, and the administrative responsible comrades can form the Study Committee to be responsible for promoting it). The specific plans of each unit are scheduled to be submitted to the Study Committee for review and approval within a week.

    【本市讯】市府学委会为加强文化水平较低的干部之文化政治学习，顷组成业余学校，昨（二日）起正式开课，上课的已有七十余人。各局文化程度低的干部正陆续入学。业余学校暂分高小、初小和识字班三班。高小班每天上午五点半到七点半上课两小时，初小和识字班每天下午六点到八点上课两小时。课程内容：高小、初小班有国文、算术、自然科学和时事政策等课；识字班注重识字课，同时也讲授一些时事政策。学委会并正继续筹备成立中学班。好多干部都纷纷向学委会询问开学日期，准备入学听课。（市府新闻处）
    【本市讯】北平市一级机关总学委会于七月三十一日召开各单位学委会负责同志的联席会议，按照市委宣传部所订学习计划原则，对编班、学习内容和学习领导问题，作出具体规定。关于编班规定：需要学习党建和政策者都编入丙班。丙班除共同学习政策外，党员和积极分子应学习党建，解放后参加工作的干部则更应努力学习建立革命人生观和国内外基本的形势与任务等。丁班应着重文化学习，大机关要办正规的业余学校，小单位可设文化班。
    关于学习内容：甲乙两班的理论学习以规定的十二本书为主；丙班的学习，除政策学习（特别是与工作有关的政策更应深入学习）外，关于国际性、全国性、全市性的重要文件，则由学委会临时规定统一学习；丁班的教材，可用华北人民政府所订的初小、高小和初中的课本。
    各机关的干部，每天必须坚持二小时的学习制度，逐步养成学习习惯，学委会要有专人负责（可以党支部为基础，和行政负责同志组成学委会，负责推动）。关于各单位的具体计划定于一星期内交学委会审核批准。
