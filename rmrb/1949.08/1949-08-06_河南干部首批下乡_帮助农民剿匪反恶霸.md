Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 5th. In response to the call of the Central China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party to "Go to the countryside," cadres from provincial-level agencies and special districts and counties in Henan Province are going to the countryside in large numbers. The work teams formed by the first batch of cadres from provincial-level agencies went to Chenliu Special District on the 27th of last month to work. Their main task is to help the peasant masses launch a movement to suppress bandits and fight local tyrants, and to conduct rural surveys, research, and collect various specific materials for reference by governments at all levels when deciding on the methods and steps for carrying out rural social reforms. More than 200 cadres from various directly subordinate agencies in Luoyang Special District have also gone to places such as Songxian County and Yiyang County to work. Before going to the countryside, they had detailed discussions on various specific policies regarding bandit suppression. The Luoyang County Head personally led cadres to go deep into rural areas to strengthen leadership over rural work. Sixty young students from Xinyang County organized a summer work group and went to the countryside in early July to carry out rural work under the leadership of the local government.
