On Hydropower Construction in New China
    Cheng Xuemin
    I. New Prospects for Hydropower Construction
    Water is one of the most important substances on Earth and is closely related to human life. By studying humanity's control and utilization of water, we can see the history of humanity's struggle with nature and the development of human society. In primitive communist society, humans not only could not utilize the power of water, but were fundamentally unable to control it. Therefore, many stories about "water disasters" exist in ancient myths and legends. At that time, humanity's only method of dealing with water disasters was to escape. With the formation of feudal agricultural society, the relationship between humans and land gradually stabilized, and people developed methods of "flood prevention" and "water management" to protect their fields and homes from flooding. At the same time, the simplest irrigation and utilization of water power (such as waterwheels for drawing water) gradually began. However, in the self-sufficient economic system of agricultural society, the accumulation and concentration of capital were still small, and large-scale "water conservancy" projects did not develop. The successive appearance of terms such as "water disaster," "flood prevention," "water management," and "water conservancy" in history demonstrates humanity's evolution from understanding nature to transforming nature and utilizing nature. The 18th-century Industrial Revolution and the invention of the steam engine stimulated the development of capitalist industrial society, and the developed industry needed even greater amounts of motive power. The invention of electricity made the application of steam power more widespread, and the success of hydroelectric power generation further increased the source of motive power. Thus, with the improvement of long-distance power transmission technology, hydropower construction has advanced rapidly in the capitalist world over the past four or five decades. Even on the eve of the collapse of capitalism, during the severe economic crisis, U.S. President Roosevelt's famous New Deal measures sought to use large-scale hydropower construction to solve some of its internal contradictions. This attempt was certainly not successful, but it also proved that large-scale hydropower construction is one of the most effective methods for greatly increasing productivity. Its impact is not only on industry but also beneficial to agriculture, transportation, and the entire economic and cultural life. This has given rise to the term "multiple-purpose project."
    The meaning of "multiple-purpose project" is that when we develop a river, we should focus not only on its hydropower utilization but also consider other aspects of benefits and effects. When planning a project, we must consider the coordinated application of various aspects to achieve diverse goals with one or a group of engineering constructions. This makes the entire project an organic whole, with various functions complementing each other to achieve the highest economic value. This is a major advancement in humanity's methods and concepts for controlling nature and utilizing resources. The Grand Coulee Dam, Bonneville Dam, TVA in the United States, and the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station and the Great Volga projects in the Soviet Union are all examples of "multiple-purpose projects."
    In capitalist society, the sole goal of all economic activities is the pursuit of profit. However, in the multiple-purpose projects I mentioned above, some benefits (such as flood control, navigation, sanitation, tourism, etc.) cannot be calculated in monetary terms and are therefore not easily converted into profits through sales, taxes, or other methods. Therefore, capitalists are not interested in these benefits, and the government must manage them. However, this gives rise to the following three contradictions: First, such a large undertaking managed by the government violates the capitalist golden rule of private enterprise. Second, even if some people in a government representing the interests of capitalists are willing to spend money to build these large-scale projects, they may not be supported by their behind-the-scenes bosses, the profit-seeking capitalists. Third, some of the multiple-purpose projects in the hands of the government are still business-oriented and often compete with private enterprises, leading to conflicts. Therefore, multiple-purpose projects cannot be fully developed in the hands of capitalist governments.
    We see that although humanity has begun to learn how to utilize this enormous natural force, this productive force cannot be unleashed due to the constraints of the socio-economic system, and it cannot work for the majority of the people. This fundamental contradiction must be unified under a new socio-economic system.
    For example, the Three Gorges multiple-purpose project plan in China can generate more than ten million kilowatts of electricity, irrigate sixty million mu of land, improve more than one thousand kilometers of waterways, greatly reduce flooding in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and provide sufficient water for many cities along the river. This plan is merely a mockery in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society and cannot be realized. Even if it were realized, it would be meaningless: a large amount of cheap electricity might create a few big capitalists, and large-scale irrigation would only benefit some big landlords, increasing their wealth and enabling them to exploit the majority of the people more effectively. However, in a new democratic society, the meaning of this plan would be different. Ten million kilowatts of electricity are equivalent to the labor of one hundred million people, meaning that in our work of building a new society, we will add a force equivalent to the labor of one hundred million people, helping us work day and night. What a great impact this will have on improving the lives of our people and promoting the realization of our ideal society! What a wonderful plan this is!

    II. China's Hydropower Resources
    The total hydropower resources stored in the rivers within China were previously estimated to be between 20 million and 40 million kilowatts. This estimate was based on incomplete data and was too low. A more recent and concrete estimate is over 136.7 million kilowatts (estimated by the National Hydropower Engineering Bureau in 1947). Although this figure is still incomplete, it has increased more than fourfold compared to the initial estimate. The distribution of these hydropower resources is listed in the table below:
    Table 1:
    Distribution of Hydropower Resources in China
    Basin  　Stored Hydropower (10,000 kW)　　Remarks
    1. Yangtze River Basin  82,700
    2. Yellow River Basin  18,600
    3. Northeast Rivers  6,400
    4. North China Rivers  500
    5. Pearl River Basin  3,700
    6. Zhejiang-Fujian Rivers  1,900
    7. Taiwan and Hainan Island  2,800
    8. Rivers Between Hengduan Mountains  10  Data Extremely Incomplete
    9. Yarlung Tsangpo River Basin  20,000  Data Extremely Incomplete
    10. Inland Rivers of Xinjiang  3  Data Extremely Incomplete
    Total  　136,730
    Compared with other major hydropower countries in the world, this figure is listed in Table 2:
    Table 2: Comparison of Hydropower Resources in China, the Soviet Union, and the United States
    Hydropower Resources (10,000 kW)  Average Per Capita
    Country  　Using 95% of the Time　Using 50% of the Time Population (10,000)  Resource (kW)
    Soviet Union  58,500  281,000  16,800  1.67
    United States  40,500  69,000  14,100  0.94
    China  136,700  470,000  0.29
    Country  　Remarks
    Soviet Union  Report from the Third World Power Conference
    United States    Same as above
    China  　Estimated by the National Hydropower Engineering Bureau
    The table shows that China's hydropower resources are quite abundant. Although the average per capita resource is still not as good as the Soviet Union and the United States, it is much more favorable compared to other resources such as coal and iron.
    How much of these stored hydropower resources have we developed? Lamentably, only over 500,000 kilowatts, less than four-thousandths. And the vast majority of this is in the Northeast and Taiwan, developed by Japanese imperialism to strengthen its oppression and aggressive military industry.
    Table 3: Table of Developed Hydropower Resources in China
    Region  Development Volume (kW)  Percentage  　Remarks
    Northeast  340,000  64.4  Recent Figures May Have Changed
    Taiwan  174,000  33.1
    Other  12,000  2.3
    Total  526,000  100
    In a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, the development of hydropower resources is of course not valued, and the huge resources are only allowed to be wasted. The main task of new democratic construction is to improve our productivity, and the development of hydropower resources must be carried out on a large scale to liberate our majestic and abundant water power.

    III. The Position of Hydropower Construction in China's Economy
    I believe that economic construction in China under the New Democracy will gradually move towards planned development. The entire economic construction must have a complete plan in advance. From the accumulation of capital, the allocation of investment, the mode of production, the marketing of finished products, to the final consumption, the whole process must first be thoroughly considered in terms of the vertical aspect. In the horizontal aspect, the connection between various construction projects and their mutually assisting role must be closely coordinated. Individually, various construction projects can be divided and advanced in parallel, but combined, they should be an organic whole with even bones and flesh and proportionate ratios. The diversification of hydropower construction is inherently planned. Its position in the entire economic construction is particularly important. Many regional economic constructions in the world are based on one or a group of hydropower constructions to form their backbone. Experts in formulating plans often find that hydropower construction plays a key role in the overall construction, and thus there is a tendency to form a so-called "key plan."
    China's hydropower construction plan is a part of China's entire economic construction. Therefore, when we study hydropower construction, we must first look at the outline of the entire economic construction plan. Although experts in various fields have made various suggestions for the overall China construction plan in the past, no concrete plan has been formulated to date. The author does not want to add much discussion here, but only briefly introduce it in general terms:
    In the past, experts who studied national economic construction plans almost unanimously believed that regional economic construction is the most reasonable and effective. Based on the geographical and economic differences and connections, the country is divided into several regions, each with its own key points and characteristics. On the one hand, regional division of labor should be promoted to meet economic needs. On the other hand, appropriate regional self-sufficiency should be emphasized for defense considerations. It should be indisputable to promote the country's economic construction in this way.
    Although the views of various experts on the method of regional division are not entirely the same, a consensus can be reached in general terms. The main regions are approximately the following:
    1. Northeast Region
    2. North China Region
    3. Northwest Region
    4. Central China Region
    5. Southwest Region
    6. Southeast Region
    Generally speaking, the Northeast Region, the North China Region, and the Southwest Region will become China's main heavy industrial regions. The Northwest Region, the Central China Region, and the Southeast Region will become regions that focus more on light industry and agriculture.
    Whether it is heavy industry or light industry, there is a common need, which is motive power. The most modern motive power is electricity. In addition to the hydropower generation mentioned above, electricity can be generated in several different ways, namely burning coal, burning oil, utilizing wind power, and utilizing solar heat. The large-scale application of the latter three methods is not yet common. As for power plants that use coal to generate electricity (or thermal power plants), there are very many. There is sharp competition between hydropower generation and thermal power generation. Experts have already made too many statements about the advantages and disadvantages and comparisons of hydropower generation and thermal power generation. I do not want to repeat them here.
    In fact, hydropower generation and thermal power generation have their own advantages and disadvantages, complement each other, and should not be neglected. Therefore, the general proposal now is to jointly use hydropower and thermal power as the most economical source of motive power. Thermal power generation was developed earlier and has a longer history, but recently, power construction in various countries seems to emphasize hydropower generation more. The reasons are approximately as follows:
    First, the application of multiple-purpose projects reduces the cost of hydropower and increases other benefits, making the economic calculation of the project more favorable.
    Second, most of the cost of hydropower construction is spent on labor and civil engineering, which are domestic. Unlike thermal power plants, most of the cost is spent on machinery, which technologically backward countries must purchase from abroad with foreign exchange. The construction costs spent domestically can also stimulate domestic industrial development, which is a double benefit.
    Third, according to statistics from European and American countries, the ratio of construction costs (not cost) of thermal power generation to hydropower generation is approximately 100 to 160. In less developed countries, labor and some construction materials are relatively cheap, while machinery is relatively expensive due to imports. Therefore, the construction costs of the two may not differ much. Moreover, the construction cost of hydropower plants is greatly affected by the natural terrain. The construction costs of superior hydropower sites and inferior hydropower sites can differ by four or five times. In industrially backward countries, most of the first developed sites are relatively superior hydropower sites, and their construction costs may be very low. Therefore, they are even more favorable compared to thermal power plants.
    Fourth, due to the serious global coal shortage after the war, there is no hope of improvement in the short term. On the one hand, coal production is decreasing, and on the other hand, the use of coal is increasing day by day. Therefore, most countries hope to develop and utilize the endless resource—water—as much as possible and save and preserve the limited resource—coal—as much as possible.
    The above four points should also be given special consideration when we study China's economic construction plan. Of course, this does not mean that the power problem in China will be entirely borne by hydropower construction thereafter. However, under the aforementioned conditions, when we solve the power problem in a certain area, the utilization of water power should be given priority consideration. Here, of course, we cannot ignore the position of thermal power generation in the entire power grid and the importance of the joint use of water and fire.

    IV. Suggestions for Hydropower Construction in China's Initial Stage
    As mentioned earlier, China's hydropower construction should be coordinated with China's entire economic construction plan. Now that there is no specific plan for overall construction that can be used as a reference, drafting a so-called "hydropower plan" at this time is somewhat of a "closed-door" approach. But in fact, we cannot wait, because the overall construction plan is often based on individual plans that are then adjusted and unified. Therefore, I still boldly put forward a very preliminary suggestion here.
    The main meaning of the plan is, of course, to look into the future, but it must be based on reality. Our construction goal is a highly industrialized New China, but at present, the agricultural production technology in most parts of the country is still very backward. Except for North China and the Northeast, where heavy industrial construction can be said to have already begun, the situation is very poor in other places. When we put forward our initial construction plan based on such a realistic foundation, we must of course consider the level of industrialization in various regions and the differences in construction procedures. Therefore, in the Northeast, we must pay attention to expanding on the existing foundation. In North China, we must start laying the foundation. In other regions, we may still need some time for transformation and transition before we can start planned construction. In this way, our construction plans for each region are different in nature, and there are naturally differences in time. Generally speaking, the so-called "initial stage" in this article refers to the next five to ten years.
    In the Northeast, the principle of "water as the main and fire as the supplement" in hydropower construction was generally correct in the past. Taking the three hydropower projects that have been built, Xiaofengman, Shuifeng, and Jingbo Lake, their total capacity can exceed one million kilowatts (Shuifeng is jointly used with North Korea). However, the current installed power generation equipment is only 300,000 to 400,000 kilowatts. The dam projects in Xiaofengman and Shuifeng need to be improved. Our initial construction plan should, on the one hand, quickly repair the dams with engineering problems, and at the same time actively restore and expand the power generation, transmission, and substation capacity of these places.
    The conditions for heavy industrial construction in North China are even better than in the Northeast. The construction of iron and steel and chemical industries can be said to have already begun. The current power of more than 100,000 kilowatts in North China is entirely thermal power generation. In view of the rich coal mines in North China, the conditions for thermal power generation are of course more favorable. However, many rivers in North China urgently need to build a large number of reservoirs to reduce floods and increase irrigation due to the unevenness of drought and flood. With reservoirs, the utilization of water power becomes a by-product, and it is of course worth promoting to use water power in the form of by-products in North China. What’s more, there are many truly excellent hydropower sites in the upper reaches of the Hutuo River and the Juma River, and it is also beneficial to develop them mainly for hydropower. The projects that can be developed recently include Zijingguan on the North Juma River and Luomatun on the Luan River.
    The main problem in agriculture in the Northwest is "water." When we solve the problem of agricultural water use in the Northwest, we can also develop water power at the same time. The industrial centers of the Northwest are now in Lanzhou, Xi'an, Baoji and other places. To build the Northwest, it is best to start with these places first. The development of Zhulama Gorge on the Yellow River and Baoji Gorge on the Wei River can provide power for industrial production in Lanzhou and Baoji, and can be included in the initial construction plan.
    The Southwest lacks coal extremely, but other resources are abundant, and the construction of heavy industry is very promising. Unfortunately, there is no foundation at all now. For the construction of the Southwest, the author suggests that we first build some cities with excellent industrial conditions nearby to become the strongholds for future development, and then establish a large-scale industrial area. In this way, the initial hydropower construction can include projects such as the Longxi River near Chongqing, the Dadu River and Mabian River near Leshan, and the Tanglang River near Kunming.
    Generally speaking, the hydropower resources in the Central China region do not match the industrial proportion of this region. However, in the course of power construction in Central China, there is the Three Gorges Project. The Three Gorges Project seemed to be an extremely huge and almost unrealistic plan in the past. But when we see the achievements of the Soviet Union's construction, there are many far-reaching plans that were initially doubted, ridiculed, and even ridiculed by capitalist countries. Later, due to the rapid increase in the momentum of industrial construction, these plans have become practical, reasonable, and appropriate plans. We must also have this view of the Three Gorges Project. Of course, the Three Gorges Project will not start in the near future. In the initial hydropower construction in Central China, we can pay attention to the Zi River in Hunan, which has the largest hydropower site closest to the industrial centers such as Changsha and Zhuzhou.
    The industry in the Southeast region is now concentrated in several large coastal cities. In order to develop the industry in the Southeast region, the industry of these large cities should be expanded first. The initial hydropower construction, such as the ＠ River near Guangzhou, the Gutian near Fuzhou, and the Qiantang River near Shanghai, can be considered for development.
    Based on the above analysis, the author suggests that in the next five to ten years, in terms of hydropower construction, we must at least restore and expand 500,000 kilowatts in the Northeast. Build 500,000 kilowatts in other regions. In addition, necessary power transmission and substation equipment should be installed. We must also actively carry out the national hydropower resource survey and exploration work, as well as the planning and design work of other important hydropower projects, as a preparation for larger-scale hydropower construction in the future.
    There is currently no sufficient data available to estimate the cost of hydropower construction in China. According to US statistics, the average construction cost per kilowatt of hydropower is approximately $175 (according to Barrow). The Japanese figure is 322 yen per kilowatt (according to the Japanese Electrical Society), which is approximately $100 per kilowatt. The Chinese figure should be closer to the Japanese figure. To be generous, set it at $120 per kilowatt. However, the above figures are based on statistics before 1940. Considering the devaluation of the dollar in these nine years, this figure should be increased by at least 70%, which is approximately $200 per kilowatt. The mechanical and electrical equipment accounts for approximately 40%, which is $80 per kilowatt. In this way, the 500,000 kilowatts we want to build will cost approximately US$100 million. The expansion of 500,000 kilowatts will cost approximately US$40 million. The estimated cost of transmission and substation equipment is approximately US$30 million. The total cost of initial hydropower construction is approximately US$170 million.
    Although this cost is estimated in US dollars, it is not to be paid in US dollars. As for foreign exchange, approximately one-third of the cost of the new construction project is foreign exchange, approximately four-fifths of the cost of the expanded project is foreign exchange, and approximately seven-tenths of the cost of the transmission and substation equipment is foreign exchange. In this way, the foreign exchange cost required for our initial construction of one million kilowatts of hydropower is only more than 80 million US dollars.
    Approximately 30% of the US$90 million used domestically is used to pay wages, and the remaining 70% is used to purchase materials.
    Of course, it is neither reasonable nor reliable to estimate our domestic expenses in US dollars. Here, I am only proposing a standard for the convenience of calculation, and I will list some real numbers of materials and labor needed to supplement it later.
    The main materials used in hydropower projects include cement, steel, wood, copper, aluminum, etc. The list is as follows:
    Table 4: Table of Materials Required for Initial Hydropower Construction
    Cement  800,000 tons
    Steel  100,000 tons
    Wood  500,000 cubic meters
    Copper  3,000 tons
    Aluminum  5,000 tons
    The initial hydropower construction requires approximately 50 million man-days of labor. If calculated based on five years and 200 working days per year, approximately 50,000 people are required to participate in this construction work regularly.
    Accurate engineering estimates should be based on actual plans. The above figures are estimated based on general numbers and may differ from actual needs. Detailed research and calculations should be carried out in the future.

　　论新中国的水力建设
    程学敏
    一、水力建设的新展望
    水是地球上最重要物质之一，和人类生活关系最为密切。我们研究人类对于水的控制和利用，也就可以看出人类对于大自然的斗争和人类社会发展的历史。在原始的共产主义社会中，人类对于水的力量非但不能利用，而且根本无法控制。所以在上古的神话和传说中，关于“水患”的故事很多。那时候人类对于水患的唯一方法是逃避。到封建的农业社会形成，人类与土地的关系渐渐固定，人们为了保护他们的田地和住屋不受水淹，就有了“防水”、“治水”的方法。同时最简单的灌溉和水力的利用（如筒车汲水）也渐渐开始了。但是在农业社会自给自足的经济体系中，资本的累积和集中还很少，大规模的“水利”工程也不会发展。从“水患”“防水”“治水”和“水利”等名词的陆续在历史中出现，说明了人类从认识自然到改造自然和利用自然的演进。十八世纪产业革命，蒸气机的发明刺激了资本主义工业社会的发展，而发展了的工业又需要更大量的原动力。电的发明使蒸气动力的应用更为普遍，而水力发电的成功更使动力的供应增加了无比的泉源。于是随着远距离输电技术的改进，在过去这四、五十年中，水力工程建设就在资本主义的世界中突飞猛进。甚至在资本主义崩溃的前夕，严重的经济恐慌过程中，美国总统罗斯福著名的新政措施，还想利用大规模的水力工程建设来解决它一部分内在的矛盾。这种企图当然不会成功的，可是也证明了大规模的水力工程建设确是大量增加生产力的最有效的方法之一。它的影响，不仅在工业上，同时对于农业、交通以及整个的经济生活和文化生活都是有利的。因而产生了所谓“多元工程”这个名词。
    “多元工程”的涵义是说：当我们开发某一条河流的时候，我们所着眼的，不仅是它的水力的利用，同时也要顾到其他各方面的利益和作用。计划工程的时候，要考虑到各方面的配合运用，以一个或一组工程建筑来达到多样的目标。使整个工程为一有机体，各种作用相辅相成，以取得最高的经济价值，这是人类对于控制自然利用资源的方法和观念上的一个大进步。美国的大苦力、波尔多、ＴＶＡ，苏联的第聂泊，大伏尔加等等，都是“多元工程”的实例。
    在资本主义社会中，一切经济活动的唯一目标是利润的追求。可是在我上面所说的多元工程建设中，有若干利益（如防洪、航运、卫生、游览等）是无法以金钱来计算的，因而也就不容易以出售、收税或其他方法来转变为利润的。所以对于这些利益，资本家是不感兴趣的，于是只得由政府来经营。可是这就发生了下列三点矛盾：第一、这样大的事业由政府来经营是违反了资本主义私营自由企业（Ｆｒｅｅ　Ｅｎｔｅｒｐｒｉｓｅ）的金科玉律的。第二、代表资本家利益的政府，即使是有一部分人愿意花钱来建设这些大规模的工程，却不一定能得到它的后台老板唯利是图的资本家的支持。第三、在政府手中的多元工程，仍有一部分是企业性的，常和私人企业发生竞争，引起冲突。所以多元工程在资本主义政府的手中也不能得到充分的发展。
    我们看到这样巨大的自然力量，人类虽然开始学会了怎样去利用它，可是由于社会经济制度的束缚，这种生产力不能解放出来，更不能使它为大多数人群而工作。这个根本上的矛盾，必得要到新的社会经济制度下方能得到统一。
    如中国的三峡多元工程计划，可以发出一千多万千瓦的电力，灌溉六千万亩的土地，改善一千多公里的航道，长江下游的洪水可以大为减小，沿江多少城市可以得到充分的用水。这个计划在半殖民地半封建的社会只是一个讽刺，是无法实现的。就是实现了也没有意义：大量廉价的电力可能造成几个大资本家，大规模的灌溉只是便宜了一些大地主。增加了他们的财富，不过使他们更有力地剥削大多数人民而已。可是在新民主主义的社会里，这个计划的涵义就会不同了。一千万千瓦的电力，相当于一万万人的劳动力，就是说我们建设新社会的工作中，将增加一支等于一万万人的劳动力无日无夜地帮助我们工作。这对于提高我们全国人民的生活，促进我们理想社会的实现，将发出多么大的作用！这又是多么美妙的计划呢！
    　　　　二、中国的水力资源
    我国境内各河流所蕴蓄的水力资源，过去的估计是二千万千瓦到四千万千瓦。这个估计资料不完全，失之过低。最近较具体的估计是一亿三千六百七十余万千瓦（全国水力发电工程总处一九四七年估计），这个数字虽然仍是不完全的，但比较起初的估计已经增加了四倍多。这些水力资源的分布，列如下表：
    表一：
    中国水力资源之分布流域  　蕴蓄水力（万千瓦）　　备注一、长江流域  八，二七○二、黄河流域  一，八六○三、东北诸河流  六四○四、华北诸河流  五○五、珠江流域  三七○六、浙闽诸河流  一九○七、台湾及海南岛  二八○八、横断山脉间河流  一○  资料极不完全九、雅鲁藏布江流域　　二，○○○  资料极不完全十、新疆诸内陆河流  三  资料极不完全总计  　一三，六七三
    这个数字同世界其他重要水力国家比较起来，则列如表二：
    表二：中、苏、美水力资源之比较  水力资源（万千瓦）　平均每人国别　
　利用时间为百分　利用时间为百分　人口（万）　　所得水力之九十五之流量　之五十之流量  　　资源（千瓦）苏联　五，八五○　二八，一○○　一六，八○○　一·六七美国　四，○五○　六，九○○　一四，一○○　○·九四中国  一三，六七○　四七，○○○　○·二九国别　　备注苏联　　第三次世界动力会议报告数字美国    同上中国　　全国水力发电工程总处估计
    据表可见中国水力资源的蕴藏量是相当丰富的。虽然平均每人所得蕴藏量仍不如苏美，但是比较旁的资源如煤铁等的情形，则是有利多了。
    这些蕴蓄的水力资源中，曾经为我们开发了多少呢？说也可怜，只有五十多万千瓦，不到千分之四。而其中绝大多数是在东北和台湾，是日本帝国主义为了加强它的压榨，加强它侵略性的军火工业而开展的。
    表三：中国已开发水力资源表地区　开发量　（千瓦）　百分数　　备注东北　三四○·○○○　　六四·四　最近数字恐有改变台湾　一七四·○○○　　三三·一其他　一二·○○○　二·三共计　五二六·○○○　一○○
    在半封建半殖民地的社会中，水力资源的开发当然是不被重视的，巨大的资源只有随它浪费掉。新民主主义建设的主要任务是提高我们的生产力，水力资源的开发当然就要大规模地进行起来，使我们雄伟充沛的水力得到解放。
　　三、水力建设在中国经济中的地位
    中国在新民主主义下的经济建设，我觉得她将会逐步走向计划性的。整个的经济建设，事前要有一个整套的计划。在纵的方面讲：自资本的累积，投资的分配，生产的方式，成品的运销，直到最后的消费，整个过程都先要经过通盘的考虑。在横的方面讲：各种建设事业间的连系，其相助相成的作用，一定要有密切的配合。个别地看，各项建设可以分工并进，可是合起来则应是一个骨肉均匀比例相称的有机体，水力建设的多元化，其本身就具有计划性。在整个经济建设中的地位也就特别重要。世界上有许多区域性的经济建设，都是以一个或一组水力建设来构成它的骨干的。拟具计划的专家们往往发现水力建设在整个建设中有提纲挈领的作用，因而有形成一种所谓“销钥计划”（Ｋｅｙ　ｐｌｃｎ）的趋向。
    中国水力建设计划是中国整个经济建设的一部分。所以当我们研究水力建设的时候，必需先看看整个经建计划的轮廊。全面性的中国建设计划，过去各方面的专家们虽然有种种的建议，但到现在还没有具体的拟定。作者在这里不想多加讨论，只就大体上略加介绍：
    过去各位研究全国性经建计划的专家们，差不多一致地认为区域性的经济建设是最合理和最有效的。根据地理上和经济上的差别性和连系性，把全国分成若干区，各区有各区的重点和特性。一方面为了经济上的需要，要提倡区域分工。另一方面为了国防上的考虑，又要注意适当的区域自给。这样来推展全国的经济建设，应当是无可非议的。
    关于区域的分法，各家观点虽不完全相同，但大体上的意见是可以统一的。主要区域约有下列各区：
    一、东北区
    二、华北区
    三、西北区
    四、华中区
    五、西南区
    六、东南区
    大体上讲，东北区、华北区、和西南区，都将成为中国主要的重工业区域。西北区、华中区、和东南区则将成为比较注重轻工业和农业的区域。
    不论是重工业或轻工业，都有一个共同的需要，那就是原动力。最现代化的原动力就是电力。电力的产生除了上面所说的水力发电以外，还可有几种不同的方式，就是燃煤，燃油，利用风力和利用太阳的热力等等。后面三种方式的大规模应用，现在还不普遍。至于用煤来发电的电厂（或称火力发电厂）则是非常多的了。水力发电和火力发电之间，存在着极尖锐的竞争。关于水力发电和火力发电的优劣和比较，专家们所发表的言论已经是太多了，在这里也不想再加申述。
    实际上，水力发电和火力发电是优劣互见，相济相成而不可偏废的。所以现在一般的主张水力火力联合运用为最经济的原动力来源。火力发电发展较早，历史较长，但最近各国的动力建设又似乎多特重水力发电，其原因大约如下：
    第一、是由于多元工程的应用，减低了水力的成本，又增加了其他的利益，使工程经济的计算更为有利。
    第二、因为水力建设的大部分费用，是用在人工和土木建筑方面，是用在国内的。不象火力发电厂，大部分费用花在机器方面，这种机器，在技术落后的国家是必需以外汇来向外国去买的。用在国内的建设费用，还可以刺激国内的工业发展，所以又是一举两得的。
    第三、根据欧美各国的统计数字，火力发电和水力发电建筑费用（不是成本）之比大约是一百比一百六十。在生产较落后的国家，人工和若干建筑材料比较低廉，而机器则由于输入的关系比较昂贵。所以这两者的建筑费用可能相差不大。而且水力电厂的建筑费受天然形势的影响很大，优越的水力地址和不优越的水力地址其建筑费可以相差四、五倍，在工业落后国家中，首先开发的大多是比较优越的水力地址，它的建筑费可能很低，因而同火力电厂比较起来也就更为有利。
    第四是由于战后世界煤荒的严重，在短期内没有改善的希望。一方面煤的产量减少，而另一方面煤的用途却日日增大，因而大部分国家都希望把这无尽的资源——水——来尽量开发利用，而把那有限的资源——煤——来尽量节省和保存起来。
    上述四点，在我们研究中国经济建设计划的时候，也是应当特别考虑到的。当然这并不是说，此后中国的动力问题，将完全由水力建设来负担。只是在前述种种条件之下，当我们解决某一地区的动力问题时，水力的利用，是应当得到优先的考虑的。在这里，我们当然不能抹煞火力发电在整个电力网中的地位，和水、火联合运用的重要性。
　　四、中国初期水力建设＠议
    前面已经讲过，中国的水力建设，应当配合在整个的中国经建计划里面。现在全面性的建设还没有具体的方案可以参考，这时候草拟所谓“水力计划”是多少有点“闭门造车”式的。但事实上我们不能等待，因为全面性的建设计划往往是根据各个单独计划再加以调整和统一而来的。所以这里还是大胆地提出了一个极初步的建议。
    计划的意义，主要的固然在透视到将来，但根本上是必需从现实出发的。我们建设的目标是一个高度工业化的新中国，而现在国内大部分地区，农业生产的技术都还是极落后的。除了华北和东北，在那里，重工业建设可以说是已经开始，但其他地方则很差。在这样的现实基础上提出我们的初期建设计划，我们当然要考虑到各个区域工业化程度的高低和建设程序的差异。所以在东北，我们要注意从现有的基础上扩充。在华北，我们要开始打基础。而在其他地区，则我们也许还需要一些改造和过渡的时间，才能开始计划性的建设。这样我们对于每一个地区的建设计划，性质上就有不同，而时间上自然就有参差。大体上讲，本文中所谓“初期”，是指今后这五年到十年的时间里。
    东北的水力建设，过去“水主火从”的原则大体上是对的，就以已造成的小丰满，水丰和镜泊湖三个水力工程而论，全部容量已可超过一百万千瓦（水丰是和北朝鲜共同使用）。但是现装的发电设备，不过三、四十万千瓦，小丰满和水丰两处的水坝工程都需要改善，我们初期的建设计划，应当一方面把工程上有问题的水坝赶快修好，同时积极地恢复和扩充这几处的发电输电和变电容量。
    华北重工业建设的条件，甚至比东北还好。如钢铁和化工业的建设，可以说是已经在开始了。现在华北的十多万千瓦动力，完全是火力发电。就华北丰富的煤矿而论，火力发电的条件当然比较有利。但是华北的许多河流，由于旱涝的不均，急需建造大量的水库，来减少洪水，增加灌溉。有了水库，水力的利用，便成为一种副产品，以副产品的形式来利用华北的水力，自然是值得提倡的。何况在滹沱河、拒马河的上游，还有许多确实优良的水力地址，即主要地为水力而开发也有利的。最近可以开发的工程，有北拒马河的紫荆关，和滦河的罗马屯等等。
    西北农业的主要问题是“水”，在我们解决西北农业用水问题的时候，同时也就可以开发水力。西北的工业中心，现在是在兰州、西安、宝鸡等处，我们要建设西北，最好先从这几个地方着手。黄河朱喇嘛峡和渭河宝鸡峡的开发，可以供给兰州和宝鸡工业生产的动力，可以列入初期建设计划里面。
    西南的煤极缺少，而其他资源丰富，重工业的建设极有希望。可惜到现在还没有一点基础。对于西南的建设，作者建议先建设一些附近工业条件优良的城市，成为将来发展的据点，再由此建立起大规模的工业区域。如此，初期的水力建设可包括重庆附近的龙溪河，乐山附近的大渡河、马边河、昆明附近的螳螂川等工程。
    一般讲来，华中区的水力资源是配不上这区域的工业比重的。但是在华中动力建设的前途中，有一个三峡工程。三峡工程在过去看来是硕大无比近于空想的计划。但是我们看到苏联建设的成绩，有许多远大的计划，最初被资本主义国家所怀疑，讽刺，甚至于讥笑的，到后来，由于工业建设动量的急速增加，这些计划都变成实际的合理的和确当的计划了。我们对于三峡工程，也要有这样的看法。当然，三峡工程在最近是不会开工的，华中区初期的水力建设可以注意湖南的资水，那里有离开长沙株州等工业中心最近最大的水力地址。
    东南区的工业，现在还集中在沿海几个大城市里。为了发展东南区的工业，应当把这些大城市的工业先扩充起来。初期的水力建设，如广州附近的＠江，福州附近的古田和上海附近的钱塘江等，都可以考虑开发的。
    根据上面的分析，作者建议在此后这五年到十年内，在水力建设方面，我们至少要在东北恢复和扩充五十万千瓦。在其他地区新建五十万千瓦。再加上必要的输电和变电的设备。至于全国性的水力资源调查和勘测工作，以及其他重要水力工程的规划和设计工作，我们也要积极进行，作为以后更大规模水力建设的准备。
    中国水力建设费用的估计，现在还没有充分的资料可以参考，根据美国的统计，每千瓦水力的建设费用平均约为一七五美元（Ｂｏｒｒｏｗ氏统计）。而日本的数字则是每千瓦三二二日元（日本电气学会统计），约合为每千瓦一百美元。中国的数字应当和日本比较接近。宽裕些算，拟定为每千瓦一二○美元。但是以上的根据都是一九四○年以前的统计，考虑到这九年美元的贬值，这数字至少还应当加上百分之七十，即约为每千瓦二○○美元。其中机电设备约为百分之四十，即为每千瓦八○美元。如此我们所要新建的五十万千瓦约需建筑费一亿美元。扩充的五十万千瓦约需四千万美元。输电和变电设备方面，估计约需三千万美元。总共初期水力建设的费用，约合一亿七千万美元。
    这笔费用，虽然以美元来估计的，但并不是要以美元来支付。至于外汇，在新建工程中，大约有三分之一的费用是外汇，在扩充的工程中，大约有五分之四的费用是外汇，输电和变电设备中，大约有十分之七的费用是外汇。如此算来，我们初期建设一百万千瓦水力所需的外汇费只有八千多万美金。
    用在国内的九千万美金中，大约有百分之三十是用来付给工资的，其余的百分之七十则是用来购买材料的。
    当然用美金来估计我们国内的费用，既不合理，亦不可靠。这里只不过为计算方便而提出个标准，后面再列一些实在需要的材料和人工的数字以为补充。
    水力工程所用的主要材料有洋灰、钢铁、木材、铜、铝等。列表如下：
    表四：初期水力建设所需材料表洋灰　八十万吨钢铁　十万吨木材　五十万立方公尺铜　　三千吨铝　　五千吨
    初期水力建设约需人工五千万工，如以五年的时间计算，每年工作日数以二百天计算，约需五万人经常地参加这项建设工作。
    精确的工程估计，应当根据实际的计划。以上的数字是根据概数估计的，和实际的需要可能有出入，以后应当再按详细的研究计算。
