[Beijing News] The following is an abstract of the supplementary report on the financial and economic work of Beijing in the past six months by Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu at the second day (August 10th) morning session of the Beijing All-Circles Representative Conference:

Regarding the work of the Municipal Government in the past six months and its future policies, Mayor Ye already gave a report to the conference yesterday. I am now only giving a supplementary report on three financial and economic issues that Mayor Ye did not mention. These three issues are fiscal revenue, prices, and banking operations.

(1) Fiscal Revenue

(1) Financial situation:

There is a significant gap between revenue and expenditure in the city's finances. On the expenditure side, the scope of the suburban areas under the city's jurisdiction has expanded; some institutions that were originally under the so-called direct control of the central government during the Kuomintang reactionary government era, such as the tax bureau and the courts, have been placed under the city's management. In particular, the reception of the huge bureaucratic apparatus, and the severance pay and training of personnel, require a large amount of funding. Most importantly, roads, waterways, public houses, etc., were never repaired by the Kuomintang reactionary government, and we must gradually repair them. Also, educating the broad masses of young people and carrying out sanitary construction all require funding, so expenditures have increased month by month. In the first half of the year, a total of 42.75 million catties of millet were spent (excluding the expenses of the army, universities, the Military Control Commission, and local funds). On the revenue side, it mainly relies on tax revenue. In the first half of the year, a total of 18.69 million catties of millet were collected. This also increased month by month due to the recovery of industry and commerce and the rectification of tax collection work. Compared with revenue and expenditure, there was a deficit of 24.06 million catties, accounting for 56.27 percent of the total expenditure, that is, the income only accounts for 43.73 percent of the total expenditure. This deficit relies on subsidies from the North China People's Government, which means that the expenses of Beijing currently require farmers in the North China Liberated Area to bear a part.

The estimated expenditure for the second half of the year is 95.07 million catties of millet, more than double that of the first half of the year. Among them, recurring expenses account for 47.75 percent of the total expenditure, education, health, construction and other operating expenses account for 40.18 percent, and reserve funds account for 12.07 percent. There are two reasons why the estimated expenditure has increased: one is that the second half of the year has one more month than the first half of the year, and the second is that operating expenses have increased. Operating expenses were less in the first half of the year, and the increase in operating expenses is necessary for the construction of Beijing.

The above belongs to the scope of expenditure from North China funds. In addition, the expenses within the scope of local funds are approximately 1 million catties per month for the expenses of municipal primary schools in the city, and more than 600,000 catties per month for the expenses of village offices and village primary schools in the suburbs, totaling approximately 19 million catties per year. The temporary expenses for cleaning up garbage are approximately 2 million catties per year. The above totals approximately 20 million catties per year. The administrative and operational fees collected in the past have been suspended. The expenses for primary schools are temporarily covered by North China funds, and 23.732 million yuan has already been advanced.

(2) Tax Revenue Situation:

The Kuomintang reactionary government levied very heavy taxes and miscellaneous fees. The burden on merchants was as high as 85.9 percent of the regular tax for those with heavy burdens, and 28.8 percent for those with light burdens, averaging 58 percent. After liberation, we should have thoroughly reformed it according to the financial policy of "developing production, ensuring supply, promoting economic prosperity, and taking into account both public and private interests." However, because the reform of the tax system must be carefully studied and cannot be arbitrarily changed by one city, we only temporarily retained 16 of the 24 tax items that were relatively reasonable and continued to collect them, abolishing the remaining 8. At the same time, in order to implement the development of production and promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, it was specifically stipulated that small-scale handicrafts, special handicrafts manufacturing, etc. are exempt from business tax; the business tax rate for industrial machinery manufacturing, etc. is reduced to 1 percent; all city gate tax checkpoints are abolished; the tax rate for food, cotton, oil, pears, dates, and melons for five types of merchants is changed from 3 percent to 1.5 percent; those who carry goods on their shoulders for sale with a total value of less than 20,000 yuan, and small-scale handicraft producers who produce and sell their own products, are exempt from taxation.

Our tax collection work has been generally fair and reasonable because democratic evaluation has been generally adopted, and tax workers are generally said to be hardworking and honest.

(3) Opinions on Future Financial Work

In order to support the front lines, build a new Beijing, and carry out various necessary construction projects for economic, cultural, educational, health, and municipal affairs, we must thoroughly reorganize tax collection and strengthen tax collection work under the principle of fairness and rationality, and strengthen the management of public real estate to strive to increase revenue. In addition, public enterprises will also have considerable revenue in the future to supply financial expenditures. On the other hand, we must greatly reduce the burden on farmers to the city, and therefore we must conscientiously implement streamlining, saving, tightening staffing, streamlining institutions, saving expenses, preventing waste, opposing extravagance, and maintaining and promoting a hardworking and simple style in order to accumulate capital and rapidly restore and develop production.

(2) Price Issues:

Beijing is a consumer city, not a producer city. In such a city, price issues have always been serious issues. Before liberation, we had already noticed this and decided to supply Beijing with sufficient materials to avoid drastic price fluctuations, concentrating 30 million catties of grain, 280,000 catties of white oil, and 70,000 tons of coal in the suburbs of Beijing. After liberation, we immediately stabilized prices actively and steadily by directly supplying laboring citizens at fair prices through cooperatives and retail stores. This has kept Beijing's prices stable for a considerable period after liberation. By the end of July, a total of 52,389,174 catties of grain had been supplied, and including supplies to the market and suburbs, the total reached 137.9 million catties, supplying 140,000 bolts of cloth and 113,000 bundles of yarn, ensuring that the laboring people obtained daily necessities at fair prices.

Prices fluctuated once in the second half of April, but after efforts to stabilize them, they soon stabilized. Entering July, prices fluctuated sharply again. Initially, it was mainly affected by price fluctuations in Shanghai and the northward movement of speculative capital. However, after the second half of July, Beijing's prices exceeded Shanghai's and continued to rise. In the past few days, they have begun to decline under our efforts to stabilize them. Obviously, in July, the main factor in Beijing's price fluctuations was no longer external influences, but the mischief of speculative capital, that is, the speculative capital that came north from Shanghai and the local speculative capital in Beijing colluded together to engage in speculation and disrupt the market. Currently, there are the following types of speculative activities:

1. Purchasing and storing materials, hoarding and refusing to sell. Some grain merchants purchase and store yarn and cloth, cloth merchants sell cloth and invest in cotton yarn, grain, and gold, buying and selling back and forth. Rice and flour shops purchase and store large quantities of wheat and miscellaneous grains, exceeding the scope of their retail and processing business.

2. Buying and selling short. For example, cloth and yarn merchants use "running contracts" to buy first and sell later, or sell first and buy later, to speculate on price fluctuations and seek exorbitant profits.

3. Cashing out materials. Some grain stations use other grain stores to cash out the trading company's grain. Some only pay a deposit when purchasing, and then sell the approval slip to others, specializing in driving up prices and taking advantage of it.

4. Individual public stores, organizational production, and cooperatives also rush to purchase materials, using any means to make a profit.

The above speculative activities disregard the interests of the country and the people and violate the laws of the People's Government and must not be allowed to continue to exist. We are strengthening market management and strictly inspecting speculative activities. We hope that the people will assist us. In order to fundamentally solve the price problem, on the one hand, we must develop production, and on the other hand, we must practice thrift and economy.

(3) Banking Operations:

The characteristics of the Kuomintang reactionary government's financial institutions were to engage in monopolistic speculation and encourage speculation, which was divorced from production. The central task of our People's Bank is to serve production and vigorously support production. In addition, it is entrusted by the government to perform financial management work.

The main work done by the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank in the past seven months is:

(1) Loans: As of the end of July, the cumulative amount of loans to public enterprises, including public utilities, industry and mining, trade, and cultural undertakings, totaled more than 4.9 billion, and the actual balance is now 1.5 billion after deducting those that have been recovered. Loans to private enterprises totaled 250 million yuan, including more than 91 million yuan for industry, 51 million yuan for mining, 47 million yuan for export packaging loans, 27 million yuan for special handicrafts, 28 million yuan for cultural and educational undertakings, and 2 million yuan for commerce. The result of implementing loans is, first, to help the recovery and development of public enterprises, and second, to support private industry and mining, special handicrafts, and exporters. In addition, a contract loan method was tested to solve the difficulties of private enterprises in raw materials, markets, and continued reproduction.

(2) Real Value Savings Deposits: From April 1st to July 27th, this type of savings deposit absorbed more than 400 million yuan. This business is relatively loss-making in the banking business. However, it has played a certain role in absorbing speculative capital. These savings deposits can be invested in production loans for a longer period to develop production. At the same time, it also guarantees the value of savings for some basic masses (mainly workers, students, and public employees), so that they can avoid the impact of currency devaluation.

(3) Financial Management: First, 1 billion gold yuan coupons were all redeemed, of which 500 million yuan was preferential treatment, with each person redeeming 500 yuan, that is, 1 million people were treated preferentially, accounting for one-half of Beijing citizens. Second, the buying and selling of gold and silver was prohibited, and the management of raw gold and silver and silver dollars resulted in the cracking of 31 black market strongholds for gold and silver, and 22 major cases. Third, 125 gold shops, accounting for one-half of all gold shops, were helped to change industries, and gold and silver in gold shops were redeemed at preferential prices close to the market price, totaling 301 taels of gold and 94,411 taels of silver. Fourth, the management of private firms and banks implemented capital verification, re-registration, and capital verification.

　　张友渔副市长在北平各界代表会议上
    关于北平市半年来财经工作补充报告摘要
    【平市讯】北平市各界代表会议第二日（八月十日）上午，张友渔副市长关于北平市半年来财经工作的补充报告摘要如下：
    关于市政府半年来的工作及今后方针，叶市长昨日已在大会报告，我现在只是就财经工作中，叶市长所未谈到的三个问题，作一补充报告。这三个问题就是财政税收问题、物价问题、和银行工作问题。
    （一）财政税收问题
    （１）财政状况：
    本市财政，收支相差颇巨。开支方面，由于市属郊区范围扩大；国民党反动政府时代原属所谓中央直辖的一些机关如税局，法院等，划归市管，特别是接收了庞大的官僚机构，人员的资遣和训练，需要一笔很大经费；最主要的是马路、水道、公有房屋等，国民党反动政府从未修理，而我们则须逐渐加以修理，还有教育广大青年，进行卫生建设，也都需要经费，所以逐月增加了。前半年计共支出小米四千二百七十五万斤（不包括军队、大学、军管会经费及地方款开支）。收入方面，主要是依靠税收。前半年计共收小米一千八百六十九万斤。也是由于工商业的恢复和税收工作的整顿而逐月增加了的。收支相较，实亏二千四百零六万斤，占总支出的百分之五十六点二七，亦即收入只相当总支出的百分之四十三点七三。这笔亏款依靠华北人民政府拨款补助，也就是目前北平开支还需要华北解放区农民担负一部分。
    下半年的支出概算共计小米九千五百零七万斤。较前半年增加一倍以上。其中经常费占总支出的百分之四十七点七五，教育、卫生、建设等事业费占百分之四十点一八，预备费占百分之十二点零七。支出概算所以增加，有二个原因，一是下半年比前半年多一个月，二是事业费增加了。前半年事业费较少，事业费的增加，在北平的建设上是必要的。
    以上属于华北款开支范围。此外属于地方款开支范围的，为城市内市立小学经费每月约一百万斤，郊区村公所，村小学经费每月约六十多万斤，全年约计一千九百余万斤，清扫垃圾的临时费，全年开支约二百万斤，以上年计共约二千万斤。过去所征收的行政事业费已停征。现在小学经费暂用华北款垫支，已垫二三、七三二万元。
    （２）税收状况：
    国民党反动政府时代苛捐杂税甚重。商号负担苛杂多者达正税的百分之八五点九，少者百分之二八点八，平均百分之五八。解放后本应根据“发展生产、保证供给、繁荣经济、公私兼顾”的财政政策加以彻底改革，但因税制的改革必须慎重研究，且不是一城一市所能单独任意改变，所以只暂将过去二十四种税目中比较合理的十六种保留下来，继续征收，废除其余八种。同时为了贯彻发展生产并促进城乡物资交流，特规定小型手工业、特种手工艺制造业等免纳营业税；工业机器业制造业等的营业税税率减低为百分之一；撤消各城门税卡；粮食、棉花、油料、梨枣、瓜果五种行商税税率由百分之三改为百分之一点五；肩挑负贩售货总值不足两万元者，及自产自销的小手工业者，均予免征。
    我们的税收工作，由于一般采取了民主评议，而税工人员一般地说也还算艰苦廉洁，所以做到了大体上公平合理。
    （３）今后财政工作意见
    为了支援前线、建设新北平，进行经济、文化、教育、卫生、市政各种必需的建设事业，必须在公平合理的原则下彻底整理税收，加强税收工作，并加强公有房地产管理，以努力增加收入。此外，公营企业将来亦有相当收入，供给财政开支。另一方面，必须大大减轻农民对城市的负担，因而也就必须认真实行精简节约、紧缩编制、精干机构、节省开支、防止浪费、反对铺张、保持与提倡艰苦朴素作风，以期积累资本，迅速恢复与发展生产。
    （二）物价问题：
    北平是一个消费城市，而不是生产城市。在这样的城市，物价问题向来是严重的问题。在解放前，我们便曾注意到这一点，决定对北平供应相当充分的物资以避免物价的剧烈波动，在平郊集中粮食三千万斤，白油二十八万斤，煤筋七万吨。解放后即以公平价格通过合作社、零售店直接供应劳动市民积极平稳物价。这就使得北平物价在解放后一个相当长的时期中，保持了平稳状态。到七月底止，共计供应粮食五千二百三十八万九千一百七十四斤，连同供给市场及郊区等，则达一亿三千七百九十万斤，供应布十四万匹，纱十一万三千捆，保证了劳动人民以公平价格获得生活必需品。
    四月下半月，物价曾有一度波动，经努力平抑，不久即趋稳定。进入七月，物价又激烈波动。开始，主要是受上海物价波动，游资北移的影响。但到七月下旬以后，北平物价超过上海，并继续上涨。最近几天则在我们努力平抑下开始下降。很明显，七月份，北平物价波动的主要因素已不是外来影响，而是游资作祟，即上海北来的游资和北平本地的游资，勾结一起进行了投机倒把、扰乱市场的活动。目前投机活动有如下几种：
    １、购存物资，囤积拒售，有些粮商购存纱布，布商将布卖掉，投向棉纱、粮食、黄金，来回倒卖，米面粮店大批购存小麦杂粮，超过其零售与加工的业务范围。
    ２、买空卖空。如布匹、纱布商利用跑合的先买后卖，或先卖后买，从涨落中投机，牟取暴利。
    ３、套购物资。有些粮栈利用其他粮店套购贸易公司粮食，有的仅在购买时付交定款，转手即将批单卖给他人，专门哄抬物价，从中取利。
    ４、个别公营商店、机关生产及合作社也抢购物资，为赚利而不择手段。
    以上各种投机活动，不顾国家与人民的利益，违反人民政府法令，必不能允许其继续存在。我们正在加强市场管理，严格检查投机活动。希望人民协助。为了根本解决物价问题，一方面必须发展生产，他方面，必须厉行节约。
    （三）银行工作问题：
    国民党反动政府的金融机构的特点是进行垄断性的投机与助长投机而与生产脱节。我们人民银行则中心工作是为生产服务，大力扶植生产。此外，并受政府委托，执行金融管理工作。
    人民银行北平分行七个月来所做的工作，主要的是：
    （１）贷款：截至七月底止，公营企业贷款的累积数，包括公用、工矿、贸易及文化事业等共四十九亿多，除已收回者外，现在实际余额为十五亿。私营企业贷款共二亿五千万元。计工业九千一百余万元，矿业五千一百万元，出口打包放款四千七百万元，特种手工艺二千七百万元，文化教育事业二千八百万元，商业二百万元。实行贷款的结果，第一，帮助了公营企业的恢复与发展，第二，扶助了私营工矿业、特种手工业及出口商。此外，又试办了定货贷款办法，解决了私营企业原料、市场与继续再生产的困难。
    （２）折实储蓄存款：四月一日到七月二十七日共吸收此项储蓄存款四亿多。在银行营业项目中，这项营业是比较吃亏的。但在吸收游资上，起了一定作用。这些储蓄存款可较长期地投入生产贷款中去，以发展生产。同时也保证了一部分基本群众（主要是工人、学生、公教人员）的储蓄保值，使他们避免受货币贬值影响。
    （３）金融管理：第一、曾经全数收兑了十亿金元券，其中五亿元是受优待的，每人兑五百元，即受优待者一百万人，为北平市民的二分之一。第二、禁止了金银买卖，管理生金银、银元，共破获金银黑市据点三十一处，较大案件二十二起。第三、帮助了占全部金店二分之一的一百二十五家金店转业，以优待接近市价的价格收兑金店金银，计黄金三○一两，白银九四四一一两。第四、管理私营行庄，实行了验资，重新登记，检验资本。
