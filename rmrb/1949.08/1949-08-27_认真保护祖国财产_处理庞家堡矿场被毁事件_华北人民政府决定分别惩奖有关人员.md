  　Handling the Destruction of the Pangjiabu Mine
    North China People's Government Decides to Punish and Reward Relevant Personnel

    [Reported by this newspaper] Following the destruction of the Pangjiabu Mine of the Xuanhua Longyan Iron Mine, the North China People's Supervisory Yuan dispatched Supervisory Commissioner Wu Guanghua and others, together with personnel from the Enterprise Department and the Public Security Department, to investigate and report to the North China People's Government. The North China People's Government has made the following decisions regarding this serious destructive event and the relevant departments and personnel involved:

    Regarding the destruction of the Pangjiabu Mine of the Xuanhua Longyan Iron Mine, after instructions from this government, the Chahar Province Charnan Sub-district and its subordinate county and city government organs, as well as the Longyan Iron Mine, have successively conducted inspections and have begun to implement specific measures for mine protection. To strictly enforce rewards and punishments and further promote and implement future mine protection work, this government has made the following decisions regarding the relevant departments and personnel involved, based on the severity of their merits and demerits:

    1.  Zhang Shijie, the original person in charge of the Longyan Iron Mine after takeover, from the date of takeover, initially abandoned management, and then paid insufficient attention to it, neglecting supervision, and failing to fulfill his duties. However, considering that this member has achieved some results in leading the resumption of production, he is given a demerit (major) as a punishment. Ma Shuqian, the mine manager, took office in April and arrived in June. Although it was a short time, this member originally served as the head of the Enterprise Takeover Team of the Zhangjiakou Military Control Commission and was the direct leader of the mine. Furthermore, the dismantling of the high-voltage line on May 13 was also agreed to by this member, so he is undoubtedly responsible and should be given a demerit (major) as a punishment.

    2.  Although Liu Dequn, the former Nankou Commissioner, had assigned cadres to investigate the Pangjiabu Mine once at the beginning of the provincial order to protect the mine, he showed a serious attitude of indulgence towards the government's serious relations with Longguan in the work of mine protection. Not only did he fail to correct it, but he also issued an order on May 6, criticizing and restricting the collection of copper as "enemy knowledge," unconditionally clearing obstacles for copper merchants, resulting in the saying that "buying copper is not illegal" in Longguan. Therefore, Commissioner Liu Dequn should be given a warning. Although this member has been transferred, the provincial government should still inform him for educational purposes.

    3.  Fan Ziping, the head of Longguan County, showed a negligent and confrontational attitude at the beginning of the provincial order to protect the mine due to ideological errors. Although his thinking has changed somewhat under repeated instructions from the provincial government, he has not made significant achievements in specific work and should also be given a demerit as a punishment. The head of the Fifth District under his jurisdiction has consistently blindly emphasized the narrow and temporary interests of a few poor people, condoning theft, and seriously endangering the overall national people's property and interests. In order to effectively educate the district head and others, the Chahar Provincial Government should conduct further in-depth inspections and give them the punishments they deserve and publicize them.

    4.  Li Feng, the mayor of Xuanhua City, neglected his duties and showed an indulgent attitude from beginning to end in carrying out the task of purchasing copper and iron, leading to the destruction of the mine. He should be given a demerit as a punishment. Yao Ziming, the deputy chief of the Industry and Commerce Section under his jurisdiction, not only failed to fulfill his duties, but stubbornly insisted on his erroneous view of taking care of the families of staff members, ignoring policy principles, and ignoring the organized decision of the superior government trade organs to stop collecting, bearing important responsibility for the destruction of the mine. He should be dismissed from his post. Chen Fushun, the director of the Public Security Police Station in the Third District, and cadre Ma Qingyun, while investigating and arresting criminals selling high-voltage lines, also partnered with merchants to operate this item and arbitrarily issued road passes to Pinglu, knowingly violating the law. Furthermore, more than a thousand catties of high-voltage lines confiscated in their cases are still unaccounted for. Therefore, the cases of these two members should be handed over to the judicial organs for investigation and handled according to law.

    5.  Guo Yun, the former Commissioner of Charnan, neglected the provincial government's mine protection order and failed to supervise effectively. Considering that this member has achieved some results in handling thieves, he is only given a criticism.

    6.  Xing Yunzeng, the county head of Xuanhua County, failed to implement the provincial government's mine protection order in a timely and effective manner, causing Zhao Ke, a staff member of the Seventh District under his jurisdiction, to install a telephone in the district, arbitrarily ordering people to cut 160 catties of high-voltage lines, so that Dong Fa and other villagers of Lisi Mountain Village dared to repeatedly steal mine equipment. In addition to Zhao Ke being directly punished by his affiliated agency, County Head Xing Yunzeng should be given a warning.

    7.  The Chahar Power Branch Company and its Xuanhua City Office have repeatedly inspected the lines since February and reported to higher authorities. They also suggested to the responsible persons of the Xuanhua Municipal Government at the beginning of Xuanhua's liberation to collect scattered ammeters and other items from the people, which is considered to be a sign of attention to their duties. The loss of high-voltage lines this time was due to many reasons, and the lines were long, beyond the capacity of the company itself, so no punishment will be imposed.

    8.  The Chahar Provincial People's Government did not pay attention to the issue of mine protection at the beginning. After discovering the serious destruction of the mine, it only issued general instructions and orders prohibiting destruction, and failed to conduct on-site inspections and effective measures to stop the destruction in a timely manner, causing the mine to continue to be destroyed. In order to correct this bureaucratic style, Zhang Su, the chairman of the provincial government, should be given a criticism.

    9.  Cadres of Guchengzi Village in the Third District of Longguan and Li Mantang, director of the Tangchikou Farmers Association in the Fifth District, voluntarily armed themselves to protect the mine, captured criminals, and intercepted assets. The county government should investigate and record their merits separately and issue certificates of commendation to show praise.

　　认真保护祖国财产
  　处理庞家堡矿场被毁事件
    华北人民政府决定分别惩奖有关人员
    【本报讯】宣化龙烟铁矿庞家堡矿场遭受破坏事件，经华北人民监察院派监察专员武光华等，会同企业部、公安部派员前往调查呈报华北人民政府后，华北人民政府已对此严重破坏事件及有关部门与各该有关人员作出下列决定：
    关于宣化龙烟铁矿庞家堡矿场遭受破坏事件，经本府指示后，察哈尔省察南分区暨所属各县市政府机关及龙烟铁矿等均已先后分别作了检查，对于护矿工作的具体措施已开始分别着手进行。本府为严明奖惩，进一步的推动与贯彻今后护矿工作，特对此案有关部门及各该有关人员，分别功过的轻重大小，作如下决定：
    一、龙烟铁矿原接管负责人张士杰，对庞家堡矿场自接管之日起，始则放弃管理，继则重视不足，疏于看管，有失职守。惟念该员于复工生产领导上尚有成绩，姑予以记大过一次处分。该矿经理马叔乾四月任职，六月始到职，虽为时尚短，但该员原任张家口市军管会企业接管组长，为该矿直接领导者，且五月十三日拆卸高压线亦为该员所同意，自属责无旁贷，应予记大过一次处分。
    二、前南口专员刘德群虽于省令护矿之初，曾指派干部前往庞家堡矿山调查一次，但在护矿工作中对龙关系政府严重的放纵态度，不仅未能予以纠正，反于五月六日下令，指斥限制收铜为“敌人见识”，无条件为收铜商人扫清障碍，致造成龙关境有“买铜不犯法”之说。为此，应给该专员刘德群以警告处分。现该员虽已他调，仍应由省府转告，以资教育。
    三、龙关系长范子平于省令护矿之始，由于思想认识错误，表现玩忽对抗，嗣后虽在省府一再指示下，思想有所转变，惟在具体工作中，尚无显著成绩，亦应给予记过处分。其所属五区区长，一贯地盲目强调少数贫民狭隘的暂时的利益，纵容偷窃行为，严重地危害了整体国家人民财产与利益；为了有效地教育该区长等人，着察哈尔省府再行深入检查，予以应得处分并公布之。
    四、宣化市长李锋玩忽职守，在执行收购铜铁任务时，从始至终表示放纵态度，酿成对矿山之破坏，应给予记过处分。其所属工商科副科长姚子明不但不能克尽职守，反而固执本人照顾工作人员家属的错误主张，忽视政策原则，忽视上级政府贸易机关有组织的停收决定，对于矿山破坏负有重要责任，应予撤职处分。第三区公安派出所所长陈福顺、干事马清云，一边缉查商人贩卖高压线人犯，一边又与商人合伙经营该项物品，并擅自开给赴平路条，知法犯法，且其经手各案所没收之高压线有千余斤尚无下落。为此，应将该二员案情交司法机关讯明后依法处理。
    五、原察南专员郭韫忽视省府护矿命令，疏于督察，姑念该员对于盗犯处理尚有成绩，仅给以批评处分。
    六、宣化县长邢云增对省府护矿命令未能及时有效执行，致该县所属七区工作人员赵克为架设该区电话，竟擅自令人割取高压线一百六十斤，以致李寺山村村民董发等敢于一再偷盗矿山器材。除赵克应由所属机关直接处议外，该县长邢云增，应予警告处分。
    七、察中电业分公司及所属宣化市办事处，自二月开始一再检查线路，并报告上级，复于宣化解放初向宣市政府负责人建议收集民间散存电表等物，尚属重视职守。此次高压线损失，原因颇多，且线路漫长，非该公司本身力量所能及，故免予议处。
    八、察哈尔省人民政府，对护矿问题始则未加注意，至发现矿场遭受严重破坏事件后，仅发布一般的禁止破坏的指示和命令，未及时进行实地检查与有效制止破坏的措施，致该矿仍继续遭受破坏。为纠正此种官僚主义作风，应予该省府主席张苏以批评处分。
    九、龙关三区古城子村干部及五区汤池口农会主任李满堂等自动武装护矿，抓获人犯，截回资财，应由县府分别查明记功，并制发奖状，以示表扬。
