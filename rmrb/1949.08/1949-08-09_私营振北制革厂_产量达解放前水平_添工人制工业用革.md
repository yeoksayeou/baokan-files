    Private Zhenbei Tannery

    Production Reaches Pre-Liberation Levels

    Adds Workers to Manufacture Industrial Leather

    [This newspaper report] After the private Zhenbei Tannery in Beiping participated in the Beiping Municipal Industrial Exhibition, the People's Government gave it special assistance. In mid-July, the Bank of Communications provided the factory with a real-value loan of 10 million yuan. The factory also recognized that labor-management benefit could only be achieved through developing production. After obtaining the loan, the entire amount was used to purchase cowhide. A meeting of staff and workers was convened to formulate a production plan based on the factory's regular pre-liberation production volume, aiming to produce ten cowhides per day. Workers' Union representatives Wang Zhiquan and Li Rong guaranteed that all staff and workers would complete the production plan. Currently, the factory's production volume has recovered to pre-liberation levels, producing 300 cowhides per month. Because the workers are highly motivated, although the plan called for ten cowhides per day, they sometimes exceed the plan, with a maximum daily production of fifteen cowhides. In view of the importance of industrial leather, the factory has also added a leather goods department to manufacture leather rings, mallets, belts, and other items. Ten workers have been added, and recently five apprentices have been recruited to expand production.

    私营振北制革厂
    产量达解放前水平
    添工人制工业用革
    【本报讯】北平私营振北制革厂在参加北平市工业展览会后，人民政府特予以扶助，于七月中旬由交通银行贷与该厂折实贷款一千万元，厂方也认识到要劳资两利，只有发展生产。贷得款项后即以全数购买牛皮，并召集职工座谈，按解放前经常生产量拟定一个生产计划，每日生产牛皮十张。职工会代表王志全、李荣保证全体职工完成生产计划。现该厂生产量已恢复到解放前生产水平，每月生产牛皮三百张。因为工人工作积极，虽然拟定每日生产牛皮十张，有时还超过计划，每日最高生产量到十五张牛皮。该厂因鉴于工业用革之重要，又增设革制部，制造皮圈、榔头、轮带等。增添了工人十人，最近又招收学徒五人，以扩大生产。
