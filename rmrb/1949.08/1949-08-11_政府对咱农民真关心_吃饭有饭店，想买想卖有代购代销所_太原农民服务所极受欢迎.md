    [Taiyuan News] The farmer restaurant and farmer purchasing and sales center, sponsored by the Taiyuan Farmer Service Center, officially opened on August 1st. Both places are based on the spirit of serving farmers, giving farmers great preferential treatment and convenience in terms of price and other aspects. The various meals sold at the farmer restaurant are lower than the market price. For example, a bowl of soup noodles sells for 50 yuan on the market, while at the farmer restaurant, a bowl of soup noodles only sells for 40 yuan. Moreover, they are also responsible for introducing accommodation and introducing farmers to the purchasing and sales center to buy and sell goods. The farmer purchasing and sales center now has earth cloth, foreign cloth, matches, cigarettes and other commodities for farmers to buy, and is responsible for purchasing other commodities on their behalf, and is responsible for consignment sales for those selling goods. Both places have been well received by farmers since their opening. More than 30 farmers from Kelan, Baode, Qingyuan and other places, who had bought goods and were about to return, personally visited the stores and offices after hearing the news of the establishment of the farmer service center. They said happily: "The government really cares about us farmers. There is a place to eat, a place to stay, large shops for horses and carts with livestock, and purchasing and sales centers for buying and selling. We will go back and publicize it, and tell the farmers to come and stay in our own shops in the future." Farmers from Wutai, Qinyuan and other places also asked the farmer service center to issue them slips so they could find them next time they came.
