    Beginning with a Good Start and Finishing Well, Significant Progress Achieved
    Study of Chairman Mao's July 1st Thesis Concluded
    Cadres of the Twelfth District Move into New Studies
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The cadres of the Twelfth District have concluded their study of "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" on the 6th of this month. This study went through processes such as individual reading, mutual aid group discussions, raising questions, large group discussions, and large-scale debates. During the large group discussions, the study committee issued daily bulletins (wall newspapers) to report on the discussion in each group and introduce the most intensely debated issues. Many comrades voluntarily raised questions on the wall newspaper to "challenge" and initiate debates. In the three days of large-scale discussions, fierce debates were conducted on several fundamental issues. On the 5th, a test was held, with those scoring 90 points or higher accounting for a little over 40 percent of the test takers, and those failing only accounting for 3 percent, which is a great improvement compared to the initial test in early June, when those failing accounted for 36 percent.
    On the 6th, a review was conducted. During the review, everyone said that after this study, many confused concepts had been clarified. They also put forward many valuable opinions and serious criticisms regarding the study leadership. First of all, the study plan, although more complete than in the past, was still not appropriate enough. For example, sometimes the reading time was a bit short, relatively lengthening the time for mutual aid group discussions, mechanically stipulating dates, causing individual groups to wait and go through the motions after discussing the issues; the comrades responsible for the study did not provide enough concrete assistance to each group's study. More attention should be paid to these aspects in the future. Everyone felt that, generally speaking, this study was the high point of learning since entering the city, it was grasped relatively tightly, planned in detail in advance, and closely followed by review and summary afterwards, which can be said to have a good beginning and a good end, and should be further developed in the future.
    The reason why this study was able to achieve this level of success is mainly the result of the strengthening of the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee and the further emphasis on study and "hands-on" work by the responsible comrades of the district. Making a detailed and specific study plan through everyone in advance, so as not to fall into laissez-faire or be disrupted in the process, is also an important factor.

### 有始有终进步显著  学习毛主席七一论文结束  十二区干部转入新的学习

    有始有终进步显著
    学习毛主席七一论文结束
    十二区干部转入新的学习
    【本报讯】十二区干部“论人民民主专政”的学习，已于本月六日结束。这次学习经过了个人阅读、互助小组漫谈、提问题，大组讨论、大会论战等过程。在大组讨论时，学委会每日出快报（墙报），报导各组讨论情况，介绍争论最热烈的问题。有好些同志，自动在墙报上提出问题“点将”，展开争论。在三天的大会讨论中，对若干基本问题都作了激烈的辩论。五号举行了测验，九十分以上的占参加测验人数的百分之四十强，不及格的只占百分之三，比六月初测验时，不及格的占百分之三十六，是进步多了。
    六号举行了检讨。在检讨中，大家都说经过这次学习，把好多糊涂观念弄清了。并对学习领导提出很多宝贵的意见和严正的批评。首先是学习计划，虽较以往完善，但还不够适宜。如有时阅读时间有些短，相对地拖长了互助小组漫谈的时间，机械地规定日期，使个别小组在问题讨论完之后等待敷衍；负责学习的同志具体地帮助各小组学习作的还不够。今后应在这几方面多加注意。大家觉得，总的说来这次学习是入城以来学习的最高潮，抓的比较紧，事先详细计划，事后紧接着检讨总结，可以称得起有头有尾，今后应加以发挥。
    这次学习所以能够得到这一点成绩，主要是市委的领导加强与区的各负责同志进一步重视学习与“亲自动手”的结果。事先通过大家作出具体详细的学习计划，在进行中不致陷于自流或乱了步骤，也是一个重要的因素。（十二区区委会通讯组）
