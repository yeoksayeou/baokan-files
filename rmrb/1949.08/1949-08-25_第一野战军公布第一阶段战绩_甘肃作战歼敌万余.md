Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, August 24th: The Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) First Field Army has released a combat communique regarding the first phase of its advance into Gansu. The communique states that since July 24th, various units of the PLA First Field Army launched a powerful offensive into Gansu province. By August 11th, in 19 days of combat, a total of 11,900+ troops of the Qinghai and Ningxia "Two Ma" bandit armies and local Gansu bandit forces were annihilated. Twenty-three county towns were recovered and liberated, namely: @ County, Long County, Changwu in Shaanxi Province; Pingliang, Tianshui, Lingtai, Jingchuan, Chongxin, Zhenyuan, Ning County, Zhengning, Guyuan, Haiyuan, Longde, Huaping, Huating, Jingning, Zhuanglang, Qin'an, Qingshui, Tongwei, Gangu, and Wushan in Gansu Province.

Under the PLA's powerful offensive, the "Two Ma" bandit armies of Qinghai and Ningxia did not dare to resist and fled separately. Before fleeing, they burned grain and supplies and extensively damaged roads, bridges, and power lines. Many enemy puppet armed forces revolted or surrendered. In addition to the puppet self-defense forces of Jingchuan, Chongxin, Lingtai, Huaping, Zhuanglang, Qingshui, and Wushan counties revolting or surrendering, the Kuomintang regular army units that revolted included Wang Ziqi's 247th Division Cavalry Regiment, one battalion of the 245th Division, and one battalion of the Supplementary 3rd Regiment of the Gansu Puppet Garrison District. Due to the PLA's conscientious implementation of ethnic minority policies and lenient treatment of prisoners of war, particularly the repatriation of Ma bandit army prisoners of war, the PLA has gained a good reputation among the vast Hui population and within the Ma bandit army. Hui and Han people along the way warmly welcome the PLA, and large-scale desertions have occurred in the Ma bandit army. These factors have created favorable conditions for the PLA's smooth advance.

The communique announced the preliminary results of the 19-day campaign: a total of 2,539 enemies were killed or wounded; 5,898 enemies were captured, including Ma Zhengkui, Deputy Commander of the Qing Ma 248th Division, and Yang Xingke, a Major General staff member of the bandit "Ministry of National Defense," and others; 2,110 soldiers from Wang Ziqi's 247th Division Cavalry Regiment under Regiment Commander Zhao Yuting revolted; 1,356 surrendered. The total number of enemies eliminated was 11,903. The following were seized: 2 anti-tank guns, 22 82mm mortars, 41 60mm mortars, 46 heavy machine guns, 181 light machine guns, 3,948 rifles and carbines, 37 submachine guns, 3,930 rounds of various artillery shells, 789,390+ rounds of various bullets, 6 radio stations, 16 telephones, 3 automobiles, 11,500 gallons of gasoline, 2 locomotives, 50+ train cars, 1,510 mules and horses, 67,630 *shi* of grain, 500,000 *jin* of salt, 8,000+ sets of cotton-padded clothing, and many other supplies.
