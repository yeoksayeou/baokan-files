Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 20th: TASS, The Hague, August 17th: According to Dutch newspaper reports, Western European nations participating in the Marshall Plan are quarreling over the allocation of dollar funds for the second phase of the Marshall Plan. A correspondent for the newspaper "Trouw" in Paris reports that consultations held in Paris last week by Marshall Plan nations revealed very divergent opinions among these countries, with little hope of reaching any agreement. The dispute particularly involves representatives from Britain and the Netherlands. The British delegation demanded that the majority of dollar funds allocated to Marshall Plan countries should be given to Britain, as the British economy is said to be in danger of collapse. However, representatives from the Netherlands, Italy, and other countries firmly opposed the British proposal. The British side also protested against the demands put forward by the Netherlands. It is said that the prospects for reaching an agreement on the distribution of loans among Marshall Plan countries are extremely bleak. It is expected that British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps will directly negotiate with the US government in Washington in early September regarding Britain's acquisition of a large allocation.

　　西欧马计国家争夺美元拨款
    【新华社北平二十日电】塔斯社海牙十七日讯：据荷兰报纸消息：西欧马歇尔计划国家，对于第二期马歇尔计划美元拨款的分配问题正在争吵中。特拉乌报驻巴黎记者报道：马歇尔计划国家上周在巴黎所举行的协商，显示这些国家之间的意见非常分歧，没有希望达到任何协议。争执特别牵连英国与荷兰的代表。英国代表团要求，给予马计国家的美元款项，应大部分拨归英国，因为据说英国经济有崩溃的危险。但是，荷兰、意大利及其他国家的代表，坚决反对英国的建议。英国方面亦抗议荷兰所提出的要求。据称马计国家之间就贷款的分派获得协议的前途极为黯淡。预计英外相贝文与财相克利浦斯将于九月初在华盛顿与美国政府直接商洽英国获得大量分配额的问题。
