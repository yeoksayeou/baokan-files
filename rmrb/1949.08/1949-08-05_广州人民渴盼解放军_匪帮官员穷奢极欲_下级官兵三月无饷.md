Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 4th: According to people from Guangzhou, the city under the control of the remaining Kuomintang bandit gang is now in chaos. Bandit gang officials are busy fleeing to Taiwan and Chongqing, while simultaneously indulging in extravagance and shameless debauchery. Since the bandit government agencies moved in, dance halls, brothels, Western suit shops, and high-end restaurants in Guangzhou have increased significantly; gambling dens are completely open, with over forty large casinos alone. The lives of ordinary people are full of suffering. Lower-level civil servants and lower-ranking Kuomintang soldiers have not received any salary for three months, forcing an estimated 30,000 or more to make a living as petty traders. Students from various places who were lured to Guangzhou by the Kuomintang bandit gang are in a miserable state, lacking clothing and food. Recently, a group of female refugee students publicly advertised in the newspaper, collectively seeking marriage. Many male students are being forcibly conscripted into the army by the Kuomintang bandit gang. Prices in Guangzhou are skyrocketing. Within the first ten days of the "silver dollar certificate" being issued, prices increased fivefold, and few people are willing to use the silver dollar certificate. Currently, the broad masses of people in Guangzhou are eagerly awaiting the People's Liberation Army to quickly liberate Guangzhou, so that they can be freed from the dark rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang as soon as possible.

    广州人民渴盼解放军
    匪帮官员穷奢极欲
    下级官兵三月无饷
    【新华社上海四日电】据广州来人谈：国民党残余匪帮盘踞下的广州现在是一片混乱。匪帮官员一面忙着向台湾和重庆逃跑，一面穷奢极欲，荒淫无耻。穗市舞厅、妓院、西装店、大菜馆等，自匪政府机关迁往后，已大量增加；赌场已完全公开，仅大赌场即有四十余家之多。一般人民生活则痛苦不堪。下级公务员及国民党军下级官兵已三个月没得到一点薪金，因而被迫靠跑单帮糊口的据估计约在三万人以上。被国民党匪帮诱骗至广州的各地流亡学生陷于无衣无食悲惨状态。最近有一批流亡女学生公开登报，集体征婚。许多男学生则被国民党匪帮强迫当兵。穗市物价正直线飞涨。“银元券”发行后的最初十日内物价即上涨五倍，很少有人愿意使用银元券。现穗市广大人民切盼人民解放军赶快打到广州去，使他们早日从国民党匪帮黑暗统治下解放出来。
