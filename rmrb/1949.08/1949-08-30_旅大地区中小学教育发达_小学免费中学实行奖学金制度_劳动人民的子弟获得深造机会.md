Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, August 27th: School education in the Lüda area is becoming increasingly developed. The region now has eight middle schools (excluding higher and junior normal schools), with 6,049 students, nearly double the number during the Japanese occupation. Among them, 49.3% are children of the working people. There are 527 primary schools with 147,510 students, more than half of whom are children of workers and peasants. In Dalian City, which had only twelve primary schools under Japanese rule, the number has increased to twenty-nine this year. The school enrollment rate for children has also significantly increased. During the Japanese occupation, only 18.2% of school-age children in the city were enrolled, rising to 61.4% in 1948. By this year, most of the poor children in the city have been enrolled. In Lüshun City, during the Japanese occupation, surveys showed there were no fewer than 20,000 school-age children, but only 7,840 were enrolled, mostly children from wealthy families, with most poor children unable to attend school. Currently, 28,548 children in the city are receiving democratic education, with only 678 children in the entire city out of school. In the urban area, only ten out of 3,438 school-age children are unable to attend school due to disabilities or illness. To popularize national education, the government has implemented free primary education throughout the region, and textbooks are provided free of charge to poor children. In Dalian City, about one-third of poor children receive this benefit. For secondary schools, the Lüda Administrative Office has implemented a system of government-funded students and scholarships. 1,489 middle school students in the city have received scholarship support, thus a large number of children of the working people have gained opportunities for advanced studies.

　　旅大地区中小学教育发达
    小学免费中学实行奖学金制度
  　劳动人民的子弟获得深造机会
    【新华社大连二十七日电】旅大地区学校教育日趋发达。全区现有中学八处（不包括高、初级师范），学生六千零四十九名，较日寇时代增加了几近一倍。其中百分之四十九点三为劳动人民子弟。小学有五百二十七处，学生数达十四万七千五百零十名，其中工农子弟占二分之一以上。大连市在日寇统治时，仅有小学十二处，今年已增加到二十九处。儿童的就学率也显著提高，全市学龄童的就学数目，在日寇统治时代仅占百分之十八点二，一九四八年增至六十一点四，及至今年全市贫苦儿童均已大部入学。旅顺市在日寇统治时期，据调查共有学龄儿童不下两万人，但就学的仅有七千八百四十名，多是富家子弟，大部贫苦子弟无法入学。现在该市受民主教育的儿童已有二万八千五百四十八名，全市失学儿童仅六百七十八名。在市区中三千四百三十八名学龄儿童中，仅十名因残废和有病未能入学。政府为了普及国民教育，全区小学实行一律免费，对贫苦子弟并免费发给教科书，大连市贫苦儿童受到此种待遇的约占三分之一。对于中等学校，旅大行政公署实行了公费生及奖学金制度，全市中学生有一千四百八十九名享受了奖学金的待遇，大批劳动人民子弟因而获得深造机会。
