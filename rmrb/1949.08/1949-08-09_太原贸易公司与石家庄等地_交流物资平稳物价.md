    Taiyuan Trading Company Exchanges Goods with Shijiazhuang and Other Places to Stabilize Prices
    [Taiyuan News] The Taiyuan City Trading Company is exchanging goods with Shijiazhuang, Taiyue and other places. In early July, in order to regulate the supply of goods and stabilize prices, the company signed a cotton-for-cloth contract with the Shijiazhuang Trading Company. The contract stipulated that the Taiyuan City Trading Company would exchange 552,933 jin of raw cotton for 20,000 bolts of white cloth from the Shijiazhuang Trading Company (including Shanlu cloth, Xingqiu cloth, Fengyi cloth, Fu Shanlu cloth, and He Pi cloth, etc.). Cotton immediately began to be shipped to Shijiazhuang, and a large quantity of cloth was also transported to Taiyuan city. At the same time, the Taiyuan City Trading Company also carried out material exchanges with a branch of the Taiyue Trading Company, exchanging industrial products from Taiyuan for agricultural products from Taiyue. After negotiation between the two parties, the Taiyuan City Company exchanged 834 bolts of Mingyue cloth, 976 bolts of Jinding cloth, 600 boxes of matches, plus 5,871,000 yuan in RMB, for 545,000 jin of wheat, 100,000 jin of millet, 220,000 jin of corn, and 93,000 jin of beans from the Taiyue Trading Company's branch. In addition, in order to ensure the grain supply of Taiyuan City, the City Company recently purchased 1,000,000 jin of wheat in Shijiazhuang. The above-mentioned exchange of grain and cloth will play a certain role in stabilizing prices in the future.
