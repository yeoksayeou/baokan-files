    Yugoslav Trotskyites are the Shock Troops of Imperialism
    Rakosi, General Secretary of the Hungarian Workers' Party
    (Continued from yesterday)
    Naturally, this development process cannot but affect the internal situation of the country. All capitalist elements, from speculators in the cities to wealthy peasants in the countryside, can now breathe more freely. In implementing their policy aimed at opposing the industrial proletariat loyal to communism and the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav Trotskyites are increasingly dependent on capitalist elements. The result of Tito's anti-worker and anti-people policy is the growth of speculation and the smuggling of industrial goods and grain into the black market from the social supply system. Last spring, when several members of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Working People's Party went to Yugoslavia to understand the situation, they were surprised to see that the living standards of the workers there had been reduced to an unprecedented level: reactionary groups' secret propaganda explained that this was because a lot of grain had been transported to the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. Since then, these despicable slanders have become the "daily fare" of Tito's official propaganda.
    After the break with the People's Democracies, the rationing situation for Yugoslav workers deteriorated sharply. The wealthy peasant class and speculators wielded greater power, and there was less and less grain and industrial goods. The scarcity of goods was further exacerbated because most of the commodities were supplied to the police, local officials, senior officers, and other privileged individuals.
    In letters sent from Yugoslavia, workers complained bitterly that while children could not see milk, every officer, if married, could receive five liters of milk per day, and if unmarried, could receive three liters. Workers could not see meat for years, while privileged figures could receive unlimited meat, fat, and cream in special stores. The indignation caused by this was so great that officers' wives and workers' wives often cursed each other in front of the stores, and later, the stores had to bring out the goods secretly.
    The working people are becoming increasingly impoverished, while the upper classes can buy milk and cream and have become the best suppliers for speculators. An article describing a party held by Tito was published in the Swiss newspaper "Tages-Anzeiger," which showed how corrupt and degenerate the Titoists have become. A reporter named Bavel, who was invited to attend this party held in the former religious palace, wrote: "In a hall, there were three hundred officers, all covered in gold and silver embroidery and medals. Beautiful ladies in gorgeous evening dresses accompanied them. The men were wearing snow-white tailcoats with gold embellishments. All of this looked very much like a mysterious scene from Hollywood. The steam from gold and silver dishes enveloped every banquet table. Eighty kinds of dishes were served. Among the sumptuous dishes were Tokay, Bordeaux, Frascati - (all wine names - editor) and of course, champagne."
    Comrades who have escaped from Yugoslavia say that ever since wealthy peasants were given priority in being admitted to the Communist Party, one could often see wealthy peasant Communist Party members, or former guerrillas, or hired peasant Communist Party members who served as servants for wealthy peasants, serving the Southern traitors of the Nedić and Pavelić ilk. However, this does not prevent Tito and his gang from clamoring: "We have laid the foundation, and now we can directly embark on socialist construction."
    The Yugoslav Trotskyites responded to the workers' protests with terror and arrests. Hungry and dissatisfied workers did not cherish machines and lathes. Many substandard products were made, and the Trotskyites said that the machines and materials sent by the People's Democracies were all bad. However, this did not help, and the discontent of the working people continued to grow.
    Tito and his gang wanted to use the dissatisfaction of the Yugoslav working masses against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, thereby diverting the attention of the working people from the real causes of their poverty. In addition, since the break with the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav betrayers have begun a frenzied national abuse. Everything stale and Great Serbian chauvinistic is being quoted from the archives. Brutal nationalist propaganda is being carried out against the people of Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, and other neighboring countries. Serbian Prime Minister and Communist Party General Secretary Stambolić directly stated in his report to the Serbian Parliament that the Hungarian Republic was plotting to invade Bačka again, Romania was plotting to occupy Banat, Bulgaria was plotting to occupy Macedonia, and Albania was attempting to occupy Metohija. Tito also sang the high tune of this nationalist propaganda. On May 15, he gave a despicable speech full of this kind of provocation at the party conference of the Guards, for example, he said: "Yugoslavia extended a hand of peace to Hungary after all their malicious attacks. Today, they are completing the attacks on Yugoslavia in the most despicable way," and so on. Nationalist Tito's forte - but the crimes of Horthy are being inflicted on the People's Democracies.
    Titoists not only preach chauvinism to the people of neighboring countries. Among Tito's henchmen, there has long been an internal agreement that Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes should hold the top positions in Yugoslavia. Since Tito's betrayal, the oppression of minority nationalities has been particularly intensified. Local workers in Chernogoria, Bosnia, and Vojvodina are being expelled as "unreliable elements," but in these positions, Great Serbian chauvinists are being replaced first. However, the union of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes falls apart when touched, because chauvinism is also spreading in Croatia and Slovenia. People who have escaped from Yugoslavia say that Great Serbian chauvinism, as in the Kingdom period, is again oppressing the backward nationalities in the country.
    Therefore, officials of the old regime who were instructing behind the scenes have reappeared. Former Prime Minister of the Kingdom government Trifunović, the notorious prosecutor Marković, former police officer Toso, the leaders of the disbanded "Eagle Regiment" and other nationalist organizations have all returned to the stage.

    南斯拉夫的托洛茨基分子是帝国主义的突击队
    匈工人党中央委员会总书记  拉科西
    （续昨）
    自然，这种发展过程，不能不影响到国家内部的情况，一切资本主义成份，从城市的投机商人一直到乡村的富农，现在可以更自由地呼吸了。南斯拉夫的托洛茨基分子在实行其旨在反对忠实于共产主义和苏联的工业无产阶级的政策中，越发依赖着资本主义的成份了，铁托这种反工人和反人民的政策的结果——便是投机的增长，社会供给制度中工业品和粮食向黑市走私。去年春天，匈牙利劳动人民党政治局若干委员去南斯拉夫了解情况时，他们惊奇地看到，在那里劳动者生活水平空前减低：反动集团的秘密宣传解释说，这是因为很多粮食都运到苏联和人民民主国家去了。从那时起，这些卑鄙的非难就成了铁托分子官方宣传的“家常便饭”。
    在与人民民主国家破裂之后，南斯拉夫劳动者的配给情形即急剧恶化。富农阶级和投机分子握有更大势力，粮食和工业品越来越少。还因为商品大部分都供给警察、土官将校、高级职员等，而使商品更加缺乏。
    自南斯拉夫寄来的信中，劳动者诉苦般地说道，在小孩子看不到牛奶的当儿，每个军官，如他已婚，每天可领五公升牛奶，如未结婚，可领三公升。工人们成年累月见不到肉，而特权人物在特别商店里可以无限制地领到肉，脂肪和奶油。由此而引起的愤慨是如是之大，军官妻子与工人的老婆经常在商店前面互相呕骂，而在后来，商店不得不从暗中把货物弄出来。
    劳动人民日益贫穷，而上层阶级则能买到牛奶和奶油，并且成了投机分子的最好的供给者。在瑞士“丈·温得·吉”报上载有一篇描写铁托举行一个晚会的文章，在这篇文章里表明了铁托分子已是何等的腐化堕落。一位被邀请参加这次在前宗教宫中举行的晚会的记者巴夫尔写道：“在一间大厅中有三百位军官，他们满身都佩以金银的刺绣和勋章。艳丽夜装的漂亮女郎陪伴在他们身旁。使人身上穿着带有金饰的雪白的燕尾服。所有这一切都酷似好莱坞的神秘情景。金银色的大菜的蒸气，笼罩着每一个宴席。上了八十种菜。在丰盛的菜肴中有托卡伊、鲍尔多、佛拉斯卡梯——（均酒名——编者）当然也有香槟酒。”
    由南斯拉夫逃出来的同志们说，自从富农被吸收加入共产党有优先权时起，就可以经常看到为富农共产党员，或以前的游击队员，或给富农当奴仆使用的，为纳去奇、巴维利奇之流的南奸服务的雇农共产党员。但是，这并不妨碍铁托及其党徒大声喧嚷：“我们已奠立了基础，现在我们可以直接着手社会主义建设”。
    南斯拉夫的托洛茨基分子用恐怖和逮捕回答了工人们的抗议。饥饿的和不满意的工人不爱惜机器和车床。做了许多非成品，而托洛茨基分子们却说，人民民主国家送来的都是坏机器和材料，但是，这样于事并无裨益，而劳动人民的不满却日益增长。
    铁托及其党徒想利用南斯拉夫劳动大众不满的情绪来反对苏联和人民民主国家，从而把劳动人民的注意目标，从他们贫困的真实原因上移开。此外，自从与苏联破裂以来，南斯拉夫出卖者便开始了疯狂的民族虐待。从文库中引用着一切陈腐的大塞尔维沙文主义的特质。对匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚以及其他邻国各族人民都进行着野蛮的民族主义宣传。塞尔维亚总理和共产党总书记斯达姆波利奇在其对塞尔维亚国会所做的报告中曾直接了当地说，匈牙利共和国又图侵占巴契卡，罗马尼亚图占巴纳特，保加利亚图占马其顿，而阿尔巴尼亚则企图占领麦托西亚。铁托也大唱其这种民族主义宣传的高调。五月十五日，他在警卫军的党会议上就曾发出卑鄙的，充满着这种挑拨的演说，比如，他说：“南斯拉夫在匈牙利人们一切恶意攻击之后，曾向他们伸出和平之手。他们今天最卑劣地完成着对南斯拉夫的攻击”等等。民族主义者铁托的拿手好戏——但是把霍尔特的罪恶加诸在人民民主国家的身上。
    铁托分子不仅对各邻国人民鼓吹沙文主义。在铁托党徒那里早就存在着在南斯拉夫头等地位应属于塞尔维、霍尔瓦特和斯洛文人的内部协定。自铁托叛变时起，对少数民族的压迫就特别加强起来了。在彻尔诺哥利亚、波斯尼亚、沃耶沃廷的地方工作人员作为“不可靠分子”而横加驱逐，可是在这些位置上，首先代之以大塞尔维沙文主义者。然而，塞尔维、霍尔瓦特、斯洛文联合是一扯就破的。因为在霍尔瓦特和斯洛文尼亚也在散布着沙文主义。自南斯拉夫逃出来的人说，大塞尔维沙文主义一如王国时期，它又在压迫着国内落后的民族。
    因之，曾在幕后指示的旧政体官员又出现了。前任王国政府内阁总理特里弗诺维奇、臭名远扬的检事马尔柯维奇、前任警察官托邵、被解散的“鹰团”以及其他民族组织的领导者都纷纷再次粉墨登场。
