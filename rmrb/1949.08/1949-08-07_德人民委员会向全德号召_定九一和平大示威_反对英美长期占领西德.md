Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: TASS, Berlin: The German People's Council recently announced September 1st (the outbreak of the Second World War) as Germany's Peace Day. Now, at the suggestion of the Presidium of the German People's Council and the German Committee for the Defense of Peace, it held a special meeting on August 4th with the participation of prominent figures from all walks of life to actively prepare for the Peace Day movement. The meeting adopted a letter to the German people for Peace Day, calling on the German people to unanimously hold large-scale peace demonstrations throughout Germany on September 1st. The letter to the German people reviewed the losses caused by the two world wars, emphasizing that the forces of war have not been completely suppressed, and peace is not yet solid. Under the leadership of American imperialists, military pacts are being re-established. The threat of being used to serve the American war machine looms over West Germany. In order to turn West Germany into a colony of the American ruling class and a docile tool for its aggressive policies, imperialism is trying to prevent Germany from restoring its unity and concluding a peace treaty. For the same purpose, Germany has been deprived of its independence, and the occupation by Western countries has become long-term. The letter to the German people continued: However, the despicable plans of the enemies of peace cannot and will not succeed. The growing danger of war must be opposed by the firm will of the people to defend peace. The German people, who bear more responsibility for the previous two world wars than any other country's people, must unanimously express on September 1st that they have embarked on a new path, a path of peace and international understanding, and demonstrate the determination of the German people to follow this path. The letter to the German people finally called on the German people to fight for the friendship of all countries and actively cooperate with the largest international organizations serving peace.

    德人民委员会向全德号召
    定九一和平大示威
    反对英美长期占领西德
    【新华社北平六日电】塔斯社柏林讯：德国人民委员会不久以前宣布了九月一日（二次大战爆发）为德国和平日，现该委员会应德国人民委员会主席团和德国拥护和平委员会的提议，于八月四日举行有各界名流参加的特别会议，积极准备和平日运动。会议通过了为和平日告德国人民书，号召德国人民于九月一日在全德各地一致举行和平大示威。告德国人民书回溯了两次世界大战中所造成的损失，着重指出战争的势力还没有被完全镇压住，和平还不够巩固。在美国帝国主义者领导之下，军事公约重又缔结。可能被利用为美国战争机器服务的威胁笼罩着西德。帝国主义为了要把西德变成美国统治阶级的殖民地和侵略政策的驯服工具，正力图使德国不能恢复统一和缔结和约。为了同样的目的，德国被剥夺了独立，而西方国家的占领则变成长期化。告德国人民书继称：但是，和平敌人的卑劣计划，是不能也不会成功的。增长着的战争危险，必须以人民拥护和平的坚决意志予以反对。对于上两次世界大战要比任何其他国家人民都要负更多责任的德国人民，必须在九月一日一致地表示，他们已走上了新的道路，走上了和平和国际互谅的道路，并表明德国人民遵循这一道路的决心。告德国人民书最后号召德国人民为一切国家的友谊而斗争，与为和平服务的各最大国际组织积极合作。
