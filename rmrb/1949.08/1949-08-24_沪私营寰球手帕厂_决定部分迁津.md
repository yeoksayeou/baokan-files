Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station, August 23rd broadcast: The private Huanqiu Handkerchief Factory in Shanghai, in response to the government's call to overcome production difficulties, has decided to relocate part of its operations to Tianjin. Preparations for the relocation have already been completed. Earlier this month, the factory's General Manager, Yao Siwei, went to Tianjin to conduct an on-site investigation of local conditions. He returned to Shanghai on the 21st and said: Tianjin is very developed in both domestic and foreign trade. The North China Trade Administration stipulates that Shanghai factories relocating to various areas, if they hold a business license for import and export merchants from the East China Foreign Trade Administration and have a letter of introduction from the bureau, can engage in import and export business in North China, so there is no problem with domestic and foreign sales channels. If all goes well, the move may be completed within the month. There are sixty to seventy employees preparing to go north, mostly female workers. They generally have beautiful hopes for Tianjin. Han Jinyun, a female worker who weaves plain cloth, has a child. She said: As long as someone takes care of the child, I am very willing to go to Tianjin. In these difficult times, capitalists should find ways to relocate the factory and find a way out, and we workers will naturally support it.

　　沪私营寰球手帕厂
  　决定部分迁津
    【上海人民广播电台二十三日广播】私营寰球手帕厂，为响应政府号召，克服生产困难，决定部分北迁天津。且已完成迁厂准备工作。本月初该厂总经理姚思伟前往天津实地考察当地情况，二十一日返沪，他说：天津对内外贸易都很发达，华北区贸易管理局对上海迁往各厂，如领有华东区国外贸易管理局进出口商营业执照及备有该局介绍信者，就可到华北区经营进出口业务，所以内外销路都不成问题。如进行顺利，月内可能成行。预备北上的职工有六七十人，大都是女工，她们对天津一般怀有美丽的憧憬，素机女工韩锦云有一孩子，她说：只要孩子有人照顾，我很愿意到天津去，在目前困难的时候，资本家应设法迁厂，找到出路，我们工人自然是支持的。
