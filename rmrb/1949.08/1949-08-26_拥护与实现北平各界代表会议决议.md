　　Upholding and Implementing the Resolutions of the Beiping All-Circles Representative Conference
　　Summary of Comrade Xu Liqun's Radio Address
　　Xu Liqun, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League in Beiping, gave a speech on Beiping People's Broadcasting Station on the 24th, titled "Upholding and Implementing the Resolutions of the Beiping All-Circles Representative Conference." Excerpts are as follows:
　　Young friends of Beiping, Comrades of the New Democratic Youth League in Beiping!
　　The Beiping All-Circles Representative Conference has concluded eight days ago. This conference is the first time since the liberation of Beiping that so many representatives from all circles have gathered to review and study how to build a people's Beiping.
　　The conference fully promoted democracy and responsibly passed many important resolutions.
　　We support all the resolutions of this representative conference. Moreover, we must mobilize the youth, the Youth League members, and the people from all walks of life to work together, and give full play to the vanguard role and leading role of the youth in our work, to help the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Beiping Municipal People's Government implement these resolutions! The main things we young people need to do are as follows:
　　First, in continuing to eliminate the remaining bandits and special agents, and further consolidate the revolutionary order, in the past, many factories organized factory security teams, and many Youth League members became active participants in these security teams, playing a significant role in protecting factories and preventing sabotage. In the future, we must be more active and vigilant. In schools, in assisting the government in registering reactionary party and league members and preventing special agents and bandits from undermining the revolutionary order, we must work harder and not allow any reactionary bandits to continue their conspiracies of sabotage.
　　Secondly, in terms of restoring and developing production, Youth League members in factories must play the leading role and shock force role of young people. In the past, many Youth League members have played a significant exemplary role in factory production. However, some Youth League members in factories have not closely integrated their work focus with the task of restoring and developing production. After this All-Circles Representative Conference, we should unite the broad masses of young workers and adult workers to do our best to restore and develop production. And we should move forward in learning technology and learning culture.
　　Thirdly, in terms of improving and popularizing cultural education, Youth League members in schools should unite the broad masses of students, and under the leadership of the education administration and progressive school authorities, provide opinions on improving the curriculum and academic system, strengthen the learning method of combining theory with practice, promote the spirit of unity and mutual assistance between teachers and students, and work together to implement the new democratic education policy. As for the tuition fees of private middle schools, the resolution of the All-Circles Representative Conference is that the school authorities and student representatives should negotiate together, and if there are disputes, the education bureau will lead the resolution. This method is a pragmatic solution that takes care of all parties. Youth League members should carry out publicity and explanation among school authorities, students, and parents, so that the tuition fee problem can be properly resolved, both ensuring that private schools are not unable to continue operating due to financial difficulties, and allowing economically disadvantaged students to have as many opportunities to attend school as possible. As for carrying out adult cultural literacy education, during the summer vacation, the Youth League and the Beiping Student Union have jointly mobilized more than 300 young students to factories to help carry out cultural education work, assisting in the education of nearly 10,000 workers in more than 30 public factories and 45 workers' night schools; there are also many literacy classes and night schools organized by the Youth League student associations of major universities and middle schools. Regarding the resolution of the representative conference to carry out adult cultural literacy education, we are willing to mobilize Youth League members to work hard to promote it under the joint promotion of the education authorities, the Middle School Teachers' Union, and the Beiping Student Union.
　　Fourthly, in terms of streamlining and thrift, Comrade Zhou Enlai called on young people at this conference to play an exemplary role in this area. In factories, we must save machine raw materials and power, revive discarded machines; in schools and institutions, we must save water and electricity, and oppose extravagance and waste, because saving not only reduces the burden on the people, but also provides favorable conditions for the industrialization of our country.
　　Finally, we should also fulfill our responsibility to introduce and help solve the difficulties of dispersing unemployed intellectuals to the interior and to the countryside.
　　Our Beiping Youth League members, as the summer vacation is coming to an end, already number 10,000. However, to complete the tasks that should be done in building a new Beiping, this strength is still far from enough. Therefore, we should further unite and organize the broad masses of advanced working youth and intellectual youth into the ranks of the Youth League. We must oppose any arrogance, complacency, tendencies to be divorced from the masses, and closed-doorism, so that the Youth League becomes a truly broad mass organization of advanced young people. In addition, we must strive for assistance in all aspects in various tasks. For example, in factories, Youth League members cannot do a good job without the leadership of the Communist Party branch and without the help and cooperation of progressive factory directors, managers, engineers, and adult workers. In schools, Youth League members cannot do a good job without the leadership of the Communist Party branch and without the assistance of progressive principals, professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, teachers, and the broad masses of students. The same is true in other aspects. In the past, we have not done enough in striving for the assistance and cooperation of all parties. In the future, we hope that all parties will provide more help to this youth organization, help its work, help its development, and help it point out and correct its shortcomings when it has them. Only in this way can the Youth League play its due role.

　　拥护与实现北平各界代表会议决议
    许立群同志广播词摘要
    中国新民主主义青年团北平市筹委会主任许立群，二十四日在北平人民广播电台演讲，题目是“拥护与实现北平各界代表会议决议”，摘录如下：
    北平全市的青年朋友们，北平全市的新民主主义青年团的团员同志们！
    北平市各界代表会议，已经在八天前闭幕了。这次会议是北平解放以来第一次集中这么多的各界代表、来检讨与研究怎样建设人民的北平。
    会议充分发扬了民主，也十分负责地通过了许多重要的决议。
    我们拥护这次代表会议所有的决议。而且要动员青年们、青年团员们和各界人民在一起，并在工作中发挥青年人的先锋作用，带头作用，帮助中国共产党北平市委会、北平市人民政府，贯彻实行这些决议！我们青年主要要做的事有以下几项。
    第一，在继续肃清残余匪特，进一步巩固革命秩序方面，过去许多工厂中组织了工厂保卫队，许多青年团员成为这个保卫队的积极参加者，在护厂防奸方面，起了不少作用。今后要更加积极，提高警惕。在学校里面，在协助政府进行反动党团分子登记，防止特务匪徒破坏革命秩序上，要更加努力，不让任何反动匪徒继续进行破坏的阴谋活动。
    其次，在恢复与发展生产方面，工厂中的青年团员，要起着青年人的带头作用与突击作用。过去不少青年团员在工厂生产中起了不少模范作用，但是，有些工厂中的青年团员还没有把工作中心和贯彻恢复发展生产的任务很紧密结合起来。在这次各界代表会议之后，应该团结广大的青年工人和成年工人，为恢复发展生产而尽最大力量。并且在学习技术、学习文化方面向前推进一步。
    第三，在提高与普及文化教育方面，学校中的青年团员应该团结广大同学，在教育行政和进步的学校当局领导下，对改进课程学制提供意见，加强理论与实际结合的学习方法，发扬师生间团结互助的精神，共同为贯彻新民主主义的教育方针而努力。至于私立中学的学费问题，各界代表会议的决议由学校当局与学生代表共同协商，如果有争执，由教育局领导解决。这个办法是照顾各方的、实事求是的解决办法。青年团员要在学校当局、同学以及学生家长之间进行宣传解释，使学费问题获得妥善解决，既使私立学校不因经费困难而无法办下去，也要使经济困难的同学尽量有更多的上学的机会。至于开展成年文化补习教育，在暑假中青年团和北平市学联已经共同动员了三百以上的青年学生到工厂中帮助进行文化教育工作，在三十多个公营工厂和四十五个工人夜校中，帮助了将近一万工人的教育工作；各大中学校青年团学生会举办的识字班夜校也很多。对于代表会议开展成年文化补习教育的决议，我们愿意动员团员在教育当局和中小教职员联合会和北平市学联共同推动下努力推行。
    第四，在精简节约方面，这次会议中，周恩来同志号召青年要在这一方面发挥模范作用。在工厂中要节省机器原料和动力，复活废机器，在学校机关中节约水电，反对奢侈浪费作风，因为节省不只减轻人民负担，而且是为我们国家的工业化提供有利的条件。
    最后，还有疏散失业知识分子到内地去、到农村去，我们也应尽到介绍与帮助解决困难的责任。
    我们北平市的青年团员，在暑假将结束的现在，已经有一万团员了，但是要完成在建设新北平当中应尽的任务，这个力量还是很不够的，因此，我们应进一步把广大的先进的劳动青年、知识青年团结与组织到青年团的队伍中来，我们要反对任何骄傲自大，脱离群众和关门主义的倾向，使青年团成为真正广泛的先进青年的群众组织。除此之外，还要在各种工作中，争取各方面的协助。例如，在工厂中，青年团员没有共产党支部的领导，没有进步的厂长、经理、工程师和成年工人的帮助和配合是做不好事情的；在学校中，青年团员没有共产党支部的领导，没有进步的校长、教授、讲师、助教、教员先生和广大同学的协助，也是做不好事情的；其它方面也是如此。过去我们在争取各方面的协助配合这一点上做得很不够，今后希望各方面多帮助这个青年人自己的团体，帮助他的工作帮助他的发展，有缺点的时候帮助他指出和改正。只有这样，青年团才能有它应有的作用。
