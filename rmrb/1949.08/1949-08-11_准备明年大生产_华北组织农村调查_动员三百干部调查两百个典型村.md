    Preparing for Next Year's Great Production
    North China Organizes Rural Surveys
    Mobilizing 300 Cadres to Investigate 200 Typical Villages
    [This newspaper dispatch] To accurately understand the situation and problems of agricultural production in North China, and to devise solutions for formulating agricultural production plans for next year and the future, the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government has specially organized over 300 cadres from various directly affiliated units, the Cooperative Bank, the agricultural colleges of Peking University and Tsinghua University, and various provincial, administrative region, special district, and county levels, to conduct typical surveys in various parts of North China. All preparatory work has been completed, and they will depart successively from August 10th to 15th. The survey method is to divide North China into several economic zones, select two or three representative counties in each economic zone, select three to five typical villages in each representative county (selecting villages with existing survey materials as much as possible), and conduct serious investigations of one-third of the representative households in each typical village, and hold village cadre or old farmer investigation meetings, and refer to historical materials to summarize the overall situation of the village. It is also planned to use these as base-point villages for regular comparative surveys for consecutive years. The plan is to survey 200 typical villages throughout North China, starting in mid-August and aiming to complete before the autumn harvest. The survey content includes production conditions, farmer income, labor and livestock, women's participation in production, expanding cotton planting area, sideline occupations, forestry and animal husbandry, water conservancy, etc., as well as issues such as how to increase farmers' purchasing power, how to develop urban-rural mutual assistance, how to improve agricultural production technology, prevent and control diseases and pests, promote and introduce production experience, and cultivate and select superior varieties. This work will be conducted in conjunction with relevant materials from departments such as local farms, promotion centers, cotton production improvement offices, epidemic prevention teams, promotion teams, water conservancy promotion societies or engineering teams, as well as supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned stores of the Ministry of Finance, to conduct special investigations.
    North China's agricultural production this year has already begun to show some planning, such as the determination of planting areas for various cash crops, etc. However, from a comprehensive perspective, this is only preliminary and incomplete. In the future, in order to further improve agricultural production, fully utilize the effectiveness of human and material resources, and gradually improve this planning, we must examine the extent to which the production plan is implemented, investigate which aspects of the plan itself are correct and which still need improvement, and study how the production plan should be combined with the farmers' requirements, that is, how to propose production plans from top to bottom and absorb the masses' reflections on the implementation of the plan from bottom to top, in order to formulate more practical agricultural production plans.
    Such a large-scale survey is unprecedented and has important significance in the absence of even basic materials left to us by China's bourgeoisie. The agricultural departments of governments at all levels and relevant units should attach importance to this survey, devote resources, and earnestly assist in carrying out this work, in order to successfully complete it.

    准备明年大生产
    华北组织农村调查
    动员三百干部调查两百个典型村
    【本报讯】为了确切了解华北农业生产的情况和问题，想出办法，以制订明年及今后的农业生产计划，华北人民政府农业部特组织各直属单位、合作银行、北大、清华两校农学院，及各省、行署、专、县等干部共三百余人，分发到华北各地进行典型调查。各项筹备工作业已就绪，八月十日至十五日将陆续出发。调查方法是将华北划为若干经济区，每一经济区选出二、三代表县，每代表县选出三、五个典型村（尽量选择以往有调查材料的村庄），每一典型村选出三分之一的代表户，认真地进行调查，并配合举行村干部或老农调查会，及参照历史材料，综述全村情况。并拟以此为基点村，连年定期调查比较。全华北计划作二百个典型村的调查，自八月中旬开始，拟于秋收前完成。调查内容计有生产情况、农民收入、劳畜力、妇女参加生产、扩大植棉面积、副业、林牧、水利等项，以及如何提高农民购买力、如何发展城乡互助、如何提高农业生产技术、防除病害虫、推广介绍生产经验和培养选择优良品种等问题，这一工作将根据各地农场、推广场、棉产改进处、防疫队、推广队、水利推进社或工程队，以及供销合作社、财政部的公营商店等部门有关材料，进行专题调查。
    华北今年的农业生产已开始带有若干计划性，如各种经济作物种植面积的决定等，但从全面来看，这还只是初步的、不完全的，今后为了进一步提高农业生产，充分发挥人力、物力的效用，逐步提高这一计划性，我们必须检查生产计划的实施的程度，考查计划本身那些是正确的，那些还须改进，并研究生产计划应如何与农民的要求相结合，也就是如何由上而下地提出生产计划与由下而上地吸收群众对实施计划的反映，才能制订更切合实际的农业生产计划。
    象这样大规模的调查是空前未有的，在中国的资产阶级没有给我们留下起码的材料的情况下，有其重要意义。各级政府的农业部门和有关单位，应重视这次调查，拿出力量，认真协助进行这一工作，以期胜利完成。
