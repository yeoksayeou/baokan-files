Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 4th—The Headquarters of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army has just released the comprehensive battle results since the Liberation Army launched a strong offensive on the Central China Front on July 10th, up to the 29th, a period of twenty days. The communiqué states: Since July 10th, our army, in coordination with fraternal troops, began the advance to eliminate the remaining bandits in Central China on a front stretching thousands of miles from Yisha in the west to the banks of the Gan River in the east. By the 29th, we had occupied Changde, an important town in western Hunan, and were advancing on Zhuzhou and Changsha. In twenty days of fighting, our army annihilated a total of 20,000 enemy troops, liberated 37 cities, dealt a heavy blow to the Song Xilian bandit gang, who vainly attempted to rely on Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou to resist stubbornly, and drove out the remaining military forces of the Chiang Kai-shek and Bai Chongxi bandit gangs in the Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi areas, paving the way for our army to advance into the southwestern provinces in the future. During the fighting, our army, with its vigorous fighting will, braved the scorching heat and torrential rain, overcame all difficulties, and continuously attacked the enemy in areas of waterways and mountains, gaining the ardent love and assistance of the people. When the enemy troops in Yichang fled, they tried to destroy all the boats on the riverbank, but the people of Jiangbei immediately brought out the hidden boats to help our army cross the river; the guerrilla forces of the people of Jiangnan also sent people to act as guides for crossing the river.
