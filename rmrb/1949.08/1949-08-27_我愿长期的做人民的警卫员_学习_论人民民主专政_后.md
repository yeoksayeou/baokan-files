　　I am Willing to Be a People's Guard for a Long Time
　　—After Studying "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship"
　　Qiu'er
　　I am a student who graduated from North China University. I graduated before the liberation of Beiping and was assigned to work in Beiping. At that time, I was full of enthusiasm, shouting "Whatever the people need me to do, I will do!" "Obey the organization's assignment!" But when I heard that I was to be a "police officer," I was shocked: "For such a pure youth like me to be a police officer, the organization is not taking good care of me." But then I thought, hadn't I already made a guarantee? So, I had to engage in a little personal heroism, still showing high spirits and shouting, "No objections, I will obey the organization's assignment." But another thought comforted me: I thought I would do it well for a year or half a year, "temporarily" obey the needs of the revolution! When the military control commission ends, I will ask to return to my alma mater to study. I thought the organization would allow it. So, when I first started working, I was still very enthusiastic.

　　Later, many classmates went south, so I asked to go south as well, but it was not allowed. I then asked to study, but this was also rejected. And the organization talked to me a lot, finally saying that I should prepare ideologically, to be a police officer for the rest of my life. This really gave me another big scare, so I was very upset and determined to study, but it was still not allowed, and they said that I should slowly get my thoughts straight. I grumbled and said, "I will never get my thoughts straight in my life. If you let me be a police officer, I will never be happy in my life." So, it dragged on for more than two months.

　　On July 1st, Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" was published. The Municipal Party Committee made unified study arrangements, and all departments enthusiastically studied it. We also started a lively study session. After a short month of study, I gained a lot of knowledge. I knew the road that the revolution would take in the future and the main experiences of the revolution, and I also understood more clearly the hypocrisy of the so-called "middle road." But what was especially important to me was that I knew that at this stage, it was not necessary to eliminate state power, but to strengthen the state apparatus in order to suppress counter-revolutionaries and protect the people's state. It is glorious to be a people's police officer. I realized that it is precisely because of the purity of youth that the Party entrusts him with this glorious and great task. Only young people who sincerely love the motherland are wanted by the people to be guards. Because only in this way can the construction of the new society be protected, can we wage a long-term and arduous struggle against the imperialists and their running dogs, and can we smash all their conspiracies and sabotage.

　　The idea of "temporarily" obeying the needs of the revolution, and then pursuing things that I am interested in; I always thought this was a very correct idea before. For example, I like to study agriculture, and I have studied some in the past. So, I can temporarily obey the needs of the revolution and be a police officer for a year and a half. What about later? I will go to specialize in studying, even go to the Soviet Union to study abroad. How wonderful it would be to run a tractor collective farm on China's vast plains in the future! I also defended myself by saying, "Doesn't the country need such specialized talents?!" What a wonderful idea! Now, after reviewing it, I realize that this is a non-proletarian idea that starts from personal interests, and it is stubbornly trying to fit personal needs into the needs of the revolution, stubbornly conforming to say that the revolution also needs "this kind," and wants the revolution to obey one's own needs. Of course, the revolution needs specialized construction talents, but it also needs guards to protect social order and defend the motherland, so that it can build a new social order on this vast land.

　　I think the idea of going south and not wanting to be a police officer is also a kind of fame and status concept. I thought that going south would allow me to develop freely, and I could also travel around the land of the motherland. How good it would be to talk about it to people in the future! As for being a police officer? At that time, I always felt that there was no future and that individuals could not develop quickly. And it was too simple and too ordinary. I always thought that the revolution was not like this, but rather something earth-shattering. Now I realize that this idea is completely wrong. Revolution is very concrete work. The so-called "earth-shattering" is a petty-bourgeois fantasy, which does not exist. We should work hard and learn from the worker-peasant cadres.

　　What are the ideological roots of these things? Where do they come from? I am a person from a petty-bourgeois background. I received more than ten years of semi-feudal and semi-colonial education from the Kuomintang in the old society, and I have been influenced by the old society. My family often used the idea of "getting promoted and making a fortune" to educate me. Especially my mother, it can be said that she "taught me earnestly," afraid that I would forget, always saying "Child: Study hard, and get an official position in the future, and your mother will also be honored." Since I was young, I have been receiving this kind of education, coupled with the influence of the old society, which has left a deep imprint in my mind, so that it is deformed into various forms of individualism and manifested. In everything, I always think of myself first, and I cannot see the whole.

　　However, I firmly believe that under the leadership and education of the Party, my individualistic ideology will gradually be transformed. Although it may change in many ways in the future, and will also find reasons to defend it, it will not be able to hide its fox tail in the end, and it will not be able to withstand the "demon-revealing mirror" of Marxism-Leninism.

　　I am very happy because I have once again defeated the enemy in my thoughts. I am willing to always be a loyal good student of Chairman Mao, and always be a people's guard.
　　August 21st, in Beiping

　　我愿长期的做人民的警卫员
    ——学习“论人民民主专政”后
    秋儿
    我是华北大学毕业的学生，在北平解放前便毕业了，被分配到北平来工作。那时真是抱着满腔的热情，高呼着“人民需要我做什么，我就做什么！”“听从组织分配！”但是当我一听到是让我当“警察”时，心里便猛的一惊：“我这样纯洁的青年去当警察，组织上太不会照顾人了。”但又一想自己不是已经做过保证了吗？于是也只得要一下个人英雄主义，仍然表现情绪高涨，喊着“没有意见，听从组织分配”。但却另有一种思想来安慰自己：心想就好好地干他一年半年吧，“暂时”地服从革命需要吧！等到军管会结束时，我再要求重回母校学习。我想组织上是会允许的。所以刚参加工作时情绪还很高。
    后来有很多同学都南下了，于是我便要求也南下，但未允许。我又接着要求去学习，但也遭拒绝了。并且组织上与我谈了很多话，最后说到要我思想上作准备，要当一辈子警察。这真使我又吓了一大跳，于是情绪非常不好，坚决的要去学习，但还未得允许，并说要我慢慢的把思想搞通。我就咕噜着说：“我一辈子思想也搞不通。让我当警察，我一辈子情绪也不会好的。”于是就这样拖了两个多月。
    七月一日，毛主席的，“论人民民主专政”发表了，市委作了统一的学习布置，各机关都热烈地学习起来了，我们也同样闹起了热烈的学习。经过短短一个月的学习，使我得到了很多的知识，我知道今后革命要走的道路与革命的主要经验，也更加明白了所谓“中间路线”的虚伪。但对我尤其重要者，使我知道在现阶段不是要消灭国家权力，而是要加强国家机器，好镇压反革命者，以保护人民的国家。做人民的警察是光荣的。使我认识到正是纯洁的青年，党才赋与他这光荣伟大的任务，只有赤诚热爱祖国的青年，人民才要他做警卫员。因为只有这样，才能保护新社会的建设，才能与帝国主义者与其走狗们，做长期坚苦的斗争，才能粉碎他们的一切阴谋破坏。
    所谓“暂时”服从革命的需要，而以后还搞自己有兴趣的东西；以前总认为这是很对的想法。例如我喜欢学农业，过去也学了一些。那么我暂时可以服从革命的需要，而当一年半载的警察，以后呢，我便要去专门学习，甚至到苏联去留学。将来在中国广大的平原上，搞拖拉机集体农场多么好呀！又替自己辩护说：“难道国家就不需要这样专门人材吗？！”多美妙的想法！现在检讨一下，才认识到这是从个人利益出发底非无产阶级的思想，是硬把个人的需要向革命的需要里面去套，硬附合着说革命也需要“这种”，而要革命服从自己的需要。固然革命需要建设的专门人材，但同时也需要保护社会秩序的警卫员，捍卫祖国，使其能在这广大的土地上，建筑起新的社会秩序。
    我想南下与不愿意当警察的思想，也是一种名誉地位观念。以为南下了便可以自由发展，也可在祖国的土地上游历一番，将来给人谈起来多么好呀！至于当警察呢？我那时总觉得没有前途，使个人不能很快的发展。而且太简单太平凡。总想着革命不是这样的，而是轰轰烈烈的。现在才认识到这种想法是完全错误的。革命就是很具体的工作。所谓“轰轰烈烈”是一种小资产阶级的幻想，是没有的。应该埋头苦干，向工农干部学习。
    这些是什么思想根源呢？怎么来的呢？我是一个小资产阶级出身的人，在旧社会里受了国民党那种半封建半殖民地的教育十几年，一直受着旧社会的影响。家庭又常用“升官发财”的思想教育我。尤其是母亲，真所谓“谆谆教诲”，怕我忘了似的，老是说“孩子：好好的上学，将来得个一官半职，娘也荣耀一番。”自幼我就受着这种教育，加以旧社会的影响，使我脑子中印下了很深的迹痕，以致变形为各种个人主义的形态而表现出来。一切事情总是先想着自己，而看不到全体。
    但是，我坚信在党的领导下，教育下，我的个人主义的思想意识，终会逐渐得到改造的。虽然今后它还可能变很多花样，也会找理由辩护它，但终久也藏不住狐狸尾巴，经不住马列主义这个“照妖镜”的。
    我很高兴，因为我又再次地战胜了我思想上的敌人。我愿永远忠诚的，做毛主席的好小学生，永远地做人民的警卫员。
    八月二十一于北平
