Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 6th: According to TASS, Paris, August 4th: Despite the Paris Police Prefecture's ban on any demonstrations during the arrival of the American Chiefs of Staff, the working people of Paris decided to hold a mass demonstration on August 5th at the Place de la Concorde in front of the American Embassy, once again protesting the policy of launching a new war and reaffirming their will for peace. Parisian newspapers published numerous announcements from progressive organizations, urging members and residents to gather at the Place de la Concorde on August 5th to present the American Embassy with resolutions expressing the unwavering will of the French people for peace and a letter to General Bradley. The Association of Fighters for Peace and Freedom, the Seine Provincial Organization of the French Communist Party, the General Confederation of Labor, the Paris Regional Federation of Trade Unions, the Republican Association of Veterans, the National Association of Former French Volunteers and Guerrilla Fighters, numerous trade union groups in the Paris region, the French Women's Union, the French Republican Youth Union, and the People's Aid Association, etc., have all issued similar announcements. The Seine Provincial Committee of the Communist Party stated in its announcement: "The American Chiefs of Staff, led by Bradley, have arrived in Paris after inspecting West European countries on the other side of the Rhine, with the aim of restoring the German army. They want to gain control of our country and its army. The instigators of a new war want to use the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty to achieve the following goals: to bankrupt France, turn it into a battlefield, turn it into a base for aggression against peace-loving people and against our ally, the Soviet Union, conscript hundreds of thousands of French youths into the army, and throw them into the slaughterhouse. This policy, decided outside of France, is against the interests of France and the cause of peace. The working people of Paris reject this policy and universally declare that they in no way consider themselves bound by the North Atlantic Treaty. The people of Paris want peace, not war! The people of Paris demand peace in Vietnam, reduced military spending, improved social security and insurance systems, and reduced taxes that are entirely borne by the working class and the middle class. Parisians demand work and the elimination of unemployment. They demand friendship with allied countries and the restoration of trade relations with the People's Democracies and the Soviet Union. They demand the disarmament of Germany, the purge of German Nazis, and the receipt of German reparations. The working people of Paris will convey their unwavering efforts to seek peace to Bradley in their resolutions and petitions. Long live peace!"
