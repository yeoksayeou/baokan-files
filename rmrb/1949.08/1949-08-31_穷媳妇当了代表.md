　　Poor Daughter-in-Law Becomes a Representative
    Cao Ergai　Du Shen
    Xiao Jiahe is a small village five miles north of Wanshou Mountain. This time, a woman representative was elected to attend the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, which surprised the villagers here, because it was something they had never heard of.
    This poor daughter-in-law's maiden name is Zhang, and her given name is Shuzhen. Her husband, Mi Enquan, is a long-time resident of Xiao Jiahe. Both of them are farmers, but they don't own any land. All year round, they rely on selling their labor and earning a living by doing odd jobs. Her husband is an honest man. When there is work in the fields, he helps others. When there is nothing to do, he carries things and pulls a handcart to earn some money to support the family. There are not many people in their family. In addition to the two of them, there is an old father and a young son. Year after year, they live frugally and work silently. After liberation, Zhang Shuzhen joined the women's group of the farmers' association and became the group leader. She is articulate and works harder than anyone else. After liberation, they felt things had changed. This time, when she came back as a representative, she felt that the world was really different.
    These days, Zhang Shuzhen tells everyone she meets about her experience as a representative. She said: "I met Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Chairman Mao told us to produce more. I think that's right. No one will oppress us in the future. As long as we produce well, we can eat well and dress well. He also told us to speak our minds. We should really produce well and support the front. When all of China is liberated, all the poor people in China will be able to stand up." These days, many villagers and women have been surrounding Zhang Shuzhen, asking her questions. Those who don't know her are also inquiring about who Zhang Shuzhen is, wanting to see what she looks like and ask what Chairman Mao looks like.

　　穷媳妇当了代表
    曹二改　杜深
    萧家河是万寿山北五里的一个小村庄，这次推举了一位妇女代表出席北平市人民代表大会，使得这里的庄稼人都很惊奇，因为这是从未听说过的事情。
    这个穷媳妇娘家姓张，她的名字叫淑贞。她丈夫米恩泉是萧家河的老住户。两口子都是庄稼汉，可是没有地，一年到头靠卖力气，替人打短挣饭吃。她丈夫是个老实人，地里有事的时候替人下地，没事的时候挑挑东西、拉拉排子车挣点钱，维持一家生活。他们家的人口不多，除了他们两口子外，还有一个老爹，一个小子。他俩一年又一年地省吃俭用，无声无息地劳动着。解放以后张淑贞参加了农会妇女小组，而且当了组长。他能说话，干活又比谁都强。解放以后他们觉着变了。这次他当代表回来，更觉着这个世界真不一样了。
    这几天张淑贞碰见人就说她当代表的情形。她说：“我见着了毛主席、朱总司令。毛主席叫我们多生产，我觉着真对，今后没有人压迫我们了，只要我们好好生产，就能吃得好穿得好。还叫我们有话就说。我们真应该好好生产、支援前线，全中国解放了，全中国的穷人也就能翻身了。”这几天许多庄稼人和妇女都围着张淑贞问长问短。不认得她的，也打听着张淑贞是谁，要看看她是什么样子，问问毛主席是什么样子。
