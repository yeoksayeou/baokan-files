The Huai River, this great river and its tributaries between the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, is related to the agriculture and transportation of several provinces, including Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. Mentioning the Huai River, many people will immediately think of the profound disasters caused by its flooding.

The Huai River originates in the Tongbai Mountains on the border of Henan and Hubei, passes through Tongbai County, crosses the Pinghan Railway at Changtaiguan, enters Anhui at Honghekou, and then flows through Zhengyangguan, Fengtai, Huaiyuan, Bengbu, Wuhe, Xuyi, and other places, converging into Hongze Lake. The mountain ridges on the south bank are undulating and close to the river, while the northwest bank is a vast expanse of fertile land with low-lying terrain. Hongze Lake plays a significant role in storing and discharging Huai River floodwaters. Downstream from Hongze Lake, the Huai River originally had a good river channel, flowing safely into the sea, rarely causing floods and disasters. During the Sui and Tang dynasties, the Huai River basin was even the wealthiest in the world. However, since the southward migration of the Yellow River during the Southern Song Dynasty, which diverted into the Huai River and flowed into the sea, the Huai River became its appendage, frequently flooding, and disasters increased daily. In the fifth year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty, the Yellow River breached at Tongwaxiang and shifted its course, and the Huai River's outlet completely relied on the Grand Canal to flow into the Yangtze River. Before the war, it directly entered the sea through the newly opened sea channel at Taozikou, northeast of Funing.

To avoid the flooding of the Huai River, efforts to guide the river began in the late Qing Dynasty. Although some projects were undertaken, the effects were minimal. During the Kuomintang rule, a Huai River Guidance Committee was established, but due to the Kuomintang's corruption and incompetence, the river guidance worsened. The people bore extremely heavy Huai River guidance expenses, but these people's blood and sweat were embezzled by the Kuomintang bandit gang, so that the Huai River was left unattended for many years, and the harm remained the same. The people along the Huai River still talk painfully about the past shocking corruption of the Kuomintang bandit gang, saying, "Building dikes with foreign flour bags could have been built!" In 1938, the Kuomintang bandit gang breached the Yellow River at Huayuankou, and the rolling Yellow River water flowed directly into the Huai River through the Jialu and Ying Rivers. From then on, all existing Huai River dikes, culverts, and other projects were destroyed, and the riverbed was generally silted up by more than two feet. Every flood season, the low-lying areas on both sides of the Huai River became a vast expanse of water, and the people were plunged into deep disaster. This year, when the Kuomintang bandit gang fled south, they wantonly excavated fortifications on the Huai River dikes, carrying out inhumane destruction. In the section of the river dike from Yuhe in Bengbu to the northwest of Huaiyuan alone, more than 7,000 war trenches and fortifications were dug by the Chiang bandits, and four breaches were dug in the west dike of the Huai River south of Jingshan.

Under the long-term disrepair and mad destruction of the Kuomintang bandit gang, what was the condition of the Huai River embankment at the time of liberation? In a word, it was "full of holes and in urgent need of repair." Although some sections of the main and branch dikes, which were 1,084 kilometers long, were still in good condition, many places, such as Zhenzhu to Nanzhaoji, Mohekou to Liuji, the west bank of the @ River, Tianjia'an to Xutai, downstream from Wuhe County to Tonghekou, and the Bengbu Huai River Railway Bridge to Linhuaiguan, the opposite bank of Shuanggou...were either dug into breaches, or had insufficient slopes, or insufficient height, or uneven height, and all needed to be repaired quickly. The important tributaries of the Huai River, such as the Hong River, Shi River, Ying River, @ River, East Fei River, West Fei River, Wo River, Hui River, Tuo River, and Sui River, were all silted up to varying degrees and had to be治理. In total, the places in Anhui Province where the Huai River's main and branch river dikes need to be repaired reached 23 million cubic meters. There are also culverts that need to be built to match, and silted沟渠 need to be疏导.

After liberation, the People's Government immediately led the people to fight against the Huai River. More than ten counties, including Fuyang, Yingshang, Woyang, Mengcheng, Fengtai, Huaiyuan, Suxian, Lingbi, Sixian, and Wuhe, started the treatment of the tributaries of the Huai River in April. The People's Government allocated 8 million catties of grain as work relief, and mobilized up to one million workers. Responsible Party and government cadres personally took the lead in carrying soil, sharing weal and woe with the people who were building, and after more than two months of efforts, 5.29 million mu of land in more than ten counties became fertile fields. On June 15, the Nanjing People's Government Water Conservancy Committee specially sent a Huai River Engineering Survey Team to Bengbu and various sections along the Huai River for surveys. The survey results showed that, except for most of the dike body from Zhengyangguan to Honghekou, which was submerged in water and could not be repaired at present, there were still more than 100 dangerous works on the remaining main and branch dike bodies, totaling 4 million cubic meters of soil in urgent need of repair. To this end, the Anhui North People's Administrative Office issued an urgent instruction: all counties along the Huai River should urgently repair these dangerous works. As a result, the entire line started construction, and Huaiyuan, Wuhe, and Sihong (a newly established county between Sixian and Hongze Lake) and other counties mobilized about 20,000 workers one after another to rush to repair. After more than 20 days of efforts, Bengbu City excavated 11,000 cubic meters of soil, and had repaired the interior of the dike body on the north bank of the city, which was 38 miles long from east to west, which had been destroyed by the Chiang bandits'交通壕,散兵坑, and机枪阵地. At the same time, the Guangji Dam, which was destroyed by the Chiang bandits at the junction of Bengbu and Fuyang, was also repaired. As of the 10th of this month, one-tenth of the total dangerous works project had been completed. The rest is being actively rescued. Under the leadership of the People's Government, the people have extremely high enthusiasm for rushing to repair the Huai River dike, and often refuse to stop work in heavy rain. They said, "The more it rains, the more we have to refuel. If the Huai River rises, everything will be over. We must repair the dikes to have a guarantee."

The annual flood season of the Huai River in July and August of the lunar calendar is approaching. At the beginning of this month, due to continuous heavy rains, the water level of the Huai River rose sharply. On the 11th, the water level at Zhengyangguan reached 19.97 meters, although it was still lower than the highest water level of 23.65 meters at that place in 1931, it was higher than the water level at the same time in previous years. With the arrival of the flood season, the work of repairing dikes and preventing floods on the Huai River has entered an extremely tense stage. In order to more systematically overcome the harm of the Huai River, the Anhui North People's Administrative Office has established the Huai River Flood Control Committee in Bengbu. The first meeting was held from the 13th to the 15th, and important decisions were made on the flood control work policy, the establishment of flood control organizations at all levels, the project plan, and the burden of expenses, and it was clearly proposed that: "comprehensive flood control, focusing on emergency repair." The entire project will be divided into three periods from July 15 to the end of September, and will be divided into stages according to administrative regions, with division of labor and responsibility, and construction will be started separately according to the importance and urgency of the project. The project funding is in principle calculated based on the benefited fields of the people, and the Anhui North Administrative Office has decided to allocate another 4 million catties of wheat as work relief. The People's Government has decided to mobilize the people with all its strength to repair dikes and prevent floods, so as to safely pass the Huai River flood season.

Undoubtedly, to overcome the harm of the Huai River is a huge project and an extremely arduous task. Due to past disrepair and serious destruction, and the current limitations of material resources, there are still many difficulties in the work, and it is impossible to achieve complete success in a short period of time. However, the People's Government is determined to do a good job in this work, which is closely related to the interests of millions of people, just as Song Richang, director of the Anhui North People's Administrative Office, said at the Huai River Flood Control Committee: "The Huai River flood control work is an important political struggle and an economic struggle. We must carry out this work in a combat posture like fighting a war. Today, we have scientific technology, the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and the strength of the people is strong. We have a complete way to overcome the Huai River flood!"

    淮河今昔
    淮河，这介于长江与黄河之间的巨川及其支流，关系着豫、皖、苏数省的农业和交通。提起淮河，很多人同时会立即想起它泛滥所给予人们的深重的灾难。
    淮河发源于豫鄂边的桐柏山，经桐柏县，在长台关穿过平汉铁路，至洪河口入皖，复经正阳关、凤台、怀远、蚌埠、五河、盱眙等地汇入洪泽湖，南岸山岗起伏距河很近，西北岸则平畴千里，地势低洼。洪泽湖对淮河洪水的蓄泄，功效是很大的。从洪泽湖以下，淮河原也具有很好的河槽，安流入海，很少汛滥成灾。隋唐时，淮河流域更富甲天下，可是自南宋黄河南迁，夺淮入海以后，淮河即成其尾附，经常汛滥，灾害与日俱增。清咸丰五年，黄河于铜瓦厢决口迁徙，淮河出路即完全借运河入江，到战前又由所辟入海水道直接经阜宁东北的套子口入海了。
    为了避免淮水泛滥，清末即开始导淮，虽然也做了些工程，然而效果甚小。在国民党统治时，曾设立导淮委员会，但是由于国民党的贪污腐化与无能，导淮却是愈导愈坏。人民负担了极其巨大的导淮经费，而这些人民的血汗却被国民党匪帮贪污了，以致淮河长年失修，为害如故。沿淮河人民，至今谈起过去国民党匪帮的惊人贪污时，都沉痛的说：“用洋面袋子筑堤也可以筑起来了！”至民国二十七年，国民党匪帮在黄河花园口决堤，于是滚滚黄水由贾鲁河、颖河直冲入淮。从此，所有淮河堤防涵闸等旧有工程，悉遭破坏，河槽普遍淤高二尺有余，每年汛期一到，淮河两岸的洼处一片汪洋，人民陷入深重的灾难之中。而今年国民党匪帮南逃时，又在淮堤上滥挖工事，作了灭绝人性的破坏，仅蚌埠玉河溜怀远西北段河堤，即被蒋匪挖战沟筑工事七千余处，荆山以南的淮河西堤被挖开四个缺口。
    在国民党匪帮长年失修和狂疯破坏的情况下，解放时淮河堤身的情况怎样呢？一句话，那就是“百孔千疮，亟需修补。”全长一千零八十四公里的支干堤身，虽尚有部分河堤较为完好，但是很多地方如镇著到南照集，沫河口到溜集、＠河西岸，田家庵至徐台，五河县以下至潼河口，蚌埠淮河铁桥至临淮关，双沟对岸……或是被挖成缺口，或是坡度不足，或是高度不足，或是高低不齐，都必需迅速修筑。淮河的重要支流如洪河、史河、颖河、＠河、东淝河、西淝河、涡河、浍河、沱河、濉河等，本身都或轻或重遭受淤塞，亦必须治理。总计在皖省的淮河支干河堤须培修的地方即达二千三百万公方。其他还有涵洞需要配合建筑，淤浅的沟渠更要加以疏导。
    解放后，人民政府立即领导人民和淮河作斗争。阜阳、颖上，涡阳、蒙城、凤台、怀远、宿县、灵璧、泗县、五河等十余县从四月份即开始了淮河支流的治理工作，人民政府拨粮八百万斤以工代赈，先后动员民工达百万人，党政负责干部均亲自带头抬土，和修筑的人民共同甘苦，经过两个多月努力，十余县中有五百二十九万亩地变为良田。六月十五日，南京人民政府水利委员会又特派淮河工程勘察队至蚌埠，及沿淮各段勘察。勘察结果，除正阳关至洪河口大部堤身浸在水中目前无法修筑外，其余支干堤身尚有百余处险工，合计四百万方土急须抢修。为此，皖北人民行政公署曾发出紧急指示：要沿淮各县对这些险工紧急抢修。于是全线动工，怀远、五河、泗洪（泗县洪泽湖之间新设县）等县曾先后动员民工约二万人抢修。蚌埠市经二十多天的努力，挖土一万一千方，则已将该市北岸东西卅八里的为蒋匪挖交通壕、散兵坑、机枪阵地所破坏的堤身内部修好。并同时修好蚌埠与阜阳交界处被蒋匪破坏的广济大闸。至本月十日统计，各段险工工程已完成全部的十分之一。其余正积极抢救中。人民在人民政府领导下，对抢修淮堤情绪极高，经常在暴雨中不肯收工，他们说：“越下雨，越要加油，淮水一涨什么都完了，一定要把堤防修好，才有保障。”
    淮河每年农历七、八月一年一度的汛期快到了。本月初，因连日大雨，淮河水位曾连续暴涨。十一日正阳关水位达一九·九七公尺，虽尚低于民国二十年该处二三·六五公尺的最高水位，但与往年同时期水位相较已经超过。随着汛期的到来，淮河的修堤防汛工作已进入极其紧张的阶段。为更有计划的战胜淮河的为害，皖北人民行政公署已在蚌埠成立淮河防汛委员会。十三日至十五日召开了首次会议，对防汛工作方针、各级防汛组织的建立、工程计划、经费负担等均作了重要决定，明确提出：“全面防汛，重点抢修”的方针。整个工程从七月十五日至九月底，分为三个时期，将按行政区域划分阶段，分工负责，视工程轻重缓急，分别次第开工。工程经费，原则上以人民受益田亩计算，皖北行署则决定再拨小麦四百万斤以工代赈。人民政府决定倾全力动员人民修堤防汛，以便安全渡过淮河汛期。
    无庸否认，要战胜淮河的为害，这是个浩大的工程也是个极其艰苦的工作。由于过去失修与严重破坏，目前物力的限制，工作中还存在不少困难，它不可能在一个短时期内立奏全功，但是人民政府有决心要把这一与千百万人民利益密切系结的工作做好，正如皖北人民行署主任宋日昌在淮河防汛委员会上所说：“淮河防汛工作是个重要的政治斗争，是个经济斗争，我们必须象打仗一样，以战斗姿态来进行这一工作。今天，我们有了科学的技术，有了共产党和人民政府的领导，人民的力量是强大的，我们完全有办法战胜淮河水灾！”
