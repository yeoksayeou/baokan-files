　　Under the Leadership of State-Owned Trading Company
  　Unified Material Purchase and Sales Method for Enterprises and Cooperatives in Xuzhou
    [Xuzhou News] In order to further control the market, unify the economic power of state-owned enterprises and cooperatives, and achieve organized and planned procurement and sales to stabilize market prices and combat speculative merchants, the Xuzhou State-Owned Trading Company convened a meeting on August 5 with relevant government departments, state-owned enterprises, and cooperatives. At the meeting they mutually reviewed shortcomings such as relying on private merchants to compete for materials, and then decided to concentrate forces to act consistently. The following four improvements were implemented for future economic work: (1) Unifying forces: All external units must establish close contact with the city's state-owned trading company. The city's trading company will be the main entity to establish a certain organization and a regular meeting system to study the situation and unify plans, eliminate the practice of acting independently and simply relying on private merchants. If any unit does not contact the company and privately purchases materials in the market, affecting prices, all its activities will be stopped. (2) In terms of acquisition, strive to achieve unified procurement or separate procurement according to a unified plan, but the steps must be consistent and the prices must be consistent. The quantity should be reasonably distributed according to needs and urgency. (3) Reduce the number of purchasers. Units that do not operate in the flour business are not allowed to hoard wheat. If there are surplus funds, they can be stored at their real value. For units that need flour, in addition to sales or allocations by the state-owned trading company, the flour mills under the city's production department should find ways to sell them at low prices. (4) In terms of sales, the trading company will assist based on supply and demand, generally adopting two methods: consignment sales or referrals.
