    Plans to Build a Pipe Factory and Afforest the Northern Suburbs
    [Our Dispatch] The Beiping Municipal Construction Bureau, in order to manage and assist all public and private construction undertakings in the city, has begun to handle the registration of construction businesses. Since the registration began, 103 companies have registered, and those that have been reviewed are about to be issued licenses. Among those that have been reviewed, 32 are Class A, 15 are Class B, and 24 are Class C. Eight are pending inquiry, and others are still under investigation and review. Construction companies that have not been reviewed by the Municipal Construction Bureau and issued certificates by the People's Government will have their qualifications to contract for construction projects revoked.
    [Another Dispatch] The Construction Bureau is preparing to establish a pipe factory. The bureau has already sent personnel to the new urban area in the western suburbs to carry out preparatory work and organization. It is expected that production will officially begin in the middle of next month. The first products of the factory will be cement pipes, which will be used exclusively for the city's and the new urban area's drainage systems.
    [Another Dispatch] The Construction Bureau is taking advantage of the rainy season to carry out small-scale afforestation outside Di'anmen. Seedlings are supplied by the Ditan Nursery. The process of pruning seedlings began on the 5th of this month, and the transporting and planting began on the 8th. As of the 15th, the entire project has been completed, with a total of more than 3,500 cypress trees planted, covering an area of approximately 14 mu.
