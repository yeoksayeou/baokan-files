    North China Government Decides
    to Establish Grain Bureaus at All Levels
    [Ping City News] The North China People's Government has recently decided to establish the North China Grain General Bureau, provincial grain sub-bureaus, directly-administered municipal supply bureaus, and a number of grain depots (large grain depots may be attached with processing factories as needed). On August 5th, it ordered all administrative offices, provinces, and directly-administered municipalities to immediately begin the work of establishing bureaus and depots in order to strengthen future financial allocation and urban food supply, as well as the storage and transportation of public grain, change the decentralized storage system of the past wartime, and gradually establish highly centralized large grain depots. This will make allocation and transportation more flexible and save on transportation costs. It is hoped that this work can be largely completed before the end of September to facilitate the autumn grain collection.
