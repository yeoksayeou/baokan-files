Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 10th: TASS, Sofia, 8th: The rural electrification led by the Bulgarian People's Democratic Government is developing with the active help of the people. Since September 1944, more than nine hundred villages have gained electricity supply. The local power transmission lines alone cost 2.35 million leva (Bulgarian currency). The voluntary labor of the broad masses for rural electrification is valued at more than 600 million leva. During the entire period of bourgeois rule in Bulgaria, only 768 residential areas had electricity, and 138 of them were only partially electrified. During the first Five-Year Plan, 1,826 rural areas in Bulgaria will be electrified.

    保农村电气化发展
    九百多村获得电气供应
    【新华社北平十日电】塔斯社索非亚八日讯：保加利亚人民民主政府领导进行的农村电气化，正在人民的积极帮助下发展着。自一九四四年九月以来，已有九百多村庄获得了电气供应。仅地方输电路线一项，即耗去二百三十五万利瓦（保币）。广大人民为农村电气化而作的义务劳动，价值达六亿利瓦以上。保加利亚在资产阶级统治的整个时期，统共只有七百六十八个居民区有电气，而其中一百三十八个还只是部分电气化。在第一个五年计划期间，保国将有一千八百二十六个乡村区实现电气化。
