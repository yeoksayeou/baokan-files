Of the more than 100 lines damaged in the Nantai district, more than 30 have been repaired. Postal services have also never been interrupted and have begun to resume mail service with other liberated areas. Wireless telegraph communication with Shanghai, Wenzhou, and other places was restored on the second day of liberation (August 18th). City buses only stopped running for one day on the 17th and resumed service on the evening of the 18th.

The company's "Fujian" ship, which was stranded in Nanping, returned to Fuzhou as soon as it heard of the liberation of Fuzhou. Merchant ships carrying goods from various places have also entered Fuzhou one after another. The urban area of Fuzhou is now bustling with traffic and in good order. Transportation within the city and to northern Fujian has been restored, except for long-distance buses.
