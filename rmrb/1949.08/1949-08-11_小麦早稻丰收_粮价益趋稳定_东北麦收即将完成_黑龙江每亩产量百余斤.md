    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th. The harvesting of 5,750,000 mu of wheat fields in the entire Northeast is about to be completed. Heilongjiang Province, the main wheat-producing area in the Northeast, began harvesting on a large scale at the end of last month. The province's 3,069,500 mu of wheat fields are expected to be completely harvested within days. Although this year's wheat crop in the province was affected by diseases and drought, it is still a rare bumper harvest in recent years. The average yield per mu is about 110 jin, with an estimated total harvest of over 165,000 tons. Among them, the harvest of Soviet-seed wheat is the highest, with full grains and the earliest maturity. This year's bumper wheat harvest has laid a good foundation for expanding the wheat planting area in the province next year. Next year, the province plans to plant 4.5 million mu of wheat, and strive to improve quality and promote excellent varieties. This year, the province sowed more than 46,000 mu of Soviet-seed wheat, and next year it will be promoted to 200,000 mu. Wheat-producing areas in Liaoxi, Liaodong, and Songjiang provinces have also largely completed harvesting. Some areas in Liaoxi and Liaodong provinces have been affected by rust and smut diseases, resulting in poor harvests. For example, in Liaoyang County, Liaodong, more than 210,000 mu of wheat fields suffered from rust and spring drought, resulting in only 60-70% of a normal harvest. In Liaozhong County, Liaoxi Province, 209,000 mu of wheat were also affected by rust, resulting in only 50-60% of a normal harvest. The drought in Jilin and Songjiang provinces affected the wheat harvest, especially in Songjiang Province, where wheat generally suffered from poor harvests this year. During the wheat harvest, the People's Governments of various provinces, in addition to urging counties to harvest carefully and thoroughly, also emphasized paying attention to seed selection to prevent the occurrence of rust next year. The Songjiang Provincial People's Government also sent technicians to wheat-producing areas to help with seed selection. In order to protect the interests of farmers and solve the current problem of food shortages for farmers, the Commercial Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee has instructed its subordinate grain agencies to purchase wheat at a ratio of two jin of coarse grains to one jin of medium-quality wheat. Liaoxi Province has allocated 3,750 tons of coarse grains to purchase wheat from farmers, in order to combat the speculative activities of unscrupulous merchants who purchase at low prices. Trade companies and grain companies in various counties of Songjiang Province also purchase wheat seeds with cash and coarse grains at prices higher than the market price.

    小麦早稻丰收
    粮价益趋稳定
    东北麦收即将完成
    黑龙江每亩产量百余斤
    【新华社沈阳十日电】全东北五百七十五万亩麦田的收割工作，即将完成。东北主要产麦区之黑龙江省，在上月底即普遍开镰，全省三百零六万九千五百余亩麦田，日内可全部割完。今年该省小麦虽受病害及天旱等影响，但仍为近数年来少有的丰收。每亩平均产量为一百一十斤左右，估计全部可收十六万五千余吨。其中以苏联种小麦收获量最高，籽粒饱满，成熟期最早。今年的小麦丰收，已为该省明年扩大种麦面积打下良好基础。明年全省计划种麦四百五十万亩，并做到提高质量，推广优良品种。今年全省播种苏联种小麦四万六千余亩，明年将推广至二十万亩。辽西、辽东、松江等省产麦区亦已大部收割完毕。辽西、辽东等省若干地区受到疸害及黑穗病等影响，收成不好。如辽东之辽阳县二十一万余亩麦田由于生疸害和春旱，只有六、七成年景。辽西省辽中县二十万九千余亩小麦亦因疸害而只有五、六成年景。吉林、松江省麦田因旱灾影响了收成，特别是松江省的小麦今年普遍的歉收。麦收中，各省人民政府除督促各县及时细割细收外，并强调注意选种，以防来年发生疸害。松江省人民政府并派技术人员赴产麦区帮助选种。为了保护农民利益和解决农民目前吃粮困难，东北行政委员会商业部已指示所属粮食机关，按两斤高粮合一斤中等小麦之比价进行收购。辽西省已拨出粗粮三千七百五十吨收购农民小麦，以打击奸商贱价收购的投机倒把行为。松江省各县贸易公司及粮食公司也以现款和粗粮高于市价收买麦种。
