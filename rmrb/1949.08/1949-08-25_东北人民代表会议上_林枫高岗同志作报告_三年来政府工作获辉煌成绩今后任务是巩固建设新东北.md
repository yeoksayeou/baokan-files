(Xinhua News Agency) The Northeast People's Representative Conference solemnly opened in Shenyang on the 21st. Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, delivered the opening address on behalf of the Presidium of the Conference, pointing out the great contributions of the people of Northeast China and the Northeast People's Liberation Army – the Fourth Field Army – in the more than three years of the Liberation War and the recovery and construction. He also expressed gratitude to the CPC Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee for their leadership of the Political Committee, and especially thanked Marshal Stalin and the Soviet Red Army under his leadership for their indelible contribution to liberating the people of Northeast China from Japanese rule. Lin Feng, Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, gave a report on the government's work over the past three years. On the 22nd, Gao Gang, Secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, gave a report on the Northeast Bureau's suggestions regarding the Northeast People's Government's policy guidelines.

Chairman Lin Feng's government work report was divided into six parts: supporting the war, land reform, economic construction, education and health, public security and justice, and democratic construction. In his report, which lasted several hours, he described in detail the brilliant achievements and certain shortcomings of each task. He reviewed the overall situation in Northeast China over the past three years, saying: "The Kuomintang reactionaries, under the instruction and assistance of American imperialism, launched a large-scale attack on the people of Northeast China, attempting to place them again under the rule of the traitorous government and American imperialism. Therefore, the establishment of the Northeast Administrative Committee faced numerous difficulties. However, thanks to the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau, the heroic struggle of the people of Northeast China, the strong coordination of the liberated areas within the Pass, and the support of the broad masses of people for the People's Liberation War against American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek, the situation was reversed, and we moved to the counter-offensive, finally achieving complete liberation."

In his report, Gao Gang first pointed out that the task of the Northeast People's Representative Conference and the Northeast People's Government to be established is to systematically and step-by-step carry out political, economic, military, and cultural construction, especially to vigorously engage in the restoration and development of the people's economy to support the National Liberation War, create important conditions for national industrialization, and thereby gradually improve and raise the people's living standards, consolidate and build a new Northeast. In order to more smoothly complete this historic task, we must earnestly learn from the Soviet people's spirit and experience of hard struggle in overcoming the blockade and intervention of imperialist powers after the victory of the October Revolution, as well as the Soviet Union's construction experience, technology, and management methods in the subsequent period, in order to overcome difficulties and accelerate our construction process. He then systematically reported on the Northeast's economy, people's culture, health undertakings, national defense construction, public security and justice, and the principle of equality among all nationalities, as well as the further democratization of political power construction, from the perspectives of ideology, principles, and specific steps. Finally, he emphasized that the Communist Party members in the government must closely cooperate with non-Party members.

　　东北人民代表会议上
  　林枫高岗同志作报告
    三年来政府工作获辉煌成绩今后任务是巩固建设新东北
    【本报讯】据新华社电：东北人民代表会议二十一日在沈阳隆重开幕，东北行政委员会副主席高崇民代表大会主席团致开幕词时，指出东北人民和东北人民的子弟兵——第四野战军在三年多的解放战争和恢复建设事业中的伟大贡献，并感谢中共中央毛主席和中共中央东北局对政委会的领导，特别感谢斯大林大元帅及其领导下的苏联红军使东北人民从日寇统治下解放出来的不可磨灭的功绩。东北行政委员会主席林枫作了三年来政府工作的报告。二十二日，中共中央东北局书记高岗代表东北局作了关于东北人民政府施政方针建议的报告。
    林枫主席的政府工作报告分作支援战争、土地改革、经济建设、教育卫生、公安司法、民主建设六个部分。在长达数小时的报告中他详细叙述了各项工作的光辉成绩和某些缺点。他回顾东北三年来的整个形势说：“国民党反动派在美帝国主义指示帮助下，向东北人民大举进攻，企图重置东北人民于卖国政府及美帝国主义统治下，因而东北行政委员会成立时面临重重困难。但由于中共中央和东北局的正确领导，东北人民的英勇斗争，关内各解放区的有力配合，以及广大人民对于反对美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石的人民解放战争的支援，因而扭转了战局，转入反攻，最后达到全部解放。”
    高岗在报告中首先指出：东北人民代表会议和即将产生的东北人民政府的任务，就是有系统地和有步骤地进行政治、经济、军事和文化的建设，特别是大力从事人民经济事业的恢复和发展，以支援全国解放战争，为全国工业化创造重要条件，并从而逐渐改善和提高人民生活，巩固和建设新的东北。为更顺利地完成这一历史任务，必须认真地学习苏联人民在十月革命胜利后战胜帝国主义列强封锁干涉的艰苦奋斗精神和经验，以及其后时期苏联的建设经验、技术和管理方法，以便克服困难，加速我们建设的过程。接着他对于东北的经济、人民文化、卫生事业、国防建设、公安司法等工作及各民族平等的原则，和政权建设的进一步民主化等问题，分别从思想、方针及具体步骤作了系统报告。最后他强调提出：政府中的共产党员必须与党外人士亲密合作。
