Who Likes Tito's "Socialism"?
Italian Communist "Unità" Newspaper Publishes Special Article Exposing It

[Special Translation from Our Newspaper] The Italian newspaper "Unità" recently published an article on Yugoslav nationalists, written by Comrade Pietro Secchia, representative General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party.

After discussing the shameful defeat of the Yugoslav nationalists in the Trieste elections and the conspiracy activities of the Tito clique, Comrade Secchia ridiculed those "theoreticians" who completely denied the important significance of the Soviet Union's liberation of Yugoslavia and other countries enslaved by fascist occupation. These "theoreticians" also delusionally tried to erase the heroic deeds of thousands upon thousands of Soviet, Polish, French, and Italian anti-German fighters from the hearts of the people.

The author wrote: "If it were not for the assistance of the Soviet army, even though the Yugoslav guerrillas fought extremely bravely, it would not have been possible to liberate their country at that time. Does the Tito clique really think the people are so ignorant as to be unaware of this ironclad fact? When the Soviet Red Army reached the Yugoslav border, advancing in Hungary and the Vojvodina region, three-quarters of Yugoslav territory, as well as most cities and the population, were still occupied and controlled by German fascist forces. As early as 1944, the Yugoslav guerrilla movement faced a major crisis. Due to the German paratrooper offensives, guerrilla warfare was forced to disperse, weakening its strength, and only after the rapid support of the Soviet Red Army liberated Belgrade did the victory of the Yugoslav people become possible. Does the Tito clique really think Italy is unaware of the above facts?"

In connection with the above points, regarding the situation in which the Italian liberation movement had developed, Comrade Secchia continued to write:

"Precisely because we did not receive direct and concrete support from socialist countries, our resistance against German-Italian fascism did not achieve complete victory."

The Tito clique boasted to the world that they could build socialism with their own strength. After exposing the inevitable failure of the Tito clique, Comrade Secchia asked:

"Leaving the socialist world – the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, the peace-defending movement of the working people – and with the help of imperialists and the Marshall Plan, what kind of socialism can the Tito clique establish? Its 'socialism' has already been stained with the heavy atmosphere of national socialism, a 'socialism' liked by Trumans, de Gaulles, the standard 'Third Force,' and all the conspirators of imperialism!"

Comrade Secchia said in his conclusion: "Socialism, the working class, and the Soviet Union are an inseparable concept. Loyalty to socialism also means loyalty to the working class, loyalty to the great socialist motherland, and loyalty to proletarian internationalism."

### 谁喜欢铁托的“社会主义”？  意共“团结”报刊载专文予以揭露

    谁喜欢铁托的“社会主义”？
    意共“团结”报刊载专文予以揭露
    【本报特译】意大利“团结”报上最近刊载了一篇论南斯拉夫民族主义者的文章，作者为意共代表总秘书庇埃特罗·塞克奇亚同志。
    于论及南斯拉夫民族主义者在的里雅斯特选举中可耻的失败和铁托集团的阴谋活动后，塞克奇亚同志嘲笑了那些把苏联解放南斯拉夫以及其他遭受法西斯占领奴役国家的重要意义完全否认的“理论家”，正是这些“理论家”，他们同时也妄想把成千成百的苏维埃的、波兰的、法国和意大利的抗德战士们的英雄行为自人民的心目中抹去他的光彩。
    作者写道：“假若没有苏联军队的援助，虽然南斯拉夫的游击战士作战异常英勇，当时也不可能解放他们的国土，难道铁托集团竟认为人民愚昧到这种程度以至连这个铁一般的事实也无知吗？在苏联红军攻抵南斯拉夫边界，在匈牙利和窝耶窝地那区进军时，那时南斯拉夫国土的四分之三以及大部分城市和人口仍为德国法西斯军盘据和控制。远在一九四四年南斯拉夫游击战运动曾面临重大危机，由于德寇的伞兵攻势游击战事曾被迫分散活动而致力量削弱，而且只有在苏联红军的迅速支援解放了贝尔格莱德以后南斯拉夫人民的胜利才有了可能；铁托集团难道也认为意大利对上述事实也毫不知道吗？”
    联系及上述观点，关于意大利解放运动曾经发展的形势，塞克奇亚同志继续写道：
    “正因为我们没有获得来自社会主义国家直接和具体的支援，我们当时反抗德义法西斯的结果未能得到完全胜利”。
    铁托集团曾向世界夸口说以他自己的力量可以建设社会主义。于揭露铁托集团必然招致失败后，塞克奇亚同志问道：
    “离开了社会主义世界——苏联、人民民主国家、劳动人民的保卫和平运动，而借帝国主义者及马歇尔计划之助，铁托集团能建立起一个什么样的社会主义呢？它的‘社会主义’已为国家社会主义的浓重气息所玷污，那是一种为杜鲁门们、戴高乐们、标准的‘第三种力量’以及帝国主义者的一切阴谋分子所喜爱的‘社会主义’！”
    塞克奇亚同志于其结语中说：“社会主义、工人阶级和苏联是一个不能分割的观念。对社会主义的忠诚也即意味着对工人阶级的忠诚，对伟大的社会主义祖国的忠诚和对无产阶级的国际主义的忠诚。”（原载七月一日“争取持久和平与人民民主”）
