Conserves Rice to Support the Troops
[This Municipality News] The entire body of students in the Cadres-in-training Class of the CCP Beiping Municipal Committee are conserving to support the troops. In addition to sending 1,700 jin of millet saved over ten days to the Municipal Government Administrative Office for forwarding to the front lines, they also initiated a donation and letter-writing campaign to support the troops. The workers' branch of the Telecommunications Bureau alone donated 22,000 yuan. In their letters of慰劳, they wrote: "You are winning battles at the front, and we are supporting you from the rear and protecting the fruits of victory."
