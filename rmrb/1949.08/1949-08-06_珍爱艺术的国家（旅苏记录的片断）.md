    A Country That Treasures Art
    (Fragments of a Trip to the Soviet Union)
    Gu Yuan
    We went to attend the World Congress of Supporters of Peace and traveled in the Soviet Union for more than ten days. On our way back home, we visited Moscow and Leningrad for another ten days, and visited many economic and cultural constructions in the Soviet Union. Now I will tell readers about some of the scenes of Soviet art that I saw.
    We entered the Soviet Union on April 4th, taking two very comfortable train carriages. The carriages were decorated with many art pictures—reproductions of works by famous Soviet painters and art photos recording the peaceful construction of the Soviet Union. The windows were covered with two layers of curtains, one dark and one light. The carriages were filled with music broadcast from Moscow. The train sped from east to west, taking nine days and nights to reach Moscow. Along the way, passing through countless large and small train stations, we saw that many of the stations had full-length or half-length three-dimensional statues of Lenin, Stalin, and other Soviet people's leaders. Many stations were also decorated with bas-reliefs depicting realistic life content, all of which were very exquisite works of art. Sometimes we went inside the stations to visit, and saw many huge murals and oil paintings, all depicting content that the Soviet people loved to see in a realistic style, such as: portraits and half-length portraits of the Soviet people's beloved leaders, deeds of the revolutionary war and the laughter of the people's victory, the restoration of work, and the labor scenes of various productive constructions. I went into a children's waiting room, which was playing very pleasant music. The ceiling was painted with very beautiful Russian national decorative patterns. Many crystal-like chandeliers were suspended, and the walls were hung with many oil paintings on the theme of Russian fairy tales, all works by many brilliant Soviet artists. I saw many healthy and happy children, as well as women and men accompanying these children, waiting very happily in such a warm and comfortable art hall for the arrival of the train. In every station, there was one or several newsstands, providing travelers and citizens with various books, newspapers, picture albums, and reproductions of famous paintings. Just from the facilities of the train stations along the Siberian Railway, we have already seen how rich the cultural life of the Soviet people is.
    I visited the Moscow Gallery. The gallery displays famous paintings and a small number of sculptures from the eleventh century to the present (most of the sculptures are displayed elsewhere). I didn't ask about the number of works, but I can say that if every painting is carefully appreciated, it would take a month to appreciate them all. The light in the exhibition room comes in from the roof, and the audience can sit on soft sofas under bright and soft light to comfortably appreciate the countless famous paintings here.
    The first half is famous paintings left over from various centuries in Russia before the October Revolution. Many of them are excellent paintings depicting the life of the Russian people very profoundly. There are about two hundred large works by Repin and Surikov (the two greatest painters of the 19th century in Russia), as well as works by thousands of other painters, such as Perov's "Funeral of a Peasant" and Pukirev's "Unequal Marriage," all of which profoundly reflect the life of the Russian people in the old Russian era. It is a pity that my visiting time was too short to appreciate them all carefully. Many works praising the old Russian aristocratic class and promoting religion are also displayed here, but the audiences here have clear critical abilities. The Soviet people can gain knowledge from schools and also receive education from many public places. Here, I want to briefly describe the staff who explain the paintings to the audience in the gallery. These staff members are all graduates of art history from universities. They see this work as part of the country's great cause, and they enthusiastically help the audience appreciate famous paintings here every day. They not only explain the content of each painting and some simple specialized knowledge of the techniques for the audience, but also introduce the social environment and ideological activities of the painters at that time, and make correct criticisms of the works from all aspects. Although we only stayed for three hours, we have already learned a lot of knowledge.
    The second half of the gallery displays works after the October Revolution. The first strong impression is that the Soviet Union has cultivated so many excellent painters and produced so many excellent works in the thirty years since the Soviet revolution—all of which depict the real life of the Soviet people in a realistic style. There are countless works recording the masses of the revolution attacking the reactionary rulers, the collapse of the decadent class, and the victory of the working class and the laboring people; there are many, many paintings depicting the portraits of the great people's leaders and their harmonious emotions with the people; reflecting the military and civilian life in the heroic patriotic war, exposing the ferocious faces of the fascist invaders and their destruction; praising the construction of socialism in all aspects… The paintings here not only depict the people and praise the people, but are also entirely owned by the people. Standing in front of the paintings, we felt very excited, very admired, and very reluctant to leave.
    The Soviet people cherish their works of art very much. I saw a very good sculpture in Leningrad called the Bronze Horseman—Peter the Great riding on horseback, the horse standing up, its hind hooves stepping on a struggling snake (the snake represents Russia's backward system). This sculpture is forty or fifty feet high and stands on the banks of the Neva River. When Leningrad was besieged by German fascist bandits, it was not easy to move this work of art to a safe area. The people of Leningrad, under the enemies' shells and bombs, under hunger and cold, heroically resisted the mad invaders, while also protecting many works of art. They spent a lot of effort transporting a large amount of soil, piling it around the Bronze Horseman, and covering the Bronze Horseman in an artificially created earth hill, so that bombs and shells could not harm it.
    The heroic people of Leningrad, during the nine hundred days and nights of being besieged by the enemy, also preserved the Winter Palace, one of the world's four largest art museums. They transported 1.7 million valuable works of art to a safe place. Most of the works of art here are bulky, such as various marble sculptures, giant gemstone utensils, etc. This was a very arduous task. During the war, the Winter Palace was hit by thirty-one shells and two bombs, and part of the exquisite ceilings and other art buildings were destroyed. After the German bandits were driven out, the buildings destroyed by shells and bombs were quickly repaired, and 1.7 million bulky and extremely valuable works of art stood in their original positions again. When we entered a very magnificent and luxurious hall, the staff member guiding us said: "During the war, the roof of this hall was completely destroyed, and the floor was covered with snow..." We were very surprised that we could not find any traces of the damage. There are more than a thousand halls here, and the length of the corridors is a total of eighty Chinese miles, displaying millions of valuable works of art from ancient and modern times around the world. This is a great art museum, and also a great education hall. I saw many teams of students standing in front of the works of art under the leadership of teachers to learn history, geography, and other knowledge. Being in it, we felt very excited, very admired, and very reluctant to leave.
    Due to space limitations, I will stop here.

    珍爱艺术的国家
    （旅苏记录的片断）
    古元
    我们去出席世界拥护和平大会，在苏联境内旅行十多天。回国途中，又在莫斯科和列宁格勒两城游览了十天，参观了苏联许多经济文化上的建设。我现在把所看见的苏联美术方面的片断情景告诉读者。
    我们于四月四日进入苏联国境，乘坐两节十分舒适的火车。车厢里挂着许多美术图片——是苏联名画家的作品（印刷品）和记录苏联和平建设的美术照片，窗户上挂着深颜色和浅颜色的两层窗帘，车厢里洋溢着从莫斯科播送出来的音乐。列车从东往西疾走，经过九昼夜的漫长旅程才到达莫斯科。这一路上，经过无数的大小火车站，我们看见许许多多的车站上都竖立着列宁、斯大林及其他的苏联人民领袖的全身或半身的立体雕像。有好些车站，还装饰着现实生活内容的浮雕都是非常精致的艺术品。有时我们走进车站里面游览，看见许多巨幅的壁画及油画都是以写实的手法，描绘苏联人民所喜闻乐见的内容，如：苏联人民所爱戴的领袖生活画像及半身肖像，革命战争的事迹和人民胜利的欢笑，恢复工作及各种生产建设的劳动情景。我走进一间儿童候车厅，里面放送着非常悦耳的音乐，天花板上描绘着非常美丽的俄国民族的装饰图案画，悬吊着许多水晶岩一样的吊灯，四壁挂着许多以俄国童话为题材的油画，都是苏联许多高明的艺术家的作品。我看见许多健康快乐的儿童，以及携带这些儿童一同候车的妇女和男人们，非常幸福的在这样一间温暖又安适的美术厅里等候着列车的到来。在每一个车站里，都有一个或几个画报摊，供给旅客和公民们各种书籍报纸画报及名画的印刷品。仅仅从西伯利亚铁路沿线的火车站的设备上看，我们已经看见苏联人民的文化生活是多么的富裕。
    我参观过莫斯科画廊。画廊里陈列着俄国十一世纪到现在有名的绘画及小部分雕刻（雕刻大部分陈列在别的场所），我没有探问作品的件数，但我可以这样说，如果每一幅画都仔细欣赏，花一个月的工夫也欣赏不完。陈列室里面的光线是从屋顶上透进来的，观众可以在明亮而又柔和的光线下面，可以坐在柔软的沙发上面，舒适地来欣赏这里无数的名画。
    前半部是十月革命以前俄国各个世纪所遗留下来的名画，许许多多是描写俄国的人民生活非常深刻的优秀画幅，列宾及苏里可夫（俄国十九世纪最伟大的两位画家）的巨幅作品约有二百多幅，还有其他成千位画家的作品，如悲洛夫的“贫农葬礼”，布格洛夫的“不平等的婚姻”等，都深刻地反映了旧俄时代的俄国人民生活。只可惜我参观的时间太短，不能普遍仔细欣赏。这里也陈列了许多歌颂旧俄贵族阶级及宣扬宗教的作品，但是，这里的观众们，他们是有着明确的批判能力的。苏联的人民，他们可以从学校里获得知识，也可以从许许多多的公共场合里得到教育。在这里，我要简单叙述在画廊里为观众作解说的职员们。这些职员们，都是大学校里研究美术史的毕业生。他们看这件工作是国家的伟大事业的一部分，他们天天在这里热心的帮助观众欣赏名画。他们不只为观众解说每幅画的内容及技术上的一些简单专门知识，而且也介绍画家当时的社会环境及其思想活动，并对作品从各方面作正确的批判。我们虽短短的停留三小时，已经学到不少的知识了。
    画廊的后半部是陈列十月革命以后的作品。第一个强烈印象就是苏联革命以后三十年来竟能造就出这么众多的优秀画家，产生了这样多的优秀作品——都是以写实的手法，描写苏联人民的现实生活。这里有无数篇幅记载了革命的群众向反动的统治者进攻，没落阶级的崩溃与工人阶级及劳动人民胜利的情景；有很多很多画幅描绘伟大的人民领袖的画像及其与人民群众连结一体的融洽情感；反映了英勇的爱国战争中的军民生活，暴露了法西斯侵略者的狰狞面目及其覆没；歌颂着社会主义各方面的建设……这里的绘画，不只是描写人民，歌颂人民，而且完全为人民所有。我们站立在画幅的面前，非常感奋，非常敬佩，非常留恋。
    苏联的人民，极珍爱他们的艺术品。我在列宁格勒看见一座很好的雕刻，名叫铜骑士——彼得大帝骑在马背上，马站立起来，马的后蹄踏着一条在挣扎着的大蛇（大蛇代表俄国的落后制度）。这座雕刻有四五丈高，站立在涅瓦河畔。当列宁格勒被德国法西斯匪徒围攻的时候，这件艺术品是不容易移运到安全地带去的。列宁格勒的人民，在敌人的炮弹炸弹下，饥饿寒冷下英勇地抗御着疯狂的侵略者，同时又保护着许多的美术品。他们花了很大的气力运来大批的泥土，围绕着铜骑士的四周堆积起来，把铜骑士掩盖在人工制造的土山里，使炸弹炮弹不能伤害着它。
    英雄的列宁格勒人民，在九百昼夜被敌人围困的岁月中，同时把世界上最大的四大美术馆之一的冬宫保存起来。他们把一百七十万件贵重的美术品运到安全的地方。这里的美术品大部分是笨重的，如各种大理石的雕刻，巨型的宝石器皿等。这是一件非常艰巨的工作。战争期间，冬宫挨了三十一发炮弹和两颗炸弹，精美的天花板及其他美术建筑物被毁坏了一部分。德国匪徒被驱逐以后，被炮弹炸弹所毁坏的建筑物很快就被修复，一百七十万件笨重的极宝贵的美术品又在原来的地位站立起来了。当我们走进一间非常宏伟华丽的大厅，引导我们参观的一位职员说：“战争的时候这间大厅的房顶完全被毁坏了，地板上积满了雪……”我们非常惊奇的是竟找不到一点当日的伤痕。这里有一千多间大厅，走廊的长度一共八十华里，陈列着数百万件世界上古今以来的珍贵艺术品。这是一座伟大的美术馆，同时也是一座伟大的教育馆，我看见很多成队成队的学生在教师的率领下站在美术品的面前学习历史、地理等知识。我们置身其中，非常感奋，非常敬佩，非常留恋。
    篇幅所限，就写到这里为止吧。
