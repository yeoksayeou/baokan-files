    ▲ To respond to the school's half-day labor initiative, the central district is scheduled to hold it on the 9th and 10th. The labor location is from the Nine-Dragon Wall of Beihai to the Five-Dragon Pavilion, aiming to repair a 100-meter-long flat road and build brick walls along the roadside. The participants from this district to repair this road are No. 4 Middle School, Wenzhi, and Guanghua. Every ten people will be divided into a labor group, and model road repair groups will be selected. The first place will be awarded a red flag, and all participants will be given a bookmark as a souvenir. In order to win the red flag, all students are actively preparing. No. 4 Middle School took the lead in challenging other schools, determined to strive for the red flag.
