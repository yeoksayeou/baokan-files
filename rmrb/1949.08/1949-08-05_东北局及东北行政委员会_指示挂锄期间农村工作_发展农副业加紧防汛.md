[Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station broadcast on the 4th] The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Northeast Administrative Committee issued instructions on work in rural areas during the hoeing season. The instructions pointed out that the central task during the hoeing season is still to develop agriculture, especially sideline production. Other work should be carried out around production. At present, leadership over production should be strengthened, including flood control, selection of wheat seeds, pressing of green manure, cutting sheep grass, leaving autumn fallow, rushing to cultivate late fields, developing sideline occupations, and completing various preparations for the autumn harvest. In addition, it is necessary to develop supply and marketing cooperatives, train cadres, and seize the struggle to ban reactionary secret societies such as Yiguandao, combining it with the struggle to suppress bandits and strike at landlords who are trying to reverse the verdicts, in order to consolidate the masses' advantage, raise the masses' awareness, and eliminate the activities of reactionary remnants. The above tasks can be studied and implemented by various regions in accordance with their local conditions.
