    [Ping City News] Wang Heishuan and others from Xinle County, Hebei Province, who sabotaged transportation and stole electric wires, have been arrested and sentenced by the government. Wang Heishuan used to be a village cadre, but was removed from his position after land reform due to his poor work style. However, he did not change his ways and continued to eat, drink, and accumulate debts, leading him to steal. He first colluded with Mo Xier and others to steal four bags of public grain wheat from the village government in February of last year. Subsequently, since April of last year, he repeatedly stole telephone wires. Wang himself stole them once alone, and colluded with others to steal them six times, totaling more than 450 jin of stolen wires, which were sold for money. It is stipulated that protecting electric wires and strictly prohibiting theft, the North China People's Government has long issued clear orders. Wang Heishuan and others repeatedly stole wires, violating national laws and disciplines. The Xinle County Government arrested them and submitted the case to the North China People's Government, which sentenced the principal offender Wang Heishuan to fifteen years in prison, and accomplices Mo Popen and Mo Fushan to ten years in prison, and Mo Xier to eight years in prison.
