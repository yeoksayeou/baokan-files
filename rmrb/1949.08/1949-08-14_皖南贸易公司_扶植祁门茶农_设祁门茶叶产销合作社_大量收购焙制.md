    Wannan Trading Company
    Supports Qimen Tea Farmers
    Establishes Qimen Tea Production and Sales Cooperative
    Massively Purchases and Roasts Tea
    [Qimen News] The ancient and simple mountain city of Qimen owes its fame at home and abroad entirely to its special product, renowned both locally and internationally – "Qihong" (Keemun black tea).
    Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, tea farmers were subjected to unreasonable and severe exploitation, and production declined sharply. This spring tea season, the Kuomintang bandit government, in order to preserve its moribund existence, frantically conscripted soldiers and grain, blockaded transportation, causing farmers to wander to other places and their tea to be left unbought.
    On April 26th, our army liberated Qimen. After the establishment of the People's Government, it actively protected the interests of tea farmers, first by establishing the "Qimen Tea Production and Sales Cooperative" to massively purchase tea. The state-owned Wannan Trading Company sent personnel to Qimen on May 17th to establish an office, and began massively purchasing and roasting tea.
    To facilitate the farmers, the Qimen Office of the Wannan Trading Company specifically established four tea collection points in Qimen, Hankou, Pingli, and Wuxikou. Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, farmers were often exploited with large scales of twenty-four or twenty-five ounces per "jin" (catty). After liberation, the principle of fair trade was adopted, with sixteen ounces to a "jin". Consequently, the roads to the four tea collection points were filled with an endless stream of tea farmers, and the offices were bustling with activity. Since the establishment of the office, in just six short weeks, it purchased 328,720 "jin" of crude red and green tea. The People's Government is now working on refining the tea, and plans to produce more than 600,000 "jin" of refined tea this year. In this way, the output will be twice that of the pseudo “Central Trust Bureau” last year.
    The Qimen Tea Improvement Factory currently has 120 tea masters and 390 sorters. The People's Government is planning to expand the factory, increasing the number of tea masters to 200 and the number of sorters to 900. The wages of the workers in the factory are calculated in grain, thus their lives are guaranteed. Furthermore, with their political understanding and class consciousness awakened, their work enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. The tea farmers, benefiting from the high prices offered by the People's Government, and also receiving rations of salt and cloth at prices 20% to 40% lower than the market price, are all grateful for the People's Government's care and support for the workers and peasants.

    扶植祁门茶农
    设祁门茶叶产销合作社
    大量收购焙制
    【祁门讯】祁门这个古朴的山城，能够名闻中外，完全是由于它那驰名中外的特产——“祁红”。
    在国民党反动政府统治下，茶农受到无理的严重剥削，生产量每况愈下；今春茶季，国民党匪帮政府为着保有它奄奄一息的生命，更疯狂地征兵征粮，封锁交通，致使农民流浪异地，茶叶无人问津。
    四月二十六日我军解放祁门，人民政府成立以后，积极保护茶农利益，首先设立“祁门茶叶产销合作社”，大量收购茶叶。国营皖南贸易公司，在五月十七日，就派员到祁设立办事处，大量收购焙制。
    皖南贸易公司祁门办事处，为方便农民起见，特设立祁门、汉口、平里、乌溪口四个收茶处。在国民党反动政府统治下，往往以二十四、五两一斤的大秤剥削农民。解放后，则以买卖公平为原则，以十六两为一斤，于是四个收茶处的途中，茶农络绎不绝，门庭若市。自办事处成立，仅在短短的六周后，便收购了红绿毛茶三十二万八千七百二十斤。人民政府现正着手焙制精茶，今年计划要制成精茶六十余万斤。这样，产量是去年伪“中央信托局”的二倍。
    祁门茶叶改良厂，现有茶师百二十人，拣工三百九十人，人民政府正计划扩大厂务，茶师增至二百人，拣工增至九百人。厂内工人的薪津，都是以粮食计算，生活因而受到保障，更加上他（她）们又有了政治的认识和阶级的觉悟，工作情绪空前高涨。茶农田于人民政府的高价收购，而且还以食盐、布匹等低于市价百分之二十至四十的低价配售，无不感激人民政府对工农的爱护和扶助。
