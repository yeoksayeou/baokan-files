　　Hungarian Workers' Party Central Committee General Secretary Rakosi
　　The Information Bureau of several Communist Parties believes: "The Yugoslav leaders have overestimated the internal national strength and potential capabilities of Yugoslavia. They believe that Yugoslavia can maintain its independence and build socialism without the assistance of the world's Communist parties, the people's democratic countries, and the Soviet Union. They believe that New Yugoslavia can survive without the assistance of revolutionary forces." It has been almost a year since then.
　　The course of events shows that what we are talking about now is no longer a question of the Yugoslav leaders overestimating their strength or having wrong perceptions. In these eleven months, the Tito group has become one of the most active shock troops in the enemy camp of socialist construction and the international peace front. The Yugoslav leaders' hatred for socialist builders is more intense than that of the imperialists due to the base hearts of traitors and the infinite baseness and lack of principles that are characteristic of Trotskyites.
　　Last summer, after the Information Bureau's resolution was announced, the Yugoslav Trotskyites still said: this was a "misunderstanding," "incorrect information," and attempted to convince the Yugoslav working class that even if they severed relations with the people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union, they could still build socialism with their own strength.
　　Since then, the Titoists have abandoned these "theories" as unsuitable for practical application. Now, they are more openly reliant on Western imperialists. And they prove to their own working class that they "have to" rely on capitalists because the people's democratic countries "forced them into a state of isolation and helplessness." However, the workers of Yugoslavia immediately raised the question: why are those imperialists who are doing everything possible to oppose the socialist construction of the people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union suddenly so happy to listen to the instructions of the Tito "socialist" builders? Tito and his gang attempt to defend themselves by saying that the people's democratic countries also "have commercial ties with the imperialists." They only fail to mention that the strict principle that the imperialists adhere to when conducting this trade is that none of the goods they sell can strengthen the defense of the people's democratic countries that are genuinely building socialism. And the people's democratic countries have paid attention to this.
　　However, Yugoslavia sells important strategic materials, non-ferrous metals, etc., to the imperialists. Yugoslavia can obtain those materials and machines that are strictly prohibited from being exported to the people's democratic countries that are truly building socialism. In a May 1st communication from the "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post," it cited everything that Tito could purchase in the way of military supplies. Among them were 1,500 tons of alloy steel plates, 700 aircraft engines, and the like.
　　The changes that have occurred in Yugoslavia due to Tito's betrayal have also fundamentally changed the attitude of capitalist Western Europe. In the weeks after the Information Bureau's resolution was announced last summer, articles about "warnings" were frequently seen in the imperialist publications, saying that it was necessary to treat "Tito's tricks" with caution because this was a new trick of the Communist Party. They hoped to use this trick--"a wolf in sheep's clothing"--to secretly smuggle Yugoslavia into the capitalist sheepfold." Warnings like this have not been published for a long time. Replacing these warnings are more "instructions on how to utilize," the purpose of which is nothing more than how to prevent Tito from losing credibility in his own country as much as possible. The British capitalist newspaper "The Economist" wrote on March 26: "Every British or American attempt to help Tito overcome economic difficulties should be carefully considered from the point of view of maintaining Tito's resistance to the political forces aimed against him." And it added with a sigh: "Forming this correct view--is far from an easy task."
　　Therefore, it is no coincidence that the Yugoslav traitors adopted this attitude at the United Nations General Assembly. The imperialist accomplices who secretly instructed him, estimated that the Titoists would vote in line with the people's democratic countries on many issues. The imperialists knew that this would give him a hundredfold compensation, because Tito could confuse a part of the people in this way. Tito can say: "You see, we still belong to the socialist countries."
　　Of course, this is also not accidental, this common conspiracy, due to stupidity and clumsiness, revealed its true colors. Take what happened, for example, secret negotiations were held between Tito and the Greek fascist government. Yugoslavia is adjacent to four people's democratic countries. Of course, the Titoists were unwilling to have a fifth people's democratic country appear next to Yugoslavia due to the victory of the Greek freedom fighters. Therefore, they began secret negotiations with the Greek fascists. However, the Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris prematurely reported his hopes to the press, saying that he would soon be able to welcome Marshal Tito, the ally of the Kingdom of Greece. This disclosure made Tito very unhappy, and the "Daily News" on April 14 indignantly demanded "more methodical" treatment of Tito.
　　Such a small failure cannot change the collusion and cooperation between Tito's foreign policy and the imperialist "cold war" against socialism. For example, when the American imperialists thought it necessary to step up military hysteria, Tito used every means to join this military band: carrying out deception in Yugoslavia, mobilizing troops, etc.
　　The imperialists gleefully welcome Tito's cooperation, and the slanders against the people's democratic countries manufactured in Belgrade are spread thousands of times by the US and British radio stations and publications. Of course, the imperialists do not conceal their contempt for Tito among themselves. The American magazine "Newsweek" sarcastically wrote on April 25: "The chaste Tito is naked before his capitalist saviors." "The Economist," hoping to teach its readers a lesson, carefully analyzed the claims spread by Tito's gang: the industrial products sold by the Soviet Union to Yugoslavia were too expensive. It is difficult for Yugoslav workers to compare the price of food machines or lathes expressed in potatoes or corn with the prices on the world market. However, "The Economist" quoted this calculation and wrote in its April 16 issue this year: "These prices are not as high as Yugoslav propaganda claims. For example, saying 'a food machine requires 3,000 kilograms of corn' means that its price is less than 40 pounds, but the selling price of a food machine in the UK is about 65 pounds." The author ridiculed Tito's gang's "naive indignation," and pointed out straightforwardly, "What is doubtful is that the UK or the US would be so afraid of sacrificing themselves in order to help Yugoslavia's weak industry." "The Economist" has hinted more than once that the imperialists are now using Tito's situation to blackmail him; look, Yugoslavia is now repaying more of its old debts to the UK than the British had expected.
　　There are two reasons why the imperialists do not give Tito more open and extensive assistance. The first is that the betrayal of the Yugoslav leaders has gradually lost its value to the imperialists as the Yugoslav workers have begun to understand this betrayal. Second, they are unwilling to take this uncertain risk. In the case of China, the imperialists saw that most of the weapons they supplied to the Kuomintang army were transferred to the hands of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
　　The Western imperialists—are realists. They believe that Yugoslavia will sooner or later break away from the rule of the Tito group.
　　Therefore, the "assistance" given to Tito by the imperialists comes at a huge cost. The Yugoslav traitors must pay huge interest to the US and British imperialists for the loans they receive, pledge the Yugoslav gold stored in the US and Britain as collateral for debts, and the Titoists must spend strategic raw materials in exchange for military equipment.

### 南斯拉夫的托洛茨基分子是帝国主义的突击队

    南斯拉夫的托洛茨基分子是帝国主义的突击队
    匈工人党中央委员会总书记  拉科西
    几国共产党情报局认为：“南共领导者过高估计了南斯拉夫内部的民族力量及潜在能力。他们以为没有全世界共产党的援助，没有人民民主国家的援助，没有苏联底援助，就可以保持得住南斯拉夫底独立，就可以建成社会主义。他们以为没有革命力量底援助，新南斯拉夫也可以生存下去”，自从那时起快一年了。
    事件的过程表明了，现在所要谈的，已不是南斯拉夫领导者过高估计了力量，或者是错误的认识的问题。在这十一个月以来，铁托集团已成了社会主义建设和国际和平战线的敌对阵营中最积极的突击队之一。南斯拉夫领导者对社会主义建设者的憎恨，由于出卖者的卑劣心肝和托洛茨基分子所特有的无限卑鄙和无原则性，比帝国主义分子对社会主义建设的憎恨更厉害。
    去年夏天，情报局决议公布之后，南斯拉夫的托洛茨基分子还说：这是“误解”，“不正确的情报”，并且企图要南斯拉夫工人阶级确信，虽然他们与人民民主国家和苏联断绝关系，仍然可以用自己的力量建设社会主义。
    自那时起，铁托分子已把这些“理论”因不适于实际应用而抛弃了。现在，他们更加公开地依赖西方帝国主义者了。而他们向本国工人阶级证明说：他们“不得不”依靠资本主义分子，因为人民民主国家“迫使他们陷于孤立无援的地位”。然而，南斯拉夫的工人一开始便提出了问题：为什么那些竭力反对人民民主国家和苏联的社会主义建设的帝国主义者，忽然这样乐于听从铁托“社会主义”建设者的指使呢？铁托及其党徒们说，人民民主国家也“与帝国主义者有商业联系”，企图借此替自己辩护。他们唯独不讲那一点，即帝国主义者做这种贸易时所严格遵守的原则是，在他们售出的商品中没有能够加强人民民主国家国防的东西。而人民民主国家却注意到了这一点。
    可是，南斯拉夫售给帝国主义者，首先是重要的战略物资，有色金属等。南斯拉夫可以获得严厉禁止输往真正在建设着社会主义的人民民主国家的那些材料和机器。在五月一日“每日电讯与晨邮报”的通讯中，曾例举了铁托可以购到的一切军事物资。其中有一、五○○吨合金钢板、七百个飞机引擎等类的东西。
    由于铁托的出卖而在南斯拉夫所产生的那些变化，也根本改变了资本主义西欧的态度。在去年夏天，情报局决议公布之后的几个星期里，在帝国主义的刊物上时常可以看到关于“警告”一类的文章，说需要慎重对待“铁托所玩的花样，因为这是一种共产党的新把戏。他们希望借助这种把戏——‘狼披上绵羊皮’，以秘密输入的方法使南斯拉夫混进资本主义的羊圈”。象这类的警告很久就不发表了。代替这些警告而出现的是，更多的“关于利用方法的指示”，这些指示的目的，无非是如何尽可能使铁托在本国不立刻失掉信用。英国资本家机关报“经济学家”三月二十六日写道：“每一个英国或美国帮助铁托克服经济困难的尝试，都应从保持铁托对旨在反对他的政治力量的反抗力这一观点来慎重考虑的”。并且感叹地补充说：“形成这种正确的见解——远不是一件容易的事情”。
    因此，南斯拉夫的出卖者在联合国大会上所采取的态度不是无缘无故的。暗中指示的同谋者帝国主义分子估计到，铁托分子在许多问题都要与人民民主国家投一致票的。帝国主义者知道，这会使他得到百倍的补偿，因为铁托这样可以迷惑一部分人民。铁托可以说：“你们看，我们毕竟是属于社会主义国家”。
    当然，这也不是偶然的，这种共同的阴谋，由于愚蠢和笨拙而露出了马脚，就拿这发生过的事情来说吧，铁托与希腊法西斯政府之间曾举行过秘密谈判。南斯拉夫与四个人民民主国家毗邻相接，当然，铁托分子不愿意，因希腊自由战士的胜利，而在南斯拉夫旁边再出现第五个人民民主国家。因此，他们与希腊法西斯分子开始了秘密谈判。可是雅典的外交部长曹达利斯向新闻界过早地报导了自己的希望，说他很快即能欢迎希腊王国的同盟者铁托元帅。这一披露使铁托十分不愉快，而四月十四日的“每日新闻”愤慨地要求“要更有步骤地”来对待铁托。
    这样微小的失败，并不能改变铁托对外政策和帝国主义反对社会主义的“冷仗”内中勾结和互相配合。比方说，当美国帝国主义分子认为需要加强军事的歇斯底里的时候，铁托便用尽一切手段来参加这个军乐队：在南斯拉夫进行欺骗，调动军队等等。
    帝国主义者兴高彩烈地欢迎着铁托的合作，而在贝尔格莱德所制造的反对人民民主国家的诽谤，由美英的广播电台、出版物千百次地传布着。当然，帝国主义者在自己人中间并不掩饰对铁托的鄙视。四月二十五日美国杂志“新闻周报”讽刺地写道：“守贞操的铁托在其资本主义拯救者面前裸体”。“经济学家”在希望给自己的读者上一堂课的时候，曾详细分析了铁托党徒们所散播的说法：苏联售给南斯拉夫的工业品太贵。南斯拉夫工人很难拿以土豆子或苞米所表示的食品机器或镟床的价格来与世界市场上的价格相比。但是，“经济学家”引用了这计算，并在今年四月十六日这一期上写道：“这些价格还不如南斯拉夫宣传的那样高。例如，说‘一部食品机器需要付以三千公斤苞米’，这就是说，其价格尚不到四十英镑，可是在英国食品机器的售价大约是六十五英镑”。该文作者嘲笑地写道，这是铁托分子“天真的愤慨”，并且直率指出，“令人怀疑的倒是英国或美国为了帮助南斯拉夫的弱小工业，而竟不怕牺牲”。“经济学家”不只一次地暗示说，帝国主义者现正用铁托的处境，来敲诈他；试看，南斯拉夫现时偿还英国旧债数目，比英国人所预料的还要多得多。
    至于帝国主义不给铁托更公开和广泛的援助，有两个原因。第一个就是，南斯拉夫领导者的叛变，对帝国主义者说来，由于南斯拉夫工人已开始明白了这种出卖而逐渐失去其价值。第二、不愿意做这种没有把握的冒险。在中国的例子上，帝国主义者看到了，他们供给国民党军的大部分武器都转到中国人民解放军的手里。
    西方的帝国主义者——是现实主义者。他们认为南斯拉夫早晚会摆脱铁托集团的统治。
    因此，帝国主义者给予铁托的“援助”是要付以巨大代价的。南斯拉夫出卖者对所获之贷款，必须给予美英帝国主义者以巨大利息，把贮存在美英的南斯拉夫的黄金作债务的抵押，铁托分子须支出战略的原料以换取军事设备。（未完）
