  　Tangshan Factory and Mine Workers Bravely Rescue Machinery
    [Tangshan News] On the 13th, Tangshan City experienced torrential rain all day, and the water level of the Steppe River in the suburbs rose sharply, reaching a level unseen in fifty years. Following the flooding on the 11th, the river water once again overflowed its banks, breaching all flood control structures. The North China Electric Power Tangshan Power Plant, Tangshan Steel Plant, and Huaxin Textile Factory, all located near the riverbank in the urban area, were inundated. The eastern low-lying areas of the city's six districts were also flooded. The water depth in Culture Street and East Prosperity Street was over two feet; the water depth in Big Red Bridge Street and the suburban vegetable gardens, Huayang Paper Mill, and other places was over the top of people's heads, and most of the houses collapsed. The first and fourth districts were also flooded. During the flooding period, the factory and mine workers cooperated fully, braved the rain to rescue machinery, and transported and rescued affected families, fully demonstrating the spirit of friendship and unity of the working class. The workers of Huaxin Textile Factory organized two shifts of shock brigades to carry out factory protection and rescue work; more than 120 coal miners, workers' militia, and mine police from the Kailuan Tangshan Mine rushed to the affected factories to assist in rescuing equipment and materials. The Tangshan City Flood Control Headquarters actively organized forces to transport affected people out of the flooded areas and carry out relief work.
