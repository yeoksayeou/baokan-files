　　Xinxiang Telegram: The Pingyuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government, and the Pingyuan Military Region held an inaugural meeting in Xinxiang at 3:00 PM on August 20th. Attendees included representatives from the Party, government, military, and various circles of Pingyuan Province and Xinxiang City, totaling over 5,000 people. After Comrade Zhang Chengxian of the CPC Pingyuan Provincial Committee delivered the opening remarks, Comrade Pan Fusheng, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, delivered a speech. He first pointed out the following five major characteristics of Pingyuan Province:

　　(1) It is composed of Luxi in Shandong, Yubei in Henan, and Jinnan in Hebei, but it is located at the junction of five provinces (Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, Shanxi, and Hebei), with particularly strong feudal characteristics. The establishment of a new unified provincial unit is of great significance for mobilizing the masses to eliminate feudalism and carry out construction. (2) It is entirely a large plain, a large warehouse, producing large quantities of grain, cotton, and peanuts. It is of great significance in supplying grain and industrial raw materials to cities. Furthermore, the Xinxiang and Anyang special districts contain abundant resources such as coal and iron, providing conditions for industrial development. (3) The Yellow River traverses the entire province, and the "tofu waist" of the Yellow River is precisely in Pingyuan Province. Before fundamental solutions can be found, it is entirely a harmful river. The current urgent task is to strengthen river management and flood control to ensure that it does not breach, which is a arduous task. At the same time, we must begin to study fundamental solutions to turn the harmful river into a beneficial river. (4) Xinxiang and Anyang were the last places to be liberated in North China. After three years of the Liberation War, the Kuomintang systematically planned underground sabotage work in the Huxi and Heze special districts. Although special agents, bandits, and the remaining armed forces of the enemy have been severely打击ed through our military suppression and political disintegration after liberation, they have not been completely eliminated and still retain considerable strength, which should not be ignored. (5) It is a historical battlefield. After eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and three years of the Liberation War, the devastation and destruction by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang have left the people in this area living in poverty. Based on the above regional characteristics and actual conditions, Comrade Pan Fusheng proposed the following five major tasks for Pingyuan Province in the future: First, develop production. Because industry accounts for a very small proportion of the province, developing agricultural production is the focus of the province's production development. Only by developing agricultural production and accumulating capital can we create conditions for the development of industrial production. Of course, industry and handicrafts cannot be ignored, and considerable efforts must be made to restore and develop them. To develop agricultural production, we must deeply understand the difficulties of farmers, organize and mobilize the masses well, implement mutual aid and cooperation, build water conservancy projects, prevent drought and control floods, practice thrift, and issue agricultural loans. At the same time, we must pay attention to developing culture and education, improving the cultural level and production knowledge of the masses, and carry out health campaigns to maintain a healthy labor force. Second, because one-third of Pingyuan Province is still a newly liberated area and part is a recovery area, we must complete land reform this winter and next spring to eliminate the feudal system. Third, increase vigilance, eliminate bandits and special agents, consolidate revolutionary order, and defend production and construction. This is the historical task of the people of Pingyuan. Fourth, manage the Yellow River well. First of all, it is necessary to ensure that it does not breach, which is a major task for all Party members, government officials, soldiers, and civilians; and we must begin to survey and study fundamental solutions to achieve the goal of utilizing the Yellow River for irrigation and navigation in the future, turning the harmful river into a beneficial river. Fifth, in order to complete the above tasks, Comrade Pan Fusheng finally pointed out: we must improve the level of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in the Pingyuan Party, strengthen Party building, strengthen learning, and strengthen the unity of the entire Party. Only in this way can we ensure the correct implementation of the Party's line and policies, and ensure the completion of the great tasks assigned by the Party.

　　新乡各界五千人举行盛会
  　庆祝平原省成立
    省委书记潘复生说明建省特点提出发展农业生产等五大任务
    【新乡电】中国共产党平原省委员会、平原省人民政府、平原军区于八月二十日午后三时在新乡举行成立大会。到会者有平原省与新乡市党、政、军及各界代表共约五千余人。中共平原省委张承先同志致开会词后，即由省委书记潘复生同志讲话，他首先指出平原省有以下五大特点：
    （一）是由山东的鲁西、河南的豫北、河北的冀南组成，但是处于五省（山东、江苏、河南、山西、河北）的结合部，封建性特大，成立新的统一的省单位，对发动群众消灭封建，进行建设有重大意义。（二）完全是一个大平原，是一个大仓库，出产大批粮食、棉花和花生，在供给城市粮食与工业原料上意义极大，并且在新乡、安阳两专区，蕴藏煤铁等丰富资源，有发展工业条件。（三）黄河横贯全省，且黄河的“豆腐腰”恰在平原省，在未能治本前，完全是害河，目前加强治河防汛，保证不开口，是艰巨的任务，同时着手研究变害河为利河的治本方案。（四）新乡、安阳是华北解放最晚的地方，湖西、荷泽两专区，经三年解放战争，国民党曾有计划的布置了地下破坏工作。特务匪徒、敌人残余武装力量，经过我们在解放后的军事清剿与政治瓦解，虽受到严重打击，但尚未完全肃清，还保有相当力量，不容忽视。（五）是历史上的战场。经过八年抗日战争、三年解放战争，日寇和国民党的摧残破坏，已使这块地区人民生活处于贫困的状态。从以上地区特点与实际情况出发，潘复生同志提出今后平原省的五大任务：第一、发展生产。因为工业在全省占的比重极小，所以发展农业生产是全省发展生产的重点。只有发展农业生产，积累资本，方能为发展工业生产创造条件。当然对工业和手工业也不能忽视，也要拿出相当力量来恢复与发展。要发展农业生产，必须深入了解农民的困难，要好好组织与发动群众，实行互助合作，兴修水利，防旱治涝，实行节约，发放农贷。同时，必须注意发展文化教育，提高群众文化水平和生产知识，开展卫生运动，保持健康的劳动力。第二、因平原省仍有三分之一的新区及一部恢复区，今冬明春必须完成土地改革，消灭封建制度。第三、提高警惕性，肃清匪特，巩固革命秩序，保卫生产建设，这是平原人民的历史任务。第四、治好黄河。首先要保证不开口，这是全体党、政、军、民的重大任务；并且要开始勘察与研究治本的办法，以达到将来能利用黄河灌溉与航运，变害河为利河的目的。第五、为完成以上的任务，潘复生同志最后指出：必须提高平原党马列主义、毛泽东思想水平，加强党的建设，加强学习，加强全党团结，这样才能保证正确执行党的路线和政策，才能保证完成党给的伟大任务。
