    From the Baoding Telegram: The Tangshan area has suffered a typhoon and tidal wave disaster, and the local Party committee is actively studying rescue measures. The entire area experienced strong winds for three days starting on July 29th. The coastal and Great Wall line areas were particularly severely affected. Sorghum was flattened, with an estimated reduction in yield of about 50% compared to normal. In Lulong and Funing counties, 20% to 30% of cotton bolls were blown off. In Luan County, Qian'an, Linyu and other counties, approximately 60% to 80% of the fruit on fruit trees was blown off. Millet grains were damaged by the wind, with general losses of about 50% to 70%. Meanwhile, due to continuous strong winds and rain in the Tangshan area, the water levels of major and minor rivers rose sharply. On the 26th, the Luan River breached its banks in three places. On the 27th, the Jiyun River breached its banks downstream of Xiacang in the 12th district of Yutian, extending over 200 zhang (approximately 667 meters), flooding more than 230 villages and approximately 300,000 mu (approximately 20,000 hectares) of farmland. Furthermore, due to the impact of the typhoon on the sea, a tidal wave occurred, washing away five-sixths of the salt from the Daqing River salt滩(tan, means beach or flats). Fourteen villages along the coast in the 4th district of Changli were flooded by the tidal wave. Upon hearing of the disasters, the Special Commissioner's Office, Vice Special Commissioner Wu Yushan rushed to Changli to inspect the flood situation and dispatched 30 cadres from the Armed Forces Department and other agencies to the disaster area of Yutian on the 30th to organize the masses to rush to plug the breach in the rain. At the same time, the local Party committee also convened experienced farmers to study rescue measures in order to organize the masses for rescue.

    Also, after heavy rain on the night of July 24th, the water levels of various rivers in the Tong County area rose sharply, and many places were already overflowing. The North Canal was nearly full, and in some places, it had overflowed. The Jiyun River breached its banks at the Luotuo Port bridgehead downstream in one place. The Zhang River within Jixian County had overflowed in many places. Cadres of various river flood control agencies immediately organized the masses to plug the breaches and protect the dikes. In the 4th district of Sanhe County, over 10,000 people had been mobilized to protect the Wu River embankments and had repaired two dangerous dikes. Over 2,000 people are currently rushing to repair the dangerous dikes on the North Canal. After the breach at Laogaozhai in Baodi on the Jiyun River on the 19th, over 3,000 people were mobilized to rush to repair it overnight.

    From the Baoding Telegram: Due to the typhoon and tidal wave in the Tangshan area, the Tangshan Prefectural Party Committee, the Special Commissioner's Office, and the Changli County Party Committee jointly convened a symposium on the first of this month with 25 labor models and experienced farmers from the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 7th Chenxiang districts of Changli to discuss post-disaster rescue measures: 1. It is necessary to first restore the morale of the masses for production, and lead the masses to intensify production, apply more fertilizer, cultivate more land, develop autumn plowing, and select seeds to overcome all difficulties, defeat the famine, and lay the foundation for large-scale production next year. 2. Rescue measures: (1) Open canals to drain water. There is a lot of standing water in the low-lying areas after the rain, and it cannot recede in recent days. Old channels should be used to open canals to divert water into rivers to reduce waterlogging of crops. (2) Intensive cultivation. Crops that have not been damaged or have suffered minor damage should be hoed one more time and more fertilizer should be applied to ensure that the grains are full and produce more food. (3) Support crops. After the rain, the sorghum leaves are pressed down by silt and are not easy to straighten up. The existing waterlogged land can be used to wash away the silt, and the dry land can be used to cut off the muddy leaves. (4) For crops that have died, buckwheat should be replanted immediately or cabbage and other vegetables should be planted. 3. Conserve and prepare for famine. This year, production has generally decreased, and to prevent famine next spring, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to tighten their belts and develop sideline production, reclaim wasteland, and plant more vegetables, wheat, and other early-maturing crops to prepare for weathering the famine.

    唐山至山海关一带
    台风海啸成灾
    政府正积极领导人民救灾抢险
    【保定电】唐山专区因台风海啸成灾，地委正积极研究抢救中。自七月二十九日起全区大风三天。沿海沿长城线受害尤为严重，高粱都被刮倒，按常年产量约减产百分之五十上下，卢龙、抚宁两县，棉桃被刮落百分之二十到百分之三十，滦县、迁安、临榆等县果树果子，被刮掉约百分之六十到百分之八十，谷子粒泡被磨破，一般损失约百分之五十至七十。同时唐山地区各地因连日大风雨，大小河流水位突涨，二十六日滦河三处决口，二十七日蓟运河中游玉田十二区下仓以南决口，长达二百余丈，水淹二百三十余村，约三十万亩田地。又因海水受台风影响发生河啸，大清河盐滩之盐被冲去六分之五，昌黎四区沿海十四村因河啸被淹。以上灾害，专署闻讯后，吴玉山副专员赶赴昌黎检查水灾情况，并抽武装部等机关干部三十名，于三十日冒雨赴玉田灾区组织群众抢堵决口，同时地委并召集有经验的农民研究抢救办法，以便组织群众抢救。
    又，七月二十四日夜大雨后，通县专区各河水势暴涨，多处已在泛滥。北运河水已将满槽，有的地方也已外溢。蓟运河下游骆驼港桥头决口一处。蓟县境内之障河水，已多处外溢。各河防汛机关干部，立即分头组织群众进行堵口护堤。三河县四区已动员万余群众防护午河堤埝；并已修好险堤两处。北运河险堤，现有两千余人正在抢修。蓟运河宝坻老高寨处十九日决口后，已动员三千余人连夜抢修。
    【保定电】唐山专区因台风海啸影响成灾，本月一日，唐山地委、专署及昌黎县委联合召集昌黎一、二、四、七城厢等五个区劳动模范及有经验的农民共二十五人开座谈会，研讨灾后抢救办法：一、必须首先恢复群众生产情绪，领导群众更要加紧生产，多压肥，多锄地，开展秋垡地，选种等工作，克服一切困难，战胜灾荒，打下明年大生产基础。二、抢救办法：（一）开渠泄水。雨后洼地存水很多，近日不能退出，应利用老道开渠引水入河，使农作物减免水涝。（二）精耕细作。没有损失或损失较轻的农作物，保证多锄一遍，多追肥，使籽粒长得饱满，多打粮食。（三）扶植作物。雨后高粱叶被淤泥压住，不易直起，现有水地可用水冲去淤泥，干地可把泥叶剪去。（四）已死去的农作物，要立即补种荞麦或栽种白菜等。三、节约备荒。今年普遍减产，要防止明春粮荒，就须动员群众节衣缩食，并开展副业生产，开垦荒地，多种菜蔬、麦子及其他早熟作物，准备渡荒。
