Cadres Wade Through Water to Inspect Waterways
    Persuade the Masses to Dig Ditches for Drainage
    Fifteen Districts Rescue Over a Thousand Mu of Seedlings

[Report from this newspaper] After the heavy rains from July 28th to 31st in the fifteenth district of this city, from Lugouqiao and Fengtai to Guang'anmen, some houses collapsed in villages and towns, and many crops were flooded. Especially in the areas of Yujia Hutong, Jiji Miao, Xiajia Hutong, Wanquansi, Caihuying, Efangying, Caoqiao, and Huangtugang, the waterlogged area in drylands, gardens reached one to three feet, with a flooded area of more than a thousand mu. Under the mobilization and leadership of the district work team, ditches were opened for drainage. In Wanquansi and Yujia Hutong two administrative villages mobilized 540 people within two days, spending a total of 20 hours, digging ditches for drainage, and opening a six-li long, two-chi wide, and three-chi deep drainage ditch, rescuing a total of 1,060 mu of crops. After the drainage, the water in the fields receded three days earlier, preserving at least 30% of the harvest.

    On the morning of the 31st, after the rain stopped, the masses gathered in groups of three or five, discussing the flood, saying, "It's over, it's over." The work team stopped the morning study session and held an emergency meeting. They divided up and, in coordination with the village cadres, waded through knee-deep water to inspect the fields, observe the drainage routes, listen to the opinions of the masses, and decided to start from the west entrance of Yujia Hutong, follow the road to the railway to Caoqiao, and from the east entrance of Yujia Hutong, go northeast to the railway and also converge at Caoqiao, opening ditches to let the water flow eastward. In addition, they deepened the drainage ditch south of Fanjiacun and dredged the obstacles in the Zheng Wangfen ditch to drain the accumulated water.

    During the work, village cadres and the masses had concerns. After repeated explanations by the work team, clarifying that there would be great losses to the crops if the water was not drained, and explaining the drainage methods in detail, the village cadres and the masses were mobilized. Utilizing the organizational foundation of the flood-fighting team during the previous month's flood prevention, almost all men aged 18 to 55 participated. In Fanjiacun alone, more than 300 people were organized within three hours. Residents in the Efangying area, fearing that the water would damage the roads, surrounded the water with trenches, leaving only one outlet, so the water could not flow out. After explaining "Crops first, roads second," less than a hundred people were mobilized by the administrative village, and the trenches were dug through, and the water flowed away overnight. A wealthy farmer named Kang in Wanquansi, because the ditch would affect a few fen of his land, did not allow people to dig on his land. After education and persuasion, the two-li-long ditch dug by more than 40 people in the village was also successfully completed.

    Before the rain and after the flooding, the general public said: "This year's harvest is over, there is really no way, the price of food has risen, and there are no crops." This time, when the work team called for digging ditches, they were not very confident. After the drainage, Yujia Hutong village reported: "The method you came up with is good, you are really doing things for us. In previous years, when it rained heavily, there were many fights, and drainage and blocking were all for oneself. This year, there were no fights, and people from the villages in the west even came to help us." Zhao Chenggui from the village happily said: "Before the drainage, only the tip of the beans in the field was left, and after drainage, more than half of them were exposed overnight." Villagers in Jiji Miao said: "This drainage method is very effective!" Farmers in Efangying and Wanquansi said that if the water had remained for another day, the millet would have been ruined, thanks to this ditch digging and the earlier cutting of reeds in the river to clear the waterway." With these achievements, the village cadres' previous concerns about being unwilling to do it, fearing that digging ditches would offend people, were also eliminated.

    干部涉水察看水路
    说服群众挖沟放水
    十五区救出青苗千余亩
    【本报讯】本市郊十五区在七月二十八至三十一日大雨后，由芦沟桥、丰台至广安门一带，村镇房屋倒塌一部，庄稼被淹的很多，尤其在于家胡同、纪家庙、夏家胡同、万泉寺、菜户营、鹅房营、草桥、黄土岗一带，水、旱、园地积水一尺至三尺，被淹面积达千亩以上。经区工作组动员领导，开沟泄水，在万泉寺和于家胡同两行政村两天内动员群众五百四十人，共用去二十小时的时间，挖渠放水，并开了一道长六里、宽二尺、深三尺的泄水沟，救出庄稼共一千零六十亩。放水后，田里积水提前落下三天，保住了至少三成年景。
    三十一日晨雨住后，群众三五成群，议论着大水，都说：“完了，完了。”工作组停止了当天清晨的学习，召开紧急会议，分头配合村干部踏着没膝的深水到田间巡视，察看泄水路线，听取群众意见，决定从于家胡同西口起顺大道至铁道到草桥，另由于家胡同村东口，经东北至铁道也归到草桥，开沟使水东流，另又挖深樊家村南的泄水沟，疏浚郑王坟沟内障碍，使积水宣泄。
    工作进行时，村干部和群众都有顾虑，经工作组再三解释，说明不放水庄稼有很大损失，并详细说明放水的办法后，村干部和群众动员起来，利用上月防汛时抢险大队的组织基础，差不多所有十八岁到五十五岁的男子都参加了，仅樊家村一地在三小时内就组织了三百余人，鹅房营一带居民为了怕水冲坏了道，把水用壕围起，只留一个出水口，水流不出去，经说明“庄稼第一，道第二”，到行政村动员了不到一百人，挖通壕沟，水一夜就流完了。万泉寺一个康姓富农，因为开沟要动他几分地，不叫人从他地边开，经过教育说服后，该村四十余人所开二里长的沟也顺利完成了。
    雨前和淹水后，一般群众都说：“今年的年成完了，真没法，粮食涨了又没有庄稼。”这次工作组号召开沟，他们还不大有信心。到放水以后，于家胡同村反映：“你们想的办法好，真是替咱们办事。往年下了大雨，打架的就多了，放水堵水都是为自己，今年这么办，没人打架了，西边村的人还来帮助我们。”该村赵承贵高兴地说：“没放水前地里豆子剩了一个尖，放了隔一夜就落下去多半截。”纪家庙的老乡说：“这么样放水太管事啦！”鹅房营和万泉寺的农民都说水再晚下去一天，谷子就完了，多亏这次挖沟和先前早把河里的苇子割了，放出水路。”得到这些成绩，村干部先前不愿做，怕挖沟动土得罪人的顾虑也消除了。
