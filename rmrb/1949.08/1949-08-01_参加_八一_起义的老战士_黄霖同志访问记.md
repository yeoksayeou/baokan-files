    A Visit with Comrade Huang Lin, Veteran of the "August 1st" Uprising
    Lin Yao
    The reporter visited Comrade Huang Lin, a veteran revolutionary fighter who participated in the "August 1st" Uprising twenty-two years ago, in Nanchang City, the site of the uprising. He is currently the Secretary of the Nanchang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China.

    Standing before a map of China marked with red for the liberated areas, Comrade Huang Lin excitedly recounted the magnificent feat of the "August 1st" Uprising, saying, "It wasn't easy! The 'August 1st' Uprising was launched under extremely dangerous circumstances for the revolution, with imperialism and the reactionary ruling clique of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei uniting to attack the revolution, coupled with the erroneous leadership of Chen Duxiu's right-leaning opportunism within the Party. It was an earth-shattering act!" He said, "Around late July, the 20th Army led by General He Long, and the 4th and 11th Armies led by General Ye Ting, successively arrived in Nanchang from Wuhan, and joined forces with the Training Regiment led by Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Under the leadership of the Revolutionary Military Commission, at one o'clock in the morning on August 1st, machine guns rang out in Nanchang. At that time, I was in a company of He Long's troops; our company participated in attacking the headquarters of Zhu Peide's Third Army. The entire city, from the start of the offensive to the end of the battle, took only three hours. All of Zhu Peide's counter-revolutionary troops were annihilated. The revolutionary red flag fluttered in the sky above Nanchang."

    He paused for a moment, gently stroking his forehead as he recalled, "At that time, we attacked the headquarters of the Third Army. The enemy put up a resolute resistance, the machine guns fired fiercely, and many comrades sacrificed themselves under the intense artillery fire, but everyone still bravely charged forward." He became agitated and said, "The revolutionary will of the people's army, from day one, was so firm. This is such a valuable quality!"

    On the second day of the uprising, shops opened as usual. Revolutionary slogans like "Down with imperialism! Down with old and new warlords! Down with the counter-revolutionary Chiang Kai-shek! Implement land to the tiller!" invigorated the hearts of every soldier and civilian in Nanchang. Then, raising his voice and with a radiant expression, he said, "At that time, the uprising troops numbered about 30,000. Think about it, in the twenty-two years since then, the people's army has grown more than a hundredfold!" In the lamplight, his face was full of joy.

    Comrade Huang Lin concluded by talking about the great spirit of resolute struggle of the leaders of the "August 1st" Uprising, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and Generals He Long and Ye Ting. He said: When the uprising troops encountered setbacks after leaving Nanchang and marching towards Dongjiang, a small number of comrades wavered in the face of difficult circumstances. At this time, Commander-in-Chief Zhu was active in the Sanheba area of Guangdong. Upon hearing the news, he immediately addressed the troops in Sanheba, encouraging and strengthening the morale of the troops. Commander-in-Chief Zhu said: "Comrades: We must persevere to the end in any difficulties, even in failure, and must not waver in any way. As long as we unite closely, we can defeat all enemies." In the twenty-two years since then, this army, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, has overcome all difficulties and all enemies, and has now developed into a large army of four million with excellent equipment. Today, as we commemorate "August 1st," we should learn well the great and strong fighting spirit of the "August 1st" Uprising. (Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 31st)

    参加“八一”起义的老战士
    黄霖同志访问记
    林耀
    记者在“八一”起义的地点——南昌市，访问了二十二年前参加起义的革命老战士黄霖同志，他现在是中共南昌市委会书记。
    在一幅用红色标志着解放区的中国地图前，黄霖同志兴奋地叙述“八一”起义的壮举时说：“不容易啊！‘八一’起义是在帝国主义和蒋介石汪精卫反动统治集团联合起来向革命进攻，加上党内陈独秀右倾机会主义的错误领导，革命是处于这样危险万分的状况下举行的。这是一个惊天动地的举动！”他说：“那是在七月下旬的时候，贺龙将军领导的二十军，和叶挺将军领导的四军与十一军，陆续从武汉开到南昌，和朱总司令领导的教导团会师了。在革命军事委员会的领导下，八月一日早晨一点钟的时候，机关枪在南昌打响了。当时我在贺龙部队的一个连队里；我们这个连是参加打朱培德第三军军部的。全城从开始进攻到最后结束战斗，仅仅三小时。所有朱培德的反革命队伍全被消灭了。革命的红旗招展在南昌的上空。”
    他默想了片刻，左手轻轻抚着额角回忆着：“那时我们攻打三军军部。敌人曾进行了坚决的抵抗，机关枪打得很猛，不少同志在密集的炮火下牺牲了，但大家仍奋勇地向前冲锋。”他变得激动地说：“人民军队的革命意志从第一天起，就是那么坚决。这是多么可贵的品质！”
    起义的第二天，商店照常营业，“打倒帝国主义！打倒新旧军阀！打倒反革命的蒋介石！实行耕者有其田！”的革命口号，振奋着南昌每个军民的心。接着，他提高嗓子神彩焕发地说：“当时起义的部队约三万人左右，想想看，二十二年来，人民军队发展了一百多倍！”灯光下，他的脸上露出满面的喜悦。
    黄霖同志最后谈到“八一”起义的领导者，朱德总司令和贺龙将军叶挺军长等的坚决斗争的伟大精神。他说：当起义部队离开南昌向东江进军受到挫折后，少数同志在困难环境下动摇了。这时，朱总司令正在广东三河坝一带活动，听到消息后，马上向三河坝的部队讲话，鼓舞和坚定部队的斗志。朱总司令说：“同志们：我们在任何困难，甚至失败的情况下，也要坚决干到底，不能有任何动摇，我们只要紧紧地团结起来，就可以战胜一切敌人。”二十二年来这支军队就在毛主席、朱总司令领导下，战胜了一切困难和一切敌人，现在发展成四百万装备优良的大军了，我们今天来纪念“八一”，就应该很好地学习“八一”起义伟大坚强的斗争精神。（新华社南昌三十一日电）
