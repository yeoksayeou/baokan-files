“August 1st” – is the anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army has been around for twenty-two years since its inception on August 1, 1927. During these twenty-two years, this armed force of the Chinese people, through the Agrarian Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the People's Liberation War, has grown stronger under extremely difficult conditions, and finally defeated Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the running dogs of American imperialism, two powerful armed enemies, and achieved the great victory of liberating the whole country. Now people can clearly see that the establishment and development of the people's armed forces is the decisive factor for the liberation of the Chinese people.

In the spring and summer of 1927, when the Northern Expeditionary War was continuing to advance victoriously, the Kuomintang reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, colluded with imperialism and feudal forces in order to prevent the complete victory of the revolution and seize the fruits of the revolutionary victory, betrayed the revolution, and launched a bloody massacre of the Chinese people on "April 12th." However, the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party at that time, represented by Chen Duxiu, adopted a shameful policy of surrender towards the bourgeois counter-revolutionary groups of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, opposed the peasant revolution, refused to arm the workers and peasants, and even disarmed the existing workers and peasants' armed forces, thus facilitating the attacks of the Chiang and Wang counter-revolutionaries. The first Chinese revolution from 1925 to 1927 suffered a great setback. Under such circumstances, the Chinese Communist Party, under the leadership of comrades Mao Zedong and Zhu De, opposed Chen Duxiu's right-leaning opportunism, continued to hold high the banner of the Chinese revolution, resolutely supported the peasant revolution, and carried out armed uprisings. On August 1, 1927, comrades Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, He Long, Ye Ting and others first launched an armed uprising in Nanchang, Jiangxi. The troops participating in the uprising included the Ninth Army led by Comrade Zhu De, the Twentieth Army led by Comrade He Long, and the Eleventh Army led by Comrade Ye Ting and part of the Fourth Army, totaling more than 30,000 people. From then on, a completely new army of the Chinese people was born under the independent leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. This was then called the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army during the Anti-Japanese War, and now the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

After the Nanchang Uprising, in mid-August, peasant armed uprisings took place in Puqi, Xianning, Chongyang and other places in Hubei. In September, the peasants of Hunan, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, launched the famous Autumn Harvest Armed Uprising, and once occupied important cities in eastern Hunan such as Pingjiang, Liuyang, Pingxiang, Liling, and Zhuzhou. The peasants of Hailufeng in Guangdong also launched an uprising in October, occupied cities such as Haifeng and Lufeng, and formed a Workers' and Peasants' Red Army of more than 10,000 people. At that time, the insurgent army withdrew from Nanchang on August 5 and headed for Guangdong, the source of the Northern Expeditionary Revolution, due to the disparity in strength between the enemy and ourselves. However, under the pressure of the superior forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and due to the lack of experience and errors in leadership at the time, the insurgent army suffered setbacks in Chaozhou and Shantou. Therefore, one part of the army transferred to Hailufeng to join forces with the uprising peasant armed forces, and the other part, under the leadership of Comrade Zhu De, retreated to Jiangxi, turned to Hunan, and launched the Xiangnan Peasant Uprising. Then, in the Jinggang Mountain area, namely Ninggang, Yongxin, Suichuan, Chaling, Lingxian, and other counties on the border between Hunan and Jiangxi, it joined forces with the First Division of the First Army of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army led by Comrade Mao Zedong, which was composed of uprising peasants from Hunan, and established the Fourth Red Army.

The "August 1st" Uprising was the beginning of the independent creation of the people's armed forces by the Chinese Communist Party, and it also marked a new stage in the Chinese people's revolution, opening up new paths for the hope of the Chinese people. Chairman Mao said in November 1938 in "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War" when discussing the war history of the Chinese Communist Party: "The failure of the revolution brought painful lessons, and then there were the Nanchang Uprising, the Autumn Harvest Uprising, and the Guangzhou Uprising, entering a new period of creating the Red Army. This period was an extremely important period for our Party to thoroughly understand the importance of the army. Without the Red Army and its war in this period, that is to say, if the Communist Party had adopted Chen Duxiu's liquidationism, the long-term War of Resistance Against Japan today would have been unimaginable."

The most critical significance in the history of the creation of this great People's Liberation Army was the joining of forces in Jinggang Mountain. The Nanchang Uprising troops were the revolutionary backbone of the National Revolutionary Army in the Great Revolution era, and they inherited the most outstanding traditions created by the Communist Party in the Great Revolution era. The combination of this uprising force with the revolutionary armed forces formed directly from the mass movement under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong enabled the armed forces of these two to be combined into one under the direct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, and gradually created an army that was the closest to the people in history. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, this army of the Chinese people quickly formed its own flexible strategies and tactics, and established a complete set of military building ideas, a complete set of military building principles, and a complete set of military building systems under the leadership of the proletariat. These ideas, principles, and systems are recorded in the famous Resolution of the Ninth Congress of the Fourth Army of the Chinese Communist Red Army. The basic content of these ideas and principles is still fully applicable today. It is precisely because this armed force of the Chinese people has followed Comrade Mao Zedong's military thought, military policies, and military line from the day it was established, constantly overcame various erroneous tendencies, and overcome serious setbacks, that it has been able to win the support of the broad masses of the people, overcome all difficulties, grow from small to large, from weak to strong, and become an invincible force over the past twenty-two years.

Since the "August 1st" Uprising, in the ten-year Agrarian Revolutionary War, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army had successively established more than a dozen large revolutionary base areas in Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, Guangdong, Hubei, Anhui, Henan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia and other provinces, and developed into a powerful people's armed force of 300,000 people, repeatedly crushing the "encirclement and suppression" of the Kuomintang reactionaries' million-strong army with the assistance of imperialism. Only in one period did it suffer serious setbacks because the erroneous line violated the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, but because of Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership, the main force of the Red Army successfully completed the 25,000-li Long March and entered the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the forward position for resisting Japan. After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was reorganized into the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, becoming the backbone force for China's persistence in the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, under the attack of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries, it resisted 64% of the invading Japanese army and 95% of the puppet troops, killed, wounded, and captured more than 1.7 million enemy and puppet troops, developed 930,000 regular troops and 2.2 million militiamen, and created liberated areas spanning 19 provinces and with a population of 99.5 million, ensuring the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the three-year Liberation War, the Chinese People's Liberation Army defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries aided by American imperialism, and has so far annihilated 5.69 million enemy troops, and developed itself into a powerful force of 4 million troops; liberated 17 entire provinces and 143.3 million Chinese people, expanding the population of the entire liberated area to 279.9 million. Now it is about to liberate all of China.

The twenty-two-year history of the People's Liberation Army proves that as long as we adhere to the correct political line and military line, maintain the working style of hard struggle, and completely integrate with the masses of the people, any powerful enemy can be overthrown, and any serious difficulties can be overcome.

    “八一”建军节介绍
    “八一”——是中国人民解放军诞生的纪念日。人民解放军从一九二七年八月一日产生到现在已经二十二年了。在这二十二年中，这支中国人民的武装，经过土地革命战争、抗日战争和人民解放战争，在极端困难的条件下，发展壮大起来，终于战胜了日本帝国主义和美帝国主义走狗国民党反动派这二个强大的武装的敌人，取得了目前即将解放全国的伟大胜利。现在人们都清楚地看到：人民武装的建立与发展，乃是中国人民获得解放的决定因素。
    在一九二七年春夏之交，北伐革命战争正继续向前胜利发展的时候，以蒋介石为首的国民党反动派，为了阻挡革命的彻底胜利和夺取革命胜利果实，就和帝国主义、封建势力勾结在一起，叛变革命，在“四一二”向中国人民开始了血腥大屠杀。而当时的中国共产党中以陈独秀为代表的领导却对于蒋介石汪精卫这类资产阶级反革命集团采取了可耻的投降政策，反对农民革命，拒绝武装工农，以至于解除工人、农民已有的武装，因而便利于蒋汪反革命的袭击，一九二五年到一九二七年的第一次中国大革命乃受了很大的挫败。在这样的情况下，中国共产党在毛泽东、朱德等同志的领导下，反对了陈独秀的右倾机会主义，继续高举中国革命的旗帜，坚决拥护农民革命，进行武装起义。一九二七年的八月一日，朱德、周恩来、贺龙、叶挺等同志在江西南昌首先举行武装起义，参加起义的部队有朱德同志领导的第九军、贺龙同志领导的第二十军和叶挺同志领导的十一军和第四军一部等约三万余人，从此诞生了完全在中国共产党独立领导下的中国人民完全崭新的军队，这就是当时所称的中国工农红军，抗日时期所称的八路军、新四军，现在所称的中国人民解放军。
    在南昌起义以后，八月中，湖北蒲圻、咸宁、崇阳等地农民武装起义。九月，湖南农民在毛泽东同志领导下，举行了著名的秋收武装起义，曾占领了平江、浏阳、萍乡、醴陵、株州等湘东各重要城市。广东海陆丰的农民，也在十月举行起义，占领了海丰、陆丰等城，组成了万人以上的工农红军。当时起义军则以敌我力量悬殊，于八月五日退出南昌，向北伐革命策源地广东进发。但在国民党反动派的优势力量的压迫下，并由于当时领导上的缺乏经验与错误，起义军在潮汕曾受了挫折，于是一部分转进到海陆丰与起义农民武装会合，另一部分在朱德同志领导下，退至江西，转入湖南，发动了湘南农民起义，遂又在湖南、江西交界地区宁冈、永新、遂川、茶陵、酃县等县即所谓井岗山地区与毛泽东同志领导的由湖南起义农民组成的工农革命军第一军第一师会合，成立了红四军。
    “八一”起义是中国共产党独立创建人民武装的开始，同时是开始了中国人民革命的新阶段，给中国人民的希望开拓了新的道路。毛主席在一九三八年十一月在“战争与战略问题”中论述中国共产党的战争史时说：“革命失败，得了惨痛的教训，于是有南昌暴动、秋收暴动与广州暴动，进入了创造红军的新时期。这个时期是我们党彻底认识军队重要性的极端紧要的时期。没有这一时期的红军及其战争，即是说假如共产党采取了陈独秀的取消主义的话，今天长期支持的抗日战争是不能设想的。”
    这个伟大的人民解放军创建史上具有最大关键意义的，乃是井岗山的会合。南昌起义部队是大革命时代国民革命军的革命骨干，它继承着大革命时代共产党所创造的最优秀的传统。这个起义部队与直接从群众运动中形成起来的在毛泽东同志领导下的革命武装相结合，就使这两者合而为一的武装得以在毛泽东同志的直接领导下，逐渐创造成为有历史以来与人民结合最密切的人民军队。在毛泽东同志的领导下，这个中国人民的军队很快地就形成了自己灵活的战略战术，确定了在无产阶级领导下的整套建军思想、整套建军原则与整套建军制度。这些思想、原则和制度被记录在著名的中国共产党红军第四军第九次代表大会的决议案中。这些思想和原则的基本内容，至今仍完全适用。正是因为这支中国人民武装从它成立之日起，就遵循着毛泽东同志的军事思想，军事方针，军事路线，不断克服各种错误倾向，跨过了严重的挫折，因而二十二年来能够获得广大人民的拥护，战胜一切困难，从小到大，从弱到强，而成为无敌的力量。
    自“八一”起义后，在十年土地革命战争中，中国工农红军曾先后在江西、湖南、福建、广东、湖北、安徽、河南、四川、陕西、甘肃、宁夏等省，建立了十余个大块革命根据地，发展到有三十万人的强大的人民武装，屡次粉碎了国民党反动派在帝国主义援助下的百万军队的“围剿”。只在一个时期因为错误路线违反了毛泽东同志的领导而受了严重的挫折，但又因为经过毛泽东同志的领导，得以使红军主力胜利地完成了二万五千里长征，进入抗日前进阵地的陕甘宁边区。抗日战争开始后，工农红军改编为八路军、新四军，成为了中国坚持抗日战争的中坚力量。在八年抗日战争中，它在日寇和国民党反动派的夹击之下，抗击了百分之六十四的侵华日军和百分之九十五的伪军，毙伤俘敌伪一百七十余万人，发展了九十三万正规军和二百二十万民兵，创造了遍及十九个省份和拥有九千九百五十万人口的解放区，保证了抗日战争的胜利。在三年解放战争中，中国人民解放军又击败了美帝国主义援助的国民党反动派，迄今已消灭敌人五百六十九万人，并使自己发展为四百万人的强大武力；解放了十七个整省，一亿四千三百余万中国人民，使整个解放区的人口扩大为二亿七千九百余万。现在它即将解放全中国。
    二十二年的人民解放军的历史证明，只要坚持了正确的政治路线和军事路线，保持艰苦奋斗的工作作风，完全和人民群众打成一片，任何强大的敌人都是能够打倒的，任何严重的因难都是能够克服的。
