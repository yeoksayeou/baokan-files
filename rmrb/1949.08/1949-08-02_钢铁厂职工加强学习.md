    Steel Mill Workers
    Strengthen Their Studies
    [This City News] In order to strengthen the cultural learning and improve the political level of the workers, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Workers' Union, under the leadership of the Propaganda and Education Department, has specially established the Workers' Spare Time South Plant Branch School, located in the South Plant Auditorium. The workers who signed up were very enthusiastic, with more than 300 people. It is divided into three classes: advanced, intermediate, and elementary, with classes held every night from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. The teaching materials mainly focus on politics, initially selecting "Social Development History," "Mao Zedong Thought," "On New Democracy," "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," and the worker cultural textbooks issued by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, such as "Labor Creates the World." The teachers are students from Peking University who are working during the summer vacation. Classes have now officially started.
