To commemorate "August 1st" Army Day, the North China Pictorial Society of the Political Department of the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is holding an exhibition of historical photographs of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War in Zhongshan Park, Beiping, from August 1st to 10th. Yesterday, the first day, more than 12,000 people visited.

The photo exhibition is divided into the following sections: The first section showcases the glorious war achievements of the North China Field Army and its predecessor, the Eighth Route Army, from the establishment of the anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines in North China by the Eighth Route Army, the Hundred Regiments Offensive, the counter-"mopping-up" operations, the capture of the first city Laiyuan, to the liberation of Peiping, Tianjin, and Taiyuan, and finally the liberation of the entire North China. The photos show the Eighth Route Army carrying rifles and fighting in the mountains and in the midst of snow, the North China Field Army pulling heavy artillery across the plains, infantry wading through icy rivers, setting up ladders, breaking through enemy lines, charging, bravely scaling the city walls, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat, and pursuing the remnants of the enemy. The second section shows the militia and the Eighth Route Army fighting side by side, transporting rolling logs and rocks, making straw dummies, demolishing bridges, cutting wires, overturning railway tracks, blowing up bunkers, and creating the famous landmine warfare, tunnel warfare, and the Baiyangdian water guerrilla team in Central Hebei—the Wild Goose Team. The third section is about the relationship between the army and the people. The Eighth Route Army helps organize and train the militia, helps the people learn, helps the people build houses, build dikes for flood control, fight drought and plant seeds, and helps with production. There are also various photos of workers and peasants enthusiastically supporting. The fourth section is about the spoils of war, including American-made rocket launchers, machine guns,榴弹炮, motorcycles, tanks, airplanes, rifles, and a large number of captured Chiang Kai-shek army officers' portraits.
