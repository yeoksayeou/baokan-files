　　Also on "The Driving Force of Social Development"

　　"The only force that has driven development in the millions of years from ape to man and from primitive man to modern man is the group." This statement is incorrect. "Group" is not the primary, let alone the sole, decisive factor in the evolution and development of mankind.

　　The communal life of primitive humans played a part in human evolution. As Comrade Wang Ping said, anyone who left the group would be killed; "using the strength of the group to compensate for the lack of wisdom, using the strength of the group to solve the difficulties of lacking tools or having inferior tools." The difference between humans and other animals lies in the creation and use of tools. The main characteristic of humans is "labor." Only labor enabled anthropoids to gradually transition from living in trees to living on the ground. The division of labor between the forelimbs and hindlimbs, and the gradual development of articulate language, senses, and brain organs to better adapt to labor, gradually and completely separated humans from other animals. Labor is the decisive factor in the transition from ape to man. Therefore, Engels said, "Labor created man himself." Communal living at that time was naturally formed and could better adapt to the environment and solve the difficulties of inferior tools. But the point is that it was labor that promoted the emergence of mankind. Without labor, the production of any tools—even the most inferior tools—would be impossible. The power of the group could protect the ancestors of mankind and make it easier for them to survive. However, simply living in groups could not promote the emergence of mankind, and could not transform ape into man, just like other gregarious animals. Therefore, the main force driving society is not "group," let alone the only force.

　　The history from the collapse of primitive communism to the emergence of the socialist system is the history of the struggle between the oppressed class and the oppressor class. When society develops to a certain stage, the old relations of production become an obstacle to the development of productive forces. For example, in the later period of the slave system, because slaves were in the state of "speaking tools" and were subjected to inhuman abuse and oppression, and at the same time, the rulers were completely disconnected from actual production, it caused the stagnation of production technology, sharpened the contradiction between productive forces and relations of production, and severely restricted the development of productive forces. When the oppressed rose up to resist more than once, it formed the inevitable class struggle in private system societies, overthrowing the old society and replacing it with a new society, which at a certain stage was progressive, suitable for the development of productive forces, and pushed society forward. Of course, class struggle is not an individual struggle but a collective "group" struggle. But we cannot therefore affirm that "group" is the only driving force for social progress, because class struggle is a phenomenon, and in essence, it is "the concrete manifestation of the contradiction between productive forces and relations of production." Therefore, the basic driving force of social development is productive forces, the contradiction between productive forces and relations of production, and not anything else—this is precisely one of the basic viewpoints we should grasp when studying the history of social development.

　　Comrade Wang Ping's "group" seems to be understood only from the perspective of the laboring masses, but the whole society is communal, including the laboring people, as well as the exploiting and ruling classes who do not work for a living. Talking about "group" in general terms is very easy to cause conceptual ambiguity. In addition, when the quotation from the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) is cited at the end, "The history of social development is also the history of the laboring masses," it seems to be meant to make us understand from here that "group" is the only force driving society. I think understanding this sentence should be based on the development of productive forces. Because the relations of production restrict the development of productive forces, it promotes the sharpening of class contradictions, which leads to the continuous resistance of the laboring masses, becoming class struggle, and promoting history. Therefore, it is said that "the history of social development is the history of the laboring masses." If we do not understand it from this aspect, and even conclude that "group" is the only force of social development, that would be quoting out of context and somewhat deviating.

　　也谈“社会发展的动力”
    贾特
    “从猿到人和从原始人到现代人，在这几百万年的过程中所赖以发展的唯一力量是群”，这句话是错误的。“群”在人类进化发展的过程中不是主要的，更不是唯一的起决定作用的因素。
    原始人类的群居生活，在人类进化上是起了一部分作用的，就象王坪同志讲的，谁离开队伍谁就被杀死；“用群的力量补知慧之不足，用群的力量解决缺乏工具或工具低劣的困难”。人和其它动物的区别在于创造并使用工具，人类主要的特征是“劳动”，惟有劳动才使类人猿逐渐由树上生活转到树下生活，前后肢分了工，更为着适应劳动逐渐有了有节语的产生，和感觉及脑器官的发达，逐渐完全的和其它动物分别开来。劳动是猿到人的决定因素。因此，恩格斯说，“劳动创造了人本身”。群居在当时是自然形成的，能够更好的适应环境，解决工具的低劣的困难，但问题是在于因为有了劳动才促成人类的产生，没有劳动，任何工具——即便是最低劣的工具的产生也是不可能的。群的力量可以卫护人类的祖先易于生存。但是单纯的群居并不能促使人类产生，不能从猿到人，正象其它群居的动物一样，因此推进社会的主要力量并不是“群”，更谈不到是唯一的力量。
    原始共产制崩溃到社会主义制度出现以前为止的历史，是被压迫阶级与压迫阶级斗争的历史，社会发展到一定阶段的时候，旧的生产关系成为生产力发展的障碍，如奴隶制度后期，由于奴隶处于“说话的工具”的物品状态之中，忍受着非人的虐待、压迫，同时，统治者和实际生产的完全脱节，遂造成了生产技术的停滞不前，使生产力与生产关系的矛盾尖锐化，严重的限制了生产力的发展，被压迫者不止一次地起来反抗的时候，就形成为私有制度社会中不可避免的阶级斗争，推翻了旧的社会而代之以新的社会，它在一定阶段上是进步的，适合于生产力的发展，把社会推前了一步。当然阶级斗争不是个体的而是集体的“群”的斗争。但我们并不能因此而肯定“群”是推动社会进步的唯一动力，因为阶级斗争是一种现象，在本质上它是“生产力与生产关系矛盾的具体表现。因此，社会发展的基本动力是生产力，是生产力和生产关系”的矛盾，而不是什么其它——这一点正是我们学习社会发展史所应该把握的基本观点之一。
    王坪同志所谈的“群”，似乎只是从劳动群众了解的，但整个社会是群居的，其中包括了劳动人民，也包括了不劳而食的剥削、统治阶级等等，笼统的谈“群”是极容易引起人们观念上的模糊的。另外在最后引到联共（布）党史中的“社会发展的历史同时也就是……劳动群众的历史”这句话时，好象是让我们从这里体会“群”是推进社会的惟一力量，我觉得了解这句话应该基于生产力的发展上来了解，由于生产关系束缚了生产力的发展，促成阶级矛盾的尖锐化，而引起了不断的劳动群众的反抗，成为阶级斗争，推动了历史，所以说，“社会发展的历史是：劳动群众的历史”，如果不从这方面了解，甚而因此断定“群”是社会发展的惟一力量，那将是断章取义，有所偏差的。
