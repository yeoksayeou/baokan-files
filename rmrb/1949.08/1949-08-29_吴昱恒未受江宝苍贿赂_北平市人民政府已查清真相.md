　　Wu Yuheng Did Not Accept Bribes from Jiang Baocang
  　Truth Cleared Up by the Beiping Municipal People's Government
    Regarding the news "North China People's Government Approves Confiscation of Property of Traitor Jiang Chaozong," carried in the Peiping-Tianjin newspapers on August 16, which stated: "His son colluded with Kuomintang special agents to bribe Wu Yuheng, the President of the pseudo-Beiping Local Court, with his residence in Nanwanzi, in this city, to be exempted from the charge of traitor," Mr. Wu, after reading the newspapers, immediately sent letters to various newspapers requesting corrections as this was inconsistent with the facts, and petitioned the North China People's Government for investigation. The North China People's Government found that the directive approving the Beiping Municipal People's Government's request to confiscate the property of traitor Jiang Chaozong on July 26 did not involve Jiang Baocang's house being used to bribe Wu Yuheng, nor did it involve Wu Yuheng exempting Jiang Chaozong from the charge of traitor. It immediately instructed the Municipal Government to investigate the truth of this matter. After receiving the instructions, the Municipal Government, through many days of investigation with relevant units such as the Custody Bureau, has determined that the statements in the aforementioned news were not factual. This is hereby corrected. Furthermore, the phrase "Jiang Baocang was summoned by the People's Court of this city" in the news is a mistake; it should be "North China People's Court." This is hereby corrected as well.

### 吴昱恒未受江宝苍贿赂　北平市人民政府已查清真相

　　吴昱恒未受江宝苍贿赂
  　北平市人民政府已查清真相
    八月十六日，平津各报所载“华北人民政府批准没收汉奸江朝宗产业”消息，其中所称：“其子乃勾结国民党特务，将其本市南湾子住宅贿给伪北平地方法院院长吴昱恒，得以免去汉奸罪名”一节。吴氏阅报后，以与事实不符，当即去函各报声请更正，并呈请华北人民政府予以查究。华北人民政府查得七月二十六日批准北平市人民政府呈请没收汉奸江朝宗财产之指令中并未涉及江宝苍的房屋贿给吴昱恒及由吴昱恒免去江朝宗汉奸罪名之事，当即指令市府查明此节真相。市府接到指示后，经多日来向清管局及本处等有关单位追查真相，结果已判明前项消息所称各节，并非事实，特此更正。又该消息所载“由本市人民法院拘传江宝苍到案”一语，其中“本市人民法院”系“华北人民法院”之误，特此一并更正。

    本社二十一日所发平市工业参观团延期起程稿中有专营啤酒的北平实业公司经理于忠所提根据各地市场需要及所产原料，“回来后便可据以转业”一句，应改为“以便研究开辟副业来维持现有的啤酒业务”。
