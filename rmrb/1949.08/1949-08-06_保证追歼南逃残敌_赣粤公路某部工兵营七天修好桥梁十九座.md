    To ensure the rapid pursuit and annihilation of the Kuomintang bandit troops fleeing south, an engineer battalion of the People's Liberation Army advancing along the Gan-Yue Highway displayed a high degree of hard work and dedication. In seven days, together with fraternal engineering units, they repaired nineteen bridges of various sizes that had been destroyed by the bandit 23rd Army on the Zhangshu to Ji'an section, enabling subsequent troops and supplies to be continuously transported to the front lines. On the evening of July 11th, when they received this task, the soldiers excitedly said, "In the past, they focused on demolition, now we must learn construction with even greater effort." Fierce challenges and responses unfolded between squads and platoons. When repairing the bridges, they did not take naps or rest, and sometimes even continued working day and night. The second squad of the first company, while repairing a single-arch bridge, drove wooden piles in water up to their chests, working through the night without sleep. When the instructor advised them to rest, Zhao Gouni, the deputy squad leader who was ill, said, "We have made a determined plan, and we must complete the task no matter what." When there was no lamp oil, the soldiers proposed, "We will work even if we have to use firewood for lighting." When the second company was repairing a six-arch bridge, the riverbed was made of bluestone, making it difficult to drive wooden piles, so the fourth squad did not rest for two consecutive nights, persisting in their work. The soldiers excitedly recited a clapper talk in the water: "Not afraid of sweating more in the heat, not afraid of the difficulty of driving piles in deep water, this is a good opportunity to perform meritorious service, we must work hard to serve the people." This wooden bridge with a load capacity of ten tons was quickly completed, and the construction of another six-arch bridge only took fourteen hours, greatly exceeding the normal bridge-building speed.

    保证追歼南逃残敌
    赣粤公路某部工兵营七天修好桥梁十九座
    【新华社湘赣前线五日电】为求迅速追歼向南逃窜的国民党匪军，沿赣粤公路前进的人民解放军某部工兵营，高度发扬了艰苦奋斗的精神，在七天内和兄弟工兵部队一回抢修好了樟树到吉安段被匪二十三军破坏的大小十九座桥梁，使后续部队和辎重能源源运往前方。七月十一号晚上，当他们接受这一任务时，战士们兴奋地说：“过去他们着重在爆破，现在要用更大的努力学会建设。”班、排之间展开了热烈的挑战和应战。在抢修桥梁时，他们不午睡，不休息，有时甚至昼夜不停地继续工作。该营一连二班在抢修一孔桥时，在深及胸脯的水中，曾澈夜不眠地打木桩。当指导员劝他们休息时，正害着病的副班长赵苟妮说：“我们订了决心计划，无论如何也要完成任务。”当没有灯油时，战士们提出：“架木柴照明也要工作下去。”该营二连在抢修一座六孔桥时，河底为青石，不容易打木桩，第四班便接连两夜未曾休息，坚持工作。战士们在水中兴奋地念着快板：“不怕天热多流汗，不怕水深打桩难，这是立功的好机会，为人民服务得好好干。”这一载重量十吨的木桥很快地便全部竣工，而且连架修的另一座六孔桥，也仅费时十四小时，大大超过了普通架桥速度。
