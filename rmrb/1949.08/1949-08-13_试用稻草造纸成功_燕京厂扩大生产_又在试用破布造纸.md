    [This City News] This city's Yanjing Paper Mill successfully made paper using rice straw at the end of July. It is now preparing to expand its equipment and is also trying to make paper using rags. During the period of Japanese puppet rule, the raw material used by the factory was pulp from the Northeast. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the source of pulp was cut off, and waste paper was used as raw material instead. Later, due to the lack of waste paper, work was suspended. After the liberation of Beiping, the factory used waste paper as raw material, but still felt that it was insufficient. Therefore, at the end of July, it began to experiment with rice straw for paper making, and the results were good. In early August, the Enterprise Bureau decided to use rice straw for paper making, and immediately began to prepare to modify the machines and expand production. It is preparing to install two large steaming spheres that can hold 6,000 catties; increase the weight of the pulping knife; and purchase straw cutters, dust collectors, etc. Currently, the factory is experimenting with using rags to make paper, and has achieved preliminary success. In this way, the difficulty of lacking raw materials has been solved, and the paper production will be greatly increased.

    试用稻草造纸成功
    燕京厂扩大生产
    又在试用破布造纸
    【本市讯】本市燕京造纸厂在七月底试用稻草造纸成功。现正着手扩充设备，并试用破布造纸。在日伪统治时期，该厂所用的原料是东北的纸浆。在国民党反动派统治时期，因纸浆来源断绝，改用废纸作原料，后因废纸缺乏而停工。北平解放后，该厂用废纸作原料，仍感不敷使用，遂于七月下旬，开始试验稻草制纸，结果成绩良好。八月初，企业局决定用稻草制纸后，即开始准备改装机器，扩大生产。准备按装两个能装六千斤的大蒸球；把打浆刀加重以及添购铡草机、除尘器等。现该厂正在试验用破布造纸，已获初步成功。这样，解决了原料缺乏的困难，产纸量将大大增加。
