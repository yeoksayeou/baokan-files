    【This Municipality News】 Encephalitis cases continue to be discovered in this city. In addition to the 67 cases reported on the 23rd, the Municipal Health Bureau's investigation as of the morning of the 26th revealed 9 new cases among the general public. Three of these individuals have already died, and six are currently receiving treatment at Zhonghe, Xiehe, and the Infectious Disease Hospital. To prevent the spread of encephalitis, the Health Bureau convened a meeting on the 24th with representatives from the Civil Affairs Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Construction Bureau, and Sanitation Brigade to broadly exchange views on the mosquito elimination issue and conduct preliminary discussions on specific methods for promoting this work. It was decided to mobilize citizens to actively launch a mosquito elimination campaign, ensuring that water in domestic water tanks and air raid water storage is kept clean, filling in muddy water pits on the streets, and removing weeds. Each police station of the Public Security Bureau will be responsible for supervising and inspecting households in each district; the Construction Bureau will be responsible for flushing the moat; and citizens are encouraged to install window screens and mosquito nets, use mosquito coils, and spray DDT as much as possible to prevent and eliminate mosquitoes. On the 25th, the Health Bureau dispatched two additional visiting teams (totaling four teams) to spray DDT in the residences of encephalitis patients and nearby ponds, remove stagnant and dirty water, and conduct quarantine on nearby residents, so that patients with similar or suspected symptoms can receive early diagnosis and treatment. The Health Bureau also scheduled a broadcast on the prevention of encephalitis on People's Radio at 6:20 PM on the 27th, and will begin propaganda with lantern slides in various cinemas within three or two days.

    【Additional News】 To respond to the mosquito elimination campaign and set an example by carrying out environmental sanitation work, the Municipal People's Government convened a meeting at the Health Bureau on the afternoon of the 25th with the heads of general affairs work from various bureaus and offices to discuss specific measures for spraying DDT, removing weeds, filling in pits and depressions, removing dirty water, and clearing sewer openings.
