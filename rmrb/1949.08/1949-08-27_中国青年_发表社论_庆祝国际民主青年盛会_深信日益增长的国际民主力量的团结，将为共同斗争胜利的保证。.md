　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 26th. The central organ publication of the China New Democratic Youth League - "China Youth," in its 16th issue, published an editorial entitled "Long Live the Friendship and Unity of Democratic Youth Worldwide," celebrating the grand gathering of international democratic youth now commencing in Budapest, the capital of Hungary. The editorial stated:

　　In August and September this year, international youth and students are holding various gatherings and activities in Budapest, the capital of Hungary. From August 14th to 28th, the World Youth and Student Festival is being held; from August 15th to 21st, the 10th World University Summer Games are being held; from September 2nd to 10th, the Second World Democratic Youth Congress will be convened; and in mid-September, the International Student Union will hold its 1949 Council meeting. September 4th marks the 35th International Youth Day, which will be commemorated simultaneously in various locations. The Chinese Democratic Youth Delegation, consisting of over one hundred members, departed on July 22nd and arrived in the Hungarian capital on August 9th. They are currently participating in the World Youth and Student Festival and have been warmly welcomed by youth from various countries.

　　During this period, we Chinese youth will hold various gatherings in major cities to celebrate the great unity of international youth and support the Second World Democratic Youth Congress, the World Youth and Student Festival, and other international democratic youth activities.

　　In this work, we should conduct widespread and in-depth internationalist propaganda and education. We should explain to the youth that without the assistance of the Soviet Union and the international revolutionary forces, the victory of the Chinese revolution would have been impossible. And even after victory, it would be impossible to consolidate it. Only by being faithful to internationalism can we eradicate imperialist aggression in any aspect, whether political, economic, or cultural; only then can our nation achieve true independence, and only then can our victory be consolidated.

　　We, the Chinese people, are closely connected with the Soviet Union, the New Democratic countries, the proletariats of all countries, and the broad masses of the people. We have a common enemy: the imperialists—especially the American imperialists. The American imperialists, through the North Atlantic Treaty, attempt to provoke a war of aggression against the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries, and to enslave the people of the world. In its recently published White Paper, although it admits that its plan to invade China has failed, it still claims to continue organizing special agents to overthrow the Chinese people's regime, and on August 6th, it put forward five principles for invading China. Therefore, we in China must, as Chairman Mao Zedong said, "lean to one side," "lean to the side of socialism." Supporting the socialist and democratic camp and opposing the reactionary imperialist camp is the path we should take.

　　In strengthening internationalist education, on the one hand, we must learn from the Soviet Union, the New Democratic countries, and all international revolutionary forces; we must learn from the Soviet youth and the democratic youth of all countries. This is because the Soviet Union is a socialist country, a powerful fortress of world peace, and the leader of the international peace camp. The Soviet people have rich experience in the struggle against imperialism, and they also have rich experience in building a socialist country. Soviet youth are models of struggle in the international democratic youth movement. On the other hand, we Chinese youth should also share our three years of experience in how to struggle against American imperialism and how to achieve victory with the youth of the oppressed nations of the East and the democratic youth of all countries. The victory of the Chinese revolution is also a victory for the international democratic camp. This victory not only inspires all young people who are engaged in a heroic struggle against imperialism and strengthens everyone's confidence in victory, but it also makes us Chinese youth even more responsible for supporting the struggles of international democratic youth, especially the youth of the oppressed nations of the East.

　　Our democratic youth delegation has participated in the grand gathering of international democratic youth, which is fortunate because it allowed them to receive internationalist education, learn from their experiences, and introduce their own experiences. Not only that, but we must also use every achievement of the international democratic youth movement and every achievement of the international democratic youth gathering as internationalist teaching materials to educate the broad masses of Chinese youth. From now on, the broad masses of Chinese youth must strengthen their concern for and support for every struggle of the democratic youth of all countries and various activities of international democratic youth, so that the relationship between Chinese youth and international democratic youth becomes even closer.

　　Our support for the grand gathering of international democratic youth cannot but make us think of the contributions of the conveners of these gatherings - the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students. The World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students are the leading centers of the democratic youth movement and student movement worldwide. Because of their heroic struggle and great contributions in the international democratic camp for the past three or four years, they have won high prestige among the broad masses of youth and students worldwide.

　　We Chinese youth have already heard on the radio that amidst thunderous cheers and singing, the World Youth and Student Festival has opened! The 10,000 young men and women and student representatives from 85 countries participating in the conference, including different nationalities, colors, classes, parties, and beliefs, are expressing the same idea in different languages: lasting peace, people's democracy, national independence, and a happy future for youth. We will be even more confident that the growing unity of international democratic forces will guarantee victory in our common struggle. Long live the friendship and unity of democratic youth worldwide!

　　“中国青年”发表社论
  　庆祝国际民主青年盛会
    深信日益增长的国际民主力量的团结，将为共同斗争胜利的保证。
    【新华社北平二十六日电】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会机关刊物——中国青年第十六期以“全世界民主青年友谊团结万岁”为题，发表社论，庆祝现在匈牙利京城布达佩斯开始的国际民主青年的盛会。社论说：
    今年八九月里，国际青年和学生在匈牙利首都布达佩斯，召开各种集会与进行各种活动。八月十四日到二十八日，举行世界青年及学生联欢大会；八月十五日到二十一日，举行第十届世界大学生夏季运动会；九月二日到十日，召开世界民主青年第二次代表大会，九月中旬召开国际学联一九四九年度理事会。在九月四日，又是第三十五届国际青年节，在各地同时举行纪念。中国民主青年代表团一行一百余人于七月二十二日出国，八月九日已抵匈京，目前正参加世界青年及学生联欢大会，受到各国青年的热烈欢迎。
    我们中国青年在这一段时间中，将在各大城市里召开各种集会，庆祝国际青年大团结，拥护世界民主青年第二次代表大会、世界青年及学生联欢大会等国际民主青年活动。
    在这个工作中，我们应当普遍地深入地进行国际主义的宣传教育。我们应该向青年说明：没有苏联的援助，没有国际革命力量的援助，中国革命胜利是不可能的。胜利了，也不可能巩固。只有忠实于国际主义，我们才能根绝帝国主义政治、经济、文化等任何方面的侵略，我们民族才能得到真正的独立，我们的胜利才能巩固。
    我们中国人民是和苏联、新民主主义国家、各国无产阶级及广大人民休戚相关的。我们有共同的敌人，帝国主义者——特别是美帝国主义者。美帝国主义者在欧洲订了北大西洋公约，企图挑拨起侵略苏联及新民主主义国家的战争，奴役全世界人民。它在最近公布的白皮书，虽然供认了侵略中国计划已经失败，但仍然声称继续组织特务来推翻中国人民政权，八月六日又提出了侵略中国的五项原则。因此，我们中国必须如毛泽东主席所说的“一边倒”，“倒向社会主义一边”。拥护社会主义和民主阵营，反对帝国主义反动阵营，这就是我们应走的道路。
    在加强国际主义教育的时候，在一方面，我们要向苏联、新民主主义国家及一切国际革命力量学习，向苏联青年及各国民主青年学习。这是因为苏联是社会主义国家，是世界强大的和平堡垒，是国际和平阵营的领导者。苏联人民有着丰富的反对帝国主义的斗争的经验，同时又有丰富的社会主义国家建设的经验。苏联青年是在国际民主青年运动中的斗争的模范。在另一方面我们中国青年也应当把三年来对美帝国主义如何进行斗争如何取得胜利的经验，介绍给东方被压迫民族青年及各国民主青年。中国革命的胜利，同时也就是国际民主阵营的胜利，这个胜利，不但鼓舞了一切和帝国主义进行英勇斗争的青年，增强了大家必胜的信心，而且也使得我们中国青年，对于声援国际民主青年，特别是东方被压迫民族的青年的斗争，更加加重了责任。
    我国民主青年代表团，参加了国际民主青年的盛会，得以受到国际主义教育，学习他们的经验与介绍自己的经验，这是值得庆幸的。不仅如此，我们还要把国际民主青年运动每一成就，把国际民主青年盛会中每一成就，作为国际主义的教材，来教育我国广大青年。从今以后，我国广大青年要加强关心与声援各国民主青年每一次斗争和国际民主青年各种活动。使得我国青年与国际民主青年的关系更加密切。
    我们拥护国际民主青年的盛会，使我们不能不想到这些盛会的召集者——世界民主青年联盟与国际学生联合会的功绩，世界民主青年联盟与国际学生联合会是全世界民主的青年运动与学生运动的领导中心，由于它们三四年来在国际民主阵营中的英勇斗争和伟大贡献，已经赢得了全世界广大青年和学生中的很高的威信。
    我们中国青年已经从广播里听到，在震天响的欢呼与歌唱中，世界青年及学生联欢大会开幕了！参加大会的八十五国的男女青年和学生代表一万人，他们包括不同的民族、肤色、阶级、党派和信仰，以不同的语言，却表达一个相同的思想：持久和平、人民民主、民族独立与青年幸福的将来。我们将更有信心地认为：日益增长的国际民主力量的团结，将为我们共同斗争胜利的保证。全世界民主青年友谊团结万岁！
