This victory not only marks the complete elimination of the enemy on land and sea in Shandong and the liberation of the entire territory, but also marks the failure of Chiang Kai-shek bandits, with the help of their master, American imperialism, not only in land operations but also in naval operations, giving a serious blow to the conspiracy of American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek bandits to attempt to blockade our sea transportation. The telegram finally expressed the hope that all commanders and fighters would be vigilant and victoriously defend the motherland's coast.
