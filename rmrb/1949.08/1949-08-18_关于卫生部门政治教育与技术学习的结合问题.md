On the Integration of Political Education and Technical Learning in the Health Sector
		Qian Xinzong, Director of the Health Department of the North China Military Region

	I. The Tasks of Education in the Health Sector

	The entire North China region has been liberated. With the changes in the environment, the tasks of the North China Liberated Area have also shifted from combat missions to production and construction tasks. Everything in the past revolved around war, while everything today revolves around construction. To build, we must have the ability to build, learn science, improve technology, manage factories..., all of which we did not understand or understood very little in the past. Therefore, the new work presents new problems, requiring us to learn, learn, and learn again!

	Compared with the past, the tasks of education are even more arduous. The tasks of education in the health sector include political theory learning, cultural education, and technical improvement. Today, the main tasks are theoretical learning and technical improvement.

	The education policy has also changed with the environment. In the past, education was "learn what you need," but today it requires "systematic learning from the beginning." In the past, we opposed whatever bad tendencies arose, but today, education based solely on tendencies is not enough. Our scope has expanded, and our work objects are complex, requiring us to possess more natural science knowledge. Learning social science and natural science must be a long-term plan starting from the beginning and must have a formal system, otherwise, it will not be learned well.

	Educational work is also a way of contacting the masses. Its scope is large, and its contact surface is wide, not limited to the backward or the progressive, but including all cadres and soldiers. At the same time, its objects are also extremely complex, such as differences in culture, good or bad thoughts, and individual diligence. Therefore, educational work cannot be monopolized by educators alone, but must effectively organize the masses, help each other, and create a conscious and led mass movement. We must investigate and study, observe and analyze. Sitting in the office and daydreaming will not achieve much.

	II. The Issue of Integrating Technical Learning and Political Learning

	The relationship between technical learning and political learning is a historical issue in the health sector. Political cadres demand more time to study politics, while technical cadres demand more time to study technology. This seems to be a dispute over time, but in essence, it is a matter of thought and perspective. Our technology is built on a political foundation. We use dialectical materialism to study technology, that is, we use the Marxist-Leninist stance, viewpoint, and method to study technology, improve technology, and make it better serve the people. Otherwise, it will not be much different from a bourgeois doctor. Some may ask, "Bourgeois doctors do not understand Marxism-Leninism, so why can they learn technology well?" Yes, such facts did exist in the old society. We must ask: First, how many achievements of this kind were there in the old society? Second, how much did these people do for the country and the people despite their good technology? How many talents did they cultivate? Not to compare with the Soviet Union, but even compared with the half-baked doctors we have trained, it is very clear that those with good technology contribute very little to the country and the people, while those with poor technology contribute more. If they had the Marxist-Leninist stance, viewpoint, and method, plus their skilled technology, their contribution to the people would be completely different. This shows that a doctor without a class stance, not serving politics, even if they have good technology, their contribution to the people is still extremely small. With a political stance, although the technology is not very advanced, every bit of their technology is highly utilized and used for the welfare of the people, they are extremely great. Now society is different. Those who are backward, that is, those who do not care about politics, are regretting, transforming, and seeking progress in order to catch up with us. Some of our comrades are instead looking backward, thinking that they became experts because they focused on learning technology and did not care about politics, which is extremely wrong. This is also not allowed in a new democratic society. We should respect the scientific knowledge and technology of those experts and learn from them honestly. However, we should despise their political backwardness and help them progress. To emulate their political backwardness is to lose our stand.

	Second is the issue of the standpoint of technical workers. To have a clear class standpoint, we should strengthen political learning, otherwise, a full of enthusiasm will still not do things well, and may even have the opposite effect.

	New democracy is still a class society, and its economic and ideological forms are very complex. Without the proletarian viewpoint and standpoint, in the sharp and diverse class struggle, we cannot distinguish between good and bad, between the enemy and ourselves, between black and white, and we do not know what is progressive, what should be advocated, what should be promoted, what is backward, what should be opposed, what is real progress, and what is disguise and conspiracy. That is dangerous. Therefore, the Central Committee requires everyone to study theory, stand firm, and distinguish right from wrong. No matter what work we do, whether we are political cadres, supply cadres, or technical cadres, it is very important and must be carried out well. This is a matter for the whole Party, not just a few people. Otherwise, we will fall behind, degenerate, and even go in the opposite direction. Everyone must be vigilant.

	Third, it is to be proficient in business. The above said that every comrade must work hard to study politics and improve class consciousness. This does not deny the importance of technical learning. Without technology, we cannot become a technical department and cannot open hospitals. This is also certain. In particular, older comrades with low technical skills are more eager to learn technology. However, this does not conflict with the effort to study politics, but is completely consistent. This is not to say that political learning is the main thing, and technical learning is secondary. Generally speaking, technical learning and political learning are equally important. The health sector is not a special unit. The instructions of the Political Department of the Military Region should be implemented according to the specific conditions of the health sector, without any exceptions. The instructions stipulate that half of the time is spent learning military affairs, and half of the time is spent learning politics. For the technical cadres of the health sector, it means half of the time is spent learning theory and current affairs policies, and half of the time is spent learning technology and cultural knowledge. In the past, because we did not solve the relationship between political learning and technical learning well, the progress was very slow. In the future, with correct understanding and research methods, the improvement of technology may be faster. Political learning belongs to the category of social science, and technical learning belongs to the category of natural science. Learning social science is very helpful for the research of natural science. The consistency of learning politics and technology is just like the consistency of natural science and social science. It is wrong to oppose them.

	After clarifying the understanding of political learning and technical learning, the problem is the specific requirements and methods of learning. If learning becomes a burden, it will inevitably be opposed by comrades, and learning will not be carried out. It will waste time and not learn anything. For example, discussion meetings without any preparation or central topics, without ideological leadership, lacking planning, and with empiricist leadership methods and guerrilla habits, will not help comrades or the work. Of course, comrades will object. This objection is not to political learning, but to empiricism and guerrilla habits, which is correct. We must pay attention to overcoming them and strive to correct them.

	We can completely implement the learning time according to the instructions of the Political Department of the Military Region. Therefore, we feel that today is not a matter of time, but how we can organize it scientifically, use time, and learn from the beginning in a planned and formal way. This requires all comrades to develop politically, have clear minds, and have a large capacity. A person who is unsettled, thinking about this today and that tomorrow, only sees the small things in front of him, and only gets entangled in personal problems, cannot learn anything and do a good job. Only by clearing the many fantasies in the brain can we squeeze out time to learn theory and technology. Otherwise, although we shout to learn politics, we cannot learn politics, and we shout to improve technology, but we cannot improve technology. Circumlocuting and having many opinions on trivial matters in work and life, in fact, we cannot do a good job. The reason is that there are too many bad ideas in his brain, which are full, and other things will not be able to fit in. These comrades are very dangerous and should be vigilant.

	III. The Question of Learning Attitude

	Everyone has the desire to learn, but the degree is different. Some people learn earnestly and diligently, some people perfunctorily deal with it, some people are forced to, and some people are out of temporary feelings, not truly conscious. Therefore, the difference in the degree of diligence in learning is too great. Educators must solve this problem, so that diligent people improve their methods, and people with incorrect attitudes correct their attitudes. Everyone has a truly conscious desire to learn and appropriate learning methods, then we can do a good job of learning. The bourgeois idea of individual achievement and standing out is outdated. A selfish society cannot cultivate real experts, just as selfish people cannot learn anything. We advocate collective learning, helping each other, and making progress together. If we persist in this for ten or twenty years, what we did not understand in the past, we can understand in the future, and what was not good in the past can be good in the future. There have been countless precedents in the Soviet Union and China in the past. The problem is one's own consciousness and perseverance. Only in this way can we cultivate a large number of experts who have both a high degree of class consciousness and excellent scientific and technological skills to build a new China. To repeat, learning must have a conscious requirement, the correctness of leadership, and objective conditions (material conditions) should be unified, but the degree of consciousness is still important. We hope that everyone will start from scratch, but do not try to swallow more than you can chew, causing indigestion. Thinking too much will not allow you to learn more, and will make you lose confidence in your learning, tightening at the beginning and loosening at the end, starting strongly but finishing weakly, which is harmful to our progress.

	In short: The relationship between political learning and technical learning is the dividing line between employees and masters. Without political consciousness, without learning politics, and without improving class consciousness, no matter how much work he does or how many years he has been in the revolution, he is still an employee, because he has no class consciousness. With true class consciousness, although he joined the revolution late, he is still a revolutionary fighter and still a master in the revolutionary camp. Therefore, learning politics and technology is not a matter of time, but a matter of thought and concept. This should be universally publicized and educated. Learning technology without learning politics is wrong, and learning politics without learning business (technology) is also wrong. Only when this idea is clear can we correctly handle the relationship between political learning and technical learning.

　　关于卫生部门政治教育与技术学习的结合问题
    华北军区卫生部部长  钱信忠
    一　卫生部门教育工作的任务
    华北全区已获解放，华北解放区的任务，也随着环境的变化，即由战斗任务变为生产建设任务。过去的一切是围绕着战争，今天的一切是围绕着建设。要建设就要有建设的本事，就要学科学，要提高技术，要管理工厂……，而这些我们过去都不懂或懂得很少。因此新的工作提出了新的问题，要求我们学习，学习，再学习！
    教育工作的任务，与过去比较起来，是更加繁重了。卫生部门教育工作任务，是政治理论学习，文化教育与技术提高。而今天主要的则是理论学习和技术的提高。
    教育方针也是随着环境的变化而有所改变的，以往的教育是“用什么学什么”，今天则要求“正规的有系统的从头学起”，过去是有什么不良倾向反对什么，今天仅按倾向教育是不够的。我们的范围大了，工作对象复杂了，必须具备更多的自然科学。而学习社会科学与自然科学必须有长远打算从头学起，必须有正规制度，否则是学不好的。
    教育工作也是对群众的联系工作。他的范围是大的，接触面是宽的，他不仅限于落后的或进步的，而是所有的干部战士。同时他的对象，又是极复杂的，如文化的高低，思想的好坏，个人勤懒程度等。因此教育工作决不可能只由教育工作者包办，而必须很好的组织群众，互相帮助，造成自觉的有领导的群众运动。必须调查研究，观察分析。坐在机关中空想，是不会有多大成效的。
    二　技术学习与政治学习的结合问题
    技术学习与政治学习的关系，在卫生部门，是个历史性的问题。政治干部要求较多的时间学政治。技术干部要求较多的时间学技术，看起来，似乎是时间上的争执，实质上，是个思想问题，看法问题。我们的技术是建筑在政治基础之上的，我们是用唯物辩证法去研究技术，也即是说是用马列主义的立场观点与方法去研究技术，提高技术，并使之很好的为人民服务，否则就与资产阶级的医生无多大区别。也许有人会问，资产阶级的医生不懂马列主义，为什么也能学好技术，是的，旧社会的确也存在这样的事实。我们要问：第一、旧社会里这样有成就的研究有多少？第二、这些人虽然有好的技术，究竟又为国家人民作了多少事情？究竟培养了多少人材？不要与苏联比就是与我们培养出来的半生不熟的医生比起来，很显然的技术好的对国家人民贡献很小，技术差的贡献反而很大。如果他们有了马列主义的立场观点方法，加上他熟练的技术，对人民贡献就完全不同了。这说明一个医生没有阶级立场，不为政治服务，纵然有好的技术，对人民的贡献，仍然是极微小的。有了政治立场，虽然技术不大高明，但他的一分一毫技术，都得到了高度的发挥，都用之于人民的福利事业，他就极其伟大；现在社会不同了，落后的即是不问政治的人，自己都在懊悔，在改造，在求进步，以便赶上我们，而我们有些同志反而向后看，反而以为他们就是由于专心一意学技术不问政治，因而成了专门家，这是极其错误的，这也是新民主主义社会所不允许的。对那些专门家的科学知识和技术，我们应当尊重，并向他们老老实实的学习，但对他们的政治落后，应当卑视，应当帮助他们进步，向他们的政治落后看齐，就是丧失立场。
    其次是技术工作者立场问题。如何使自己有明确的阶级立场，应加强政治学习，否则满腔热血，仍然办不好事情，甚至于起相反的作用。
    新民主主义，仍然是个阶级的社会，经济形态意识形态很复杂，如果没有无产阶级的观点立场，在尖锐的多样的阶级斗争中，分不清好坏，分不清敌我，分不清黑白，不知哪些是进步的，该提倡，该发扬，哪些是落后的，该反对，哪些是真的进步，哪些是伪装是阴谋，哪就危险。因此中央要求大家学习理论，站稳立场，辨别是非，不管是作什么工作的，不管政治干部，供管干部或技术干部都非常重要，必须很好进行，这是全党的事情，不是少数人的事情，否则就会使自己掉队堕落，甚至于背道而驰，大家必须警惕。
    第三、是精通业务。上面说每个同志必须努力学习政治，提高阶级觉悟，这并不是否定技术学习的重要，没有技术就不能成为技术部门，就不能开医院，这也是肯定的。尤其是技术不高的老同志，更迫切需要学习技术；但这并不与努力学习政治相冲突，而完全是一致的。这也不是说以政治学习为主，技术学习是次要的；一般的说，技术学习与政治学习是完全同样的重要，卫生部门同样不是什么特殊的单位，军区政治部的指示应当根据卫生部门的具体情况，贯彻执行，没有什么例外。指示规定二分之一的时间学习军事。二分之一的时间学政治。对卫生部门的技术干部来说，即是二分之一的时间学理论与时事政策，二分之一的时间，学技术与文化知识。过去由于我们对于政治学习与技术学习的关系没有很好的解决，因而进步很慢，今后有了正确的认识和研究的方法，技术的提高可能进步更快。政治学习是属于社会科学范畴的，技术学习是属于自然科学范畴的，学习社会科学，对自然科学的研究帮助很大，学习政治与技术的一致性，正如自然科学与社会科学的一致性一样，如果把他对立起来是错误的。
    在政治学习与技术学习认识明确以后，问题就是学习的具体要求和方法了；如果学习成为一个负担，必然遭到同志们的反对，学习就不会搞起来，既耽误时间又学不到东西；如毫无准备，又无中心的讨论会，没有思想领导、缺乏计划、临时乱抓的经验主义的领导方法和游击习气，对同志没有帮助，对工作也没有好处，当然同志们会反对，这反对不是反对政治学习，而是反对经验主义和游击习气，这是对的，我们必须注意克服。努力改正。
    学习时间我们按照军区政治部指示，是完全可以行得通的，因此我们觉得今天不是时间问题，而是我们如何科学的组织起来，利用时间，有计划的，正规的从头学起。这就要求全体同志，政治要开展，头脑要清醒，度量要大。一个五神不定的人，今天想这，明天想那，一切只看见眼前小事，只是从个人问题上去纠缠不清，是不可能学到东西作好工作的。只有把脑里的许多幻想肃清了，才有可能挤出时间学理论学技术，否则，虽然叫喊学习政治，学不了政治，叫喊提高技术，提高不了技术。转弯抹角，对工作生活琐事意见很多，实际上，又作不好工作，原因就是他的脑子里坏思想装得太多了，装满了，其他东西将无法装进去。这些同志，非常危险，应当好好警惕。
    三　学习态度问题
    学习要求是人人有的，但他的程度就不一样，有的人是真心刻苦的学习，有的人则敷衍应付，有的人是被迫，有的人是出于一时的感情，并非真正的自觉，故学习勤勉程度相差是太多了。教育工作者就要解决这个问题，使勤勉的人改进方法，使态度不正确的人端正态度，大家既有真正出于自觉的学习要求，又有适当的学习方法，我们学习就可以搞好。希望个人成就独出人头的资产阶级的想法已经过时了，自私自利的社会，是培养不出什么真正专家来的，正象自私自利的人学不到什么东西一样。我们提倡集体学习，互相帮助，共同进步。这样十年二十年的坚持下去，过去不懂的，以后可以懂了，过去不好的以后可以好了，苏联和中国过去都有过无数的先例。问题是自己的觉悟和毅力，只有这样我们就可能培养出大批既有高度的阶级觉悟，又有优良的科学技术的专门家，建设新中国。重说一遍，学习必须有自觉的要求，领导上的正确和客观条件（物质条件）三者应当统一起来，但重要的还是自觉的程度。我们希望大家从头学起，但不要贪多嚼不烂，引起消化不良。这样想的多学不了，会使自己的学习，失去信心，前紧后松，虎头蛇尾，对我们的进步是有害的。
    总之：政治学习与技术学习的关系，是雇佣与主人翁的分界线，没有政治自觉，不学习政治不提高阶级觉悟，不管他作了多少工作，革命了多少年，他始终还是个雇佣，因为他没有阶级觉悟。有真正的阶级觉悟，虽然参加革命晚，但仍然不失为一个革命的战士，仍然不失为革命阵营中的主人翁。因此学习政治与技术不是时间问题，而是个思想问题，观念问题，对这一点应当普遍进行宣传教育，单学技术不学政治是不对的，单学政治不学业务（技术）也是不对的，只有这个思想明确了才能正确的处理政治学习和技术学习的关系问题。
