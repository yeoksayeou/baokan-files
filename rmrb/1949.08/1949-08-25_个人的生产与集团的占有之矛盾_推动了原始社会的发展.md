　　The Contradiction Between "Individual Production and Collective Ownership" Promotes the Development of Primitive Society
　　Xiaolin
　　In primitive communist society, there was no contradiction between the productive forces and the relations of production, but there were social contradictions. This contradiction was: "the contradiction between individual production and collective ownership."
　　The forward development of the "contradiction between individual production and collective ownership" gradually led to the emergence of private ownership. In that historical stage, the emergence of "private ownership" was progressive. Because only on the basis of private ownership could production enthusiasm be improved and the forward development of production be promoted. This is precisely the law of development of primitive society. In communist society, there is no contradiction between the productive forces and the relations of production; instead, they are in harmony. This means that the old contradiction is resolved, and a new contradiction arises. This new contradiction is "the contradiction between social production and social needs." "Criticism and self-criticism" is generated on the basis of this contradiction. It in turn has a counter-effect on social production—accelerating the advancement of social production.

　　“个人的生产与集团的占有之矛盾”推动了原始社会的发展
    小林
    原始共产主义社会生产力和生产关系是没有矛盾的，但有社会的矛盾。这种矛盾是：“个人的生产与集团的占有之矛盾”。
    “个人的生产与集团占有的矛盾”的向前发展，就逐渐产生了私有。在当时的历史阶段，“私有”的产生，是进步的。因为在当时只有在私有的基础上，才能提高生产兴趣，才能促使生产的向前发展。这也正是原始社会发展的规律。在共产主义社会中，生产力和生产关系没有矛盾，而是适合的。这就是旧的矛盾解决了，而又产生了新的矛盾。这个新的矛盾便是“社会的生产与社会的需要之矛盾”。“批评与自我批评”就是产生在这个矛盾基础之上的。它反转过来再给社会生产以反作用——加速地推动社会生产前进。
