Improving Production Methods, Reorganizing Labor
    Ping City No. 2 Soy Sauce Factory
  　Output and Quality Improved, Costs Decreased Monthly
    [This City News] Due to the hard work of the workers, the establishment of new work systems, and the improvement of production technology, the Beiping No. 2 Soy Sauce Factory has begun to increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs. In July, the factory produced more than 74,400 catties of soy sauce, an increase of 14,000 catties compared to June. In August, 61,500 catties were produced in 20 days, and it is estimated that the entire month will produce at least 90,000 catties. In terms of cost, the material cost consumption in July was 1.5% less than in June, electricity consumption was 8 degrees less, and coal consumption was 6.5 tons less.
    The factory has a total of more than 20 workers. Administratively, a factory-wide meeting is held every week to arrange work and discuss work plans. In July, in order to improve product quality and reduce costs, all the workers of the factory thought of ways. First, the koji room workers came up with a rotational rest system. In the past, workers rested on Sundays, so the koji room could not receive materials from Fridays onwards (because it takes four days from raw materials to finished koji). From July 1st, workers took rotational rests, and some people were on duty on Sundays, making four more batches of koji per month, an increase of nearly double the original output. Other workers also volunteered to work overtime, and if the work was not finished when they got off work every day, they would continue to work until it was completed without asking for overtime pay. In terms of manufacturing methods, the factory has used hard fermentation instead of brewing fermentation since June, reducing the fermentation time from three months to one and a half months, which is one of the important reasons for the increase in output in July. At the same time, administratively, the daily work report system was implemented on a trial basis from July, which provided a detailed understanding of the workers' work situation. According to the opinions of the workers' groups, workers who were not suitable for their positions were reassigned. Labor was strictly divided and human resources were actively used. Previously, the factory building was divided into four departments, now it is divided into seven departments, each department has a production team leader. In addition to the team leader, the workers in each department can help each other at any time according to the needs of the work. This more fully utilizes the workers' production capacity.
    In terms of reducing costs, workers try to avoid waste during work. The boiler room screens the coal that is burned, picks out the coal kernels, and then burns them. Also, because of the change to hard fermentation, the fermentation time is shortened, and the steam used is reduced. Therefore, coal consumption in July was 6.5 tons less than in June. When using water, workers were afraid of wasting water and increasing the daily power consumption of the water pump. When the water pump had minor problems, it was immediately repaired, so it used 8 degrees of electricity less than in June. As a result, the output in July increased, but the consumption of materials decreased. (Since June, the factory has used soybean cake bran instead of sorghum as raw materials, which has already reduced the cost of major raw materials by half.)
    In addition, product quality has also improved. In July, the factory's technicians and workers conducted detailed research and review of the cooling of finished products, the washing of containers, and the use of preservatives, to ensure that the products are not moldy and meet the standard salinity.
    The factory is now planning to expand its equipment. The temperature-controlled brewing room will be expanded by one and a half times. The number of oil presses will be increased from two to five. The oil boiling pot will be improved. In the past, it took six hours to boil using direct fire. It is planned to use waste heat from the boiler for heating, which will take only two hours. This saves both time and coal. At the same time, there are plans to add twenty-one oil storage tanks, which are expected to hold 300,000 catties per month, more than twice the current capacity. With such a large increase in output, only four or five workers will be added. In this way, costs can be further reduced.

　　改进生产方法重组劳力
    平市第二酱油厂
  　产量质量提高成本逐月减低
    【本市讯】北平第二酱油厂由于工人的努力生产，建立了新的工作制度和改进生产技术，开始做到增加产量、提高品质与减低成本。该厂七月份出产酱油七万四千四百多斤，比六月份多出了一万四千斤。八月份里，二十天就出了六万一千五百斤，预计全月至少可出九万斤。成本方面，七月份的材料成本消耗量比六月份少了百分之一·五，电力少用了八度，煤少用了六吨半。
    该厂工人共二十多人。行政上每星期都开一次全厂大会，布置工作，讨论工作计划。七月间，该厂工人为了提高产品的质量，减低成本，大家都想办法。首先，曲室工人想出了轮休制。以前，工人们是星期日都休息，所以曲室从星期五起就不能领料（因为从原料到成曲，要经过四天）。从七月一日起，工人轮休，星期日也有人值班，每月多制四次曲，比原来增产将近一倍。其他工人，也都自动义务加班，每天下班时，如果工作没完，就继续作完再走，也不要加班费。在制造方法上，该厂自六月起用硬发酵法代替酝酿发酵，使发酵时间从三个月减到一个半月，这是七月份增产的重要原因之一。同时，行政上从七月份起，试行每日工作报告制，对工人工作情形，有详细的了解。并根据工人小组讨论的意见，把不适合工作岗位的工人，重新调动一下。严密分工，活用人力。以前厂房共分四部，现在分成七部，每部有一生产组长，除组长以外，各部的工人，可按工作的需要，随时互助。这样，更充分的发挥了工人的生产能力。
    在减低成本方面，工人们在工作时尽量避免浪费，锅炉房把烧的煤筛一遍，挑出煤核再烧。又因为改用硬发酵法，缩短发酵时间，用的蒸汽减少。所以七月份用煤较六月份少了六吨半。工人在使水时，怕浪费了水增加了水泵日用电量。水泵有了小毛病，就马上修好，因此比六月份少用了八度电。结果，七月份的产量增多了，消耗的材料成品反倒减少。（该厂自六月份起，用豆饼麸子代替高粱作原料，已使主要原料费减少了一半。）
    此外，产品品质方面也有提高，七月里，该厂技师和工人对成品的冷却，容器的洗刷，防腐剂的使用，都作了详细的研究和检讨，保证出品不霉，而且够标准的盐度。
    该厂现正计划扩充设备。把温酿室扩大一倍半。把榨油机从两架增到五架。改良熬油锅，以前用直接火要熬六小时，计划改用锅炉废气加热，有两小时就成。又省时又省煤。同时计划添二十一个盛油桶，预计每月可盛三十万斤，比现在多两倍，产量增加这样多，工人只添四、五人。这样，成本更可减低了。
