    [Ping City News] The Beiping Municipal People's Government Enterprise Bureau convened a joint meeting on the 3rd, bringing together the heads of 20 units from its subordinate factories and mines to report on their work in July and to arrange the work plan for August. According to the reports from various units, the production performance of most factories was generally good, and some factories even exceeded their production achievements in June. For example, the Second Soy Sauce Factory not only exceeded its output by more than 14,000 catties but also improved the quality and saved six tons of coal and 18 kilowatt-hours of electricity. However, due to the impact of continuous rain, the coal mines' output was less than half of the original plan. However, there is still a large amount of coal in storage, so there should be no problem with the city's winter coal supply. In terms of security work, all factories and mines have strengthened fire-fighting equipment, replenished and reorganized fire brigades, and raised vigilance. The Qinghe Woolen Mill was able to immediately extinguish a fire caused by an electric wire on July 7. Currently, the factory and the Yanjing Paper Mill conduct fire drills once a week. However, some units still have serious complacency. For example, the comrade in charge of storage at the Mentougou Coal Mine did not even know what was stored in the warehouse. Only after a series of explosions did they pay attention.

    In terms of establishing cost accounting, all units have begun to work on it. The Qinghe Woolen Mill has stipulated that the production unit should be the economic accounting unit, with each part being responsible separately under unified leadership. However, some individual units still have serious bureaucracy. It has been half a year since the takeover, and they still have not clarified the inventory of the taken-over materials.

    In terms of democratizing factory management, although it has attracted the attention of the leadership of various factories and mines, such as the Mentougou Coal Mine and the Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, which have both inspected the leadership, only two units have established trade unions in July, and not a single factory management committee has been established. In response to the above situation, the Enterprise Bureau formulated the following work plan for August at the meeting: (1) Continue the work plan for the democratization of factory management in July and complete the establishment of factory management committees in all factories. (2) Continue to strengthen security work and conduct a preliminary summary. (3) Strictly implement cost accounting, starting with small factories to make a typical summary. (4) Continue to carry out the conservation campaign, with numerical records of achievements. (5) Complete a comprehensive work report from each factory since the takeover and check the situation of the half-year production plan. (6) Conduct political and professional tests for cadres in each factory and mine to check and promote learning. (7) Study the work systems of each factory and mine.

    At the meeting, Director Mou Zexian emphasized that all work must not only have calls to action and deployments but also must have inspections. Work should strive to be thorough, and procedures should be simplified as much as possible. He criticized the bureaucratic work style of some units where official documents take up to a month to travel and demanded that it be resolutely corrected. Deputy Director Jia Tingsan instructed everyone: When carrying out the democratic movement, timely inspections are necessary, and we must neither be divorced from the masses nor be a tail behind them.

    平企业局各厂矿会议
    确定八月份工作计划
    纠正官僚主义作风贯彻民主管理
    【平市讯】北平市人民政府企业局于三日召集所属各厂矿二十个单位的负责人，举行联席会，汇报七月份工作，布置八月份工作计划。根据各单位的汇报，在生产方面，一般各厂成绩尚好，有的工厂并超过了六月份的生产成绩。如第二酱油厂，不只在产量上超过了一万四千多斤，而且质地提高，还节省了六吨煤和十八度电。但各煤矿因受霪雨影响，出煤不到原定计划的一半。不过存煤尚多，本市冬季燃煤，当不成问题。在保卫工作方面，各厂矿都增强了消防设备，充实整顿了消防队，提高警惕。清河制呢厂七月七日电线着火，能立即扑灭。现该厂与燕京造纸厂每周都进行消防演习一次。但有的单位仍存在着严重的麻痹现象。如门头沟煤矿负责保管的同志，连库房存了什么都不知道，经连续发生爆炸的教训后，才引起了注意。
    在树立成本计算方面，各单位都已着手进行。清河制呢厂已经规定以生产单位作经济核算单位，在统一领导下，各部分别负责。但仍有个别单位，存在着严重的官僚主义，接管后至今已半年，对接管的物资还没有弄清楚。
    在工厂管理民主化方面，虽已引起各厂矿领导方面的注意，如门头沟煤矿、化学制药厂，都检查了领导。但是在七月份，除有两个单位成立了工会外，工厂管理委员会还无一处成立。企业局特针对上述情况在会上制定了八月份的工作计划：（一）继续七月份工厂管理民主化工作计划，完成各厂成立工厂管理委员会。（二）继续加强保卫工作，并作初步总结。（三）严格成本计算，先以小厂子作出典型总结。（四）继续开展节约运动，成绩要有数字记载。（五）完成接管以来各厂全面工作汇报，并检查半年生产计划情形。（六）进行各厂矿干部的政治业务测验，以检查并促进学习。（七）研究各厂矿工作制度。
    会上，牟泽衔局长强调指出：一切工作不但要有号召，有布置，而且还必须有检查。工作应力求深入，手续要尽量简化，他批评了有的单位公文旅行达一个月的官僚主义作风，要坚决纠正。贾庭三副局长指示大家：开展民主运动，要及时检查，既不要脱离群众，也不要作尾巴。
