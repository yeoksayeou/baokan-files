Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: TASS, New York: A report recently released by the United Nations Secretariat, titled "Inflationary and Deflationary Trends, 1946-48," points out that during the period of 1946-48, most countries in the world experienced a general tendency toward inflation. In many countries, this tendency developed into open inflation, accompanied by soaring prices and a sharp decline in national real income caused by a reduction in per capita consumption levels.

	In France, per capita real income and consumption were reduced by 15% compared to pre-war levels, and real wages decreased by 35-40%.

	In Italy, per capita food consumption in 1946 was one-third lower than before the war, while the cost of living index increased sharply.

	In India, per capita food consumption was nearly 15% lower than the already very low level of 1934-38.

	In France (with Paris as the base), the cost of living index in the second half of 1948 was more than double that of 1947.

	The cost of living index in Scandinavian countries continued to rise, reaching one and a half times the pre-war level.

	In Latin America, despite some improvements in food supply, the cost of living index continued to rise. Chile's cost of living index in 1948 was 466% of the pre-war level, an increase of almost 30% compared to 1947. Bolivia's cost of living index reached 725% of the pre-war level, Paraguay increased to 450% of the pre-war level, and Brazil increased to 360% of the pre-war level.

	In the United States, despite the emergence of economic crisis symptoms in the second half of 1948, prices continued to rise. On the one hand, national income continued to fall, while on the other hand, the profits of monopoly capital continued to increase. According to the report's statistics, the profits of monopolists increased by nearly 4% compared to the first half of 1946, while the total wages and salaries decreased by 3%.

	In Canada, the cost of living index in 1948 was 25% higher than in 1946, while food prices rose by 40%.

	The facts and figures in the report show a completely different picture for the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, which practice planned economies, compared to the aforementioned countries. For example, in Poland, according to the report, the real wages of industrial workers increased by almost one-third in the year beginning in July 1947. The continuous improvement in food supply and the substantial reduction in prices in the Soviet Union are also clearly evident in the report.

    联合国秘书处报告指明
    资本主义各国通货膨胀
    苏联波兰等国生活上升
    【新华社北平三日电】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国秘书处最近发表题为“一九四六—四八年膨胀与紧缩倾向”的报告。报告指出：在一九四六—四八年间，世界上大多数国家普遍地存在着通货膨胀的倾向。在许多国家里，这种倾向发展为公开的通货膨胀，伴随着这种膨胀而来的，是物价高涨和每人消费水平降低所引起的国民实际收入的急遽下降。
    在法国，每人实际的收入和消费量，比战前水平减低了百分之十五，实际工资减少了百分之三十五至四十。
    在意大利，一九四六年的每人食品消费量，比战前减低了三分之一，而生活费用的指数则已急遽上增。
    在印度，每人的食品消费量几乎比一九三四——三八年期间非常低下的水平，还减少了百分之十五。
    在法国，（以巴黎为基准）一九四八年下半年的生活费用指数，超过一九四七年的二倍。
    斯堪的纳维亚国家的生活费用指数继续上涨，为战前的一倍半。
    在拉丁美洲，尽管给食品的供给有些改进，但生活费用的指数仍在继续上涨。智利一九四八年的生活指数，为战前水平的百分之四百六十六，比一九四七年几乎增加了百分之三十。玻利维亚的生活指数，达到战前的百分之七百廾五，巴拉圭增至战前水平的百分之四百五十，巴西增至战前水平的百分之三百六十。
    在美国，尽管一九四八年后半年出现了经济危机的象征，但物价仍在继续上涨。一方面，国民收入继续跌落，而另一方面，垄断资本的利润则在继续提高。根据报告的统计数字，垄断资本家的利润，比一九四六年上半年增加了近百分之四，同时，工资总额与机关薪金则减低了百分之三。
    在加拿大，一九四八年的生活指数，比一九四六年的水平增高了百分之二十五，同时，食品价格上涨了百分之四十。
    报告中的事实和数字，显示苏联和人民民主国家实行计划经济有着与上述各国完全不同的图景。例如，在波兰，据该报告称：在自一九四七年七月开始的一年中，工业工人的实际工资几乎增加了三分之一。苏联食品供应的节节改善和物价的大大降低，也同样可在报告中显著地看出来。
