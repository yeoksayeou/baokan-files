　　[This Municipality News] Over twenty thousand young workers, students, and youths from government organs and military units in Beiping held a grand rally yesterday (the 28th) at the Huíwén Middle School Square to celebrate the World Youth Day currently being held in Budapest, Hungary. The venue was adorned with huge portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, with countless red flags fluttering beneath the green shade of trees. Giant slogans stood at the four corners of the lawn: "Workers of the world, unite!", "Democratic youths of the world, unite!", "Oppressed youths of the Orient, unite!", "Support the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union," "Oppose the aggressive camp of American Imperialism," and "Strive for lasting peace, people's democracy, national independence, and a bright future for the youth!" These slogans precisely represent the distinct direction of struggle for Chinese youth today.

　　At 2:30 PM, the conference commenced amidst the majestic strains of the Internationale, with Yang Bozhen serving as chairman. Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth and Deputy Secretary of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, pointed out in his speech that the World Youth and Student Festival currently being held in Budapest, Hungary, and the upcoming convening of the Second World Youth Representative Conference, demonstrate the great unity of democratic youths worldwide, marking a great victory for internationalism. He called upon the young workers, peasants, soldiers, and students of China to study diligently, intensify production, learn from the nation-building experiences of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and strive for the construction of New China. Chinese democratic youth must resolutely support the world democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, and unite with all progressive youths worldwide in the international family of peace and democracy, waging a firm struggle against the international reactionaries headed by American imperialism, defending world peace and democracy! Defending the bright future of the youth!

　　Qian Sanqiang, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, stated in his speech that American imperialism has been completely bankrupt politically. From the existing scientific knowledge, we know that the power of the atomic bomb, which American imperialism uses to intimidate people, is limited (equivalent to two thousand tons of explosives), and it is by no means as terrifying as the imperialists and their running dogs have clamored. He further pointed out that there is no so-called "third way"; the Chinese people must stand on the side of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and resolutely oppose the aggressive camp headed by American imperialism.

　　Xu Liqun, representing the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, extended congratulations to the conference and, on behalf of the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Federation of Democratic Youth, the Beiping Student Federation, and the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Youth League, called upon the youth of Beiping to take the lead in concretely implementing the resolutions of the Beiping Municipal People's Representative Conference: eradicate bandits and special agents, restore and develop production, develop culture and education, intensify learning, and streamline and economize. Furthermore, actively support and participate in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples and youths, learn from the Soviet Union's construction experience, and strive to build a New Beiping and a New China.

　　Young worker Li Wenqi, peasant Wang Chunsheng, and student Li Ruhe all firmly expressed in their speeches that they would stand on the side of the Soviet Union and learn from the youths of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. This was followed by thunderous cheers of "Long Live Stalin" and "Long Live Mao Zedong" that resounded through the sky.

　　After the representatives finished speaking, a recreational program filled with youthful vigor began. The "Democratic Youth Collective Gymnastics" was the first program, followed by the "Hoe Dance" and "Bridge Dance," which demonstrated the wisdom of the working class. The magnificent song "We Workers Have Strength" accompanied the lively dance steps, causing the audience to sing along. The bayonet performance by the General Corps of Discipline Enforcers and the glider performance by students from various schools won thunderous applause from the entire audience.

　　At 7:30 PM, Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the National Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, spoke on the issue of internationalism, and films such as "Brilliant Life," "The Adventures of Maklai," "Huaihai Campaign," and "Steel Will" were shown to add to the excitement. Throughout the afternoon, the youths of Beiping were immersed in an atmosphere of excitement and joy, not dispersing until late at night.

　　平两万青年盛大集会
  　庆祝世界青年节日
    廖承志等号召向苏联学习
    游艺节目充满青年人的活力
    【本市讯】北平市两万多青年工人、学生及机关、部队青年，昨（二十八）日在汇文中学广场举行盛大集会，庆祝正在匈京布达佩斯进行的全世界青年节日。会场高悬着马、恩、列、斯和毛主席、朱总司令的巨幅画像，绿色树荫下飘扬着无数面红旗，耸立在草坪四角的是巨幅标语：“全世界民主青年团结起来”、“东方被压迫民族青年团结起来”、“拥护以苏联为首的和平阵营”、“反对美帝国主义的侵略阵营”和“为持久和平人民民主民族独立和青年幸福的前途而奋斗”。这些标语，正是今日中国青年鲜明的斗争方向。
    下午二时半，大会在雄伟的国际歌声中开始，由杨伯箴任主席。中华全国民主青年联合会主席、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会副书记廖承志在讲话中指出：现在匈京布达佩斯举行的世界青年及学生联欢与世界第二次青年代表大会的即将召开，正显示着全世界民主青年的大团结，这是国际主义的伟大胜利。他号召中国的青年工人、农民、部队和学生要好好地学习，加紧生产，要学习苏联及人民民主国家的建国经验，为新中国的建设而斗争。中国民主青年要坚决拥护以苏联为首的世界民主阵营，要和全世界的一切进步青年在和平民主的国际大家庭中团结起来，对以美帝为首的国际反动派进行坚决的斗争，保卫世界的和平民主！保卫青年的光明前途！
    中华全国民主青联副主席钱三强在讲话中说，美帝国主义在政治上已完全破产了。从现在已有的科学知识中知道，美帝国主义借以吓人的原子弹的威力是有限的（相当二千吨的炸药），它绝没有象帝国主义及其走狗所叫嚣的那样可怕。他又指出所谓“第三条道路”是没有的，中国人民必须站在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营方面，坚决反对以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营。
    许立群代表中共北平市委会向大会致贺，并代表北平市民主青联筹委会、北平学联及青年团北平市筹委会号召北平青年要起带头作用，具体实现北平市各界代表会议的决议：肃清匪特，恢复发展生产，发展文化教育，加紧学习，精简节约。并积极拥护和参加中苏友好协会，加强中苏人民和青年的友谊，学习苏联的建设经验，为建设新北平、新中国而努力。
    青年工人李文棋、农民王春生和学生李如蘅在讲话中都坚决地表示：要站在苏联一边，向苏联及人民民主国家的青年学习。接着是全场爆发的“斯大林万岁”和“毛泽东万岁”的欢呼声响彻云霄。
    代表们讲完话后，充满着青年人活力的游艺节目开始，“民主青年集体操”是第一个节目，其次是表现工人阶级的智慧的“锄头舞”和“桥梁舞”；“咱们工人有力量”的雄壮歌声伴着活泼的舞步，使得观众也随着唱起来了。纠察总队的刺刀表演，和各校同学的滑翔机表演，博得全场如雷的掌声。
    晚七时半，由全国中苏友好协会总会筹委会总干事钱俊瑞讲国际主义问题，并演出“灿烂生活”，“马克莱探险记”、“淮海战役”、“钢铁意志”等影片助兴。整个下午，北平青年们始终浸润在兴奋和愉快的气氛中，直到深夜始散。
