　　Nanjing People's Broadcasting Station Broadcast on the 15th: Since the reopening of the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway for two and a half months, thanks to the active efforts of all employees in overcoming various difficulties and repairing the damage done by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, it has completed the huge transportation task of exchanging goods between the north and the south. Coal and grain from North China, Shandong, and Huainan, soybeans, wheat, timber, and a large amount of military supplies from the Northeast have all been transported to Shanghai, Wuhan, and the front lines through this north-south artery. In the past two and a half months, the total amount of goods transported southward by this section has been hundreds of thousands of tons. At the same time, large quantities of cloth, cotton yarn, dyes, sugar, paper, matches, and machinery parts from Jiangnan were also transported to the north. It has played a significant role in the exchange of goods between rural areas in North China and major cities in Jiangnan, and in supporting the liberation war in Jiangnan.

　　津浦路南段全体员工
  　完成南北运输任务
    支援江南交流物资成绩辉煌
    【南京人民广播电台十五日广播】津浦铁路南段自修复通车两个半月以来，由于全体员工的积极努力，战胜了各种困难和修复了蒋介石匪帮破坏的创伤，已经完成南北物资交流的巨大运输任务。华北、山东、淮南的煤、粮食，东北的大豆、麦子、木材和大批军用物资，都通过这条贯通南北的纵脉，运到上海、武汉和前线各地。两个半月以来，该段南运物资的总运输量，计有几十万吨。同时江南的布匹、棉纱、染料、糖、纸、洋火、机件等也大批的运往北方。对于华北农村和江南大城市物资交流和支援江南解放战争，都起了很大的作用。
