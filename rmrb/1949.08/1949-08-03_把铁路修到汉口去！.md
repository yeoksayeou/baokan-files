Build the Railway to Hankou!
    Jian Qun
    Just as Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu issued the order to advance on April 21st, the 2nd Detachment of the People's Liberation Army Railway Corps rushed to Yancheng, south of Zhengzhou on the Pinghan Line, and began to accept the task of repairing the Yancheng-Zhumadian section.
    The Pinghan Railway, which had been deserted for a long time, was overgrown with weeds, and the stones on the roadbed were deeply buried under half a foot of mud. The remaining rails, like starving refugees in the fields, were scattered haphazardly on the roadbed overgrown with weeds. If it weren't for judging from the similar height and width, it would be difficult to see that this was once the famous Pinghan Railway!
    The soldiers who accepted the repair task couldn't wait or endure any longer. Before the materials were delivered, some of the soldiers had already carried the old rails and sleepers home, asking the platoon leader and deputy squad leader, who were former railway workers, to give them lessons. They practiced lifting rails and driving spikes. Many soldiers, after hearing the story of Li Cai from the 8th squad of the 1st company of the 1st regiment practicing hammer blows by drawing circles when repairing the Jinpu Line, drew circles on the ground with chalk or wooden sticks and practiced hammering. Some even created a game of driving spikes: one soldier inserted the spike into the ground, and the second soldier raised the hammer to strike. When the spike was bent or knocked down, the hammer wielder would "plant the spike," handing the hammer to another person to strike. If the spike was driven straight and into the ground, the "spike planter" would pull out the spike and reinsert it elsewhere, letting that person continue striking. They competed to see who could drive the most spikes and who could drive for the longest time.
    The farmers in the villages found the actions of the Corps strange and interesting. "Silly fellows, playing with big iron on such a hot day!" some secretly whispered. However, when they saw the soldiers filling their water jars every day and when they heard the soldiers telling stories of poor people turning over a new leaf, they treated these soldiers like their own relatives, bitterly recounting the hardships they had endured.
    "Comrades, the 'eating poor troops' (referring to the KMT bandit army) harmed us ordinary people terribly when they were in Henan!"
    "Comrades, I only had one son to support the family, and they conscripted him into the army, and he hasn't returned yet!"
    "They cut down the trees! They stole the white flour! They took away the livestock, and you can't redeem them without money!"
    Such words evoked the past experiences of the soldiers from Northeast China, and from painful memories, they more deeply recognized the People's Liberation Army.
    "It's the same, old lady, we used to be like you! After the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army came to the Northeast, we all united and overthrew the reactionaries and bad guys. Now we are all doing well, and it will be the same here. As long as the reactionaries are completely wiped out, all of China will be the same!"
    Outside the villages, the soldiers often encountered mighty and heroic field armies, marching southward in columns along the railway roadbed.
    "Where did you start from?"
    "Beiping!"
    "Where are you going?"
    "Hunan, Guangdong, to all of China!"
    "How long have you been walking?"
    "More than a month!"
    "You've worked hard! We must repair the railway as soon as possible and quickly transport large quantities of grain and ammunition to support you!"
    "Good! We hope you work hard and quickly build the railway to Hankou!" In this way, even before the repairs began, the soldiers received two practical lessons! They knew for whom Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu issued the order! They also knew how to respond to this order.
    When the repairs began, the cadres adopted past experience, assigning a skilled platoon leader to command each company and a skilled railway worker to guide each platoon. Cadres above the platoon level, some mastering rail lifting, some mastering spike driving, some mastering track aligning, they organized so scientifically that when the ties were just laid, the soldiers pushing the wheelbarrows unloaded the rails; as soon as the rails were unloaded, the spike drivers followed closely; then came the fishplate installers and track aligners, group after group, chasing like a revolving lantern. No one wanted to be left behind, and no one wanted to be overtaken. Look! As they worked with intensity and efficiency, they happily shouted rhythmic and majestic slogans!
    "Heave! Ho!
     Comrades are so happy!
     Comrades are so hardworking!
     Repair quickly forward!
     No one lags behind!
     Repair to Hankou!
     Repair across the Yangtze!
     Eliminate the reactionaries!
     Liberate all of China!"
    Under the scorching sun, the soldiers were soaked in sweat. However, after lunch, they rested for less than an hour and began working again under the furnace-like sun.
    When they reached a bridge, the river blocked the train from passing. The bridge-repairing comrades were very anxious! A platoon leader vigorously shouted an inspiring slogan:
     "Heave! Ho!
     Old brothers up front!
     Reached the bridge!
     They can't pass!
     They're waiting for us!
     Comrades, put in some effort!
     Quickly build the bridge!
     When the bridge is repaired!
     Old brothers can pass!
     Repair to Hankou!
     Repair across the Yangtze!"
    "Add oil!" the soldiers shouted anxiously, standing in the river water up to their chests, straining on the ropes. When the rope slipped, the spray splashed on their faces and soaked their clothes.
    That night, when the soldiers saw that the bridge hadn't been repaired, they requested to work the night shift. The company cadre said, "You worked all night last night, two days and one night without sleep, rest tonight!"
    "No! We don't mind being tired, we can't hold up the old brothers!"
    Thus, the cadre couldn't stop the soldiers' enthusiastic requests. As soon as it got dark, gas lamps were lit, and the bright light illuminated the entire vicinity of the Yu River, and the majestic slogans shattered the silence of the entire wilderness.
    When dawn broke, the track-laying team arrived at the bridge. The bridge had already been repaired, and the train smoothly passed over it. Sleepers and rails were quickly laid southward by the soldiers!
    After twenty-one days of effort, this team repaired a total of forty-one large and small wooden and iron bridges on the Pinghan Line, repaired fifty-six kilometers of main line, and four kilometers and nine hundred meters of sidings. On June 11th, they reached the banks of the Huai River and the Hong River near Changtaiguan and Xinyang.
    From June 12th, heavy rain poured down over the Huai River bridge! But could there be anything more important than this? In the heavy rain, the soldiers tied up the large wooden pile-driving frames, carried them onto the water, and under the pouring rain, they shouted slogans wildly, pulling and lunging in the waist-deep water.
    "Go back! Work when the rain subsides a little!"
    "No! We must complete the task on schedule!" the soldiers shouted loudly. Wu Jie, the bridge construction team leader, without wearing a raincoat or a straw hat, climbed up the high and slippery scaffolding and led everyone in shouting slogans in the pouring rain!
    Through the efforts of all the comrades in the detachment and thousands of civilian laborers, the two major Huai River bridges were finally opened to traffic on July 7th. This is the victory of the People's Liberation Army! This is the victory of all of China!
    During the Huai River bridge repair, many people estimated that it would take a month, and many ordinary people said that according to the Kuomintang's previous methods, it would take at least a year. However, the People's Liberation Army not only captured Liu Zhenyan, the principal culprit who carried out the order to destroy the Hong River Bridge, who was the deputy battalion commander of the KMT bandit railway corps, but also completely repaired the severely damaged Huai River bridge in just fourteen days, and also repaired the Hong River bridge in twenty days.
    "Build the railway to Hankou!" This is almost no longer a slogan. From Xinxiang to Hankou, only the No. 2 bridge nine kilometers north of Hankou remains to be repaired, and this slogan is about to become a reality.

### 把铁路修到汉口去！

    把铁路修到汉口去！
    简群
    正当毛主席和朱总司令，四月二十一日的进军命令发出的时候，人民解放军铁道兵团二支队赶到了平汉线郑州南面的郾城，开始接受抢修郾驻（驻马店）段的任务。
    荒芜了很久的平汉铁路，野外横生，路基上的石子，深深地被埋在半尺厚的泥土底下。残留的铁轨，象田野的饿莩似的零乱地散在野草丛生的道床上，要不是从同样的高度和宽度这两方面去判断，真难看出这原来是一段有名的平汉铁路啊！
    接受了抢修任务的战士们，他们真是一点也不能等待和忍耐了，材料还没有运来的时候，战士们有的已把旧铁轨和枕木抬回家里，请铁路工友出身的排长和副班长给他们上课。他们实际的练习着抬道铁和打道钉，有不少的战士听到了抢修津浦线时一中队一连八班李财画圈练习打锤的故事后，一个个在地上用粉笔或木棍画个圆圈，用打道钉锤练习打着。有的还创造了打道钉的游戏，一个战士把道钉插在地上第二个战士就举锤子打，把道钉打歪打掉的时候，打锤的人就栽钉子，把锤子交给另一个人去打；把钉子打正打进土的时候，栽钉子的人把钉子拔出再插到另一个地方上，让那个人再打下去。看谁打的钉子多，看谁打的时间久。
    村庄里的农民们，看到了兵团的这些行动，一个个都奇怪有趣起来了。“傻家伙，大热天还抬大铁玩！”有些人偷着议论。可是，当他们看到了战士们天天给他们家家挑满水缸，当他们听到了战士们讲述着穷人翻身的故事以后，就把这些战士当成自己亲人似的，一个个苦痛地诉着自己所遭遇的苦处。
    “同志，吃穷队（指蒋匪军）在河南的时候，把我们老百姓都害苦了！”
    “同志，我只有一个儿子养家，被他们抓兵抓去以后，到现在还没有回来啊！”
    “大树被他们砍去了！白面被他们抢去了！牲口叫他们牵去了，不拿钱就赎不回来！”
    诸如此类的话，把东北籍的战士们的往事都勾起来，从痛苦的回忆中，他们更深刻地认识到了人民解放军。
    “一样的，老大娘，我们过去也和你们一样啊！共产党八路军来到东北以后，我们大家都团结起来，把反动派和坏蛋都打倒，现在我们光景都好起来了，你们这里也会一样的，只要把反动派完全消灭净了，全中国都会一样！”
    在村庄外面，战士们也经常遇见威武雄壮的野战军，一队一队在铁路的道床上向南走去。
    “你们是从哪里出发的？”
    “北平！”
    “到哪里去？”
    “湖南、广东、到全中国！”
    “走了多久了？”
    “一个多月！”
    “辛苦了，我们一定要早点把铁路修好，赶快运大批粮食炮弹接济你们！”
    “好！希望你们努力，快点把铁路修到汉口去！”就是这样，在没有抢修前，战士们就接受了两课实际的教育！他们知道毛主席、朱总司令的命令为谁下的！他们也知道如何去回答这个命令。
    开始投入抢修时候，干部们接受了过去的经验，每连找一个有技术的排长指挥，每排找一个最好的工友指导。排以上的干部，有的掌握抬铁，有的掌握打钉，有的掌握拨道，他们组织得这样科学，当道木刚铺上的时候，推轱轳马的战士就把道铁卸下来；道轨刚一卸下，打道钉的就撵上，紧接着就是上夹板拨道，一组一组的，好象走马灯一样的追着。谁也不愿叫前面的拉下，谁也不叫后面的撵上。看啊！当他们干得又紧张效率又大的时候，一个个高兴的喊起整齐雄壮的号子来了！
    “嘿！嗨！
     同志们真高兴嗳！
     同志们真努力咧！
     快快向前修嗳！
     谁也不落后嗳！
     修到汉口去啊！
     修过长江去啊！
     消灭那反动派嗳！
     解放那全中国嗳！”
    在炎热的阳光照射下，战士们一个个都晒得象下雨一样的把衣服全湿透了。可是，他们吃过了午饭后休息不到一个钟头，又开始在火炉似的阳光下干着。
    修到了一座桥边上，河水挡住火车过不去了，修桥的同志真着急啊！一个排长就使劲的喊起动人的号子来：
     “嘿！嗳！
     前边老大哥啊！
     修到桥边上咧！
     他们过不去啊！
     就等咱们了嗳！
     同志们努点力嗳！
     快把桥修成咧！
     桥要修好了嗳！
     老大哥修过去嗳！
     修到汉口去嗳！
     修过长江去嗳！”
    “加油！”战士们一个个着急地喊着，他们站在深到胸部的河水里，使劲的掣着绳子。绳子一松的时候，水花溅到脸上，溅湿了全身的衣服。
    当天晚上，战士们看到桥没修成，又要求打夜班了。中队干部说：“你们昨晚打了一晚夜班，两天一宿未睡觉了，今晚歇一歇吧！”
    “不行！咱们累点也没关系，不能把老大哥拦住！”
    就这样，干部挡不住战士热情的要求，当天一黑的时候，瓦斯灯点起来了，明亮的灯光照耀了整个的玉汝河的附近，雄壮的号子声，震破了整个原野的静寂。
    当天一亮的时候，修线路的队伍赶到桥边上来，桥已经修好了，火车就顺利的开了过去，枕木和铁轨又被战士们飞快的铺向南去！
    经过了二十一天的努力，这支队伍在平汉线上一共抢修了四十一座大大小小的木桥和铁桥，抢修了五十六公里的干线，和四公里零九百米的侧线。六月十一日，他们赶到了长台关和信阳附近的淮河＠河两大桥的边上。
    从六月十二日开始，淮＠河桥的上空，大雨淋淋的下起来了！可是，还有比这最更要紧的事吗？战士们在大雨当中，把打桩的大木架捆好，抬到水上，在大雨倾盆的下面，他们狂烈的喊着号子，在半人深的水里拉着扑着。
    “回去吧！雨下小点再干！”
    “不！一定要按期完成任务！”战士们大声地喊着，桥大一中队长吴杰，雨衣不穿，草帽不戴，爬上又高又滑的架子，在大雨淋淋下，领导大家喊号！
    经过了全支队同志和数千民工的努力，淮＠河两大桥终于在七月七日通车了，这是人民解放军的胜利！这是全中国的胜利！
    在淮河桥抢修中，有许多人估计得用一个月，有不少老百姓说按过去国民党那样修法最低限度得用一年。可是，人民解放军不但能抓住了执行破坏＠河桥命令的主犯蒋匪铁道兵团副营长刘振炎，而且在短短的十四天中将破坏惨重的淮河桥完全修复，在二十天中把＠河也修复起来了。
    “把铁路修到汉口去！”这已经快要不是一个口号，从新乡到汉口，只剩下汉口北面九公里的一座二号桥未修复，这口号已经快成为现实了。
