　　【Tangshan Dispatch】The mass movement of workers in the Kailuan Five Mines to abolish the exploitative contractor system and establish worker-managed production cooperatives, which began in June, has now been largely completed after more than two months. Except for a small number of surface contractor groups that have not yet been abolished, 41 out of 57 surface and underground contractor groups in the Five Mines have been abolished. Under the leadership of the Party committees and trade unions of each mine, more than 35,000 miners have established worker-managed production cooperatives, realizing the demands fought for through bloodshed by Kailuan miners for the past six or seventy years. On August 10, the Kailuan Party Committee convened cadres from each mine's workers' committee and trade union to summarize this work. Comrade Wang Lin, Secretary of the Kailuan Party Committee, pointed out that the two major gains of this movement were: First, the elimination of intermediate exploitation, including the "trusteeship system" that evolved from the contractor system. Second, the increase in mass consciousness, manifested in the gradual improvement of production morale and labor discipline in the mines, and the promotion of solidarity among workers. This mass base provides conditions for the establishment of formal trade unions and the development of democratic management in the future. Comrade Wang Lin further pointed out that the primary task after the abolition of the contractor system is to shift the main strength to organizational work, rapidly establish formal trade unions in the Kailuan Five Mines, organize workers, and intensify production. As for the relationship between the trade union and the production cooperative, they are two independent organizations. The cooperative is a mass production organization transformed from the "trusteeship system." Under the condition of signing mutually beneficial labor-management contracts (or temporary agreements) with the mine, it should follow the mine's production administrative management and command and dispatch to carry out production more effectively. The trade union is a class-based mass organization that protects the interests of workers. Therefore, it should not be confused with the nature of the cooperative.

　　六十年来斗争要求今已实现开滦五矿矿工废除包工大柜
    成立自包生产合作社
  　今后将迅速组织工会加紧生产
    【唐山电】开滦五矿工人废除层层剥削的包工大柜，成立工人自包生产合作社的群众运动自六月间开始以来，迄今两月余，基本上已告完成。现除少数井上包工大柜仍未废除外，五矿井上、井下包工大柜五十七家中已废除四十一家。三万五千余矿工在各矿党委和职工会领导下，建立起由工人自包的生产合作社，实现了开滦矿工人六、七十年来流血斗争所争取的要求。八月十日开滦党委会特召集各矿工委及工会干部总结这一工作时，开滦党委书记王林同志指出这次运动的两大收获：一是取消了中间剥削，取消了由包工大柜演变而来的“委托制”。一是提高了群众觉悟，表现为井下生产情绪逐渐提高与劳动纪律的改进，推进了职工团结。这个群众基础，便为今后成立正式工会和开展民主管理提供了条件。王林同志继指出包工大柜取消后的首要工作任务是把主要力量转入组织工作，迅速在开滦五矿建立起正式的工会，把职工组织起来，加紧生产。至于工会与生产合作社的关系，则是两个各自独立的组织。合作社是从“委托制”改过来的群众生产组织，在与矿方订定劳资两利的合同（或临时协议）的条件下，应听从矿方的生产行政管理和指挥调度，更有效的进行生产；而工会则是保护工人利益的阶级性群众组织。因此，与合作社的性质不应混同。
