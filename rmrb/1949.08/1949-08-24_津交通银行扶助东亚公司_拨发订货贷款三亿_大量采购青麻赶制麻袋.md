　　Tianjin Bank of Communications Supports Dongya Company
　　Allocates 300 Million Yuan in Ordering Loans
　　Massively Purchases Green Jute to Rush-Produce Gunny Sacks
[Tianjin News] The privately-owned Dongya Enterprise Company in this city has been producing only 3,000 to 4,000 gunny sacks daily due to insufficient green jute reserves, which is not enough to meet the needs of Tianjin. Currently, new jute is entering the market from rural areas, and to purchase and store a large quantity of raw materials and expand production, the company's负责人 have dispatched personnel to Jinan, Xuchang, Shijiazhuang, Jidong, Jinnan, Northeast China, and other places to purchase green jute, expecting to collect four million catties within three months. Once the raw material supply is sufficient, night shifts will be introduced. However, the company's large-scale purchase of raw materials requires a considerable amount of funds, and the existing capital is insufficient for turnover. After negotiations with the Bank of Communications, an ordering loan of 300 million yuan was agreed upon; a method of ordering and using funds in batches will be adopted, with the Bank of Communications directly remitting the funds to the locations where the funds are needed. The first batch of loans, over 70 million yuan (for ordering 20,000 gunny sacks), was issued on the 19th and has been remitted to jute-producing areas such as Xuchang. Another batch of over 36 million yuan (for ordering 10,000 gunny sacks) was issued on the 20th, to be used for purchases in Tianjin and the vicinity of Shengfang. More will be issued successively in the future. Chen Xisan, the deputy manager of the company, said: "This method of helping factories is truly mutually beneficial: the bank takes care of our various difficulties, enabling the factory to develop production; and the bank does not suffer losses to state capital by supporting the factory."

　　津交通银行扶助东亚公司
    拨发订货贷款三亿
  　大量采购青麻赶制麻袋
    【天津讯】本市私营东亚企业公司，因青麻储量不丰，每日仅产麻袋三千至四千条，不敷津市需要。目前农村新麻上市，该公司负责人为大量购储原料、扩大生产，已派员分赴济南、许昌、石家庄、冀东、冀南、东北等地采购青麻，预计三个月内收足四百万斤。原料充足后，将开夜班生产。但该公司此次大举采购原料，需款颇多，现有资金不足周转，经向交通银行洽妥定货贷款三亿元；采用分批定货分批用款办法，由交行直接将款汇往用款地点。十九日已发出第一批贷款七千余万元（订购两万条麻袋），已汇往许昌等产麻地区，二十日又发出一批三千六百余万元（订购一万条麻袋），用在本市及胜芳附近采购。以后将陆续发出。该公司副经理陈锡三说：“这种帮助工厂的方法，实在是两利的：银行照顾到我们的各种困难，使厂子能够发展生产；银行也不致因扶助工厂，使国家资本受到损失。”
