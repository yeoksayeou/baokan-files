    How to Mobilize Workers in Private Industry and Commerce to Attend Night School
    Yang Shuzhi
    The night schools for workers in the Sixth District were established starting from May Day. Now, after two months, six worker night schools have been established successively, absorbing a portion of the workers in private industry and commerce. In the work of the night school, the most troublesome thing is mobilizing workers to enroll. In this regard, we have gained some experience, which is briefly introduced below:
    First, enlighten the workers' consciousness, connect learning with their own interests, and arouse their interest and desire to attend school. Workers have been ruled by the reactionary派's obscurantist policies for a long time, coupled with the obstruction of some shopkeepers, their desire to learn has been suppressed. Some said: "My family sent me out to learn a skill, not to go to school." "You can still eat without going to school." After a period of enlightenment, comparing the current status of workers in society with that of the Kuomintang period, now there are schools to attend, who took care of us going to school in the past, some have improved their awareness, and activists have taken the lead. For example, blacksmith Wang Baozhong said to others: Reading not only allows us to understand many big things, but it is also useful in ordinary days. If you learn to write, you can write and read letters, and you don't need to find someone else anymore. Learning arithmetic will allow you to keep accounts, and you won’t make mistakes in business. After his repeated explanations, many apprentices have gone to school with him. After the workers' desire to learn is aroused, they are further educated to overcome the obstruction of certain shopkeepers. Sometimes, some masters also disagree with their apprentices attending night school, as long as the workers' desire to learn is aroused, these obstacles can be swept away through persuasion.
    League members play an exemplary role in leading new students to enroll. The league members in the night school are all activists with a higher level of awareness. They not only study hard themselves, but also frequently mobilize others to enroll. Sometimes there are not very good styles in the league members, but they are corrected after criticism. Wang Baozhong, mentioned earlier, often brings new classmates. In addition, Wei Fuyi (a league member) from Runji Soy Sauce Factory was initially criticized by everyone for being out of touch with the masses. Now he has corrected his mistakes. Every time he goes to school, he always calls a young apprentice from a sesame seed cake shop to go with him. Zhao Yonghou (a league member), who sells newspapers, called Li Wenkui, a car repair worker, to go with him every day because Li Wenkui often missed classes. Later, Li also improved. Therefore, some of the new students are introduced by old classmates (especially league members).
    Finally, we want to talk about one point. While mobilizing workers to enter night school, we must also get through the thinking of some capitalists, especially when encountering master-apprentice relationships, we must first explain clearly to the master, because some capitalists still do not understand our policies, thinking that the establishment of trade unions or workers attending night school is for the purpose of dealing with the shopkeeper, so it is necessary to explain clearly to them. For example, the shopkeeper of Deshunqi Shoe Shop originally refused to let his apprentice go to night school. He said, "We have a lot of work, no time." We said to him: "You should also teach your apprentice to be a complete person. If you only teach him how to work, but not how to do business, it will be very inconvenient for him to do business for you in the future. You should let him go to school to broaden his knowledge and open his mind. It would be great if he could have both skills and business acumen in the future." The shopkeeper listened, felt it made sense, and sent his apprentice away.

    怎样动员私营工商业中的职工上夜校
    杨淑智
    六区的职工夜校是从“五一”开始建立起来的，到现在经过了两个月的时间，已经先后建立了六个职工夜校。吸收了一部分私营工商业中的职工。我们在这六十余日里培养了二十多个青年团员，同时同学们的思想都前进了一步。在夜校工作中，感觉比较麻烦的就是发动工人入学问题。在这一方面，我们摸到一些经验，简略的介绍在下面：
    首先启发工人觉悟，把学习和他们本身利益联系起来，引起他们上学的兴趣与要求。工人们因为长期受反动派愚民政策统治，加以某些掌柜的阻挠，学习要求被压抑着，有的说：“我家里是让我出来学手艺的，没有让我上学。”“不上学也一样吃饭。”经过一度启发，把现在工人在社会上的地位和国民党时期比较，现在有学校上，过去有谁照顾我们上学，有的觉悟提高了，积极分子起了带头作用。如铁匠王宝仲对别人说：念书不但可以让咱明白好些大事情，就是在平常的日子也是用得着的，你学了写字就可以写信，看信，用不着再去找别人了。学会了算术就会记帐了，买卖也不致弄错了。经过他屡次的解说，已经有好些学徒和他一起进学校去了。当工人的学习要求被启发起来之后，再教育他们克服某些掌柜的阻挠。有时，某些师父也不同意徒弟进夜校，只要工人的学习要求启发起来，这些阻碍都可以经过说服扫除的。
    团员起模范作用带领新生入学。夜校中的团员，都是积极分子，觉悟较高，他们不但自己努力学习，而且经常发动别人入学，有时团员中也有不太好的作风，但经过批评后就改正了。前面说的王宝仲常带新同学来。另外润记酱油厂的魏福沂（团员）最初大家批评他脱离群众，现在他已改正错误，每次上学时，总去叫一个烧饼铺的小学徒一块去。卖报的赵永厚（团员），因修车工人李文奎上学常缺课，他就每日叫着李文奎一块走，后来李也改好了。所以新同学之中的一部分是旧同学（特别是团员）介绍来的。
    最后我们要谈一点，在发动工人入夜校同时要打通一些资方思想，尤其遇到师徒关系时，更要先和师傅讲清楚，因为现在资方对我们的政策还有的不了解，以为成立工会，或是工人上夜校目的都是为了对付掌柜，所以有给他们解释清楚的必要。如德顺齐鞋铺的掌柜原来就不肯让徒弟去夜校，他说：“我们活多，没空儿。”我们就跟他说：“你教徒弟也要教成个完全人，你光教他做活，不教他学营业，将来就给你做买卖，有许多不便，你还是让他上学校长点见识，开开脑筋，将来又会手艺又会做买卖多好。”掌柜听了，觉得有道理，就打发徒弟去了。
