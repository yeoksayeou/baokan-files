    Large-Scale Enrollment of Children of Workers and Staff
    39 New Classes Added to Elementary Schools in This City
    Temporary Admissions Committee Organized for Enrollment Mid-Month
    [This Newspaper Reports] The Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Industry Work Committee, together with responsible comrades from the Elementary Education Section of the Education Bureau, convened a joint meeting of welfare and propaganda cadres from various state-owned factories yesterday (6th) to discuss the issue of school enrollment for children of workers and staff. Comrade Chen Zichuan, chairman of the Industry Union, reviewed the past failures in recommending children of workers and staff for enrollment, and reviewed the lack of clear guidelines on considering workers and staff simultaneously, and the lack of connection with the Education Bureau, requesting everyone to accept the experience, conduct in-depth discussions, and thoroughly solve the problem of school enrollment for children of workers and staff. Subsequently, a comrade from the Elementary Education Section of the Education Bureau spoke, first pointing out that there are as many as 60,000 out-of-school children in this city, all of which are difficulties left over from the long-term reactionary rule, and the problem of out-of-school children of workers and staff of various state-owned factories must be solved first. The Education Bureau has now decided to add 39 classes to various elementary schools (22 in the city and 17 in the suburbs) to accommodate out-of-school children of workers and staff.

    【本报讯】北平市总工会产业工作委员会会同教育局小学教育科负责人于昨（六）日召开各公营工厂福利宣教干部联席会议，讨论职工子弟就学问题。会议主席产业工会陈子川同志检讨过去介绍职工子弟入学的失败经验，并检讨对工人、职员同时兼顾的方针尚不明确，与教育局缺乏联系，要求大家接受经验，深入讨论，彻底解决职工子弟入学问题。接着教育局小学教育科同志发言，首先指出本市失学儿童达六万人之多这些都是长时期反动统治遗留下来的困难，各公营工厂职工子弟失学问题必须首先解决。教育局现已决定各小学增设三十九班（城内二十二班，郊区十七班），以容纳职工失学子弟。
