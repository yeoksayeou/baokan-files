(By Our Newspaper) General Nie Rongzhen's full speech at the "August 1st" Anniversary and Flag Conferring Ceremony and Military Parade of a certain division of the Chinese People's Liberation Army garrisoning Beiping is as follows:

    This year's "August 1st" is the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Looking back at the past and looking forward to the future, we are filled with infinite confidence in winning national victory and safeguarding world democracy and lasting peace.

    Everyone remembers that from 1925 to 1927, the Chinese people held a great revolution. This great revolution was carried out under the leadership of the Chinese proletariat and its party—the Chinese Communist Party—in political cooperation with the Kuomintang. However, at the critical juncture of revolution and war, the Kuomintang betrayed the revolution, turning the spearhead that was aimed at feudalists and imperialists to slaughter the people. The vigorous great revolution was thus buried by the despicable traitors.

    At that time, the counter-revolutionary current raged and impacted the Chinese people everywhere, but the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people were not frightened, conquered, or slaughtered. They "crawled up from the ground, wiped the blood from their bodies, buried the bodies of their comrades, and continued to fight." The "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising was a heroic attempt to maintain the victory of the revolution with armed forces. The Nanchang Uprising army, due to the disparity in strength between the enemy and ourselves, and errors in its own military guidance and policies, suffered setbacks when it advanced southward to the Chao-Shan area of eastern Guangdong. Part of it, led by Commander-in-Chief Zhu, retreated to southern Hunan and joined forces with the peasant armed forces led by Chairman Mao in the Jinggang Mountains area. This Chinese people's revolutionary armed force has continued to develop ever since, going through ten years of land revolutionary war, eight years of anti-Japanese war, and three years of people's liberation war, until now, becoming the People's Liberation Army with four million people.

    The Chinese People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary armed force of the Chinese people to liberate themselves, has been growing and becoming stronger under the personal cultivation of Chairman Mao. It adheres to the purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, carries forward the tradition of heroic fighting and hard struggle, and, in accordance with Chairman Mao's principles of army building and strategic and tactical thinking, fights fearlessly with powerful enemies at home and abroad. After twenty-two years of arduous and heroic battles, the ferocious and powerful enemies have been defeated by the People's Liberation Army one by one. Today, it has completely changed the face of China, and the Chinese people have achieved the basic victory of the war. The Kuomintang reactionaries’ heinous rule of more than twenty years and the imperialist invading forces of more than a hundred years will soon be swept away by the victorious Chinese People's Liberation Army throughout the country.

    The twenty-two years of the great Chinese People's Liberation War did not come peacefully, but through a difficult and dangerous road, so it is never afraid of difficulties. In its early days, it not only had to fight against the powerful enemies surrounded on all sides, but also had to solve the problems of clothing and food in the battle, and even under the long-term enemy blockade, in order to get some domestic and foreign news, it had to send troops to take a county town to get a few newspapers. Later, going north to resist Japan, in one year, it traveled 25,000 miles, passed through snow-capped mountains and grasslands, with enemies blocking in front and chasing soldiers behind, hunger and disease invading each other, but all this could not frustrate our fighting spirit in the slightest. From top to bottom, there was only one firm belief and determination: "Follow Chairman Mao!" In this way, we finally victoriously arrived at the North China anti-Japanese battlefield, resisted the torrent of Japanese fascist aggression, and finally defeated it. The Chinese People's Liberation Army relied on such a high degree of political consciousness, and the tradition of hard struggle and heroic fighting, to become an invincible force.

    The twenty-two years of the great Chinese People's Liberation War proved that only the Chinese Communist Party can lead the Chinese people's revolutionary war. The Chinese Communists have always stood at the forefront of the firing line for the cause of people's liberation. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, it is impossible to imagine that the war could be persisted in and won.

    The twenty-two years of the great Chinese People's Liberation War proved the greatness and correctness of Chairman Mao's strategic thinking and army-building thinking. Without the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, without Chairman Mao's personal cultivation of the people's army, it is impossible to imagine that the Chinese People's Liberation Army could develop and grow into an invincible force, and it is impossible to imagine that the war could be persisted in and won.

    The twenty-two years of the great Chinese People's Liberation War proved that the Chinese People's Liberation Army must serve the people wholeheartedly and rely closely on the people. The reason why the Chinese People's Liberation Army can fight all over China and never sink in the sea of the people is because it relies on the support and support of the broad masses of the people. The Chinese people have made the greatest contribution to their own liberation cause. Without the high awareness and full support of the Chinese people, it is impossible to imagine that the war could be persisted in and won.

    In the revolutionary ranks, there were people who thought that the revolution could be successful all at once. They did not understand the long-term and tortuous nature of the Chinese revolution. They were not prepared to have two skills, or never prepared to have two skills. Among these people, some suffered from acute illness, and some regarded the revolution as a speculative business. When the revolution suffered difficulties and twists, they quietly slipped away and became deserters in the revolutionary ranks. Some even surrendered to the enemy and became despicable traitors. Today's victory tells us that the success of the revolution can only be obtained through hard struggle, and cannot be obtained by luck. The glorious title of revolutionary cannot be stolen by those who do speculative business.

    Even now, there are still people who think that when the revolution is victorious, everything will be quickly and satisfactorily resolved tomorrow after defeating the enemy today, and the only problem left after victory is how to enjoy happiness. This is the thought of the petty bourgeoisie, which is not in line with reality. Although we will soon achieve nationwide victory, new tasks are before us. That is to overcome the economic difficulties left over by the Kuomintang reactionaries and build a new democratic people's democratic republic, transforming agricultural China into industrial China. This is an arduous task. Various difficulties lie in the road of construction, requiring the people of the whole country to continue to struggle hard. As Chairman Mao said: "To seize nationwide victory is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand miles. If this step is also worth being proud of, it is relatively small. What is more worthy of pride is still ahead." If we want to enjoy this kind of pride, we should prepare to fight resolutely against any difficulties. The difficulties of the past are the difficulties in overcoming the enemy to achieve revolutionary victory, which are essentially different from the difficulties in the road of construction after revolutionary victory has been achieved today. We have overcome all the difficulties of the past, and we have strong confidence that we can overcome the difficulties in the future, and we must overcome them. Happiness is the result of hard struggle, and those who wait for happiness are the least likely to understand happiness.

    Today, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is victoriously advancing on all fronts to eliminate the remaining enemies and liberate all of China. Under the command of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the field armies will mercilessly annihilate the enemies who dare to resist, and plant the brilliant military flag all over the Northwest, Southwest, Guangdong, Fujian, and even Hainan Island and Taiwan, and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive.

    In areas that are completely liberated and undergoing peaceful construction, the People's Liberation Army must cherish and carry forward the fine traditions of hard fighting and heroic fighting of our army, vigilantly stand at its fighting posts, protect national defense and people's interests, and diligently study Mao Zedong Thought, study regularization, study modern military science, and improve combat effectiveness, so that we become a reliable force to protect the motherland's national defense.

    Let us shout!

    Eternal glory to the martyrs who heroically sacrificed for the cause of people's liberation!

    Long live the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War!

    Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

    Long live Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, the creator and commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army! Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

    Long live the Chinese Communist Party, the organizer and leader of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

    在北平某师“八一”授旗阅兵大会上
    聂荣臻将军讲词全文
    【本报讯】聂荣臻将军在卫戍北平的中国人民解放军×师纪念八一暨授旗典礼阅兵大会上讲词全文如下：
    今年“八一”是中国人民解放军二十二周年诞辰。我们回顾过去，瞻望将来，对于争取全国胜利，保卫世界民主与持久和平，充满无限信心。
    大家都记得，从一九二五年到一九二七年中国人民曾经举行了一次大革命，这次大革命是中国无产阶级及其政党——中国共产党参加领导，与国民党实行政治合作之下进行的。然而当着革命与战争的紧急关头，国民党背叛了革命，把指向封建主义者、帝国主义者的先锋，转而屠杀人民。生气蓬勃的大革命，就这样被可耻的叛卖者葬送了。
    当时反革命的逆流，曾经疯狂地到处向中国人民冲击，但是中国共产党与中国人民并没有被吓倒、被征服、被杀绝。他们“从地下爬起来，揩干身上的血迹，掩埋好同伴的尸体，又继续战斗了。”“八一”南昌武装起义，便是以武装力量保持革命胜利的英勇尝试。南昌起义军由于敌我力量悬殊，和本身军事指导上政策上的错误，在南进到广东东部潮汕一带时受到挫折，其中由朱总司令率领的一部分，退到湖南南部，与毛主席所领导的湖南秋收起义的农民武装在井岗山地区会师。这支中国人民革命武装从此一直继续发展，经过十年的土地革命战争，八年的抗日战争，和三年的人民解放战争，直到现在，成了拥有四百万人的人民解放军。
    中国人民解放军，中国人民自己解放自己的革命武装，是一直在毛主席亲手培植之下，成长壮大起来的。它谨守全心全意为人民服务的宗旨，发扬英勇战斗艰苦奋斗的传统，按照毛主席的建军原则与战略战术思想，大无畏地同国内外强大的敌人搏斗。经过二十二年艰苦卓绝的战斗，凶暴强大的敌人，一一被人民解放军打倒了。到今天，已经完全改变了中国的面貌，中国人民已经取得了战争的基本胜利。二十多年来国民党反动派的万恶统治，百余年来帝国主义侵略势力，很快就将被胜利前进的中国人民解放军，在全国范围内扫清。
    二十二年伟大的中国人民解放战争，并不是和平地走过来的，而是经历了困难险恶的道路的，因此它从不畏惧困难。在它创建的初期，不仅要同重重包围着的强大敌人作战，并且还要在作战中去解决穿衣吃饭，甚至在长期被敌人封锁的情况下，为了要得到一些国内外新闻，也不得不派出部队打下一个县城，去取得几份报纸。后来北上抗日，一年时间，行程二万五千里，走雪山，过草地，前有堵敌，后有追兵，饥饿疾病交相侵袭，但是所有这一切，并不能丝毫挫折我们的斗志，上下一致，只有一个坚强的信念与决心：“跟着毛主席走！”这样，我们终于胜利地开到华北抗日战场，抵挡住日本法西斯侵略的洪流，并且最后打败了它。中国人民解放军，就依靠这样高度的政治觉悟，和艰苦奋斗英勇战斗的传统，成为不可战胜的力量。
    二十二年伟大的中国人民解放战争证明了能够领导中国人民革命战争的，只有中国共产党。中国共产党人为了人民的解放事业，始终站在火线的最前线。没有共产党的领导，是不能设想战争能这样的坚持和取得胜利的。
    二十二年伟大的中国人民解放战争，证明了毛主席战略思想、建军思想的伟大与正确。没有毛主席思想的指导，没有毛主席亲手对人民军队的培植，是不能设想中国人民解放军能发展壮大成为无敌的力量，是不能设想战争能这样坚持和取得胜利的。
    二十二年伟大的中国人民解放战争证明了中国人民解放军必须全心全意为人民服务，紧紧地依靠人民。中国人民解放军所以能打遍全中国，在人民的大海中永不沉没，就是依靠广大人民的支持与拥护。中国人民对于自己的解放事业尽了最大的贡献，没有中国人民的高度觉悟与全力支持，是不能设想战争能这样的坚持和取得胜利的。
    革命队伍中，曾经有这样的人，以为革命只要一下子就可以成功的，他们不懂得中国革命的长期性曲折性，他们没有准备有两下子，或者从来就不准备还要两下子，这些人之中，有的是犯了急性病，有的是把革命看做投机生意的人，当革命遭受困难与曲折的时候，便悄悄地溜走了，成了革命队伍中的逃兵，甚至有的投到敌人那里，成了可耻的叛徒。今天的胜利告诉我们，革命的成功，只有从艰苦斗争中得来，是不能侥幸取得的，革命者的光荣称号，不是做投机生意的人所能侥幸窃取的。
    现在也还有这样的人，在革命胜利的时候，认为今天把敌人打倒，明天一切就会很快获得美满的解决，胜利后剩下的问题，就是如何享福。这是小资产阶级的思想，不符合实际的。我们虽然很快就要取得全国范围的胜利，但新的任务又摆在我们面前了，这就是要克服国民党反动派所遗留下来的经济困难，建设一个新民主主义的人民民主共和国，变农业的中国为工业的中国，这是艰巨的任务，在建设的道路上，横着种种困难，需要全国人民继续艰苦奋斗。正如毛主席所说：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步，如果这一步也值得骄傲，那是比较渺小的，更值得骄傲的还在后头。”假如我们想享受这种骄傲，我们就应当准备同任何困难作坚决的斗争。过去的困难，是如何战胜敌人取得革命胜利中的困难，与今天已经取得革命胜利进行建设道路上的困难，有本质上的不同。过去的困难我们都一一战胜了，今后的困难我们有坚强信心可以克服它，也必须克服它。幸福是艰苦奋斗的成果，坐待幸福的人，是最不懂幸福的。
    今天，中国人民解放军，正在各个前线，为肃清残敌解放全中国而胜利进军。各野战军将在毛主席朱总司令号令下，无情地歼灭敢于抵抗的敌人，把光辉灿烂的军旗，插遍大西北、大西南、广东、福建直至海南岛、台湾，活捉蒋介石。
    在完全解放进行和平建设的地区，人民解放军要爱护与发扬我军艰苦战斗英勇战斗的优良传统，警惕地站在自己的战斗岗位，保护国防和人民利益，并且勤勉地学习毛主席思想，学习正规化，学习近代化军事科学，提高战斗力，使我们成为保护祖国国防的可靠力量。
    让我们高呼！
    为人民解放事业而英勇牺牲的烈士永垂不朽！
    中国人民解放战争胜利万岁！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国人民领袖、中国人民解放军的创造者与统帅——毛主席万岁！朱总司令万岁！
    中国人民解放军的组织者和领导者——中国共产党万岁。
