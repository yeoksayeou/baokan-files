　　Economic Relations Between the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    M. Baromov

    The issue of international economic cooperation is attracting more and more attention from the world. Therefore, it is meaningful to examine the principles upon which the economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries is based.

    The Soviet Union's foreign policy is based on respect for the independence and sovereignty of all nations, which gives rise to the principle of complete equality in international economic relations. The Soviet Union's policy does not allow any interference in the internal affairs of other countries, nor does it allow the imposition of unacceptable or unequal conditions on other countries. It is worth recalling that in the early days of the Soviet Union, it abolished the unequal treaties signed by Tsarist Russia with Persia (Iran), Afghanistan, and China.

    The Soviet Union, as a socialist country, has a planned economy throughout its national economy, so it is not only able to undertake certain obligations but also to fulfill them. Faithfully and meticulously fulfilling international obligations is a basic and unchanging principle of the Soviet Union.

    All countries that truly desire to establish peaceful international cooperation are happy to establish economic relations with the Soviet Union. Among them, the People's Democratic countries naturally come first. In the Soviet Union and in the People's Democratic countries, the driving force for expanding production and trade is not the pursuit of excess profits, which breeds the desire to monopolize raw material production areas and markets, but the peaceful development of the national economy and the ever-growing needs of the working masses. The common interests of the countries in the democratic camp in expanding economic cooperation are based on this foundation.

    Trade between these countries has become increasingly important due to the discriminatory policies of Anglo-American imperialism. Currently, other countries in the democratic camp account for 35 to 80 percent of the total trade turnover of each People's Democratic country, while in 1937 they accounted for only 10 to 18 percent. The Soviet Union has consistently ranked first in the exports and imports of these countries. This is not only because the Soviet market has a large absorption capacity and the Soviet Union can supply a large number of goods, but also because there are many benefits to doing business with the Soviet Union. As the Romanian Minister of Foreign Trade, Baladeno, said in the "Spark" newspaper:

    "The implementation of equal economic cooperation between a strong country and a weaker, less developed country is an unprecedented new thing, which is only possible after the appearance of the first socialist country in the world."

    The People's Democratic countries are striving to make their foreign trade promote the rapid development of their domestic industry, transportation, and agriculture. The commodities that the Soviet Union sells to them on mutually beneficial terms precisely meet their requirements in this regard. In order to implement industrialization and mechanize their agriculture, these People's Democratic countries first need industrial equipment and rare raw materials. They can obtain these from the Soviet Union under very favorable conditions.

    The total amount of goods shipped by the Soviet Union, industrial equipment, and valuable industrial raw materials greatly exceeds consumer goods. For example, 70 percent of the goods that Bulgaria has received from the Soviet Union since the end of the war have been industrial raw materials and machinery. The Soviet industrial equipment that Bulgaria has obtained under credit agreements is not included in this figure. Furthermore, in order to help Bulgaria overcome three years of poor harvests after the war, the Soviet Union shipped a large amount of grain to the country; otherwise, this percentage would have been even higher. Now that Bulgaria no longer needs grain, the proportion of metals and machinery in its imports from the Soviet Union has increased. For example, the total trade volume between the two countries this year has increased by 20 percent compared with 1948, of which Bulgaria's imports of iron and steel have almost doubled, non-ferrous metals have increased by 360 percent, electric wires have increased by slightly less than 200 percent, and agricultural machinery has increased by 130 percent.

    Among the industrial products imported by Poland from the Soviet Union are several complete sets of factory equipment. These were provided by the Soviet Union on credit for the assembly of several newly built factories. Among these items, the equipment for a new steel plant is particularly worth mentioning. After the plant is completed, the productivity of Poland's metallurgical industry will increase by almost double compared with pre-war levels. There is also a set of equipment for a large power plant and several sets of equipment for chemical plants and cement plants.

    The Polish newspaper "Kurier Codzienny" commented on these items shipped by the Soviet Union:

    This enables Poland to establish a modern chemical industry, increase its electricity by 500,000 kilowatts, increase its annual cement production by 300,000 tons, and expand and complete its textile industry.

    It can be seen that the Soviet Union's exports are fundamentally different from capitalist exports. Capitalist exports are mostly consumer goods, and they reduce the industry of the countries that accept these exports.

    The characteristics of Marshall Plan deliveries are that machine tools and factory equipment generally account for only 8 to 9 percent. For the People's Democratic countries that are unwilling to fall into the trap of the Marshall Plan, the United States and Britain simply do not provide them with machinery and equipment. Now the United States and Britain have even stopped delivering the small amount of orders that they have already accepted from the democratic countries. Czech Prime Minister Zapotocky already pointed this out last October.

    He told Congress: "It is no longer a secret that we are getting more understanding in the East than in the West today. The fault is not with us. For example, some Americans are preventing the United States from delivering goods to Czechoslovakia—even goods for which we paid gold a long time ago."

    Sweden's sales of iron ore to Czechoslovakia have also been reduced under pressure from the United States.

    On April 8, the British Labor government issued another long list of so-called "strategic materials," stipulating that the export of these materials to Eastern Europe would be subject to strict government control (in other words, a ban). This batch of materials includes twenty-five types of metal cutting machines; lathes; conical steel plates; presses; electronic equipment; certain chemicals; natural and artificial graphite; non-ferrous metals and their ores and finished products, and certain lubricating oils and coal tar.

    The machines and raw materials that the Soviet Union ships to the People's Democratic countries are of decisive value to their economic development. The Soviet Union allows several countries that suffered particularly severely in the war to purchase industrial equipment. In addition, the Soviet Union provides loans to the People's Democratic countries. All of this vividly illustrates that the desire to control the national economies of countries that do business with them, which is unique to capitalist countries, is inconceivable in the Soviet Union.

    The items imported by the Soviet Union also clearly show that the Soviet Union's foreign trade policy is fundamentally different from the foreign trade policies of capitalist countries. As everyone knows, the import policy of imperialist countries aims to make the economies of other countries subordinate to their own economic requirements, forcing the countries that do business with them to only develop a few industries, mainly industries that produce raw materials. As a result, the economies of these countries are distorted and completely dependent on foreign monopoly capital.

    The most desirable thing for the People's Democratic countries is naturally to sell the commodities that their current economic structure can produce, without having to cut their feet to fit the shoes to adapt to foreign markets.

    The Soviet Union is a country that has long since solved the problem of technical and economic independence. The Soviet Union agrees that the People's Democratic countries can use the goods they can produce to repay the Soviet Union for the goods it ships to them, without having to spend an extra amount of capital. This has been repeatedly emphasized by prominent leaders and newspapers of the People's Democratic countries. For example, Czech government minister Jankovcova pointed out that the goods that the Soviet Union agreed to purchase from Czechoslovakia under the December 11, 1947, agreement were very satisfactory and did not require Czechoslovakia to reorganize its economy or spend an extra amount of capital. The Polish newspaper "People's Forum" also pointed out that the goods exported to the Soviet Union were extremely beneficial from the perspective of Poland's export trade.

    Now that the People's Democratic countries have embarked on the road of planned economy, they urgently need a reliable supply of the goods they need and a reliable market for their products. Only the Soviet Union—in which planning has become the law of economic development—can fully meet these requirements, because doing business with the Soviet Union can avoid the risks of the capitalist market and can be free from the impact of devastating crises. It is enough to point out the following fact: 70 percent of the goods that Czechoslovakia currently sells to the Soviet Union cannot find buyers in capitalist countries due to increased competition and fierce market rivalry. The Czech workers will remember very clearly the suffering they endured during the crisis of 1929-1933. At that time, the Czech Republic lost almost three-quarters of its foreign trade, and one-third of its entire industrial workforce lost their jobs. (To be continued)

　　苏联与人民民主国家的经济关系
    Ｍ·巴罗莫夫
    国际经济合作问题，愈来愈引起世人的注意，因此考察一下苏联和各人民民主国家的经济合作究竟根据哪些原则，是很有意义的。
    苏联的外交政策是以尊重各民族的独立和主权为基础的，由此产生了在国际经济关系中完全平等的原则。苏联的政策不容许对其他国家的内政作任何干涉，也不容许把不能接受或不平等的条件强加于其他国家。可以回想一下，在苏联建国初期，它就废除了沙俄与波斯（伊朗）、阿富汗和中国所签订的不平等条约。
    社会主义国家的苏联，其整个国民经济是有计划的经济，因此它不仅能够担承一定的义务，而且能够履行这些义务。忠实地、毫不苟且地履行国际义务，是苏联的一条基本的不变的原则。
    一切真正愿望建立和平国际合作的国家，无不欣然与苏联建立经济关系。其中首先自然是各人民民主国家。在苏联和在人民民主国家中，扩展生产和贸易的推动力，不是对超额利润的追求，这种追求就滋生着独占原料产地和市场的欲望。而是国民经济的和平发展和劳动大众日益增长的需求。民主阵营各国间扩展经济合作的共同利益，就是在这个基础上产生的。
    这些国家之间的贸易，更由于英美帝国主义实行歧视政策而愈益重要。目前在每一人民民主国家的贸易周转中，民主阵营的其他国家占总数的百分之三十五到百分之八十，而在一九三七年则只占百分之十到百分之十八。苏联在这些国家的输出和输入中，始终稳居首位。这不仅是因为苏联市场吸收量大和苏联能供给大批货物，而且是因为和苏联作买卖有许多利益。正如罗马尼亚对外贸易部长巴拉德诺在“火花报”上所说的：
    “一个强盛的国家和一个较弱的、发展较落后的国家之间，实行平等的经济合作，这是一件史无前例的新事物，这是只有世界上出现了第一个社会主义国家之后才有可能的。”
    各人民民主国家正努力使它们的对外贸易促进其国内工业、运输业和农业的迅速发展。苏联在互利的条件下卖给它们的商品，恰恰满足了它们这方面的要求。这些人民民主国家为了实行工业化和为了使它们的农业机械化，首先需要工业装备和稀有的原料。这些东西，它们都可以从苏联得到而且条件极有利。
    苏联所运去的货物总量，工业装备和贵重的工业原料大大超过了消费品。例如保加利亚自战争结束以来从苏联所收到的货物，百分之七十是工业原料和机器，保加利亚根据赊买协定所取得的苏联工业装备还不包括在内。再则苏联为了帮助保加利亚渡过战后三次歉收，曾给保国运去大批粮食，不然的话，这个百分比将会更大。现在保国已经不需要粮食了，因此它从苏联输入的物品中，金属和机器业已增加了。例如今年两国贸易总量较一九四八年增加了百分之二十，其中保国输入的铁和钢几增加一倍，非铁金属增加了百分之三百六十，电线增加了百分之二百弱，农业机器增加了百分之一百三十。
    波兰从苏联输入的工业品中，有几个整套的工厂装备。这是苏联以赊买方式，拿去装配几个新建的工厂。在这类物品中，特别值得提起的是一套新钢铁厂的装备，该厂建成后，波兰冶金工业的生产力将比战前增加几乎一倍。还有一套大电力厂的装备和几套化学厂和洋灰厂的装备。
    波兰库澈柯钦尼报评论苏联运去的这些物品说：
    这使波兰能够建立一个现代的化学工业，使它的电力增加五十万千瓦，使它的洋灰每年产量增加三十万吨，使它的纺织工业扩大和完备。
    由此可见苏联的输出品根本不同于资本主义的输出品。资本主义的输出品大部分是消费品，而且使接受这些输出品的国家消减了许多工业。
    马歇尔计划的交货特点是工作母机和工厂装备一般只占百分之八到百分之九。对于不愿意陷进马歇尔计划圈套里的人民民主国家，美国和英国就干脆不给它们机器装备。现在美英两国连它们已经接受的各民主国家的少额定货，也已经停止交货了，早在去年十月，捷克总理查波托基已经指出了这一点。
    他对国会说：“我们今天在东方比在西方得到更多的谅解，这已经不是什么秘密了。这事错处不在我们。例如有一些美国人士正阻止美国给捷克交货——甚至于我们许久以前已经付了金元的货物也不交来了。”
    瑞典卖给捷克的铁矿，也在美国的压力之下被减少了。
    四月八日英国工党政府又发表了一长串所谓“战略物资”，规定这些物资若要输到东欧，要受政府的严格管制（换句话说是禁止）。这批物资中包括二十五种金属切割机；车床；圆锥孔钢板；压榨机；电子器具；若干种化学品；天然和人造石墨；非铁金属及其矿石和成品及某种润滑油和煤焦油。
    苏联运给各人民民主国家的机器和原料，对它们的经济发展有决定意义的价值。苏联让几个在战争中损失特别严重的国家购买工业装备。此外，苏联还贷款给各人民民主国家。这一切都活生生地说明了，资本主义国家所特有的，控制和它们作买卖的国家的国民经济的欲望，在苏联是不可思议的。
    苏联输入的物品，也清楚地说明，苏联的对外贸易政策和资本主义国家的对外贸易政策，是根本不同的。尽人皆知，帝国主义国家的输入政策，目的在于使其他国家的经济服从它自己的经济要求。迫使与其作买卖的国家只发展很少几种工业，主要是生产原料的工业。结果，使这些国家的经济畸形发展，完全依靠外国垄断资本。
    各人民民主国家最希望的，自然是出卖它们目前的经济结构所能生产的商品，而不必削足适履去适应外国的市场。
    苏联是长久以来就解决了技术上和经济上独立的国家。苏联同意各人民民主国家用它们所能够生产的货物来偿还苏联运给它们的东西，不必另外多花一笔资本。这一点曾经由人民民主国家的知名领袖和报纸，一再强调指出。例如，捷克政府的阳科夫科瓦部长曾经指出，根据一九四七年十二月十一日的协定，苏联同意向捷克购买的货物，很令人满意。而且不需要捷克改编它的经济或额外花一笔资本。波兰的人民论坛报也指出，输出到苏联的货物，从波兰的输出贸易来看，是极有利的。
    现在，各人民民主国家既然已经走上计划经济的道路，它们就极需其所需的货物能源源供给，而其产品则有可靠的市场。只有苏联——在这个国家里计划已成为经济发展的法则——能够充分地满足它们这些要求，因为和苏联作买卖，可以不冒资本主义市场的风险，可以不受毁灭性危机的影响。只要指出下面这一事实就够了：捷克目前卖给苏联的货物，有百分之七十在资本主义国家中是找不到买主的，原因是竞争加剧和市场争夺酷烈。捷克的工人们会记得很清楚，在一九二九—一九三三年危机中他们所受到的痛苦。那时捷克共和国丧失了几乎四分之三的对外贸易，它的全部产业工人的三分之一失了业。（未完）
