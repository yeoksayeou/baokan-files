　　[This Municipality News] Fei Xiaotong, a professor at Tsinghua University and representative of the Preparatory Committee of Faculty and Staff Unions of Beijing Universities and Colleges attending the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, conveyed the spirit and resolutions of the People's Representative Conference at a meeting of all faculty, staff, and students of the university convened by the Tsinghua branch of the Preparatory Committee on August 17th. He began by praising the achievements of the People's Representative Conference, saying, "This conference was wonderful. The emotions and atmosphere of the conference were consistently intense and enthusiastic. As someone like me who is undergoing transformation, I have read a lot of books since liberation, but still have many ideological problems. I can talk about democracy, about coming from the masses and going to the masses, but how exactly to promote democracy? That was still a problem. Now we talk about the people's democratic dictatorship, but how to be both democratic and dictatorial? In the past, we saw more dictatorship and less democracy. How to combine these two things? At this conference, we got a concrete answer." He described the characteristics of the conference, saying, "At first, I didn't think of myself as a representative, but when I got to the venue, the situation was very different. They really wanted you to express your opinions, really wanted you to discuss things. There were all sorts of people in the venue, all elected by various professional groups, not elected by region, because it is impossible to elect by region in the city. First, let's talk about Mayor Ye's report. The report contained a financial report, which clearly stated how much money the municipal government had received and how this money was spent. This has never happened before. As for the method of allocating the money, operating expenses accounted for 40 percent, and recurring expenses accounted for 47 percent. Think about it, in the current difficult economic situation, the government still takes out 40 percent of the money to run undertakings. This is truly unprecedented. In the past, we always thought that government revenue was used to maintain government personnel, but who knew that the situation was not like this." When he talked about the public security report, he said, "At Tsinghua, because everything is relatively stable, we don't feel it too seriously, but from the public security report, we understand that we shouldn't think that everything is over, because the war on the front is still going on. Vice Chairman Zhou told us that when the reactionaries cannot resist on the front, they will secretly carry out sabotage activities." In his speech, he described the change in his own observations during the People's Representative Conference, saying, "At the beginning of the meeting, we thought we were just going to listen to reports and cheer, and then we thought that even if there were discussions, it wasn't that the Communist Party had already arranged and organized everything. However, the result was not like this at all. There were all kinds of proposals, and all kinds of opinions were expressed. The first step was to take out all the opinions, and then everyone discussed them. For example, the issue of tuition fees for private schools was repeatedly discussed by both sides, and the result was unanimously passed by the conference. How can we achieve unanimity? It is by persuasion. Finally, the student representatives automatically withdrew the original proposal." He further explained that the process of reviewing proposals at the conference fully demonstrated the spirit of democracy, saying, "There were more than two hundred proposals in total, and I was also appointed to a proposal review group. Many of the proposals simply didn't know what they meant, or were completely inconsistent with the facts. Some people said to throw these proposals away, but everyone felt that we couldn't do that. No matter what it says, we should list it and publish it. So, more than two hundred proposals were listed. Naturally, not all proposals can be discussed in detail, otherwise, we would have to eat half a year of people's food to finish the meeting." Finally, he talked about how Chairman Mao personally came to the conference to speak and handed the letter from the citizen to the conference, saying, "The first thing that surprised me about this letter was how it could be delivered to his hand. If it were written to Chiang Kai-shek, I don't know where it would have been thrown away. Second, he actually put it in his pocket and brought it to the venue to read aloud in public. This has never happened before! Finally, Chairman Mao said: It is best for you (the conference representatives) to find a way to answer this question. Yes! We are representatives, and we should come up with a solution. The people's big eyes are watching us, so everyone discussed this letter for a long time. This is the real so-called: coming from the masses and going to the masses!"

　　清华教授费孝通传达大会决议
  　盛赞大会高度民主精神
    【本市讯】出席北平市各界代表会议的平市院校教职联筹备会代表清华教授费孝通，于八月十七日在该会清华分会所召集的全校教职员、学生会上，传达各界代表会的精神和决议。他首先盛赞各界代表会的成就说：“这个会开得很精彩，大家的情绪和会场的空气，一直都很紧张、热烈。象我们这样一个在改造中的人物，解放以来，书是看得不少了，但是思想上仍然有许多问题；话是会说了，什么民主啊，从群众中来到群众中去啊，但是究竟怎样来发扬民主呢？还是有问题的。现在讲人民民主专政，但是怎样又民主又专政呢？过去，我们专政看得多，民主看得少，究竟怎样把这两件东西结合起来呢？在这次会上，我们得到一个具体的答复。”他讲述大会的特色说：“起初我不以为自己是个代表，但到会场一看，情形大不相同，真要你去发表意见，真要你去讨论。在会场中各色人物都有，全是由各种职业团体选出来的，而不是按区域推举的，因为在城市中是不可能按区域选的。先说叶市长报告吧，报告中有财政报告，在这里面说得很清楚，市政府收入好多钱，这些钱是怎样开支的，都说得很清楚，这是从来没有的事。至于钱的分配办法，事业费占百分之四十，经常费占百分之四十七，我们想想，在现在经济这样困难的局面下，政府还拿出百分之四十的钱来办事业，这真是空前的事。以前我们总以为政府收入是维持政府人员用的，谁知情形并不如此。”当讲到治安报告时，他说：“在清华，我们因为一切比较稳定，所以不感觉太严重，但从治安报告中了解，不要以为大事已了，因为前方的战争还在进行，周副主席告诉我们，反动派在前方不能抵抗时，就要暗中进行破坏活动”。在讲话中，他叙述他自己在各界代表会过程中观感的转变，他说：“会议开始，我们以为只是去听听报告，叫叫好，后来又以为纵使有讨论，也还不是共产党早布置好了，组织好了，但是，结果却全不是这样一回事，各种提案都有，各种意见都发表。第一步是把所有意见都拿出来，然后大家去讨论。譬如说：私立学校收费问题，双方反复讨论，结果会场一致表决通过。怎样能一致呢？就是用说服办法，最后学生代表自动撤销原来提案。”他又说明大会审查提案的经过，充分表现了民主精神，他说：“提案共有二百多件，我也被推为提案审查小组的一个，其中的许多提案，简直不知道它是什么意思，或者完全与事实不符。有人说把这些提案丢掉吧，但是大家觉得不能这样办，不管它说的什么，我们也应当照样排列出来公布。于是二百多提案都列出来了。自然所有的提案不能一一详细讨论，否则，我们得吃半年的人民饭，才能把会开完。”最后他讲到毛主席亲临大会讲话时，把那封市民的信交给会议上的经过，他说：“这封信使我第一点感到奇怪的是怎么会能送到他的手里，要是写给蒋介石的话，不知道早丢到哪儿去了。第二，他居然放在口袋里，带到会场来，当众宣读，这也是从来没有的事！最后，毛主席说：这个问题，最好是由诸位（大会代表）想办法答复。是啊！我们是代表，我们应当拿出办法来，人民的两只大眼睛望着我们，于是大家为这封信又讨论了很久，这就是真正的所谓：从群众中来到群众中去！”
