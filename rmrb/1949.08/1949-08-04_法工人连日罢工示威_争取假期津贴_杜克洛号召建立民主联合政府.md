    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd - Reports from various sources: French working people have launched a nationwide movement to fight for holiday allowances due to the continued decline in living standards. The movement began with government employees of the government's social insurance department, followed by the French General Confederation of Labor, the Christian Trade Union, and trade union organizations affiliated with the Socialist Party's "Workers' Force," which unanimously demanded that the government grant holiday allowances to all workers nationwide. Strikes and demonstrations have occurred daily in various places. On July 29, workers in various enterprises in Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Saint-Étienne, Nantes, Clermont-Ferrand, and many other cities in France simultaneously held short-term strikes; in Nantes, 10,000 people held a parade and demonstration, demanding holiday allowances. French Communist Party Secretary Duclos delivered a speech in the National Assembly on July 29, emphasizing that the holiday allowance issue is part of the entire wage issue that all French working people unanimously demand to be resolved. Duclos also called on "all workers to unite to establish a democratic coalition government that is the only one capable of saving France."
