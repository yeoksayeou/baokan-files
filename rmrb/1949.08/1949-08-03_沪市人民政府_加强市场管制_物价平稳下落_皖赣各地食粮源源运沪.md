    Shanghai Municipal People's Government
    Strengthens Market Controls; Prices Steadily Decline
    Grain from Anhui and Jiangxi is Continuously Transported to Shanghai
    [Reported by This Newspaper] Shanghai News: Last month, on the 18th, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government adopted new measures to control the market and greatly increased the supply of daily necessities for citizens, achieving results in stabilizing and lowering prices. On the 16th, due to disruption by a small number of unscrupulous merchants, the price of rice in the city's rice market was inflated to 65,000 yuan per shi (RMB, same below), a difference of 28,000 yuan compared to the price of rice in Wuxi on the same day. Flour and cooking oil immediately followed suit, and the price trend went beyond the norm. The People's Government paid close attention to this, and on the same day, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce convened talks with the heads of the North and South Rice Markets, the Grains Market, the Cooking Oil Market, and the Flour Market to discuss abolishing the bad practice of allowing speculative merchants to operate freely by only completing the sale on the day of transaction, not the delivery. On the 18th, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce officially notified the six markets for rice, flour, cooking oil, grains, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth that the delivery system would be implemented immediately and stipulated: "The trading time for merchants entering the market is limited from 8:45 AM to 9:15 AM; entry to the market is strictly prohibited before and after the specified time." The bad phenomenon of merchants freely returning transactions that had already been agreed upon when prices fell was also corrected. The cotton yarn market also specifically stipulated: "All reproduction factories and merchants selling cotton yarn in the market must provide supporting documents from the factories to guarantee that there is no speculative behavior." At the same time, the People's Government ensured supply, and grain was continuously transported from Jiangxi, Southern Anhui, Northern Anhui, Wuhu, Wuxi, and other places, and supplied to citizens at low prices. For example, when speculative merchants inflated market prices, the Grain Company immediately supplied second-grade white rice at a low price of 40,000 yuan, and prices fell one after another. On the 18th (the day the delivery system was implemented), the price of rice stopped rising and started to fall. On the 19th, the prices of rice, flour, cooking oil, and other commodities fell across the board. By the 23rd (Saturday), compared with the previous Saturday, the prices of major commodities in Shanghai fell, such as raw oil, which fell by 7.2%, coal balls which remained stable, Laodong flour which fell by 19.9%, and soybeans which fell by 11.6%. Currently, although the market has not completely eliminated the activities of speculative merchants, it has become relatively stable. Moreover, now that the rainy season in Shanghai has passed, the water level of rivers has dropped, and water transportation is gradually recovering, goods from the city and neighboring areas are continuously being transported, which further guarantees the supply for the entire city.

    皖赣各地食粮源源运沪
    【本报讯】上海消息：上月十八日，沪市人民政府采用管制市场新措施，并大量供应市民生活品，使物价平稳下落，获得成绩。十六日，该市食米市场曾因少数奸商捣乱，米价被哄抬至一石六万五千元（人民币，下同），高出于无锡同日米价达二万八千元之巨，面粉、食油立即随之上涨，物价趋势越出常轨，人民政府对此极为注意，当日市工商处即召集南北两米市场、杂粮市场、食油市场、面粉市场负责人谈话，商讨废除以往当天成交而不交割，放任投机商活动的坏例。十八日工商处正式通知食米、面粉、食油、杂粮、棉纱、棉布等六市场，交割制度即日起执行，并规定：“商人进入市场的交易时间，限于上午八时三刻起至九时一刻止，未到规定时间和超过规定时间，一律禁止入场”，对商人于物价下降时将已经说妥的交易自由退还的坏现象，亦予纠正。棉纱市场还特别规定：“凡各复制厂及客商等在市场内出售棉纱，应由各厂商出具证明文件，保证绝无投机行为。与此同时，人民政府保证供应，食粮源源由江西、皖南、皖北、芜湖、无锡等地运来，低价供应市民需用，如当投机商哄抬市价时，粮食公司即以四万元的低价大量供应次白粳，物价即相继下跌，十八日（即实行交割制度那天）米价即止升转跌，十九日食米、面粉、食油等价格齐头下落，至二十三日（星期六）与上周星期六比较，沪市主要商品如生油下跌百分之七·二，煤球平稳，老东面粉下跌百分之十九·九，黄豆下跌百分之十一·六，目前，市场虽未能完全杜绝投机商活动，但已相对平稳，又当此沪市雨季已过，江河水位下落，水运逐渐恢复，本市与邻区物资源源运来，更充分保证了全市的供应。
