	Nine, Children
	Children are the happiest generation in Soviet socialist society. Families, schools, the Communist Party, trade unions, and the government all show exceptional concern for children: new schools have been built for them, and magnificent children's palaces have been opened. In these children's palaces, children play happily and engage in painting, literature, technology and other activities.
	There are a total of one thousand children's clubs, seven hundred children's libraries, one thousand young natural science research stations, two hundred children's technology research stations, and two hundred and forty-three children's theaters and children's cinemas throughout the Soviet Union.
	In the Soviet Union, more than 1.25 million children live in nurseries, and there are also sanatoriums, convalescent homes and playgrounds specially set up for children. Six million children come to rest and play every year. Every summer, about four million children from the city go to picturesque suburbs for summer vacation and summer camps. In winter, forest schools are opened for children, and the government has taken in 650,000 orphans and sent them to kindergartens for formal education.
	A broad and happy road lies ahead for all children in the Soviet Union.
	Ten, Elections and Memorial Days
	(1) Elections
	The organs of state power in the Soviet Union are called Soviets (i.e., representative meetings). The Soviet Constitution stipulates that all Soviets—from the rural Soviet to the Supreme Soviet of the entire Soviet Union—are elected by universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot. All citizens who have reached a certain age (the Soviet Constitution stipulates eighteen years old), regardless of gender, race, nationality, religion, education, social origin, residence, property status, and past activities, have the right to participate in the elections of Soviets at all levels. Before each election, an election campaign is conducted. Every city, factory, and village holds electorate meetings. At these meetings, candidates are nominated and discussed. During the election, almost all voters participate (reaching 99% of the total). In bourgeois democratic countries, such as Britain, only 75% of the voters participated in the 1945 election; in the United States, even fewer people participated in the 1948 election, only half of the voters.
	(2) October Revolution Day
	October Revolution Day is the National Day of the Soviet Union. It occurred thirty-two years ago (November 7, 1917), which, according to the old Russian calendar at that time, was October 25, hence the name October Revolution.
	The October Revolution overthrew the regime of landlords and the bourgeoisie, eliminated capitalism, abolished private ownership of the means of production—land, factories, railways, mines, etc.—and established a new type of state—the Soviet socialist state. Therefore, in terms of its nature, the October Revolution was a proletarian socialist revolution. It opened a new era in human history.
	For thirty-two years, the Soviet socialist economy has been thriving, with no unemployment; culture and science have been developing day by day; people's lives have become happier day by day; the country has become more and more powerful—all this shows the superiority of socialism over capitalism. Therefore, the Soviet Union enthusiastically celebrates this festival every year, holding military parades and mass parades.
	(3) May Day
	May Day is a great festival for working people all over the world to review their strength. In capitalist countries, the bourgeoisie try every possible means to obstruct and suppress the people from celebrating this festival. Only in the Soviet Union is this festival enthusiastically celebrated throughout the country every year; the capital, Moscow, also holds a grand review of armed forces and a mass parade.
	(4) Sports Day
	July 17 is the All-Soviet Sports Day. Every year on this day, major cities across the Soviet Union hold grand sports reviews. This kind of review also indicates the increasing growth of Soviet national strength. Molotov once said in a speech at the commemorative meeting of the Sports Day:
	“Stalin’s concern and leadership inspire our youth, opening up a free road for the youth to grow and improve their physical and intellectual abilities.
	Our athletes, our youth and their achievements are one of the best signs of our country, its vigor and strength, and its growing confidence in its strength and its future.”
	Eleven, Great Writers
	“I will be loved by the people for a long time,
	I use poetry to awaken kind feelings,
	In our cruel era, I praise freedom,
	Calling for sympathy for the fallen...”
	——Pushkin
	“We envy our grandchildren and great-grandchildren, who are destined to see Russia lead the civilized world in 1940, establish the laws of science and art, and receive the respectful praise of all civilized humankind.”
	——Belinsky
	“How can one not be happy living among such people, how can such people not produce the most perfect characters.”
	——Tolstoy
	"I think that in the entire history of the world, labor has never so clearly and accurately demonstrated its great power to transform people and life, as it has in our era, in our worker-peasant country."
	——Gorky (To be continued)

　　苏联建设图片展览会说明书（续）
  　中苏友好协会总会筹委会
　　九、儿童
    儿童是苏联社会主义社会中最幸福的一代。家庭、学校、共产党、职工会和政府，都对儿童异常关切：给他们建设了新的学校，开办了富丽堂皇的儿童宫。在这些儿童宫里，儿童们快乐地嬉戏着。并从事绘画、文学、技术等作业。
    苏联全国共有一千所儿童俱乐部；七百个儿童图书馆；一千所少年自然科学研究站；二百所儿童技术研究站；二百四十三个儿童戏院和儿童电影院。
    在苏联，在托儿所里生活着的孩子共有一百二十五万多人，还有专为儿童设立的休养所、疗养院和游戏场，每年有六百万儿童来休养游戏。每年夏天，城里的儿童，约有四百万名去风景如画的郊区避暑和夏令营休息。冬天则为儿童开办了林间学校，政府更收容了六十五万孤儿，送入幼稚园，受正式教育。
    苏联全体儿童面前摆着一条广阔幸福的道路。
　　十、选举与纪念日
    （一）选举
    苏联国家的政权机关叫做苏维埃（即代表会议）。苏联宪法规定：一切苏维埃——自乡苏维埃起直至全苏联最高苏维埃止，都由普遍、平等、直接的秘密投票选举出来。凡年满一定年龄（苏联宪法规定十八岁）的一切公民，不分性别，不分种族和民族，不分宗教信仰、教育、社会出身、居住、财产状况及过去的活动，都有权参加各级苏维埃的选举。每次选举之前，都进行竞选运动。每一个城市、工厂，和乡村，都举行选举人会议。在这些会议上，提出和讨论候选人。在选举时，几乎全部选举人都参加了（达总数百分之九九）。而在资产阶级民主的国家，如英国，一九四五年选举时参加人数只有选举人百分之七十五；美国一九四八年选举时，参加人数更少了，只有选举人之一半。
    （二）十月革命节
    十月革命节是苏联国庆日，它发生于三十二年前（一九一七年）十一月七日，按当时俄国旧历说，是十月二十五日，故称十月革命。
    十月革命推翻了地主资产阶级的政权，消灭了资本主义，废除了生产资料——土地、工厂、铁道、矿山等——之私人所有制，建立了新型的国家——苏维埃社会主义国家。所以，按性质说，十月革命是无产阶级的社会主义革命。它揭开了人类历史的一个新时代。
    三十二年来，苏联社会主义经济欣欣向荣，没有失业；文化科学日益发展；人民生活日益幸福；国家日益强盛；——凡此一切就说明了社会主义之优于资本主义。因此，苏联每年热烈地庆祝这个节日，举行阅兵和群众大游行。
    （三）五一劳动节
    五一节是全世界劳动人民检阅自己力量的伟大节日。在资本主义国家里，资产阶级都千方百计阻碍和压迫人民庆祝这个节日。只有在苏联，每年逢这个节日，全国各地都热烈庆祝；首都莫斯科并举行武装力量的大检阅和群众的大游行。
    （四）体育节
    七月十七日是全苏联体育节日。每年这一天，苏联全国各大城市都举行体育大检阅。这种检阅也表示苏联国力之日益增长。莫洛托夫有一次在体育节纪念大会上的演说中曾说：
    “斯大林的关心和领导，鼓舞着我们的青年，给青年开放了一条走向他们体力和智力日益增长和完善的自由道路。
    我们的体育家，我们的青年和其成就，都是我们国家、它的年富力强，它对自己力量和自己将来信心日益增长的最好标志之一。”
　　十一、伟大的作家
     “我将长久地被人民喜爱，
     我用诗来唤醒善良的感情，
     在我们残酷的时代我赞颂自由，
     号召对失足者的同情……”
  　　——普希金
    “我们羡慕我们的孙子和曾孙们，他们命里注定会看到俄罗斯在一九四○年时，将领导文明的世界，创立科学和艺术的法则，并接受所有开化人类崇敬的颂辞。”
  　　——白林斯基
    “生活在这样的人民中间怎么会不快乐，这样的人民怎么不会产生最完美的人物。”
  　　——托尔斯泰
    “我想，在世界的全部历史上，劳动从来没有那样明显和确切地表现过它的改造人和生活的伟大力量，象它在我们的时代，在我们工农国家所表现的这种力量似的。”
　　——高尔基（未完）
