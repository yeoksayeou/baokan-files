　　“毛主席的队伍回来了！”
  　老苏区兴国人民热烈欢迎解放军
    【新华社华中前线十五日电】原中央苏区中心城市江西兴国县人民，热情地欢迎人民解放军胜利归来。当解放军刚进县境时，“毛主席的队伍回来了！”的消息就立即传遍了全县。各村人民都紧张动员起来，烧开水，修道路，当向导，想尽各种方法来帮助解放军。很多居民都自动地详细地向解放军报告敌情。该县东北的五里亭一带居民，在战斗还在进行中，就家家烧水，等待迎接解放军。匪军刚被打退，居民们就迅速地担着开水，涌向村头，迎接解放军。许多村子的居民们并立即自动借出粮食，供给解放军。各地人民都沉痛地向解放军控诉十几年来国民党匪帮对他们的残害。八日，解放军开进兴国城，次晨，四乡农民即将大批蔬菜肉类运进城来。他们都争相使用人民币，使人民币的信用立即提高。下午全县商家即大部开门营业。
