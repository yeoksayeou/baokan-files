　　Simple Replies to Mr. Chai Fengshan:
    If there are only a mother and son in the household, and the son has indeed joined the revolutionary work, a certificate should be issued by his work unit. Then, the mother should bring the certificate, household registration card, and seal to the bureau to collect the property ownership certificate (the property ownership certificate with the son's name). Reply to Mr. Song Yuhua:
    (1) Rent can be calculated in kind or in RMB. Currently, the general situation for housing rentals in this city is mostly calculated based on millet.
    (2) The government does not stipulate the amount of rent per room. The landlord and tenant should freely agree on a fair and reasonable principle.
    (3) The direction of the house, its height, and whether it is a bungalow or a tile-roofed house generally make a difference in the amount of rent.
    (4) Rent should be fair and reasonable for both old and new tenants.
    (5) The government does not stipulate the amount of rent or the maximum or minimum limits. The landlord and tenant should freely agree on terms based on the type, age, size, transportation convenience, and other conditions of the house, with reference to the prevailing market rent and the principle of fairness and reasonableness.
    (6) If the agreement is not proper, you can apply to the district office where the house is located for mediation. Reply to Mr. Zhu Ru:
    It is inappropriate to unilaterally change a rent contract freely agreed upon by both parties after only two or three months, especially since the agreed rent (54 jin of millet for three rooms) is not objectively too high. It is best to adhere to the contract. The degree of hardship in life is difficult to determine without investigation, and it is not an absolute reason for rent reduction.

　　简复答柴凤山先生：
    家中仅有母子二人，其子如确系参加革命工作，应由工作机关出具证明文件，然后由其母携带该项证明文件及户口单图章等来局代领所有权状（由其子具名的房地权状）答宋玉华先生：
    （一）房租以实物或人民币计算均可，现在本市房屋租赁的一般情况，多系按小米计租。
    （二）每间房租额多少，政府不作规定，概由东客双方本着公半合理原则，自由协议。
    （三）房屋的方向与高大矮小以及为平房或瓦房，在房租数额上，一般是有区别的。
    （四）不论老租户与新租户，房租都应公平合理。
    （五）政府对于房租数额以及最多最少的限制均不作规定，东客双方应视房屋种类、新旧、大小、交通繁荣与否等各种条件，参照市面通行租额本公平合理的原则，自由协议。
    （六）协议不妥，可向房屋所在地区公所申请调解。答竹如先生：
    双方自由协议，订定的房租契约，仅经过两三个月期间就想单方来变更是不妥当的，况且所定的租额（房屋三间，原订租额小米五十四斤）。在客观上来看也不算过高，还是照契约履行的好。生活困难究竟至何程度非经调查很难认定，同时也不是减租的绝对理由。地政局
