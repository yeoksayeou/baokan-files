Telecommunications Bureau Answers Citizens' Questions (Continued from Yesterday)
    Three. Given the nature of your business, please explain your attitude towards losses, your countermeasures, and the progress you are making.
    To explain why we are incurring losses and our attitude and countermeasures towards these losses, I must first briefly describe the situation during the Kuomintang period: The telecommunications of the past were disconnected from the masses and were controlled by reactionary organs and special elements. The switchboards and trunk lines of various puppet organizations were mostly unpaid for; the heads of the puppet organizations also relied on their power to refuse to pay for the telephones in their "residences," and the so-called regulations for "telephone suspension" and "removal of equipment" could only be used to deal with shops and a few residential users. The bureau was simply unable to cope with the arrears of the puppet military and political organs, and these losses had to be covered by the puppet government printing banknotes, which was equivalent to shifting the burden to the common people.
    Secondly, during the reactionary rule, the reactionaries only destroyed the telecommunications in Beiping and did not build anything. During the siege, the signal transmission stations, warehouses, and machine rooms outside the city were severely damaged by the bandit troops, and we had to undertake the arduous work of rebuilding them.
    In addition, during the reactionary rule, people with backing could get high salaries for doing little or no work at all.
    After liberation, we have adopted the following measures under the principle of internal economization and external revenue generation, that is, striving for self-sufficiency while taking into account the burden on users:
    (1) Appropriately maintain lower telegraph and telephone rates, not seeking high prices and high profits, but seeking low prices and universality.
    Our telegraph and telephone rates are based on the price of millet, but in fact they are lower than the market price. When the selling price of millet was 40 yuan in April, our telephone rates were calculated at 12 yuan per catty; when the selling price of millet was 68 or 9 yuan in May, we only changed to 36 yuan per catty on May 10th; in early July, the price of millet was on average 18.37 percent higher per catty than in late June, but we maintained the original price in July, striving to ensure that the convenience of telegraph and telephone services could reach all levels of the masses.
    (2) The bureau will separately negotiate and uniformly manage all trunk lines and switchboards of party, government, and military organs.
    This work can increase revenue and make up for losses for the bureau. For various organs, the maintenance and care of these specialized components is also more economical and thorough than unified management by the bureau. In addition to paying rent, various organs can leave the communications work to the bureau to be responsible for, reducing a lot of trouble and improving the speed of communication. Some organs have already completed this work.
    (3) We are doing the same for telegrams for the same reason.
    According to the instructions of the General Bureau, this Bureau has already started negotiations to use lower prices for the unified transmission and reception of telegrams by this bureau. We use "quantity" to compensate for the lack of "price". Now some organs’ telegrams are transmitted and received by this bureau. Other agencies are in the process of negotiation.
    (4) Eradicate sporadic damage to the lines by bandits and special agents, and launch work to protect equipment and defend bureau buildings.
    (5) Save expenses, adjust unreasonable wages, and make the most of waste materials.
    Saving expenses starts with water and electricity, and has gradually and universally begun. Wage adjustments are based on work attitude, ability, and actual work conditions as the standard for wage evaluation. Wages that are too high should be appropriately reduced; wages that are too low should also be raised. This work is now underway. Regarding the utilization of waste materials, the employees of this bureau have already shown a high degree of performance. For example, waste cables are used to make lead sleeves, and waste leather wires are used to make distribution boxes. In addition, the machine officer Shu Chengyin repaired and restored a Siemens 50-line common battery telephone exchange that had been stored for a long time and reported as scrapped, making it usable again. There are many such facts, and the above are just two examples. (To be continued)

    电信局答市民问（续昨）
    三、按你们的业务性质，请说明你们对亏累的态度、对策和进行情形如何？
    要说明我们何以亏累和对亏累的态度和对策，得先把国民党时期的情形概略说一下：过去的电信是和群众脱节的，向为反动机关和特殊分子所把持。各伪机关的交换机和中继线，多不付费；伪机关头子们“公馆”的电话也仗势拒付，所谓“停话”和“撤机”的规定也只能对付商店和少数住宅用户。伪军政机关欠费，局方根本无法应付，这些亏累，只好靠伪府印钞票，就等于把负担转嫁给老百姓。
    其次，在反动派统治时候，反动派对北平电信只有破坏，没有建设。而围城时期城外各收发讯台、仓库、机房、都被匪军严重的破坏，这些艰巨的重建工作，是要我们来担负的。
    此外，反动派统治时，有后台的人，可以拿高薪少办事或根本不做事。
    解放后，我们在对内节约，对外开源，即要自给自足，又要照顾用户负担的原则下，采取了下面的办法：
    （１）适当的维持较低的报话价目，不求价高多赚，只求价低普遍。
    我们的报话价目是按小米折价的，但事实上比市价要低，四月小米售价四十元的时候，我们话价才按十二元一斤核价；五月小米售价六十八、九元时，我们在五月十日才改按三十六元一斤核收；七月上旬小米价较六月下旬平均每斤增高百分之十八·三七，但我们七月仍维持原价，竭力使报话的便利能深入群众各层。
    （２）把党政军机关所有的中继线、交换机，由本局分别接洽，统一管理。
    这项工作在本局方面可以增多收入弥补亏累，就各机关来说，对于这种专门机件的维护和照顾也不如本局统一管理后来得经济周密；各机关除照纳租费外，可以把通讯工作，放手交本局来负责，减少好多麻烦，通话速率还可以提高，现在有些机关已完成此工作。
    （３）电报，我们亦根据这个理由去做。
    按各军政机关个别的设立电台耗费人力财力，在总局指示下，本局已进行分别接洽，用较低的价目，由本局统一收发，我们用“量”多来弥补“价低”的不足；用尽一切可能的方法来开源，不在一般用户身上转念头。现在有些机关的电报都由本局收发了。其他机关正接洽中。
    （４）根绝匪帮特务对线路的零星破坏，并展开爱护器材和保卫局舍工作。
    （５）节省开支调整不合理的工资，尽量的废物利用。
    节省开支，由水电着手，已经逐渐的普遍的展开了。调整工资，按照劳动态度、能力及实际工作的情形来做评议工资的标准，过高的要适当的减低；过低的也要提高。现在这个工作，正在展开。关于废物利用，本局职工已有了高度的表现，比如利用废电缆来改做铅套管，废皮线改做分线筒，还有机务佐舒承荫把久存早已报废料的西门子五十门共电式交换机一台，修配完整，能再应用。象这种事实很多，上面仅是两个例子而已。（未完）
