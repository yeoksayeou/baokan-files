Introducing the Opera "Meritorious Service"
　　Bai Sheng

The play "Meritorious Service", which sings the praises of the strength of the working class, has been performed in Beiping and Changxindian for sixteen consecutive times, with an audience of over 35,800 people. It was created by the Northeast Cultural and Educational Work Team, under the guidance and assistance of the workers, and after nine revisions. It has been used to entertain representatives from various regions attending the Literary and Art Workers Congress, actors from cultural and art troupes, railway workers from Changxindian, representatives of the Preparatory Committee for the New Political Consultative Conference, representatives of the Preparatory Committee for the National Educational Workers' Conference, and representatives of the National Trade Union Work Conference. Recently, the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Municipal Cultural Committee, in response to the enthusiastic invitations of workers from various factories in Beiping, students and teachers in summer schools, have decided to continue performing it in the city. Indeed, the performance of "Meritorious Service" deserves our special attention and emphasis, as many workers have said, "The direction of 'Meritorious Service' is the direction we should all strive for in the future."

The story development of "Meritorious Service" is as follows: A state-owned iron factory in Harbin receives an urgent mission to support the front lines, requiring them to complete 1,000 shovels and 500 picks within ten days. "A lot of work, little time, broken tools, and a lack of materials," this difficulty immediately confronts them. So, the factory director and the chairman of the trade union seek help from the old hero Zhao Haiming (leader of the second group). The old hero immediately convenes a group meeting. Everyone is very active, determined to overcome difficulties and complete the task. However, Gao Sheng (a worker in the factory with backward thinking) has no confidence in this task, behaving sloppily at work and often complaining. To increase production, the old hero stays up all night researching and creating new tools. After solving the tool problem, everyone discusses and comes up with the method of "waste iron turning over," solving the difficulty of material shortage. The worker Gao Sheng also, through everyone's efforts, help, and encouragement during this work, becomes aware of his shortcomings and actively participates in production. Finally, through the efforts of all the workers, the ten-day task is completed in nine days, and they are awarded the "Model Group" red flag.

They began writing this script in the spring of 1948, when, under the leadership of the Party, Harbin factories launched a production emulation campaign. Factories actively increased production and strived to become model workers, creating a very enthusiastic working atmosphere. At that time, the Northeast Cultural and Educational Team was working in the factories, learning and collecting materials in the Harbin Railway Factory. After more than a month of factory life, they gradually became one with the workers, not only witnessing their production enthusiasm but also experiencing the changes in their thoughts and feelings and learning the workers' language.

Initially, the theme of "Meritorious Service" was to write about backward workers. Later, after many people offered suggestions, the second revision focused on writing positively about workers, with the theme of praising the active efforts of the vast majority of workers and the great strength of the working class, while portraying backward workers as a problem to be addressed. They wrote while consulting with the workers, working hard and earnestly, honestly accepting the correct opinions of the workers, and rewriting again and again without getting tired. During rehearsals, they invited many workers to help with the directing. In particular, many realistic labor scenes in the play, such as forging, grinding grinding wheels, and welding, were learned from the workers and corrected with their help at any time. After this script was performed at the Sixth National Labor Congress, it underwent a broader assessment and transformation by the masses of workers. At that time, it was performed in Harbin for seventeen consecutive times and was unanimously supported by the audience. After seeing it, the Harbin railway workers specially organized a discussion. Later, it continued to be performed in Shenyang, gaining rapid promotion. When Shenyang celebrated "May Day" Labor Day, eleven factories and units rehearsed "Meritorious Service." The Shenyang Workers' Daily also held a symposium to discuss it, and the Shenyang Workers' Political University made "Meritorious Service" a textbook. In this way, they went to Fushun and Anshan, giving demonstration performances in Fushun Coal Mine and Anshan Iron and Steel Company, etc., performing more than twenty times in a row, all with good results.

After the performance in Anshan, the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department convened a "Meritorious Service" symposium with hundreds of people. Everyone believed that this play was a direction that should be promoted, so that all parties pay attention to it. Because it solved some ideological problems among the workers, it also put forward the correct production attitude and helped the factory's administrative cadres to more deeply understand how to follow the mass line. After watching "Meritorious Service", the workers unanimously believed that if they did not work hard, they would be letting down the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

This time, in order to participate in the performance of the National Literary and Art Workers Congress, they arrived in Beiping on July 6. After arriving in the city, in order to introduce the labor enthusiasm of the Northeast workers in the production emulation movement to the workers of North China, they went to Changxindian to perform on July 11. After the first performance, the workers immediately caused a sensation. They felt so close to it, unanimously saying: "It turns out this play is so exciting! Seeing you performing so enthusiastically on stage, we can't wait to run up and help you!"

Returning to Beiping from Changxindian, their performances for the Literary and Art Workers Congress and recent performances for workers and students have attracted much discussion and attention. It is considered a successful script about workers at present, grasping the vivid aspects of workers' lives and making people see the joy of labor. The whole play is full of new vitality, overflowing with revolutionary enthusiasm. The play shows the collective strength of the working class, educates the workers themselves, and raises issues such as the implementation of democratic management in factories, which indicates the direction of efforts for factory administration and trade union work.

What does this opera tell us? First of all, it tells us that launching a production emulation movement in factories is a good way to improve production, and to launch an emulation movement, it is necessary to follow the mass line - inspiring the workers' sense of ownership. As long as the workers become conscious, they can overcome all difficulties. Secondly, the transformation of backward workers should rely on the power of the masses, relying on the self-education of the workers; anyone who attempts to replace this education with coercive orders and simple punishments will suffer failure. In addition, in terms of creation, the creation process of "Meritorious Service" tells us that we must live with the workers, be familiar with their work and thoughts and feelings, in order to produce better works. There is no shortcut.

    介绍歌剧“立功”
    柏生
    由东北文化教育工作队，接受工人的指导与帮助，经过九次修改的歌颂工人阶级力量的剧作“立功”已连续在北平、长辛店上演了十六次，观众达三万五千八百人以上。曾经招待了文代大会的各地代表及文工团演员，长辛店铁路工人，新政协筹备会代表，全国教育工作者代表会议筹备会代表，以及全国工会工作会议代表。最近北平市总工会与市文委会应北平各工厂工人及暑期学习学生、教员的热烈邀请，他们决定在平继续出演。的确，“立功”的演出是值得我们大家特别关心与重视的，正如许多工人群众所说，“立功”的方向，正是大家今后要努力的方向。
    “立功”的故事发展是这样的：在哈尔滨某公营铁工厂，接到紧急支援前线的任务，要在十天之内完成一千把铁锹，五百把镐头。“活计多，时间少，工具坏，材料缺，”这个困难立刻摆在他们面前。于是厂长和工会主任便找老英雄赵海明（第二组组长）想办法。老英雄马上召开小组会，大家非常积极，坚决要克服困难，完成任务。而高升（厂里一个思想落后的工友）对这任务没有信心，工作中表现吊儿郎当，爱发牢骚。老英雄为了提高产量，连夜不睡觉的研究创造了新的工具。工具问题解决后，又经大家互相研讨，想出了“废铁翻身”的办法，解决了材料缺的困难。工友高升也在这次工作中经过大家努力帮助与鼓励，觉悟过来，积极的参加了生产。最后，经全体工友的突击，十天的任务九天圆满完成，他们得到了“模范组”的红旗。
    他们开始创作这个剧本，那是一九四八年春天，在党的领导下，哈尔滨各工厂展开了生产立功运动。各工厂积极提高生产，争取立功模范，工作情绪非常热烈。而当时东北文教队正到工厂工作，在哈尔滨铁路工厂里学习和搜集材料。经过一个多月的工厂生活，与工人逐渐打成了一片，不仅看到了他们生产的热潮，更体会了他们思想感情的变化，并学会了工人的语言。
    最初，“立功”的主题是写落后工人，后来经过许多人提意见，进行了第二次的修改，抓住了正面写工人，以歌颂绝大部分工人的积极努力与工人阶级伟大力量为主题，而把落后工人的描写当作一个问题提出来。他们一面写一面找工人去研究，刻苦认真，老实的接受工人的正确意见，毫不厌烦地一次再一次的改写。排演时，请许多工人来帮助导演，尤其是剧中的许多真实劳动场面，比如打铁、磨砂轮、电焊等，都是向工人学习得来，随时由工人帮助纠正。这个剧本在第六次全国劳动大会上演出后，经过了更广泛的工人群众的鉴定、和帮助改造，当时在哈尔滨连续上演了十七次，得到观众一致拥护。哈尔滨铁路工人看后，特别组织了讨论。以后继续到沈阳演出，获得很快的推广。沈阳庆祝“五一”劳动节时，有十一个工厂单位都排演了“立功”，沈阳工人日报也召开座谈会讨论，沈阳的工人政治大学并把“立功”当成了课本。就这样，他们更到了抚顺和鞍山，在抚顺煤矿、鞍山制钢公司等示范演出，一连演了二十多次，都获得良好效果。
    在鞍山演出后，市委宣传部召开数百人的“立功”座谈会。大家认为这剧是一个方向，应推广，使各方重视。因为它解决了工人中若干思想问题，同时提出了正确的生产态度并帮助工厂的行政干部，更深刻地体会了怎样走群众路线。工人看过“立功”，一致认为再不努力劳动，就对不起共产党和毛主席。
    这次为了参加全国文代大会的演出，七月六日他们便到了北平。来平后，为了把东北工人在生产立功运动中的劳动热情，介绍给华北的工人们，七月十一日他们又去长辛店演出。第一次演出后，工人们立即轰动起来，他们感到那么亲切，一致说：“原来这戏这么带劲！看见你们在上面演的那样起劲，我们恨不得也跑上去帮助你们干呀！”
    从长辛店回到北平，他们为文代大会的演出，直至最近招待工人学生的演出，引起许多人的讨论和注意，认为这是目前写工人的一个成功的剧本，把工人生活中的生动的地方都抓住了，使人看到劳动的愉快。全剧充满了新的生命力，到处洋溢着革命的热情，剧中表现了工人阶级的集体力量，教育了工人自己，提出了工厂应实行民主管理等问题，这又给工厂行政与工会的工作指示了努力的方向。
    这个歌剧告诉我们些什么呢？他首先告诉我们：在工厂中发动生产立功运动是一种提高生产的好方法，而要发动立功运动则必须走群众路线——启发工人主人翁的自觉。只要工人自觉起来，即能克服一切困难。其次，对落后工友的改造，应该依靠群众的力量，依靠工人的自我教育；谁企图用强迫命令与简单处罚的办法代替这种教育，必会遭受失败。此外，在创作上“立功”的创作过程告诉我们：必须与工人生活在一起，熟悉他们的工作与思想感情，才能产生较好的作品。想找捷径是没有的。
