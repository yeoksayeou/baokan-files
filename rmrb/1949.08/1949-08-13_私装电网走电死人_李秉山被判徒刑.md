    Illegally Installed Electric Fence Causes Death by Electrocution
    Li Bingshan Sentenced to Imprisonment
    [This newspaper dispatch] Li Bingshan, disregarding electricity usage regulations, privately installed an electric fence, and the People's Court sentenced him to two years of imprisonment. Li Bingshan is a manual laborer. He kept eight chicks at home, four of which were eaten by wild cats. Angered, he wanted to electrocute the wild cats, so he privately installed an electric fence on the south wall of his house. He connected it to the power switch in the north room with old black insulated wire. Carelessly, the black insulated wire touched the iron wire used for drying clothes in the yard. Just then, Niu Linzhang, the management section chief of our 207th Division, was hanging clothes and was electrocuted to death. The aforementioned criminal facts have been confessed by Li Bingshan in court. The court, considering that he is a simple worker with a lack of knowledge about electricity, leniently reduced his sentence and sentenced him to two years of imprisonment.

    私装电网走电死人
    李秉山被判徒刑
    【本报讯】李秉山不守用电规章，私自装设电网，人民法院判处其有期徒刑二年。李秉山系一扛活工人，家中喂有小鸡八只被野猫吃掉四只，因气愤想用电把野猫电死，私自在家南墙上装一电网，从北屋电门处用旧黑皮线联起将电沟通，因为不小心把黑皮线和院中晒衣服的铁丝挨到一起，正有我二○七师管理科长牛林章晒晾衣服，触电身死。上列犯罪事实业经李秉山在法院坦白承认。法院念其是一个纯朴工人，缺乏电的知识，故予酌情减刑，判有期徒刑二年。  （光）
