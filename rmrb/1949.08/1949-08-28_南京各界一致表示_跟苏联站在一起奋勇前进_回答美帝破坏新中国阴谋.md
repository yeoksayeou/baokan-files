Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 27th: People from all democratic parties, people's organizations, and science and education circles in Nanjing gathered on the afternoon of the 22nd to discuss the American White Paper. More than 50 people, including Chen Mingshu and Zhu Yunshan, attended. Shi Ximin, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a speech first. He pointed out that the "White Paper" admitted to supplying the Kuomintang reactionary government with "more than 50 percent of monetary expenditures" and "most of the military supplies," supporting "reactionary elements who have lost the support of the people" and are "no different from past warlords," slaughtering the Chinese people, but in the end, they could not help but admit their shameful failure helplessly. This is a good education for some people who cannot see the great power of the people and therefore suffer from "fear of America." He particularly pointed out: Nanjing was once the center of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and American imperialist rule in China. Some people, especially some intellectuals, have unclear understanding and illusions about American imperialism. Therefore, it is necessary to educate and persuade them with the White Paper so that they stand on the side of the people and do not fall for it. He hoped that everyone would use the "White Paper" as a textbook to educate these people. Then, representatives from all walks of life present spoke. Zhu Yunshan of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang said: "American imperialism is now trying its best to create so-called 'democratic individualists' in an attempt to shake and divide the democratic revolutionary camp. This is absolutely impossible. We must pay attention to vigilance, and step up the elimination of the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries. All democratic parties should unite under the leadership of Chairman Mao and advance courageously together to answer the new conspiracy of American imperialism." Li Peilin, a professor at Nanjing University, said: "American imperialism used 4 billion US dollars to arm Chiang Kai-shek, the public enemy of the Chinese people, and slaughter the Chinese people. Can we be friends with such imperialism? The American imperialist blockade is a good opportunity to get rid of imperialist shackles and rely on our own efforts. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, there are no insurmountable difficulties." Wu Zaidong, a researcher at the Academia Sinica, said: "We stand with the Soviet Union and accept the progressive things of the Soviet Union, just like accepting Edison's electrical inventions. Isn't it much better for us to use electric lights than oil lamps now? Why can't we learn from the Soviet Union?" Wu Zuxiang, a professor at Jinling Women's University, said: "So-called 'democratic individualists,' if they do not quickly abandon their illusions about American imperialism, will fall into the trap of imperialism and become tools of imperialism. People with this kind of thinking should quickly wake up and be careful not to be fooled." Ji Fang of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party said: "The White Paper gives the Chinese people a good inspiration: Imperialism will not be reconciled to the victory of the Chinese people. We must beware of the new conspiracy of American imperialism." Chen Mingshu of the Sanmin Zhuyi Comrades Association said: "American imperialism is afraid that we will lean to one side. Today I solemnly reply to American imperialism: We started leaning to one side as early as the 13th year of the Republic of China. We have long been willing to advance towards the goal of socialism under the leadership of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party. Our attitude is very clear and firm, and any provocation and alienation will fail." Lu Huinian, a representative of the Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, said: "Chinese women have a double hatred for the crimes of American imperialism in invading China. Insults such as the Shen Chong case in Beiping and the Jingming Building case in Hankou are too numerous to mention. Chinese women will never forget these insults and hatreds. We must use facts to educate and persuade all those who have illusions about American imperialism, so that they will lean towards the people and sever any connection with imperialism." Shu Zehu, a representative of the Nanjing Student Federation, said: "In Nanjing, which has been under the long-term rule of the Kuomintang and imperialism, some people have a blindly high estimate of the strength of American imperialism. The White Paper, which cannot but frankly admit the failure of interfering in China's internal affairs, has given a very beneficial lesson to those who do not believe in the power of the people and are blindly afraid of American imperialism." Ouyang Zhiwu of the Nanjing Branch of the China Democratic League said: "Only the Soviet Union is truly helping our Chinese people. We are not wrong to stand with the Soviet Union at all. If we still have any illusions about imperialism, it would be a great mistake." Writer Xiao Yiwu said: "Only those who do not see the greatness of the people's power have illusions about American imperialism. American imperialism's attempt to use 'democratic individualists' to divide us will inevitably fail."

　　南京各界一致表示
    跟苏联站在一起奋勇前进
  　回答美帝破坏新中国阴谋
    【新华社南京二十七日电】南京市各民主党派、各人民团体及科学、教育界人士于二十二日下午集会座谈美国白皮书，到陈铭枢、朱＠山等五十余人。首由中共南京市委会宣传部副部长石西民致词，他指出：“白皮书”承认供给了国民党反动政府“金钱支出百分之五十以上”和“军需品的大部分”，支持“已失去人民支持”、“与过去军阀并无区别的反动分子”，屠杀中国人民，但到头来还不能不无可奈何地供认自己可耻的失败。这对于某些看不见人民的伟大力量，因而患“恐美病”的人，是一个很好的教育。他特别指出：南京曾是蒋介石匪帮与美帝国主义在华统治的中心，某些人，特别是在知识分子中间的某些人，对美帝国主义认识不清，存有幻想，因此，以白皮书来教育、说服他们，使他们站在人民方面，不去上当，是很有必要的。他希望大家都拿“白皮书”作课本，向这些人进行教育。接着由到会各界代表发言。国民党革命委员会朱＠山说：“美帝国主义现在极力制造所谓‘民主个人主义者’，想以此来动摇分化民主革命阵营，这是绝对不可能的，我们要注意警惕，加紧消灭国民党反动派的残余势力，各民主党派更应团结在毛主席的领导下，一齐奋勇前进，以回答美帝的新阴谋。”南京大学校授李佩林说：“美帝国主义用四十亿美金武装中国人民公敌蒋介石，屠杀中国人民，难道我们能和这样的帝国主义做朋友吗？美帝封我们，正是脱离帝国主义束缚，自力更生的好机会。在中国共产党领导下，没有不可克服的困难。”中央研究院研究员吴在东说：“我们跟苏联站在一起，接受苏联进步的东西，正如接受爱迪生的电气发明一样。我们现在用电灯不是比油灯好得多么？为什么不能跟着苏联学习呢？”金陵女子大学教授吴组缃说：“所谓‘民主个人主义者’，若不赶快丢掉对美帝国主义的幻想，就会落入帝国主义的圈套，成为帝国主义的工具。有这种思想的人，应迅速觉悟，小心上当。”农工民主党季方说：“白皮书给中国人民一个很好的启示；帝国主义对中国人民的胜利，是不会甘心的，我们要提防美帝国主义的新阴谋。”三民主义同志联合会陈铭枢说：“美帝国主义害怕我们一面倒，我今天严正地答复美帝国主义：我们早在民国十三年就开始一面倒了，我们老早愿意在苏联与中国共产党的领导下，向着社会主义的目标前进。我们这种态度非常鲜明坚定，任何挑拔离间都要落空。”市民主妇联代表陆慧年说：“中国妇女对美帝国主义侵华罪行，有着双重仇恨，象北平沈崇案、汉口景明大楼案之类的侮辱，真是罄竹难书的。中国妇女永远不会忘记这些侮辱和仇恨，我们要以事实来教育和说服一切对美帝国主义存有幻想的人，使他们向人民靠拢，与帝国主义断绝任何牵连。”南京学联代表舒泽湖说：“在国民党与帝国主义长期统治下的南京，有一部分人对美帝国主义力量存在着盲目的过高的估计，不能不坦白承认干涉中国内政失败的白皮书，对于那些不相信人民力量、一味恐惧美帝国主义的人，上了很有益的一课。”民盟南京支部欧阳执无说：“真正帮助我们中国人民的只有苏联，我们和苏联站在一起一点没有错的。如果还对帝国主义存有任何幻想，则是莫大的错误。”作家萧亦五说：“看不到人民力量伟大的人才对美帝国主义存有幻想，美帝国主义企图以‘民主个人主义者’来分化我们，必然遭到失败。”
