Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 5th: TASS, New York, August 3rd: Many American conservatives, who often support foreign aggression policies, have expressed fear and unease regarding the scope of the government's plan to arm Western European countries. Walter Lippmann, a commentator for the New York Herald Tribune, complained that the government's bill is in effect a "blank check for universal use," allowing Truman and his appointed officials to secretly decide when they believe intervention is warranted anywhere in the world, and placing the burden of obligations on the United States in all parts of the globe. Lippmann pointed out that, according to this bill, the president can arm not only recognized governments but also groups or factions. This bill grants the president excessive power that could drag the United States into ventures. Lippmann suggested withdrawing the current bill and drafting a new one.

The Wall Street Journal declared: Most of the criticisms of the government's bill only suggest reducing the president's power and narrowing the scope of the arms bill, but they miss the main point – whether the U.S. government should even be conducting an arms program. The newspaper condemned the government for playing "tricks," initially pretending that the arms bill was unrelated to the Atlantic Pact, but immediately after the Senate approved the pact, it submitted the arms bill to Congress.

Compass reporter I.F. Stone continued to expose the arms bill, stating that if Congress approves this plan, it will strike a blow to Britain's recovery. Stone pointed out that Britain's military spending has already severely hindered its ability to increase production and improve living standards.

    美保守分子着了慌
    抱怨武装法案
    【新华社北平五日电】塔斯社纽约三日讯：美国许多经常支持对外侵略政策的保守分子，对于政府要求武装西欧等国计划包括的范围，表示恐惧与不安。纽约先驱论坛报评论家李普曼抱怨说：政府的法案实际上就是一张“普遍使用的特许状，在杜鲁门及其任命的官员秘密地决定他们认为可以进行干涉的时候，就可以干涉全球任何一个地方，并使美国在全世界各地负担义务”。李普曼指出：根据这个法案，总统不仅可以武装被承认的政府，甚至可以武装集团或派系。这个法案授予总统可能将美国牵入冒险中的过大权力。李普曼建议撤消现在的法案，制定一新法案。
    华尔街日报宣称：对于政府法案的大部分批评，只是建议削减总统的权力和缩小武装法案的范围，但是遗漏了主要的一点——美国政府究竟是否应该进行武装计划。该报谴责政府玩弄“诈术”，最初伪称武装法案与大西洋公约互不相干，但在参院批准公约后，它就立即向国会提出武装法案。
    指南针日报记者史东继续揭露武装法案称：如果国会批准这个计划，它就要打击英国的复兴。史东指出，英国的军费已经严重地妨碍英国增加生产和改善生活标准。
