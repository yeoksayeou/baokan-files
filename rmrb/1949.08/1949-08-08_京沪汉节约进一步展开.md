Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th:
    The streamlining and economy drive in government offices and factories in Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan and other places are continuing. In response to the call of the Central China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, the various organs and factories in Wuhan have generally carried out inspections of past waste phenomena and formulated plans for streamlining and economy. After a strict inspection, the directly subordinate organs of the Provisional People's Government of Central China found that one-third of the expenses in July were wasted. After inspection, the Hankou Bank of Communications has handed over non-essential items worth more than 190,000 yuan, and the Wuchang Office of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government has streamlined 22 unnecessary personnel. Workers in various public factories in Wuhan have launched a movement to increase production and practice economy. Workers at the Hanyang Arsenal voluntarily donated equipment and voluntarily requested to increase working hours. Nine employees of the Jiang'an Materials Factory of the Pinghan Railway voluntarily excavated discarded iron materials, and have excavated about 50 tons in five days. The riveters in the factory used scrap iron to make rivets, completing the ten-day plan in five days and saving 100 jin of coal. All the forgers in the factory picked up coal slag, saving one-third of the coal per furnace compared to the past. The streamlining and economy drive in Beijing and Shanghai has also achieved preliminary results. Employees of the Shanghai Railway Bureau have launched an economy competition, and the bureau's electricity consumption has been reduced from more than 4,000 degrees in the past to more than 3,700 degrees. Both the China Textile Corporation and the Agricultural and Forestry Department have cut redundant institutions and superfluous personnel. Workers at the No. 1 Factory of China Textile Corporation used broken tube controllers to make horizontal spindles, so that raw materials would not be wasted. All departments in Nanjing are saving much more water and electricity than in the past, and the Compilation and Translation Museum saves 90% more water and electricity than in May. All staff members of the United Front Work Department of the Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central Library also use the open space next to the office and dormitory to grow vegetables. The Central Library has also established a production promotion committee to specifically promote amateur production, stipulating that 70% of the production income belongs to the producers, and 30% is used as employee welfare funds. More than 40 people remaining at the National History Museum voluntarily requested a pay cut, totaling more than 800 yuan in basic salary.

    京沪汉节约进一步展开
    【新华社北平六日电】上海、南京、武汉等地机关、工厂的精简、节约运动正继续进行中。武汉各机关、各工厂响应中共中央华中局的号召，普遍进行了对过去浪费现象的检查，并制订了精简节约的计划。中原临时人民政府直属机关经严格检查，发现七月份开支中有三分之一是属于浪费的；汉口交通银行检查后已交出的非必需用品价值十九万余元，武汉市人民政府武昌办事处精简了非必要人员二十二人。武汉各公营工厂工人则展开了增产节约的运动。汉阳兵工厂工人自动捐献器材，并自动要求增加工作时间。平汉路江岸材料厂的九位职工，自动挖掘过去废弃铁料，五天已挖出约五十吨。该厂铆工班利用废铁制铆钉，五天就完成了十天的计划，并省煤一百斤。该厂锻工全体动手捡煤渣，每炉较过去省煤三分之一。京沪的精简节约运动亦已获得初步成绩。上海铁路局员工已展开节约竞赛，该局用电已由过去的四千多度减为三千七百多度。中纺与农林处都裁减了骈枝机构和浮冗人员。中纺一厂工人则利用坏筒管制成横锭，使原料不致浪费。南京各机关用水用电均较过去节约甚多，编译馆用水用电较五月份节约了百分之九十。中共市委统战部及中央图书馆全体工作人员并利用办公室及宿舍旁的空地种菜。中央图书馆并成立了生产推动委员会专门推动业余生产，规定生产所得百分之七十归生产者，百分之三十作员工福利基金。国史馆留馆人员四十余人自动要求减薪，合计共减少底薪八百余元。
