Buying Peanuts
Short Story from the Old Liberated Area (One)
Chun Bing

Last year, when the Kuomintang army妄想(妄想is a derogatory word, conveying a sense of delusion) attempted to偷袭(sneak attack) the people's Shijiazhuang, we - non-combatants, temporarily evacuated to Beigou Village, Yuanshi. One day, I went to another village. By the roadside field, there was a middle-aged farmer digging peanuts. I wanted to buy some, but as soon as I approached him, before I could even greet him, he smiled and handed me the basket: "Comrade, eat peanuts!" I was afraid he misunderstood my intention, so I quickly took out a five-hundred-yuan Ji banknote from my pocket, indicating that I wanted to buy them. He suddenly seemed a little unhappy, waving his hand at me, blocking the Ji banknote, and bringing the basket of peanuts even closer to me: "You eat them!" I also quickly waved my hand and said: "Will you sell them? I want to buy them!" He got angry, put the basket on the ground, and went back to digging peanuts, ignoring me. For a moment, I didn't know what to do, holding the Ji banknote, at a loss. He looked up at me, still angrily, threw down the hoe, stood up, and protested to me: "You are a cadre, I am a翻身户(peasant who benefited from land reform), poor and lower-middle peasant, a member of the basic masses, we are all one family, if you want to eat, then eat! Buy? You are looking down on me too much!" He re-handed me the peanut basket. Seeing that the situation was so "serious", almost becoming a political issue (looking down on the basic masses), I had to apologetically take back the Ji banknote and reach out to grab a small handful of peanuts.

"Take more!" He was still a little dissatisfied, but already smiling innocently.

    买花生
    老解放区琐记之一
    春冰
    去年国民党军妄想偷袭人民的石家庄的时候，我们——非战斗人员，暂疏散到元氏北沟村。一天，我到另一个村子去，路边地里，有一个中年农民在刨花生，我想买一点，但刚一走近他，还未打招呼，他便笑咪咪地把篮子递过来：“同志，吃花生！”我怕他误会了我的意思，赶忙在胸前的袋里取出一张五百元冀钞，表明我是要买，他忽然显得有点不高兴了，一手向我摇摇，挡着冀钞，一手把盛花生的篮子更递近我：“您吃呀！”我也连忙向他摇手说：“您卖？我就买！”他发火了，把篮子往地里一放，回头各自刨花生，不睬我，我一时也不知道怎样才好，拿着冀钞回不了神，他抬头望我一眼，仍然生气地，把刨子一掷，立起身来，向我抗议：“您是干部，我是翻身户，贫雇农，基本群众，一家人，要吃您就吃！买？您太瞧不起我！”重新把花生篮子递给我。我看情势既如此“严重”，快要成为政治问题（瞧不起基本群众）了，只得十分抱歉地收回冀钞，伸手抓一小把花生。
    “多拿点呀！”他还有点不满意，但已经天真地笑了。
