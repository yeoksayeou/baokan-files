　　The Companion
    Panova
    (By the Soviet writer Panova, translated by Su Ling, proofread by Cao Jing)
  　Part One: Night
    Chapter Two: Lina
    They arrived. Besides what was on her mind, she didn’t see anything else at that time, she forgot the grand review, forgot the acrobats, forgot that she was soaked to the bone, she got out of the car.
    Until now, Lina hadn’t loved anyone in the world.
    She had no one to love. Life carried her past crowds, things, and families. She never had her own family, never had her own room. Even her name had been changed so many times. Her mother named her Valentinka. But in the kindergarten, there were six children named Valentinka; to distinguish her, they called her Lina. When she grew up, she hated her name. She changed her name to Yelena.
    She didn’t want to recall the past. At the age of six, she had an appendectomy. At that time, she lived in the children's ward of the municipal hospital. After the anesthesia, she felt terrible, bitter saliva choked her, no one wiped the saliva from her lips, but she couldn’t call for help. In front of the other children, their mothers were sitting—all visiting them. Lina was placed behind a screen. "Don't cry, it doesn't hurt at all!" a fat nurse said when she moaned. Lina didn't cry. A person behind the screen asked:
    "Whose child is this?"
    The nurse replied:
    "Ownerless, it's a child from the orphanage."
    Her mother's situation that day was very bad. She loved to drink: she earned a little money and bought wine, bought cucumbers, got some women together, and they all drank, drank, and advised the mother:
    "You go and sue him above, go sue that bastard. If he's such a bastard, there's nothing else to say, you go and sue him above."
    Lina had seen this bastard once or twice. Her mother bathed her, put on clean clothes, and took her to a Nepman's (note) small shop in the market. Next to the shop, right on the street, there was a large warm pot; chunks of mutton were skewered on small sticks, sizzling in the pot, exuding fragrance. In the shop, there was a table with a barrel-shaped salt shaker, a pepper shaker, and a dish containing finely chopped green onions. This boss was that bastard. He personally cut the meat, grilled the meat, and swept the floor. Lina and her mother sat at the table, using their fingers to take the mutton off the sticks and eat it. Oil dripped down Lina’s arm, all the way to her elbow, leaving a curved mark. The boss sat down, wiping the sweat from his face with a dirty apron.
    "Eat," he sighed, said to Lina. "Eat this skewer of soft ones," and then, with his hand, he picked out a skewer and put it in front of her. He wasn't young, he had a gray-yellow beard, and one leg was made of wood.
    The mother, covered in oil, said crying:
    "It's pitiful to see, other people's children are dressed cleanly, but my own doesn't even have shoes to wear in autumn and winter, but she can't get the best of it?"
    "Eat this skewer of soft ones," the boss put meat in her dish, said softly. "I have a big family, so what can I do? Plus, my stepmother brings some children as guests, and the taxes are so high, there's no money to pay, there's no income… Mutton prices are rising, the customers are miserable, so I just have to sweep floors for people."
    "Then don't seduce people, don't seduce people!" the mother said.
    The boss sighed deeply and said softly:
    "If you can find evidence for me, then it's a completely different story."
    "Heavens!" the mother held a skewer of mutton to her chest and said.
    Lina listened to their conversation, looking at the pepper shaker. Even when leaving, she always looked back at the pepper shaker, but didn't dare to ask for it.
    When they parted, the boss gave the mother some money, Lina and her mother went to the fish market, the mother bought some vegetables, and then bought wine, and some women gathered at home again, all drinking, drinking, the mother, with a flushed face, shouted:
    "I'm going to find evidence for that bastard, I'll let him know how to seduce people, you son of a bitch, you bad seed!"
    "Sue him, go sue him above!" everyone advised. "Be lenient with him, and he'll be even worse!"
    The mother was a ragpicker. Sometimes she wouldn’t come back for two or three days. One day she came back with a man, they had dinner and went to bed, the mother put Lina on chairs pushed together. In the morning, Lina woke up, went to the bed, and carefully looked at the guest. He was sleeping on the edge of the bed, two fat hands hanging down, close to her. The blue veins on his arms, swollen and bulging, half of his fingers, were covered with dense black hair. Lina felt nauseous. She picked up a piece of wood and hit the blue veins on his hand, but the hand still didn’t move.
    At lunchtime, the mother got up, went to the shop, came back and sat down to eat with the guest. She poured half a glass of beer for Lina and took a piece of frozen meat. From their conversation, she knew where her mother was going. She was happy. At first, she drank too much beer, laughing, and then she fell asleep in her seat. The next day, her mother took her to a street and pointed out a two-story white house with peeling walls.
    "You go here," she said, "you go straight in, don't hesitate at all. Just say you're an orphan, no father, no mother, no one at all."
    The mother was making snacks, and her friends brought some cups and plates, holding a grand banquet. The mother's hair was disheveled, wearing new silk clothes, sometimes dancing, sometimes sitting at the table, supporting her cheeks with her fists.
    "My fate, my love," she said. "Who will punish him? The one who gave up what was theirs, but should this one accept it? If that bastard paid me the money he should, or even gave me mutton, the bastard, he desperately denies it, but I'm just being a fool. I still want to have children."
    "Have them, have them, Pasha, look forward to it!" the guests shouted, and then she put on her blue clothes again and danced, the clothes bulging on her like bark.
    This noisy life made Lina tired. She put on her knitted hat, which was the only hat she wore in winter and summer. Carrying a tin box and an awl—these were her toys. She took these and quietly, without anyone seeing, went out, and she went straight to that two-story white house with peeling walls.
    "I am an orphan," she said to the two girls with short hair standing at the door, "I have no parents, no mother, no one at all."
    The two girls silently, seriously, carefully looked her up and down. She raised her head and repeated the memorized words again. One girl asked:
    "How old are you?"
    Another girl said to the first:
    "Go and call Anna?"
    Lina looked into the gate. There were squares, swings, and green grass all around. (To be continued)

    Note: Small speculative merchants and upstarts with small private property in the early years of the Soviet New Economic Policy.

　　旅伴
    潘诺瓦
    （苏联潘诺瓦著苏龄译曹靖校）
  　第一部　夜
    第二章　琳娜
    他们来到了。除了她心里的事以外，那时她什么也没看见，她忘了大检阅，忘了翻斤斗的人，忘了自己浑身都是湿透了的，她下车了。
    直到现在为止，在世界上琳娜还不曾爱过一个人。
    她没有什么人可爱的。生命带着她从人群，事物以及家庭的旁边过去了。她从来没有自己的家庭，没有自己的房间。就连她的名字也改了多少次呢。母亲给她起名叫华伦锦。可是在幼儿院有六个孩子叫华伦锦呢；为了区别起见，就给她叫琳娜。等她长大了的时候，她讨厌她的名字。她就改名叶琳娜。
    她不愿回亿往事。六岁的时候，就割过盲肠炎。那时她住在市立医院的儿童病房里。上了麻药以后，她难过，苦唾液窒息着她，没有人把这唾液从她嘴唇上擦掉，可是她又不能叫人。别的孩子们跟前，都有母亲在坐着——都是来看他们的。把琳娜放在风屏后边。“别哭吧，一点也不痛的！”当她呻吟的时候，一个胖看护说道。琳娜不哭了。一个人在风屏后边问题：
    “这是谁的孩子？”
    护士答道：
    “没主的，这是幼儿院的孩子。”
    当日母亲的情况是很糟的。她爱喝酒：赚点钱就买酒，买王瓜，来些女人，都喝着，喝着，劝着母亲说：
    “你到上边告去，去告那混蛋去。如果他这样混蛋的话，没有别的话说，你到上边去告他好了。”
    琳娜见过这位混蛋一两次。母亲给她洗了澡，换上干净衣服，带着她到市场里的一位乃普曼（注）的小铺子去。小铺旁边，直然就在街上摆着一口大暖锅；用小棍子串成一串串的羊肉块，嗤嗤的在锅里烧着，喷着香味。小铺子里放着一张桌子，桌上放着桶形的盐瓶，胡椒瓶和一只碟子，碟子里盛着切细的青葱。这老板就是那位混蛋。他亲自切肉，烧肉，扫地。琳娜和母亲坐在桌旁，用手指从小棍上把羊肉取下来，吃着。油水顺着琳娜的胳膊流着，一直流到肘弯上，留下一道弯弯曲曲的印痕。老板坐下来，用脏围裙拭着脸上的汗。
    “吃吧，”他叹着气，对琳娜说。“吃这一串软的吧，”于是用手摸着选了一串，放到她面前。他年纪不轻了，留着灰黄的胡子，一只腿是木头作的。
    母亲混身都是油，哭着说：
    “看着真可怜，人家的孩子穿得干干净净的，自家的秋冬天连鞋穿都没有，可是她那儿不胜人呢？”
    “你吃这串软的吧，”老板往碟子里给她放着肉，低声说。“我有一大家人，那我有什么办法呢？加之继母带些孩子来当客，捐税也大得惊人，那有钱出呢，那有进项出呢……羊肉涨价了，顾客惨得很，只有去替人家打扫地吧。”
    “那就别引诱人好了，别引诱人好了！”母亲说道。
    老板深深的叹了一口气，低声说：
    “如果你能给我找出证据来，那就完全是另一番话了。”
    “天呵！”母亲把一串羊肉拿到胸前说。
    琳娜听着他们的话，望着胡椒瓶。甚至在走的时候，她还总是回看着那只胡椒瓶，可是不敢开口要。
    分手的时候，老板给了母亲一些钱，琳娜同母亲去到鱼市上，母亲买了些小菜，然后去买了酒，家里又聚了些女人，都喝着，喝着，母亲满脸通红的叫道：
    “我给他那混蛋找证据去，我叫他晓得怎么引诱人的，狗仔子，狗坏种！”
    “告他去，到上边告他去！”大家都劝道。“对他宽大，那他更坏呢！”
    母亲是一个拾破烂的。有时候她两三天都不回来。有一天她带着一个男子回来了，他们吃过晚饭就上床睡了，母亲把琳娜放到并在一起的椅子上。早晨琳娜醒来，走到床跟前，仔细看着这位客人。他睡在床上边，两只胖手悬着，紧挨着她。胳膊上的青血管，胀得鼓腾腾的，半截手指，都长满了稠密的黑毛。琳娜要恶心起来。她拾起一块木片，照那手上的青血管打去，那手依旧没有动。
    到午饭的时候，母亲起来，上铺子去了一趟，回来就同客人坐下吃饭。给琳娜倒了半杯啤酒，取了一块冻肉。从他们的谈话里，她晓得母亲要到什么地方去。她高兴着。起初她喝啤酒过量了，笑着，后来就在原坐位上睡着了。第二天，母亲把她带到一条街上，指给她一座两层楼的白房子，房子的墙皮都剥落了。
    “你到这里去，”她说，“你一直走进去，一点不要迟疑。你就说你是一个孤女，没有父亲，没有母亲，什么人都没有。”
    母亲做着点心，女友们端来些杯盘，举行了一个盛大的宴会。母亲头发散乱着，穿着新的绸衣服，忽而跳着舞，忽而坐在棹边，用拳头支着双颊。
    “我的命运呵，我的爱情呵，”她说道。“谁会去制裁他呢？那一个把自己的放弃了，可是这一个呢，应该接受吗？如果那个混蛋把应该给我的钱付给我的话，再不然给我羊肉也可以，混蛋，他拼命耍赖，可是我白当傻子。我还要生孩子呢。”
    “要生的，生的，波霞，你期望着吧！”客人都大喊着，于是她又穿着自己的蓝衣服，跳起舞来，那衣服就象树皮似的，在她身上鼓着。
    这种吵嚷的生活，使琳娜厌倦了。她戴上自己的编织的帽子，这是她冬夏所戴的唯一的一顶帽子。带着一只罐头盒子和一把锥柄——这是她的玩具呵。她带着这些，就悄悄的，谁也没瞧见的出去了，她到了街上，就一直向那座两层楼的，墙皮破落的白房子走去了。
    “我是一个孤女，”她对两个剪发的站在门口的大女孩子说道，“我没有父母，没有母亲，什么人也没有。”
    那两个女孩子默然的，严肃的从上到下把她仔细端详了一番。她抬起头来，又把那背熟了的话重复了一遍。一个女孩子问道：
    “你多大了？”
    另一个女孩子向着第一个说：
    “去把安娜叫来吧？”
    琳娜往大门里看了一眼。那儿有广场，秋千，以及周围的绿草。（未完）
    注：苏联新经济政策施行初年的小投机商人，小私有财产的暴发户。
