　　Shanghai Economic News in Brief

　　Renminbi Credit Improves, Bank Reserves Increase
    ▲Due to recent price stability in Shanghai, Renminbi credit is improving. As a result, deposits at the People's Bank of China are increasing daily, and reserves are also growing. In the twelve days from the 5th to the 16th of this month, reserves increased by over 6 billion. Even with salary payments by some factories on the 15th, deposits and reserves at the People's Bank of China continued to increase.

  　Import and Export Material Documents Unified Handling by Trade Office, Goods Tax Collected by Customs
    ▲In order to unify the handling of import and export material documents in East China, to take care of private enterprises, and to simplify administrative procedures, the East China Financial and Economic Office has decided that from now on, all import and export materials will be uniformly processed by the Trade Office. The former practice of having the competent authority issue documents, which were then verified by Customs before release, will cease.
    In addition, the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau, in order to simplify the import and export declaration procedures for goods subject to goods tax, has decided that the Jianghai Customs will collect the tax on its behalf, and there is no need to declare to the Goods Tax Bureau first. Five provisional measures for tax collection have been formulated on the 15th.

   　Property Insurance Company Underwrites Transport War Risk
    ▲In order to smash the enemy's blockade, encourage the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and protect the interests of transport merchants, the Shanghai China Property Insurance Company has specially started to underwrite transport war risk insurance from today. All water and railway transport from Shanghai to Zhejiang, Northern Jiangsu, Hankou, Changsha, Nanjing, and Northern China are covered. With this added protection, the exchange of materials will become smoother.

    Northeast Soybeans and Soybean Oil Exchanged for Shanghai Cotton Yarn and Gunny Sacks
    ▲In order to vigorously support Shanghai and smash the enemy's blockade, the Northeast has, in addition to the 2,520-plus tons of soybeans already shipped, also delivered 60 tons of soybean oil. Another 660 tons of soybeans and 360 tons of soybean oil are expected to arrive within days. Shanghai has already exchanged 280 bales of cotton yarn and 144,000 gunny sacks for these goods.
