　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 18th. Xiao Hua, Deputy Head of the Chinese Democratic Youth Delegation, delivered a speech at the opening ceremony of the World Youth and Student Festival on the 14th. The full text of the speech is as follows:
　　Dear friends: The Chinese democratic youth celebrate the World Democratic Youth and Student Festival with boundless excitement and a sense of victory, extend our highest respect to the representatives of democratic youth from all countries, and pay tribute to the people of Hungary. The Chinese people, who have long suffered from the oppression and enslavement of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, after a long period of heroic and arduous struggle, have now basically eliminated the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and will soon achieve complete victory throughout the country. The banner of an independent, free, and democratic New China has been flying over the land of our motherland. This is a great historic transformation for the 475 million people of China, and the third great victory of the people following the October Revolution in the Soviet Union and the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War.
　　Our struggle is victorious, and it is linked with your struggles. Without the sympathy and assistance of the world democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, we could not have achieved such a great victory. Our people sincerely thank the people of the Soviet Union, the people of all New Democratic countries, and the profound friendship of the people of the world. The unity of the world's democratic forces is the guarantee of victory in our common struggle. The imperialist bloc headed by American imperialism is now stirring up trouble, trying to unleash a new world war. American imperialism is also continuing to interfere in China's internal affairs, supporting the last-ditch struggle of the Chinese reactionaries. Recently, it has been plotting a so-called "East Asian Anti-Communist Alliance" and attempting to organize a so-called "International Volunteer Army" to massacre our people, and carrying out new conspiracies such as an economic blockade against our country. We, the entire Chinese people, the entire Chinese youth, accuse you: American imperialism is the instigator of a new world war. We must strengthen our unity and use our actions to shatter this sinister conspiracy of American imperialism. The victory of the Chinese people's liberation struggle proves that no matter what conspiracies and tricks American imperialism plays, it cannot intimidate us and cannot save the doomed fate of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries; it proves that imperialism is just a paper tiger. We have the incomparably strong Soviet Union, the world's bulwark of peace and democracy, and the unity of the world's democratic forces, which is growing day by day. We have the strength and the confidence to defeat imperialism. Chinese youth will continue to carry forward the glorious fighting spirit of the past, and together with you, under the banner of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students, will fight to the end to defend the independence of our motherland and for lasting world peace and people's democracy. Long live the liberation of the Chinese people! Long live the friendship and unity of democratic youth around the world! Long live Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people! Long live Stalin, the leader of the people of the world!

　　萧华在世界青年与学生联欢会上
  　控诉美帝挑拨新战争
    号召加强团结粉碎这纸老虎的罪恶阴谋
    【新华社布拉格十八日电】中国民主青年代表团代团长萧华十四日在世界青年与学生联欢大会开会式上发表演讲，演词全文如下：
    亲爱的朋友们：中国民主青年以无限的兴奋与胜利的心情，庆祝世界民主青年与学生节，并向各国民主青年代表们致崇高友谊的敬礼，向匈牙利人民致敬。久受帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义压迫奴役的中国人民，在中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东主席领导之下，经过长期英勇艰苦的斗争，现在业已基本上消灭了国民党蒋介石匪帮的反动统治，很快就要在全国范围内取得完全胜利。独立、自由、民主的新中国的旗帜已经飘扬在祖国的大地上。这是中国四万万七千五百万人民历史的大翻身，这是继苏联十月革命和世界反法西斯战争胜利之后的第三次人民伟大胜利。
    我们斗争是胜利的，和你们的斗争连结在一起的。如果没有苏联为首的世界民主阵营的同情与援助，我们就不可能取得如此大的胜利。我国人民衷心感谢苏联人民，感谢各新民主主义国家的人民及世界人民的深厚友谊。世界民主力量的团结，是我们共同斗争胜利的保证。以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团现在正兴波作浪，要掀起新的世界战争。美帝国主义并且继续干涉中国内政，支持着中国反动派的最后挣扎。最近又在策动所谓“东亚反共联盟”，并企图组织屠杀我国人民的所谓“国际义勇队”；进行对我国的经济封锁等新的阴谋。我们全中国人民、全中国青年向你们控诉：美帝国主义就是新世界战争的挑拨者。我们要加强团结，用我们的行动来粉碎美帝国主义这一罪恶阴谋。我国人民解放斗争的胜利证明了：不管美帝国主义玩弄什么阴谋诡计，都吓不倒我们，都无法挽救蒋介石反动派死亡的命运；证明了帝国主义不过是一只纸老虎。我们有无比强大的世界和平民主堡垒的苏联和日益增长的全世界民主力量的团结。我们有力量、有信心战胜帝国主义。中国青年将继续发挥以往的光荣斗争精神，同你们一道，在世界民主青年联盟和世界学生联合会的旗帜下，为保卫我们祖国的独立、为世界的持久和平与人民民主而奋斗到底。中国人民解放万岁！全世界民主青年友谊团结万岁！中国人民领袖毛泽东万岁！世界人民领袖斯大林万岁！
