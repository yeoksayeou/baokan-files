    Fuxin Coal Mine Recovers Rapidly
    Nearly Completing Annual Plan in Five Months
    [Report from this newspaper] The recovery work at the Fuxin Coal Mine is progressing rapidly. Over the past five months, 21,601 meters of tunnels have been restored, nearly completing the annual plan (21,670 meters). The efficiency per worker is 0.142 meters, exceeding the original plan of 0.100 meters. Sixteen production pit openings have been restored, more than double the original plan. There are now 30 production and recovery pit openings, while the original plan for the entire year was only 23. The amount of earth and stone excavated from cleaning and organizing the tunnels is 35,258 cubic meters, and 10.28 frames of various supports have been repaired. Over 5.25 million cubic meters of water have been drained (including production pit openings). In terms of open-pit mines, the original coal-producing open pit has expanded its stripping and mining areas. In the other two open pits, one is using manual stripping and has already produced coal, while the other has begun stripping and is expected to produce coal next year. The main reasons for the rapid recovery of the mine are as follows: In addition to implementing the correct policy of "focusing on recovery in the first half of the year," the Ministry of Industry's substantial investment, the replenishment of personnel, and the basic guarantee of power and material supplies, there are also the following points: Firstly, the workers' awareness has improved, and they have demonstrated production enthusiasm. For example, in Taiping No. 3 Pit, there was a large fire in the past, and the pit wood was burned into charcoal. The roadways of the two main tunnels were charred. During the recovery, the suffocating methane gas was particularly dense. In order to ventilate and prevent spontaneous combustion, it was necessary to build new or repair airtight seals before the methane gas was exhausted. Thanks to the security personnel and many workers taking turns to work intensively, sometimes drinking vinegar to continue working after being exposed to gas, the recovery project was finally completed.

    Secondly, the repair and appropriate allocation of mechanical equipment ensured that almost all the coal washing machines with transport belts were repaired, ensuring their continued use even with the surge in production in May. Through developing creativity and self-manufacturing wind pumps and self-rotating axle carts, nine locomotives and two electric shovels were repaired, ensuring the start of stripping operations at the Xinqiu North Open Pit, etc. The leadership also promptly allocated various equipment such as water pumps, iron coal cars, and safety lamps.

    In addition, not only were the workers relied upon, but also the enthusiasm of the technical personnel was brought into play. Therefore, in the recovery and production process, in addition to the many contributions made by security personnel, pit foremen, and veteran workers, many technical personnel have also made significant contributions.

    The rescue team played an even greater role in overcoming difficulties. Because some pit openings still had fires or were close to catching fire, if air was allowed to enter, the fire would either grow larger or ignite immediately; but if air was not allowed to enter, the methane gas inside the pit would be very dense, making it impossible for people to enter and assess the situation, making recovery impossible. This is why the rescue team had to be relied upon. Over the past five months, all rescue team members (without leaving production) have worked together to inspect and restore five pit openings, enabling the recovery and re-extraction of 1,519 meters of tunnels and hundreds of thousands of tons of coal.

    阜新煤矿恢复迅速
    五个月将近完成全年计划
    【本报讯】阜新煤矿恢复工作进展迅速。五个月来，已恢复坑道二一·六○一米，几已完成全年计划（二一·六七○米），每工效率是○·一四二米，超过原计划○·○四二米；已恢复生产坑口十六个，超过原计划一倍；已有生产与恢复坑口卅个，原计划全年才廿三个。坑内扫道整理出土石量三五二五八立米，修各种棚子一○·二八架，排水五百二十五万余立米（生产坑口在内）。在露天矿方面，原产煤的一个露天，已扩大剥离和采煤区域，另两露天一个用人工剥土已出煤，一个已开始剥离，明年可产煤。该矿恢复迅速的主要原因：除执行了“上半年应以恢复为主”的正确方针，工业部的大量投资、人员得到补充、电源和器材的供应基本得到了保证外，还有以下几点：首先是员工觉悟提高，发挥了生产积极性。如太平三坑，过去坑内着火很大，坑木烧成了木炭，两道大巷巷道烧成了焦子，在恢复时，窒息的瓦斯特别浓厚，为了通风和防止再自然发火，又必须在瓦斯未排出前，新设或修理密闭等。由于保安人员和许多工友轮流突击，有时被瓦斯薰倒后喝些醋继续干，终于完成了恢复工程。
    其次，机械设备的修复和适当调配，有运输皮带的选煤机几已全部修复，保证了五月份产量激增下仍能使用。在展开创造精神自制风泵，自旋大车轴等情形下修复了九台机车两台电铲，保证了新邱北露天剥土开工等等。领导上更及时调配了抽水机、铁煤车、安全灯等各种器材。
    此外，不但依靠了工友并发挥了技术人员的积极性，因此在恢复与生产中除许多保安人员，坑长和老工友有很多建树外，许多技术人员贡也有很多献。
    救护队则更起了突破难关作用，因有些坑口依然有火，或接近于发火，如空气透进去，火就要燃大或马上会起火；但空气不透入，坑内瓦斯很浓，人进不去，则坑内情况不明，无法恢复，这就只好依靠救护队。五个月来，全体救护队员（不脱离生产）群策群力在五个坑口进行了检查和恢复工作，使一五、一九○米坑道，几十万吨煤得到恢复和再采的可能。
