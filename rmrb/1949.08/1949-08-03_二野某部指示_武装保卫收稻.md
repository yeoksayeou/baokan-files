All units should also use their spare time to help the masses with the harvest, and after investigation, should first help the families of martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and the elderly, widowed, and impoverished farmers who lack labor.

    【新华社浙赣前线二日电】江南收稻季节即届。为保护人民收获和密切军民关系，人民解放军第二野战军某部政治部已发出关于武装保卫稻收的指示，号召所属各部在收稻期间组织一定部队，划分地区，武装保卫群众收割，并结合强有力的政治攻势，以瓦解和孤立土匪特务分子。各部并应利用空隙时间帮助群众收割；要经过调查，先帮助无劳动力的烈士家属、革命军人家属和孤寡及贫寒农民收割。
