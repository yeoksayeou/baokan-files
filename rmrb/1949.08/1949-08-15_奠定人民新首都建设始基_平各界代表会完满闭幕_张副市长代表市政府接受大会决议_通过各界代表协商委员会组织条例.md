    Laying the Foundation for the Construction of a New People's Capital
    The Closing of the Meeting of Representatives from All Circles in Beiping
    Vice Mayor Zhang Accepts Resolutions of the Congress on Behalf of the Municipal Government
    Organization Regulations of the All-Circles Representative Consultative Committee Passed
    [Beiping News] The Beiping Municipal All-Circles Representative Meeting victoriously closed yesterday afternoon (the 14th). A total of 265 representatives attended the meeting, along with approximately 500 guests, observers, and audience members. The congress continued to discuss proposals in the morning and held a closing ceremony in the afternoon. Chairman Peng Zhen delivered a summary report of the congress, discussed and passed the Organization Regulations of the Beiping Municipal All-Circles Representative Consultative Committee, the Congress Declaration, telegrams of respect to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, telegrams of respect to the various Field Armies of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and a telegram of thanks to the peasants of the Liberated Areas. In addition, a preparatory committee of 105 representatives was formed for the Beiping branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, responsible for carrying out preparatory work.

    The congress discussed financial, economic and other proposals in the morning. First, Cheng Hongyi, convener of the financial and economic group of the proposal review committee, reported on the review process, stating that the congress received a total of 105 financial and economic proposals, which were reviewed and consolidated into 95 proposals. Among them, 72 proposals with proposed handling opinions were submitted to the government or other relevant departments for handling, 6 proposals were submitted to the congress for discussion, and 1 proposal was retained. Subsequently, Peng Cheng, Deputy Manager of the Beiping Municipal Trading Company, explained the trading work situation in the past six months; Jia Xingwu, Deputy Manager of the Beiping Branch of the People's Bank of China, explained the basic purpose of the Real Value Savings.

    The congress discussed and unanimously passed proposals such as "Practice Strict Economy and Develop Production to Build a New Beiping and Support the Frontline," "Request the government to ban speculation and profiteering, severely punish unscrupulous merchants for hoarding, eradicate silver dollar trading, and ban illegal activities of silver and money businesses," "Request the government to find ways to guide floating capital into production, encourage the production enthusiasm of private industrialists, and encourage commercial capital to shift to industrial production," and "Establish an industrial production guidance organization to lead the development of production, strengthen the industrial laboratory, and recruit various technical talents." Regarding the 14 proposals on cooperatives, they were merged into one proposal for discussion, and finally passed: Cooperatives should play a role in stabilizing prices and should increase the types of goods sold by cooperatives.

    When discussing the proposal on "Controlling floating capital, requesting the government to strictly restrict the large-scale carrying of cash by travelers entering and leaving the city to avoid disrupting the market and to stabilize prices," it aroused heated debate. Jia Xingwu, a representative from the banking sector, raised objections, saying: "Restricting travelers from carrying cash is restricting the exchange of materials. At the same time, restricting a few unscrupulous merchants will inconvenience the general public, which is unreasonable." Gu Jingbo, a representative from the industrial sector, said: "Restricting the carrying of cash will hinder the development of legitimate industry and commerce." Han Songshang, a representative from the commercial sector, Peng Cheng, Deputy Manager of the Trading Company, Duan Baolin, a representative from the Student Union, and Lin Baoluo, a representative from the medical sector, also successively raised objections. Finally, the proposal was amended and passed as: Strictly ban the use of floating capital for speculation, but ensure the convenience of legitimate industrialists and merchants. When discussing "other" proposals, Weng Dujian, convener of the "other" proposal review group, reported on the review process: A total of 15 "other" proposals were received, which were merged into 10 proposals after review. Among them, in addition to two proposals as temporary motions, one proposal was submitted to the government or relevant departments for handling, and eight proposals were submitted to the government for reference, all of which were unanimously approved by the attending representatives.

    After the proposal discussion was completed, Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu spoke on behalf of the Beiping Municipal People's Government, expressing sincere acceptance of the resolutions passed by the congress. Vice Mayor Zhang said: "The work that the municipal government has done for the people of Beiping is not enough. We have also reviewed it, but we only clearly and definitely knew which work was not done enough after listening to the discussions of the congress for the past few days. Thank you for the opinions and criticisms raised by everyone. In addition to the work that we have already done or are doing, we will try our best to do it as quickly as possible within the limits of human and financial resources. Please check how much work the government has completed at the next congress." The morning session adjourned at 1:00 PM. At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, Congress Chairman Peng Zhen gave a summary report (excerpts to be issued separately), followed by the adoption of the regulations of the All-Circles Representative Conference Consultative Committee and the list of committee members of the preparatory committee for the Beiping branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the adoption of various telegrams and declarations (see separate article).

    平各界代表会完满闭幕
    张副市长代表市政府接受大会决议
    通过各界代表协商委员会组织条例
    【平市讯】北平市各界代表会议已于昨（十四）日下午胜利闭幕。是日到会代表共二百六十五人，连同来宾、列席及旁听者共约五百余人。大会于上午继续讨论提案，下午举行闭幕典礼，由大会主席彭真做大会总结报告，讨论和通过北平市各界代表协商委员会组织条例、大会宣言、向毛主席、朱总司令致敬电、向中国人民解放军各野战军致敬电、向解放区农民致谢电。并由代表一百零五人组成中苏友好协会北平分会筹备委员会，负责进行筹备工作。
    大会于上午讨论财经及其他两类提案，首由提案审查委员会财经组召集人程宏毅报告提案审查经过称：大会收到财经类提案共一百零五案，经审查合并成九十五案，其中经审查提出处理意见送交政府或其他有关部门办理者共七十二案，提交大会讨论者六案，保留者一案。继由北平市贸易公司彭城副经理说明半年来的贸易工作情况；中国人民银行北平分行副经理贾星五说明折实储蓄的基本目的。
    大会讨论并一致通过了“厉行精简节约发展生产以建设新北平支援前线”、“请政府取缔投机倒把，严惩奸商囤积，根绝银元买卖取缔银钱业不法活动”、“请政府设法将游资导入生产鼓励私营工业家的生产情绪并奖励商业资本转入工业生产”、“建立工业生产指导机构领导发展生产加强工业实验所并罗致各项技术人材”等提案。关于合作社的十四案，合并成一案讨论，最后通过：合作社要起稳定物价作用，并应增加合作社出售的货品种类。
    当讨论到“控制游资，请政府严格限制出入本市旅客大量携带现钞以免扰乱市场而期稳定物价案”时，引起热烈辩论，银行界代表贾星五提出反对意见，他说：“限制旅客携带现钞，就是限制物资交流，同时因限制少数奸商而使得一般人们都感到不便，这是不合理的。”工业界代表谷静波说：“限制携带现钞，对正当工商业的发展是有妨碍的。”商业界代表韩诵裳、贸易公司副经理彭城、学联代表段宝林、医界代表林宝骆等也相继提出反对意见，最后将此案修正通过为：严厉取缔利用游资进行投机，但应保证正当工商业者的便利。讨论“其他类”提案时，由该类提案审查组召集人翁独健报告审查经过：其他类提案共十五案，经审查后合并为十案。其中除有两案作为临时动议外，送请政府或有关部门办理者一案，送交政府参考者八案，均经到会代表一致通过。
    提案讨论毕，由张友渔副市长代表北平市人民政府发言，表示诚恳接受大会所通过的决议，张副市长说：“市政府为北平人民所做的工作不够，我们也曾检讨过，但是究竟还有那些工作做的不够，直到听了大会几天来的讨论，才更清楚明确地知道了，感谢大家所提的意见和批评。大家所提出的，除了我们已经做的，或正在做的工作外，凡在人力，财力可能的情况下，当尽量尽速地去做，下次大会时请大家来检查政府完成了多少工作。”上午大会至一时休会。下午二时半，大会主席彭真作总结报告（摘要另发），继通过各界代表会议协商会委员会条例，和中苏友好协会北平分会筹备会委员会委员名单，并通过各项通电及宣言（见另条）。
