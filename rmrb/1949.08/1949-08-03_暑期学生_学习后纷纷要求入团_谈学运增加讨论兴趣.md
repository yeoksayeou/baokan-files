    Summer Students
    Eager to Join the Youth League After Studying
    Discussing Student Movements Increases Interest
    ▲ After the first phase of the summer study group's learning, many students have made ideological progress and requested to join the Youth League. In order to meet the students' requirements, the Youth League Organization Department of the Third Branch convened a meeting of organizational committee members from each sub-branch at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 2nd) to approve the procedures for probationary members to become full members and for joining the League, and to deploy the organizational work of the League committees at all levels for the second phase. (Study Group Correspondent Team)
    ▲ The Third Branch held a get-together on the afternoon of the 1st and invited Yucai students to participate. The performance program included chorus, yangko dance, acrobatics, magic, and other items.
    ▲ Female students from the study group began the second phase of their studies on the 1st, and their lives became more intensive, because they are now studying youth work. For example, yesterday (the 2nd), the discussion on the student movement before and after liberation was something everyone had personally participated in, so the interest in learning was even higher. (Study Group Correspondent Team)
    ▲ The Northeast Office of the Youth Academy called on students to strengthen collective life, and proposed organizing a "home" in the academy based on each school. In each "home," students would study and research together. There are now many "homes" such as "Girls' Second Middle School Home," "Fifth Middle School Home," and "Huizhong Home." The students are all very happy to live the "home" life. In the "home," they hold discussions on "individual freedom and collective freedom" and "labor creates the world." The "Huizhong Home" discussion resulted in the students understanding that only in collective freedom can there be individual freedom.
        (Zhang Baoxing)
    ▲ More than 300 students from the Northeast District of the Youth Academy went to Zhongshan Park at 1:00 PM yesterday (the 2nd) to visit the exhibition of war achievements photos. After viewing, they sat behind the Zhongshan Hall, and Comrade Helu spoke about the many creations of the People's Liberation Army in the war, such as tunnel warfare tactics and many moving stories. The students listened with great excitement.
          (Zhang Baoxing)
    ▲ The Arts and Learning Section of the Southeast District Youth Academy, in order to strengthen learning and improve students' political and theoretical level, has not only increased youth lectures but also designated this week as "Learning Week," calling on all schools to launch a learning upsurge and discuss the issues raised in past youth lectures. The League members of the Second Middle School also launched close reading and discussion of Chairman Mao's July 1st essay. (Li Baochen)
    ▲ After listening to "Labor Creates the World," the Recreation Section of the Academy, in order to cultivate students' labor viewpoint, decided to hold a "Half-Day Labor Movement" this week to clean up the Academy. All schools have responded enthusiastically. The Second Middle School and Beimang are striving to become labor models. (Li Baochen)

    暑期学生
    学习后纷纷要求入团
    谈学运增加讨论兴趣
    ▲暑期学习团第一阶段学习结束后，有许多同学在思想上进步了，要求参加青年团。三分团青年团组织部为了适合同学的要求，由昨日（二日）下午二时召集各分支组织委员开会，通过了候补团员转正手续和入团手续，并且布置第二阶段各级团委的组织工作。              （学习团通讯组）
    ▲第三分团在一日下午举行了联欢会，并请育英同学参加，演出节目有合唱，秧歌舞、口技、魔术等项。
    ▲学习团女同学从一日开始第二阶段的学习，生活更加紧张，因为现在学习的是青年工作，如昨日（二日）讨论解放前后的学生运动是大家亲身参加的，故学习的兴趣更提高了。            （学习团通讯组）
    ▲青年学园东北区办事处号召同学们加强过集体生活，提出了以各校为单位在学园组织一个“家”，在各“家”中同学们共同学习、研究，现在已有“女二中之家”“五中之家”“惠中之家”等许多的“家”，同学们全很高兴的过“家”的生活。在“家”里开讨论会，讨论“个人自由与集体自由”及“劳动创造世界”。“惠中之家”讨论结果，同学们明白了只有在集体自由中才有个人自由。
        （张宝兴）
    ▲青年学园东北区三百多同学，于昨（二日）下午一时到中山公园去参观战绩照片展览。看完后，坐在中山堂的后面，由赫鲁同志讲解放军在战争中的许多创造，如地道战术及许多可歌可泣的故事。同学们听得非常兴奋。
          （张宝兴）
    ▲东南区青年学园学艺股，为加强学习，提高同学政治理论水平，除增多青年讲座外，并定本星期为“学习周”，号召各校展开学习热潮，讨论过去青年讲座的问题。二中团员并展开精读，讨论毛主席七一论文。（李宝臣）
    ▲听完“劳动创造世界”后，学园康乐股为培养同学劳动观点，决定本周举行一次“半日劳动运动”，整理学园。各校已纷纷响应。二中、贝满，并争取做劳动模范。    （李宝臣）
