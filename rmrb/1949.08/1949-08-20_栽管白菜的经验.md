Experiences in Planting and Managing Chinese Cabbage
    Zhai Yuzhi

The methods of planting Chinese cabbage vary from place to place. One method is to plant "mother and son" cabbage, which involves preparing all the land to be planted and starting to sow seeds as soon as the Beginning of Autumn arrives. Some people plant by spot sowing, others by row sowing. After several thinnings, the seedlings are finally thinned to their final spacing. This method is relatively common in various regions. Another method is to concentrate on sowing seeds for seedling cultivation. Once the seedlings have grown four or five true leaves, transplanting begins. This method is customary and has been successfully practiced by the masses in areas such as Quyang, Kangxian, Fuping, and Wanxian. The latter method is better than the former. It has many advantages in preventing and controlling pests and diseases, as well as in management, and the Chinese cabbage grows well. The experience is as follows:

    Planting Methods

Many people plant cabbage in the same way, but some have their plants grow lush and green without ever needing replacement, while others have their plants remain yellow and stunted for ten days, eight days, or even half a month. Therefore, attention must be paid to the technique of transplanting:

    1. The soil moisture must be fully saturated when transplanting. It is best to irrigate the seedlings heavily the day before planting, and then irrigate again the next morning before planting in the afternoon. This prevents the soil clod from dispersing during transplanting. Seedlings with four or five true leaves are best for transplanting.

    2. It is best to transplant in the afternoon, so that the sun does not damage the seedlings and they are less likely to need replacement.

    3. When transplanting, the soil clod should be as large and intact as possible (over two square inches). Be careful not to damage the seedling's young roots, especially the main root. When transplanting, first use a transplanting knife to cut around the four sides, and then insert the knife horizontally from below to lift the seedling out.

    4. When planting, whether it is planting in holes in a flatbed, digging trenches in a raised bed, or direct planting, some people water before and some after. Any method is acceptable. However, carefully place the transplanted soil clod into the hole and gently bury the loose soil around the soil clod, just enough to prevent the soil clod from tipping over. Be careful not to press the soil clod with your hands. This is a crucial point and a common mistake.

    5. After planting, water twice continuously, or even three times in dry weather, but two times is usually sufficient to ensure seedling survival. It is best to water in the morning or evening, and be careful to prevent muddy water from clouding the heart of the cabbage.

    Post-Planting Management

After planting the cabbage, regularly check for pests and diseases (pest and disease control methods will be introduced separately). The next steps are cultivating and weeding, applying top dressing, and watering. For the first cultivation of the live cabbage (no more watering after the seedlings survive), wait until the soil surface is slightly dry (when you can stand on the ground). The cultivation should be light and shallow, just enough to break the soil surface. The main purpose is to bury the cracks around the soil clod to prevent wind and dryness. Be careful not to break up the soil clod. Later, adjust the depth and frequency of cultivation depending on the situation. Deep and frequent cultivation is to promote the decomposition of the soil and facilitate the growth of fine roots, and pay attention to "prolonged drought" (what the common people call dundun, or some call hanhan).

Next, applying top dressing and watering: the time for applying top dressing should be between the White Dew and Autumn Equinox solar terms. Some people apply sesame residue, some black bean flour, some dried manure, etc. Any fertilizer is good. When applying, dig a half-circle small ditch around the cabbage plant, being careful not to injure the roots, about two inches away from the main root of the cabbage. After digging, apply the fertilizer according to the size of your land and the amount of manure you have, and then cover it with soil. Regarding the watering issue, if there is no time after applying the top dressing, it is okay to water a few days later (the first watering after applying top dressing). What must be paid attention to at this time is that once the first watering is done, the second watering must follow. If the first watering is done today, the second watering should be done tomorrow afternoon or the day after tomorrow afternoon, at the latest on the third day. Otherwise, the fertilizer in the ground will generate heat and the cabbage will turn yellow. This point is crucial. As the saying goes, "First watering late, second watering rush, third watering mottled face, fourth watering take a look." The meaning is: It doesn't matter if the first watering is late, the second watering must be rushed. When watering for the third time, the cabbage begins to form its head, so it is not dangerous to be off by a few days, but you should also water on time. When watering for the fourth time, you can water as needed depending on the drought situation. If it rains in between, it doesn't matter if you don't water the fourth time. Generally speaking, after applying top dressing, four waterings in a normal year can ensure the harvest. If you encounter a particularly dry year, you can also water five times.

Two methods for preventing rot: When people cut cabbage to eat, they sometimes find that when they cut it open, the inside is layer upon layer of soy sauce-like mud, and it smells bad. The common people say it is "soy sauce jar" (the common people see it as being like a jar of soy sauce). Sometimes, when they cut it open, the inside is layer upon layer of yellowish-white, although it does not smell bad, it cannot be chewed. The common people say it is "burnt heart cabbage" (the common people see it as being dry). The reason for these two manifestations is improper watering. The so-called "soy sauce jar" is mainly caused by excessive watering. The so-called "burnt heart" is mainly caused by not watering when it should be watered. Therefore, you must pay attention to watering at the right time.

　　栽管白菜的经验
    翟雨滋
    各地种白菜的方法各有不同，一种是种“子母”菜，即是把所要种的菜地都整好，一到立秋就开始播种。有的点种，有的条种，事后经多次搁苗，最后才定苗。这种方法各地比较普遍。另一种是，集中下种育苗，待苗长四五个食叶后，就开始施行移栽，这种方法在曲阳、康县、阜平、完县一带，群众都有习惯和成功的经验。以上两种方法，以后者较好。在防除虫病害及管理上，有好多好处，而且白菜成长良好。其经验如下：
    栽菜的方法
    许多人同样的都是栽菜，有的栽后并不换苗，一股劲就绿油油的长起来；有的栽后十天八天，甚至半月，黄潦潦的不长，因此必须注意移栽的技术：
    １、移苗时，土中的水分，必须充分饱满，栽苗最好在前一天，先灌一次大水，第二天上午再灌一次，下午栽。这样移苗时土胎不易分散，移栽的苗子以在四五个食叶时为最好。
    ２、移栽时间最好在下午，这样不致于使太阳把苗晒坏，而且也不致于换苗。
    ３、移苗时，土胎尽量要大要好（二寸见方以上），千万不要伤到苗的幼根，特别是主根。在移栽时先用移苗刀四边扎一下，然后从下边平刀扎进去，将苗起出来。
    ４、栽苗时无论是平畦挖坑栽，或畦中挑沟栽，或是硬栽，有的先灌水，有的后灌水，无论那种方法都可以。但均须把移好的苗胎，轻轻的放进坑去后，把四围的松土轻轻的向土胎周围稍埋一下，不使土胎偏倒就可。注意千万不要用手按土胎，此点最关重要，也是常犯的一点毛病。
    ５、栽好后，要连续浇水两次，旱时甚至三次，不过两次也足可保苗。浇水时间以早晨或傍晚为最好，并要注意泥水不使糊涂了菜心。
    栽后的管理
    白菜栽好后，应经常注意病虫害的检查工作（病虫害防除法另介绍）。其次就是中耕锄草，施追肥，上水等事情。栽活的白菜（苗活后就不再浇水），第一次施锄，要等地皮稍有干处（地内站住脚时就可），锄时须轻而浅，刚锄破地皮就可，主要是将苗胎周围的裂缝锄埋住，不使透风干裂。注意千万不要锄散土胎。以后可斟酌情况，逐渐深锄和多锄。深锄和多锄，就是为的促进土壤的分解，便利毛根的生长，并要注意“久旱”（老百姓叫墩墩，有的叫旱旱）。
    再次，施追肥和上水：施追肥时间，应在白露秋分节间。施肥有的施麻糁，有的施黑豆面，有的施大粪干等不同。无论施那种肥料都好，施时应在菜棵周围，挖一半圆形的小沟，不要伤到根子，离白菜主根约有两寸远就可。挖好后，根据自己的地劲大小和粪的多少酌情使用，施后即用土埋好。关于上水的问题，施好追肥后，如无时间，稍迟三两天上水也没关系（施追肥后的头水）。这时要注意的是，只要一上头水，二水也就得接着上，如今天上头水，明日下午或后天下午就上二水，最多等到第三天。否则，地下粪一发热，白菜就黄了，此点很关重要。常言说：“头水晚，二水赶，三水爆花脸，四水拉拉看。”意思就是：头水晚没关系，二水就要紧来赶。上三水时，白菜就开始包心了，稍错两天也没危险，不过也应按时浇水。上第四次水时，根据旱情，随便上水就可以了。如中间有雨，第四水不上也没关系。一般说来，施追肥后，平常年头浇四水就可保住收成，如遇特旱年，也可浇五水。
    两种腐烂病的防御法：老百姓切白菜吃时，当发现有的切开后，里边一层一层的成酱泥粥，并很臭。俗话说：“酱罐”了（老百姓是看它象成面酱的罐子）。有的切开后，里边一层一层的成黄白色，虽说不臭，但咬啮不动。俗话说：“烧心菜”（老百姓是看它象干的）。这两种表现，其原因都是上水不得当。所谓“酱罐”的原因，主要是浇水过多造成的。所谓“烧心”的原因，主要是应浇水时而不浇造成的。所以必须注意浇水适时。
