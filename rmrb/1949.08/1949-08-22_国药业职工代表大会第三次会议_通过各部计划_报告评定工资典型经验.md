[This City News] The Third Meeting of the National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Representative Conference was held on the 16th. Sixty representatives attended. At the meeting, Guo Caizhang, Deputy Director of the association, reported on the participation in the city's representative conference and its resolutions. Then, Cai Dongyong, representative of Xi Henian Tang, and others reported on the democratic wage assessment process, providing a typical experience for all representatives in wage assessment, breaking everyone's previous ideological concerns about the difficulty of wage assessment. Following this, the Executive Committee of the trade union reported on the work plans of the organization, propaganda and education, welfare, and production departments, submitting them to the conference for discussion and approval. The Organization Department will promote the establishment of formal trade unions in each pharmacy in August. It is stipulated in principle that pharmacies with 30 or more employees should establish trade unions; those with fewer than 30 employees should establish groups, and then several should jointly form a trade union by region. A total of 31 trade union organizations directly under the leadership of the Municipal National Pharmaceutical Industry Trade Union will be established throughout the city. The Propaganda and Education Department will improve the National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Literacy Class and strive to become a model workers' literacy school for various industries. The Welfare Department will expedite the establishment of a consumer cooperative to respond to the call of the representative of the cooperative headquarters at the conference of representatives from all walks of life, and to seek welfare for the city's 2,600 national pharmaceutical industry workers and their families. The Production Department will mobilize each company to formulate and implement specific agreements on collective contracts, democratically assess wages, and reform the past unreasonable wage system; and then mobilize the employees of each company to improve drug quality, actively produce, and work hard for the people's medical and health undertakings. The above work plans were discussed and approved. Finally, in order to realize the instruction of Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, at the National Trade Union Work Conference, that "everyone should run the trade union," all representatives decided to establish three working committees under the leadership of the Standing Committee: Fee Management, Welfare, and Production, each with five members, to be decided by the Standing Committee nominating seven people for everyone to elect. Each committee will also convene a meeting in the next few days to study specific work steps.
