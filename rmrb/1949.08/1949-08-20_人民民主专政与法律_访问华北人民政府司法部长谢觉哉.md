　　People's Democratic Dictatorship and the Law
    ——An Interview with Xie Juezai, Minister of Justice of the North China People's Government
    Jin Feng
    During the widespread study of Chairman Mao's July 1st essay "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" in various organs and schools, many people did not deeply understand the section on the role of the "state." This reporter specially visited Comrade Xie Juezai, Minister of Justice of the North China People's Government. When the reporter asked whether some students currently believed that studying law was unnecessary, and whether some old judicial and administrative personnel and old legal education workers also felt distressed and without a way out, Minister Xie laughed. He said: "On the contrary, the laws of New Democracy are laws that serve the broad masses of the people. How could they have no future? In the past, people who studied law only served as tools for reactionaries against the people. That is truly having no future!" Minister Xie quoted Chairman Mao's words from "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "Our present task is to strengthen the people's state apparatus, which refers mainly to the people's army, the people's police, and the people's courts, in order to protect national defense and the interests of the people. On this condition, China will be able to advance steadily from an agricultural country to an industrial country, from a new-democratic society to a socialist and communist society under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party." Minister Xie continued, "Look, how clearly Chairman Mao has stated it. At present, it is necessary to strengthen the role of law in order to carry out the tasks of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and maintaining the new social order." The reporter asked: In the future, when classes are eliminated, the state and the law will no longer exist. How will social order be maintained then? Minister Xie said, "When society enters socialism and communism, the articles of law will gradually lose their effectiveness. It, like other state apparatuses, will slowly die out." Minister Xie cited several interesting examples. He said, "All laws in the world have a death penalty, but the Soviet Union has now abolished the death penalty, because Soviet society has progressed to the point where it is no longer necessary to use the death penalty to suppress class enemies. For the same reason, the law of the death penalty can gradually die out, and the law of imprisonment can also gradually die out. In China, in the past, the 'county magistrate's' court was filled with various instruments of torture, beating the litigants to the point of 'one Buddha being born and two Buddhas entering Nirvana.' This is what I saw with my own eyes when I was a child. Now, hasn't torture been banned? Speaking of this, Minister Xie said in the optimistic tone of a communist that after the elimination of classes in the future, the task of law to suppress class enemies will have come to an end, but the task of maintaining order will still exist for a considerable period of time, because due to the influence of the old society, some people may still have bad behaviors and habits, which need to be corrected by law. Naturally, on the one hand, the transformation through cultural and educational institutions and the improvement of economic life are the basic conditions for promoting good behavior and habits among the people, just as paying attention to hygiene is the basic condition for maintaining good health. But if one gets sick, one must see a doctor, and the role of law is equivalent to that of a doctor. But the methods will become more civilized. For example, the current criticism and self-criticism may be one of the main ways to solve problems in the future courts. If a person commits an ordinary fault, the court gives public advice, which may also be considered a kind of punishment." Saying this, he laughed again.
    Minister Xie also talked about the new laws in the past liberated areas. Although some achievements have been explored, there are still very few written laws, which need to be further studied in the future, and experience should be gained from actual work. Therefore, studying new jurisprudence will be much more difficult than studying old jurisprudence in the past, but it will also be more glorious. In the past, it was "reciting scriptures from the book," but now, in addition to learning the basic principles of new jurisprudence in schools, it is also necessary to learn and create in actual work, constantly enriching the content of new jurisprudence and judicial work, and completing the systematic written law of the people's democratic country. He said solemnly, "This is an arduous task, and one of the important tasks needed by the people."

　　人民民主专政与法律
    ——访问华北人民政府司法部长谢觉哉
    金凤
    在各机关学校普遍学习毛主席七一论文“论人民民主专政”时，关于“国家”的作用这部分，许多人体会不深刻，记者特走访华北人民政府司法部长谢觉哉同志。当记者问到目前有些学生以为学法律是不需要的了，一部分旧司法行政人员和旧法学教育工作者也感到苦闷无出路时，谢部长笑了起来。他说：“正相反，新民主主义的法律是为广大人民服务的法律，怎会没有前途？以前学法律的人只是当反动派反人民的工具，那才是真正没有前途！”谢部长引用了毛主席“论人民民主专政”中的语句：“我们现在的任务是要强化人民的国家机器，这主要是指人民的军队，人民的警察和人民的法庭，借以保护国防和保护人民利益，以此为条件，使中国有可能在工人阶级及共产党领导之下，稳步地由农业国进到工业国，由新民主主义社会进到社会主义社会与共产主义社会。”谢部长接着说：“你看，毛主席说得何等清楚，目前正要加强法律的作用，以执行镇压反革命和维持新社会秩序的任务。”记者问：将来阶级消灭了，国家与法律都不存在，那时候社会秩序将怎样维持呢？谢部长说：“社会进入了社会主义和共产主义，法律一条条条文将逐渐失去效用，它和其他的国家机器一样，慢慢的死亡了。”谢部长引用了几个有趣的例子。他说：“世界法律上都有一条死刑，但苏联现在是废除死刑了，那是因为苏联社会已进步到不需要用死刑来镇压阶级敌人了。同样的理由，死刑的法律，可以逐渐死去，徒刑的法律也是可以逐渐死去的。在中国，从前“县老爷”的大堂上摆着各种刑具，把诉讼人打得“一佛出世，二佛涅盘”，这是我小时亲眼看到的。现在不是已禁止刑讯了么？说到这里，谢部长以共产主义者的乐观语调说到将来阶级消灭以后法律的镇压阶级敌人的任务已告终止，但维持秩序的任务仍会在相当时间内存在，因为由于旧社会的影响，一部分人还可能有不良的行为和习惯，需要法律加以纠正。自然，一方面由文化教育机关进行改造和经济生活的提高是促使人民具有良好的行为和习惯的基本条件，正如进究卫生是保持身体健康的基本条件一样。但假如生了病则必然要请医生医治，法律的作用正相当于医生。但方式将日趋文明。譬如现在的批评和自我批评，就可能是将来法庭上解决问题的主要方式之一。人犯了普通过失，法庭给予当众劝告，恐怕也算一种处罚了。”说着他又笑了起来。
    谢部长又谈到过去解放区的新法律，虽然已摸索得到一些成绩，但成文法律还很少，需要今后继续研究，和从实际工作中取得经验。因此学习新法学将比过去学旧法学困难得多，但也光荣得多了，过去是“照本念经”，现在则除了在学校中学习新法学的基本原则以外，还要到实际工作中学习创造，不断充实新法学和司法工作的内容，并完成人民民主国家的系统的成文法。他严肃地说：“这是一桩艰巨的工作，是人民所需要的重要工作之一。”
