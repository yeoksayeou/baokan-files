Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 14th -- TASS, Bucharest, 12th -- Free Greece Radio broadcast a communique from the Supreme Command of the Democratic Army on the 12th, stating: Fierce fighting that began on August 10th in Vissa is continuing. Royalist fascist troops are throwing large numbers of infantry, artillery, armored vehicles, and air force into the battle.

On the 11th, Free Greece Radio broadcast a supplementary communique from the Supreme Command of the Greek Democratic Army, stating: On the evening of August 7th, attacks by the Royalist fascist army at Bigadiki, Tiotoko, and Zirsha were repelled. In western Grammos, the Royalist fascist army launched another offensive on the 9th. The enemy's attack was repelled, and the Democratic Army forces then launched a counteroffensive, causing the enemy to flee in disarray. Retreating enemy units suffered heavy losses under their own artillery fire, which was intended to stop the chaotic retreat of the Royalist fascist "soldiers." Enemy losses are estimated at 250 killed and 400 wounded. Enemy equipment abandoned is being counted.

The Royalist fascist army has not resumed its offensive in the Charno area after suffering heavy losses on August 7th. The area is littered with the corpses of Royalist fascist soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 14th -- TASS, Sofia -- The Fatherland Front newspaper published a declaration from the First Congress of the Greek Democratic Women's Federation on the 10th, announcing the establishment of the Greek Democratic Women's Federation in the liberated areas of Greece. The 323 delegates attending the conference urged Greek women in the declaration to fight for a peaceful people's democracy. The declaration stated: "Due to the plunder of our country by American and British imperialists, we have been unable to heal the wounds inflicted on our country during the Hitlerite occupation. Under the guise of 'aid,' the U.S. and Britain are destroying Greece with bombs, tanks, and artillery, and organizing the search and brutal killing of patriots of our motherland." The declaration emphasized that Greek women represent a tremendous force in the sacred struggle for national liberation. Hundreds of thousands of our sisters, standing in the ranks of the Democratic Army soldiers, are fighting the enemy with unparalleled courage, writing a glorious chapter in the history of the Greek people's liberation. The declaration pointed out: The establishment of the Greek Democratic Women's Federation in the liberated areas of Greece connects the free Greek women with peace-loving democratic women all over the world. The declaration concluded: Greek women, fighting shoulder to shoulder with all the people against the imperialist aggressors, will never allow their country to be turned into a base for attacking other countries.
