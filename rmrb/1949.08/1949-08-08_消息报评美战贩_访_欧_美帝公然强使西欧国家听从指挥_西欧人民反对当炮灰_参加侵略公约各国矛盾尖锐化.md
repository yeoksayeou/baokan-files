Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 7th: TASS Moscow dispatch: The "News" published on the 6th an international commentary entitled "American Generals in Western Europe" stating: If before the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty, the members of the Western European parliaments, American politicians, and newspapers were accustomed to talking noisily about the so-called "North Atlantic International Federation," now they no longer conceal that "American national interests" are their only motivation, and strictly speaking, the North Atlantic Treaty was established to suit these interests. The American imperialist group does not hesitate to openly regard Western Europe as their military fortress and supplier of "cannon fodder."

Referring to American interference in the internal affairs of Western European countries, the "News" recalled the recent statement by American Secretary of Defense Johnson. Johnson declared: The United States holds the military secrets of Western European countries. Information that would require thousands of American spies to work hard to obtain in other circumstances is now voluntarily handed over to the American imperialists by the governments of Western European countries. However, at the same time, when Britain just hinted that it hoped to obtain information about atomic energy from the United States, it was countered by its American allies.

The most severe decree is revealed in the imaginary "North Atlantic International Federation" related to the arrival of the US Chiefs of Staff in Western Europe. The chiefs of staff of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force came to Western Europe to familiarize themselves with the military situation of their satellite countries and to impose the conditions of American "military aid" on these countries. As can be seen from newspaper commentaries, American soldiers demand "coordinated action" and "unified command," and strive to disarm Western European countries before the American "cold" aggression, so that the military strength of Western European countries is subject to American command. American soldiers mainly rely on turning West Germany into their military fortress. At the same time, they demand that their allies actually abolish their independent armies. That is to say, to realize the cannibalistic American Senator Connally's "theory," which says: the United States supplies Western Europe with military equipment, while Western Europe must become the main cannon fodder supplier for American imperialism.

According to the London Times, the chiefs of staff of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force insisted on establishing a "unified, all-encompassing military organization" under American protection, in which Britain must play the role of a junior partner. The current issue is to dissolve the military organization established by the signatories of the Brussels Treaty and chaired by Britain into the military organization of the North Atlantic Alliance led by the United States.

The contradictions between Western European countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty are intensifying. American imperialists want to turn European nations and European countries into slaves employed by them, while the British ruling group first wants to turn France into a slave employed by itself. However, the French ruling class is faced with national indignation, and it has to show at least some pretense of resistance to the attempt to turn France into a "cannon fodder" supplier.

The "News" concluded by saying: The visit of the U.S. Chiefs of Staff to Western Europe more clearly shows the aggressive purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty and shows the Western European countries what the American warmongers are preparing for them. This "visit" has aroused a new and more powerful wave of popular indignation in all Western European countries. The people are unwilling to become slaves employed by foolish seekers of world hegemony.

### 消息报评美战贩“访”欧  美帝公然强使西欧国家听从指挥  西欧人民反对当炮灰  参加侵略公约各国矛盾尖锐化

    消息报评美战贩“访”欧
    美帝公然强使西欧国家听从指挥
    西欧人民反对当炮灰
    参加侵略公约各国矛盾尖锐化
    【新华社北平七日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报于六日刊载题为“美国将军们在西欧”的国际评论称：如果在批准北大西洋公约以前，西欧议会的议员们、美国政客们和报纸惯于嘈杂地谈论所谓“北大西洋国际联邦”的话，那么，现在他们已不再掩饰“美国的国家利益”是他们唯一的动机，而且严格说来，北大西洋公约是为适合这些利益而建立的。美国帝国主义集团对于公然把西欧当作他们的军事堡垒和“炮灰”供给者并不踌躇。
    谈到美国干涉西欧国家的内政时，消息报回溯美国国防部长詹森最近的声明。詹森宣称：美国手中握有西欧国家的军事秘密。在别种场合需要好几千个美国间谍辛苦努力才能得到的情报，现在都被西欧各国政府自愿地交给美国帝国主义者。可是，在同时，当英国刚刚暗示希望从美国获得关于原子能的情报是有利的时候，它就遭到了它的美国盟友的反击。
    最严厉的敕令，透露于与美国三军参谋长抵达西欧有关的想象的“北大西洋国际联邦”中。美国陆、海、空军参谋长来到西欧，以熟悉他们的卫星国的军事情况，并把美国的“军事援助”条件强加于这些国家。从报纸评论中可以看出，美国军人要求“配合行动”，“统一指挥”，力图使西欧国家在美国“冷”的侵略之前解除武装，使西欧国家的军力听从美国指挥。美国军人主要依靠着把德国西部地区变成他们的军事堡垒。同时，他们要求他们的盟国实际上取消他们的独立军队。这就是说，实现吃人肉的美国参议员康农的“理论”，这个“理论”说：美国以军事装备供给西欧，而西欧则必须成为美国帝国主义的主要炮灰供给者。
    据伦敦泰晤士报说，美国陆、海、空军参议长坚持在美国保护之下设立“统一的、包罗一切的军事组织”，英国在其中必须担任小伙计的角色。当前的问题是，把布鲁塞尔条约之签字国所建立而由英国坐第一把交椅的军事组织，溶解在美国领导的北大西洋联盟的军事组织中。
    参加北大西洋公约的西欧国家之间的矛盾，正在严重化。美国帝国主义者想把欧洲民族、欧洲国家变成他们所雇用的奴仆，而英国统治集团方面则首先想把法国变成自己所雇用的奴仆。但是，法国统治阶级面临着全国的愤慨，它不得不对把法国变成“炮灰”供给者的企图至少表示若干假装的抵抗。
    消息报最后说：美国三军参谋长的访问西欧，更加清楚地表明了北大西洋公约的侵略目的，并向西欧国家显示了：美国战争贩子正给他们准备什么东西。这一“访问”，已在西欧所有国家中引起了新的、更强有力的人民的愤慨浪潮。人民不愿成为愚蠢的世界霸权要求者所雇用的奴仆。
