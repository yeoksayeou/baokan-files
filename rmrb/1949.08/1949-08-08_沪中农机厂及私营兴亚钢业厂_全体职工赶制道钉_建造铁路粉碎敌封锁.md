    All Employees Rush to Produce Rail Spikes
    Build Railways and Smash Enemy Blockade
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] Shanghai workers are determined to work hard in production to smash the imperialist blockade. All employees of the China Agricultural Machinery Company's General Factory established a "Night Attack Team" and launched a production blitz. Since the factory accepted an order for 100,000 rail spikes and 15,000 sets of screws for the Huainan Railway on July 13th, it officially started work on August 1st. On the first night, many employees were handling iron pliers for the first time. Everyone invited an engineer to be the foreman and rehearsed. The next night, they produced 3,150 rail spikes in four hours, with each person's production approaching the output of skilled workers during the day. The cold-working factory, the design department's experimental factory, all used their lathes to participate in the screw production work. The forging factory, the main force of the blitz, saw workers, apprentices, and employees working enthusiastically in the high temperature of over 110 degrees, sweating profusely. They excitedly recorded on the blackboard: 4,100 pieces in the morning, 2,200 pieces at 2:30 pm, 3,500 pieces at 3:50 pm... One worker said: Because making rail spikes was a first for the General Factory, they only made 570 pieces during the trial work on July 31st. On the third day, they reached 5,650 pieces, and then the daily production increased to 11,000 pieces! Moreover, after inspection, the quality was not reduced. The private Xingya Steel Factory has also fully resumed work, rushing to produce 120,000 rail spikes for the Huainan Railway. On the 6th, all 110-plus workers in the factory came to the factory, using a new work attitude to rush to produce rail spikes for the Huainan Railway, to develop inland transportation and smash the bandit gang's blockade.

    建造铁路粉碎敌封锁
    【本报讯】上海职工决心努力生产，粉碎帝国主义的封锁。中国农业机械公司总厂全体职工成立“夜袭队”，展开突击生产。该厂自七月十三日接受淮南铁路道钉十万只，螺丝一万五千副定货以来，八月一日已正式开工。第一天晚上很多职员还是第一次拿铁钳的，大家请了工程师做领班，排演一番，第二天晚上即在四个钟头中制出道钉三千一百五十只，每人生产已接近白天熟练工人的生产量。冷作工厂、设计处实验工厂，都就各该厂能用车床，参加制螺丝钉工作。突击主力的锻工厂，工人、学徒、职员在一百十几度的室内高温中流着汗水热烈的工作，他们兴奋地在黑板上记着：上午四千一百只，下午二时三十分二千二百只，三时五十分三千五百只……，一位工人说：因为做道钉在总厂还是第一次，在上月三十一日试工时他们仅做五百七十只，第三天即达五千六百五十只，以后每日即增至一万一千只了！而且经过检验合格，质量并不降低。私营兴亚钢业厂亦已全部复工，赶制淮南路十二万只道钉的定货，六日全厂百十余工人都到厂，以新的劳动态度，赶制淮南路道钉，来发展内地交通，粉碎匪帮封锁。
