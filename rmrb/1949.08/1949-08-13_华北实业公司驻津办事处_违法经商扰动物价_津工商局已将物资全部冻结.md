    Tianjin Office of North China Industrial Company
    Illegally Engages in Business and Disturbs Commodity Prices
    Tianjin Industry and Commerce Bureau Freezes All Goods
    [Tianjin Dispatch] The Tianjin office of the North China Industrial Company was found to be illegally dealing in flour in Tianjin, and also contributing to price fluctuations in the city. The Tianjin Industry and Commerce Bureau investigated and found this out recently and has temporarily frozen all its goods, and is currently processing the matter. It is understood that the North China Industrial Company is a production organization under the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region, with its headquarters in Shijiazhuang. Its business scope includes soap, cigarettes, iron factories, etc. The task of the company's Tianjin office is to purchase raw materials and promote finished products. The North China government allows the operation of factories and the establishment of sales departments for purchasing raw materials and promoting finished products, but does not allow government agencies to engage in commerce, nor to use purchasing and sales departments to engage in commerce. On the 25th day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar, Li Zifan, the director of the company's Beijing office, sent salesman Wang Chunqi to Xuzhou with 5.75 million RMB to purchase wheat. After the wheat arrived in Tianjin, it was exchanged privately with the private Fu Feng Flour Mill for 900 bags of flour, without going through the state-owned trading company. During the price fluctuations at the end of last month, when the price of flour in Beijing was higher than in Tianjin (9,000 RMB per bag in Tianjin, 15,000 RMB per bag in Beijing), the company planned to transport the flour to Beijing for sale in order to obtain huge profits. The Industry and Commerce Bureau clarified the above situation on the 29th of last month. This behavior of the company's office not only violates the regulations of the North China Industry and Commerce Department prohibiting government agencies from engaging in trade, but also exceeds its business scope and contributes to price fluctuations. Therefore, the Industry and Commerce Bureau has temporarily frozen all its goods and submitted a request to the North China People's Government for instructions on how to handle the matter.
    It is reported that a considerable number of public organs and agencies from various regions have come to Tianjin to purchase materials without following legal procedures, exceeding their business scope, and even colluding with private merchants to hoard and speculate, which has contributed to price fluctuations. In order to stabilize commodity prices and crack down on illegal activities by personnel of public procurement departments, the Tianjin Industry and Commerce Bureau is not only strengthening management measures in procurement but also conducting inspections of the aforementioned illegal activities. The illegal incident of the North China Industrial Company's office is only one of them, and many other cases are under investigation.

    华北实业公司驻津办事处
    违法经商扰动物价
    津工商局已将物资全部冻结
    【天津电】华北实业公司驻津办事处在本市违法经营面粉，且助长津市物价波动，经本市工商局于日前查出，已将其全部物资暂时冻结，正进行处理中，查华北实业公司是华北军区后勤司令部的生产组织机构，公司设石家庄，其经营范围有肥皂、纸烟、铁工厂等。该公司驻津办事处任务为采购原料与推销成品。经营工厂和设立收购原料和推销成品的门市部，华北政府的法令是允许的，但不准机关经营商业，亦不准利用购销门市部经营商业。旧历五月二十五日，该公司驻平办事处主任李子范派业务员王春祺带人民币五百七十五万元赴徐州采购小麦，俟购至津后，不经国营贸易公司，即私自与私营福丰粉厂交换面粉九百袋，在上月底物价波动期间，北平面粉价高于本市时（本市九千元一袋，北平一万五千元一袋）又拟运平出售以求获取厚利。以上情况，工商局已于上月二十九日查明。该公司办事处此种行为既违反华北工商部不许机关作买卖的规定，同时经营又超出范围，助长物价波动，故已由工商局将其全部物资暂时冻结，呈请华北人民政府指示予以处理。
    按各地各机关公营机关来津采购物资，不按法定手续进行，超出经营范围，甚至勾结私商囤积投机者为数不少，助长了物价的波动，本市工商局为平稳物价，取缔公营采购部门人员违法事项，除加强采购方面的管理办法外，并进行对上述不法事项之检查，华北实业公司办事处违法事件只是其中之一件，尚有许多案件在调查处理中。
