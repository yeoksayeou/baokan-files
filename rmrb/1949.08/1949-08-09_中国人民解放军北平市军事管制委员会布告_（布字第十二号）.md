    Proclamation of the Beijing Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    (Bu Zi No. 12)
    It has been found that recently, public-owned industrial and commercial enterprises, and institutions and schools from various regions purchasing materials in this city have largely failed to abide by the regulations of the North China People's Government, and have not conducted purchases through trade companies. This has allowed unscrupulous merchants to take the opportunity to engage in speculative activities, disrupting the market and greatly affecting prices in this city. In order to rectify this state of anarchy, it is hereby decided that all public-owned enterprises or trade units from various regions, or administrative organizations stationed in Beijing, as well as production departments of various levels of institutions in Beijing, that need to purchase materials in the market of this city, whether they have already completed the purchase or are preparing to purchase, must register with the Beijing Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau within one week from the date of this proclamation, accurately reporting the types, quantities, and uses of the materials to be purchased, and establish contact with the Beijing Municipal Trade Company. Violators will be dealt with according to the law. This is hereby proclaimed.
            Director: Ye Jianying
              August 7th, 38th Year of the Republic of China
