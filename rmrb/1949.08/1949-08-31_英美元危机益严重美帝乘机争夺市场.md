The "High-Level Financial Conference" between the United States, Britain, and Canada is scheduled to begin in Washington on September 6th, with preliminary meetings having commenced on August 27th. This conference was proposed by Britain. When the British Labour government completed its second-quarter accounts in early July, it discovered that its total gold and dollar reserves had dwindled to a mere £406 million. Consequently, it requested this conference, hoping to increase dollar loans and expand British exports to the dollar area to salvage its critically depleted dollar reserves. However, Britain's calculation has completely misfired. Ruthless U.S. imperialism is plotting to break the pound sterling bloc and seize markets in the sterling area to delay its own economic crisis. Therefore, in recent months, a fierce "preliminary battle" has unfolded between the U.S. and Britain, the creditor and debtor, surrounding the preparations for this "High-Level Financial Conference." The U.S. has launched an intimidating public opinion offensive against Britain, demanding the free convertibility of the pound sterling and pressuring it to devalue, day after day. U.S. Republican Senator Kem declared publicly on the 22nd: "When Bevin and Cripps arrive in Washington, I will tell them: there will be no more dollars until you take measures to help yourselves." The British government, which has always relied on the alms of its American master, cannot help but resist the U.S., at least verbally. British Labour MP Aubrey even declared in a speech in London on the 23rd: "We would rather risk the threat of enlightened communism than be manipulated by uncouth, bloated American financial tycoons."

　　英美元危机益严重美帝乘机争夺市场
    美英加三国“高级金融会议”，已定于九月六日起在华盛顿举行，其预备会议已于八月二十七日开始。这个会议是由英国提议召开的，英国工党政府在七月初旬完成其第二季结算时，发现全部黄金与美元储备仅剩四亿零六百万镑，因此要求召开这个会议，希望增加美元贷款，并扩大英国货在美元区的出口，以挽救其濒于枯竭的严重的美元危机。然而英国的这个算盘完全打错了。无情的美帝国主义正阴谋击破英镑集团，夺取英镑区市场，来延缓本身的经济危机。因此近月以来，围绕着准备召开这个“高级金融会议”的周围，展开了美英这个债主和债户的激烈的“前哨战”。美国向英国展开了一个恫吓性的舆论攻势，一天紧似一天地要求英镑自由兑换，压迫英镑贬值。美国共和党参议员肯姆二十二日公开说：“当贝文和克利浦斯到达华盛顿时，我将对他们说：在你们采取措施帮助你们自己以前，再也没有美元了。”一向靠美国主人布施过活的英国政府也至少不能不在口头上对美国进行抵抗。英国工党国会议员奥勃利恩二十三日在伦敦演说时甚至宣称：“我们宁可冒开明的共产主义的威胁，而不愿受无文化的大腹便便的美国金融大王摆布。”
