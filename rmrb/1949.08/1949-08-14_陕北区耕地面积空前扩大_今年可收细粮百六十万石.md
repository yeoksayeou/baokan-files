    [Broadcast by Xi'an People's Broadcasting Station on the 13th] Yan'an News: Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the 1.7 million working people in the Shaanbei District of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have expanded the cultivated land area to over 16.5 million mu this year. This not only reaches the area before the Chiang Kai-shek/Hu Zongnan bandit gang attacked Yan'an, but also exceeds the highest amount of cultivated land during the peaceful construction period of the Border Region in 1946 by 10%, which was 15 million mu. It is estimated that 1.6 million shi of fine grains can be harvested. This not only provides for the restoration and improvement of people's living conditions, but also directly contributes to supporting the front lines. The reasons for this great achievement in northern Shaanxi this year are: First, the victory of the People's Liberation Army has inspired the peasants' enthusiasm for production; Second, thorough land reform has been carried out in most areas, and producers have gained ownership of the main means of production; Third, the Party and government have deeply led the spring plowing and land reclamation work; Fourth, extensive mutual aid in labor has been carried out among the masses; Fifth, a reasonable burden policy has been announced. According to incomplete statistics, 40% of the more than 370,000 laborers in the region participated in spring plowing mutual aid. This powerful labor combination is the decisive force for expanding the cultivated land area. In addition, the People's Government promptly led the solution of difficulties encountered by farmers in the production and means of subsistence during the spring plowing period.

    陕北区耕地面积空前扩大
    今年可收细粮百六十万石
    【西安人民广播电台十三日广播】延安消息：陕甘宁边区陕北区的一百七十多万劳动人民在共产党和人民政府领导下，今年耕地面积，扩大到一千六百五十余万亩，不仅达到了蒋胡匪帮进攻延安前的面积，而且超过了一九四六年边区和平建设时期耕地面积最高数量一千五百万亩的百分之十，估计可收获细粮一百六十万石。不但提供了恢复和改善人民的生活条件，同时直接有助于支援前线。陕北区今年得到这样最大成绩的原因：一是解放军的胜利，鼓舞了农民生产的情绪；二是绝大部分地区进行了彻底的土地改革，生产者占有了主要生产条件；三是党政深入的领导春耕、开荒工作；四是群众间进行了广泛地劳动互助；五是公布了合理负担政策。据不完全统计，全区三十七万多劳动力中，有百分之四十参加春耕变工，这个强大的劳动组合力量，是扩大耕地面积的决定力量。此外，人民政府在春耕期间，及时领导解决农民春耕中生产和生活资料的困难。
