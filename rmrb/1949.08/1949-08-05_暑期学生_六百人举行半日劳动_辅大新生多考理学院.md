    Fu Jen University Freshmen Mostly Apply to Science Departments
    ▲ With the assistance of the Fifth District Government, the Education Department of Fu Jen University has established a women's literacy class. The address is within the Moral Society in Yangfang Hutong. Currently, there are over 40 students enrolled, divided into two classes, A and B, according to their level. They study cultural and political courses, focusing mainly on practical skills such as bookkeeping, writing notes, and writing letters.

    ▲ The application deadline for Fu Jen University's enrollment this year has passed. A total of 1,294 people have applied to the Faculties of Arts, Science, and Education. The Faculty of Science has the highest number of applicants, with nearly 700 applying. The examination dates are from August 4th to 6th.

    ▲ The Fu Jen University Children's Night School, the Third Street Children's Night School in the Fifth District, and the Drum Tower Children's Paradise, all organized by the Education Department of Fu Jen University, with a total of over 400 students, held a joint celebration in the auditorium of the Second Faculty of Fu Jen University at 3:00 PM one day. Parents of students also participated. Each class had a performance of recreational activities. The atmosphere between teachers, students, and parents was very harmonious. A student representative said, "We are willing to study hard under the education of teachers and become useful people for the new China." (Fu Jen University Correspondent Group)

    ▲ The Southeast District of the Youth Academy held a half-day of labor on the afternoon of the 4th, with more than 600 students participating. This time, the Second Boys' Middle School, Senior Business School, Yuying, Xinsheng, and Datong schools were responsible for removing garbage from the academy. Beiman, Muzhen, Huiwen, and the Fourth Girls' Middle School were responsible for cleaning classrooms and the library. Shandong Middle School was responsible for cleaning the dining hall. Xinsheng Jingcun Xinqing, Tiejianshe, and others were responsible for clearing weeds in the academy. During the work, all the students were very focused and excited and happy. Through this labor, many students have a better understanding of the true meaning of "labor creates the world."

    ▲ Students from the Third Sub-Group of the Study Group saw that the road from the Senior High School Department to the Junior High School Department of Yuying High School was muddy and difficult to walk on after the rain, so they spontaneously picked up furniture and started repairing it. The atmosphere in the studio was tense and pleasant. A female student with poor physical strength, although very tired from her studies, still persisted until the road was repaired. Recently, the students have been very happy to work because they are determined to establish a labor perspective in their work and use their own hands to transform their environment.

    六百人举行半日劳动
    辅大新生多考理学院
    ▲辅大教育系在内五区区政府协助下筹办了一个妇女识字班。地址在羊房胡同道德会内。现已报名学生四十余人，按程度分为甲乙两班；学习文化课及政治课。主要的是教些实际用的东西，象教她们记帐、写便条、写信……等。
    ▲辅大本年度招生报名已经截止，文、理、教育三院报名人数共计一千二百九十四人。以报考理学院者最多，将近七百人报名。考试日期为八月四日至六日。
    ▲辅大教育系主办的辅大儿童夜校、内五区三街儿童夜校、鼓楼儿童乐园共四百多学生，一日下午三点钟在辅大二院礼堂开了一个三校联欢会，并有学生家长参加。每一个班都有游艺节目表演。师生和儿童家长间的情绪非常融洽。学生代表说：“愿在教师教育下努力学习，成为新中国有用的人。”（辅大通讯组）
    ▲青年学园东南区四日下午举行了一次半日劳动，参加的同学共有六百多人。这次男二中、高商、育英、新生、大同等校负责除去学园里的垃圾；贝满、慕贞、汇文、女四中等校负责打扫教室及图书室，山东中学负责打扫饭厅，新生竞存新青，铁键社等负责清除学园内的野草。工作的时候，全体同学都很紧张，却又感到兴奋和愉快。经过这次劳动，许多同学对“劳动创造世界”的真义更了解了。

    ▲学习团第三分团的同学看到由育英高中部到初中部的道路雨后积水泥泞难行，便纷纷自动的拿起家具，动手起来修理。工作室同学的情绪紧张愉快，有一体力较差的女同学虽然功课很累了，但仍然坚持下去，一直到道路修好。同学们在近来都很欢喜劳动，因为决心要在工作中建立劳动观点；并用自己的手来改造自己的环境。  （分团通讯组）
