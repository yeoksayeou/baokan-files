Handan Transportation Company Examines Car Accident Incident and Responds to This Newspaper

　　This newspaper published articles on July 19th and 21st criticizing the Handan Transportation Company for car accidents, requesting the company to make a public self-criticism and reply. The company's self-criticism materials are now published in summary as follows:

To the Editor:

　　We have read the criticism of us in the People's Daily (July 19th). We sincerely accept it and have conducted a serious and profound self-examination. While we were studying the causes of the car accidents and the handling process, we saw the criticism of us by the People's Supervision Yuan published on page 2 of the People's Daily on July 21st. At that time, we temporarily put aside other work and focused on thoroughly investigating the responsibility for the incident and the shortcomings in the handling process. After receiving the notice from the Supervision Yuan on July 31st, we held an internal expanded cadre meeting to further analyze the responsibility for the incident. We now report the materials we have compiled as follows:

　　I. Accident Situation and Handling Results:

　　(1) At 6:00 AM on April 24th (the newspaper said 7:00 AM), a company car left for Linqing. When it reached the west of Chunchang Village, it ran over and killed Shi Qingyun, a correspondent of the Handan County Government. After the incident, the driver, Zhang Zhifu, moved the body to the side of the road and covered it with a mat. Several letters were found on the body, so he drove the car back to the company and reported the incident. The company, upon learning from the letters that the deceased was a staff member of the Handan County Government, sent someone to escort the car's driver, assistant, and apprentice to the Handan Municipal Government to surrender to the local government authorities. At the same time, they sent cadres to the Handan County Government to report the truth and dispatched someone to guard the body at the scene of the accident. After learning about the situation, the Municipal Government inquired in detail about the circumstances of the car accident from the four passengers on the car, and each of the four signed and sealed the transcript of the conversation, and then detained the driver Zhang Zhifu. The company, together with the special district, municipal, and county governments, conducted a detailed study at the scene of the accident. The company immediately purchased clothing and a coffin to encoffinate the deceased, found a car to send it to the deceased's hometown of Gejia Village in Yongnian, and also paid 400 catties of millet for burial expenses. On the day of the funeral, the company sent someone to Gejia Village to express condolences to the deceased's family. The company's total expenses were approximately 1,000 catties of millet. The driver was sentenced to four years in prison by the government.

　　(2) On May 13th, the driver of vehicle No. 16, Liu Yintai, had a quarrel with a cart driver in Cangxian. He gathered more than 20 workers from the company and severely beat the cart driver near Changzhuang. The company only found out about it after the incident because the company's responsible comrades were holding an administrative meeting. Because the matter involved government security, the workers were summoned for interrogation. As a result, Liu Yintai was detained. The company manager personally apologized and offered condolences to the cart workers in Cangxian, and compensated 100,000 Jiao (Jibi) for livestock injury medical expenses. The driver was sentenced to two months of detention by the government.

　　(3) On May 20th, the car hit a cart about 20 li east of Yongnian, damaging the car's water tank. At that time, the car was not driving fast, so they reasoned with the cart worker, asking him to compensate for the loss. However, the cart worker was unreasonable. Coincidentally, there were 21 comrades from the veterinary team on the car, and they were outraged by the cart worker's unreasonableness, so they all started reasoning with him. The cart worker, realizing he was in the wrong, was willing to take the car to the company to explain the situation, take responsibility for repairing the water tank, and be responsible for the fare from Yongnian City East to Handan. The car later encountered an ox, and drove away without compensating or apologizing to the farmer. When it came to the west of Laimatai Village, it encountered Yang Chunrong, a farmer, and his mule. Yang Chunrong led the mule to the north side of the road, but because the mule was afraid of the car and jumped around, Yang lost control and bumped into the front right side panel of the car. The car knocked the person down, and the rear wheels ran over his buttocks and back, breaking his ribs and crushing his head (according to the judgment of the Handan County Government). After this incident, the driver went to the nearby Handan County Government to turn himself in, and reported to the company on the other hand. The company then sent cadres to drive to the scene of the accident, studied the situation with the government, and followed the government's order to purchase clothing and a coffin for the deceased, spending a total of 600 catties of millet for burial. The driver, Li Xizhen, was sentenced to six months in prison by the government.

　　II. Our Own Handling and Self-Criticism of the Incident:

　　(1) After the Zhang Zhifu incident, the car department management believed that, apart from objective reasons, killing someone was indeed a serious problem. They immediately used this incident to educate the workers, explaining the seriousness of the matter. They explained that driver Zhang Zhifu was not careful enough while driving and should not have moved the body after the accident. At that time, the workers' emotions fluctuated, and they were afraid to drive anymore. They asked to be repair workers. The leadership immediately stabilized the workers' emotions, conveyed the responsibility for car accidents promulgated by the higher authorities, and educated the workers to pay more attention when driving in the future, drive slowly in crowded places, and honk the horn. If it was still difficult to drive, they should stop the car. As long as there were no accidents, it would take two days instead of one. In this way, the workers' emotions slowly stabilized. The handling of driver Zhang Zhifu was left to the government's judgment.

　　(2) After the problem of Liu Yintai gathering people to beat someone occurred, we first believed that collective beating was even more serious than the Zhang incident. We immediately convened a meeting of all workers. At that time, evil spirits were rampant among the workers. When asked who participated in the beating, everyone admitted to participating. The leadership first broke the destructive group, deeply understood the truth, and found out who participated in the beating. Then, they conducted group discussions, clarified responsibilities, and launched self-criticism. The leadership then collected the materials and used a class-like method to educate the workers. The government's handling of Liu Yintai was relatively severe. The workers made a guarantee that they would never commit similar things again, otherwise they would be willing to be punished. Therefore, the worker masses were not punished. Two party members who participated in the beating were punished (one of them was suspended from work and asked to write a written reflection). Until Liu Yintai was released from the government, the leadership made a summary of the beating problem and convened a second worker congress, conducted a public warning, and once again emphasized the opposition to unorganized, undisciplined, leaderless, and anarchic styles.

　　(3) After the Li Xizhen incident occurred, it aroused serious attention among the workers. The leadership once again pointed out that three incidents in a row proved that the workers were too careless and their mass concept was too sloppy, which made the workers vigilant in their thinking. It also stipulated the load capacity of the cars: 35 people for large trucks and 30 people for small trucks. When there are people on the opposite side while driving, the speed must be reduced. If the other party can avoid it, then drive slowly past. If the other party does not avoid it, we must stop the car. Then, analyze the incident to see if it can be avoided. Everyone believes that if vigilance is high, seeing that livestock is afraid of the car and stopping the car, it can be avoided. The handling of Li Xizhen was left to the government's opinion.

　　We believe that the continuous occurrence of the above incidents is a direct violation of government laws and regulations and relations with the masses, proving that our education is very inadequate. We have not or have rarely strengthened the workers' mass concept education, and have not made them realize that the people's transportation cause cannot be done well without the enthusiastic help of the broad masses. Strengthening the education of workers and strengthening their mass viewpoint is the direction of the automobile workers' work in the future. This is also a problem that the entire company from top to bottom should often attach importance to in thinking and work in the future. We can only redouble our efforts to make up for past losses and improve our work to answer the Party newspaper's hopes for us. We hope to provide better and more valuable opinions to help us.

　　With best regards,

　　Handan Transportation Company

　　邯郸运输公司检查汽车肇祸事件答复本报
    本报于今年七月十九、二十一两日连续发表批评邯郸运输公司汽车肇祸的稿件，要求该公司公开检讨答复。现将该公司检讨材料择要发表如后：编辑同志：
    我们看到人民日报（七月十九日）对于我们的批评，我们完全诚恳的接受，并严肃的进行了深刻地检查。我们正在研究汽车肇祸原因及处理经过时，又看到人民日报七月二十一日第二版所载人民监察院对我们的批评，此时我们即暂时放下其他工作，专门澈查事件的责任及处理经过中的缺点。当七月三十一日接到监察院的通告后，又召开了内部扩干会，进一步分析了事件发生的责任。现将我们整理的材料报导如下：
    一、肇祸情况及处理结果：
    （一）四月二十四日早六时（报上说是七时），公司汽车发往临清，走到春厂村西，将邯郸县政府通讯员史庆云同志轧死。事件发生后，该车司机张志福乃将死者尸体移往路旁，并用席掩盖。当场由死者尸体上检出信件数封，乃将车驶回公司报告，公司于信件上测知死者系邯郸县政府之工作人员，乃一面派人协同汽车司机助手学徒将原车客人开至邯郸市政府，向当地政府机关自行投案；一面派干部到邯郸县政府报告真象，并专派人到出事地点看守尸体。市府于得知情况后，乃向车上乘客四人详询汽车肇事时之情况，并令该四人各在谈话记录上签名盖章，当将司机张志福扣押。公司会同专、市、县各级政府，于出事地点详加研究，公司立即购妥衣棺将死者入殓，并觅车送往死者家乡永年葛贾村，还出了埋葬费小米四百斤，在出殡那天，公司派专人到葛贾村向死者家属致慰问之意。公司计费用款折小米一千斤上下，司机被政府判处四年徒刑。
    （二）五月十三日十六号汽车司机刘阴太与沧县马车夫口角后，从公司邀集二十余工人到常庄附近将马车夫毒打一顿。事情发生以后，公司才知道了，原因是我们公司各负责同志正在开行政会议。因此事涉及政府治安，当将工人传唤审讯。结果将刘阴太扣押，公司经理亲向沧县马车工人道歉致慰，并赔偿牲口伤药费冀钞十万元，司机被政府判处拘役二个月。
    （三）五月二十日汽车行经永年东二十里左右，撞到一马车上，汽车水箱撞坏。当时汽车行驶并不快，因此乃向马车工人说理，令其赔偿损失。但马车工人蛮不讲理。恰好车乘客上有兽医队同志廿一人，因见马车工人不讲理，引起公愤，乃群起与之讲理。马车工人因理短，情愿坐车到公司述明情况，负责将水箱修好，并负责由永年城东到邯之乘车费。该车后碰着一头耕牛，未向农民赔偿道歉即行驶去。行至来马台村西，与农民杨春荣一头骡子相遇，杨春荣牵骡子躲到汽车路北边，因骡子怕汽车乱跳，杨某失去自主，碰到汽车前右边垫板上，汽车将人带倒，被后轮从屁股和脊背上压过，将肋骨轧坏，将头轧碎（邯郸县政府判决书语）。此事发生后，司机乃到附近邯郸县政府投案自首，另一方面向公司报告。公司乃派干部驶车开往肇事地点，会同政府研究情况，遵政府令与死者购衣棺抬埋，共出埋葬小米六百斤，司机李锡珍被政府判徒刑半年。
    二、我们自己对事件的处理和检讨：
    （１）张志福事件发生后，汽车部管理上认为：撇开客观原因，轧死人，确是个严重的问题，当即将此事件向工人进行教育，说明事情的严重性。说明司机张志福行车不够注意，出了事，不应该移动尸体。当时工人们情绪波动都不敢再开车。要求当修理工；领导上即首先安定工人情绪，传达上级颁发之汽车肇祸责任，一面教育工人以后开车提高注意，行至人稠之处，慢驶，鸣喇叭，倘依然难行驶时，即行停车。只要不肇祸，一天走不到，两天走，这样工人情绪，方慢慢安定下来。对司机张志福的处理，则听候政府判决。
    （２）刘阴太集众打人问题发生后，我们首先认为集体打人。比之张之事件还要严重。当即召集全体工人开会。当时工人中邪气太盛，追问打人者时，全都承认了参加打人，领导上首先打破坏集团，深入了解真象，把参加打人者找出。继而进行分组讨论，分清责任，展开自我检讨。领导上即行汇集材料，在工人中，采用上课方式，进行教育。政府对刘阴太处理比较严重，工人提出保证，决不再犯类似事情，否则愿受处分。因此没有处分工人群众，两个参加打人的党员，受到处分（内一人停止工作，作书面反省）。直到刘阴太从政府释放后，领导上作了打人问题的总结，二次召集工人大会，进行了当众警告，再度强调反对无组织、无纪律、无领导、无政府的作风。
    （３）李锡珍的事件发生后，在工人中引起了严重的注意，领导上再次指出：连出三事，证明工人们太不注意，群众观念太马糊，使得工人在思想上警惕起来。并规定了车的载重量，大车槽三十五人，小车槽三十人。行车中对面有人时，一定减低速度，遇对方躲开能过去，即行慢慢开过去，若对方不躲，我们一定停车。继而分析事件，是否可以避免，大家认为倘警惕性高，看见牲口怕车即将车停住，是可以避免的。对李锡珍处理则听候政府意见。
    以上连续不断发生的事件，我们认为是直接违反政府法令与对群众关系的，证明我们教育进行的非常不够。我们没有或很少加强工人的群众观念教育，没有使他们认识，人民的运输事业要没有广大群众的热烈帮助，是不会搞好的。今后加强工人的教育，加强他们的群众观点，是今后汽车工人工作的努力方向。这也是今后整个公司自上而下的在思想上工作中应该经常重视的问题，我们只有加倍努力来弥补过去的损失，改进我们的工作，来答复党报对我们的希冀。尚望更能提供更好更多的宝贵意见来帮助我们。
    致以敬礼

      八月四日
    编者按：本报暨冀南日报连续登载了邯郸运输公司汽车肇祸的消息，和读者对这些事情的批评与建议，已引起邯郸运输公司的注意，并根据党报和人民监察院的意见进行了初步检查。以严肃的态度对待和处理这一问题，这是好的。如果能从领导上再作检查，则对于从根本上解决问题会有更大帮助。我们要求读者将各地工作中存在的各种问题都能负责地提供给党报，开展批评和自我批评。
