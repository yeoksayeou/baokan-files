Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 5th - The CCP Central China Bureau recently issued a decision on launching a streamlining and thrift campaign to overcome financial difficulties. The decision pointed out that under the current situation of victorious development in the revolutionary struggle, although our work possesses many favorable conditions, it has also encountered many difficulties, the most significant of which is financial difficulty. The decision pointed out the reasons for the financial difficulties: the war is still ongoing, rural work in the vast Central China region has not yet been rolled out, and transportation has been destroyed by the enemy; the new liberated areas have been subjected to long-term exploitation by the Kuomintang and the rule of feudal forces, and the urban and rural economies are on the verge of bankruptcy; the taken-over Kuomintang bureaucratic institutions are bloated and huge, with enormous expenditures, and many public enterprises also generally have excessive staff and overlapping departments; the extravagance and waste of institutions entering the city has also increased considerably, coupled with this year's flood disasters, resulting in particularly severe financial difficulties. The decision proposed that, based on the current specific situation in Central China, the method for overcoming difficulties should mainly focus on reducing expenditure. The specific methods are: (1) Streamlining staffing. The principle of streamlining is to shrink the organs and enrich the lower levels, shrink the cities and enrich the countryside, shrink the rear and enrich the front lines, and shrink the service personnel and enrich the combat personnel. At the same time, we must promote the concept of diligence, strengthen work efficiency, and have one person do the work of two. (2) Save on expenses and tighten budgets. All unnecessary expenditures should be reduced, postponed, or not issued at all. Treatment standards should not be on par with those of the Northeast and North China. All office sundries should be re-examined and implemented on a contract basis to save money. In cities, the use of cars, gasoline, electricity, water, and housing should be strictly restricted; limiting banquets, advocating simplicity, and strictly prohibiting waste. When conditions permit, we can promote raising pigs, growing vegetables, reclaiming wasteland, and fishing as amateur labor production, and establish institutional cooperatives to improve institutional meals, but it is strictly forbidden to engage in speculation under the pretext of production. (3) Clean up and register the existing materials in each unit; those with excessive amounts will be uniformly adjusted by the logistics department. All gold and silver dollars stored in each unit shall be transferred to the bank in accordance with the method of discounted deposits. (4) In the taken-over enterprises and schools, it is necessary to change the Kuomintang's corrupt phenomenon of setting up positions based on individuals and unreasonable salaries, and strive for organizational rationalization; call on workers and staff to increase labor enthusiasm, save raw materials, and care for machines, in order to reduce costs and increase production.

In order to launch and implement this movement, the decision pointed out that it is necessary to immediately conduct ideological mobilization from top to bottom inside and outside the Party, so that all comrades can deeply understand that: streamlining and thrift is one of the Party's important current policies to defeat the enemy, overcome difficulties, and unite the masses; it is a concrete manifestation of prioritizing work in the countryside; it is an important concrete organizational work for taking over urban and rural areas, opening up new areas, carrying out bandit suppression and anti-hegemony in the vast countryside, and carrying out social reforms and industrial construction in the future; it is also an important measure to protect the Party's fine traditions, establish a hard-working and simple style, reorganize the Party's ranks, and transform the social customs of the new area. It is also necessary to make all comrades realize that the decadent tendencies of seeking enjoyment and being concerned about status, which are currently growing among cadres, will increase the difficulties of the revolution, disintegrate our ranks, and are extremely dangerous. Therefore, all leading cadres should have the determination and courage to implement streamlining and thrift, making drastic cuts and saving in every possible way; they must be willing to endure the pain, act swiftly and decisively; leaders must take responsibility and take action personally; they must lead by example and set an example for the public; they must make the streamlining and thrift campaign obtain mass support and become a mass movement; they must adhere to the implementation and not allow it to be abandoned halfway.

The decision pointed out that streamlining and thrift does not mean not using what should be used, but rather making the best use of people and things, so that people and things can be rationally used in the most necessary and important direction. Therefore, the focus of the movement should be on cities, especially leading organs. Front-line war expenses cannot be reduced, and production should be restored in a planned and step-by-step manner (but there should be a certain limit). The living standards of front-line soldiers and rear-area workers must be maintained and not lowered. New cadre training and technical personnel training savings plans should also be adhered to. The number of rural work cadres must be greatly increased, not reduced (but it should be distinguished from random recruitment and indiscriminate acceptance). When adjusting the structure and personnel of newly taken-over enterprises, it should be different from general administrative organs; it should not be a large-scale reduction, but should be partially, individually, and rationally adjusted under the condition that production is not hindered. Reactionaries and corrupt elements among the old staff of urban organs must be purged, and superfluous staff who receive salaries for doing nothing must be eliminated. The rest should be employed according to their talents. Those who are redundant should also be helped to find other jobs and engage in production, and should not be dealt with rashly.

The decision finally pointed out that streamlining and thrift will be a policy implemented by our Party for a considerable period of time. Not only when the war has not ended and the rural land reform has not been carried out, should streamlining and thrift be an important plan for financial management, even if the war ends and the land reform is completed in the future, although the standards of streamlining and thrift may have degree changes, because large-scale industrial construction must be carried out, it is still necessary to rely on saving methods to accumulate capital, and the streamlining and thrift policy must continue to be implemented. Therefore, the achievements obtained in this movement should be maintained and transformed into a regular and lasting system. The highest leading organs of the Party, government, and army in major cities should send the most responsible comrades to form a streamlining and thrift committee to implement the streamlining policy and make thrift a fixed and lasting style and system.

    中共中央华中局重要决定
    开展精简节约运动
    战胜敌人战胜困难
    号召全体干部深刻认识精简节约意义，下决心坚持贯彻下去。
    【新华社汉口五日电】中共中央华中局顷颁发关于开展精简节约运动，克服财政困难的决定。该决定指出：在当前革命斗争胜利发展的形势下，我们的工作虽具备许多有利条件，但也遇到了许多困难，其中最主要的是财政困难。决定指出发生财政困难的原因时说：战争还在进行，华中区广大农村工作尚未展开，交通被敌人破坏；新解放区经过国民党的长期压榨与封建势力统治，城乡经济濒于破产；被接管的国民党官僚机构臃肿庞大，开支浩繁，许多公营企业也普遍存在着冗员过多、机关重叠的现象，入城的机关铺张浪费现象也相当普遍地增长，加以今年水灾为患，致使财政困难特别严重。决定提出，根据目前华中的具体情况，克服困难的办法应以节流为主。具体的方法是：（一）精简编制。精简的原则是紧缩机关充实下层，紧缩城市充实乡村，紧缩后方充实前线，紧缩勤杂人员充实战斗人员。同时要提倡勤劳观念，加强工作效率，一个人做两个人的工作。（二）节省开支，紧缩预算。所有不必要支出一律削减、缓发或不发。待遇标准不应与东北、华北看齐。一切办公杂支应重新审核，实行包干制，以资节省。城市中应严格限制汽车、汽油、水电、住房等使用；限制请客，提倡朴素，严禁浪费。在条件允许时，可提倡喂猪、种菜、垦荒、打鱼等业余劳动生产，并开办机关合作社以改善机关伙食，但严禁藉口生产进行投机。（三）清理登记各单位现存物资；过多者由后勤部统一调剂。各单位所存黄金银元，一律照折实存款办法移交银行。（四）在接管的企业与学校中，要改变国民党因人设事及薪资不合理的腐败现象，力求组织合理化；号召工人、职员提高劳动热情，节省原料，爱护机器，达到减低成本、增加生产的目的。
    为开展与贯彻这一运动，决定指出：必须立即在党内外从上到下进行思想动员，使全体同志能深刻认识：精简节约是党当前战胜敌人、克服困难、团结群众的重要政策之一，是先将工作重心放在乡村的具体表现，是现在接管城乡、开辟新区、在广大乡村进行剿匪反霸及将来进行社会改革、工业建设的重要的具体组织工作之一；又是保护党的优良传统、树立艰苦朴素作风、整编党的队伍以及改造新区社会风尚的一个重要措施。还必须使全体同志认识：目前干部中正在滋长着的贪图享受、计较地位的蜕化倾向，将增加革命的困难，涣散自己的队伍，是极其危险的。因之，一切领导干部对于实行精简节约应有决心，有勇气，大刀阔斧，大减特减，大节特节；要不惜百痛，要雷厉风行；要首长负责，亲自动手；要以身作则，例范示众；要使精简节约运动取得群众支持成为群众运动；要坚持贯彻下去，不容半途而废。
    决定指出：精简节约并不是该用不用，而是要人得其所，物尽其用，使人与物都能合理使用于最必须最主要的方向。因此运动重点应放在城市，尤其是领导机关。前方战费不容削减，生产应有计划有步骤地恢复（但应有一定限度）。前线战士与后方职工生活水准必须保持，勿使降低。新干部训练和技术人员培养储蓄计划还应坚持。乡村工作干部必须大大增加而不是减少（但应与乱招、滥收区别开来）。新接管的企业在调整机构与人员时，应与一般行政机构有所区别，不是大裁大减，而应在不妨碍生产的条件下加以局部地个别地合理调整。对城市机关旧职员中的反动分子和贪污分子必须清洗，吃空薪的冗员必须淘汰，其余则应量才录用。多余者亦应帮助其另谋工作出路，从事生产，而不宜草率处理。
    决定最后指出：精简节约将是我党相当长期内执行的一个政策。不仅当战争未结束，乡村土地改革未进行，精简节约应为理财的重要方案，即使将来战争结束、土改完成后，精简节约的标准虽可能有程度上的变化，但由于要大规模地进行工业建设，仍须依赖节约方法积累资本，精简节约政策也就仍须继续执行。为此，对于此次运动所获得的成绩应该设法保持下来，进而转成经常持久的制度。各大城市党政军最高领导机关应派出最负责的同志，组成精简节约委员会，贯彻执行精简政策，并使节约成为一个固定的持久的作风与制度。
