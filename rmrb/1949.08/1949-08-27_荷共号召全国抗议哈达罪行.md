　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 26th: TASS, The Hague, August 25th: Newspapers published a resolution of the Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party, which expressed anger at the brutal acts of the Hatta group in killing Indonesian Communist Party Politburo member, Shariffudin, and others. The resolution emphasized that the Hatta group is attacking the Indonesian people, the Democratic Front and its leaders, and is serving Dutch and American imperialism. News from Indonesia proves that the guerrilla war is further developing, which demonstrates the Indonesian people's hatred for the Hatta group. The Indonesian people are continuing to fight for the complete independence of their country. The Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party warned against the illusion that the so-called "Round Table" conference has created conditions for stopping the bloodshed in Indonesia. The resolution pointed out that bloodshed will not be stopped by negotiating with people who cannot represent the Indonesian people, but only when the Dutch people and the true representatives of Indonesia reach an agreement. The Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party called on the Dutch working people and all progressive organizations to protest the killing of Indonesian Democratic Front leaders, and to protest the war and acts of terror being carried out in Indonesia. The Central Committee demanded the release of Indonesian patriots from prisons and concentration camps, and the creation of the necessary conditions for the Indonesian Democratic Front and trade unions to resume their activities.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 26th: TASS, The Hague: The Dutch people are angered by the Hatta group's actions in killing Indonesian people's leaders. Under the direction of foreign imperialism, the Hatta group is using terrorist acts to deal with Indonesian democratic organizations. The National Youth Federation of the Netherlands issued a protest to Hatta, who is now in The Hague, expressing strong anger at the atrocities of killing Indonesian Communist Party Politburo member, Shariffudin, Suripno, and other prominent Indonesian democratic leaders.
