　　The United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee's East China Bureau invited people from all walks of life and various democratic parties in Shanghai to a discussion on the American White Paper on the 27th. Over fifty people attended, including Wu Youxun, Mao Yisheng, Chen Wangdao, Wang Zaoshi, and Zhang Bo. At the meeting, Jin Zhonghua said: "In the past two or three years, Stuart Leighton has mainly attempted to instigate a so-called 'democratic individualism' movement. The 'liberalism,' 'New May Fourth Movement,' 'Third Road,' etc., that frequently appeared in magazines in the past were all part of this movement. They wanted to rule China by methods similar to those used to support social democratic parties in Europe, but this will not lead to any result." Feng Binfu said: "We see from the White Paper that the US government has concerns, mainly about the Soviet Union. This further proves that the victory of the Chinese people's revolution would not have been possible without international assistance. Tito's betrayal of socialism resulted in him falling into the arms of imperialism. His slander and defamation of the Soviet Union is actually a task given to him by the imperialists. Tito has completely become a tool of imperialism." Wang Yunsheng said: "The publication of the White Paper is beneficial to us. The Third Road that American imperialism instigated in the past has completely failed. Now it wants to support the so-called 'democratic individualists' in China to make trouble against the great power of the people. I don't believe it can achieve anything." Ou Tianhuai said: "American imperialism sent special envoys to China advocating that the Northeast be handed over to the United Nations for trusteeship. We didn't believe it in the past, but now American imperialism has confessed it itself." Wu Youxun and Mao Yisheng believed that the White Paper is very unscientific, and its content is full of contradictions, exposing the US government's hesitation and feelings of failure. Zhang Bo said: "When capitalism develops to the stage of imperialism, it inevitably brings about fatal economic crises. Now, Wall Street politicians like Truman are trying to save their economic crises by using tricks such as aiding the reactionary Kuomintang, the Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty, and the Western European Union." Chen Wangdao said: "American imperialism has always been pursuing a gap-drilling policy. The White Paper was published at a time when the Chinese liberation war has achieved a basic victory, and its intention is to drill a gap: fantasizing that the old intellectuals, influenced by the old democracy, cannot understand the new democracy for a while, so it takes the opportunity to drill this gap." Liu Kaiqu said: "We can loudly tell the American imperialists that the 'Chinese democratic individualists' whom they fantasize can be their slaves are unable to find any strong foundation among today's Chinese intellectuals or other circles." Pan Hannian hoped that everyone would do more propaganda work to expose the conspiracies of American imperialism, pay attention to striving for the self-awakening of these "democratic individualists," unite together, and be vigilant against the vicious and insidious tricks of American imperialism.

　　上海各界座谈白皮书
  　揭露美帝阴谋诡计
    【新华社上海二十九日电】中共中央华东局统一战线工作部于二十七日邀请沪市各界及各民主党派人士座谈美国白皮书问题。到吴有训、茅以升、陈望道、王造时、张＠伯等五十余人。会上金仲华说：司徒雷登近二三年，主要就是企图策动所谓“民主个人主义”运动，过去杂志上常出现的“自由主义”、“新五四运动”、“第三条路线”等等，就是这种运动。他们想用类似在欧洲扶植社会民主党的办法来统治中国，这是不会有任何结果的。冯宾符说：我们从白皮书里看到美国政府是有所顾忌的，其所顾忌的主要是苏联。由此更可证明，中国人民革命的胜利如无国际的援助是不可能的。铁托叛变社会主义，结果便倒在帝国主义的怀抱里，他对苏联的诽谤诬蔑，实际上是帝国主义者交给他的任务。铁托已经完全变成帝国主义的工具了。王芸生说：白皮书的发表是对我们有益的，美帝国主义过去所策动的第三条路线已经完全失败了，如今又想扶助中国的所谓“民主个人主义者”，与伟大的人民力量捣乱，我不相信它能得到什么结果。欧天怀说：美帝国主义派遣特使来华主张把东北交给联合国托管，以往我们听了不相信，现在美帝国主义自己招供了。吴有训、茅以升认为：白皮书是非常不科学的，内容充满了矛盾暴露了美国政府的彷徨和失败情绪。张＠伯说：资本主义发展到帝国主义阶级，就无可避免地带来致命的经济危机，现在华尔街政客杜鲁门之流，就是想用援助反动的国民党及马歇尔计划，北大西洋公约，西欧联盟等花样来挽救他们的经济危机。陈望道说：美帝国主义一直在推行钻缝政策，白皮书发表于中国解放战争取得基本胜利之时，其用意也就是钻缝：幻想旧的知识分子受旧民主主义的薰陶，对新民主主义一时不能领略，趁机来钻一下这个空子。刘开渠说：我们可以大声地告诉美帝国主义者：他所幻想的可以做他牛马的“中国民主个人主义者”，在今日的中国知识分子中或其他各界中是找不到什么强大的基础的。潘汉年希大家多做揭露美帝国主义阴谋的宣传工作，注意争取教育这些“民主个人主义者”自我觉醒，一致团结，警戒美帝国主义的恶毒阴险的诡计。
