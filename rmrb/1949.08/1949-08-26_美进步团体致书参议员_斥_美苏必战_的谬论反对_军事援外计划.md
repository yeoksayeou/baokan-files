Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 22nd: The Standing Committee of the American organization "Striving for Peaceful Alternatives to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Conference," representing the broad masses of the American people, has published a letter to all US Senators, urging them to defeat Truman's "Military Foreign Aid Plan." The letter was signed by eight hundred and forty-seven prominent scientists, cultural figures, and religious leaders from forty-five states. The letter points out: The vast majority of the American people reject the illusory argument that a US-Soviet war is inevitable. "We, American citizens concerned about the well-being of the United States and world peace, urge you to reject the proposal to arm Western Europe and other countries." The letter continues, it is unimaginable to spend this money on armaments when the cost of the Cold War is already heavily draining the income of American civilians, and when the world is in dire need of economic recovery while Western European countries are anxiously trying to prevent economic disaster.

    斥“美苏必战”的谬论反对“军事援外计划”
    【新华社北平二十五日电】塔斯社纽约二十二日讯，美国“争取以和平办法代替北大西洋公约会议”的常设委员会，顷代表美国广大人民，发表致美国全体参议员的一封信，力促他们击败杜鲁门的“军事援外计划”。该信签字者有四十五州中的著名科学家、文化人和宗教家八百四十七名。该信指出：绝大多数美国人民都拒绝虚妄的美苏战争不可避免的论调。“我们，关怀美国幸福与世界和平的美国公民，敦请你们否决武装西欧及其他国家武器的建议。”该信继称，当冷战的费用正大量剥夺美国平民的收入，当全世界急需经济恢复而西欧各国正在焦虑如何阻止经济灾难的时候，却把这笔款子花费在军备上，这真是不可想象的事情。
