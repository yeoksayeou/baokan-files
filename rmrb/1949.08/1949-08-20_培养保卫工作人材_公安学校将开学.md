　　Cultivating Security Personnel
  　Public Security School to Open
    [Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Public Security Bureau's Public Security School is now ready and will open in the coming days. The students are Party members, Youth League members, and progressive students from various schools. They are willing to participate in the people's public security construction work. However, they still lack a general understanding of public security work, and they are not clear about the position of the public security departments in the national structure and their role. After propaganda and mobilization explanations in various schools, they initially understood that today's Public Security Bureau is essentially different from the enemy's police station. The former is revolutionary and glorious, and an important part of the national institution that protects the interests of the people; while the latter is a tool for counter-revolutionary thugs, a reactionary institution that suppresses the people. At the same time, the people's security work is not a purely technical work, but mainly a work that relies on the broad masses. After a few studies at the school, the students have felt the importance and arduousness of the security work. After the students visited the Anti-Espionage and Public Security Exhibition held by the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, they became more interested in learning. Before the school started, the students took the initiative to transform the environment, build ball fields, clean up the house, carry soil, etc., and compile songs and dance programs to prepare for the opening.

　　培养保卫工作人材
  　公安学校将开学
    【本报讯】市公安局公安学校，现已筹备就绪，将于日内开学。入学学员是来自各学校的党员团员和进步学生。他们愿意参加人民的公安建设工作。但对于公安工作还缺乏一般的了解，对公安部门在国家机构中的地位及其作用均不清楚。经过在各校的宣传动员解释，才初步了解到：今天的公安局与敌人的警察局本质上不同，前者是革命的光荣的，是保卫人民利益的国家机构中的重要组成部分；而后者则是反革命的爪牙工具，镇压人民的反动机构。同时人民的保卫工作，不是单纯的技术工作，主要是依靠广大的群众来进行的工作。学生到校后，经过几次学习，已感到保卫工作的重要，任务艰巨。此次北平市公安局举办的反特治安展览会，学员们参观后，更增加了学习兴趣。在未开学前，学员们自己动手来改造环境，建立球场，收拾屋子，抬土等，并编练歌、舞节目，准备迎接开学。
