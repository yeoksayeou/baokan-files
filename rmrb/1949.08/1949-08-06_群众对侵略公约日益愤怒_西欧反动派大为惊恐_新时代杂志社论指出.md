Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th: Moscow dispatch: An editorial in the New Era magazine, published on August 3rd, states: The backdrop to the debate in Western European parliaments regarding the North Atlantic Treaty is the growing anger of the masses towards this treaty. In Italy, petitions protesting the North Atlantic Treaty collected over seven million signatures in a short period. In the French National Assembly, petitions with hundreds of thousands of signatures were piled high on Foreign Minister Schuman's desk. In all the participating countries of the treaty, mass rallies and demonstrations have been held everywhere, demanding that their governments withdraw from the treaty. Many factories held protest strikes.

This people's movement cannot but affect the parliamentary debates on the North Atlantic Treaty. The voices of patriotic individuals who cherish their national sovereignty are a stark warning. Their speeches exposed the aggressive nature of the treaty, causing deep alarm within the reactionary camp. These reactionaries are now betraying the interests of their nations.

That the treaty will be ratified by the parliaments of Western European countries is a foregone conclusion. However, this action by the reactionary politicians exposes them more than ever before.

In the American Congress, the treaty met with much greater opposition than its creators had anticipated. Quite a few senators came forward to oppose the treaty. Aware that elections are due in 1950, they are clearly unwilling to unconditionally link their own fate with the aggressive policies of the rulers in Washington.

The looming economic crisis, rising cost of living, and rapidly increasing unemployment have exacerbated domestic discontent. Many members of Congress are greatly shocked by this ever-increasing dissatisfaction. The members of Congress will naturally not be persuaded by stale anti-Soviet fabrications, or by platitudes saying the bill "stipulates America's defense and general welfare," or by solemn assurances that the North Atlantic Treaty and military aid program contained in the bill are in accordance with the United Nations Charter. The old goods widely promoted in Truman's messages and State Department pamphlets clearly find no customers. Every new step they take makes it harder to conceal one thing, which is that this is actually implementing a new aggression plan.

The initiators of the treaty seek to pass military measures related to the treaty. At the same time, within the ruling groups -- not only in the United States, but also in Western Europe -- opposition to this aggression pact is growing. The London Times said that there is on both sides of the Atlantic "a hesitant mood, expressed in 'solemn affairs' and criticisms of the purpose of the treaty, doubting its value or necessity."

Every day that passes, the aggressive nature of the North Atlantic Treaty and the military plans it contains becomes more and more prominent. Now, everyone knows that the treaty has brought its participating countries a frenzied arms race, huge military budgets, an unusual increase in armed forces, the establishment of an extensive network of naval and air military bases, and finally turning them into aggressive weapons of American imperialism.

Pulling Italy into the North Atlantic bloc clearly shows that the initiators of this reckless adventure are seriously violating their international commitments. The peace treaty with Italy, signed by the United States and Britain, prohibits Italy from participating in any alliance or other group pursuing aggressive aims. The purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty is precisely to prepare an attack on the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.

The imperialists are dizzy with militaristic fantasies, they greatly praise the ratification of the treaty and shout "victory"; but let them not be deceived by these empty achievements. The development of events shows that the position of the initiators of the North Atlantic Treaty is becoming more and more shaky, and the ground under their feet is collapsing. The people are waging a resolute struggle against the implementation of evil and reckless plans that have become a threat to their security and world peace.

### 群众对侵略公约日益愤怒  西欧反动派大为惊恐  新时代杂志社论指出

    群众对侵略公约日益愤怒
    西欧反动派大为惊恐
    新时代杂志社论指出
    【新华社北平五日电】莫斯科讯：八月三日出版的新时代杂志的社论写道：西欧各国国会关于北大西洋公约的辩论的背景，就是群众对这一公约的日益愤怒。在意大利，人民抗议北大西洋公约的请愿书，短时期内就征集了七百多万人的签名。在法国国民议会，有几十万人签名的请愿书，高堆在外长舒曼的桌上。在所有该公约的参加国中，各地纷纷举行群众大会及示威，要求他们的政府脱离该公约。许多工厂举行了抗议罢工。
    这一人民运动，不能不影响国会对北大西洋公约的辩论。珍爱自己国家主权的爱国志士的呼声，乃是严峻的警告。他们的演说揭露了公约的侵略性质，引起反动阵营内部的深刻惊恐。这些反动派现在正在出卖他们民族的利益。
    公约会得到西欧各国国会的批准，这是预先就确定了的事。但是，反动政客们的这一行动，却较已往任何时候更暴露了他们自己。
    在美国国会中，公约碰到了较公约创设者所预计的大得多的反对。不少参议员出面反对该公约。他们有鉴于一九五○年将有选举，显然不愿无保留地把他们自己的命运与现在华盛顿的统治者们的侵略政策连结在一起。
    降临中的经济危机、上升中的生活费用，迅速增加的失业，加剧了国内的不满。许多国会议员对这一不断增涨的不满大为震惊。议员们自然不会被陈腐的反苏捏造、或是说法案“规定美国的防务和普遍福利”的那种谰言、或是说法案所包含的北大西洋公约及军事援助计划符合联合国宪章的这种庄严保证所说服。杜鲁门的咨文及国务院小册子中所广事宣传的陈货，显然找不到主顾。他们每采一项新步骤，都使得更难于掩盖一件事，即实际上这是执行新侵略计划。
    公约的创导人们力求通过与公约相关的军事措施。同时，在统治集团中间——不只是美国，西欧亦是如此——对这一侵略公约的反对则正在增涨。伦敦泰晤士报说，大西洋两岸有着“一种迟疑不定的情绪，表现于‘郑重将事’和对公约之目的的批评，怀疑它的价值或必要性”。
    日子每过去一天，北大西洋公约及其所包含的军事计划的侵略性质，就愈益显得突出。现在，任何人都知道，公约给其参加国带来了疯狂的军备竞争、庞大的军事预算、武装部队的不平常的增加、广泛的海空军事基地网的建立以及最后把它们变成美帝国主义的侵略武器。
    把意大利拉入北大西洋集团，显然地表明，这一鲁莽冒险的创导者们正严重地违反他们的国际约言。对意和约有美国及英国签字，它禁止意大利参加任何追求侵略目的的同盟或其他集团。而北大西洋公约之拟定，其目的恰恰是在准备进攻苏联及人民民主国家。
    帝国主义者为军国主义的幻想搅昏了头脑，他们大事称颂批准公约，并且叫唤“胜利”；但是，让他们不要被这些空幻的成就所欺。事情的发展表明：北大西洋公约创导者的地位正越来越动摇，他们脚下的地在下坠中。人民正在进行坚决的斗争，反对执行罪恶鲁莽的计划，这种计划已成为对他们安全与世界和平的威胁。
