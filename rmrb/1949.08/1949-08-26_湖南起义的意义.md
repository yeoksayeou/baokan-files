　　The Significance of the Hunan Uprising

　　General Cheng Qian and General Chen Mingren issued two successive circular telegrams on the 1st, 4th, and 5th of this month, along with an Open Letter to the People of Hunan and an Open Letter to the Soldiers of Hunan, which have been published by this agency. The uprising of General Cheng Qian and General Chen Mingren and their related documents are not only welcomed by the people of Hunan and the whole country, but are also bound to cause a significant reaction within the remaining Kuomintang forces.

　　The uprising of Generals Cheng and Chen once again proves that within the remaining Kuomintang ranks, there are many patriotic military and political personnel who are waiting and seeking opportunities to break away from the counter-revolutionary group and join the people's side.

　　The more the counter-revolutionary group finds itself in dire straits, the more it engages in perverse acts. Therefore, more of its military and political personnel are discerning right from wrong, determined to atone for their mistakes by performing meritorious deeds. In the eight months of this year alone, taking the largest incidents as examples, there was General Fu Zuoyi's peaceful resolution of the Beijing issue in January; Captain Deng Zhaoxiang leading the cruiser Chongqing in an uprising in February; the entire delegation of the Kuomintang government's peace talks representatives, Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, Huang Shaohong, Zhang Shizhao, Liu Fei, Li Zheng, and their entourages, accepting the reasonable and fair domestic peace agreement proposed by the Chinese Communist Party in April (only not signed due to the opposition of the bandit chiefs such as Jiang, Li, and Bai); in the same month, General Lin Zun led 25 warships of the Kuomintang Navy's Third Fleet in an uprising on the Nanjing riverfront; Regiment Commander Liu Nongxuan led the Kuomintang Parachute Regiment's Third Regiment in an uprising at sea; in May, General Zhang Zhen led four divisions in an uprising on the Hankou front; and General Wu Qihwei and others launched the uprising on the Fujian-Guangdong border. In addition, there were many people within the Kuomintang who called for the acceptance of the CCP's peace terms, expressing their views and taking action. This situation has caused great panic among the Jiang Jieshi, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and Yan Xishan bandit gangs. Before the uprising of Generals Cheng Qian and Chen Mingren, the Jiang Jieshi bandit gang tried various methods to sabotage it, but Generals Cheng and Chen still successfully implemented their original plan, and the provincial capital of Changsha and its surrounding counties were peacefully liberated. Moreover, the majority of Kuomintang military and political personnel under Cheng and Chen's command were able to accept the propositions of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership of Generals Cheng and Chen, striving to transform themselves and serve the people. The Hunan uprising severely shook the Kuomintang remnants in South China, Southeast China, Southwest China, and Northwest China. The Hunan uprising tells them that resistance to the People's Liberation Army is futile, and the only bright future is to break away from the Jiang, Li, and Bai bandit gangs and accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Anyone who truly achieves this step has the hope of being understood by the people.

　　Generals Cheng Qian and Chen Mingren are now working closely with the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army, which is advancing south, and the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, beginning to transform the troops and government agencies under their command, and beginning to build and gradually consolidate the democratic order in Hunan. We wish Generals Cheng and Chen success in their efforts, and we wish the new Hunan a successful birth and development!

### 湖南起义的意义

　　湖南起义的意义
    程潜将军及陈明仁将军在本月一日、四日、五日连续发出通电两件，告湖南民众书、告湖南将士书各一件，已由本社先后发表。程潜将军及陈明仁将军等人的起义和他们的这些文电，不但为湖南和全国的人民所欢迎，而且不能不在国民党残余力量中引起重大的反响。
    程陈两将军的起义，又一次证明了残存的国民党营垒中，有不少有爱国心的军政人员，正在等待和寻找脱离反革命集团而投入人民方面的机会。
    反革命集团愈是山穷水尽，就愈加要倒行逆施，因此它的军政人员中判明了利害是非，决心立功自赎的事情就愈加多起来。在今年的八个月中，只拿最大的几件来说，就有一月间傅作义将军和平解决北平问题，二月间邓兆祥舰长率领巡洋舰重庆号起义，四月间国民党政府和平代表团全体代表张治中、邵力子、黄绍＠、章士钊、刘斐、李蒸，及其随员们接受中国共产党所提的合理的公平的国内和平协定（仅因蒋李白等匪首反对而没有签字），同月林遵将军率领国民党海军第三舰队舰艇二十五艘在南京江面起义，刘农＠团长率领国民党伞兵第三团在海上起义，五月间张轸将军率领四个师在汉口前线起义，吴奇伟将军等发动了闽粤边的起义。此外，国民党内要求接受中共和平条件，发为言论和行动的人们还有很多。这种情况，已使蒋介石李宗仁白崇禧阎锡山匪帮感到极大的恐慌。这次程潜陈明仁两将军起义前，蒋介石匪帮曾经想种种方法来破坏，但是程陈两将军仍然胜利的实现了原定计划，长沙省会及其附近各县得以和平解放，而湖南程陈属下的多数国民党军政人员，也能在程陈两将军领导之下，接受中国共产党和中国人民解放军的主张，为改造自己、服务人民而努力。湖南的起义，严重地震撼了华南、东南、西南、西北的国民党残部。湖南的起义告诉他们，对于人民解放军的抵抗是没有前途的，唯一的光明前途，就是脱离蒋李白匪帮，接受中国共产党的领导，而无论什么人，只要真正做到这一步，就有受到人民谅解的希望。
    程潜陈明仁两将军现在正在与长驱南下的中国人民解放军第四野战军和中国共产党湖南省委员会密切合作，开始着手改造所属的军队和政府机构，开始建设和逐步巩固湖南的民主秩序。祝程陈两将军努力的成功，祝新湖南的诞生和发展！
