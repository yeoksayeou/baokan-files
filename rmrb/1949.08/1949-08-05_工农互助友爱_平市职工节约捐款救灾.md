    Worker-Peasant Mutual Aid and Friendship
    Tianjin Workers Conserve and Donate Funds for Disaster Relief
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Recently, continuous heavy rain in parts of North China has caused rivers to swell, leading to floods in areas of central Hebei Province, including Ji. Workers in factories and government offices in Beijing have launched a campaign to conserve resources and donate funds for disaster relief. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year War of Liberation, our working class-led revolution relied mainly on the support of the broad masses of peasants. Now that North China has been completely liberated and the working class has been emancipated and achieved victory, the peasants are suffering from floods. Workers are actively donating funds to help the peasants, which is a concrete manifestation of the friendship and mutual assistance between the working class and the peasant class. As of now, the following donations have been received from workers in factories and government offices: 18,528 yuan (People's Currency) from the Beijing No. 4 Ordnance Repair Factory; 10,000 yuan from the Guangming Daily Printing Plant. In addition, workers at the Hotel de Peking responded to the government's call and launched a conservation campaign. Starting from July 25th, workers pledged to abstain from smoking and reduce the use of consumables. The 137 workers collectively saved 55,900 yuan to help disaster victims. Staff at the Temple of Heaven Anti-Epidemic Experimental Station also donated 15 catties of millet, four bars of soap, and 38,150 yuan to help disaster victims. All the donated millet, soap, and money have been handed over to the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the North China People's Government for transfer to the disaster victims in Hebei Province and other areas. Such disaster relief through donations and mutual assistance is worthy of everyone's emulation.

    【本报讯】近来华北部分地区霪雨连绵，河水猛涨，河北省冀中等地区发生水灾，北平市工厂机关工人纷纷展开节约捐款救灾运动。在八年的抗日战争及三年的解放战争中，我们工人阶级领导的革命，主要是依靠广大农民的支援，目前华北已经全部解放了，工人阶级翻身了，胜利了；现在农民遭受了水灾，工人们纷纷捐款救助农民，这是工人阶级和农民阶级友爱互助的具体表现。到目前为止，已收到工厂机关工人捐款数目计有：北平第四修械所人民券一万八千五百二十八元。光明日报印刷厂一万元。此外，六国饭店工友响应政府号召，展开节约运动，自七月二十五日起，工友们保证今后不吸烟、节用消耗品，全体工友一百三十七人，把节省下来的五万五千九百元，救助灾民。天坛防疫实验处职工亦捐了小米十五斤，肥皂四条，款三万八千一百五十元救助灾民。以上所捐的小米、肥皂和钱款均已交到华北人民政府民政部转送给河北省等地的灾民。这种捐款救灾，友爱互助，是值得大家学习的。
