    Fire Line Admission to the Party
    Zhixia
    When my Zhou Liao Column crossed the Grand Canal and went straight to Cao Baj, Duan Su Regiment of the unit cooperated with brother units to carry out a resolute annihilation war against Chiang Kai-shek's "Honor Second Division" with equal enemy and our forces, Comrade Wang Shigang, the machine gun shooter of the third company of the regiment, wrote a letter to the Party branch after the battle mobilization; the handwriting was crooked, but it revealed a kind of ardent feeling for the Party. The letter read:
    "Comrades of the branch committee: I am willing to join the Communist Party of China. In this battle, no matter what task the Party and superiors give me, I will resolutely complete it... Please help me more so that I can progress quickly..."
    The branch committee discussed his letter, based on his performance since the Jinan Campaign: brave in combat, helping new comrades during marches, and his determination to ask for tasks in this battle, and quickly replied to his letter:
    "Your spirit is worthy of our welcome; and we are willing to actively help you and call on the whole company to learn from you..."
    The two letters spread quickly throughout the company, causing a wave in the hearts of every officer and soldier—making Party members feel how they should fight; non-Party members awakened to how they should prepare to fight.
    The annihilation war was glorious and brilliant, but it was also tense and arduous. Cao Baj was surrounded by water on all sides, the water being forty to fifty meters wide. Due to the urgent task of our army, the equipment was not prepared in time, so we could only break through through a dilapidated wooden bridge in the north gate. When the warriors rushed onto the wooden bridge and attacked from the north gate, the enemy concentrated its forces and artillery to repeatedly fight for the breakthrough point with us, and the front and back of the wooden bridge became a sea of ​​fire. At the beginning, Comrade Wang Shigang used a machine gun to cover the blasting and assault teams to cross the bridge; later, when the entire company continued to advance, he carried the machine gun and rushed to the front, sweeping and rushing to the bridgehead. At this time, a shrapnel pierced his left arm, and blood soaked his cotton coat. After pulling it out with force, he bravely rushed forward again. In order to avoid the enemy's frontal shooting from the north gate, the team rushed to the left front from the side of the gate. Wang Shigang, wounded, stubbornly blocked the north gate with this breakthrough point where the artillery fire was the fiercest, and swept at the enemy, enabling the troops to quickly develop into the depths and occupy the area to the left of the street inside the north gate. But just then, a shell exploded beside him, and Comrade Wang Shigang was seriously injured and fell down again. Then the enemy threw incendiary bombs, and he was about to be burned. A soldier ran up and helped him into the house on the left that we had occupied.
    The enemy blocked the breakthrough. Because the follow-up troops could not come up immediately and the ammunition could not be delivered on time, the warriors stubbornly held on to the few houses they had obtained, resisting countless counterattacks from all directions. Obviously, the enemy attempted to desperately pull out this knife inserted into the heart before our follow-up troops came in. Failing to counterattack, the enemy concentrated the entire division's artillery fire on one point, trying to flatten the houses and eliminate the warriors of our battalion in these few broken houses. The enemy's grenades and shells poured in like raindrops, the entire house flashed with the light of artillery fire and was filled with thick smoke, shrapnel whistled, and dust flew. Some houses caught fire, some corners collapsed, and the number of wounded gradually increased. But the warriors who were not injured or lightly injured still resisted the counterattacking enemy by the windows and corners of the houses, repelling the enemy again and again.
    Comrade Wang Shigang was lying quietly in the corner of the house that was shaken by the sound of guns and cannons. Some wounded nearby were moaning. He tried several times to struggle to get up and touch his machine gun, but he couldn't lift his body because his chest injury was very serious and blood was still flowing. The instructor, who was directing the battle everywhere, walked past him, discovered him, and when he kindly stroked him, he tightly held the instructor's hand and said with great sadness:
    "Instructor: I actively asked to join the Party before the war, but now I am injured before I could be tested by the Party, I am sorry..." His tearful eyes were staring at the instructor:
    "Comrade!" The instructor said earnestly: "You have completed the Party's task, we will consider your problem, you should rest here in peace first..."
    The instructor quickly ran to a window. Here, the machine gun shooter, Comrade Sun Shenjing, was trying his best to block the enemy. Comrade Sun Shenjing was the squad leader in the squad where Comrade Wang Shigang was.
    "How many Party members are there in your group?" The instructor asked concisely.
    "There are three more."
    "Go! Immediately gather them to discuss Comrade Wang Shigang's application to join the Party. I will block this window for you. The sooner the better!" The machine gun clicked in the instructor's hand.
    Within a few minutes, Comrade Sun Shenjing gathered the Party members in the group. Holding the hot guns they had just put down, feeling the blood stains on their bodies and the cotton clothes torn by shrapnel, their faces blackened by artillery fire, solemn, cautious, and responsible expressions floated on their faces. Everyone squatted beside Comrade Wang Shigang, briefly exchanged opinions, and voted. Comrade Sun Shenjing then concentrated the opinions, conveyed them to the instructor, and went back to fire his machine gun.
    The instructor quickly talked to the battalion commander and instructor. He came back and announced to all the officers and soldiers who were stubbornly resisting the enemy's counterattack in this extremely tense atmosphere of smoke, fire, explosions, and fighting, in an extremely solemn and loud tone:
    "Comrades: Comrade Wang Shigang applied to join the Party before the war, fought bravely in the battle, did not leave the firing line when he was slightly injured, and continued to fire the machine gun. After discussion by the Party group and the branch committee, he was approved to join the Party..."
    This was a call, like a new force, enhancing the combat will of every officer and soldier. The ammunition was running out, and everyone prepared stones and gun butts, and the moans of the wounded were gone.
    Comrade Wang Shigang was lying on the ground, and said humbly: "I am not good enough!" A grenade exploded beside him again, covering his face with soil, but it did not take away the amiable smile that was showing.
    The warriors who were fighting fiercely in the enemy's heart persisted from noon yesterday until noon the next day, for a full twelve hours. ... Suddenly, the sound of guns at the breakthrough point rang out loudly, and Battalion Commander Wang shouted:
    "Comrades: Our old brother regiment has rushed in, fix bayonets, and follow me to rush out."
    The warriors rushed out bravely, and in a very short time, they completely occupied Cao Baj and annihilated Chiang Kai-shek's "Honor Second Division".
    Wang Shigang was carried out of the house by stretcher bearers. He looked back at the houses in this area that had been riddled with holes by the enemy's artillery fire, some of which had collapsed and some were still burning. He also carefully looked at the piles of enemy corpses around the houses, and couldn't help but think of the heroic resistance on the enemy's artillery fire focus last night, as if he had plunged into the scene of that fierce battle again, and heard the instructor's solemn and loud announcement in the explosion and fighting: Approved him to join the Party. ...

    火线入党
    知侠
    当我周廖纵队强渡运河，直扑曹八集，该部段苏团配合兄弟部队，以敌我相等兵力对蒋匪“荣誉二师”进行坚决的歼灭战的时候，该团三连机枪射手王世岗同志在战斗动员后，给党的支部写了一封信；字迹歪歪扭扭，但却流露出一种对党赤热的心情。信上写道：
    “支部委员会的同志们：我甘心乐意参加中国共产党。在这次战斗中，党与上级无论给我什么任务，我都坚决完成，……请你们多多帮助我，使我很快进步……。”
    支委会讨论了他的信，根据他从济南战役以来的表现；作战勇敢，行军中帮助新同志，以及他在这次要求任务的决心，很快的复了他的信：
    “你这种精神，值得我们欢迎；并愿意积极帮助你，号召全连向你学习……。”
    两封信风快的在全连传阅，在每个指战员的内心里都引起一种波动——使党员同志感到自己应该怎样战斗；非党员同志觉醒到自己准备怎样战斗。
    歼灭战是光辉的、烂灿的，但同样也是紧张的、艰苦的。曹八集四面环水，水宽四五十米，由于我军任务紧急，器材没能来得及准备，因此只能通过北门一座残破的木桥，打开突破口。当勇士们冲上木桥，从北门打过去的时候，敌人集中兵力与炮火，与我反复争夺突破口，木桥前后四周，顿成一片火海。开始，王世岗同志用机枪，掩护爆破和突击队过桥；以后全连继续向前发展的时候，他端着机枪，冲在最前面，一边扫射着一边冲上桥头。这时一颗弹片，插进他的左臂，鲜血流湿了棉衣，他用力拔掉后，又勇猛的冲上前去。为了避开北门敌人正面的射击，队伍从门旁边向左前方冲杀过去。王世岗同志带着伤顽强地在这炮火最猛烈的突破口上，堵住北门，向敌扫射，使部队能迅速向纵深发展，占领了北门里街左边一带房屋。可是就在这时，一颗炮弹在他身边爆炸，王世岗同志又负了重伤倒下来。接着敌人投来燃烧弹，眼着就要烧着他了，一个战士跑上来，便把他扶进左边被我占领的房屋里去。
    敌人封锁了突破口。由于后续部队不能马上上来，弹药不能按时运到，勇士们顽强地坚守在已得的这几座屋子里，抗击着无数次的四面八方反扑的敌人。显然敌人企图在我后续部队没进来前，拼死力要拔去这插进心脏的刀子。反扑不逞，敌人便集中全师炮火在一点，想把房屋炸平，把我们一营的勇士消灭在这几间破屋子里。敌人的手榴弹，炮弹象雨点样泼进来，整个房子闪着炮火的光亮和弥漫着浓密的烟雾，弹片呼啸，尘土飞扬。有的房子着火了，有的屋角倒塌了，伤员也渐渐加多了。但是未负伤或负轻伤的勇士们凭着门窗、屋角，依然抗击着反扑的敌人，把敌人一次又一次的击溃下去。
    王世岗同志静静地躺在被枪炮声所震动的屋角里。附近有些伤员在呻吟着，他几次想挣扎起来，去摸他的机枪，却抬不起身来，因他胸部的伤很重，血还在流着。正在四处指挥作战的指导员走过他的身旁，发现了他，亲切的扶摸他时，他紧紧的拉着指导员的手，十分难过地说：
    “指导员：我战前积极要求入党，现在没能叫党来考验我，就负伤了，我对不起……”他含泪的眼睛在盯着指导员：
    “同志！”指导员恳切地说：“你已经完成了党的任务，你的问题我们考虑，你先在这里安心休息……”。
    指导员迅速地跑到一个窗口。这里机枪射手孙身镜同志正在拼全力阻击敌人。孙身镜同志是王世岗同志的所在班里的小组长。
    “你组还有几个党员？”指导员简捷的问。
    “还有三个。”
    “去！马上召集他们讨论一下王世岗同志的入党问题。我来替你堵这个窗口。越快越好！”机枪便在指导员手上咔咔的响起来了。
    几分钟内，孙身镜同志召集来组内的党员。他们握着刚歇下来的滚热的枪，摸着身上的血迹和弹片撕出了棉絮的棉衣，炮火熏黑的脸，浮上严肃、慎重、负责的神情。大家蹲在王世岗同志身旁，简短的交换了意见，付了表决，孙身镜同志然后把意见集中，转达给指导员，又去打他的机枪。
    指导员很快和营长、教导员谈了一下。回来便在这烟火、爆炸、厮杀——极度紧张的气氛里，以极庄严的响亮的音调，向正在顽强抗击敌人反扑的全体指战员们宣布：
    “同志们：王世岗同志战前要求入党，战斗中作战英勇，轻伤不下火线，继续打机枪，重伤后不叫苦，经过党的小组及支委会讨论，批准他入党……”
    这是一个号召，有如一股新的力量，增强了每个指战员的战斗意志。弹药要完了，大家都准备了石块和枪托，伤员们的呻吟也没有了。
    王世岗同志躺在地上，谦和地说：“我还不够！”一颗手榴弹又在他身边爆炸，扑了他一脸土，但却没有掠去他那正露出的可掬的笑容。
    夺战在敌人心脏的勇士们，从昨天午夜，一直坚持到第二天中午，整整十二个钟头。……突然突破口枪声大作，王营长高喊着：
    “同志们：我们的老大哥团已冲进来了，上好刺刀，跟着我冲出去。”
    勇士们英勇地冲出去了，在极短的时间里，全部占领了曹八集，歼灭了蒋匪“荣二师”。
    王世岗被担架兵从屋里抬出来，他回望着这一带被敌人炮火打得千疮百孔的房屋，有的已经倒塌，有的还在燃烧，他又端详着房屋周围成堆的敌人死尸，不禁想起昨夜在敌人炮火焦点上的英勇的抗击，仿佛又投入了那激烈搏斗的场面里，听到那在爆炸声及厮杀声中，指导员庄严响亮的宣布：批准他入党。……
