    Nanjing Private Industries
    Mostly Resume Production
    [Report from this newspaper] Nanjing News: After the liberation of Nanjing, most of the private factories in the city that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood have resumed production. Five factories, including the Yongli alkali plant, which had been shut down before liberation, quickly resumed work and business thanks to loans from the People's Bank and order loans from trade companies. Since the resumption of work at the Yongli alkali plant, it has produced more than 2,600 tons of sulfuric acid in July. Pufeng Flour Mill can currently produce 1,100 bags of flour per day. Youheng Flour Mill can produce 4,000 bags of flour per day, doubling its output compared to the early days of liberation. The Xin Yi Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory dyed 6,000 bolts of cloth per day in June, and increased production by more than one time in July. In terms of handicrafts, all 31 soap factories in the city have resumed operations after liberation. In mid-July, 27 more were added compared to before liberation. There were 30 soda factories before liberation, and more than 20 have been added after liberation, with a total daily output of 200 dan of soda, doubling the output before liberation. Among the city's 711 cotton weaving handicraft households, there are a total of 587 iron looms and 1,879 wooden looms. Most of them were shut down before liberation. After liberation, the people's government vigorously supported the exchange of yarn for cloth. At present, a total of 907 iron and wooden looms have been put into operation, and 6,716 zhang of cloth can be produced every day. In addition, most of the leather, sock weaving, toothbrush and other industries have also resumed work. As for the industries that the people do not need, they are gradually shrinking. For example, there used to be more than 100 brocade weaving factories, but now only a dozen have resumed work, and sales are not good. Also, the production and sales of food industries such as Guanshengyuan Nanjing Factory have been greatly reduced compared to before liberation. Nanjing after liberation is gradually beginning to shift from a city of consumption to a city of production.

    南京私营工业
    大部恢复生产
    【本报讯】南京消息：南京解放后，全市有利于国计民生的私营工厂大部恢复生产。在解放前停业的永利ｙà＠①厂等五家工厂由于人民银行的贷款扶助和贸易公司的订货贷款很快就复工复业。永利ｙà＠①厂复工以来，七月份已生产硫酸ｙà＠①二千六百多吨。普丰面厂目前每天可生产面粉一千一百袋。有恒面粉厂每天可以生产面粉四千袋，产量比解放初期增加一倍。新益纺织印染厂六月份每天染布六千匹，七月份增产一倍多。在手工业方面全市三十一家肥皂工厂，解放后已全部复业。七月中旬又比解放前增加了二十七家。石碱业在解放前有三十家，解放后增加了二十多家，每天共能出二百担石碱，比解放前提高一倍。全市七百一十一户棉织手工业，共有铁机五百八十七架，木机一千八百七十九架，解放前多数都已停业，解放以后人民政府大力扶助以纱换布，目前已开动铁、木机共九百零七架，每天可以出布六千七百一十六丈。此外，皮革、织袜、牙刷等业，大半数均已复工。至于人民所不需要的行业已日渐萎缩。象织锦业过去有一百多家现在就只有十几家复工，而且销路不好。又如冠生园南京工厂等食品工业生产和销路都比解放前大为降低，解放后的南京正在开始逐步由消费的城市走向生产的城市。
