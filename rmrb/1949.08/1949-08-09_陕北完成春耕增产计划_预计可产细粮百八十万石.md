    Northern Shaanxi Completes Spring Planting Production Increase Plan
    Expected to Produce 1.8 Million Shi of Refined Grains
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Northern Shaanxi News: The Agricultural Department of the Northern Shaanxi Administrative Office recently summarized spring planting production across the entire administrative region, stating that with the exception of Yulin and Jia County, where the disaster was severe and the labor force reduced, preventing the complete fulfillment of the plan, other areas have successfully completed and exceeded their original plans. This has laid the foundation for an estimated 1,884,000+ *shi* of refined grain this year. A total of 16,842,507 *mu* of land were cultivated throughout the region, an increase of 1,157,614 *mu* compared to the 15,684,893 *mu* cultivated last year. Among these, Ansai County exceeded the wasteland reclamation plan by 40%, Yanchuan County originally planned to reclaim 17,312 *mu* of wasteland but completed 37,664 *mu*, Ganquan County originally planned to have each person plant 0.5 *fen* of oilseeds, but actually completed 0.8 *fen*, and the Sanbian area also exceeded the plan. Regarding cotton planting, due to drought preventing timely sowing or frost killing seedlings, it is estimated that only 20%+ will be completed.

    The smooth completion of this year's spring planting plan is due to the old liberated areas' recovery of production in 1948, party rectification, village elections, land redistribution, determination of land rights, assessment of yields, and adjustment of reasonable burdens; the new liberated areas' rent reduction and interest rate reduction, and struggles against feudal despots. Also important were the victorious developments in the Northwest Liberation War, which gradually reduced war support efforts in Northern Shaanxi, all creating favorable conditions for this year's spring planting campaign. At the same time, various regions, in accordance with the Northwest Bureau's instructions on launching this year's spring planting campaign, formulated plans as a direction for their efforts, and held various meetings to disseminate and mobilize, inspect and deploy. Sub-districts convened joint meetings of county secretaries, county heads, section chiefs, and financial and economic cadres, as well as individual county-level three-tier cadre meetings, labor hero meetings, and district secretary and district head meetings, conducting extensive ideological mobilization from cadres to the masses. They widely publicized the policy of enriching oneself through labor and the tasks of this year's great production movement, as well as the victorious military situation. Secondly, in coordination with rural grain loans and relief grain, they organized private mutual aid lending under the principle of lending with repayment, resolving various difficulties in production, gradually dispelling the masses' concerns, and laying the foundation for production confidence. At the same time, the establishment of base leadership and inspection reporting systems, and their conscientious implementation, enabled the exchange of experiences in various regions, allowing problems to be discovered and resolved in a timely manner, overcoming the past problems of shallow and isolated work. All mutual aid teams fully implemented the principles of voluntarism, equivalent value, and small-scale operations based on the needs of the production season. Party members and cadres were able to play a leading role. Various natural disasters, such as droughts, hailstorms, frost damage, and rodent plagues, were also overcome under organized and led efforts. For example, in Yanchuan, where rodent damage was severe, the county party secretary and county head personally led cadres to lead the masses in catching rats, eliminating as many as 150,000 rats throughout the county, as a practical example.

    陕北完成春耕增产计划
    预计可产细粮百八十万石
    【本报讯】陕北消息：陕北行署农业处顷总结全行政区春耕生产称：陕北全境除榆林、葭县一带因灾荒严重，劳力减少，未全部完成计划外，其他各地已顺利完成并超过原订计划；打下了今年预计产细粮一百八十八万四千余石的基础。全区共种地一千六百八十四万二千五百零七亩，比去年耕地一千五百六十八万四千八百九十三亩，增加一百一十五万七千六百一十四亩。其中安塞县超过开荒计划的百分之四十，延川县原计划开荒一万七千三百一十二亩，完成三万七千六百六十四亩，甘泉县原计划每人种油籽五分，结果完成八分，三边亦超过计划。关于植棉，因天旱未能及时下种或冻死棉苗，估计仅能完成百分之二十以上。
    今年春耕计划的顺利完成，是由于老区经过一九四八年恢复生产，整党、乡选、调剂土地、确定地权、评定产量、调整合理负担；新区减租减息、反封建恶霸斗争等准备工作，以及西北解放战争胜利发展，陕北战勤逐渐减少，都给今年开展春耕运动造成有利条件。同时各地又根据西北局关于开展今年春耕运动的指示，订出计划，作为奋斗方向，并召开各种会议，进行传达动员，检查布置。分区召开了县书、县长、四科长财经干部联席会议及个别县的三级干部会，劳英会，区书、区长会，从干部到群众，进行了广泛的思想动员。广泛的宣传了劳动致富政策及今年大生产运动的任务和军事胜利形势。其次配合农村贷粮、救济粮，在贯彻有借有还的借贷原则下组织了私人互助借贷，解决了生产中各种困难，使群众顾虑逐渐解除，奠定了生产信心。同时由于建立据点领导与巡视汇报制度，并认真执行，使各地经验得以交流，发现问题能及时解决，克服了过去工作不深入与孤立的毛病，各个互助组充分作到自愿、等价及小型的以生产季节需要的原则，党员、干部均能起带头作用，各种天灾，如旱灾、冰雹冻灾，鼠灾，亦在有组织有领导之下，战胜了困难，如延川鼠害严重，县委书记与县长即亲率干部领导群众捕鼠，全县灭鼠至十五万只之多，即其实例。
