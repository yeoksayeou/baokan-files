    The Active Communist Youth League in Zhengding High School
    Liang Shiqing, Wang Zhenxi
    I. The Course of Historical Development
    In September 1947, a youth organization emerged in Zhengding High School, initially known as the "Backbone Group." At that time, as the Chiang bandit troops entrenched in Shijiazhuang prepared to move north and our army's Qingfengdian Victory was imminent, the atmosphere along the Shijiazhuang-Baoding line was tense, and the school was forced to evacuate twice. In this context, the fledgling Communist Youth League immediately took on its mission: mobilizing students to leave the city and encouraging their morale during the march; after arriving in the countryside, proactively organizing students to conduct propaganda among the villagers; and diligently developing the organization, expanding the Backbone Group from six to over a dozen members. Due to its proactive role, it quickly earned the glorious title of the Communist Youth League.
    After the land reform began, League members personally participated in the work, and the practical struggle in the countryside greatly enhanced their class consciousness.
    As the Party went public in the school, so did the League. After going public, League members actively promoted the League's mass character and its role among the youth, planting seeds of joining the League in the minds of some students. The League's mass character grew, and it gained prestige among the masses, so many students began to gravitate towards the League.
    Last March, the school called on students to study at the Military and Political University and receive training as code clerks – dozens of League members signed up. Driven by them (and the great strength of Party members), many students scrambled to go. Party and League members led the way, and sixty students happily left the school.
    On the day commemorating "May Fourth," the school held a large-scale achievement exhibition and a model student election campaign, during which many model students and activists emerged. They had a strong desire for progress in their thinking. At this time, with the help of the Party, the League implemented a universal League building campaign, under the management of the class student unions. Using democratic discussion and mass recommendation, it absorbed outstanding individuals who had prestige among the masses, studied diligently, and worked actively, into the League. Later facts proved that adopting this method for large-scale League building at the beginning was entirely necessary and appropriate. After this League building, the number of League members expanded to forty-nine. From then on, the Communist Youth League became an indispensable force in the entire school life.
    The fact of democratic League building shattered some students' misconceptions and doubts about the League, making them understand the League's nature. Some students who wanted to make progress wrote "voluntary applications" and "applications" requesting to join the League.
    Later, the school successively carried out rectification of the Party and "investigation of study," the great relocation and "school construction," the opposition to an unstructured and undisciplined state, greening the school, and the "teaching" and "learning" great competition that is currently underway. In these movements, League members were tempered, and several groups of activists emerged outside the League, and the League absorbed them separately. Now the school's Communist Youth League has become a mass, powerful organization with 103 League members, including 21 female League members.
    In addition, the League established the Young Pioneers organization this year on "April Fourth," absorbing thirty-two child students. The League sent excellent cadres to lead them.
 II. The New Face of the League
    After the establishment of the Central Committee of the League, it opened a new page in the history of the school's Communist Youth League, starting a new life for League members. At this time, the League obtained its program and goals of struggle from the documents and instructions of the Central Committee of the League. The League used these to educate League members, enabling them to correctly understand the nature and tasks of the League. The League's organization was gradually strengthened and improved, giving the League great ideological and fighting power. At this time, League members made leaps and bounds in progress. Zhou Yingxin of Class Three, under the education of the League, made an active request to join the Party; Zhao Xuexiang of Class Six, after reading "China Youth" and the "Youth Handbook" (youth teaching materials compiled and printed by the school), realized that his progress over the past year was entirely due to the education of the League. Not long after joining the League, female League member Wang Xiurong resolved the confused ideas that had existed in her mind for a long time. In the wall newspaper commemorating "July First," she wrote powerfully in concise words: "In the past, my understanding of the Party and the League was very poor, but since joining the League, my thinking has quickly become clear. I know that the Party and the League are entirely dedicated to serving the people. I know that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can China achieve freedom, happiness, and true liberation, and can my own future always move towards brightness."
    At this time, the League established a system of learning and life. League classes were held once a week to study Mao Zedong Thought; group discussion meetings were held once a week to conduct self-criticism and mutual criticism; monthly tests were conducted to understand the learning situation of League members and promote their efforts; and a League member library was established, with "China Youth" becoming the most beloved reading material for League members.
    League members clarified the relationship between the Party, the League, and the masses through learning, and changed the understanding that "the League is subordinate to the Party and the school"; moreover, they understood that the League should respond to the school's call under the leadership of the Party to complete the learning plan. The mass League building method adopted in the past was also changed at this time, and League members were absorbed individually in a planned manner according to the provisions of the League Constitution. The League's improvements in all aspects have transformed it into a new face.
 III. Taking the Lead in Studying and Working
    League members warmly responded to the League's call – taking the lead in studying and working. In each exam, not only were there no failures, but many League members ranked in the top three or top five. Wu Qingfen, a fifteen-year-old Young Pioneer, fought for second place out of sixty-three people in the class and wanted to continue striving for first place. League members Li Shaolin and Liu Zhengwei did well in all kinds of assignments, and they won first prizes at the achievement exhibition. Many League members are not only models of learning mutual assistance, but also strong cadres of the student union. For example, Zhang Qingyun, Lu Jingjing, Zhao Zongtao, Li Wenzhang, etc., are all the most supported model students in the class for learning, mutual assistance, and work.
    All the school's work is inseparable from the active leadership of League members. Last fall, during the "investigation of study," League members affirmed the school's achievements on the one hand, and sincerely and frankly provided criticism and suggestions for improvement to the school on the other hand. At the same time, they seriously examined themselves, setting an example of bold criticism for non-League members. During the rectification of the Party, Party members went to participate in meetings, and League members took on the task of "maintaining everyone's normal learning mood." After the great relocation began, League members were even more eager to take the lead. In the transportation team organized by the school with more than 400 students participating, they carried heavy loads and pushed hard on a road of about thirteen or fourteen miles back and forth, demonstrating the youth's perseverance and courage. During the school construction and greening movement, League members actively participated in many construction tasks such as moving bricks, building walls, leveling courtyards, paving roads, removing broken tiles, clearing rotten grass, planting trees and flowers, and planting vegetable gardens. In these labors, female League members did not lag behind. In the current great learning competition movement, League members have become the backbone of this movement.
    League members also actively participate in sports activities and social activities, paying attention to operations, playing ball, singing, and performing dramas. In a sports competition, Young Pioneer Liu Guilin won three first places in borrowing objects, rope skipping, walking race, and running calculation. Female League members Li Sujie, Qiang Jihua, etc., have been trained into excellent actors in the continuous propaganda to the masses. League members are always taking the lead in learning and work.
 IV. Forever Moving Forward Under the Leadership of the Communist Party
    This year on "July First," Party members held a conference to commemorate the Party's birthday. League members attended as observers. Under the shining of the red Party flag, in front of the huge portrait of Chairman Mao, Party members were all very excited. At this time, the League members' hearts seemed even more excited. Why? Because they wanted to offer a gift to the Party. When the Party representative accepted their dedication flag, they happily shouted out the big characters on the flag: "Forever moving forward under the leadership of the Communist Party!"
    Indeed, the school's Communist Youth League still has a shortcoming that needs to be overcome under the Party's strong leadership to make the League's work more active. For example: some new League members do not have a high level of awareness and cannot seriously implement the League's resolutions; some have a weak sense of organization and do not care about the League's life; and some have a low level of education, which hinders the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The League must move forward under the leadership of the Party. Therefore, League members often say: "We must overcome our shortcomings under the leadership of the Communist Party and transform ourselves into glorious Party members in the process of moving forward!"

    活跃在正定中学的青年团
    梁世清  王镇西
    一  历史的发展过程
    一九四七年的九月，在正定中学里产生了青年的组织，它的幼年名称是“骨干小组”。这时正是困守在石家庄的蒋匪军准备北上，我军清风店大捷快要实现的时候，石保线上的空气很紧张，学校被迫二次撤出。在这种时候产生的青年团的幼苗便马上担负起了它的任务：动员同学出城，鼓励同学的行军情绪；到了乡村以后，主动组织同学向老乡宣传；同时又认真地发展了组织，使骨干小组由六人扩大到十数人。由于它的积极作用，很快便获得了青年团的光荣称号。
    土地改革开始后，团员亲身参加了工作，农村的实际斗争大大地提高了他们的阶级觉悟。
    随着学校党的公开，团也公开了。团员在团公开后，积极宣传团的群众性和他在青年中的作用，使一部分同学思想中孕育下入团的种子。团的群众性增长了，在群众中有了威信，于是许多同学开始向团靠拢。
    去年三月，学校号召同学到军大学习和受译电员训练——十数个团员都报了名。在他们（还有党员的很大力量）的带动下，许多同学也抢着要去。党、团员打先锋，六十名同学高高兴兴地离开了学校。
    纪念“五四”那天学校举行了大规模的成绩展览会和模范学员选举运动，在运动中涌出了不少模范学员和积极分子。他们思想上要求进步。团就在这时，在党的帮助之下，实行普遍建团。以班学生会掌握。采用民主讨论，群众荐举的方式，把在群众中有威信的、学习努力、工作积极的优秀分子吸收入了团。后来的事实证明，在开始采用这种方式以大规模的建团，是完全必要和应该的。经过这样的建团之后，团员扩大到四十九人。从此，青年团在整个的学校生活中便成了不可缺少的力量。
    民主建团的事实，打破了某些同学对团的错误认识和怀疑，使他们认识了团的性质。有些要求进步的同学，便写了“志愿书”和“申请书”请求入团。
    后来，学校先后进行了整党与“查学”、大搬家和“建校”、反对无组织无纪律状态、绿化学校和现在正在开展的“教”“学”大竞赛等运动。在这些运动中，团员受到了锻炼，同时在团外又涌现出了好几批积极分子，团都分别地把他们吸收了进来。现在学校青年团已成了一个拥有一○三名团员的群众性的强大组织，其中有二十一名是女团员。
    此外，团又在今年“四四”建立了少年先锋队的组织，吸收了三十二个儿童同学。团派了优秀的干部去领导他们。
  二  团的新面目
    团中央产生以后，给学校的青年团开创了历史的新页，使团员开始了新生活。团在这时由团中央的文件指示中获得了奋斗的纲领和目标。团用这些来教育团员，使团员正确的认识了团的性质和任务。团的组织逐步健全和加强起来，使团具有了很大的思想性、战斗性。这时团员都有了飞跃的进步，三班周英欣在团的教育下提出了入党的积极要求；六班赵学湘读了中国青年和青年手册（学校编印的青年教材）后，认识了自己一年来的进步，完全是由于受了团的教育的原因。女团员王秀荣入团不久，便解决了好久存在于脑子里的糊涂观念。在纪念“七一”的壁报上，她用了简短的文字有力的写道：“过去对党团的了解很差，可是自从入团以后，思想上很快的清醒了，知道了党和团完完全全是为了人民服务的，知道了只有在共产党的领导之下才能使中国得到自由幸福及真正解放，自己的前途也才能够永远走向光明。”
    这时候团里建立起了学习和生活的制度。每星期上一次团课，学习毛泽东思想；开一次小组讨论会，进行自我批评与互相批评；每月进行一次测验，以了解团员的学习情况并促其努力；还建立了团员图书室，“中国青年”成了团员最喜爱的读物。
    团员从学习中明确了党和团及和群众的关系，改变了“团附属于党和学校”的认识；而且了解到团要在党的领导之下响应学校的号召去完成学习计划。过去采用的群众建团的方式在这时也改变了，根据团章的规定去实行有计划地个别的吸收团员。团在各方面的改进，已使它变成了新的面貌。
  三、学习、工作打先锋
    团员们热烈的响应了团的号召——学习工作打先锋。在每次考试中，不但没有不及格的，并且有不少的团员考入了前三名或前五名。十五岁的女少先队员吴青芬在全班六十三人中争得了第二还不算，还要继续争第一。团员李绍林、刘正位各种作业都很好，在成绩展览会上，他们荣获甲等奖。不少的团员不但是学习互助的楷模，同时又是学生会的坚强干部。如张庆云、鲁进京、赵宗韬、李文章等都是在班里最受拥护的学习、互助、工作最好的模范学员。
    学校的一切工作，都离不开团员的积极带头。去秋“查学”时，团员一面肯定了学校的成绩，一面又诚恳坦白地给学校提供了批评和改进的意见。同时又认真的检查了自己，给非团员树立了大胆批评的榜样。整党中，党员去参加会议，团员便担当起“保持大家学习情绪正常”的任务。大搬家开始以后，团员们更是勇于当先，在学校组织的四百余同学参加的运输大队中，他们重背重抬重担重推地在一条往返约十三、四里长的道路上，发挥着青年的刚毅和勇敢。建校和绿化运动中，团员们又积极地参加了搬砖、垒墙、平院落铺马路、除碎瓦、清烂草、植树栽花、种菜园等许多修建工作。在这些劳动中，女团员也不落后。现在进行的学习大竞赛运动，团员又成了这一个运动中的骨干。
    团员们同时积极的参加体育活动和社会活动，注意了操作、玩球、唱歌和演剧，在一次体育竞赛中，少先队员刘桂林获得了借物、跳绳竞走和跑算三个第一。女团员李素杰、强计花等在不断的向群众宣传中已锻炼成了优秀的演员。团员在学习、工作中永远是打先锋的。
  四、在共产党的领导下永远前进
    今年“七一”，党员开大会，纪念党的生日。团员们都列席参加。在红色党旗的普照下，在毛主席的巨幅画像前面，党员们个个很兴奋。这时团员们的心里似乎更兴奋。为什么呢？因为他们要给党献礼。当党代表接受了他们的献旗的时候，他们高兴的呼出旗子上面的大字：“在共产党的领导下永远前进！”
    的确，学校青年团还有一个缺点，需要在党的坚强领导下把它克服，使团的工作更活跃。例如：有的新团员觉悟程度还不高，对团的决议不能认真执行；有的组织观念不强，不关心团的生活；还有的文化水平较低，阻碍了对马列主义和毛泽东思想的学习。团要在党的领导下前进。所以，团员们常常说：“我们一定要在共产党的领导下，克服缺点，在前进中使我们变为一个光荣的党员！”
