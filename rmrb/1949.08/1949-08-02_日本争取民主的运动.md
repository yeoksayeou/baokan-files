    Japan's Struggle for Democracy
    By Tokuda Kyuichi, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party

    Japan is on the Asian frontier in the Pacific. In the past, this country's geographical position was an important factor in the development of Japanese imperialism. Today, Anglo-American monopoly capital is using Japan as one of its stepping stones to dominate the world. This is why Japanese monopolists and their agents unanimously believe that the only way to secure their future is to form a close alliance with international monopoly capital.

    After Japan's surrender in August 1945 (which was a decisive blow to the Emperor system), Japanese monopoly capital was thrown into a state of chaos. But with the formation of the liberal "progressive" coalition cabinet—the first Yoshida cabinet—in June 1946, Japanese monopoly capital turned from its military defeat to revival, and launched a vicious attack on workers, farmers, fishermen, small and medium industrialists and merchants. At the same time, it began to form an alliance with international monopoly capital. The military and bureaucratic groups who held privileged positions under the old Emperor system took advantage of this situation to resume their activities.

    Prime Minister Yoshida is a competent representative of Japanese imperialism. He was formerly the Consul-General in Shenyang, and later the Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs under General Tanaka, who was Prime Minister from 1927 to 1929. During this term of office, he helped lay the foundation for the policy of aggression against China, the first step towards aggression against the world. The warlords, bureaucrats and big industrialists who inherited the traditions of Japanese imperialism have every reason to focus their hopes on Yoshida.

    Everyone knows that these elements are again active, openly or secretly. They expanded their reactionary activities during the Katayama and Ashida cabinets, which were a coalition of the People's Cooperative Party and the Social Democratic Party, using right-wing Social Democrats as their tools and supporting the fanatical Trotskyist bandits. This preparation for the march towards fascism is developing at an accelerated pace, especially since the formation of the third Yoshida cabinet in February this year.

    The main characteristics of the Yoshida cabinet and its supporters are to seek the best way to serve Anglo-American monopoly capital and to win its material and spiritual assistance in order to consolidate the rule of Japanese monopoly capital.

    The reactionary government is strengthening financial capital by transferring the powers of financial institutions, formerly held by state bureaucracies, to powerful private banks, with the result that direct alliances between these banks and foreign banks are made possible. Moreover, the abolition of certain restrictions on industry facilitates the control of industry by private financial capital.

    As a result of the reactionary government's policies, Japan's foreign trade is suffering losses, while foreign capital is making huge profits. The price of American imports is three times higher than the official price stipulated by Japan for these goods, while the selling price of exports is one-third or less of the international standard price. The people must bear the brunt of these losses, while the monopolists reap huge profits. This policy is leading the country to a state of economic enslavement.

    Through administrative measures relating to prices, taxation, labor legislation, etc., state power is only used to protect the interests of compradore monopoly capital.

    The Yoshida government is trying to restore the landlord exploitation system and is restoring the social basis of militarism by raising land rents and delaying the implementation of land reform.

    The Yoshida government is reducing national education, science, technology, culture and art to colonial levels with material and spiritual assistance. At the same time, the reactionary government is strengthening its system of oppression in order to suppress the popular resistance to the Japanese ruling clique's comprador policy, which can only lead to the loss of national independence, freedom and peace, the impoverishment of workers, farmers and fishermen, and the bankruptcy of small and medium industrialists and landlords. The reactionary government is doing everything in its power to isolate the Communist Party and is strengthening fascist oppression against the Communist Party.

    All this is leading to a constant sharpening of class antagonism and internal contradictions. Opposing the handful of monopolists and their agents are the broad masses of the people, even some representatives of capitalist groups and small and medium landlords.

    The struggle is no longer limited to strikes, go-slows, demonstrations, land disputes and refusal to pay taxes. It has become a widespread national political movement to defend national industry, education and culture, and to defend the survival of our nation. This powerful offensive by the people, led by the working class, has aroused all strata of society. This struggle against the government is also attracting government officials and lower-middle-level Democratic Liberal Party members to its ranks, and is exposing corruption in cities and villages. The people are becoming increasingly angry and resentful of the police and financial organs that are implementing the Yoshida government's anti-people policies.

    The broad masses of the people have a long tradition of actively participating in the democratic movement. As early as the 1890s, the Japanese trade union movement greatly helped to arouse the revolutionary spirit of the masses. An organized peasant movement developed in the early years of this century.

    The Japanese Communist Party stands at the forefront of this struggle, exposing the traitorous policies of the Democratic Liberal Party, which holds an absolute majority in the current parliament. The lower echelons of the Democratic Liberal Party are forced to stand on the side of the people because they fear that otherwise they will be swept aside by the people's universal anger. As a result, the major monopolists and their agents are forced into greater isolation.

    The experience that the Communist Party has accumulated in the face of long periods of barbaric military and police persecution is helping it to lead this broad people's movement in the post-war period. It should be noted that the struggle of the Japanese people is consistently led in accordance with the principles of Marxism-Leninism.

    The struggle of the broad masses of the people to liberate themselves from colonial shackles and foreign enslavement is gaining momentum in the Far East. The leadership of this struggle has been transferred from bourgeois nationalists to parties guided by the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin. The Japanese struggle for democracy is one of the battlefields of the world democratic movement. (Translated by Tang Ren from "For Lasting Peace and People's Democracy," No. 38)

    日本争取民主的运动
    日共总书记  德田球一
    日本是在太平洋上的亚洲的边疆。在过去，这一国家的地理位置是日本帝国主义发展的一个重要因素。今日，英美垄断资本把日本当作它走向支配世界的跳板之一。这就是为什么日本垄断资本家和他们的代理人一致认为，保障他们的未来的唯一方法是与国际垄断资本结成密切的联盟。
    日本于一九四五年八月投降以后（这对天皇制度是一个决定性的打击），日本垄断资本被投入混乱状态中。但是随着自由“进步”联合内阁——第一届吉田内阁——于一九四六年六月的组成，日本垄断资本从它的军事失败转为复活了，并进而对工人、农民、渔民、中小工业家与商人发动恶毒的攻击。同时，它开始与国际垄断资本结成联盟。在旧日天皇制度下据有特权地位的军阀与官僚集团，利用这一局势恢复了他们的活动。
    吉田首相是日本帝国主义的一个称职的代表。他过去是驻沈阳的总领事，以后是由一九二七到一九二九年任内阁首相的田中大将手下的外务次官。在此项任内，他帮助打下了侵略中国政策的基础，走向侵略世界的第一步。继承日本帝国主义传统的军阀、官僚与大工业家，有一切理由将其希望集中于吉田。
    人人都晓得，这些分子又公开地或隐秘地活跃起来。他们在国民协同党与社会民主党联合的片山与芦田内阁时期扩大他们的反动活动，利用右翼社会民主党人作他们的工具，并扶助疯狂的托洛茨基匪徒。这样准备的向法西斯主义的行进，正在以加快的速度发展着，特别是从今年二月第三届吉田内阁组成以后。
    吉田内阁，和它的支持者的主要特点，是寻求为英美垄断资本服务的最好方法，并赢得它的物质的与精神的援助，以巩固日本垄断资本的统治。
    反动政府正在把过去由国家官僚机构掌握的财政机关的职权移交给有势力的私人银行，借以加强财政资本，结果是使这些银行与外国银行之间的直接联盟成为可能。而且，因为取消对工业的某些限制，便利了私人财政资本对工业的控制。
    由于反动政府政策的结果，日本的对外贸易正遭受损失，而外国资本则正获得庞大的利润。美国进口的价格高于日本为此项货品所规定的官价三倍，而输出货品的售价则为国际标准价格的三分之一或者更少。人民必须担负此项损失的重担，而垄断资本家却赚得了巨额利润。此种政策正在把国家导向经济的奴役地位。
    借于物价、征税、劳动立法等等的行政措施，国家权力仅只被用于保护买办垄断资本的利益。
    吉田政府正试图恢复地主剥削制度，并以抬高地租与延不实行土地改革为恢复军国主义社会基础。
    吉田政府正在由物质上与精神上的协助把国民教育、科学、技术、文化与艺术降低到殖民地的水平。同时，反动政府正在加强它的压迫制度，其目的在镇压民众对日本统治集团的买办政策之普遍反抗，此项政策只有造成损失国家的独立、自由与和平，造成工人、农民与渔民的贫困，造成中小工业家与地主的破产。反动政府正在尽一切力量孤立共产党，并在加强法西斯的压迫以反对共产党。
    这一切在导向阶级对立与内部矛盾之不断的尖锐化。反对寥寥可数的垄断者和他们的代理人的是人民的广大阶层，甚至是资本家集团与中小地主的某些代表。
    斗争已不限于罢工、怠工、示威、土地纠纷与拒绝纳税。它已变成一个普遍全国的政治运动，以保卫民族工业、教育与文化，保卫我们民族的生存。这种以工人阶级为前锋的人民的强大攻势，已经唤起了社会的各阶层。这一反对政府的斗争也正在把政府官吏与中下层的民主自由党人吸引到它的轨道，并在揭露城市与乡村的贪污与腐化。人民对执行吉田政府反人民政策的警察与财政机关，正变得日益愤怒与痛恨。
    广大人民群众积极参加民主运动，有着长时期的传统。远在前一世纪的九十年代，日本的职工会运动曾大有助于唤起群众的革命精神。有组织的农民运动在本世纪初叶已发展起来。
    日本共产党站在这一斗争的前头，揭露现在议会中握有绝对多数的民主自由党的叛卖政策。民主自由党的下层组织被迫站到人民一方，因为他们害怕：不然的话，他们将被人民的普遍的愤怒扫落到一旁。结果，各大垄断家与他们的代理人们逼迫得更加孤立了。
    共产党在长时期野蛮的军事与警察迫害中所积累的经验，正在帮助它领导这战后时期的广大人民的运动。应该注意，日本人民的斗争是一贯按照马克斯列宁主义的原则所领导的。
    人民大众争取从殖民地羁轭与外国的奴役下解放出来的斗争，其声势在远东日益壮阔。这一斗争的领导权已经由资产阶级的民族主义者转到为马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说所指导的党。日本争取民主的斗争是世界民主运动的战场之一。（唐人译自“争取持久和平与人民民主”第三十八期）
