    Some Disaster Victims to be Relocated to the Northeast for Production
    [Baoding Electricity] In order to assist the Hebei Provincial People's Government in vigorously promoting production for disaster relief, the Hebei Provincial Disaster Relief Committee held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 17th, announcing its official establishment. At the meeting, Vice Chairman Luo Yuchuan specifically explained the serious disaster situation in Hebei Province this year, and pointed out that it is necessary to mobilize the people of the entire province to pool their wisdom and efforts to overcome all difficulties and get through this serious disaster.
    [Baoding Electricity] Recently, various disasters in Hebei Province have become increasingly serious. People's governments at all levels throughout the province are vigorously organizing people in disaster areas to engage in production for self-relief, and are carrying out necessary relief efforts. In some severely affected areas, people's lives are extremely difficult, and they are requesting relocation to the Northeast. To this end, the Hebei Provincial People's Government has specially dispatched Zhang Zhenyu, Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture, leading nine cadres, to the North China People's Government on the 16th to request specific instructions. They will then proceed to the Northeast to discuss immigration issues with the Northeast authorities, in order to solve the production and living difficulties of the relocated disaster victims.
