　　How to Transform Alkaline Land? What Alkaline Land Can Be Transformed?
　　Liu Luoxiao et al. Share Experiences in a Forum
　　Jizhong Agricultural Survey Team
　　Liu Luoxiao, a seventy-year-old well-drilling worker from Nanloudi Village, An'guo First District, has been drilling wells for more than forty years. He has created successful experiences in drilling Yang wells, transforming alkaline water into fresh water, and transforming alkaline land into good land. This experience makes a great contribution to increasing agricultural production. In An'guo and other places, all alkaline land transformed using this method has achieved great success. The reporter, considering that there is currently a lot of alkaline land on the North China Plain, believes that if this experience can be widely promoted and all alkaline land can be turned into good land (note: after each mu of alkaline land is turned into dry land, its yield can be equivalent to four mu of dry land), the annual increase in agricultural production will be astonishing. Therefore, a forum on transforming alkaline land was held, and well-drilling experts Liu Luoxiao, Li Kunshan, Wang Xiaode, and Song Zhiyi were invited to attend.

　　Reporter: Please talk about your well-drilling process first. What are the benefits?

　　Li Kunshan: There are many benefits! I am fifty-eight years old this year and have led two well-drilling teams, drilling wells for more than twenty years. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, I drilled wells in Gaoyang, Boye, and Lixian for a long time. When drilling wells in Boye, people were initially unwilling to drill. A family named Kong asked us to drill twenty-two wells, each equipped with a large waterwheel, and planted more than eight qing of land. That year, there was a drought, and other people's land did not yield any grain, but his land grew cotton, yielding more than two hundred catties of seed cotton per mu. After that, everyone started drilling wells.

　　Song Zhiyi: Nanloudi Village in An'guo has more than 1,000 mu of garden land, of which more than 500 mu have been transformed from alkaline land. The Song Luowan family and several others own a hundred mu of alkaline land and have drilled four wells. In the past, those lands did not sprout, but after drilling wells and irrigating with fresh water, the seedlings grew well.

　　Reporter: Is this method applicable to all regions? Can all alkaline land be transformed?

　　Liu Luoxiao: Wuyi and Hengshui have a lot of alkaline land, which can be transformed. The seven counties east of the Grand Canal, including Cangzhou, Nanpi, and Yanshan, are all sea-reclaimed land (i.e., land after the sea has receded), without sand and no water, so they cannot be transformed. The counties west of the Grand Canal can all drill wells.

　　Liu Luoxiao: All alkaline land that can be used to drill wells can be transformed! Slightly alkaline land can be irrigated in one year! There are two types of alkaline land: green alkaline and white alkaline. Green alkaline land produces salt, and white alkaline land produces saltpeter. White alkaline land can be irrigated in one or two years, while green alkaline land needs to be irrigated for several years to be completely transformed! In Wuyi area, green alkaline land cannot grow crops, but after transformation, even Sizitou cotton can be grown. It is best to grow cotton at the beginning, and sorghum and millet are also fine. You cannot grow yams and garlic. After a few years of irrigating and washing away the alkali, other crops can be grown. After a few years of transformation, vegetables can be grown.

　　Song Zhiyi: The method of planting in alkaline land also needs attention! In the first year, deep furrows should be plowed, and water should be poured into the furrows. When the alkali encounters water, it will be pulled to the edge of the furrows. Then, seeds should be sown in the furrows and watered frequently. After planting for two or three years like this, it will get better year by year. After three years, all the alkaline land can be transformed into good land.

　　Reporter: Besides irrigating, what other benefits are there to drilling Yang wells?

　　Wang Xiaode: It can also solve the drinking water difficulties of the people in alkaline areas.

　　Liu Luoxiao: Before the incident, there were more than forty well-drilling teams in our village, but unfortunately, after the incident, when the Japanese devils came, they all collapsed, leaving only eleven frames. Otherwise, it would have developed.

　　This matter must be done well; only the government can initiate it.

　　Li Kunshan: This matter must be done, and only the government can initiate it!

　　Liu Luoxiao: Drilling wells costs a lot of money. Last year, drilling a well in Raoyang cost 7 million border currency. Now, drilling a well requires nine workers a day, twelve catties of millet per person per day, a total of 4,320 catties of millet for forty days. Including food, it costs five to six thousand catties of millet, plus bricks, wood, lead wire, and ＠, the expenses are very large, and ordinary farmers cannot afford it.

　　Finally, everyone's unanimous opinion can be said to be a conclusion to this forum: First, the government should encourage widespread well-drilling and promote methods and experiences in transforming alkaline land; alkaline land that has wells drilled should not or should have reduced burdens for the first three years; second, drilling wells costs a lot of money, each well requires six thousand to ten thousand catties of millet. The common people cannot afford it for a while. The government can either call on several families to drill a well together or provide financial assistance; third, it is suggested that the government establish experimental farms for transforming alkaline land at state expense in areas with a lot of alkaline land; fourth, an organization for a transforming alkaline land committee should be established, led by the government's agricultural department, with experienced people participating to be responsible for guiding the work of transforming alkaline land. Start well-drilling training classes to train well-drilling talents! Liu Luoxiao said: Although he is old, he is still willing to come out to be responsible for guiding well-drilling and transforming alkaline land.

　　怎样改造硷地？什么硷地可以改造？
  　刘洛晓等座谈经验
    冀中农业考察组
    安国一区南楼底村七十岁的打井工人刘洛晓，先后打井四十多年，创造了凿掘洋井，改硷水为甜水，改硷地为好地的成功经验。此种经验对增加农业的贡献极大。安国各地凡采用此种办法改造的硷地，都获得很大成功。记者鉴于目前华北平原上硷地极多，如能普遍推广此种经验，把所有硷地都变成好地（按：每亩硷地变成旱地以后，其产量可相当四亩旱地。），每年增加的农产将是惊人的。于是召开了一个改造硷地座谈会，打井能手刘洛晓、李昆山、王晓得、宋之义等都应邀出席。
    记者：请诸位先将打井的经过谈谈，有那些好处？
    李昆山：好处是很多的！我今年五十八岁，领导过两个打井班，打井二十多年。民国五年在高阳、博野、蠡县打井很久。在博野打井时，人们开始都不愿打。一家姓孔的请我们打了二十二个眼，每眼按上一个大水车，种了八顷多地，那年天旱，别人的地没收粮食，他的地种棉花，每亩收了二百多斤籽棉。以后都打起井来了。
    宋之义：安国南楼底村有一千多亩园地，其中五百多亩是由硷地改造过来的。宋洛万几家共有硷地百十亩，打了四个井。过去那些地不出苗，打了井，用甜水浇，苗就好起来了。
    记者：这种办法，是不是所有的地区都能适用？都能改造？
    刘洛晓：武邑、衡水硷地多，能改造；运河以东的沧州、南皮、盐山等七县，都是海脱地（即海水退去之后的地），无沙，不出水，不能改造；运河以西的县份都能打井。
    刘洛晓：所有的硷地，能打井的都能改造！硷轻的一年就浇过来了！硷地有青硷、白硷两种，青硷地出盐，白硷地出硝，白硷地一二年就能浇过来，青硷地得多浇几年，才能完全改造过来！武邑一带的青硷地种庄稼不出苗，经改造后，种斯字棉都行了。开始种棉花最好，种高粱谷子也行，不能种山药和蒜，要种过几年，把硷都浇下去，种别的作物就行了。改造过几年，就能种菜了。
    宋之义：硷地的种法，也得讲究！第一年要犁成深沟，水浇到沟里，硷遇水就拔到沟沿上了，然后在沟里耩上种子，经常浇水，这样种上二三年，一年比一年好，三年以后，就能把硷地全改成好地。
    记者：打洋井除浇地外，还有什么好处没有？
    王晓得：还可以解决硷地群众的吃水困难。
    刘洛晓：事变前本村打井班就开展到四十多班，可惜事变后，日本鬼子一来，就都垮了，只剩下了十一盘架子，要不，就发展起来了。
　　这事要搞好　只有政府发动才行
    李昆山：这事要搞，只有政府发动才行！
    刘洛晓：打井花钱多，去年在饶阳打一眼井，得边币七百多万元，现在打一眼井，每天九个工，每天每人十二斤小米，共四十天，得用小米工资四千三百二十斤，加上吃的，得五六千斤小米，还有砖、木料、铅丝、＠等，开支很大，普通农民打不起。
    最后，大家一致的意见，可说是对这个座谈会作了结论：第一、政府应奖励普遍打井，推广改造硷地的办法和经验；凡硷地打井的，头三年应不拿或少拿负担；第二、打井花钱很多，每眼井得用六千斤到一万斤小米。老百姓一时拿不起，政府可一面号召几家合打一井，或给以经济上的援助；第三、建议政府在硷地多的地方，由国家出钱建立改造硷地的实验农场；第四、成立改造硷地委员会的组织，由政府农业部门领导，找有经验的人参加，负责指导改造硷地工作。开办打井训练班，培养打井人才！刘洛晓表示：他虽年老，但还愿意出来负责指导打井、改造硷地的工作。  　（冀中农业考察组）
