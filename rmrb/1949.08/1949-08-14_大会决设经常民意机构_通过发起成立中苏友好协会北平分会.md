    【Ping City News】 The fifth day of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference (August 13th), the main agenda was the discussion of proposals. Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, personally came to the conference at 5:20 pm to speak, instructing the people of all circles in Beijing on their future tasks. The conference enthusiastically discussed Chairman Mao's speech and unanimously resolved to resolutely complete the glorious tasks given by Chairman Mao.
    In the morning, the conference first discussed the "Proposal to Support the Establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and to Initiate the Establishment of the Beijing Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association by the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference," signed by 279 representatives. The meeting unanimously approved that the conference should initiate and prepare for the establishment of the Beijing Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Subsequently, Zhao Zhensheng, the convener of the proposal review committee, reported on the proposal review process, explaining that the review committee received a total of 248 proposals and conducted the review based on the democratic principles of New Democracy, adopting a pragmatic attitude and opposing bourgeois democracy, allowing the broad masses to fully express their opinions. Therefore, the proposals were handled in four ways: 1. Those to be handled by the government immediately; 2. Those to be implemented after revision; 3. Those to be postponed or transferred to relevant departments for research; 4. Only those with incorrect opinions were rejected. Then Comrade Peng Zhen gave an explanation that the handling methods of the proposals were: Those that should be done and could be done must be done; Those that should be done but could not be done temporarily, or had no power to do, would be postponed; Those with incorrect opinions would not be done. A part of the opinions are wrong, and another part are right, so we will actively correct them. Tan Zhengwen, the convener of the political and legal security group of the proposal review committee, reported that there were originally 24 proposals in the political and legal security category, which were merged into 15 after review. The conference decided to send 9 proposals to the government and other relevant agencies for adoption, and submitted 6 proposals to the conference for discussion. Subsequently, Wang Feiran, President of the Beijing Municipal People's Court, and Dong Ruqin, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, explained the political and legal work of the court and the Civil Affairs Bureau. After discussion, the conference passed five proposals: "Request the establishment of a permanent public opinion body and accept people's suggestions in various ways to strengthen the connection between the people and the government," "Severely punish the leading or continuing Kuomintang secret agents and bandits," "Further strengthen public security work," "Disperse the population to facilitate production," and "Transform prostitutes to participate in production to reduce the parasitic population." During the discussion on the proposal to establish a permanent public opinion body to strengthen the connection between the people and the government, a heated debate occurred. Liang Chengrui and Zhang Dahe, representatives of the Student Federation, Qiu Fangyu, representative of the Industrial Trade Union, Hua Nangui, representative of the engineering community, and Han Songshang, representative of the banking community, stated at the beginning that in the current period of implementing streamlining and thrift, setting up more institutions would waste financial resources. Public security outposts in each district of Beijing have been generally established, and the people can reflect their opinions to the government through the outposts, and can also use the organizations of mass organizations and newspapers and news agencies to reflect their opinions to the government. There is no need to set up this kind of permanent public opinion body. Du Renzhi, representative of the Beijing Municipal Branch of the Democratic League, Peng Zhen and Liu Ren, representatives of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhang Youyu, representative of the Municipal Government, and Xu Liqun, representative of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, spoke successively, believing that after the closing of the People's Representative Conference, it is necessary to establish a permanent liaison organization including various democratic parties and people's organizations and representatives of people from all walks of life to strengthen contact, and through this permanent public opinion organization, reflect the opinions of the people to strengthen the connection between the government and the people. The representatives' speeches and debates lasted for more than an hour. Finally, representatives such as Liang Chengrui, Zhang Dahe, and Qiu Fangyu changed their views and automatically withdrew their objections, and the entire audience unanimously passed the original proposal.
    In the afternoon, the conference discussed proposals on municipal construction and cultural, educational and health matters. Liang Sicheng, convener of the municipal construction group of the proposal review committee, and Xue Chengye, convener of the cultural, educational and health group, respectively reported on the review process of the two types of proposals. Hou Junyan, Deputy Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Zhang Wenqi, Deputy Director of the Health Bureau, respectively explained the cultural, educational and health work of the government. There were originally 39 proposals on municipal construction, which were merged into 36 after review. 4 proposals were submitted to the conference for discussion, and a total of 30 proposals were submitted to the municipal government or other agencies for adoption, and 2 proposals were retained. After discussion, the conference passed 4 proposals, including "Strengthening the Beijing Municipal Urban Planning Committee" and "Establishing a Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery Memorial Hall to Commend the Loyal and Inspire the Masses." Liang Sicheng, a representative of the engineering community, said when discussing the proposal to strengthen the Beijing Municipal Urban Planning Committee: "We must build a healthy living environment for the people and learn from the spirit of urban construction in the Soviet Union to build our Beijing."
    There were originally 27 cultural and educational proposals, which were merged into 21 after review. 3 proposals were submitted to the conference for discussion, 2 proposals were rejected, and the remaining 16 proposals were submitted to the municipal government for handling or to relevant agencies for adoption. During the discussion of cultural and educational proposals, a heated debate also occurred on the "Proposal to Request the Government to Appropriately Solve the Tuition Fees of Private Middle Schools," with repeated speeches. Finally, it was revised and passed: The tuition fee issue of private middle schools should be resolved through consultation between the school authorities and student representatives. If there is a dispute, the Municipal Education Bureau should participate in mediation.
