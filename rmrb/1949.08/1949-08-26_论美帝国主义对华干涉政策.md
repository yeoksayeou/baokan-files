　　On the U.S. Imperialist Policy of Interference in China
    Fu Ying
    After helplessly acknowledging the complete failure of its China aggression policy in the "White Paper," U.S. imperialism, in "Acheson's Letter to Truman," declared that it would oppose the Chinese people to the end, and that it would now and in the future encourage so-called "democratic individualists" to overthrow the Chinese people's regime.
    Shamelessly, U.S. imperialism proclaims that its present and future policy of aggression, interfering in China's internal affairs, is based on respect for the United Nations Charter. Search the UN Charter, and there is no article that can serve as the basis for the United States to interfere in China's internal affairs. On the contrary, the U.S. interference in China's internal affairs violates the United Nations Charter.
    Look! Article 1, Section 2 of Chapter 1 of the United Nations Charter clearly stipulates that the purpose of the United Nations is to "develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples." Article 2, Section 1 of Chapter 1 stipulates that "the Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members," and Section 4 stipulates that "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations."
    China is a member of the United Nations, and is also a founding country together with the United States. Therefore, according to the United Nations Charter, China and the United States are sovereign equals. In other words, China is a fully sovereign country, and the United States cannot interfere in China's internal affairs. The U.S. interference in China's internal affairs violates the United Nations Charter! It undermines the "principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples"! It is unfriendly to China!
    The people of a fully sovereign independent country naturally have the right to choose their own government and their own system. No one can deny the sacred right of the people of an independent sovereign country. The U.S. government also recognized this right to national self-determination in the "Atlantic Charter." In black and white, the "Atlantic Charter" clearly states: "They respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them."
    Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang's fascist reactionary government has been abandoned by the Chinese people. This is a cold fact that U.S. imperialism cannot deny. Acheson confessed: The Kuomintang "lost the vitality and revolutionary enthusiasm that originally built the Kuomintang." "The government and the Kuomintang have lost the crusading spirit that won the support of the people in the early days of the war of resistance. … They have degenerated into corruption, vying for position and power, relying on the United States to … maintain their dominance in the country. … The Chinese people are increasingly losing confidence in the government." "After the war, the Kuomintang was weakened, its discipline deteriorated, and it lost the hearts of the people. The behavior of the Kuomintang civil and military officials in the recovered areas has caused the Kuomintang to quickly lose the people's support and their prestige." "The facts prove that the Kuomintang leaders are not capable of dealing with their current crisis, their army has lost its fighting spirit, and their government has lost the support of the people." In short: The Kuomintang government is corrupt and opposed by the people.
    In fact, the Kuomintang has long been abandoned by the Chinese people since its betrayal of the revolution in 1927. In order to unite the whole country against Japan, the Chinese people once gave the Kuomintang a chance to repent and redeem itself. However, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang passively resisted Japan, actively opposed the people, and acted perversely, doing all kinds of evil. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people once again gave the Kuomintang a chance to atone for its sins for the sake of peaceful nation-building. The Kuomintang mistakenly took the people's magnanimity as weakness and dared to sell out national sovereignty in exchange for U.S. aid in order to launch a full-scale anti-people war. The Chinese people have done their best and cannot tolerate it any longer. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, they have carried out the People's Liberation War. After more than three years of hard work, they have basically eliminated the armed forces of the Chiang bandits. The Kuomintang reactionary regime has collapsed completely, and the Chinese people will soon establish a democratic coalition government of the People's Republic of China. This is how the Chinese people exercise their "right to freely determine the form of government under which they will live." The Chinese people decide their own affairs and choose their own government and system - this is the concrete content of sovereignty, this is the concrete content of independence, this is the concrete content of self-determination.
    U.S. imperialism, on the one hand, is forced to admit that the corrupt Kuomintang government has lost the support of the Chinese people due to the cold facts; on the other hand, it is doing its best to assist it in opposing the Chinese people. Acheson confessed: During the War of Resistance Against Japan, "Some American observers, in addition to being concerned about the impact of this decline of the Chinese central government on the war, were also concerned that the Kuomintang's decline would inevitably affect its final political or military struggle with the CCP. As early as 1943 and 1944, they were worried that the National Government might alienate itself from the Chinese people to such an extent that it would prove incapable of maintaining its power in the post-war struggle for power. Nevertheless, for obvious reasons, we continued to devote all our efforts to assisting the National Government." "What we have been trying to promote from 1945 to 1949" is "to assist the National Government to establish its authority in as large an area of China as possible." "From 1945 until the early autumn of 1948, the National Government had a significant advantage over its opponents in terms of manpower and military equipment. Indeed, during that period, largely due to our assistance in transporting, arming, and supplying their troops, they were able to extend their control over most of North China and Northeast China." "Since the victory over Japan, the total amount of aid given by the U.S. government to China under the rule of the National Government in the form of grants and loans has been approximately US$2 billion. This figure is worth more than 50% of the Chinese government's monetary expenditure. In terms of its relationship to the government's budget, U.S. aid to China is proportionally greater than the amount of aid the U.S. has given to any other country after the war. In addition to these grants and loans, the U.S. government has sold a large amount of wartime surplus materials, both military and civilian, to the Chinese government, with a total sales price of more than US$1 billion, while the U.S. government only obtained US$232.2 million through agreed valuation methods." In short: U.S. imperialism has done its best to assist the corrupt Kuomintang government that the Chinese people oppose.
    If it were not for the assistance of U.S. imperialism, the Chinese people would have overthrown the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's reactionary government long ago. In other words, the only reason it can exist today is because U.S. imperialism supports it. Since China is an independent sovereign country, the Chinese people have complete freedom to choose their government. They have the right to overthrow the government they have already abandoned and establish a new government they support at any time. This is entirely China's own business and cannot be interfered with by other countries. U.S. imperialism supports the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's reactionary government that has been abandoned by the Chinese people. This is interference in China's internal affairs, this is infringement of China's sovereignty, and this is a violation of the United Nations Charter!
    U.S. imperialism cannot conceal the fact that it is interfering in China's internal affairs. Acheson admitted: "Nothing that the United States has ever done or could do within the limits of its reasonable ability can change this result. What the United States has not done has no impact on this result. This is a product of internal forces in China, forces that the United States has also tried to influence, but has not been able to do effectively."
    U.S. imperialism argued strongly: "The National Government is a recognized government of a friendly country. Our friendship and our rights under international law require us to provide assistance to the National Government, not to the Communist Party, which is trying to undermine and overthrow this government." (Acheson's letter to Truman) This statement is not worth refuting. One of the most basic principles of international law is to respect the sovereignty and independence of other countries, not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, to remain neutral in the domestic wars of other countries, and to let the people of other countries solve their own problems. When the National Government has obviously lost the support of the Chinese people, and the Communist Party of China is leading the vast majority of the country to rise up and overthrow this government, according to international law, the United States does not have the "right" to assist the "National Government" that has been abandoned by the Chinese people. On the contrary, the United States only has the obligation to maintain neutrality! All revolutions are the people rising up to overthrow the original old government. If it is said that when a revolution occurs in a country, other countries have the right to assist the recognized original government, this is the reactionary proposition of the "Holy Alliance" in the early days of the bourgeois revolution, which is contrary to the basic principles of modern international law!
    When the government of a country has proven to be abandoned by the people of that country, it has lost its legitimacy. Any government that is supported by the people is a legitimate government; conversely, any government that is abandoned by the people is an illegitimate government. International recognition is the result of the legitimacy of the government, not the cause of legitimacy. Foreign countries can only recognize the government that has gained the support of its own people. If a foreign country recognizes and assists a government that is abandoned by its own people, it is already interfering in internal affairs. Once the old government loses the support of its own people and can only rely on the recognition and assistance of foreign countries to maintain its existence, then it is no longer a legitimate government of its own country, but a puppet government of a foreign country. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's reactionary government is such a foreign puppet government that has been abandoned by the Chinese people. U.S. imperialism supports the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's reactionary government with all its strength, making it a puppet of the United States, making China practically a colony of the United States. This is not only obviously an interference in internal affairs, but a naked aggression!
    After the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's reactionary government has been basically overthrown by the Chinese people, U.S. imperialism has not abandoned its policy of aggression by interfering in China's internal affairs, but is determined to continue to oppose the Chinese people to the end. The big running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is dying. As the dead dog is about to be thrown into the trash can, U.S. imperialism has taken a fancy to the "democratic individualists," wants to buy them off, and vainly attempts to use them to oppose the Chinese people's new democratic regime in order to continue its policy of aggression by interfering in China's internal affairs.
    This policy of aggression by U.S. imperialism of interfering in China's internal affairs has been, is, and will be a violation of the United Nations Charter, a violation of the Atlantic Charter, and a violation of the basic principles of international law.
    U.S. imperialism originally did not intend to abide by its international treaty obligations. It only uses international treaties such as the United Nations Charter to cover up its aggression that cannot be seen in the light. Now that this mask has been torn off, the Chinese people can see its vicious true shape more clearly.

　　论美帝国主义对华干涉政策
    福英
    美帝国主义在“白皮书”中无可奈何地承认其对华侵略政策底全部失败之后，复于“艾奇逊致杜鲁门信”中宣布它将与中国人民作对到底，宣布它现在和将来将鼓励所谓“民主个人主义者”来推翻中国人民政权。
    无耻地，美帝国主义宣称它现在和将来的这种干涉中国内政的侵略主义的政策，是以尊重联合国宪章为基础。找遍联合国宪章，没有任何条文可作为美国干涉中国内政的根据。正相反地，美国干涉中国内政是违背了联合国宪章。
    看吧！联合国宪章底第一章第一条第二项明确地规定，联合国底目的，是在于“发展国际间以尊重各民族底平等权利与自决之原则为基础的友好关系”。第一章第二条第一项规定“本组织以一切会员国底主权平等之原则为基础”，第四项规定“一切会员国在其国际关系上，不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国家底领土完整或政治独立。”
    中国是联合国组织底会员国，而且与美国同是发起国。因此，按联合国宪章规定，中国与美国是主权平等的。换一句话说，中国是一个完全主权国，美国不能干涉中国底内政。美国干涉中国底内政，就是违背了联合国宪章！就是破坏了“尊重各民族底平等权利与自决之原则”！就是对中国不友好！
    一个完全主权的独立国，它的人民当然有权力选择自己的政府、自己的制度。谁都不能否认独立主权国底人民底这种神圣的权利。美国政府在“大西洋宪章”中，也曾经承认这种民族自决权。白纸黑字，“大西洋宪章”明明写着：“尊重各民族自由决定其所赖以生存之政府形式之权利，各民族中此项权利有横遭剥夺者，两国俱欲使其恢复原有主权与自主政府。”
    蒋介石匪帮底法西斯的反动政府，已见弃于中国人民。这是美帝国主义所没法否认的冷酷的事实。艾奇逊不打自招地承认：国民党“丧失了当初把国民党建立起来的那种活力和革命热情”。“政府与国民党已丧失了他们在抗战初期赢得人民之拥护的那种十字军精神。……他们已经堕落于腐败、争夺地位和权利、依赖美国来……保持他们在国内的优势。……中国民众日益丧失对于政府的信心。”“国民党在战后，力量业已削弱，风纪颓败，且已失民心。国民党文武官员在收复区中的举止，已使国民党迅速地丧失了人民对他们的支持和他们的声望。”“事实证明国民党底领袖们没有能力对付其当前的危机，其军队已经丧失了斗志，其政府已经失去了人民的支持。”总括一句话：国民党政府是腐败的，人民所反对的。
    其实，国民党自一九二七年背叛了革命以来，早已为中国人民所弃。为了全国一致抗日，中国人民曾经给予国民党悔过自赎的机会。怎奈国民党在抗战时期，消极抗战，积极反人民，倒行逆施，无恶不为。抗战胜利之后，中国人民为了和平建国，再度给予国民党赎罪的机会。国民党竟误以人民底宽大为可欺，胆敢出卖国家主权，换取美援，以发动全面的反人民的战争。中国人民已仁至义尽，忍无可忍，在中国共产党领导之下，进行人民解放战争，经过了三年多的坚苦努力，基本上消灭了蒋匪底武装力量，国民党反动政权已全面崩溃，而中国人民很快就将建立中华人民民主共和国的民主联合政府。这就是中国人民如何实行其“自由决定其赖以生存之政府形式之权利”。中国人民自己决定中国自己的事情，选择自己的政府，选择自己的制度，——这就是主权底具体内容，这就是独立底具体内容，这就是自决底具体内容。
    美帝国主义一面迫于冷酷的事实而不得不承认腐败的国民党政府已失去中国人民底支持；一面却又倾全力援助它来与中国人民作对。艾奇逊自供道：在抗战时期，“若干美国观察家除了关切中国中央政府这种颓势对作战的影响外，他们还关切国民党底这种每况愈下，势必影响到它的最后与中共的政治或军事的斗争。他们在一九四三年及一九四四年便已担心国民政府可能如此自绝于国人，以致在战后争夺政权时，证明它竟无能力保持其权力。尽管如此，我们为了显见的理由，仍旧继续倾全力援助国民政府。”“我们从一九四五年到一九四九年所力予推行的，”“是协助国民政府尽可能在中国广大的地区上建立它的威权。”“从一九四五年一直到一九四八年初秋，国民政府在人力和军备上较其对手具有显著的优势。的确，在那一时期之内，大部分由于我们在运输、武装、和补给上给予他们的部队的援助，他们遂能推广其控制及于华北和东北的大部分。”“自从对日胜利后，美国政府以赠予和借贷的方式给予国民政府统治下的中国的援助总数约达二十亿美元，这个数字在价值上等于中国政府金钱支出底百分之五十以上。就其与该政府底预算之关系来看，美国对中国的援助，比例地较战后美国对其他任何国家的援助数量为大。除这些赠予和贷借外，美国政府曾以大量的军用与民用之战时剩余物资卖给中国政府，其卖价总值在十亿美元以上，而通过协议的估价办法，美国政府仅取得二亿三千二百万美元。”总括一句话：美帝国主义倾全力援助了中国人民所反对的腐败的国民党政府。
    蒋介石匪帮反动政府，如果没有美帝国主义底援助，中国人民早已把它推翻了。换一句话说，它之所以能存在至今日，其唯一的原因，就是因为美帝国主义支持它。中国既是一个独立的主权国，中国人民有完全自由可选择其政府，他们有权随时推翻他们所已唾弃的政府，成立他们所拥护的新政府。这完全是中国自己的事，非别国所能过问。美帝国主义支持已遭中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石匪帮反动政府，这就是干涉中国内政，这就是侵害中国主权，这就是违背联合国宪章！
    美帝国主义并不能掩蔽其干涉中国内政之事实。艾奇逊承认说：“美国在她能力合理限度以内，所曾经做过或能够做的，都不能改变这个结果。美国所未做的对于这个结果也没有影响。这是中国内部势力的产品，这些势力，美国亦曾试图加以影响，但不能有效。”
    美帝国主义强辩说：“国民政府是一个友邦底被承认的政府。我们的友谊以及我们在国际法上的权利，要我们以援助给予国民政府，而不给予企图破坏与推翻此一政府的共产党。”（艾奇逊致杜鲁门信）这种说法是不值一驳的。国际法底最基本的原则之一，就是尊重别国底主权、独立，不得干涉别国底内政，对别国底国内战争应该保守中立，别国底事情应该让它的人民自己去解决。当国民政府显然已丧失中国人民底拥护，而中国共产党领导着全国广大民众起来推翻此一政府时，按照国际公法，美国并没有援助这个已遭中国人民所唾弃的“国民政府”之“权利”。正相反地，美国是只有保守中立之义务！一切革命，就是人民起来推翻原有的旧政府。如果说，当一国发生革命时，他国有援助那被承认的原有的政府之权利，这是在资产阶级革命初期时“神圣同盟”底反动主张，与现代国际法底基本原则是相违背的！
    当一国底政府，已证明被该国人民所唾弃时，它已丧失其合法性。任何政府，为人民所拥护的，就是合法的政府，反之，为人民所唾弃的，就是不合法的政府。国际的承认，是政府底合法性的结果，而决不是合法性的原因。外国只能承认那获得本国人民拥护的政府。如果外国承认和援助那个为本国人民所唾弃的政府，就已是干涉内政。旧政府一丧失本国人民底拥护，只有依靠外国底承认外国底援助才能保持其存在，那末，它已不是本国合法政府，而是外国傀儡政府了。蒋介石匪帮反动政府，就是这样的一个已被中国人民唾弃的外国傀儡政府。美帝国主义以全力支持蒋介石匪帮反动政府，作为美国底傀儡，使中国实际成为美国底殖民地，这不仅显然是干涉内政，而是赤裸裸的侵略了！
    在蒋介石匪帮反动政府已被中国人民所基本打倒之后，美帝国主义并没有放弃其对华干涉内政的侵略主义的政策，而是坚决要继续与中国人民作对到底。大走狗蒋介石匪帮已奄奄一息，在死狗行将被丢入垃圾筒的当儿，美帝国主义已看中了“民主个人主义者”，要收买他们，妄图利用他们，来反对中国新民主主义的人民政权，以继续其干涉中国内政的侵略主义的政策。
    美帝国主义底这种干涉中国内政的侵略主义的政策，过去是、现在是、将来也是违背联合国宪章，违背大西洋宪章，违背国际法基本原则。
    美帝国主义本来并不打算遵守其国际条约底义务，它只是以国际条约如联合国宪章之类来掩蔽其不能见天日的侵略主义的勾当。现在把这假面具撕破，使中国人民能够更看清楚它底凶恶的真形。
