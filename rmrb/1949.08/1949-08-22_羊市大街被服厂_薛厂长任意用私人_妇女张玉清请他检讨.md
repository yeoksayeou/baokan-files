Yangshi Street Clothing Factory
　　Factory Director Xue Arbitrarily Hires People Through Favoritism
　　Woman Zhang Yuqing Asks Him to Make a Self-Criticism

　　Editor: I am from Wanping District 7. Because my family's land was flooded, I recently came to live with relatives and friends in Pingnei District 4. With a letter of introduction from the Tongxian Special District, I asked the Fourth District of Beijing to introduce me to work in a clothing factory. The Fourth District Government introduced me to the Yangshi Street Clothing Factory in Neisi District to apply for a job. I went to register on the 12th, and the factory staff said, "You can come tomorrow for the exam at 6:00 AM." On the 13th, I went to wait in front of the factory at 5:30 AM. At 6:30 AM, the factory guard said that Factory Director Xue had not yet gotten up. At 7:00 AM, Factory Director Xue finally came out and said to the dozens of women who were applying, "Now that we have enough people, we are no longer testing." Everyone said, "Why did you tell us to come today yesterday?" Mr. Xue said, "Who said that yesterday? I don't know. No one else is in charge of this factory except me. You can all go home." However, at that time, several women who had neither letters of introduction nor certificates were led by people from inside the factory, nodded to Mr. Xue, and went inside. I asked him, "What is the reason for this?" He said, "That is the reason. Do what you want!" What could I do? Later, I saw him whispering to a few people, telling them to wait a moment, so I also waited on the side. After he had driven everyone else away, he began to register his own dozen or so people. Because I hadn't left, he had no choice but to write down "come tomorrow" for me. On the 15th, I arrived before 6:00 AM and entered the factory to take the test. A comrade working in the factory examined my work and said, "You are doing very well, just keep doing it like this." Before a set of cotton military uniforms was finished, Mr. Xue came again and asked everyone, "Who has the badge I gave out yesterday?" As a result, only six people got the badge through friends from Factory Director Xue. These people with badges were hired, and the other forty or so people were driven away. The above is truly something I have never seen before! Please let everyone judge this and ask Factory Director Xue to examine his own work style and thinking!
　　I am willing to bear legal responsibility if the above situation is not true.
　　Furthermore, I would like to ask your newspaper to introduce me to a sewing job if possible!
　　Woman Zhang Yuqing

　　羊市大街被服厂
  　薛厂长任意用私人
  　妇女张玉清请他检讨
    编辑同志：我是宛平七区人。因为家中地被水淹了，最近来平内四区亲友家居住，经通县专区来函证明，请北平市第四区介绍到被服厂工作。第四区政府介绍我到内四区羊市大街被服厂投考。十二日去报名，该厂人员说：“你可以明天来，上午六时考试”。十三日五点半我即去该厂门前等候。至六时半，该厂警卫声言薛厂长尚未起床。至七时，薛厂长才出来，对几十个投考的妇女说，现在人已取齐，不再考试了。大家说，为什么昨天让我们今天来呢？薛某说：“昨天谁说的？我不知道，我这工厂并无第二人负责，你们回去吧。”可是当时却有几个既没有介绍信，也没有证明书的妇女由厂内的人引导，向薛某点点头就进去了。我问他：“这是什么理由”？他说：“就是这个理由，你看着办吧！”我有什么办法呢？后来我见他向几个人耳语，让他们等一等，于是我也在一边等起来。等到他把人都撵走后，又开始登记他自己的那十几个人，可是我并没走，他无法遂给我记上明天来的字样，十五日，我在六点前赶到，进厂考试，该厂一工作同志验看了说：“你做的很好，就这样做吧。”在一套棉军装没有做完的时候，薛某又来了，问大家道：“谁有我昨天给的牌子？”结果只有六个人通过朋友从薛厂长那里得到了牌子。这些有牌子的人被考上了，其余四十多人被赶走了。以上真是我第一次见到的事！请大家评判一下，并请薛厂长检讨一下自己是什么作风，什么思想！
    以上情形如不确实，我愿负法律上的责任。
    再者，并请贵报可能时，给我介绍一种缝纫工作！  妇女张玉清
