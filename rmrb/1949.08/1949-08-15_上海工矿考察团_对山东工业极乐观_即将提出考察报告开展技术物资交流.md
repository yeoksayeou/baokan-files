The group felt greatly excited about Shandong's rich industrial resources and the bright prospects for Shandong's future industrial construction. Some members expressed their willingness to participate in Shandong Province's construction work. The group raised many suggestions for improvement regarding the unified use of electricity in Shandong, expanding power generation, improving existing heavy industrial production equipment, and training technical personnel. Before leaving, the Shandong Provincial People's Government held a symposium and banquet to see them off.

With the guarantee of the great united strength of the people, the victory of Shandong's industrial construction is entirely certain.
