The North China People's Government Protects National Industry
　　Re-Issuing Shijiazhuang Daxing Yarn Factory
　　Government and Capital Representatives are Negotiating Handover

　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Shijiazhuang Daxing Yarn Factory, formerly taken over by the People's Government for restoration and operation, has now been clearly identified as private capital. The North China People's Government has decided to return it.
　　The Shijiazhuang Daxing Yarn Factory originally belonged to the Hankou Daxing Textile Co., Ltd., and was established in 1923 by private shareholding with a capital of three million yuan. At that time, it had 25,000 spindles. Later, it continued to add equipment to expand production, increasing the number of spindles to 30,000, adding 500 looms and 8 blanket machines, with a total of more than 2,300 workers. After the "September 18th" Incident, when the Northeast fell, and the Kuomintang government signed the Tanggu Truce, the national industry suffered increasingly from the economic pressure of Japanese imperialism, and the factory also showed signs of recession. After the outbreak of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, Shijiazhuang was occupied, and the factory was hijacked by the Japanese enemy, who dismantled two-thirds of the spindles for "iron offering." By the time of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the factory was recovered and put into operation by the capital side. However, due to the Kuomintang government's launch of the anti-people civil war, the aggression of imperialism was not eliminated, and the oppression of bureaucratic capital was even more severe, the national industry was on the verge of bankruptcy. Therefore, at that time, the factory only operated more than 11,000 spindles, 300 looms, and 6 blanket machines, with more than 1,500 employees, barely maintaining operations.

　　People's Government Takes Over Operation, Restoring Old Appearance After Liberation
　　In November 1947, Shijiazhuang was liberated by us. At that time, the person in charge fled, no one was responsible, the nature of the capital was vague, and the situation of the shareholders was unclear. Therefore, in order to maintain the lives of the workers and protect the industrial foundation, the People's Government took it over and appointed Comrade Huo Ran as the factory director to prepare for resumption of work. In order to destroy the economic construction of the liberated areas and stifle the lives of the workers, the Kuomintang enemy planes bombed the factory in turns for more than ten days. The factory buildings collapsed, the machines flew around, and the one million square meters of the factory site became a sea of smoke and fire. At that time, Factory Director Huo Ran led dozens of cadres, separately organized worker rescue teams, jumped into the yarn factory, endured the heat of the steel, and did not avoid the collapse of high walls and dangerous buildings, fighting the raging fire with buckets of water and risking their lives to rescue. Under the heroic and resourceful actions of the workers, and with the assistance of the farmer transport teams, most of the machinery and equipment were transported out. However, the machine rooms and warehouses became ruins, resulting in the unemployment of more than 1,500 workers, and the lives of about 20,000 family members and vendors who often depended on the factory for food were threatened. The People's Government believed that the only way to solve the workers' problems was to restore and develop production, and decided to rebuild the Daxing Yarn Factory in a decentralized manner. At that time, there was an enemy blockade outside and no large machine manufacturing inside, and the renovation project faced great difficulties. However, with the strong support of the People's Government, after the cadres and party members mobilized the workers, contributed materials, and inspired the wisdom and creativity of the workers to manufacture parts themselves and research substitutes, they finally overcame the material difficulties. For example, the use of Japanese melton cloth to replace the English-made leather roller core felt played a decisive role in the rapid start of the yarn factory. During the renovation process, engineers and workers united and worked together, and all machine tools were quenched to restore hardness. After two months of efforts, they strove for partial start-up. Immediately after, they carried out factory construction while producing, and carried out renovation. In the past year, a total of 140,000 various parts were manufactured, and the machines were gradually repaired and completed. By May 1949, more than 11,872 spindles, 220 looms, and 6 blanket machines had been put into operation, basically restoring the old appearance.

　　Established a Democratic Management System, Workers Actively Produced, Quality Improved Unprecedentedly
　　At the same time, the factory workers organized fire brigades and patrol teams and carried out factory protection struggles under the circumstances of sabotage by Kuomintang agents and frequent harassment by airplanes. Especially last autumn, when the Kuomintang bandit army attempted to raid Shijiazhuang, the factory workers responded to the government's call to evacuate machinery and materials and transfer them. Enemy planes circled and dropped bombs, and the workers guarded the machines day and night, never leaving a step. When the machines were transported back, they were immediately installed and resumed work. Then, they responded to the call for increased production. Under the leadership of Communist Party members, Youth League members, and production activists, the entire factory workers invested in the Red Flag competition movement, increased output, improved quality, and saved raw materials, pushing production forward. Many production heroes and models emerged, red flags were planted all over the factory, and production enthusiasm has been high. Up to now, the factory produces 13,000 pounds of yarn per day (24 hours), 450 pieces of cloth per day (20 hours), and 145 military blankets per day (10 hours). The quality of Shannu cloth is the highest, breaking the unprecedented quality standard of Daxing, and fine yarn and military blankets have also exceeded the pre-liberation standards. The reason why the factory has achieved such rapid recovery and development is mainly due to the workers' acquisition of master status and democratic life politically, the implementation of political education and cultural learning, and the establishment of a factory management committee to further protect the democratic rights of the workers. Economically, wages were adjusted to ensure the basic livelihood of the workers, and various welfare undertakings were promoted, such as the establishment of cooperatives, the implementation of 20% off sales, the establishment of workers' children's schools, the establishment of workers' medical centers, and the operation of sideline production, so that workers' lives were gradually improved, thereby stimulating workers' production enthusiasm and improving production efficiency.

　　Investigation Confirms Private Capital, Government Firmly Returns All
　　On the eve of the liberation of Hankou, the board of directors of Daxing Textile Co., Ltd. saw the declaration of the People's Liberation Army and had a preliminary understanding of the industrial policy of the People's Government. Immediately, Tao Zhinong was sent as a representative, carrying a list of shareholders and various documents, and submitted a document to the North China People's Government, requesting the return of the Shijiazhuang Daxing Yarn Factory. At the same time, according to the results of the investigation, the government believed that the factory was indeed private capital. In order to implement the industrial policy, it was decided to return the Shijiazhuang Daxing Yarn Factory of the company in its original form, and appointed Huo Ran, the current director of the Daxing Yarn Factory, as the government representative to negotiate with the capital representative in accordance with the principle of fairness and reasonableness so that it could continue to operate and develop its business. From August 3rd to 16th, after many consultations, a common opinion has been reached. The main contents are: In accordance with the government's decision, all assets of the former Daxing Yarn Factory allocated by the former Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Government Enemy and Puppet Materials Clearing Committee, based on the property catalog of the accounting department when the current Daxing Yarn Factory was taken over, will be returned together with the power plant. After the return, Daxing Company is willing to carry out self-operation in accordance with the government's policy of developing a planned economy. However, at the beginning of the takeover, due to insufficient funds, it is still willing to weave for the government trade authorities. As for all the operating profits and losses and internal and external debts during the government's takeover period, the Public Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government will be responsible for handling them. All factory repairs, tool additions, opening and transfer, wages paid to employees during liberation, and employee welfare fund advances will be repaid to the government by Daxing Company at the then-current millet conversion rate. The machines and houses borrowed by the government from Daxing Company will also be depreciated by the government on a monthly basis and delivered to the capital side. The existing inventory of materials and equipment in the factory will be priced at market prices and sold to Daxing Company. If Daxing Company considers it unnecessary or the price is not suitable, it can refuse. Regarding the handling of labor-capital relations, everything will be implemented in accordance with the government's guidance, and the factory rules will still be handled in accordance with the regulations during the government's takeover period. Finally, it is tentatively agreed that September 1st of this year will be the handover date. If the capital side encounters difficulties due to insufficient funds and inconvenient transportation at that time, it can apply to the government for postponement of the handover. The above-mentioned opinions have been drafted into meeting minutes and signed by both representatives to show their responsibility. As for the transfer contract of Daxing Yarn Factory, it will be formally signed in the near future.

　　华北人民政府保护民族工业
  　发还石市大兴纱厂
    政府与资方代表正协商移交
    【本报讯】前为人民政府接管恢复经营之石家庄大兴纱厂，现经查明确为私人资本，华北人民政府决定予以发还。
    石市大兴纱厂，原属汉口大兴纺织股份有限公司，于一九二三年由私人集股创设，当时资金三百万，置有纱锭二万五千枚，俟后继续增添设备扩大生产，纱锭增至三万枚，添设布机五百台，毯机八台，全厂工人达到二千三百余名。“九一八”东北沦陷，国民党政府复签订塘沽卖国协定，民族工业受日本帝国主义经济势力之压迫日甚，该厂亦遂呈不景气现象。“七七”抗日战争爆发，石市沦陷，该厂遂为日敌劫持，并拆毁纱锭三分之二作为“献铁”之用。至抗日战争胜利，该厂为资方收回开工，惟因国民党政府发动反人民内战，外则帝国主义侵略未除，内则官僚资本欺压益甚，民族工业濒于破产，故该厂当时仅开纱锭一万一千余枚，布机三百台，毯机六台，职工一千五百余名，勉强维持。
    人民政府接管经营　解放以后得复旧观
    一九四七年十一月，石家庄为我解放。当时主持人逃匿，无人负责，资本性质模糊，股东情况不明，故人民政府为了维护工人生活，保护工业基础，遂予接管，并委派霍然同志为该厂厂长，准备复工。国民党为破坏解放区经济建设，窒息工人生活，该厂遭敌机轮番轰炸达十余日，厂房崩裂，机器横飞，一百万方米的厂址变成了烟火之海。当时霍然厂长带领十数干部，分头组织工人抢救队，跳进纱厂，忍耐住钢铁的灼热，不避高墙危厦的倾压，用桶水和烈烟搏斗，进行冒死抢救。在工人英勇机智的行动下，在农但大车运输队的协助下，机器设备大部运出，民均已变成了残骨断骸，机房仓库变为废墟，遂使一千五百余职工陷于失业，经常依靠该厂吃饭的工人家属、小贩，约有两万人的生活受到了威胁。人民政府认为只有从恢复发展生产中解决工人问题，遂决定采取分散方式重建大兴纱厂。在当时外有敌人封锁，内无大的机器制造，装修工程面临极大困难。但在人民政府大力支持下，经过干部当员动员工人，献交器材，启发工人智慧创造，自制零件，研究代用品，终于克服了器材困难，例如用日本大衣呢代替了英国特制的皮辊呢心呢，对纱厂的迅速开工曾起了决定作用。在装修过程中，工程师和工人团结一致，一齐动手，全部机床均经沾火恢复硬度，经过两月努力，争取了部分开工。遂即在生产中一面进行建厂，一面进行装修，一年来共制各种机件十四万件，陆续将机器修配完整，至一九四九年五月已实开纱锭一万一千八百七十二枚，布机二百二十台，毯机六台基本上恢复了旧观。
    建立了民主管理制度　职工积极生产　质量空前提高
    同时该厂职工在国民党特务时伺破坏，飞机经常骚扰情况下，组织了防火队，纠察队，进行了护厂斗争。尤其在去秋国民党匪军企图奔袭石家庄之际，该厂职工响应政府号召，疏散机器物资，进行转移，敌机盘旋投弹，工人昼夜看守机器，始终不离一步。机器运回来，立即按装复工。接着即又响应增产号召，全厂工人在共产党员、青年团员、生产积极分子带头影响下，投入了红旗竞赛运动，增加了产量，提高了质量，节省了原料，将生产向前推进了一步，出现了许多的生产英雄模范，红旗插遍全厂，生产情绪一直高涨。至目前止，该厂产纱每日（二十四小时）一万三千磅，产布每日（二十小时）四百五十匹，军毯每日（十小时）一百四十五条，其质量以山鹿布最高，已打破大兴之空前质量标准，细纱军毯亦均超过解放前之标准。该厂所以获得如此迅速之恢复发展，主要是由于工人在政治上获得了主人地位与民主生活，进行了政治教育与文化学习，建立工厂管理委员会，进一步保障了工人民主权利。在经济上进行了调整工资，使工人生活获得了基本保障，推行了各种福利事业，如成立合作社，实行八折配卖，建立工人子弟学校，设立工人医疗所，经营副业生产，使工人生活获得逐步改善，因此发挥了工人生产积极性，提高了生产效率。
    调查确属私人资本　政府坚决全部发还
    汉口解放前夕，大兴纺织股份有限公司董事会，见到人民解放军宣言，初步了解人民政府工业政策。遂即派陶稚农为代表，携带股东名单，以及各种证件，备文呈请华北人民政府，请求发还石家庄大兴纱厂。同时政府亦根据调查结果，认为该厂确为私人资本，为贯彻执行工业政策，决定将该公司之石家庄大兴纱厂原物发还，并委派现大兴纱厂厂长霍然为政府代表，与资方代表根据公平合理使其能继续经营与发展业务之方针进行商谈。自八月三日至十六日止，经多次磋商，已获得共同意见，其主要内容为：遵照政府决定，将前晋察冀边区政府敌伪物资清理委员会，拨交前大兴纱厂之全部资产，以现大兴纱厂接管时之会计科财产目录为凭，连同发电厂一并发还。发还后，大兴公司愿遵照政府发展计划经济之政策，进行自营。但在接办之初，因资金不足，仍愿为政府贸易机关代为纺织。至于在政府接管期间，一切经营盈亏内该外欠，均由华北人民政府公营企业部负责处理，其所有工厂修建，工具增设，开办转移，解放时垫付职工工资，职工福利基金垫款等费用，均按当时小米折实，由大兴公司偿还政府。政府所借用大兴公司之机器房屋，亦由政府按月以实物折旧交付资方。该厂现有库存物料器材，则均按市价作价，售与大兴公司，如大兴公司认为不需或价格不合宜时，可以不要。关于劳资关系之处理，一切遵照政府之指导施行，厂规仍按政府接管期间规定办法办理。最后并暂议于本年九月一日为移交日期，届时资方如因资金和交通不便时，可呈请政府延期交接。现已将上述意见拟出会谈纪录，并经双方代表签字以示负责。至于大兴纱厂之移交合同，不日即可正式签订。
