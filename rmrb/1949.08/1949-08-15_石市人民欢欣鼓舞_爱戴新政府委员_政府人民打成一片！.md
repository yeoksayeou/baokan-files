(From our Shijiazhuang special dispatch) People from all walks of life in Shijiazhuang are following the proceedings of the People's Representative Conference over the past 20 days with infinite enthusiasm. In particular, the election of 25 new government committee members, who were born and raised locally, have close ties with the broad masses, and are loved by them, has brought the people of all circles wild joy and cheerful encouragement.

Liu Chunhe, the deputy director of the Railway Machinery Factory (and also a representative), waited to see the vote count. As soon as he heard that Ji Gengshen, an old worker from the factory, had been elected, he immediately called back, and the whole factory burst into excitement. The trade union also immediately organized a Yangko dance team to go to the old worker's home to congratulate him. When the female workers of Daxing Textile Factory heard that female worker Yan Jinfen was elected, they all said: "With a female worker elected as a committee member, our lives will be guaranteed!" When the workers of the coking plant heard that their engineer Dai Xizhi was elected as a government committee member, they resolved to actively increase production to celebrate the victory of the Representative Conference. The Second District Committee went to the homes of the elected industrialists and businessmen to congratulate them. Shen Xili and Feng Yunzhang, who were elected as committee members, expressed that they would definitely develop industry and commerce well.

In the poorest place, after Ping Lian, a Hui Muslim from the Beggar's Courtyard, was elected, the entire Beggar's Courtyard was very happy. Some people said: "Our Beggar's Courtyard has a government committee member, which is not only a joyous event for the Hui people, but also for the Han people. In the future, the relationship between the Hui and Han people will be even closer!"

    石市人民欢欣鼓舞
    爱戴新政府委员
    政府人民打成一片！
    【本报石家庄专电】石市各阶层人民，以无限热忱关怀着二十天来人民代表大会的一举一动。特别二十五位土生土长，与广大群众有着密切联系，为广大群众所爱戴的新政府委员的选举，更带给各界人民以疯狂的喜悦和欢快的鼓舞。
    铁路机厂副厂长刘春和（也是代表）等着看开票，一听到该厂老工人计根生当选，马上打电话回去，于是全厂沸腾起来。工会也立刻组织了秧歌队赶到老工人家里去贺喜。大兴纱厂女工听到女工阎金芬当选，一齐说：“我们女工有人当选委员，我们生活就有保障了！”炼焦厂工人一听到他们的工程师戴锡祉当选政府委员，要积极生产来庆祝代表大会的胜利。二区区委到各当选工商业家家中去贺喜，申希礼、冯云章当选了委员，表示一定要好好发展工商业。
    最穷的地方，化子大院回民平连当选后，全化子大院都非常高兴。有人说：“咱们化子大院有了政府委员，不仅是回民的喜事，也是汉人的喜事，以后回汉的关系，更加亲密了！”
