    Beijing Film Studio
    Completes Newsreel No. 2
    Production of "Liberation of Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Wuhan" Underway
    [Report from this newspaper] Since its establishment after liberation, the main task of the Beijing Film Studio has been to produce newsreels. The first newsreel, "Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu Review Troops in Beijing," has been screened everywhere and has been warmly welcomed by audiences. Now, the second newsreel has also been completed, and its main contents include three items:
    In the "News Briefs," there are portrayals of workers' enthusiastic production, including Beijing railway workers repairing the "May 1st" locomotive, Tianjin Steel Plant repairing the Martin furnace, and the ordnance factory rushing to produce guns and ammunition to support the army's southward advance. In addition, there are also scenes from this year's Spring Women's Congress held in Beijing and welcoming the return of the peace delegates to Beijing.
    The second part consists of two combat documentaries, "Huaihai Campaign Report" and "Liberation of Taiyuan." These are precious shots taken by photographers at great personal risk while following the army in combat. The "Huaihai Campaign Report" is divided into three stages: annihilation of Huang Botao, Huang Wei, and Du Yuming, with exciting shots of killing Huang Botao and capturing Huang Wei and Du Yuming alive. In the "Liberation of Taiyuan" film, there are shots of capturing Wang Jingguo, Sun Chu, Dai Bingnan, and the Japanese soldier Iwata, who was retained by the Yan Xishan bandits.
    Finally, what is exciting is the film of the "Preparatory Committee for the New Political Consultative Conference Established." This is a valuable historical material for the birth of a new China. Twenty-three units, including the Communist Party of China, participated in this meeting. After Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, delivered the opening speech, Chairman Mao spoke, explaining the tasks of the preparatory committee. Then, Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, spoke. Representatives Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, and Chen Jiageng also spoke and were all captured on film. During the break in the meeting, Chairman Mao shook hands with the representatives. Before the opening of the meeting, the entire audience stood up and paid tribute to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, which was also filmed.
    In other news: The third production of the Beijing Film Studio, concerning the million-strong army crossing the Yangtze River to liberate Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, and Shanghai, is now in production and will soon be completed.
