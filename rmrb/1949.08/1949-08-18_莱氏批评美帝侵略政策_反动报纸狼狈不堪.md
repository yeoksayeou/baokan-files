Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: As the fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly approaches, the annual report on the work of the United Nations by Secretary-General Lie has attracted attention. According to a report by the Polish News Agency citing the Workers' News Agency, Lie undoubtedly criticized American foreign policy. Yes, his criticism was veiled and couched in diplomatic language, but when he warned in his report against damaging the prestige of the United Nations, against undermining the UN Charter, and against covenants that run counter to the Charter, he was referring to the United States. Lie's warning clearly contained criticism of the North Atlantic Treaty, which immediately aroused the anger of the bourgeois press. Unable to conceal their flustered and reactionary nature, these newspapers condemned Lie, saying he dared to suggest that the resolution of the Berlin issue reduced the psychological impact of war, that the success of the Security Council should be attributed to the principle of unanimity, that world economic problems could only be solved through the United Nations, and that lasting peace could only be achieved by abandoning covenants that exclude a major power (referring to the North Atlantic Treaty). The Workers' News Agency continued: It is difficult for the Marshall Plan countries of Western Europe to tolerate these criticisms of the policies of the imperialist camp and the affirmation of the correct policies of the democratic camp, especially when these words are spoken by such a high-ranking official as Lie. Therefore, they find it even more difficult to bear. However, the bourgeois newspapers could not find arguments to refute the Secretary-General's report, which is another proof of the weakness and powerlessness of the imperialist position. The policy of subservience to Washington pursued by the governments of the Marshall Plan countries is becoming increasingly discredited in Western European countries.

　　莱氏批评美帝侵略政策
  　反动报纸狼狈不堪
    【新华社北平十七日电】当此联合国第四届常会开幕的前夕，联合国秘书长莱氏关于联合国工作的常年报告，引起了人们的注意。据波兰通讯社引工人通讯社的报道称，无疑义的，莱氏批评了美国的外交政策。是的，他的批评是遮遮掩掩的，而且是用的外交词令，但是，当他在报告中警告不要损害联合国威信，不要破坏联合国宪草和警告与宪章背道而驰的公约时，他指的是美国。莱氏的警告中显然包含着对北大西洋公约的批评，这种批评立刻引起资产阶级报纸的愤怒。不能掩盖他们的狼狈的反动的报纸，于是就谴责莱氏，说他竟然敢讲柏林问题的解决减少了战争心理，安理会的成功应归功于一致原则，唯有通过联合国才能解决世界经济问题，以及放弃排除一个大国的公约（指北大西洋公约）。就能获得持久和平。工人通讯社继称：要西欧的马歇尔计划国家忍受这些谴责帝国主义阵营的政策，和确认民主阵营正确政策的话，是困难的，特别是这些话是由莱氏这样一个高级当局人物讲出来的，因此，他们更是难于忍受。可是，资产阶级报纸不能找到论据来反对这位秘书长的报告，这是帝国主义立场的软弱无力的又一证明。马歇尔计划国家的政府所遵循的对华盛顿奴颜婢膝的政策，在西欧国家中越来越威信扫地了。
