　　Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative and Northern Hebei Mountain Area
　　Sign Contract for Bartering Mountain Products
　　[This City News] The Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative has signed a contract with cooperatives in the mountain areas of northern Hebei to barter mountain products. Huairou and Miyun counties in northern Hebei are rich in mountain products such as peanuts, but lack grain. Every year during the lean months of June and July on the lunar calendar, the lives of farmers are very difficult. Before liberation, merchants took advantage of this to exploit farmers by ordering immature mountain products at low prices, causing great losses to local farmers. In view of this, the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative has signed a contract with cooperatives in various counties to exchange Northeast millet for mountain products. This not only solves the food problem for farmers but also reduces intermediate exploitation. The exchange rate is: 200 jin of millet (which can be milled into 130 jin of rice) for every 100 jin of peanuts, walnuts, or chestnuts, which is more than double the rate of 60 jin of rice for 100 jin of peanuts that merchants generally offer now. The cooperative has played a role in reducing intermediate exploitation. At the same time, because walnuts are an export commodity, to take care of the interests of farmers, if the market price exceeds the current fixed price by more than 50% when the walnuts mature, the exchange rate will increase by 60% of the price difference. The Municipal Cooperative has now begun transporting grain to various counties, exchanging 2 million jin of millet with Huairou and Miyun counties for peanuts, walnuts, chestnuts, firewood, and charcoal, and exchanging 180,000 jin of millet with Changping County for peanuts and walnuts.

　　市供销总社与平北山区
  　订换山货合同
    【本市讯】平市供销合作总社与平北山区各县合作社订立交换山货合同。平北山区怀柔、已化（密云）等县，盛产山货花生，粮食较少，每当阴历六、七月青黄不接时，农民生活很苦。解放前，商人则趁此剥削农民，以低价订购未成熟之山货，致使当地农民受到很大损失。平市供销合作总社有鉴于此，特与各县合作社订立合同，以东北谷子交换山货。这样，既解决了农民食粮的困难，又减少了中间剥削。交换率是：花生、核桃、栗子每百斤换谷子二百斤（能碾米一百三十斤），较现在一般商人以六十斤米换一百斤花生多一倍。合作社已起到减少中间剥削的作用。同时，又因核桃是出口货，为了照顾农民利益，如在核桃成熟时，市价超过现在定价的百分之五十以上，则交换率将增加价格差额的百分之六十。现市合作总社已开始往各县运粮，以二百万斤谷子和怀柔、已化两县交换花生、核桃、栗子、木柴、木炭，以十八万斤谷子和昌平县交换花生、核桃。
