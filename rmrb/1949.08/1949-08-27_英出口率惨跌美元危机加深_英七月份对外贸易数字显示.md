Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 26th: London dispatch: The British economic situation is further deteriorating. The British Board of Trade announced on the 22nd that the July foreign trade figures showed that Britain's daily export rate in July had plummeted to the lowest point since October last year. July is known as a peak export month, but the total export value was only 141.7 million pounds. The total value of British imports in July was only slightly lower than the historical record high in May and June, at 186.4 million pounds (including more than 4 million pounds of entrepot trade), similar to the average amount in the first quarter, but significantly higher than last year. The import surplus still remains at a high level of 40.5 million pounds, almost twice the average in the first quarter of this year. The measures announced by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Cripps, to stop using dollars to purchase goods for three months in order to alleviate the dollar deficit, have proven to be of little effect. The huge trade deficit is causing Britain's dollar and gold reserves to deplete rapidly. The New York Times and the London Financial Times have successively inferred that Britain's existing 406 million pounds of dollar and gold reserves will fall by another 100 million pounds in the third quarter, an increase of 25 million pounds compared to the second quarter. Cripps announced last month that Britain's current dollar deficit has reached 600 million pounds per year, and even if the Marshall Plan can provide Britain with an appropriation of 200 million pounds this year, all dollar and gold reserves will be used up within this year. The further deterioration of the dollar crisis caused by the current policies of the Labor government has caused serious panic in British financial circles. After the New York Times published the news that the pound would fall by 100 million pounds in the third quarter, British government securities, which had been falling continuously since the end of July to below the lowest point during World War II, fell again by 0.75 percent on the 19th.

　　英出口率惨跌美元危机加深
  　英七月份对外贸易数字显示
    【新华社北平二十六日电】伦敦讯：英国经济情况进一步恶化。英国商务部二十二日发表的七月份对外贸易数字，显示英国七月份的每日出口率已剧跌至去年十月以来的最低点。七月份素称出口旺月，但出口总值仅一亿四千一百七十万镑。七月份英国入口总值仅较五、六月份的历史最高纪录略低，为一亿八千六百四十万镑（其中包括转口货四百多万镑），与第一季平均量相仿，但比去年却大大超过。入超仍然停留在四千零五十万镑的高度，比今年第一季平均数几大一倍。英国财政大臣克里浦斯为减轻美元亏空而宣布停止使用美元购货三个月的措施，证明并不能起多大作用。如此巨额的贸易逆差所造成的美元赤字，正使英国的美元与黄金储备加速枯竭。纽约时报与伦敦金融时报先后推断：英国现有四亿零六百万镑的美元与黄金储备，第三季将再下跌一亿镑，比第二季下跌数增多二千五百万镑。克里浦斯上月曾宣布，英国目前美元亏空已达每年六亿镑的程度，纵令马歇尔计划本年度能予英国以二亿镑的拨款，全部美元黄金准备也将在本年度内用光。工党政府现行政策所造成的美元危机之进一步恶化，已在英国金融界引起严重的恐慌。在纽约时报发表英镑第三季将下跌一亿镑的消息以后，七月底以来即已连续剧跌至第二次世界大战时最低点以下的英国政府证券，十九日曾再度下跌百分之零点七五。
