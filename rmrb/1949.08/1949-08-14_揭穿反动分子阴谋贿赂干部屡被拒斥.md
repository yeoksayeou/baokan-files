    Expose the Reactionary Elements' Conspiracy to Bribe Cadres, Repeatedly Rejected
    [Our Newspaper] During the work of registering personnel from reactionary parties in Shijingshan District, extensive publicity and mobilization were carried out, and the masses actively reported and exposed reactionary party and league members. Reactionary party and league members felt it was difficult to hide, so they attempted to bribe our cadres to avoid registration. On the night of July 30th, the mother of Ma Guifu (Third Youth League squad leader) from Sanjiadian Village sent a jar of honey to village chief Wang Qinghai and Farmers' Association Director Zhang Yongxiang. The village chief immediately refused. The Farmers' Association Director sent the honey to the village government and held a mass meeting to expose the shameless conspiracy of the reactionary elements. The masses all said, "The bad guys don't repent and still try this trick!" The village cadres stated that they would never accept bribes from reactionaries and would thoroughly eliminate special agents. They ordered the old woman to take the honey back. Also, Li Hongkui (Third Youth League Eighth District Captain) from Wulituo said at the beginning of this registration that the government was too lenient towards him and he couldn't thank them enough, so he used a fountain pen to bribe the responsible personnel of our registration team, but was severely rejected. Afterwards, he asked Zhang Dexin (a squad leader under Li's command) who had just graduated from Revolutionary University and returned home, to say to the person in charge of the registration team: "Li Hongkui is really too embarrassed, please be lenient with him! Don't dig too deeply into his materials this time. We are preparing to get some gifts (People's Currency) for the section chief and the bureau chief to show our sincerity." Our responsible comrade immediately called Li Hongkui to the registration team. In addition to keeping him in the registration team for education and reflection, his tricks were exposed.

    揭穿反动分子阴谋贿赂干部屡被拒斥
    【本报讯】登记反动党派人员工作中，石景山区曾进行了广泛的宣传动员，群众纷纷检举和揭露反动党团分子，反动党团分子大感隐藏困难，乃图贿赂我干部，逃避登记。七月三十日深夜，三家店村马贵福（三青团分队长）的母亲给村长王庆海及农会主任张永祥各送去蜂蜜一罐。村长当即拒绝。农会主任把峰蜜送到村政府，并召开群众会，揭穿了反动分子的无耻阴谋。群众都说：“坏蛋不悔过，还来这一套！”村干表示决不受反动派贿赂，彻底肃清特务。乃责令老太婆把蜂蜜取回。又，五里坨李洪逵（三青团第八区队长）在这次登记开始时，说政府对他太宽了，无法感谢，于是用钢笔贿赂我登记组负责人员，当被严加拒绝。其后他又让新从革命大学毕业回家的张德鑫（李所属下的分队长）对登记组负责人说：“李洪逵实在太为难了，你们宽大他吧！这次也不要深追他的材料，我们准备给股长和局长弄点礼物（人民券），以表寸心。”我负责同志当将李洪逵叫到登记组，除留登记组教育反省外，并揭破他这些诡计。
