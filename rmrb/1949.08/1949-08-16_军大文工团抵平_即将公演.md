　　Military University Performing Arts Troupe Arrives in Beiping
　　Soon to Perform
    [Our Dispatch] In order to establish close ties and foster friendship with various schools in Beiping, the Military University's First General Amateur Drama Troupe has held joint gatherings with more than 30 schools in Beiping. Students have requested further exchange of learning experiences. More than ten schools in Beiping have successively organized visiting groups to our school's First General Brigade for observation. The Beiping Summer Youth Academy, with over one hundred students, participated in the First General Brigade's "August 1st" military parade commemoration and the graduation ceremony of the First and Second Battalion preparatory classes. To establish even closer ties with various schools in Beiping, our school's main Performing Arts Troupe arrived in Beiping a few days ago and will soon perform in Beiping.
