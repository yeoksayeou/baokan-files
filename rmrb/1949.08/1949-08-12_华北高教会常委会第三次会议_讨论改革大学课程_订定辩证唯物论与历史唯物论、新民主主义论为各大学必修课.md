    North China Higher Education Committee Standing Committee Third Meeting
    Discusses Reforming University Courses
    Mandating Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism, and New Democracy Theory as Required Courses for All Universities
    [Ping City News] The North China Higher Education Committee convened its third Standing Committee meeting on the 10th. Committee members present included Dong Biwu, Chairman of the Committee, Vice-Chairmen Zhang Xiruo and Qian Junrui, and Standing Committee members Ma Xulun, Zhou Yang, Xu Deheng, Zeng Zhaolun, Wu Han, and others. The meeting began with reports from Qian Junrui, Vice-Chairman, Zhang Zonglin, Secretary-General, Wang Yeqiu, Director of the Cultural Relics Department, and Feng Naichao, Director of the North China University Graduates Summer Study Group, on various work matters. The committee members then engaged in detailed discussions and made decisions regarding the establishment of common required courses for all universities, the reform of courses in various departments of the liberal arts colleges, and the renovation, organization, and preservation of various cultural heritage buildings. Regarding the reform of university courses, it was decided that the common required courses for all university departments and colleges would be Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism (including a brief history of social development) and New Democracy Theory (including a brief history of the modern Chinese revolutionary movement). Each course would be three hours per week and completed in one semester. Liberal arts colleges will add Political Economy as a required course. It would be three hours per week and completed in one academic year. The meeting also adopted the principles of the reports from the course reform groups for various departments (Literature, History, Philosophy, Politics, Economics, Law, Education) of the liberal arts colleges organized by the first Standing Committee, and tasked the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen to consult with the conveners of each group to determine the main content of the courses in each department based on these principles. During the discussion on the budget issues of various universities, colleges, and cultural relics institutions, Dong Biwu and Qian Junrui emphasized that today, cultural and educational undertakings are still in the recovery phase, and it is not yet possible to develop them greatly. Currently, the country's finances are difficult, and the people bear a heavy burden. All cultural and educational institutions and schools must practice strict streamlining and thrift, and all non-urgent expenditures must be reduced. Finally, the budget principles proposed by the three-person funding group were adopted. A principled decision was also made regarding the transportation of cultural relics and books stored in Shanghai and Nanjing by the Palace Museum and the Peiping Library to the north, and the Cultural Relics Department will formulate a specific plan for implementation. In addition, the establishment of a Medical Education Committee and other proposals were also approved.
