　　Qinghe Woolen Mill Cotton Weaving Department Reviews Leadership's Drift
  　Corrects the Tendency of Lowering Quality
    Decides to Strengthen Worker Education and Uphold Labor Discipline
    Huang Cheng
    [Our Newspaper] The Cotton Weaving Department of Qinghe Woolen Mill, responding to the demands of the masses, held a work review meeting to deeply examine the reasons for the recent decline in product quality. They accepted lessons and decided to adhere to labor discipline and reward/punishment methods, strengthen worker education, and lead all workers to ensure "high output, good quality, and low cost."
    Since the implementation of piece-rate wages in August, the output of the Cotton Weaving Department has greatly increased, with most workers exceeding the standard output. However, the quality has not improved. On August 11th, 300 bolts of white cloth were sent to the trade company to exchange for yarn, and 202 bolts were found to be substandard. Most were due to insufficient density and width, and some were woven with defects. The original regulation stipulated 26 weft yarns per half inch, but the factory was weaving only 22 or 21. The insufficient width was due to the humidity causing the yarn to shrink, but mainly because the leadership of the department did not grasp the situation well, and the workers were greedy for quantity and inattentive. For example, Bai Yushan, a worker on machine #2, wove several bolts of cloth with only 19 weft yarns. Mu Tongxiang, who operates the motor, previously wove a bolt of defective cloth with several holes. After being criticized, he still did not change, and next time still wove several holes. Knowing that it was woven badly, he still did not unravel the yarn, only pursuing quantity, which caused the quality to decrease. The leadership did not take effective measures to correct these phenomena in a timely manner because they were afraid of "offending people" and adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards labor discipline, fearing that workers would "raise opinions" with the union, resulting in losses in production. After everyone raised their opinions, the leadership reviewed their drift and formulated measures to ensure improved quality. They are now strengthening worker education to improve quality.

　　清河制呢厂棉织部检讨领导自流
  　纠正质量降低偏向
    决定加强工人教育坚持劳动纪律
    黄诚
    【本报讯】清河制呢厂棉织部接受群众要求，召开工作检讨会，深入检讨最近产品质量变低的原因，接受经验教训，决坚持执行劳动纪律、奖惩办法，加强工人教育，领导全体工人保证“产量多，质量好，成本低。”
    该厂自从八月份实行按件计资后，棉织部产量大大提高，大多数超过标准产量，但是质量没有提高。八月十一日运了三百匹白布到贸易公司去换纱，检查出二百零二匹不及格。大半是因为密度和宽度不够，也有织残了的。原来规定半英寸标准纬纱二十六根，但该厂所织只有二十二或二十一根。宽度不够的原因除了因天气潮湿，纱线抽缩，因而宽度不够外，主要是因该部领导上未好好掌握，工人贪多不用心。例如该厂二号车车工白玉山一连织几匹纬纱都只有十九根。开电机的牟同祥，上一回织出一匹有几个洞的残布，经过批评后仍然不改，下次仍织出几个窟窿，明知织坏了，还不拆线，只图数量，使质量降低。对于这些现象，领导上未及时作有效纠正，因为他们怕“得罪人”，对劳动纪律采取放任自流态度，怕工人到职工会“提意见”，以致使生产受了损失。后经大家提出意见，领导上检讨了自流偏向，并拟订了保证提高质量的办法，现正加强工人教育，力求改进质量。    （黄诚）
