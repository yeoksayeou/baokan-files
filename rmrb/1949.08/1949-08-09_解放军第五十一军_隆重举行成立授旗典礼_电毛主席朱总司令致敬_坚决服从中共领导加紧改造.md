Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, August 8th: The former Kuomintang army unit under Zhang Zhen, which revolted in southern Hubei, was ordered to be reorganized into the Chinese People's Liberation Army 51st Army. A solemn ceremony was held on the "August 1st" Army Day celebration to mark the army's founding and flag conferral. At the meeting, Yang Chunpu, the political commissar of the army, read out the order of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission on behalf of the Central China Military Region and presided over the flag conferral ceremony. In his speech, Commissar Yang emphasized the glorious significance of this uprising and the acceptance of the new designation, and pointed out the essential differences between the reactionary army and the people's army, as well as the glorious and brilliant history and excellent revolutionary system and style of the people's army. Commissar Yang focused on the relationship between the army and the people, the relationship between officers and soldiers, and the democratic style of the army. He encouraged all officers and soldiers to study hard, change the erroneous systems and styles of the old army, learn from the old People's Liberation Army brother units, perform meritorious service for the people, and thoroughly transform the 51st Army into a truly genuine people's army. Army Commander Zhang Zhen said: "In the past, we were a reactionary force and did many things that were sorry to the people. Now we are aware of our mistakes, and our revolt and coming over to the people's side is our new life. We want to swear an oath to the people and prove our determination to serve the people with facts. Although we have gloriously accepted the designation and flag of the People's Liberation Army 51st Army, it is not enough if our ideology and actions are not thoroughly transformed. We must learn from the old comrades and conscientiously and thoroughly transform the troops, and plant the red flag given to us by the higher authorities in the hearts of every commander and fighter, so that it will always be bright and glorious." Subsequently, Deputy Army Commander Yang Huanmin elaborated on the direction of the 51st Army's consolidation and construction, and then the entire officers and soldiers passed telegrams to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu (telegram to be sent separately), and the leaders of the Central China Military Region. In the telegram to the leaders of the Central China Military Region, all the officers and soldiers expressed: We swear that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we will abide by all the instructions of the leaders, learn humbly, transform ourselves.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, August 8th: All the officers and soldiers of the army, which was ordered to be reorganized into the Chinese People's Liberation Army 51st Army, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu at the flag conferral ceremony, which reads as follows:
    Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu: On this great day of "August 1st," we held a grand commemoration meeting in our garrison and accepted the designation and flag of the People's Liberation Army 51st Army. All officers and soldiers were jubilant and grateful to the Chinese Communist Party for turning us away from the dark dead end forced upon us by the Kuomintang reactionaries and guiding us onto the bright path of new life. Since the uprising, the welcome and forgiveness of the people, the care and help of the brotherly troops, and the kind care of the leaders at all levels have made us personally experience the warmth of being in a revolutionary family. From now on, we are determined to reflect on our past mistakes and resolutely and thoroughly correct them. We sincerely wish to intensify our studies under your wise leadership, transform our thinking, abolish the old reactionary systems and styles, improve the relationship between the army and the people and between officers and soldiers, resolutely protect the interests of the people, and make the 51st Army a true people's army worthy of the name.
        The entire officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army 51st Army kowtow.
          August 1st
