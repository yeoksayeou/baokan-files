    Medical and Health Work in North China is Underway
    Nearly 200 Public Hospitals
    Government Allocates 1.8 Million Jin of Rice for Free Medical Treatment
    To Help Peasants Alleviate Suffering
    Doctors Organized to Go to the Countryside
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Public hospitals and various medical organizations in the North China region are developing rapidly. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 178 public hospitals in the region, an increase of 78% compared to last year, and 67 are under construction. There are 109 jointly operated public-private clinics and 176 pharmaceutical cooperatives. There are twelve epidemic prevention medical teams. In order to enable poor people to have access to medical treatment, the North China People's Government has allocated 1.8 million jin of millet as the region's annual free medical fund. For example, in the former Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, each hospital can have 1,000 jin of millet per month for free medical treatment, and at least 20 seriously ill patients can receive free treatment. In the past six months, according to incomplete statistics from public hospitals in various regions, the number of outpatients has reached 1.35 million.
    A few of these hospitals were taken over, but most of them were built under the leadership of the People's Government, overcoming various difficulties, and they have relieved a lot of suffering for the masses over the years, making a great contribution. In order to further improve the people's health undertakings and serve the broad masses more effectively, the Health Department of the North China People's Government issued instructions to various regions in June this year, requiring all public hospitals to quickly overcome past biases and to standardize various systems that hospitals should have, such as hospital staffing, personnel allocation, accounting expenditures, consultation procedures, and charging standards. Judging from the current situation, although the health work in the entire North China region has achieved the above-mentioned results due to the vigorous promotion of the People's Government and the active support of the broad masses of people, the vast rural areas still extremely lack medical conditions today, and there are still activities of witches or "divine doctors" in various places. For example, in the sixth district of Zanhuang, there are still 100 witches treating the masses, and in the former Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Hebei-South areas, there are superstitious groups who disturb social order by using the pretext of seeing a doctor, seeking gods, and worshiping Buddha, all of which should be banned in a timely manner. In view of these situations, the Ministry of Health has proposed to vigorously use the method of mobile medical treatment to go deep into the countryside. For example, in the second sub-district of the former Taihang area, 850 doctors were organized to go to the countryside in May. After the health conference in January, public hospitals in various regions have gradually changed the past views of waiting for patients to come to the door and simply seeking profits. For example, Taihang Peace Hospital has organized rural midwifery training classes and organized mobile medical teams to actually participate in local work and investigate local diseases.
    Since entering the city, the Ministry of Health has paid attention to absorbing and training medical personnel to go to the countryside. A total of 172 people have been assigned to work in various places, and another 200 are currently in training. Of the 207 students who graduated from the North China Health School in early May, 49 were retained in the headquarters epidemic prevention team, and the rest were assigned to the health agencies of Hebei Central, Jin Central, Hebei South, Taiyue, and the provinces of Chahar, Taiyuan, and Shijiazhuang. Each administrative office is handling short-term training courses for midwives and traditional birth attendants, with 453 people being trained. According to statistics from the eight administrative districts and cities of the former Taihang, Hebei Central, and Hebei South areas at the end of February, 199 acupuncturists and midwives have been trained. In May, the second and fifth special districts of the former Taihang area trained 325 traditional birth attendants. At present, there are twelve health training classes throughout the region, ranging from half-year courses to medical colleges, with 1,622 students.

    华北医疗卫生工作开展
    公立医院近二百所
    政府拨米百八十万斤免费诊疗
    帮助农民解病苦
    组织医生下乡去
    【本报特讯】华北区公立医院与各种医疗组织正迅速发展。据不完全统计，全区现共有公立医院一百七十八所，较去年增加了百分之七十八，正在建设中的有六十七所。公私合办的诊疗所有一百零九所，医药合作社一百七十六所。防疫医疗队有十二个单位。为了使贫苦群众能有治病机会，华北人民政府特拨发一百八十万斤小米，作为全区全年免费医疗的经费，如原冀鲁豫区，每个医院每月可有一千斤小米的免费诊疗费，至少有二十个重病人可以得到免费治疗。半年来，据各地公立医院不完全的统计，门诊人数有一百三十五万人。
    这些医院有少数是接管的，大部分是在人民政府领导下，克服各种困难，艰辛地建设起来的，历年来曾为广大群众解除了不少痛苦，贡献是很大的。华北人民政府卫生部为了进一步作好人民的卫生事业，更有效地为广大群众服务，于今年六月份曾向各地发出指示，要求各公立医院迅速克服过去存在的偏向及对医院应有的各种制度如医院编制、人员配备、会计开支、就诊手续及收费标准等均作出统一规定。就目前情形看，华北全区的卫生工作，由于人民政府的大力推动，和广大人民的积极支持，虽已得到上述成绩，但广大农村今天还是极端缺乏医疗条件，各地仍有巫婆或神医之类的活动。如赞皇六区还有一百个巫婆替群众看病，原冀鲁豫、冀南等地有迷信团体，假借看病求神拜佛，进行扰乱社会治安，都应及时予以取缔。根据这些情况，卫生部曾提出大力使用巡回医疗的办法，深入到农村中去，如原太行二分区，五月份曾组织医生下乡，参加人数共八百五十人。各地公立医院于一月卫生会议后，已逐渐改变了过去那种等病人上门和单纯营利的观点，如太行和平医院举办了农村助产训练班，组织巡回医疗队，实际参加了地方工作，调查了地方疾病。
    自入城后，卫生部即注意了吸收并培养医务人员下乡，计先后分配到各地工作的有一百七十二名，现尚有二百名在训练中。华北卫生学校五月初毕业的二○七名学生，除四九名留在本部防疫队外，其余已分配给冀中、晋中、冀南、太岳及察省、太原、石家庄的卫生机关。各行署均正办理短期助产士、产婆训练班，受训人有四百五十三名。据二月底原太行、冀中、冀南等八个行署区、市统计，已训练了针灸士、助产士一百九十九名。五月份原太行二、五专区已训练三百二十五名产婆。现全区半年制的卫生训练班直至医学院共有十二处，学生有一六二二人。
