Overly Exhausting Amateur Track Maintenance
　　Affects Normal Production
　　Fengtai Outer Stations Should Rectify Immediately
　　[Report from this newspaper] To ensure traffic safety and tidy station appearance, the Fengtai area stations and sections of the Pingjin Railway Administration launched an amateur joint track maintenance campaign in mid-July. Four thousand employees enthusiastically cleaned the ballast in the station. In a month, the roadbed was repaired for 30 kilometers. Within Fengtai Station, 21 kilometers needed and could be repaired. The 2,300 employees of various departments were each assigned 7 to 8 meters. In the spirit of mutual help and common improvement, technical guidance groups were organized in a timely manner to ensure the required standards and quality. Each person will complete the task within 15 to 20 working hours, which is good. However, at outer stations, due to the small number of employees, each person was generally assigned 40 to 50 meters, and up to 80 meters in some cases. To complete the task, they had to desperately work overtime voluntarily. As a result, a tendency towards excessive fatigue affecting normal production occurred during the campaign. Taking Huangtupo as an example, the entire station had 50 people, responsible for cleaning 4,400 meters. In a month of continuous labor, each person completed an average of about 15 meters. Employees had very little rest time during the day. Some, unable to support themselves physically, spent money to buy tickets to bring relatives to stay for a longer period and sift ballast. This seems admirable, but it does not entirely align with their own wishes. Some of the healthier track maintenance workers, due to continuous labor in the scorching heat, saw three out of twenty-three workers fall ill in ten days. Two incidents of violating signal operation procedures occurred in July, also related to the old and overly fatigued signalmen. Regarding track maintenance production, foreman Liu You Shun told the reporter: "In the past, each person averaged nine sleeper replacements per day, but in recent months, it has only been maintained at eight, because some energy has to be reserved for amateur ballast sifting!" It is unclear whether other stations are the same, but at least employees generally feel that the continuous amateur production campaign is a major burden. A switchman at Wanzhuang Station said: "Resting is not as good as working." This means that amateur labor is more tiring than normal production work. Recently, the labor union and the engineering section jointly notified each station to clean no more than 30 meters of ballast per person, which employees agreed to. But this is only the beginning of attention, and the gains and losses of the campaign must be examined fundamentally.

### 业余养路过度疲劳　影响正常生产　丰台外站应即纠正

　　业余养路过度疲劳
  　影响正常生产
  　丰台外站应即纠正
    【本报讯】平津铁路管理局丰台地区各站段，为保证行车安全与站容整齐，于七月中旬发起业余联合养路运动，四千名职工，热烈清筛站内道碴。一月来，整修道床达三十公里。丰台站内需要整修而可能整修的二十一公里，各部职工两千三百人，每人分担七米至八米，大家在互相帮助，共同提高的精神下，适时的组织了技术指导组，保证了所要求的标准质量，且每人将在十五至二十个工时内完成任务，这是好的。但外站由于员工少，一般的每人分担四五十米，最多到八十米；要完成任务，只有拼命的去义务加班，因此，运动中发生工友过度疲劳而影响正常生产的偏向。以黄土坡为例，全站五十人，负责清筛四千四百公尺，在一个月的持续劳动中，每人平均完成了十五米左右；员工白天极少休息时间，有的身体不能支持，便花钱买票接来家属亲戚，较长期的住着筛道碴，看来精神可佳，其实并不完全合乎自己的心意；身体较好的道班工，因冒盛暑连续劳动，二十三人十天病过三人；七月间曾发生两次违反办理信号事故，也与号志工年老过度疲劳有关系；在道班生产方面，工长刘有顺语记者：“过去每人每天平均抽换枕木九根，近月来，仅保持八根，因为有些精力得留着业余筛道碴哩！”其他各站是否如此，还不清楚，但至少职工普遍感到持续的业余生产运动是个大的负担。万庄站转辙工说：“歇班不如当班。”意思是说业余劳动较正常生产的活计还累。近来工委、工务段联合通知各站清筛道碴，每人最多不超过三十米，职工表示同意。但这仅是注意的开始，尚须从基本上考查运动的得失。
