    Shanghai News: Shanghai's industry is undergoing a transformation. People firmly believe that with the support of vast urban and rural areas throughout the country and the assistance of the Soviet Union, coupled with the hard work of all workers and industrialists in the city, Shanghai's industry can completely overcome its existing difficulties and gradually embark on the path of self-reliance, prosperity, and development. Shanghai's industry is mainly based on iron and steel machinery, chemicals, and textiles. In the past, the iron and steel machinery industry needed to import silicon steel sheets, steel plates, special steel, refractory materials (magnesia bricks, chrome bricks), and diesel fuel. Since liberation, Shanghai factories have taken considerable measures to adopt various possible substitutes. Factories such as the China Agricultural Machinery Company, Shanghai Iron and Steel Company, and Universal Machinery Company have all made preparations to convert diesel furnaces to burn coal. The Shanghai Iron and Steel Company has already used dolomite instead of magnesia bricks and chrome bricks, and the effectiveness is no worse than before. Industrial circles in Northeast China and Shanghai have launched research work on silicon steel sheets and steel plates. Anshan already has steel plate production, and quality may be improved after further research. In Shanghai's heavy industry, the storage volume is sufficient for current needs. As for rubber used in the chemical industry, artificial rubber has been trial-produced in Northeast China. In addition to Shanghai having ample reserves, old rubber tires can also be remanufactured and used. Regarding substitutes for gasoline, the chemical industry is preparing to revive the alcohol industry, which was popular in the southwest in previous years. In the pharmaceutical industry, some imported Western medicines, such as ephedrine, were originally made by buying raw materials from China, processing them abroad, and then selling them back to China. In the future, they can all be made domestically. Other industries, such as soap, have found domestic substitutes. In terms of the textile industry, Shanghai can manufacture complete sets of cotton and wool textile machinery, and the supply of raw cotton can also be resolved. Currently, in addition to the yarn factories finding their own ways to purchase cotton, the Trade Bureau is purchasing cotton from cotton-producing areas in the Northwest, North China, and Central China. Most other industries focus on agricultural processing, which relies even less on foreign goods. This has increased the confidence of industrial and commercial circles in self-reliance. The news that the Northeast People's Government and the Soviet Union have established a barter agreement has brought even greater excitement to industrial and commercial circles. They firmly believe that Shanghai will be able to overcome the enemy's blockade, get rid of the various difficulties caused by imperialism and reactionaries, and develop and grow stronger.

    在全国城乡和苏联支援下
    上海工业可以自力更生
    【本报讯】上海消息：上海工业在转变中，人们深信上海工业在全国各地广大城乡及苏联援助之下，再加上该市全体职工和产业界的艰苦努力，完全可以克服现有的种种困难，逐步走上自力更生、繁荣发展的道路。上海的工业以钢铁机械、化学及纺织为主。钢铁机械工业过去需要从国外来的是矽钢片、钢板、特殊钢、耐火材料（镁砖、铬砖）和柴油等。解放后，上海各厂已经采取了相当措施，采用各种可能的代用品。中农机械公司、上海钢铁公司、通用机器公司等厂，都已作了改装柴油炉烧煤的准备工作。上海钢铁公司已用白云石代替镁砖和铬砖，效能并不比过去差。东北和上海工业界对于矽钢片、钢板等，都已展开研究工作。鞍山已有钢板生产，继续研究后可能提高品质。上海重工业中，存储量可够目前需用。化学工业用的橡胶，在东北已经试制人造橡胶，上海除存底尚丰外，旧橡皮轮胎还可以重制应用。汽油代用品，化工界已筹备重振当年盛行西南的酒精工业。制药业方面，若干外来西药如麻黄素等，本来是从中国买了原料去外国加工后再销到中国来的，此后都可着手自制。其他如肥皂等项工业，都已经找到国产的代用品。纺织工业方面，整套棉毛纺织机器上海都能自制，原棉当亦能解决。目前除各纱厂自行设法收购外，贸易局正在向西北、华北和华中产棉区收购中。其他工业大多偏重于农产加工之类，仰给于外货的更少。因此增加了工商界自力更生的信心，东北人民政府和苏联成立易货协定的消息，给工商界带来更大的兴奋。佥信上海必能战胜敌人的封锁，摆脱帝国主义和反动派造成的各种困难而发展壮大起来。
