    Li Xinrong's Lumber Mill
    Zhang Xingwu
    Li Xinrong is a shrewd and honest farmer from Guotun Village in Anping. Besides farming his 15 and a half mu of land year-round, he also weaves cloth in his spare time. Skillfully pulling the shuttle, he can weave one and a half bolts of cloth each day. Moreover, the market for homespun cloth was quite good in the past two years, and he could earn a dou or so of sorghum for each bolt woven. As a result, his family of five lived a pretty good life.
    The saying "skill begets courage" is indeed true. Li Xinrong often said, "Relying on my loom alone, it wouldn't be a big deal to support three or five people." After the autumn harvest, he traded the grain he harvested for half a cow, still planning to support his family by weaving. Who knew that after the liberation of major cities one after another, foreign cloth flooded the market, and weaving homespun cloth was no longer as profitable as before? Therefore, he planned to engage in other timely sideline businesses.
    At the beginning of this year, the peasants who had been liberated were all planning to build houses. As a result, purlins, lumber, and household utensils were all being snapped up in the market. Everyone was saying, "The lumber market is really booming. Opening a lumber mill would be a great thing." But how could Li Xinrong not think so? He had learned half the skills of a carpenter when he was young, and he had all the necessary furniture, so he kept planning: "Stop weaving, switch trades, and open a lumber mill!"
    However, opening a lumber mill isn't something one person can do alone. First of all, you need a few strong young men to work together to do it well; secondly, it's not easy to constantly haul things in and out without livestock or a cart; also, you need to raise some capital to get started. These things turned over and over in Li Xinrong's mind. At the same time, the reality before his eyes was that relying solely on weaving could no longer solve the family's expenses. He had to find a way to switch trades in order to do a good job with sideline production. So, he found people in the village who were planning to engage in sideline businesses and discussed the matter of opening a lumber mill.
    Da Geng and Xin Yi, the two brothers, were both willing to produce more and had long thought about opening a lumber mill, but they were somewhat concerned that "business is easy to do, but it's hard to find partners," so they never really got started. When Li Xinrong discussed it with them, they all said, "During the spring famine, raising capital is a tough nut to crack, and we're mostly novices, so I'm afraid it won't work!" He patiently explained his plans to them, "Everything is difficult at the beginning! Our capital is small, so we have to do it on a small scale. We can also take on some contracted work. Work is fast in the spring, and the novices can do more work splitting firewood, which can be sold as soon as it's stacked. Wouldn't the capital turn over even faster?" They had already seen how Wang Xingye's lumber mill in the village had started up. He also encouraged them, "It doesn't matter if people don't have skills. As the saying goes, 'Nothing is impossible to a willing heart.' We just need to have the spirit of learning until we're old, and after a long time, we'll be able to do anything." Da Geng thought that this was also the truth, and immediately added, "Don't talk about others, just look at Brother Xinrong, isn't he just half a carpenter who hasn't apprenticed to anyone? As long as we're willing to work, we can do it." Everyone thought that it was worth giving it a try, but they still wanted to think about it some more.
    At this time, Zhang Guotai in the village had some lumber and came to Li Xinrong to discuss contracting to make carts and handcarts. He thought to himself, "We're opening a lumber mill and we're just worried about not being able to get started. Why not seize the opportunity and do it!" So, he agreed in a few words.
    When they first started, Li Xinrong told them to try it out first, and if everyone thought it was okay, then they would work together. He divided the four people into two groups to work. The people sawing and splitting boards were working with a burning passion and were very energetic. During breaks, they would pick up axes, chisels, adzes, and saws to learn a skill. He patiently taught them by hand, saying, "Saw lightly and pull hard; the adze should be steady, the plane should be flat, don't rush to learn a skill; if you grind an iron rod into a needle, skill will come naturally with effort."
    Just as everyone was working energetically, the clothing factory in Zhangjiazhuang, a neighboring village, urgently needed a large amount of firewood and was constantly buying it in the village. This directly stimulated their enthusiasm for opening a lumber mill. They used 48 jin of work grain from making looms, along with three dou of sorghum collected from each person, as capital, and started a small lumber mill.
    First, they bought three broken willow trees and also contracted the job of making desks and benches for the school. Da Geng and the others were responsible for splitting firewood and cutting the materials into rafters for building houses; Li Xinrong and Xin Yi made desks and benches. They all had the spirit of "the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each showing their special abilities." Even if they were sweating all over, no one wanted to take a break. Especially Li Xinrong, who had to take care of everyone inside and out, and every job required his guidance. For example, he would look at the grain of the wood before wedging pieces that others couldn't split, and open it with three or five powerful blows of the hammer. Da Geng said, "Skill, skill, doing work depends on the posture. Old Xin's hammer is really powerful. If we had to do it, wouldn't we find it difficult?"
    In less than half a month, everyone worked hard and finished all the work. The semi-dry firewood was sold, and added to the wages for making desks and benches, they prepared goods for the Chengguan March Temple Fair. Twenty elm purlins, as well as finished doors, windows, and rafters, were all taken there. Just in time for people building houses to rush to buy lumber, the market was not bad. After the temple fair, the net profit was estimated to be more than three times the capital. Everyone said, "When three people work together with one heart, yellow earth turns into gold. This is really true. Not to mention anything else, the remaining elm firewood is almost enough to cover the capital!"
    Li Xinrong's lumber mill is booming, not only because he can effectively control sales and quickly turn over the finished products, but also because he leads the work very effectively. He himself has had many years of hard work, and from the beginning he had the determination to "make a name for himself." When he works, he really puts in more effort than he does for his own family's affairs. His own family affairs, such as feeding the livestock, sweeping the yard, getting firewood, and carrying water, are all entrusted to his family members. He often advises his wife, "When we lead work, we have to set an example. 'If the upper beam is not straight, the lower beams will be crooked.' If we can't stand on our own feet first, how can we lead others!" When he works, he often stays behind after everyone else has left to put away the tools, tidy up the wood chips, and sweep the yard clean before leaving. This influenced the sleepy Da Geng, who said, "I used to not be able to get out of bed until the sun was high, a problem that I hadn't been able to fix for many years, but Old Xin has cured me."
    They adhere to the spirit of "agriculture to support the family, sideline businesses to get rich" and appropriately allocate manpower to do work. Since the start of spring plowing, they have established a system of meeting every night, mainly to decide on the next day's work in the mill based on each person's farming activities. If someone's absence affects the work in the mill, then someone else will be asked to plow their land for them, so as to ensure that production is not affected by each other. They all rely on their own initiative, and unless there is a necessary matter at home, no one is willing to be late or leave early. During the days of sowing, Da Geng's livestock was not available in turn, so Li Xinrong lent his to him, and the mill sent two people to help pull the seed box. Everyone felt that it was very convenient to open a mill for everything. Da Geng's father, who liked it very much, said, "If it weren't for opening the mill, I would have had to wait for a while because I didn't have livestock. I'm sick again this year and haven't been able to start, but the land has been planted."
    In addition, Li Xinrong is very fair in dealing with things. For the management of accounts, he appointed two people to be responsible. All expenses of the mill are recorded publicly, and the accounts are very clear. When it comes to sharing money, he always lets others use a little more first, while he himself consistently "works ahead and spends behind," how can he not be admired!
    By the time of the wheat harvest, wholesale buying and selling of trees had gradually decreased, and everyone was busy weeding, planting vegetables, and engaging in agricultural production. Therefore, they used the money earned at the temple fair in April to buy some dry wood, in order to make finished goods in their spare time during the busy farming season. Now they are preparing to accumulate capital and wait until after the autumn harvest to expand their strength. They must do a good job.

    李欣荣的木厂
    张星五
    李欣荣是安平郭屯村一个精明又诚朴的庄稼人。常年价除了种着十五亩半地以外，一年到头都抽闲织布，熟练的拉起梭子，每天能织一个半布。同时又赶上前两年土布的销路挺好，织个布就得赚上斗数的高粮，所以一家五口的小日子，过得很不错。
    “艺高人胆大”的话，确是如此的。李欣荣常说：“光仗着我这织布机子，养上三口五口子人也不大要紧。”年上秋后，他把打的粮食换成了半头牛，仍然在打算着织布来养家。那知道各大城市相继解放后，市面上的洋布挤了土布，织土布就不如从前好赚钱了。这样，他就打算再搞别的应时的副业。
    今年刚一开春，翻了身的农民，都在筹划着盖房子。因此，集市上的檩木木材和家常用具，都是抢着来买。谁也都说：“木货市里真热闹，开个木厂子就是挺好的事。”可是李欣荣又何尝不这样想呢？他打年轻的时候，就学会了半套木匠活，用的家具也制备的很齐全，所以他不断的在计划着：“不织布了，跳个行，开木厂吧！”
    但是，提起开木厂来，并不是一个人能办得到的。头一件，先得有几个壮实的小伙子，搭起伙来才会干得好；再一说，不断的拉出拉进，都没有牲口，没有车，也是不好办；另外，还得多少凑点本钱，才能开头。这些事，在李欣荣的脑袋里不知转了多少圈子。而同时摆在眼前的事实，专靠织布已不能解决家里的零用钱，非得设法跳行是不能搞好副业的。于是，他便在村里找到打算搞副业的人，商量开木厂子的事。
    大庚和信义他们哥俩，都是愿意多生产的，老早便想着开个木厂子，只是有点“买卖好做，伙计难搭”的顾虑，始终也没有闹起来。当李欣荣和他们商量时，都是说：“春荒焦月的，打饥荒（本钱）是个硬头子，还多是生手，怕办不成呢！”他便把自己的打算，向他们耐心的解释着：“什么事也是开头难！咱们本钱小，要往小处做，揽点包干的活也行了，春天干的快，生手们多干点劈木柴的活，一推就卖出，本钱不是周转的更快吗？”这些事实，他们早已见过当村王兴业的木厂，是这样搞起来的。他又用鼓励的口吻来劝他们：“人们不会手艺不要紧，人常说：‘天下无难事，只怕有心人’，就是要咱们有做到老学到老的劲头，日子长了，什么活也会干得了。”大庚寻思着也是这般道理，紧接上去说：“不用说别人，就看欣荣哥还不是没有拜师傅的半个木匠吗？咱们只要肯干就能行。”大家都认为干一场是可以的，不过还是愿意多思想一番。
    这时，当村张锅台有根木头，找李欣荣来商量，打算包干做拖车、土车子，他心里话：“我们开木厂子，正愁着拉不开拴哩，为什么不来一个就坡骑驴干一场呢！”于是，三言两语便应承起来。
    刚开工的时候，李欣荣和他们说的先来试一试，大家认为行的话，就搭伙干起来。他把四个人分成两班做活。拉锯和解板子的人，都抱着火热的心情，干起来挺上劲头，稍一歇工，都要拿起锛、凿、斧、锯来，学一学手艺。他很耐心的亲手比画着去教，还说：“轻送锯，拉用力；锛要稳，刨要平，学活别着急；铁棒磨绣针，工到自然成。”
    大家正在干活上劲的当儿，邻村张家庄住的被服厂，正急需大量的劈柴不断来村采买，这件事直接刺激了他们开木厂的热情。便把做织布机的工米四十八斤，连同每人凑集的三斗高粮，做了本钱，就开始搞起小木厂来了。
    先买了三棵破柳树，又揽了学校打桌凳的包干活。大庚他们负责劈木柴，将打截出来的材料，解成盖房用的椽子；李欣荣和信义两人，就做起桌凳来。他们都抱着“八仙过海各显其能”的劲头，即便累得浑身流汗，谁也不愿意歇一歇。尤其是李欣荣又得顾里顾外的照料大家，那一件活也离不开他来指拨；比如：别人劈不开的木头，都是由他来看看木纹才下楔，用力打上个三五锤，就把它弄开了。大庚说：“把式，把式，做活看架式。老欣哥的锤头是真有劲，若叫咱们还不得看着做难吗！”
    不上半月的工夫，大家一股劲的干着，把所有的活做完了。半干的劈柴就卖出手去，再添上做桌凳的工钱，便预备城关三月庙会的货物。二十根榆树檩条，及做好的门、窗和椽子，全都拉了去。正赶盖房的人抢买木材，行市还算不错。下庙合算起来，除本净利也要赚到三倍以上。人们全说：“三人合了心，黄土变成金，真是一点也不假。不用别的，光剩下的榆木劈柴也就差不多够了本啦！”
    李欣荣的木厂搞得挺火爆，不仅能够切实地掌握销路，把做成的东西很快的周转回来；同时在领导做活上，也非常得法。他本身有着多年来的勤劳生活，打一开始就抱着“搞出明堂”的决心。干起活来真比自己家里的事，都要卖气力。家里的事，如喂牲口、扫院子、拿烧柴、和担水的事，都靠托给家里的人来做。常劝自己的老婆说：“咱领着干活，就得做出个样子来。‘上梁不正下梁歪’，自己若先站不住脚，怎能领导人呢！”他干活时，多会也是人们都走了，他才归弄家具，拾掇木片子，打扫得院里都挺干净，才会走开。这样，影响了贪睡的大庚说：“我早先太阳晒不住屁股，是不会起来的，多年没管过来的毛病，老欣哥把我治好了。”
    他们本着“农业养家，副业发家”的精神，来适当的配备力量做活。打春耕开始，就建立起每晚碰头的制度，主要的是根据了各人耕种土地的活，来决定第二天厂子里的事。假如离开这个人，影响了厂子里的活，那就叫别人来替他耕地，必须做到互不影响生产的原则。他们全靠着个人的自觉，只要家里没有必要的事，谁也不肯迟到早退的。当耩地的那几天，大庚家的牲口没有轮流过来，李欣荣便借给他去用，还由厂子里派去两个人帮着拉囤子，大家都感到开个厂子什么也挺方便。喜欢的大庚他爹说：“若不是开厂子，没有牲口就得先等一等。今年我又有病，没有着手，就把地种上了。”
    另外，李欣荣处事又非常公道。对于管帐款的事，推定两个人来负责，厂子里的一切开支，都得当众来记帐，脚手是拉的挺清楚。若是分着花钱时，他都是先尽让着别人多用一点，自己却一贯的是“干在前头，花在后头”，怎不令人敬佩呢！
    到麦收时，成批的买货和卖树的，已日渐减少，都忙着锄地、种菜，搞农业生产。因此，把四月里庙会上卖的钱，赶着买了一些干木材，以备农忙中抽闲来做熟货。现在他们正准备积蓄本钱，等着过秋后，还要扩大力量。一定要很好的搞起来。
      一九四九、八、十一。
