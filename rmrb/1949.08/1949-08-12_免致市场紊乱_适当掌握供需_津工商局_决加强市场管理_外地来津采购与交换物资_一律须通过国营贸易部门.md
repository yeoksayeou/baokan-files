    To Avoid Market Disruption
    Appropriately Control Supply and Demand
    Tianjin Industry and Commerce Bureau
    Determined to Strengthen Market Management
    All Procurement and Exchange of Goods from Other Provinces Must Go Through State-Owned Trading Departments
    [Tianjin News] The Military Control Commission has already issued a public notice regarding the management of procurement by various procurement agencies (including cooperatives above the county level) coming to Tianjin. In order to further strengthen market management, stabilize prices, and assist various procurement agencies in completing their purchasing and sales tasks, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce has, based on the instructions in the Military Control Commission's public notice, specifically stipulated the following points:
    1.  Any agency from other regions coming to Tianjin to exchange goods must have all goods transported to Tianjin for sale go through the municipal state-owned trading departments. Grains and beans shall be acquired or sold on commission by the Grain Company and the Municipal Cooperative General Society; other goods shall be sold on commission by the Trust Company, or temporarily stored or sold in designated warehouses approved by the Trust Company, and reports shall be made periodically. Private storage or entrustment to private merchants and warehouses for sale is strictly prohibited, otherwise it will be regarded as a violation of discipline.
    2. Agencies transporting goods to Tianjin wishing to exchange them for cotton yarn may have the state-owned trading departments that acquire or sell on commission handle the purchase on their behalf, or transfer them to the Industry and Commerce Bureau's Yarn and Cloth Exchange Office for registration and procurement in accordance with the prescribed procedures. The disruption of market order is not permitted. As for municipal agencies purchasing cotton yarn, they must also complete the same registration procedures. Those with larger quantities must prepare a cotton yarn procurement plan in advance in order to ensure a guaranteed supply for their needs.
    The above measures are of utmost importance to the market prices in this city, and all procurement agency personnel and merchants must abide by and implement them.
    [Another dispatch] In order to stabilize prices and strengthen market management, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce has recently begun to strictly inspect speculative behavior in public and private stores throughout the city based on various leads. In recent days, it has discovered various illegal acts by some public procurement departments and some warehouses, and the materials they operate have been frozen.

    免致市场紊乱
    适当掌握供需
    津工商局
    决加强市场管理
    外地来津采购与交换物资
    一律须通过国营贸易部门
    【天津讯】关于各地来津采购机关（包括县以上合作社在内）采购之管理，军管会前已布告周知。兹为进一步加强市场管理，稳定物价并协助各采购机关完成购销任务起见，本市工商局特又根据军管会布告指示，具体规定以下各点：
    一、各地机关来津进行物资交换者，其所运津出售之货物须一律通过本市国营贸易部门；粮豆类交由粮食公司与市合作总社收购或代售；其他货物一律交信托公司代售或由信托公司批准指定一定之货栈暂存或出售，按期作报告，不得私存或委托私商货栈出售，否则即以违犯纪律论。
    二、运货来津之机关欲交换纱布者，得由收购或代售之国营贸易部门代购或转为介绍工商局经纱布交易所办公处办理登记，依规定手续进行采购，不得紊乱市场秩序。至于本市机关购买纱布，也须同样履行登记手续，数量较大者更须预作纱布采购计划，以便掌握保证需用之供应。
    以上措施关系本市市场物价至为重要，各采购机关人员及商民务各遵守执行。
    【又讯】本市工商局为平抑物价加强市场管理，已于日前开始根据各种线索在市内严格检查公私营商店投机行为，日来已查获部分公营采购部门及部分货栈的各种违法事实，其所经营之物资均予以冻结。
