　　One Month at the Youth Academy
    Zi De
    On July 14th, more than 12,000 middle school students in Beiping, with joyous steps, entered the academy. From then on, the academy was always filled with loud singing and exuberant vigor. They entered a new semester.

    At the opening ceremony, Comrade Feng Wenbin pointed out that students should study well and play well, achieving physical and mental health. Comrade Peng Zhen said: "Students should lay the foundation for the skyscraper, learn the correct standpoints, viewpoints, and methods, and be good students of Mao Zedong."

    The purpose of the academy is to unite the vast number of students to engage in collective study during the summer vacation, improve themselves in collective activities, and spend a pleasant summer vacation. Moreover, the academy activities should be lively and vigorous, giving full play to the creativity and initiative of young people, making it diverse. Through these activities, cultivate the students' collective spirit and a worldview of serving the people. More than a dozen student representatives from various districts and schools responded to this call at the opening ceremony; many students also corrected incorrect thoughts such as "I came for cultural tutoring," "Entering the academy is just for fun," "I can make more friends," "To see if the Youth Academy is really just the summer camp of the past"...

    When they first arrived at the academy, many students held a wait-and-see attitude. "Let the cadres do a good job first, then we'll come!" This idea was prevalent among the students. So the first step was to mobilize the students to create their own academy, instilling their sense of ownership. Soon, the students moved into action. They formed construction teams, spontaneously and voluntarily weeding and cutting characters; lending their books to the academy, decorating and beautifying their own areas.

    The Youth Lecture series is the mainstay of learning in the academy. Its content includes political common sense, youth self-cultivation, popular science, and literature and art. The method of lecturing is a large class report. Students refer to materials on their own and freely organize discussions. Initially, many schools did not have discussions. Even the groups that started discussions, because they did not know how to prepare, just stared at each other during the meeting, not knowing where to start. Many people simply brought their ears to listen to others talk; those who did talk often split hairs and delved into terminology. If you said that labor creates the world, they would ask you "How did the amoeba create it?" Some were too far apart in their level; those with good theory would talk eloquently, monopolizing the meeting, while those who read less and less spoke; even the best groups reached conclusions too early and did not discuss deeply enough, let alone connect to reality. So many students were not interested in this kind of discussion.

    In terms of learning leadership, initially it was limited to administrative affairs, busy recording, drafting outlines, and studying problems, without adhering to the mass line; later, the leadership corrected this bias, and the district organized working teams to directly guide students in their studies. In terms of discussion methods, the Northeast District also created a typical evening talk, deriving several valuable experiences: (1) Conduct collective games before the discussion to open up the quiet scene and create a warm discussion atmosphere. (2) Do not use catalog-style outlines. Raise questions where students' thoughts are disordered. For example, such as the greatness of the working people or the greatness of Chairman Mao, etc., connect more with reality, discover problems, expose thoughts, and do not draw conclusions too early. (3) There must be strong leadership and advance arrangements, otherwise it is easy to go astray; one group in Gaogong, due to weak leadership, came to this wrong conclusion: "The starting point of everyone's thinking is selfish."

    This kind of forum-style evening talk, if arranged well, can solve problems well. The Southwest District Girls' Affiliated Middle School once held a forum on "Do times create heroes? Or do heroes create times?" and achieved very good results. Especially when the group leader is weak, it is very necessary to hold joint discussions between several groups. The Northeast District also implemented a kind of "you come and I go" group visit discussion, exchanging experiences and competing with each other, which was very effective.

    In the group discussions in each district, the study group first puts forward some questions about this lecture. For example, when talking about "individual freedom and collective freedom," they would raise questions such as "Are individual freedom and collective freedom contradictory?" and each group would have a casual talk. One group in Ji Gao Girls' Vocational School, when conducting a discussion on waiting thoughts, cited the idea of ​​farmers leaving everything to fate as an example, and all agreed that this was waiting thought; they also talked about the students' wait-and-see attitude of not taking the initiative to find things to do at work; the attitude of "loving to play ball, but not looking for the ball to play" is also a waiting thought; then analyze that the waiting thought is caused by passivity and lack of enterprising spirit, which is a great enemy of young people. Discussions like this, connected to reality and with guidance, are very welcome to the students.

    Lectures have been held ten to twelve times in each district, and more and more people are listening (more than during recreational activities). Generally, students ask to increase the number of lectures (originally scheduled for twice a week), which shows that students' demand for political study is becoming increasingly urgent. The speakers should speak in a thorough and simple way, making the content as story-like and interesting as possible, and cite many examples from life. The lectures by Comrades Ke Li and Khrushchev were the most popular among the students. As soon as they arrived, they were surrounded by students asking this and that.

    The reading rooms in the five districts have about 500 people borrowing books every day, and about 2,000 people visiting the reading rooms. From these figures, it can be seen that students have made great progress in this month.

    What problems have students solved in their thinking through a month of study? Let's start with the general ones! Through the report "From Ape to Man," students understood that the working people are the masters of history; that thought is the result of the accumulation of labor experience; that labor creates everything, not thought creates everything; affirmed that intellectuals should learn from the working people; and established a view of serving the working people. After listening to the report on the five modes of production, students recognized the past and future of social development, and the driving force for social progress is the contradiction between the forces of production and the relations of production. The report on "Collective Freedom and Individual Freedom" further enabled students to review their past lax style, criticize the habit of absolute individual freedom, and understand that only collective freedom can there be individual freedom, and collective freedom is the guarantee of individual freedom; collective freedom is achieved through long-term struggle, and in order to strive for permanent and greater freedom for the people, young people should organize and return to their own ranks—the New Democratic Youth League, and regard themselves as a screw in the revolutionary struggle. Many students understood the relationship between the individual and the collective and recognized that organization creates strength; so they automatically and happily approached the organization. The movement to strive to join the League is unfolding enthusiastically in various districts.

    Marxist-Leninist theory, saying it doesn't count as understanding, doing it counts as truly understanding; the half-day labor held in each district is a good example. The students thoroughly implemented the theory they learned into action, and they spontaneously and enthusiastically moved soil, built bricks, weeded, and shoveled the ground with a enthusiasm that was surprising. Moreover, they broke down school boundaries and displayed the collective spirit of unity, mutual assistance, and friendship.

    Individual progress is endless. A student in Guanghua Girls' Middle School was a devout Catholic. During the report on labor creating the world, she couldn't listen to it halfway through, but after half a day of labor, she doubted; like the road we built ourselves, the world is clearly the result of labor, how can it be said that God created it? She found the truth in actual action.

    Countless students went from having no thought to having thought; from vague to clear; from confused to recognizing the direction. They felt that they had improved in every aspect. A young student in the Northwest District gave "Beiping Youth" such a suggestion, he said: "The Youth Lecture series is too good, we have made great progress, but in many families, parents and children form two factions, anti-revolutionary and revolutionary. I propose that people from all walks of life in the city be divided into several groups to展开 study, and make them progress like we have." This is a naive and peculiar suggestion, but this suggestion also shows the students' view of the academy. The academy has achieved results, and all effective things should be universally promoted. The students of the academy are preparing to bring the spirit of collective mutual assistance, the lively and vigorous activities, and the enthusiastic learning atmosphere in the academy back to the school, and turn the school into a lovely academy.

　　青年学园一个月
    自德
    七月十四日，北平市一万二千多个中学同学，踏着愉快的步伐，走进了学园。从此学园里，总是弥漫着响亮的歌声，洋溢着蓬勃的朝气。他们又进入一个新的学期。
    在开园典礼上，冯文彬同志指出要同学们学得好，也要玩得好，做到身心健康。彭真同志说：“同学们要把万丈高楼的奠基石安排好，学会正确的立场、观点、方法，做一个毛泽东的好学生。”
    学习园的目的是团结广大同学利用暑假进行集体学习，并在集体活动中提高自己，愉快地度过暑假。而且学园活动要生动、活泼，发挥青年人的创造性与积极性，使它多种多样。通过这些活动，培养同学们的集体精神和为人民服务的人生观。十多个同学代表各区、各学校在开园典礼上响应了这个号召；很多同学也纠正了“我是为文化补习而来的”，“入学园只是为了热闹”，“可以多交几个朋友”，“看看青年学园到底是不是过去的夏令营”……不正确的想法。
    初来学园时，好多同学是持观望态度的。“让干部们搞好后，我们再来吧！”这种思想普遍在同学中存在。于是第一步工作是发动同学们来开创自己的学园，灌输他们的主人翁思想。很快地，同学们动起来了。他们组成建设队，自发自愿的锄草，剪字；把自己的书籍借给学园，布置、美化自己的园地。
    青年讲座是学园学习中的主力军。它的内容包括政治常识、青年修养、通俗科学与文艺。讲授的方式，是大课报告。同学们各自参考资料，自由组织讨论。最初很多学校没有讨论，即使讨论起来的小组，也因为不会准备，开会时，大眼瞪小眼，不知从何说起，很多人就干脆带着耳朵去听别人谈；谈起来的，也多是钻牛角尖，挖名词。你说劳动创造世界，他问你“阿米巴是哪样创造的？”有的程度相差太远，理论好的，就滔滔不绝，说一大通，垄断会场，书看得少的就越来越不说话；最好的小组也因为结论得出太早，讨论得不深入，至于联系实际，那就谈不上了。于是好多同学对这种讨论没有兴趣。
    在学习领导方面，最初因为限制在行政的事务工作里，忙记录，拟提纲，研究问题，没有坚持群众路线；后来领导上纠正了这个偏向，区里面组织了工作队到同学中去直接辅导他们学习。在讨论的方式上东北区也创造了晚叙会的典型，得出几点很宝贵的经验：（一）在讨论之先先进行集体游戏，打开沉静的场面，掀起热烈的讨论情绪。（二）不要目录式的大纲。在同学思想紊乱的地方提出问题。如象劳动人民伟大或是毛主席伟大等，多联系实际，发掘问题，暴露思想，不要很早就扣结论。（三）要有强的领导和预先布置，否则容易出偏差；高工有一个小组，因为领导的薄弱，得出这样错误的结论：“一切人的思想出发都是自私的。”
    这种座谈式的晚叙会布置得好，是很能解决问题的。西南区女附中曾经举行过一次“时势造英雄？英雄造时势？”的座谈会，成绩很好。尤其是在小组领导弱的时候，几组联合举行讨论大有必要。东北区又实行一种“你来我去”的小组拜访讨论，交流经验，互相竞赛，效用很大。
    在各区的小组讨论中，先都是由学习股提出一些关于这次讲座的问题。譬如讲“个人自由与集体自由”时，就提出“个人自由与集体自由是否矛盾？”等问题，各小组进行漫谈。冀高女职有一个小组在进行等待思想的讨论时，就举出农民听天由命的思想来谈，都认为这是等待思想；又谈到同学们在工作中不主动的积极的去找事做的观望态度；“爱玩球，但是不去找球来玩”的态度也是等待思想；再分析等待思想是由于消极和缺乏进取心所致，是青年人的大敌。象这样联系实际，有引导的讨论，同学们是很欢迎的。
    讲座在各区已举行了十次至十二次，听讲的人越来越多（比文娱活动时人还多）。一般同学都要求增加讲座次数（原订每周二次），足见同学们对政治学习的要求日益迫切。主讲人要讲得深入浅出，内容尽量故事化、兴趣化，多举生活中的实例。轲犁和赫鲁同志的讲演是最受同学欢迎的，他们俩一到那里就被同学围住，问这问那。
    五个区的阅览室每天借书的有五百人左右，到阅览室去的大约有两千人。从这些数目字中看得出在这一月中，同学们进步很大。
    一月来的学习，同学们在思想上到底解决了些什么问题呢？先从一般的来谈吧！通过“从猿到人”的报告，同学们搞通了劳动人民才是历史的主人；思想是劳动经验累积的成果；劳动创造一切而不是思想创造一切；肯定了知识分子应向劳动人民学习；建立了为劳动人民服务的观点。听了五种生产方式的报告，同学们认清了社会发展的过去与将来，推动社会前进的动力是生产力与生产关系的矛盾。“集体自由与个人自由”的报告更使同学们检讨了过去的涣散作风，批判掉绝对个人自由的习气，搞通了只有集体自由，才能有个人自由，而且集体自由是个人自由的保证；集体自由是要经过长期的斗争得来的，为了争取永久的，更大的人民的自由，青年人应该组织起来，回到自己的队伍——新民主主义青年团，把自己当成一个革命斗争中的螺丝钉。很多同学领会了个人与集体的关系，认清了组织才会产生力量；于是他们自动的愉快的靠近了组织。争取入团的运动，正在各区热烈的展开。
    马列主义的理论，会说不算懂，做了才算真懂；各区举行的半日劳动就是好例子。同学们把学来的理论彻底地贯彻到行动中去了，他们自发地热烈地搬土砌砖，拔草铲地热烈得使人惊奇。而且打破学校界线，发挥了团结、互助、友爱的集体精神。
    个别的进步，是数说不完的。光华女中有一个同学是一个虔诚的天主教信徒，在听劳动创造世界的报告中，半途就听不下去了，但是在半日劳动后她怀疑了；象我们自己修的路一样，世界明明是劳动的成果，怎么能说是上帝创造的呢？她在实际行动中，找到了真理。
    数不清的同学由没有思想到有了思想；由模糊到清楚；由迷乱到认清了方向。无论在那一方面他们都感到提高了。西北区有一个小同学给“北平青年”一个这样的建议，他说：“青年讲座太好了，我们获得很大的进步，但在很多家庭里，父母与子女形成反革命与革命两派，我提议把全市各阶层的人分成若干小组展开学习，象提高我们一样的使他们进步。”这是一个天真、奇特的建议，但由这个建议也看得出同学们对学园的看法。学园是有成绩的，凡是有效果的事都应普遍推行。学园的同学们正准备把学园中的集体互助的精神，生动活泼的活动方式，热烈的学习情绪带回学校去，把学校搞成一个可爱的学园。
