中华全国总工会 (All-China Federation of Trade Unions)

Regardless of how cleverly US imperialism invades China, the Chinese working class will never be fooled.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 19th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today issued a written statement strongly condemning the White Paper released by the US State Department. The full text of the statement is as follows:

No matter how the US imperialist policy towards China is disguised and distorted in the White Paper, and no matter what form it takes, its only purpose is to turn China into a colony of US imperialism. The Chinese working class and the broad masses of the Chinese people will never forget that when the Japanese devils were frantically invading China, it was none other than US imperialism that supplied large amounts of steel, gasoline, and munitions to help the Japanese devils massacre the Chinese people. After the Japanese devils surrendered, it was none other than US imperialism that sent planes and warships to actively help the Chiang Kai-shek bandits transport troops to the liberated areas of Northeast China, North China, East China, and Central China to fight the civil war; it was also none other than US imperialism that provided large amounts of munitions and money to support the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in expanding the civil war. Therefore, the US imperialist policy of aggression against China is incompatible with the policy of the Chinese working class and the broad masses of the Chinese people to strive for China's independence, freedom, democracy, peaceful unification. The US imperialist aggressive forces in China cannot coexist with the forces of the Chinese working class and the broad masses of the people striving for independence, freedom, peace, democracy and unification. A major conspiracy of US imperialism in publishing the White Paper this time is to use it to provoke the fraternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union and to divide the internal unity of the Chinese people, so as to achieve its anti-Soviet and anti-Chinese people's goals. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions would like to solemnly tell the US imperialists that your calculation is wrong again. The Chinese working class and the broad masses of the Chinese people know that since its founding, the Soviet Union has been the best friend of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people in their struggle for liberation; the Chinese people can only achieve their independence, freedom, peace, democracy and unification by uniting together to oppose US imperialist aggression. Therefore, no matter what clever methods US imperialism adopts in its policy of aggression against China, the Chinese working class will never be fooled. As soon as the Chinese working class stepped onto the political stage in China, it held high the clear banner of anti-imperialism, and under the leadership of its vanguard, the Chinese Communist Party, it bravely fought against imperialism for nearly 30 years. Today, it has become strong enough to unite the people of the whole country to eliminate the remaining forces of US imperialism in China. The policy of the Chinese working class led by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to deal with US imperialism is only one, that is, to further unite itself, unite the people, and under the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions headed by the Soviet working class, work with class brothers all over the world to smash all the aggressive conspiracies and war plans of US imperialism, and strive to build a new China and defend the lasting peace and democracy of the world!
All-China Federation of Trade Unions, August 19th

Our Newspaper Special Dispatch: After US imperialism published the "White Paper", exposing its consistent crimes and conspiracies of being an enemy of the Chinese people, the people of the whole country were filled with indignation. Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Liang Xi, an agricultural expert, Qian Sanqiang, a natural scientist and nuclear physicist, Xu Guangping, Vice-Chairman of the National Democratic Women's Federation, Li Wenyi, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Democratic Women's Federation, and one of the people in charge of the Preparatory Committee of the National Conference of Educational Workers, successively made speeches, unanimously condemning the evil deeds of US imperialism. The speeches are as follows:

Qian Junrui
The Chinese people can only continue to fight resolutely and consolidate Sino-Soviet friendship to achieve liberation
The US State Department's 1,054-page White Paper on Sino-US relations is the long, stinking confession of US imperialism. The Chinese and the people of the world can use this series of ironclad evidence confessed by the US imperialists themselves to further deepen their understanding of the evil system of imperialism and strengthen their just struggle against this evil system. But the US White Paper is not only a long confession, but also a total exposure of a new major conspiracy. After the failure of his extremely poor lackeys like Chiang Kai-shek, the US imperialists tried every means to grab the "liberal intellectuals" in China, the so-called "individual democrats", as a new pillar for their continued aggression against China. For this purpose, it desperately praised these elements as the "backbone of Chinese democracy"; and then picked up a so-called "red imperialism" weapon from the pitiful arsenal of Hitler and Tojo, taught them to oppose the Chinese Communist Party "serving the interests of foreign imperialism" at home, and to oppose the "red imperialism" fabricated by the US imperialists, namely the socialist Soviet Union, internationally. But all historical facts, especially the US White Paper itself, have taught the entire Chinese people, including the so-called "individual democrats": the Chinese people can only continue to resolutely oppose US imperialism and its lackeys in China, only resolutely follow the Chinese Communist Party, and establish the closest and most solid friendship with the Soviet Union, China's most reliable and loyal great ally, can finally let the US imperialists take 10,000 or 100,000 pages of White Papers into their thin coffins, and achieve the liberation of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

Liang Xi
US Imperialism's sabotage and disruption conspiracy
Chairman Mao had foreseen it long ago
Chairman Mao said in the Preparatory Meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference: "The imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their failure in China. They will still collude with each other and use all possible methods to oppose the Chinese people." What method will they use? Chairman Mao had also predicted that the first method is to "send their running dogs to infiltrate into China to carry out disintegration work and disruption work." The second method is to "instigate the Chinese reactionaries, and even add their own strength, to blockade China's seaports." The third method is to "send a part of their troops to harass China's borders." Now, except for the third method that has not yet been implemented, US imperialism has repeatedly used actions to prove the scientific prediction of China's great leader Chairman Mao. The trick of blockading seaports has already begun to be directed, needless to say. Recently, what kind of White Paper was published, exposing the imperialist conspiracy of using Chinese to control China, and vainly attempting to encourage some Chinese to oppose communism and oppose the Soviet Union, and overthrow the people's democratic regime under the leadership of the CCP. This regime, according to Acheson, is called a "foreign system", and these people who are encouraged are called "democratic individualists". Nonsense, said a lot. To put it bluntly, isn't it the "sending their running dogs to infiltrate into China to carry out disintegration and disruption work" that Chairman Mao said? Therefore, I think that the Chinese people not only don't need to refute these fallacies, but should also thank it. Why? Because of it, it proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's scientific prediction, and because of it, it shows the brilliance of Chairman Mao's knowledge.

The Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan was to fulfill the treaty, while the US's dropping of the atomic bomb was a political conspiracy.
Qian Sanqiang
The publication of the US White Paper has clarified many of our misconceptions and determined many of the attitudes we should adopt in the future. Today I just want to talk about one point, that is, the idea that "the atomic (nuclear) bomb defeated Japan, and the Soviet Union's participation in the war was to pick up the cheap". This kind of view was raised by people in many gatherings in Peiping and Tianjin. My answer at the time was based on the information I got in Europe: "At the Tehran Conference, Stalin and Roosevelt agreed that six months after the end of the European war, the Soviet Union would attack in the Far East to jointly defeat the enemy in the East. In the spring of 1945, at the Yalta Conference, Roosevelt saw that the European war was about to end, but according to the US Operations Department's estimates in the Far East, to defeat Japan and make it surrender through a landing plan, it would be necessary to lose 500,000 to 1 million American and Allied soldiers. From the American standpoint, this loss was unacceptable, so he eagerly hoped for the Soviet Union to participate in the war. Because Japan has its mainland plan, as long as it is not attacked by the east and west sides at the same time, even if the island is threatened, the government can move to the Northeast, relying on the strength of the Kwantung Army, and make a long-term resistance plan. But if the Soviet Union attacks from the west, the situation will be different. Therefore, in order to shorten the war and reduce the loss of America's "valuable" population, the Soviet Union must participate in the war. So at the meeting, Roosevelt asked Stalin with unease whether the Soviet Union still promised to abide by the Tehran promise? Stalin's answer was: The Soviet Union's military strength has increased greatly in the later period of the Patriotic War, so it does not need six months. Three months after the end of the European war, the Soviet Union can advance in the Far East.

"Now let's take a look at when Europe ended the war? The German army surrendered to the three Western countries in France on May 7, 1945, and surrendered to the Soviet Union in Berlin, Germany on May 9. If we take an average, it can be considered that it surrendered to the Allied countries on May 8. The Soviet Union's advance in the Northeast was on August 9. Judging from these two dates, the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to the Northeast was completely in compliance with the treaty of the Allied countries, and not to pick up the cheap after seeing that Japan was about to surrender.
The United States knew that the Soviet Union was going to send troops on August 8th and 9th, so it deliberately threw two bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6th and 9th, not before or after, with the atomic (nuclear) bomb that had just been successfully tested in June and July. What was its intention? According to the general inference of human nature and the conclusion of the Nobel Prize winner, British cosmic ray expert Blackett, this is a political conspiracy, hoping to reduce the value of the Soviet Union's participation in the war and attempt to monopolize the world after the war by threatening with the atomic (nuclear) bomb.

According to Professor Blackett's report, the United States had only built three atomic (nuclear) bombs at that time. If the Soviet Union does not participate in the war, Japan can still dream of a mainland plan. After the three bombs are dropped, if Japan does not surrender, can the United States end the East Asian war so quickly?
"Therefore, according to the above situation and analysis, we can say that the Soviet Union's participation in the war in East Asia was completely fulfilling the treaty, and not to pick up the cheap. It was the main reason for Japan's surrender. On the contrary, the US's dropping of the atomic (nuclear) bomb was a political conspiracy, at most it can be said that it accelerated the speed of Japan's surrender, giving the Japanese Emperor a way to step down."
Although many young people believe in my words, many people who are influenced by Kuomintang propaganda, or who have good relations with the United States and are confident that they have obtained more detailed information from the United States, believe that the evidence is not sufficient, especially the issue of dates. Now the reluctantly announced White Paper proves the decision of the Yalta Conference. This proves that the misconceptions obtained from professional rumor-mongers in the past should now be corrected. The American imperialists who have deceived us for so many years, and it is precisely its White Paper that has clarified these misconceptions for us, which we feel is fortunate.

Xu Guangping
Seriously examine our own lineup and review our respective strengths
Smash the conspiracy!
Since the US State Department published a White Paper entitled "Sino-US Relations" on the 5th of this month, newspapers and news agencies at home and abroad have reflected the opinions of people from all countries, which is generally considered to be a self-drawn confession. It can be used as a certificate to provide us with a small part of the information for clearing the poisonous harm that the US imperialists have added to China. From the perspective of the Chinese people, everything that the White Paper has madly babbled about has long been clear what it is all about, that is, their consistent established policy! Regardless of Marshall, Wedemeyer, Chennault, and Stuart, it is just a difference in techniques. As long as their regime is still in the hands of the ignorant and backed by the whip of Wall Street, it is impossible not to interfere in China's internal affairs. Every Chinese person except that group of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang "reactionary elements who are no different from the warlords of the past" has already seen it clearly. Therefore, since the start of the Liberation War in 1946, the People's Liberation Army has gained the support of the local people wherever it goes. In politics, the people's governments in various places are supported by the people, and the smooth convening of the Preparatory Meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference in June this year shows that whether in military or political terms, the entire Chinese people are united under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu to build a new republic of people's democratic dictatorship.

This great achievement has given the US imperialists a deep blow, making Acheson and others at a loss, and in confusion, they resigned and confessed that "the unfortunate result is beyond the control of the US government". It also said that "this result cannot be changed". It further admitted that "this is the product of internal forces in China, and the United States has tried to influence it, but it cannot be effective". This is indeed a true fact, and we are not surprised. We are only surprised that the US State Department knew it clearly before, but still dodged and refused to tell the truth, in order to deceive the international community and conceal the domestic situation. At this time, it turned the basket upside down, and presented the broken and crazy things that it thought were treasures to the people of the world for a thorough shame. It also frankly confessed their failure to all the American people. It was unexpectedly bold.
In fact, there is nothing unexpected. In the historical process of imperialism heading towards decline, when the time comes, it will naturally have to turn the pig's belly over to let everyone see it clearly. Since the people of the world understand it, the American aggressors still fantasize about using certain Chinese "democratic individualists" as their new tools, which is such a boring conspiracy! As the current facts show, can the Chinese people, who are increasingly powerful under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao in defeating the US imperialists and their reactionary groups, allow the organization of "anti-communist factions" to exist, and can they exist? However, we can take a warning from the White Paper, seriously examine our own lineup, review our respective strengths, strengthen unity, work hard to learn from the experience of the Soviet Union and new democratic countries in defeating the conspiracies of foreign invaders, firmly align ourselves with the Chinese Communist Party, and smash the new conspiracies of US imperialism, so that their dreams are "built on sand", and use this poisonous sting to break open the abscess that is about to fester. Our future is still unparalleled, and there is no doubt that it will be bright and powerful in the battle.

Unite under the banner of Chairman Mao and oppose the new conspiracy of US imperialist aggression
Li Wenyi
The US imperialists' publication of the White Paper on "Sino-US Relations" at this time is on the one hand to settle their old accounts of aggression against old China, and on the other hand to plan how to start with the new China. The US imperialists are anxious that they have lost a lot of money (US aid) in China and cannot recover the current goods (all the special rights of the US imperialists in China such as airspace, inland navigation, military bases, etc.). They are urgently calculating new methods, hoping to get back their old capital at once.

In the face of the power of the Chinese people, it is not easy to find a new method. It is beautifully called "equal commercial opportunities" to return the new China to the semi-colonial state of the old China and further colonize China. The "traditional friendship between China and the United States" and the huge amount of US aid are purely the compassion of a cat crying over a mouse, which the Chinese people have long experienced enough! The US imperialists' support for the Chiang government to fight the civil war does not know how many people's lives and property were swallowed up? I also don't know how many orphans and widows were left behind? The bloody lessons have made us more than 235 million women only strengthen our unity under the banner of Chairman Mao in the future, and continue to struggle with all the people against the new aggression of US imperialism.

The Chiang group, the old tool of the US imperialists, will soon be completely eliminated by the People's Liberation Army. He attempts to find "democratic individualists" to be his new tools to realize his great conspiracy to divide the unity of the Chinese people. We must further strengthen our unity and heighten our vigilance, so that his so-called "democratic individualists" will all be transformed into strong warriors in the collective democratic camp to smash all the new conspiracies of US imperialism. If there are shameless people who are willing to betray the people and become the US imperialist tools of aggression against China, the entire Chinese people will rise up and attack them.

Person in charge of the Preparatory Committee of the National Conference of Educational Workers:
The Chinese people must learn from the lessons and not fall into the US imperialist conspiracy trap
The White Paper on the China issue recently published by the US government is a "helpless confession", a "failed history of US imperialist conspiracy to destroy China", and at the same time a confession that the US imperialists still want to use all conspiracies and tricks to undermine the construction of a democratic and peaceful new China by the Chinese people.
For many years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have won a decisive victory in the cruel struggle with US imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, using the domestic forces organized by the people themselves, which even the US White Paper cannot but confirm. But the Chinese people will also learn from the White Paper of the US imperialists' great deception and great lies the following educational lessons, and we, the colleagues in the national education circle, should use these lessons to alert ourselves and educate the people of the country.

First, US imperialism has always assisted Chinese reactionaries to undermine the lives of the Chinese people in order to achieve its goal of invading and controlling China. In the past, it unreasonably aided a reactionary government and reactionary army that were completely unsupported by the people to attack the Chinese people who refused to support reactionary rule; now, it still wants to encourage, in every feasible way, the activities of those puppet elements who can promote China's becoming a US colony; in the future, it will continue to instigate various colonial governments in Southeast Asia and force the United Nations to oppose any foreign country aiding China in an equal and friendly manner. Therefore, in action, the Chinese people must only work harder, be more resolute, and more quickly and effectively completely wipe out the remaining forces of the Chinese reactionaries, and thoroughly defeat the imperialists, so that the imperialists can no longer play a role in China in the slightest, and our Chinese people can be considered to have achieved a complete victory.

Second, the only thing that US imperialism hopes to be able to utilize and drive in the future is some so-called "democratic individualists" who have been quite influenced by the US imperialist pseudo-freedom and pseudo-democracy. It attempts to encourage these "individualists" to replace Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, Yan Xishan, etc. to act as running dogs of the US imperialists, serve the Wall Street tycoons, and oppose the new life of the Chinese people. Therefore, in terms of ideology, the Chinese people must not be influenced by imperialism in any way, and must not fall into any trap of imperialism. First of all, there should be no so-called "democratic individualism" at all, and we should fundamentally oppose selfish and self-interested "individualism". Our Chinese people have learned Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and have defeated Japanese and US imperialism and its running dogs. In the future, we must use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to restore and develop production and cultural education, so that our people can live a prosperous and happy life. What we want to promote and carry forward is the new democracy, which is the people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and it is definitely not the US imperialist hypocritical, deceiving people, and serving the interests of monopoly capital so-called "democratic individualism".

Third, the 1,054-page thick-skinned and shameless White Paper slanders the Chinese people's revolutionary war against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism as "serving the interests of foreign imperialism", and falsely accuses the Soviet Union, which has truly not interfered in China's internal affairs, as a "foreign invasion". This kind of nonsense of reversing black and white and "the thief shouting stop thief" will surely be spurned by the Chinese people and the peace-loving and democratic people of the world. On the contrary, our Chinese people will definitely achieve closer and more friendly cooperation with the Soviet people and their government, who treat me completely equally, in order to oppose imperialism and war-mongers. At the same time, we will also definitely seek friendship with the American people to oppose the imperialists' undermining of the feelings between the Chinese and American people.

　　各界愤慨斥责美帝白皮书
    中华全国总工会
  　不管美帝侵华方式如何巧妙中国工人阶级决不会上当
    【新华社北平十九日电】中华全国总工会今日发表书面声明，严斥美国务院发表的白皮书。声明全文如下：
    美帝国主义对华政策，不管在他所发表的白皮书中，如何的掩饰歪曲，不论它采取什么样的形式，它的目的只有一个，就是把中国变为美帝国主义的殖民地。中国工人阶级，中国的广大人民，永远不会忘记，当日寇疯狂侵略中国时，输送大量钢铁、汽油、军火帮助日寇屠杀中国人民的，不是别国，正是美帝国主义。日寇投降后，派了飞机、兵舰积极帮助蒋匪运输军队到东北、华北、华东、华中各解放区打内战的，不是别国，正是美帝国主义；赠送大批军火、金钱支持蒋匪扩大内战的，不是别国，也正是美帝国主义。因之，美帝国主义的对华侵略政策，是与中国工人阶级及中国广大人民争取中国的独立自由民主和平统一的政策是不相容的。美帝国主义在华的侵略势力与中国工人阶级及广大人民的争取独立自由和平民主统一的势力是不能并存的。美帝国主义这次发表白皮书的一个重大阴谋，就是企图以此来挑拨中苏两国的兄弟友谊，与分散中国人民内部的团结，达到他反苏反中国人民的目的。中华全国总工会要正告美帝国主义者，你们这个算盘又打错了。中国工人阶级及中国广大人民深知苏联自从它立国以来，就是中国工人阶级及中国人民争取解放的最好的朋友；中国人民只有团结在一起反对美帝国主义的侵略，才能求得自己的独立自由和平民主与统一。因此，不管美帝国主义对中国的侵略政策采取如何巧妙的方式，中国工人阶级是决不会上当的。当中国工人阶级一登上中国的政治舞台，就高举反对帝国主义的鲜明旗帜，在自己先锋队——中国共产党领导下与帝国主义英勇战斗了将近三十年，在今天已强大到有足够的力量团结全国人民，把美帝国主义在中国的残余势力肃清。中华全国总工会所领导的中国工人阶级对付美帝国主义的政策也只有一个，那就是进一步团结自己、团结人民，在以苏联工人阶级为首的世界工联的领导下与全世界的阶级兄弟一起粉碎美帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋与战争计划，为建设新中国，为保卫世界的持久和平与民主而奋斗！
  　　　　　　　　　中华全国总工会　八月十九日
    【本报特讯】美帝发表“白皮书”，供出它一贯与中国人民为敌的罪行和阴谋以后，全国人民愤慨万分。中苏友好协会筹委会总干事钱俊瑞、农业专家梁希、自然科学工作者原子核物理学家钱三强、全国民主妇联副主席许广平、全国民主妇联常委李文宜、全国教育工作者代表会议筹备委员会负责人之一相继发表谈话，一致对美帝的罪恶行为痛予斥责。谈话如下：
    钱俊瑞
  　中国人民只有继续坚决斗争巩固中苏友谊才能获得解放
    美国国务院关于中美关系的长达一千零五十四页的白皮书，是美帝国主义又臭又长的供状。中国和全世界人民可以凭着美帝国主义者所自己招认的这一连串铁案如山的罪状，来更加加深自己对帝国主义这一罪恶制度的了解，并加强自己对这一罪恶制度的正义斗争。但美国白皮书不仅是一个长供状，而且是一个新的大阴谋的总暴露。美帝国主义者千思万想，在他的太不象样的走狗蒋介石辈失败之后，企图抓住中国的“自由主义分子”，即所谓“个人的民主主义者”，作为它继续侵略中国的新的支柱。为此目的，它就拼命捧场，称这些分子为中国“民主政治的脊骨”；再从希特勒东条的可怜的武库中捡出一件所谓“赤色帝国主义”的武器，传授给他们，要他们在国内反对“为外国帝国主义利益而效力”的中国共产党，在国际上要反对美帝国主义者所凭空捏造的“赤色帝国主义”，即社会主义苏联。但是一切历史事实，特别是美国白皮书本身，却教育了全中国人民，其中包括所谓“个人的民主主义者”在内：中国人只有继续坚决地反对美帝国主义及其在中国的走狗，只有坚决地跟着中国共产党走，并与中国人民最可靠最忠实的伟大友邦苏联建立最亲密最巩固的友谊，才能最后地让美帝国主义者带着一万页或十万页的白皮书钻入它的薄皮棺材，而获得中国人民和全世界人民的解放。
    梁希
  　美帝破坏捣乱阴谋
    毛主席早有预见
    毛主席在新政治协商会议筹备会中讲过：“帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的。他们还会要互相勾结在一起，用各种可能的方法，反对中国人民”。用什么方法呢？毛主席也曾经豫料过，说：第一法是“派遣他们的走狗，钻进中国内部来进行分化工作和捣乱工作”。第二法是“唆使中国反动派，甚至加上他们自己的力量，封锁中国的海港”。第三法是“派出一部分兵力侵扰中国的边境”。现在，除了第三法尚未实行外，美帝国主义一次又一次地用行动来证实中国伟大领袖毛主席的科学预言。封锁海港的把戏，已经开始导演，不必说了。最近又发表了什么白皮书，暴露出帝国主义以华制华的阴谋，妄想鼓励某些中国人来反共反苏，推翻中共领导下的人民民主政权。这个政权，照艾奇逊的说法，叫做“外来制度”，这些被鼓励的人，叫做“民主个人主义者”。胡言乱语，说了一大堆。拆穿了说，还不是毛主席所说“派遣他们的走狗，钻进中国内部来进行分化和捣乱工作”？所以，我以为中国人民非但不值得驳斥这些谰言，还应该感谢它。为什么？因为有了它，才证明毛主席科学预言的正确，有了它，才显出毛主席见识的英明。
    苏联对日参战是履行条约，美帝投原子弹则是一种政治阴谋。
  　钱三强
    美国白皮书的发表，使我们澄清了许多错误观念，及确定了许多今后我们所应采取的态度。今天我只想谈一点，即是“原子（核）弹打败了日本，苏联参战是来检便宜的”的观念。这类看法在平津好多次的集会中被人提出，我当时的回答是根据我在欧洲时得到的消息说：“在德黑兰会议中，斯大林与罗斯福商定，欧洲战局结束后六个月，苏联在远东进攻，共同击败东方的敌人。一九四五年春天雅尔达会议，罗斯福看到欧洲战事将要结束，但根据远东方面的美国作战部的估计，要从登陆计划打算，击败日本使它投降，必须要损失美国及联盟国的五十万到一百万的兵士。从美国人的立场来看，这个损失是不能接受的，因此极力盼望苏联参战。因为日本有它的大陆计划，只要东西两边不同时受攻击，既使本岛受到威胁，政府等尚可搬到东北，依靠关东军的兵力，作长期抵抗计划。但是假使苏联从西方进攻，情形即不同了。因此为缩短战事及减少美国“值钱的”人口损失起见，必须苏联参战。所以在会议中罗斯福怀着不安的情绪问斯大林，苏联是否还答应遵守德黑兰的允诺？斯大林的回答是：苏联的军力在爱国战争后期已经增强甚多，所以不需要六个月了，欧洲战局结束后的三个月，苏联即可在远东进兵。
    “现在看一看欧洲是什么时候结束战争的？德军于一九四五年五月七日在法国境内向西方三个国家投降，五月九日在德国柏林向苏联投降，若取一平均数，可以认为是五月八日向联盟国投降。苏联在东北进兵是八月九日。由这两个日期看来，苏联在东北出兵完全是遵守联盟国的条约，而不是看见日本要投降而来检便宜的。
    美国知道苏联要在八月八、九日出兵，故意将六、七月刚刚试验成功的原子（核）弹，不前不后的于八月六日与九日在广岛与长崎扔了两颗弹。它的用意是什么？根据一般的人情的推论及诺贝尔奖金获得者英国宇宙线专家布拉克特的结论，这是一个政治阴谋，希望借此减少苏联参战的价值及企图在战后借原子（核）弹的威胁，独占全世界。
    根据布拉克特教授的报告，在那时美国只造好了三枚原子（核）弹。假如苏联不参战，日本还可以作大陆计划的梦想。三枚弹投完以后，日本不投降，美国是否能这样快的结束东亚战争？
    “因此根据以上的情况与分析，我们可以说苏联在东亚参战是完全履行条约，并不是来检便宜的。它是日本投降的主要原因。相反地，美国的投原子（核）弹是一种政治阴谋，最多可以说它加快了日本投降的速度，给日本天皇一个下台阶的路。”
    我的话虽然有相当多的青年相信，但有许多受国民党宣传影响深的人，或者与美国有良好的关系而自信自美国得到更详细情报的人，都认为证据不够充足，特别是日期的问题。现在无可奈何而公布的白皮书，证明了雅尔达会议的决定。这证明了从前由职业造谣家所得的错误观念现在应该改正了。欺骗了我们多少年的美国帝国主义者，而偏偏又是它的白皮书，使我们澄清了这些错误观念，这是我们感觉可庆幸的事。

  　严肃自己阵容检讨各自力量
  　粉碎阴谋！
    自从美国国务院在本月五日发表了名为“中美关系”的白皮书之后，中外报纸通讯社纷纷反映了各国人士的意见，大致认为是自画的供状。可以作为供给我们清算美帝所加于中国毒害的一小部分资料的凭证的。在白皮书所狂吠的一切，从中国人民看来，早就明白是什么一回事儿，这就是它们一贯的既定政策！不管马歇尔、魏德迈、陈纳德、司徒雷登，不过手法上的不同罢了。只要它们的政权仍然操在黔武者的手里，背负着华尔街的鞭策，不干涉中国内政就是不可能的。除了那一群蒋介石的国民党“与过去军阀并无区别的反动分子”之外的每一个中国人，都早已看得明明白白。所以自从一九四六年解放战争发动之后，解放军所到之处，就获得当地人民的支持。在政治上，各地人民政府的为人民所拥护，以及今年六月新政协筹备会的顺利召开，都显现出无论在军事上，政治上，全中国人民都团结在中国共产党及毛主席朱总司令领导之下来建设新的人民民主专政的共和国。
    这一伟大的成就给予美帝国主义者以深重的打击，使艾奇逊们彷徨失措，在昏惑迷乱中卸辞自承“不幸结果为美国政府控制所不及”。又说“不能改变这个结果”。更承认“这是中国内部势力的产物，美国曾试图加以影响，但不能有效”。这倒是千真万确的事实，我们并不奇怪。只奇怪美国国务院以前明白知道而还要躲躲闪闪，不肯吐实，以欺骗国际，遮瞒国内。这时却倒翻转了篮底，把破破烂烂的疯子似的自以为宝贝的，呈献给全世界人们看个透顶丢人罢了。更是向所有美国人民都坦白出来它们的失败罢了。却是大胆得出乎意外。
    其实也没有什么意外的。在走向没落了的帝国主义的历史过程，时候到了自然不由得不翻转猪肚给大家看个明白。既然世界人都明白了，美国侵略者却还幻想利用某些中国的“民主的个人主义者”作他的新工具，是多么无聊的阴谋呀！照目前事实所显明，中国人民在战胜美帝及其反动集团，在中国共产党及毛主席领导日益强大之下，反而会容许“反共派别”的组织，而且能够存在吗？不过我们从白皮书倒可以警惕一下，严肃自己阵容，检讨各自力量，加紧团结，努力学习苏联及新民主国家战胜外来侵略者阴谋的经验，坚决向中国共产党靠拢，来粉碎美帝国主义者新的阴谋，使它们的梦想“建立在沙上”，有力地运用这支毒刺去挑破那即将溃烂的脓疮。我们的前途还是无比地，在战斗中，光明而且强大是无疑的。
    团结在毛主席旗帜下反对美帝侵略新阴谋
  　李文宜
    美帝在这时发表“中美关系”的白皮书，一方面清算他侵略旧中国的旧帐，而又打算在新中国如何下手。美帝焦虑着他在中国亏折了一大堆血本（美援）而无法可以收回现货（美帝在华的一切特权如领空、内航、军事基地等）。正急于盘算新办法，希望一下捞回老本。
    在中国人民的力量面前，想找出一个新办法，美其名为“商业机会均等”，要把新中国回到旧中国半殖民地的状态中去，进一步把中国殖民地化，这个新办法很不容易找了。“中美传统的友谊”，巨量的美援，纯是猫儿哭老鼠的慈悲，中国人民早已领教够了！美帝支持蒋政府打内战，就不知吞噬了多少人民的身命财产？亦不知遗留下多少孤儿寡妇？血腥的教训，已使我们二万万三千五百多万妇女，今后只有坚强地团结在毛主席旗帜之下，和一切的人民共同为反美帝新侵略而继续斗争了。
    美帝旧工具的蒋集团，不久将被人民解放军彻底消灭了，他企图找“民主个人主义者”做他的新工具，以实现其分化中国人民团结的大阴谋。我们更要加紧团结，提高警觉，使他所谓“民主个人主义者”，都改造成为集体民主阵营中的坚强的战士，以粉碎美帝一切新阴谋。如有无耻之徒，甘愿背叛人民，去当美帝的侵华工具，全中国人民将群起而攻之。

    中国人民要吸取教训不落美帝的阴谋圈套
    美国政府最近所发表的关于中国问题的白皮书，是一篇“无可奈何的供状”，是一本“美帝阴谋亡华的失败史”，同时又是美帝还要用一切阴谋诡计来破坏中国人民建设民主和平的新中国的自白书。
    中国人民多年来在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，用人民自己组织起来的国内势力，在和美国帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石反动集团的残酷斗争中，赢得了决定的胜利，这即使是美国的白皮书也不能不加以证实的。但中国人民又将从美帝的大欺骗大撒谎的白皮书中，吸取下述富有教育意义的教训，我们全国教育界同人应该以这些教训来警惕自己，并教育国人。
    第一、美国帝国主义是始终援助中国反动派来破坏中国人民的生活，以达其侵略中国，控制中国的目的的。过去，它毫无理由地援助一个完全不受人民支持的反动政府和反动军队，来进攻拒绝支持反动统治的中国人民；现在，它还是要以每一可行的途径，鼓励凡能促使中国成为美国殖民地的傀儡分子的活动；将来，更要继续嗾使东南亚各殖民政府及强迫联合国，反对任何外国以平等友好的态度援助中国。因此，中国人民在行动上，只有更加努力，更加坚决，更加迅速有效地彻底扫灭中国反动派的残余势力，将帝国主义者彻底打败，使帝国主义再不能在中国起一丝一毫的作用，我们中国人民才算是取得了彻底的胜利。
    第二、美国帝国主义今后唯一所希望能够供其利用和驱使的，是一些曾经相当受到美帝伪自由伪民主的影响的所谓“民主的个人主义者”。它企图鼓励这些“个人主义者”来代替蒋介石、李宗仁、阎锡山等充当美帝的走狗，为华尔街大亨们效力，以反对中国人民的新生。因此，中国人民在思想上，就必须不受帝国主义的任何影响，不落帝国主义的任何圈套，首先就根本不要所谓“民主的个人主义”，根本反对自私自利的“个人主义”。我们中国人民学到了马列主义和毛泽东思想，战胜了日美帝国主义及其走狗，今后就必须用马列主义和毛泽东思想来恢复和发展生产和文化教育，使我们全国人民过着富强康乐的生活。我们所要发扬光大的是新民主主义，是以无产阶级为领导，以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，而决不是美国帝国主义的虚伪的，欺骗人们，服从独占资本利益的所谓“民主的个人主义”。
    第三、一千零五十四页的厚颜无耻的白皮书，对中国人民反帝反封建反官僚资本主义的革命战争，诬为“为外国帝国主义利益而效力，而把真正没有干涉中国内政的苏联诬为“外来的侵略”，这种颠倒黑白，“贼喊捉贼”的谰言，必为全中国及全世界爱好和平民主的人民所不齿。恰恰相反，我们中国人民今后必将与完全以平等待我的苏联人民及其政府取得更亲密的友好合作，以反对帝国主义及战争贩子。同时也必将与美国人民讲求友谊，以反对帝国主义者破坏中美两国人民的感情。
