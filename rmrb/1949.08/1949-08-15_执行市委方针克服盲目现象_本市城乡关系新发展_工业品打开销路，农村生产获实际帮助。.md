[This City News] In the half-year since liberation, the urban-rural relationship in Beiping has been built on the basis of mutual assistance, with the aim of developing industrial and agricultural production. Over the past six months, various sectors, both public and private, have used various institutions and forms to connect urban and rural trade, enabling the exchange of industrial and agricultural products, and beginning to change the past urban exploitation of the countryside, initially establishing a new urban-rural relationship.

In the early days of liberation, Beiping's trade relations were limited to nearby areas such as central Hebei, eastern Hebei, and Zhangjiakou. Now, they have been extended to Jilin, western Liaoning, eastern Liaoning, Suiyuan, Inner Mongolia, East China, and Central China. The scope of trade is no longer simply relying on the countryside to supply grain, but is able to export some agricultural tools, fertilizers, and industrial products. In addition to grain and daily necessities, imports also include mountain products, furs, bristles, timber, silk, and other transit goods. In addition to the original trading companies and supply and marketing cooperatives, there are also trade guidance committees, farmers' reception centers, grain and cargo yards, and Yumin mountain goods yards. In addition, investigation teams were organized to investigate the production and sales of various industries in various regions and in the city.

In the work of connecting urban and rural trade, a period of exploration was experienced. Between February and May, there was a blind phenomenon in the city's industrial production. For example, the soap industry initially supported by the trading company (some of which were started by industrialists and businessmen themselves) experienced overproduction due to a lack of market needs survey. The supported towels and socks were also difficult to sell, making it impossible for funds to circulate. During this stage, not only was it unfavorable to the development of urban industry, but also provided little practical help to rural production. The city could not supply farmers with a large amount of production materials, but relied on the countryside for a large supply of grain. (Of course, in the early days of Beiping's liberation, it was necessary and unavoidable for the countryside to support the newly liberated Beiping with a large amount of grain.) This urban-rural relationship, to a certain extent, presented a one-sided phenomenon of the countryside supporting the city.

**Industrial Exhibition Leads to a Surge in Exports and Imports**

In June, the CCP Beiping Municipal Committee announced the "Decision on the Current Central Tasks of Beiping City," which, based on Chairman Mao's policy of "considering all aspects", clarified the specific guidelines for urban-rural mutual assistance. The focus of this policy on developing urban production is to first restore and develop all industries and transportation that can export to the countryside and supply citizens with beneficial national livelihoods, and all commerce that is conducive to production recovery and development. Based on this policy, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce held an industrial exhibition, which played a significant role in connecting urban and rural relations. In order to make various regions understand the industrial products of Beiping, the government specially invited more than 130 people from the industrial and commercial sectors (including personnel from industry, commerce, trade, cooperation, and enterprises, as well as private industrialists) from western Liaoning, Jinzhou, Shandong, Jinan, Suiyuan-Mongolia, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, eastern Hebei, Zhangjiakou, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang to visit Beiping. The Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, trading companies, and the enterprise bureau held various symposiums with them to understand each other's situations and widely exchange views on material exchange. For example, the Jinan delegation pointed out that they currently needed Beiping's cement and dye raw materials, as well as steel pipes from Shijingshan. Through this exhibition and multiple symposiums, not only was the market needs of various regions generally understood, but the trading company further concluded deals with Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Taiyue, Chahar, Tangshan, and other places for goods worth a total of 160 million yuan (calculated at June prices), and began to establish relations with various regions for the exchange of materials. After the industrial exhibition, the number of people coming to Beiping to exchange materials gradually increased, and urban-rural trade made significant progress. The role played by the industrial exhibition in the exchange of urban and rural materials can be seen from the following comparison table of major goods coming and going: (See table below)

| Category | Before Industrial Exhibition (April 16 - June 5) | After Industrial Exhibition (June 6 - July 27) | Percentage Increase After Industrial Exhibition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Various Cloth | Outward: 9,769 bolts | 50,894 bolts | 421 |
| Grain | Inward: 1,129,000 catties | 3,990,000 catties |  |
|  | Outward: 2,251,000 catties |  | 462 |
| Knitwear | Outward: 3,268 dozens | 66,218 dozens | 1920 |
| Ready-made Clothes | Outward: None | 14,300 pieces |  |
| Matches | Outward: 337 boxes | 3,501 boxes | 933 |
| White Sugar | Inward: None | 600,000 catties |  |
| Alpaca Wool | Inward: None | 666,191 catties |  |
| Timber | Inward: None | 1,000 cubic feet |  |

Before the industrial exhibition, the exchange areas were only central Hebei, eastern Hebei, Suiyuan-Mongolia, Chahar Province, Bohai, Inner Mongolia, and the Northwest. After the industrial exhibition, Taiyue, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Shimen, western Liaoning, Jilin, Andong, and Gui Sui were added.

**Organizing Public and Private Industrial and Commercial Personnel to Go to the Countryside for Investigation and Procurement**

In addition to this, in order to further understand the foreign market, in late June, the Municipal Trading Company and the Trade Guidance Committee organized two investigation teams to the Northeast and Northwest to conduct various investigations related to urban and rural trade. This investigation raised and resolved some issues hindering urban and rural trade: such as reducing agricultural product taxes, abolishing tax cards at various city gates, and railway joint transportation. The investigation by various groups revealed that Beiping's cotton cloth, socks, towels, and even cigarettes and soap, if the cost is low, the quality is high, and the specifications are up to standard, can still find a market. However, in order to find a fixed market, in addition to state-owned commerce, it is also necessary to mobilize private merchants to directly inspect the market. The recent organization of industrial capitalists by the Municipal Trade Guidance Committee to visit the countryside is to meet this requirement. Currently, more than 30 units from the machinery industry, weaving and dyeing industry, cigarette industry, carpet industry, soap making industry, leather making industry, and flour industry have participated, and they plan to depart for the Northeast and Northwest in mid-month. Many industrialists believe that this trip will be of great help to the future development of industry and commerce, especially private enterprises.

At present, in the work of breaking down the long-term isolated and antagonistic urban-rural relationship, it is possible and necessary to unite and organize private merchants, and use their experience, relationships, and funds to establish a new urban-rural mutual assistance relationship. Based on this requirement, the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee has organized merchants from the grain store, rice and flour, and machine-made flour industries to go to the countryside together with the trading company to purchase wheat. In the process of public-private cooperation, private merchants not only obtain legitimate profits, but also benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood, which makes them gradually eliminate their concerns about not understanding the policy.

**Supply and Marketing Cooperative Loans Salt and Fertilizer in Exchange for Rural Mountain Products and Local Products**

The Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative has played a significant role in urban-rural mutual assistance. The mountainous area of Pingxi, Yanging, is rich in mountain products, but sales are not strong, while farmers in the area lack edible salt. The Ping Municipality Supply and Marketing Cooperative immediately organized county cooperatives to lend 300,000 catties of edible salt to mountain farmers from the Changlu Salt Company, stipulating that they would be repaid with mountain products or chicken eggs in the autumn. This solved the difficulty of edible salt in the mountainous area and helped promote the sale of local products in the mountainous area, which won the welcome of farmers. In addition, in order to solve the problem of the sale of accumulated manure in the city and the difficulty of fertilization in the countryside, the cooperative loaned more than 2.6 million catties of manure to farmers in Pingjiao and Liangxiang and other places along the Pinghan Line.

In short, Beiping's urban-rural trade has gradually expanded, the idea of urban-rural mutual assistance has become increasingly clear, and the experience gained has pointed out the direction for future urban-rural trade work:

**Future Paths**

(1) In order to restore and develop Beiping's industrial production, public and private industry and commerce must face the countryside, produce industrial products urgently needed by the countryside, and transport and sell various agricultural and sideline products that farmers urgently need to sell. Only in this way can the problem of raw materials and sales of urban industrial production be solved, and only in this way can agricultural production be improved, farmers' purchasing power be increased, and conditions be created for improving industrial production. The North China Water Conservancy Promotion Agency recently ordered more than 1,500 waterwheels in Beiping (undertaken by 20 iron factories such as Cixing and Dazhong), and rural areas such as Liangxiang, Fangshan, and the suburbs of Beiping have successively ordered them, indicating that industrial supply of farmers' production materials is not only serving the countryside, but also expanding the industrial market. In terms of daily necessities, it is also necessary to meet the needs of farmers. For example, fabrics such as broadcloth and patterned cloth have been ignored since liberation, while fabrics such as striped cloth, white cloth, and colored cloth that meet the needs of farmers are selling well. However, facing the countryside, we should first understand the situation of the rural market. Therefore, it is very necessary for industrialists and businessmen to go to the countryside. This is the only way to solve the raw material sales problem of industry.

(2) To connect urban and rural trade, in terms of cities, we must develop state-owned commerce and systematically and steadily establish mass-based supply and marketing cooperatives with centralized leadership. But at the same time, we must overcome the idea of certain state-owned commerce fighting alone and handling everything, and encourage legitimate commerce to go to the countryside for procurement and provide them with active guidance. Therefore, the Trade Guidance Committee should have specific leadership guidelines for the city's commerce, especially industries that have close ties with urban and rural trade. At the same time, trading companies, cooperatives, banks, and private merchants in various industries should have appropriate division of labor and connection, combine with the industrial production plan to establish normal trade relations, organize promotion, absorb agricultural products or other mountain goods, and supply cities or transport them for export.

(3) Since our urban-rural relationship is based on urban-rural mutual assistance, the quality and price of products sold from cities to other places must be paid attention to. The main problems of Beiping's current industrial products are low quality, non-standard specifications, high cost, and not paying attention to packaging, which affects sales. Efforts should be made to improve, overcome the style of shoddy work, and strive to reduce costs. Only in this way can Beiping's industrial production further meet the requirements of farmers, and its sales can be further developed.

    执行市委方针克服盲目现象
    本市城乡关系新发展
    工业品打开销路，农村生产获实际帮助。
    【本市讯】解放半年来的北平城乡关系，是建筑在城乡互助的基础上，以发展工业及农业生产为目的的。半年来它通过公私各方面，利用各种机构和形式，沟通城乡贸易，使工、农业产品互相交流，开始改变着过去的城市剥削乡村，初步建立起新的城乡关系。
    解放初期，和北平发生贸易关系的只有附近的冀中、冀东、张家口等地，现在已推广到吉林、辽西、辽东、绥远、内蒙、华东、华中等地。贸易范围，已不是单纯依靠乡村供给粮食，而能输出一部分农具、肥料、工业产品等。输入除粮食日用品外，还有山货、皮毛、猪鬃、木材、蚕丝等一些转口物资。办理城乡贸易的机构，除原有的贸易公司、供销合作总社外，尚有贸易指导委员会、农民招待所、粮货栈、裕民山货栈等。此外，还组织了到各地区和在本市调查各业产销情况的调查小组。
    在沟通城乡贸易工作中，是经过一段摸索过程的，在二月至五月间，本市工业生产，曾存在着盲目现象，如贸易公司开头扶植的肥皂业（有些是工商业者自己搞起来的），因未调查市场需要而发生生产过剩，被扶植的毛巾、袜子，也因此而很难销售，使得资金无法周转。在这一阶段中，不但对城内工业发展无利，而且对农村生产也很少实际帮助，城市不能大量供给农民生产资料，却仰赖农村大量粮食之供应，（当然，在北平刚刚解放之初，农村以大量粮食支援新解放的北平，是必要的，也是不可免的。），这种城乡关系，在一定程度上，呈现了片面的农村支持城市的现象。
  工业展览以后输出输入激增
    六月间，中共北平市委会公布的北平市目前中心工作的决定中，根据毛主席四面八方政策，明确了城乡互助的具体方针，这方针在发展城市生产的重点上，首先是恢复与发展一切可以向农村输出和供给市民的有益国民生计的工业、运输业，和一切有利生产恢复与发展的商业。根据这一方针，市工商局举行了一次工业展览会，对沟通城乡关系起很大的推动作用。为了使各地了解北平市的工业产品，政府特邀请了辽西、锦州、山东、济南、绥蒙、冀鲁豫、冀东、张家口、保定、石家庄等地工商界（其中有工商、贸易、合作、企业等人员及私营工业家）一百三十余人来平参观。市工商局、贸易公司、企业局分别和他们开了各种座谈会，相互了解情况，并广泛交换了有关物资交流的意见。如济南代表团提出目前正需要北平的水泥和染料原料及石景山的钢管。通过这次展览和多次座谈，不但一般的了解了各地市场需要，贸易公司更进一步和冀鲁豫、太岳、察哈尔、唐山等地成交总值一亿六千万元（按六月份合价）的货物，开始建立了与各地交换物资的关系。工展以后，各地来平交换物资的便日渐增加，城乡贸易有了显著的进展。由下列主要货物来去货的比较表里可以看出工展会在城乡物资交流上所起的作用：（见下表）类别      工展前（四月十六日至六月五日）
              工展后（六月六日至七月二十七日）工展后增加的百分比各种布疋  去货  九、七六九匹  五○、八九四匹  四二一布疋食粮  来货  一、一二九、○○○  三、九九○、○○○斤斤
      去货  二、二五一、○○○斤
      四六二针织品  去货三、二六八打  六六、二一八打  一九二○成衣  去货  无  一四、三○○件火柴  去货  三三七箱  三、五○一箱  九三三红白糖  来货  无  六○○、○○○斤羊驼毛绒  来货  无  六六六、一九一斤木材  来货  无  一、○○○立方尺
    交换地区单位，工展前只是冀中、冀东、绥蒙、察省、渤海、内蒙、西北，工展后则增加了太岳、冀鲁豫、石门、辽西、吉林、安东、归绥等。
  组织公私工商人员
        下乡调查采购
    除此而外，为进一步了解外地市场，在六月下旬，市贸易公司和贸易指导委员会，又组织了东北、西北两个调查小组，前往各该地进行各项有关城乡贸易的调查，这一调查提出并解决了一些阻碍城乡贸易的问题：如减低农产品税收，取消各城门的税卡，及铁路联运等问题。各组调查中，知道了北平的棉布、袜子、毛巾以至纸烟、肥皂等日用品，如成本低、质量高、今规格，销路还是能打开的。但目前寻找固定市场，除公营商业外，还必须发动私商，直接到市场考察。最近市贸易指导委员会组织工业资本家下乡参观，就是适应这种要求进行的。现已参加者有机器业、织染业、卷烟业、地毯业、造胰业、制革业、面粉业等三十多单位，计划在本月中旬起程到东北、西北各地。许多工业家们都认为，此行对工商业发展的前途，将有很大助益，尤其是私营企业。
    目前，在打开长期隔绝对立的城乡关系的工作中，团结和组织私商，运用他们的经验、关系、资金等以求建立新的城乡互助关系，是可能也是必要的。市财经委员会根据这种要求，又组织了粮栈、米面粮、机制面粉三业商人和贸易公司共同下乡收购小麦，在公私合作过程中，私商既获得合法利润，又有利国计民生，这使得他们逐渐破除了对政策不了解的顾虑。
  供销总社贷盐贷肥  交换农村山货土产
    市供销合作总社在城乡互助上曾起了显著作用。平西山地延庆一带，盛产山货，但销路不旺，而该地农民缺乏食盐，平市供销总社当即组织县合作社由长芦盐公司将三十万斤食盐，贷给山区农民，规定秋后以山货或鸡子偿还，这样解决了山区食盐困难，又帮助推销了山区的土产，博得农民欢迎。此外，为解决本市积粪的销路和农村施肥的困难，合作社又贷给平郊及平汉线良乡等地农民二百六十余万斤大粪。
    总之，北平的城乡贸易，业已逐渐展开，城乡互助的思想，已日益明确，摸索出来的经验，给我们指出了今后城乡贸易工作的方向：
  今后途径
    （一）为恢复与发展北平工业生产，公私工商业必须面向农村，生产农村所迫切需要的工业品，运销农民迫切需要出售的各种农业、副业产品，只有如此，才能解决城市工业生产的原料与销路问题，也只有如此，才能提高农业生产，才能提高农民购买力，为提高工业生产创造条件。华北水利推进社最近在北平订制的一千五百余辆水车（由慈型、大中等二十个铁工厂承做），良乡、房山、北平郊区等各地农村，都纷纷订购，这说明工业供给农民生产资料，不仅是为农村服务，同时也扩大了工业市场。在日用品方面，也要适合农民的需要，如派力司，剔花布等布匹，解放后无人问津，而条布、白布、色布等适合农民需要的布匹则销路日畅。不过，面向农村，应首先了解农村市场的情况，因此工商业家下乡是十分必要的，这是解决工业原料销路的唯一道路。
    （二）沟通城乡贸易，在城市方面，必须发展国营商业，并有计划地稳步地建立群众性的有集中领导的供销合作社。但同时必须克服国营商业中某些孤军作战、事事包办的思想，要鼓励正当的商业下乡采购，并对他们进行积极的指导。因此，贸易指导委员会应对全市商业，首先是对城乡贸易有密切关系的行业，要有具体的领导方针，同时贸易公司、合作社、银行、各业私商等应有适当的分工与连系，结合着工业生产的计划建立正常贸易关系，组织推销，吸收农产品或其他山货，供给城市或转运出口。
    （三）我们的城乡关系，既然建立在城乡互助的基础上，因此城市销往外地的产品，必须注意质量及价格。北平目前的工业产品，主要问题是质量低、不合规格、成本高、不注重装口而影响销路。应力求改进，克服粗制滥造作风，并在成本上力求减低。只有如此，北平的工业生产才能更进一步适应农民的要求，它的销路才能更进一步得到发展。
