Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 21st: TASS Moscow, August 20th: Rokotov, in the international commentary column of Pravda, wrote regarding the Soviet government's reply to the Yugoslav government's note on the Slovene Carinthia issue: The Soviet government's reply, which exposed the Tito group's treacherous two-faced policy, has been widely echoed around the world. The Soviet note fully exposes the Yugoslav government's treacherous policy of secret collusion with imperialism, deceiving the Yugoslav people, and opposing the Soviet Union. The Soviet note has dealt a very heavy blow to the Tito-Ranković group, making it impossible for them to hide behind a pretense of friendship with the Soviet Union to deceive the people and conduct shameful deals with imperialism behind the people's backs.

Viktorov wrote: The comments on the Soviet note in progressive newspapers around the world once again demonstrate the immense moral and political strength of the democratic and socialist camp, and its unity and shared destiny. Progressive people around the world are increasingly convinced that resolutely exposing all traitors who betray the interests of the people, and exposing all those who spread discord and hostility among nations, is essential to the cause of peace.

The author pointed out: Foreign capitalist newspapers, which previously considered it necessary to conceal the true relationship between the imperialist camp and the traitor Tito, are now openly admitting it because the deception has been exposed. Reactionary newspapers approvingly mentioned the fact that the Yugoslav ambassador to Washington immediately rushed to Acheson for instructions after receiving the Soviet note.

Viktorov concluded: The strength of the Soviet note's blow to the Tito group can be seen from the fact that Yugoslav newspapers have not mentioned the Soviet note at all so far. The Tito group's silence is because it is afraid to tell the truth to the Yugoslav people. The "conspiracy of silence" cannot save the vile traitors. The Yugoslav people will learn the truth about the traitorous clique: the traitors have become abject lackeys of imperialism and are dragging the country into the abyss of the Marshall Plan and the web of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

　　揭破铁托集团两面政策苏照会对和平贡献重大
    【新华社北平二十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：罗克托罗夫在真理报国际述评栏论及苏联政府对南斯拉夫政府关于斯洛文族加林西亚问题的照会之复文时写道：苏联政府揭露了铁托集团叛逆的两面政策的复文，在全世界得到广泛的回响。苏联的照会充分揭露了南斯拉夫政府与帝国主义秘密勾结、欺骗南斯拉夫人民和反苏的叛逆政策。苏联的照会给予铁托兰科维区集团以非常严重的打击，使它再不能隐蔽在假装的对苏友谊后面用以欺骗人民并在人民背后进行与帝国主义可耻买卖。
    维克托罗夫写道：全世界进步报纸对苏联照会的评论又一次显示了民主和社会主义阵营在道义上和政治上的巨大力量，及其团结一致与休戚相关。全世界进步人民正愈益坚信：坚决揭发背叛人民利益的一切叛徒，揭发一切在各民族间散布不和与敌意的人，对和平事业是多么必要。
    作者指出：外国资本家的报纸，它们从前认为掩饰帝国主义阵营与叛徒铁托之间的真实关系是必要的，现在则已毫不讳言了，因为欺骗已被揭破。反动报纸表示赞同地提到一项事实，即南斯拉夫驻华盛顿大使收到苏联照会之后，曾立即赶忙向艾奇逊请求指示。
    维克托罗夫结语称：苏联照会对铁托集团的打击的力量，从南斯拉夫报纸至今只字未提苏联照会这件事上可以表现出来。铁托集团的保持缄默，是因为它怕向南斯拉夫人民说出真象。“缄默的阴谋”援救不了卑劣的叛徒。南斯拉夫人民将得知叛变者集团的实情：叛变者已变成帝国主义奴颜婢膝的走狗，并且在把南国拖进马歇尔计划的深渊，拖进北大西洋集团的罗网。
