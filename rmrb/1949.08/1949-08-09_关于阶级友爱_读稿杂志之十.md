    On Class Friendship
    Reading Magazine No. 10
    Ya Qun

    In submitted articles, it is often mentioned how, upon first joining the revolutionary ranks, one felt that the veteran cadres were mostly "cold" and lacked enthusiasm towards comrades, which one was quite unaccustomed to, even looking down on these "old roughnecks." But over time, one felt that it was one's own "petty-bourgeois consciousness at work," discovering that the veteran cadres were indeed more steadfast in their stand and stronger in their principles. However, most failed to provide specific examples to illustrate how the veteran cadres' stand was steadfast and their principles were strong, leaving the reader unable to determine exactly what they had learned from the veteran cadres.

    Today, I read another long poem titled "Veteran Cadre," whose theme is also to explain how intellectual Party members initially did not understand the veteran cadres, and later deeply appreciated the veteran cadres' strength and greatness, enthusiastically praising them. The poem describes the process of the author's change in perspective as follows:

    When he first moved in, the veteran cadre was reading the newspaper, "without even turning his head, only saying: Hey, comrade, the room next door is yours." "When it was time to eat, there wasn't even a call." Thus, he felt that this veteran cadre "really had some bureaucratic airs, class friendship isn't even mentioned!" So, he "spent several days with a gloomy face." Later, he fell ill. In the morning, the veteran cadre, unaware, came to wake him, and he said, "I'm dizzy, I can't get up." The veteran cadre ran off without a word. He became even more angry, even wanting to go home for "warmth"! But before long, someone knocked on the door. The doctor arrived, and the veteran cadre brought "sugar and egg rice porridge," anxiously asking the doctor, "Is it serious? A fever? Can he eat anything oily?" This made him feel "electrified" with emotion, recognizing his error and "beginning to understand what class friendship is" in the veteran cadre. Later, he further learned that the cadre came from a working-class background and was "down-to-earth, burying himself in hard work," etc., but these are relatively abstract narratives and direct statements of his respect and love for the veteran cadre, lacking power.

    Although the author, after recognizing the veteran cadre's good qualities, severely scolded himself for liking "warmth," he overlooked that the key to his change in perception of the veteran cadre was still based on care in daily life. Ultimately, it still stems from a need for warmth. The previous dissatisfaction was due to a lack of warmth; the later emotion was because he more urgently needed "warmth" when he was sick. This unconscious contradictory emotional state is inevitable in young comrades and is not surprising, but it is not enough as a solution to a thought problem. The greatest class friendship and revolutionary enthusiasm are expressed in the resolute struggle against class enemies and in infinite loyalty to the revolutionary cause, not in daily life. Of course, a great and passionate revolutionary is also serious and conscientious about daily life, but the primary standard of seriousness and conscientiousness is still whether it conforms to revolutionary interests. If a person sees the interests of the great people's cause as something cold and ruthless, and regards trivial daily life as the determinant of everything, this precisely shows his lack of revolutionary enthusiasm, rather than being rich in revolutionary enthusiasm. Therefore, when we look at a comrade, whether it is an old cadre or a new cadre, we mainly want to see the extent of his concern for himself in politics, work, and thought. The forms expressed through class feelings may be patient guidance or severe criticism, but we ourselves should not pay more or complete attention to attitude and life details.

    Naturally, as a leading comrade, or oneself in relation to other comrades, in addition to helping others politically and in work, one should also be very concerned about them in life, that is, one should have the spirit of "bearing hardship before enjoying happiness" and "sharing the worries of the people," which is precisely the quality of a revolutionary. For example, the veteran cadre in this poem, although a bit careless in daily life details, is very good in that he carefully takes care of the young comrade when he discovers he is sick, which is also a concrete manifestation of class friendship. However, for a revolutionary, it is best to pay more attention to whether one has done enough to care for comrades, and not to pay too much attention to how others treat oneself, especially not to use this as the sole measure to judge people.

    If this poem had focused on deeply depicting the veteran cadre giving the young comrade clear and powerful enlightenment and education in one or two typical examples related to policy and thought issues, and giving the young comrade a powerful appeal in a spirit of arduous and simple work, so that he would change from dissatisfaction to emotion and then to respect and love, then it would have had power. We often say that the strength of a work's ideology lies here.

    关于阶级友爱
    读稿杂志之十
    亚群
    来稿中，常有谈到自己初到革命队伍中，如何感到老干部大都是“冷冰冰”的，对同志缺乏热情，颇为不惯，乃至瞧不起这些“老粗”，但久了，又觉得是自己“小资产阶级的意识在作怪”，发觉老干部确实比自己立场坚定，原则性强等等。但，大都没有举出具体的实例，以说明老干部的立场如何坚定，原则性如何强，使人读了不敢断定他究竟在老干部身上学得些什么。
    今天又读了一首长诗，题目是“老干部”，主题也同样是在说明知识分子的党员，起初如何不了解老干部，后来又如何深刻地体念到老干部的坚强、伟大，非常热情地歌颂老干部。描写他的观点改变的过程是这样的：
    他初搬去的时候，老干部正在看报，“连头也不回，只说：喂，同志，隔壁就是你的房间。”“吃饭了，招呼也不招呼一声”。于是，他感到这位老干部“真有些官僚作风，阶级友爱竟是不谈！”于是自己“愁眉苦脸的渡过了好几天”。后来自己病了，早上老干部不知道，来叫他起床，他说：“我头昏，起不来”，老干部一声不响就跑了，他于是更加生气，简直想回家去找“温暖”了！但不一会，有人搞门，医生来了，同时老干部送来了“糖和鸡子的大米粥”，并焦急地问医生：“不打紧吧？发烧了？吃得油不？”这才使得他“浑身象触了电”一样地感动，认识了自己的错误，并在老干部身上“开始懂得了什么是阶级友爱”。之后，更进一步知道了他原是工人出身，以及“脚踏实地，埋头苦干”等等，但这些都是比较抽象的叙述和直说自己对老干部的如何敬爱，没有什么力量。
    作者虽在认识了老干部的好处之后，痛痛地骂了一顿自己喜欢“温情”，可是，他忽略了他之对老干部观感转变的关键，仍然是建筑在生活上的关照的基础之上的。归根究底，还是从需要温情出发。前头的不满，是没有温情；后面的感动，是因为在自己病了的时候，更迫切需要“温情”。这种不自觉的矛盾的思想情绪，在青年同志中，自有其不可免的过程，不足为怪，但在作为解决一个思想问题来看，就不够了。最大的阶级友爱和革命热情，是表现在对阶级敌人的坚决斗争中，表现在对革命事业的无限忠心中，而不在于日常生活。当然，一个伟大的热情的革命家对于日常生活也是严肃认真的，但是严肃认真的首要标准仍然是是否符合于革命利益。如果一个人把伟大的人民事业的利益看成是冷酷无情的东西，把琐细的日常生活看成是决定一切的东西，这正是表明他的缺乏革命热情，而不是富有革命热情。因此，在我们看一个同志的时候，不管对老干部也好，新干部也好，我们主要是要看他对自己在政治上、工作上、思想上的关切程度何如？而透过阶级感情所表现的形式，也可能是耐心的诱导，也可能是严厉的批评，但我们自己不应更多地或完全注意态度和生活细节。
    自然，作为一个领导同志或自己对别的同志来说，除了从政治上工作上帮助别人外，同样在生活上亦应十分关切，即应具有“吃苦在前，享福在后”，和“人忧其忧”的精神，这正是一个革命者的品质。比如这诗中的老干部，在生活细节上虽然有些马虎，但当发觉他病了，便细密地关照，是很好的，也是阶级友爱的具体表现。但，这一条，在一个革命者，则最好是多注意自己对待同志是否做到了应有的关心，而不应多注意别人对待自己如何，尤其不要把这一条作为唯一的尺度去量人。
    这诗，假如把重点放在深刻地描写老干部在一二典型的、有关政策思想问题的事例当中，给了这位年青同志明确有力的启发和教育；在艰苦朴实的工作作风中，给了这位青年同志有力的感召；以致使得他由不满而转为感动，而敬爱，那就有力量了。我们常说一篇作品的思想性强不强，原因就在这里。
