    A Historical Account of Nanjing Journalists' Struggle for Democracy Under Kuomintang Rule
    Pu Xixiu
    Regarding the persecution and oppression suffered by progressive journalists in the Nanjing area under Kuomintang reactionary rule, and their struggle for the cause of democracy, I would like to describe the facts based on my personal experience. Nanjing was the capital of the puppet government, and the newspapers were naturally all controlled by the "official" families. Even the one or two private newspapers were lifeless under high pressure. The official reporters of the puppet regime were overwhelmingly in the majority, which was very unfavorable for progressive journalists. At first, we progressive journalists appeared in the guise of neutralists, but after the Xiaguan incident, pretending to be neutral was no longer possible. Some were forced to retreat, while others remained at their posts, fighting to the very end. For the sake of a complete narrative, I will first supplement the Chongqing Jiaochangkou incident, and then talk about the situation in Nanjing.

    (I) Exposing the Essence of the Puppet Central News Agency's Fabrication of Rumors

    On February 10, 1946, various circles in Chongqing held a celebration meeting for the success of the Old Political Consultative Conference. A bloody incident occurred at Jiaochangkou. This was a trick by the reactionaries to tear up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Before the meeting, special agents arranged thugs, and during the meeting, they used the issue of the chairman as an excuse to start a fight, and the meeting could not be held. Thugs injured Political Consultative Conference representatives Guo Moruo, and the presidium members Li Gongpu, Shi Fuliang, and several reporters were also slightly injured. The next day's report by the puppet Central News Agency completely distorted the facts. They completely obliterated the reason for the announcement that special agents had arranged thugs and Liu Yeqiao, a gangster, to rob the chairman. They said that "Liu Yeqiao had been temporarily elected as chairman" and that "the people were fighting each other." Chongqing reporters were very angry after reading the report of the puppet Central News Agency. Everyone was determined to expose this distorted report. Everyone worked together to fight a preliminary battle against the reactionary forces.

    At 2:00 p.m. that day, progressive journalists, under the pretext of comforting the beaten reporters, gathered more than 40 reporters who witnessed the actual situation at the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association for a meeting. At the meeting, everyone unanimously decided to write an open letter to the puppet Central News Agency, explaining two facts: (1) The reason for the announcement originated from the dispute on the rostrum. Because the issue of the chairman of the conference was being discussed by the presidium, Liu Yeqiao immediately announced the opening of the meeting and assumed the position of chairman. When Li Gongpu was about to go forward to negotiate with him, he was brutally beaten by thugs, and the tragedy occurred. (2) The occurrence of this unfortunate incident was a planned and organized action arranged by thugs in advance. They had prepared a declaration and slogans for the conference in advance, and carried iron objects and gravel as weapons for hitting people. During the assault, some people directed in groups, and the military police stood by and deliberately did not stop them. The so-called "fighting each other" was completely inconsistent with the facts. This open letter was signed by all 42 reporters who attended the meeting. The letter was drafted by Shi Ximin, Gao Ji, Liu Huozi, Pu Xixiu, and others.

    We spent a lot of effort to publish this letter. We knew that it would not be easy to publish this kind of letter in our own newspapers. We decided to go back and make contact separately, and we must take joint action to avoid sacrificing any one newspaper. Unexpectedly, late at night, the boss of the Ta Kung Pao suddenly refused to publish it. Other newspapers had to temporarily withdraw the manuscript and decided to postpone the publication for one day in order to discuss ways of joint action. The next day, everyone decided to publish it in the form of an advertisement, and Ta Kung Pao finally reluctantly agreed. Then we continued to fight a war of words with the puppet Central News Agency. When the puppet Central News Agency responded, we issued a declaration, stating the principle of basing news reports on facts to make another reply. These were all published in the form of advertisements. In the final declaration, Ta Kung Pao refused to even publish the advertisement. But we finally won a victory this time. We exposed the essence of the puppet Central News Agency as a rumor-mongering agency for the first time.

    Because the Kuomintang reactionaries suffered a loss in this matter, they paid special attention to progressive journalists from then on, and constantly threatened and insulted them. Gao Ji and I were beaten in Xiaguan, Nanjing later. Participating in this struggle was certainly one of the important reasons.

    During this period, the arrogance of the reactionaries gradually became rampant. On February 22, twelve days after the Jiaochangkou incident, they launched a student anti-Soviet parade in the Shaci District. During the parade, they arranged thugs to smash the Xinhua Daily's business department from the first floor to the third floor, and nine employees of the newspaper were seriously injured. The books and magazines of the newspaper were destroyed and flew all over the sky. According to statistics, the loss was more than 100 million yuan. The democratic newspaper of the China Democratic League was also destroyed. At that time, progressive journalists, under serious surveillance, could only secretly comfort their colleagues in "Xinhua" and "Democracy," and could no longer openly tweak the "tiger's whiskers."

    (II) The Ugly Drama in Xiaguan, Nanjing

    On June 23, 1947, just as the peace talks were hanging by a thread, the Xiaguan incident occurred in Nanjing. At that time, the Kuomintang-Communist peace talks were about to break down, and the people demanded that the puppet "government" extend the ceasefire period so that negotiations could be conducted over a longer period of time. However, Chiang Kai-shek only agreed to a 15-day ceasefire. Therefore, the people of Shanghai publicly elected Ma Xulun and others as representatives of the peace delegation to petition in Nanjing. When journalists encountered such a major issue, they naturally went to the station to welcome them and gather news. The peace delegation was delayed by five hours due to the obstruction of the so-called "refugees from northern Jiangsu" along the way. We who welcomed them waited from 2:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. In fact, the reactionaries had arranged thugs in Xiaguan long ago. We were full of enthusiasm and only cared about welcoming them, and we knew nothing about this conspiracy. When the delegation arrived at the station, suddenly the so-called "refugees from northern Jiangsu" who gathered from all directions gathered more and more, and surrounded everyone. Other colleagues had already left sometime, and Gao Ji and I could no longer get out after rushing left and right. The special agents pushed us and the delegation into the waiting room. Gao Ji and I had negotiated with the leader as Nanjing reporters and asked to go out. But the people inside agreed, but the people outside did not. We were beaten back every time we went out. We were beaten back three times. The last time we were dragged to the square and beaten severely. Several handfuls of my hair were pulled out. Our pens, watches, wallets, etc. were all looted the first time we went out. Towards 11:00 p.m., suddenly the surrounding voices were deafening and aggressive. It looked like they were about to break in. Sure enough, more than a dozen burly men rushed in. They first smashed glass bottles and light bulbs at us. Then they took apart tables, chairs, and sofas and hit us with them. I was immediately unable to stand and fell on Mr. Lei Jieqiong who was lying next to me. When I woke up, I saw the room full of Chinese and foreign reporters, and the military police had also been ordered to come out to clean up the mess.

    After being severely beaten in Xiaguan, it was impossible for us progressive reporters to stay in Nanjing under the oppression of the reactionary forces. Gao Ji did not want to do outside work in Nanjing anymore and withdrew to Shanghai to do internal work. I stayed put. I held on to my position at Nanjing Xinmin Daily and fought to the end with a group of progressive colleagues who stayed behind.

    (III) The Struggle of Progressive Journalists

    The two years from the withdrawal of the CCP delegation in February 1947 to the eve of liberation were the most depressing period. During this period, there were also several major events worth mentioning in the journalistic field. The first important struggle was to report on the "May 20th" Movement in 1947. The anti-hunger and anti-persecution "May 20th" Movement of Nanjing students was truly magnificent and moving. After being whipped, kicked, and charged by the cavalry, the students still held hands and marched forward while singing. When one person fell, many more stood up. On the one hand, they ridiculed "Wang Xianda" (Wang Yunwu) and cursed "Zhang Xingui" (Zhang Qun) at the puppet Executive Yuan, and on the other hand, they changed the "Youth Department" to the "Special Agent Department" and the Kuomintang to the "Scraping People's Party." The students' performance at that time was intelligent and brave. Which journalist with a conscience would not want to report truthfully on such a great scene? Everyone followed the team, desperately sending telegrams and taking pictures. But how much could be published in the newspaper depended on the boss's attitude. Thanks to the support of all colleagues in the reporting department, the Nanjing Xinmin Daily's report that day was the least censored and the most complete. Later, the students requested additional printing of that day's newspaper for distribution throughout the country. After "May 20th," the newspaper received a serious warning, and reporters interviewing school news were under severe surveillance. Later, the Shanghai Wenhui, Lianhe, and Xinmin newspapers were closed down, and many reporters were arrested. The Nanjing journalistic community had to lower its flag and remain silent. The Nanjing Xinmin Daily was closed down in July 1948. By then, the reactionary rulers were on the verge of collapse, and everything was unreasonable.

    During this most silent period, there are two things worth mentioning. First, since the withdrawal of the CCP delegation in February 1947, there was nothing worth publishing in the positive news. To publish, it had to be written in a satirical and critical style to make the readers understand the true situation. But this could not be done in the newspaper. Therefore, progressive journalists generally shifted their positions to magazine correspondence. After all, magazines were less stimulating than newspapers, and the reactionaries paid less attention to magazines. At this time, military and political correspondence in magazines was popular. The correspondence in Shanghai's "Observer" weekly was an example. Most people who read "Observer" liked to turn to the correspondence first. It told some inside stories of the military and government, and also contained some analysis and criticism. In the depressing situation, it was recognized as a more satisfactory reading material. This must be said to be the common achievement of progressive journalists from all over the country. Everyone had materials, but could not write them in the newspaper, so they all submitted articles to magazines. Political correspondence was mostly reported by Nanjing journalists.

    Second, essays were also an important product of this period. Several editors, in addition to editing articles, used a few words to stab at unsatisfactory phenomena, which were often sharp and insightful. Mr. Zheng Shixue, under the pen name Lan Yanzhi, wrote the most and the best in the Nanjing Renbao. For example, after the reporters were beaten in Xiaguan, he arranged a few large characters in his column called "Bee Sting," "No words to say today." Later, he had a column called "Hundred Shots Missed" in the Renbao supplement, which was also the most attractive. Later, such "three words and two words" also appeared in the Daily Evening News and other newspapers.

    (IV) From Prison to Liberation

    Finally, I want to talk about my time in prison. As mentioned above, we progressive journalists did not become depressed in the days of silence. We had shifted our positions to magazine correspondence. At first, the reactionaries did not pay much attention to magazine correspondence, but later they took it very seriously. This kind of correspondence continued for a year and a half. When the autumn offensive began in 1948, I could not continue. At that time, the People's Liberation Army's advance was as rapid as the autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves, and the Kuomintang reactionaries' situation was deteriorating. In this situation, it was simply impossible to find words to write the correspondence, and even if it was written reluctantly, the magazine would not dare to publish it. Therefore, we had to shift our positions to Hong Kong. It happened that the Hong Kong Wenhui Daily was published, so I changed my name and became the Nanjing special correspondent for the Hong Kong Wenhui Daily, and delivered correspondence in a secret way. At this time, many colleagues also wrote articles for the Hong Kong Hua Shang Bao and other newspapers. Writing articles for Hong Kong really felt like a great liberation and great freedom. But although the writing was relaxed, the heart was tight. While writing articles, I was also anxiously on guard against the terrible day coming. Sure enough, at ten o'clock on the night of November 16, when the Huaihai Campaign began, I was finally arrested by the puppet garrison headquarters. My last article was titled "Funeral March." I originally wanted to finish this article and go to Shanghai to avoid it. Because Nanjing had already issued martial law at that time, the situation was indeed very tense. But only half of the article was written, and I was taken to prison, becoming a never-ending article. My journalistic work in the Kuomintang-controlled area came to an end.

    I don't need to say much about my life in prison. But here I must mention that I met our long-lost colleagues Chen Zitao, Luo Hemin, Wu Ernan, and another Mr. Lu Ziying in the Xianbing Silingbu prison. They were arrested for secretly publishing the Wencui Series in Shanghai. They were arrested in July 1947 and had been in prison for nearly two years. They moved from Shanghai to Jiangsu to Nanjing, and endured hardships and tortures. We did not know each other at first, but after passing on our names across the wall, we realized that we had long been like-minded. Especially for me, who was newly imprisoned, I felt a lot of comfort from the concern of the old inmates. They had not been in contact with the outside world for a long time, and they were very excited to get some new news from the outside. The days I spent with them were not long, only a month. At ten o'clock on the night of December 27, Chen, Luo, and Lu were taken out separately and hanged and buried in Yuhuatai. Wu Ernan was left alone, as if he had escaped the net, and was still held in prison. On January 23, 1949, the puppet Xianbing Silingbu moved to Hunan, Wu was taken back to the puppet Central Bureau of Statistics, and I was taken back to the puppet garrison headquarters military law bureau. We parted ways. I was fortunate enough to be released from prison when Chiang Kai-shek stepped down and Li Zongren released political prisoners. And after the liberation of Beijing and Shanghai, there was no news of Wu Ernan, and he was probably murdered!

    Nanjing journalists who were arrested at the same time as me included Qian Shaofang of the Daily Evening News, Ye Jindong of the Jiangnan Evening News, Wu Dingyuan of the Nanjing Renbao, and Fu Gengbai of the Nanjing Daily. They either wrote about the rice-grabbing storm, or interviewed student news, or exposed the darkness of the police station. The reactionaries could not say what their crimes were, but under the rule of the reactionaries, being a conscientious reporter was a crime.

    But the night is not long after all. Nanjing and Shanghai were finally liberated, and the liberation of the whole country is imminent. Progressive journalists who were previously under Kuomintang rule have now gained freedom. In this free day, I think of everything in the past, like a nightmare. But the shadows of the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed for progressive journalism will always remain in my heart, and I believe they will always remain in people's hearts!

    南京新闻工作者在国民党统治下为民主奋斗的一段史实
    浦熙修
    对于国民党统治区进步新闻工作者在南京方面受国民党反动派摧残压迫，及为民主事业奋斗的经过事实，我想从我个人亲身的经历来作一叙述。南京是伪政府的首都，报纸自然全部控制在“官”家手中，就是有一两家民间报纸，在高压之下，也毫无生气。伪朝廷的官方记者居压倒多数，这对于进步新闻工作者是非常不利。我们进步的新闻工作者最初还是以伪装中立者的姿态出现，后来经过下关一打，伪装中立，已经绝不可能。有的不得已撤退，有的却仍是在岗位上奋斗，坚持到最后一刻。为着叙述上完整起见，我将先补述一下重庆较场口事件，然后说到南京方面的情形。
    （一）揭露伪中央社造谣的本质
    一九四六年二月十日，重庆各界举行庆祝旧政协成功大会，在较场口发生了血案。这是反动派撕毁政协决议搞的鬼把戏。开会前特务就布置了打手，开会时借口总主席问题，大打一场，会就没有开成。打手们把政协代表郭沫若，大会主席团李公朴、施复亮等打伤，记者数人亦受轻伤。第二日伪中央社的报导，完全歪曲事实。他们把特务布置好打手、流氓刘野樵去抢主席的启事原因，完全抹杀。他们说是“临时已推定刘野樵为主席”，说是“民众互相殴打”。重庆各报记者，看了伪中央社的报导，大为气愤。大家决心要起来揭破这种歪曲的报导。大家齐心来向反动势力打个前哨战。
    当日下午二时，进步记者们以慰问被打记者为名，约集了在场目睹实况的记者四十余人，假中苏文化协会开会。在会上大家一致决定给伪中央社写封公开信，说明两点事实：（一）启事原因，起于主席台上之争执。因为大会总主席问题，正由主席团洽商推举之际，刘野樵即擅行宣布开会，自任主席。李公朴正拟上前与之洽商时，即遭暴徒毒打，惨剧因此发生。（二）此次不幸事件的发生，系暴徒事先早有计划有组织的行动布置。彼等事先已准备大会宣言、口号，且身怀铁器碎石，以为打人武器。行凶之时，有人分组指挥，宪警束手旁观，故意不加阻止。所谓“互相欧打”，完全与事实不符。这封公开信，即由出席会场的记者四十二人全体签名。信是推举石西民、高集、刘火子、浦熙修等人起草的。
    为了这封信的公布，我们几个人曾费了不少气力。我们知道不是我们自己的报纸，这种信就不容易登出来。我们决定分别回去各自接头，必须采取共同行动，以免牺牲任何一家报纸。不料到深夜，大公报的老板忽然不肯登出。其他各报不得已遂临时撤消此稿，决定缓登一天，以便商量共同行动的办法。第二天，大家决定用广告的方式登出，大公报总算勉强答应了。接着我们和伪中央社继续打了一顿笔墨官司，伪中央社有答辩来，我们又发表宣言，说明新闻报导要根据事实的原理以作再答复。这都是用广告方式登出的。最后的宣言，大公报连广告都不肯登了。但这次我们总算打了一个胜仗。我们第一次揭露了伪中央社是造谣社的本质。
    国民党反动派因为在这一点上吃了亏，从此对于进步的新闻记者就特别注意起来，时时加以威胁侮蔑。我和高集后来在南京下关挨打，参加这次斗争，当然是重要原因之一。
    在这时期，反动派的气焰渐渐嚣张起来。二月二十二日，较场口事件后的十二日，他们发动了沙磁区学生的反苏大游行。在游行时，他们布置了打手，把中共的新华日报的营业部从一楼打到三楼，并把该该报的职员九人打成重伤。该报的书籍杂志捣毁得飞满了半空。事后统计，损失在一万万元以上。民盟的民主报的门市部也被捣毁。那时进步的记者在严重注视下，只能暗暗地慰问“新华”，“民主”的同业，再不能公开的去捻“虎须”了。
    （二）南京下关的丑剧
    一九四七年六月廿三日，正当和平谈判尚在不绝如缕之际，又发生了南京下关事件。那时国共和平谈判已经快要破裂，人民要求伪“政府”延长停战期限，以便从长谈判。而蒋匪只答应停战十五天。于是上海人民公推马叙伦等为和平代表团代表进京请愿。新闻记者遇上了这样大问题，当然要到车站去欢迎，并采访消息。和平代表团因为沿途受所谓“苏北难民”的阻止，到站迟误了五个钟头。我们欢迎者也就从下午二时直等到午后七时。其实反动派在下关早布置好了打手。我们满腔热忱，只顾欢迎，对此阴谋，竟一无所知。等到代表团抵站，忽然四面八方聚集的所谓“苏北难民”，竟越聚越多，把大家整个包围起来。其他的同业不知什么时候已经离开，我和高集两人左冲右撞再也出不来了。特务们把我们和代表团一起推到了候车室。我和高集曾以南京记者的身份向为首者交涉要求出去。但里面的人答应了，外面的人却不答应。我们一出去，就被打回头。三次出去，三次被打回。最后一次竟被拖在广场上大打。我的头发都被拔去了几把。我们的钢笔、手表、皮包等亦在第一次出去时被抢劫一空。将近晚十一时，忽然四围人声鼎沸，气势汹汹，眼看着他们就要打进来了。那时果然有十余条彪形大汉，一冲而入。他们先把玻璃瓶子、电灯炮往我们身上砸。接着他们又把桌子、椅子、沙发，拆开了往我们身上打。我立时被打得站立不住，就扑到了躺在旁边的雷洁琼先生身上。等我清醒过来，看见中外记者满屋，宪警也已奉到命出来收拾残局了。
    经过下关这一顿大打之后，我们进步记者在反动势力压迫之下，已经有不能在南京居留之势了。高集不愿再在南京做外勤，撤回上海做内勤。我呢，始终未动。我却坚守住南京新民报这个岗位，和留下来的一群进步的同业，一直奋斗到最后。
    （三）进步记者的奋斗
    从一九四七年二月中共代表团撤退，至解放前夕的两年中是最为消沉的时期。这期间在新闻界方面亦有可提的几件大事。第一件重要的斗争是报导一九四七年的“五，二○”运动。南京学生的反饥饿反迫害的“五，二○”运动，实在是壮烈而动人。学生们在鞭打脚踢马队冲之后，仍是手挽着手齐歌并进。一个人倒下去了，多少人又跟着站起来。他们一方面到伪行政院去嘲弄了“王贤达”（王云五），咒骂了“张新贵”（张群），一方面又把“青年部”改为“特务部”，国民党改为“刮民党”。学生们当时的表现是聪慧而勇敢。这样伟大的场面，凡有良心的新闻记者谁不愿据实报导？大家跟踪着队伍，拚命的发电讯，摄取镜头。但报纸上能够登出多少，却要看老板的态度了。南京新民报那天的报导，在采访部全体同人支持之下，总算被删最少，报导得最为完整。后来学生们要求加印那天的报纸，以便分发各地。“五，二○”之后，报纸受着严重的警告，采访学校新闻的记者都被严重监视。后来上海文汇、联合、新民三家报纸被封闭，大事逮捕记者，南京新闻界也只有收敛旗鼓，默默不动了。南京新民报是于一九四八年七月内被封的，那本已到反动统治者崩溃的前夕，一切无理可喻了。
    在这最沉寂的时候，却有两件事值得一述。第一，从一九四七年二月中共代表团撤退之后，正面的新闻没有什么值得发表的，要发表也必须用讽刺批判的笔法写出才能使读者明了真实的情况。但这在报纸上就办不到。于是一般进步的新闻记者都转移阵地到杂志的通讯去。因为杂志毕竟比报纸的刺激性要少些，反动派对于杂志的注意毕竟要轻些。在这时候，杂志上的军事及政治的通讯曾风行一时。上海“观察”周刊的通讯就是一个例子。看“观察”的人多半喜欢先翻起通讯来看。这里面述说了些军政内幕，同时也有些分析与批评。在时局沉闷中公认这是比较满意的读物。这不能不说是各地进步新闻记者共同的成绩。大家有了材料，在报上写不出，就不约而同地向杂志投稿。政治通讯，要以南京新闻记者的报导最多。
    第二，杂文也是这时期重要的产物。几位编辑先生在编稿之余，对于不满意的现象，用三言两语的方式刺一下，往往警辟深入。以蓝言之为笔名的郑时学先生在南京人报上写的最多，也最好。例如：在下关记者被打后，他在他那名为“蜂刺”的专栏里，排了几个大字，“今日无话可说”。其后，他在人报副刊里有个专栏名为“百发不中集”，也是最吸引人的。后来每日晚报等亦有这种“三言两语”出现。
    （四）从牢狱到解放
    最后，我要说到自己坐牢的一段了。上面说过，我们进步的新闻工作者，在消沉的日子里并没有消沉。我们曾转移阵地到杂志的通讯里去。最初反动派对于杂志的通讯不大注意，后来却看得非常严重。这种通讯的写作，继续了一年半，到一九四八年秋季攻势开始，我就继续不下去了。那时人民解放军的进军已如秋风扫落叶般地迅速，国民党反动派的形势日蹙。在这种情形下写通讯，简直已经无从措词，就是勉强写出来，杂志上也不敢登出去。于是不得已我们又转移阵地到香港。正好香港文汇报出版，我就换了个名字担任香港文汇报的南京特派员，用秘密的方式传递通信。这时也有不少的同业为香港华商报等写稿。给香港写稿，真觉得大解放，大自由。但笔下虽松，心中却紧。一面写稿，一面却提心吊胆地提防那可怕的日子就要来到。果然，在淮海战役一开始，十一月十六日的晚上十点钟，我终于被伪卫戍司令部逮捕了。我的最后一篇文章题名“送葬曲”，心中本想写完这篇文章，该到上海去避一避。因为那时南京已经颁布了戒严令，形势确已十分紧张。但文章只写了一半，就被随着带入牢狱，成了一篇永不完篇的文章了。我在国民党统治区的新闻工作也就从此告了结束。
    狱中生活，在此不必多述。但在这里必须一提的是，我在宪兵司令部牢中遇见了我们久已失踪的同业陈子涛、骆何民、吴二南及另外一位卢子英先生。他们是因为在上海秘密出刊文萃丛书而被捕的。他们于一九四七年七月被捕，入狱将近两年。他们自沪迁苏迁京，中间嗜尽了艰辛，受尽了酷刑。我们本来不识，但隔着墙壁通姓报名后，才知道彼此都是心契已久。尤其我这新入狱的，受着老难友的关切，感到不少安慰。他们久不与世相通，得到外面一些新消息，也觉得兴奋非凡。我和他们相处的日子并不久，仅仅一个月，在十二月二十七日的晚上十点钟，陈、骆、卢三位便分别被提出上了绞刑，埋葬在雨花台。剩下来吴二南一人，仿佛漏网之鱼，还押在狱里。一九四九年一月二十三日，伪宪兵司令部迁到湖南，吴被提回伪中统局，我被押回伪卫戍司令部军法局，我们便分了手。我在蒋匪引退，李宗仁释放政治犯的时候，侥幸出狱。而吴二南在京沪解放后，始终没有消息，多半是已遭毒手了！
    和我同时被捕的南京新闻工作者，还有每日晚报的钱少舫，江南晚报的叶劲冬，南京人报的邬定元，南京日报的傅庚白等。他们或者是写了抢米风潮，或者是访问了学生新闻，也有的暴露了警察局的黑暗。反动派都说不出他们的什么罪名，但在反动派统治下，做一个有良心的记者就是罪名。
    但是黑夜究竟是不能长久的。南京和上海终于解放了，全国的解放就在目前。以前在国民党统治下的进步的新闻记者，如今都得到了自由。在这个自由的日子，我想起过去的一切，恍如一场恶梦。但是为进步新闻工作牺牲的先烈们的影子，却永远留在我的心中，我相信，也将永远留在人们的心中！
