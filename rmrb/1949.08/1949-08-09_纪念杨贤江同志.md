    In Memory of Comrade Yang Xianjiang
    Pan Zinian

    Comrade Xianjiang passed away eighteen years ago. He was a promoter and educator of the youth movement after the May Fourth Movement. Today's youth may know very little about his name, but the revolutionary youth, even those who are middle-aged and elderly, rarely do not know his name. After the May Fourth Movement, a wave of eagerness for the rapid emergence of a new China swept through Chinese youth, as if they were hungry and thirsty, drunk and crazy. Everyone was imagining, discussing, and debating what the new China they imagined would look like, and each came up with a blueprint for the new China. Each thought they were right and refused to give way, often arguing with each other until their faces turned red, which was quite lively. But when the Great Revolution failed, Chiang Kai-shek's reign of terror separated those passionate debaters. Some felt disillusioned and went back to their muddled lives. Others persisted in the belief that the new China would surely come and continued to seek the path to reach the new China—this was the group of Marxist-Leninist believers to which Comrade Xianjiang belonged.

    Xianjiang and his comrades immediately published a journal specifically for young people to read and explore the path to realizing the new China. As a result, it was intolerable to Chiang Kai-shek's rule at the time, and they had to go into exile in Japan, where they studied and wrote and translated several books on new education, supporting themselves with royalties. But the revolutionary and patriotic youth of China could not be tolerated by the reactionary rule of Japan either, so they had to return to their motherland. Xianjiang returned to Shanghai and could only live in seclusion in a room upstairs in a friend's house. At that time, his health was already very poor, but since he was not even allowed to leave the room, there was no question of treatment. Later, when his tuberculosis became very serious, friends raised some money to send him to Japan for medical treatment, but he finally died of his illness.

    Eighteen years have passed, and the world has changed dramatically. The new China that the revolutionary youth of that time yearned for and pursued has already revealed most of its form. Today's youth no longer need to yearn for the new China but must strive step by step to build it according to the blueprint drawn by their leader, Chairman Mao. In this situation, when we remember Comrade Xianjiang, we cannot help but feel grief for his experiences at that time, but we must also express our deep gratitude to him for the bright road we are taking today. Lu Xun said that the road is made by walking on it. Today's bright road is imprinted with the footprints of Xianjiang and many other comrades.

    纪念杨贤江同志
    潘梓年
    贤江同志，已经逝世十八年了。他是五四以后青年运动的宣传教育者。今天的青年，亦许很少知道他的名字，当年的革命青年，以至中年，老年，却很少不知道他的名字。五四以后，在中国青年中，掀起了一股企求新中国快快出现的热潮，如饥如渴，如醉如狂。大家在憧憬着，讨论着，争辩着自己想象中的新中国将是怎样的一个面貌，各自拟出一幅新中国的图案。自以为是，各不相让，常常彼此争论得面红耳赤，好不热闹。等到大革命一失败，蒋介石的恐怖统治就把那些热情的争论者分开了。有的感到幻灭，仍旧去过他迷迷糊糊的生活。有的却坚持着新中国一定能够来到的信念，继续钻求到达新中国的道路。——这就是贤江同志所属的一群马列主义的信徒。
    贤江他们，当即出版一个刊物，专供青年阅读，探究实现新中国的道路。因而为当时蒋介石统治所不容，只得流亡到日本，在那里读书，并且写译了几本关于新教育的著作，靠稿费来养活自己。但是中国的革命爱国青年也不能见容于日本的反动统治，他们又只好转回到祖国。贤江回到上海，只能蛰居朋友家一间楼上，那时他的健康已经很差，但既房门都不许出，还讲什么治病。后来结核病到了十分严重，才由朋友们筹募了一些钱，再到日本去医疗，终于不治而死。
    事隔一十八年，天下已经大变。当年革命青年所憧憬、所追求的新中国，竟已现出了大半身。今日的青年，对于新中国，已再不用憧憬，而要照着自己领袖毛主席所打的图样来按步就班的努力建筑了。在这情景之下，我们追念贤江同志，一面为他当时的遭遇不胜悲痛，一面却要为我们今天所走的光明大道，对他深深感谢。鲁迅说，路是踏出来的，今天的光明大道上，就印着贤江他们许多同志的脚迹。
