Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th.
Comrade Lin Feng, Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, reported to the Northeast People's Representative Conference on the work of the Northeast People's Government over the past three years. The summary is as follows:
    (1) On supporting the People's Liberation War. The glorious achievement of the Northeast People's Liberation Army in annihilating 1.23 million enemies in the past four years is inseparable from the extensive and active support of the people of Northeast China. In the past three years, 1.6 million workers and peasants joined the People's Liberation Army. In the past three years, a large number of migrant workers, stretchers, carts, and mules and horses were mobilized, and great achievements were made in providing medical care for the wounded and sick in the rear, resettling honorary soldiers, comforting the People's Liberation Army, and giving preferential treatment to the families of the People's Liberation Army by tilling and sowing on their behalf. However, the work of honoring soldiers has not attracted universal attention, and the work of giving preferential treatment to families is not thorough and timely enough, which are shortcomings in the work of supporting the war.
  Land reform is fully completed
    (2) On land reform. In July 1946, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC decided to carry out land reform, mobilize the masses, establish base areas, and combat the attacks of the Chiang Kai-shek-American reactionaries. Governments at all levels actively led the people to carry out land reform. In October 1947, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China promulgated the Outline Land Law of China. The Northeast Political Committee immediately formulated supplementary measures for the implementation of the Outline Land Law based on the specific conditions in the Northeast, and the movement was further unfolded. The old areas of North Manchuria completed land reform in the spring of 1948, and the new areas of South Manchuria also ended this spring. According to incomplete statistics, the old areas of North Manchuria distributed more than 37.1 million mu of land, as well as a large number of livestock, vehicles, clothing, and cloth, and unearthed a number of guns and ammunition weapons. Each farmer in North Manchuria received an average of about seven mu of land, and each farmer in South Manchuria received an average of about three mu of land, and most farmers received a head of livestock. Through land reform, the peasant masses, especially the poor and landless peasants, have been more fully mobilized, and a large number of activists have emerged in the movement, which has laid a solid foundation for the people's democratic dictatorship and powerfully supported the War of Liberation. In the land reform, all localities basically implemented the policy of relying on poor and hired peasants and firmly uniting with middle peasants; however, in a short period of time, "leftist" errors that violated the policy occurred, but were quickly corrected under the leadership of the Northeast Bureau. Land reform is the main symbol of the emancipation of the people of Northeast China and the main reliance for the victory of the war. The overthrown feudal forces are still trying to make a comeback. Recently, Kuomintang secret agents and bandits lurking in various parts of Northeast China have colluded with feudal sects to carry out sabotage activities. This situation must be guarded against.
    (3) On economic construction. In the early days of the People's Liberation War, because the main areas of the Northeast Liberated Area were in North Manchuria, with fewer industrial cities, the economic construction policy at that time was based on agricultural production to ensure war supplies. In July 1948, the Northeast Political Committee put forward the policy of giving equal importance to industry and agriculture in accordance with the victorious development of the war. After the liberation of the entire Northeast last autumn, the focus of economic construction shifted from agriculture to industry and from rural areas to cities. In the past three years, the economic construction work in the entire Northeast has achieved great success in all aspects.
  Strive to exceed the 1944 agricultural production level within three years
    In terms of agriculture, the achievements in agricultural production and construction in the past three years have been enormous, with a total of more than 21.36 million mu of cultivated land restored, and the current cultivated land area has reached 94% of the cultivated land area in the entire Northeast in 1946. Since the policy of intensive cultivation and increasing yields was put forward in 1948, the average yield per mu has gradually increased. The output of wheat, rice, and soybeans has increased significantly due to the increase in the conversion rate for the collection of public grain and the implementation of production incentive policies. In order to adapt to industrial construction, the government has adopted a policy of encouraging the expansion of the production of special crops such as cotton, hemp, tussah silkworm, and tobacco. In the past three years, water conservancy construction has focused on flood prevention and water management, and key water field projects have been restored, with nearly 2 million mu of water fields restored and developed. There are now 17 tractor farms of various sizes, with about 200,000 mu of cultivated land. In the work of organizing farmers to exchange labor and share plows on a private basis and in accordance with the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, there have been two deviations: forced orders and laissez-faire. In the future, we should adhere to the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit and adopt various organizational forms according to the different conditions in various places. In the past three years, farmers have turned in 4.5 million tons of public grain to support the war and supply the needs of cities and industrial raw materials. Although the focus of leadership will shift to cities and industry in the future, we must never neglect agriculture. Agricultural areas should still focus on developing agricultural production, and provinces should adopt a policy of taking both urban and rural areas into consideration. The leadership below the county level should generally focus on agriculture. The entire Northeast should strive to exceed the agricultural production level before 1944 within three years.
  A new period of industrial construction has begun, and the total value of state-owned industrial products this year will reach 6.5 million tons of grain.
    In terms of industry, when the South Manchuria industrial zone was occupied and entrenched by the Kuomintang, the Northeast was in a state of division, the proportion of industry was still small, and there was no large-scale recovery and development of industry. However, the government still overcame various difficulties and engaged in the operation of industrial and mining enterprises such as coal, paper, rubber, and textiles with considerable strength, and strived to restore railway transportation. The liberation of the entire Northeast marked the beginning of a new period of industrial construction. The government carried out restoration on the one hand and transformed the colonial industrial properties of the enemy, puppets, and bureaucratic capital on the other. In December 1948, nine administrative bureaus including coal, electricity, machinery, chemicals, textiles, enterprises, gold mines, and non-ferrous metals, as well as two companies, Anshan Iron and Steel and Benxi Coal and Iron, were established under the Industrial Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee. In January of this year, the 1949 industrial production and construction plan focusing on heavy industry began to be formulated, with the aim of reaching an average of 40% of the highest production level of the puppet Manchukuo in 1950. For this purpose, the state invested 2 million tons of grain in industry. The total value of state-owned industrial products is expected to reach 6.5 million tons of grain this year. By the end of the year, the number of employees in state-owned enterprises will reach 300,000 (excluding railway, military industry, military supplies, and timber logging workers). As of now, the vast majority of factories and mines have completed or exceeded their production and repair plans. The two companies, Anshan and Benxi, have started production ahead of schedule. There will be 14 non-ferrous metal mines starting operation this year. State-owned coal mines can complete and exceed 9 million tons of output this year. It is estimated that electricity can supply more than 300,000 kilowatts by the end of this year. The machinery industry will serve the restoration of various factories and mines this year and systematically strengthen itself, laying the initial foundation for an independent and autonomous machinery manufacturing industry. Other industries such as timber, chemicals, cement, papermaking, rubber, textiles, and salt fields are also actively restoring operations and improving management in order to accumulate funds for the country. The urgent problem to be solved in industrial production is the establishment of economic accounting. The solution to this problem must rely on workers, unite technical personnel, and strive to learn humbly.
    On December 27, 1948, the Political Committee promulgated the "Northeast Public Enterprise Wartime Provisional Labor Insurance Regulations" to protect the health of employees of public enterprises and alleviate their wartime living difficulties. After the promulgation of the regulations, although certain results have been achieved in the establishment of employee hospitals and sanatoriums, the regulations focus on individual, decentralized, passive, and relief-oriented provisions. In the future, efforts must be made towards active and collective welfare undertakings.
　　State-owned commerce and cooperative economy are gradually developing, and prices are becoming more stable.
    The state-owned commerce and cooperative economy in Northeast China are gradually developing. In the past three years, we have purchased surplus grain and rural specialties and by-products from farmers, and exported them in large quantities in exchange for industrial equipment and materials lacking locally, which has assisted the construction of industry and mining, and gradually adjusted the price ratio of industrial and agricultural products reasonably, stimulating agricultural and rural by-product production. After the liberation of the entire Northeast, prices have become more stable, and the price index has only increased by an average of 40% compared to the end of last year. By March of this year, state-owned stores had established a total of 637 business units.
    In terms of financial work, we have successfully carried out the struggle to eliminate enemy and puppet currencies, established a unified currency system, and launched bank deposit and loan business in the past three years. In order to develop the economy, the government issued the first phase of 1949 in-kind prize bonds, and the amount subscribed by people in various places exceeded the predetermined quota by 25%.
    Railway transportation and postal and telecommunications services have developed extremely rapidly. Railways have been built on 88.6% of the lines in the entire Northeast. The number of locomotives has increased by 686% compared to June 1946. The most valuable thing is that the management of people's railways has adopted the Soviet experience and began to implement the system of responsibility for train operations and crew operations in December 1948, opening a new page in the construction of people's railways.
    Regarding private industry and commerce, we have implemented the policy of "giving consideration to both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital" in the past three years, protecting and developing legitimate businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, and severely cracking down on speculators and profiteers. However, private capitalists still have ideological concerns. We should explain the policy to them and try our best to help them solve the difficulties of raw materials and sales. On the one hand, we should educate employees of private enterprises so that they understand that temporary interests must be subordinate to long-term interests and abide by the policy of benefiting both labor and capital; on the other hand, we should also educate capitalists so that they understand that they must appropriately guarantee the lives of employees and the basic welfare of employees in order to develop production. In order to correctly resolve labor-capital relations, it is best to conclude collective contracts based on the principle of benefiting both labor and capital.
　　The poison of enemy and puppet enslavement education and Kuomintang party-based education has been initially eliminated, and the number of primary, secondary, and tertiary schools and the number of students have exceeded any previous period.
    (4) On education and health work. In terms of education, the poison of enemy and puppet enslavement education and Kuomintang party-based education has been initially eliminated in the past three years, and the policy of new democratic education has been established. The number of primary schools, middle schools, and universities and the number of students now exceed any period before "September 18th" or under the rule of the puppet Manchukuo and the Kuomintang. The proportion of children of working people in the student population has increased sharply. Adult education has begun to be carried out through winter schools in the past year since the land reform. In addition to the Northeast Workers' Political University, many schools or short-term training courses have been established in major cities for the political and cultural education of workers. Attention has also been paid to the development of education for ethnic minorities. Primary, secondary, and tertiary schools in ethnic minority areas all use the languages ​​and scripts of their respective ethnic minorities for teaching. In the past, health work mainly served the war, and locally it mainly fought against the plague. In the past three years, a total of more than 230,000 wounded and sick soldiers have been treated, enabling 85% of the wounded to return to the front line or participate in production. After the liberation of the entire Northeast, 73 health agencies were equipped to follow the army and serve. Since August 1947, we have fought against the serious plague in West Manchuria and spent a large amount of money on establishing epidemic prevention teams, training epidemic prevention personnel, and setting up epidemic prevention stations. Thanks to the assistance of Soviet personnel and technology, the epidemic prevention work has achieved great results.
    (5) On the work of the Public Security Bureau and the judiciary. The public security and judicial work has played a great role in supporting the war, cooperating with land reform, and maintaining social order, and has given a powerful blow to the sabotage activities of the Kuomintang reactionaries and secret agents. The shortcomings in public security work are: the existence of disorganized and undisciplined phenomena, the public security work in cities has not yet been put on the right track, and the phenomena of bureaucracy and detachment from the masses of some public security personnel. Regarding judicial work, it is still a relatively weak link in the government's work, and the new spirit of the rule of law is still lacking. In the future, those who undermine the people's laws, especially the reactionaries who undermine economic construction, must be suppressed and sanctioned.
　　Village elections have been completed in most basic areas
    (6) On the construction of democratic power. In the movement to divide land equally, peasant associations and poor peasant leagues were established in rural areas, becoming the foundation of rural power. In July 1948, the Political Committee decided to change its subordinate committees into departments, implement collective leadership, the first-responsible system, improve the organizations of governments at all levels, and deploy systematic power-building work. By the spring of this year, village elections and individual county elections have been conducted in most basic areas. Among them, the village elections in the provinces of North Manchuria were all completed in March of this year, and village people's representative conferences and village people's government committees were established, further consolidating the advantages of poor and middle peasants and making the rural power a power led by the working class, with poor peasants as the backbone, and united with middle peasants and other revolutionary classes. In the future, we must continue to implement the direction of the people's democratic dictatorship, and governments at all levels should quickly convene people's representative conferences. At the same time, all localities must improve existing cadres, train new cadres, overcome various undesirable tendencies, implement the work style of serving the people, and strengthen the ties between the government and the people.
    Ethnic minorities are respected
    On the policy towards ethnic minorities. There are 2.67 million ethnic minorities in Northeast China, including Mongolians, Koreans, and Hui people. We have implemented a policy of equality and unity towards these ethnic minorities. In addition to the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government in Inner Mongolia, ethnic minority affairs departments have been established in areas where there are ethnic minority people, respecting their customs, habits, religious beliefs, languages, and scripts. Therefore, all ethnic minorities have actively participated in various revolutionary construction works.
    Chairman Lin Feng finally emphasized: The Northeast has been liberated, but Chairman Mao said that this is only the first step in the Long March. We must be vigilant against the conspiracies and sabotage of imperialism and its lackeys, and at the same time, we must learn things we don't understand. The first thing is to learn economic work, especially to learn from the Soviet Union. As long as we are willing to work hard, we will definitely learn. Under the strong leadership of the Northeast Bureau, relying on workers and peasants, uniting all revolutionary classes, and being neither arrogant nor impetuous, we will definitely be able to build a new industrialized Northeast.

　　东北人民代表大会上
  　林枫主席报告政府工作
    【新华社沈阳二十六日电】本月二十一日，东北行政委员会主席林枫向东北人民代表大会报告东北人民政府三年来工作，摘要如下：
    （一）关于支援人民解放战争。东北人民解放军四年来歼敌一百二十三万的辉煌战绩，是同东北人民广泛而积极的支援分不开的。三年中，有一百六十万工农群众参加了人民解放军。三年中动员大量的民工、担架、大车、骡马，和在后方医疗照顾伤病员，安置荣誉军人，慰劳解放军，优待解放军人家属，为解放军人家属代耕代种等项工作，都有很大的成绩。但是，荣军工作尚未引起普遍重视，优属工作还不够切实和及时，这是支援战争工作中的缺点。
  　土地改革全部完成
    （二）关于土地改革。一九四六年七月中共东北局决定实行土地改革，发动群众，建立根据地，打击蒋美反动派进攻。各级政府积极领导人民进行土地改革。一九四七年十月中共中央颁布了中国土地法大纲。东北政委会立即根据东北具体情况，制定了实行土地法大纲的补充办法，运动乃进一步展开。北满各地于一九四八年春完成了土地改革，南满新区亦于今春结束。据不完全统计，北满老区共分配土地三千七百一十万余亩，及大批牲口、车辆、衣服、布匹等，并起出若干枪弹武器。北满每个农民平均分得土地七亩左右，南满平均分得土地三亩左右，多数农民分到一头牲口。经过土地改革，农民群众特别是贫雇农都已经比较充分地发动起来，大批积极分子在运动中涌现了，这样就奠定了人民民主专政的坚固基础，有力地支援了解放战争。在土地改革中，各地基本上贯彻了依靠贫雇农、坚决团结中农的方针；但在一个短时期中，曾经发生过违反政策的左的错误，后来在东北局领导下已迅速纠正了。土地改革是东北人民翻身的主要标志，是战争胜利的主要依靠。被打倒的封建势力迄今仍在企图卷土重来，最近东北各地国民党潜伏的特务匪徒更与封建会门勾结起来，进行破坏活动。这种情况必须引起警惕。
    （三）关于经济建设。人民解放战争初期，因为东北解放区主要地区在北满，工业城市较少，当时经济建设的方针是以农业生产为主，以保证战争供应。到了一九四八年七月，东北政委会根据战争的胜利发展，提出了工农业并重的方针。去年秋天东北全境解放后，经济建设的重心即由农业转到工业，由乡村转到城市。三年来，全东北的经济建设工作在各方面得到了很大的成就。
  　争取在三年内超过一九四四年农业生产水平
    农业方面，三年来农业生产建设的成绩是巨大的，共恢复耕地面积二千一百卅六万余亩，现耕地面积已达一九四六年全东北的耕地面积的百分之九十四。一九四八年开始提出精耕细作提高产量的方针以后。每亩地的平均产量乃逐渐增加。麦、稻和大豆的产量并因征收公粮折合率的提高和实行产奖励政策，耕种地积和平均产量均显著增加。为适应工业建设，政府采取了鼓励特种作物如棉麻、柞蚕、烟草等扩大生产的方针。三年来水利建设以防水治水为主，有重点的恢复水田工程，共恢复和发展了水田近二百万亩，拖拉机农场已有大小十七个，耕地约二十万亩。在组织农民在私有基础上、在自愿两利原则下进行换工插犋的工作中，曾先后发生过强迫命令及放任自流的两种偏向，今后应坚持自愿两利原则，根据各地不同情况，采取各种不同的组织形式。三年来农民交纳了四百五十万吨公粮支援了战争，供给了城市需要和工业原料。今后领导重心虽转入城市和工业，但绝不能忽视农业。农业地区仍应以发展农业生产为主，各省应采取城乡兼顾的方针，县以下领导生产一般的应以农业为主。全东北要争取在三年以内超过一九四四年以前的农业生产水平。
  　开始了工业建设的新时期，今年国营工业产品总值将达六百五十万吨粮食。
    工业方面，在南满工业区被国民党侵占盘踞时，东北处于被分割状态，工业比重还小，谈不上工业的大规模恢复与发展。但政府仍克服各种困难，以相当力量从事工矿业如煤、纸、橡胶、纺织等企业的经营，并努力恢复铁路运输。东北全境解放，开始了工业建设的新时期，政府一面进行恢复，一面对敌伪和官僚资本民殖地性的工业加以改造。一九四八年十二月，在东北行政委员会工业部之下成立了煤、电、机械、化学、纺织、企业、金矿、有色金属等九个管理局及鞍山钢铁及本溪煤铁两个公司。今年一月开始制订以重工业为重点的一九四九年工业生产修建计划，以期于一九五零年度平均达到伪满最高生产水平的百分之四十。为了这个目的，国家对工业投资折合食粮二百万吨。今年国营工业产品总值预计将达六百五十万吨粮食。到年底，国营企业职工人数可达三十万人（不包括铁路、军工、军需及林木采伐工人）。截至目前止，绝大多数厂矿都完成或超过了生产与修复计划。鞍山和本溪两个公司则已提前开工生产。有色金属今年将有十四处矿山开工。国营煤矿今年可完成并超过九百万吨产量。电力预计到今年年底可供应三十余万基罗瓦特。机械工业今年将服务于各厂矿的修复并有计划地壮大自己，打下独立自主的机械制造业的初步基础。其他如木材、化学、水泥、造纸、橡胶、纺织、盐田等业，均在积极恢复经营并改善管理，以为国家积蓄资金。工业生产中急待解决的是建立经济核算的问解。这个问题的解决必须依靠工人，团结技术人员，并且努力虚心学习。
    一九四八年十二月二十七日政委会颁布了“东北公营企业战时暂行劳动保险条例”，以保护公营企业职工之健康，减轻其战时生活困难。在条例公布以后，虽然在设立职工医院疗养所等方面，已收到一定成效，但条例偏重了个人的分散的消极的和救济性的规定，今后须向积极的集体福利事业方面努力。
　　国营商业与合作经济逐渐发展，物价日趋平稳。
    东北的国营商业与合作社经济在逐渐发展中。三年来采购农民余粮及农村特产副业品，以大部出口换回工业器材和本地缺乏的物资，协助了工矿业建设，也使工农产品比价逐渐得到合理的调整，刺激了农业和农村副业生产。东北全境解放后，物价日趋平稳，现在物价指数较去年底平均只增加百分之四十。国业商店，迄今年三月共建立了六百三十七个营业单位。
    在金融工作方面，三年来胜利地进行了肃清敌伪货币的斗争，建立了统一的货币体系，开展了银行存放款业务。为了发展经济，政府发行了一九四九年上期实物有奖公债，各地人民认购数量超过预定额百分之二十五。
    铁路交通邮电事业发展极快。铁路已修通全东北线路的百分之八十八·六，现有机车数较之一九四六年六月增加了百分之六百八十六。最为可贵的是人民铁路的管理，接受了苏联的经验，于一九四八年十二月开始实行车务负责制和乘务负责制，开创了人民铁路建设的新的一页。
    对于私营工商业，三年来我们执行了“公私兼顾，劳资两利”的方针，对有益于国计民生的正当营业，加以保护，并使之发展；对投机倒把者严加取缔。但私人资本家思想上仍有顾虑，应对他们说清政策，尽可能设法帮助他们解决原料和销路的困难。一方面应当教育私营企业职工，使他们懂得暂时利益必须服从长远利益，遵守劳资两利政策；另一方面也应该教育资本家使他们懂得必须适当保障职工生活和起码的职工福利，才能发展生产。为了正确地解决劳资关系，最好是在劳资两利的原则上订立集体合同。
　　初步肃清了敌伪奴化教育和国民党党化教育遗毒，大中小学数目和学生人数超过了已往任何时期。
    （四）关于教育工作和卫生工作。在教育工作方面，三年来已初步肃清了敌伪奴化教育和国民党党化教育的遗毒，树立了新民主主义教育的方针。现在小学、中学、高等学校的数目和学生人数，已超过了“九一八”以前或伪满及国民党统治的任何时期。而学生成份，劳动人民子弟的比例已急剧增加。对成人教育，在土地改革后最近一年来已开始通过冬学来进行。对工人的政治文化教育，除东北工人政治大学外，各主要城市均办了不少的学校或短期训练班。对少数民族教育也注意发展，少数民族区的大、中、小学，一律使用各少数民族自己的语言文字进行教学。卫生工作，过去主要是为战争服务，在地方上则主要的是向鼠疫作斗争。三年来计治愈伤病员二十三万余人，使百分之八十五的伤员重上前线或参加生产。东北全境解放后，又配备了七十三个卫生机关进关随军服务。自一九四七年八月起，我们对西满严重的鼠疫进行了斗争，并为建立防疫队、训练防疫人员、设防疫站等支出了大批经费。由于我们得到苏联人员和技术的援助，防疫工作收到极大成绩。
    （五）关于公安局司法工作。公安司法工作在支援战争、配合土地改革、维持治安等各方面都起了很大作用，给了美蒋反动派特务破坏活动以有力的打击。治安工作上的缺点是：存在着无组织无纪律现象，城市公安工作至今尚未走上正轨，某些公安人员的官僚主义脱离群众等现象。关于司法工作，仍是政府工作中比较薄弱的一环，新的法治精神还差。今后须对破坏人民法律，尤其是破坏经济建设的反动分子，施以镇压制裁。
　　大部基本地区完成了村选
    （六）关于民主政权建设。在平分土地运动中，农村建立了贫雇农团和农会，成为农村政权的基础。一九四八年七月，政委会决定将所属各委员会改为部，实行了集体领导、首先负责制度，并健全了各级政府组织，同时布置了系统的政权建政工作。至今年春天，大部分基本地区都进行了村选和个别县的县选。其中北满各省村选于今年三月已全部完成，成立了村人民代表会议和村人民政府委员会，进一步巩固了雇贫中农的优势，使农村政权成为工人阶级领导的、以雇贫农为　骨干的、联合中农和其他革命阶级的政权。今后要继续贯彻人民民主专政方向，各级政府应迅速召开人民代表会议。同时各地要提高现有干部，培养新干部，克服各种不良倾向，贯彻为人民服务作风，密切政权与人民的联系。
    少数民族得到尊重
    关于少数民族政策。东北的蒙古、朝鲜、回民等少数民族，共有二百六十七万人。对于这些少数民族，我们实行了平等和团结的政策。除内蒙古成立内蒙自治政府外，在有少数民族人民的地区都设立了少数民族工作部门，尊重其风俗、习惯、宗教信仰、语言、文字，因而各少数民族也积极地参加了各种革命建设工作。
    林枫主席最后着重指出：东北解放了，但毛主席说过，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。我们必须警惕帝国主义及其走狗的阴谋破坏，同时必须学会自己不懂的东西，首先是要学会经济工作，特别是要向苏联学习。只要我们肯努力，我们一定能学会。在东北局的坚强领导下，依靠工人和农民，团结各革命阶层，不骄不躁，我们就一定可以建设起一个工业化的新东北。
