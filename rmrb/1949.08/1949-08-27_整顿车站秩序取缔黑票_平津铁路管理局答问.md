To the Editor:

　　The order at Tianjin East Station is extremely chaotic. Some passengers have been sitting on the floor for three days and three nights, still unable to buy tickets (because staying in a hotel costs money). Furthermore, one railway police officer was seen beating people while maintaining order. Ticket sellers only start selling tickets half an hour before the train enters the station, and the ticketing process is extremely slow, taking about ten minutes to sell each ticket. When the time comes, the ticket window is closed immediately, leading to a flourishing black market for tickets, but with a 20 yuan service fee. The above was witnessed around noon on July 12th before the departure of Train 106. Please forward this letter to Tianjin East Station, hoping they can make improvements.

To the 68th Army Artillery Regiment Staff Office, Chinese People's Liberation Army:

　　Your letter forwarded by the People's Daily is acknowledged with thanks. Our responses are as follows:

　　1. Tianjin East Station is the main hub for the departure, arrival, and transfer of trains on the Pingjin, Jin-Shen, and Jinpu lines. Therefore, there are many train services every day, and the number of passengers getting on and off the train is often twenty to thirty thousand. Coupled with the inadequate facilities, it appears crowded and chaotic. We are currently studying ways to gradually improve the situation based on the railway's economic condition. Regarding the issue of passengers purchasing tickets, in order to maintain order at the station, we have stipulated that people line up in order and purchase tickets in sequence. However, some out-of-town passengers come to Tianjin to conduct business transactions, and after completing their transactions, they go to the station to wait for the train. Due to the long waiting time and physical fatigue, some people lie down on the floor to rest. According to our investigation results, there has been no case of waiting for three days and nights without being able to buy a ticket.

　　2. Regarding the railway police officers beating people while maintaining order, we have, based on your letter, ordered the railway's Public Security Department to investigate, but after review, no one has admitted to it. We will pay attention to inspection at any time in the future, and strengthen education.

　　3. The ticket selling time at Tianjin East Station is usually two hours before the arrival of each train. If there are a large number of passengers, it will be brought forward. However, Train 106 is an express train between Pingjin with reserved seats, and the number of tickets must be sold according to the number of seats. In addition to the reserved seat tickets, no-seat tickets are also sold, but the regulations stipulate that this cannot exceed approximately 20% of the train's capacity. Therefore, sales are stopped once the limit is reached. As for the slow ticketing procedure by the ticket sellers, we have ordered the station to provide technical training.

　　4. Regarding the elimination of black market tickets, our railway is determined to thoroughly eradicate it. The current countermeasures being taken are as follows: (1) For express trains with reserved seats, an additional 20% of no-seat tickets are sold for each train, so that passengers still have the opportunity to buy tickets after the quota is full. (2) The new regulations for reserved seat tickets stipulate that tickets can only be refunded one hour before departure, and will be invalid if the time is exceeded, so as to restrict black market ticket vendors, because they will lose money if they cannot sell the tickets. (3) Strengthen telephone ticket delivery and pre-sale of tickets at business offices, and entrust the six branches of the China Travel Service in Pingjin to sell our railway tickets on our behalf, in order to make it easier for passengers to buy tickets and reduce crowding at the station. (4) Adopt reward measures. Passengers who discover black market tickets will be given funds equal to the ticket price, or free tickets of the same class on the same train. Railway employees who discover them will also be awarded half of the ticket price. (5) Adopt punitive measures. Railway public security personnel and local public security personnel will separately investigate and eliminate them within their respective jurisdictions.

### 整顿车站秩序取缔黑票　平津铁路管理局答问

　　整顿车站秩序取缔黑票
  　平津铁路管理局答问编辑同志：
    天津东站秩序异常混乱，有席地而坐等了三日三夜仍买不到票的旅客（因住店需钱）。并有一车警为维持秩序竟打人。售票员于车进站半点钟前才售票，售票手续极慢，每张票约十余分钟方能售出。到时即将售票窗口一闭，因而票之黑市交易兴隆；但需手续费二十元。以上为七月十二日过午于一○六次行车前所见，请将此信转天津东站，希能予以改进。　六十八军炮兵团参谋处中国人民解放军第六十八军炮兵团参谋处同志：
    人民日报转到来函，敬悉。兹分别答复如后：
    一、天津东站为平津、津沈及津浦各线列车的始发、到达和中转的总枢纽，因此每日车次甚多，上下车的旅客经常两、三万人，加以设备不够健全，所以显得有人多混乱现象，现正根据本路经济状况，研究逐步改善。至于旅客购票问题，我们为了维持车站秩序，规定是顺序排列，依先后次序购买，但有少数外乡旅客来津办理买卖，交易完了之后就到车站候车，因为等车时间过长和身体疲劳的关系，有人席地而卧，借以休息，根据我们的调查结果，尚无等候三昼夜买不到票的事情。
    二、铁路公安队员为维持秩序打人，我们已根据你的来函饬令本路公安处追查，但经检讨结果尚无人承认。我们今后当随时注意检查，并加强教育。
    三、天津东站售票的时间，通常是在每次列车未进站前的两小时，若逢旅客众多再行提前。但一○六次是平津间的对号快车，票数须按座位数发售；就是在对号票以外，再卖无号客票，规定也不能超过列车定员数约百分之二十，所以售完即行停止。至售票员售票手续迟慢，我们已经饬令该站对技术上予以训练。
    四、黑票取缔的问题，本路抱有彻底肃清决心，目前所采取的对策如下：（１）对号快车每辆照定员的数目增售百分之二十的无号客票，使定额满后旅客仍有买票的机会。（２）对号客票新规章已规定限在开车前一小时退票，过时作废，以时间限制黑票贩子，因此如卖不出即要赔本。（３）加强电话送票与营业所预售客票，并委托中国旅行社在平津所设分支社六处代售本路客票，以谋旅客买票便利而减少车站买票的拥挤。（４）采用奖励办法，对于查获黑票的旅客给予与票价同额的资金，或免费赠送同列车同等级的客票乘车；本路职工查获亦照票价半数给奖。（５）采用惩治办法，由铁路公安人员及地方公安人员分别在管界内查缉取缔。
