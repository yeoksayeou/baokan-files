　　Our Constructive Labor Must Not Be Disrupted by War
　　Workers' and Peasants' Representatives Warn Warmongers
　　Tikhonov's concluding remarks sparked a storm of prolonged and unceasing cheers.
　　Next to speak was Vavilov, Chairman of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. He said: It is the responsibility of clear-headed and honest scientific workers and all intellectuals to use every possible means to prevent science from being used to prepare for war against free and democratic countries. He said: We must use tenfold the effort to develop science for the benefit of free humanity and do everything possible to make science oppose the enslavement of the people, oppose the exploitation of capitalism.
　　Kuznetsov, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, said: Everyone who loves the cause of peace knows that only the powerful democratic camp, led by Comrade Stalin, the great genius of mankind, can stand against the warmongers and the stranglers of democratic freedom. Kuznetsov also said: The democratic forces defending peace are strong. These forces are supported by the democratic working-class movement, the national liberation struggles in colonial and dependent countries, and all common people who support peace and progress. The Soviet trade unions, carrying out the will of millions of workers in the Soviet state, will unswervingly and faithfully fight for peace and friendship between nations.
　　Rossiisky, an outstanding foreman at the "Kaliber" factory in Moscow and winner of the Stalin Prize, said: Like every Soviet worker, I know that everything we make makes our motherland stronger and the peace of the world more solid. (These words were drowned out by unanimous applause.) We do not want and will not allow war to interfere with our constructive labor and destroy the results of our persistent work.
　　Litovchenko, Chairman of the Stalin Collective Farm in Kherson Oblast, Ukraine, said: Let all those who oppose peace remember that the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and all peace-loving friends in Western countries have enough strength and determination to break the backs of the warmongers.
　　Next to speak was Popova, Chairman of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee. She said: We Soviet women also do not want war. We will never forget our dead sons, husbands, and brothers, and we will also not forget the tears of mothers and wives and the suffering of our people. We have not forgotten the devastation of cities and villages. Popova called on women of all countries to strengthen international solidarity in the struggle for peace and to ruthlessly expose the warmongers.

　　我们建设性的劳动决不容许战争干扰
  　工人农民代表警告战贩
    吉洪诺夫的结束语引起暴风雨般的历久不息的欢呼。
    接着是苏联科学院主席瓦维洛夫的发言。他说：头脑清醒而诚实的科学工作者和全体知识分子的责任，就是用尽一切可能的方法，防止科学被使用于准备对自由民主国家的战争。他说：我们必须用十倍的努力来为自由人类的利益发展科学，并且要尽一切可能使科学反对奴役人民，反对资本主义的剥削。
    全苏职工会中央理事会主席库兹涅佐夫说：每个心中热爱着和平事业的人，都晓得：只有以人类伟大的天才斯大林同志所领导的苏联作为先锋的强有力的民主阵营，才能与战争贩子及民主自由的扼杀者相对抗。库兹涅佐夫又说：保卫和平的民主力量是强大的。这些力量被民主的工人阶级运动、殖民地与附属国家的民族解放斗争以及一切拥护和平与进步的平民所支持着。执行着苏维埃国度千百万职工意志的苏联职工会，将始终不渝而忠诚地为和平与各国间的友谊而斗争。
    莫斯科“加利伯”工厂卓越的领班、斯大林奖金的荣获者罗西斯基说：象每一个苏联工人一样，我确实知道，我们所制造的每一件东西，都使我们的祖国更加强大，使全世界的和平更加巩固。（这些话语被一致的掌声所淹没了）我们不愿而且也不许战争干扰我们建设性的劳动和消灭我们坚持不懈的工作底成果。
    乌克兰刻松州的斯大林集体农场主席利托夫钦科说：让一切反对和平的人们记着：苏联、人民民主国家和西方各国一切爱好和平的朋友，有足够的力量和决心击碎战争贩子的脊骨的。
    接着是苏联妇女反法西斯委员会主席波波娃发言。她说：我们苏联妇女同样地不要战争。我们永远也不会忘记我们死去的儿子、丈夫和兄弟，我们也将忘不了母亲和妻子的眼泪，和我们人民所遭受过的痛苦。我们没有忘掉城市和乡村所遭遇的蹂躏。波波娃号召各国妇女在争取和平的斗争中巩固国际团结，无情地揭穿战争贩子。
