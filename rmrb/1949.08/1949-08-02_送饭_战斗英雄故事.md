    Delivering Food
    Story of a Combat Hero
    He Pengji
    The soldiers of the Fourth Company hadn't had water or hot food for three days. They were holding back the stubborn Fifth Army in the trenches, engaging in bayonet charges more than ten times a day. During breaks in the fighting, they ate the dry cornbread they carried to stave off hunger. The most difficult thing was not having water to drink, and being baked by the sun and bombarded by artillery, which made them feel dizzy.
    The cook, Old Zhao (Yongsheng), carrying a load of snow-white wheat noodles in buckets, risked the strafing of airplanes from five miles away. When he was only fifty or sixty meters from the trenches, the enemy's attack began. A shell landed, and a fragment struck a hole about the size of a coin in one of the buckets, and the broth started to leak out. Old Zhao was very worried. Ignoring the wounds on his body and arms, he hurriedly plugged the hole with his hand. In his eyes, losing a drop of broth was more important and regrettable than losing his own blood. So, he endured the pain, crawling on the ground, pushing the bucket forward little by little. His hand was scalded by the soup, but he gritted his teeth, delivered this bucket, and then went back to get the other bucket. By the time the second bucket was brought into the trench, the first bucket had already been eaten. He smiled and said to the company commander, "I've completed my mission." "You are really brave! You've worked hard." The soldiers ate the noodles and drank the soup and said to him with admiration. "Ah! Didn't I come here to protect my home!" he replied contentedly. "Hey! What's going on with you?" The soldier Xiao Liu pointed to the blood on his jacket. "Ah!" He suddenly remembered the wounds on his body. He took off his clothes and saw that there were already five bleeding places.

    送饭
    战斗英雄故事
    何朋辑
    四连的战士们已经三天没喝水，没吃热的东西了，在战壕里阻击顽五军，每天总有十几次拚刺刀，抽着战斗空隙，吃着自己袋里的干馍馍充饥，最困难的是没有水喝、又被太阳晒着，炮火轰着，弄得头昏昏的。
    炊事员老赵（永胜），从五里路外挑着一担用桶盛着的雪白洋面面条子，冒着飞机的扫射，刚到战壕有五六十米的时候，敌人的进攻开始了，一个炮弹过来，弹片刚巧就把一只桶上打了有洋钱那么大个洞，汤从里面流出来，老赵心里可急坏了，也不管身上和膀子上的伤，慌忙用手塞着洞，在他看来流出一滴面汤比自己的血还重要，还可惜，于是他忍着痛在地下爬一步，把桶慢慢的向前推一步，手被汤烫破了，他紧咬着牙，把这桶送去，又回来弄那桶，到第二桶一起弄进战壕，第一桶已吃光了，他笑着对连长说：“我完成任务了。”“你真勇敢！辛苦了。”战士们吃了面喝了汤敬佩的对他说。“唉！我还不是为了保家才来的呀！”他满意的答道。“喂！你这怎么搞的呀？”战士小刘指着他的褂子上的血说。“啊！”他一下想起了他身上的伤，把衣服脱下来一看，身上已经有五处流血了。
