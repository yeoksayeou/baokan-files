(Ping Municipal News) The spokesperson for the Democratic National Construction Association in Peiping recently released a written statement regarding the White Paper from the US State Department. The full text is as follows:

Just as the People's Liberation Army is victoriously advancing toward South China, Southwest China, and Northwest China, the imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries are colluding in blockade schemes, and as Stuart's efforts fail and he dejectedly returns home, the US State Department has published a White Paper on Sino-US relations. Why did Truman and Acheson choose this moment to publish the White Paper? It is to express their innermost feelings to the eight major groups of American monopoly capitalists, to conceal their failure to avoid losing favor; to deceive the American people so they don't feel the money the US imperialists spent in China was wasted; and to threaten the Chinese people and give a shot in the arm to the dying Chinese reactionaries. What is the actual effect of the publication? In our view, besides exposing the US imperialists' ambition to continue to invade China and raising the Chinese people's vigilance against the US imperialists' instigation of the Fifth Column, this White Paper really has no other function.

A noteworthy point in the White Paper is the conspiracy to support so-called "democratic individualists." Where does the US imperialists look to find these "democratic individualists"? Judging from the White Paper, it seems to have little hope for Guangzhou and Taiwan today and little hope of creating "democratic individualists" there. Guangzhou and Taiwan are full of the US imperialists' direct tools, not disguised tools like "democratic individualists." The Americans' flirtations extend far and wide, possibly hoping to find a confidant or two within our People's Democratic United Front. Among the four friends participating in the construction of New China, the working class and peasantry, who have been fighting the US imperialists all along, are probably not the target. In the eyes of the US imperialists, maybe the national bourgeoisie or the petty bourgeoisie are worth trying to influence. Thank you for the reminder, US imperialists, we should greatly strengthen internal unity and vigilance. However, there is one thing we must tell the US imperialists: the good dream of developing "democratic individualism" mentioned in the White Paper will not come true. Take the Chinese national bourgeoisie, for example. I'm sorry to say, if they are regarded as good targets, then the US imperialists will make another mistake.

Chinese National Bourgeoisie Will Not Become a Tool of the US Imperialists

The contradiction between the basic interests of the Chinese national bourgeoisie and imperialism determines its attitude towards all imperialists (including the US imperialists). From its inception on the historical stage, the Chinese national bourgeoisie has been subjected to feudal obstruction and imperialist destruction, the latter being particularly serious. The dim page in China's history of the last hundred years is also a page where the Chinese national bourgeoisie has suffered all kinds of imperialist blows. Under the high pressure of the imperialists, a part of the bourgeoisie wavered and became direct or indirect tools for imperialism to carry out economic aggression and colonization, that is, the so-called comprador bourgeoisie and bureaucratic bourgeoisie; another part, on the economic front, carried out a certain degree of anti-imperialist struggle, that is, the more pure national bourgeoisie that has been tested. Its journey is arduous. Take the last few years of the Kuomintang reactionaries' rule as an example, there was a danger of losing "assets" to preserve "nationality." But it is precisely this kind of test that has transformed and improved the quality of the Chinese national bourgeoisie. It also understands that following the Chinese Communist Party, carrying out the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, finally gaining liberation and recovering from despair. What will happen in the future? The New Democratic economic policies are clearly defined: private industry and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood will be greatly developed. Based on past experience and future observations, the Chinese national bourgeoisie will not become capital or a condition for the US imperialists to develop "democratic individualism" based on any aspect. Only New Democracy is its only bright and happy path. Regarding the direction of the entire world and New China, the Chinese national bourgeoisie should not and will not misjudge it.

Merely recognizing the direction is not enough. We must also prepare for struggle, struggle to smash the enemy's blockade, struggle to eliminate all the disasters imposed on us by the US imperialists, and struggle to build a New Democratic China! We are not afraid of all the conspiracies and intimidation of the imperialists, and we are confident and certain of victory in the struggle. Domestically, we have the leadership of the Communist Party, the cooperation and efforts of the broad and strong People's Democratic United Front; internationally, we have the socialist Soviet Union, the New Democratic fraternal countries led by the Soviet Union, and the concern and mutual assistance of the broad masses of people and progressive people in all countries (including the United States). What difficulties are we afraid of not overcoming! Indeed, we have overcome the difficulties of the past witnessed by the one thousand and fifty-four pages. The future conditions will only become more and more favorable to us. We will definitely be able to overcome difficulties and accomplish our tasks.

### 加强内部团结和警惕　答告美帝好梦做不成  民主建国会在平发言人痛斥白皮书

　　加强内部团结和警惕
  　答告美帝好梦做不成
    民主建国会在平发言人痛斥白皮书
    【平市讯】民主建国会在平发言人，顷对美国国务院的白皮书，发表书面谈话，全文如下：
    正当人民解放军向华南、西南、西北胜利进军，帝国主义者和国民党反动派合串封锁的把戏，司徒雷登一筹莫展，懊丧回国的时候，美国国务院发表了中美关系的白皮书。杜鲁门、艾奇逊选择这个时机发表白皮书，为的是什么？为的是对美国独占资本家八大集团表明衷曲，掩饰失败，免得失宠；为的是欺骗美国人民，使他们不觉得美帝在中国花的钱是白扔的；为的是对中国人民来一次威胁，并且给奄奄一息的中国反动派打一针强心针。发表了的实际效果怎么样呢？依我们看来，除掉暴露美帝继续侵略中国的野心和提高中国人民对美帝策动第五纵队的警觉以外，这一份白皮书实在找不出还有什么其他的作用。
    白皮书里比较值得注意的一点是扶植所谓“民主个人主义者”的阴谋诡计。美帝所企求的“民主个人主义者”在什么地方去找呢？从白皮书看，它对于今天的广州台湾等处似乎已经不存多大希望，不存制造“民主个人主义者”的希望。广州台湾等地有的是美帝的直接工具，不是象“民主个人主义者”那样伪装的工具。美人的秋波送得远得很呢，可能妄想在我们人民民主统一战线中找个把知心的人。在参与建设新中国的四个朋友中，和美帝一直战斗着的工农阶级大概不是对象，在美帝看来，在民族资产阶级或小资产阶级中，或者还有主意好打。谢谢美帝的提醒，我们应该大大加强内部的团结和警惕，但有一点，我们是非要答告美帝不可的，白皮书上所提的发展“民主个人主义”的好梦是做不成的。就拿中国民族资产阶级来说吧，抱歉得很，如果把他们当做好对象，那美帝又将多犯一次错误了。
　　中国民族资产阶级不会变成美帝工具
    中国民族资产阶级和帝国主义基本利益的矛盾决定了它对一切帝国主义（包括美帝在内）的态度。从它在历史舞台上出现一开始，中国民族资产阶级就受到封建的阻碍和帝国主义的摧残，后者的为害尤其严重。中国近百年史中黯淡的一页也就是中国民族资产阶级受尽帝国主义打击的一页。在帝国主义者的高压下，一部分的资产阶级动摇了，变成为帝国主义进行经济侵略，进行殖民地化的直接或间接的工具，这就是所谓买办资产阶级和官僚资产阶级；另一部分呢，在经济战线上进行了某些程度的反帝斗争，这就是经过考验，比较纯正的民族资产阶级。它的历程是艰苦的，以国民党反动派统治最后的几年为例吧，几乎保全了“民族”，就有丧失“资产”的危险。可也正是这样的考验，改造了、提高了中国民族资产阶级的品质。它也懂得跟着中国共产党走，进行了反帝、反封建、反官僚资本的斗争，终于获得解放，从绝望中复苏回来。今后怎么样，新民主主义的经济政策订得明明白白，有利于国计民生的私人工商业，会大大的发展。根据过去的经验和今后的观察，中国民族资产阶级凭哪一条也不会变成美帝发展“民主个人主义”的资本或条件。只有新民主主义，才是它唯一的光明幸福的道路。对于整个世界和新中国的方向，中国的民族资产阶级是不应该也不会认错的。
    单单认清方向，这还不够，我们还得准备斗争，为粉碎敌人的封锁而斗争，为消灭美帝所加于我们的一切灾难而斗争，为建设新民主主义的中国而斗争！我们不怕帝国主义者的一切阴谋恫吓，对于斗争的胜利我们是有信心、有把握的。在国内，我们有共产党的领导，广大坚强的人民民主统一战线的合作和努力；在国际，我们有社会主义的苏联、苏联所领导的新民主主义兄弟国家，以及所有国家（包括美国在内）里广大人民和进步人士的关切与互助，还怕有什么困难不能克服！真的，为一千零五十四页所见证的过去的困难，我们都战胜过来了，今后的条件，对我们只有一天比一天有利，我们是一定能够克服困难，达成任务的。
