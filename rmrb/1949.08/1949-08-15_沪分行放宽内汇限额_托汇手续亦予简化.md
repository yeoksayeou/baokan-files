    Shanghai Branch Relaxes Domestic Remittance Limit
    Remittance Procedures Also Simplified
    [Further News] The Shanghai Branch previously limited domestic remittance amounts to no more than 500,000 yuan to regulate finance and stabilize prices. Now, considering the gradual normalization of financial exchange between urban and rural areas, and taking into account that various factories purchase raw materials from other locations, the branch has relaxed the limit. The previous method of submitting documents to the Industry and Commerce Department for review and payment of supporting documents has also been abolished. Now, the remitting customer only needs to write a remittance application to the branch, stating the reason, and after approval, the remittance can be processed. It is reported that recently, many Shanghai yarn factories have remitted funds to Zhengzhou to purchase cotton. This reflects that the supply of raw cotton for Shanghai yarn factories is promising and that the flow of materials between the city and the interior has become smooth. For yarn factories applying for remittances to the branch, if they have a purchase certificate approved and issued by the Industry and Commerce Department, the branch can handle the exchange procedures according to the head office's allocation situation.

    沪分行放宽内汇限额
    托汇手续亦予简化
    【又讯】上海分行前为调节金融，稳定物价，曾限制内汇额不得超过五十万元。现该行鉴于城乡金融交流渐趋正常，并顾及各工厂向外埠购进原料，特将限额放宽，过去呈请工商处审核并缴证明文件办法亦予废止，仅需要汇款户写一汇款申请书向该行申明理由，经认可后即可照汇。据悉：日前本市纱厂向郑州方面汇出采购棉花款项很多，这反映本市纱厂原棉供应有望，也反映城市与内地物资流通状况已趋顺利。凡纱厂向该行申请汇款，有工商处核准发给之采购证，该行即可按头寸调拨情形，办理汇兑手续。
