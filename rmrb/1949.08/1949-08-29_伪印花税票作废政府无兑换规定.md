　　Fake Stamp Tax Stamps Voided; Government Has No Exchange Policy
    Regarding the stamp tax from the time of the fake Kuomintang rule, has it been invalidated? Does the state have any exchange or endorsement regulations for these fake stamps? 　　

(Li Wenming)

Mr. Li Wenming:

    Regarding your question about whether fake stamp tax stamps from the Kuomintang era can be exchanged, according to regulations, with the liberation of Peiping, the stamp tax stamps issued by the Kuomintang puppet government should become invalid with the demise of the puppet regime. Stamp tax stamps are different from currency, and people would not store them in large quantities. Therefore, after liberation, the use of fake stamp tax stamps was immediately discontinued, and there are no exchange regulations.

　　伪印花税票作废政府无兑换规定编辑同志：
    在伪国民党统治时的印花是否已作废？国家对此伪印花有没兑换，或签字之规定？  　　（李问明）李问明先生：
    你所问国民党时之伪印花能否兑换一节，按北平解放，国民党伪政府发行之印花税票，应随伪政权之消灭而归失效。印花税票与货币不同，人民不会大量存储，故解放后即停止伪印花税票使用，并无兑换之规定。
