Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 11th: TASS Vienna dispatch: On August 7th, a mass meeting was held in the Prater Park to celebrate the Austrian Communist Party's newspaper. The Chairman of the Austrian Communist Party, Koplenig, delivered a speech at the meeting, denouncing the visit of the US Army, Navy, and Air Force Chiefs of Staff to Austria, and welcoming young athletes from Western European countries participating in the "Peace Relay Race" passing through the country. Koplenig said: As we celebrate, we have the opportunity to welcome the relay race of young people from Britain, France, Italy, and Austria, who represent the emerging generation in Western Europe and are bringing a message of peace to the Budapest World Youth Festival. All the young people gathered there want peace. We hope that foreign countries will never be able to use Austria as an arsenal and bridgehead for launching new wars. Koplenig pointed out: Along with the youth relay race bringing the peace baton, another "baton" was also brought to Austria. This baton was brought by old generals wearing American military uniforms. They came to Austria as envoys of instigators of new wars and organizers of new disasters. The three American generals came to Vienna to negotiate with Figl, Schärf, and Gruber behind the backs of the Austrian people, in order to absorb Austria into the Western military bloc. Koplenig reminded the audience that the "gold-dollar grants" received by the Austrian authorities have increased the poverty of the people and filled the pockets of the wealthy. Today, the "generous" American gentlemen have revealed their cards. Today everyone sees what is hidden behind their so-called "gifts." They want to give us weapons and turn Austrians into their mercenaries. This is the purpose of the current visit of the American Chiefs of Staff. Koplenig emphasized: But the Austrian people, like the people of all countries, desire and demand peace. That is why we want to tell the American generals: "Get back to where you came from! Austria has long served as a pawn of foreign countries, but does not want to serve as one anymore. Keep your weapons and your war propaganda far away from us! Get out of Austria!" Koplenig finally called for the unity of all democratic forces in order to open up a path for the Austrian people to genuine democracy, peace and a better future. Koplenig's speech was repeatedly interrupted by prolonged applause and cheers.

    “滚回你们来的地方去！”
    奥共主席痛斥美战贩
    号召民主力量团结争取和平
    【新华社北平十一日电】塔斯社维也纳讯：八月七日，此间波雷特公园举行庆祝奥地利共产党报纸的群众大会，奥共主席柯普利尼希在会上发表演说，斥责美国陆海空军参谋长访奥，并欢迎西欧各国参加“和平棒”接力跑的青年选手过境。柯普利尼希说：在我们庆祝之际，我们有机会欢迎英、法、意、奥各国青年的接力跑，他们代表西欧新兴的一代，正给布达佩斯世界青年节带来呼吁和平的音信。所有集结在那里的青年都要和平。我们希望外国永不能利用奥地利作为发动新战争的兵工厂和桥头堡。柯普利尼希指出：与青年接力跑带来和平棒同时，另一个“棒”也被带到奥国来。这个棒是被穿着美国军装的年老的将军们带来的。他们是作为新战争的挑拨者和新灾祸的组织者的使节来到奥国的。三个美国将军到维也纳来，是想背着奥国人民，与费格尔、舒尔夫和格鲁伯进行谈判，将奥国吸收入西方军事集团。柯普利尼希提醒听众说，奥国当局接收的“金元赠予”增加了人民的穷困，并装满了阔人的口袋。今天“慷慨的”美国绅士们把牌摊出来了。今天人人看到在他们所谓“礼物”后面藏着的是什么。他们想给我们武器，而把奥地利人变成他们的佣兵。这便是美国参谋长们目前来访的目的。柯普利尼希强调说：但奥国人民与各国人民愿望并要求和平。这就是为什么我们要告诉美国将军们说：“滚回你们来的地方去！奥国很久以来充当外国的走卒，但现在不想再充当了。你们的武器和你们的战争宣传远离开我们吧！滚出奥地利去！”柯普利尼希最后号召团结一切民主势力，以便给奥国人民打开通往真正民主、和平与更好的将来的道路。柯普利尼希的演说屡次为经久不息的掌声与欢呼所打断。
