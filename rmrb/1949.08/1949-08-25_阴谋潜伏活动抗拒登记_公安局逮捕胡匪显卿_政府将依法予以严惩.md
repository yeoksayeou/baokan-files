　　Conspiracy and Subversive Activities Resist Registration
  　Public Security Bureau Arrests Bandit Hu Xianqing
    Government Will Punish Him Severely According to Law
    [This City News] Hu Xianqing, an execution committee member and secretary of the 6th District Party Branch of the Kuomintang Peiping Municipal Party Headquarters, a Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (CC Bureau) special agent, and an assembly organizer of the pseudo-Parliament, who conspired to carry out subversive activities and dared to resist registration, was arrested yesterday (the 24th) by the 6th Precinct of the People's Government Public Security Bureau. After the liberation of Beiping, this criminal took advantage of the opportunity to infiltrate our revolutionary organs, plotting to continue counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. The Military Control Commission twice issued proclamations ordering reactionary party members and special agents to register and start anew. This criminal attempted to hide and refused to register. Yesterday, when the 6th Precinct of the Public Security Bureau went to mobilize him to register at the bureau, this criminal still attempted to use personnel from revolutionary organs as a shield and took the People's Government's lenient policy as something to be exploited. He was arrogant and firmly refused to register. The People's Government will not tolerate this incorrigible special agent who is determined to be an enemy of the people, and immediately arrested him and will punish him severely according to the law.
