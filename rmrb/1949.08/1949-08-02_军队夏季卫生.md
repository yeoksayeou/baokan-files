    Army Summer Hygiene
    Zhong

    The most common diseases in summer are nothing more than the following: cholera, typhoid, dysentery, and other gastrointestinal diseases caused by unsanitary food and drink, such as abdominal pain (often a cause of straggling during marches), vomiting and diarrhea (often acute gastroenteritis). Malaria, transmitted by mosquito bites (commonly known as "bai zi," "men tou bai zi," and "miasma" in Yunnan and Guizhou, which is also a type of this disease). Heatstroke caused by prolonged exposure to strong sunlight. Past statistics have shown that these diseases often cause serious non-combat attrition in the troops, which not only affects the completion of combat missions but also harms our vital forces. These diseases are more likely to prevail in the Yangtze River basin. Therefore, our various field armies advancing into the south of the Yangtze River should strengthen summer epidemic prevention work. Past experience has proven that if leaders from the military and political levels down to the soldiers can all attach importance to prevention work and complete hygiene work as a task, coupled with the specific guidance of health personnel, the occurrence and harm of these diseases can be reduced or avoided.
    To prevent cholera, typhoid, dysentery, and other gastrointestinal diseases, the first thing to pay attention to is food hygiene. More importantly, do not drink raw water, do not use raw water to rinse your mouth, wash dishes, or eat fruits, vegetables, cold noodles, sour plum soup...etc., that have been in contact with raw water. There is no clean raw water on the ground. Whether it is river water, lake water, pond water, or well water, it is often contaminated by feces. If it is not boiled or disinfected with chemicals such as bleaching powder, it will cause acute gastrointestinal infectious diseases. The key is to persuade people to change their habit of drinking raw water. Some people often think: "I've been drinking it for half my life, it doesn't matter. Let me drink a sip to feel refreshed before we talk." This is because they do not believe that there are bacteria in raw water and the relationship between drinking raw water and disease. Patient and tireless repeated propaganda is very important. In the past, showing soldiers the protozoa contained in a drop of natural water under a microscope to prove that what appears to be clean water to the naked eye actually contains microorganisms has been quite effective. Preparing a large amount of boiled water, or preferably cold boiled water, before marching and camping is a more proactive approach. When marching, carry water bottles, or have the company dispatch advance stations every 30 to 50 li to set up boiled water stations (preferably cold boiled water stations). Some units of the First Field Army have done this well by having health personnel work with management personnel to mobilize the masses.
    Unclean food is also a vector for disease transmission. Food that has been touched by flies, stale food, and cold dishes prepared without hygienic methods should not be eaten. The kitchen should prevent flies from entering as much as possible and prevent flies from touching food as much as possible. The kitchen should be kept clean and tidy. If a cook suffers from an infectious disease, he should not be asked to cook. In order to implement these measures, it is necessary to adopt the method of short-term training of cooks in Yan'an in the past. Doctors can personally go to the kitchen to assist the cooks in cooking and teaching hygiene. Hygiene should also be added as a criterion for cooks to receive merit.
    Before camping in a village or town, or after occupying a town, the health authorities should send capable personnel to investigate the types and conditions of diseases with the local people and doctors in order to detect and isolate patients early, disinfect their feces, and avoid our troops living with patients, which may lead to infection. If patients are found in the troops, they should also be isolated early, and their feces should be disinfected with lime or bleaching powder.
    In order to reduce the harm of flies, it is necessary to publicize and promote the movement to kill flies, kill maggots, and prevent flies. Assisting local governments and the masses to launch summer cleaning campaigns or general cleanups, disposing of garbage and sewage, and removing dirt are also important measures. In the south, washing vegetables, rinsing rice, washing clothes, and washing chamber pots in the same river is a very important cause of disease transmission. The harm of this method should be publicized, and it should be gradually and properly improved through the masses.
    More importantly, all commanders and fighters should be injected with preventive vaccines, preferably a mixed vaccine against cholera, typhoid, and paratyphoid, with three injections per person, each injection one week apart, for a total of 2.5 cc. This can provide solid immunity against typhoid and cholera. However, it is necessary to strengthen propaganda before the injection and organize injections in batches to avoid reactions after the injection, which may make people think that they are "looking for trouble when they are not sick," and refuse to receive the second injection. The injection should be as widespread as possible, and each person should not only receive one injection. The vaccine produced by the Beijing Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Center is safe and reliable and can be ordered in large quantities.
    Malaria is also a common disease in the south. Some people think that it is a disease that everyone cannot avoid, but this is not true. However, the prevention of malaria is more difficult than the above-mentioned gastrointestinal infectious diseases. The most important prevention methods are to kill mosquitoes and larvae, prevent mosquitoes, eradicate patients, and take medicine for prevention. We may still be able to do all of these universally in the short term. But if we can publicize and assist the masses in dredging ditches and stagnant water to eliminate breeding grounds for larvae, and also use the method of spraying oil and drugs on the water surface, it can only be done when conditions permit. The methods of using mosquito nets and using wormwood or pyrethrum to fumigate mosquitoes at night can be strived to be achieved. As for the methods of eradicating and treating patients and using drugs for prevention, the health authorities need to decide on a plan and implement it under possible conditions.
    The prevention method for heatstroke during marches in the scorching sun is to use a straw hat, or make a hat from green leaves and branches. It is best to wear black glasses to prevent the sun from directly shining on the head and eyes. Do not drink alcohol before marching. Constipation is also one of the causes of heatstroke. It is best to wear loose clothing and not button it too tightly. It is best to carry lighter things. Increase the number of rest times on the road during daytime marches. If there is no urgent task when the weather is too hot at noon, it is best to take a nap. When marching in summer, prepare water containing a small amount of salt and drink more along the way to replenish the water and salt lost through sweat. Heatstroke prevention medicines such as Rendan and Xingjun Dan are mostly not very effective, so it is best not to use them.
    The above is just a brief mention of army summer hygiene. For detailed and specific methods, the health departments of each field army need to formulate them according to the specific situation. Here, we just want to remind commanders, fighters, health personnel, logistics, and supply personnel to pay attention. However, to seriously carry out the army's summer hygiene movement, it must be launched by the military and political leaders and specifically publicized and organized by the health authorities. To do this well, it is necessary to establish a working policy of prevention first in health personnel and health authorities at all levels, and to correct the past style of work that paid more attention to the wounded and not enough research to the sick, and the style of work that emphasized surgery and treatment and neglected prevention and propaganda. What is more needed is not to act after the disease occurs, but to have adequate preparation and vigilance beforehand. Go to the healthy soldiers, care about their diet and life, and do not just consider the task completed by going to the patients for treatment. To truly achieve the protection of the vital forces and health of the troops, it is necessary to attach importance to and promote various hygiene movements in the troops in addition to battlefield rescue, care, and treatment.

    军队夏季卫生
    中
    夏季最常见的疾病，不外以下几种：因吃喝不卫生而得的霍乱、伤寒、痢疾及其他胃肠病如腹痛（常为行军掉队的原因之一），吐泻（常为急性胃肠炎）。由蚊虫叮咬而传染的疟疾（俗名摆子，闷头摆子，云贵一带的瘴气也是这病的一种）。因久受强烈日光曝晒而得的中暑。这几种病根据过去的统计，常给部队以严重的非战斗减员，不只影响战斗任务的完成，而且伤害我们的有生力量。这几种病在长江流域更易盛行，因此进军江南的我各路野战大军，尤应加强夏季防疫工作。过去的经验证明：如自军政首长到战士都能重视预防工作，而把卫生工作当成一个任务来完成，再加上卫生人员的具体指导，便可减少或避免这些疾病的发生和危害。
    预防霍乱、伤寒、痢疾及其他胃肠病，第一要注意饮食卫生。更重要的是不喝生水，不用生水漱口，洗碗筷，或吃粘有生水的瓜果，生菜，凉粉，酸梅汤……等。地面上没有洁净的生水，不管河水，湖水，塘水，井水，常被粪便所污染。如不煮开，或经漂白粉一类的药品消毒过，便会使人得急性的胃肠传染病。问题的中心是要说服一般人使他们改掉喝生水的习惯。常有人认为：已经喝了半辈子了，不要紧，喝一口通快一下再讲。这是由于他们不相信生水中有细菌，和喝生水与疾病的关系。耐心的不疲倦的反复宣传是很重要的。过去给战士们，用显微镜看一滴天然水所含的草履虫，以证明肉眼看来是清水，而实际含有微生物的办法，收效不小。不管行军、宿营都应事前准备大量的开水，可能时准备凉开水，是更积极的办法。行军时带水壶，或以连为单位的派遣前站，每隔三、五十里设开水站（最好是冷开水站）。一野战军有些部队由卫生人员协同管理人员发动群众这样做到了是好的。
    不洁的食物，也是病的传染媒介。如苍蝇叮过的食物，不新鲜的饭菜，不以卫生方法作的冷拌菜，都不能吃。厨房内要尽量的防止苍蝇进入，尽量防止苍蝇叮食物。厨房要维持清洁整齐。伙夫如患了传染病就千万不要再叫他作饭。为了贯彻这些办法，必需采取过去延安短期训练伙夫的办法，医生亲自下厨房，协助伙夫作饭讲卫生的办法都可采用。伙夫的立功标准也应加入卫生一项。
    每到一村镇宿营之前，或攻占一个城镇后，卫生机关均应派遣得力人员，向当地老百姓及医生，调查发病种类及情形，以便早期发现并隔离患者，消毒他的粪便，并避免我们部队与病人同住，而致传染。部队内有病人发现，也应早期隔离，并以石灰或漂白粉等消毒他的粪便。
    为了减少苍蝇的危害，宣传并推行灭蝇灭蛆防蝇运动是必要的。协助当地政府和群众，发动夏令清洁运动或大扫除，处理垃圾、污水，清除污物，也是很重要的措施。南方通常在一条河中洗菜，淘米，洗衣，洗马桶的办法，是传染疾病的很重要的原因之一，应加强宣传这种办法的危害，通过群众，逐步的妥善的加以改善。
    更重要的是给所有的指战员注射预防针，最好注射霍乱、伤寒、副伤寒混合菌苗，每人注射三针，每针相隔一星期，共二、五西西。这样可以得到对伤寒霍乱病巩固的免疫力。但注射前必需加强宣传，并组织分批注射。免致注射后的反应，使人认为是“没病找病”，以致拒绝注射第二次。注射应力求普遍，每人不要只打一针便了事。北平天坛防疫处出品的菌苗，安全可靠，可以大批定购。
    疟疾，也是南方的多发病，有些人认为是人人不能避免得的病，其实不对。不过疟疾的预防法是较以上的胃肠传染病困难一些。最重要的预防法是灭蚊灭孑孓，防蚊，根治病人，及吃药预防，我们现在都还可能在短期内普遍的作到的。但如能宣传并协助群众输通沟渠，死坑水，以铲除孑孓孳生地，还可以利用在水面上洒油类及药物的办法，只能在条件允许的时候办了。用蚊帐及用艾或除虫菊夜间薰蚊子的办法，是可以争取办到的。至于除根的治疗病人及用药物预防的办法，则需由卫生机关在可能的条件下，决定方案推行。
    在烈日当空时行军中中暑的预防法，是可用草帽，或用绿叶树枝编成帽子，最好是带上黑色眼镜，这样可以防止烈日直射头眼。行军前不可吃酒，壶最好通便便秘亦为中暑诱因之一，衣服最好轻松一些，不可扣的太紧，背的东西最好轻些，白天行军在路上，增多休息次数，中午天气过热，如没有最急迫的任务，最好歇一下晌。在夏天行军时应准备含少量盐的水，在路上多喝，以补充由汗失去的水份及盐。避暑药如仁丹，行军丹，大多没有多大作用，最好不用。
    这以上只是简单的提了一下夏季军队卫生。要详细的具体办法，还需各野战军卫生部根据具体情况来订，这里只是提起指战员，卫生人员，后勤及供给人员的注意。但要认真的开展军队的夏季卫生运动，必须由军政首长发动，由卫生机关具体的宣传组织。要办好这事，必需在各级卫生人员及卫生机关中，树立预防为主的工作方针，并要纠正过去比较更多重视伤员，不够钻研病号的作风，及重手术及治疗，轻预防及宣传的作风。更需要不等有病发生再动作，应在事前有充分的准备及警惕。到健康人的战士中去，关心他们的饮食、生活，而不只是到病人那里去作治疗工作便算完成任务。真正要达到保护部队的有生力量及健康，则必须除了作战场救护及治疗外，重视并推动部队中各种的卫生运动才成。
