    Public Security Bureau of Beiping Municipality Holds Anti-Espionage and Public Security Exhibition
    [Beiping News] The Anti-Espionage and Public Security Exhibition, organized by the Public Security Bureau of the Beiping Municipal People's Government, opened yesterday (the 13th) at the Water Pavilion in Zhongshan Park. Representatives from all sectors of Beiping and citizens were invited. The exhibits not only demonstrate the achievements of the Public Security Bureau in the past six months in anti-espionage, public security, and the establishment of revolutionary order, but also fully expose the sabotage conspiracies and crimes of reactionary Kuomintang agents against national wealth and the people's lives and property, which should arouse high vigilance among the broad masses of the people. The exhibition is divided into two parts: anti-espionage and public security, with four exhibition rooms. In the anti-espionage section, exhibits included information and evidence from major cases in the past six months involving organized riots, sabotage under false pretenses, economic disruption, robbery and assassination plots by Kuomintang reactionary agents, as well as cases involving imperialist international spies and Xu Huidong, the chief culprit of the "July 5th" bloody incident. Espionage tools such as assassination weapons, radios, documents, and files were displayed separately. In addition, photographs illustrated the lives of agents undergoing training and management in the Qinghe Brigade, as well as wall newspapers and cartoons written by the agents themselves, describing the bloody crimes they committed and their learning and transformation process. In the public security section, systematic charts and statistics were widely presented on robbery, theft, traffic, fire, and sanitation. Photographs of bandits injuring and killing victims, as well as the weapons they used, were also displayed. To facilitate visits by the general public, arrangements have been made with Zhongshan Park to offer half-price admission during the exhibition period.
