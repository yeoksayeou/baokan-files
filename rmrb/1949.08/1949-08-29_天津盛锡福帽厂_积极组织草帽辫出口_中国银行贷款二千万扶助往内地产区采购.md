Tianjin Shengxifu Hat Factory

　　Actively Organizes Straw Braid Exports
    Bank of China Provides 20 Million Yuan Loan to Support Procurement in Inland Production Areas

　　[Tianjin News] This city's Shengxifu Hat Factory was established in the first year of the Republic of China. In addition to making seasonal hats to supply retail sales in the city and wholesale sales in other areas, it also has an import and export department, engaged in the export of straw hat braids and the import of hat-making raw materials such as Australian wool, dyes, and hat materials. The factory's straw braid exports are partly purchased in this city and partly directly procured from production areas in Shandong (Ye County, Pingdu, Changyi), Hebei (Qing County, Xingji, Nanle, Xinzhuang, Qingfeng, etc.) and other provinces. Before liberation, annual exports were about four or five hundred bales. After liberation, under the encouragement of the People's Government, the factory has been striving to restore exports and plans to strive to exceed the pre-liberation annual export figures before the end of the year. As of the end of July, 200 bales of straw braids have been exported, worth approximately US$20,000. At the end of June, the factory reached an agreement with the Bank of China to borrow 10 million yuan using woolen hat bodies as collateral. It successively purchased more than 40 bales of floral straw braids in Ye County, Shandong, and more than 50 bales of raw straw braids in Xinzhuang, Nanle and other places in Hebei Province, all of which were shipped to Tianjin in early August. In addition, it purchased 10 bales of Xingji white grass braids and 10 bales of raw grass braids in this city, totaling more than 110 bales. The price, including all expenses, is approximately 21 million yuan. It is estimated that exporting them will bring back US$8,000. The factory has now obtained foreign letters of credit, and the goods can be exported after being sorted in Tianjin. On the 18th of this month, the Bank of China continued to lend the factory a second batch of 10 million yuan, still using woolen hat bodies as collateral, to continue purchasing straw braids for export from the production areas. The Bank of China's loan to the factory not only specifically solved the factory's export funding difficulties, but also reduced export costs.
