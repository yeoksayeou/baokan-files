    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Sixth District Communist Youth League's new members' induction ceremony was held at 8:00 PM on the 7th in the auditorium of the Xiangshan Children's Welfare Institute. A total of fifty-four League members took the oath, of whom workers accounted for three-fifths, with the remainder being students, members of the public, and cadres. In addition to all League members in the district, participants included students from six workers' night schools, employees of Zhongshan Park, and employees of the Xiangshan Children's Welfare Institute, totaling over 600 people. Representatives from the Municipal Communist Youth League Committee, the District Committee, and the Public Security Bureau attended, providing guidance and delivering encouraging speeches. The new League members felt boundless honor and expressed their determination to work hard in production, take the lead as role models, and seize the time to study politics, culture, and science. After the new League members took the oath, students from Si Cun Girls' Middle School performed a rice planting yangko dance, and a film was shown for entertainment. (Yang Ruoxian)
