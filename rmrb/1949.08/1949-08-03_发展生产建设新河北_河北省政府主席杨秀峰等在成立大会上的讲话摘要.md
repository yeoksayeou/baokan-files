    Develop Production and Construction in a New Hebei
    Excerpts from speeches by Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, and others at the founding conference
    [Baoding Electric] This reporter Chen Ji reports: The founding conference of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Government, the Military Region, and the Preparatory Committee of Mass Organizations of Hebei Province was solemnly held at the public stadium in Baoding City on the 1st. More than 5,000 people from all levels of the Party, government, military, and civilians in Hebei Province and Baoding City attended the meeting. After Luo Yuchuan, Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, delivered the opening remarks, Lin Tie, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke, saying: The formal establishment of Hebei Province is a major event of historical significance, marking the complete victory of the line led by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the victory of the complete liberation of North China and the imminent complete liberation of the whole country. The Communist Party and the people of Hebei Province have a glorious tradition of struggle. In the past 20 years of revolutionary struggle, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, they defeated the heinous Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Today, North China has been completely liberated. Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the specific leadership and timely assistance of the North China Bureau and the North China People's Government, our province and the Party will further and uniformly build a new Hebei Province. The basic policy for the next two or three years is: to restore and develop industrial and agricultural production in all regions step by step and with considerable planning, and to conscientiously implement the policy of facing all directions; at present, we must make great efforts to focus on restoring and developing agricultural production first. All industrial and commercial towns should actively restore and develop industries, transportation, and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and supply farmers with urgently needed living and production materials as soon as possible and in large quantities, and appropriately supply new-style production tools for rural areas. Rural areas should supply cities with grain and raw materials to prepare conditions for the development of industry. In newly liberated areas, the elimination of the feudal land system should be completed this winter and next spring. Next, Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, spoke, and put forward four principles for what the Hebei Provincial People's Government should do and how to do it in the future: (1) In accordance with Chairman Mao's policy of facing all directions, restore and develop industrial and agricultural production, and first have a considerable plan to cooperate with urban industrial production, especially to support the development of agricultural production in the two major cities of Tianjin and Beijing. To this end, we must vigorously control rivers and prevent floods, build water conservancy projects, increase fertilizers, breed livestock, organize labor mutual assistance under the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and encourage the development of promising handicrafts. (2) Vigorously restore and develop national cultural, educational, and health undertakings. First, we must run normal schools, middle schools, and vocational schools well, and we must restore, rectify, and develop primary schools, paying special attention to enabling children of poor workers and peasants to attend school. In terms of health, we should focus on epidemic prevention and midwifery medical facilities, and try to cultivate veterinary work. (3) In order to smoothly promote production and construction, we must vigorously eliminate the hidden Kuomintang reactionary remnants in urban and rural areas. (4) To ensure the completion of tasks, we must further strengthen organization and discipline. The comrades of the Hebei Provincial Government must conscientiously implement the orders and instructions of the North China People's Government and the system of requesting instructions and reporting, and establish the idea that subordinates should obey superiors. Sun Yi, Commander of the Hebei Provincial Military Region, spoke about the issue of suppressing bandits and maintaining public order, pointing out that the policy of suppressing bandits and maintaining public order in the new areas should be to rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, organize the masses, and combine various forces to suppress bandits. In the old areas, it is necessary to adjust the organization, reorganize the militia, strengthen social management, and educate the masses on the spirit of the rule of law. In addition to suppressing bandits, maintaining public order, and protecting production, another task for local troops and militia forces in the future is to strengthen technical and tactical training and gradually develop in the direction of the national defense forces. Mr. Li Xijiu, member of the Hebei Provincial Government, stated that under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, the various construction tasks of Hebei Province will surely be completed victoriously. Yu Li, member of the Provincial Government and Director of the Hebei Provincial People's Supervision Institute, Zhang Qingchun, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, Qi Yiding, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, Qing Hua, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Hebei Provincial Women's Federation, and others spoke successively, expressing their determination to struggle for the construction of a new Hebei. Finally, the conference sent a telegram of tribute to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference, the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the North China People's Government, and the North China Military Region.
