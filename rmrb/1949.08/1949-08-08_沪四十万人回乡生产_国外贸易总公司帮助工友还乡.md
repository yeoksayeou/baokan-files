    【Shanghai News】In the two months since the liberation of Shanghai, approximately 400,000 refugees have been evacuated from Shanghai to their hometowns. Among them, 200,000 returned voluntarily, and approximately 200,000 were sent back by the government and relief organizations. Of Shanghai's six million people, approximately 650,000 are impoverished, 170,000 are unemployed vagrants, and 100,000 are landlords, despots, and rich peasants who fled. Yesterday, the Civil Affairs Reception Office of the Political Affairs Takeover Committee continued to send 226 refugees back to their hometowns for production, including 118 from Huangpu District, 26 from North Sichuan Road District, and 82 from Xinjing District.
    Furthermore, workers at the China National Foreign Trade Corporation are enthusiastically responding to the call to return to their hometowns for production, overcoming temporary difficulties and voluntarily signing up to return. From the 1st to the 3rd, over 170 people completed the procedures for returning to their hometowns. The workers who completed the procedures believe that only by developing production, strengthening urban-rural ties, and ensuring smooth material exchange between urban and rural areas can we effectively smash the enemy's blockade. To take care of their families, the company provides subsidies to those with genuine difficulties, and also provides travel expenses as appropriate for those traveling long distances.

    又：国外贸易总公司的工友们，响应回乡生产，克服暂时的困难，自动的报名要求还乡生产的，极为踊跃。自一日开始到三日止，三天内已有一百七十多名，办理了回乡手续。办理回乡手续的工友们，都认为只有发展生产，加强城乡联系，使城乡间物资交流畅通，才是粉碎敌人封锁的好办法。公司为了照顾他们家庭，实在困难的，发给补助费，路途很远的，还酌情发给路费。
