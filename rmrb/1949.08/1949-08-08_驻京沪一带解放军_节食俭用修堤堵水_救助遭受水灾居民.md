Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th. The People's Liberation Army's Third Field Army direct units and the garrison troops stationed in Beijing, Shanghai, and surrounding areas are enthusiastically launching a savings and disaster relief campaign. After receiving instructions on saving for disaster relief, the political departments of the Field Army's various units conducted thorough ideological self-examinations and convened Revolutionary Servicemen's Committees, formulating plans for saving on water, electricity, and office supplies. To save on water and electricity, units have implemented unified lights-out policies at night and centralized office work, and are repairing water pipes to prevent leaks. The inspection team formed by the Revolutionary Servicemen's Committee of the headquarters strictly inspects the use of water and electricity. To save public expenditure, many cadres have voluntarily reduced their living standards, and some comrades have requested to suspend their health care allowances. The units directly under the headquarters unanimously resolved that, starting immediately, each person would save one ounce of rice per day for disaster relief for one month. The headquarters of a certain unit garrisoning Shanghai, except for the duty room and necessary street lights, all street lights are turned off at night; electric stoves in the political department are completely suspended, and the use of elevators is also restricted, with water consumption reduced from 7,000 gallons to 4,000 gallons per day; the unit's cultural troupe replaced 60-watt light bulbs with 15-watt and 20-watt bulbs. A certain army's direct units decided to repair old wells themselves; in addition to using tap water for drinking, well water is used for washing clothes and bathing, and the number of times porridge is eaten per week has been increased twice. In addition to practicing strict economy, the PLA units in various places continue to assist residents in rescuing from the floods. On July 25th, a certain unit stationed in Zhenjiang dispatched 2,500 officers and soldiers, 80 horse-drawn carts, and 6 trucks to rescue a total of 510,000 catties of rice and wheat from the riverside warehouses in the rain, and continued to dispatch hundreds of people to control the flood on the 26th and 27th. On the 26th, two battalions and direct units of the Second Regiment of a certain unit stationed in Nanjing dispatched all personnel to completely repair 1,500 feet of embankment west of Yishan Wharf under the scorching sun.

    救助遭受水灾居民
    【新华社上海六日电】人民解放军第三野战军直属队及驻京沪一带的警备部队，热烈展开节约救灾运动。野战军政治部各单位在接到关于节约救灾的指示后，普遍地进行了思想检查，召开了革命军人委员会，制订了水电及办公用品等项节约计划。各单位为了节省水电，已实行夜间统一熄灯和集中办公，并检修各处自来水管，防止漏水。司令部由革命军人委员会组成的检查组，严格检查水电使用。为了节省公家的开支，许多干部自动降低生活水平，有些同志要求停发自己的保健费。司令部直属队各单位一致决议，自即日起一个月内每人每日节约米一两救灾。警备上海的某部司令部夜间除值班室及必要路灯外，所有路灯一律熄灭；该部政治部电炉一律停用，电梯使用亦加以限制，用水由每天七千加仑减至四千加仑；该部文工团将六十支光的灯泡换为十五支和二十支的。某军直属队决定自己修理旧井，除吃水用自来水外，洗衣洗澡一律用井水，每星期吃稀饭次数增加两次。除厉行节约外，各地解放军并继续协助居民抢救水灾。驻镇江某部于七月二十五日出动指战员两千五百名、马车八十辆、卡车六辆、冒雨抢救江边堆栈等处米麦共五十一万斤，二十六、二十七两日继续出动数百人堵水。驻南京某部二团两个营及直属队二十六日全体出动，在烈日下将伊山码头以西一千五百尺的堤埝全部抢修完成。
