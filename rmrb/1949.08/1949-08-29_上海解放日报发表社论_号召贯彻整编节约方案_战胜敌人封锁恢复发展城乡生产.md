Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 28th. The Shanghai Liberation Daily published an editorial on the 17th, titled "Implement the Streamlining and Thrift Plan into Action." The editorial pointed out that the basic purpose of the plan is to strive to reduce our waste of manpower, materials, and financial resources, reduce the burden on the people, and, in conjunction with other tasks, gradually balance revenue and expenditure in finance. It also aims to use useful manpower, materials, and financial resources to support the front lines, develop rural work, improve urban-rural relations, so that we can steadily move forward, heal the war wounds suffered by the country for many years, gradually restore and develop urban and rural production, and enhance our strength to overcome the enemy's blockade and overcome difficulties.

In order to prevent deviations in policy when implementing this plan and to ensure that the streamlining and thrift movement can be sustained, the editorial believes: First, bloated and overlapping institutions must be reduced, but necessary production institutions and necessary work institutions must be strengthened. For progressive old employees retained by the takeover agencies, especially those experts and technical personnel, their scientific knowledge and technical talents should be respected, their lives should be cared for, and an attitude of love and help should be adopted to unite and transform them, thereby improving their enthusiasm and encouraging them to make progress. For old employees who are laid off, we should proceed from the long-term construction of the people's motherland and the unity and transformation of old personnel across the country to serve the people. We should solemnly and responsibly make proper arrangements according to different situations so that they can all find a way out for work, life, and study. They should be seen as valuable assets of the people's motherland and indispensable talents and cadres for new democratic construction. Any kicking aside and irresponsible attitude is extremely harmful. If individual departments have handled things improperly in the past, old personnel should be allowed to express their opinions and correct them in a timely manner. As for cadres who have been transferred from the original agencies and troops to go to the countryside, they should understand the great political significance of strengthening rural work today for long-term construction in the future. For other old, weak cadres and old, weak service personnel who cannot go to the countryside, it should be recognized that they have undergone long-term trials and tribulations and have made great contributions to the revolution. In the future, they will still be an important source for us to train construction cadres, and they should also be properly handled so that they can participate in certain production and construction and study.

Second, all waste in production, work, and life must be resolutely opposed; all unnecessary expenditures should be stopped; and all possible expenses should be saved. However, the minimum supply for the troops and all staff must be guaranteed. Expenditures necessary for work must be supplied, so that the current indispensable work can continue and the health of all personnel is not harmed. In particular, leading cadres of various agencies must pay great attention to and take care of the lives of soldiers and lower-level cadres. When adjusting salaries for those who receive salaries, those whose salaries do not match their positions should be adjusted first, and the phenomenon of excessive disparity should be gradually corrected. However, for those whose original salaries are too low, they should be able to maintain a minimum standard of living; for those who truly possess specialized knowledge and technical skills, they should still be appropriately maintained at a higher salary to prevent egalitarianism. The editorial specifically pointed out that it must be understood that the thrift movement is long-term and sustained. Today it is to break the enemy's blockade, and in the future it will be one of the main methods for us to accumulate construction funds and overcome difficulties during the entire construction period of our country. Therefore, in the thrift movement, all unsustainable excessive phenomena should be prevented.

The editorial finally called on the entire party, the entire army, and all comrades to consciously recognize the nature of the difficulties we face, and to recognize the necessity of self-reliance, overcoming difficulties, and the bright future. The editorial also pointed out that the biggest ideological obstacle and dangerous tendency is the corrupt and degenerate thinking that is budding and growing in individual cadres after entering new areas, especially after entering big cities. Such as paying attention to extravagance, admiring superficiality, despising the working class, the peasants' hard-working and simple class nature, pursuing personal enjoyment, and so on. Some people even think that "the revolution has succeeded, and it is time to enjoy it"; that "if you have made contributions to the party, it doesn't matter if you enjoy a little bit"; that "this is just a small problem in life, it doesn't matter." This kind of wrong understanding is most likely to corrupt the party and cadres, and most likely to paralyze and relax fighting spirit; if it is not overcome in time and allowed to grow unchecked, it will cause great damage to the party and the revolution. Overcoming this kind of thinking is a prerequisite for consolidating the party, consolidating the army, consolidating the people's democratic regime, and further improving cadres and implementing the streamlining and thrift movement today. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to carry out criticism and self-criticism within the party and within agencies and troops, with leaders taking the lead and with the democratic supervision of the broad masses of party members and the masses. The editorial called: The thrift movement should start with our Communist Party, the People's Government, and the People's Liberation Army. We should do it ourselves first, and then use this model behavior to influence and promote the entire people, so that everyone can economize on food and clothing, change the social atmosphere, and form a huge force to overcome difficulties, support the front lines, and promote national construction.

### 上海解放日报发表社论　号召贯彻整编节约方案  战胜敌人封锁恢复发展城乡生产

　　上海解放日报发表社论
  　号召贯彻整编节约方案
    战胜敌人封锁恢复发展城乡生产
    【新华社上海二十八日电】上海解放日报十七日发表社论，题为“贯彻整编节约方案到行动中去”。社论指出该方案的基本目的，在于力求减少我们在人力、物力、财力上的浪费，减轻人民负担，并配合其他各项工作，在财政上做到使收支逐步接近平衡，并将有用的人力、物力、财力用之于支援前线，并开展农村工作，搞好城乡关系，使我们能够稳步前进，医治国家多年来所受的战争创伤，逐步恢复和发展城乡生产，增强我们战胜敌人封锁、克服困难的力量。
    为着使得在执行这一方案时不致在政策上发生偏向，并使精简节约运动能够持久起见，社论认为：第一，臃肿重叠的机关必须裁减，但必要的生产机构与必要的工作机关必须加强。对接管机关留用的进步的旧员工，特别是对那些专门家技术人员，应当尊重他们的科学知识与技术才能，关心他们的生活，采取爱护和帮助的态度去团结和改造他们，以此提高他们的积极性和鼓励他们进步。对编余的旧员工，应当从人民祖国的长远建设及团结和改造全国旧人员为人民服务这一观点出发，郑重负责，分别不同情况，妥为安置；使他们都能够得到工作、生活和学习的出路。应当把他们看作人民祖国的宝贵财产及新民主主义建设不可缺少的人才和干部。任何一脚踢开、不负责任的态度都是极端有害的。过去个别部门处理不得当的，应允许旧人员提出意见，并及时予以纠正。至于对从原有机关和部队里抽调出来派遣下乡的干部，应当使他们了解今天加强农村工作，对于今后长期建设的重大政治意义。对其他不能下乡的老弱干部和老弱勤杂人员，应认识他们曾经过长期斗争考验，对革命有过很大贡献，今后仍然是我们培养建设干部的一个重要来源，同样要妥为处理，使他们能参加一定的生产建设和学习。
    第二，对一切生产上工作上及生活上的浪费都要坚决反对；一切不必要的开支，都应停止；一切可能节省的开支都应节省。但对部队及全体工作人员的最低限度的供给，必须保证。对工作必需的开支一定要供给。使当前必不可少的工作能够继续，全体人员的健康不致遭到损害。特别是各机关领导干部对战士和下层干部的生活，必须加以极大关心和照顾。对于领取薪水的人员，在调整薪给时，薪职不相称者应首先调整，过分悬殊的现象应当逐步改正。但对于原来薪给过低的人，应当使他们能够维持最低限度的生活；对确实具有专门知识和技术才能的人员，仍应适当维持较高的薪给，防止平均主义。社论特别指出：必须了解，节约运动是长期的、持久的。今天是为了打破敌人的封锁，今后则是我们国家整个建设时期内积累建设基金及克服困难的主要方法之一。因此，在节约运动中，一切不能持久的过火现象，都应当防止。
    社论最后号召全党全军全体同志自觉认识我们面前困难的性质，认识自力更生、克服困难的必要和光明的前途。社论并指出最大的思想障碍和危险倾向便是个别干部在进入新地区特别是进入大城市后，正在萌芽生长的腐化堕落思想。如讲究铺张，羡慕浮华，鄙视工人、农民刻苦简朴的阶级本色，追求个人享受等等。有些人甚至认为“革命成功了，应当到享受的时候了”；认为“对党有贡献，享受一点不算什么”；认为“这仅仅是生活上的小问题，不算一回事”。这种错误的认识，最足以腐蚀党和干部，最足以麻痹和松懈斗志；如不及时克服，让其自流滋长，将给党和革命极大损害。克服这种思想，是今天巩固党，巩固部队，巩固人民民主政权，进一步提高干部，贯彻整编节约运动的先决条件。因此在党内和在机关部队内部开展批评与自我批评，首长以身作则，加上广大党员和群众的民主监督，是完全必要的。社论号召：节约运动应首先从我们共产党、人民政府、人民解放军做起，我们自己先做好，然后拿这个模范行为去影响和推动全体人民，大家节衣缩食，改变社会风气，形成克服困难、支援前线、推动国家建设的巨大力量。
