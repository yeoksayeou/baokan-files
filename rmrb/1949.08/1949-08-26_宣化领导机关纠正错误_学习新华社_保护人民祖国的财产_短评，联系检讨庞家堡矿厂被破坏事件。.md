　　【Xuanhua News】Since the People's Daily published the news "Important Equipment of Pangjiabao Mine Suffers Damage," it has aroused the attention of the leading organs here to the protection of state property. Under the guidance of the County Party Committee, all districts have studied Xinhua News Agency's short commentary "Protecting the People's Motherland's Property" and conducted reviews in connection with the documents. Now, villages along the highways and near the mines have established road protection and mine protection committees. Under the promotion and inspection of county and district cadres, in less than a month, the masses in the three districts of Dingfangshui, Huashaoying, and Qianjiashawa have contributed 25 picks, as well as 923 parts from drilling rigs, paper machines, electromagnetic platforms, and printing presses. In addition, there were 200 catties of lubricating oil and over 1,000 catties of miscellaneous parts, and over 10,000 catties of iron. Some of these materials were deposited by our army when it withdrew in 1946, and some were taken by the masses in preparation for destruction and sale because the mine was not managed. At present, the districts and villages where the Pangjiabao Mine and factories are located are still registering and collecting materials.

　　宣化领导机关纠正错误
    学习新华社“保护人民祖国的财产”短评，联系检讨庞家堡矿厂被破坏事件。
    【宣化讯】自人民日报发表“庞家堡矿场重要设备遭受破坏”的消息后，已引起此间领导机关对保护国家财产的注意，在县委指导下，各区都学习了新华社“保护人民祖国的财产”的短评，并联系文件进行了检讨。现在沿公路、矿山附近的村庄，都成立了护路、护矿委员会。在县区干部推动和检查下，不到一月工夫，定方水、化梢营、钱家沙洼三个区的群众已献出了洋镐二十五把，及打眼床、造纸机、电磁台、印报机上的零件九百二十三件，另有擦机油二百斤，零星器件一千余斤，铁万余斤。这些器材，有的是一九四六年我军撤退时寄存的，有的是因矿山没人管理，被群众拿去准备毁坏卖掉的。目前庞家堡矿场及工厂所在地各区村，还正在登记搜集。
