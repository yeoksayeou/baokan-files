    The Transformation of Old Police in Beiping

    (III) Bravely Unburden, Resolutely Start Anew

    During the grievance sessions, each sub-bureau also linked the old police to the fact that, although they had many hardships themselves, they were direct accomplices of the ruling class in oppressing the people. As the grievance sessions were about to end, introspection was further proposed to eliminate the reactionary thoughts and work styles of the old police, making them further realize that reactionary police were criminals against the people. Only by completely bowing to the people and transforming themselves into people's police could they find the path they should take.

    As introspection began, some people developed new ideological concerns: they were afraid that if they revealed the bad things they had done in the past, they would be fired and discarded. They were unwilling to boldly expose themselves, only talking about unimportant matters that didn't hurt, or only talking about principles without facts, only talking about the distant past without mentioning the recent past, only talking about the past without mentioning the present. The leadership conducted in-depth mobilization, explaining the purpose of introspection, dispelling their concerns, and at the same time, activists took the lead in demonstrating. The introspection movement gradually shifted from unwillingness to expose to daring to expose, from shallow to deep, from individual self-criticism to mutual exposure. Each group mainly relied on self-struggle, combined with mass criticism and leadership enlightenment. After this hurdle was overcome, the awareness of the police officers improved another step. They felt that if they did not introspect, their "conscience" would be condemned, so they poured out things they had never been able to tell anyone before. Some people, recalling their shameless acts of extorting money from the people by taking advantage of their power, either openly or secretly, wept bitterly, hating themselves for being running dogs of the ruling class. Only by changing their ways and starting anew could they find a way out. After this path was identified, they bravely threw off their "burdens," reflecting on their past anti-communist and anti-people activities, such as acting as spies, harming the people secretly, swindling, abducting, deceiving, and beating the people. Some police officers said: Looking ahead, there is boundless light; looking at myself, I deserve to die. There is nothing else, only starting anew. Some demanded to immediately apologize to those who had been wronged by them. And they universally demanded to learn and further transform themselves into people's police.

    (IV) Transform, Progress, Move Towards Becoming People's Police!

    Apologizing and helping the masses with labor were conscious and voluntary demands made by the police officers after their awareness was universally raised following the grievance and introspection movements. The leadership consciously took charge of this work, organized groups, and personally went to the homes of rickshaw pullers, small vendors, and those who had been swindled to express their mistakes and ask for instruction and forgiveness. Many people paid off the "black debts" of money they had cheated out of others on the spot. In May, each sub-bureau dispatched nearly one-third of its personnel to help the masses dig ditches, dig air-raid shelters, carry water, carry garbage, and repair houses. The Fifth Brigade dispatched more than 500 people, and more than 100 people developed blisters on their hands from labor. The masses reacted very well, deeply feeling that in the past, they only knew that the police were in charge of the common people. Without the education of the Communist Party, they would never have dreamed that the police would work for the common people. As the training course was about to end, each sub-bureau held a get-together with the masses. The police officers universally reflected: When will the masses treat us as they treat the People's Liberation Army? Then our progress will be considerable.

    The evil habits of the old police of swindling, cheating, and beating the people have basically disappeared among the transformed and progressing police officers. They invariably buy tickets when watching operas or taking buses. Because they have begun to establish a new outlook on life of serving the people, the old mercenary viewpoints are gradually being overcome. Therefore, the perfunctory and careless attitude has also been replaced by a positive and responsible work style, which is evident in checking household registrations, public security, traffic, and learning. In general, traffic police work for long hours, but they all adhere to the two-hour daily study system. Each sub-bureau has planned and organized study, divided into several study groups according to different levels of education, conducting political, current affairs, cultural, and professional studies. After ideological transformation, they are moving towards becoming people's police.

    平市改造旧警察经过
    军光
    （续完）
    （三）勇敢放包袱，决心重作人
    诉苦中各分局同时也使旧警联系到：虽然自己有很多苦，但自己却做了统治阶级压迫人民的直接帮凶。当诉苦将要结束时，就进一步提出反省，清除旧警察的反动思想与作风，使其进一步的认识到反动警察是人民的罪人，只有彻底向人民低头，改造自己成为人民的警察，才是自己应走的道路。
    反省开始，有些人又产生了一种新的思想顾虑：恐怕说出过去做的坏事，而被开除不要了。不愿大胆暴露自己，仅说些不关痛痒的不重要的事，或者只说原则不说事实，只说远的不说近的，只说过去不说现在。领导上即深入的进行启发动员，阐明反省的目的是什么，解除其顾虑，同时积极分子带头，进行示范，反省运动就逐渐的由不愿暴露到敢于揭发，由浅到深入，由各人自我批评到互相揭发暴露。各组中主要依靠自我斗争，结合群众的批评和领导的启发。当这一关突破后，警士们的觉悟又提高了一步，感觉自己不反省，“良心”受责备，于是便把历来不能告人的事倾倒出来。有些人在回忆起自己仗势以公开或秘密的手段向人民诈财的无耻行为时，痛哭流涕，痛恨自己不该充当统治阶级的走狗，只有自己改头换面，重新作人，才是唯一的出路。这一道路认定后，勇敢的往下扔“包袱”，反省出自己曾作过的反共反人民的勾当，例如：当特务，暗害人民、坑、拐、骗及打骂人民等行为。有的警察说：往前看光明无比，看自己罪该万死，没别的，只有重新作人就是了。有的则要求立即向受过自己气的人去道歉。并普遍的要求学习，进一步改造自己成为人民的警察。
    （四）改造，进步，往人民警察方向迈进！
    道歉、帮助群众劳动，这是在诉苦与反省运动后，警士们的觉悟普遍提高的情况下，自觉自愿的一种要求，领导上则有意识的掌握了这一工作，有组织的分为小组，亲自到曾经挨过打的三轮车夫家，小摊贩家，受过坑骗的人家去，表示自己的错误，并请求给以训教和原谅。很多人将欺骗过钱的“黑帐”，当场还清。五月间各分局曾先后出动将近三分之一的人，帮助群众挖水沟、挖防空沟、担水、抬垃圾、修理房屋等。五大队出动了五百余人，有百余人因劳动而手上磨了泡。群众反应甚好，深深感到：过去只知道警察是管老百姓的，若没有共产党的教育，做梦也想不到警察会给老百姓干活。轮训班临结束时，各分局均已召开了与群众的联欢会。警士们普遍反映：什么时候群众把我们当成解放军看待，我们的进步就可观了。
    旧警察对待人民坑骗打骂的恶作风，在改造进步着的警察中，基本上已经不复存在了。看戏、坐车毫不例外的要买票。由于开始树立了为人民服务的新人生观，旧的雇佣观点逐渐的克服着，因此吊儿浪当马马虎虎的应付态度也随之由积极负责的工作作风所代替，查对户口、治安、交通、学习等工作，是一个显明的证明。一般的交通警，工作时间都很长，但都坚持了每日两小时的学习制。各分局均有计划的组织了学习，根据文化程度的不同，分成若干学习组，进行着政治的、时事的、文化的、业务的学习。他们经过思想改造后，正在往人民警察方向迈进中。
