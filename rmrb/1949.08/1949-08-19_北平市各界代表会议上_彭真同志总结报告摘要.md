(Beiping News) The following is a summary of the report given by Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at the Beiping Municipal People's Representative Conference:

Comrades Representatives:

Our People's Representative Conference has now successfully completed its mission.

Everyone has conducted a serious review of past work and believes that the government has been too lenient in dealing with leading and persistently malicious counter-revolutionaries, too "polite" in dealing with profiteers who disrupt financial prices and harm people's livelihoods, and that streamlining work has not been done well enough. These opinions are all correct.

At the same time, everyone is satisfied with Beiping's work in the past six months, believing that great achievements have been made and that the old Beiping has begun to transform into the people's new Beiping. Where do these achievements come from? They are due to the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, the heroic struggle of the People's Liberation Army, and the joint efforts of all the staff in Beiping and the two million people. We should thank them.

This conference has been very successful. The representatives debated a lot, but were as close as family. In accordance with the new democratic form that facilitates consultation with people from all walks of life, especially the working people, and in the spirit of Chairman Mao's "Serving the people wholeheartedly," "Saying all you know and saying it without reserve," and "Adhering to the truth and correcting mistakes," we have realistically discussed and resolved the problems. There is no constraint of the hypocritical old democratic forms, nor the perfunctory and perfunctory nature of the hypocritical bourgeois meetings. It demonstrated the sincere consultation and strong democratic unity between the representatives of all circles and the government. After careful study by the representatives and enthusiastic discussions at the conference, the opinions of the representatives have now been successfully gathered and a clear resolution has been made. This is a good foundation for the unity of the two million people in Beiping and a new direction for their efforts. We must unite and realize it one by one.

Now, on behalf of the Presidium, I will summarize some important issues. If everyone agrees, it will be used as a summary of the conference's discussions.

Unite the Four Friends to Continue Eliminating the Remaining Bandits and Secret Agents

(1) Now, the four friends of workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie in Beiping are united. In the past, some people wanted to liquidate industry and commerce and regard national capitalists as enemies. This was wrong, and now such opinions are no longer heard. Our four friends must unite closely on a democratic basis.

We are still in a period of military control, but military control is only a form of the people's democratic dictatorship. Its purpose is to suppress the activities of counter-revolutionaries and protect the democratic rights of the people, not to restrict the democratic rights of the people. May I ask if the people of all circles in Beiping and the representatives present here have felt any inconvenience caused by military control in the past six months? Absolutely not. As far as we know, only imperialists, feudalists, bureaucratic capitalists, and Kuomintang secret agents and bandits are dissatisfied with and afraid of military control. Dictatorship and control must be exercised over them, and we cannot be "polite." In the future, we must continue to eliminate the remaining counter-revolutionaries and lurking enemies, and deal with them appropriately according to the policy of combining leniency and suppression. Those who were coerced should not be investigated; those who are willing to repent and rehabilitate should be treated with leniency; and those who are the ringleaders and continue to do evil must be severely suppressed. In addition, profiteers who speculate and disrupt financial prices must be severely banned on the economic front. Only in this way can we smoothly carry out the construction of the new Beiping and effectively support the national liberation war.

Within the four friends of the people's democratic revolution, there is no coercion, but democracy and freedom. However, the three enemies should never be allowed any freedom. If they are given freedom, it will restrict the freedom of the people and undermine and harm the freedom of the people. We must resolutely, thoroughly, and cleanly deprive all counter-revolutionaries of their freedom. This is the people's democratic dictatorship. Let those secret agents and counter-revolutionaries scold us for being "undemocratic" and "unfree." The democracy and freedom of the people are not given to this gang of bandits!

Restore and Develop Production in Beiping and Complete Land Reform in the Suburbs

(2) Restoring and developing production is the basic task of Beiping's construction. In the past six months, some industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood have been restored, some have developed; some industries that are not beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood have declined, and some have gone bankrupt. We think this is very good. The people are the best judges. Anything that the people do not need should collapse, be eliminated, and quickly change its business.

At present, the serious problems that still exist in Beiping's public and private industries are: a considerable part of industrial products have poor quality, high costs, no production plan, and the product specifications do not meet the needs of the market. These problems must be solved, otherwise they will collapse and a crisis will occur. The solutions: First, improve the quality, make the finished products beautiful and practical. Second, reduce costs, only good quality and low price can maintain sales. Third, produce according to the specifications and styles required by the market. Fourth, production should be planned according to the development of the national economy and the quantity required by the market, and should not be blindly produced. Fifth, when opening factories, we must gradually get rid of the dependence on imperialist raw materials. Production should be based on our own raw materials and our own markets (it is better to strive for foreign markets).

In order to smoothly develop production, state-owned enterprises should strengthen a certain degree of production planning, implement democratic management (some have already done it, some have not done it well), and pay attention to the welfare of workers and adjust unreasonable wages.

Private enterprises should adjust labor-capital relations and continue to systematically sign collective contracts.

In the past, it was the capitalists who were sorry for the workers, not the workers who were sorry for the capitalists. After liberation, the workers stood up. In some factories, the workers had some left-leaning deviations in breaking the old feudal oppression and improving their living standards, and they did something beyond the scope. The capitalists were panicked because of this, thinking it was terrible. In fact, this is the inevitable reaction of the workers to the oppression of the capitalists in the past. Now, we must seek development on the basis of mutual benefit for labor and capital. The labor and capital sides of the Chinese medicine industry have signed a collective contract, and the labor and capital sides of the flour industry, knitting industry, and construction industry are also negotiating, and they can be resolved one after another soon.

Handicrafts and household side businesses should be gradually organized into supply and marketing or production cooperatives.

The government should not only provide guidance on the direction of production for public and private enterprises and handicraft production, but also provide possible guidance on production technology and the specifications of production products to improve the quality of production products.

In order to restore and develop production, the following problems must also be solved.

1. Sales channels. There must first be good quality and low-priced goods, and then public and private efforts must be combined to open up sales channels. Beiping has held an industrial product exhibition, organized a rural and urban trade guidance office, and public and private joint investigation teams have gone to various places to investigate market needs. Trading companies have signed contracts with various places to exchange products and raw materials. But these are not enough, and we must further use state-owned enterprises as the backbone, widely unite with upright merchants, and continue to work together to develop rural and urban and domestic and foreign trade. The market in Beiping, except for special handicrafts, is not abroad, but in the nearby rural areas.

2. Funds. The industrial and commercial circles must first resolutely put an end to capital speculation. Under the New Democratic economic policy, speculators will definitely go bankrupt. Only investing in production is the correct way to gain both fame and fortune, and you can not only participate in the glory of developing production, but also guarantee to obtain legitimate profits. Several private enterprises such as the Fuxing Flour Company have achieved great results in this regard.

3. Taxation. Although the burden on the citizens of Beiping is not very light, our government takes from the people and uses it entirely for the people. Since the war must continue now, and it has been decided that many things must be done, the only way to reduce the burden on the people is to quickly and thoroughly eliminate the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, liberate all of China, and strive to develop production. When the war is over and production is developed, the burden on the people can be reduced. The current method can only pay more attention to the fairness and rationality of taxation, and pay attention to conforming to the principle of supporting production in taxation, tax exemption, and tax rates.

(3) Suburban land issue. The Military Control Commission has promulgated a decision on the issue of suburban land. There were few proposals on this issue and little discussion at this meeting. We hope that the suburban work committee will lead the suburban farmers to quickly complete the land reform, eliminate feudalism, so as to liberate the farmers in the suburbs and develop agricultural production in the suburbs.

Improve and Popularize Cultural Education, Practice Economy, and Disperse the Population

(4) Education issues.

1. Improve the quality of teachers. Now, except for a few unqualified teachers and staff, the vast majority of teachers are conscientious and responsible, but they still need to improve their theoretical and political level and cultural level, and further reform teaching content and teaching methods in order to be able to successfully undertake the sacred task of educating the next generation.

2. Carry out adult literacy education, which should be valued as much as school education. Now the representatives of the Middle and Primary School Teachers' Union and the Student Union have announced to the conference that they are willing to take on this arduous task, which is a great guarantee.

3. Education for workers' children. Although the Education Bureau has paid considerable attention to this and made achievements in the past six months, it is not enough to add classes in various schools to accommodate workers' children. About four-fifths of workers' children are still out of school. This phenomenon is not allowed to continue, and a solution should be found.

4. We should encourage and support private schools that implement the government's education policy and are well-run. This is only beneficial and not harmful to the people. Regarding the tuition fees of private schools, the school authorities and student representatives should negotiate together in accordance with the resolution of the conference. If there are disputes, the Education Bureau will lead the resolution.

(5) We must practice economy and frugality. Streamline institutions and personnel, improve work efficiency, and strive to do more for the people with less expense.

(6) Disperse the population. Since the liberation of this city, nearly 200,000 unemployed people have dispersed into the surrounding villages, but the number of unemployed people is still quite large, and we should continue to disperse them to the countryside in a planned way. First of all, we must mobilize landlords to return to their hometowns. As long as the landlords do not cause trouble after returning to their hometowns, they should not be investigated for their past actions. Other unemployed people should also go to the countryside to participate in production. In addition, we should mobilize unemployed intellectuals to go to the countryside to serve and develop the people's culture and education in the countryside. This is the help that Beiping, a cultural city, should give to the countryside.

Establish a Regular Consultation Organization to Act in Concert to Build a New Beiping

(7) The organization of this People's Representative Conference should be fixed, and a regular consultation organization should be established. The main points of its organizational regulations have been initially drafted and will be submitted to the Military Control Commission for review and promulgation after the conference. If this form of meeting continues, representatives from all walks of life will have the opportunity to regularly consult on municipal affairs, be responsible for reporting to the masses in their respective units, and listen to their opinions and reflect them to the Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government in a timely manner. In this way, the government and the masses are closely linked, and representatives from all walks of life can participate in municipal affairs. Then, after a period of work, the mayor of Beiping and the committee of the Municipal People's Government can also be elected, and the Municipal People's Congress can also be convened.

Finally, I hope that representatives from all walks of life and the people of the city will assist the People's Government to immediately act in concert after the closing of the conference to implement the resolutions of the conference, and jointly overcome the difficulties in progress, victory, development, and transition. Under the banner of Chairman Mao, we will build a new Beiping, develop production, support the front, completely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, and win the final victory.

　　北平市各界代表会议上
  　彭真同志总结报告摘要
    【平市讯】中共北平市委书记彭真同志在北平市各界代表会议上的总结报告摘要如下：各位代表：
    现在我们的各界代表会议，已经顺利地完成了自己的任务。
    大家对于过去的工作，作了认真的检讨，认为政府对于首要和继续为恶的反革命分子的处置太宽大了，对于投机居奇、扰乱金融物价、危害人民生计的奸商的处理太“客气”了，而精简工作则做的还很不够，这些意见都很对。
    同时，大家对于北平半年来的工作，都认为满意，认为有很大成绩，已使旧的北平开始变成人民的新北平。这种成绩是那里来的呢？是由于中国共产党毛主席的领导，是由于人民解放军的英勇奋斗，由于北平市全体工作人员和二百万人民的共同努力。我们应该感谢他们。
    这次会议开得很好，代表们争论很多，却又亲如家人。我们按照便利于各界人民，特别是劳动人民协商办事的新的民主形式，本着毛主席“一切为人民服务”“知无不言、言无不尽”“坚持真理，修正错误”的精神，实事求是地商讨解决了问题，没有虚伪的旧民主形式的束缚，也没有虚伪的资产阶级会议中的应付和敷衍。它表现了各界代表与政府的真诚协商和坚强的民主团结。经过了代表们的认真研究和大会热烈讨论之后，现在，已把各界代表们的意见，圆满地集中了起来，作出了明确的决议，这是北平市二百万人民今后团结的好基础和努力的新方向。我们要团结起来，一一的把它实现。
    下面我代表主席团，再把一些重要的问题，概括地讲讲，如果大家同意，即作为大会的讨论总结。
    四个朋友团结起来继续肃清残余匪特
    （一）现在我们北平的工人、农民、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级这四个朋友是团结的，过去曾有人想清算工商业，把民族资本家当成敌人，这是不对的，现在已听不到这种意见了。我们四个朋友必须在民主基础上亲密地团结起来。
    目前我们还处在军事管制时期，但是军管制只是人民实行民主专政的一种形式，它的目的正是为了镇压反革命分子的活动，保护人民的民主权利，并不是限制人民的民主权利。请问半年来我们北平各界人民和在座的代表们曾感觉军管制对大家有什么不便么？决没有。据我们所知，不满和惧怕军管制的，只是帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义分子和国民党特务匪徒。对于他们是必须实行专政和管制的，不能“客气”。今后，我们必须继续肃清残余的反革命分子与潜伏的敌人，并根据宽大与镇压相结合的政策，恰当地予以处理。对于胁从分子应该不究；对于愿意改过自新的分子，应该宽大；对于首恶和继续为恶的分子，必须严予镇压。此外，在经济战线上对于投机居奇、扰乱金融物价的奸商，必须严予取缔。这样才能顺利地进行新北平的建设，并且有力地支援全国的解放战争。
    在人民民主革命的四个朋友内部，是没有强制的，是民主的、自由的。但对于三个敌人则决不应容许他们有任何的自由，如果给了他们自由，就是限制人民的自由，破坏和危害人民的自由。我们必须坚决彻底干净地剥夺一切反革命分子的自由。这就是人民民主专政。让那些特务反革命分子们骂我们“不民主”“不自由”罢，人民的民主和自由，本来就不是给予他们这伙匪徒的！
    恢复发展平市生产完成近郊土地改革
    （二）恢复发展生产，是北平建设事业中的基本任务。半年来对国民生计有益的行业有的恢复了，有的发展了；对国民生计无益的行业，有的下降了，有的破产了。我们认为这样很好。人民是最好的审判者，凡人民所不需要的应该垮，应该被淘汰，应该赶快转业。
    目前北平公私营工业中还存在着的严重问题是：有相当一部分工业产品质量不好、成本过高，生产无计划，产品规格不合乎市场的需要，这些问题必须解决，不然就会垮台，就会发生危机。克服的办法：第一，要提高质量，使成品美观适用。第二，减低成本，只有物美价廉，才能保持销路。第三，按照市场需要的规格、样式来生产。第四，要有计划的按照国民经济发展和市场需要的数量来生产，不要盲目地生产。第五，开办工厂，要逐渐摆脱对帝国主义原料的依赖性，生产要就自己之原料，就自己之市场（能争取国外市场更好）。
    为了顺利的发展生产，公营企业应加强一定的生产计划性，应实行民主管理（有的已经做了，有的做得还很不好），并注意工人的福利，调整不合理的工资。
    私营企业，应调整劳资关系，继续有系统地订立集体合同。
    过去是资本家对不起工人，而不是工人对不起资本家；解放后，工人起来了，有些工厂的工人在打破旧的封建压迫和改善生活待遇中曾发生过左的偏向，做的出了些范围，资方曾因此发生恐慌，以为了不得，其实这乃是工人对于过去资方的压迫必然的反应，现在要在劳资两利的基础上来求发展。国药业劳资双方已签订了集体合同，面粉业、针织业、建筑业等劳资双方也正在商订中，不久都可以相继解决。
    手工业和家庭副业要逐步地组织在供销或生产合作社中。
    政府对于公私企业和手工业生产不仅要在生产方向上给以指导，还必须在生产技术上和生产品的规格上给以可能的指导，以提高生产品的质量。
    为了恢复发展生产还必须解决下列一些问题。
    一、销路。必须先有物美价廉的商品，再加以公私合力去开辟。北平已经举行了工业品展览会，组织了城乡贸易指导处，并由公私合组调查小组到各地调查市场需要，贸易公司曾和各地订立合同，交流产品与原料。但这些都还不够，必须进一步以公营企业为骨干，广泛团结正派的商人，共同继续努力开展城乡和内外贸易。北平的市场，除了特种手工业以外，不是在国外，而是在附近的农村。
    二、资金。工商业界首先要坚决杜绝资本的投机活动。在新民主主义经济政策下，投机者必定破产，只有投资于生产才是名利双全的正确的出路，既有参加发展生产事业的光荣，又可保证获得正当的利润。工业界不应等待和依靠政府的贷款和投资，主要应是吸收游资到正当的工商业中来。复兴面粉公司等几个私营企业，在这方面已获得了很大成绩。
    三、税收。北平市民的负担虽然并不很轻，但我们的政府是取之于民，又完全用之于民的。既然现在战争还必须继续，并决定有许多事情要办，那么要减轻人民的负担，只有迅速彻底消灭国民党反动派的残余，解放全中国，并努力发展生产。战争结束了，生产发展了，人民的负担才能减轻。现在的办法只能更加注意税收的公平合理，在征税、免税及税率上注意符合扶植生产的原则。
    （三）郊区土地问题。军管会曾颁布关于郊区土地问题的决定，此次会议上对此问题提案少，讨论也少。望郊区工作委员会好好领导郊区农民迅速完成土地改革工作，消灭封建，以便解放近郊农民，发展近郊的农业生产。
    提高普及文化教育厉行节约疏散人口
    （四）教育问题。
    一、提高教师质量。现在除了少数不称职的教职员以外，绝大多数教师是认真负责的，但仍须提高理论政治水平和文化水平，并进一步改革教学内容和教学方法，才能胜任愉快地负担起教育后一代的神圣任务。
    二、开展成年文化补习教育，要和学校教育一样地重视，现在中小教职联和学联的代表，都向大会宣布他们愿负起这个艰巨的任务，这就有了一大保证了。
    三、工人子弟教育，教育局在半年来虽然已予以相当注意并作出成绩，但在各校增设班次，容纳工人子弟还不够，工人子弟仍有约五分之四失学，这种现象不允许继续存在下去，应设法解决。
    四、我们对于私立学校，凡是执行了政府的教育方针，办的好的，应予鼓励和扶持。这对于人民是只有好处没有坏处的。关于私立学校学费问题应按大会决议，由学校当局和学生代表共同协商，如有争执，由教育局领导解决。
    （五）要厉行精简节约。精简机构和人事，提高工作效率，力争用更少的花费为人民办更多的事情。
    （六）疏散人口。本市解放后已有近二十万失业人口散入四乡，但现有的失业人口数目还很不少，应即继续有计划地疏散下乡。首先要动员地主还乡，地主还乡后只要不再捣乱，应不究既往。其他无业人民亦应下乡参加生产。此外应动员失业知识分子下乡服务，发展乡村的人民文化教育事业，这是北平这个文化都市应该给予乡村的帮助。
    设立经常协议机关一致行动建设新北平
    （七）把这次各界代表会议的组织固定起来，并设立经常协议机关，其组织条例要点已初步拟成，会后将提交军管会审查公布。这种会议形式继续下去，各界代表就得到经常协商市政的机会，负责向各单位的群众报告，并听取他们的意见转向军管会及市政府及时反映。这样，既使政府与群众连系密切起来，又使各界代表得以与闻市政。然后，再经过一个工作时期，北平市的市长及市人民政府的委员会也可以实行选举了，市人民代表大会也可以召开了。
    最后希望各界代表与全市人民在大会闭幕后，协助人民政府立即一致行动起来，执行大会的决议，并共同克服进步中、胜利中、发展中、过渡中的困难，在毛主席的旗帜下，建设新北平，发展生产，支援前线，彻底消灭蒋介石，赢得最后胜利。
