　　Lin Niang has well described relying mainly on oneself in learning. In our class, the girls have a very bad habit. Whenever someone goes to the blackboard, they always whisper, "Please help me." This has become a habit. But you should know that doing this doesn't do any good. If you can't do your homework, you can't answer questions well either. Sometimes, when girls can't remember the answer to a question, they will remain silent for a while. At this time, someone will secretly tell them the answer, which of course prevents them from concentrating. When the teachers feel that the girls' answers are not good, they give them lower scores, but sometimes it's the opposite: when the teachers don't notice that someone is secretly helping, they give them good scores instead. How embarrassed you should be when you feel you've gotten a good score you didn't deserve!

　　Especially after believing that what they give is only harmful and not beneficial, I don't like whispering and talking secretly.

　　Once, when I was answering a physics question, I answered everything very well. Suddenly, I couldn't remember a certain law, which I could have recalled myself. At this moment, I suddenly heard someone secretly telling me. This sound disrupted my thinking, and I had to say, "I forgot!" Unfortunately, the girls prevented me from thinking. You should know that I knew that law.

　　I want to say to all the children: "Don't rely on whispering!"

    为什么我不喜欢在课堂上打无线电
    交头接耳的偷着说话
    孙受恩译
    琳娘很好地叙述了在学习中主要是依靠自己。在我们班里的姑娘们有一种很不好的恶习，有人只要一上黑板，一定这么低声地说：“请帮一下忙。”这样已经成了习惯了。但是，要知道这样做是什么好处也得不到的，假如你不会做功课，同样也不能很好地回答问题。有时姑娘们回答问题时，若记不起来了，就会沉默一会，就在这个时候，不知谁就会暗暗地教给他，这当然是妨碍她的思想集中。当教员们觉得姑娘回答不好，就给她把分数打低些，但有时就相反：教员没有发觉有别人在偷教时，反而给评了好分数。当你觉得自己得到不应得的好分数时，该是多么不好意思呀！
    特别是在自己相信他们所给与的只有害而无利之后，我是不喜欢交头接耳地偷说的。
    有一次我回答物理题时，一切答的都很好，忽然一时想不起一个什么定律了，本来我自己是可以想起的。这时突然听到有人暗暗地告诉我。这声音打乱了我的思考，我不得不说：“我忘记了！”遗憾得很，姑娘们妨碍了我去思考，要知道，那个定律我是知道的。
    我想向所有的孩子们说：“不要依靠交头接耳！”
