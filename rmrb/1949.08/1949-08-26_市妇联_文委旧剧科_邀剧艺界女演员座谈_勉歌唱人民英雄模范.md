The Municipal Women's Federation and Cultural Committee's Old Opera Section Invite Female Performers from the Theatrical Arts Circle for a Discussion, Encouraging Them to Sing Praises of People's Heroes and Models

[This Municipality News] The Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Democratic Women's Federation and the Municipal Cultural Committee's Old Opera Section invited female performers from the city's opera circles to a forum yesterday morning (25th) at the Democratic Theater. More than 70 people from Peking Opera, folk art, and Ping Opera circles attended, including Gao Yuqian, Yun Yanming, Xu Dongming, Song Huiling, and Guo Fengxia. At the meeting, Yang Yunyu of the Municipal Women's Federation introduced the work of the Women's Federation and called on everyone to unite, serve the people, sing praises of the people's heroes and models, and create model workers in the opera circle. In their speeches, everyone agreed that their status had improved after liberation, and the oppression and manipulation by Kuomintang soldiers, secret agents, and bureaucrats had been eliminated. They then raised the issue that most female actors currently have a low level of education or are illiterate, and cannot read new scripts or recite new lyrics, as well as the question of how to organize. They hoped that the Women's Federation and relevant parties would provide assistance. In her speech, Yun Yanming called on everyone to unite, improve their cultural level, and enhance their political awareness. Gao Yuqian also told everyone that in order to improve her political level, so that she could better engage in the old opera reform movement in the future, she had been admitted to the Revolutionary University and would study hard.
