  　Loans Effectively Support Handicraft Industry
    Resolving Difficulties for Small Producers in Funds, Raw Materials, and Sales Channels.
    [Tianjin News] The Cooperative Department of the Tianjin People's Bank, last month, used the method of providing loans in kind to support handicraft production in conjunction with the General Supply and Marketing Cooperative. Since July, the city's General Supply and Marketing Cooperative has organized fifteen production groups, targeting family industries with two or three looms each, totaling 409 looms and 423 workers and apprentices. If production starts, they can produce 2,775 bolts of white twill and 3,384 bolts of white cotton cloth per month. The produced white twill can also be exchanged for raw materials from the General Supply and Marketing Cooperative, with one bolt of white twill exchanged for 14 catties of 20-count yarn. Therefore, as long as each group has the first batch of raw materials to start production, they can circulate it later and accumulate some capital through surplus. However, these family industries have long been squeezed by commercial capital and usury, depleting their working capital and making them unable to purchase raw materials for production. To this end, the Cooperative Department purchased raw materials from companies such as the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and lent them to various production groups. From July 13th to the end of July, a total of 105 bundles and six strands of 20-count yarn were lent out, resolving the difficulty for small producers in purchasing raw materials. This loan in kind proves that only by comprehensively solving the three problems of funds, raw materials, and sales channels for small producers can they be liberated from the exploitation of commercial capital and usury, develop or restore production in a planned way, and create prerequisites for cooperative undertakings. Unified loan in kind can improve product quality, reduce the circulation of currency in the market (because the department purchases yarn using transfer accounts), and avoid stimulating prices.

　　津人民银行合作部
  　贷实扶助手工业
    解除了小生产者资金、原料、销路等困难。
    【天津讯】本市人民银行合作部，上月曾以贷实的办法，结合供销合作总社扶植手工业生产。本市合作供销总社自七月份起，以每家有二、三台织机的家庭工业为对象，组织了十五个生产小组，共有织机四○九台，工人及学徒四二三人。若开工生产，每月可产白斜纹布二七七五匹、白市布三三八四匹；所产的白斜纹布还可以向供销总社换取原料，计白斜纹布一匹换二十支纱十四斤。因此，各组只要有第一批原料开工生产，以后就可以周转过来，并可以借着盈余积累些资本。但这些家庭工业，早已在商业资本和高利贷的长期压榨下使周转资金枯竭，无力购买开工生产的原料。为此，合作部特在花纱布公司等处购进原料，贷给各生产小组。自七月十三日至七月底，共贷出二十支纱一百零五件六捆，解决了小生产者购买原料的困难。这次贷实证明，替小生产者统筹解决资金、原料、销路三方面的问题，才能做到使他们从商业资本和高利贷的榨压下解放出来，有计划的发展或恢复生产，进而为合作事业创造前提；统一贷实可以提高产品品质；减少通货在市场上的流通（因该部购纱系用转帐办法），避免刺激物价。
