    Avenging My Father
    ——An Interview with Fang Rongsong, Eldest Son of Martyr Fang Zhimin
    Zhao Ying, Feng Jian
    On the eve of "August 1st" [Army Day], reporters at the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government Guesthouse interviewed Fang Rongsong and his relatives, the eldest son of revolutionary leader Fang Zhimin, who was murdered in Nanchang in July 1935 by the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek. As if meeting family, they recounted in great detail everything about martyr Fang Zhimin.
    "The people of northeastern Jiangxi rarely don't know that my father built his world with two and a half guns," Fang Rongsong began his narration: In the late spring of 1927, after the failure of the Great Revolution, Comrade Fang Zhimin withdrew from Nanchang and returned to his hometown of Qigong Town, Yiyang, a place of white terror, under the Party's orders. He reorganized and restored the peasant associations and led the peasant struggle. At that time, there were only three guns, and one was broken, hence the name "two and a half." Comrades such as Shao Shiping (current Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government) and Fang Zichun (current Deputy Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government) also led this struggle. The peasant guerrillas they led started with these two and a half guns, fighting the enemy and gradually growing in strength, eventually establishing the Northeastern Jiangxi Soviet Government and the Red Army Tenth Army Corps.
    In 1934, Comrade Fang Zhimin led the Anti-Japanese Vanguard Northward. On the way, they encountered a "encirclement and suppression" by Kuomintang bandit troops with more than seven times their strength. On January 24, 1935, during a breakout from Huaiyu Mountain, he was unfortunately captured by the bandit troops.
    Fang Rongsong was filled with grief and indignation as he spoke here, pausing for a moment before continuing: "In prison, the bandits exhausted all means of threats, enticements, tortures, and beatings against my father, but my father did not yield in the slightest. On February 6, 1935, the bandits held a so-called 'Celebration of the Live Capture of Bandit Fang' in Nanchang, slandering my father and demanding that he come on stage to meet the masses. My father did not show any fear or hesitation at the time, and said on stage with impassioned spirit: 'I regret that I have not done more for the people to continue and complete the revolutionary cause. My personal life and death are insignificant. Even if I die, there are still all our revolutionary comrades and the broad masses of people to fight against the reactionaries. The Chinese Communist Party will surely succeed, and the Chinese revolution will surely triumph!' Many people in the audience were moved to tears. My father was still shouting 'Long live the Chinese Communist Party!' when he was dying." Fang Rongsong stopped talking, his eyes filled with tears.
    After Comrade Fang Zhimin's glorious sacrifice, the Kuomintang bandits began to cruelly persecute his family. Over the years, the Kuomintang bandit troops specially stationed in Yiyang to monitor the Fang Zhimin family in Qigong Town burned their house thirteen times. The old and young, without exception, suffered their tortures, intimidation, and imprisonment more than once. Whenever there was any disturbance in the Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi border guerrilla armed forces, the bandits would first place his family under house arrest, intimidate and torture them to extract information about the guerrillas, or conduct fierce searches and inspections, then set a fire that turned the sky red. Fang Rongsong said: "For fifteen long years, my grandmother, mother, younger siblings, and I squeezed into a small thatched hut, relying entirely on my daily mountain wood-gathering to make a living."
    "Speaking of these fifteen years of hellish life, I am truly filled with indignation." Rongsong took a deep breath and said resolutely: "Now that our own troops are back, this time I will settle this blood debt with the Kuomintang bandits. I want to return to Yiyang to organize the peasants and help the troops fight to Guangdong and Taiwan, to avenge my father, to avenge all the people of Jiangxi and all of China!"

    为爸爸复仇
    ——方志敏先烈长子方荣松访问记
    赵楹  冯健
    “八一”前夕，记者在江西省人民政府招待所里，访问了一九三五年七月间被匪首蒋介石，在南昌所杀害的革命领袖方志敏同志的长子方荣松及其亲属。他们象见了亲人一样，向我们滔滔不绝的叙述着有关方志敏先烈的一切事迹。
    “赣东北的人民，很少不知道我爸爸是靠两支半枪打天下的”，方荣松这样开始他的叙述：一九二七年春末，大革命失败后，方志敏同志退出南昌，奉党的命令回到白色恐怖的故乡弋阳漆工镇，整顿恢复农民协会，领导农民斗争，那时只有三支枪一支是坏的，故皆称两支半，当时领导这个斗争的尚有邵式平（现江西省政府主席）、方志纯（现江西人民省政府副主席）等同志，他们所领导的农民游击队，就是以这两支半枪起家，向敌人进行搏斗，逐渐壮大了自己，最后建立了赣东北省苏维埃政府和红军第十军团。
    一九三四年，方志敏同志带领着抗日先遣队北上，中途遭遇国民党匪军七倍以上兵力的“围剿”，一九三五年一月二十四日在怀玉山突围时，不幸被匪军所俘。
    方荣松说到这里时悲愤交加，停顿了一会，接着说：“在监狱里，匪徒们对爸爸施尽了威胁、利诱、酷刑、拷打，但爸爸丝毫没有屈服，匪徒们即于一九三五年二月六日，在南昌举行所谓‘庆祝生擒方匪大会’，诬蔑爸爸，要他上台和群众见面，爸爸当时并没有任何恐惧犹豫，并在台上激昂慷慨地说：‘我很遗憾：没有替人民作更多的事情，继续完成革命事业，我个人的生死是无所谓的，我死了还有我们全体革命同志，和广大人民向反动派进行斗争，中国共产党一定会成功，中国革命一定会胜利。’台下不少群众被感动得流下眼泪，爸爸临死时还在高呼，‘中国共产党万岁！’”方荣松收住了话头，眼里含着眼泪。
    方志敏同志光荣牺牲后，国民党匪帮们又开始对其家属施行残酷的迫害，这些年，漆工镇志敏同志家里，被专门派驻弋阳进行监视的国民党匪军，先后焚烧过十三次，老老少少，不止一次的遭受他们拷打、恫吓和监禁。每当闽浙赣边区游击武装风吹草动时，匪徒们便首先把其家属软禁起来，恫吓并拷打他们招出游击队的信息，或者凶狠地进行搜索检查，随即一把火烧得满天通红。方荣松说：“十五年漫长的岁月里，祖母、母亲及弟弟妹妹和我六人挤在小茅庵里，全靠我每天上山打柴糊口。”
    “提起这十五年来的地狱生活，我真是愤慨万分。”荣松长舒一口气，坚毅地说：“现在自己的队伍又回来了，这回我要向国民党匪徒们清算这笔血债，我要回到弋阳组织农民，帮助队伍打到广东、台湾，为爸爸复仇，为全江西全中国人民复仇！”
