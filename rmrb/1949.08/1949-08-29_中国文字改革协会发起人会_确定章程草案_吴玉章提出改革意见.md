[Ping City News] The inaugural meeting of the Chinese Language Reform Association held its third meeting yesterday afternoon (the 28th) at North China University. Attendees included Wu Yuzhang, Li Jinxi, Xu Teli, Xiao San, Luo Changpei, Ye Dingyi, as well as newly proposed initiators Hu Qiaomu and Nie Zhen. First, Wu Yuzhang explained the key points of this meeting, stating that Chinese language reform is a significant issue. Currently, we are researching and experimenting with methods for Chinese language reform, and we will need government assistance in the future to promote it widely. After enthusiastic discussion, the draft charter of the Chinese Language Reform Association was revised and finalized. The date for the general assembly was tentatively set after the New Political Consultative Conference. Regarding the already submitted list of members, it was decided to be reviewed individually by the initiators before finalization. Finally, Wu Yuzhang proposed that preparations should be made before the general assembly regarding the principles of future Chinese language reform, as well as research and experimentation methods. He also put forward his personal opinions: On the principles of Chinese language reform, we should strive for scientific, international, and popular appeal, transforming it into a phonetic script based on Latin Roman letters. Various regions and ethnic groups can use phonetic scripts based on their dialects and ethnic languages, but at the same time, the more common and widely used Northern dialect should be the standard, so that the national language has a unified direction for development. The various simplified characters of Chinese characters should be compiled for use in popular reading materials for the time being. In terms of the methods of Chinese language reform, constant research work should be carried out, and pilot projects should be conducted in selected areas across the country.

[Another Dispatch] Concurrently with the third inaugural meeting of the Chinese Language Reform Association, Wu Yuzhang, one of the initiators, displayed on his desk over a hundred letters, books, and various opinions and proposals for reforming Chinese characters, sent to him by people across the country who are concerned about the reform of Chinese language and writing. The books included the earliest Latinized New Writing works of Qu Qiubai, the founder of Northern Dialect Latinized New Writing, "Chinese Latinized Alphabet" (a reader in New Writing, Chinese characters, and Russian, published in Moscow in 1930), as well as various Latinized New Writing readers, textbooks, and dictionaries compiled by Wu Yuzhang, Lin Boqu, Zeng Yongquan, Xiao San, Liu Min, Lin Shan, Shi Pinqing, Wang Xiangbao, Mai Ying and others in Vladivostok, Soviet Union (all published by the Far Eastern National Joint Publishing House in Boli, Soviet Union). These are the most valuable documents in the history of the Chinese Latinized New Writing movement. In addition, there are various books and readings related to Chinese language reform and various proposals. From these, one can see the historical process of the Chinese language reform movement.

　　中国文字改革协会发起人会
  　确定章程草案
    吴玉章提出改革意见
    【平市讯】中国文字改革协会发起人会昨（二十八）日下午在华北大学举行第三次会议，出席吴玉章、黎锦熙、徐特立、萧三、罗常培、叶丁易，以及新提出的发起人胡乔木、聂真等。首由吴玉章说明此次开会要点。并说明中国文字改革是一个很大的问题，现在我们是作研究和试验中国文字改革的方法，今后还需政府帮助，才能广泛推行。旋经热烈讨论，重新修改确定了中国文字改革协会的章程草案。大会的召开日期，原则上确定在新政协会议以后举行。关于已经提出的会员名单，决定经发起人会个别审查后再予确定。最后，经吴玉章提出：关于将来中国文字改革的原则，以及研究和试验的方法，应在大会以前作一准备。他并提出个人意见：在中国文字改革的原则上，应力求科学化，国际化，大众化，改成以拉丁罗马字母为主体的拼音文字，各地方各民族可根据其方言与民族语言应用拼音文字，但同时要以较普遍的、通行得最广的北方话作为标准，使全国语言有一个统一发展的方向；并整理汉字的各种简体字，作为目前通俗读本之用。在中国文字改革的方法上要作经常的研究工作，并在全国各地选择一定地区试行。
    【又讯】在中国文字改革协会第三次发起人会议同时，该会发起人之一吴玉章将全国各地关心中国语文改革问题的人士寄给他的信件、书籍，以及各种改革中国文字的意见与方案等共百余件陈列案头。书籍包括北方话拉丁化新文字创始人瞿秋白的最初的拉丁化新文字著作“中国拉丁化的字母”（是一本新文字、汉字、俄文对照的读物，一九三○年莫斯科出版），以及吴玉章、林伯渠、曾涌泉、萧三、刘敏、林山、石品青、王湘宝、麦英等人在苏联海参崴编著的各种拉丁化新文字读本、读物、教科书、辞典等（都是苏联伯力远东国家联合出版部出版的），这些都是中国拉丁化新文字运动史上的最珍贵的文献。此外，还有各种有关中国语文改革的书籍及各种方案的读物。从中可以看出中国文字改革运动的历史进程。
