    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd. The Huai'an County government's restriction on wheat exports violates the principle of domestic material circulation, and has been criticized by the Subei Administrative Office. The county government recently cited the poor wheat harvest this year as an excuse to obstruct the Yangzhou flour mill and rice mill from sending people to the county to purchase wheat. Only a small portion of purchases was allowed, and even merchants were not allowed to transport the wheat they had already purchased. After learning of this, the Subei Administrative Office telegraphed its subordinate governments, criticizing Huai'an's restriction on wheat exports as a violation of the principle of domestic material circulation. The directive emphasized that at present, the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas must be carried out normally within the liberated areas. In addition to strictly stopping illegal activities of speculative merchants, no restrictions or constraints should be imposed on general merchants who are engaged in legitimate procurement, transportation and sales. In addition to ordering the Huai'an County government to promptly correct this, the directive also requires governments at all levels to conduct inspections in this regard immediately.

    违反物资交流原则
    淮安限制小麦出境
    苏北行署已提出批评
    【新华社上海三日电】淮安县政府限制小麦出境，违反内地物资流通的原则，已经苏北行署提出批评。该县政府近以今年小麦收成不好为辞，阻挠扬州面粉厂及碾米厂派人至该县采购小麦，只准采购一小部分，甚至不准该商等将已经买好的小麦运出。苏北行署获悉后，特于日前电示所属各级政府，指责淮安限制小麦出境是违背内地物资流通的原则。该指示着重指出：目前解放区内必须正常开展城乡物资交流，除对投机商人非法活动应予严格制止外，对一般正当采购运销的商人，不应加以任何限制与约束。该指示除饬令淮安县政府迅予纠正外，并要求各级政府应即对此进行检查。
