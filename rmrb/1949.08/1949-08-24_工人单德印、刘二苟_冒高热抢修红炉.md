Workers Shan Deyin and Liu Ergou
　　Bravely Repair Red-Hot Furnace Despite High Heat
　　[Taiyuan Dispatch] Shan Deyin and Liu Ergou, heating furnace workers at the Northwest Steel Plant in Taiyuan, displayed heroic spirit by fearlessly entering a red-hot furnace to repair its roof, completing the repair task. The roof of the heating furnace at the steel plant had collapsed in one section, but the production tasks were extremely urgent, making the roof repair of utmost importance. Waiting for the furnace temperature to cool down from 1200 degrees would take two or three days. However, the plant workers poured cold water into the heating furnace after it had been shut down for sixteen hours. Thereupon, workers Shan Deyin and Liu Ergou, covered themselves with water-soaked burlap sacks and went inside. However, the heat reduction was limited, and it was still impossible for the workers to repair the furnace. In less than five minutes, the burlap sacks dried out, and breathing inside the furnace became extremely difficult. Under these circumstances, they decided to take turns repairing the furnace, alternating every fifteen minutes. After coming out of the furnace, they would lie on the ground to breathe, their bodies roasted red, and the burlap sacks they wore had a burnt smell. Under such conditions, they finally repaired the red-hot furnace after three hours, ensuring the continued progress of production.

　　工人单德印、刘二苟
  　冒高热抢修红炉
    【太原电】太原西北炼钢厂加热炉工人单德英刘二苟，奋不顾身，躜进红炉，抢修炉顶，完成了修理任务，发挥了工人阶级的英雄主义。炼钢厂加热炉因炉顶塌了一块，但生产任务十分紧迫，炉顶抢修至为重要，如等待炉内温度从一千二百度到冷却，则需时要两三天，但该厂工人在加热炉停火十六小时后，复将冷水灌入，于是单德印、刘二苟两工人就披上水湿的麻袋进去，但热减低有限，工人仍不可能进入炉中修理，还不到五分钟，麻袋就被烤干了，并且在炉内呼吸异常困难。就在这样的情形下，他俩人决定替换抢修，两人每隔十五分钟替换一次，一出炉子就躺在地上呼吸，身上烤得发红，所披的麻袋都有了焦味。就在这样的条件下，经过三小时终于修好红炉，保证了生产的继续进行。
