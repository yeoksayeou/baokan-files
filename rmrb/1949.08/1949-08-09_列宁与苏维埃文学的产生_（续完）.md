Lenin distinguished between bourgeois intellectuals who served the wealthy and genuinely educated intellectuals who sincerely wished to serve the revolution.

Lenin wrote, "Educated people have come to the side of the people, to the side of the workers, and are helping to break the resistance of the slaves of capital.

The number of such people is increasing day by day." Among the representatives of pre-revolutionary bourgeois aristocratic literature were such titans of culture and education as the famous poets Alexander Blok and Valery Bryusov. It was no accident that Blok and Bryusov, as if to confirm Lenin's words quoted above, came to the revolutionary camp in the earliest days of the October Revolution, dedicating their talents to the revolution, despite the torrent of criticism from their former "friends." It was precisely the October Revolution that encouraged Blok to write his famous "The Twelve."

The training of Soviet experts in the fields of literature and art is perhaps the most difficult task. New writers can only emerge from the people, who are an inexhaustible source of talent. Lenin said that only under socialism can the working people "reveal their abilities, develop their talents, and demonstrate their genius, these abilities and geniuses being an inexhaustible source in the people, which capitalism crushes, ruins, and strangles by the thousands."

Discovering talents among the working people and training them to become experts in all fields of activity (including literature and art) is one of the foremost tasks. "Proletarian Culture" tried to interfere in this matter. As its name suggests, this organization once declared its purpose to be the careful study of proletarian culture. But it did not succeed, and could not succeed, because it based itself on erroneous philosophical and organizational premises, which could not but lead them to serious political errors, ultimately leading to failure.

The biggest mistake of "Proletarian Culture" was that it rejected the culture of the past, which was contrary to Lenin's policy of critically absorbing it.

The error of "Proletarian Culture" also lay in its attempt to "create" a new proletarian culture using laboratory methods.

According to the "theorists" of "Proletarian Culture," socialist culture was neither built in the process of building a new society, nor in the struggle against the influence of bourgeois ideology, but in special academic institutions and research rooms, greenhouses for cultivating new literature and art "producers" who were detached from life and struggle. This view denied the influence of the working masses on the establishment of socialist culture, this concept believes that: the "experts" dedicated the well-made "proletarian culture" to the working class, and the working class only waited to enjoy it.

"Proletarian Culture" concerning cultural undertakings, alienating itself from the Communist Party and the Soviet government, saying that it wanted to maintain its "independence" and "exclusive rights," this tendency was also fundamentally wrong.

Therefore, the Proletarian Culture Research Institute found that they were divorced from the masses and could not arouse any response around them. Poets and artists who came out of the working class also became detached from their own class in these research rooms, proving that they could not create any new culture. They were bewitched by bourgeois poetics and often slipped into petty-bourgeois licentiousness.

Lenin sarcastically ridiculed the naive and ridiculous methods of "Proletarian Culture" in attempting to "cultivate a proletarian culture." Lenin advocated massively raising the cultural level of all working people and promoting public education (including higher education). He believed that this was the path to training the people we needed to promote a new socialist culture.

After the civil war, the cultural revolution, which Lenin regarded as a necessary prerequisite for the success of socialist construction, was put on the agenda.

In proposing the idea of a cultural revolution, Lenin refuted a basic tenet of the opportunists of the Second International, who asserted that the proletarian revolution must first have a group of proletarian cultural and administrative cadres trained under capitalism, and only after having such trained cadres could the proletariat seize power. This dogma was also advocated by the Russian Mensheviks (including Bogdanov, the "leader" of "Proletarian Culture"). Lenin gave a devastating blow to this cowardly argument from the petty-bourgeois democrats.

"If it is said that the construction of socialism requires a considerable level of culture (although no one can say what this considerable 'cultural level' is), then why can't we first use revolutionary means to win the necessary prerequisites for creating this considerable level, and then move forward on the basis of the worker-peasant regime and the Soviet system, catching up with other nations?"

In proposing the idea of cultural revolution, Lenin also formulated the practical methods and means to implement the cultural revolution, that is, to train a cultural army on the basis of the Soviet system.

Lenin and Stalin formulated a series of plans to improve the cultural level of the working people in urban and rural areas and in various border nationalities.

These plans played a major role in the development of Soviet literature in later years. When culture was introduced to the masses, they began to cultivate the main force of Soviet writers from their own ranks. Therefore, with regard to literature, this is a long-term policy.

The Soviet government and the Communist Party naturally could not limit themselves to expectations for the future, that is, at that time, the people needed a literature that would help them defend the Soviet Republic and build socialism. In fact, such a literature existed from the beginning of the revolution.

The great poet Mayakovsky, in addition to larger works such as "150,000,000" and "Mystery-Bouffe," also wrote many poems full of revolutionary passion.

In those years, the poet spent a lot of time in his work writing many propaganda advertisements with poetic titles for the Russian Telegraph Agency "ROSTA."

The poems of Demyan Bedny reached their peak during the years of the civil war. Many of his poems became very popular reading among the Red Army soldiers at the front and the working people in the rear.

Shortly after the end of the civil war, Serafimovich's "Iron Flood," Furmanov's "Chapayev," Gladkov's "Cement," and other masterpieces of Soviet literature appeared. Particularly great was the role played by Gorky during this period and throughout his life. He was a great proletarian writer, the founder of socialist realism, and the mentor of not only the older generation of proletarian writers but also the entire Soviet writers.

In addition to the heavy tasks of organizational work in building a new culture, Gorky also wrote such masterpieces as "My Universities," "The Artamonov Business," and "The Life of Klim Samgin" during the period of Soviet construction.

In addition to these famous writers, there were many unknown young poets and prose writers who were full of revolutionary enthusiasm, and these writers later won fame in Soviet literature.

These writers enjoyed the constant support and care of the Soviet government. In the early years of the Soviet regime, although Lenin was busy all day directing the war and complex economic problems, he still paid great attention to issues related to culture, especially literature. At that time, Soviet writers had received extremely valuable instructions from Lenin, which guided them on the right path. At the end of 1920, just after the end of the war operations on the main fronts of the civil war, the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), on Lenin's proposal, adopted and published a special letter discussing the cultural and literary issues of "Proletarian Culture."

As always, the policies adopted by the Soviet government in the field of literature also remarkably expressed the spirit of fighting for the Party spirit of art, for the close combination between art and the Communist Party's policies, and for the close combination between art and the interests of the working class and the broadest masses of the people. The great principle put forward by Lenin in his article "Party Organization and Party Literature" in 1905 was put into practice.

In this article, Lenin exposed the hypocritical "freedom" of bourgeois artists, writing: "It is impossible to live in society and yet be free from society. The freedom of bourgeois writers, artists, and actors is nothing more than a secret (or falsely decorated) dependence on purses, bribes, and subsidies."

Lenin went on to point out that proletarian literature cannot be non-political, cannot be "art for art's sake," but must play an important progressive role in public life. Lenin tirelessly fought for this principle after the October Revolution.

It was even more necessary to carry out this struggle in the early years of the establishment of the Soviet system, because at that time bourgeois writers particularly stubbornly put forward the idea of so-called "pure art." They demanded that at least poetry be left to them as a refuge from the revolutionary reality they hated so much. The influence of these openly hostile forces also extended to certain literary groups that claimed to support the proletariat. For example, we have already seen that one of the basic principles of "Proletarian Culture" was that it strived to be "independent" and strive for its own "autonomy" from the Party.

Lenin and Stalin relentlessly exposed all such empty talk about so-called "neutrality," stripping off the so-called "non-partisan" masks of those who made such arguments, pointing out that these masks often always concealed the stubborn enemies of the revolution and the Soviet people.

The Central Committee of the Party, in its letter on "Proletarian Culture," emphasized that it was precisely this defense of the demand for "independence" from the Party and the Soviet government, the dissemination of sectarianism, and the isolation from the people that inevitably made "Proletarian Culture" a tool for bourgeois influence on the working class. This "independent" position only benefited the bourgeoisie.

Under the guise of "Proletarian Culture," they supplied the workers with bourgeois philosophical views (Machism). And in the field of art, they tirelessly taught the workers absurd and vile tastes (Futurism).

This letter is a true historical document, showing how keenly Lenin pursued literary issues. It once again affirmed Lenin's principle that, from the Party's point of view, literature is an integral part of the common cause of the proletariat and the entire people. The letter advocated "not in words, but in action," to create "a true proletarian culture," that is to say, to create a culture and literature that is full of the spirit of the Party and in line with the interests of the working class and the working peasants.

The letter said: "The best working-class members of 'Proletarian Culture' will fully understand what motivates our Party Central Committee."

"The Central Committee wants to create healthier and more normal conditions for it (the working-class intellectuals) and give it a full opportunity to participate in all aspects of artistic activities."

Creating "healthier and more normal conditions" meant ending the guidance of young proletarian writers by bourgeois intellectuals who were linked to decadent bourgeois literature and detached from the masses.

At the same time, the Central Committee and the Party demanded that there should be no "pettty guardianship" (Petty guardianship) over writers. Therefore, the principle that Lenin said in his article "Party Organization and Party Literature" that "literary undertakings, in particular, cannot be subjected to mechanical equalization or levelling, "In this undertaking, it is absolutely necessary to guarantee a wider scope for individual creativity and personal preferences, and to guarantee full freedom for ideas and imagination, form and content," this principle had to be adopted under the new historical conditions that were occurring at that time.

Regarding the great educational value of literature, Lenin pointed out that its power lies in faithfully reflecting reality and concretely describing the construction of a new life. "...Pay more attention to the simplest but most vital facts of communist construction, facts taken from life and tested by life - this is the slogan that all of us, our writers, agitators, propagandists, organizers, etc., should constantly repeat."

In putting forward this demand to writers, Lenin pointed out the fundamental direction that their work should take.

However, concrete reality, the vivid experience of the working people in socialist construction, can only be expressed by writers who are closely integrated with this reality and with the masses. Lenin advised writers to immerse themselves in the depths of life and maintain close ties with the people. We can find this advice in a letter that Lenin wrote to Gorky at that time.

Lenin did not limit the task of writers to passively reflecting life phenomena. He demanded that reality be expressed in the course of revolutionary development of reality. He demanded that the sprouts of new things be described, and the struggle of new things to overcome old things. Therefore, even at that time, Lenin had already outlined the important principles of socialist realism, which were later refined by Stalin.

Lenin wrote in his article "The Current Tasks of the Soviet Government":

"What is truly noteworthy in the era of great leaps forward is that the fragments of the old system are so numerous, and sometimes accumulate faster than the sprouts of the new system (which cannot always be seen at a glance), which makes us good at extracting the most important links from the line or chain of development. There are historical moments when the most important thing for the sake of the ultimate victory of the revolution is to accumulate more fragments, that is, to destroy more old organs; there are also other moments when destruction is enough, and the current thing is some ordinary work ('boring' work in the eyes of petty-bourgeois revolutionaries), that is, the work of clearing fragments; in addition, there is a moment when the most important thing is to carefully nurture the sprouts of the new system growing out of the fragments on the soil where the rubble has not been completely cleared."

Lenin used these brilliant words to unfold a brand new vista for literature.

Since the main achievement of the classical literature of critical realism lies in its destruction of the old reality, the main task of the young Soviet literature is to affirm the new socialist reality and its newborn branches.

Lenin taught writers not to be discouraged even if the new sprouts are often weaker than the old ones at the beginning, because the future still belongs to them.

When it comes to the description of new things, the question of the innovation of Soviet literature arises. Bourgeois artists regard literary innovation as a collection of various formalistic distortions, and try their best to deny the importance of artistic content; while the Bolshevik Party teaches us that the innovation of Soviet literature and art must first be determined by a new content. New ideas, new heroes, a new moral criterion, etc., all of this is a prerequisite for the birth of new forms of Soviet literature and art. It was no accident that Mayakovsky, the great innovator of Soviet poetics, once declared: "Only the October Revolution produced new great ideas, which required new forms."

Although Lenin paid great attention to the publication of new things, he believed that it was very important to strictly check whether all these publications were truly revolutionary and communist.

Everyone will remember that in those years, futurists, imagists, and other decadent groups attempted to offer their wares as the one and only communist art. Lenin sharply criticized this false innovation. In a conversation with Zetkin, he said:

"Why must we worship everything new as a god, just because 'it is new'? Nonsense, complete nonsense! All this is absurd, and, of course, it is an unconscious worship of the fashions popular in Western art...I cannot regard the works of expressionism, futurism, cubism, and all other 'isms' as the highest expression of artistic genius...I get no pleasure from those things."

It is worth noting here that Lenin not only exposed the false lies of this "innovation," but also exposed its source as flattering the bourgeois West.

At the same time, Lenin paid great attention to and cared about all the truly new phenomena in literature (including foreign literature), and greatly praised works such as Barbusse's "Under Fire" and "Light."

In accordance with Lenin's instructions, the issue of the mass nature of literature is now raised in a completely new way.

Immediately after the October Revolution, Lenin pointed out and then emphasized that "history is now being independently created by millions of people," and that the masses have become the true masters of history. For Soviet writers, it is not enough to have common feelings with the masses or to help them in their struggle for liberation, because the best writers of the past had this characteristic; they must now do more; now they must regard the working people, workers and peasants, as the masters of history, the builders of a new life. In the early years after the civil war, Soviet writers had already reflected the brilliant achievements of the masses in their work. It is enough to mention Serafimovich's "Iron Flood," Furmanov's "Chapayev," and Gladkov's "Cement," etc.

Lenin's opinion on the issue of the people's nature of literature is that it is not only about writing about the people, but also about writing for them.

Lenin said to Zetkin: "...We should always keep the workers and peasants in our minds. For their purpose, we must learn to manage things. This can also be applied to art and culture." He further told her: "Art belongs to the people. It must be deeply rooted in the working masses. It must be understood and loved by these masses. It must unite and elevate the emotions, thoughts, and will of these masses."

Lenin's demand that literature must be close to the people is linked to his principle that writers must write for the people. Lenin advocated that it is precisely for the masses, precisely for the broad ranks of the people, that we must write clearly and understandably.

Lenin's instructions to think about the workers and peasants and to speak clearly and understandably are fundamentally different from the doctrines of decadent bourgeois literature. The characteristics of bourgeois literature are just the opposite: the embellishment of rhetoric, the accumulation of complex forms and structures, they are writing for a small group of artists and noble figures.

This is why Lenin always warmly welcomed books that were written in simple language, described vividly, and could be understood and appreciated by ordinary working people.

However, although Lenin demanded that literature must be accessible to the working masses, he also taught us: "Do not be vulgarized, do not fall to the level of undeveloped readers, but steadily improve their level of development." Therefore, writers have no right to follow the reader's tail for the sake of popularization, on the contrary, they must lead them.

Finally, it must be mentioned that Lenin emphasized very early on the issue of the authenticity of literature.

Lenin attached great importance to authenticity, believing that this authenticity is the main source of our propaganda power. At the Eighth All-Russian Congress of Soviets, he emphasized that the reason why our propaganda "has been able to achieve world-renowned success is because our propaganda to the world is to tell the workers and peasants the truth, while all other propaganda is to tell them lies."

Regarding literature, Lenin believed that whether a work is authentic or not is the most important criterion for its artistic power. He demanded that writers should know the events they describe and the facts they cite, and not know them superficially, but know them completely and in detail. A writer can only gain such knowledge by actively participating in the lives and struggles of the people.

This is the outline of literature that Lenin drew in his writings in the early years of the Soviet regime. Later, this program was further developed and supplemented by Stalin - Lenin's closest student and successor to his cause, in accordance with the new historical situation.

These immortal ideas of Lenin are the source from which the high tide in Soviet culture, art, and literature now surges forward.

    列宁与苏维埃文学的产生  （续完）
    伊凡诺夫著
    华明译
    列宁把为富翁服务的资产阶级知识分子，与真诚愿为革命服务的真正有教养的知识分子加以区别。
    列宁写道“有教养的人们已经来到人民的一边，来到劳动者一边，而且正在帮助打破资本奴仆们的抵抗。
    这样的人的数目一天一天地多起来。在革命前的资产阶级贵族文学的代表中，有这样一些文化教育的泰斗，例如著名的诗人亚历山大·布洛克与瓦列里·布柳梭夫。布洛克与布柳梭夫，好象要证实上边所引列宁的话，在十月革命最初的那些日子，即来到革命阵营，把他们的天才供献给革命，尽管他们的从前的“朋友”对于他们的责骂象潮水一般涌来，这并不是偶然的。正是十月革命鼓励着布洛克去写出他的著名的“十二个”。
    在文学与艺术的领域中，苏维埃专家的训练，恐怕是最困难的任务。新作家只能从人民当中产生出来，人民就是产生天才之不竭的源泉。列宁说，只有在社会主义下，劳动人民“才能显露其能力，发展其才能，表现其天才，这些才能、天才，是人民中的一种无尽藏的泉源，而资本主义则成千成万地把它们压碎、摧残、绞杀。”
    在劳动人民中去发现天才，把他们造就成为一切活动领域（包括文艺在内）中的专家，是头等任务之一。“无产阶级文化”极力想插手这件事情。顾名思义，这个组织曾经宣布其宗旨为精心研究无产阶级文化。但是它没有成功，而且也不能成功，因为它把基础放在错误的哲学与组织的前提上，这就不能不把他们引导到严重的政治错误，最后的分析，就是引向失败。
    “无产阶级文化”的最大错误，就在于它排斥过去的文化，同列宁所说要批判地吸收之的方针是背道而驰的。
    “无产阶级文化”的错误，还在于企图用实验室的方法去“创造”新的无产阶级文化。
    按照“无产阶级文化”的“理论家”的意见，社会主义文化既不是在新社会的建设过程中建立起来的，也不是在与资产阶级思想影响的斗争中建立起来的，而是在那些脱离生活与斗争的，供作培养新文学与新艺术的“制作家”的温室的特别学术机关中、研究室中建立起来的。这种意见否认劳动群众对于社会主义文化之建立会有什么影响，这种观念认为：“专家们”把制作好了的“无产阶级文化”。奉献给工人阶级，而工人阶级则只等着去享用就是。
    “无产阶级文化”关于文化事业，使它自己离开共产党与苏维埃政府，说要保持它的“独立性”与“独占权”，这种倾向也是根本错误的。
    因此，无产阶级文化研究室发现。他们自己脱离了群众，在他们周围不能激起任何反应。从工人阶级中出来的诗人和艺术家，也都在这些研究室中脱离了他们的本阶级，证明了他们不能创造任何新文化。他们为资产阶级的诗学所迷惑，而且常常滑入小资产阶级的放荡情绪之中。
    列宁讽刺地嘲笑了“无产阶级文化”所企图的要“栽培一种无产阶级文化”的幼稚可笑的方法。列宁主张大规模地提高一切劳动人民的文化水平，推进公众教育（包括高等教育在内）。他认为这才是训练我们所需要的促进新的社会主义文化的人民的道路。
    在内战以后，为列宁所视为社会主义建设成功必要前提之一的文化革命，已经提到议事日程上来了。
    在提出文化革命的思想时，列宁驳斥了第二国际机会主义者的一个基本教条，他们断言，无产阶级革命，必须先有一批在资本主义条件下训练好了的无产阶级文化与行政的干部，只有在有了这样训练好了的干部之后，无产阶级才能取得政权。这个教条也为俄国孟塞维克（包括“无产阶级文化”的“领袖”巴格达诺夫）所倡导。列宁对于这种出自小资产阶级民主派的怯懦的论断，给予了一个毁灭性的打击。
    “如果说建设社会主义需要有相当的文化水准（虽然谁也不能说，这个相当的“文化水准”究竟怎样），那我们为什么不能首先用革命手段争得造成这个相当水准的必要前提，然后就在工农政权和苏维埃制度的基础上走向前去，追上其他各民族呢？”
    在提出文化革命的思想时，列宁还拟定了实行文化革命的实际方法与手段，即在苏维埃制度的基础上训练文化大军。
    列宁与斯大林制定了一系列的提高城乡以及各边疆民族劳动人民文化水准的方案。
    这些方案，后来几年，在苏维埃文学的发展上，起了重大作用。群众，当把文化介绍给他们时，即开始从他们自己的队伍中培养出来了苏维埃作家的主力。因此，关于文学，这是一种长期的政策。
    苏维埃政府与共产党自然不能把他们自己仅仅限制在期望将来上，即在当时，人民就需要一种帮助他们保卫苏维埃共和国和建设社会主义的文学。事实上，这样一种文学，在革命之始即存在着了。
    伟大的诗人马雅可夫斯基，除了较大的作品如“一亿五千万”“神秘的喜剧”等等之外，还写了很多充满革命热情的诗。
    在这些年中，诗人在他的工作中，花费了很多时间，为俄国电讯社“罗斯达”写了许多以诗标题的宣传广告。
    德穆扬·白德尼的诗，在内战几年中达到了它的顶点。他的许多诗，当时在前线红军与后方劳动人民中，成为非常普遍流行的读物。
    在内战结束后不久，绥拉菲莫维奇的“铁流”，富曼诺夫的“夏伯阳”，格拉德科夫的“土敏土”，以及其他苏维埃文学的一些杰作，都出现了。特别伟大的，是在这时期也是高尔基的全部生活中高尔基所起的作用，他是伟大的无产阶级作家，社会主义的现实主义的创建者，他不仅是较老一代无产阶级作家的导师，而且是整个苏维埃作家的导师。
    除了在建设新文化中的组织工作的繁重任务外，高尔基在苏维埃建设的时期，还写作了“我的大学”，“阿尔达莫诺夫”，“克里姆·萨姆金”等等这样一些杰作。
    除了这些著名作家，还有许许多多不知名的青年诗人与散文作家，他们都充满了革命热情，这些作家后来都在苏维埃文学中赢得盛名。
    这些作家享有苏维埃政府的经常支持与关怀。在苏维埃政权建设的初年，列宁虽然成天忙于指导战争与复杂的经济问题，但他仍然非常注意有关文化尤其是文学的问题。在那时候，苏维埃作家们已曾从列宁那里得到极有价值的指示，这些指示引导他们走上正确道路。一九二○年末，在内战的主要战线上的战争行动刚刚终止之后，俄罗斯共产党（布）中央委员会即根据列宁的建议通过并公布了一封讨论“无产阶级文化”关于文化与文学问题的特别的信。
    象往常一样，苏维埃政府在文学领域中所采取的政策，也是显著的表现了为艺术的党性、为艺术与共产党政策之间的密切结合、艺术与工人阶级及最广泛的人民群众的利益之间的密切结合而斗争的精神。列宁于一九○五年在“党的组织与党的文学”一文中所提出的伟大原则，被贯彻到实践中去了。
    列宁在这篇文章中揭露了资产阶级艺术家的虚伪的“自由”，他写道：“生活在社会之中而又超脱于社会之外，是不可能的。资产阶级的作家、艺术家、剧人的自由，不过是对于钱囊、贿买、津贴之秘密的（或虚伪地装饰的）依赖而已。”
    列宁继又指出：无产阶级文学，不能是非政治的，不能是“为艺术而艺术”的，而是要在公众生活中起一种重要进步作用的。列宁在十月革命后即不倦地在为这种原则而斗争着。
    进行这种斗争，在苏维埃制度建立的最初几年中更属必要，因为那时资产阶级作家特别顽强地提出所谓“纯艺术”的观念，他们要求至少要把诗给他们留作逃避其所非常痛恨的革命现实的一个避难所。这些公然仇视革命的势力的影响，也伸展到某些自命为拥护无产阶级的文学团体。例如我们已经看到“无产阶级文化”的基本原则之一，就是它力求离开党而“独立”，争取它自己的“自治权”。
    列宁与斯大林无情地揭露了一切这种关于所谓“中立”的空谈，剥去发这种议论的人们的所谓“无党无派”的假面具。指出这种假面具常常总是掩盖着革命与苏维埃人民之顽固成性的敌人。
    党的中央委员会，在其论“无产阶级文化”的信中着重指出：正是这种要求离开党与苏维埃政府而“独立”的辩护，宗派主义的传播，在人民当中的孤立，才不可避免地使“无产阶级文化”成为资产阶级影响工人阶级的一种工具。这种“独立”立场，只是有利于资产阶级。
    在“无产阶级文化”的伪装之下，他们以资产阶级的哲学观点（马赫主义）供应工人们。而且在艺术领域中，他们以荒谬的、恶劣的趣味（未来主义）孜孜不倦地教诲工人们。
    这封信是一种真正的历史文献，显示列宁是如何锐敏地追逐着文学问题。它再一次确定了列宁的原则，即：从党的观点说，文学是构成无产阶级与全体人民共同事业的一部分。这封信主张：“不是在口头上，而是从行动上”，去创造“一种真正的无产阶级文化”，那就是说，要创造一种充满党的精神与符合工人阶级与劳动农民利益的文化与文学。
    信中说：“在‘无产阶级文化’中最好的工人阶级分子将会充分懂得支配着我们党中央委员会的动机是什么。”
    “中央委员会想为它（工人阶级知识分子）创造更健康和正常的条件，并给它一个充分参加各方面艺术活动的机会。”
    创造“更健康和正常的条件”，意即结束资产阶级知识分子方面对于年青的无产阶级作家们的指导，这种资产阶级知识分子，是与颓废的资产阶级文学相联系而与群众相脱离的。
    同时，中央委员会与党要求对于作家不应有“小监护制”（Ｔｅｔｔｙ  ｇｕａｒｄｉａｎｓｈｉｐ）。因此，列宁在“党的组织与党的文学”那篇文章中所说“文学事业尤其不能服从于机械的平均化、水平化”（Ｍｅｃｈａｎｉｃａｌ  ｅｑｕａｌｉｇａｔｉｏｎ  ｏｒ  ｌｅｖｅｌｌｉｎｇ），“在这种事业里，为个人的创造性，个人的好尚保证较宽大的范围，为思想与想象，形式与内容保证充分自由，是绝对必要的，”这种原则是在当时所发生的新的历史条件下所必须采取的。
    关于文学之重大的教育价值，列宁指出：它的力量在于忠实地反映现实，具体地描写新生活的建设，“………更多地注意共产主义建设之最简单的可是最有生命的那些事实，取自生活而又为生活所考验了的那些事实——这是我们大家，我们的作家，鼓动家，宣传家，组织家等等所应不断反复重复的口号。”
    在给作家提出这种要求时，列宁就是这样指出他们的工作所应采取的根本方向。
    然而，具体的现实，在社会主义建设中劳动人民之生动的经验，只有那与这种现实，与群众密切结合的作家，才能表现出来。列宁劝告文学家们要潜沉到生活的深处，与人民保持密切联系。这种劝告，我们在列宁当时写给高尔基的一封信中就可以找到。
    列宁并不把作家的任务限制于消极地反映生活现象。他要求要在现实的革命发展过程中去表现现实。他要求要去描写新事物的萌芽，描写新事物战胜旧事物的斗争。因此，即在那时，列宁即已提出了社会主义的现实主义之重要原则的轮廓，而后来又为斯大林所精细的规定之。
    列宁在其所写“苏维埃政权的当前任务”一文中写道：
    “伟大跃进时代之真正足以注意的地方，就在于旧制度的碎片极多，并且有时比新制度的幼芽（不是常常可以一眼看到的）的数量积累得更快些，这就使我们要善于从发展路线或链条中抽出最重要的环节。有这样的历史时机，这时为谋革命底胜利，最重要的是在多积累些碎片，即是多破坏些旧机关；也有另一种时机，即在破坏已经足够的时候，当前的事情是一些平凡的工作（在小资产阶级革命家看来是‘枯燥无味’的工作），即清除碎片的工作；此外还有一种时机，这时最重要的是在瓦砾还没有清除净尽的土壤上，殷勤地看护着从碎片下生长出来的新制度底幼芽。”
    列宁用这些辉煌的话给文学展开了一幅崭新的远景。
    既然批判的现实主义之古典文学的主要功绩，是在于它之破坏旧的现实，现在年青的苏维埃文学的主要任务，就是肯定新的社会主义现实及其新生的枝叶。
    列宁教导作家们，即令新的幼芽在开始时常常比旧的要微弱些，也不要失望，因为将来仍是属于它们的。
    谈到新事物的描写，于是就发生了苏维埃文学的革新问题。资产阶级艺术家把文学革新看作是由各种各样形式主义的歪曲东西所凑成的，极力否认艺术内容的重要性；而布尔塞维克党却教导我们：苏维埃文学与艺术的革新，首先必须是为一种新的内容所决定。新的观念、新的英雄、一种新的道德准绳等等，所有这一切，是决定苏维埃文艺的新形式降生的前提条件。马雅可夫斯基，苏维埃诗学的伟大革新者，有一次宣称：“只是十月革命产生了新的大观念，才要求新的形式，”这话不是偶然的。
    虽然列宁对于新东西的发表付予极大的注意，可是他认为：严格检查所有这一切发表的东西是否真正革命的与共产主义的，却是非常重要的。
    大家当会记得，在那些年，未来派、想象派以及其他的颓废派团体，都企图把他们的货色当作惟一无二的共产主义艺术提供出来。列宁峻烈地批评过这种假的革新。在他与蔡特金的一次谈话中，他说：
    “为什么我们一定要把凡是新的都崇奉如神，仅仅只是因为‘它是新的’呢？胡说，完全胡说！所有这些，全是诞妄，而且，自然，这是对于流行于西方艺术的时髦之不自觉的崇拜。……我不能把表现主义、未来主义、立体主义以及一切其他‘主义’的作品视为艺术天才之最高表现……我从那些东西得不到一点愉快。”
    这里值得注意的是列宁不仅揭露了这种“革新”的虚伪说谎，而且也暴露了它的根源是对资产阶级西方献媚。
    同时，列宁对于文学（包括外国文学）中的一切真正新的现象，非常注意和关心，非常称赞象巴比赛的“火线”与“光明”这样的作品。
    遵照列宁的指示，文学之群众性的问题，现在是以一种完全新的方法被提出来。
    刚在十月革命后，列宁即已指出而且随后还加以强调，说：“历史现在是独立地被千百万人民所创造着”，并且群众已经成了历史的真正主人。对于苏维埃作家，仅仅与群众有共同感情或在他们的解放斗争中帮助他们，那是很不够的，因为过去的最好作家都具有这种特点；他们现在必须作得更多些；现在要把劳动人民、工人和农民，当作历史的主人，新的生活的建设者去看待。在内战后的最初几年中，苏维埃作家已经反映了群众在工作中的光辉业迹。这只提到绥拉菲莫维奇的“铁流”，富曼洛夫的“夏伯阳”，格拉德科夫的“士敏土”等等就够了。
    列宁对于文学之人民性质的问题的意见，认为不仅是要写关于人民的东西，而且要为他们而写。
    列宁对蔡特金说：“……我们应当常常把工人和农民放在我们的心目中。为了他们的目的，我们必须学习管理事情。这也可以适用于艺术与文化”。他更进一步告她说：“艺术是属于人民的。它必须深深植根于劳动群众之中。它必须为这些群众所懂得，所爱好。它必须把这些群众的情绪、思想与意志结合起来，并提高他们。”
    列宁要求文学必须接近人民，是与他所说作家必须为人民而写作的原则相联系的。列宁主张：正是为了群众，正是为了广大人民队伍，必须写得明白晓畅。
    列宁的这种要去想工人和农民，要说得明白易懂的指示，是与没落的资产阶级文学的教义有根本的差别。资产阶级文学的特点正与此相反：词藻的粉饰雕琢，形式与结构的堆砌复杂，他们是为一小群美术家与高贵人物而写作的。
    这就是为什么列宁看到那些写得语言简明，描写生动，能为普通劳动人民所了解欣赏的书，他总是那样热烈地欢迎。
    但是，虽然列宁要求文学必须是能接近劳动群众的，他却又教导我们：“不要流于庸俗化，不要降到未发展的读者的水平，而要稳步地提高其发展的水平。”因此，作家没有权利为了通俗化之故而去跟着读者的尾巴跑，相反的，必须去领导他们。
    最后还必须提到一个问题，列宁在很早时候即已非常强调讲过的，即文学的真实性问题。
    列宁对于真实性赋与非常巨大的重要性，他认为：这种真实性，乃是我们宣传力量的主要源泉。在第八次全俄苏维埃代表大会上，他着重指出我们的宣传之所以“能够取得世界闻名的成功，是因为我们在全世界的宣传，当是告诉工农以真理，而一切其他的宣传，则是告诉他们以谎言。”
    关于文学，列宁认为：一种作品真实与否，是它的艺术力量之最重要的标准。他要求作家应当知道他所描写的事变及其所引证的事实，而且不是表皮地知道它们，而应是完全地详细地知道它们。一个作家要能够得到这样知识，就只有积极参加人民的生活和斗争。
    列宁在苏维埃政权最初几年，在其著作中所描画的文学大纲的轮廓就是如此。后来这一纲领又为斯大林——列宁的最亲密的学生及其事业的继承者，按照新的历史形势而更进一步发展和补充了。
    列宁的这些不朽的观念，是现在苏维埃文化、艺术与文学中的高潮所由汹涌向前的源泉。
