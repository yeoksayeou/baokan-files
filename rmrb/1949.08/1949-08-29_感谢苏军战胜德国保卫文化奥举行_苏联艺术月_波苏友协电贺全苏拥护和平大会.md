　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 28th: TASS reports: The "Soviet Art Month" sponsored by the Austrian Committee for Promoting Cultural and Economic Relations with the Soviet Union was inaugurated on the 23rd in the Great Hall of the Vienna Music Hall. Soviet singers and musicians participated in the grand chorus held after the meeting. Austrian parliamentarian Fischer, in his speech at the celebration, emphasized the great importance of the Soviet army in defeating Hitler's Germany. He said: Currently, many people talk about "European culture" and "forget" that European culture was saved only by relying on the immeasurable heroism of the Soviet army. If it were not for the victory over Fascism, there would be no such thing as Europe, Austria, and its culture as we know it today. After recounting the rich heritage of the Soviet classical art treasury, the achievements of Soviet culture, and the importance of Soviet-Austrian cultural relations, he pointed out that Austria needs friendship with the Soviet Union. Whoever undermines Austria's economic ties with the Soviet Union is forcing our country into the abyss. Every advocate of peace is a fighter for friendship with the Soviet Union.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 28th: Polish Press Agency, Warsaw: The Central Committee of the Polish-Soviet Friendship Association, representing 1.5 million members, sent a warm telegram of congratulations to the All-Soviet Union Peace Conference. The telegram stated: We will forever and firmly remember that the invincible Soviet army liberated Poland from Nazi occupation, and the Soviet Union has provided Poland with multifaceted assistance after the war. We will deepen Polish-Soviet friendship and serve the Polish people, the independence of democratic Poland, and peace.

　　感谢苏军战胜德国保卫文化奥举行“苏联艺术月”
    波苏友协电贺全苏拥护和平大会
    【新华社北平二十八日电】塔斯社讯：奥地利促进对苏文化及经济联系委员会所主持的“苏联艺术月”已于二十三日在维也纳音乐堂大厅揭幕。苏联的歌手与音乐家参加了会后举行的大合唱。奥议员费契尔在庆祝会上的演说强调苏军对战胜希特勒德国的极大重要性。他说：目前，许多人谈论“欧洲文化”，而“忘记了”欧洲文化只是依靠着苏军不可衡量的英雄主义才得获救。如果不是战胜法西斯主义，目前便不会有我们所谓的欧洲、奥地利及其文化的存在。在追述苏联古典艺术宝库的丰富的遗产、苏联文化的成就和苏奥文化关系的重要性之后，他指出，奥地利需要与苏联友好。谁破坏奥地利与苏联经济上的连系，谁就是迫使我们的国家坠入深渊。每一个和平的拥护者都是与苏联友好的战士。
    【新华社北平二十八日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：波苏友好协会中央委员会代表一百五十万会员向全苏联拥护和平大会致热烈的贺电。该电称：我们将永远地、而且牢牢地记着：无敌的苏军从纳粹的占领下解放了波兰，苏联在战后给了波兰多方面的援助。我们将加深波苏友谊，为波兰人民、民主波兰的独立与和平而服务。
