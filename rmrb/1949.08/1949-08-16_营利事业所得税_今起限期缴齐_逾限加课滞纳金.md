Profit-seeking Enterprise Income Tax
　Deadline Today for Full Payment
　Late Payments Subject to Surcharge
　　[Our Newspaper] The assessment and evaluation of profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the second half of the 37th year of the Republic of China in the city of Beiping has been basically completed, and the tax points for each industrial and commercial household can be assessed successively. The Beiping Municipal People's Government, in order to take into account the ability of industry and commerce, which is still in the process of recovery, has adopted a principle of leniency in determining the tax amount this time, setting the tax amount per point at 1,000 yuan. Payments will begin on the 16th of this month. In order to facilitate tax payments for merchants and residents, the Beiping Branch of the People's Bank of China has been consulted and has agreed that designated banks in areas with bank branches will collect the payments on behalf of the government. In areas without bank branches, payments should be made to the tax sub-bureau of the district. In order to prevent individual industrial and commercial households from delaying or defaulting on payments, the Beiping Tax Bureau has specially stipulated the following payment methods: (1) Each industrial and commercial household must pay within ten days of receiving the payment notice (those with large tax amounts can pay in installments during this period). (2) Those who exceed the deadline will have the original tax amount increased according to the bank's real-time exchange rate on the date of issuance of the payment notice, and will also be subject to a late payment surcharge: 10% for those exceeding the deadline by up to five days, 20% for those exceeding the deadline by six to ten days, and 50% for those exceeding the deadline by eleven to twenty days. (3) Those who exceed the deadline by more than twenty-one days will be treated as tax evasion and handed over to the judicial authorities for handling.
