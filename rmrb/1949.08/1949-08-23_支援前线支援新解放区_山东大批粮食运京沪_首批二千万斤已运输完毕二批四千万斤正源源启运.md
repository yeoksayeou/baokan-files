　　Supporting the Front Lines and Newly Liberated Areas
  　Large Quantities of Grain from Shandong Transported to Beijing and Shanghai
    The First Batch of 20 Million Jin Has Been Completely Transported; The Second Batch of 40 Million Jin is Being Shipped Continuously
    [Jinan News] In response to the call of the East China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party to support the army's southward advance and the newly liberated cities, and to smash the enemy's blockade, Shandong Province is transferring 60 million jin of grain to Beijing and Shanghai in July and August. After the Provincial Grain Bureau accepted the task of transferring 20 million jin of wheat to Beijing and Shanghai in early July, it immediately sent personnel to various places to make arrangements. At that time, there was no preparation in advance, and it was also the time of the summer conscription and busy farming season, coupled with a lack of cadres and no experience in railway transportation, there were many difficulties, but thanks to the importance attached to this task from top to bottom, and the active support of the broad masses, the difficulties were finally overcome, and it was all completed by July 12. In completing this task, the responsible comrades of the relevant departments and the broad masses of employees were actively responsible, which made the work proceed smoothly. Teng, the director of the Provincial Grain Bureau, personally went to the station to understand the situation and negotiate for wagons, etc.; the Changwei Prefectural Commissioner's Office mobilized all the cadres of the commissioner's office to participate in helping to collect grain. All cadres and comrades of the No. 2 station of the No. 2 storage and transportation sub-bureau collected grain and loaded vehicles during the day, and guarded the grain at night. In early August, Shandong also accepted the task of transferring 40 million jin of grain to Beijing and Shanghai, and also sent people to various levels of bureaus at the beginning of the month to make arrangements and actively carry out the work. This batch of grain has begun to be transported south in a continuous stream since the 9th of this month.

　　支援前线支援新解放区
  　山东大批粮食运京沪
    首批二千万斤已运输完毕二批四千万斤正源源启运
    【济南讯】为响应中共华东局号召，支援大军南进，及支援新解放城市，纷碎敌人封锁，山东省于七、八两月向京沪调运粮食六千万斤。省粮食局于七月上旬接受调运二千万斤麦粮至京、沪的任务后，立即派员分赴各地布置。当时事前毫无准备，又值夏征、农忙之际，加以干部缺乏，铁路运输毫无经验，困难很多，但由于自上而下的重视这一任务，广大群众积极支援，终于克服了困难，至七月十二日即全部完成。在完成此项任务时，各有关部门负责同志及广大职工均积极负责，使工作进行顺利。省粮食局滕局长亲赴车站了解情况，交涉车皮等；昌潍专署曾动员专署全体干部参加帮助收粮。储运二分处二分站全体干部同志，白天收粮装车，夜间还站岗看粮。八月初旬，山东又接受了调运四千万斤粮食至京、沪的任务，亦于月初分头派至各级局布置，积极进行。该批粮食已于本月九日开始源源南运。
