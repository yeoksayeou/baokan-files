Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: TASS, Moscow, 14th: The Red Star newspaper published an article by Krainov titled "A Day of Great Significance in the History of the Korean People," commemorating the fourth anniversary of the Soviet Army's liberation of Korea. The author wrote: Four years ago, on August 15, 1945, the Soviet Army completely liberated Korea, which had been oppressed by Japanese imperialism for forty years. After completing the task of liberating Korea and helping the Korean people restore Korean national sovereignty and carry out democratic construction, the Soviet Army left Korea.

During the period since the Soviet Army liberated Korea, with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the Korean people have achieved great success in democratic development and in the economic and cultural progress of North Korea.

The author pointed out that while economic collapse, hunger, and poverty were ruling South Korea under the oppression of American capital, the working people of North Korea were successfully implementing their two-year plan for the restoration and development of the national economy and culture. In the past two years alone, North Korea's industrial production has increased by 2.6 times, and the output of its main industrial sector—the steel industry—has increased by 5.7 times. This year, the national economic plan is being successfully implemented.

North Korean agriculture has also made great achievements. Good harvests of grain have been obtained on the liberated land, which was distributed to the working farmers as early as 1946. The total grain output in North Korea has increased by more than 500,000 tons, and the number of livestock has doubled. Within three years, the sown area of ​​various grains has increased by 400,000 hectares.

The material life and cultural level of the working people of North Korea are continuously improving. The prices of necessities and food are decreasing, and the production of consumer goods is increasing. The most significant achievement is the cultural development of the North Korean people. Four years ago, North Korea had more than 2.5 million illiterate people. During this period, 90 percent of them have learned to read and write. The number of schools, technical schools, secondary schools, and universities, libraries, theaters, and clubs has greatly increased. Universal primary education will be implemented next year. The author also wrote: Due to the obstruction of the American ruling clique, Korea has not yet become a unified sovereign state. The American authorities stubbornly undermined the implementation of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference resolutions. After establishing a reactionary puppet regime in South Korea through unilateral actions, American expansionists began to turn South Korea into a fiefdom of Wall Street.

The people of South Korea resolutely demand the removal of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime and demand that the south of the country be peacefully unified with the democratic north to form a single, independent, and democratic country. An extremely important factor in the struggle for Korean unification and independence is the establishment in June of this year of the Democratic Fatherland United Front, which includes all progressive political parties and public organizations in the country.

The call of the Democratic Fatherland United Front to strive for peaceful reunification of the country has received full support among people of all strata in North and South Korea. The working people of South Korea have held strikes and demonstrations in many cities, demanding unification.

The author concluded by saying that the Korean people remember that the powerful Soviet Union is their liberator and their loyal defender of freedom and independence. This is why, on the fourth anniversary of the liberation of Korea, the eyes of millions of working people in Korea are again turned to the Soviet Union.

　　北鲜经济建设显著发展
  　南鲜要求清除李承晚伪政权
    红星报著文纪念苏军解放朝鲜四周年
    【新华社北平十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科十四日电：红星报登载克拉伊诺夫所著“朝鲜人民历史上意义重大的日子”一文，纪念苏军解放朝鲜第四周年。作者写道：四年前，一九四五年八月十五日，苏军完全解放了被日本帝国主义者压迫四十年的朝鲜。在完成解放朝鲜与帮助朝鲜人民恢复朝鲜的国家主权及进行民主建设的任务之后，苏军离开了朝鲜。
    在苏军解放朝鲜以来的期间内，朝鲜人民在苏联大公无私的援助之下，已在民主发展上，在北朝鲜的经济及文化进展上，获得巨大的成就。
    作者指出，当经济瓦解，饥饿和穷困正统治着美国资本压迫下的南朝鲜的时候，北朝鲜劳动人民则在顺利地实现其两年国民经济及文化的恢复与发展计划。仅在过去两年内，北朝鲜的工业生产量即增加到二点六倍，其主要工业部门——钢铁业的产量则已增加到五点七倍。今年，国民经济计划正在顺利地实现着。
    北朝鲜的农业同样也已获得巨大的成就。已获解放的土地上，谷物收获很好，这些土地早在一九四六年就分配给了劳动农民。北朝鲜的谷物总产量已增加五十万余吨，牲畜头数已增加一倍。三年之内，各种谷物的播种面积已增加四十万公顷。
    北朝鲜劳动人民的物质生活及文化水准，正在继续不断地提高。必需品和食品的价格正在降低，消费品的生产则在增加。最显著的是北朝鲜人民在文化发展上的成就。四年前，北朝鲜有二百五十万余文盲。在过去这一时期内，他们中间的百分之九十已学会阅读和写。学校，技术学校，中等学校和高等学校，图书馆，剧院及俱乐部的数目，已大大增加。普及初等教育将于明年实施。作者又写道：由于美国统治集团的阻挠，朝鲜迄今未成为统一主权的国家。美国当局顽固地破坏莫斯科外长会议决议的执行。在以单独的行动在南朝鲜建立反动的伪政权之后，美国扩张主义者开始把南朝鲜变为华尔街的封土。
    南朝鲜的人民坚决要求清除李承晚伪政权，要求该国的南部与民主的北部和平地统一起来，成为单一的独立民主国家。争取朝鲜统一与独立斗争中的极重要因素乃是今年六月包括全国各进步政党与公共团体的民主祖国联合阵线的建立。
    民主祖国联合阵线为争取全国和平统一而奋斗的号召，在南北朝鲜各阶层人民中间获得完全的拥护。南朝鲜劳动人民在许多城市中举行罢工与示威，要求统一。
    作者结语称，朝鲜人民记得，强大的苏联是他们的解放者和他们自由与独立的忠实维护者。这就是在朝鲜解放四周年之际，朝鲜千百万劳动人民的眼睛为什么再度转向苏联的原因。
