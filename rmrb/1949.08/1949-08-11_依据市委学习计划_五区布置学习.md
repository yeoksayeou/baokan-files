    According to Municipal Party Committee Learning Plan
    Five Districts Deploy Learning
    [This City News] The Fifth District of this city convened a symposium of heads of learning committees from various units on August 1st. Based on the on-the-job cadre learning plan formulated by the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, specific implementation measures were formulated.

    First, all cadres in the district are divided into four classes: A, B, C, and D, according to their theoretical level and educational background. It is stipulated that Class A should complete the History of Social Development in four weeks, and Class B in seven weeks; Class C should study Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on revising the Party Constitution, and The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party. In addition, various departments should appropriately conduct professional learning; Class D has a lower educational level and must study cultural courses every day.

    In the learning process, they are divided into three learning branches based on work units, with the responsible cadre of each unit serving as the director. The general learning association is led by the District Party Committee, and each learning branch is divided into several groups according to the scope of work, with every three people in the group forming a mutual aid group. Everyone unanimously abides by the two-hour daily learning system, and stipulates that a review meeting should be held once a week and a test should be held once every two weeks. The learning method is three days of self-study, with required study notes, followed by informal discussions in the mutual aid group, and questions raised to be submitted to the large group for discussion. Blackboards are published at any time to reflect the learning situation of each group and exchange experiences; wall newspapers are published regularly, publishing personal study心得, thoughts, and weekly learning summaries.

    After this plan was implemented on August 1st, the comrades' learning enthusiasm was extremely high. Currently, learning in all subjects is actively underway.

    依据市委学习计划
    五区布置学习
    【本市讯】本市第五区曾于八月一日召开各单位学委会负责人座谈会。根据市委宣传部所订在职干部学习计划，拟定了具据执行办法。
    首将全区干部依理论水平、文化程度分成甲、乙、丙、丁四班。规定甲班在四星期、乙班在七星期内学完社会发展史；丙班学习刘少奇同志的修改党章报告、中国革命与中国共产党，此外各部门更适当进行业务学习；丁班文化程度较低，每日须学习文化课。
    在学习中以工作单位分成三个学习分会，由各单位负责干部任主任，学习总会由区委领导，各学习分会按工作范围分成若干小组，小组中每三人为一互助小组。大家一致遵守每日两小时的学习制度，并规定每星期开检讨会一次，两星期举行一次测验。学习方式是三天自读，必须做读书笔记，然后由互助小组漫谈，提出问题交由大组讨论，并随时出版黑板报反映各组的学习情况，交流经验；定期出版壁报，刊载个人读书心得，感想与一周的学习总结。
    这个计划在八月一日开始施行后，同志们学习情绪极为高涨。现各科学习，都在积极开展中。
