Eliminate Special Agents and Bandits, Consolidate Revolutionary Order

One of the important schemes of foreign imperialists and their running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries, to oppose the Chinese people is to breed bandit forces, carry out counter-revolutionary riots, disrupt social order, block urban and rural transportation, contain the victorious southward advance of the People's Liberation Army, and undermine the construction of a new people's democratic China. The so-called "Wartime Administration Guidelines" of the bandit Yan Xishan proposed to "implement military-political coordination, strengthen provincial and county authority, develop mass armed forces, conduct guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, and implement total war." The so-called "mass armed forces" here are political bandits; the so-called "guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines" is to carry out harassment and sabotage against the people's motherland; the so-called "military-political coordination" and "implement total war" is to collude such special agent bandit forces with the remaining local reactionary regimes and reactionary forces, using a combination of political deception and armed sabotage to carry out the crime of harming the country and the people. Under this conspiracy, the Kuomintang bandit gang sent and pre-positioned special agent bandits to the liberated areas, colluding with local counter-revolutionary despotic landlords, collecting defeated scattered soldiers and remnants of bandits, using feudal superstitious organizations, and coercing backward masses to hold armed riots; while in the areas that have not yet been liberated, they are mobilizing all traitors, warlord bureaucrats, and other social scum, and relying on political power to organize so-called "Anti-Communist Self-Defense National Salvation Army" and other bandit forces, preparing to resist the People's Liberation Army when the opportunity arises. American imperialists place great hope on such special agent bandit forces, providing them with money and military supplies. Chinese and foreign reactionaries vainly attempt to rely on such bandit forces to carry out a desperate struggle, and prepare to collude with foreign interventionist armed forces, plotting a restoration. This wishful thinking of Chinese and foreign reactionaries is undoubtedly doomed to bankruptcy. Since the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army were able to annihilate the five million seven hundred thousand Kuomintang bandit troops fully supported by American imperialism and overthrow the twenty-two years of Kuomintang reactionary rule, it is of course not difficult to thoroughly eliminate the remaining forces of Chinese and foreign reactionaries—the special agent bandit forces, and consolidate the revolutionary order of the people's motherland. However, because this kind of political bandit is combined with local reactionary forces, and has the assistance of foreign interventionists, they are particularly rampant and particularly brutal, and have given and will continue to give the people of the motherland extremely significant harm. If we are arrogant and complacent because of the victory on the main front, numb and indifferent, underestimate this important armed enemy, have insufficient understanding of its destructiveness and harm, and think that these clowns are not worth bothering about, allowing them to develop and act freely, then we will make a major mistake! The leadership organs and staff in many places, because they hold a blind sense of peace, lose their class vigilance, and do not pay attention to timely extinguishing the bandits, so that the Party and the people have suffered many unnecessary losses, is that not enough to educate us?

Now, the broad masses of people in many newly liberated areas, after suffering twelve years of cruel exploitation and war disasters from Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gang, urgently demand the stability of social order, the smooth flow of urban and rural trade, and the restoration of normal economic life, so as to quickly heal the wounds of war destruction and reorganize their own families. However, the harassment and disturbances created by special agent bandits planned by American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, burning, killing, raping, and plundering, make it impossible for the people's demands to be realized. After the People's Liberation Army eliminates or defeats the Kuomintang bandit troops and liberates vast cities and villages, if many places are actually still controlled by special agent bandits and reactionary forces, then the policies and decrees of the people's government cannot be implemented, the old reactionary regime cannot be transformed, the people's burdens are difficult to reduce and equalize, disaster relief and water management and other urgent measures are also hindered, all revolutionary work cannot be carried out, urban and rural relations cannot be communicated, the Renminbi cannot occupy a broad market, economic life cannot be restored, the city will be isolated, and the countryside will be suffocated. Therefore, after getting rid of the oppression of the Kuomintang tyranny, special agent bandits are the most important and most hateful enemy of the people at present; and eliminating bandits and stabilizing people's livelihood has become a common and urgent demand of people of all strata. Therefore, mobilizing a large number of cadres and revolutionary workers and students to go to the countryside, cooperating with the armed forces of the People's Liberation Army, mobilizing the broad masses of peasants, eliminating bandits and special agents, overthrowing the rule of counter-revolutionary despotic elements, stabilizing order, developing production, and then systematically and step by step carrying out various social reforms, must inevitably become the central task of a period. The experience of many places tells us: in all newly liberated areas, there must first be a fairly long period of concentrating all efforts to carry out bandit suppression and anti-despot struggles, and destroy the Kuomintang reactionary ruling forces, in order to open up the situation and gain a firm foothold. This has almost become an inevitable process of struggle development, and anyone who does not seize this link in time will inevitably take a detour, and will eventually have to turn around and start again.

To achieve effective bandit suppression, first, it is necessary to seize the opportunity, establish unified leadership, plan and allocate forces, accurately grasp the situation, launch a comprehensive but focused suppression, not be afraid of fatigue, not be afraid of hardship, make long-distance raids, continuously pursue and annihilate, and strive to wipe them out in one fell swoop and eliminate the roots. In the newly liberated areas, as the People's Liberation Army advances, the Kuomintang bandit gang flees in panic. Often, many bandit soldiers, local reactionary teams, personnel of enemy and puppet regimes, and counter-revolutionary special agents flee in all directions. If they are not suppressed, they will quickly disperse and regroup, combine with local reactionary feudal forces, and occupy and cause chaos. Therefore, we should take advantage of the enemy's confusion and instability to carry out suppression as early as possible, and completely eliminate the remaining bandit forces, so as to avoid future troubles. In all areas where bandit suppression is carried out, it is necessary to eliminate hidden bandits, collect all bandit guns, arrest all bandit leaders, disintegrate bandit masses, destroy bandit special agent command organs, dissolve the secret societies used by bandits and special agents, and overthrow the reactionary despots who harbor bandits. Bandit suppression should not fight defeat battles, but should fight annihilation battles. If a defeat battle has already been fought due to circumstances, we should continue to pursue and encircle and eliminate it completely. Bandit suppression should not only take the number of people and guns seized from bandits as the only or main criterion for assessing achievements; but should achieve thorough elimination of bandit disasters, destroy the Kuomintang reactionary ruling forces—in the countryside, it is the reactionary despotic landlords, and politically mobilize the masses in a preliminary way. Therefore, the bandit suppression struggle is not only a military action, but also a political struggle and a mass movement. Bandit suppression must combine urban and rural areas, be carried out comprehensively, but also focus on key areas, so as to prevent bandits and special agents from taking advantage of loopholes, fleeing between cities and villages, between this county and that county, hiding and appearing alternately, while we can first thoroughly eliminate an area as a base, steadily advance, and also spread nets everywhere to capture.

Second, it is necessary to mobilize the masses, win over all social forces, and organize a unified front against bandits and anti-despot, so that this struggle becomes a vigorous mass movement. The armed forces responsible for bandit suppression must conduct short-term political and policy education, establish the determination to eliminate harm for the people and serve the people, learn the basic policies of the Party, and become a tenacious fighting team and a capable work team. The Party and government cadres, mass organization workers, and revolutionary workers and students who work in the countryside with the armed forces, in addition to studying politics and policies, must also understand some ordinary military knowledge, everyone is armed, and everyone is a soldier. These two forces come together to organize a powerful armed work team, on the one hand, to launch fierce military activities, resolutely and actively suppress bandits, and cover mass work; on the other hand, to mobilize the masses, carry out anti-bandit and anti-despot struggles, destroy counter-revolutionary ruling forces, establish people's democratic power, and mobilize mass forces to support the military actions of bandit suppression. In organizing the bandit suppression and anti-despot struggle, it is also necessary to combine it with other urgent demands of the masses at that time and place, and pay attention to benefiting the masses and eliminating malpractices. For example, at present, many newly liberated areas must pay attention to disaster relief and water management, rectify war services, oppose unfair apportionment by old township chiefs, reduce the people's burden, help the masses with autumn harvest production, and practice thrift and oppose corruption and waste, and so on. It is necessary to earnestly care about and solve the problems related to the vital interests of the masses, and in the process of carrying out these tasks, educate and guide the masses to realize that only by eliminating bandits and overthrowing reactionary forces can their political and economic status be further improved. In this way, the broad masses of the people participate in the bandit suppression and anti-despot struggle, report bandit information, expose special agents, and disintegrate bandit masses, and this struggle will easily achieve effective results.

Third, it is necessary to combine military and political affairs, combine suppression and appeasement, and truly grasp the principle of "the ringleaders must be punished, the coerced will not be held accountable, and meritorious service will be rewarded," to strike and disintegrate bandits, and finally achieve the goal of eliminating bandits. To deal with armed bandits and special agents, we must take proactive military action, give them a heavy blow, and show our strength, in order to force the enemy to disintegrate and surrender. However, at the same time as military action, we must launch a political offensive. First of all, publicize the current situation of the People's Liberation War among the broad masses of the people, point out the harm of bandits to the country and the people, that there is no way out for being a bandit, and if they do not turn back in time, they will inevitably be discredited, and explain the policies of the people's government on handling the bandit problem. At the same time, through various social relationships, especially self-reformed bandits and bandit families, use various forms to carry out disintegration and争取 work (winning over, trying to get them on side) against bandits. For bandit elements, it is necessary to distinguish between the leaders and the followers, and adopt a combination of leniency and suppression. Those who have done many evil deeds and are unrepentant should be resolutely suppressed; but those who have done little evil and are coerced should be given a chance to reform, and those who have performed meritorious service to redeem themselves should be given lenient treatment. It is absolutely impossible to implement one-sided, unprincipled leniency, causing the enemy to mistakenly believe that we are weak and can be bullied, and fueling the bandit's ferocity. It is also absolutely impossible to implement one-sided, unprincipled suppression, so that not only will it not disintegrate the bandit masses and isolate the ringleaders, but it will even promote internal unity among the enemy and resolutely confront the people. The so-called suppression is by no means a matter of killing everything without exception. Where conditions are met, courts and prisons should be established to sentence imprisonment and hard labor according to the size of the crime, and only those with heinous crimes should be executed. Whether leniency or suppression, mass meetings should be held as much as possible. At least announcements should be made to educate the masses and disintegrate the enemy.

### 肃清特务土匪，巩固革命秩序

    肃清特务土匪，巩固革命秩序
    外国帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派反对中国人民的重要阴谋之一，是繁殖土匪武装，进行反革命骚动，扰乱社会秩序，阻塞城乡交通，牵制人民解放军的胜利南进，并破坏人民民主新中国的建设事业。阎匪锡山的所谓“战时施政方针”，提出要“实行军政配合，加强省县职权，发展民众武装，进行敌后游击，贯彻总体战”。这里所谓“民众武装”，便是政治土匪；所谓“敌后游击”，便是对人民祖国进行骚扰破坏；所谓“军政配合”、“贯彻总体战”，便是要使这种特务性的土匪武装与残留的地方反动政权、反动势力勾结起来，以政治欺骗和武装捣乱相结合的办法，来进行祸国殃民的罪谋。在这种阴谋策划下，国民党匪帮对于已解放的地区，便派遣和预置特务匪徒，勾结当地反革命的恶霸地主，收罗被击溃的散兵残匪，利用封建迷信团体，胁迫落后群众，举行武装暴动；而在尚未解放的地区，则正在动员一切卖国奸贼、军阀官僚和其他社会渣滓，并依仗政治权力，组织所谓“反共自卫救国军”之类的土匪武装，准备待机反抗人民解放军。美国帝国主义者对于这种特务土匪武装寄予极大的希望，给予金钱和军火的接济。中外反动派妄图凭借这种土匪武装，进行垂死挣扎，并准备使之与外国干涉者武装互相勾结，图谋复辟。中外反动派的这个如意算盘无疑地是要破产的。中国人民和人民解放军既然能够歼灭美帝国主义全力支助下的五百七十万国民党匪军，推翻二十二年的国民党反动统治，当然不难彻底肃清中外反动派的残余势力——特务土匪武装，巩固人民祖国的革命秩序。然而，由于这种政治土匪与地方反动势力相结合，而且有着外国干涉者的援助，所以他们便特别猖獗，特别凶残，已经并将继续给予祖国人民以极其重大的危害。如果我们因为主力前线的胜利，而骄傲自大，麻木不仁，轻视这一重要的武装敌人，对于它们的破坏性和危害性认识不足，认为这辈小丑不值介意，听其自由发展和活动，那么我们将会犯重大的错误！许多地方的领导机关和工作人员因为抱着一种盲目的太平观念，丧失阶级警觉，没有注意及时扑灭土匪，以致使党和人民遭受许多不应有的损失，难道还不足以教育我们吗？
    现在，许多新解放区的广大人民，在饱受日本帝国主义和国民党匪帮十二年的残酷剥削和兵燹之灾以后，迫切地要求社会秩序的安定，城乡贸易的畅通，经济生活的恢复正常，以便迅速治好战争破坏的创伤，重整自己的家业。但美帝国主义和国民党反动派有计划地制造的特务土匪的骚扰作乱，烧杀淫掠，却使人民的要求无法实现。在人民解放军消灭或击溃国民党匪军，解放广大的城市和乡村以后，如果许多地方实际上仍为特务土匪和反动势力所控制，则人民政府的政策法令无法推行，旧的反动政权不能改造，人民的负担很难减轻和公平，救灾治水等急要之举也受到阻碍，一切革命工作无法展开，城乡关系不能沟通，人民币不能占领广大的市场，经济生活无法恢复，城市将被孤立，农村将被窒息。因此，在解脱国民党暴政的压迫之后，特务土匪便是人民当前最主要的和最可恶的敌人；而肃清土匪，安定民生，则成为各阶层人民共同的迫切要求。因此，发动大批干部和革命的工人、学生下乡，配合人民解放军的武装力量，动员广大农民，肃清土匪特务，推翻反革命恶霸分子的统治，安定秩序，发展生产，并进而有系统地有步骤地进行各种社会改革，便必然应该成为一个时期的中心任务。许多地方的经验都告诉我们：凡是新解放地区，起初必须有一个相当长的时期，集中全力进行剿匪反恶霸斗争，摧毁国民党反动统治势力，才能打开局面，站稳脚跟。这几乎已经成为斗争发展必经的过程，谁要是不及时地抓紧这一环节，便难免要走弯路，而且终究要回过头来重新做起。
    要求剿匪收到功效，第一，必须抓紧时机，建立统一领导，有计划地配备力量，确实掌握情况，展开全面的而又有重点的清剿，不怕疲劳，不畏艰苦，长途奔袭，连续追歼，务期一网打尽，斩草除根。在刚才新解放的地区，我解放大军锋势所向，国民党匪帮望风溃逃，往往有许多匪军散兵游勇、地方反动团队、敌伪政权人员、反革命特务分子流窜四方，如果不加扑灭，很快便会散而复聚，与地方反动封建势力结合，盘踞作乱。因此，应该乘敌昏迷混乱、立足未定的时候，及早进行清剿，彻底消灭残匪势力，以免养痈贻患。在一切实行剿匪的地区，必须做到肃清潜匪，收尽匪枪，捕尽匪首，瓦解匪众，摧毁匪特指挥机关，解散土匪特务所利用的会门，打倒通匪窝匪的反动恶霸。剿匪不要打击溃战，而要打歼灭战。如果因情况关系已经打了击溃战，就应继续追歼兜捕，把它消灭干净。剿匪不能仅仅以收缴土匪的人枪数字为考核成绩的唯一或主要标准；而应该做到澈底肃清匪患，摧毁国民党反动统治势力——在乡村里是反动的恶霸地主，在政治上初步地发动群众。因此，剿匪斗争不只是军事行动，而且应该又是政治斗争和群众运动。剿匪必须城乡结合，全面展开，而又有重点地进行，以免土匪特务利用空隙，流窜城市与乡村之间，这县与那县之间，潜形匿迹，此起彼伏，而我们则可首先彻底肃清一块地区作为依托，稳步前进，而又能四处张网捕捉。
    第二，必须发动群众，争取一切社会力量，组织剿匪反恶霸的统一战线，使这个斗争成为轰轰烈烈的群众运动。担任剿匪任务的武装部队，必须进行短期的政治和政策教育，确立为民除害、为民服务的决心，学会党的基本政策，成为顽强的战斗队而又是能干的工作队。而与武装部队一同下乡工作的党政干部和群众团体工作人员及革命的工人、学生，则除了学习政治和政策以外，还必须了解一些普通的军事知识，人各武装，人皆为兵。这两支力量汇合起来，就能组织强大的武装工作队，一面展开猛烈的军事活动，坚决地主动地清剿土匪，掩护群众工作；一面发动群众，进行反匪反恶霸斗争，摧毁反革命统治势力，建立人民民主政权，动员群众力量支援剿匪的军事行动。在组织剿匪反恶霸斗争中，又必须与当时当地群众其他迫切要求结合，注意为群众兴利除弊。例如，目前许多新解放区，都必须注意救灾治水，整顿战争勤务，反对旧乡保长摊派不公，减轻人民负担，帮助群众秋收生产，和厉行节约，反对贪污浪费等等。必须切实关心和解决关系群众切身生活利益的问题，并在进行这些工作之中，教育和引导群众认识只有肃清土匪，打倒反动势力，他们在政治上和经济上的地位才能得到进一步的改善。这样，广大的人民群众都参加剿匪反恶霸斗争，报告匪情，检举特务，瓦解匪众，这一斗争便容易收到成效。
    第三，必须军政结合，剿抚兼施，确实掌握“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”的原则，打击和瓦解土匪，最后达到消灭土匪的目的。对付武装的土匪特务，一定要采取主动的军事行动，予以沉重打击，显示出我们的力量，才能迫使敌人瓦解和投降。但与军事行动同时，必须展开政治攻势。首先，在广大人民群众中宣传目前人民解放战争的形势，指出土匪对于国家和人民的祸害，充当土匪毫无出路，若不及早回头，必致身败名裂，说明人民政府处理土匪问题的政策。同时，通过各种社会关系，特别是自新土匪和土匪家属，利用各种形式，对土匪进行瓦解争取工作。对于土匪分子，必须区分首从，采取宽大与镇压结合的办法。对于作恶多端、死不改悔分子，予以坚决镇压；但对那些作恶不多的胁从分子，应予自新机会，而对那些立功自赎的分子，则可予以宽大待遇。决不可实行片面的无原则的宽大，致使敌人误认我们软弱可欺，助长土匪凶焰。也决不可实行片面的无原则的镇压，以致不但不能瓦解匪众、孤立首恶，甚至反而促成敌人内部团结，与人民坚决对抗。所谓镇压，也决不是一律格杀勿论。凡是条件具备的地方，都应建立法庭、监狱，以便按照罪恶大小，分别判处徒刑、苦役，唯罪大恶极者才予处决。无论宽大或镇压，都应尽可能地召开群众大会。至少也要布告示众，用以教育群众，瓦解敌人。
