    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 2nd. Tito Group Continues to Provoke Albania with Armed Raids. The Albanian Workers' Party newspaper "People's Voice" recently published an editorial exposing how the Tito group, in collaboration with the Athens Royalist Fascists, frequently engages in provocations against Albania on its northern and southern borders, by sea, land, and air. These provocations include firing upon Albanian border posts, strafing Albanian villages with machine guns, and directing criminal bandits to invade Albanian territory, etc.

    Mr. Dishnica, Chargé d'Affaires of the Albanian Legation in Poland, stated that Tito's followers had interfered in Albania's internal affairs, forcibly imposing a customs union and unified currency on Albania. When their conspiracy was about to be exposed in 1948, they attempted to establish a joint command of the two countries' armies and planned to send Yugoslav troops to Albania. They demanded that Albania-Yugoslavia alliance follow the example of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The Albanian Chargé d'Affaires spoke of the interrogation of the Trotskyite group led by Hoxha (former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior of Albania). He said that the interrogation proved that the struggle of the Trotskyite Tito elements against the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had begun as early as 1943, when Tito tried to establish a Balkan General Command personally under his leadership. Hoxha and his accomplices attempted to merge the Yugoslav and Albanian armies, and planned to have a part of the Yugoslav army enter Albania under the pretext that the Greek Royalist Fascists were preparing to invade the country. The interrogation proved that the Trotskyite Tito group was preparing to annex Albania, and this group attempted to establish an Albanian federation to make it a "anti-Soviet bastion" in Southeast Europe to serve imperialism. The interrogation proved that Hoxha and his clique planned to overthrow the leading bodies and government of the Albanian party. But their plan failed. Hoxha has been sentenced to death.

    揭露铁托阴谋侵阿
    【新华社北平二日电】铁托集团不断向阿国进行武装挑衅。阿尔巴尼亚工人党机关报“人民之声”近发表社论，揭发铁托集团与雅典保皇法西斯分子联合，在阿尔巴尼亚的北部与南部，在海、陆、空三方面，时常进行挑衅。向阿边防哨开火，用机枪扫射阿村庄，指使罪犯匪徒侵入阿领土等等。
    阿驻波公使馆代办第什尼加，发表谈话称：铁托分子曾干涉阿尔巴尼亚的内政，强以关税同盟和统一的货币加诸阿尔巴尼亚，当一九四八年他们的阴谋快被揭穿时，他们曾试图建立两国军队的联合司令部，并拟派遣南斯拉夫军队到阿尔巴尼亚来。他们要求仿效荷、比、卢建立一个阿尔巴尼亚——南斯拉夫联盟。阿驻波代办谈及审讯霍克西（阿尔巴尼亚前副总理、内政部长）所领导的托洛斯基分子集团的情形。他说：审讯证明托洛斯基派铁托分子反对苏联共产党的斗争，早在一九四三年就已开始，那时铁托曾力图建立由他亲自领导的巴尔干总局司令部。霍克西和他的同伙曾企图合并南斯拉夫和阿尔巴尼亚的陆军，并图使南斯拉夫陆军一部在希腊保皇法西斯正准备对阿国侵略的借口下进入阿国。审讯证明了托洛斯基的铁托集团准备吞并阿尔巴尼亚，这个集团企图建立阿尔巴尼亚联邦，使之成为东南欧“反苏堡垒”，以服务于帝国主义。审讯证明霍克西和他的小集团计划推翻阿尔巴尼亚党的领导机构和政府。但他们的计划失败了。霍克西已被判处死刑。
