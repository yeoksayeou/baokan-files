    Elimination of Residual Reactionary Organizations
    70th Arsenal Disbands "Guard Team"
    [This City News] The "Guard Team," a remnant of the Kuomintang's rule within the 70th Arsenal, was disbanded on the 29th of last month. All 92 members of the team have completely left the factory.
    The "Guard Team" was a reactionary armed force used by the Kuomintang reactionaries to suppress workers and had always been opposed to the workers. Before liberation, workers were often searched and bullied by them when they left work. They used the excuse of checking household registrations to search all the workers' homes. Their acts of oppression against the workers were too numerous to mention. After liberation, workers repeatedly proposed disbanding the Guard Team and the factory's special agent organization, the "Inspection Group." At that time, the comrades who took over the factory obtained the consent of the Public Security Bureau and first disbanded the "Inspection Group." Regarding the "Guard Team," due to the unclear handling policy at the time, the factory temporarily retained it, intending to educate and reform it. Until recently, the factory received an order from the Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government, stating that because the workers had automatically organized a security team, and there were People's Liberation Army troops stationed in the factory for security, and because individual bad elements in the "Guard Team" were spreading rumors and causing confusion, it was decided to disband it. After contacting relevant authorities, the factory ordered the Guard Team to hand over its weapons and disbanded them on the 29th of last month. The method was to pay each person one and a half months' salary and send them home. Those who did not want to go home could join the army or study at a military and political university. For those who needed to walk a long distance, a corresponding subsidy was given according to the standard of business travel expenses.
    After the "Guard Team" was disbanded, some bad elements took advantage of the opportunity of demobilization to spread rumors and cause confusion, saying that the trade union had already printed retirement certificates and that workers would also be dismissed. In response, the trade union specially called on everyone on the blackboard newspaper to work together to expose these rumor-mongers in order to stabilize work and study morale. The cadres of the trade union also explained to the workers that the "Guard Team" and the workers were fundamentally different: the remaining reactionary armed forces should be disbanded; as for the workers' retirement certificates, this was by no means true.

    取消残余反动机构
    七十兵工厂遣散“警卫队”
    【本市讯】七十兵工厂内在国民党统治时期遗留下来的“警卫队”，已于上月二十九日遣散，全队九十二人，已完全离厂。
    “警卫队”是从前国民党反动派用来镇压工人的反动武装，一直是和工人对立的。解放前，工人下班时，常被他们搜查欺侮；他们曾借着查户口的名义，搜查过所有工人的住家；平日压迫工人的行为是举不胜举的。解放后，工人曾多次提议解散警卫队和该厂的特务组织“稽查组”。当时，该厂接管同志获得公安局同意，首先解散了“稽查组”。对于“警卫队”因当时处理方针不明确，所以厂方暂时予以保留，拟加以教育改造。直到最近，该厂接到华北人民政府企业部命令，由于工人已自动组织了保卫队，厂内还有人民解放军驻厂保卫，而且“警卫队”里有个别坏分子造谣惑众，乃决定予以遣散。该厂在与有关机关联络后，于上月二十九日，令警卫队交出武装，予以遣散。办法是每人发一个半月的薪金，遣散回家。不愿回家的，也可以参军，或入军政大学学习。对于路远需步行的人，还按出差费的标准，予以相当补助。
    “警卫队”被遣散后，曾有坏分子乘着转业的时机，造谣惑众，说职工会已印好退休书，工人也要被遣散。对此，职工会特在黑板报上，号召大家协力检举这些造谣分子，以安定工作学习情绪。职工会的干部们，并在工人中解释，“警卫队”和工人是根本不同的：残留的反动武装，理应遣散；至于工人退休书云云，绝非事实。
