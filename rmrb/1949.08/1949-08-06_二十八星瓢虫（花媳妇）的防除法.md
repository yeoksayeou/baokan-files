Prevention and Control of the Twenty-Eight Spotted Ladybug (Epilachna vigintioctopunctata)
Guo Yimin

(1) Serious Damage to Plants
The twenty-eight spotted ladybug, also known as the false ladybug (commonly known as "flower bride," "flower girl," or "tuber dan" in Chahar), is a gourd-shaped beetle, reddish-brown in color, with twenty-eight black spots of varying sizes on its elytra. It is a pest of solanaceous plants, feeding on the leaves of potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, etc. Sometimes it also feeds on non-solanaceous plants, such as melons and beans. In Chahar Province, potatoes suffer an annual loss of 20 to 40 percent, which is the most serious problem felt by the masses.

(2) Life History and Habits
This pest has two generations a year, overwintering as adults in mountain roots, wall crevices, or weeds. It lays eggs on the back of the leaves, standing upright in rows. The eggs hatch into larvae (oblong, yellow, with black branched bristles on the body) after five or six days. The larvae eat the leaf mesophyll, leaving only the veins and epidermis, causing the leaves to become reticulated, turn brown, and die. If leaves are scarce, they will also damage the stems and the outer layer of the fruit. After molting several times, the larvae pupate after about twenty-two days (the pupae are slightly rounded, yellow, with black stripes), neither eating nor moving, clinging tightly to the back of the leaf. The pupae turn into adults after seven days, and the adults lay eggs again after fifteen days. The first generation of adults appears in April and May, and the second generation appears in September and October, with the most severe damage occurring in July and August.

(3) Prevention and Control Methods
1. Catching Adults: Mobilize women and children to catch them together. This insect feigns death when shaken, remaining motionless for a short time, making it easy to catch. It is also easy to catch in the early morning and evening when it is less active.
2. Catching larvae, pupae, and collecting eggs are also effective. In addition, clearing weeds along the edges of fields and roads after autumn can also eliminate their overwintering habitats.
3. Poisoning with Chemicals: The "flower bride" is a chewing pest. Mix one part of lead arsenate or calcium arsenate (use sparingly if the potency is strong), one part of slaked lime powder, and one part of finely sieved fine soil powder thoroughly. In the morning, when the dew has not yet dried, use a dusting machine or the finest sieve to sprinkle the mixture thinly and evenly on the leaves. The ladybugs feeding on the leaves will be killed after two days and nights. However, it is important to note that these two chemicals are extremely toxic, and humans and animals should not ingest them. The storage containers should be sturdy and placed properly in a dry place to prevent moisture from causing them to lose their effectiveness. These two chemicals are stored in various farms and extension stations and can be used in coordination.

The above-mentioned prevention and control methods, whether by catching or poisoning, should mobilize and organize the masses in the affected areas to work together. Otherwise, if some people catch them and others do not, the pests will have the opportunity to move around, conduct guerrilla warfare, and hide, and large-scale results will not be achieved. This is a matter that should be paid close attention to.

    二十八星瓢虫（花媳妇）的防除法
    郭毅民
    （一）为害植物的严重
    二十八星瓢虫，又名伪瓢虫（俗名花媳妇、花姑娘、察南名土别蛋），是一种形似葫芦瓢的甲虫，赤褐色，鞘翅上有大小不同的二十八个黑色星点。是茄科植物的害虫，食害马铃薯（山药蛋）蕃茄（西红柿）茄子等植物的叶子，有时亦食害非茄科植物，如瓜类、豆类。在察哈尔省的马铃薯，每年受害损失达百分之二十至四十，是群众最感严重的问题。
   （二）生活史和习性
    此害虫一年发生二回，以成虫潜藏山根及墙隙或杂草中过冬，产卵于叶子背面，直立并列，产后五六天即化为幼虫（长圆形、黄色，身有黑色分枝刺毛），吃去叶肉而留叶脉和表皮，使叶成网状变褐色而枯死，如叶缺乏，则加害茎及果的皮部。幼虫脱几次皮后，约二十二天左右的工夫，即变为蛹（蛹略成圆形，黄色，被黑色条纹），不食不动，紧附在叶的背面，蛹过七天，即变成虫，成虫过十五日后，即又产卵。第一次成虫在四、五月出现，第二次在九、十月，为害最烈期在七、八月。
    （三）防除法
    １、捉成虫：动员妇女儿童，一齐动手捕捉，此虫一经振动即装死，短时间不动，很好抓、每日早晚它都不活泼，亦易捉拿。
    ２、捕幼虫、捉蛹及采卵，也很有效；再即秋后清理地边道旁的杂草，也能消灭它过冬的巢穴。
    ３、药剂毒杀法：花媳妇是咀嚼口的害虫，用砒酸铅或砒酸钙一份（药力强要酌量使用）熟石灰粉末一份，细罗筛过的细土粉一份，混合搅拌均匀后，在早晨露水未干的时候，用喷粉器或最细的罗子薄薄而均匀的撒布在叶上，经两昼夜后便可杀死就食的瓢虫。但要注意这两种药剂的毒力极烈，人畜不要入口，盛放器具要坚固，要妥善放置在干燥地方，以免潮湿失效，这两种药各农场、推广场都有贮存，可以联络使用。
    以上的防除法，不论捕捉和毒杀，都应动员与组织被害地区的群众，一齐动手作；不然，有的捉，有的不捉，使害虫有来往游击潜伏的机会，就不会收到大的效果，这是极应注意的一件事情。
