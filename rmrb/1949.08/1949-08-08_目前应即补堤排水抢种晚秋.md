Editorial: After criticizing the apathy, pessimism, and even irresponsible attitudes of some individuals towards flood prevention and disaster relief, it points out: Based on the experience of flood prevention in various places over the past month, the following work should be carried out immediately in various places:

First, immediately strengthen flood prevention and rescue work. All breaches must be blocked immediately, all dangerous works must be repeatedly surveyed, and all projects must be strictly inspected. Reinforce outer dikes and strengthen inner dikes; raise low dikes and widen narrow sections; repair substandard sections and complete unfinished projects as quickly as possible. Properly allocate flood prevention personnel and materials. Necessary rescue equipment and accumulated soil should be prepared near dangerous works to prevent dike breaches and seawall collapses. Currently, it is particularly important to concentrate efforts on urgently repairing major breaches and dangerous sections of major dikes and seawalls. In areas that may be attacked by autumn floods, or disaster-stricken areas that may be repeatedly attacked, it is necessary to strengthen flood prevention and rescue organizations, such as strengthening flood prevention committees, command posts, protection teams, patrol teams, hydrological stations, water level stations, etc. All localities should implement unified leadership, be responsible for different zones, and focus on the dikes and seawalls connecting counties and districts. It is necessary to combine leading cadres with the broad masses of the people, and combine scientific technology with mass experience; it is necessary to be highly vigilant, courageous, and responsible, and oppose complacency and pessimism. Local Party and government organs in areas along rivers and lakes and in disaster-stricken areas must regard mobilizing the masses to control water and provide disaster relief as the overriding and urgent task at present.

Second, seize the time to drain water, save seedlings, and rush plant late autumn crops. According to the experience of various places, under normal circumstances, as long as the broad masses of the people can be mobilized to use all new and old drainage equipment and work around the clock, most of the crops, except for a few low-lying areas, can be rescued in time. During the rescue, drainage teams and drainage groups can be organized, drainage contracts can be signed, and mutual assistance can be provided between high and low fields. In dry land areas, a movement to dig drainage ditches can be launched to drain accumulated water. At present, wherever the original seedlings can be preserved and can have a certain harvest, the original seedlings should be preserved as much as possible, otherwise, late autumn crops should be planted quickly. After the water recedes and replanting is completed, special attention should be paid to weeding more; in higher areas, more fertilizer should be applied. Local governments should help solve various difficulties faced by the people in production as much as possible under the given conditions. Where both rescue and drainage and replanting need to be carried out urgently, manpower should be appropriately adjusted; the army should provide special assistance.

Third, provide urgent relief to disaster victims and carry out epidemic prevention. After the floods and typhoons, there are millions of disaster victims in East China who are crying out for food. Relief to these disaster victims has become the common responsibility of every person in East China. We must not only mobilize disaster victims to help themselves through production, but also vigorously launch social relief movements and provide assistance from the government so that disaster victims can not only overcome the current difficulties but also engage in production to alleviate the spring famine next year. While providing disaster relief, attention must be paid to the occurrence and spread of diseases after the disaster. Local governments and health authorities should work with non-governmental medical personnel to prevent them. In disaster relief work, on the one hand, we must oppose the bureaucratic attitude of indifference to disaster victims, and on the other hand, we must prevent the occurrence of over-left behaviors such as forced borrowing and eating from large households.

Fourth, in the water control and disaster relief movement, organize the masses to strictly prevent sabotage by bandits and special agents, and pay attention to discovering and uniting the activists among the masses to lay the foundation for new district organizations of peasant associations and people's self-defense forces. In areas where bandit activities are rampant, the people should be mobilized to organize self-defense armed forces, and a main force should be sent to various places to carry out bandit suppression work, so as to quickly eliminate bandits in various places.

The editorial concludes: All localities must educate cadres on the one hand and strictly enforce discipline on the other, so that every cadre of Party, government, military, and people's organizations in the currently affected areas and potentially affected areas understands: Wholeheartedly serving the people is currently mainly manifested in whether we can lead the people to fight against floods, a major issue related to the life and death of millions of people. This is a severe test facing Party and government organs in various places. We must strengthen our ties with the masses and consolidate and enhance the Party's prestige in this test. Any hesitation or concern is not allowed.

    目前应即补堤排水抢种晚秋
    社论在指责了个别人员对防汛救灾还存在麻痹和悲观失望的情绪甚至不负责任的态度后，指出：根据月来各地防汛的经验，目前各地应即进行以下工作：
    第一、立即加强防汛抢险工作。目前各处决口要立即堵塞，各处险工要进行反复勘察，各处工程要严格地检查。要抢修外堤，加强内堤；低圩加高，狭处补阔；不合格者补修，未完工者应迅速完成。要妥善支配防汛人员及防汛器材。险工附近要备有必需的抢险器材及积土，防止堤圩决口，海塘溃决。目前特别要集中力量紧急抢修主要决口与主要堤塘险工。凡是秋汛可能侵袭之处，或可能被重复侵袭的受灾地带，必须加强防汛抢险组织，如加强防汛委员会、指挥部、防护队、巡逻队、水文站、水位站等等。各地应实行统一领导，分区负责，并着重注意县与县，区与区联接处之堤圩。要做到领导干部与广大人民相结合，科学技术与群众经验相结合；要高度警惕，勇于负责，反对麻痹苟安或消极悲观心理。沿江、沿湖和被灾地区的地方党政机关，必须把动员群众治水救灾当作当前压倒一切的紧急任务。
    第二、抓紧时间排水，抢救禾苗，抢种晚秋。根据各地经验，在通常情形下，只要能动员广大人民利用一切新旧排水器具，日夜抓紧抢救，则除少数过洼之地以外，绝大部分都可及时获救。抢救时，可组织排水队、排水小组，订排水合同，高低田互助等办法。在旱田地区，则可发动挖水沟运动，排泄积水。目前凡是原苗能保存并能有一定收成之处，应尽量保存原苗，否则应迅速抢种晚秋。水退及补种以后，要特别注意多锄草；较高之地，并应注意多施肥。对于人民在生产上的各种困难，各地政府要在可能条件下尽量帮助解决。在抢险及排水抢救抢种二者都需要紧急进行之处，则要适当调剂人力；军队要特别给予协助。
    第三、要急赈灾民及进行防疫。在水灾及台风以后，华东各地嗷嗷待哺的灾民有数百万。对这些灾民的救济，已成为华东每一个人民的共同责任。我们既要发动灾民生产自救，又要大力展开社会救济运动，及由政府加以援助，使灾民不仅能渡过当前的难关，而且能进行生产，以减轻明年的春荒。与救灾同时，必须注意灾后疾病的发生与流行。各地政府及卫生机关要协同民间医疗人员等妥为防止。在救灾工作中，一面要反对对灾民漠不关心的官僚主义态度，一面又要防止强迫硬借、吃大户等过左的行为发生。
    第四、要在治水救灾运动中组织群众严防匪特破坏，并注意发现和团结群众中的积极分子，打下新区组织农民协会与人民自卫队的基础。在土匪活动猖獗地区，要发动人民组织自卫武装，并应以主力一部到各地进行剿匪工作，务期将各地土匪迅速肃清。
    社论最后指出：各地要一面教育干部，一面严申纪律，使目前受灾地区及可能受灾地区的党政军和人民团体的每一个干部明白：全心全意为人民服务，目前主要的表现在我们是否能领导人民与洪水作斗争这一关系千百万人民生死存亡的重大问题上。这是我各地党政机关面临着的严重考验。我们必须在这个考验中加强与群众的联系，巩固与提高党的威信，任何犹豫顾虑都是不允许的。
