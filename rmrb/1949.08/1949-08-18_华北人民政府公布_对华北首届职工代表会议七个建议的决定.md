　　North China People's Government Announcement
  　Decision of the North China People's Government on Seven Proposals from the First North China Workers' Representative Conference
    [Ping City News] On August 10th, the North China People's Government announced its decisions on the following seven matters from the First North China Workers' Representative Conference: "Resolution on Establishing Supply Stores and Consumer Cooperatives to Guarantee the Livelihood of Workers," "Decision on Establishing Factory Management Committees and Factory Workers' Representative Conferences in State-Owned and Public Factories and Enterprises," "Proposal on Organizing an Industrial Reconversion Committee to be Responsible for Planning Industrial Reconversion," "Proposal on Establishing Labor Bureaus in Various Provinces and Cities," "Proposal on Dividing Major Industrial and Mining Areas in North China into Industrial Zones and Establishing Unified Political Power," "Proposal on Restoring and Establishing Schools in Workers' Areas," and "Proposal on the Issue of Income Tax on Wages."
    I. Decision on the Resolution on Establishing Supply Stores and Consumer Cooperatives to Guarantee the Livelihood of Workers
    After studying the "Resolution on Establishing Supply Stores and Consumer Cooperatives to Guarantee the Livelihood of Workers" from the First North China Workers' Representative Conference, the Government, in principle, agrees with the various suggestions made to the Government in the resolution, considering it an effective way to guarantee the livelihood of workers. To this end, the following resolutions are made:
    (1) A dedicated wage management agency shall be established under the leadership of the North China Financial and Economic Committee. Provincial and municipal governments may also establish wage management agencies as needed.
    (2) The Ministry of Industry and Commerce shall immediately (instruct its affiliated trade departments) begin studying the organization of supply stores under necessary and possible conditions, and carry out the distribution of daily necessities for workers. During implementation, it may consult with the General Labor Union to select certain areas and factories for pilot projects, gain experience, and gradually expand.
    (3) The competent authorities of each factory and enterprise should help the workers' unions of each factory organize workers' consumer cooperatives. Especially before the supply stores are established, the workers' consumer cooperatives of each factory should assume certain responsibilities for the supply of workers' daily necessities as much as possible. All legitimate workers' cooperatives are allowed to be exempt from business income tax. However, those who engage in other commercial activities outside the scope of the cooperative's business under the guise of a workers' cooperative should be banned.
    II. Decision on Establishing Factory Management Committees and Factory Workers' Representative Conferences in State-Owned and Public Enterprises
    After studying the "Implementation Regulations on Establishing Factory Management Committees and Factory Workers' Representative Conferences in State-Owned and Public Enterprises" proposed by the First North China Workers' Representative Conference, the North China People's Government Committee believes that the principle of this proposal lies in implementing democratic factory management, enhancing the sense of ownership of the enterprise among workers, promoting the enthusiasm and creativity of workers in factories and enterprises, and consciously and voluntarily improving operations, increasing production, and cultivating workers' ability to manage production in an organized and disciplined manner, in order to achieve the goal of running people's enterprises well by relying on all workers. This not only demonstrates the concern and care of worker representatives and workers in state-owned and public factories and enterprises for the people's enterprises, but also represents the correct criticism of past management work in state-owned and public factories and enterprises by worker representatives in the capacity of owners. This kind of proactive and responsible proposal is necessary for developing production and carrying out economic construction. After careful study, the Government fully agrees with this proposal and decides to announce that these regulations will be implemented immediately in state-owned and public factories and enterprises (regulations attached). During implementation, research and discussions should be carried out among the workers with preparation, steps, and plans, and specific implementation measures in each factory and enterprise should be formulated according to the different conditions of each factory and enterprise. Experiences in implementation should be summarized and reported to the Government at any time.
    Attachment: One copy of the Implementation Regulations.
    Implementation Regulations on Establishing Factory Management Committees and Factory Workers' Representative Conferences in State-Owned and Public Factories and Enterprises

    Chapter III Powers of the Management Committee and Powers of the Factory Director
    Article 6 The Management Committee is the unified leading administrative organization in factories and enterprises under the leadership of the superior factory and enterprise management authority. The task of the Management Committee is to discuss and decide on all major issues related to production and management, such as production plans, business operations, management systems, production organization, personnel appointments and removals, and wage and welfare issues, in accordance with the production plans and various instructions stipulated by the superior enterprise leadership authority, combined with the actual situation of the factory, and to regularly inspect and summarize work.
    Article 7 The Management Committee is chaired by the factory director (or manager). The resolutions of the Management Committee shall be promulgated and implemented by order of the factory director (or manager). The leadership of the superior Management Committee over the lower-level (branch factory, etc.) Management Committee shall be carried out by the factory director (or manager) through instructions.
    Article 8 If the factory director (or manager) believes that the resolution passed by the majority of the Management Committee members conflicts with the interests of the factory or is inconsistent with the instructions of the superior authority, the manager or factory director has the power to suspend its implementation. However, he must immediately report to the superior authority for instructions.
    Article 9 If the majority of the Management Committee members believe that the factory director's (or manager's) measures in the preceding article are unsuitable, or have objections to his report, they may also report their opinions to the superior authority at the same time and request instructions together. However, before instructions are received from the superior authority, the decision of the factory director (or manager) should be implemented.
    Article 10 In the event of an emergency that cannot wait for the Management Committee to meet, the factory director (or manager) has the power to handle it. However, he must report the matter to the Management Committee afterward and request ratification.
    Chapter IV Standing Committee of the Management Committee
    Article 11 In large factories and enterprises, in order to facilitate the implementation of the Management Committee's resolutions and promptly supervise and inspect work, a Standing Committee of the Management Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Standing Committee) may be formed by the factory director, the chairman of the labor union, and one member elected by the Management Committee. The factory director (or manager) shall be the ex officio chairman, and under the spirit of the Management Committee's resolutions, they shall consult and handle all relatively important daily work related to production, management, personnel, wages, welfare, etc.
    Article 12 The Standing Committee must frequently discuss issues so that all the problems and solutions that occur in the factory are known to each member of the Standing Committee, and they can coordinate with each other to carry out the work of handling the solutions.
    Article 13 During the period of military control in factories and enterprises in newly liberated areas, the resident military representative should be an ex officio member of the Management Committee and the Standing Committee.
    Chapter V Organization of Factory Workers' Representative Conference
    Article 14 All state-owned and public factories with more than two hundred workers and staff must organize a Factory Workers' Representative Conference. In factories with fewer than two hundred people, a representative conference will not be established, but a meeting of all workers in the factory must be convened once or twice a month, convened by the chairman of the labor union.
    Article 15 The representatives of the Factory Workers' Representative Conference should be elected with each grassroots organization (such as production teams or production shifts) in each production department as a unit. Each representative is directly responsible to the workers he represents.
    Article 16 The representatives of the Factory Workers' Representative Conference are re-elected every year. However, if the workers they represent believe that the representative is incompetent, they may be replaced and re-elected at any time. They may be re-elected for successive terms.

    Article 18 In large factories and enterprises with a large number of workers, if there are branch factories (or offices or departments, etc.) under the general factory, the representative conference can be divided into two levels. The representatives of the general factory representative conference can be elected by the branch factory representative conference, but they can also be directly elected by the workers.
    Chapter VI Powers of the Factory Workers' Representative Conference
    Article 19 The Factory Workers' Representative Conference has the power to listen to and discuss the reports of the Management Committee, inspect the Management Committee's operation and management of the factory and its leadership style, and criticize and make suggestions to the Management Committee.
    Article 20 All resolutions of the Factory Workers' Representative Conference on the administration of the factory and enterprise must be approved by the Management Committee and become effective after being promulgated by the factory director by order.
    Article 21 The Factory Workers' Representative Conference is the representative conference of the factory's labor union organization. The factory labor union committee has the obligation to fully implement all resolutions of the representative conference on labor union affairs. Without the decision of the superior labor union, the labor union committee may not change the resolutions of the representative conference. (⑴⑵)
    III. Decision on Establishing an Industrial Reconversion Committee
    As North China has been completely liberated, the state-owned and public factories in the old areas, due to inconvenient transportation, high costs, outdated machinery, and the cessation of certain military manufacturing, are bound to need to downsize their organizations or convert to peacetime production. The workers in these factories have mostly supported the long-term revolutionary war, sharing joys and hardships, and have made outstanding contributions. The government should be responsible for carefully handling the issue of re-employment and career changes for these surplus workers. To carry out this serious political task, the Government agrees to establish an "Industrial Reconversion Committee."
    The Industrial Reconversion Committee should be under the leadership of the Financial and Economic Committee, with the enterprise department and the Labor Bureau as the main bodies, and should absorb representatives from the labor union and other relevant departments. Its work should focus on formulating policies and methods and seeking ways for the surplus workers to find employment and change careers.
    The Government agrees with the following four principles proposed by the First North China Workers' Representative Conference: (1) Gradually convert factories manufacturing military supplies into factories manufacturing daily necessities, such as converting to manufacturing railway and agricultural machinery; (2) Find ways for workers to change careers, while maintaining their original wages during the period of learning new technologies, generally limited to six months; (3) Open worker schools so that workers who are willing to learn can enroll in school and receive partial wages to maintain their family life; (4) Workers who have been in the factory for a short time and are willing to return home will be given a certain amount of severance pay and a military service certificate based on the length of their service. Formulating specific implementation measures based on the above principles should be the primary task of the Industrial Reconversion Committee.
    Before the above specific measures are formulated, factories should not begin to lay off workers for the time being. If there are any that must be handled, they should consult with the labor union of the factory or its superior labor union to formulate appropriate measures for handling them.
    IV. Decision on Establishing Provincial and Municipal Labor Bureaus
    In order to further implement labor-capital policies and strengthen labor protection, the Government agrees with the suggestion of the First North China Workers' Representative Conference to establish provincial and municipal labor bureaus. It is stipulated as follows:
    1. Each provincial people's government and municipal people's government directly under the Government shall establish a labor bureau as one of the constituent parts of the government.
    2. The provincial and municipal labor bureaus shall be responsible for the following matters:
    (1) Research and guidance on worker welfare and worker education;
    (2) Review of internal management rules of state-owned, public, joint-venture, and private enterprises;
    (3) Review of labor contracts and labor agreements;
    (4) Resolution of labor-capital disputes in private enterprises;
    (5) Guidance on the planning, management, and distribution of labor insurance funds;
    (6) Supervision and inspection of safety and hygiene equipment in mines and factories;
    (7) Registration of worker organizations;
    (8) Other research on labor policies.
    3. The specific staffing of provincial and municipal labor bureaus shall be determined by the provincial and municipal people's governments based on the workload.
    4. A labor bureau may be established in a city under the jurisdiction of a province, subject to the approval of the provincial people's government and implementation by this Government.
    5. The county people's government in counties with a large number of general industries may establish a labor section with the approval of the provincial people's government, or add full-time cadres to the civil affairs section to be responsible for its work.
    V. Decision on Administrative Division and Establishment of Administrative Institutions in Major Industrial and Mining Areas in North China
    The Government agrees in principle with the suggestion of the First North China Workers' Representative Conference to divide major industrial and mining areas into industrial zones and establish corresponding political power institutions to unify the administrative leadership of the area, and makes the following specific decisions:
    1. Regulations on the division of industrial and mining areas:
    (1) With the approval of the North China or provincial people's government, a larger industrial and mining area may establish a mining area people's government equivalent to a county or district, with a chairman and vice chairman, under the leadership of the municipal people's government, special commissioner's office, or county people's government.
    (2) The enterprise organs and worker dormitories in general administrative areas may be divided into several streets (villages), and a street (village) people's government shall be elected by the workers and their families, under the administrative leadership of the district office.
    2. Administrative organization of industrial and mining areas: In addition to an appropriate reduction in accordance with the general county and district staffing, the mining area people's government may add a labor section or labor assistant, whose main responsibilities are to implement the matters in the "Decision of the North China People's Government on Establishing Provincial and Municipal Labor Bureaus and County Labor Sections."
    3. The main leaders of the mining area people's government shall be filled by cadres at the level of county head or district head. If necessary, they may be concurrently held by the deputy mayor, deputy special commissioner, or deputy county head.
    4. The main leaders of the industrial and mining area people's government may participate in the management committee and production planning committee of each industrial and mining enterprise department. When the people's government of each district holds a meeting, the director of the worker union of each enterprise must be invited to participate.
    5. The division of industrial and mining areas and the organizational staffing of the mining area people's government shall be drafted by the provincial and county people's governments in conjunction with the enterprise departments (with detailed maps attached) and submitted to the North China or provincial people's government for approval and promulgation.
    VI. Decision on Restoring and Establishing Schools in Workers' Areas
    The First North China Workers' Representative Conference raised the issue of "restoring and establishing schools in workers' areas." The Government believes that this is very necessary. In order to solve this problem step by step, effectively, and practically, in addition to the general provisions in the Interim Measures for Elementary Education, the following decisions are made based on the current actual needs and objective possibilities:
    (1) If the original primary and secondary schools in the workers' area have been closed down, the directly subordinate people's government shall order the relevant factories, mines, transportation and other organs to cooperate with the labor union to prepare for restoration as soon as possible under necessary and possible conditions. The people's government shall provide practical guidance and assistance to schools that are being restored or have been restored in accordance with the specific situation.
    (2) In workers' areas where schools have not been established, new primary schools should be planned and opened by the directly subordinate people's government in conjunction with the administrative authorities of factories, mines, transportation, etc., and the labor union, depending on needs and possibilities. In areas where workers, citizens, and farmers live together, where it is not necessary to set up primary schools for workers' children separately, general primary schools must pay special attention to admitting workers' children.
    (3) In large industrial cities or workers' areas, when conditions for establishing middle schools or vocational schools exclusively for the education of workers and their children are not available, general secondary schools should pay attention to admitting workers and their children. The administrative authorities of factories, mines, transportation, etc., should also be responsible and systematically send workers and their children to study in these schools.
    (4) Whether it is a restored or newly built school, necessary measures must be taken to exempt workers' children from tuition and miscellaneous fees, so that workers' children have the opportunity to enroll in school and study, and to correct the unreasonable phenomenon that most workers' children could not enroll in school in the past.
    (5) In all worker residential areas, the relevant people's government should cooperate with the labor union of the enterprise to open vocational spare-time schools to gradually improve the political, cultural, or technical level of the workers. The expenses of this school should be paid from the 1.5% of the education fund. The spare-time school must have a dedicated person in charge of leadership, and the teachers should be given a certain remuneration.
    (6) For the schools for the children of employees separately established by factories, mines, transportation and other enterprises, the daily administrative affairs can be led by the administrative authorities of the enterprise, and a school affairs management committee should be composed of representatives from the administration, the labor union, the parents of students, and the faculty and staff to be responsible for discussing and deciding on various major matters. As for the guiding principles, school system, curriculum, teaching implementation, appointment and removal of principals and directors of teaching, and the employment of teachers, they must comply with the government's regulations on general schools and report the work to the directly subordinate people's government's special management agency on a regular basis.
    (7) For the employee training and the schools for the children of employees separately established by public enterprises, the expenses for the former shall be handled in accordance with paragraph 5, and the latter shall be included in the enterprise's operating expenses budget or paid from the welfare fund, which shall be determined by each enterprise itself. The standard for expenditure, in addition to the original schools, should be reasonably adjusted according to their habits, and can generally refer to the standards of schools of the same level in the area. As for the financing of the schools for the children of workers run by private enterprises, the enterprise's capitalists and the labor union shall negotiate and handle it. If there are difficulties, the people's government can be requested to provide appropriate assistance.
    (8) People's governments at all levels should immediately conduct research and discussion with relevant labor unions and enterprise units in accordance with this decision, formulate implementation plans, and report the budget estimates to this Government for review and record. Those that are paid from local education funds should also be included in the budget estimates for education funds in the second half of the year. Regarding the solution of the school building problem, each local government and relevant enterprise department should coordinate and solve it from public real estate without allocating additional funds.
    VII. Decision on the Issue of Income Tax on Wages
    Regarding the issue of income tax on wages, the collection has been temporarily suspended in various places due to inconsistent collection methods in the past. The Government fully agrees with the suggestion of the First North China Workers' Representative Conference that a unified income tax law for wages should be formulated and promulgated as soon as possible, so that the burden on workers is fair and reasonable.

    三、关于成立工业复员委员会的决定
    由于华北全部解放，老区之国营、公营工厂，以交通不便，成本过高，机器陈旧及若干军火制造停止等原因，势需紧缩机构或改为平时生产，各厂职工大都是支持长期革命战争，甘苦与共，功绩卓著，政府对这编余职工之转业就业问题，自应负责慎重处理。为执行此一严重的政治任务，本府同意成立“工业复员委员会”之组织。
    工业复员委员会应在财经委员会领导之下，以企业部门与劳动局为主，吸收工会代表及其他各有关部门参加，其工作以制定方针、办法、寻求编余职工就业转业之出路为主。
    本府同意华北第一届职工代表会议所提出之下列四项办法原则，即：（一）将制造军用品工厂，逐渐改为制造民用必需品工厂，如改制铁路与农业机械，（二）设法使工人转业，在学习新技术时期仍保持原有工资，一般以半年为限，（三）开办职工学校，使愿意学习的工人得入校学习并发给部分工资，以维持其家庭生活，（四）入厂时间不久及自愿回家者，则按厂龄长短发给一定的遣散费及军工服务证，根据以上原则拟成具体实施的办法，应为工业复员委员会的首要工作。
    在上项具体办法未拟定以前，各厂宜暂不开始编遣事宜，其有必须处理者，应与该厂该地之工会或其上级工会，会商拟具妥当办法办理之。
    四、关于建立省、市劳动局的决定
    为了进一步贯彻劳资政策，加强劳动保护。本府同意华北第一届职工代表会议关于建立省、市劳动局之建议。并规定如下：
    一、各省人民政府及本府直辖市人民政府均增设劳动局，为各该政府组成部分之一。
    二、省、市劳动局主管下列事项：
    （一）关于职工福利及职工教育事业之研究指导事项；

    （七）办理职工团体之登记备案事项；
    （八）其他有关劳动政策之调查研究事项。
    三、省、市劳动局具体编制暂由省、市人民政府视工作繁简自行确定之。
    四、省辖市得设劳动局，经省人民政府呈准本府施行。
    五、一般工业较多县份之县人民政府，得经省人民政府批准设劳动科，或于民政科内增设专职干部负责其工作。
    五、关于华北大工矿区行政区划与设立行政机构的决定
    本府原则同意华北第一届职工代表会议关于大工矿区划为工业区，设立相当的政权机构，统一该区行政领导的建议，并作如下具体决定：
    一、工矿区区划规定：
    （一）较大之工矿区经华北或省人民政府批准，得设立相当于县或区之矿区人民政府，设主席副主席，受市人民政府、专署或县人民政府领导。
    （二）在一般行政区内之企业机关与职工宿舍得划分若干街（村），由职工及其家属选举产生街（村）人民政府，受区公所之行政领导。
    二、工矿区行政组织：矿区人民政府除按一般县区编制酌量缩减外，得增设劳动科，或劳动助理员，其主管事项为执行“华北人民政府关于建立省、市劳动局，县劳动科的决定”中之事项。
    三、矿区人民政府之主要负责人由县长级或区长级干部充任，必要时得以副市长副专员或副县长兼任。
    四、工矿区人民政府之主要负责人，得参加各该工矿企业部门之管理委员会及生产计划委员会。各该区人民政府举行会议时，须邀请各该企业职工会主任参加。
    五、工矿区之区划，及矿区人民政府之组织编制，由省、县人民政府会同企业部门拟具意见（需附有详细地图）报经华北或省人民政府批准公布施行。
    六、关于恢复和建立工人区学校问题的决定
    华北第一届职工代表会议提出：“恢复和建立工人区内的学校”问题，本府认为这是很必要的。为了有步骤地切实有效地解决这一问题，除在小学教育暂行实施办法中已有一般规定外，特根据目前实际需要与客观可能情况作以下的决定：
    （一）凡工人区原有中小学校已经停办者，其直属上级人民政府应责成有关的厂、矿、交通等机关协同职工会在必需和可能的条件下尽速筹备恢复，其正在恢复或已行恢复之学校，人民政府应按照具体情况，即时予以切实的指导和帮助。
    （二）原来未设立学校的工人区，应视需要与可能，由其直属上级人民政府协同厂、矿、交通等行政当局及职工会筹划开办新的小学。在工人与市民或农民杂居的地区，不需要单独设置职工子女小学者，一般小学必须特别注意吸收职工子女入学。
    （三）大工业城市或工人区，在未具备单独设立专为教育职工及职工子女的中学或职业学校的条件时，一般中等学校均应注意吸收职工及职工子女入学，各厂、矿、交通等行政当局，亦应负责地并有计划地派送职工及其子女到此等学校学习。
    （四）无论恢复或新建的学校，都必须进行必要措施，免收工人子女之学费杂费，务使职工子女得有入学读书的机会，纠正过去多数工人子女不能入学的不合理现象。
    （五）在一切工人住区，该管人民政府应协同有关企业部门协助企业之职工会开办职工业余补习学校，以逐步提高工人的政治、文化或技术水平，此项学校经费应由规定百分之一·五的教育金内开支。补习学校须设专人负责领导，其任课教员应给以一定之报酬。
    （六）各厂、矿、交通等企业单独设立的职工子弟学校，日常行政事务，可由各该企业行政当局负责领导，并由行政、职工会、学生家长、教职员各方面代表与校长组成校务管理委员会，负责商讨决定各项重大事宜。至关于方针、学制、课程、教学实施，校长教导主任之任免调动，教员之聘请，均必须遵照政府对一般学校之规定办理，并须定期向直属上级人民政府专管机关作工作报告。
    （七）公营企业单独设立之职工补习及职工子弟学校，其经费前者按第五款办理，后者或列入各该企业之事业费预算内或由福利金开支，由各该企业自行决定，经费开支标准，除原有学校，依其习惯加以合理的调整外，一般可参照所在地区同级学校的标准。至私营企业所办之工人子弟学校经费之筹措，由该企业资方与职工会协商办理，有困难时，可请求人民政府予以适当之协助。
    （八）各级人民政府，应即根据本决定与有关职工会及企业单位，切实进行研讨，制定实施计划，连同经费概算报请本府审核备案。其属于由地方教育经费开支者，并应列入下半年教育经费概算，关于校舍问题的解决，由各地方政府与有关企业部门，就公共房产中自行调剂解决，不另拨经费。
    七、关于工薪所得税问题的决定
    关于工薪所得税问题，前因各地征收办法不一致，已令各地暂时停征。本府完全同意华北第一届职工代表会议的建议，须从速制定统一的工薪所得税税则，颁布施行，并使职工负担趋于公平合理。
