As of the morning of the 11th, a total of one hundred and ninety-eight people have registered. This includes various specialized talents in chemical engineering, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, textile, aviation mechanics, medicine, and other fields. On their registration forms, each person has indicated their willingness to go to Northeast China, North China, East China, and other places to engage in the construction of the new China. After a preliminary review of the qualifications and interests of the registrants, the association will report them to the government for reference at any time.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping Broadcasting Station] Nanjing, 15th: The New Nanjing Construction Research Association held its first meeting on the 13th, attended by more than thirty experts and professors. Professors Pan Shu and Zhu Kezhen spoke successively, believing that scientific workers should shoulder the construction tasks of the new era. As long as everyone learns the Chinese Communist Party's spirit of overcoming difficulties, the future of the new Nanjing's construction is bright. The meeting decided to divide into four groups: industry and mining, agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, transportation, and public health, to be responsible for studying various issues related to the construction of the new Nanjing.
