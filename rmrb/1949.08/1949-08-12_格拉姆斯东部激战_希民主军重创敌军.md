The Royalist-Fascist army is attacking democratic positions, but the situation has taken a serious turn for the enemy. In western Grammos, the Royalist-Fascist army suffered heavy casualties on the 3rd and 4th of the month, and no attacks were launched on the 6th. A small attack by the Fascist army on Agios Christoforos on the 7th was repelled.

On the 7th, in eastern Grammos, the enemy was driven out of all the positions they had previously occupied. At noon on the 7th, the Royalist-Fascists launched a fierce offensive, attempting to occupy Karna, but were forced to retreat under the mortar and machine gun fire of the Democratic Army. The communiqué continued, stating that units of the Democratic Army launched a counterattack and pursued the remnants of the enemy forces. On August 7th, the Democratic Army killed 327 enemy soldiers, wounded 876, and captured 16. The communiqué quoted prisoners of war as saying that after the attacks, many enemy companies had only five or even fewer men remaining. The enemy command has requested the dispatch of additional gendarmerie units to the Grammos front to supervise the battle and prevent the demoralization of their troops.

    格拉姆斯东部激战
    希民主军重创敌军
    【新华社北平十一日电】塔斯社布拉格九日电引电通社报道：希腊民主军最高司令部八月八日发表公报称，格拉姆斯东部激战在继续中。保皇法西斯军正在攻击民主阵地，但形势已对敌人起了严重的转变。在格拉姆斯西部，保皇法西斯军于三、四两日遭受了重大伤亡，六日未发动攻击。七日法西斯军对阿基奥斯·克里斯托佛罗斯的一次小攻击已被击退。
    七日，在格拉姆斯东部，敌人被逐出其以前所占取的一切阵地。七日中午，保皇法西斯发动猛烈的进攻，企图占领卡尔那，但在民主军的迫击炮和机枪的炮火下，被迫退却。该公报继称，民主军所部举行反击，并追击敌军残部。民主军在八月七日共毙敌军三百二十七名，伤八百七十六名，被俘十六名。该公报引战俘供称，在攻击之后，敌军许多连队中只剩下五人甚至不到五人。敌军司令部要求增派宪兵队若干赴格拉姆斯前线督战，以防止他们军队的士气沮丧。
