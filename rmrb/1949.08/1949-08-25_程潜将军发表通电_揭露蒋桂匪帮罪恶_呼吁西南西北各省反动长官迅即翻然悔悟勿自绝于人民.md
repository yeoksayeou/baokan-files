Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, August 24th: General Cheng Qian's telegram of August 5th and Chairman Mao's and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's reply telegram of the 16th have already been reported by this agency. We have now also received several documents published by General Cheng Qian on August 1st and 4th, in which the exposure of the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek and Gui reactionary cliques is quite extensive. General Cheng's telegram of August 1st, in addition to being addressed to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, was mainly addressed to the Guangzhou pseudo-government and the reactionary senior officials and pseudo-parliaments of various provinces in the remaining Kuomintang-controlled areas. The telegram stated: "Chiang Kai-shek has been in power for more than twenty years, abandoning the teachings of the late Premier, seeking only to seize power, benefit himself, and promote his relatives and cronies. Corruption and bribery have become rampant, and false accusations are prevalent throughout the country, leading to the silencing of upright people and the court being filled with villains, and politics and the economy have deteriorated daily. He does not hesitate to perish with the nation, and there is no word of self-reproach. Judging by his actions, there is not a single thing that does not run counter to the Three Principles of the People. The people of the whole country have been under long-term oppression, and after eight years of war, the nation's vitality has been exhausted. The Chinese Communist Party, in response to the demands of the people, rose up to resist the war. Yet he still did not know how to examine himself and work together to salvage the situation, but instead relied on military force, borrowed foreign aid, covered up his mistakes, and stubbornly persisted in his evil ways. Several million elite troops collapsed in an instant. If he had not been abandoned by the people, how could he have been defeated so quickly? Mr. Li Zongren, acting as the head of the national government, rose up to advocate peace, and the whole country responded in unison. I, Qian, in accordance with public opinion, wholeheartedly agreed. The Executive Yuan solicited the opinions of various provinces on the CCP's peace terms, and I immediately replied, advocating full acceptance. However, after the representatives negotiated, without consulting the agreement of the various provinces, they hastily reacted against it, indulging only in personal feelings and disregarding the interests of the people of the whole country. Within ten days, the capital fell, the teachers and students were defeated, and the measures were incompetent, unprecedented in ancient times. They still intend to be trapped in a corner and indulge in oppressing the people. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? During the War of Resistance, Hunan Province bore the heaviest burden and suffered the most severe destruction. Years of severe floods caused great suffering, and there was no time to save the dying. My appeals went unheeded, and I had no way to maintain the situation, and I have been physically and mentally exhausted for several months. Recently, the Communist army went south, and the Gui faction troops retreated without fighting, gathering in all of Hunan. The people are trapped in exactions and are all thinking of saving themselves. I, Qian, surviving the hardships of war, and holding provincial administration in vain, how can I bear to sit idly by and watch the local area suffer disasters and remain silent for a long time. Therefore, I am acting on behalf of the elders and cleansing my fellow soldiers, expressing the desires of everyone's heart, and presenting them to the patriotic people of the world. I hope that the wise and virtuous officials in power will consider the dangers and immediately resolve their prejudices and continue peace talks, so that the national security can be restored immediately. If those in power today still have a trace of conscience left, they should be able to repent and immediately bring about peace and harmony. The people of Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces seek peace and hate chaos, and they share the same psychology. I urge you to unite and shout loudly to eliminate this catastrophe, and be careful not to be misled by reactionary propaganda again, and willingly cut yourselves off from the path of peace and happiness. I sincerely tell my comrades.
    Cheng Qian, August 1st."

　　程潜将军发表通电
  　揭露蒋桂匪帮罪恶
    呼吁西南西北各省反动长官迅即翻然悔悟勿自绝于人民
    【新华社北平二十四日电】程潜将军八月五日通电及毛主席朱总司令十六日复电本社前已报导。现又收到程潜将军八月一日及四日发表的几个文件，其中对于蒋桂反动派的罪恶揭露颇多。程氏八月一日通电，除给毛主席朱总司令外，主要是给广州伪政府及国民党残余统治区各省反动长官及伪参议会的。该电略称：“蒋介石当国二十余年，背弃总理遗教，惟务独揽大权，专己自利，姻亲私昵。贪黩成风，罗织飞＠，遍于全国。以致正人结舌，宵小盈庭，政治经济，日趋窳败。不惜偕亡之怨，初无罪己之辞。迹其所为，盖无一事不与三民主义背道而驰。全国人民处于长期压迫之下，复经八年抗战，国家元气剥削无遗。中共应民众之要求，起而抗战。彼犹不知自为检讨，共图挽救，复凭恃武力，假借外援，饰非作伪，徇私怙恶。数百万精锐之师，一旦崩溃。苟非见弃于民，何至败如此之速。李德邻先生代总国政，起而倡导和平，全国同声响应。潜依据民意，竭力赞同。行政院以中共和平条件征询各省意见，潜即复电主张全部接受。乃经代表磋谈之后，不征各省同意，遽予反动，惟逞私人意气，置全国人民利害于不顾。旬日之内，首都倾覆，师徒挠败，措置无能，古所未有。尚拟困守一隅，残民以逞，此而可忍，孰不可忍？湘省在抗战期间，负担最重，破坏最剧。连年水灾惨重，救死不遑。潜呼吁罔闻，维持无术，数月以来，神形交瘁。近顷共军南下，桂系军队复不战而退，麇集全湘。民众困于诛求，咸思自救。潜锋镝余生，忝持省政，岂忍坐视地方蒙祸，久安缄默。用是徇于父老，洁我袍泽，举人人心中之所欲言，以陈于当世爱国者之前。尚望当道仁贤，共念凶危，立即化除成见，继续和谈，则全国治安，固可立时恢复。如今之秉政者，苟犹有丝毫之天良未泯，当能翻然悔悟，立致祥和。粤桂川康滇黔甘宁青新各省人民求安厌乱，同此心理。务望一致奋呼，消此浩劫，慎毋再为反动宣传所误，甘自绝于和平康乐之途。谨掬至诚，告我同志。
    程潜　八月一日”
