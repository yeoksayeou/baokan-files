    Overcoming Guild Mentality and Strengthening Unity
    Carpet and Woolen Weaving Industry Workers' Congress
    Passed the Union Constitution, Elected the First Executive Committee, and Discussed the First Draft of the Collective Contract.
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to formally establish a trade union and discuss and prepare the drafting of a collective contract, the carpet and woolen weaving industry workers in this city held a city-wide workers' representative meeting for three evenings, starting on the 3rd. On the first day, the preparatory committee reported on the preparation process and carefully passed the constitution. At the meeting, Comrade Su Yifu, director of the Handicraft Work Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, spoke, focusing on the situation in which the guild mentality of some workers in the past had formed obstacles to worker unity. He emphasized that workers should strengthen unity and organizational strength, increase production, and demanded that workers attach importance to learning in order to improve their political, cultural, and technical levels. On the second day (the 4th), the association held elections for the first executive committee. Candidates were nominated by district, and each candidate was given a brief introduction by the nominator. After careful consideration, the representatives elected Wang Cang and eighteen others as executive committee members. Amidst warm applause, the elected members expressed their determination to serve everyone and asked everyone to offer more suggestions in the future. On the third day (the 5th), the meeting turned to a discussion of the draft collective contract. Representatives offered their opinions on the initial draft, and heated discussions lasted for three and a half hours. The three-day representative meeting concluded victoriously amidst cheers and slogans.
