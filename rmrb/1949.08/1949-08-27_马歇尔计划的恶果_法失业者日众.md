　　The Evil Consequences of the Marshall Plan
　　Increasing Unemployment in France
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th] TASS reports: As a result of the Marshall Plan, unemployment in France is becoming increasingly serious. In the Seine province alone, there are 120,000 unemployed, and in Paris, there are 90,000. Unemployment has spread to all walks of life. One-third of the workers in the aircraft industry, totaling more than 31,000, are unemployed, and Minister of National Defense Ramadier even said that he would reduce the number of workers in the aircraft industry by another two-fifths starting in 1950. One-quarter of the workers in the furniture industry, totaling 40,000, are unemployed, and one-half of the workers in the rubber and perfume industries are unemployed. The number of unemployed workers in the construction industry has increased sixfold compared to the beginning of 1947. In other industries such as shipbuilding, automobile, textile, and leather manufacturing, the number of unemployed is also increasing daily. In addition, there are tens of thousands of "partially" unemployed workers, some of whom work extremely short hours, and some only do temporary work. A delegation from the Paris "Unemployed Workers Committee" went to the city government on August 17 to petition, but was forcibly dispersed by the police.

　　马歇尔计划的恶果
  　法失业者日众
    【新华社北平二十六日电】塔斯社讯：由于马歇尔计划的结果，法国失业已日趋严重。仅赛纳省失业者即达十二万人，巴黎有九万人。失业已延及各行各业。飞机工业已有三分之一的工人，计三万一千余人失业，而国防部长拉马弟还说要从一九五○年起再减少飞机工业工人五分之二。家具工业有四分之一的工人计四万人失业，橡胶与香水工业有二分之一的工人失业，建筑工业失业工人已较一九四七年初增加六倍。在其他造船、汽车、纺织、制革等工业中，失业数目也日增。此外，还有千千万万的“部分”失业工人，他们有的工作时间极短，有的只做一些临时工。巴黎“失业者委员会”的代表团曾于八月十七日赴市政府请愿，但竟遭警察强行驱散。
