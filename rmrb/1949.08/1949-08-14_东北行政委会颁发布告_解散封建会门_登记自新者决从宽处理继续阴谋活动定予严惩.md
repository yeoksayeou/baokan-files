    The Northeast Administrative Committee, in order to protect the interests of the people and maintain social order, issued a proclamation on the 9th of this month, ordering all reactionary feudal secret societies and Taoist sects in the Northeast region to be dissolved immediately, and forbidding any further activities. It also stipulates that the principal culprits of the reactionary secret societies and Taoist sects should immediately report to the public security organs of various cities and counties to register and repent. Those who have genuinely complied with the government's orders and have already registered will be treated with leniency by the government; those who refuse to register or outwardly comply but secretly continue to engage in conspiracy activities will be severely punished upon discovery. Other people who have been coerced or lured into participating, regardless of the length of their participation, will not be pursued by the government as long as they withdraw from these organizations and cease their activities. The proclamation concludes by calling on all the people to heighten their vigilance and actively assist the government in carrying out this work.
