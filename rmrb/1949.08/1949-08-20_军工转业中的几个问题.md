Several Issues in the Conversion of Military Industries

By our reporter Shang Kai

The Chinese People's Liberation War is about to achieve nationwide victory, and peaceful construction is about to begin in full swing. The newly taken-over military industries, generally speaking, are no longer able to meet current needs, and rapid conversion has become an urgent task. Shifting from wartime production to production for peaceful construction is a relatively complex undertaking. Currently, regarding some of the problems encountered in the conversion of military factories in Beiping, a few suggestions are offered for reference in various regions:

(1) Preparatory work before conversion

Before converting military production, the direction should first be determined. What to convert to? What to manufacture? Based on the nature of production and the needs of future construction, military production is best converted to machine manufacturing. Due to the semi-colonial nature of Chinese society for the past century, China's machine manufacturing industry is extremely weak. Although there are some scattered machine factories, they are mostly still in the repair and assembly stage. In the future, in order to build a truly independent and self-reliant industrial system, this further increases the importance of machine manufacturing. The North China People's Government, based on the current situation in North China and the needs of construction, has determined the manufacturing policy for Beiping Machine Factory and Factory 70 for a period of time to come: mainly manufacturing transportation equipment and agricultural machinery to assist in the restoration and development of railway transportation and to solve the difficulties of cultivation and irrigation in rural areas.

Once the conversion policy has been determined, military production should be stopped immediately, otherwise it will cause large expenditures and waste, and prolong the conversion process. After the cessation of military production, on the one hand, a batch of temporary machine orders can be accepted immediately in order to reduce factory expenses during the conversion process, assist in the recovery and development of transportation and other industries, and provide workers with a conversion learning process to gradually embark on regular, planned manufacturing. Beiping Machine Factory, for example, recently accepted orders from the Ministry of Transport for water cranes, and from the China Textile Company for coal stackers and textile machine parts. On the other hand, the remaining military semi-finished products after the factories have stopped work can be concentrated in one place for completion. The First Branch of the Beiping Machine Factory is responsible for completing the tasks of various factories and is expected to complete all completion work in August.

(2) Cultivating new skills for employees

Manufacturing military supplies and manufacturing machines are two different types of production. Existing technical employees, having been engaged in military industry for many years, face an important issue of technical learning after converting to machine manufacturing. Currently, there is a shortage of skilled machine manufacturing workers. And, various regions are actively recruiting technical personnel to carry out recovery and construction. Attempting to abandon existing workers, being unwilling to patiently educate and transform them, and seeking another group of technical workers to manufacture machines is completely impossible. Therefore, solving the technical difficulties after conversion mainly relies on actively cultivating and improving existing workers based on their existing technical level, and transforming military workers into machine manufacturing workers within a certain period of time. At the same time, find a small number of skilled machine manufacturing technicians to serve as the backbone, leading the entire factory's workers to conduct production learning. According to the situation at Factory 70, the announcement of conversion caused some ideological fluctuations among the workers. Because the old technology could not be used and the new technology had not yet been learned, they were worried about unemployment and the impact on wages. This requires full ideological education and in-depth ideological mobilization, explaining that we are a revolutionary factory and should try our best to cultivate machine manufacturing talent from among existing workers, stabilize worker morale, and increase learning confidence. And, based on the specific situation, give workers a certain period of conversion learning time, stipulating that they learn the new technology within a certain period.

During the conversion learning process, on the one hand, reassign workers according to their technical strengths and weaknesses and capabilities, adopting the method of apprenticeships, conducting research and learning in actual work to achieve gradual improvement and enhancement. On the other hand, establish technical refresher courses in spare time, combined with political and cultural learning, to conduct planned cultivation.

(3) Reorganizing mechanical equipment

The original military factories in Beiping, except for Factory 70, which is relatively large and concentrated, are mostly scattered repair shops lacking large mechanical equipment. And these factories, during the three years of rule by the Kuomintang bandit gang, only used and did not build, stole equipment, embezzled funds, factory buildings collapsed, and machines rusted. This has also become a difficulty in today's conversion. On the existing basis, first make appropriate adjustments to the position of the machines according to the new work needs. Repair and rust the damaged and long-unused machines, and expand or rebuild various incomplete equipment. In addition, merge and appropriately concentrate some factories that are too scattered. The Beiping Machine Factory and its three branches, for example, were formed by the merger of more than a dozen units. Recently, a new sand casting factory and assembly factory are being built. Factory 70 is planning to use a two-shift system, day and night, to solve the difficulty of the lack of large machines.

(4) Transforming old institutions

In terms of production management, these factories still retain the bureaucratic institutions and bureaucratic styles left over from the Kuomintang era. Some factories have excessively large establishments, with some unnecessary and cumbersome systems that hinder production. For example, at Factory 70, obtaining a single material requires going through seven layers of procedures, coupled with the accumulation and delays of bureaucratic style, sometimes making it impossible to obtain the material from 7:00 a.m. until 11:00 a.m. Some factories are filled with retired Kuomintang puppet military and political personnel, without any systems, rules, or regulations. For example, before the conversion of the Beiping Machine Factory and its branches, it was impossible to statistically determine how much material was in the warehouse or how much labor and materials were used to make an item. In the future, to carry out regular production, it is necessary to reform this bureaucratic institution, eliminate this bureaucratic style, and make the necessary adjustments to personnel. Establish a factory management committee, implement democratic management, and, under the principle of stimulating production enthusiasm and improving production efficiency, based on the actual situation of the factory and with reference to the experience of various regions, everyone should jointly study and improve from actual work and gradually establish a reasonable organizational structure and scientific production system.

(5) Moving towards enterprise

Converting to machine manufacturing must implement enterprise management. In the past, military production did not need to seek out markets, did not care about high or low costs, and lacked reasonable management. In the future, it is necessary to emphasize changing management methods, strengthening management institutions, planning capital turnover, and accurately calculating costs.

At the same time, there must be a certain amount of capital, otherwise it will be impossible to turn around. Therefore, during the conversion period, all materials and assets should be cleared and valued to determine fixed assets, and then the government, according to the nature of the factory and production tasks, should make planned investments within its capacity to enable each factory to embark on planned production and achieve development. Currently, the factories in Beiping have begun to do this.

(6) Raw material procurement issues

Machine manufacturing requires a large amount of steel raw materials, but the factories do not have much material in stock and must rely on searching from various places. This requires cultivating a group of experienced procurement personnel with considerable political awareness and formulating a scientific procurement system. If the procurement system is unsound, it will affect the increase in costs and the waste of equipment. At the same time, in the procurement process, due to the lack of materials, there will inevitably be mutual competition to buy, which will easily stimulate price increases (this phenomenon has already occurred in Tianjin). This is a problem that deserves serious attention. Whether a joint procurement agency can be established to conduct reasonable control and regulation remains to be studied together.

(7) Cooperation with private factories

During the conversion period, and even for a long period after the conversion, the cooperative relationship with private iron factories is also very necessary. Because military production equipment is not entirely suitable for machine manufacturing, it often lacks equipment for a certain production process. Therefore, after accepting a batch of orders, a certain manufacturing process is divided out and handed over to private factories to complete together. For example, because the Beiping Machine Factory lacks a large sand casting factory, it hands over the sand casting project to private factories. Factory 70, due to the large-scale manufacturing of models, also outsources part of the models to private factories. This not only overcomes the weakness of the lack of its own technical personnel and incomplete equipment, but also supports the development and prosperity of the private machine manufacturing industry.

　　军工转业中的几个问题
    本报记者  商恺
    中国人民解放战争将要取得全国胜利，和平建设即将全面开始，新接管的军工工业，一般的已不能适应目前需要，迅速转业成了紧迫的任务。转战时生产为和平建设生产，是一件比较复杂的工作。目前，就北平各军工制造厂的转业中所遇到的一些问题，并提出几点意见，供各地参考：
    （一）转业前的准备工作
    军工生产转业前，应首先确定方向，转什么业？制造什么？根据生产性质与今后建设需要，军工生产最好转为机器制造。由于百年来中国社会半殖民地化的特点，中国机器制造业极端薄弱，虽有些零散的机器厂，也多是停留在修配阶段，今后为建设真正独立自主的一套工业体系，这就更增加了机器制造的重要性。华北人民政府，曾根据华北目前情况与建设需要，确定了北平机器厂、七十兵工厂今后一个时期内的制造方针：主要制造交通器材与农业机械，协助铁路交通之恢复发展，并解决农村耕作灌溉困难。
    转业方针既经确定之后，应立即停止军火生产，否则会造成大的开支与浪费，拖长了转业过程。军工生产停止后，一方面可立即接受一批临时机器订货，以便在转业过程中，减少工厂开支，协助交通与其他工业之恢复与发展，并给工人以转业学习过程，逐渐走上正规的有计划的制造。北平机器厂，最近即接受了交通部的水鹤，中纺公司的架煤机、纺织机零件等定货。另一方面，可将各厂停工后所剩存的军工半成品，集中一处，进行结束。北平机器厂第一分厂，即是担负了各厂的结束任务，并预期在八月份全部完成结束工作。
    （二）培养职工新的技术
    制造军火与制造机器是两种不同的生产，现有技术职工，因长年从事军工，转为机器制造后，技术学习是一个重要问题。在目前，机器制造技术工人缺乏，而各地又在积极招收技术人员进行恢复建设的情况下，企图抛开现有工人，不愿耐心教育改造，另寻找一批制造机器的技术工人，完全是不可能的；因此解决转业后的技术困难，主要依靠从现有工人的现有技术水平上，进行积极的培养与提高，在一定期间将军工工人变为机器制造工人。同时找少数熟练于机器制造的技术工人，做为骨干，带起全场工人进行生产学习。根据七十兵工厂的情况，宣布改业后，曾引起一些工人的思想波动，因旧的技术不能使用，新的技术尚未学会，担心失业和影响工资。这就需要进行充分的思想教育，和深入的思想动员，说明我们是革命的工厂，当尽量从现有工人中培养机器制造人材，稳定工人情绪，提高学习信心；并根据具体情况，给工人以一定的转业学习时间，规定在一定时期内学会新的技术。
    在转业学习过程中，一面根据工人技术优劣和能力强弱，重新编配，采用带徒弟的办法，在实际工作中，进行研究学习，以求得逐步的改进和提高。另一面，于业余成立技术补习班，结合政治文化学习，进行有计划的培养。
    （三）整理机械设备
    北平原有的军工工厂，除了七十兵工厂规模较大，比较集中外，其余都是一些七零八落的修械所，缺乏较大的机械设备。而这些厂子，在国民党匪帮三年统治期间，只使用不建设，盗卖器材，贪污资金，厂房倒塌，机器生锈，这也成了今天转业中的困难。在现有的基础上，首先根据新的工作需要对机器位置进行适当的调整。将坏的，及长期不用的机器，进行修配与擦锈，对不健全的各种设备，扩充或重建。另外对于一些过于零散的厂子，进行合并与适当的集中。北平机器厂及三个分厂，即是由十几个单位合并而成的。最近还正在建设新的翻砂厂与装配厂。七十兵工厂更计划用昼夜两班制解决大型机器缺少的困难。
    （四）改造旧机构
    在生产管理方面，这些厂子里，曾残存着国民党时期所遗留下来的官僚机构与官僚作风。有的厂是编制过大，存在着一些不必要的繁杂制度，妨碍生产，如七十兵工厂，领一种材料，要经过七层手续，再加上官僚主义作风的积压拖延，有时从早七点直到午前十一点尚领不出来。有的厂则为退休的国民党伪军政人员所充斥，无任何制度、规章和条例，如北平机器厂及所属各分厂转业前，仓库存有多少材料，做一件东西要用多少工料，均无法统计。今后进行正规生产，必须改革这种官僚机构，肃清这种官僚作风，将人事进行必要的调整。建立工厂管理委员会，实行民主管理，在刺激生产情绪，提高生产效率的原则下，根据本厂实际情况，参照各地经验，大家从实际工作中共同研究改进，逐渐建立起一种合理的组织机构，与科学的生产制度。
    （五）走向企业化
    改营机器制造业，必须实行企业化经营。在过去，军工生产不需要找寻市场，不计较成本高低，缺乏合理的经营。今后，必须强调改变经营方法，加强经营机构，计划资金周转，精确核算成本。
    同时，必须要有一定量的资金，否则将无法周转，因此在转业期间，应对全部资材进行清理估价，确定固定资金，然后再由政府根据工厂性质，生产任务，在可能范围内进行有计划的投资，以使各厂走上有计划的生产，并获得发展。目前北平各厂已开始这样进行。
    （六）原料采购问题
    机器制造，需用大批的钢铁原料，但各厂存料不多，必须仰仗从各地搜寻；这就需要培养一批有经验又具有相当政治觉悟的采购人员，并制订科学的采购制度。如采买制度不健全，将要影响成本的提高和器材的浪费。同时在采购过程中，因材料缺乏，势必形成互相抢购，这就很容易刺激价格的高涨（天津已有此种现象发生），这是一个值得严正注意的问题；是否可以建立一种联合采买机构，进行合理的掌握与调剂，尚待大家共同研究。
    （七）与私营工厂的配合
    在转业期间，甚至在转业后一个长时期内，和私营铁工厂的配合关系，也是十分必要的。因为军火生产设备并不完全适合机器制造，往往是缺乏某一生产过程的装备，所以接受一批定货后，分出某一制造过程，交私营工厂共同来完成。如北平机器厂因缺少大的翻砂厂，即将翻砂工程交与私营工厂去做。七十兵工厂，因大量制造模型，也将模型的一部分包给了私营工厂。这样既克服了本身技术人员缺乏与设备不全的弱点，同时也扶植了私营机器制造业的发展与繁荣。
