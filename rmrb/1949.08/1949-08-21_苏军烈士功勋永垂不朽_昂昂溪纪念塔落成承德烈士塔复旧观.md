Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 20th: The Monument to the Soviet Army Martyrs in Ang'angxi, built by the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government, solemnly held its completion ceremony on the fourth anniversary of "August 15th". More than 700 people from provincial and municipal organizations, groups, the Railway Bureau, and Soviet expatriates attended, bringing wreaths. Zhang Qilong, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Yu Yifu, Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, pointed out in their speeches at the completion ceremony that the Soviet Union is the most loyal friend of the Chinese people, not only giving the Chinese people great encouragement in spirit but also sacrificing their own lives to liberate the Chinese people. This is a concrete manifestation of the great spirit of internationalism. They called on everyone to further consolidate and develop Sino-Soviet friendship, step up production and construction, strengthen the power of the Chinese people, and ruthlessly strike at any imperialists who dare to recklessly attack the Chinese people. A representative of the Soviet expatriates said in his speech: "The martyrs sacrificed themselves for the sacred cause of communism and the liberation of all mankind. This is the glory of the Soviet state."

In other news: The Soviet Army Martyrs' Tower in Chengde City, Rehe Province, which was previously damaged by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, has also been repaired by the Summer Palace Administration and restored to its original appearance before "August 15th".
