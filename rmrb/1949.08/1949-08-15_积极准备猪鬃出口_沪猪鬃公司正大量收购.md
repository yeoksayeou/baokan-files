    Actively Preparing for Bristle Exports
    Shanghai Bristle Company Actively Purchases in Large Quantities
    [Shanghai News] The East China Foreign Trade Corporation, under which is the China Bristle Company, began purchasing pig bristles on the 3rd of this month. As pig bristles are one of China's major export commodities, but are currently temporarily unable to be sold abroad, the price has fallen by 10% compared to usual. The China Bristle Company's purchase is to take care of the interests of manufacturers on the one hand, and to actively prepare for the export trade that is about to begin on the other. It is reported that the current purchase price is 5.5 million yuan per dan for Shanghai No. 17 40% black bristles, and 7 million yuan per dan for Chongqing No. 27 black mixed bristles. Since the purchase began, in less than a week, a total of six batches have been contracted, with 125 dan of Shanghai bristles received. Hengcheng Company alone sold as many as 50 dan.

    积极准备猪鬃出口
    沪猪鬃公司正大量收购
    【上海讯】华东区国外贸易总公司，下设中国制鬃公司，自本月三日起，已开始收购猪鬃。按猪鬃为我国大量出口货之一，目前暂时无法外销，故较平常跌价百分之十。中国制鬃公司收购，一方面是照顾了厂商利益，另一方面则是为即将开展的出口贸易作积极准备。据悉：现订收购价格为上海十七号四十分黑鬃每关担五十五万元，重庆二十七号黑配鬃每关担七○万元。收购以来，未及一周，即先后共已订约成交六批，收进上海鬃一二五关担，恒成公司一家即卖出达五○关担之多。
