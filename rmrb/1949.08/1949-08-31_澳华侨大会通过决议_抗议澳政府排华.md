　　Australian Overseas Chinese Congress Passes Resolution
    Protesting Australian Government's Discrimination Against Chinese
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th】 TASS Sydney: The Australian government, adhering to a policy of racial discrimination, has once again deported a group of overseas Chinese on August 28th, despite numerous protests. The Sydney Overseas Chinese Congress has passed a resolution protesting this action. The Australian wives of the overseas Chinese facing deportation threats have decided to submit a petition to the United Nations Human Rights Commission, requesting that it stop this racial discrimination. Five leading Christian ministers in Sydney have also issued a joint statement protesting "the continued inhumane treatment of Asian people living among us and the persecution of their Australian wives and children." The statement further stated: Forced deportation is a serious blow to freedom. Destroying family life, separating husbands and wives, fathers and children, treating those forced to leave as criminals, and the extreme racism in all government actions are all violations of basic human rights.

　　澳华侨大会通过决议
    抗议澳政府排华
    【新华社北平三十日电】塔斯社悉尼讯：奉行种族歧视政策的澳大利亚政府，不顾许多抗议，而于八月二十八日再度驱逐一批华侨离境，悉尼华侨大会已通过决议，对此表示抗议。受离境威胁的华侨们的澳籍妻子们，决定向联合国人权委员会呈递申请书，要求制止这种种族歧视。悉尼五位首要基督教牧师亦发表联合声明，抗议“继续对于与我们共处的亚洲人民予以非人道的待遇和迫害他们的澳籍妻子和儿童”。该声明进一步称：强迫离境是对自由的严重打击。破坏家庭生活，使夫妻父子离散，把强迫离境者当犯人对待，以及政府全部行动中的极端种族主义，这一切都是违背基本人权的行为。
