Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th: A dispatch from the Polish News Agency in Warsaw states that, according to Minister of Internal Trade, Mr. Dietlik, Poland is confident of a good harvest this year due to favorable weather conditions in the first half of the year. The cultivated area has increased by 500,000 hectares compared to last year. The new grain warehouses will have the first large surplus storage since the war. The total amount of grain will not only meet the needs of the domestic market, but a portion of the surplus grain can be exported.

Regarding the Economic Committee's recent decision on grain prices and purchasing conditions, Mr. Dietlik stated that, as Deputy Prime Minister Minc pointed out, grain prices in capitalist countries have recently been declining. Before the war, this phenomenon of "cheap grain hurting farmers" often caused a drop in grain prices in Poland, resulting in disastrous consequences for the profitability of Polish agricultural production, especially severely impacting small and medium farmers. Now, thanks to the people's government in Poland, which is based on the worker-peasant alliance and implements a planned economy, farmers are still guaranteed good grain prices during the harvest season.

Now, in order to steadily increase grain not only in quantity but also to seek improvements in quality, the Economic Committee has decided to set different prices based on different quality standards of grain in order to take into account the interests of consumers. This is a necessary condition for reasonable transactions. Excellent grain will be used for human consumption, while inferior grain will mainly be used as livestock feed, thereby improving the quality of edible grain, flour, and bread.

The Economic Committee's decision (which establishes the principles for handling grain in the 1949-50 economic year) and certain orders from the Ministry of Internal Trade demonstrate the planning in grain production and trade, guaranteeing stable and fair prices for farmers, while protecting the market from manipulation by speculators.

    波兰丰收有把握
    满足国内需要尚可输出政府决定保证公平价格
    【新华社北平十四日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯，国内贸易部部长第特利克谈称：由于上半年有利的气候条件，波兰今年已有丰收把握。耕种面积较去年增加了五十万公顷。新谷物仓库将有战后第一次的大量剩余储存。谷物总额不仅将满足国内市场的需要，并有一部分剩余谷物可以输出。
    论及经济委员会最近对谷物的价格和购买条件的决定时，第特利克声称：正如副总理明兹所指出的，资本主义国家的谷物价格最近一直在下降。在战前，这种谷贱伤农现象经常引起波兰谷物价格的下降，从而对波兰农业生产的收益造成灾难性的后果，特别是对小农和中农打击最大。现在由于波兰有了以工农联盟为基础的人民政府，实行了有计划的经济，农民在丰收时仍旧被保证了良好的谷物价格。
    现在，为了使谷物不仅在数量上稳步增加，而且也求得质量上的改进，经济委员会决定按谷物不同的质量标准定出不同的价格，以照顾消费者的利益。这是合理的交易之必要条件。优良的谷物将作为人类食用，而较劣的主要作为牲畜饲料，这样来提高食用谷物、面粉和面包的质量。
    经济委员会的决定（它确定了一九四九——五○经济年度处理谷物的原则）以及国内贸易部的某些命令，证明了在谷物生产和贸易方面的计划性，保证了对农民的稳定而公平的价格，同时使市场免受投机商的操纵。
