	Reading and Working
	Niu Jiaxin
	Part One:
	A comrade, after graduating from North China People's Revolutionary University, came to see me before being assigned to a job, saying, "It's okay to go to work, but I won't be able to read properly." Another comrade, studying at North China University, wrote to me, telling me he wanted to "continue his studies for further education."
	It goes without saying that learning includes more than just reading; it also goes without saying that reading is a very important aspect of learning. Wanting to read well is not a bad idea for revolutionary youth, but is completely correct and necessary. Therefore, wanting to "read a good book" or wanting to "further one's education" is basically of positive significance. But under the condition that work urgently needs young people to participate, how can one read books well, and how can one "further one's education"? I would like to share some of my personal experiences here for readers to refer to.
	In my youth, I fantasized about having a study, shelves of books, and even slapped myself like Ah Q, vowing to "face the wall for ten years." I thought that only in this way could I read books well, could I "further my education," or truly have an "instant enlightenment" and open the floodgates of my wisdom. But in the end, I didn't do it, and it wasn't possible to do it. Because in such a great era, such a dramatically changing era, it is fundamentally impossible to fantasize about living an "ivory tower" life. Even if there were such a "yellow bamboo building" allowing you to "hold a volume of the Book of Changes and sit silently burning incense," reading like this, without combining it with reality and separating it from the practice of revolutionary work, would not make it possible to read books "well" or "further one's education."
	The ancients said, "In books, there are houses of gold," but it seems that not many people say that now. Others say, "Reading is for life." The former is naturally wrong, and the latter is purely for the "paradise" of the "little self." For example, saying "In books, there are houses of gold," isn't that for "life"? In fact, it is precisely for the "life" of "being a peasant in the morning and ascending to the Emperor's court in the evening"! So, if one says "Reading is for life," there is the question of "for what kind of life?"
	We are for life, and the life we are talking about should be for the masses of the people, for a progressive, free, democratic, and happy life. Or more specifically, our reading is to learn revolutionary knowledge, arm ourselves, so as to do revolutionary work better, and honestly serve the people. If we deviate from this point, and only want to "read a good book" or "further our education," that kind of thinking and saying is wrong. Chairman Mao told us: "To serve the people wholeheartedly, we must establish broad ties with the workers, peasants, and other people, and constantly pay attention to consolidating and expanding these ties." I think this should be our basic attitude and starting point for all issues, including the issue of reading.
	Therefore, abandoning current work, not being at ease with work, and only wanting to "read a good book," or already studying, still wanting to avoid work and "continue one's education," these are all wrong ideas; they even contain to some extent the transformed idea of "scholars being the first among the four classes of people," "the Emperor valuing heroes, and writing teaching you and the like, all are inferior except for reading," the "superior man" thinking of the imperial examination era.

    读书与工作
    牛稼辛
    之一：
    一个同志在华北人民革命大学毕业后，分发工作之前来看我，说：“工作倒是可以去工作，只是不能好好读书了。”又一个同志是在华北大学学习的，他来信告诉我，他想“继续读书深造”。
    学习不只包括读书一方面，这是不消说的；在学习中读书是很重要的一方面，这也不消说。好好读书，这对于革命青年不但不是什么坏想法，而且是完全正确完全必要的。所以，想“好好读点书”，或想“深造”，基本上都是有其积极的意义的。但在工作迫切需要着青年前去参加的条件之下，怎样才能把书读好，又怎样才能“深造”呢？我想在这里说一点自己个人的经验，供给读者参考。
    年青时代，我曾幻想过有一座书房，数架图书，甚至还象阿Ｑ似的打过自己的嘴巴，发誓要“面壁十年”。我以为惟有这样才能够把书读好，才能“深造”，或真的“一刻禅悟”，使自己的智慧开闸。但结果并没有做到，也没有可能做到。因为处在这样伟大的时代，这样变动异常剧烈的时代里，幻想过着“象牙之塔”的生活是根本不可能的。就即或有那么一座“黄岗竹楼”，容许你“手执周易一卷，焚香默坐”坐，而这样不结合实际，脱离革命工作实践行程的读书，也是没有可能把书读“好”或“深造”了的。
    古人说：“书中自有黄金屋”，大约现在这样说的人似乎不太多了。又有人说：“读书是为了生活”。前者自然不对，而后者也是单纯为了“小我”的“天堂”。比如说“书中自有黄金屋”，难道这就不是为了“生活”么？其实正是为了“朝为田舍郎，暮登天子堂”的“生活”！所以如说“读书是为了生活”，就有着“为了怎样的生活”的问题。
    我们是为了生活，我们所说的为生活应该是为人民大众的，进步的，自由的，民主的，幸福的生活。或者更具体的说，我们的读书，是为了学习革命知识，武装自己，以更好的做好革命工作，老老实实为人民服务。如果离开这一点，而只想“好好读点书”或“深造”，那种想法和说法就是不对的了。毛主席告诉我们说：“全心全意为人民服务，必须与工人群众、农民群众及其他人民建立广泛的联系，并经常注意巩固与扩大这种联系。”我想，这应当是我们对于一切问题包括读书问题的一个基本态度和出发点。
    所以，抛开当前的工作不作，与不安心工作，只想“好好读点书”，或已经在学习着，仍想回避工作“继续深造”，这都是错误的想法；其中甚至包含着某种程度的“士为四民之首”，“天子重英豪，文章教尔曹，万般皆下品，惟有读书高”那种科举时代的“人上人”的思想的变相。
