Guaranteeing Supply of Industrial Raw Materials
Northeast China Vigorously Develops Special Crops
Cotton and Hemp Planting Areas Exceed Plans
Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 11th – Northeast China has achieved significant success this year in restoring and developing special crops. Among these, industrial crops have been planted the most extensively. Cotton fields cover 1.3 million mu, exceeding the original 1 million mu cotton planting plan by 30 percent. It is estimated that this year's yield will be 20,000 tons of ginned cotton (i.e., pure cotton). Flax has been sown on 130,000 mu, also exceeding this year's plan, and is expected to produce 1,000 tons of pure flax, which will be supplied to state-owned textile factories for fine spinning and the manufacture of various linen products. Due to a shortage of seeds, kenaf has been sown on over 3,000 mu, and is expected to produce over 100 tons of hemp; if all of it is retained for seed, it can be extended to 40,000 mu next year. Fiber flax has been sown on 210,000 mu, and is expected to produce 10.5 million jin of pure flax. Jute has been sown on over 10,000 mu, and is expected to produce 1 million jin of pure hemp. Among these, kenaf and jute can be made into 500,000 to 600,000 gunny sacks. In terms of tussah silk, due to the limited availability of silkworm eggs, only 52 million trees were used for spring silkworms this year, but 120 million to 200 million trees can be used in the autumn. If we calculate based on 200 million trees, it can produce 1.5 billion to 2 billion cocoons, a six-fold to nine-fold increase compared to last year's output of 200 million cocoons. It is estimated that it can produce 300 to 500 tons of silk to supply the silk weaving industry. Other crops such as sugar beets and tobacco have also been planted more widely. Sugar beets are mainly grown in Songjiang Province, and after harvesting, they can produce 5,000 tons of sugar. Among commercial crops, fruit trees are the most important. In recent years, due to the devastation by the Kuomintang and poor management after liberation, the losses have been significant. This spring, the famous apples of southern Manchuria suffered from a serious mold disease, which was contained after the People's Government made great efforts to treat it. There are currently 4 million large and small apple trees, and it is estimated that they can produce 35,000 tons of apples.

    The achievements mentioned above are the result of the active leadership of the people's governments at all levels and the hard work of the peasant masses in overcoming difficulties. In particular, the farmers' difficulties with seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides have been resolved thanks to the strong support of the government. For example, in order to promote cotton planting, the government transported over 4 million jin of cotton seeds from eastern Hebei and lent them to farmers, and also issued 2,913 tons of cotton seed loans, and increased cotton purchase prices and issued 15,300 tons of grain in advance purchases to disaster areas. In order to restore tussah silk, yellow tobacco, apples and other crops, the government has issued a total of over 40 billion in loans, which has greatly encouraged farmers planting these special crops.

    Northeast China's cotton production has always been insufficient to meet the needs of the textile industry. Especially after Japan's surrender, the cotton-producing areas of southern Manchuria were occupied and destroyed by the Chiang bandit troops, and cotton production decreased significantly. Although the planting area has increased significantly this year compared to last year, it still cannot fully supply the needs of the textile industry. Hemp crops are also increasing with industrial development, but recovery is slow and supply cannot meet demand. The demand for consumables such as tobacco, sugar, and fruit is also gradually increasing as production develops and people's living standards improve. To this end, the Agricultural Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee has decided to massively develop cotton and hemp fiber crops in a planned manner next year, and appropriately develop and expand the planting of tobacco, sugar beets and fruit trees. This will gradually reduce the import of industrial raw materials such as cotton in foreign trade and increase the import of industrial equipment. Based on current actual needs and possible conditions, the tentative production targets for next year are: doubling cotton production, striving to plant 3 million mu; expanding hemp planting areas, including 350,000 mu of kenaf, 200,000 mu of jute, and 600,000 mu of fiber flax; restoring spring silkworm production to 120 million trees, and autumn silkworm production to 360 million trees; increasing tobacco to 80,000 to 100,000 mu; increasing sugar beets to 150,000 mu; and cultivating 2 million apple seedlings. The most important task at present is to prevent and control disasters such as diseases and insect pests, and ensure this year's harvest. In addition to issuing a large number of insecticides to the insect-affected areas of cotton fields in western Liaoning, the Agricultural Department has also lent more than 1,900 sprayers. The Liaoning Provincial Department of Agriculture has also organized a 250-person insect control team to work with cotton farmers to vigorously control the pests, and by mid-July, the pests had been completely eliminated. The cotton in various places is now growing very vigorously, which has not been seen in recent years. In order to further develop special crops in Northeast China in the future, the Agricultural Department is instructing its subordinates to pay attention to expanding quantity and improving quality, selecting and breeding improved varieties, formulating price policies to reward production, strengthening the management of special purchases and sales, and summarizing and promoting the experience of planting special crops.

### 保证供给工业原料  东北大量发展特种作物  棉花麻类种植面积均超过计划

    保证供给工业原料
    东北大量发展特种作物
    棉花麻类种植面积均超过计划
    【新华社沈阳十一日电】东北今年恢复和发展特种作物的工作已获得很大成绩。特种作物中以工业作物种植最多，计棉花有一百三十万亩，超过原订一百万亩种棉计划的百分之三十。估计今年能收皮棉（即净花）两万吨。亚麻播种十三万亩，也超过了今年的计划，可产净麻一千吨，将供国营纺织厂精纺，制造各种麻织品。洋麻因缺少种籽，播种三千余亩，可产麻一百余吨；如全部留种，则能推广种植四万亩。线麻播种二十一万亩，可产净麻一千零五十万斤。青麻播种一万余亩，可产一百万斤净麻。其中洋麻、青麻可制成麻袋五十万至六十万条。柞蚕方面，因限于蚕种不足，今年只放春蚕五千二百万棵树，秋季可放一亿二千万至二亿棵树，若以二亿棵树计算，可产茧十五亿至二十亿粒，较去年二亿粒的产量可增加六倍至九倍，估计可产丝三百至五百吨，供应丝织工业。其他如甜菜、烟草等种植亦较普遍，甜菜以松江省为主，收获后可制糖五千吨。商业作物中以果木为主，数年来由于遭受国民党的摧残及解放后经营不良，损失很大。南满著名的苹果，今春曾发生严重的霉烂病，后经人民政府大力救治，未继续蔓延。现共有大小苹果树四百万株，估计可产苹果三万五千吨。
    上述这些成绩的获得，是各级人民政府的积极领导和农民群众努力克服困难的结果。特别是由于政府的大力扶助，农民的种籽、肥料、农药等困难获得了解决。例如为着推广植棉，政府即从冀东运入棉籽四百余万斤贷给农民，另发放二千九百十三吨棉籽贷款，并提高棉花收购价格和发给灾区预购粮一万五千三百吨。为了恢复柞蚕、黄烟、苹果等作物，政府共发放了四百余亿贷款，大大鼓励了种植这些特种作物的农民。
    东北棉产向来不足供应纺织工业的需要。特别是日本投降后，南满产棉地区遭受蒋匪军的侵占和破坏，棉产降低很多。今年播种面积虽较去年大为增加，但仍不能完全供给纺织工业的需要。麻类作物也随工业发展而日益增加，但恢复很慢，供不应求。烟、糖、果产等消耗品，在生产日益发展、人民生活日益提高的情况下，需要也逐渐增加。为此，东北行政委员会农业部决定明年有计划地大量发展棉麻纤维作物，并适当地发展和扩大烟草、甜菜和果树的种植。这样可使对外贸易输入品中，工业原料如棉花等逐渐减少，而增加工业装备的输入。根据目前实际需要与可能的条件，暂定明年生产目标为：棉花增加一倍，争取播种三百万亩；扩大麻类种植面积，其中洋麻三十五万亩，青麻二十万亩，线麻六十万亩；春蚕恢复到一亿二千万棵树，秋蚕三亿六千万棵树；烟草增至八万亩至十万亩；甜菜增至十五万亩；培植苹果树苗二百万株。目前最重要的工作是防治病虫等灾害，保障今年的收成。农业部对辽西棉田虫害区，除已发放大批杀虫药剂外，并贷给喷雾器一千九百余台。辽西省农业厅并组织了二百五十人的防虫工作团，配合棉农大力防治，至七月中旬已将虫害消灭殆尽。现各地棉花都长得很旺，为近数年所未有。为了使今后东北的特种作物发展，农业部正指示所属注意扩大数量和提高质量，选择和繁殖良种，制定奖励生产的价格政策、加强特种购销管理工作，总结和推广种植特种作物的经验等。
