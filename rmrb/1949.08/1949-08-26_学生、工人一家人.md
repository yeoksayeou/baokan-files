　　Students and Workers Are One Family
    Tian Fang

    A month passed quickly. The workers of the 70th Ordnance Factory (participating in summer study) knew we were about to return to school, and they specially held a farewell party for us on the 13th.

    The friendship between the workers and us is based on the same outlook on life. This obviously cannot be measured by pure emotion. The young worker Zhang Deshan, who is skilled and active in production, used to think: as long as the technique is good, no matter where he goes, he can still make money and eat, regardless of politics! Therefore, he was indifferent to the New Democratic Youth League. Since we came to the factory, Jiang Jun has visited his home more than ten times, chatting with him and his parents, tutoring him in mathematics, and borrowing books for his sister to help her study. These visits often lasted until late at night. Jiang Jun's confidence in serving was increased by Zhang Deshan and his family's enthusiastic and frank attitude. He excitedly told me: "I have developed a great love for this work!" At the same time, Zhang Deshan applied to join the League. On the night he filled out the application form, I went with Jiang Jun to see him and asked him why he wanted to join the League. He said: "I admire Jiang Jun very much. I want to know why a member of the New Youth League is so enthusiastic about helping others!"

    Tian Guiguo is a middle-aged technician who has been an apprentice since he was a child and suffered oppression. His father was killed by the Japanese devils. People say he has a "bitter life," and he thinks so himself. One day he came to me very excitedly to chat. He used to envy the landlords and rich people, thinking that it was like seeds sown on fertile soil, growing very lushly, while he was like seeds falling on stones and not growing at all. Therefore, he believed in "fate"! He thought that the different situations of the rich and himself were "predestined." But he felt that now the landlords and rich people dare not show their faces, and the working people are the masters. The factory can also be suggested by the workers, and they can organize trade unions themselves. He firmly said: "I don't believe in 'fate' anymore! I, Lao Tian, can now walk on the street with my chest out!" Then he said: "Without the Communist Party, how could we have today? I will always follow the Communist Party!" From his words, I gained great courage and determination. I constantly reflect and fight against the inferiority of fragility and wavering!

    Separation is approaching, and everyone regards it as a major event. The workers started preparing the programs and equipment for the venue a few days ago. Needless to say, the 13th was even busier than usual. Busyness, tension, and excitement made everyone younger and more vivid. At the party, the worker representative Li Wenhua said emotionally: "Workers and students are really one family!" He also described the gains from studying for a month, saying: "I used to think that people were made by the old Buddha with mud pills. If you don't study 'labor creates the world', how can you know that it is superstition!"

    At 8:30, in the loud singing of "We are the masters of the new China", "The factory is our big family"... this very meaningful party ended. When the meeting was dismissed, many workers came again to shake hands with us warmly and told us to come again during the winter vacation. They said: "I guarantee that all the workers in the factory will sign up to participate at that time!" A young worker in the elementary class, who had missed a class, held my hand gently and heavily at this time and said: "I didn't study well!" We were very touched.

　　学生、工人一家人
    田芳
    一个月的时间很快地过去，七十兵工厂的工友们（参加暑期学习的）知道我们就要回学校，特地在十三号为我们开了一个送别性质的联欢晚会。
    工友和我们之间的友谊是基于相同的人生观的，这显然已经不能拿纯感情的眼光来衡量，青年工人张德山，技术很好，生产也积极，从前他以为：只要技术好，无论走到哪里，也照样可以卖钱吃饭，管他什么政治不政治！因此他对于新民主主义青年团是很淡漠的。自从我们到工厂以后，绛君曾先后到他家去访问过上十次，同他谈天，也同他父母谈天；替他补习数学，也替他妹妹借书帮助她学习，这种访问，往往要到深夜才散。绛君因张德山及其家属的热诚坦白态度而增加了服务的信心。他兴奋地告诉我：“我对这工作发生了极大的爱！”也就在这同时，张德山请求入团了，他填写入团表的当天晚上，我同绛君一道去看他，问他为什么愿意入团，他说：“我很羡慕绛君，我想为什么一个新青团的团员就这么热心地去帮助别人！”
    田桂国是一个从小当学徒，受压迫的中年技工，他底父亲是给日本鬼子杀死了的，人家说他“命苦”，他自己也这样想。有一天他很兴奋地来找我谈天，他以前很羡慕地主老财，以为那好比种子撒在肥土上，长的很丰秀，自己就好比种子掉在石头上长不出头，因此他是很相信“八字”的！以为老财和他的不同境况都是“命中注定”可是他觉得现在地主老财不敢出头了，劳动人民做了主人，工厂也可以由工人出主意，自己组织工会，他坚定地说：“我再不相信什么‘八字’不‘八字’了！我老田现在可以挺起胸膛在街上走了！”接着他说：“要没有共产党，咱们哪能有今天？我要永远跟着共产党走！”从他的谈话里，我得到了很大的勇气与坚定，我时时反省，和脆弱与动摇的劣根性作着斗争！
    分别快要到来，大家都看成一桩大事。工友们几天以前就在着手筹备节目和会场的用具，不消说，十三号那天更是忙碌异常。忙碌、紧张、兴奋使得每一个人都更年青生动多了。在联欢晚会上，工友代表李文华感动地说：“工人学生真是一家！”他又叙述了一月来学习的收获说：“从前我还以为人是由老佛爷用泥丸捏出来的，要不学习‘劳动创造世界’，怎能知道那是迷信！”
    八点半，在“我们是新中国的主人翁”、“工厂是我们的大家庭”……的响亮歌唱声中，结束了这一个极有意义的晚会。散会时，许多工友再一次的走来和我们热切地握手，嘱咐我们放了寒假再来。他们说：“我保证那时全厂工人都来报名参加！”初级班的一位青工，曾经缺过一次课，这时他握着我的手轻轻地沉重地说：“我没有好好学习！”我们非常感动。
