　　Shijiazhuang Public Security Bureau Relies on the Masses
　　Completes Production Protection Tasks
　　[Shijiazhuang Electric] The Shijiazhuang Public Security Bureau held a city-wide public security personnel "Red May" competition summary meeting on the 12th and awarded prizes. The main task of the Public Security Department's Red May competition was to cooperate with the city's great production competition movement and strengthen security work to ensure the smooth progress of the movement. During the two-month competition, they adhered to the working principle of relying on organization and combining with the masses and successfully completed their tasks. At the beginning of the competition, the police force was reorganized, ideological education and defense knowledge were strengthened, and the effectiveness of security work was improved. Secondly, the city's people's security forces were reorganized. This force was established on the basis of the original defense team. During the two-month competition, it played a significant role in assisting the police in patrolling, inspecting, and solving cases. It played a more active role in protecting roads, lines, and wheat in the suburbs, especially in protecting wheat, truly achieving the role of protecting production. The security work of organs, factories, and enterprises has also been strengthened with the active promotion of the public security departments. They assisted the public security departments in investigating and solving cases of special agents and saboteurs. For example, the Trade Company discovered the case of KMT member Zhang Wenjiang, and Huashi Company discovered the case of bad elements in the cigarette factory who were inciting discord and sabotaging the competition, totaling more than 11 cases of various sizes. Due to the combination of internal and external forces, the combination of open and secret methods, and the strengthening of reliance on organization and connection with the masses, the efficiency of solving cases in May and June was greatly improved. The ability to solve cases increased by 12 percent compared with March and April. This has stabilized social order and allowed the city's production competition to proceed safely. In addition, the promotion and improvement of the household registration system has also limited the opportunities for illegal elements to operate. Many household registration assistants collected social intelligence and reported the activities of bad people. For example, the case of the theft of the briefcase of a cadre from the Taiyuan Military Control Commission and the case of the theft of rice and flour from Yumin Company were both solved based on reports from household registration assistants. The above achievements are the result of the public security department personnel further contacting the masses, which has also increased the prestige of the public security personnel among the masses. At the same time, the administrative system has been gradually improved during the competition. For example, the social situation system, request for instructions and reports, duty, and work logs have been universally established from the Municipal Public Security Bureau to the various police stations.

　　石市公安局依靠群众
  　完成保卫生产任务
    【石家庄电】石家庄市公安局于十二日举行全市公安工作人员“红五月”竞赛总结大会，并举行给奖。公安部门的红五月竞赛，主要任务是配合全市大生产竞赛运动，加强保卫工作，使这个运动得以顺利进行。两个月的竞赛当中，他们本着依靠组织结合群众的工作方针，胜利地完成了任务。在竞赛开始，首先整顿了警察武装，加强思想教育和防卫知识，提高了保卫工作效能。其次整顿了本市人民治安武装，这个武装是在原有防护队基础上建立的。在两月竞赛中，协助警察巡逻、检查、破案起了不少作用。在市郊区护路、护线和护麦工作上，更发挥了积极作用，尤其在护麦工作上，真正达到保卫生产的作用。机关工厂和企业部门的保卫工作，在公安部门的积极推动下也加强了，他们协助公安部门，对特务、破坏分子进行了侦查破案。象贸易公司，发现蒋党分子张文江案，华实公司发现烟厂坏分子挑拨离间破坏竞赛案等大小十一起之多。由于内部外部的结合，公开和秘密的结合，依靠组织、联系群众的加强，使五六月份破案效能大为提高。破案能力比三四月份提高百分之十二。这样，就使得社会治安得到稳固，全市的生产竞赛得以安然进行。另外，户籍制度的推进和管理的改善也限制了不法分子活动的机会。不少户籍协助员搜集了社会情报，报告了坏人活动情形。如太原军管会干部皮包被盗案，裕民公司的米面被盗案，都是由户籍协助员报告破获的。以上这些成绩都是由于公安部门人员，进一步联系了群众所收到的效果，也因此而使公安人员在群众中的威信更加提高。同时在竞赛中行政制度也逐步健全起来。如社情制度。请示报告、值班、工作日志等，从市公安局到各派出所，均已普遍建立。
