    Organizing Production by Families of Martyrs, Military Personnel and Cadres
    New Clothing Factory Begins Operations
    [This City News] To resolve the livelihood issues of some families of martyrs, military personnel, and cadres, and to gradually shift the affiliated relief units towards self-sufficiency through production, the "New Clothing Factory" established by the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau officially commenced operations on August 1st. Located within the Women's Reformatory in Xidan Piku Hutong, the factory has over 180 sewing machines. Specially invited technicians organize families of martyrs, military personnel, cadres, and some workers to engage in production, serving various government agencies, military units, schools, and organizations. A retail outlet is also located on East Fourth South Street. Since the factory's opening, workers have been enthusiastically rushing to produce 20,000 sets of cotton military uniforms commissioned by the Logistics Department. They said, "We are making these for our own brothers, how can we be careless? Not only can we not cut corners, but we must also ensure timely delivery. The People's Liberation Army is fighting on the front lines, we cannot let comrades have any complaints." The factory can currently accommodate over 400 manual workers for tasks such as buttonholing, and these job opportunities will be given priority to families of martyrs, military personnel, and cadres recommended by district offices.

    组织烈军干属生产
    新建被服厂开工
    【本市讯】本市民政局为解决部分烈、军、干属生活问题，并逐步将所属各救济单位转向生产自给，所创立的“新建被服厂”，已于八月一日正式开工。该厂设在西单皮库胡同妇女教养所内，现有缝纫机一百八十多架，由特聘的技师组织烈、军、干属及一部工人进行生产，为各机关部队学校团体服务，并在东四南大街设有门市部。该厂开工以来，工人们正以高度积极性赶制后勤部定制的二万套棉军服。他们说：“现在是给自己的兄弟作活，那能马虎？不但不能偷工减料，还要作到准时交货。解放军在前方打仗，我们不能叫同志们有意见。”现在该厂尚可容纳担任锁扣等工作的手工工人四百余人，这个工作机会将尽先给予各区公所介绍之烈、军、干属。
