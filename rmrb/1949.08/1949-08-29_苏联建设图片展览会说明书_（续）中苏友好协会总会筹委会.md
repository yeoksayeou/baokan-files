　　V. Education
    The Soviet Union is the most educationally developed country in the world. Compulsory seven-year education has been implemented for urban children, and compulsory four-year education for rural children. Before the revolution in 1913, Tsarist Russia had only 91 universities with 112,000 students; now the Soviet Union has 800 universities with 730,000 students, which is more than the total number of university students in all European countries combined. There are 3,500 secondary schools with more than one million students. The number of primary schools is even greater, with more than 30 million primary school students. 270,000 young people studying in advanced night schools or correspondence schools enjoy the same rights as regular schools.
    Each Union Republic of the Soviet Union has its own national education and cultural institutions, as well as its own cultural workers. The Soviet system guarantees the full development of national cultures within the Soviet Union.
　　VI. Arts and Sciences
    After the establishment of the Soviet regime, knowledge and science were returned from the hands of the bourgeoisie to the masses of the people. Countless outstanding talents from worker and peasant backgrounds have become new intellectuals through the nurturing and care of the new society. They have made astonishing achievements in natural sciences, social sciences, and even literature and art. Before the revolution, Tsarist Russia had only 3,000 natural scientists. Now the number of natural scientists in the Soviet Union has exceeded 100,000, including 10,000 professors and doctors of science, and about 28,000 lecturers and masters of science. The brilliant inventions and achievements of Pavlov and Michurin in biology and horticulture are highly esteemed by the scientific community worldwide.
    The Soviet Academy of Sciences is the highest research institution of Soviet science. The current president is Academician Vavilov, and branches are established in various Union Republics.
　　VII. People's Material and Cultural Life
    In the Soviet Union, unemployment has been completely eliminated, which is in stark contrast to the increasing number of unemployed people in capitalist countries. This demonstrates the great superiority of socialism over capitalism.
    In the Soviet Union, the state allocates huge amounts of funds every year to improve the people's material and cultural living standards.
    In December 1947, in order to improve the people's livelihood, the Soviet government abolished the rationing system implemented during the Great Patriotic War and regularly reduced prices. At the same time, it supplied large quantities of various daily necessities. According to the post-war Five-Year Plan, in 1950, the output will be 260 million pieces of enamel and glazed utensils; 200,000 kettles; 160 million glasses; furniture worth 12 billion rubles; 450,000 sewing machines; 7.4 million clocks and watches; 1 million gramophones; 925,000 radios; 135,000 motorcycles; and 1.05 million bicycles.
    With the improvement of material life, the cultural life of the Soviet people is also improving. Many magnificent cultural palaces, clubs, public libraries, cultural parks, resort parks, cinemas and theaters have been built throughout the country. In Moscow alone, there are 21 cultural palaces, 152 workers' clubs, 2,300 libraries, and 60 museums. In the countryside, there are also nearly 100,000 clubs and reading rooms, more than 400 cultural palaces, and nearly 20,000 cinemas. In addition, the country also has nearly 600 well-equipped stadiums, 17,000 ordinary gymnasiums, 9,000 ski resorts, and 500 swimming stations.
　　VIII. Women
    In the Soviet Union, women have gained complete equality with men in economic and political rights, and have obtained opportunities to fully develop their talents and creativity. They have extensively participated in work in industry, agriculture, science, and culture, and have achieved brilliant successes. During the Great Patriotic War, they were inspired by the fervent feelings of Soviet patriotism, self-sacrificially operating in factories and on collective farms, helping the army and the state obtain all the necessary supplies to defeat the enemy.
    In the scientific field, tens of thousands of female scientists are engaged in work, of whom 259 have won Stalin Prizes for scientific discoveries and inventions, and 600 have obtained doctoral degrees.
    Women account for 43 percent of the total number of experts with higher education. There are 126,000 female doctors in the Soviet Union; about 800,000 female teachers; 291 female university professors; 2,615 lecturers; 15,000 collective farm chairwomen; 277 elected representatives to the Supreme Soviet; 1,730 elected representatives to the Soviets of the Union and Autonomous Republics; and 450,000 local Soviet representatives.
    In the Soviet Union, mothers are constantly cared for by the state. In 1947, the government spent 5.9 billion rubles on subsidies for mothers with many children. More than two million mothers with children have received national awards. More than 25,000 people have been awarded the title of "Mother Hero."

　　五、教育
    苏联是全世界上教育最发达的国家。城市儿童已实行了七年制的强迫教育，农村儿童实行了四年制的强迫教育。革命前一九一三年，沙皇俄罗斯只有九十一所高等学校，十一万二千大学生；现在苏联有八百所高等学校，其中学习的学生有七十三万名，即比欧洲各国大学生之总和还多。中等学校有三千五百所，学生有一百多万人。小学的数目更多，小学生有三千多万人。在高级夜校或函授学校里学习的青年，有二十七万人，他们享有和普通学校一样的权利。
    苏联各加盟共和国都有本民族自己的教育和文化机关，都有着自己的文化工作干部。苏维埃制度保证了苏联境内民族文化的充分发展。
　　六、艺术与科学
    在苏维埃政权建立以后，知识与科学，就从资产阶级的手中交还给人民大众了。无数工人农民出身的卓越的天才，都因新社会的培养爱护，成了新的知识分子。他们无论在自然科学上或社会科学上乃至文学艺术上，都有惊人的成就。革命前沙俄只有三千个自然科学工作者。现在苏联全国自然科学工作者的人数已超过十万人，其中有一万教授与科学博士，二万八千个左右讲师和科学硕士。巴夫洛夫和米邱林在生物学和园艺学上光芒万丈的发明和成就，更为全世界科学界所推崇。
    苏联科学院是苏联科学的最高研究机关，现任院长为瓦维洛夫院士，在各加盟共和国都设有分院。
　　七、人民的物质与文化生活
    在苏联，完全消灭了失业，这和资本主义国家失业人数的日益增长，成了一个很显明的对照。这说明了社会主义之大大地优于资本主义。
    在苏联，每年国家要拿出巨额款项，来提高人民的物质的和文化的生活水准。
    一九四七年十二月，苏联政府为了提高人民的生活，取消了卫国战争时期所实行的物品配给制度，并经常地减低物价。同时，大量供给各种日常用品。根据战后五年计划，一九五○年将出产搪磁和釉磁器具二亿六千万件；水火壶二十万只；玻璃杯一亿六千万只；家具值一百二十亿卢布；缝纫机四十五万部；钟表七百四十万只；留声机一百万只；收音机九十二万五千部；机器脚踏车十三万五千架；脚踏车一百零五万部。
    随着物质生活之改善，苏联人民的文化生活也日益提高。全国各地建设了很多堂皇富丽的文化宫、俱乐部、公共图书馆、文化公园、休养公园、电影院和戏院。仅仅在莫斯科一地，就有二十一个文化宫、一百五十二个职工俱乐部、二千三百个图书馆，和六十个博物馆。在农村里，也有近十万所的俱乐部和阅览室、四百所以上的文化宫、近二万所的电影院。此外，全国也有近六百个设备优良的运动场、一万七千个普通体育场、九千个滑雪场、和五百个游泳站。
　　八、妇女
    在苏联，妇女在经济上和政治上，获得了与男性完全平等的权利，获得了全面发展自己才能和创造力的机会。她们大量地参加了工业、农业、科学和文化等部门的工作，并获得了辉煌的成就。在卫国战争时期，她们被如火如荼的苏维埃爱国主义的感情所鼓舞，在工厂中，在集体农场上自我牺牲地操作，帮助军队和国家获得一切必需品来战胜敌人。
    在科学领域中，有几万个女科学家从事工作，其中有二百五十九人因科学的发现和发明获得了斯大林奖金，有六百人获得了博士学位。
    在受过高等教育的专家总数中，妇女要占百分之四十三，全苏联共有十二万六千女医师；约八十万女教师；二百九十一位大学女教授；二千六百十五位讲师；一万五千位集体农场主席；二百七十七位当选为最高苏维埃的代表；一千七百三十位当选为联盟及自治共和国苏维埃的代表；四十五万人为地方苏维埃代表。
    在苏联，母亲们受着国家的不断关切，政府在一九四七年支出津贴多子的母亲们的经费，达五十九亿卢布。有二百多万子女的母亲受到国家的奖励。获得“母亲英雄”美名的，有二万五千余人。
