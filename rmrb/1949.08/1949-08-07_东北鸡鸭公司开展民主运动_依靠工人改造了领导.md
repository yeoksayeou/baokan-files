    Northeast Chicken and Duck Company Launches Democratic Movement
    Relies on Workers to Transform Leadership
    [This Newspaper’s News] The state-owned Northeast Chicken and Duck Company in Harbin launched a democratic management movement in mid-July. The Party, government, and labor union cooperated to deeply mobilize the workers to criticize and review the serious bureaucracy of the leadership, educate cadres, improve work, and inspire workers' sense of ownership. Before the movement was launched, all parties made necessary preparations and brewed sentiment. Communist Party members in the factory first conducted self-criticism within the Party, profoundly recognizing the errors of past bureaucratic management based on the spirit of the Second Plenary Session. Party, government, and labor union cadres then went to the workers to conduct enlightenment education. To address the workers' various concerns, they used large lectures or had leading cadres conduct self-criticism of past mistakes to break down workers' ideological concerns such as fear that raising opinions would not work, fear of losing their jobs, and fear of being retaliated against, and to support the workers. At the same time, they used backbone elements among the workers to publicize and motivate everyone, explaining that raising opinions was for the purpose of improving work and helping the leadership. After such mobilization, the workers put forward most of their opinions, and their attitude was also very correct. They were all aimed at the shortcomings in production management, and put forward constructive opinions: how to reduce waste, prevent accidents, maintain and repair machines, and provide new production methods. This greatly educated the leading cadres, making them more aware of their mistakes and the need to humbly learn from the workers. After this movement, some unreasonable systems that had existed in the company for more than two years were thoroughly improved. Some practical issues related to workers' welfare, such as work clothes, straw hats, meals, and dormitories, have been resolved. The workers' sense of ownership and production enthusiasm have also increased, laying the foundation for further development of democratic management and improvement of production.

    东北鸡鸭公司开展民主运动
    依靠工人改造了领导
    【本报讯】哈尔滨市国营东北鸡鸭公司于七月中旬开展民主管理运动，党政工统一配合，深入发动工人，对领导上严重的官僚主义进行批评检讨，教育干部，改进工作，启发了工人的主人翁思想。运动开展之前各方面经过了必要的准备和酝酿。工厂内的共产党员首先在党内进行批评检讨，根据二中全会的精神深刻认识过去官僚主义管理的错误。党、政、工干部继之分头深入到工人中进行启发教育，对工人的种种顾虑，用上大课的办法，或用领导干部自行检讨过去的错误的办法，打破工人怕提意见不顶事，怕打了饭碗，怕受打击等思想顾虑，给工人撑腰。同时并通过工人中的骨干分子宣传与带动大家，说明提意见是为着改进工作，帮助领导。经过这样的发动后，工人把各方面的意见大部分都提出来了，态度也很正确，都是针对着生产管理上的缺点，提出建设性的意见：如何减少浪费，防止事故，保管、修理机器及提供新的生产办法。使领导干部从工人群众的意见中得到很大教育，更加认清了自己的错误和虚心向工人学习的必要。经过这次运动，该公司开办两年多以来所存在的一些不合理的制度得到了彻底的改进，某些有关工人福利的实际问题，如工作服、草帽、伙食、宿舍等已行解决，工人的主人思想与生产积极性也随着提高，打下了进一步开展民主管理和提高生产的基础。
