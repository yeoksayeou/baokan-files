    Covered in machine oil,
     Some haven't even washed their hands,
     Just plopped down on the long bench,
     Taking out pencils and notebooks,
     It's six o'clock,
     The chairman announces the meeting.
     The meeting room is like a hot spring,
     Twenty-eight warm hearts
     Concentrating like electromagnets,
     Fifty-six eyes
     Like fifty-six lamps,
     Illuminating everyone's face.
    ×    ×        ×
     "Now let's review the work,
     Please report voluntarily, group leaders."
     Old Liu wiped his sweat and said enthusiastically:
     "Last month, the forging department
     Manufactured five hundred automobile leaf springs
     For the People's Liberation Army transportation brigade.
     Everyone's production enthusiasm is high,
     They even reduced the time spent going to the toilet while working."
     "The Ninghe area is suffering from drought,
     Our electromechanical department assembled one hundred and fifty waterwheels.
     In the past (before liberation), this kind of waterwheel
     Required two animals to pull it.
     Now we have reformed and researched it,
     Sharpening and flattening the gears,
     And adding ball bearings to the axle.
     Now it only takes one animal to pull it,
     And it can irrigate thirty mu of paddy fields a day."
     "When manufacturing automobile half-shafts,
     Some people in our department are still technically conservative.
     When we ask him for guidance, he shakes his head.
     It's really like dumplings cooking in a teapot, unwilling to share what he knows."
      ×    ×          ×
     Finally, we discussed "further improving production quantity and quality."
     Electric Roller suggested:
     "We should establish an inspection room.
     It's not enough just to have the required quantity,
     We must test how durable it is!
     Evaluating merit should not only be based on numbers,
     But also on quality."
     "Agreed! Agreed!"
     Fifty-four hands are raised like fifty-four drumsticks.
     The chairman smiled and concluded,
     And gathered all the opinions together,
     Ready to report to the Federation of Trade Unions!

    工人小组长生产会
    海渴
    带着满身机器油
     有的还没有洗手
     就一屁股坐上长板凳
     掏出铅笔和日记本
     时间到了六点
     主席宣布开会。
     会议室象个温泉
     二十八颗亲热的心
     象电磁向一块集中
     五十六只眼睛
     象五十六盏灯
     互相照耀着每人的面孔。

     “现在检查工作
     请各小组长自动报告”
     老刘擦了擦汗起劲地说：
     “锻工部上月份
     给解放军运输大队
     制造出五百根汽车钢板（弓子）
     大家的生产情绪很高
     干活时连解小便都减少了。”
     “宁河一带闹旱
     咱门机电部装出一百五十台水车
     从前（未解放前）这种水车
     得两个牲口才能拉动
     现在咱们把它改造研究
     把齿轮旋得尖又平
     在轮轴里加进了滚珠
     现在只顶一个牲口就能拉动
     一天能灌稻田三十亩”
     “制造汽车半截轴
     咱们部里还有人把技术保守
     向他请教他摇摇头
     真有点茶壶里煮饺子有货不向外倒”
      ×    ×          ×
     最后讨论到“生产量再和质的提高”
     电滚子提议说：
     “我们应该成立一个检验室
     出了货够了数还不成
     必须检验它耐不耐用？
     评功不光在数字上核定
     还应该在质量上划定”
     “赞成！赞成！”
     五十四只手象举起五十四只大鼓捶
     主席笑嘻嘻作了结论
     又把所有的意见集在一起
     准备呈报到职工总会去！
