Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 5th. The preparatory committee of the All-China Journalists Association is now actively deploying various preparatory tasks. The draft charter of the association, which has been basically approved at the plenary meeting of the preparatory committee, has been repeatedly discussed by the standing committee and was finally revised and approved today (the 5th) (full text of the charter will be issued separately). According to the provisions of the charter, the standing committee elected Hu Qiaomu as the director of the preparatory committee, Hu Yuzhi and Liao Chengzhi as deputy directors, and formulated a list of candidates for various working bodies under its jurisdiction. Regarding the organizational principles of the preparatory committee branches, the standing committee decided that local branches should first start in central cities such as Shenyang, Beiping, Tianjin, Xi'an, Hankou, Nanjing, and Shanghai, and the preparatory committee members stationed in each location should expand the solicitation of journalists from all aspects and from the areas under the jurisdiction of each central city to jointly initiate the organization. After the establishment of the branches, they should promote the establishment of temporary organizations of journalists in larger cities in each region in other forms (such as journalist symposiums, etc.) and assist in solving their problems. The standing committee decided that the first, second, third, and fourth field armies of the People's Liberation Army could initiate the organization of preparatory committee branches by the preparatory committee members stationed in each field army. The standing committee also determined that the central task of each preparatory committee branch is to summarize past experience in journalism, study the problems in current journalism work, prepare proposals for the general assembly and matters related to the generation of representatives from each region to attend the National Journalists Congress, and collect various materials required for the conference.
