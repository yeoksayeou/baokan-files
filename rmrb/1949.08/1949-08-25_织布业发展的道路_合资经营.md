　　The Path to Development for the Weaving Industry—Joint Operation
　　The transition from decentralization to centralization is a necessary process for the development of small-scale industry, and the weaving industry in Shijiazhuang is currently facing such a problem.
　　Shijiazhuang currently has 64 private weaving workshops, the majority of which, 22 households, have two looms each. Fourteen households have four looms, and only one or two households have seven to ten looms. The household with the most capital possesses no more than seventy or eighty bundles of cotton yarn, while most have only thirty or forty bundles, or even just seven or eight bundles.
　　In the past, the products of these small workshops and independent laborers were mainly "Planet" white cloth. Before the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, few foreign goods could compete with them, except for the "Mountain Deer" cloth from the Da Xing Yarn Factory and the "Abundant Clothing" cloth from the Yu Min Company in this city. At that time, Shijiazhuang was the only large city in the North China Liberated Area, and buyers from the surrounding towns and villages came here, so sales were never a problem. In addition, with strong government support, the industry grew from twenty-odd households to its current number after liberation.
　　Now, there is competition from higher quality and cheaper cloth from larger cities. After Tianjin's "Five Blessings" cloth and "Sunshine" cloth entered the market in this city, the sales of "Planet" cloth greatly decreased due to its poor quality and high cost. In addition, most of the city's weaving machines were shut down for a period of time due to seasonal factors. Is it, as some people say, "collapsing"? We can say with certainty: absolutely not. The weaving industry in Shijiazhuang still has a bright future.
　　First, from a broader perspective, the national textile industry is still quite immature. After the imperialist forces of aggression were driven out of China, there are markets everywhere in the country. This city is one of the transportation hubs in North China, with convenient transportation and sales. It is close to Shanxi and southern Hebei; further away, such as Suiyuan and Mongolia, are vast cotton cloth markets. Although the sales of "Planet" white cloth are not good, more than half of the weaving workshops in the city are now weaving striped cloth or printed base cloth. This type of cloth is extremely suitable for the needs of the vast rural areas, and currently each bolt generally earns a profit of one-fifth, and sales are not a problem.
　　Second, this city is close to cotton-producing areas, where raw materials are cheap, and close to coal-producing areas, where fuel is cheap (which Shanghai cannot match). Transportation is also very convenient. After the opening of the Shijin Canal, cotton fields will be properly irrigated, and production will greatly increase. Therefore, this place can be regarded as a cotton textile industrial zone with great development prospects. Currently, the Da Xing Yarn Factory, under the influence of the new situation, is seeking to improve equipment, reduce costs, and improve quality. As long as private factories can reduce costs, it will not be difficult for white cloth to open up sales.
　　Third, in terms of new favorable conditions, all the important industrial zones in the country have now been liberated, and international trade has begun to be established. Objective conditions have allowed us to purchase new production tools and improve production. Recently, the Xinhua and Chengcheng weaving factories switched to electric motors, and output doubled, and the quality was better than that of semi-manual products (originally, a wooden machine could weave one bolt of striped cloth in twelve hours, or two-thirds of a bolt of white cloth). A five-horsepower electric motor, if fully utilized, can drive ten machines. Now, one worker supervises one machine, but by using large shuttles, each person can supervise two machines. Changing the shaft and winding line to electric drive can also reduce labor by two-thirds. Yu Sheng Xiang, Hua Qian San, Da Sheng, and other three weaving factories are preparing to purchase new weaving machines to further improve output and quality.
　　The main problem now is how to use these favorable conditions to improve equipment and increase production based on existing strengths.
　　The weaving factories listed above are all middle and upper-level households in the industry. Although they have already, or are planning to, take a step forward on the existing basis, it is ultimately very limited. Taking the Chengcheng Weaving Factory as an example, a five-horsepower electric motor can drive ten wooden machines, or six new weaving machines, but its current capacity can only operate four wooden machines (note: a new weaving machine is worth forty bundles of yarn, a five-horsepower electric motor is worth thirty-five bundles of yarn, and a wooden machine is worth four bundles of yarn). Hua Qian San, Yu Sheng Xiang, Da Sheng, and other factories can only purchase one new weaving machine each, and each plans to equip several wooden machines with the remaining horsepower. Even so, they still need strong public assistance. For example, the loans granted by the People's Bank to each factory exceed more than half of the original capital, with a term of half a year; this can be regarded as a special preferential treatment to encourage increased production.
　　For the majority of small and medium-sized households that account for the vast majority of weaving machines in the city, it is indeed difficult to improve equipment solely based on their own strength. However, if they do not improve equipment, they will not be able to increase production, and the result will inevitably be elimination.
　　The current situation is very clear. It is both difficult for them to increase capital independently, and they must increase production. Then, joint operation must be the best strategy. This is an inevitable trend under the influence of the new situation. Judging from the specific situation of the weaving industry in this city, most medium and upper-level households can adopt the method of joint operation. If Hua Qian San, Yu Sheng Xiang, Da Sheng, and other factories, or even more, can jointly operate, they only need to set up a larger power source to solve the problem. If they can make full use of it, various equipment such as sizing, bleaching, and dyeing can be improved in addition to new weaving machines. The coordinated tools of each department will improve production efficiency even more. Other personnel, miscellaneous, and other expenses can also save a lot; it is even more convenient when the public provides support. As for independent laborers with one or two weaving machines, they should organize cooperatives. In this way, everyone can concentrate on operations, which not only improves equipment, but also makes production and sales more convenient and cost-effective than independent operations; secondly, they can also receive more care from the government in terms of loans and taxes.
　　Of course, some factory owners think that there will be many difficulties in joint operation, such as personnel, operating methods, and other differences. However, for the survival and development of the weaving industry, these are ultimately secondary. As long as everyone can see far ahead, not haggle over small things, and formulate scientific and reasonable rules and regulations for joint operation based on the spirit of equality and mutual assistance, get rid of the feudal old habits in operation, and adopt modern operating methods and personnel systems, all problems can be easily solved. In short, as the trend of the times dictates, today, the private weaving industry in Shijiazhuang can only increase production through joint operation.

### 织布业发展的道路—合资经营

　　织布业发展的道路—合资经营
    从分散到集中是小型工业发展的必经过程，目前石家庄的织布业正面临着这样一个问题。
    石家庄现有私人织布作坊六十四家，其中有两台织布机的占最多数，共二十二户，四台织布机的十四户，七台到十台的仅一户或两户，一台机的三户。各户资金最多的不过值七、八十捆棉纱，一般都是三、四十捆或七、八捆。
    这些小型作坊和独立劳动者的产品，过去主要为“星球”白布。在平津解放以前，除本市大兴纱厂的“山鹿布”和裕民公司的“丰衣”布的质量在它们之上外，很少有外地货能和它们竞争。当时，石家庄是华北解放区的唯一大城市，四周城镇乡村购买者都来此，销路从来不成问题；加以政府大力扶植，该业在解放后，由二十几户发展到现在的数目。
    现在，有大城市的物美价廉的布匹来竞争了，天津的“五福”布和“阳光”布来到本市的市场后，“星球”布因质量差，成本高，销路大减。加上前一段时间由于季节性的影响，全市大部分织布机都停了工。是不是象有些人所说的“垮台”了呢？我们可以肯定的说：绝对不是，石家庄织布业还是有它远大的前途的。
    第一、从较大的范围来看，全国纺织工业还相当幼稚，帝国主义侵略魔力被赶出中国以后，国内到处都是市场。本市为华北交通枢纽之一，运销方便，临近山西、冀南；稍远如绥远、蒙古都是广大的棉布市场，“星球”白布虽然销路不佳，但现在全市一半以上织布作坊都改织条子布或印花底布。这类布匹极适合广大农村需要，目前每匹一般可获五分之一利润，销路也无问题。
    第二、本市接近产棉区，原料便宜，接近产煤区，燃料便宜（这是上海所不及的），交通亦很方便、石津运河开放后，棉田得到适当灌溉，产量还要大增；故此地很可作为棉织工业区，有着很大的发展前途。目前大兴纱厂在新形势影响下，正谋改善设备，减低成本，提高质量。私人工厂只要成本能降低，白布也不难打开销路。
    第三、再就新的有利条件说，现全国重要工业区都已解放，国际贸易已开始建立，客观条件已允许我们购买新式生产工具，改良生产。最近新华、成城两家织布厂改用电动机，产量即增加一倍，质量也较半人工的出品为佳（原来一台木机工作十二小时，可织条子布一匹，织白布可织三分之二匹）。一架五马力电动机，若充分利用，可以带动十台机。现在是一个工人看管一台机，改用大型梭子每人即可看管两台，打轴、络线改用电力带动，人工也可减少三分之二。裕生祥、化乾三、大生等三家织布厂正筹备购买新式织布机，以使产量品质提高一步。
    现在主要的问题，是如何就现有力量利用这些有利条件，来改善设备，提高生产。
    以上列举的几家织布厂，它们都是该业的中上户，虽然已经或正在计划在现有基础上提高一步，但究竟很有限；就成城织布厂来说，一架五马力电动机本可带动十台木机，或可带动六台新式织布机，但它现有能力却只能开四台木机（按：一台新式织布机价值四十捆纱，一架五马力电动机为三十五捆纱，一台木机为四捆纱）。化乾三、裕生祥、大生等厂，每家仅能购买一台新式织布机，剩余马力，每家计划配置几台木机。就这样它们还是须靠公家的大力帮助。例如人民银行对各厂所放贷款，都是超过原资金一半以上，时间半年；为了奖励提高生产，可算是特别优待。
    对于占全市织布机绝大多数的中小户，要单凭他们各自力量来改善设备，实是较困难的事。但是，如不改善设备，则又无法提高生产，结果必遭淘汰。
    目前的情形很明显，它们单独增加资本既困难，又非提高生产不可，那就必须以合资经营为上策。这是新形势影响下的必然趋向。就目前本市织布业具体情况来看，一般中上户都可以采取合资经营的方式。假如化乾三、裕生祥、大生等厂或更多几家能合资经营，首先只需设置一个较大的动力就可解决问题，如能予以充分利用，除新式织布机之外，浆、漂、染等各项设备都可以改善。各部门工具配合一致，生产效率更可提高。其它人事、杂用等各项开支也可以节省很多；甚至在公家扶植时也比较方便。至于一台或两台织布机的独立劳动者，更应该组织合作社。这样，大家集中经营，不仅能改善设备，同时，对生产推销都比独立经营方便合算；其次在贷款、税收等方面也可得到政府更多照顾。
    当然，有些厂主想到合资经营会有很多困难，例如人事、经营方式等被此都可能有异见，可是为了织布业的生存和发展，这些究竟是次要的，只要大家能看得远，不在小地方斤斤计较，根据平等互助的精神订定科学合理的合资经营的规则章程，摆脱经营中的封建旧习，而采取近代化的经营方式、人事制度，一切问题自易解决。总之，大势所趋，今天，石家庄的私人织布业只有合资经营，才能提高生产。
