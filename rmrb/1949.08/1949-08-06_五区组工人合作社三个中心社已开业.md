    [This newspaper dispatch] To prevent workers' lives from suffering due to fluctuations in grain prices, the Municipal People's Government is working with the Cooperative General Office and the Trade Corporation to vigorously expand cooperative organizations. The Fifth District Federation of Trade Unions has decided to start organizing workers and other laboring citizens in the district. Five central workers' cooperatives will be established throughout the district, primarily for rickshaw pullers, and will also recruit construction workers, handicraft workers, and active and impoverished citizens, reducing their exploitation by merchants. At the same time, this will unite all workers in the Fifth District to wage an economic struggle against speculators. After several days of work, three central workers' cooperatives have been established, and the other two are being prepared and are in the process of collecting shares. Workers are enthusiastically buying shares, with 2,000 shares already subscribed. After everyone's discussion, the following was decided: (1) For membership procedures, any worker introduced by their respective trade union and reviewed by the District Federation of Trade Unions is eligible to join the cooperative. (2) Each share costs five catties of rice; if it cannot be paid all at once, it can be paid in installments. (3) The cooperative's service personnel are selected by the rickshaw pullers' unions in each street. Each person will temporarily receive 140 catties of rice as living expenses. Each cooperative will have no more than four people for every 1,000 shares, and personnel will be increased based on the amount of work if there are more than 1,000 shares. (4) The cooperative's staff has a clear division of responsibilities to avoid confusion. (5) In the morning, they will consult the General Office to understand market conditions, and in the evening, they will summarize the accounts and clear the inventory. The money will be deposited in the bank the next morning. (6) Cooperative groups will be established among the members to communicate work and collect members' opinions to improve work. (7) Members can purchase 45 catties of grain for large households and 20 catties for children under nine years old. (End)
