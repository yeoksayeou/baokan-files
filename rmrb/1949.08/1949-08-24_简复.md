　　Brief Reply to Mr. Zhao Bingqian:
    Reasons for hair loss: (1) Overuse of the brain, (2) Insomnia, (3) Eczema. There are currently no effective treatments. Reply to residents of Wanfuli, Shatu Mountain:
    Regarding your letter requesting the prohibition of children in the alley from defecating indiscriminately and the parking of manure carts, we have already dispatched personnel to provide guidance and correction. We will also maintain hygiene regularly in the future.
