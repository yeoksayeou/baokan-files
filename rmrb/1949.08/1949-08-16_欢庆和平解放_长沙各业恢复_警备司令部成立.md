Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, August 15th: Frontline reporter Li Yang reports: The enthusiastic mood of Changsha citizens celebrating the peaceful liberation of Changsha has not waned at all in the past week. Every day until after midnight, the streets and alleys are still crowded with happy people, with Yangko teams dancing one after another. Workers and students often unite to dance and sing on the main streets, then stand on tables and benches to explain the Eight Articles of Agreement of the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army to the citizens, and promote the PLA's urban discipline and the CCP's urban industrial and commercial policies. Occasionally, a few PLA soldiers walk by, and workers, students, and citizens shout: "Welcome the People's Liberation Army!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!" Most of the stores in the city have now opened, and customers are very crowded, forming a sharp contrast to the deserted market a month ago. A shop owner who just returned from the countryside told reporters: "The city is much more lively than before, and business is easier to do. I will open tomorrow." The bookstore business is particularly prosperous. People from all walks of life are buying books, vying to purchase Chairman Mao's works and books from the liberated areas transported from Shanghai and other places. Although American bandit planes come to harass from time to time, the city has lost its past atmosphere of terror and presents a thriving scene. Grain and vegetables are continuously transported from the surrounding countryside into the city every day. The surrounding highways have begun to open to traffic. Passenger cars from Changsha to Jiangling, Nanchang, Pingjiang, and Liuyang will officially sell tickets within the next few days. The railway south extends to Zhuzhou. The Navigation Bureau is also preparing to resume navigation soon. The post office received and delivered mail to the liberated areas on the third day after the peaceful liberation. The Telecommunications Bureau has also sent a working team to inspect the surrounding power lines, and the employees are working hard to strive to repair the telecommunications links with various liberated areas as soon as possible.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, August 15th: The Changsha Garrison Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was established on the 9th under orders, with Jie Peiran as commander, Cao Ying as political commissar, Ren Changhui as deputy commander, and Wang Jingwei as deputy political commissar.

　　欢庆和平解放
  　长沙各业恢复
  　警备司令部成立
    【新华社长沙十五日电】前线记者黎阳报道：长沙市民欢庆长沙和平解放的热烈情绪，一周来迄未稍衰。每天到深夜十二时以后，街头巷尾还到处拥挤着快乐的人群，秧歌队扭过一队又一队。工人们和学生们常常联合在一起，在几条主要的大街上，扭一阵，唱一阵，然后站在桌凳上，向市民解释人民解放军总部的约法八章，宣传解放军的城市纪律和中共的城市工商业政策。偶然有几个解放军军人走过，工人、学生和市民们就高呼着：“欢迎解放军！”“毛主席、朱总司令万岁！”市内的商店现已大部开门，顾客非常拥挤，和一个月前市面冷清的情况形成强烈的对照。一个刚从乡下回来的商店老板对记者说：“城里比过去热闹多了，买卖也好做了，我明天就要开门哩。”书店里的生意特别兴隆，买书的人各行各业都有，他们争相购买着毛主席的著作和从上海等地运来的解放区书籍，尽管美式匪机不时前来骚扰，这个城市已消失了过去的恐怖气息，呈现着欣欣向荣的景象。粮食菜蔬每日源源不断地从四乡运进城来。四周的公路已经开始通车。从长沙开往江陵、南昌、平江、浏阳的客车，日内即将正式售票。铁路南面通到了株州。航务局也准备不久复航。邮政局在和平解放后的第三天，即收递寄往解放区的邮件。电信局亦已派出工作队检查四周的电线，员工们都以紧张的工作来争取早日修复与各已解放地区的电信联络。
    【新华社长沙十五日电】中国人民解放军长沙警备司令部，已于九日奉命成立，解沛然任司令员，曹瑛任政治委员，任昌辉任副司令员，王景为副政治委员。
