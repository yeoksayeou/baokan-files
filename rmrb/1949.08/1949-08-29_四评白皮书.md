　　Our criticisms of the main points of the American White Paper have already been given in three editorials ("A Helpless Confession," "Discard Illusions, Prepare for Struggle," "Farewell, Leighton Stuart"). These criticisms have already aroused widespread attention and discussion among all democratic parties, people's organizations, newspapers, schools, and democratic figures from all walks of life across the country, and have published many correct and beneficial statements, talks, or commentaries. Various symposiums discussing the White Paper are being held, and the overall discussion is still developing. The scope of discussion involves Sino-American relations, Sino-Soviet relations, Sino-foreign relations over the past century, the interrelationship between the Chinese revolution and world revolutionary forces, the relationship between the Kuomintang reactionaries and the Chinese people, the attitude that various democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic figures from all walks of life should adopt in the anti-imperialist struggle, the attitude that liberals or so-called democratic individualists should adopt in the overall domestic and foreign relations, and how to deal with new imperialist conspiracies, etc. This phenomenon is very good and very educational.
    The whole world is now discussing the Chinese revolution and the American White Paper. This is not accidental. It shows the great significance of the Chinese revolution in the entire world history. As far as the Chinese people are concerned, our revolution has basically triumphed, but for a long time, we have not had the opportunity to fully discuss this revolution and its interrelationships with various aspects at home and abroad. This discussion is necessary, and now an opportunity has been found, which is the discussion of the American White Paper. In the past, the reason why such a discussion did not have the opportunity was because the revolution had not yet achieved a basic victory, the Chinese and foreign reactionaries had isolated the big cities from the People's Liberation Army, and the development of the revolution had not fully exposed the various contradictory aspects. Now it is different. Most of China has been liberated, and all the contradictory aspects at home and abroad have been fully exposed. Just as the United States published the White Paper, this opportunity for discussion has been found.
    The White Paper is a counter-revolutionary book that openly expresses American imperialism's interference in China. In this regard, it shows that imperialism has deviated from the norm. The great and victorious Chinese revolution has forced one aspect, one faction, within the American imperialist group to publicly publish some real materials of its opposition to the Chinese people and make reactionary conclusions to answer the attacks of another aspect, another faction, otherwise they would not be able to survive. Open exposure replaces concealment and cover-up, which is a manifestation of imperialism deviating from the norm. A few weeks ago, before the publication of this White Paper, the counter-revolutionary cause of the imperialist government was being carried out every day, but in words and official documents, it was always full of benevolence, righteousness, and morality, or at least somewhat carried some benevolence, righteousness, and morality, and never told the truth. The cunning and cunning British imperialism and other small imperialist countries are still like this. The rising, nouveau riche, neurasthenic American imperialist system of Truman, Marshall, Acheson, Leighton Stuart, etc., which is suffering from opposition from the people on the one hand and opposition from a faction among its partners on the other, believes that it is necessary and feasible to debate with their partners about which counter-revolutionary method is more clever by publicly exposing some (not all) counter-revolutionary truths. They attempt to use this to convince their opponents in order to continue their counter-revolutionary methods that they consider more clever. Two factions of counter-revolutionaries compete, one saying our method is the best, and the other saying our method is the best. They argued endlessly, and one faction suddenly showed its cards, bringing out many of the magic weapons it had used, called the White Paper.
    In this way, the White Paper has become an educational material for the Chinese people. For many years, on many issues, mainly on the nature of imperialism and the nature of socialism, what we Communists have said has always been regarded with doubt by some (there used to be many) Chinese, "I'm afraid it may not be the case." This situation changed after August 5, 1949. Acheson gave a lesson. Acheson spoke as the U.S. Secretary of State, and what he said and what we Communists or other advanced people said were exactly the same in terms of certain materials and conclusions. This time, we can't help but believe it, opening the eyes of groups of people, so that's what it is.
    In order to make it easier for people to study the main points of the White Paper, our agency has retranslated and published the full text of Acheson's letter to Truman, which is the preface to the White Paper. This preface is the main point of the White Paper. In order to help readers analyze this preface, this article is written again. The writing of this article follows the order of the preface to the White Paper, so that readers can compare it with the preface. In order to refute all the erroneous views in the preface, the article is a bit long, which is unavoidable.
    At the beginning of his letter to Truman, the preface to the White Paper, Acheson mentions the story of compiling his White Paper. He said that this White Paper of his is compiled differently, very objectively, and very frankly. "This is a frank record of the extremely complex problems of a great country in the most unpleasant period of its life; and for this great country, the United States has long had extremely close friendly ties. No usable item has been omitted because it contains statements criticizing our policies or may become the basis for future criticism. The inherent strength of our system is the responsiveness of the government to enlightened and critical public opinion. It is this kind of enlightened and critical public opinion that is intolerable and intolerant to totalitarian governments, whether right-wing or communist."
    Some connections of friendship between the peoples of China and the United States do exist. Through the efforts of both sides, this friendship may and will certainly develop into close and extremely close ties in the future. However, due to the obstruction of the reactionaries of China and the United States, this friendship has been greatly hindered in the past and present, and there are few connections. And because the reactionaries of the two countries have told many lies to the people of the two countries and dismantled many messes, that is, done a lot of bad propaganda and bad things, the friendship between the peoples of the two countries is not close. What Acheson calls "extremely close friendly ties" does not refer to the peoples of the two countries, but to the reactionaries of the two countries. Here, Acheson is neither objective nor frank. He confuses the relationship between the peoples of the two countries and the reactionaries of the two countries. For the peoples of the two countries, the victory of the Chinese revolution and the failure of the reactionaries of China and the United States are unprecedentedly pleasant things in their lives, and the current period is an unprecedentedly pleasant period in their lives. Only Truman, Marshall, Acheson, Leighton Stuart, and other American reactionaries, Chiang Kai-shek, Kung Hsiang-hsi, Song Ziwen, Chen Lifu, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and other Chinese reactionaries are the opposite, and it is indeed "the most unpleasant period in their lives."
    Acheson's views on public opinion confuse the reactionary public opinion and the people's public opinion. For the people's public opinion, Acheson's "responsiveness" is equal to zero. They are all blind and deaf. For several years, the people of the United States, China, and the whole world have opposed the reactionary foreign policy of the American government, and they have turned a deaf ear to it. What is the "enlightened and critical public opinion" that Acheson speaks of? It is the thousands of newspapers, news agencies, magazines, radio stations, and other propaganda organs manipulated by the two reactionary parties, the Republican and Democratic parties, which specialize in lying and threatening the people. For these things, Acheson is right, "The Communist Party (no, and the people) is intolerable and intolerant." Thus, the imperialist news offices have been closed by us, and the publication of imperialist news agencies to Chinese newspapers has been banned by us, and they are not allowed to freely poison the souls of the Chinese people again.
    The statement that the government led by the Communist Party is a "totalitarian government" is also half right. This government is a government that exercises dictatorship or autocracy over domestic and foreign reactionaries, and does not allow any domestic and foreign reactionaries to have any right to engage in counter-revolutionary activities freely. The reactionaries are angry and scold "totalitarian government." In fact, as far as the function of the people's government in suppressing reactionaries is concerned, it is indeed the case. This function or this power is now written in our program, and will be written in our constitution in the future. For the victorious people, this is something that cannot be separated for a moment like cloth, silk, soybeans, and millet. This is a good thing, a talisman, a family heirloom. Until the day when foreign imperialism and domestic classes are completely and cleanly eliminated, this magic weapon must not be discarded. The more the reactionaries scold "totalitarian government," the more it appears to be a treasure. But half of Acheson's words are wrong. The government of people's democratic dictatorship led by the Communist Party is not a dictatorship or autocracy for the people, but a democracy. This government is the people's own government, and it must listen to the people respectfully; at the same time, it is also the people's teacher, educating the people through self-education or self-criticism.
    Acheson's "right-wing totalitarian government," since the fall of the three fascist governments of Germany, Italy, and Japan, the American government is the first such government in this world. All bourgeois governments, including the reactionary governments of Germany, Italy, and Japan protected by imperialism, are such governments. The Tito government of Yugoslavia has joined this gang. China, because the people overthrew the Chiang Kai-shek government and established its own government, has withdrawn from the imperialist group and joined the anti-imperialist group. This type of government is a government in which the bourgeoisie, as a class (in China, it is the alliance of the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie), exercises dictatorship over the people. Everything about it is the opposite of the People's Government. There is so-called democracy within the bourgeoisie, but it is an autocracy for the people. The governments of Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, Franco, Chiang Kai-shek, Tito, etc. canceled or simply did not use the curtain of bourgeois internal democracy, because the domestic class struggle was so tense that it was more beneficial to cancel or simply not use that curtain, so as not to let the people also use that curtain to dance and gesticulate. The American government still has a piece of democratic cloth, but it has been cut very small by the American reactionaries and has faded greatly in color, which is far worse than the era of Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln. This is because the class struggle has been forced tighter by a few steps. If it is forced tighter by a few more steps, the American democratic cloth will inevitably fly to the sky.
    As everyone can see, Acheson made so many mistakes as soon as he opened his mouth. This is unavoidable because he is a reactionary. As for how "frank record" his White Paper is, we believe that there is frankness, and there is also no frankness. Acheson and his ilk are frank about things that they subjectively believe are beneficial to their party and faction, but they are not frank about things that are the opposite. Pretending to be frank is for the purpose of fighting.

### 四评白皮书

1949-08-29
第1版()
专栏：新华社社论

　　四评白皮书
    美国白皮书的要点，我们业已在三篇社论（“无可奈何的供状”、“丢掉幻想，准备斗争”、“别了，司徒雷登”）中给了批评。这些批评，业已引起了全国各民主党派，各人民团体，各报社，各学校，以及各界民主人士的广泛的注意和讨论，并发表了许多正确的和有益的声明，谈话，或评论。各种讨论白皮书的座谈会正在开，整个的讨论还在发展。讨论的范围涉及中美关系，中苏关系，一百年来的中外关系，中国革命和世界革命力量的相互关系，国民党反动派和中国人民的关系，各民主党派各人民团体及各界民主人士在反帝国主义斗争中应取的态度，自由主义者或所谓民主个人主义者在整个对内对外关系中应取的态度，对于帝国主义的新阴谋如何对付等等。这种现象是很好的，是很有教育作用的。
    现在全世界都讨论中国革命和美国的白皮书，这件事不是偶然的，它表示了中国革命在整个世界历史上的伟大意义。就中国人来说，我们的革命是基本上胜利了，但是很久以来还没有获得一次机会来详尽地展开讨论这个革命和内外各方面的相互关系。这种讨论是必需的，现在并已找到了机会，这就是讨论美国的白皮书。过去关于这种讨论之所以没有获得机会，是因为革命还没有得到基本上的胜利，中外反动派将大城市和人民解放军隔绝了，再则革命的发展还没有使几个矛盾侧面充分暴露的原故。现在不同了，大半个中国已被解放，各个内外矛盾的侧面都已充分地暴露出来，恰好美国发表了白皮书，这个讨论的机会就找到了。
    白皮书是一部反革命的书，它公开表示美帝国主义对于中国的干涉。就这一点来说，表现了帝国主义已经脱出了常轨。伟大的胜利的中国革命，已经迫使美帝国主义集团内部的一个方面，一个派别，要用公开发表自己反对中国人民的若干真实材料，并作出反动结论，去答复另一个方面，另一个派别的攻击，否则他们就混不下去了。公开暴露代替了遮藏掩盖，这就是帝国主义脱出常轨的表现。在几星期以前，在此次白皮书发表以前，帝国主义政府的反革命事业尽管每天都在做，但是在嘴上，在官方的文书上，却总是满篇仁义道德，或者多少带一些仁义道德，从来不说实话。老奸巨猾的英帝国主义及其他几个小帝国主义国家，至今还是如此。后起的暴发的神经衰弱的，一方面遭受人民反对另方面遭受其同伙中一派反对的美国杜鲁门、马歇尔、艾奇逊、司徒雷登等人的帝国主义系统，认为以公开暴露若干（不是一切）反革命真相的方法来和他们同伙中的对手辩论究竟那一种反革命方法较为聪明的问题，是必要的和可行的。他们企图借此以说服其对手，以便继续他们自认为较为聪明的反革命方法。两派反革命竞赛，一派说我们的法子最好，另一派说我们的法子最好。争得不得开交了，一派突然摊牌，将自己用过的许多法宝搬出来，名曰白皮书。
    这样一来，白皮书就变成了中国人民的教育材料。多少年来，在许多问题上，主要地是在帝国主义的本性问题和社会主义的本性问题上，我们共产党人所说的，在若干（曾经有一个时期是很多）中国人看来，总是将信将疑的，“怕未必罢”。这种情况，在一九四九年八月五日以后起了一个变化。艾奇逊上课了，艾奇逊以美国国务卿的资格说话了，他所说的和我们共产党人或其他先进人们所说的，就某些材料和结论来说，如出一辙。这一下，可不能不信了，使成群的人打开了眼界，原来是这么一回事。
    为了使人们便于研究白皮书的要点，本社重译了并发表了艾奇逊致杜鲁门信即白皮书序言的全文，这个序言即是白皮书的要点。为了帮助读者们分析这个序言起见，再写本文。本文写法是按照白皮书序言的次序，以便读者和序言对看。为了要批驳序言中的一切错误观点，文章长一点，这是不可避免的。
    艾奇逊在其致杜鲁门信即白皮书序言的开头，提起他编纂白皮书的故事。他说他这本白皮书编得与众不同，很客观，很坦白。“这是关于一个伟大的国家在一生最不愉快的时期中极端复杂的问题的坦白纪录；而对于这个大国，美国早就有着极亲密的友谊的联系。没有一个可用的项目因为其中含有批评我们的政策的语句或可能成为将来遭受批评的基础，而把它省略掉。我们制度的固有的力量是政府对于有识见又好批评的舆论之感应性。正是此种有识见又好批评的舆论，是极权政府不论右派或共产党所不能忍受且不宽容的。”
    中美两国人民间的友谊的某些联系是存在的。经过双方的努力，这种友谊，将来可能也一定会发展到亲密的和极亲密的联系。但是因为中美两国反动派的阻隔，这种友谊过去和现在都受到了极大的阻碍，联系很少。并且因为两国反动派向两国人民撒了许多谎，拆了许多烂污，就是说做了许多坏宣传和坏事，使得两国人民的友谊并不密切。艾奇逊所说的“极亲密的友谊的联系”，不是说的两国人民，而是说的两国反动派。在这里，艾奇逊既不客观，也不坦白，他混淆了两国人民和两国反动派的相互关系。对于两国人民，中国革命的胜利和中美两国反动派的失败，是一生中空前地愉快的事，目前的这个时期，是一生中空前地愉快的时期。只有杜鲁门、马歇尔、艾奇逊、司徒雷登及其他美国反动派，蒋介石、孔祥熙、宋子文、陈立夫、李宗仁、白崇禧及其他中国反动派与此相反，确是“一生中最不愉快的时期”。
    艾奇逊们对于舆论的看法，混淆了反动派的舆论和人民的舆论。对于人民的舆论，艾奇逊们的“感应性”等于零，他们都是瞎子和聋子。几年来，美国，中国及全世界的人民反对美国政府的反动的对外政策，他们是充耳不闻的。什么是艾奇逊所说的“有识见又好批评的舆论”呢？就是被美国共和、民主两个反动政党所操纵的成千成万的报纸，通讯社，刊物，广播电台等项专门说谎和威胁人民的宣传机关。对于这些东西，艾奇逊说对了，“共产党（不，还有人民）是不能忍受，且不宽容的”。于是乎帝国主义的新闻处被我们封闭了，帝国主义的通讯社对中国报纸的发稿被我们下令禁止了，不允许它们自由自在地再去毒害中国人民的灵魂。
    共产党领导的政府是“极权政府”的话，也有一半是说得对的。这个政府是对于内外反动派实行专政或独裁的政府，不让任何内外反动派有任何反革命的自由活动的权利。反动派生气了，骂一句“极权政府”。其实，就人民政府关于镇压反动派的职能来说，千真万确地是这样的。这个职能或这个权力，现在写在我们的纲领上，将来还要写在我们的宪法上。对于胜利了的人民，这是如同布帛菽粟一样的不可以须臾离的东西。这是一样好东西，是一个护身法宝，是一个传家法宝，直到国外的帝国主义和国内的阶级被彻底干净消灭之日，这个法宝是万万不可以弃置不用的。越是反动派骂“极权政府”，就越显得是一个宝贝。但是艾奇逊的话有一半是说错了。共产党领导的人民民主专政的政府，对于人民内部来说，不是专政或独裁的，而是民主的。这个政府是人民自己的政府，它对人民必须是恭恭敬敬地听话的；同时又是人民的先生，用自我教育或自我批评的方法教育人民。
    艾奇逊所说的“右派极权政府”，自从德意日三个法西斯政府倒了以后，在这个世界上，美国政府就是第一个这样的政府。一切资产阶级政府，包括受帝国主义庇护的德意日反动派政府在内，都是这样的政府。南斯拉夫的铁托政府加入了这一伙。中国因为人民打倒了蒋介石政府，建立了自己的政府，而退出了帝国主义集团，加入了反帝国主义集团。这一类型的政府是资产阶级一个阶级（在中国是地主阶级和官僚资产阶级的联盟）向人民实行专政的政府。它的一切都和人民政府相反，对于资产阶级内部是有所谓民主的，对于人民则是独裁的。希特勒，墨索里尼，东条，佛朗哥，蒋介石，铁托等人的政府取消了或者索性不用那片资产阶级内部民主的幕布，是因为国内阶级斗争紧张到了极点，取消或者索性不用那片布比较有利些，免得人民也利用那片布去手舞足蹈。美国政府现在还有一片民主布，但是已被美国反动派剪得很小了，又大大地褪了颜色，比起华盛顿，杰佛逊，林肯的朝代来是差远了，这是阶级斗争迫紧了几步的原故。再迫紧几步，美国的民主布必然要跑到九霄云外去了。
    大家可以看出，艾奇逊一开口就错了这许多。这是不可避免的，因为他是反动派。至于说，他的白皮书是怎样一个“坦白纪录”这一点，我们认为坦白是有的，也是没有的。艾奇逊们主观上认为有利于他们一党一派的东西，他们是有坦白的，反之则是没有的。装作坦白，是为了作战的目的。
