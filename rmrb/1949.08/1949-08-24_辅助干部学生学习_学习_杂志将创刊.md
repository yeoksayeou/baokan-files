　　To coincide with the nationwide upsurge in learning and to assist cadres, workers, and students in studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the Sanlian Bookstore (formerly New China Bookstore) has recently decided to renovate the content and expand the size of the "Learning Life" magazine, originally published in Northeast China, rename it "Learning," and move its publication to Ping. The first issue is scheduled to be published on September 5th. The editorial board of the magazine has been formed by the editorial and review department of Sanlian Bookstore, inviting experts in social sciences, natural sciences, and other fields. The central content is to analyze and explain issues in politics, economics, history, culture, and art from the basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, in the spirit of combining theory with practice, and to provide readers with examples for study and research. The main columns include essays, special articles and serials, reading guidance, writing guidance, ideological criticism, learning Q&A, learning correspondence, etc. Because the main purpose of the magazine is to assist readers in learning, special attention is paid to the latter two items. In order to maintain close contact with readers, the magazine is vigorously carrying out correspondence work and hopes that learning groups in various organs, factories, schools, and organizations will establish direct contact with them.
