　　Shanghai People's Representatives Conference Telegram
  　Saluting Chairman Mao
  　Supporting the Speedy Convening of the New Political Consultative Conference

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th] The Shanghai People's Representatives Conference unanimously passed a telegram on the afternoon of the 5th, saluting Chairman Mao and supporting the speedy convening of the New Political Consultative Conference. The text of the telegram is as follows:

　　To Chairman Mao in Beiping:

　　At a time when the People's Liberation Army has victoriously crossed the Yangtze River and is continuing its southward advance, with nationwide victory not far off, and when the people of all circles in Shanghai, under the leadership of the People's Government, are making every effort to carry out peaceful construction, the imperialists and their running dogs, the remnant forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries, have not only failed to change their sinful policy of aggression against China and their destructive conspiracies against the Chinese people because of the leniency of the People's Government and their own disastrous military and political defeats, but have instead further colluded with each other in an attempt to undermine our peaceful construction in Shanghai and force us to submit to imperialism through barbaric means such as bombing, strafing, and armed blockade. While deeply hating this, the people of all circles in Shanghai deeply recognize that the current difficulties are entirely caused by the imperialists and their running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries. The people of the entire city of Shanghai have clearly realized from the lessons of the enemy's constant bombing and armed blockade that it is impossible to complete the liberation of the Chinese people and smoothly carry out the construction of New Democracy without thoroughly expelling imperialism from China and completely eliminating all the remnant forces of the Kuomintang. Therefore, today, representatives of all circles in Shanghai are gathered together, under the leadership of the People's Government, to discuss how to overcome difficulties, smash the enemy's blockade, and build a healthy new Shanghai. We unanimously believe that it is necessary to actively support the People's Liberation Army in its southward advance and quickly liberate all of China. At the same time, in order to smoothly carry out the construction of a New Democratic New China, we eagerly hope that the New Political Consultative Conference will be convened as soon as possible, and that the People's Democratic United Government will be established soon. We firmly believe that under your wise leadership, the Chinese people, who have defeated imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, will certainly be able to continue to overcome the difficulties created by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries under your great leadership, and victoriously carry out the construction of a New Democratic China. We wish you good health!

　　上海各界代表会议通电
  　向毛主席致敬
  　拥护迅速召开新政协
    【新华社上海十五日电】上海市各界代表会议于五日下午一致通过向毛主席致敬并拥护迅速召开新政协电，电文如下：
    北平毛主席钧鉴：
    当此人民解放军胜利过江，继续南进，全国胜利为期不远之时，当我上海市各界人民在人民政府领导之下，正全力进行和平建设之时，帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派残余势力，非但未因人民政府的宽大与其自身军事政治的惨败，而改变其罪恶的对华侵略政策及与中国人民为敌的破坏阴谋，反而进一步互相勾结，企图以轰炸扫射和武装封锁等野蛮手段来破坏我上海和平建设，并逼我向帝国主义就范。我上海市各界痛恨之余，深切认识目前的困难，完全是帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派所造成的。全上海市人民已从敌人的不断轰炸与武装封锁的教训中，清楚认识非彻底驱逐帝国主义出中国，非彻底消灭国民党一切残余势力，要想完成中国人民解放事业并顺利进行新民主主义的建设是不可能的。所以今天我上海各界人民代表聚首一堂，在人民政府领导之下，进行商讨如何克服困难粉碎敌人封锁与建设健全新上海的时候，一致认为必须积极支援人民解放军南下，迅速解放全中国。同时，为了顺利进行建设一个新民主主义的新中国，我们热切地希望新政治协商会议早日召开，人民民主联合政府早日成立。我们深信，在您英明领导下，战胜了帝国主义与国民党反动派的中国人民，必能继续在您的伟大领导下，战胜帝国主义与国民党反动派所造成的困难，胜利地进行人民民主的新中国的建设。并祝健康！
