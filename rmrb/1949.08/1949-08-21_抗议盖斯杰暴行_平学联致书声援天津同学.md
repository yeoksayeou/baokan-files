　　Protest Against Gasquet's Atrocities
  　Peiping Student Federation Sends Letter of Support to Tianjin Students
    [This City News] Regarding the incident of French national Gasquet illegally detaining students Chen Zhenhai and Li Fenglu from the Tianjin-Guji Affiliated High School, the Peiping Student Federation yesterday (20th) sent a letter to the Tianjin Student Federation. The original text is as follows: Tianjin Student Federation, forwarded to all middle school students in Tianjin:
    After hearing the news that French national Gasquet illegally detained students Chen Zhenhai and Li Fenglu from the Tianjin-Guji Affiliated High School, the students in Peiping were all extremely indignant. During the rule of the Kuomintang, the running dogs of imperialism, we resolutely protested against all the atrocities of imperialism. Now is no longer the era of Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of imperialism. On the land of the people's democratic China, we will not allow such atrocities to exist. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we will, together with the people of the whole country, drive the imperialist forces out of China. Now Gasquet still wants to flaunt the airs of imperialism, which is absolutely not allowed! The Chinese People's Government and the broad masses of the people will give him the punishment he deserves. We firmly support your actions and resolutely fight against imperialism!
  　Peiping Student Federation, August 20th

　　抗议盖斯杰暴行
  　平学联致书声援天津同学
    【本市讯】北平学联为法侨盖斯杰非法囚禁津沽附中同学事件，昨（二十）日致书天津学联，原文如下：天津学联转天津市大中学同学：
    法侨盖斯杰非法囚禁津沽附中同学陈振海、李凤禄的消息传来后，北平同学无不愤恨异常。在帝国主义走狗的国民党统治时期，我们曾为所有帝国主义的暴行坚决抗议过。现在已不是帝国主义走狗蒋介石统治的时代了，在人民民主的中国国土上，我们更不容许这种暴行存在。我们要在中国共产党的领导下，和全国人民一起，把帝国主义势力赶出中国去。现在盖斯杰竟然还想摆帝国主义的威风，是绝不容许的！中国人民政府和广大人民会给他以应得的教训。我们坚决支持你们的行动，坚决向帝国主义作斗争！
