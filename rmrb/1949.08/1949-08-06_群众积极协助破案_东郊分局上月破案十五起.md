    The Masses Actively Assist in Solving Cases
    The East Suburbs Branch Solved Fifteen Cases Last Month
    [From Our Newspaper] The East Suburbs Branch of the Public Security Bureau has launched a mass-based public security work campaign, and in July, it successively solved more than ten cases. The East Suburbs Branch was formed on July 1st by merging the original Suburban First and Suburban Second Branches. After its establishment, it systematically combined in-depth propaganda work during the registration of reactionary party and league members, special agents, and the general household survey. It also used various meetings to conduct mass public security education. The masses have realized ideologically that public security work is inseparable from protecting their own interests, and therefore consciously assist the Public Security Bureau in solving cases. Li Zhongjian, the village head of Guiwang'an Village, and Tang Shaoquan, the group leader, and two others discovered someone stealing electric wires on a rainy night. They braved the heavy rain to report to the police station and captured the thief. Yan Shaoqin and two other primary school students from Liulitun Village discovered a suspicious person in the sorghum field on their way home from school. The three children discussed it and sent one person to report to the Public Security Bureau, leaving two to monitor the person. After receiving the report, public security personnel searched according to the place pointed out by the children and captured the bandit Zhang Guqing (a Kuomintang stray soldier). Based on secret reports from the masses, the branch also captured Wu Delu, Wang Qi, and others in Shixianglu who had repeatedly stolen electric wires three times; and seized a pistol, 140 catties of electric wire, and more than 40 taels of drugs, etc. Before the two branches were merged, the Suburban First Branch's jurisdiction had a total of eleven cases in May and June, and only one case was solved. In July, a total of fourteen cases occurred in the East Suburbs Branch's territory, and fifteen cases were solved. Moreover, solving one case was actually equivalent to solving three or four cases. For example, some thieves repeatedly stole several times in May, June, and July, and as a result, they were caught at once. All the cases solved in July were jointly captured with the assistance of the masses. This is enough to prove that public security work must mobilize the masses and rely on the masses to achieve greater gains. (Guang)

    群众积极协助破案
    东郊分局上月破案十五起
    【本报讯】公安局东郊分局展开群众性的治安工作，七月份连续破案十数起。东郊分局系于七月一日起由原郊一、郊二两分局合并组成，成立后即有计划的在登记反动党团分子、特务分子及普查户口工作中结合着作深入宣传，并利用各种会议进行群众性的治安工作教育，群众在思想上已认识到治安工作与保护自己利益是分不开的，因此自觉的纷纷协助公安局破案。鬼王庵村长李忠建、小组长唐绍全等三人，在雨夜发现有人在偷窃电线，即冒着倾盆大雨来派出所报告，把窃犯捕获。六里屯村阎绍勤等三个小学生曾在放学回家路上，发现高粱地里有一个鬼鬼祟祟的人，三个小孩即商量好，派一人向公安局报告，留下两人监视着，治安人员得报后，照着小孩们指的地方进行搜索，捕获了匪犯张古卿（国民党流散军人）。分局在群众密报下，又在石香炉捕获连续窃电线三起的吴德禄、王起等人；并搜索出手枪一枝，电线一百四十斤，毒品四十余两等。在两分局未合并前，五六两月份郊一分局管区内共发生案件十一起，仅破获一起。七月份东郊分局境内共发生案件十四起，破获案件则达十五起。而且有的案件破获一起，实际等于破获了三、四起，如窃犯有的在五、六、七月连续流动偷窃数次，结果于一次将其破获。七月份所破案件，均系由群众的协助共同捕获的，由此足可证明：治安工作必须发动群众、依靠群众，才能得到更大收获。      （光）
