Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 14th—People from all walks of life in Jinan and Qingdao warmly support the trade agreement between Northeast China and the Soviet Union. The 84 representatives of the workers' congress of various factories under the Jinan Industrial Bureau expressed great joy at the conclusion of this agreement. Shi Zhendong, a worker representative from the bureau, said: "American imperialism helps the running dog Chiang Kai-shek to massacre the Chinese people, while the Soviet Union helps the Chinese people with economic construction. We firmly support this trade agreement." Staff member Qiu Zuming said: "The American-Chiang reactionaries are carrying out a criminal blockade of our coastal ports, vainly attempting to deepen our difficulties, but we are not afraid. We have the strength to overcome difficulties. The trade agreement between Northeast China and the Soviet Union has further enhanced the Chinese people's confidence in construction." Shang Lanting, from the privately owned Tongxing Oil Mill, said: "Now Northeast China is exchanging soybeans, corn, and other agricultural products for industrial equipment from the Soviet Union. In the future, Shandong can also exchange things like bristles, silk, and peanut oil for needed goods. Before the liberation of Jinan, there were more than 30 oil mills; in the ten months since liberation, the number has increased to 52. Shandong produces the most peanuts in the country, and there is an ample supply of raw materials. We can also export, so the oil industry in the province has great prospects." Student summer study groups in Qingdao schools have discussed the significance of this agreement for current economic construction. Feng Yuanjun, professor of the Literature Department of Shandong University, said: "The great Soviet Union is a wise teacher and helpful friend to China, and this agreement is worthy of our cherishing." Zhang Ruoming, director of the Qingdao office of the Shandong Youth Federation, said: "We should draw experience and lessons from this, and recognize the enemies and friends of our people."

    更增强了建设信心
    济南青岛人民坚决拥护
    【新华社济南十四日电】济南、青岛各界人民，热烈拥护东北与苏联的贸易协定。济南工业局各厂职工代表会的八十四名代表，对此协定的缔结表示非常欢喜。该局工人代表时振东说：“美帝国主义帮助走狗蒋介石屠杀中国人民，苏联是帮助中国人民经济建设，我们坚决拥护这个贸易协定。”职员邱祖明说：“美蒋对我沿海口岸进行罪恶封锁，妄图加深我们的困难，我们不怕，我们有力量克服困难。东北与苏联的贸易协定，使中国人民更增强了建设的信心。”私营同兴油坊尚兰亭说：“现在东北以大豆、玉米等农作物和苏联交换工业装备，我们山东将来也可以猪鬃、丝、花生油、交换需要的东西。济南解放前有油坊三十余家，解放十个月来增到五十二家。山东出产花生全国第一，原料充足，又能出口，全省油业前途远大。”青岛各校学生暑期学习小组都讨论了这一协定对目前经济建设的意义。山东大学文学系教授冯沅君说：“伟大的苏联是中国的贤师良友，这一协定值得我们珍重。”山东青联驻青办事处主任章若明说：“我们应从这里吸收经验教训，认清我们人民的敌人和朋友。”
