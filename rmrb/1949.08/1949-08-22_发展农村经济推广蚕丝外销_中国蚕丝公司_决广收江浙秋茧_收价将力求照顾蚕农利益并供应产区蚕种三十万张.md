  　China Silk Company
  　Decides to Widely Purchase Autumn Cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang
    Purchase Price Will Strive to Consider the Interests of Silkworm Farmers and Supply 300,000 Sheets of Silkworm Eggs to Production Areas
    [Shanghai News] In order to develop the rural economy, consider the difficulties of silkworm farmers, and promote silk exports, the China Silk Company has decided to purchase autumn cocoons from Jiangnan. Due to the past erroneous purchasing policies of the Kuomintang, the livelihoods of silkworm farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang were poorly protected, and cocoon prices fell year by year, differing greatly from the ratio of commodity prices. Therefore, this autumn's government purchases will strive for reasonable prices and adopt value-guaranteed methods, such as deposit accounts adjusted to reflect real values or barter, so that silkworm farmers can obtain tangible benefits and the rural economy can gradually recover.
    The areas covered by the China Silk Company's purchases this time include the vast rural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, supplying 300,000 sheets of autumn silkworm eggs. Starting from the 20th of this month, 100,000 sheets of silkworm eggs will be sold in the silkworm producing areas of Zhejiang Province; starting from the 25th of this month, 200,000 sheets of silkworm eggs will be sold in the silkworm producing areas of Jiangsu Province. The selling prices all take into account the purchasing power of silkworm farmers.
    Autumn silkworms in rural Jiangnan will begin to be raised in early September, and the first batch of cocoons can be put on the market in mid-September. It is estimated that this year's autumn cocoons will produce 40,000 dan in Jiangsu Province and 15,000 dan in Zhejiang Province, which is about one-third of the amount of fresh cocoons in the spring of this year (180,000 dan), which is in line with the general normal situation.
    In principle, it has been decided that the purchasing agency will entrust local cocoon firms to collect and dry the cocoons on its behalf, while the company will send personnel to supervise. As for the purchase price method and specific export measures, the company is currently discussing them.
    [Another News] In order to respond to the call to smash the enemy's blockade conspiracy, the two silk factories affiliated to the China Silk Company are now actively planning to improve their production so that it can better suit the needs of the vast people in the interior. In the past, the products of these two silk factories, in addition to exports, were some high-end silks exclusively for the enjoyment of a few wealthy people. Now, they are planning to shift their products to the masses of rural people in the interior.

　　发展农村经济推广蚕丝外销
  　中国蚕丝公司
  　决广收江浙秋茧
    收价将力求照顾蚕农利益并供应产区蚕种三十万张
    【上海讯】中国蚕丝公司为发展农村经济，照顾蚕农困难和推广蚕丝外销起见，决定收购江南秋茧。由于国民党过去收购政策之错误，江浙蚕农生活极少保障，茧价逐年下跌，与物价比例相差过远。故政府今秋收购，将力求合理价格，并采保值办法，例如折实存款或实物交换，使蚕农获得实惠，农村经济得以逐渐恢复。
    中蚕此次收购地区包括江浙广大农村，供应秋蚕种三十万张。本月二十日起，即在浙江省产蚕区发售蚕种十万张；本月二十五日起，将在江苏省产蚕区发售蚕种二十万张。发售价格，都照顾到蚕农的购买力。
    江南农村秋蚕，在九月初开始饲育，九月中旬首批蚕茧即可上市。估计今年秋茧，江苏省可产四万担，浙江省可产一万五千担，约合今年春季鲜茧数量（十八万担）三分之一，合乎一般正常情形。
    收购机构，原则上决定，将委托各地茧行代收代烘，而由该公司派员督导。至于收购价格方式，和外销具体办法，该公司正在讨论中。
    【又讯】中国蚕丝公司所属两个丝绸厂，为了响应粉碎敌人封锁阴谋的号召，现在正积极计划改进他们的生产，使能更适合内地广大人民的需要。这两个绸厂的产品，过去除外销以外，都是一些专给少数有钱人享受的高贵绸缎。现在，他们正计划把产品转向内地农村人民大众。
