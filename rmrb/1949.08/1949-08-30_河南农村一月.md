　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 29th:

　　The focus of rural work in Henan during July continued to be the suppression of bandits. Due to the gradual increase in the people's awareness, bandit suppression and political offensives are being carried out on a large scale. In addition, the summer tax collection was completed, and initial victories were achieved against locust plagues and floods.

　　In the newly liberated areas of Guanxiang, Lingbao, Huangchuan, and parts of Nanyang, bandits and secret agents robbed and sabotaged everywhere, disrupting social order. In other areas, hidden bandits and secret agents colluded with local bullies, using secret societies to carry out conspiracies. In order to thoroughly and completely eliminate bandits and secret agents and protect the interests of the people, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened its second party representative meeting on June 15th, clearly stipulating that in the coming period, the central task would be to combat bandits and local bullies, and all other work must revolve around bandit suppression. This decision received unanimous support from all levels of the people. In July, mobilization and arrangements were made for bandit suppression and political offensives, and three key command headquarters were organized in Shanluo, Nanyang, and Huangchuan to launch bandit suppression work. As of the end of July, multiple groups of bandits were successively annihilated in Zheng County, Baoling, Deng County, Nei County, Zhechuan, Yu County, and the Luoning mountainous area; most of the bandit gangs in Huangchuan fled to the Dabie Mountains and are currently being surrounded and suppressed separately. The work of clearing out scattered bandits and hidden bandits in Chenliu, Huaiyang, Shangqiu, and other places has also achieved results. The Linru, Baofeng, and Jia County areas in Xuchang sub-district have already carried out regional arrangements and reviews for the anti-local bully campaign. In addition, the anti-local bully struggles in Ye County, Xuchang, Xiangcheng, Wuyang, Yu County, and other places will also be completed.

　　Due to the gradual increase in the people's awareness, this year's summer tax collection proceeded smoothly. As of the end of July, Jia County and Zheng County had completed 100% of their quotas, and the entire region had completed an average of more than 80%. Especially in areas that had undergone the anti-local bully struggle, peasant representative meetings were convened, production was assessed, and the people's enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high; in areas that had not undergone the anti-local bully struggle, cadre meetings were also convened, and after assessing production and squeezing out hidden land, the burden was fairer than in the past. During the summer tax collection process, some cadres, in their eagerness to complete their tasks, adopted coercive methods, focusing solely on making lists and calculating burdens, without conducting extensive propaganda and education among the masses, which prevented the government's policy of reasonable burden from being implemented.

　　Since mid-June, locust nymphs have been discovered successively in 35 counties south of the Longhai Railway in Henan Province. In severely affected areas such as Song County, more than 2,000 mu of autumn seedlings were damaged, and the infestation quickly spread to an area of 8,000 mu. People's governments at all levels, on the one hand, carried out propaganda and mobilization to eliminate superstition, and on the other hand, organized the masses to vigorously kill locusts. After more than a month of capture and eradication, more than 4,000 jin of soybean-sized locust nymphs were captured in more than ten villages in Song County alone. The affected counties, using the method of village helping village and neighbor helping neighbor, finally initially suppressed this huge disaster, and quickly replanted late autumn crops in the disaster areas.

　　During the summer flood season of the Yellow River, the water level rose sharply. Thanks to the full preparation of cadres and the masses along the river and their strenuous efforts in flood control, there were no breaches. However, during the floods, more than 20 breaches occurred in the Ru River, Ying River, Qingni River, and Feng River, which had been in disrepair for many years in Henan Province. In early July, 26 villages in Runan, Shangcai, Xiping, and Zhuoping counties were flooded, resulting in the loss of more than 100,000 mu of cultivated land. In one sub-district of Xuchang, more than 300 villages were submerged, along with 253,500 mu of land, and more than 17,000 houses collapsed. Under the leadership of the people's government, the masses vigorously repaired and drained the accumulated water, and most of the disaster areas have now been planted with late autumn crops.

　　河南农村一月
    七月份的河南农村工作继续以剿匪为中心。由于群众觉悟逐渐提高，剿匪和政治攻势正在大规模地开展，此外，并完成了夏屯工作，和初步战胜了蝗灾、水灾。
    在新解放的关乡、灵宝、潢川及南阳的一部分地区，土匪特务到处抢劫破坏，扰乱社会秩序。其他各地潜藏的土匪特务，则勾结恶霸，利用会门，进行阴谋活动。为确实、彻底、全部地肃清土匪特务，保护人民利益，中共河南省委于六月十五日召开了第二次党代表会议，明确规定在今后一定时期内以反匪反恶霸为中心工作，其他一切工作必须围绕着剿匪来进行。这一决定获得各阶层人民的一致响应。七月间又进行了关于剿匪和政治攻势的动员和布置，组织了陕洛、南阳、潢川三个重点指挥部，展开剿匪工作。至七月底止，连续在郑县、宝灵、邓县、内县、浙川、禹县等地以及洛宁山区歼灭土匪多股；潢川股匪大多流窜大别山，刻正分别围剿。陈留、淮阳、商邱等地清剿散匪、潜匪的工作，也有成绩。许昌分区的临汝、宝丰、郏县等已经进行了反恶霸的地区正布置复查。此外，叶县、许昌、襄城、无阳、禹县等地的反恶霸斗争亦将结束。
    由于群众觉悟程度逐渐提高，今年夏屯进行顺利。至七月底、郏县、郑县、陈留已百分之百的完成，全区平均已完成百分之八十以上。尤其是经过反恶霸斗争的地区，召开了农民代表会，评定了产量，群众情绪空前高涨；未经反恶霸斗争的地区，也都召开了干部会，经过评产量、挤黑地，负担亦较过去公平。在夏屯过程中，有些干部为了急于完成任务，产生了强迫命令的现象，专注意造册子，算负担，而不在群众中进行广泛的宣传教育，使政府的合理负担政策不能贯彻。
    六月中旬以来，豫境陇海路以南三十五县地区，先后发现蝗蝻，重灾区如嵩县境内被害秋苗即达二千余亩，并迅速蔓延至八千亩的地区。各级人民政府一面宣传动员，破除迷信，一面组织群众大力扑蝗。经一个多月的捕剿，仅嵩县十余村庄，即捕捉黄豆大的蝗蝻达四千余斤。受灾各县以村帮村，邻帮邻的办法，终将这一巨大的灾害初步扑灭，并迅速在灾地补种晚秋。
    黄河夏汛期间，水位高涨，由于沿河干部和群众已有充分准备，奋力抢险，均未决口。但洪水泛滥期间，豫省多年失修的汝河、颍河、清泥河、沣河等河流共决口二十余处。七月上旬，汝南、上蔡、西平、涿平四县被淹二十六个村庄，损失耕地十余万亩。许昌一个分区，被淹没村庄三百余个，土地二十五万三千五百余亩，倒塌房屋一万七千余间。经人民政府领导群众大力抢修，排除积水，现大部灾地都已种上晚秋。（新华社开封二十九日电）
