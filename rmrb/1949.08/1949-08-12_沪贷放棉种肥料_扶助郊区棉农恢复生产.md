    Shanghai Issues Loans of Cotton Seeds and Fertilizer
    Assisting Suburban Cotton Farmers in Resuming Production
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th] The Shanghai Cotton Production Improvement Office has issued large quantities of cotton seeds and fertilizer as loans to assist cotton farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai to resume production. Before the liberation of Shanghai, the Kuomintang bandit troops dug fortifications everywhere in the suburbs, causing serious damage to cotton fields. After the liberation of Shanghai, the office immediately loaned more than 200 dan of seeds to cotton farmers in Dachang, Yangxing, and Gucun in the suburbs of Shanghai. In mid-June, it also loaned more than 116,000 jin of ammonium phosphate fertilizer to cotton farmers in ten areas including Wusong, Yangxing, Yuepu, Jiangwan, Zhenru, and Luodian, benefiting more than 152,000 mu of cotton fields. The near-suburban office of the People's Bank of China Shanghai Branch has also decided to first pilot agricultural loans in Longhua, Zhenru, Yangsi and other places to help vegetable farmers purchase fertilizer.
