    Proclamation of the Beiping Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    Proclamation No. 12

    It has been found that recently, public-owned industrial and commercial enterprises, as well as institutions and schools from various regions, have been purchasing goods in this city without complying with the regulations of the North China People's Government, which stipulate that purchases should be made through trade companies. This has allowed unscrupulous merchants to take the opportunity to engage in speculative activities, disrupting the market and significantly impacting prices in this city. To correct this state of anarchy, it is hereby decided that all public-owned enterprises or trade units from various regions, administrative organizations stationed in Beiping, and production departments of various levels of organizations in Beiping, who need to purchase goods in the market of this city, regardless of whether they have already completed the purchase or are preparing to purchase, must register with the Beiping Municipal People's Government Bureau of Industry and Commerce within one week from the date of this proclamation. They must accurately report the types, quantities, and uses of the goods to be purchased, and establish contact with the Beiping Trade Company. Violators will be dealt with according to the law. This is hereby proclaimed.

            Director: Ye Jianying
            August 7th, 38th year of the Republic of China
