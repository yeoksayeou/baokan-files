　　Workers' Summer Night School in the Fifth District Concludes
　　Establish Regular Workers' Night School
　　Thirty-Plus Study Models Awarded
    [Our Newspaper] Under the guidance of the Propaganda and Education Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Fifth District organized three summer night schools for workers. More than 300 workers participated, including those from industries such as manufacturing, transportation, carpet weaving, construction, as well as shop assistants. The initial period of study concluded successfully on the 14th. After democratic discussions among the workers themselves, twenty-five first-class study models and twelve second-class study models were elected. The worker comrades clarified the concept that studying is for themselves and for labor to create the world.
    The Fifth District Federation of Trade Unions Office and the Fifth District Committee held a closing ceremony on the afternoon of the 15th at 8:30 PM. At the meeting, the chairman reported on the process and results of the night school study. Prizes were awarded to those selected as study models. Each of the twenty-five first-class models received a badge, and each of the second-class models received two books and two pencils. Four people received special praise. Huang Futin, a worker at the Yanjing Dyeing and Weaving Factory, studied whenever he had free time. He previously could not read a single character, but now he can read short sentences in the newspaper. Tan Peiren, a worker at the silk weaving factory, asked questions about anything he didn't understand until he fully grasped it. Zhang Xueming, a rickshaw puller, never missed a class and shared what he learned with his neighbors every day. Because the workers unanimously requested to continue their studies, some workers said, "It's so rare to have such an opportunity to study, why is it so short?" In response to the workers' request, the person in charge announced at the meeting that night school would continue without interruption. From then on, the workers' night school would become a regular night school, with each term scheduled for six months. (Lu Hong)

　　五区工人暑期夜校结业
  　办正规工人夜校
  　三十余学习模范受奖
    【本报讯】五区在市总工会宣教部指示下，举办了三个暑期工人夜校，参加学习的工人共有三百余人，包括产业、搬运、地毯、建筑等业工人及店员。最初一段学习于十四日已圆满结束，并经过工人们自己民主的讨论，选举了二十五个头等学习模范，十二个二等学习模范。工友们明确了学习是为了自己和劳动创造世界等观念。
    五区工会办事处、五区区委会特于十五日下午八时半举行了一个结业式。会上由主席报告夜校学习的过程与成果。并发给此次被选为学习模范的奖品。一等模范二十五名，每人得一个奖章，二等模范每人得书二本铅笔二支。并有四人特别受表扬。燕京染织厂的工人黄福庭有了空时间就学习，从前他一个字都不认识，现在可以读报纸上的简短句子了。织罗底工人谭培仁他不懂的就发问，直到完全明白后为止。三轮工人张学明从来没缺过席，并且每天把自己所学的讲给街坊听。由于工人们一致要求继续学习，有的工人说：“好容易有这么个机会学习，怎这么短呀？”负责方面应工人之要求，在会上宣布夜校继续上课，一天也不耽误。此后，工人夜校即成为正规的夜校，预定半年为一期。（路虹）
