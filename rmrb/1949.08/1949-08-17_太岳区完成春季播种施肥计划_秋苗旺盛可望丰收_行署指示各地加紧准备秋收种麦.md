Taiyue District Completes Spring Sowing and Fertilization Plan
  　Bumper Harvest Expected Due to Vigorous Autumn Seedlings
    Administrative Office Directs All Localities to Intensify Preparations for Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting
    [Taiyue Electric] The Taiyue Administrative Office issued instructions to all counties on the 10th of this month regarding autumn agricultural production work. The instructions pointed out: After the land reform was completed and land ownership was determined, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers for production was particularly high. In addition, the reduction of war service tasks and the active leadership and assistance of leading organs and the vast number of cadres at all levels enabled our district to victoriously complete the sowing and fertilization plan this spring. We also expanded arable land by more than 60,000 mu, restored and constructed more than 58,000 mu of paddy fields, and transformed more than 40,000 mu of low-lying wetlands into fertile farmland. The district has increased the purchase of livestock by more than 8,000 head, and the number of repaired and newly added farm implements has reached one-third of the original shortage. After some areas suffered from frost and insect pests, timely efforts were made to rescue crops from frost damage and control insect pests to protect seedlings. Now the seedlings have been weeded twice in general, and some areas have been weeded three times. In addition, the rainfall is generally even, so the seedlings are growing particularly vigorously. If there are no unexpected disasters, a bumper harvest of autumn crops can be expected. In addition to continuing to earnestly implement the work of weeding the seedlings three times, removing diseased seedlings, eliminating pests, and preventing waterlogging, the following should be done:
    First, we must immediately start preparing for wheat planting, plowing the land well and preparing fertilizer. It is required that wheat fields be plowed three times, and an average of 30 to 40 dan of fertilizer be applied per mu. We should also universally mobilize the masses to exchange varieties and adjust wheat seeds well. Vigorously promote warm water seed soaking, chemical seed dressing, oil seed dressing, etc. Before sowing wheat, all localities can re-inspect the wheat seeds. Secondly, we should adapt to local conditions based on climate and soil, and sow at the appropriate time. We must oppose one-sided emphasis on expanding wheat fields, or untimely promotion of early or late sowing.
    Second, we must seize every opportunity before the ground freezes, conscientiously mobilize the masses to accumulate fertilizer, compost manure, organize soil breaking and fertilizer smoking, and carry out green manure movement, in order to prepare sufficient fertilizer for this year's wheat planting and next year's spring plowing. The fertilizer problems of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and cadres' families should be specifically resolved.
    Third, we must lead the masses to do a good job in the autumn harvest, achieving timely harvesting and timely storage, preventing wind and rain damage, and reducing harvest losses. During the autumn harvest, we should universally organize the masses to carry out field seed selection. Cotton should be picked and ginned separately for both large and small foreign cotton and Chinese cotton, in order to maintain pure varieties and pure cotton for the needs of the urban machine textile industry and to prepare excellent pure varieties for next year. "August 1st Grain" seeds should be called upon to be properly preserved and exchanged and promoted in a planned manner. When the autumn harvest arrives, we must mobilize men, women, old and young in a tense manner and organize them into autumn harvest production. We must widely mobilize women to participate in harvesting and threshing. We should also organize and promote the masses to watch the autumn fields, discuss and formulate village covenants, and protect the autumn crops. In mountainous areas, we must organize the masses to hunt in the mountains to prevent wild boars, deer, monkeys, crows, sparrows, and other birds and animals from damaging the crops. At the end of the autumn harvest, we should immediately organize the masses to break the soil in autumn. Last year, the area of autumn soil breaking in the district accounted for about 85% of all autumn fields; this year, war service tasks have been reduced, livestock has increased, and the participation of women in agricultural labor has expanded. It is required to universally break all autumn land once.
    Fourth, all localities should universally pay attention to autumn chick hatching, collecting mountain products, medicinal materials, cutting brambles, and other sideline production.
    In order to successfully complete the above tasks, the instructions also pointed out: the various tasks should be arranged in order of priority and urgency, and should not be arranged all at once without a central focus or priority. We should also study specific implementation methods and steps based on the conditions of each district and village, and should not simply convey the original instructions from higher levels. All localities should seize the opportunity during the agricultural slack season, and under the conditions of not affecting production and the masses' conscious voluntariness, convene small-scale meetings of good mutual aid team leaders, labor heroes, production models, and experienced old farmers, with the county or district as the unit, to summarize and exchange the production experience of the previous stage, summarize the opinions of the masses, and bring them to the masses through their natural activities. Do not treat these people as cadres and let them convey and arrange work to the district and village, which would delay them for more time. In wheat planting, autumn harvesting, and autumn soil breaking, we should continue to mobilize the masses to organize and implement labor mutual assistance, mobilize women to participate in production, and inspect and practically solve the problem of surrogate farming for the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel.

　　太岳区完成春季播种施肥计划
  　秋苗旺盛可望丰收
    行署指示各地加紧准备秋收种麦
    【太岳电】太岳行政公署特于本月十日对各县秋季农业生产工作发出指示，指示中指出：土地改革结束，地权确定后，广大农民群众生产情绪特别高涨，再加上战勤任务的减少及各级领导机关与广大干部的积极领导与帮助，使我区今年春季胜利地完成了播种施肥计划，并扩大耕地六万余亩，恢复和兴修了水田五万八千余亩，而且还将四万余亩下湿地变为肥沃的良田。全区已增购牲口八千余头，修好与增置农具的数目已达到原缺农具的三分之一。部分地区遭受冻灾、虫灾后及时进行了抢救冻灾与灭虫保苗工作。现禾苗已普遍锄过二遍，并有部分地区已锄过三遍，又加雨水一般调匀，所以禾苗长的特别旺盛。如再无意外灾害，秋禾可望丰收。现除仍应切实贯彻锄三遍苗、拔病苗、除害虫、防水冲等工作外应：
    第一、必须立即着手作好种麦的准备工作，要把地犁好，把粪准备好。要求麦田争取犁到三遍，每亩平均上粪三十担到四十担。并普遍发动群众换种，调剂好麦种。大大提倡温汤浸种，药剂拌种，油拌种籽……等。在未种麦之前，各地可将麦种再作一番检查。其次应根据气候土壤，因地制宜，做到适时下种，反对片面的强调扩大麦田，或不适时宜的提倡早种晚种。
    第二、必须抓紧上冻前的各个时机，认真地动员群众积肥、沤粪、组织刹地薰粪，开展压绿肥运动，为今年种麦和明年春耕准备足够的肥料。对烈、军、干属的肥料问题应给以具体解决。
    第三、必须领导群众作好秋收，作到按时收割，按时收藏，防止风磨雨沤，减少收成。在秋禾成熟收割时，应普遍组织群众进行田间选种。棉花将大小洋花及中国花分别摘、轧。保持纯种与纯花，以供城市机器纺织业需用及为明年准备优良纯种。“八一谷”种，应号召妥为保存，并有计划地交换推广。在秋收到来时，必须把男、女、老、幼紧张地动员起来，组织到秋收生产中去。要广泛地发动妇女参加收割、打场。并组织与提倡群众看秋田，议定村公约，保护秋禾。在靠山的地方，要组织群众打山，防止山猪、鹿、猴、乌鸦、麻雀等鸟兽糟害庄稼。在秋收的末期，应紧接着组织群众秋刹地。去年全区秋刹地约占全部秋田的百分之八十五左右；今年战勤任务减少，牲口增加及扩大妇女的参加农业劳动。要求将全部秋地普刹一遍。
    第四、各地应普遍地注意秋季的孵小鸡，采山货、药料，割荆条等副业生产。
    为顺利地完成上述工作，指示中并指出：对各种工作要分别先后缓急，切勿无中心、无先后的一齐往下布置。并应根据各区各村情况，研究出具体实施的办法与步骤，切勿只简单的照上级指示原文往下传达。各地应抓紧农闲空隙，在不影响生产及群众自觉自愿条件下，有准备的以县或区为单位召开小型的好的互助组长及劳动英雄、生产模范与有经验的老农座谈会，以总结与交流前一段的生产经验，把群众中的意见总结起来，又经过他们自然的活动带到群众中去。切勿把这些人当做干部一样让他们到区到村传达、布置工作，耽误他们更多时间。在种麦、秋收、秋刹中，仍应贯彻发动群众组织起来，实行劳动互助与发动广大妇女参加生产，检查与实际解决烈、军属的代耕问题。
