　　【Taiyuan Electric】Responsible persons of the Taiyuan Municipal Military Control Commission Light and Heavy Industry Management Office and the North China Federation of Trade Unions Taiyuan Office, in order to support Shanghai in crushing the imperialist and its running dog Kuomintang remnant forces' blockade of Shanghai, jointly issued a statement saying: "In addition to calling on Taiyuan workers to actively strive to build a new Taiyuan for the people, produce more materials, support the People's Liberation Army to completely eliminate the Kuomintang remnant forces, and support the people of Shanghai in crushing the enemy's blockade, we send a message to the people of all circles in Shanghai: you are not isolated. We, the workers of Taiyuan, have full confidence in supporting the People's Liberation Army and the people of Shanghai. The enemy's blockade of Shanghai will inevitably be completely defeated. We hope that the people of all circles in Shanghai will resolutely respond to the six calls of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, implement the evacuation of personnel and the relocation of some factories and schools in a planned and step-by-step manner, and defeat the enemy's blockade. If you are willing to move to Taiyuan, we welcome you. Taiyuan not only has cheap raw materials for various self-reliant light and heavy industries, but also has an easy life and broad sales channels; especially sales to the northwestern provinces, which is a great and bright future for us. We hope that the worker brothers of Shanghai and the far-sighted industrial, cultural and educational circles of Shanghai will prepare and plan to migrate to Taiyuan as soon as possible, which will not only crush the enemy's blockade of Shanghai, but also promote Shanxi and the Northwest region to move towards the bright future of transforming an agricultural country into an industrial country as pointed out by Chairman Mao.

　　各地欢迎沪产业界内迁
    太原原料充足销路宽广适合沪产业界前往设厂
    太原工业管理处及华北职工总会办事处负责人联合发表谈话
    【太原电】太原市军管会轻重工业管理处及华北职工总会太原办事处负责人，为了支援上海粉碎帝国主义及其走狗国民党残余势力对上海的封锁，联合发表谈话称：“我们除了号召太原职工积极努力建设人民的新太原，生产更多的物资，支援人民解放军彻底消灭国民党残余势力和支援上海人民粉碎敌人封锁外，我们寄语上海各界人民，你们不是孤立的，我们太原职工，对支援人民解放军和上海人民具有充分信心。敌人封锁上海，必将遭到完全失败。希望上海各界人民，坚决响应中共上海市委的六项号召，有计划有步骤地实行疏散人员和实行把部分工厂学校内迁，打垮敌人的封锁。如果你们愿意迁到太原来，我们表示欢迎。太原不仅仅具备各种自力更生的轻重工业的便宜原料，而且生活容易，销路宽广；特别是向大西北各省销售，这是我们很大的一条光明前途。我们希望上海的职工弟兄和上海有远见的产业界和文化教育界人士，及早准备和计划向太原迁移，这样不仅能够粉碎敌人对上海的封锁，而且能够推动山西及西北地区走向毛主席所指出的变农业国为工业国的光明前途。
