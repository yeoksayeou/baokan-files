    [Report from this newspaper] Today, on the anniversary of "August 15th," Guo Moruo, Xiao San, and Yan Baohang, all standing committee members of the Preparatory Committee of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, spoke to our newspaper reporters successively, celebrating the great victory of the Soviet army in assisting the Chinese people to liberate the entire Northeast.
    Guo Moruo: Four years ago, on "August 15th," the Soviet Red Army assisted the Chinese people in liberating the entire Northeast from the long-term fourteen-year occupation of Japanese imperialism by force. This is an expression of the profound friendship of the Soviet people towards us Chinese people. Modern Chinese production and railways account for about 60 percent in the Northeast, making the people's democratic Northeast the main base for building a new people's democratic China. During the war, we relied on Soviet assistance to liberate the Northeast. In the construction period, we must rely even more on Soviet assistance to restore and develop all construction. Recently, when imperialism is blockading us and hindering our construction, the Soviet government signed a one-year trade agreement with the Northeast People's Government, which proves that the Soviet people will wholeheartedly assist us in peaceful construction as well. We are endlessly grateful for Soviet assistance. We must commemorate "August 15th" for a long time, intensify our learning from the Soviet Union, and strive to build a new Northeast and a new China. Commemorating "August 15th" with hard work in construction should be the best way to repay Soviet friendship.
    Xiao San: Regardless of its own exhaustion, after defeating the devil Hitler, the Soviet Union turned its troops eastward and eliminated the most elite Kwantung Army of the Japanese invaders, destroying the breeding ground of war in the East (the breeding ground in the West was in Germany). After rescuing the Western people from fire and water, they also rescued the people of the East, especially the people of China and Korea. This achievement cannot be erased. The Soviet Union's heroic and invincible Red Army and the troops of the Mongolian People's Republic advanced in three routes, forcing the rampant Japanese warlords to surrender unconditionally with the force of thunder in less than a week. Think about how heavy that hammer was: In the West, the Soviet army, in addition to liberating its own territory, also liberated many countries such as Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. In the East, it liberated the entire Northeast, as well as Rehe, Chahar, etc., and also liberated North Korea. In addition to liberating these many people, it also laid a solid foundation for ensuring peace in the Far East and preventing the resurgence of Japanese aggression. The achievements of the Soviet army, the Soviet people, and the great leader Stalin deserve our deep gratitude. Let the warmongers of the new war, American imperialism, and its running dogs, the big and small lackeys Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and Quirino, bark wildly. The eyes of the Chinese and the people of the world are sharp. They can see who is the enemy and who is the friend. Let us consolidate the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!
    Yan Baohang: First, we must have a sufficient understanding of the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to the Northeast in 1945. The Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialism together viciously and shamelessly propagated that the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops was "opportunistic." After the recent publication of the White Paper, the infamous reactionary leader Vandenberg even falsely accused the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops of not playing any role, saying it was "too late," attempting to use this to deceive the Chinese people's understanding of the Soviet Union. Based on the international and domestic war situations and political situations at the time, we Chinese people must firmly point out that the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops was not only necessary but also timely. Second, the recent trade agreement signed between the Soviet Union and China in the Northeast is our plan to export surplus agricultural products (mainly soybeans) to the Soviet Union in order to obtain the machinery and equipment that our country now most needs and cannot easily manufacture itself. This fully complies with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and is a manifestation of the Soviet Union's consistent friendly assistance to China.
    Finally, he specifically pointed out the issue of not allowing the transport of troops to Dalian, which the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialism have been clamoring about and which was also mentioned in the recent "White Paper." He solemnly said: Article 4 of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship regarding the Dalian Agreement states that Dalian should be subject to the military control established in Lushun during the war against Japan, and international law stipulates that the country is still in a state of war until the treaty of peace with the belligerent country is signed. Everyone knows that the reason why the treaty of peace with Japan has not been signed is due to the control of American imperialism. As long as the treaty of peace with Japan has not been concluded, it is fully justified that Dalian should not be allowed to transport troops, just like Lushun. Another more realistic and sufficient reason is that American imperialism is colluding with Chiang Kai-shek to support the resurgence of Japanese fascism and openly declares Japan as a base for aggression. Based on these facts, it proves that their behavior completely violates the spirit of the Yalta Conference, the Potsdam Conference, and the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. And the Soviet Union's facilities in Lushun and Dalian are precisely based on and fulfilling the obligations of the above treaties and conferences, preventing the resurgence of Japanese fascism and safeguarding peace in the Far East. This is absolutely necessary for the Soviet Union and the entire Chinese people. For the sake of the interests of the people of the Far East, we should firmly support it.

    纪念“八一五”伟大节日
    拥护中苏友好同盟条约
    努力建设新中国答谢苏联友谊
    郭沫若等对本报记者发表谈话
    【本报讯】今日“八一五”纪念日，中苏友好协会筹委会常务委员郭沫若、萧三及阎宝航相继对本报记者发表谈话，庆祝苏军协助中国人民解放全东北的伟大胜利。
    郭沫若：四年前的“八一五”，苏联红军协助中国人民武力把全东北从日本帝国主义的十四年长期占领之下解放了。这是苏联人民对于我们中国人民的极深厚的友谊表示。中国的近代生产和铁路，在东北的要占百分之六十左右，因而人民民主的东北是建设人民民主新中国的主要根据地。我们在战争时期既靠着苏联的援助解放了东北，在建设时期尤须靠着苏联的援助恢复并发展一切的建设。最近在帝国主义封锁我们，阻挠我们建设的时候，苏联政府又和东北人民政府签订了一年的贸易协定，这正证明苏联人民，就在和平建设方面，也要全心全意的援助我们。我们对于苏联的援助是感谢不尽的。我们要长久的纪念“八一五”，并加紧向苏联学习，努力新东北和新中国的建设。用努力建设来纪念“八一五”，这应该是报答苏联友谊的最好的途径。
    萧三：苏联过去不顾及自己的疲倦，打垮了混世魔王希特勒以后，又回师东向，消灭日寇最精锐的关东军，打垮了东方的战争温床（西方的温床在德国），在拯救西方人民出了水火之后，又拯救了东方的人民，特别是中国和韩国的人民，这个功劳是不能够磨灭的。苏联英勇无敌的红军和蒙古共和国的部队分三路挺进，以雷霆万钧之威力，不到一个星期，就逼迫猖獗多年的日本军阀俯首贴耳，无条件的投降。你想这一个铁锤是多么重的：苏联的军队在西方除掉解放自己的国土以外，又解放了捷克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利等许多国家，在东方又解放了全东北，以及热河、察哈尔等，同时又解放了北朝鲜。除了解放这许多人民以外，又为保障远东的和平，防止日寇侵略势力的再起，树立了巩固的基础，苏联军队，苏联人民以及伟大领袖斯大林的功劳，是值得我们深深的感谢的。让新战争的挑拨者美帝国主义以及它的走狗、大小喽罗蒋介石、李承晚及季里诺等狺狺狂吠吧，中国和全世界人民的眼睛是雪亮的，看得出谁是敌人，谁是朋友，让我们巩固中苏两国人民的友谊吧！
    阎宝航：第一点我们对于一九四五年苏联的出兵东北要有足够的认识。国民党反动派和美帝国主义一起恶毒无耻地宣传苏联出兵是“投机取巧”，最近美国那篇失败的供状白皮书发表之后，著名的反动头子范登堡还诬蔑苏联出兵没有起什么作用，“为时已晚”，企图以此蒙蔽中国人民对苏联的认识，我们中国人民根据当时国际国内的战争情况和政治情况，一定要坚决指出苏联的出兵不仅是必要而且是及时的。第二点关于最近在东北签订的苏联与中国的贸易协定，是我们有计划地向苏联输出剩余农产品（主要是大豆）以便取得我国现在所最为必需和不易自造的机器和器材，这一点完全符合中苏友好条约，是苏联对中国一贯的友谊协助的表现。
    最后他特别指出国民党反动派和美帝国主义一直在叫嚣而最近“白皮书”上也曾提出的关于大连不准运兵的问题。他郑重地说：中苏友好条约关于大连协定第四条说，大连在对日作战时要服从在旅顺所设立之军事统制，而国际公法上又规定交战国的和约没有签定时则仍属战时状态。对日和约之所以没有签定，谁都知道是由于美帝国主义的控制。只要对日和约还未订立，大连就应与旅顺同样不能允许运兵是有充分根据的。另外更现实的充足理由是美帝国主义与蒋介石的勾结扶植日本法西斯的再起，并公开声明日本为侵略基地。由于以上这些事实，证明他们这种行为是完全违反雅尔达会议，波茨坦会议和中苏友好条约的精神。而苏联在旅顺和大连的设施，正是根据和履行了以上条约和会议的义务，防止日本法西斯的再起，保卫远东的和平，对于苏联和全中国的人民，这是完全必要的。为远东人民自身利益，我们应当坚决拥护。
