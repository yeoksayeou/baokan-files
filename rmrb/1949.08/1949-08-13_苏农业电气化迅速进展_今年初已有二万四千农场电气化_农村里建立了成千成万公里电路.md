Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: Moscow dispatch: The electrification of Soviet agriculture is progressing rapidly. In the current period of gradual transition from socialism to communism, electrification and tractors are two powerful levers for agricultural technological construction. Electricity has replaced a large amount of heavy manual labor, and has become the most important factor in universally improving agricultural production, constantly increasing the happiness of agricultural laborers. In the past year, Soviet collective farms saved 98 million man-days of labor due to the electrification of major production processes.

Now, the Soviet Union is developing agricultural electrification on a particularly large scale. Before the war, in 1940, the power of agricultural power stations was only 275,000 kilowatts, but the post-war Five-Year Plan stipulates that by next year (1950), it will increase to 2 million kilowatts. Next year, more than 3 billion "kilowatt-hours" of electricity will be used in agriculture. All state farms, machine and tractor stations, and 56,000 collective farms will be electrified. At the beginning of this year, 24,000 collective farms had been electrified, and the number of electric motors used in rural areas had increased to 56,000. Thousands upon thousands of kilometers of circuits have been established in rural areas. In addition to small power stations, large power stations are now under construction. For example, the Lysen region built a hydroelectric power station with 1,000 kilowatts of power last year, supplying electricity to 40 collective farms. This year, a 2,000-kilowatt power station is being built, which can supply electricity to 136 collective farms. In addition, many hydroelectric power stations are being built for collective farms on the Oka River in the Orel region, and rural power stations are being built throughout the country.

    苏农业电气化迅速进展
    今年初已有二万四千农场电气化
    农村里建立了成千成万公里电路
    【新华社北平十二日电】莫斯科讯：苏联农业电气化正迅速进展中。在目前从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的时期中，电气化和拖拉机是农业技术建设的两个强有力的杠杆。电力代替了大量繁重的人力劳动，已成为普遍提高农业生产的最主要的因素，使农业劳动人民的幸福不断上升。去年一年当中，苏联各集体农场由于主要生产过程的电气化，就节省了九千八百万个人工的人力劳动。
    现在，苏联正以特别巨大的规模发展农业电气化。战前一九四○年时，农业电力站的电力，仅有二十七万五千千瓦，但是，战后五年计划规定，到明年（一九五○年）时，就将增加到二百万千瓦，明年一年中农业使用的电力将在三十亿“千瓦时”以上。所有的国营农场、机器与拖拉机站，和五万六千个集体农场，都将电气化。在今年年初时，已有两万四千个集体农场电气化，农村所使用的电动机的数目已增加到五万六千个。农村里已建立了成千成万公里的电路。除了小电力站以外，现在正建设大电力站。例如，利森州去年已建立了一座有一千千瓦电力的水电站，供给四十个集体农场的电力，今年又正在建立一个二千千瓦的发电站，这个发电站的电力可供给一百三十六个集体农场。此外，奥勒尔州的俄喀河上，正为集体农场建立着许多水电站，全国各地也正建立着农村发电站。
