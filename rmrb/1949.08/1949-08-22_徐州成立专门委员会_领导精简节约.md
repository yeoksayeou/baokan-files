Xuzhou Establishes Special Committee to Lead Streamlining and Thrift

[Xuzhou News] The Xuzhou Municipal People's Government recently established a special committee to uniformly lead the streamlining work of all its subordinate units. The committee requires each unit to ensure that every comrade recognizes the importance of streamlining; and understands the need to reduce redundant and bloated organs and tighten financial expenditures in order to overcome the current temporary economic difficulties. The committee also formulated general streamlining principles: 1. Telephones: Each bureau will only have one, and departments should not add more except in special circumstances. 2. Electricity for lighting in dormitories: in addition to one lamp per bureau chief, section chiefs can have one lamp for every two people, and collective dormitory residents can have one lamp per room (10 to 20 candlepower). 3. Major city newspapers will be uniformly ordered by the municipal government. 4. Vehicles, horses, etc. of various departments will be uniformly dispatched by the Secretariat and the Finance and Food Bureau. 5. Streamline non-productive service personnel; younger ones will go to school to study, and young adults will go to the guard troops or factories to work. Cadres who are made redundant are planned to be assigned to rural areas or to work in enterprise departments. Work has now begun.

　　徐州成立专门委员会
  　领导精简节约
    【徐州讯】徐州市人民政府近成立了专门的委员会统一领导所辖各单位的精简工作。该委会要求各单位必须使每个同志认识到精简的重要性；及为克服目前暂时的经济困难，必须减少机关冗员臃肿现象，紧缩财政开支的道理。该委员会并拟定了一般的精简原则：一、电话机，每局只设一部，科除特别需要外，均不得增设。二、宿舍内用的电灯除局长每人一盏外，科长可二人一盏，住集体宿舍者每屋一盏（十度至二十度光）。三、各大城市的报纸由市府统一订购。四、各部门车辆、马匹等，交秘书处及财粮局统一调度。五、精简脱离生产的勤杂人员，年纪小的到学校学习，青壮年到警卫部队或工厂去工作，对编余的干部拟定分配到农村或到企业部门工作。现已着手进行。
