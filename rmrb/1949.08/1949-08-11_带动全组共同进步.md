Leading the Whole Group to Progress Together

At the beginning of the study group, Shi Youhua's group was doing very poorly. The dormitory was a mess, and when the group held meetings, everyone just stared blankly without saying a word. He was the only member of the Communist Youth League in the group, and a League member should play a leading role among the masses. However, he usually didn't like to talk; he was also the youngest, only fourteen years old this year. When he thought about being a League member, he became even more anxious and embarrassed. But because he was a League member, it also gave him infinite courage and perseverance. He thought and thought, and the best way he could think of was to start with himself.

He would get up early, while his classmates were still sound asleep, and clean the dormitory, arranging the washbasins and shoes neatly. When his classmates woke up and saw that he had already tidied up the dormitory, they felt embarrassed to throw things around casually anymore. After the classmates studied "Labor Creates the World," they understood that to transform themselves and serve the people, it was very important to cultivate their labor perspective through action. Many classmates voluntarily went to clean the dining hall and toilets. Shi Youhua felt that the yard was very dirty and the rooms were very damp, and that it was necessary to have a cleanliness campaign. So he discussed it with everyone, and he took the lead in removing the sewage from the yard. Then the classmates were all mobilized, and everyone sang happily, and the yard was cleaned up in no time. The classmates saw the results of their labor and couldn't help but jump up with joy. They didn't even take a nap and brought out their quilts and straw mats to air them. Everyone held a meeting in the clean yard, feeling very happy, and slept even more comfortably at night.

After this cleanliness campaign, everyone felt that collective life was quite pleasant and meaningful; at the same time, everyone gradually became more harmonious. So Shi Youhua said to his classmates during a casual chat, "If we do a good job in group study, our life will be more pleasant and meaningful." The classmates felt that he was right, but what should they do if they had nothing to say when they held meetings? He thought that this was because they were not prepared, could not find problems, and did not connect with their own thoughts. He suggested that they prepare more before the meeting, and he himself tried to prepare as much as possible, thinking of some questions to raise. Later, at the meetings, he himself first tried to speak, and also raised some questions to induce those students who did not like to speak to talk. His attitude was so humble and sincere that every classmate felt ashamed and admired. Everyone gradually spoke one after another, unconsciously moving from silence to discussion.

Later, Shi Youhua felt that although the group meetings had become lively, most of the speeches were guilty of dogmatism, and sometimes they even circled around some trivial issues without connecting to their own thoughts at all. After listening to several reports, he knew that to connect with his own thoughts, he must first expose his own thoughts. So at the group meeting, he boldly spoke out his incorrect motives for coming to the study group: "In the past, I was detached from the masses in school. I came to the study group simply to learn a set of methods so that I could improve my relations with the masses in the future. After listening to several reports, I knew that to serve the people well, I needed to completely transform myself. The previous idea of learning a set of 'magic weapons' was completely wrong." The classmates in the group saw that Shi Youhua was so young and also bravely spoke about his wrong thoughts, so everyone boldly criticized and self-criticized, and the group study thus improved a step further.

Shi Youhua played a leading role in the group in this way, leading the group and leading everyone to progress together.

    带动全组共同进步
    学习团开始的时候，史幼华的一个小组搞得很不好，寝室里乱糟糟的，小组里开起会来，大家瞪着眼坐着一声也不响。他是小组里唯一的青年团团员，团员应该在群众里起带头作用，但是他平日不爱说话；他年纪又最轻，今年刚十四岁。当他想到他是一个团员时，他便更焦急，更为难；然因为他是个团员也就更给他无限的勇气和毅力。他想来想去，想到最好的办法是从自己做起。
    他清早就在同学的酣睡中爬起来，把寝室打扫干净，把面盆鞋子都摆得整整齐齐；同学们醒来，看见他已经把寝室收拾好了，以后大家也不好意思把东西随便扔了。同学们在学习了劳动创造世界以后，了解到要改造自己，为人民服务，从行动中锻炼自己的劳动观点是很重要的，好些同学自动的去打扫了膳厅和厕所。史幼华感觉院子里很脏，屋子里很潮，很有来一次整洁运动的必要，他于是同大家商量了一下，自己首先动手清除院子里的污水，接着同学都动员起来，大家愉快地唱着歌，一下子把院子弄干净了。同学们看到自己劳动的成绩，不禁高兴得跳起来，连午睡也不睡，把被子，草席都搬出来晒了。大家在干净的院子里开会，觉得十分愉快，晚上也睡得更舒服。
    经过这次整洁运动，大家感觉得集体生活是挺愉快，挺有意思的；同时大家也就慢慢融洽起来了。于是史幼华在漫谈时和同学说：“假使我们把小组学习搞好，我们的生活会过得更愉快，更有意思些。”同学们觉得他说得很对，但是开起会来没有话说怎么办？他想这是没有准备，不能发现问题，不去联系自己思想的缘故。他提议在开会前，多多准备一下，他自己事先也尽量准备，想好一些问题提出来。以后开会他自己首先勉强试着发言，而且提出一些问题来，诱导那些不爱发言的同学讲话。他的态度是那么谦虚，诚恳，使得每个同学都感觉又惭愧、又钦佩。大家渐渐相继讲话，不自觉的由缄默而讨论起来了。
    随后史幼华觉得小组会虽然开得活泼起来，但发言多半是犯了教条主义的毛病，有时候甚至于老在一些枝节问题上绕圈子，根本没有联系到自己的思想。他听了几次报告以后，知道要联系到自己的思想，首先就要暴露自己的思想，他于是在小组会上，首先大胆地把自己到学习团来，不正确的动机说出来：“我过去在学校里脱离群众，我到学习团来，就是单纯的为了学一套法子，以后好把群众关系搞好。听了几次报告以后，我知道要好好地为人民服务，需要完全改造自己才成，以前那种学一套‘法宝’的想法完全错了。”小组里的同学看到史幼华这样小小的年纪，也勇敢说到自己错误的思想，于是大家也就大胆地批评和自我批评起来，小组学习因此又提高了一步。
    史幼华就这样在小组里起了带头作用，带动小组，带动大家共同进步。
