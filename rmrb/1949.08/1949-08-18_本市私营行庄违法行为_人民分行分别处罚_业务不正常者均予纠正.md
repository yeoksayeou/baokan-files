    [Reported by Our Newspaper] The People's Bank of Beiping Branch has imposed penalties or corrections on twenty private banks and firms in Beiping, including Dade Tong and Quan Ju Hou Qian Zhuang, for illegal activities or irregular business operations. In order to understand the business operations of private banks and firms in Ping, and their compliance with financial policies and regulations, the bank mobilized forty cadres on July 20th to form twenty groups. These groups selected eight banks with relatively busy businesses in the city, including Jin Cheng, Yanye, Dalu, Zhongfu, Zhejiang Xingye, Da Zhong, Lianhe Shangye, and Zhongnan, as well as twelve Qian Zhuang including Housheng, Fushunde, Yiju, Chunhe, Derunxing, Yongzeng, Jinhongyu, Hengxing, Tongyuanxiang, Quanjuhou, Dadetong, and Qianxing for key investigation. The investigation was completed on the 25th, and after the bank sorted out and summarized the situation in early August, it was found that Dade Tong Qian Zhuang had illegal activities of reselling gold and has been transferred to the court for handling. Other banks and firms involved in concealing back-account materials or having irregular business operations were given punishments such as criticism, warning, and probation in early August according to the seriousness of the circumstances, as follows: (1) Dade Tong Qian Zhuang had illegal activities of reselling gold. During the bank's inspection, the Municipal Public Security Bureau investigated and found human and material evidence on the spot, and the entire case was transferred to the People's Court for handling. (2) Those who concealed and illegally disposed of back-account materials or were suspected of having back accounts included: Quanjuhou, Derunxing, Housheng, and Chunhe Qian Zhuang. Quanjuhou was given a warning and probation for failing to report back-account materials and was ordered to immediately settle and report. Derunxing's back-account flour has been ordered to be transferred to the formal account and given a warning. Housheng was found to have made loans with gold as collateral and concealed and illegally disposed of back-account materials, and was given a warning and probation, and its materials in Shanghai should be settled and reported. Although Chunhe's back account has been settled, it was not reported, and a warning was given. (3) Jin Cheng Bank's West Branch and Yiju Qian Zhuang have absorbed public funds. In addition to ordering the deposits to be transferred to the People's Bank, the two banks and firms were criticized. (4) Irregular business operations include: (1) Insufficient funds, often relying on borrowed funds to compensate, such as Yongzeng Qian Zhuang. (2) Loan customers mutually guarantee or linked number guarantee, such as Fushunde, Yongzeng, Tongyuanxiang, Housheng, Yiju Qian Zhuang, and Zhongfu, Lianhe Shangye banks. (3) Cashing checks on the same day, such as Yongzeng, etc. (4) Overdrafts exceeding the limit, such as Zhejiang Xingye, Lianhe Shangye, Zhongfu, Yanye four banks, Derunxing, Tongyuanxiang, Dade Tong Qian Zhuang, etc. (5) Insufficient cash reserve, such as Derunxing, Qianxing, Tongyuanxiang, Yiju, Quanjuhou, Chunhe Qian Zhuang, Lianhe Shangye, Da Zhong, Yanye banks.

(13) Establishing fake accounts to misappropriate funds, such as Hengxing Qian Zhuang. (5) Irregular accounting procedures include: Yongzeng Qian Zhuang's accounting director is not responsible, and the audit replaces the accounting duties, making the organization redundant and the responsibilities unclear. Derunxing, Tongyuanxiang, Yiju, and Hengxing Qian Zhuang did not establish a transfer journal. Derunxing's account books omitted entries. Derunxing, Tongyuanxiang, Fushunde, Jin Cheng, Hengxing, Dade Tong, Housheng Qian Zhuang, and other banks and firms have incomplete or altered amounts on vouchers, as well as scraped or erased account books and incomplete filling of account book contracts.
