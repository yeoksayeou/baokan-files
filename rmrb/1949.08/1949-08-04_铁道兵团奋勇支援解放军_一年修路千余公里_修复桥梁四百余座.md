    Railway Engineering Corps Bravely Supports the People's Liberation Army
    Over 1,000 Kilometers of Roads Built, Over 400 Bridges Repaired in One Year
    [Report from this newspaper] The Railway Engineering Corps has achieved excellent results in the construction of the People's Railways over the past year, repairing over 1,000 kilometers of railways and over 400 bridges. From July 1948 to July 1949, the officers, soldiers, and technical personnel of the Railway Engineering Corps fought on the vast front and rear areas. Through their arduous struggle and heroic sacrifice, in coordination with all the railway workers and the broad masses along the lines, and through joint efforts, the People's Railways traversed countless mountains, rivers, towns, and villages from the Northeast to the South of the Yangtze River, ensuring a steady flow of manpower, guns, ammunition, and food supplies to the front lines; and facilitating the exchange of goods between cities and cities, and cities and rural areas. Under the slogan of "Repair wherever we fight," the officers, soldiers, and technical personnel of the Railway Engineering Corps rushed to repair the Shenyang-Jilin Railway, Jilin-Changchun Railway, Jinzhou-Gubei Railway, Changchun-Binjiang Railway, Dalian-Zhengjiatun Railway, Gaoxin Railway, Xinmin-Yixian Railway, Beining Railway, Jinpu Railway, Pinghan Railway, and Longhai Railway, repairing 918 kilometers of main lines and 100 kilometers of sidings. The soldiers of the People's Railway Engineering Corps worked day and night in temperatures as low as minus 40 degrees Celsius, braving blizzards, torrential rains, or enemy aircraft strafing, and persevered in their work. The soldiers displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm when repairing railways. For example, the 4th Detachment created a record of repairing six to seven kilometers per day when repairing the Chencang section of the Jinpu Railway, and the 3rd Detachment completed the construction of the Bengbu Bridge two months ahead of the three-month plan. They overcame all difficulties in their work to ensure that the railway opened to traffic as soon as possible.
    Within one year, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Detachments repaired thirty-three bridges on the Changbin Railway, twenty-two on the Shenchang Railway, sixteen on the Changtu Railway, three on the Gaoxin Railway, twenty on the Xinyi Railway, nine on the Shenji Railway, seven on the Jingu Railway, thirty-five on the Beining Railway, sixty-one on the Pinghan Railway, and two hundred and sixty-seven on the Jinpu Railway, totaling over four hundred bridges with one thousand two hundred and eighty-six spans. The Songhua River Railway Bridge on the Changchun-Taolai Zhao section, which is 669 meters long, was destroyed by the Chiang bandits for 180 meters. The 3rd Detachment completed the repair in three months. Comrade Chen Yun praised the completion of the Songhua River Railway Bridge, saying, "The completion of this railway bridge is a victory road for the people of Northeast China, repaired by all comrades of our 3rd Detachment under the leadership of the Communist Party, working day and night for three months." The Jilin River Railway Bridge on the Changtu Railway, which was destroyed by the enemy for over 240 meters, was successfully completed and opened to traffic from September 7th to November 7th, coinciding with the complete liberation of Northeast China. In this bridge repair, 287 meritorious individuals emerged. When the Northeast People's Liberation Army poured into the interior, the detachment quickly repaired 35 railway bridges on the Beining Railway, accelerating the liberation of the people of Beijing and Tianjin; the officers and soldiers of the Railway Engineering Corps, following the victory of the People's Liberation Army, rushed to repair over 300 bridges on the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways. The historically significant Huai River Railway Bridge on the Jinpu Railway was quickly completed with the assistance of the 3rd Detachment and the local people. The heroic People's Railway warrior and diving hero Wang Jizhen worked in the turbulent waters of the Huai River for five hours, and he gloriously sacrificed himself for the success of the Bengbu Bridge, forever immortalized in the history of the people. The completion of this bridge not only supported the front lines but also strengthened the connection between Shanghai, the largest commercial port in China, and Beijing, the political center of the country, and facilitated the exchange of goods between the North and the South. The completion of over 1,000 kilometers of lines and over 400 bridges is the most valuable contribution of all comrades of the Railway Engineering Corps to the construction of the People's Railways, and it is striving to carry out the arduous and glorious task of building lines and bridges.

    一年内，一、二、三、四支队修复桥长滨线有三十三座，沈长线二十二座，长图线十六座，高新线三座，新义线二十座，沈吉线九座，锦古线七座，北宁线三十五座，平汉线六十一座，津浦线二百六十七座，共四百余座，桥孔一千二百八十六孔。长春至陶赖昭段的松花江大铁桥，全长六百六十九公尺曾为蒋匪破坏一百八十公尺，第三支队在三个月内就修成了，陈云同志在松花江大铁桥胜利竣工时称赞这座大桥的落成说：“此铁桥之修成是我第三支队所有同志在共产党领导下，三个月日日夜夜的紧张工作为东北人民修复了一条胜利之路。”长图线上的吉林江铁桥，为敌人破坏二百四十余公尺，自九月七日至十一月七日随着东北全部解放而胜利的竣工通车了，在这次修桥中出现了二百八十七名功臣。当东北人民解放军涌进关内的时候，支队很快的将北宁线上三十五座铁桥修成了，加速了平津人民的解放；铁道兵团的指战员们，随着人民解放军的胜利在平汉、津浦两线上抢修了三百余座桥梁，津浦线上有历史意义的淮河大铁桥在第三支队及当地人民的协助之下亦很快的完成了，英勇的人民铁道战士潜水英雄王吉珍在急湍的淮河水中工作达五个钟头最后他光荣的为人民历史永垂不朽的蚌埠大桥的成功而牺牲了。这座大桥的完成不仅支援了前线并加强了中国最大商埠——上海与全国政治中心北平之间的连系，沟通了南北的物资交流，千余公里线路与四百余座桥梁的修成，这是铁道兵团全体同志对人民铁道的建设最有价值的贡献，它并正在为努力执行艰巨而光荣的修建线路与桥梁的任务而奋斗。
