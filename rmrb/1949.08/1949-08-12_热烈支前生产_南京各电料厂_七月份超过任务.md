    Enthusiastically Supporting the Front Through Production
    Nanjing's Electrical Material Factories
    Exceed July's Targets
    [This Newspaper News] Nanjing News: Workers at Nanjing's Electric Light Factory, Wire Telephone Factory, and Radio Factory, amidst the struggle against the blockade and in support of the southward advance of the army, worked day and night to actively produce, victoriously exceeding July's production plans and completing military supply tasks. The Electric Light Factory's original plan for July was 20,000 light bulbs, but they completed 24,185. In order to further increase production, the factory will recall workers from the light bulb workshop that was disbanded by the Kuomintang bandit gang before liberation, and has drafted a production plan for this month of 40,000 light bulbs. The Wire Telephone Factory's target for July was to produce 400 exchange components, but they completed 570, and assembled 10 telephone exchanges (30-line sets, 5 units; 25-line sets, 5 units).
    The state-owned Radio Factory, after coordinating with a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on July 20th, completed 17 sets of transceiver radios on August 3rd. After the military representative, factory director, engineers, technicians, and worker representatives jointly held a production symposium to study how to complete this urgent task, they made a plan to complete the task on schedule. On the 24th of last month, workers began a sprint on this work, and on the 3rd of this month, they victoriously completed the task. The main reasons for being able to complete the task on schedule: on the one hand, the efforts of the workers; on the other hand, the close coordination of various departments. In addition to working nine hours a day, workers also worked half or full days on Sundays, and some workers worked overtime for three hours at night. Many engineers worked 12 hours a day for a week straight, and patiently guided trainees and workers. Engineer Director Li Fengxian, in addition to designing all day, twisted screws with the apprentices. Zhou Qinnan, a helper in the radio group, had a very bad fever, but insisted on working without asking for leave, completing the work he was supposed to do in a day. In terms of work coordination: a unified design method was adopted. The factory was divided into six groups, each with a team leader. In order to prevent the work from being uneven and affecting the overall plan, it was decided that Xue Peiyu, an assistant engineer from the fourth group, would be responsible for the unified design, so that the work steps were very coordinated. For example, if the fourth group did not have time to connect the wires, the fifth group would be assigned to do the wiring work. All groups were able to work simultaneously. If a certain group was slightly slower, they would be immediately notified to work overtime to catch up.

### 热烈支前生产  南京各电料厂  七月份超过任务

    热烈支前生产
    南京各电料厂
    七月份超过任务
    【本报讯】南京消息：南京市电照厂、有线电厂、无线电厂职工在进行反封锁斗争及支援大军南进中，日以继夜地积极生产，胜利超过七月份的生产计划及完成军需任务。电照厂七月份原定计划为灯泡两万只，结果完成了二万四千一百八十五只。为了再把产量提高，该厂将招回解放前被国民党匪帮解散的灯泡工场工人，并拟好本月份的生产计划为灯泡四万只。有线电厂七月份预定制成交换组件四百门，结果完成五百七十门，并装成十部交换机（三十门五部，二十五门五部）。
    公营无线电厂于七月二十日与解放军某部接妥在八月三日完成十七套收发报机。该厂经过军事代表、厂长、工程师、技工、职工代表联合举行生产座谈会，研究如何完成这一紧急任务后，作出了按期完成任务的计划。上月二十四日，工人们开始突击此项工作，本月三日即胜利完成任务。能够如期完成任务的主要原因：一方面是职工的努力，另方面是各部门工作的密切配合。职工们除每天工作九小时外，星期日还加工半天或整天，并有一部分工人在晚上加班三小时。不少工程师，每天工作十二小时，连续了一个礼拜，还是耐心地指导练习生和工人工作。工程师主任李凤贤除整天设计外，并和小工一块扭螺丝钉。收音机组帮工周勤南发烧得很利害，硬撑着工作不请假，完成他一天应完成的工作。在工作配合方面：采取了统一设计办法，该厂共分六组，每组设有组长，为了使工作不致或前或后，而影响整个计划，特决定由四组助理工程师薛沛瑜统一设计，使工作步骤非常协调。如四组来不及接线，即分配五组做接线工作。各组工作都能同时并进。某组稍慢，即可马上通知他们加夜班赶上。
