    Found the Key to Learning
    First Stage of Party Training Class Concludes
    Jin Feng
    Since its opening on the 15th of last month, the Communist Party of China's Beiping Municipal Committee School Party Training Class, students have been earnestly engaged in enthusiastic learning. The first stage of learning, covering historical materialism and on the people's democratic dictatorship, has concluded, and it is now entering the second stage of learning, covering the Party Program, the self-cultivation of Party members, and the work of school branches.
    The Party Training Class students include Party members with different identities from 57 universities and middle schools in Beiping, such as students, professors, teaching assistants, staff, middle school teachers, doctors, and nurses, as well as some Youth League members and a small number of progressive masses, totaling approximately 700 people, divided into six branches, with five groups in each branch, serving as the basic organizational unit for life and study. Generally, the students are seeking progress and want to study Marxism-Leninism to establish a communist worldview and outlook on life. However, some had a vague understanding of the learning methods, thinking that it was just to attend large lectures, listen to reports from responsible comrades in the Party, and hard-core study the thick books of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. After Comrade Liu Ren of the CPC Beiping Municipal Committee and Comrade Xiang Ziming of the Party Training Class explained that the purpose of learning is to use the weapon of Marxism-Leninism to transform oneself, and that the learning methods emphasize self-study, discussion, repeated reflection, and connecting with actual thinking, Comrade Xiang Ziming further called on Party members to clarify that studying in the Party Training Class is a task given by the Party to Party members to train themselves, improve themselves, strengthen their Party spirit, and cultivate themselves into good Party members. Based on this, the students launched a casual discussion and examined and criticized their motives for joining the class, and as a result, the learning enthusiasm generally increased.
    However, when actually entering the study, the group discussions did not know how to connect with reality. Everyone just moved a set of terms from the book, did not connect with thinking, could not raise questions, and could not solve problems. Later, under the leadership's promotion of self-study and mutual assistance methods, mutual assistance groups were formed in each study group to read and talk together, solve difficult terms and branch problems, and raise questions, which were concentrated in the group for discussion, connected with everyone's actual thinking, and excavated the roots of thinking. They then rose from actual thinking to theoretical principles, thereby deepening their understanding of the theory and solving some ideological problems. After the branch meeting discussed, and at the end of the study of this course, a specialist was invited to answer questions. For example, Comrade Ai Siqi answered questions about the history of social development, enabling the students to establish or clarify their class viewpoints and labor viewpoints, and materialist viewpoints. Comrade Zhao Zhensheng answered questions on "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," enabling the students to understand the true meaning of democracy and dictatorship, and clarify their views on international issues.
    In addition, due to the fact that during the underground work period, it was impossible to openly carry out education in Party life, Party members did not understand the Party Constitution and Party life well enough. Therefore, in coordination with political study, practical education on Party organizational life was also carried out.
    The Party Training Class is intensive, with nine and a half hours of study every day. The students feel very happy and have reported that this is finding the key to learning. In the past, learning was limited to the literal understanding in the books, and there was very little connection with actual thinking, but now it is beginning to connect with reality, connect with thinking, and learn a little bit at a time. They hope that the learning time can be extended.

    找到了学习的钥匙
    党训班第一阶段学习结束
    金凤
    中共北平市委会学校党员训练班自上月十五日开学以来，学员认真的展开热烈学习。第一阶段唯物史观、论人民民主专政的学习已告结束，现正进入第二阶段党纲、党员修养及学校支部工作的学习。
    党训班学员包括平市五十七个大、中学校的学生、教授、讲助教、职员、中小学教员、医生、护士等身份不同的党员及一部分青年团员和少数进步群众，共约七百余人，分为六个支部，每个支部五个小组，作为生活及学习的基层组织。学员人学一般是要求进步，要求学习马列主义理论，以建立共产主义的世界观和人生观。但有一部分对于学习方法认识模糊，以为就是来上大课，听党内负责同志的报告及硬啃马恩列斯的厚本书等。经中共北平市委刘仁同志及党训班项子明同志先后说明学习的目的在于运用马列主义的武器改造自己，学习方法着重自学、讨论、反复深思、联系实际思想；项子明同志并进一步号召党员要明确在党训班学习是党给予党员锻炼自己、提高自己，以加强党性，培养自己成为一个好党员的任务。学员据此展开漫谈，并检查批判了入学动机，学习情绪因此普遍高涨。
    但在实际进入学习时，小组讨论不知如何联系实际。各人只是搬弄一套书上的名词，不会联系思想，提不出问题，也解决不了问题。后由领导上推行自学、互助办法，在各学习小组中组成互助小组，一起阅读、漫谈，解决了难懂的名词和枝节问题，并提出问题，集中到小组进行讨论，联系各人思想实际，挖掘思想根源，再从实际思想提高到理论原则，由此加深对理论的了解并解决一部分思想问题。又经支部大会讨论，并在最后结束此一课程学习时，请专人解答问题。如社会发展史由艾思奇同志解答，使学员树立了或明确了阶级观点和劳动观点，唯物观点。“论人民民主专政”由赵振声同志解答，使学员明白了民主与专政的确实意义，澄清了对国际问题的看法。
    此外，由于过去在地下工作时期，不能公开进行党内生活的教育，因此党员对于党章及党内生活了解十分不够，因此，配合政治学习，又进行了关于党内组织生活的实际教育。
    党训班学习紧张，每天学习九个半小时。学员感觉十分愉快，并纷纷反映这是找到了学习的钥匙，过去学习只限于书本上字面上的了解，与实际思想结合很少，现在则是开始联系实际，联系思想，学一点是一点。他们希望学习时间能够延长。
