　　Ping Shi News: The headquarters of the China Democratic League yesterday (23rd) issued a "Condemnation of the U.S. Imperialist White Paper," the full text of which is as follows:

　　After reading the "United States Relations with China" White Paper published by the reactionary Truman government of the United States on August 5, we only came to one conclusion: The United States has continued to invade China for the past 100 years; it has intensified its aggression against China in the past five years; and today it is deliberately planning further aggression against China. The original intention of the Truman government in publishing this White Paper was of course to cover up this fact, but the result was the opposite, making the above fact even clearer. Now we will use the materials in the White Paper and Acheson's letters and talks about the White Paper to prove our conclusion and expose this sinister and vicious conspiracy of American imperialism.

　　In the first chapter of the White Paper, "A Century of American Policy," General Editor Jessup painstakingly described Sino-American relations over the past century as so glorious and beautiful, as if China would have been divided long ago fifty years ago if it had not met the United States, this "moral" friend. The White Paper painstakingly explained that "Open Door," "Equal Opportunity," "Most Favored Nation" clauses, etc., are the U.S.'s "opposition to any foreign interference in China's internal affairs." In fact, it would be better not to say this, but saying it exposes the invaders even more. At the end of the 19th century, the United States was a rising star of imperialism. At that time, seeing that other imperialists had already taken the lead in China and each had delineated their spheres of influence, it hurriedly caught up and proposed a method of dividing the spoils in China under the "Equal Opportunity" principle to the powers. This is the source of the U.S. imperialist "Open Door" policy towards China. The so-called "Most Favored Nation" clause is precisely the implementation of "Equal Opportunity." This is the most humiliating provision in all the unequal treaties imposed on China over the past century. The U.S. had a clever President Monroe, who announced the "Monroe Doctrine" for the United States, tightly closing its own door. The United States also produced a clever Secretary of State John Hay, who stipulated the "Open Door" policy for China, forcing China to always open its door. The United States closed its own door, but forced China to always "open the door to welcome thieves." The United States said that this is its "maintenance of China's sovereignty and political independence," a major principle. According to this "maintenance" policy, the U.S. imperialists have enjoyed all kinds of privileges in China, such as concessions, extraterritoriality, inland river navigation, etc. Since World War I, the United States has surpassed other imperialist invaders and robbers. The U.S. imperialists then wanted to move from "Equal Opportunity" to "Sole Possession" in China, and from "Sole Possession" to making China its exclusive semi-colony or full colony. This is the "glorious and beautiful" history of Sino-American relations in the mouth of the U.S. imperialists over the past century. What a "glorious" and beautiful history!

　　The fact of U.S. imperialist aggression against China in the past century is like this. In the past five years (1944-1949), U.S. imperialist aggression against China has become even more intensified. It started when Japan surrendered in 1945 and China's War of Resistance against Japan ended in victory. As a result of World War II, the three imperialist powers of Germany, Italy and Japan were defeated miserably, which strengthened the U.S. imperialists' ambition to dominate the world. After Roosevelt's death, Truman came to power. This right-wing president, who was promoted by the American capitalist class, determined an anti-Soviet and anti-communist national policy in order to protect the interests of the American capitalist class. In order to realize this national policy, Truman held gold in one hand and an atomic bomb in the other, looking down on the world, determined to control the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In order to realize this anti-Soviet and anti-communist policy, it was necessary to control our China in the Pacific. From the perspective of the U.S. imperialists, China should become its exclusive colony. In any case, the United States must grasp the people and land of China as a tool for anti-Soviet and anti-communist purposes, and must not allow China to revive, let alone allow the progressive forces of the Chinese people to rise. Understanding this conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists makes it easy to understand all the anti-people and anti-progressive disruptive behaviors of the U.S. imperialists in China in the past five years. The complete materials confessed by the U.S. imperialists in the White Paper prove the above premise.

　　In the past five years, Hurley, Marshall, Wedemeyer and others have come to China one after another, and Stuart served as ambassador. They have only one common and unique mission, which is to tightly control China, grasp this exclusive semi-colony, and make it a base for realizing the U.S. imperialist anti-Soviet and anti-communist national policy. The rich materials in the White Paper make this clear. The U.S. imperialists need not quibble today; we need not have any doubts. Hurley came to China, simple and clear, because the U.S. was "concerned about the deteriorating situation of the Kuomintang" and its inability to fight the Communist Party politically and militarily in the future. Most noteworthy is what the White Paper says about the three paths the U.S. had to choose regarding its China policy when peace came. The second path was "large-scale military intervention. To help the Kuomintang to destroy the Communist Party." Here, the true face of the U.S. imperialists is revealed. The deceptive words in the first chapter of the White Paper, which vigorously promoted "opposition to foreign interference in China," now openly utter the words "intervention." Why did the U.S. imperialists dare not openly take the road of participating in the Chinese civil war? Because the Jiang government "performed deplorably and perhaps only the strength of the United States could drive away the Communist Party." The Truman government did not consider that this approach might arouse the opposition of the Chinese people, and he feared that "the American people would obviously not agree." In fact, the third path is even more sinister and vicious than the second path. The third path is the practice of "overtly advocating peace, covertly assisting the thugs." The White Paper states: "On the one hand, we should assist the Kuomintang to establish its sovereignty as widely as possible in China, and on the other hand, encourage negotiations." From the time Marshall came to China in 1945 to engage in the old Political Consultative Conference, until Stuart incited Li Zongren to engage in the fake peace movement in early 1949, the U.S. imperialist policy in China was such a conspiracy of "overtly advocating peace, covertly assisting the thugs." The White Paper also said that Marshall's use of this two-pronged policy was very successful at a certain stage. Because when Marshall left China in 1947, "thanks to our transportation, armaments, and supply assistance, the Kuomintang clearly reached its peak in military achievements and territorial expansion." Relying on this "peak" military advantage, the Jiang bandits launched an all-out civil war in 1947. Unexpectedly, the Jiang bandits could not support it for half a year and asked the U.S. imperialists for help again. So after Wedemeyer came to China to investigate, he suggested "co-management of the Northeast" and "the government's troops and military continue to use American advisors." Obviously, this is a suggestion to destroy China. From the White Paper, we also see detailed accounts of the U.S. imperialists supplying the Jiang bandits with money and materials. The money sent by the U.S. imperialists to the Jiang bandits accounted for "50 percent" of the Jiang government's expenses. In addition, there were airplanes, warships, tanks, artillery, guns, and bombs. The money and materials sent by the U.S. imperialists to the Jiang bandits to carry out the civil war far exceeded the assistance we received during the War of Resistance against Japan. The U.S. imperialists also had a huge military advisory group in Nanjing: formulating combat plans for the Jiang bandits, collecting military intelligence, and even commanding combat in the field. In any case, the U.S. imperialists have actually participated in China's civil war. Can the U.S. imperialists still deny that they are the enemy of the Chinese people? Can they still deny that U.S. imperialist aggression against China in the past five years has not intensified?

　　Here, we must also cite some facts concealed in the White Paper to prove that the U.S. imperialists' so-called encouragement of consultation is completely a trick. During the Old Political Consultative Conference, Marshall and Chiang Kai-shek insisted that the Northeast issue and the military issue were not within the scope of the Political Consultative Conference discussion. The reorganized Chinese army was equipped and trained by the U.S. imperialists. Obviously, this is a conspiracy between Jiang and the U.S. to use the Northeast base and the Chinese army to realize the anti-Soviet and anti-communist policy. In 1945, Truman issued a statement hoping that China would organize a coalition government including the Communist Party. Afterwards, in fact, Marshall and Stuart supported the Jiang bandits' policy of firmly rejecting the Communist Party's participation in the government. In 1946, the Jiang bandits unilaterally convened a fake National Congress and formulated a fake constitution. Not only did Marshall and Stuart support the Jiang bandits in tearing up the resolutions of the Old Political Consultative Conference, but they also tried their best to win over the reactionary Democratic Youth Party to participate in the fake National Congress and organize a fake coalition government. Later, when the Nanjing puppet constitutional government farce began in 1948, Truman supported it and publicly denied the previous statement that he supported the coalition government and opposed the Communist Party's participation in the coalition government of any country in the world. This fully proves that Marshall and Stuart's "mediation work" in China was completely a trick. The White Paper obliterates these important events, not mentioning a word, which is of course intentional concealment and deception. We, the China Democratic League, were personally involved in the national affairs of those years. We probably see the behind-the-scenes collusion between the U.S. and Jiang more clearly than others. Today, we are willing to expose these conspiracies to confirm that in the past five years, U.S. imperialist aggression against China has indeed intensified.

　　Today, the U.S. imperialists are still deliberately planning further aggression against China. The U.S. imperialists' publication of the White Paper is also proof of this conspiracy. The White Paper cleanly shifts the blame for the failure of the aggressive policy to the Jiang bandits. It says that this is the result of the servants not listening to the master's orders, and that this is "beyond the control of the U.S. government." It refuses to admit that the reason for the failure is the error of the reactionary policy and the irresistibility of the Chinese people's power. It can be seen that the U.S. imperialism is unrepentant to the death. What methods will it use to step up its aggression in the future? In our opinion, there are only three strategies: (1) using Chinese to fight Chinese; (2) colluding to rob; (3) directly acting recklessly.

　　Acheson's so-called encouragement of "democratic individualism" to overthrow the "foreign system" is a conspiracy to find other servants and use Chinese to fight Chinese. The so-called "democratic individualism" is still an import of capitalist old democracy in China, as the Xinhua News Agency editorial on August 15 said: "There is still a thin social foundation in China." In fact, Marshall and Stuart have already put a lot of effort into these democratic people who constitute this "thin social foundation" and have used tricks of deception. A few who are willing to be deceived have reached the end of their road. Some of them have already fled overseas to become "white Chinese," and some have followed Chiang Kai-shek to become loyal ministers to be buried with him. Even if the U.S. imperialists still have the illusion of using these so-called "democratic individualists," they have long been disdained by the Chinese people and cannot have any effect or effectiveness. The Buddha taken out of the cesspool can no longer attract incense. In fact, we also have to thank Chiang Kai-shek, the servant of the U.S. imperialists, for his old democratic tricks of hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat directed for the U.S. imperialists, and his brutal means of oppression, which forced many intellectuals of the Chinese middle class to Liangshanpo to make revolution. We also cannot but thank the U.S. imperialists for this White Paper, which allowed Chinese intellectuals to completely see through the Western tricks sung and sold by Marshall, Hurley, Wedemeyer, and Stuart in China. Even those liberalists who still have some illusions about the U.S. imperialists will surely be awakened by this White Paper. True "democratic individualists" will be able to love themselves and their country, and will never sell out their motherland and become servants of the U.S. imperialists. We believe that Chinese "democratic individualists" will be able to stand under the banner of new democracy and fight to completely overthrow imperialist aggression.

　　The Achesons need not use tricks of sowing discord among the Chinese people again. What "regime serving foreign interests" and what "regime listening to foreign orders and serving foreign interests" are all big lies deliberately slandered by the Washington government. If these absurd and insulting words refer to the "leaning to one side" in China's current diplomatic policy, we are willing to frankly answer this question. In the struggle between democracy and anti-democracy, progress and reaction in the world, there is no room for neutrality. The way to establish a country is to clearly distinguish between friends and enemies. Mr. Sun Yat-sen once called on the Chinese people to "ally with Russia, ally with the Communist Party," and "unite with the nations of the world that treat me equally to fight together." Mr. Mao Zedong said very truly: "The whole world is the same. If you don't lean to imperialism, you lean to socialism." The Chinese people can see clearly that the Soviet Union is a friendly country that treats me equally, and the United States is an enemy that invades China. We can only make friends with all countries that treat me equally, and we must never surrender to the imperialists who invade us.

　　If recognizing that new democracy has foreign ideological components is to slander this as a foreign system, then the outdated old democracy is an import from imperialism to China. Ideas have no geographical boundaries. As long as it is a progressive idea, as long as it is a system that is beneficial to the people, the Chinese people are of course willing to accept it. The American people should remember that the revolutionary ideas of Washington, the American old democracy, were all imported from the English and French countries on the European continent. This kind of ideological input is the progress of your ancestors, not a shame in your history.

　　Secondly, the current U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to form a Pacific alliance and collude with Japanese fascists is a way of colluding to rob. It should be noted that the people of the world have progressed today. Progressive people love peace and oppose war. The progressive people of these countries will jointly rise up to oppose this imperialist aggression. This action of the U.S. imperialists challenging the people of the world will surely dig their own graves and ring their own death knells.

　　Furthermore, the U.S. imperialists will of course adopt direct reckless methods such as "economic blockade." We want to frankly warn the U.S. imperialists: Today, the Chinese people have strong unity. We have the determination and courage to fight imperialism to the end. There are ways to overcome economic difficulties.

　　Finally, we want to point out that the progressive forces of the American people are also expanding and growing. The progressive American people will jointly rise up to oppose this reactionary and adventurous aggressive policy of the Truman government. We are willing to build the true friendship between the Chinese and American nations on the people. The people of China and the United States should unite to combat and smash the aggressive conspiracies of Truman and Acheson to strive for the progress and peace of the people of the world!

### 中国民主同盟总部　对美帝白皮书的斥责

　　中国民主同盟总部
  　对美帝白皮书的斥责
    【平市讯】中国民主同盟总部昨（二十三）日发表“对美帝白皮书的斥责”，全文如下：
    我们读了美国杜鲁门反动政府在八月五日发表的“美国对华关系”这本白皮书后，只得到了这样一个结论：美国过去一百年来继续不断地侵略中国；最近五年来更变本加厉地侵略中国；今天又正在处心积虑地计划着进一步侵略中国。杜鲁门政府发表这本白皮书的初衷当然想掩饰这个事实，却得到了欲盖弥彰的结果，把上面这个事实反映得更为清楚。现在我们就依据白皮书里的材料与艾奇逊关于白皮书所发表的函件及谈话来证明我们这个结论，来揭穿美帝这个阴险毒辣的阴谋。
    白皮书第一章“美国百年来的政策”中，总编辑耶塞普煞费苦心，把百年来中美关系描写得那般光荣美满，仿佛中国在五十年前倘没有遇着美国这个“道义”朋友，必早已被瓜分了。白皮书苦口婆心说明“门户开放”，“利益均沾”，“最惠国”条款等等，是美国“反对外国对中国内政有任何干涉”。其实此话不说也罢，说出来侵略者更加显出原形来了。当十九世纪末年，美国是帝国主义后起之秀。那时它眼看其他帝国主义者在中国已捷足先登，各自划定了势力范围，它于是急起直追，向列强提出了在中国的“利益均沾”的分脏办法来。这就是美帝对华“门户开放”政策的来源。所谓“最惠国”条款这正是“利益均沾”的实施。这正是百年来中国一切不平等条约上的最耻辱的条文。美帝有一位聪明的门罗总统，他为美国宣布了“门罗主义”，紧紧地关闭了自己的大门。美国更出了一位聪明的海约翰国务卿，他为中国规定了“门户开放”主义，强迫中国永远开着大门。美国自己关起大门来，却强迫中国永远“开门揖盗”。美国说这是它“维护中国主权完整及政治独立”的大原则。依据这个“维护”的政策，美帝在华的特权，例如租界，治外法权，内河航行等等，都要有尽有了。自第一次世界大战后，美国在帝国主义侵略者强盗丛中，竟是后来居上。美帝于是想在中国从“均沾”走到了“独占”，从“独占”更要把中国做成它的独占的半殖民地或全殖民地。这就是美帝口中百年来中美关系上“光荣美满”的历史。这真是好一段“光荣”美满的历史哟！
    过去百年来美帝侵华的事实是如彼。最近五年来（一九四四——一九四九）美帝对华的侵略，更是变本加厉。话从一九四五年日寇投降后，中国抗战得到了胜利的结束说起。第二次世界大战结果，德意日三个帝国主义者惨败，这就加强了美帝称雄世界的野心。罗斯福逝世，杜鲁门上台，这位被美国资本阶级捧出来的右派总统，为保障美国的资本阶级利益起见，于是确定了反苏反共的国策。为着要实现这个国策，于是杜鲁门一手握着黄金，一手拿着原子弹，脾睨一世，立意要控制大西洋与太平洋。为着实现这个反苏反共政策，在太平洋方面就要控制我们中国。从美帝眼光中，中国应当成为它的独占殖民地。无论如何，美国要把握住中国的人民与土地，作为反苏反共的工具，绝不能让中国复兴，更不能让中国人民的进步力量抬头。明了了美帝这个阴谋，就很容易明了五年来美帝在华一切反人民反进步的捣乱行为。美帝在白皮书中不打自招供认出来的全盘材料都证明上面这个前提。
    过去五年之中，赫尔利、马歇尔、魏德迈等人先后来华，司徒雷登做大使，他们只有一个共同的而且唯一的使命，那就是紧紧地控制中国，把握住这个独占的半殖民地，使它成为实现美帝反苏反共国策的基地。白皮书里丰富的材料，把这点说得明明白白。美帝今天固毋庸狡赖；我们更不必再有丝毫怀疑。赫尔利来华，简单明了，因为美帝“关切国民党每况愈下的形势”将来在政治上与军事上不能与共产党斗争。最值得注意的是白皮书上说到和平来临时美帝对华政策有三条路抉择。第二条路是“大规模的在军事方面加以干涉。援助国民党，以击毁共产党”。这里，美帝的原形毕露了。白皮书第一章里极力宣扬的“反对外国对中国干涉”这句欺骗话，如今自己公开说出“干涉”两个字来了。美帝为什么不敢明目张胆走这条参加中国内战之路呢？因为蒋政府“可悲的表现出来，也许只靠美国的力量才能逐走共产党。”杜鲁门政府如此做法，并没考虑到可以引起中国人民的反对，他怕“美国人民显然不会答应”。实际第三条路比第二条路更阴险毒辣。第三条路是“明里劝和，暗里帮凶”的做法。白皮书上说：“一方面援助国民党，尽可能广大的在中国确立其主权，一方面鼓励从事协商。”从一九四五年马歇尔来华搞旧政协起，直到一九四九年初司徒雷登鼓动李宗仁搞假和平运动为止，美帝在华的政策就是这样一个“明劝和，暗帮凶”的阴谋。白皮书还说到马歇尔运用这两面政策在某个阶段甚有成绩。因为在一九四七年马歇尔离华时，“由于我们的运输，武装，和补给的帮助，国民党在军事的成就上和领域的扩张上显然登峰造极”。蒋匪就凭着这“登峰造极”的军事优势，在一九四七年发动了全面内战。不意蒋匪支持不到半年，又向美帝求救。于是魏德迈来华调查之后，建议“东北共管”“政府的军队与军事延用美国顾问”。很明显的这是灭亡中国的一种建议，从白皮书上我们又看到美帝供给蒋匪金钱与物资的详细帐目。美帝送给蒋匪的金钱占了蒋政府“百分之五十”的开支。此外还有飞机，军舰，坦克，大炮，枪支，炸弹。美帝送给蒋匪进行内战的金钱与物资，远超过抗战时期给我们的援助。美帝还有一个庞大的军事顾问团在南京：为蒋匪订定作战计划，搜集军事情报，甚至实地指挥作战。从任何方面来说，美帝已实际参加中国的内战了。美帝还能抵赖它不是中国人民的敌人吗？还能抵赖近五年来美帝对华侵略不是变本加厉吗？
    到这里，我们还要举出一些白皮书上隐瞒了的事实来证明美帝所谓的鼓励协商，完全是个骗局。旧政协时候，马歇尔与蒋介石坚持东北问题军事问题不在政协讨论范围。改编后的中国军队，由美帝装备训练。很明显，这是蒋美勾结用东北基地，用中国军队，以实现反苏反共政策的阴谋。一九四五年杜鲁门发表声明，希望中国组织包括共产党参加的联合政府。其后事实上马歇尔与司徒雷登支持蒋匪坚决拒绝共产党参加政府的政策。一九四六年蒋匪片面召集伪国大，制定伪宪法，马司二人不只支持蒋匪撕毁旧政协决议，并竭力拉拢反动的民青二党参加伪国大，组织伪联合政府。其后一九四八年南京伪宪政傀儡戏开演的时候，杜鲁门为之捧场，竟公开谈话否认前此赞成联合政府的声明，并反对共产党参加世界任何国家的联合政府。这充分证明马歇尔司徒雷登在华“调解工作”，完全是个骗局。白皮书对这些重要事件，一笔抹煞，一字不提，这当然是有意的隐瞒欺骗。那几年的国事经过，我们民盟曾身与其事。美蒋勾结的黑幕，我们看得可能比旁人更清楚。我们今天愿揭露这些阴谋，以证实最近五年来，美帝侵华实是变本加厉了。
    今天美帝依然处心积虑计划着进一步的对华侵略。美帝发表白皮书又是这种阴谋的证明。白皮书把侵略政策的失败，干干净净推卸在蒋匪身上。说这是奴才不听主子命令的结果，说这是“美国政府控制所不及”。他不肯承认失败的原因，是由于反动政策的错误，是由于中国人民力量的不可抵抗。可见美帝国主义是至死不悟的。它今后将用什么方法来加紧侵略呢？我们看来不外三策：（一）以华乱华；（二）结伙抢劫；（三）直接蛮干。
    艾奇逊函中所谓鼓励“民主个人主义”者来推翻“外来制度”，这就是另找奴才，以华乱华的阴谋。所谓的“民主个人主义”这在中国依然是资本主义的旧民主主义的输入品，诚如八月十五日新华社社论所言：“在中国还有一层薄薄的社会基础。”其实马歇尔与司徒雷登对构成这“薄薄的社会基础”的民主人士早已下过一番工夫，施展过愚弄的伎俩。少数甘受愚弄者已经弄到走头无路的尽头。他们有些已经逃亡海外做“白华”去了，有些已经追随蒋介石去做殉葬的忠臣去了。美帝即令仍有利用这些所谓“民主个人主义”者的幻想，他们早已为中国人民所不齿，不能发生丝毫作用与效用。从粪坑里再拿出来的菩萨，吸引不到香火了。实际我们亦不能不感谢美帝奴才蒋介石，他那为美帝导演的挂羊头卖狗肉的旧民主的把戏，他那套残酷压迫的手段，把中国中间阶层许多知识分子都逼上了革命的梁山泊，我们亦不能不感谢美帝这本白皮书，使中国的知识分子把马歇尔、赫尔利、魏德迈、司徒雷登们在中国唱卖的西洋镜完全看穿。即令还有对美帝尚存些微幻想的自由主义分子，亦必为这本白皮书所唤醒。真正的“民主个人主义”者必能自爱爱国，绝不至出卖祖国，甘为美帝做奴才。我们相信，中国的“民主个人主义”者必能站在新民主主义旗帜下，来为彻底打倒帝国主义的侵略而斗争。
    艾奇逊们亦大可不必再来向中国人民使用挑拨离间的伎俩。什么“替外国利益服务”的政权，什么“听命于外国，替外国效劳的政权”，这些都是华盛顿政府存心诬蔑的大谎。倘这些荒唐侮辱的言词，是指中国今天外交政策上“一边倒”这句话说的，我们愿坦白答复这个问题。在世界上民主与反民主，进步与反动的斗争中，是没有中立的余地的。立国之道，友敌必分别清楚。孙中山先生曾经用“联俄联共”，“联合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奋斗”号召国人。毛泽东先生说得十分真确：“全世界一样，不倒向帝国主义，就倒向社会主义”。中国人民看得清楚，苏联是一个以平等待我的友帮，美国是个侵略中国的敌人。我们只能与平等待我的一切国家做朋友，绝不能向侵略我们的帝国主义者投降。
    倘认新民主主义有外来的思想成份，即诋此为外来制度，那末落伍的旧民主主义更是帝国主义向中国的输入品。思想是没有疆域界限的。只要是进步的思想，只要是有利于人民的制度，中国人民当然愿意接受。美国人民应该记得，当年美国华盛顿革命的思想，美国旧民主主义这整套东西，难道不是从欧洲大陆上英法各国输入美国的吗？这种思想输入，是你们祖宗们的进步，并不是你们历史上的耻辱。
    其次，目前美帝所搞的太平洋同盟及勾结日本法西斯等等阴谋，这是结伴抢劫的办法。须知今天世界人民已经进步了。进步的人民是爱好和平，反对战争的。这些国家进步的人民，必共起反对这种帝国主义的侵略。美帝这种向世界人民挑战的行动，必是自掘坟墓，自撞丧钟。
    再其次，美帝当然要采用“经济封锁”等等直接蛮干的办法。我们要坦白警告美帝：今天中国人民有了坚强的团结。我们有了与帝国主义斗争到底的决心与勇气。是有办法来渡过经济难关的。
    最后，我们要指出，今天美国人民的进步力量，亦正在扩大增涨中。美国进步的人民对杜鲁门政府这种反动的而且冒险的侵略政策，必共起反对。我们愿把中美两个民族的真正友谊建立在人民身上。中美两国人民应联合起来打击并粉碎杜鲁门艾奇逊们的侵略阴谋，以争取世界人民的进步与和平！
