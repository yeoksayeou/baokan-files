    Save the Crops About to Be Harvested
    Eradicate Armyworms on Both Sides of the Ping-Han Railway
    Interview with the Person in Charge of the Agricultural Department of the North China Government

    [Our Newspaper] Since mid-July, crops on both sides of the Ping-Han Railway in North China have been successively infested with armyworms (also known as marching worms, ＠＠). Most villages in the six districts of Shijiazhuang City discovered armyworms around July 12th, covering an area of about ten hectares. After active treatment by farmers, they were basically eliminated by July 14th. Qingyuan, Mancheng, Shenze, Jin County, Shulu, Ningjin and other counties in the former Jizhong area, from July 27th and 28th to early August, experienced a second outbreak of armyworms. Near Baoding alone, there were more than 40 villages. They are currently laying eggs, and a small portion have already hatched into small armyworms. The cause of this armyworm outbreak is the hot and humid weather after the rain, which is suitable for armyworms to lay eggs and live. The less ventilated the area, the more eggs are laid. The most serious is the millet fields, with an average of one egg mass for every ten millet plants. Each mass has at least five or sixty eggs, and the most can have two hundred fifty or sixty eggs. Most of the eggs are laid in millet fields, followed by sorghum, corn fields, and the sides of roads. Armyworm eggs have also been found on foxtail grass.
    In the past, armyworms occurred every year on both sides of the Ping-Han Railway, causing great damage to seedlings. In order to protect the upcoming autumn harvest and provide experience in eliminating armyworms in various places for timely eradication, this reporter visited the responsible comrade of the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government the other day, who discussed the methods for eradicating armyworms as follows:
    The Most Effective Way to Eradicate Armyworms is to Collect Eggs
    The first method to eradicate armyworms is to collect eggs. According to recent experience, as long as specific examples are given to teach the masses how to identify insect eggs, women and children can do this work. In the past, the masses were very afraid of armyworms, but when they see that this method can eliminate armyworms and protect the crops that are about to be harvested, their enthusiasm will be very high. For example, in villages around Fuchangtun in Qingyuan County, the masses can collect one or two bags of leaves with eggs laid on them every day, which is very effective in eradicating the reproduction of armyworms. Therefore, areas where armyworms have occurred in the past should be particularly vigilant, quickly absorb this experience, and the leadership should immediately seize the opportunity, promptly dispatch technical personnel to go down, and cooperate with the masses to conduct inspections in the fields. If armyworm moths are found, there will be armyworm eggs on the millet leaves. Moths mate mostly in the evening. They are earth-yellow, slightly white, and the egg-laying period is about seven days. Because the moths emerge at different times, it is estimated that the egg-laying period will be over after August 20th. The eggs are oval, smaller than rice grains, white and bright, and laid on the tip of the leaves, arranged in rows. After laying eggs, the tip of the leaf curls up and quickly turns yellowish-white, which the common people call "dry tip," which is easy to identify. The eggs turn into small armyworms after about seven days. Therefore, the egg-collecting method should be carried out intensively during the egg-laying period in order to be effective. When collecting eggs, it is best to carry small cloth pockets, collect and put them in as you go, and then take the collected leaves out and burn them. This is a very meticulous organizational work, which should be led by local cadres in an organized manner, rather than just calling on women and children to do it. When collecting eggs, pay attention not to damage the crops, do not collect leaves that are too long (only collect the section where the eggs are laid), and continue to check after collecting. If egg collection is not thorough and armyworms are found, the masses should be immediately organized to catch and kill them on the spot. In addition to mobilizing the masses to collect eggs, armyworm carts should also be prepared in case of emergency (armyworm carts can be found in the "Agricultural Production" section of the July 30th People's Daily, issue 9).
    The second is chemical control. This is still in the trial stage this year. Agricultural technicians should be fully prepared. After armyworms occur, they must use the issued agricultural medicines. At the same time, the initially collected egg masses should be quickly raised into larvae for drug efficacy tests, so as to master the technology and give full play to the effectiveness of the drugs, and the use effect and economic value must be summarized. As for DDT powder and lead arsenate, they can be sprayed directly with a powder sprayer (refer to the same issue of "Agricultural Production"). The spraying period should be in the morning and evening, taking advantage of the dew and humidity, using one to two kilograms per mu, depending on the height of the millet seedlings. Each person can spray one or twenty mu per day. If using Dilith powder, one kilogram of drug powder can be mixed with three kilograms of grass ash (fine ash surface). (Lin Hong)

### 保住吃到嘴边的庄稼  扑灭平汉两侧粘虫  华北政府农业部负责人谈话

    保住吃到嘴边的庄稼
    扑灭平汉两侧粘虫
    华北政府农业部负责人谈话
    【本报讯】华北地区平汉路两侧的农作物，自七月中旬后陆续发生粘虫（又名行军虫、＠＠）。石家庄市六区大部村庄在七月十二日发现粘虫，面积达十顷左右，经农民积极救治，到七月十四日以后，基本上已被消灭；原冀中区的清苑、满城、深泽、晋县、束鹿、宁晋等县，七月二十七、八日至八月初，又发生第二期粘虫，仅保定附近，即有四十余村，现正在产卵，并有一小部分已化为小粘虫。此次粘虫发生的原因，是雨后闷热，适于粘虫产卵与生活，越是不透风的地方，产卵越多，较严重的是谷地，平均每十棵谷即有一卵块，每块至少也有五、六十粒以上，最多者有二百五、六十粒左右。产卵多系在谷地，黍稷、高粱、玉米地次之，路旁、地边的谷莠杂草上也有粘虫卵发现。
    过去，平汉路两侧历年均有粘虫发生，对于禾苗危害甚大。为了保护即将到来的秋收，提供各地灭治粘虫经验，以便及时扑灭，记者特于日前往访华北人民政府农业部负责同志，承谈扑灭粘虫办法如下：
    扑灭粘虫办法采卵最有效力
    扑灭粘虫首先应用采卵的办法。根据最近的经验，只要拿出具体实例，教给群众识别虫卵的办法，妇女儿童都可以从事这一工作。群众过去对粘虫甚为害怕，但当他看到这个方法可以消灭粘虫保住即将到嘴边的庄稼，情绪便会非常高涨。如清苑县富长屯一带村庄，群众每日能采一两口袋产卵的叶子，对于扑灭粘虫的繁殖甚有功效。因此，过去曾发生粘虫的地方，应特别警惕，迅速吸取这一经验，领导上应马上抓紧，及时派遣技术人员下去，协同群众到地里进行检查。如发现粘虫蛾子时，谷叶上就会有粘虫卵。蛾子交配，多系在傍晚，系土黄色、稍白、产卵时期约在七日左右，因蛾子出土，时间不同，估计在八月二十日后，产卵期即可过去。卵粒为椭圆形，比米粒还小，白色发明，产在叶尖，排成一道一道的。产卵后，叶子的尖端即卷成卷，很快便变成黄白色，老百姓叫乾尖，识别甚易，卵约经七天后，即变成小粘虫。因此采卵办法应在产卵期间抓紧进行，才易收效。采卵时，最好携带小布口袋，随采随装，事后将采回的叶子拿出烧掉。这是一件很细致的组织工作，应由各地干部领导，有组织的进行，而不应光叫妇女儿童去作。采卵时并应注意不要踏坏庄稼，不要采的叶子过长（仅采产卵的一节），采完后还要继续检查。如采卵不彻底发现粘虫时，应立即组织群众，就地捕灭。此外在发动群众采卵的同时，应准备粘虫车子，以防万一（粘虫车子可参考七月三十日人民日报“农业生产”第九期）。
    其次便是药剂防除。这在今年还属试用性质，农业技术人员应充分准备，在粘虫发生后，务将所发下的农业药品，使用出去；同时应将最初采下的卵块，迅速地养成幼虫，进行药效试验，以便掌握技术，充分发挥药的效能，并一定将使用效果经济价值，作出总结。至于ＤＤＴ粉与砒酸铅可用喷粉器直接喷撒（参考同期“农业生产”）。喷粉时期，应在早晨与晚上，趁着有露水潮湿时进行，每亩用一斤至二斤，视谷苗高低而定。每人每日可喷一、二十亩。如用地力斯粉，可用药粉一斤，与草木灰（细灰面）三斤混合使用。（林洪）
