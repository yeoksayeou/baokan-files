    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th: TASS, Washington dispatch: On August 8th, the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Armed Services Committee held a joint meeting to begin hearing testimony from various parties regarding the amended government bill on arming countries of the Atlantic Military Alliance and other nations. The first to testify was US Secretary of State Acheson. Acheson attempted to portray Western countries as facing a so-called threat of "aggression," describing the US armament plan as "defensive" and consistent with the United Nations. Acheson stubbornly insisted that the threat of "aggression" came from various "Communist governments." Acheson seemed to want to use this simple method to divert world public opinion from the American aggression plot, which is being prepared under the Atlantic Pact. Acheson claimed that America's first "line of defense" remains in Europe.
    Acheson claimed that the military expenditure of Western European countries is currently 5.5 billion US dollars annually. This indicates how enormous the current military expenditure already is, and what the true cost of the American politicians’ propaganda about Western European economic "revival" really is. On top of this expense, there is also a new military expense borne by Western countries under the obligations of the Atlantic Pact.

    艾奇逊的狡辩
    竟说第一道“防”线在欧洲
    妄图闪避世界舆论的斥责
    【新华社北平十一日电】塔斯社华盛顿讯：八月八日，美参院外交委员会与武装部队委员会举行联席会议，开始听取各方对经过修改的政府关于武装大西洋军事同盟各国及其它国家的法案。第一个出席作证的是美国务卿艾奇逊。艾奇逊企图把西方国家描绘作所谓面临着“侵略”的威胁，形容美国武装计划是“防御性”的，是和联合国一致的。艾奇逊硬说“侵略”的威胁是来自各“共产党政府”。艾奇逊似乎想用这种简单的手法转移世界舆论对于美国侵略图谋的注意，这一图谋正在大西洋公约之下予以准备中。艾奇逊声称，美国的第一道“防”线仍然是在欧洲。
    艾奇逊声称，目前，西欧各国的军费每年为五十五亿美元。这指明了目前的军费已经是如何地浩大，以及美国政客们关于西欧经济“复兴”的宣传，其真实的代价究竟是什么。在这笔费用上还得加上西方国家按大西洋公约的义务所担负的一笔新的军费。
