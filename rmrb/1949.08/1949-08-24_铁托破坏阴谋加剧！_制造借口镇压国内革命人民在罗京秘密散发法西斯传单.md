Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd: The Tito traitorous clique's activities of sabotaging Eastern European people's regimes and suppressing progressive people at home are intensifying. TASS Bucharest, August 20th dispatch, citing the Romanian newspaper "Spark," reported that on the evening of July 16th, citizens on Viitorului Street in Bucharest captured two employees of the Yugoslav Embassy, Ratsic and Midic, who were distributing fascist leaflets against the Romanian People's Democratic regime in the gardens of the area. The materials obtained and their confessions confirmed that the Tito bourgeois nationalist clique is systematically conducting secret activities in the People's Democratic countries under the cover of diplomacy. These secretly distributed leaflets were proven to have been printed in Belgrade. The Tito clique used diplomatic channels to carry these leaflets across the border. The newspaper also stated that Ratsic even pulled out his illegally carried pistol and attempted to shoot the people arresting him when he was captured.

Within Yugoslavia, the Tito clique recently imitated Hitler's Reichstag fire incident, attempting to use the fire on the 3,000-ton merchant ship "Batizaak" in the port of Split as an excuse to further bloodily suppress the Yugoslav revolutionary people. According to TASS, citing the Italian Communist Party's newspaper "Unità," the fire on the "Batizaak" was likely part of a large-scale provocation to create an excuse to intensify the retaliation against Cominform elements in Yugoslavia, while Yugoslav prisons and concentration camps are already filled with communists, democrats, and internationalists. The fire on the "Batizaak" will inevitably play the same role for the Nazis as the Reichstag fire, which is to create "public opinion" against the Yugoslav Communists.

　　铁托破坏阴谋加剧！
    制造借口镇压国内革命人民在罗京秘密散发法西斯传单
    【新华社北平二十三日电】铁托叛徒集团破坏东欧人民政权和镇压国内进步人民的活动，正变本加厉。塔斯社布加勒斯特二十日电引罗京火花报报道，七月十六日晚，罗京维伊托鲁卢街的市民，捕捉了南斯拉夫大使馆职员拉特西区和米迪区两人，他们系在该区的花园中散发反对罗马尼亚人民民主政权的法西斯传单。所获材料以及他们的供辞确证了铁托资产阶级民族主义集团正在外交的掩护下，在人民民主国家内有系统地进行秘密活动。这种秘密散发的传单，被证实是在贝尔格莱德印行的。铁托集团利用外交途径携带这些传单越过边境。该报又称：拉特西区在被捕时竟拔出他所非法携带的手枪企图枪击逮捕他的人。
    在南斯拉夫国内，铁托集团最近仿效希特勒国会纵火案的故技，企图借三千吨商船“巴蒂扎克号”在斯普里特港起火的事件，作为进一步血腥镇压南斯拉夫革命人民的借口。据塔斯社引意共团结报评称：“巴蒂扎克”轮船的起火，很可能是大规模挑衅行动的一部分，用以制造借口，加紧对南斯拉夫共产党情报局分子行使报复，而南斯拉夫的监狱和集中营中业经装满了共产党员、民主分子和国际主义者。“巴蒂扎克”的起火必将起着象国会纵火对纳粹所起的同样作用，这就是制造“舆论”以反对南斯拉夫共产党人。
