To the Editor:

Following the publication of Comrade Han Zhenxing of the North Factory Study Group's opinion regarding "marching in formation on tram tracks" in the Readers' Suggestions column of the People's Daily on August 20th, we immediately conducted an investigation, pursued responsibility, and engaged in profound self-criticism. The incident unfolded as follows: At 5:00 PM on August 3rd, troops from our Third Regiment were assembling at the headquarters' location. Primarily due to a lack of urban knowledge and insufficient education for the personnel at the time of the march, negligence occurred. While marching on the street, the troops proceeded four abreast. Furthermore, due to the large number of pedicabs and bicycles on the side of the road at the time, the troops failed to promptly move to the side, and consequently walked onto the tram tracks. Although no one from the tram came down to negotiate, the comrades at the rear of the队伍 heard the tram bell but did not report it to the leading comrades, resulting in a delay of the tram's journey and causing such a negative phenomenon. In addition to sincerely accepting Comrade Han's criticism and apologizing to the tram personnel and passengers, we have instructed the regiment to strengthen education on maintaining traffic order, strictly pursue responsibility, and conduct self-criticism to prevent this phenomenon from recurring. This is our reply. With a military salute,

　　　Political Department of the Public Security Headquarters

　　公安总队作自我检讨
  　答复本报读者批评
    决加强所属交通秩序教育编辑同志：
    人民日报八月廿日读者建议栏内发表北厂学习小组韩振兴对于我队所提出的“电车道上结队行进”的意见后，我们即刻进行了调查和追究责任，并深刻的做了检讨。事情的发生是这样的，八月三日下午五时我三团部队正向总队驻地集合，首先由于对城市知识缺乏，对当时行进的人员教育不足，致发生疏忽，在街道上行进时，四路并进，并且因为当时马路边三轮车、自行车很多，部队未能及时靠边，遂走上电车道上去，虽然电车上并未下来人交涉，但是在队伍最后边的同志听到电车响铃也未向前边领队同志报告，致未能及时调动队伍，而耽误电车行进时间，产生如此不好的现象。我们除诚恳接受韩同志的批评，向电车上的服务人员和乘客致歉外，并令该团加强维护交通秩序教育，严加追究责任，进行检讨，以免今后再重复这一现象。此复。军礼
