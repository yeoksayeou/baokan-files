    On "Test-Taking"
    Jing Qiu
    Recently, I saw books like "Political Economy Q&A," "New Democracy Q&A," etc., on the streets. These thin booklets take the form of questions and answers. Their content includes economics, politics, philosophy... pieced together from here and there, quoting out of context, and appearing to be right but actually wrong.
    Therefore, besides hoping that the government can strictly examine these books that harm the people, I would also like to discuss another issue here.
    It is said that these books sell quite well, and their target audience is mostly young students. Their purpose in buying them is mostly to apply for schools. To cope with exams, hoping to obtain some revolutionary theories from these pamphlets, this kind of learning viewpoint and attitude is really something that cannot but draw our attention.
    During the Kuomintang's rule, all economic, political, and cultural affairs were controlled and monopolized by the reactionaries, and education was also used as a tool to harm the people. In schools, in addition to instilling feudal and enslaving ideas into students, they also taught things that were not useful, and knowledge was divorced from life. The schools also used unreasonable examination systems to restrict students' activities and thoughts. Under this kind of situation, students could not develop an interest in learning, and some students saw schools as a stepping stone to advancement, forming the concept of muddling through and deceiving with diplomas. This was naturally unavoidable.
    After liberation, the situation has been completely different from the past. The government belongs to the people, and the task of education is to cultivate various construction cadres for the new China in large numbers. We study revolutionary theory in order to draw on the revolutionary experience accumulated by our predecessors to strengthen our work ability. Therefore, everyone should attach importance to studying revolutionary theory, carefully study it, understand its spirit, and learn the revolutionary stand, viewpoint, and method. The political examination in schools is only to test the students' level of political understanding and understand their ideological situation. If students want to obtain fragmentary phrases from these pamphlets in order to cope with exams, it is not only useless, but also definitely not the attitude we should have.

### 谈“应考”

    谈“应考”
    静秋
    最近，在街上看到一些“政治经济学问答”“新民主主义问答”……之类的书籍。薄薄的一本册子，采取问答的形式。其内容包括经济、政治、哲学……，东抄西窃，断章取义，似是而非。
    因此，我除了希望政府能对此类危害人民的书籍，加以严格审查外，这里，还使我谈及另一个问题。
    据说，这些书籍的销路还很不错，其对象多为青年学生。他们购买的目的则多是为了投考学校。为应付考试，希冀从这些小册子里获得一些革命理论，这一种学习的观点与态度，实是不得不教人为之注意的。
    在国民党统治时期，一切经济、政治、文化都为反动派所统制垄断，教育亦被利用为危害人民的工具。在学校里，他们除了给学生灌输封建的、奴化的思想外；同时，学非所用，知识是与生活脱节的。学校并利用不合理的考试制度，束缚学生的活动与思想。在这一种情况下，学生们对于学习无法发生兴趣，并使部分学生视学校为进身的阶梯，形成了混资格、骗文凭的观念。这实是自然不过的一回事。
    解放后，情形已全然非昔了。政府是人民自己的，教育的任务，是为了大量培养新中国的各种建设干部。我们学习革命理论，便是为了汲取前人所累积的革命经验，以加强我们的工作能力。因此，每个人应该重视与学习革命的理论，精心研究，体会其精神，学习革命的立场、观点与方法。而学校的政治考试，则不过是为了测验学生对政治认识的程度，了解学生的思想状况。如果学生们为了应考而想从这些小册子中得到片断的词句，实是毫无益处，且决非我们所应有的态度。
