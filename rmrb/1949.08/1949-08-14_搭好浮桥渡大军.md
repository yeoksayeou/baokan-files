    Build a Pontoon Bridge to Ferry the Army Across
     As narrated by sailor Wang Anyu
     Notes by Jun Qian
     The Northeast Army is truly brave,
     Liberating the Northeast and entering the Pass;
     Tianjin and Beiping are completely liberated,
     General Lin leads the army across Henan.
     The Yellow River Commander issued a notice:
     Prepare the boats in each detachment.
     The Second Detachment, they sailed the boats from Puyang;
     The Seventh Detachment, they also sailed the boats from Qihe.
     With a north wind, the boats run fast,
     Without a north wind, they pull the cables,
     Day and night pulling the boats,
     Moving forward to Shouzhang County.
     They received the task at Sunjiakou,
     And moored the boats at Sunjiakou.
     The Second Detachment, the Fourth Detachment, the Seventh Detachment,
     The three detachments, who knows how many boats there are?
     One mast after another, all clean;
     The masts are as round as bamboo poles.
     The headquarters held a discussion,
     Discussing how to handle the task?
     Some said: Let's see how many trips we can make in a day?
     Some said: Let's try building a pontoon bridge.
     The headquarters decided to build a pontoon bridge,
     The sailors were very happy to hear it.
     The notification was sent to each company,
     Quickly punt the boats one by one.
     First drive the piles, then drag the cables,
     Drag them to the north bank and tie them to the trees.
     One by one, punt them all into place,
     Then quickly heave the large anchors into the river;
     Rope markers, axe cuts,
     Put up the supports, lay down the planks,
     Fill any gaps with wet soil;
     Place sorghum stalks on both sides,
     Connecting all the way to the south bank.
     This pontoon bridge is built,
     The pontoon bridge is built very carefully.
     Although the pontoon bridge is well built,
     We are still afraid of the danger of rising water;
     The detachment leader, the political instructor,
     The company commander, the political officer,
     All the cadres are on duty,
     Watching the boats day and night without rest,
     Every sailor stays on the boat.
     Working diligently day and night to guard strictly,
     Waiting for the Fourth Field Army to cross the Yellow River to Henan.
     The Fourth Field Army crosses the river,
     Cooperating with Liu-Deng and Chen-Su's armies to go south of the Yangtze River.
     The entire army crosses the river,
     For the sake of the masses south of the Yangtze to liberate themselves.
     To the south of the Yangtze,
     Capture the old thief Chiang Kai-shek,
     Bring him to the rear to punish him,
     Dig up all the roots and sprouts of Chiang,
     For the people's happiness for ten thousand years.
    Note: The people of Hebei, Shandong and Henan provinces, with the highest degree of enthusiasm for supporting the national liberation war, created a great miracle unprecedented in history - building the great Yellow River pontoon bridge. The iron torrent of our Fourth Field Army, infantry, artillery, mechanized corps, was able to smoothly gallop south on this pontoon bridge as flat as a highway.

    搭好浮桥渡大军
     水手王安玉口述
     君谦笔记
     东北大军真勇敢，
     解放东北进了关；
     天津北平全解放，
     林将军率领大军过河南。
     黄河司令通知下：
     各大队里准备船。
     二大队，他从濮县把船开；
     七大队，他在齐河也开船。
     有了北风使船跑，
     无有北风拖上缆，
     连日加夜拉起船，
     前行来到寿张县。
     孙家口上接任务，
     孙家口上靠了船。
     二大队、四大队、七大队，
     三个大队，不知船只有多少？
     一根一根净桅杆；
     桅杆多似竹竿圆。
     司令部里开了讨论会，
     讨论任务怎样办？
     有的说：咱看一天能够渡几趟？
     有的说：咱把浮桥来试验。
     司令部里决议搭浮桥，
     水兵听了很喜欢。
     各中队里通知下，
     一只一只快撑船。
     先打桩，后拖缆，
     拖到北岸树上拴。
     一只一只撑齐备，
     忙把大锚河里掀；
     绳子标，斧头樱，
     架上翘，铺上板，
     有缝就用湿土漫；
     秫秸把儿摆两边，
     接接连连到南岸。
     这个浮桥搭成了，
     浮桥搭的很周全。
     浮桥虽然搭的好，
     还怕涨水出危险；
     大队长、教导员，
     中队长、指导员，
     各位干部来值班，
     昼夜不息把船看，
     各个水手不下船。
     昼夜勤劳防守严，
     单等四野战军过河南。
     四野战军把河过，
     配合刘邓、陈粟大军下江南。
     全体大军把河过，
     为的江南群众把身翻。
     到江南，
     拿住老贼蒋介石，
     带到后方俺惩办，
     蒋根蒋芽都掘掉，
     人民幸福万万年。
    按：冀鲁豫人民以最高度的支援全国解放战争的热情，创造了历史上空前未有的伟大奇迹——架起了黄河大浮桥。我第四野战军的铁流，步兵、炮兵、机械化兵团，从这平坦得象公路一般的浮桥上，得以顺利的奔驰南进。
