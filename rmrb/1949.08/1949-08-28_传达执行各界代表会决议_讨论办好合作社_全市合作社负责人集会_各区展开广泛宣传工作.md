　　Communicating and Implementing Resolutions of All Circles Representatives Conference
  　Discussing How to Run Cooperatives
    Citywide Cooperatives Leaders Gather
    All Districts Launch Extensive Propaganda Work
    [Reported by this newspaper] The cooperative sector representatives Wang Chun, Tang Zhongming, and Ma Zhongde, who participated in the Ping City All Circles Representatives Conference, convened a meeting of all cooperative leaders in the city at the City General Cooperative on the 26th to convey the resolutions of the All Circles Representatives Conference and propose future work tasks. At the meeting, Wang Chun first explained that because there are still special agent activities and disruptions by unscrupulous merchants, it is necessary to heighten vigilance and strengthen anti-espionage and anti-profiteering efforts. It is also necessary to vigorously develop cooperatives and establish a broad consumer network to stabilize market prices and combat unscrupulous merchants. The city's consumer cooperatives currently have 230,000 members, and the goal is to expand to 400,000. In the future, each cooperative must ensure the following points: 1. Establish and improve the representative meetings, implement true democratic management, and improve operations under the supervision of the masses. 2. Cooperatives are mass-based economic mutual aid organizations and cannot rely solely on government and factory assistance. It is necessary to strengthen member education and mobilize the organizational and economic strength of the masses. 3. It is imperative to ensure that transactions are not made with non-members and that illegal operations are avoided. 4. It is imperative to promote the style of hard work and serving the people, and to ensure that members feel that buying things is cheaper and more convenient in business operations. 5. It is imperative to humbly examine shortcomings, accept member criticism, cherish every grain of rice and every inch of cloth, and prevent grain from spoiling and equipment from being damaged. 6. It is imperative to overcome the profit-seeking mentality ideologically and focus everything on the interests of the members. Finally, he emphasized that the achievements of the consumer cooperatives in the past few months have been significant, especially in the distribution of grain, which has played a major role in the national economy and the interests of the members. Although it seems to be a routine work, it is actually implementing policies and consolidating the new social system. This is something that every comrade should understand theoretically. In the future, a model worker movement should be launched, and in the near future, work should be summarized and inspected, and model cooperative workers should be elected.
    Tang Zhongming and Ma Zhongde then made supplementary speeches, followed by a discussion, with the central question being how to run cooperatives well. The representatives of the various cooperatives spoke enthusiastically, reflecting many specific situations. Some factories and street offices provide good assistance to the cooperatives, but some individual factories want to abolish the democratically elected cooperative cadres and send their own people to run them; others do not pay attention to or help the cooperatives. Some cooperatives raised opinions to the general cooperative: 1. The grain price and the market price should maintain a certain distance. 2. Northeast millet and corn should be processed to improve quality. 3. It is hoped that members can take their membership cards directly to the trade company to buy goods. 4. It should be clearly stipulated how many members can have a cadre detached from production. 5. The business department should prepare a large amount of goods in a timely manner according to the season. 6. It is hoped that cooperative communications will be published to exchange experiences.
    Then, the person in charge of the cooperative of the Sixteenth Street of the Third District reported on the experience of building the cooperative, business operations, and how to contact the masses, which won unanimous praise from the audience and became an unexpected harvest of the conference. Everyone automatically asked for his address and wanted to take the time to learn from him. Finally, the discussion turned to the winter coal issue, and it was planned to set up coal briquette factories in each street cooperative this winter. Each cooperative can go back and convene a community committee to review past work in accordance with the new spirit, make a winter coal plan, and elect a correspondent to maintain regular contact.

    [Reported by this city] All districts of Ping City are enthusiastically launching the publicity work of the resolutions of the All Circles Representatives Conference of Beijing. The Third District held a mass meeting attended by more than 3,000 people on the evening of the 25th. Other districts have also been holding mass meetings in the past few days, with the public security police station as the unit, to convey the spirit and resolutions of the conference. The masses have also put forward their opinions on implementing the resolutions. Some workers in factories, shops, and organizations have also spontaneously organized propaganda teams to carry out street propaganda and spread the resolutions to the masses. The Seventh District has organized five street propaganda teams, composed of workers from units such as Yongxing Printing Factory, 1950s Publishing House, Six Nations Hotel, and Kailuan Mining Bureau. Activities began on the 25th of this month. After getting off work at 6:00 pm every day, they came out, led by gongs and drums, holding aloft three-dimensional slogans and cartoons made from the resolutions of the All Circles Representatives Conference, such as "Eliminate Special Agents," "Restore and Develop Production," and "Carry out Cultural Education." Workers dressed up as various characters, twirling the Yangko dance, and performing programs such as workers, farmers, and citizens denouncing special agents and mass education of unscrupulous merchants. Wherever the team passed, the masses gathered around. Everyone saw the special agents being allowed to register for self-renewal, and they educated the unscrupulous merchants not to speculate and resell. They all said: "Yes! Yes! That's how to do it!" The workers also made ten allegros, nine song lyrics, and one short play and one living newspaper drama around the resolutions of the All Circles Representatives Conference and performed them in the streets. After listening to them, the masses expressed their willingness to assist the government in exposing special agents. After the activities of the propaganda team in the past two days, the people in the streets were all talking about the issues of the All Circles Representatives Conference.
    [Reported by this city] The Fifth Standing Committee Meeting of the Ping City Primary and Secondary School Education Association decided to make a report to all primary and secondary school teachers and staff members in the city in accordance with the resolutions of the All Circles Representatives Conference of Beijing. It was decided to hold a communication meeting at 6:00 pm this (28th) afternoon in the large playground of Municipal No. 8 Middle School (formerly Si Cun Middle School). All primary and secondary school teachers and staff members will participate at that time.

　　传达执行各界代表会决议
  　讨论办好合作社
    全市合作社负责人集会
    各区展开广泛宣传工作
    【本报讯】参加平市各界代表会的合作部门代表王纯、唐仲鸣、马仲德等，于二十六日召集全市各合作社负责人在市总社开会，传达各界代表会决议，并提出今后工作任务。会上首由王纯说明：因为还有特务活动和奸商捣乱，所以必须提高警惕，加强防特防奸；更必须大力开展合作社，建立起广大的消费网，才能稳定市价，打击奸商。全市消费合作社现有社员二十三万，准备发展到四十万，今后各社要保证作到下列各点：一、建立健全代表会议，实行真正的民主管理，在群众监督下改进业务。二、合作社是群众性的经济互助组织，不能专靠政府与厂方帮助，必须加强社员教育，动员群众的组织力量和经济力量。三、必须保证不作非社员交易，不作违法经营。四、必须发扬艰苦奋斗为民服务的作风，在业务经营中使社员感到买东西便宜而又便利。五、必须虚心检查缺点，接受社员批评，爱护一粒米一寸布，不要使粮食霉坏，用具损失。六、必须从思想上克服营利观点，一切围绕社员利益。最后他强调提出，几个月来消费社的成绩是很大的，特别在分配粮食方面，对国家经济、社员利益起了很大作用，表面看来虽是个事务工作，但这就是执行了政策，巩固了新的社会制度，这是每个同志应从理论上加以认识。今后要开展模范工作者运动，在不久的将来，要总结检查工作，选举合作模范工作者。
    继由唐仲鸣、马仲德作补充发言，随后进行讨论：中心问题是合作社怎样才能办好。各合作社代表发言十分热烈，反映了许多具体情况：有的厂方及街公所对合作社帮助很好，但也有个别厂方想取消民选的社干自己派人办理；还有的对合作社不重视、不帮助。有的合作社对总社提出意见：一、粮价和市价要保持一定之距离，二、东北小米、玉米要加工，以提高质量；三、希望社员能拿社员证直接到贸易公司买货；四、多少社员即可设一脱离生产干部，希明确规定；五、营业部按季节性及时的准备好大量货物；六、希望出版合作通讯交流经验。
    接着，三区十六街合作社负责人报告建社经过、业务经营及如何联系群众的经验，获得全场一致的赞佩，成为大会意外的收获。大家都自动问他的住址，想抽时间去向他学习。最后讨论到冬季煤炭问题，打算今冬在各街道社普设煤球厂，各合作社回去可召开社委会，根据新的精神检查过去工作，作好冬季用煤计划，每社选出一位通讯员保持经常联系。（重）
    【本市讯】平市各区热烈展开北平市各界代表会议决议的宣传工作。三区在二十五日晚召开了三千余人参加的群众大会，其他各区连日亦均以公安派出所为单位召开群众会，传达大会精神和决议，群众并纷纷提出执行决议的意见。有的工厂、商店、机关团体的职工，还自动组织了宣传队，出动街头宣传，把各项决议传播到群众中去。七区共编组了五个街头宣传队，由永兴印刷厂、五十年代出版社、六国饭店、开滦矿务局等单位的职工组成。从本月二十五日起就开始活动，在每天下午六时下班以后出来，由锣鼓引导前行，高举着各界代表会的“肃清特务”、“恢复发展生产”、“开展文化教育”等决议做成的立体标语和漫画，工友们化装成各色各样的人物，扭着秧歌，表演着工人、农民、市民痛斥特务和群众教育奸商等节目。队伍过处，群众都围拢起来，大家看见让特务自新登记，教育奸商不要投机倒把，都说：“对！对！就是这么做！”工友们还围绕着各界代表会决议做了十篇快板、九首歌词，还有短剧、活报剧各一个，在街头演唱。群众听了以后，都表示愿意协助政府检举特务分子。经过这两天宣传队的活动，街头苍尾都在谈论各界代表会的问题。
    【本市讯】平市中小学教联第五次常委会议决，根据北平市各界代表会议决议，向全市中小学教职员同人作传达报告，并定于今（二十八）日下午六时在市立八中（原四存中学）大操场举行传达会，届时全体中小学教职员均将参加。
