    Inner District One Dredges Paozi River
    Residents on Both Banks Spared from Flooding
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Paozi River in Inner District One is the only river that gathers rainwater from the southeast city wall. During the Kuomintang's rule, not only was it not dredged, but a large amount of garbage and filth was transported there to fill it. Therefore, every rainy season, the banks of the Paozi River turned into a swamp, with many houses collapsing and frequent deaths and injuries occurring. Recently, due to continuous rain, the banks of the Paozi River were again flooded, with more than thirty houses collapsing. Although the Construction Bureau's engineering team worked hard to excavate it for days, it still required several days to complete. The 18th Police Station of the Inner District One Branch Bureau and the heads of various resident groups, in order to complete the river dredging as soon as possible and avoid flooding again in case of more rain, decided temporarily on the evening of the 6th to call on residents within the jurisdiction of the 18th Police Station to cooperate with the Construction Bureau's engineering team for emergency repairs on a voluntary mutual assistance basis during the Sunday holiday on the 7th. That evening, more than seventy people automatically signed up to participate, some willing to dig for a day, some for half a day, and some for an hour.
    On the morning of the 7th, the 150-meter section of the river from Kuijia Factory to Nancheng Gen was crowded with more than 100 people with shovels, picks, and hoes. Some were building dams, some were digging ditches, and some were carrying earth, talking, laughing, and working enthusiastically. The cadres and police of the 18th Police Station took on the more difficult section of the stinky ditch; skilled workers from the engineering team provided guidance while working. Even passers-by joined in the work. About 200 people participated in total, and in less than seven hours, the entire 150-meter-long, two-foot-wide, and three-foot-deep waterway was completely dredged. When the last dam was breached and the water of the Paozi River rushed towards the moat with a rushing sound, a burst of enthusiastic cheers erupted on both banks of the river.

    工人警员居民齐动手
    内一区挖通泡子河
    两岸居民免除水患
    【本报讯】内一区泡子河，是东南城根雨水汇聚的唯一河流，国民党统治时，不仅不动工疏通，而且还把垃圾秽土大量运往里面填塞，因此，每年雨季泡子河两岸便变成了泽国，房屋大量倒塌，还常有死伤事故发生。最近，由于雨水连绵，泡子河两岸又积水盈尺，房子倒塌三十余处之多，虽经建设局工程队连日赶工开凿，仍须数日始能完成。内一分局第十八派出所与各居民小组长为了使疏河早日完成，以免再下雨时又闹水，于是在六日晚临时决议，利用七日星期休假期间，号召十八派出所境内居民，在自愿互助的原则下，配合建设局工程队加工抢修。当晚即有七十余人自动报名参加，有愿挖一天，挖半天的，挖一点钟的不等。
    七日早晨，从盔甲厂到南城根一段一百五十余公尺的河面，便被一百多拿铁锹、铁镐、锄头的群众挤满了。有的砌坝，有的挖沟，有的抬土，说说笑笑，愉快热烈的干着。十八派出所的干部警察，担任了比较艰苦的一段臭水坑；工程队的熟练工人一面作一面负责指导。甚至行人也有参加工作的。前后参加的约二百人，不到七小时的工夫，全长一百五十余公尺，宽二尺、深三尺的河道，便全部挖通。当最后一个坝被挖开，泡子河的水哗哗哗地向着护城河涌出去时，河堤两岸掀起了一片热烈地欢呼声。
