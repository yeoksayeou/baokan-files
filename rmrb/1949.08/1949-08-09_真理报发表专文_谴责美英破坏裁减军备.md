    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 8th: Moscow dispatch: *Pravda* recently published an article by Viktorov entitled "US and UK Undermining Disarmament," stating: "On July 29th, the representatives, dominated by the US representative, in the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, passed a decision to suspend the work of the commission indefinitely. On August 1st, due to pressure from the US and UK group representatives, the United Nations Commission for Conventional Armaments also suspended its work. Neither of these committees completed the tasks assigned to them."

    Viktorov emphasized: "The almost simultaneous cessation of work by these two important UN committees is a direct result of the policy of undermining disarmament that the US and UK group has followed for a long time. This is clearly recorded in the complete records of the two committees."

    "As everyone knows, the issues of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons were raised by the Soviet Union in the United Nations as a primary task. This noble proposal of the Soviet Union was unanimously supported by the people of all countries because it conformed to their desire for lasting peace and security and the elimination of the threat of a new war. The Soviet proposal was also supported by the United Nations General Assembly. At that time, the representatives of the US and UK group, fearing exposure, did not dare to come out and openly oppose the Soviet proposal. However, they chose a policy of undermining disarmament, attempting to use the two committees—the Atomic Energy Commission and the Commission for Conventional Armaments—to achieve their selfish goals."

    "In order to achieve the goal of undermining disarmament, the US and UK group deliberately created conditions that could lead to the cessation of the committees' activities."

    "Logically, if atomic weapons are the crux of the problem, then atomic weapons must first be prohibited, and only after that can a mechanism be established to implement this prohibition. However, the US representative insisted that such control must be established before atomic weapons are prohibited. In other words, they are proposing to establish control over a resolution that has not yet been passed. More importantly, neither the United States nor the United Kingdom has put forward practical proposals for reducing armaments and prohibiting atomic weapons."

    "In contrast to the US and UK group, the Soviet Union proposed a draft convention on the prohibition of atomic weapons on June 19, 1946, and another convention on June 11, 1947—to establish effective control over atomic energy production. In order to end the dispute over which convention should be formulated first, the Soviet Union then proposed formulating both conventions simultaneously."

    "If the Soviet proposal were adopted, it would represent a major step forward in consolidating peace and international security. But this is precisely why US and British imperialism is vehemently opposed to these proposals."

    Viktorov, after recounting other disarmament proposals put forward by the Soviet Union, went on to emphasize: "All these proposals, although praised by all those who truly advocate peace, have been rejected by the US and UK group."

    Viktorov pointed out: "The US ruling group, after refusing to truly disarm, decided to use the Commission for Conventional Armaments to gather military intelligence. The fact of rejecting the Soviet proposal to prohibit atomic weapons and disarm exposed to the world the long-term aggressive goals pursued by the Anglo-American group. When the US ruling group realized that their attempt to turn the UN committee into a tool manipulated by the United States was about to fail, they adopted a policy of ceasing the committee's work."

    The author asked: "Why is it precisely now that the US and UK group is forcing the two important UN committees to cease their work?" The author answered this question by saying: "On the one hand, the North Atlantic military bloc has been established, and Truman's new plan to rearm Western European countries is fueling an increasingly intensified arms race. These and many other facts show that the warmongers are becoming increasingly aggressive. On the other hand, the plans of the US and British imperialists are facing increasing resistance from the powerful movement of the American people demanding universal peace. In this situation, the bigwigs of the US and UK group are more afraid than anything else of discussing the Soviet proposal to prohibit atomic weapons and disarm."

    Viktorov concluded: "The US and UK group has exposed themselves. The leaders of the US and UK group have admitted the aggressive nature of their policy against peace and the United Nations."

    谴责美英破坏裁减军备
    【新华社北平八日电】莫斯科讯：真理报顷发表维克托洛夫所作“美英破坏裁减军备”一文称：七月二十九日，联合国原子能委员会中以美国代表为首的占据多数地位的代表们，通过了无限期停止委员会工作的决定。八月一日由于美英集团的代表所施的压力，联合国普通军备委员会亦停止工作。这两个委员会都没有完成交给它们的任务。
    维克托洛夫着重指出：这两个重要的联合国委员会几乎同时停止工作，是美英集团很久以来就遵循破坏裁减军备的政策的直接结果。这一点，在两个委员会的全部纪录上是记载得明明白白的。
    尽人皆知，裁减军备与禁止原子武器的问题，是由苏联在联合国中当作主要任务提出的。苏联这个高尚的建议，受到各国人民的一致拥护，因为它合乎他们要求持久和平与安全及消除新战争威胁的愿望。苏联的建议也受到联合国大会的支持。当时，美英集团的代表害怕暴露自己，不敢冒险出来公开反对苏联的建议。但是，它们选择了破坏裁减军备的方针，企图利用两个委员会——原子能委员会与普通军备委员会来达到它们利己的目的。
    美英集团为了达到破坏裁减军备的目的，就故意制造一些可以促使委员会停止活动的条件。
    按道理讲，如果原子武器是问题的症结所在，那么，首先就必须禁止原子武器，而且，只有这样做了之后，才能再建立实施这种禁令的管制。但是，美国代表坚持：必须在禁止原子武器以前，就建立这种管制。换句话说：他们是建议对于尚未通过之决议建立的实施管制。更重要的是，不论是美国或英国，都没有提出缩减军备与禁止原子武器的切合实际的建议。
    与美英集团相反，苏联在一九四六年六月十九日提出了禁止原子武器的公约草案，并在一九四七年六月十一日提出了另外一个公约——建立原子能生产的有效管制。为了结束应该先制定那一个公约而发生的争执，苏联于是建议同时制定两种公约。
    如果通过了苏联的建议，那就表示在巩固和平与国际安全上前进了一大步。但是，这也正是美英帝国主义为什么要张牙舞爪地反对这些建议的原因。
    维克托洛夫在追述苏联提出的其他裁减军备的建议之后，进而着重提出：所有这些建议，虽然受到一切真正赞助和平的人们的称道，但是，却都被美英集团拒绝了。
    维克托洛夫指出：美国统治集团，在拒绝真正裁减军备之后，决定利用普通军备委员会来搜集军事情报。拒绝苏联所提禁止原子武器与裁减军备的建议这件事实，向全世界暴露了英美集团所追求的长远的侵略目的。当美国统治集团认定他们变联合国委员会为美国操纵指使的工具的企图要失败的时候，他们就采取了停止委员会工作的方针。
    作者问道：为什么恰好在现在，美英集团迫使联合国的两个重要委员会停止工作呢？作者答复这个问题说：一方面，北大西洋军事集团成立了，杜鲁门的重新武装西欧国家的新计划，助长了日益加紧的军备竞赛，这些和其他的许多事实，显示战争贩子越来越富于侵略性了。另一方面，美英帝国主义者的计划，却受到美国人民群众要求普遍和平的强有力的运动的日益增长的抵抗。在这种情况下，美英集团的要人们，对于讨论禁止原子武器与裁减军备的苏联建议，害怕得比什么都要厉害。
    维克托洛夫结语称：美英集团已经暴露了它们自己。美英集团的领袖们承认了他们反对和平与联合国的政策的侵略性质。
