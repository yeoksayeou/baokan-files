　　[Broadcast by Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station] Hankou, 25th – The Wuchang to Changsha section of the Yuehan Railway has been fully restored to traffic recently, thanks to the emergency repairs carried out by the People's Liberation Army, railway workers, and local people.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 25th] External transportation from Changsha is gradually being restored. Wireless telephone communication between Changsha and Nanjing and Nanchang has been restored since the 18th. The Hunan Provincial Navigation Bureau was established on the 17th. Eighteen public and private ships, seized from Wuhan by the White bandits but protected from destruction by the crew in various ways, have sailed back from their hiding places and have all resumed service. Passenger and freight transport on the six highways from Changsha to Nanchang, Wuchang, Changde, etc., also resumed on the 8th. When the Kuomintang bandit troops retreated along the Wuchang-Changsha highway, the White bandits ordered all bridges to be burned. Thanks to the efforts of the farmers along the route, most of the bridges were preserved. The small number of bridges destroyed by the bandits are being urgently repaired by the People's Liberation Army with the assistance of farmers in Changsha.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 25th] Changde, an important town in western Hunan, has seen a rapid recovery in commerce and transportation since its liberation on the 29th of last month. Before the liberation of the city, it suffered severe looting by the fleeing Kuomintang bandit troops of the Provisional 5th Division, and merchants and residents fled with their goods. After liberation, merchants and residents returned to resume their businesses. In the first few days after liberation, vehicles and boats loaded with goods poured back into the city from the surrounding countryside in an endless stream. In less than a week, more than half of the city's businesses had reopened. The liberation of Changsha and the gradual restoration of transportation and remittance services with Hankou and other places have made the Changde market more active, and prices are becoming more stable. Regular passenger ships between Changde and Changsha and Taoyuan have officially resumed service. The "New Song Yuan" ship sailed directly to Hankou on the 12th. The Chang (de)-Chang (sha) highway, which was severely damaged by the bandit troops, was also restored to traffic on the 20th, thanks to the day and night repairs by the People's Liberation Army and the local people. The Chang (de)-Sha (shi) highway had already been restored to traffic one day earlier (the 19th). At present, the Transportation Takeover Office of the Changde Military Control Commission is actively organizing water and land passenger and freight transportation with Changsha, Hankou and other places to promote the rapid recovery of Changde's industry and commerce. As for Changde's telecommunications and postal services, thanks to the heroic protection and hard work of all the staff, they were able to provide telephone and postal services to all liberated areas on the first day after liberation.

　　粤汉路武昌长沙段通车长沙常德对外交通恢复
    【北平新华广播电台广播】汉口二十五号消息：粤汉铁路武昌到长沙段，经人民解放军，该路职工和当地人民的抢修，最近已经全部恢复通车。
    【新华社长沙二十五日电】长沙对外交通正在逐渐恢复。长沙至南京和南昌的无线电话已自十八日起恢复。湖南省航务局已于十七日成立。被白匪从武汉抓来、在船员多方保护之下得以免遭破坏的十八艘公私轮船，已自隐蔽地驶回，并已全部复航。长沙至南昌、武昌、常德等六线公路客货运输，八日起亦已恢复。国民党匪军沿武昌至长沙公路线撤退时，白匪曾下令将所有桥梁一律焚毁。经沿线农民尽力保护，大部桥梁得以保全。被匪破坏的一小部分桥梁，正为在长沙农民协助下的解放军抢修中。
    【新华社长沙二十五日电】湘西重镇常德于上月二十九日解放后，商业和交通都已迅速恢复中。——该城解放前夕，曾惨遭溃逃的蒋匪军暂编第五师的严重抢劫，商民携带货物逃避一空。解放后，商民纷纷返回复业。满载着货物的车辆、船只，在刚解放的几天中，络绎不绝地从四乡涌回城市。不到一周，全城商号开门营业的即已超过半数。长沙的解放和与汉口等地交通、汇兑的逐步恢复，使常德市面更见活跃，物价亦日趋平稳。常德与长沙、桃源间的班轮已正式复航。“新宋源”号轮船已于十二日直航汉口。遭匪军严重破坏的常（德）长（沙）公路，在解放军和当地人民的日夜抢修下，也在二十日恢复通车。常（德）沙（市）公路先一日（十九日）即已恢复通车。现常市军管会交通接管处正积极组织与长沙、汉口等地的水陆客货运输，以促进常市工商业的迅速恢复。至于常市电信、邮政，由于全体职工的英勇保护和努力工作，解放后第一天就已与解放区各地通电通邮。
