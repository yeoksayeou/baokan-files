    Chaoyang College Students' Accusation of Spies Case
    Court Trial Concluded
    Two Spies Sentenced to Indeterminate Imprisonment

    [Our Dispatch] The People's Court of Beiping City accepted the accusations of all students against spies Wang Yukun and Sha Fenghong at the accusation meeting at Chaoyang College on June 5th, and arrested the spies. After more than two months of trial, the court, based on the lenient policy of the People's Government, sentenced spies Wang Yukun and Sha Fenghong to flexible indeterminate imprisonment.

    Wang Yukun, from Tang County, Hebei Province, was from a landlord family. He studied at Ping City's Zhonghua Middle School and Zhicheng Middle School. Because he often got into fights, he met Dou Shiming, a Kuomintang secret agent, who introduced him to the Kuomintang and made him a spy. On October 20, 1945, he was ordered by Dou to break into a Normal University meeting with other spies and beat the students. In April 1948, when students from Peking University, Tsinghua University, and other schools were demonstrating against persecution and hunger, the spies planned to sabotage the demonstrations, creating so-called "counter-demonstrations." Wang Yukun actively participated, beating demonstrators regardless of gender and taking them away in cars after the beatings. Later, he met his old friend Sha Fenghong on the street, who introduced him to Wang Zhen and other spies at Chaoyang College. Wang Yukun then audited classes at Chaoyang College and often beat people with large wooden sticks. On December 2nd, after a Chaoyang student was released from the fake Special Criminal Court, a group of spies gathered many people with pistols, wooden sticks, and iron bars to unreasonably search the dormitory, brutally beating students. They also privately set up a special criminal court in Nanpingfang, detaining and interrogating students, and forging evidence to send some progressive students to the fake police bureau's Special Criminal Court, seizing the students' food and belongings. This persecution lasted for two weeks. Over two hundred students were injured by the spies, including Wang Yukun, some of whom were covered in wounds, with broken heads and arms, vomiting blood, and fainting. Wang Tieying, Yuan Guangya, and four others were sent to the fake criminal court, while Zhou Xinghai, Hua Shangzhi, and seven others were sent to the fake Paoju "Youth Training Team." In addition, Wang Yukun and Sha Fenghong also bullied merchants outside the school. Last December, they forcibly took ten bags of flour from the Daqing Rice Shop, brought the accountant Wang Mingjie to Nanpingfang, and beat him with sticks. The next day, they destroyed the rice shop, looted property, and injured shop assistant Huang Shougang. They also used their power to "fine" shops fifteen catties of beef and injured student Zhang Wenli at Huiwen Middle School. Wang and Sha also conspired to steal six bags of flour from Chaoyang students and brutally beat a rickshaw puller for hiring a rickshaw. All of the above crimes have been confessed to. The People's Court, considering their youth and hoping that they can repent and start anew, sentenced Wang Yukun to indeterminate imprisonment of three to eight years and Sha Fenghong to two to five years.

    两特务均判活期徒刑
    【本报讯】北平市人民法院于六月五日曾在朝阳学院控诉大会上，受理全院同学对特务分子王玉昆、沙凤鸿等之控诉，并将特务分子捕押，经过两个多月之审理，法院根据人民政府之宽大政策，分别判处特务分子王玉昆、沙凤鸿以有伸缩性之活期徒刑。
    王玉昆，河北唐县人，地主成份，曾在平市中华中学、志成中学上学，因平素好打架认识了中统特务分子窦世明，由窦介绍参加了中统，充当特务，一九四五年十月二十日曾奉窦的命令，偕同其他特务多人，闯进师大会场将开会学生一阵乱打。一九四八年四月正值北大、清华等校同学作反迫害、反饥饿的游行，特务分子曾作有计划的破坏，制造所谓“反游行示威”，王玉昆积极参加了，对游行者不问男女均加毒打，打后用汽车载走。后在街头与旧日友人沙凤鸿相遇，经沙的介绍认识了朝阳学院特务王镇等多人，王玉昆遂入朝院学校旁听，时常用大木棍打人。十二月二日朝阳一位同学被伪特刑庭释放出狱，一伙特务知道后，随即纠集多人手持手枪、木棍、铁棒等无理搜查宿舍，毒打同学，并在南平房私设特刑庭，拘禁刑讯同学，并伪造证据，把一部分进步同学送往伪警察局特刑庭，把同学们的粮食、物品强占。这种迫害行为连续两周之久，被特务分子王玉昆打伤的同学达二百余人，有的被打得遍体鳞伤，头破臂断，吐血昏迷。被打后送往伪刑庭者有王铁英、袁光亚等六人，送往伪炮局“青训队”者有周星海、花尚之等七人。此外，王玉昆、沙凤鸿在校外亦仗势欺压商民，去年十二月间强行拉走大庆米庄面粉十袋，把司帐王明杰带到南平房用棍棒乱打，次日并将该米庄打毁，抢走财物，打伤店员黄受刚。仗势“罚”过店铺牛肉十五斤，还在汇文中学打伤学生张文礼。王、沙二人又同谋偷了朝阳同学面粉六袋，因雇三轮而暴打三轮车工人等。以上罪恶事实，均经一一供认，人民法院念其青年，冀其能悔改自新，判处王玉昆活期徒刑三年至八年，沙凤鸿二年至五年。（光）
