　　【Ping City News】Gao Jixiang, a bandit from Huolu County, Hebei Province, who destroyed electrical wires, has been captured by the government and sentenced to death. This criminal had previously participated in the Kuomintang bandit army and was captured and released after education when Shijiazhuang was liberated. However, he did not repent and instead colluded with six other released Kuomintang bandit soldiers from the same village, including Gao Erqiu, Gao Yanlin, and Zhu Deshan, to form a bandit gang and disrupt transportation. From May to August of last year, the principal culprit Gao Jixiang organized Gao Erqiu, Gao Yanlin, and Gao Zhenyi to steal electrical wires a total of ten times, damaging eighty-two holes and obtaining more than four hundred pounds of electrical wire, which was sold for ＠fen. In September, Gao and others attempted to kill district cadre Liang Lianshan to obtain his gun in order to seize weapons from our militia for robbery. This attempt failed due to lack of opportunity. Later, Gao Jixiang colluded with Li Quanzi, Zhu Deshan, and others to rob bicycles on the road using fake guns. When village chief Liu Bayue discovered Gao Erqiu stealing public grain and detained him, the criminals harbored resentment and plotted to kill the village chief, but failed. The Huolu County government arrested the ringleader Gao Jixiang, and the North China People's Government has approved his death sentence. The remaining fugitives are being pursued rigorously. The North China People's Government has also specifically instructed the county government to conduct widespread propaganda and education among the masses, launch a mass movement to eliminate special agents and bandits, stabilize social order, and protect the people's property and transportation construction.
