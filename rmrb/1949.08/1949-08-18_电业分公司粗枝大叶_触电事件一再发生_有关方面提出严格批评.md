　　The Electric Power Branch Company's Carelessness
  　Leads to Repeated Electrocution Incidents
  　Relevant Parties Issue Stern Criticism
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] After the liberation of Beiping, the Beiping Electric Power Branch Company took over the bureaucratic enterprise structure left by the Kuomintang. Through the efforts of all employees, they overcame various difficulties, repaired lines, restored full power supply, and ensured that there were no power outages in the city for several months, which is good. However, in their work, there are still some careless and irresponsible work habits, resulting in several electrocution incidents. According to statistics from the Public Security Bureau, in July, nine people died from electrocution, and there were several instances of electrical fires. The reasons are: (1) Most of the utility poles and wires are dilapidated and cannot withstand continuous rainy days, making it easy to cause danger. (2) Many people lack knowledge about electricity, leading to electrocution. (3) The leadership of the branch company's work style is not serious enough; they fail to regularly inspect and repair lines, and when problems occur, they do not conduct thorough inspections after repairs. Some of these reasons cannot be overcome at present, and some are due to people's lack of knowledge, but the third reason is the responsibility of the electric power company to prevent. The fact that Zuo Jujang, a worker at the Sino-French University, died from electrocution is enough to illustrate how this careless work style can kill people. At 9:20 PM on July 30th, four utility poles, along with wires and a transformer, near the entrance of Sino-French University, collapsed due to rain, and high-voltage wires were spread across a hundred-meter-long street. The student union immediately notified the Beiping Electric Power Branch Company for repairs and organized a picket line to guard the buildings on both sides of the road, prohibiting pedestrians from passing to avoid danger. Repair workers Zhang Guangfu, Chen Dachun, and Wu @sheng cut off two lines of collapsed wires, but neglected the complexity of the wiring there and did not conduct a detailed inspection, and then went elsewhere. Ten minutes later, a scream was suddenly heard outside. Students and workers rushed out and found worker Zuo Jujang, who was returning from outside, lying in the water. The students used wooden poles to pull Zuo out, and a high-voltage wire was bouncing under the deceased. Only then did they realize that the repair workers from the Electric Power Branch Company had not completely cut off the power supply, resulting in the unfortunate death of worker Zuo Jujang.
    Before liberation, the Electric Light Company was a bureaucratic enterprise of the Kuomintang. When someone died from electrocution, they would not take any responsibility regardless of the circumstances. The manager's office often had legal counsel, and it was useless for the family to sue if anyone died from electrocution. After liberation, the Electric Power Branch Company belongs to the people. After the death of worker Zuo Jujang of Sino-French University, the Sino-French University Trade Union and Student Union demanded the Electric Power Branch Company to investigate responsibility and provide compensation to the bereaved family. This newspaper also sent people to inquire. Initially, individual responsible comrades in the administrative leadership of the Electric Power Branch Company emphasized objective difficulties, saying: During the Kuomintang rule, they were not responsible for deaths from electrocution. After liberation, our business regulations should have a way to solve the problem, but there is no such clause now. There are more than 30,000 wooden utility poles in Beiping that have been damaged and may pose a danger, but we do not have the power to replace them with new ones. At the same time, accidents are prone to occur during the rainy season, making it difficult to avoid deaths and injuries. After criticism from relevant departments, the branch company has made a self-criticism in recent days and decided on measures to avoid similar incidents in the future. It is hoped that the leaders of the company can follow the spirit of the self-criticism, improve their thinking and work, and better serve the people. (Guang)

### 电业分公司粗枝大叶　触电事件一再发生　有关方面提出严格批评

　　电业分公司粗枝大叶
  　触电事件一再发生
  　有关方面提出严格批评
    【本报特讯】平市解放后，北平电业分公司接受了国民党遗留下来的一套官僚企业机构，经过全体职工的努力，克服了各种困难，抢修线路，恢复了全面送电，并保证数月来全市没有停电，这是好的。但在工作中，仍然存在着某些粗枝大叶不负责任的工作作风，致造成若干触电事件。本报根据公安局部分材料统计，七月份因触电身死者九人，电线滋火数起，原因：（一）大部电杆电线残破，经不起连日阴雨，容易发生危险。（二）很多人缺乏电的常识，以致触电。（三）分公司领导上工作作风不够认真，不能经常检查线路进行修理，一旦问题发生时，修理后又不能精细的检查。以上原因，有的是目前还不能克服的，有的则是由于人们缺乏常识所致，但第三种原因则是电业公司方面应当负责防止的。中法大学工友邹巨江触电身死的事实，足可说明这种粗枝大叶的作风害死人。七月三十日晚九点二十分，中法大学门口四根电线杆连同电线及一个变压器因雨倾倒，百米长的大街上布满了高压电线，学生会当时一面电知北平电业分公司进行修理，一面立即组织纠察队，在马路两头的楼上守卫，禁止行人通过，以免发生危险。分公司修理工人张广福、陈大纯、武＠生把两路倾倒的电线剪断后，疏忽了此处线路的复杂性，并没做详细的检查，随即到其他地方去了。过了十分钟后，忽然听到外面一声惨叫，学生、工人赶紧跑出门外，发现从外面回来的工友邹巨江卧倒水中，同学们用木棒将邹抬出，一根高压线在死者身下弹击，这时才知道电业分公司的修理工人，没有把电源完全剪断，致使工友邹巨江身遭不幸。
    未解放前，电灯公司是国民党的官僚企业，触电死人他是不分什么情况一概不负责任的，经理室经常住有法律顾问，任何人触电身死家属起诉是无用的。解放后电业分公司已属人民所有。当中法大学工友邹巨江死后，中法大学工会、学生会向电业分公司提出追究责任，抚恤难属，本报也曾派人前去探询，电业分公司行政领导上个别负责同志起初还强调客观困难说：在国民党统治时期触电死人，他是概不负责的，解放后我们营业章程上应当有解决问题的办法，但是现在没有这样一条，北平市有三万余木电杆已经残毁，均会发生危险，可是我们没有力量换新的，同时雨季又易发生事故，很难避免死伤事件。后经有关部门提出批评，分公司在日前已作了检讨，并决定今后避免再发生此类事件的办法。希望该公司领导上能依照检讨书的精神，提高思想与工作，更好的为人民服务。（光）
