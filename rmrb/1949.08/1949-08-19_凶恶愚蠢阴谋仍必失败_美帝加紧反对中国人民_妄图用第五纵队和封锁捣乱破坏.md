Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: After publishing the White Paper on China, the US government is intensifying its conspiracies against the Chinese people. On August 6th, US Secretary of State Acheson made a statement, announcing five "guiding principles" for US policy toward China and then stated: The State Department "is taking some concrete steps toward this goal." Acheson also announced the appointment of a special Far East Study Group, chaired by the editor-in-chief of the White Paper, Ambassador-at-Large Jessup. Rockefeller Foundation Chairman Fosdick and Colgate University President Case will serve as advisors to the group. According to sources from the US State Department, several departments of the US government will soon discuss the Far East and China issues. Stuart, who returned to Washington on the 10th of this month, will participate in this important consultation. The "concrete steps" that Acheson said would be taken to oppose the new People's China, it is revealed will include encouraging and assisting so-called "Chinese democratic individualists" to engage in anti-communist activities, encouraging and assisting bandits and secret agents within the new People's China to engage in sabotage and disruption, assisting individual warlords of the Kuomintang to put up a last-ditch resistance, and implementing blockades against the new People's China, etc. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 6th: US officials revealed that one of the important policies of Acheson's new measures toward China is to "use every opportunity to weaken the position of communism within China - to encourage and assist any movement in China that wants to break away from communism and restore 'independence' (referring to restoring it as a US colony) wherever feasible," including "assisting any underground forces (referring to bandits and secret agents) that have developed in Communist China (referring to the new People's Democratic China)." Another Associated Press dispatch from New York on the 11th reported: "The State Department is studying whether it is possible to help individual Chinese (referring to the Kuomintang) generals and warlords establish a front in unconquered China (referring to the areas to be liberated), thereby establishing two regions in China as in Europe." The same news also said: "Acheson has asked his special committee to closely study the extent to which Communist China is dependent on Western trade. This dependence can be used as a weapon to restrain China, like the ban on exports to Eastern Europe." In addition, Jessup stated in a broadcast on the China issue on the 6th of this month: The US government will continue to consult with other imperialist countries that have colonies in the Far East on how to deal with the new People's Democratic China. This action by the American imperialists not only shows their ferocity, but also their stupidity. They fantasize that the Chinese people, whom large-scale wars could not conquer, can be conquered by fifth columnists and blockades.

　　凶恶愚蠢阴谋仍必失败
  　美帝加紧反对中国人民
    妄图用第五纵队和封锁捣乱破坏
    【新华社北平十八日电】美国政府在发表中国问题白皮书后，正加紧反对中国人民的阴谋活动。美国务卿艾奇逊本月六日发表谈话，在宣布五项对华政策“指导原则”之后称：国务院“正朝此目标采取若干具体步骤”。艾奇逊并宣布已任命一特别的远东研究小组，由白皮书总编辑、无任所大使耶塞普主持。洛克菲勒基金委员会主席福斯狄克及柯尔格特大学校长凯士两人则担任该小组顾问。据美国务院传出，美政府若干部门即将会商远东及中国问题；于本月十日返抵华盛顿的司徒雷登，将参加此项重要会商。艾奇逊所说将要采取的反对人民新中国的“具体步骤”，据透露将包括鼓励和援助所谓的“中国民主的个人主义者”进行反共活动，鼓励和援助人民新中国以内的土匪特务进行捣乱破坏，援助国民党的个别地方军阀进行垂死抵抗，以及对人民新中国实施对锁等等。据路透社华盛顿六日电称：美国负责官员透露，艾奇逊的对华新措施的重要方针之一是“利用一切机会削弱共产主义在中国内部的地位——在任何可以行得通的地方，鼓励和援助中国欲脱离共产主义而恢复“独立”（按指欲恢复作为美国的殖民地）的任何运动”，其中“包括援助在共产党中国（指人民民主新中国）发展起来的任何地下势力（按指土匪特务之类）在内”。另据美联社纽约十一日电报道：“国务院正在研究是否可能帮助单个的中国（按指国民党）将领和军阀在未被征服的中国（按指待解放区）建立一个战线，从而在中国象在欧洲一样建立两个地区。”同一消息又说：“艾奇逊已要求他的特别委员会密切研究共产党中国对西方贸易依赖到什么程度。这种依赖可被用作抑制中国的武器，象禁止对东欧的出口的禁令一样。”此外，耶塞普在本月六日发表的对中国问题广播中表示：美国政府将继续与在远东拥有殖民地的其他帝国主义国家谘商对付人民民主新中国的办法。美国帝国主义者的这种行动，不但表示了自己的凶恶，也表示了自己的愚蠢。他们幻想着：大规模战争所不能征服的中国人民，可以用第五纵队和封锁来征服。
