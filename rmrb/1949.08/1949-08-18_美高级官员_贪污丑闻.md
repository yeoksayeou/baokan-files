Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 16th: TASS, New York, August 13th: American newspapers continue to publish news of the Senate Committee's investigation into the malfeasance of senior U.S. officials in signing government contracts. The newspapers also published a statement by White House Press Secretary Ross, who claimed he knew nothing about reports that Mrs. Truman and several government officials had accepted valuable refrigerators as gifts from Chicago capitalists. The New York Herald Tribune editorial said: Truman has dismissed his military aide, Major General Vaughan, who had been condemned for colluding privately with capitalists.

  　贪污丑闻
    【新华社北平十六日电】塔斯社纽约十三日讯：美国报纸继续刊载参院委员会调查美国高级官员在签订政府合同时营私舞弊的消息。报纸并发表白宫新闻秘书罗斯的声明，他声称对外传杜鲁门夫人与若干政府官员接受芝加哥资本家贵重冰箱赠礼一事，毫无所悉。纽约先驱论坛报社论说：杜鲁门已撤去他的军事助手渥汉少将的职务，后者曾被谴责私下勾结资本家。
