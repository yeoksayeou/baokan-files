    Reading "Chinese Physics"
    Xu Teli
    I have read "Chinese Physics" once, but I dare not express any definite opinions due to a lack of the necessary physics knowledge. However, I intuitively feel that natural science in past Chinese society lacked an industrial base, so that experimental achievements stopped at publications and did not receive the material assistance of industrialists and the encouragement of social opinion, while those who appreciated the more profound academic papers were abroad. As a result, many theoretical scientific works were only published in English or in a combination of Chinese and English. This shows the tragic fate of Chinese scientists before today, a fate that is only now beginning to be reversed. Naturally, at present, when the political revolution is about to be completed and the industrial revolution has yet to begin systematically, the profound works of physical theorists can only participate in leadership or assistant work with the industrial revolution to have a future.
    In science education, physics and chemistry are the theoretical foundations of all natural sciences, and physics is the theoretical foundation of chemistry. Due to the two extremes of China's science education, ordinary education is very backward, and the education from research institutes to primary and secondary schools is vastly different. Therefore, Chinese scientists have become "airborne ancestors," with no proper place on the Chinese territory on Earth. The broad masses who have been liberated from hell today urgently need scientific knowledge to carry out the industrial revolution, which requires both popularization and improvement. The best way for scientists who have become famous at home and abroad is to take a step back to popularize science and gain a mass base, while also improving to provide advanced scientific guidance for the defense industry and general heavy industry, so that the Chinese industrial revolution has its own new life. I am only a layman in theoretical science, but I am willing to be a national with scientific common sense and hope that physicists and other scientists will not hesitate to teach me. I make this request because I intend to reform science education in primary and secondary schools, but I suffer from insufficient knowledge. However, I have been engaged in education for 56 years, from the age of eighteen to seventy-four, and have some experience, especially rich experience in failure. If I can get the help of new knowledge, I am still willing to do my best in my old age!

    读“中国的物理学”
    徐特立
    “中国的物理学”读过一遍，由于缺乏应有的物理知识不敢有所可否。但直觉地感觉到自然科学在中国过去社会缺乏产业基础，以至实验的成绩停止在刊物上，得不到实业家的物质帮助和社会舆论的鼓舞，而较高深的学术论文赏鉴者却在国外。因此许多理论的科学著述只用英文出版或用中英文合璧出版。这里表现出中国今日以前的科学家陷于悲惨的命运，这种命运今日才开始扭转。自然，目前只是政治革命将完成而产业革命还待有系统的开始的时候，物理的理论家的高深著述只能随着产业革命而参加领导工作或助手工作，才有前途。
    在科学教育方面，物理和化学是一切自然科学的理论基础，而物理又是化学的理论基础。由于中国科学教育两极端化，普通教育十分落后，从研究院到中小学的教育简直有天壤之别，因此中国的科学家成为空中祖师，他在地球上的中国领土没有应有的地位。今日从地狱中解放出来的广大群众迫切需要科学知识，用以进行产业革命，需要普及也需要提高。已经提高到中外闻名者科学家最好的办法是：一面退后一步把科学大众化，使自己有群众基础；另一方面还要提高，使国防工业及一般的重工业得到先进的科学指导，使中国产业革命有自己的新生命。我对于理论科学只是外行，但我愿做一个有科学常识的国民，希望物理学家及其他科学家不吝教诲。我提出这一要求，还因为我企图改革中小学科学教育，苦于自己学识不够，但从事教育工作自十八岁至今七十四岁共五十六个年头，却有若干经验，尤其是丰富的失败经验。倘能得到新知识的帮助，我仍愿以衰老之年，尽最后的努力！
