    Qinhuangdao Power Plant
    Achievements in Conservation
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Qinhuangdao Power Plant, one of the power plants under the North China Electric Power Company, has achieved success in the conservation and increased production campaign from May 1st to July 1st, thanks to the workers' efforts to save fuel coal and machine oil. Before liberation, the semi-burned coal slag leaking from the furnace in the boiler room was all treated as waste. The use of machine oil was also very wasteful, averaging 1.5 gallons per day, and the monthly oil consumption was more than 45 gallons. After liberation, the workers did their best to save, saving an average of more than 20,000 catties of coal every day, and the amount of oil used was also reduced a lot. Since May 1st, the workers in the boiler room proposed a plan to burn coal slag again to save good coal. After many experiments, they increased the amount of coal slag mixed with good coal from 3 tons to 8 or 9 tons per day, without reducing the amount of electricity generated. In the past two months, a total of 510.50 tons of coal slag have been burned, saving more than 415,140 catties of good coal. The workers in the turbine room voluntarily set a plan to save machine oil, using an average of 1 gallon per day. The experimental results showed that an average of only 0.8 gallons of oil was used per day. In the past two months, a total of only 50 gallons of oil were used, saving 20 gallons of oil per month compared to the past.

    秦皇岛发电所
    节约有成绩
    【本报讯】华北电业公司发电厂之一的秦皇岛发电所，在“五一”到“七一”两个月的节约增产运动中，工人们努力节省燃煤与机器油，已获得成绩。解放前，锅炉房炉子里漏下来的半燃化煤渣，全部做为废料。使用机器油也很浪费，平均每日消耗一加仑半，每月用油量都在四十五加仑以上。解放后，工友们尽力节省，平均每天可节省下两万多斤煤，用油量也减少多了。自“五一”开始，锅炉房的工人提出再烧煤渣以节省好煤的计划，试验多次后，从开始每日在好煤里掺烧三吨煤渣增加到八、九吨，而发电量并未因此减少。两个月来共烧了煤渣五一○·五○吨，节省了好煤四十一万五千一百四十多斤。汽机室的工人自动订出节省机器油每日平均使用一加仑的计划，试验结果，每日平均仅用油○·八加仑，两个月内总共才用了五十加仑的油，每月比过去节省油二十加仑。
