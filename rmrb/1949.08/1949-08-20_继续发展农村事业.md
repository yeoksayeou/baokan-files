　　Continue to Develop Rural Enterprises
　　Jian Wei
　　At present, rural side occupations in Hebei Province experienced a period of recession after the liberation of major cities such as Beijing and Tianjin. A small portion of handicrafts that had ceased operations or were in a state of semi-shutdown have not yet been turned around and restored to normal. The main reasons are: First, after the liberation of major cities such as Beijing and Tianjin, machine-made industrial products were sold in large quantities. Some local leaders experienced ideological wavering and blindly believed that handicrafts had no future. As a result, they relaxed their leadership and support, causing some rural side occupations to suffer setbacks, especially the local cloth industries in Yutian, Gaoyang, and Dingxian. According to statistics from the Woluogu District of Yutian in June, the number of looms has decreased from 2,092 last year to 1,061 now. The number of weavers has decreased from 2,831 to 854. The amount of cloth sold at each market has decreased from 56,000 bolts to 5,000 bolts, and the amount of local yarn sold has also decreased sharply from 5,000 jin to 200 jin. Moreover, the quality of cloth and yarn has also decreased significantly. Currently, only the production leadership department in Gaoyang has begun to recognize this and has made practical corrections; however, Yutian, Dingxian, and other places have not yet changed. Second, individual and scattered small handicrafts are difficult to cooperate and help each other. Production is often affected by difficulties in raw materials, funds, tools, and sales channels. Coupled with fluctuating prices and insufficient quality and technological improvements, they appear somewhat sluggish. For example, the raw materials for bamboo products in Linqing Town are frequently interrupted in supply, and the lack of funds and slow turnover have caused more than 80 bamboo product workers to become unemployed, and many bamboo product workshops are in a state of semi-shutdown. Similar examples include the iron stove industry in the town, the fishing industry in Baiyangdian in Anxin, and the weaving and mat industries. Third, some industries have been replaced by urban machine industries and have ceased operations, such as the saltpeter and salt industries in Daming and Ningnan counties, as well as the tobacco, indigo, hand-woven towels, and coarse socks in the riverside areas. All of these have ceased operations on their own or are in a state of semi-shutdown with only sales and no production due to poor sales channels.
　　Rural side occupations are indispensable important factors for future development of industrial and agricultural production and engagement in economic construction. Taking cities as an example, many industries rely on them to supply raw materials and semi-manufactured products, such as pig bristles, fur, eggs, and cattail bags; in rural areas, they rely on them to develop agriculture, such as oil extraction, flour milling, sheep herding, and pig raising. The vast number of farmers in disaster-stricken areas rely on this even more for their livelihoods. The Hebei Plain has vast and rich material sources and possesses solid objective conditions for developing rural side occupations. Therefore, in order to continue to restore the prosperity of side occupations and overcome existing difficulties, the following opinions are put forward: First, new guidelines should be quickly determined based on different situations. First of all, leaders must carefully analyze and study new economic trends and avoid blindness and hesitation in new situations. For example, although the cloth industries in Woluogu District of Yutian and Gaoyang and Dingxian have been occupied by foreign cloth and yarn from major cities such as Beijing and Tianjin, foreign cloth and yarn cannot currently meet the needs of the vast rural areas. In addition, limited by farmers' living habits and purchasing power, local cloth still has a certain market and considerable development prospects. For example, the striped cloth in Woluogu District is still praised and welcomed by farmers in Northeast China and outside the Great Wall, and more than 2,000 bolts are still sold at each market. The Tiger Brand cloth in the Zhuanlu (village) area of ​​Dingxian sells more than 12,000 bolts at each market. Appropriate support and assistance should be provided for this, and tools should be gradually improved, technology should be improved, costs should be reduced, high-quality products should be refined, and workers should be organized to use new machines in a planned way to gradually develop handicrafts into machine industries. Some handicrafts that cannot be replaced by machine industries for the time being, such as the bamboo industry and iron industry in Linqing, the fishing industry in Baiyangdian, and the weaving, straw braid, fur, pig bristles, animal husbandry, and mat industries scattered throughout the country, should be determined to adopt various methods to vigorously support and help. In addition to public loans, the most important method is to organize supply and marketing cooperatives for various industries to quickly and widely solve the current difficulties in funds, raw materials, tools, and sales channels in order to seek rapid recovery and development. Second, strengthen leadership so that some handicraft workers who cannot develop can gradually transfer to other industries from developing production. At present, due to insufficient leadership in the transfer work, tens of thousands of saltpeter workers in places such as Daming and Ningnan, and workers weaving towels from dozens of villages in Shaogu area of ​​Weixian have been idle after stopping work, which is a huge waste of labor and is extremely detrimental to the development of production. Therefore, it is urgent to strengthen leadership in the transfer work, combine the new economic trends with local production conditions, and organize idle labor and tools into agricultural production or other handicraft and side-occupation production. Here, we must focus on developing production, combine it with their personal interests, overcome the views of despising agricultural production, coveting great profits, and unwillingness to do hard work, and gradually guide handicrafts and side occupations to other production, and quickly reverse the current state of stagnation and disconnection.

　　继续发展农村事业
    建伟
    目前河北省的农村副业，自平、津等大城市解放后，曾一度表现萧条，有一少部分已停业或陷于半停业状态的手工业，至今仍未扭转和恢复常态，其主要原因是：一、当平、津等大城市解放后，机器工业产品大量出销，有些地方领导思想发生动摇，盲目地认为手工业没前途了，因而放松对其领导与扶持，致使某些农村副业虽于开展。尤以玉田、高阳、定县土布业较为显著、据玉田窝洛沽区六月份统计，织布机由去年二○九二架，到现在已减至一○六一架，纺织者由二八三一人减至八五四人，每集布匹上市由五万六千匹布减至五千匹，土纱上市亦由五千斤锐减至二百斤。且布、纱质量亦有显著降低。现在仅有高阳生产领导部门开始认识了这点，并作出切实纠正；但玉田、定县等至今仍未转变。二、个体分散的小手工业难于协作互助，常因原料、资金、工具、销路等困难影响生产，加以物价动荡与质量、技术改进不够，因而表现有些萧条，如临清镇竹货原料，因供给时常间断，资金缺少，周转不灵，使八十余个竹货工人歇业，很多竹货作坊陷于半停业状态。类似此例者还有该镇的铁炉业、安新白洋淀渔业，及编织、席业等。三、为城市机器工业所代替而停业的，如大名、宁南县的硝、盐业及沿河地区的烟草、土靛和手织毛巾、粗线袜等手工业。均因销路不畅，而自行停业或处于光销不产的半停业状态。
    农村副业为今后发展工农业生产、从事经济建设所不可缺少的重要因素之一。拿城市来说，有很多工业赖以供给原料及半制造品，如猪鬃、皮毛、鸡蛋、蒲包等；在乡村则赖以发展农业，如榨油、磨粉、牧羊、养猪等。遭灾地区广大农民则更要依此为生。河北平原上有广袤、丰富的物质源泉，具备发展农村副业的雄厚的客观条件。因此，为继续恢复副业的繁荣，克服已存的困难，特提出以下意见：一、根据不同情况，迅速决定新的方针。首先在领导上就须慎重分析、研究新的经济趋势，避免在新情况下的盲目与犹豫的偏向。如玉田窝洛沽区和高阳、定县的布业，虽为平、津等大城市洋布洋纱占领了一部分市场，但洋布、洋纱目前仍不能供应广大农村需要。加上农民为生活习惯与购买力所限，目前土布仍有一定的市场，且有相当发展前途。如窝洛沽区的条布至今仍受东北、口外农民的赞誉和欢迎，每集仍销二千余匹。定县砖路（村）一带的虎标布，每集更销达万二千匹。对此，就须作适当的扶持帮助，从中逐步改良工具，改进技术，降低成本，精制良品，并有计划的组织工人采用新式机器，逐渐将手工业发展到机器工业上去。还有些手工业暂时还不可能为机器工业所代替的，如临清的竹业、铁业，白洋淀渔业及散布各地的编织、草帽辫、皮毛、猪鬃、牧畜、席业等，就应决定采用种种方法大力扶持与帮助，除公家贷款外，最重要的方法是组织各业供销社，迅速广泛的解决目前存在的资金、原料、工具、销路等困难，以求迅速恢复并发展起来。二、加强领导，使某些不能发展的手工业工人从发展生产中逐步转业。目前，由于对转业工作领导不够，致使各地如大名、宁南就有盈万硝民，威县邵固一带有几十个村的织毛巾工人停止作业后，而大部闲散了起来，这是个巨大的劳力浪费，对发展生产极端不利，因此，急须加强对转业工作的领导，根据新的经济趋势结合当地生产条件，组织闲剩劳力、工具到农业生产或其他手工副业生产中去。在这里须要从发展生产着眼，结合其切身利害，克服轻视农业生产，贪图大利、不愿作苦工的观点，逐步引导手工副业走向其他生产上去，迅速扭转目前停滞与脱节状态。
