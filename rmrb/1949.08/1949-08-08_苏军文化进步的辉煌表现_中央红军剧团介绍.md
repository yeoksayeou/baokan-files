    The Splendid Manifestation of Cultural Progress in the Soviet Army
    Introduction to the Central Red Army Theater

    Moscow Dispatch: “The Soviet Army is not only armed with Stalin's victorious military science and excellent material equipment, but it is also the most progressive cultural army.” This was pointed out by Bakhmov in an article published in "Culture and Life." He said: "The Soviet Army has its own art studios, choirs, dance troupes, and theaters. The Soviet Army is an important school for educating the people."

    Bakhmov specifically introduced the Central Red Army Theater in the article, saying: The Central Red Army Theater is a brilliant manifestation of the cultural progress of the Soviet Army. It was established twenty years ago in the fighting atmosphere during the period when imperialism was provoking attacks on the Soviet Far Eastern frontier. Before the war, the theater staged dramas by Soviet writers about the civil war, army building, and our military history. The theater has performed in almost all military regions and visited many cities in the Soviet Union. During the Great Patriotic War, the plays performed by the theater expressed the theme of Soviet patriotism with new strength. It staged plays with great educational significance by Soviet writers such as Berwincev, Kornechuk, Leonov, and others. During the war, the theater's actors and actresses performed on the front lines and held more than 2,500 concerts. The close connection with the Soviet officers and soldiers greatly helped the theater to stage the play "The People of Stalingrad" (a patriotic play about the great victory of the Volga). The theater also achieved success in staging Berwincev's play "Meeting Point in the South," which describes the defeat of a large number of German fascist troops and the liberation of Crimea. After the war, the theater staged Chiprin's play "The Last Front Line," which tells the story of the end of the Patriotic War. The theater also staged "On Another Front Line," which describes the Soviet army scouts fighting behind the Japanese Kwantung Army. The theater also staged "Behind the Scenes of the Second Battlefield" to expose the instigators of a new war. This play was written by Soviet military officer Sobko. It faithfully and convincingly illustrates how, when the Second World War was in progress, British and American monopoly capitalists tried to compromise with their German counterparts, and how American industrialists and businessmen tried to conquer the people of Europe at all costs. The performance of these plays has played a great educational role for Soviet officers and soldiers.

    苏军文化进步的辉煌表现
    中央红军剧团介绍
    莫斯科讯：“苏联军队，不仅为斯大林胜利的军事科学和优良的物质装备所武装着，它同时也是一支最进步的文化大军。”这是巴霍莫夫在文化与生活报发表的文章中指出的。他说：“苏军有它自己的艺术室、歌咏队、舞蹈队和剧团，苏军是教育人民的重要的学校。”
    巴霍莫夫在该文专门介绍中央红军剧团的情况称：中央红军剧团是苏军文化进步的辉煌表现。它是二十年前在帝国主义对苏联远东边疆进行挑衅攻击时期的战斗气氛中建立的。战前，这一剧团上演了苏联剧作家关于内战、建军和我国军事历史的戏剧。该剧团几乎曾在一切军区演过剧，访问了苏联的许多城市。在伟大的爱国战争期间，该剧团所演的剧，以新的力量表现了苏维埃爱国主义的主题。它上演了伯尔文切夫、高涅楚克、里昂诺夫及其他苏联剧作家有巨大教育意义的剧本。战争期间，该剧团的男女演员们在前线演剧并举行二千五百多次音乐会。与苏军官兵的密切联系，对该剧团上演“斯大林格勒的人民”（叙述伏尔加伟大胜利的爱国剧）一剧的帮助很大。该剧团上演伯尔文切夫所写的描写大股德国法西斯军败北及克里米亚解放的剧本“南方的会合点”，也获得了成功，战后，该剧团上演了契普林的剧本“最后的战线”，该剧的故事是发生在爱国战争结束的时候。该剧团也上演过描写苏军侦察兵在日本关东军后方作战的“在另一条战线上”。该剧团并上演“第二战场内幕”，来揭露新战争的挑拨者。这个剧本是苏军军官索布科编写的，它忠实而令人信服地说明：当二次大战正进行时，英美垄断资本家怎样力图与他们的德国同类谋反妥协，说明美国工商业家怎样不惜一切代价力图征服欧洲各族人民。这些剧本的演出，对苏军官兵都起了极大的教育作用。
