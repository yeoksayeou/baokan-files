    Resolutely Suppress Bandits
    Changjiang Daily Editorial
    The Changjiang Daily, the organ of the CCP Central China Bureau, published the resolution on bandit suppression from the Henan Provincial Party Congress on July 27th, and issued an editorial entitled "Resolutely Suppress Bandits," calling on Party, government, army, and people in various parts of Central China to resolutely eliminate bandits. The editorial stated in brief:

    The Second Party Congress of the Henan Provincial Committee discussed the issue of bandit suppression in Henan Province and clearly stipulated that the complete suppression of bandits should be the central task of the entire Henan Party for a certain period in the future. We believe that this meeting was very successful, and the tasks put forward, the experiences summarized, and the future methods are basically correct and consistent with the spirit of the Central China Bureau's guidelines.

    The situation in most rural areas of Central China is basically the same as that in Henan, that is: they have not undergone thorough reform, or have not been reformed at all, and are still controlled by counter-revolutionary forces dominated by feudal landlords combined with bandits and secret agents. These counter-revolutionary forces will inevitably stubbornly obstruct our revolutionary work and carry out various forms of struggle against us. At present, the most prominent and concentrated form of struggle is the bandits taking up arms, suppressing the peasants, and opposing us. Therefore, bandits are one of the most hated and ferocious enemies of the masses, and bandit suppression has become the most urgent demand of the broad masses. To truly occupy the rural front, mobilize the masses, and meet the demands of the broad masses, we must first defeat the armed resistance of the counter-revolutionary forces and resolutely suppress the bandits.

    The bandits in various rural areas now, especially the major bandit gangs, are basically dispatched, organized, and led by the Kuomintang reactionaries in a planned way. This is the main pillar and representative of the remnant forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the countryside. After we eliminate the enemy's main force on the front lines, we must also thoroughly suppress the bandits in the countryside and in the rear, and the historical task of the domestic revolutionary war can be finally completed, and we will then be able to carry out other work.

    Suppressing bandits is an arduous struggle, and leading organs at all levels must seriously attach importance to and grasp the leadership of this work. We must make the greatest determination to transfer all possible cadres, equip them with necessary weapons, and closely cooperate with specialized bandit suppression troops to carry out bandit suppression, anti-hegemony, and peasant mobilization work.

    The clearing of bandits must be resolute and thorough. The troops responsible for bandit suppression and the local work cadres accompanying the army must be fully mobilized. The enthusiasm of the entire army must be fully mobilized. In order to find, capture, and eliminate bandits, we must not be afraid of any hardships and difficulties. We must be prepared to climb mountains and wade through rivers, walk on bad roads, walk on dark roads, and walk long roads; we must be prepared to eat poorly, sleep poorly, and live poorly; we must persevere under extremely harsh climates and difficult conditions, and must not have any slackness or wavering. We must give full play to our initiative and actively seek out bandits to fight everywhere. We must adopt long-distance raids, surprise attacks, fierce attacks and relentless pursuits, track and pursue them relentlessly regardless of area, and not give the bandits any respite, striving to eliminate them all. The standard for evaluating the success of bandit suppression is not to defeat, disperse, or drive away the bandits, not to eliminate a part or most of them, nor to create a superficial situation of peace and tranquility; but to completely eradicate them, to wipe out the bandits in one fell swoop, to capture the bandit leaders, to confiscate all the guns, and to eliminate future troubles forever; to dig out scattered bandits and hidden bandits at the root, to eliminate all hidden guns, and to ensure that there are no bandits or guns left.

    Different types of bandits should be dealt with separately according to the circumstances. The principle is that the ringleaders must be punished, those who were coerced will not be held accountable, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded. The habitual bandits who have committed heinous crimes against the people must be severely punished. Those who have committed minor offenses and are willing to repent, and who are not pursued by the people, should be allowed to atone for their sins. Those who were deceived into bandit dens in the past and are now aware and return, or who report bandit information and thus contribute to the victory of bandit suppression, should be given rewards according to the size of their contributions. This policy should be widely publicized among all classes, and should also be widely publicized to the bandits in conjunction with political offensives. In the struggle to suppress bandits, we must combine military suppression, political offensives, and mass mobilization.

    There are difficulties in suppressing bandits, such as the fact that the countryside has not undergone reform, and the bandits still have their social basis; some major bandit gangs have a long history of activity and have accumulated considerable experience in military activity, especially the peasants have not been mobilized and are afraid of bandits, so we lack strong reliance and informers, etc. However, these difficulties can be completely overcome as long as we recognize them and take appropriate measures. However, if we are only satisfied with the general situation of national victory, only satisfied with the occupation of cities, and thus become paralyzed, and do not make the determination to use a large part of our strength to go to the countryside to suppress bandits, oppose hegemony, and mobilize the peasants, and do not carry out serious and resolute suppression, then the bandits will never perish on their own.

    Whether bandits can be suppressed depends on whether we have made up our minds. The strength of our political, military, and economic power is by no means comparable to that of the bandits. With such a powerful force to suppress bandits, the bandits will never be able to resist. As long as we clarify our thinking, make up our minds to suppress the bandits, correctly implement the policies, and add a set of appropriate methods to mobilize the broad masses of peasants, we will surely be able to eliminate the bandits.

### 坚决剿灭土匪  长江日报社论

    坚决剿灭土匪
    长江日报社论
    中共中央华中局机关报长江日报，于七月二十七日登载河南省党代表大会剿匪工作决议，并以“坚决剿灭土匪”为题，发表社论，号召华中各地党政军民坚决肃清土匪。该社论略称：
    这次河南省委召开的第二次党代表会议，讨论了河南全省的剿匪问题，明确规定今后一定时期内以彻底剿匪为河南全党的中心任务。这次会议，我们认为开得很好，提出的任务，总结的经验，今后的办法，基本上都是正确的，与华中局的方针精神是一致的。
    华中绝大部分乡村的情况，与河南有基本相同之处，即：都没有经过彻底改革，或者还根本没有改革，现在还是掌握在以封建地主为主结合土匪特务等反革命势力的手里。这些反革命势力必然要顽强阻挠我们的革命工作，同我们进行各种各样的斗争。目前最突出最集中的斗争方式，就是土匪拿起武器，镇压农民，反对我们。因此，土匪是群众最痛恨的凶恶敌人之一，剿匪成为广大群众目前最迫切的要求。我们要确实占领农村阵地，发动群众，满足广大群众的要求，必须首先打垮反革命势力的武装抵抗，坚决剿灭土匪。
    现在各地乡村的土匪，特别是股匪，基本上是国民党反动派有计划的派遣、组织和领导的。这是国民党反动派残余势力在农村的主要支柱和代表。我们在前线消灭敌人的主力之后，还必须在乡村在后方彻底剿灭土匪，国内革命战争的历史任务才能最后完成，我们也才有可能进行其他的工作。
    剿灭土匪是一个艰苦的斗争，各级领导机关必须认真重视和抓紧领导这个工作。要下最大的决心抽调一切可能抽调的尽可能多的干部，配备必要的武装，与专门剿匪的部队密切配合，进行剿匪反霸和发动农民的工作。
    清剿土匪一定要坚决，要彻底。担任剿匪的部队和随军行动的地方工作干部，都须进行最充分的动员。全军上下的劲头，都要鼓得十足。为了寻找、捕捉、消灭土匪，不怕任何艰苦困难。要准备爬山＠水，走坏路，走黑路，走长路；要准备吃不好，睡不好，住不好；在极其恶劣的气候和困难条件下，都必须坚持下去，决不能有任何懈怠动摇。要发挥高度的积极性，到处主动寻找土匪作战。要采取长距离的奔袭奇袭，猛打猛追，不分区域的跟踪穷追，不使土匪有喘息机会，务求尽歼而后已。剿灭土匪成绩考核的标准，不是打垮打散打跑，不是消灭一部或大部，也不是打出表面平静无事的局面；而是要彻底根绝，对土匪要一网打尽，捉住匪首，缴完枪支，永绝后患；对散匪潜匪要连根挖出，起尽暗枪，做到匪枪全无。
    对各种不同的土匪，应根据情况，加以分别地处理。原则是首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖。残害人民罪大恶极的惯匪首要，一定要严惩。作恶不大不多的胁从分子，本人愿意自新，人民不追究者，应允其悔过自赎。过去被骗陷入匪窟，现在觉悟来归或报告匪情因而对剿匪胜利有贡献者，应视其贡献大小，给以罚当奖励。这种政策应在各阶层中广泛宣传，也应结合政治攻势向土匪广泛宣传。我们在剿匪斗争中，必须使军事清剿，政治攻势，发动群众三者结合起来。
    剿灭土匪是有困难存在的，如乡村没有经过改革，土匪还有它的社会基础；有些股匪有长期活动的历史，积累有相当丰富的军事活动经验，特别是农民没有发动，害怕土匪，因此我们缺乏有力的依靠和耳目等。不过，这些困难，只要我们认识之后，采取适当的办法，是可以完全克服的。但是，如果我们只满足于全国胜利的总形势，只满足城市的占领，因而麻痹起来，不下定用一大部分力量下乡剿匪反霸和发动农民的决心，不认真坚决地清剿，那么，土匪也决不会自行灭亡。
    土匪能不能剿灭，决定于我们有没有下定决心。我们政治、军事、经济力量的强大程度，决不是土匪所能比拟的，用我们这样强大力量去剿匪，土匪是决不能坚持抵抗的。只要我们思想弄明确，下定剿匪的决心，正确执行政策，再加上一套适当的办法，把广大农民群众发动起来，我们就一定能够消灭土匪。
