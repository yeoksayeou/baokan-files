　　Grain from Other Regions Transported to Tianjin and Sold Uniformly to the Grain Company; Goods Purchased in Exchange Handled by the Trust Company

    [Tianjin News] Recently, most agencies transporting grain to Tianjin for sale have been handling sales matters at the municipal Grain Company in accordance with the regulations of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce. According to statistics, the Jinnan Cooperative transported 20,000 jin of sesame (with another 20,000 jin of wheat stored in the cooperative warehouse in the city), the Heilongjiang Provincial Government of Northeast China transported 150 tons of small red beans, the Jilu Yu Industrial Company transported 120,000 jin of wheat, the Baodi County Production Promotion Society transported 30,000 jin of wheat, the Linqing Production and Marketing Cooperative of the Jinnan District transported 200,000 jin of wheat, and the Yuanchao County Cooperative General Society of the Jinnan District transported more than 20,000 jin of wheat (the society also plans to transport 5 million jin to Tianjin successively). In addition, there is the Third District Cooperative of Qiqihar City in Northeast China. The grain transported to Tianjin by this cooperative was originally sold privately on the market, but on the 13th, it was also handed over to the Grain Company. The Grain Company either purchases the grain from each unit itself or sells it on the market on behalf of the units, and tries its best to take care of the interests of the sellers in terms of pricing. At the same time, it also provides convenience in terms of grain storage. Units that sell grain and wish to exchange it for goods are all handled by the Trust Company.
