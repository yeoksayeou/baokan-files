　　At the meeting on the 15th, discussions continued on the report by the Chinese representative, Yang Jigao.

　　Brova, a school teacher from Stalingrad, spoke on behalf of the Soviet delegation, saying: The people of Stalingrad and all of the Soviet Union are today working with all their might to ensure that our children have all the conditions for learning and a happy life.

　　I, a Soviet teacher and mother, want to tell all the warmongers from this podium: You are not allowed to interfere with our peaceful labor and the happy lives of our children! Punish those warmongers so that they cannot realize their conspiracies. We will fight together with the working class and all progressive forces for peace and the security of all nations. I urge our meeting to endorse the work of the World Peace Congress, and that our department of education workers should actively participate with teacher groups in all countries, in cities, villages, enterprises, schools, and educational institutions, in establishing permanent peace committees and their regular work.

The Soviet delegation proposed that the resolution of the meeting should include the following requirements: Provide all children, regardless of gender, race, nationality, and the material status of their parents, with universal, free basic education in the local language; separation of school and church; a resolute struggle against the ideas of militarism and racial hatred, and against corporal punishment of students; and a struggle to dissolve and ban fascist children's and youth organizations.
