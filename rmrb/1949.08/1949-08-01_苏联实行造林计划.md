The great work of Stalin's plan to transform nature has begun in the steppe and forest-steppe regions of the European part of the Soviet Union since the early spring of this year. According to the plan, 120 million hectares will be afforested within fifteen years—equal to the total territory of the six countries of England, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark. 10 to 15 percent of farmland shelterbelts will be planted with fruit trees, which means an increase of 700,000 hectares of orchards. A total of 44,000 ponds and reservoirs will appear in vast areas. As of May 10, the spring afforestation plan has exceeded 37.1 percent. In Ukraine alone, more than 100,000 hectares have been afforested. In order to implement Stalin's plan to transform nature, the Soviet government, in addition to utilizing the strength of collective farms, state farms, and machine and tractor stations, is also establishing 570 afforestation stations, 114 of which have already begun work this spring.
