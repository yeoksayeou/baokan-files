　　Sixty Emergency Rescue Teams Organized in the Suburbs of Beijing
  　Strengthen Flood Prevention Inspection of Dangerous Works
    [This Municipality News] Flood prevention work in the suburbs of Beijing has been largely completed. Since the establishment of the Beijing Flood Prevention Headquarters on July 5th, emergency rescue teams have been organized on both sides of the Yongding River, a defense patrol system has been established, and a work plan has been formulated to begin repairing dangerous works. In Fengtai, Changxindian, Shijingshan and other areas, 61 emergency rescue brigades have been formed in villages within fifteen li along the river, and 16 river soldiers have been dispatched to cooperate with the village militias or members of farmers' associations to patrol the dikes, inspect the embankments, grasp the changes in water conditions, and prevent sabotage by special agents.
    In addition, the Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently instructed villages along the river to strengthen flood prevention work. If emergency rescue teams have not yet been organized, they should be organized quickly. Those that have already been organized should be inspected, and education should be carried out among the team members and the masses to raise their awareness and vigilance. Secondly, the dangerous works that have been completed should be carefully inspected, and if there are any unstable areas, they should be repaired again immediately.

　　平郊组六十个抢险队
  　加强防汛检查险工
    【本市讯】平郊防汛工作已大体完成。北平市防汛指挥部自七月五日成立以后，即在永定河两侧组织抢险队，建立防守巡逻制度，并拟定工作计划，着手修险。在丰台、长辛店、石景山等地区，沿河十五里以内各村，已组成抢险大队六十一个，并派有河兵十六人，协同各村民兵或农会会员，沿堤巡逻，检查堤防，掌握水情变化，及防止特务分子破环。
    又：中共北平市委郊区工作委员会日前指示沿河各村，加强防汛工作，如尚未组织抢险队者应赶快组织，已经组织者要加以检查，并在队员群众中展开教育，以提高其觉悟与警惕。其次对已完成之险工，应切实检查，如有不牢固之处，应即再加修筑。
