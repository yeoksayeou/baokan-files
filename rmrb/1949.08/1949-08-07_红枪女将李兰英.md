Li Lanying is a female hero from the Suzhong Liberated Area. Born into poverty, she lost her father at the age of seven. Her mother remarried, and she was often subjected to humiliation. Only when the New Fourth Army arrived did she turn over a new leaf and was elected as the village women's director and militia instructor. In July of the year before last, Jiangyan, a key town on the Haitian line in Suzhong, was occupied by the Chiang army, and Li Lanying's hometown became a major thoroughfare for the Chiang army traveling north and south. To protect the poor and ensure that women remained emancipated forever, Li Lanying joined the local armed work team. Because of her resourcefulness and courage, she quickly became a famous female hero in Haitian, and the masses gave her the nickname "Red Spear Woman General."

In November of the year before last, more than 300 Chiang soldiers in the Yunliang River of Jiangyan launched a dawn attack on Linhuang Township. When they were not far from Li Lanying, the Chiang soldiers shouted, "Don't move, don't move!" But she calmly raised her gun and, with a "bang," shot off a Chiang soldier's helmet. On another occasion, she led the armed work team in an ambush at Linjia Field. When twenty-one Chiang bandit "self-defense" members barged in, she shouted, "Charge!" The Chiang soldiers hurriedly set up a machine gun to fight back. Li Lanying raised her gun and shot down the enemy machine gunner. The "self-defense" team was stunned and fled in disarray. During the sixty days of anti-"encirclement and suppression," Li Lanying participated in a total of fifty-eight battles, killing five enemies. She seized a brand-new submachine gun from the Chiang army and armed herself.

A hero must be integrated with the masses. On one occasion, a company of "self-defense" troops attempted to attack Li Lanying and her armed work team. They had only traveled half a mile when the masses sent her sixteen pieces of intelligence within a quarter of an hour. When the enemy pounced, the armed work team members had already vanished without a trace. On another occasion, more than 300 Chiang soldiers had her surrounded on three sides, and she hid in a family's cabinet. When the enemy entered the village, all the villagers deliberately crowded outside the village to watch. The Chiang soldiers asked, "Where did the Red Spear Woman General go?" The villagers said, "She has slipped across the river and gone to the north." The Chiang soldiers hurried to pursue her north of the river.

The Chiang army in Jiangyan had no way to deal with this "Red Spear Woman General," and issued a notice: "Kill Li Lanying and be rewarded with 500,000 Legal Tender, double for capturing her alive." But to no avail. Later, the Chiang army spread rumors saying, "Li Lanying has been captured." When the masses heard the rumors, they rushed to the township government overnight to inquire. When they saw Li Lanying still bouncing around, they all rushed to hug her, overjoyed and speechless.

    红枪女将李兰英
    李兰英是苏中解放区一个女英雄，贫苦出身，七岁丧父，母亲带她重嫁，因此常受人家侮辱，新四军到了，她才翻了身，被选成乡妇女主任和民兵指导员。前年七月，苏中海泰线重镇姜堰被蒋军占领，李兰英的家乡就变成了蒋军南北往来的大道。为了保卫穷人和妇女永远翻身，李兰英便加入家乡的武工队，因为机智胆大，很快就成了名震海泰的女英雄，群众送她一个绰号叫“红枪女将”。
    前年十一月间，姜堰运粮河三百余蒋军，拂晓合击林黄乡，离李兰英不远时，蒋军大喊“不准动，不准动。”她却不慌不忙的举起枪，“砰”的一声，一个蒋军的钢盔被打了下来。又一次，她带武工队在林家野埋伏，当二十一个蒋匪“自卫队”员闯进来时，她大喊一声：“冲！”蒋军慌忙架起机枪应战。李兰英举枪射倒了敌人的机枪手。“自卫队”吓得目瞪口呆，连滚带爬跑走了。在反“清剿”六十天中，李兰英共参加战斗五十八次，毙敌五人。从蒋军手中缴来崭新的小马枪武装了自己。
    英雄必然是与群众相结合的，有一次，一个连的“自卫队”企图袭击李兰英和她的武工队，出动才半里路，群众在一刻钟内就送给她十六次情报。当敌人扑来时，武工队员们已经无影踪了。又有一次，三百多蒋军已经将她三面围住，她躲在一个人家的柜子里。当敌人进入该庄时，所有的群众都故意拥到庄外去张望。蒋军追问：“红枪女将那里去了？”群众说：“已经扑河溜到北面去了。”蒋军赶忙向河北追去。
    姜堰蒋军对这“红枪女将”毫无办法，出了张通告：“击毙李兰英赏法币五十万元，活捉加倍。”但毫无结果。以后蒋军便造谣说：“李兰英被捉住了。”群众听到谣言，连夜赶到乡政府去探问，一看李兰英仍蹦蹦跳跳，都一拥把她抱住，高兴得说不出话来。
