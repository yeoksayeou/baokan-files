    Municipal Trading Company Strongly Supports
    Weaving and Dyeing Industry Develops Rapidly
    Output Increases by Two-Thirds
    Suspended Factories Resume Production
    [This Newspaper] Following the principle of "Develop Production, Benefit Both Public and Private," the Beijing Trading Company has vigorously supported private weaving and dyeing industries through methods such as exchanging yarn for cloth, providing yarn loans, and processing dyeing, granting appropriate profits, and resolving the issues of raw materials and sales for various factories. The production of the supported weaving and dyeing factories has achieved significant development. The quantity of cloth woven and dyed by the factories has not only increased, but the quality has also been greatly improved.
    According to statistics: There are currently 370 weaving factories in Beijing (excluding small household weaving factories), with a total of 2,272 looms, including 301 power looms and 1,971 manual looms. Before being supported (before April of this year), only 949 looms were in operation, including 135 power looms and 814 manual looms, with a total monthly production of 28,631 bolts and a total of 1,978 workers. After four months of support from the Trading Company, the total number of looms in operation increased to 1,570, including 247 power looms and 1,323 manual looms. Monthly cloth production increased to 47,692 bolts, and the number of workers also increased to 3,136.
    The Trading Company began supporting various weaving and dyeing factories in April of this year. The number of factories requesting assistance has been increasing daily, reaching 406 to date (including small household weaving factories). In the four months of April, May, June, and July, the Trading Company exchanged a total of 58,027 blocks of yarn, receiving 82,536 bolts of various cloths in return, and loaned more than 370 blocks of cotton yarn to a small number of weaving factories that were unable to start operations. It also commissioned the Lifeng, Yanjing, Huaxing, Beiping and other dyeing factories to process and dye cloth, processing a total of 39,176 bolts of cloth in four months. This resolved the problems of lack of raw materials and difficult sales for weaving factories, as well as the problem of no work for various dyeing factories. The average output of the supported factories increased by 55 percent, and the number of looms in operation increased by an average of 60 percent. Many previously suspended factories, such as Fuchang, Xinji, and Huabei, have resumed production. Currently, Fuchang operates 11 looms and produces 275 bolts of cloth per month; Xinji Factory currently operates 7 looms and produces 245 bolts per month; and Huabei operates 12 looms and produces 334 bolts per month. Furthermore, Huaxing Weaving and Dyeing Factory previously operated 28 looms, but due to problems with raw materials and sales, its monthly output was only 450 bolts. After being supported by the Trading Company, it still operates the previous 28 looms, and its monthly cloth output has increased to 800 bolts. (Zhong)

    市贸易公司大力扶助
    织染业迅速发展
    产量增加三分之二
    停工工厂恢复生产
    【本报讯】在“发展生产，公私兼顾”方针下，北平贸易公司用以纱换布，贷纱，加工染色等方式大力扶助私营织染业，给以适当的利润，解决各厂原料和销路的问题，被扶植的各织染厂的生产都获得显著的发展。各厂织染出的布不仅数量增加，质也大大的改善了。
    据统计：北平现有的织布厂三百七十家（不包括家庭小织布厂），原共有织布机总数二、二七二台，计电力机三○一台，人力机一、九七一台，在被扶植前（本年四月前）开动着的机子仅九四九台，计电力机一三五台，人力机八一四台，每月生产总量为二八、六三一匹，工人总数为一、九七八人。经贸易公司扶植四个月后，开动的机子总数增至一、五七○台，计电力机二四七台，人力机一、三二三台，每月产布增至四七、六九二匹，工人也增至三、一三六人。
    贸易公司扶助各织染厂开始于今年四月，请求扶助的厂家日渐增多，迄今已达四○六家（包括家庭小织布厂），在四、五、六、七的四个月中，贸易公司共换出纱五八、○二七块，换回各种布八二、五三六匹，并对少数无力开工的织布厂贷给棉纱三百七十多块。又委托丽丰、燕京、华兴、北平等染厂加工染布，四个月间共加工染布三九、一七六匹。解决了织布厂缺乏原料、销路困难及各染厂无工可做的问题。被扶植的各厂产量平均增加百分之五十五，开动机子数平均增加百分之六十，以前很多停工的工厂如福昌、新记、华北等都恢复了生产，现福昌开动十一台机子，月产布二百七十五匹，新记工厂现开动机子七台，月产二四五匹，华北开动十二台机子，月产三三四匹。又如华兴织染厂以前开动二十八台机子，但因为原料销路都成问题，月产仅四五○匹，经贸易公司扶植后，仍然开动着以前的二十八台机子，月产布已增至八百匹。（仲）
