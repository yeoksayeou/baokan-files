Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 15th: The People's Liberation Army, pursuing the fleeing Ma clique bandit troops along the Xi'an-Lanzhou highway, under the slogan of "chasing the enemy wherever they flee," overcame extreme difficulties, fiercely pursuing them for nine consecutive days and nights, advancing over seven hundred li, leaving the enemy terrified and without any chance to catch their breath. On the road of pursuit, they sometimes encountered violent storms and sometimes traversed continuous towering mountains. When the army passed through the Linyou mountain area and the Shaanxi-Gansu border, there was a water shortage for two to three hundred li, and often there was not a single village for ten to twenty li. At the height of the sweltering summer heat, every soldier was drenched in sweat, and their mouths were parched with thirst. They often had to fetch water from several li away. Some soldiers fainted from heatstroke due to the heat and lack of water. But everyone remained energetic and bravely advanced. Those who fainted, after being treated, got up and rushed to catch up. In the small mountain villages, there was a lack of everything. The soldiers used horse troughs as washbasins, door panels as chopping boards, and iron shovels to bake pancakes. But when they heard that they had caught up with the enemy, the troops, not even caring about eating, rushed to attack the enemy. A certain unit once pursued the enemy for more than thirty li in two hours, continuously breaking through five lines of enemy defense. When a certain unit caught up with Xia Ma bandits near Guyuan, the soldiers had not eaten all day, but everyone cheered and shouted, "We've caught them!" They immediately launched an attack on the enemy. During the battle, a violent wind and hail storm suddenly broke out, and mountain torrents erupted. The artillery units unloaded the artillery from the mules and dragged the artillery through the mud, which was waist-deep, following the infantry forward. The soldiers who were assigned to attack advanced in the face of hail and the raging and roaring waist-deep mountain torrents; the mountains were steep and the slopes were slippery, so everyone dug pits with iron picks to climb upwards. After seven hours of hard fighting, they finally annihilated more than two thousand enemies.

　　我追歼马家逃匪
  　猛追九昼夜前进七百里
    【新华社西北前线十五日电】沿西兰公路穷追溃逃的马匪军的人民解放军，在“敌人逃到哪里就追到哪里”的口号下，克服了极端的困难，连续猛追九昼夜，前进七百余里，追得敌人丧魂失魄，毫无喘息的机会。在追击的路上，有时遇到狂风暴雨，有时翻越绵亘不断的崇山峻岭。大军经过麟游山区与陕甘边境时，二三百里内缺水，往往一二十里地没有一个村庄。时当炎热的伏天，每个战士都是汗流夹背，口干得冒火。他们常常要到数里以外去取水。有些战士因天热缺水而中暑昏倒。但每个人都依然精神奋发，猛勇前进。晕倒的经过救治后，就又爬起来赶上前去。在山沟小庄上，什么用具都缺乏。战士们就用马槽当做面盆，门板当案板，用铁锨烙饼。但当听说追上敌人的时候，部队就顾不上吃饭地争着去攻击敌人。某部曾经两个钟头追击敌人三十余里，连续冲垮敌人五道防线。某部在固原附近追上＠夏马匪时，战士们一天还没有吃饭，但大家都雀跃欢着呼：“这可抓住了！”他们立即向敌人发起攻击。战斗中，适逢风雹大作，山洪暴发，炮兵部队就把大炮从＠骡上卸下来，从深及腰部的泥水中牵引着大炮，随步兵前进。担任攻击的战士们，冒着冰雹和汹涌怒吼及腰的山洪前进；山陡坡滑，大家就用铁镐挖着坑往上爬。经过七小时的苦斗，他们终于歼灭了两千余敌人。
