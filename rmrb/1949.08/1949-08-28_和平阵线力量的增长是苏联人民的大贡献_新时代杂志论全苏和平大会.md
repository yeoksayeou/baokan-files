　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 27th, TASS Moscow dispatch: The latest issue of the New Era magazine, in its editorial on the All-Soviet Peace Conference that opened on the 25th, stated: The Moscow Peace Conference is of particular importance for the continued development of the peace movement and for the consolidation of the common front against the instigators of war. People of all nationalities and races, of different political and religious beliefs around the world, are watching the Soviet Union with hope. They know for sure that the Soviet people, who are concentrating on moving constructive efforts, are determined to defend peace. The Soviet people have not forgotten that the dark forces of imperialist reactionaries and obscurantists are preparing to plunge the world into a painful hell once again. A handful of industrial and financial tycoons in Wall Street and London, in order to achieve their selfish goals, and driven by the increasingly imminent economic crisis and fear of their own and colonial peoples, are wielding knives and swords, poisoning the international atmosphere. However, the war-mongers' sinister conspiracies are being met with the unremitting vigilance of the masses who refuse to serve as cannon fodder for the American oil magnates, copper magnates, and iron magnates.
　　The great strength of the peace and democracy camp, led by the Soviet Union, is blocking the path of the war-mongers. The Soviet people support peace, and they express goodwill and a desire for sincere international cooperation. However, they are not afraid of threats. Atomic bombs or any other kind of intimidation cannot scare them. The Soviet people are able to lead the world's progressive forces in an effective struggle for peace because they recognize their own strength and the invincible, inexhaustible power of the socialist society they have built.
　　New Era emphasized: With the establishment of the aggressive North Atlantic bloc, the struggle for peace has entered a new and more acute stage. Active peace advocates are looking for effective ways to deal with the war-mongers behind the North Atlantic Treaty.
　　The French Peace Brigade, mass meetings of British and Australian people friendly to the Soviet Union, the angry signature petitions of millions of Italians, and the Scandinavian Peace Week are all various forms taken by the people of the world in the strong movement to strive for peace, oppose war adventures, and oppose the heinous plans of American ambitious figures who vainly attempt to dominate the world.
　　New Era concluded: The peace front is growing in number and strength, mainly due to the Soviet state and the Soviet people. The All-Soviet Peace Conference will be a new and significant contribution of the Soviet people to the universal movement against war. Representatives from all walks of life, such as Soviet workers, peasants, and intellectuals, will once again declare and make the world hear: The Soviet people are vigilantly guarding peace, and they firmly believe that the peace camp has the power to avoid war.

　　和平阵线力量的增长是苏联人民的大贡献
    新时代杂志论全苏和平大会
    【新华社北平二十七日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：最近一期的新时代杂志，在社论中论及于二十五日开幕的全苏拥护和平大会称：莫斯科拥护和平大会对于和平运动的继续发展，对于反对战争挑拔者的共同战线的巩固，有着特别重要的意义。全世界各种不同民族和种族，不同政治和宗教信仰的人民，都满怀希望地注视着苏联。他们确实知道，全神贯注在动人的建设性努力中的苏联人民，正决心保卫和平。苏联人民并没有忘记：帝国主义反动派和愚昧主义者的黑暗势力，正准备再一次把世界投入痛苦的地狱。屈指可数的华尔街和伦敦城的工业与金融大亨们，为了达到其自私的目的，并为日益迫近的经济危机和对他们本国的与殖民地人民的恐惧所驱使，正在挥刀舞剑，毒害着国际空气。但是战争贩子们罪恶的阴谋，却遭到那些拒绝给美国石油大王、铜铁大王充当炮灰的群众的不懈的警觉。
    以苏联为首的和平与民主阵营的伟大力量，阻塞着战争贩子们的道路。苏联人民拥护和平，他们表示对忠诚的国际合作的善意和愿望。但是，他们不怕威胁。原子弹或其他任何种类的吓诈，都吓不倒他们。苏维埃人民所以能够领导世界进步力量为和平而进行有效的斗争，是因为他们认识了自己的力量，认识了他们所已建设的社会主义社会的无敌的、无穷尽的力量。
    新时代强调指出：随着侵略性的北大西洋集团的建立，争取和平的斗争，已进入了新的更加尖锐的阶段。积极的拥护和平的人们，正在寻找有效的方法，来对付北大西洋公约后面的那些战争贩子们。
    法国的和平大队，英国和澳大利亚的群众性的对苏友好的会议，意大利千百万人民愤怒的签名请愿，斯堪的纳维亚的和平周，所有这些，都是全世界人民在争取和平、反对战争冒险、反对妄图称霸世界的美国野心家的罪恶计划的坚强的运动中，所采取的各种各样的形式。
    新时代在结语中指出：和平阵线在数量和力量上都在增长，这主要归功于苏维埃国家与苏联人民。全苏拥护和平大会，将是苏联人民在反对战争的普遍运动中的新的重大贡献。苏联工人、农民和知识分子等各方面的代表们，将再一次声言，并使全世界都能听到：苏联人民正警醒地警卫着和平，而且他们坚信和平阵营有力量避免战争。
