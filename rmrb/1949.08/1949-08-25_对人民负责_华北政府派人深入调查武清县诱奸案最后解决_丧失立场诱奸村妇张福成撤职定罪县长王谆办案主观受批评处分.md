Being Responsible to the People
　　The North China Government Sends Personnel for In-Depth Investigation of the Indecent Assault Case in Wuqing County, Leading to Final Resolution
　　Zhang Fucheng, Removed from Post and Convicted for Losing His Standpoint and Indecently Assaulting Village Woman; County Magistrate Wang Zhun Criticized and Disciplined for Subjective Handling of the Case.

[Ping City News] Zhang Fucheng, director of the Production Promotion Society of Wuqing County, Hebei Province, was dispatched to Douzhang Village in the county on March 13 of this year to lead production and prepare for land reform. On March 25, Liu Shungui, the village head (the new regime in the village had not yet been formally established, and Liu was the village head elected by the old Baozhang), informed the village peasant association that four village women, including Nan Wang's wife, accused Zhang Fucheng of raping women. Liu also reported to the county and district cadres working in the village. The county and district cadres believed that the village was newly liberated, the situation was complicated, and Zhang Fucheng was politically firm and had never engaged in such behavior. They subjectively believed that the matter was purely a frame-up by landlords, so they reported it to the county government. On the 28th, they summoned the plaintiffs Nan Wang's wife, Zhang Qiang's wife, Liu Guangjiang's wife, and Tao Shifa's wife, as well as Du Guangxing, a former village office worker (who acted as a middleman in the affair), to the county and detained them all. The Wuqing County Court did not conduct a thorough investigation and study of the case, but subjectively affirmed that it was a false accusation by landlords. During the interrogation, Nan Wang's wife and Du Guangxing were shackled. Nan Wang's wife and other women were forced to admit that it was Du Guangxing's conspiracy and that Zhang Fucheng had not raped any women. On April 10, the county court released the four women and ordered them to return to the village and confess. During the detention of Nan Wang's wife and others, Liu Shungui filed a complaint with the North China People's Court, and the court replied that it would be investigated and dealt with later. However, Liu Shungui used this reply to spread rumors in the village, incite the masses, and fabricate a signed petition by the entire village to file another complaint with the North China People's Court. The Wuqing County Government considered his activities suspicious and detained Liu Shungui and Liu Wanjiang, the writer of the petition. Liu Shungui's wife, Liu Zhao's wife, went to the North China People's Court to verbally request that the defendant be summoned to investigate the facts. Based on this case, the North China People's Procuratorate sent personnel to Douzhang Village to conduct interviews with the plaintiffs and defendants separately to understand the situation. The investigation revealed the following facts: Liu Shungui and Du Guangxing were both personnel of the puppet Baojia office and had always colluded with landlords and rich peasants. Zhang Fucheng went to the village to mobilize the masses and struggle against the landlords, and Liu Shungui tried his best to protect the landlords, so he was sharply opposed to Zhang. On March 22, Du Guangxing lured Zhang Fucheng and Nan Wang's wife to the home of Xu Laohan, a foreign hired worker. Du drove away Xu and his son, and Zhang used the excuse of searching for guns and promised to give Nan Wang's wife a pass home, and then had sexual relations with Nan Wang's wife. In addition, he also attempted to indecently assault Zhang Qiang's wife in the village but failed. After Zhang Fucheng had sexual relations with Nan Wang's wife, Liu Shungui threatened Nan Wang's wife to admit the affair, which led to the lawsuit. The Wuqing County Court committed the error of subjectivism in handling this case and violated the policy of prohibiting torture to extract confessions. Zhang Fucheng, as a cadre, was ideologically corrupt, lost his standpoint, and indecently assaulted village women, causing a negative political impact on the masses. The North China People's Government has now decided: to remove Zhang Fucheng from his post and sentence him according to the crime of indecent assault. Yu Zhen, deputy chief of the Wuqing County Court, was given a warning for improper handling of the case. Wang Zhun, county magistrate of Wuqing County and chief of the court, was criticized for handling matters with subjective prejudice and lacking a serious and responsible spirit towards the people, and for failing to distinguish between right and wrong and promptly correct the situation. Liu Shungui, who shielded landlords and colluded with Du Guangxing in order to attack cadres, falsely invoked public opinion to file a petition, was sentenced to two months in prison and ordered to continue to reflect on his actions. Further investigation and handling of Du Guangxing and Liu Wanjiang will be conducted. In addition, the county will provide appropriate compensation to Nan Wang's wife to show the people's government's responsibility to the people and its commitment to seeking truth from facts.

  　华北政府派人深入调查武清县诱奸案最后解决
    丧失立场诱奸村妇张福成撤职定罪县长王谆办案主观受批评处分
    【平市讯】河北省武清县生产推进社主任张福成，于本年三月十三日被派到该县豆张庄领导生产，并进行准备土地改革工作。三月二十五日，该村村长刘顺贵（该村新政权尚未正式建立，刘系旧保长推选之村长），通知村农会，说村妇南王氏等四人控告张福成奸污妇女；刘并向在该村工作之县区干部报告。县、区干部认为该村系新解放，情况复杂，张福成政治坚定，素无此种行为，主观认为此事纯系地主陷害，乃报告县府，于二十八日传原告南王氏，张强妻，刘广江妻、陶士发妻，并与此案有关之旧村公所工役杜广兴（从中勾串者）到县一并扣押。武清县法庭对此案未加切实调查研究，主观肯定地认为是地主捣鬼诬告，审讯中曾对南王氏、杜广兴加带镣铐，南王氏等妇女被迫承认系杜广兴阴谋布置，张福成并无奸污妇女行为后，四月十日该县法庭当将四妇开释，令其回村坦白。在南王氏等被扣期间，刘顺贵即向华北人民法院控告，法院批复候调查处理。但刘顺贵即持此批在村胡造谣言，煽动群众，并捏造全村群众签名具状，再向华北人民法院控告，武清县政府以其活动可疑，即将刘顺贵及写状人刘万江扣押，刘顺贵之妻刘赵氏又至华北人民法院口诉，呈请拘传被告，究明事实。华北人民监察院据此案情，乃派员至豆张庄与原被告分别进行谈话了解，经查出该案实情如下：刘顺贵、杜广兴均系伪保公所人员，素与地主富农沆瀣一气，张福成至该村发动群众，斗争地主，刘顺贵极力袒护地主，遂与张尖锐对立。三月二十二日，杜广兴引诱张福成、南王氏至外籍雇工许老汉家中，杜将许氏父子赶走，张即以查索枪支为名，并允给南王氏回家路条，与南王氏成奸。此外并曾诱奸该村张强之妻未遂。张福成与南王氏发生奸情后，刘顺贵即威胁南王氏承认奸情遂至成诉。武清县法庭在处理此案时犯了主观主义的错误，并违反禁止刑讯的政策。张福成身为干部，思想腐化，丧失立场，诱奸村妇，对群众造成不良的政治影响。华北人民政府兹特决定：张福成撤职，并按诱奸罪处刑。武清县法庭副庭长于真对此案处理失当，予以警告处分。武清县县长兼法庭庭长王谆，以主观偏见办事，对人民缺乏严肃负责的精神，没有分清是非轻重，及时纠正，予以批评处分。刘顺贵袒护地主，为着打击干部，既与杜广兴勾结，又假借民意捏名上告，判处徒刑两个月，并责成其继续反省。至杜广兴、刘万江二人再作调查处理。并另由县给南王氏以适当抚慰，以示人民政府对人民负责，实事求是之意。（华北人民政府新闻发布室）
