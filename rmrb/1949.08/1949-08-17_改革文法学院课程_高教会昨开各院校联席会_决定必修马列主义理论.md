　　Reforming the Curriculum of Arts and Law Colleges
    Higher Education Commission Holds Joint Meeting of Various Institutions Yesterday
  　Decision Made to Require Marxist-Leninist Theory
    [By Our Newspaper] The North China Higher Education Commission held a joint meeting yesterday (16th) of the heads of universities, specialized schools, research institutions, and cultural relic institutions under its jurisdiction in Peiping and Tianjin. Those present included over forty individuals representing seventeen units, such as Peking University, Tsinghua University, Nankai University, Peiyang University, Normal University, Art College, Peking Research Institute, Palace Museum, and Peiping Library, including Tang Yongtong, Ye Qisun, Yang Shixian, Liu Xiying, Li Jinxi, Xu Bingchang, Ma Heng, and Wang Chongmin. First, Qian Junrui, Deputy Director of the Higher Education Commission, reported on the Commission's resolutions regarding the reform of compulsory public courses and the curricula of various departments in arts and law colleges in all specialized schools and above. The heads of various units enthusiastically exchanged opinions on issues such as the faculty for compulsory public courses and the order of teaching, the addition and subtraction of required courses in arts and law colleges, and the establishment of Russian courses in various schools. It was decided that the first semester would focus on "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism," and the second semester would continue with "On New Democracy." Regarding teaching, it was agreed that each school's administrative committee would organize professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants who teach politics, economics, law, history, philosophy, and other subjects and who have a research interest in Marxist-Leninist theory into three research groups: new philosophy, new democracy theory, and political economics. The Higher Education Commission would be responsible for convening regular symposiums for each group to draft teaching outlines, propose reference materials, study the core and key points of teaching, and exchange teaching experiences. The Higher Education Commission also hopes that students can organize themselves to learn together with professors to achieve the effect of "mutual assistance between teachers and students, and teaching each other." Next, Comrade Zhang Zonglin, Secretary-General of the Higher Education Commission, reported on the budget for the next year for various units under the Commission. Finally, the heads of various schools launched a discussion on the issue of streamlining and economizing, and passed a resolution on the establishment of a special committee composed of seven people, including Zhang Zonglin, Zeng Zhaolun, Fei Xiaotong, Fu Chengxun, Huang Yusheng, Li Linyu, and Zhang Quanxin, under the leadership of the Higher Education Commission, to study and promote the streamlining and economizing movement in various units.
