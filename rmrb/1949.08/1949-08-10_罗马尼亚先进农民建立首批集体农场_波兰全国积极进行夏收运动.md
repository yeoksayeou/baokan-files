    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th: TASS, Bucharest dispatch: Advanced farmers of the Romanian People's Republic have begun to establish the first collective farms in the republic. Poor and middle peasants from several villages have requested permission from the government and the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party to establish collective farms. Fifteen villages have now been approved to establish them.
    The first collective farms were established before the end of July. The first collective farms stipulate that only poor and middle peasants have the right to participate. According to the covenant, the distribution of income among the members of the collective farm will be calculated according to the number of labor day units of each member.
    The people in the areas where the first collective farms were established held enthusiastic celebrations, with delegations from the working people of many cities, representatives from machine and tractor stations, state-owned farms, and laboring peasants from nearby villages participating.
    The state gives these collective farms tremendous support. In addition to allocating large tracts of land for their long-term use, the state also provides the collective farm offices with housing, as well as warehouses, stables, and other buildings, and provides them with loans for capital investment. The farmers participating in the collective farms guarantee that they will work tirelessly to achieve great harvests.

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th: Polish Press Agency, Warsaw dispatch: The Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reform issued a communique on the 1st, stating that the summer harvest campaign is actively underway throughout Poland. Although unfavorable weather conditions after July 25 have caused some hindrance to the harvest, reports from various regions indicate that rapeseed and barley have been put into storage on time. In many provinces, rye has been completely harvested. Only in the northern regions, where grain matures later, is grain still awaiting harvest. Fifty percent of winter wheat has been harvested, and some has already been put into storage. Local authorities responded to the call of the Ministry of Agriculture and organized good assistance for the harvesting work, enabling the summer harvest to achieve results. Although unfavorable weather conditions have delayed the harvest, they have not caused any losses.

    罗马尼亚先进农民建立首批集体农场
    波兰全国积极进行夏收运动
    【新华社北平九日电】塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚人民共和国的先进农民，已开始在共和国建立第一批集体农场。若干村庄的贫农和中农，向政府和罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会请求准许设立集体农场。现已有十五个村庄获准建立。
    首批集体农场已于七月底以前设立。首批集体农场规定只有贫农与中农才有权参加。按照公约，集体农场各成员之间的收益分配，将按照每一成员劳动日单位的数目计算。
    建立首批集体农场地区的人民举行了热烈的庆祝，有许多城市的劳动人民代表团，机器和拖拉机站、国营农场和附近村庄的劳动农民代表团参加。
    国家给予这些集体农场以巨大的支持。除了拨交大块土地供它们长期使用之外，国家并给集体农场办事处以房屋以及仓库、厩舍等建筑物，并给予他们用作资产投资的贷款。参加集体农场的农民保证他们将不倦地工作以达到巨大的收获。
    【新华社北平九日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：农业与土地改革部一日发表公报称，夏收运动正在波兰全国各地积极进行。七月二十五日以后的不利气候条件，虽使收获遭到若干妨碍，但据各地报告，菜油子及大麦已按时入仓。许多省份里裸麦已收割完毕。仅在谷物成熟较迟的北部地区，谷物尚待收割。冬季小麦已收割了百分之五十，一部分业已入仓。各地方当局响应农业部号召，对收割工作组织了良好的帮助，使夏收取得了成绩。不利的气候条件虽然延迟了收获，但却并未造成任何损失。
