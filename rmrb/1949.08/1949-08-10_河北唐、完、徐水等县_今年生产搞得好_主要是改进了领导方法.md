    [Baoding News] The agricultural production in Tangxian, Wanxian, Mancheng, Xushui, Wangdu and other counties in Hebei Province has been quite good this year. This is the result of improving leadership methods and promoting farmers to carry out work such as accumulating fertilizer, collecting green manure, weeding cotton fields, reclaiming wasteland, planting trees, preventing floods and eliminating insects. The development of production work has also improved the leadership in rural areas and gained some new experiences: First, in the past, leadership of production and the work of various departments were not integrated with each having its own central task, which dispersed the strength. However, in promoting agricultural production this time, the leadership of production was closely integrated with the work of various departments. For example, the civil affairs department mainly completed the work of tilling land for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and of hygiene and epidemic prevention, ensuring the health of people and livestock, which also ensured the completion of production tasks. The public security department cracked down on feudal backward Taoist sects, strictly prohibited gambling and theft, and stabilized social order, so that farmers could produce with peace of mind. The Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation mobilized their members to actively participate in production. This has overcome the opposition between central work and departmental work. Second, in the past, at the district level leadership, the Party and government were not separated, and the district committee took charge of everything. Now, in general, there is a specific division of labor. When the district committee goes to the countryside, it must assign tasks to party members through the branch, and organize work groups in production to focus on consolidating the branch and strengthening the core leadership of the Party. Third, strengthen the leadership of new cadres, so that new and old cadres can combine with each other, work together, learn some experience, and then give them specific tasks to do in nearby villages, meet frequently, strengthen contacts, and discover and solve problems and difficulties in their work in a timely manner. Fourth, strengthen the predictability of production leadership. For example, Xushui had already publicized and prepared for spring production last winter, and completed the task of digging wells and installing waterwheels within half a year. While fighting drought, various counties have proposed flood and silt prevention. In order to prepare for autumn plowing, the grain loaned out last year has been recovered, and according to the situation this year, all of this loaned grain will be invested in lending out livestock.

    河北唐、完、徐水等县
    今年生产搞得好
    主要是改进了领导方法
    【保定讯】河北唐县、完县、满城、徐水、望都等县农业生产，今年搞得不错，这是改进领导方法，推动农民开展积肥、揽青、锄棉、开荒、造林、防洪、除虫等工作的结果。生产工作的发展同时改进了农村的领导，获得若干新的经验：第一，领导生产与各部门工作过去互不结合，各有中心，使力量分散，但在这次推动农业生产工作中，领导生产与各部门工作密切结合起来，如民政部门主要是完成烈军工属的代耕及卫生防疫工作，保证人畜的健康，也就保证完成了生产任务；公安部门则是取缔封建落后道门，严禁赌博偷盗，稳定社会秩序，使农民生产安心；青年团与妇联则发动了自己的团员、会员，积极参加生产。这样就克服了中心工作与部门工作的对立现象。二、过去在区级领导上，党政不分，区委包办，现在一般的做到具体分工，区委下乡定要通过支部给党员布置工作，并在生产中组织工作组，有重点的整理支部，加强党的核心领导。三、加强新干部的领导，新老干部互相结合，共同工作，学得点经验，再给他们具体任务，到附近村庄去做，勤碰头，加强联系，发现他们工作中的问题和困难，及时指导解决。四、加强生产领导的预见性，如徐水去冬即对春季生产提早宣传酝酿，半年内完成全年打井与安置水车的任务。各县在抗旱中就提出了防洪防淤；为准备秋耕，目前已将去年贷粮收回，根据今年情况，将此项贷粮全部投入到贷牲口上。
