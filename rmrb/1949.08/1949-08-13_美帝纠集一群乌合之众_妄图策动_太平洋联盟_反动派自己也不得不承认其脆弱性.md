Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 12th: U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are increasingly frequently conducting activities to form a "Pacific Alliance." Bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek, who flew from Taipei to South Korea on August 3rd, "lingered somewhere" en route and arrived at Chinhae Port in South Korea on the 6th, where he held two days of talks with South Korean puppet President Syngman Rhee. On the 8th, Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee issued a "joint communique" requesting Philippine President Quirino, who arrived in the U.S. on the same day, to take all necessary steps to promote the realization of the "Pacific Alliance." According to an Associated Press report on the 8th, MacArthur was extremely interested in this joint appeal by Chiang and Rhee. On the afternoon of the 8th, while Chiang Kai-shek flew back to Taipei from Chinhae, another Kuomintang bandit chieftain, Wu Tiecheng, hurriedly flew to Hong Kong, and on the 10th, he flew from Hong Kong to Taipei. After meeting with Chiang Kai-shek in Taipei, Wu will fly to Japan on the 12th to implore MacArthur to help recruit 100,000 Japanese soldiers to help the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang in their death throes.

The main activities for forming the "Pacific Alliance" are now being conducted in Washington. Philippine puppet President Quirino, at the call of Truman, flew to Washington on the 8th. On the 9th, he delivered a blatant anti-communist speech in the U.S. Senate, making himself an enemy of the people of the Far East, clamoring for "Southeast Asian and Pacific countries to form a Pacific Alliance, take unified action to fight against communism." In his speech, Quirino acted as a propagandist for Truman's plan to develop "backward areas." Quirino's anti-communist remarks won Truman's favor. On the evening of the 9th, Truman, attending Quirino's reception banquet, assured Quirino that his trip to the United States would not be in vain.

However, this so-called "Pacific Alliance" orchestrated by U.S. imperialism, which is resolutely opposed by the people of various Far Eastern countries, is admitted by the reactionaries themselves to be fragile. The Philippine Ambassador to the United States, Romulo, who is actively running around for this "alliance," openly admitted on the 7th that the reactionaries of Asian countries are a "disorganized mob."

    美帝纠集一群乌合之众
    妄图策动“太平洋联盟”
    反动派自己也不得不承认其脆弱性
    【新华社北平十二日电】美帝国主义及其走卒们正越来越频繁地进行筹组“太平洋联盟”的活动。八月三日飞离台北前往南朝鲜的匪首蒋介石，途中在“某地耽搁几天”之后，已于六日飞抵南朝鲜的镇海港，与南朝鲜傀儡总统李承晚进行两日会谈。八日蒋介石与李承晚发表了一个“联合公报”，请求于该日抵美的菲总统季里诺采取一切必要步骤，以促成“太平洋联盟”的实现。据美联社八日消息，麦克阿瑟对于蒋、李这一联合呼吁，极感兴趣。八日下午，与蒋介石自镇海飞返台北同时，国民党另一匪首吴铁城又匆匆地飞至香港，并于十日自港乘机飞往台北。吴匪在台北晤见蒋介石之后，将于十二日飞往日本，代表蒋介石叩求麦克阿瑟帮助招募十万日军帮助国民党残余匪帮作垂死挣扎。
    筹组“太平洋联盟”的主要活动，现正在华盛顿进行。菲傀儡总统季里诺，应杜鲁门之召，于八日飞抵华盛顿。他九日在美国参院发表了露骨的与远东各国人民为敌的反共演说，叫嚣“东南亚和太平洋国家合组一个太平洋联盟，统一行动，以与共产主义斗争”。季里诺在演说中为杜鲁门的开发“落后区”计划，充当吹鼓手。季里诺的反共言论，博得了杜鲁门的欢心。九日晚间，杜鲁门在出席季里诺的招待宴会上，即向季里诺保证说：季里诺来美决不会空手而回。
    但美帝国主义所策动的这个为远东各国人民坚决反对的所谓“太平洋联盟”，甚至连反动派自己亦不得不承认它的脆弱性。为这个“联盟”积极奔走的菲驻美大使罗慕洛，于七日即公开承认亚洲各国反动派是一群“乌合之众”。
