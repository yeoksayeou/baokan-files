　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 25th: Moscow dispatch: "Just as the lives of workers in capitalist countries are deteriorating daily, Soviet workers are moving into new homes." This was pointed out by Laiz, Deputy Minister of Construction of Heavy Industry Enterprises of the Soviet Union, in a report to the Second Plenary Session of the Central Council of All-Union Trade Unions. Laiz's report detailed the housing construction situation for heavy industry workers. He said: Simultaneously with the construction of new enterprises, housing is now being built on a large scale for heavy industry workers according to the Five-Year Plan. The housing to be built this year will be five times more than that built in 1940 before the war. Workers in the Kuznetsk Steel Trust, the "Red October" factory in Stalingrad, the Azov Steel Trust, and other enterprises have moved into new homes with modern equipment. New schools, clinics, kindergartens, and other facilities are also under construction for them. Laiz also pointed out that Soviet construction work is being widely mechanized. For example, new designed machines are used for work such as plastering. At present, the degree of mechanization of earthwork has reached 70 percent, and the degree of mechanization of mixing work has reached 52 percent.

　　苏联建筑房舍机械化工人们纷纷迁入新屋
    今年造屋将较战前多五倍
    【新华社北平二十五日电】莫斯科讯：“正当资本主义国家的工人生活日益恶化的时候，苏联的工人们却纷纷搬入新屋居住。”这是苏联重工业企业建设部副部长拉伊兹在全苏职工会中央理事会二次全会上作报告时指出的。拉氏的报告详述了为重工业工人建筑房屋的情况。他说：和建造新企业同时，现正按照五年计划大规模为重工业工人建造住屋。今年一年内将要建筑的住屋，将比战前一九四○年建筑的多五倍。如库兹涅茨科的钢铁托拉斯、斯大林格勒的“红十月”工厂、亚述的制钢托拉斯和其他企业的工人们，都已搬进了有现代化设备的新房屋。新的学校、诊疗所、幼稚园和其他设备，也正在为他们建筑中。拉伊兹并指出：苏联建筑工作正广泛机械化。如涂灰泥等工作，都有新设计的机器。现在，土工机械化的程度已达到百分之七十、拌和工作机械化的程度已达到百分之五十二。
