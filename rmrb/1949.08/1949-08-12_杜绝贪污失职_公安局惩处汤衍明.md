    Preventing Corruption and Dereliction of Duty
    Public Security Bureau Punishes Tang Yanming
    [Our Newspaper] Tang Yanming, an accountant at the Southern Suburbs Branch of the Public Security Bureau, has been retained since the takeover. Despite repeated education, admonition, and criticism from the branch, and participation in a training session, Tang has failed to correct the bad habits he developed while working in counter-revolutionary organizations. He has also committed serious acts of corruption, leading to his dismissal by order of the Public Security Bureau. Tang Yanming, a university graduate, has long been accustomed to extravagance, lying, squandering money, talking loosely about "freedom," and disregarding discipline. Although he made a formal self-criticism during post-liberation training for these poor habits, it was merely perfunctory and a display of petty cleverness, never a sincere transformation. He approached work passively and only acted when absolutely necessary or pushed it onto others. Each time he went out on official business, he would take the opportunity to waste considerable time. When handling salary distribution and grain purchases, he would never consult beforehand or report afterward, nor would he research methods. Furthermore, he violated regulations, once going to Tianjin for three days without leave and another time being absent from work for four days. When his superiors asked him to review his behavior afterward, he only wrote a superficial self-reflection. In particular, he committed serious acts of corruption in managing public funds: misappropriating over 16,000 yuan of public funds, including police salaries for March, and "borrowing" over 2,100 yuan from the public mess fund, which he only repaid when he was dismissed. On July 2nd, he received money for telephone bills to be paid to the telecommunications bureau, but underpaid by 20,800 yuan. During the handover process, he even attempted to lie and deny it. After these facts were discovered, the Public Security Bureau dismissed him. Tang then disappeared, refusing to hand over his responsibilities, attempting to evade accountability. The branch found him, detained him, ordered him to complete the procedures, and then released him. (Song Hua)

    杜绝贪污失职
    公安局惩处汤衍明
    【本报讯】公安局南郊分局会计员汤衍明，自接管后留用以来，经分局多方教育，历次规劝、批评，并曾参加受训一次，但汤仍不改正过去在反动机关中作事时的恶习，更犯有严重的贪污行为，经公安局通令革职。汤衍明曾在大学毕业，平日浮华成习，说谎话，乱花钱，乱讲“自由”，不守纪律，这些恶劣作风，在解放后受训时虽然作过形式的自我批评，但都是敷衍搪塞，玩弄小聪明，始终未认真改造。工作消极应付，对一切工作都是迫不得已时才去作或推诿给别人作。每次因公外出都要借机消磨相当时间；经办发薪和购售粮食等事都是事先不请示，事后不报告，也不研究办法，并且破坏制度，曾不请假赴天津三天，又一次旷职四天，事后上级要他检讨，只敷敷衍衍写了一个反省书。特别是在经营公款上犯了严重的贪污行为：挪用三月份员警薪饷等公款一万六千余元，又“借”用公家伙食金二千一百余元，直至革职后办理交代时才还清；七月二日领到应缴电信局的电话费，竟少缴两万零八百元，在办交代时还企图说谎抵赖。这些事实被发现后，公安局乃将其革职，汤又一去不返，拒不交代，企图逃避责任，经分局将其找回扣押，令其清理手续后释放。（宋华）
