    The working class must not be insulted! Weiss dismissed
    [Tangshan News] Weiss, the British director of the Linxi General Power Plant of the Kailuan Mining Bureau, adopted an imperialist attitude, making things difficult for and oppressing workers, and illegally resisting the mine's military representative from carrying out his work. Following the angry protests of all mine workers and people from all walks of life in Tangshan, Weiss has been dismissed and has apologized and admitted his mistakes.
    On July 30th, the Tangshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions submitted a letter of protest and a letter of request to the Tangshan Kailuan Mining Bureau. Workers from all mines and factories in Tangshan and people from all walks of life gathered to submit letters of protest and write letters of support. On the 4th, the Tangshan Kailuan Mining Bureau replied to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, saying: "We have warned Weiss about his inappropriate attitude and urged him to reflect. Weiss has now admitted that his attitude was inappropriate and is willing to apologize to your federation and all parties concerned. His position as director of the power plant has been submitted to our general bureau for approval and has been revoked. Another appropriate engineering personnel will be selected to take over..." On the 7th, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions sent representatives to the Linxi Mine to convey the measures taken by the Mining Bureau and to announce Weiss's letter of apology. The incident then came to a victorious end.
