Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 25th: The Shandong Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all regions of the province to do their best in the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting, and to complete the East China Bureau's 1949 agricultural production plan. The instruction pointed out that in the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, in accordance with the spirit of not violating the farming season, it is necessary to mobilize and organize the masses to harvest in a timely manner, plant wheat in a timely manner, and plow while harvesting, plowing early and deeply. The wheat planting task must be arranged according to the new situation of increasing the planting of industrial crops to support urban industrial construction. In areas where industrial raw materials such as cotton and peanuts are produced in large quantities, it should not be emphasized to plant more wheat, but should be promoted to increase the planting of industrial crops. In general areas, it should still be achieved that half of the plains are planted with wheat and one-third of the mountains are planted with wheat. In the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting, all rural cadres should be mobilized to wholeheartedly lead the farmers to overcome difficulties, explain to the farmers the various policies related to autumn production; pay attention to resolving land issues in the old and semi-old areas that must and can be resolved, and handle the issues of land rights and crop harvesting in the newly recovered areas; check the implementation of the policy of protecting draft animals, and resolutely implement the principle of voluntary and equal value exchange for the use of draft animals; organize transportation from places with more livestock in a planned way to overcome the difficulty of animal power in autumn production; implement the principle of rewarding labor models in production, educate and transform lazy people and loafers, and urge landlords and rich peasants who do not engage in labor production to engage in production. Party committees and people's governments at all levels must fully carry out the organizational work of autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting, and specifically solve the problems of labor shortage and draft animal shortage. First of all, it is necessary to mobilize all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers in rural areas, and widely mobilize women to participate in labor. In accordance with the principle of voluntary combination and mutual benefit, reorganize the original mutual aid organizations, and widely organize various forms of mutual aid organizations that are acceptable to the masses. Organize new supply and marketing cooperatives to solve the difficulties of supply and marketing for farmers, and work together to complete the tasks of autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting, while preparing to purchase industrial raw materials planted by farmers. The rear organs and troops stationed in rural areas should organize labor and animal power to help the local masses with autumn harvest and autumn plowing. At the same time, they should widely educate the masses to understand that cultivating land for revolutionary martyrs and their families is an obligation that every citizen should fulfill, so that the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting of revolutionary martyrs and their families can be effectively guaranteed. In the autumn planting, we should promote the improvement of agricultural production technology, mobilize the masses to cultivate deeply and carefully, use all means to accumulate more fertilizer, and promote field seed selection, seed exchange, seed soaking, and prevention of plant diseases and insect pests. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen social security work during autumn production, reorganize militia organizations, and local armed forces must protect the production of the masses, eliminate scattered bandits and secret agents, and resettle returning refugees in a planned and timely manner for employment and production.

    【新华社济南二十五日电】中共中央山东分局指示全省各地全力做好秋收秋耕秋种工作，完成华东局一九四九年农业生产计划。指示指出：在秋收和秋耕中，应根据不违农时的精神，动员、组织群众及时收割，及时种麦和边收边耕，早耕深耕。种麦任务必须根据增种工业作物以支援城市工业建设的新情况来布置，如棉花、花生等工业原料大量出产的地区，则不应强调多种麦子，而应宣传增种工业作物。在一般地区，则仍应做到平原地种麦二分之一，山地种麦三分之一。在秋收秋耕秋种中，应动员全体农村干部，全心全意领导农民克服困难，向农民说明有关秋季生产的各项政策；注意在老区半老区解决那些必须解决和可能解决的土地悬案，在新收复区处理地权和农作物的收割问题；应检查保护耕畜政策的执行，坚决贯彻自愿和等价交换的使用耕畜原则；应有计划地从牲畜多的地方组织贩运，克服秋季生产中的畜力困难；应贯彻生产中的奖励劳动模范的方针，教育和改造懒汉二流子，督促不事劳动生产的地主富农从事生产。各级党委及人民政府，必须全力进行秋收秋耕秋种的组织工作，具体解决劳动力和耕畜缺乏的问题。首先必须动员农村中全部全劳动力和半劳动力，并广泛动员妇女参加劳动。按照自愿结合与互助两利的互助原则，整理原有的互助组织，并广泛组织为群众乐于接受的各种形式的互助组织。组织新的供销合作社，解决农民供销困难，协同完成秋收秋耕秋种任务，同时准备收购农民种植的工业原料。驻在农村中的后方机关和部队，应组织劳力畜力帮助驻地群众秋收秋耕，同时要广泛地教育群众了解为烈军工属代耕是每个公民应尽的义务，使得烈军工属的秋收秋耕秋种得到切实保证。在秋种中应提倡改进农业生产技术，动员群众深耕细作，用一切办法多积肥，以及推广田间选种、换种、浸种，防止病虫害。此外，必须加强秋季生产中的社会治安工作，整理民兵组织，各地方武装必须为保护群众生产，肃清散匪特务，并有计划地、及时地安置回籍难民就业生产。
