The Growth of an Iron Stream
    Visiting a Certain Division Garrisoning Beiping
    By Our Correspondent Lin Yuan

    "We pledge to uphold a responsible spirit and a high degree of vigilance, to steadfastly guard our posts, to fulfill the glorious garrison mission, and to protect Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee in Beiping!"
    "Continue to promote the spirit of hard struggle, strictly abide by discipline, enforce policies and laws, diligently study, improve ourselves, and become a regularized and modernized national defense force."…

    This is a solemn oath, a code of conduct that the commanders and fighters of a certain garrison division in Beiping, in order to welcome the 22nd anniversary of "August 1st" Army Day and respond to the superior's call for regular army building, have formulated themselves after careful study and are now diligently following. From the division leaders to every soldier, all are solemnly and earnestly welcoming the "August 1st" review, welcoming the military flag and military emblem awarded to the division by the Chinese Revolutionary Military Commission. The entire division is filled with an atmosphere of excitement and joy.

    This is a young unit, only a little over three years since its formation, but it has already become a strong force. It undertakes the garrison mission in Beiping, successfully and happily, without committing the slightest offense, earning the support of the broad masses of citizens. The strong leadership of the Communist Party, the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant military line, the powerful support of the people, and the army-building experience of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and the New Fourth Army have enabled this unit, like its young brother units, to mature at an unexpectedly rapid pace. Its growth history is a typical example.

    It was formed from the local armed forces of the third and fourth sub-districts of Andong, consisting of a portion of workers from the Benxi coal mines and mostly local farmers. Shortly after its establishment, the Kuomintang reactionary army, with the help of American imperialism, launched an offensive against the people of Northeast China. In the autumn of 1946, the third and fourth sub-districts became enemy-held guerrilla areas. These two local armed forces, in order to protect the interests of the local people, like two sharp knives, inserted themselves into the enemy's heart, persisting in arduous guerrilla warfare in the areas near Shenyang, Fushun, Benxi, and Andong, defeating the enemy's countless sweeps, and standing tall. In May 1947, in coordination with the main force to launch the summer offensive, many emancipated peasants poured into the army, and this armed force became even stronger. In the summer of 1948, the two local armed forces were merged into the Independent Division of the Andong Military Region. When the last battle to liberate Northeast China was fought last winter, the division was ordered to go north to block the enemy's breakout from Changchun. Then it was ordered to advance into Shenyang, smashing all resistance along the way, and was the first to engage in the battle to attack the enemy's modernized fortifications on the Dongling positions on the outskirts of Shenyang, taking over a hundred enemy blockhouses in one night. In coordination with other brother units, it finally liberated the largest city in Northeast China. From April to November of last year, the division fought dozens of battles of various sizes, annihilating more than 3,000 bandits, and produced 1,435 combat heroes, and 45 model squads, platoons, and companies with collective merit. The storms of history have tempered them into giants, and any reactionary force trembles in fear before them.

    After the liberation of Beiping, it was ordered to undertake the garrison mission. Before entering the city, the division conducted a relatively in-depth policy education for the commanders and fighters, creating a movement to consciously abide by and mutually supervise the implementation of policies and discipline among the masses. In the past few months, great achievements have been made. For example, when the Second Company of the Division Guard Battalion first entered the city, they had no houses to live in and slept in the open for one night. The ground was very damp, and there was dry grass next to them, but they didn't move it at all. They also carried water and swept the courtyard for the villagers every day, moving the citizens who said, "Your discipline is so good, this is the first time we've seen an army that is so good to the people!" The entire division created a total of 62 model squads, platoons, and companies with no violations, and 749 individuals who performed meritorious service. This group of people is a powerful backbone for promoting the army to move towards regularization.

    This is an extraordinary and dramatic change: from the tense front line to the rear, where peaceful construction is beginning, from combat missions to garrison missions, from the dispersed rural environment to densely populated big cities. The environment and tasks have changed, and all the work of the army must also be appropriately reformed. Otherwise, it will not only be difficult to complete the arduous garrison mission, but also the army will not be able to withstand the various temptations in the city and will be difficult to consolidate. For this reason, the division repeatedly conducted revolutionary future education and policy discipline education, and sternly and conscientiously criticized various bad tendencies, especially the narrow selfishness of the peasants and certain relatively strong guerrilla habits, such as being unwilling to abide by discipline and regulations. Since the liberation of Shenyang, the composition of the army has increased with a part of liberated soldiers. In order to reverse the various erroneous ideas they had developed in the Kuomintang reactionary army, they were given special lectures on the history of the Communist Party, so that they could understand that the Communist Party is the party representing the interests of the working people. They were also enlightened on their class consciousness through grievance sessions. Especially after all the party members in the company branch were made public, party building was carried out on the basis of ideological party building, using self-reporting, public discussion, and mass recommendation of party members, and then individual admissions to the party through proper organizational procedures. The awareness of many liberated soldiers was raised. Some have been admitted to the party, and some are determined to perform meritorious service to strive for party membership, eliminating some of the initial gaps between the party and the masses, between the liberated soldiers and the old soldiers, and further strengthening the unity of the army.

    Recently, in order to respond to the call of the Military Commission and the North China Military Region for regular army building, the division proposed to launch a "two comparisons and one look" movement: "Compare determination, compare regularization, and see who progresses faster." A certain regiment stationed in Xicheng, based on the specific situation, required the soldiers to "regularize daily life, and combatize peacetime work." Each squad and platoon collectively formulated plans and launched challenges to each other, and a hard training movement for field movements has already begun. At the same time, the regiment demanded that cadres establish a democratic style of working from top to bottom and from bottom to top, opposed simple commandism, and emphasized the theoretical study of cadres to improve their work ability. The entire division emphasized systematic learning, starting from scratch, turning the army into a school, calling for the cultivation and creation of comprehensive model companies, and preparing to hold a comprehensive competition sports meeting around the October Revolution Day.

    一支铁流的成长
    访问卫戍北平的某师
    本报记者  林远
    “誓以负责的精神，和高度的警惕性，严守岗位，完成光荣的卫戍任务，保卫毛主席，保卫党中央所在地的北平。”
    “继续发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，严守纪律，执行政策法令，努力学习，提高自己，成为正规化近代化的国防军。”……
    这是一个庄严的誓词，是北平某卫戍师指战员为迎接“八一”二十二周年，响应上级正规建军号召，经过慎重研究，自己制订并正在遵奉厉行的守则。从师首长到每个战士，都严肃认真的迎接“八一”检阅，迎接中国革命军事委员会授予该师的军旗军徽，全师充满了兴奋欢欣的气氛。
    这是一个年青的部队，建军才三年多，但是，已经成为一个坚强的部队了。担任北平的卫戍任务，胜任愉快，秋毫无犯，博到广大市民的拥戴。共产党的坚强领导，毛主席英明的军事路线的指导，人民的有力支援，工农红军和八路军新四军的建军经验，使这个部队和年青的兄弟部队一样，以出人意料的速度成熟起来，它底成长史正是一个典型的例子。
    它是由安东三、四两个分区的地方武装组成的，成份包括了一部分本溪煤矿的工人，大部分是当地农民。成立不久，国民党反动军队在美帝国主义帮助下，向东北人民进攻了。一九四六年秋，三、四分区变为敌后游击区，这两支地方武装，为保卫当地人民的利益，象两把尖刀，插入敌人心脏，在沈阳、抚顺、本溪及安东附近地区，坚持了艰苦的游击战争，打垮敌人无数次的扫荡，自己巍然屹立。一九四七年五月，配合主力发动夏季攻势，许多翻身农民涌入部队，这支武装更壮大了。一九四八年夏，两支地方武装合编成安东军区独立师。当去冬解放东北最后一战时，该师奉命北上，阻击长春敌人突围，旋又奉命进军沈阳，粉碎沿途一切阻抗，最先投入进攻沈阳外围敌现代化工事东陵阵地的战斗，一夜拿下敌碉群百余座，配合其他兄弟部队，最后解放了东北的最大都市。从去年四月到十一月，该师曾进行了大小战斗数十次，歼匪三千余人，涌现出战斗功臣一千四百三十五名，集体立功的模范班、排、连共有四十五个单位。历史的暴风雨把他们锤炼成巨人，任何反动的力量在它面前都恐惶发抖了。
    北平解放后，奉命担当卫戍任务，入城之前，该师对指战员曾进行比较深入的政策教育，造成自觉遵守和群众性地互相监督相结合的执行政策纪律运动，几个月来，获得很大成绩。如师警卫营二连刚进城时，没房子住，露天睡了一夜，地很潮湿，旁边放着干草，他们一点也没动，每天还给老乡挑水扫院子，感动的市民说：“你们纪律真好，咱头一回看见对老百姓这样好的军队！”全师共创造出秋毫无犯立功的班、排、连共六十二个单位，个人立功的达七百四十九名。这批人正是推动部队向正规化迈进的有力骨干。
    这是一个不同寻常的剧烈变化：由紧张的前线到开始和平建设的后方，由战斗任务变为卫戍任务，由分散的农村环境到人口集中的大都市，环境和任务变化了，部队底一切工作也要进行适当的改革，否则，不仅难于完成艰巨的卫戍任务，而且部队会经不起城市中各色各样的引诱，也难以巩固。为此，该师曾反复进行了革命前途教育、政策纪律教育，对各种不良倾向，特别是农民的狭隘自私性及某些比较浓厚的游击习气，不愤于遵守纪律制度等现象进行了严正认真的批判。自解放沈阳后，部队成份增添了一部解放战士，为了扭转他们在国民党反动军队中养成的各种错误思想，曾特别讲解共产党史，使了解共产党是代表劳动人民利益的党，并用诉苦方法，启发他们的阶级觉悟，特别在连队支部党员全部公开以后，在思想建党的基础上，进行组织建党，采用自报公议群众推荐党员，再经正当组织手续，个别吸收入党，许多解放战士觉悟提高了，有的已被吸收入党，有的下决心立功争取入党，消除了党与群众之间，初期解放战士与老战士之间的某些隔阂，进一步增强了部队团结。
    最近，该师为响应军委及华北军区正规建军号召，提出开展一个两比一看运动：“比决心，比正规，看谁进步快”。驻西城的某团根据具体情况，向战士要求“日常生活正规化，平时工作战斗化”，各班、排都集体的订立计划，相互掀起了挑战，对操场动作并已开始了苦练运动，同时该团对干部要求建立自上而下，自下而上的民主作风，反对单纯的命令主义，并强调干部的理论学习，提高工作能力。全师都强调有系统的学习，从头学起，把部队改变成一所学校，号召培养和创造全面模范连队，并准备在十月革命节前后，举行一个全面竞赛运动大会。
