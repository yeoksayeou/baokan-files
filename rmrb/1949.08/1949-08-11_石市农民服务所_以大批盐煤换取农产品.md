    Exchanges Large Quantities of Salt and Coal for Agricultural Products
    [This newspaper, Shijiazhuang] With the assistance of state-owned enterprises, the Farmer Service Center and Cooperative Goods Station (formerly known as the Farmer Service General Station), affiliated with the Shijiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Society, exchanged miscellaneous grains, waterwheels, salt, coal, and other items for over 1.2 million jin of wheat from farmers and cooperatives in various regions after this season's wheat harvest. This has further improved urban-rural relations and strengthened the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. The Farmer Service Center has gained the widespread trust of farmers in the past six months of operation. After the wheat harvest, the service center, based on the needs of the farmers, obtained miscellaneous grains from the trade company, coal from the state-owned Zhengtai Coal and Iron Company, and salt from the state-owned salt company, and carried out large-scale exchanges with the farmers. As of the 27th of this month, a total of 600,000 jin of wheat had been exchanged for 400,000 jin of millet, 110,000 jin of sorghum, 140,000 jin of corn, 20,000 jin of black beans, 10,000 jin of soybeans, 24,000 jin of bran, 27,000 jin of salt, and more than 700 tons of coal. The exchange is still continuing and is expected to continue into the autumn harvest. The Cooperative Goods Station has also established business relationships with organized cooperatives and shops that purchase local products in various regions to carry out large-scale material exchanges. Since its establishment in May, the station has established contact with cooperatives in 28 counties and cities, and has established business relationships with the trade company, the Water Conservancy Promotion Society, the Zhengtai Coal and Iron Company, and some other public and private industrial and commercial entities in the city. The value of various goods brokered by the station is estimated at over 100 million RMB. The industrial products brokered include: more than 2,000 tons of coal, more than 400 bolts of foreign cloth, 25 packages of alkali, 13 barrels of kerosene, 20 cases of cigarettes, 18 scales, and various other items such as foreign cement, sulfuric blue, stinking alkali, and arsenic. The agricultural products brokered include: more than 400 bales of cotton, 20 barrels of white oil, 1,000 jin of locust seeds, and various other items such as homespun cloth and sacks. In addition, it hired 850 large carts and more than 10 trucks for various cooperatives and merchants from distant places to be responsible for transporting the traded materials. During the wheat harvest, a total of more than 600,000 jin of wheat was exchanged for various units. In order to welcome the autumn harvest of agricultural products, the Shijiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Society has begun to prepare for the establishment of another farmer service branch (there are already two branches), and to expand warehouses and adjust cadres.
