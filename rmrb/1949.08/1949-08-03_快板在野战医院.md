Quick Clapper in the Field Hospital
Third Field Army Cultural Work Troupe No. 2  Xie Renhong

A turtle butts its head against a stone, a hard collision; how could a turtle win? The 74th Division ran into the People's Liberation Army, and its 30,000 troops were wiped clean. The 74th Division was Chiang Kai-shek's Imperial Guard, the number one of the five main forces. Division Commander Zhang Lingfu lost his life on Menglianggu. The Menglianggu battle ended quickly, and the red report of victory flew over. The field hospital transit station is working day and night, busier than ever. As the sun sets and the stars fill the sky, stretchers are lined up. As the wounded are sent to the transit station, the service personnel register them in front of the stretchers. Our quick clapper continues from here.

"The service personnel are truly strong, rushing around as soon as the wounded arrive, notebooks in hand, registering line after line, first asking their names and hometowns, then asking which unit and what position the comrades hold, are they lightly or seriously wounded? The lightly wounded are sent to the dressing station, the seriously wounded are sent to the operating room."

One of the wounded was a squad leader, wounded in the arm. He didn't sleep on the stretcher but walked on his own, and we commend him:

"This comrade is truly good, knowing that there are few civilian laborers this time. Wounded in the arm, he doesn't sleep on the stretcher but runs on his own. This kind of spirit should be praised!"

Leaving the registration aside for now, we arrived at the operating room. The operating room is truly beautiful. A gasoline lamp hangs from the roof beam, and snow-white cloth surrounds the walls. The Second Section Chief has finished operating, and our quick clapper opens its voice.

"The Second Section Chief is capable in every way, operating and treating very carefully, holding the knife, holding the basin, first disinfecting, then giving an injection. The wounded comrade cries out in pain, a painkiller tablet, swallowed into the stomach."

After the wounded have been operated on, they go to the rest room to sleep. We also take a stroll to the rest room. The nurse is very tired, having not slept for three days and three nights. We will commend him:

"The nurse is busy day and night, taking care of the wounded very thoughtfully, helping the seriously wounded to cover themselves with quilts, helping the lightly wounded to put on clothes, holding a white flour bun in his left hand, and a spicy soup in his right hand, feeding water and feeding soup, swatting flies and making beds, having been busy for three nights without sleep, his spirit is even stronger than before."

The nurse has just been commended, and the rest room is filled with laughter. The lightly wounded get up to ask for food, and the seriously wounded raise their heads to ask for soup. Our quick clapper continues:

"Comrades, this is a transit station. The hospital equipment is very simple. All kinds of things are lacking, please bear with us. The enemy is focusing on attacking, concentrating a million troops. There are many people and horses in the Yimeng Mountains, eating up the grain and burning all the firewood. The enemy comes to loot everywhere, sweeping away pigs, chickens, cattle and sheep. There is nothing to buy in the mountains, and comrades have nothing good to taste. White flour buns and spicy soup are ordinary things, good for healing wounds."

Turning a corner, changing direction, we take a trip to the treatment room. The medical staff are busy changing dressings, and our quick clapper opens its voice again:

"The medical staff are truly strong, working day and night. The isolation gown is as white as frost, and the mask is worn on the ears. Holding tweezers and a basin, gauze and cotton are always with them, asking this seriously wounded person where it hurts? Asking that lightly wounded person where it is swollen? The wounded comrade cries out in pain, changing the dressing must be gentle, not heavy, gently, slowly, slowly, gently, taking care of the wounded very thoroughly, rendering meritorious service time and time again."

In the middle of the night, the moon is due south, and the wounded still have to be transferred to the rear. The associate administrator comes to mobilize, and we will use quick clapper to say the associate administrator's words:

"Comrades, I'm very sorry, this is not a rear hospital. There are many people and few houses in the mountains, and it is inconvenient for comrades to live. Tonight, we will still walk thirty li, comrades, we must help each other, the lightly wounded helping the seriously wounded, be careful and take care along the way. Comrades, remember, the wounded must also render meritorious service. If you do a good job of friendship and mutual assistance, it will be recorded in the merit book. Comrades, when you get to the rear, rest assured and recuperate well. I wish your wounds will heal soon, and you will return to the front with a happy spirit!"

The little rooster crows at four o'clock, the stretcher team is about to set off. The wounded are sleeping on the stretchers, the weather is cold and the clothes are thin, and they feel cold. The common people love the soldiers, taking off their worn cotton-padded coats, wrapping the wounded tightly. "You are fighting against old Chiang at the front, sacrificing blood for us, taking good care of our comrades, we are guaranteed to turn over." Everyone was moved when they saw this. The army and the people are truly one family. The material for the quick clapper has arrived again, and we immediately commend this spirit:

"This old man is truly good, taking off his big cotton-padded coat, taking care of the wounded very thoughtfully, afraid that our comrades will freeze. When our comrades' wounds are healed, they will go to the front again to render meritorious service, liberating all of China as soon as possible, and protecting the rivers and mountains of our workers and peasants. Please, elders and fellow villagers, be extra careful on the road, walk slowly up and down the slopes, the wounds of the comrades are most important. Don't give him cold water when he is thirsty, and take shelter when the plane comes. When you reach the destination, see which stretcher gets first place!"

    快板在野战医院
    第三野战军文工第二团  谢仁宏
    乌龟碰石头硬碰硬，乌龟那能碰得赢，七十四师碰到解放军，三万人马碰个干干净。七十四师是蒋介石的御林军，五大主力第一名，师长张灵甫，孟良崮上丧了命。孟良崮战斗结束快，鲜红的捷报飞过来，野战医院转运站，日夜工作忙不开。日落西山星满天，担架排成一条线，伤员送到转运站，服务员登记到担架前，我们的快板就往下编。
    “服务员，真正强，伤员一来就到处忙，笔记簿子拿手上，登记一行又一行，先问姓名和家乡，再问同志那一部分什么职务，轻伤是重伤？轻伤送到包扎所，重伤送到开刀房。”
    有一个伤员是班长，胳膊上负了伤，不睡担架自己走，我们将他来表扬：
    “这个同志真正好，知道这次民工少，胳膊上，负了伤，他不睡担架自己跑，这种精神应该叫个好！”
    且把登记丢一傍，我们到了开刀房，开刀房，真漂亮，汽油灯，挂屋梁，雪白的布，围满墙，二室长，开过刀，我们的快板开了腔。
    “二室长，样样能，开刀治疗很谨慎，拿着刀，捧着盆，先消毒，后打针，伤员同志叫声疼，止痛片，肚里吞”。
    伤员开过刀，休息室内去睡觉，我们就到休息室内走一遭，看护员，很疲劳，三天三夜没睡觉，我们就把他表一表：
    “看护员，日夜忙，照顾伤员很周详，帮助重伤盖上被，帮助轻伤穿衣裳，左手拿着白面馍，右手又捧辣胡汤，喂水又喂汤，又扑苍蝇又铺床，忙了三夜没睡觉，精神更比以前强。”
    看护员，刚表扬，休息室里笑嚷嚷，轻伤爬起来要饭吃，重伤抬头要喝汤，我们的快板又接上：
    “同志们，这里是转运站，医院设备很简单，各样东西都缺乏，照顾不到要包含，敌人重点来进攻，百万兵马都集中，沂蒙山区人马多，粮食吃尽柴烧空。敌人来了到处抢，猪鸡牛羊一扫光，山里没啥东西买，同志们没有好的尝。白面馍馍辣胡汤，东西平常好养伤”。
    转个弯，调个向，治疗室里走一趟，医务员，换药忙，我们的快板又开腔：
    “医务员，真正强，白天黑夜工作忙。隔离衣，白如霜，口罩戴在耳朵上。拿着镊子捧着盆，胶布棉花不离身，问这重伤你哪里痛？问那轻伤你哪里肿？伤员同志彩口痛，换药手轻不能重，轻轻的，慢慢的，慢慢的，轻轻的，照顾伤员多周到，一次一次立功劳。”
    半夜三更月正南，伤员还要往后方转，协理员，来动员，我们就把协理员的话儿用快板说一遍：
    “同志们，很抱歉，这里不是后方医院，山里人多房子少，同志们生活不方便。今晚还走三十里路，同志们大家要互助，轻彩号帮助重彩号，一路小心多照顾。同志们，要记牢，伤员也要立功劳，友爱互助做得好，功劳簿上记一条。同志们，到后方，好好安心好修养，祝你们伤口早日好，精神愉快回前方！”
    小小公鸡叫四更，担架队，要动身，伤员睡在担架上，天寒衣薄身体冷，老百姓爱护子弟兵，脱下身上的破棉袄，把伤员裹得紧又紧，“你们前方打老蒋，牺牲流血为咱们，把咱同志爱护好，咱们翻身有保证。”大家看了受感动，军民真是一家人，快板的材料又来到，当场表扬这种精神：
    “这位大爷真正好，脱下身上的大棉袄，照顾伤员真周到，怕咱同志冻坏了。等咱同志伤口好，重上前线立功劳，早早解放全中国，把咱工农的江山保。拜托父老众乡亲，路上千万加小心，上坡下沟慢慢走，同志们伤口最要紧。口渴不给他喝凉水，飞机来了要荫避，等到送到目的地，看那个担架得第一！”
