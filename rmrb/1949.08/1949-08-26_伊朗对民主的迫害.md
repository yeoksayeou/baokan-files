　　Iran's Persecution of Democracy
    By Bǐ Luòfū, translated by Chén Guāng

    Reports from Iran paint a picture of blatant persecution of democratic forces within the country. The constabulary and police, trained and led by American officials, have launched an attack on all progressive organizations that advocate national independence and oppose imperialist enslavement. The reactionaries' aim is directed at the People's Party and trade unions affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions.

    London and Washington have painstakingly crafted a plan to establish a military and police dictatorship in Iran. According to a statement by a group of Iranian parliamentarians, Nūruì·Āisīfándáruì, the former Iranian Foreign Minister, conducted negotiations with senior officials of the British Foreign Office in London four months ago, with the aim of further reducing the already diminished powers of the parliament and immediately changing the Iranian constitution. Tehran newspapers reported that this plan to change the Iranian constitution received full support from Washington, where it aroused great interest.

    Currently, no department of the Iranian central government, not even any second-tier government department or agency, is not directed by American advisors. American advisors, along with British agents who have long been active in Iran, interfere in Iran's political and economic life everywhere. As a result, Iran is rapidly becoming a colony and strategic springboard for Anglo-American imperialists.

    To this day, Iran has not completed any social reforms. The working people are subjected to the most brutal exploitation. The labor bill proposed by the People's Party representatives in the 1944 parliament has been shelved. Medieval feudal forces are the supreme rulers in the countryside. The vast majority of peasants do not own their own land and work for the landlords from morning till night. Even the best-off peasants receive only one-fifth of the harvest.

    The material situation of the working people is rapidly deteriorating. Prices have risen more than tenfold compared to before the Second World War and are continuing to rise. Due to tens of thousands of tons of grain being transported away by American and British advisors and smugglers for speculative purposes, Iran is experiencing a severe food shortage everywhere. Reports of civilian unrest due to hunger and excessively high prices have been received from Sèngmǔnán, Kǎrìwēn, Guānmǔ, Kèěrmǎnshā and other towns. The people's poverty is further aggravated by heavy taxes. It should be noted that thirty-seven percent of the national budget is used to maintain the army and purchase American arms.

    Iran is filled with inferior goods, all kinds of waste and old goods from American companies; and many of Iran's textile, leather and weaving enterprises, unable to withstand American competition, have either closed down completely or drastically reduced production, causing thousands of new industrial workers and handicraftsmen to be forced into the ranks of the unemployed.

    Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that the Iranian people's fear and dissatisfaction have obviously increased. The broad masses are more closely united around democratic organizations, especially the People's Party.

    The People's Party was organized by Iranian progressives in the autumn of 1941. Since then, it has become the main guiding force of the national democratic movement. The People's Party represents and defends the interests of the masses – workers, peasants, handicraftsmen and working intellectuals. It fights for democracy in political life and strives to guarantee the progressive development of the country and the improvement of the living conditions of the broad masses.

    The People's Party defends the independence of its nation and country, fights against the colonial-style enslavement of Iran, and demands that Iran's foreign policy should be a peaceful foreign policy. Because of the People's Party's clear stance, which conforms to the interests and aspirations of the Iranian people, it has gained great prestige and widespread support in the country. The Iranian people listen to its voice everywhere.

    This is why the Iranian reactionaries and their Anglo-American masters are so violently attacking the People's Party; they understand that there is a force in the People's Party that is preventing their evil conspiracies. According to Iranian newspapers, the British Ambassador in Tehran did indeed demand that the Iranian government completely destroy the People's Party and democratic trade unions. Similar demands were also insisted upon by representatives from Washington – that completely eliminating the People's Party was the main condition for Iran to receive any loans. Since the new wave of popular resistance against the so-called "Seven-Year Plan" for American colonization of Iran surged across the country at the end of that year, and because popular opposition caused the Iranian parliament to cancel concessions to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, the reactionaries have intensified their conspiracy against the People's Party.

    The enemies of the Iranian people began to seek an excuse to violently attack progressive organizations again. The Iranian Vazhīfū newspaper reported that as early as December 30, 1948, the military attempted to instigate riots and political assassinations to blame the People's Party and use this as a pretext to declare martial law in order to be able to ban the People's Party and arrest the party's leaders. This was well known to Tehran social figures.

    The course of events proceeded exactly like this. On February 4th, they orchestrated an attempt to assassinate the Shah. According to reports in the Kaihan and Ittela'at newspapers – both of which are related to the palace – the only document discovered regarding the assassination attempt was a card issued by the reactionary Balchí-E-Eslám newspaper, which is close to pro-British religious circles; however, the Sched government decided to use this assassination attempt as the long-awaited excuse to declare martial law in Tehran and other regions. At the same time, the Iranian government closed down the People's Party, and the constabulary occupied the People's Party's premises. Dozens of progressive newspapers were searched and destroyed, and many editorial offices and printing houses were sealed off. In Tehran alone, thousands of members of democratic groups were arrested. On the streets and in residential areas, troops and constabulary increased their patrols.

    In order to prove the legitimacy of the police's terroristic persecution of the People's Party and other democratic organizations, Interior Minister Eghbal publicly presented some hastily fabricated statements by the police department in parliament, aimed at proving that the adventurers who attempted to assassinate the Shah were members of the People's Party. In order to win the favor of his Anglo-American masters, Eghbal added such nonsense to the police department's fabrications, saying that the People's Party was supported by the "Soviets." This anti-Soviet provocation was clearly an attempt to harm Soviet-Iranian relations. Now there are rumors in Tehran that Eghbal and his subordinates are fabricating excuses to suppress the Iranian-Soviet Cultural Relations Association.

    After destroying democratic groups and establishing a military and police dictatorship throughout the country, the rulers of Iran quickly adopted the "Seven-Year Plan" made in Washington. The Iranian people firmly oppose this plan. The humiliating agreement with the British Imperial Bank has been extended, and the issue of canceling the unequal agreement with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company has also been removed from the parliamentary agenda.

    Recent developments prove that Iran is increasingly becoming a colony and tool of the Anglo-American bloc; imperialist plunderers are shamelessly violating Iran's independence and national sovereignty, and the rulers in Tehran are advancing along a path that is completely incompatible with the fundamental interests of their country. Fearing their own people, the Iranian rulers have resorted to police terror and the persecution of democrats. The reactionaries in Tehran and their foreign patrons are attempting to use this means to suppress the will of the Iranian people, who insist on sovereign independence and friendship and co-existence with other freedom-loving peoples.

### 伊朗对民主的迫害

　　伊朗对民主的迫害
    毕洛夫作  陈光译
    来自伊朗的报导描绘出一幅伊朗国内对民主势力明目张胆的迫害的图画。为美国官员训练并领导的宪兵和警察已经对所有主张民族独立与反对帝国主义奴役的进步组织发动了一个攻击。反动派的目的是指向反对人民党和加入世界职工联盟的职工会。
    伦敦和华盛顿辛苦地作出了一个为了在伊朗建立军事和警察独裁的计划。根据伊朗国会一群议员的声明，纽瑞·埃斯凡达瑞，前伊朗外长在四个月以前，在伦敦和英国外交部的高级官员进行了一个谈判，其目的是见于将进一步缩小已经缩小了的国会权力，而欲马上改变伊朗宪法。德黑兰报纸报导，此一改变伊朗宪法的计划，得到了华盛顿的全力支持，在华盛顿此一计划引起了非常热切的注意。
    目前，伊朗中央政府的任何一个部，甚至连第二级政府的任何部门或机构，没有不是由美国顾问所指挥的。美国顾问们和那些久已在伊朗活动的英国特务们一道，到处干涉着伊朗的政治和经济生活。结果伊朗很快地变为英美帝国主义者的殖民地和战略跳板。
    到今天，伊朗还没有完成任何社会改革。劳动人民被最残酷地剥削着。在一九四四年的议会中，人民党代表提出的劳工法案已被束之高阁。中世纪的封建势力在农村中是最高的统治者，绝大多数的农民没有自己的土地，而从早到晚地为地主作工，收入最好的农民亦不过得到收获物的五分之一而已。
    劳动人民的物质情况正在急速恶化。在第二次大战中物价较战前涨了十余倍，现在还在继续上涨。由于成万吨的谷物被美英的顾问和走私者为其投机目的而运走，使伊朗到处感受着尖锐的粮荒。从圣姆南、卡日温、关姆、克尔满沙和其他城镇，发出了由于饥饿和过高的物价而引起的平民骚动的报告；人民的贫困由于苛捐杂税而进一步加重了。在此应注意的是，百分之三十七的国家预算，是为了维持队军和购买美国的军火。
    伊朗充满了美国公司的下等货物，各种的废物和旧货；而伊朗很多的纺织、皮革和编织品的企业，因吃不消美国的竞争，不是全部关门，就是剧烈地减产，造成新的几千产业工人和手工业工人被迫走入了失业者的队伍。
    在这种情况下，伊朗人民的显然增加了恐惧和不满是一点不足为奇的。广大的群众更加紧密地团结在民主组织的周围，特别是人民党的周围。
    人民党是伊朗进步分子于一九四一年秋天组织的。从那时起它就成了民族民主运动的主要指导力量。人民党代表与维护群众——工人，农民、手工业工人和劳动知识分子——的利益，它为政治生活上的民主而战，为保证国家进步的发展与广大阶层生活条件的改善而奋斗。
    人民党保卫其国家民族的独立，为反对对伊朗殖民地式的奴役而斗争，并且要求伊朗的外交政策应该是和平的外交政策。由于人民党符合于伊朗人民的利益与愿望的显明立场，它在国内获得了巨大的威信和广泛的支持，伊朗人民到处谛听着它的呼声。
    这就是为什么伊朗的反动派及其英美主子们如此狂暴的攻击人民党的理由；他们明白在人民党中有一种力量在阻止他们的罪恶阴谋。据伊朗的报纸称：英国驻德黑兰大使，确实要求过伊朗政府全部摧毁人民党及民主的职工会。同类的要求也曾为华盛顿的代表所坚持——即完全消灭人民党是伊朗得到任何贷款的主要条件。自从那年年底人民反抗美国殖民地化伊朗的所谓“七年计划”的新浪潮汹涌全国，和由于人民的反对而使伊朗国会取消了对英伊石油公司的让步以后，反动派更加剧了反对人民党的阴谋。
    伊朗人民的敌人开始寻求再次狂暴进攻进步组织的借口。伊朗瓦日弗报报导说，早在一九四八年十二月三十日，军事方面企图挑拨骚动与政治暗杀，以嫁罪于人民党，并以此为宣布戒严令的借口，以便能够禁止人民党与逮捕该党领袖，这是德黑兰社会人士所周知的事。
    事情的进程恰恰如此。在二月四日，他们布置了谋刺伊王的企图。根据开汉报和以特拉特报——该两报均与宫庭有关——的报导，关于谋刺案唯一发现的文件，是与亲英的宗教界接近的反动的巴尔其以斯兰姆报所发出的一张卡片；然而施德政府决定利用此一谋刺企图，作为在德黑兰与其他区域宣布戒严令的期待已久的借口。与此同时，伊朗政府封闭了人民党，宪兵占领了人民党的房屋。数十个进步的报馆被搜查并捣毁了，很多编辑所和印刷所被查封了。在德黑兰一地，民主团体的数千会员被捕了。在马路上，在住宅区，军队和宪兵加了岗。
    为了证明警察对人民党和其他民主组织的恐怖迫害的合法，内务部长埃格帕尔在国会中公开了一些警务处匆忙捏造的声明，旨在证明企图刺杀伊王的冒险者是人民党的党员。为了博得其英美主子的欢心，埃格帕尔又给警务处的捏造加上了这样的无稽之谈，说人民党是由“苏联人”所支持的。这一反苏的挑拨很显然的是企图中伤苏伊的关系。现在德黑兰有埃格帕尔与其僚属们正在制造借口以镇压伊苏文化关系协会的传说。
    破坏了民主团体和在全国建立了军警独裁之后，伊朗的统治者迅速采用了华盛顿制作的“七年计划”。伊朗人民坚决地反对着这一计划。对英国帝国银行的屈辱协议是延长了，取消与英伊石油公司订立的不平等协定的问题，也在国会的议程中取消了。
    最近的发展证明，伊朗正日益加深地变成英美集团的殖民地与工具；帝国主义强盗者们，正在无耻地侵犯着伊朗的独立与国家主权，德黑兰的统治者正沿着与其国家基本利益毫不相容的道路前进。由于惧怕自己的人民，伊朗统治者竟诉诸于警察恐怖与对民主者的迫害。德黑兰的反动派与其外国赞助者，企图用这种手段来镇压坚持主权独立和坚持与其他爱好自由的人民友谊共存的伊朗人民的意志。
