Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: TASS, Pyongyang, 8th: Under the slogan of striving for the peaceful reunification of Korea, workers and peasants in South Korea are launching strikes and demonstrations. On July 20th, South Korean workers held a strike to support the decision of the Democratic Fatherland Front on striving for the peaceful reunification of Korea. The strike was led by workers in Seoul. According to the Korean Central News Agency, tens of thousands of leaflets were distributed in Seoul during the strike, calling on people from all walks of life in South Korea to support the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. Tram transportation and traffic on the three railways leading to Seoul were halted, and telephone and telegraph communications between Seoul and the provinces were also interrupted. The strike was held in all districts of Seoul. On the day of the general strike, the strike committee issued a letter to the people of South Korea, emphasizing that "Workers and the people of South Korea are jointly and resolutely protesting against the reactionary conspiracy of the Syngman Rhee group, which obeys the orders of US imperialism, and this reactionary group is preventing the peaceful reunification of the country." The letter to the people stated that South Korean workers must fight against all attempts to obstruct the reunification of the fatherland and universal suffrage. We demand that all American military institutions and the United Nations Commission on Korea, which helps the United States to divide Korea and turn Korea into an American colony, immediately withdraw from South Korea. We workers demand absolute freedom of activity for all democratic parties and people's organizations, as well as freedom of publication and speech. The call of the workers in Seoul was supported by workers all over South Korea. Farmers in the Ang-geum and A-nong (above place names are transliterations) areas of Gyeonggi Province held grand demonstrations under the slogans of "Long live the Democratic Fatherland United Front" and "Long live the peaceful reunification of Korea."

In Gyeongsang North and South Provinces, guerrillas attacked police stations 65 times between July 19th and 24th. More than 1,000 guerrillas participated in these battles.
