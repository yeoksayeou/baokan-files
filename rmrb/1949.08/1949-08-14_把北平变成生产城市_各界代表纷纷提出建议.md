    Transforming Beiping into a Production City
    Representatives from All Sectors Offer Suggestions
    [Reported by this newspaper] Representatives attending the Beiping Municipal People's Congress have unanimously expressed their enthusiastic support for the policy of transforming Beiping into a production city. The workers of Beiping are standing at the forefront of building Beiping with a high degree of awareness, undertaking the task of developing production. Sun Rong, an old worker who has worked at the Qinghe Woolen Mill for forty-one years, is fifty-nine years old this year. He is the chairman of the Qinghe Woolen Mill's trade union and was elected to attend the congress. He said repeatedly, "How could workers have participated in such a grand meeting in the past! After suffering oppression for forty years, today the workers have stood up. If we don't develop production well and bring out the strength of the workers, who would we be worthy of?" He hopes that in the future, workers' political and cultural education should be strengthened to raise workers' awareness and unleash their productive forces. Representatives of rickshaw workers, Li Jingxiang, and night soil workers, Wu Dekuan, both stated that rickshaw workers and night soil workers are willing to contribute their greatest strength to the construction of the new Beiping. Li Jingxiang said: "The more than 40,000 rickshaw workers in Beiping are all willing to quickly switch to the production front. Many of them are skilled workers."
    Representatives of private industrialists and businessmen in Beiping have great expectations for the development of private industry and commerce in Beiping. Sun Fuling, manager of the private Fuxing Flour Mill, said that to develop Beiping's industry, it is necessary to first develop basic industries, so that the majority of industries that manufacture consumer goods become industries that benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood; at the same time, gradually concentrate many small-scale factories to develop large-scale industries, which can save manpower and material resources and achieve greater results. Wang Xiangzhen, manager of Cixing Iron Factory, Beiping's largest private factory, said that Beiping has an industrial technical foundation, especially its special handicrafts are very developed. If various small-scale industries can be strengthened and led in an organized manner, this is also a force for increasing production. In addition, the planned establishment of various junior vocational schools of engineering to train industrial talents is also needed for the development of production. Pu Jiexu, manager of the private Zhenbei Leather Company, believes that production must be standardized in order to reduce the waste of manufactured products, and hopes to unify weights and measures, strengthen market regulation and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and send experts to the countryside to understand the situation. Liu Yifeng, a representative from the business community, provided two suggestions on how to transform Beiping from a consumer city into a production city. He suggested that factories in Shanghai be moved to Beiping; in addition, he hoped to dredge the Beiyun River. He said that if the Beiyun River can be dredged to transport materials and raw materials, not only can the eastern suburbs of Beiping become a prosperous industrial area, but also costs can be reduced. If further progress is made to connect it with the Yongding River, the southwest transportation of Ping City can also be developed, and floods can also be reduced.
    Economics professors Fan and Hong, representatives of primary and secondary school teacher associations and the Municipal Women's Federation, Tian Lun, student representative Duan Baolin, farmer representative Liu Tongen, etc., all believe that the convening of this congress will play an important role in the construction of Beiping. They have great confidence in Beiping's transformation from a consumer city into a production city.

    把北平变成生产城市
    各界代表纷纷提出建议
    【本报讯】参加北平市各界代表会议的代表，对于把北平市变为生产城市的方针，一致表示热忱的拥护。北平的工人们，都以高度的自觉站在建设北平的最前列，担任起发展生产的任务。在清河制呢厂做过四十一年工的老工人孙荣，今年五十九岁了，他是清河制呢厂的工会主任，这次被选来参加大会。他连声说：象参加这样的大会，过去那有咱工人的份！四十年来受尽了压迫，今天工人翻了身，要不好好发展生产，拿出工人的力量来，咱对得起谁。他希望今后要加强工人的政治文化教育，提高工人的自觉，发挥生产力量。三轮车工人代表李敬祥、粪业工人代表吴德宽，都表示三轮工人和粪业工人愿在建设新北平中尽最大力量，李敬祥说：北平的四万多三轮工人都愿意很快转到生产战线上来，他们中间许多是有技术的工人。
    北平私营工商业代表对北平私营工商业的发展寄予很大的期望。私营福兴面粉厂经理孙孚凌说，要发展北平的工业，一定要先发展基本工业，使大多数制造消耗品的工业变为有利国民生计的工业；同时逐步地使许多小规模的工厂集中起来，发展大工业，这样可以节省人力物力，收效也大。北平最大的一家私营工厂——慈型铁工厂的经理王向震说，北平是有工业技术基础的，尤其是特种手工业非常发达，如果能将各种小型的工业加强起来，有组织的领导他们，这也是增加生产的一种力量。此外如有计划的设立各种初级工科专门学校，培养工业人才，也是发展生产所需要的。私营振北制革公司经理浦洁修认为要能使生产品达到标准化，才能减少生产制成品的浪费，并希望统一度量衡，加强市场管制和城乡物资交流，派遣专家赴四乡了解情况。商界代表刘一峰对于如何使北平由一个消费的城市变为生产的城市提供了两点意见，他建议上海的工厂迁到北平来；另外，希望疏导北运河，他说如能疏导北运河，运输物资原料，不但北平东郊可变成工业繁盛区，而且可减低成本。若再进展与永定河贯通，则平市西南交通亦可发达，水患亦可减少。
    经济学教授樊、弘、中小学教联和市妇联代表田纶、学生代表段宝林、农民代表刘同恩等，都认为这次代表会的召开，将会对北平的建设事业起重要作用，他们对于北平由消费城市变成生产城市抱着极大的信心。
