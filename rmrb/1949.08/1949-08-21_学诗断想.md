Random Thoughts on Learning Poetry - One:
    Ji Chuyang
    The laboring people love poetry that either expresses themselves or fully expresses their own thoughts, feelings, life, and will. In any era, they have their own poetic creations; they have never abandoned poetry. Because, in the cultural and spiritual realm of the laboring people, poetry is a traditional and very important weapon of struggle!
    There is no need to go far back; just looking at some of the poetic creations of the laboring people collected in recent years is enough to powerfully illustrate this point. For example, during the rule of the war criminal Yan Xishan in the Jinzhong area, the following two folk songs against "soldier-peasant unity" were popular:
    "Soldier-peasant unity" is really good,
     It doesn't grow crops, only grass,
     Watching the land go to waste!
     "Soldier-peasant unity" is a treasure pot,
     Gathering and gathering until no one is left,
     Families broken, people dead, and the ghost blows out the lamp!
    Although these are just a few sentences, one opposing and one affirming, they are imbued with the laboring people's lived, class-based feelings; and they can indeed be used to expose the essence of the reactionary rule of the war criminal Yan Xishan. The laboring people, relying on them, dealt a powerful blow to the dark measures of the war criminal Yan Xishan. In the Jinzhong area, we could hear some anti-Yan folk songs circulating everywhere, and these folk songs were sharp daggers for those people's tyrants and for that feudal evil force. It is said that the first folk song quoted above originated from an old farmer, who was later captured by Yan's bandit gang and "beheaded for public display." But, no matter what, these poems of the laboring people were not and could not be extinguished. What does this illustrate? This illustrates the consistency and integration of the laboring people's poetry with the laboring people's class-based, lived, and fighting interests!
    Let's listen again:
    In the morning, you're a regular soldier,
    In the afternoon, you go into battle and can't save your life.
    In the morning, you're a regular soldier for Yan's bandits, and in the afternoon, you can't save your life. Why? This not only reflects the bravery and irresistibility of the Chinese People's Liberation Army but also illustrates how powerless and impossible it is for feudal warlords to grab some soldiers from the poorest strata to support their reactionary political rule!
    After the Jinzhong Campaign last year, the people of Jinzhong sang:
    Linfen is made of iron,
    Taiyuan is made of paper!
    This not only expressed the wishes of the people of Jinzhong but also expressed the firm belief that the People's Liberation Army would definitely be able to take Taiyuan. Then they sang:
    Yan Xishan is finished,
    Soldier-peasant unity is no more,
    The treasure pot is smashed,
    The money tree is broken,
    The twelve high-ranking cadres have no food!
    Like this, it not only expresses the joy of the laboring people after liberation, but it is also a very good funeral song for Yan's bandit gang's feudal little court. The poetry of the laboring people can give the reactionary ruling class a great shock!
    As for the vivid examples in the struggle of the masses, there are even more:
    The market town temple (Taoist temple),
    Is a good place,
    Pine trees grow on stone slabs;
    Lift the stone slabs and see,
    They grow on the backs of the poor!
    Indeed, "This is such a meaningful and powerful poem" (Comrade Zhou Yang's words). For example, in the struggle against local bullies, the following appeared:
    When I walk toward the Liu family,
    My whole body trembles,
    I'm not afraid of anything else,
    Just afraid of his scales and measures.
    These are all able to express the voice of the laboring people very well and can also profoundly expose the exploitative essence of the landlord class.
    During the land reform in Jinnan, as the hired peasant Wan Tingyuan shouted at the mass meeting:
    Chairman Mao's law (note: referring to the Outline Land Law),
    Is our people's law.
    Embrace it as one breath,
    Twist it into one rope,
    To turn over, everyone must contribute;
    Made of steel,
    Beaten of iron,
    The Communist Party leads,
    Our gang is like a cannonball,
    Falling on Old Chiang's family (note: referring to Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary clique),
    Falling on the landlord's family,
    Don't let it be a dud!
    How sharp and powerful this is! It is not only full of strong and enthusiastic fighting spirit but also full of clear class resentment; at the same time, it also embodies what Lenin said: the great potential power of revolution, regeneration, and revival hidden within the laboring people! These are all poems that have played a considerable political role in the land reform movement. The laboring people remember it, spread it, and they believe in the power of the language of their own poems. They cannot but sing, and cannot but chant. Yes, their language, their poetry, is powerful and combative because their lives themselves are powerful and combative. I remember Mayakovsky once said: "My poetry - is a flag, is a bomb" (I don't have the book at hand, but that's the general idea). But who says that Wan Tingyuan's few lines are not "flags" and "bombs"? Indeed, the laboring people love these poems because these poems have given their struggles great education and encouragement. Their poems are full of the class spirit of the laboring people; their poems are also in line with the interests of their class. They cannot be separated from poetry. They support this form that can express their own thoughts, feelings, hopes, life, and will, because, in the cultural and spiritual realm of the laboring people, poetry - is a very important weapon of their struggle!

    Two:
    The creativity of the laboring people is rich and great. This is especially true in this new era of the masses. Because the shackles of thousands of years of enslavement have been broken, and they have turned over in politics, economy, and culture, their throats appear even more sonorous and loud. This not only demonstrates the rich and great creativity of the laboring people, but also truly produced countless excellent works and countless nameless poets and writers.
    For the sake of illustration, we might as well cite some examples of the poetry created by the workers, peasants and soldiers themselves. I remember last winter, when passing through Jizhong, I read the following poem on the wall of a village:
    Good grass feeds warhorses,
    Good rice grinds military rations;
    Strong soldiers and strong horses,
    Capture Old Chiang alive!
    This is only four lines, but the theme is positive, and it can indeed vividly and concretely express the enthusiasm of the new peasants for joining the army, supporting the front, and supporting the People's Liberation War after they turned over.
    In the army, soldiers write their poems on their gun barrels, artillery tubes, door panels, and roadsides. We saw a lot of them last year on the way to Taiyuan. This kind of poem can be written by comrades from cadres to cooks. Some have been printed into booklets, so there is no need to cite many examples. For example, the steamed bun poem I read in a certain newspaper last month was very good. The original lines of the poem are:
    Steamed bun is fragrant,
    Steamed bun is fragrant,
    Eat steamed buns and hand over more guns!
    This was written by Comrade Chen Deshui, a cook in our People's Liberation Army. When the soldiers saw it, they wrote another poem together and pasted it on the wooden bucket containing the steamed buns and brought it back to Comrade Chen Deshui. They wrote:
    Steamed bun is good,
    Steamed bun is good,
    Beat Old Chiang so he has nowhere to escape!
    It seems that those poems are too simple, but just this simple singing and echoing expresses the fighting spirit and confidence in killing the enemy of the People's Liberation Army.
    As for the creations of workers after the successive liberation of major cities, they are even more prominent, and their collections have already been published. For example, Spinning Girl's Song and Sunshine Shines into Everyone's Home are both good examples. Not long ago, I read some machinery songs compiled by Comrade Cao Ming, such as "The Planer Turns Over," which described the mood of the workers after the nature of the factory fundamentally changed from the contrast between the lives of workers before and after liberation. Several of them can express the new relationship between workers and factories and machines under the leadership of the Communist Party today.
    As written in "I'm Sorry, Big Saw!" by the sawmill worker Zheng Lianqi:
    My hands are clumsy, the saw blades are damaged in stacks,
    I don't know how to do it, the damaged saw blades are piled up like mountains,
    My hands are clumsy, pressing on the saw blades often causes cracks,
    The red pine wood is not wrong, it's just my fault,
    ………
    This mood of condemning one's own work is very touching. This can all express the awakening of the working class and the improvement of the sense of revolutionary responsibility after liberation. Indeed, in the poems of many workers, it is not difficult for us to see their production enthusiasm, the consciousness of discipline, and the new labor concepts and labor attitudes that have been universally established.
    In recent years, we have indeed read too many songs of turned-over peasants, gun barrel poems of soldiers, and works of new workers. In their works, they not only fully express the actual conditions of politics, economy, culture, and life in this new era; but also express the spirit, intelligence, character, and demeanor of the laboring people in this new era. Their creativity is rich and great. They can use their own extremely fresh, vivid, lively, concise, profound, sharp, and sensually vibrant language to express their own thoughts, feelings, hopes, life, and will. Although in terms of quality, these poems are still in the budding stage; but in terms of quantity, they are indeed profuse. Naturally, so-called profuse does not mean that the poetry of workers, peasants and soldiers has been raised to its due political and artistic height. However, this vigorous and emerging poetic movement that is growing among the broad masses of the laboring people is enough to show its unlimited, growing and growing future! At the same time, it clearly points out the path that our so-called more processed poetry creation should take! Therefore, we must pay attention to the creations of these workers, peasants and soldiers. I remember Lenin taught writers when he said: "Even if the new seedlings are often weaker than the old ones at the beginning, don't be disappointed, because the future still belongs to them."
    Chairman Mao told us: "Literary and artistic treasures originally exist in the lives of the people. These are things in their natural state, they are rough things, but they are also the most vivid, the most abundant, and the most basic things. They pale in comparison to all processed forms of literature and art. They are the inexhaustible and only source of all processed forms of literature and art." Yes, "Promising writers and artists must go to the masses, must go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, to the fiery struggle, to the only, most extensive, and most abundant source."
    I think, if a writer leaves these, then nothing can be talked about. Not to mention creation, let alone improvement. Therefore, in poetry creation, the current problem is still how to combine more deeply with workers, peasants and soldiers with leadership, planning, and step-by-step; that is to say, to go deep into factories, deep into the countryside, and deep into the army, to face squarely the seedlings of this worker, peasant and soldier poetry creation, on their existing foundation, through them, gradually and widely popularize it, and gradually improve it month by month and year by year. This existing new worker, peasant and soldier poetry movement is waiting to be consolidated, promoted, and developed; countless new worker, peasant and soldier poets are also waiting to be helped and cultivated. Some revolutionary poetry workers from petty-bourgeois origins must also combine deeply with their lives, thoughts, emotions, and will in this way, "long-term and unconditionally," in order to talk about transformation and improvement, and to truly create good poems that they like to hear and see. I think this cannot but be the basic problem of the new poetry movement, and it cannot but be the basic problem of the new poetry creation.

　　学诗断想之一：
    纪初阳
    劳动人民是热爱自己或热爱能够充份地表现他们自己底思想、感情、生活、意志的诗歌的。不论在怎样的时代里，他们都有自己的诗歌创作，他们没有离开过诗歌。因为，劳动人民的诗歌在劳动人民的文化精神领域里，是一种有传统性的，很主要的斗争武器！
    远的不必去说它了，仅从近几年来所搜集到的一些劳动人民的诗歌创作来看，就足能有力的说明这一点。如在战犯阎锡山统治时期的晋中地区曾流行着这样两首反“兵农合一”的歌谣：
    “兵农合一”真正好，
     不长庄稼光长草，
     看着土地耗荒了！
     “兵农合一”聚宝盆，
     聚来聚去没了人，
     家破人亡鬼吹灯！
    虽然，这只是一反一正的几句，但这渗透着劳动人民生活的，阶级的实感；也确能用它来揭露了战犯阎锡山反动统治的实质。劳动人民，并凭着它，对于战犯阎锡山的黑暗措施给以有力的打击。在晋中地区，我们是到处都可以听到一些反阎歌谣在流传的，这些歌谣对于那些人民的暴君们，对于那种封建恶势力，不能不是锐利的匕首。据说，前边所举的第一首歌谣最初是出于一个老农之口，后来，这老农被阎家匪帮捉住，“枭首示众”了。但，不论怎样，这些劳动人民的诗歌并没有被灭绝，也不能被灭绝。这说明了什么呢？这说明了劳动人民的诗歌之与劳动人民阶级的，生活的，战斗的利益的一致和结合！
    我们再听罢：
    上午当了常备兵，
    下午出阵不保命。
    上午当了阎匪的常备兵，下午出阵就保不住牲命，为什么呢？这不仅反映了中国人民解放军的英勇和不可抗，同时也说明了：封建军阀们想从最贫苦阶层抓来的一些士兵去支持他底反动的政治统治该是如何的无力和怎样的没有可能！
    在去年晋中战役之后，晋中人民唱道：
    铁打的临汾呵，
    纸糊的太原呵！
    这不仅仅表白了晋中人民的愿望，也表示了人民解放军一定能打下太原来的坚强信心。接着他们又唱了：
    阎锡山完蛋啦，
    兵农合一不办啦，
    聚宝盆打烂啦，
    摇钱树折断啦，
    十二个高干没饭啦！
    象这，又不仅表现了劳动人民在解放后的欢快，同时，这也是一首很好的对于阎家匪帮的封建小朝廷的送葬曲。劳动人民的诗歌是能够给反动统治阶级以莫大震动的！
    至于在群众的斗争中，那生动的实例就更多：
    集镇庙（道士庙），
    好地方，
    松树长在石板上；
    揭开石板看，
    长在穷人脊背上！
    的确，“这是一首多么含意深长充满力量的诗”（周扬同志语）呵。又如在反恶霸斗争中出现的：
    我朝刘家走，
    浑身就发抖，
    别的都不怕，
    就怕他的秤和斗。
    这些是都能够很好的倾吐出劳动人民的心声的，也是能深刻地揭露出地主阶级的剥削本质的。
    在冀南进行土地改革时，如雇农万廷元在群众大会上喊出的：
    毛主席的法（按：指土地法大纲），
    就是咱人民的法。
    抱成一个气，
    拧成一股劲，
    要翻身就得人人都出力；
    钢作的，
    铁打的，
    共产党领导，
    咱这伙子好比一个炮弹呀，
    落到老蒋家（按：指蒋匪及其反动集团），
    落到地主家，
    可别叫它哑巴啦！
    这又是何等的锋锐、有力！它不只充沛着壮旺的、热烈的斗争情绪，也饱含鲜明的阶级愤恨；同时，也体现了如列宁所说的：在劳动人民他们里面所藏有的革命、再生、与复兴之潜在的伟大的力量！这都是曾经在土地改革运动中起过相当大的政治作用的诗歌，劳动人民记着它，传诵着它，他们相信他们自己的这些诗底语言的力量，他们是不能不歌的，也不能不唱。是的，他们的语言，他们的诗是有力量的，战斗的，因为他们的生活的本身就是有力量的，和战斗的。记得马耶可夫斯基曾说过：“我的诗——是旗帜，是炸弹”（手头无书，大意如此）。但又有谁说万廷元的这几句诗不是“旗帜”和“炸弹”呢？诚然，劳动人民是热爱这些诗歌的，因为这些诗歌，曾给他们的斗争以巨大的教育和鼓舞。他们的诗歌，是充满着劳动人民的阶级的精神的；他们的诗歌也正与他们的阶级的利益相符合。他们离不开诗歌，他们拥护能表达出他们自已的思想、感情、希望、生活和意志的这一形式，因为，在劳动人民的文化精神领域里，诗歌——是他们很主要的一种斗争的武器！
    之二：
    劳动人民的创造力是丰富的、伟大的。这尤其是在这新的群众的时代里，由于几千年奴役的铐枷被打碎，在政治、经济、文化上都翻了身，他们的喉咙是显得更加雄浑和响亮的。这不仅表现了劳动人民的丰富的、伟大的创造性，同时也底确产生了无数优秀的作品和无数无名的诗人作家。
    为了便于说明，我们不妨再就工农兵自己的诗歌创作，举出一些实例来。记得去冬过冀中时，在某村墙上曾读到这样一首诗：
    好草喂战马，
    好米碾军粮；
    兵强马强，
    活捉老蒋！
    这只四句，但主题性积极，同时也确乎能生动、具体的表现出新的农民在翻身以后，对于参军、支前，和拥护人民解放战争的热情来。
    在部队里士兵们把他们的诗则写在枪杆上、炮筒上、门板上、路边，我们去年在去向太原的路上就看到不少。这种诗是从干部到炊事员同志都能写，有的已印发成册，可不必多举，象在上月某报上读到的一首馒头诗就很好。诗的原句是：
    馒头香，
    馒头香，
    吃了馒头多缴枪！
    这是我们人民解放军里一个炊事员陈得水同志写的，战士们看到还合着写了一首贴在装馒头的木桶上，给陈得水同志带了回去，他们写：
    馒头好，
    馒头好，
    打得老蒋没处逃！
    看起来那些诗都太简单了，但只这简单的一唱一合便表现了人民解放军的战斗士气，杀敌信心。
    至于在各大城市相继解放后，工人的创作更凸出，并已有他们的选集出版，如纺纱女工歌，太阳照进众人家，便都是较好的例子。又不久前曾读到草明同志辑的一些机械歌，如其中有一首是“刨床翻身”，是从解放前后工人生活的对比中，道出了在工厂的性质基本上改变了以后的工人们的心境。有几首则都能表现出在今天共产党领导下，工人和工厂、机器的新的关系。
    象在火锯工人郑连歧的“对不起你呀，大锯！”里所写的：
    手头拙，锯条坏的成了垛，
    不会干，锯条坏的堆成山，
    大笨手，压出锯条爱断口，
    红松木，它没错来只怪我，
    ………
    这种对于自己的工作谴责的心绪是很动人的，这都能表现出在解放以后工人阶级觉悟及对于革命责任感的提高。底确是在许多工人的诗歌中，我们都不难看出他们的生产积极性，纪律的自觉性，和普遍树立起来的那种新的劳动观念和劳动态度。
    些年来，我们底确是读到过太多太多这样的翻身农民的歌谣，部队战士的枪杆诗，以及新工人的作品，在他们的作品里不仅充分的表现了这新的时代的政治、经济、文化、生活的实况；同时也表现出了这新时代劳动人民的精神、智力、性格和风貌。他们的创造力是丰富的，伟大的，他们能够用他们自己的极其新鲜、生动、活泼、简练、深刻、锐利、富有感性的生机的语言，来表现抒发他们自己的思想、感情、希望、生活和意志。虽然就质来说，这些诗歌还是萌芽状态的东西；但就量来说，确是丛生的。自然，所谓丛生不等于说：工农兵的诗歌已提高到它应有的政治的、艺术的高度，然而，这种在广大劳动群众中正在滋生着的一种蓬勃的新生的诗歌运动，却足以显示出它不可限量的、壮大和成长的前途！同时也清楚地指出了我们所谓加工较多的诗歌创作应走的道路！因此，我们必须重视这些工农兵的创作。记得列宁教导作家们时曾讲过：“即令新的幼芽在开始时常常比旧的要微弱些，也不要失望，因为将来仍是属于他们的。”
    毛主席告诉我们说：“人民生活中本来存在着文学艺术的矿藏，这是自然形态的东西，是粗糙的东西，但也是最生动、最丰富、最基本的东西，它们使一切加工形态的文学艺术相形见绌，它们是一切加工形态的文学艺术的取之不尽、用之不竭的唯一的源泉”。是的，“有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全身心地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中”去。
    我想，如果一个作家离开这些，便是什么也谈不到的。不要说创作，更不要说什么提高。所以在诗歌创作上，当前的问题仍然是如何有领导的，有计划的，有步骤的更深入一步与工农兵结合的问题；那就是说要深入工厂，深入农村，深入部队，正视这种工农兵诗歌创作的苗芽，就他们的现有基础，通过他们，逐步广泛的普及开去，逐日逐月逐年的提高起来。这种已有的新的工农兵的诗歌运动正待去巩固，推动和发展；无数新的工农兵诗人也正待去帮助和培养。一些革命的小资产阶级出身的诗歌工作者们也必须如此的深入的与他们的生活、思想、情绪、意志结合起来，“长期的、无条件的”，才能谈到改造和提高，才能真的创造出为他们所喜闻乐见的好的诗歌来。我想这不能不是新诗歌运动的基本问题，也不能不是新诗歌创作的基本问题。
