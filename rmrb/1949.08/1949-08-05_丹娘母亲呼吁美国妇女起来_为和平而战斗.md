Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: Moscow Dispatch: The mother of the Soviet hero Kosmodemyanskaya (i.e., Dan Niang's mother), who tragically sacrificed her life in the war against the Hitlerite bandits, and a Soviet teacher, recently wrote an open letter to an American female teacher named Elizabeth. The two met at the World Peace Congress in Paris. Kosmodemyanskaya wrote: I am writing this letter to you because the rulers of your country are trying to plunge humanity into the tragic abyss of a new war. American women must stop this conspiracy. Elizabeth, do you remember what an American journalist said at the Peace Congress, quoted by Yevgenia Golden: "The greatest danger is women; they are very influential in the United States, and they are unwilling to send their sons or husbands to war." This statement shows that if you and the women of your country can take the cause of peace into your own hands, war will not break out. The letter then described how the war took away her two children - her daughter Zoya (i.e., Dan Niang) died under the hangman's noose after engaging in guerrilla warfare, and her son Alexander sacrificed his life in battle. She wrote: My Zoya was still shouting words of truth when she was placed under the gallows with a noose around her neck. Let this scene inspire you to tell the truth to your people, even when threatened by the notorious Un-American Activities Committee, and demand peace and democracy. In the name of my dead children and the tens of thousands of young heroes who sacrificed themselves for the happiness of mankind, I appeal to you: fight for peace! Expose the warmongers!

    丹娘母亲呼吁美国妇女起来
    为和平而战斗
    【新华社北平三日电】莫斯科讯：在对希特勒匪帮的战争中惨遭牺牲的苏联英雄的母亲、苏联的教师柯斯莫捷姆扬斯卡娅（按即丹娘的母亲）近写给美国的一位女教师依丽莎伯一封公开信。她们两人曾在巴黎世界和平大会上会面。柯斯莫捷姆扬斯卡娅写道：我写这封信给你，是因为你们国家的统治者正企图把人类投入新战争的悲惨的深渊。美国妇女必须阻止这个阴谋计划。依丽莎伯，你还记不记得尤琴尼·戈登在和平大会上引用的一个美国记者所说的那段话：“最大的危险是妇女；她们在美国是极有影响的，她们不愿把自己的儿子或丈夫送去打仗。”这段话说明了：如果你和你们全国的妇女能够把和平事业掌握在自己手里的话，战争就打不起来的。该信接着叙述战争怎样夺去了她两个儿女——女儿佐雅（即丹娘）因从事游击战死在法西斯刽子手的绞绳下，儿子亚历山大在战斗中牺牲。她写道：我的佐雅在被放在绞刑架下脖子套上绞绳时，还在高呼真理的名言。让这一情景鼓舞你们，即使在受到声名狼藉的非美活动委员会威胁的时候，也要把真理告诉你们的人民，要求和平与民主。我以死去的儿女和成千成万为人类幸福而捐躯的青年英雄的名义，向你们呼吁：为和平而战斗！揭露战争贩子！
