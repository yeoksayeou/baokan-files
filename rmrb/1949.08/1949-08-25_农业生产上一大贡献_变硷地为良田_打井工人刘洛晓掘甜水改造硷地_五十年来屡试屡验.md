　　A Great Contribution to Agricultural Production
    Transforming Alkaline Land into Fertile Fields
  　Well Digger Liu Luoxiao Excavates Sweet Water to Improve Alkaline Land
    Proven Effective Over Fifty Years
    [Our Newspaper] Liu Luoxiao, a 70-year-old worker from Nanloudi Village, An Guo First District, has invented a method to transform alkaline water into sweet water and alkaline land into fertile land. Over the past fifty years, he has promoted the organization of over sixty sweet water well teams (eight people per team) in Nanloudi Village, transforming over 5,000 mu of barren alkaline land into a rich and productive farmland. For hundreds of years, the vast plains north and south of the Yellow River have suffered from soil alkalization, resulting in a significant reduction in arable land and difficulty in obtaining drinking water as well water turned bitter. During the Boxer Rebellion in the Qing Dynasty, the Japanese invented a method of using conical wells to extract clear spring water from underground. Later, Yang Baoshan, a farmer from Raoyang, invented the iron pipe well drilling method. However, these methods were not suitable for areas with deep underground springs, and due to poor drilling techniques, the well water often turned bitter again after becoming sweet, making it difficult to promote and adopt universally. Liu Luoxiao has been diligently studying well drilling methods since he was eighteen years old, focusing on the investigation of soil quality, water properties, and the habits of various crops. As a result, he invented over ten well drilling methods, including the mud water pipe irrigation method and the eighty-gauge steel wire cloth-covered brown pipe method. In 1935, Liu Luoxiao's well drilling method was promoted in several places in Hebei, creating a well drilling boom. The well drilling teams in Nanloudi Village developed to more than sixty teams, with more than forty well drilling rigs. According to reporter investigations, Liu Luoxiao's well drilling method is indeed effective in transforming alkaline land into fertile fields. There are currently over 1,000 mu of garden land southeast of Nanloudi Village, of which over 500 mu were originally alkaline land and were transformed into garden land after well drilling. However, drilling a well using this method requires approximately 10,000 jin of millet, which is unaffordable for ordinary farmers under the current conditions. Only with strong government support can it be widely implemented.

　　农业生产上一大贡献
    变硷地为良田
  　打井工人刘洛晓掘甜水改造硷地
    五十年来屡试屡验
    【本报讯】安国一区南楼底村七十岁的老工人刘洛晓，创造了变硷水为甜水，改硷地为良地的方法。五十年来，他曾经推动南楼底村组织过六十多队甜水井班（每班八人），把五千亩以上的不毛硷地，变成了特产富饶的田园。数百年来，黄河南北广大平原因土质翻硷，致耕地面积大为减缩，井水变苦，吃水也发生困难。清庚子年时，日本人曾创造锥井引出地下清泉之法；后饶阳农民杨宝善又创造铁管打井法；这些方法都不适合地下泉深的地方，且因打井方法不善，井水变甜后常易转苦，颇难普遍推广采用。刘洛晓从十八岁时即努力钻研打井方法，专心考察土质、水性及各种庄稼的习性，结果创造了胶泥水灌管打井法，八十号钢丝布夹棕色管法等十余种打井方法。一九三五年，河北若干地方推行刘洛晓的打井法，曾一度造成打井高潮。南楼底村的打井队发展到六十余队，有打井架子四十余盘。据记者考察，该刘洛晓的打井法实有变硷地为良田的功效。南楼底村东南现有园地一千余亩，其中有五百余亩原系硷地，打井后才变成园地的。但以此法打井，每眼需用小米约一万斤，一般农民在目前条件下无法负担，唯有政府大力扶助，始能普遍开展。
