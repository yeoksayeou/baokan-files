The participants unanimously expressed the will of the Soviet Union's 200 million people to defend peace in their speeches, and urged the democratic camp to strengthen unity.

Speakers at the morning session included Azerbaijani writer Ibragimov, President of the Uzbek Republic Academy of Sciences Salimsakov, Soviet People's Artist Khorava, composer Khrennikov, Kazakh youth organization representative Kanapin, Moldavian writer Kruchinyuk, Leningrad Stakhanovite worker Dubinin, trade union representative Kazinoni, and Belarusian poet Kolas.

Among the foreign guests were Lin Qiangyun, one of the leaders of the Chinese Trade Union, Dragoscheva, Chairman of the Bulgarian People's Women's League, Professor Du Bois (USA), member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, and German people's leader Eisler.

　　Azerbaijani writer Ibragimov said: The All-Soviet Peace Conference shows that all progressive mankind, led by the powerful Soviet Union, is determined to defend peace and curb the conspiracies of Churchill, Truman, Attlee, Bevan and others to instigate a new war. No force can save the inevitable death of capitalism! In our time, all roads lead to communism. The people of no country in the world want war. Working people and intellectuals in all countries who are loyal to their countries are against war.

　　Professor Dymbowski, Chairman of the Polish National Peace Committee, said, "We have powerful weapons in our hands. Newspapers, publications, and radio are all used by us. We are educating the youth. We can establish close ties with the broad masses of the people and easily expose the propaganda carried out by the Anglo-American imperialist warmongers and their Yugoslav servants."

　　Salimsakov, President of the Uzbek Republic Academy of Sciences, said: "We have enough power and methods to stop a new war and realize our noble ideals and aspirations, making our lives more beautiful day by day. Therefore, our first concern is peace."

　　Soviet artist Khorava said: The whole world understands that the fate of the world depends on the struggle for peace. For the sake of life, for the sake of love between people, for the sake of the people of the world, for the sake of culture, the Soviet people are leading all peace-loving people in the struggle for peace.

　　Soviet People's Calmness and Power Encourages Our Courage to Fight
　　Guests from Various Countries Speak Enthusiastically

　　Nanni (Italy), a member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, continued to speak, saying: Seven million Italian men and women signed a petition for peace against the Atlantic Pact, despite police terror. They do not believe that a third world war is inevitable. The Italian people sent us here and instructed us to declare that although American imperialism has managed to get the Italian ruling group to join the Atlantic Pact, they will never be able to get the Italian people to participate in a reactionary war. Now, as in the days of defending Stalingrad, your calmness and your power are encouraging us and giving us courage.

　　Gotinova, representative of the Czech Peace Committee, warmly congratulated the conference on behalf of the people of the Czechoslovak Republic. She said: The stronger the world of socialism and people's democracy, the weaker the capitalist system, and the stronger the peace front. We must expose the enemies of human happiness and the enemies of peace in time and convict them.

　　The delegates to the conference unanimously and warmly welcomed Jean Laffitte, Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress and French writer. He said that this conference will further strengthen the belief of hundreds of millions of men and women that they have the ability to stop a new war. Men and women of all countries will be with all the people of the Soviet Union, using unity as a weapon to win victory in the struggle for peace.

　　Albanian writer and mass leader Sako declared in his speech: The Albanian people will fight for peace together with all democratic people. The cause of peace will be victorious because the struggle for peace and democracy is led by the powerful Soviet Union.

　　At the evening session on the 26th, Korneichuk, Vice-Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Conference, made a report on the composition of the conference. He declared: The Soviet working people have selected 1,200 representatives from various fraternal republics and states, representing 33 nationalities of the friendly family of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union to participate in the conference, including members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Academies of Sciences of various fraternal republics, the Academies of Agricultural Science, Teachers' Colleges, and Medicine, representatives of the Soviet Writers Association, the Central Committee of the All-Soviet Trade Union, the All-Soviet Association for the Popularization of Political and Scientific Knowledge, the Soviet Slavic Committee, the Women's and Youth Anti-Fascist Committee, and other groups, as well as representatives of 47 trade unions with 28.5 million Soviet workers. Four hundred women participated in the conference, and there were also many youth representatives at the conference.

Among the representatives were 26 Soviet heroes, 105 socialist labor heroes, 169 Stalin Prize winners, outstanding scientists, well-known writers, composers, painters, sculptors, film directors and actors.

　　The Soviet Union Is Our Most Reliable Friend, We Respect and Love the Soviet People
　　Our Representative Lin Qiangyun Speaks

　　Representatives from Britain, France, Italy, China, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Albania, Korea, the United States, Germany, Austria, and other countries also participated in the conference.

　　The delegates and guests attending the conference warmly welcomed Lin Qiangyun, the representative of the Chinese people. Lin Qiangyun said at the conference: We would like to tell you that the Chinese people love and respect the Soviet people. Since the October Revolution, we have known that the Soviet Union is the most reliable friend of the Chinese people. The Chinese people love peace, absolutely support peace, and are working tirelessly for peace together with other peace-loving nations. He said: The victory of the Chinese people in the liberation struggle is not only the victory of the Chinese people, but also the victory of the people all over the world who are fighting for peace.

　　Professor Du Bois (USA), member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, said: Millions of Americans have already joined the peace movement against war.

　　Nikolai, head of the delegation of the Russian Orthodox Church and Archbishop of Krutitsy and Kolomna, declared: The task of the conference is to tear off the hypocritical and stubborn masks from the sinister faces of the international robbers who are planning dark deeds and robbing roads.

　　Yershova, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Youth League, said in her speech: We most sincerely sympathize with the struggles of foreign youth. We pay tribute to you democratic and free youth fighters, to our young friends in France, Italy, Spain, and Western European countries under the Marshall Plan, and to the heroic sons and daughters of Greece who love freedom and defend the freedom of their motherland against attempts to enslave their motherland. Heroic Chinese democratic youth, we are with you. You have won glory in the struggle for liberation from the Kuomintang and foreign enslavement.

　　At this point, the conference on the 26th adjourned.

    捷和平委员会代表哥迪诺瓦，代表捷克斯洛伐克共和国的人民热烈地祝贺大会。她说：社会主义和人民民主的世界越强大，资本主义制度就越脆弱，而和平阵线也就越强大。必须及时揭发人类幸福的敌人、和平的敌人，并加以判罪。

    出席大会的代表和来宾们对中国人民的代表林锵云表示热烈欢迎。林锵云在会上说：我们愿告诉你们，中国人民热爱并尊敬苏联人民。从十月革命以来，我们就已认识苏联是中国人民最可靠的朋友。中国人民爱好和平，绝对支持和平，并且正和其他爱好和平民族一起为和平而不倦地斗争着。他说：中国人民在解放斗争中取得的胜利，不仅是中国人民的胜利，而且也是为和平而斗争的全世界人民的胜利。
    世界拥护和平常设委员会委员杜波依斯教授（美）称：数以百万计的美国人民业已参加了反对战争的和平运动。
