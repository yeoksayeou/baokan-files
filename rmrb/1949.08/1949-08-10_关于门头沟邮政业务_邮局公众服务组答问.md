To the Editor:

    The Mentougou Post Office was established in 1935. Before the July 7th Incident, it performed well. Postal money orders were often delayed because the amount allowed for a third-class office was limited, so there was a need to upgrade to a second-class office. Although this did not happen, mail delivery was twice daily, meaning letters to and from Pingmen would arrive on the same day or certainly the next day. After the Incident, it was moved to Shijingshan for various reasons, which was very inconvenient for the people of Mentougou. Mentougou is an industrial area near Beijing and Tianjin, and it is necessary to establish a second-class post office there. Can the two matters of restoring mail delivery twice a day be arranged soon?

Mr. Li Zige:

    There is already a postal organization in Mentougou handling various postal and remittance services. As for upgrading to a second-class post office, this Bureau will consider it based on the development of local business. If there is a need, it will be upgraded at any time.

    Regarding restoring daily mail service between Pingmen twice a day, after investigation, the second mail volume is small, so it has not been implemented yet. Whether to increase it once is currently under study.

    关于门头沟邮政业务
    邮局公众服务组答问编辑同志：
    门头沟邮局是民国二十四年设立的。延至七七事变前，成绩甚好，邮汇因三等局汇票额有限，应付不暇，已有升为二等局之必要，虽未实现，但邮件寄递往返已日必两次，即平门间之信件，当天可到或次日必到。事变后因故迁往石景山，门头人民即感觉十分不便。门头沟为平津附近工业区，实有设立二等邮局之必要，邮件往返恢复二次等两件事，最近能否办到？    李子萼李子萼先生：
    门头沟地方现已设有邮政机构，办理各项邮政及汇兑业务。至改设二等邮局一节，本局当视该地业务发展情况加以考虑，如有需要，随时改设。
    平门邮运恢复每日二次一节，经查因第二次往来邮件，为数不多，未即实行，将来是否增加一次，现正在研究办理中。
