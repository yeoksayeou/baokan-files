Carry out livestock epidemic prevention to protect livestock health
Zhao Qingsen

Various livestock infectious diseases are widespread in China. The most serious is rinderpest, which frequently plagues the regions south of the Yangtze River, the southwest, northwest, northeast provinces, and Mongolia. The number of deaths often reaches hundreds of thousands or even millions. Glanders (drooping nose) infects 10 to 30 percent of all mules and horses; horse mange (horse scabies) affects 10 percent of horses in the Northeast; anthrax, swine fever, and fowl plague also occur everywhere.

In recent years, outbreaks have occurred from time to time in North China. For example, this spring, in March and April, 1,008 cases of anthrax were reported in seven counties under the Bohai Administrative Office, including Yucheng, De County, Shaoping, Changshan, and Huimin, with 780 deaths. Last year, in March and April, 130 out of more than 200 livestock in Chakou Village, Wu'an County, Taihang District, died of anthrax within two or three months. Other areas, such as Jizhong, Pinggu Road, Jinan, and Jiluyu, also experienced anthrax outbreaks from time to time.

Rinderpest, which was prevalent in Duolun, Chabei, at the end of last year, spread to Baoyuan, Chongli, Zhangbei, and Chicheng, Sihai, Huairou, Longguan, Yanqing and other eight or nine counties in Jicha in February and March this year, followed by outbreaks in Yanbei and Pingxi, with more than 3,325 deaths.

Swine fever has been heard from time to time in Taihang, Taiyue, Jinan, Jizhong, Chahar, and Pingjin (recently, it is still prevalent in the suburbs of Pingjin) with a very high mortality rate; fowl plague is also prevalent everywhere; in addition, there are various unknown livestock infectious diseases, which occur sporadically or epidemically in various places from time to time.

In short, various livestock infectious diseases are very common in China. Coupled with the massive plunder and slaughter by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits over the years, the number of draught animals has decreased sharply, which has seriously affected agricultural production and the lives of farmers. Statistics from 69 typical villages in the entire Bohai Administrative Office show that the number of draught animals in 1945 was 67 percent of the pre-war level, a decrease of 33 percent compared with 1937. The total number of livestock required in the entire region is 1.2 million, while the existing number is only 800,000.

The reasons why livestock infectious diseases can be prevalent throughout the year are: (1) The scientific level of the general farmers is low, the feeding and management of livestock is poor, they stick to old rules and do not know how to improve, and they lack basic sanitation knowledge. They think that livestock die because they are destined to die and have nothing to do with infection, and they do not know how to implement isolation and prevention. Some people do not know that the meat of dead livestock contains germs that can be infectious, and they buy cheap meat to eat for profit, resulting in good opportunities for transmission. For example, Zhang Zongqiu of Xiaoyan Family, Shao Nian Dianzi District, Bohai District, bought a dead cow for one stone of soybeans in order to eat cheap meat. As a result, the cow he raised also died, and two cows in the neighbor's family also died. (2) There is a serious superstitious thinking among the masses. When livestock get sick, they do not seek medical treatment, but seek help from the Horse King, the Cow King, and the God of Plague. (3) The medical equipment is too poor, there are few veterinarians, and even fewer scientific veterinarians. In some places, no one takes care of sick livestock, and epidemic prevention drugs are not widely used; in addition, the general public has an incorrect idea of ​​despising veterinarians, thinking that learning veterinary medicine is a relatively low profession. (4) The veterinary organization is unsound, and even some areas have not been established. Health education is not enough, and when an epidemic occurs, people cannot be mobilized in time to pay attention to prevention and control, so that it spreads around and causes a large-scale epidemic in various places. (5) The general public does not pay enough attention to livestock, unless the epidemic is prevalent and there are many deaths, it cannot attract the attention of the general public.

If our governments at all levels can attach importance to this issue, use the existing veterinary institutions, and organize Chinese and Western veterinarians scattered in various places to vigorously carry out prevention and control, we can achieve great results. For example, during the rinderpest epidemic in Chabei this spring, the Industry Section of the Chabei Special Office and the Jicha Special Office reported to the Chahar Provincial Government in a timely manner. The Provincial Government immediately regarded it as a serious issue, discussed countermeasures overnight, and immediately sent people to investigate and diagnose the situation the next day. At the same time, technicians were hired and epidemic prevention drugs were purchased from Beiping; at the same time, an emergency order was issued, designating the two special districts of Chabei and Jicha as "livestock danger zones," closing traffic, disbanding cattle markets, and implementing isolation of healthy cattle and sick cattle in epidemic areas and non-epidemic areas. An epidemic prevention committee was established, instructing the two special districts to mobilize more than 3,000 cadres from all levels and agencies to go to the epidemic areas, extensively mobilize the masses to carry out isolation and disinfection, emphasize that preventing rinderpest and rescuing draught cattle is the most important task at present, organize local Chinese veterinarians to treat the disease, and prevent the spread of the epidemic. For example, after anthrax occurred in the Bohai District this spring, the Provincial Government and the Administrative Office immediately sent veterinarians to the epidemic areas to cooperate with local administrative personnel in rescue, and went to Beiping to purchase anthrax vaccine serum, organized short-term training for local Chinese veterinarians, and formed rescue teams to carry out prevention and control in various places. As a result, 22,751 livestock were treated and vaccinated, and the epidemic was quickly brought under control.

From this, we feel that to eradicate livestock epidemics and protect livestock health, we must train a large number of veterinary epidemic prevention talents, improve the veterinary epidemic prevention and control institutions at all levels, and conduct livestock epidemic surveys and prevention and control work in various places. In the actual prevention and control work, we must: First, combine with administrative cadres to extensively launch mass epidemic prevention work. This spring, more than 100 medical staff participated in the epidemic prevention team in Chabei, the local government dispatched more than 3,000 cadres, and vigorously organized the local masses to carry out extensive mass prevention and control work, and as a result, rinderpest was quickly eradicated. Second, use scientific and technological to break the superstitious ideas of the masses. During the epidemic prevention in Chabei this time, the epidemic prevention team injected a sick calf in Daliuhao Village, Baoyuan County. The next day after the injection, it began to ruminate, eat grass, run and jump. The farmers happily said, "Fortunately, the gentlemen came to save my cow. If I relied on the Cow King and the Horse King, I am afraid it would not survive!" Third, launch publicity and education work, expose rumors, and eliminate unnecessary concerns of farmers. During the epidemic prevention in Chabei, when the epidemic prevention team first went to the countryside to implement preventive injections, the masses, based on the bad impression of being deceived by the enemy and puppet and Chiang Kai-shek government in the past, and with rumors saying that "after the injection, drawing cow blood, no calves will be born," "the injection is to investigate the number of cows, to be divided equally," "knowing the number of cows will send corvee," etc., produced many doubts and hindered the prevention and control work. After various publicity and explanations, they slowly accepted it. However, after the facts proved it, the farmers realized the benefits of epidemic prevention, and some chased dozens of miles to find the epidemic prevention team to inject their cows. Fourth, we must diagnose early, report in time, investigate the source of epidemics and carry out appropriate prevention. For example, the rinderpest in Chabei, after investigation, proved to be caused by 200 salt-transporting ox carts from Wuzhumuqin Banner in Inner Mongolia. More than 50 cattle died when they arrived in Duolun, and the local government failed to detect them in time, so they quickly spread to all parts of the province. Also, the ox carts running to Inner Mongolia returned from Zheng Baiqi and stayed at Zhang Yusheng Yingzi, which spread to northern Kangbao. The Inner Mongolia Trading Company trafficked 2,000 draught cattle from Beizi Temple, and five cattle died when they passed through Sanjia Village, Right Banner. After death, they were all skinned next to the public water pool, which led to the spread to various parts of Inner Mongolia. If these situations could be discovered in time, the source of the sick animals could be clarified, and the spread would not be so rapid and widespread. Fifth, regularly investigate infectious diseases in various places and carry out regular and universal preventive injections. Although the spring epidemic prevention in Chabei put out rinderpest after two months of effort, another rinderpest epidemic broke out in Zhangbei in June due to the failure to implement universal preventive injections. Sixth, implement mass epidemic prevention and hygiene education, improve the scientific level of the masses, so that livestock feeding and management methods can be improved, and epidemic prevention common sense is known to everyone.

China's agriculture has not yet reached the era of industrialization, and the use of animal power in agricultural production still occupies a very important position. The increase and decrease of draught animals have a direct impact on agricultural production. The breeding of other livestock is one of the important side occupations in rural areas, and the increase or decrease of livestock has a great impact on the rural economy and the lives of farmers. How to carry out livestock epidemic prevention work, protect the existing vast livestock in rural areas, and further improve them in quantity and quality is the responsibility of the current animal husbandry and veterinary workers, and it is also a major task in developing agricultural production.

　　开展家畜防疫保护牲畜健康
    赵庆森
    各种家畜的传染病，在中国流行地区甚广，最严重的如：牛瘟在江南、西南、西北、东北各省、蒙古各地时常流行，死亡数目，动辄达数十万至百万以上。马鼻疽（吊鼻子）感染率占全骡马的百分之十至三十；马癞（马疥癣）在东北发病者占百分之十；炭疽及猪瘟、鸡瘟等也到处发生。
    最近年来在华北各地时有流行如：炭疽病，今春三四月间，渤海行署的禹城、德县、邵平、长山、惠民等七个县即有一千零八头发病，死亡达七百八十头之多；去年三四月间太行区武安县茶口村，全村共有牲畜二百多，二三个月内死于炭疽者即达一百三十头；其他如冀中，平古路、冀南、冀鲁豫各地，亦时有炭疽病发生。
    牛瘟，去年年底在察北多伦一带流行，今年二、三月间蔓延至宝源、崇礼、张北、及冀察之赤城、四海、怀柔、龙关县、延庆等八九个，接着雁北、平西也续有发生，死亡达三千三百二十五头以上。
    猪瘟在太行、太岳、冀南、冀中、察省、平津等地时有所闻（最近平郊各地尚在流行）死亡率甚大；鸡瘟也是到处流行；其他尚有不明之各种家畜传染病，亦时在各地呈散在性，或流行性的发生。
    总之在中国各地，各种家畜的传染病很普遍的流行着，更加之日寇与蒋匪连年的大量掠夺与宰杀，因此造成耕畜数目急剧减少，严重的影响了农业生产，及农民的生活。全渤海行署六十九个典型村统计一九四五年的耕畜为战前的百分之六十七，比一九三七年减少了百分之三十三。全区所需牲畜数目为一百二十万头，而现有数仅八十万头。
    家畜传染病所以能常年流行各地的原因为：（一）一般农民的科学水平较低，家畜的饲养管理不良，墨守旧规不知改善，卫生常识更属缺乏，认为牲口死是该死，不关传染的事，更不知实行隔离预防。有的不知死牲口肉附有病菌可以传染，图便宜买贱肉吃，结果造成传播的好机会。例如渤海区邵年店子区小言家张宗球图吃便宜肉，以一石豆子买了一头死牛，结果自己喂的牛也死了，邻家的牛也死了两头。（二）群众中严重的存在着迷信思想，牲口病了不知求医，而求救于马王爷、牛王爷、瘟神。（三）医药设备太差，兽医少，科学的兽医更少，有些地方牲口病了无人看，防疫药品也未能普遍应用；更加之一般人有轻视兽医不正确的想法，认为学兽医是一件比较下贱的职业。（四）兽医组织不健全，甚至有些地区就未建立起来。卫生教育不够，疫病发生，不能及时发动人民注意防治，以至辗转传播，造成各地的大流行。（五）一般人对于家畜的重视不够，除非疫病流行死亡很大时，不能引起一般人的注意。
    对于家畜疫病的流行，我们各级政府，能重视这一问题，利用现有的兽医机构，并能组织散在各地之中西兽医人员，大力进行防治，是能收到很大效果的。例如今春察北牛瘟的流行，察北专署实业科，冀察专署及时报告了察哈尔省府，省府当即作为一件严重的问题，连夜商讨对策，次日即派人前往调查诊断，同时到北平聘请技术人员及购买防疫药品；同时发出紧急命令，制定察北冀察两专区为“牲畜危险区”，封锁交通，解散牛市，实行疫区非疫区的健牛疫牛的隔离。并成立防疫委员会，指示两专区动员各级与各机关三千多干部分赴疫区，广泛动员群众进行隔离消毒，强调预防牛瘟抢救耕牛为当前头等重要工作，组织当地中兽医治疗，制止疫病之蔓延。又如渤海区今春发生炭疽后，省府及行署即刻派兽医人员分赴疫区，配合地方行政人员抢救，并赴北平购买炭疽疫苗血清，组织当地中兽医短期训练后，编成抢救小组到各地进行防治，结果二万二千七百五十一头牲畜，得到防治注射，流行很快被制止了。
    由此我们感觉要扑灭家畜疫病，保护牲畜健康，必须要大量培养兽医防疫人材，健全各级兽疫防治机构，进行各地兽疫调查及防治工作。在实地防治工作中必须：第一、结合行政干部广泛发动群众性防疫工作。今春察北防疫医务人员一百多人参加了防疫队，地方政府出动了三千以上的干部，并大力组织了当地的群众，展开了广泛的群众性防治工作，结果很快地把牛瘟扑灭了。第二、用科学技术打破群众的迷信思想。这次察北防疫中，防疫队在宝源县大六号村注射了一头发病的小牛，注射后第二天就开始反刍吃草和跑跳，农民高兴地说：“幸亏先生们来救了我的牛，要是靠牛王爷马王爷，恐怕活不了啦！”第三、展开宣教工作，揭破谣言，消除农民不必要的顾虑。察北防疫时，防疫队初下乡实行预防注射，群众根据过去敌伪和蒋匪政府对他们欺骗的恶劣印象，又加上有人造谣，说“打了针，抽牛血，就不生仔牛了”、“打针是调查牛数，要平分的”、“知道了牛数要派公差”等，产生很多疑惧思想，阻碍了防治工作进行。后经多方宣传解释，才慢慢地接受了。但事实证明后，农民认识了防疫好处，有追上几十里找防疫队给牛打针的。第四、要早期诊断，及时报告，调查疫病来源进行适当的防止。如察北的牛瘟，经调查证明是由内蒙乌珠木泌旗的运盐牛车二百辆至多伦时，牛死去了五十多头而传染的，地方政府又未能及时发现，所以很快的传至全省各地。又跑内蒙的牛车由正白旗归来，曾住宿张玉生营子，由此传到康保北部。内蒙贸易公司由贝子庙贩回耕牛二千头，路过右旗三家村时死牛五头，死后均在公用水池旁剥皮，致传染至内蒙各地。这些情况如能及时发现病畜，明了来源，就不会传染这么迅速广泛了。第五、经常调查各地传染病，进行定期的普遍的预防注射。察北春季防疫，虽经两个月的努力，把牛瘟扑灭了，但由于未能实施普遍预防注射，六月间张北一带又流行一次牛瘟。第六、实施群众防疫卫生教育，提高群众科学水平，使家畜饲养管理法得以改善，防疫常识人人皆知。
    中国目前农业未达工业化时期，农业生产中畜力的使用还占很重要的位置。耕畜的增加和减少，对农业生产就有直接影响，其他家畜的饲养是农村重要副业之一，家畜的增减对农村经济农民的生活，也有很大的影响。如何开展家畜防疫工作，保护农村现有的广大家畜，并进一步在数量上、质量上加以提高，是当前畜牧兽医工作者的责任，也是发展农业生产中的重大任务。
