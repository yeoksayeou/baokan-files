　　Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee Holds Symposium
  　Refuting the White Paper, Preparing for Battle (Continued from Yesterday)
　　Wang Baozhen
    In the White Paper, there are many attempts to sow discord between China and the Soviet Union. We must crush this US imperialist conspiracy and strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship through concrete cooperation. I was one of the earliest advocates for alliance with the Soviet Union. As early as 1921, I initiated the organization of the Russian Famine Relief Association to express sympathy for the Soviet revolution. There was extensive propaganda in Beijing and Shanghai. At the time, those who supported this association included Mr. Zhang Ximan, Mr. Shao Lizi, Mr. Wang Liming, and Mr. Yan Huiqing. We transported two trainloads of grain to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet government's Famine Relief Committee sent us a thank-you letter. At that time, I frequently interacted with Soviet envoys Joffe and Karakhan, and edited two issues of the association's publication, titled "Relief and Neighborly Assistance." In 1922, I also suggested to the government in the House of Representatives that it should quickly restore diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia, because at that time, European and American countries had not yet officially recognized the Soviet Union. I felt that the relationship between China and the Soviet Union was close, and we should recognize it first, without following the lead of Europe and America. Later, in Nanjing, I and Mr. Zhang Ximan initiated the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association. Why was I so enthusiastic about being pro-Soviet? My ideal is to hope that the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union will unite and jointly promote the world revolution.

　　Zhang Wen
    Just as the Chinese people are victoriously pursuing the enemy, the American Acheson published a thick White Paper, helplessly confessing the crimes of aggression against China, attempting to shirk responsibility for the defeat. Why did Acheson do this? In a word, it is the "ghost fight" of the American reactionaries, hoping to finally salvage its failure.
    The so-called new trick is Acheson's fantasy that Chinese "democratic individualism" will rise, and that these people will eventually win. However, most of these people have become sober! We must further unite and educate them, expand the united front, in order to accelerate the overall victory.
    We not only have the strength to win a complete victory in China, but we can also unite under the leadership of the Soviet Union in the democratic and peaceful camp, and completely eliminate the aggressive forces of US imperialism throughout the world, so that mankind can achieve true peace.

　　Wu Maosun
    The US imperialist conspiracy exposed by the White Paper is very obvious; how should we crush the US imperialist conspiracy? First, we should frankly examine whether we have ever had illusions about US imperialism in the past, and what those illusions were? Comrade He Xiangning just said that she had illusions about the old democracy of the United States thirty years ago. Her spirit of frank self-examination is worthy of our emulation. We should first wash away all the dregs of illusions about US imperialism. Second, we should strive to unite the "middle or right wing outside the Kuomintang reactionaries". We should patiently educate and persuade them to win them over to our people's side. Third, we should rectify the democratic revolutionary camp and not allow the US imperialist conspiracy to establish an opposition to succeed. When we were in Hong Kong, American reporters kept coming to bother us. Many facts have proved that US imperialism has long been carrying out this conspiracy. Therefore, we must be vigilant and strictly prevent disguised elements from sneaking into the democratic camp.

　　Li Minxin
    The Revolutionary Committee has the basic task of educating and transforming those in the Kuomintang whose thinking is backward and erroneous. It should improve its organization and strengthen learning and criticism in order to educate and transform them without being influenced by them. Comrade He Xiangning said, "Dare to struggle." I highly agree. However, in order to have the courage to struggle greatly, we must first have a correct understanding. In order to have understanding, we must start from learning.

　　Lü Jiyi
    The White Paper specifically proposes that so-called "democratic individualism" will be "encouraged." We in the democratic camp should take this opportunity to do a clarifying work, straighten our steps, and strengthen our defenses. The imperialists' conspiracies and tricks will ultimately fail.

### 国民党革命委员会举行座谈会　驳斥白皮书准备战斗（续昨）

　　国民党革命委员会举行座谈会
  　驳斥白皮书准备战斗（续昨）
　　王葆真
    白皮书中，不少挑拨离间中苏友谊之处，我们粉碎美帝这一阴谋，要以具体合作的实际，加强中苏友好工作。本人主张联苏最早，在民国十年首先倡导组织俄国灾荒赈济会，表示同情苏联革命，在北京在上海曾有广大的宣传，当时赞成此会者，有张西曼、邵力子、王立明、颜惠庆诸先生，曾运赈粮两列车到苏联，苏联政府赈灾委员会有给我们的谢函。当时与苏联特使越飞、加拉罕常相往还，并编辑会刊两册，题曰“救灾恤邻”。民十一年，又在众议院建议政府，速即恢复苏俄国交，因为当时欧美各国尚未正式承认苏联，我觉得中苏关系密切，应当首先承认，不必尾随欧美，其后又在南京同张西曼先生发起中苏文化协会，为什么本人如此热烈亲苏呢？我的理想，是希望中苏两大民族联合起来，共同促成世界的革命。
　　张文
    正当中国人民胜利追击敌人的时候，美国的艾奇逊发表了一本厚厚的白皮书，无可奈何的供出侵华罪状，企图推卸失败的责任。艾奇逊为什么这样做呢？一句话是美国反动派的“鬼打鬼”，希图最后挽救它的失败。
    所谓新花样是艾奇逊幻想中国“民主个人主义”抬头，幻想这些人物最终获得胜利。然而，这些人大都清醒起来了！我们更要团结教育他们，扩大统一战线，以加速全面的胜利。
    我们不仅有力量在中国获得全胜，我们更能团结于以苏联为首的民主和平阵线下，把美帝在全世界的侵略势力也完全消灭，让人类获得真正和平。
　　吴茂荪
    白皮书所暴露的美帝阴谋是非常显明的；我们应该怎样粉碎美帝阴谋呢？第一，我们应该坦白检讨我们过去对美帝是否曾经有过幻想，有那些幻想？刚才何香凝同志说她三十年前对美国的旧民主也曾有过幻想，她这种坦白自我检讨的精神，是值得我们大家效法的。我们首先应该把一切对美帝幻想的渣滓洗刷干净。第二，我们应该努力争取团结“国民党反动派以外的中间派或右派”，对于他们我们要耐心教育，说服，争取他们站在我们人民方面来。第三，我们应该整肃民主革命阵营，不容美帝树立反对派的阴谋得逞。在香港时，不断有美国记者来找我们麻烦，许多事实都证明了美帝早已在进行这项阴谋了。因此，我们必须提高警觉，严防伪装分子钻进民主阵营来。
　　李民欣
    革命委员会有教育改造国民党人之思想落后及错误者的基本任务，自应健全组织，加强学习与批评，方能教育改造他们，而不至被他们进来影响我们。何香凝同志说：“放胆斗争”，我极赞同，但欲大斗争之胆，必先有正确认识，欲有认识，必从学习起。
　　吕集义
    白皮书特别提出所谓“民主个人主义”将要得到“鼓励”，我们民主阵营里头，正好趁此时机来做一种澄清的工作，整一我们的步伐，坚强我们的壁垒，帝国主义者的阴谋诡计，结果还是失败的。　（未完）
