    Facilitating Business Travel and Encouraging Material Exchange
    Organizing Joint Inspections
    Decision by the North China Tax Bureau and Relevant Authorities
    [Reported by this newspaper] To effectively implement the regulations concerning market management and material exchange issued by the North China People's Government, the North China Tax Bureau invited representatives from the Tianjin and Beijing Tax Bureaus, the Ministry of Railways, the Public Security Section of the Beijing Railway Bureau, the Garrison Headquarters Disciplinary Brigade, the Beijing Public Security Bureau, the North China Highway Bureau, the Postal Administration, the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Customs, and the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China to discuss methods for unified inspections through mutual cooperation. Li Yu'ang, Director of the North China Tax Bureau, pointed out that past coordination among the attending agencies was insufficient, leading to inconsistencies in inspection procedures in some areas. He emphasized the need for further improvement to align with the overall policy of developing production and promoting economic prosperity. He requested that all attending agencies implement policies that consider urban-rural relations in their operations, strengthen ties, assist each other to save manpower, and provide opinions on how to improve inspection efficiency and techniques. Subsequently, the representative of the unified joint inspection station at Qianmen Railway Station reported on the work summary of the unified joint inspection. He stated that since the establishment of the inspection station, merchants and travelers passing through the East Railway Station only underwent a single inspection, which not only benefited business travelers but also greatly improved efficiency compared to the past when each agency performed inspections separately. Since May, in just over fifty days, a total of 4,354 cases of various kinds were uncovered, including nine categories such as gold and silver, narcotics, scattered soldiers, special agents, bandits, and tax evasion, with tax evasion cases accounting for the vast majority. Afterwards, everyone exchanged experiences in the discussion and put forward many opinions on implementing policies. Finally, the following points were unanimously agreed upon: (1) To facilitate business travel and encourage material exchange, joint and unified inspections by relevant departments in various regions are the best approach, and the organizational methods of the joint inspection station at the Beijing East Railway Station should be widely promoted. (2) A joint conference should be organized by the relevant departments at the North China level to guide the joint inspection agencies in various regions; local areas should accept the experience of the North China level joint conference and organize local joint conferences to lead the joint inspection stations. (3) To promote joint inspection work, the North China Tax Bureau will be responsible for discussing and issuing joint instructions with relevant agencies at the North China level. In addition, specific methods for strengthening the education of inspection personnel, improving inspection techniques, increasing inspection efficiency, and closely connecting to exchange experiences in the future were also discussed and agreed upon. It is expected that this will play a significant role in facilitating transportation, business travel, and material exchange between urban and rural areas. (Wang Bin)

    便利商旅鼓励物资交流
    组织联合检查
    华北税务总局与各有关机关决定
    【本报讯】华北税务总局为了很好地执行华北人民政府所颁发的对市场管理、物资交流的几项规定，曾邀集平津两市税务局及铁道部、平津铁路局公安处北平公安段、平津卫戍司令部纠察总队、北平市公安局、华北公路总局、邮政管理局、津海关北平分关、中国人民银行北平分行等有关机关，开会讨论互相联系实行统一检查的办法。华北税务总局李予昂局长首先提出过去由于到会各机关的联系不够，所以在某些地区检查手续上未能一致，今后必须进一步改善，以符发展生产、繁荣经济的总方针，因此到会各机关在业务中，必须贯彻照顾城乡关系的政策，并加强联系、彼此协助、以求节省人力，在稽查方法上，如何提高检查工作效能和技术等三方面，请大家提供意见。继由前门车站统一联合检查站代表报告关于统一联合检查的工作总结。他说：这一检查站自成立后，客商经过东车站者仅经过一次检查，不仅商旅称便，而较之以往各机关单独执行检查，效率亦大为提高。自五月起，仅五十余日，共查获各种案件四千三百五十四件，计金银、毒品、散兵游勇、特务匪徒及漏税等九种，其中以漏税案件占绝对多数。之后，大家在讨论中，互相交流经验，提出了许多贯彻政策的意见。最后一致同意下列几点：（一）为便利商旅、鼓励物资交流，各地区有关部门之检查工作，以联合统一执行为最好，并应将北平东车站之联合检查站的组织办法普遍推广。（二）由华北级各有关部门组织联席会议，指导各地联合检查机构；各地应接受华北级联席会议经验，组织地方联席会议，领导联合检查站。（三）为推动联合检查工作，由华北税务总局负责，与华北级各有关机关商讨发出联合指示。此外，对如何加强稽（检）查人员的教育，及提高检查技术，增进检查效能，以及今后如何密切联系交流经验的具体办法，均有所商定。预料今后对便利运输、便利商旅、便利城乡物资交流，将发生很大作用。          （王斌）
