　　Zhangbei Market Mismanagement Restricts Grain Purchases, Hindering Production
　　Market Management Committee Has Corrected
　　[Zhangbei News] Due to less grain arriving in Zhangbei city market during the rainy season, the market management committee, fearing that small noodle shops would be unable to buy grain and production would be affected, organized 112 noodle shops (mills) into six groups. These groups were to purchase grain in rotation, with only two groups allowed to buy each day, and only with a slip approved by the market management committee. This restriction resulted in some noodle shops not having money on their designated purchasing day, and being unable to buy grain even when they had money, leading to the shutdown of more than 20 noodle shops and hindering production. On the 4th of this month, the market management committee decided to abolish this simple administrative order that restricted free trade. Now, each household can purchase grain and resume production, which has been very well received by both noodle shops and grain merchants.

　　张北市场管理不当限购粮食妨害生产
  　市场管委会已纠正
    【张北讯】张北城内市场，因雨季来粮较少，恐怕小面铺买不到粮食影响生产，便将一百一十二户面铺（磨坊）组织起来划分六个小组，轮流购粮，一天只准两个组买，还得由市场管委会批条子才准买。这样一限制，结果有些面铺，应该他买的那天，他不一定有钱，有钱的时候又不准他买，结果更买不到粮食，使二十多家面铺因此停磨，妨害生产。本月四日市场管理委员会决定取消这种单纯行政命令，限制自由买卖的坏办法，现各户都能购到粮食进行生产，面铺粮贩反应都很好。
