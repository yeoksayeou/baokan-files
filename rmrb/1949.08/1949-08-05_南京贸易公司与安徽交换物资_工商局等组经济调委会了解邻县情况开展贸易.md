    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Nanjing is actively connecting urban and rural trade relations with neighboring counties. The purchasing team sent by the city's Trading Company assisted Quanjiao County, north of Nanjing, in establishing an urban cooperative, and exchanged a batch of cloth for more than 19,000 jin of rice from this cooperative. The city's Trading Company also exchanged daily necessities such as towels and soap for 5,000 jin of rice from Dangtu County, Anhui. After the Commissioner's Office of Suxian Prefecture in northern Anhui sent personnel to Nanjing to discuss the exchange of industrial and agricultural products with the Trading Company, the first batch of 800 shi of soybeans and 400,000 jin of edible salt arrived in Nanjing on July 26, which will be exchanged for cotton gins, cotton carding machines and other agricultural production tools, as well as matches, cloth, and the like. In order to strengthen the material exchange with neighboring counties, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government recently convened the Industry and Commerce Bureau, the Central Research Institute, the Central University, the Xinhua Daily and other twelve organizations to form the Nanjing Urban-Rural Economic Investigation Committee, which is divided into three groups: industry, agriculture, and commerce. At the end of July, they began to investigate the situation of urban-rural material exchange, the production of small-scale industry, handicrafts and agricultural by-products, and the burden on farmers in the city and Jiangning, Jiangpu, Liuhe and other counties. The Nanjing Student Union has decided to mobilize 200 students remaining on campus during the summer vacation to participate in this investigation.
