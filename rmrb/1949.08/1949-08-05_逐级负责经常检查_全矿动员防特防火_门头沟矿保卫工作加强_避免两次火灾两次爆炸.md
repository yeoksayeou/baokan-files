    Responsibility at Each Level, Frequent Inspections
    Mine-Wide Mobilization for Anti-Espionage and Fire Prevention
    Strengthen Safety and Security Work at Mentougou Mine
    Avoid a Repeat of Two Fires and Two Explosions
    [This News Report] After a series of fire incidents occurred in late June and early July, the Mentougou Coal Mine Company heightened its vigilance and practically strengthened the safety and security of the mine. On the mine administration side, a system of responsibility at each level has been established. The directors and section chiefs of each unit guarantee that no mistakes occur in their respective departments. The workers of each department also guarantee the safety of their machines and workplaces, making clear handovers during shifts, and conducting regular inspections. Recently, a thorough inspection of machines and warehouses was carried out, No. 1 furnace was cleaned, 32 dry gas pipes were repaired, and four water pipes were replaced. No. 3 furnace is currently being inspected and repaired. The main oil switch of the 425-horsepower electric winch was also repaired. The air compressor ventilation pipe, which was blocked by oily substances, has been repaired. During the inspection of the motors, it was found that the speedometer and fuse of No. 2 machine were失效 due to changes in oil quality, and these have now been repaired. During the inspection of the warehouse, valuable equipment, explosives, and detonators were moved to safe locations.

    In order to protect the safety of the machine rooms, the surrounding walls of the machine room on the mountain have been completed, and the construction of the surrounding walls of the machine room at the foot of the mountain has begun. Fifty-five households near the machine room, boiler room, and motor room at the foot of the mountain have been relocated, and barbed wire fences have been erected around them. Sixteen merchants within the mine have also been moved outside the mine.

    In order to enable the mine security team to learn firefighting skills, general fire safety education was conducted, followed by nearly ten days of firefighting drills. The team members carefully understood the terrain and water sources of the entire mine, and drew a map of the entire mine, detailing the distribution of water sources, in order to avoid panic in the event of a fire. Specific tasks were assigned to personnel, with specific individuals responsible for the safekeeping and preparation of firefighting equipment such as water hoses, water carts, ladders, and axes, as well as tasks such as going to the roof, rescuing materials, and maintaining security. At the same time, patrols are conducted every night to prevent accidents.

    The Mentougou mining area is large, and the mine security team is small and not enough to be spread around. The workers have organized a security team, with members from each production unit, shift, and team, to assist the mine security team in night patrols, fire prevention, anti-espionage, and theft prevention. They do not stop even on windy and rainy nights. On July 26th, they extinguished two fires in a row: one was caused by a short circuit in the wires, and the other was caused by the stove fire being too strong late at night, igniting the shoes and cloth drying on the stove platform. During their night patrols, the security team often adds coal and seals off burning stoves, and turns off carbide lamps. Their spirit of service has won unanimous praise. They are now preparing to study knowledge of fire prevention, anti-theft, and anti-espionage in order to take the future security work to the next level.

    The workers of each work unit have also discussed methods of fire prevention and mine protection. The workers of the power plant, boiler room, and machine room realize that these three places are the most important in the entire mine. If something goes wrong, the production of the entire mine will be greatly affected. Therefore, they all guarantee to regularly inspect and clean the machines, and to clean up the messy things nearby to avoid causing a fire. The carpenters even proposed to pay special attention to the wires, repair doors and windows, strictly prohibit throwing cigarette butts, and sweep up shavings and sawdust after work and carry them out to prevent fire.

    The workers in the mine are particularly mindful of saboteurs using detonators and explosives for sabotage. Li Gong, Zhang Wuzi, discovered a detonator placed on a water gate on July 8th. On June 30th, Yang Zhisheng, a worker in Production Team 16, discovered two detonators connected together and placed on the iron plate of the cage shaft. These two incidents did not cause any accidents because they were discovered early. Zhang Zhigang and other workers in Group 7 found 194 detonators and half a yellow explosive in the mess kit and in the bedding of Zhang Ziyun, a worker in the same group.

    Now, the workers realize that the mine is their own home, and they are uniting and raising vigilance to protect their own home.

    门头沟矿保卫工作加强 
    避免两次火灾两次爆炸
    【本报讯】门头沟煤矿公司在六月底和七月初连续发生几次失火事件后，提高了警惕，切实保卫矿厂的安全。在矿行政方面，建立起了逐级负责制度，各单位的主任股长，保证他那一部门不出错，各部门工人也保证他的机器、活地的安全，在上下班的时候，交代清楚，在平常经常检查。最近对机器和仓库都作了周密的检查，洗刷了一号炉，修理干气管子三十二根，换水管四根；三号炉正检查修理；又修理了四二五马力电高车总油开关；空气压缩机通风管被油质堵塞，已修好。在检查电机时，发现二号机的速度表及保险器因油质变化而失效，现已修好。检查仓库时已将贵重器材及火药雷管移至安全地方。
    为了保护机器房的安全，山上机器房的围墙已筑妥，山下机器房的围墙已动工，山下机器房、锅炉房、电机房附近的五十五户住家户，都已搬走，周围架设了铁丝网，矿内的商贩十六户，也搬出矿外。
    为使矿卫队学会救火工作，普遍进行了消防教育，又作了将近十天的救火演习，全队队员把全矿的地势水源都作了仔细的了解，又画了一张全矿的地图，详细的记载了水源的分布状况，以免发生火警时临时仓惶。在人员方面也作了具体的分工，消防器材如水龙、水车、梯子、斧子等的保管准备以及上房、抢救物资、警戒等工作，都有专人负责，同时在每夜巡逻，以防意外。
    门矿地区很大，矿卫队人少，不够分配，工人们又组织了保卫队，每一个生产单位，每一班、组都有人参加，协助矿卫队夜间巡逻，防火、防特、防盗。在大风大雨的夜里，也不停止。七月二十六日一连扑灭了两次火：一次是电线走火，一次是夜深的时候灶火太旺，把炉台上烘着的鞋子、布引着的。保卫队在夜间巡逻时已经常把烧旺了的炉子填煤封好，把电石灯吹灭，他们这种服务精神，获得一致好评，现在准备学习防火防盗防特的知识，以便把今后的保卫工作，提高一步。
    各工作单位的工友们，也讨论了防火护矿的办法，发电所、锅炉房、机器房的工友都认识到这三处是全矿最重要的地方，假如出了错，全矿生产就受很大的影响，所以都保证经常检查、清洁机器，还要把附近乱七八糟的东西都清理干净，以免引起火灾。木匠房的工友更提出要特别经心电线，修理门窗，严禁乱抛烟头，下班后把刨花锯末扫干净，抬出去以防引火。
    井下的工友们，特别留心破坏分子用雷管炸药来破坏，里工张五子，七月八号曾发现一个雷管放在水闸门上；生产十六组工友杨之声在六月三十号发现有两个雷管连起来，放在罐道的铁板上，这两次因发觉得早，没有出事。第七组工友张志刚等在锅伙里，在同组工人张子云的被褥里查获一百九十四个雷管，一个半黄药。
    现在，工友们都认识到矿就是自己的家，都团结起来，提高警惕，来保卫自己的家了。
