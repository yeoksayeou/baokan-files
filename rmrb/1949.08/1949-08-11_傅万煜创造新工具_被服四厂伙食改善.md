    Fu Wanyu Creates New Tool
    Food Improved at Fourth Garment Factory
    ▲ Fu Wanyu, a lathe operator at the Sixth Institute of the 70th Ordnance Factory, took on the job of making three-jaw chucks after the institute changed careers. Using the old method, he could only make one every hour and a half. After painstaking research, he created a new tool that was successfully tested on August 3rd. Now he can make six per hour. Not only is work efficiency improved, but the spun finished products are of accurate specifications and the operation is simple, saving a lot of time, machinery, and electricity. (Tang Zhixue)
    ▲ The amateur school of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has been in session for three weeks, and the workers are very enthusiastic about learning and progressing very quickly. A testing system has also been established, with a test after each course is completed. The first test was on the history of social development, and the results were very good. The amateur school has also published a wall newspaper and has extracurricular activities such as Yangko dance, singing, and a basketball team. (Cai Yanbo)
    ▲ The food for the workers at the Fourth Garment Factory used to be one jin of noodles per meal, without any vegetables. The workers raised opinions on improving the food. The union director, administration, worker representatives, and food committee members convened a food preparation meeting on July 30th. At the meeting, many workers offered opinions: "We used to eat one jin of noodles per meal, and most people couldn't finish it, which was a waste. In the future, it can be changed to ten taels per meal, and vegetable soup should be added." After agreement from all the workers, it was decided to have ten taels of noodles and twenty yuan of vegetable money per person per meal every day, starting from August 2nd. The workers said, "Before, we took a one-jin noodle bun and went to the street to buy vegetables to eat. The bun couldn't be finished and was wasted. Buying vegetables cost fifty, sixty, or even one hundred yuan, and we didn't even dare to buy good vegetables. Now, ten taels of noodles per meal is about the same amount, and we only spend twenty yuan on vegetables per person, and we can eat heartily."

    傅万煜创造新工具
    被服四厂伙食改善
    ▲七十兵工厂第六所车工傅万煜，自该所转业后，他担任作三爪卡盘，用以前的老方法，每一小时半才能作一个，经过他苦心的研究，创制了一种新工具，于八月三日开始试用成功，每小时能作六个。不独工作效率提高，并且旋出的成品规格严准，操作简单，对时间、机器、用电都节省很多。      （唐志学）
    ▲石景山钢铁厂业余学校，开课三周来，职工们学习情绪很高，进度非常快，并且建立了测验制度，每一门课告一段落后测验一次，第一次测验社会发展史，成绩都很好。业余学校又出刊了壁报，在课外有秧歌、歌咏、篮球队等。
        （蔡彦博）
    ▲被服四厂工友的伙食，以前一顿吃一斤面，而且还没有菜，工友们提出了改善伙食的意见。工会主任、行政、工友代表、伙食委员便于七月三十日召开一个伙食筹备会，在会上有许多工友提出意见：“我们以前一顿吃一斤面，有大多数人吃不了，都糟踏了。以后可改为每顿十两，还要添上菜汤”。后经各个工友同意，每天每顿每人十两面，二十元菜金。从八月二日起开始实行了。工友们说：“那时候拿一斤面的窝头，走到街上去买菜吃，窝头吃不了都糟踏了，买菜吃还不敢吃好菜就得五六十元、一百元，现在一顿十两面都差不了多少，一人只花二十元钱的菜金，吃的痛痛快快的。”
