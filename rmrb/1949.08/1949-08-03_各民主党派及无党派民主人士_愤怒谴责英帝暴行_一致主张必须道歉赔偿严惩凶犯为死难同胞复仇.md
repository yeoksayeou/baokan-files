[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The news of the HMS Amethyst's shameless escape has aroused the greatest anger among the people. Democratic parties, non-party democratic figures, writers, and social scientists in Beiping have unanimously expressed their protest and condemned the crimes of British imperialism, demanding severe punishment for the culprits, apologies, and reparations. The following are the statements from Li Jishen of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Shen Junru and Zhang Bojun of the China Democratic League, Huang Yanpei of the China Democratic National Construction Association, non-party democrat Guo Moruo, Ma Xulun of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, writer Mao Dun, social scientist Li Da, and others:

Li Jishen said: British Imperialism is Cunning, Shameless, and Takes Pirate-Like Actions

The "Amethyst" incident makes us see even more clearly the brutality, cunning, and shamelessness of imperialism. Imperialists are gleefully celebrating "bravery, skill, and determination," but in the eyes of informed people around the world, this is entirely a "piratical" act. The Chinese people will certainly not forgive this act of violence by British imperialism, and we must investigate the responsibility for the "Amethyst" incident.

Shen Junru said: This Debt Must Be Remembered, Atrocities Must Be Punished

I am extremely indignant at the perfidious and despicable behavior of British imperialism, but on the other hand, it also exposes the cowardice, incompetence, and outward strength but inner weakness of British imperialism. We must remember this debt, and the government of the People's Republic of China must demand an apology from British imperialism in the future, and compensate for all the losses suffered by our military and civilians due to the unreasonable intrusion of British warships into the Yangtze River. In particular, the "Amethyst" also opened fire and sank our merchant ships while fleeing in a hurry, drowning our people. Such atrocities must be punished.

Zhang Bojun said: The Fierce Face of British Imperialism is Even More Fully Exposed

This barbaric and illegal behavior of British imperialism will surely arouse the resentment of all Chinese people, and even the resentment of the people of the world. As the Chinese people settle accounts for the crimes of British imperialism in China over the past century, this shameless retaliatory behavior further exposes the fierce face of British imperialism. We must strengthen our unity and, under the strong leadership of the Communist Party, quickly and completely eliminate the aggressive forces of imperialism in China.

Huang Yanpei said: The People of the Whole Country Remember to Make British Imperialism Pay the Blood Debt

The British warship "Amethyst" invaded our inland river, the Yangtze River, within our army's defense line on April 20, 1949, and bombarded our army's positions. It was captured by our army. While negotiations were underway, demanding an apology and compensation from the other side, the ship suddenly escaped on the night of July 30. While escaping, it sank our merchant ship "Jiangling Liberation" and many lifeboats, killing and drowning hundreds of passengers. It committed heinous crimes twice, before and after.

The people of the whole country of China understand that if we want to recognize the ferocity and brutality of imperialism, this is a part of all their ferocious and brutal actions before and after. If we want to recognize the shamelessness of imperialism, this is a natural exposure of their shameless behavior.

The people of the whole country of China remember that we must settle this account with them, demand a serious apology, double the compensation, and avenge our compatriots who were sacrificed before and after, if there is still a British government.

Guo Moruo said: British Imperialism Should Not Be Happy Too Soon, Crimes Will Never Be Forgiven

This is completely a heinous pirate act! The pirate chiefs of British imperialism should not be happy too soon, the Chinese people will never forget the two days of "April 20" and "July 30"! We must avenge the compatriots who were killed on the "Jiangling Liberation"! No matter where the "Amethyst" escapes to, as long as your British imperialist government exists for one day, we Chinese people will never easily forgive you!

Ma Xulun said: We Warn the Pirates to Avenge the Dead

The British warship "Amethyst" was helping the Kuomintang reactionaries fight against the Chinese people. They bombarded us first, so of course we have the right to detain them and punish them. Today, not only do they not admit their mistakes, but they also attack our people and become enemies of the people of the whole country. This pirate behavior cannot be concealed from the eyes of the people of the world. From any point of view, it is the most shameful. Today, we must investigate the responsibility, and we must prepare the power of the people to deal with this crime of imperialism. We must loudly warn the imperialists that the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party, will never forget this tragic incident and avenge the dead compatriots!

Mao Dun said: Pirates are Lawless and Will Be Held Accountable

This is utter piracy. It is indeed very "glorious" for British imperialists to use this kind of piracy to "preserve" their "face". The Chinese people will forever remember this lawless crime of British imperialism in our territory and will hold them accountable.

Li Da said: Criminals Who Commit Murder and Escape Should Be Punished More Severely

British imperialists originally started out as pirates. Their history is originally a bloody and criminal history of pirates killing, looting, and committing crimes along the coast. For more than a hundred years, they have consistently committed crimes of murder and robbery in various parts of China, and have never been properly punished. This time, this pirate was actually captured by the People's Liberation Army of the People's China. They were criminals who committed murder on the spot and were arrested on the spot. Criminals should be punished as they deserve. Unexpectedly, they bombarded our "Jiangling Liberation" and escaped after committing murder. This precisely shows the ferocious, hideous, criminal, and shameless nature of pirates. The British "Emperor" and "Prime Minister" actually celebrated the "Amethyst's" heroic escape after committing murder, which precisely shows the true face of pirate leaders, which is not surprising. But our 475 million people are determined to retaliate for the compatriots who sacrificed on April 20 and July 30. Criminals who commit murder and escape not only cannot be exempt from punishment, but should be punished more severely. We believe that all the people of China will be able to avenge this deep blood feud.

    各民主党派及无党派民主人士
    愤怒谴责英帝暴行
    一致主张必须道歉赔偿严惩凶犯为死难同胞复仇
    【本报专访】紫石英号无耻逃跑的消息传出后，激起了人民最大的愤怒，在平各民主党派及无党派民主人士、作家、社会科学家一致表示抗议，谴责英帝罪行，要求严惩祸首，道歉赔偿，现先将中国国民党革命委员会李济深，中国民主同盟沈钧儒、章伯钧，民主建国会黄炎培，无党派民主人士郭沫若，中国民主促进会马叙伦，文学家茅盾，社会科学家李达等谈话发表如下：
    李济深说：英帝狡诈无耻采海盗式行为
    从“紫石英”号逃脱事件，使我们更加清楚地看见帝国主义的残暴、狡诈与无耻，帝国主义者很得意地在祝贺“勇敢、巧妙和决心”，但在全世界有识之士的眼光看起来，这完全是“海盗”式的行为。我们中国人民对于英帝这种暴行一定不会宽恕，我们一定要追究“紫石英”号事件的责任。
    沈钧儒说：这笔帐记下来暴行必须惩罚
    我对英帝国主义这种不顾信义卑鄙无耻的行为非常愤慨，但另一方面也正暴露了英帝国主义的懦怯无能和外强中干。我们一定把这笔帐记下来，日后中华人民民主共和国政府一定要向英帝国主义要求道歉，并赔偿因英国军舰无理闯入长江而使我国军民遭受的一切损失。尤其是这次“紫石英”号仓惶逃跑时，还开炮击沉我们的商船，溺毙我国人民，这种暴行是非惩罚不可的。
    章伯钧说：英帝凶恶面貌更加完全暴露
    英帝国主义这种野蛮不法行为，一定会激起全中国人民的愤恨；以至于全世界人民的愤恨。英帝国主义在中国一百年来的罪恶，在被中国人民清算的时候，这种无耻的反噬行为，更加暴露了英帝国主义凶恶面貌，我们一定要加紧团结，在共产党的坚强领导下，迅速把帝国主义者在华的侵略的力量完全消灭。
    黄炎培说：全国国民记着要英帝偿血债
    英舰“紫石英”号一九四九年四月二十日侵入我国内河长江我军防线，炮轰我军阵地，被我俘获，正在向对方谈判，要求道歉并赔偿时，该舰突于七月三十日夜逃跑，在逃跑时，击沉我国商船江陵解放号，又击沉许多救生的木船，击死淹死几百名乘客，前后两次犯了弥天的罪恶。
    我中国全国国民懂得，我们如要认识帝国主义的凶狠残暴，这就是他们前前后后凶狠残暴全部行为中的一部表现，我们如要认识帝国主义的无耻，这就是他们无耻行径的自然暴露。
    我中国全国国民记着，我们必须向他们算这笔帐，要求严重的道歉，加倍的赔偿，替我前后被牺牲的同胞复仇，如果还有英国政府的话。
    郭沫若说：英帝且慢高兴罪恶绝不饶恕
    这完全是穷凶极恶的海盗行径！英帝国主义的海盗头子们且慢高兴，中国人民是绝对不会忘记“四月二十”和“七月三十”这两个日子的！我们一定要为江陵解放号遭难的同胞们报仇！任你“紫石英”号逃到天涯海角，只要你英帝国主义政府还存在一天，我们中国人民是绝对不轻易饶恕的！
    马叙伦说：我们警告海盗为死难者复仇
    英舰“紫石英”号是帮助国民党反动派对抗中国人民的，他们先炮击我们，我们当然有权力要把他扣起来，而且处罚他们。今天，他不但不承认错，反击伤我人民，和我全国人民为敌，这种海盗行为，瞒不过世界人民的眼睛，无论从哪方面看，都是最可耻的。今天我们一定要追究责任，我们要准备人民的力量来对付这一帝国主义的罪行。我们要大声的警告帝国主义者，我们全国人民在共产党领导下，将永不忘记这一惨痛事件，为死难的同胞复仇！
    茅盾说：海盗无法无天必将追究责任
    这是十足的海盗行为。英帝国主义者用这种海盗行为来“保全”它的“颜面”，确是“光荣”得很。中国人民将永远记住英帝国主义在我国领土内此种无法无天的罪行，并将追究责任。
    李达说：罪犯行凶脱逃应当加重处罚
    英帝国主义者，原是做海盗起家的，它的历史，原是海盗在沿海各地杀人越货的血腥的罪恶的历史。百余年来，它在中国各地一贯的做着杀人越货的勾当，一向未曾受到应有的惩罚。此次这个海盗竟被人民的中国的人民解放军捕获了。它是当场行凶当场被捕的罪犯。罪犯是应当受应受的惩罚的，不料它竟然炮轰我江陵解放号，行凶脱逃，这正表现了海盗的凶恶狰狞的罪恶和无耻。英国“天皇”和“首相”居然庆祝“紫石英”号行凶脱逃的英勇，这正表现着海盗头领的本来面目，原非奇事。但我四亿七千五百万人民，誓必为四月二十日和七月三十日牺牲的同胞而实行报复。罪犯行凶脱逃，不但不能免于惩罚，而且应当加重受惩罚。我们相信，我们全中国的人民，必能报复这一血海的深仇。
