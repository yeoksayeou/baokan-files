    Beiping General Machinery Factory Prepares to Establish General Trade Union
    [This Municipality News] The Beiping General Machinery Factory and its three affiliated branches do not yet have a unified leading body in terms of trade union organization. Recently, leading comrades from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' industrial trade unions and the trade unions of various factories within the machinery factory, in order to enable workers to better study and participate in factory management, are preparing to establish a General Trade Union of the machinery factory. The industrial trade union convened a meeting of trade union cadres from various branches of the machinery factory on the 4th, deciding that a temporary working group composed of trade union cadres from each factory should, over a period of three weeks, lead and assist the trade unions of each factory in publicizing the significance of establishing a General Trade Union, solicit workers' opinions on the trade union, launch a democratic movement, elect worker representatives, and then establish the General Trade Union. The preparatory work has already commenced on the 4th. (Nian Gao)

    北平机器总厂筹组总职工会
    【本市讯】北平机器总厂及所属三个分厂，在职工会的组织上，还没有一个统一的领导机构。最近市总工会产业工会和机器厂各厂的工会负责同志，为了使职工们能更好的学习，参加工厂管理，特筹备成立机器厂总职工会。产业工会在四日召集机器厂各分厂工会干部会议，决定由各厂工会干部组成临时工作小组，用三个星期的时间，领导并协助各厂职工会，宣传成立总职工会的意义，征求工人对工会的意见，开展民主运动，选出职工代表，然后成立总职工会。现筹备工作，已自四日开始进行。            （念高）
