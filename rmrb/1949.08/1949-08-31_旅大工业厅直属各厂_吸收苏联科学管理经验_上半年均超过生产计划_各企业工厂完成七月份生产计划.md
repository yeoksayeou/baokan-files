Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, August 30th: The twenty-two factories directly under the Lüda Administrative Office Industrial Bureau overfulfilled their production plans by an average of 6.03% in the first half of this year, exceeding the total production value of the first half of last year by 197.55%. The reason for achieving the above results is mainly due to the absorption of the Soviet Union's advanced scientific production management experience and the implementation of planned costs, which gave workers a clear goal in completing production tasks. In formulating planned costs, each factory distributed the production plan to each workshop, group, and even each worker, mobilizing workers to study and discuss it so that they could understand their production tasks. The Jinzhou Textile Factory and Guangyuan Oil Factory prepare a comparison table of planned output and actual output every day, so workers know the extent to which they complete their tasks every day, which promotes production. Secondly, since March of this year, each factory has adjusted the past unreasonable organizational structure, implemented a clear division of labor and responsibility system, and improved production efficiency. The Dalian Textile Factory required more than sixteen man-hours (calculated at eight hours per day) to spin one piece of yarn in January, but this has been reduced to less than twelve man-hours by June. Thirdly, the establishment and improvement of inspection and other systems has further guaranteed the completion of production tasks and the scientific management.

In addition: Enterprises and factories in the Lüda area have completed their production plans for the first month of the third quarter of this year on schedule, and some have even exceeded the plan. All factories under the Dalian Ship Repair and Shipbuilding Factory have completed their July production plans, and the Forging Factory completed its annual task of manufacturing new ship parts on the morning of August 6th. This year's plan for manufacturing new ship parts for the factory is one-third higher than last year, but the completion time is two months earlier than last year, and the quality has also been improved. The Transportation Department of the Dalian Locomotive Section of the China Changchun Railway originally planned to haul 81,000 tons in July, but actually completed 94,134 tons, exceeding by 16%. The bulb and glass factories under the Far East Electric Power Company also largely exceeded or completed their July production plans. Workers in the bulb factory sit by gas fires and large kilns every day in the sweltering heat, exceeding the original plan by more than 44%, more than doubling the output in the same period last year. The production of electric motors in the Electric Motor Factory also exceeded the original plan by 25%. Other factories such as brick, tile, glass, and oil factories have also completed their tasks.

　　旅大工业厅直属各厂
  　吸收苏联科学管理经验
    上半年均超过生产计划
    各企业工厂完成七月份生产计划
    【新华社大连三十日电】旅大行政公署工业厅直属的二十二个工厂，今年上半年平均超过了生产计划百分之六点零三；超过去年上半年生产总价值的百分之一百九十七点五五。获得上述成绩的原因，主要是由于吸收苏联先进的科学的生产管理经验，实行了计划成本，使工人在完成生产任务中有了明确的目标。在制订计划成本中，各厂都将生产计划发到每个车间、小组以至每个工人，发动工人研究和讨论，使他们了解自己的生产任务。金州纺织厂、广源制油厂每天制有计划产量和实际产量的对比表，工人们因而知道每天完成任务的程度，对生产起了督促作用。其次是各厂自今年三月份起调整了过去不合理的组织机构，实行明确分工的负责制，提高了生产效率。大连纺织工厂一月份纺一件纱需要十六个以上人工（按每日八小时计算），至六月份已减至不到十二个人工。再次是建立和健全了检查等各种制度，使生产任务的完成和管理的科学化更有了保证。
    又讯：旅大地区各企业工厂今年第三季第一个月的生产计划已按时完成，有的还超过计划。大连修船造船厂所属各厂，均已完成了七月份生产计划，其中锻工厂并在八月六日上午完成了全年制造新船零件的任务。该厂今年制造新船零件的计划比去年高三分之一，而在完成时间上却比去年提前两个月，质量也较前提高。中长路大连机务段运转部，七月份原定计划牵引量是八万一千吨，但实际完成了九万四千一百三十四吨，超过百分之十六。远东电业公司所属灯泡、玻璃等厂，亦大部超过或完成七月份生产计划。灯泡工厂工人在酷暑中，每天坐在瓦斯火旁及大窑上工作，超过了原计划的百分之四十四强，较去年同时期产量超过一倍。电机工厂电动机生产量亦超过原计划的百分之二十五。其他如砖瓦、玻璃、制油等工厂亦已完成了任务。
