    My Transformation
    Female Worker, Da Xing Cotton Mill, Wang Lanzhu

    When I was ten years old, I was forced by life to start working at Da Xing. Some people say: "Workers are no good, lazy, greedy, and uneducated." At that time, I also thought: what is the point of being a worker? It's not as good as being rich; sitting and eating, sitting and drinking, and sometimes going to the theater to listen to plays, how wonderful! I never thought about where their money came from. In those days, I was often beaten by the Japanese devils at work. After being beaten, I thought to myself that it was right to be beaten by them, who told me to eat their food? I never thought that we were feeding them with our blood and sweat.
    After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, the Communist Party said: "Workers are the proletariat, the most glorious class, and society cannot do without workers." At that time, I was very suspicious in my heart. How could the Communist Party say such a thing! It can't be true, right? Later, I personally experienced that the Communist Party respects us workers everywhere, and thinks of workers everywhere. From then on, I realized that the Communist Party is our workers' party. In addition, when the factory established a workers' literacy class, they asked me to attend. Not only did I not go, but I also said to others: "We're so old, can we still learn to write?" Later, I saw that other comrades were going to class and they had all learned to write, so I also wanted to go and found a partner in the spinning room to go to class together.
    At first, I felt a headache taking political classes. Later, after reluctantly listening to a few classes, I loved listening more and more, and I also attended more meetings. Gradually, I also learned to write. I also told other female workers: "Let's all go to class, it's so good to learn to read! In the old society, we didn't have money, so we couldn't go to school and learn to read. Now that the Communist Party has come, it not only tells us to read, but also lets us know about national affairs." Later, I also joined the New Democratic Youth League. After joining the League, I had more energy in production and learning. In production, I exert as much strength as I have. I realize that the factory is my own, so I can't be lazy or take shortcuts. If I make a big mistake, the public will suffer a loss, and the cloth will not be woven well.
    In the last competition, I saw that the young workers didn't even have time to eat, so I helped them take care of the machines. When they were busy carrying yarn, I would give them numbers. My arms were sore all day, but I was very happy in my heart. In learning, if I know one word, I teach it to others, and they are very happy! Later, they knew that I was a League member, and they said that Lanzhu had joined the League and was progressing so fast! I also use various methods to help them to be more active in production and study hard. Before I joined the Party, if someone said something about me, I would argue with them. After joining the Party, it's different. No matter what they say about me, I don't argue. I wait for them to calm down and then slowly explain to them. Since I joined the League and the Party, I have never forgotten that I am a Party member. Under the leadership of the Party, I must unite everyone well to actively produce and study hard, especially in response to the call of the Municipal Party Committee to participate in this production competition, and I must take the lead in raising production by an inch.

    我的转变
    大兴纱厂女工  王兰珠
    我在十岁时候，被生活逼迫，就在大兴上了班啦。有的人说：“上工的没有好人，又懒、又好吃、又没有知识。”在那个时候我也是想：当一个工人有什么意义呢？不如人家有钱的好；坐着吃、坐着喝，有时到戏园里听听戏多么好呀！我从来没有想过他们那些钱是打那里来的，在那个时候干着活常挨日本鬼子的打，挨了打，自己还想，挨人家的打是应该的，谁叫吃着人家的呢？总没有想到这是我们用血汗喂肥了他们的。
    石家庄解放后，共产党说：“工人是无产阶级，是最光荣的阶级，社会上没有工人是不行的。”当时我听了心里很怀疑，共产党怎么这样会说呀！事实上不会这样的吧？后来我亲身体验到共产党处处尊重我们工人，处处为工人着想，从此我认识到共产党是咱们工人的党。另外，厂里成立工人识字班时，开始叫我上课，我不但不去，还说别人：“年岁这么大啦，还能学会写字吗？”后来我看到别的同志都去上课了，人家都学会了写字啦，我也想去，就找到细纱间的同伴一同上课去。
    起先上政治课感到头痛，后来勉强的听了几课后，愈听愈爱听，参加开会也多了，慢慢的也学着写字。我又告诉其他女工说：“都去上课吧，学认字多么好呀！在旧社会里我们没有钱就不能上学识字，现在共产党来了，不光叫我们认字，还叫我们知道国家大事。”后来，我又参加了新民主主义青年团，入了团，生产和学习都有劲了。在生产上我有多大力量，就使多大力量，我认识到工厂是自己的，咱不能偷懒，也不能取巧，如果接一个大疙疸，公家就受了损失，布也织不好。
    在上一次竞赛当中，我看见小工友顾不得吃饭，我就帮她们照顾车，她们忙着抱纱的时候，我就给她们划号，划一天胳膊都酸了，但是我心里却很高兴。在学习当中我会一个字就教给别人一个字，她们可高兴啦！后来知道我是一个团员，她们说兰珠入了团啦，进步这样快呀！我还用各种办法，帮助她们使她们生产积极，努力学习。我在没入党以前，别人说了我，我就跟她们吵起来了。入党后就不同了，她们怎样说我都不吵，等她们的气消了，再慢慢给她们解释。自从我入了团和党，时时刻刻都没有忘记我是一个党员，在党的领导下一定很好的团结大家在一起积极生产，努力学习，特别是响应市委号召，参加这次生产竞赛运动，并且要起带头作用，使生产提高一寸。
