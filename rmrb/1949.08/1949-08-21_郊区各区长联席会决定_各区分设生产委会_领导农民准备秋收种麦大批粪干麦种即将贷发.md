[This Municipality News] To strengthen the leadership of suburban production work, the Municipal Government's Suburban Work Committee recently held a joint meeting of district heads from various suburban districts and decided to establish production committees in each district. The committee will be jointly composed of the district government, district committee, district public security sub-bureau, district cooperative, and cooperative bank office, with the district head serving as the director. The current central task is to lead farmers in actively preparing for the autumn harvest and to mobilize the masses in various villages to adjust wheat seeds and fertilizers through mutual aid, to facilitate vigorous wheat planting after the autumn harvest.

[Further News] To assist suburban farmers in solving the problem of wheat seeds and fertilizers after the autumn, the Municipal Cooperative Bank will loan 500,000 jin of dried manure and 133,000 jin of wheat seeds, of which 33,000 jin are high-quality wheat seeds. After the harvest next year, these wheat seeds will be repurchased by the bank at a price higher than the prevailing market price, under the principle of farmers' willingness, to promote their wider use. In addition, the Municipal Cooperative has also prepared 400,000 jin of wheat seeds for suburban farmers to purchase or exchange for miscellaneous grains.
