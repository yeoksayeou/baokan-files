    [Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station, 17th Broadcast] To strengthen urban-rural mutual assistance, promote material exchange, and smash the enemy's blockade, the East China Military Region Headquarters has decided that the policy of free domestic trade should be strictly implemented from now on. Yesterday, Trade Character No. 1 Proclamation was issued, stating: Hereafter, if merchants purchase grain and raw materials from the inland, or transport goods from various cities for domestic sale, and encounter obstruction or prohibition, they may complain to the local government above the county level, or military organs above the regimental level. If they are bandits, special agents, or remnants of feudal forces, and dare to extort anonymously or blockade materials, they will be severely punished once discovered.
