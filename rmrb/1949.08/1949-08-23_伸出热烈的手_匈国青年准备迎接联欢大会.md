　　Hungarian Youth Prepare to Welcome the Joint Celebration
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Cai Jintao
    The decision by the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students to hold the World Youth and Students Festival in Budapest is an unparalleled honor for the Hungarian youth. They know that the reason for this honor is, first, thanks to the help of the Soviet Union, the Hungarian people, under the leadership of the Hungarian Workers' Party, are enjoying a life of democracy and freedom, and second, they have begun to build a state of working people.
    Hungarian youth are enthusiastically preparing to welcome their foreign guests. They are especially happy to receive representatives of the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League, hoping to learn from them. At the same time, they will also receive youth from democratic countries, as well as youth from colonial and oppressed countries who are struggling for independence and freedom against imperialism. Their current task is to do everything possible to help the international preparatory committee for the joint celebration. Fifty-four thousand Hungarian youth, divided into four large groups, participate in the joint celebration in four-day rotations. In addition, the Hungarian People's Youth League has mobilized a large number of people to participate in the celebration, including hosting foreign youth to visit the Hungarian countryside and participating in celebrations across the country on August 20th. On August 28th, 250,000 young people, including 100,000 local youth, will hold a large peace demonstration and parade in the streets of Budapest.
    In order to participate in the joint celebration, Hungarian youth have launched a production competition and encouraged young people with excellent work performance to participate in the joint celebration. The "Youth Workers' League" team of the Kenz Locomotive Iron Factory, one of the largest heavy industrial factories in Budapest, issued a call to youth worker organizations across the country to increase production.
    Factories across the country participating in the production competition initiated by the Kenz Locomotive Iron Factory have undertaken a large amount of work. For example, the Kenz Electric Factory contributed 3,500 hours of work, worth one million forints. The youth work team launched a blitz movement. At the Gyor Locomotive Factory, nine new youth work teams were established. The Kispest textile factory formed two youth work teams that competed with each other: the Communist Youth Team and the Stakhanov Youth Team. One of the youth work teams at the Salgótarján steel plant even automatically took on the task of increasing production by 116% to 130%. Many young workers individually participated in the competition and increased production. For example, young worker Gabler increased production by 135% to 140%; László Kraki, the team leader, increased production by 120% to 130%. Within a few days, production meetings were held in more than 300 factories to decide to join the production movement initiated by the Kenz Locomotive Factory.
    Youth in the countryside also participated in the production movement. They organized harvest teams, threshing teams, weeding and plowing teams, and various other production tasks. As a result of these collective efforts, both quality and quantity have improved. For example, the youth organization in Nógrádcsorna organized a threshing team, and their characteristic was to have 39 members of the United Youth Farmers' Association guard the fields. In Gyömrőspusztá, the youth farmer work team was the first to complete the threshing work. Encouraged by the joint celebration, countless organizations decided to mobilize members to strengthen the cooperative movement. In Somogyszob, 120 cooperative members were recruited.
    In addition to the production movement, young people have set up various study groups to learn about materials related to the joint celebration. One hundred thousand young people joined five-day study groups, which was one of the conditions for their participation in the celebration. The study groups focused on understanding the importance of the celebration, how the World Federation of Democratic Youth fights for peace, why the joint celebration is being held in Hungary, and how Hungarian youth should accept this honor. On July 11th alone, study groups for 15,000 people began in 600 regions. In addition, Hungarian youth used various methods to maintain contact with member groups of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the preparatory committees of various joint celebrations. Hungarian radio broadcasts and newspapers regularly broadcast news of world youth activities. Most youth publications published these messages. Throughout Hungary, young people can be seen practicing songs and dances for the joint celebration. Almost every young person wants to learn a few foreign language phrases in order to greet the delegations in their native languages.
    Youth from more than 30 factories in Budapest are working to contact their worker comrades in foreign countries. Members of the "Youth Workers' League" of the Csepel Refinery are in contact with the Communist Youth League in Baku. Youth workers at the Kenz Locomotive Factory are in contact with youth workers in Magnitogorsk (Soviet Union); youth workers at the Mávag textile factory are in contact with youth in Škoda; youth workers at the Kispest textile factory are in contact with youth workers in Łódź (Poland). The youth of the small town of Törtel, with only a few hundred residents, are in contact with the youth of Cuba. The young farmers of Törtel have prepared embroidered silk scarves to give to their young Cuban friends.
    Speaking of gifts, it's not just in Törtel, but all over the country. Hungarian youth are secretly preparing gifts to give people a surprise and joy when the time comes. A few that have already been revealed are: the Hofherr factory prepared delicate small tractors, and the Salgótarján steel plant prepared one hundred gifts. The youth of Gallyagapati prepared small knife boxes, carved walking sticks, embroidered leather whips, and doves symbolizing peace.
    Hungarian youth are enthusiastically raising funds for the youth representatives of colonial countries. Even some small towns are holding charity sales of joint celebration commemorative stamps or offering to accommodate a young person from each colonial country.
    Three hundred cultural teams participated in the selection for the cultural competition, and thirty of them were concentrated in cultural camps for training to serve as hosts and guides at the celebration. Hundreds of cultural work teams went to the countryside to help young farmers understand the significance of the celebration. As for sports: 102,000 young people participated in the "Prepare for Work and Combat" movement in a few weeks. Preparing for collective sports, especially volleyball, at least 3,200 volleyball teams have already been formed.
    Learning is not lagging behind either. Two-thirds of the various vocational classes for young people (remedial classes for young workers and peasants preparing to enter university) planned to be completed by autumn have already begun. Most of them are young workers from large industrial factories.
    Hungarian youth warmly welcome the Communist Youth League. Girls placed bouquets on the monuments to the heroic Red Army soldiers who sacrificed their lives in various places. Komsomol corners were set up in various agencies, hanging portraits of Comrade Stalin and photos of young guards such as Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya and Alexander Matrosov.
    Hungarian youth know that participating in and helping the joint celebration is equivalent to increasing the strength of the anti-imperialist struggle and the international peace camp.

　　伸出热烈的手
  　匈国青年准备迎接联欢大会
    蔡锦涛
    世界民主青年联盟和国际学生联合会联合决定在布达佩斯举行世界民主青年和学生联欢大会，这是匈牙利青年们感到无上的荣誉。他们知道所以有这个荣誉，第一，由于苏联的帮助，在匈工人党领导下，匈牙利人民已享受着民主自由的生活，第二，他们已经开始建设劳动人民的国家了。
    匈牙利青年正热烈的准备来迎接他们的外国宾客。他们特别感觉快乐的是接待苏联列宁共产主义青年团的代表，希望向他们学习，同时，他们也一样接待各民主国家的青年，为独立自由而与帝国主义的斗争的殖民地与被压迫国家的青年。他们当前的工作是尽一切努力为联欢大会的国际筹备委员会帮忙。五万四千个匈牙利青年，分成四个大组，每四天轮流参加联欢大会，此外，匈牙利人民青年联合会还动员了大批群众参加庆祝大会，参加招待八月二十日外国青年们参观匈乡村和在全国各地的庆祝会。八月二十八日，二十五万青年，其中十万是当地青年，将在布达佩斯街道举行和平大示威游行。
    为了参加联欢大会，匈牙利青年发起了生产竞赛，并且鼓励工作成绩优良的青年参加联欢大会。肯兹机车铁工厂，布达佩斯重工业工厂最大之一的“青年工人联盟”队曾向全国工人青年各组织发出提高生产的号召。
    参加肯兹机车铁工厂发起的生产竞赛的各地工厂，都担负起了大量的工作。如肯兹电力工厂贡献出了三千五百小时，价值一百万弗罗令的工作。青年工作队发起了一个突击运动。在其奥而机车工厂，九个新的青年工作队成立了。基斯佩斯的纺织厂组成了互相竞赛的两个青年工作队：共产主义青年队和斯达哈诺夫青年队。萨而各太若的钢铁厂的青年工作队的其中一个竟自动担负起了增加百分之一百十六到百分之一百三十的生产量。很多青年工人，个别参加竞赛，增加生产，例如青年工人高勃勒，提高生产量百分之一百三十五至一百四十；拉兹劳·克拉基，工作队队长，提高生产百分之一百二十至一百三十。几天以内，在三百余个工厂里，都开了生产会，决定加入肯兹机车厂发起的生产运动。
    乡村中的青年同样也参加了生产运动。他们组织收割队，打谷队，拔草犁地等各种生产工作。由于这些集体工作，结果在质上量上都提高了。例如：挪其采纳斯的青年组织了打谷队，他们的特点是让三十九个统一青年农民联合会的会员守卫田野。在共鲍斯浦兹太，青年农民工作队第一个完成打谷工作。无数组织在联欢会的鼓舞下，决定动员会员加强合作社运动。在索莫，吸收了一百二十个合作社社员。
    除了生产运动外，青年们设立各种学习班，学习关系联欢大会的各种材料。十万青年加入了五日学习班，这是他们参加大会的条件之一。学习班学习的是认识大会的重要性，世界青年联盟如何为和平而斗争；为什么联欢会在匈牙利举行，匈牙利青年应当怎样来接受这个荣誉。七月十一日一天，在六百个地区，开始了一万五千人的学习班。此外，匈牙利青年用种种方法和世界青联的各国团体会员和各联欢大会筹备委员会保持联系。匈牙利的无线电广播和报纸经常发出世界青年活动的消息。大多数青年刊物都登载这些消息。匈牙利全国到处都可以看见青年们在练习联欢大会的歌曲和舞蹈。差不多每一个青年都想学习几句外国语，以便向各代表团用该国语言致敬。
    布达佩斯三十多个工厂的青年和外国的工人同志作着联络的工作。采贝尔炼油厂的“青年工人联合会”会员向巴库的共产主义青年团联络。肯兹机车厂的青年工人和马尼托高尔斯克（苏联）青年工人联系；马伐克纺织厂的青年工人和斯高达的青年联系；基斯佩斯的纺织厂青工联和罗特兹（波兰）的青年工人联系。仅有数百居民的托尔特小市镇的青年们和古巴的青年保持联络。托尔特的农民青年预备好了刺绣的丝绢赠给古巴的青年朋友们。
    讲到赠送礼物，不仅在托尔特，整个国家各地都做了。匈牙利青年秘密预备着礼物以便到时候给人们以惊奇的喜悦。已经泄露的几个是：哈夫汉工厂准备了精细的小拖拉机，萨而各太若钢铁厂准备了一百样礼物。高路兹加巴蒂的青年预备了小刀盒，雕刻手杖，环柄皮鞭绣花衣和象征和平的鸽子。
    匈牙利青年热烈地为殖民地国青年代表募集费用。甚至有些小市镇也义卖大会纪念邮票或招特每个殖民地国的一个青年居住。
    三百个文化队参加了文化竞赛的选拔，其中三十个往文化营集中学习以便在大会上充当招待和指导员。数百个文化工作队下乡帮助青年农民了解大会意义。至于体育运动：十万零二千个青年在几个星期内参加“准备工作和战斗”运动。准备集体运动，特别是排球，至少已有三千二百个排球队已经组成。
    学习方面也不落后。青年们至秋季为止的各种职业班学习（准备入大学学习的青年工人和农民补习班）预定的三分之二已经上课。其中多数为大工业厂的青年工人。
    匈牙利青年用热烈的情绪欢迎共产主义青年团。女孩子在各地英勇牺牲的红军纪念碑上放置花束。在各机关里都布置了共青团栅，悬着斯大林同志的像及青年近卫军如左若和马特洛左夫的照片。
    匈牙利青年知道参加和帮助联欢大会，就等于增加了反帝国主义的斗争和国际和平营垒的力量。
