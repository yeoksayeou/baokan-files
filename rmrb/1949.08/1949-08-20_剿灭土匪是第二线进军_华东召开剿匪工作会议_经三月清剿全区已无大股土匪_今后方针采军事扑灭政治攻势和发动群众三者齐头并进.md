Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 19th—The East China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army convened a regional bandit suppression work conference starting on the 6th of this month. More than 40 representatives from various military districts and field army units participating in bandit suppression attended. The conference focused on discussing the unification of guidelines, policies, and steps in the suppression work, and exchanged experiences in bandit suppression from various regions. According to the reports presented by representatives from various military districts, the entire region has achieved significant results in bandit suppression in the past three months of May, June, and July, eliminating more than 25,000 bandits and special agent armed personnel, and seizing more than 10,000 rifles and carbines, and more than 600 light and heavy machine guns. Currently, with the exception of some mountainous areas, there are no large groups of bandits in the entire region. Yuan Zhongxian of the East China Military Region, Tang Liang, Director of the Political Department, and Zhang Kai, Deputy Director, all gave special reports at the conference on issues such as the understanding of bandit suppression tasks, policies, tactics, and political work. Yuan Zhongxian and others unanimously pointed out that in bandit suppression work, it is necessary to oppose the thought of complacency and a purely military perspective. It is essential to recognize that bandit suppression is not just a military task, but a major political task; it is a prerequisite for building newly liberated areas and carrying out rural work, and it is a second-line advance to coordinate with the large-scale advance of fraternal field armies.

　　The conference determined that the future guideline for bandit suppression work is to closely link military suppression, political offensive, and mass mobilization, with both military and political approaches working together, but with politics as the primary focus. Bandit suppression troops must simultaneously be working teams. Before and during the suppression, it is necessary to conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda to address the concerns of the masses; issue proclamations to reassure the people, clearly announce and explain the policies of the Chinese Communist Party, and expose all the rumors and deceptions of bandits and special agents; do more good deeds for the masses, such as water management and disaster relief, and help the masses solve difficulties in production. In short, it is necessary to unite, mobilize, and rely on the masses to eradicate the organizations and foundations of bandits and special agents. The army and local work should advance simultaneously, so that mass work keeps up with military victories. The conference pointed out that correct implementation of policies is the basic key to thoroughly eradicating bandits and special agents. The principle of "punishing the ringleaders, not questioning those who were coerced, and rewarding meritorious service" should be applied to bandits and special agents, combining leniency and suppression. Armed bandits and special agents engaged in open activities must be resolutely eliminated. The conference also decided that troops must abide by mass discipline and organizational discipline, and strictly implement the reporting system. The conference stipulated that bandit suppression troops should not raise grain locally, but the local government should uniformly transport grain from various places to supply them, in order to alleviate the burden on the people who have long suffered from the scourge of bandits and special agents. The conference particularly emphasized the unity and coordination in bandit suppression work, and that there must be consistency and close cooperation between urban and rural areas, between areas with bandits and areas without bandits, between the army and local areas, and between neighboring areas. The conference also conducted thorough research and deployment on the main tasks in the autumn bandit suppression. The conference lasted six days and ended on the 11th.

　　剿灭土匪是第二线进军
  　华东召开剿匪工作会议
    经三月清剿全区已无大股土匪
    今后方针采军事扑灭政治攻势和发动群众三者齐头并进
    【新华社南京十九日电】人民解放军华东军区本月六日起召开全区剿匪工作会议，出席各军区和参加剿匪的野战军部队代表四十余人。会议着重讨论了清剿工作中的方针、政策与步骤的统一问题，和交流了各区剿匪的经验。据各军区代表在会上的汇报，全区自五、六、七三个月来，剿匪已获重大成绩，共歼土匪特务武装二万五千余人，缴获长短枪万余支，轻重机枪六百多挺，现全区除一部分山区外，已无大股土匪。华东军区袁仲贤，政治部主任唐亮，副主任张凯在会上都分别对剿匪任务的认识、政策、战术和政治工作等问题作了专门报告。袁仲贤等一致指出：在剿匪工作中必须反对太平麻痹思想和单纯军事观点。必须认清剿匪工作不单是一个军事任务，而是一个重大的政治任务；是建设新解放区、开展农村工作的先决问题，是配合兄弟野战军大进军的第二线进军。
    会上确定了今后剿匪工作的方针是军事扑灭、政治攻势和发展群众三者密切联系，军政双管齐下，而以政治为主。剿匪部队必须同时是工作队。在清剿前与清剿中，要针对群众的疑虑，进行广泛和深入的宣传；要出布告，安人心，明确宣布和解释中共的政策，揭破土匪特务的一切造谣欺骗；要多替群众办好事，如治水救灾，帮助群众解决生产中的困难。总之，要团结、发动和依靠群众铲除土匪特务的组织和基础。军队和地方工作应齐头并进，使群众工作跟上军事胜利。会议指出，正确地执行政策是彻底肃清土匪特务的基本关键。对土匪特务应本“首恶必办、胁从不问、立功受奖”的原则，宽大与镇压相结合。对公开活动的土匪特务武装必须坚决消灭之。会议并决定，部队必须遵守群众纪律和组织纪律，严格执行请示报告制度。会议规定剿匪部队不就地筹粮，由地方政府统一从各地运粮供应，以减轻久受土匪特务荼毒的人民的负担。会议特别强调了剿匪工作中的统一和协同问题，城乡之间、有匪地区与无匪地区之间、部队与地方之间、友邻地区之间，均须步调一致，密切配合。会议对秋季剿匪中的各项主要工作也作了周密的研究与部署。该会历时六日，已于十一日结束。
