    Anti-Electricity Theft Campaign
    Citywide Investigation Underway
    Suburbs Begin Promotion Yesterday
    [This City News] The anti-electricity theft promotion in the city area, which began on July 17th and ended on August 7th, has come to a stage. A comprehensive inspection began on the 8th, and it is hoped that it will be completed within one month. During the promotion period, 62 households voluntarily reported electricity theft to the branch companies, 12 were reported by the Public Security Bureau, 17 were reported by company employees, and 26 were reported by others. 26 households applied for meter installation. In addition, many organizations and factories (such as the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau, the Military Control Commission Guesthouse, the 70th Ordnance Factory, etc.) have also voluntarily requested the branch companies to check whether their electricity use is illegal. The People's Liberation Army Beijing Automobile Repair Factory, formerly the Kuomintang United Logistics Headquarters 409 Automobile Factory, mostly stole electricity during the past reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The repair factory has also sent a letter to the branch company requesting a new meter.
    Publicity in the suburbs began yesterday (the 9th) in different districts, starting in the Mentougou district. It is scheduled to begin suburban inspections after September 10th.

    反窃电运动
    城区进行普查
    郊区昨开始宣传
    【本市讯】本市城区反窃电宣传自七月十七日开始至本月七日止，已告一段落，自八日起已开始普遍检查，希望在一个月内检查完竣。在宣传期间，窃电户自动向分公司报告者有六十二户，公安局检举者有十二户，公司职工检举者十七户，其他人检举者二十六户，申请装表者二十六户，此外尚有许多机关、工厂（如公安局内三分局，军管会招待所，七十兵工厂等）都自动请分公司代为检查他们用电有无不合法的情形。人民解放军北平汽车修配厂原为伪联勤总部四○九汽车厂，过去国民党反动统治时期大部分用电均系窃取，也经修配厂函请分公司重新按表。
    郊区宣传自昨（九）日起分区展开，首在门头沟区进行，预定九月十日后即开始郊区检查。
