Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 28th: The New York Worker's Daily reports: The New York State Committee of the CPUSA has called on communists, progressives, and their friends to attend the CPUSA's 30th anniversary celebration rally at Madison Square in New York on September 15th. Thompson, Chairman of the Communist Party of New York State, and Secretary Norman issued a statement convening the meeting, stating: "Our Party's 30th anniversary coincides with a time when American imperialism, through its willing tool – the Truman government – is fiercely trying to rule the world. Reactionaries are attempting to use every means to outlaw the Communist Party and expel it from American life as a preparatory action to destroy the democratic rights of all those who oppose another world war." "Our Party, in its rich past, has repeatedly faced such attacks. However, the Communist Party has not only resisted all these attacks, but each struggle has resulted in renewed energy and combativeness. Each attack is an exercise. After each exercise, the Communist Party moves forward with greater determination. The likes of Truman, Medina, McCosh, and Clark should heed the lessons of history." Today, on its 30th anniversary, the American Communist Party "is healthier and stronger than ever. People should know, where have those who once tried to destroy it gone?" The statement said: The rally at Madison Square will be a huge and combative protest against the heretical trial held at Foley Square, and will promote the campaign to win the re-election of the outstanding black and communist leader B. J. Davis as a city councilman this November.

The statement concluded: "We urge all communists to attend this rally, and call on them to bring their friends and acquaintances. The rally on September 15th should, must, and will become the most inspiring demonstration in defense of peace and people's rights ever seen."

　　美共纽约州委会
  　号召庆祝党的生日
  　抗议杜鲁门政府剥夺人权
    【新华社布拉格廿八日电】纽约工人日报报道：美共纽约州委会顷号召共产党员、进步分子和他们的朋友，参加九月十五日在纽约麦迪逊广场举行的美共三十周年庆祝大会，纽约州共产党委员会主席汤普生及书记诺曼发表召集这一会议的声明称：“我党的三十周年纪念，正是处在美国帝国主义通过它的甘心情愿的工具——杜鲁门政府——凶狠地力图统治全世界的时候。反动派正企图用尽一切方法，使共产党成为非法，把共产党驱逐出美国生活之外，以作为摧毁所有反对另一次世界大战的人们所赋有的民主权利的预备行动。”“我党在其丰富的过去，曾屡次面临这样的攻击。但是，共产党不仅抵抗住了一切这些攻击，而且每一次斗争的结果都保持了新的精力和战斗性。每一次攻击都是一次锻炼。共产党经过每一次锻炼，都带着更大的决心向前猛进。杜鲁门，麦迪纳，麦克哥希与克拉克之流，应该注意历史的教训。”今天，在其三十周年诞辰，美国共产党“比以往更加健全与更加坚强了。人们要知道，一度力图摧毁它的人们那里去了呢？”声明称：麦迪逊广场的集会，将是对于在福莱广场举行的异党审讯的巨大战斗性抗议，并将促进争取杰出黑人与共产党领袖Ｂ·Ｊ·戴维斯今年十一月连任市议员的竞选运动。
    声明的结语称：“我们敦促全体共产党员都出席这一集会，并号召他们带去他们的朋友和熟人。九月十五日的集会，应当、必须而且将会成为前所未见的最令人鼓舞的保卫和平与人民权利的示威。”
