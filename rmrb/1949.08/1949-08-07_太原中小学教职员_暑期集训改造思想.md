    Taiyuan Primary and Secondary School Faculty and Staff
    Summer Training to Reform Ideology
    [From Our Newspaper] Taiyuan City's primary and secondary school faculty and staff summer training, after four weeks of ideological reform, has achieved preliminary results. In the past, due to the deceptive propaganda of the Yan [Xishan] clique, they believed that the Communist Party rejected and killed intellectuals, and were very afraid. After the liberation of Taiyuan, as a result of the implementation of various policies of the Party and the People's Government, and after two cultural symposiums that focused on explaining the policies towards intellectuals, they gained a further understanding of the Communist Party. However, influenced by the Yan clique's rumor of "sweet first, then bitter," they still had some ideological concerns. Therefore, at the beginning of the teacher training, they thought it was the same as Yan's "personal training" to poison intellectuals. In their lives, they were hesitant and nervous, and they were afraid to speak at group meetings. In the second week, the leadership put forward the slogan "Dare to doubt, dare to speak." From their study life in the past week, they also felt that learning was not forced and that their actions were completely free. Some of the more ideologically pure young people began to raise questions, gradually unfolding heated debates. In the fourth week, special reports were made in a planned and focused manner based on the questions raised. Their erroneous understandings, such as hating Yan but not Chiang, and the belief that American imperialism was a friend of the Chinese people, were exposed in essence. Generally, they initially clarified right and wrong, and some people were even able to conduct ideological analysis and criticism of themselves. However, they felt that the struggle against landlords in the land reform was "excessive." They theoretically acknowledged the progressiveness of the proletariat and the thoroughness of the revolution, but they also felt that worker-peasant cadres lacked knowledge. Some older teachers had stronger old ideological consciousness. They came to the training only to keep their jobs, and some had the erroneous idea of "whoever's rice I eat, I'll say good things about them." This needs to be further resolved.

### 太原中小学教职员  暑期集训改造思想

    太原中小学教职员
    暑期集训改造思想
    【本报讯】太原市中、小学教职员暑期集训，经过四周来的思想改造，已获得初步成绩。过去由于阎匪的欺骗宣传，他们以为共产党排斥、杀害知识分子，心里非常害怕。太原解放后，党和人民政府的各项政策实施的结果，又经过两次文化座谈会，着重讲解了对知识分子的政策后，他们对共产党有了更进一步的认识，但受阎匪所造“先甜后辣”谣言的影响，仍有若干思想顾虑。因此教员集训开始时，他们认为和阎匪毒害知识分子的“亲自传训”一样，在生活上表现缩手缩脚，神经紧张，小组会上也不敢发言。到第二周领导上提出“大胆怀疑，大胆发言”的口号，他们从一周来的学习生活中，也感觉到学习既不是强迫进行，行动也完全自由，一部分思想较纯洁的青年便开始提出问题，逐渐地展开热烈争论，第四周即根据所提问题有计划、有重点地作专门性报告，对于他们的恨阎不恨蒋，美国帝国主义是中国人民的朋友等错误认识，从本质上给予揭发，一般都初步明确了是非，部分人甚至能对自己进行了思想上的分析、批判。但对土改中向地主斗争却感到“过分”，理论上承认了无产阶级的进步性及革命的彻底性，但对工农干部却又觉着无知识等。有部分年纪大的教员旧的思想意识较浓厚，为了保住饭碗才来集训，有的有“吃谁家的饭，就说谁家好”的错误想法，这须要继续予以解决。
