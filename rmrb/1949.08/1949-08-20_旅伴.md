Traveling Companion
By Soviet author, Panova, translated by Su Ling, reviewed by Cao Jinghua

Part One: Night
Chapter One: Danilov

The conductor on duty in the ninth carriage was Sukhoedov, a short man with square shoulders, a large head, and no neck. Besides the commander, he was one of the oldest people on the train. Danilov knew that Sukhoedov had fought against Yudenich back in the day (Note 1), and he volunteered to fight in the war against Finland, where he was wounded. On June 22nd, the day war was declared against Germany, he went to the conscription station and asked to be sent to the active army, but neither his age nor his health were suitable for combat service. Therefore, he was assigned to the ambulance train. At the time, his expression was very unpleasant, as if he hadn't received an award. Before the war, he worked in a coal mine near Moscow. The wrinkles on his face were all permeated with coal dust. His bright blue eyes had become child-like, glass-like eyes.

Sukhoedov stood by the window, not greeting Danilov, but turning his head for a moment and beckoning with his finger. Danilov walked over. Sukhoedov's face at that moment was unusual. Neither unpleasant nor sad. It was the face of a hunter tracking wild beasts.

"Is it there, have you seen it?" he asked in a low voice.

On the horizon, behind a low, dark forest, there was a moving light. Then the beam of a searchlight shone into the sky, a calm, silent, not very bright light, moving from side to side. Another beam of light came from somewhere nearby, the beams crossed, paused for a moment, and then separated, searching the sky.

"They're looking for him!" Sukhoedov said sternly.

"Haven't you heard anything?"

"Not a thing."

Sukhoedov paused briefly, listening carefully.

"They're fighting," he said indifferently. "Ah ha, they're really fighting fiercely there..." Then he took out his tobacco pouch from his pocket and rolled a cigarette.

"Do you smoke?" he asked, handing the tobacco pouch to Danilov.

"No, I don't."

"By the way, that's right," Sukhoedov said. "Smoking makes you cough terribly every morning—it's really awful. Even at the front, those who don't smoke are much more relaxed; they take a big worry off their shoulders: don't think about cigarettes. Don't learn this. It's terrible once you learn it."

Danilov smiled wryly.

"I've lived for thirty-eight years and haven't been hooked; I won't start now."

Sukhoedov raised his eyebrows in surprise, like a child:

"Are you really thirty-eight years old?"

"I'll be thirty-nine this spring."

"You look young," Sukhoedov said thoughtfully, carefully examining Danilov. "I thought you were thirty, thirty-two at most. Is life pleasant?"

"Pleasant or not, I don't know," Danilov replied. "But my past life has been very good, I could live like that for another hundred years and never get tired of it."

They were silent for a moment. Sukhoedov said strangely:

"Can't they kill you?"

The light outside the window crossed again, forming a stationary diagonal cross.

Danilov himself knew that they couldn't kill him. Life wouldn't just grab him so simply and destroy him. Everything had only just begun, nothing had been completed. It was only temporarily put aside. Only the argument with Piena was over. But perhaps—anything is possible in this world—he might meet her again someday. Then she would stand before him, bending over, looking up, shaking her heavy, damp hair... "Comb it for me, Danilov," and say... Foolish, childish absurdity, which cannot be admitted to anyone, not even to oneself.

Behind the light wound soldier's carriage was a pharmacy car. No one knew why this car was given such a name. The pharmacy only occupied a small room on the car. The remaining space was used as a dressing room, shower room, and ventilation equipment. The office had a writing desk for the medical secretary. The staff list included such a position. There was no such title on the train before. Danilov didn't know what a medical secretary should do, and no one knew; therefore, Danilov simply didn't assign anyone to this position when replenishing the personnel.

The pharmacy car was Danilov's favorite car at the time. He fell in love with its white color, nickel-plated equipment, oilcloth, airtight doors, and folding tables and chairs placed against the wall at first sight. Danilov's habit was cleanliness and comfort. He had a loving heart for this beloved car. He wiped the glass on the windows with a handkerchief to see if there was any dust. On the first day, the female pharmacist spilled some iodine on the newly painted blue and white table. Danilov saw the stain and his face turned pale with heartache. Nurse Muhinna frantically maintained the impossible sterile cleanliness required by the commissioner.

Muhinna had just been to the shower room. She stood by the table, her dark brown head with a cloth nurse's cap, deeply lowered, she was wrinkling gauze. At that time, the windows were all covered with curtains, and the electric lights were on.

"What are you doing?" Danilov asked.

She turned her big freckled, kind, sleepy white face towards him.

"Covers," she said with a weary sigh.

"Making another one? A lampshade?"

"No, for the shower head." (To be continued)

    第一部　夜
    第一章　达尼洛夫
    在第九辆车厢里值班的是苏霍耶杜夫，他是一个矮个子，方肩，大头，没有脖子。除了司令以外，他要算列车里年纪最大的人了。达尼洛夫知道苏霍耶杜夫在当年曾打过尤德尼奇（注一），在对芬兰作战中，他当志愿军参战受了伤。六月二十二日，对德宣战的那天，他到了征兵站上，要求派他到现役军里去，可是无论照他的年纪，也无论照他的健康看来，都不适于战斗服役的。因此，就把他派到救护列车上来了。当时他的面色非常难堪，就好象他没有得到奖似的。战前他在莫斯科附近煤矿上工作。他脸上的皱纹里，全浸透了煤灰。他那一付明亮的蓝眼睛，成了孩子般的琉璃色的眼睛了。
    苏霍耶杜夫站到窗子跟前，没有向达尼洛夫迎上去，只顷刻间转过头来，用手指招呼了一下。达尼洛夫走到跟前。苏霍耶杜夫的面容当时是不平常的。不难堪，也不悲苦。那是紧追着野兽踪迹的猎人的面容。
    “是在那儿呵，你见了吗？”他低声问着。
    在地平线上，在一片低矮的黑森林后边，有一种光在移动着。于是探照灯的光线投到天空里，从容的，无声的，不很显亮的光线，向左右移动着。另一道光线从旁边的什么地方投来，光线交叉起来，静止了一会儿就分开了，在天空里搜索着。
    “在找他呢！”苏霍耶杜夫严厉的说。
    “你一点也没听说吗？”
    “一点也没听说。”
    苏霍耶杜夫少停了一下，细听着。
    “在打呢，”他带理懒理的说着。“呵哈，在那儿打得真凶呢……”于是把烟布袋从衣兜里掏出来，就卷起烟卷来。
    “你抽烟吗？”他把烟布袋伸给达尼洛夫，问道。
    “不，不抽。”
    “顺便提一句，这是对的，”苏霍耶杜夫说。“抽烟每天早晨咳嗽得要命——真糟极了。就是在前线，谁不抽烟，谁就轻松得多；把很大的顾虑从肩上卸下去吧：别想烟吧。你别学这吧。一学会就糟了。”
    达尼洛夫冷笑了一下。
    “活了三十八岁了，没有上钩；现在是不会再抽了。”
    苏霍耶杜夫小孩似的，吃惊的抬起眉头来：
    “难道你可三十八岁了吗？”
    “今春交三十九岁了。”
    “你看来年轻着呢，”苏霍耶杜夫仔细端详着达尼洛夫，沈思的说。“我看你有三十岁，顶多三十二。是生活愉快吧？”
    “愉快不愉快，我不晓得，”达尼洛夫答着。“可是我已往的生活是很好的，这样的生活我再过一百年，怕也不会累呢。”
    他们少沈默了一下。苏霍耶杜夫奇怪的说：
    “他们打不死你吗？”
    窗外的光线，又交叉成一个斜十字，凝然不动了。
    达尼洛夫自己也晓得他们打不死他的。人生不会就这样简简单单的捉住他就毁了的。一切都刚才开始，什么也没有完成的。只不过是暂时搁起来罢了。只是同裴娜作为罢论了。可是或许——人间无奇不有呢——他将来说不定有一天会碰见她呢。那时她站到他面前，弯着腰，仰着头，摇着那沉重而湿润的头发……“替我梳一梳吧，达尼洛夫，”并且说……糊涂呵，幼稚的荒唐呵，对谁也不能承认，甚至连对自己也不能承认的呵。
    轻伤士兵车厢的后面，挂着一辆药车。为什么给这辆车起了这么一个名字，谁也不知道。药室在车上只占了一小间。剩下的地方作了裹伤室，淋浴室和通风装备。办公室放着一张医务秘书用的写字棹。职员名单上开着这样的职务。从前列车上是没有这项名称的。达尼洛夫不晓得医务秘书应该办些什么事，而且没有人晓得的；因此，达尼洛夫在补充人员编制的时候，简直没有委派何人来担任这项职务。
    药车当时是达尼洛夫最爱的一辆车。一眼就看上了它的白颜色，镍质的装备，油漆布，密闭的门，以及靠墙放的能开合的桌椅。达尼洛夫的癖是清洁与舒适。他对这辆心爱的车，怀着一片热爱的心情。用手帕拭着窗子上的玻璃，看有灰尘没有。女药剂师头一天就把蓝白色的新漆的桌子上，洒了一些碘酒。达尼洛夫看见了污斑，心痛得脸都发白了。女护士穆恒娜手忙脚乱的维持着委员所要求的这种不可能的消毒的清洁。
    穆恒娜刚到淋浴间去了一下。她站在桌旁，戴着布护士帽的暗棕色的头，深深儿低着，她正在皱着纱布。当时窗子都挂着窗帘，电灯在开着。
    “你作什么呢？”达尼洛夫问着。
    她转过那大雀斑的，仁慈的，睡意朦胧的白面孔对着他。
    “罩子，”她带着一声疲倦的叹息说。
    “再作一个吗？作灯罩吗？”
    “不，作喷头罩的。”　　　　　　　　　　　（未完）
