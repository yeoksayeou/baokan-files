New Democratic Cooperative
    Xue Muqiao

    A cooperative is a form of collective economic organization of working people. In the new democratic China, our cooperatives, under the leadership of the new democratic state and the state-owned economy, unite the vast number of small producers (farmers and handicraftsmen) and other working people, becoming an important component of the new democratic economy. This cooperative is the working people's own economic organization, its purpose is not to exploit the working people, but to protect the working people's own economic interests, so it is different from the capitalist economy. However, under the current situation in China, this cooperative economy is still built on the basis of private property; in a certain period, it still takes the individual economy as its foundation; therefore, it is also different from the socialist economy. It is a semi-socialist economic form.

    The main task of cooperatives in the new democratic state is, first of all, to support mass production and protect the working people, so that they are free from the control and exploitation of commercial capital. Although small producers (farmers and handicraftsmen) produce independently, they must rely on the market to purchase tools and raw materials, and sell products (agricultural products and handicrafts). They are scattered, poor, and unfamiliar with market conditions, so they are often controlled and exploited by commercial capital (commercial capital often manipulates prices to exploit these small producers); sometimes, the difficulty in purchasing raw materials and the stagnation of products make it impossible for them to reproduce smoothly. The working people are not only exploited by the bourgeoisie in the production process, but they are also often subjected to layers of intermediate exploitation by commercial capital in consumption, that is, when purchasing living materials. Therefore, the primary task of cooperatives is to organize supply and marketing, and to fight against the speculative behavior of commercial capital, in order to protect the interests of the vast number of small producers and consumers.

    The second task is to make the cooperative a bridge between the state-owned economy and the vast number of small producers, and to consolidate the alliance between the state-owned economy and the vast number of small producers through it. If the state-owned economy does not unite the vast number of small producers (mainly farmers) through cooperatives, it will not be able to consolidate its leading position in the national economy. Conversely, if cooperatives do not receive the leadership and support of the state-owned economy, they will not be able to develop soundly.

    The last task is to transform small producers and gradually collectivize their individual economies. If small producers are not organized to carry out collective production, it will be impossible to greatly improve their productivity, let alone transform them into a socialist economy. However, collective production must be built on the basis of machine production, and manual production is not suitable for large-scale collective production (a high degree of collectivization of agricultural production must also take land nationalization as its necessary premise). Therefore, before the industrialization of our national economy is completed, this transformation work should not be rushed. Today, our cooperatives can generally only be built on the basis of individual economies, such as labor mutual aid organizations based on small-scale farming, and supply and marketing cooperatives based on small-scale farming and family handicrafts. Highly collectivized organizational forms such as cooperative farms and cooperative factories can at most only be tested individually today, and should not be universally promoted.

    According to the above principles, today's cooperatives in the new China mainly include the following:

    The first type is production groups, such as mutual aid teams and work-exchange teams in agricultural production, and production groups (or small cooperatives) in handicraft production. This kind of production group is not only very small in scale, but also only a temporary collective labor and division of labor and cooperation, so as to rationally use its existing various production conditions (labor, land, tools, livestock, etc.) to overcome certain difficulties in the production process. But even such a small, temporary, and incomplete cooperative organization may play an extremely important role in promoting production development under the current situation in China.

    The second type is supply and marketing cooperatives, which are much larger in scale than production groups and are also more complete cooperative organizations. The farmers and small producers who participate in the cooperative still produce independently; they rely on the cooperative to ensure the supply of tools and raw materials, as well as the sales of various products, avoid the manipulation and exploitation of commercial capital, and enable their reproduction to proceed smoothly. Under the current situation, this kind of supply and marketing cooperative is most suitable for the needs of farmers and handicraftsmen, and can be universally developed. In rural areas, comprehensive supply and marketing cooperatives of agriculture and handicrafts can be organized with townships or villages as units; in cities, various types of handicraft supply and marketing cooperatives can be organized.

    The third type is consumer cooperatives, which provide the broad masses of people with various genuine living materials, so that they can avoid the intermediate exploitation of merchants. Consumer cooperatives should first be widely established in factories, schools, institutions, and troops, and gradually popularized to the general urban people. The grain, cloth, and cotton supplied by the government can be distributed through cooperatives when the supply is in short supply, in order to ensure the appropriate living standards of the working people. In rural areas, consumer cooperatives can also be combined with supply and marketing cooperatives to become the concurrent business of supply and marketing cooperatives.

    The fourth type is credit cooperatives, which adjust funds among small producers, operate deposit and savings businesses, and help small producers solve the difficulties of lack of funds. Credit cooperatives can be organized independently in some occasions, and can generally become the concurrent business of supply and marketing and consumer cooperatives. After implementing equal shares and stopping capital dividends, adopting various methods to absorb members' deposits will become an important source of cooperative funds.

    The fifth type is production cooperatives for collective production, such as cooperative farms and cooperative factories. This kind of production cooperative has already abolished the individual economy and implemented collective production (common production, distribution according to work); it can only be universally developed on the basis of land nationalization and machine production, so it should not be promoted today.

    The above-mentioned cooperatives are distributed in rural and urban areas, becoming the economic fortresses of the broad masses of people, especially the vast number of small producers. In order to closely integrate thousands of cooperative organizations with the state-owned economy, we must also establish cooperative agencies at all levels, such as central, provincial, county, and city levels. In this way, through cooperatives at all levels, the economic life of the state-owned economy and the broad masses of people, especially the vast number of small producers, is closely linked, so that our national economy has a considerable degree of organization and planning, which is an extremely important guarantee for completing the new democratic economic construction and moving towards socialism.

    新民主主义的合作社
    薛暮桥
    合作社是劳动人民的集体的经济组织的一种形式。在新民主主义的新中国，我们的合作社在新民主主义国家和国营经济的领导下，团结了广大的小生产者（农民和手工业者）以及其他劳动人民，成为新民主主义经济的重要构成部分。这种合作社是劳动人民的自己的经济组织，它的目的不是为着剥削劳动人民，而是为着保护劳动人民自己的经济利益，因此它与资本主义经济不同。但在中国的现状下，这种合作社经济还是建筑在私有财产基础上的；在一定的时期内，它仍然以个体经济为其基础；因此又不同于社会主义经济。它是一种半社会主义的经济形态。
    新民主主义国家的合作社的主要任务，首先是扶助群众生产，保护劳动人民，使他们免受商业资本的控制和剥削。小生产者（农民和手工业者）虽然各自独立生产，但他们采购工具、原料，销售产品（农产品及手工业品），必须依赖市场。他们分散，贫困，不熟悉市场情况，因而常受商业资本的控制和剥削（商业资本常常操纵物价，来剥削这些小生产者）；有时且因原料的难购，和产品的滞销，使其再生产不能顺利进行。劳动人民不但在生产过程中要受资产阶级剥削，他们在消费中，即在采购生活资料的时候，亦常常受商业资本的一层层的中间剥削。因此合作社的首要任务，是要组织供销，与商业资本的投机行为作斗争，以保护广大的小生产者和消费者的利益。
    其次一个任务是要使合作社成为国营经济与广大的小生产者之间的桥梁，通过它来巩固国营经济与广大小生产者的联盟。国营经济如不通过合作社来团结广大的小生产者（其中主要的是农民），则将无法巩固它在国民经济中的领导地位。反之，合作社如果得不到国营经济的领导和扶助，亦不可能健全发展。
    最后一个任务是要改造小生产者，使他们的个体经济逐渐地集体化。小生产者如不组织起来进行集体生产，便不可能大大地提高其生产力，更不可能改造而为社会主义经济。但集体生产必须建筑在机器生产的基础上，手工生产是不适宜于大规模的集体生产的（农业生产的高度的集体化更必须以土地国有为其必要的前提）。因此在我国民经济的工业化尚未完成以前，这种改造工作不宜操之过急。今天我们的合作社一般地仍只能建筑在个体经济的基础上，如以小农经营为基础的劳动互助组织，和以小农经营及家庭手工业为基础的供销合作社等。象合作农场，合作工厂等类高度集体化的组织形式，今天至多只能个别试验，不宜普遍提倡。
    按照上述原则，今天新中国的合作社，主要的有下列几种：
    第一种是生产小组，如农业生产中的互助组、变工组，和手工业生产中的生产小组（或称小型合作社）。这种生产小组不但规模很小，而且只是一种临时性的集体劳动及分工合作，借以合理地使用其现有的各种生产条件（劳力、土地、工具、牲畜等），克服生产过程中的某些困难。但即使是这样小型的、临时的、不完全的合作组织，在中国的现状下，也可能对生产的发展起极重要的推动作用。
    第二种是供销合作社，这比生产小组规模要大得多，也是较完全的合作组织。参加合作社的农民和小生产者仍然各自独立生产；他们依靠合作社来保证工具和原料的供给，以及各种产品的销售，避免商业资本的操纵和剥削，并使其再生产能顺利进行。在目前的状况下，这种供销合作社最适合于农民和手工业者的需要，可以普遍发展。在农村中，可以乡或村为单位组织农业和手工业的综合的供销合作社；在城市中则可组织各种性质的手工业供销合作社。
    第三种是消费合作社，它供给广大人民以各种货真价实的生活资料，使他们能避免商人的中间剥削。消费合作社应当首先在工厂、学校、机关、部队中普遍建立起来，逐渐普及到一般城市人民。政府所供给的粮食、布棉等，在供不应求时，可以通过合作社来实行配给，以保证劳动人民的适当的生活水平。在乡村中，消费合作社也可以与供销合作社相结合，成为供销合作社的兼营业务。
    第四种是信用合作社，它在小生产者中间调剂资金，经营存放、储蓄等类业务，帮助小生产者解决缺乏资金的困难。信用合作社在某些场合可以独立组织，一般可以成为供销及消费合作社的兼营业务。在实行平均入股，停止资金分红后，采用各种方法吸收社员们的存款，将要成为合作社资金之一重要来源。
    第五种是集体生产的生产合作社，如合作农场和合作工厂等。这种生产合作社已经取消个体经济，实行集体生产（共同生产，按劳分配）；只有在土地国有，和机器生产的基础上才能普遍发展，所以今天还不应提倡。
    以上各种合作社分布在乡村中、城市中，成为广大人民的、尤其是广大小生产者的经济堡垒。为使千千万万的合作社组织能与国营经济密切结合，我们还必须建立合作社的各级机构，如中央和省、县、市等各级组织。这样通过各级的合作社，而把国营经济与广大人民，尤其是广大小生产者的经济生活密切联系起来，使我们的国民经济具有相当程度的组织性，计划性，这是完成新民主主义经济建设，和走向社会主义的极重要的保证。
