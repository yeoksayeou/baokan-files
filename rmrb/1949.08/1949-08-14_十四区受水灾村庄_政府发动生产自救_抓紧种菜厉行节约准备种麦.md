    Villages in the Fourteenth District Affected by Floods
    Government Launches Self-Salvation Through Production
    Seizing the Time to Grow Vegetables, Practicing Strict Economy, and Preparing to Plant Wheat
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Yinghai and Sihai villages in the Fourteenth District have been severely affected by floods. Most crops have been drowned or waterlogged. The most severely affected area is Nangong, where more than 1,600 mu of crops were drowned or damaged out of the village's total of 1,740 mu of land. Furthermore, due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' plunder last year, the laboring masses have no savings, making production and disaster relief work an urgent task. The Fourteenth District Office has issued instructions to various villages, notifying village cadres that they must mobilize the masses, formulate specific plans based on local conditions, and summarize experiences and report to the District Office at any time.
    1. It is necessary to mobilize and educate the masses to engage in self-salvation through production, not relying on heaven or believing in gods, and not solely relying on government relief. Eliminate pessimistic sentiments, take action, and overcome the disaster. At present, it is still necessary to attach importance to flood prevention and water diversion, grasp the spirit of saving every crop that can be saved, and mobilize the masses to find ways to divert and drain water.
    2. It is necessary to seize the opportunity to plant a large number of vegetables and all possible late-maturing crops.
    3. It is also possible to help the masses carry out all possible side occupations in a planned way, based on local actual conditions.
    4. Call on the masses to practice strict economy, oppose waste, and encourage them to plan and budget more carefully for their livelihoods. Go deep into the homes of poor people and discuss with them: how to solve the problem of insufficient grain before the wheat harvest next year?
    5. Call for early preparation for wheat planting, accumulate more fertilizer, and be sure to plant more drought-resistant wheat.
    6. Emphasize that village cadres should take practical responsibility for leadership. In areas severely affected by the disaster, self-salvation through production should be the primary task, and significant achievements must be made. The extent to which cadres serve the masses is an important test of their work.

    十四区受水灾村庄
    政府发动生产自救
    抓紧种菜厉行节约准备种麦
    【本报讯】十四区瀛海庄、四海庄一带，受水灾严重，大部庄稼被淹死涝伤，最严重的如南宫，全村一千七百四十亩地，淹死伤庄稼即达一千六百多亩。又由于去年国民党反动派的搜刮，劳苦群众家无积蓄，生产救灾工作已成为迫切任务。十四区公所为此向各村发出指示，通知各村干部必须动员群众，根据当地具体情况，作出具体计划，并随时总结经验，报告区公所。
    一、应该发动与教育群众，生产自救，不靠天，不信神，不单纯的依靠政府的救济，取消悲观情绪，行动起来，战胜灾荒。目前仍要重视防洪顺水，掌握能救活一棵庄稼就要多救一棵的精神，发动群众设法顺水淘水。
    二、要抓紧时机大量种菜及一切可能晚熟作物。
    三、还可根据当地实际情况，帮助群众有计划的进行一切可能作的副业。
    四、号召群众厉行节约，反对浪费，让群众在过光景上多打算，多计划。要深入到贫苦群众家中，与他们商量：明年麦收前的粮食不够用，如何解决？
    五、号召早作种麦的准备工作，多积肥，一定多种旱麦。
    六、强调村干切实负责领导，水灾严重地区，应把生产自救作为首要工作，必须作出显著成绩，干部为群众服务程度如何，此工作是一个重要的考验。
