    Preventing Bad Elements from Sabotaging the Autumn Harvest
    Suburban Areas Organize Autumn Protection
    [Report from this newspaper] On August 3rd, the Shijingshan District Committee and District Government convened a meeting of village chiefs and agricultural association directors from various villages to study weeding and autumn protection work. Following this, each village launched mobilization efforts. Xihuang Village had already organized an Autumn Defense Committee by the 6th. As the village is composed of three natural villages, the autumn protection work is being carried out jointly by the three villages. The cadres of the three villages jointly formulated a preliminary plan, determining the number of guards and their remuneration based on the area of each village. Subsequently, a general meeting of agricultural association members was held in each village. The meeting began by raising the masses' vigilance with the fact that landlords had sent people to steal crops and sabotage production in Gong Village (one of the natural villages), and explained how this year's crop watching differed from last year. In the past, crop watching served the landlords and wealthy peasants, and everything was decided by them and the chiefs, who then collected money from poor households. This year, the landlords' land has been confiscated, and most poor households and landless tenants have land to cultivate. Crop watching has become a matter for all the people in the village. Therefore, in addition to finding honest and reliable people to watch the crops, all the people in the village have a responsibility to prevent, monitor, and report bad elements. Then, group discussions were held. The attending peasants agreed with the plan put forward by the village cadres and nominated candidates on the spot. Nine people were selected from the three villages to jointly take charge of crop watching, under the joint leadership of the police station, village government, and agricultural association. The public security team also volunteered to patrol the countryside regularly to assist in autumn defense. (Zhou Jican)
    [Report from this newspaper] On August 6th, Houfeng Administrative Village in the 13th District convened a conference of village heads and agricultural association group leaders from all natural villages in the village to discuss the issue of organizing the masses to watch the autumn harvest. The meeting decided to hire people according to the amount of land in each natural village, with the cost not exceeding one jin of millet per mu of land. They are looking for honest and responsible people to watch the crops. At the same time, all villages (natural villages) should maintain good contact, watch over each other, and help each other, changing the previous attitude of ignoring someone stealing crops from another village to avoid thieves taking advantage of loopholes. If anyone is caught stealing the autumn harvest, they will be dealt with in accordance with government laws.

    防止坏人破坏秋收
    郊区组织护秋
    【本报讯】八月三日，石景山区委会，区政府召集各村村长及农会主任对锄草及护秋作了研究后，各村即展开动员工作，西黄村已于六日组织了秋防委员会。按该村由三个自然村组成，护秋工作即由三村联合进行，三村干部共同定出初步计划，按照各村的面积定出各村看青人数及报酬，然后又在各村召开村农会会员大会，会上首先以当天在龚村（自然村之一）所发生的地主派人偷青破坏生产事实来提高群众的警惕，并说明今年看青与去年的不同。在过去，看青是给地主富农们服务，一切也都是由他们和保长决定好了向贫户收钱。今年，地主土地已被没收，一般贫户及无地佃户有了地种，护秋工作成了全村人民的事情。因此除要找出老实可靠的人来看青外，全村的人民都有防备、监视、检举坏人的责任。接着便分组讨论，到会农民同意了村干们提出的计划，并当场提出了人选。三村选出九人，共同负责护青工作，由派出所、村政府、农会共同领导，公安队并愿经常下乡巡逻，协助秋防。  （周际参）
    【本报讯】十三区厚俸行政村于八月六日召开了全村各自然村的闾长、农会组长等干部大会，讨论组织群众看秋问题，会上决定按自然村土地多少雇人的办法，代价最多每亩地不超过一斤小米。找老实负责任的人看秋。同时各村（自然村）都取好联系，各村互相看管，彼此互助，改变以前各村眼看有人偷别村庄稼也不管不问的态度，以免小偷钻空子。如捉住偷秋的，一定按政府的法令处理。
