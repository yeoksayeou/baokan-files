　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 16th: Tass, Ottawa, 12th: Truman's special envoy, US Secretary of Defense Johnson, arrived in Ottawa on the 11th to attend a meeting of the Canadian government's defense committee. According to press reports, the talks will discuss a "coordinated continental joint defense plan" and may also discuss the issue of merging Canadian and US troops.

　　It is expected that the Canadian government will raise the issue of Canada supplying Western Europe with weapons in exchange for US dollars with Johnson. More than a year ago, a Canadian company in Washington obtained many US licenses and drawings, established several munitions factories, and began manufacturing munitions, hoping to sell them to Marshall Plan countries in exchange for US dollars. This plan was considered likely to prevent the impending crisis of Canada's foreign trade deficit. However, Truman's plan to supply Western Europe with $1.45 billion worth of weapons has dealt an unexpected blow to Canada. The Canadian cabinet held a special meeting on August 10. Well-informed reporters asserted that the meeting discussed the issue of requesting permission for Canada to participate in the sale of weapons to Western Europe.

　　美战贩詹森抵加拿大传将讨论“联防计划”
    【新华社北平十六日电】塔斯社渥太华十二日讯：杜鲁门总统的特使、美国防部长詹森于十一日到达渥太华，参加加拿大政府防务委员会的会议。据报界消息，会谈将讨论“配合大陆联防计划”，并可能讨论把加拿大军队与美国军队合并的问题。
    预料加拿大政府方面将向詹森提出加拿大以武器供给西欧以换取美元的问题。一年多以前，加拿大在华盛顿的公司取得美国的许多许可证和图样，建立成了几个军火工厂，并且开始制造军火，希望能够卖给马歇尔化国家换取美元。这个计划被认为可能防止即将来临的加拿大对外贸易逆差的危机。但杜鲁门提出的以十四亿五千万元供给西欧武器的计划，却给加拿大以预料不到的打击。加拿大内阁在八月十日召开特别会议。消息灵通的记者断言：这次会议讨论了要求准许加拿大参加对西欧出卖武器的问题。
