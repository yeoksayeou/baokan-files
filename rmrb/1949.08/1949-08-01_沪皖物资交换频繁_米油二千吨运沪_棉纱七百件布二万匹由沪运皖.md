    [Shanghai News] The material exchange between Shanghai and Anhui is expanding daily. There have been two large-scale material exchanges. The first batch involved 108 ships, and the second batch involved 45 ships. The third batch of exchanged materials is expected to arrive in Shanghai around August 10th. It is reported that this batch will involve nearly 100 ships, carrying approximately 2,000 tons of materials including rice, soybeans, sesame oil, and soybean oil. In order to greatly supply Shanghai's needs, a decision has been made to transport another 5,000 tons of rice, wheat, soybeans, hemp, tobacco leaves, and cowhide to Shanghai. The transportation method for this batch of materials is planned to first use trains to transport them to Pukou, and then use ships to transport them to Shanghai. The Northern Anhui Trading Company in Shanghai exchanged local products for 700 bales of cotton yarn, 20,000 bolts of cloth, and 100,000 gunny sacks, which were loaded onto trains on July 25th and transported to Bengbu.
