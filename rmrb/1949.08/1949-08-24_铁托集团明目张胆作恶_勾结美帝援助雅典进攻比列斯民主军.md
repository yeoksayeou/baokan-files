Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, August 23rd: The Tito traitorous clique's crime of colluding with the United States to help the Greek Royalist fascists attack the democratic army has reached a point of brazenness. According to a report from the Free Greece News Agency transmitted by Telepress on August 21st: The Tito representative in Athens, in a recent meeting with the Deputy Foreign Minister of the Athens government, demanded that the Athens government eliminate the Greek democratic army in the Belles region of Eastern Macedonia in order to open the road for the Tito government to transport American goods from Thessaloniki. Following this, on the recommendation of the American military delegation, the Greek Royalist fascist army launched an offensive in the Belles region to satisfy the demands of the Tito clique. The conditions put forward by the Americans and the Royalist fascists to the Yugoslav government were: The Yugoslav border guards adjacent to the Belles region must assist the Royalist fascist army in this battle. Furthermore, according to a TASS dispatch from London on August 20th, the Athens government's spokesman in Britain, quoted by a reporter from the Daily Telegraph and Morning Post, stated that Tito's stance toward the democratic army has facilitated the actions of the Royalist army to some extent. The reporter for this newspaper admitted that without Tito's help, the Royalist fascist army would not have been able to launch an offensive.

　　铁托集团明目张胆作恶
  　勾结美帝援助雅典进攻比列斯民主军
    【新华社北平二十三日电】铁托叛徒集团勾结美国帮助希腊保皇法西斯进攻民主军的罪行，已达到明目张胆的地步。据电通社转自由希腊通讯社八月二十一日消息：铁托驻雅典代办在最近与雅典政府副外长会谈中，曾要求雅典政府肃清东马其顿比列斯区的希腊民主军，以便开放由萨罗尼加将美国货物运交铁托政府的道路。在此之后，在美国军事代表团的建议下，希腊保皇法西斯军就在比列斯地区开始了攻势，以便满足铁托集团的要求。美国人和保皇法西斯向南斯拉夫政府提出的条件是：毗邻比列斯区的南斯拉夫边防军，必须在此次战斗中援助保皇法西斯军。另据塔斯社伦敦二十日电，每日电讯晨邮报记者引雅典政府驻英发言人谈称，铁托对民主军所采取的立场，在某种程度上便利了保皇军的行动。该报记者承认如果没有铁托的帮助，保皇法西斯军就不可能发动攻势。
