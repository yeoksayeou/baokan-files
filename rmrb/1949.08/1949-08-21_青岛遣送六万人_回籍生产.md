Qingdao Sends 60,000 People Back to Their Native Places for Production

[Qingdao News] The Qingdao Municipal People's Government has sent 60,000 "refugees" back to their native places for production. These include landlords and rich peasants who fled from various counties, as well as masses who were coerced and deceived by the Kuomintang bandit gangs when they fled to Qingdao from various counties. When Qingdao was liberated, there were a total of 290,000 "refugees" in the city, of which about 170,000 could support themselves, and the rest had no proper occupations. In order to stabilize urban order and strengthen rural production, the Qingdao authorities began to organize forces and actively carry out repatriation work after liberation. First, cadres were mobilized, divided into groups, and went deep into various districts to educate the "refugees." Mass meetings to protect the people were held to explain the current situation and point out their future. Their criminal facts were individually exposed, and our lenient policy was explained to make them recognize their mistakes, bow their heads to the people and repent, and provide them with the convenience of hiring vehicles and boats. After education, the "refugees" registered one after another. As of August 3rd, more than 60,000 people have been registered and issued passes and returned to their native places voluntarily.

　　青岛遣送六万人
  　回籍生产
    【青岛讯】青岛市人民政府已遣送“难民”六万人回籍生产。其中包括各县逃来的地主、富农，及国民党匪帮从各县逃窜来青时裹胁欺骗来的群众。青市解放时，全市共有“难民”二十九万人，其中能自食其力的约十七万余人，其余多无正当职业。青市当局为安定城市秩序加强农村生产，于解放后即着手组织力量，积极进行遣送工作。首先调集干部，划分小组，深入各区对“难民”进行教育，分别召开保民大会，说明目前形势，指出他们的前途，并个别的揭发了他们的罪恶事实，讲明我们的宽大政策，使其认识错误，向人民低头悔过，并给予代雇车船的便利。经过教育后，“难民”纷纷登记，截至八月三日止，经登记发给通行证及自动回籍者，已有六万余人。
