Xian People's Broadcasting Station Broadcast: Xianyang News: In order to enable private industry to recover and develop rapidly, the People's Bank of Xianyang Office has successively loaned 6.3 million yuan to nine handicraft textile factories and two flour mills from late July to the beginning of this month, with an interest rate of 1.5%. Most of these textile factories were forced to shut down after the Anti-Japanese War because they could not withstand the dual oppression of American imperialism and Kuomintang bureaucratic capital. Now, with the assistance of loans from the People's Bank and the trade company's purchase of finished products, they have quickly resumed production.
