    On Nursery Issues
    ——A Response to Mr. Shan Yu and Others
    To Mr. Shan Yu, Wang Fei, Zhang Guifang, Zhang Wenhui, Gong Wen, Lu Xiaoting, Zhou Yuncheng, and Wang Leng:
    Regarding your inquiries about issues concerning homes for the disabled, orphanages, nurseries, etc., we provide the following comprehensive answers based on our knowledge:
  Homes for the Disabled
    There is no home for the disabled in this city. There is only a home for the elderly, located at Jiaozihu Tong in Guangnei, which can accommodate disabled individuals. Currently, the facility is full, so the admissions are limited to elderly, weak, and disabled impoverished citizens residing within the city limits who genuinely have no means of support. Regarding admission procedures, you can apply for an introduction through the district office in your jurisdiction.
  Orphanages
    The orphanages in this city include: the Private Ren Ci Tang Orphanage, located at 26 East Jia Dao, Xishiku, Inner Sixth District; the Private Canaan Orphanage, located at Jia 27 Ganmian Hutong, Eastern City, etc. Their admissions are limited to orphans and cannot be claimed. As the orphanage has not yet registered with the Civil Affairs Bureau to approve admission procedures, inquiries can be made at the respective orphanages.
    The "Yuyou Suo" is the abbreviation for the Nursery of the Relief Institute of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Beijing Municipal People's Government. Its address is 8 Shibei Hutong, Western City. It continues to accommodate beggars, but because it is already at full capacity, future admissions will be limited to impoverished and orphaned children residing in the city, aged seven to fourteen. The facility has a complete primary school with two first-grade classes and an attached kindergarten. During the summer vacation, the daily schedule is as follows: wake up at 6:00 AM, breakfast at 6:30 AM, morning exercises at 7:00 AM, classes from 7:30 AM, dismissal at 12:00 PM, lunch at 12:10 PM, afternoon nap at 1:00 PM, extracurricular activities at 3:00 PM, rest at 5:00 PM, dinner at 6:00 PM, and bedtime at 9:00 PM. The diet consists mainly of millet and cornmeal. Admission procedures require review and introduction by the district office.
  Nurseries
    The nurseries in this city include: the Private Yuqun Nursery, located at 22 Xihuying, Qianmenwai; the Private Beijing YWCA Nursery, located at 18 Xitangzi Hutong; the Private Infant Care Center, located at 12 Zaolin Street, Second District; the Private Shengci Nursery, located at 1 Yanqing Lane, Nanchizi Duanku, and several other locations. The monthly fee (in millet) ranges from 120 to approximately 350 jin. Information regarding the childcare methods and admission procedures can be obtained by visiting them directly. As for free nurseries, none have been established in this city yet.

    关于托儿所诸问题
    ——答山雨等先生
    山雨、王非、张贵芳、张文辉、弓文、逯笑亭、周云城、王冷诸先生。
    你们询问关于残废人救济院、孤儿院、托儿所等问题，就我们所知道的，综合答复如下：
  残废院
    本市并无残废人救济院，只有一个安老所，在广内教子胡同，可以收容残废人。现在该所已经满额，故收容对象只限于城区以内的，无依无靠老弱残废，生活确实无着的贫苦市民。至于收容手续，可向该管区区公所申请介绍。
  孤儿院
    本市孤儿院，计有：私立仁慈堂孤儿院，住内六区西什库东夹道二十六号；私立迦南孤儿院，住东城干面胡同甲二十七号等处。其收容对象只限孤儿，不能领取。该院等尚未呈准民政局登记胡入院手续可往各该院询问。
    育幼所系北平市人民政府民政局救济院育幼所之简称，其地址为西城石碑胡同八号，现仍继续收容乞丐，但因收容额位已满，故今后收容仅限住于城区，贫寒及孤苦的儿童，年龄七岁至十四岁为合格，该所设有完全小学，一年级分两班并附设幼稚班。在署假期间生活情况是早六时起床，六时半早餐，七时早操，七时半上课，十二时下课，十二时十分午餐，下午一时午睡，三时课外活动，五时休息，六时晚餐，九时就餐，食粮以小米玉米面为主。入所手续须经区公所审核介绍。
  托儿所
    本市托儿所，计有：私立育群托儿所，住前门外西湖营二十二号；私立北平市基督教女青年会托儿所，住西堂子胡同十八号；私立婴儿寄托所，住二区枣林街十二号；私立圣慈托儿所，住南池子缎库延青里一号等数处。每月收费（小米）是一百二十斤到三百五十左右，其托儿办法和入所手续，可亲往询问。至于免费的托儿所，本市现在还没有设立。
