Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 26th: TASS, Moscow, August 25th: The Literary Gazette published an article by Vostokov on the situation in the Indonesian Republic, pointing out that the attempt by colonial countries, led by the United States, to destroy the Democratic Republic of Indonesia by force of arms has failed. Therefore, American expansionists are carrying out political conspiracies to subvert the Republic from within. To this end, they are using the reactionary leaders of the Islamic Party and the Kuomintang, Sukarno, Hatta, and Sudirman, who are shocked by the ever-expanding Indonesian national liberation movement. After declaring the Democratic Front illegal, the political nature of the Sukarno-Hatta group has been fully exposed. Prominent leaders of the Indonesian national liberation movement, such as former Prime Minister Sjahrir, Communist Party Secretary Muso, and former Indonesian Republic's diplomatic representative to Central Europe, Suripno, have been ordered to be murdered by Wall Street's running dogs. The Sukarno-Hatta group has thus betrayed the fruits of the Republic and is carrying out American orders. With the help of the Sukarno-Hatta group, American capital is seizing important positions in Indonesia and attempting to enslave this resource-rich country. According to recent reports, three-quarters of Indonesia's raw materials are shipped to the United States. American monopoly capitalists have concluded a treaty with Hatta to exploit Indonesia's raw material resources. In early August, the Dutch authorities and the Sukarno-Hatta group issued a joint ceasefire order in Indonesia; at the same time, they announced the holding of a so-called round table conference in The Hague. Hatta's communique when he left for The Hague mentioned that "the round table conference will resolve the future status of Indonesia and the transfer of sovereignty to its 70 million people," which is just a despicable lie. The plan in The Hague is undoubtedly to strangle the Indonesian Republic and turn all its achievements into nothing. They are trying to make Indonesia subject to the Dutch royal family, the only difference being that this time American capital will rule the country.

The Indonesian problem cannot be "resolved" in The Hague or in Washington. This problem is being and will be resolved in the struggle of the Indonesian people against the Hatta traitorous group and any foreign aggressors. Under the guidance of the National Democratic Front led by the Communist Party, the Indonesian masses continue to fight against the Dutch imperialists and their overseas protectors. The leading body of the underground National Democratic Front calls on the Indonesian people to expel the occupiers and their agents, pointing out that the only way to resolve the Indonesian dispute is to withdraw all Dutch troops and the colonial government from Indonesia, form a new government of the National Democratic Front, and recognize the Indonesian Republic as a sovereign state. The National Democratic Front is now leading the Republic's army and guerrillas in the struggle for complete national independence.

### 苏联文学报　评印尼形势

  　评印尼形势
    【新华社北平二十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十五日讯：文学报刊载伏斯托柯夫论印尼共和国情势一文指出：以美国为首的殖民国家欲凭借武器摧毁印尼民主共和国的企图，已经失败，因此，美国扩张主义者便进行政治阴谋，以便从内部来颠覆共和国。为此目的，他们利用为日益扩大的印尼民族解放运动所震惊的资产阶级的回教党与国民党的反动领袖苏加诺、哈达和苏狄曼。在宣布民主阵线为非法之后，苏加诺——哈达集团的政治性质已暴露无遗。印尼民族解放运动的杰出领袖——前总理沙利佛丁、共产党书记穆索、前印尼共和国驻中欧的外交代表苏利普诺等已被华尔街的走狗下令屠杀了。苏加诺——哈达集团就这样出卖共和国的果实，并执行着美国的命令。美国资本借苏加诺——哈达集团之助，夺取印尼的重要阵地，并企图奴役这个原料富庶的国家。据最近消息，印尼出产的原料四分之三都运往美国。美国垄断资本家与哈达缔结条约以开采印尼的原料资源。八月初，荷兰当局与苏加诺——哈达集团在印尼发布联合停战令；同时宣布在海牙召开所谓圆桌会议。哈达动身赴海牙时的公报中，曾提到“圆桌会议将解决印尼将来地位及移交主权给其七千万人民的问题”，这只是卑贱的谎话而已。海牙的计划无疑的是要扼死印尼共和国，并使其一切成就化为乌有。他们正试图使印尼听凭荷兰皇室摆布，唯一的区别或者是这一次美国资本将统治该国。
    印尼问题不可能在海牙，也不可能在华盛顿“解决”，这个问题正在和必将在抵抗哈达卖国集团及任何外国侵略者的印尼人民的斗争中加以解决。在共产党领导的民族民主阵线的引导下，印尼人民大众继续与荷兰帝国主义者及其海外保护人斗争着。处在地下的民族民主阵线的领导机构，号召印尼人民驱逐占领者及其代理人，指出解决印尼纠纷的唯一方法，是从印尼境内撤退所有荷兰军队和殖民政府，组成民族民主阵线的新政府并承认印尼共和国为主权国。民族民主阵线现正领导着共和国军队和游击队进行争取国家完全独立的斗争。
