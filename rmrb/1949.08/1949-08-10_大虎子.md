    Big Tiger

    Big Tiger's family was very poor. The pants he wore couldn't cover his bottom, and his clothes couldn't cover his chest. He was as black as a little pig all over. All day long, he carried a stinky manure basket,鑽来钻去鑽来钻去, and he returned to that dilapidated thatched cottage to eat and sleep. Big Tiger is thirteen years old this year, and he has lived this kind of life for thirteen years.
    Although Big Tiger is young, he is very good at using his brain. He knows that "democracy" has arrived, and everyone's life will be better. But why is he still living the same kind of life as before? Others can go to school, but he still can't? One day, he asked his father about the things he couldn't understand. His father couldn't explain anything either, but instead scolded Big Tiger, so he didn't dare to ask anymore.
    One day, the children in the town, carrying the flag of the Children's Corps, went to the countryside to find all the children together, taught them to sing, and told them many truths, that the democratic government would help the poor. As long as everyone organizes together, comes up with ideas together, and works hard together, life will get better.
    Soon, the Children's Corps in the countryside was established. Big Tiger felt very itchy in his heart. He understood the benefits of joining the Children's Corps, especially that he could also learn to read. But his father had told him long ago not to join the Children's Corps, that joining would delay picking up manure, and in the future he would be dragged away to be a little soldier. Big Tiger didn't believe it, but he would be beaten if he didn't listen to his father. One morning, he took his manure basket to pick up manure as usual. On the road, he ran into a group of Children's Corps members. They were going to cut grass and pick up manure together. They were talking and singing all the way, having a great time. Big Tiger couldn't help it, so he quickly ran over to the head of the group, Little Lin, and said: "Can I join the Children's Corps? With you!"
    The people in the Children's Corps clapped their hands when they heard what he said, and shouted "Welcome"! In this way, Big Tiger became a member of the Children's Corps. This day, Big Tiger was so happy that he went to pick up manure with everyone and learned to sing. The happiest thing was that he recognized the three characters "Children's Corps"! And he could write his own name! It was getting dark, and Big Tiger's manure basket was already full. As soon as he entered the village, he saw his father waiting for him with a stick. Big Tiger saw that there was no way out, so he had to bite the bullet and walk in. Finally, the mouth full of stiff beard spoke:
    "You bad seed, who told you to join the Children's Corps? Do you really want to be taken away to be a little soldier?"
    Big Tiger was not afraid at all when he heard his father's words, because he had already discussed the way to answer with the other members. So he puffed out his chest and said:
    "Dad, listen to me, don't beat me, I am a member of the Children's Corps now. If you beat me, the other members will come to 'struggle' against you, because now there is democracy. Why don't you let me join the Children's Corps? Are you afraid that we will be little soldiers? What do they want little soldiers like us who can't even hold a gun? I can learn to read and sing every day in the Children's Corps, and I am not allowed to be lazy in doing housework. We will also have production competitions in the future! What's wrong with that?"
    After hearing Big Tiger's words, his father didn't have the stick in his hand anymore. He went out to talk to the neighbors about farming without saying a word.
    From that day on, Big Tiger's heart was settled. Whether he went out to pick up manure or after eating, he always lived with the children. When picking up manure, he sang with everyone, and when he rested, he learned to read. Every day he could recognize three characters, and he could also write them, because he would draw them on the ground with a stick when he returned home. His father saw that he was different from the past, that he had become well-behaved, so he didn't bother with him anymore.
    When attending a small team meeting, Big Tiger expressed his opinion that he had not said several times. He said:
    "Didn't we say before that we would have a production competition? How about we have a competition now? I report to everyone that from tomorrow, in addition to picking up a basket of manure every day, I will also pick up twenty catties of grass. Who will compete with me!"
    When everyone heard his words, they all muttered together and agreed with Big Tiger, so they competed.
    The next day, before dawn, Big Tiger carried a manure basket and took a sickle and went out. On the way, he picked up manure when he saw manure, and cut grass when there was no manure. He forgot to go back for breakfast. While doing it, he thought in his heart: "If I produce more, I will get first place. I will take the grass back and ask my dad to sell it, and my family will have money." At that time, I will ask my dad to buy me a pencil and a notebook. I will pick up more grass in the future, and I will have more money, and I can wear new clothes!" He was thinking and doing this when it was past noon. Looking at the manure basket, it was almost full, and there was a large pile of grass. He was really happy. Carrying the basket and dragging the grass, he ran and jumped back home. His father was very happy when he saw it. He pointed to the grass and smiled and said:
    "Good boy, there are twenty catties. Go eat quickly. You haven't eaten breakfast. Don't exhaust your body."
    After Big Tiger came back in the evening, he went to find the people in the small team as soon as he put down his rice bowl, shouting from afar.
    "Hey, today I picked up a basket of manure and thirty-four catties of grass!"
    The word spread really fast, and by the next day, all the members of the Children's Corps in the village knew about this, and everyone said that Big Tiger was a "model."
    A few days later, the village Children's Corps held a general meeting, and everyone wanted Big Tiger to be the production model. Big Tiger was really embarrassed, and another member of the Children's Corps said:
    "Let Big Tiger be our deputy head of the group and lead us in production. Does everyone agree?"
    Everyone agreed, so Big Tiger was the deputy head of the group. Big Tiger said to everyone:
    "In the future, we must work hard in production, and everyone will enjoy the benefits. Anyone who doesn't work hard is a little turtle!"
    Later, Big Tiger led everyone to pick up manure and grass every day, and learned to read when he was free.
    Now Big Tiger has recognized more than 400 characters and is running around in the fields all day long, wearing the blue jacket and pants that his father bought for him.

    大虎子
    陶影
    大虎子家里穷得很，他穿的裤子盖不住屁股，衣裳遮不住胸口，浑身黑得象只小猪，整天背着臭烘烘的粪筐子，在脏地方钻来钻去，吃饭睡觉就回到那所破得不成样子的茅屋里。大虎子今年十三岁，这样的生活也就过了十三年。
    大虎子年纪虽小，可顶会动脑筋的，他知道，“民主”来了，大家日子会过得好起来。但是，他为什么还是过着以前那种日子呢？别人有书念，自己还是念不成？有一天，他把他想不通的事情去问他爸爸，他爸爸也说不出什么道理来，反而将大虎子骂了一顿，他就不敢再问了。
    一天，镇上的小孩子，打着儿童团的旗子，到乡下把所有的小孩子找到一起来，教他们唱歌，还讲了许多道理，民主政府是会帮穷人的忙的。只要大家组织起来，一起出主意，一起出劲干，日子就会好过起来的。
    不久，乡下的儿童团成立了，大虎子心里很痒痒的，他懂得参加儿童团的好处，尤其是还可以识字。但是爸爸早就对他说过了，不准参加儿童团，参加了会耽搁拾粪的，将来还会被拉去当小兵的，大虎子虽然不相信，可是不听爸爸的话会挨打的。一天早晨，他照旧拿了粪筐子去拾粪，在路上碰到一批儿童团，他们是一起去割草、拾粪的，一路上有说有唱，快活透了。大虎子实在忍不住，就赶快跑过去向走在前头的团长小林说：“我能参加儿童团吗？跟你们一起！”
    儿童团的人听了他的话就拍起掌来了，还叫着“欢迎”哩。就这样，大虎子便是个儿童团员了。这一天，大虎子快活透了，跟着大家一起去拾粪，还学唱歌，最快活的是“儿童团”三个字他认识了。并且还可以写自己的名字哩！天快黑了，大虎子的粪筐子已经满满的了，一进庄子，就看见他爸爸拿着棍子在等着他了，大虎子一看没办法，只好硬着头皮走了进去。终于，长满了硬胡子的嘴说话了：
    “你这个坏种，哪一个要你去参加儿童团的？你真想被人家带去当小兵吗？”
    大虎子听了他父亲的话，一点都不害怕，因为他早就同旁的团员商量好了回话的法子，于是把肚子挺了挺说：
    “爸爸，你听我说，可别打我呀，我现在是儿童团员了，你打了我别的团员会来‘斗’你的‘争’，因为现在是有民主了呀。你为什么不让参加儿童团呢？你怕要我们去当小兵吗？我们这些枪都拿不动的小兵他要做什么哩？我参加儿童团天天可以识字、唱歌，做家里的事也不准偷懒，以后我们还要比赛生产呢！这有什么不好呢？”
    父亲听了大虎子的话以后，棍子已经不在手上了，一声不响便出去跟邻居谈庄稼去了。
    从那天起，大虎子心就定下来了，出去拾粪也好，吃过饭也好，总是跟儿童们生活在一起，在拾粪的时候就跟着大家唱歌，歇下来的时候就学字，每天他都能认识三个字，而且还能写得出，因为他一回到家里就用棍子在地上画。父亲看他和过去不同了，变乖了，也就不去管他了。
    开小队会的时候，大虎子把好几次没有说出口的意见发表了，他说：
    “以前我们不是说过要比赛生产的吗？现在就来让我们比一下好吗？报告大家，明天起，我除了每天拾一筐粪外，还要拾二十斤草，哪个跟我比呀！”
    大家听了他的话，就一起咕哩咕哩起来了，都赞成大虎子，于是就比起来了。
    第二天，天还没大亮，大虎子就背了粪筐子，带了一把镰刀出去了，一路上看见粪就拾粪，没有粪就割草，早饭都忘记回去吃了，一面做，一面心里想：“我生产多了就要得第一了，把草拿回去，要爹爹卖掉，我家钱就有了”，那时候要爹爹替我买一只铅笔，买一个本子，我以后拾的草更多，钱也更多了，我就可以穿新衣裳了！”他这样想着做着天已经过午了，再看看粪筐子也快满了，草也有一大堆，真高兴呀，背着筐子拖着草；又跑又跳的回到家里，他父亲一看真高兴呀，指了一指草，笑了说：
    “乖乖，有二十斤哩，赶快吃饭去，早饭都没吃，不要把身子累坏了。”
    大虎子晚上回来以后，一放下饭碗，就去找小队里的人了，老远就喊起来了。
    “喂，今天我拾粪一筐子，拾草三十四斤！”
    话传得真快呀，到第二天全村的儿童团都知道了这件事，大家都说了大虎子是“模范”。
    又过了几天以后，村儿童团开大会，大家都要大虎子当生产模范，大虎子真不好意思，又有一个儿童团员说：
    “让大虎子当我们的副团长，领导我们生产，大家说同意不同意？”
    大家都同意了，于是大虎子就是副团长。大虎子对大家说：
    “以后我们的生产要出劲干，得了好处大家享福，哪一个不出劲，就是小乌龟！”
    后来，大虎子天天带着头要大家拾粪、拾草，闲下来就学字。
    现在大虎子已经认识四百多个字了，整天穿着他父亲替他买的蓝小褂裤，在田里跑来跑去。
