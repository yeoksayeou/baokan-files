(Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station, 22nd broadcast) Shanghai news: Cultural and educational circles in this city have denounced the White Paper published by American imperialism. Writer Feng Xuefeng said: The publication of the White Paper by American imperialism is intended to carry out new conspiracies in an attempt to alienate the Chinese people from their friendship with the Soviet Union. Writer Hu Feng said: American imperialism wants to organize the remaining reactionary forces and ideologically confused elements in China to undermine the new, people's democratic China, but this conspiracy will not succeed. A responsible person from the Poetry Association said: The White Paper published by the United States is a confession of American imperialists' aggression against our country by various methods and means. The preparatory committee of the Fine Arts Association issued a statement saying: Imperialists are sworn enemies of the world's proletariat and all new democratic countries. We must strengthen our internal unity and education to make "democratic individualists" vigilant and to completely collapse the plots of American imperialism. Chen Baichen of the drama circles said: The Chinese people have stood up. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its brilliant leader Mao Zedong, and with the support of the progressive people of the world, they will certainly defeat all the conspiratorial activities of American imperialism, just as they smashed the Kuomintang reactionary army nurtured by American imperialism. Chen Wangdao, Hu Quyang, Pan Zhenya, Zhou Gucheng and others from the education circles jointly issued a statement saying: The so-called liberal intellectuals or democratic individualists in our country should awaken after reading the White Paper and destroy all the conspiracies of American imperialists to undermine the Chinese revolution to the end. The Democratic Women's Federation issued a written opinion stating: The White Paper published by the U.S. State Department still uses its consistent deceptive techniques, but in fact it nakedly confesses all its ambitions to invade China. We tell the imperialists that it is precisely the imperialists, especially the American imperialists, who have invaded China, that have made us deeply understand the correctness of Marxism-Leninism and the system of people's democratic dictatorship led by the Chinese Communist Party. We women recognize the face of American imperialists and know how to respond to your White Paper with our actions. The person in charge of the Medical Workers' Union said: We medical workers must unite, step up our studies, recognize the conspiracy of American imperialism, and resolutely fight to the end for the establishment of a new China.
