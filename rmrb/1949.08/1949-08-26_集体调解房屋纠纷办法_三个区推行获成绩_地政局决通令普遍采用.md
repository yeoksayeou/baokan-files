Collective Mediation of Housing Disputes
	Successful Implementation in Three Districts
	Land Administration Bureau Decides to Issue Order for Universal Adoption

	[This City News] The Seventh District and the Third and Ninth Districts of Ping City have successively adopted different types of collective mediation methods for housing disputes, and have achieved results. The Municipal Land Administration Bureau held a joint meeting of cadres from the mediation sections of each district on the 22nd. After detailed research, it was decided to issue an order for universal adoption in all districts; and it was called upon that all districts continuously research and improve their work, in order to replace the manual labor-style working method of case-by-case mediation. For more than two months, each district has actively mediated housing disputes based on the spirit of the Military Control Commission's proclamation on the city's housing issues on May 16, achieving considerable results. However, due to case-by-case mediation, the strength of cadres was dispersed, making it impossible to explain the People's Government's urban housing policy in detail to both landlords and tenants, resulting in low work efficiency, with each cadre handling less than two cases and settling less than one case per day on average. The Seventh District Public Office piloted the collective mediation method in July, convening symposiums for both parties involved in similar types of cases, explaining the policy in detail, analyzing the causes of the disputes, exposing and correcting the erroneous thinking of both parties, and hoping that both parties would negotiate and reconcile themselves after the meeting based on the principle of mutual benefit. The results of the pilot implementation were good. Compared with June, the percentage of mediation settlements in the Seventh District in July increased from 60% to 75%. After seeing the preliminary results of the Seventh District reported in the newspaper, the Third and Ninth Districts adopted it in early August. The Third District's first collective mediation of four cases, after explaining the policy, let it go its own way without assisting in reconciliation, and as a result, not a single case was settled. Later, this shortcoming was corrected. In the second batch of sixteen cases, only one case was not settled. Compared with July, the percentage of mediation settlements in the Third District in early August increased from 60% to 80%. In the Ninth District's first collective mediation of twenty cases, sixteen cases were settled. The second time, because too many cases were convened, there were thirty cases at once. After explaining the policy, the strength of the cadres was dispersed, and they could not effectively assist in reconciliation, but twelve cases were still settled. Later, the Ninth District corrected this shortcoming, and the percentage of mediation settlements increased again, with an average of six housing disputes being resolved every day.

　　集体调解房屋纠纷办法
  　三个区推行获成绩
    地政局决通令普遍采用
    【本市讯】平市第七区与三、九两区先后采用分别类型，集体调解房屋纠纷的办法，已获成绩。市府地政局于廿二日召开的各区调解科干部联席会上，经过详细研究后，决定通令各区普遍采用；并号召各区于工作中不断研究改进，用以代替逐案调解的手工业式的工作方法。两月余来，各区根据五月十六日军管会关于本市房屋问题布告的精神，积极调解房屋纠纷获得相当成绩。但是由于逐案调解，干部力量分散，无法对房东房客双方详尽地解释人民政府城市房屋政策，因之工作效率不高，平均每个干部每天处理不到二件，成立不到一件。七区区公所于七月份试行集体调解的办法，召集同类型诸案件的双方当事人举行座谈会，详细说明政策，分析发生纠纷的原因，揭露并纠正双方的错误思想，希望双方根据两利的原则会后自行协商和解。试行结果，成绩良好，与六月份相较，七月份七区调解成立的百分率由百分之六十提高到百分之七十五·三、九两区见报载七区初步成绩后，即于八月上旬分别采用。三区第一次集体调解四案，于讲解政策后，听其自流，不再从旁协助和解，结果一案都不成立。后来纠正了这个缺点，第二次十六案中，只有一件不成立。与七月份相较，三区八月上旬调解成立的百分率由百分之六十提高到百分之八十。九区第一次集体调解的二十案中，成立的有十六件。第二次因召集的案件太多，一次就有三十件，讲解政策后，干部力量分散，不能有效的协助和解，但成立的仍有十二件。后来九区纠正了这个缺点，调解成立的百分率又形增高，平均每天可解决六件房屋纠纷。
