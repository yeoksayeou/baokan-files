    Summer Students
    ▲ Youth Academy has decided to end on the 18th of this month. It is planned that on the morning of that day, all the students participating in the academy will hold a grand closing ceremony. In the afternoon, there will be a sports meet with various sports performances and dance performances. In addition, a singing competition will be held by district. The Southeast District Recreation Department has decided to form a joint choir of 300 to 500 people. All school choirs, classes, groups, and research associations can sign up to participate. In order to give play to the students' creative spirit, it was also decided that students should write popular songs that are in line with academy life, and submissions are now being solicited.

    ▲ After the summer study group wrote to the comrades of the southward work team, they have now received many replies. The letters expressed gratitude for the students' warm expectations. One comrade wrote in his letter: "Receiving your letter encouraged us and laid the foundation for our determination to serve the people. We will answer your hopes for us in our work and practice."

    ▲暑期学习团给南下工作团同志写信后，现在已经收到很多回信，信里对同学们热诚期勉表示谢意。一个同志信中这样说：“接到你们的来信使我们得到鼓励，奠定了为人民服务的决心，我们要在工作上和实践中来答复你们对我们的希望。”
