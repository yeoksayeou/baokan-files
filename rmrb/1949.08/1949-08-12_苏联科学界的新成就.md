New Achievements of Soviet Science
Translated by Hong Mo

Soviet science is the most advanced science in the world. Soviet science "is not isolated from the people, does not detach itself from the people, but is prepared to serve the people, prepared to dedicate all scientific achievements to the people, and this service to the people is not compulsory, but spontaneous and voluntary." (Stalin's words)

The Soviet people treat scientific workers with respect, and the people use their knowledge to build all creative possibilities, and also reward the work of scientific workers with the highest honors.

Stalin, the leader of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet people, said in his historic speech at the election meeting on February 9, 1946: "I have never doubted that if we give our scholars the necessary assistance, they will not only reach, but also exceed the current scientific level abroad."

In fact, as Pravda said on the day of the announcement of the Stalin Prize winners in 1948, just looking at the brief list of Stalin Prize winners last year clearly shows how much Soviet science, under the leadership of the Party, has progressed along the path indicated by Stalin.

Among those who won the Stalin First Class Prize were: Professor Vernov for his outstanding achievements in cosmic ray research - cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere. Lysenko's "Agricultural Biology" published last year is a new achievement of advanced Michurin biology. Female agricultural science doctor Ba Heta Jie won the award for her research on the elimination and seed improvement of tea plants in the field of biology, which led to the new varieties of Georgia No. 1 and No. 2 tea. Professor Bugasov and Kamilaz were awarded the prize for co-authoring "The Elimination of Potatoes." Medical doctor Arapov and agricultural college member Berlinji determined a new therapeutic serum. A lathe operator Boltgaivech from the "Sverdlov" machine manufacturing factory in Leningrad and two lathe operators Markov and Ugolkov from the "Red Proletarian" factory overcame technical difficulties, established rapid processing methods, and guaranteed increased productivity. Their creative contributions simply affect the fate of the development of the Soviet metal processing industry.

There are also more than 20 other award-winning scientific workers, including workers, engineers, scholars, etc. Each of them has made outstanding contributions, which we don't need to list one by one, but from the above, we can see two characteristics:

First, we can see the triumph of ardent supporters of Michurin science.

Second, the outstanding Soviet worker Boltgaivech and other manufacturing reformers clearly fulfilled Stalin's words: "The pioneers of new scientific and technological roads are not well-known celebrities in the scientific community, but completely unknown people in the scientific community, ordinary people, but reformers of practical undertakings."

So, do the achievements of those who won the Stalin Second Class Prize have no significant decisive significance?

Regarding this, I only need to mention two discoveries and inventions that won the second prize, and you can know the general idea:

Soviet agriculture has obtained a new machine - the No. 7 synthetic flax harvester. This machine pulls the flax from the ground, arranges the tips, and bundles the stalks. Its productivity can work five hectares a day. Using this machine, each hectare of harvest field can save 12 to 14 people, that is, 70 people can be saved a day. At the same time, it also reduces the loss of flax fiber and seeds, and can quickly harvest flax to improve the quality of flax. There is no such machine abroad. Therefore, designers Shi Lixianfu, Mayete, and Moigeiyev won the Stalin Second Class Prize.

Doctor of Geological Mineralogy Vlasov and geologists Sivrin and Koshenz won the Stalin Second Class Prize for their great geological discoveries that are difficult to evaluate. Under their direct leadership, iron ore layers were discovered on the Kola Peninsula, thus guaranteeing the construction of a new non-ferrous metal industry in the Northwest. This kind of geological research can help determine the tasks of the national economy.

In short, Soviet science never stops at existing achievements. Our motherland is gradually being enriched by ever-changing creations, and those best creators are given the Stalin Prize to commend and praise them.

Long live the Stalin Prize winners! Long live the best of the best representatives of our Soviet science! Dedicate your genius to the victory of the cause of communism!

    苏联科学界的新成就
    洪模编译
    苏联的科学是世界上最前进的科学。苏联的科学“不与人民隔离，不脱离人民，而是准备为人民服务，准备将一切科学的成就供献给人民，并且这种服务于人民不是强制的，而是自发自愿的”。（斯大林语）
    苏联的人民以尊重的态度对待科学工作者，人民用自己的学识建设了一切创造的可能性，还以最高荣誉的褒奖来表扬科学工作者们的劳作。
    布尔塞维克党和苏联人民的领袖斯大林，于一九四六年二月九日选举大会的具有历史意义的讲演内曾说：“我从不怀疑，假如我们给我国的学者们以必要的协助，他们便不仅能达到，而且能超过现时国外的科学水准的”。
    而实际上，正象真理报在一九四八年斯大林奖获得者公布日所说的，只要看看去年斯大林奖获得者的工作简表，就很明显表现出，在党的领导下苏联科学顺着斯大林指示的道路，迈了多大的步伐。
    获得斯大林一等奖的有：维尔诺威教授在宇宙线研究方面有卓越的成就——高气层的宇宙线。李森科去年发表的“农业生物学”是前进的米邱林生物学的新成就。女农业科学博士芭荷塔杰在生物学领域研究茶植物的淘汰和种子改良而引出了格鲁吉亚第一号及第二号茶的新品种。布加索夫教授和卡米拉兹二人因合著“马铃薯的淘汰”而获奖。医学博士阿拉波夫及农业学院会员百林基确定出一种新治疗用血清。一位在列宁格勒的“斯维德罗夫”工作机器制造厂的旋盘工鲍尔特盖维奇和两位在“红色无产阶级”工作的旋盘工马尔克夫及乌哥尔可夫都因克服技术上的困难，树立迅速加工方法，保证提高了生产率，他们的创造贡献简直影响到苏联金属加工工业发展的命运
    其他还有二十余人获奖的科学工作者，包括工人、工程师、学者等等，每人都有卓越的贡献，我们无庸一一列举，但由以上所举之中，可以看出两点特征：
    第一可以看出米邱林科学的热心拥护者的凯旋。
    第二苏联优秀工人鲍尔特盖维奇和别的制造改革者显明地应验了斯大林的话：“新的科学及技术道路的开拓，不是众所周知的科学界名人，而是在科学界完全默默无闻的人，平凡的人，可是实际事业的改革者。”
    那么获得斯大林二等奖的人的成就，是不是便没有什么显著的决定的意义呢？
    关于这方面，我只要举出两个获二等奖的发现和发明，你便可以知道大概了：
    苏联的农业获得新的机器——合成式割麻机第七号。这机器把麻从地中拔出后，将梢部排好，把杆编成束。他的生产率一天能工作五公顷。采用此机器每一公顷收获场可以节省出十二至十四人，也就是一天可省七十个人。同时又减少麻纤维及种子的损失，又能很快的收获麻，以使麻的质量提高，这类的机器在国外还没有过。所以设计者施李先夫，马也特，莫伊盖也夫获斯大林二等奖。
    地质矿物学博士夫拉少夫和地质学者西夫林及科深兹，由于在地质上的难以评价的伟大发现获斯大林二等奖，在他们的直接领导下，在科尔斯科半岛发现铁矿层，这样西北新金属工业的建设便有了保证，象这种地质学的研究是能协力决定国民经济的任务的。
    总之，苏联的科学是永远不停留在已有的成就上的。我们的祖国逐渐被日新月异的创造富足起来，而那些最优秀的创造者便被给予斯大林奖以褒奖表扬。
    斯大林奖获得者万岁！我们苏联科学优秀中的优秀代表万岁！供献你们的天才为共产主义事业的胜利尽力吧！
