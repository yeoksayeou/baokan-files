    Two Thousand People Celebrate Communist Youth League Day at Peking University's Democracy Square; Over One Hundred Outstanding Youths Join the League
    [This newspaper dispatch] The members of the Peking Municipal Middle School and University Students' Summer Study Group of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League held Communist Youth League Day yesterday evening (the 7th) at Peking University's Democracy Square. A total of over two thousand League members, students, and guests attended. Twenty red flags fluttered in the wind, surrounding portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Above, the giant portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu looked down kindly on the youths present. To the south was a giant red banner reading: "Study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, Integrate with Reality, Promote the Spirit of Democratic Unity, Master the Weapon of Criticism and Self-Criticism, and Strive to Establish a Revolutionary Worldview."
    The members of the Summer Study Group, in over twenty days of intense study, together with their fellow students, have greatly improved. Today, they are relaxed and happy as they celebrate this meaningful League Day with their fellow students, while also welcoming one hundred and one new comrades into the League. Everyone shouted: "Revolutionary youths unite!" "Welcome new comrades!" and sang enthusiastically: "Young people, burning hearts, following Mao Zedong forward."
    The conference began in the majestic strains of the Internationale. First, Comrade Zhang Dazhong, Secretary of the League Committee, gave a report. Comrade Zhang first extended a warm welcome on behalf of the League Committee to the one hundred and one new comrades, saying, "Being approved to join the League is an honor for the new comrades, but you must not be arrogant, you must study more humbly and sincerely, help others to learn, and at the same time learn from others, so that you can continuously improve." He also explained that with the help of the organization, one can progress faster and serve the people better. Finally, Comrade Zhang encouraged everyone to unite the students better with the help of the organization and advance together under the banner of Mao Zedong.
    Next was the oath-taking ceremony for the one hundred and one new League members. These hundred-plus young men and women, who emerged from their studies and whose political consciousness has been raised, raised their hands in the light rain and recited the oath firmly: "Forever follow the Communist Party... Guarantee to do our utmost for revolutionary construction, and fight to the end for the complete realization of New Democracy in China and the complete liberation of all mankind!"
    At this point, as the rain began to fall harder, everyone entered the lecture hall to continue the meeting. The new League members spoke freely.
    Finally, each sub-group performed exciting cultural programs, including waist drum dances and the "Liberated Area Chorus."
