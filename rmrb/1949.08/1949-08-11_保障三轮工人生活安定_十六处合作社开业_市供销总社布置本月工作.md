    Guaranteeing the Stability of Tricycle Workers' Lives
    Sixteen Cooperatives Open
    City Supply and Marketing Cooperative Sets Up Work for This Month
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to stabilize the lives of citizens and safeguard the interests of the working people, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative have begun establishing street cooperatives starting in August. Both parties have sent a group of cadres to assist the district trade union cadres in establishing these cooperatives. The primary target for establishing these cooperatives is tricycle workers. Because preparations had been underway a month prior, the establishment process has been rapid. As of the 7th, sixteen tricycle worker consumer cooperatives have been established. The members (including family members) number approximately twenty thousand, and all of them obtained grain from the grain company on the 3rd or 4th and have begun operations.
    The method of establishing the cooperatives involves the tricycle workers' union convening a joint meeting of all group leaders to explain the nature and importance of the cooperative. After hearing this, everyone was very happy and requested that the procedures be completed quickly so that they could purchase and sell food. Many people took time to transport grain to the cooperatives using their own tricycles, which allowed the cooperatives to open for business quickly. In the Fourth District, some people even requested that the government stop hoarding and expressed their willingness to assist the government in this effort.
    On the 8th, the General Cooperative convened a meeting of the working group to exchange information, set up work, and raise and resolve the following issues: 1. The cooperatives should be under the leadership of the trade union and the cooperative. 2. Regarding the housing issue for the cooperatives in four districts, it was decided that the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions would assist in finding a solution. 3. In the future, the grain company will concentrate all grain supplied to the various cooperatives at the Xuanwumen Cooperative Grain Depot for pickup, and the small-foot fee will be borne by the company. The company is also preparing to allocate the electric grinders it controls to the street cooperatives in each district. Sacks can be temporarily supplied, but members will need to provide their own in the future.
    Finally, the work for the following week was arranged: 1. Continue to intensify the work of establishing cooperatives. 2. The established cooperatives should establish formal business procedures, including establishing formal accounts, engraving seals, reporting imprints, collecting share capital, improving sales procedures, writing tickets, collecting payments, filling out member certificates, etc. 3. Strengthen the education of business personnel and members to prevent unclear procedures and the phenomenon of lending member certificates. (Zheng Zhong)

    保障三轮工人生活安定
    十六处合作社开业
    市供销总社布置本月工作
    【本报讯】为了稳定市民生活，保障劳动人民利益，市总工会与市供销合作总社，自八月份起开始建立街道合作社，并由双方派出一批干部协同各区工会干部帮助建社。建社之对象，首先是三轮工人。因一月前早有酝酿，故建立的很快，截至七日止，已建立起十六个三轮工人消费合作社。社员（家属在内）约两万余人，并都于三日或四日到粮食公司批到粮食，开始营业。
    建社方法是由三轮工会召开全体组长联席会，说明合作社的性质和重要性。大家听后都很高兴，并要求赶快办理手续，购售食粮。很多人抽出时间蹬着自己的车子去给合作社运粮，所以合作社得能很快开张营业。四区并有人要求政府制止囤积，他愿意协助政府进行这一工作。
    八日总社召集工作组开会交流情况，布置工作，提出并解决了以下几个问题：一、合作社要受工会与合作总社的领导。二、有四个区的合作社房子问题，决定由市总工会协助想法解决。三、粮食公司今后把供给各合作社的粮食均集中到宣武门合作粮库提货，小脚费改由公司负担。公司并准备把他所掌握的电磨，拨归各该区街合作社掌握。麻袋可暂时供给以后要自备。
    最后又布置下周工作：一、继续加紧建社工作。二、已成立之合作社要建立正式的业务手续。包括建立正式帐目、刻图记，报印模，征收股金，健全卖货手续，写票，收款，填社员证等。三、加强业务人员与社员的教育，防止发生手续不清及转借社员证现象。              （郑重）
