    French Invaders' Bizarre Torture Methods
    Vietnamese People's Unyielding Spirit
    Paris Dispatch: The French Catholic journal "Christ Holy Scripture Weekly" published an article on July 29th by its reporter who recently visited Vietnam, exposing the atrocities of the French army in Vietnam. The reporter described the following incident that occurred during his visit to the Di'an military base at the invitation of a French officer. The reporter wrote: "When I was looking for an ashtray, my finger touched a white, round object on the table. Out of curiosity, I looked closer and discovered it was a human skull." When the reporter questioned the officer, he replied: "This is the skull of a Vietnamese patriot. I took it and use it as a paperweight." A few days after this incident, the reporter was invited to visit the private residence of a French officer in Tokyo, who said: "In the corner of the room here is a machine that makes people talk. This machine is very useful when interrogating Vietnamese prisoners. I turn on the switch, make it contact the prisoner, and it can make the prisoner vomit blood." The officer complained: "Despite all kinds of bizarre tortures, the Vietnamese prisoners still refuse to reveal the information the French army needs." He said: "This week we captured a Vietnamese woman. Because she refused to say anything, we stripped her naked, hung her from the ceiling, and tortured her for three days, but she still didn't reveal a thing."

    侵越法军酷刑奇特
    越南人民坚贞不屈
    【新华社北平三日电】巴黎讯：七月二十九日，法国天主教的基督圣书周刊登载最近访问越南的该刊记者的文章，揭发法军在越南的暴行。记者描述在他应法国军官邀请访问堤岸军事基地期间所发生的下述事件。记者写道：“当我寻找烟灰盘时，我的手指碰到放在桌子上的白色的圆东西。我好奇地就近看这些东西时才发现它是人头骨”。该军官答复记者的所问时称：这是越南爱国者的头骨，他取来后作为压纸用的。在发生这件事的几天以后，记者受东京一位法国军官邀请拜访其私邸，该军官称：“在这里的屋角里是一架使人说话的机器。在讯问越南犯人时，这架机器非常有用。我转动开关，使它与犯人接触，就可使犯人吐血”。该军官怨诉称：尽管有各种奇特的酷刑，而越南犯人仍拒绝透露法军所需要的情报。他说：本周我们俘虏了一名越南妇女。由于她拒绝讲出任何事情，因此我们就将她脱光吊在天花板上，并施用酷刑三天，但她仍不吐露一点东西。
