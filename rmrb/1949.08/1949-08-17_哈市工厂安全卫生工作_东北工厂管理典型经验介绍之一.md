Harbin Factory Safety and Health Work
Typical Experiences in Northeast Factory Management Introduction – Part 1
The Harbin Municipal Labor Bureau has been paying attention to implementing labor protection policies and strengthening factory safety and health work, playing a significant role in ensuring worker health and safety and promoting production and construction. We are now introducing the main points for reference by management in various public and private enterprises:
    I. The Situation of Factory Safety and Health in Harbin and the Necessity of Improvement
    Before liberation, under the long-term rule of the Japanese invaders, the safety and health conditions in factories in Harbin were generally poor, and workers' lives and health lacked the necessary protection. After the establishment of the people's democratic government, due to the urgent needs of the war and the lack of management experience, safety and health equipment could not be improved in a timely and effective manner. Moreover, the number of state-owned and private factories gradually increased. Many private factories added machines and workers within their already small spaces, and the safety and health equipment was poor, resulting in unnecessary deaths and injuries, such as workers being strangled by belts. Although the workshops in public enterprises were larger, safety facilities were also poor, and management and education were not strict enough, resulting in many deaths and injuries. According to a survey, in the first five months of 1949, a total of 310 workers in public and private enterprises were injured or killed due to these reasons, accounting for 0.95% of the total number of workers in the factories where incidents occurred. Among municipal enterprise employees, the municipal enterprise employee hospital alone treated 117 patients in May, accounting for 5.06% of the total number of municipal enterprise employees. Many workers in pig bristle factories suffered from coughs and bronchitis.
    Generally, workers' health in other industries also urgently needed improvement, such as insufficient heating in winter, no ventilation equipment in summer, and workers living in upper berths that were dark and damp. According to statistics, a total of 310 workers in public and private enterprises were injured or killed due to these reasons in the first five months of 1949, accounting for 0.95% of the total number of workers in the factories where incidents occurred. Diseases among workers resulted in 117 patients admitted to the Municipal Enterprise Workers Hospital in May alone, accounting for 5.06% of the total number of municipal enterprise employees. Many workers in pig bristle factories suffered from coughs and bronchitis.
    Poor safety and health equipment had a significant impact on production. For example, a worker at the Hongtai Copper Pressing Factory was injured by a gear, resulting in a 45-day work stoppage, a loss of 135 catties of output, and a reduction of over 2 million yuan (Northeast currency) in processing fees for the owner, in addition to over 1 million yuan in wages and medical expenses. Workers at the Songhua River Pig Bristle Factory lost approximately 400 workdays per month due to illness, reducing output by 780 catties (finished and semi-finished products combined), and resulting in a profit loss of over 30 million yuan. In short, poor safety and health equipment resulted in considerable losses to workers' health and factory production. It is not yet possible to statistically compare the city's production income with the losses due to poor safety and health, but these situations alone illustrate the importance of improving safety and health work in completing economic construction tasks!
    II. How is the Work Being Carried Out?
    In the beginning, many cadres did not understand or pay attention to this work. Some believed that the factories in Harbin were not large and that production was seasonal and business was not normal, so there was no way to improve. Others retained handicraft practices, thinking that when problems were discovered, they could just encourage the workers to ask the factory owners to make changes. Based on these situations, we first conducted policy study to clear the cadres' thinking, then conducted investigation and research, and then formulated laws and regulations.
    We first started the investigation from industries with serious safety and health problems. The first step was to register injuries and deaths, and then conduct investigation and research according to the nature of the industry. We divided the work into three groups: mechanical production, factories with dust and fiber, and chemical factories. During the investigation, cadres discovered the harm that poor safety and health caused to workers and production, which stimulated their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility, and they began to seriously study this unfamiliar work. In the work, we emphasized starting from production and adhered to the principles of necessity and possibility, so that the work could be carried out more practically and reasonably.
    During the process, we paid attention to cooperating with the trade unions to dispel the idea that some workers held that there was no way to improve. We organized safety and health committees and united technicians. Public factories combined with administration, while private factories consulted with the managers and jointly studied and formulated three measures: Interim Measures for Improving Mechanical Safety in Factories, Interim Measures for Safety and Health in Chemical Industry Factories, and Interim Measures for Hygiene in Factories with Dust and Fiber. The basic improvement content in mechanical safety was to install guards on gears and belts and to prevent easily occurring dangers. These expenses were not large, and the equipment could be installed immediately as long as there were production conditions. The formulation of hygiene measures for fiber factories also underwent detailed research and calculation. For example, regarding the issue of wool washing, we spent half a month analyzing and researching the advantages and disadvantages of washing on business and the increase or decrease in output, and the value of unwashed and washed wool, before affirming the necessity of washing wool. To take care of small processing plants, it was decided that those with fewer than 30 people should switch to using carding machines. In the chemical industry, such as lead oxide factories, a thorough transformation required changing the production method, which was difficult to achieve at the time, so we only made general safety and defense equipment and made improvements based on what was possible. In order to ensure that production was not affected, it was stipulated that the measures should be implemented under the condition that there were production conditions. This not only prevented harm to workers and production and provided possible guarantees for workers' safety and health, but also promoted the development of production, in line with the spirit of benefiting both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital.
    In order to carefully study whether the three measures could be implemented and to prove whether they could prevent harm and improve production, in addition to holding labor-capital symposiums, factory director and technician symposiums, etc. for research and revision, we also cooperated with the trade unions to conduct trials in 60 factories. The Shexie Firecracker Factory tried out chemical safety and health measures, expanded the studio and drying room, separated the chemistry laboratory, packaging room, complete rod room, and warehouse, and re-improved the dormitory, kitchen, etc. Oil pan covers and skylights were installed in the workshop, two masks were issued every month, and there were also gas masks and first aid kits for preparing medicines…After these installations and improvements, the daily working hours were reduced by four hours (before the improvement, labor was twelve hours), and the output increased by 57%. The workers' production enthusiasm increased. Worker Yang Jinxiang did not eat lunch or rest at noon, and instead modified the assembly machine. In the past, it took 30 minutes to assemble one cart, but now it only takes 10 minutes. The administrative staff and the workers were happy, and the two sides cooperated to establish a safety and health committee and formulated a safety and health convention. Good results were also obtained after trials in other factories. In order to make the regulations more perfect, we also concentrated the opinions of technical experts, conducted a more scientific summarization and revision, and the experts also felt that the regulations were very practical and necessary, which also promoted the experts' enthusiasm for serving the workers.
    III. Current Main Work and Future Practices
    The actual progress of the past work is the process of combining policy, the masses, and technology. The combination of these three is the key to in-depth development of future work. Therefore, strengthening the cooperation of all parties to establish and improve the safety and health committee has become the most important current work. In the formulation of the three measures, the Labor Bureau, the Federation of Trade Unions, and the Health Bureau jointly conducted investigation and research, organized discussions, and carried out the trial implementation of the measures mainly by the Federation of Trade Unions, which achieved preliminary results. However, many cadres still lack sufficient understanding of the issue of cooperation. Some cadres placed the trade union cadres in a subordinate position in their actual work and failed to rely on the trade unions to conduct education and play a role among the workers. Some regarded the Health Bureau as a technical department. The division of labor was not clear, the relationship was not reasonable enough, and a comprehensive and specific division of labor method was not formulated. Some of these shortcomings have been noted, reviewed, and corrected in the work, and some still need to be corrected in future efforts. In the future, the division of labor and cooperation should be: the Labor Bureau and the Construction Bureau (mainly the Labor Bureau) are responsible for the inspection of labor protection, the formulation of relevant safety laws and regulations, the investigation and statistics of work-related injuries and deaths, and business guidance, etc. The Labor Bureau and the Health Bureau are jointly responsible for the formulation, inspection, and business guidance of labor hygiene laws and regulations, etc. The Trade Union is responsible for the implementation of safety and health policies and measures, promoting factory safety and health organizations, assisting in proposing plans, and conducting safety and health education, etc. In addition, we should also pay attention to uniting experts in the future to combine technology with practice, in order to better serve the safety and health work of the factory.
    In terms of work focus, we should first pay attention to state-owned enterprises (the general process in the past was problematic), conduct in-depth investigations according to the nature, continue to formulate safety and health improvement measures, pay attention to the implementation of the promulgated measures, and summarize experiences to make them systematic. In addition, strengthening the work of the Safety and Health Committee, establishing factory safety and health systems and organizations, specializing cadres, learning the theory and practice of factory safety and health, and systematically translating advanced Soviet factory safety and health experiences are all things that should be paid attention to in the development of future safety and health work.

　　哈市工厂安全卫生工作
  　东北工厂管理典型经验介绍之一
    哈尔滨市政府劳动局，注意贯彻劳动保护政策，加强工厂安全卫生工作，在保障工人健康与安全，推动生产建设上起到相当作用；今特择要介绍，供各公私营企业管理方面参考：
    一、哈市工厂安全卫生情况及改进的必要
    解放前的哈尔滨市，在日寇长期统治之下，工厂安全卫生情况普遍不好，工人生命与健康缺乏应有的保障；人民民主政府成立后，由于战争急需及经营经验的缺乏，安卫设备也未能作及时有效的改进，国营、私营工厂又日渐增多，不少私营工厂在本来狭小的厂子内增加机器与工人，安卫设备又差，致发生被皮带绞死工人等不应有的死伤事故；公营企业工房虽大点，但安全设施亦差，加以管理教育不严，死伤事故亦不少。据调查如化学工业中铅丹工厂是最易中毒的，但什么设备也没有。不少带尘土纤维工厂，一工作尘土飞扬满屋，窒息呼吸。其他行业的工人卫生，一般也急需改进。如冬季取暖不足，夏季无通风装置，工人住宿于吊铺上，阴暗、潮湿等，据统计一九四九年五个月中，公私营企业工人由此而伤亡者共三一○人，占发生事件工厂总人数的百分之○·九五。工人疾病仅市公企职工病院五月份受疗者即一一七名，占市企职工总数的百分之五·○六。猪毛工厂中不少工人患咳嗽及气管支炎等疾病。
    由于安卫设备不良，对生产有很大影响，如宏泰压铜工厂一工友被牙轮绞伤，歇工四十五天，损失产量一三五斤，业主少得加工费二百余万元（东北币，下同），另外还开支其工资及医药等费一百余万元。松花江猪毛工厂工人因病每月误工约四百个，减少产量七八○斤（成品与半成品合算），损失利润三千余万元。总之，由于安卫设备的不良，对工友健康和工厂生产的损失是相当巨大的。现在还没可能把全市生产收入与因安卫不良之损失统计对比出来，仅就这些情况看来，已说明了安全卫生工作之改进，在完成经济建设任务中是何等的重要！
    二、工作是如何进行的？
    开始不少干部对这一工作不懂、不重视，有的认为哈市工厂不大，加以生产有季候性，营业不正常，没法改进；有的则保留着手工业的做法，认为发现问题，就推动工人让厂主改就行了。根据这些情况，首先进行了政策学习，打通干部思想，接着进行调查研究，进而制订法令办法。
    首先从安全卫生问题较重的行业着手调查，第一步进行了伤亡登记，同时分别行业性质进行调查研究，按机械生产、带尘土纤维工厂、化学工厂分三组进行工作，在调查中，干部发现安卫不良对工人和生产的损害，激发了工作热情与责任心，对这一生疏的工作开始认真钻研，工作中强调从生产出发，坚持必要与可能的原则，使工作的进行比较实际与合理。
    在进行中注意和职工会配合，打通有些工人认为没法改进的思想。组织了安卫会，并团结了技师。公营工厂则和行政结合，私营方面则商得经理同意，共同研究，制订了工厂机械安全暂行改进办法、化学业工厂安全卫生暂行办法、带尘土纤维工厂卫生暂行办法等三个办法。在机械安全方面基本改进内容是装设牙轮与皮带盒子及防止易发生的危险，这些开支都不大，只要有生产条件，马上即能设备。对于纤维工厂卫生办法的制订，也经过详细的研究与计算；如洗毛问题，对营业上的利害与产量的增减，不洗的与洗过的价值，曾费了半月时间分析研究，才肯定洗毛的必要。为照顾小加工厂，决定在三十人以下者改用打毛机。化学方面，如铅丹工厂，要彻底变好，须改变生产方式，这些是当下难办到的，便只做一般安全防御设备，根据可能进行改进。为了确实不影响生产，规定在有生产条件的情况下施行，这样不仅防御了对工人及生产的损害，使工人安卫有了可能的保障，且促进了生产的发展，符合公私兼顾、劳资两利的精神。
    为了仔细研究三个办法是否能实行，证明其是否能防止损害与提高生产，除开劳资座谈会、厂长技师座谈会等研究修改外，还和工会配合在六十个工厂试行。社协火柴厂试行化学安卫办法，扩大了工作室，干燥室，将化室验、包装室、整杆室、仓库等分开，重新改进了宿舍、厨房等，工房内装设油锅罩和天窗，每月发给两个口罩，还有配药时的防毒面具、急救箱等……经过这些装设改进，每日减少了四小时工作（改进前劳动十二小时），而产量却提高了百分之五十七。工人生产情绪提高，工友杨金祥午间不吃饭不休息，改修装机，过去三十分钟装一个车子，现在十分钟即装完。行政方面和工人都高兴，双方配合成立了安全卫生委员会，订立了安卫公约。其他厂试行后，也得到良好的效果。为了办法规定的更加完善，又集中了技术专家们的意见，进行比较科学的归纳与修改，专家们也感到办法很切合实际与需要，也促进了专家为工人服务的热情。
    三、当前的主要工作与今后的做法
    过去这段工作的进行，实际即是政策与群众与技术结合的过程，三者的结合，即将来工作深入开展的关键，因此，加强各方配合成立并健全安卫会，成为当前的重要工作。在制订三个办法中，劳动局与总工会、卫生局即共同进行了调查研究，组织了讨论，又以总工会为主进行了办法的试行，曾取得初步成绩。但不少干部对配合问题还认识不足，有的在实际工作中把职工会干部放在附属地位，未能依靠职工会在工人群众中进行教育、发挥作用；对卫生局方面，有的当成一个技术部门看待；在分工上也不明确，关系也不够合理，未订出一个全面具体的分工办法，这些缺点在工作中有的已注意检讨纠正，有些还需今后努力改正。今后在分工配合上应是：劳动局与建设局（劳动局为主）负责劳动保护的检查，有关安全法令的制订及因公伤亡的调查统计，业务指导等。劳动局与卫生局共同负责劳动卫生法令的制订、检查与业务指导等。职工会负责安卫政策与措施的贯彻，推进工厂安卫组织，协助提出方案，进行安卫教育等，此外今后还应注意团结专家，使技术与实际结合，以期更好为工厂的安卫工作服务。
    在工作重点上，首先应注意公营企业（过去一般的进行是有毛病的），按性质深入调查，继续制订安卫改进办法，注意贯彻已颁布之办法，总结经验，使之条理化。此外，加强安全卫生委员会工作，建立工厂安卫制度及组织，干部专门化，学习工厂安全卫生的理论与实际，有计划的译述苏联的工厂安全卫生的先进经验等，都是今后安卫工作开展中应加注意的。
