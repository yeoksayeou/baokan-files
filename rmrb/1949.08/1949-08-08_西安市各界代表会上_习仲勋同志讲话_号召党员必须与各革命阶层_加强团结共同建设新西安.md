Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 7th: Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, spoke at the Xi'an Municipal People's Representatives Conference on July 28th. He emphasized that in order to build a new Xi'an for the people, it is necessary to unite all strata and classes that support the New Democratic Revolution to form a broad united front. Today's conference of people's representatives from all walks of life is precisely the beginning of this unity. He said: Communist Party members must resolutely stand firm on the position of the broad masses of the people and unite the broad masses and people from all walks of life who approve of the people's democratic dictatorship. In carrying out the work of unity, Communist Party members must never consider themselves special and become divorced from the masses; Communist Party members only have the obligation to practice democratic cooperation with non-Party members, and do not have the right to exclude others or monopolize everything. This principle must be conscientiously observed. He then pointed out: Building a new Xi'an for the people must be coordinated with the vast countryside. Today, Xi'an is basically not a producing city, but a consuming city. Xi'an cannot yet supply the countryside with a large amount of products, and the rural peasants do not yet have the strength to purchase a large amount of urban products, while the urban production raw materials and means of livelihood completely rely on the countryside to solve, and 90% of the manpower and material resources supporting the war at the front are also taken from the countryside. Therefore, it is necessary to actively carry out social reforms and democratic reforms in the countryside while building the city, so as to provide sufficient conditions for the construction and development of urban industrial production. He hopes that urban staff, workers and young students will go to the countryside in large numbers to work. In addition, he called on representatives from all walks of life attending the meeting to draw a clear line between revolution and counter-revolution, assist the Military Control Commission and the Municipal People's Government, and strive to eliminate special agents, bandits and other Kuomintang remnant forces, restore and develop production, and support the front.

    西安市各界代表会上
    习仲勋同志讲话
    号召党员必须与各革命阶层
    加强团结共同建设新西安
    【新华社西安七日电】中共中央西北局书记习仲勋于七月二十八日出席西安市各界代表会讲话。他着重说明：为了建设人民的新西安，必须团结拥护新民主主义革命的各阶层、各阶级，组成广泛的统一战线。今天的各界代表会议，就正是这个团结的开端。他说：共产党员们，必须坚决站稳人民大众的立场，团结广大群众和一切赞成人民民主专政的各界人士。在进行团结的工作中，共产党员决不能自视特殊，脱离群众；共产党员只有和党外人士实行民主合作的义务，而没有排斥别人、垄断一切的权利。这一条原则，必须切实遵守。他接着指出：建设人民的新西安必须和广大农村配合起来。今天西安市基本上还不是一个生产的城市，而是一个消费的城市。西安还不能以大量的生产品供给乡村，乡村农民也还没有力量购买城市的大量生产品，而城市生产原料和生活资料，则完全要依靠乡村来解决，前方支援战争的人力物力，亦百分之九十取之于乡村。因此，必须与建设城市同时，积极地进行农村中的社会改革和民主改革，才能使建设和发展城市的工业生产具有充分的条件。他希望城市中的工作人员、青年学生，大批地到农村中去工作。此外，他号召到会各界代表，划清革命与反革命的界线，协助军管会和市人民政府，努力肃清特务、散匪等国民党残余力量，恢复与发展生产，支援前线。
