    Marching into the Great Northwest
    Xu Gongchen
    I. Heroes Prepare to Depart
    "March into the Great Northwest, eliminate the bandit Hu Ma, and liberate the people of the Great Northwest!" has become the slogan of all commanders and fighters of the First Battalion of the 559th Regiment. Everyone is lightening their loads and preparing for a long-distance march. Each person has set a marching plan. Platoons, squads, and companies have written conditions for meritorious service, implementing the Three Nos Movement (no desertion, no falling behind, no seeking medical attention) and the Three Nos Leaving Movement (no leaving without returning borrowed items, no leaving without filling the water tank, no leaving without cleaning the courtyard), as well as mutual assistance in physical strength and ideology. Everyone is excited, making mutual guarantees and challenging each other. The Third Machine Gun Squad of the First Company challenged the regimental leaders, who responded with a letter of acceptance and presented each member of the squad with a red flower to wear on their chest. Everyone also proposed the slogan: "Say it, do it, compare it to Xi'an," and their enthusiasm was extremely high.
    II. Two Great Mountains, Seventy Li
    Didi Da! A… The assembly call sounded, and the Third Company assembled completely in three minutes. In the quiet night, the complex starlight served as companions, and there was no sound other than the rustling of footsteps. The company was the rear guard of the entire regiment. Like a steel torrent, the company raced along the winding mountain path. Turning past the foothills, the first high mountain, forty li in length, was already in front of them. As the starlight gradually faded, the east had gradually turned white. At this time, the vanguard had reached the summit, and the rear guard was still halfway up the mountain. The soldiers sang self-composed songs with great joy: "Climbing one mountain after another, the mountains are connected endlessly, ah yo, when we get to the Great Northwest, we will make great achievements!" In an instant, the entire company launched a great mutual assistance movement. Comrade Gao Genyin, the political instructor, was strong and tall, and his physique seemed even more majestic. Although he was blind in his left eye, his right eye sparkled with brilliance. He was full of energy, young, and handsome. His four treasures never left his side: a machine gun, a backpack, a marching pot, and an oil barrel. They all took turns appearing on his shoulders, and everyone scrambled to grab them, launching a battle of possession. Each squad put forward the slogan that the gun should not leave the squad. There were too many "double-gun generals." Comrade Zhang Genzhong, affectionately called "Little Devil of the Eighth Squad" by the whole company, was weak and small, but he still carried a fifteen-jin explosive barrel. Occasionally, when he was not paying attention, it was snatched away by someone else. He chased after it, trying to grab it back. When he failed to get it back, he cried anxiously, saying, "My credit has been taken away by him!" Comrade Lu Wanlin of the Ninth Squad, a soldier who had not recovered from a long illness, did not eat all day, but still carried his own belongings and persisted in marching, without falling behind. Everyone forgot their fatigue and conquered the scorching sun. The second high mountain, thirty li in length, was also quickly traversed under their feet. Far away, they could see the city of Huoxian suspended at the end of the winding downward slope. The twinkling starlight accompanied the victors of the one-hundred-and-twenty-li journey, and they entered the campsite with excited and joyful songs.
  III. Passing Through Jishan and Hejin Counties
    To the majestic sounds of military music and loud singing, the valiant soldiers marched in rows through the streets. Huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu were hung on the city walls. Comfort stations were one after another. Various music groups, yangge teams, stilt walkers, etc., were twisting, singing, and performing Qin operas, with gongs and drums shaking the sky and colorful flowers flying. Old ladies in their seventies, holding wet towels, wiped the sweat and dust from the faces of the soldiers. Eleven-year-old girls held eggs and cigarettes in their hands, giving them to each soldier, one by one. Towels, comfort bags, and other items filled the streets. Hot water was arranged on both sides. Old ladies and young women welcomed the troops in groups, calling out affectionately, "Comrades, have a bowl of water!" They brought bowls of hot water to the hands of the soldiers, and everywhere was filled with revolutionary fervor. Red and green slogans and couplets were pasted all over the streets: "Welcome the westward march of the great army," "Real heroes who have fought all over North China," "Transfer to the Northwest to make more contributions"… "This touched everyone's hearts, and everyone shouted the same slogans: "Resolutely implement the orders of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!" "Liberate the Great Northwest and eliminate the bandit Hu Ma!" "We will answer the people with practical actions!"
  IV. Crossing the Perilous Yellow River
    "Look! The Yellow River is ahead, it's truly a natural barrier!" Everyone shouted excitedly!
    From afar, they heard the surging river water, rushing and roaring like thousands of troops and horses. The long-awaited Yellow River was about to be crossed this afternoon. To the sound of loud singing, the troops boarded the boats quickly and in an orderly manner. The river crossing was very narrow, no more than one or two hundred meters wide at its widest point. The water flowed from the mountains to the plains, cascading down for miles, creating a dangerous situation. According to experienced boatmen, "The water is nine li and thirteen zhang deep." An old boatman with white hair, over seventy years old, steered the rudder steadily. Dark and strong boatmen used all their strength to tightly row the oars, battling the raging Yellow River with shouts of "Hey yo! Row yo! Hey yo! Row yo!" With unprecedented speed, they safely transported the troops across the river.
    We landed ashore, and it was not even dusk yet, but this was already the boatmen's ninth transfer.
  V. Farewell! Fathers and Elders of Heyang
    The setting sun shone on the faces of every soldier. The communicator was shouting: "There are still eight li to the campsite, and we will pass through Heyang City soon!" Fellow villagers, students, and local cadres all came out more than three li to welcome the troops, grabbing marching pots, oil barrels, machine guns, and small cannons. The wife of the county party secretary grabbed a marching pot; eleven-year-old Du Juan grabbed a soldier's submachine gun, looked at it curiously, and carried it on her shoulder; the villagers untied the heavy machine guns from the mules and carried them on their shoulders. Buckets of hot water were brought over, and the people stood on both sides of the city gate, with yangge and flower drums twisted into a ball. Newly presented red flags of "People's Heroes" and "Invincible in Every Battle" fluttered in front of the team. Cooks with flowers pinned all over their bodies gave "hundred-li steamed buns" made of more than one jin of high-quality white flour to the soldiers. The welcoming crowd followed all the way to the campsite—Guanzhuang.
    When departing from Guanzhuang, the yangge team and floats of the villagers of Guanzhuang escorted them for another ten li. They were about to cross a gully, and the people at the bottom of the Jinshui Gully, about eight li up and down, had been waiting to welcome them and gave fruit to each soldier. Women grabbed the soldiers' belongings and carried them up the hillside. Li Jianmin, fourteen years old from Lijiawa, and Huang Bingcai, twelve years old from Qilizhuang, both carried machine guns. Dai Baoxiang, a fifty-three-year-old from Beilifang, carried a marching pot all the way to the top of the slope. Everyone was as close as family, chatting happily. When they went uphill, the soldiers grabbed the belongings, and the villagers watched the neat ranks reluctantly.
    The enthusiasm of the villagers moved everyone to tears—it flowed to the depths of their hearts and solidified into strength! It will accelerate the enemy's demise.
  VI. Deputy Regiment Commander and Chief of Staff Compete
    The scorching sun made every soldier sweat profusely, and their clothes were soaked. Deputy Regiment Commander Deng Shijun and Chief of Staff Zhang Runchen arrived at the machine gun and artillery transport and rushed to carry the things that the soldiers were carrying. However, in order to take care of the leaders' fatigue, none of the soldiers wanted to give it to them. After a long struggle, the deputy regimental commander grabbed a 60mm mortar and added a rifle; the chief of staff grabbed the heavy machine gun body. The two competed against each other for thirty li and only handed it over to the soldiers when they reached the campsite. All the officers and soldiers launched a movement to learn from Deng and Zhang's mutual assistance.
  VII. Preparation for Battle
    On the sixteenth day of the march, the soldiers learned how to reduce fatigue and prevent blisters on their feet while marching. Everyone collectively composed a marching rhyme, and everyone was humming it: "Swing your arms, lean your body forward, take big steps, put your feet flat, step firmly, don't step in the air, keep the pace steady, follow closely without being too fast or too slow, soak your feet first at the campsite, and keep your shoes and socks clean."
    The long march of more than one thousand and two hundred li has successfully reached the assembly point. The Third Company had no sick people and no one fell behind, and many heroes emerged. Qin Zhongli's light machine gun never left his shoulder, fulfilling his promise. A total of more than forty jin of weight was carried to the Great Northwest. After everyone excitedly evaluated and rewarded meritorious service, they began to prepare to enter battle. They all cleaned their guns and sharpened their knives, determined to make contributions in the battle!

    挺进大西北
    徐拱辰
    一、英雄们整装待发
    “进军大西北，消灭胡马匪，解放大西北人民。”已成为五五九团一营全体指战员的口号。大家都在进行轻装，准备长途的大进军，每个人都定了行军计划。班排连都写了立功条件，实行三不运动（不逃亡、不掉队、不病医），三不走运动（借东西不还清不走、水不满缸不走、院子不扫净不走）及体力与思想互助。人人兴高采烈地互相保证互相挑战，一连三机枪班与团首长挑战，团首长亦复了应战书，并赠给了全班每人一朵红花，缀在胸前，大家并提出了：“说到，作到，西安对照”的口号，情绪异常高涨。
    二、两座大山七十里
    的的＠哒！＠………集合号响了，三连三分钟集合齐了。在寂静的深夜，繁杂的星光作着伴侣，除了沙沙的脚步声外，再没有别的音响了。该连是全团的后卫，钢铁般的队伍，沿着蜿蜓的山道飞也似的奔驰着，转过了山麓，第一座四十里地的高山已在面前，随着星光的逐渐消逝，东方已渐渐发白，这时前卫已到达山顶，后卫还在半山腰中，战士们兴高采烈地唱着自编的歌曲：“爬一山又一山，山山接连，老不断，哎唉哟，到了那大西北立个大功劳！”刹那间全连展开了大互助运动，政指高根银同志强壮的身体，高高的个子，越显得体格魁伟，虽然左眼失明，但他的右眼却晶莹的闪着光，精神饱满年青英俊，他四件宝贝不离身，机枪、背包、行军锅、油担子，都轮流的出现在他的肩上，每个人都争先恐后的抢夺着，展开了争夺战，每班都提出了枪不出班的口号，“双枪将”的英雄太多了，全连呼为“八班的小鬼”张根忠同志，虽然身体衷弱，个子矮小，但他还背着十五斤的爆破筒，偶而不注意被别人抢去了，他在追着抢夺，因没抢到手，急的哭着嚷：“我的功劳被他夺去了！”九班久病未愈的战士卢万林同志，一天没有吃饭，仍然背着自己的东西坚持行军，没有掉队，大家都忘记了疲劳，征服了炎夏的烈日。第二座三十里的高山也飞速的从脚下驰过，远远的望见霍县城已悬挂在曲折的下坡道的尽头，闪闪的星光又在伴随着一百二十里行程的胜利者，于兴奋愉快的歌声中进入宿营地。
  三、穿过稷山河津县城
    在雄壮的军乐与宏亮的歌声中，雄纠纠的战士们，一队队的从街上通过，城头上悬挂着毛主席朱总司令的巨幅画像，慰问棚一个紧接一个，各种音乐组、秧歌队、高跷等等，都在扭着，唱着，演秦着，锣鼓喧天，彩花纷飞，七十多岁的老太太，拿着湿手巾，替战士们擦着脸上的汗水和尘土，十一岁的小女孩手里拿着鸡蛋纸烟，一个个一支支的送给每个战士，手巾慰问袋等物品摆满了街，开水都排列在两旁，老太太青年妇女结队欢迎，亲切的叫着：“同志们喝碗水吧！”将开水一碗碗的送到战士们的手中，到处都充满了革命的热爱，红绿彩色的标语对联贴满了街：“欢迎西进大军”、“打遍华北真英雄”、“转战西北再立功”……“这感动了每个人的心，大家喊出一致的口号：“坚决执行毛主席朱总司令的命令！”“解放大西北消灭胡马匪！”“我们要拿实际行动来回答人民！”
  四、渡过天险的黄河
    “你瞧！前面就是黄河，真是天险呵！”大家都兴奋的跳起来嚷着！
    远远听到汹涌澎湃的河水，象千军万马般奔腾着，呼号着，盼望很久的黄河，今日下午即要开始渡过，在宏亮的歌声中，队伍迅速而有秩序的上了船。渡口河幅很窄，最宽不过一、二百米远，水从山口注向平原，一泻千里，形势险恶，据有经验的船工谈：“水深九里十三丈”。白发苍苍七十余岁的老船手稳把着舵；黝黑而健壮的船工们，用尽了平生的气力紧摇着双桨，在“嘿哟！划哟！嘿哟！划哟！”的喊声中，与惊涛骇浪的黄水搏斗着，以空前惊人的速度，把部队安全的运过了河。
    我们登岸了，天还不到黄昏，然而这已是船工们第九次的转运了。
  五、别了！ｈé＠②阳的父老
    夕阳斜射在每个战士的脸上，通讯员在喊着：“离宿营地还有八里，快过ｈé＠②阳城了！”老乡、学生及地方干部同志们，都走出三里多地来迎接部队，抢着背行军锅，担油挑子，扛机枪小炮，县委书记的女人抢着背起了行军锅；十一岁的小女孩杜娟，抢过战士的冲锋枪好奇的看了几眼，背在肩上；老乡们都把捆在驮骡上的重机枪解下背在肩上。开水一担一担的送过来，城关上，人民站满了两旁，秧歌花鼓等等扭成一团，新献的“人民功臣”，“百战百胜”的红旗飘荡在队前，炊事员身上插满了花，将一斤多重的上等白面作成“百里馒头”，赠给战士，欢迎的人群一直跟到了宿营地——官庄。
    打官庄出发时，官庄老乡的秧歌队及花车又结队送出了十里地。快翻沟了，这金水沟上下约八里地，沟底下的群众，早已等待着欢迎，将水果都送给了每个战士，妇女们抢下战士们的东西，背上山坡。李家洼十四岁的李建民及七里庄十二岁的黄炳才，都扛着机枪，北里坊五十三岁的老大伯戴宝祥背着行军锅一直送到了坡上，大家亲如一家，快乐的畅谈着。上坡了，战士们抢过东西来，老乡们还依依不舍的望着整齐的行列。
    老乡们的热情，使大家都感动的流出了热泪——它流向心的深处，凝成了力量！它将加速敌人的灭亡。
  六、副团长与参谋长竞赛
    火烧似的太阳晒的每个战士都流出了热汗，衣服都湿透了。副团长邓什钧同志与参谋长张润臣同志到了机炮运抢着要背战士们背的东西，可是战士们为了照顾首长的疲劳，谁也不愿意给他们，争夺了很久，副团长抢过了六○炮，又加上了一支步枪；参谋长抢过了重机枪身，两个人互相竞赛的走了三十里，到达宿营地时，才交给了战士。全体干部战士都展开了学习邓张的互助运动。
  七、战斗的准备
    十六日的行军，战士们都学会了怎样在行军中减轻疲劳与使脚不打泡，大家集体编了个行军诀歌，每个人都在哼哼的念着：“臂甩开，体前倾，迈大步，脚放平，踏实地，不蹬空，步度要拿稳，不快不慢紧跟行，宿营先烫脚，鞋袜经常要干净。”
    一千二百余里的长途行军，已胜利的到达了集结地点，三连无一病号，无一掉队，出现了许多功臣；秦中利的轻机枪始终没脱离自己的肩上，实行了自己的诺言，一共四十余斤的重量背到了大西北，大家兴奋的评功奖功后，已开始准备进入战斗，都擦枪磨刀，决心在战斗中立功！
