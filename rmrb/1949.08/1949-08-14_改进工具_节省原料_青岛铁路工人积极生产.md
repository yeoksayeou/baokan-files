    Improving Tools, Saving Materials
    Qingdao Railway Workers Actively Produce
    [Qingdao News] After liberation, Qingdao railway workers are engaging in production with the attitude of masters. In the early days of Qingdao's liberation, workers from various sections organized a repair team of 1,200 people, who cooperated with the engineering section and jointly completed the huge task of repairing the Jiaoji Railway. In the second half of July, the locomotive depot transported 2,455 tons of coal. Two hundred and twenty-eight crew members, preferring to forgo their own rest, helped the coal unloading workers unload the coal together overnight, ensuring the timely use of the wagons. The 96 employees of the Wharf Station used two and a half days to repair the 400-meter-long departure line, which had three tracks, that had been damaged during the Kuomintang rule, ensuring convenient transportation. They have also made great strides in tapping creativity and saving raw materials and equipment.
