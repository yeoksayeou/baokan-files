　　Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, August 24th: When a unit of the People's Liberation Army arrived in Chairman Mao's hometown—Xiangtan—it was warmly welcomed by people of all strata in the area. Before Xiangtan was liberated, the local workers and farmers had prepared hundreds of thousands of catties of rice and firewood to be used when the People's Liberation Army arrived. As soon as the People's Liberation Army reached the east bank of the Xiang River, the local dockworkers and boatmen rushed from several miles away to help the troops cross the river. The workers tirelessly rowed more than twenty small boats, quickly ferrying a regiment across the Xiang River within two hours. Many primary and secondary school teachers and students gathered spontaneously in groups of three or five, performing Yangko dances on the riverbank and streets, shouting slogans, and singing songs such as "People's saviors, the People's Liberation Army, you have worked hard!..." Merchants who had been fleeing to the countryside during the day to avoid air raid alerts rushed back to boil tea and set off firecrackers, cheering from both sides of the road as soon as they heard that the People's Liberation Army had arrived. Even after the troops had settled into their encampments, many representatives from groups and schools traveled from afar to the encampments to offer their condolences.

　　解放军到了毛主席故乡
  　湘潭人民帮渡湘江
    【新华社长沙二十四日电】当人民解放军某部到达毛主席故乡——湘潭时，受到该地各阶层人民热烈欢迎。在湘潭还没有解放之前，当地的工人和农民就准备好了几十万斤大米、柴草，以便给解放军来时应用。解放军刚一到湘江东岸，当地的码头工人、船工就从数里外赶来，帮助部队渡江。工人们不怕疲劳地连续划着二十余只小划子，在两小时内，即将一个团迅速渡过湘江。许多中、小学教师和学生，三五成群地自动集合起来，在江边上、大街上扭着秧歌，喊着口号，唱着“人民的救星解放军，你们辛苦了！……”的歌子。商民白天跑到乡间去躲警报，但一听到解放军来了，都纷纷赶回来烧茶水、放鞭炮，夹道欢呼。直到部队宿营后，还有许多团体、学校的代表，从远处跑到宿营处慰问。
