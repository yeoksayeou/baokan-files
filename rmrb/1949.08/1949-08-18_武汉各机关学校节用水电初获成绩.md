　　[Hankou News] Wuhan's government organs and schools have achieved initial success in conserving water and electricity. The Wuchang Office of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government used 13 gallons of water per person per day in June, which was reduced to 9 gallons in July. The plan is to repair the wells in the courtyard, which can reduce water usage by a quarter. In terms of electricity consumption, 63 light bulbs consumed more than 1,000 kilowatt-hours in June, now reduced to 25 bulbs consuming only 86 kilowatt-hours, a savings of 12 times compared to June. The Social Affairs Department of the Central China Bureau removed 116 unnecessary light bulbs and replaced 77 large light bulbs with small ones in the seven days from the 28th of last month to the 3rd of this month. It is estimated that 65,400+ yuan in electricity costs can be saved in July. In terms of water consumption, three wells have now been drilled and 34 faucets removed. After the Central China University paid attention to water and electricity management, it can save more than 1 million yuan in water and electricity costs per month. The Central China Grain Bureau reduced the number of light bulbs from 82 to 41; water consumption decreased from 100,000 gallons to 36,000 gallons, saving 220,000 yuan in water and electricity costs.
