　　The Struggle Between the New and the Old in Soviet Social Conditions (Part 1)
    By Fu Yue-duo-luo-fu
    Editor's Note: This journal previously discussed the driving force of social development, including the debate on the driving force of socialist social development. The issue has long been resolved in the Soviet Union. This article is published for research and reference.
    Soviet society grew up on the basis of the October Socialist Revolution. In the thirty years since its birth, the Soviet state has defeated the old world. This victory is of worldwide historical significance and marks the greatest turning point in world history. However, we cannot yet say that all remnants of the old have been completely eliminated. To further advance victoriously, Soviet society must wage a tireless struggle against these remnants, resolutely overcome and eradicate them. The struggle between the new and the old, between development and decay, to overcome the old and ensure the victory of the new, has been and remains the law of development of Soviet society.
    The contradiction between the new and the old, between development and dying, is the general law of the development of nature and society. Under the bourgeois system, society is divided into antagonistic classes, and the contradiction between the new and the old takes the form of antagonistic struggle. In socialist societies without antagonistic contradictions, the forms of the struggle between the new and the old are fundamentally different. The form of this struggle has also changed in the course of the development of Soviet society. The way of new and old struggle, which was once a characteristic of the first stage of the Soviet state when mutually antagonistic classes still existed, has undergone essential changes after the elimination of the exploiting classes. At this time, our country formed a socialist society composed purely of laborers—workers, peasants, and Soviet intellectuals.
    As a result of the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the rule of landlords and capitalists was overthrown, and the dictatorship of the proletariat was declared. After this, the struggle against the overthrown exploiting classes not only did not stop, but also took on a sharper and more cruel nature.
    When resisting the socialist offensive, capitalists and landlords tried their best to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore their rule. They launched a civil war against the workers and peasants and united with foreign invaders who carried out armed intervention against the Soviet state.
    The overthrown exploiting classes adopted a variety of struggle methods: sabotage, disruption, terrorist means, poisoning, and destroying grain requisition to create domestic famine, etc.
    The bourgeoisie tried its best to use the inherent wavering tendencies of the petty bourgeoisie due to its duality, attracting the petty bourgeoisie masses to its side to organize counter-revolution and restore capitalism. The reason why the bourgeoisie had hope for the restoration of capitalism was because, even after being overthrown, it was still stronger than the proletariat that overthrew it. Its strength first "lies in the power of international capital, and also in the power of consolidated international connections" (Lenin). The bourgeoisie has more money (often important movable property), organizational skills (especially in trade and military affairs), and the support of some reactionary intellectuals. The strength of the bourgeoisie also lies in the force of habit and in the strength of small production, which constantly and daily generates capitalism and the bourgeoisie.
    The dictatorship of the proletariat appeared as a sharp and powerful tool for using direct violence against the overthrown exploiting classes. As a result of the Soviet regime's victory over domestic counter-revolution and foreign armed intervention, the success of the all-out socialist offensive, the victory of the national industrialization policy, and the elimination of the rich peasants as a class on the basis of comprehensive collectivization, the bourgeois forces in Soviet society were crushed, and socialism triumphed.
    The reason why the bourgeoisie, especially the rural bourgeoisie (rich peasants), could be defeated at that time was because, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, a consolidated alliance of the proletariat and the laboring peasants, who accounted for the vast majority of the national population, was cultivated. This alliance is a tool for fighting against the forces and traditions of the old society, and for enabling the masses of laboring peasants to participate in socialist construction.
    There were certain contradictions between the proletariat and the laboring peasants. These contradictions arose because the proletariat was the most thoroughly revolutionary class, while the peasants were then a force that wavered between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. However, the contradiction between the proletariat and the peasants is completely different from the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. This is not an antagonistic contradiction, because on the other hand, there is also a commonality of fundamental interests between the proletariat and the peasants, and they are equally interested in the socialist road of national economic development and the victory of socialism. This commonality of fundamental interests outweighed the existing contradictions and became the foundation of the worker-peasant alliance.
    In his notes on the dictatorship of the proletariat in 1919-1920, Lenin pointed out that in Soviet society, in addition to the class struggle form of "suppressing the resistance of the exploiters (and any recurrence and restoration of capitalism and its traditions)," there was another form of struggle, which is "systematic and guided influence (this is also struggle, but a special kind of struggle; it is also the overcoming of some resistance that is indeed completely different, and it is also a completely different overcoming)"—influence on the non-proletarian laboring masses (see Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 3, p. 494).
    The dictatorship of the proletariat does not appear to the laboring peasants as a tool of violence, but as a means of exerting systematic and guided state influence on the peasant masses, with the aim of separating them from the bourgeoisie, consolidating the alliance of the proletariat and the laboring peasant masses under the leadership of the proletariat, and enabling the peasant masses to participate in the cause of socialist construction.
    In the relationship between the working class and the peasants, the basic forms of the struggle between the new and the old are as follows: the working class provides political leadership to the peasants in the struggle between the peasants and the rich peasants; provides the peasants with organized material assistance in the cause of establishing and consolidating collective farms; conducts political education for the peasants and convinces them of the superiority of the socialist economy; opposes the peasants' private mentality, fatigue, and fear of taking the unfamiliar and unknown new road that the working class guides the peasants to take.
    Using bourgeois intellectuals and attracting them to participate in the cause of socialist construction is also a special form of the struggle between the new and the old. Repressive measures were adopted against those strata of bourgeois intellectuals who opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat. These strata were defeated and crushed by the organs of the Soviet regime. However, there was also a larger number of intellectuals who, after a long period of hesitation and waiting for "better times," finally decided to reconcile with the Soviet regime. The basic form of the struggle between the new and the old in the thinking and psychology of this part of the old intellectuals is to transform them in the process of making them participate in socialist construction.
    The struggle to carry out new discipline education in the working class was a special form of the struggle between the new and the old during the period of socialist construction. Lenin wrote that in the transitional era from capitalism to socialism, the class struggle lies in protecting the interests of the working class and opposing such a small group of workers who stubbornly adhere to the traditions (habits) of capitalism and continue to treat the Soviet state in the same old way: working less and worse for "it" (referring to the state—translator) and getting more money from "it" (see Lenin's Complete Works, Vol. 23, p. 213). It is precisely in the struggle for the victory of the socialist revolution and for socialist construction that the proletariat is carrying out a great training to cleanse itself of the old social vices.

　　苏维埃社会条件下的新旧斗争（上）
    夫约多洛夫作
    编者按：本刊前此讨论社会发展底动力问题，其中关于社会主义社会发展底动力问题的争论，在苏联早已获得解决，特发表此文，以供研究参考。
    苏维埃社会是在十月社会主义革命的基础上成长起来的。苏维埃国家在它出世以来的三十年间，战胜了旧世界。这一胜利是具有全世界历史意义的，并且标明了全世界历史上最伟大的转折点。然而我们还不能说，一切旧东西的残余都已完全肃清了。苏维埃社会要进一步胜利地前进，必须对这种残余进行不倦的斗争，坚决地予以克服和根绝。为了克服旧东西并且保证新东西获得胜利而进行的新旧斗争，过去曾是、现在仍然还是苏维埃社会的发展规律。
    新旧之间、发展与垂死之间的矛盾，乃是自然与社会的发展的总规律。在资产阶级制度下，社会分裂为各相互敌对的阶级，新旧矛盾采取着敌对斗争的形式。在没有敌对矛盾的社会主义社会里，新旧斗争的形式便有原则上的不同。这一斗争的形式，在苏维埃社会的发展进程中也是有过变化的，在相互敌对的各个阶级还存在的时候曾经作为苏维埃国家第一阶段的特性的新旧斗争方式，在肃清了剥削阶级以后，起了本质的变化。这时候，我们的国家形成了纯粹由劳动者——工人、农民与苏维埃知识分子——组成的社会主义社会。
    伟大十月社会主义革命胜利的结果，地主与资本家的统治被推翻了，无产阶级专政宣告建立，在这以后，反对已被推翻的各剥削阶级的斗争，不仅没有停止，而且具有了更尖锐与更残酷的性质。
    资本家与地主在抵抗社会主义进攻的时候，无论如何，总想千方百计推翻无产阶级专政，恢复自己的统治。他们对工农发动了内战，并联合了对苏维埃国家采取武装干涉的外国侵略者。
    被推翻了的各剥削阶级，采用了五花八门的斗争方法：破坏，捣乱，恐怖手段，毒害，破坏征粮以制造国内饥荒等等。
    资产阶级竭力利用小资产阶级由于有双重性而固有的摇摆倾向，吸引小资产阶级群众到自己方面去组织反革命与恢复资本主义。资产阶级之所以对恢复资本主义抱有希望，是因为它就是在被推翻以后，仍然还比推翻它的无产阶级有力量些。它的力量首先“在于国际资本的力量中，也在于国际联系巩固的力量中”（列宁）。资产阶级有较多的钱财（常当是重要的动产），有组织技巧（特别是在贸易方面与军事方面），有一部分反动的知识分子的支持。资产阶级的力量也在于习惯力量中，在于小生产的力量中，这种小生产经常地每天地产生着资本主义与资产阶级。
    无产阶级专政，作为用直接暴力反对被推翻的剥削阶级的锐利与强有力的工具而出现了。苏维埃政权战胜国内反革命与外国武装干涉的结果，全线展开社会主义攻势的获得成功，国家工业化政策的获得胜利以及在全面集体化基础上消灭富农之为阶级的结果，苏维埃社会里的资产阶级力量被粉碎了，社会主义胜利了。
    当时之所以能战胜资产阶级，尤其是农村资产阶级（富农），是由于在布尔什维克党的领导下锻炼出了无产阶级与占全国人口绝大多数的劳动农民的巩固联盟。这一联盟是反对旧社会力量与传统的斗争形式，是使劳动农民群众参加社会主义建设的工具。
    在无产阶级与劳动农民之间，曾经存在着某些矛盾，这种矛盾之产生，是因为无产阶级是最彻底革命的阶级，而农民当时却还是摇摆于资产阶级与无产阶级之间的一种力量。但无产阶级与农民之间的这种矛盾，和无产阶级与资产阶级之间的矛盾是完全不同的。这不是敌对的矛盾，因为另一方面还存在着无产阶级与农民的根本利益的共同性，并且他们同样对国民经济发展的社会主义道路以及对社会主义的胜利发生兴趣。这一根本利益的共同性，在比重上赛过了已有的矛盾，成了工农联盟的基础。
    列宁在论一九一九年至一九二○年无产阶级专政的笔记中指出，在苏维埃社会里除了“镇压剥削者的抵抗（以及资本主义及其传统的任何复发与恢复）”的阶级斗争形式以外，还出现了另一种斗争形式，这就是“有步骤与有领导的影响（这也是斗争，但是特殊种类的斗争；也是对于某种的确是完全另一种抵抗的克服，并且也是完全另一种克服）”——对非无产阶级的劳动群众的影响（见列宁文集第三卷第四九四页）。
    无产阶级专政之对于劳动农民，并不是作为一种暴力的工具而出现的，而是作为对农民群众施以有步骤与有领导的国家影响的手段，其目的在使他们脱离资产阶级，巩固无产阶级领导下的无产阶级与劳动农民群众的联盟，使农民群众参加社会主义建设的事业。
    在工人阶级与农民之间的关系上，新旧斗争的基本形式如下：工人阶级在农民与富农的斗争中对农民进行政治领导；在创立及巩固集体农庄的事业上给予农民以有组织的物质援助；对农民进行政治教育并且使他们确信社会主义经济的优越性；反对农民的私有心理，疲塌以及怕走工人阶级引导农民走的未被走过不被知道的新路的恐惧情绪。
    使用资产阶级知识分子，吸引他们参加社会主义建设的事业，也是新旧斗争的一种特殊形式。对于资产阶级知识分子中反对无产阶级专政的那些阶层，曾采用了镇压措施。这些阶层被苏维埃政权的各机关击败和击溃了。但是，还有一部分人数较多的知识分子，在长时期逡巡不前与等待“好时光”后，终于决心与苏维埃政权和洽共处了。在这一部分旧知识分子的思想与心理上新旧斗争的基本形式是在使他们参加社会主义建设的过程中改造他们。
    在工人阶级中进行新的纪律教育的斗争，曾是社会主义建设时期新旧斗争的一种特殊形式。列宁写道，在从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时代中，阶级斗争便在于保护工人阶级的利益而反对这样一小群工人，他们顽强地固守资本主义的传统（习惯），继续照旧的一套对待苏维埃国家：为“它”（指国家——译）工作得少些和坏些，从“它”那里多捞些钱（见列宁全集第二十三卷第二一三页）。正是在为社会主义革命胜利与为社会主义建设的斗争中，无产阶级进行着自我清除旧社会恶习的伟大训练。  　　　　（未完）
