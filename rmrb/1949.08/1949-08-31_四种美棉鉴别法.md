Four Methods for Identifying American Cotton
    Shu Lianying
    Tuozhi cotton, also known as Tuolisi cotton, Jinzi cotton, also known as Jinshi cotton, and Sizi cotton, also known as Sitongweier cotton, these three types of cotton have been successively imported into North China. In particular, Sizi cotton includes two sibling varieties, Sizi No. 4 and Sizi No. 2, both of which have attracted great attention. Tuozhi cotton was a variety promoted and popularized in North China after 1919 through incentives. Jinzi cotton is an original American variety, brought from Korea by the Japanese. In 1917, the Japanese promoted its cultivation in Shijiazhuang and Yuhe District in Hebei Province, and along the Jiaoji Railway in Shandong Province. In 1919, Shanxi Province also purchased and promoted it. Sizi No. 4 cotton was imported from the United States after 1936 to replace Tuozhi cotton and Jinzi cotton. With the continued encouragement during the Japanese puppet regime, its acreage expanded and gradually became dominant. Sizi No. 2 cotton was imported and promoted from the United States in 1947, and its differences from its sibling Sizi No. 4 are very small. The further back the import dates of these varieties, the more mixed and degenerated the seeds become. To eliminate impurities and maintain purity, we must first understand the identification methods for these four American cotton varieties.
    (I) Morphology and Characteristics of Four American Cotton Varieties
    1. Sizi No. 4: Belongs to the category of early-maturing, large boll, medium fiber (i.e., lint). The plant shape is short and bushy, with roughly equal vertical and horizontal development. The top is flatter than Tuozhi cotton. The plant's structure appears compact, and the main stem and branches are very thick and strong. There is a lot of hair on the main stem, and the distance between each node on the main stem and branches is short. There are one to three leaf branches (i.e., water sprouts). The cotton boll is particularly round and large, with a short and sharp tip, and five-lobed bolls are more common. The leaves are large, hairy, and have a more aged color, and the leaf stalks are of medium length. The seeds are grayish-white, with dense short hairs on the surface. Each locule (i.e., compartment) of seed cotton has seven to nine seeds. The average weight of seed cotton per boll is six to seven grams. One hundred jin of seed cotton yields thirty-three to thirty-five jin of lint after ginning. The fiber length, as it currently stands, is about one inch, and can spin 32-count yarn. The yield of seed cotton per mu is approximately 180 jin.
    2. Sizi No. 2: Generally the same as Sizi No. 4. Comparatively speaking: the plant is taller, grows more vigorously, the structure is not compact, and it is more loosely spread. The internode distance is slightly longer. The main stem and branches are thinner and weaker. The boll is smaller and sharper. The leaves are larger and fatter, and the color is lighter. It matures slightly later. One hundred jin of seed cotton yields thirty-four to thirty-seven jin of lint after ginning. The fiber length is from one inch to one and one-sixteenth inches (one inch is divided into eight parts, which can be further divided into sixteen or thirty-second parts), and can spin 32-count to 42-count yarn. The yield per mu is equal to Sizi No. 4.
    3. Tuozhi Cotton: Belongs to the category of early-maturing, medium boll, short fiber. The vertical development is greater than the horizontal development, slightly taller and more pointed at the top than Sizi No. 4. The main stem and branches are very thick and strong, purple, and lighter in color than Sizi cotton. The internode distance is larger. There are one to four leaf branches. The cotton boll is medium in size, oval, angular, and four-lobed bolls are more common. There is less hair on the stems and leaves. The leaves are smaller than Sizi cotton and larger than Jinzi cotton, light green, and the leaf stalks are of medium length. The seeds are smaller than Sizi cotton, white or brown. Each locule of seed cotton has five to seven seeds. The average weight of seed cotton per boll is five to six grams. One hundred jin of seed cotton yields twenty-eight to thirty-three jin of lint after ginning. The fiber length is seven-eighths of an inch to one inch, and can spin 24-count to 32-count yarn. The yield of seed cotton per mu is approximately 140 jin.
    4. Jinzi Cotton: Belongs to the category of very early-maturing, small boll, short fiber. The plant has a tower shape and is relatively small and slender. The internode distance is shorter. There are one to three leaf branches. The cotton boll is round and small, and three-lobed bolls are more common. The leaves are smaller than medium-sized leaves, and the leaf lobes are deeper. The flowers are milky white, but have a red heart, which distinguishes them from other American cotton. The seeds are even smaller than Tuozhi cotton, brownish-gray. The average weight of seed cotton per boll is four to five grams. One hundred jin of seed cotton yields thirty-two to thirty-four jin of lint after ginning. The fiber length is three-quarters to seven-eighths of an inch, and can spin 20-count to 24-count yarn. The yield of seed cotton per mu is approximately 120 jin.
    (II) Degenerate Forms of Inferior American Cotton Plants
    1. Plant Degeneration: Such as the stem color turning green, the bolls on the plant appearing clustered (large leaves on the main stem, cotton bolls clustered on a single fruit branch). The plant is particularly thick and tall, or has a tall spindle shape with a protruding middle section, or is particularly short and bushy. The internode distance becomes longer. There is less hair on the branches, stems and leaves.
    2. Leaf Degeneration: Such as becoming wider and larger or becoming smaller. The leaves are pointed and narrow. The leaf color becomes white or light green, or green with beautiful spots.
    3. Branch Degeneration: Such as two or three large leaf branches standing upright. Two leaf branches growing opposite each other in the axils of the cotyledons. Leaf branches and fruit branches growing together on one node. An unusually large number of leaf branches. Small leaf branches clustered in the middle and upper parts of the cotton plant. Fruit branches becoming particularly long, short, thin, and upright.
    4. Flower Degeneration: Such as the absence of a red heart at the base of the petals but the appearance of a red heart, or the presence of purple spots, etc.
    5. Boll Degeneration: Such as bolls clustered in one place. The boll becoming smaller or longer. The boll shape differing from the original variety, or the boll shape varying on one plant, etc.
    6. Seed Degeneration: Such as white seeds turning green and small, or turning brown, bald seeds, or changes in shape, etc.
    (III) Observation Methods for Mixed and Inferior Plants in Cotton Fields
    Before flowering (at the latest before boll opening), in the early morning when the cotton leaves are slanted towards the sunlight, stand behind the cotton plant and observe the plant height, internode distance, compactness or looseness of the structure, the number of fruit branches and leaf branches, and the various shapes of the flowers, leaves, and cotton bolls. At this time, it is easiest to distinguish between good, bad, pure, and mixed plants, without having to bend over and examine closely. One person can take care of two or three rows. Or, in the rows of the cotton field, look ahead at a relatively distant place, and if you find that the plant height and cotton leaves have a unique shape, then approach to check other shapes. It is not necessary to bend over and examine closely one by one, otherwise it will often cause the eyes to become confused, especially since the differences between Sizi No. 2 and No. 4 are very subtle, making them even more difficult to identify.
    North China is vast, and the climate varies from place to place. Generally speaking, most warm areas are suitable for planting Sizi No. 2 and No. 4, and a few cold areas are suitable for planting Tuozhi cotton. As for Jinzi cotton, although it matures earlier, its yield and lint length are not as good as Tuozhi cotton, and it will soon be completely eliminated. The only key point is that only one variety of cotton should be grown in a cotton field. Maintaining a pure variety is the only way to maintain its inherent quality and yield forever unchanged. Therefore, to eliminate impurities, one must first understand the methods of identifying the variety.

　　四种美棉鉴别法
    舒联莹
    脱字棉又称脱里斯棉，金字棉又称金氏棉，斯字棉又称司通威耳棉，这三种棉花先后输入华北，尤其斯字棉包含两个同胞弟兄，一个是斯字四号，一个是斯字二号，均曾引起巨大的注意。脱字棉是民国八年以后，在华北奖励普及的品种。金字棉是美国原种，经日本人从朝鲜运来，民国六年日人在河北省的石家庄与御河区，及山东省的胶济沿线推广种植，民国八年山西省也曾购入推广。斯字棉四号是民国二十五年后从美国输入，以之代替脱字棉及金字棉，又经日伪期间的继续奖励，面积日广，后来颇呈居上之势。斯字棉二号是民国三十六年从美国输入推广，同它的同胞兄弟斯字四号差异甚微。这些品种输入的年代愈远，种子愈多混杂退化，我们要去杂去劣保持纯度，首先要晓得这四个美棉品种的鉴别方法。 　 （一）四种美棉的形态和性状
    一、斯字棉四号　属于成熟早、大棉铃、中等纤维（即绒）的一类。株形矮而繁茂，纵的发展与横的发展大体平均。顶比脱字棉平些。棉棵的组织显得紧密，干和枝甚粗壮。主干上长毛多，主干和枝每个节间的距离都短。叶枝（即水杈）一至三枚。棉铃特别圆而大，铃的尖端短而锐，五瓣铃较多。叶片大，有毛，颜色较苍老，叶子的柄中等长度。种子灰白色，上面短毛生得很密。每瓣（即室）籽棉有七粒到九粒种子。平均一铃籽棉重六至七瓦。每百斤籽棉轧花得皮棉三十三到三十五斤。纤维长度，照现在的状况约一英寸，可纺三十二支纱。每亩籽棉产量约一百八十斤。
    二、斯字棉二号　大致同斯字棉四号。比较的说：棉棵较高，生长较旺盛，组织不紧密，比较散张。节间距离稍长。干与枝较细弱。铃较小而尖。叶片较肥大，颜色较浅。成熟稍迟。每百斤籽棉轧花得皮棉三十四到三十七斤。纤维长度从一英寸到一又十六分之一英寸（一英寸分为八分再细分可分为十六分或三十二分），可纺三十二支至四十二支纱。每亩产量与斯字四号相等。
    三、脱字棉　属于成熟早、中等棉铃、短纤维的一类。纵的发展较横的发展大，比斯字四号略高而顶尖。干和枝甚粗壮，紫色，较斯字棉淡。节间距离较大。叶枝一至四枚。棉铃中等大小，卵圆形，有棱角，四瓣铃较多。茎叶上的毛较少。叶片较斯字棉小，较金字棉大，嫩绿色，叶子的柄中等长度。种子较斯字棉小，白色或棕色。每瓣籽棉有五粒到七粒种子。平均一铃籽棉重五至六瓦。每百斤籽棉轧花得皮棉二十八到三十三斤。纤维长度八分之七英寸到一英寸，可纺二十四支到三十二支纱。每亩籽棉产量约一百四十斤。
    四、金字棉　属于极早熟、小棉铃、短纤维的一类。棉棵塔形，比较瘦小。节间距离较短。叶枝一至三枚。棉铃圆而小，三瓣铃较多。叶片比中等的还小，叶上裂口较深。开花乳白色，但有红心，此点与其他美棉不同。种子较脱字棉还小，棕灰色。平均一铃籽棉重四至五瓦。每百斤籽棉轧花得皮棉三十二斤到三十四斤。纤维长度四分之三到八分之七英寸，可纺二十支到二十四支纱。每亩籽棉产量约一百二十斤。
    （二）美棉劣株的变态
    一、棉棵变态　如干色变青，棉棵上铃果呈丛集状（主干上叶大，棉铃丛生在果枝一处）。棉棵特别粗大而高，或呈高纺缍形中部凸出，或特别矮小而丛生。节间距离变长。枝干和叶上的毛变少。
    二、棉叶变态　如变阔变大或变小。叶片尖狭。叶色变白或淡绿，或绿色夹有美丽斑点。
    三、棉枝变态　如大叶枝二三个直耸。二叶枝对生于子叶的腋部。叶枝果枝骈生于一节之上。叶枝特多。小叶枝丛生于棉棵中上部。果枝特别变长、变短、变细而上耸。
    四、棉花变态　如花瓣底部无红心而发现红心，或有紫色斑纹等。
    五、棉铃变态　如铃丛生一处。铃变小变长。铃形与原品种不同，或一株上铃形不一等。
    六、棉籽变态　如白籽变绿而小，或变成棕色，光子，或形态改变等。
    （三）棉田中杂株劣株的观察方法
    在开花前（至迟吐絮以前），清晨棉叶斜向日光时，立于棉株之背后，观察棉棵高度、节间距离、组织紧或散、果枝叶枝的多寡、花叶和棉铃的各种形态。这时优劣纯杂最易辨认，不必俯首细察，一人可兼顾二三行。或于棉田行间，观看前方较远处，发现株式高低和棉叶有特异形态者，再临近检查其他形态。不必一一俯首细察，否则常使眼目昏乱，尤其斯字棉二号同四号差异本微，更不易识别。
    华北幅员广大，各地气候寒暖不一。一般的说，多数暖地宜种斯字二号及四号，少数寒地宜种脱字棉。至于金字棉虽然成熟更早，产量及绒长均不敌脱字棉，不久就会淘汰净了。惟一的要点，是一块棉田内只容有一种棉花生长，保持了纯种，才能保持固有的品质和产量永远不变，所以去杂去劣，首先要晓得品种的鉴别方法。
