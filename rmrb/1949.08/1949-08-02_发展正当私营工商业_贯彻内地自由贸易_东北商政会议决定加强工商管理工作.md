Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st – The Northeast Administrative Committee's Department of Commerce convened a joint conference of commerce and political affairs section chiefs from various provinces and cities in mid-July to preliminarily study how to develop private industry and commerce that benefits the people's livelihood and how to coordinate it with the state-owned economy. In his concluding remarks at the meeting, Lan Xianghui, Director of the Commerce and Political Affairs Section of the Department of Commerce, pointed out: The management of private industry and commerce (i.e., commercial administration work) is an indispensable part of the current economic construction. Under the general principles of developing production, prospering the economy, considering both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, promoting mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and facilitating domestic and foreign exchanges, commercial and political affairs work should implement free trade within the mainland and overcome all acts that violate government orders, such as arbitrarily prohibiting or restricting transportation, which hinder the circulation of goods. On the one hand, it is necessary to plan and step by step guide private capital to roads that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and conducive to the development of production, so that they can obtain appropriate development and normal profits; on the other hand, it is also necessary to effectively prevent and crack down on speculation and sabotage, in order to support the development of legitimate industry and commerce. The summary pointed out that the idea that all merchants are unscrupulous without distinction and the opinion that private merchants should be abolished are both wrong. For a considerable period in the future, that is, before state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce can undertake the task of supplying all public and private means of production and means of living and promoting products, private commerce still has its necessity for existence. Those who are beneficial to urban-rural exchanges and product distribution should be regarded as legitimate commerce; conversely, those whose business activities hinder urban-rural mutual assistance and production development must be corrected. According to the current situation, the scope of commercial and political affairs work is: (1) registering industry and commerce and approving business operations; (2) supervising the implementation of relevant regulations or interim measures on market management and cargo transportation and sales; (3) studying how to coordinate private capital with the state-owned economy, thereby planning to guide its development; (4) reporting and cracking down on illegal activities such as market speculation and sabotage; (5) reviewing and rewarding inventions and creations in private industry; (6) investigating and statistically analyzing the total circulation of commodities in the market; (7) appraising commodities and approving trademark registration; (8) organizing and leading industrial and commercial federations and trade associations. The meeting decided to focus commercial and political affairs work on ten major cities, conducting comprehensive surveys, registrations, and research on industry and commerce to help them develop rationally and reduce blindness. After gaining experience, it will be extended to small and medium-sized cities. In large cities, pilot exchanges for wholesale markets that play a decisive role in prices will be established to manage and control the market, but no price limit policy will be adopted at present. In market management, industry and commerce should be separated, and legitimate business operations should be separated from speculative activities, not only from a purely technical point of view, but also from a policy perspective. The meeting also believes that the agency stores designated by state-owned stores still have the necessity to exist at present and can be allowed to have a certain amount of capital, but their inventory must not exceed the total amount of their registered capital, in order to restrict their speculation and sabotage. Because the gold and silver industry has no prospect of development, it should be encouraged to switch to other industries. The concurrent operations and change of business of general shopkeepers should not be prohibited as long as they are not evading funds or engaging in speculative activities.

    发展正当私营工商业
    贯彻内地自由贸易
    东北商政会议决定加强工商管理工作
    【新华社沈阳一日电】东北行政委员会商业部七月中旬召开之各省市商政科长联席会议，初步研究了如何发展有利于国民生计的私人工商业及如何使其与国营经济相配合等问题。商业部商政处长蓝祥辉在会议总结中指出：私营工商业的管理工作（即商业行政工作），是目前经济建设中一个不可缺少的部分。商政工作在发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流的总方针下，应贯彻内地贸易自由，克服一切不遵守政府命令，随便禁运限购等有碍物资流通的行为。一方面要有计划、有步骤地把私人资本引向有利于国计民生、有利于生产发展的道路，使他们能够获得适当发展，获得正常利润；另方面也要有效地制止和取缔投机破坏，借以扶持正当工商业的发展。总结指出，不加区别地认为无商不奸的思想，和认为要取消私商的意见都是错误的。今后相当长的时期内，即在国营商业和合作社商业还不能负担起供给全部公私生产资料和生活资料及推销产品任务以前，私人商业仍有其存在的必要。凡对于城乡交流、产品分配有利者，应视为正当商业；反之，凡其业务活动妨碍城乡互助和生产发展者，则须注意纠正。根据目前情况，商政工作的范围为：（一）登记工商业，批准营业；（二）监督执行有关市场管理、货物运销等规章条例或暂行办法；（三）研究如何使私人资本与国营经济相配合，从而有计划地引导其发展；（四）检举、取缔市场投机捣把等非法行为；（五）审查和奖励私人工业的发明创造；（六）调查、统计市场商品总流通量；（七）鉴定商品及核准商标注册；（八）组织、领导工商会和同业公会。会议决定将商政工作重点放在十个主要城市中，进行工商业全面调查、登记、研究工作，以帮助其合理发展，减少盲目性。在取得经验后，再推广到中小城市。在大城市里，试办对物价起决定作用的批发市场的交易所，以便管理掌握市场，但目前不采取限价政策。在市场管理上工商要分开，正当商业经营与投机活动要分开，不仅是单纯从技术观点着眼去分，而且应根据政策去分。会议并认为：公营商店指定之代理店目前仍有存在的必要，可以允许其有一定数量的资金，但其存货不得超过其所登记资金之总额，借以限制其投机捣把。对金银业因其无发展前途，应鼓励转业。一般座商的兼业、转业，只要不是逃避资金或作投机活动，亦应不予禁止。
