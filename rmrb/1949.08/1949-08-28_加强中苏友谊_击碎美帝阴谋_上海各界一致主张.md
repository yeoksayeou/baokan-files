Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th. People from all walks of life in Shanghai continue to denounce the US White Paper. Commanders and fighters of the Shanghai Garrison Forces expressed their indignation, stating that they will resolutely and closely unite with the people of Shanghai to struggle to crush the new conspiracy of US imperialism. The political commissar of an artillery regiment stationed day and night along the coast said: We are coastal defense artillery units. If the enemy dares to invade our territorial waters, we will cooperate with the infantry to eliminate them right there, wherever they come from. Fu Hao, the CCP representative who participated in the military mediation executive group in 1946, said: "Now, we hold American-made 15mm howitzers, rocket launchers, carbines, airplanes, tanks, flamethrowers and other weapons in our hands. Each of us can tell the story of how these weapons came from New York, USA, to our hands. These are all testimonies of the White Paper.” Li Chang, the head of the Shanghai Youth League, said: "The publication of this White Paper has made us see more clearly the hypocritical face and cruel truth of US imperialism." Zhang Yumin, the head of the Shanghai Student Union, said: "This shameless act of US imperialism has universally aroused the hatred of people from all strata of Chinese society." Democratic personage Shi Liang called on everyone to "thoroughly smash the new conspiracy of US imperialism." Min Ganghou said: "Every patriotic Chinese should completely abandon illusions about US imperialism." Feng Tufu said: "To crush the new conspiracy of US imperialism, we must strengthen and consolidate the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union on the one hand, and on the other hand, we must persuade those who are still wavering, hesitating and waiting to abandon their illusions." Chen Shiying, a professor at Jiaotong University, said: "The White Paper's wishful thinking will inevitably be met with a full and powerful counterattack from the Chinese people, including the education and engineering circles."

    【新华社上海二十七日电】沪市各界人士继续斥责美国白皮书，驻沪警备部队指战员愤慨表示：将坚决地和上海人民紧密地团结在一起，为粉碎美帝国主义的新阴谋而斗争。日夜守卫在沿海一带的某部炮兵团政委说：我们是海防炮兵部队，如敌人胆敢向我领海侵扰，它从那里来，我们就配合步兵把它消灭在那里。曾于一九四六年参加过军事调处三人执行小组的中共代表符浩说：“现在我们手中拿着的美造十五生的榴弹炮、火箭炮、卡宾、飞机、坦克、火焰喷射器等等武器，我们每一个人都能说出这些武器何以从美国纽约到了我们手中的故事。这些都是白皮书的见证。”沪市青年团负责人李昌说：“这次白皮书的发表更使我们清楚地看到了美帝国主义的伪善面目和凶残真相。”沪市学联负责人张渝民说：“美帝国主义的这种无耻行动，已普遍引起中国各阶层人民的痛恨。”民主人士史良号召大家“彻底粉碎美帝国主义的新阴谋”。闵刚侯说：“每一个爱国的中国人应彻底丢掉对美帝国主义的幻想。”冯突符说：“要粉碎美帝国主义的新阴谋，我们必须一面加强和巩固中苏的友好关系，一面更须说服那些至今还在动摇、犹豫和观望的人们抛弃幻想。”交通大学教授陈石英说：“白皮书的妄想，必然会遭到中国人民包括教育及工程界在内的全体的全力的反击。”
