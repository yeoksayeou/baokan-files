People's Wealth Must Not Be Damaged!
Northwest Iron and Steel Company, Iron Smelting Department, Deputy Engineer
Neglect of Duty Damages Production
Fan Dehe Receives Demotion

[Taiyuan News] Fan Dehe, Deputy Engineer of the Iron Smelting Department of Northwest Iron and Steel Company, was demoted for being irresponsible in his work and damaging national wealth. On July 16, a serious malfunction occurred in No. 1 smelting furnace of the Iron Smelting Department. The furnace temperature was too low, and both slag and iron were in a semi-molten state of high-lime content condensate, causing great losses in production. It is estimated that more than one hundred tons of iron were lost, forty bottles of oxygen were consumed, and all employees rescued under the intense heat for more than forty hours to avoid danger. The reason for this was that Fan Dehe, the deputy engineer on duty, was irresponsible in his work. He slept for several hours during the night shift. When the fault occurred in No. 1 smelting furnace and the furnace condition deteriorated, Fan did not report to his superiors in time to find a way to save it. Instead, he asked for leave and left his job to shirk responsibility. When No. 1 smelting furnace was tapping iron, a "cannon" phenomenon occurred. Fan Dehe ignored the workers' suggestions to quickly find a way to deal with it, but left his post and returned to the dormitory. The Iron Smelting Department then convened a workers' criticism meeting to educate and criticize Fan. Fan Dehe has consistently been passive in his work since liberation, adopting a perfunctory attitude. The takeover comrades spoke to him several times, encouraging him to work actively in the future, but Fan Dehe's work attitude has not changed, resulting in this serious incident of damaging people's wealth. At this criticism meeting, Fan was able to accept the opinions of the masses, humbly examine himself, and asked the leadership to give him an opportunity to reform. The Iron and Steel Company then discussed and decided, with the approval of the Industrial Management Office, to demote Fan Dehe to clerk for education. Fan Dehe also expressed his sincere acceptance of this punishment. Chen Langhuan, manager of the Iron and Steel Company, and deputy managers Liang Haiqiao and Guo Qi Ying and other responsible cadres also made profound self-criticisms regarding the failure of the No. 1 smelting furnace in the Iron Smelting Department. They believed that the incident occurred because they did not conduct thorough inspections beforehand, and asked the leadership to criticize them.

　　人民财富不容损害！
    西北钢铁公司炼铁部副工程师
    玩忽职务损害生产
  　范德和受降级处分
    【太原讯】西北钢铁公司炼铁部副工程师范德和工作不负责任损害国家财富，受降级处分。七月十六日炼铁部第一号熔矿炉发生严重故障，炉温过低，渣铁俱呈半熔化状高石灰性之凝结物，使生产遭受莫大损失。计少出铁百余吨，消耗氧气四十瓶，全体职工于烈火下抢救达四十余小时之久，始免危险。究其原因，系该班值班副工程师范德和对工作不负责任，值夜班时曾先后睡觉数小时，及至第一号熔矿炉故障发生，炉况恶化，范亦未及时汇报上级设法挽救，反而借故请假离职推卸责任。当一号熔矿炉出铁时，发生“放炮”现象，范德和不顾工友建议，赶快设法处理，却离开工作岗位，回到宿舍。炼铁部随即召开职工检讨会，对范加以教育与批评。范德和在解放后一贯工作消极，抱敷衍态度，接管同志曾先后与其谈话数次，勉其今后积极工作，而范德和工作态度始终未见转变，致有此次严重损害人民财富事件的发生。此次在检讨会上，范尚能接受群众意见，虚心检讨，并要求上级给以改造机会。钢铁公司遂讨论决定，经工业管理处批准，将范德和降为工务员，以资教育。范德和对此处分亦表示诚恳接受。钢铁公司经理陈琅环、副经理梁海峤、郭奇应等负责干部，对炼铁部第一熔矿炉发生故障事件，亦作了深刻检讨，他们认为此次事件发生，因为他们事前检查不周，并要求上级予以批评。
