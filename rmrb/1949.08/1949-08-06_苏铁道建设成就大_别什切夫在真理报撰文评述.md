(Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 4th) Moscow dispatch: Soviet Minister of Railways, Beshchev, published an article in Pravda on August 1st, commenting on the great achievements of Soviet railway construction, stating:

    The Party, the government, and Stalin himself tirelessly care about the further development and technical equipment needs of the railways. Socialist industry is supplying the railways with more and more new and powerful locomotives, diesel locomotives and electric locomotives, freight cars and passenger cars, machines and rails. Railway construction funding is increasing daily. Many new lines are being laid. More than a thousand bridges, thousands of houses, and more than a hundred stations are also under construction. The largest railway junctions and stations are being renovated. Automatic signalers and other machines are being installed on major trunk lines, and the electrification of the most important routes is continuing. The government recently passed a resolution to further electrify the Moscow railway junctions.

    The welfare of railway workers is also constantly improving. The fund allocated this year for the culture and other services of railway workers is more than twice that of the pre-war year of 1940.

    The socialist competition of railway workers is expanding, providing new possibilities for the steady development of railways.

    Locomotive drivers are in the leading position in the competition. They have broken the old driving standards. The usual driving standard is 200 to 250 kilometers per day. But they have been able to drive more than 500 kilometers per day. This movement has quickly spread to the whole country in a relatively short period of time.

    The track is the foundation of the railway. The condition of the track is very important for the speed of the train and the application of carriages after the speed increases. Therefore, the creativity of the track workers on the Moscow Ring Railway is of great importance. Track foreman Chenko led a team of track workers to make the condition of the track under his responsibility very good. Other track workers also learned from his example. Moreover, their competition is based on organizational and technical measures and the mechanization of repair works. As a result, the entire Moscow Ring Railway now has the best tracks, ensuring smooth traffic.

    There are many other examples demonstrating the creativity of the Stakhanovite railway workers. Last year, railway workers exceeded their guarantees to reduce freight rates, save fuel, and increase labor productivity. In the first half of this year, freight rates stipulated in the plan have been reduced by 1.7 percent, and a large amount of fuel has been saved.

    Railway workers are making every effort to eliminate the scourge caused by the war, remove all special signal systems that reduce driving speeds, and improve the condition of each kilometer of track. A number of railway lines have now removed these expedient systems. The inspection of vehicles will be completed by the end of this year. The work done by railway workers in the first half of this year was 15.3 percent more than in the first half of last year.

    Railway construction in the Donets Basin, the Volga region, the Urals, and Siberia is developing the fastest. New equipment on the railways is increasing day by day. Science and production have become more closely integrated, and the greater creative activities of scientists and engineers will further provide the railways with more sophisticated equipment.

    Currently, railway workers are transporting grain. This is a huge task. The railways must transport grain, raw materials, and fuel to our cities and industrial centers in a timely manner in order to store the materials needed for the winter. The careful preparation of the entire railway economy for the winter has a decisive effect on the success of transportation work during the peak transportation season. In the winter of 1949 transitioning to 1950, railway workers decided to work in an organized manner, determined to ensure a new increase in freight volume.

    苏铁道建设成就大
    别什切夫在真理报撰文评述
    【新华社北平四日电】莫斯科讯：苏联铁道部长别什切夫于八月一日在真理报上撰文评述苏联铁道建设的伟大成就称：
    党、政府和斯大林本人，不倦地关心着铁路的进一步发展及技术装备的需要。社会主义工业供给铁路越来越多的新的强有力的机车、第塞尔机车和电气机车、货车和客车、机器和铁轨。铁路建设的经费日益增加。许多新的路线正在敷设着。有一千多座桥梁、几千所房屋和一百多座车站也正在建筑。最大的铁路连接点和火车站正在重修中。各主要干线正在装置自动信号器和其他的机器，最重要路线的电气化正在继续着。政府最近又通过决议，使莫斯科的铁路连接点进一步电气化。
    铁路职工的福利，也在不断增进。今年拨充铁路职工文化和其他服务的基金，相当于战前一九四○年的两倍多。
    铁路职工社会主义的竞赛正在扩展着，它提供了铁路稳步发展的新的可能性。
    机车司机在竞赛中居领导地位。他们打破了陈旧的行车标准。通常的行车标准是每天二百公里到二百五十公里。而他们已能每天行车五百公里以上，这个运动在相当短期间就已迅速扩展到全国。
    轨道是铁路的基础。转道的状况，对于行车的速度和速度增加后车厢的应用，十分重要。因此，莫斯科环行铁路道工的创造性，就有巨大的重要性。道工领班琴科领导一班道工，使他负责的那一段路轨的状况非常良好。其他的道工也就学习他的榜样。而且，他们的竞赛是以组织上与技术上的措施和修理工程的机械化为基础的。结果莫斯科环行铁路现在全线都有了最好的路轨，使交通畅通无阻。
    还有许多实例表现着斯塔哈诺夫式的铁路职工们的创造性。去年，铁路职工超过了他们减低运费、节省燃料和增加劳动生产率的保证。在今年上半年，计划所规定的运费已经减低了百分之一·七，并节省了大量燃料。
    铁路职工正全力消灭战争所造成的恶果，除去降低行车速率的一切特别信号系统，并改进每公里铁轨的状况。现在已经有好些铁路线除去了这些权宜之计的系统。车辆的检查将于今年底前完成。铁路工人今年上半年所作的工作，比去年上半年多百分之一五·三。
    顿尼兹盆地、伏尔加区、乌拉尔和西伯利亚的铁路建设发展得最快。铁路上的新式装备一天天地增加。科学与生产已经更加紧密地结合起来，科学家与工程师更大的创造性活动，将可能进一步供给铁路更多的完善装备。
    目前铁路职工正在运输谷物。这是件巨大的工作。铁路必须及时输送粮食、原料和燃料到我国的城市和工业中心去，以便贮存过冬所需要的物资。整个铁路经济为过冬所作的仔细的准备工作，对运输最多的季节中的运输工作之是否成功，有决定作用。在一九四九年过渡到一九五○年的冬季，铁路职工们决定在有组织的方式下工作，决心保证货运有新的增加。
