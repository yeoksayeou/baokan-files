　　Land Administration Bureau Invites Relevant Agencies to Discuss Land Price and Housing Price Issues

　　[This newspaper dispatch] The Beiping Municipal Land Administration Bureau held a symposium on housing and land prices at 9:00 AM on the 12th of this month. Representatives from the Finance Bureau, the Public Enemy Property Custody Bureau, the Construction Bureau, the Municipal Government Research Office, the Research Office of the North China People's Government Ministry of Finance, and the Tianjin Land Administration Office attended. The housing and land prices stipulated by the puppet Land Administration Bureau during the Kuomintang era were not in line with reality, and the division of land price areas and housing grades was unreasonable. In order to ensure that housing and land prices are in line with reality and achieve rationality, the Municipal Land Administration Bureau proposed the following issues for discussion at this meeting: Regarding the issue of housing and land prices being based on transaction prices, and proportionally referencing construction prices; the issue of adopting real unit calculation methods for housing and land prices; and issues such as the levels of housing and land prices, land grades, and housing categories. Once the discussions are mature, they will be submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and then implemented.
