　　School News Briefs
　　[This newspaper's report] To further enrich the equipment of the Tangshan Engineering Institute of Jiaotong University, the Ministry of Railways has allocated another 600 boxes of instruments previously held in Shanghai by the former puppet Jiaotong Ministry to the school. These instruments were newly purchased from the United States by the former puppet Jiaotong Ministry, intended for establishing a research institute in Nanjing, and have not yet been unpacked. Now, the school, upon the ministry's order, has sent representatives to Shanghai to receive them. It is estimated that these instruments will require twenty railroad cars for transport. (Qi)

　　[This newspaper's report] The Student Union of Beiping Normal University recently convened a meeting of over sixty responsible students from various social education units of the school to summarize the social education work during the summer vacation. Among the three hundred students who stayed at the school during this summer vacation, more than two hundred and twenty participated in social education work. In addition to continuing the existing workers' and police night schools, they also organized workers' political study classes, night schools for out-of-school children, literacy classes for women, summer tutoring classes, and other units, totaling eight. Over two thousand four hundred workers, rickshaw pullers, vendors, housewives, and out-of-school children participated in the studies. This not only educated the enrolled students but also had great educational significance for the students themselves, consolidating their belief in serving the people's education cause for life and initially establishing a working attitude and teaching method that connects with reality and the masses. The Student Union plans to continue running all social education units as much as possible in the next semester.
