Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: Tass, The Hague, 4th: Newspapers published a statement from the Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party regarding the development of the situation in Indonesia. The statement said: "It is now very clear that the war in Indonesia is ending with a serious defeat for Dutch imperialism. The Indonesian people's forces of resistance, led by the Democratic Front headed by the Communist Party, are constantly growing stronger. The Indonesian people will continue to fight bravely for their independence, regardless of the conspiracies of Dutch and American imperialism. Today, the people of Indonesia are facing a huge threat from the plans of American monopoly capitalists. These American monopoly capitalists are trying to turn Indonesia into their strategic base and source of cannon fodder, which they need to fight against the Asian national liberation movement and against the Soviet Union and democracy around the world. The North Atlantic Treaty and the Pacific Treaty currently being prepared are for these purposes of the United States. The United States wants to become the master of Southeast Asian countries, which damages the interests of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. With the help of certain Dutch groups and the Hatta-Sukarno group, American capital is seizing an important position in Indonesia." The statement emphasized that the reactionaries issued a ceasefire order in an attempt to force the Indonesian freedom fighters to abandon resistance and surrender to Dutch and American imperialism. Hatta and Sukarno played a leading role in this betrayal. The Hatta group's army is now jointly fighting the national liberation movement with the Dutch colonial army. The statement further pointed out that the Indonesian Communist Party understands all the conspiracies of the American and Dutch imperialists and their satellites, and calls on the Indonesian people to persist in the struggle for complete freedom. The Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party demanded that the Netherlands withdraw its troops in Indonesia and expressed its warm support for the Indonesian people fighting for freedom. The Central Committee also demanded that the Dutch government inform the Dutch people of all secret military agreements it had concluded with the United States and the Hatta group. The Central Committee demanded that freedom of activity be granted to the Indonesian Communist Party, trade unions, and youth organizations, which are now forced to operate underground.

    荷共中央发表声明
    揭露荷帝“停战”阴谋
    表示支援印尼人民斗争
    要求荷兰撤回侵略军队
    【新华社北平六日电】塔斯社海牙四日讯，报纸刊载荷兰共产党中央委员会关于印尼形势发展的声明。声明说：“现在已十分明显，在印尼进行的战争，以荷兰帝国主义的严重失败而终结。以共产党所领导的民主阵线为首的印尼人民反抗力量，正不断壮大。印尼人民将不顾荷美帝国主义的阴谋，继续勇敢地为他们的独立而战。今天，印尼的人民遭遇美国垄断资本家的计划的巨大威胁。美国垄断资本家力谋把印尼变成他们的战略基地和炮灰的来源，这些是他们为反对亚洲民族解放运动和对苏联及全世界的民主作战所需要的。北大西洋公约和正在准备中的太平洋公约，就是为了美国的这些目的。美国想成为东南亚各国的主人，这损害了荷兰与英国的利益。美国资本在某些荷兰集团及哈达——苏加诺集团帮助下，正在印尼攫取重要地位。”声明着重指出，反动派发布停战令，企图借此迫使印尼争自由的战士们放弃抵抗，向荷美帝国主义投降。哈达与苏加诺在这个出卖中扮演了领导的角色。哈达集团的军队与荷兰殖民军现在联合对民族解放运动作战。声明进一步指出：印尼共产党懂得美荷帝国主义者及其卫星的一切阴谋，号召印尼人民坚持争取完全自由的斗争。荷共中央要求荷兰撤回在印尼的军队，并表示热烈支援为自由而战的印尼人民。中央委员会也要求荷兰政府把他们与美国及哈达集团间所订的一切秘密军事协定告诉荷兰人民。中央委员会要求给予印尼共产党、职工会及青年团体以活动自由，这些组织现在被迫在地下活动。
