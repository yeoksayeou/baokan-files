[Reported by this newspaper] Zhang Xiaomei, director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Women's Federation, broadcasted yesterday (the 26th) on the People's Broadcasting Station, calling on "all women in Beiping to turn the resolutions of the All-Circles Representative Conference into action." She explained that this conference fully demonstrated the great improvement of women's status under the people's democratic regime. She pointed out that female members of the British Parliament account for only 4 percent, and female members of the US Congress account for only 2 percent, and those very few female representatives do not represent the interests of the broad proletariat and working women at all. However, "the female representatives attending this conference included female workers, female students, female teachers, female medical staff, government staff, representatives of democratic parties and women's organizations, a total of forty-two, accounting for about one-seventh of the 330 representatives. This is fundamentally different from capitalist and imperialist countries and the Kuomintang rule in the past. Our women representatives this time can represent the masses and have actively performed in the conference. When discussing Mayor Ye's government work report, ten women representatives spoke, accounting for one-third of the total number of speakers that day."

She pointed out: "This All-Circles Representative Conference is a good start for Beiping women to participate in the people's democratic regime and enjoy equal rights."

Comrade Zhang Xiaomei continued: "We women of Beiping congratulate the success of this People's Representative Conference, and we will take action to implement the various resolutions of this representative conference. So, how should we work hard to implement these resolutions?"

She mentioned: "First, we must vigorously assist the government in eliminating special agents." "We must not allow special agents to continue to sabotage. In the past, we women have not paid enough attention to this work. From now on, we should raise our vigilance and actively respond to this important work. If every woman in Beiping is observant and pays attention to whether there are special agents in factories, schools, organizations, and their own families, relatives, and neighbors, they should immediately report them and eliminate harm for the people. In this way, special agents will naturally have no place to hide. At the same time, we also ask the government to promptly and severely punish those chief special agents who are deeply hated by the people and have committed heinous crimes. We people will never pity or extend leniency to those big special agents who have harmed the people in the past and are still continuing to do evil."

"Second, we must enthusiastically respond to the government's call for production and economy." She said: "Beiping is a consumer city, especially women, many of whom lead parasitic lives of dependence and have no production skills. Now, we should overcome parasitic ideas, establish the view that labor is glorious, learn from the women in the old liberated areas, learn production skills, and participate in production labor as much as possible. Female workers who are already on the production front should work harder to improve their skills and study politics and culture. At the same time, we women in Beiping must economize everywhere. Female workers and working women should learn to save raw materials and improve quality, and other women should also save materials for the people in their daily lives. We must remember that the People's Liberation Army is still engaged in arduous and bloody battles for the liberation of the people of the whole country; many government staff are working very hard and incorruptibly to serve the people. We must always remember that a grain of rice, a strand of yarn, a drop of water, and a kilowatt of electricity are all the blood and sweat of the working people and the wealth of the country. We should pay attention to cherishing them and not waste them. Only by producing and saving together can we accumulate the wealth of the country, gradually improve the lives of all the people, and make our motherland prosperous and strong."

"Third, we must carry out women's social education work." She said: "We hope that all organizations, schools, groups, and people from all walks of life in Beiping will, to the extent possible, establish various women's night schools, literacy classes, and training courses to help the vast number of illiterate or less educated women, especially working women, to improve their cultural level. Intellectual women in Beiping, in particular, have an unshirkable responsibility and should actively participate in this work to help their culturally backward sisters."

"Fourth, we must assist the government in carrying out women's and children's welfare work. In the past, due to China's long-term reactionary rule, undeveloped science, lack of medical equipment and hygiene knowledge, countless working women died from difficult childbirth or diseases every year. Countless children also died as a result." This conference has passed a resolution requesting the government to carry out women's welfare and maternal and child health services. Here, we sincerely appeal to pediatricians, obstetricians and gynecologists, nurses, and various medical staff in Beiping, hoping that you will adhere to the noble will of serving the people, face the working masses, and serve the working people as much as possible. We also appeal to all social people who have childcare knowledge or are enthusiastic about women's and children's welfare, hoping that you will organize human and material resources as much as possible, raise funds to run women's and children's welfare undertakings, especially to run as many nurseries as possible, to serve the vast number of women and the next generation of New China.

Regarding other tasks resolved by the conference, such as reporting unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate, implementing land reform in the suburbs, dispersing the population, etc., she said: "We women should all have a share of our hearts and a share of our efforts." Finally, she told all the sisters in Beiping: "We are already one of the masters of New Beiping. We must bravely and confidently shoulder the responsibility of this master and turn the resolutions of the Beiping All-Circles Representative Conference into action."

　　全北平市妇女把各界代表会议的决议变为行动
    市妇联筹委会主任张晓梅广播词摘要
    【本报讯】北平市民主妇联筹委会主任张晓梅，昨（二十六）日在人民广播电台广播，号召“全北平市妇女把各界代表会议的决议变为行动”。她说明这次会议充分的证明了在人民民主的政权下，妇女地位的大大提高。她举出英国国会女议员只占百分之四，美国国会女议员只占百分之二，而那些极少数的女代表，也丝毫不代表广大无产阶级与劳动妇女的利益。可是，“这一次出席会议的女代表，包括了女工、女学生、女教员、女医护工作者、政府工作人员、民主党派和妇女团体的代表，一共四十二名，占全体代表三百三十名的七分之一左右，这与资本主义、帝国主义国家和过去国民党统治时期，是根本不同的，我们这次的妇女代表，都能代表群众，在大会上有积极的表现，当讨论叶市长的施政报告的时候，妇女代表有十个人发言，占那一天发言人总数的三分之一。”
    她指出：“这次各界代表会议，就是北平妇女参加人民民主政权，享受平等权利的很好的开始。”
    张晓梅同志接着说：“我们北平妇女，祝贺这一次人民代表会议的成功，而且，我们将用行动来实现这一次代表会议的各项决议。那末，我们应该怎样努力来实现这些决议呢？”
    她举出：“第一，我们要大力协助政府，肃清特务。”“我们绝不能让特务继续破坏活动，对于这种工作，我们妇女过去的确注意得还不够。今后，我们应该提高警惕，积极地响应这一重大的工作。如果北平每一个妇女都耳目灵敏，注意工厂、学校、机关和自己的家庭、亲友、邻居之间，有没有特务分子，有就立刻检举，为民除害。这样，特务分子自然就没有藏身之地了。同时，我们也要求政府对那些为人民所痛恨的罪大恶极的首要特务分子，要迅速地严厉地惩办。对于那些过去坑害人民，现在还继续作恶的大特务，我们人民是绝不怜悯，绝不施予宽大的。”
    “第二，我们要热烈响应政府生产节约的号召。”她说：“北平是一个消费城市，尤其妇女，很多过着寄生的依赖生活，一无生产技能。现在，我们应该克服寄生思想，树立劳动光荣的观点，向老解放区的妇女看齐，学习生产技能，尽可能的参加生产劳动。已经在生产战线上的女工，更要努力提高技术，学习政治与文化。同时，我们北平妇女，更要处处节约，女工和劳动妇女要学习节省原料，提高质量，其它妇女也要在日常生活上，为人民节省物资。我们要想到，解放军为了全国人民的解放，还在进行艰苦的流血战斗；许多政府工作人员，非常清苦而廉洁的坚持岗位，为人民服务。我们要时时想到一粒米，一缕纱，一滴水，一度电，都是劳动人民的血汗，都是国家的财富，应该注意爱惜，不能浪费。只有大伙一齐生产，一齐节约，才能积累国家的财富，才能逐渐改善全体人民的生活，使我们的祖国富强起来。”
    “第三，我们要开展妇女社会教育工作。”她说：“我们希望北平的各机关、学校、团体和各界人士，在可能范围内，尽量的成立各种妇女夜校、识字班、讲习班等，帮助广大的不识字或文化低的妇女，尤其是劳动妇女提高文化。北平的知识妇女们，尤其责无旁贷，应该积极参加这一工作，帮助自己文化落后的姊妹们。”
    “第四，我们要协助政府，开展妇女儿童福利工作。过去中国因为长期的反动统治，科学不发达，缺乏医药设备和卫生常识，广大的劳动妇女，每年死于难产或疾病的，不知多少。无数的儿童也都因此死”。这次大会已通过了请政府开展妇女福利和妇婴卫生事业的决议，我们在这里更诚恳的向北平的儿科、妇产科的医生护士和各种医护人员呼唤，希望你们秉着为人民服务的崇高意志，面向劳苦大众，尽可能更多的为劳动人民服务。我们也向一切有保育知识，或热心于妇女儿童福利事业的社会人士号召，希望你们尽量地把人力物力组织起来，集资举办妇女儿童福利事业，尤其是尽可能地多办托儿所，为广大妇女及新中国的下一代服务。
    对于大会决议的其他各项工作，例如检举囤积居奇、投机倒把的奸商，实行郊区土地改革，疏散人口等等，她说：“我们妇女都应该有一份心尽一份心，有一分力出一分力。”末了，她告诉全北平的姐妹们：“我们已经是新北平的主人翁之一了，我们必须勇敢地有信心地负起这个主人翁的责任来，把北平各界代表会议的决议变为行动。”
