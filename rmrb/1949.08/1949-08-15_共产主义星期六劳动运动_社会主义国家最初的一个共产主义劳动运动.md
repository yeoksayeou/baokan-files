    Communist Saturday Labor Movement: The First Communist Labor Movement in Socialist Countries
    In early February 1919, many military trains loaded with troops, ready to go to the front lines, were stopped at the Sorkilovochnaya station. These military trains could not move forward because there were no good locomotives. At that time, the White bandits and foreign interventionists were putting the young Soviet Republic, which had not yet been consolidated, in a difficult position. The main danger was on the Eastern Front. Kolchak was mobilizing a large army to press on Moscow, attempting to strangle the revolution. The Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party issued a call to the people: to start working in a revolutionary manner.
    A special Party meeting was held at the Sorkilovochnaya station to discuss the current situation and railway transport work under the circumstances of Kolchak's bandit army approaching the Volga River. After listening to the report of the station's political commissar, the Communist Party members attending the meeting decided to stay and repair the locomotives after their work was completed. They decided not to go home until the military trains resisting Kolchak's bandit army had departed. Fifteen half-starved people (at that time, each person was given a quarter of a pound of bread per day) finished their heavy work at the unheated station during the day and then continued working all night until the next morning.
    According to one of the participants at the time, the work situation was described as follows: "No one complained of fatigue. We worked with great enthusiasm, encouraging each other: 'The faster, the better.' Labor has never been so vigorous and joyful."
    The next morning, three repaired locomotives whistled and drove out of the station, dragging military trains to the front. At this time, the workers threw off their hats and sang the Internationale.
    The Communist Party members of Sorkilovochnaya station thus gloriously responded to the call of the Party Central Committee – to work in a revolutionary manner.
    On May 7, 1919, the conference of Communist Party members and sympathizers in the Moscow-Kazan Railway District unanimously adopted a resolution: Communist Party members and sympathizers should increase their working day by one hour and complete the work of these additional hours on Saturdays. The minutes of the meeting stated: "In view of the fact that Communist Party members should not be stingy with their health and lives in order to win the victory of the revolution, the work is unpaid. The 'Communist Saturday' labor movement should be promoted throughout the district until Kolchak's bandit army is completely defeated."
    On May 10, 1919 (later, the Soviet Union stipulated that this day would be the annual commemoration day - the author's note), when the first Communist Saturday collective labor movement was held, more than two hundred people participated. They repaired four locomotives, sixteen carriages, and loaded and unloaded a total of 9,300 poods of cargo.
    The great revolutionary leader Lenin saw a new attitude towards labor in the Saturday collective labor movement. Lenin wrote: "The Communist Saturday collective labor movement has great historical significance because this movement shows us the conscious and voluntary initiative of the workers, which is manifested in the development of labor productivity, in the transition to a new labor discipline, and in the creation of socialist economic and living conditions."
    The patriotic initiative of the Communist Party members of Sorkilovochnaya station was quickly supported by the workers of the Moscow station. According to the decision of the Moscow Committee of the Bolshevik Party, any meetings held on Saturdays were canceled, and many leaders actively participated in the Saturday collective labor movement. Lenin himself participated in the Saturday collective labor movement on May 1, 1920.
    Lenin called this cause started by the Communist Party members of Sorkilovochnaya station a "great beginning." He saw the sprouts of communism in the Communist Saturday collective labor movement. He wrote: "Communism begins when ordinary workers show selfless concern for increasing labor productivity and cherishing every piece of bread, coal, iron, and other items, overcoming heavy labor, and this every piece of bread, coal, iron, and other items is not supplied to the worker himself, nor to his 'relatives,' but to 'strangers'; that is, the entire society, which initially united into a socialist country, and later united into a federation of Soviet republics of tens of millions."
    Lenin brilliantly foresaw that the initiative of a few Communist Party members at the Sorkilovochnaya station would become the starting point for the movement to strive for high labor productivity.
    Soon after, it was not a few Communist Party members, but millions of Soviet people who began to work with a new attitude. The spark of the first Communist Saturday collective labor movement ignited into a raging flame of socialist competition for the entire people. As Comrade Stalin pointed out, socialist competition became the communist method of engaging in socialist construction.
    Comrade Stalin summarized the first Five-Year Plan, saying: "Where is the basic force that guarantees us this historically significant victory? This is first and foremost the initiative, selflessness, enthusiasm, and creativity of millions of workers and collective farmers. They, together with the strength of technicians, exerted the great power of unfolding socialist competition and shock work. Without a doubt, without this situation, we would not be able to reach our goals, nor would we be able to move forward even one step."
    In the struggle to complete the various Stalin Five-Year Plans, during the Great Patriotic War, and in the implementation of the post-war Five-Year Plan, the socialist competition of the entire people and the selfless labor of the Soviet people have played and are playing the most important role in achieving the victory of worldwide historical significance in the Soviet Union.
    Take Sorkilovochnaya station as an example! It used to be a small station near Moscow, but now it has become a powerful railway hub. A team of excellent labor organizers has grown up from the ranks of ordinary workers. They have fully mastered business technology. About a thousand people have received government awards. All station personnel are now participating in the competition to increase labor productivity. A welder completed the five-year quota as early as 1946. Two other lathe operators completed the four-year quota in 1946, and one of them has been doing the work for 1958 since January this year. During the three years of implementing the post-war Five-Year Plan, about two thousand workers completed quotas ranging from four and a half to twelve years.
    This kind of labor is what Lenin called communist labor. There are many such people in the Soviet Union, and their number is increasing day by day. They are the vanguard of the soldiers fighting for the new Five-Year Plan and for the victory of communism.

    共产主义星期六劳动运动  社会主义国家最初的一个共产主义劳动运动
    一九一九年二月初，准备开赴前线的许多军用列车满载着军队，停留在索尔基洛沃契娜娅车站。这些军用列车无法前进，因为没有好的机车。当时，白匪和外国干涉者正在窘迫尚未巩固的年青苏维埃共和国。主要的危险在东线。高尔察克调动大军向莫斯科进逼中，企图绞杀革命。布尔塞维克党中央委员会向人民发出了号召：革命式地着手工作。
    索尔基洛沃契娜娅车站召开了党的特别会议，要讨论的问题是：在高尔察克匪军进逼伏尔加河情况下的目前形势及铁道运输工作。出席会议的共产党员听取了车站政委的报告后，决议在工作完毕后留下来修理机车。他们决定在抵抗高尔察克匪军的军用列车未出发前不回家。十五个半饥饿的人（当时每人每日发四分之一磅面包）白天在无暖气装置的车站做完了繁重的工作，后来又继续工作了一整夜，直到次日的早晨。
    据当时的一个参加者讲述当时的工作情况说：“没有一个人抱怨疲倦。我们兴致勃勃地工作，相互激励道：‘谁快，谁好。’劳动还从未是那样奋发愉快的。”
    次日早晨，三台修理好了的机车呜呜地叫着开出了车站，拖着军用列车上前线了。这时候，工人们摔掉了帽子，高唱起国际歌来了。
    索尔基洛沃契娜娅车站的共产党员便这样光荣地响应了党中央委员会的号召——革命式地工作。
    一九一九年五月七日，莫（斯科）喀（山）铁路区共产党员和同情分子大会一致通过一项决定：共产党员和同情分子应该增加工作日一小时，于星期六完成所增这些小时的工作。会议记录称：“鉴于共产党员为争取革命胜利，不应该吝惜自己的健康和生命，工作是无报酬的。‘共产主义星期六’劳动运动应在全区推行，直到完全战胜高尔察克匪军。”
    一九一九年五月十日（后苏联规定是日为每年的纪念日—笔者注），举行第一次共产主义星期六集体劳动运动时，参加者已在两百人以上。他们修复了四台机车，十六辆车皮，卸货及上货共重九千三百普特。
    伟大的革命领袖列宁，从星期六集体劳动运动中看出了新的劳动态度。列宁写道：“共产主义星期六集体劳动运动之所以具有巨大的历史意义，乃因为这一运动向我们表明了工人的自觉自愿的创始，这一创始表现在劳动生产率的发展上，在向新劳动纪律的过渡上，在社会主义经济条件和生活条件的创作上”。
    索尔基洛沃契娜娅车站共产党员的这一爱国主义的创始，很快就受到了莫斯科车站的工人的拥护。根据布尔塞维克党莫斯科委员会的决定，星期六举行的任何会议均告取消，许多领导人员都积极参加了星期六集体劳动运动。列宁并亲自参加了一九二○年五月一日的星期六集体劳动运动。
    列宁将索尔基洛沃契娜娅车站的共产党员所开始的这一事业称为“伟大的创始”。他从共产主义星期六集体劳动运动中看见了共产主义的萌芽。他写道：“共产主义便开始于普通工人对于提高劳动生产率和爱护每一块面包、煤、铁及其他物品表现忘我的、克服繁重劳动的关心，而这每一块面包、煤、铁及其他物品不是供给工作者本人的，也不是供给其“亲近者”的，而是供给“疏远者”的；也就是说，是整个社会，是起初联合为一个社会主义国家、后来则联合为苏维埃共和国联邦的成十成百的百万人。”
    列宁天才地预见了索尔基洛沃契娜娅车站少数共产党员的创始，将成为争取劳动生产率高涨运动的发端。
    不久以后，不是少数共产党员，而是成百万苏维埃人开始以新态度工作了。第一次共产主义星期六集体劳动运动的星星之火，燃成了全体人民社会主义竞赛的熊熊之焰。如斯大林同志所指出的，社会主义竞赛成为了从事社会主义建设的共产主义方法。
    斯大林同志总结第一个五年计划时说：“给我们保证这一有历史意义胜利的基本力量在那里呢？这首先是成百万工人和集体农民的积极性、忘我精神、热忱、创造性。他们和技术人员力量一道发挥了展开社会主义竞赛和突击工作的巨大力量。毫无疑问，没有这一情况，我们便达不到目标，一步也前进不了。”
    在为完成各次斯大林五年计划而斗争时，在伟大卫国战争期间，在实行战后五年计划时，全体人民的社会主义竞赛和苏维埃人的忘我劳动，在取得苏联的全世界历史意义胜利上，曾起了并正在起着最重要的作用。
    以索尔基洛沃契娜娅车站来说吧！它从前是靠近莫斯科的一个小车站，现在已成为强大的铁道重镇。一支优秀的劳动组织者部队从普通工人的行列中成长起来了。他们是完全掌握了业务技术的。获得政府奖赏人员共约一千人。全体车  站人员现在都参加了争取提高劳动生产率的竞赛。一个焊接匠早在一九四六年便完成了五年的标准。另两个旋盘工一九四六年时完成了四年的标准，其中一人自今年一月起，已在做一九五八年的工作。在实行战后五年计划的三年间，完成了四年半到十二年的标准的工人约两千人。
    这种劳动就是列宁所谓的共产主义劳动。这种人在苏联是很多的，其数目正在与日俱增。他们便是为新五年计划、为共产主义胜利而奋斗的战士的先锋队。
