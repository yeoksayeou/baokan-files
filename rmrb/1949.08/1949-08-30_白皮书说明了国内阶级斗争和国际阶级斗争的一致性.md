The White Paper Illustrates the Consistency of Domestic and International Class Struggle
    Wu Yuzhang
    The White Paper is a black ledger of American imperialism's aggression against China. In listing its crimes, it also illustrates a truth—the truth of class struggle: there can be no compromise, let alone friendship, between the people and the reactionaries; only resolute and tenacious struggle against the reactionaries, overthrowing them, can bring liberation. In the course of the struggle, the people of the world and the reactionaries of all countries will inevitably be divided into two distinct and hostile camps. Therefore, harboring any illusions about feudal remnants or imperialists is an unforgivable folly.
    The White Paper unceremoniously scolded the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, blaming them for being incompetent. However, despite the scolding, and despite their incompetence, support must still be given. And if it were not for the fear of the Chinese people's strength and the disagreement of the American people, it is said that they would have liked to carry out large-scale military intervention in China and even wanted to "co-manage" the Northeast. This shows that without the support of imperialism, the Chinese reactionaries would certainly not be able to maintain their rule, and imperialism must also rely on the reactionaries to carry out aggression unscrupulously. Eliminating the reactionaries also eliminates the pillar of imperialism because they are in the same camp. As for the American people, we must distinguish them from the imperialists. The actions of the imperialists do not represent the will of the American people, and at the same time, we cannot apply our views of the American people to the imperialists.
    Acheson clamored to oppose "any regime established in China that serves foreign interests" and to oppose "the fragmentation of China under foreign open or secret influence." There is one regime in China that serves foreign interests, and that is the Kuomintang reactionary regime that has been defeated by the people. It is none other than American imperialism that attempts to support the reactionary forces in various parts of China and fragment China. Although the White Paper does everything possible to slander and provoke the friendship between the Chinese people and the Soviet Union, the Chinese people understand very well that it is American imperialism, not the Soviet Union, that brought airplanes and cannons to China to slaughter the people. Even the likes of Marshall and Acheson have to admit that the victory of the Chinese people is the product of internal forces in China. We do not deny that we are on the side of the Soviet Union, because we belong to the people's camp, just as all imperialists and feudal remnants belong to the anti-people's camp.
    American imperialism's aid to Chiang has completely failed, so it pins its hopes on so-called "democratic individualists." No matter what, there are not many Chinese who are willing to be American fifth columnists. However, we must recognize the laws of historical development and look at problems from the perspective of class struggle. Today, there is absolutely no third way between the people's camp and the anti-people's camp. Otherwise, if you always think that you are impartial and the fairest in the world, and want to stand on a supra-class position, instead of standing on a revolutionary and correct class position to look at things, it will be difficult to understand things clearly, and therefore, it is easy to be fooled.

### 白皮书说明了国内阶级斗争和国际阶级斗争的一致性

　　白皮书说明了国内阶级斗争和国际阶级斗争的一致性
    吴玉章
    白皮书是美帝侵略中国的一篇黑帐。在它列举自己的罪行的时候，同时也说明了一个真理——阶级斗争的真理：人民和反动派中间不可能有任何妥协，更谈不到什么友谊，只有和反动派坚决顽强的斗争，把它们打倒才能获得解放。在斗争的过程中世界人民和各国反动派必然会分成两个鲜明敌对的阵营。所以对于封建残余或帝国主义者存任何幻想都是不可饶恕的愚蠢。
    白皮书不客气地把蒋介石反动集团骂了一顿，怪它们不争气。可是，骂尽管骂，不争气尽管不争气，支持还是要支持的。并且如果不是骇怕中国人民的强大力量和美国人民的不同意，据说还要想对中国大规模军事干涉，还想把东北“共管”。这说明了中国反动派没有帝国主义撑腰固然不能维持统治，而帝国主义也必须通过反动派才好放手侵略。消灭了反动派也就消灭了帝国主义的支柱。因为他们是一个阵营里面的。至于美国人民，我们是要把他们和帝国主义者区别开来。帝国主义者的行为不代表美国人民的意志，同时我们也不能把对美国人民的看法应用到帝国主义者身上去。
    艾奇逊叫嚣着要反对“中国建立起任何服役于外国利益的政权”，要反对“在外国公开或秘密影响下，使中国支离破碎”。在中国服役于外国利益的政权有一个，就是已被人民打垮了的国民党反动政权。企图支持中国各地反动势力而使中国支离破碎的不是别人，就是美帝国主义。白皮书虽然尽一切可能污蔑和挑拨中国人民和苏联的友谊，可是中国人民很明白，把飞机、大炮搬到中国来屠杀人民的正是美帝国主义，不是苏联。即使马歇尔、艾奇逊之流也不得不承认中国人民的胜利是中国内部势力的产物。我们并不否认我们是站在苏联一边的，其原因就在于我们是同属于人民阵营，正如各帝国主义者和封建残余势力是同属于反人民阵营一样。
    美帝援蒋是彻底破产了，于是寄幻想于所谓“民主个人主义者”。中国人不管怎样，甘心当美国第五纵队的到底不多。不过我们必须认清历史发展的规律，从阶级斗争观点去看问题，今天在人民与反人民阵营之间绝对没有第三条路。不然，老要觉得自己不偏不倚世界上顶公正，想站在超阶级的立场，而不站在一个革命的正确的阶级立场去看事情，就很不容易把事情搞清楚，因此也就容易上当。
