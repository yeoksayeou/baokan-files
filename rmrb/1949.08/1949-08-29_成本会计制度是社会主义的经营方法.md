Cost Accounting System is a Socialist Management Method
By K. Fedayev, translated by Shen Jiang

The resolution of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party regarding the re-implementation of price reductions from March 1, 1949, vividly demonstrates the Lenin-Stalin Party's concern for continuously improving the living standards of workers. This price reduction is possible due to the strong prosperity of the socialist economy and the victorious completion of the post-war Five-Year Plan implemented by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party.

The great tasks of the Five-Year Plan require mobilizing enormous resources, strengthening socialist capital accumulation, increasing the surpluses of various enterprises and economic sectors, and implementing a strict system of economy. To accomplish these tasks, it is necessary to vigorously consolidate the cost accounting system (also translated as economic accounting system – editor), reduce the production cost level of each enterprise, and strive to provide the country with more and better products with the existing amount of materials and money, based on strict economy in expenditures.

The socialist competition for super-plan capital accumulation, which began last year and is now developing victoriously, and the struggle to accelerate the turnover of working capital, which is increasingly unfolding due to the initiative of advanced enterprises in Moscow, vividly demonstrate that the millions of Soviet people led by the Bolshevik Party are actively fighting to save financial resources. Without this, there can be no genuine cost accounting system.

  The cost accounting system in socialist society is a method of planned management of socialist enterprises and a socialist management method. It can promote the completion of national plans with the least expenditure of materials and money.

The cost accounting system is based on the socialist state's conscious utilization of the law of value. The differences between the labor of workers in state-owned enterprises and the labor of collective farm peasants, between skilled labor and unskilled labor, and between intellectual labor and manual labor, which exist under socialism, make it impossible to directly calculate the expenditure of social labor using units of working time and necessitate value calculation. Value calculation is realized in the form of currency.

Comrade Voznesensky said: "In the socialist economy, the law of value means that monetary calculation must be implemented, not just physical calculation and planned production costs—the expenditure of social labor used to produce social products. This is very important because socialism requires the strictest calculation and planning of production."

The basis of the cost accounting system lies in the planned correspondence between the expenditure of social labor and its results. In practice, this means that the state requires enterprises implementing the cost accounting system to have income equivalent to their expenditures to offset them.

The expenditures of enterprises implementing the cost accounting system are primarily the costs of producing products, the amount of which is determined by the plan. As for income, it is the proceeds from selling products at nationally set prices. Therefore, enterprises that successfully complete their planned tasks and adhere to the expense standards predetermined by the plan can fully offset income and expenditure.

The prices of products produced by various enterprises are determined by the state. The state sets prices based on the cost of the products and the planned profit of each enterprise. In the consumer goods sector, business tax levied by the state is also considered. At the same time, the total amount of business tax is determined by the government according to the type of commodity and is fixed on the commodity price, and the total amount is rigidly stipulated. The level of cost and profit is directly determined by the work of the enterprise. At a certain price level, the lower the cost of the product, the higher the profit of the enterprise; conversely, increasing the cost will inevitably reduce profit.

The degree to which the enterprise's production expenses are compensated by the commodity prices, the amount of which is stipulated by the plan, determines the financial results (surplus or deficit) of the enterprise's work and is directly determined by the extent to which the enterprise completes its planned tasks in terms of both quantity and quality indicators. The cost accounting system aims to minimize the cost of products and increase the capital accumulation of enterprises.

However, reducing costs not only means an increase in the capital accumulation of enterprises but also an improvement in the financial situation. Systematically reducing product costs enables the state to reduce retail prices, thereby promoting the increase of workers' real wages, increasing the purchasing power of the ruble, and improving the ruble's exchange rate against foreign currencies.

Comrade Stalin taught: "Only an industry that systematically reduces commodity prices, only an industry based on the systematic reduction of product costs, and therefore, only an industry that systematically improves production, technology, and the organization of labor, as well as the methods and forms of managing the economy—only such an industry is the industry we need, because only such an industry can move forward, and only such an industry can enable the proletariat to achieve complete victory." (See Stalin's Collected Works, Vol. 9, p. 194)

The reason why the Party and the government were able to re-implement price reductions from March 1, 1949, is that socialist industry achieved a significant increase in labor productivity, an increase in the production of daily necessities, and a reduction in product costs in 1948. The huge profits obtained by the people due to the reduction of nationally set retail prices are a deficit in the state budget. This deficit should be compensated, and without a doubt, it will be compensated by a further increase in labor productivity and a further reduction in the cost of industrial products. The most important way to solve these tasks is to further strive to save state funds and further consolidate the cost accounting system in various enterprises.

The cost accounting system guarantees the individual calculation of the work of each enterprise and shows its actual situation. It influences the entire work process of the enterprise by using the method of ruble supervision over the implementation of the enterprise's production plan and financial plan and stimulates the development of the latest technology and its rational utilization.

　　　　×  　　　×  　　　　×

The first necessary condition for an enterprise to implement the cost accounting system is that the enterprise has actual independence within the limits of the plan stipulated by the state. This independence of the enterprise is manifested in granting the enterprise the rights of a legal person and the right to dispose of the funds allocated to it by the state. The amount of fixed capital and working capital allocated to it by the state is determined by the production plan and financial plan.

Allocating the necessary funds to the enterprise implementing the cost accounting system is the material basis for implementing the cost accounting system. The enterprise has its own independent balance sheet, which reflects the funds allocated to it by the state. In order to keep and use money, the enterprise must open an account in the Soviet State Bank and use this account to conduct its business. Enterprises implementing the cost accounting system also have the right to obtain special credit loans from the bank under emergency conditions and on a responsible repayment basis.

All these conditions for determining the independence of the enterprise in cost accounting ensure the combination of strict centralization in planning and the broadest creativity of the enterprise in implementing the plan. When the enterprise fully utilizes the rights of the cost accounting system it has acquired, it is possible to seek the most effective methods to complete the tasks of the plan stipulated by the state. But at the same time, the enterprise should strictly abide by the planned discipline stipulated by the state.

The independence of enterprise cost accounting requires that the enterprise bears material responsibility for its operating results, for preserving the funds given to it by the state, and for supplementing the funds from profits. Lenin wrote: "The reason why trusts and enterprises are based on the cost accounting system is precisely so that they can be responsible and fully responsible for ensuring that their enterprises do not lose money." (See Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 29, p. 420)

The material responsibility of enterprises implementing the cost accounting system is also manifested in the sanctions (fines, penalties, liquidated damages, compensation for losses) for violating the mutual obligations stipulated in the economic contracts between enterprises. Therefore, imposing sanctions for non-performance of contracts is a method for the buying and selling parties to supervise each other in rubles.

The state realizes the supervision of enterprises implementing the cost accounting system in rubles through funding and credit systems. Financial institutions and banks provide funding and credit to enterprises according to the extent to which the enterprise completes its production plan and financial plan. These financial institutions use the means of influencing enterprises implementing the cost accounting system by providing funding and credit to improve the work of the enterprise, and they impose sanctions on funding and credit for enterprises that have not completed the plan and have violated the principles of the cost accounting system in their work.

In addition to material responsibility, the cost accounting system also stipulates the material interests of enterprises in completing and exceeding the national plan. Enterprises that work well have the right to establish a reserve fund, a certain portion of which is used as the enterprise's planned profit and super-plan profit. However, this reserve fund is only established under certain conditions, which are: the enterprise must complete the planned production of commercial products in the overall performance and, of course, in the specified classification, and the enterprise must complete the tasks in the plan to reduce product costs and the profit plan. As long as one of these two conditions is violated, the enterprise will lose the right to establish a reserve fund.

The reserve fund is an important stimulus for enterprises implementing the cost accounting system in the struggle to complete the plan and exceed the plan. The funds in the reserve fund are used for: expanding production, improving the cultural living conditions of the enterprise's workers, and providing them with individual bonuses and temporary assistance.

The bonuses that winning enterprises in the All-Soviet socialist competition deserve are of great significance for providing material encouragement to enterprises that work well.

The material interests of enterprises implementing the cost accounting system in the summary of their work reflect the combination of the personal interests of workers and the interests of the entire country, which are unique to the socialist system. In this way, the cost accounting system creates the conditions for consolidating and developing the socialist principle: from each according to his ability, to each according to his work.

Advanced enterprises in our industry strictly abide by the principles of the cost accounting system and have achieved significant results in the struggle to save and accelerate the turnover of working capital. The entire staff of the Kolomna Machine Building Plant, which achieved 52 million rubles of super-plan capital accumulation in 1948, and the entire staff of the Sormovo Machine Building Plant, undertook an obligation in a letter to Comrade Stalin: to produce 17 locomotives and three steamboats over the plan in 1949 by saving raw materials, materials, and fuel. The Lianozovo Car Manufacturing Plant undertook an obligation to produce an additional train of all-metal passenger cars this year by saving materials. The entire staff of the Glukhov Integrated Enterprise undertook such an obligation: to save 2.5 million rubles in 1949 by accelerating the turnover of working capital.

These facts demonstrate the enormous internal production reserves that our enterprises have. The cost accounting system is the most important method for mobilizing these reserves.

The national movement to strive for surplus in enterprise work, to reduce costs and accelerate the turnover of working capital, and to improve the quality of products requires even more vigorously promoting the cost accounting system in all aspects of the enterprise—in the workshop, in the production group, in the work team.

The internal cost accounting system of the factory, relying on socialist competition and the Stakhanov work method, opens up vast possibilities for maximizing the utilization of the internal production reserves in our industry. It promotes the development of the strictest economy system in various production departments and stipulates the material interests of enterprise leaders and every worker in completing the plan and exceeding the plan in the departments where they work. The internal cost accounting system of the factory is of great significance in reducing product costs. Comrade Malenkov said in his report at the 18th National Congress of the Party, "The cost of products is the basic indicator that shows the quality of the entire work of the enterprise."

The cost accounting system for workshops, production groups, shifts, and work teams is also based on the correspondence between production expenses and work results, but it differs in form from the cost accounting system for the entire enterprise. The plan for any link of the cost accounting system within the enterprise should only include the indicators for which that link can be responsible.

The experience of advanced enterprises shows that it is necessary to establish a simple cost accounting system for workshops and production groups, especially for work teams. Workshops are organizational parts of the enterprise, so it is impossible to have an independent balance sheet, bank account, and contractual relationship with other workshops.

A monthly production plan should be established for the workshop implementing the cost accounting system, a rigid wage limit stipulated according to the number of workers and funds, a limit on the necessary materials supplied by the factory warehouse, and a workshop expense budget. Based on these indicators, the cost accounting cost of the workshop's products can be determined. The workshop is responsible for the cost level; the workers in the workshop have a material interest in reducing costs. The system for rewarding workshop workers for their work performance should also be rigidly stipulated.

The transition of workshops and production groups to the implementation of the cost accounting system should be supported by a series of organizational and technical and educational measures to stimulate the creativity of all workers in the workshop.

The entire practice of advanced enterprises shows that the internal cost accounting system of the factory brings remarkable results. For example, the Stalin Automobile Factory in Moscow has implemented the cost accounting system in many workshops. In 1948, the factory achieved 47.4 million rubles of super-plan capital accumulation due to the reduction of product costs. The factory has reached the point where most workshops implementing the cost accounting system can work with a surplus.

Almost all workshops of the Red Mountain Machinery Factory have implemented the cost accounting system. The factory undertook such an obligation: to accelerate the turnover of working capital by 37 days and to hand over 10 million rubles to the national treasury.

Recently, in many advanced enterprises, not only workshops and production groups, but also factory management departments such as the main technology section, the main mechanical section, and the supply section have implemented the cost accounting system. This is something new in socialist management. These management departments, like the workshops, are tasked with reducing the cost factors related to them. The transition of the enterprise's supply department to the implementation of the cost accounting system is of great significance. Everyone knows that the lack of a proper system for material supply in enterprises often causes huge losses, and the turnover rate of working capital is delayed due to the establishment of excessive material storage.

Our Party has always attached great importance to the development and consolidation of the cost accounting system. In the national struggle to complete the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, Party organizations should strictly follow Comrade Stalin's famous instructions as a guide, which is: "Develop and consolidate the cost accounting system, increase the internal capital accumulation of industry, that is the task." The Bolshevik Party is unremittingly implementing Stalin's instruction, guiding the Soviet people towards a new prosperity of the Soviet economy and culture.

　　成本会计制度是社会主义的经营方法
    Ｋ·费达歇夫作  沈江译
    苏联部长会议与联共中央关于自一九四九年三月一日起再度实行减低物价的决议，鲜明地表现了列宁、斯大林党对于不断提高劳动者生活水平的关心。这次减价之所以可能，是由于社会主义经济的强大的繁荣，及苏维埃人民在布尔塞维克党领导下所实行的战后五年计划的胜利完成。
    五年计划的伟大的任务，要求动员庞大的资源，加强社会主义资金积累及提高各企业与各经济部门的盈余，实行严格的节约制度。为了完成这些任务，必须极力巩固成本会计制度（亦译经济核算制——编者），缩减每一企业的生产费用水平，力求在物资与金钱的现有数额下，在严格节约其开支的基础上给国家提供更多更好的生产品。
    从去年开始而现在正在胜利发展的超计划资金积累的社会主义竞赛，及由于莫斯科的先进企业的倡导而日益展开的加速流动资本周转的斗争，鲜明地证明了布尔塞维克党所领导的成百万苏维埃人民，正在积极地为节约资财支出而斗争。没有这一点，便不可能有真正的成本会计制度。
    　　 ×            ×             ×
  　社会主义社会中的成本会计制度，乃是有计划地管理社会主义企业的方法，是社会主义的经营方法。它可以促进用物资与金钱的最少支出来完成国家计划。
    成本会计制度是以社会主义国家对于价值法则的有意识地利用为基础的。社会主义下所存在的国营企业工人劳动与集体农庄农民劳动之间的差别，熟练劳动与不熟练劳动之间的差别，智力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别，使直接用工作时间的单位来计算社会劳动的支出成为不可能，并引起价值计算的必要。价值计算是以货币的形式实现的。
    沃兹涅辛斯基同志说：“在社会主义经济中，价值法则表示必须实行货币计算，而不仅是实物计算和计划生产费用——用于生产社会生产品的社会劳动的支出。这是非常紧要的，因为社会主义要求对生产要有最严格的计算与计划。”
    成本会计制度的基础，在于社会劳动支出与其结果有计划的相适应。实际上，这表示国家要求实行成本会计制的企业的支出须要有与之相当的收入来抵偿。
    实行成本会计制的企业的支出，首先乃是生产生产品的费用，这种费用的多少，是用计划来确定的。至于收入，则是按照国订价格出卖生产品所得。因此，胜利地完成其所承担的计划，并遵守计划所预定的费用标准的企业，是完全有可能使收支相抵的。
    各企业所生产的生产品的价格，是由国家规定的。而国家规定价格，则是从生产品的成本与各该企业的计划利润出发。在生产消费品的部门，并要从国家所征收的营业税出发。同时，营业税的总额是由政府按商品种类确定的，且固定于商品价格上，总额的多少是硬性规定了的。至于成本与利润之高低，是由企业的工作所直接决定的。在一定的物价水平下，生产品的成本愈低，则企业的利润愈高；反之，提高成本便必然使利润减低。
    仅是以数额是用计划规定了的商品价格，来补偿企业的生产费用所达到的程度，便决定了企业工作的财政结果（盈余或亏蚀），并直接决定于企业在数量指数和质量指数两方面完成所承担的计划的程度。成本会计制度便是以极力减低生产品的成本和增大企业的资金积累为目标的。
    但减低成本不仅表示企业的资金积累增大，同时也表示了财政情况的改进。有步骤地减低产品成本，便可以使国家有可能减低商品的零售价格，从而促进劳动者实际工资的增加，提高卢布的购买能力，改进卢布对外币的汇率。
    斯大林同志教导说：“只有有步骤地减低商品价格的工业，只有以有步骤地减低产品成本为基础的工业，因而，只有有步骤地改进生产、技术与劳动组织以及管理经济的方法与形式的工业，——只有这种工业，才是我们所需要的工业，因为只有这种工业才能向前发展，只有这种工业才能使无产阶级获得完全的胜利。”（见斯大林全集第九卷第一九四页）
    党与政府之所以有可能自一九四九年三月一日起实行再度减低物价，是由于社会主义工业在一九四八年中达到了劳动生产率的大大增高，和日用必需品生产的提高及产品成本的减低。由于国订零售价格减低而使人民获得的巨大盈利，乃是国家预算的亏损。这一亏损应该予以抵偿，而且毫无疑问，将以劳动生产率的再度增高及工业产品成本的再度减低来抵偿。解决这些任务的最重要的方法，便是进一步地力求节约国家资财，进一步地巩固各企业中的成本会计制度。
    成本会计制度保证着每一企业的工作的个别计算，并显示其实况。它以卢布监督企业的生产计划与财政计划的实行这一方法，影响着企业的全部工作过程，并刺激着最新颖的技术的发扬及其合理利用。
    　　　　×  　　　×  　　　　×
    企业实行成本会计制度的第一个必要条件，乃是该企业在国家所规定的计划限度内有实际的独立性。企业的这一独立性表现于给予企业以法人的权利及支配国家所分配予它的资财的权利。国家分配予它多少固定资本和流动资本，是看生产计划和财政计划来确定的。
    分配予实行成本会计制的企业以其所必要的资财，乃是实行成本会计制的物质基础。企业有其独立的资产负债表，其中反映了国家所分配予它的资财。企业为了保管与支用金钱，得在苏联国家银行中立下一个帐项户头，使用这一帐项以进行其业务。实行成本会计制的企业并且有权在紧急情况和负责归还的条件下，获得银行的特殊信用贷款。
    确定企业在成本会计上的独立性的这一切条件，保证着使订计划的严格集中与企业在实行计划上最广泛的创造性结合起来。企业于完全利用它所获有的成本会计制的权利时，便有可能寻求效果最大的方法来完成国家所规定的计划的任务。但同时，企业也应该严格地遵守国家所规定的计划的纪律。
    企业成本会计的独立性，需要该企业对其经营结果、对保存国家所给予它的资财及从利润中补充资财，担负物质责任。列宁写道：“托辣斯和企业之以成本会计制度为基础，正是为了使它们可以负责、并且可以完全负责使自己的企业不致亏损。”（见列宁全集第二十九卷第四二○页）
    实行成本会计制的企业的物质责任，也表现于对规定在企业相互间的经济合同中的相互义务违犯时的制裁上（罚金，惩处，违约罚金，损失补偿）。因此，对不履行合同而加以制裁，乃是买卖双方以卢布进行相互监督的方法。
    国家通过资助、信贷制度，实现用卢布来监督实行成本会计制的企业。财政机关与银行，按照企业完成其所承担的生产计划与财政计划的程度，而对企业给予资助和信贷。这些财政机关用对实行成本会计制的企业给予资助与信贷这一影响的手段，而达到该企业的工作的改善，对于没有完成计划和在工作中违犯成本会计制原则的企业，则在资助及信贷上给予制裁。
    除了物质责任以外，成本会计制度还规定了企业在完成和超过国家计划时的物质利害关系。工作得好的企业有权利成立公积金，其中有一定的一部分是作为该企业的计划中的利润和超计划的利润的。但是，这一公积金只是在一定的条件下才成立的，条件便是：企业在总合表现上和当然也在规定的分类上，都要完成所承担的出产商业生产品的计划，企业要完成减低产品成本计划中的任务及利润计划。只要违犯这两个条件中的一个条件，便会使企业丧失成立公积金的权利。
    公积金乃是实行成本会计制的企业在争取完成计划并超过计划的斗争中的重要刺激。公积金的资财用于：扩大生产，改进该企业工作者的文化生活条件，给予他们以个人奖金及临时援助。
    在全苏联社会主义竞赛中获胜的企业所应得的奖金，对于工作得好的企业给予了物质鼓励的重大意义。
    实行成本会计制的企业，在其工作总结上的物质利害关系，反映着社会主义制度所特有的工作者，个人利益与整个国家利益的结合。这样，成本会计制度便创立了巩固与发展社会主义原则的条件。社会主义的原则便是：各尽所能，按劳取酬。
    我们工业中的先进企业严格地遵守成本会计制度的原则，在节约及加速流动资本周转的斗争上获得了重大的成绩。一九四八年获得了五千二百万卢布超计划资金积累的科洛明机器制造厂的全体人员，与索尔莫夫机器制造厂的全体人员，在致斯大林同志的函件中承当了一项义务：于一九四九年中赖节约原料、物资及燃料而超计划地出产十七台机车与三艘汽艇。利阿诺佐夫车皮制造厂承担了一项义务：于今年赖节约物资而多出产一列全部金属制的客车。格鲁霍夫综合企业的全体人员则承担了这样的义务：赖加速流动资本周转而在一九四九年节省二百五十万卢布。
    这些事实证明了我们的企业具有怎样巨大的生产内部储备力量。成本会计制度乃是动员这些储备力量的最重要的方法。
    　　×  　　　　×  　　　　×
    争取企业工作有盈余、争取成本减低和流动资本周转加速，以及争取生产品质量提高的全民运动，格外有力地要求着在企业的各环节发扬成本会计制度——在车间，在生产组，在工作队。
    工厂内部的成本会计制，依靠着社会主义竞赛和斯达哈诺夫工作方法，对于尽量利用我们工业中所具有的生产内部储备力量开辟了广大的可能性。它促进了最严格的节约制度在各生产部门的发扬，并规定了企业领导人及每一个工作者在所工作的部门完成计划和超过计划的物质利害关系。工厂内部的成本会计制在减低产品成本上具有很大的意义。马林可夫同志在党第十八次代表会议上的报告中说，“生产品的成本乃是表明企业的全部工作质量的基本指标。”
    车间的、生产组的班次的与工作队的成本会计制，也是以生产费用与工作结果的相称为基础的，但在形式上与整个企业的成本会计制有区别。在企业内部任何一个实行成本会计制的环节的计划中，都应该仅仅包括该环节所可以负责的指数。
    先进企业的经验表明，必须为车间及生产组，尤其是为工作队建立简易成本会计制。车间为企业的组织部分，因此，不可能有独立的资产负债表、银行帐项以及与其他车间的合同关系。
    应该为实行成本会计制的车间，订立每月生产计划，按工作人数及基金而规定的硬性工资限度，由工厂仓库供应必要物资的限度，及车间开支预算。根据这些指数，便可以确定车间生产品的成本会计制的成本。车间是对成本的水平负责的；车间的工作者对于减低成本是有物质利害关系的。奖励车间工作者工作成绩的制度，也应该硬性地予以规定。
    对于车间与生产组转至实行成本会计制度，应该以一系列组织技术上与教育上的办法来予以支持，以刺激车间全体工作者的创造性。
    先进企业的全部实践表明了工厂内部的成本会计制带来着显赫的成果。例如莫斯科的斯大林汽车工厂已使许多车间实行了成本会计制度。该厂一九四八年因减低产品成本而获得了四千七百四十万卢布的超计划资金积累。该厂已达到大多数实行成本会计制的车间工作能有盈余的程度。
    红山机械工厂的各车间几乎全已实行成本会计制。该厂承担了这样的义务：使流动资本周转加快三十七天，并向国库解交一千万卢布。
    最近在许多先进企业中，不仅车间和生产组，而且也有象主要技术科、主要机械科、供给科之类的工厂管理部门，都实行成本会计制了。这是社会主义经营上的新东西。这些管理部门，也象车间一样，负有关于减低与之有关的成本因素的任务。企业的供给部门转至实行成本会计制，是具有重要意义的。大家都知道，企业在物资供给上没有应有的制度，常常造成巨大的损失，及流动资本的周转速度因建立多余的物资储存而延缓。
    　　　×  　　×  　　　×
    我们党对于发扬与巩固成本会计制一贯是认为非常重要的。在争取提前完成战后五年计划的全民斗争中，党的组织应该严格地以斯大林同志的著名指示为指南，这指示便是：“发扬并巩固成本会计制度，提高工业内部的资金积累，任务便是如此。”布尔塞维克党正在不懈地执行斯大林的这一指示，引导着苏维埃人民走向苏联经济与文化的新繁荣。
