　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 21st: TASS Delhi dispatch: The United States is intensifying its propaganda to Marshallize India. Almost one-third of all materials published by the U.S. Embassy in India promote the "achievements" of the Marshall Plan in Western European countries. They are trying to prove the necessity of applying the Marshall Plan to South Asian and Southeast Asian countries. Walter White, Secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in the United States, who is currently in India, declared in Delhi that if an alliance of Asian countries is formed to eliminate all trade and tariff barriers, the United States can provide effective assistance to Asian countries.
