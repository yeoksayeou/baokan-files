Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: TASS, Moscow: P. P. Pislak, Vice-Chairman of the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee, wrote an article in *Komsomolskaya Pravda* entitled "The Congress of Young Peace Fighters," stating: The Second World Youth Congress will open in Budapest on September 2nd this year. Representatives of millions of young men and women of all countries fighting under the banner of the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) will participate in this congress. The congress will discuss the activities of the WFDY and its tasks in the struggle for peace, democracy, national independence, and a better future for youth. The congress will also elect the leadership of the WFDY. In all corners of the world, democratic youth are active fighters for the cause of peace and against the attempts of British and American imperialists to incite a new war. Democratic youth are uniting more closely around the WFDY, in anticipation of the Second World Youth Congress. In the four years of its existence, the WFDY has developed into a huge force against the attempts of imperialists to undermine the unity of the younger generation.

	With the overall growth of the forces of peace and democracy, the ranks of the WFDY have also grown and strengthened. When the WFDY was founded, it had only 30 million members. Now it has about 60 million young men and women in 63 countries.

	Pislak continued: The unity of democratic youth is a source of distress for the enemies of peace and progress. The ruling groups in capitalist countries are attempting to suppress democratic youth organizations in their respective countries. However, despite police retaliation and persecution, British and American democratic youth are building friendship and cooperation with democratic youth in other countries and with the WFDY.

	Soviet youth are playing an active role in the activities of the WFDY, resolutely consolidating friendship and unity with democratic youth around the world.

	Young men and women of all countries consider Soviet youth to be models of loyal service to the cause of peace and friendship among nations.

	The contacts between Soviet youth and youth of other countries are developing and strengthening. Delegations from 92 foreign youth organizations have visited our country at the invitation of the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee. They have had every opportunity to understand the life, work, study, and entertainment of Soviet youth, and have recognized the limitless possibilities for development that the Lenin-Stalin Party provides to our youth. More than 50 Soviet young men and women delegations have visited their foreign friends. The Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee maintains contact with youth organizations in more than 70 countries.

	Now, Soviet youth are actively preparing to participate in the World Youth Congress and the International Youth Day. Amateur groups from various enterprises and educational institutions, young professional actors, artists, writers, and composers are preparing to participate in this Youth Day, and a large number of Soviet student-athletes will participate in the competitions.

    共青真理报论世界青年代表大会
    【新华社北平三日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联青年反法西斯委员会副主席彼斯拉克以“青年和平战士的代表大会”为题，在共青真理报著文写道：第二届世界青年代表大会将于今年九月二日在布达佩斯开幕。团结在世界青联旗帜下进行斗争的千百万的各国男女青年，都将有代表参加这次大会。大会将讨论世界青联的活动及其在为和平、民主、民族独立与青年较好前途的斗争中的任务。大会也将选出世界民主青年联盟的领导机构。在全世界各角落里，民主青年都是为和平事业与反对英美帝国主义者煽动新战争的企图的积极斗士。民主青年更紧密地团结在联盟的周围，迎接第二届世界青年代表大会，该联盟在它存在的四年间，就已发展成为反对帝国主义者企图破坏年青一代团结的巨大力量。
    随着和平与民主力量的总增长，世界民主青年联盟的队伍也发展与壮大了。在该联盟成立时，只有三千万盟员，而现在它的盟员已约有六十三个国家的六千万男女青年。
    彼斯拉克继写道：民主青年的团结，正是和平与进步的敌人的苦恼。资本主义各国的统治集团企图镇压各该国的民主青年组织。然而，尽管有着警察的报复与迫害，英美民主青年正在建立对其他国家民主青年及对世界民主青年联盟的友谊与合作。
    苏联青年在联盟的活动中起着积极的作用。坚决巩固与全世界民主青年的友谊与团结。
    世界各国的男女青年，认为苏联青年是忠心耿耿服务于和平事业与各国友谊的模范。
    苏联青年与其他各国青年的联系，正在发展与加强。有九十二个外国青年组织的代表团曾应苏联青年反法西斯委员会之邀，访问了我国。他们有一切的可能来了解苏联青年的生活、劳动、学习与娱乐，并且已经认识到列宁斯大林党提供给我国青年的无限发展的可能性。并有五十多个苏联男女青年代表团访问了他们的国外朋友。苏联青年反法西斯委员会与世界七十余国的青年组织保持着联系。
    现在，苏联青年正在积极准备参加世界青年代表大会及国际青年节。各企业与各教育机关的业余团体。青年职业演员、艺术家、作家与作曲家，都正在准备参加这次青年节，并有大批苏联学生——运动员将参加比赛。
