    Working Class Takes the Lead in Overcoming Difficulties
    Shanghai Workers Save Gasoline and Raw Materials
    [This Newspaper News] Shanghai News: In order to smash the enemy's blockade and build a new Shanghai, since mid-July, the city's workers have responded to the people's government's call for production and economy, concentrating all their efforts to develop production, and have achieved results. Workers in the Power Section of the power plant organized an investigation team to find out about electricity theft and the installation of electric furnaces; after the power plant saved electricity, electricity consumption immediately decreased from 4,050 degrees to more than 3,700 degrees, and after reducing the use of elevators, 200 degrees of electricity can be saved every day. After inventory, employees of the Telecommunications Bureau discovered many past waste and corruption phenomena, and now they have organized a Materials Sorting Committee to clean up the warehouse. The Public Transportation Company originally had 20 official vehicles, consuming more than 1,200 gallons of gasoline per month. Now, the employees there have jointly initiated a reduction in official vehicles to save fuel, and have changed their summer clothing to coarse cloth, following the example of the People's Liberation Army. On the 12th, the oil tanker company stopped all seven of its cars, leaving only one jeep for public use, which is estimated to save 17 gallons of gasoline per day. The China Textile Corporation has decided to simplify procedures in its management work, strive for speed, conduct precise investigations and allocations, and absolutely prevent waste and disconnections from occurring; in terms of manpower, it will reduce redundant agencies and redundant personnel, and in terms of materials, it will minimize waste, such as reducing the use of transportation vehicles, etc., so that gasoline has been reduced from 800 gallons per week to 400 gallons per week recently. Employees of the 17th Factory voluntarily canceled transportation vehicles, saving 100 gallons of gasoline per month. The dyeing and printing third factory replaced 100 light bulbs with 60, and abolished electric water heating, which has saved 40% of electricity compared to the past. The boiler room of the Original Power Department used to burn 1.5 tons of coal per day, but now it uses broken seeds for burning, saving all 1.5 tons of coal, saving about 7 million yuan per month. The winding yarn room makes full use of winding feet, saving 500-600 pounds of winding yarn per month. Instead of using small flour for sizing yarn, its own rotten slurry is used, saving 900 bags of flour per month. In terms of saving raw materials, the silk spinning factory now adds a layer of iron fence to the crossing in the refining room, so that raw materials are not lost, which has saved 100 catties of raw materials per day compared to the past. Workers in the leather roller room of the 19th Factory put forward research in the technical group. According to statistics, the average monthly consumption of new belts (types 5/2 and 3) in the first half of the year was 1,300 feet. In July, it was decided to reduce it by 45% and make full use of old leather for remanufacturing. Employees of the Unified Yarn Factory, Central Electrical Factory No. 2, Asia Steel Factory, Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Jianguo Road Vehicle Registration Office, "Post-War Rehabilitation and Custody Committee," and Material Supply Office have also taken action to vigorously carry out the economy movement.
