　　List of Reactionary Party and League Elements
  　To Be Published Gradually Starting Today
    Those Who Are Unrepentant Will Be Severely Punished; Those Who Sincerely Repent Will Be Treated Leniently
    [News from this city] Since the registration of reactionary party and league elements in Ping City began, nearly three thousand people have registered at the registration offices of the Municipal Public Security Bureau in accordance with the methods stipulated in the Military Control Commission's proclamation. In order to implement Chairman Mao's instruction in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "To exercise dictatorship over the running dogs of imperialism, namely the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, as well as the Kuomintang reactionaries and their accomplices who represent these classes, to oppress these people, to only allow them to behave themselves, and not allow them to talk or act乱. If they want to talk or act乱, they should be immediately banned and sanctioned." In order to distinguish between those reactionary party and league members who are unrepentant and should be suppressed, and those who are willing to turn over a new leaf and should be treated leniently, and to enable people from all walks of life to distinguish between right and wrong, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and to supervise reactionary party and league members in a timely manner to prevent them from continuing to do evil, and to help them make progress, honestly bow their heads to the people, and be good citizens of a new democratic country, the bureau will publish the list of registered reactionary elements to the people starting today. Some of the registered reactionary party and league elements have thoroughly confessed and repented, and handed over reactionary organizations, documents, archives, radio stations, weapons, etc.; however, a large number are extremely cunning, only superficially fulfilling the registration procedures, avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial, or even carrying out false registration, attempting to deceive and refusing to thoroughly confess their crimes, thoroughly hand over their reactionary organizations, archives, weapons and radio stations, etc., and attempting to use registration as a shield to secretly continue their sabotage activities, and some have not yet registered at the registration office, hoping to hide and continue to do evil. In order to implement the spirit of the Ping City All-Circles Representatives Conference to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements to consolidate revolutionary order and protect the safety of people's lives and property, the Municipal Public Security Bureau will strictly deal with reactionary party and league members who are stubbornly unrepentant and refuse to bow their heads to the people based on material evidence; for those who surrender and register, thoroughly confess, and thoroughly hand over all reactionary organizations, documents, archives, radio stations and weapons, and for those who sincerely repent, the People's Government may, based on the actual situation, deal with them leniently and give them the opportunity to start anew.

　　反动党团分子名单
  　今起陆续公布
    怙恶不悛分子即予严办真诚悔过者将宽大处理
    【本市讯】平市反动党团分子自开始登记以来，迄今已有近三千名遵照军管会布告办法，向市公安局各登记处进行登记。该局为贯彻毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中所指示的：“向着帝国主义的走狗即地主阶级和官僚资产阶级以及代表这些阶级的国民党反动派及其帮凶们实行专政，实行独裁，压迫这些人，只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。如要乱说乱动，立即取缔，予以制裁。”为了区别反动党团人员中，那些是怙恶不悛的分子，应予以镇压，而那些是愿意改邪归正的分子，应予以宽大，并使各界人民，分清是非，分清敌我，对反动党团分子及时加以监督，免其继续为非作恶，并帮助其进步，老老实实向人民低头，好好做一个新民主主义国家的公民，特于今日起将已登记的反动分子名单，陆续公布于人民之前。现已登记的反动党团分子，有些已彻底坦白悔过，交出反动组织、证件、档案、电台、武器等；尚有一大部分狡诈异常，仅在表面上履行了登记手续，避重就轻，甚至进行假登记，企图蒙混，不肯彻底坦白其罪行，彻底交出其反动组织、档案、武器及电台等，并企图以登记为护身符，暗中继续其破坏活动，并有一部分迄未到登记处登记，希图隐藏，继续为恶。市公安局为贯彻平市各界代表会议肃清反革命分子以巩固革命秩序保障人民生命财产安全之精神，对于执迷不悟，坚持不肯向人民低头的反动党团分子，即根据材料证据，严格处理；对于投案登记彻底坦白，彻底交出所有的全部反动组织、证件、档案、电台及武器等的分子，对于真诚悔过的分子，人民政府尚可依据实际情况，宽大处理，给予重新作人的机会。
