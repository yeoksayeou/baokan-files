    North China People's Government Instruction
    Inspect Substitute Farming to Guarantee Autumn Harvest
    [Ping City News] In order to inspect substitute farming and strengthen ties with the army, the North China People's Government issued instructions to governments at all levels on August 4th. The instruction pointed out: This work should be regarded as one of the main contents of civil affairs work for governments at all levels in August and September. Regarding the inspection of substitute farming, the instructions stated: At present, the Beginning of Autumn has arrived, and the Limit of Heat is approaching. The weeding of autumn crops has been completed, and early-maturing crops are about to be or have already been harvested (such as spring corn, millet, and early-maturing millet). All localities should promptly check the growth of crops belonging to revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and industrial workers as evidence of this year's organization of production and substitute farming work for revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and industrial workers. Those that are doing well should be encouraged, and those that are doing poorly should be criticized, and methods for improvement should be studied. In areas affected by floods, efforts should be made to organize and assist the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and industrial workers to rush-plant vegetables and buckwheat in conjunction with replanting efforts. During the process, attention should be paid to solving their seed, fertilizer, and other problems; in particular, substitute farming households should be educated to prevent and overcome the idea that "helping revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and industrial workers replant vegetables and buckwheat is an extra burden." In order to ensure that the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and industrial workers plant more wheat, it is necessary to combine this with the manure accumulation movement, calling on and helping the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and industrial workers to cut a large amount of grass to press into green manure. Before wheat fields are sown, an inspection of manure accumulation by military dependents should be carried out; during autumn plowing and wheat planting, deep plowing, careful cultivation, and the application of more fertilizer must be guaranteed.
    Regarding the issue of strengthening ties with the army, the instructions pointed out: In the past, local authorities failed to respond promptly to written opinions and inquiries submitted by the army. Governments at all levels should conduct a thorough review of this. From now on, all localities should increase contact with the army, do more to introduce the work of supporting the army to the army, and in particular, promptly sign and reply to inquiries from the army and the handling process of the issues raised; or provide explanations for the opinions raised.

    华北人民政府指示
    检查代耕保证秋收
    【平市讯】为检查代耕和加强与军队联系的工作，华北人民政府特于八月四日向各级政府发出指示。指出：该项工作应作为各级政府八、九月份民政工作主要内容之一。关于检查代耕工作，指示称：目前立秋已到，处暑即来，大秋作物已完成锄草，早熟庄稼将要或已该收割（如春玉茭、黍子、早熟谷子等），各地应迅速检查烈、军、工属庄稼长的好坏，作为今年组织烈、军、工属生产和代耕工作的鉴证。对好的应予以鼓励，坏的给以批评，并研究改进办法。部分遭水灾地区，应结合补种工作，组织并帮助烈、军、工属赶种菜蔬、乔麦。进行中，应注意解决其种籽、肥料等问题；尤应教育代耕户，防止与克服认为“帮助烈、军、工属补种菜蔬、乔麦，是额外负担”的想法。为了保证烈、军、工属多种麦，务须结合压肥运动，号召并帮助烈、军、工属大量割草压绿肥。并应于麦田播种前进行军属积肥检查；秋耕种麦时，保证做到深耕细作多施肥料。
    关于加强与军队联系问题，指示指出：过去军队方面向地方上提出的书面意见和询问函件，各地未能做到及时答复，此点，各级政府均应作深刻检讨。今后，各地应多与军队联系，多向军队做优军工作的介绍，特别应及时签复军队来函所询问题及该问题的处理经过；或对所提意见予以解释。
