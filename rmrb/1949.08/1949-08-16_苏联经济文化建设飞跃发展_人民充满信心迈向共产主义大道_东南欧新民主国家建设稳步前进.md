In stark contrast to the capitalist world's declining production, soaring unemployment, and tragic impoverishment of the people, the economic and cultural construction of the socialist Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are progressing rapidly. According to a TASS report on August 9th, the average daily total output of Soviet industry in June this year has exceeded 41% of the pre-war level of 1940. According to the provisions of the post-war Five-Year Plan, by 1950, the average daily total output of industry will increase by 48% compared with 1940. That is to say, in terms of the average daily total output of industry, Soviet industry is rapidly approaching the target of the last year of the post-war Five-Year Plan. The continuous surge in socialist industrial production provides a reliable guarantee for the pre-term completion of the Five-Year Plan. In agriculture, large-scale agricultural electrification projects, plans to develop irrigation systems, two-year afforestation plans, and three-year plans to develop livestock breeding are accelerating. Along with the surge in industrial and agricultural production, the transportation industry has also made similar progress. Railway lines are constantly being extended, and electrified railways are constantly increasing. Soviet railway workers recently assured Stalin that the volume of transportation in the third quarter of this year will reach the level of 1950, that is to say, the transportation volume of Soviet railways will exceed three times the total pre-war railway transportation volume of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan. The Soviet Union currently has more than 100,000 kilometers of inland waterways, exceeding the total of inland waterways in the United States, Germany, Britain, and Italy. Last year, 70% of the loading and unloading work in inland waterway transportation was mechanized. With the development of economic construction, the cultural and educational undertakings of the Soviet Union are also advancing by leaps and bounds. After the entrance examinations for schools at all levels began on August 1st, 1.9 million new students will enter higher education institutions this autumn. Primary schools, seven-year schools, and secondary schools across the country will accommodate a total of 34 million students. Universal seven-year compulsory education will soon be realized in the next school year. The development of socialist economy and culture marks the Soviet people's confident stride on the road to communism.

In the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe, construction work is progressing steadily. Hungary has successfully completed its economic plan for the first half of this year. Industrial production exceeded the plan by 3.5%, and the plan to organize machine and tractor stations was 87% completed in the first half of the year, fulfilling the annual plan. At the beginning of this year, Hungary's industrial production had reached 127% of the pre-war level of 1938. Now, the Hungarian working people are guaranteeing that the three-year plan will be completed in two years and five months. Since the implementation of industrial nationalization in Bulgaria in December 1947, industrial production has significantly increased. In 1948, industrial production increased by 71.5% compared with the pre-war level of 1939. Poland expects a bumper harvest, and after the new grain is stored, there will be the first large surplus since the war. Romania's agriculture has taken another step forward on the road to socialism, and the first batch of collective farms has recently been established, which will pave the way for large-scale agricultural collectivization in the future. The achievements of the people's democratic countries are inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union. At the beginning of August, a special article in Pravda commenting on the achievements of the Hungarian working people stated: "Loyalty to the ideas of proletarian internationalism, inviolable friendship with the Soviet Union, and learning to apply the Soviet Union's experience in building socialism under Hungarian conditions constitute the foundation of Hungary's democratic achievements."

American Warmongers' War Preparations Hit by Angry Blows from the People of Europe

The U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force Chiefs of Staff, who went to Europe carrying the mission of U.S. imperialist aggression and war plans, met with a loud response from the European people: Get out! In recent weeks, the people's movement to combat the war-mongers' war preparations has been raging everywhere. On the 5th, the working people of Paris held a demonstration to protest the arrival in Paris of the American Chiefs of Staff to discuss the so-called "Western European Defense Committee." Demonstrators shouted "Bradley, go back to New York!" "Montgomery, go back to London!" in front of the American Embassy where the warmongers were meeting. The French government dispatched 15,000 military police, even cavalry, artillery, and aircraft to suppress the demonstration, but it could not shake the determination of the people of Paris to demonstrate. On the 7th, the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force Chiefs of Staff went to Vienna from Paris and received the same reception. Austrian Communist Party Chairman Koplenig said at a mass meeting celebrating the Austrian Communist Party newspaper that these American generals should be made to "go back where they came from." The next day, the Austrian people held a demonstration outside the hotel where the warmongers were staying. At the same time, the Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party passed a resolution condemning the government's approval of the North Atlantic Treaty and calling on the people to fight for peace. In Germany, the German People's Council is also actively preparing for the all-German demonstration scheduled for Peace Day on September 1st. In Latin America, the Cuban National Congress for Peace and Democracy was held in Havana from the 6th to the 7th, with more than 2,000 representatives from all walks of life attending the conference. The conference passed a resolution supporting the declaration of the Paris Congress for World Peace and refuting the fallacy that war is inevitable. The American Congress for Peace, scheduled to be held in Mexico City on September 5th, is actively preparing. The invitation to the conference pointed out that the purpose of the conference is to "unite the people of the Americas to express their desire for peace, will, and strength." The strength of the people all over the world to oppose war and strive for peace is the main and insurmountable obstacle that U.S. imperialism encounters in carrying out its war preparations. At the same time, within the imperialist camp, among the Western European countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty, contradictions are intensifying. U.S. imperialism wants to turn European countries into slaves it hires, while the British ruling group wants to turn France into its hired slave first. There is no real friendship and cooperation between master and slave. The U.S. imperialists' attempt to supply Western Europe with military equipment, to make Western Europe serve as the main provider of cannon fodder for U.S. imperialism, is not a satisfactory scheme, as Izvestia pointed out: it "can only arouse new and more powerful waves of popular indignation."

The Royalist Fascist government in Athens, under the direction and direct command of U.S. imperialism, launched an offensive against the Greek Democratic Army in the Grammos Mountains in northwestern Greece on August 2nd. The Royalist Fascist army concentrated almost all of its regular army on the Grammos-Vitsi line, attempting to make a desperate move. Fierce fighting continues. The first few days of the war showed the strength and preparation of the Democratic Army. The Royalist Fascist army launched multiple offensives with the support of U.S.-supplied artillery and aircraft, but they were all repelled by the Democratic Army. According to the Democratic Army Headquarters' communique on the 8th, all the positions occupied by the Royalist Fascist army in the eastern Grammos were driven out by the Democratic Army. The Democratic Army launched a counterattack, pursuing and annihilating the enemy. The enemy troops in the western Grammos also suffered heavy casualties. The morale of the Royalist Fascist army was low. Despite the dispatch of military police to supervise the battle, desertions increased daily. The Democratic Army was in high spirits. The Democratic Army Headquarters issued an order on the 4th, calling on the defense of every inch of land in Grammos, and pointed out that "the battle to defend the Grammos Mountains will become the turning point of 1949 and will pave the way for the liberation of the motherland."

U.S. Imperialism Admits Utter Failure of its China Policy; Directing "Pacific Alliance" Faces Many Difficulties

On the 5th of this month, the U.S. State Department issued a white paper on "U.S. Relations with China" of more than 1,000 pages, which reluctantly admitted that the U.S. imperialist government's policy of aggression against China and interference in China's internal affairs has completely failed. When discussing the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War led by the Chinese Communist Party, the white paper admitted that "this is the product of internal forces in China." Regarding the development of this internal force in China, "the United States has tried to influence it, but cannot effectively do so." The white paper said: "The unfortunate (!) result of the Chinese civil war was beyond the control of the U.S. government. Could the U.S. have changed this result by what it had done or could have done within the reasonable limits of its capabilities? What the U.S. did not do had no impact on this result." The white paper clearly stated that the U.S. imperialist government is the mortal enemy of the new people's democratic China. The white paper said: In order to overthrow the results that the development of internal forces in China has now reached, the U.S. government will encourage all developments of factors aimed at overthrowing the new people's democratic China. Acheson also issued a special statement on August 6th, the day after the white paper was released, putting forward five new principles for aggression against China and interference in China's internal affairs, including the U.S. will "consult" with other imperialist countries that own colonies in the Far East on ways to deal with the new people's democratic China. The white paper is a new declaration of war by the U.S. imperialist government against the Chinese people. All those who still harbor the illusion that U.S. imperialism will lay down its butcher knife and wholeheartedly turn to good should learn a due lesson from the white paper, that is, the only way out is to smash any aggression plan and action of U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people have done this in the past, are doing this now, and will certainly do this in the future.

The conspiracy to form a "Pacific Alliance" is continuing tensely as the U.S. white paper announces continued interference in China and encourages reactionary ruling groups in Asian countries to form an alliance. Bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek flew to Jinhae, South Korea, on the 6th, held two days of talks with South Korean puppet President Syngman Rhee, and issued a joint communique on the 8th, calling on Quirino, who was meeting with Truman in Washington, to take all necessary steps to promote the realization of the "alliance." At the same time, another Kuomintang bandit leader, Wu Tiecheng, went to Tokyo on the 12th to begin his trip to Japan and South Korea, secretly working to recruit Japanese and Korean "volunteers" and sell the sovereignty of Taiwan, carrying out the criminal act of betraying the motherland and colluding with foreign enemies. In Washington, Quirino's clamor in the U.S. Senate about "organizing a Pacific Alliance to fight against communism" has won Truman's public support, guaranteeing that he will not return empty-handed. However, the efforts of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to organize this "alliance" are facing serious difficulties, that is, the people of various Far Eastern countries have greatly improved their awareness and organization in many years of liberation struggle. The Chinese people's revolutionary forces have become unprecedentedly strong, and the people of other countries, especially encouraged by the victory of the Chinese people in defeating U.S. imperialism and its dog Kuomintang reactionaries, are more determined and confident in their struggle. And the traitors in various countries under the protection of imperialism appear extremely fragile. Even Romulo could not help but admit that the reactionaries in Asian countries are a "motley crew." In his speech in the U.S. Senate, Quirino also admitted that the relevant Asian countries "face numerous difficulties."

### 苏联经济文化建设飞跃发展  人民充满信心迈向共产主义大道  东南欧新民主国家建设稳步前进

　　苏联经济文化建设飞跃发展
    人民充满信心迈向共产主义大道
    东南欧新民主国家建设稳步前进
    与资本主义世界的生产下降、失业激增、人民贫困化的悲惨图景恰恰相反，社会主义苏联和人民民主国家的经济建设，文化建设正在突飞猛进中。据塔斯社八月九日报道，今年六月份苏联工业每日平均总产量已超过战前一九四○年的百分之四十一；按照战后五年计划的规定，到一九五○年，工业每日平均总产量将比一九四○年增加百分之四十八；这就是说，就工业的每日平均总产量来说，苏联工业正迅速接近战后五年计划最后一年的目标。社会主义工业生产的不断高涨为五年计划的前提完成提供了可靠的保证。在农业方面，大规模农业电气化计划、发展灌溉系统的计划、两年造林计划和发展牲畜饲养的三年计划，正加速进行。与工农业生产高涨的同时，运输业方面也有同样的进展。铁路线正不断地伸展，电气化的铁路也在不断增加。苏联铁路职工最近又向斯大林保证在今年第三季的运载量达到一九五○年的水平，也就是说，将使苏联铁路的运输量，超过英、法、德、意、日五国战前铁路运输量总和的三倍。苏联现有内河航线在十万公里以上，超过了美、德、英、意等国内河航线的总和。内河航运的装卸工作，在去年即已有百分之七十机械化。随着经济建设的发展，苏联文化教育事业也在飞跃地前进。各级学校于八月一日开始举行入学考试后，今年秋季将有一百九十万新生进入高等教育机关、全国初等学校、七年制学校和中等学校将一共容纳三千四百万学生，下一学年即将实现普遍的七年强迫教育。社会主义经济与文化的发展标志了苏联人民充满信心地在过渡到共产主义的大道上迈进。
    在东欧、东南欧的人民民主国家里，建设工作正稳步前进中。匈牙利胜利地完成了今年上半年的经济计划。工业生产超过计划百分之三点五、组织机器与拖拉机站的计划，上半年就完成了全年计划的百分之八十七。在今年年初，匈牙利的工业生产已达到战前一九三八年的百分之一百二十七。现在，匈牙利劳动人民正保证将在两年零五个月内完成三年计划。保加利亚自一九四七年十二月实行工业国有化以来，工业生产量已有显著提高，一九四八年工业生产量较战前一九三九年增加了百分之七十一点五。波兰丰收有望，新谷入仓后将有战后第一次的大量剩余储存。罗马尼亚的农业，在走向社会主义的道路上又向前迈进了一步，最近已成立了第一批集体农场，这将为今后大规模农业集体化开创道路。人民民主国家的成就是与苏联的帮助分不开的。八月初真理报专文评匈牙利劳动人民的成就说：“对无产阶级国际主义思想的忠诚不可侵犯的对苏友谊，学习在匈牙利的条件下运用苏联建设社会主义的经验，这些构成了匈牙利民主成就的基础。”
    美国战争贩子备战活动遭到全欧人民愤怒打击
    负着美帝国主义侵略和战争计划的使命赴欧的美国陆、海、空军参谋长，遇到了欧洲人民响亮的回答：滚回去！打击战争贩子备战活动的人民运动，近周来正如火如荼地到处展开着。五日巴黎劳动人民举行示威，抗议到巴黎来与所谓“西欧防御委员会”会商的美国的参谋长们。示威者就在战贩们开会的美国大使馆前高呼“布莱德雷滚回纽约去！”“蒙哥马利滚回伦敦去！”法国政府出动一万五千名的军警，甚至骑兵、炮兵与飞机来镇压，并不能动摇巴黎人民示威的决心。七日美陆海空军参谋长自巴黎赴维也纳，也受到了同样的接待。奥共主席柯普利尼希在庆祝奥共报纸的群众大会上说，要让这些美国将军们“滚回来的地方去”。第二天，奥地利人民更在战贩们所住的旅馆外面举行了示威。与此同时，荷兰共产党中央委员会通过决议，斥责政府批准北大西洋公约，号召人民为和平而奋斗。在德国，德意志人民委员会也正在积极进行业已定于九月一日和平日举行的全德大示威的筹备工作。在拉丁美洲，古巴全国拥护和平与民主大会于六日至七日在哈瓦那举行，出席大会的各界代表达二千余人。大会通过决议支持巴黎拥护世界和平大会宣言，驳斥战争不可避免的谬论。定于九月五日在墨西哥城召开的美洲拥护和平大会正在积极筹备中，大会邀请书指出大会的宗旨在使“美洲人民团结起来表示他们渴望和平的意志和力量”。全世界人民反对战争，争取和平的力量乃是美帝国主义在进行其备战活动时所碰到的不可克服的主要障碍。同时，在帝国主义阵营内部，在参加北大西洋公约的西欧国家之间，矛盾正在严重化。美帝国主义想把欧洲各国变成他们所雇用的奴仆，而英国的统治集团则首先想把法国变成自己所雇用的奴仆，主人和奴仆之间，并没有真正友谊与合作可言。美帝国主义者企图以军事装备供给西欧，要西欧充当美帝国主义的主要炮灰供给者，这种罪恶的勾当并不是称心如意的，正如消息报所指出：它“只能引起新的、更有力的人民愤慨的浪潮”。
    雅典保皇法西斯政府在美帝国主义指使和直接指挥下于八月二日起在希腊西北部的格拉姆斯山区对希腊民主军发动攻势。保皇法西斯军在格拉姆斯至维齐一线上集中几乎全部正规军企图孤注一掷，激战继续中。最初几天的战争就显示了民主军的力量与准备。保皇法西斯军在美国供给的大炮与飞机支援下举行多次进攻，均为民主军击退。据民主军总部八日公报称：保皇法西斯军在格拉姆斯东部所占阵地全部被民主军所部逐出。民主军并举行反击，追歼敌军。格拉姆斯西部敌军亦受重大伤亡。保皇法西斯军士气沮丧，尽管派宪兵队督战，逃亡日众。民主军则士气昂扬，民主军总部于四日发布命令，号召保卫格拉姆斯每一英寸土地，并指出“格拉姆斯山的保卫战，将成为一九四九年的转捩点，并将为解放祖国开辟道路”。
    美帝招认侵华政策惨败　导演“太平洋联盟”困难多
    本月五日美国务院发表了一篇题为“中美关系”长达一千多页的白皮书，无可奈何地供认了美国帝国主义政府侵略中国、干涉中国内政的政策业已全盘失败。白皮书在论到中国共产党所领导的中国人民解放战争的胜利时，承认“这是中国内部势力的产物”，对于中国这种内部势力的发展，“美国曾试图加以影响，但不能有效”。白皮书说：“中国内战的不幸（！）结果为美国政府控制所不及。美国在她能力的合理限度之内，所曾经做或能够做的能不能改变这个结果。美国所未做的对于这个结果也没有影响。”白皮书明白表示美国帝国主义政府是人民民主新中国的死敌。白皮书说：美国政府为了推翻中国内部势力的发展现时所已达到的结果，将鼓励以推翻人民民主新中国为目的之因素的一切发展。艾奇逊并于白皮书公布的第二天即八月六日发表专门的声明，提出侵略中国、干涉中国内政的五项新原则，其中包括美国将与其他在远东拥有殖民地的帝国主义国家“咨商”对付人民民主新中国的办法。白皮书就是美国帝国主义政府对于中国人民的新的战争宣言。所有还抱有希望美帝国主义放下屠刀、同心向善的幻想的人，应该从白皮书中得到应有的教训，这就是只有把美帝国主义的任何一点侵略计划和行动打得粉碎才是出路。中国人民过去这样做了，现在正这样做，将来也一定这样做。
    筹组“太平洋联盟”的阴谋活动，在美国白皮书宣布继续干涉中国及鼓励亚洲国家反动统治集团结成联盟之际，正在紧张地继续着。匪首蒋介石于六日飞抵南朝鲜的镇海后，与南朝鲜傀儡总统李承晚进行两日的会谈，并于八日发表联合公报，呼吁正在华盛顿会见杜鲁门的季里诺，采取一切必要步骤，以促成“联盟”的实现。同时，国民党另一匪首吴铁城又于十二日去东京，开始其日本与南朝鲜的旅行，暗地为招募日、韩“志愿军”及拍卖台湾主权奔走，进行出卖祖国，勾结外寇的罪恶勾当。在华盛顿，季里诺在美国参院中关于“组织太平洋联盟以与共产主义斗争”的叫嚣，已博得杜鲁门的公开支持，保证他决不会空手而回。但是，美帝国主义及其走卒组织这种“联盟”的努力，正面临着严重的困难，这就是远东各国人民在多年的解放斗争中大大提高了自己的觉悟性和组织性。中国人民革命力量已空前强大，而其他国家人民，特别受到中国人民击败美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派的胜利的鼓舞，斗争的决心与信心更加坚强。而在帝国主义卵翼下的各国卖国贼则显得极其脆弱。连罗慕洛也不能不承认，亚洲各国反动派乃是一群“乌合之众”。季里诺在美国参院演说中，也承认亚洲有关各国“困难重重”。
