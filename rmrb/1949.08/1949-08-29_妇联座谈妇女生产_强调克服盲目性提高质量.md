　　[This Municipality News] The Preparatory Committee of the Democratic Women's Federation of Beiping Municipality, in order to implement the resolutions of the All-Circles Representative Conference, further promote women's production, and welcome the Asian Women's Conference, held a symposium at the All-China Democratic Women's Federation at 1:00 PM on the 27th to listen to opinions from all parties. Attendees included cadres from women's production work in various districts, heads of women's cooperatives, and Gao Yuming, manager of the trading company. Zhang Xiaomei, director of the Women's Federation, presided over the discussion. Everyone spoke enthusiastically and clearly recognized several issues: (1) The issue of planning in production. In the past, women's production in this city took a blind and unplanned detour. In the future, we must do our best to overcome this and ensure that production is adapted to consumption. (2) The issue of improving technology to ensure improved quality. This is an important issue. Recently, a production team in one district undertook to make 1,000 sets of military uniforms, but more than 800 sets did not meet the specifications and were returned for rework. This shows that failure to strive to improve technology will inevitably hinder the development of women's production. (3) Production should be developed with emphasis based on actual conditions. It is wrong for all districts to engage in the same production or for one district to engage in all kinds of production. Subsequently, everyone requested that women's production units should have more contact and cooperation in the future, and that the Municipal Women's Federation, the Cooperative General Agency, and the Trading Company should also combine and lead in a unified manner. Gao Yuming, manager of the Trading Company, also put forward two suggestions: First, he cited many examples, emphasizing the importance of improving technology to ensure quality improvement. Only by ensuring quality can the Trading Company for socks, towels, and knitted goods continue to exchange. In the future, women's production should strive to achieve standardization, and cooperatives should cooperate with factories with technology. Second, he agreed with the Municipal Women's Federation's opinion of combining production with organizing the masses, and agreed that in the future, all production suitable for women should be led by the Women's Federation. Finally, Zhang Xiaomei, director of the Women's Federation, concluded by saying: At present, there are many difficulties in women's production in Beiping. We must have the spirit to persevere, do as much work as we can with the strength we have, especially in terms of technology. Do not just forgive ourselves and ask others to take care of us. We must grit our teeth and overcome the difficulties.

　　妇联座谈妇女生产
  　强调克服盲目性提高质量
    【本市讯】北平市民主妇联筹委会为了执行各界代表会议的决议，进一步推进妇女生产，并迎接亚洲妇女会议，二十七日下午一时假全国民主妇联召开座谈会，听取各方意见。到会者有各区妇女生产工作干部，各妇女合作社负责人及贸易公司高玉明经理。由妇联主任张晓梅主持讨论，大家热烈发言，明确的认识了几个问题：（一）生产计划性问题。过去本市妇女生产走了一段盲目无计划的弯路，今后必须全力克服，做到生产与消费相适应。（二）提高技术保证改进质量问题。这是一个重要问题。最近有一个区生产小组承做一千套军服，结果有八百多套不合规格，退回重做。这说明了如不力求提高技术，必将障碍妇女生产的发展。（三）应根据实际情况有重点地发展生产，各区都搞同一生产或一个区里什么生产都搞，都是不对的。继而大家要求各妇女生产单位今后要多联系、多配合，市妇联与合作总社、贸易公司也要互相结合，统一领导。贸易公司高玉明经理也提出了两点意见：第一，他举了许多例子，强调提高技术保证质量改进的重要性，只有保证质量，袜子、毛巾及针织品贸易公司才能继续交换。今后妇女生产要力求做到规格化，各合作社与有技术的工厂要取得配合。第二，他同意市妇联提出的生产与组织群众相结合的意见，并同意今后凡是适合妇女的生产由妇联领导进行。最后妇联主任张晓梅作结论，她说：目前北平妇女生产困难很多，我们要有坚持下去的精神，有多少力量作多少工作，尤其在技术方面，不要只原谅自己，要求别人照顾，必须咬紧牙关，渡过困难才行。
