　　State Farm to be Built on Chabei Grassland
　　200+ Tractors to be Used
　　to Reclaim 200,000 Mu of Land
　　[Chahar News] Construction work on the first large-scale state-run machine farm in the history of the Chabei Grassland has already begun. In mid-July, the North China People's Government decided to establish a state-run machine farm near Gonghui, sixty miles northwest of Zhangbei. At the end of July, the Chahar Provincial Government transferred a group of personnel to begin building offices, worker dormitories, and machine warehouses near Gonghui. On the other hand, a farm machine transfer station was established on Industry Street in Zhangjiakou. On the 16th of this month, the first batch of tractors shipped from Tianjin—ten Alice-style tractors—arrived in Zhangjiakou and will soon be sent to the farm for land reclamation. Currently, other preparations for the farm are actively underway, and more than 200 tractors will be shipped here by next spring. The farm near Gonghui is one of the two planned state-run farms in Chabei, covering an area of approximately 140,000 to 200,000 mu, all of which will be cultivated using machines.

　　察北草原建农场
  　将用两百多部拖拉机
  　垦荒二十万亩
    【察哈尔讯】在察北草原上，有史以来第一个大规模的国营机器农场的建设工作，业已着手进行。七月中旬，华北人民政府决定在张北西北六十里的公会附近建立国营机器农场，察省省府于七月底抽调一部人员，一方面开始在公会附近修建办公室、工人宿舍、机器库房；另方面在张市工业大街设立了农场机器转运站。本月十六日，由天津启运的首批拖拉机——十部阿立斯式拖拉机运抵张垣，不久即将开赴农场开荒压青。现该场其他准备工作正积极进行，二百余部拖拉机将于明春全部运来。公会附近的农场，为计划中的察北两个国营农场中的一个，面积约为十四万亩至二十万亩，全部使用机器耕种。
