    How to Strengthen the Unified Regularization Movement?
    Responsible Comrade of the Political Department of the North China Military Region
    Emphasizes Systematic and Regular Learning
    [This newspaper reports] Today is "August 1st". In order to commemorate the twenty-second anniversary of the birth of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army, this reporter specially visited several responsible comrades of the Political Department of the North China Military Region. They spoke to the reporter about a central issue in the current army building in North China - how to strengthen the unified regularization movement. The main contents are as follows:
    Today, North China has been completely liberated, and the liberation of the whole country is also imminent. The North China People's Liberation Army is entering a new period of regularization and modernization. In order to complete this new task! - To build a modernized and powerful national defense force, strictly speaking, it is not only the task of the army itself, but it also naturally includes the issue of national industrialization; but as far as the army itself is concerned, there is no other method to complete the construction, but to learn. We must study Mao Zedong Thought, study modern military science knowledge, and study culture. In terms of learning methods, because we are already in a position today to conduct systematic and regular learning and also need to do so, we must learn step by step from the beginning. Therefore, our current military education starts with standard drills, political education starts with basic knowledge of the revolution, and cultural education is conducted in regular classes according to proficiency, in order to improve the quality of the troops from the foundation and make the army a huge school for conducting regular education. However, there are still many obstacles in carrying out such education, which must be overcome. The most important of these is that the troops still retain guerrillaism. In the past, under wartime conditions, it was impossible for the troops to conduct long-term training. Often, short-term training was conducted on the battlefield and in campaigns in conjunction with a specific combat mission. Learning and application were immediate, so the method of grabbing a point and conducting a blitz was adopted. Now the conditions have changed, and we are in a relatively stable and concentrated situation, so we should conduct systematic and planned regular education. However, the thinking of some of our troops' cadres and soldiers is still stuck on the past basis. They are not accustomed to regular education and are not familiar with regular teaching methods. Therefore, in carrying out regular education, we must first overcome the guerrilla habits that still remain in the troops. Since the beginning of the training movement in the North China troops, considerable achievements have been made. On August 1st, the troops will conduct an inspection of the training in order to strive for greater efforts in the future to complete the regular construction. (Bai Sheng)

    如何加强统一正规化运动？
    华北军区政治部负责同志
    强调系统正规学习
    【本报讯】今天是“八一”，为了纪念这个伟大的中国人民解放军诞生二十二周年纪念日，记者特走访华北军区政治部几位负责同志，他们向记者谈了目前华北建军的一个中心问题——如何加强统一正规化运动。其主要内容如下：
    今天华北已完全解放，全国解放也已在目前。华北人民解放军，正进入了一个正规化、近代化建设的新时期。为了完成这一新的任务！——建设成为近代化的强大的国防军，严格的讲，不光是军队本身的任务，自然还要包括国家工业化的问题；但就军队本身来说，完成建设的方法，没有别的，就是要学习。必须学习毛泽东思想，学习近代化军事科学知识，学习文化。在学习方法上，由于我们今天已经有条件而且也需要进行有系统的正规的学习，我们就要按步就班的从头学起。因此我们现在军事教育就从制式学起，政治教育从革命的基本知识学起，文化教育按程度分班进行正规的学习，以便从基础上提高部队素养，使军队成为一个进行正规教育的巨大学校。但在进行这样的教育中，还存在不少障碍，必须加以克服。其中最主要的，便是部队还残存着游击主义作风。过去在战争情况下，部队不可能进行长期整训，常常是在战场上、战役中，配合某一特殊战斗任务进行短期训练，随学随用，因之都采用抓取一点，进行突击的方法。现在条件已经改变，我们已处在比较安定和集中的情况下，就应该进行有系统的有计划的正规化教育，但是我们某些部队干部战士的思想还停止在过去那个基础上，他们对正规化教育不习惯，对正规化的教学方法也不熟悉。因此，在进行正规化教育中，首先要克服部队尚残存的游击习气。华北部队练兵运动，自开始以来，已取得相当成绩。八一，各部队将进行对练兵的检查，以求今后更加努力地为完成正规的建设而奋斗。        （柏生）
