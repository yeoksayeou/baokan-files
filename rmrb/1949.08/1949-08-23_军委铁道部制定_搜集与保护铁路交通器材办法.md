　　Military Commission Railway Department Formulates
　　Measures for Collecting and Protecting Railway Traffic Equipment
    In order to support the front lines, ensure the supply and transport for the advancing armies, and develop the economy, it is necessary to rapidly repair railway traffic facilities in large quantities. To solve the difficulty of lacking materials, the Military Commission Railway Department has specifically formulated "Measures for Collecting and Protecting Railway Traffic Equipment," which has been approved and promulgated by the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission. All soldiers and civilians throughout the country should uniformly assist the railway bureaus in collecting railway traffic equipment preserved by the people, stored by public and private institutions, and circulating in the market, and handing it over to the railway bureaus to ensure the rapid restoration of railway traffic.
    The Railway Department formulates measures for collecting and protecting railway traffic equipment:
    I. Types of equipment to be collected:
    (1) Line materials: various rails, turnout switches, track spikes, fishplates, fishplate bolts, tie plates, line materials, etc.
    (2) Communication materials: copper wire, iron wire, porcelain insulators, telephones (dispatcher telephones), magneto telephones (wall-mounted, three to five units), portable telephones, carrier equipment, switchboards, telegraph machines, train order machines, wire tighteners, connectors.
    (3) Rolling stock materials: various parts of locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars, air pipes, heating pipes, axles, wheels, etc.
    (4) Signal lighting materials: railway-specific light bulbs, signal lights, colored glass, flags, signal machines, signal steel wire ropes, etc.
    (5) Water supply materials: boilers, water pumps, generators, water cranes, wrought iron pipes, cast iron pipes, electric rollers, water supply valves, and other parts originally used for water supply.
    (6) Engineering equipment: levels, transits, shovels, picks, crowbars, track jacks, small flatcars, flatcar bearings, axles, wheels, winches, steel wire ropes, spike hammers, rail benders, track rakes, pulleys, cranes.
    II. Collection Methods:
    (1) Conduct thorough political mobilization to make the people understand that destroying railways and hoarding equipment in the past was correct in order to eliminate the enemy; today's railways belong to our people, and we should voluntarily dedicate all railway traffic equipment.
    (2) Special municipalities and provincial and municipal governments should provide concrete leadership, especially county, district, and village governments should implement it earnestly, and cooperate with trade unions, farmers' associations, and citizen groups along the lines to mobilize the masses to dedicate equipment. Cadres must take the lead and dedicate first to motivate the masses.
    (3) Financial and economic leading organs in North China, Shandong, and Central Plains regions should mobilize public factories and enterprises that have collected railway equipment in the past but still retain a portion unused, to understand the serious difficulties in railway materials and hand over these materials to meet the needs of railway construction.
    (4) Temporary bridges built by highway bureaus, if constructed with steel rails, should be dismantled within a specified period and wooden bridges should be built instead. The dismantled steel rails should be inventoried and notified to the local railway bureau and engineering bureau for inspection and acceptance.
    (5) The railway bureau must first mobilize all employees to become models of collecting and dedicating equipment and play a backbone role, collecting and dedicating themselves and mobilizing the masses to dedicate equipment.
    (6) For lines already open to traffic, the railway administration sub-bureaus and offices should cooperate with the local government to establish a materials collection committee. Under the guidance of the government, the government should appoint a dedicated person (preferably the main person in charge of the administrative organ at all levels) as the chairman, and the responsible cadre of the railway bureau as the vice chairman, to mobilize and organize the masses and railway employees to collect and dedicate materials.
    (7) Railway stations and work zones should cooperate with the local district or village government to organize material collection stations. Under the guidance of the government, the district or village head should be the station head, and the railway section station master or foreman should be the deputy, responsible for directly collecting and receiving materials.
    (8) For railways not yet open to traffic, the railway bureau should dispatch material collection teams, under the leadership and assistance of the local government, to mobilize the masses and collect materials.
    (9) The expenses required for collection shall be paid by the railway bureau.
    A. For equipment voluntarily dedicated by the masses, a considerable amount will be rewarded according to the value of the equipment.
    B. For materials purchased and stored by the masses or organizations, if there is conclusive evidence, the original price will be reimbursed.
    C. Those who have made outstanding achievements in collecting and dedicating equipment will be given bonuses or honorary awards as appropriate. The amount of the bonus shall not exceed two-tenths of the value of the equipment, but the level of the award shall be determined according to the quality of the equipment. Honorary awards are divided into newspaper commendations, circular commendations, and medals, certificates, and award flags. Those who do not wish to receive bonuses may be given honorary awards.
    D. All collected materials shall be transported to the location designated by the railway bureau, which shall be responsible for transporting them away. If they are stored locally, the local government shall issue a receipt and be responsible for storage. All freight charges shall be paid by the railway bureau.
    E. Only transportation costs will be paid for rails stored in rural areas, and no bonuses will be given.
    (10) After receiving these measures, all organizations or individuals must register the stored equipment with the government or the railway bureau and its designated collection stations and collection teams, so that the railway bureau can find a way to transport them away to meet the urgent needs of railway construction.
    (11) All military, government, and civilian personnel have the responsibility to protect railway facilities in our area that have not yet been restored and must not damage them.
    (12) Personnel of material collection stations or collection teams and engineering teams must not take the opportunity to extort or blackmail, so as not to lose the government's prestige, and must not violate government laws and regulations. Violators will be punished according to law.
    III. After the issuance of these measures, the following types of railway-specific equipment are not allowed to be freely bought and sold on the market without the permission of the Military Commission Railway Department. Violators will have all their equipment confiscated and punished according to the seriousness of the circumstances, or sent to the court for punishment.
    Rails, track spikes, fishplate bolts, tie plates, turnouts, air pipes for braking, heating pipes for passenger cars, axles, wheels, light bulbs specifically for locomotives and passenger cars, copper and iron wires removed from railway poles, carrier equipment, dispatcher telephones.
    IV. From the date of issuance of these measures, it is prohibited to destroy or modify railway-specific equipment for other purposes, such as using track spikes to make sickles, fishplates to make guillotines, air pipes as shoe soles, iron wire to make nails, copper wire to refine copper, or dismantling machine parts for other purposes. Once such destructive behavior is discovered, in addition to confiscating all the equipment and turning it over to the public, it will also be sent to the court for punishment.
    It is strictly forbidden to continue to damage and steal railway equipment while collecting railway equipment.
    V. Those who damage and steal railway equipment and existing equipment will be punished according to the seriousness of the circumstances. Those who damage and steal railway equipment enough to cause major accidents, such as intentionally damaging and stealing track spikes, fishplates, fishplate bolts, turnouts, air pipes, signal machines, light bulbs, colored glass, placing stones or other obstacles on the rails, cutting electric wires, shooting at electric wires and porcelain bottles, stealing or damaging communication equipment, will be given the punishment they deserve according to the seriousness of the circumstances.
    VI. The investigation and reporting of those who hide railway equipment and deliberately refuse to dedicate it, and those who damage and steal railway equipment, is the common task of all military, government, civilian personnel, railway employees, militia, and self-defense forces. Governments at all levels must specifically grasp and lead this work. Those who have made contributions to reporting and investigating will be rewarded in accordance with the provisions of Item (9) of Article II.
