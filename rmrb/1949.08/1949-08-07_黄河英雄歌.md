    Song of the Yellow River Hero
    Wang Yaping
    On December 28, 1946, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits breached the dikes and released water, attempting to flood the people, villages, and fertile land of our liberated areas. For three years, millions of our people along the Yellow River, along with local armed forces, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, engaged in an earth-shattering struggle against Chiang Kai-shek and to defend the dikes. Every night, hundreds of miles of dikes along the Yellow River were lit with lanterns and torches as people rushed to repair and defend them. In this arduous and great struggle, many "model dike defenders" and "heroic rescuers" emerged, finally driving away Chiang Kai-shek's troops and overcoming the beastly Yellow River. Now, as the Yellow River is experiencing its peak flood season, I can't help but recall those heroic rescue stories. I have written the story of "Wang Hu Defending the Dike," titled "Song of the Yellow River Hero," to show how our liberated peasants selflessly risked their lives to rescue themselves and the interests of millions of others with their noble qualities:

     I
     The untamed Yellow River flows eastward,
     The untamed Yellow River is like a ferocious beast,
     The water level rose more than three feet overnight,
     Watching the dike about to break.
     The villages are dense, the population is thick,
     The common people are all worried:
     The sorghum drying on the dike,
     The millet below the dike is all full of weeds.
     The gongs are sounded from the back of the village to the front,
     Village cadres are shouting outside the doors:
     "Go to the dike! Go to the dike!
     Take lanterns and shovels!"
     Wang Hu instructed his young wife,
     To move Little Hu and their belongings onto the wooden boat:
     "In case the water breaks through the embankment,
     You can use this small boat."
     Torches and lanterns lit up the streets,
     The urgent gongs were sounded going up and down the dike,
     Wang Hu led his dike defense team,
     Carrying sorghum stalks, carrying hoes, carrying bundles of
     rope.
     "Hurry up! Don't dawdle!"
     Old Man Liu shouted at his nephew Niuwa,
     Men and women formed a rescue team,
     Heading towards the dike nervously.
     Hundreds and thousands of red lanterns,
     Brighter than the moon in the sky,
     The waves crashed against the dike wall,
     Trying to split and break the black dike.
     Like soldiers facing a great enemy,
     Like two armies about to engage in battle,
     The working people and the Yellow River,
     Engaged in a desperate struggle.
     The farmers spread out on the dike,
     Each person separated by a hundred steps or so,
     They watched the water anxiously,
     No one dared to close their eyes!
     In the past, the Kuomintang had a "River Management Committee,"
     Which only knew how to ask for money without repairing the dikes;
     Chiang Kai-shek's cowardice of bombing the dikes and releasing the Yellow River,
     Flooded people, villages, and fields.
     The Communist Party led the distribution of houses and land,
     Called on the people to oppose Chiang Kai-shek and repair the dikes,
     Eliminated the feudal landlord class,
     And also had to defeat the untamed Yellow River!

     II
     Young Wang Hu guarded the dike,
     Using a bamboo pole to measure the rise and fall of the water;
     Explaining to his partners the orders of the People's Government
     —
     Defend the golden dike, ensure the safety of the Yellow River!
     Wang Hu was like a soldier,
     Faithfully guarding his post,
     Sometimes checking the wave nests,
     Sometimes inspecting the dike wall.
     He was happy when the water receded,
     He was nervous when the water rose,
     Afraid of the night after guarding the day,
     Looking forward to dawn after guarding the night.
     He greeted the dike guards,
     To light the lanterns brightly,
     He told the dike guards,
     To be careful and vigilant!
     The partners happily sang:
     "Defend the Yellow River and have food and drink!
     Defend the Yellow River and fight Chiang Kai-shek!
     Defend the Yellow River and protect our home!"
     The Yellow River is like a face-changing wolf,
     Sometimes falling, sometimes rising,
     Seeing the moon leaning to the southwest,
     The water dropped a foot without wind or waves.
     As if passing a barrier,
     Wang Hu shouted to his partners:
     "Go home and rest!"
     Arranging for his partners to rest,
     He guarded a section of the dike himself;
     The Yellow River is like a ferocious beast,
     Crashing against the dike wall, wanting to escape.
     The Yellow River water, big waves rolling,
     Wang Hu's heart was uneasy.
     Looking east—the sky is not bright;
     Looking west—there are still a few red lanterns.
     He slowly walked down the dike,
     In front of the dike was his sorghum field,
     Remembering the hunger and suffering in the past,
     Now guarding the dike and farming for himself.
     The Yellow River hasn't breached in two years,
     Wheat yields one stone per mu,
     Sorghum one stone two, millet eight dou,
     Two years of harvest can match four years.
     He walked while thinking,
     The more he thought, the happier he became.
     Suddenly he saw a small hole under the dike,
     A stream of yellow water flowing outwards.
     (Wild rabbits! Wild foxes!
     Often burrow holes under the dike,
     The holes lead to the Yellow River water,
     The untamed Yellow River water surges outwards.)
     Wang Hu rushed forward,
     Without time to dig soil or shout,
     Using his arm to block the small hole,
     Not letting the Yellow River water surge outwards.
     The water force is great, the water force is fierce,
     Wang Hu desperately blocked the hole;
     He shouted—come and rescue!
     The dike guards—couldn't hear!
     Wang Hu rolled in the mud,
     His heart anxious, his eyes turning black,
     Die, but also block the Yellow River water!
     Die, but also not leave the dike!
     Wang Hu rolled in the mud,
     His heart anxious, his eyes turning black,
     Die, but also block the Yellow River water!
     Die, but also not leave the dike!
     Wang Hu rolled in the mud,
     His heart anxious, his eyes turning black,
     Die, but also block the Yellow River water!
     Die, but also not leave the dike!
     Like a mountain collapsing, like lightning striking,
     Suddenly half of the dike collapsed,
     Soil—crushed Wang Hu to death!
     Soil—blocked the breach!

     III
     The sun shines brightly in the east,
     The sun shines on Hugou Village,
     Little Hu's mother cooked breakfast,
     Standing happily in front of the street door.
     She looked at the avenue south of the village,
     This road leads directly to the riverbank,
     Wang Hu went down the dike from here every day,
     Why isn't he back today?
     Women are meticulous and suspicious:
     Could it be that he is still guarding the dike?
     Could it be that he went to check on the millet and sorghum?
     Could it be that he carelessly fell into the river?
     Little Hu's mother asked Old Man Liu:
     "Uncle Hu, have you seen him?
     The sun has passed half the wall,
     Why hasn't he come home for breakfast!"
     The old man was stunned,
     Turned his face and praised Wang Hu's bravery:
     He is truly solid and strong,
     Guarding the dike and preventing floods is all for the people.
     "The water has receded!" he said: "And there are no wind
     waves,"
     "Nothing dangerous will happen tonight,
     You all go back and rest,
     I will take responsibility for any problems!"
     They became more and more uneasy,
     Called a dozen young people,
     Together they found the place where the water was coming out,
     Everyone felt a chill in their hearts.
     The shovel opened the soil,
     A corpse was found in the mud,
     Wang Hu! Wang Hu ah!
     People shouted, shedding tears,
     Little Hu's mother's heart broke.
     Crying can't bring back the young loved one!
     Crying can't bring back the heroic dike defender!
     A memorial shed was built under the trees,
     People from all around gathered by the Yellow River.
     The district head and county head came to pay their respects in person,
     Bringing a white mourning couplet:
     Written on it "Yellow River Hero,"
     Wang Hu's reputation will spread throughout the world.
     The district head spoke to the tens of thousands of people,
     Praising the hero loudly:
     "We must oppose Chiang Kai-shek and defend the dike,
     And farm the land for the deceased's family!"
     The county head raised his arm high,
     Calling on the masses to learn from Wang Hu:
     "For the people, he forgot himself!
     For the rescue, he sacrificed himself!"
     "Eliminate the Chiang bandits! Defeat the Yellow River!"
     Cheers shook the heavens and the earth.
     The people erected a monument by the river,
     Commemorating the hero's deeds.
      August 2, 1949, Beijing.

    黄河英雄歌
    王亚平
    一九四六年十二月二十八日，蒋匪决堤放水，企图淹没我解放区人民、村庄、良田。三年来，我沿黄河几百万人民，地方武装，在共产党人民解放军领导下，进行了翻天覆地的反蒋守堤斗争，每到夜晚，几百里的临黄堤上都亮着灯笼、火把，抢险守堤。在这艰巨、伟大的斗争中，出现了不少“守堤模范”“抢险英雄”，终于赶走了蒋匪军，战胜了野兽似的黄水。如今正值黄河猛涨的大汛时期，不禁想起那些英勇抢险的故事，特写成“王虎守堤”的事迹，题为“黄河英雄歌”，以见我翻身农民如何在为自己以及千百万群众底利益舍身抢险的高尚品质：
     一  
     野性的黄水向东流，
     野性的黄河象猛兽，
     水头一夜涨了三尺多，
     眼望着大堤要决口。
     村庄密，人烟稠，
     老百姓都发了愁：
     上堤的高粱晒红米，
     下堤的谷子都莠齐。
     锣声打村后敲到村前，
     村干部在门外呼喊：
     “到堤上去吧！到堤上去吧！
     拿着灯火，拿着铁锨！”
     王虎嘱咐年青的妻，
     把小虎和家当搬上木船：
     “万一水头冲破了堤岸，
     你们就撑开这只小船。”
     火把、灯笼照亮了街筒，
     上堤下堤敲着紧急的锣声，
     王虎领着他的守堤小组
     背着秫秸、提着＠、扛着一捆
     麻绳。
     “快走！别他娘的磨蹭啦！”
     刘老殿骂他侄子牛娃，
     男男女女排成了抢险的队伍，
     紧张地朝着大堤进发。
     百盏千盏的红灯笼，
     比天上的月亮还明，
     水浪头冲打着堤墙，
     它要把黑色的长堤裂崩。
     好象战士临大敌，
     又似两军要交锋，
     劳动的人民和黄水，
     展开了决死的斗争。
     农民们在堤上散开，
     每个人隔着百十步远，
     他们提心吊胆看着水，
     谁也不敢合一合眼！
     从前国民党有“治河委员”，
     不修堤光知道要钱；
     蒋孬种炸堤放黄水，
     淹了人口、村庄和田园。
     共产党领着分房分地，
     号召人民反蒋修堤，
     消灭了封建地主阶级，
     还要战胜野性的黄水！
     二  
     年青的王虎守在堤上，
     用竹竿测量水的升降；
     给伙伴们讲说人民政府的命令
     ——
     固守金堤，确保临黄！
     王虎象一个战士，
     忠实地守着哨岗，
     一忽儿察看浪窝，
     一忽儿检查堤墙。
     水落了他心喜，
     水涨了他紧张，
     守过白天怕夜晚，
     守过黑夜盼天亮。
     他招呼守堤人，
     把灯笼点的明明亮，
     他嘱咐守堤人，
     认真小心地堤防！
     伙伴们高兴的唱歌：
     “守住黄水有吃喝！
     守住黄水打老蒋！
     守住黄水保家乡！”
     黄水象一个变脸狼，
     一时落了一时涨，
     眼看月亮偏西南，
     水落了一尺没风浪。
     仿佛闯过一道关，
     王虎喊着伙伴说：
     “你们回家去安眠！”
     安排伙伴去歇息，
     自己守住一段堤；
     黄水好似一猛兽，
     撞着堤墙要出走。
     黄河水，大浪翻，
     王虎的心里不得安。
     往东看——天不明；
     往西看——还有几只红灯笼。
     他慢慢地走下堤，
     堤前是他的高粱地，
     想起从前受饥受苦寒，
     如今守堤、种地为自己。
     黄河两年没决口，
     麦子一亩打一石，
     高粱一石二，谷子合八斗，
     两年要顶四年收。
     他一边想来一边走，
     心里越想越喜欢。
     忽然看到堤下一小洞，
     一道黄水向外翻。
     （野兔子！野狐狸！
     常在堤下打穴洞，
     穴洞通到黄河水，
     野性的黄水朝外涌。）
     王虎一步赶上前，
     来不及掘土和呼喊，
     用胳臂堵住小穴洞，
     不叫黄水向外冲。
     水力大，水力猛，
     王虎死力堵穴洞；
     他呼喊——快来抢险！
     守堤人——都听不见！
     王虎滚在泥水里，
     心里急，眼发黑，
     死，也要堵黄水！
     死，也不能离开堤！
     王虎滚在泥水里，
     心里急，眼发黑，
     死，也要堵黄水！
     死，也不能离开堤！
     王虎滚在泥水里，
     心里急，眼发黑，
     死，也要堵黄水！
     死，也不能离开堤！
     象山倒，象雷殛，
     忽然塌下半个堤，
     土——压死了王虎！
     土——堵住了决口！
     三  
     太阳在东边发亮光，
     太阳照着胡家庄，
     小虎娘做熟了早饭，
     快乐地站在街门前。
     她瞅着村南的大道，
     这条道直通到河边，
     王虎天天从这里下堤，
     为什么今天不见回转？
     妇女们心细多疑：
     莫非他还守在堤上？
     莫非他去看谷子高粱？
     莫非他不当心掉到河里？
     小虎娘找刘老殿问询：
     “虎儿爹，你可看见？
     太阳晒过半边墙，
     为啥还不回家吃饭！”
     老人打了一个楞怔，
     转了脸又夸王虎的英勇：
     他真是实心铁骨头，
     守堤防水一心为了群众。
     “水落了！”他说：“又没风
     浪，”
     “今夜不会出啥危险，
     你们都回去歇息，
     有问题我一人承担！”
     他们越说越不放心，
     招呼了十几个年青人，
     一齐找到出水的地方，
     大家心里打了一个寒呻。
     铁锨扒开了土呢，
     土泥里发现了一个尸体，
     王虎！王虎呵！
     人们呼叫着，淌着泪，
     小虎娘哭断了气。
     哭不活年青的亲人！
     哭不活守堤的英雄！
     树荫下搭起一个祭棚，
     黄河边聚集了四乡的群众。
     区长、县长亲来祭奠，
     带着一幅白色挽联：
     上写着“黄河英雄”，
     王虎的名声天下流传。
     区长对着上万的群众，
     大声地表扬英雄：
     “我们要反蒋守堤，
     替死者的家属代耕！”
     县长高举起手臂，
     号召群众向王虎学习：
     “为群众他忘了个人！
     为抢险他牺牲了自己！”
     “消灭蒋匪！战胜黄水！”
     欢呼震动了天地。
     群众在河边立了一个碑文，
     纪念着英雄的事迹。
      一九四九、八月二日、北平。
