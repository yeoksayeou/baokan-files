　　The Vatican's Profit-Grabbing
　　By Gao Erjin, translated by Hua Ming

　　"Lend, but expect no gain," – this is how Catholic priests admonish their followers. But although they solemnly condemn love of money and preach the gospel of poverty, the Catholic theocracy, as proven by its own thousand-year history, is very fond of worldly wealth. As Catholic bishops act without disguise as international money-grabbers and profit-seekers, and as the Vatican increasingly becomes an element of general monopoly capital organizations, the hypocrisy of the "church fathers" has never been as blatant as it is today, never as terrifying as it is today.

　　Like every capitalist company, the Vatican Company also has its own tycoons. It is interesting that many of them are neither related to the priestly profession nor to general religion. They are clearly secular figures, specialized business manipulators, either employed by the Vatican Company or running the Vatican Company, just as they might run the Chicago Packing Company or the Malayan Colonial Company. Some of them wear cassocks for appearances' sake, but the vast majority do not bother with such disguises.

　　The Vatican's direct confidants include several dozen titled international profit-grabbers, who certainly have nothing sacred in their business or private lives. Count Paolo Blumenstihl, Prince Aldo Brandini, Marquis Sacchetti, Prince Alvaro de Orleans-Borbon, Engineers Gariaggi and Guardi, Professor Guarneli – these Vatican dignitaries are the capitalist pillars of the Roman papal court. Their names can be found everywhere in various combinations in the annual reports of Italian monopoly companies.

　　This gang of accomplices extends into every pore of the Italian economic organism. One of the most prominent figures among them is Bernardino Nogara, the Pope's financial advisor. One only needs to flip through any Italian business directory to discover that this papal favorite, though not as omnipresent as God, is truly ubiquitous. Nogara is the general manager of the General Real Estate, Municipal, and Agricultural Development Company, which is mostly run by Jesuits; he is also the general manager of the large housing ownership and municipal construction trust, known as the West Rome Company; and he is also the general manager of the mortgage bank.

　　In addition, he sits on the boards of directors of many large capitalist companies, such as: Rome Real Estate Company – one of the largest companies buying and selling real estate; Pantanella Mining and Macaroni Trust, the oldest trust in Italy; South Italian Railway Company; Montecatini Chemical Company; Electrical Engineering and Electrochemical Company; Cartiere Burgo paper and Tevito Trust, whose interests are closely linked to those of the electricity monopoly; Adriatic Electric Company, which not only controls the electricity supply of the entire country and important parts of the former colonies (Libya and the Dodecanese), but also controls the water supply, arms manufacturing, travel business, and the production of machine tools and rail equipment.

　　Space does not permit us to list here all the Italian capitalist companies in which Nogara participates in one capacity or another for the benefit of the Vatican; but two more companies in which he participates must be mentioned. He is the Deputy General Manager of the Italian Commercial Bank and (a point particularly worth noting) a director of the Monte Carlo Casino Company; it has been proven that a considerable number of shares in this international gambling den are held for the Roman Papal Court.

　　In the gambling section of the General Real Estate Company (as mentioned above, Nogara is its general manager), sit Italian feudal financial aristocratic figures such as Massorio Basseri, Marquis Sacchetti, and the two engineers mentioned above, Guardi and Gariaggi.

　　Marcantonio Basseri is the nephew of Pope Pius XII. He is the general manager of the Pantanella Mining and Macaroni Trust, of which Nogara is a director. He also holds positions in many other joint-stock companies, such as: Italian Charcoal Company, Frascati Nuova Construction Company, Southeast Italian Railway Company. On the other hand, in the General Real Estate Company, with Nogara as general manager, this papal nephew is only a director.

　　Among the important figures through whom the Vatican occupies an important economic position in Italy, the position of Engineer Guardi is also considerable. No one knows what kind of engineer he is. But as an open or secret guardian of the Vatican's monopolistic interests, Guardi is active enough. He is the chairman of Nogara's General Real Estate Company and also a director of Basseri's Pantanella Mining and Macaroni Trust. In his own company, he is the all-powerful manager of the Rome Food Company and also a director of the Frascati Nuova Construction Company.

　　Another engineer, Gariaggi, is the chairman of the Vatican's own technical department. In addition, he occupies the position of general manager of the Central Italian Company, which handles real estate transactions and construction contracts, and is also a director of Acqua Pia and Rome Electric Company.

　　A typical representative of a feudal aristocrat in the Vatican's commercial constellation is Marquis Sacchetti, a great landowner with more than 25,000 hectares of land in the Lazio province alone. This marquis is the "steward" of all the papal palaces and also the steward of the real estate occupied by the secret order "Caba i Spada". In addition, he also serves as the president of the St. Peter's Association and the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church. Finally, Sacchetti is the general manager of the notorious Vatican Holy Spirit Bank and a director of the water company.

　　In today's Italy, there is hardly an important industrial or financial enterprise in which the Vatican does not directly or indirectly meddle. In the national economic life, it holds large amounts of stock in many very important industrial, agricultural, and banking companies. In other companies, it can also exert influence through its direct agents or indirect important figures among its key employees, or through people who are connected with the Vatican in terms of business, family relations, or class interests.

　　However, in one economic area the Vatican possesses a real monopoly, and that is the construction industry and suburban real estate. Real estate speculation is one of the main commercial activities manipulated by the Vatican. Through the General Real Estate Company (Nogara) and many other companies that directly depend on the Vatican, the Church controls many types of land, houses, and construction companies in Genoa, Milan, Pisa, Naples, and other Italian cities. Land and buildings of great value are owned by the Rome Real Estate Company, religious orders, and monasteries.

　　Another economic area that the Vatican is busy drilling into is the electrical industry and power resources. A typical example of how the Vatican is carrying out its monopoly plan is the activities of the Central Joint-Stock Company.

　　The main purpose of this company, as stated in its charter, is to fund electrical engineering and telephone design. The company was founded in Legnano in 1925 with a capital of one million lire. In 1947, it obtained a net profit of more than 80 million lire. Most of the obtained shares are distributed among companies that are connected to the Vatican in one way or another. These companies are the Rome Bank, the Italian Commercial Bank, the Holy Spirit Bank, the Italian Trust Bank, the South Italian Railway Company, the General Insurance Company, and the Electrical Engineering and Electrochemical Company.

　　The example of the Central Company can also reveal the interaction between Vatican capital and the international financial community. This powerful company also has foreign shareholders, including the American-managed Italian Supreme Electric Company, the Swiss Industrial Electric Company, the San Marino Savings Bank, and the Swedish Ericsson Company.

　　The Vatican's businessmen try to hide their real shares in these large capitalist companies. In the Central Company, it is officially said to hold only 0.37 percent of the shares. But this is an accountant's trick, because in each of the Central Company's twenty Italian subsidiaries, control is in the hands of the Vatican, and therefore those who have full say in these companies are the Vatican dignitaries. In the board of directors of the Electrical Engineering and Electrochemical Company, Nogara controls everything. In the management of the Adriatic Electric Company, Paolo Blumenstihl is as famous as Nogara. In the board of directors of the Rome Electric Company, there is a whole string of Vatican people; Prince Aldo Brandini, the general manager of the company, is one of them; Vittorio Serutti, Gariaggi and Baglia directors are also.

　　Through the Central Company and some other large trusts (such as Edison Company, South Italian Electric Company, Sicilian Electric Company), the Vatican has extended its power not only to the electrical engineering industry but also to the electricity production industry. In this industry, in addition to Nogara and others who have already been mentioned above, we also see the names of Volpi, Goggia, and Crespi's descendants.

　　The Vatican's interests also extend to the railways of Italy. Pope's nephew Basseri is the general manager of the Southeast Italian Railway. In the board of directors of the South Italian Railway Company, sitting side by side with the ubiquitous Nogara is Trivus, who is also Nogara's agent in the management of the General Real Estate Company. There is also Professor Guarneli, the head of the Rome Real Estate Company.

　　Another industry that has become the target of special attention from the Vatican is the chemical industry. Nogara, together with one of his closest deputies, Dandolo, is the link between the Roman Papal Court and the huge Italian Montecatini Chemical Trust. Through Adasso, a director of the Catholic Action newspaper Il Corditiano, the Vatican has a strong connection with another large chemical trust, SNIA Viscosa. Through Duke Sera di Cassano and Prince Alvaro de Orleans-Borbon, it controls the famous Bombrini Parodi Delfino industrial financial group, which owns or funds dozens of factories producing gunpowder, explosives, fertilizers, acids, and gas.

　　Standing above the Yanning Chemical Company is the Vatican's spy, Battistelli. The Chemical Products Company is run by Adasso (whom we have already mentioned) and Moroso della Rocca. Prince Basseri is the general manager of the Italian Charcoal Company. The Tar Production Finance Company is managed by Marquis Sacchetti. With the help of the Barisi financial group, the Vatican virtually monopolizes sulfur production, one of Italy's main raw materials.

　　The Vatican's people are also the masters of Italgas, Italy's main gas company; Basseri is its deputy general manager.

　　Here, it is necessary to talk specifically about the role played by the Vatican in the banking industry. The Vatican's main financial credit institutions are the Rome Bank, the Holy Spirit Bank, and the Scaletti and Ugo Natali Bank. Basseri, Montini (the cardinal's brother), and Adasso are the actual masters of the RoLo Bank. Nogara, the real mastermind who links the "church princes" and the god of wealth, is the Deputy General Manager of the Italian Commercial Bank. Italy has a vast banking system, and the Vatican's power extends to dozens of special local banks, especially the Vatican's control of a series of land credit banks, central credit banks, municipal development banks, and many other banks. In addition, there are 150 small agricultural banks and so-called "people's" banks scattered throughout the country. They are all suction pipes, and the millions of lire earned by the hard work of the Italian people flow along these suction pipes into the treasury of the Roman Papal Court.

　　This record is very incomplete. Although there is not much material, it is enough to dispel the illusion that "the Church is opposed to the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few supreme dignitaries," as the Pope asserted in his recent document to Catholic Action organizations. The fact is that the Vatican itself belongs to this group of "supreme dignitaries," it represents the monopoly capitalist class, clearly for excess profits. This explains why the Catholic Church is a deadly enemy of communism and why they want to defend the privileges of the rich and imperialist swindlers.

　　攫取利润的梵蒂岗
    高尔金作  华明译
    “放帐，但不要期望得利，”——天主教的神父们这样训诚他们的信徒们。但是，虽然他们神气十足地斥责爱财与宣讲贫穷的福音，而天主教的神权政治，即由其本身一千多年的历史，证明他们是非常喜欢世俗财富的。当天主教的主教们毫无掩饰地以国际抓钱者与攫取利润者的面目去行动，与梵蒂岗日益变成一般独占资本组织的要素时，“教会神父们”的伪善，却从来没有象在我们今天这样地嚣嚣然，以前这种伪善从来未象在我们今天这样达到可怕的程度。
    象每个资本家公司一样，梵蒂岗公司也有它自己的大亨。很有意思的是，他们之中有许多人，既与牧师职业无关，亦与一般宗教无关。他们显然都是些世俗人物，专门的商业操纵者，他们或者是为梵蒂岗公司所雇佣的，或者就是经营梵蒂岗公司的，极象他们可以经营芝加哥包装公司，也可以经营马来亚殖民地公司一样。他们之中有些人，为了外表原故，穿着袈裟，但他们最大多数都不愿麻烦从事于这种伪装。
    梵蒂岗的直接亲信，包括着好几打有头衔的国际利润攫取者，他们无论在其业务中，或在其私生活中，都确实没有什么神圣之可言。巴阿洛·布鲁门斯提尔伯爵，阿多布朗狄尼亲王，萨开提侯爵，阿尔发洛·得·奥尔良·巴尔奔亲王，加里阿吉与瓜尔狄工程师，瓜内利教授——这些梵蒂岗的显贵们，都是罗马教王宫廷的资本家台柱。他们的名字，在意大利独占公司年报中的各种各样的组合中到处可以看到。
    这一伙党徒伸入到意大利经济机体的每个毛孔中，其中一个最显赫的人物是柏那狄诺·诺加拉，他是教皇的财政顾问。人们只要翻一翻任何意大利商业人名录，就可发现这位教皇宠臣，虽然不是象神之无所不在，却也真是无所不在。诺加拉是总地产、市政、农业发展公司的总经理，该公司大都是耶苏会的人经营的；他又是大房屋占有与市政建设托拉斯，即人人所知的西罗马公司的总经理；也是抵押银行的总经理。
    此外，他还坐在许多大资本家公司的董事部，例如：罗马地产公司—买卖地产的最大公司之一；班泰尼拉采矿与马卡洛尼托拉斯，意大利最老的托拉斯；南意大利铁路公司；蒙泰卡提尼化学公司；电气工程与电气化学公司；卡提尔·布尔哥造纸与铁维托拉斯，该托拉斯的利益是与电力独占公司的利益密切结合着的；阿德里亚电业公司，该公司不仅控制着全国和前殖民地（里比亚与多狄坎尼斯）重要部分的电力供给，而且也控制着水的供给，军火制造，旅行商业，以及机器工具与铁轨器材的生产。
    篇幅不许我们在这里把诺加拉为梵蒂岗牟利而以这种或那种资格参加的一切意大利资本家公司的名字，一一列举出来；但是对他所参加的公司，还有两个必须提出来。他是意大利商业银行的副总经理，而且（特别值得注意的一点）是蒙泰·卡洛·卡西诺公司的董事；事实证明：在这个国际赌窟中，数量可观的股份，是为罗马教皇宫廷所持有。
    在总产地产公司（如上所述，诺加拉是它的总经理）赌窟事部中，还坐着意大利封建金融贵族人物，如马索里奥·巴塞里，萨开提侯爵，以及上边所说过的两位工程师，瓜尔狄与加里阿吉。
    马坎托尼奥·巴塞里是教皇比护第十二的侄儿。他是班泰尼拉采矿与马卡洛尼托拉斯的总经理，诺加拉则是该托拉斯的董事。他也兼领着许多其他股份公司，例如：意大利木炭公司，福拉斯卡提·奴奥瓦建筑公司，东南意大利铁路公司。另一方面，在以诺加拉任总经理的总地产公司中，这位教皇侄儿则只是一个董事。
    在梵蒂岗之窃踞意大利重要经济地位的重要人物中，工程师瓜尔狄的地位也是相当可观的。他是怎样一种工程师，没有一个人知道。但是，当作梵蒂岗独占利益之公开或秘密的监护人，则瓜尔狄是够活跃的。他是诺加拉的总地产公司的董事长，兼任巴塞里的班泰尼拉采矿与马卡洛尼托拉斯的董事。在他自己公司中，他则是罗马食物公司之大权独揽的经理，兼任福拉斯卡提·奴奥瓦建筑公司的理事。
    另一位工程师加里阿吉，是梵蒂岗本身技术部的董事长。此外，他又占着中央意大利公司总经理的地位，该公司是处理地产交易与建筑合同的，还兼任阿克垮·比亚与罗马电业公司的董事。
    在梵蒂岗商业星座中一位封建贵族的典型代表，是萨开提侯爵，这是一位土地大王，单在拉吉奥省，就有土地二万五千海克特尔以上。这位侯爵是所有教皇各宫的“总管”，也是为“卡巴·伊·斯巴大”秘密命令所占有的地产的总管。此外，他还兼任圣彼得会与耶稣Ｓ·库奥尔·狄·盖苏圣公会的会长。最后，萨开提是恶名昭著的梵蒂岗圣灵银行的总经理与自来水公司的董事。
    今天的意大利，几乎没有一个重要工业或金融企业，梵蒂岗不在其中直接间接染指的。在国家经济生活中，很多非常重要的工业、农业、银行业的公司中，它都握有庞大数量的股票。在其他公司中，它也能够经过其直接代理人或重要职员中的间接重要人物，或者经过在业务上、家族关系上、阶级利害上与梵蒂岗有联系的人们，而对之施以影响。
    然而，在一个经济园地中梵蒂岗占有真实垄断权的，那就是建筑工业与城郊地产。地产投机是梵蒂岗操纵商业的主要活动之一。经过总地产公司（诺加拉）与许多其他直接依赖梵蒂岗的一些公司，教会就控制了热那亚、米兰、比萨、那不勒斯以及其他意大利城市中许多种类的土地、房屋、与建筑公司。有巨大价值的土地与建筑物，都是属于罗马地产公司、宗教团体与修道院所有。
    另一经济园地梵蒂岗正忙于钻营的，是电气工业与动力资源。梵蒂岗如何去进行其垄断计划的典型例子，就是中央股份公司的活动。
    这个公司的主要目的，如在其特许状中所载明的，是资助电气工程与电话设计。该公司是一九二五年成立于勒格浑，资本为一百万里尔，一九四七年，获得纯利润在八千万里尔以上。获的股份大都分配在以这样那样的方法与梵蒂岗有联系的各公司中。这些公司就是罗马银行，意大利商业银行，圣灵银行，意大利信托银行，南意大利铁路公司，普通保险公司，电气工程与电气化学公司。
    中央公司的例子也可揭露梵蒂岗资本与国际金融界的相互作用。这个强大公司也有外国股东，其中有美管意大利最高电力公司，瑞士工业电力公司，圣马里诺储蓄银行，瑞典伊里克逊公司。
    梵蒂岗的商人们企图隐蔽他们在这一类大资本家公司中的真实股份。在中央公司中，据官方说，只保有股份的百分之○·三七。但这是一个会计员的诡计，因为在中央公司的二十个意大利子公司的每一个公司，控制权都是为梵蒂岗所掌握，因此，在这些公司中有全部发言权者，是梵蒂岗的显贵们。在电气工程与电气化学公司的董事部中，操纵一切的是诺加拉。在阿德里亚电业公司的经理部中，与诺加拉齐名的，还有巴阿洛·布鲁门斯提尔。在罗马电业公司的董事部中，有一整串梵蒂岗的人；阿多布朗提尼亲王，公司的总经理，就是一个；维托利阿·塞鲁蒂，加里阿吉与巴利亚董事们也都是。
    经过中央公司与一些其他大托拉斯（例如爱迪孙公司，南意大利电业公司，西西里电业公司），梵蒂岗就把它的势力不仅扩展到电气工程工业，而且也伸展到电力生产工业。在这一工业中，除了上边所已说过的诺加拉以及其他人外，我们还看到佛尔匹，哥吉亚与克勒斯辟后裔这些人的名字。
    梵蒂岗的利益也伸张到意大利的铁路中，教皇的侄儿巴塞利，是东南意大利铁路的总经理。在南意大利铁路公司的董事部中，与无所不在的诺加拉并肩而坐的，是特利夫斯，他也是诺加拉之在总地产公司经理部中的代理人。还有瓜内利教授，他是罗马地产公司的首脑。
    其他工业成为梵蒂岗特别注意的目标的是化学工业。诺加拉，同他的一个最亲密的副手丹多罗，是罗马教皇宫廷与巨大的意大利蒙泰卡提尼化学托拉斯之间的链环。经过天主教行动报伊尔·科提狄亚诺的董事阿达索，梵蒂岗即与另一大化学托拉斯，斯尼亚·维斯考萨有了强固的联系。经过塞拉·狄·卡萨诺公爵与阿发洛·得·奥尔良·波尔奔亲王，它就控制了著名的邦布利尼·巴洛狄·得尔菲诺工业金融集团，该集团占有或资助了几十个生产火药、炸药、肥料、酸类、煤气类的制造厂。
    在亚宁化学公司之上站立着梵蒂岗的间谍巴提斯特里。化学产品公司是由阿达索（这个人我们已经讲过）与摩洛佐·得拉·洛卡经营的。意大利木炭公司的总经理是巴塞里亲王。焦油出产金融公司是萨开提侯爵经理的。借着巴里西金融集团的帮助，梵蒂岗实际地独占了硫磺生产，这是意大利的主要原料之一。
    梵蒂岗的人也是意大利主要煤气公司伊塔尔加斯的主人；巴塞里是它的副总经理。
    这里要特别讲讲梵蒂岗在银行业中所起的作用。梵蒂岗的主要金融信贷机关，是罗马银行，圣灵银行，斯卡勒提与乌哥·那塔里银行。巴塞里，蒙提尼（红衣主教的兄弟）与阿达索，是罗罗银行的实际的主事者。诺加拉，那位联系“教会亲王”与财神的真实的主谋定计者，是意大利商业银行的副总经理。意大利有一个广大的银行业系统，而梵蒂岗的势力则扩展到几十个特别地方银行，尤其是梵蒂岗掌握了一连串土地信贷银行，中央信贷银行，市政发展银行，以及其他许多银行。除此以外，还要加上散布在全国各地的一百五十个小的农业银行及所谓“人民”银行。它们都是些吸血管，千百万意大利人民辛苦所得的里尔，都顺着这些吸血管流进罗马教皇宫廷的金库。
    这个记载很不完全。虽然材料不多，但已足够祛除那种幻想，以为“教会是反对把财富积累在少数最高权贵之手”，如教皇在其最近致天主教行动组织的文书中所断言的。事实是，梵蒂岗本身就是属于这个“最高权贵”集团，它代表独占资本界，显然是为了超额利润。这就解释明白了为什么天主教教会是共产主义之死敌，而且他们要保卫富翁及帝国主义骗子们的特权。
