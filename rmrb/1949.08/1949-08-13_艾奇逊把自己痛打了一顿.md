Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 12th: TASS, Moscow, 11th: The "Pravda" published an article by Saslavsky entitled "Mr. Acheson Gave Himself a Beating," commenting on the recent "White Paper" on Sino-American relations published by the U.S. State Department, stating:

	It is said that even a rabbit, if beaten long enough, can learn to strike a match. It turns out that some American diplomats, unlike rabbits, have not learned anything after being beaten for a long time. The recent "White Paper" published by the U.S. State Department, entitled "United States Relations with China," irrefutably proves this point.

	In all 1,054 pages, the State Department did nothing but publish documents about the failure of American policy in China, thereby beating itself. In addition to these 1,054 pages of the complete "White Paper," Secretary of State Acheson added seven pages in his own style. The gist of these things is: We have made one mistake after another, and we will continue to make mistakes in the future.

	Acheson wrote about the Kuomintang leaders: "Many observers believed that they (referring to the Kuomintang) engaged in bribery, power struggles, and relied on the United States to win battles for them, so that they could maintain their power and position in China."

	Thus, Acheson described the Chinese Kuomintang as a thoroughly corrupt and profit-seeking degenerate group. Everyone knows that the Chinese people discovered this much earlier than the American diplomats.

	Acheson described the internal workings of the U.S. State Department this way: "Three possibilities were before the United States: First, to withdraw all troops from China; Second, to intervene militarily on a large scale to support the Kuomintang and eliminate the Communists; Third, to help the Kuomintang maintain control over as large a piece of Chinese territory as possible, and to try to end the civil war by means of compromise between the two parties." All three possibilities had their roots in the minds of American thinkers in the State Department. Among these possibilities, the possibility of non-interference in Chinese affairs has proven impossible! Acheson was unwilling to voluntarily withdraw American troops from China. He was full of hope to send new troops there—many more troops than before—to support those Kuomintang members whom he described as bribers and adventurers. But this proved to be beyond America's power, despite the support already given to a regime that Acheson himself confessed was unable to continue in China.

	The ruthless logic of real life defeated Acheson's arsenal of illogic. Acheson's third and second possibilities were finished. What was realized was precisely the first possibility. American troops, along with Kuomintang troops, left Peiping, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other cities.

	The Chinese Kuomintang suffered a shameful defeat, and the U.S. State Department's policy shared in this disgrace. Chiang Kai-shek wasted billions of dollars on this obviously hopeless cause.

	But it cannot be said that these billions of dollars were completely wasted. Acheson wrote with a pain concealing unconscious irony: "Due to the lack of military genius of the government leaders, due to their mistakes and surrenders, and due to the low morale of the troops, most of the weapons that the United States gave to Chiang Kai-shek have been seized by the People's Liberation Army." Acheson ruthlessly beat Chiang Kai-shek. Lack of genius! Mistakes! Surrender! But every blow hit Acheson himself. Utterly unlucky American policy towards China! Mistake after mistake! Stupidity after stupidity! But in what way was Chiang Kai-shek inferior to his American partners? They held the same view of the Chinese people. They regarded the Chinese people as worthless people who could not be rational and must obey foreign rulers.

	After whipping himself and straightening out his disheveled clothes, Acheson bravely shouted: We will continue to follow the same policy in the future.

	In order to defend their inglorious policy before the gullible American readers, Acheson attempted to shift all responsibility to… the Soviet Union. Acheson thought that the Chinese people could not see through the faces of the Kuomintang rulers with their own eyes. Acheson attributed the complete failure of the Kuomintang to "foreign—Russian—influence, which, in the past fifty years, under Tsarist rule and under Communist rule, has consistently attempted to extend its control in the Far East."

	The unparalleled stupidity of these words, like a pile of rubble during a volcanic eruption, is astonishing. Logic is absolutely different from Mr. Acheson's mental volcano. He overturned the entire history at once. The volcanic eruption from Acheson's mouth has turned history upside down. It is well known that in China, the American policy and the Tsarist policy were completely in accord, because the American and Tsarist diplomats were united in supporting the Chinese reactionaries.

	We cannot call Acheson's revelations historical or political errors, because they are malicious distortions of facts. From these revelations, it can be seen that the American politicians have learned nothing. The lessons learned by an ordinary rabbit after being beaten will be more beneficial than those learned from this shameful failure. Acheson said that he will continue to support the Chinese reactionaries in the future. This means that new failures in China are waiting for the American imperialists. Well, a person is free to choose! Let the U.S. State Department prepare another white paper on the disastrous defeat of American policy in China in advance!

### 艾奇逊把自己痛打了一顿

    艾奇逊把自己痛打了一顿
    萨斯拉夫斯基
    【新华社北平十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科十一日电，真理报发表萨斯拉夫斯基所撰论文，题为“艾奇逊先生把自己痛打了一顿”，评论美国国务院最近所发表的关于中美关系的“白皮书”，内称：
    听说，甚至一只兔子挨打挨得久了，也可以学会点火柴的。事实证明：有些美国外交家，和兔子不同，挨打很久却没有学会任何东西，美国国务院最近发表的题为“美国与中国的关系”的长篇累牍的“白皮书”，无可反驳地证明了这一点。
    在全部一千零五十四页中间，国务院除了发表关于美国在华政策失败的文件而自己打自己以外，什么也没有作。在这一千零五十四页完整的“白皮书”之外，国务卿艾奇逊又用自己的风格增加了七页。这些东西的要点就是：我们曾经一个接连一个地犯错误，而且今后我们将继续犯错误。
    艾奇逊在谈到国民党领袖时写道：许多观察家认为，他们（按指国民党）从事于受贿、争权夺位和依赖美国给他们打胜仗，而他们就可以保持在中国的权力和地位。
    这样，艾奇逊就把中国国民党描述为澈头澈尾地腐朽了的唯利是图的腐化集团。大家知道，中国人民发现这一点比美国的外交家们早得多。
    艾奇逊又是这样描述美国国务院的内部工作的：“在美国面前有三个可能性：一、把军队全部撤出中国；二、大规模军事干涉以支援国民党，消灭共产党；三、帮助国民党保持对于尽可能大块的中国领土的控制权，并用使两党妥协的办法来试图结束内战”。三个可能性都在国务院的美国思想家的头脑里有其根源。在这些可能性中间，不干涉中国事务的可能性，已经证明了是不可能的！艾奇逊不愿自动把美国军队撤出中国。他满心希望派遣新的军队到那里去——比以前多得多的军队，去支持那些被他形容为受贿者与冒险家的国民党人，但这证明是美国力所不及的，尽管已经对艾奇逊自供为无法在中国继续下去的政权给予支持，还是行不通。
    现实生活的无情逻辑打败了没有逻辑的艾奇逊兵工厂。艾奇逊的第三个和第二个可能性完蛋了。实现了的恰恰是第一个可能性。美国军队跟国民党军队一起离开了北平、南京、上海和其它城市。
    中国国民党遭受了可耻的失败，美国国务院的政策也分享了这个耻辱。蒋介石浪费了几十亿美元来作这个显然没有希望的事。
    但是不能说这几十亿美元是完全浪费掉了。艾奇逊怀着掩藏着不自觉的讽刺的痛苦写道：由于政府领袖缺乏军事天才，由于他们的错误和投降以及由于部队士气的低沉，美国交给蒋介石的大部分武器已被人民解放军所缴获。艾奇逊毫不留情地把蒋介石打了一顿。缺乏天才！错误！投降！但是每一下都打中了艾奇逊自己。倒霉透顶的美国对华政策！错误之后又是错误！愚蠢之后又有愚蠢！但是蒋介石什么地方不如他的美国伙伴呢？他们对于中国人民抱着同一的看法，他们把中国人民看作自己不能有理性和必须服从外国统治者的贱民。
    在自己鞭打了自己和把他的弄乱了的衣服拉整齐之后，艾奇逊勇敢地叫道：今后我们仍将遵循同样的方针。
    为了在轻信的美国读者面前替他们的不光荣的政策作辩护，艾奇逊企图把全部责任推给……苏联。艾奇逊以为，中国人民不能用自己的眼睛看穿国民党统治者的面目。艾奇逊把国民党的完全失败说成是由于“外国——俄国——的影响，它在过去五十年中，在沙皇统治下以及在共产党统治下，一贯地企图扩展它在远东的控制权”。
    这些话的无比愚蠢，象火山爆发时的一堆乱石头一样，使人们大吃一惊。逻辑是与艾奇逊先生的精神火山绝对不同。他一下子就把整个历史推翻了。艾奇逊的嘴巴上的火山爆发，把历史颠倒过来了。人所共知，在中国，美国的政策与沙皇的政策完全是情投意合的，因为美国与沙皇的外交家们在支持中国反动派一点上是一致的。
    我们不能把艾奇逊吐露的话叫作历史的或政治的错误，因为它们是恶毒的歪曲事实。从这些透露的话当中可以看出：美国的政客们什么也没有学到。一只普通的兔子在挨了一顿饱打之后所得到的教训，会比从这种可耻的失败中所得到的较为有益。艾奇逊说，今后他还要支持中国反动派。这意味着在中国新的失败又在等着美国帝国主义者。好罢，一个人是有选择的自由的！让美国国务院事先准备好关于美国在华政策的惨败的另一个白皮书吧！
