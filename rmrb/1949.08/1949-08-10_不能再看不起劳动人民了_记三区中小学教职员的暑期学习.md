“We Can No Longer Look Down on the Working People”
Record of the Summer Study of Teachers and Staff in the Third District's Primary and Secondary Schools
Zhang Fu
The Third District Center Branch of the Summer Study Conference for Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff, with over six hundred teachers and staff members, has maintained high morale since the start of the study. During the learning process, there have been biases and detours, but also initial achievements.

There are many vivid facts that prove the high morale for learning. For example, Mr. Cui, because he has to take care of school work during the day, cannot fully participate in collective learning, so he came up with a way: he puts the alarm clock on the bedside table, and after sleeping for a few hours at night, when he hears the alarm, he gets up to read. Mr. Wu, who gave birth to a child only half a month ago, also came to participate in the study. There is also a sixty-year-old gentleman who cannot sit because of hemorrhoids, so he stands to participate in the study discussion. A couple in Group Fifteen have a child who is only eight months old, and in order to study and make progress eagerly, they leave their beloved child at home and entrust him to his sister-in-law to take care of. The woman gets up every day before dawn to cook, and she is also very active in learning, and her notes and outlines are all done meticulously. The formation of this learning enthusiasm is because everyone realizes that "learning is their own business," and only through learning can they make progress.

"Twenty Years of Confused Views, Swept Away Today!"

In the short learning process, everyone has gained a lot in terms of ideological understanding and action (especially after learning the labor viewpoint). For example, Mr. Gao summarized his learning and said: "The old and vague views accumulated in my mind for more than 20 years, such as 'heroes create the times' and 'history is created by emperors, kings, and generals,' are now swept away." Mr. Shen also said: "After learning that labor creates the world, my attitude towards the working masses has changed from looking down on them to valuing them from the bottom of my heart, and from valuing them to respecting them. Now, ideologically, I simply admire the laboring masses, and at the same time, I am deeply condemned by the inner pain for my past contempt for labor." Mr. Zhang said: "I no longer put on the airs of intellectuals, and I can no longer look down on the working people. A few days ago, I unprecedentedly used a cart to fetch water on the street. Sister-in-law Li Si from the neighborhood saw me and said in surprise: 'Mr., why are you fetching water?'"

The Correct Path of Learning is Found from Detours

More than six hundred teachers and staff members have been bound by old habits for a long time in the past. From individual learning to collective learning, from simple book learning to obtaining new learning methods that combine theory with practice, they have taken winding roads. First of all, there was dogmatic learning. At the beginning, some groups wanted to define what is labor? What are the productive forces and production relations? After discussing for two days, the definition had not yet been discussed, and a week had passed, and their thoughts were still "untouched"! Everyone felt that this dogmatic learning method was problematic, and then they switched to the correct learning method that combined with practice and with their own thoughts. Everyone asked for criticism and self-criticism, but how to do it? Before starting, first talk about why criticism and self-criticism are necessary? Why do this? What are the benefits! A series of ideological problems were solved in the chat, and as a result, everyone was very excited. The group leader asked: "Are you ready?" Fifteen mouths almost scrambled to say: "I'm ready, criticize me." "I have many shortcomings, criticize me quickly," but the group leader said again: "All problems must be addressed through your own thoughts, mainly through self-criticism," so everyone was stunned again, and then slowly criticized from life to thought and action, and the criticism gradually unfolded. Some groups didn't talk much for the first few days. The reason was that everyone was polite and unaccustomed to it. Later, after personal introductions and mutual help from the group, everyone became familiar with each other, and they talked more. For example, Mr. Wang did not dare to speak at school, and asked others to read the outlines he wrote, but now he can actively speak. The correct path of learning is slowly found in the old thoughts, habits, and styles of the past after detours and twists and turns!

    “不能再看不起劳动人民了”
    记三区中小学教职员的暑期学习
    张夫
    中小学教职员暑期学习会三区中心分会，六百多位教职员，自学习以来，情绪始终是高涨的；在学习过程中，有过偏向，走过弯路，但是也获得了初步的成绩。
  恐怕睡着了，把闹钟放在床头。
    有许多生动的事实，证明学习情绪的高涨。如崔先生，白天因为照顾学校的工作，不能完全参加集体学习，于是他想出了法子：把闹钟放在床头，晚上睡几个钟头后，听见闹钟一响，就起来看书。吴先生，刚生小孩半个月，也来参加学习。还有一位六十岁的老先生，长痔疮不能坐，就站着参加学习讨论。十五组有一对夫妇有个小孩才八个月，为了学习和进步心切，把心爱的小孩放在家里，托咐他嫂嫂看。女的每天天刚吐白就起来做饭，学习也很积极，笔记，发言提纲都做得一点不马虎。这股学习热情的形成，是因为大家都认识到“学习是自己的事”，只有学习才能进步。
  “二十多年的糊涂观点，于今一扫光！”
    在短短的学习过程中，不论在思想认识及行动上，大家都得到很大的收获（特别是学习了劳动观点后），如：高先生总结他的学习说：“积累在脑海里二十多年‘英雄造时势’，‘历史是帝王将相创造的’这些旧的模糊观点，于今一扫而光”。申先生也说：“我学习了劳动创造世界后，从内心由卑视转为重视，由重视转为尊敬。现在思想上对劳动群众简直是羡慕了，同时对过去的轻视劳动，深深地受到内心痛苦的谴责”。张先生说：“不再摆知识分子的架子，不能再看不起劳动人民了，前些日子我破天荒的用小车到街上去拉水，街坊的李四嫂看见我很惊讶地说：‘先生怎么你去拉水呢？’”
  正确的学习大道是从弯路中寻找到的
    六百多个教职员在过去漫长的时间被旧习惯所束缚，从个人学习到集体学习，从单纯书本学习到理论与实际结合等新的学习方法的获得，是曾经走过弯曲的路的。首先是教条的学习，开始时有的小组，对于什么叫劳动？什么叫生产力，生产关系？想要下个定义，讨论了两天，结果定义还没有讨论出来，一周过去了，自己的思想还是“原封不动”！这种教条主义的学习方法，大家都感到成问题了，才转入与实际结合，与自己的思想结合的正确的学习方法。大家要求批评，自我批评了，但怎样作呢？开始前，先漫谈为什么要批评，自我批评？为什么要这样做？有什么好处！这一连串的思想问题在漫谈中都解决了，结果大家都很兴奋。小组长问：“准备好了没有？”十五张嘴都几乎抢着说：“我准备好了，批评我吧。”“我很多缺点，赶快批评我吧”，但小组长又说：“一切问题要通过自己的思想，主要是自我批评”，于是大家又楞了，后来又才慢慢地从生活上批评到思想上，行动上，批评就逐步地展开了。有个小组，开始的几天都不大说话，研究其原因是大家客气，不习惯，后来经过小组个人的自我介绍，互相帮助，大家熟悉以后，话也就多了。象王先生在学校时不敢发言，自己写的提钢叫别人念，现在也能积极的发言了。正确的学习道路是在过去旧的思想、习惯、作风中经过弯路与曲折才慢慢寻到的！
