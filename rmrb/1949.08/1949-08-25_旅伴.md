　　Travel Companion
    Panova
    (By Soviet Panova, translated by Su Ling, proofread by Cao Jinghua)
    Part One: Night
    Chapter One: Danilov
    Danilov encouraged the old man in a low voice, saying:
    "It's okay, Comrade Commander, we'll get along!"
    The commander carried a small suitcase with a pair of felt boots and a teapot tied to it. He came from Leningrad.
    He suddenly said in an excited, even heroic tone:
    "Oh, what can you do, there's no choice—let's go fight!"
    "Let's fight together," Potabenko said, looking happily at Danilov.
    "That's right, let's fight together," the little old man said.
    Danilov invited him to stay at his home. The commander waved the rubber raincoat draped over his arm and walked quickly. Danilov carried his suitcase, tied up with odds and ends.
    "Why are you carrying a pair of felt boots?" he asked. "Do you think the army won't issue us felt boots?"
    "You know, I've never served in the army," the commander replied, "and the information is really contradictory. Some say they will be issued, some say they won't. Then a woman said that with such a large army, there aren't enough felt boots to go around, so who would they issue them to first? Obviously, they wouldn't issue them to paramedics first. So my wife told me to bring them... just in case, right? It won't be a problem to wear them while working in the future, will it?"
    "Of course not," Danilov laughed.
    During dinner, the commander ate and drank heartily, talking about the architecture of Leningrad. Danilov looked at him and thought:
    "What am I going to do with you?"
    Early the next morning, Danilov went out to find an engine room driver—all the other staff were already in place—while the commander went to the repair shop to get a train. He had called the repair shop, evacuation service station, and train station in advance. The commander said smugly to Danilov:
    "Just find me at the station, both the train and I will be there."
    Danilov went to the machine factory. He had agreed with the factory manager last night that if the driver Kratsov was willing to come to the ambulance train, then he would let him go.
    Danilov understood why the manager was suddenly so generous. He just wanted to avoid any trouble and use a plausible excuse to get rid of Kratsov. Something must be wrong with Kratsov. Danilov investigated at the trade union. The answer he got was evasive: the driver was a highly skilled person who should be praised in every way, but—who is without fault?…
    "Is he a drunkard?" Danilov asked.
    "Who isn't?" they replied.
    His assistant was standing in front of the diesel engine; Kratsov was eating breakfast. He was sitting on an upside-down wooden crate, holding a bottle of milk in his hand. He had a gaunt, tired, saintly stern face. The hot air from the engine blew his pale hair on his forehead.
    "Oh, how is it?" Danilov asked. "Are you willing to serve on the ambulance train?"
    Kratsov put the bottle on the floor and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. He scrutinized Danilov with a pure and solemn gaze:
    "Go to the train?" Kratsov asked in return. "I'd be willing to crawl under a train! Save me from here, I don't want to stay here for another day."
    "What's going on?" Danilov asked solicitously. "Are things awkward?"
    "You know, Comrade Commissar," Kratsov said. "Let's be frank. I'm not a child. You understand that, right?"
    "I understand very well," Danilov said.
    "I've trained all the diesel engine management talents in this city. I don't need these Young League members to teach me."

    第一部　夜
    第一章　达尼洛夫
    达尼洛夫低声儿鼓励着老头说：
    “不要紧，司令同志，我们会相处得来的！”
    司令随身带着一只小箱子，箱子上捆着一双毡靴和一把茶壶。他是从列宁格勒来的。
    他突然用激昂的，甚至可以说是勇壮的口气说：
    “呵，怎么呢，没法子——我们去打仗吧！”
    “一块儿打，”波塔宾珂高兴的看着达尼洛夫说。
    “对了，一块儿打，”小老头说。
    达尼洛夫请他住到自己家里。司令挥着搭在胳膊上的橡皮雨衣，健步的飞快的走着。达尼洛夫提着上边捆着七东八西的他的箱子。
    “你为什么带着一双毡靴呢？”他问道。“你想军队里不会发给我们毡靴么？”
    “你知道，我从来没有干过军队呢，”司令回答道，“而说法也实在太矛盾。有的说发给，有的说不发给。于是有一个女人就说，这样大的军队，毡靴是不够分配的，那时候先给谁发呢？显而易见的，不会先发给救护人员的。于是我太太就叫我带上了……以备万一吧，不是吗？将来穿着办公不碍事吧？”
    “那当然的，”达尼洛夫笑起来。
    晚餐的时候，司令大吃大喝着，谈着列宁格勒的建筑，达尼洛夫望着他想道：
    “跟你一块怎么办呢？”
    第二天一清早，达尼洛夫就出去找发电室司机去了——别的工作人员全都请齐了——司令上修车场要列车去了。他预先给修车场，撤退服务站及火车站，都打了电话，司令就洋洋自得的对达尼洛夫说：
    “你到车站上找我好了，连人带车都在车站上。”
    达尼洛夫到机械制造厂去了。昨天晚上他同机械厂经理谈妥了的，就是说，如果司机克拉错夫愿意到救护列车上来的话，那他就放他来。
    达尼洛夫明白为什么经理突然这样的慷慨起来。他不过是免得吵吵闹闹的，好假借一个漂亮的借口，打发克拉错夫来就是了。克拉错夫一定出什么毛病了。达尼洛夫到职工会调查了一下。那儿回答得很支吾：司机是一个技术很高的人应该多方夸奖他，可是——什么人没有错呢？……
    “他闹酒吗？”达尼洛夫问道。
    “谁不闹酒呢？”人家回答他说。
    他的助手站在笛塞尔发动机跟前；克拉错夫在吃早饭。他坐在一个倒放着的木箱上，手里拿着一瓶牛奶。他带着一付枯瘦的，疲惫的，圣人似的严峻的面孔。发动机掀起的热风，吹动着他额上的苍白头发。
    “呵，怎么样？”达尼洛夫问道。“你愿意到救护车上服务吗？”
    克拉错夫把瓶子放到地板上，用手背擦了擦嘴。他用廉洁而庄严的眼光，把达尼洛夫端详了一下：
    “到列车上去？”克拉错夫反问了一声。“就让是往列车底下钻我都愿意呢！你把我从这儿救出去吧，我一天也不愿在这儿待下去了。”
    “这怎么一回事呢？”达尼洛夫殷勤的问道。“闹蹩扭吗？”
    “你知道，委员同志，”克拉错夫说。“咱们来明的吧。我不是小孩子。这一层你明白吗？”
    “很明白，”达尼洛夫说。
    “我训练了这城里所有的管理笛塞尔发动机的人才。我不需要叫这些青年团员们来教训我。”
