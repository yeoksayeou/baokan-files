    Organizing Production, Introducing Employment
    Providing Preferential Treatment to Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Servicemen
    The City Has Achieved Good Results in the Past Five Months
    Preferential Grain Distribution Must Be Focused
    Guarantee All Used for Production
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The work of providing preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen in Beiping is continuing. In the past five months, Beiping has achieved considerable results in organizing the production of families of martyrs and servicemen, introducing employment, tilling land on their behalf, and distributing preferential grain in a focused manner. Currently, the restoration and development of production is underway, gradually seeking to completely solve the employment and livelihood problems of thousands of families of martyrs and servicemen. Beiping currently has 9,026 households of families of martyrs and servicemen, totaling 30,674 people. Among them, 17,386 people are eligible for preferential grain subsidies, accounting for 53.3% of the total.

    The preferential treatment work in Beiping is the responsibility of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the People's Government. In March, April, and May, due to the recent takeover, cadres did not understand the situation in large cities, which affected the organization of production work. Therefore, in these three months, the majority of the effort was focused on understanding the situation and distributing preferential grain. The districts distributed a total of 270,816 jin of millet for the second quarter's military grain and 162,875 jin of pension grain. After summarizing the past work in June, the Civil Affairs Bureau initiated a new stage in the preferential treatment work in Beiping. In addition to conducting a general review and education of the families of martyrs and servicemen, the main focus is on organizing production, introducing employment, and mobilizing the masses to till land on their behalf, solving the livelihood of the families of martyrs and servicemen through production, and correcting the reliance on relief among some family members.

    In terms of organizing production, we are still in the period of creating and cultivating typical examples. According to statistics from the second, third, eighth, and tenth districts alone, 31 households are participating in sock knitting production, with 18 machines. The government provided loans of 250,000 yuan and two bundles of thread. The daily output is 52 dozen socks (excluding the three households in the tenth district), with a net profit of 9,800 yuan (excluding the four households in the eighth and tenth districts). These organizations frequently contact trade companies to exchange finished products for raw materials. As long as the government helps with funds and state-owned trade institutions help sell finished products, organizing the production of families of martyrs and servicemen is worth promoting on a large scale. In terms of introducing employment, according to incomplete statistics, the first, second, third, fourth, and sixth districts and the Civil Affairs Bureau itself have introduced 715 people. The majority of them were introduced to clothing factories to work as female workers, and some became primary and secondary school teachers, car drivers, office workers, nannies, etc. In the suburban areas, after the heavy rain in mid-May, under the call for urgently completing sowing, all districts first completed the entire sowing for the families of revolutionary servicemen. For example, in the fourteenth district, as a result of tilling land on behalf of families, exchanging labor, and mobilizing some family members to till their own land, 141 households cultivated more than 1,600 mu of land this year. Based on the current situation, the Civil Affairs Bureau is planning to assist the families of martyrs and servicemen in the suburbs who have labor power to become self-reliant, gradually reducing in-kind preferential treatment.

    However, due to the ideological ambiguity of some district cadres, they did not start to organize production groups and failed to actively contact various departments to introduce employment to the families of martyrs and servicemen. In addition, some cadres lacked knowledge of organizing and leading production and failed to establish close contact with trade companies and cooperatives, resulting in blindness in production and difficulty in selling finished products. As a result, some production groups in some districts were reorganized soon after they were established. These shortcomings should be overcome. In addition, there are still some problems in the preferential treatment work: (1) The idea of relying on government relief is still strong among military families, especially the families of soldiers who have just been liberated, the number is large, and the composition is more complex. If not handled properly, they can easily be used by bandits and special agents. (2) The resettlement problem of disabled soldiers. Because too much funding is required, before production is restored, self-reliance should be the main focus, and the government should provide assistance as much as possible. In the future, in addition to continuing to educate the families of martyrs and servicemen, in order to expand the organization of production, preferential grain can be distributed in a focused manner, and it must be guaranteed that every penny is used for production. Only in this way can the livelihood problems of the families of martyrs and servicemen be fundamentally solved. Of course, the government should still pay special attention to families who are elderly, infirm, and have no labor power. (Chao Qi)

    组织生产介绍职业
    优抚革命烈荣军属
    本市五个月来获良好成绩
    发优待粮须有重点
    保证全部用于生产
    【本报讯】北平市优抚烈、荣、军属的工作正在继续进行中。五个月来，北平组织烈、荣、军属生产、介绍职业、代耕及有重点的发放优待粮，已获得不少成绩。现正在恢复、发展生产中，逐步的求得彻底解决数以千计的烈、荣、军属的职业与生活问题。北平市现有烈、荣、军属九千零二十六户，共三万零六百七十四人。其中够享受优待粮补助的有一万七千三百八十六人，占总数的百分之五三·三。
    平市的优抚工作，是由人民政府民政局负责的。在三、四、五月份的时候，由于刚刚接管，干部不了解大城市的情况，影响了组织生产工作。所以在这三个月内，大部力量是了解情况及发放优待粮。各区共发出第二季优军粮小米二十七万零八百一十六斤；抚恤粮十六万二千八百七十五斤。该局六月份总结过去工作后，平市的优抚工作就进入一个新的阶段。除对烈、荣、军属进行普遍的审查和教育外，主要是组织生产，介绍职业，发动群众代耕，从生产中解决烈、荣、军属的生活，纠正部分家属依靠救济生活的思想。
    在组织生产方面，现还在创造与培养典型的时期。只第二、三、八、十等四个区的统计，共参加织袜生产的有三十一户；机子十八台；政府贷给资金二十五万元，线二捆。计日出袜五十二打（十区的三户不计在内），净赚九千八百元（八区、十区的四户未计在内）。这些组织经常与贸易公司取得连络，以成品换取原料。只要政府帮助资金和国营贸易机构帮销成品，组织烈、荣、军属生产，是值得大量推广的。在介绍职业方面，据不完全的统计，第一、二、三、四、六等区和民政局本身所介绍的已有七百十五人。其中大部是被介绍到被服厂做女工，也有的当了中小学教师、汽车司机、机关勤杂人员、褓母等。郊区的代耕工作，在五月中旬落透雨之后，各区在紧急完成播种的号召下，首先完成了革命军人家属的全部播种。如十四区由于代耕、变工及发动部分家属自耕的结果，今年完成抢种一百四十一户的土地一千六百余亩。根据现在情况，民政局正在计划协助郊区有劳动力的烈、荣、军属自力更生，逐渐减少实物优待。
    但由于部分区干部在思想上不明确，以致没有着手组织生产组及未能主动与各部门联系，给烈、荣、军属介绍职业。另外，又有部分干部缺乏组织领导生产的知识和未能和贸易公司、合作社取得密切联系，结果造成生产的盲目性；成品推销不出去。所以有的区的生产组，刚刚成立又改行了。这些缺点应设法克服。此外，优抚工作还存着些问题：（一）军属依赖政府救济的思想还浓厚，特别是刚获解放的战士家属，数目多，成份亦较复杂，处理不好，很易被匪特利用。（二）荣军的安家问题。因需经费太多，在目前生产未恢复以前，应以自力更生为主，政府尽量予以协助。今后，除对烈、荣、军育仍继续进行教属外，为了扩大组织生产，可以有重点的发放优待粮，要保证一文一毫都用到生产上去。只有这样，才能根本的解决烈、荣、军属的生活问题。当然，对于孤老病弱无劳动力的家属，政府仍应特别照顾。      （超祺）
