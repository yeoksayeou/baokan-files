　　Responsible Comrade of the North China People's Government Issues Statement
　　Clarifying Important Measures to Cancel Wartime Services
    In the Past Six Months, the People of North China Mobilized Over 40 Million People to Support the Front Lines; In the Future, Efforts Will Be Vigorously Shifted to Production.

　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The North China People's Government and the North China Military Region Headquarters jointly issued an order on the 19th of this month, canceling the wartime service mobilization measures. The full text was published in this newspaper on the 20th. Regarding this matter, which is of great importance to the burden on the people in the entire region and the future production and construction work, this reporter paid a visit yesterday to a responsible comrade of the North China People's Government, who made the following statement:

　　The people of our North China region, over the years, in order to win the victory of the People's Liberation War, have contributed all manpower, financial resources, and materials to support the People's Liberation Army in the arduous struggle against the enemy, enabling the People's Army to grow stronger and ensuring that war supplies are not in short supply. This is one of the fundamental factors that we have been able to defeat the enemy and win the complete liberation of North China. The price paid by the people for wartime service supplies over the years, whether in terms of scale or quantity, is unprecedented. Not to mention the distant past, but just looking at the period from November last year to April this year, in these six months, we successively supported the victories of the Huaihai, Pingjin, and Taiyuan campaigns, the annihilation operations against the enemy in the liberation of Xinbaoan, Zhangjiakou, Anyang, Xinxiang and other places, as well as the southward advance of the Fourth Field Army. The tasks came one after another without interruption. The scale of these campaigns was very large, with our forces ranging from 1.2 million in the largest to more than 100,000 in the smallest. The southward advance of the Fourth Field Army involved ×× number of troops advancing towards Jiangnan simultaneously in six routes. The enormity of the wartime service tasks was unprecedented, but the people of North China, in order to achieve the early arrival of national victory, overcame all difficulties and ensured the combat supply of the troops, so that the troops did not feel any difficulty in terms of grain, oil, salt, vegetable supply, ammunition and equipment transportation, wounded transfer, and repair of bridges and roads for combat equipment, directly guaranteeing that we were able to defeat the enemy in every campaign, and demonstrating the great power of the people and unparalleled sacrifice. In total, in these six months, only the incomplete statistics for the Huaihai, Pingjin, Taiyuan and other major campaigns (excluding the southward advance of the large army) show that the entire region mobilized a total of 47,360,000 (man-days) of civilian labor and 16,810,000 of animal power, transferring over 800 million jin of war materials. The usual military material transportation, dispatch of munitions from outside the region, transfer of wounded, rice milling, public grain transportation, guiding and sending messages, etc., were not included in the statistics. In completing these tasks, the people of the entire region overcame all difficulties, endured all hardships, and even risked their lives, fully demonstrating the people's love for the People's Liberation Army and their enthusiasm for supporting the front. For example, when supporting the Huaihai campaign by transferring military grain, the masses in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region mobilized 167,000 carts to complete the task of transporting 100 million jin of military grain from both the north and south banks of the Yellow River to the Longhai Railway and Jinan. At that time, it was the depths of winter, with severe cold and heavy snow. The grain-transporting masses ate and slept in the wind and snow, and had to cross the Yellow River along the way. The ferry crossings were often subjected to enemy bombing, but the masses still transported the grain at the risk of their lives, and many gloriously sacrificed themselves. In the rear, the men, women, old, and young of the entire village milled rice overnight to ensure timely delivery to the front. During the Pingjin Campaign, the masses in the Central Hebei and Chahar regions, in a short period of one month, mobilized all possible means of transportation, such as horse-drawn carts, handcarts, bicycles, livestock, boats, and icebreakers, to complete the transfer of 340 million jin of materials. In order to complete the transportation task, the masses rushed to repair the roads and bridges destroyed by the enemy, broke the ice and advanced, and milled rice day and night. Due to enemy bombing, grain transportation had to be carried out at night, but the masses' enthusiasm for supporting the front remained high, and the tasks were always completed on schedule. In supporting the Pingjin Campaign and the southward advance of the large army, the masses in the former Central Hebei, Southern Hebei, and Hebei-Shandong-Henan regions built a total of 168 bridges and culverts, especially rushing to repair the large pontoon bridge over the Yellow River, ensuring the rapid southward advance of the troops. The responsible person continued, the People's Government, in view of the fact that North China has now been completely liberated and the war is shifting to Central and Southern China, and that the people of North China have gloriously completed the historical task of supporting the liberation of the entire North China, should vigorously develop production and construction in the future, reduce the burden of labor on the people, and organize all labor and animal power to shift to production work, thereby restoring and developing North China's production and construction, and gradually improving the people's lives. Therefore, it has been decided that the wartime service measures previously promulgated by the provinces and regions, except for the substitute farming service and the voluntary transport of public grain into storage, which will be temporarily retained, all others will be cancelled from October onwards. This major decision is fully in line with the people's demands and is conducive to the future production and construction work in North China. It is hoped that the people of the entire region, under the leadership of the People's Government, will turn their past enthusiasm for supporting the front to production, embrace new historical tasks, and strive to complete the production and construction of the entire North China.

　　华北人民政府负责同志发表谈话
  　阐明取消战勤重要措施
    半年来华北人民曾动员四千余万民力支前，今后将大力转向生产。
    【本报特讯】华北人民政府及华北军区司令部于本月十九日联合发布命令，取消战勤动员办法，全文已志二十日本报，记者以此事关系全区人民负担及今后生产建设工作极为重大，特于日昨走访华北人民政府某负责同志，承其发表谈话如下：
    我华北地区人民，历年来为争取人民解放战争的胜利，在对敌进行艰苦斗争中，贡献了一切人力、财力、物力支援人民解放军，使得人民军队日益壮大，战争供应不虞匮乏，这是我们能够战胜敌人赢得华北全部解放的基本因素之一；多年来人民在战勤供应上支付的代价，无论从规模上与数量上说，都是史无前例的，远的不说，即以去年十一月至今年四月来看，这半年当中就先后支援了淮海、平津、太原三大战役的胜利，解放新保安、张垣、安阳、新乡等地歼敌作战，以及第四野战军的南进，任务一个接一个，从未间断，这些战役规模都很大，我方部队多者达一百二十万人，少者亦在十万人以上，而第四野战军南下，则是××万人马六路同时向江南挺进，战勤任务的浩繁是空前的，但华北人民为求得全国胜利的早日到来，以无比的热情，克服一切困难，保证了部队作战供应，使部队在粮＠、油、盐、菜蔬供应、弹药器材运输、伤员转送、作战器材修桥补路等方面没有感到任何困难，直接的保证了在每次战役中我们能够击败敌人，并表现了人民伟大的力量与无比的代价，总计这半年当中，仅就淮海、平津、太原等几个主要战役不完整的统计（大军南下不在内），全区共动员民力四千七百三十六万个（日工），畜力一千六百八十一万个，转运作战物资八亿余斤，而平时军用物资转运、外区军火调送、伤员转送、碾米磨面、公粮转运、带路送信等均未统计在内。在完成这些任务当中，全区人民克服一切困难，历尽艰苦，甚至冒险牺牲，充分表现了人民对人民解放军的爱戴与支前热忱。如支援淮海战役调军粮时，冀鲁豫区群众动员了十六万七千余辆大车，完成了从黄河南北岸调送陇海及济南一亿斤军粮任务，当时正是深冬严寒，大雪纷飞，送粮群众路宿风餐，中途尚须渡过黄河，渡口经常遭受敌机轰炸，但群众仍冒死运送，有不少光荣牺牲；在后方则全村男女老少连夜碾米，保证如期送达前方。平津战役中，冀中察哈尔两区在短短一个月的时间内，动员马车、手推车、自行车、牲畜、船只、冰船等一切可能利用的运输工具，完成了三亿四千余万斤物资的转运，为了完成运输任务，群众抢修了被敌破坏的道路桥梁，破冰前进，并日以继夜地碾米磨面，由于敌机轰炸，运粮须在夜间进行，但群众支前情绪始终高涨，任务总是如期完成。在支援平津战役及大军南下中，前冀中、冀南、冀鲁豫三区群众共修建桥、涵洞一百六十八座，其中特别是赶修黄河大浮桥，保证了部队迅速南进。负责人继称，人民政府鉴于华北现已完全解放，战争移向华中、华南，我华北人民已光荣地完成了支援全华北解放的历史任务，今后应大力开展生产建设，减轻人民的劳力负担，组织一切劳力畜力转向生产工作，从而恢复与发展华北生产建设，逐步地改善人民生活，因此决定将过去各省、区公布之战勤办法除代耕勤务及公粮入库义运暂予保留外，其余一律自十月份起取消，这一重大的决定是完全符合人民要求与有利于今后华北生产建设工作的，希望全区人民在人民政府领导下，将过去支前的热情转向生产，迎接新的历史任务，为完成全华北的生产建设而奋斗。
