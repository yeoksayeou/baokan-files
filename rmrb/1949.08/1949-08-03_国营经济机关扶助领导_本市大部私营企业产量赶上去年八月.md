    State-Owned Economic Organs Support Leadership
    Most Private Enterprises in This City Reach Output Levels of Last August
    [This Newspaper's Report] Private enterprises in Beiping City, under the support and leadership of the state-owned economy, are thriving. To date, most industries needed by the people have recovered to the production levels of last August when the Kuomintang imposed price controls during the "August 19th" incident. Many enterprises have even exceeded that level. Taking the weaving industry as an example, the city has a total of 460 weaving factories with 2,767 looms. Among them, 391 households with 1,539 looms have been assisted by the trade company. Many factories, such as Huabei and Gongda, were almost completely shut down before liberation, but have fully resumed production after receiving assistance. The trade company supports Beiping's weaving industry through methods such as lending yarn, exchanging yarn for cloth, and processing dyeing. Lending yarn provides factories with funding and raw materials that are struggling with capital shortages and unable to start work. Exchanging yarn for cloth and processing dyeing solves the problems of raw materials and sales channels. This not only solves the most pressing difficulties of various private enterprises, enabling them to resume production, but also provides and guarantees them appropriate profits, allowing them to continue to develop and expand production. For example, the Huaxing Dyeing and Weaving Factory has developed rapidly since receiving assistance from the trade company in April. The output of dyed cloth in May exceeded the total annual output of last year and the year before. In July, a new printed cloth factory was added, increasing the number of workers by 49 (a total of 60 workers have been added since liberation). So far, the factory is fully equipped from weaving and dyeing to printing, becoming a complete dyeing and weaving factory. As of July 10, the Production Support Department of the Trade Company's Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch had supplied 48,723 pieces of yarn to various private factories (including 5,160 pieces lent out) and received 65,888 bolts of cotton cloth. Currently, as summer is coming to an end, in order to adapt to seasonal needs and facilitate sales, the trade company recently held a production research meeting to support production, formulating a production plan for July, August, and September to switch to weaving autumn and winter goods. Another important aspect of the trade company's support for private enterprises is the assistance provided to more than 700 factories and workshops in over ten kinds of daily-use industries, such as knitting, soap, and matches. In June alone, the company supplied the factories with 1,200 bundles of yarn, 11,642 jin of tobacco leaves, 512 jin of white alkali, 21,023 barrels of bone glue, 6,795 barrels of white wax, 66 barrels of bleaching powder and vulcanized green and other pigments, and 1,300 pounds of match raw materials such as red phosphorus and phosphorus sulfide. During the same period, the company exchanged and purchased finished products from various factories, including 22,336 dozen towels, 42,103 dozen socks, 711 boxes of matches, 60,293 packs of cigarettes, as well as various finished products such as soap, vests, bed sheets, toothbrushes, black leather threads, and ink. In addition, in order to support the development of export industries, the trade company began providing trust services in June, supplying 20,716 jin of mung beans and 14,000 jin of white corn to support Beiping's vermicelli industry, purchasing 9,430 jin of finished products in June. Similar assistance was provided to the carpet industry, with 7,300 square feet of products purchased.
    The National Bank has also provided significant assistance to private industry in Beiping. As of July 19, the People's Bank had issued loans of 24,540,000 yuan to Beiping's special handicrafts industry. The 274 factories that received the loans began active production. The Beiping Communications Bank is specifically responsible for issuing industrial and mining loans to support their production. In April, it lent out 74 million yuan, and in May, it continued to lend out 231.55 million yuan. In June, it improved the loan methods, changing general credit loans to two types of loans: value-linked and order-based, focusing on supporting production. As of June 10, it had lent out 67.95 million yuan through order-based loans. The Zhongxing, Hongshun, and Siwei coal mines, which received these loans, avoided the annual summer slump and solved the sales problem during the off-season. Other companies, such as Dahua Pottery Company and Dazhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, solved the sales problem and expanded their machinery and equipment after receiving loans. The latter ordered six weaving machines from Shenyang with the capital acquired. In addition, private flour mills, iron industries, and others have also quickly recovered and gradually developed with the assistance of the trade company and the National Bank.
    All entrepreneurs are extremely excited and supportive of the People's Government's care and assistance, and their enthusiasm has greatly increased. For example, after receiving assistance from the trade company and loans from the bank, the Huaxing Dyeing and Weaving Factory prepared sufficient fuel and pigments. After receiving the loan, Dahua Pottery Company bought enough raw materials for four months and a machine, and built a warehouse. The owner of the Beiping Dyeing and Weaving Company was very excited after receiving a loan of 2 million yuan from the bank, and raised another 2 million yuan to buy ten German-style weaving machines from the Northeast.

    国营经济机关扶助领导
    本市大部私营企业产量赶上去年八月
    【本报讯】北平市私营企业，在国营经济的扶植与领导下，正欣欣向荣。至目前为止，凡是人民所需要的工业，大部已恢复到去年“八一九”国民党限价时的生产水平，有许多企业则已超过之。以织布工业为例，全市共有织布工厂四六○家，拥有织布机二、七六七台，其中经贸易公司扶助的有三九一户，有织布机一、五三九台。其中有不少工厂如华北、工大等，在解放前几乎是全部停工，经扶助后全部复工。贸易公司扶助北平的织布工业是用贷纱，以纱换布、加工染色等方法进行的。贷纱使资金困难无力开工的工厂获得了资金和原料，而以纱换布，加工染色等则解决了原料与销路问题。这样，不但解决了各私营企业最迫切的困难问题，使其恢复生产，并给予和保证其适当的利润，使之继续发展和扩大生产。如华兴染织厂自从四月获得贸易公司扶助后，便迅速的发展起来，五月份的染布产量，超过了去年、前年的全年产量，七月又新增设了印花布厂，增加工人四十九名（解放后共增加工人六十名），至此，该厂从织布、染色至印花都已设备齐全，成为一个完善的染织工厂了。至七月十日统计，贸易公司花纱布分公司扶植生产部，共供给各私营工厂纱线四八、七二三块（内贷出五、一六○块），已收进棉布六五、八八八匹。目前，夏季将过，为适应季节需要以利推销，贸易公司特于日前召开扶植生产研究会议，拟定了七、八、九三个月的生产计划，改织秋冬货品。贸易公司对私营企业扶助的另一个重要方面是对针织、肥皂、火柴等十余种日用工业七百多家工厂作坊的扶助，仅六月份供给各工厂原料就有纱线一、二○○捆，烟叶一一、六四二斤，白碱五一二斤，骨胶二一、○二三桶，白蜡六、七九五桶，漂白粉及硫化青等颜料六十六桶及火柴原料赤磷、硫化磷等一千三百余磅。同一时期换回和收购各厂成品计毛巾二二、三三六打，袜子四二、一○三打，火柴七一一箱，纸烟六○、二九三条及肥皂、背心、床单、牙刷、黑皮线、墨水等多种成品。此外，为着扶助出口工业的发展，六月份开始，贸易公司已举办信托业务，供给绿豆二○、七一六斤，白玉米一四、○○○斤，扶助北平的粉丝业，六月收购其成品九、四三○斤；对地毡业也给予同样的扶助，已收购其产品七、三○○方尺。
    国家银行对北平的私营工业同样给予了很大的扶助，至七月十九日统计，人民银行已先后发出二四、五四○、○○○元贷款给北平特种手工业，得到贷粮的二七四家工厂开始积极生产。北平交通银行，专负责发放工矿业贷款，以扶助其生产，四月份贷出七千四百万元，而五月即继续贷出二亿三千一百五十五万元，六月改进贷款方式，将一般的信用贷款，改为折实、订货两种贷款方式，有重点的扶助生产，至六月十日即以订货方式贷出六千七百九十五万元，获得该项贷款的中兴、宏顺、四维等三煤矿，由此而避免了一年一度的夏季滞销难关，解决了淡月中的销路问题。其他如大华窑业公司、大众染织厂获得贷款后，前者解决了销路问题，后者由于获得了资金，扩大了机器装备，从沈阳订购了六台织布机。此外私营面粉业、铁工业等，亦在贸易公司及国家银行的扶助下，有许多很快地恢复并逐渐发展。
    各企业家对人民政府如此关怀与扶助都极兴奋和拥护，积极性大为提高，如华兴染织厂得到贸易公司扶助和银行贷款后，即准备了足够的燃料和颜料；大华窑业公司得到贷款后，买了足供四个月的原料，和一部机器，兴造了一个仓库；北平染织公司在银行贷款二百万元扶助下，厂主很兴奋，又自筹了二百万元，去东北买德和式织布机十台。
