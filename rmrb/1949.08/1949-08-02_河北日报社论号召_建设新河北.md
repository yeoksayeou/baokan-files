Hebei Daily Editorial Calls for Building a New Hebei

[This newspaper report] The inaugural issue of the Hebei Daily, which was launched yesterday, published an editorial in lieu of a foreword entitled "Striving for the Further Unified Construction of a New Democratic Hebei Province," stating first: "The entire North China region has been completely liberated, and the situation of division no longer exists. The restoration of the original establishment of Hebei Province is not only possible but also highly necessary. In the future, all construction work in Hebei Province will be carried out under the completely unified leadership and planning of our province's Party, government, military, and civilian leading organs."

The editorial pointed out: "Hebei Province has transitioned from a war environment to one of production and construction. The rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, which concentrated the forces of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, has been thoroughly destroyed. Both cities and villages have broad prospects for development." Hebei Province has a vast territory and a large population, serving as a hub connecting the two major liberated areas of North China and Northeast China. The province has railways extending in all directions and rivers crisscrossing the land, providing favorable conditions for the development of transportation and water conservancy. Its culture and education are renowned as the best among the northern provinces, making it a major source for talent in future construction endeavors."

It continued: "Although Hebei Province is in a peaceful and stable environment and has more favorable conditions for restoring and developing various constructions, we must also recognize that while the open armed enemy has been eliminated, hidden enemies still exist. Enemy agents are lurking in cities and villages, colluding with landlords who have returned to their hometowns, scattered soldiers, bandits, and secret societies to carry out various sabotage activities, which has become a major obstacle to our construction work. We must not allow the slightest bit of paralysis."

Based on the above situation, the editorial pointed out the basic guidelines and tasks for Hebei Province's future work: (1) Make great efforts to rapidly restore and develop agricultural production. Lead and organize farmers with a high degree of initiative and enthusiasm to work hard in production, aiming to roughly restore the pre-war level within two to three years. (2) Rapidly restore and develop industrial production: first, state-owned industries; second, private industries that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood; and third, urban and rural handicrafts. (3) Restore, consolidate, and develop cultural and educational and health undertakings. Within two to three years, each county should establish a rural normal school, and vigorously develop national health undertakings to reduce disease and death. (4) Strengthen the construction of local armed forces, militias, and social security work. Political bandits, Kuomintang agents, and all counter-revolutionary saboteurs must be severely suppressed and resolutely eliminated. (5) Strengthen democratic governance. On the basis of fully mobilizing the masses, gradually establish county, city, and village people's representative conferences, and democratically elect county, city, and village people's governments. (6) Strengthen Party building, improve the Party committee system, convene Party congresses and representative meetings at all levels in a timely manner, establish a scientific work system, continue to overcome the state of anarchy and lack of discipline, and improve work efficiency.

Finally, the editorial called on all Party members in Hebei Province to continue to maintain the style of hard struggle, wholeheartedly rely on the working class, unite the broad masses of peasants, other working people, intellectuals, and the free bourgeoisie, and strive for the victorious realization of Hebei Province's new democratic construction tasks under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the North China Bureau.

    建设新河北
    【本报讯】昨日创刊之河北日报创刊号以“为进一步统一地建设新民主主义的河北省而奋斗”为题发表代发刊词的社论，首称：华北全境已完全解放，分割的形势已不存在，河北省原建制的恢复，不但可能而且是十分必要了。今后河北省各种建设工作，将在我省党、政、军、民领导机关完全统一地领导和计划之下进行。社论指出：河北省已由战争进入生产建设的环境，帝国主义，封建主义、官僚资本主义三者所集中表现的国民党反动派的统治，已被彻底摧毁、无论城市与乡村，都已具备了广阔发展的前途。河北省地区广大，人口众多，为华北与东北两大解放区联系的枢纽；境内铁路四达，河流纵横，对发展运输及水利事业准备了良好条件；文化教育素称发达，为北方各省之冠，这是今后各种建设事业人材产生之主要源泉。继称：河北省虽已处于和平安定的环境，具备了恢复与发展各种建设的更多有利条件，但我们还必须认识：公开的武装敌人固已被消灭，隐蔽的敌人依然存在，敌人特务潜伏在城中和乡村，与还乡地主、散兵、游勇、土匪、会门相勾结，进行各种破坏活动，已成为我建设工作中的重大障碍，绝不容许有丝毫的麻痹。根据上述情况，社论指出河北省今后工作的基本方针与任务：（一）以极大努力迅速恢复与发展农业生产。以高度的积极性和热情领导与组织农民努力生产，要求在两三年内大致恢复战前水平。（二）迅速恢复与发展工业生产：首先是公营工业，其次是有利于国计民生的私营工业，第三是城乡手工业。（三）恢复整顿与发展文化教育，卫生事业。两三年内每县要建立起一个乡村师范，并大量发展国民卫生事业，以减少疾病与死亡。（四）加强地方武装、民兵的建设及社会治安工作。对政治土匪、国民党特务及一切反革命破坏分子，必须严厉镇压与坚决消灭。（五）加强民主建政，在充分发动群众的基础上，逐步建立县、市、村人民代表会，民主地产生县、市、村人民政府。（六）加强党的建设，健全党委制；适时召开各级党的代表大会及代表会议，树立科学的工作制度，继续克服无政府无纪律状态，提高工作效率。社论最后号召河北省全党同志继续保持艰苦奋斗的作风，全心全意依靠工人阶级，团结广大农民、其他劳动群众、知识分子及自由资产阶级，在党中央毛主席及华北局的正确领导下，为胜利实现河北省新民主主义的建设任务而奋斗。
