    War Relics Photo Exhibition Closed Yesterday
    Total Audience Reached 40,000
    [Our Newspaper] The People's Liberation Army Anti-Japanese War and Liberation War Historical Relics Photo Exhibition held by the North China Pictorial Society of the Political Department of the North China Military Region at the Zhongshan Hall in Zhongshan Park closed yesterday (the 5th). During the five-day exhibition period, the audience reached more than 40,000. More than 120 units, including factories, schools, institutions, and troops, registered for group visits alone. In addition to audiences from this city, visitors also came from the Tianjin Telecommunications Institute, Zhangjiakou Women's Normal School, Northeast Military Academy, and Shanghai travelers.
    After seeing the photo exhibition, an audience member with the pseudonym "Fǎ Qín" wrote: "I deeply experienced the greatness of the people's anti-Japanese and liberation revolutionary struggle, and the future of China is bright..." A comrade working in the Municipal Government wrote: "The achievements of the People's Liberation Army moved me, and I am determined to carry out the tasks assigned by the superiors to the end."
    Two other audience members wrote: "I have never understood China's War of Resistance. Today I learned about the people's army and the power of the people." "People who have lived in the city for a long time only know how to celebrate liberation and victory; but they have never seen the arduous battles and heroic killing of the enemy by the People's Liberation Army, only heard some talk about it. After seeing these photos, I deeply realized that the Liberation War was very difficult, so all the people in the liberated areas should cherish this great victory and strive to participate in the revolution to make the national liberation faster."

    战迹影展昨闭幕
    观众共达四万人
    【本报讯】华北军区政治部华北画报社在中山公园中山堂举行的人民解放军抗日战争及解放战争史迹影展，已于昨（五）日闭幕。在五天展览期中，观众达四万人以上。仅工厂、学校、机关、部队集体参观登记者就有一百二十多个单位。除本市观众外，还有天津电讯所、张家口女师、东北军大及上海的旅客等前来参观。
    看了影展之后，一位署名“法勤”的观众写道：“深深的体验到人民抗日解放革命斗争的伟大，中国的未来是光明的……”一位在市政府工作的同志写道：“解放军的功绩，激动了我，要下决心把上级给的任务坚持到底。”
    另有两位观众写道：“中国的抗战我一直是不明白的，今天我才知道了人民的军队，人民的力量”。“久居在城市中的人，只知道庆祝解放，庆祝胜利；但是对于解放军艰苦的战斗及英勇的杀敌一点也没有见到，只不过听一些说说而已。看完这次照片以后，使我深深的知道，解放战争是非常艰巨的，所以我们全解放区的人民应当珍惜这伟大的胜利果实，努力参加革命，使全国解放更快一步。”
