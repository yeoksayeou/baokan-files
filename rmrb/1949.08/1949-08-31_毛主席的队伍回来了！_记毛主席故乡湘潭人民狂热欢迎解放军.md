Comrade Yang Yazhong, Director of the Political Department of a certain division of the People's Liberation Army garrisoning Changsha, excitedly told reporters: "The scene of the people of Xiangtan, Chairman Mao's hometown, warmly welcoming the People's Liberation Army is something that every officer and soldier present will never forget." He said: When the troops arrived at Wulidui on the bank of the Xiang River, there was not a single boat on the north bank of the river; but when the boatmen on the opposite pier realized that it was the People's Liberation Army, they shouted in all directions: "Ah! The People's Liberation Army is here, quickly row the boats over!" In less than five minutes, the scattered rowing boats and steamships had gathered on the north bank. The people on the boats ran down and warmly held the hands of the soldiers, saying, "We have been waiting for several days!" They rushed to transport the troops, and in less than an hour and a half, all the troops had crossed the river. When the troops were entering the city, an old boatman even said to me in a blaming tone: "Why didn't you give us a heads-up before you came, so we could have welcomed you..." As he spoke, they sent someone running into the city to report the news, and immediately the news that "the People's Liberation Army has arrived" spread throughout Xiangtan. At that time, most of the lights in the city had already been turned off, but in an instant, the entire city lit up again. Everyone poured into the streets, and groups of workers and students sang songs from factories and schools, running to meet the troops, some running four or five miles to greet them. As soon as the troops arrived, tea was provided everywhere, bucket after bucket, lined up along the street for a long distance. The peasants in the suburbs also heard the singing, shouting, and the sound of gongs and drums, and rushed over, and for a time the road was blocked. As soon as the villagers saw the cadres or soldiers, they said: "We have been looking forward to it day and night, Chairman Mao's troops have really returned today!"

Young men and women students were even more indescribably happy. Countless flowers were constantly thrown into the ranks of the troops, and some students even squeezed into the ranks, just smiling, just shouting, warmly bumping into the soldiers' shoulders, and some hugged the soldiers and shouted frantically: "Chairman Mao's troops are back!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" While thanking the welcoming masses, the troops continued to move towards the city center. The streets were even more crowded, and the sound of welcoming firecrackers resounded throughout the city. Many people squeezed into the firecracker shops, bought firecrackers and set them off, and the smoke from the gunpowder obscured the troops from view. The troops were squeezed by the welcoming crowd, turning double file into single file. On the main street from north to south, the welcoming people surrounded the troops everywhere, asking this and that, applauding and cheering. An old farmer named Liu squeezed into the circle after a long time. He warmly held my hand and said: "We have been looking forward to you day and night. Chairman Mao has been gone for more than twenty years. No matter how the Kuomintang and the Japanese bullied us, we Xiangtan people can never forget Chairman Mao!" I was moved and replied: "Fellow villagers, Chairman Mao has never forgotten you for a single day!" It was already twelve o'clock in the middle of the night, and the streets were still full of singing and laughter. The citizens asked the soldiers to live and eat in their homes. After the soldiers repeatedly explained that this was not allowed by the discipline of the People's Liberation Army, the citizens reluctantly let everyone go. When the troops entered the garrison, people surrounded the soldiers again, and everyone repeatedly asked about Chairman Mao. When the soldiers took out a picture of Chairman Mao for them to see, an old woman almost sixty years old took the picture and squeezed to the front of the electric light, looking at it and smiling, saying, "Ah! He's gotten much fatter!" The people surrounding the picture also talked about how Chairman Mao organized the peasant association in Xiangtan, how he studied, and how his family was, and so on. At this time, workers, students and citizens kept sending letters of condolence and carts of pork, vermicelli, and vegetables. At three o'clock in the dawn, when the troops were about to set off again to carry out new tasks, many workers and citizens sent them off more than thirty miles away from Xiangtan. Everyone couldn't help but say: "It really is Chairman Mao's hometown!"

　　“毛主席的队伍回来了！”
    记毛主席故乡湘潭人民狂热欢迎解放军
    黎阳
    警备长沙市的解放军某师政治部主任杨亚中兴奋地告诉记者说：“毛主席故乡——湘潭人民热烈欢迎解放军的情景，真是我们每一个在场的指战员所永远不能忘记的。”他说：当部队到达湘江边上的五里堆时，北岸江边还没有一只船；可是当对岸码头上的船夫发觉是解放军来了，他们就四面八方地喊起来：“啊！解放军来了，快把船开出去啊！”不到五分钟，疏散着的划船、汽船就都集合到北岸来了。船上的人都跑下来亲切地拉住战士们的手说：“我们已经等候好几天了！”他们抢着运送队伍，不到一个半钟点，部队全部都过了江。在部队进城的时候，一个老船夫还见怪似地对我说：“你们来为什么不给个信，让我们也好欢迎欢迎……”说着他们就派人飞跑入城报信去了，马上“解放军到了”的消息就传遍了整个湘潭。那时候全城大部灯火都已经熄了，但顷刻间，全城都又亮了。所有的人都涌到大街上来，成群结队的工人学生唱着歌从工厂，从学校，迎着部队跑来，有的跑了四五里地来迎接。部队一到那里，那里就出现了茶水，一桶接着一桶，顺着大街排得长长的。城郊的农民听到歌声，喊声、锣鼓声、也都赶了来，一时道路被阻塞得水泄不通。乡亲们一见了干部或战士们就说：“早盼晚盼，我们毛主席的队伍今天真回来了！”
    青年男女学生更是说不出的高兴，无数朵鲜花，不断地抛向队伍的行列里，有些学生更挤进了队伍，只是笑，只是喊，亲热地撞着战士们的肩膀，有的抱起战士疯狂似地喊着：“毛主席的队伍回来了！”“毛主席万岁！”队伍一边向欢迎的群众道谢，一边继续向城中心走去。大街上更是人山人海了，欢迎的炮竹声响彻了全城。有不少人挤进鞭炮店，买上炮竹就放，火药的烟子把队伍都遮的看不见了。队伍被欢迎的人群挤得双行变成了单行。在从北到南的大街上，欢迎的人们到处团团围住了队伍，问这问那，鼓掌欢呼。一位姓刘的老农民，挤了好半天才挤进圈子里。他热情地拉着我的手说：“我们一天到晚就是盼望着你们，毛主席走了二十几年了，我们湘潭人不管国民党、日本人怎样地欺侮我们，总是忘不了毛主席的！”我被感动地回答他说：“老乡们，毛主席也没有一天忘记过你们！”已经有深夜十二点钟了，街上还是一片歌声，笑声。市民们纷纷要求战士们到他们家去住去吃，经过战士们再三的解释，说明这是解放军的纪律所不允许的，最后市民们才勉强地放开大家。部队进到驻地，人们又把战士们围起来，大家翻来覆去地问着毛主席。当战士们拿出毛主席的像片给他们看时，一位快六十岁的老婆婆拿着像片挤到电灯前面，一面看，一面不住地笑着说：“啊！胖得多了！”围着像片的人们也就都谈起毛主席在湘潭怎样组织农民会，怎样读书，家里又怎样等等往事来。这时，工人、学生和市民们不断地送来慰问信和一车一车的猪肉、粉条、蔬菜。拂晓三点钟，部队为了执行新的任务又要出发时，许许多多的工人和市民都远送出离湘潭三十几里，我们每个人都情不自禁地说：“真是毛主席的家乡！”
