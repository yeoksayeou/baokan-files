    Municipal Cooperatives Open for Five Months
    Membership Reaches 180,000
    Saving 150 Million

    It has been five months since the liberation of Beiping. The Municipal Cooperative Headquarters has established consumer cooperatives in various state-owned enterprises, government agencies, schools, and through the trade unions of various industries in key streets of the urban area. A total of 185,546 members have been recruited (including the employees of various units and the families of other working people). During this period, because the cooperative, with the assistance and cooperation of the state-owned trading company, frequently sold a large amount of grain and daily necessities to all members at prices lower than the market price, it fully guaranteed their consumption needs; therefore, it saved this group of people, accounting for 10% of the total population of Beiping, from the huge losses of being exploited by intermediate merchants. Now, the cooperatives of various units in Beiping have won the support of the broad masses. The saying, "The cooperative is the economic organization of the working class itself," has been recognized by the general workers in five months of practice!

    The employees of the 53 state-owned enterprises in Beiping have benefited the most significantly. Under the leadership of the Municipal Cooperative Headquarters, they have completely established consumer cooperatives. As of July 25, the number of members in these 53 employee cooperatives has reached 141,206 (including family members), accounting for 84% of all employees. In the early stage, the business of these cooperatives mainly focused on supplying grain, but now it has slowly expanded to supplying about 100 kinds of daily necessities.

    After employees joined the cooperative, they not only avoided being harmed by "price increases," but also ensured a fixed ratio of wages to real goods. Taking the benefit that telecommunications operator Hou Yongming received from joining the cooperative as an example is the best proof. Hou Yongming invested in the cooperative in March. In the two and a half months from March 14th to May 30th, he bought a total of 613 jin of grain from the cooperative. If the difference between these grains and the market price of the day is accumulated, then, in these two and a half months, Hou Yongming spent the same amount of money in the cooperative, but bought 265 jin more grain than at the market price. In other words, the cooperative saved him 43% of the loss!

    Among private enterprises and the city's laboring people, the Municipal Cooperative Headquarters has not been able to fully take care of them in the past five months due to time and objective conditions, so they have not been universally absorbed into the cooperative quickly. However, the existing 14 street cooperatives (with industry workers as the main body) and the three employee cooperatives of private factories are equally supported by the masses. For example, in the Sixteenth Street Cooperative of the Twelfth District, most of the members are rickshaw pullers, and in order to reduce the freight of grain, they automatically use their own vehicles to pull grain to reduce the burden on the members. Because these cooperatives are run by the masses themselves, and at the same time give them practical benefits, they are particularly welcomed by everyone.

    In the past five months, the Beiping Municipal Cooperative Headquarters has supplied the above-mentioned 180,000 cooperative members with a total of more than 17 million jin of coarse grains, more than 7.233 million jin of refined grains, and more than 100 kinds of daily necessities, worth more than 169 million yuan. Compared with the market price, the total amount of grain and daily necessities saved a total of 153,446,500 yuan. This is a considerable burden that the Beiping Municipal Cooperative has reduced for the people in the past five months!

### 本市合作社开办五个月  社员达十八万  省钱亿五千万

    本市合作社开办五个月
    社员达十八万
    省钱亿五千万
    北平解放已经五个月了。市合作总社在各公营企业、机关、学校中，和通过各行业的工会，在市区各重点街道，分别成立了消费合作社，总共吸收社员十八万五千五百四十六人（包括各单位的职工和其他劳动人民的家属在内）。在这一时期里，由于合作社能经常在国营贸易公司协助和配合之下，发卖了大量低于市价的粮食和日用品给全体社员，充分保障了他们的消费需要；所以，使这批占全北平市人口百分之十的人们免去受中间商人剥削的一笔巨大损失，现在北平市各单位的合作社，已得到了广大群众的拥护，“合作社是工人阶级自己的经济组织”这句话，已经在五个月的实践中为一般工人群众所认识了！
    受到合作社好处最显著的要算是北平五十三个公营企业的职工了。他们在市合作社总社领导下已经把消费合作社完全建立起来。到七月二十五日为止，这五十三个职工合作社的社员人数已达十四万一千二百零六名（包括家属），占所有职工百分之八十四。在初期，这些合作社的业务是以供给粮食为主，现在已慢慢扩展到约有一百多种日用品的供应了。
    职工加入了合作社之后，不但不会吃“涨价”的亏，而且保证了工资对实物的固定比值。拿电信局话务员侯永铭加入合作社所得到的好处这件事来说，就是一个最好的证明。侯永铭是在三月里入股的。他从三月十四日到五月三十日的二个半月时间内，共向合作社买粮六百十三斤。如果把这些粮食和当日市价差额折实累计起来，那末，在这两个半月中，侯永铭在合作社化了同一笔的钱数，却比市价多买了二百六十五斤的粮食，也就是说，合作社替他挽回了百分之四十三的损失！
    在私营企业和全市劳动市民群中，五个月来因受时间和客观条件的限制，市合作总社不能全力照顾，所以没有很快地把他们普遍吸收到合作社里来。但现有的十四个街道合作社（社员以行业工人为主体）和三个私营工厂的职工合作社却同样受群众的拥护。比如十二区十六街合作社，社员多半是三轮车工人，他们为了减少粮食的运费，自动用自己的车子去拉粮食，以减轻社员的负担。这些合作社因为是群众自己起来办的，同时又给了他们实际的好处，所以它特别受到大家的欢迎。
    五个月来，北平市合作总社对以上两种合作社的十八万多社员，共供给了粗粮一千七百多万斤；细粮七百廾三万三千多斤；日用品一百多种，值一亿六千九百多万元。粮食和日用品加起来的数目与市价相比，共省钱一亿五千三百四十四万六千五百多元，这是五个月来北平市合作社替人民减轻了一笔数目可观的负担！
