　　Provincial Government Chairman Chao Che-fu Speaks
　　Calling for Strengthening Unity and Implementing Construction
    Subsequently, Comrade Chao Che-fu, Chairman of the Provincial Government, spoke, pointing out the significance of establishing Pingyuan Province: the establishment of Pingyuan Province represents a historical shift from war to construction, from feudalism to democracy. Regarding the question of how to develop production and construction, he specifically proposed mobilizing and organizing the masses to implement political construction and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. Finally, he emphasized the issue of unity, pointing out that only through unity can we successfully complete the task of building Pingyuan Province. We must learn from each other, respect each other, and if there are differences of opinion in our work, we should grasp the weapons of self-criticism and criticism, and resolve them through discussion. Liu Zhiyuan, Commander of the Military Region, reported that the future tasks of the Military Region are to suppress bandits, rectify and train troops, and strengthen militia construction. Subsequently, representatives from the Municipal Party Committee, railway workers, and other departments spoke, unanimously expressing their firm support for and acceptance of the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, Provincial Government, and Military Region. They pledged to strengthen unity, enhance learning, overcome difficulties, and strive, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, Provincial Government, and Military Region, to build a new Pingyuan Province.
