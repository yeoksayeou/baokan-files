[This City News] Since its takeover, the Beiping Water Company has greatly reduced costs through organizational streamlining, personnel reductions, leak repairs, electricity conservation, and the active work of its employees. In March, the price of each ton of water was equivalent to about two jin of millet; now it is only equivalent to one and a half jin. Monthly savings in expenses amount to over 100,000 jin of millet, approximately one-seventh to one-eighth of the company's income.

Before Beiping's liberation, the company had a large organization, with five sections and fourteen departments, and many redundant personnel. There were only 307 workers, but as many as 274 staff members. After the takeover, the five sections were reduced to four departments and a materials warehouse. Eleven special agents were purged and sent to the Qinghe Brigade for training. Twenty employees who had no work ability and relied on personal connections to get into the company were dismissed. During further reorganization, 67 employees were deemed surplus and were either dismissed, sent to the Municipal Government Training Class for training, or instructed to find other employment on their own. This alone saved more than 50,000 jin of millet per month. After the organizational adjustment, the business department was reduced from 110 people to 75 people, but the number of users increased by 300 households. Not only did this not hinder work, but the efficiency of handling affairs actually improved.

Under the leadership of the former bureaucratic organization, the factory's water pipes had been in disrepair for years, and water leakage was a major loss. In May, June, and July of last year, monthly water losses were over 440,000 tons, accounting for more than one-third of the factory's water distribution. Since May of this year, the factory has begun actively repairing leaks. In May, June, and July, average monthly water leakage was reduced to just over 270,000 tons. In August, two more leaks were repaired, further reducing water leakage by more than 100 tons per day. Since May of this year, the company has made every effort to use the Dongzhimen Water Plant's electricity-efficient motors, and the Andingmen Water Plant has also begun to supply water, eliminating the large amount of electricity consumed by the Dongzhimen Water Plant when running two pumps to supply water (the 150-horsepower motor at Andingmen is as efficient as the 200-horsepower motor at Dongzhimen). In addition, because water leakage has been reduced and employees at each plant have appropriately allocated water wells according to demand, electricity consumption has also been saved. As a result, the average electricity consumption in June and July of this year was just over 330,000 kilowatt-hours, a saving of more than 110,000 kilowatt-hours compared to the average electricity consumption of 446,000 kilowatt-hours in May, June, and July of last year.

The increase in actual water fee revenue is also an important reason for the company's cost reduction. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, "high-ranking officials and dignitaries" and privileged individuals such as military police mostly did not pay water fees. The water company only actually collected an average of just over 70 percent of the water fees each month. After liberation, water fees could be collected from almost all users, except for a few users who had special reasons such as relocation. In July, the company's actual water fee collection reached 96 percent of the amount receivable, greatly increasing revenue.

The quality of tap water and the water supply capacity have not deteriorated due to cost reductions; on the contrary, they have improved. Previously, water flow was not smooth during the day on the third floor of buildings in Beiping. Now, due to the water supply from the Andingmen Water Plant, water pressure can be maintained at 16 to 24 pounds, both day and night. Three of the four water storage tanks, which had not been cleaned for eight years, have now been cleaned successively. The bacterial content of the water leaving the factory is no higher than before. Moreover, because of the reduction in water leakage, the chances of bacteria and impurities entering the water are also reduced, and the water used by users is cleaner than before.

After liberation, workers have been actively working. Leak detection employees work at night, sometimes even having to hang upside down in the sewers to check for leaks. Thanks to their hard work, water leakage has been greatly reduced. Water meter repair workers only repaired an average of four meters per day in April and May, but this had increased to seven by July. In August, the work became even more meticulous. They even once worked overtime voluntarily at noon without taking breaks. Now, when the company purchases old meters, the repair workers still use their rest time to inspect them, without taking up work time for meter repair.

Although the company has achieved the above results in streamlining, saving, and reducing costs, it is not enough. For example, the monthly water loss due to leakage is still more than 260,000 tons. In terms of electricity consumption, some savings can still be made if the machines can be allocated properly. In addition, if a cost accounting system is established, quality can be improved and costs can be reduced. In order to implement the Beiping Municipal People's Representative Conference's resolution on streamlining and saving, the company plans to implement an accurate budget system from September, fill out daily records, find out the consumption quotas, and then discuss them with all employees to develop a water price cost standard. This will lead the old company, which has been without a system for more than 40 years, onto the path of enterprise management. It is currently studying how to allocate machines and continuing to check for leaks. At the same time, it is also preparing to quickly dispose of old and useless materials stored in the warehouse, and either transfer more than four tons of alum and more than 2,000 kilograms of soybean oil to other public factories, or auction them off.

### 自来水公司精简节约　成本大大减低　每月节省开支十万斤米

　　自来水公司精简节约
  　成本大大减低
  　每月节省开支十万斤米
    【本市讯】北平自来水公司接管以来，由于缩减机构，精简人事，检修漏管，节省用电，以及工人的积极工作，大大的减低了成本。三月份每公吨水价约合二斤小米，现在只合一斤半。每月节省开支十几万斤小米，约占该公司收入的七分之一至八分之一。
    平市解放前，该公司机构庞大，有五处十四科，冗员很多，工人只三○七人，职员竟达二七四人。接管后，把五处改为四科和一个材料库。清除了特务分子十一人，送到清河大队去受训。裁撤了没有工作能力依靠私人情面混入公司的二十个职工。在进一步整编时，编余了六十七个职工，分别情形，开除、送市府干训班受训或令其自行转业。这样，每月就节省小米五万多斤。机构调整后，业务科从一百一十人减至七十五人，用户增加了三百户，不但没有妨碍工作，办事的效率反而提高了。
    在过去官僚机构领导下，该厂水管年久失修，漏水是主要损失之一。以去年五、六、七月而论，每月损失水量均在四十四万公吨以上，占该厂配水量三分之一强。自今年五月起，该厂开始积极检修漏管，五、六、七月平均每月漏水减至二十七万多公吨。八月份又修补了两处，每天又减少漏水一百多公吨。自今年五月份起，该公司尽量使用东直门水厂用电少效率高的电动机，同时，安定门水厂也开始补水，免除了东直门水厂开双车补水所耗费的大量电力（安定门一五○马力的电动机和东直门二百马力的电动机效率相等）。又因漏水减少与各厂职工根据需水量适当调配水井，也节省了用电量，所以今年六、七月份平均只用电三十三万多度，较去年五、六、七月份平均用电量四十四万六千度，节省十一万多度。
    水费实际收入的增加，也是该公司成本减低的重要原因之一。国民党反动统治时期，“达官贵人”和军警等特权人物，大多是不付水费的，自来水公司每月平均只实收百分之七十强的水费。解放后，除少数用户因住址迁移等特殊原因外，都能收到水费，七月份该公司水费的实收数达应收数的百分之九十六，使收入大大增多。
    自来水的质地和供水能力方面，并没有因成本减低而变坏，相反的更提高了。以前平市三层楼上，白天出水就不畅，现在因安定门水厂的补水，无论白天夜晚，输水都能维持十六磅至二十四磅的压力。八年没有洗刷的四个储水池，现在已经陆续的洗刷了三个。出厂的水的含菌量，绝不比以前多。而且因为漏管的减少菌类和杂质混入水中的机会也减少，用户所用的水，比以前也更清洁了。
    解放后工人均积极工作，检漏的职工，都是夜间工作，有时甚至要倒垂着下到下水道去检查漏洞。靠着他们的辛勤，才使漏水大大减少。修水表的工人，在四五月时，平均每天才修四个表，到七月时，已经增加到七个。八月时，工作搞得更细致。他们并曾一度中午不休息，义务加班。现在公司购买旧表时，修表工人还是利用休息时间来检验，不占修表的工作时间。
    该公司精简节约减低成本虽已有以上成绩，但是还不够。譬如每月漏水的损失量仍达二十六万多公吨。用电方面，机器如能调配得当，还可以节省一些。此外，如果成本会计制度树立起来，更可以提高质量，减低成本。该公司为了执行平市各界代表会议精简节约的决议，准备自九月份起，实行精确的预算制，每日填写日录，找出消耗的定量，再由全体职工讨论，以编制水价成本标准。使四十几年来漫无制度的老公司，走上经营企业化的道路。现正研究如何调配机器，并继续检漏。同时并准备把仓库里旧存的废料和无用之物，赶快处理，把四吨多白矾，两千多公斤大豆油等物，或者转让给别的公营工厂，或者标卖出去。
