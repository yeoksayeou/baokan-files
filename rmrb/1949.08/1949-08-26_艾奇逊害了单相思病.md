　　Acheson is lovesick
    Song Ting
    Things have become clear today. The US imperialists’ “White Paper” has clearly told us: I wanted to eat your flesh in the past, and I still want to drink your blood today – this is the whole story of the US policy towards China. So why does he still dare to openly set up shop and clamor now? According to Acheson's logic, it is because "China's long-standing civilization and democratic individualism will eventually triumph again, and China will eventually overthrow foreign systems." Isn't this Acheson suffering from lovesickness? Within China, although there have been, and there will be in the future, such "democratic individualists" who want to form indissoluble bonds with it. But Hu Shi, Fu Sinian, Qian Mu, and their like have now become examples of what they are. The laws of history have clearly stipulated that whoever takes this path will be ruined.

　　艾奇逊害了单相思病
    宋挺
    事情到今天，再没有什么含糊的了。美帝国主义的“白皮书”已经清清楚楚地告诉了我们：过去我想吃你们的肉，今天还想喝你们的血——这就是美国对华政策的来龙去脉。那么他现在为什么还敢明目张胆地摆开摊子来叫嚣呢？按照艾奇逊的逻辑，是“中国悠久文明和民主的个人主义终将再度胜利，中国终将推翻外来制度。”这不是艾奇逊害单相思病吗？在中国内部，虽是曾经有过，而且将来也还会有这种“民主的个人主义者”想跟它结不解之缘的。但胡适、傅斯年、钱穆之流而今成了什么货色，已是一个榜样了。历史的法则已明白规定了谁走这条道路，谁就身败名裂。
