    The Red Flag Troops Who Flew Across the Yangtze River

    "This red flag is Chairman Mao's call, and also a firm order, for us to plant it in the south bank of the Yangtze tonight!" The instructor announced solemnly to the warriors and boatmen. He pointed to the red letter of request and continued, "This mission was obtained by us with several letters of request. The superiors care about us and trust us. This is our glory...."

    The warriors happily ate the biscuits sent by the division, while discussing: "Crossing the Yangtze River, this is only happening once in Chinese history! We must strive for the new title of 'Yangtze River Company' this time."

    Squad Leader Gao Yusheng said, "Our combat hero Ma Shaokong went to Beiping to participate in the National Youth Congress. He doesn't even know about this flag today. So many troops are participating in the assault tonight. If our squad doesn't plant it in the south, we'll be letting him down!"

    The comrades who were designated as the reserve team were very unconvinced, they were shouting: "Water combat is not like land combat, whoever moves fast is the assault team! Tonight, the Eight Immortals cross the sea, each displaying their unique talents, let's see who plants this red flag on the south bank first!"

    Special-class sailor Zhang Guozheng said with extreme excitement: "My opportunity to join the Party has come. I will be fully responsible for supporting everyone to the other side when the boat reaches the center of the river, guaranteeing that we can capture and hold the position, and plant the red flag at the breakthrough point."

    Wang Yuxia swore facing the red flag: "Liberating the south bank is liberating my hometown, I will crawl over even if I have to!"

    The boatmen were pointing and gesturing: "When we send you across the river tonight, I will be happy when I see you reach that dark mountaintop." Another said: "Crossing the Yangtze River, you are glorious, and I am also glorious. If I am wounded, I will lie on the boat and still send everyone over!"

    The red flag flutters in the wind in the position, summoning the heroic children of the motherland to strive for "eternal glory"!

    At six o'clock, tens of thousands of shells flew towards Xiangshan on the south bank, the assault front, sparks bursting on the mountaintop. When the second shell broke the tall pole of the Xiangshan lighthouse, it already told the enemy what fate the river defense would face! When the artillery fire made it impossible to see the mountaintop on the south bank, the boatmen excitedly shouted: "Let's go! No need to shout anymore!" Hundreds of boats, large and small, lying across the Yangtze River, sailed towards the south bank together.

    The enemy constantly launched flares, illuminating the ten-mile river surface red, machine guns and cannons shattered the silence before the fierce battle. The sail of a large boat was torn, and rags fell into the center of the river. Three large boats of an assault company lost their way and were spinning in the center of the river.

    "Comrades! Don't forget the task Chairman Mao gave us, sailors, this is the time to perform meritorious service, wherever there is gunfire, we will head there, heroes! Stand up straight and resolutely support the boat to the other side!" People are very familiar with this: it is the voice of the model instructor Zhou Fuqi.

    "Stand up straight! Resolutely support the boat to the other side!" One shout followed another, continuous heavy artillery shells bombarding the enemy's position on the south bank, like a sea of fire, encouraging people to move forward!

    Boatmen, sailors, and soldiers, everyone with one heart, all stood up together, steering, paddling, waving shovels, shouting and rowing. When the boat of the second platoon sailed in front of the assault team, all three boatmen were wounded, Zhang Guozheng rushed up, steering with one hand and bandaging the boatman's wound with the other, and constantly comforting him: "You shed blood for the poor, you have performed meritorious service for the people, you are very glorious!" The boatman also said: "I am determined to send you to the south bank." Saying that, he climbed up again and grabbed the rudder. He suddenly shouted: "We are brothers who share life and death, comrades, cheer up! Rush over!"

    Zhang Guozheng picked up a submachine gun and stood at the bow of the boat, saying: "I will cover you, row quickly! Strive to be the assault team!"

    "Zhang Guozheng is our hero!" The comrades on the boat cheered, and the boats on the left and right were also cheering. The instructor handed him a certificate of honor for crossing the Yangtze River, he smiled and took it, stuffed it into his pocket, and fell down beside the rudder with a smile. The boat still rushed towards the front of the enemy's bunker.

    The enemy arrogantly wanted to eliminate us in the water thirty meters away from the position, the flames of the flamethrower licked the bow of the boat, sparks splashed on the water surface, and bombs also continuously fell to the left and right of the boat. The communication boat following the regimental command boat was blown apart, and when the last person jumped onto the command boat, this small boat sank into the waves.

    "Bring the red flag over!" Squad Leader Gao Yusheng said, hanging the machine gun around his neck, and rushed towards the bunker. The enemy machine gun shooter, who was so fierce a few seconds ago, became a prisoner like a sheep, and the flamethrower also lay there quietly.

    "Comrades, get ready, down!" Platoon Leader Wang Jide said, holding the submachine gun in his hand, and rushed into the Yangtze River, detouring behind the enemy bunker, throwing a giant grenade, and then extending the muzzle into the bunker and strafing, the enemy lay in the bunker like dead pigs, the enemies in the communication trenches desperately ran towards the mountaintop, and the warriors chased after them to the mountaintop.

    The contact bugle sounded on the top of Xiangshan, and the third battalion commander in the enemy command post shouted in despair: "It's all over!" The sound of gunfire and artillery gradually subsided.

    Dawn broke, the red sun was behind the fleecy clouds, the red rays of light reflected the turbulent river water, thousands of large and small sailboats were rushing to transport the follow-up troops, the people on the north bank of the Yangtze River stood on the dikes and looked up at the red flag flying on the top of the mountain, cheering and congratulating the warriors heading south: "You have won!"

    飞渡长江的红旗部队
    方德
    “这红旗是毛主席的号召，也是一个坚决的命令，要我们今晚上插到江南去！”指导员很严肃地在勇士们和船工们面前宣布。他又用手指着红色的请求书继续说：“这个任务是我们用几封请求书请来的，上级关心我们，相信我们，这是我们的光荣……。”
    勇士们一面高兴地吃着师里送来的饼干；一面在议论着：“打过长江去，在中国历史上就只有这一回呀！我们一定要在这一回争取‘长江连’的新番号。”
    四班长高玉生说：“我们的战斗英雄马绍孔去北平参加全国青年代表大会，他还不知道今天有这杆旗，今晚上这么多的部队参加突击，要不是我们班里把它插到江南，那就对不住他呀！”
    决定作预备队的同志们很不服气，他们在嚷着：“水上运动就不象陆地，谁动作快谁就是突击队！今晚上八仙过海各显神通，看谁先把这杆红旗插到江南！”
    特等水手张国正极度兴奋地说：“我争取入党的机会到了。船到江心我一概负责把大家撑到对岸，保证打得下，守得住，把红旗插在突破口。”
    王玉瑕面对着红旗宣誓：“解放江南是解放我的老家，我爬也要爬过去！”
    船工们在指划着：“到今晚上送你们过江，看到你们到了那个黑黑的高山顶我就高兴了。”另一个说：“打过长江，你们光荣，我也光荣，万一我负了伤，我躺在船上也要把大家送过去！”
    红旗在阵地里迎风招展，它召唤着祖国英勇的孩子们争取“永远的光荣”！
    ×  ×  ×
    六点钟，千万发炮弹飞向突击正面的南岸香山，火花迸开山头。当第二发炮弹打断香山灯塔高杆的时候，这已告诉敌人江防将要遭到什么命运！炮打得江南看不见山头的时候，船工们兴奋地叫喊：“过吧！不用再嚷了！”横陈江面的千百大小船只，一齐驶向江南。
    敌人不断地放射照明弹，十里江面照得通红，机枪、炮，冲破恶战前的寂静。张了帆的大船，篷索被打断了，破布片飘落江心，有一个突击连的三只大船迷了方向，在江心里打转。
    “同志们！不要忘记了毛主席给我们的任务，水手同志们，这是立功的时候了，哪里枪响，我们就开向哪里，英雄们！直起腰来，坚决把船撑到对岸去！”人们很熟悉：这是模范指导员周福祺的声音。
    “直起腰来！坚决把船撑到对岸去！”一声紧接一声在呼喊，轰击江南的重炮弹连续在敌人阵地里爆炸，象一片火海，它鼓舞着人们前进！
    船工、水手、战士，大家一条心，都一齐站起来，掌舵、拿桨、挥动圆锹、喊着划着。二排的船开到了突击队前面的时候，三个船工全带彩了，张国正抢上去，一只手掌舵，另一只手给船工包扎伤口，还不断地安慰他：“你为穷人流了血，为人民立了功，你很光荣！”船工也说：“我下了决心，把你们送到江南。”说着又爬上去将舵抢过手来。他突然高呼：“我们是生死在一起的亲兄弟，同志们加油！冲过去！”
    张国正拿起冲锋枪站在船头说：“我掩护你们，快划！争取突击队！”
    “张国正是我们的英雄！”船上的同志们欢呼，左右的船上也在欢呼，指导员把一张抢渡长江的光荣证交给他，他笑着接过来塞进衣袋里，笑着倒在舵旁。船，仍然奔向敌人地堡前面。
    敌人狂妄地想把我们消灭在阵地前面三十米远的水里，火焰喷射器的火舌舐着船头，火花溅落在水面，炸弹也不断飞落在船左右，跟在团指挥船后面的通讯联络船炸破了，最后一个人跳上指挥船的时候，这只小船就沉没在江涛里。
    “把红旗拿过来！”四班长高玉生把机枪挂在脖子上说着就扑向地堡去了，在几秒钟以前还是那样凶恶的敌人重机枪射手却象绵羊一样当了俘虏，火焰喷射器也静静地躺在那里。
    “同志们准备好，下！”一班长王继德说着把冲锋枪端在手里扑进大江，绕到敌人地堡后面，投了一颗巨型手榴弹，接着把枪头伸进地堡扫射，敌人象死猪一样躺在地堡里，交通壕里的敌人没命地奔向山头，勇士们就尾追到山头。
    联络号音在香山顶响起，敌人指挥所里的第三营营长失神地大叫：“这下完了！”枪声炮声渐渐沉寂了。

    天亮了，红日在絮云的后边，红色的光芒射映着滔滔江水，千百只大小帆船正赶运后续部队，大江北岸的人民站在堤坝上翘望山顶飘扬的红旗，对向南开进的勇士们欢呼祝贺：“你们胜利了！”（转载上海解放日报）
