　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 21st: The restoration and development of the machine industry is one of the important keys determining the speed of future economic construction in Northeast China. After inspecting the production and construction work in the first half of the year, the Machine Industry Bureau of the Industry Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee has, based on new tasks, re-formulated a production recovery plan for the second half of the year, and determined that the construction policy of the machine industry in the future is: to serve industry and mining, and at the same time, appropriately strengthen itself. Currently, various machinery factories are re-adjusting machines and manpower according to the principle of centralized and effective use, in order to maximize production efficiency and meet the needs of the current large-scale industrial construction in Northeast China.
　　The Northeast Machine Industry Bureau has jurisdiction over twelve large production units, with more than 11,000 workers. According to existing equipment conditions, it can manufacture dozens of types of machine tools, industrial and mining machinery, air compressors, water pumps, ball bearings, grinding wheels, oxygen, etc. However, due to the development of various industrial constructions, the requirements for the machinery manufacturing industry from all parties are also increasing. Currently, in the order forms submitted by only some factories and mines to the Machine Industry Bureau, there are already hundreds of types of machines. To this end, the factories under the bureau are now formulating specific plans according to the new order tasks, and mobilizing all employees to give play to their enthusiasm and creativity, overcome difficulties, and ensure the full completion of the plans. The Machinery Bureau also requires all factories to strictly abide by product specifications, improve quality, and deliver on time, so as not to affect the completion of the production plans of other factories and mines. But even so, if we rely solely on the existing equipment capacity of the factories under the Machine Industry Bureau to meet the needs of the vigorous restoration and development of industry, mining and transportation in Northeast China today, it is still far from enough. The reason is that the foundation of the machine industry in Northeast China is far weaker than other heavy industries. During the pseudo-Manchukuo period, the Japanese imperialists regarded Northeast China as a market for the Japanese domestic machine industry, making the machine industry in Northeast China very underdeveloped. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, in order to avoid the threat of air raids on the mainland machine industry, the Japanese imperialists moved some of the machine industry to Northeast China, but it was extremely dispersed, without an independent and complete system. The vast majority was attached to major mines and factories, and the scale was small, unable to manufacture large and sophisticated machines. After "August 15th," the machine factories were successively severely destroyed by the Japanese imperialists and the Kuomintang, with about 90% of the machinery and equipment damaged. Therefore, to transform such a colonial-style industry and restore such a dilapidated industry, so as to build an independent and autonomous machine industry in Northeast China, is an extremely arduous and complex task.
　　At present, there are still nearly nine times as many machine tools as those belonging to the Machine Industry Bureau, scattered in various public factories and mines, some of which can only be started after being repaired. The privately-run machine factories have about four to five thousand machines, also scattered in various provinces and cities. In view of this situation, the Machine Industry Bureau has paid attention to close cooperation with local public and private machine industries, placing orders with each other and processing each other, in order to organize and give play to the existing mechanical power in Northeast China.
　　The machine industry is an extremely complex heavy industry. For example, to manufacture a lathe, more than 40 kinds of large and small parts are needed. At present, the technical personnel of the Machine Industry Bureau in this regard are still relatively weak. But in the past six months, relying on the enthusiasm and creative spirit of the workers, difficulties have finally been gradually overcome, and the newly built 52 machine tools and the repaired 1,231 machines (originally planned to repair 1,000 units throughout the year) have been installed. The technical level and labor productivity of the workers have also been greatly improved compared with before. For example, in the Second Machine Factory, in March, it took a worker seven hours to make a pair of chuck jaws (a part on machines such as lathes and milling machines). By July, the same worker could produce five pairs in eight and a half hours of work a day. In the past, it took 26 hours to make a spindle, but recently it only takes 6 hours to complete. In order to cultivate technical workers and technical personnel in a planned way, the Northeast Machine Industry Bureau has established a technical school, which currently has 600 students, divided into three classes: skilled workers, staff cadres, and drafting, adopting a training method that combines theory and practice and on-site internships.
　　In addition, starting in May, the twelve factories under the bureau thoroughly conducted an inventory of assets, in preparation for implementing economic accounting. In August and September, all factories will universally implement a daily work record system, in order to grasp the production process, achieve scientific quota management, and implement an over-quota bonus wage system on this basis, to improve the operation and management of the machine industry.

### 适应全面经济建设需要　东北加强机械工业  确定为工矿服务的建设方针制订下半年生产恢复计划

　　适应全面经济建设需要
  　东北加强机械工业
    确定为工矿服务的建设方针制订下半年生产恢复计划
    【新华社沈阳二十一日电】机械工业的恢复与发展，是决定今后东北经济建设进展速度的重要关键之一。东北行政委员会工业部机械工业管理局，在检查了上半年的生产与修建工作之后，已根据新的任务，重新制订了下半年生产恢复计划，并确定今后机械工业的建设方针是：为工矿服务，同时适当壮大自己。现各机械工厂正依据集中有效使用的原则，重新调整机器、人力，以发挥最大生产效能，适应目前东北大规模工业建设的需要。
    东北机械工业管理局共辖十二个大的生产单位，拥有工人一万一千余名。按现有设备条件，可以制造母机、工矿机器、空气压缩机、水泵、滚珠、砂轮、氧气等数十类。但由于各种工业建设的发展，各方对机械制造业的要求亦日益增加，目前仅部分工厂、矿山交付机械工业管理局的定货单中，即已有机器数百种之多。为此，该局所属各工厂现正按照新的定货任务，分别制订具体计划，并动员全体职工，发挥积极性和创造性，克服困难，保证计划全部完成。机械管理局亦要求各厂严格遵守产品规格，提高质量，按时交货，以免影响其他工厂、矿山生产计划的完成。但即使如此，如果单靠机械工业管理局各工厂现有的设备能力，来满足东北今天工矿交通蓬勃恢复与发展的需要，还是很不够的，原因是东北机械工业的基础远较其他重工业薄弱。伪满时期，日寇把东北作为日本本国机械工业的市场，使东北机械工业极少发展；太平洋战争爆发后，日寇为了避土免本机械工业遭空袭威胁，曾将部分机械工业迁来东北，但又极其分散，没有独立自成一套的系统，绝大部分是附设于各大矿山与工厂中，规模亦小，不能制造大型与精密的机器。“八一五”后，各机械厂又陆续遭日寇和国民党的严重摧毁，机器设备破坏者约达百分之九十左右。因此要改造这样的殖民地性质的和恢复这样残破不堪的工业，从而建设东北独立自主的机械工业，是一个极其艰巨而复杂的任务。
    目前全东北尚有约近九倍于机械管理局所属的工作机器，分散在各个公营工厂与矿山中，其中有一部分待修理后才能开动；私人经营的机器厂，其约有四、五千台机器，亦分散在各省、市中，机械工业管理局鉴于此种情况，已注意与各地公、私营机械工业密切配合，互相定货，互相加工，以组织和发挥东北现有机械力量。
    机械工业是一种极其复杂的重工业，如制造一台车床，就需要四十多种大小零件。目前机械管理局在这方面的技术人员，还相当薄弱。但半年来，依靠职工的积极性和创造精神，终于逐步克服困难，把新造的五十二台母机和修复的一千二百三十一台（原计划全年修复一千台）机器安装起来。工人的技术水平和劳动生产率亦已较前大为提高。如第二机器工厂，在三月间一个工人作一对卡盘抓（车床、铣床等机器上的一种零件）需要七小时，到七月份，还是那一个工人，一天工作八小时半，就可以造出五对。过去造一个主轴要二十六小时，最近只用六小时即可完成。为有计划地培养技术工人与技术人员，东北机械工业管理局已设立技术学校，现有学员六百名，分为技工、职员干部、绘图三班，采取理论与实际结合，现场实习的训练方法，进行培养。
    此外，自五月间开始，该局所属十二个工厂，曾彻底进行了一次清理资财工作，为实行经济核算作准备。八、九两月份，各厂将普遍实行每日工作记录制，借以掌握生产进程，达到科学的定额管理，并在此基础上实行超额奖励工资制，改进机械工业的经营与管理。
