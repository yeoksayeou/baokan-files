Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th:

The main content of the lengthy White Paper entitled "United States Relations with China," published by the U.S. State Department on the fifth of this month, and other related materials, is now known to the Chinese people. What lessons should the Chinese people learn from the U.S. government's White Paper and Secretary of State Acheson's statements?

The first and most fundamental lesson to be learned is the deep-rooted hostility of the U.S. imperialist government towards the national interests of China and the democratic forces of the Chinese people. The U.S. White Paper does not conceal the U.S. government's imperialist and aggressive stance. The U.S. government brazenly and shamelessly declares that "non-interference in China's internal affairs" is impossible because it "conflicts with 'supporting China's unity and territorial integrity'." In other words, the U.S. government believes that it must interfere in China's internal affairs, it must regard China as a U.S. protectorate, and then China can have so-called "unity and territorial integrity"! According to this Hitlerian arbitrariness, the U.S. government, despite acknowledging that Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang is a group of "reactionaries no different from past warlords" and that their government "has lost the support of the people," still "continued to devote all its efforts to assisting" it "for obvious reasons" so that it could "establish its authority in as large an area of China as possible." What exactly are these "obvious reasons"? The U.S. government gave this reactionary government, which is unsupported by the people, "more aid than the United States has given to any other country," amounting to "more than fifty percent of the money it spent." What exactly was this for? What mysterious "friendly" purpose did the U.S. government have in providing such huge assistance "in transporting, arming and supplying" a reactionary army that had already "lost its fighting spirit," supplying it with "most of its military supplies," enabling it to once use military means (remember: this is what the U.S. government calls "encouraging both sides to engage in consultations and strive to avoid the outbreak of civil war"!) to "extend its control to most of North China and Northeast China"? Anyone with a clear mind and a minimum of reasoning ability cannot but conclude that the U.S. government is resolutely and consistently pursuing the goal of aggression against China. The reason why the U.S. government seemingly groundlessly aids a reactionary government and its reactionary army, unsupported by the people, to attack the vast people of China who refuse to support the reactionary rule, is an ulterior "reason": since the U.S. government's policy of aggression violates the will of the Chinese people and the rights and interests of the Chinese nation, the U.S. government cannot expect to obtain the cooperation of the Chinese people, and it cannot but arbitrarily interfere in China's internal affairs, in order to establish in China by military means a Quisling-style traitorous puppet government that can "cooperate" with the U.S. government. Is there any other explanation besides this?

The White Paper vainly and hypocritically speaks a great deal about Sino-American friendship. This friendship does exist, and will continue to exist forever, but it only exists between the American people and the Chinese people, because the American people have no motive or need to invade China, and have provided each other with unforgettable mutual assistance in many ways. As for the U.S. government's acts of aggression, even Acheson cannot but admit that this is something that the American people "would clearly not allow." Acheson wrote in his letter to Truman: If the United States takes further intervention today, it "will inevitably arouse the resentment of the Chinese people and be condemned by the American people." How strange! If the U.S. government truly holds a friendly attitude towards the Chinese people, why would expanding the scope and breadth of this friendship (for example, if the U.S. government had aided the Chinese people during the Anti-Japanese War instead of aiding the evil government opposed by the Chinese people) arouse the resentment of one side of this friendship and the condemnation of the other side? Is this not sufficient proof that the U.S. government harbors not friendship, but only aggressive ambitions that are outrageous and must be condemned? Given that this is the case, does limiting the scope and breadth of these aggressive ambitions (for example, if the Japanese aggressors did not occupy Yan'an and Chongqing but stopped on the east bank of the Yellow River and southern Guizhou) cause people to stop being outraged and condemning? The U.S. imperialists imagine that the whole world is stupid, but the result shows that it is they themselves who are truly stupid.

And in fact, how does the U.S. government determine the scope and breadth of its aggression? The expansion demanded by imperialists according to the demands of monopoly capital knows no bounds; if there is any limit, it is certainly not because of fear of people's outrage and condemnation. Has the record of outrage and condemnation not already piled up thicker than the White Paper? It is because the imperialists' own power is limited. Regarding what results the U.S. government's aid to the Kuomintang has achieved, Acheson wrote: "Our aid and encouragement have helped them resist. The unfortunate but unavoidable fact is that the unfortunate result of the Chinese civil war is beyond the control of the U.S. government. Nothing that the United States has ever done or could have done within the reasonable limits of its capabilities can change this result. What the United States has not done has no impact on this result. This is the product of internal forces in China, forces that the United States has also tried to influence, but has been unable to do so effectively." Look! This is the useful confession made to the world by the U.S.'s insatiable but ultimately defeated interventionists and aggressors! Only resolute and effective struggle, thoroughly defeating and overthrowing the imperialists, will stop the imperialists' footsteps, and in the end, this disgusting thing called imperialism will be eliminated.

But the question today is: have the interventionists and aggressors in China given up here? No, in this sense, their ambitions are still limitless. "One will not give up until reaching the Yellow River," this proverb cannot generally be applied to the imperialists. Despite how disappointed the U.S. government is in using Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang as a tool, as long as there is still a single soldier or a single special agent of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the U.S. government will never cease to use them. The same Acheson stated just a month ago, on July 6: "The United States is sending Nationalist China all the economic aid that it can now provide." But even if it is dead to the Kuomintang, the U.S. government's heart will not die when it comes to continuing to interfere in and invade China, continuing to undermine the cause of the Chinese people's liberation and construction. Acheson has blatantly announced that all opposition to the "development" of the people's democratic politics that the "internal forces in China" have already achieved today will be "encouraged" by the U.S. government. Acheson also issued a special statement the day after the White Paper was released, on August 6, putting forward his so-called five principles. If these principles are interpreted with science instead of deception, they are: (1) The U.S. government is willing to encourage, by every feasible means, developments that promote China's becoming a U.S. colony, so that it can take on the task of being a puppet of U.S. imperialists in international affairs. (2) The U.S. government is willing to help China establish an economic and political environment that can protect the human rights and freedoms of U.S. imperialist agents and gradually develop the welfare of the U.S.'s colonial economy and comprador class. (3) The U.S. government opposes China's independence from its interference, and opposes any regime that does not serve the interests of U.S. monopoly capital. The U.S. government opposes any foreign country aiding China with an equal and friendly attitude. (4) The U.S. government will continue to consult with other imperialist countries colonizing the Far East, referring to the situation in the entire Far East in relevant countries, on methods that will help those countries continue to maintain their imperialist privileges in the Far East. (5) The U.S. will force the United Nations to achieve the above goals, especially efforts related to maintaining imperialist aggression against the Far East. From this, it can be seen that the U.S. government is determined to continue to undermine people's democratic China from within and oppress people's democratic China from without. From this, it can be seen that as long as the United States remains an imperialist country and has not become a people's country, the U.S. government is determined to be hostile to the Chinese people to the end.

To date, the Chinese people have only strived to restore and protect their legitimate interests, and have never sent a single soldier or advisor across the ocean to the United States to interfere in the development of that country's "internal forces," to support that country's "unity and territorial integrity." Is this not a clear and obvious fact? However, U.S. imperialism wants to interfere in China in the past, present, and future, to undermine the Chinese people's great patriotic movement, to force China to be subordinate to U.S. imperialism, and to serve the interests of U.S. imperialism. Is this not a clear and obvious fact? Therefore, U.S. imperialism is the irreconcilable enemy of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people. Is this not a clear and obvious fact?

Therefore, the second lesson that the Chinese people should learn from the U.S. White Paper is that the Chinese people must continue to resist and guard against any interference and challenge from the enemy, U.S. imperialism, and must not fall into any trap set by the enemy, U.S. imperialism. Whatever the enemy fears, we must do; whatever the enemy likes, we must not do. The U.S. aggressors call on certain Chinese people (in Acheson's words, these people are called "democratic individualists") to organize anti-communist factions in order to overthrow the people's democratic regime led by the Communist Party. Every patriotic and self-respecting Chinese person must not do this, and the Chinese people will certainly not allow this to be done. The U.S. aggressors vainly attempt to lure the Chinese people with some temporary and superficial material "aid" in the face of the Chinese people's economic difficulties, like drinking poison to quench thirst and abandoning independence. Every patriotic and self-respecting Chinese person must not do this, and the Chinese people will certainly not allow this to be done. The U.S. aggressors vainly attempt to sow discord between the Chinese people and the Soviet Union's fraternal friendship, in order to divide the anti-imperialist and anti-aggression alliance of the Far East and the world. Every patriotic and self-respecting Chinese person must not do this, and the Chinese people will certainly not allow this to be done.

The U.S. White Paper spreads all kinds of absurd and malicious slanders against the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party before the American people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world, for example, saying that the Chinese Communist Party did not work hard to resist Japan, for example, saying that the Chinese Communist Party did not work hard for domestic peace after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, for example, saying that the Chinese Communist Party "serves the interests of foreign imperialism," while at the same time, it tries its best to dilute the crimes of the Kuomintang, and calls some new tools, which the U.S. aggressors imagine in their daydreams as being more useful than the Kuomintang, the "backbone of Chinese democracy," etc. But these absurd claims are simply so naive that they are not worth refuting. For a long time, the truth about the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang has been reported to the American people by many American observers in China, including such figures as General Stilwell. Acheson asserts that "in the recent past, foreign attempts to control China were clearly seen by the Chinese people as foreign aggression, and were therefore met with serious resistance." Acheson seems to have some clarity of mind here. But he goes on to assert that the world suddenly changed greatly, and these serious resistors themselves suddenly "worked for the interests of foreign imperialism"; after a while (probably a minute), the Chinese people suddenly disagreed with this statement, and "clearly regarded it as having its native and national character"; instead, the Kuomintang, which the U.S. government is working hard to help restore its "sovereignty," is recognized as "working for the interests of foreign imperialism," and the Chinese people frankly pointed out that this foreign imperialism is first and foremost the U.S. imperialism represented by the likes of Truman, Marshall, Acheson, and Stuart.

U.S. imperialism's attempt to control China is clearly seen by the Chinese people as foreign aggression, and is therefore met with serious resistance. Another thing that the Chinese people clearly see is that the Soviet Union has not interfered in China's internal affairs. Even Acheson himself cannot but admit that the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War is "the product of internal forces in China," and that "most of the military supplies" of both sides of the Chinese civil war were supplied by the United States. Then, regarding the question of who is the aggressor and its agents, is it the U.S. imperialists, who are confused due to defeat, who see things more clearly, or the 475 million Chinese people, who have had a patriotic stance for decades, who see things more clearly? There is no doubt that Acheson, despite admiring his own genius for self-contradiction, can never convince the world, and can never shake the Chinese people's firm belief in objective truth by even a bit.

The U.S. White Paper also attacks the Kuomintang, and one of its purposes is to induce people to think that the U.S. government ultimately also has some objective attitude. But why does the White Paper attack the Kuomintang? This is the aggressor's attack on its running dogs, just like the Japanese aggressors' attack on Wang Jingwei. As Acheson said, Wedemeyer's report, which attacked the Kuomintang, still "expressed sympathy for the various problems of the Nationalist government." Sympathy, but dissatisfaction, because the Kuomintang did not "work well for the interests of foreign imperialism," causing imperialist aid to be ineffective, and causing imperialist interests to be destroyed. Strictly speaking, the U.S. aggressors' attack on the Kuomintang is unfair, because first, none of the Kuomintang's reactionary actions were not deepened by the U.S. government's "aid and encouragement." Without the U.S. government's "aid and encouragement," the Kuomintang would not dare to cause such a monstrous disaster; second, the Kuomintang's corruption came with its reactionary nature, and this corruption was at least deepened by the example of the United States. The Kuomintang newspaper in Guangzhou said it right on the tenth of this month: "The U.S. government accuses Chinese (Kuomintang) officials of corruption and malpractice, which is an undeniable fact. But the American personnel sent to China are no less corrupt than the Chinese bureaucrats. For example, in the 'post-war relief' matters and the 'economic cooperation' work in recent years, the facts of corruption and malpractice by American personnel are truly countless." A crab scolds its son for walking sideways, and the ugly monster Caliban in Shakespeare's comedy hates his ugly appearance in the mirror. This is the true meaning of the U.S. White Paper's condemnation of the Kuomintang.

In short, fundamentally speaking, the U.S. White Paper is indeed a masterpiece of reversing black and white. If this reversal of black and white is reversed again, people can obtain all kinds of useful lessons from it. Through the U.S. White Paper, the Chinese people have further recognized the imperialist face of the U.S. government, further recognized how to fight against U.S. imperialism, and finally, can further recognize the future of this struggle. The White Paper is a historical record of the U.S. imperialism's reactionary policy's disastrous defeat in China, and therefore it is a major contribution to the Chinese people's and the world's people's struggle against imperialism. Acheson said: The Kuomintang's "seemingly powerful strength is weak, and their victory is built on sand." That is completely correct, but it must be added that the "seemingly powerful strength" of the U.S. imperialists themselves and the reactionaries of any country is weak, and the foundation of their temporary rampantness is also "built on sand," or more accurately, built on a volcano. However, the U.S. government has not learned the lessons it should have learned from the China incident. Therefore, the U.S. government will continue to recruit saboteurs of various colors at home and abroad to disrupt the Chinese people's solemn and beautiful motherland, to disrupt the democratic forces of the Soviet Union and the world's people, and to disrupt peace in the East and the West. The first to truly learn the lessons in the China incident is the Chinese people themselves. We believe that our seemingly weak strength is strong, because our strength is rooted in the Chinese people, and also rooted in the internationalist unity of the people of all countries. Since we have overcome the past difficulties witnessed by the 1,054-page White Paper, we must also overcome any difficulties that any new White Paper will threaten. Any White Paper from the U.S. imperialist government will only helplessly pronounce its own failure and helplessly confirm the victory of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of all countries.

    无可奈何的供状
    评美国关于中国问题的白皮书
    美国国务院在本月五日发表的名为“中美关系”的冗长的白皮书和其他有关的资料，其主要内容现在已经为中国人民所知。从美国政府的白皮书和美国国务卿艾奇逊的声明中，中国人民应该得到什么教训呢？
    应该得到的第一个和最基本的教训，就是美国帝国主义政府对于中国民族利益和中国人民民主力量的根深蒂固的敌视。美国白皮书毫不掩饰美国政府的帝国主义的侵略立场。美国政府公然厚颜的宣称“不干涉中国内政”是不可能的，因为它与“支持中国的统一与领土完整”“发生了冲突”。换句话说，美国政府认为必须干涉中国内政，必须把中国看作美国的保护国，然后中国才能有所谓“统一与领土完整”！根据这种希特勒主义的武断，美国政府尽管承认蒋介石的国民党是一群“与过去军阀并无区别的反动分子”，因而他们的政府“已经失去人民的支持”，但是“为了显见的理由，仍旧继续倾全力援助”它，使它“尽可能在中国广大的地区上建立其权威”。究竟是“为了什么显见的理由”呢？美国政府给予这个反动的不受人民支持的政府以“较美国对其他任何国家的援助数量为大”的援助，等于这个反动政府的“金钱支出的百分之五十以上”，究竟是为了什么呢？美国政府究竟是为着什么奥妙的“友谊的”目的，“在运输武装和补给上”给予一个反动的而且本身已经“丧失了斗志”的军队以如此巨大的援助，供给了它的“军需品的大部分”，致使其竟能一度用战争的方法（记着：这在美国政府就叫做“鼓励双方从事协商，力求避免内战的发生”！）“推广其控制及于华北和东北的大部分”呢？凡是一个头脑清醒而有最低限度的推理能力的人，都不能不由此得到结论：美国政府是坚决地一贯地抱着侵略中国的目的。美国政府之所以看来毫无理由地援助一个不受人民支持的反动政府及其反动军队，来进攻中国的拒绝支持反动统治的广大人民，是有一个不可告人的“理由”的，这个“理由”就是：美国政府的侵略政策既然违反中国人民的意志和中国民族的权益，美国政府就不可能指望得到中国人民的合作，就不可能不专横地干涉中国内政，以便用军事方法在中国建立一个可以与美国政府“合作”的季里诺式的卖国傀儡政府。难道除此以外，还有任何别的解释吗？
    白皮书徒然地伪善地说了一大堆中美的友谊。这种友谊确是存在的，而且将永远继续存在，但是它只存在在美国人民和中国人民之间，因为美国人民没有侵略中国的动机和必要，并且曾在许多方面与中国人民作了令人永志不忘的互相援助。至于美国政府的侵略行为，甚至艾奇逊也不能不承认这是美国人民所“显然不会允许”的。艾奇逊在致杜鲁门的信中写道：美国今天如果采取进一步的干涉，则“势将引起中国民众的愤慨，并将受到美国人民的谴责”。多奇怪！如果美国政府对于中国人民确是抱着友好态度，为什么扩大这种友谊的范围和广度（比方说，如果美国政府曾在抗日战争期间援助中国人民而不是援助中国人民所反对的恶政府），就会引起这种友谊的一方的愤慨和他方的谴责呢？难道这还不足以证明，美国政府所抱的并不是什么友谊，而只是令人愤慨和必须谴责的侵略野心吗？既然如此，难道规定了这种侵略野心的范围和广度（比方说，日本侵略者不占领延安和重庆而停止在黄河东岸和贵州南部），就会叫人们停止愤慨和谴责了吗？美国帝国主义分子们妄想全世界都是愚蠢的，但是结果表明，真正愚蠢的只是他们自己。
    而事实上美国政府又是怎样规定自己的侵略的范围和广度的呢？帝国主义者按照独占资本的要求所要求的扩张是不知道止境的；如果有什么止境，决不是因为畏惧人们的愤慨和谴责，愤慨和谴责的纪录难道不是已经堆积得比白皮书还要厚吗？这是因为帝国主义者自己的力量有所不能。关于美国政府援助国民党得到什么结果，艾奇逊写道：“我们的援助与鼓励，曾帮助他们抵抗。不幸的但亦无法逃避的事实，是中国内战的不幸结果为美国政府控制所不及。美国在她能力的合理限度之内，所曾经做或能够做的都不能改变这个结果。美国所未做的对于这个结果也没有影响。这是中国内部势力的产物，这些势力，美国亦曾试图加以影响，但不能有效。”看吧！这就是美国的贪得无厌的但是终于失败了的干涉者和侵略者向全世界所作的有益的供状！只有坚决的有效的斗争，将帝国主义者彻底地打败和打倒，帝国主义者的脚步就停止了，而到最后，帝国主义这个厌物就被消灭了。
    但是今天的问题是：干涉者和侵略者在中国是就此干休了吗？不，在这种意义上说，他们的野心仍然是没有止境的。“不到黄河心不死”，这句格言并不能一般地适用于帝国主义者。尽管美国政府对于利用蒋介石国民党这个工具如何失望，但是只要国民党反动派还有一兵一卒或一个特务分子存在，美国政府就决不会中止加以利用。同一个艾奇逊在一个月以前，在七月六日还声明：“美国正向国民党中国输送它现在确能办到的一切经济援助。”但是即令对于国民党的心是死了，美国政府对于继续干涉和侵略中国，继续破坏中国人民解放事业和建设事业的心，却是不会死的。艾奇逊已经明目张胆地宣布：一切反对“中国内部势力”在今日所已经达成的人民民主政治的“发展”，都将受到美国政府的“鼓励”。艾奇逊并在白皮书公布的第二天即八月六日发表专门的声明，提出他的所谓五项原则，如果把这些原则不用骗术而用科学加以解释，那就是：（一）美国政府愿以每一可行之途径，鼓励凡能促中国成为美国殖民地之发展，俾能在国际事务中担任美国帝国主义分子之傀儡的任务。（二）美国政府愿协助中国建立一种经济与政治之环境，可保障美国帝国主义代理人之人权与自由，并可逐步地发展美国的殖民地经济与买办阶级的福利。（三）美国政府反对中国脱离其干涉而独立，反对任何一个不服役于美国独占资本利益之政权。美国政府反对任何外国以平等友好态度援助中国。（四）美国政府将继续与其他殖民于远东的帝国主义国家参照有关各国在整个远东之局势，咨商将有助于各该国在远东继续保持帝国主义特权之办法。（五）美国将强迫联合国达成上述目标，特别是有关维持帝国主义对远东侵略之努力。由此可见，美国政府决定继续从内部破坏人民民主的中国，并从外部压迫人民民主的中国。由此可见，只要美国仍然是帝国主义国家而没有变为人民的国家，美国政府就决意敌视中国人民到底。
    中国人民至今只是努力恢复和保护自己的正当利益，从没有派一个兵或一个顾问，远渡重洋，到美国去干涉该国“内部势力”的发展，去支持该国的“统一与领土完整”，这难道不是明明白白的事实吗？然而美国帝国主义却要在过去、现在和将来干涉中国，破坏中国人民的伟大爱国运动，强迫中国隶属于美国帝国主义，服役于美国帝国主义的利益，这难道不是明明白白的事实吗？因此，美国帝国主义是中国民族与中国人民的不可调和的仇敌，这难道不是明明白白的事实吗？
    因此，中国人民应该从美国白皮书得到的第二个教训，就是中国人民必须继续抵抗和防备敌人美国帝国主义的任何干涉和挑战，必须不堕入敌人美国帝国主义所设的任何陷阱。凡是敌人所害怕的，我们一定要做，凡是敌人所喜欢的，我们一定不要做。美国侵略者号召某些中国人（按照艾奇逊的话，这些人叫做“民主的个人主义者”），组织反共派别，借以推翻共产党领导的人民民主政权。每一个爱国的和自爱的中国人就一定不要这样做，中国人民也一定不允许这样做。美国侵略者妄想在中国人民的经济困难面前利用某种暂时的表面的物质“援助”来勾引中国人民饮鸩止渴，放弃独立，每一个爱国的和自爱的中国人就一定不要这样做，中国人民也一定不允许这样做。美国侵略者妄想挑拨中国人民与苏联的兄弟友谊，借以分化远东和世界的反帝国主义反侵略的同盟，每一个爱国的和自爱的中国人就一定不要这样做，中国人民也一定不允许这样做。
    美国白皮书在美国人民、中国人民、世界人民面前散布了对于中国人民和中国共产党的种种荒谬的恶毒污蔑，例如说中国共产党对于抗日不努力，例如说中国共产党对于抗日战争结束以后的国内和平不努力，例如说中国共产党“为外国帝国主义利益而效力”，与此同时，则竭力冲淡国民党的罪恶，并将美国侵略者在白日梦中所描绘的比国民党有用些的某种新工具称为中国的“民主政治的脊骨”等等。但是这些奇谈简直是幼稚到不值一驳。很久以来，中国共产党与国民党的真相，就已经被许多在中国的美国观察者，包括史迪威将军这样的人物，报告给美国人民了。艾奇逊断言，“在不久的过去，外国之企图控制中国，在中国人民看来，很清楚地就是外来的侵略，因此就遭到严肃的抵抗。”艾奇逊在这里的头脑，似乎还有些清醒之处。但是他接着断言，世界忽然大变了，这些严肃的抵抗者们自己忽然“为外国帝国主义利益而效力”了；过一会儿（大概是一分钟），中国人民又忽然不赞成这种说法，而是“显然地认为具有它的土生性和国家性”了；倒是美国政府所努力帮助其恢复“主权”的国民党，被公认为“为外国帝国主义利益而效力”，而且中国人民老实不客气地指明这个外国帝国主义，首先就是杜鲁门、马歇尔、艾奇逊、司徒雷登之流所代表的美国帝国主义。
    美国帝国主义之企图控制中国，在中国人民看来，很清楚地就是外来的侵略，因此就遭到严肃的抵抗。另一件事也是中国人民很清楚地看到的，这就是苏联并没有干涉中国内政。甚至艾奇逊自己也不能不承认，中国人民解放战争的胜利是“中国内部势力的产物”，而中国内战双方的“军需品的大部分”都是美国供给的。那么，关于谁是侵略者及其代理人的问题，究竟是因失败而昏迷的美国帝国主义分子看得清楚些呢，还是有数十年如一日的爱国立场的四万万七千五百万中国人民看得清楚些？毫无疑问，艾奇逊尽管自己欣赏自己的自相矛盾的天才，却决不能使世界信服，决不能动摇中国人民对于客观真理的坚定信念于万一。
    美国白皮书也攻击了国民党，其目的之一是诱使人们以为美国政府究竟也有一些客观态度。但是白皮书是为什么而攻击国民党的呢？这是侵略者对于他的走狗的攻击，犹如日本侵略者对于汪精卫的攻击。正如艾奇逊所说，攻击了国民党的魏德迈的报告，仍然是“对国民政府的各项问题表示同情”的。同情，但是不满，因为国民党“为外国帝国主义利益而效力”得不好，致使帝国主义援助归于无效，致使帝国主义利益归于灭亡。严格地说，美国侵略者对于国民党的攻击是不公平的，因为第一，国民党的反动无一不因美国政府“援助与鼓励”而加深，没有美国政府的“援助与鼓励”，国民党是不敢惹出这样滔天大祸的；第二，国民党的腐败是随着它的反动而来的，并且这种腐败至少因美国的榜样而加深。广州的国民党报纸在本月十日说得对：“美政府指责中国（国民党）官员贪污舞弊，此为不可否认之事实。但美国派来中国之人员，其贪污程度比诸中国官僚亦无不及。如战后之‘善后救济’事宜及近年之‘经济合作’等工作过程中，美籍人员之贪污舞弊事实诚不可胜数。”螃蟹责备它的儿子横行，沙士比亚喜剧中的丑鬼卡立班痛恨他在镜子里的尊容难看，这就是美国白皮书谴责国民党的真正意义。
    总之，从根本上说来，美国白皮书确是一部颠倒黑白的杰作，这种颠倒黑白如果加以再颠倒，人们是可以从中获得种种有益的教训的。中国人民由美国白皮书进一步认识了美国政府的帝国主义面貌，进一步认识了应该如何向美国帝国主义进行斗争，最后，还可以由此进一步认识这一斗争的前途。白皮书是美国帝国主义反动政策在中国惨败的史册，因此它对于中国人民和世界人民反对帝国主义的斗争是一个重大的贡献。艾奇逊说：国民党的“貌似强大的力量是弱的，他们的胜利建立在沙上”。完全正确，可是必须补充说，美国帝国主义者自己以及任何国家的反动派的“貌似强大的力量”都是弱的，他们的暂时的猖獗的基础也都是“建立在沙上”，或者更准确些说，建立在火山上。但是，美国政府并没有从中国事件中得到应有的教训。因此，美国政府仍然要在中国国内外继续征募各种色彩的破坏分子来捣乱中国人民的庄严美丽的祖国，来捣乱苏联和世界人民的民主力量，来捣乱东方和西方的和平。在中国事变中真正得到了教训的首先是中国人民自己。我们相信我们的曾经貌似弱小的力量是强的，因为我们的力量生根在中国人民中间，同时也生根在各国人民的国际主义团结中间。我们既然战胜了为一千零五十四页的白皮书所见证的过去的困难，我们也必须战胜任何新的白皮书所将要恫吓的困难。美国帝国主义政府的任何白皮书，将只能无可奈何地判决自己的失败，并且无可奈何地证实中国人民和各国革命人民的胜利。
