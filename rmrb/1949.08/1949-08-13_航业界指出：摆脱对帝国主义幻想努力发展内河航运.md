Representatives of the navigation industry pointed out that the six major tasks of the navigation industry in coordination with the government's call should include assisting the relocation of factories and schools inland, strengthening inland waterway transportation, and promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. They also pointed out that it is completely wrong for a small number of people with vague consciousness to still not be able to completely get rid of illusions about imperialism. Seafarer representative Han Zemin said: The government's call is completely correct and necessary. No matter what difficulties there are in shipping in the future, no matter where the new routes are, we will definitely follow and complete the task of developing inland waterway transportation and promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. Shen Rixin, manager of Cuncheng Qianzhuang, and others advocated implementing funds to the countryside to develop the rural economy to assist in the recovery and development of industrial production. Youth representative Zhu Liang felt that after attending the conference, he understood the policy of overcoming today's difficulties, opposing the enemy's blockade, and building a new Shanghai. He said: We are prepared to handle the tuition fee issue for the next semester in accordance with the spirit of overcoming difficulties, taking care of all parties, and overcoming difficulties together. At the same time, we will make full ideological preparations for school relocation, streamlining departments, and going to the countryside. Student representative Yang Wenyuan expressed that he would assist in the relocation of some schools inland and mobilize students to work in the countryside. A person in charge of the Democratic Women's Federation said: The women's federation will soon convene a meeting of women representatives who attended the conference to discuss how to convey the spirit and report of the conference to various women's organizations, implement it into concrete work, and arrange work more specifically in accordance with the six major tasks. The literary and art circles are conducting in-depth research and arrangement of work in various aspects to further cooperate with and implement the six major tasks. Mr. Feng Xuefeng, who had just returned to Shanghai from Beiping, said: I feel that the great struggle to overcome new difficulties after the liberation of Shanghai has begun. The people of Shanghai should have the highest degree of unity, even more than dealing with any previous struggle, and conduct the struggle under the correct leadership of the Communist Party, under an overall plan and unified steps. Writer Mei Lin proposed: In addition to using our pens and mouths to cooperate with the progress of various tasks, we will participate in various practical work. The old painter Feng Zikai said: Although Shanghai has had so many electric lights and neon lights in the past few decades, it has actually been in the dark all the time. The success of this conference of representatives from all walks of life marks the beginning of light. This light will increase and become greater due to the joint efforts of the people, and in the future it will truly become a "city that never sleeps." Mr. Chen Yanqiao said: In order to carry out the six major tasks, we must depict the bloated shape of old Shanghai and the healthy vision of new Shanghai. We must paint for the workers, for the peasants, for the broad masses of the people, and use our colored pencils and carving knives to complete the six major tasks.

The urban garrison troops held party member meetings and model worker symposiums on the 7th to study how to turn the spirit of the representative conference into practical action. At the symposium of meritorious models of the Ninth Company of a certain regiment, Han Faxiang, the squad leader of the all-around model - "Iron Hammer Squad," said: "The people of all circles in Shanghai have stated that wherever the People's Liberation Army fights, they will support it. We should respond to the people by quickly liberating all of China and crushing the enemy's blockade. In the current garrison mission, we should be more vigilant, and we would rather be more tired so that the people of Shanghai will not suffer any losses!" Comrade Ge Qun of the "Pearl River" troops who attended the Shanghai All-Circles Representatives Conference conveyed the reports of the Shanghai All-Circles Representatives Conference and Commissar Rao and Mayor Chen to the hero assembly on the afternoon of the 7th. The heroes unanimously expressed their determination to strive to fulfill the six major tasks and the three major demands of the people.

    航业界指出：摆脱对帝国主义幻想努力发展内河航运
    航业界代表钟山道认为航业界配合政府号召的六大任务，应该协助工厂学校内迁，并加强内河航运，促进城乡物资交流。同时指出：现在少数意识模糊的人，还不能完全摆脱对帝国主义的幻想，是完全错误的。海员代表韩泽民说：政府的号召，是完全正确和必需的，今后不管航运上有什么困难，不管新的航线在什么地方，我们一定跟着去，而且一定要完成发展内河航运和促进城乡物资交流的任务。存诚钱庄经理沈日新等主张实行资金下乡，发展农村经济，以协助恢复与发展工业生产。青年界代表朱良觉得参加大会以后，认识了克服今天的困难，及反对敌人封锁建设新上海的方针。他说：我们对下学期的学费问题就准备根据克服困难照顾各方共渡难关的精神处理。同时对迁校，精简院系，下乡等在思想上作充分的准备。学生界代表仰文渊表示要协助部分学校内迁，动员同学下乡工作。民主妇联某负责人说：妇女界即将召开参加会议的妇女代表会议，讨论如何将大会精神与报告，传达到各个妇女团体，贯彻到具体工作中去，并根据六大任务更具体的布置工作。文艺界正在从各方面深入研究布置进一步配合与执行六大任务的工作。刚从北平返沪的冯雪峰先生说：我觉得：上海解放后战胜新的困难的伟大斗争已经开始了。上海人民应比对付任何一次的斗争都更需要最高度的团结，更需要在共产党的正确领导之下，在全盘的计划和一致的步骤之下，进行斗争。文学家梅林先生提出：我们除用笔和口配合各种工作的进行外，将参加各种实际工作。老画家丰子恺先生说：上海在过去数十年间，虽然电灯和霓虹灯这么多，其实一直在黑暗中。此次各界代表会议成功，开始有了光明。这光明将因了人民的合力奋斗而越增越大，将来真个成为“不夜之城”。陈烟桥先生说：为了执行六大任务，我们要刻画出旧上海臃肿的形状，新上海健康的远景。我们要为工人画，为农民画，为广大的人民画，为完成六大任务使用我们的彩笔和刻刀。
    市区警备部队于七日纷纷召开党员大会、英模座谈会，研究如何将代表大会的精神变为实际行动。在某团九连的功臣模范座谈会上，全面模范——“铁锤子班”班长韩发祥同志说：“上海各界人民表示解放军打到哪里，他们支援到哪里，我们就应该用迅速解放全中国，粉碎敌人封锁来回答人民。在目前警备任务中应提高警惕，宁可我们多疲劳些，也不叫上海人民遭受一点损失！”“珠江”部队出席上海各界代表会议的葛群同志，于七日下午向群英大会传达上海各界代表会议与饶政委、陈市长报告。英模们一致表示为完成六大任务与人民三大要求而奋斗。
