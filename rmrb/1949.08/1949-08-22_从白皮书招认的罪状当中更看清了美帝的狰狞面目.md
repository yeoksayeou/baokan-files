　　Seeing the Ugly Face of American Imperialism More Clearly From the Crimes Admitted in the White Paper
　　Beijing University Student Union
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The "White Paper on Sino-American Relations" published by the U.S. State Department on the 5th of this month is a confession of American imperialism's aggression against China, its assistance to the Kuomintang bandit gang, and its opposition to and destruction of the democratic forces of the Chinese people. We, the students of Peking University, pointed out the aggressive nature of the American government and the various crimes it committed against the Chinese people in previous anti-American Chiang student movements, together with students from other schools. From this confession of crimes by American imperialism itself, we have further deepened our understanding of the evil system of imperialism and further seen the ugly face of American imperialism. Today, under the hammering of the great power of the Chinese people, the Kuomintang bandit gang has been shamefully defeated, and the reactionary policy of American imperialism in China has also been shamefully defeated. However, they will never give up. The White Paper is a "helpless confession," and at the same time, a vicious conspiracy. It confesses that American imperialism will use so-called "democratic individualist elements" to split the Chinese revolutionary camp and will use various means to undermine the friendship between the Chinese people and the Soviet Union. We students were not fooled by American imperialism in the past, and we can see it even more clearly today. We believe that the people of China can only be thoroughly liberated and establish a truly peaceful, democratic, unified, and prosperous new China by uniting more strongly and closely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, and by resolutely standing on the side of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. We students will stand at our posts and resolutely fight to the end with the people of the whole country.

　　从白皮书招认的罪状当中更看清了美帝的狰狞面目
    北大学生会
    【本报讯】北大学生会斥责美帝白皮书文如下：本月五日，美国国务院发表的名为“中美关系”的白皮书，是美帝国主义侵略中国，协助国民党匪帮，反对与破坏中国人民民主力量的供状。我们北大同学早在解放前，就在历次反美蒋学生运动之中，与其他各校的同学一起，指出美国政府的侵略本质及其对中国人民所犯的各种罪行事实。从美帝国主义这一自己所招认的罪状当中，使我们更进一步加深对帝国主义罪恶制度的了解，更进一步的看到了美帝国主义的狰狞面目。今天，在中国人民伟大力量的锤击之下，国民党匪帮是可耻的失败了，美帝国主义在中国的反动政策亦可耻的失败了。然而，他们决不会就此干休的。白皮书是一个“无可奈何的供状”，同时又是一个恶毒的阴谋。它供出美帝国主义将利用所谓“民主个人主义分子”来分裂中国革命阵营，并将用各种各样的方式来破坏中国人民与苏联的友谊。我们同学在以前没有上美帝国主义的当，今天更看得清清楚楚。我们相信全中国的人民只有更坚强更紧密地团结起来，在中国共产党的领导之下，在中国人民领袖毛主席的领导之下，坚决的站在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营一边进行奋斗，才能得到彻底的解放，建立真正和平、民主、统一与富强的新中国。我们同学将站在自己的岗位上，与全国人民一起坚决奋斗到底。
