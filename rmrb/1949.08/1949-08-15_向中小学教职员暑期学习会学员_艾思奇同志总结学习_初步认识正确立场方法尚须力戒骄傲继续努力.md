    To the Trainees of the Summer Study Session for Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff
    Comrade Ai Siqi Summarizes Learning
    Preliminary Understanding of Correct Standpoint and Method Requires Overcoming Pride and Continuing Efforts

    [Our Newspaper] Comrade Ai Siqi gave a summary report on the one-month study to all the trainees of the summer study session for primary and secondary school teachers and staff at 4 pm on the 13th. The report pointed out the gains and shortcomings of this study, and explained several issues that everyone still did not understand deeply. He said that the gains from this study were very great. First, everyone had a preliminary understanding of the basic standpoints and viewpoints of Marxism, understood that labor creates the world and the concept of class struggle, and used actions to understand these two viewpoints. This is the greatest gain. Secondly, everyone learned new learning methods, which is the method of ideological transformation, namely the method of criticism and self-criticism. Most people can initially apply it. The reason why everyone has these gains is mainly due to everyone's active and enthusiastic learning and their conscious desire to master new things. At the same time, it cannot be ignored that it is due to the changes of the times. Now it is the era of the proletariat, which makes everyone eager to learn. Comrade Ai Siqi reminded everyone: Judging by the time, one month, our learning achievements are great, but in terms of future application, it is only "the first step in the Long March." Therefore, everyone still cannot be proud, and should not think that after learning Marxism-Leninism this time, it can be inexhaustible. It is necessary to make great efforts to continue learning. Secondly, he also talked about several issues that have not been completely resolved, such as the labor point of view, class analysis, and so on. It was not until about 8 pm that everyone dispersed in the drizzling rain.

    向中小学教职员暑期学习会学员
    艾思奇同志总结学习
    初步认识正确立场方法尚须力戒骄傲继续努力
    【本报讯】中小学教职员暑期学习会，十三日下午四时全体学员听取艾思奇同志关于一月来的学习总结报告。报告指出了此次学习的收获与缺点；并对大家理解得仍不深刻的几个问题加以解释。他说，这次学习的收获是很大的，第一，对于马克思主义的基本立场、观点已经有了初步认识，认识了劳动创造世界，阶级斗争，并且用行动来理解这两个观点，这是一个最大的收获。其次学习了新的学习方法，这就是思想改造的方法，即是批评与自我批评的方法，大多数人都能初步地运用起来。能有这些收获的原因，主要是由于大家积极热心学习，自觉的要掌握新东西；但同时，不可忽略的是由于时代的变化，现在是无产阶级的时代，使大家急于要求学习。艾思奇同志提醒大家说道：按时间一个月来讲，我们的学习成绩是很大的，但按将来运用来说，却才是“万里长征中的第一步”。因此大家仍不能骄傲，不要以为这次学了马列主义，从此就可受用不尽，还要用很大力量努力继续学习。其次，他又谈到几个尚未彻底解决的问题。如劳动观点、阶级分析等等。直到晚八时许，大家才在细雨蒙蒙中散会。
