　　Datong Coal Mine's Rebirth
    Report from our Ping-Sui Railway Line Reporting Team, Xiao Ying

　　A Ruined Mine
    The Datong Coalfield lies within the six counties of Datong, Shuoxian, Pinglu, Youyu, Zuoyun, and Huairen in northern Shanxi. According to a 1943 Japanese survey, the total mining area covers 2,200 square kilometers, with reserves exceeding 30 to 40 billion tons. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the highest production was in 1936, with 265,000 tons of coal. After the occupation, Japanese warlords and capitalists, in order to plunder as much as possible, established the "Datong Coal Mine Company" in 1940, setting up power plants, merging old mines, and opening new shafts. They built eight major mines near Kouquan Town, 40 miles west of Datong, mostly using electric power for extraction. In 1941, coal production reached 2,517,419 tons, with a daily peak of 13,718 tons. Subsequently, due to the Japanese invaders' losing battles, production decreased year by year. By July 1945, the average daily coal output was 4,630 tons. After Japan surrendered, the Chiang Kai-shek/Yan Xishan bandits helped each other to rob and plunder, engaging in corruption, theft, and destruction of production. Later, they launched a counter-revolutionary civil war, causing the mine equipment to be damaged by the war in 1946. Over the next two years, under the rule of the Yan Xishan bandits, the destruction became even more severe. Machines were dismantled and sold as scrap iron, and houses were torn down for timber. By the time of liberation in February this year, the mines were littered with scrap iron and broken tiles, overgrown with weeds and thorns.

    Restoring Production
    After the coal mine was liberated in February, the People's Government immediately organized miners to restore production. However, due to inconvenient transportation and difficulties in sales, production could not be expanded. After Datong was liberated in May and the Ping-Sui Railway was opened to traffic, this problem was solved. On the evening of May 9th, when the workers heard that the People's Liberation Army was going to use trains to transport coal, they were so happy that they repaired the railway overnight. Furthermore, because a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army needed 300 tons of coal the next day, more than 600 miners at Meiyukou worked from 6:00 PM on the 9th to 12:00 AM on the 10th, squeezing out more than 600 tons in one go. They said, "The People's Liberation Army saved us. How could we not complete this task of supporting the front!" Meiyukou was the only mine that remained operational under the Yan Xishan bandit rule, producing only a little over 100 tons of coal a day. After liberation, the number of workers increased day by day. The Yongdingzhuang and Tongziliang mines also started operating after liberation, all using indigenous methods of mining. Currently, the machine factory alone has more than 1,400 workers. Coal production was 4,139 tons in April, 8,203 tons in May, and 9,440 tons in June, despite some miners who had not yet separated from agricultural production returning home to till the land due to the busy farming season.

    Machine Mining
    The coal mine takeover team made the restoration of machine mining the focus of its work in June, starting to repair houses, sort out scattered equipment, and prepare to establish a machine factory. In mid-June, they moved 24 machines from the city, including washing beds, planers, drills, and lathes, for manufacturing machinery. The workers installed them in the newly built simple workshops and immediately began repairing machine parts. They contributed tools they had collected for many years, found raw materials from scrap iron piles, and the six iron furnaces burned red-hot, forging mining tools. The sand-turning team even cast copper tiles for the mine shaft headframe and many machine parts. First, the 60-horsepower steam engine was revived, providing power to the machine factory. A 15-horsepower small generator also sent out electricity, so there was no longer a need to turn the machines manually, as the mechanics had been doing in such a hurry in recent days. When the steam whistle, silent for many years, filled the valley again, the sound of hammers repairing the coal-pushing iron carts became even louder, and the miners' coal-stained faces revealed inner joy. Everywhere was full of vitality.

    The Yongdingzhuang No. 1 shaft steam headframe has been mostly repaired, and the bottom roadway is also being tidied up, in order to resume production on "August 1st" to commemorate Army Day.

    From Slaves to Masters
    Under Japanese rule, the miners were slaves. Most of them were captured from various places by the Japanese army, and under the compulsion of bayonets, they worked 12 hours a day, receiving two sorghum buns and sleeping 70 to 80 people on one large kang. A miner from Henan Province said painfully, "We were captured by the Japanese, more than 30 of us in total. Some died from exhaustion, some were beaten to death, some starved to death... Now, only three of us are left." Under Yan Xishan bandit rule, they were still slaves, and were subject to layer upon layer of exploitation by large and small contractors. Wages were deducted, and they did not have the freedom to buy things. The food sold to the workers on credit was more expensive than the market price, and they even used the Japanese's old policy of poisoning the people, selling drugs to the workers. As a result, at the end of the month, the coal carriers had no money left. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the workers organized their own trade union and led everyone in a struggle against the "Renhuogui" (labor contractors) who carried out feudal exploitation. At the end of May, under the pressure of the masses, the eight labor contractors successively returned 3,200 jin of millet that had been illegally deducted after liberation, and returned the workers' production tools. The workers voluntarily formed a cooperative production organization - the Luoquan Ban. Another part implemented a piece-rate wage system. Now the highest daily wage for miners carrying coal can be converted to 21 jin of rice. The cooperative also supplies workers with some daily necessities and food at lower than market prices, ensuring the livelihood of workers and their families.

    They began to have a preliminary class consciousness. At the Workers' Representative Conference at the end of May, the Meiyukou No. 3 shaft proposed a plan to restore daily production to more than 200 tons. The Yongdingzhuang worker representatives actively suggested to the leaders that they hoped to use manpower more systematically in the restoration work, and pointed out some past wasteful phenomena. The Meiyukou Workers' Picket Team was established, and the machine factory organized a study class. On "July 1st", they happily danced the Yangko dance to celebrate their Party's birthday. They have initially realized the true meaning of the phrase "The workers are the masters of the factory."

    A Glorious Future
    The Datong Coalfield not only has astonishingly large reserves, but also has particularly good quality. The upper Jurassic coal, with 10 billion tons, is non-caking or weakly caking coal, containing only about 3% ash and only 0.37% sulfur, with a high calorific value of up to 7,700 calories. It is the best fuel coal, and can also be mixed with coal produced by the Jingxing Coal Mine for coking, reducing the ash content of the coke, making it the best coke for steelmaking. The lower Lower Permian coal is a strong caking coal, containing very little sulfur, phosphorus and ash, and can be directly supplied for making coke for iron smelting. Datong's coal, plus Xuanhua's iron, will become a powerful pillar for the development of China's heavy industry. If the small coal produced in the mine is used for power generation at the same time, this place can also become a source of industrial power for North China. What the coalfield urgently needs now is a large-scale, unified restoration and construction plan, mobilizing a large amount of manpower and material resources to develop it. The Enterprise Department of the North China Government has already started to do so. The Pingming Power Plant will be able to generate 1,050 kilowatts of electricity by the end of this year to supply the mine. The Datong Coal Mine has a glorious future.

　　大同煤矿的新生

　　残破的矿场
    大同煤田在晋北大同、朔县、平鲁、右玉、左云、怀仁六县间。据一九四三年日人调查，全矿面积二千二百平方公里，埋藏量达三百到四百亿吨以上。抗战前，产量最高的是一九三六年，出煤二十六万五千吨。沦陷后，日本军阀及资本家为尽量掠夺，一九四○年成立了“大同炭矿公司”，设立电厂，并吞旧矿，开掘新井。先后在大同以西四十里口泉镇附近建八大矿，大部用电力开采。一九四一年出煤二百五十一万七千四百一十九吨，日产最高纪录到过一万三千七百一十八吨。随后由于日寇侵略战事失利，产量逐年减少，到一九四五年七月，平均每日出煤四千六百三十吨。日本投降后，蒋阎匪帮你抢我夺，贪污盗卖，破坏生产；以后又发动了反人民内战，使矿山设备在一九四六年受到战火毁坏；加上以后两年多，在阎匪统治下，被破坏得更加厉害了，机器拆了当废铁卖，房屋拆了要木料。今年二月解放时，各矿已遍地烂铁碎瓦，生满蓬蒿荆棘了。
    恢复生产
    二月煤矿解放，人民政府立即组织矿工，恢复生产。但因交通不便，销路困难，生产无法扩大。五月大同解放，平绥路通车，这一问题解决了。当五月九号晚上，工人听到解放军要用火车来运煤时，都高兴的连夜修铁道。又因为解放军某部次日需要煤三百吨，煤峪口六百多矿工，从九号下午六点钟工作到十号十二点，一鼓劲挤出六百多吨。他们说：“解放军救了俺们，这点支援前线任务，俺们还能不完成！”煤峪口是阎匪统治时唯一开工的矿，一天也不过产煤一百多吨。解放后工人一天天的增加。永定庄、同字梁两矿场也在解放后开工，都是用土法开采。目前连机器厂已有一千四百多工人，四月份共产煤四千一百三十九吨，五月份产八千二百零三吨，六月份虽因农忙，曾有一部分未脱离农业生产的矿工回家锄地，但仍出煤九千四百四十吨。
    机器开采
    煤矿接管组把恢复机器开采作为六月份工作重点，开始修葺房屋，整理零散器材，预备建立机器厂。中旬从城内搬来二十四部洗床、刨床、钻床、元车等制造机器的机器。工人们把它们装置在新修的简陋工房里，立刻就开始修配机件。他们献出收藏多年的工具，从废铁堆里找出原料，六盘铁炉也燃起通红的炉火，炼造着矿山用具，翻沙组更铸出矿井高车用的铜瓦和许多机器零件。首先，六十匹马力的蒸气机复活了，供给机器厂动力。一部十五匹马力的小发电机也送出电来，再也不会象前些日子用人力转动机器时，急得机工用手搬转轮了。当哑了多年的气笛声重又充溢山谷时，修理推煤铁车的锤声更加响亮了，矿工们煤污的脸上透露出内心的欢笑。到处充满了生气。
    永定庄一号井蒸气高车已经大部修好，井底巷道也在整理，在“八一”恢复生产，以纪念红军节。
    奴隶变主人
    日寇统治时，矿工是奴隶。他们大部分是被日军从各地抓来的，在枪刺逼迫下，一天做工十二小时，发两个高粱窝窝头，七八十人挤在一个大炕上睡。一个河南籍的矿工痛心地说：“我们被鬼子一共抓来卅多个，有的累死了，有的被打死了，有的饿死了……到现在连我只剩下三个人。”阎匪统治时他们仍然是奴隶，且受着大小包工的层层剥削，工资被克扣，买东西也不自由。赊给工人们的吃食比市价还高，甚至还利用日寇那套毒化政策，卖毒品给工人吸。结果，到月底算来算去就没有“背煤人”的钱了。解放后，工人在共产党领导下组织起自己的工会，领导大家向进行封建剥削的“人伙柜”斗争。五月底，八家柜主在群众的压制下，先后退还了解放后非法克扣的小米三千二百斤，交还工人生产工具，工人们自愿结合成一种合作性质的生产组织——罗圈班。另一部分是实行计件实物工资制。现在矿工背煤一日最高工资可折合米二十一斤。合作社更低于市价供给工人部分日用品和食粮，保证了工人和家属的生活。
    他们开始有了初步的阶级觉悟，在五月底职工代表会上，煤峪口三号井提出了恢复日产二百多吨的计划。永定庄工人代表更积极向领导上建议，希望在恢复工作中能更有计划地使用人力，并指出过去的某些浪费现象。煤峪口成立了工人纠察队，机器厂组织起学习班。“七一”快乐的扭着秧歌，庆祝自己的党的生日。他们已初步体会到“工人是工厂的主人”这句话的真谛。
    辉煌的未来
    大同煤田不但埋藏量大得惊人，品质也特别好：上层侏罗纪煤炭一百亿吨是非黏结性或微黏结性煤，含灰分仅百分之三左右，硫磺仅含百分之○·三七，发热量高到七千七百卡，是最优良的燃料用煤，又可与井陉煤矿产煤混合炼焦，使焦炭灰分减少，成为最优良的炼钢用焦。下层二垒纪煤炭是强黏结性炭，含硫、磷及灰分都很少，可直接供炼制冶铁用焦炭。大同的煤加上宣化的铁，将成为中国发展重工业的一个有力支柱。如果同时利用矿上出产的碎煤发电，又可使此地成为华北工业动力的一个泉源。现在煤田所急需的是一个大规模的统一的恢复建设计划，动员大量人力物力来开发。华北政府企业部已经着手在作了，平明发电厂今年年底就可以发电一千零五十千瓦供给矿山。大同煤矿有着辉煌的未来。
