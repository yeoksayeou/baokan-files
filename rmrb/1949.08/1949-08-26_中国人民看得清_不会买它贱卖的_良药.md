The Chinese People Can See Clearly
　　Will Not Buy the Cheaply Sold "Good Medicine"
　　Xiao Bao
　　"Non-interference in China's internal affairs" is impossible! Acheson confessed this today with resignation. Ever since Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the Chinese revolution, they have sometimes secretly and sometimes blatantly colluded with American imperialism, selling out China. From that time on, American imperialism has been openly or secretly interfering in China's internal affairs at all times and in all places. At the time, it did indeed paralyze some "kind" "democratic individualists," but the cruel facts exposed the imperialists' conspiracy. The Chinese people are awakening day by day, realizing that so-called "relief supplies" and so-called "mediation" are all tricks played by the invaders. The Chinese people rejected this "aid" and launched an even more fervent anti-American imperialist movement. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people were not deceived by these "false appearances" and clearly recognized the aggressive nature of American imperialism.
　　Now they are openly and loudly roaring that they "want to interfere in China's internal affairs" and enslave the Chinese people. This has educated a batch of "democratic individualists."
　　Of course, there may still be some people with illusions that even they themselves find vague: to establish a so-called "opposition party" in the "people's democratic" camp, that is, to establish a counter-revolutionary group in the revolutionary camp. However, this earth-shattering change has educated the broad masses of the Chinese people, and even if one day someone acts as an echo of the American imperialists, the Chinese people will not buy their cheaply sold "good medicine."

　　中国人民看得清
  　不会买它贱卖的“良药”
    萧保
    “不干涉中国内政”是不可能的！艾奇逊今天在无可奈何的情况下坦白出来了。自从蒋介石叛变中国革命的那一天起，他们便有时偷偷地有时明目张胆地与美帝相勾结，出卖着中国。从那时起，美帝也就无时无地不是在公开地或偷偷地干涉着中国内政。当时也的确麻痹过一些“善良”的“民主个人主义者”，但是残酷的事实暴露了帝国主义者的阴谋，中国人民一天天地觉醒起来了，认识到所谓“救济品”，所谓“调解”都是侵略者在玩把戏。中国人民拒绝这些“援助”。更热炽地开展了反美帝的运动。中国人民在中国共产党领导下没有被这些“伪象”所迷惑，清楚地认识到了美帝的侵略本质。
    现在他们公开地大声咆哮着“要干涉中国内政”，要奴役中国人民。这都教育了一批“民主的个人主义者”。
    固然，也许还有人存在着一些连他们自己也感到渺茫的幻想：在“人民民主”阵营中建立所谓“反对派”，也就是在革命阵营中建立反革命的集团。但是这翻天覆地的大变革，已教育了广大的中国人民，即使有一天有人作美帝国主义者的应声虫，中国人民也不会买他们所贱卖的“良药”的。
