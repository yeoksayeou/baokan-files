　　The Companion
    By Panova
    (Written by Soviet Panova, translated by Su Ling, proofread by Cao Jinghua)
　　Part One: Night
    Chapter One: Danilov
    Kratsov and Prodasov were silent, their faces gloomy. Nivitsky said with a hesitant expression:
    "No, we should go to sleep."
    "Then let's go," said Danilov.
    Nivitsky walked with him in the car, anxiously awaiting reprimands. Danilov didn't speak or look back at him. He opened the door – Nivitsky closed it. The rattling of the wheels echoed in the corridor. The real night had enveloped the world, the sky was full of stars, and morning was almost upon them.
    Mu Hengna was in the medicine car, drowsily gasping for breath, with a cover on the shower head.
    "Look at the trick she came up with," Danilov said to Nivitsky. "How comfortably she has arranged it. Don't rush, she's making this a blue and pink place... Listen! I'm going to install a radio here. When the wounded come to be bandaged, they can sit here and listen. Can you do that?"
    "Yes," Nivitsky mumbled.
    Danilov sized him up. This young man had the air of an intellectual, dressed neatly, and one could tell he was used to wearing good clothes.
    "What's wrong with you?" he asked. "Why weren't you called up for military service?"
    "Hemorrhoids," Nivitsky replied, his face red.
    Danilov was surprised.
    "Look at you, getting such an old man's disease! But do you really want to join the army?"
    "I worked on the Moscow-Vladivostok train for six years," Nivitsky said excitedly. "I could have stayed there and continued working; no one would have interfered with me. But I asked to come to the ambulance car myself, wanting to contribute a little..."
    "But the discipline in the ambulance car is no looser than in the army," Danilov said. "I'll even tell you this: what is permissible for those at the front is not permissible for us. We should be angels. We should be holy angels. We are male and female nurses... Alcohol, that disgusting thing," he said in a low, agitated voice, clenching his fist, "I guarantee you, such things would be eliminated immediately on the train."
    It had been less than two weeks since the start of the war, but it felt like years had passed.
    On the morning of June 22nd, Danilov woke up too late and got angry at his wife: why didn't she wake him up?
    "Danilov, the war has broken out, Molotov broadcast it..."
    He ran into the room. The radio broadcast was over; there was no doubt. The radio was silent. Danilov raised his head. Everything had changed. Even the sun's glow had changed. His house was different too. His wife's face was different. That peaceful and tranquil time had flown by like a lifetime ago. Everything was flying by like water, along with his thoughts.
    "Dad, are we still going? Are we?" his son asked.
    His son was four years old at the time.
    "We're not going," Danilov replied, and his son started to cry...
    Danilov spent the day going through his letters, writing a letter to his father, and sending some money to the old man at the post office.
    Among many old letters, there was a crumpled envelope with the corner of a photograph peeking out from inside – he didn't take the photo out, he threw it to the bottom of the drawer without looking at it.
    He put his son's photo in his wallet.
    At night, his wife sobbed, crying softly, afraid to disturb him. He pretended to be asleep.
    She noticed him moving, and sat up, looking down at his face:
    "But you can be exempted from military service, Danilov?"
    He turned over. When the radio broadcast in the morning, the matter was decided. Tomorrow he would go to the mobilization department. As for her—her affairs were small, she was an insignificant person.
    In the morning, he received a notice. This was better. This way no one would say he was floating to the surface. He was being mobilized.
    The mobilization department sent him to Potapenko. Potapenko was a familiar friend, the director of a sanatorium. He sat at his desk, wearing a uniform, with a shaved head, looking younger, surrounded by people in civilian clothes. Although these people were all new, and although the windows were all open, the room was so smoky that it was hard to breathe.
    Potapenko extended a warm, swollen hand to Danilov.
    "Ah, you've come. Have you come to request an exemption?"
    "No."
    "Alright, you wait a while," Potapenko said.
    Actually, there was no need for Danilov to wait so long; Potapenko even received those who came later ahead of schedule—Danilov understood: Potapenko wanted to show off in front of him. He felt quite pleased that Danilov was still waiting in civilian clothes, while he was already wearing a uniform, and people were coming to him to receive appointments and orders. Potapenko's double-chinned, freshly shaven face radiated pride. He frowned his white eyebrows, trying to hide that radiance, but to no avail. Finally, he called Danilov in.
    "Sit down," Potapenko said. "Have you served in the military?"
    "Yes."
    "Alright," Potapenko said, writing in his notebook. "You'll serve as a political commissar on an ambulance train. Don't rush," he said, anticipating Danilov's objection. "I know what you're going to say. But you have to go to the ambulance train. Do you know how to organize a train?"
    "No. Do you?"
    "I don't know either," Potapenko said. "It's a difficult matter, Danilov."
    "It's a difficult matter," Danilov agreed.

Note: Exemption from military service—Those who are disabled or experts with special missions may be exempt from military service. (To be continued)

    潘诺瓦
    （苏联潘诺瓦著苏龄译曹靖华校）
　　第一部　夜
    第一章　达尼洛夫
    克拉错夫和普洛达梭夫苦丧着脸沉默着。尼威茨基带着犹豫不定的神情说：
    “不，应当去睡觉了。”
    “那么，咱们去吧，”达尼洛夫说着。
    尼威茨基跟他在车里走着，愁闷的等待着叱责。达尼洛夫不作声，也不回头看他。他开了门——尼威茨基把门关起来。车轮的轧轧声，在走廊里响着。已经是真正的夜幕把世界罩起来了，天空里满布着繁星，马上就到早晨了。
    穆恒娜在药车里，睡眼蒙＠的喘息着，套着淋浴喷头上的罩子。
    “你瞧瞧她想出的把戏，”达尼洛夫对尼威茨基说。“她布置得多么舒适呵。别忙，她把这儿作一个蓝色的和粉红色的……你听着吧！我要在这儿装一个无线电收音机。伤兵来裹伤的时候，坐到这儿就可以听。你能作吗？”
    “能，”尼威茨基咕哝着。
    达尼洛夫把他上下打量了一番。这少年，有一付知识分子的仪容，衣服穿得很干净，一看就晓得他是惯于穿好衣服的人。
    “你怎么回事？”他问道。“为什么没有叫你从军？”
    “痔疮。”尼威茨基面色通红的回答着。
    达尼洛夫惊奇起来。
    “你瞧，你得了这样老年人的疾病呵！可是你真的愿意去从军吗？”
    “我在莫斯科——海参崴的列车上干过六年事，”尼威茨基兴奋的说。“我本可以留在那儿继续干的，没有人会干涉过我。可是我自己请求到救护车上来的，想多少效一点劳……”
    “可是救护车上的纪律，并不比军队里松呵，”达尼洛夫说着。“我甚至对你这样说：对前线上的人所容许的，对我们就不行。我们应该作天使。应该作圣洁的天使。我们是男女护士………酒，这讨厌的东西，”他握着拳头，激动的低声说，“我对你担保，火车上立刻就把这种东西扩清了。”
    自从开战到现在，还不到两星期，可是却觉得好象已经过了几年似的。
    六月二十二日的早晨，达尼洛夫醒来太晚，他就对太太生起气来：干吗她没把他叫醒呢。
    “达尼洛夫，战事爆发了，莫洛托夫广播的……”
    他跑到屋里。无线电播送完了，毫无疑问了。无线电停止了。达尼洛夫抬起头来。一切都变样了。太阳的发光也变样了。他的房子也不同了。太太的脸也不同了。那种安宁恬澹的时光，有如隔世似的飞逝了。一切都跟着他的思想，流水似的飞逝了。
    “爸爸，咱们总是去吧？是不是？”儿子问道。
    儿子当时四岁了。
    “不去了，”达尼洛夫回答着，儿子就哭起来了……
    达尼洛夫这天翻阅了自己的信件，给父亲写了一封信，并且到邮局给老人家汇了些钱。
    在许多旧信里，有一个揉皱了的信封，一张相片角，从里边露出来，——他没把相片抽出来，不看就把它丢到抽屉底里了。
    他把儿子的照片放到小皮夹里。
    夜里太太呜咽着，低低的哭着，怕惊动了他。他装着睡着了。
    她留意到他在动，就抬起身来，从上边看着他的脸：
    “可是你可以暂免兵役（注）呢，达尼洛夫？”
    他转过身来。当早晨无线电广播的时候，问题就决定了。明天他要到作战部去的。至于她——她的事小着呢，她是一个渺不足道的人。
    早晨他收到了通知。这样更好呢。这样不会有人说他浮上水呢。被动员去就是了。
    作战部把他派到波塔宾珂那里去了。波塔宾珂是一个熟朋友，是疗养院院长。他坐在桌旁，穿着军服，推光了头，变得年轻了，周围挤满了穿便衣的人。虽然这些人都是刚来的，虽然窗子也都是敞开的，可是屋里却抽烟抽得叫人连气也上不来。
    波塔宾珂向达尼洛夫伸着温暖的、发肿的手。
    “呵哈，你来了。你是来请求免役的吗？”
    “不是的。”
    “好吧，你等一会。”波塔宾珂说着。
    其实不必叫达尼洛夫等得象这样久的，波塔宾珂甚至提前接见了那些后来的人，——达尼洛夫明白了：波塔宾珂想在他面前夸耀呢。他当时心里很畅快，觉得达尼洛夫还穿着便服在等候着，而他却已经穿着军服，而且有人到他这儿接受委任和命令了。双下巴的，刮得明光的波塔宾珂的脸，得意的发着光辉。他把白眉头一皱，想把那光辉掩起来，可是一点结果也没有。最后他把达尼洛夫叫到跟着。
    “坐下，”波塔宾珂说。“你干过军队吗？”
    “干过。”
    “好吧，”波塔宾珂往笔记本里记着说。“你到救护列车上担任政治委员吧。别忙，”他预先提防着达尼洛夫的反驳说。“你的话我都知道。可是总得到救护列车上去。应该组织列车。你知道这怎么办吗？”
    “不知道。你知道吗？”
    “我也不知道，”波塔宾珂说。“真是作难的事情呵，达尼洛夫。”
    “真是作难的事情呵。”达尼洛夫同意着。
    注：免役——凡残废者或另有特殊任务之专家，可免兵役。　　（未完）
