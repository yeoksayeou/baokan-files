    [This newspaper reports] The Lushun-Dalian area plans to systematically eliminate illiteracy throughout the entire region within two years. Since the beginning of March this year, over 70% (more than 230,000 people) of the illiterate population has participated in literacy studies over the past four months. The main target for eliminating illiteracy is young and middle-aged people (from 14 to 45 years old), divided into workers, farmers, and urban residents. The literacy requirement for workers is set at 1,200 characters, 800 for farmers, and 1,000 for urban residents. The 30,000 illiterate workers are the responsibility of the various factory spare-time schools, ensuring that each person learns two characters per day. The 10,000 illiterate individuals within government agencies and organizations are guaranteed literacy through spare-time learning within the agencies. For the 210,000 illiterate people in rural areas, five literacy classes are opened in each administrative village, with each class admitting 40 illiterate people. With 331 administrative villages in the region, 66,000 illiterate people can be eliminated each year, eliminating 130,000 in two years. The remaining 80,000 are mostly women with many children and heavy housework, who are organized into "kang-head" [referring to a traditional heated brick bed] study groups. There are approximately 50,000 illiterate urban residents. Currently, over 140 literacy night schools have been established in Dalian, accommodating 25,000 people. It is expected that all will be enrolled next year. The entire movement is conducted under the leadership of the regional literacy movement committee. Teachers are recruited through the method of "little teachers" (primary and secondary school students) and mass teachers (local intellectuals) providing voluntary teaching. Most of the funding is resolved through donations. Each illiterate person who passes the exam and meets the prescribed standard is issued a culture certificate.

    【本报讯】旅大地区预定在两年内有计划地肃清全区文盲。今年三月开始，四个月来已有百分之七十以上（二十三万余人）的文盲参加了识字学习。消灭文盲的重点对象是青壮年（从十四岁到四十五岁），在阶层上分为工人、农民、市民。对工人的识字要求定为一千二百字，农民八百字，市民一千字。三万工人文盲由各个工厂业余学校自己负责，保证每人每天识两个字。一万机关团体内的文盲，由机关业余学习保证扫除。二十一万农村文盲，在每个行政村开五个识字班，每班吸收四十个文盲，全区三三一个行政村，每年可消灭六万六千个文盲，两年消灭十三万，其余八万余均为孩子多和家务重的妇女，组织炕头学习小组。市民文盲约五万，目前在大连市已办了一百四十余处识字夜校，容纳了二万五千人，明年可全部入校。整个运动是在全区识字运动委员会领导下进行的。教员是采取小先生（中小学生）及群众教师（地方知识分子）义务教学的办法，经费大部从募捐中解决。每个文盲经过考试达到规定标准后，即发给文化证。
