One Week of Study at the Party Training Class
    Nan Shi

    When comrades first arrived at the Party Training Class, although they generally harbored a desire to transform their thinking, some comrades held unrealistic fantasies. Some wanted to listen to more reports and delve into thick theory books; others wanted to meet Chairman Mao. On the opening day, after listening to the reports by Comrades Liu Ren and Xiang Ziming and discussing them, they clarified in their minds that the main purpose of studying at the Party Training Class was to transform their thinking, establish a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary worldview, strengthen their mass perspective, and learn how to work.

    During this week or so of study, the principle of linking with reality, focusing on fewer but more refined studies, and concentrating on solving major problems was implemented. Our greatest gain was beginning to explore methods of transforming thinking by linking theory with practice. The content of the first week of study was historical materialism: labor creates the world; five modes of production – class struggle; on social ideology and consciousness (three parts). Initially, because comrades were accustomed to the learning methods of delving into books and memorizing dogmas in school, some comrades lacked sufficient understanding of the purpose of studying historical materialism, which is to transform thinking, establish a labor perspective, a class perspective, and a materialist perspective. They thought that they had already learned and understood these principles and did not need to study them again. In chat sessions and group meetings, the issues discussed were mostly irrelevant, ranging from socialist society to what kind of society would exist after communist society, and arguing for a long time without reaching a conclusion. It was all just moving from book to book, and not connecting with their own ideological reality. The reason for this tendency was that some comrades did not know how to connect with reality, or were unwilling or afraid to expose their thoughts. The various branches promptly pointed out this tendency and provided specific help to overcome it. As a result, the content of the chat sessions and group meetings became richer, and learning began to get on the right track, and comrades began to boldly expose their thoughts. Comrade Zhao Shufeng of the Fifth Branch examined his speculative thoughts of the exploiting class. When exchanging counterfeit gold yuan after the liberation of Beiping, he tried to exchange more because workers and students were given preferential treatment. Comrade Chen Can of the Third Branch made a self-reflection report at the branch general meeting, criticizing his past work attitude of working for personal gain, asking for rewards, and setting conditions; Comrade Yang Chuanwei of the Second Branch also deeply examined his personal heroism of wanting to overwhelm others and trample on others over the past ten years at the branch meeting; and when applying to join the Party, he first considered personal glory and development, and then considered the interests of the revolution.

    Comrades grasped the method of learning by linking with reality and mastered the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, making progress in their studies. Some comrades said: "In the past, I only wanted to secretly correct my mistakes. Today, I have completely broken down this kind of thinking. I must sting myself in order to correct my mistakes." Another comrade said: "In the past, when criticizing, I would first build a defensive position for myself, find a way out, and push the responsibility onto objective conditions. Today, I realize that only by thoroughly exposing my erroneous ideological consciousness, and with the supervision and help of comrades, can I correct my mistakes." By linking with reality and exposing their thoughts, comrades further truly realized the great role of Marxism-Leninism and how to apply it. One comrade happily said: "So this is how Marxism-Leninism is applied!"

    Through study, criticism, and self-examination, the thinking of comrades has generally improved—they have initially understood the labor perspective, the materialist historical perspective, and the class perspective; they have demanded to sweep away their non-proletarian ideological consciousness, establish a labor perspective, and consolidate their class position; they have further realized that ideological transformation is a long-term process, not something that can be completed within a few days by simply understanding it theoretically, and that ideological struggle needs to be constantly carried out in practice. Due to the further improvement of their level of awareness, many League members and comrades from the Literature and Construction field have put forward requests to join the Party.

    The gains of the week have been rich. The branch committee and group leaders have improved their leadership methods and experienced that leadership should be good at inspiring and guiding, promoting class friendship, taking good care of comrades, and uniting the group. On the evening of the 24th, each branch held democratic re-elections. Comrades seriously and responsibly examined the work of the branch committee during the week, summarized the achievements of the work, and excavated the shortcomings of the work. In summary, the general shortcomings were: the lack of better planned and organized leadership, the connection between groups and groups, and between branches and branches was not close enough, the student system was not fully utilized; the connection with ideological reality, the examination and criticism was not deep enough, focusing only on generality and failing to proceed with focus; the allocation of study time was not good enough, and the study of social ideology and consciousness was not sufficient. Comrades' original understanding of the Party Constitution from books was vague and not profound enough.

    From this practical election work, comrades learned how to conduct democratic elections within the Party in accordance with the Party Constitution, deepened their understanding of the Party Constitution, and experienced that practical knowledge can only be learned from practice.

    Today, in the continued upsurge of the learning craze, comrades are striving to overcome various shortcomings and biases and are conducting a study of "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship."

    党训班的一周学习
    南石
    同志们初到党训班的时候，虽然一般都怀着改造思想的要求，但有的同志却存着不切实际的幻想。有的想多听几次报告，啃大本的理论书；有的想见见毛主席。开学那天听了刘仁、项子明同志的报告，经过讨论，才在思想上明确地认清了党训班学习的目的主要在改造思想，确定马列主义的革命人生观，加强群众观点，学习如何工作。
    在这一周多的学习中，贯彻了与实际联系，学习的分量少而精，集中解决主要问题的方针。我们最大的收获是开始摸索到理论与实际联系改造思想的方法。第一周学习的内容是唯物史观：劳动创造世界；五种生产方式——阶级斗争；论社会思想意识三部分。最初，由于同志们在学校里一向习惯于啃书本、背教条的学习方法，有的同志对学习唯物史观的目的，是在于改造思想，建立劳动观点，阶级观点，唯物观点等认识不够，以为这些道理我早学过，早都懂了，用不着再学。在漫谈会和小组会上，讨论的问题大都不着边际，从社会主义社会扯到共产主义社会后还有什么社会，争论半天也得不到结论。从书本到书本，和自己的思想实际沾不上边。这种偏向产生的原因，由于一些同志不知道如何联系实际，或者不愿暴露不敢暴露思想。各支部及时指出这种偏向并具体帮助克服。于是，漫谈会小组会的内容丰富了，学习才开始走上正轨，同志们开始大胆地暴露思想了。五支部赵树枫同志检讨他有剥削阶级的投机思想，在北平解放后兑换伪金圆券时，因为优待工人学生，他便设法多兑。三支部陈灿同志在支部大会上作了反省报告，批评了他过去工作从个人利益出发，要报酬讲条件的雇佣劳动态度；二支部杨传纬同志也在支部会上深刻检讨了他十几年来要压倒别人，从别人身上践踏过去的个人英雄主义思想；和在申请入党时首先考虑个人的光荣和发展，然后才考虑革命的利益。
    同志们掌握了联系实际的学习方法；掌握了批评自我批评的武器，在学习中获得了进展。有的同志说：“过去只想偷偷改正错误，今天将我这种思想彻底打垮了，一定要刺痛自己，才能改正错误”。另外一个同志说：“过去批评的时候，先给自己装好炮台，找好退路，把责任推到客观条件的身上去，今天才认识只有彻底暴露自己错误的思想意识，在同志们的督促与帮助下，才能改正。”通过联系实际，暴露思想，同志们才进一步真正认识到马列主义的伟大作用和如何运用。一个同志高兴地说：“马列主义就是如此运用的啊！”
    通过学习、批评和检讨，同志们思想普遍提高了—初步认识了劳动观点，唯物的历史观点、阶级观点；要求扫除自己的非无产阶级的思想意识，建立劳动观点，巩固阶级立场；更认识到思想改造是一个长期过程，不是单从理论上认识了几天之内就可完成的事情，需要在实践中不断地作思想斗争。由于觉悟程度进一步的提高，参加学习的团员和文建的同志不少提出了入党的要求。
    一周的收获是丰富的，支委会小组长改进了领导方法，体验到领导要善于启发诱导，要发扬阶级友爱，很好地照顾同志，团结小组。二十四号晚上，各支部进行了民主改选，同志们严肃负责地检讨支委会一周的工作，总结工作的成绩，挖掘工作的缺点。综合起来一般的缺点是：还缺乏更好地有计划有组织的领导，小组与小组、支部与支部的联系不够紧密，留学制没有充分利用；连系思想实际，检讨批评还不够深入，只注重普遍而未能有重点地进行；学习时间分配不够好，论社会思想意识没有充分学习。同志们原来从书本对党章的了解是模糊不清和不够深刻的。
    从这次实际的选举工作中，同志们学习了怎样按照党章进行党内的民主选举，加深了对党章的认识，体验到从实践中才能学到实际的知识。
    今天，在继续高涨的学习热潮里，同志们正在努力克服各种缺点、偏向，进行“论人民民主专政”的学习。
