    Rapid Development of Postal Services in North China
    Postal Network Now Covers the Entire Region
    Total Postal Route Length is 680,000 Li
    Postal Service Reaches Both Domestic and International Locations
    [Reported by this newspaper] The North China Postal Administration reviewed its postal construction work for the first half of this year, and compared to last year, there has been significant progress in all aspects. In terms of postal route length, as of last December, the total length of trunk and branch lines in the region was more than 19,500 li. By June of this year, it had increased to more than 34,890 li. Together with the rural postal routes throughout the region, the total length of postal routes in North China has reached more than 687,200 li, and the postal network now covers the entire region. In terms of postal organization, the bureau has consistently adopted a streamlined approach and has achieved considerable success. For example, the 584 bureaus and stations under the bureau have an average of 13.7 people per bureau, which is lower than that of the Chinese Postal Service during the Anti-Japanese War. In the old liberated areas, based on the personnel establishment, the average is only 10.2 people per bureau. Since the Republic of China (except for 1919, 1920, and 1921), the average number of people per bureau in the Chinese Postal Service has never been lower than this figure. The bureau's business policy of "developing existing business, launching new business, expanding state-owned business, and expanding joint business" has now led to the establishment of 20 kinds of businesses, among which the parcel business in Tianjin and Beijing is the most developed. Vigorously developing this business will greatly increase postal revenue. Mail to the liberated areas has always been shipped from Tianjin to Hong Kong and then forwarded to various locations by the Guangzhou Bureau. International mail is forwarded via sea through Hong Kong, and land routes are forwarded via Harbin through Siberia. Recently, the Tianjin and Beijing bureaus have received many pieces of mail from London, New York, Canada, San Francisco, and other places. The scope of postal service has now reached both domestic and international locations.

    华北邮务迅速发展
    邮网已密布全区
    邮路全长六十八万里
    通邮范围遍及国内外各地
    【本报讯】华北邮政检查了今年上半年的建邮工作，与去年比较，各方面均有显著进展。邮路长度，截至去年十二月，全区干、支线共长一万九千五百余里，今年六月则已增至三万四千八百九十余里，连同全区乡邮线，华北邮路全长已达六十八万七千二百余里，邮网已密布全区。邮政组织方面，因该局一向采用精简方针，亦获得相当成绩，如该局所属各局站五百八十四处，平均每局一三·七人，较中华邮政在抗战时期为低，而老解放区，按照人数的编制计算，平均每局只一○·二人，民国以来（除民国八、九、十年外），中华邮政每局平均数从未低过此一数字。该局本“发展原有业务，举办新业务，开展国营业务，扩大联营业务”的业务方针现已举办二十种，其中平津两地包裹业务最为发达。大力开展此一业务，将大为增加邮政收入。对待解放区邮件，一向由天津海运至香港交广州局转发各地，国外邮件则由海路经香港转发，陆路由哈尔滨经西伯利亚转发。最近平津两局已收到伦敦、纽约、加拿大、旧金山等地寄来邮件多起，通邮范围，已遍及国内外各地。
