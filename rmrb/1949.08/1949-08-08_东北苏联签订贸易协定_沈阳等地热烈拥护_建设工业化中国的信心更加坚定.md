Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 7th. People from all walks of life in Shenyang, Dalian, and other places enthusiastically support the trade agreement signed between the Northeast People's Government and the Soviet Union. They unanimously believe that this agreement has given a head-on blow to the reactionary forces at home and abroad who are attempting to blockade our ports, and has made the people of the whole country even more confident in overcoming difficulties and building an industrialized China. In recent days, factories, institutions, schools, and business circles in Shenyang have held meetings and discussions. Yan Qingxian, a worker at the Shenyang Rubber Factory No. 4, said, "In the past, when the Kuomintang traded with the United States, large quantities of soybeans were shipped to the United States, and what was shipped back were all glass belts, glass raincoats, and the like. Now the Soviet Union is exchanging machines with us and helping us build our industry. This proves that the Soviet Union is our good friend." Many workers in the factory said: Farmers hand over their soybeans, vegetable oil, and grain to the state in exchange for machines and gasoline. We should work more actively, improve quality, oppose waste, and manufacture more industrial products for farmers to use. Lu Guangji, chairman of the Shenyang Chamber of Commerce, believes that after the establishment of the People's Democratic United Government, it will also establish nationwide trade relations with the Soviet Union and further conduct trade with the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe. Qiao Chuanjue, vice chairman of the Lushun-Dalian Administrative Office, believes that "this agreement will further enhance the friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union."

    东北苏联签订贸易协定
    沈阳等地热烈拥护
      建设工业化中国的信心更加坚定
    【新华社沈阳七日电】沈阳、旅大等地各界人民热烈拥护东北人民政府与苏联签定的贸易协定，一致认为这一协定给了国内外反动派封锁海口的阴谋一个迎头痛击，使全国人民对克服困难、建设工业化中国的信心益趋坚定。连日来沈阳市工厂、机关、学校和工商界纷纷集会座谈。沈阳树胶四厂工人颜庆贤说：“过去国民党与美国通商时，大批黄豆运到美国去，运回来的尽是玻璃皮带、玻璃雨衣等。现在苏联换给我们机器，帮助我们建设工业。这证明苏联是我们的好朋友。”该厂许多工人们表示：农民将自己生产的大豆、菜油和粮食交给国家，换来机器和汽油，我们应更加积极生产，提高质量，反对浪费，制造更多的工业品，供给农民使用。沈阳市商会会长卢广绩相信人民民主联合政府成立以后，还要同苏联建立全国性的贸易关系，并进一步和东欧新民主主义国家进行贸易。旅大行署副主席乔传珏认为：“这一协定将更增进中苏两大民族的友谊。”
