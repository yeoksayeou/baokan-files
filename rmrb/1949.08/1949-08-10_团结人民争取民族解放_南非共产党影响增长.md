    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 9th: TASS reports: As a result of the policies currently implemented by the Malan government in South Africa, residents of the Union of South Africa are living miserable lives. The Malan government is a faithful lackey of American monopoly capitalists, completely disregarding the vital interests of the indigenous people. Only 10 percent of all arable land in the Union of South Africa belongs to the indigenous people. Most farmers have no more than one or two hectares of land per family. However, European farmers mostly occupy more than 85 hectares of land per family, and many large white farms and plantations occupy more than 500 hectares. The slave system is still retained in the Union of South Africa to this day. Diseases are prevalent among the indigenous residents, especially lung diseases. The mortality rate of children is as high as 40 to 50 percent. The government spends only 10 percent of the total social insurance expenditure on social insurance for non-Europeans. Despite all kinds of oppression and discrimination, the political consciousness of the people is growing day by day. The Communist Party of South Africa resolutely exposes the policy of the ruling clique to follow in the footsteps of American imperialists. The prestige and influence of the Communist Party among the residents is growing day by day. The Communist Party is tirelessly uniting the strength of the people to fight for their national liberation.

    团结人民争取民族解放
    南非共产党影响增长
    【新华社北平九日电】塔斯社讯：由于目前南非马兰政府所实行的政策的结果，南非联邦居民正过着凄惨的日子。马兰政府是美国独占资本家的忠实走狗，完全不顾本国土人的切身利益。南非联邦全部耕地只有百分之十属于土人。大部分农民每家土地不超过一或二公顷。而欧洲人农民大多每家均占有八十五公倾以上的土地，许多白人的大农场及园地则占地五百公顷以上。在南非联邦直到今天仍保留蓄奴制度。土著居民中疾病盛行，尤其是肺病。儿童的死亡率，高达百分之四十至五十。政府花于非欧洲人的社会保险费用，仅为全部社会保险费用的百分之十。虽然有种种压迫与歧视，人民的政治觉悟正日益增长。南非联邦的共产党坚决地揭露统治集团步美国帝国主义者后尘的政策。共产党在居民中的威信与影响正日益增长。共产党正不疲倦地团结人民的力量，为争取他们民族的解放而斗争。
