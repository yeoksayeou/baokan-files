    The Youth League Propaganda Department and China Youth Publishing House Hold a Symposium on Studying Social Sciences
    [Ping City News] The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League and the China Youth Publishing House invited social science workers to a symposium yesterday (the 2nd) at 7:30 PM to discuss how young people should study social sciences and how "China Youth" should help young people study social sciences. Zhang Zhongshi, Deng Chumin, Song Yunbin, Wang Yanan, Di Chaobai, Ma Te, Ye Dingyi, Wu Min, and others attended. At the meeting, Yang Shu, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Youth League Central Committee and Director of the China Youth Publishing House, explained the significance of the symposium. Attendees then expressed their opinions, unanimously agreeing that studying social sciences means studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and should start from practical and specific issues, subjecting these practical issues to systematic and correct analysis. "China Youth" should focus on helping young people study politics, and should regularly answer questions arising from political courses studied by college and middle school students, as well as questions related to youth self-cultivation, life, and various personal issues. Attendees also suggested that "China Youth" should add book reviews of important social science books and explanations of terms, among many other specific suggestions.
