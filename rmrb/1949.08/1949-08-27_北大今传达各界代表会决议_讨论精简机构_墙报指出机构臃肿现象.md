　　Peking University Conveys Resolutions of All-Circles Representative Conference
　　Discusses Streamlining Institutions
　　Wall Posters Point Out Overstaffing

　　[Report from this Newspaper] The Peking University Faculty and Staff Union, the Workers and Police Union, and the Student Union will convene a general meeting in the lawn of the Science Building this morning (August 27th). Professor Luo Changpei and student Gu Qizong will convey the resolutions of the All-Circles Representative Conference of Beiping Municipality and discuss how to streamline administrative institutions and practice economy at Peking University.

　　The "New Peking University" wall newspaper recently published three major issues, pointing out that Peking University has over 1,900 faculty, staff, and police, with a ratio of almost one to one with the students. The bloated and unwieldy institution has led to low administrative efficiency and serious waste. It also pointed out that there is a lack of talent and manpower in rural areas today. Therefore, streamlining institutions and dispersing excess urban population to the countryside is not only a passive saving of the people's millet, but also has the positive significance of developing rural production and education. "New Peking University" used clear illustrations to show the waste of personnel allocation at Peking University and the serious increase in the burden on farmers, and used clippings to introduce reports on streamlining and saving in Central and East China. One student said, "Before liberation, I used to boast about the size of Peking University. After reading 'New Peking University,' I am truly ashamed!" The Chinese Department posted a big-character poster, believing that the resolutions of the Representative Conference are the concentrated opinions of the two million people of Beiping Municipality and must be practically implemented. All the students of the Chinese Department remaining at the school will participate in tomorrow's school-wide conference. The Peking University Youth League also held a meeting of League members yesterday noon, deciding to implement the resolutions of the Representative Conference and launch a streamlining and economy movement.

　　北大今传达各界代表会决议
    讨论精简机构
  　墙报指出机构臃肿现象
    【本报讯】北大教职员联合会、工警联合会、学生会订于今日（二十七日）上午在理学院草坪召开全体大会，由罗常培教授及古奇踪同学传达北平市各界代表会议决议，讨论如何在北大精简行政机构，厉行节约。
    “新北大”墙报最近连出三大刊，指出北大教职工警达一千九百余人，与同学之比为一比一，臃肿庞大的机构造成北大行政效率的低落与严重的浪费；并指出今日农村人材与人力缺乏，因此精简机构，疏散城市多余人口下乡，不仅是消极地节省人民的小米，并有发展农村生产与教育的积极意义。“新北大”以显明的插图表明北大人员配备的浪费与严重地加重农民负担的情形，并以剪贴版介绍华中及华东各地精简节约的报导。一位同学说：“解放前我曾以北大机构庞大而自夸，看了‘新北大’以后，真是惭愧极了！”中文系贴出大字报，认为代表会议决议是平市二百万人民的集中意见，必须实际执行。中文系全体留校同学皆将参加明日全校大会的讨论。北大青年团也于昨日中午召开团员大会，决定贯彻代表大会决议，展开精简节约运动。
