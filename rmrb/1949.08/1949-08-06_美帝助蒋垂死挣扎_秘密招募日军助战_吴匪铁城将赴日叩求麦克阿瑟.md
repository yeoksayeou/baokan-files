Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 5th -- It is reported that under the direction of American imperialism, the Kuomintang bandit gang is actively organizing the so-called "Pacific Anti-Communist League" and is also secretly recruiting 100,000 Japanese soldiers to come to China to help the remaining bandits fight. Traitor Wu Tiecheng will soon represent the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek in going to Japan. One of his missions is to plead with MacArthur to facilitate the early realization of this plan. This plot by the Kuomintang bandit gang to use the strength of Japanese bandits to carry out a desperate struggle was initiated as early as the time of the Huaihai Campaign defeat. On January 26 of this year, after the bandit leaders Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren successively issued statements seeking peace, they released Okamura Neiji, the former commander-in-chief of the Japanese invading forces in China, a special war criminal with blood on his hands, who had served as Chiang Kai-shek's military adviser after the Japanese surrender, to return to Japan, entrusting him to recruit Japanese officers and soldiers. On July 10, the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek went to the Philippines to plan the establishment of a Pacific League with Quirino, which included a specific item, namely, the demand that American imperialism and its running dogs in the Philippines, South Korea, and Japan organize so-called "international volunteer forces" to carry out armed intervention against the Chinese people. When Chiang Kai-shek went to the Philippines, he also sent Ge Wu＠, the special agent chief of the bandit military committee's investigation and statistics bureau, secretly to Japan to continue secret talks with Okamura Neiji, Watanabe Wataru (former chief of staff of Okamura Neiji), and others about recruiting 100,000 Japanese soldiers. The Chiang bandit has decided to pay each Japanese soldier a monthly family allowance of 40 US dollars and a food allowance of 10 US dollars, planning to use 120 million US dollars for 100,000 Japanese soldiers for two years. MacArthur, the US commander in Japan, has expressed his strong support for this plan. Therefore, the bandit Yan Xishan, famous for colluding with and utilizing Japanese troops, declared on July 18 that he would soon gather 200,000 "international volunteers," including Japanese soldiers, to fight against the People's Liberation Army.

    美帝助蒋垂死挣扎
    秘密招募日军助战
    吴匪铁城将赴日叩求麦克阿瑟
    【新华社上海五日电】据息：在美国帝国主义的指使下，国民党匪帮与积极地活动组织所谓“太平洋反共联盟”同时，正在秘密地招募十万日军准备来华帮助残匪作战。吴匪铁城日内即将代表匪首蒋介石前往日本，使命之一即在叩求麦克阿瑟，促成这一计划的早日实现。国民党匪帮这一图谋假借日寇力量，进行垂死挣扎的密谋，早在淮海战役失利当时，即开始进行。本年一月二十六日，即匪首蒋介石李宗仁相继发出求和声明以后，便释放前日本侵略中国的派遣军总司令，手上沾满中国鲜血的特号战犯，在日本投降后曾充任蒋介石军事顾问的冈村宁次返回日本，委托他代募日本官兵。七月十日，匪首蒋介石赴菲与季里诺筹组太平洋联盟，其中包含一项具体内容，就是要求美国帝国主义及其在菲、韩、日的走狗，组织所谓“国际志愿军”，对中国人民进行武装干涉。蒋匪在赴菲之时，又派遣了匪军委会调查统计局的特务头子葛武＠秘密赴日，与冈村宁次、渡边渡（前冈村宁次的参谋长）等人继续密商招募十万日军之事，蒋匪决对每一日兵按月发给安家费四十美元、副食费十美元，拟以一亿二千万美元作十万日兵两年之用。美国驻日统帅麦克阿瑟对于此项计划已表示竭力赞成。因此，以勾结日寇并利用日军作战著名的阎匪锡山乃于七月十八日宣称即将集募“国际义勇军”二十万人，包括日本兵在内，以与人民解放军作战。
