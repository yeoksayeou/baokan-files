　　Seventy Arsenal Rewards Inventions
　　Holds Creativity Symposium
　　Ten Outstanding Workers to be Awarded
    [This City News] Workers at the Seventy Arsenal have, for half a year, continuously invented and improved machine tool parts, increasing output and reducing costs. For example, the chuck claw designed by Fu Wanyu increased output by nine times. The automatic return valve designed by Wang Qian increased output by six times. The factory's trade union held a creativity symposium yesterday (the 17th), inviting Zhang Deshan, Fu Wanyu, Li Hongting, Men Ziming, Zhang Kun, Liu Shixian, Tang Zhishan, Wang Qian, Yuan Hongbin, and Wu Feng, ten workers with inventive achievements, to explain their creative process and exchange experiences. The trade union has also scheduled an award ceremony on the 20th, in front of all the factory workers, to present these ten outstanding workers with medals, shirts, and other items. (Nian Gao)
    [This City News] Liu Tieshan and Wang Hongjun, boiler management workers at the Mining and Metallurgical Research Institute under the North China People's Government Public Enterprise Department, improved the method of distilling water in the laboratory, increasing output to five and a half times that before liberation, and saving two-thirds of the fuel. After the liberation of Beiping, the institute's work gradually expanded, requiring a large amount of distilled water. Liu Tieshan and Wang Hongjun then conducted extensive research and experimentation, using iron sheets to close the furnace chimney door after the boiler was lit, concentrating heat on the distillation pot; and continuously injecting warm water from the condenser into the distillation pot, making it easier for the water in the distillation pot to vaporize and increasing the efficiency of the condenser. After this improvement, the output of distilled water increased from 20 liters before liberation to 110 liters per day, and two-thirds of the fuel was saved.

　　七十兵工厂奖励发明
  　举行创造座谈
  　十位优秀工人将受奖
    【本市讯】七十兵工厂的工人，半年来连续发明与改良工具机件，使产量增加，成本减少。象傅万煜设计的卡盘爪，使产量增加了九倍。王谦设计的自动退活瓣，使产量增加了六倍。该厂职工会特在昨日（十七日）举行创造座谈会，请有发明成绩的张德山、傅万煜、李宏庭、门子铭、张锟、刘世贤、唐志山、王谦、袁鸿宾、吴峰等十个工人，说明自己的创造过程，交流经验。职工会并定在二十日举行奖功会，在全厂工人面前，对这十位优秀工人，赠与奖章、衬衣等物。（念高）
    【本市讯】华北人民政府公营企业部所属矿冶研究所锅炉管理工人刘铁山、王鸿钧，改良化验室烧蒸馏水方法，使产量增至解放前的五倍半；并节省燃料三分之二。北平解放后，该所工作日渐开展，需要大量蒸馏水，刘铁山、王鸿钧两人遂多方研究试验，在锅炉燃着以后，用铁片关住炉囱门，使热力集中在蒸馏锅上；又把冷凝器里的温水，随时注入蒸馏锅内，使蒸馏锅里的水容易汽化，并增加冷凝器的效力。经过这样改良后，蒸馏水的产量由解放前的二十立升一跃而增加到每天一百一十立升，并节省燃料三分之二。
