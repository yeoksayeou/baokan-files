    Further Convenience for Citizens
    Shanghai Continues to Accept Foreign Currency Exchange
    [Shanghai, 6th (Broadcast)] The deadline for depositing and exchanging US dollars in this city has already passed. However, the Military Control Commission has recently received feedback from citizens stating that some still have foreign currency that they have not had time to exchange, and they request that the exchange continue. In order to address the difficulties of the people, the Military Control Commission has decided to continue allowing foreign currency to be deposited into the Bank of China from August 8th in exchange for foreign exchange deposit certificates or passbooks. However, intentional delays will not be permitted.

    再予市民方便
    沪继续收兑外币
    【上海六日广播】本市存兑美钞期限本来早已满期，但军管会近来收到市民意见，说还有一部分市民存留外币，没有来得及兑完，要求继续收兑。军管会为了照顾人民困难，从八月八日起继续准以外币存入中国银行，换取外汇存单或者存折，但是不得故意迟延。
