    [This City News] The Industrial Workers Work Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened a meeting of the union chairmen of various public factories and mines in the city at 9:00 AM on the 5th of this month. Comrades Zhang Hongshun and Li Chen summarized the work of democratization of factory management in July and clearly deployed six tasks for August:

    1. Based on past experience in carrying out democratic movements, continue to expand the democratic management movement. Before August, eight units, including Xishan Coal Mine, Waterworks, Liulihe Cement Plant, Telecommunications Bureau, and North China Highway General Bureau Beijing Transportation Company, established management committees. Four units, including the Tram Company and the 70th Ordnance Factory, conducted criticism and self-criticism. Among them, some, although they carried out democratic movements, failed to combine them with reality, and the cadres failed to conduct thorough reviews, and the masses were not mobilized. Some, although they established management committees, remained empty shells (such as the Waterworks). Based on this situation, factories and mines like the two types above need to deepen the democratic movement and enrich the content of the management committees. The majority of factories and mines urgently need to open up the minds of cadres in order to launch a democratic movement.

    2. Strengthen security work. This work has not been fully completed yet. Recently, the General Trade Union and the Enterprise Bureau issued special instructions, which were published in full by the People's Daily on the 5th, and the Workers' Daily published them for two consecutive days. Now they have been distributed to various factories. It is hoped that everyone will study these documents and demonstrate achievements in their work.

    3. Launch a production and thrift movement to overcome all difficulties. At present, although the production enthusiasm of workers in factories has improved, planned and organized production is still very insufficient. In addition, in terms of management, there are still many waste phenomena in the production process, and costs have not been well calculated. Everyone must supervise each other and oppose waste—this is also a way to increase production.

    4. Until now, the theoretical and policy level of our trade union comrades is still far from meeting the needs, and our emphasis on learning is also not enough. This presents us with a task—to strengthen professional study. Now, in order to help everyone solve problems in their work in a timely manner, the General Trade Union has specifically published many things, and we also have the organ of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions—the Workers' Daily, which can constantly guide our work. We should carefully study the Workers' Daily and constantly improve ourselves in our work.

    5. Substantially solve the problem of school enrollment for some employees' children, and carry out factory propaganda and education work in each factory with concrete facts to further improve employees' understanding of the relationship between the Communist Party and the People's Government.

    6. Further promote the complete establishment of medical clinics in all factories, or entrust hospitals to guarantee medical treatment for employees during illness, and take care of their families as much as possible.

    市总工会布置八月份公营厂矿工作
    继续展开民主管理运动
    生产节约加强保卫工作
    【本市讯】本月五日上午九时，北平市职工总会筹委会产业工人工作委员会，召集本市各公营厂矿的工会主任开会，由张鸿顺、李晨二同志总结了七月份的工厂管理民主化的工作。并明确地布置了八月份六项工作：
    一、根据以往搞民主运动的经验，继续展开管理民主化运动。八月前成立管理委员会的厂矿，有西山煤矿、自来水公司、琉璃河水泥厂、电信局、华北公路总局北平运输公司等八个单位。进行了批评和自我批评的有电车公司、七十兵工厂等四个单位。当中有的虽进行了民主运动，但因为不能结合实际，和干部没能深刻检讨，群众也没有发动起来；有的虽成立了管委会，却始终是个空架子（如自来水公司）。根据这样情况，象上面两种厂矿，是需要把民主运动深入一步，和把管委会内容充实起来；大部份厂矿，是急需打通干部思想，才能展开民主化运动。
    二、加强保卫工作。现在这个工作还没有完全做好，最近总工会和企业局又发了专门指示，人民日报于五日全文刊出，工人日报连登了两天，现在又发到各厂去，希望大家学习这文件，并在工作上表现出成绩来。
    三、展开生产节约运动克服一切困难。现在在工厂中，工人的生产积极性虽然已提高了一步，但有计划有组织的生产还是非常不够。另外在管理上，生产进程中还有不少的浪费现象，没有很好计算成本，必须大家互相监督，反对浪费——这也是增加生产的一方案。
    四、直到如今，我们工会工作同志理论政策水平，还十分赶不上需要，而我们重视学习也还不够，这就提给我们一个任务——加强业务学习。现在总工会为了及时帮助大家解决工作中的问题，专门出刊了许多东西，我们又有全国总工会的机关报——工人日报。能经常指导我们工作。我们应该好好地研究工人日报，在工作中不断地提高自己。
    五、切实的解决一部职工子弟入学问题，在各厂内以具体事实展开厂内宣传教育工作，进一步提高职工对共产党与人民政府关系的认识。
    六、进一步推动全部完成各工厂建立医务所，或嘱托医院保证职工患病期间的医药治疗，并尽可能照顾其家属。
