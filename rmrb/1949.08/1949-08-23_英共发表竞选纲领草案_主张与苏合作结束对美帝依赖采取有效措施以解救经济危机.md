Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 22nd: TASS, London, 19th: The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party has released a draft election program to be submitted for discussion at the 25th Congress of the British Communist Party, scheduled to be held in Liverpool in November. The program emphasizes that cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries can avert the mass unemployment and economic disasters that threaten Britain. These disasters are caused by the policies pursued by the Labour Party and the Conservative Party since the end of the war.

The program is divided into six parts, discussing every basic problem currently facing the British people, and proposes the following basic requirements: (1) Take effective measures to depreciate the interests of monopoly capital, reduce profits and prices, raise wages and living standards, expand nationalization and adjust foreign trade to solve the economic crisis. (2) Radically change foreign policy, end dependence on American imperialism, and make Britain stand on the side of the socialist Soviet Union and the progressive people of the world to guarantee peace and national independence. (3) Increase expenditure on social services, housing construction, health, and education.

The first part of the program warns that Britain is now facing a catastrophic economic downturn. The program points out: "The Labour government has made Britain more dependent on the United States, implementing rearmament and war plans, severely damaging Britain's basic economy." To repay the dollar, the Labour government allows large American corporations to dominate British industry and trade. The United States prevents Britain from buying grain, raw materials, and timber from the Soviet Union and its allies.

The program calls for lowering prices, abolishing purchase taxes on necessities, increasing wages, maintaining and expanding food subsidies, and increasing taxes on the wealthy.

The program calls for the democratization of the nationalized industrial bureaus and the representation of workers in each bureau, and demands that the following items be immediately nationalized: land, the construction industry and building materials industry, shipping, shipbuilding and ship repair, the chemical industry, the food industry, joint-stock banks, and industrial insurance companies. The program elaborates on the Communist Party's peace policy, emphasizing that Britain has been bound by the North Atlantic Treaty to a military force group under the control of American imperialism, and the Conservative government supports this strategy, which means the destruction of Britain. Next, the program exposes the Anglo-American group's policy of opposing the Soviet Union's proposal to ban atomic bombs and reduce armaments.

The program says: The results of Churchill and Bevin's policies are disastrous and will mean the bankruptcy of Britain.

Finally, the Communist Party urges all fighting workers in the Communist Party and the Labour Party to unite, break the capitalists' stranglehold on Britain, and pave the way for socialism.

　　英共发表竞选纲领草案
    主张与苏合作结束对美帝依赖采取有效措施以解救经济危机
    【新华社北平二十二日电】塔斯社伦敦十九日讯：英共执委会发表竞选纲领草案，以提交定于十一月间在利物浦举行的英共第二十五届大会讨论。纲领着重指出：英国与苏联及人民民主国家进行合作，就能够避免正威胁着英国的大批失业与经济灾难。这些灾难是工党和保守党自战争结束以来所奉行的政策所造成的。
    纲领分为六个部分，讨论英国人民目前所面临的每一基本问题，并提出基本要求如下：（一）采取有效措施，贬抑垄断资本的利益，削减利润和物价，提高工资及生活标准，扩大国有化和调整对外贸易，以解决经济危机。（二）急剧改变外交政策，结束对美帝国主义的依赖，使英国站在社会主义的苏联和世界进步人民一边，以保证和平和民族独立。（二）增加社会事业、房屋建筑、卫生和教育的费用。
    纲领的第一部分警告英国现在面临着灾难性的经济下跌。纲领指出：“工党政府使英国更加依赖于美国，实行重整军备和战争计划，剧烈损害英国的基本经济。”工党政府为了报答美元，让美国大企业支配英国工业与贸易。美国阻止英国从苏联及苏联的盟国购买粮食、原料和木材。
    纲领要求降低物价，废除必需品的购买税，增加工资，保持和扩大粮食津贴并增加对富有者的课税。
    纲领要求各国有化工业局的民主化和工人在各该局中的代表权，并要求下列各项应立即国有化：土地，建筑业及建筑材料业，航业、造船业和船只修理业，化学工业、食品工业，股份银行以及工业保险公司。纲领详细阐明共产党的和平政策，强调英国已因北大西洋公约而被束缚于美帝国主义控制下的军事武力集团，保守党政府一样支持着这一意味英国之毁灭的战略。接着，纲领又揭发英美集团反对苏联禁止原子弹及裁减军备之建议的政策。
    纲领说：邱吉尔和贝文政策的结果是灾难性的，将意味着英国的破产。
    共产党最后力促共产党和工党内的一切战斗的工人团结起来，打破资本家对英国的扼制，为社会主义开拓道路。
