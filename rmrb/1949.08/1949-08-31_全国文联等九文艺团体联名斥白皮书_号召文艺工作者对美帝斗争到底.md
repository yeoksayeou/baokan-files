Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 30th. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and other literary and art organizations have jointly issued a declaration against the US White Paper, the full text of which is as follows:

    The White Paper recently published by the US government is a confession of the criminal history of US imperialism's aggression against China. In order to enslave the Chinese people and turn China into a US colony, US imperialism has always supported the counter-revolutionary forces in China. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the United States provided assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits under the name of "Cotton and Wheat Loans," supporting the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in their "encirclement and suppression" of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army at that time. In the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, US aid to Japan was an open secret. Until the eve of the Pearl Harbor Incident, the US imperialists had not abandoned their appeasement policy toward Japan. Later, on the one hand, because of Chiang Kai-shek's incompetence and passive resistance against Japan, the US imperialists had to try their best to pull the Soviet Union out to confront the most elite Kwantung Army of Japan. But at the same time, they were afraid that the Soviet Union's participation in the war would hinder the US imperialists' conspiracy not to fundamentally eliminate Japanese fascism. Therefore, on the eve of the Soviet Union's entry into the war on September 8, US representatives and Japanese bandits continued to contact each other in Hong Kong and Shanghai, trying to persuade the Japanese bandits to surrender as soon as possible, on the grounds that the Soviet Union would not be lenient to Japanese fascists after its participation in the war. After Japan's surrender, US imperialism wanted to take the place of Japanese imperialism and give the Chinese people no chance to breathe, immediately driving its running dog Chiang Kai-shek to attack the Chinese people. From 1946 to today, US imperialism has resolutely supported Chiang Kai-shek, supplying Chiang Kai-shek with aircraft, artillery, military advisors, war plans, and all other military supplies, regardless of the opposition and condemnation of the Chinese people. The aid that Chiang Kai-shek received from the US government accounted for more than 50% of the Chiang Kai-shek government's financial expenditure. The Chinese people will forever remember the disasters that US imperialism has inflicted on us. The White Paper published by the US government is a helpless confession of this shameful behavior of the US government. And what forced the US government to publish this White Paper was the great victory of the Chinese people. Today, the US government has to consider: what to do next?

    The coming days will be the days when the US government studies how to use various conspiracies to undermine the Chinese revolution. US imperialism will not be reconciled to the victory of the Chinese people. In addition to continuing to aid Chiang Kai-shek in blockading and bombing the people and national property, US imperialism will also undermine China's revolutionary cause from both inside and outside. US imperialism will ideologically divide us. "Democratic Individualism" is a term that US imperialism has chosen from the counter-revolutionary dictionary. A worm has been placed on the fishing hook. Poison has been coated with sugar. US imperialism is fantasizing that some Chinese intellectuals will take the bait. This is a public insult to Chinese intellectuals by US imperialism. The so-called "democracy" of Wall Street is silver-plated shackles. If there are "democratic individualists" who are inclined to Wall Street, it is a betrayal of the Chinese people. It is not easy to find intellectuals like Hu Shih who lack shame and have lost the way of being a Chinese person.

    At the same time, US imperialism will continue to provoke the friendship between the Chinese people and the Soviet Union. This friendship has a history of thirty years. This is because the people of the two countries are in a world where imperialist forces are rampant, and they must unite to seek survival. The Chinese Revolution was carried out with the help of the Soviet Union. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Soviet Union was the first to aid China. The Chinese people have gained an extremely valuable experience from long-term struggles: if we want to achieve victory, we must learn from the Soviet Union and unite with the Soviet Union. Our victory is inseparable from the existence of the Soviet Union and the growing strength of the new democratic countries in Europe. The same is true in the future. As long as we can closely unite with the Soviet Union, the new democratic countries, the working people in the capitalist countries, and the oppressed nations, we will not only be able to smash the imperialist war conspiracies and defend peace, but also enable the revolutionary cause of various countries to develop smoothly, and mankind will be able to achieve freedom, happiness, and prosperity at an early date.

    These days are the happiest days for our people, and also the days when the Achesons are frowning. While celebrating our victory, we must also be vigilant: pay attention to every action of imperialism after its defeat! We call on all literary and art workers in the country to use all our strength to expose the various conspiracies of US imperialism, so that the people of the country can unite more closely and prepare to fight US imperialism to the end!

### 全国文联等九文艺团体联名斥白皮书  号召文艺工作者对美帝斗争到底

　　全国文联等九文艺团体联名斥白皮书
    号召文艺工作者对美帝斗争到底
    【新华社北平三十日电】中华全国文学艺术界联合会等文艺团体顷联名发表反对美国白皮书宣言，全文如下：
    美国政府最近所发表的白皮书，是美帝国主义侵略中国的罪恶历史的供状。美帝国主义为了奴役中国人民，为了把中国变成美国的殖民地，就始终支持中国的反革命势力。抗战前，美国曾以“棉麦大借款”的名义，给蒋匪以援助，支持蒋匪向当时的工农红军“围剿”。抗日战争初期，美国对日本的援助，是公开的秘密。直到珍珠港事变前夕，美帝还没有抛弃对日的绥靖政策。后来，一方面为了蒋介石的无能与消极抗战，使美帝不得不打算极力拉苏联出来对抗日本最精锐的关东军，但同时又怕苏联的参战将阻碍美帝的不愿根本消灭日本法西斯的阴谋，所以在九月八日苏联出兵的前夕，美帝的代表和日寇不断在香港与上海接触，想说服日寇及早投降，理由便是苏联一参战后，对日本法西斯就不会宽大了。日本投降后，美帝国主义就想取日帝国主义的地位而代之，使中国人民没有喘息的机会，马上驱使其走狗蒋介石向中国人民进攻。从一九四六年到今天，美帝国主义不顾中国人民的反对与斥责，坚决地支持蒋匪，供给蒋匪以飞机大炮、军事顾问、作战计划以及其它一切军事物资。蒋匪从美政府得到的援助，占蒋匪政府财政开支的百分之五十以上。中国人民永远记得美帝国主义所给予我们的灾难。美国政府所发表的白皮书，是美国政府的这种可耻行为的无可奈何的供状。而逼使美国政府不得不发表这个白皮书的，是中国人民的伟大胜利。时至今日，美国政府不得不考虑：以后怎么办？
    今后的一些日子，将是美国政府研究如何使用各种阴谋，以破坏中国革命的日子了。美帝国主义不会甘心中国人民的胜利的。美帝国主义除了继续援助蒋匪封锁及轰炸人民与国家财产等等暴行而外，并且要从内部和外部来破坏中国的革命事业。美帝国主义将在思想上分化我们。“民主个人主义”，就是美帝国主义从反革命的字典中所选择的一个名词。钓鱼的钩子上已安放上一条蚯蚓。毒药已蒙上糖衣。美帝国主义是幻想着中国的某些知识分子会来上这个钩的。这是美帝国主义对于中国知识界的公开侮辱。华尔街的所谓“民主”，是镀了银的镣铐。如果有倾向于华尔街的“民主个人主义者”，便是对于中国的人民的叛卖。象胡适之那样缺乏羞耻心的丧失了中国人为人之道的知识分子，现在是不容易找到了。
    同时，美帝国主义将继续挑拨中国人民和苏联之间的友谊。这种友谊，已有三十年的历史。这是因为两国人民处在帝国主义势力猖狂的世界上，必须团结以求生存的缘故。中国大革命是在苏联的帮助下进行的。抗日战争时期，苏联首先援助了中国。中国人民已从长期斗争中取得了一条极宝贵的经验：如要取得胜利必须学习苏联，和苏联团结在一起。我们的胜利，是和苏联的存在，和欧洲各新民主主义国家的日益壮大分不开的。今后也一样，只要我们能和苏联、各新民主主义国家、各资本主义国家内的劳动人民、以及各被压迫民族紧紧地团结起来，我们就不但能粉碎帝国主义的战争阴谋，保卫了和平，并且能使各国的革命事业顺利的发展，人类能早日得到自由幸福与繁荣。
    这些日子，正是我们人民最愉快的日子，也是艾奇逊们愁眉苦脸的日子。我们一边庆祝自己的胜利，一边也要警惕起来：注意帝国主义在失败之后的每一个行动！我们号召全国文学、艺术工作者，用我们的一切力量，揭露美帝国主义的各种阴谋，使全国人民更紧密地团结起来，准备和美帝国主义斗争到底！
