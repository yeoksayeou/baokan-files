    The enemy passed through here,
    And swept through both sides of the road.
    The girl who grinds grain,
    Grabbed Comrade Wang Qin,
    Took off her blue cloth shirt,
    And put it on Comrade Wang Qin.
    She also put a blue cloth towel
    On top of his head;
    The clothes and the towel
    Looked as if they were covered in a layer of frost.
    The enemy was in Little Li Village,
    Searching door to door
    For a very Red
    Female Communist Party member.
    "Guadada!
    Guadada!"
    Comrade Wang Qin
    Sat in the mill,
    Sifting flour with his head down.
    The enemy passed by,
    Comrade Wang Qin
    Let out a long breath:
    "Thank you!
    You clever
    Good girl!"

    推磨的姑娘
    游击区小故事
    冬池
     敌人从这里过路，
     又沿着公路两边扫荡。  
     推磨的姑娘，
     一把抓住王勤同志，
     把蓝布衫子脱下，
     穿在王勤同志底身上。  
     还把一条蓝布手巾
     顶在她底头上；
     衣服和手巾
     都象落着一层白霜。
     敌人在小李庄，
     挨门搭户地
     搜查一个很红的
     女共产党员。  
     “呱达达！
     呱达达！”
     王勤同志
     坐在磨房里，
     低着头筛面。  
     敌人过去了，
     王勤同志
     出了一口长气：
     “谢谢你！
     你这个聪明的
     好姑娘！”
