Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 17th: TASS, New York dispatch: The United Nations Organization released on August 7th Secretary-General Lie's annual report on the work of the United Nations from July 1, 1948, to June 30, 1949. In the preface to the report, Lie declared: The year now under review is, generally speaking, a year moving towards a more peaceful world. Lie mildly and indirectly criticized the North Atlantic Treaty. He said: Although the differences between the major powers continue, and the movements for national independence and social unrest in many parts of the world "inevitably contribute to international tensions," the horror of war has diminished, and "the lifting of the Berlin Blockade is a major factor in achieving this result." Lie also stated: The United Nations, regarding the issues of Palestine, Kashmir, etc., "the Security Council has quite successfully handled them based on the principle of great power unity during the most critical period of tension between the great powers. ... There have been so many rumors about the paralysis of the Security Council and the consequent inability of the United Nations to prevent war that attention should be paid to the Security Council's record on these and several other disputes." The report further pointed out: "The important point is that in the coming months, we should not miss the opportunity to further promote peace because of any misunderstanding of the role of the United Nations in preventing war, or because of facing the 'East-West' divide. This misunderstanding, coupled with an overemphasis on the immediate without long-term considerations, could lead to a series of actions or a series of inactions that would reduce the United Nations to a second-rate role in world affairs." Lie said: "Here, what I am referring to is not regional or bilateral agreements or alliances of this kind; their impact depends on the spirit in which they are implemented." At the end of the preface, Lie made some suggestions. He particularly pointed out the need for the great powers to "maintain contact to discuss issues and seriously consult with each other." Lie finally suggested approving the applications of all fourteen countries currently applying to join the United Nations.

　　联合国发表一年工作报告
  　谴责北大西洋公约赞扬大国一致原则
    【新华社北平十七日电】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国组织于八月七日发表秘书长莱氏关于一九四八年七月一日至一九四九年六月三十日期间联合国工作的常年报告。莱氏在报告的序言中宣称：现在所要检讨的一年，一般地说，是走向更加和平的世界的一年。莱氏温和而间接地批评了北大西洋公约。他说：虽然大国之间的分歧还在继续着，而且，世界上许多地方的民族独立运动和社会动荡，“不可避免地助长了国际上的紧张局面”，但是，战争的恐怖是减弱了，而且，“柏林封锁的解除，是达成此种结果的主要因素”。莱氏又称：联合国关于巴勒斯坦、克什米尔等问题，“安理会都已在大国之间紧张关系最危急的时期中，根据大国一致的原则相当成功地予以处理了。……关于什么安理会瘫痪与联合国因而无能阻止战争的传说，已经如此纷纭，因此，应该注意一下安理会在这些以及在其他若干纠纷上的纪录。”报告进而指出：“重要的一点，是我们在今后几个月之内，不应该因为对于联合国阻止战争的作用有着任何的误会，或者因为面对着‘东西之间’的分歧而错过更进一步促进和平的机会。这种误会，再加上过于强调眼前的而不作长远的考虑，就可能导向一连串的行动或者接连着的不能有所行动，那就会把联合国降低成世界事务中的二等角色。”莱氏说：“这里，我所指的，并不是区域或双边协定或者这一类的联盟，它们的影响是看它们被实行的精神而定。”在序言结尾中，莱氏提出一些建议。他特别指出大国有必要“保持接触，以讨论问题并且认真地互相协商”。莱氏最后建议批准目前正在申请的十四个国家全部加入联合国。
