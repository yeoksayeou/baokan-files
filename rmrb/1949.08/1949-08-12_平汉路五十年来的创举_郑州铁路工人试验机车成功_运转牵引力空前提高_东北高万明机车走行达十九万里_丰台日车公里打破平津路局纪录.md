    The Pinghan Railway's Innovation in Fifty Years
    Zhengzhou Railway Workers Successfully Experiment with Locomotives
    Unprecedented Improvement in Operational Traction
    Gao Wanming's Locomotive in Northeast China Reaches 190,000 Kilometers
    Fengtai's Daily Car Kilometers Break the Beijing-Tianjin Railway Bureau Record
    [Hankou News] Zhengzhou railway workers, responding to the Ministry of Railways' general call to "maximize locomotive efficiency and reduce transportation costs," demonstrated the working class's spirit of hard work, creativity, and overcoming difficulties, completing the experiment of increasing locomotive traction by 70 percent between Zhengzhou and Shekou. The experimental route extended from Zhengzhou to Shekou, a distance of 497 kilometers and 600 meters. The designated traction weight was 2,000 metric tons of swapped weight. The experimental locomotive was MK1-153, an unprecedented achievement on the Pinghan Railway, as large locomotives had never been used since the railway's inception.
    Train 3351 departed from Zhengzhou at 1:55 PM on the 23rd of last month, towing 44 cars, more than double the load capacity during the Japanese imperialist and Kuomintang rule. Previously, a train could carry at most 900 or 1,000 metric tons. The traction limit on the Changtaiguan-Xinyang section was 900 metric tons, and the traction limit on the Lijiazhai-Wushengguan section was 700 metric tons, requiring pusher locomotives. This time, with a traction weight of 2,000 metric tons, the train successfully navigated the 11‰ gradient between Changtaiguan and Xinyang; and with a traction weight of 1,065 metric tons, the train successfully navigated the 15‰ gradient between Lijiazhai and Wushengguan, all without using pusher locomotives. The above experiments proved that the locomotive's traction efficiency was fully developed, increasing locomotive traction by 100 percent and 70 percent. The speed was generally increased. The speed limit on the Xinyang-Guangshui section was 40 kilometers per hour, but this time the maximum speed reached 60 kilometers per hour. The speed limit on slow-moving bridges was 5 kilometers per hour, but this time the maximum speed reached 10, 15, or 20 kilometers per hour. This experiment proved that the creativity and pragmatism of the working class can overcome capitalist dogmatic experience and backward conservatism. Experimental train 3351 created an operational record for the Pinghan Railway in 51 years, solved several current difficult problems, and saved approximately half the locomotives. If we calculate based on the original ten pairs of trains operating between Zhengzhou and Hankou, then ten locomotives can be saved in the future, and the freight car turnaround rate can be greatly reduced. The basic factors in achieving these results are accepting the advanced experience of socialist Soviet Union and the precedent of concrete experiments in the Northeast, and the concrete manifestation of the working class being the masters of their own house.
    [Reported by this newspaper] The No. 894 locomotive of the Mudanjiang Railway Bureau in Northeast China, since July 6th of last year when it was contracted by driver Gao Wanming and nine other workers, safely traveled 95,000 kilometers in one year and five days until July 7th of this year, exceeding one Class A inspection (required every 50,000 kilometers), and exceeding the bureau's set mileage every month. Therefore, the locomotive gloriously received a prize banner from the Railway Department of the Northeast Political Committee, the entire team earned a special merit, Gao Wanming earned a major merit, and was elected as a special-class labor model of Mudanjiang Province.
    The achievement was mainly due to the discovery of four good ways to prevent accidents: 1. When shunting cars at the station, speeding up can easily cause collisions, and slowing down can cause delays. Therefore, when coupling cars, the crew closely communicated with the shunting crew, knew which track the train to be coupled was on, and then drove the locomotive into the station, which could be coupled immediately, shortening the stopping time and preventing collisions. 2. Before the train enters the station, about 300 meters from the signal, as long as it is not late, it can slow down. If the station does not drop the signal, it can stop immediately, preventing signal overruns and preventing wear and tear on the driving wheels. 3. When the train enters each stop, the fire brake is placed in the braking position, and the air is returned when starting. If the train does not move, it is known that some angle cocks are closed, and inspection must be carried out to ensure that no accidents occur. 4. In order to prevent danger when the train goes downhill, when the train goes downhill and has not sped up, first test the braking force of the brake, so that there is confidence when applying the brake. In addition, when the locomotive goes downhill, after applying the large brake, slowly return the air with the small brake, which is very beneficial because the driving wheels cannot be damaged.
    [Broadcast by the Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station] Tianjin, 11th: All the staff and workers of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Beijing-Tianjin Railway Bureau have completed the July production tasks and created new achievements. Locomotive MK1506 achieved a maximum daily car kilometer of 721.8 kilometers, with an average daily car kilometer of 359.9 kilometers. Locomotive MK1393 achieved an average daily car kilometer of 391.8 kilometers, breaking the historical record of the Beijing-Tianjin Railway Bureau. In addition, nine locomotives passed Class A inspection in July, exceeding the plan by one unit, and doubling the number in June. The Beijing-Tianjin Railway Bureau specially awarded the entire staff and workers of the depot a collective bonus of 100,000 yuan, a bonus of 70,000 yuan for crew teams and individuals, and announced commendations.

    运转牵引力空前提高

    丰台日车公里打破平津路局纪录
    【汉口讯】郑州铁路工人响应铁道部“发挥机车效能减低运输成本”的总号召，发挥了工人阶级艰苦创造克服困难的精神，完成郑、滠（滠口）间机车牵引力提高百分之七十的试验。此次试验里程由郑州至滠口，长达四百九十七公里又六百公尺，牵引吨数定为换重二千公吨，试验机车为ㄇㄎ一·一五三号，这在平汉铁路是一件史无前例的创举，因大型机车自平汉路有史以来就未使用过。
    三三五一次列车于上月二十三日下午一点五十五分自郑出发，拖载四十四辆，超过日本帝国主义及国民党统治时期载重量的一倍以上。过去一列车至多不过载重九百公吨或一千公吨，长台关信阳间的坡道牵引定数为九百公吨，李家寨武胜关间的坡道牵引定数为七百公吨，尚需补机推送。此次牵引二千公吨，连续闯过长台关信阳间千分之十一的坡度；又牵引一千零六十五公吨，连续闯过李家寨武胜关间千分之十五的坡度，均未使用补机。经过上面试验，证明机车牵引效能得到了充分发展，增加机车牵引力百分之百与百分之七十。速度普遍提高，信阳广水段线路速度限制四十公里，此次最高走到六十公里；慢行桥梁限制速度五公里，此次则最高达十公里或十五公里、二十公里。这次试验，证明工人阶级的创造性与实事求是的精神，可以战胜资本主义的教条经验及落后的保守主义。三三五一次试验列车创造了平汉铁路五十一年来的运转纪录，解决了目前若干困难问题，约计节省机车一半。如郑汉间按原定十对列车运转计算，那么今后可节省机车十台，并大大缩小货车周转率。获得这些成绩的基本因素，是接受社会主义苏联的先进经验与东北具体实验的先例，是工人阶级当家做主人的具体表现。
    【本报讯】东北牡丹江铁路局机务段八九四号机车，从去年七月六日由司机长高万明等九位工友包乘的那一天起，到今年七月七日的一年零五天中，安全走行九万五千公里，超过了一个甲检（规定五万公里甲检一次），每个月又都能超过局定走行公里。该机车因此光荣的获得东北政委会铁道部发给的奖旗，全组立下特功，高万明立了大功，并当选牡丹江省特等劳动模范。
    这种成绩的获得，主要是研究出四种防止事故的好办法：一、在车站甩挂车时，车开快了容易撞车，开慢了要误点，因此乘务员在挂车时，和调车员密切联系，知道要挂的列车在那一道线上，再把机车开进站，可以马上挂好，能缩短停车时间，又能不撞车。二、列车进站前，离信号三百米左右的地方，只要不晚点，就可以开慢点，遇上车站不落信号时，能马上停车，既不冒进信号，又不致磨损动轮。三、在列车进入每个停车站的时候，就把火闸放在制动位上，在开车时再回风，如果车开不动就知道有的折角塞门关上了，这时候就要检查，才能保证不出事故。四、为了使列车走下坡不发生危险，当列车下岭还没走快的时候，先试验制动机制动力的强和和弱，这样下闸的时候才有把握。另外机车下岭时，下完了大闸后，使小闸慢慢回风，这样作动轮不能啃，有很大好处。
    【北平新华广播电台广播】天津十一日消息：平津铁路局丰台机务段全体职工，完成了七月份生产任务，并且创造了新成绩。ㄇㄎ一五○六号，最高日车公里达到七二一·八公里，平均日车公里为三五九·九公里，ㄇㄎ一三九三号机车，平均日车公里达到三九一·八公里，打破了平津铁路局的历史纪录。此外，七月份甲检机车九台，超过计划一台，比六月份增加了一倍半。平津铁路局特地发给该段全本职工集体奖金十万元，乘务员组和个人奖金七万元，并且公布表扬。
