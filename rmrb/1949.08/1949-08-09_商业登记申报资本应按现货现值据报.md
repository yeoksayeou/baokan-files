To the Editor:

Now is the time for business registration in our city. I have some matters I am unsure about and would like your guidance: (1) I inherited my father's business, a shop, in 1947. During the period when Beiping was occupied, due to the continuous devaluation of the puppet Federal Reserve Bank notes and the mismanagement of the managers, the inventory was depleted day by day. When I inherited the shop, the inventory and debts offset each other. At that time, I increased the capital by 30 million puppet legal tender (approximately equivalent to over 10,000 catties of millet) and continued the business. When the puppet legal tender and the puppet gold yuan were exchanged at a rate of one yuan to three million yuan, the capital on the books was changed to ten yuan puppet gold yuan. After the liberation of Beiping, the People's Currency was exchanged at a rate of one to ten, and the capital on the books was changed to one yuan People's Currency. For this business re-registration, how should I fill in the capital item? Writing one yuan is unreasonable, but writing too much, I am afraid it will affect the profit sharing of my colleagues. Because we offset the annual assets and liabilities, and the surplus profit is divided equally between labor and capital, filling in more capital will increase the liabilities and reduce the surplus profit. However, in the current situation, the inventory in terms of assets converted into millet is not even enough to cover the original capital, so where is the surplus? But it can also be said that except for the one yuan of capital, everything else is surplus. Therefore, how should we determine the capital item when re-registering? I sincerely request your prompt instruction!

Sincerely,
Zhang Chengw

Mr. Zhang Chengwu:

The problem of declaring capital mentioned in your letter, calculated repeatedly with puppet Federal Reserve Bank notes, is unreasonable. Because your capital essentially bought goods and was not actually cash, so you should truthfully fill in the current value of all goods when you re-register this time and declare your capital. Regarding your concern about affecting the profit sharing of colleagues, you can calculate in detail, according to the rights that colleagues should enjoy, the amount they should occupy in current cash value, and indicate this when declaring. As for what you said about surplus and deficit, it is not related to declaring the current capital. (Industry and Commerce Bureau of the Beiping Municipal People's Government)

### 商业登记申报资本应按现货现值据报

    商业登记申报资本应按现货现值据报编辑同志：
    现在正值本市各行商业登记的时候，我有些不能决定的事项，请您给指示一下：（一）我在一九四七年中继承了父亲的遗产，一个店铺。这个店铺在北平沦陷期中，因伪联银券日益贬值，与经理人员的不善经营，使存货日亏，到我继承该铺的时候，已是存货与外债相抵，当时增加资本伪法币三千万元，（约合小米一万余斤），继续做起生意来。伪法币与伪金元券以一元比三百万元兑换时，帐上的资本被改为十元伪金元券。北平解放后，人民券以一比十兑换，这时帐上的资本又改做了人民券一元。这次商业重新登记，资本一项我应如何填写呢？写一元不合理，写多了，又怕影响同人们的分红。因为我们是把每年的资产与负债相抵，有余利劳资各半，资本填多即负债增大，余利则少了，可是以目下情形来说，资产方面的存货折合小米，还抵不上原来的资本，那有盈余？但又可以说除了一元的资本，全部是盈余。因此，我们在重新登记的时候，资本一项究应如何决定呢？恳请您速给我一个指示吧！
              章承吾启章承吾先生：
    来函所谈申报资本问题，以伪联银券，一再折合计算，是不合理的。因为你的资本，根本就买了货物，并未实存现款，所以你这次重新登记，申报资本，应将所有货物，按现在所值，据实填报。所云怕影响同人分红，可以详细核算，按同人应享的权利，应占有以现货款计算的若干，可在申报时注明。至于你所说的盈余与亏累，与申报现资本无关。（北平市人民政府工商局）
