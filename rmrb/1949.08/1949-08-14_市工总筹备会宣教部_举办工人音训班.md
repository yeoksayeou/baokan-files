    Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee Propaganda Department
    Holds Workers' Music Training Class
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to develop factory cultural work, enhance worker production enthusiasm, and cultivate worker music cadres, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee has decided to hold a workers' music training class. The training class will borrow the premises of the Municipal People's Broadcasting Station and be taught by six comrades from the Second and Third Cultural Work Troupes of North China University. It is expected to last two months and will teach workers basic knowledge of music theory, sight-reading, and conducting.
    The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also convened a symposium yesterday (the 13th) for the heads of propaganda and education departments of trade unions in various municipal public factories to discuss matters related to the factories recommending candidates for the training class. Representatives from over twenty units, including the North China Military Region Printing Factory, the Pingjin Railway Bureau, the Municipal Telecommunications Bureau, the 70th Ordnance Factory, and the Clothing Factory, attended. Opinions were widely exchanged at the meeting, and finally, the methods and numbers for selecting candidates were decided. It was also decided that in the future, each factory must establish a monthly reporting system on cultural and recreational activities to the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and strengthen connections between factories to broadly exchange experiences.

    市总工会并于昨（十三）日召集本市各公营工厂职工会宣教部负责人举行座谈，讨论各厂产生训练班人选事宜，出席有华北军区印制厂、平津铁路局、本市电信局、七十兵工厂、被服厂等二十余单位，会上普遍交换意见，最后决定产生人选办法与人数，并决定今后各厂必须向市总工会宣教部建立文娱活动的逐月汇报制，同时加强各工厂之间的联系，以便广泛地互相交流经验。
