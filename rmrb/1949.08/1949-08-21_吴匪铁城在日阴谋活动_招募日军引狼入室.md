Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 20th: Tokyo dispatch: Wu Tiecheng, one of the ringleaders of the Kuomintang anti-Party reactionary clique, after arriving in Japan on the 12th, secretly met with MacArthur twice, on the 13th and 18th, engaging in the insidious activities of recruiting Japanese soldiers to come to China to help the Kuomintang bandit gang fight. Although the content of the talks was not announced, Wu Tiecheng's public remarks in Japan are sufficient to indicate the Kuomintang's treasonous plan to collude with Japanese pirates. In his first statement after arriving in Japan on the 12th, Wu Tiecheng emphasized that "the time for greater understanding in Sino-Japanese relations has arrived." When receiving Japanese reporters on the 16th, he even repeated the Japanese militarists' invasion rhetoric, namely: "China and Japan cooperate to jointly oppose communism," and "Japan, with its status as an industrial country, needs China as a market and source of raw materials." According to a United Press International dispatch from Tokyo on the 18th: The Kuomintang bandit gang's mission in Tokyo publicly declared on the 18th that "a large number of former Japanese soldiers and air force personnel are requesting an opportunity to go to China and fight with the Kuomintang." The dispatch revealed that the Kuomintang's representative in Japan is holding "informal talks" in Tokyo with those who are "requesting." When announcing this news, the Kuomintang mission in Japan still denied that they had any plans to recruit Japanese people, attempting to use the shield of Japanese people automatically "requesting" to cover up their shameful crime of ushering wolves into the house.

　　吴匪铁城在日阴谋活动
  　招募日军引狼入室
    【新华社北平二十日电】东京消息：国反党反动派匪首之一吴铁城自十二日抵达日本后，即于十三日及十八日两次与麦克阿瑟密谈，从事招募日军来华帮助国民党匪帮作战的阴险活动。会谈的内容虽未公布，但吴铁城在日本的公开言论，已足以表明国民党勾结日寇的叛卖计划。吴铁城在十二日在抵日后的第一次声明中，即强调“中日关系取得更大谅解的时机已经到来”。在十六日招待日本各报记者时，他更重复日本军国主义者的侵华论调，即：“中日合作，共同反共”，“日本以工业国的地位，需要以中国为市场及原料供应地”。据合众社东京十八日电：国民党匪帮驻东京使团于十八日公开宣称：“大批前日本士兵与空军人员请求有机会到中国和国民党在一起作战。”该电透露，国民党驻日代表正在东京与“请求”人员，“作非正式会谈”。国民党驻日使团在公布这一消息时，仍然否认他们有招募日人的计划，企图以日人自动“请求”的盾牌，来掩盖其引狼入室的可耻罪行。
