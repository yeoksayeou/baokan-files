(Ping City News) The North China People's Government, in order to readjust administrative divisions to meet the needs of large-scale production and construction, issued a decree on August 1st to all levels of government for compliance. The full text of the decree is published below:

It is hereby announced that the entire North China region has been liberated. In order to adapt to the needs of large-scale production and construction, the Third Enlarged Plenary Session of this Government has decided to adjust the existing administrative divisions as follows:

1.  With the consent of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government and the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office, fifty counties in the Northwestern Shanxi and Southern Shanxi regions are incorporated. The four counties of Peixian, Fengxian, Xinshan (newly established county), and Tongbei (newly established county), which originally belonged to Jiangsu Province and were under the jurisdiction of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, are placed under the leadership of the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office.

2.  The seven administrative regions of Eastern Hebei, Central Hebei, Southern Hebei, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Taihang, Taiyue, and Taiyuan are hereby abolished. Based on the old provincial boundaries, and taking into account economic conditions, historical relations among the masses, and natural conditions, they are divided into Hebei Province, Shanxi Province, Chahar Province, and Suiyuan Province. Pingyuan Province is established in the junction area of Southwestern Shandong, Northern Henan, and Southern Hebei. Beiping and Tianjin are directly administered municipalities under the North China Government. Shijiazhuang and Taiyuan are changed to province-administered municipalities. The specific divisions are executed according to the attached table.

3.  The establishment of cities is changed to two types: directly administered municipalities under the North China Government and province-administered municipalities. In addition to the already determined directly administered municipalities and province-administered municipalities under North China, all other cities are abolished and renamed towns or urban districts, under the leadership of the special commissioner's office or county.

4.  If changes are necessary among provinces or within a province in the new divisions, they may be decided by this Government or adjusted and changed with the approval of the provincial government.
