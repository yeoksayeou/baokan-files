[Beijing News] The Municipal People's Government Enterprise Bureau and the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions have recently issued instructions to all factories on strengthening factory security work. The full text is as follows:

Since the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on establishing security work in public factories in April, more than two months have passed. During this period, apart from a few factory cadres who have begun to attach importance to this work and have made specific plans and arrangements, achieving certain results (for example, the Qinghe Woolen Mill extinguished a fire in the engine room on the morning of July 7th due to relatively complete fire-fighting equipment), most cadres still have serious complacency and disregard this work, and do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of factory security work. As a result, incidents of fire and theft in factories have continued to occur recently. Following the fires at the Tram Company and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Mentougou Coal Mining Company and the Xishan Coal Mine successively experienced fires and explosions in the gunpowder depot, and cotton combustion occurred in the clothing factory. In total, there have been as many as twenty-one fires in factories throughout the city in the past six months, causing huge losses to state property!

The reasons for these fires are: first, some administrative personnel and trade union cadres in the factories are irresponsible, manage carelessly, are not adequately prepared, and have lax discipline. Second, the workers are not vigilant enough, and their proactive and positive suggestions and actions to protect the factory are insufficient. Third, the conspiracies and sabotage of Kuomintang secret agents and bandits. In response to these serious phenomena, we must take effective measures to prevent similar incidents that may occur in the future.

Continue to Study Documents; Overcome Bureaucratism

Therefore, we must: First, constantly educate workers and all factory cadres on protecting state property and eliminating bandits and special agents. In mid-June and early July, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions successively instructed all factories to study the handling and circular of the North China People's Government regarding the fire at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, and the Xinhua News Agency short commentary "Protect the Property of the People's Motherland," "Eliminate Complacency and Extinguish Special Agents and Bandits," and other documents. However, many factory cadres neither study these documents themselves nor publicize and explain them to the workers, and do not study or strictly implement the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' instructions in this regard, which is a serious phenomenon of disorganization and indiscipline.

At present, administrative cadres and trade union cadres in all factories must continue to study the two documents previously instructed, and conduct extensive publicity and mobilization among all employees, so that everyone recognizes that protecting state property is the sacred duty of every employee, and mobilize all cadres and employees of the factory to wage a resolute struggle against those who disregard, waste, or damage state property. If we do not attack these bad bureaucratic practices in factory management, it will be impossible for us to completely avoid losses to factories.

Not only that, "we must call on all employees to heighten their vigilance and prevent the sabotage of special agents and bandits." Chairman Mao warned us: After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight us to the death. In the past, in some places, special agents and bandits were able to achieve their destructive purposes because some of our cadres were complacent, callous, derelict in their duties, and even unable to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves in their thinking and actions. In the future, the enemy will definitely take advantage of our weaknesses to carry out sabotage and disruption. We must heighten our vigilance and strictly prevent destructive incidents from happening.

Improve the Organization of Security Work; Inspect and Replenish Fire-Fighting Equipment

Second, improve and establish the organization of our factory security work. According to investigations, among the thirty-odd factories in the city, only eight had established factory security committees by June 20th, and some of these factories were perfunctory and simply changed the name of the air defense organization. The organization of the pickets is even more chaotic, with some participants being Kuomintang members who have not been vetted, some being scattered soldiers and vagrants who have recently entered the factory, and some being old guards who have not been reformed and educated and have been turned into pickets. Therefore, the composition of the pickets is complex and they cannot undertake or complete the tasks of fire prevention, anti-theft, and anti-espionage. Therefore, it is now urgently necessary to strengthen the leadership of factory protection work and improve and establish factory security committees. The committee should be under the leadership of the factory management committee, and should be composed of administrative heads, party branch secretaries, security officers or committee members, trade union directors, security captains, etc., with the administrative head serving as the chairman. The establishment of this institution should not be a formality, but should truly undertake the task of factory security work. At the same time, implement a strict system of responsibility at all levels. Factory administrative personnel and engineering personnel should conduct careful and strict inspections and be responsible for the safety equipment of the project. In the workshop, implement a shift handover inspection system to clarify responsibilities. Establish and improve necessary organizations for fire prevention, anti-espionage, and anti-theft, and select capable cadres to strengthen their daily leadership in order to protect the people's property.

Third, inspect and replenish our fire-fighting equipment. At present, the fire-fighting equipment in most factories is incomplete. After the fire in the laboratory of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, some of the factory's fire-fighting equipment, such as fire hoses, needed to be repaired, and some needed to be purchased, but they have not yet been repaired or purchased. Most of the fire-fighting equipment in the Machine General Factory is incomplete. Trade union cadres suggested purchasing it, but the administration not only did not adopt it, but also considered it a nuisance. A branch factory bought fire extinguishers and locked them in the warehouse, and the administration arbitrarily canceled the security team. In some factories, the leadership of the fire brigade is lax and the technology is not skilled. In the event of a fire, it is difficult to exert the proper role. At present, all factories should conduct a thorough inspection of fire-fighting equipment. Those that need to be replenished should be quickly replenished and repaired. Firefighters should be constantly trained to improve their skills, and a system of responsibility should be implemented. In addition to strengthening their political and technical education on weekdays, they should also be supplemented with clear rewards and punishments. Personnel who neglect their duties must be given appropriate punishment, and those who are loyal to their duties and meritorious should be commended and rewarded.

In short, strengthening factory security work and effectively protecting the property of the people's motherland is an extremely important task, and it is of utmost importance to the current restoration and development of production. We must use all effective methods to prevent theft, fire, and espionage, ensure that incidents that harm the people's property no longer continue to occur, and ensure the victorious completion of the national economic construction cause.

It is hoped that the above-mentioned points will be thoroughly discussed and studied by trade union cadres and administrative cadres in all factories, as well as by all employees, members and non-members, and that effective methods will be specifically formulated to effectively prevent the occurrence of fires and sabotage incidents.

    企业局、市总工会指示各厂
    警惕麻痹松弛
    加强防火防特
    【本市讯】本市人民政府企业局与市职工总会筹委会，顷向各工厂发出关于加强工厂保卫工作的指示，全文如下：
    自四月间中国共产党北平市委会发出建立公营工厂保卫工作的指示后，至今已经两个多月，在此期间，除少数工厂干部已开始重视这一工作，并作出了具体计划和布置，收到了一定的效果外（如清河制呢厂由于防火设备较完善，七月七日上午机房发生火灾即时扑灭），大部干部对它仍存在着严重的麻痹、轻视思想，对工厂保卫工作的重要性，没有足够的认识，因而各厂失火失盗事件，近来仍不断发生。继电车公司、石景山钢铁厂失火后，门头沟煤矿公司与西山煤矿接连发生火灾和火药库爆炸，被服厂发生了棉花燃烧等事件。总计半年来全市工厂中，发生火灾者竟达二十一起之多，使国家财产遭到巨大损失！
    造成这些失火的原因：一是工厂某些行政人员，工会干部不负责任，管理不严，防备不周，纪律松弛。二是职工们警惕性不高，主动积极保卫工厂的建议和行动做得很不够。三是国民党特务匪徒的阴谋破坏。针对这些严重现象，我们对以后可能发生的类似事件，必须采取有效的办法，予以防止。
    继续学习文件  克服官僚主义
    为此，我们必须：第一，在工人和工厂一切干部中，经常进行保卫国家财产，扑灭匪特的教育。六月中旬和七月初，市总工会先后指示各工厂，学习华北人民政府对于石景山钢铁厂失火事件的处理和通令，及新华社短论“保卫人民祖国的财产”，“消灭麻痹倾向，扑灭特务匪徒”等文件，但不少工厂干部，自己既不学习这些文件，又不向工人进行宣传解释，对市总工会，关于这一方面的指示，不加研究，不严格执行，这是一种严重的无组织，无纪律现象。
    目前各工厂行政干部与工会干部，仍要继续学习前所指示的两文件，并在全体职工中进行广泛的宣传动员，使大家认识到保护国家财产，是每一个职工神圣的职责，动员工厂所有干部及职工与漠视浪费或损害国家财产者作坚决的斗争。如果我们不向工厂管理中这些恶劣的官僚主义进攻，我们要完全避免工厂遭受损失是不可能的。
    不仅如此，“我们必须号召全体职工提高警惕，防范特务匪徒的破坏”。毛主席告诫我们：在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然要和我们做拼死的斗争。过去有些地方，特务匪徒所以能够达到破坏的目的，均由于我们某些干部在思想上，行动上，麻痹不仁玩忽职守，甚而敌我不分所致。今后敌人一定还会利用我们的弱点，进行破坏与捣乱，我们必须提高警惕性，严格防止破坏事件发生。
    健全保卫工作组织  检查充实消防设备
    第二
    健全与建立我们工厂保卫工作的组织。据调查：全市区三十多个工厂中，至六月二十日成立了工厂保卫委员会的只有八个，其中有的工厂敷衍了事，将防空组织换了个名字。组织纠察队尤为混乱不堪，因而参加者有未经审查的国民党员，有混进工厂不久的散兵游勇，且有将旧警卫队，未加改造和教育，即变为纠察队，所以纠察队的成份复杂，是不可能负起或完成防火、防盗、防特的任务的。因此，目前急需加强工厂保护工作的领导，健全与建立工厂保卫委员会。该委员会应设在工厂管理委员会领导之下，由行政负责人、党的支部书记、保卫干事或委员、工会主任、保卫队长等共同组成，行政负责人任主任委员。这一机构成立后，并不应是一个形式的，而真正要担负工厂保卫工作的任务。同时实行严格的按级负责制，工厂行政人员与工程人员，谨慎严密进行检查，负责工程安全设备。在工房中，实行上下班接交检查制度，以明职责。建立与健全防火、防特、防盗等必要组织，选拔得力干部，加强其日常领导，以保卫人民财产。
    第三、检查与充实我们的消防设备。目前各工厂消防设备多不完善，石景山钢铁厂化验室失火后，该厂消防用具水龙带，有的需要修理，有的需要购置，但至今仍未修理或购置。机器总厂防火设备大部残缺，工会干部建议购置，行政上不但未予采纳，且认为是找麻烦。分厂买了消火器销在仓库里，行政上擅自取消保卫队。有的工厂消防队领导松驰，技术不熟，遇到失火，甚难发挥应有的作用。目前各厂应切实检查一次消防设备，有些需要补充的，就应该赶快补充修理，对于消防队员，应经常加紧训练，使其技术熟练，并实行负责制，除平日加强其政治与技术教育外，亦需辅之以严明的赏罚，对玩忽职务的人员，必须给以适当处罚，对尽忠职守有功者，给以表扬奖励。
    总之，加强工厂保卫工作，切实保护人民祖国的财产，是一项极其重要的工作，它对目前恢复与发展生产上有着极其重要的意义。我们必须用一切有效的办法，进行防盗、防火、防特，保证危害人民财产的事件不再继续发生，保证国家经济建设事业的胜利完成。
    以上所指示各点，望各工厂工会干部与行政干部，及全体职工会员与非会员，深入进行讨论研究，并具体订出有效办法，切实防止失火破坏事件的发生。
