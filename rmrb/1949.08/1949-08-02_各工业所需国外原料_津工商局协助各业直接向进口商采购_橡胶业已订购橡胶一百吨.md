    Foreign Raw Materials Needed by Various Industries
    Tianjin Industry and Commerce Bureau Assists Industries in Purchasing Directly from Importers
    Rubber Industry Orders 100 Tons of Rubber
    [Tianjin Dispatch] In order to help solve the problem of foreign raw materials needed by some industries, the Tianjin Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau has begun to organize various industries to purchase directly from importers in order to reduce production costs. At present, the industries that have decided to participate in collective procurement include rubber, dyes, matches, machinery, dyeing and weaving, electrical equipment, glassware, and leather making, a total of eight industries. An agreement has been reached with the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese importer, Ocean Enterprise Company, on the ordering method. The price of the goods is calculated based on the Hong Kong price plus various donations, taxes, and freight. Payment is made in full at the exchange rate of the day when the contract is signed (foreign exchange is self-provided or sought by the importer on behalf of the buyer, and the transaction is guaranteed by both parties through a state-designated bank) and the goods are delivered within the specified date. The price of ordering according to this method is much lower than the market price. The first batch is that the Rubber Industry Association has ordered 100 tons of rubber from the company, and other industries will continue to sign contracts.

    橡胶业已订购橡胶一百吨
    【天津专电】津市工商局为协助解决部分工业所需国外原料问题，着手组织各业直接向进口商采购，以减低生产成本。现决定参加集体采购者，已有橡胶、染料、火柴、机器、染织、电工器材、料器、制革等八业，并与香港华侨进口商海洋企业公司商妥订货办法，货价按香港价格加各项捐税运费等计算，于订合同时按当日外汇牌价付清（外汇自备或由进口商代觅，由双方通过国家指定银行作保证）在规定日期内交货。按此项办法订货价格远较市价为低。现首批已有橡胶业公会向该公司订购橡胶一百吨，其他各业亦将继续签订合同。
