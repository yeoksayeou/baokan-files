Fellow Comrades:

This is the first time the Revolutionary Committee has freely and openly held a general membership meeting in a locality; the Beijing Municipal Branch is also the first local branch to be formally established according to new standards. Such gatherings are impossible to hold in areas still controlled by Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary clique, and they are also impossible to hold in imperialist colonies. The formal establishment of the Beijing Branch can be said to be an epoch-making beginning for the work of this committee. In the past, the government was the government of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary clique, the government of landlords, bureaucrats, and compradors. Our central task was to weaken the power of the reactionary clique and undermine the rule of the reactionary government. From now on, the government is the people's government and also our own government. We must do our best to consolidate it and assist it in carrying out various reforms. In the past, we feared that the Chiang family's regime would not be chaotic enough. No matter who it was (of course, we also distinguished between them, but the standards were quite loose), as long as they were willing to disrupt the rule of the reactionary clique and work for the Revolutionary Committee, we encouraged them and contacted them. Therefore, it was inevitable that good and bad were mixed together, and many loopholes emerged. From now on, we must require that the first member meet certain standards in terms of understanding and action, and we must carefully select members.

Some of our comrades, in the past in areas under reactionary rule, were able to carry out revolutionary work seriously, regardless of the danger to their lives and property, and made contributions to the people's democratic revolutionary front. This is worthy of everyone's respect. At the same time, it should not be concealed that among all the members in the past, there were three different types of people. The first type were those who understood the principles, clearly recognized the path to be taken, and were determined to embark on it; the second type were simply anti-Chiang elements, who only resented the bad policies of the Chiang Kai-shek government, but were vague about the foundation of the reactionary clique, the source of the bad policies, and the future of the Chinese revolution; the third type were those who saw that the Chiang regime was in imminent danger, and in order to secure their own future, secretly established some connections with the revolutionary side, that is, the so-called opportunists. The first type of comrades should assume the responsibility of leading work and leading study. The second type of comrades have a sense of justice, but their understanding is unclear; they may have made progress after being educated by the facts in recent years; they should be encouraged to study and helped to study. For the third type, their actions in recent years should be carefully examined. If it is found that they have committed acts that are unacceptable to the public, they should not be registered when preparing anew. We admit that a person may become enlightened and may rehabilitate themselves, but this is a matter for the future, let's see how they perform in the future.

To establish a cause, one must be "cautious at the beginning." The Beijing Branch is the first to be prepared anew. We hope that it will serve as a model for future branches in various places. Therefore, the preparatory process of the Beijing Branch has really taken a lot of time and energy of the comrades, and the selection of members has been very careful. If the branches in various places are organized very rigorously and the entire Revolutionary Committee is made very sound, serving the people will not be empty words but will be effective.

II

The outline of the Kuomintang's sixty-year history is roughly as follows: From 1886 to 1911, from the Xingzhonghui to the Tongmenghui, the members of the organization were entirely revolutionary elements, led by the revolutionary Mr. Sun, standing on the revolutionary side, and fighting against the Manchu Dynasty and the reactionary representatives of the feudal gentry, the Royalist Party; this struggle was victorious. After the Xinhai Revolution, there were already progressive and conservative factions within the party, but the leadership of the party was always in the hands of the progressive faction headed by Mr. Sun, still standing on the revolutionary side and fighting against the bureaucratic warlords; this struggle can also be considered a victory. In 1927, the leadership of the party completely fell into the hands of the counter-revolutionary faction, and the Kuomintang became a counter-revolutionary party, suppressing the revolutionary forces for more than 20 years. As a result, it was overthrown by the revolutionary united front led by the Chinese Communist Party. In a nutshell, it arose from revolution and perished from counter-revolution. This history warns us that a political group that becomes an obstacle to the development of human society cannot exist.

The Kuomintang has been led to the grave by the party's counter-revolutionary faction, namely the Chiang Kai-shek clique. What exists is only the Kuomintang's revolutionary faction, namely the Revolutionary Committee. The establishment of the Revolutionary Committee has gone through many twists and turns and has been brewing for a long time. When the counter-revolutionary faction seized the leadership of the party in 1927 and began to abandon the two major tasks of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism and betray the three major policies, there were revolutionary factions within the party who opposed such absurd measures, such as Comrades Soong Ching Ling, He Xiangning, and Deng Yanda. But at that time, the vast majority of Kuomintang members, especially those at the upper levels, were confused, and the revolutionary faction was very isolated. After Chiang Kai-shek's vigorous dictatorship, which harmed the people and the country, and after the "September 18th Incident," a part of the comrades gradually awakened their awareness of anti-feudalism and anti-imperialism, and the weight of the revolutionary faction increased. At that time, the struggle between the revolutionary faction and the counter-revolutionary faction took "resistance to Japan" as the main weapon. The former called for resistance to Japan, and the latter advocated surrender and compromise to Japan. The Songhu Resistance of the 19th Route Army, the Chahar Resistance of the Northwest Army, the establishment of the Fujian People's Government, and the National Revolutionary League organized later in Hong Kong, as well as the Xi'an Incident of December 12, which promoted resistance to Japan, were all practical actions of the revolutionary faction. Although these revolutionary actions won the sympathy of patriotic people, they did not combine with the masses of the people, nor did they have a clear political line. At the same time, there were wavering and even traitorous elements within the organization, which was a great shortcoming and also the reason for failure. During the eight years after the people of the whole country promoted the situation of resistance to Japan, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique oppressed the people, eliminated dissidents, and attacked anti-Japanese elements at all times. Our comrades of the revolutionary faction, scattered in various places, had long been communicating with each other, wanting to reorganize the progressive elements of the party. As a result, the comrades in Chongqing brewed the Three People's Principles Comrades Association, and the comrades in Guilin brewed the Chinese Kuomintang Democratic Promotion Association. Supported by American imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique tore up the resolutions of the Old Political Consultative Conference and the Kuomintang-Communist truce agreement, and launched a nationwide counter-revolutionary civil war. The objective situation required our revolutionary faction to further unite, and thus brewed the Revolutionary Committee, which included the Democratic League, the Democratic Promotion Association, and other progressive elements.

In the scope of the Kuomintang, the revolutionary faction was victorious and the counter-revolutionary faction was defeated; in the national scope, the revolutionary front was victorious and the counter-revolutionary front was defeated. However, without the revolutionary united front led by the Chinese Communist Party, it would have been impossible to defeat the counter-revolutionary rule; if our revolutionary faction had not participated in the revolutionary united front, it would have been impossible to achieve its own victory. This revolutionary united front that defeated the Chiang Kai-shek clique can be said to have started with the "Call for All Parties, Factions, and Compatriots Throughout the Country to Jointly Resist Japan and Save the Country" issued by the CPC Central Committee on August 1, 1935. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the CPC put forward "Persist in Resistance, Persist in Progress, Persist in Unity," which won the sympathy of people across the country who understood the principles and had a sense of justice. At the same time, it was able to implement Mr. Mao Zedong's line of "Developing Progressive Forces, Winning Over Intermediate Forces, and Isolating Stubborn Forces," and the united front developed. From before and after the Old Political Consultative Conference, various democratic parties and democratic personages gradually openly supported the CPC in opposing the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and the united front became even more powerful. After the test of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's destruction of the Old Political Consultative Conference, the united front became even stronger. In short, this united front was in fact initiated by the CPC and has always been led by the CPC.

In the past, the Revolutionary Committee worked hard in the united front for common goals and achieved the goal of overthrowing the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary rule; from now on, we should more excitedly do our best in the united front to achieve the goal of building a new China.

　　中国国民党革命委员会
  　今后努力的方向
    八月十四日在中国国民党革命委员会北平市分会成立大会报告
    李济深
    一各位同志：
    革命委员会在一个地方自由地公开地举行会员大会，今天还是第一次；根据新的标准而正式成立的地方分会，北平市分会还是第一个。在仍在蒋介石反动集团控制的地区，不可能举行这样的集会；在帝国主义的殖民地，也不可能举行这样的集会。北平分会的正式成立，可说是本会工作的划时代的开始。在过去，政府是蒋介石反动集团的政府，是地主、官僚、买办的政府，我们的中心工作是削弱反动集团的力量，破坏反动政府的统治；今后，政府是人民的同时也是自己的政府，我们要尽其智能来巩固它，协助它进行种种兴革。在过去，我们惟恐蒋家天下不乱，不管什么人（我们对于他们当然也有分别，不过尺度放得颇宽罢了），只要他愿意捣乱反动集团的统治，愿意为革命委员会工作，就鼓励他，和他联络；因此就免不了好的坏的参杂其间，出了许多漏洞。今后我们必须要求第一个会员在认识上和行动上达到一定的标准，必须郑重选择会员。
    我们有一部分同志，以前在反动统治的区域里，能够不怕生命财产的危险，认真地进行革命工作，对人民民主革命阵线有所贡献，这是值得大家敬重的。同时亦不该讳言，在过去已有的全体会员中，存在着三类不同的人。第一类是明白事理，认识清楚应走的道路而决心走上应走的道路的；第二类是单纯的反蒋者，他们只是愤恨蒋介石政府的恶政，但对于反动集团的基础，恶政的根源，和中国革命的前途等等是模糊的；第三类是看见了蒋政权岌岌可危，为了个人将来的出路，因而暗中和革命方面建立一点关系的人，即所谓投机分子。第一类同志应该负起领导做事和领导学习的责任。第二类同志正义之感是有的，只是认识不清；这几年受了事实的教育，可能有了进步；应该鼓励他们学习，帮助他们学习。对于第三类，应该慎重检查他们近几年来的行动，如果发现他有为众议所不容的事迹，从新筹备的时候就不予登记。我们承认一个人可能觉悟、可能自新，但这是以后的事，看他今后的表现如何再说吧。
    建立一件事业，必须“慎之于始”。北平分会是首先从新筹备的，我们希望它对将来的各地分会起示范的作用，因此北平分会的筹备过程，实在费了同志们不少的时间和精力，对于会员的选择是慎之又慎的。把各地的分会都搞得很严整，整个革命委员会搞得很健全，为人民服务就不会是一句空言而是有效果的了。
    二
    六十年的国民党历史的轮廓大致是这样的：一八八六年至一九一一年，兴中会至同盟会，组织的分子完全是革命分子，由革命的孙先生领导，站在革命方面，和满清皇朝及反革命的代表封建士大夫的保皇党斗争；这一斗争是胜利了。辛亥革命以后，党内已有进步的和保守的两派，但党的领导权一直操在以孙先生为首的进步派手上，仍然是站在革命方面，和官僚军阀斗争，这一斗争也算是胜利了。到了一九二七年，党的领导权完全落在反革命派手中，国民党就变成反革命的党，压迫革命势力二十多年，结果是被中国共产党领导的革命统一战线打倒了。一言以蔽之，兴起于革命，灭亡于反革命。这段历史警惕我们，一个政治团体而成为人类社会发展的障碍，就无法存在。
    国民党已被党的反革命派即蒋介石集团领导到坟墓去了，存在的只是国民党的革命派即革命委员会。革命委员会的成立，是经过许多曲折，经过长久酝酿的。当一九二七年反革命派掌握了党的领导权，开始放弃反帝国主义和反封建两大任务，背叛三大政策的时候，党内就有反对这种荒谬措施的革命派，如宋庆龄、何香凝、邓演达等同志。但那时候的国民党人，尤其是上层分子，绝对大多数是糊涂的，革命派很孤立。经过了蒋介石的厉行独裁，殃民祸国，经过了“九一八”，才逐渐唤起了一部分同志的反封建反帝国主义的意识，才增加了革命派的分量。那时候，革命派和反革命派的斗争，以“抗日”为主要的武器，前者是号召对日抗战的，后者是对日投降妥协的。十九路军的淞沪抗战，西北军的察哈尔抗战，福建人民政府的成立与以后在香港组织的民族革命同盟，以及促进抗战的双十二西安事变，都是革命派的实际行动。这几次革命行动虽取得了爱国人士的同情，但没有和人民大众相结合，也没有明确的政治路线，同时内部又存在着动摇甚至叛变的分子，实在是很大的缺点，也就是失败的原因。全国人民促成对日抗战的局面以后整整的八年间，蒋介石反动集团时时刻刻在压迫人民，排除异己，打击抗日分子。我们革命派散居在各地的同志，早就互通声气，要重新组织党的进步分子。结果在重庆的同志酝酿成了三民主义同志联合会，在桂林的同志酝酿成了中国国民党民主促进会。蒋介石反动集团在美帝国主义支持之下，撕毁旧政协的决议和国共停战协定，发动全国规模的反革命内战，客观的局势要求我们革命派进一步的团结，于是酝酿成了包括民联、民进和其它进步分子的革命委员会。
    在国民党的范围来说，革命派是胜利了，反革命派是失败了；在全国范围来说，革命阵线是胜利了，反革命阵线是失败了。然而没有中国共产党领导的革命统一战线，就不可能打败反革命的统治；如果我们革命派不是参加革命统一战线，也不可能获得自己的胜利。这打败蒋介石集团的革命统一战线，可说是开端于一九三五年八月一日中共中央的“各党各派及全国同胞共同抗日救国”的号召。抗战期间，中共提出“坚持抗战，坚持进步，坚持团结”，取得了全国明白事理和有正义感的人们的同情，同时又能执行毛泽东先生的“发展进步势力、争取中间势力、孤立顽固势力”的路线，统一战线就发展起来了。从旧政协的前后起，各民主党派和民主人士，逐渐公开地支持中共反对蒋介石集团，统一战线就更表现得有力了。经过蒋介石集团摧毁旧政协的考验，统一战线就更加强固了。总而言之，这统一战线事实上是由中共发起并一直是由中共领导的。
    革命委员会过去在统一战线中为共同的目标而努力，达到了打倒蒋介石反动统治的目的；今后应该更兴奋地在统一战线中尽我们的能力，以求达到建设新中国的目的。
