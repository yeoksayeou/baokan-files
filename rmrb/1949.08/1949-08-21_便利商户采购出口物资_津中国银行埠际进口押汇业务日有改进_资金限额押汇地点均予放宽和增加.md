　　To Facilitate Merchant Procurement of Export Goods
  　Tianjin Bank of China Improves Inter-City Import Pledge Business Daily
    Funding Limits and Pledge Locations are Relaxed and Increased
    [Tianjin News] The inter-city import pledge business of the Bank of China in Tianjin has been improving daily. Regarding pledge locations, initially there was only Zhangjiakou, but recently Jinan, Tangshan, and Beiping have been added. Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Shanghai, and other locations are also preparing to undertake this business in the near future. All export goods and domestically sold mountain products can be handled. On the 16th, Tangshan's import pledge began, with the first transaction being for the Hebei Egg Factory to purchase fresh eggs in Tangshan, with a purchase certificate amount of 30 million yuan. Furthermore, in order to truly protect the interests of customers, the Bank of China has agreed with banks in the producing areas to immediately notify them by telegram when the goods are loaded onto the train for shipment. Upon receiving the telegram, the Bank of China will contact the borrower to go to the station to negotiate the pickup of the goods, so as to avoid delays in storing the goods at the station, which would increase the borrower's warehousing costs and make them vulnerable to rain or other unexpected losses. Regarding transportation insurance, initially, due to the property insurance company's coverage limit of only 7.8 million yuan per train, the amount of loans and the quantity of transportation were partially restricted. Later, according to the current actual situation, the Bank of China temporarily stipulated that: for borrowers with loans below 7.8 million yuan, the full insured amount should be insured; for those above 7.8 million yuan, only 7.8 million yuan should be insured, and the borrower should provide a letter declaring full self-insurance. Regarding the import pledge funds in various locations, the initial quotas set by each bank were too small and felt insufficient; now the Bank of China has reported to the branch, and it may soon be decided to increase them. Furthermore, in order to more effectively support exports, when export manufacturers plan to go to production areas outside the aforementioned import pledge locations to purchase export goods, the bank can still provide loans in the form of raw goods pledge (export manufacturers who purchase goods in import pledge locations can also voluntarily borrow money in the form of pledge loans). That is, the manufacturer provides full collateral locally (Tianjin), obtains the funds, and carries them to the production area to purchase goods. After the goods are transported to Tianjin, the original collateral is exchanged. For this type of pledge loan, the borrower can provide transportation documents, and the term can be appropriately extended depending on the distance of the journey. It is believed that after the implementation of this method, it will play a greater role in promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. Under the above circumstances, as of the 16th, the Bank of China has continued to make import pledges totaling 90 million yuan, and is in negotiations (in Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, Jinan, and other places) for approximately 300 million yuan or more.

　　便利商户采购出口物资
  　津中国银行埠际进口押汇业务日有改进
    资金限额押汇地点均予放宽和增加
    【天津讯】本市中国银行埠际进口押汇业务，已日有改进。关于押汇地点，最初原有张家口一处，新近增加济南、唐山、北平三地。石家庄、保定、上海等地也准备在近期内陆续承作。凡出口物资及内销山货，皆可办理。十六日唐山进押已开始做出，第一笔为河北蛋厂，赴唐收购鲜蛋，购买证金额三千万元。中行又为了切实维护客户利益，经与产区银行约定，在货物装车起运时，立即以电报通知，中行接电后即联系借户计时赴站洽提货物，以免货物存站耽搁，徒增借户栈租负担，且易遭受雨淋或其他意外损失。关于运输保险问题，初期由于产物保险公司承保险额每列车只限七百八十万元，部分的限制了贷款的数额和运输数量，后来中行根据目前实际情况，暂时规定了：凡借款额在七百八十万元以下者，应保足保额，在七百八十万元以上者即按七百八十万元投保，另由借户具函声明自保全额。关于各地进口押汇资金，当初各行所订额度太小，感觉不敷应用；现中行已向分行报告，不久或即可确定增加。又该行为更有力的扶持出口，凡出口厂商拟赴前开进押地点以外之产区收购出口物资时，该行可仍按生货押款方式先予贷款（在进押地点收购物资的出口厂商自愿照押款方式借款时，也可），即由厂商在当地（天津）提供十足押品，押得款项，自行携至产区收购，俟货物运抵津后，再行预换原押品。此种押款得由借户提供运输证明文件，视途程远近将期限酌予放长。相信此种办法推行后，对于推动城乡物资交流上，将起有更大作用。在以上情况下，截至十六日为止，中行已续作进押共计九千万元，正在接洽的（张家口、唐山、济南等地）约在三亿元以上。
