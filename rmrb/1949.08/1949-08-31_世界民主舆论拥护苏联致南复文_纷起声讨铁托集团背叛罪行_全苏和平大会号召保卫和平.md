　　Following the Soviet government's publication on the 11th of a reply exposing the Tito government of Yugoslavia's despicable behavior of surrendering to the imperialist bloc and engaging in anti-Soviet double-dealing, it published on the 18th a reply to the Tito government regarding the illegal arrest of Soviet citizens, further revealing the Tito clique's crime of "abandoning the democratic and socialist camp and throwing itself into the international capitalist camp," and exposing the essence of the current regime in Yugoslavia controlled by the Tito clique—a fascist secret police reign of terror. The reply expressed intolerance towards the Tito government's atrocities of persecuting Soviet citizens in Yugoslavia, and declared that it "will be forced to take other necessary and effective measures to protect the rights and interests of Soviet citizens residing in Yugoslavia and to prevent those unscrupulous fascist saboteurs from acting rashly." A series of past facts fully proves the correctness of the Soviet reply's exposure of the Tito clique's betrayal. The Tito clique has degenerated into a pawn of imperialism. It does not hesitate to supply strategic materials such as copper, chromium, and antimony from Yugoslavia to imperialism for war preparations, secretly negotiate with Britain to sell Slovenia's Carinthia, openly help the Athenian royalist fascist army attack the Greek democratic army, violate the Albanian border, conduct espionage and sabotage activities in people's democratic countries, and arrest and massacre supporters of socialism in Yugoslavia on a large scale, arresting and persecuting Soviet citizens in Yugoslavia. All this shows that the Tito clique has joined forces with Spain's Franco and the Greek royalist fascists, carrying out the tasks of imperialist agents. After the publication of the Soviet reply, democratic people all over the world expressed their support and condemned the Tito clique's betrayal of faith. The public opinion circles and the broad masses of people in democratic China also echoed in unison, with newspapers and magazines in Peiping, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou and other places publishing comments on the matter. The People's Daily editorial in Peiping on the 27th pointed out: "The Soviet government's note is an important contribution to safeguarding world peace and an important education to the people of the world." The development of events over the past year fully proves the correctness of the Cominform's resolution on the Yugoslav issue. "This historical fact has educated the Chinese working class and other classes in the Chinese democratic movement. The logical development fully proves the instructions of the great people's leader Chairman Mao: 'Chinese people must either lean to the side of imperialism or to the side of socialism; there is no exception. Sitting on the fence is not possible, and there is no third road.' Anti-imperialism requires alliance with the Soviet Union, and anti-Sovietism inevitably leads to imperialism. The nonsense of 'independently practicing socialism' spread by Tito is completely a shameless deception of counterrevolution." We believe that the heroic Yugoslav people will further recognize the true face of the Tito regime from the Soviet note, and increase their confidence and strength to realize their legitimate aspirations: to replace the leadership of the Tito clique and return Yugoslavia to the socialist and democratic camp.
　　Simultaneous with the ratification and entry into force of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, the movement to defend world peace is developing further. The All-Soviet Conference in Support of Peace was convened in Moscow on the 25th and successfully concluded on the 27th. Attending the conference were not only more than a thousand representatives of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, but also representatives from fourteen countries including China, Korea, Bulgaria, Romania, Italy, and the United States. The purpose of the conference was to strengthen the ties of all those who support peace and jointly oppose the bloody plans of the instigators of a new war. The participants of the conference solemnly declared: The Soviet people support peace and oppose war; but they are not afraid of the enemies of peace, and neither atomic bombs nor any other kind of intimidation can scare them. They firmly believe that the peace camp has the power to avoid war. The conference also issued a declaration calling on peace advocates in all countries to have courage and believe in their own strength, and tirelessly unite the ranks of people of all countries who are fighting for peace, and to use their strong intervention to dissolve the forces of aggression. The declaration pointed out with confidence: The joint efforts of peace-loving people all over the world will eventually be victorious.

### 世界民主舆论拥护苏联致南复文　纷起声讨铁托集团背叛罪行  全苏和平大会号召保卫和平

　　世界民主舆论拥护苏联致南复文
  　纷起声讨铁托集团背叛罪行
    全苏和平大会号召保卫和平
    苏联政府在十一日发表复文，揭发南斯拉夫铁托政府投降帝国主义集团并进行反苏的两面派手腕的卑劣行为以后，又于十八日发表致铁托政府关于非法逮捕苏联公民的照会复文，进一步揭露了铁托集团“背弃民主和社会主义阵营而投入国际资本主义阵营”的罪行，揭穿了铁托集团所把持的南斯拉夫现政权的本质——法西斯秘密警察的恐怖统治。复文对铁托政府迫害南境苏联公民的暴行表示不能容忍，并声明“将被迫采取其他必需而有效的措施，以保卫侨居南斯拉夫的苏联公民的权益，并使那些肆无忌惮的法西斯破坏者不敢轻举妄动”。过去一连串事实，完全证明苏联复文所揭发的铁托集团叛变的正确性。铁托集团已堕落为帝国主义的走卒。它不惜把南斯拉夫的铜、铬、锑等战略原料供给帝国主义作备战之用，与英国秘密谈判出卖斯洛文族加林西亚，公开帮助雅典保皇法西斯军进攻希腊民主军，侵犯阿尔巴尼亚边境，在人民民主国家内进行特务破坏活动，在国内大肆逮捕和屠杀南斯拉夫社会主义的拥护者，逮捕和迫害南斯拉夫境内的苏联公民。这一切说明铁托集团已与西班牙佛朗哥与希腊保皇法西斯同流合污，执行帝国主义代理人的任务。苏联复文发表以后，全世界民主人民一致表示拥护，并纷起声讨铁托集团的背信弃义。民主中国的舆论界和广大阶层的人民也都同声响应，北平、上海、天津、汉口等地的报章杂志都对此事发表评论。二十七日北平人民日报社论指出：“苏联的照会对保卫世界和平是一个重要的贡献，对全世界人民是一个重要的教育。”一年来事变的发展，完全证明欧洲共产党情报局关于南共问题决议的正确。“这一历史事实教育了中国工人阶级以及中国民主运动中其他阶级。逻辑的发展完全证明了伟大人民领袖毛主席的指示：‘中国人不是倒向帝国主义一边，就是倒向社会主义一边，绝无例外。骑墙是不行的，第三条道路是没有的。’反帝就必须联苏，反苏必然投向帝国主义。铁托所散布的‘单独实行社会主义’的鬼话，完全是反革命的无耻欺骗。”我们相信，英勇的南斯拉夫人民定将从苏联照会中更进一步认清铁托政权的真面目，并且增加他们的信心和力量，去实现他们的正当愿望：撤换铁托集团的领导，而使南斯拉夫重新回到社会主义和民主阵营里来。
    和侵略性的北大西洋公约批准和生效同时，保卫世界和平的运动正进一步地发展，全苏拥护和平大会已于二十五日在莫斯科召开并已于二十七日胜利闭幕。出席大会的不仅有代表着苏联各民族人民的一千多名代表，而且还有中、鲜、保、罗、意、美等十四国代表。大会的目的，是要加强一切拥护和平人们的联系，共同反对新战争挑拨者的血腥计划。大会参加者庄严的宣告：苏联人民拥护和平、反对战争；但是他们并不害怕和平的敌人，原子弹或其他任何种类的吓诈都吓不倒他们。他们坚信和平阵营有力量避免战争。大会并发表宣言，号召世界各国的和平拥护者要有勇气，并相信自己的力量，不倦的团结为和平而斗争的各国人民的队伍，以他们强有力的干涉，来消解侵略的力量。宣言充满信心地指出：全世界拥护和平的人们的共同努力，终将获得胜利。
