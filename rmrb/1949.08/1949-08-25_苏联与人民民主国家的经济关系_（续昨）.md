　　Economic Relations Between the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
  　(Continued from yesterday)
    M. Baromov
    Trading with the Soviet Union also brings other substantial benefits. The Soviet Union has on several occasions purchased goods from the People's Democratic countries at prices lower than world market prices. For example, Czechoslovakia purchased 600,000 tons of grain from the Soviet Union, saving 1.35 billion crowns (Czech currency), equivalent to 27 million US dollars.
    The Bulgarian "Workers' Daily" commented on this year's barter agreement, pointing out that maintaining prices at the 1948 level was extremely beneficial to Bulgaria, because the world market price of some of the goods Bulgaria purchased from the Soviet Union at that time had already risen, while the world market price of agricultural products exported by Bulgaria to the Soviet Union had fallen, and some agricultural products could not even find buyers in other markets.
    Finally, and equally importantly, trading with the Soviet Union has the advantage of not requiring expenditure in gold. Gold has today become a powerful weapon for the United States in pursuing expansion. Transactions between the People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union generally do not require foreign exchange, because the goods exchanged between the two sides are equal in value.
    Under the aforementioned circumstances, it is not surprising that the trade volume between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries is increasing year by year. This year, the trade turnover between the Soviet Union and Romania will be two and a half times that of 1948. Trade between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia has already increased by 45 percent this year, and trade with Bulgaria has increased by 20 percent (not including the industrial equipment Bulgaria purchased from the Soviet Union). Trade between the Soviet Union and Hungary will be double the total volume of 1948. Moreover, not only has the total trade volume increased, but the variety of goods has also increased – the Soviet Union is currently shipping to the People's Democratic countries the industrial equipment and raw materials they need most.

    Historically, the trade relations between the small countries of Central and Southeastern Europe developed on the following basis: the geographical proximity of these countries, their economic structures, and their possession of complementary raw material resources. However, between the two world wars, these trade relations were gradually weakened and destroyed. Germany, the United States, Britain, and France engaged in a fierce competition in these countries, disrupting and destroying the economic relations that had developed between these countries over centuries.
    The rule of capitalists and landlords in the People's Democratic countries has been eliminated, and the fundamental democratic reforms they have implemented have ended the abnormal estrangement between these countries. Economic cooperation between them is expanding. For example, in 1937, Czechoslovakia accounted for only 5 percent of Bulgaria's imports and 5.6 percent of its exports, while in 1947, these percentages were 15.8 percent and 18.9 percent respectively. Last year, the total trade volume between Poland and Czechoslovakia was 99.3 million US dollars, compared to 18.1 million US dollars in 1937.
    An important feature of the economic cooperation between the countries of the democratic camp is the mutual technical assistance provided by the countries in the process of industrialization. This assistance is of great significance for the progress of the young People's Democratic countries and the consolidation of their independence and sovereignty. The Soviet Union's assistance does not stem from the motive of making profits, has no intention of exploitation, and, needless to say, does not harbor any threat to the sovereignty and independence of these countries. This assistance is requested by the countries that need it and is by no means forced on others.
    Even the parts of their economic plans that mention foreign technical assistance are entirely formulated by the independent democratic countries themselves. For example, it may be recalled that when the United States proposed that Hungary's post-war reconstruction plan should be drafted by the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain, the Soviet government rejected this proposal. The Soviet government believed that the drafting of these plans was entirely a matter for the Hungarian government itself.

### 苏联与人民民主国家的经济关系　（续昨）

　　苏联与人民民主国家的经济关系
  　（续昨）
    Ｍ·巴罗莫夫
    和苏联作买卖还可以得到其他丰盛的利益。苏联有好几次让人民民主国家以低于世界市价的价格，由苏联购买货物。例如捷克由苏联购买六十万吨粮食，节省了十三亿五千万克鲁尼（捷币），等于二千七百万美元。
    保加利亚的“工人日报”评论今年的易货协定时指出，把价格维持在一九四八年的水平，对保加利亚极有利，因为那时保国由苏联购入的货物，有一部分其世界市价已经上涨了，而保国输至苏联的农产品，则其世界市价已经下跌了，甚至有些农产品在其他市场上已经完全找不到买主了。
    最后而且是同样重要的，是和苏联作买卖有这样的好处，即不必支出金元。金元今天已成为美国从事扩展的有力武器。各人民民主国家和苏联之间的交易，一般地可以不用外汇，因为双方互交的货物是相等的。
    在上述情形下，苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易量年年增长，是毫不奇怪的。今年苏联和罗马尼亚的贸易周转，将是一九四八年的二倍半。苏联和捷克的贸易，今年已经增加了百分之四十五，和保加利亚的贸易，已经增加了百分之二十（保加利亚从苏联购买的工业装备不算在内）。苏联和匈牙利的贸易，将是一九四八年总量的一倍。而且不仅贸易总量方面增长了，品类方面也增加了——苏联目前正运给人民民主国家它们所最需要的那些工业装备和原料。
    　　×  ×  ×  ×
    中欧和东南欧各小国间贸易关系，在历史上由下列的基础上发展起来的：各该国领土的接近，它们的经济结构，它们拥有互相补充的原料资源。但在两个世界大战之间，这个贸易关系一步步被削弱被破坏了。德国、美国、英国和法国在这些国家中进行着你死我活的竞争，搅乱着和破坏着这些国家之间几世纪以来发展起来的经济关系。
    各人民民主国家中的资本家和地主的统治已经被消灭，它们所实行的根本民主改革，已经结束了这些国家间反常的疏远。它们之间的经济合作正在扩展着。例如在一九三七年，捷克只占保加利亚的输入百分之五、输出百分之五·六，到了一九四七年，这些方面的百分比是百分之一五·八和百分之一八·九。去年波兰和捷克间的贸易总量是九千九百三十万美元，一九三七年是一千八百一十万美元。
    民主阵营各国经济合作的一个重要特点，是各国在实行工业化的过程中，在技术上互相帮助。这个帮助对于年青的人民民主国家的前进和它们的独立和主权的巩固，有很大的意义。苏联的帮助，不是从牟利的动机出发，毫无剥削的企图，同时，不消说，对各国的主权和独立不会怀有任何威胁。这个帮助是需要帮助的国家所要求的，决不是强迫别人接受的。
    甚至它们的经济计划中提到外国技术援助的部分，也完全是由自主的民主国家自己拟定的。例如，可以回忆一下，当美国提出匈牙利的战后复兴计划应由苏联、美国和英国草拟时，苏联政府拒绝美国这个提议。苏联政府认为，这些计划的草拟完全是匈牙利政府自己的事情。
