    Ping City University and Middle School Students' Summer Study Group
    Protests Against British Warship Crimes
    Vow to Avenge the Dead

    [Reported by this newspaper] The entire body of over two thousand students and staff of the Beiping University and Middle School Students' Summer Study Group issued a telegram protesting the crimes of the British warship HMS Amethyst, warning the British imperialists: the Chinese people will never forget April 20th and July 30th. The crimes of the HMS Amethyst must be punished, and the British government must bear full responsibility. The Chinese people are not to be insulted. Today the Chinese people have the determination and the strength to defend their people's motherland! Any imperialist crime will inevitably reap its own bitter fruit.
    The telegram calls on all compatriots to recognize the true face of imperialism, raise vigilance, and resolutely fight against domestic and foreign reactionaries! The telegram finally extends deep condolences to the soldiers and civilians who died in the two crimes of the HMS Amethyst, and vows to avenge the dead.
