    Peking University, Tsinghua University, Nankai University Freshmen
    Take Joint Entrance Exams Simultaneously in Beijing, Shanghai, and Five Other Cities
    Over Ten Thousand New Students Apply for Science, Engineering, Agriculture, and Medicine
    Teachers, Students, Workers, and Police Busy Serving at Beijing Exam Sites

[This Newspaper Reports] National Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University jointly held freshman entrance exams in the five regions of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Nanjing yesterday and today. The total number of applicants for the three universities is approximately over ten thousand; Shanghai has the most, with over five thousand, Beijing has over four thousand, and Nanjing and Tianjin have a combined total of two thousand (statistics for the Hankou region are not yet available). The three universities jointly administer the admissions process and provide the exam questions. The majority of applicants are for science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine, with a ratio of five to one compared to the liberal arts and law colleges.

Yesterday morning in the Beijing area, thousands of young men and women students, carrying stationery and books, faced the morning sun and headed to Tsinghua Garden and the Peking University campus by train, bicycle, and pedicab. The Candidate Service Committee, composed of teachers, students, workers, and police from both universities, was very active on campus. Welcome slogans posted throughout the campus encouraged candidates to "remain calm and face the challenge." Directional signs and maps helped candidates avoid getting lost. Numerous water tanks solved the problem of staying hydrated in the hot weather. Workers and students, not afraid of trouble, took care of more than a thousand parked vehicles. The lending station helped flustered candidates who forgot to bring ink or lost their admission tickets, offering them a lifeline. The aid station thoughtfully provided balms and Ten Drops medicine to candidates who were flushed and short of breath. The information desk kindly and patiently answered every question from the candidates. As soon as the bell rang to signal the end of the mathematics exam, thousands of concerned candidates saw the solutions to the exam questions appear on the democratic walls of both universities. The Tsinghua dining hall provided inexpensive meals for the examinees, and the Peking University Red Building had a free soybean milk supply station for the candidates' breakfast.

    北大清华南开三校新生
    平沪五地同时考试
    新生万人多考理工农医科
    平考场师生工警服务忙
    【本报讯】国立北京大学、清华大学、南开大学昨今两日联合在北平、上海、天津、汉口、南京五地区同时举行新生考试。三校报名人数共约一万余人；上海区最多，计五千余人，北平区四千余人，南京、天津共两千余人（汉口区尚无统计）。三校联合招生，分出试题。报名者以理、工、农、医等科占最大多数，与文法学院之比为五比一。
    北平区昨日清晨，数千男女青年学生手携文具书袋，迎着朝阳，分乘火车，自行车，三轮车奔赴清华园与沙滩北大。两校师生工警组成的考生服务委员会在校内大见活跃，遍贴于校内的欢迎标语鼓励考生“沉着应战”。指路标、平面图使考生不致迷惑方向。饮水缸很多，解决了热天喝水的困难。工友、同学不怕麻烦，照管了千余辆存车。借物处使心慌意乱忘了带墨水，丢了准考证的考生找到了救星。救护站关心地送给脸红气促的考生万金油和十滴水。问询处亲切耐心地答复考生每一个问题，当钟声当当数学考试下堂以后，两校民主墙上即出现了数千考生关心的试题解答。清华膳厅为投考同学供应廉价客饭，北大红楼有免费豆浆供给站作为考生早餐。
