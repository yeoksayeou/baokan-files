　　People's Bank of China Taiyuan Branch
  　Achieves Success in All Business Areas
    Absorbs Over 6.7 Billion Yuan in Deposits in Two Months, Supports Public and Private Enterprises, and Widely Establishes Remittance Locations
    [Taiyuan Telegraph] The People's Bank of China Taiyuan Branch achieved good results in managing finance, organizing deposits and loans, remittances, and sorting out old currencies in June and July. In the management of gold and silver over the past two months, a method combining administrative management and mass management was adopted, resulting in the capture of 452 gold and silver speculation offenders, confiscation of 174 taels of gold, 26,116 silver dollars, and the devaluation and exchange of 96 taels of gold and 10,083 silver dollars due to illegal activities. It mobilized most of the 32 private silver firms and jewelers to change careers, and three silver houses, including Jinxing, resumed business, granting preferential gold and silver exchange rates to those who resumed business or changed careers. In organizing deposits, loans, and remittances, it played a significant role in restoring production and promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. In two months, the total amount of deposits reached 6,764,400,000 yuan, and various loans totaling 567,226,100 yuan were issued (loans to public enterprises accounted for 96 percent of the total loans). The 1 million yuan handicraft loan issued in the city was mostly lent to the iron and woodworking industries. Of the 2.5 million yuan of draught animal loans issued in the suburbs, private capital has been combined to buy back 128 head of livestock. The branch has also widely established remittance relationships with large and small cities in various liberated areas, connecting with 11 locations including Pingjin, Beijing, and Shanghai for both telegraphic and postal remittances; and with 33 locations including Handan and Datong for postal remittances only. In June and July, a total of 538,920,000 yuan was remitted in, and 221,570,000 yuan was remitted out. Outward remittances were mostly used to purchase machine parts or medicinal materials and goods, while inward remittances were mostly funds allocated by public enterprises and institutions, with private capital accounting for only 11 percent. In the redemption of old currency, a total of 23,758,000 banknotes of Northwest, Southern Hebei, Beihai, and Border currencies were recovered in two months, totaling 127,546,600 yuan in Renminbi, which has unified the currency in circulation in the market. In the past two months, the Taiyuan People's Bank has implemented the loan policy of prioritizing public enterprises followed by private enterprises and handicrafts in its loan targets. Initially, loans were granted with low or no interest in principle, which played a significant role in stimulating production; in the future, it is preparing to appropriately increase interest rates to achieve mutual benefit for both the public and private sectors.
