We are currently in a period of intense study of "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" across various government departments and schools. We hope that everyone will send us the most debated questions and learning insights from your studies. We plan to select some of these for publication and discussion, in order to exchange learning experiences. We especially encourage contributions from comrades in Party Training Classes, Summer Study Groups, and Summer Academies.
