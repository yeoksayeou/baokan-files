    Imperialist Arrogance Remains Unchanged
    Briton Weiss Abuses Workers
    Kailuan Linxi Miners Protest in Anger
    Demanding Public Apology and Admission of Error
    [Tangshan, 31st dispatch] Weiss (transliteration), the British director of the Linxi Central Power Plant of the Kailuan Luan Mining Bureau, has been刁难abusing workers with an imperialist attitude and illegally resisting the military representative of the mine in the performance of his duties, arousing the indignation and protest of all the mine's workers. Since arriving at the Linxi Central Power Plant, Weiss has consistently treated workers with arrogance. After the liberation of Tangshan, he even arbitrarily issued a notice punishing workers for absenteeism (dated January 28th of this year), stipulating not only that workers who were absent for five days would have one day's wage deducted, but also that this would be retroactive to November of last year. He did not mention the fact that the mine was in arrears with wages, and that the workers were protecting the power plant and working hard to ensure production while enduring hunger, which has already caused great dissatisfaction among the workers. Weiss not only did not take this to heart, but then ordered workers to do the work that should have been done during their shifts after they got off work. For example, the No. 3 generator had to have its 舆瓦盖bearing caps removed every day to check for problems. Previously, it was disassembled in the morning and reassembled in the afternoon, but Weiss forced the workers to reassemble it after they got off work, forcing the workers to extend their working hours by 45 minutes every day before they could go home. The workers made three suggestions, requesting that it be done during the shift, but Weiss not only did not accept it, but forced the workers to do it unreasonably, threatening, "If you don't do it, I will report to the higher authorities that you are irresponsible." Once, because a worker was finishing up cleaning his equipment and washing his hands ten minutes before the end of his shift, Weiss called in Shen Huanran, a publicly recognized excellent foreman who had served Kailuan for more than 30 years, and scolded him severely. Foreman Shen was afraid of being reprimanded and did not dare to refute him. He returned to his workmates and complained, and his anger aggravated his lung disease, and he soon vomited blood and died. Another time, a sick worker from the Electric Steam Plant asked Weiss to sign a sick leave slip so that he could go to the hospital for treatment, but Weiss sternly asked, "Why don't you take off your hat when you enter my office?" and scolded him out. While Weiss was oppressing the workers, he also showed a lack of a sense of responsibility for production. When the plant's No. 3 generator was being dismantled and repaired, Weiss suddenly issued an urgent order on the morning of July 2nd: to install it immediately and start the engine. The workers put aside other work and rushed to complete it. After spending a lot of coal and steam to start the engine, they reported to Weiss and asked him to come and inspect it. Unexpectedly, he ordered the engine to be shut down, saying that it would be started again in the afternoon. The workers raised objections to Weiss's childish attitude of working without a plan and wasting raw materials and labor, but he turned a deaf ear. For example, the boiler tubes in the plant had been in use for a long time, and technicians and workers suggested that they be repaired in rotation according to a plan, but Weiss refused. Workers have always respected engineers; only when specialists and workers cooperate closely can they exert greater scientific and technological effectiveness. But Weiss is different from other engineers. Weiss does not respect or promote the attitude of workers who are concerned, actively provide improvement suggestions based on experience, and are responsible for production, and he adopts an arrogant attitude that he thinks he is right; and his methods often do not work, thus further deepening the dissatisfaction of the workers. Recently, due to the issue of increasing temporary workers, Weiss more fully exposed his arrogant attitude. The facts are as follows: The workers who watch the water pump in the power plant used to clean the凤髦子吸尘器vacuum cleaner every few days, but later changed it to cleaning it every day. The workers there were too busy, so they asked Weiss to send two temporary workers to help for two or three hours every day. Weiss initially delayed answering, and then said that he would have to go to the Tangshan Main Mine to ask for instructions. At this time, he deliberately made things difficult for the workers, transferring Zhu Jingwen, a worker from the 10 o'clock shift, to the 2 o'clock shift, but did not reply to the workers' request. The military representative of the Linxi Mine, in order to help solve the above problems, notified Weiss twice to talk. He refused to come. The third time, the Linxi mine director also used the phone to invite Weiss to discuss and resolve this issue together, but he was also refused. This is an illegal resistance to the military representative in the performance of his duties, and it is also disrespectful to the mine director. After repeated patient urging from all parties, he finally attended a joint meeting of union representatives, military representatives, the mine director, and electromechanical engineering personnel that afternoon. On the spot, the workers raised many opinions about Weiss's past mistakes, and also raised reasonable improvement suggestions for production. Weiss showed no repentance and was arrogant. In the end, he had no reason to defend himself, so he left the meeting in the middle and left in anger, causing the problem to remain unresolved and making the workers unbearably angry. All the workers believe that Weiss's behavior is a contempt and insult to our Kailuan workers with an imperialist attitude. In addition to reporting this matter and requests to the Tangshan Military Control Commission, the General Labor Union, and the Kailuan Labor Union Preparatory Committee, they also demanded that the mine ask Weiss to make a public apology, admit his mistakes, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future.

    帝国主义蛮横态度不改
    英人外斯欺压职工
    开滦林西矿工愤慨抗议
    要求公开道歉承认错误
    【唐山三十一日电】开滦栾矿务局林西总发电厂长英人外斯（译音），以帝国主义者的态度刁难欺压职工，并非法抗拒该矿军事代表执行工作，激起全矿职工的愤慨抗议。外斯在到林西总发电厂工作以来，一贯用蛮横态度对待职工，唐山解放后，他还擅自发出处罚脱班工人布告（本年一月二十八日的事），除严格规定工人脱班五日要扣罚一天工资之外，更规定要从去年十一月份起算。对于矿方欠发工资，工人们忍饥挨饿地保护电厂，并努力工作保证生产的进行，却只字未提，已经引起工人莫大不满。外斯非但不以此为意，继又把班上应作的活计，令工人在下班后再做，如三号发电机每天要拆下舆瓦盖来检查毛病，以前是上午拆下午再装上去，外斯却强迫工人在下班之后再装，使工人们每天要延长工时四十五分钟才能回家，工人提了三次意见，请求改在班内做，外斯非但不接受，反蛮不讲理地强迫工人非干不可，并威胁说：“如果不干，就向上级报告你们不负责任”。有一次为了差十分钟工人收拾家具洗手下班的事，外斯把一个公认成绩优良的服务开滦三十多年的老工头申焕然叫去痛骂一顿，申工头恐怕挨刷，不敢反驳，回来向工友们哭诉，气愤加重了他的肺病，不久即吐血而死。又一次电汽厂有个病工请外斯签病假单，以便到医院诊治，外斯却厉声责问：“进我的公事房为什么不脱帽。”把他骂出去了。在外斯欺压工人的同时，并表现了他对生产责任心的不足，应该厂三号发电机正在拆卸修理时，七月二日上午外斯突下急令：要马上装好开车，工人们都放下别的工作把它突击完成，化费了大量的煤和汽把电机开动了，报告外斯请来检验，不料他又下令关车，说是等下午再开。对于外斯这种工作无计划和浪费原料人工的儿戏态度，工人向他提出意见，他却置若罔闻。再如该厂锅管圈使用日久，技师和工人建议要有计划地轮回修理，亦遭外斯拒绝。工人对工程师向来是尊重的，只有专门家与工人密切合作，才能发挥更大的科学技术效能。但外斯和别的工程师两样，对于工人关心，根据经验，积极提供改进的意见对生产负责的态度，外斯是不尊重的，不发扬的，且采取自以为是的傲慢态度；而他的办法又时常行不通，因此再度加深了工人们的不满。最近复因增加临时工问题，外斯更充分地暴露了他的傲慢态度，事实经过是这样：发电厂看水泵的工人，在以往每隔几天将凤髦子吸尘器打扫一次，后改为每天打扫，该处工友忙不过来，乃向外斯请求每天加派两个临时工来帮二、三小时的忙，外斯起初拖延不答，继则推说要到唐山总矿去请示，这时，他故意与工人为难，把十点班工人朱景文调到两点班，对工人之要求则迄不答复。林西矿军事代表为了帮助解决上述问题，两次通知与外斯谈话。他竟拒绝不来，第三次林西矿长又用电话约外斯共同商讨解决此问题，亦遭拒绝，这是非法抗拒军事代表执行工作，并且对矿长也是不尊重的。后经各方耐心督促，始于当日下午参加了工会代表、军事代表、矿长及机电工程人员的联席会议。当场工人对外斯过去种种错误行为提出许多意见，并提出对生产合理的改进意见，外斯则毫无改悔，态度蛮横，最后无理可辩，竟中途退席，拂袖而去，致问题未得解决，使工人们忍无可忍，愤懑异常，全体职工认为外斯的这种行为，是以帝国主义者的态度对我开滦职工的蔑视与侮辱，除将此事经过及要求呈报唐山市军管会、总工会、开滦工会筹委会外，并向矿方提出要求外斯公开道歉，承认错误，保证以后不再发生类似事件。
