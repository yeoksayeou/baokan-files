Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 29th: A dispatch from Hong Kong states: The Hong Kong British government is doing its utmost to turn Hong Kong into a fascist world of terror, using every means to deprive Chinese residents of their freedom. Following the reactionary "Societies Registration Ordinance," the Hong Kong Legislative Council proposed and passed the "Household Registration Ordinance," the "Emergency Defense Powers Bill," and the so-called "Expulsion of Undesirable Elements Ordinance" on the 4th and 17th of this month, respectively.

The "Household Registration Ordinance" stipulates that all residents of Hong Kong over the age of twelve, as well as immigrants, with the exception of British army, naval, and air force personnel, Hong Kong police, travelers with formal passports or transit permits, or those explicitly exempted by the Hong Kong British government, must apply for a resident identity card. When applying for the identity card, they must submit photographs, fingerprints, and registration numbers. Any changes in residence, employment, death, or family population must be reported promptly, and failure to do so will result in a fine of up to two thousand yuan or imprisonment for up to one year. The ordinance also stipulates that the registration officer has the power to summon anyone for questioning, and the registrar has the power to arrest and search so-called people and property "required by law," and has the right to revoke anyone's identity card.

The "Emergency Defense Powers Bill" stipulates that those who "violate public order" can be punished with the death penalty, and it simplifies trial procedures and waives jury participation in certain cases.

The "Expulsion of Undesirable Elements Ordinance" stipulates that "any qualified authority" designated by the Hong Kong government has the right to interrogate "any undesirable element" and expel them from Hong Kong. It also stipulates that police officers of the rank of Deputy Superintendent or above have the power to arrest "suspected undesirable elements" and detain them in "designated shelters." The ordinance lists fourteen types of "undesirable elements," including those suspected of promoting rebellion or disrupting public order, and residents occupying unauthorized housing. The last two categories stipulate the expulsion of those whom the Hong Kong authorities do not want to reside in Hong Kong, and their families. That is, as long as the Hong Kong British government does not want them to reside in Hong Kong, they should be expelled.

At the same time, the Hong Kong British government announced a "New Emergency Requisition Ordinance" on the 16th, stipulating that the Hong Kong government can arbitrarily requisition civilian land, houses, livestock, vehicles, ships, airplanes, etc. The Hong Kong government can sell or occupy these civilian properties; the Hong Kong government can force residents to hand over needed items, and if they do not, they will be forcibly seized. The Hong Kong government also announced that the bill does not need to be passed by the Hong Kong Legislative Council and can be implemented immediately.

In addition, the Hong Kong government closed seven "Hong Kong and Kowloon Workers' Children Schools" run by Chinese laborers on August 9th, and forcibly disbanded the board of directors of the Aberdeen Fisheries School, run by Chinese fishermen, on the 16th.

This series of savage and ferocious reactionary measures by the Hong Kong British authorities has aroused the common opposition of people from all walks of life residing in Hong Kong, and they have protested against these fascist-style "ordinances" of the Hong Kong government.

　　香港英帝穷凶极恶！
  　制定一连串反动法令剥夺中国居民自由
    留港侨胞一致抗议
    【新华社北平二十九日电】香港讯：香港英政府正在极力把香港变成法西斯恐怖世界，用一切办法剥夺中国居民的自由。继反动的“社团登记条例”之后，香港立法局又于本月四日和十七日分别提出和通过了“户口登记条例”、“紧急防御权力法案”和所谓“驱逐不良分子法令”。“户口登记条例”规定，香港所有十二岁以上的居民及进口移民，除英国海陆空军、香港警察及具备正式护照或获得过境证的旅客、或香港英政府明令豁免登记的人以外，都要申请取得居民身份证，在申请身份证时须缴像片、打指印和编号；登记后如迁移、离职、死亡及家庭人口变动时都须及时呈报，逾期将处以两千元以下的罚金或一年以下的徒刑。条例并规定登记官有权力召集任何人来询问，登记处长有权力逮捕、搜查所谓“在法律上有必须”的人和财物，并有权取消任何人的身份证。“紧急防御权力法案”规定可对“违反治安者”处以极刑，并规定简化审判程序及在若干案件上免除陪审团的参预。“驱逐不良分子法令”规定香港政府指定的“任何有资格当局”有权审讯“任何不良分子”和把他们驱逐出香港，并规定副警监一级以上的警官有权逮捕“嫌疑的不良分子”和将他们拘留在“指定的收容所”内。该法令中列举了十四种“不良分子”，其中包括所谓有促进叛乱或捣乱公共秩序嫌疑的人们和占居未经准许的房屋中的居民等等，其最后两种则是规定驱逐香港当局不愿其留居香港的人及其家属，就是说只要香港英政府不愿其居留香港，他就该被驱逐。
    与此同时，香港英政府并于十六日宣布了一个“新紧急征用条例”，规定香港政府可任意征用民间土地、房屋、牲畜、车辆、船舶、飞机等，香港政府对这些民间财物并可加以变卖或占有；香港政府可以强迫居民缴出需要的物品，如不缴出，即强制占用。香港政府并宣布该法案不需再经香港立法局通过，即可执行。此外，香港政府并于八月九日封闭了中国劳工主办的七处“港九劳工子弟学校”，于十六日强迫解散了中国渔民所办的香港仔渔校的校董会。
    香港英国当局这一连串穷凶极恶的反动措施，已引起居留香港的中国各阶层人士的共同反对，他们已对港政府这些法西斯式的“条例”提出抗议。
