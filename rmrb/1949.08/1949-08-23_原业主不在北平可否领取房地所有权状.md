To the Editor:

    I have a difficult problem and would appreciate your guidance. My younger brother is currently studying in the United States and has ancestral property that I have managed on his behalf for many years. Last year, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, I completed the necessary blueprint procedures at the puppet land administration bureau. At the time, I was unable to collect it due to illness. I recovered in November, just as the Liberation War was commencing, and still did not collect it. Now, our People's Government has explicitly announced that "those who have not previously collected land ownership certificates and blueprints can collect them," and also stated that designated representatives can handle all procedures with their residence permits. Therefore, I took all the necessary documents to the land administration bureau to collect the blueprint, but the comrade there said that I could not collect it; that he himself had to collect it, or present his own residence permit, household registration, and other documents. I find this reply difficult to understand, and I request the editor to provide a reply!

Mr. Zheng Zheng:

    Regarding your inquiry about collecting the land and property ownership certificate, we have received the following separate reply from the Beiping Municipal People's Government Land Administration Bureau:

    "(1) Item 3 of the 'Notice on Land and Property Registration in the Urban Area of this City' stipulates: '...if the original rights holder is indeed unable to jointly apply due to circumstances, the current rights holder is allowed to handle it alone by obtaining a guarantee letter from a reputable shop.' This refers specifically to the special circumstances of new and old property owners of transfer contracts established before the start of the registration business of this bureau, within the one-month period for handling registration procedures from the date of the bureau's commencement of registration. It is unrelated to the regulations for collecting land and property ownership certificates. The aforementioned regulation is now a thing of the past.

    (2) If the original property owner is not in Beiping, a certificate from their work unit or the relevant regional-level or higher authority should be provided, along with a power of attorney from the property owner. A family member may then bring the false Kuomintang identity card, household registration form, and seal to the bureau to collect the land and property ownership certificate on their behalf (but this method is limited to owners currently within the liberated areas; those in areas outside the liberated areas will not be issued the certificate until the owner's identity is verified)."

　　原业主不在北平可否领取房地所有权状编者同志：
    今有一难题请分神指示，本人之弟现在美国读书，有祖业房产一所，托本人代管多年，于去年国民党反动派统治时期已在伪地政局将应领之蓝图手续办妥，当时因本人患病，故未领到，十一月病愈，适值解放战争，仍未领。今我人民政府明令公布“前未领取土地权状蓝图者可以领取”，且说明亦可托代管人持居住证件代办一切手续。故这次本人持所有的证件赴地政局与一同志洽领蓝图，但该同志说，不能领，要他本人来领，或持他本人之居住证，户口等件方可。这样的答复，本人实难理解，请编者予以答复！　　　　郑政郑政先生：
    你所询问有关领取房地所有权状问题，今承北平市人民政府地政局分别答复于后：
    “（一）本市城区房地登记须知第三条后项规定：‘…其原权利人确因故不能会同声请时，准予现权利人取具殷实店铺保证书单独办理之’系专指于本局登记业务开始前，成立的移转契约之新旧房地业主，自本局开办登记之日起，在一个月办理登记手续期限内之特殊情形而言，与领取房地所有权状之规定无关，现在前项规定已成过去。
    （二）如原业主未在平，应由其服务机关或所在地区级以上机关出具证明文件，并附具本人之委托书，得由其家属携带伪国民身份证及户口单图章，来局代领房地所有权状（但此项办法仅限于业主现在解放区内，其在解放区以外地方者，在未了解业主身份前一律不发）。  ——编者
