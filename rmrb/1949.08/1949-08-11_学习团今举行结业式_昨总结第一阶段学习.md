    First Phase of Learning Summarized Yesterday
    [Our Newspaper] The summer study group of university and middle school students will conclude today (the 11th) as scheduled. The closing ceremony will be held at 11:00 AM today at the Peking University Democratic Plaza. The study group has lasted for exactly four weeks from its opening to today. Two thousand students from major universities and middle schools have engaged in intensive and enthusiastic learning during these four weeks of collective life, studying reports on "The Materialist Conception of History," "Labor Creates the World," "Class Struggle," "Revolutionary Outlook on Life," "Party History," "Internationalism and Patriotism," "Student Movement," "Youth League Work," and "Women's Issues." They have made significant progress in their ideology and work style.

    [Our Newspaper] On the day before the end of the summer study group for university and middle school students in this city (i.e., the 10th), a typical report meeting summarizing the first phase was held on the Peking University Democratic Plaza. All four subgroups of the study group, totaling two thousand university and middle school students, participated.
    At the meeting, Peng Peiyun of the study group's research office first gave a summary report on the past half-month. She pointed out that students have made significant progress since joining the group, gradually moving from having no class viewpoint, or unclear class viewpoints, and lacking a labor viewpoint, to initially establishing a labor viewpoint, understanding the laws of social development, seriously criticizing past supra-class viewpoints, and establishing a revolutionary outlook on life. She also mentioned that students have transitioned from being unrealistic when they first joined the group to being able to integrate theory with practice, exposing old ideas, learning to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and establishing correct learning viewpoints and methods. She continued by saying that intellectuals have only one bright future, which is to combine with workers and peasants to serve them, and most students have recognized this principle. Therefore, there have been significant changes among the students. Those with landlord thinking have dug out the roots of their thinking. Members of the Sanminzhuyi Youth League have confessed and repented for past mistakes. As a result, more than 60% of non-league member students have applied to join the New Democratic Youth League. She pointed out that the reasons for such achievements are: (1) The leadership of the Communist Party and the assistance of the People's Government. (2) The increased awareness and active learning of all members and students who came to the study group, and mutual assistance. (3) The efforts of all cadre comrades. Finally, she pointed out the direction for the students' future efforts: to continue long-term and unremitting study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and to improve themselves through action. After her report, six students then gave typical reports.
    Finally, Zhang Dazhong, the person in charge of the study group, gave a concluding speech. Students left the venue in a happy and excited mood. Some students said, "Today's meeting was meaningful. The students' reports gave us great inspiration."

    【本报讯】本市大中学生暑期学习团结束的前一天（即十日），在北大民主广场上举行了第一阶段的总结典型报告会。学习团的四个分团，共两千名大中学生均参加。
    会上，首先由学习团研究室彭佩云作半个月来的总结报告，她指出同学们入团后有着显著的进步，从没有阶级观点，或阶级观点不明确，以及没有劳动观点等逐渐走向初步的建立了劳动观点，并知道了社会发展的规律，严肃的批判了过去超阶级的观点，建立起革命的人生观。同时她说到同学们从入团时的好高鹜远已转变到能以理论联系实际，暴露旧思想；学习使用批评与自我批评的武器，建立了正确的学习观点与方法。她接着说：知识分子只有一个光明的前途，就是与工农结合为工农服务，大部分同学都能认识到这个道理。因此，同学中有着显著的变化。有地主思想的能掘出了思想根源。三青团员坦白了，悔悟了过去犯的错误，因此在非团员同学中有百分之六十以上的人提出申请入新民主主义青年团。她指出所以有这样成绩的原因：（一）共产党的领导和人民政府的协助。（二）由于全体来学习团的团员们和同学们的觉悟提高和积极学习，互相帮助。（三）全体干部同志的努力。最后，她指出了同学们今后努力的方向：就是继续长期不懈的学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，在行动中提高自己。她报告完结后，紧接着是六位同学的典型报告。
    最后，学习团负责人张大中作结束语。同学们在快乐兴奋的情绪下列队离开会场，有的同学说：“今天这会有意思，同学的报告，给了我们很大的启发。”
