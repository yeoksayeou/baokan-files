    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 12th: Unemployment in various enterprises in the United States is becoming increasingly serious. According to a TASS dispatch from New York on the 10th, the US Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census's statistics on the number of fully unemployed people in the United States in July did not report the number of partially employed (i.e., those employed for no more than 35 hours per week). However, it is pointed out that the number of partially employed people is higher than in June. Reactionary newspapers deliberately keep silent about the unemployment situation, but progressive trade union newspapers depict a fairly comprehensive picture of the spread of unemployment. In Massachusetts, the center of light industry, 200,000 people are unemployed, double the number of a year ago. In Michigan, 210,000 industrial workers are unemployed, and 25,000 agricultural laborers have no work to do. In the northern part of the state, unemployed workers account for nearly 20 percent of all workers. The number of unemployed in Illinois has increased to 167,000, compared to 101,000 last November. San Francisco has 55,000 unemployed, compared to 37,000 last year. From January to June of this year, 10 percent of all rubber industry workers were unemployed, and thousands of workers only had part-time work. The number of construction workers has decreased by 92,000 compared to last June. In the textile industry, approximately 250,000 people are unemployed. In the Portland area of Oregon, about half of the sawmill workers are unemployed. The pain brought about by the growing economic crisis is not limited to millions of unemployed workers, but also affects all workers in the United States. According to the Associated Press, workers lose $12 billion in wages annually due to production cuts, while real wages have fallen by 15 percent since the end of the war.

    美经济危机严重
    失业蔓延全国
    【新华社北平十二日电】美国各种企业中的失业日益严重。据塔斯社纽约十日讯，美商务部人口统计局关于美国七月份完全失业人数的统计，未报道部分就业（即每周受雇时间不超过三十五小时）者的人数。但是，人们指出：部分就业人数较六月为多。反动的报纸故意闭口不谈失业情况，但进步的职工会报纸则描绘了一幅相当全面的失业蔓延的图画。在轻工业的中心马萨诸塞州，有二十万人失业，为一年前的一倍。密执安州有二十一万产业工人失业，二万五千农业劳动者无工可作。在该州北部，失业工人几达全部工人的百分之二十。伊利诺斯州失业人数已增至十六万七千人，去年十一月为十万零一千人。旧金山有五万五千人失业，而去年为三万七千人。今年一月至六月，全部橡胶工业工人中有百分之十失业，而数以千计的工人只有部分时间工作。建筑业工人较去年六月减少九万二千人。在纺织工业中，约有二十五万人失业。俄勒冈州波特兰地区约有一半的锯木厂工人失业。日益增长的经济危机所带来的痛苦，不仅限于数以百万计的失业工人，而且影响及美国全体工人。据报联社称，工人由于生产的削减，每年失去一百二十亿美元的工资，同时实际工资自战争结束以来，已降低了百分之十五。
