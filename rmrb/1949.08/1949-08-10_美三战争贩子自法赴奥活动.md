Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th. Reports from various sources: American Army, Navy, and Air Force Chief of Staff Bradley and others flew from Paris to Vienna on the 7th. They have concluded their talks with the military authorities of the nine countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. These nine countries are Italy, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Portugal. After the Paris negotiations concluded, Dunfield, representing the American Chiefs of Staff, gave a speech to the press in Paris on the 6th. He began by saying: "We have had the most successful negotiations, and we are in extreme agreement on almost every issue." However, Dunfield immediately contradicted himself by saying that "no decision was made" on the main issue of the proposed military organization stipulated in the North Atlantic Treaty. Dunfield had affirmed in London at the beginning of last week that the organization of the North Atlantic Treaty would be completed before the end of this year, but now he expressed doubt, saying: "This date was conjured up out of thin air." Several reporters asked Dunfield: How many weapons will the United States supply to Western Europe? When will the supply begin? Who will get what? These are some of the issues that the reactionary authorities in Western Europe are most concerned about. Dunfield replied, "These issues were not discussed, or at least no decisions were made." Dunfield did not mention the issue of military command. Regarding this issue, sources indicate that it was a major point of contention in the negotiations. The American warmongers demanded a high degree of centralized command, but many countries opposed it. It has already been revealed by American and British news agencies that the representatives of Norway and Denmark. are among those. It is said that Norway and Denmark "doubt whether it is wise to weaken Scandinavia by providing aid to countries such as Italy and Portugal."

    美三战争贩子自法赴奥活动
    【新华社北平九日电】各方报道：美海陆空军参谋长布莱德雷等已于七日自巴黎飞维也纳，他们已结束了与九个参加北大西洋公约国家军事当局的会谈，这九个国家是意、卢、英、丹、挪、法、比、荷、葡。在巴黎谈判结束之后，邓菲尔德六日曾代表美国参谋长们在巴黎向记者会发表谈话。他开头就说：“我们有着最成功的谈判，差不多在一切问题上意见都极为一致。”可是，邓菲尔德马上自打嘴巴说：在北大西洋公约所规定的拟议中的军事组织这一主要问题上，“并未作出决定”。关于北大西洋公约的组织是否会在今年年底以前完成问题，邓菲尔德在上周初曾于伦敦加以肯定，但现在却表示怀疑了，邓菲尔德说：“这一日期是凭空想出来的”。若干记者询问邓菲尔德：美国将供给西欧多少武器？在何时开始供给？谁将得到什么？这是西欧各反动当局最关心的一些问题。邓菲尔德回答说：“这些问题并未讨论，至少是未作决定”。邓菲尔德未谈到军事指挥问题。关于这一问题，消息指出，曾经是谈判中的一个重要争论问题。美国战贩们曾要求指挥的高度集中，但不少国家表示反对，已经为美英通讯社透露的就有挪威和丹麦的代表。据说，挪、丹“怀疑以援助如意大利和葡萄牙等国而使斯堪的纳维亚遭到削弱是否聪明”。
