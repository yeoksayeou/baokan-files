The Economic Relations Between the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
(Continued)
M. Baromov

The People's Democratic countries obtain Soviet technical assistance based on various agreements. With this assistance, they have been able to restore their industries in a short period of time, and even greatly expand them, building new factories equipped with the latest machinery. This has greatly accelerated their economic recovery and development.

Learning from the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries also provide technical assistance to each other, which also promotes economic and cultural development. Poland and Czechoslovakia signed a long-term economic cooperation agreement in 1947. In 1948, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland signed similar agreements, as did Romania and Czechoslovakia.

In addition, the People's Democratic countries coordinate their production plans with each other. Based on the raw material conditions of each country, a common plan is drawn up to produce certain products—countries cooperate to standardize products, implement division of labor, and achieve large-scale production. Some experience has been gained in the joint construction of factories, power plants, and transportation facilities.

It is worth noting that this economic cooperation is progressing simultaneously with the direct contact between workers of the People's Democratic countries. The direct contact between workers also supports and strengthens this economic cooperation. For example, workers in several Czech factories and Polish factories are engaged in production competitions. Workers in a Polish textile factory and workers in several factories in Kroměříž, Czech Republic, are engaged in production competitions. The goal of their competition is to complete output ahead of schedule and increase productivity.

According to the Potsdam Conference decision, German property in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania was transferred to the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union did not remove the aforementioned industrial plants. In order to take care of the national interests of these countries, the Soviet Union allowed these factories to start operations in place, and even replaced old and outdated machines with new ones. These factories and the joint ventures established to operate them provide another example of economic cooperation based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit.

These factories and joint ventures owned by the Soviet Union are operated entirely in accordance with the interests of the countries where they are located. What is produced is entirely determined by the economic plans of the country where they are located. The products produced are then handed over to the commercial and economic authorities of that country for disposal. It goes without saying that this has made a significant contribution to the economic recovery and improvement of the People's Democratic countries.

In those joint ventures, the Soviet Union and its counterpart have equal rights. Not only are profits distributed equally, but management is also conducted on the principle of economic parity. The company is managed by a board of directors, with an equal number of directors from both sides, and the directors on both sides have equal powers and responsibilities. The principle of equality in the management of joint ventures avoids the possibility of one party monopolizing the operation and ensures that everything is carried out on a completely fair and coordinated basis.

The social systems of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries preclude economic inequality or the possibility of one party exerting political pressure on another. Cooperation with the Soviet Union enables the working people of the People's Democratic countries to strengthen the socialist components of their economies and receive reliable support in laying the foundations of socialism. They benefit from the Soviet Union's advanced technology and production experience, as well as economic management methods, and absorb them to benefit their countries.

Here is one example among many. A well in the Ploiești oil field in Romania adopted the Soviet method of moving cranes without dismantling them. In the past, it took ten people thirty-five days to move a crane. However, using the Soviet method, the same number of people completed the task in just four days. This saved 2,325,000 lei (Romanian currency) and advanced the well digging work by thirty-one days. "Spark Newspaper" reported in May that some workers at the "Republic" factory decided to learn the Soviet method of one person managing more than one machine; as a result, workers' incomes increased significantly, and production also increased.

Facts have proven on what a sound basis the countries of the democratic camp have established their economic cooperation and mutual assistance. One of the factors helping to strengthen this foundation is the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance established by the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries in January of this year. In the six months since the committee was established, the economic ties between the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe have made new progress.

　　苏联与人民民主国家的经济关系
  　（续完）
    Ｍ·巴罗莫夫
    各人民民主国家是根据各种协定取得苏联技术援助。有了这个援助，它们就得以在短时间内恢复它们的工业，甚至大大扩展它们的工业，建造新的、装置有最新式机器的工厂。大大地加快了它们的经济恢复和发展。
    各人民民主国家学习苏联的榜样，相互间实行技术上的互助，这也促进了经济和文化的发展。波兰和捷克于一九四七年签订了一个长期经济合作协定。一九四八年，匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚与波兰签订了类似的协定，罗马尼亚和捷克也签订了类似的协定。
    此外，还有这样一些情形：各人民民主国家把它们的生产计划互相配合起来。根据各国的原料情况，拟定了一个共同的计划，生产某种产品——各国合作把产品标准化，实行分工，大规模生产。在共同建筑工厂、电力厂和运输设备方面，已经取得了一些经验。
    值得注意的，是这种经济合作，和各人民民主国家工人间的直接联系同时并进。而工人的直接联系也支持和巩固这种经济合作。例如，几个捷克工厂和波兰工厂的工人进行生产竞赛。一个波兰纺织厂的工人和捷克克罗摩夫地方几个工厂的工人进行生产竞赛。他们竞赛的目标都是为着提早完成产量和提高生产率。

    根据波茨坦会议的决定，德国在保加利亚、匈牙利和罗马尼亚的财产都归苏联所有。但是苏联并没有把上述工业工厂移走。苏联为了照顾这些国家的民族利益，使这些工厂在原地开工，甚至拿新的机器代替破旧、逾龄的机器。这些工厂和为经营这些工厂而设的合营公司，又提供了以平等互利为原则的经济合作的例子。
    这些所有权属于苏联的工厂和合营的公司，是完全遵循它们所在地国家的利益经营的。生产什么，完全决定于所在地国家的经济计划。生产出来的产品则交给该国的商业和经济当局处理。这对各人民民主国家的经济恢复和提高，有不小的贡献，自不待言。
    在那些合营的公司中，苏联和它的对方权利平等。不仅利润平均分配，而且在管理上也是以经济上对等的原则行事。公司由董事会管理，双方都有同等数目的董事，双方的董事有同等权力和责任。合营公司管理上的对等原则，避免了某一方包办代替的可能性，而且保证了一切事情都在完全公平和协调的基础上进行。
      ×  ×　　　　×  ×
    苏联和人民民主国家的社会制度排除了经济上的不平等，或由一方对另一方施行政治压力的可能性。与苏联合作使各人民民主国家的劳动人民能够加强他们经济中的社会主义成分，并在奠定社会主义的基础中得到可靠的支持。他们从苏联的前进技术与生产经验以及经济管理方法方面，得到了益处，加以吸收，以利于他们的国家。
    下面是许许多多的例子中的一个。罗马尼亚普罗业什特油田的一个油井，采用苏联方法搬动起重机，即搬动时不拆卸起重机。过去搬动一架起重机要十个人三十五天的工夫。但是采用了苏联的办法，同样数目的人只要四天就完成了。这就节省了二百三十二万五千雷伊（罗币），而且挖井工作提早了三十一天。“火花报”在五月里报导：“共和国”工厂的一些工人决定学习苏联的办法，一个人管一个以上的机器；结果工人的收入大大增加，而生产也提高了。
    事实证明，民主阵营各国是在怎样健全的基础上建立起它们的经济合作和互助。帮助加强这个基础的因素之一，是苏联和各人民民主国家今年一月所设立的经济互助委员会。委员会成立以来的六个月中，中欧和东南欧各国的经济联系，已经有了新的进展。
