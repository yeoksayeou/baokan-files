In the past, history only knew the methods of capitalist industrialization; now, history is beginning to understand the new methods of socialist industrialization. These two methods are fundamentally different in terms of their content and their results.

What is the method of capitalist industrialization? The characteristic of the capitalist industrialization method is the primary development of light industry. Without exception, the industrial development of all capitalist countries began with light industry. This method is determined by the laws of capitalist society. When capitalists create industries, they are not guided by social interests, but by personal desires. Obtaining maximum profit at the minimum cost is their fundamental motivation. Capital is invested in economic sectors that can obtain higher profits. Light industry is the economic sector that requires less capital and yields substantial profits. Light industry requires less capital than heavy industry. For example, the capital required to build a textile factory is much less than the capital required to build a hardware enterprise. Capital turnover in the light industry sector is faster than in the heavy industry sector. It is also easier for light industry to obtain high profits than heavy industry. Mastering the production of textiles, footwear, and other personal consumer goods is easier than organizing the production of complex hardware equipment such as locomotives, turbines, automobiles, and machines.

Heavy industry requires huge amounts of capital. At the beginning of the development of the bourgeois mode of production, individual capital was obviously insufficient to establish heavy industrial enterprises that manufactured the means of production. Therefore, for decades or even centuries, bourgeois countries mainly developed light industries, which played a leading role in the national economy. Comrade Stalin taught us that capitalist heavy industry only begins to develop when huge amounts of capital have been accumulated in light industry that can be used to develop heavy industry.

The industrial development of Tsarist Russia began after the reform of the serf system in 1861. Russia followed the same path as other capitalist countries in terms of industrial development, with light industry being the main industrial sector. After about fifty years, Russia began to develop modern heavy industry, but it was controlled by foreigners, which inevitably hindered the development of the national economy.

Economically, Tsarist Russia lagged far behind the major capitalist countries. By 1913, the backwardness of Russian industry compared to the advanced capitalist countries had not only not decreased, but had actually increased. If in 1900 Tsarist Russia produced eight times less iron per capita than the United States, three times less than France, and six times less than Germany, then by 1913 Russian iron production per capita was eleven times less than the United States, four times less than France, and eight times less than Germany.

The ruling classes of Tsarist Russia were unable to eliminate the country's backwardness and transform it into a powerful industrial nation. These classes found no way to develop it other than to subordinate the country to foreign capital. The bourgeois thinker Professor Grinevsky wrote in his book "The Future of Russian Industry After the War," published in 1919: "Attracting foreign capital is the basic task of Russia's economic recovery and development."

The following materials prove what consequences this policy led to! In 1900, 63 percent of all equipment in Russian industry was foreign-made, foreign machines were twice as expensive as Russian machines, and foreign capital flooded Russia; because this capital could obtain the highest profits here and plunder Russia's natural wealth and important economic positions. From 1885 to 1913, foreign investment in Russian industrial capital reached 515 million rubles, while profits reached 721 million rubles. This is the road of foreign imperialism enslaving our country, the road of foreign imperialism plundering our country.

Only a social system that gets rid of the incurable diseases of capitalism can eliminate the ancient vestiges of national backwardness, put the country on the progressive path of historical development, and turn it into an economically strong country. The Soviet social system created under the wise leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party is this kind of system.

After the victory of the socialist revolution and the establishment of the Soviet social system, our country began a nationwide struggle to restore the national economy on a socialist basis.

The Bolshevik Party embarked on national industrialization, viewing it as the central task without which all other tasks of socialist construction could not be solved. The Bolshevik Party began to develop industry from heavy industry, which manufactures the means of production for all sectors of the national economy.

"Not any industrial development can represent industrialization," Comrade Stalin said: "The center of industrialization, the foundation of industrialization, is the development of heavy industry (fuel, hardware, etc.), and finally, the development of the production of the means of production, the development of the machine manufacturing industry itself."

In implementing the method of socialist industrialization, which is characterized by the primary development of heavy industry, the Party proceeded from the necessity of solving the three basic historical tasks put forward in our country by the process of socialist revolution.

First, it must guarantee the elimination of the exploiting classes and the construction of a socialist society; second, it must defend the socialist cause in the struggle against the hostile encirclement of capitalism; and third, it must guarantee the continuous improvement of the material and cultural level of the people. The Party could not stand on the path taken by bourgeois countries of first developing light industry. The path of capitalist industrialization, as Comrade Stalin pointed out, is "a long road that requires decades, during which the development of light industry is waited for without heavy industry." Trotskyites, Bukharinites, and other enemies of the Party and the Soviet people attempted to push our country onto this road. They opposed the Lenin-Stalin plan for the industrialization of the socialist state and the Bolshevik speed of socialist construction. They pursued a policy of capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union, a policy of turning our country into a raw material appendage of the imperialist powers. They tried their best to make us use our savings first in developing the light industry sector, to spend our monetary funds on acquiring consumer goods, instead of purchasing the means of production. This was a harmful and fatal road for the Soviet Union; if we had taken this road, our country could not have become an economically independent country, and we could not have defended the fruits of the socialist revolution under the hostile encirclement of capitalism. Our country would have been disarmed in the face of fully armed imperialist countries. Obviously, the Communist Party could not take this road, taking this road would be tantamount to destroying the Soviet system.

"The Party understands," Comrade Stalin said, "that war is approaching, and without heavy industry, there is no possibility of defending the country. It is imperative to start the development of heavy industry, and any further delay will lead to complete defeat. The Party also remembers what Lenin said: without heavy industry, the independence of the country cannot be defended, and without heavy industry, the Soviet system will be destroyed. Therefore, our Communist Party abandoned the 'ordinary' road of industrialization and started the cause of national industrialization from the development of heavy industry. There were many difficulties in this way, but they have been overcome."

The difficulty in solving this task lies in the fact that our country was economically backward in the past, its productive forces were sharply reduced during the First World War, and then during foreign armed intervention, and industrialization could only be achieved by relying on its own funds. Capitalist countries industrialized by relying on various resources. Bourgeois countries used state loans, the exploitation of colonies, and reparations from defeated countries to achieve this goal. The industrialization of England depended on colonies. It plundered the colonies for hundreds of years, exploiting millions of working people in these colonies. England used the capital created in this way to expand its industry and accelerate the speed of its industrialization. Germany accelerated the development of heavy industry after the Franco-Prussian War in the 1870s. The 5 billion francs that Germany received from the defeated country, France, played a decisive role in the industrialization of the Ruhr area, the industrial base of German militarism.

Such methods of industrialization were not feasible for our country. Socialist countries cannot use such despicable sources of capital accumulation, because the plundering of colonies and military occupation for the purpose of plunder are incompatible with the nature of the Soviet regime.

Tsarist Russia attempted to realize industrialization by handing over its natural resources to foreign management and obtaining enslaving loans. Our country could not accept this method of industrialization either, because it would make our country enslaved, it would make our country a semi-colony of imperialist beasts. "This method," Comrade Stalin said, "is still not feasible for us. We fought a three-year civil war and defeated all kinds of armed interventionists, not in order to automatically be enslaved by imperialism after defeating these interventionists. There remains only the fourth road of industrialization, that is, the road of saving for industry itself, the road of socialist capital accumulation, which Lenin pointed out more than once, is the only unique road of industrialization for our country."

For industrialization, we must tap our own wealth, we must do so at any cost; because the question of industrialization is a matter of life and death, we must quickly restore heavy industry and promote its development as soon as possible, otherwise our working class will not be able to complete its historical tasks.

"Without saving heavy industry," Lenin wrote, "without restoring heavy industry, we cannot build any industry. And without heavy industry, our independent country will be destroyed. ... Heavy industry needs state subsidies, and if we cannot find this subsidy, then we as a civilized country - let alone a socialist country - will perish."

When discussing the program of socialist industrialization, Comrade Stalin said: "We are fifty to a hundred years behind the advanced countries. We should run this distance in ten years, either we do this well, or we will be defeated."

Lenin and Stalin's instructions on the necessity of rapidly developing heavy industry and eliminating our economic backwardness in the shortest possible time have been expressed by the Party's policy of restoring our economy on a socialist basis.

In order to catch up with and surpass the advanced capitalist countries in technology and economy, we must first comprehensively develop heavy industry and its essence - the machine manufacturing industry - and find the necessary resources for it in the country. These resources have been found by us.

Concentrating land, factories, workshops, railways, domestic and foreign trade, banks, budgets, and credit strongholds in its own hands, using the idle funds of workers, peasants, and intellectuals through lending and savings banks, and implementing a national austerity system, the Soviet state has created sources of capital accumulation that no capitalist country has ever seen. The state uses these sources of capital accumulation in a planned way to ensure the rapid development of heavy industry. These funds were obviously not enough to fully meet the needs of the national economy at the beginning. However, as the industry, transportation, and rural economy were restored and further developed year by year, the capital accumulation fund also increased, thus accelerating the speed of Soviet industrial development.

The first Stalin Five-Year Plan was an important stage in the industrial development of our country. During the first Stalin Five-Year Plan, we rebuilt the hardware, transportation, automobile, and machine manufacturing industries, as well as the industry for producing modern agricultural machinery and the air force industry. The Soviet Union's electricity production has entered the forefront of the world.

In the past, we only had one coal and hardware base in the south (Donbass, Krivoy Rog). During the first Five-Year Plan, this base was significantly expanded, and a second coal and hardware base was established in the east. Two new textile bases were established in Central Asia and Siberia.

In pointing out the achievements of socialist construction in the first Five-Year Plan and emphasizing the growth of the heavy industry sector, Comrade Stalin said: "We have not only established such new and large industrial sectors, but the scale and scope of their establishment make the scale and scope of European industry pale in comparison."

The conclusion of the first Five-Year Plan proves that our country has changed from an agricultural country to an industrial country. The proportion of industry in the national economy increased from 48 percent at the beginning of the Five-Year Plan to 70 percent at the end of the Five-Year Plan. Industrial production increased three times compared to before the revolution and two times compared to 1928. If it is estimated that the first Five-Year Plan has been basically completed in four years, then it means that industry has increased by an average of 50 percent per year. No capitalist country has ever seen such a development speed in its golden age.

When the Soviet people were realizing the first Five-Year Plan, the capitalist countries suffered a deep economic panic. The production of these countries was sharply reduced: the United States reduced by 44 percent, and the United Kingdom reduced by 20 percent.

In the competition with the socialist economic system, the capitalist economic system lost. The Soviet system proved its undeniable superiority over the capitalist system. The Party's policy of developing heavy industry was originally the only correct policy. This policy greatly benefited imperialism. Regarding this point, Comrade Stalin said in 1931:

"Look at how the well-known and 'respectable' gentlemen of America's Feiche, Britain's Churchill, and France's Poincaré are barking and going crazy against our Party! Why are they barking and going crazy? Because our Party's policy is correct, because this policy is gaining continuous success."

The second Five-Year Plan period was a new step forward in socialist industrial construction. During the second Five-Year Plan, machine production and metal production increased nearly three times. Half of the machines owned by our country in 1937 were made during the second Five-Year Plan. Electricity consumption increased by 168.8 percent. During the second Five-Year Plan, the cadre problem in all industrial sectors was solved. By the beginning of 1937, the intelligentsia had become a large army of 9.6 million.

The third Stalin Five-Year Plan, which was being successfully implemented by the Soviet people, was interrupted by the war starting in 1937.

After the Stalin Five-Year Plans, our country has changed. It has become a powerful industrial power capable of manufacturing any means of production.

As a result of the victorious completion of the Stalin Five-Year Plans, the Soviet Union has jumped to the forefront of the world in the production of industrial products. If the proportion of Tsarist Russia in world industrial production in 1913 was 2.6 percent, then the proportion of the Soviet Union in 1937 was 13.7 percent. If Tsarist Russia's industrial production in 1913 was 22 percent of British industrial production, 17.2 percent of German industrial production, and 40.3 percent of French industrial production; then the Soviet Union's industrial production in 1937 exceeded French industrial production by more than three times, British industrial production by one and a half times, and German industrial production by 17 percent. This is the actual summary of the Stalin Five-Year Plans. They proved the vitality of the Soviet social system and state system, and the vitality of the Soviet planned economic system.

Our country was forced to gradually accelerate the speed of socialist industrialization. The hostile capitalist encirclement is a great threat to us. We not only cannot delay our development speed in the slightest, but must accelerate it with all our strength.

"Delaying the speed," Comrade Stalin said, "means falling behind. And those who fall behind will be beaten. But we don't want to be beaten. No, we absolutely don't want to. The history of old Russia has been constantly beaten because of its backwardness. The Mongolian emperors beat it, the Turkish nobles beat it, the Swedish feudal lords beat it, the Polish and Lithuanian gentry beat it, the British and French capitalists beat it, and the Japanese lords beat it. Everyone beat it, because it was backward. Because of its military backwardness, its cultural backwardness, its national backwardness, its industrial backwardness, and its agricultural backwardness, because it was profitable and harmless to beat it... Beating the backward and beating the weak is the law of the oppressors, the cannibalistic law of capitalism."

The Soviet system is the only social system capable of overcoming our country's ancient backwardness. The innovative role of socialist industrialization lies first of all in this.

The fundamental difference between socialist industrialization and capitalist industrialization lies not only in the ways and methods of its realization, but also in its results for society.

Capitalist industrialization is conditional on the growth and deepening of class contradictions between the working class and the bourgeoisie. Socialist industrialization is to exclude capitalist elements from the national economy and completely eliminate the phenomenon of exploitation of man by man.

Capitalist industrialization leads to the growth of poverty and unemployment among the working class. Socialist industrialization leads to the continuous increase in the number of the working class and intellectuals and the improvement of the material conditions of the urban and rural working people.

Capitalist industrialization deepens the gap between urban and rural areas, causing millions of farmers to go bankrupt and lose their land and property. Socialist industrialization fundamentally destroys the past contradictions between urban and rural areas, creates the material prerequisites for rebuilding the rural economy on a socialist basis, and creates the material basis for completely eliminating contradictions between urban and rural areas.

In pointing out the role of socialist industrialization in reforming the Soviet state on a socialist basis, Comrade Stalin said:

"What are the basic advantages of the method of socialist industrialization? It lies in the unity of the interests of industrialization and the basic masses of the working people; it lies in the improvement of the material conditions of these masses, not the impoverishment of millions of people; not the sharpening of internal contradictions, but the coordination and resolution of these contradictions; it lies in the continuous expansion of the domestic market and the increase of its capacity, thereby creating a solid domestic foundation for the development of industrialization."

Such are the characteristics of socialist industrialization.

    苏联社会主义工业化的方法
    及其在国家经济革新中的作用
    苏联Ｆ·Ｐ柯舍列夫教授作
    马沛文节译
    从前，历史仅仅知道资本主义工业化的方法；现在，历史开始了解新的社会主义工业化的方法了。这两种方法不论其内容及其结果都是根本不同的。
    资本主义工业化的方法是怎么回事呢？首先发展轻工业是资本主义工业化方法之特征。没有例外，所有资本主义国家工业的发展都是从轻工业开始的。这种方法是由资本主义社会的规律所决定的。资本家在创建工业之时不是受社会利益所指导，而是受个人私欲指导的。以最小成本获最大利润是他们的根本动机。资本是投向那些能够获得更高利润的经济部门。轻工业便是所需资本较低而所获利润甚丰的经济部门。轻工业比重工业所需资本较少。例如：建立一个纺织工厂所需资本，较之建立一个五金企业所需资本要少得多。轻工业部门中的资本比重工业部门中的资本周转迅速。轻工业获取高利，亦较重工业容易。掌握纺织品、制靴及其他个人消费品的生产，比起组织机车、涡轮、汽车、机器等复杂的五金装备的生产，亦更容易。
    重工业需要巨大资本。在资产阶级生产方式开始发展时之个人资本，要建立制造生产手段的重工业企业显然是不足的。所以资产阶级国家在好几十年甚至要百年之久的过程中，主要是发展在国民经济中起主导作用的轻工业。斯大林同志教导我们：只有当轻工业中积累了巨大的可以用来发展重工业的资本之时，资本主义的重工业才开始发展起来。
    沙俄工业发展，开始于一八六一年的农奴制度改革以后。俄国在工业发展方面走着与其他资本主义国家同一道路，轻工业部门乃主要工业部门。经过五十年左右，俄国才开始发展现代的重工业，同时，它被掌握在外人之手，因此不能不阻碍国家经济的发展。
    在经济上沙俄非常落后于资本主义主要国家。到一九一三年，俄国工业比资本主义先进国家的落后性不仅未减，反更增加了。如果一九○○年沙俄产铁每人平均起来比美国少八倍，比法国少三倍，比德国少六倍的话，那么到了一九一三年俄国产铁每人平均起来就比美国少十一倍，比法国少四倍，比德国少八倍了。
    沙俄的统治阶级无能消除国家这一落后性，将它变做强大的工业国。这些阶级除过把国家从属于外国资本而外，就没有发现使其另外发展的道路。资产阶级的思想家格林涅夫斯基教授在其一九一九年出版的“战后俄国工业的前途”一书中写道：“吸收外国资本，乃是俄国经济恢复和发展的基本任务。”
    下面的材料证明这种政策招致了何等后果！一九○○年俄国工业全部装备的百分之六十三系外国产品，外国机器比俄国机器贵达两倍，外国资本充斥俄国；因为这些资本在这里能够获得最高利润并把俄国的自然财富和重要经济阵地掠入己手。从一八八五年到一九一三年，外国投资俄国工业的股本达五亿一千五百万卢布之多，而获利则达七亿二千一百万卢布之巨。这是外国帝国主义奴役我国的道路，这是外国帝国主义掠夺我国的道路。
    只有摆脱资本主义不治之症的社会制度，才能清除国家古老的落后残余，把国家推上历史发展的进步之路，把它变成在经济上的强国。在列宁——斯大林党的英明领导之下创建的苏维埃社会制度便是这种制度。
    社会主义革命胜利以后，苏维埃社会制度确立以后，我国便开始了在社会主义基础上为恢复国家经济的全民斗争。
    布尔塞维克党着手国家工业化，把它看做如果不加解决便不能解决社会主义建设的一切其他任务的中心任务。布尔塞维克党开始从为国民经济所有部门制造生产手段的重工业来发展工业。
    “不是发展任何工业，都可代表工业化。”斯大林同志说：“工业化的中心，工业化的基础是发展重工业（燃料，五金等），最后，发展生产手段的生产，发展机器制造业本身。”
    在实现首先发展重工业为其最大特点的社会主义工业化方法的时候，党是从解决被社会主义革命进程在我国面前提出的三个基本历史任务的必要性出发的。
    第一必须保证肃清剥削阶级，建设社会主义社会；第二在与资本主义敌对包围的斗争中保卫社会主义事业；第三保证人民物质和文化水平的不断高涨。党不能站在资产阶级国家走过的首先发展轻工业的道路上。资本主义工业化的道路——斯大林同志指出——这便是“漫长的须要几十年之久的道路，在这几十年的过程中，在没有重工业的情况下等待着轻工业的发展。”托洛斯基分子、布哈林分子以及其他党和苏维埃人民的敌人便企图把我国推上这一道路。他们反对列宁——斯大林的社会主义国家工业化的计划，反对社会主义建设的布尔塞维克速度。他们进行的是资本主义在苏联复辟的方针，变我国为帝国主义列强原料附庸的方针。他们竭力使我们把自己的积蓄首先用在发展轻工业部门上面，使我们的货币基金消耗在获取消费品上面，而不是去购买生产手段。这对苏联是有害的致命的道路；要是走了这条道路，我国在经济上便不可能成为一个独立的国家，我国便不可能在资本主义敌对包围的条件下保卫社会主义革命的果实。我国便在全副武装着的帝国主义国家面前解除了武装。显然，共产党不能走此道路，走此道路就等于毁灭苏维埃制度。
    “党懂得，”斯大林同志说：“战争迫近了，没有重工业便没有保卫国家之可能，着手重工业的发展，已经刻不容缓，对此再要迟滞，就会一败涂地。党还记着列宁所说：没有重工业，国家之独立便不能保卫，没有重工业，苏维埃制度便会被毁灭的话。所以我国共产党抛弃了工业化的‘普通’道路，从开展重工业开始国家工业化的事业。这样困难甚多，但是已被克服。”
    解决这一任务之困难即在于：我国过去在经济上是落后的，其生产力于第一次世界大战，接着又在外国武装干涉期间锐减了，还有要实现工业化只能依靠其本身资财。资本主义国家工业化是赖各种资源起家的。资产阶级国家运用国家的借贷，殖民地的榨取以及战败国的赔款以达此目的。英国之工业化就是依赖殖民地的。它把殖民地掠夺了几百年，对这些殖民地千百万劳动人民进行榨取。英国就用如此手法创建起来的资本以扩大其工业，加速其工业化的速度。德国是在前一世纪七十年代之普法战争以后才加速重工业发展的，德国从战败国法国得到的五亿法郎，对德国军国主义工业基地鲁尔区的工业化起了决定的作用。
    这样一些工业化的办法对于我国都是行不通的。社会主义国家不能运用如此卑污的资本积累源泉，因为对殖民地的掠夺以及以掠夺为目的的军事占领，是与苏维埃政权的天性积不相容的。
    沙俄企图把其自然资源拱手让予外国经营和获得奴役性贷款的办法实现工业化。这种工业化的办法，我国同样不能接受，因为它会使得我国被奴役，它会使得我国变为帝国主义野兽的半殖民地。“这种办法”，斯大林同志说：“对于我们还是此路不通，我们进行了三年之久的内战，打垮各种各样的武装干涉者，并非为了在战胜这些干涉者以后，自动地去受帝国主义的奴役。剩下只有第四条工业化的道路，这就是为了工业自己储蓄的道路，社会主义资本积累的道路，列宁不止一次指出，这是我国工业化唯一无二的道路。”
    为了工业化，我们必须发掘自身的财富，我们无论如何必须如此去做；因为工业化的问题是一个生死问题，我们一定要不惜任何代价很快恢复重工业，并推动其向前发展，否则我国的工人阶级便不能完成其历史任务。
    “不拯救重工业”，列宁写道：“不恢复重工业，我们便不能建立任何工业。而没有重工业，我们独立的国家就要毁灭。……重工业需要国家的补助金，如果我们找不到这种补助金，那么我们作为一个文明国家——且不说是社会主义国家了——也要灭亡的。”
    在论述社会主义工业化的纲领时，斯大林同志说：“我们比先进国家落后了五十年到一百年，我们应当在十年之内跑完这段距离，或者是我们做好这点，或者是我们被人打垮。”
    列宁和斯大林这些关于迅速发展重工业之必要性，关于最短期间消除我们经济上落后性的指示，已被党对社会主义基础上恢复我国经济的方针表现出来了。
    为了在技术和经济方面赶上并超过先进的资本主义国家，我们必须首先全面的发展重工业及其精髓——机器制造工业——并在国内为其找到必要的资源。这些资源曾被我们找到了。
    把土地、工厂、工场、铁路、内外贸易、银行、预算、信用据点集中在自己手中，通过借贷和储蓄银行利用工农和知识分子的游资，全国厉行节约制度之后，苏维埃国家创造了任何资本主义国家都不曾见过的资本积累源泉，国家有计划的运用这些资本积累源泉，以保证重工业的迅速发展。这些资财在开头要充分满足国民经济之需要显然还不够。但随着工业、运输和农村经济逐年恢复和进一步发展的程度，资本积累基金也增加了，就这样加速着苏联工业发展的速度。
    第一个斯大林五年计划，是我国工业发展中的一个重要阶段。在第一个斯大林五年计划期间，我们重新创建了五金、运输、汽车和机器制造工业以及生产现代化的农业机器工业、空军工业。苏联的电力生产则进入世界的前列了。
    从前我们只在南方（顿巴斯、克里沃罗日）有一个煤业五金基地。当第一个五年计划期间这一基地曾被显著地扩大，此外并在东方建立了第二个煤业五金基地。在中亚细亚和西伯利亚建立了两个新的纺织基地。
    在指出第一个五年计划社会主义建设的成绩和强调重工业部门的增长时，斯大林同志说：“我们不仅仅建立了这样一些新生的庞大的工业部门，而且其被建立的规模与范围使欧洲工业的规模与范围为之失色。”
    第一个五年计划的总结证明，我国从一个农业国变成一个工业国了。国民经济中工业的比重，从五年计划之始的百分之四十八到五年计划之终，增加到百分之七十了。工业生产量较革命前提高了三倍，较一九二八年提高了两倍。如果估计到第一个五年计划四年已经基本上完成了的话，那么就是说平均每年工业就增加百分之五十。如此发展速度，任何一个资本主义国家在其发展的黄金时代都不曾见过。
    当苏维埃人民实现第一个五年计划期间，资本主义国家遭受了深刻的经济恐慌。这些国家的生产锐减：美国减少百分之四十四，英国减少百分之二十。
    在与社会主义经济体系的竞争中，资本主义经济体系落选了。苏维埃体系证明其对资本主义体系的无可争辩的优越。党采取发展重工业的政策，原来是唯一正确的政策。这一政策使帝国主义大不受用。关于这点斯大林同志于一九三一年说道：
    “你看，美国的费熙，英国的邱吉尔，法国的普恩加莱，这些众所周知的可‘敬爱’的绅士们，在如何为反对我党而狂吠和发疯吧！他们干么要狂吠要发疯呢？因为我党的政策是正确的，因为这一政策获得不断成功。”
    第二个五年计划时期，是社会主义工业建设向前跨了新的一步。在第二个五年计划期间，机器生产和金属生产增加几近三倍。一九三七年我国所拥有的半数机器即系第二个五年计划中所制。电力消费增长百分之一百六十八点八。第二个五年计划期间解决了所有工业部门的干部问题。知识分子到一九三七年初即成了一支九百六十万的大军。
    正被苏维埃人民胜利实现的，从一九三七年开始进行的第三个斯大林五年计划为战争所中断。
    经过了斯大林五年计划，我国已经改观了。它变成了一个能够制造任何生产手段的强大的工业强国了。
    由于斯大林五年计划胜利完成的结果，苏联在工业品的生产上跃居世界前列。如果说一九一三年沙俄在世界工业生产中的比重为百分之二点六的话，那么一九三七年苏联的比重就是百分之十三点七了。如果沙俄的工业生产于一九一三年是英国工业生产的百分之二十二，德国的百分之十七点二，法国的百分之四十点三；那么苏联在一九三七年的工业生产即超过法国的工业生产三倍有余，英国的一又二分之一倍，德国的百分之十七。这就是斯大林五年计划的实际总结。他们证明了苏维埃社会制度和国家制度的活力，苏维埃计划经济体系的活力。
    我国被迫按步就班的加速社会主义工业化的速度。敌对的资本主义包围，对我们是个巨大的威胁。我们不仅不能丝毫迟滞我们的发展速度，而且必须全力加速它。
    “延缓速度”，斯大林同志说：“即是落后。而落后者就得挨打。可是我们不愿挨打。不，我们绝对不愿。旧俄历史即因其落后而不断挨打。蒙古的皇帝打它，土耳其的贵族打它，瑞典的封建主打它，波兰、立陶宛的绅士打它，英、法的资本家打它，日本的爵士打它。大家都打它，就是为其落后。为其军事落后，为其文化落后，为其国家落后，为其工业落后，为其农业落后，因为打了有利而无害……。打落后者，打软弱者，这就是压迫者的法律，资本主义吃人的法律。”
    苏维埃制度是能够战胜我国古来落后的一种唯一的社会制度。社会主义工业化的革新的作用首先就在这里。
    社会主义工业化与资本主义化之根本区别不仅在于其实现的方式和方法，而且在于其对社会的结果。
    资本主义工业化以工人阶级和资产阶级之间阶级矛盾的增长和加深为条件。社会主义工业化则是从国家经济中排除资本主义因素和完全消灭人剥削人的现象。
    资本主义工业化引起工人阶级的贫困和失业的增长。社会主义工业化则导向工人阶级和知识分子数量的不断增加以及城市和农村劳动人民物质情况的改善。
    资本主义工业化加深城市和农村的鸿沟，致使千百万农民破产，使其失掉土地和财产。社会主义工业化则根本破坏了城市和农村已往的矛盾，为在社会主义基础上重建农村经济创造了物质前提，并为完全肃清城市和农村矛盾创造了物质基础。
    在指出以社会主义为基础革新苏维埃国家中社会主义工业化的作用时，斯大林同志说：
    “社会主义工业化方法的基本优点在什么地方呢？在于它使得工业化的利益与人民劳动阶层底基本群众利益的统一；在于它不是使得千百万群众贫困化，而是这些群众物质情况的改善；不是内部矛盾的尖锐化，而是这些矛盾的调和和解决；在于它不断扩大了国内市场并提高其容量，以此为工业化的开展创造了巩固的国内基础。”
    社会主义工业化的特点，便是如此。
