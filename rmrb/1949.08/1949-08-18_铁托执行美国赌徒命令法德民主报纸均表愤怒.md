Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 17th: According to TASS, progressive public opinion in France and Germany continues to comment on the Soviet government's note to the Yugoslav government, denouncing the Tito clique's traitorous crimes.

　　The Paris "Sunday Humanité" published an article by Georges Cogniot entitled "Tito is an Enemy of the Soviet Union and the Cause of Peace." Cogniot wrote: The Soviet government's note to the Belgrade government revealed the Tito clique's complete abandonment of claims to Slovenia and Galician territory in the negotiations for the Austrian peace treaty more than two years ago, which was a bolt from the blue for the Tito clique. The Tito clique—a bunch of lying and slanderous rogues—attacks the Soviet Union, opposes the entire democratic camp, and executes the orders of American gamblers. Tito is attempting to turn small and brave Albania into his colony, just as Mussolini attempted in 1939. Recently, the Tito gang has intensified its slanders against Albania, echoed by the Marshallized newspapers of Paris. It is completely clear that the traitor Tito has colluded with the butcher Tsaldaris. Reliable sources confirm that on July 15, royalist fascist troops passed through Yugoslav territory to infiltrate the rear of the Greek Democratic Army.
　　On the 14th, German democratic newspapers expressed anger at the Tito clique's treacherous policies. All newspapers in the Soviet-occupied sector of Berlin published the full text or detailed summaries of the Soviet note. Neues Deutschland was headlined "Tito's Double-Dealing and Treachery." National-Zeitung wrote: "The Tito government is an enemy of the Soviet Union." Berliner Zeitung published an editorial entitled "Tito and Churchill," pointing out that the Soviet reply thoroughly exposed the treachery of the Yugoslav rulers. Berliner Zeitung further emphasized that it is extremely important to expose the cooperation between the Yugoslav leaders and the imperialist countries. The newspaper then pointed out that, as is well known, high-ranking British officials, including the son of the notorious anti-Soviet conspirator Churchill, had close ties with Tito even during the war. At that time, Britain supplied Tito with weapons. In January 1944, British troops landed in Greece, and they did not know whether they could hold out there. Therefore, in order to prevent Thessaloniki from falling into the hands of Greek anti-fascists, they supplied weapons to Tito's henchmen in Macedonia. Here arises the question: Did Tito even then undertake direct obligations to British imperialism? Did Churchill even then have reason to regard Tito as an ally in the imperialist anti-Soviet camp? Is it not there that the roots of Tito and his cohorts' betrayal of the international democratic movement and his current alliance with imperialism lie?"

　　铁托执行美国赌徒命令法德民主报纸均表愤怒
    【新华社北平十七日电】据塔斯社报道，法、德两国进步舆论续评苏联政府致南斯拉夫政府照会，痛斥铁托集团的叛逆罪行。
    巴黎“星期日人道报”载乔治·郭尼奥论文，题为“铁托是苏联与和平事业的敌人”。郭尼奥写道：苏联政府致贝尔格莱德政府的照会，揭露了铁托在商谈对奥和约中于两年多前即放弃对斯洛文加林西亚要求的全部罪恶，这对铁托集团是一个晴天霹雳。铁托集团——一帮说谎与诽谤的流氓——攻击苏联，反对整个民主阵营，执行美国赌徒的命令。铁托企图把小而勇敢的阿尔巴尼亚变成他的殖民地，正如墨索里尼在一九三九年所企图的一样。最近，铁托匪帮加紧了对阿尔巴尼亚的污蔑，而巴黎的马歇尔化报纸则与之呼应。这是完全清楚的，即卖国贼铁托已与屠夫曹达利斯狼狈为奸。可靠消息证实：在七月十五日保皇法西斯军队曾通过南斯拉夫领土，以渗入希腊民主军军队的后方。
    德国民主报纸十四日对铁托集团的奸诈政策咸表忿怒。柏林苏占领区所有的报纸刊载苏联照会全文或详尽的摘要。新德意志报的标题为“铁托的两面手腕与叛逆”。国民日报写道：“铁托政府是苏联的敌人”。柏林日报以“铁托与邱吉尔”为题发表社论指出：苏联的复文淋漓尽致地暴露了南斯拉夫统治者的叛逆。柏林日报进一步强调：揭露南斯拉夫领袖和帝国主义国家的合作是极为重要的。该报继指出：如众周知，英国的较高级官员，包括臭名昭彰的反苏阴谋家邱吉尔的儿子，甚至在战时就和铁托有密切联系。在那时，英国供给铁托以武器。一九四四年一月，英军在希腊登陆，那时他们还不知道他们能不能够在那里坚持下去。因此，为了使萨罗尼加不落入希腊反法西斯分子之手，他们便把军火输给铁托在马其顿的走卒们。这里就发生了问题：铁托甚至在那时就承担了对英帝国主义的直接义务吗？邱吉尔甚至在那时就有理由把铁托当作帝国主义反苏阵营的盟友吗？该不是铁托及其党羽对国际民主运动的背叛和他目前与帝国主义结合的根源是在那里吧？”
