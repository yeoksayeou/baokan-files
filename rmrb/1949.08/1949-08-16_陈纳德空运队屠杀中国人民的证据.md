　　The pseudo “Directly Subordinate Air Transport Team of the Civil Aviation Bureau of the Ministry of Communications” was one of the military organizations used by the Kuomintang reactionary government in collusion with American imperialism to massacre the Chinese people. Its more well-known name was the "Chennault Air Transport Team." Under the guise of "civil aviation," it was jointly formed by Kuomintang war criminals Soong Mei-ling, Wu Tingchang, Yan Xishan, and American imperialist elements like Chennault, specifically for the purpose of exploiting and massacring the Chinese people. Chennault tried every possible means to cover up his crimes. On the eve of Shanghai's liberation, Darrneth, the director of the Shanghai office of this "Civil Aviation Corps," burned all incriminating documents under Chennault's orders. However, employees Shi Wentai and worker Chen Lianjing managed to preserve these documents. As a result, only one-tenth of the documents were burned, and the vast majority of the materials were preserved. The preserved documents contain ironclad evidence of the Chennault Air Transport Team's participation in the Kuomintang reactionaries' civil war against the Chinese people and their massacre of the Chinese people.
　　The most heinous crimes they committed were airlifting civil war munitions and military provisions for the Kuomintang bandit troops. During the Huaihai Campaign, the 300,000 bandit troops under the command of war criminal Du Yuming were surrounded in a small encirclement northeast of Yongcheng. Chennault airdropped a considerable amount of munitions and military provisions to them. According to the records in "Contract No. 144 for Airdrops from Nanjing to Xuzhou," the Chennault Air Transport Team's record of airdropping munitions and military provisions to the Du bandits from December 21st to 31st, 1948, for ten days was as follows: In terms of airlifting munitions, it flew 32 times from Nanjing to Xuzhou, transporting 236,861 pounds. In terms of airlifting military provisions, it flew 156 times from Nanjing to Xuzhou, transporting 1,270,191 pounds; it flew 3 times from Qingdao to Xuzhou, transporting 24,960 pounds. In early January of this year, Dai Wanguo, the head of the pseudo-Civil Aviation Bureau, sent a telegram to Chennault Air Transport Team stating: "The Ministry of National Defense orders that from January 4th to 8th, airdrops to General Du Yuming must be maintained at a minimum of 250 tons per day, with the Civil Aviation Air Transport Team allocated 80 tons." The "Semi-Monthly Journal of the Civil Aviation Air Transport Team," Volume 2, Issue 11, published by the team on March 1st, also openly admitted: "During the critical moment of the Xubeng Campaign (note: i.e., the Huaihai Campaign), the Civil Aviation Air Transport Team made its best efforts to carry out airdrop missions. During the one and a half months from November 23rd, 1948, to January 11th, 1949, the Civil Aviation Air Transport Team carried out the following airdrop and air transport missions: to the Xubeng area – a total of 37,136 soldiers, 135 tons of military equipment and ammunition, 1,496 tons of military rice and grain, and 5 tons of biscuits."
　　On April 16th, the "Civil Aviation Air Transport Team" also signed a memorandum of understanding with the pseudo-Joint Logistics Headquarters for "Airdropping to Taiyuan." On April 19th alone, it made seven round trips from Qingdao to Taiyuan, delivering 1,214 bags of military grain, totaling 59.73 tons. In order to conceal the crime of transporting munitions, "Air Transport Contract No. 178" signed by the "Civil Aviation Corps" and the pseudo "Fifth Supply Region Command of the Joint Logistics Department of the Ministry of National Defense" specifically stated: "Verbal agreements allow for the transport of munitions, but the receipts or waybills must state that they are for grain."
　　The Chennault Air Transport Team also used civil aviation transport planes to bomb the Chinese people. According to Chen Younian and Zhang Faya, the foremen of the "Radio Maintenance and Repair Shop of the Civil Aviation Air Transport Team," whenever the war situation was urgent and the Kuomintang bandit gang lacked bombers, Chennault ordered transport planes to perform the task of bombers, bombing the People's Liberation Army and the liberated areas. Taking the Weixian Campaign in Shandong as an example, the pseudo-Joint Logistics Headquarters sent five or six bomb pushers to the Chennault Air Transport Team, carrying bombs, to conduct bombings at night, launching bombing raids for six consecutive days. To prevent leaks, no co-pilots were on board, and no flight records were written. However, the radio had to be carried. These crimes were leaked from the radio.

　　陈纳德空运队屠杀中国人民的证据
    钟洛
    伪“交通部民用航空局直辖空运队”是国民党反动政府勾结美帝国主义屠杀中国人民的军事机构之一。它的更为人知的名称是“陈纳德空运队”。它在“民用航空”的名义下，由国民党战犯宋美龄、吴鼎昌、阎锡山和美帝国主义分子陈纳德等共同勾结组成，专门以剥削和屠杀中国人民为目的。陈纳德曾想尽一切办法来掩盖自己的罪行。在上海解放的前夜，这个“民航大队”的上海办事处主任达仑士，奉了陈纳德的命令，焚毁一切犯罪的证件。但该公司职员史文泰和工友陈莲菁却设法保存了这些证件，结果证件仅被烧去十分之一，绝大部分材料都被保存下来了。保存下来的文件中有着陈纳德空运队参加国民党反动派反对中国人民的内战、屠杀中国人民的铁证。
    他们干得最多的罪恶勾当，是为国民党匪军空运内战军火和军粮。淮海战役里，战犯杜聿明所部三十万匪军被围在永城东北一个小包围圈里，陈纳德曾给他空投了不少军火和军粮。根据“一四四号南京徐州空投合同”内的记载，“民航大队”从一九四八年十二月二十一日起至三十一日止的十天内陈纳德空运队为杜匪空投军火及军粮的纪录是：空运军火方面，由南京到徐州飞行三十二次，运了二三六、八六一磅。空运军粮方面，计由南京到徐州飞行一五六次，运了一、二七零、一九一磅；由青岛到徐州飞行三次，运了二四、九六零磅。今年一月上旬，伪民航局长戴宛国给陈纳德空运队打的电报中说：“国防部命令自一月四日开始至八日，对杜聿明将军空投每日须至少维持二五○吨，分配民航空运队八○吨。”三月一日该队出版的“民舫空运队半月刊”二卷十一期上，也公开承认：“徐蚌会战（按即淮海战役）危急之际，民航空运队曾尽最大努力执行空投任务。由一九四八年十一月二十三日起至一九四九年一月十一日止之一个半月间，民航空运队曾执行下列之空投及空运任务：往徐蚌地区——计开军队三七、一三六人，军械弹药一三五吨，军米粮食一、四九六吨，饼干五吨。”
    四月十六日“民航空运队”又和伪联勤总部签定了“空投太原”的备忘录。单只四月十九日一天从青岛到太原就往返七次，送去一、二一四口袋军粮，共重五九点七三吨。为了掩饰运输军火的罪行起见，“民航大队”和伪“国防部联勤第五补给区司令部”签订的“空运合同一七八号”特别注明：“口头合约可运军火，但于单据或运货单上则须注明为粮食”。
    陈纳德空运队并利用民航运输机轰炸中国人民。据“民航空运队无线电保养修理所”领班陈有年、张发亚两人揭露：每逢战局紧急而国民党匪帮又缺乏轰炸机的时候，陈纳德就令运输机执行轰炸机的任务，轰炸人民解放军及解放区。以山东潍县战役为例，伪联勤总部曾派了五六个推弹手到陈纳德空运队来，携带炸弹，在夜间进行轰炸，一连出动轰炸了六天。为了怕走漏消息，机上不带副驾驶员，不写飞行记录。但是无线电却不能不带。这些罪行就是从无线电里泄露出来的。【新华社上海十五日电】
