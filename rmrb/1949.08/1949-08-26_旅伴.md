　　Traveling Companions
    Panova
    (By Soviet writer Panova, translated by Su Ling, proofread by Cao Jinghua)
    Part One: Night
    Chapter One: Danilov
    He stood up and shoved his oily little hands into the pockets of his oily, wide trousers.
    "On the wall newspaper - it's Krachov. At the meeting - it's Krachov. On the disciplinary orders - it's Krachov again. I don't need this self-criticism. I'm telling you honestly. They say I'll fall under the wheels when I'm drunk. Me - fall under the wheels!" Krachov sneered viciously. "But you ask them: have we ever had a small accident in power generation? ... Now you take a look, do you say I'm drunk?"
    "A little," Danilov said cautiously.
    Krachov shook his head.
    "No, not a bit drunk, just right for the morning. Ha, as soon as it's break time, they come to sniff and see if I smell of alcohol, and then write down their opinions. Comrade Commissioner, to hell with them, of course, if you can accommodate me, take me with you."
    They looked at each other. Krachov's gaze was cold and confident, and Danilov's gaze was also cold and confident.
    "I'll take you," Danilov said.
    After settling Krachov's matter, he went to the station. In the distance, on the tracks, next to a long gray fence, stood a row of bright, new cars: fifteen deep green carriages painted with red crosses, a freight car, and a small yellow refrigerated car. A Red Army soldier stood guard with a gun.
    The commander was in the commander's car. He was walking in the corridor, the keys jingling. A large bunch of keys hung on his bent elbow. Sunlight streamed in from the windows, giving off a smell of hot paint. The commander's wrinkled, sweaty face showed a happy expression.
    "Look!" he said, showing Danilov the bunch of keys. "The keys to open all doors, the keys to open all hearts, are all here."
    "Is everything ready?" Danilov asked.
    "Ha, what do you think!" the commander said. "You know, when the cars were handed over there, the entire committee was there to check everything."
    "Did you check everything?"
    "Me? ... Yes."
    Danilov stared at him intently, then lowered his head.
    He didn't check anything. They handed him the bunch of keys, he signed the receipt book, then climbed into the commander's car, hitched it to the engine, the commander got on the car, and it drove away. He sat alone in seventeen carriages, he felt it was great fun. The train stopped right next to the gray fence. The engine whistled and drove off, the commander paced back and forth in the corridor, waiting impatiently for Danilov. He already felt a liking for Danilov.

    第一部　夜
    第一章　达尼洛夫
    他站起来，把油污的两只小手，插到油污的宽裤子的口袋里。
    “在壁报上——是克拉错夫。在会议上——是克拉错夫。在训诫的命令上——又是克拉错夫。我不需要这些自我批评的。我老实告诉你。他们说我会在喝醉的时候，倒在轮子底下。我——倒在轮子底下吗！”克拉错夫毒恶的冷笑了一声。“可是你问一问他们：在发电上我们有过一次小小的失事吗？……现在你看一看吧，你说我喝醉了吗？”
    “有一点儿，”达尼洛夫谨慎小心的说着。
    克拉错夫摇了摇头。
    “不，一点也没醉，按早晨的时候说，恰合适呢。呵，一到休息的时候，他们就来闻一闻看我有没有酒气，然后就写出自己的意见来。委员同志，去他的吧，当然，假如你那儿能安置我的话，就把我带去吧。”
    他们面面相顾着。克拉错夫的眼光是冷淡而自信，达尼洛夫的眼光也是冷淡而自信。
    “我带你去，”达尼洛夫说。
    把克拉错夫的事弄妥之后，他就上车站去了。在远远的轨道上，在一堵很长的灰色的篱墙旁边，停着一列明光发亮的新车：十五辆漆着红十字的深绿色的车厢，一辆货车厢和一辆黄色的小小的冷藏车。一个红军兵士，执枪守护着。
    司令在司令车上。他在走廊里走着，钥匙在哗哗喇喇的响着。一大串钥匙，挂在他的弯着的肘弯上。阳光从窗子里射进来，发着一股晒热的油漆味。司令的满是皱纹的汗脸，表现着很幸福的神气。
    “瞧吧！”他说着，把一串钥匙给达尼洛夫看。“开一切门的钥匙，开一切人心的钥匙，都在这里呵。”
    “一切都就绪了吗？”达尼洛夫问道。
    “呵，你想怎么样！”司令说。“你晓得，那儿在交车的时候，委员会全班人马当场点交呢。”
    “一切你都查看了吗？”
    “我吗？………是的。”
    达尼洛夫凝神的把他望了一眼，便低下头来。
    他什么也没有查看。那儿把一串钥匙交给他，他在收到簿上签了字，就钻到司令车里，挂上车头，司令坐到车上就开走了，他一个人坐了十七辆车厢，他觉得很好玩。列车在灰色的篱墙紧跟前停起来。车头叫了一声就走开了，司令就在走廊里来回踱着方步，烦躁的等待着达尼洛夫。他已经觉对得达尼洛夫发生好感了。
