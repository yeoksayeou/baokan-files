    [Ping City News] International affairs expert Hu Yuzhi gave a radio address on the evening of August 8th, the fourth anniversary of the Soviet Union's entry into the war against Japan, on the New China Broadcasting Station in Peiping, entitled "Sino-Soviet Cooperation to Defend Pacific Peace." The full text is as follows:
    Today is the fourth anniversary of the Soviet Union's entry into the war against Japan. Four years ago today, the heroic Soviet Red Army, together with the Mongolian People's Army, used overwhelming power to launch a three-pronged attack on the border of the puppet Manchuria. With the cooperation of the people of Northeast China, they annihilated and captured 764,000 of the main force of the Japanese imperialist Kwantung Army within a week. The Northeast, which had been forcibly occupied by Japan for fourteen years, along with Lushun and Dalian, which had been ruled by Japan for forty years, were liberated. Japanese imperialism announced its unconditional surrender on August 14, and the Far East War ended.
    In retrospect, this is an old event from four years ago. But from the perspective of Sino-Soviet relations and the current situation in the Pacific, this is still a major event of paramount importance worthy of solemn commemoration today.
    Why? If we imagine that the Soviet Union had not participated in the war against Japan four years ago, what would have been the result? First, the war would not have ended so quickly. Even if the United States had used atomic bombs to bomb the Japanese mainland, Japan could still have used Northeast China and North China as bases for continued operations. Moreover, even if Japan had been defeated, the liberation of the people of Northeast China and all of China would have encountered even greater difficulties. Because, if that had been the case, American imperialism would certainly have occupied the Northeast, just as it currently occupies South Korea. The liberation of the people of the Northeast would have been delayed for a long time. Without the liberation of the Northeast, the liberation of all of China would naturally have been delayed. In short, without the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops, Japan might not have surrendered. Even if Japan had surrendered, a large part of China would have temporarily become like present-day South Korea and the Philippines, temporarily becoming a colony of American imperialism. It would not have been easy for the people of the Northeast and the whole country to achieve victory as quickly as they have today.
    The reactionary elements in China, the running dogs of American imperialism, regard American imperialism as their savior. They propagate that the defeat of Japanese fascism was solely due to the two atomic bombs, and that the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops did not play a decisive role in the war situation. That is all blatant lies against their conscience. Because everyone understands that if the Soviet people had not resisted and defeated the German army in the West with a high degree of sacrifice, the United States and Britain would never have been able to launch a counter-offensive against Japan. After Germany surrendered, if the Soviet Union had not participated in the war against Japan and annihilated the powerful main force of the Japanese army, the Kwantung Army of more than one million, the war would not have ended so quickly.
    In the past few years, the reactionary elements in China have repeatedly made anti-Soviet clamors, falsely accusing the Soviet Union of violating the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and infringing upon the territorial sovereignty of Northeast China.
    However, the Soviet Union's sincere friendship towards the Chinese people cannot be concealed by the reactionaries' rumors. Hasn't the truth of the past four years been very clear? Who wants to turn China into a colony? Who is establishing aggressive bases for the navy and air force in China? Who is infringing upon China's inland river navigation rights? Who sent warships into the Yangtze River and bombarded the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people? Who used more than 4.6 billion US dollars to help Chiang Kai-shek attack the Chinese people? Who supported Chiang Kai-shek's blockade of the liberated areas' seaports? Aren't these bad things done by British and American imperialism?
    On the contrary, the Soviet Union never infringes upon China's territorial sovereignty, never interferes in China's internal affairs, and never violates the treaties it has signed. Moreover, only the Soviet Union quickly withdrew its troops stationed in Northeast China in accordance with the agreement. The Soviet Union fully abides by the treaty regarding Lushun, Dalian, and the Changchun Railway, respects China's sovereignty and the interests of the Chinese people, and helps China's construction. Precisely because of this, imperialism and the reactionary elements in China do not like the Soviet Union and are trying desperately to oppose it. What do imperialism and the reactionary elements in China hate the most about the Soviet Union? That is the Soviet Union's adherence to the first word of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship: the Soviet Union will never interfere in China's internal affairs. Therefore, the Soviet Union does not, like the United States, use US dollars, munitions, airplanes, warships, or military advisors to help Chiang Kai-shek and transport troops to Northeast China to carry out an anti-people civil war. The Soviet Union does not, like the United States, try every possible means to make Northeast China an American colony (regarding this matter, American imperialism has recently admitted it without being forced to do so. The White Paper published in Washington admits that the Wedemeyer Report contained a plan to place Northeast China under the trusteeship of the United Nations, which would in fact be occupied by the United States. However, the US State Department did not dare to implement it because it was afraid of opposition from the Chinese people).
    In short, the Soviet Union fully abides by the letter and spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, does not interfere in China's internal affairs, and allows the Chinese people to handle their own domestic problems. This is what American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek are most unwilling to see. Although American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek are unwilling, the Chinese people are willing. From many years of experience, the Chinese people fully understand that only the Soviet Union is China's true friend. The Soviet Union never participates in China's civil war and never uses money or weapons to supply any side in the civil war. However, the Soviet Union's just stance and loyal friendship towards the Chinese people have truly helped the Chinese people.
    Therefore, today, when we think of the old events of four years ago, we must thank the Soviet Union for helping the Chinese people obtain final liberation from the hands of the Japanese invaders. The victorious success of the Chinese people's liberation cause is, of course, due to the Chinese people themselves, but without the Soviet Union's genuine moral assistance and non-interference policy, the Chinese people's liberation cause would not have been so smooth in achieving victory.
    Today, the Chinese people's liberation cause is about to be completed, and the whole country will soon be liberated. Especially in the new Northeast, production and construction are rapidly recovering and developing. Democratic Northeast China and the Soviet Union have signed a trade agreement based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, which is welcomed by the people of all China. This agreement greatly helps the economic construction and industrialization of Democratic Northeast China and is in sharp contrast to the economic plunder of China by imperialism in the past. Soon after the establishment of the new China's people's democratic government, the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union will cooperate closely like brothers, as Mr. Sun Yat-sen hoped on his deathbed. In peaceful construction, the new democratic China will certainly receive greater help from the socialist Soviet Union, both spiritually and materially. The more imperialism hopes that we and the Soviet Union will be far apart, the closer we must be to the Soviet Union. We will definitely not do what the enemy likes, and we will definitely do what the enemy fears. As Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party said, we must lean to one side. We must stand on the side of the world's democratic and peaceful camp led by the Soviet Union. Is there any need for the independent and liberated new Chinese people to collude with imperialist aggressors? Is it possible to rely on imperialism? It is absolutely impossible.
    Not only can we not rely on imperialism, but we must also strictly guard against new provocations by imperialism. Although imperialism has been defeated by the Chinese people, it will come back and will not give up. Look! Chiang Kai-shek, the number one running dog of American imperialism, Quirino, the number two running dog, and Syngman Rhee, the number three running dog, under the orders of their American master, are they not engaging in the trick of a "Pacific Anti-Communist Pact" again? Of course, there is no need to be afraid of this. The Kuomintang reactionaries' five million troops and more than 4.6 billion US dollars in aid did not save Chiang Kai-shek's life. Can three clay idols put together create anything significant? Even so, imperialists will not give up until they reach the Yellow River. The Pacific will not have a single day of peace until the entire imperialist system is eliminated from the world. To defend the peace of the Pacific and prevent new aggression by imperialism, we must rely on the strength of the people of China and other Pacific countries in the future, and even more on the strength of the Soviet Union. The most important thing is the friendly cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. Defending the peace of the Pacific is the common responsibility of the people of China and the Soviet Union today!
    Four years ago, the people of China and the Soviet Union fought side by side and finally eliminated the stubborn Japanese aggressors, laying a preliminary foundation for the peace of the Pacific. Today, the strength of the Chinese people and the world's people is more than ten or a hundred times greater than it was four years ago. The imperialist aggressors, on the other hand, are more cowardly and isolated than before. If the socialist Soviet Union and the new democratic China cooperate closely and jointly assume the responsibility of defending the peace of the Pacific, the strength of 675 million people, plus the strength of all the oppressed nations in the Pacific, will be invincible. If the imperialists dare to launch an adventurous aggression, they will inevitably suffer the consequences, just like the Japanese aggressors four years ago.

### 苏对日参战四周年纪念日胡愈之播讲  中苏合作保卫太平洋和平

    苏对日参战四周年纪念日胡愈之播讲
    中苏合作保卫太平洋和平
    【平市讯】国际问题专家胡愈之，于八日晚苏联对日参战四周年纪念日在北平新华广播电台广播讲演，题为“中苏合作保卫太平洋和平”，全文如下：
    今天是苏联对日参战的四周年纪念日。在四年前的今天，英勇无比的苏联红军会同外蒙古军队，用了排山倒海的威力，分三路向伪满边境进攻，在东北人民配合之下，在一星期之内，歼灭并且俘虏了日本帝国主义的主力关东军七十六万四千人。被日本强占十四年之久的东北连同日本统治四十年之久的旅顺大连，从此得到解放。日本帝国主义于八月十四日宣布无条件投降，远东大战结束。
    说起来，这是一件四年前的旧事情。但从中苏两国关系来讲，从太平洋的目前形势来讲，直到今天，这还是一件有头等重要意义值得郑重纪念的大事情。
    为什么？假如我们设想，在四年以前，苏联不参加对日作战，那会有怎样的结果呢？首先战争不会这样快结束。美国即使用原子弹轰炸日本本土，日本依然可以用东北华北作为根据地继续作战。而且即使日本打败了，东北人民以及全中国人民的解放，也会遇到更大的困难。因为，如果那样，美帝国主义一定会占领东北，象在目前占领南朝鲜一样。东北人民的解放就要延迟到很久以后。东北不解放，全中国的解放当然也就要延迟。总而言之，没有苏联出兵，日本未必就投降。日本即使投降，中国也会有大部分领土暂时变成目前的南朝鲜和菲律宾，暂时成为美帝国主义的殖民地。东北以及全国人民，要象今天这样迅速地得到胜利，那就不容易。
    中国国内反动派，美帝国主义的走狗们，把美帝国主义当做他们的救命王菩萨，他们宣传说：打败日本法西斯，只是依靠两枚原子弹的功劳，苏联出兵对于战局并不起决定作用。那全是昧着良心瞎说。因为谁都明白，假如不是苏联人民用高度的牺牲精神，在西方抵抗并且击败希特勒大军的进攻，那么，美国和英国决不可能向日本进行反攻。德国投降之后，要不是苏联对日参战，把日本的强大主力一百多万关东军加以歼灭，战争也决不会这样快结束的。
    中国国内反动派在过去几年来，曾经屡次作反苏的叫嚣。诬蔑苏联违反中苏友好条约，侵犯东北领土主权。
    但是苏联对于中国人民的热诚友谊，却不是反动派的谣言所能够掩盖的。这四年来的事实，不已经很明白吗？是谁要把中国变成殖民地呢？是谁在中国建立海空军的侵略基地呢？是谁侵犯中国的内河航权呢？是谁把军舰开进了长江，炮轰人民解放军和中国老百姓呢？是谁用了四十六万万多美元帮助蒋介石进攻中国人民呢？是谁支持蒋介石封锁解放区海口呢？难道这些坏事不是美英帝国主义所做的吗？
    正相反，苏联从不侵犯中国领土主权，苏联从不干涉中国内政，苏联从不违反它所签订的条约，而且只有苏联按照协定迅速撤退驻东北的军队。苏联对于旅顺大连和长春铁路，完全遵守条约，尊重中国主权和中国人民的利益，帮助中国的建设。正因为这样，所以帝国主义和中国国内反动派不欢喜苏联，并且要拼命反对苏联。帝国主义和中国国内反动派对苏联所最恼恨的是什么呢？那就是苏联信守中苏友好条约的第一个字，苏联决不干涉中国内政。因此苏联就不象美国那样，用美元，用军火，用飞机，用军舰，用军事顾问，去帮助蒋介石，运送军队到东北进行反人民的内战。苏联更不象美国那样，千方百计地要把东北作为美国殖民地（关于这件事，最近美帝国主义已经不打自招了。华盛顿发表的白皮书，承认魏德迈报告书中曾有一项计划，将东北归联合国托管，事实上是由美国占领。但美国国务院却因为害怕中国人民反对，所以不敢执行。）。
    总之，苏联完全遵守中苏友好条约的文字和精神，不干涉中国内政，让中国人民自己处理国内问题，这就是美帝国主义和蒋介石所最不愿意的。美帝国主义和蒋介石虽然不愿意，但中国人民是愿意的。中国人民从许多年以来的经验，完全明白，只有苏联才是中国真正的朋友。苏联从来不参加中国的内战，从来不用金钱或武器来供给内战的任何方面。但是苏联的正义立场和对于中国人民的忠诚友谊，却实实在在帮助了中国人民。
    所以在今天，想起了四年前的旧事，我们要感谢苏联，它帮助中国人民从日本侵略者的手中得到了最后的解放。中国人民解放事业的胜利成功，固然是靠中国人民自己，但是没有苏联的真正的道义的援助和不干涉内政的政策，中国人民解放事业，得到胜利成功，决不会如此之顺利。
    在今天中国人民解放事业，已快要完成，全国就要解放。特别是在人民的新东北，生产建设正在迅速恢复和发展。民主东北和苏联根据平等互利的原则，已经签订了贸易协定，这是全中国人民所欢迎的。这种协定大大地帮助了民主东北的经济建设和工业化的进展。和过去帝国主义对中国的经济掠夺刚成了尖锐的对照。不久以后，新中国的人民民主政府成立，中苏两大国一定会象孙中山先生临终所期望的那样，亲兄弟似地密切合作。在和平建设中，新民主主义的中国一定能够得到社会主义的苏联的更大的帮助，无论在精神方面或者物质方面都是一样。帝国主义越是希望我们和苏联离得远些，我们就越要和苏联靠得紧些。敌人所喜欢的我们就一定不做，敌人所害怕的我们就一定要做。正如中共毛主席所说，我们就是要一面倒。我们是一定站在苏联所领导的世界民主和平阵营这一边的。独立解放后的新中国人民难道还有必要和帝国主义侵略者勾勾搭搭吗？难道还能够依靠帝国主义吗？是绝对没有可能的。
    我们不但不能倚靠帝国主义，而且我们还必须严防帝国主义的新的挑衅行为。帝国主义虽然在中国人民面前吃了败仗，但它是要卷土重来的，它是不会甘休的。看罢！美帝国主义的第一号走狗蒋介石，第二号走狗季里诺，和第三号走狗李承晚，奉了美国主子的命令，不是又在搞什么“太平洋反共公约”的鬼把戏吗？自然罗，这是不必怕的。国民党反动派五百万军队和四十六亿多美援，并没有救蒋介石的命，难道三尊泥菩萨凑拢在一起，就能搞出什么明堂来吗？虽然如此，帝国主义者是不到黄河心不死的。整个帝国主义制度不从世界上消灭，太平洋就不会有一天太平。要保卫太平洋的和平，防止帝国主义的新的侵略，今后要依靠中国以及太平洋各国人民的力量，更要依靠苏联的力量，而最要紧的是中苏两大国间的友好合作。保卫太平洋和平，今天是中苏两国人民的共同的责任！
    在四年前，中苏两大国人民并肩作战，终于消灭了顽强的日本侵略者，奠定了太平洋和平的初步基础，在今天，中国人民和世界人民的力量，比四年前，强大到何止十倍百倍。帝国主义侵略者却比以前更怯弱，更孤立了。要是社会主义的苏联和新民主主义的中国，密切合作，共同负起保卫太平洋和平的责任，六万万七千五百万人民的力量，再加上太平洋一切被压迫民族的力量，是所向无敌的。帝国主义者要是敢于发动冒险的侵略，必然要自食其果，如同四年前的日本侵略者一样。
