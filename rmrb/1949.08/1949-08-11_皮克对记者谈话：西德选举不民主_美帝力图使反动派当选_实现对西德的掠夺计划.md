Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: Berlin dispatch: Neues Deutschland published on the 6th a statement by Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, to reporters commenting on the West German parliamentary elections. Pieck pointed out that this election has nothing in common with true democracy. U.S. imperialists are trying to elect reactionary West German parties by deceiving voters and persecuting communists, in order to realize their increasingly large-scale plundering plan for West Germany, turning West Germany into its colony and military base in Europe. The people of West Germany have the opportunity to widely unite all progressive and truly patriotic forces within the All-German Front, although these forces are suffering the most severe opposition, and the entire firestorm of slander, persecution, and direct terror is aimed at them.

Pieck criticized the election programs of the German Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party, saying that these programs are masterpieces of cunning and deception. Those who support and endorse the Marshall Plan, those who advocate the establishment of a divided West German state, must bear full responsibility for the increasing poverty and economic instability. Pieck discussed the growth of the All-German Front in West Germany, saying that although the All-German Front is still in its initial stages, it has received a wide response in West Germany. This has been proven by the demands put forward by West German workers and employers for German economic unification and the immediate resumption of trade relations with East Germany. Many West German enterprise delegations, including workers, technicians, and employers, requested the German Economic Commission in Berlin to conduct East-West German economic negotiations there. These negotiations were sabotaged by the Frankfurt Economic Council, and the resulting protests and indignation are growing.

Pieck spoke about the position of the West German Communist Party in the election campaign, saying that the West German Communist Party's election program provides clear and precise answers to the major problems facing the German people. The demands of the Communist Party are consistent with those of all truly patriotic Germans. Their demands are: the unification of Germany, the immediate conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the withdrawal of occupying forces, a fundamental improvement in the living standards of the working people, ensuring the independent survival of workers, farmers, and employers, friendship with the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, and international peace and understanding.

    皮克对记者谈话：西德选举不民主
    美帝力图使反动派当选
    实现对西德的掠夺计划
    【新华社北平十日电】柏林讯：新德意志报六日发表德国统一社会党主席皮克对记者评论西德议会选举的谈话。皮克指出：这一选举与真正的民主毫无相同之处。美帝国主义者正在力图借欺诈选民及迫害共产党人的手段，来使西德反动党派当选以实现其规模越来越大的对西德的掠夺计划，把西德变为它在欧洲的殖民地与军事基地。西德人民有可能广泛地将一切进步及真正爱国的力量统一在全德阵线之内，虽然这些力量遭受着最严重的反对，而且整个诽谤迫害及直接恐怖的火网都在针对着他们。
    皮克批评德国基督教民主党及社会民主党的选举纲领称：这些纲领是狡诈与欺骗的杰作。那些拥护及赞同马歇尔政策的人，那些赞成建立西德分裂国家的人，要对日益增长的贫困与经济不稳定负完全责任。皮克论及全德阵线在西德成长的情形称：虽然全德阵线尚在初创阶段，但他在西德已得到广泛的响应。这已在西德工人与雇主所提出的要求德国经济统一及立即恢复与东德的贸易关系中得到证明。西德许多企业代表团，包括工人、技师与雇主，要求柏林的德国经济委员会在该地进行东、西德经济谈判。这些谈判受到法兰克福经济委员会的破坏，因而激起的抗议与愤慨正在增长。
    皮克谈到西德共产党在竞选斗争中的立场时称：西德共产党的竞选纲领对德国人所面临的重大问题，作了明白而确切的答复。共产党的要求是和一切真正热爱祖国的德国人相一致的。他们的要求是：德国的统一，立即缔结对德和约，撤退占领军，根本改善劳动人民的生活水平，保障工人、农民及雇主的独立生存，与苏联及各人民民主国家友好，以及国际间的和平与谅解。
