    Electricity Thieves Continue Automatic Registration
    Lian Kuoru and Others Participate in Anti-Electricity Theft Propaganda
    [This Municipality News] Since the North China Electric Power Company's Beijing Branch launched its anti-electricity theft campaign, as of the day before yesterday (August 1st), 22 electricity thieves have voluntarily registered with the company. In addition, the Public Security Bureau has uncovered nine electricity-stealing households, and 40 electricity-stealing households have been reported through various channels. Furthermore, 463 households have applied to the branch company for meter installation, and the company will install them sequentially. Among these voluntarily registered households, 17-year-old worker Wu Guoqiang, who enjoyed playing with radios before March of this year, had engaged in electricity theft. After reading the propaganda documents of the anti-electricity theft campaign, he wrote a letter to the branch company to confess his mistake of stealing electricity. Yang Zhenya of 17 Doufu Lane also wrote to the branch company, saying: "In the past, during the Kuomintang rule, I thought that stealing electricity and using electric stoves was a bargain; after liberation, I realized that all public utilities belong to the people, and stealing electricity is equivalent to stealing the people's property." He also requested the company to disclose his letter as a punishment for him and to educate other electricity thieves.
    To assist the anti-electricity theft campaign, Hou Baolin, Hou Yichen, Cao Baolu, Ma Sanli, Lian Kuoru, and other figures from the Beijing Quyi (Chinese folk art forms) circles have voluntarily participated in street propaganda from August 2nd to 4th. The Anti-Electricity Theft Campaign Committee is preparing to conduct a general inspection. Many workers from the branch company have volunteered to participate, and it is expected that the general inspection of electricity users in the urban area will begin after the propaganda work concludes on August 8th.

    窃电户续自动登记
    连阔如等参加反窃电宣传
    【本市讯】华北电业公司北平分公司自从展开反窃电运动宣传以后，截至前日（一日）止已有二十二户窃电者向公司自动登记，此外经公安局检查出九家窃电户，经各方面告密检举出四十家窃电户，另外还有四六三户到分公司申请装表，公司均将依次陆续予以按装。在这些自动登记户中，十七岁的工友吴国强，在今年三月以前爱玩弄无线电，曾有过窃电的行为，他看了反窃电运动的宣传文件后，已经写信给分公司检讨他窃电的错误。豆腐巷十七号杨振亚，也写信给分公司说：“过去我在国民党统治时期，自以为偷电、用电炉子是检便宜；解放后我认识到一切公用事业都是人民的，我窃电就是等于偷窃人民的财产。”他又请公司将他的信披露，作为对他的惩戒，并借以教育别的窃电户。
    北平曲艺界侯宝林、侯一尘、曹宝禄、马三立、连阔如等为了协助反窃电运动，特自动的从八月二日起，至四日止参加街头宣传。反窃电运动委员会正准备做普遍检查工作，分公司的工友已有许多人自动报名愿意参加，预计本月八日宣传工作告一段落后，即可开始市区内用电户的普检工作。（天奕）
