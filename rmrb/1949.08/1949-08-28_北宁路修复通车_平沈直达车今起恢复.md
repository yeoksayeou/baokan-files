    [Report from this city] The section of the Beining Railway outside the pass that was damaged by floods, along with the Daling River railway bridge, has been fully repaired by the tireless efforts of Northeast railway workers working day and night in the rain. A test run was conducted at 10:30 PM on the 26th, with excellent results. The direct train service to Pingjin, which had been interrupted for twenty days, is scheduled to resume today (August 28th). There will be two to three pairs of direct express trains running daily between Beiping and Shenyang.
