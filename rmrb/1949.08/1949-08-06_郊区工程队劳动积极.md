    Suburban Engineering Team
    Actively Labors
    [This City News] The workers of the Construction Bureau's suburban engineering team demonstrated a new work ethic in the construction of the Yi-Xiang Highway. When the Second Suburban Team was repairing Qinglongqiao Street, the street surface was more than 960 square feet, and it was planned to take six days to complete. In order to ensure passage by "July 1st," they worked from 5:00 AM to 7:00 PM every day, without resting after lunch, and completed the work in three and a half days. On July 27th, the First Suburban Team repaired the Five-Arch Bridge under Yuquan Mountain. Because the bridge surface was very narrow, traffic had to be cut off during the construction period. After discussion, the workers got up at 2:00 AM to start the fire, began boiling water at 4:00 AM, and worked until 10:00 AM, completing the bridge surface which was 15 meters long and 4.5 meters wide, totaling 70 square meters, ensuring that cars could pass. Only then did everyone go back to eat breakfast, and no one complained of being hungry.

    郊区工程队
    劳动积极
    【本市讯】建设局郊区工程队的工人们在这次修筑颐香公路的工程中表现了新的劳动态度。郊二分队在修青龙桥街的时候，街面九百六十多平方尺，计划六天才能完成，他们为了保证“七一”能够通行，每天从早晨五点多钟一直工作到晚上七点多钟，中午吃完饭也不休息，三天半就完了工。郊一分队上月二十七日修筑玉泉山下五孔桥，因为桥面很窄，修筑时间内要切断交通，工人们经过讨论以后，夜里两点钟就起来生火，四点开锅，一直工作到十点钟，完成了十五米长四米半宽共七十平方公尺的桥面，保证了汽车可以通过，然后大家才回去吃早饭，没有一个人嚷肚子饿。
