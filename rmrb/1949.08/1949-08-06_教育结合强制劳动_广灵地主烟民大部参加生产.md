    Education Combined with Forced Labor
    Most Landlords and Opium Addicts in Guangling Participate in Production
    [This newspaper, Chahar News] The work of reforming landlords, opium addicts, and idlers in Guangling County has achieved initial success. Out of 778 landlords and opium addicts (adult males) in the county, 630 have participated in labor after education and reformation. The main method of reform is the combination of education and forced labor. Cadres in Xijiaoshan Village divided the work; the director of the farmers' association led the landlord Wang Shixun in production, and the branch secretary Zhang Qingxi was responsible for reforming landlords like Wang Fengyi. Under the active education and reformation of the village cadres, the landlords felt that participating in labor was the only way out and began to learn production. Wang Xiaokuan, a landlord in the village, said while weeding this year, "From now on, I have to work for myself; it won't work to just eat like before." Tong Cunpu, a landlord in Xiliulaoding, and his whole family participated in production. The 31 mu of land left to him were all used for raising seeds during the labor mobilization, and the first weeding has been completed. The remaining 148 people who did not participate in labor either had illnesses or were not mobilized by the masses to seriously reform them. In the county, there are a total of 1,180 opium addicts, loafers, and idlers. Some of them, after expressing their grievances and receiving land during the land reform movement, had their class consciousness raised and were determined to quit their opium habits, abandon their evil ways, and participate in labor. Wang Shouxin of Xijiaoshan is one such example. Many others have also been reformed in drug rehabilitation centers through education combined with forced labor. In short, meetings, education, persuasion and criticism through social connections, combined with coercion, and turning their reformation into a mass movement, are the only ways to achieve effective results. Currently, 957 opium addicts and idlers in the county have been reformed. In Shaquan Village in the Second District, there were originally 73 opium addicts. After the drug rehabilitation center's reform, only five people's opium addiction has not been completely broken. In Xijiadou, 23 opium addicts, loafers, and idlers have all been reformed except for four. The 223 people who have not been reformed are mostly habitual vagrants and require a longer period of reformation. In the process, some village party members and cadres are not concerned about this work, fearing to offend people and fearing retaliation from loafers, and let them go unchecked. Efforts are being made to improve their understanding in order to solve this problem.
    There are many opium addicts and hooligans in the new district of Ying County. Incidents of theft, robbery, and disruption of social order are mostly committed by these people. To this end, the county government established a labor re-education center to force them to seek reformation through labor. In June, 13 opium addicts were successfully detoxified and released from the center. The families of opium addicts are very satisfied with this method. The number of fathers sending their sons and wives sending their husbands to quit opium and reform is increasing daily. The county government is forcing opium addicts to quit opium while closely organizing anti-smuggling efforts. In the past six months, more than 100 people involved in trafficking opium and raw opium have been arrested. Fifty of these criminals have been reformed after labor re-education, and currently, 170 are still in the center undergoing reformation.

    教育结合强制劳动
    广灵地主烟民大部参加生产
    【本报察哈尔讯】广灵县改造地主、烟民、懒汉的工作已获初步成绩。全县地主、烟民七百七十八人（男成年），经过教育改造参加劳动的六百三十人。改造的办法，主要是教育与强制劳动相结合。西蕉山村干部进行了分工，农会主任带动地主王世勋生产，支书张清喜负责改造地主王凤义等。在村干部积极教育改造下，地主们感到只有参加劳动才是出路，也开始学习生产。该村地主王孝宽，今年锄苗时对人说：“今后得自刨自吃了，象以前那样儿吃不开了。”西留老町地主仝存朴，全家都参加了生产。留给他的三十一亩地，都是在拨工中养种的，现已锄过了头遍。其余的一百四十八人没有参加劳动的，有的是因病，有的是没把群众发动起来，认真改造他们。全县共有烟民、二流子、懒汉等一千一百八十人，其中一部分人，在土地改革运动中经过翻心诉苦并分得土地阶级觉悟提高，决心戒除烟瘾，改邪归正，参加劳动。西蕉山的王守信就是这样的。其余在戒烟所教育结合强制劳动中改造了的也很多。总之，会议教育、通过社会关系规劝与批评、强制结合、把改造他们造成群众性的运动，才易收到效果。现全县已有烟民懒汉等九百五十七人得到改造。二区莎泉村原有烟民七十三人，经戒烟所改造后，只剩五人烟瘾还没有戒清。西加斗二十三个烟民、二流子、懒汉，除四人外，都已改造过来。没改造过来的二百二十三人，大部分是流氓成性的，需要费较长时期改造。进行中还有些村的党员、干部对这一工作不关心怕惹人，怕二流子报复而放任不管，现正在提高他们的认识中求得解决。
    应县新区烟民、流氓很多，偷盗、抢劫、破坏社会秩序的事件，多是这些人干的。为此，县政府成立了劳动教习所，强制他们从劳动中求得改造。六月份即有十三个烟民断瘾出所。烟民家属对这办法很满意，父送子、妻送夫前来戒烟和改造的日有增加。县政府一面强制烟民戒烟，一面则严密组织缉私。半年来，查获贩运大烟、料面的人犯百余人。这些人犯先后经过劳动教习所改造的已有五十余人，目前尚有百七十人正入所改造中。
