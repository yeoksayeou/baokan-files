Taihang District Ordered to Merge
  All Systems Have Completed Handover
  Taihang Xinhua Daily Also Ceases Publication
    [Taihang Telegram] In order to adapt to the new changes in the situation, the North China regional divisions have been readjusted, and the Taihang Liberated Area has been ordered to merge. In the past half month, various agencies have held meetings to summarize their work and conduct handovers. For example, the District Party Committee Office comprehensively introduced the general appearance and situation of various places, as well as current problems, to relevant parties. The warehouse section of the Administrative Office's Finance Department, in its handover document, not only proposed future warehouse construction plans and cadre staffing issues but also drew diagrams for the handover. Other agencies also printed various forms, categorized and meticulously registered them, and wrote handover documents. The handover work has now been successfully completed, and all agencies will cease operations immediately, with only a joint retained office established to handle all remaining issues.
    [Taihang Telegram] Due to the adjustment of administrative divisions in North China, the Taihang Xinhua Daily has also been ordered to cease publication officially on the 20th of this month and published an editorial in its final issue on the 19th. It explained that the current adjustment of administrative divisions is the glorious achievement of our Party, government, army, and people's decades of struggle. Now that the Taihang District has been respectively assigned to Hebei, Shanxi, and Pingyuan provinces, cadres and the masses in our entire district should consciously unite with the cadres and masses of other districts, respect each other, learn from each other's strengths, and do our work well.

　　太行区奉命合并
  　各系统已移交完毕
  　太行新华日报同时终刊
    【太行电】为适应新的形势变化，华北区划重新调整，太行解放区已奉命合并。半月来，各机关分别召开会议总结工作，并进行移交。如区党委办公室将各地一般面貌、情况及当前的问题等，均向有关方面做了综合介绍。行署财政处仓库科，在移交书内，不但提出了今后建库计划、干部编制问题，并绘制成图进行移交。其他各机关亦印制了各种表册，分门别类详细登记，并写出移交书。移交工作现已胜利完成，各机关即行停止办公，仅设一联合留守办事处，专门处理一切遗留问题。
    【太行电】由于华北行政区划调整，太行新华日报也奉命于本月二十日正式停刊，并于十九日终刊号上发表社论。说明此次行政区划的调整，是我党政军民十数年奋斗的光辉成果。现太行区已分别归划河北、山西、平原等省，我全区干部群众应自觉地与其他区的干部群众团结一致，相互尊重，取长补短，做好工作。
