    The North China People's Government Ministry of Civil Affairs
    Convenes Meeting on Supporting the Military
    Discussing the Livelihoods of Poor Revolutionary Martyrs' Families and Military Dependents, and Other Issues
    [This Newspaper's Report] The North China People's Government Ministry of Civil Affairs convened a meeting on supporting the military on July 28th. Participants included representatives from the Political Department and Supply Department of the North China Military Region, the Political Department of the 20th Army Corps, the Organization Department of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau, and responsible persons from various administrative offices, provinces, and cities. The meeting was presided over by Lan Gongwu, Vice Chairman of the North China People's Government and Minister of Civil Affairs. The meeting focused on proposing and discussing solutions to the livelihoods of poor revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, and workers' families, as well as issues such as the enrollment of poor revolutionary martyrs' and military dependents' children, the implementation of preferential policies for the military, and the connection between local governments and the military. Regarding the solution to the livelihoods of poor revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, and workers' families, it was unanimously agreed that in rural areas, the work of supporting the military mainly involves the issue of substitute farming. Currently, due to the reduction of military service, substitute farming should be improved in the future and must be integrated as part of the overall large-scale production work to strengthen leadership and gain thorough implementation. Military dependents and the masses should be mobilized for production, and women should be mobilized to work to fundamentally solve the problem. When determining the acreage of substitute farming, adopting the method of "self-reporting and public discussion" is more likely to achieve fairness and reasonableness. In cities, the main approach should be to help them find employment and integrate them into various productions in conjunction with the recovery of the entire city's production. Regarding the implementation of preferential policies for the military, everyone believed that it should start with strengthening the overall leadership's attention to regular inspections and improving preferential treatment agencies. As for the issue of the connection between local governments and the military, the military pointed out that the written opinions and inquiries submitted to local governments in the past rarely received replies, making it impossible to explain to soldiers, which affected the progress of the troops' education work. Everyone felt that local governments should conduct in-depth self-criticism on this issue and strive to maintain more contact and communication with the military in the future. Regarding the issue of poor military dependents' children's enrollment, it was generally felt that at the primary school stage, this problem did not exist and could be solved mainly by organizing military dependents for production and ensuring their livelihoods. At the higher primary school stage and above, appropriate consideration should be given to poor military dependents' children within the existing quota of publicly funded students.
    In addition, issues such as military dependents' marriage problems and the relationship between the military and village cadres were also raised and discussed. The North China People's Government believes that these issues need to be carefully studied and resolved, and has distributed the above-discussed issues to relevant departments for prompt research and solutions.

    华北人民政府民政部
    召开优军工作会议
    讨论贫苦烈军工属生活等问题
    【本报讯】华北人民政府民政部于七月二十八日召开优军工作会议。参加者有华北军区政治部、供给部，二十兵团政治部，中共中央华北局组织部，各行署、省、市负责人等。会议由华北人民政府副主席兼民政部长蓝公武主持。会议着重提出与讨论了贫苦烈、军、工属生活问题的解决，以及贫苦烈、军属子弟入学、优军政策之贯彻、地方与军队的联系等问题。关于贫苦烈、军、工属生活问题的解决，一致认为：在农村，优军工作主要是代耕问题。目前由于勤务减少，今后更应该搞好代耕，且代耕必须作为整个大生产工作的一部分，始能加强领导，获得深入贯彻，并应发动军属与群众生产，动员妇女劳动，才能从基本上解决问题。在确定代耕亩数时，采取“自报公议”的方式，比较能做到公平合理。在城市，主要应靠帮助其介绍职业，结合整个城市生产之恢复，使之参加各种生产。关于优军政策之贯彻，大家认为应从加强整个领导上的注意到经常检查和健全优抚机构着手。至于地方与军队的联系问题，军队提出过去向地方上提出的书面意见和询问函件，很少见到答复，致使无法向战士作解释，影响部队教育工作的进行。大家觉得各地政府对此应作深刻检讨，今后要做到与军队多联系，多通信。关于贫苦军属子弟入学问题，普遍感觉初小阶段，此一问题不存在，主要以组织军属生产，保证其生活问题便可解决。高小以上阶段，应在现有公费生名额中适当予贫苦军属子弟以照顾。
    此外，还提出与讨论了军属婚姻问题、军队与村干间关系等问题。这些问题，华北人民政府认为均需认真研究解决，并已将上面讨论的问题，印发各有关部门，迅速研究解决办法。
