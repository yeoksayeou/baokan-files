【Ping City News】Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Liu Ningyi, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, Xiao Ming, labor heroes Zhao Zhankui, Li Fenglian, and others, recently issued statements on the White Paper published by the U.S. State Department. Excerpts are as follows:

　　Zhu Xuefan
　　The dream of U.S. imperialism using "democratic individualism" will also be completely shattered.
    Zhu Xuefan said: American imperialism once had a dream: hoping to achieve the goal of enslaving the Chinese people through "reactionaries who are no different from past warlords" and the Kuomintang reactionaries who have "lost the support of the people." This dream was shattered. Now, American imperialism is starting a second dream, which is to use so-called "democratic individualists" to allow the aggressive forces of American imperialism to be revived in China. However, the Chinese people have long seen clearly that it is impossible to blur the vision of the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have become unprecedentedly strong. We can assert that this dream will be completely shattered just like their first dream.
    In the White Paper, American imperialism revealed that it will continue its acts of aggression against the people's democratic China in the future, carrying out sabotage from "inside" and "outside." At present, blockading Chinese seaports in an attempt to hinder the restoration and development of the people's democratic China is one of these moves. We, the Chinese working class, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are able to overcome all difficulties. We will fight back against American imperialism ruthlessly by streamlining and saving, developing production, and intensifying the anti-blockade struggle. We know that we cannot yield to imperialists in the slightest. Only by completely defeating them can we stop their attacks.

　　Asian and Australian working class unite to oppose imperialist aggression
　　Liu Ningyi
    Liu Ningyi said: The U.S. State Department's publication of the White Paper exposes the shameful failure of the U.S. imperialist plot to invade China. It also attempts to create disturbances from the outside through blockades and from the inside by deploying a fifth column within our country. The Chinese people have consolidated and strengthened their unity under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, and after a long period of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles, have become an invincible and powerful force. Abroad, the people of Asia and the world are more united, and all imperialist plots will be crushed by the people. The upcoming conference of trade union representatives from Asia and Australia is a further manifestation of the spirit of internationalism. At this conference, not only will experiences and lessons be exchanged, but also the steps for workers in Asia and Australia to oppose imperialist aggression and oppression will be determined, so as to protect the democratic peace of the world and Asia and Australia with the united power of the working class and people of Asia, Australia, and the world. At the same time, we must work hard, raise our vigilance, and smash all the enemy's conspiracies and tricks.

　　Xiao Ming said:
    The great strength of the Chinese people can overcome any new difficulties
    Xiao Ming said: The White Paper is a historical record of American imperialism's invasion of China. Here, the U.S. imperialists admit their disastrous defeat in the face of the great Chinese people. This is caused by the great strength of our Chinese people and the solid unity of the great Soviet Union and the broad masses of people in various countries. Since we have overcome the difficulties of the past, we will certainly be able to overcome any new difficulties placed before us.

    Zhao Zhankui said:
    Fight to the end and defeat the US imperialism
    Zhao Zhankui said: The White Paper recently published by American imperialism is full of lies. We, the Chinese working class, can see it very clearly. No matter what White Paper or Black Paper it is, we must fight imperialism to the end. We must unite with the working class of the world to defeat it. We, the Chinese working class, together with the people of the whole country, must intensify the construction of our country and turn an agricultural country into an industrial country.

    Li Fenglian said:
    Do a good job in production and construction to consolidate our victory
    Li Fenglian said: The White Paper recently published by American imperialism exposed its crimes of aggression. However, we know that American imperialism will never give up its aggressive behavior on its own. They must dream of making a comeback. Therefore, we, the working class, must raise our vigilance. If imperialism is not destroyed for one day, we will not stop fighting it for one day. The Chinese working class must firmly embrace the lofty vision of enduring hardship first and enjoying happiness later, grit our teeth, make an effort, overcome all difficulties, and do a good job in production and construction to consolidate our victory. Moreover, combining the great strength of the Soviet Union and the world's working class, we will work together to completely eliminate these imperialists and their running dogs.

### 朱学范刘宁一萧明等　痛斥美帝白皮书

  　痛斥美帝白皮书
    【平市讯】中华全国总工会副主席朱学范、刘宁一，北平市总工会筹委会主任萧明，劳动英雄赵占魁、李凤连等，顷对美国务院发表白皮书发表谈话，兹摘要如下：
　　朱学范
　　美帝利用“民主个人主义”的梦也将要完全破灭
    朱学范说：美国帝国主义曾经作过一个梦：希望通过“与过去军阀并无区别的反动分子”和“已经失去人民支持”的国民党反动派，达到奴役中国人民的目的，这个梦是破灭了。现在，美国帝国主义又做起第二个梦来，就是要利用所谓“民主个人主义”者，使美国帝国主义的侵略势力，在中国得以死灰复燃，可是中国人民早就看清楚了，想要模糊中国人民的视听，那是不可能的。中国人民在中国共产党领导之下，已经空前强大起来，我们可以断言，这个梦也将和他第一个梦一样完全破灭。
    在白皮书里，美国帝国主义暴露了今后对人民民主的中国将继续它的侵略行为，从“内部”“外部”来实行破坏，在目前封锁中国海口，企图阻碍人民民主中国的恢复与发展，就是其中的一着。我们中国工人阶级，在中国共产党领导之下，是能够克服一切困难的。我们将以精简节约，发展生产，加紧反封锁的斗争，予美国帝国主义以无情的回击。对帝国主义者，我们知道，一点都不能退让，只有彻底的打垮它，才能停止它的进攻。
　　亚澳工人阶级团结反对帝国主义侵略
　　刘宁一
    刘宁一说：美国务院发表白皮书，供出了美国帝国主义侵略中国阴谋可耻的失败，它还企图一方面从外面用封锁捣乱，一方面在我国内部布置第五纵队来捣乱。中国人民已经巩固地坚强地团结在中国共产党毛主席领导之下，经过了长期的反帝反封建的斗争，已成为一个不可战胜的强大力量了。在国外，亚洲和全世界人民更加团结，一切帝国主义的阴谋会被人民所粉碎，即将召开的亚、澳两洲的职工代表会议，更是国际主义的精神进一步的表现，在这个会议上不但要交换经验教训，而且要确定亚洲、澳洲工人反对帝国主义侵略压迫的步骤，以亚洲、澳洲和全世界工人阶级与人民团结统一的力量，保卫世界和亚洲、澳洲的民主和平。同时我们要努力工作，提高警觉，粉碎所有敌人的阴谋诡计。
　　萧明说：
    中国人民的伟大力量能够战胜任何新困难
    萧明说：白皮书是美国帝国主义侵华的史实。在这里美帝供认了在中国伟大人民面前的惨败。这是我们中国人民的伟大力量和国际间伟大的苏联和各国广大人民的坚固团结力量所造成的，我们既然战胜了过去的困难，我们也必能战胜任何摆在面前的任何新的困难。
    赵占魁说：
    斗争到底打垮美帝
    赵占魁说：美国帝国主义最近发表的白皮书，满篇鬼话，我们中国工人阶级是看得明明白白的，不管它什么白皮书也好，黑皮书也好，对于帝国主义者，我们要和它斗争到底。我们要和全世界工人阶级联合起来，打垮它。我们中国工人阶级和全国人民一起，加紧建设自己的国家，把农业国变成工业国。
    李凤连说：
    把生产建设搞好来巩固我们的胜利
    李凤连说：美国帝国主义最近发表的白皮书，暴露了他的侵略罪行。但是，我们知道，美国帝国主义到死也不会自行放弃侵略行为的，他们一定要梦想卷土重来。因此，我们工人阶级必须要提高警觉，帝国主义一天不灭亡，我们就一天不停止和它斗争。中国工人阶级，一定要抱定吃苦在先，享福在后的远大眼光，咬紧牙关，努一把劲，克服一切困难，把生产建设搞好，来巩固我们的胜利。并且，结合苏联和全世界工人阶级的伟大力量，一起努力，彻底消灭这些帝国主义和它的走狗。
