Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th - TASS, The Hague: The Dutch Parliament debated the Indonesian question on the 16th. In his speech, de Groot, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Netherlands and a member of parliament, called the negotiations between the Netherlands and Hatta a vile farce orchestrated on Washington's orders. He strongly asserted that the negotiations were being conducted behind the backs of the Indonesian people, who were striving for freedom under the leadership of the democratic front. De Groot stated that the Indonesian people do not recognize the deal agreed upon between Hatta and the Dutch government under American guidance. Negotiations or agreements without the participation of the people are invalid. He demanded that the Indonesian people be given full freedom and that Dutch troops be withdrawn from Indonesia.

　　荷共总书记在议会演说
  　印尼人民决不承认
    荷帝哈达间的谈判
    【新华社北平十九日电】据塔斯社海牙讯：荷兰国会于十六日辩论印尼问题。议员荷共总书记德·格鲁特在其演讲中，将荷兰与哈达间的谈判，称之为奉华府之命扮演的下流丑剧。他力称：谈判系背着在民主阵线领导下争取自由的印尼人民而进行的。格鲁特称：印尼人民不承认在美国指导下的哈达与荷政府间商定的勾当。没有人民参加的谈判或协定是无效的。他要求给予印尼人民以充分的自由，自印尼撤退荷军。
