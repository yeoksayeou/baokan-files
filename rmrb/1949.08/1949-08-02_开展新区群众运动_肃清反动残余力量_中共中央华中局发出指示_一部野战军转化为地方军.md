Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, July 31st: The Central China Bureau of the CPC recently issued instructions to transform part of the field army into local troops in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi to carry out work in the newly liberated areas. Another part will be transferred to strengthen the suppression of bandits and maintain public order in Henan and Hubei provinces. The instructions require that the troops transformed into local units and those participating in bandit suppression and public order work should immediately begin or prepare to transform into work teams, executing the new task of doing local work in a decentralized manner. The instructions stated: "Today, when the enemy's main force has been eliminated and the foundation of work in the vast newly liberated areas is weak, a certain number of local armed forces are necessary to protect local governments, develop mass movements, and purge reactionary remnants, in order to remove obstacles to the advance of the main force. Therefore, converting a part of the main force into local troops is to meet the needs of the new struggle situation." The instructions put forward the following requirements for the troops undertaking local army tasks:

One, it is necessary to publicly conduct ideological education on the localization of the main force, so that the entire army knows that today the localization of the main force is as important as the past elevation of local armed forces to the main force; knowing that dispersing as a local army, suppressing bandits in the rear, and protecting local work are as glorious as eliminating the enemy at the front; so that the entire army can settle down to serve as a local army and do a good job in local work, in order to eliminate the incorrect concept of only wanting to be the main force and not wanting to be a local army, only wanting to be concentrated and not wanting to be dispersed.

Two, the troops that have been transferred to the command of various military regions should fully accept the leadership and command of the provincial and regional party committees and the military regions and sub-regions, and the provincial and regional party committees and the military regions and sub-regions should make specific arrangements and allocations according to the needs of the situation. Cadres of various units must fully obey the leadership of the local authorities, oppose the tendency to act independently, and oppose anarchism and undisciplined phenomena; at the same time, the original army or corps should never interfere again.

Three, the tasks of the local army and the main force are different, and education, management, and command of decentralized operations should be strengthened. After the main force is transformed into a local army, the good combat style, living habits, and work systems of the main force, etc., if they still meet the requirements of the local army, should be preserved, and should not be discarded casually under the pretext of localization.

    开展新区群众运动
    肃清反动残余力量
    中共中央华中局发出指示
    一部野战军转化为地方军
    【新华社汉口三十一日电】中共中央华中局日前发出指示，将野战军的一部转化为湘鄂赣地方部队，开展新区工作，另抽调一部加强豫鄂两省的剿匪和治安工作。指示中要求转化为地方部队及参加剿匪治安的部队应立即开始或准备转化为工作队，执行分散做地方工作的新任务。该指示称：在今日敌人的主力已被消灭，新解放的广大地区工作基础薄弱的情况之下，必须有一定数量的地方武装，才能保护地方政权，发展群众运动，肃清反动残余，以扫除主力前进的阻碍。因此把一部分主力改为地方部队，是为了适合新的斗争情况的需要。指示中向担负地方军任务的部队提出：
    一、必须公开进行主力地方化的思想教育，使全军知道今天主力地方化与过去的地方武装上升为主力是一样的重要；知道分散为地方军，在后方剿匪，保护地方工作，与前方消灭敌人是一样的光荣；使全军安心担任地方军，把地方工作搞好，以消除只愿当主力不愿当地方军、只愿集中不愿分散的不正确观念。
    二、已拨归各军区建制指挥的部队，应完全接受各省委、地委和军区、军分区的领导和指挥，由各省委、地委和军区、军分区根据情况的需要，加以具体布置和配备。各部队干部必须完全服从地方的领导，反对闹独立性，反对无政府无纪律现象；同时，原来的军或兵团绝不应再加干涉。
    三、地方军和主力的任务不同，应加强分散作战的教育、管理和指挥。在主力转化为地方军后，主力部队中良好的战斗作风、生活习惯、工作制度等，如仍适合地方军要求的，则应保存，不能借口地方化而随便抛弃。
