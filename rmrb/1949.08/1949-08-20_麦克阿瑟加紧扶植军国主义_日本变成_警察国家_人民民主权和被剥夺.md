Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 19th: TASS, New York, August 17th: The Washington Post recently published an article by its Far East correspondent, Tillman, from Tokyo, discussing MacArthur's occupation plan, stating that Japan is currently under the rule of reactionaries who are attempting to create a situation in Japan similar to when the extreme right-wing controlled Japan in 1931.

Currently, the living conditions of the Japanese working people are deteriorating. The people's living standards continue to decline. Factory workers are barely half-fed, struggling to survive on an average monthly wage of 8,000 yen (no more than $23). The article points out that "the reactionary forces headed by Prime Minister Yoshida have seized complete control of the government." Within the Allied headquarters, now "we rarely hear about democracy, but increasingly hear about the need for a strong government." Clearly, the aim is to deprive the Japanese people of the democratic rights guaranteed to them by the Potsdam Declaration. While the government is laying off 250,000 government employees and tens of thousands of private enterprise employees, it is also taking measures to restore the status of those representatives of the Japanese financial and industrial conglomerates who were purged for participating in Japanese military adventures, including the heads of major Japanese conglomerates such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi.

The article continues: Although extreme nationalist secret societies are illegal, they continue to operate rampantly. Members of the notorious "Chrysanthemum Flag Society" are attempting to unify all imperialist nationalist groups in Japan. The vast majority of the Japanese people still cannot enjoy the democratic rights guaranteed by the Potsdam Declaration. Those who want to exercise their democratic rights risk being labeled "traitors" by the police. In short, Japan under MacArthur's control has once again become a "police state."

The reporter writes that four years after Japan's surrender, some Japanese people still believe in the idea of the Emperor as a god. Educational reform has been virtually abandoned. Thousands of foremen violate labor standards laws and illegally search for cheap labor in rural areas. According to a recent report from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the ministry has discovered 6,500 underage boys and girls being sold into industrial slavery or prostitution, and the right to strike has been virtually abolished.

### 麦克阿瑟加紧扶植军国主义  日本变成“警察国家”人民民主权和被剥夺

　　麦克阿瑟加紧扶植军国主义
    日本变成“警察国家”人民民主权和被剥夺
    【新华社北平十九日电】塔斯社纽约十七日讯：华盛顿邮报顷刊载该报远东记者狄尔曼发自东京的论麦克阿瑟的占领计划一文称：目前日本是在反动派统治之下，他们企图在日本造成与一九三一年极右分子控制日本时一样的局面。
    目前，日本劳动人民的生活情形正每况愈下。人民的生活水准继续不断的降低。工厂工人仅得半饱，他们以平均每月八千日元（不超过二十三美元）的工资来勉强维持生活。该文指出：“以吉田首相为首的反动派已攫得对政府的完全控制”。在盟军总部里，现在“我们很少听到关于民主的谈论，而愈来愈多地听到关于必须有一个强有力的政府的谈论”。很明显地，其目的乃在剥夺波茨坦声明对日本人民所保证的民主权利。政府一面裁减二十五万政府机关职工及数万私营企业职工，另一面却采取措施，使那些因参预日本军事冒险而被整肃的日本财政及工业大垄断资本家的代表人物，恢复地位，其中包括日本大垄断资本如三井，三菱等的首脑人物。
    该文继称：极端国家主义的秘密团体虽然是非法的，但仍在继续大肆活动。臭名远扬的“菊旗年会”分子正企图统一日本一切帝国主义的国家主义团体。绝大多数的日本人民仍不能享有波茨坦声明所保证的民主权利。想行使他们民主权利的人，就有被警察列入“叛国者”名单的危险。总之在麦克阿瑟管制下的日本，已经又一次变成“警察国家了。”
    该记者写道，日本投降四年后的今日，某些日本人仍信奉日皇为神的思想。教育改革实际上已被抛开。数以千计的工头违反劳工标准法，仍非法地在乡村搜寻廉价劳工。据厚生省最近报告，该省已发现有六千五百名未成年的男女儿童被售为工业奴隶或娼妓，罢工权利实际上已被废除。
