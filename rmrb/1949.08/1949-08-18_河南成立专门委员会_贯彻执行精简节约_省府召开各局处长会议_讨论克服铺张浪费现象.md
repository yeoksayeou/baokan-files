　　Henan Establishes Special Committee
  　To Implement Austerity
    Provincial Government Holds Meeting of Bureau and Division Chiefs
  　Discussing Overcoming Extravagance and Waste
    [Dispatch from this newspaper] Kaifeng News: The Henan Provincial Austerity Committee was established on the 10th of this month. Zhang Xi, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Niu Peicong, Vice Chairman of the Provincial Government, serve as the Director and Deputy Director of the committee, respectively. They will directly lead the province in specifically implementing the "Decision of the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on Launching the Austerity Movement."
    Furthermore, the Henan Provincial People's Government, in response to the call of the Central China Bureau for austerity, has been holding meetings of responsible comrades from various bureaus and divisions for several consecutive days starting from the 8th of this month. The meeting reviewed and found that there had been extravagance and waste in the work of the agencies in the past. The main reasons were a weak concept of war, considering Henan as the rear of Central China; some cadres developed hedonistic ideas after entering the city, resulting in large administrative expenses and an increase in the number of odd-job personnel. The meeting decided that these problems must be overcome vigorously. After the meeting, various departments and divisions began to study relevant documents and check for extravagance and waste in their respective units. For example, the Administrative Office found wasteful phenomena such as taking large trucks to see operas, consuming 900 packs of cigarettes in July, and consuming ten catties of tea. Various units are now discussing issues such as saving office expenses and streamlining staffing. Some units have already made plans. For example, the Administrative Office of the General Office of the Provincial Government has formulated preliminary methods for saving public miscellaneous expenses for the entire office. The methods include stopping the use of large trucks for opera outings, reducing the cost of evening parties and opera performances by half, eliminating cigarette and tea expenses, reducing the number of miscellaneous personnel by one-third, and saving electricity, among eleven items. It is estimated that if these methods are implemented, 5,368 catties of wheat can be saved each month, accounting for slightly less than 39 percent of the total past expenditures.
    Editor's Note: The Henan Provincial Government's review of extravagance and waste in government agencies should arouse the serious attention of all our agencies and organizations. It should be admitted that similar phenomena have existed to varying degrees in various localities. In order to implement the austerity movement, it is necessary to ideologically mobilize all cadres, conduct serious reviews, eliminate waste, formulate practical plans, and earnestly implement them.

　　河南成立专门委员会
  　贯彻执行精简节约
    省府召开各局处长会议
  　讨论克服铺张浪费现象
    【本报讯】开封消息：河南省精简节约委员会已于本月十日成立。中共河南省委书记张玺同志、省府副主席牛佩琮同志分任正副主任委员。直接领导全省具体贯彻“中共中央华中局关于开展精简节约运动的决定”。
    又，河南省人民政府响应华中局精简节约的号召，本月八日起连日召开各局、处负责同志会议。会议中检讨出过去机关工作有铺张浪费现象。主要原因是战争观念薄弱，认为河南是华中后方；部分干部进城后发展了享乐思想，致行政开支庞大，勤杂人员增多。会上决定这些毛病一定要大力克服。会后各厅、处开始学习有关文件，并检查本单位铺张浪费现象。如行政处检查出看戏坐大卡车，七月份纸烟消费九百包，茶叶消费十斤等浪费现象。各单位现正讨论节约办公费，精简编制等问题。有的单位已作出计划。如省府秘书厅行政处已订出全厅公杂费初步节省办法，该办法包括停开看戏大卡车，减少一半开晚会看戏费用，取消烟茶费用，干杂人员编制减去三分之一及节省用电等十一项。估计照此办法实行，每月可节省小麦五千三百六十八斤，占过去全部开支百分之三十九点弱。
    编者按：河南省政府关于机关铺张浪费的检讨，应引起我们一切机关团体的严重注意。应当承认，各地或多或少地都曾经存在着类似的现象。为了贯彻精简节约运动，必须从思想上动员全体干部，严肃检讨，杜绝浪费，订出切实的计划，认真去做。
