    Yugoslav Nationalists are Agents of Imperialism
    By Maurice Thorez, Secretary-General of the French Communist Party
    Translated by Ding Ming
    A year ago, in June of 1948, the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties passed a resolution condemning the activities of the leaders of the Yugoslav Communist Party.
    The Information Bureau fully agreed with the CPSU(B)'s criticism of the mistakes of Tito and his accomplices, who, in rejecting the criticisms of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries, deviated from the principles of Marxism-Leninism.
    The Information Bureau's resolution clearly pointed out that the Tito clique's bourgeois nationalist line could only "lead to Yugoslavia's degeneration into an ordinary bourgeois republic, to the loss of Yugoslavia's independence and the transformation of Yugoslavia into a colony of imperialist countries."
    That was a year ago. Today, the facts finally demonstrate the correctness of the Information Bureau's judgment. Tito has gone over to the imperialist camp. Only because he has to consider the feelings of the Yugoslav people, Tito is still talking about the so-called socialism he is pretending to be building in Yugoslavia.
    As evidenced by its political attitude and policy activities, the Tito group is serving the imperialists.
    Before the war, Yugoslavia was a country with large amounts of investment by imperialists. Because of this and due to military and strategic considerations, the imperialists spared no effort to put it back in their control.
    In 1939, on the eve of the war, foreign investment in Yugoslavia was huge. Of the 1,435.1 million dinars (Yugoslav currency – translator) invested in industry and mining, 737.5 million, or 51.39 percent, belonged to foreign capital.
    In the metal manufacturing industry, 77.55 percent was foreign capital, in the machinery manufacturing industry, 81.69 percent, and in the chemical industry, 78.48 percent.
    Foreign capital accounted for 55.5 percent of the total investment in the coal mining industry, 60.3 percent in the electrical industry, 76.1 percent in the sugar industry, and the production of salt base stone was completely controlled by foreign capital.
    The characteristic of the Yugoslav economy used to be: the country actually exported all raw material products, such as 85.2 percent of sulfide ore, 93.2 percent of salt base stone, 93.3 percent of zinc ore seedlings, 83.7 percent of antimony ore seedlings, 74.8 percent of copper ore seedlings, 96.3 percent of aluminum, and 82.7 percent of chrome ore seedlings.
    The strategic importance of these raw materials is self-evident. It is not surprising that the American and British imperialists are trying to restore these raw materials (which can only be done with the cooperation of the Yugoslav rulers).
    If Yugoslavia were ruled by honest people who were committed to the cause of peace, then, with the help of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, it would be able to play a major role in the anti-imperialist camp.
    However, the intentions of the Tito elements are completely different. They are taking increasingly hostile actions against the Soviet Union, trying to break with the anti-imperialist camp, so that Yugoslavia may be taken over by the imperialists.
    To assess the inside story of Tito's claim that "there is no need for Soviet help to build socialism," it is enough to look at the structure of the Yugoslav economy. The sole purpose of this claim is to conceal the fact that Yugoslavia has joined the imperialist camp.
    After the Information Bureau's resolution was published in June 1948, it was expected that Tito would more openly dedicate himself to the imperialist camp.
    As expected, from December 1948 to January 1949, Tito exported non-ferrous metals worth 3,676,000 US dollars to the United States, which is equal to the total amount of Yugoslavia's exports to the United States in 1947.
    In December 1948, Tito signed a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, and signed similar agreements with Switzerland, Belgium, Norway, Pakistan, France, and West Germany.
    The Tito government has also repaid pre-war Yugoslav debts to the United States, totaling US$38.5 million.
    All of this shows the Tito group's desire to establish friendly relations with Western monopoly capital. The American imperialists (who are extremely happy with their newly recruited recruits) are not lagging behind others in seeing this desire. Therefore, it is not surprising that the US State Department has changed its attitude towards the Belgrade government.
    As people know, in December 1947, Yugoslavia requested a loan of 50 million US dollars from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, but was rejected. Since then, the situation has changed. On May 4 this year, Acheson declared at a press conference that the American representative in this bank would support Yugoslavia's request.
    Tito and his gang know very well that their policy is contrary to the interests of the anti-imperialist camp and the interests of democracy and peace. That is why they are trying to justify their attitude by announcing that the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries also maintain trade relations with capitalist countries.
    However, the purpose of trade between socialist countries and people's democratic countries and capitalist countries is to strengthen the economic position of the anti-imperialist camp and achieve this result, and therefore is helpful to the cause of peace. On the other hand, Tito's trade with capitalist countries allows the imperialists to use Yugoslavia's products for war preparations. This can be clearly seen from the vast amount of strategic materials that Yugoslavia is exporting.
    However, it is very easy to understand that the Tito elements have deviated from the principles of proletarian internationalism because they oppose the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, the international working class, and the democratic movement. They have betrayed socialism and are pursuing a policy that leads to Yugoslavia's transformation into a bourgeois republic.
    It is impossible to move towards socialism without fighting on the side of the great socialist country—the Soviet Union. This is why Tito, Kardelj, Djilas, Ranković, Pijade and their ilk have come out against the Soviet Union. There is no doubt about the path they have chosen.
    Yugoslavia can only move towards socialism along the path of proletarian internationalism. Proletarian internationalism means unbreakable friendship with socialist countries, fraternal cooperation with people's democratic countries, and militant solidarity with anti-imperialist forces around the world.
    Tito has chosen another path, the path of bourgeois nationalism. In domestic policy, this path is leading him to the struggle against the working class and the police persecution against the Communist Party, which is carried out by the most vile reactionary methods.
    Therefore, it is easy to understand that since the "Congress" of the Yugoslav Communist Party (which was specially staged after the publication of the Information Bureau's resolution to ease the situation), the main political weapon of the Tito group has been the People's Front, in which rich peasants and capitalist elements are playing a decisive role.
    It is quite natural that Tito's policy has resulted in consolidating the position of the rich peasants. Just as Pétain's followers in France united around the same banner, it is also natural that the former followers of Nedić and Pavelić are uniting in large numbers around the Tito group under the banner of anti-communism.
    It is also no accident that the former Chetniks and Ustaše in France are helping Tito's servants to engage in espionage and special agent work among Yugoslav immigrants. Moreover, the Ministry of Interior of Moch is giving them various assistance. However, this has not stopped Yugoslav immigrants from condemning the Tito elements' criminal policies. As long as they know that Moch supports the Tito elements, it is enough to understand the core of the problem.
    The Tito group's bourgeois nationalism has led to the struggle against Yugoslav communism. It has led Yugoslavia to join the imperialist camp, and the main task of the imperialist camp is to oppose communism and the Soviet Union. This is the fact that the Tito elements wanted to conceal last year, when they announced that Yugoslavia could go to socialism without assistance.
    Therefore, Tito's bourgeois nationalism betrays both the interests of the international proletariat and the interests of the Yugoslav nation at the same time. The logical development of events forces Tito and his gang to expose themselves as hangmen of communists and provocateurs serving the imperialist elements.
    Communists suffer torment and murder in Ranković's prisons. This is how Tito and his gang carry out the anti-communist instructions of American imperialism; American imperialism has given their lackeys a demonstration by organizing the "trial" of the twelve leaders of the American Communist Party.
    All of this makes it possible to measure the extent to which Tito and his accomplices have degenerated in the year since the Information Bureau's resolution was published.
    In the course of these events, certain questions must arise.
    One thing is certain: the imperialist intelligence agencies have agents among the Yugoslav leaders. And people will immediately feel suspicious, is this something that has been going on for a long time?
    For example, we know how Churchill refused to transport weapons to the French Interior Army and guerrillas.
    However, on the other hand, we know that Churchill's attitude towards Tito was very different. Since this cunning old British reactionary never forgot the interests of the reactionaries for a minute, the question arises: what guarantee could Tito give him at that time? We have the right to assume that during the war, the intelligence agencies had agents among those closest to Tito. The open betrayal of the Tito group has been prepared for a long time. Now the situation is gradually becoming clearer, because the rulers of Yugoslavia are forced to take off their masks and show their true colors as stooges and agents of the imperialist elements.
    The working people and democrats all over the world scornfully spurn the adventurers and spies around Tito. However, we have the most cordial feelings for the Yugoslav people.
    These people who suffered mad retaliation under the rule of Karadjordjevic are now suffering the same cruel oppression. Their economic situation is deteriorating day by day, and they are gradually convinced that Yugoslavia has been sold into the clutches of Wall Street. But the Tito elements are trembling. In their luxurious palaces (in which they do what they do, just like the petty tyrants of ancient Persia), these big shots understand very well that the imperialist elements linked to their destiny cannot defeat the forces of peace.
    Our hearts turn to the heroic Yugoslav fighters who are imprisoned for the great cause of communism, and to the various ethnic groups of Yugoslavia, who have been so abominably betrayed by the Tito group. We know that the heroic people of Yugoslavia are still loyal to internationalism and the fraternal and intimate solidarity with the peoples of the Soviet Union and the working people all over the world.

    南斯拉夫的民族主义者是帝国主义的代理人
    法共中央书记杜克各著
    丁明译
    一年以前，在一九四八年的六月里，共产党和工人党情报局通过了谴责南斯拉夫共产党领袖们的活动的决议。
    情报局完全同意联共（布）对于铁托和他的同谋者的错误的批评，铁托他们在拒绝各国共产党和工人党的批评中，脱离了马列主义的原则。
    情报局的决议明白地指出：铁托集团的资产阶级民族主义路线只能“导致南斯拉夫退化为普通的资产阶级共和国，导致南斯拉夫独立的丧失和南斯拉夫转化为帝国主义各国的殖民地”。
    这是一年以前的事情。今天，事实最后地显示情报局判断的正确。铁托已经走到帝国主义阵营那一边。只是因为不得不考虑南斯拉夫人民的情绪，铁托还在谈论他冒充他正在南斯拉夫建立的所谓社会主义。
    正如它的政治态度和政策活动所证明的，铁托集团正在为帝国主义者服役。
    战前，南斯拉夫是帝国主义者拥有大量投资的国度。因为这一点和由于军事与战略打算，帝国主义不遗余力地再度把它置于他们的掌握之中。
    在一九三九年，战争的前夕，南斯拉夫的外国投资是很大的。在工业和矿业的一百四十三万五千一百万第纳尔（南国货币——译者）的投资中，有七十三万七千五百万或百分之五十一点三九是属于外国资本的。
    在五金制造工业中，有百分之七七点五五是外国资本，机器制造业中有百分之八一点六九，化学工业中有百分之七八点四八。
    煤矿工业的总投资中的百分之五五点五是外国资本，在电气工业中有百分之六○点三，在制糖工业中有百分之七六点一，而盐基石生产则完全由外国资本所控制。
    南斯拉夫经济的特点曾是：该国实际输出全部原料出产，例如百分之八五点二的硫化矿石、百分之九三点二的盐基石，百分之九三点三的锌矿苗，百分之八三点七的锑矿苗，百分之七四点八的铜矿苗，百分之九六点三的铝和百分之八二点七的铬矿苗。
    这些原料的战略重要性是无须辞费的。而美英帝国主义者正力图恢复这些原料（这只有在南斯拉夫统治者合作下才能做得到）也不足为奇。
    如果南斯拉夫是由竭力为和平事业服务的实诚的人们所统治，那么，在苏联和人民民主国家的帮助下，它是能够在反帝国主义阵营中起重大作用的。
    但是，铁托分子的意图却完全不是这样，他们对苏联采取日甚一日的敌对行动，力图与反帝国主义阵营破裂，这样，南斯拉夫便可能被帝国主义分子所接管。
    要估量铁托所谓“无须苏联帮助以建立社会主义”的说法的内幕，只要看看南斯拉夫经济的结构就够了，这种说法的唯一目的便是掩饰南斯拉夫已经参加帝国主义阵营的事实。
    在一九四八年六月情报局决议公布以后，就预料到铁托会更公开地委身于帝国主义阵营。
    果然不出所料，从一九四八年十二月到一九四九年一月，铁托向美输出非铁金属价值达三百六十七万六千美元，此数等于一九四七年南斯拉夫对美输出的总额。
    一九四八年十二月，铁托与英国签订贸易协定，并与瑞士、比利时、挪威、巴基斯坦、法国及西德签订类似协定。
    铁托政府并已偿还战前南斯拉夫对美债务，总计三千八百五十万美元。
    一切这些显示出铁托集团与西方垄断资本建立友好关系的愿望。美国帝国主义者（他们对于他们新招募来的新兵极为喜悦）在看出这种愿望中，并不落于他人之后。因此，美国国务院改变了对贝尔格莱德政府的态度，毫不足怪。
    正如人们所知道的，一九四七年十二月，南斯拉夫向国际复兴开发银行要求五千万美元的借款，但遭拒绝。自那时以来，情况变了。今年五月四日，艾奇逊在记者招待会上宣称：这个银行中的美国代表将支持南斯拉夫的要求。
    铁托和他的一帮人深知：他们的政策是违反反帝国主义阵营的利益和民主与和平的利益的。他们正力图用宣布说苏联和人民民主国家也与资本主义国家保持贸易关系来证明他们的态度正确，其原因即在于此。
    可是，社会主义国家和人民民主国家与资本主义国家的贸易的目的是加强反帝国主义阵营的经济地位，并获致这种结果，因而是对和平事业有帮助的。另一方面，铁托与资本主义国家的贸易则使帝国主义分子可以利用南斯拉夫的出产，来进行战争准备。这从南斯拉夫正在输出的战略物资的浩大数量中，可以明白地看出来。
    然而，由于反对苏联、人民民主国家、国际工人阶级和民主运动，铁托分子已经脱离了无产阶级国际主义的原则，这一点是十分容易理解的。他们已经背叛社会主义，而且正在奉行一种导致南斯拉夫转化为资产阶级共和国的政策。
    不站在社会主义的伟大国家——苏联一边作战，是不可能向社会主义迈进的。这就是铁托、卡尔德、德日拉斯、兰科维区、庇赞德和他们的同伙出而反对苏联的原因，对于他们已经选择了那一条道路，是没有丝毫可怀疑的了。
    南斯拉夫只有沿着无产阶级国际主义的道路，才能迈向社会主义。无产阶级国际主义，就是与社会主义国家牢不可破的友谊、与人民民主国家的兄弟般的合作和与全世界反帝国主义势力的战斗性的团结。
    铁托已经选取了另一条道路，资产阶级民族主义的道路。在国内政策上，这一道路正把他引向反对工人阶级的斗争和反对共产党的警察迫害行为，而这种行为又是用最恶劣的反动方法进行的。
    因此，人们便易于理解，南斯拉夫共产党“代表大会”（这是在情报局决议发表以后，特地扮演，以使事态缓和下去的）以来，铁托集团的主要政治武器已经是人民阵线，在人民阵线中，富农和资本主义分子正起着决定作用。
    铁托政策已经造成巩固富农地位的结果是十分自然的。正如贝当的追随者在法国团结在同样的旗帜周围一样，从前涅第区和巴维利区的追随者在反对共产主义的旗帜下，正在大批地团结在铁托集团的周围，也是自然的事情。
    在法国，从前的契特尼克和乌斯塔西正在帮助铁托的从仆在南斯拉夫移民中从事间谍和特务工作，也不是偶然的。而且，摩许的内政部正给他们以各种协助。可是，这并未停止南斯拉夫移民导于铁托分子的罪恶政策的谴责。他们只要知道摩许支持铁托分子，就足以了解问题的核心。
    铁托集团的资产阶级民族主义已经导致反对南斯拉夫共产主义的斗争。它已导致南斯拉夫参加帝国主义阵营，而帝国主义阵营的主要任务就是反对共产主义和苏联。这是铁托分子去年所要掩饰的事实，当时他们宣布说：南斯拉夫可以不要援助，而走向社会主义。
    因而，铁托的资产阶级民族主义同时出卖国际无产阶级利益和南斯拉夫民族利益。事件的逻辑发展迫使铁托和他的一帮人暴露自己是共产党员的绞刑吏，是服役于帝国主义分子的挑拨家。
    共产党员在兰科维区的监狱中遭受磨难和残杀。这就是铁托和他的一帮人执行美国帝国主义的反共指令的情况；美国帝国主义已经给他们的喽罗一个示范，他们组织了对美共十二位领袖的“审讯”。
    一切这些使得度量情报局决议发表后的一年中铁托及其同谋者已经堕落到什么地步成为可能。
    在这种事件的过程中，必定发生若干问题。
    有一件事情是确定不移的：帝国主义谍报机关在南斯拉夫领袖中有代理人。而且人们立刻会感觉怀疑，事情是不是久已如此。
    例如，我们知道邱吉尔如何拒绝运送武器给法国内地军和游击队。
    但是，另一方面，我们知道邱吉尔对铁托的态度却十分不同。由于这个老奸巨滑的英国反动分子从没有一分钟忘怀反动派的利益，问题就发生了：铁托那时能够给他什么保证？我们有权利假定：战时，谍报机关在与铁托最亲近的那些人中有代理人。铁托集团的公开叛变准备已久。现在情况逐渐益趋明显，因为南斯拉夫的统治者被迫揭开了假面具，而且显现了他们作为帝国主义分子走卒和代理人的真面目。
    全世界的劳动人民和民主分子轻蔑地唾弃铁托周围冒险家和谍报人员。不过我们对于南斯拉夫人民具有最亲切的情感。
    在卡拉乔治维赤统治下遭受疯狂报复行为的这些人们，现在遭受同样残酷的压迫。他们的经济情况一天天恶化，而且他们逐渐深信：南斯拉夫已被出卖到华尔街的魔掌中了。但是，铁托分子正栗栗危惧。在他的豪华的宫殿中（他们在这些宫殿中的所作所为，正象古代波斯的小暴君一样），这些大人先生们十分了解：与他们的命运连在一起的帝国主义分子战胜不了和平的力量。
    我们的心转念到因共产主义的伟大事业而被囚的南斯拉夫英勇战士，转念到南斯拉夫的各族人民，他们被铁托集团这样可恶地出卖了。我们知道：南斯拉夫英勇的人民是仍然忠实于国际主义和与苏联各族人民及全世界的劳动人民兄弟般的亲密团结的。
