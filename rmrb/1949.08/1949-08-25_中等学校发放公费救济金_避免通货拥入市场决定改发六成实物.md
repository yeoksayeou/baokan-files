　　Middle Schools Distribute Public Relief Funds
    To Avoid Currency Flooding the Market, Decision Made to Issue 60% in Goods
    [This City News] This city's public and private middle schools have begun distributing public funds and relief funds for students for the entire month of August. According to the Finance Bureau's opinion, to avoid currency flooding the market and affecting prices, it has been decided to change the method of distribution to 60% in goods (millet, sorghum) and 40% in cash (calculated at 177 yuan per catty), with the following distribution methods: 1. Students who should be entitled to public funds and relief funds during the summer vacation will receive them as usual, but this year's graduates will no longer receive them from August onwards (junior high school graduates entering the first year of senior high school in the same school are not subject to this restriction). 2. Provincial schools that have been transferred under new jurisdictions will no longer receive funds from August onwards. 3. Students returning to school and newly enrolled students who should be entitled to public funds and relief funds after the start of the school year should have the number of kilograms of rice they should receive calculated by each school at the end of the month, and a separate roster should be sent to the Municipal Education Bureau for verification and approval. After approval, the funds will be supplemented. 4. Students participating in summer study groups should still be noted in the "Remarks" column, and half a month's food expenses will be deducted by the Municipal Education Bureau. (Wang Ming)

　　中等学校发放公费救济金
    避免通货拥入市场决定改发六成实物
    【本市讯】本市公私立中等学校学生八月份全月公费及救济金已开始发放。根据财政局意见，为避免通货拥入市场影响物价，决定改发六成实物（小米、高粱米），四成现款（以每斤一百七十七元折价发给），其发给办法如下：一、暑期中应享受公费及救济金之学生照发，但本届毕业生自八月份起停发（初中毕业生升入原校高一者，不在此限）。二、省立各校已转移管辖者，自八月份起停发。三、开学后返校及新入学学生应享受公费及救济金者，由各校于月底核算应领米数，另造名册送市教育局转请核发，俟准拨后补发。四、参加暑期学习团学生，仍在备考栏内注明，由市教育局代扣半个月伙食费。　　（王明）
