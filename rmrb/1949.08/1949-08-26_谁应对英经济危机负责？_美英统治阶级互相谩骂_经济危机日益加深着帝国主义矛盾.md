Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th: “Who is responsible for the British economic crisis?” This is the topic of the recent noisy mutual recriminations between the ruling classes of the United States and Britain. This quarrel, which includes blame-shifting, insults, threats, etc., is a reflection of the growing contradictions between British and American imperialism, and is also a "prelude" to the financial conference to be held in Washington. On the official side of the two countries, according to an Associated Press report from Washington on the 20th, it is expected that Cripps and Bevin will argue at the Washington conference that Britain's economic crisis was caused by the economic recession in the United States. On the American side, it is expected that Snyder and Acheson will put forward the view that Britain is responsible for its difficulties. On the parliamentary side of the two countries, according to a United Press report, U.S. Republican Senator Kem said in a speech in the Senate on the 22nd, "demanding that the economic soothing syrup being fed to Britain be stopped." Kem said that when Bevin and Cripps arrive in Washington, I will say to them, "There will be no more dollars until you take steps to help yourselves...". On the British side, Labour MP Aubreyen said in a speech in London on the 23rd, "We would rather risk the danger of enlightened communism than be manipulated by uncultured, pot-bellied American financial tycoons." In the press, according to an Associated Press report: the pro-Labour British newspaper "Sunday Graphic" published a cartoon on the 21st depicting an untidy John Bull (a nickname for the British people) stretching out a tin cup to Uncle Sam (a nickname for the Americans) in front of a bar called "Socialist Salon". The newspaper said that this cartoon, which insulted the British people, was recently published in American newspapers, and it is typical of hundreds of other cartoons on the same topic. The newspaper's headline was: "We British are tired of American insults." The newspaper also listed other examples of American newspapers offending Britain in recent times. It quoted the Chicago Daily News as saying: "It's that beggar again": it also quoted the Wall Street Journal, which described Cripps as one of Hitler's descendants. "Sunday Graphic" retorted, "Those who slander us have no hesitation in telling outright lies. Britain is accustomed to hearing ungenerous ranting from the Continent (referring to the United States). This time, we seem to be about to be kicked downstairs by the Americans... Some Americans seem to think that Britain survives on American money. Well! Do Americans also admit that the United States has survived twice in this century on British lives?"

　　“谁应对英经济危机负责？”
  　美英统治阶级互相谩骂
    经济危机日益加深着帝国主义矛盾
    【新华社北平二十五日电】“谁应对英国的经济危机负责？”这是美英两国统治阶级最近喧嚷的互相攻讦的题目。这一包括卸责、谩骂、威胁等等的吵架，是英美帝国主义间矛盾增长的反映，同时也是即将在华盛顿举行的金融会议的“前哨战”。在两国官方方面，据美联社华盛顿二十日消息称，预料克利浦斯与贝文将在华盛顿会议上争辩说，英国的经济危机系由于美国的经济衰退所造成。在美国方面，预料斯奈德与艾奇逊将提出这样的观点，即英国应对其困难负责。在两国国会方面，据合众社消息称：美国共和党参议员肯姆于二十二日在参院演说时，“要求停止再以经济的安静糖浆喂养英国”。肯姆说，当贝文和克利浦斯到达华盛顿时，我将对他们说，“在你们采取措施以帮助你们自己以前，再也没有美元了……”。英国方面，工党国会议员奥勃利恩则于二十三日在伦敦演说称，“我们宁可冒开明的共产主义的危险，而不愿受无文化的大腹便便的美国金融大王摆布。”在报界，据美联社报道：亲工党的英国报纸“星期日画报”于二十一日刊载一幅漫画，描绘一个衣冠不整的约翰牛（英国人的诨号），在一所名为“社会主义沙龙”的酒吧间前，向山姆大叔（美国人的诨号）伸出了一个锡杯。该报说，这幅侮辱英国人的漫画，是最近刊于美国报纸上的，这是同样命题的其他数百幅漫画的典型。该报的标题是：“我们英国人已听厌了美国人的侮辱”。该报还列举了美国报刊在最近时期冒犯英国的其他事例。它引了芝加哥日报的话：“又是那个乞丐”：它又引了华尔街日报的话，该报把克利浦斯描写为希特勒的子孙之一。“星期日画报”对此反唇相讥说：“诽谤我们的人没有迟疑于干脆的说谎。英国听惯了来自大陆（指美国）的毫不吝啬的谰言。这一回，我们似乎非被美国人踢下楼去不可了。……有些美国人似乎以为英国靠美国金钱才活下来的。好吧！美国人是否也承认在这一世纪内美国曾两度靠英国人的生命才活下来的呢？”
