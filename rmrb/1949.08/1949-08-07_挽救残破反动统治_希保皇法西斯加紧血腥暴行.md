Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th – Athens dispatch: In order to salvage its crumbling reactionary rule, the Greek Royalist Fascist government is intensifying its bloody atrocities. According to a TASS report, in late June, a large number of patients were arrested from a tuberculosis hospital in the Athens district. The patients were dragged from their beds and transported in large trucks to the basement of the Special Police Department. Four were sentenced to death, and five to life imprisonment, including three women, and another five to four years in prison. At the same time, the Royalist Fascist military court in Airo recently sentenced thirty-six Greek democrats to death, including thirteen women.

The Athens government's heinous atrocities are a manifestation of the extreme fragility of the Royalist Fascist rule. U.S. Ambassador to Greece, Grady, stated in a speech to the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee: "Without U.S. aid, Greece's economy would have completely collapsed long ago, and Greece's attempt to resist communist rule would have been shattered." Grady's words not only reveal that the reactionary government in Athens has long lost the support of the people at home, but also amount to an admission of the shameless interference of U.S. imperialism in Greek internal affairs.

### 挽救残破反动统治  希保皇法西斯加紧血腥暴行

    挽救残破反动统治
    希保皇法西斯加紧血腥暴行
    【新华社北平六日电】雅典讯：希腊保皇法西斯政府为挽救其残破的反动统治，正加紧血腥暴行。据塔斯社报道，六月下旬雅典区结核病院有大批病人被捕，病人被从病床上拖起，用大卡车载送到特种警察厅的地下室。有四名被判死刑，五名无期徒刑，其中有三名为妇女，另五名徒刑四年。同时，在艾罗地方保皇法西斯军事法庭不久以前判处了三十六名希腊民主分子的死刑，其中有十三名妇女。
    雅典政府的这种穷凶极恶的暴行是保皇法西斯统治极度脆弱的表现。美驻希大使格拉第在美众院外委会演说称：“要是没有美援，希腊的经济早已完全崩溃，希腊抵抗共产主义统治的企图也早已破灭。”格拉第的话，不仅道出了雅典反动政府早已在国内失尽民心，而且也不啻供认了美帝国主义对希腊内政的无耻干涉。
