Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, August 29th: The Jiangxi and Hubei Provincial Committees of the Chinese Communist Party issued directives on current youth work on the 15th and 17th of this month respectively. Both directives pointed out that in order to prioritize work in the countryside, it is necessary to strive to get a large number of revolutionary intellectuals to go to the countryside to mobilize peasants to carry out the struggle against bandits and local tyrants. However, given the current shortage of young cadres, during the initial stage of mobilizing the masses, the focus of youth work should first be on the workers and intellectual masses in the cities, specifically in factories, schools, and cadre schools and intellectual training classes held in cities such as Wuhan, Shashi, and Yichang in Hubei, and Nanchang, Fuzhou, and Ganzhou in Jiangxi. This is to mobilize and train a large number of educated youth to go to the countryside and assist the CCP committees in cultivating young work cadres. The specific steps to mobilize and train educated youth are mainly to help transform their thinking, establish a worldview of serving the people, learn the Party's policies, and learn how to mobilize peasants and unite intellectuals in the countryside. At the same time, it is necessary to discover and cultivate activists during the learning process and in the various practical struggles they participate in later, and openly and boldly absorb them into the Communist Youth League in large numbers, establish and develop the Communist Youth League organization, and become the Party's assistant in leading the masses. The two provincial committees also pointed out that the Communist Youth League members in factories should earnestly implement the policy of taking into consideration both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital, and actively resume production.

　　中共江西、湖北省委发布青年工作指示
    争取革命知识分子下乡发动农民反土匪反恶霸
    【新华社汉口二十九日电】中共江西、湖北省委于本月十五、十七两日先后发出关于目前青年工作的指示。两个指示都指出：为了把工作重心首先放在乡村，必须争取大批的革命知识分子到乡村中去发动农民进行反土匪反恶霸斗争。但在目前青年干部缺乏的条件下，在初步发动群众期间，青年工作的重点，应当先放在城市的工人和知识分子群众中，具体讲就是放在湖北的武汉、沙市、宜昌、江西的南昌、抚州、赣州等城市的工厂、学校及该两省各地所举办的干部学校和知识分子训练班中，以便动员和训练大批知识青年到农村中去，和协助中共党委培养青年工作骨干。动员和训练知识青年的具体步骤，主要是帮助改造思想，确立为人民服务的人生观，学习党的政策，学会做发动农民和团结农村中知识分子的工作。同时要在学习中，在以后所参加的各种实际斗争中，发现和培养积极分子，公开地放手地大量地吸收为青年团员，建立和发展青年团组织，成为党领导群众的助手。两省委并指出在工厂中的青年团员，并应切实执行公私兼顾、劳资两利政策，积极恢复生产。
