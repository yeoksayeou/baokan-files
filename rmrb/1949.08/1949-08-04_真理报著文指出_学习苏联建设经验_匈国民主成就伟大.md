Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: Moscow dispatch: *Pravda* recently published an article describing the achievements of the working people of New Democratic Hungary in the process of national transformation. The article wrote: New Democratic Hungary is growing and becoming stronger, and is victoriously overcoming all the difficulties imposed on it by enemies at home and abroad. Last year was a turning point in the democratic development of Hungary. Last year, the main reactionary forces were crushed, and the division in the labor movement was eliminated. The nationalization of large and medium-sized industries has won the heartfelt support of the working people. At the beginning of this year, Hungary's industrial production was 27 percent higher than in 1938. Hungary has built factories for manufacturing machine tools and some industrial equipment, which were previously imported from the United States, Britain, and other Western countries. The development of new industrial sectors has changed Hungary's foreign trade accordingly. It now exports machine tools, ships, locomotives, trucks, electrical equipment, and food industry products. The import of finished products has been greatly reduced. The achievements of more than 300 collectively cultivated agricultural cooperatives have attracted the attention of working farmers. Despite the vicious incitement of the rich peasants against the cooperatives, the number of cooperative members increased by 17 percent and the cultivated area increased by 36 percent in March and April alone. The article detailed the draft five-year plan for the development of Hungary's national economy from 1950 to 1954. The plan stipulates concentrating efforts on developing heavy industry and the machine-building industry (which is the basis for further developing light industry, implementing agricultural mechanization, and reconstructing the transportation industry). The five-year plan also stipulates maximizing the development of previously backward areas. Two new heavy industrial centers will be established. Generally speaking, Hungarian industry will complete the progress achieved in the fifty years before World War II within five years. In 1954, agricultural output will be 27 percent higher than in 1938. The article pointed out that Hungary's democratic achievements have aroused the fury of the British and American imperialists. After the failure of the reactionaries united around Nagy, the Western imperialists placed all their hopes on his loyal pawn, Cardinal Mindszenty. However, as is well known, the attempt to hype the Mindszenty case has failed miserably. The Hungarian government does not allow the United States and Britain to interfere in the internal affairs of the independent and autonomous Hungarian People's Republic. The article concludes: Loyalty to the ideas of proletarian internationalism, inviolable friendship with the Soviet Union, and learning to apply the historically significant experience of Soviet socialist construction under Hungarian conditions constitute the foundation of Hungary's democratic achievements. The Hungarian people, led by the Hungarian Workers' Party, are moving forward with confidence to transform their country into a socialist country.

    真理报著文指出
    学习苏联建设经验
    匈国民主成就伟大
    【新华社北平三日电】莫斯科讯：真理报顷发表专文，描述新民主匈牙利的劳动人民在国家转化过程中所达到的成就。该文写道：新民主匈牙利正在成长与壮大，并且胜利地克服国内外敌人加于它的一切困难。去年是匈牙利民主发展的转折点。在去年，主要的反动力量被粉碎了，劳工运动中的分裂被消除了。大工业与中等工业的国有化，博得了劳动人民的衷心拥护。在今年年初，匈牙利工业生产便较一九三八年多了百分之二十七。匈牙利建筑了制造工作母机与某些工业设备的工厂，这些设备以前是由美、英与其他西方国家输入的。新的工业部门的发展，使得匈牙利的对外贸易随之改变。它现在输出了工作母机、轮船、机车、卡车、电气设备与食品工业产品等。制成品的输入已大大地减少了。三百余个共耕的农业合作社所获得的成就，吸引了劳动农民的注意。尽管有富农反对合作社的恶劣的煽动，仅仅三四月份，合作社社员就增加了百分之十七，耕地面积增加了百分之三十六。该文详述一九五○年到一九五四年的匈牙利国民经济发展五年计划草案。该计划规定集中力量发展重工业与机器制造业的发展（这是进一步发展轻工业的基础，实行农业机械化与重建运输业。五年计划也规定最大限度地发展前落后地区。两个新的重工业中心将被建立起来。一般说来，匈牙利工业在五年内将完成第二次世界大战以前五十年间所达到的进步。在一九五四年，农业产量将较一九三八年多百分之二十七。该文指出，匈牙利民主底成就引起了英美帝国主义者的暴怒。当团结在奈基周围的反动派失败之后，西方帝国主义者便寄一切希望于他的忠诚的走卒明曾蒂红衣主教身上。但是，如所周知，借明曾蒂案件来大肆宣传的企图，已可耻地失败了。匈牙利政府不容许美国和英国干涉独立自主的匈牙利人民共和国的内政。该文结语称：对无产阶级国际主义思想的忠诚，不可侵犯的对苏友谊，学习在匈牙利的条件下运用苏联建设社会主义的有历史意义的经验，这些构成了匈牙利民主成就的基础。以匈牙利工人党为首的匈牙利人民，满怀信心地向前迈进，要把他们的国家转化成为社会主义国家。
