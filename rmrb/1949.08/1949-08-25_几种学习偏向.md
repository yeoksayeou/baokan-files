　　Several Learning Biases
　　He Zai
　　In the process of everyone's learning, I have noticed several biases that hinder the progress of learning and work. Therefore, I would like to put them forward for everyone's reference when learning:
　　The first type of person (especially young people) fundamentally loves literature and art, and is even more interested in novels than anything else. Therefore, in their spare time from work, apart from reading and studying novels, they neglect other things, especially political learning. Thus, they squeeze out all their time to study novels.
　　The second type of person is very fond of studying Marxist-Leninist works, especially some young intellectuals who have just been liberated. They feel that "in the new society, if you don't understand Marxism-Leninism and don't know how to use the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint and method to look at problems, analyze problems, and handle problems, you will run into walls everywhere." Because of this, they seem to have forgotten everything else, running to the archives to borrow "Das Kapital" and "Selected Works of Lenin" to cram, regardless of whether they understand it or not, and without even taking notes, they finish reading in one go.
　　The third type of person is active in work and pays attention to political and cultural learning (limited to books), but completely ignores studying the People's Daily, which guides everyone on the direction to take and the central tasks to do, because "they are not interested in newspapers" and "studying newspapers cannot improve political culture, it is just a waste of time, and it is irrelevant to my work." Therefore, they believe that apart from learning from books to gain knowledge, other learning is insignificant.
　　The fourth type of person is very active, serious, and responsible in their work, burying themselves at their desks from morning to night without rest. Others are very respectful of this situation, but they pay no attention to learning at all. Comrades, in order to help them, give them advice: "Comrade ××, you still need to take the time to study." Their reply is: "You can also learn in your work. If the work is done well, everything is good, and my mind is at ease."
　　I think the learning of the above types of people is biased. We do not object to the first type of person liking to study literature and art and hoping to develop in this area, and we even hope that they will develop in this area and achieve something in the future. However, it is wrong to simply study literature and art and neglect learning in other aspects, especially in politics, because a people's writer who does not understand politics can never write works that truly belong to the people.
　　It is right and also very necessary for the second type of person to want to know some Marxist-Leninist theory in order to gain a Marxist-Leninist viewpoint and method to look at problems, analyze problems, and handle problems, and it is also very necessary to learn in this area. However, a rough and superficial learning method and a lofty attitude of learning will not only prevent them from being effective but also waste their time in vain. It is better to honestly read some basic Marxist-Leninist books first. While reading, they should not only study carefully and take notes but also study and discuss with others. This will be effective for their progress.
　　It is of course good that the third type of person is very active in their work and pays attention to improving their political culture. However, only learning politics and culture from books, thinking that books are the only magic weapon for improving politics and culture, and not paying attention to or not wanting to pay attention to newspapers, in other words, not paying attention to some major current events at home and abroad, and not paying attention to all our current policies, and mistakenly regarding newspapers as irrelevant to improving political culture and to their work, is also a bias. Studying newspapers not only helps to improve politics and culture but also provides knowledge in other areas. As for the significance of studying newspapers for work, it is even more important. If a revolutionary does not pay attention to the development and changes in international and domestic politics, military affairs, and other aspects, and does not understand our current policies, they will live in a muddle and will not know what the people should do now and what they should do.
　　Although the fourth type of person shows a highly active spirit in their work, completely abandoning learning will lead to falling into the quagmire of routineism and will make it impossible to do the work better. In order to improve themselves and improve their work, they must squeeze out a certain amount of time to learn culture, learn Marxism-Leninism, and learn the party's policies.

### 几种学习偏向

　　几种学习偏向
    何哉
    在我们大家进行学习当中，我发觉有几种偏向障碍着学习与工作的进步，因此想提出来供大家在学习时的参考：
    第一种人（特别是青年人），从根底就爱好文艺，而对小说的兴趣更胜于其它，因此在工作之暇，除去看小说研究小说之外，其它的东西特别是对政治的学习则置之脑后了，于是就挤出一切的时间来研究小说。
    第二种人，很喜欢学习马列主义的著作，尤其刚刚解放的一些青年知识分子，感到“在新社会里不懂得马列主义，不懂得用马列主义的观点、方法去看问题、分析问题、处理问题，到处会碰壁的”。由此，他好似把一切都忘记了，跑到资料室把“资本论”，“列宁选集”借来死啃，也不管弄得懂弄不懂，甚至连笔记也不写，一气看完。
    第三种人，工作积极，也挺注意到政治和文化（只限于书本上）的学习，但对指导大家在目前要走的方向，要做的中心工作的人民日报却根本不注意学习，因为“对报纸没有兴趣”，“学习报纸不能提高政治文化，只是白浪费时间，对我的工作也无关”。所以他认为除去在书本上学习能得到知识之外，其它的学习是无足轻重的了。
    第四种人，对工作非常积极认真负责，从早至晚埋首于案桌上，也不休息，别人看到这种情形也很敬佩，但对于学习就一点都不注意。同志们为了帮助他就给他提出意见：“××同志还是要抽工夫学习”。他的回答是：“在工作中也可以学习。工作做好了，一切都好，心也就放下了。”
    以上几种人的学习，我认为都是有偏差的。第一种人很喜欢学习文艺，希望在这方面发展，我们并不反对，而且还希望他在这方面发展，将来有所成就。但是，只单纯地去学习文艺，忽略对别方面特别是对政治方面的学习则是错误的，因为，一个人民的作家如果不懂得政治，绝不能写出真正属于人民的作品来的。
    第二种人，很愿意知道一些马列主义的理论，以资获得用马列主义的观点、方法看问题，分析问题，处理问题是对的，而且也很需要向这方面学习。然而粗枝大叶不求深解的学习方法，好高鹜远的学习态度，非但使自己不能有收效，反而白白浪费了时间，不如先老老实实地读一些马列主义的基本书籍，在读的当中，不但自己用心地钻研，做笔记，同时还要和别人研究讨论，这样对于自己的进步才有成效。
    第三种人，工作非常积极，对政治文化的提高也很注意当然很好，可是只从书本上去学习政治和文化，认为书本是提高政治和文化的唯一法宝，不注意或根本就不愿意注意报纸，换句话说对当前国内外的一些大事不注意，对当前我们的一切政策不注意，错误地把报纸看成对提高政治文化与对自己的工作无关，也是一个偏向。学习报纸不仅仅对政治和文化的提高有帮助，而且还可以从报纸上得到其它各方面的知识。至于学习报纸对工作的意义，那就更重要了。如果一个革命者不注意国际国内政治、军事、以及其他方面的发展变化，不懂得我们当前的各种政策，就会糊里糊涂的过日子，就不知道目前人民应做些什么事，自己应做些什么事。
    第四种人，虽则对工作表现了高度积极的精神，然而完全放弃了学习，就会陷于事务主义的泥坑，也无法把工作做得更好。为了提高自己，提高工作，必须在工作之余挤出一定的时间来学习文化，学习马列主义，学习党的政策。
