There is No "Third Road"
    Studying "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship"
    Shen Yu

    "Not only China, but the whole world is the same, either leaning to imperialism or leaning to socialism, without exception. Neutrality is a disguise, and the third road does not exist." - Chairman Mao: "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship"

    After the end of World War II, the right-wing social democratic parties in capitalist countries, waving the banner of the "third road," vigorously spread illusions of reformism, deceived the working people, and attempted to weaken the class struggle. The British Labour Party and the French Socialist Party in Western Europe are typical standard-bearers of the "third road." However, their policies over the past four years have torn through their disguise, fully exposing them as agents of the monopoly capitalist groups and accomplices of imperialism.

  Disguised Socialists

    In its political program, the British Labour Party, on the one hand, acknowledges the corruption of the capitalist system; on the other hand, it opposes revolution and advocates the use of gradual reforms to "build a socialist society within the scope of capitalism." This is the "third road" that the Labour Party "socialists" brag about.

    Let's look at the actual situation. What is the "industrial nationalization" policy implemented by the Labour Party? For example, the Bank of England in Britain was "nationalized," but the Labour government still paid the old shareholders an annual interest of 1.2%; 107 steel industries in Britain were "nationalized," but the Labour government gave the factory owners bonds worth 300 million pounds (the actual value of the factories was only over 190 million pounds) and paid interest on time. The way these "nationalized" factories are operated still follows the steps of modern capitalist development, and the ruling position of domestic monopoly capitalists has not been affected in the slightest. This kind of "nationalization policy" is fundamentally different from the industrial nationalization of people's democratic countries. The nationalization of factories in people's democratic countries means that they have already broken away from capitalism and are moving towards socialism, and the capitalist system has been completely eliminated there.

    The British Labour Party, wearing the cloak of "socialists," is implementing a hypocritical "industrial nationalization" policy, the purpose and essence of which is to consolidate the capitalist system and save the bourgeoisie from the economic crisis it faces.

    As early as 1919, Lenin exposed the disguise of the British Labour Party. Lenin said: "The bourgeoisie needs these servants, they need to gain the trust of a part of the people, they need to be able to use some argument that the road of reformism is feasible to disguise the bourgeoisie and thereby deceive the people, and to embellish the advantages and possibilities of reformism very beautifully, so as to induce the people to leave the revolution." (Lenin's Complete Works, Vol. 24, p. 396)

  Disguised Democrats

    The standard-bearers of the "third road" often call themselves "democrats" in words. In fact, their actions are all anti-democratic and are executioners of the bourgeoisie. For example, in November 1947, during the great strike of three million workers in France to fight for higher wages, the government headed by the Socialist Party used violence to suppress it. They dispatched 80,000 troops and police to deal with the workers. Thousands of workers were killed and wounded by the shooting of soldiers and police. (See Gu Ning's "On Today's Right-Wing Social Democrats," p. 17, 1948, Moscow Foreign Language Publishing House.) Recently, during the British dockworkers' strike, the Labour government used "emergency powers" to frantically suppress it.

    These facts prove that the standard-bearers of the "third road" are no different from the Nazis. They are disguised democrats and agents of monopoly capitalists.

  Disguised Pacifists

    People who wave the banner of the "third road" often claim to be pacifists; in diplomacy, they are willing to be a "bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union," and are willing to promote the "independence" of colonies.

    For example, just after the end of World War II, the government headed by the French Socialist Party, on the one hand, signed a 30-year Franco-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with the Soviet Union, expressing to the working people that it could also conduct "friendly" diplomacy with the Soviet Union; on the other hand, it requested "economic assistance" from the United States, expressing to the bourgeoisie that it could obtain loans from the United States. It used this method to show the people that it was taking an "impartial" "middle road." The British Labour Party government is also like this.

    In fact, the road they have taken in the past four years has completely followed the anti-Soviet line of American imperialism. On the German question, they have helped the United States to destroy the Potsdam Agreement and split Germany at every foreign ministers' meeting. They participated in the "Marshall Plan," which is essentially an aggression, organized the "Western European Union," which is a military group, and signed the "North Atlantic Treaty," which is anti-Soviet in content. British Labour Party leader Cripps even made the absurd statement of "guns instead of butter."

    This series of facts not only proves that they are disguised pacifists, but also undoubtedly instigators of war and accomplices of American imperialists.

    On the policy towards colonies, the standard-bearers of the "third road" are still taking the imperialist line. For example, the British Labour Party government superficially allowed India and Burma to become "independent"; in reality, it still controls the reactionaries in India and Burma to suppress the people who are fighting for true independence and autonomy. French socialists created puppet regimes in Vietnam on the one hand and directly sent troops to massacre the Vietnamese people on the other. The actions of the "third road" executors in Britain and France to permanently enslave the colonies have not escaped the essence of the old imperialism in the slightest.

    × × ×

    In addition, there are many individual examples: The Tito clique, which betrayed Marxism-Leninism, can only move towards the imperialist camp; the Sukarno-Hatta clique, which betrayed the Indonesian people, can only surrender to imperialism.

    Today, any country or any political party between the peace and democracy camp and the imperialist camp is subject to a real test. The disguise of the "third road" cannot deceive the people of the world. They can only lean to one side, because there is no "third road" internationally!

    没有“第三条道路”
    学习“论人民民主专政”
    沈予
    “不但中国，全世界也一样，不是倒向帝国主义，就是倒向社会主义，绝无例外。中立是伪装的，第三条道路是没有的。”——毛主席：“论人民民主专政”
    第二次世界大战结束以后，资本主义国家的右翼社会党打着“第三条路线”的旗帜，极力散布改良主义的幻想，欺骗劳动人民，企图削弱阶级斗争。西欧的英国工党和法国社会党都是“第三条路线”典型的标榜者。但是，四年来他们的政策拆穿了自己的伪装，充分暴露了他们是垄断资本集团代理人和帝国主义帮凶的真面目。
  伪装的社会主义者
    英国工党在自己的政纲里，一方面承认资本主义制度的腐朽；另一方面却反对革命而主张以渐进的改良的办法，“在资本主义范围内来建设社会主义社会”。这就是工党“社会主义者”自吹自擂的“第三条道路”。
    我们来看看实际的情形，工党执行的“工业国有化”政策是什么？例如，英国的英格兰银行“国有”了，可是工党政府还逐年付给旧股东一分二厘的年息；英国的一○七家钢铁工业“国有”了，可是工党政府却给了厂主价值三亿镑（工厂实值只一亿九千多万镑）的债券，而按期付息。这些“国有化”以后的工厂经营的方式仍旧是遵循现代资本主义发展的步骤，同时国内垄断资本家的统治地位丝毫没受影响。这种“国有化政策”和人民民主国家的工业国有化，在基本上是不同的。人民民主国家的工厂收归国有，意味着已经脱出资本主义而走向社会主义的道路上去，而其中已经彻底消灭了资本主义体系。
    英国工党披着“社会主义者”的外衣，执行着虚伪的“工业国有化”政策，目的和本质却在巩固资本主义制度，挽救资产阶级面临的经济危机。
    早在一九一九年列宁便揭穿了英国工党的伪装，列宁说：“资产阶级需要这些奴仆，他们要取得一部分人的信任，要能用什么改良主义道路行得通的论调去装扮资产阶级并借此种论调去蒙蔽人民的耳目，把什么改良主义的妙处与可能性粉饰得很漂亮，这样来引诱人民离开革命。”（“列宁全集”第二十四卷第三九六页）
  伪装的民主主义者
    “第三条道路”的标榜者，在口头上常常称自己是“民主主义者”。事实上，他们的行迹都是反民主的，是资产阶级的刽子手。例如，一九四七年十一月，法国三百万工人争取提高工资的大罢工中，社会党为首的政府，便用暴力镇压，他们调来八万军队和警察对付工人。数千工人死伤在军警开枪射击之下。（见顾宁著“论现今右派社会民主党人”十七页，一九四八年莫斯科外国文书籍出版局。）最近，英国码头工人大罢工，工党政府便施用“紧急权力”疯狂镇压。
    这些事实证明了：“第三条道路”的标榜者和纳粹没有区别，是伪装的民主主义者，是垄断资本家的代理人。
  伪装的和平主义者
    打着“第三条道路”招牌的人，常常标榜自己是和平主义者；在外交上，愿做“美苏桥梁”，对殖民地愿促使其“独立”。
    例如，第二次世界大战刚结束，法国社会党为首的政府一方面和苏联订了三十年的法苏友好同盟条约，向劳动人民表示它也能和苏联进行“友好”外交，另一方面又向美国要求“经济援助”，向资产阶级表示它能获得美国的贷款。它利用这种手法，在人民面前炫示自己走的是“不偏不倚”的“中间路线”。英国工党政府也是如此。
    事实上，四年来它们走的道路完全是追随美帝国主义的反苏路线。在德国问题上，历次外长会议上它们都帮助美国破坏波茨坦协议，分裂德国。它们参加了以侵略为本质的“马歇尔计划”，组织了军事集团性质的“西欧联盟”，以及签订了以反苏为内容的“北大西洋公约”。英国工党领袖克利浦斯甚至还发表“以大炮代替牛油”的荒谬言论。
    这一连串的事实，不但证明了他们是伪装的和平主义者，而且无疑义地是战争的挑拨者，美帝国主义者的帮凶。
    在对殖民地的政策上，“第三条道路”的标榜者走的仍旧是帝国主义的路线。例如，英国工党政府表面上允许印度、缅甸“独立”了；实际上，仍然掌握着印缅国内的反动派镇压争取真正独立自主的人民。法国社会党人一方面在越南制造傀儡政权；另一方面直接出兵屠杀越南人民。英法的“第三条道路”执行家企图永远奴役殖民地的行径，丝毫没有脱出旧日帝国主义的本质。
    ×      ×              ×
    除此以外，个别的例子也很多：背叛马列主义的铁托集团只有走向帝国主义阵营；出卖印尼人民的苏卡诺哈泰集团，只有向帝国主义投降。
    在今天，任何国家、任何政党在和平民主阵营和帝国主义阵营之间，无不受到真实的考验。“第三条道路”的伪装骗不过世界人民，它们只有一面倒，因为国际上是没有“第三条道路”的！
