　　During this summer vacation, the Tongzhou District Youth Committee organized all the elementary school teachers remaining at school through the League members and elementary school teachers to hold the Summer Youth Academy and established the leading body, the Youth Academy Working Committee. According to the distance of each school address, three branch academies were established. The learning content includes three categories: culture, politics, and recreation, which are led and divided by the Working Committee in a unified manner. Culture and recreation are studied at the original school address respectively, while politics is studied by each branch academy concentrated in a certain school. The students of the academy are all Young Pioneers aged twelve to seventeen from various elementary schools.

　　Cultural learning mainly ensures the completion of summer homework. At first, the students thought that they didn't need to study during summer vacation, so they didn't bring their schoolbags to the academy. Later, it was decided to strengthen the inspection of homework, and the students raised difficult problems in their homework. Initially, the cultural class was a combined class, and there was no distinction between subjects. Because the level was uneven and the problems were disorganized, the students were not focused on listening. Then students of the same grade were combined together and difficult problems were explained by subject. Therefore, the students did not feel slack in their studies. As the teachers grasped tightly, adopted more praise and key criticism, the students' enthusiasm increased. Some completed their homework ahead of schedule and the teachers continued to tutor them with new lessons.

　　In terms of political learning, stories are used to inspire. Each week has a central week, namely Love the Country Week, Love the People Week, Love Labor Week, Love Learning Week. The lecturers bring vivid stories and tones to make the children listen attentively. The stories run through the four central ideas, so the gains are even greater. Children love their own stories the most, such as little heroes. The outline for group discussions should also not deviate from the story itself. For example, when discussing the story itself: When Lenin and the Tsar divided the family property, why did Lenin prefer those workers and peasants with black hands and black feet? As a result, the children's summaries were all very correct, knowing that labor created wealth. Avoid the answer-sheet method during discussions, as that would bind the children's thinking.

　　Recreation is carried out around the political central week. The small theater troupe and singing team have been revived after the dull examination period. There is also a weekend recreational evening every week, with each school preparing programs for joint performances.

　　The children live happily in their own paradise, experiencing the meaning of collective life, and better laying the foundation for life and study in the next semester, and cultivated cadres for the Young Pioneers and Children's League.

　　暑期少年学园
    李锁陀
    通州区青委会在这次暑期中通过团员小学教师将所有留校的小学教员组织起来，举办了暑期少年学园，建立了领导机构少年学园工作委员会。根据各学校校址的距离成立三个分学园，学习内容包括文化、政治、文娱三类，由工作委员会统一分工领导。文化、文娱分别在原校址学习，政治则由各分学园集中某校学习，学园的同学都是各小学中十二岁至十七岁的少年先锋队员。
    文化学习主要是保证完成暑期作业，同学们最初认为放暑假就不须学习，到学园书包也不带，后来决定加强检查作业，同学们就把作业中的困难问题提出，起初上文化课是复式班，也不分科目，这样因为程度不一，问题又零乱，同学们听讲的精神不集中，就把同年级的并在一起，分出科目讲解困难问题，于是同学们在学习不觉得松懈，随着教师们抓的紧，采取多表扬，重点批评，使同学们的情绪提高，有的提前完成了作业继续由教师补习新的功课。
    在政治学习方面利用故事来启发，每个星期有一个中心周即爱国家周，爱人民周，爱劳动周，爱学习周，讲课的人带着生动的故事和语调使孩子们听的出神，故事贯穿着四个中心思想，因此收获更要大一些。孩子们最喜欢的是他们自己的故事，象小英雄之类。小组讨论的大纲最好也不要离开故事的本身。例如讨论到故事的本身：列宁和沙皇分家的时候，为什么列宁偏要那些黑手黑脚的工人和农民，结果孩子们的总结都十分正确，知道劳动创造了财富。讨论时避免答卷式的方法，那样会束缚孩子们的思想。
    文娱是围绕着政治中心周进行活动，小剧团，歌咏队经过考试时期的沉闷又重新复活了，每周还有一个周末文娱晚会，由各校分别准备节目联合演出。
    孩子们愉快的生活在自己的乐园里，体验到集体生活的意义，更好的是给下学期打下了生活学习的基础。培养了少先队、儿童团的干部。
