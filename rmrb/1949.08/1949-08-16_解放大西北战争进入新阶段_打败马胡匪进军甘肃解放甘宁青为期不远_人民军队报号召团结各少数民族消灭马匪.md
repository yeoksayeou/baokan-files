　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 15th. The "People's Army Newspaper" of the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army recently published an editorial stating: The large-scale advance of the People's Liberation Army towards Gansu marks the beginning of a new stage in the Northwest People's Liberation War. The editorial stated: The Northwest People's Liberation War, from the time the bandit Hu Zongnan launched a large-scale invasion of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, has now lasted for two years and four months. Thanks to the correct guidance of Chairman Mao's strategic thinking, the arduous and heroic combat of all commanders and fighters of our army, the enthusiastic support of the people, and the close cooperation of the fraternal field armies, we finally defeated the Hu-Ma bandit armies that had ruled the Northwest for more than a decade, first defeating the public enemy of the Northwest people, the Hu Zongnan bandit army. In more than two years, the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army eliminated a total of more than 150,000 Hu bandit troops, completely liberating the Guanzhong area, and driving the remnant Hu Zongnan bandit troops into the deep mountains of the Qinling Mountains. This provided the People's Liberation Army with full conditions for this advance into Gansu to eliminate Ma Bufang of Qinghai and Ma Hongkui of Ningxia, and to liberate the vast people of Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia.
　　Starting from the 24th of last month, the northern route of the People's Liberation Army advanced along the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway, and the southern route advanced along the Pingliang-Baoji Highway, crossing the Longshan Mountains and advancing courageously. They first shattered the first line of defense of the two Ma bandit armies from Pingliang to Guguan Town west of Longxian, eliminating the majority of Ma Bufang's 14th Cavalry Brigade and the cavalry regiment of the 248th Division, and capturing alive the deputy division commander Ma Zhengkui and other officers and soldiers, more than 700 people. Subsequently, the People's Liberation Army defeated the second line of defense of the Ma bandits from Guyuan to the Liupan Mountains, defeating the main force of Ma Hongkui's 11th Army and annihilating a total of four regiments of the 256th Division of the 128th bandit army. In the twelve days up to the 4th of this month, the People's Liberation Army liberated the important towns of Tianshui and Pingliang in eastern and southern Gansu, and successively recovered and liberated the counties of ＠xian, Longxian, Changwu in northwestern Shaanxi, and Guyuan, Jingchuan, Ningxian, Zhenyuan, Chongxin, Lingtai, Qingshui in eastern and southern Gansu, and Longde and Qin'an counties west of the Liupan Mountains.
　　Now, the two Ma bandit armies are fleeing in panic, each scurrying back to their old nests. More than ten days ago, the Kuomintang bandit gang was still clamoring that the Shaanxi-Longdong army corps would "recover Baoji," but now they are silent.
　　The editorial called on all commanders and fighters to overcome all difficulties, disregard all fatigue, and pursue and annihilate the enemy more bravely, chasing them to Lanzhou, Xining, and Ningxia, resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and decisively eliminating the enemy, and avenging the suffering people and the martyred comrades. The editorial demanded that all units must strictly and conscientiously implement the Party's various policies and policies towards ethnic minorities, unite all ethnic minorities, and fight together to eliminate the reactionary armies of Ma Bufang and Ma Hongkui. All lower-ranking officers and soldiers of the two Ma bandit armies, once they surrender or lay down their weapons, should be treated leniently in accordance with the policy towards prisoners of war, their class consciousness should be raised, and all the rumors, deceptions, and tricks of the Ma bandits should be shattered.

　　解放大西北战争进入新阶段
  　打败马胡匪进军甘肃解放甘宁青为期不远
    人民军队报号召团结各少数民族消灭马匪
    【新华社西北前线十五日电】人民解放军第一野战军“人民军队报”顷发表社论称：解放军向甘肃的大举进军，是西北人民解放战争新阶段的开始。社论称：西北人民解放战争从胡匪宗南大举进犯陕甘宁边区算起，到现在已经过了两年零四个月时间。由于毛主席战略思想的正确指导，我军全体指战员艰苦英勇的作战，人民群众的热烈支援，以及各兄弟野战军的密切配合，终于以较小的兵力，打败了统治西北十数年的胡马匪军，首先是打败了西北人民公敌胡宗南匪军。二年多时间中，人民解放军第一野战军共计约消灭胡匪军十五万多人，全部解放了大关中，把残存的胡宗南匪部赶进了秦岭深山。这就使解放军获得了此次向甘肃进军，消灭青海马步芳、宁夏马鸿逵匪部，解放甘肃、青海、宁夏的广大人民的充分条件。
    从上月二十四日起，解放军北路沿西（安）兰（州）公路，南路沿平（凉）宝（鸡）公路进发，翻越陇山，奋勇挺进，首先粉碎了两马匪军从平凉至陇县以西固关镇间的第一道防御线，消灭了马步芳的骑十四旅和二四八师骑兵团的大部，活捉副师长马正奎等官兵七百多人。接着解放军又打垮了马匪从固原到六盘山间的第二道防御线，击溃马鸿逵主力的十一军，歼灭匪一二八军二五六师共四个团。到本月四日的十二天的时间内，解放军解放了陇东和陇南的重镇天水、平凉，并先后收复和解放了陕西西北部的＠县、陇县、长武，和陇东陇南的固原、泾川、宁县、镇原、崇信、灵台、清水和六盘山以西的隆德、秦安等县城。
    现在，两马匪军狼狈奔逃，各自窜向自己的老窠。十多天以前国民党匪帮还叫嚣什么陕陇两兵团要“收复宝鸡”，而现在却哑口无声了。
    社论号召全体指战员克服一切困难，不顾一切疲劳，更勇猛地追歼敌人，追到兰州、西宁、和宁夏去，坚决彻底全部干脆地消灭敌人，为苦难人民和死难同志报仇。社论要求各部必须严格认真地执行党的各项政策和少数民族政策，团结各少数民族，为消灭马步芳、马鸿逵的反动军队而共同战斗。凡两马匪军的下级官兵，一经投降或放下武器，即应按俘虏政策给以宽待，提高他们的阶级觉悟，粉碎马匪的一切造谣欺骗和诡计。
