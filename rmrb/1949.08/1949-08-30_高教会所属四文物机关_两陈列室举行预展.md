Four Cultural Relic Institutions Under the Higher Education Commission Hold Previews in Two Exhibition Rooms

　　[Ping Shi News] Yesterday (the 29th), two new exhibition rooms belonging to the Palace Museum, the Peiping Library, the Museum of History, and the Peiping Cultural Relics Arrangement Committee, all of which are under the Higher Education Commission of the North China People's Government, held previews. The Higher Education Commission specially invited dozens of experts to visit and hosted a tea party to solicit opinions widely. At the symposium, Zheng Zhenduo, Pei Wenzhong, Fan Wenlan, Wang Yechiu, and others spoke one after another, unanimously believing that today the people can hand over their beloved treasures to the People's Government for the people to study and appreciate, and this spirit of turning private collections into public property is worthy of our learning and commendation. Regarding the future development of museums, everyone believes that emphasis should be placed on the history of the people, not just focusing on the circle of emperors and nobles, to illustrate who is the master of history and the laws of social development. They also considered whether future museums, in addition to retaining a few of the largest comprehensive historical museums, should largely develop specialized museums to achieve the goal of changing tourist attractions into important tools for social education.

Note: The several thematic exhibition rooms recently arranged by the four cultural relic institutions under the North China Higher Education Commission are as follows: In addition to the "Revolutionary Historical Materials Exhibition Room" that has been opened, the Palace Museum has also started to arrange the "Imperial Life Exhibition Room," "Silk Fabrics Exhibition Room," "Jade Exhibition Room," and "Banned Books Exhibition Room." The Peiping Library has arranged the "Anti-Japanese War Historical Materials Exhibition Room," "American Imperialist Aggression Against China Historical Materials Exhibition Room," "Chinese Political System Information Exhibition Room," and "Zhao Cheng Tibetan Special Exhibition." The Museum of History has a "People's Donation of Cultural Relics Exhibition Room" and a "Newly Collected Cultural Relics Exhibition Room." The Peiping Cultural Relics Arrangement Committee has a "Historical Sites and Cultural Relics Building Regulations and Other Picture Exhibition Room."

　　高教会所属四文物机关
  　两陈列室举行预展
    【平市讯】华北人民政府高等教育委员会所属故宫博物院、北平图书馆、历史博物馆及北平文物整理委员会等四个文物机关，昨（二十九）日又有两个新的陈列室举行预展，高教会特邀请专家数十人参观，并设茶会招待，以广泛征求意见。座谈会上郑振铎、裴文中、范文澜、王冶秋等相继发言，一致认为今天人民能把心爱的珍藏交给人民政府以供人民研究欣赏，这种化私藏为公有的精神是值得我们学习与表扬的。关于将来博物馆的发展，大家认为应该着重在人民的历史方面，不要只注意在帝王贵族的圈子里，以说明谁是历史的主人翁，及社会发展的规律。并考虑将来的博物馆是否除了保留几个最大的综合性历史博物馆以外，则大量发展专门化的博物馆，以达到改变游览场所为社会教育重要工具的目的。
    按：华北高等教育委员会所属四个文物机关近来布置的几个专题陈列室如下：故宫博物院除已开辟的“革命史料陈列室”外，并着手布置了“帝后生活陈列室”、“丝织品陈列室”、“玉器陈列室”及“禁书陈列室”。北平图书馆布置了“抗日史料陈列室”、“美帝侵华史料陈列室”、“中国政体资料陈列室”及“赵城藏特展”。历史博物馆有“人民捐献文物陈列室”与“新收文物陈列室”。北平文物整理委员会有“历史古迹及文物建筑法式等图片陈列室”。
