　　Hongshun and Siwei Mines Labor-Capital Dispute
  　Official Signing of Mediation Agreement
  　Labor Bureau Gains Mediation Experience
    [This newspaper reported] The labor-capital dispute at the Hongshun and Siwei private coal mines in Mentougou has been preliminarily resolved through mediation by the Beiping Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau. Both labor and capital representatives signed the mediation agreement on the 27th.

    There are three private mechanized coal mines in Mentougou. Hongshun and Siwei mines are both owned by the capitalist Hu Xianzhou. When Mentougou was liberated, Hu fled into Beiping city. Encouraged by the victorious situation after liberation, the Hongshun workers voluntarily and gratuitously drained water for the mine for three days, and quickly increased production by 70%. At that time, the workers requested a wage increase. With the consent of Deputy Manager Li Naicheng, the wages of workers in both mines were increased by 30%. After Beiping City was liberated, Hu returned to Mentougou and claimed that he had lost more than 300,000 yuan since February 1st, demanding a wage reduction for workers. The workers wanted to investigate the reasons for the losses. As a result, they discovered false reports and accounts, reduced income, and increased costs: for example, calcium carbide was then priced at 3.5 to 4 jin of millet per jin, but the accounts showed 6 jin of millet per jin; on the income side, retail prices were calculated as wholesale prices. Therefore, the wage reduction was unsuccessful. Afterwards, Hu adopted a passive attitude towards production. Before liberation, he often personally went down the mine to direct the project (Hu himself is an engineer), but afterwards he stopped going down the mine. The previously set production plans (such as opening up the North and South stone gates, etc.) were no longer mentioned. He also deliberately made things difficult for the workers and did not take care of the tunnel equipment. On May 16th, two workers were suffocated due to a ventilation fan failure. The workers, in anger, slapped Hu in the face. Since then, Hu made excuses to go to the city for medical treatment and no longer went to the mine.

    On July 12th, the mine was flooded. Hu Xianzhou returned to Hongshun Mine and ordered the removal of all machinery and railways from the mine (according to common sense, during flooding, one should gradually retreat upwards, and the railway should not be dismantled), preparing to dismiss the active members of the trade union by stopping production. The workers' dissuasion was ineffective. On the 15th, the water receded. The workers requested to restart the water pump to resume work. Hu finally agreed, but pushed the responsibility away, saying: "Please take responsibility for your own actions. If there is merit, you will enjoy the honor, and if there is fault, you will bear the responsibility." Since then, he went back to the city. After July 22nd, Hongshun resumed coal production, but on the 30th, it was flooded again due to rain and power outage. Hu pushed the responsibility for the mine flooding onto the workers. The Hongshun and Siwei trade unions reported the above situation to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and applied to the Beiping Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau for mediation. The labor side demanded: 1. The capital side should actively develop production to ensure that workers do not lose their jobs. 2. The capital side should be responsible for production and should not deliberately make things difficult. 3. Request to sign a labor-capital contract. 4. Request compensation for the losses suffered by outside workers due to the capital side's unreasonable dismantling of the mine. 5. Restore old welfare benefits such as worker straw hats, soap, and tea. Regarding the capital side's request to reduce wages by 25%, they emphasized that the capital side's poor management was the reason and firmly refused to agree. The capital side stated that it could not continue to operate without a 25% wage reduction. On August 6th, the Labor Bureau sent personnel to the mining area to conduct on-site investigations and found that the capital side of the two mines often owed workers' wages for several months before liberation, and still used improper means to deal with workers after liberation, resulting in a serious confrontation between labor and capital and excessive left-leaning emotions among the workers. They patiently explained the policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital to develop production to both parties, prompting them to conduct sincere self-criticisms. They explained to the capital side that today's people's democratic country will never allow the capital side to continue to use the past methods of dividing worker unity and using delaying tactics to achieve its goal of ruling the workers. Today, it is necessary to rely on the workers to do a good job in production. The capital side should quickly correct any past mistakes in dealing with workers after liberation. However, the government still takes care of the capital side's legitimate business interests. On the worker side, they explained that today's national capitalists are friends of the working class, and it is necessary to ensure mutual benefit for labor and capital. Workers' lives should be guaranteed to prevent illegal exploitation by the capital side, but excessive demands that disregard the capital side's interests are also not agreed to by the government.

    Finally, the capital side admitted that it was wrong to deal with workers with old methods and only focus on wage reductions without starting from the development of production, and expressed its willingness to unite and rely on workers in the future to achieve mutual benefit for labor and capital by developing production. For the losses suffered by workers due to the dismantling of the mine, it is willing to compensate outside workers with living expenses of 6,000 jin of millet. The labor side also began to realize that some of the past excessive demands on the capital side and the act of hitting people were wrong. On August 17th, the labor and capital sides held a general meeting to make self-criticisms. Regarding the wage issue, the two parties agreed that the capital side's passive production was also one of the reasons for the losses before August 1st, so wages would still be paid according to the pre-liberation wages plus 30%. After August 1st, the workers accepted a 10% wage reduction (deducted from the increased total amount). The labor and capital sides went to the Labor Bureau on the 27th to sign the mediation agreement. According to them, in order to solve the long-term labor-capital relations of Hongshun and Siwei mines, they will continue to discuss how to sign a labor-capital contract in the future. The coal market is currently in the peak season, with broad sales channels and high prices. The capital side has set out a plan to actively pump water and resume production.

    Based on the Labor Bureau's experience in mediating the Hongshun and Siwei labor-capital dispute, when mediating disputes, one should not start by discussing specific issues of contention. One should first explain the policies, conduct persuasion and education to the labor and capital sides to clear their minds, and then make them conduct self-criticism on this ideological basis. The dispute issues will naturally be resolved easily. (Jia Chi)

　　宏顺四维两矿劳资纠纷
  　正式签立调解书
  　劳动局取得调解经验
    【本报讯】门头沟宏顺、四维两私营煤矿劳资纠纷经北平市人民政府劳动局调解，获得初步协议，劳资双方已于二十七日签立调解书。
    门头沟私营机采煤矿共有三家，其中宏顺、四维两矿均为资本家胡仙洲所有。门头沟解放时，胡避入北平城内，宏顺工友们在解放后的胜利形势鼓舞下，曾自动义务为矿方抽水三天，并迅速将产量提高了百分之七十。当时工人要求增资，经副经理李乃澄同意，将两矿工人工资提高了百分之三十。北平城解放后胡返回门头沟，声言自二月一日起已赔累三十余万元，要求工人减资；工人则表示要追究赔钱原因。结果在帐目中发现有虚报假帐，减低收入，抬高成本的事实：如电石一项当时为三斤半至四斤小米一斤，而帐上却写六斤小米一斤；在收入方面，有将零售价算作批发价等情形，因此减资没有成功。以后胡对生产即抱消极态度。其本人在解放前常亲自下窑指挥工程（胡本人为工程师），嗣后也不再不窑，以前所定的生产计划（如开辟南北石门等）亦不再提起。并故意刁难工人，对坑道设备不加照顾。五月十六日因通风机发生故障闷坏两位工友，工友们在气愤之下，动手打了胡的耳光，从此胡即托辞入城养病，不再往矿上去。
    七月十二日窑下进水，胡仙洲即回到宏顺矿命令拆去窑下所有机器铁道（按常理涨水时应逐步往上撤退，且铁道不拆），准备以停止生产来辞退工会中的积极分子。工人对其劝阻无效。十五日水退，工人要求重按水泵抽水复工，胡最后虽答应，但将责任推出说：“请诸位自己负责进行，有功劳亦归你们荣誉享受，有过亦是你们承担。”从此又进城去了。七月二十二日以后，宏顺恢复出煤，至三十日又因下雨停电，全矿淹没，胡即将淹窑责任推于工人身上。宏顺、四维工会方面将上述情况反映到市总工会，并向北平市人民政府劳动局申请调解。劳方要求：一、资方应积极发展生产，保障工人不失业。二、资方对生产要负责，不得故意刁难。三、要求订立劳资合同。四、要求补偿外工因资方无理拆窑所受损失。五、恢复旧有工人草帽、肥皂、茶叶等福利。对资方要求减资百分之二十五问题强调资方经营不善，坚不答应。资方则表示非减资百分之二十五不能继续经营。八月六日劳动局派员赴矿区实地调查，发现该两矿资方解放前时常拖欠工人工资达数月之久，解放后仍然以不正当手段来对付工人，因此造成劳资间的严重对立情形和工人中的过左情绪，逐向双方耐心讲解劳资两利发展生产的政策。使双方进行虚心的检讨。对资方说明今天人民民主的国家决不允许资方仍用以往的分化工人团结及以怠工的手段来达到其统治工人的目的。今天必须依靠工人去搞好生产。过去对付工人有错误之处解放后应迅速改过。但资方的合法经营利益政府还是照顾的。对工人方面则说明今天民族资本家是工人阶级的朋友，要保证劳资两利。工人的生活要加以保障，防止资方非法剥削，但过高的要求不管资方利益也是为政府所不同意的。
    最后资方承认以旧方法对付工人，单在减资上打算，不从发展生产出发的思想是错误的，表示今后愿团结与依靠工人，以发展生产来达到劳资两利。对其因拆窑而使工人遭受之损失，愿补偿外工生活费六千斤小米。劳方亦开始认识到过去对资方某些过高的要求与动手打人是错误的。八月十七日劳资双方开大会作了检讨。对工资问题，双方协议，八月一日以前的赔钱问题，资方消极生产亦为原因之一，故仍照解放前工资加百分之三十发给。八月一日以后工人接受减资百分之十（从增加后的总数中减）。劳资双方已于廿七日赴劳动局签立调解书。据他们表示：为了长期解决宏顺、四维两矿的劳资关系，今后将继续商讨如何订立劳资合同。现煤市正逢旺月，销路广，价钱高，资方已定出计划积极抽水，恢复生产中。
    根据此次劳动局调解宏顺、四维劳资纠纷的经验，调解纠纷时，不可一开始就谈具体的争执问题，应先解释政策，向劳资双方进行说服教育打通思想，然后在这思想基础上使双方作自我检讨，纠纷问题自然迎刃而解。  （家炽）
