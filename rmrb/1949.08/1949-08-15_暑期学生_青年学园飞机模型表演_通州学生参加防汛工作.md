Summer Vacation Students
	Youth Academy Airplane Model Performance
	Tongzhou Students Participate in Flood Control Work
	▲ Over 600 students from the Northwest District of the Youth Academy gathered at the Xiyuan Airport on the 13th (Saturday) to hold a grand sports meet. At that time, the People's Film Studio and the photography team of this district captured the most exciting scenes. After the sports meet, there was an airplane model performance. The students participated in the competition with great excitement. Immediately, the sky was full of airplanes circling, rising and falling. A catapult model plane from Pingmin Middle School won first place with nine seconds, and a glider from Chongde won the championship with seventeen seconds. While the students were having fun, the local People's Liberation Army sent a lot of boiled water, and the students shouted, "Thank you, People's Liberation Army!"
	▲ The Northeast District Youth League held a League Day in the Taimiao on the 13th, and welcomed the students who returned from the study group. More than 300 League members and students attended. At the beginning of the meeting, Comrade Shen Yi of the Northeast District delivered a speech. She called on everyone to study hard, and to go to the factories, to the countryside, and to all construction undertakings to build a new motherland. Comrade Helu of the Marxist-Leninist Academy also came to speak. He pointed out that only by integrating with the masses can the League be run well.

	▲ More than 300 students from the Tongzhou Summer Vacation Academy have been living an orderly life from the beginning. Although the study is very intensive, lively singing still resonates throughout the academy from time to time, and various evening parties are constantly held. In addition, several vivid half-day labor activities were also launched.
	▲ The Tongzhou Summer Vacation Academy launched anti-espionage propaganda, which enabled most of the citizens of Tongzhou to directly hear the propaganda and increased the interest of the students. Each propaganda unit was tightly surrounded by a large circle of people. The success of this propaganda was mainly due to the diversity of propaganda methods, that is, being prepared. We were divided into twelve teams, all with singing, living dramas, speeches, clapper talk, and yangko dances appropriately coordinated.
	▲ Students from the Tongzhou Summer Vacation Academy braved the scorching heat of midday, carrying hoes, shovels, baskets, and wooden sticks to participate in the flood control work on the Grand Canal. On the way back, they were drenched in heavy rain, and their clothes were all soaked, but everyone was still in high spirits.
	▲ Students from the Tongzhou Summer Vacation Academy comforted the local garrison and watched a circus with the garrison. They wrote letters of comfort to the People's Liberation Army in Jiangnan.

    暑期学生
    青年学园飞机模型表演
    通州学生参加防汛工作
    ▲青年学园西北区六百多同学，十三日（星期六）齐集西苑飞机场，举行盛大的运动会。当时有人民制片厂和本区的摄影大队把最精彩的场面摄入了镜头。运动会后是飞机模型表演，同学们都以无比高兴的情绪参加比赛，立刻高空满是飞机盘旋，高低起浮，平民中学弹射型机以九秒荣获第一，崇德滑翔机以十七秒荣获冠军。当同学们玩的正在起劲的时候，当地解放军送来许多开水，同学们高呼谢谢解放军。
    ▲东北区青年团于十三日在太庙举行团日，并欢迎从学习团回来的同学，到团员及同学三百余人。大会开始，首由东北区沈毅同志致词，她号召大家好好学习，并且要走到工厂里去，走到农村中去，走到一切建设事业中去，去建设新祖国。马列学院的赫鲁同志亦亲临讲话。他指出只有与群众打成一片，才能把团搞好。    
          （万金）
    ▲通州暑期学园的三百多同学从开始一直就过着有秩序的生活，尽管学习很紧张，活跃的歌唱还是不时响彻学园，而各种内容的晚会也不断举行。另外，还展开了几回生动的半日劳动。
    ▲通州暑期学园展开防特宣传，使得通州大部市民直接听到宣传，提高了同学们的兴趣。每一个宣传单位都被一大圈的人围得紧紧的。这次宣传的成功主要是宣传方式的多样性，也就是有准备。我们一共分十二队，都有歌唱、活报剧、讲演、快板和秧歌适当地配合着。
    ▲通州暑期学园同学们在酷热的晌午，扛着锄头、铁锨、筐子、木棒去参加运河的防汛工作。在回来的道上又淋着倾盆大雨，衣服没有不湿透的，可是大家依然情绪高涨。
    ▲通州暑期学园同学慰劳本地的驻军，和驻军一块看马戏。给江南的解放军写慰劳信。
