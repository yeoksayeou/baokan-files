Theoretical Study of Cadres on the Job in the Ji'zhong Ninth Sub-district

　　The theoretical study of cadres on the job in the Ji'zhong Ninth Sub-district (Note: Refers to the area before the provincial division) has yielded preliminary experience after four and a half months.

　　(1) The attitude towards learning must be honest.

　　Experience proves that no matter who it is, they must learn humbly like "primary school students," without arrogance, complacency, pretense, or concealment. "Knowing is knowing, not knowing is not knowing." Only with such an honest attitude can one learn well. All those with practical experience must recognize that if they cannot elevate themselves to theoretical understanding, they will commit empiricism. All those with some theoretical knowledge must recognize that their understanding of "theory" is only a "drop in the ocean" and very superficial. If they cannot connect it with reality and further delve into it thoroughly, they will commit dogmatism. All learners must be able to "learn from others' strengths to make up for their own weaknesses" and "use their own knowledge to help those who do not know." "Hypocrisy" and "pretending to know what one does not know" are the biggest enemies of learning. "Timidity," "loss of confidence," and "fear of speaking out" are also obstacles to learning. Only "humility," "frankness," and "courage" constitute an honest attitude. In the past few months, those who have learned with this attitude have gained a great deal. Conversely, the gains are minimal.

　　(2) The learning method should not be the same old way.

　　All unsuitable learning methods should be abandoned, and new and appropriate methods should be adopted and continuously improved to achieve the desired results. The following learning methods have been discovered in the past four months:

　　(1) Before studying each chapter, the study committee branch should designate a person (with a higher level of theoretical knowledge) to give a brief introductory report to everyone on the purpose and key points of studying the chapter, which issues can be connected with Chinese reality, and how to connect them. Necessary explanations of terms should be given. Then, individuals should read carefully and conduct organized discussions. This can quickly find the center and avoid detours.

　　(2) When reading individually, first look at the preface and table of contents of the book to clarify which chapter and section solves which problem. Generally, the whole book should be browsed first, and then carefully read and studied in depth. Learning should focus on the center and should not be too far-fetched. Problems that can be solved later should not be "forced" or "stubbornly" discussed in the front, so as to avoid wasting energy and time.

　　(3) Use your brain more when reading, think repeatedly, read and think, and then think and read again. Don't just read it over and over again, but pursue its meaning, not just memorize the articles. Only in this way can we digest and understand, learn something, and not forget everything after reading.

　　(4) When individuals encounter unfamiliar terms, words, or sentences while learning, they can connect them with the context to chew on their meaning, or mark them, set a time, consult a dictionary, or ask others for advice. Don't be stopped by this "stumbling block" and stop moving forward. In collective discussions, there is no need to dwell on terms. Just find someone or ask the study committee to answer them. Don't "bite and drill hard" on specialized academic issues that are too far from our reality, which is a waste of effort.

　　(5) People with a theoretical knowledge base should closely combine with people with practical experience, learn from each other, and help each other. People with theoretical knowledge should help people with experience to understand documents; people with practical experience can help people with theory to connect with practical problems. This is the only way to obtain relatively complete knowledge.

　　(6) Free combination learning between two or three people, and frequent casual talks, can clarify and solve many problems. A few people can agree to study the same paragraph, read it separately first, and then exchange their discovered problems and understood insights in a casual manner. Problems that cannot be solved in the conversation should be raised to the group, or organize more people to discuss them. In this way, a few people can chat when they have time, talk when they meet, say a little when they know it, and ask a little when they don't know it, creating a lively and casual atmosphere. Don't be too serious, don't talk a lot. Often many problems are solved through such casual chats. And it is easy to clarify the problems, laying a good foundation for the discussion meeting.

　　(7) Because we lack common sense in all subjects, we must often read newspapers when learning theory. The newspaper has extremely vivid and rich practical materials and various issues related to learning. Frequent reading can achieve the effect of "drawing inferences about other cases from one instance." Some comrades discard newspapers and do not read them when they study theory, which is obviously not good.

　　(8) Take notes. The scope of the notes can be wider, comprehensively recording the main points of a chapter; recording one's own insights; recording discovered problems; it is best to write through one's own brain, in one's own words, or excerpt important sentences from the original book. This can help one to organize thoughts, analyze problems, understand problems, and remember problems.

　　(3) Learning must be linked to practice.

　　Experience tells us that if we can connect to reality, we will be interested. If the connection is good, the learning mood will be high. If we realize that learning is useful, we will learn consciously and voluntarily. Only theory that can be connected to practice is useful. But how can we make a connection? Several months of experience have yielded the following points:

　　(1) When studying, pay attention to the time, place, and conditions of each issue, according to what it is proposed or occurs, why some things should be advocated, and some things should be opposed. For example, some things are feasible in the Soviet Union, but not in China at present. How to analyze and deal with it, and deeply understand it, is a prerequisite for combining theory with practice. If you cannot understand the document, it is difficult to connect with practice.

　　(2) Use comparative and analytical methods: compare which places are the same or different from China, and analyze the reasons for their similarities and differences. For example, what are the similarities and differences between the feudal society of Europe and China? For example, the development of capitalism has led to the bankruptcy of farmers. Will the development of private capital allowed in the new democratic society have the same result? If not, what is the reason? Such an in-depth comparison of the situation and analysis of the truth makes it easy to connect and also easy to clarify the problem.

　　(3) The leadership can point out practical issues that can be connected to according to a certain chapter of the book being studied, and let everyone chat and discuss. This is a way to open the door for everyone to connect with reality. The Yuanxing General Store once proposed to connect with reality several times, but there was no way to enter. After the leadership pointed this out, everyone quickly connected with reality, and the interest in learning greatly increased.

　　(4) Use theory to measure work and examine past understanding. After learning some theoretical knowledge, you can think back to the work you have done in the past and your understanding at that time, whether it is from many years ago, recently; your own, others'; successful, failed; higher-level, lower-level; all can be taken to measure and check. For example, rent reduction and interest reduction, land reform, and other work. In the past, many cadres only generally recognized that it was for "farmers to turn over," "solving the people's livelihood difficulties," and "opposing feudalism." After studying the history of social development, and thinking back, they realized that it was all to change the old relations of production, liberate the shackles of the productive forces, develop production, and build a happy society. Then, they realized that the idea that "everything will be fine after the land is divided" and "the revolution is completely successful after the landlords are eliminated" was not enough. This truly improved their theoretical level.

### 冀中九分区在职干部的理论学习

　　冀中九分区在职干部的理论学习
    冀中九分区（按：是划省份以前地区）在职干部理论学习，经过四个半月时间，已取得初步经验。
　　（一）学习态度，一定要老实。
    经验证明：无论任何人，都要象“小学生”般地虚心学习，不骄傲、不自满、不装、不瞒，“知之为知之，不知为不知”，这样的老实态度，才能学好。一切有实际经验的人，都须认清，如果自己不能提高到理论认识，就会犯经验主义；一切有点理论知识的人，都须认清，自己所懂的“理论”，还只是“沧海一粟”，而且空得很，如果不能联系实际，进一步钻研透澈，就会犯教条主义。一切学习的人，均必须能“学人之长，补己之短”，“以己之知，助人之不知”，“虚伪”、“强不知以为知”是学习的劲敌；“怯懦”“失掉自信”“不敢发言”同样是学习的障碍。只有“虚心”、“坦白”、“勇敢”才是老实态度。几月来凡能以此态度学习者，收获均大。反之，则所得极微。
　　（二）学习方法，不要老一套。
    对于一切不适合的学习方法，均应加以舍弃，采取新的适宜的方法，并不断加以改进，方能使学习收应有效果。四个月来所发现的学习方法如下：
    （１）每章学习以前，以学委分会为单位，指定专人（理论水平较高的），把学习本章的目的、要点、和那些问题可与中国实际相联系，怎样去联系，向大家作简要启发报告，对名词术语作必要讲解。然后再由个人精细阅读，有组织的进行讨论。这样可以很快找到中心，避免走弯路。
    （２）个人阅读时，要先把该书序言和目录看看，闹清哪章哪节是解决那个问题。一般应先把全书浏览一遍，而后再去精读钻研。学习要抓住中心，不要扯得太远，后面能以解决的问题，就不要在前面“死拉硬扯”的讨论，或“顶住牛角”的瞎争论，免得浪费精力，耗费时间。
    （３）读书时要多用脑子，反复思考，读读想想，想想再读读，不要只一遍一遍地去死读要追求它的意义，不要单死记条文。这样才能消化领会，学有所得，也才不至于看完忘完。
    （４）个人学习遇到不懂的名词术语话句时，可与上下文连贯起来咀嚼其含义，或者画记号，打时间，查辞典或请教旁人，千万不要被这个“拦路虎”挡住而停顿不前。集体讨论时，遇到名词术语也不必去扭住争论，找人或请学委会解答即行了。对离开我们现实太远的专门学术问题，也不可“硬啃死钻”，枉费气力。
    （５）有理论知识基础的人，应和有实际经验的人密切结合，相互学习，相互帮助。有理论知识的人应帮助有经验的人弄通文件；有实际经验的可帮助有理论的人联系实际问题。这样才会得到比较完全的知识。
    （６）两三个人自由结合学习，经常漫谈，可以明确与解决不少问题。几个人可约定学习同一段落，先各自阅读，读完即以漫谈方式，交换个人所发现问题和领会的心得。交谈中所不能解决的问题，提到小组，或组织更多的人来讨论。这样几个人有时间就扯，碰到面就谈，知道一点说一点，不知哪点问哪点，造成活泼漫谈的空气，不要太严肃，不要夸夸其谈地谈一大套。常常有很多问题经过这样漫谈闲扯就解决了。而且容易明确其中问题，为讨论会打好基础。
    （７）由于我们各科常识都很缺乏，在学理论时，必须经常读报，报上有极生动而丰富的各种实际材料和有关学习的各种问题。常常阅读可收“触类旁通”的效果。有些同志一学习理论就把报纸丢开不看，显然是不好的。
    （８）要写笔记。笔记的范围可以广泛些，综合记某章的要点；记自己的心得；记发现的问题；最好能透过自己脑子，用自己的话来写，或者摘录原书重要语句也可。这样可以帮助自己整理思想，分析问题，理解问题，记忆问题。
　　（三）学习要与实际相联系。
    经验告诉我们：能联系到实际，就会有兴趣，联系得好，学习情绪就高涨，体会到学了有用，就会自觉自愿的来学。也只有学到能与实际相联系的理论才是有用的。但是怎样才能发生联系呢？几个月的经验，有这么几点：
    （１）在学习时要注意每一问题的时间、地点、条件、是根据什么提出或发生的，为什么某些事要提倡，而某些事要反对，如有些事在苏联就可行，而在中国目前情况下就不可行；怎样分析、怎样处理，深入领会，这是使理论与实际结合的先决条件，不能弄通文件，就很难联系实际。
    （２）要用比较、分析的方法：比较哪些地方与中国相同或不同，分析其相同与不同的原因。譬如：欧洲的封建社会有哪些与中国相同和不同之点；又如：资本主义发展的结果造成了农民破产，那么，新民主主义社会允许私人资本发展，是否也会有同样结果呢？不会的话，原因何在？这样深入的比较情况，分析道理，就容易联系起来，也容易把问题弄清楚。
    （３）领导上可根据学习的某一章书，指出可以联系到的实际问题，让大家漫谈讨论，这是给大家联系实际开门的办法。元兴总店曾几次提出联系实际，但无门可入，经过领导上这样指出后，大家便很快地联系到实际，学习兴趣大大提高。
    （４）用理论来衡量工作，检查过去认识。当着学了一些理论知识后，即可反回来想想过去已作过的工作和当时的认识，不论是远年的，近来的；自己的，别人的；成功的，失败的；上级的，下级的；都可拿来衡量检查。譬如：减租减息、土地改革等工作。好些干部以往只笼统地认识是为了“农民翻身”“解决人民生活困难”“反对封建”。在学了社会发展史，反回一想，才认识到那都是为了改变旧的生产关系，解放生产力的束缚，发展生产，建设美满的社会；便认识到过去以为“分了地就万事大吉”“消灭了地主就革命完全成功”的想法是不够的。这就真正提高了自己的理论水平。
