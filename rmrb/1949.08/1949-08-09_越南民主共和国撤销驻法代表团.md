    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 8th. A communique issued by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in France, citing Agence France-Presse from Paris, stated that due to the French government's continued colonial conquest policy, the delegation "withdrew" from August 1, 1949, and ceased all activities in France. Only when the French government abandons its colonial conquest and war policies and recognizes Vietnam's independence can Vietnam resume normal relations with France.

    越南民主共和国撤销驻法代表团
    【新华社北平八日电】据法新社巴黎电引越南民主共和国驻法代表团发表的公报称：由于法政府继续其殖民地征服政策，代表团自一九四九年八月一日起“撤销”，停止一切在法活动。只有在法政府放弃殖民地征服和战争的政策并承认越南的独立时，越南才能与法国恢复正常关系。
