    [Our Newspaper] The North China University Graduates Summer Study Group held its graduation ceremony at the Tsinghua University Auditorium at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 8th). More than two thousand university graduates from all over North China listened with excitement and attachment to the parting words of encouragement from leaders and guests. First, Comrade Qian Junrui, on behalf of the North China Higher Education Committee, welcomed them to their posts serving the people. After describing the current situation where the Chinese revolution has achieved basic victory and is approaching national victory, he went on to explain that we must now vigorously practice streamlining and economizing, make necessary evacuations of the urban population, and greatly develop rural work. He called on the graduating students to stand on the position of the proletariat and the masses of the people, wholeheartedly serve the people, work hard to economize, and go to work in the countryside in large numbers to restore and develop rural production. Then Mr. Guo Moruo spoke, having come to attend this ceremony despite being ill. He gave the students a word: "Learn as long as you live." Comrade Feng Naichao, director of the Summer Study Group, bid farewell to everyone on behalf of the study group, calling on the students to fight for the construction of a new democratic New China. Subsequently, guests Mr. Lu Zhiwei and Mr. Wu Han, as well as students, spoke. The meeting adjourned at a little after 12:00 noon. (Pan Lan)
