    Collecting Learning Insights
    Bi-Weekly Wall Newspaper to be Published
    Decisions by the Labor Bureau, Land Administration Bureau, and Learning Committee Branches
    [Our Newspaper] The cadres at all levels of the Labor and Land Administration Bureaus have been carrying out theoretical, policy, or cultural learning in accordance with the arrangements of the Municipal Government Learning Committee. The Learning Committee branches of the two bureaus have decided to publish a bi-weekly wall newspaper to collect everyone's learning insights and work experience. After studying "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" last month, the two bureaus jointly held a test on the 1st of this month. The test papers are currently being democratically evaluated by the Learning Committee branches. The cultural and recreational committee jointly organized by the two bureaus, considering everyone's intensive learning and work, has encouraged everyone to strengthen recreational activities. Under the leadership of Deputy Director Ma of the Labor Bureau in leading the Yangko dance, everyone is having a great time after meals every day, and they all recognize that appropriate recreational activities do have a great supporting role in the work and learning of the organization.
    [Our Newspaper] Since the Eighth District launched the study of "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," for half a month, units such as the District Committee, District Office, Trade Union Office, and Public Security Bureau Branch have adhered to the two-hour learning system, holding an average of three discussion meetings per week. Originally scheduled to finish the study by August 1st, the learning time has been extended by one week for a thorough understanding.
    This study first involves careful reading, and then mutual aid learning groups composed of three or four comrades prepare and deliberate based on the study outline drafted by the District Committee, and raise questions beyond the outline to launch discussions. Finally, the groups jointly hold a discussion meeting. After the discussion, the responsible comrades answer questions that have caused controversy or are vaguely understood.
    For comrades with low cultural levels, the document is explained sentence by sentence and paragraph by paragraph so that they can not only understand the document but also thoroughly understand its content, and then they are led to start discussions. This approach helps them a lot. During the discussions, everyone argues very enthusiastically.
    In addition to relying on mutual aid learning groups to promote learning, the District Office and the Trade Union Office, at each discussion, the comrades presiding over the discussion designate some comrades to answer the questions that were discussed and concluded last time. In this way, on the one hand, every comrade can have a clear understanding of the issues after the discussion, and at the same time, it can correct the unconcerned attitude of individual comrades who do not speak during the discussion and do not concentrate on listening to the opinions of others.

    汇集学习心得
    出刊两周壁报
    劳动局地政局学委分会决定
    【本报讯】劳动、地政两局各级干部已经按照市府学委会的布置，分别进行理论的、政策的或文化的学习。该两局的分学委会并决定每两周汇集大家的学习心得与工作经验出刊壁报一次。上个月学习“论人民民主专政”以后，本月一日两个局联合举行了一次测验，试卷正由分学委会进行民主评定中。两局共同组织的文化娱乐委员会因为大家学习与工作十分紧张，特发动大家加强文娱活动，在劳动局马副局长领头扭秧歌的推动下，每天饭后的时间大家玩得非常热闹，并且全都认识到适当的文娱活动对机关工作和学习确实有很大配合作用。
    【本报讯】八区自展开学习“论人民民主专政”之后，半月以来，区委会、区公所、工会办事处、公安分局等单位都坚持了两小时学习制度，平均每周举行三次讨论会，本来预定八月一日学完，为了透澈了解，特将学习时间延长一个星期。
    这一次学习首先是精读，然后由三个或四个同志组成的互助学习小组根据区委会拟定的学习提纲加以准备和酝酿，并提出提纲以外的问题，展开讨论，最后各小组联合举行讨论会。讨论结束后，对于引起争论或认识模糊的问题，请负责同志解答。
    对于文化水平低的同志，先就文件逐句逐段的加以解释，使他们不但能够看通文件，而且能够透澈了解文件的内容，然后再领导他们展开讨论。这种方式对他们帮助很大。在讨论时，大家争论的很热烈。
    除了依靠学习互助小组推动学习之外，区公所、工会办事处在每次讨论时，由主持讨论的同志当场指定一些同志回答上次讨论过得到结论的问题，这样一方面可以使每一个同志对于讨论后的问题能够有一清楚的认识，同时还可以纠正个别同志在讨论时不发言，不集中精神听取别人意见的不虚心的态度。
