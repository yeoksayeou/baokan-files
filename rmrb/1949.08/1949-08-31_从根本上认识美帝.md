　　From Fundamentally Understanding American Imperialism
    Professor of Peking University Fan Hong
    The United States is the most developed country of monopoly capitalism. Undoubtedly, all U.S. foreign policy must aim to maintain and expand the reproduction of U.S. monopoly capital. Is it possible for the United States to maintain its monopoly capital without adopting a policy of capitalist aggression? Of course, this is impossible. According to the estimation of bourgeois economist Professor Douglas Copland, although American monopoly capitalism has created an unprecedented record in production, its sales channels are extremely narrow. He said in a lecture at Peking University in September 1947: "At this moment, the annual export of goods from the United States is about 20 billion U.S. dollars, but the import of goods is worth about 8 billion U.S. dollars. If foreign countries want to continue to buy goods from the United States, then this large gap of 12 billion U.S. dollars must be filled. If this gap cannot be filled by some form of U.S. dollar supply, then foreign countries will feel a lack of U.S. dollars to buy U.S. goods, and exports will inevitably decrease. If U.S. exports decrease by 1 billion U.S. dollars, assuming that domestic demand in the United States remains unchanged, then at least one million workers in the United States will be unemployed." (Originally published on page 2 of the Peiping English "China Daily News" on September 27, 1947) This passage clearly shows that if the U.S. government does not seize investment destinations abroad and continue to invest in foreign countries, so that foreign countries can use the U.S. dollars lent by the United States to buy U.S. exports, then the U.S.'s surplus materials of 12 billion U.S. dollars will not be sold, and at the same time, the United States will have more than ten million unemployed. This means that American monopoly capitalism will suddenly collapse. From this, it can be seen that the foreign policy of the U.S. government, no matter what beautiful sugar coating it wears, must aim at seizing investment markets.
    But can American imperialism seize China's investment market without interfering in China's internal affairs? This can be explained in two stages. Before the oppressed workers and peasants of China were awakened, if the United States came to China to seize investment markets, although it might encounter resistance from national capitalists, because the strength of China's national capitalists was not strong, the U.S. government only needed to use the existing feudal government as a tool to suppress the resistance of China's national capitalists and accept the unequal treaties imposed by the U.S. imperialism to facilitate the increase of U.S. exports to China or the increase of investment. Whether China is unified or not, the investment purpose of the U.S. imperialism can be achieved in the same way, and the U.S. imperialism naturally does not feel the need to openly interfere in China's internal affairs. Around the time of the Xinhai Revolution, the U.S. government was supporting the昏庸无知的（muddle-headed and ignorant） Qing government or the 北洋军阀（Beiyang warlord）government in China as a bridge for aggression against China. Since the Qing government or the Beiyang warlord government could exist苟且偷生的（in a state of temporary ease）, the U.S. imperialism was happy to loudly advocate the principle of non-interference in China's internal affairs in order to achieve the purpose of aggression. This is the reason why the United States hypocritically advocates non-interference in China's internal affairs. This means that around the time of the Xinhai Revolution, although the U.S. imperialism was secretly interfering in China's internal affairs, it had not yet openly stated that it must interfere in China's internal affairs.
    However, after the Chinese proletariat was awakened, the situation has greatly changed. Now, if the American monopoly capitalist class wants to continue to engage in capital aggression in China, the resistance they encounter is not only the weak national capitalist class, but also the strong proletariat and peasant class. From the standpoint of American monopoly capital, if the U.S. government continues to adopt a policy of non-interference, then, with the success and consolidation of the proletarian revolution, its policy of aggression will inevitably fail. Therefore, the U.S. government also simply abandoned its principle of not openly interfering in China's internal affairs, and turned to actively and openly advocating interference in China's internal affairs. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson said in a letter to President Truman, "It is precisely on this point that the two basic principles of U.S. policy toward China—non-interference in China's internal affairs and support for China's unity and territorial integrity—have come into conflict." He then took steps to openly interfere in China's internal affairs. Why did the United States openly declare that it wanted to interfere in China's internal affairs? Obviously, it is because the degree of awareness of the Chinese workers and peasants is increasing day by day, and it is believed that the strength of the Chinese reactionary government alone is absolutely insufficient to repel the high tide of the Chinese revolution, and the result will inevitably hinder the outward expansion of American monopoly capitalism. Therefore, it妄想（vainly hopes） to help the reactionary Chiang regime in China with various weapons in an attempt to defeat the revolutionary regime in China. Unless the American economic system evolves from a monopoly capitalist system to a socialist economic system, its continued interference in China's internal affairs to maintain the preservation and expansion of American monopoly capital is an unquestionable fact.
    But can this interference succeed? Not only will it not succeed, but it will inevitably lead to the subversion and extinction of American monopoly capitalism. Why is it said that it will definitely not succeed? Because the reactionary forces that the United States is now eager to create and support are the so-called democratic individualism. But does China really have democratic individualism? If so, then what class interests does democratic individualism represent? Among the Chinese population, more than 80 percent are peasant masses, and about 10 percent are the working class. They absolutely do not believe in democratic individualism, but believe in the "people's democratic dictatorship." Before the collapse of the Chiang regime, although there were a few so-called "free intellectuals," in fact, they were all "autocratic masters." Although they had publicly declared that they wanted to be believers in democratic individualism, after the disintegration of the Chiang regime, even these few free intellectuals, because of the changes in the environment and self-awareness, most of them have gradually abandoned the democratic individualism they believed in in the past and turned to believe in the "people's democratic dictatorship." Moreover, I dare to assert that their transformation is entirely due to the spontaneous transformation of thought, and not due to any other external reasons. Because the people's democratic dictatorship not only has the advantages of democratic individualism, but also surpasses its development, no wonder they want to abandon democratic individualism and turn to believe in the people's democratic dictatorship. True democratic individualism is the product of the emerging capitalist production system in Europe and America in the early 19th century. Although students who returned from Europe and America brought the consciousness of democratic individualism to China, they never imported the emerging capitalist production system of Europe and America in the early 19th century into China as well. 江南有橘移至淮北，虽不为橘，尚且为枳（The oranges in the south are transplanted to the north of the Huai River, and although they are no longer oranges, they are still枳(zhǐ) [a trifoliate orange].）。 When European and American democratic individualism moved to China, because it lacked the basis of a capitalist production system, it became a kite with a broken string. It did not last long, and now even its shadow is gone. Since democratic individualism is gone, but the United States is still willing to provide economic and military assistance, then, will not these military and economic assistance eventually become weapons to support the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people batch by batch? What success can there be?
    But why is it said that this interventionism must lead to the subversion and extinction of American monopoly capitalism itself? This reason is also extremely obvious. According to the estimation of economist Dr. Kalecki, although American monopoly capitalism has increased American labor productivity, it has distorted the distribution of American national income. From 1919 to 1934, the income of the American working class accounted for only about 36 percent of the total national income. Great Britain's labor productivity is lower than that of the United States, but from 1924 to 1935, the income of the British working class accounted for about 43 percent of the total national income (Kalecki Economic Flucluations P.16-17). Although the material enjoyment of American workers is higher than that of the British working class, the mental suffering of American workers is greater than that of Great Britain. Because the relative wages of the American working class are actually lower than those of Great Britain, or the relative degree of poverty is greater. The relative degree of poverty of the American working class is already large enough. If the overseas investment plan of the American monopoly capitalist class succeeds, then the relative income of the American monopoly capitalist class will inevitably be more, and at the same time, the relative wages of the American working class will be even lower. As the relative wages of the American working class are increasingly reduced, the support of the broad masses of people for the American monopoly capitalist class in its foreign aggression will be less and less. Once a world war breaks out, it is extremely obvious that the American working class will hardly be able to shed blood for the interests of the monopoly capitalist class, which exploits themselves and enslaves the world. Furthermore, from the perspective of the exploited foreign nations, such as Korea and China, they have already tasted the taste of exploitation by American monopoly capitalism, and they are determined to use the weapons of democratic unity to drive the aggressive U.S. imperialism out of the country. The result will be that the quantity of American exports will further decrease. Once American exports lack a suitable market, American worker unemployment will increase sharply. With the sharp increase in unemployment and the sharp reduction in wages, the degree of resentment of the working class towards the monopoly capitalist class will inevitably be higher. Lacking sympathy from the outside and support from the inside, the reproduction process of monopoly capital will inevitably shrink downwards. And it is already shrinking. Unless the American monopoly capitalist class is destroyed, the American people cannot survive. Therefore, I say that the American policy of active intervention will inevitably lead to the subversion and extinction of American monopoly capitalism itself.
    However, American monopoly capitalism absolutely cannot but make a dying struggle to prolong its own life. The method of this struggle is to transfer their surplus labor productivity to the manufacture of weapons of war. Before the war, in 1939, U.S. military spending accounted for only 13 percent of the government budget. After the war, in 1950, U.S. defense spending reached more than 14 billion yuan, accounting for more than one-third of the entire budget. This is the result of the United States' militarization after the war—expanding armaments and implementing universal military training (People's Daily, August 5, 1938, fourth edition, as stated by柯伯年 (Ke Bonian)). Now the economic crisis in the United States is deepening, and militarism will inevitably expand upwards.
    But are we afraid? No, absolutely not. Because most of the weapons that the United States uses to threaten the world are atomic bombs. May I ask, to what extent is the destructive power of atomic bombs? According to the estimation made by Professor Blackett, a member of the British Atomic Energy Advisory Committee, winner of last year's Nobel Prize, and professor of physics at the University of Manchester in England, in his famous book "Atomic Energy and Its Military and Political Consequences," the actual destructive power of an atomic bomb is about equal to 2,000 ordinary bombs. He took Germany as an example in World War II. The United Kingdom and the United States dropped about 1.35 million tons of bombs on Germany, killing 500,000 people. But it did not really damage Germany's combat effectiveness (for example, if the German arms production in 1940 is 100, then it was 146 in 1942; 229 in 1943; and even reached 285 in 1944. The output of other aircraft also increased in the same way, and I will not cite figures here). These 1.35 million tons of ordinary bombs are equivalent to 675 atomic bombs. Even if atomic research has made progress after the war, it must at least be equivalent to 400 new-type atomic bombs! Therefore, the power of atomic bombs is not mysterious and unpredictable (see Feng Binfu's quote in the Zhongjian Bimonthly Magazine, December 5, 1937). China is more than ten times larger than Germany, and its industries are decentralized. Even if U.S. imperialism drops 4,000 atomic bombs on China, can it be sure that it will not suffer final defeat?
    Moreover, the American working class is afraid that they will absolutely not be willing to help the American monopoly capitalist class—their own enemies—engage in aggressive wars. Now the camp of peace is strong, and the United States is full of insurmountable contradictions. We should have no fear of U.S. imperialism. On the other hand, we only seek to treat countries that treat us equally with a spirit of坚苦卓绝（arduous struggle）, help each other, and move forward hand in hand on the road of production and construction. U.S. imperialism is like a hideous and hateful僵尸（zombie, stiff corpse）. As long as we can dodge and let him miss once, his corpse will immediately collapse.

　　从根本上认识美帝
    北大教授  樊弘
    美国是一个独占资本主义最发达的国家。无疑的，美国的一切外交政策均必要以保持和扩大美国的独占资本的再生产为目的。美国是否能够做到既不采取资本侵略的政策，而亦可以维持美国的独占资本于不坠呢？这当然是不可能的。依据资产阶级经济学者柯蒲兰特（Ｄｏｕｇｌａｓ　Ｃｏｐｌａｎｄ）教授的估计，美国的独占资本主义，虽然在生产上已创造出了一个史无前例的纪录，可是，在销路上，确是狭窄万状。他在一九四七年九月来北大演讲说：“在此刻，美国每年的出口货约为二○○亿美圆，但入口货约值八○亿美圆。如果外国想要继续买进美国的货物，那么，这个一二○亿美圆的大缺口便必要能弥补。如果这个缺口不能以某种形式的美圆的供给来弥补，那么，外国用以买进美货的美圆必感缺乏，出口货必致减少。如果美国的出口货每减少十亿美圆，假令美国国内的需要不变，那么，美国至少便将有一百万工人的失业。”（原文载于一九四七年九月二十七日北平英文时事日报第二版）这一段话明白表示，美国政府如不向外攫取投资地，并向外国继续投资，使得外国能以美国所放借的美圆来买美国的出口货，那么，美国的一二○亿美圆的剩余物资便将无法销售，同时美国便将有千万人以上的失业。这即是说，美国的独占资本主义便将为突然的崩溃。由此可见，美国政府的外交政策，无论穿上什么美丽的糖衣，他必要以攫取投资市场为目的。
    但美帝又是否能够做到既不干涉中国内政而亦可以夺取中国的投资市场呢？这点可分两个阶段来说明。在中国被压榨的工农大众尚未觉醒以前，美国倘来中国攫取投资的市场，虽然也可遇着民族资本家们的反抗，但因中国的民族资本家们的实力不强大，美国政府只须利用现存的封建政府作工具，来镇压中国的民族资本家们的反抗，并接受美帝所加的不平等的条约，以便利美国对华输出的增加，或投资的增加，不问中国统一也好，不统一也好，美帝的投资的目的也可一样的到达，美帝自然不觉有何公开干涉中国内政的必要。在辛亥革命前后，美国的政府端在扶植中国的昏庸无知的满清政府或北洋军阀政府，来作侵略中国的桥梁。满清政府或北洋军阀政府既然可以苟且偷生的存在，美帝于是乐得高唱不干涉中国内政的原则，以达侵略的目的。这便是美国的虚伪的高唱不干涉中国内政的原因。这即是说，在辛亥革命前后，美帝虽在暗地的干涉中国的内政，但尚没有把他公开，说他必要干涉中国的内政。
    可是在中国的无产阶级既觉醒后，情势已经大有改变，即美国的独占资本家阶级，如欲继续到中国来从事资本的侵略，此时，他们所遇着的反抗便不仅是软弱无力的民族资本家阶级，并且是强壮有力的无产阶级和农民阶级。从美国独占资本的立场，美国政府如果再采不干涉主义，那么，伴着无产者阶级革命的成功和巩固，他的侵略的外交的政策便非失败不可了。因此美国政府也就很干脆的抛弃了他的不公开的干涉中国内政的原则，转作积极的公开的干涉中国内政的主张了。美国国务卿艾奇逊在致杜鲁门总统的信函上说，“正在此点上，美国对华政策上两个基本原则——不干涉中国内政以及支持中国之统一与领土完整便发生了冲突”。他于是采取了公开干涉中国内政的步骤。为什么美国要公开的宣言说他要干涉中国的内政呢？很明显的，是因中国的工农阶级的觉悟程度日高，以为单凭中国反动政府的力量绝对不足以击退中国革命的高潮，其结果势将有碍于美国独占资本主义向外的膨胀。因而妄想以各种的武器来帮助中国的反动的蒋政权，以图打垮中国的革命的政权。除非美国的经济制度由独占的资本主义制度进化而为社会主义的经济制度，他之要继续干涉中国内政，以维持美国的独占资本的保存和扩大，乃是一种无可置疑的事。
    但这干涉能够成功吗？他不但不能成功，反必造成美国独占资本主义的颠覆和绝灭。为什么说一定不能成功呢？因为美国现在所急欲制造并扶植的反动势力，乃是他们所说的民主个人主义。但中国果有民主个人主义么？假如说有，那么，民主个人主义所代表的究竟是些什么阶级的利益呢？在中国人口之中，占百分之八十以上的是农民大众。约占百分之十的是工人阶级。他们绝不相信民主个人主义，但相信“人民民主专政”。在蒋政权未崩溃前，虽有少数所谓“自由分子”，实则尽是“武断大师”，他们虽曾公开宣言他们要做民主个人主义的信徒，但在蒋政权既瓦解后，即这少数的自由分子，因为环境的变迁和自我的觉醒，其中大多数亦已逐渐放弃他们昔日所相信的民主个人主义，转而相信“人民民主专政”了。而且我敢断言，他们的转变完全是出于思想的自发的改造，绝非由于其他的任何外在的原因。因为人民民主专政，不但具有民主个人主义的好处，而且超过了他的发展，莫怪他们要放弃民主个人主义转而相信人民民主专政了。真正的民主个人主义乃是十九世纪初叶欧美新兴的资本家生产制度的产物。从欧美返国的留学生虽把民主个人主义的意识带到中国来了，但他们却从没有把十九世纪初叶欧美新兴的资本家的生产制度，也一样向中国输入。江南有橘移至淮北，虽不为橘，尚且为枳。欧美的民主个人主义移到中国，因为缺乏资本家的生产制度作依据，竟成一叶断线的风筝，为时没有好久，现在几连形影都不见了。民主个人主义既不见了，但美国尚愿给以经济和军火的援助，那么，这些军火和经济的援助，结果岂不是又要变成了一批批的支援中国人民革命势力的武器么？尚何成功之有？
    但何以又说这种干涉主义一定要造成美国独占资本主义自己的颠覆和灭绝呢？这个道理也极其明显。依据经济学家卡勒兹岂博士的估计，美国独占资本主义虽然增加了美国的劳动生产力，但却歪置了美国国民所得的分配。从一九一九年到一九三四年之间，美国工人阶级的所得只占全部国民所得的百分之三十六左右。大不列颠比较美国的劳动生产能力低，但在一九二四年到一九三五年之间，大不列颠的工人阶级的所得，反占全部国民所得的百分之四十三上下（Ｋａｌｅｃｋｉ　Ｅｃｏｎｏｍｉｃ　Ｆｌｕｃｌｕａｔｉｏｎｓ　Ｐ．１６—１７）美国工人的物质享受虽比大不列颠的工人阶级更高，但美国工人阶级的精神苦痛则比大不列颠更大。因为美国的工人阶级的相对工资实比大不列颠更低，或相对的贫困程度更大。美国工人阶级的相对贫困程度已经够大了。设使美国的独占资本家阶级的对外投资计划成功，那末，美国的独占资本家阶级的相对的所得势必更多，同时美国的工人阶级的相对工资势将更低。随着美国工人阶级的相对工资的越见降低，美国独占资本家阶级在对外侵略上所得的劳苦大众的支援势将越少。一旦世界战争爆发，美国工人的阶级势难再向剥削他们自己和奴役世界的独占资本家阶级的利益而流血，这是极明显的。再从被剥削的异民族来说，例如朝鲜与中国，他们业已饱尝美国独占资本主义剥削的滋味，他们决心要以民主联合的武器将美帝的侵略主义逐出国门之外，其结果将是美国出口货物的数量更将往下再降低。一旦美国的出口货缺乏适当的市场，美国的工人的失业更将激增。失业激增，工资锐减，工人阶级对独占资本家阶级怨怼的程度势将更高。外失同情，内乏支援，独占资本的再生产过程势将往下萎缩。而且现在已经在萎缩了。除非美国的独占资本家阶级灭亡，美国人民大众不能幸存。所以，我说，美国的积极干涉的政策终必造成美国独占资本主义自己的颠覆和灭绝。
    但美国的独占资本主义绝对不能不为一种垂死的挣扎，来延长他自己的寿命。这个挣扎的方法，就是转移他们剩余的劳动生产力来制造战争的武器。在战前的一九三九年美国军费支出只占政府预算底百分之十三。在战后的一九五○年美国国防支出达一四○亿圆以上，占整个预算底三分之一而有余。这就是美国在战后进行军国主义化——扩张军备及实施普遍军事训练的成果（人民日报三十八年八月五日第四版柯伯年所述）。现在美国的经济危机正在加深，军国主义势将更要往上扩充。
    但我们怕不怕呢？不，绝不。因为美国所持以威胁世界的武器大半就是原子弹。试问原子弹的破坏威力大到什么程度呢？依据英国原子能顾问委员会委员，去年诺贝尔奖金的获得者，英国曼彻斯特大学物理教授勃拉开特（Ｐｒｏｆ　Ｂｌａｃｋｅｔｔ）在他的名著“原子能及其军事和政治上的后果”（Ａｔｏｍｉｃ　ｅｎｅｒｇｙ　ａｎｄ　ｉｔｓ　ｍｉｌｉｌａｒｙ　ａｎｄ　ｐ　ｌｉｔｉｃａｌ　ｃｏｎｓｅｑｉｅｎｃｅ）一书上所作的估计，一颗原子弹的实际炸毁力约等于二千颗普通炸弹。他以第二次世界大战中德国为例，英美投于德国的炸弹，约为一百三十五万吨，共炸死了五十万人。但也并没有真正折损了德国的作战力（例如倘以一九四○年德国军火生产为一○○，则一九四二年为一四六；一九四三年为二二九；一九四四年更达二八五。其他飞机产量亦同样增加，此处不另举数字）。这一百三十五万吨的普通炸弹相当于六百七十五颗原子弹。纵令战后原子研究已有进步，至少也得相当于四百颗新型原子弹！所以原子弹的威力并不是神秘莫测的（见中建半月刊三十七年十二月五日冯宾符所引）。中国比德国大十倍多而且产业是分散的。美帝纵令就向中国投下四千颗原子弹，难道他就可以有把握的说，他不会遭致最后的失败吗？
    而且美国工人阶级恐怕绝不愿意帮助美国的独占资本家阶级——他们自己的敌人，从事侵略的战争。现在和平的阵营已强大，美国又充满着不可克服的矛盾，我们理应对美帝无所恐怖。在他方面我们但求以一种坚苦卓绝的精神与世界以平等待我之国家，互相帮助，共同的向着生产建设之途，手牵手的迈步而进。美帝好比一个狰狞可憎的僵尸，我们只要能够躲闪开，让他扑空一次，他的尸身立将倾覆。
