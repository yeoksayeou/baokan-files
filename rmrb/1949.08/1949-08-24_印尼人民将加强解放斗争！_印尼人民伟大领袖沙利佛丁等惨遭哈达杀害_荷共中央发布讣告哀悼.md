　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 23rd: TASS, The Hague, August 21st dispatch, the Dutch Communist Party's "Truth Daily" published an obituary on the front page, mourning the outstanding leaders of the working class and leaders of the Indonesian Communist Party: Sharifuddin, Musso, Darosman, Harino, and Sulipno, who were brutally murdered. According to recent materials, the Hatta group, with the direct support of foreign imperialist groups, actually shot the above-mentioned leaders in Solo several months ago. The Dutch Communist Party's "Truth Daily" published portraits of Sharifuddin and Musso, framed in black, writing: We are deeply saddened by the confirmed fact that former Prime Minister and member of the Political Bureau of the Indonesian Communist Party, Sharifuddin, and others were murdered. Hatta and his gang (who are now all in the Netherlands) have been forced to admit to killing Indonesian working-class leaders Sharifuddin and Musso, after being questioned by democrats in the Netherlands and Indonesia. Hatta had to admit this only after being repeatedly questioned by one of the leaders of the Indonesian Students' Union in the Netherlands. The Dutch Communist Party's "Truth Daily" published a biography of Sharifuddin, emphasizing his role in the struggle against Japanese fascism and in organizing the national liberation movement. Sharifuddin was the main figure in organizing the Indonesian people's resistance against Japanese imperialism. He was a true patriot—he fought for the happy future of Indonesia and for a socialist society under the banner of proletarian internationalism. The newspaper pointed out: Hatta, with the help of the United States, first overthrew Sharifuddin's government and then killed Sharifuddin himself. The newspaper wrote: For nearly twenty-five years, Sharifuddin was one of the most powerful leaders of the Indonesian revolutionary movement and a leader of various organizations. The Dutch Communist Party's "Truth Daily" also highly praised the role of Musso, the Secretary-General of the Indonesian Communist Party, who was killed after the Madiun Affair last September. The newspaper also published biographies of Sulipno, the former representative of the Republic to Prague who was killed, and Harino, the leader of the Indonesian Trade Union (which has been accepted as a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions).
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 23rd: TASS, The Hague, August 22nd dispatch, the Dutch Communist Party's "Truth Daily" published a statement from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Netherlands, stating: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Netherlands announces with extreme grief the confirmed death of the outstanding leaders of the Indonesian workers and peasants—Sharifuddin, member of the Political Bureau of the Indonesian Communist Party, Sulipno, member of the Political Bureau of the Indonesian Communist Party, and Harino—leader of the Indonesian trade union movement. They sacrificed themselves in the struggle for the freedom of the Indonesian people, and they were executed by people from the Hatta group on December 23, 1948. The statement also stated: The murder of these fearless Indonesian people's leaders "will further inspire millions of Indonesian people to continue the struggle for the complete liberation of the country." The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Netherlands called on the Dutch working people to warmly express their solidarity with the Indonesian people's struggle.
