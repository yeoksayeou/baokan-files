Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, August 25th: The long-rumored so-called “High-Level Financial Conference” of the United States, Britain, and Canada is scheduled to be held in Washington starting September 6th. The finance ministers and foreign ministers of the three countries will attend this meeting. Prior to the official meeting, the three countries will also hold a so-called "technical and fact-finding preparatory meeting" starting August 27th.

The Washington conference is being convened at the suggestion of the British government in early July. At that time, the finance ministers of the United States, Britain, and Canada held inconclusive economic talks in London. The main agenda of the Washington conference will be to discuss the dollar crisis in the sterling area. London has repeatedly issued news about the extreme seriousness of this problem. According to estimates by London financial circles in mid-August, the entire sterling area's dollar and gold reserves will be completely exhausted before June 30th of next year.

According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from London on the 20th, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps and Foreign Secretary Bevin, who are preparing to attend this meeting, are finalizing their proposals to be presented to the United States and Canada in the Washington negotiations. Reuters reported on the same day that the suggestions the United Kingdom will make to the conference include: (1) Requesting the United States to increase its purchases of rubber and tin from the sterling area; (2) Requesting a reduction in US tariffs on British goods and a reduction in subsidies for US goods that compete with British exports; (3) Requesting the signing of international commodity agreements to guarantee the prices of goods purchased from the sterling area; (4) Requesting an increase in the price of gold. As for the United States' position, according to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 20th, one of the United States' important proposals will be to insist that Cripps and Bevin agree to a devaluation of the pound sterling, that is, a significant reduction from the current exchange rate of four dollars and three cents per pound. To prepare the US government's proposals, a technical committee led by Undersecretary of State Webb has been working for weeks.

At a time when the economic difficulties of both the United States and Britain are becoming increasingly serious, and when both sides are proposing suggestions that sacrifice the other to benefit themselves, what is the likely future of the Washington conference? An Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 20th pointed out: "An atmosphere of failure already hangs over the US-UK conference next month to discuss the British economic crisis." The agency also stated that officials in the Truman administration and British economic and political experts anticipate that "the two sides have little chance of reaching agreement at the conference on a broad plan of action."

　　美英加三国金融谈判笼罩着一片失败空气
    英镑想在美元圈套中挣扎美帝图继续压迫英镑贬值
    【新华社北平二十五日电】传闻已久的所谓美英加“高级金融会议”，定于九月六日起在华盛顿举行。美英加三国的财长与外长，都将出席这一会议。在举行正式会议之前，三国并将于八月二十七日起举行所谓“技术性的与调查事实的预备会议”。
    华盛顿会议的召开，是根据英政府七月初旬的建议。当时，美英加三国财长曾在伦敦举行未获结果的经济谈判。华盛顿会议的主要议程，将是讨论英镑区域的美元危机问题。伦敦方面曾一再传出这一问题之极其严重的消息。据伦敦金融界人士八月中旬的估计，整个英镑区域的美元与黄金储备，将在明年六月三十日以前完全用罄。
    据法新社伦敦二十日消息称：准备参加此一会议的英财长克利浦斯与英外长贝文，正在最后完成他们准备在华盛顿谈判中对美加提出的建议。又据路透社同日消息称，英国将向会议提出的建议，计有：（一）要求美国增加自英镑区域购买橡胶与锡的数量；（二）要求降低美国对英货所课的关税，并减低对与英国出口货竞争的美货津贴；（三）要求签订国际商品协定，保障购自英镑区域的货物的价格；（四）要求提高黄金价格。至于美国方面的主张，据美联社华盛顿二十日消息报道：美国的重要对案之一将是坚持地要求克利浦斯和贝文同意英镑贬值，即自目前每英镑换四美元另三分的比价大大地降低。为了准备美国政府的建议，由副国务卿韦伯领导的技术委员会已工作数周之久。
    当此美国和英国的经济困难都日益严重之时，当美英双方都提出牺牲对方有利于本身的建议的情形下，华盛顿会议的可能前途如何呢？美联社华盛顿二十日的消息指出：“关于美英下月召开的讨论英国经济危机的会议，已笼罩着一片失败空气。”该社又称：杜鲁门政府的官员及英国经济政治专家预料，“双方很少有机会将在会议上对一个行动的广泛计划达到协议”。
