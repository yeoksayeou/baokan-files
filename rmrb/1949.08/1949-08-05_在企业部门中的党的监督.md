    Party Supervision in Enterprise Departments
    Ananyev, Secretary of the Leningrad Regional Committee
    It is well known that people are the key to the success of all undertakings. To enhance the role of Party grassroots organizations means first and foremost to improve their work, to educate and mobilize people to complete the tasks before us. Therefore, Comrade Losev is absolutely correct in emphasizing in his letter to the Pravda editorial department that we often only see the percentage of plan completion and fail to see the living people, often forgetting that these percentages themselves, even in factories, are determined by the degree of activity of the entire Party grassroots organization and every Communist Party member.

    In this connection, I would like to talk about the issue of Party supervision. Granting Party grassroots organizations the right to supervise the activities of administrative departments is precisely to enhance the role and responsibility of Party grassroots organizations in the production work of enterprises, including state farms, collective farms, and tractor stations.

    Currently, it is particularly important to strengthen the responsibility of Party organizations for the underlying quality indicators of enterprise work. Here, we have changed the focus of grassroots organizations in our district regarding product quality, the economic organization of enterprises, and other issues. At present, Party grassroots organizations are not only paying attention to total output but also analyzing and studying all technical and economic indicators. For example, the Party organization of the Kirov Factory has begun to delve into accounting statements. As a result, many Communist Party members have exposed numerous serious waste phenomena in production leadership.

    At the same time, many Party organizations are not content with completing the tasks they have accepted but are beginning to boldly propose and solve the problem of how to adapt to the current tasks of Leningrad industry and develop their own factories and workshops. For example, a long-term plan for the rubber technology product factory was determined due to the initiative of Communist Party members. The Party organization not only raised a series of important issues to the administration, pointing out the reserve resources that could be utilized, but also mobilized the creative initiative of engineers, technicians, and workers to complete the plan. According to this plan, it is stipulated to use new equipment and produce a large number of new, technically greatly improved products.

    From similar facts, we see the ever-increasing economic knowledge of the activists. At present, the most important thing is to enable Party workers to analyze all production problems with professional knowledge and delve into details; without this, there can be no smooth leadership. It should be particularly pointed out that we have opened supplementary classes for studying socialist political economy. In this training class, all theoretical issues are closely integrated with concrete economic problems of production. More than a hundred people have participated in the study. Socialist political economy supplementary classes have also been established in the largest enterprise departments in the district. In addition, lectures on the most important economic issues are systematically held in the district.

    The serious preparation of activists' economic knowledge will undoubtedly make the Party's supervision of enterprise administrative business activities more profound and practical. But practical experience tells us that we must always pay attention to the methods of supervision, and we must also improve the quality of Party member activists in this area.

    The Party committee of the "Metal Worker" factory in our district often made resolutions after listening to the reports of the administrative负责人, but the Communist Party members actually stood far outside the event. What was the result? Both the Communist Party members and the factory leaders went down the road of commandism. Commandism in Party work is bound to cause harm to the cause. The ending in the "Metal Worker" factory was like this. There, the enthusiasm of the Communist Party members and their sense of responsibility for working for the factory were not improved. Because the Party committee often replaced the administration, the principle of managing the factory was undermined. And finally, it even led to the Party committee often neglecting the most important departments of enterprise activities. For example, the Party committee turned a blind eye to incidents of violating financial discipline, resulting in the factory's finances being in an extremely difficult situation. There is no doubt that this situation would not have occurred under the conditions of the entire Party organization and all Communist Party members participating in supervision.

    Supervision of administrative business activities, as an important condition for the Party organization to actively fight for the interests of the country and to utilize all production reserve forces, can only become true supervision when it is mass-based, when it guarantees to attract all Communist Party members to participate in active discussions and decisions on the most important production issues.

    To this end, the most important production issues must first be brought to the Party meeting for discussion. But there are often situations where production issues can often be encountered on the agenda of the meeting, but nothing is ever achieved. What is the reason? Because there is no real supervision of administrative business activities, because the enthusiasm of Party members is low. This situation can even be confirmed by the following facts: in general, only a few people speak in the discussion, and the speeches of these few people are often routine reports.

    But in the Kirov Factory, the discussion of production issues is often heated and intense. Among the hundred people who spoke in four months, many were speaking for the first time. This shows that the Party organization is good at arousing the interest of Party members in production issues and is good at increasing the sense of responsibility of Communist Party members for working for the factory. What is the key to achieving this success? First of all, it lies in being good at selecting problems, sharply raising problems, and carefully and accurately studying and discussing problems.

    The Party organization is an independent political organization. Its task is to help the administration. But the Party organization is an organization independent of the administration, so only the interests of the Party and the country guide the work of the Party organization, and it is not bound by routine affairs. Only in this case can it provide assistance to economic work cadres—educating them is the responsibility of the Party organization. We are striving for the Party workers of the grassroots Party organizations to choose and prepare the issues that need to be discussed at the Party meeting based on this principle. What is the practical content of this principle? Our usual method of supervising the business activities of enterprises is to regularly listen to the summary reports of economic work leaders on the work of the enterprise. There is no doubt that this kind of general summary report is needed. But when work summary reports can only be heard in full around January, the beneficial effect of this kind of work summary report has been reduced. Observing the business activities of enterprise departments, for example, for half a year or a year, is an important matter. This will give us a comprehensive understanding of the situation, the possibility of raising the most concise questions, and deeply exposing shortcomings, but in addition to general work summary reports, reports on individual separate issues are also very beneficial.

    The Party organization should delve into; implementing new production technology and skills, the work of rationalization advocates and inventors, the organization of labor, supervising the quality of finished products, the administration's concern for meeting workers' cultural and living requirements, and other issues. This kind of issue is often touched upon in the agenda of our Party grassroots organization meetings. (⑵⑶)

    But it would be a big mistake to summarize Party supervision as merely listening to reports from leaders of economic work. Is it possible that our activists, the majority of ordinary Party members, people who are prepared, cannot study this or that issue of the factory and make a report at the Party meeting? There is no problem, they can do this. The work experience of the Party organizations of the "Soviet Star" United Factory, "Red Triangle," and other factories fully confirms this. In these enterprise departments, Party activists often make extremely valuable reports. Experience tells us that the objective attitude starting from reality, the novelty of suggestions, and the sharpness of the questions raised are the characteristics of these reports. Therefore, discussions on these issues are usually carried out enthusiastically and actively. It should also be pointed out that there is a good side to this experience: it promotes Communist Party members, especially activists, to begin to delve deeper into enterprise undertakings.

    But no matter what form is used to raise production issues for discussion at the Party meeting, it is an extremely necessary condition to make as many Communist Party members as possible participate in the discussion. Only under such conditions can the Party organization deeply analyze the facts, get rid of the influence of all contingencies, determine its own views, and formulate a correct plan of action.

    In recent times, our Dzerzhinsky Factory has achieved great results. Labor productivity is increasing, and the quality of products is improving. Here, let's take the Third Factory as an example. In a short period of time, the average output of cotton cloth in the Third Factory increased from 20,000 meters to 30,000 meters, while the number of first-class products increased from 70% to 90%. There are no more backward workers who cannot complete the production quota. Nine thousand meters of cloth were produced under the item of saving raw materials. When you analyze and study the work of the Party organization, you will clearly see where the secret of these achievements lies. The secret lies first of all in the fact that ninety ordinary Party members participated in the study of production problems that urgently need to be solved. When the Party organization studied product quality and saving raw materials, 500 Party members participated in the discussion of these issues. Many Communist Party members have delved deeply into economic activity departments that they previously considered difficult to understand. For example, they carefully studied how to calculate raw materials, register materials, and discovered many shortcomings. Overcoming these shortcomings can save hundreds of thousands of rubles.

    It is obvious that people who not only discuss problems based on reports but also experience the reality of work themselves will have opinions to express at the meeting. They criticize all shortcomings realistically. Contribute valuable opinions. Naturally, under these conditions, resolutions with rich content and the responsibility of Communist Party members to complete the resolutions will be increased.

    What should the resolutions made by the Party grassroots organizations in exercising the right to supervise the administrative activities of enterprises be like? We still need to clarify this issue. There are often situations where the resolution of the Party organization is exactly the same as the director's instructions: the resolution has all the details, how the workshop should be, how each department should be, and how its leaders should be. The Party organization cannot replace the factory director. It acts through the factory director and has the right to ask the factory director to eliminate the shortcomings revealed by the Party meeting and implement various measures to ensure the successful completion of the tasks facing the factory and workshop.

    But this is not enough. It is also wrong to just make a resolution such as "Decide to notify the factory director, who will issue a certain designation" and be done with it. The Party organization has many methods unique to completing economic tasks. First of all, it refers to raising the awareness of the people, mobilizing the people to implement the various measures that have been decided: political encouragement, leading socialist competitions, improving the combativeness of Party groups, and many other methods. This may and must show the plan that the Party organization has prescribed for itself to implement. Paying attention to listening to the suggestions of Communist Party members is the most important condition for correctly implementing Party supervision. Every practical and useful suggestion must be considered and utilized. Without this, there can be no talk of increasing the enthusiasm of Party members in enterprises. Therefore, the Party organization must firmly adhere to this policy. Why can production issues be discussed frequently and intensely in the Kirov Memorial Factory mentioned above? Because Communist Party members here believe that if they point out shortcomings, then these shortcomings will be overcome, and believe that their suggestions will be effective. There was also such a thing in the factory: the roof of a workshop in a steelmaking plant had to be replaced. According to the construction plan, it had to be shut down for forty-five days, which would disrupt the production plan and stagnate the work of other enterprise departments that receive pure steel from the steelmaking plant. Communist Party member Vinogradov proposed a way to replace the roof without shutting down the factory. The suggestion was implemented and achieved good results.

    Our district committee and the Party committees in various factories pay special attention to the Party's supervision of enterprise activities. We are overcoming the shortcomings in this area and enriching the accumulation of experience. The district committee studied the organizational work of Party supervision in "Red Triangle," "Kirov," "Metal Worker," and other factories, and the study of supervision issues is being carried out in the activist supplementary classes. We strive to make supervision worthy of its name, to make it a more powerful weapon for educating leading cadres and all Communist Party members, and a weapon for improving the level of work in our factories and workshops.

### 在企业部门中的党的监督

    在企业部门中的党的监督
    列宁格勒区委书记  阿南耶夫
    谁都知道，人是决定一切事业成功的关键。提高党的基层组织的作用——这首先即是改进它的工作，以教育与动员人们完成摆在我们面前的任务。因之洛谢天同志是完全正确的，在给真理报编辑部的信里他强调指出，我们往往除了完成计划的百分数以外看不见活的人，往往忘记，即如在工场中的这些百分数本身乃是由整个党的基层组织与每个共产党员的积极性的程度来决定的。
    与此相关，我想谈一谈党的监督问题。赋予党的基层组织以监督行政部门的活动的权利，正是为了提高党的基层组织对企业部门包括国营农场、集体农场与托拉机站等的生产工作状况的作用和责任。
    目前特别重要的是加强党的组织对企业工作底质量指数的责任。这里我们已经改变了本区的基层组织对产品质量、企业的经济组织等问题的转变。目前党的基础组织不仅注意到总出产量，而且正在分析研究一切技术——经济的指数。例如，基洛夫工厂的党的组织已开始注意钻研会计决算。因而许多共产党员揭露出了在生产领导中的许许多多的严重浪费现象。
    同时许多党的组织并不满足于完成已接受的任务，而开始勇敢地提出并解决如何适应列宁格勒工业当前任务，来发展自己的制造厂与工场的问题。例如，由于共产党员的主动发起确定了橡胶技术产品制造厂的长远计划。党的组织不仅在行政面前提出了一系例的重要的问题，指出可以利用的后备资源，而且为完成计划动员了工程技术工作者与工人的创造的自动性。按照这一计划，规定了使用新的装备品，出产大批新的、技术上大大改进了的产品。
    从类似的事实中，我们看到了日新月异的积极分子的经济知识。现时最重要的是使党的工作者善于以业务知识来分析一切生产问题，深入钻研细节，没有这一点就不可能有顺利的领导。特别要指出的是我们开办了研究社会主义政治经济的补习班。在这个训练班里，一切理论问题是和具体的生产的经济问题密切结合着的。参加学习的已有一百多人。在本区的最大的企业部门里也建立了社会主义政治经济补习班。此外，在本区里有系统地举行了关于最关重要的经济问题的讲座。
    积极分子的认真的经济知识的准备工作，毫无疑义是会使党对企业行政业务活动的监督变得更加深刻与更加实际。但实际经验告诉我们，必须经常注意到监督的方法，必须同时在这一方面也提高党员积极分子的质量。
    本区“金属工”制造厂的党委会每每在听取了行政负责人的报告以后，即做出决议，而共产党员实际上都远远站在事件之外。结果是怎样呢？无论对共产党员或制造厂的领导者们都走上了命令方式的道路。党的工作中的命令方式是一定会对事业招致危害的。“金属工”制造厂里的结局就是这样的。在那里，共产党员的积极性，他们的为工厂工作的责任心，并未提高。由于党委会往往代替了行政，因而破坏了管理工厂的原则。而且最后，竟至造成党委会往往忽略了企业活动底最重要的部门。例如，党委会对破坏财政纪律的事件熟视无睹，结果使工厂财政陷于极端困窘的地步。毫无疑问，在整个党组织与全体共产党员参加监督的条件下，是不会发生这种情况的。
    对行政业务活动的监督，作为党组织为了国家利益，为了利用一切生产后备力而积极斗争的重要条件之一，只有在这种监督是带有群众性的，在这种监督保证吸引全体共产党员参加积极讨论与决定最重要的生产问题的条件下，才能成为真正的监督。
    为此首先就要将最重要的生产问题，提到党的会议上来讨论。但往往有这种情况，即在会议的议事日程上常常也可以遇到些生产问题，但总是得不到什么结果。这是什么原因呢？因为没有真正的对行政业务活动的监督，因为党员的积极性低。这一情况甚至是可由下列事实证实：即在讨论中一般只有少数几个人发言，而且这几个人的发言往往也是些例行公事的作报告。
    但是在基洛夫工厂里对生产问题的讨论却经常是热烈紧张的。在四个月内发言的一百人中有许多是第一次发言的。这说明党的组织善于在生产问题上引起党员的兴趣，善于提高共产党员为工厂工作的责任心，取得这种成功的关键何在呢？首先这就在于善于选择问题，尖锐地提出问题，周密、精确的研究与讨论问题。
    党的组织乃是独立的政治组织。它的任务是帮助行政。但党的组织是独立于行政之外的组织，因之只有党与国家的利益指导着党的组织的工作，而不受例行公事的拘束，只有在这种情况下，它才能够给予经济工作干部——教育他们乃是党的组织的责任——以帮助。我们正在争取基层党组织的党的工作者从这一原则出发来选择和准备在党的会议上需要讨论的问题。这一原则的实际内容是什么呢？我们通常监督企业的业务活动的方法，乃是定期听取经济工作领导者关于企业的工作总结报告。毫无疑义这种一般性的工作总结报告是需要的。但当大约总是每到一月才能尽情听取工作总结报告的情况下，这种工作总结报告的有益作用已经减低了。对企业部门的业务活动，例如说作半年或一年的观察，是重要的事情。这会给予我们以全面的了解情况，提出最扼要的问题，深入地揭露缺点的可能性，但除了一般性的工作总结报告以外，关于个别单独问题的报告也是非常有益的。
    党的组织理应钻研；贯彻新的生产技术和技艺，对合理化倡导者与发明者的工作，劳动的组织，监督出产成品的质量，行政部门关于满足工人文化上生活上的要求底关怀等等问题。在我们的党的基层组织会议的议事日程上经常会接触到这一类的问题。（⑵⑶）
    但如将党的监督归纳为仅仅是听取经济工作的领导者的报告则是大错特错的。难道说，我们的积极分子，多数普通党员，有了准备的人们，就不能研究工厂的这类或那类的问题，并在党的会议上作出报告吗？不成问题，他们是能这样做的。“苏维埃之星”联合制造厂、“红三角”及其他制造厂的党的组织的工作经验，充分证实了这一点，在这些企业部门中的党的积极分子，经常作出极有价值的报告。经验告诉我们：从实际出发的客观态度、建议的新颖、提出问题的尖锐性，乃是这些报告的特点。因此关于这些问题的讨论，通常都是进行得热烈积极的。另外还应指出关于这一经验的一个好的一面：它推动着共产党员特别是积极分子们开始更深入地钻研企业事业。
    但不论是以怎样的形式在党的会议上提出讨论生产问题，尽可能使更多的共产党员来参加讨论乃是一个极其必要的条件。只有在这样的条件下，党的组织才能深刻地分析事实，摆脱一切偶然性的影响，确定自己的观点，规定正确的行动计划。
    最近一个时期，我们的捷尔仁斯基制造厂取得了巨大的成绩。劳动生产率正在提高，产品的质量正在改进。这里举第厂作一个例子。第三厂在短短的时期内棉布平均产量由二○、○○○米增长到三○、○○○米，同时一级产品数量，由百分之七十增长到百分之九十。再也找不到落后的，完不成生产定额的工人了。在节约原料项下出产了九千米布。当你分析研究党的组织的工作时，你会清楚的看到这些成就的秘密是在那里。这一秘密首先就在于有九十个普通党员参加了研究迫切要解决的生产问题。当着党的组织研究产品质量以及节约原料的时候，有党员五百人参加了讨论这些问题。许多共产党员深入钻研从前认为难于理解的经济活动部门。例如他们认真研究怎样进行计算原料，登记材料，并发现了许多缺点，克服这些缺点可节约数十万卢布。
    很明显，不单单是根据报告讨论问题，而自己设身处地体会过工作实情的人们，在会议上是会有意见发表的。他们实事求是地批评一切缺点。贡献有价值的意见。很自然，在这种条件下，是会产生出内容丰富的决议与提高共产党员为完成决议的责任心的。
    党的基础组织在实行对于企业行政活动监督权利当中所做的决议应该是怎样的呢？我们还须要弄清楚这一问题。常有这种情况，即党的组织的决议同厂长的指令是一模一样的：决议中详情细节应有尽有，车间应如何，各部门应如何以及其领导者又应如何如何。党的组织不能代替厂长。它通过厂长行动并有权利要厂长消除党的会议所揭露出来的缺点，实行保证顺利完成摆在制造厂与工场面前的任务的各种办法。
    但这还不够。只限于做出例如“决定通知厂长，由其发布某某指定”三言两语的决议，就算了事，也是错误的。党的组织是有许多在完成经济任务当中特有的方法。首先是指提高人民的觉悟性，动员人民去实行已经决定的各项措施：政治鼓励，领导社会主义竞赛，提高党的小组的斗争性，以及其他多种方法。这可能而且一定表现出党的组织为自己所规定执行的计划。注意倾听共产党员的建议，乃是正确执行党的监督的最重要的条件。必须推敲与利用每一个切实有用的建议。没有这一条，就谈不到提高党员在企业中的积极性。因此党的组织必须坚定这一方针。在上面讲到的纪念基洛夫制造厂里为什么经常能热烈紧张地讨论着生产问题呢？因为在这里的共产党员相信：如果他指出缺点，那么这些缺点就会克服，相信他的提议一定会收到效果。在制造厂里更有过这样一件事情：一个炼钢厂里的厂房棚顶曾必拆换，按照营缮构图，曾必须停工四十五天，这就要破坏生产计划，停滞其他从炼钢厂领取纯钢的企业部门底工作。共产党员维诺格拉道夫提出了工厂既不停工又能拆换房顶的办法。建议实现了，并得到了良好的效果。
    我们的区委会与各地制造厂里的党委会特别注意到对企业活动的党的监督工作。正在克服这一方面的缺点，丰富积累经验。区委会研究了在“红色三角形”、“基洛夫”、“金属工”及其他制造厂里的党的监督的组织工作，在积极分子补习班里正在进行着关于监督问题的学习。我们努力做到使监督名符其实，使它成为更有力的教育领导干部与全体共产党员的武器，成为提高我们的制造场与工场的工作水平的武器。（译自一九四九年一月十六日真理报）
