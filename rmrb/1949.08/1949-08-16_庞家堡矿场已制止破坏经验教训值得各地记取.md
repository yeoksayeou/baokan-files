The Lessons Learned from Preventing Sabotage at the Pangjiabu Mine Should Be Remembered Throughout the Country
　　Our Correspondent in Xuanhua  Li Yi
    Following the publication of the article "Important Equipment at the Longyan Iron Mine's Pangjiabu Mine Continues to Suffer Sabotage" in this newspaper, and after the supervision of the North China People's Government and the Chahar People's Government, and with the united efforts of all Party, government, military, and civilians in Xuanhua City, Xuanhua County, and Longguan County under the Chahar Southern District, the serious sabotage of the Pangjiabu Mine by illegal residents and bandit-spy elements, which had lasted for a full year, has been stopped.
    The Pangjiabu Mine stores nearly 200 million tons of iron ore, accounting for about one-tenth of the total proven iron ore reserves in China. The iron ore generally contains 62 percent iron. Such rich ore is rare in China. During the Japanese imperialist occupation, in order to utilize the iron ore, all equipment from iron ore mining to transportation was electrified and mechanized. The daily output once reached a maximum of 6,000 tons, employing more than 25,000 workers. Most of the iron ore was shipped to Japan through Tanggu and Qinhuangdao for use in the Yawata Iron & Steel Works.
    The Pangjiabu Mine was liberated in August of last year. However, the sabotage did not end with liberation. Serious sabotage continued until June of this year. It reached the point where, after large numbers of electric motors of hundreds of horsepower had their wire packs and copper axles stolen, many bad elements dared to climb up to steel frames five or six zhang high in broad daylight and cut off the 77,000-volt high-voltage lines (according to comrades from the North China Electric Power Company: this type of 2.0 seven-strand copper transmission line is now in short supply in North China, and it is not easy to purchase it from abroad). They even dismantled the angle iron from the substations to make iron tiles for carts. According to reliable statistics, about half of the 77,000-volt high triangular iron frames of the mine, which were largely intact at the time of liberation, have now been stolen (amounting to more than 20 tons). There were a total of six high-voltage transmission lines, 22 kilometers in length. Taking a single line as a unit, there were about 140,000 meters in total, apart from a small amount damaged at the time of liberation. By the end of June, less than 50,000 meters remained after the theft. Recently, when the North China Electric Power Company sent workers to convert the three transmission lines to 33,000 volts, even three lines were not enough. The situation with the electric motors was even worse. Not to mention distant events, in mid-June, the two 150-horsepower converter machines used for the original mine electric vehicles were dismantled by bad elements, leaving only two empty shells.
    Our political power work comrades and Communist Party members, who run around all day long for the people's cause, working hard and maintaining a style of hard struggle, are good. However, some comrades have a major shortcoming, namely: a lack of industrial construction thinking and a long-term overall perspective.
    When the personnel guarding the Pangjiabu Mine handed over the captured saboteurs to the local Longguan County District Office or County Government, the comrades in the District Office or County Government were often so paralyzed and perfunctory: "It's nothing for these people to get some steel to exchange for grain." Under such a wrong concept, the saboteurs who were sent in were released after a few days in custody. Some bad elements had been caught and detained several times. Some political power workers were anesthetized by an extremely reactionary rumor: "The People's Government is still good. We have nothing to eat, so we get some copper and iron from the mine to exchange for food. Isn't this saving us?"
    Some say this is a one-sided mass viewpoint. In fact, it is a viewpoint that encourages mass destruction and is harmful to the people's cause. As a result, the important equipment of the mine was smashed into scrap copper and iron and sold, and the mine was destroyed. Residents near the mining area lost the opportunity to work, and the country lost a large amount of industrial equipment.
    In Xuanhua County and Xuanhua City, a small number of government and Party workers were indifferent to such serious acts of sabotage. The Xuanhua Municipal Government arrested several female and male merchants from Beiping who colluded with bad elements to purchase high-voltage lines, but instead of severely dealing with them, they bought the high-voltage lines, gave them some money, and released these merchants who were actually encouraging the sabotage of the mine. Cadres of the Xuanhua Municipal Government reflected that they were misled by the pleas of these merchants (no travel expenses to return to Beiping). Thus, they developed a "feeling of compassion" and completely forgot that the large-scale purchase of high-voltage lines and machine parts by some unscrupulous merchants from Tianjin and Beiping actually greatly encouraged the sabotage of the mine by bad elements.
    In Xuanhua County and Xuanhua City, serious acts of knowing the law and breaking it occurred among a small number of responsible cadres. In March of this year, Zhao Ke, the secretary of the Seventh District Committee of the CCP in Xuanhua County, mobilized the masses to cut down high-voltage lines and decompose them into seven strands for use in setting up telephone lines. Chen Fushun, the head of the Third District Public Security Police Station of Xuanhua City, colluded with unscrupulous merchants to purchase high-voltage lines, transport them to Beiping via the Ping-Sui Railway, and sell them, calling it "engaging in production and sales." Yao Ziming, the head of the Industry and Commerce Section of the Xuanhua Municipal Government, turned a deaf ear to the three orders from the Chahar Provincial People's Government to stop the sabotage of the Pangjiabu Mine. He arbitrarily wrote certificates for five unscrupulous merchants to purchase large quantities of high-voltage lines and machine parts in the mining area. When the Xuanhua Branch of the Chahar Provincial Trading Company stopped purchasing so-called "scrap copper and iron" from the mine near the mining area, he repeatedly begged the Longyan Iron Mine to purchase the high-voltage lines sold by these unscrupulous merchants. This kind of thinking and behavior, which actually connived at and encouraged the sabotage of the mine, should be severely criticized and punished.
    On July 29 and 30, the Chahar Southern District CCP Committee and the Commissioner's Office held a meeting specifically to review the responsibility for the sabotage of Pangjiabu, and to ideologically liquidate the erroneous concept of not caring about the property of the people and the motherland.
    They believed that the reason why the sabotage of such an important mine as Pangjiabu did not stop after liberation in August of last year was that they had failed to first educate and transform the thinking of cadres and the masses with great efforts, so that they would realize that today the mine belongs to the people themselves. The District Committee and the Commissioner's Office themselves had a rural construction perspective, but no clear industrial construction concept. They turned a blind eye to the instructions of the Party and higher levels on industrial construction. Some people even thought that "most of our area is rural, and the few county towns are also ruralized." Therefore, they felt that there was no industrial construction to speak of. Comrade Zhao Zhenzong, secretary of the District Committee, said that their scope of responsibilities for industrial and mining construction was vague. At the beginning of the liberation of the Ping-Sui East Line, they only said to the cadres: "We must cherish public buildings, cherish state property, and strictly prohibit destruction." But there were no specific arrangements. They even thought that "there must be someone in charge of the mining area, or it is being restored and rebuilt." Comrade Zhao Zhenzong's words illustrate a very important issue, which is that as our country gradually shifts from war to peaceful construction, from being mainly rural to being mainly urban, and from cities leading the countryside, such important policy changes must first be understood by cadres and the masses. This transformation is a difficult struggle process and will not be resolved overnight. The Party and government leading organs of the Chahar Southern District have neglected this point.
    The Longyan Iron Mine also has many shortcomings in managing the Pangjiabu Mine. Xuanhua was liberated in late December of last year, but people were not sent to check it out until February of this year. At that time, the responsible comrades of the mine mistakenly believed that "the Pangjiabu Mine has been destroyed (referring to the first liberation), and restoration has become impossible." Therefore, people were not sent to guard it until March. This inadvertently gave the saboteurs an opportunity to take advantage of. Later, they failed to actively contact the local county government and the special district commissioner's office to put forward effective measures to stop the sabotage.
    After the Pangjiabu Mine was liberated, it was continuously sabotaged by illegal elements for a year. From March to June of this year, the Chahar Provincial People's Government ordered the Xuanhua and Longguan County Governments to stop the sabotage three times, but it did not conduct a single on-site inspection. The Chahar Provincial Committee of the CCP also did not carry out specific organizational work within the Party. The Chahar Southern District Commissioner's Office received the provincial government's order to stop the sabotage three times, and Commissioner Guo Yun also received a letter from Chairman Zhang Su of the provincial government regarding the prevention of sabotage. At that time, due to the lack of a clear industrial construction viewpoint in ideology, they were treated with indifference, and only "submitted to the Industry and Commerce Section for record" was written on the provincial government's order. Commissioner Guo Yun said in his reflection: "Since the damage is so serious (referring to the situation reported by the Zhangxuan Enterprise Takeover Group in the provincial government's order), what else can be damaged?" This made the leading organs of the Chahar Southern District not discuss the issue of how to stop the sabotage with the Party committee once before this newspaper published the news "Important equipment at the Pangjiabu Mine is constantly being sabotaged."
    In several orders, the Chahar Provincial People's Government requested the counties to "investigate and report." However, to this day, the district and counties have not made a single report.
    With the strict orders of the North China People's Government and the Chahar Provincial People's Government, the sabotage of the Pangjiabu Mine by bad elements has been temporarily stopped, which is good. But we must never think that everything is fine. We should be very clear that these saboteurs, unable to withstand the punishment of the people, have now disappeared. But some of them have not been found and arrested. One day, they will take advantage of the gaps in our work, especially the bureaucracy and ideological paralysis in our work, to carry out sabotage again. We can no longer be paralyzed, and the lessons of the past year are enough. Finally, we suggest: 1. Use the greatest strength, using various methods, to educate cadres and the masses, thoroughly liquidate the various muddled concepts of industrial construction in the past, and educate and transform the small number of cadres who know the law and break it. Mobilize the masses to expose saboteurs and give severe sanctions to the main elements. 2. Quickly and universally establish mine protection organizations near the mining area. Strengthen the defense forces of the mine itself. Cooperating with the rear defense forces of the local military region, the defense of industrial and mining transportation should be regarded as one of the important tasks. 3. The government explicitly prohibits the purchase of copper and iron in industrial and mining areas.

　　庞家堡矿场已制止破坏经验教训值得各地记取
    本报驻宣化记者  李翼
    本报发表“龙烟铁矿庞家堡矿场重要设备不断遭受破坏”的消息后，经过华北人民政府、察哈尔人民政府的督导，和察南分区所属宣化市、宣化县、龙关县全体党政军民的齐心协力，已经把不法居民及匪特分子加于庞家堡矿场为时整整一年的严重破坏行为制止了。
    庞家堡矿场储藏铁砂近两亿吨，约占我国已查明之铁砂总储藏量的十分之一。铁砂一般含铁量在百分之六十二。象这样的富矿，在中国并不多见。日本帝国主义侵据期间，为了利用该矿的铁砂，从铁砂的采掘到运输，全部用电气化、机械化的设备，日产最高量曾达六千吨，使用工人二万五千余名。铁砂的大部经塘沽、秦皇岛运往日本，供八番制钢制铁所使用。
    庞家堡矿场是在去年八月间重获解放的。可是，被破坏的事件却没有随着解放而告终结。严重的破坏一直继续到今年六月。竟闹到这样的地步：在大批的上百马力的电动机，被盗走线包、铜轴心之后，不少坏分子竟敢白昼上到高达五、六丈的钢架上去，卡断过去输送七万七千伏特的高压线（据华北电业公司的同志们说：这一种二点零的七股紫铜输电线，今天在华北储存既少，国外运购亦非易事）。甚至拆下变电所的三角铁去做大车上的铁瓦。据可靠统计，矿场七万七千伏特之高大三角铁架，刚解放时大体完整，今已有二分之一被盗走（数约廿余吨）。高压输电线共六根，全长廿二公里。以单根计，刚解放时除少量被破坏者外，共约有十四万余米。到六月底止，被盗走后余下的已不及五万米。最近由华北电业公司派工改做三万三千伏特之三根输电线时，连三根也不够了。电动机情况更惨。远的不去说，六月中旬，原矿山电车用两部一百五十马力的变流机，被坏分子拆得仅余两个空壳。
    我们的政权工作同志和共产党党员，他们镇日为人民的事业而东奔西跑，努力工作，依然保持着艰苦奋斗的作风，这是好的。但是，有些同志有一个很大的缺点，即：缺乏建设工业的思想和远大的整体观念。
    当守卫庞家堡矿场的人员将捉住的破坏分子送交当地的龙关县区公所或县政府时，区公所或县政府的工作同志常常是这样的麻痹，了草从事：“这些人弄点钢铁换点粮食不算什么”。在这样一种错误观念下，被送去的破坏分子，押几天就放了。有的坏分子一直被捉、押了好几次。有些政权工作人员，被一种极端反动的流言麻醉了自己：“还是人民的政府好。我们没有吃的，从矿上弄点铜铁换点吃的，这不是救了我们了吗？”
    有人说这是片面的群众观点。其实，这是一种鼓励群众破坏的观点，是对人民事业有百害而无一利。于是，矿山的重要设备被砸成碎铜烂铁卖了，矿山毁灭了。矿区附近的居民失掉了作工的机会，国家失掉了庞大的工业设备。
    在宣化县和宣化市，少数政府和党的工作人员，对于这样严重的破坏事件漠然处之。宣化市政府捉了北平来的几个勾结坏分子收卖高压线的女商人和男商人，不但不严加处理，反而将高压线收买下，给几个钱，将这些实际上鼓励破坏矿山的商人放走。宣化市政府的干部反省说：当时他们为这些商人的哀求（回北平没路费）所迷惑住了。于是他们便产生了“恻隐之心”，而完全忘记了由于平津某些奸商的来宣化大量收购高压线、机器零件等，实际上大大鼓励了坏分子对矿山的破坏。
    在宣化县和宣化市，发生了严重的少数相当负责的干部的知法犯法行为。今年三月间宣化县七区中共区委书记赵克为了架设电话线，竟动员群众割下高压线，将之分解成七股使用。宣化市第三区公安派出所长陈福顺，勾结奸商，收购高压线，经平绥路运北平出卖，名之为“搞生产搞运销”。宣化市政府工商科长姚子明，对察哈尔省人民政府三次制止破坏庞家堡矿山的命令置若罔闻。他擅自给五个奸商书写证明文件，到矿区大量收购高压线及机器零件。当察哈尔省贸易公司宣化分公司停止在矿区附近收购矿山所谓“碎铜烂铁”时，他又好几次的将这些奸商贩来的高压线死求百赖的要龙烟铁矿收购。这种实际上是纵容、鼓励破坏矿山的思想行为，应该受到严重的批评和处分。
    七月二十九、三十两日，察南中共地委和专员公署，召开了一个会议，专门检讨对庞家堡破坏应负的责任，并从思想上清算了对于人民祖国财产不关心的错误观念。
    他们认为，象庞家堡这样重要的矿山，去年八月解放后未曾停止破坏的原因，是在于他们首先未能以大力教育和转变干部和群众思想，使之认识到今天矿山业已属于人民自己。地委和专署本身有农村建设观点，却无明确的工业建设观念。对于党和上级关于工业建设的指示，熟视无睹。有的人甚至于以为“我们的地区大部是农村，个把子县城也是农村化了的。”所以自觉得无工业建设可言。地委书记赵振宗同志说，他们对工矿建设的职责范围是模糊的。在平绥东线重获解放之初，只是对干部这样说过：“要爱护公共建筑，爱护国家财产，严禁破坏。”但却毫无具体布置。甚至认为“矿区一定有专人负责，或者正在恢复重建之中。”赵振宗同志的话，说明了一个极重要的问题，这就是：当着我们的国家逐步由战争转入和平建设，由以农村为主变为以城市为主，以城市领导乡村的今天，象这样重要的政策上的变化，首先必须求得干部和群众的了解，这种转变是艰苦的斗争过程，绝不是一个早上就解决了的。而察南分区党政领导机关，正是忽略了这一点。
    龙烟铁矿在管理庞家堡矿山上，亦有不少缺点。去年十二月底宣化即重获解放，但迟至本年二月间，始派人前去查看。当时矿方负责同志，错误的以为“庞家堡矿场既已破坏（指第一次解放后），恢复已成不可能”。因此迟至三月间始派人前往看守。这无形中给了破坏分子以可乘的机会。以后又未能主动的去和当地县政府和专区公署取得联系，积极的提出有效的制止办法。
    庞家堡矿山重获解放后，遭不法分子连续破坏达一年之久。察哈尔省人民政府从本年三月至六月，曾三次命令宣化、龙关县政府制止破坏，但未进行过一次实地的检查。中共察哈尔省委也没有从党内进行过具体的组织工作。察南专员公署曾三次接到省政府制止破坏的命令，专员郭韫亦曾接到过省府张苏主席一封谈及制止破坏的便函。当时因在思想上缺乏明确的工业建设观点，故均待之以漠然态度，在省府的命令上只批以“交工商科存查”。郭韫专员反省时说：“既已破坏如此（指省府命令中根据张宣企业接管组所呈报的情况）严重，那还有什么可破坏的呢？”这样就使着察南分区的领导机关，在本报发表“庞家堡矿场重要设备遭不断破坏”消息以前，关于如何制止破坏问题，从没有与党委研究过一次。
    察哈尔省人民政府在几次命令中，曾提出要各县“查明具报”。可是时至今日，分区和县却连一次报告也没有做过。
    经过华北人民政府、察哈尔省人民政府的严令制止，已暂时将坏分子对于庞家堡矿场的破坏停止了，这是好的。但我们绝不能以为万事已大吉。我们应该十分清楚的知道，这些破坏分子，经不起人民的讨罚，现已消声匿迹。但他们其中一些人还没有被查获，被逮捕。有朝一日，他们还会趁我们工作中的空隙，特别是利用我们工作中的官僚主义以及思想上的麻痹来再行破坏的。我们不能再麻痹，一年来的教训够多了。最后我们建议：一、用最大的力量，利用各种方式，教育干部和群众，彻底清算以往对工业建设的种种糊涂观念，教育改造知法犯法的少数干部。发动群众检举破坏分子，并给予主要分子以严厉制裁。二、在矿区附近迅速普遍的建立护矿组织。加强矿山本身的守卫力量。配合地方军区的后方守备部队，将工矿交通之守备，作为重要任务之一。三、政府明令禁止在工矿区收购铜、铁。
