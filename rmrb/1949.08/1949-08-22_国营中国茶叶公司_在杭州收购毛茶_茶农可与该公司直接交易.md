    [Hangzhou News] In order to develop foreign trade business, crush enemy blockades, be self-reliant and find its own way out, and achieve economic prosperity through the normal development of industry and commerce, the China Tea Company of the Foreign Trade Bureau of East China is actively carrying out work to promote tea production. Recently, the company sent a special representative to Hangzhou to establish a resident office. The staff began working on the 13th, and began purchasing maocha on the 15th. According to the person in charge of the company: This purchase of a portion of maocha in Hangzhou is purely from the perspective of the interests of the tea farmers themselves, serving the working tea farmers. In order to eliminate exploitation by tea merchants, it is hoped that the tea farmers can automatically organize themselves, send representatives, prepare samples, and come to Hangzhou to directly contact the company. All transportation and related difficulties can be discussed as much as possible, and the company will assist in solving them as much as possible, seeking solutions together.
    The company's maocha purchase procedure is extremely simple. First, the owner submits sample packages, explains the source of the tea, and after numbering, the price is evaluated. Then, the sample is weighed, put into the warehouse, and the payment is settled. The procedure is then completed.
