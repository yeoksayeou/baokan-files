    Beiping Military Control Commission People's Government Decides
    to Convene Representatives from All Walks of Life
    to Solicit Opinions and Promote the Construction of New Beiping
    Total Number of Representatives Set at 302
    [Beiping News] The Beiping Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Beiping Municipal People's Government, in order to strengthen ties with the people, broadly solicit opinions from all walks of life, and more effectively promote the various constructions of a people's democratic New Beiping, have decided to convene the Beiping Municipal People's Representative Conference on August 9th. Prior to this, all important measures in the city were implemented only after convening representatives from relevant parties to hold discussions and reach unanimous solutions before implementation. These symposiums had the nature of representative conferences from all walks of life, but formally convening a representative conference is now not only necessary, but also fully mature. Regarding the allocation of representative quotas and the method of selection for this representative conference, opinions were exchanged with various parties and groups in advance, and it was decided that the total number of representatives would be 302, including representatives from the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Beiping Branch of the China Democratic League, the Reorganization Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the September 3rd Society, the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, and other municipal-level organizations of various parties; representatives from the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Farmers' Association, Youth Federation, Women's Federation, Student Federation, Middle and Primary School Teachers' Federation, College and University Teachers' Federation, Medical Workers' Association, and other groups and cooperatives; representatives from the Garrison Troops and staff of various agencies stationed in Beiping; representatives of ethnic minorities; representatives from industry and commerce and peddlers; representatives from the press, literary and art circles, and other circles; experts, scholars, and representatives of other patriotic democratic figures. The method of selecting representatives is divided into two types: those with organizations are recommended by their respective organizations according to the prescribed number of places; those who cannot be recommended are appointed by the government. The Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government have jointly sent letters to various parties, groups, military units, and agencies, requesting them to select representatives according to the prescribed number of places (to be announced separately) and notify the Military Control Commission of the candidates before the evening of the 7th. Other representatives will be appointed by letter today and tomorrow. This conference will hear reports from the Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government on the work situation and administrative policies and guidelines over the past six months, which will be discussed by the representatives. It is expected that this conference will further strengthen the ties between the government and the people, fully exchange opinions from all sides, and enable the Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government's administrative policies, guidelines, and specific work arrangements to be concentrated on a democratic basis, more deeply implemented among the masses, and further advance the construction of the people's New Beiping.

    【平市讯】中国人民解放军北平市军事管制委员会及北平市人民政府，为了加强与人民群众的联系，广泛征求各界意见，以便更有力的推进人民民主的新北平的各项建设，特决定于八月九日召开北平市各界代表会议。在此以前，本市各项重要措施，均于实行之前分别召集有关方面之代表人物举行座谈，商讨一致的办法，然后实行。这些座谈会均带有各界代表会议的性质，但正式召开各界代表会议现在不仅是十分必要，而且条件亦已完全成熟。关于此次代表会议代表名额分配及产生方法，事先曾与各党派团体交换意见，决定代表总名额为三百零二人，内包括中国共产党北平市委员会、中国国民党革命委员会北平市分会筹委会、中国民主同盟北平市支部、中国农工民主党北平市整理委员会、九三学社、中国新民主主义青年团北平市筹委会等各党派市级组织代表；北平市工会、农会、青联、妇联、学联、中小学教职联、院校教职联、医务工作者协会等各团体及合作社代表；卫戍部队及驻平各机关工作人员代表；少数民族代表；工商业界及摊贩代表；新闻界、文艺界及其他各界代表；专家、学者及其他爱国民主人士之代表人物等。代表产生方法分为两种：凡有组织者由各该组织按规定名额推选；凡不能推选者由政府聘请之。军管会及市政府昨已联衔函请各党派团体部队机关依照规定名额（另行公布），选派代表，于七日晚以前，将代表人选通知军管会。其他代表则将于今明日函聘。此次会议将听取军管会及市政府关于半年来工作情况及施政方针、政策等报告，并由代表会议加以讨论。预料此次会议必能使政府与人民的联系更加密切，充分交换各方面之意见，使军管会及市政府的施政方针、政策及具体工作布置更能在民主的基础上集中起来，更能深入贯彻到群众中去，使人民的新北平的建设工作更加前进一步。
