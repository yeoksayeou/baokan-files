To the Editor:
　　My child is mentally ill. Please answer in your newspaper, how many mental hospitals are there in Peiping? Where are they located? Are they public or private?

　　　　Chai Wenzeng

Mr. Chai Wenzeng:
　　There are two mental hospitals in the city: one is the Municipal Mental Hospital, located in Gaogong'an. However, due to the small size of the hospital, it is temporarily unable to accept new patients. It will expand and accommodate more patients after a suitable location is found. The other is the private Xiehua Mental Sanatorium, located in Cuihua Hutong, East City.

    本市疯人医院有二处：一为市立精神病院，地址在高公庵。惟因院址狭小，暂时不能收留新病人，俟觅得适当地址后，再行扩充收容。一为私立协华精神病疗养院，地址在东城翠花胡同。　　—编者
