Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 18th. In order to reduce the people's burden and overcome current financial difficulties, the Shandong Provincial People's Government issued ten prohibitions on August 15. The contents are as follows: 1. It is forbidden to freely expand the establishment. Agencies are not allowed to increase personnel at will, and schools are not allowed to expand the number of publicly funded students at will. Before the establishment is determined, reductions are allowed, but increases are not allowed. In special cases, approval from the provincial government must be obtained first. After the establishment is determined, it must be resolutely reorganized according to the establishment and must not be changed without the approval of the provincial government. 2. It is forbidden to waste public property, and thrift is encouraged. Public property stored by various units should be reported to the higher authorities for review and registration after inventory. It must not be used or sold without the approval of the higher authorities. All funds and materials should be subject to unified management and dispatch, and opposition to decentralization, independence, and doing things their own way. 3. It is forbidden to engage in large-scale construction. All agency houses should maintain their current status for the time being, and no random decoration, new construction, or rental and purchase of real estate is allowed. If dilapidated houses really need to be repaired to avoid greater damage, the person in charge of the competent department must conduct a strict inspection and report to the higher authorities for approval before construction can begin; "acting first and reporting later" is not allowed. 4. It is forbidden to abuse furniture, add equipment, and use cars at will in violation of regulations, wasting gasoline. It is encouraged to cherish public property and not to compare or be extravagant. Urban agencies must strictly conserve water and electricity and cancel the use of horses. 5. It is forbidden to eat and drink extravagantly and give gifts. It is advocated to be thrifty and save expenses. The treatment of all staff and the reception of visitors should be handled in accordance with the system, and no extra expenses should be incurred. Winter clothing should be issued as much as possible with old clothes to save new clothes. 6. It is forbidden to hold gatherings, watch dramas, present flags, solicit donations, or offer condolences, etc., at will, and to oppose extravagance and waste. 7. It is forbidden for agencies and schools to engage in trade and production, and it is forbidden to rush to purchase and hoard materials, disrupting the market. And it is not allowed to arbitrarily squander profits from production. 8. It is forbidden to falsely report the number of people and receive excessive public grain, public grass, and public property. The surplus portion of the public payment must be handed over to the public on time and must not be retained for private use. 9. It is forbidden to freely expand the army and dispatch labor. It is forbidden to mobilize to join the army without the approval of the provincial government and military region. Without the approval of governments above the county level, it is forbidden to use civilian labor at will. 10. It is forbidden to apportion at will and requisition people's property at will, increasing the people's extra burden.

It is reported that this year's disaster situation in Shandong is relatively serious. Recently, continuous rain has caused waterlogging in 1.4 million mu of land in 19 counties of the Bohai Administrative Office. Water disasters have also occurred in areas such as Taierzhuang, Zaozhuang, and the coastal areas. In addition, some areas have suffered from drought, insects, and wind disasters. It is already a certainty that the autumn harvest will be reduced this year, causing serious financial difficulties in supporting the front line and newly liberated areas, as well as in developing production. The purpose of the provincial government's issuance of the ten prohibitions is to practice thrift, eliminate waste, and reduce financial difficulties. After the promulgation of the prohibitions, the provincial government has taken the lead, held meetings, and specifically discussed implementation methods to launch a streamlining and austerity campaign. The small and medium-sized stoves in the provincial government have been canceled, and Vice Chairman Guo Zihua and the heads of various departments have all switched to eating in the communal dining hall. The provincial government has stipulated that, except for guests from the Shandong Liberated Area, all tea and cigarette receptions will be stopped; it has also stipulated measures to save office paper, water, and electricity.
