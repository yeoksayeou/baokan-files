　　Don't Be Greedy When Learning Culture
  　Changxindian Work Group Learns a Lesson
  　Starts with the Most Needed Subjects
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Zhangguozhuang Work Group in Changxindian District, according to the study plan for on-the-job cadres issued by the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, formed groups for study. The comrades leading the cultural studies were very diligent, arranging a large number of subjects. Nature, geography, history, Chinese language, arithmetic, Party lessons, current events, and policies—everything was included. At the beginning of the study, the comrades all prepared study notebooks and studied with great enthusiasm and concentration. After studying for a few days, everyone felt that they were trying to swallow more than they could chew and couldn't absorb it. The comrades raised their opinions. Comrade Tan Huaicai said: We shouldn't be greedy when learning; we should focus on remembering things. Other comrades also believed that they should start with memorizing new characters and learning geography and arithmetic. Comrade Sun Fulin said: Our advancing People's Liberation Army has liberated so many places, and we don't even know which province they're in. Comrade Gao Yi said: In the future, we will be doing economic construction work, and if we can't even do basic accounting, how will that work? Based on everyone's opinions, the study group formulated a new plan, starting with the most urgently needed subjects: Chinese language, learning to recognize and write five new characters every two days; arithmetic, starting with addition and subtraction; geography, starting with "Beijing City," "Hebei Province," and "North China." After discussion and approval by everyone, the enthusiasm for learning increased again. In addition to the normal study time, comrades sat under the trees writing new characters and doing calculations whenever they had free time from work.

　　学文化别贪多
  　长辛店工作组接受教训
  　先从最需要的课目学起
    【本报讯】长辛店区张郭庄工作组，根据市委宣传部发出的在职干部学习计划，分组学习。领导文化学习的同志，抓得很紧，布置了一大批课目。自然、地理、历史、国语、算术、党课、时事，政策，样样俱全。在开始学习的时候，同志们都准备了学习笔记本，兴高彩烈，聚精会神的学习。学了几天之后，大家感到贪多嚼不烂，接受不了。同志们提出了意见。谭怀才同志说：我们学习不要贪多，要求记下。别的同志也认为应从记生字与地理、算术学起。孙福林同志说：我们前进的解放军解放的地方那么多，我们都不知道在那一省。高义同志说：今后我们要作经济建设工作，连帐都算不好，还行？根据大家的意见，学习小组拟定了新的计划，从最迫切需要的课目开始，国语，每两天要认识和会写五个生字；算术，从加减开始；地理，由“北平市”、“河北省”、“华北”学起。经大家讨论通过后，学习情绪又提高了，同志们除了在正常的学习时间外，工作如有闲暇，都坐在树荫下写着生字，划着数码。
