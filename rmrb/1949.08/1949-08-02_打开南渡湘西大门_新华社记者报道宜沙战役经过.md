Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 1st dispatch. A frontline reporter reports on the Yisha campaign's progress, stating: The People's Liberation Army (PLA) on the western Hubei front, from July 13th to 16th, with rapid advance, liberated Jiangling, Shashi, and Yichang, crossed the Yangtze River, and opened the door to the southern crossing and western Hunan. This is the glorious and victorious first act undertaken by the western contingent of the PLA on the Yangtze River front in its advance into South China. Bandit chieftain Song Xilian had recently boasted about his so-called "Shashi, Yichang, and Jiangbei base," and attempted to reoccupy the Shashi-Xiangyang highway to block our army's crossing of the river. However, in just three days, the PLA liberated Yichang, Shashi, and the vast Jiangbei region, and crossed the Yangtze River from a front spanning hundreds of miles, entering southern Hubei and western Hunan.

This advance into southern Hubei and western Hunan was carried out under difficult conditions of intense heat and widespread marshland. During the nights of July 12th and 13th, the PLA advanced amidst fierce wind and rain, making it impossible for people to raise their heads and horses to open their eyes. Soldiers went without sufficient food for three to four days and camped on the grass. However, in the face of the loyal and courageous people's army, there were no insurmountable obstacles. Commanders and fighters displayed a high degree of class comradeship and a strong fighting spirit. Unable to see the road, they held hands and walked forward. Amidst the roar of the wind and rain, the resolute voices of the heroic soldiers could be heard: "Move on! To fight the enemy!" The people's artillery, which had demonstrated its might on the Northeast and North China battlefields, faced even greater hardships. They carried the giant cannons step by step out of the muddy marshes. Just one look at the deeply sunken mud would make you realize that this was simply an unbelievable miracle.

On the 13th, combat missions were transmitted from the front-line headquarters. At dawn, the commanders issued a resounding call: "Open up Jingzhou and Shashi, open up the gateway to cross the river!" The vanguard troops had already crossed the river and were heading west, and the follow-up troops immediately advanced south. The PLA troops advancing towards Jingzhou and Shashi pushed forward bravely. The stubborn enemy attempted to destroy the bridges, but the bandits did not even have time to act before they were seized by the PLA. A certain division suddenly moved between Jingzhou and Shashi, cutting off the enemy's escape route to Shashi. "Strive to win the first victory in the southward advance!" At this time, combat enthusiasm burned like fire. As soon as a gunshot was heard in front, those who could not walk still struggled to rush forward. Shashi was placed under the offensive firepower of our army. As soon as the enemy was discovered to be fleeing, another PLA unit immediately entered Shashi from the southwest, using artillery fire to block the turbulent river surface. Enemy ships that escaped into the river were hit by our artillerymen, two were damaged, and one was sunk. By 12:00 PM, after only two hours of fighting, the enemy in Shashi was completely annihilated. Another PLA unit liberated Jingzhou at the same time. On the morning of the 16th, the PLA advancing from the west route, in one fell swoop, occupied Yichang, an important commercial port on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, annihilating thousands of enemies. "Opening up Yichang and Shashi means opening up the gateway to cross the river." Millions of PLA soldiers surged across the Yangtze through this gap between Yichang and Shashi to take Changsha.

    打开南渡湘西大门
    新华社记者报道宜沙战役经过
    【新华社华中前线一日电】前线记者报道宜、沙战役的经过称：鄂西前线人民解放军，从七月十三日至十六日，以急风骤雨式地进军，解放江陵、沙市、宜昌，横渡长江，打开了南渡湘西的大门。这是长江前线解放军西线部队，在进军华南中，所展开的光辉胜利的第一幕。匪首宋希濂在不久以前还吹嘘他的什么“沙、宜、江北根据地”。并妄图重占沙、襄公路阻挡我军过江。但仅仅三天功夫，解放军就解放宜、沙和江北广大地区，并从几百里的防线上渡过长江，进入鄂南和湘西地区。
    这次向鄂南和湘西进军，是在炎暑酷热及遍地湖沼的困难条件下进行的。七月十二日和十三日的夜间，在猛烈的风雨中前进的解放军，人仰不起头，马张不开眼。战士们三四天吃不饱饭，还在草地上露营。但在忠诚与勇敢的人民军队面前，是没有克服不了的障碍的。指战员们发扬了高度的阶级友爱和坚强的战斗精神，看不见路，就拉着手走，在狂风暴雨的轰响下，是英勇的战士们坚毅的声音：“走呀！打敌人去呀！”在东北华北战场上显过神威的人民炮兵，更为艰苦，他们从泥泞湖沼中一步一步地把巨型大炮抬过来。只要看一看那深陷的泥沼，便会觉得这简直是谁也不敢相信的奇迹。
    十三日战斗任务从前线指挥部传来了，在黎明中指挥员发出了响亮的号召：“打开荆、沙，打开过江门户！”前头部队已经渡河西行，后续部队立刻朝南猛进。向荆、沙前进的一路解放军，勇猛向前推进。阻险的敌人企图将桥梁毁坏，但匪徒们还没有来得及下手，就被解放军夺过来了。某师一下子转到荆、沙之间，断绝了敌人向沙市逃走的道路，“争取打南下第一个胜仗呀！”这时战斗热情象火一样地燃烧，前面枪一响，后面走不动路的也拚命往上扑。沙市被置于我军攻势火力之下。前头刚一发现敌人要跑，另路解放军立刻就从西南面进沙市，用炮火封锁住波涛滚滚的江面。逃到江心的敌船，被我们炮手击伤两只，击沉一只。到晚十二时，仅经过两小时的战斗，就彻底消灭了沙市的敌人。另路解放军在同时解放了荆州。十六日晨，由西路前进的解放军，一举攻占了长江上游重要商埠宜昌，歼敌数千人。“打开了宜沙，就是打开了过江的门户”。千百万的解放军，就从宜、沙之间这一段缺口，汹涌渡过长沙了。
