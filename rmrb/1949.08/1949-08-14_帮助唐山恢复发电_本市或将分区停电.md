    Helping Tangshan Restore Power Generation
    The City May Experience Zonal Blackouts
    [Our Newspaper] Due to the recent flooding in Tangshan, the Tangshan Branch Power Plant of the North China Electric Power Company suffered a flood disaster and was forced to shut down. Now that the floodwaters have receded, the Tangshan Power Plant is working to restore power generation, requiring more than 2,000 kilowatts of electricity per day for drying and inspecting various power generation equipment. Under the current circumstances, this power requirement can only be supplied by Beiping. Furthermore, the Shijingshan Power Plant must overhaul its No. 17 gas furnace without further delay. Therefore, the city of Beiping may experience zonal blackouts in the near future.
    Further news: If power outages are necessary in the coming days, the blackout areas will be divided into four groups: Group 1: Xidan Road, Di’anmen, Dengshikou, Xisi Road, Beixinqiao, East Suburb Road. Group 2: Guangqumen, Nanchang Street, Nanxi Road, Dongdan Road, Fuchengmen, Nanchi Zi. Group 3: Guang’anmen, Chaoyangmen, Gouyan Road, Deshengmen, Hademen. Group 4: Nanzhong Road, Yongdingmen, Andingmen, Xizhimen, Yonghe Temple, Nandong Road. In addition, Dongzhimen Road, the Railway Special Line, and Fuyou Street Road are not included due to the need to maintain electricity for water and electricity, railway signals, and radio stations.

    帮助唐山恢复发电
    本市或将分区停电
    【本报讯】此次唐山涨水，华北电业公司唐山分公司发电所遭受水灾，陷于停电。现水势已退，唐山发电所正从事恢复发电工作，每日约须用电二千千瓦以上，作为干燥及检查各项发电设备之用。是项需要电源，在目前情况下，只能由北平供给。又因石景山发电所必须检修十七号煤气炉，无法再延，故平市最近或有分区停电可能。
    又讯：日内如必须停电时，停电区域将分四组，第一组：西单路、地安门、灯市口、西四路、北新桥、东郊路。第二组：广渠门、南长街、南西路、东单路、阜成门、南池子。第三组：广安门、朝阳门、沟沿路、德胜门、哈德门。第四组：南中路、永定门、安定门、西直门、雍和宫、南东路。此外东直门路、车站专线及府右街路因维持水电、铁路号志及广播电台用电，未列入。
