　　Railway Ministry Employees Maintain Revolutionary Order
  　Report Reactionary Elements
    Forty-Six Have Already Registered Voluntarily
    [This City News] Since the Railway Ministry of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission began the work of registering reactionary elements, from August 4th to 12th, forty-six people, including reactionary party and league leaders above the district level and special agents, have voluntarily registered. These include two members of the Railway Special Party Department, six members of the District Party Department, four leaders of the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth Corps at the district level, and sixteen special agents from the Secrecy Bureau, the Party Statistics Bureau, and the Second Department of the bogus Ministry of National Defense. They also handed over twenty-six organizational and reactionary documents. When the work began, the heads of various bureaus, departments, and directly subordinate units personally took charge of leading the preparation and mobilization work. The Planning Bureau held two mobilization meetings and used methods such as group discussions and individual talks to mobilize people. At the mobilization meetings, the dishonest attitude of many reactionary party and league members was first exposed, and their ideological concerns, such as fear of not being leniently treated, fear of being trained, fear of the impact on their positions, and fear of speaking out now about what they didn't say in the past, were dispelled. At the same time, it was emphasized that only by being consciously responsible and telling the truth could one solve one's own problems. The directly subordinate units of the ministry also used various methods to carry out propaganda, producing a total of 237 wall posters, 48 cartoons, and 47 poems and ballads, in addition to blackboard newspapers and broadcasts. The employees of each unit also enthusiastically launched reporting work, exposing more than 400 reactionary elements in eight days.
