Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation recently issued the following statement condemning the White Paper released by the U.S. State Department:

　　We, representing the broad masses of Chinese women, sternly denounce the White Paper released by the U.S. State Department on August 5th. The White Paper fully exposes the aggressive face of U.S. imperialism and demonstrates the U.S. imperialist government's irreconcilable hostility towards the powerful development of the Chinese people's democratic forces. Therefore, we must heighten our vigilance and continue to resist and guard against any U.S. imperialist conspiracy.

　　Our women compatriots, everyone still remembers the Shen Chong incident that occurred in Beiping, the collective rape incident that occurred in the Jingming Building in Hankou, and the humiliation and painful events inflicted upon Chinese women by U.S. imperialists in other parts of the country; we will also never forget the crimes of U.S. imperialism in using weapons such as airplanes, tanks, artillery, and carbines to massively slaughter our fathers, brothers, husbands, and children, leaving us displaced, orphaned, and widowed. Now, U.S.-made airplanes are still dropping bombs in the liberated areas, U.S.-made warships are still blockading our seaports, and U.S.-trained secret agents are still carrying out sabotage activities in the liberated areas. The U.S. imperialist policy of aggression against China is incompatible with the interests of the Chinese people and Chinese women. At present, due to the long-term sabotage by the imperialists and the Kuomintang and temporary natural disasters, the people's lives are encountering some difficulties. Perhaps a very small number of women cherish the U.S. aid materials of the past—flour, milk powder, canned goods. They will say, "The United States is not good, but the United States has flour for us to eat." Little do they know that these things are exchanged for the flesh and blood of the broad masses of the Chinese people and the sovereignty of our country.

　　We, the broad masses of Chinese women, do not want any aid from imperialism with sugar-coated poison. We need international friendship and assistance; however, we do not seek it from U.S. imperialism, but from the Soviet Union, the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, and all democratic forces in the world. At the same time, we must also learn from their experience in struggle and production and construction.

　　There are many difficulties facing us, but fortunately, the broad masses of Chinese women have always been diligent and hardworking. We have already overcome them in the past, and now we will certainly be able to work together with the broad masses of the Chinese people, practice diligence and thrift, and break through the material difficulties imposed upon us by the imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries.

　　We want to solemnly tell U.S. imperialism: We, the broad masses of Chinese women, together with the entire Chinese people, resolutely oppose your conspiracies. We believe that since your old conspiracies have failed, your new conspiracies are also bound to fail.

　　全国妇联发表声明
  　谴责美帝白皮书
    指出美帝新阴谋也必然要失败
    【新华社北平二十日电】中华全国民主妇女联合会顷为谴责美国国务院发表的白皮书发表声明如下：
    我们代表中国广大妇女群众，严斥美国国务院于八月五日所发表的白皮书。白皮书里充分暴露了美国帝国主义的侵略真面目，说明了美国帝国主义政府对中国人民民主力量的强大发展，怀着誓不两立的敌视态度。因此，我们必须提高警惕，继续抵抗和防备美国帝国主义的任何阴谋。
    我们妇女同胞，大家还记得在北平发生的沈崇事件，在汉口景明大楼发生的集体强奸事件，以及在全国其他各地美国帝国主义者给予中国妇女的污辱与惨痛的事迹；也永远不会忘记美国帝国主义以飞机、坦克、大炮、卡宾枪等武器，大量屠杀了我们的父兄，丈夫与儿女，使我们流离失所、孤寡无依的罪行。现在美国造的飞机还在解放区投弹，美国造的军舰还在封锁我们的海口，美国训练的特务，还在解放区进行破坏活动，美帝国主义对华的侵略政策是与中国人民中国妇女的利益不相容的。目前我国由于帝国主义国民党的长期破坏和暂时的天灾，人民生活遇到了一些困难，也许妇女中可能有极少数人眷恋着过去的美援物资——面粉、奶粉、罐头，他们会说：“美国不好，可是美国有面粉给我们吃。”殊不知这些东西正是以中国广大人民的血肉和我们国家的主权所换来的。
    我们广大的中国妇女，决不要帝国主义糖衣包毒药的什么援助。我们需要国际友谊和援助的；但，不是向美帝国主义去要，而是向苏联、向东南欧新民主主义国家和世界一切民主力量去要，同时我们还要向他们学习斗争和生产建设的经验。
    横在我们面前的困难是不少的，好在广大的中国妇女一向勤劳刻苦，过去我们都已经熬过来了，现在也一定能和广大的中国人民在一起，克勤克俭，冲破帝国主义和国民党反动派给我们的物质上的困难。
    我们要正告美国帝国主义：我们广大的中国妇女，和全中国的人民在一起，是坚决反对你们的阴谋的。我们相信，你们的旧阴谋既然失败，你们的新阴谋也必然要失败。
