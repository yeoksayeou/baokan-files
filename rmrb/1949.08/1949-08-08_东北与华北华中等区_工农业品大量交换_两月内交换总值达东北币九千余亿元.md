    Large-Scale Exchange of Industrial and Agricultural Products Between Northeast China and North and Central China
    Total Value of Exchanges Reaches Over 900 Billion Northeast Currency in Two Months
    [Northeast News] The exchange of goods between Northeast China and the liberated areas within the customs provides necessary items to each other. According to incomplete statistics, the import and export trade between Northeast China and North China, East China, and Ningbo in May and June totaled more than 900,453 million Northeast currency. The main transfer points and ports for Northeast China's exports to within the customs are Shanhaiguan, Andong, and Yingkou. According to incomplete statistics from Shanhaiguan, Andong, and Yingkou: the value of goods exported from Northeast China to within the customs in May and June was more than 652,520 million Northeast currency, and the value of goods imported from within the customs to Northeast China was 252,000 million Northeast currency; of which the import and export trade with North China accounted for more than 88% of the total trade volume. The major exports are grain, soybeans, and bean products; the major imports are yarn, cotton fabrics, and similar items. Due to the restoration of transportation and exchange of goods between Northeast China and the liberated areas within the customs, the resources lacking in Northeast China are continuously imported, so the prices of foreign goods on the market are becoming cheaper day by day.

    东北与华北华中等区
    工农业品大量交换
    两月内交换总值达东北币九千余亿元
    【东北消息】东北和关内解放区物资交流相互供应必要物品，东北和华北、华东、宁波五、六两月的出入口贸易，据不完全的统计一共达东北币九千零四十五万万三千多万元。东北向关内输出的转运地和口岸主要的是山海关、安东、和营口等地。据山海关、安东、营口三地的不完全的统计：五六月份东北向关内输出货物价值是六千五百二十五万万二千多万元，关内输入东北货物价值是二千五百二十万万元；其中对华北的出入口贸易约占全部贸易额百分之八十八以上。输出物资以粮食、大豆和豆类之品为大宗；输入物资以纱布、棉织品类为大宗。由于东北和关内解放区的交通恢复及物资交流，东北缺乏的物资源源输入，因此市场上外来品的价格日趋低廉。
