　　Critique of "Individualism" Philosophy - Critique of Modern Bourgeois Reactionary Philosophy (Continued and Completed)
　　Pei Huofuxi
　　IV. Can the Material World Not Influence Sensation?

　　Any traditional reason for idealism's opposition to materialism is the hypothetical assumption that consciousness phenomena cannot be clearly explained from a materialistic point of view. Individualists have also endlessly reiterated various arguments on this hackneyed point. "If reason arises," Fring pretends to be serious, "but it is said that the source of reason is not the original reason, then it means that something can be created out of nothing."

　　As everyone knows, one of the most absurd religious theories is the acknowledgment that the entire universe was created by God out of nothing. Therefore, others may, but orthodox theists should refrain from talking about things like creating something out of nothing and should not transfer the patient's problems to healthy people.

　　Fring's argument is a model of the poor metaphysical arguments that idealists pride themselves on. Individualists first draw an insurmountable gap between spirit and matter, and then say, "Spirit" cannot be produced from matter; such production is the production of something from nothing. For metaphysicians, the process of transforming inanimate matter into animate matter is impossible and unimaginable—Fring's argument also proves this point. However, what is impossible for metaphysical idealists, and what will always be a stumbling block for them, is easily solved from the standpoint of scientific dialectical materialism.

　　From the point of view of dialectical materialism, the emergence of consciousness will not be an exception to the general law of development: the emergence of consciousness is completely the same as the emergence of all new factors. However, it is not produced out of nothing, but is produced by matter through a regular dialectical development process, which is in principle possible to be rationally and scientifically understood and explained. Materialist philosophy puts forward a task in front of science, which is to explain the conditions for the emergence and development of consciousness. It believes that such an explanation is possible and satisfactorily points out that science has already passed a lot of roads on the way to achieving such an explanation. However, from the point of view of individualism, such an explanation is unnecessary and impossible. Conducting scientific inquiry in this regard is contrary to the spiritualistic and individualistic dogma.

　　Also, the absurdity and originality of Professor Hawking's anti-materialist arguments on this important issue are no less than Fring's arguments. He repeats Descartes' old-fashioned argument: spirit is an invisible entity, so it cannot be related to the tangible entity of matter. "Where is thought?" Hawking foolishly satirizes. "Is it in the brain? Or in the forehead? ... Is thought oblong? Is the thought when thinking of a cube cubic? Does a big thought take up more space in the brain than a small thought?" Hawking can also ask a question based on this reason: Is the thought when thinking of a donkey donkey-shaped? Hawking's thoughts must take up very little space in his brain, so there is no doubt that his thoughts are not cubic but flat. In fact, in order to prove the absurdity of Hawking's logic, it is enough to apply it to any other characteristics, expressions, and forms of material existence. Is the time Hawking spends discussing the cube problem cubic? Is the sound he makes when discussing this problem cubic? Tangibility is one of the characteristics of matter, and consciousness is another characteristic unique to the highest form of material organization, so it is absurd to apply the definition of space to the function of consciousness, just like adding the description of sound to color or adding the description of color to sound and saying green whistling or bright yellow.

　　In order to find "empirical basis" for spiritualism, individualists also use other tricks. For example, Brightman said: All our experiences are conscious and individual, so the cause of our experience, that is, the kind of thing that causes our feelings, should be consistent with its results, and should also be conscious and individual. In other words: The ultimate cause of our feelings is the creative spirit, God.

　　This idealistic "empirical basis" is a clear example of flat, poor, and anti-scientific metaphysics, which is also used by idealists to find "basis" for idealism. Brightman's poor "wisdom" was inherited from Bishop Berkeley, and as a result, he came to a flat metaphysical law: like produces like; consciousness can only be influenced by another consciousness. The indisputable fact that the material world directly affects human consciousness has long been proven by science and confirmed by the daily experience of millions of people, but the metaphysician Brightman denies this fact. He overthrows the indisputable basic theory of psychophysiology, according to which the direct cause of sensation will never be material, it will always be physiological stimulation. If you believe the individualists, then it is not a material body that feels through the sensory organs, but the "individuality" without a brain, without eyes, and without ears that is feeling.

　　Lenin repeatedly pointed out: Idealists do not understand the process of turning from matter to sensation. The writings of individualists can serve as a clear illustration of this Lenin's topic. They do not understand the process of turning from inanimate matter to animate matter, to matter with conscious characteristics; they deny the fact that has been determined by science: that matter in its development process turns to forms that are higher in organization and richer in feeling ability. Individualists also do not understand the other meaning of the turn of matter to sensation: they deny that the material world can influence human consciousness, they deny that human consciousness is a reflection of this world. The metaphysical method of removing development, jumps, and discontinuity occupies an infinite dominant position in the minds of individualists, and they use this method to defend idealism.

　　The characteristic of individualism's criticism of materialism is that it turns into open criticism of general scientific thought.

　　American reactionaries often put forward a slogan: "We are unwilling to use the method of appeasing science to achieve the goal of reconciliation with science." They advocate a tough policy towards science. For three hundred years, religion—Hawking wrote—"has been waging a war of retreat, and it has tried its best to use every field of nature that has not yet been recognized: the source of life, the mysterious origin of God, the world's amazing adaptability to living things, and the emergence of human reason, at that time all of this could not be explained clearly. Now religion understands that it can no longer settle for temporary refuges, where it may be driven out by the coming scientific discoveries; it can no longer live on the little hope she gets from failed experiments."

　　In our days, when the barbaric American imperialists are turning to an offensive against the democratic rights of workers and the freedom and independence of all nations, their thinkers are sounding the alarm, calling on reactionaries from all countries to attack science. The reactionaries who were frightened by the light of science and hid in the cracks have crawled out one after another. They joined the reactionary's deafening cries against peace, free labor, and true people's democracy, and they viciously attacked free creative reason and progressive science.

　　Individualists are eager to belittle, oppress, restrict, and damage the reputation of science. They not only seize on the weaknesses of scientific knowledge, but also try to obliterate indisputable scientific achievements. The only role they give to science—that is, the role science played in the Middle Ages—is to serve theology. "Science," Fring said kindly, "can clearly prove the rationality of the theistic argument, and similarly, philosophy can also prove that this argument is not illogical at all..." "The best thing philosophy can do is to prove that it is reasonable to admit the existence of God." What else can be said, what a brilliant future those chanting priests of the holy dollar who plan to crusade have arranged for science and philosophy!

　　V. The slavish appearance of individualists—defending capitalism against socialism

　　When individualists exert all their strength to oppose the scientific view of nature, the main field of their reactionary activities is actually not here, but in the scope of social life. Opposing the Marxist, scientific view of social phenomena, opposing revolutionary social theory and practice, defending the social system of the reactionary bourgeois world, and sanctifying American bourgeois pseudo-democracy and imperialist ambitions—this is the main task and ultimate goal of their sophistry and religious preaching.

　　They also realize this task by using "refined" methods of fabrication and slander. The center of the individualists' criticism is the hackneyed anti-Marxist argument that has already been subjected to devastating criticism in Lenin's early works. Hawking tries to use despicable means in his book "Man and the State" to prove the "contradictions" within Marxism. They see this "contradiction" from the fact that Marxism on the one hand establishes the necessity and regularity of the historical process, and on the other hand points out the significance of the revolutionary activities of the working class in order to realize the transition from capitalism to socialism. "Believing in materialistic historical determinism," Hawking said, "is incompatible with 'believing in revolution'. Marxism mixes these two together, thus exposing its 'logical bankruptcy'."

　　For decades, critics of Marxism have constantly repeated that believing in the regularity of the historical process will make people fall into the trap of fatalistic passivity. The absurdity of this argument can be seen from the following point: historical determinism itself is the doctrine of the laws of human activity that constitute the content of the historical process. The concept of historical regularity abstracted from human activities has no rational meaning, just as the concept of chemical regularity has no content and is abstracted from the process in which chemical elements participate. Historical determinism not only "needs" the "support" of human activities, but it simply cannot survive without human activities, because it itself is human activity, and human activity is examined from necessity. To oppose historical determinism to human activity is a foolish idea produced in the minds of idealists who are full of hatred for revolutionary theory.

　　The fictionality and complete bankruptcy of these newly invented "criticisms" have been eloquently confirmed by the entire history of the working-class struggle—especially by the practice of the victorious Russian working-class struggle, which has historical significance for the entire world. The knowledge of the laws of social development not only did not overwhelm the revolutionary activities of the laborers, but on the contrary, the understanding that history will inevitably lead to the replacement of capitalism by socialism is one of the sources of the revolutionary ability that has shocked the world, and that revolutionary ability has been developed by the Party and the working class in the struggle to eliminate capitalism and build a communist society.

　　The knowledge of the laws of social development is a great force in the hands of the Party, which formulates its policies on the basis of the laws of social development. It is precisely because of this that reactionary thinkers want to furiously deny the regularity of social life and madly and maliciously oppose "believing in historical determinism."

　　"The economic theory of society and the state," Hawking continued to "criticize" Marxism, "tries its best to become a realistic theory... but after these theories point out what the social process is, they evade what a true realist should do—that is, to admit that this economic mechanism is normal and therefore correct; instead, they want to overthrow this mechanism."

　　In these few words, Hawking revealed the true class face of his reactionary philosophy. For Hawking, being a "realist" means admitting that the capitalist "economic mechanism is normal and therefore correct." This is the whole significance of the individualists' anti-Marxist march. For them, being a "realist" means defending capitalism and opposing socialism. Under the mask of this "theoretical critic" appeared the face of a slave of the American imperialist bourgeoisie.

　　In his later book "Science and the Idea of God," Hawking once again made a new noise of the old tune of historical determinism. The materialistic view of social life, he said, cannot become a stimulus for activities that are beneficial to society, and cannot become a source of humanism and morality. Without morality, one cannot serve society, and only religion can become the source of morality. Without believing in God, without the authority of God, and without respecting God, humanism such as philanthropy is impossible, because philanthropy is also a powerless expression of love for abstract ideas. Only "superhuman significance" can truly love mankind. Only by serving God can one truly care about mankind.

　　In these clerical discussions, the fundamental opposition between humanism and the theological worldview is very clearly exposed. This worldview does not know true human love, does not know true belief in mankind and its future. For this worldview, God is not a fictional fantasy, but mankind is an abstract concept; for this worldview, man himself is not worthy of love; for this worldview, man is insignificant, and religious dogma is supreme.

　　Hawking cannot fail to see that many facts known to everyone overthrow his clerical ravings. He cannot fail to see that many facts known to everyone prove that the greatest stimulus for people's creative inspiration, lofty morality, and mass heroism is not dead religious dogma, but progressive social ideals.

　　There is a society that abides by a completely scientific materialistic worldview and stands at the head of historical development. It is an unprecedented model of lofty morality and humanitarian enthusiasm in human history. "I think," Hawking had to admit, "for the first time in the history of civilized mankind, perhaps in the entire history of mankind, we have large-scale experimental evidence that can successfully carry out social activities without relying on God. Now in Russia, it has been twenty-five years, and we see before us the atheism of a great nation... Here we can learn something, we observe that great social enthusiasm is a good substitute for traditional religion... and that plays a dominant role (the feeling between nations—Pei Note) is the feeling that... this country and its cause are 'their own country' and 'their own cause', which has resulted in the great efforts of all nations in national defense. Faced with these facts, no one can deny that the active common interests of social groups can forcibly flow out the human nature of moral idealism... We can see that society performs the important function of God, it inspires members of society and saves people from the egoism that has become the deadly enemy of society..."

　　Therefore, the undeniable facts prove the great strength and vitality of the socialist system, and thoroughly destroy the critical theory of the enemies of Marxism and their idealistic slander against communism.

　　But these gentlemen are determined not to admit their defeat in the face of the great victory of socialism. They are trying to escape. But how pitiful and clumsy are their attempts! Just like a person who falls into the water, grabbing at any straw, Hawking also grabbed the "law of pragmatism." "If two ideas have the same consequences, they are the same." "So," Hawking said presumptuously, "if 'God' raises and saves the individual entity through the emotion of personal love for their own life and culture, and if 'society' also raises and saves the individual entity through the same emotion—then God and society are just two names for the same thing." Society is just a "moral synonym of God."

　　If individualists have to use such poor means to defend God and religion, it can be seen how bad their situation is.

　　The absurdity of Hawking's arguments is very obvious. The entire human history is completely opposed to his arguments. If it is said that the concept of society and social welfare, in terms of their influence on people, is the same as the concept of God—that is tantamount to saying that light and darkness, truth and falsehood, are the same. The concept of God is to obscure people's consciousness, belittle them, and turn them into obedient slaves. The concept of social welfare is to awaken people's sense of society and lofty humanism, and to urge people to serve the people heroically.

　　Deceiving the people with theological ravings that obscure the people's consciousness and conceal the people's major tasks and the methods of their realization serves the needs of the exploiters, who are concerned with preserving their rule regardless of the major interests of the masses of the people. It is not that society is the "moral synonym of God," but that God is the synonym of the ideology of the reactionary class that is trying to prevent social revolution.

　　VI. The reaction of individualism is exposed

　　The reaction of the religious individualistic attitude towards social life is fully exposed when individualists analyze the crisis of modern bourgeois civilization. They have no doubt about the existence of a deep social crisis: "The facts of personal, economic, religious, ethnic, and international chaos are such obvious features of modern life that there is no need to make any special diagnosis of the social situation to prove it. Just look around you. That's enough." But where is the way out of this crisis? "How to create a universe from chaos?"—individualists ask. In order to answer these questions, they describe the diseases unique to Western civilization. According to their meaning, the problem lies entirely in the fact that the world is torn apart by cruel struggles, hostility, and constant conflicts. So where is the root of this struggle? Where is the source of these contradictions that tear the world apart? Is it in the terrible injustice of the exploitation system? Is it in the insatiable greed of capitalist robbers? Is it in the incompatibility between the freedom and happiness of all nations and the imperialist plunder system? No, Brightman does not look for the root of all social disasters here. He found their roots in... the soul of every individual. "Individuality is the stage that produces all these conflicts. The world of individuality is the world of conflict..." Therefore, the conclusion is immediately drawn: because "individuality is the stage of conflict," so "victory or defeat should be decided on this stage." Brightman preaches that the battle against the chaos of the present world should be won in the soul of every individual. Fring explains the same idea: Social progress is not the result of changes in external conditions, but the result of passions emanating from the inner world of individuality. According to him, any social transformation, any change in objective reality, cannot guarantee people's happiness.

　　Individualists say, so the choice between materialism and idealism, between materialistic and idealistic solutions to social problems, between materialistic and idealistic ways out of the modern crisis, is very important. "The most important question that everyone has to solve," Brightman wrote, "whether in theory or in practice, is the question of whether he is an idealist or a materialist." Being a materialist means looking for a way out in changing external conditions, reforming social relations, and transforming social strata; being an idealist means looking for a way out in transforming inner individuality and cultivating self-cultivation. Fring said: What we need is not a new social organization, but a new soul. In other words, what we need to change is not the world, but our attitude towards the world.

　　In these arguments, the extremely reactionary political significance of idealistic philosophical theory is very clearly exposed. The idealistic theory of the superiority of the subjective over the objective, the individualistic arguments about the two ways to avoid social crises, and the call to transfer the stage of struggle from the scope of social life to the scope of individual consciousness, are exposed in their practical conclusions to become a violent struggle against the revolutionary activities of the masses to overthrow capitalism.

　　Individualistic theory is aiming its spearhead at the theory of class struggle and social revolution. The theory of developing class struggle into the only realistic means of ending the reactionary forces that hinder social development is opposed by individualists with the preaching of "fraternity," the social "unity" of exploiters and the exploited, and the preaching of "social coordination" within the scope of the existing system. "If," Brightman said, "there is only one method that can be used to build a precious world. This method, Plato called 'faith', and Christians called 'conversion'"—that is, "to change people by appealing to spiritual forces."

　　Hostility to the materialistic view of history, in the hands of individualists, is inseparable from their ambition to obscure the class consciousness of the laborers, paralyze the masses' struggle for freedom, and strengthen the power of the exploiters. Brightman dreams of making the Sermon on the Mount (Note 1) the constitution of the present world and heaven. He calls on the exploited not to fight the exploiters, but to persuade them; he calls on the victims of imperialism not to fight the enslavers, but to appeal to their spiritual strength; he advises them to oppose the atomic robbers and international Shylocks (Note 2) with the preaching of moderation.

　　Individualism's incessant theory of fraternity is not humanism, but the opposite of humanism. The true humanist is inseparable from hatred for the enemies of the laborers and militant hatred for imperialism—the true source of the people's suffering. True, real humanism is to transform human love into a free struggle to lift the imperialist oppression of all nations.

　　VII. Individualist leaders serve the war profiteers

　　Fring's book "The Vitality of Western Culture" is individualism's reply to Spengler's "The Decline of the West," it is the reply of an American imperialist philosopher to a German imperialist philosopher. Fring believes that bourgeois civilization can be preserved and enhanced. He hopes that imperialism can suppress true people's democracy under the guise of bourgeois democracy. Fring's book is a cynical defense of American imperialism, in which he tries to use democratic words to conceal its irreconcilable hatred for democracy.

　　Fring establishes a direct link between the theoretical foundation of individualistic philosophy and the anti-propaganda of bourgeois democracy. He said: Individuality is not only the source of reality, but also the highest value and the foundation of civilization. The development of Western civilization is the development of the concept of individuality. To defend this civilization is to defend the freedom of individuality.

　　Fring takes individuality as the basic category of social life, and he wants to accomplish two tasks at the same time with one arrow. First, eliminate social classes: replace class relations with the relationship between "individuality" and "society." Second, oppose "the masses" to individuality, and use the empty words of the welfare of "general individuality" to conceal his hatred for millions of individualities in the working class.

　　Individualists connect bourgeois democracy with the concept of "sacred individuality." "Individuality," Fring said, "is the highest essence of democracy." Therefore, the natural philosophy of individualism, in the words of its "old hand," is not the 100th incarnation of bourgeois worship of "individuality" that is opposed to the interests of the masses of the people and true democracy, but the "universal democratic foundation."

　　Outside the transparent cloak of Fring's democratic clichés, it is not difficult to see the most ferocious enemy of democracy. Democracy is people's power; a state system that starts from the people, is executed by the people, and serves the interests of the people. Such a view of democracy is by no means acceptable to Fring. For him, "democracy" is the opposite of people's power. And he does not hide this. "Democracy," he openly said, "has become the most ferocious enemy of people's rights as commonly understood..." "Democrats are afraid of the fruits and results of people's sovereignty." People's power—according to Fring, is not a democratic system, but a totalitarian system, a "tyranny of the formerly underprivileged." Fring is full of hatred for the people and people's power, he falsely calls it "totalitarianism," and hides its imperialist essence under the mask of "democracy."

　　"Democracy,"—in Fring's words,—this is not freedom for the people, but freedom for the propertied, for the imperialist robbers. He calls such democracy "qualitative democracy" and opposes it to "quantitative democracy." True democracy, he writes, is not the democracy of laws, institutions, constitutions, and social organizations, but spiritual democracy. Despising the masses, fearing the will of the people, guarding the existing system—this is the true content of individualistic "democracy." So it is not surprising that Brightman called... Hitler an individualist, but with the condition that he is a "degenerate variant of individualism, because he believes that the highest value, even the highest reality, is the 'Aryan' individuality." Brightman is right about one point: the fascist worship of "individuality" is a variant of the same bourgeois anti-democratic imperialist ideology, and another variant of this ideology is American individualism.

　　Through all the writings of individualism, the opposition between individuality and the people, "freedom" and democracy, and social equality is expressed. "If we think," Fring wrote, "that the equal distribution of wealth, privilege, or education will create social innovation, it is in vain." Needless to say! For the likes of Fring, the compeller being compelled, property rights being eliminated, and the universal right to education—these are not innovations, but the end of the world. The "innovation" he dreams of is the compromise between the laborers and the exploiters, and the gentleness, obedience, and docility of the oppressed masses of the people. The "freedom" that Fring praises is opposed to people's power and social equality, this is the "freedom" to make a fortune, the freedom for people to exploit people. This is the "freedom" that individualists strive for.

　　Among the leaders of American individualism, Fring is a particularly arrogant and vicious figure.

　　Wall Street robbers need "space lifeline." For their expansionist desires, the world is too narrow. The scope of all nations and countries has become an obstacle to their "freedom." Fring believes that it is his obligation to apply individualistic holy water to the aggressive ambitions of American monopoly capitalists. "Modern civilization," he wrote, "will not be satisfied with the existing narrow and limited national foundation. If it does not become a cosmopolitan civilization, it will only perish." "The world," he shamelessly said, "the West is too narrow, and the East is too broad."

　　From here, just take one more step to openly defend military adventures; but Fring took this step unswervingly. He not only supports the aggressors, but also is willing to dedicate individualism to serve them. "War itself," he said, "has no power to produce the spirit of dedication... Only when it can arouse religious passion for sacrifice... can it rise to the level of the most amazing miracle." The latest topic of individualism is to call for the use of religious hypnotics to sanctify the heinous imperialist war. Individualist leaders are willing to dedicate themselves to serving the war profiteers as army chaplains.

　　This is the true face of individualism. It preaches "freedom of individuality" for the purpose of affirming spiritual enslavement; he praises "democracy" for the purpose of defending capitalist exploitation, and he uses the name of "fraternity" for the purpose of blessing imperialist aggression.

　　“个性主义”哲学批判　现代资产阶级反动哲学批判（续完）
    裴霍夫斯基
　　四　物质世界不能影响感觉吗？
    任何唯心主义反对唯物主义的传统理由是假想地认为从唯物主义观点是解释不清楚意识现象的。个性主义者对这个陈腐的论据也喋喋不休地发了种种不同的议论。“假使理性产生了，”佛里威林装出郑重其事的样子说，“但是说理性的泉源并不是最初的理性，那末意思就是说可以无中生有了。”
    大家知道，最荒谬的宗教理论之一就是承认全宇宙是被神无中生有地创造出来的。所以别人还可以，但是正统的有神主义者还是免开尊口，不要谈什么无中生有之类的话，不要把病人的毛病移到健康人的身上去。
    佛里威林的论断就是唯心主义者所沾沾自喜的贫乏的形而上学的模范。个性主义者先在精神和物质之间划下一条无法接近的鸿沟，然后又说，“精神”不可能从物质产生，这样的产生就是无中生有的产生。对于形而上学者，从无生命物质转变成有生命物质的过程是不可能有的，是无法想象的，——佛里威林的论断也证明了这一点。但是对于形而上唯心主义者不可能的，对于他们永远成为绊脚石的，却轻易地从科学的辩证唯物主义立场解决了。
    从辩证唯物主义的观点看来，意识的产生不会成为一般发展法则中的例外：意识的产生，是和一切新因素的产生完全一样的。但是它不是无中生有地产生的，而是物质通过合乎规律的辩证的发展过程而产生的，这种发展过程在原则上是可能加以合理的、科学的认识和解释的。唯物主义哲学在科学面前提出了一个任务，就是解释意识产生和发展的条件，它认为这样的解释是可能的，而且满意地指出，科学已经在达到这样解释的道路上通过了不少路。但是从个性主义的观点看来，这样的解释是不必要的，而且也是不可能的。在这方面进行科学的探究，是和唯灵主义的个性主义教条相抵触的。
    还有霍金教授对这个重要问题提出的反对唯物主义的论据之荒唐和原始，也不下于佛里威林的论证。他重复着笛卡儿的老朽的论调：精神是无形的实体，所以，它不可能和有形的实体的物质有关系。“思想在哪里呢？”霍金愚蠢地讽刺道。“它在脑子里吗？还是在额角里？……思想是长形的吗？想到立体时的思想是立体的吗？大思想在脑子里所占的位置要比小思想大吗？”霍金还可以根据这理由提出一个问题：想到驴子时的思想是驴子形的吗？霍金的思想，在脑子里占的地位一定很小，所以，毫无疑问他的思想不是立体的，而是平面的。实际上，为了证明霍金的逻辑之荒谬，只要把它应用到任何别的物质存在的特点、表现和形式上去就够了。霍金化费在讨论立体问题上的时间是立体的吗？他讨论这问题时发出的声音是立体的吗？有形性是物质的特点之一，意识是物质组织最高形式所特有的另一特点，所以把空间的定义应用到意识的作用上去，是很荒谬的，正象把声音的描写加到色彩上去或把色彩的描写加到声音上去和说绿的嘘嘘声或嘹亮的黄色。
    为了给唯灵主义找“经验基础”。个性主义者也用别的诡计。例如勃拉依特曼说：我们的全部经验都是有意识性和个性的，所以我们的经验的原因，就是引起我们感觉的那种东西，应该是符合于它的结果的，而且也是有意识性和个性的。换句话说：我们的感觉的终极原因是创造精神，是神。
    这种唯心主义的“经验基础”是一种平面的、贫乏的和反科学的形而上学的鲜明例子，这种形而上学也就是唯心主义者利用来为唯心主义找“基础”的。勃拉依特曼的这种贫乏的“智慧”是从故柏克莱主教继承下来的，结果他得出这样一个平面的形而上的规律：同类产生同类；意识只能从另一个意识方面感受到影响。物质世界直接影响人的意识的这一个不必争论的事实，早已被科学所证明和被千百万人的日常经验所证实，但是形而上学者勃拉依特曼却否定这一事实。他推翻精神生理学的毋庸争辩的基本理论，依照这种基本理论，感觉的直接原因永远不会是物质的，它永远是生理的刺激。假使相信个性主义者，那就不是物质体通过感觉器官来感觉，而是没有脑子、没有眼睛、没有耳朵的“个性”在感觉了。
    列宁一再指出：唯心主义者不了解从物质转向感觉的过程。个性主义者的著作可以充当这一列宁论题的鲜明说明。他们不了解从无生命物质转向有生命物质、转向富有意识特性的物质的过程；他们否定那已经被科学所确定的事实：就是物质在它发展过程中转向在组织上比较高级的、富有感觉能力的形式。个性主义者也不了解物质转向感觉的另一意义：他们否定物质世界可能影响人的意识，他们否定人的意识是这一世界的反映。把发展、跳跃、不断性的间断除去的形而上方法，在个性主义者思想中占着无限的统治地位，他们利用这种方法来保卫唯心主义。
    个性主义批评唯物主义的特点就是它变成公开批评一般的科学思想。
    美国反动分子常常提出一句口号：“我们不愿意用绥靖科学的方法来达到和科学媾和的目的。”他们主张对科学采取强硬政策。三百年来，宗教——霍金写道——“一直进行着撤退的战争，它竭力利用每一个还没有被认识的自然领域：有生命的泉源、神的神秘的起源、世界对于有生命物体的惊人的适应性、人的理性的出现，那时这一切都还不可能被解释清楚。现在宗教明白了，它不能再苟安于临时的避难所里了，这里它可能被即将来到的科学发现驱逐出来；它不能再靠她从失败的实验所得到的一点点希望来生活了。”
    在我们的日子，野蛮的美帝国主义者向劳动者的民主权利、各民族的自由和独立转取攻势了，他们的思想家敲着警钟，号召各国反动分子进攻科学。被科学的光吓得躲到隙缝里去的反动分子都纷纷爬出来了。他们加入了反动派反对和平、自由劳动和真正人民民主的声嘶力竭的叫嚣，他们凶恶地攻击自由的创造的理性和进步的科学。
    个性主义者磨拳擦掌地想贬低、压迫、制限科学和损害它的名誉。他们不但揪住科学知识的软弱环节，而且竭力抹杀毋庸争论的科学成果。他们赋予科学的唯一作用，——这作用也就是科学在中世纪时代所起过的——就是替神学服务。“科学”，佛里威林仁慈地说，“可以清清楚楚地证明有神主义论断的合理性，与此相同，哲学也可以证明这种论断毫无不合逻辑的地方……”“哲学所能做到的最好的事情就是证明承认神的存在是合理的。”那还有什么可说，那些打算作十字军进军的神圣美元的诵经僧人，给科学和哲学摆布好了一个多么灿烂的前途！
　　五　个性主义者的奴才相貌——保卫资本主义反对社会主义
    个性主义者施出全部力量反对科学的自然观的时候，他们主要的反动活动的领域实际上并不是在这里，而是在社会生活的范围里。反对马克思主义的、科学的社会现象观，反对革命的社会理论和实践，保卫反动的资产阶级世界的社会制度，把美国的资产阶级伪民主和帝国主义野心神圣化——这就是他们的诡辩空论和宗教说教的主要任务和最后目的。
    这个任务，他们也是用“精炼的”伪造毁谤法来实现的。个性主义者的批评中心，就是那早已在列宁早期著作中受到过毁灭性批判的陈腐的反马克思主义论据。霍金在“人和国家”一书中企图采用卑劣的手段来证明马克思主义内部的“矛盾性”。这“矛盾性”，他们是从这里看出的：就是马克思主义一面确立了历史过程的必然性和规律性，同时一面又指出了工人阶级为了实现从资本主义转向社会主义而进行的革命活动的意义。“相信唯物主义的历史决定论，”霍金说，“是和‘相信革命’不能相容的，马克思主义把这两者混合起来，因此而暴露了它‘在逻辑上的破产’。”
    数十年来，批评马克思主义的人不断地反复着说：相信历史过程的规律性会使人们陷入宿命论的消极性的陷阱里去。从下面一点就可以看出这一论据的荒谬：历史决定论本身就是那构成历史过程内容的人类活动的法则的学说。从人类活动中抽象出来的历史规律性的概念，是没有任何理性意味的，正象化学规律性的概念毫无内容而是从化学原素所参与的过程中抽象出来的。历史决定论不但“需要”人类活动的“支持”，而且没有人类活动它简直就无法生存，因为它本身就是人类活动，而人类活动又是从必然性中考察出来的。把历史决定论去和人类活动对立，就是对革命理论充满仇恨的唯心主义者的头脑里所产生的愚劣观念。
    这些新发明的“批评”的虚构性和完全破产性，被全部工人阶级斗争的历史——特别是被那具有了全世界历史性意义的胜利的俄罗斯工人阶级斗争的实践所雄辩地证实了。社会发展法则的知识不但没有淹没劳动者的革命活动，而且相反地，对于历史必然走向资本主义被社会主义取代这一点的了解，就是那震惊全世界的革命能力的泉源之一，那革命能力已经被党和工人阶级在为消灭资本主义和建设共产主义社会的斗争中加以发展了。
    社会发展法则的知识是那在社会发展规律性的基础上制定自己政策的党手里的伟大力量。正因为如此，所以反动的思想家要狂怒地否定社会生活的规律性和疯狂恶毒地反对“相信历史决定论”了。
    “社会和国家的经济理论，”霍金继续“批评”马克思主义道，“竭力想成为现实主义的理论……但是这些理论指出了什么是社会过程之后，却又回避真正现实主义者所应做的事——就是承认这经济机构是正常的，同时因此也是正确的；它们反而要推翻这种机构。”
    在这几句话中，霍金露出了他的反动哲学的真正的阶级面貌。对于霍金，做“现实主义者”，意思就是承认资本主义“经济机构是正常的，同时因此也是正确的”。个性主义者反马克思主义进军的全部意义就在这里。做“现实主义者”，对于他们，意思就是保卫资本主义和反对社会主义。在这“理论批评家”的假面具之下出现了美国帝国主义资产阶级奴才的相貌。
    在他较晚的“科学和神的观念”一书中，霍金又对历史决定论发出了旧调新声的叫嚣。唯物主义的社会生活观，他说，不可能成为有益于社会的活动的刺激力，不可能成为人道主义与道德感的泉源。没有道德感就不能为社会服务，而唯有宗教却可能成为道德感的泉源。不相信神，没有神的威信，不敬爱神，人道主义如博爱就不可能，因为博爱也就是对抽象观念欲爱无力的表示。唯有“超人的意义”才能真正做到爱人类。唯有为神服务，才能真正做到关切人类。
    在这些僧侣主义的议论中，非常明显地暴露出了人道主义和神学世界观的根本对立，这种世界观不知道真正的人类爱，不知道对人类及其未来的真正的信念，对于这种世界观，并非神是虚构的幻想，而人类倒是抽象的概念了；对于这种世界观，人本身是不值得爱的；对于这种世界观，人是微不足道的，而宗教的教条却是至尊无上的。
    霍金不会不看到：有许多人人知道的事实都推翻了他的僧侣主义呓语。他不会不看到：有许多人人知道的事实都证明，人们的创造灵感、崇高道德、群众英雄主义的最大刺激力不是死的宗教教条，而是进步的社会理想。
    遵守着彻底科学的唯物主义世界观的社会是存在的，而且是站在历史发展的头上的，它是人类史上空前的崇高道德和人道主义热情的模范。“我认为，”霍金不得不承认，“在文明人类的历史上，也许是在全部人类史上，我们第一次有了不依靠神而能顺利进行社会活动的大规模的实验证据。现在在俄罗斯，已经有二十五年了，我们面前看见了一个伟大民族的无神主义……这里我们可以学到一些东西，我们观察到，伟大的社会热情原来是传统宗教的很好的代替……而那起着支配作用的（各民族间的——裴注）感觉，就是感觉到……这个国家及其事业是‘他们自己的国家’和‘他们自己的事业’的这种感觉，已经使各民族在国防事业方面的巨大努力有了结果。面对了这些事实，任何人不能否认，社会集团的积极的共同利益是能够强制流出道德唯心主义的人类天性的……我们可以看出：社会执行着神的重要机能，它感召着社会成员和拯救人们挣脱那成为社会死敌的利己主义……”
    因此，无法推翻的事实证明了社会主义制度的伟大力量和生命力，而且澈低摧毁了马克思主义敌人的批评理论及其对共产主义所作的唯心主义毁谤。
    但是这些老爷们决不肯在社会主义的伟大胜利面前承认自己的失败。他们企图逃避。但是他们的企图多么可怜和笨拙！好象掉在水里的人，见草就拉，霍金也拉住了“实用主义的规律”。“假使两种思想有着同一的后果，它们就是同一的。”“所以，”霍金放肆地说，“假使‘神’是通过个人爱他们自己生命和文化的泉源的感情来提高和拯救个人的实体，假使‘社会’也是通过那同一感情来提高和拯救个人的实体，——那末神和社会不过是同一件东西的两个名称而已。”社会不过是“神的道德的同义语”而已。
    假使个性主义者不得不用这样贫乏的手段来保卫神和宗教，可见他们的境况是多么恶劣了。
    霍金的这些议论的荒谬是很显然的。全部人类史完全和他的论断作对。如果说：社会和社会福利的观念，从它们对人们的影响说来，是和神的观念相同的，——那等于说：光明和黑暗，真理和虚伪，都是相同的。神的观念是遮暗人们的意识，贬低他们和使他们变成驯顺的奴隶的。社会福利的观念是催醒人们的社会感和崇高的人道主义，是督促人们为人民作英勇的服务的。
    用遮暗人民意识和隐住人民重大任务及其实现方法的神学呓语来愚弄人民，这是为剥削者的需要服务的，后者所关心的是不顾人民群众的重大利益而保全自己的统治。并非社会是“神的道德的同义语”，而神是那竭力想防止社会革命的反动阶级的利益的意识形态的同义语。
　　六　个性主义的反动性暴露了
    对社会生活所抱的宗教的个性主义态度的反动性，在个性主义者分析现代资产阶级文明危机的时候，完全暴露出来了。深刻的社会危机的存在，他们是毫不怀疑的：“个人的、经济的、宗教的、民族间的、国际间的混沌的事实是现代生活中那末明显的特征，简直不必对社会现状作什么特别诊断来证明。你看看自己周围。就够了。”但是这危机的出路在哪里呢？“怎样从混沌之中创造出宇宙来呢？”——个性主义者问道。为了答复这些问题，他们就来描写西方文明所特有的疾病。照他们的意思，问题完全在于这一点：就是由于世界被残酷的斗争、敌意、不断的冲突搞得四分五裂的缘故。那末这种斗争的根源在哪里呢？这些使世界四分五裂的矛盾的泉源在哪里呢？在于剥削制度的可怕的不公平吗？在于资本主义强盗的贪得无厌吗？在于各民族的自由幸福和帝国主义掠夺制度的不能相容吗？不，勃拉依特曼并不在这里找寻一切社会灾难的根源。他在……每一个个人的灵魂中找到了它们的根源。“个性是产生这一切冲突的舞台。个性的世界是冲突的世界……”因此立刻得出结论：因为“个性是冲突的舞台”，所以“胜败应该在这舞台上决定”。勃拉依特曼作着这样的说教：每一个个人的灵魂中应该赢得那反对现在世界混沌的战斗。佛里威林解释着同一的思想：社会的进步并不是外在条件变化的结果，而是从个性的内在世界发出的激情的结果。照他的意思，任何社会改造，任何客观现实的改变，都保证不了人们的幸福。
    个性主义者说，所以在唯物主义和唯心主义之间，在唯物主义和唯心主义的社会问题解决方法之间，在唯物主义和唯心主义的脱离现代危机的出路之间的抉择是很重要的。“每一个人要解决的最重要的问题，”勃拉依特曼写道，“不论在理论上或者在实践上，就是他做唯心主义者还是做唯物主义者的问题。”做唯物主义者，那意思就是在改变外在条件、改革社会关系、改造社会阶层的道路上去找寻出路；做唯心主义者，那意思就是在改造内在个性、修身养性的道路上去找寻出路。佛里威林说：我们需要的不是新的社会组织，而是新的灵魂。换句话说，我们需要改变的不是世界，而是我们自己对世界的态度。
    在这些议论中，非常清晰地暴露出了唯心主义哲学理论的极端反动的政治意义。主观比客观优势的唯心主义理论，个性主义的关于两条避免社会危机的出路的议论，把斗争舞台从社会生活范围转移到个人意识范围里去的号召，在它们实践的结论中暴露出来，就成为反对群众推翻资本主义的革命活动的狂暴斗争。
    个性主义理论是把它的尖头对准阶级斗争和社会革命的理论的。把阶级斗争发展成为结束那阻碍社会发展的反动势力的唯一现实手段——这种理论，被个性主义者拿“博爱”，剥削者和被剥削者的社会“团结”的说教，在现存制度范围内的“社会协调”的说教来与之对立了。“假使，”勃拉依特曼说，“只有一种方法可以用来建立珍贵的世界。这方法，柏拉图称为‘信念’，而基督徒称为‘改宗’”——就是“用向精神力量控诉的方法来改变人”。
    对唯物主义历史观的敌视，到了个性主义者的手里，就和他们遮暗劳动者的阶级意识，麻痹群众为自由的斗争，加强剥削者的权力的野心连结不分了。勃拉依特曼梦想使山上垂训（注一）成为现世和天国的宪法。他号召被剥削者不要斗争剥削者，而说服他们；他号召帝国主义的牺牲者不要向奴役者作战，而向他们的精神力量控诉；他劝他们用节制的说教来反对原子强盗和国际夏洛克。（注二）
    个性主义的喋喋不休的博爱理论并不是人道主义，而是人道主义的对立物。真正的人道主义者，和对劳动者敌人的仇恨，和对帝国主义——人民灾难的真正来源——的战斗性仇恨，是不可分的。真正的、现实的人道主义是把人类爱变成为解除各民族的帝国主义压迫的自由斗争。
　　七　个性主义的领袖在为战争贩子效劳
    佛里威林的“西方文化的生命力”一书是个性主义对施宾格勒的“欧洲的落日”一书的答复，是一个美帝国主义哲学家对一个德帝国主义哲学家的答复，佛里威林相信资产阶级文明是可能加以保全和增强的。他希望帝国主义能在资产阶级民主的外衣之下镇压真正的人民的民主，佛里威林的书是美帝国主义的犬儒主义的辩护书，书中想用民主的语句来掩饰它对民主的不可调和的仇恨。
    佛里威林建立了个性主义哲学理论基础和资产阶级民主的反宣传之间的直接联系。他说：个性不但是现实的本源，而且是最高的价值，文明的基础。西方文明的发展就是个性观念的发展。保卫这文明，就是保卫个性的自由。
    佛里威林拿个性作为社会生活的基本范畴，他想一箭双雕地同时解决两个任务。第一，消灭社会阶级：用“个性”和“社会”的关系来代替阶级关系。第二，拿“群众”去和个性对立起来，用“一般个性”的福利的空话来掩饰他对劳动阶级中千百万个性的仇恨。
    个性主义者拿资产阶级民主去和“个性神圣”的观念联系起来。“个性，”佛里威林说：“是民主的最高本质”。所以个性主义的自然哲学，用它的“老手”的话说，并不是资产阶级崇拜那和人民群众利益及真正民主相对立的“个性”的第一○○一种化身，而是“普遍的民主基础”。
    在佛里威林的民主滥调的透明外衣之外，不难看出一个最凶暴的民主敌人。民主就是人民政权；从人民出发，由人民执行和人民利益服务的国家制度。这样的民主观决不是佛里威林所能接受的。对于他，“民主”是人民政权的对立物。而且他也并不隐瞒这一点。“民主，”他公然说，“已经成为通常所了解的人民权利的最凶恶的敌人了…”“民主人士是惧怕人民主权的果实和结果的。”人民政权—照佛里威林说，并不是民主主义的制度，而是全体主义的制度，是“以前无特权者的暴政”。佛里威林对人民和人民政权充满着仇恨，他造谣地称它为“全体主义”，而把它的帝国主义本质隐藏在“民主”的假面具之下。
    “民主”，—用佛里威林的话说，——这不是给人民的自由，而是给有产者、给帝国主义强盗的自由。他称呼这样的民主为“质的民主”，而拿它去和“量的民主”对立起来。真正的民主，他大书特书地说，不是法律、制度、宪法、社会组织的民主，而是精神的民主。蔑视群众，惧怕人民的意志，警卫现存制度——这就是个性主义“民主”的真正内容。所以并不奇怪，勃拉依特曼称……希特勒为个性主义者，不过附带一个条件，就是他是一个“个性主义的退化的变种，因为他认为最高的价值、甚至最高的现实是‘亚利安型’的个性”。勃拉依特曼有一点是对的：法西斯主义的崇拜“个性”，—一是同一个资产阶级反民主的帝国主义意识形态的变种，而这种意识形态的另一变种就是美国的个性主义。
    通过个性主义的一切著作，个性和人民、“自由”和民主、社会平等的对立都表现出来了。“如果我们认为，”佛里威林写道，“财富、特权或教育的平等分配会造成社会的革新，那是徒然的。”那还用说！对于佛里威林之流，强征者被强征，产权被消灭，全民的教育权——这都不是革新，而是世界末日。他所梦想的“革新”，是劳动者和剥削妥协，是被压迫人民群众的温和、顺从、驯服。佛里威林所称颂的“自由”，是和人民政权及社会平等对立的，这是发财的“自由”，人剥削人的自由。个性主义者所争取的就是这种“自由”。
    在美国个性主义领袖中间，佛里威林是特别骄横和狠毒的人物。
    华尔街强盗需要“空间生命线”。对于他们的扩张欲望，世界是太窄小了。各民族国家的范围成了他们“自由”的障碍。佛里威林认为他自己的义务是用替美国独占资本家的侵略野心施个性主义的圣水。“现代文明，”他写道，“不会满足于现有的狭隘有限的民族基础。如果它不成为世界主义的文明，那末只有灭亡。”“世界，”他无耻地说，“西方太窄小，而对东方是太广大了。”
    从这里起，只要再跨一步，就要为军事冒险公开辩护了；而佛里威林却不屈不挠地跨了这一步。他不但拥护侵略者，而且愿意献出个性主义来为他们效劳。“战争本身，”他说，“是没有力量产生献身的精神的……唯有当它能引起宗教性的牺牲激情的时候……才能上升到最惊人的奇迹的水准。”个性主义的最新论题是号召用宗教的催眠剂来使万恶的帝国主义战争神圣化。个性主义领袖愿意自己献身担任军队牧师的地位来为战争贩子效劳。
    个性主义的真面目就是这样。它说教“个性自由”，目的是为了肯定精神的奴役；他赞扬“民主”，目的是为了保卫资本主义剥削，他利用“博爱”的名义，目的是为了替帝国主义侵略祝福。（梁香译自苏联“布尔塞维克”半月刊一九四八年第八期）
