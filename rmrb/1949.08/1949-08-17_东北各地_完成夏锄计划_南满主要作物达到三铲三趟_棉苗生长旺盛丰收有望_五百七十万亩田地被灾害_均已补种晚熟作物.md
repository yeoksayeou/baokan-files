Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 15th—The vast rural areas of Northeast China have victoriously completed summer weeding. This year's summer weeding was completed amidst fierce struggles to eradicate insect pests, replant disaster areas, and combat drought and floods. According to a report from the Agricultural Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee: Major crops in Southern Manchuria, such as sorghum, corn, and millet, generally achieved the plan of three hoeings (weeding) and three cultivations (soil loosening). In Northern Manchuria, about half of the fields exceeded the task of two hoeings and two cultivations, and were done in a timely and meticulous manner. In Liaoxi Province, three-quarters of the main crops reached three hoeings and three cultivations; even in some areas and villages where the habit of three hoeings and three cultivations was previously poor, three hoeings and two cultivations were achieved this year. Jilin Province also basically achieved the task of three hoeings and three cultivations, and many counties and districts, especially millet fields, were hoed and cultivated four times. In Heilongjiang Province, 40 percent achieved three hoeings and three cultivations, and the rest completed the plan of two hoeings and two cultivations, an improvement over last year's summer weeding (mostly two hoeings and two cultivations), and was completed ten days earlier. This year, in the provinces of Northern Manchuria and Rehe Province, half of the female labor force participated in summer weeding. In Zhenlai County, Heilongjiang Province (a newly established county, formed from parts of Zhen Dong and Da Lai), 70 percent of women went to the fields, weeding more than 84,000 mu. During the peak period of summer weeding, all government agencies and military units drew manpower to go to the countryside to help farmers hoe and cultivate, achieving considerable results. The work of weeding paddy fields was generally more timely and meticulous than last year, and most paddy fields this year implemented intensive cultivation. Most paddy fields in Liaodong, Jilin, and Songjiang provinces were fertilized twice. All 1,276,000 mu of cotton fields in Northeast China have also been hoed three times. Except for some areas and villages in Jinzhou, Yi County, Suizhong, and Xingcheng counties of Liaoxi Province, which suffered from insect, hail, and wind disasters, cotton seedlings are growing vigorously in other areas, promising a bumper harvest.

Since summer weeding began, varying degrees of insect, hail, wind, and drought disasters have occurred in various places. In addition, the Liao River is in a flood cycle this year, so farmers in various places have combined summer weeding with disaster relief and flood prevention. The insect plague that once spread across more than 50 counties in Liaoxi, Songjiang, and Heilongjiang provinces was completely eradicated in early July with the timely assistance of personnel dispatched by the Agricultural Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee to organize farmers to catch them. Farmers in most parts of Songjiang, small parts of Jilin, and more than 30 counties in Heilongjiang Province, which suffered from drought, dug wells and tapped springs to irrigate the land under the urgent call of the provincial committees and people's governments. After a long drought, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces received rainfall in late July and early August, respectively, and more than 200,000 mu of withered seedlings in Jilin were revived. More than 5.7 million mu of land destroyed by disasters has also been replanted with late-maturing crops. The people's governments of Rehe, Liaoxi, Songjiang, and Jilin provinces alone loaned 2,850 tons of late-season seeds, ensuring the timely completion of replanting in disaster areas. Regarding flood prevention, farmers along the Liao River, under the leadership of party committees and people's governments at all levels, repaired dams and built dikes, and successfully weathered the July flood season. Various places have now successively finished hoeing and begun to shift to sideline production such as haymaking and manure composting, and continue to step up dike construction and field protection to prevent autumn floods, while drought-stricken areas continue to carry out drought resistance work.

　　东北各地
  　完成夏锄计划
  　南满主要作物达到三铲三趟
    棉苗生长旺盛丰收有望
  　五百七十万亩田地被灾害
    均已补种晚熟作物
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】东北广大农村已胜利完成夏锄。今年夏锄是在扑灭虫灾、补种灾地，并与旱灾、水灾进行激烈的斗争中完成的。据东北行政委员会农业部报告：南满的高粱、玉米、谷子等主要作物，一般达到了三铲（锄草）三趟（耘土）的计划，北满约有半数田地超过了两铲两趟任务，并作到了及时和细致。辽西省的主要作物有四分之三达到了三铲三趟，即过去三铲三趟习惯较差的部分区村，今年也作到了三铲两趟。吉林省也基本上达到了三铲三趟的任务，并有许多县区特别是谷子地铲、趟了四遍。黑龙江省有百分之四十做到了三铲三趟，其余完成了二铲二趟计划，较去年夏锄（大部是两铲两趟）提高了一步，并提早十天完成。今年北满各省及热河省，有半数妇女劳动力参加夏锄，黑龙江省镇赉县（新设县，镇东、大赉各一部合成）妇女有百分之七十下地，共锄草八万四千余亩。各地机关、部队在夏锄紧张时期，均曾抽出人力下乡帮助农民铲趟，获得不少成绩。水田的蓐草工作，一般较去年及时细致，今年大部稻田都实行了精耕细作。辽东、吉林、松江等省的水田，大部都上了二遍肥料。全东北一百二十七万六千余亩的棉田也铲完三遍，除辽西省之锦州、义县、绥中和兴城等县部分区村遭受虫、雹、风灾害外，各地棉苗生长旺盛，可望丰收。
    夏锄以来，各地不断发生了程度不同的虫、雹、风、旱等灾害，加以今年辽河又值洪水周期，因此各地农民均结合夏锄进行了救灾防汛等工作。曾蔓延于辽西、松江、黑龙江等省五十余县的虫灾，经东北行政委员会农业部及时派员协助组织农民捕捉，已于上月初旬全部扑灭。发生旱灾的松江大部地区，吉林小部地区及黑龙江三十余县的农民，在各该省委及人民政府紧急号召下，以挖井，掏泉眼等办法，进行浇地。久旱的吉林及黑龙江省，先后于七月下旬及本月初旬降雨，吉林二十余万亩枯苗得以复苏。被灾害所毁坏的五百七十万余亩地，亦已补种晚熟作物，仅热河、辽西、松江、吉林四省人民政府，即贷发了二千八百五十吨晚田种籽，保证了受灾地区及时完成补种。关于防汛工作，沿辽河农民在各级党委和人民政府领导下修坝筑堤，已胜利渡过七月汛期。各地现已相继挂锄，开始转入打草、沤粪等副业生产，并继续加紧筑堤护田，以防秋汛，旱灾地区则继续进行抗旱工作。
