　　A History of American Aggression Against China

　　I. Aggression Against China by Following or Through Other Countries (Continued 4)
    The large-scale American aggression against Korea created two new situations: First, the United States was prepared to enter into a direct military conflict with China before Japan, which could be considered a plan that the United States should have had. In the autumn of 1891, China received a letter from London: "The United States has specially dispatched a naval army to China to prepare for trouble." Later, due to a lack of favorable opportunities, it was not launched. The other was that under the combined oppression of foreign aggressors and the Korean ruling class, it aroused another revolutionary movement of the Korean people against American and Japanese aggression—the "Donghak Party" movement. In 1893, the "Donghak Party" began by raising the clear banner of "Punishing the Japanese Dwarfs (Japan) and Rejecting the Barbarians (America)" (later, its program also included "Exterminating the Barbarians and Dwarfs, and Clarifying the Holy Way") to respond to the American and Japanese aggressors. Yuan Shikai, the Qing Resident Commissioner in Korea, reported to the government: "... tens of thousands of 'evil bandits' (?), will eventually succeed, and cannot be resolved by persuasion. Most of the local people in Hansong (Seoul) resent the government, and eight or nine out of ten are thinking of rebellion... The flags of the 'bandits' have words such as 'Punishing the Japanese Dwarfs and Rejecting the Barbarians'." The Qing government's policy was not to assist this revolutionary movement to liberate the Korean people from American and Japanese oppression, but as usual, to falsely accuse the people of being "bandits" (this is the consistent term used by reactionary rulers to refer to revolutionary people) and carry out counter-revolutionary suppression. As a result, the Sino-Japanese War, supported by the United States and launched by Japan, was triggered by the contradiction between the Qing court and the United States and Japan.
    In June 1894 (the 20th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu), the Qing government notified Japan: "At the request of Korea, troops are being sent to assist in suppressing the internal rebellion." Japan, on the other hand, notified the Qing government that it would send troops, on the grounds that "the Imperial Government has never recognized Korea as a dependency of China." At that time, the United States was very concerned that Japan did not have a good chance of winning. The American Minister to China, Charles Denby, reported to his country that "Japan has no more than 120,000 troops in the whole country, and they are also unevenly matched. Li Hongzhang of China alone has 50,000 elite soldiers," implying that Japan might find it difficult to win. On July 9, the US government ordered its Minister to Tokyo, E. Dun, to advise the Japanese government not to act rashly without full confidence, but its wording was exceptionally high-sounding:
    "The United States government has always held friendship with Japan and Korea, so it hopes that Japan will respect the independence and sovereignty of Korea. If Japan raises an army without reason, turning a weak and defenseless neighboring country into a battlefield of war, the President of the United States will regret it."
    Japan did not agree to this advice. On August 1, China and Japan simultaneously declared war, and the United States put on its usual disguise, announcing so-called "neutrality," but in reality, it had placed all its hopes on Japan's victory. When the war had just begun and Japan had not yet begun to reform Korea's internal affairs, the American Minister to Korea reported to the American government, emphasizing Japan's "good intentions" toward Korea and the role of "eliminating China's suzerainty in one fell swoop" for the United States. In his book "Diplomatic History of China," the Japanese Kubota Bunzo said: At that time, "Americans believed that the success of the Japanese was tantamount to the success of the American disciples." The true attitude of the United States toward the Sino-Japanese War can be seen from this. On September 16 and 17 of the same year (August 17 and 18 of the 20th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu), the Qing army was badly defeated at Pyongyang and in the Yellow Sea. The "Yamen of Foreign Affairs" in Beijing contacted the ministers of various countries in Beijing and telegraphed Chinese ministers stationed in various countries to visit the governments of various countries and ask them to mediate. However, on September 18, news that the United States was unwilling to mediate spread throughout the world, because at this time the United States believed that Japan had not yet achieved a "global victory," and mediation would only be beneficial to China, and the time was not yet right for Japan, so it refused. The Qing government had no other choice but to seek help from Britain. Britain was willing to jointly mediate with the United States, France, Germany, and Russia. On October 6, the British Ambassador to the United States, Gao Chuan, delivered a note to the US State Department, hoping to jointly mediate the Sino-Japanese War with the United States on the condition of Korean independence and China's compensation for Japan's war expenses. The United States was certainly not satisfied with such peace terms for Japan, and because of the special position that the United States itself held in this war, it was unwilling to be in the company of Britain and France in mediation. On the 12th of the same month, US Secretary of State Gresham replied to the British ambassador: "I sincerely hope that China and Japan will make peace fairly under conditions that are beneficial to both parties (?) and do not harm Korea, but I cannot jointly mediate with various countries as requested." In early October, the Chinese Minister to the United States, Yang Ru, repeatedly requested the United States to mediate, but was still rejected. He then reported to the "Yamen of Foreign Affairs":
    "The State Department (US Secretary of State) said that if we talk about peace at this time, we may be despised by others. European countries have many opportunities and all have the intention of benefiting from Chinese and Korean land. China must win a great victory before peace talks can be appropriate."
    This is completely a piece of nonsense to protect Japan and play tricks on China!
    The war continued until November, and the Chinese army suffered repeated defeats. Liaodong and Shandong simultaneously reported alarms, and the Qing government was greatly shaken. In desperation, it again asked the United States to mediate alone. At this time, Japan could be said to have achieved a "global victory." The US government considered that a new situation might arise, that is, if Japan continued to advance, it would inevitably cause international intervention, which would be detrimental to Japan—that is, it would be detrimental to the United States' aggression against China through Japan. A historical document records what Gresham said to the Japanese Minister to the United States at this time: "Japan should stop the war. If it continues to fight and beats China to pieces, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and other countries will definitely divide it up..." For this reason, the US government conditionally accepted the Qing court's request, saying that both China and Japan must agree. In other words, Japan must agree, because China was the requesting country, and naturally had no reason to disagree. This was the United States taking advantage of China's crisis to raise its own status and elevate Japan's methods. At the same time, it gave the Japanese government a public note, as usual, high-sounding, the full text of which is:
    "The regrettable war between China and Japan has not jeopardized the United States' Asian strategy. The United States' intention toward the two belligerent countries is to value friendship without bias, and to uphold the meaning of neutrality. If the fighting is prolonged and the Japanese naval and land offensives cannot be stopped, European powers with an interest in the situation in the East may make unfavorable demands on Japan to promote the end of the war. The President of this country has always had deep goodwill toward Japan. If he comes out to work for peace in the East, without harming the reputation of either China or Japan, and arbitrates, he wants to ask whether the Japanese government promises this?"
    Although Japan knew that there was no better "mediator" than the United States, it was concerned about another level, that is, if the double act played by the United States and Japan against China was exposed, it would also have the danger of causing international intervention. Therefore, there was still a need to avoid suspicion between the United States and Japan. Thus, it publicly replied to the United States: China has not directly asked Japan for peace, and Japan does not need the help of friendly countries. The Japanese Foreign Minister Mutsu Munemitsu secretly said to the American Minister to Japan, Tan An: "If the Japanese government now openly asks the US government to be the arbitrator between China and Japan, it may inevitably lead to the intervention of other third countries, so we must avoid this. If China initiates peace talks in the future, and the United States mediates and exchanges opinions with each other, our government will deeply rely on the friendship of the US government." Later, after the Qing government directly requested peace from Japan through the American Minister to Beijing, Charles Denby, and with the assistance of Detring, an Englishman from the Tianjin Customs, after several twists and turns, the Treaty of Shimonoseki, the most humiliating page in Chinese history, was finally signed on April 17, 1895 (the 21st year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu).
    Some people believe that in the Sino-Japanese War, "the one who initiated the peace talks and consistently mediated was the United States," which is completely contrary to the facts. As for Japan's final announcement of a ceasefire, the United States was not actually playing a mediating role, but was the result of careful planning for the future of the war for the common interests of the United States and Japan.

　　美国侵华史
    刘大年
　　一　追随或通过别国向中国侵略（续四）
    美国这样大规模对朝鲜侵略，产生两种新的形势：一是美国准备在日本之先与中国进入正面军事冲突，这可算美国应有的一种打算，一八九一年秋间中国接到伦敦来信：“美国特派水师一军前往中国，以备闹事之用”，后因缺少有利机会，没有发动。另一是在外国侵略者和朝鲜统治阶级合力压榨之下，激起朝鲜人民又一次反美日侵略的革命运动——“东学党”运动，“东学党”在一八九三年，一开始就揭出了“讨倭（日）斥夷（美）”的鲜明旗子（后来其纲领中也有“逐灭夷倭，澄清圣道”）以回答美日侵略者。清驻韩商务总办袁世凯报告政府：“……‘邪匪’（？）数万，终必成事，断非谕说所能解，汉京土民多怨政府，思乱者，十居八九……该‘匪’旗号有‘讨倭斥夷’等字样”，清政府的政策，不是援助这个革命运动，使朝鲜人民从美日压迫下解放出来，而是照例的诬人民为“匪”（这是反动统治者对革命人民千篇一律的称呼），进行反革命镇压。结果，因清廷与美日的矛盾引起由美国支持，日本出面的中日战争。
    一八九四年（光绪二十年）六月，清政府照会日本：“应朝鲜之请派援兵戡定内乱”，日本则以“帝国政府从未承认朝鲜为中国之属邦”为理由，照会清政府出兵。当时美国很耽心日本没有胜利把握，美驻中国公使田贝（ＣｈａｒｌｅｓＤｅｎｂｙ）给本国的报告说：“日本全国有兵不过十二万，而又参差不齐，中国李鸿章一人即有精兵五万”，言外之意，恐日本难于获胜。美政府于七月九日令其驻东京公使谭安（Ｅ．Ｄｕｎ）对日政府作一劝告，在没有十分把握时不要轻举，其措词则异常冠冕堂皇：
    “美国政府对日本及朝鲜两国笃抱友谊，故希望日本尊重朝鲜之独立并主权，若日本兴无名之师，使微弱不能防御之邻国化为兵火修罗场，则合众国大总统当为惋惜。”
    日本对这个劝告没有同意。八月一日中日两国同时宣战，美国遂搬出它惯用的伪装面孔，宣布所谓“中立”，实际已把全部希望寄托在日本的胜利上。战争才开始，日本还没有着手改革朝鲜内政时，美驻朝鲜公使向美政府报告中着重申述日本对朝鲜的“好意”及“一举而消灭中国之宗主权”对美国的作用。日人洼田文三的支那外交通史上说：当时“美人认为日本人的成功，不啻美国人弟子的成功”，美国对中日战争真实态度，由此可见。同年九月十六、十七两日（清光绪二十年八月十七、十八）清军于平壤，黄海大败亏输，北京“总理衙门”即一面与北京各国公使接洽，一面电驻各国中国公使分访各国政府，请出为调停。而在九月十八日美国不愿调停的消息传遍世界，因为这时美国以为日本还没有取得“全局胜利”，调停只是于中国有利，对日本方面则尚非其时，故加以拒绝。清政府遑迫无计，向英国求救，英愿与美法德俄等国共同调处，十月六日英国驻美大使高川送达美国务院一件照会，希望在朝鲜独立及中国赔偿日本战费条件下，与美国共同调停中日战争。美国对于这样的议和条件，当然替日本不能满意，而且美国本身在这个战争中所处特别地位，也不愿在调停时与英法等国为伍，同月十二日美国务卿葛利歇穆（Ｇｒｅｓｈａｍ）答复英使：“甚愿中日两国于有利双方（？）无损高丽条件下，公平讲和，但不能如所请各国共同调停也。”十月初，中国驻美公使杨儒又数度请求美国调停，依然遭到拒绝后向“总理衙门”报告说：
    “外务（美国务卿）云，此时言和恐为人藐视，欧洲各国，伺隙者多，均有利中韩土地之心，中国须获一大胜，议和方得体。”
    这完全是袒护日本，戏弄中国的一片鬼话！
    战争继续到十一月，中国军队节节失利，辽东山东同时告警，清政府大为震动，不得已，再请美国单独调停。这时日本可谓已获“全局胜利”，美国政府考虑到一种新的情况可能发生，即如果日本继续前进，必然引起国际干涉，将对日本不利——亦即对美国通过日本向中国侵略不利，在一个历史性文件上记载着这时葛利歇穆对日本驻美公使所讲的话：“日本应当停战，假使再继续下去，把中国打得落花流水，英、法、德、俄等国，一定要瓜分它……。”有了这层原因，美政府一面对清廷的请求有条件接受，谓必须中日两国同意，换句话说必须日本同意，因中国是请求国，自无不同意之理，这是美国乘中国之危，以自高身价并抬高日本的手法；一面给日本政府一个公开照会，照例的冠冕堂皇，全文是：
    “令人痛叹的中日两国战争，毫未危及美国亚洲之政略，美国对两交战国之意向，在不偏不党重视友谊，守中立之义。若战斗延长无法制止日本海陆进攻时，与东方局面有利害关系之欧洲强国，或将对日本提出不利要求以促战争之终局。本国大总统从来对日本怀有深笃好意，倘对东方和平出而执劳，不损及中日两国任何一方名誉之仲裁，欲问日本政府是否承诺之？”
    日本虽明知对它最有利的“调停”人，没有比美国再好的了，但顾虑到另一层，即假如日美对中国所演双簧，一旦把戏露底，同样有引起国际干涉的危险，因此美日之间，还有避免嫌疑必要，于是公开答复美国：中国没有直接向日本请和，日本还不须友国帮助。日外相陆奥宗光则秘密对美驻日公使谭安说：“日本政府现在若公然请美国政府为中日间之仲裁者，或不免招致其他第三国之干涉，故不能不避免此事，异日若由中国开讲和之端绪时，美国居间交换彼此之意见，则我政府当深倚赖美国政府之厚谊。”后来清政府经过美驻北京公使田贝向日本直接请和，再加上天津海关税务司英人德璀琳赴日活动，几经曲折，中国历史上最耻辱一页的马关和约终于一八九五年（光绪二十一年）四月十七日签订。
    有人以为在甲午战争中“启议和之端绪且始终居间者，厥为美国”，这是完全违反事实的。至于最后日本宣布停战，实际上美国不是起的一种调停作用，而是为了美日共同利益，对战争前途精心策划的结果。
