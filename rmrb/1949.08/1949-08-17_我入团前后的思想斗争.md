　　My Ideological Struggle Before and After Joining the League
    Yang Yan
    Because I was poor, people looked down on me in the past, saying my father was a stinking donkey meat seller. In the Kuomintang school in southern Shaanxi, I suffered from a serious illness for three months, and because I had no money for treatment, I personally experienced neglect and contempt. Some people said behind my back: "If you're poor, don't come to school!" Because I shaved my head due to illness, everyone called me "Baldy" in a derogatory tone. Because of a lot of stimulation, I developed a personalistic desire for revenge. I thought that one day, I would show them!
    My own situation and the influence of my elder brother's early participation in the revolution made me determined to go to the Liberated Area, so I entered China University.
    When I came to China University to study, I wanted to acquire personal skills in the future so that I could be successful and solve the problem of family life, and I was willing to learn some "practical knowledge." I thought it was a fraud to enter the political class to learn politics and transform myself. What was there to learn? I would be leaving in four months! I was making trouble about this. Although the comrades explained to me in good faith, I felt that they were obsessed after eating millet for a few days!
    When I saw others approaching and talking to superiors, I looked at them with the eyes of the old society, thinking that they were currying favor and flattering, and I looked down on them. I regarded "self-cultivation" as noble, disliked discussion and collective study, let alone any organization.
    At first, when I heard about the organization of the New Democratic Youth League, I was very resistant in my mind. League members progressed quickly, always enduring hardship before enjoying comfort, and I thought it was "affected." I also thought their sincere attitude when they talked to me was fake. I often magnified their shortcomings and ignored their advantages. Thinking about it now, it was really wrong!
    Due to a preliminary understanding of revolutionary theory, as well as the simple style of the cadres, always being so kind and sincere to the students, and the students' genuine mutual help and friendship, I have changed somewhat. Especially when the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops were preparing to disrupt Shijiazhuang and the school was transferred, during the three-hundred-mile march, many moving examples of great mutual assistance and friendship occurred: Many students carried luggage for the smaller, female, and weaker students, set up advance posts, looked after houses, boiled water and cooked meals, and arranged for students to stay, and the relationship between the army and the people was so close. Among them, the most active were the Youth League members.
    From a theoretical point of view, and under the influence of the exemplary role of the Youth League members, I had a very good impression of the League; but when I applied to join the League, my worries came again: If I joined the League, I would not be free, and everything would be handled by the organization, so it would not be possible to go to work according to my own wishes after graduation! Joining the League, there are frequent meetings, what a hassle! League members' treatment must be a supply system, what about the family? I was wandering, hesitating, and struggling.
    In ideological struggle, in learning, I figured it out. What is freedom? Did I have freedom before? I didn't have freedom before! I wanted to study but didn't have the freedom to study! My family wanted to live but didn't have the freedom to eat! I was sick but didn't have the freedom to see a doctor! In a word, there is no freedom without emancipation. To be emancipated, we must make revolution; to win the revolution, we must organize, and we must have discipline. This is the conscious discipline for the people's emancipation and their own emancipation, which must be consciously observed and cannot be maintained by coercion. Only when the laboring masses are all emancipated can my family be emancipated. Meetings are held to solve problems, there are problems to be solved, what's the trouble?
    I figured it out, I asked to join the League.
    Now, I am a member of the New Democratic Youth League, and under the leadership of the Communist Party and the leadership of the superior League committee, I will overcome my weaknesses and better serve the people as a hired laborer. I hope to make more progress and become a more glorious Communist Party member in the near future.

　　我入团前后的思想斗争
    杨彦
    因为我穷，过去别人看不起我，说我父亲是个臭卖驴肉的。在陕南国民党学校中，三个月的大病，没钱医治，亲身尝受着冷落和鄙弃。有人背后说：“家穷就甭来上学！”因病把头发剃秃了，大家以诬蔑的口气，叫我“秃子”。因为很多的剌激，使我产生了一种个人主义的报复心。我想总有一天，叫他们看看老子的！
    自己的处境和受大哥早年参加革命的影响，使我决心奔向解放区，于是走进了华大。
    我到华大学习，为了将来个人有本事，吃的开，能解决家庭生活问题，我愿意学一些“实际的学问”。入政治班学政治，改造自己，我认为是骗人。学个啥？四个月就要出去！我在为这闹情绪。尽管同志们向我善意解说，我却觉得他们吃了几天小米着了迷啦！
    我见到别人和上级接近谈问题时，就拿旧社会的眼光看他，认为他们是讨好，是奉迎，对他们看不起。自己以“独善其身”为清高，不喜欢讨论和集体学习，更谈不到什么组织起来。
    最初听到有新民主主义青年团的组织时，在思想上非常对抗。团员们进步快，什么吃苦在前，享乐在后，我认为是“做作”的。他们和我谈问题时的诚恳态度，我也认为是假的。我常常扩大他们的缺点，湮没他们的优点。想起来真是太不对了！
    由于对革命理论的初步认识，及干部朴素作风，永远对同学那样亲切诚恳，同学们的真正互助友爱，我有些转变了。特别在蒋匪军准备扰乱石家庄，学校转移的时候，在三百里地行军中，高度互助友爱的事情，发生好多动人的实例：很多同学，替小的、女的、弱的同学背行李，打前站，看房子，烧水做饭，安置同学们住宿，而且军民关系又搞得那么亲密。这其中，最积极的要算青年团员们了。
    从理论上，从青年团员们模范作用影响下，我对团有了很好的印象；但申请入团吧，顾虑又来了：入了团不自由，一切都由组织处理，那么毕业后随自己意见去作工作也不可能了！入了团，常开会，真是麻烦！团员待遇一定是供给制，家庭怎么办？我在彷徨，在犹豫，在斗争着。
    在思想斗争中，在学习中，我打通了。什么是自由？自己以前有没有自由？我以前没有自由！愿意求学而没有求学的自由！家庭愿意生活而没有吃饭的自由！病了没有看病的自由！一句话，不翻身就没有自由。要想翻身就要革命；要革命胜利就要组织起来，就要有纪律。这是为了人民翻身，自己翻身的自觉纪律，是要自觉遵守的，也不是靠强迫来维持的。只有劳苦大众都翻了身，我家庭才能翻身。开会是为了解决问题，有问题要解决，有啥麻烦的？
    我想通了，我要求入团。
    现在，我是个新民主主义青年团员了，我将在共产党领导下，在上级团委领导下，克服自己弱点，更好为人民去当长工。我希望更加进步，不久将来，能当个更光荣的共产党员。
