　　Improve Cultural Learning
  　North China People's Liberation Army Newspaper Publishes Editorial
    The "North China People's Liberation Army" newspaper, the organ of the Political Department of the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, published an editorial on the 13th of this month entitled "Improve Cultural Learning." The editorial pointed out: "Learning culture is one of the important contents of our current army building. The importance of learning culture lies in the fact that culture is a key to improving military and political skills. Mastering this key will enable us to step into the treasure house of political theory and military science, and obtain weapons from within to arm ourselves. Otherwise, our further improvement will be greatly limited. The importance of learning culture also lies in the fact that most of our comrades, due to being oppressed in the old society, did not have the opportunity to learn culture; after joining the revolution, although they have gained some cultural knowledge due to the leadership's emphasis and personal efforts, the long-term tense and cruel war environment has limited our learning to a certain extent. Generally speaking, our cultural level is low, so when entering regular army building, there is an urgent need to learn culture.
    Our army is a cultured army and has always attached importance to culture. We regard cultural work as an indispensable work to improve political awareness and combat effectiveness, and as an important part of political work. This is reflected in: First, our army pays attention to absorbing revolutionary intellectuals into the army and has a correct policy of uniting intellectuals, so that revolutionary intellectuals and cadres and soldiers from worker and peasant backgrounds are well combined, with worker and peasant cadres and soldiers becoming knowledgeable and intellectuals becoming workers and peasants. Second, our army, in conjunction with the needs of the masses, seizes the gaps between battles to build a set of cultural work and mass cultural life. Therefore, after twenty-two years of arduous war, our army has produced a large number of leading backbones of worker and peasant origin who are both civil and military, and the general cadres and soldiers have also increased their cultural knowledge with the increase of military service.
    Past achievements have provided us with two important experiences: First, as long as we make cadres and soldiers realize that ignorance is brought about by the system of class oppression, once their class hatred is aroused, their consciousness of learning culture will be aroused. This is the foundation of the mass line of cultural education. Secondly, on the basis of this consciousness, there must be a series of organizational work, implementing teaching each other, self-study and mutual assistance, carrying out mass learning movements of officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers, combining with the needs of the masses, and constantly improving the cultural level through newspapers, wall newspapers, and company performances.
    Speaking of it today, we still need to absorb these experiences. To create a continuous upsurge of learning culture, we must do so. The difference is that the learning environment and conditions are better than in the past. The war in North China has ended, and the troops have time for long-term rectification and training. The location is relatively concentrated, and the objects are relatively fixed, which enables us to and must strengthen the planning of cultural education, eliminate illiteracy and semi-literacy step by step, and improve the cultural level of cadres and soldiers step by step. That is to say, we must replace the intermittent and irregular learning habits with a regular learning system; replace the self-flowing phenomenon of grabbing a handful of this and a handful of that with certain requirements in a certain period; and replace the laissez-faire attitude of completely listening to so-called mass voluntarism with inspiring consciousness as the main thing, supplemented by organizational supervision.
    However, the experiences of empiricism and guerrilla tactics often hinder the implementation of formal education. Some comrades are not used to making long-term plans, thinking that everything must be learned, and that cultural learning is a circuitous route that cannot produce immediate results. Therefore, they put cultural learning in an unimportant position. For example, in the spare-time school, there is a subject of arithmetic. Many comrades think that learning Chinese can be applied, but what is the use of learning arithmetic? They do not realize that arithmetic and mathematics are the basic courses of natural science and are necessary for building a modern national defense army. For example, some comrades one-sidedly believe that only teaching what the masses need in front of them is the mass line, while neglecting to think about the long-term needs of the masses. These deviations in understanding of cultural learning are contrary to the current education policy and must be corrected.
    Of course, the task of army cultural construction is arduous. Although the environment and conditions are better than in the past, there are still many difficulties, such as the lack of cultural education cadres and textbooks suitable for the army, the lack of new formal education experience, etc., as Chairman Mao said in 'On the People's Democratic Dictatorship': 'Some of the things we are familiar with are about to become idle, and the things we are not familiar with are forcing us to do. This is the difficulty.' But this difficulty can be overcome and must be gradually overcome. As long as we can humbly learn and research, not stick to the old ways and be satisfied with the existing experience, attach importance to this work, and systematically cultivate specialized cadres for cultural education, concentrate on good experience and persist in it, then we have the confidence to do this work well."

### 搞好文化学习　华北解放军报发表社论

　　搞好文化学习
  　华北解放军报发表社论
    中国人民解放军华北军区政治部机关报“华北解放军”报，于本月十三日以“搞好文化学习”为题，发表社论。该社论指出：“学习文化，是我们当前建军的重要内容之一。学习文化之所以重要，因为文化是提高军事政治的一把钥匙，掌握了这把钥匙，才能使我们踏进政治理论和军事科学的宝库，从里面取得武器来武装自己。否则，我们进一步的提高，就将受到很大的局限性。学习文化之所以重要，还因为我们大多数同志，由于在旧社会中遭受压迫，没有学习文化的机会；参加革命以后，虽然因为领导上的重视和个人的努力，获得了一些文化知识，但长期紧张残酷的战争环境，使我们的学习受到一定限制，一般说来，我们文化水平是低的，因此当进入正规建军的时候，有学习文化的迫切需要。
    我们军队是有文化的军队，从来就是重视文化的。把文化工作，看成是提高政治觉悟、提高战斗力的不可缺少的工作，是政治工作的重要内容之一。这表现在：第一、我们军队注意吸收革命知识分子到军队里来，有着团结知识分子的正确政策，使革命知识分子与工农出身的干部战士很好的结合，工农出身干部战士知识化，知识分子工农化。第二、我们军队结合群众需要，抓紧战斗间隙，建设了一套文化工作和群众性的文化生活。因此我们军队，经过二十二年的艰苦战争，涌现了一大批工农出身而文武双全的领导骨干，一般的干部战士，也随着军龄的增加，增长着文化知识。
    过去的成就，向我们提供了两条重要的经验：首先就是，只要我们使干部战士认识愚昧是阶级压迫制度带来的，一旦启发了他们的阶级仇恨，就启发了他们学习文化的自觉。这是文化教育群众路线的基础。其次就是，在这个觉悟基础之上，要有一系列的组织工作，实行教学相长、自学互助，开展官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵的群众性的学习运动，结合群众需要，通过报纸墙报和连队演唱，不断提高文化水平。
    在今天说起来，依然要吸取这些经验，要造成学习文化的不断高涨的热潮，必须这样做。所不同的，是学习的环境和条件比较过去好，华北战争结束了，部队有长期整训的时间，驻地的比较集中，对象的相对固定，使我们可能并且必须加强文化教育的计划性，有步骤的消灭文盲半文盲，按步就班的提高干部战士的文化水平。这就是说，我们要以经常的正规的学习制度，来代替时紧时松一曝十寒的学习习惯；以一定时期有一定的要求，代替东抓一把西抓一把的自流现象；以启发自觉为主，辅之以组织上的督促，代替完全听从所谓群众自愿的放任态度。
    但是学习中的经验主义和游击作风，常常障碍着正规教育实施，有些同志不习惯作长远打算，认为样样都要学习，而文化学习是迂远的不能立收成效的，因此就把文化学习放在不重要的地位。如工余补习学校中有算术一门，有不少同志就认为学国文可以应用，学算术作什么？没有认识算术数学是自然科学的基础课程，是建设现代化国防军所必需。又如有的同志片面的认为，只有群众眼前需要什么就教什么，才是群众路线，而忽略了为群众远大的需要着想。这些对于文化学习认识上的偏差，是与当前教育方针相抵触的，必须进行纠正。
    当然，军队文化建设的任务是艰巨的，虽然环境条件比过去好，但仍存在着许多困难，缺乏文化教育干部与适合军队的教材，缺乏新的正规教育的经验等等，正如毛主席在‘论人民民主专政’中所说：‘我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西正在强迫我们去做。这就是困难。’但是这个困难是可以克服的，也必须逐步加以克服。只要我们能够虚心的学习研究，不固步自封满足既有的经验，重视这一工作并有步骤的培养文化教育的专门干部，集中好的经验坚持下去，那我们有信心把这一工作搞好。”
