Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 3rd – TASS, London, 1st: British newspapers are prominently reporting the arrival of the U.S. Chiefs of Staff in Europe. Judging from the newspaper reports, their mission is to force Western European countries to submit to the overall strategic plan of the United States as outlined by the North Atlantic Treaty.

    The Sunday Express's editorial expressed alarm at the suggestions brought by the American military chiefs. Other newspapers also seem to show signs of the same alarm, though not as frankly. The Sunday Express stated that the result of implementing the American war plan for Britain and British men and women would be "frightful, if not disastrous." The newspaper continued: "War is not inevitable. War can be avoided, can be prevented, if we clear their minds of that misconception, peace can be maintained."

    The Washington correspondent of the Observer spoke of the financial pressure the U.S. Chiefs of Staff might bring to bear on Britain and Western European countries, stating: Unless the Chiefs of Staff can report back within ten days that the Western European countries' military plans include plans for immediate submission to American "unified" action, the $1.45 billion armed aid plan is unlikely to be approved. The American generals traveling to Europe have been instructed to inform the military leaders of Britain, France, and other Western European countries of this fact in the strongest possible terms. U.S. Ambassador to London, Douglas, has been asked to warn the British government that there must be a truly unified and active demonstration of a European strategic plan. The same warnings appear to be being made in other North Atlantic Treaty capitals. The Observer's author pointed out that the newly appointed British Air Chief Marshal, Sir John Slessor, vehemently opposed the American plan to limit the role of Western European countries to providers of cannon fodder.

    英报评战贩赴欧阴谋
    图强迫西欧听命美帝
    【新华社北平三日电】塔斯社伦敦一日讯：英报以显著地位报道美国参谋长的抵欧。根据报纸的报道判断，他们的任务是强迫西欧国家屈服于按照北大西洋公约所制出的美国全面战略计划。
    星期快报的社论对美国军事首脑们带来的建议表示惊惧。其他报纸似乎也有同样的惊惧迹象，虽然没有那么坦白地表示。星期快报称：对于英国和英国男女来说，实现美国战争计划的结果：将是“令人骇怕的，如果不是灾难性的话”。该报继称：“战争并不是不可避免的。战争是能够避免，能够防止的，如果我们清除了他们脑筋中的那种错误观念的话，和平是能够保持的。”
    观察家报华盛顿记者谈及美国参谋长可能加诸英国和西欧国家的财政压力称：除非参谋长们能在十天中回报说：西欧国家的军事计划包括有立即屈服于美国的行动“统一”的计划，否则十四亿五千万美元的武装援助计划就没有批准的可能。赴欧的美国将军们，曾接到训令要用可能的最强烈的措词，把这一事实通知英、法和其他西欧国家的军事领袖。美驻伦敦大使道格拉斯曾被要求向英国政府提出警告，说必须有欧洲战略计划真正统一的积极表现。在其他北大西洋公约国家的首都，同样的警告看来也会提出。观察家报作者指出，方才宣布任命的英国空军参谋长斯莱塞空军上将，猛烈反对把西欧国家的角色限制为炮灰供给者的美国计划。
