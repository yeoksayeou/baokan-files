    Students of the First Division of North China University Recognize the Greatness of the Working People in the Reports of Farmer Representatives
    Gu Jin
    One drizzly evening, the students of the seventh and eighth detachments of the First Division of North China University gathered on time in the large classroom of Cotton Alley. The more than two thousand students present, although more or less hiding their curiosity, all held a great hope: to take this opportunity to meet the farmer representatives participating in the preparatory meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference and listen to their speeches. They were just afraid that the heavy rain would hinder the grand meeting today.
    Suddenly, a burst of applause erupted, and all eyes were welcoming the five farmer representatives as they stepped onto the stage.
    The first to speak was Zhu Fusheng from Shandong. He spoke about his own experiences: how he organized a militia guerrilla group in the early days of the War of Resistance against Japan, and how he later led a working team to work in the enemy-occupied areas. In the autumn and winter of last year, he also participated in the famous Huaihai Campaign as a political commissar of a migrant worker brigade. These touching deeds, told from the mouths of our own heroes, were so thrilling! When he talked about being captured, beaten with a wooden stick as thick as a bowl, hung up and "flown" by the enemy, and having a gas cylinder filled with water seven times, but he was still unyielding and would rather die than give up the other eighteen guerrilla brothers, the students' hearts suddenly became heavy. When he described how he fought the enemy in court, the thoughts of more than two thousand people in the audience were also fighting. Just like what a student in the eighty-first detachment, who usually didn't listen carefully in class, couldn't help but say after listening: "It's really touching! My thoughts are always fighting, and I feel too small!" Some students, in turn, used such a strong revolutionary quality to measure themselves: "If I were there at that time, would I waver?" When he talked about how he used his wit to escape with the help of the guerrillas, everyone's once tense mood felt relieved, and the whole audience raised their heads and gave him enthusiastic applause. He sadly told everyone that at the beginning, ten of the twelve comrades in the guerrilla group had sacrificed one after another, and now only two of them were left, including him. This is equivalent to telling the students: "Who insisted on resisting Japan behind enemy lines?" "The victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan was bought with the blood of the working people!" No wonder the students had new understandings in general when listening to the report and afterward. They said: "In the past, we were deceived by Chiang Kai-shek, and always thought that the War of Resistance was led by the Kuomintang. Today, we clearly realize that it was led by the Communist Party, and it was the merit of the working people!" At this time, countless slips of paper flew to the stage like snowflakes, with the following written on them: "Farmers can fight and sacrifice for the people and the motherland like this. What reason do we intellectuals have to despise them!" "Today's report is really touching. The working people in the liberated areas are so great!"....
    The second to step up to the microphone was Li Xiuzhen, a forty-nine-year-old heroine who was recently elected as a Standing Committee member of the National Women's Federation. Based on her own experience, she summarized how millions of working women in the liberated areas fought against the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang in hardship, and how they sent their sons and husbands to join their own ranks to actively support the front lines. This old woman, who had been beaten and abused in wealthy people's homes and had worked as a maid for nine years, risked her life in the Jilu-Yu Anti-Japanese War to do intelligence work for the Eighth Route Army, climbing mountains and wading through rivers, transporting bullets for our army day and night, moving many comrades to tears. Some students in the seventy-seventh detachment expressed such written thoughts on the spot: "After listening to your report, I felt the greatness of the working people who fought against the enemy under the leadership of the Communist Party! You are so simple and hardworking, so resolute and brave; at the same time, I feel my own insignificance and uselessness. We have studied for a few days, what's so great about that, it's simply not comparable to you!" When everyone heard that she was caught by the enemy, the whole audience was sweating for her past danger. No matter how the enemy threatened or lured her, she was unyielding and never said the name of a single comrade, never revealed the slightest military information, and scolded the enemy puppets, saying: "My son joined the People's Liberation Army. If you want to beat him, beat him. If you want to kill him, kill him!" She realized that "If our troops are exposed, they will be wiped out by the enemy. It doesn't matter if I die alone." This kind of boldness, generated by a high degree of political consciousness, powerfully educated the entire audience. In countless slips of paper, some expressed that they wanted to learn from her: "I feel very ashamed! We have been studying for so long, and we are not as good as a rural female comrade. I am determined to learn from this female comrade, to learn this spirit of resolute revolution, not afraid of sacrifice, not afraid of difficulties, and brave struggle!" Some regretted that they were taught by her too late: "Old lady: We are so sorry! If you had given us a report earlier, our position would have been more firm." When it was said that in order to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, that bad thing, she had sent her beloved child to join the army, and unfortunately, in the twelfth lunar month of 1947, her son gloriously sacrificed for the cause of the people's liberation, everyone in the audience felt sad for her, but she said: "Revolution requires not being afraid of hardship, not being afraid of difficulties, and not being afraid of sacrifice!" Then she said: "In the revolutionary ranks, my own son sacrificed, and everyone takes care of me as if I have a son!" In this way, the whole audience woke up from their dreams again. A comrade from the eighty-fifth detachment wrote: "After listening to your speech, I felt as if I had woken up from a dream, which made me understand your greatness and your spirit of self-sacrifice. You are the best mother in the country. I want to learn from you, I want to be your loyal children, be the children of your vast working people, I will dedicate my whole life to the revolution, to the working people, to avenge the martyrs! Dear old Comrade Li, your great spirit will exist in the world forever." Her words made every female student complain that their position was not as firm as the old lady's. This is what a student from the eighty-fifth detachment said: "Old lady, I was very moved after listening to your report! In the past, I didn't think that women like you, old lady, would send their own children to the revolution, and they themselves would not be afraid of all kinds of hardships and difficulties to do intelligence work. ... You solved the problem for me, I am very grateful to the old lady, I pay my respects to the old lady here! In the future, I will learn from the old lady, the old lady is my good teacher! After graduation, I will wholeheartedly serve the people, stand on the side of the proletariat, and respond to the old lady's report today with my future work!" In the continuous applause, the old lady raised one of her small feet and said angrily: "If I had been born fifteen years later, with big feet, I would definitely join the army and go south to fight to Taiwan and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!" The non-stop applause erupted again, and countless slips of paper flew to the stage: "Old lady, I will definitely fight to Taiwan and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive. I will definitely avenge your dead son; not only your son, but also all the dead martyrs... I will definitely go to the south of the Yangtze River to achieve your wishes and goals. Old lady! We are all your children." Some students even seemed to have forgotten themselves, and were so excited and angry that they wanted to jump up and leave for the south immediately.
    The old lady's report stirred up the enthusiasm of the entire meeting. Students wrote notes one after another requesting the leaders on the stage to shout slogans, so the majestic and loud slogans such as "Salute to the farmer representatives!" "Long live the liberation of the working people!" "Long live the liberation of Chinese women!" "Long live the liberation of all China!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" resounded through the clouds.
    Shi Zhenming, a production hero from the Taiyue area, spoke. He first said that the farmers in the Taiyue area, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, not only defeated the Japanese devils, but also defeated the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan bandit troops, and also developed production, so that the vast number of poor farmers who ate white soil, bran cakes, and leaves also improved their lives. He said: "After Japan surrendered, the old farmers all ran around telling each other: If you want to be liberated, unless the mountain falls and the stone rots. (The mountain falling means overthrowing Yan Xishan, and the stone rotting means eliminating Chiang Kai-shek.) Now they have all come true one by one. I, an old man who begged for food and fled famine in the old society, have also become a hero and a representative. All this is thanks to Chairman Mao's good leadership." In particular, his hearty and joyful laughter infected the happy mood of the liberated farmers to the whole audience like an electric current. The audience couldn't help but be excited with him, laugh with him, and applaud him warmly. After comparing the past and present situations in their village in detail with concrete facts and figures, he also emphasized to everyone: "A village that had been looted several times by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits was fortunate to have Chairman Mao's idea, and implemented land reform, which turned the whole village's farmers over, and they had land to cultivate. Everyone united to help each other in production. By last year, the average person could harvest more than six stone of coarse grains (Note: In the local area, four stone of coarse grains per person per year is enough for life), and each person raised three chickens and two families raised one pig. In the past, farmers were too poor to light lamps, but now they have oil to light lamps." The old hero also talked about the cultural liberation of the old farmers: he started from the civil affairs primary school, ran winter schools, ran women's night schools, and went all the way to running higher primary schools. He himself said: "Don't look at me, I don't know a few bags of big characters, but I am still the principal of a higher primary school!" ... These words naturally made the audience reveal their love for the Communist Party from the bottom of their hearts.
    The reports of the farmer representatives were like a vivid movie, showing the process of the working people in the liberated areas resolutely fighting against imperialism, feudal landlords, and the Kuomintang reactionary bandits for a long time, and the picture of farmers carrying out production struggles under the leadership of the Communist Party to improve their lives, one by one in front of the students. It was both exciting and moving, and also aroused a lot of regret and shame. The most important thing was that it made the students realize the greatness of the working people, increased their ambition, and increased their confidence in the revolution. Some comrades who had never applauded when listening to reports in the past also applauded enthusiastically this time. The note from the tenth group of the seventy-sixth detachment wrote very clearly: "Five fathers and mothers: We intellectuals should sincerely and truly learn from and follow your reports. After we graduate, whether we go to the countryside or south, we will never forget this day, July 12, 1949, and we will never forget your final earnest words: Farmers are willing to unite with workers, intellectuals, and the liberal bourgeoisie under the leadership of the Communist Party to completely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek and carry out the revolution to the end!" The first group of the seventy-eighth detachment expressed: "Dear heroes: Your speeches today are educating us, leading us, and encouraging us! We feel refreshed after listening to your reports, and the blood in our whole body is boiling. We are determined to learn from you, and we will definitely go south after graduation, fight to Taiwan, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and strive for the complete liberation of China!"
    Today's grand meeting is a group of intellectuals who are being transformed here, recognizing their parents and acknowledging their teachers. The idea of looking down on the working people in the past has begun to be swept away. Because it was too late, two representatives, Liu Yuhou and others, did not speak, and everyone felt dissatisfied. In the end, they sang "Unity is Strength" and "Turning Over Tune" from the bottom of their hearts, and used songs and waving hands to reluctantly send off their parents and teachers.

    向劳动人民学习！
    认父母、拜老师
    华北大学一部同学在农民代表报告中认识了劳动人民的伟大
    古今
    一个细雨蒙蒙的傍晚，华大一部，七、八区队的同学，按时在棉花胡同的大课堂集合了。到场的两千多个同学，虽然或多或少隐藏着好奇心，但都抱着一个很大的希望，想趁此机会见一见参加新政协筹备会的农民代表，听一听他们讲话；心里就怕雨下大了，会阻碍今天这次见面的盛会。
    忽然爆发了一阵掌声，所有的眼睛，都在目迎五位农民代表步上讲台。
    第一个讲话的，是山东的朱富胜。他讲的是自己亲身的经过，是他在抗战初期如何组织民兵游击小组，后来又如何带领武工队到敌占区工作；去年秋冬，他又以民工大队政委的资格，参加了名震中外的淮海战役。这些可歌可泣的事迹，从我们英雄自己的口中讲出，是多么令人惊心动魄啊！当他讲到自己被俘，敌人用碗口大的木棒打，吊起来“飞”，使汽筒灌了七次水，而他还是不屈不挠，死也不供出其他十八个游击弟兄的时候，同学们心头顿时沉重起来。当他讲述在法庭上如何与敌人斗争时，台下两千多人的思想也交起战来了。正如八十一队一个平时不好好听课的同学，听了也忍不住说的一样：“真感动人！我思想老斗争，觉得自己太渺小！”一部分同学，则用这样坚强的革命品质反过来衡量自己：“假如我在那时，是不是会动摇？”谈到他如何使用机智，在游击队的援助下脱险时，每个人一度紧张的心情才觉轻松起来，全场昂起头，报以狂热的鼓掌。他沉痛的告诉大家，开始时，游击小组的十二个战友，前后牺牲了十名，到如今连他只剩两人了。这就等于告诉同学们：“谁在敌后坚持抗日？”“抗日战争的胜利，是劳动人民用鲜血换来的呀！”无怪乎同学们在听报告时及以后，普遍都有了新的认识。他们说：“过去受蒋介石的欺骗，老认为抗战是国民党领导的，今天才明确地认识了是共产党领导的，是劳动人民的功劳！”这时，无数的纸条子，雪片般的向台上飞去，上面写的是：“农民能够这样为人民为祖国而奋斗牺牲，我们知识分子有什么理由轻视他们！”“今天的报告实在是太感动人了，解放区的劳动人民太伟大了！”……。
    第二个走到扩音器前去的，是不久以前被选为全国妇联常务委员，今年四十九岁的女英雄李秀贞。她以自己亲身的经历，概括的叙述了解放区千百万的劳动妇女，是怎样在艰苦中与日寇及国民党作斗争，又是怎样的送子送郎参加自己的队伍，积极支援前线的。这个在富人家里挨打受气，曾经当过九年女仆的老婆婆，在冀鲁豫抗日战争中，出生入死的为八路军做情报工作，爬山涉水，不分昼夜的为我军运送子弹，感动得好些同志蹩不住掉了眼泪。七十七队有的同学就当场发表了这样的书面感想：“我听了你的报告，感到你们在共产党领导下与敌人作斗争的劳动人民的伟大！你们是那么的朴实艰苦，那么的坚决勇敢；同时我又感到自己的渺小与不中用。我们念过几天书，有什么了不起，那简直不能与你们相比！”大家听到她被敌人抓住时，全场都为她这过去的危险捏了一把冷汗。不管敌人怎样威胁利诱，她却坚贞不屈，始终没说出一个同志的姓名，始终没暴露半点军情，并痛骂敌伪，说：“我儿子就是参加了解放军，你要打就打，要杀就杀！”她认识得到：“暴露了我们的队伍，就会被敌人一网打尽，死自己一个人倒不要紧。”这种由高度的政治觉悟产生的豪气，有力的教育了全场听众。在无数纸条中，有的表示要向她学习：“我觉得很惭愧！我们学习了这么多日子啦，还不如一位乡间的女同志。我决心要跟这位女同志学，学这种坚决革命、不怕牺牲、不怕困难、勇敢斗争的精神！”有的悔恨受她的教导太晚：“老大娘：我们太遗憾了！假如你早些给我们做报告，我们的立场就更坚定了。”当说到为了打蒋介石那个坏东西，她曾经送出心爱的孩子去参了军，不幸在一九四七年腊月，她的儿子就为人民的解放事业光荣牺牲时，全场的人都在为她难受，她却说：“革命就要不怕艰苦，不怕困难，不怕牺牲！”接着又说：“在革命队伍中，自己的儿子牺牲了，大家照顾我，就跟有儿子一样！”这样，使得全场又从睡梦中醒过来。八十五队一个同志写道：“我听了你的讲话，就如同从梦中醒过来似的，使我了解了你们的伟大，你们的自我牺牲精神。你是我们全国最好的母亲。我要向你学习，我要做你忠诚的儿女，做你们广大劳动人民的儿女，我把整个的生命都献给革命，献给劳动人民，为先烈们复仇！亲爱的李老同志，你的这种伟大精神将要永远存在于世界上。”她的话语，使每个女同学都埋怨自己为什么立场不如老大娘站的稳。八十五队一个同学就是这样说的：“老大娘，我听了你的报告，使我非常感动！在从前，我认为妇女没有象大娘这样的，将自己亲生的儿女送给革命，而自己也不怕千辛万苦，不怕一切困难去做情报工作。……你给我解决了问题，我非常感谢大娘，我在这里向大娘致敬！以后我要跟老大娘学，老大娘是我的好老师！毕业后，我要全心全意的为人民服务，站在无产阶级方面，以将来的工作答复老大娘今天的报告！”在不断的掌声中，老大娘翘起一只小脚来，愤恨的说道：“要是我晚生十五年，有一只大脚，我一定要参加队伍南下，打到台湾去，活捉蒋介石！”不停息的鼓掌声又爆发了，无数的纸条飞上了讲台：“大娘，我一定要打到台湾去，活捉蒋介石。我一定要为你死去的儿子复仇；不但是你的儿子，一定要为所有死去的烈士复仇……我一定要下江南，达到你的志愿与目的。大娘！我们都是你的儿女。”有的同学，甚至似乎忘记了自己，又兴奋，又愤恨，当时就想蹦起来，非立刻南下不行。
    老大娘的报告，激荡了全会场的热情。同学们纷纷写条要求台上领导喊口号，于是“向农民代表致敬！”“劳动人民解放万岁！”“中国妇女解放万岁！”“全中国解放万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”等雄壮而响亮的口号声响彻云霄。
    太岳区的生产老英雄石振明讲话，他首先说太岳区的农民在共产党、毛主席领导下，不但打败了日本鬼子，又打败了蒋阎匪军，同时还发展了生产；使广大吃白土、糠饼、树叶的贫苦农民，也改善了生活。他说：“日本投降以后，老农民都奔走相告：若要解放把身翻，除非是山倒石头烂。（山倒即打倒阎锡山，石头烂意指消灭蒋介石。）如今都一件一件的应了。我这个在旧社会要饭逃荒的老汉，也当了英雄，当了代表，这全是毛主席的好领导。”特别是他那爽朗愉快的笑声，把翻身农民的快活心情，象电流一样传染给了全场，听众不由得跟着他兴奋，跟着他欢笑，为他热烈的鼓掌。他把他们村上过去与现在的情形，用具体的事实和数字详细比较以后，还着重告诉大家：“被日寇与蒋阎匪几次洗劫过的一个村子，多亏毛主席给出主意，实行了土地改革，使全村农民翻了身，有了地种，大家团结起来互助生产，到去年平均每人可收六石多粗粮（注：当地生活每人一年有四石粗粮就足够了），每人养了三只鸡，两家一口猪；过去农民穷得点不起灯，如今也有油点灯了。老英雄还谈到了老农民的文化翻身：他从民办小学开始，办冬学，办妇女夜校，一直到办高小。他自己说：“别看我斗大的字不识几布袋，还是个高小校长咧！”……这些话自然而然的使听众从心底里流露出对共产党的爱戴。
    农民代表的报告，就象一部有声有色的电影，把解放区劳动人民，长期与帝国主义、封建地主、国民党反动匪帮坚决斗争的过程，和农民在共产党领导下进行生产斗争，达到改善生活的图景，一一在同学们面前放映了一遍。又令人兴奋，又令人感动，还引起了不少的悔恨和羞惭，特别重要的是使同学们认识了劳动人民的伟大，长了自己的志气，增加了革命的信心。个别同志过去听报告，从来未鼓过掌，这次也不由自主地狂热地鼓掌了。七十六队十组的条子就写得很明白：“五位父、母亲大人：您们几位的报告，我们知识分子应该真心真意的学习和效法。我们毕业后，无论到农村或南下，绝对忘不了一九四九年七月十二这一天，忘不了您们最后谆谆告诉的话：农民愿意在共产党的领导下，和工人、知识分子自由资产阶级团结一致，彻底消灭蒋介石，把革命进行到底！”七十八队一组则表示：“亲爱的英雄们：你们今天的讲话，在教育着我们，在领导着我们，在鼓舞着我们！我们听得了你们的报告，浑身都清爽了，全身的血液在翻滚。我们决心要向你们学习，毕业后一定南下，打到台湾去，活捉蒋介石，争取全中国彻底解放！”
    今天的盛会，就是一群正在改造中的知识分子，在这里认了父母，拜了老师，过去看不起劳动人民的思想开始为之一扫。因为时间太晚，刘玉厚等两个代表没有讲话，大家都感到不满足。最后，他们从内心里唱出了“团结就是力量”与“翻身小调”，用歌声和招手，恋恋不舍的送走了自己的父母和老师。
