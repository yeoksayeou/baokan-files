    Local Carpet Factory Groups Joint Marketing Cooperative
    Opening Sales Channels and Coordinating Raw Materials
    [Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Carpet Joint Marketing Cooperative was officially established yesterday (10th). The inaugural meeting was held at the Renli Factory at 4 pm. At the meeting, Chang Hanzhang reported on the purpose of the cooperative's establishment, which is to enable all factories to help each other, open up sales channels, coordinate raw materials, and work together to develop production. Then, Chen Ji, the head of the Industry and Mining Section of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau, spoke, saying: The scale of the carpet industry in this city is not large, and in general, due to the small scale of production, finished products cannot be sold, which affects the flexibility of capital turnover. Therefore, it is necessary to organize mutual assistance so that production and sales can take the initiative. At the same time, everyone should come up with ideas and find ways to overcome the difficulties in transportation and sales. It is not enough to rely solely on government support. Finally, he hoped that everyone, in the initial organization of mutual assistance, in the case of inconsistent demands from various factories, must resolve any possible problems with a spirit of serving the industry. At present, it is marketing mutual assistance, and it is hoped that it can develop into production mutual assistance in the future. Therefore, colleagues in the industry should always maintain close contact so that this organization can be consolidated. After that, representatives from the Bank of China and the Municipal Trading Company also spoke. The meeting then moved to the election, electing nine executive members, one of whom was the director member, and also produced general and deputy managers to preside over the cooperative's business.

    各地毯工厂组联合运销社
    打开销路统筹原料
    【本报讯】北平市地毯联合运销互助社于昨（十）日正式成立，下午四时，在仁立工厂开成立大会，会上由常翰章报告该社成立的目的，是为了各厂通力互助，打通销路和统筹原料，共同为发展生产而努力。接着北平市人民政府工商局工矿科科长陈纪讲话，他说：本市地毯业规模都不大，一般因力量小，成品无法推销，影响资金周转的灵活，因此，需要组织互助，使生产成品推销上能起主动作用。同时，要大家自动的出主意，想办法来克服运销上的困难，单靠政府的扶助是不够的。最后，他希望大家在最初组织互助时，在各个工厂的要求不一致的情况下，须以为同业服务的精神来解决可能发生的一些问题。目前是运销互助，希望将来能够发展为生产互助，因此同业之间要经常保持密切的联系，使这个机构能够巩固。之后，中国银行及市贸易公司到会代表亦先后讲话。会议即转入选举，选出常务社员九人，其中一人为主任社员，又产生了正副经理，主持互助社的业务。            （立）
