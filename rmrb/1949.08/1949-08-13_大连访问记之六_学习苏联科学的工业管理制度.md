    A Visit to Dalian, Part 6:
    Learning from the Soviet Union's Scientific Industrial Management System
    Zhao Wenmin, Zhang Pei
    There are many new things in Dalian, and particularly worthy of our study is the Soviet Union's advanced scientific factory management. In the factories we visited, the intense labor, rational production order, clean factory buildings, and various collective welfare facilities left a deep impression on us. Upon closer inquiry, we discovered a series of specific measures, like links in a chain, tightly connected. For example, the seven-level-based bonus and piece-rate wage system is rational and advanced, but implementing this wage system requires relatively complete production planning and cost accounting, which is the result of a complete set of scientific factory management.

    Generally speaking, factory management in Lushun-Dalian has gone through these steps: receiving, restoring production, implementing scientific management, setting production plans, cost accounting, changing to the new wage system, and signing collective contracts. However, this does not mean that there should be no planning when production is initially restored. On the contrary, planning and cost accounting should be established even if they are not accurate at the beginning, so that they can gradually become correct as factory management becomes more scientific. The aforementioned steps refer to the idea that leadership should focus on a specific area during a certain period and consciously lay the foundation for the next period, so that factory management gradually becomes enterprise-oriented.

    Reception must be as complete as possible, especially for charts and various production records, account books, and asset account books that are extremely important for production. These must be carefully preserved as one of the important bases for restoring production. Secondly, efforts should be made to keep all employees from scattering; even if the factory cannot be restored temporarily, efforts should be made to provide employees with living expenses; if some people really need to be dismissed, they should be registered in detail so that they can be found at any time when production is restored and people are needed. Furthermore, no matter how difficult the factory is, do not sell raw materials, otherwise it will cause great difficulties for the restoration of production.

    Based on the experience of Lushun-Dalian, the following five issues must be paid attention to in restoring production:

    1.  Restore production in a planned and step-by-step manner. Do not be misled by pleasant words such as "the first in East Asia" or "the first in Manchuria" and try to restore everything at once. Instead, focus on restoring production based on the needs of the country and the current subjective conditions.

    2.  Restore production based on the principle of self-reliance. Start production with existing raw materials, materials, machines (combined with dedicated equipment), and labor. Use the proceeds from selling part of the produced goods to pay temporary wages and buy raw materials. When production has just been restored and has not yet developed, workers should understand that excessively high wages will make the factory unable to bear the burden. The Party and the trade union should educate workers to understand that wages will increase with the development of production.

    3.  In terms of business management thinking, the direction of "production should make money" should be put forward. The general view that "production must lose money for a period of time when production is restored" is harmful. It should be pointed out that anything that has been restored to production should make money (except for the very short initial period); the temporary loss of money for the unproduced part is the state's investment in industry, and the temporary loss of money is precisely for future profits. Clearly separating these two situations in the minds of managers will enable the factory management to pay attention to enterprise from the beginning.

    4.  Do not abolish the past management system all at once, because establishing a new set of systems cannot be done in a short period of time. The unreasonable parts of the old system should be gradually reformed step by step and with preparation after careful consideration.

    5.  When the factory resumes production, do not rush into large-scale inventions and experiments, and do not easily turn large-scale industrial production into a laboratory, which will lead to production losses. The recruitment of workers should be based on the current production situation and the determination of labor organization. The practice of blindly recruiting workers is unacceptable.

    Once the factory is restored, attention must be paid to scientific management immediately, and various strict scientific management systems and serious and responsible work styles should be gradually established. At this time, it is necessary to overcome the rural handicraft work style of trying to save trouble and fearing trouble, and also to prevent formalism. The first impression of the several factories under the Sino-Soviet Far East Electric Power Company that we visited was that the tasks were clear, the division of labor was scientific, the connection between top and bottom was smooth, and the responsibilities were clear. The production tasks of the entire factory and each workshop group during a certain period (every quarter, month, or even week and day) are stipulated. These regulations have been discussed and approved by the employees in advance, so everyone knows the goal of struggle for this period and the tasks they should complete. In the labor process, a strict system of responsibility is implemented to strengthen the sense of responsibility of each employee, which also facilitates work inspection. The factory director's full energy is focused on reducing costs and exceeding tasks, and on this basis, he cares about improving the lives of workers. If the factory does well, the factory director has the right to submit a request to the higher authorities to reward his factory according to the prescribed methods, and the first and most rewarded person is often the factory director; if the factory does not do well, the factory director will be severely criticized or even punished by the higher management authorities. Strict economy is also the responsibility of the factory director. The gasoline stored in the Sino-Soviet joint venture paint warehouse evaporated naturally due to the long time it was stored, and the factory director was severely criticized by the higher authorities for this.

    There are the following main management systems in Dalian factories:

    Daily Record System (i.e., daily production records) - This is an important basis for the factory to implement scientific quota management. Without quotas, there will be no accurate cost plans and production plans. In the Soviet Union, because enterprise managers have rich experience in long-term familiarity with the production process and technology, they can easily obtain technical quotas, cost quotas, raw material quotas, and labor quotas. However, our technical and experience conditions are not yet available, so we must rely on the daily record system to gradually obtain more accurate quotas from the daily production records. Due to the high enthusiasm of employees, and the continuous improvement of technology, the quota is not forever fixed. In order to obtain the quota that has been improved, there also needs to be precise daily production records. In the workshops of several factories in Dalian, various production record figures are posted in each team, on each machine, and in the factory director's office. Some factories have special standardizers (labor technical standard measurers) who hold tables and record and study work such as work-hour classification, working day and labor time measurement during the production process. In the glass factory, every morning at eight o'clock, the relevant departments (such as the planning department or the production technology department) must submit the previous day's production progress report of the entire factory to the director's office. After the director arrives at the office, he must check the production records of the previous day. By recording and studying the production efficiency of machinery and manpower, labor organization, attendance and absenteeism rates, and the amount and consumption of raw materials every day, a preliminary fixed number can be obtained as the production quota, which serves as an important basis for formulating plans, calculating costs, and implementing the new wage system.

    Strict Accounting Independence - In Sino-Soviet joint ventures in Dalian, the head of the accounting department has high authority. He has his own vertical leadership, and the factory director has no power to promote or remove him. It is said that each month there is only a factory director's fund of 50,000 yuan (if production is good and costs are reduced significantly, the factory director's fund can be increased), which can be used by the factory director to issue notes for temporary emergency expenses. Other expenses cannot be allocated by the factory director. Even this 50,000 yuan must be used in relevant production or employee activities in accordance with accounting regulations. If the regulations are violated, the head of the accounting department can refuse to pay. If the factory director orders payment, the head of the accounting department has the right to report to his superiors to check the use of the funds. When higher authorities inspect a factory, they look at the records of the factory's accounting department to verify operating results.

    Fixed Asset Inventory - This is an important component of comprehensive scientific management. Without it, there is no way to talk about setting plans and calculating costs. However, strict registration and pricing of fixed assets is also very difficult, and it often takes several months or even more than a year to achieve. Here, it is necessary to overcome departmentalism, otherwise the valuation will be too low or too high, and both low and high valuations are harmful. The higher authorities have full power to transfer internal assets in Sino-Soviet joint ventures in Dalian, and there are general regulations for valuation.

    Strict Requisition System - After an item within the budget is obtained through several procedures from the production technology department, accounting department, and storage department, the original budget number is noted on the requisition form. When you exceed the quantity that should be received on a daily basis, someone will remind you or refuse to issue it. As for items outside the budget, they cannot be obtained unless you apply to the higher company for an additional budget.

    Labor Discipline (including going to and from work, requesting leave and reporting, etc.) - Labor discipline in the factory is universally followed from the factory director to the workers. Even if the deputy factory director is five minutes late, he will be criticized face-to-face by the factory director. There are certain strictly enforced regulations for workers' lateness and early departure. Some factories stipulate that being five minutes late will result in criticism, ten minutes late will result in half a day's wages being deducted, and being late several times will result in dismissal. Sino-Soviet enterprises regard the waste of working time as one of the biggest wastes. Production time is absolutely not allowed for meetings, including production meetings; but on the other hand, the prescribed holidays are guaranteed to be taken.

    Inspection System - This is also strict in various factories in Dalian. There are specialized institutions to carry out the inspection of finished products. Sometimes, finished products must be signed by several responsible personnel before they can be put into storage. The inspection of production is often the first thing the responsible person does after going to work. He first inspects all the workshops in the factory, and then handles other official business. Each production team or workshop holds a short meeting at the end of the day to review the day's work. A meeting is held once a week to inspect the production of the week and to carry out criticism and self-criticism.

    Reward and Punishment System - In Sino-Soviet joint ventures, in addition to the implementation of piece-rate and bonus rewards in terms of wages, general rewards are measured by production performance. It can be said that production performance is the only standard, and political conditions and learning cannot be used as the standard for rewards and punishments. In addition to rewarding workers, if the entire factory exceeds its task, the staff, first of all, the factory director, the Party committee secretary, and the chairman of the trade union, will receive material rewards (not just oral praise). All rewards are based on increasing production and reducing costs. Saving raw materials, inventions and creations, not asking for leave, etc., are all rewarded according to regulations; and those who fail to complete their tasks will have their wages deducted depending on the circumstances. Those who cause serious damage to the factory due to dereliction of duty will be sentenced to imprisonment.

    After the management system is initially established, generally speaking, the focus of administrative leadership should be placed on the production and technical departments, from the chief engineer, various technicians (mechanical, power), production and technical departments, and all technical personnel of the construction department to the workshop directors and team leaders. They are production commanders and should be given priority in strengthening their leadership.

    大连访问记之六
    学习苏联科学的工业管理制度
    赵文敏  张沛
    大连有很多新事物，其中特别值得我们学习的，是苏联先进的科学的工厂管理。在我们参观过的工厂中，那种紧张的劳动，合理的生产秩序，整洁的厂房和各种集体福利设备，给人以深刻印象。而当我们稍稍仔细打问后，就会发现一系列的具体措施，象好些环子一个紧扣着一个。比如以七级为基础的超额奖励和计件工资制，是合理的先进的，但实行这种工资制，必须要有比较完善的生产计划与成本计算，而这种完善的生产计划与成本计算，则又是整套工厂科学管理的结果。
    一般说来，旅大工厂管理上大体经过这样几个步骤：接收，恢复生产，实行科学化管理，订生产计划，成本计算，改行新工资制度，订立集体合同等。但这不是说在开始恢复生产时就可以无计划，相反，在开始生产时就应该有计划和成本计算等，哪怕不准确也要订定，以便随着工厂管理的逐渐科学化而逐渐正确。上述步骤是指领导思想上某一时期应有某一重点，并有意识地为下一时期打下基础，使工厂经营逐步企业化。
    接收必须尽可能完整，特别是对进行生产有极重要意义的图表和各种生产记录的台帐、资产台帐等，必须加意保存，以便作为恢复生产的重要根据之一。其次要尽可能使全体职工不散；即使工厂一时不能恢复，也要设法给职工发生活费；实在需要遣散一些人时也要详细登记，以便生产恢复需人时即能随时找回。再其次，工厂不管如何困难，千万不要出卖原材料，否则会给生产恢复造成极大困难。
    根据旅大的经验，在恢复生产中必须注意以下五个问题：
    一、要有计划有步骤地恢复生产。不要为有些人所说的“东亚第一”、“满洲第一”等好听词句所迷惑，百废俱举，样样都想恢复；而是要根据国家的需要和当前的主观条件，有重点地恢复。
    二、要根据自力更生的原则进行恢复生产。要以现有的原料、材料、机器（配合献纳器材）和人工开始生产，以出卖一部生产成品所得，支付临时工资及买原料。在刚刚恢复生产时，在生产未发展以前要使职工们明白，过高的工资将使工厂不胜负担；党和工会要教育工人了解：工资是随着生产发展而提高的。
    三、在企业经营思想上，应该提出“生产即应赚钱”的方向，那种笼统地认为“恢复生产时一定得赔一个时期”的看法是有害的。应该指出，凡是已经恢复生产的就应赚钱（除最初很短时间外）；对于未生产部分的暂时赔钱是国家对工业的投资，暂时的赔钱正是为了将来的赚钱。把这两种情况在经营者思想上明确分开，就能使得工厂经营一开始就注意企业化。
    四、不要一下子就废除掉过去的管理制度，因为从新建立一套制度不是短期所能办到的，对旧制度中不合理的部分，应该经过慎重考虑后，有步骤有准备地加以逐渐改革。
    五、工厂恢复生产时，先不要忙于大规模的发明试验，不要轻易把大规模的工业生产变成实验室，以致造成的生产上的损失。招收工人应按目前生产情况，确定劳动力组织，盲目招收工人的作法是要不得的。
    工厂一经恢复，必须立即注意进行科学管理，逐步建立起各种严格的科学管理制度和严肃负责的作风。这时既要克服图省事，怕麻烦的农村手工业工作作风，也要防止流于形式主义。我们参观过的中苏远东电业公司所属的几个工厂，首先一个印象是任务明确，分工科学，上下衔接，职责分明。全厂和各个车间小组在一定期间（每季每月甚至每周每天）的生产任务都有规定，这些规定事先经过职工们的讨论通过，因而每个人都知道这一时期的奋斗目标及自己应完成的任务。在劳动过程中又实行严格的专责制，加强每个职工的责任感，同时也便于检查工作。厂长的全副精力，是集中在降低成本，超过任务上，并在这个基础上关心改善工人生活。做得好，厂长有权利呈请上级按照规定办法奖励自己的工厂，而第一个受奖和受奖最多的往往就是厂长；做得不好，厂长要受到上级管理机关的严格批评以至处罚。严格节约也是厂长的责任。中苏合营的油漆仓库中存放的汽油，由于时间久自然挥发了一些，该厂厂长即因此受到上级机关的严厉批评。
    大连工厂中有以下几种主要的管理制度：
    日录制（即日常的生产记录）——这是工厂实施科学的定额管理的重要依据，没有定额，就不会有精确的成本计划和生产计划。在苏联，由于企业管理者有长期熟悉生产过程和技术的丰富经验，他们很容易得出技术定额、成本额定、原料材料定额及劳动力的定额，但我们的技术和经验等条件尚不具备，因而就必须依靠日录制，从每天的日常生产纪录中，逐渐求得比较准确的定额。由于职工劳动热忱的高涨，技术的不断改进，定额不是永远不变的。为了求得已经提高了的定额，也需要有精密的日常生产的纪录。在大连的好几个工厂的车间里，在每个小组每台机器上，在厂长的办公室里，都贴有各种不同的生产纪录的数字。有的工厂，有专门的标定员（劳动技术标准测定员）拿着表，在生产过程中，记录和研究工时分类、工作日与劳动时间测定等专门工作。在玻璃工厂，每天早晨八点钟有关的各科（如计划科或生产技术科）就必须把前一天全厂的生产进度表等，交到厂长室，厂长到办公室后，必须检查昨天的生产纪录。这样每天来记录、研究机械和人力的生产效能、劳动组织、出勤和欠勤率及原材料的使用量和消耗量，即可求得一初步定数，作为生产定额，以作为订计划、算成本和实行新工资制的重要依据。
    严格的会计独立制——在大连中苏合营的企业里，会计科长的权力很高，他有自己的垂直领导，厂长没有权力提升或撤换他。每个月据说只有五万元的厂长基金（如果生产搞得好，成本减低得多，厂长基金可以增加），可以由厂长批条子领取作临时的紧急机动费用，其它经费厂长无权支配。就是这五万元也必须按照会计条例用在有关生产或职工活动上，假使违反条例，会计科长可以拒绝支付，如厂长下令一定要支付，会计科长有权报告他的上级，来检查这项费用的用途。上级机关检查一个工厂，要看该厂会计部门的纪录，来核算经营成绩。
    固定资产盘存——这是全面科学管理中一个重要组成部分，没有它，那就谈不到订计划算成本。但是固定资产严格的登记作价，也是非常不容易的事，常常需要几个月甚至一年多的时间才能作到。这里必须克服本位主义思想，否则就会估价过低过高，而无论过低或过高都是有害的。大连中苏合营企业内部资财，上级是有全权调动的，估价也有一般的规定。
    严格的领取制度——一件预算内的东西，经过生产技术科、会计科、保管科几道手续领到后，在领物单上就注有原预算数字，当你超过按日应领数量时就会有人提醒你，或拒绝发给；至于预算之外的东西，除呈请上级公司批准追加预算外，是领不到的。
    劳动纪律（包括上下班，请假报告等）——工厂的劳动纪律是从厂长到工人都一律遵守。副厂长迟到五分钟，也要受到厂长的当面批评。对于工人的迟到早退，都有一定的严格执行的规定。有的工厂规定晚到五分钟受批评，十分钟扣当天工资一半，几次迟到就要受开除的处罚。中苏企业把劳动时间的浪费，看成是最大的浪费之一。生产时间绝对不容许开会，包括生产会议在内；但另一方面，规定的假日则保证一定放假。
    检查制度——这在大连各厂同样是严格的，有专门机构执行成品的检查工作，有时成品要经过几个负责人员的签字才能入库。对生产的检查，常是负责人上班后首先要做的事，他先到全厂各车间巡视一周，然后再处理其他公务。每一生产小组或车间，每日下班时用简短时间集会检讨一天工作。每周一次会议，检查本周的生产，并开展批评和自我批评。
    奖惩制度——中苏合营的企业对工人的奖励，除工资方面实行计件、超额奖励外，一般奖励都是以生产成绩为衡量标准的，或者可以说生产成绩是唯一标准，而政治条件、学习等则不能作为奖惩的标准。除对工人奖励外，如全厂超过任务，则工作人员首先是厂长、党委书记、工会主任受到物质奖励（不是单纯口头表扬）。一切奖励均从提高生产减低成本出发。节省原料，发明创造，不请假等等，均按规定予以奖励；而对完不成任务者则根据情形，有的要扣工资，如因忽视职守而使工厂蒙受严重损害者，则判处徒刑。
    当管理制度初步建立起来以后，一般说来，行政领导的重点应放在生产技术部门，从总工程师、各种技师（机械、动力）、生产技术科和修建科的一切技术人员到车间主任和组长。他们是生产指挥人员，应当首先加强对他们的领导。
