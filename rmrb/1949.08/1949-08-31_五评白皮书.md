Fifth Critique of the White Paper

　　In order to find a basis for aggression, Acheson repeated a great deal about "friendship," coupled with a great many "principles."

　　Acheson said: "The concern of the American people and government for China can be traced back to a very early period in our history. Despite the vast differences in distance and background that separate China and the United States, the religious, charitable, and cultural ties that bind the two nations have often strengthened American friendship toward China. This friendship can be proven by many years of facts, such as using the Boxer Indemnity to fund the education of Chinese students, the abolition of extraterritoriality during World War II, and wartime and post-war aid to China. This record proves that the United States has always maintained and continues to maintain various basic principles of its foreign policy toward China, including the Open Door Policy, respect for China's administrative and territorial integrity, and opposition to any foreign control over China."

　　Acheson lied to our faces, writing aggression as "friendship."

　　The history of American imperialism's aggression against China, from helping the British fight the Opium War in 1840 until being driven out of China by the Chinese people, should be written into a concise textbook to educate Chinese youth. The United States was one of the first countries to force China to grant extraterritoriality, as mentioned in the White Paper in the first Sino-American treaty, the Treaty of Wanghia in 1844. It was in this treaty that the United States, in addition to forcing China to accept the opening of five ports, also forced China to accept American missionaries. Compared to other imperialist countries, American imperialism paid more attention to spiritual aggression for a long time, extending from religious undertakings to charitable and cultural undertakings. According to some statistics, the total investment of American churches and charitable organizations in China amounted to 41.9 million US dollars. Among them, medical expenses accounted for 14.7 percent, education expenses accounted for 38.2 percent, and religious activity expenses accounted for 47.1 percent. Many of our famous schools, such as Yenching University, Peking Union Medical College, Huiwen School, St. John's University, Ginling College, Hsiang-Ya Medical College, Soochow University, and West China Union University, were all established by the United States. Leighton Stuart became famous for engaging in these undertakings, and thus became the ambassador to China. Acheson and his ilk know very well that the so-called "religious, charitable, and cultural ties that bind the two nations have often strengthened American friendship toward China" has a history. Counting from the signing of the treaty in 1844, the United States has painstakingly managed these undertakings for 105 years, supposedly all to "strengthen friendship."

　　Participating in the Eight-Nation Alliance to defeat China, forcing the Boxer Indemnity, and then using it to "fund the education of Chinese students" and engaging in spiritual aggression is also considered an expression of "friendship."

　　Extraterritoriality was "abolished," but the perpetrator of the Shen Chong rape case was declared innocent by the US Navy Department after returning to the United States. This is also considered an expression of "friendship."

　　"Wartime and post-war aid to China," according to the White Paper, was more than 4.5 billion US dollars, and according to our agency's statistics, it was 5.914 billion US dollars, helping Chiang Kai-shek kill millions of Chinese people, which is also considered an expression of "friendship."

　　All of the 109 years (counting from the Anglo-American cooperation in the Opium War in 1840) of "friendship" given to China by American imperialism, especially the great "friendship" of helping Chiang Kai-shek kill millions of Chinese people in recent years, were for one purpose: to "always maintain and continue to maintain various basic principles of its foreign policy toward China, including the Open Door Policy, respect for China's administrative and territorial integrity, and opposition to any foreign control over China."

　　Killing millions of Chinese people, not for anything else, first for the Open Door, second for respecting China's administrative and territorial integrity, and third for opposing any foreign control over China.

　　Now only a small area of Guangzhou, Taiwan, and other places still has its doors open to Acheson and his ilk, and the first sacred principle is "still maintained" there. In other places, such as Shanghai, it was originally seemingly open, but people used American warships and the cannons and shells loaded on them to lie horizontally or vertically there, implementing a very unholy principle: a port blockade.

　　Now only a small area of Guangzhou, Taiwan, and other places can still benefit from Acheson's second sacred principle, and "still maintain" their "integrity." The rest of the places are all unlucky, and the administration and territory are broken beyond recognition.

　　Now only the places in Guangzhou, Taiwan, and other places benefit from the third sacred principle, and have "opposed" "any foreign control," including American control, for Acheson and his ilk, so they are still controlled by the Chinese. The rest of the territory, it is tearful to say, is all over, and is controlled by foreigners, and the Chinese are all slaves. As for what foreign country it is, Acheson has not yet had time to point out when writing this, but the following will be clear, so there is no need to ask more questions.

　　Whether non-interference in China's internal affairs is considered a principle, Acheson did not say, probably not. That's the logic of the White Paper. After reading the full text of the White Paper's preface, this brilliant logic can be confirmed.

### 五评白皮书

　　五评白皮书
    为了寻找侵略的根据，艾奇逊重复的说了一大堆的“友谊”，加上一大堆“原则”。
    艾奇逊说：“美国人民与政府对中国的关切，可以在我们的历史上追溯到很远的时期。尽管距离及背景上的广泛差异把中国和美国隔开，但是结合两民族的宗教上慈善事业上以及文化上的联系，常使美国对中国的友谊加强。这种友谊是可以用许多年来的种种事实予以证明的，诸如利用庚子赔款供中国学生的教育费用，在第二次世界大战期内的废除治外法权，以及战时和战后的对华援助等。这个纪录证明，美国始终维持并且现在依然维持对华外交政策的各种基本原则，包括门户开放主义，尊重中国的行政和领土的完整，以及反对任何外国控制中国等”。
    艾奇逊当面撒谎，将侵略写成了“友谊”。
    美帝国主义侵略中国的历史，自从一八四○年帮助英国人打鸦片战争起，直到被中国人民轰出中国止，应当写一本简明扼要的教科书，教育中国的青年人。美国是最早强迫中国给与治外法权的国家之一，这即是白皮书上提到的中美两国有史以来第一次签订的一八四四年的望厦条约。就是在这个条约里，美国除了强迫中国接受五口通商等事而外，强迫中国接受美国人传教也是一条。美帝国主义比较其他帝国主义国家在很长时期内，更加注重精神侵略方面的活动，由宗教事业而推广到慈善事业和文化事业。据有人统计，美国教会及慈善机关在中国的投资，总额达四千一百九十万美元。其中，医药费占百分之十四点七，教育费占百分之三十八点二，宗教活动费占百分之四十七点一。我国许多有名的学校如燕京、协和、汇文、圣约翰、金陵、湘雅、东吴、华西等，都是美国设立的。司徒雷登就是从事这些事业出了名，因此做了驻华大使的。艾奇逊们心中有数，所谓“结合两民族的宗教上、慈善事业上以及文化上的联系，常使美国对中国的友谊加强”，是有来历的。从一八四四年订约时算起，美国在这些事业上处心积虑地经营了一百零五年，据说都是为了“加强友谊”。
    参加八国联军打败中国，迫出庚子赔款，又用之于“供中国学生的教育费用”，从事精神侵略也算一项“友谊”的表示。
    治外法权是“废除”了，沈崇强奸案的犯人回到美国后，却被美海军部宣判无罪释放。也算一项“友谊”的表示。
    “战时和战后的对华援助”，据白皮书说是四十五亿余美元，据本社统计是五十九亿一千四百余万美元，帮助蒋介石杀死几百万中国人，也算一项“友谊”的表示。
    所有一百零九年（从一八四○年英美合作的鸦片战争算起）美帝国主义给予中国的“友谊”，特别是最近数年帮助蒋介石杀死几百万中国人这一项伟大的“友谊”，都是为着一个目的，就是“始终维持并且现在依然维持对华各项外交政策的各项基本原则，包括门户开放主义，尊重中国的行政和领土的完整，以及反对任何外国控制中国等”。
    杀死几百万中国人，不为别的，第一为了门户开放，第二为了尊重中国行政和领土的完整，第三为了反对任何外国控制中国。
    现在只有广州、台湾等处一小片地方的门户还向艾奇逊们开放，第一个神圣原则在那里“依然维持”着。其余地方，譬如上海罢，本来好似开放的，被人用美国的军舰和军舰上所装的炮及炮弹在那里横躺或直躺着，实行了一条很不神圣的原则：门户封锁。
    现在只有广州、台湾等处一小片地方的行政和领土，还算叨了艾奇逊第二个神圣原则的光，“依然维持”住了它们的“完整”。其余地方，一概倒运，行政和领土都是破碎的不象样子了。
    现在只有广州、台湾等处地方，叨了第三个神圣原则的光，把“任何外国的控制”，连同美国的控制在内，都给艾奇逊们“反对”掉了，因此还被中国人控制着。其余的国土，说来要掉眼泪，一概完了，都给外国人控制住了，中国人统统当了奴隶。至于是什么外国，艾奇逊老爷行文至此，还没有来得及点出，下文自明，无须多问。
    不干涉中国内政，是否算一条原则，艾奇逊没有说，大概不算罢。白皮书的逻辑，就是这样。看完白皮书序言的全文，就可以证实这一项高明逻辑的。
