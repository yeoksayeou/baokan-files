    [This Municipality News] Since the Military Control Commission issued the proclamation on the registration of reactionary party and league members, the Outer Fifth Branch Bureau has actively planned and carried out publicity to mobilize registration. On the 24th, 25th, and 26th of last month, each police station held symposiums for neighborhood group leaders and mass meetings respectively, explaining the significance of registering reactionary party and league members, interpreting the contents of the proclamation, and calling on neighborhood group leaders to cooperate with the government in completing this major task. Since the registration work began on the 25th, fifty-nine people have been registered in seven days, including forty-four Kuomintang district branch committee members (two of whom were county party secretaries), fourteen members of the Three People's Principles Youth League (except for one deputy district team leader, the others were all squad leaders), and one district branch committee member of the Democratic Socialist Party. The registration work of the branch bureau has now been basically completed.

    外五区反动党团分子五十九人登记
    【本市讯】自军管会颁布反动党团分子登记的布告后，外五分局即积极计划并进行宣传动员登记。上月二十四、五、六三天各派出所分别举行闾组长座谈会和群众大会，说明了登记反动党团分子的意义，解释布告内容，号召闾组长协同政府完成这个重大工作。从二十五日登记工作开始以来，七天中已经登记了有五十九名，计国民党区分部委员四十四人（其中有两个是县党部书记长），三青团十四人（除一个区队副以外，其他都是分队长），民社党区支部委员一人。现该分局登记工作基本上已经完成。        （外五分局莫笛）
