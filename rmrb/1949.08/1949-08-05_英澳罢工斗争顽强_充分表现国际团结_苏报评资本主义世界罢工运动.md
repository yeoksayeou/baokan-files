Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th: Moscow dispatch: Soviet newspapers recently commented on the growing strike movement in capitalist countries. A *Labor News* observer wrote: A notable feature of many strikes is that they not only demonstrate the intensity and tenacity of their struggles, but also the spirit of their international solidarity. The observer cited the recent London dockworkers' strike as an example. This strike in solidarity with Canadian seamen powerfully demonstrated that British workers are not only prepared to protect their own interests, but also to defend the cause of international labor solidarity. The Labor government mobilized state organs to oppose the dockworkers: it issued martial law, and sent troops to the docks to disrupt the strike, using them to unload cargo from ships. The observer commented: However, this effort by the British ruling group has proved futile. Workers in Britain and all other countries are watching the struggle of the London workers with admiration. To express solidarity with the striking Canadian seamen and London dockworkers, dockworkers in Algiers also refused to unload British ships. Workers in Marseille and Dunkirk also expressed solidarity with the London dockworkers.

The *Labor News* observer also pointed out the strike of 24,000 Australian miners in recent weeks. This strike also illustrates that the influence of right-wing trade union leaders among workers is weakening. This strike was against the will of the right-wing leadership of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. At mass rallies held throughout Australia, workers unanimously passed resolutions demanding the repeal of the anti-labor law freezing trade union funds, and calling for a continued strike until the authorities release the imprisoned trade union leaders and meet the economic demands of the striking workers.

An editorial in *New Era* magazine, analyzing the strikes by London dockworkers and Australian miners, emphasized: These unwavering examples of the working class have aroused the anger of the Anglo-American reactionary camp. Attlee is spreading lies, insisting that British dockworkers are victims of a "Communist conspiracy." Australian Prime Minister Chifley is following in Attlee's footsteps. However, the hackneyed and tiresome anti-communist movement, in a clumsy attempt to cover up the increasingly acute social contradictions in capitalist countries that accompany the economic crisis by clamoring about a "Communist conspiracy," cannot convince the working masses. *New Era* magazine concluded that new evidence emerges every day to prove that the strength of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which embodies the best ideals of the labor movement, is growing. The establishment of the industrial departments of the World Federation of Trade Unions will be of practical help in promoting and expanding mutual support and international solidarity among workers.

    充分表现国际团结
    苏报评资本主义世界罢工运动
    【新华社北平四日电】莫斯科讯：苏联报纸顷评论资本主义国家内日益增长的罢工运动。劳动报观察家写道：许多罢工的显著特点，不仅是表现了他们斗争的激烈性与顽强性，而且也表现了他们的国际团结的精神。观察家举出了最近伦敦码头工人的罢工作为例证。这一声援加拿大海员的同盟罢工，强有力地显示了英国工人不仅准备保护他们本身的利益，而且也准备保卫劳动人民的国际团结事业。工党政府动员了国家机关来反对码头工人：它颁布了戒严令，并派军队到码头上，破坏罢工，利用他们起卸船上的货物。观察家评称：然而，英国统治集团的这种努力已证明是徒劳的。英国和其他一切国家的工人们，都以钦佩的目光注视着伦敦工人的斗争。为了表示与正在罢工的加拿大海员和伦敦码头工人团结一致，阿尔及尔的码头工人也拒绝给英国船只卸货。马赛与敦刻尔刻的工人，也表示与伦敦码头工人团结一致。
    劳动报观察家又指出最近几星期的大罢工事件中两万四千澳大利亚矿工的罢工。这一罢工也说明了右翼职工会领袖在工人中的影响正在削弱。这一罢工，是与澳大利亚职工会联合会右翼领导机构的意志相背驰的。在澳大利亚全国各地举行的群众大会上，工人们一致通过决议，要求取消冻结职工会基金的反劳工法，并号召继续罢工，直至当局释放被监禁的职工会领袖并满足罢工工人的经济要求时为止。
    新时代杂志社论在分析伦敦码头工人和澳大利亚矿工的罢工时强调称：这工人阶级坚定不移的榜样，引起了英美反动阵营的愤怒。艾德礼正散布谎言，硬说英国码头工人是“共产党阴谋”的牺牲品。澳大利亚总理齐佛莱也步着艾德礼的后尘。但是，陈腐而令人厌倦的反共运动，蠢笨地企图以叫嚣什么“共产党阴谋”来掩盖资本主义国家内随经济危机以俱来的日益尖锐化的社会矛盾，并不能说服工人群众。新时代杂志结语称，每天都有新的证据证明：体现着劳工运动最好理想的世界工联的力量正日益增长。世界工联各业职工部的成立，对于保进与扩大工人的互相支援与国际团结，将有实际的帮助。
