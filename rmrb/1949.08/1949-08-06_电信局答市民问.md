The Telecommunications Bureau Answers Citizens' Questions

    I. How does your business policy differ from the public utilities of the Kuomintang reactionaries? Where is it manifested? How do prices compare after liberation with the Kuomintang period?
    Before liberation, during the Kuomintang's rule, the telecommunications business served the reactionary gangs, bureaucratic capitalists, profiteers, and special classes of people. The pseudo-legal system had a "New Telephone Installation Restriction Method," Article 1 of which clearly stipulated that new telephone installations were limited to military and political organs, residences of heads of organs, diplomatic groups, news agencies, and newspapers. In other words, ordinary shops, stores, and general residents were refused telephone installations regardless of whether the bureau had available numbers or not. This created a black market for private sale and resale of telephones. Generally, war criminals with power and profiteers with money could install them at will. War criminal Xiong Shihui's four "mansions" had eight telephones; Xu Huidong's family also had five or six telephones. However, productive enterprises, small factories, private primary and secondary schools, and stores, without special influence or money to bribe, were all refused by the old telecommunications bureau on the grounds of "no available numbers."

    Moreover, in the past, telegraph and telephone communications were almost entirely controlled by corrupt officials and profiteers, used as tools to exploit the people. Special express telegrams and telephones, in fact, in the current living conditions of ordinary people, and at a time when business is not very busy, do not seem very necessary. However, pseudo-officials and profiteers colluded, competing to use these "special express" communications as tools to "save time" in hoarding and speculation. Therefore, during the Kuomintang's rule, the more prices fluctuated, the busier the telecommunications business became, and the more painful the lives of the general public became.

    After liberation, the telecommunications business is gradually improving by addressing the mistakes and shortcomings of the past. There will be no more control or manipulation by gangs and profiteers. It has become a tool to serve society and facilitate the people. Compared with the reactionary rule of the past, although it is the same telecommunications business, it has an essential difference.

    Now, telephone access has been opened. Everyone can apply for installation. The set of "Transfer and Relocation Restriction Methods" in the pseudo-regulations has been abolished, giving users legitimate freedom and convenience, and reasonably refunding the deposit fees to customers who had their phones removed. Thus, all the black market dealings of private sale and resale of telephones in the old era are gradually disappearing.

    Currently, the Telecommunications General Bureau is holding a North China Telecommunications Conference, which has made a comprehensive review of the old regulations, and is conducting public opinion surveys to determine improved new regulations through mass opinions, which will be announced and implemented soon.

    Regarding the issue of prices, there were no standards in the Kuomintang era. Sometimes they were too high, so high that ordinary users could not afford them; sometimes they were too low, so low that they resulted in monthly losses, and the pseudo-government had to rely on the indiscriminate issuance of banknotes to subsidize them. The final result was: soaring prices and a precarious livelihood for the people.

    After liberation, the telecommunications business is a public enterprise. Under the principle of "self-sufficiency," the telephone and telegraph prices are determined based on precise calculations, setting a standard for fees based on physical goods (such as 50 jin of millet per month for the rental of a wall-mounted telephone in a manual exchange). This standard is the minimum necessary to maintain rapid communication and the survival of the business. We use this standard to convert to currency, and reasonably charge users for rental fees and quotations, balancing the need to avoid government subsidies and consideration of users' affordability. If compared with the lowest prices in the Kuomintang era, it is indeed higher.

    Generally speaking, the current prices are lower than the high prices during the Kuomintang's rule. We can understand this clearly by comparing them using physical goods as a standard. Now, let's give some practical examples of telephone prices. In June of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the monthly rental fee for a manual residential telephone was seven silver dollars, equivalent to 233.5 jin of millet at that time. In November of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), the monthly rental fee was 15,800 legal tender, equivalent to 79 jin of millet at that time. But the current price for a worker's wall-mounted telephone is 50 jin of millet per month. We calculated it at 60 yuan per jin in June and July, which is almost half the current (end of July) market price. Comparing by the number of jin of millet, it is four times lower than the price in June of the 26th year of the Republic of China, and half the price in November of the 35th year of the Republic of China. However, in the 36th year and the first half of the 37th year of the Republic of China (1947-1948), the Kuomintang deliberately lowered prices, maliciously taking care of the interests of a small number of users, because the users in the past were mostly gang leaders, bureaucratic capitalists, profiteer nouveaux riches, pseudo-senators, secret agents, and special figures with wealth and power. These people had influence in the reactionary society and opposed price increases (and some people did not pay rent at all, using the telephone for free), in order to shift the losses to the majority of ordinary people who did not use telephones and telegraphs, which was clearly an act of being enemies with the people. This behavior is of course not adopted by our People's Government.

### 电信局答市民问

    电信局答市民问
    一、你们的业务方针与国民党反动派的公用事业有何不同？表现在那里？解放后与国民党时期价目比较如何？
    解放前国民党统治时期，电信事业是为反动匪帮、官僚资本家、奸商和特殊阶级的人们服务的。伪法统中有“新装电话限制办法”第一条中有明确的规定，新装电话只限军政机关及机关首长住宅、外交团体、通讯社、报馆等。也就是说，普通商店、铺户和一般老百姓住宅不论局方有无空号，根本拒绝装按电话。于是造成电话私倒、私售的黑幕。一般有势的战犯和有钱的奸商，可以任情的随意装按。战犯熊式辉四个“公馆”有八部电话；许惠东家也有五、六部电话。但生产企业、小型工厂、市私立中小学校、商店，没有特殊势力，没有金钱来私买运动，旧电信局都用“无空号”来拒按。
    又如过去的电报、电话通讯，几完全为贪官和奸商所把持，做为剥削人民的工具。特快电报和电话，事实上，在现代一般老百姓的生活情况里，在目前业务尚不甚忙的时候，似还不太需要。但伪官和奸商们勾结，他们争先的利用这些“特快”通讯，做囤积倒把交易上“争取时间”的工具。所以国民党统治时期，物价越波动，电信业务越繁忙，电信业务越繁忙，一般老百姓的生活就越痛苦了。
    解放后，电信业务是针对着过去的错误和缺点逐步的加以改善。今后再没有匪帮和奸商们的左右与把持，它已经变成服务社会，和便利人民的工具了，和过去反动派统治时期来比较、虽是同一电信事业，却有着其本质上的不同的。
    现在，电话开放了。人人都可以申请按装，伪规章中的一套“过户移机限制办法”取消了，给予用户们合法的自由和便利，并合理的退还拆机户押机费。这样旧时代中一切私售出倒电话的黑幕，就逐渐的消声敛迹了。
    目前，电信总局正在召开华北电信会议，已经把旧规章做一个通盘的检讨；并举办民意测验，通过群众意见，把完善的新规章议定出来，并将随即公布施行。
    又关于价目问题，国民党时代毫无标准，有时过高，高得非普通用户所能负担；有时又过低，低得月月亏累，只好依靠伪府滥发钞票来贴补，最后的结果是：物价暴涨，民不聊生。
    解放后，电信事业是公营企业，在“自给自足”的原则下报话价目，经过精确的核算，订出收费的实物标准（如电话人工局墙机每月租费为小米五十斤），这标准是维持通讯迅速和事业生存上最低的需要，我们用这标准来折合币额，在不靠政府贴补和照顾用户负担的兼备条件下，向用户们合理的收取租费和报价，如果和国民党时最低价目来比较确是提高了。
    一般的说，现价较国民党统治时期之高价为低，我们用实物为标准来相互对照，就可以明了了。现在我们用电话价目来举几个实在的例子二二十六年六月人工住宅电话每月租费为银圆七元，合当时小米二百卅三斤五两，三十五年十一月月租费为法币一万五千八百元，合当时小米七十九斤，但现价工人墙机每月为五十斤小米。我们六、七两月按六十元一斤核的，较现在（七月底）市场售价几乎便宜一倍，用小米斤数来比较，比二十六年六月价低四倍，比三十五年十一月价低半倍。但三十六年和三十七年上半年国民党故意把价目压低，恶意的照顾到少数用户的利益，因为过去的用户多为匪帮头子、官僚资本家、奸商暴发户、伪参议员、特务和有财有势的特殊人物，这些人在反动社会里有势力，反对加价（还有一部分人，根本不交租费，白使电话），好把亏累转嫁给大多数不利用报话的老百姓身上来负担，又是显然和人民为敌的行为，这行为当然为我们人民政府所不取。
