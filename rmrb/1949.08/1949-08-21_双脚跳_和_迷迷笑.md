"Double Jump" and "Smiling Face"
　　Kong Yuan

　　I.
　　When we were in Yan'an, we went to the Fifth District to help with the election. At the district level, we heard someone say, "The Fifth District has a good district chief named Lei Baosheng who is very active in his work. No matter what task the higher authorities give him, he can complete it; and he completes it exceptionally early. For example, if you give him ten days, he will complete it in five days." He also told us, "This Lei Baosheng is truly dedicated to the revolution! During the Land Reform era, he wore the 'flower' three times; later, he was captured by the White Army, who put a 'fire hat' on him—that is, a red-hot iron cover placed on his head, burning all his hair and scorching his skin... But he clenched his teeth and didn't confess a single word." However, the district chief said, "This District Chief Lei also has a serious flaw; the people call him 'Double Jump'!"

　　When we arrived in the Fifth District, we met Lei Baosheng. He looked to be about thirty years old, thin and tall, wearing a tattered military cap and a faded black uniform. He spoke with a hoarse voice, very straightforward. His face was dark, with a gun wound on his right temple: a bright scar that made his right eye droop and his right eyeball protrude. He looked at the letter of introduction with difficulty. As soon as he finished reading it, he was overjoyed and said, "You've come at just the right time! Just the right time! There's a general meeting tomorrow to review the government's work, and you can participate." We were very surprised: other districts are just beginning, how is this district proceeding so quickly? He said confidently, "No problem! Everything is done according to the 'Township Election Instructions'. Propaganda, mobilization, interviews, registration, everything has been done." We asked, "What problems have you found when interviewing the people?" He said, "Our township has no problems! The people haven't raised any objections to me personally either." He said it frankly and cheerfully.

　　II.
　　The next day, there was a mass meeting. In the schoolyard, men and women villagers sat on mats on the ground. After District Chief Lei gave a work report behind a long table, it was time for the people to review and criticize. Lei Baosheng said, "If I have any shortcomings, just say it! It's for my own good, and I won't be embarrassed." However, everyone laughed, some lowered their heads, and no one stood up to speak. Lei Baosheng became anxious, bent down and looked at everyone, asking, "What's wrong? You can't let grass grow in your mouths!"

　　Before he finished speaking, a broad-shouldered farmer, slightly hunchbacked, stood up with a smile. His brown face had cheekbones as red as maple leaves; his head was bald, with only a half-circle of hair left behind his head. He stroked his dark beard while smiling and glancing at us, then began to criticize. His attitude was very gentle and his tone very tactful; but everyone could understand his meaning: he was saying that District Chief Lei was very hardworking and diligent, serving the people wholeheartedly; but he had a bad temper, was impatient, spoke rashly, acted impulsively, used coercion and commandism towards the masses, and lacked methods in his work. He gave some vivid examples that made everyone laugh. Finally, he said, "I know, everyone has opinions, like dumplings cooking in a teapot: they're in your stomach, but you can't pour them out of your mouth." This caused another burst of laughter. Then, several people said, "I'll pour out my dumplings too!" and rushed to express their opinions.

　　A small farmer named Wang San mentioned the "large labor exchange team" organized by Lei Baosheng, saying that he felt it was inconvenient and didn't participate at the time; he drove his ox up the mountain by himself, but from afar, Lei Baosheng chased after him furiously, scaring him so much that he abandoned the ox and ran away. Lei Baosheng chased him over several mountains before grabbing him and dragging him to the labor exchange team; but on the hillside, the members of the labor exchange team had already run away. Wang San said, "How can there be such a large labor exchange team that you're forced to join! It's simply... alas..." As he said this with a mournful face, everyone burst out laughing. We noticed that Lei Baosheng's black face had already turned crimson; he sat there, glaring at Wang San menacingly. We whispered to advise him. However, he suddenly jumped three feet high, pointing directly at Wang San and scolding, "You selfish and self-serving fellow! You don't want to participate in labor exchange, and you're sabotaging it?"

　　Fortunately, the red-cheeked, black-bearded farmer mediated with a smile, saying, "District Chief Lei's intention is also correct. He wants us to exchange labor to produce more grain, so that everyone can eat well and get fat! In the future, as long as the labor exchange team isn't too large, and participation is voluntary and freely combined, that will be good. I think the dumplings have been poured out, and everyone must be hungry, right? I propose that we go home and eat before coming back for the meeting!" Everyone saw that the sun was overhead, and with a laugh, shouted, "Agreed!" and the meeting was adjourned.

　　III.
　　It turned out that the red-cheeked, black-bearded farmer was called Liu Mingde, and he was a village chief. This person was responsible and meticulous in his work, very patient, treated people very kindly, and had very good relations with the masses; everyone called him "Smiling Face." When nominating candidates in the afternoon, he was the first to be nominated. However, some young farmers expressed their opposition; they disliked his slow work, his limited literacy, his being a new cadre, never having been a district chief, and lacking experience; they said that he could handle the affairs of one village well, but they were afraid he couldn't handle the affairs of a whole district.

　　They enumerated Lei Baosheng's many good points. They said that Lei Baosheng was a Bao Gong, an incorruptible official, fair and impartial. One was one, two was two; he said what he needed to say, scolded when he needed to scold; if he should go west, he would never run east. Whether it was collecting grain, collecting grass, assigning labor, or assigning livestock, wasn't everything done fairly? He was also an old revolutionary with a lot of experience. Recently, the township clerk was transferred, and he did the work of two people alone. He really worked himself to death. He always ate late, early, sometimes had a meal, sometimes didn't; and he also suffered three hunger pangs. Just take last year's flood as an example, the crops were wiped out, thanks to District Chief Lei braving the rain to go to the district to get buckwheat seeds, not afraid of the high mountains and long roads, and even wading across the river, almost drowning. When he came back, he lost his shoes. He fell several times on the road, covered in mud. He carried back four dou of buckwheat seeds in one go; as soon as the weather cleared, he immediately forced everyone to rush to plant them. They said that thanks to this one order, everyone later ate buckwheat noodles. If it weren't for District Chief Lei, wouldn't they have been delayed?

　　However, the older farmers advocated: one must be patient in handling affairs! Say what needs to be said, but never scold. Isn't scolding people becoming a warlord? Complete the work in the same way, why offend people? If you offend people, the work may not be completed, or it won't be completed well. The higher authorities called for persuasion and education, not coercion and commandism. If cadres are only allowed to roar and scold, and the people aren't allowed to speak, it would be better to seal the mouths of the people one by one with strips of paper. In fact, three people are worth one official, and a hundred people can accomplish great things. Why not listen to everyone? Everyone is a sage. Take Liu Mingde as an example, he's a "Liu Bei," most able to win people's hearts. He often shares a pipe with the people, chats for a while, talks and laughs, and gets the public affairs done. He speaks in a way that people like to hear. After hearing his words, people are willing to take out their gold ingots at home. Thanks to his good leadership, the men in the village plow and the women weave, and two and a half of the three good-for-nothings have been transformed. Erdan and his wife were at odds and wanted a divorce, but after Old Liu's repeated persuasion, the two are now stuck together like a lump, and even the "Four Heavenly Kings" couldn't pull them apart. Whoever quarrels or fights will be convinced as long as Old Liu says a word. Old Liu is a balance, most fair and reasonable. If you're talking about cadres, isn't this a cadre? Cadre, cadre, as long as you do a good job, it doesn't matter if you're new or old; who was born to be a district chief? If you're not literate, there's a clerk; if there's a shortage of clerks right now, you can immediately hire one. Besides, Liu Mingde's beard isn't white yet, he can still learn!

　　Wang San's mother said, "You talk about buckwheat, I'll talk about cotton. None of us know how to grow cotton; Old Liu went to find a cotton-planting hero to learn the skills, and came back to teach us household by household, and even went to each family's field to help with the tending. You tell me! You tell me! How much cotton was harvested this year? It can be used to make clothes, and it can be spun into thread to weave cloth, isn't Old Liu's contribution the greatest?" The women shouted, "That's right! That's right! Stop talking, we support Uncle Liu!" They stirred up a hornet's nest, chirping and chattering, "We want 'Smiling Face'! We don't want 'Double Jump'!" But the young men shouted, "No! We want 'Double Jump'! We don't want 'Smiling Face'!" One side shouted, "Don't want 'Double Jump'! We must have 'Smiling Face'!" while the other side shouted, "Don't want 'Smiling Face'! We must have 'Double Jump'!" All that could be heard was "'Double Jump'!" "'Smiling Face'!" "'Smiling Face'!" "'Double Jump'!"... The two factions argued endlessly!

　　IV.
　　On the day of the election of representatives, the candidates sat in a semicircle in the cave; everyone faced the wall, with a bowl placed behind them, the mouth of the bowl covered with paper, with only a small hole opened in the paper, ready to receive the bean votes. Lei Baosheng and Liu Mingde were also sitting inside; they were both approved candidates. Originally, according to the regulations, the representatives were to be elected first, and then the representatives would elect the district chief. At this time, Lei Baosheng was very uneasy, often turning his thin face, the protruding eyes under his drooping eyelids seemed to be looking at something; he seemed very worried that the people would "not want him anymore." Liu Mingde sat steadily, his broad shoulders, slightly hunched back, not moving at all. In fact, everyone was very nervous, some supporting Lei Baosheng, some supporting Liu Mingde, all wanting to know who would get more votes. Outside the door, here a group, there a group, men and women, were all discussing.

　　After a while, the beans were distributed; each voter had the same number of beans. The person calling the names shouted in the cave, and the crowd outside stirred, all crowding towards the entrance of the cave. The person whose name was called responded with a laugh and hurried in to cast their bean votes. It was truly: "Beans are cast into the bowls of good people!" Even a blind man surnamed Yang carefully asked who each bowl belonged to before preparing to cast his vote. He knew what he was doing, groping as he said, "Ha! Buying glasses needs to match the eyes!" The farmers monitoring the votes laughed, "Oh, according to your eyes, what kind of glasses are you preparing to buy?" Yang the blind man said, "Hey! My eyes are blind, but my heart isn't, just watch!" He carefully groped for Liu Mingde's bowl and dropped his first bean into it...

　　The most tense moment was when the votes were counted. In the courtyard, everyone surrounded the table, anxiously watching. Without the township clerk, Teacher Zhou from the school wore a pair of reading glasses, helping several farmers count the votes. Ah, unexpectedly, Lei Baosheng's votes (beans) were particularly numerous, with as many as one hundred and ninety-five votes. Many people applauded and cheered. We quickly pulled Lei Baosheng, saying, "Look! Look! The people still support you!" Lei Baosheng was too moved, he saw that the people still wanted him, and he was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth, his mouth twitching, unable to speak for a moment. At this moment, people became quiet again, waiting for Liu Mingde's vote count. Teacher Zhou felt very strange, saying, "Huh! It's also exactly one hundred and ninety-five votes!" Many people applauded and cheered again. Everyone said, "Ah! What's going on? The same number of votes!" Teacher Zhou said, "Old Lei and Old Liu are tied! We'll see who's better at the representatives' meeting the day after tomorrow when we elect the district chief."

　　V.
　　In the blink of an eye, the representatives' meeting was held. It was in the school's classroom. Many red and green slogans were posted on the four walls. The representatives sat neatly in the front rows of seats. District Chief Lei stepped onto the teaching platform, summarized the past work experience, everyone discussed the proposals, and passed new production plans, and then elected the new district chief. This was called: "To have a good life, elect a good leader!" There were twenty-five representatives from the whole township, including men and women. Many people wore new clothes and new hats. Each person wore a big red flower on their chest. Most of them were literate. After receiving the ballots, a group of people dispersed, quietly writing. Some who couldn't write whispered for us to write for them. In less than a few minutes, the ballots were collected and about to be counted. Ah, how many people! All crowded to the door and windows, craning their necks to look. A band of musicians waited at the door to play. Also, people setting off firecrackers waited to set them off, people writing happy reports waited to write... Everyone waited nervously.

　　The votes were being counted. On the teaching platform, the ballot reader, Teacher Zhou, called out whose name was on the ballot, and a young farmer recording the votes drew lines under whose name on the blackboard. All that could be heard was Teacher Zhou calling out: "Liu Mingde!" "Another Liu Mingde!" "Another Liu Mingde!"... It was so quiet inside and outside the cave that the sound of chalk drawing lines on the blackboard could be heard. We stole a glance at Lei Baosheng, only to see him sitting in the corner, his face pale, large beads of sweat flowing from his forehead; he must be worried that the people would "not want him anymore," but he still unconsciously wore a smile. We looked at Liu Mingde again, his complexion was so good: both cheekbones were even redder, and his beard shone brightly; he seemed unconcerned, bent over, and lightly tapped the ashes out of his pipe on the sole of his shoe.

　　At this moment, Liu Mingde already had seven votes. Only then did we hear the call: "Lei Baosheng!" But strangely enough, the calls that followed were all "Lei Baosheng." In a short while, Lei Baosheng's lines increased, and he actually had eight votes. Only then did we hear: "Liu Mingde!" But then we heard: "Lei Baosheng!" In this way, for a while, the two were tied, and then one had one more vote than the other. (In addition, there were two votes for others) Later, Lei Baosheng had eleven votes. But immediately after, Liu Mingde also had eleven votes. At this time, Teacher Zhou had only one ballot left in his hand. Everyone knew that this ballot would make the final decision. Everyone was so nervous that they couldn't breathe! Teacher Zhou was probably too nervous, his hand trembled as he opened the ballot. He looked at the ballot, as if he hadn't seen it clearly, and then raised his reading glasses, which had slid down to the tip of his nose, and looked at it carefully. Then, he raised his head and shouted out three words loudly: "Liu—Ming—De—!" Immediately, there was an explosion of earth-shattering applause, cheers, music, and firecrackers... At the same time, gongs sounded, sending happy reports to the villages.

　　VI.
　　In that chaos, Lei Baosheng quietly slipped out. The representatives calmed down, discussed for a while, and made several new resolutions. After the meeting, everyone had a potluck meal, happily eating *heleme* noodles. We still didn't see Lei Baosheng, where did he go? We couldn't eat, and hurried to look for him. In a mountain gully, we saw Lei Baosheng squatting under a large tree, his head lowered. Another person was squatting next to him, one hand on his back, one hand on his knee, talking to him. This person had a bald spot, with a half-circle of hair left behind his head, it was none other than Liu Mingde.

　　We ran over. Lei Baosheng looked up. We saw his eyes were red, as if he had been crying. We quickly bent down and comforted him: "Comrade Lei, there's new news, did you know? Just now the representatives resolved to ask you to be the township clerk. The township clerk is the same as the deputy district chief, in reality you're still the district chief!" But we didn't expect this to offend him. He trembled with anger, jumped up and glared at us, saying, "Are you blind! Am I after personal status?" Saying this, he walked away angrily. Liu Mingde looked at us as if looking at children who had done something wrong, smiling and saying, "You don't understand him. He joined the revolution not to become a dragon, or a tiger... You haven't entered his state of mind; he's not that kind of person. As long as the people want him, not to mention being a clerk, he's willing to do anything the revolution asks him to do. Just now, he was feeling bad about his shortcomings!" After saying this, he strode off to chase Lei Baosheng.

　　That night, the old district chief handed over the work to the new district chief, and the two didn't sleep until the rooster crowed. The next morning, we saw the thin Lei Baosheng, still wearing his tattered military cap and faded black uniform, not washing his face or eating anything, his dark face very serious, slung his bag, and looked like he was about to leave. We asked him, "Where are you going?" He shook the roll of production plans in his hand, smiled at us shyly, and said, "Going to the mass line!" We understood his determination, immediately shook his hand warmly, and he left.

　　“双脚跳”和“迷迷笑”
    孔袁
　　一
    在延安的时候，我们曾经到五乡去，帮助选举。在区上，就听得有人说：“五乡有个好乡长，叫雷保生，工作很积极。不论上级给他什么任务，他都能完成；还完成得特别早。比如：你限他十天，他五天就完成了。”他还告诉我们：“这雷保生，真是实心革命的人！土地革命时代，他带了三次花；后来又被白军捉住，给他‘戴火帽’，就是用铁的火盖，烧得通红，在他脑上一扣，头发全烧光，皮肉稀破烂……他可死咬住门牙，没有招认一句话。”可是区长说：“这雷乡长，也有严重的缺点，老百姓叫他‘双脚跳’！”
    到了五乡，我们见到雷保生了。他不过三十岁模样，又瘦又长，戴着破军帽，穿着发了黄的黑制服。说话沙嗓子，很直爽。黑苍苍脸儿，右太阳穴有个枪伤：明光光的疤痕，使右眼角吊起，右眼珠突了出来。他吃力地看着介绍信。一看完，可就高兴极了，说：“来得正好！来得正好！明天开大会，检查政府工作，你们就参加。”我们很奇怪：别乡刚开始，这乡怎么进行得这样快？他很有自信地说：“没问题！一切都照‘乡选指示’办的。宣传动员，访问登记，什么都作过了。”我们问：“访问老百姓中间，发现了什么问题？”他说：“咱乡没问题！老百姓对我个人呢，也一满没提什么意见。”他坦然地说着，很愉快。
　　二
    第二天，群众大会。在学校的院子里，男女老乡们铺着席子坐在地上，雷乡长站在长桌后面报告过工作，就该老百姓检查、批评了。雷保生说：“我有什么缺点，你们只管说！这是为我好，我决不脸红。”可是，大家笑着，有的低着头，没有人起来说话。雷保生急了，弯下腰瞅着大家问：“怎么啦？嘴里可不能长青草啊！”
    一句话没落音，就有一个宽肩膀、略有些驼背的农民，笑嘻嘻地站起来。他的棕色脸上，颧骨象枫叶一样红；头顶可秃了，脑后留着半圈头发。他一面摸着黑黑的胡须，一面含笑地对我们看了一眼，就批评起来。他的态度很温和，语气很婉转；可是大家听得出他的意思，是说雷乡长很吃苦，很努力，一满为咱老百姓服务；就不过脾气大，性子急，说话冒，办事冲，对群众强迫命令，工作上缺乏方式。他举了一些生动的例子，说得大家都笑了。末了他说：“我知道，大家意见是有哩，好比茶壶里煮扁食：肚肚里有，就是口口里倒不出来。”又引起一阵笑声。接着，就有好几个人说：“我也来倒扁食！”都抢着发表意见。
    有一个叫做王三的小个儿农民，提起了雷保生组织的“大变工队”，说他感到不便，当时没参加；自个儿赶牛上山，可是远远地，雷保生气汹汹地追来了，吓得他撇下牛，赶忙跑。雷保生直追了几架山，才把他一把抓住，拉到变工队去；可是山坡上，变工队的人早都跑光了。王三说：“天下哪有这样大的变工队，还死逼着要参加的！简直是………唉唉……”他哭丧着脸儿这么一说，可把众人笑坏了。我们注意到，雷保生的黑脸儿，早已涨得酱红；他坐在那里，眼睛对王三可怕地瞪着。我们就低声地劝他。可是，他忽地一跳三尺高，直指着王三骂：“你这自私自利的家伙！你不想参加变工，你还破坏？”。
    幸喜那个红颧骨、黑胡须的农民，笑嘻嘻地调解说：“雷乡长的意思可也对着哩。他叫我们变工多打粮，要大家吃得胖胖儿嘛！往后变工队只要不搞得太大，自愿参加，自由结合，那就好啦。我看现在扁食已经倒空，肚子该饿了吧？我提议，咱们回家吃罢饭再来开会！”大家一看日头当了顶，笑着一声吼：“同意！”就休会了。
　　三
    原来那个红颧骨、黑胡须的农民，叫刘明德，是个村长。这人工作负责、细法，很有耐性，待人最和气，群众关系挺好；大家叫他“迷迷笑”。下午提候选选人的时候，他首先就被提了出来。可是，有些年轻的农民表示反对；嫌他作事慢，嫌他认字少，嫌他是个新干部，没当过乡长，缺乏经验；说他一村的事儿能办好，一乡的事儿怕担当不起。
    他们数了雷保生的许多好处。说雷保生是个包公，铁面无私。一是一，二是二；该说就说，该骂就骂；应当往西走，决不朝东跑。征粮征草，派夫派牲口，哪一桩不办得公公道道？又是个老革命，经验大多了。最近调走了乡文书，他一个人就作两个人的事。工作可真是拼死干啦。吃饭总是迟一顿，早一顿，有一顿，没一顿；另外还有三顿饿气受呢。就说去年那一次发大水吧，庄稼光溜光了，亏得雷乡长冒着雷雨，跑到区上去领荞麦籽，不怕山高路远，还趟水过河，差点儿淹死。回来的时候，鞋子都跑丢了。路上跌了几交，滚了一身泥。一下子可背回来四斗荞麦籽；天一晴，立逼大家赶种上。说凭这一道命令，后来家家吃上了荞麦面。要不是雷乡长，不就误啦？
    可是，年老的农民们主张：办事可得有耐性哩！该说就说，说什么也不该骂。骂人不是要军阀了吗？一样把工作完成，何必得罪人？得罪了人，工作未见就完成，完成也完成不好。上级叫说服教育，可没叫强迫命令。要只许干部嘶骂，不许百姓说话，倒不如把老百姓的嘴巴，一个个用纸条儿封起来。其实三个人顶一个官，一百个人就能作大事。为什么不服众人？众人可是圣人呢。就说刘明德吧，他是个“刘备”，最能得人心。常常跟老百姓抽一袋烟，拉一阵话，说说笑笑，就把公事办了。他说话叫人爱听。听了他的话，家里有元宝也乐意拿出来。凭他好领导，村里男耕女织，三个二流子倒有两个半转变了。二旦他夫妇不和，闹离婚，经老刘三番五次劝，现在两口子团成一疙瘩，叫“四大金刚”去拉也拉不开。谁要吵架闹武，只要老刘说一句话就服气。老刘是一杆秤，最公平合理。要说干部，这不是个干部？干部干部，只要干得好，不在新和老；谁生下来就当乡长的？识字少，有文书；眼下缺文书，可以马上请一个。再说，刘明德的胡须还不白，他还可以学嘛！
    王三他娘说：“你们说荞麦，我就说棉花。咱们谁都不会种棉花；老刘他去找植棉英雄学了本事，回来挨家挨户地教，还到一家家的地里去，帮着务育。你们说！你们说！今年棉花收了多少？又能装衣服，又能纺线线织布，还不是老刘的头一功？”妇女们都喊：“对着哩！对着哩！别说了，咱就拥护刘大叔！”她们象喜鹊窝里捣了一扁担，吱吱哇哇，吵嚷起来：“咱就要迷迷笑！不要双脚跳！”可是小伙子们喊着：“不！咱就要双脚跳！不要迷迷笑！”一边喊：“不要双脚跳！一定要迷迷笑！”一边叫：“不要迷迷笑！一定要双脚跳！”只听见“双脚跳！”“迷迷笑！”“迷迷笑！”“双脚跳！”……两派人争了个不可开交！
　　四
    选代表那天，候选人在窑里坐了一个半圆形；人人脸朝墙，背后放一个碗，碗口用纸糊住，纸上只开一个小洞洞，预备投豆豆的。雷保生和刘明德也坐在里面；他们都是被通过的候选人。原来照规定，是要选了代表，再由代表选乡长的。这时候，雷保生很不安，时常侧转他那瘦脸儿来，吊起的眼皮下面，突出的眼睛好象望着什么；看来他是很担心老百姓“不要他了”。刘明德可稳稳地坐着，宽宽儿的肩膀，略有些驼的背，一动也不动。实在呢，人们都很紧张，有的赞成雷保生，有的拥护刘明德，都想知道他俩究竟谁的票多。门外，这儿一群，那儿一伙，男男女女，都在谈论。
    一会儿，豆子发给了；每个选民都是一样的几颗。点名的人在窑里一声喊　，外面人群就骚动起来，一齐往窑门口拥。被点到名字的人就笑着应了一声，匆匆进去，投豆豆。正是：“豆豆往好人碗里投！”连一个姓杨的瞎子，都一一问清楚了哪个碗是谁，才准备投。他可是心里有底儿，一面摸索着，一面说：“哈！买眼镜要对眼哩嘛！”监票的农民们笑着：“哦，按你的眼睛，你准备买什么眼镜？”杨瞎子说：“嗨！我眼瞎心不瞎，你看吧！”他很小心地摸到刘明德的碗，投进了他的第一颗……
    最紧张是开票的时候。在院子里，大家围住桌子，急着瞧。没有乡文书，学校的周老师戴着一付老花眼镜，帮几个农民开票。啊，意外地，雷保生的票（豆豆）特别多，竟有一百九十五票。好多人鼓掌欢呼了。我们忙拉着雷保生，说：“看！看！老百姓还是拥护你哩！”雷保生太感动了，他看见老百姓还要他，喜得嘴巴都合不拢，嘴角抽动着，一时说不出话。这当儿，人们可又肃静了，正在等刘明德的票数。周老师觉得很奇怪，说：“咦！刚好也是一百九十五票！”又有好多人鼓掌欢呼了。大家说：“哈呀！这是怎么回事？一样的票数！”周老师说：“老雷老刘平了！到后天代表会，选举乡长再见高低吧。”
　　五
    转眼就开代表会了。是在学校的教室里。四面墙上贴了许多红红绿绿的标语。代表们整整齐齐地坐在前几排座位上。雷乡长走上教台，总结了过去的工作经验，大家讨论了提案，通过了新的生产计划，就选举新乡长。这叫做：“要得生活好，选个好头脑！”全乡二十五个代表，里面有男的，也有女的。许多人穿着新衣新帽。每人胸前别一朵大红花。他们大多识些字。领了选票，一伙人就散开，悄悄地写起来了。有些不会写的，低声说给我们代写。不到几分钟，票一集中，就要开票了。啊，多少老百姓！全拥到门口窗口，伸长脖子探望。一班吹鼓手，在门口等着吹打。还有，放鞭炮的等着放，写喜报的等着写……大家都紧张地等着。
    开票了。在教台上，唱票的周老师唱谁一票，记票的一个年轻农民就在黑板上谁的名下画一道道。只听得周老师唱：“刘明德！”“又来一个刘明德！”“再来一个刘明德！”……窑里窑外都那么静，听得出粉笔在黑板上画道道的声音。我们偷眼瞧雷保生，只见他坐在角落里，面色灰白，大颗的汗珠从额上流下来；他一定是又在担心老百姓“不要他了”，可还无意识地带着笑容。我们又瞧刘明德，他的气色多么好：两边颧骨更红了，胡须黑得发亮；他可不在意似地，弯了腰，在鞋底上轻轻儿＠掉烟锅里的烟灰。
    这工夫，刘明德已经七票了。这才听得唱：“雷保生！”可也真怪，唱下去又都是“雷保生”。只一会儿，雷保生的道道就多起来，反而有八票了。这才又听见：“刘明德！”可是又听见：“雷保生！”这样，一会儿两个人平，一会见又有一个人多一票。（另外有别人的两票）到后来，雷保生就有十一票了。可是紧接着，刘明德也有十一票了。这时候，周老师手里只剩下一张票了。大家知道，这张票就要作最后的决定。谁都紧张得透不过气来！周老师大约是太紧张了，拆开票，手有些抖。他凑在票上看了一下，好象没看清，又把那滑到了鼻尖上的老花眼镜抬起，仔细地看了一下，然后，抬起头来，大声地喊出了三个字：“刘—明—德—！”立刻，爆发了震天动地的掌声，欢呼声，鼓乐声，鞭炮声……同时，锣声铛铛地，送喜报到各村去了。

    在那一阵混乱中间，雷保生悄悄地溜出去了。代表们静下来，讨论了一阵，作了几个新的决议。散会后，大家会餐，欢欢喜喜地吃合乐（＠＠）面。我们依旧不见雷保生，他到哪里去了呢？我们吃不下面了，赶忙去找。在山沟里，我们远远地发现雷保生蹲在一棵大树下，低着头。另一个人蹲在他的旁边，一只手搭在他的背上，一只手搭在他的膝头上，正在和他说话。这人光光的脑门心，后面留着半圈头发，原来正是刘明德。
    我们跑了过去。雷保生抬起头来看。我们见他眼睛发红，好象哭过似的。我们急忙弯下腰去，安慰他：“雷同志，有一个新消息，你知道了没有？刚才代表们决议，请你作乡文书。乡文书就和副乡长一样，实际上你还是个乡长哪！”可想不到这就触犯他了。他气得嘴唇发抖，跳起来瞪着我们说：“瞎你们的眼睛了！我是闹个人地位吗？”说着，很生气地走了。刘明德看着我们，仿佛看着作错了事的孩子，笑迷迷地说：“你们不知道他。他闹革命，倒不是想成龙，想变虎……你们没走他的心境；他不是那好号人。只要老百姓要他，别说作文书，革命上叫他干什么，他都情愿呢。刚才他是为了自己的缺点，正难受哩！”说完，他跨着大步子，追雷保生去了。
    这一夜，旧乡长给新乡长交代工作，两个人直到鸡叫才睡。第二天清早，我们看见瘦长条儿的雷保生，依旧戴着破军帽，穿着发了黄的黑制服，脸也不洗，东西也不吃，黑苍苍脸儿很严肃，挎上了挂包，就要走的样子。我们问他：“走哪儿去？”他摇摇手里的一卷生产计划，不好意思地对我们笑了一笑，说：“走群众路线去！”我们明白了他的决心，立刻亲亲热热地和他握了握手，他就出去了。
