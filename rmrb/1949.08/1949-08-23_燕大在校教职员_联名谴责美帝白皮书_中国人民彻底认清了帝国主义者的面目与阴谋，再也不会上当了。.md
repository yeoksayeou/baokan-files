　　Yanjing University Faculty and Staff Jointly Condemn the U.S. Imperialist White Paper: The Chinese People Have Thoroughly Recognized the Ugly Face and Conspiracy of the Imperialists and Will Never Be Fooled Again.
　　[Ping City News] One hundred and twenty-four faculty and staff members of Yanjing University who were on campus during the summer jointly condemned the White Paper issued by the U.S. State Department. The full text is as follows:

　　The White Paper on China issued recently by the U.S. State Department is a confession of the U.S.'s interference in China's internal affairs and infringement upon the interests of the Chinese people over the years. From now on, the Chinese people have thoroughly recognized the ugly face and conspiracy of the imperialists and will never be fooled again.

　　In the White Paper, Acheson put forward so-called "democratic individualists" and attempted to use them to oppose China's people's democratic regime. The people he is referring to are probably intellectuals who were deeply influenced by Anglo-American thought in the past. If so, we believe that Acheson's fantasy will surely fail again.

　　Due to historical reasons, there is indeed so-called "democratic individualism" among Chinese intellectuals, and they once had considerable yearning for the bourgeois civilization represented by Britain and the United States. During Marshall's "mediation" in China, this illusion once developed into the so-called middle route, and even had some connection with the psychology of dependence on Britain and the United States. However, because the U.S. government has continuously instigated the Kuomintang reactionaries to massacre the Chinese people, and because the general individualistic intellectuals have a strong sense of patriotism and are loyal to their motherland and people, therefore, with the progress of the Liberation War, they have risen up one after another and united with the broad masses of the people. Even if some people still hold on to individualism, it is the freedom of thought within the scope of people's democracy, and they will never be used by American conspiracies to disperse the people's strength. Whoever disperses the people's strength will cut themselves off from the Chinese people and will inevitably perish with all the reactionaries.

　　We, the faculty and staff of Yanjing University, have always believed in the friendship between the Chinese and American people, and we also believe that our American friends, as long as they have goodwill towards the Chinese people, will never and should not hope that their friends will act as tools of foreign countries, violate the interests of the Chinese people, and oppose the government supported by their own people. If anyone thinks this way, then he is not a friend of the Chinese people. Now the fact is very clear that the U.S. government is precisely using this so-called "friendship" to fool the Chinese and American people. Therefore, all those who sincerely cherish the friendship between the Chinese and American people should rise up and oppose this policy of aggression against China.

　　From now on, we must strengthen our vigilance, resolutely stand on the side of the Chinese people, that is, on the side of the world's people's democratic camp, oppose all the conspiracies of the U.S. government, consolidate the victory of the Chinese people's liberation cause, and strive for the success of the people's democratic construction.

　　燕大在校教职员
  　联名谴责美帝白皮书
    中国人民彻底认清了帝国主义者的面目与阴谋，再也不会上当了。
    【平市讯】燕京大学暑期在校教职员一百二十四人联名谴责美国务院发表的白皮书，全文如下：
    美国国务院最近所发表的对华问题白皮书是历年来美国干涉中国内政，侵害中国人民利益的供状。从此以后，中国人民彻底认清了帝国主义者的面目与阴谋，再也不会上当了。
    在白皮书里艾奇逊提出所谓“民主个人主义者”，并且还企图利用他们来反对中国的人民民主政权。他所指的当系从前受英美思想影响较深的知识分子，如果是这样，我们相信，艾奇逊的幻想一定又要落空。
    由于历史的关系，目前中国知识分子当中的确有所谓“民主个人主义”，对于以英美为代表的资产阶级文明存过相当憧憬。在马歇尔来华“调停”期间，这种幻想并曾一度发展为所谓中间路线，甚而至于和对英美依存的心理多少有些联系。但是，由于美国政府不断嗾使国民党反动派屠杀中国人民，由于一般带个人主义的知识分子具有强烈的爱国心，忠诚于自己的祖国和人民，因此，随着解放战争的进展，他们已经纷纷起来，和广大人民团结一致。其中即或有人还是抱着个人主义，那也是人民民主范围之内的思想自由，他们也决不至于为美国阴谋所利用来分散人民的力量。凡是分散人民的力量的，就是自绝于中国人民，必然要和一切反动分子同归于尽。
    我们燕京大学教职员素来相信中美两国人民之间的友谊，同时也相信，我们的美国朋友们，只要对中国人民怀着善意，就决不会也不应该希望他们的友人充当外国的工具，违背中国人民的利益，反对本国人民所拥护的政府。如果有人这样想，那么他就不是中国人的朋友了。现在事实很清楚，美国政府就正是用这种所谓“友谊”来愚弄中美两国人民，因此，凡是真诚爱护中美人民的友谊的，都应该起来反对这种对华的侵略政策。
    从今以后，我们必须加强警觉，坚决的站在中国人民方面，也就是站在世界人民民主阵营方面，反对美国政府的一切阴谋，巩固中国人民解放事业的胜利，争取人民民主主义建设的成功。
