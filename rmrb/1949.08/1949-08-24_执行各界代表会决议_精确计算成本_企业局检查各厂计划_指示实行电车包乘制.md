　　Implementing Resolutions of the All-Circles Representatives Conference
  　Accurately Calculating Costs
  　Enterprise Bureau Inspects Factory Plans
    Instructions to Implement Streetcar Contract System
    [This City News] In order to implement the resolutions and spirit of the All-Circles Representatives Conference, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Enterprise Bureau convened a preliminary discussion with the heads of its affiliated factories and mines on the 15th. On the afternoon of the 22nd, the bureau convened a symposium with the heads of its affiliated units, including the Pingxi Coal Mining Company, Streetcar Company, Water Company, Qinghe Woolen Mill, Yanjing Paper Mill, Xin Jian Glass Factory, and Public Bus Company, to discuss each unit's preliminary implementation plans for the resolutions of the All-Circles Representatives Conference.
    Regarding the cost reduction item, the Water Company plans to focus on expanding users in terms of increasing revenue; in terms of reducing expenditure, it will implement daily work reports, budgets, and inspection systems. In the past six months, the company has saved approximately 30,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month, and after inspecting for leaks, it has eliminated more than 30,000 metric tons of water leakage per month; in terms of charges, "bad debts" have been reduced from 30 percent to 4 percent; after personnel adjustments, 31,000 jin of millet are saved each month; a total of more than 110,000 jin of millet can be saved each month. Therefore, the cost per metric ton of water is reduced by approximately 24 or 25 yuan. Under unified leadership, the Qinghe Woolen Mill calculates costs separately for each production unit; electricity consumption has been reduced by dozens of characters per day; the spinning wheels in the combing and spinning department, which originally had five people, are now only equipped with four or three people; administratively, it is also planned to organize the manpower saved from various departments to engage in sideline businesses. The Streetcar Company plans to publish advertisements on the cars, use old waste tickets, and use ticket boxes to collect the waste tickets collected every day and sell them as waste paper. Vice Director of the Enterprise Bureau, Jia Tingsan, pointed out that the central issue for the Streetcar Company is to implement the contract system. If there is a system for driving and the vehicles are driven carefully, on the one hand, repair costs can be reduced, and on the other hand, the number of trips can be increased, increasing income. With the implementation of the contract system and the revenue from electricity sales, it is estimated that more than 40 million yuan can be collected each month, not including the saved expenses. Because the Xin Jian Glass Factory has too many product styles and the work is relatively chaotic, although a work report system has been established, costs cannot be accurately calculated; after discussion at the meeting, everyone believed that the glass factory could also establish cost accounting by establishing standards from the average.
    The Enterprise Bureau will formulate a work plan for September and October based on the resolutions of the All-Circles Representatives Conference and the circumstances of the various factories and mines. Director Mou Zexian and Deputy Director Jia Tingsan also ordered all units that have not formulated plans to implement the resolutions of the Representatives Conference to formulate and submit them to the bureau as soon as possible.

　　执行各界代表会决议
  　精确计算成本
  　企业局检查各厂计划
    指示实行电车包乘制
    【本市讯】北平市人民政府企业局为了贯彻各界代表会议的决议与精神，曾于十五日召集所属各厂矿负责人作初步讨论。二十二日下午，该局又召集所属平西煤矿公司、电车公司、自来水公司、清河制呢厂、燕京造纸厂、新建玻璃厂、公共汽车公司等七单位负责人举行座谈会，讨论各单位对各界代表大会决议所拟的初步执行计划。
    自来水公司对减低成本一项，准备在开源方面，有重点的扩充用户；节流方面，实行工作日报、预算、检查等制度。该公司半年来，由于每月省电三万度左右，检查漏水后每月免除漏水三万余公吨；收费方面“呆帐”（即死帐）从百分之三十减至百分之四；人事调整后，每月节省了三万一千斤小米；共计每月可节省十一万余斤小米。因此每公吨水的成本约减低二十四、五元。清河制呢厂在统一领导下，各生产单位分散计算成本，用电量每天就省了几十个字，梳纺部原来五个人的纺车，现只配备四个人或三个人；行政上并准备把各部门节省出来的人力，组织起来，去搞副业。电车公司计划在车上登刊广告，改用旧存废票，并作票箱，把每天收回的废票集中起来当废纸卖。当经企业局贾庭三副局长指出，电车公司的中心问题在于实行包乘制，如果行车有了制度，车辆仔细行驶，一面可减少修理费用，一面可增多行车次数，增加收入。施用包乘制加上售电的收入，估计每月可多收四千余万元，节省的费用还不在内。新建玻璃厂因产品式样太多，工作较乱，虽然定了工作报告制，仍然不能精确的计算成本；在会上讨论结果，大家认为，玻璃厂也是可以从平均数订标准来确立成本会计的。
    企业局将根据各界代表会的决议和各厂矿的情形，拟定九、十两月的工作计划。牟泽衔局长、贾庭三副局长并令各单位没有拟定执行代表会议决议计划的，赶快制订交局。
