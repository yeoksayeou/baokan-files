Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, August 23rd: Since the beginning of summer, the Zhengzhou and Huangchuan regions of Henan Province have suffered from severe drought with no rain, causing seedlings to wither. At the beginning of this month, the two administrative offices issued "Drought Prevention and Famine Preparedness" instructions, calling on cadres in various counties and districts to go deep among the masses, conduct extensive propaganda, break down the superstitious ideas of "relying on the heavens for food" and praying for rain, and make full use of rivers, canals, and wells to irrigate and save seedlings, and collect late autumn seeds such as buckwheat and radish, preparing to plant them quickly after the rain. At the same time, efforts should be made to conserve production, prepare grain for famine, and mobilize the masses to help each other. In the first ten days of this month, Rongyang, Chenggao, Gongxian, Dengfeng, Yuxian and other places under the Zhengzhou region experienced widespread soaking rain, and autumn seedlings were saved. The Yuxian People's Government has lent out 500 catties of buckwheat seeds and more than 100 catties of rapeseed, respectively, to help farmers rush to plant late autumn crops. Farmers in Rongyang and Gongxian are also stepping up weeding and fertilizing, and rushing to plant late autumn crops.

　　郑州地区久旱逢雨
  　抢种晚秋
    【新华社开封二十三日电】河南省郑州潢川两专区各地入夏以来苦旱无雨，禾苗枯萎。两专署分别于本月初发出“防旱备荒”指示，号召各县区干部深入群众，展开广泛宣传，打破“靠天吃饭”和求神祈雨等迷信思想，尽量利用河渠、水井浇水抢救禾苗，并搜集荞麦、萝卜等晚秋种籽，准备下雨后抢种。同时，应进行生产节约、备粮备荒，发动群众互助互济。本月初旬，郑州专区所属荣阳、成臬、巩县、登封、禹县等地普遍透雨，秋苗得救。禹县人民政府已分别贷出荞麦种籽五百斤和菜籽种一百多斤，帮助农民抢种晚秋。荣阳、巩县各地农民现亦加紧锄草、施肥，抢种晚秋。
