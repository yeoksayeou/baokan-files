Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 8th: The person in charge of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles today issued a statement regarding the Hong Kong British government's expulsion of Mr. Zhou Gangming, the executive director of the Hong Kong Literary Association, stating: On July 21st, the writer Zhou Gangming, residing in Hong Kong, was suddenly ordered by the Hong Kong government to leave the country within a certain period, without stating any reasons. We are extremely indignant upon learning of this matter. Mr. Zhou Gangming is the executive director of the Hong Kong Literary Association. The Hong Kong Literary Association is a literary writers' group officially registered with the Hong Kong government and has existed for three years. Its activities have always been praised by patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. Mr. Zhou Gangming is a patriotic and progressive writer who has made many contributions to the literary cause of overseas Chinese and is well known. Now, the Hong Kong government has suddenly ordered Mr. Zhou Gangming to leave the country within a certain period. This is persecution of progressives and an unreasonable and reactionary anti-Chinese act. Since the spring of this year, the Hong Kong government has promulgated so-called "Security Ordinances," "Education Ordinances," and "Societies Ordinances," etc., the purpose of which is to deprive our compatriots residing in Hong Kong of their due rights. The expulsion of Mr. Zhou Gangming is the first public suppression of progressive cultural figures residing in Hong Kong by the Hong Kong government under the cover of the so-called "Societies Ordinance." Therefore, we must solemnly declare that Chinese literary and art circles believe that the Zhou Gangming incident is not a simple individual event, but the beginning of a planned public suppression of progressive people residing in Hong Kong by the Hong Kong government. This is in stark contrast to the just and wise policy of our People's Government to protect law-abiding British overseas citizens. The Hong Kong government should seriously consider the consequences that its reactionary policy of oppressing overseas Chinese compatriots may cause.

    英帝无理驱逐港文协理事
    全国文联严正声明
    反动政策必将自食其果
    【新华社北平八日电】中华全国文学艺术界联合会负责人本日对香港英政府驱逐香港文艺协会常务理事周钢鸣先生一事发表谈话称：七月二十一日，侨居香港的文学作家周钢鸣先生，突然被香港政府限期驱逐出境，而且并未宣布理由。我们闻悉此事，不胜愤慨。周钢鸣先生是香港文艺协会的常务理事，香港文艺协会是在香港政府正式登记了的文学作家们的团体，已有三年之久，它的活动一向为香港爱国侨胞所赞扬；周钢鸣先生是爱国的进步的文学作家，对于侨胞文学事业，多所贡献，亦为人所共知。现在香港政府突然限期驱逐周钢鸣先生出境，这是对于进步人士的迫害，而且是无理由的反动的排华行为。香港政府自从本年春季以来，颁布了所谓“安全条例”，“教育条例”，“社团条例”等等，其目的都是为了剥夺我留港侨胞应有的权利。此次驱逐周钢鸣先生出境，就是香港政府在所谓“社团条例”掩护下，第一次公开压迫我留港的进步文化人士。为此我们不得不严正声明：中国文艺界同人认为周钢鸣事件不是单纯的个人事件，而是香港政府有计划的公开压迫留港进步人士的开端，这和我们人民政府保护守法英侨的公正而贤明的政策，显然是一个对照。香港政府应郑重考虑到他这种反动的压迫侨胞的政策所可能引起的后果。
