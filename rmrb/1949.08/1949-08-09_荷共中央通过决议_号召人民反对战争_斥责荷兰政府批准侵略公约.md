Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 8th: According to TASS, The Hague, August 6th: The Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party passed a resolution condemning the Dutch government's ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty and calling on the people to fight for peace. The resolution points out that due to the will of the ruling clique, the Netherlands has joined the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, which the Dutch people do not recognize. Huge military expenditures have caused the impoverishment of the Dutch people. The ever-expanding war in Indonesia is causing the Netherlands and the Indonesian people to waste more money and make more sacrifices. After emphasizing that the current Dutch government "serves the interests of the capitalists and the enemies of the working class," the resolution calls on all loyal democrats and all working people to unite and fight for the happiness and peace of all the people to answer the threat of the reactionaries to launch a new war. The resolution also demands the withdrawal of Dutch troops from Indonesia.

    【新华社北平八日电】据塔斯社海牙六日讯：荷兰共产党中央委员会通过决议，斥责荷兰政府批准北大西洋公约，号召人民为和平而战斗。决议指出：由于统治集团的意愿，荷兰已加入了荷兰人民所不承认的侵略性的北大西洋公约。庞大的军事开支，已造成了荷兰人民大众的贫困化。日趋扩大的在印尼的战争，使荷兰与印尼人民糜费更多的金钱和作更多的牺牲。决议在强调指出目前的荷兰政府是“为资本家的利益，为工人阶级的敌人的利益服务”以后，号召一切忠诚的民主分子与一切劳动人民团结起来，为全体人民幸福及和平而战，来回答反动派发动新战争的威胁。决议并要求撤退荷兰在印尼的军队。
