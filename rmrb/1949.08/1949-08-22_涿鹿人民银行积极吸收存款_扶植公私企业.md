　　[Zhuolu News] The Zhuolu branch of the People's Bank, when absorbing deposits, organized cadres to go to the streets to directly promote to various merchants. During the initial deposit promotion, many merchants were afraid to deposit their money, mistakenly thinking that "having money means struggle." Later, after propaganda and explanation, and illustrating that it was not for liquidation and struggle, but to regulate funds, develop production, prosper the economy, and benefit both sides, and at the same time, improved the interest rate and improved the working methods and attitude, the deposit business became increasingly developed.

　　In the past six months (January to June), the number of depositors reached 110, accounting for one-quarter of Zhuolu merchants, and the total deposits absorbed were 71,857,350 yuan.

　　The loan business amounted to 404,000 yuan in January and February, including 285,000 yuan for industrial loans and 119,000 yuan for commercial loans. In March and April, market currency circulation was tightened, and loans were suspended. Loans were resumed in May.

　　In the first half of the year (January to June), loans were issued 102 times, totaling 11,245,596 yuan. Loans to public enterprises were 6,426,596 yuan. Loans to private enterprises were 4,819,000 yuan; public and private industry, 4,893,000 yuan, public and private commerce, 6,352,596 yuan, public industry 573,000 yuan, private industry 4,320,000 yuan, public commerce 5,853,596 yuan, private commerce 499,000 yuan.

　　Because Zhuolu has very few public industries, the main target of industrial loans is private industry, while commercial loans still conform to the basic principle of prioritizing public over private.

　　涿鹿人民银行积极吸收存款
  　扶植公私企业
    【涿鹿讯】涿鹿支行吸收存款时，组织干部分头下街直接深入到各个商户宣传。在初次宣传存款时，有许多商人，有款也不敢存，误认为：“有钱就斗争”，后经过宣传解释并举例说明不是为了清算斗争，而是为了调剂资金、发展生产、繁荣经济、双方有利。同时，又提高了利率改善工作方式与态度，使存款业务日见开展。
    半年来（一至六月份）存款者达一百一十户，占涿鹿商户的四分之一，吸收存款共七一、八五七、三五○元。
    放款业务一、二两个月共放出四○四、○○○元，其中工业放款二八五、○○○元，商业放款一一九、○○○元，三四两个月紧缩市场货币流通量，曾停止放款，五月份又开始恢复放款。
    半年放款，（一至六月份）放款一○二次，共放出一一、二四五、五九六元。公营放款六、四二六、五九六元。私营放款，四、八一九、○○○元；公私工业，四、八九三、○○○元，公私商业，六、三五二、五九六元，公营工业五七三、○○○元，私营工业四、三二○、○○○元，公营商业五、八五三、五九六元，私营商业四九九、○○○元。
    因涿鹿公营工业很少，故工业贷款主要对象是私营工业，商业贷款，则仍符合先公后私的基本原则。
