Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 31st—The commercial delegation of the Northeast People's Democratic Government of China, headed by Gao Gang, has recently arrived in Moscow from the Northeast to hold negotiations on trade issues. As a result of successful negotiations, an agreement was reached on the mutual exchange of goods between the Northeast and the Soviet Union. The agreement is for a period of one year. The Northeast will sell soybeans, vegetable oil, corn, rice and other commodities to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union will sell industrial equipment, automobiles, kerosene, cloth, paper, medical equipment and other commodities to the Northeast. The delegation departed from Moscow on July 30 to return home.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st—Moscow Radio broadcast on the 30th: The Soviet people are very pleased to welcome the news about the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in China. The Soviet writer Nakayev said in a statement: The establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is an event of great historical significance. The two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, which together account for almost a quarter of the world's population, are making every effort to unite in the cause of defending peace. We, the Soviet writers, are pleased to feel that the Chinese people have a great interest in our culture. My books and the books of many Soviet writers have been translated into Chinese, and millions of Chinese people are reading them. The Soviet people also have a great interest in Chinese literature, and we are very willing to know about Chinese art, drama and literature. The works of Chinese writers Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Xiao San and other writers have also been translated into Russian; now Soviet magazines are publishing "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River" by the Chinese female writer Ding Ling. The Selected Works of the Chinese People's Leader Mao Zedong will soon be translated. Chinese art, porcelain and wood carvings are often exhibited in the Oriental Museum.

The famous Soviet poet Alf said: "Soviet writers are very excited and very satisfied to welcome the news of the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in China. The initiative of democratic Chinese social figures in this regard undoubtedly shows that the Chinese people are willing to be close to us, the Soviet people. We extend our warm greetings to the initiators and organizers of the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Now, no one can and nothing can prevent us from openly expressing our mutual love. The great Chinese people have now become the true masters of China's ancient civilization, and they will study and build a new culture—a new socialist culture—with all the valuable experience they have created in the past, and the Soviet Union is the cradle of this advanced society. We—the founders of socialism—are very happy to help the Chinese people's culture move forward in order to achieve the future happiness of the Chinese people. Soviet culture not only serves our people, but it has always served the peace and prosperity of the world, which is its essence and strength. We welcome the possibility of exchanging experiences with Chinese talented writers."

    【新华社北平一日电】莫斯科电台三十日广播：苏联人民非常欣喜地迎接关于中国成立中苏友好协会的消息。苏联作家那卡也夫发表谈话说：中苏友好协会的成立是有巨大历史意义的事件。差不多占全人类四分之一人口的中苏两个伟大的民族，在保卫和平事业上竭力联合一致。我们——苏联的作家，愉快地感觉到中国人民对我国文化发生很大兴趣。我和许多苏联作家的书籍被译成了中文，中国百万人民都在读着它们。苏联人民同时也对中国的文学发生极大的兴趣，我们很愿知道中国的美术、戏剧和文学。中国作家鲁迅、郭沫若、茅盾、萧三及其他作家的作品也都译成了俄文；现在苏联杂志正在登载中国女作家丁玲所著的“太阳照耀在桑乾河上”。中国人民领袖毛泽东的选集已快译完。在东方博物馆常常展览中国的美术、磁器和木刻。
    苏联著名诗人阿尔夫说：“苏联作家很兴奋地和非常满意地欢迎关于在中国成立中苏友好协会的消息。民主中国的社会人士在这方面的发起，无疑地表示中国人民愿意和我们苏联人民亲近。我们向成立中苏友好协会的发起者和组织者致以热忱的敬礼。现在，已经谁也不能并且什么东西也不能阻碍我们来公开表示我们互相友爱。伟大中国人民现在已变成了中国自古以来文明的真正主人，他们将以其过去创造的一切宝贵经验来研究建设新文化——社会主义新文化，而苏联就是这个先进社会的摇篮。我们——社会主义的创始人，很喜欢帮助中国人民的文化向前推进，以求中国人民达到未来的幸福。苏联文化不仅是为我国人民服务，而它在以前和现在都是为全世界的和平与繁荣服务的，这也就是他的本质和力量的所在。我们对于与中国天才作家之间有可能交换各自的经验表示欢迎。
