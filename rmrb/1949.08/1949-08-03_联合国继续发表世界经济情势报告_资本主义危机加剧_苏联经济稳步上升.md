Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 2nd – TASS, New York: The United Nations Secretariat recently published the second, third, and fourth parts of its World Economic Situation Report. Regardless of its many major shortcomings and deletions, this report provides a vivid picture of the sharpening crisis within the capitalist system.

The report points out that, with the exception of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, 1948 was a year of stagnation in the increase of postwar industrial and agricultural production in all countries around the world. The beginning of 1949 marked a sharp decline in industrial and agricultural production in all capitalist countries.

Sharp Decline in US Industrial Production; Deterioration of Latin American Economy

The report notes that the end of 1948, and especially the beginning of 1949, marked a decline in US production and exports. The increase in unemployment occurred not only in industry but also in agriculture.

In the second quarter of 1949, the decline in industrial production not only did not diminish but accelerated. In the period from April to June alone, the level of US industrial production, even according to official statistics, decreased by 10.5% from its postwar peak. Despite the Marshall Plan loans to foreign countries, US exports declined in 1948. Compared with 1947, US exports decreased by 18% in value and 23% in export volume.

The facts and statistics in the report regarding the economic situation in Latin America provide strong evidence that the activities of US monopoly capital, which were particularly intense during the postwar period, have driven these countries to a tragic plight. The decline in Latin American industrial production has coincided with a sharp drop in agricultural production. In 1948, Argentina's grain production fell by 27% compared to 1947, and feed production decreased by 38%. Brazil's coffee production in 1948 was 40% lower than the pre-war level. The sharp decline in agricultural production also occurred in Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and other Latin American countries. Accompanying the decline in agricultural production was a sharp drop in the export of Latin American commodities and agricultural products, which faced strong competition from US commodities in the world market. As a result, in 1948 and early 1949, Argentina was forced to reduce its grain exports (mainly wheat) by half. The trend of inflation in Latin America has been extremely sharp during the postwar period, which has allowed capitalists to increase their profits.

Near East and Africa: Severe Inflation and Famine

The report's statistics on the economic situation in the Near East and African countries similarly reaffirm that foreign monopoly capital’s insatiable exploitation of these countries' natural resources and the immense profits gained from the ruthless exploitation of indigenous peoples. Although the Near East countries were not directly affected by World War II, agricultural production in these countries in 1948 barely reached pre-war levels. This was the case in Iran and Iraq. The trend of inflation in the Near East and African countries has worsened the situation of the indigenous peoples in these countries, and it is particularly difficult at present. The price increases in 1948 (compared to 1939) were: 2.8 times in Egypt, 6.6 times in Iran, almost 6 times in Iraq, 4.8 times in Lebanon and Syria, and 3.5 times in Turkey. Hunger is particularly severe for the people of Africa. In the years since the war, the harvest of agricultural products in Africa has not been bad, but the consumption of agricultural products per person has decreased and "remains the lowest level in the world." This phenomenon is the result of the colonial powers—Britain, France, and Belgium—increasing the export of agricultural products from their African colonies and trust territories.

Sharp Decline in Production and Sharp Increase in Unemployment in Western Europe

The report, when discussing the economic situation in European countries, pointed out that in the first three months of 1949, industrial and agricultural production in European countries (with the exception of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies) was declining. In the first quarter of 1949, industrial production in Western European countries was lower than in the same quarter of last year. In the first quarter of 1949, the number of unemployed in Western European countries increased sharply, doubling in just the first three months. In some countries, the increase was even more rapid. The number of unemployed in the first quarter of 1949 compared with 1948 was as follows: Austria increased from 54,600 to 138,700, Belgium from 82,000 to 175,200, Denmark from 27,600 to 48,400, Finland increased to five and a half times that of 1948, the number of registered unemployed workers in Germany doubled and a half during this period, and the number of unemployed in the US-British occupation zone of Germany almost doubled, reaching a total of 1,019,000. Italy had 2,182,100 unemployed, the Netherlands doubled, Norway increased by nearly one time, and Switzerland increased by nearly three times. In 1949, agricultural production in Western European countries (agricultural production in most Western European countries has not even reached pre-war levels) began to decline, even though these countries continue to feel the lack of bread, butter, fat, and other agricultural products.

### 联合国继续发表世界经济情势报告  资本主义危机加剧  苏联经济稳步上升

    联合国继续发表世界经济情势报告
    资本主义危机加剧
    苏联经济稳步上升
    【新华社北平二日电】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国秘书处最近发表世界经济情况报告的第二、第三、第四部分。姑不论其中的许多主要缺点和删节，这个报告却提供了一幅资本主义体系中危机尖锐化的生动图画。
    报告指出：除苏联和东欧国家以外，在全世界一切国家的战后工业与农业生产的增加上，一九四八年是迟滞的一年。一九四九年初，则标志着一切资本主义国家工业与农业生产的急趋下降。
  美工业生产急剧下降  拉丁美洲经济恶化
    报告指出：一九四八年底，特别是一九四九年初，标志着美国生产和出口的下降。失业的增加不仅发生在工业上，而且发生在农业上。
    在一九四九年的第二季中，工业生产量的下降不但没有减少，反而是加速了。单是四月至六月这一期间，美国的工业生产水平，甚至根据官方的统计，即比战后的最高峰减低了百分之十点五。尽管美国有马歇尔计划对外国的贷款，但是，一九四八年美国的出口还是下降了，这一年的美国出口与一九四七年相比，在价值上减少了百分之十八，在出口额上减少了百分之二十三。
    报告中关于拉丁美洲经济情况的事实和统计，提供了有力的证据，说明在战后期间特别紧张的美国垄断资本的活动，已经驱使这些国家走上悲惨的境遇。与拉丁美洲工业生产品的减少同时发生的，是农业生产品的锐降。一九四八年，阿根廷的谷物生产较四七年跌落了百分之二十七，饲料生产减少了百分之三十八。巴西的咖啡生产，在一九四八年度比战前水平降低了百分之四十。农业生产的锐减，亦在墨西哥、智利、哥伦比亚及其他拉丁美洲国家发生。与农业生产减少相随而来的，是拉丁美洲商品及农产品出口的锐降，它们的出口在世界市场中遇到了美国商品的强烈竞争。因此，在一九四八年及一九四九年初，阿根廷被迫将谷物出口（主要是小麦）减少了一半。拉丁美洲通货膨胀的趋势，在战后期间表现得极为尖锐，这使得资本家增加了他们的利润。
    近东及非洲  通货膨胀饥饿严重
    该报告关于近东及非洲国家经济局势的统计数字，同样再度证实：外国垄断资本对这些国家天然富源贪得无厌的剥削，和靠着对土著人民作无情剥削而获得巨额的利润。虽然近东的国家未受到第二次世界大战的直接影响，但是，一九四八年，这些国家的农业生产几乎不能达到战前的水平。伊朗和伊拉克就是如此。近东及非洲国家通货膨胀的趋势，已经使这些国家土著人民的处境恶化，而在目前更是特别的困难。一九四八年物价的上涨（与一九三九年比较）：埃及为二·八倍，伊朗为六·六倍，伊拉克差不多涨了六倍，黎巴嫩及叙利亚涨了四·八倍，在土耳其涨了三·五倍。非洲人民所受的饥饿特别严重。战后几年来，非洲农产品的收成并不坏，但是，每人的农产品消费量却减少了，目前，“仍是世界上最低的水平”。这种现象是因为殖民地宗主国——英、法、比增加了非洲殖民地和托管地对外出口的结果。
    西欧各国生产急降失业剧增
    报告谈到欧洲国家的经济形势时指出：一九四九年头三个月，欧洲各国（只有苏联和人民民主国家例外）的工业和农业生产都在下降中。一九四九年第一季，西欧各国的工业生产量都较去年同一季低落。一九四九年第一季，西欧各国的失业人数急剧增加，仅在头三个月中，失业即已倍增。在某些国家中，增加得还更为急剧。一九四九年第一季，失业人数与一九四八年比较如下：奥地利自五万四千六百人增至十三万八千七百人，比利时自八万二千人增至十七万五千二百人，丹麦自二万七千六百人增至四万八千四百人，芬兰增加到一九四八年的五倍半，德国在这一时期登记的失业工人增加了一倍半，而德境美英占领区的失业者几乎倍增，共达一百零一万九千人。意大利的失业者达二百一十八万二千一百人，荷兰失业者倍增，挪威增加近一倍，瑞士增加近三倍。一九四九年，西欧各国的农业生产（大部分西欧国家的农业生产甚至还没有达到战前水平）开始降落，虽然这些国家仍继续感到面包、牛油、脂肪和其他农产品的缺乏。
