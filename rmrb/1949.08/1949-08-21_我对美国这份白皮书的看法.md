　　My Views on the US White Paper
　　Huang Yanpei
　　After reading all the abridged versions of the US White Paper on US-China Relations and Acheson's letter to Truman that I have on hand, I didn't feel much different. The letter stated that the US only had three paths to take regarding China: first, to completely ignore it; second, to use strong military force to assist Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang in defeating the Communist Party; and third, to advocate for cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, taking this opportunity to help Chiang become strong. It chose the third path, and now it has failed. This is the general idea of what he said. I had long expected it to fail. Because I saw its approach clearly. Of course, the third path was not a path at all, and what was it actually taking? On the surface, it was the third path, but secretly it was taking the second. On the surface, Hurley and Marshall successively advised both sides to negotiate peacefully, and Marshall even advised the CCP to hand over a large part of its army to be incorporated into the National Army. These appearances all seemed to be for peace, but in its heart, it had already stated that since the victory over Japan, the US had given the National Government a total of two billion US dollars in grants or loans, plus war surplus materials worth more than one billion, only taking 232.2 million US dollars (which is another 768 million US dollars, totaling more than 2.768 billion US dollars.) Isn't this what he said was the second path of providing massive assistance to Chiang Kai-shek to achieve the goal of defeating the Communist Party! I have been involved in every dispute in the past few years. Especially all the meetings and talks from the beginning to the end of 1946, I have never missed one. With my calm mind, I saw it clearly. I personally cannot help but say a few words here:
　　We only know that the ceasefire agreement in January 1946 and the convening of the Political Consultative Conference were facilitated by Marshall; the signing of the troop reduction and demobilization plan in February was also facilitated by Marshall; the ceasefire and peace talks in June were even personally participated in by Marshall; Chiang Kai-shek's superficial peace talks and secret dispatch of troops were repeatedly dissuaded by Marshall, but without noticing that the US assisted in transporting Chiang Kai-shek's troops to the Northeast, which was also during Marshall's tenure in China, and the self-incriminating public report in this letter of massive aid to Chiang, totaling more than 2.768 billion US dollars, wasn't that also during Marshall's tenure! Marshall's implementation of the US imperialist policy was intended to strengthen Chiang's power, but not to have him rush to send troops to fight the Communist Party, but to wait until a considerable time before sending troops. Chiang, on the other hand, overestimated himself, thinking that with so much US aid, defeating the Communist Party would not be a problem. Marshall's disagreement with the US imperialist policy was limited to this point. Later, when Chiang gradually became unsustainable, he simply continued to provide aid. The more he fought, the more he lost, and when he was completely defeated, he calculated and found that the accumulated numbers were so large, and he could not hide it from the inside and outside, so he had this annoyed and embarrassed expression. This is the truth of the matter. So, it is important to recognize clearly that anti-Soviet and anti-Communist are the basic national policies of US imperialism. The US imperialism's dissatisfaction with Chiang is not a question of whether to fight the CCP or not, but when is the appropriate time to send troops. Unexpectedly, the killing weapons, once in Chiang's hands, were wielded and fiddled with indiscriminately, absolutely not listening to US imperialism's words. US imperialism's annoyance is on this point. The result of indiscriminate wielding and fiddling is that all the weapons ended up in the hands of the Communist Party, which helped the Communist Party grow stronger. US imperialism's annoyance and embarrassment are on this point.
　　The term "democratic individualism" is already ridiculous enough, and it is even more absurd to use it to insult various political parties.
　　Where is the main reason for US imperialism's failure? I'm afraid it still doesn't understand it today. It only realizes that Chiang Kai-shek is a big wolf that cannot be chained. I mistakenly trusted him, and I failed. But it doesn't know that the main reason for the failure is that it looks down on the Chinese people too much. It thought that on the one hand, it could strengthen Chiang's power for its use, and on the other hand, it only needed to use fake democratic methods to deceive the Chinese people, so that they would obediently obey Chiang, let Chiang use a large number of killing weapons obtained from US aid to suppress the people, and use fake democracy, that is, the individualism democracy mentioned in the letter, to perfunctorily deal with them. In the middle, it also wanted to rely on the "democratic individualism" parties to perform a supporting role for a while, and China could be peaceful, and when it came to fighting the Soviet Union, under the command of the house slave Chiang Kai-shek, it could be dispatched by my US imperialism. This is really a US imperialist dream. Just imagine, what does US imperialism think of us Chinese people? The term "democratic individualism" in the middle is already ridiculous enough, and it is even more absurd to use it to insult our various political parties. Of course, there will be a group of muddleheads who are happy to play supporting roles. Sometimes they kowtow to the master, and are even kicked in the boots by the master.
　　The matter is very clear. May I ask, among the things worth more than 2.768 billion US dollars, the large number of killing weapons contained in them, in the past three years, directly and indirectly, haven't they all been Chinese people who have been sacrificed under these weapons! In my opinion, fortunately, they quickly fell into the hands of the Communist Party. The Kuomintang army escaped quickly and surrendered quickly, which reduced the number of killings. Otherwise, I don't know how many hundreds of thousands or millions more people would have been killed! Although the Chinese people are kind and tolerant, they are clear about gratitude and grudges. Every life sacrificed will be clearly written in the US imperialist account, without mistakes or omissions.
　　There is another important reason why I predicted that this policy of US imperialism would inevitably fail. To speak frankly, what US imperialism has a lot of are materials and weapons, the latter are directly killing people, and the former can also be used to indirectly kill people. And what it values and cherishes most is the lives of its own people—not because US imperialism values and cherishes the lives of its own people, but only because the life of its government, at a certain time, will fall into the hands of its own people—so it can only play with other people's people as cannon fodder. Which family's people should it play with? In the East, of course, it first looks to our China. Chiang Kai-shek used the large number of killing weapons aided by it to kill a part of the anti-imperialist Chinese—the Chinese Communist Party and those who sympathize with the Communist Party. If they could be killed, of course, US imperialism would also applaud and welcome it. The result is failure. If, according to its plan, one day it actually sends Chinese people to kill those outside of China who they do not want to kill, are unwilling to kill, and consider friendly anti-imperialists, I dare say that the result will be the same failure. Because the people of all countries in the world have tasted the flavor of imperialism. Especially the Chinese people have tasted it enough for more than a hundred years. The people who use your weapons fundamentally do not have their hearts set on you, so what can be done?
　　Speaking of this, we Chinese people still need to recognize one thing clearly. General imperialism is limited to economically and invisibly exploiting our flesh and blood, while American imperialism, in addition to these, also wants to physically and massively sacrifice our lives militarily.
　　US imperialism has a second attempt in progress, which is that in addition to playing with the lives of my Chinese people, it is also playing with the lives of the Japanese people. Then I dare to say that the possibility of this failure is even greater! Doesn't US imperialism know that the Japanese people are also awakening day by day and standing up one by one! I'm afraid that once troops are sent, before the victory or defeat is decided, they will turn around and stage a second Pearl Harbor incident. Originally, this plan of it was extremely clever. Victory is mine, and life is someone else's. Unfortunately, there are very few such cheap things in the world.
　　Solemnly Warn US Imperialism That All Roads of Aggression Are Impassable
　　I dare to solemnly warn US imperialism that if you never put the broad masses of the people in your eyes, the second path, clearly taking it is impassable, and secretly taking it is even more impassable. What will be the result? No path will be passable. I am also afraid that the problem is "not in Zhuanyu, but within the wall." The American people themselves are also awakening day by day and standing up one by one. US imperialism! I am afraid that your final life will not end in the hands of anti-imperialists outside your country, but will end under the feet of anti-imperialists within your country, if you never put the broad masses of the people in your eyes.

### 我对美国这份白皮书的看法

　　我对美国这份白皮书的看法
    黄炎培
    我读了手头所有美对华关系白皮书节本和艾奇逊给杜鲁门的信以后，没有发生多少异感，信中所说美对华只有三条路可走：第一条、是完全不管，第二条、是用强大的军事力量援助蒋介石所领导的国民党来击败共产党，第三条、唱出国共合作，借这个机会助蒋使之强大，它选择了第三条，现在是失败了。这些是他所说许多话中间的大意。在我是早料定它要失败的。因为我看清楚了它的做法，当然，第三条路，本来也不是路，而况它所走的，是什么呢，表面是第三条路，暗中却在走第二条。表面由赫尔利马歇尔先后劝双方和平协商，马歇尔还劝中共交出大部军队编入国军，这些表面，好象都是为了和平，骨子里他已经自己说明，从对日胜利后，美用赠予或借贷方式给国民政府总数达二十亿美元，加上战余物资值到十亿以上，仅取价二亿三千二百万美元，（那又是七亿六千八百万元以上，共达二十七亿六千八百万元以上。）这些不就是他所说第二条大量援助蒋介石使达到打败共产党的目的吗！我在这几年纠纷事件当中，没有一件不与闻的。尤其是一九四六年从头到尾所有会议，会谈，没有离开过一次。用我冷静的头脑，看得清清楚楚了，我个人在这里不能不说几句：
    我们只知道一九四六那年一月间的停战协定，召开政协，是马歇尔所加功促成的；二月间整军复员方案的签订，也是马歇尔加功促成的；六月间的停战和谈，马歇尔且亲身参与的；蒋介石的表面谈和，暗里出兵，马歇尔曾经多次加以劝阻的，而没有注意到美国协助输送蒋介石军队到东北，也是马歇尔在华任内的事，而不打自招地这信上公开报告大量援蒋，合计达二十七亿六千八百万美元以上，还不同样是马歇尔任内的事吗！马歇尔所执行美帝政策，本意是要强大蒋的力量，而不要他急急出兵打共产党，要等待到相当时间然后出兵，蒋呢，估计自己太高，以为有了这般多的美援，打垮共产党，是不成问题的。马歇尔执行美帝政策所不同意的，只限于这一点。等到后来，蒋渐渐不支了，那只有索兴继续援下去，后来越打越败，到一败涂地时，结算一下，发见堆积起来的数字，竟达那么之多，而对内对外，又不容许他掩饰过去，才有这懊恼而又狼狈的表示。这才是个中的真相。所以要认识清楚，反苏反共，是美帝的基本国策，美帝的不满意于蒋，问题不是在对中共要打不要打，而是在到什么时候出兵，才是相宜。料不到杀人武器，一到蒋手，便乱舞乱弄起来，绝对不听美帝的话，美帝的懊恼，在这点上。乱舞乱弄的结果，弄得武器全入共产党手中，结果助长了共产党，美帝的懊恼而又狼狈，在这点上。
　　“民主个人主义”名词已够滑稽拿来侮辱各党派更是不成话
    美帝之所以失败，主因在哪里呢？怕到今天它自己还没有了解。它只觉悟到蒋介石是一头铁链所锁不住的大狼。我错信了他，我失败了。而不知失败的主因，是在它太看不起中国的老百姓。它以为一方面强大了蒋的力量，以为我用，一方面只须用假民主方式可以哄骗中国老百姓，使得他们服服贴贴地对蒋，让蒋一手拿着从美援得来的大量的杀人武器来镇压老百姓，一手用假民主即信中所称个人主义的民主来敷衍。中间还想仰仗“民主个人主义”的各党派来演一阵跑龙套，中国便可以太平无事，到要对苏作战时，在家奴蒋介石指挥之下，都可以供我美帝差遣，这真是美帝的美梦。试想美帝当我们中国老百姓是什么呢？中间“民主个人主义”一名词已够滑稽了，拿来侮辱我们各党派更不成话。当然自会有一群糊涂虫，他们乐于跑龙套。有时向主子磕头，还给主子踢了一下靴脚。
    事情是很明白的，试问这价值达二十七亿六千八百万美元以上东西中间所大量包含着的杀人武器，在这三年多中间，直接间接，被牺牲在这些武器之下，还不都是中国人吗！以我看来，幸而快快落到共产党手中，国民党军队逃跑得快，投降得快，还少杀些，否则不知还要多杀几百千万人哩！中国老百姓虽然仁厚宽容，恩怨是分明的，每一条被牺牲的生命，都会明明白白写在美帝帐上，不会错误的，不会忽略的。
    我所以料定美帝这一政策必然失败，倒还有一个重大原因。打开后壁说亮话，美帝所很有而且很多的，是物资和武器，后者是直接杀人的，前者也可以拿来间接杀人。而它所最宝贵最痛惜的，是它老百姓的生命——不是美帝会宝贵痛惜它老百姓的生命，只为了它政府的生命，在某一时间，会落在它老百姓手里——所以它只有玩弄人家老百姓当炮灰。玩弄哪一家老百姓呢？在东方当然首先看中我们中国，蒋介石把它援助来的大量的杀人武器来杀一部分反帝的中国人——中国共产党和同情于共产党的人，如果杀得了，当然也是美帝所鼓掌欢迎的，结果是失败了。如果照它计划，有一天竟差遣中国老百姓去杀他们所不愿杀，不肯杀而且引为友好的中国以外的反帝者，其结果我敢断言同样的失败。因为帝国主义的味儿，世界各国老百姓都尝过。尤其是中国老百姓一百多年来已经尝得尽够尽够。使用你武器的人，根本上他们的心不向着你，还有什么办法？
    说到这里，我中国老百姓还要认清楚一点，一般帝国主义，是限于在经济上无形地敲剥我们的血肉，而美国帝国主义，除了这些以外，同时还要在军事上有形地而且大量地断送我们的生命。
    美帝还有第二企图，在进行中，就是除掉玩弄我中国老百姓生命之外，还在玩弄日本老百姓的生命，那我更敢断言，这失败的可能性更大哩！美帝还不知日本老百姓也在一天一天觉醒，一个一个站起来么！怕一旦出兵，胜败还没有决，就会回过头来，演出第二珍珠港事件。本来它这种打算，是再巧妙不过的，胜利是我的，生命是人家的。可惜世界上很少这种便宜的事。
  　正告美帝国主义侵略道路条条不通
    我敢正告美帝，如果你永远不把广大的人民放在眼里，第二条路，明走既不通，暗走更不通，结果是什么路都走不通。我还怕问题是“不在颛臾，而在萧墙之内”，美国自己的老百姓，同样地一天一天在觉醒，一个一个在站起来，美帝乎！怕你最后的生命，不结束在你国门以外反帝者的手里，会结束在你国门以内反帝者的脚下，如果你永远不把广大的人民放在眼里的话。
