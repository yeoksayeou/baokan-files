Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th: TASS, New York, 7th: "American newspapers are trying hard to convince the American people that the end of the economic downturn is in sight, and a turnaround will follow. Last week, Business Week and U.S. News & World Report published similar news, saying that the President's Council of Economic Advisers reported to Truman that the economic situation had improved. According to Business Week, although the President's Council of Economic Advisers told Truman that the economic trend had reversed, according to the Council's preliminary estimates, the Federal Reserve Board's industrial production index for July will fall by another four to six points. This will bring the industrial production index down to 163, in other words, in a short period of eight months, production has fallen by more than 16 percent. Although Business Week optimistically insists that the decline of four to six points is not as drastic as originally expected, many observers expect the economy to continue to decline. Mr. Salbach, Vice President of the major statistical agency "Standard & Poor's Corporation," published an article in the New York World Telegram on August 1, predicting that production in the autumn will be further tightened, and factory construction and exports will decline sharply. Some economists in Washington also hold the same view as Salbach. The "Economic Chronicle" report published in August by the progressive Labor Research Association also predicts that the economic downturn will deepen further. The report declared: "Although some business people have issued optimistic remarks that the 'recession' has 'eased,' such remarks do not put forward fundamental factors that can indicate that the developing crisis will not reach a serious level." The statistics recently published undoubtedly do not confirm the optimistic predictions issued by American newspapers at the behest of others. Steel production continued to decline this week, only playing 81.3 percent of the total steel industry's production capacity, which is about 20 percent lower than the level in mid-March. According to a survey by the New York Times, department store sales in New York City in July decreased by 19 percent compared with the same month last year. Bituminous coal production is much lower than last year. Bituminous coal production in the week ending July 30 decreased by 41.6 percent compared with the same week last year. Coal production in the first seven months of this year decreased by 16.6 percent compared with the same period last year. The number of bankrupt small businesses is increasing. The "Dun & Bradstreet" statistical agency reported that 4,581 companies went bankrupt in the first half of this year, with debts exceeding 232.2 million yuan. In the first half of last year, only 2,543 companies went bankrupt, with debts of only 97 million yuan.

    竭力掩饰危机亦属徒劳
    美国经济继续衰退
    今年上半年四千五百余公司破产
    八个月来生产跌落了百分之十六
    【新华社北平九日电】塔斯社纽约七日讯“美国报纸竭力想使美国人民相信：经济跌落的终结已经在望，随后就会有转机。在上周，商业周刊及美国新闻与世界报告发表类似的消息说：总统经济顾问委员会向杜鲁门报告：经济局势已有改善。据商业周刊称：总统经济顾问委员会虽然告诉杜鲁门说经济趋势已经扭转，但据该委员会的初步估计，联邦准备局七月份的工业生产指数，将再下降四点至六点。这将使工业生产指数降到一六三，换句话说，在短短的八个月期间，生产下降了百分之十六以上。尽管商业周刊乐观地硬说：下降四点至六点并没有原来预料的那样急剧，但许多观察家预料：经济将继续衰退下去。大统计机关“史坦德与普尔斯公司”的副主席萨尔巴赫八月一日在纽约世界电讯发表一篇文章，预言秋季的生产将更加紧缩，工厂建筑与出口将锐降。华盛顿有一些经济学家亦抱有和萨尔巴赫同样的见解。进步的劳工研究协会八月出版的“经济纪事”汇报也预测经济跌落将更为加深。该汇报宣称：“尽管一些企业界的人发出‘衰退’已经‘缓和’的乐观言论，但是在这种言论中并没有提出能够表明发展中的危机不会达到严重程度的带根本性的因素来。”最近发表的统计数字无疑并不能证实美国报纸在他人授意下发出乐观的预测。钢生产本周继续下降，仅发挥钢业总生产能力的百分之八十一点三，比三月中旬的水平约降低百分之二十。根据纽约时报的调查，纽约市百货公司七月份的销售量比去年同月降低了百分之十九。烟煤生产较去年大为低落。烟煤生产在到七月三十日为止的一周中，比去年同周下降了百分之四十一点六。今年头七个月煤的生产比去年同一个时期降低了百分之十六点六。小企业破产的数目在增加着。“邓·布列斯特”统计机关报告：本年上半年度有四千五百八十一家公司破产，负债超出二亿三千二百万元。而去年上半年度，只有二千五百四十三家公司破产，负债数目仅九千七百万元。
