On the Technical Problems of Actors
　　Liu Nianqu
　　Introduction
    "The motive of serving the masses is inseparable from the effect of being welcomed by the masses, and the two must be unified."
    "Our requirement is the unity of politics and art, the unity of content and form, and the unity of revolutionary political content with the highest possible artistic form. A work of art that lacks artistry, no matter how progressive it is politically, is powerless."
    As we accept this teaching, in drama, in drama that serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers, stage art should not be neglected. That is to say, we should learn and study how to use highly skilled and excellent stage art to perfectly and correctly express revolutionary political content. In stage art, the actor's acting skills are an important part of it. Previous experimental experience and theory are not lacking, but it seems that there is still a lack of summarization and development. Here, based on what I have seen in the theater in the past six months, I will try to write out a few small topics that I have thought of by chance for everyone to discuss. I hope to receive serious instructions on errors and omissions!
　　One: The Self-Training of Actors
    Suppose there is such a friend who has received two or three years of basic performance training in a certain drama school and has had many internship opportunities, or he has been participating in a certain cultural troupe for several years and has occasionally played one of the masses, an unimportant character, or an occasionally assigned protagonist. Generally speaking, he is an actor, or even may be considered a promising actor. In addition to actors who have already achieved great accomplishments – performing artists – we welcome and need such actors. In fact, there are a large number of such actors today.
    There is no need to ask, every such actor hopes to make rapid progress in his acting skills and truly become a performing artist. This hope is reasonable, correct, should be had, and must be had.
    In order to make rapid progress, more stage practice is very necessary. Drama cannot be without actors, and actors cannot be without a stage. But what I want to say here is something outside the stage.
    Outside the stage, let's also exclude the work in the rehearsal room. What's left is life and learning. Life is collective, regular, and also tense and busy, which will not hinder but can help the actor's progress. Learning is something that everyone should seriously work hard on, and actors are of course included. In cultural troupes, the content of learning is often very rich: ideological study, professional study, policy study, as well as criticism and self-criticism. We know that the vast majority of actors have not rejected this kind of learning, and the results of learning are also obvious. But what I want to say here is something other than the above-mentioned life and learning.
    What else can there be besides life and learning? Yes, there should be nothing else. What I want to say is something within the general or above-mentioned life and learning that is often neglected by actors – self-training, that is, the training of the actor's tools (including the body and the thoughts, feelings, temperament, and creative imagination ability derived from the body).
    Self-training is a top priority for any actor, including actors who have already achieved great accomplishments, and it is something that must be carried out regularly. Let's compare actors to soldiers, and the body, etc., are the soldiers' weapons. Are there any soldiers who do not regularly pay attention to, cherish, check, and wipe their weapons? If there are, they must be criticized soldiers.
    Self-training is not an individual activity that is detached from the collective. Conducting it in a group may achieve greater results. If this is not possible for the time being, it can also be done alone. According to the specific needs of drama – acting skills, the body and the ability of thought, emotion, temperament, and creative imagination, first of all, must be fully adapted to this specific need. Having a very healthy and normally developed muscular body can certainly show off one's skills on the sports field, but it is not enough to move it to the stage. The latter requires proper, specialized training, and this training must be continuously continued. Studying Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, for actors, after combining it with art, must be further combined with acting skills, such as how to use the principles of Marxist dialectics to understand, grasp, and express the characters in the play, and how to critically absorb Stanislavski's performance system – to make it Chinese. This is the actor's task. Similarly, emotions, temperament, and the ability of creative imagination all need regular exercise. The standard of adaptation, I think, should be to make the tool completely free to use, that is, completely obedient to the actor's own command and control, and easy to use. Then, it is required to further develop the tool, that is, to gradually strengthen the breadth and depth of free use. Compared with an ordinary Soviet Communist Party member, creating such two characters as Lenin on the stage undoubtedly requires more and more demanding things from the actor. It is not only because Lenin is a particularly great person, but mainly because the actor must express his lofty spirit and profound thoughts to be considered qualified.
    In self-training, the body, etc., cannot be separated and isolated. The important thing is how to express the specific thoughts, emotions, temperament, and creative imagination ability used for creating a certain character through the body – the activities of nerves and muscles, that is, the so-called expressions and actions, so that the audience can get a clear understanding. That is to say, one must be accustomed to: what one thinks and how one thinks in the head is conveyed to the outside through the material body. It is not enough to just "know it in the heart" or "understand it yourself." This is not something that can be achieved overnight. One or two years can establish a foundation, and three or five years can achieve significant results. Moreover, one should act until old and exercise until old.
　　Two: Knowing Characters and Expressing Characters
    The relationship between an actor and a certain character he (or she) plays is like making friends. You can hit it off at first sight, or you can start off not getting along very well. You have to rely on constant interaction for a considerable period of time, especially the contact between two hearts – two souls – to become bosom friends who will never change until death.
    Since the characters in the play are not specific friends who exist in real life, the actor needs to seek a more reasonable method to contact him or her, in order to avoid detours and seek a comprehensive and deep understanding, grasp, and expression, and complete the task of creating the character. I think that being able to use the principles of Marxist dialectics in acting skills will greatly help this work.
    The actor has read the script seven times, both appreciatively and studyingly; paying attention to the whole play and also paying attention to a certain character he plays – such as Zeng Hao in "Peking Man" – and then writing down everything about Zeng Hao in detail in a notebook, including what the script stipulates and what the actor himself imagines and designs, or writing a detailed biography or diary for Zeng Hao. Maybe all of this is kept in the actor's mind, without writing down a single word. This varies from person to person, and all are adoptable means. The question is: how to understand (and then grasp and express) everything about Zeng Hao?
    First, one should understand, grasp, and express it from the internal connection between this character and the environment that produced this character, and from the connection, mutual dependence, and mutual restraint between this character and other characters. For example, Zeng Hao, who is selfish and self-interested like Argan (the protagonist of Moliere's "The Miser"), has a feeling of mourning for the deceased like Mrs. Ranevskaya (the heroine of Chekhov's "The Cherry Orchard"), and is somewhat like Granny Jia in "Dream of the Red Chamber" in some ways, is a character in a declining feudal society. His thoughts and feelings are closely linked to the past glory and splendor, and also closely linked to the current decline and poverty. His selfishness is precisely expressed through his relationship with Sifang and others. The more Sifang obeys, the more it sets off Zeng Hao's selfishness. That is to say, the actor cannot grasp a certain characteristic of the character and isolate it. When examining this connection at the beginning, one should also distinguish between the essential, necessary, deep, organic connection and the non-essential, accidental, superficial, unimportant connection, grasp the former tightly, and filter out the latter. Also, the fact that Zeng Wenqing hides in his room to smoke opium is an essential, necessary, deep, organic connection to Zeng Hao. From here, Zeng Hao's mentality of hating iron for not becoming steel and the disappointment of the family's inability to revive are expressed.
    Second, one should understand, grasp, and express it from the movement and development of this character. It is already written like this in the script. Zeng Hao does not express all of his character as soon as he appears, but gradually expresses it as the plot progresses – the progress of his own actions, thoughts, and feelings in this environment of dealing with people and things. His feeling of mourning for the deceased may have been lurking in his heart for many years. Only when he sees how his son is not up to par, how the family has disputes, and how it is about to completely decline does he express it to his children. If the actor ignores this line of development, it will inevitably appear abrupt later. There is an even more obvious example. Hesitation is the basis of Hamlet's entire character (Shakespeare's "Hamlet"). The actor must recognize this point. However, it cannot be regarded as a solidified character. This character is undergoing countless changes, ups and downs, and struggles – never-ending movement and development, heading towards the climax of the tragedy. The character's personality is revealed in this continuous movement and change, continuous renewal and development, and presents diverse brilliance because of the movement and development.
    Third, one should understand, grasp, and express it from the kind of change in a character's actions, thoughts, and feelings from small, hidden quantitative changes to open, fundamental qualitative changes. The changes in actions, thoughts, and feelings that seem sudden to the audience, except for the fact that the script is written so suddenly, all have this process of change from small, hidden quantitative changes to open, fundamental qualitative changes. The actor should dig it out from between the lines. In "Peking Man," we once saw Zeng Hao kneel down to his son after discovering that Zeng Wenqing was still hiding in his room to smoke opium, saying: "You are the father, I am the son, I kneel down to you..." Zeng Wenqing dropped the opium pipe in his hand and ran out. Zeng Hao's kneeling is very important. It fully expresses his love and expectation for his son, as well as the anxiety and hatred transformed from love and expectation. If the actor ignores the series of changes before this, no matter how "like" or natural, skilled, and vivid he plays, it will inevitably have a sense of suddenness, and there will inevitably be elements of affectation. If the actor intends to avoid affectation, he must seriously consider the series of changes before this: from the impression Zeng Wenqing's preparation to go out to do things while the remaining stains of smoke on his fingers gave Zeng Hao and the impact it had on his heart, every action of Zeng Wenqing in his mind is a factor that causes small, hidden quantitative changes. Then, this emotional change is reached: love turns into hate. Without specifically marking this line, the performance will become fragmented and affected.
    Fourth, one should understand, grasp, and express it from a character's internal contradictions and internal struggles. Let's still talk about Zeng Hao. As mentioned earlier, his selfishness is precisely expressed through his relationship with Sifang and others. The more Sifang obeys, the more it sets off Zeng Hao's selfishness. Here, further analysis is needed. Zeng Hao's selfishness is also expressed in the contradiction of his own thoughts. On the one hand, he uses what he thinks are good reasons to dissuade Sifang from marrying, wanting to keep her by his side until he dies; on the other hand, he knows that this is unreasonable and difficult to fully achieve, but his words and actions are almost stubbornly trying to keep her. The struggle is going on in his heart, which strengthens the selfishness that is expressed. Not only Zeng Hao, but also Sifang and Zeng Wenqing each have their own internal contradictions and internal struggles in their own actions, thoughts, and feelings, thereby strengthening the goodness, weakness, fantasy, complacency, and great pain of being confined in this "prison" that are expressed. Hamlet's character relies more on his internal contradictions and internal struggles. The famous "To be or not to be..." soliloquy expresses this, and the scene when Hamlet wanted to kill the king when he was praying but stopped also expresses this. It is this unresolved internal contradiction and internal struggle that constitutes the foundation of his hesitant character and is emphatically expressed through the revealing of internal contradictions and internal struggles.
    I have to admit that the method described here is actually the method that our excellent actors have consciously or unconsciously used, at most, it is just that they have not applied all of it. I think that for any character, it is necessary and possible to understand, grasp, and express it from the above four points, perhaps with slight differences in weight.
    Understanding, grasping, and expressing are not three clearly separable stages in the process of creating a character. This is actually the development of the interaction and mutual penetration of the character's actions, thoughts, and feelings – the character's personality and the character's actions, or it can be said to be the development of the unity of content and form. With an initial outline and a line from beginning to end, the actor can stipulate the various details of expressing the character. The details must be characteristic, not naturalistic trivialities. Should Huang Shengsan ("Sunrise") be a little hunchbacked? Okay, let him be a little hunchbacked. However, the actor must make the audience understand that Huang Shengsan's hunchback is the result of working at his desk for many years for twelve yuan and eighty-five cents a month, not caused by other reasons or born with. This difference is subtle, and the brilliance of acting skills is embodied in the subtle details.
    From understanding a character to expressing a character on the stage, it requires technology, it requires a certain form. Simply imitating real life is not enough, but it is rooted in and starts from real life. Facing diverse and complex real life, actors need to learn and experience seriously and deeply, and they also need to give full play to their imagination and creativity on the basis of the harvest of learning and experience. Selection and refinement are necessary efforts. Through selection and refinement, the most authentic, representative, and typical, personalized expression can be achieved.
    We call this kind of acting skills realistic acting skills. Realistic acting skills always oppose imitation, oppose uniformity, oppose rigidity, oppose almost, oppose affectation, oppose superficiality, and pursue truth, refinement, clarity, diversity, depth of thought, and exuberance of emotion.

　　关于演员技术问题
    刘念渠
　　小引
    “为大众的动机与被大众欢迎的效果，是分不开的，必须使二者统一起来。”
    “我们的要求则是政治与艺术的统一，内容与形式的统一，革命的政治内容与尽可能高度的艺术形式的统一。缺乏艺术性的艺术品，无论政治上怎样进步，也是没有力量的。”
    当我们接受了这一教导之际，在演剧中，在为工农兵服务的演剧中，舞台艺术是不应该忽视的。这就是说，我们应该学习和研究怎样用高度的、优秀的舞台艺术来完满的、正确的表现革命的政治内容。在舞台艺术中，演员的演技正是重要的部分之一。前此的实验经验与理论，不为不丰，但是，似乎还少总结与发展。这里，根据近半年来看戏所得，将个人偶然想到的几个小题目，试行写出，借供大家讨论。错误与疏失的地方，尤盼得到严正指示！
　　一　演员的自我锻炼
    假定有这样的一个朋友，他曾经在某一戏剧学校里受过两三年的表演基本训练并且不少实习的机会，或者，他几年来一直参加着某一文工团队而得不时扮演着群众之一、不大重要的人物或偶然派到的主角，一般的说，他就是演员了，什或，可能被认为是很有希望的演员。在已有伟大成就的演员——表演艺术家之外，我们欢迎并需要这样的演员。在事实上，今天也正存在着大量的这样的演员。
    无须去问了，每一个这样的演员，都希望着自己在演技方面有日新月异的进步，真正的成为表演艺术家。这种希望是合理的、正确的、应该有而且必须有的。
    为了将有日新月异的进步，较多的舞台实践是非常必要的，演剧不能没有演员，演员不能没有舞台。但，我想在这里说的，乃是舞台以外的事情。
    舞台以外，连排演室内的工作也除开吧，剩下的就是生活与学习了。生活是集体的，是有规律的，同时，也是紧张与忙碌的，这都不会妨碍反而可以帮助演员的进步。学习是每一个人所该认真下工夫的事情，演员当然包括在内。在文工团队里，学习内容常是非常丰富的：思想学习、业务学习、政策学习，还有批评与自我批评。我们知道，绝大多数的演员不曾拒绝这种学习，而学习的成绩也显而易见。但，我想在这里说的，乃是上述生活与学习以外的事情。
    生活与学习以外，还能有什么呢？是的，应该没有什么了。我想说的，乃是在一般的或如上述的生活与学习之内而每每为演员们所忽略了的一件事情——自我炼锻，即，演员的工具（包括身体以及由身体派生的思想、感情、气质与创造的幻想的能力）的锻炼。
    自我锻炼，对于任何一个演员，包括了已有伟大成就的演员，也是一件头等重要的事情，又是必须经常进行的事情。将演员比做战士吧，身体等等就是战士的武器。有没有不经常注意、爱护、检查与擦洗自己的武器的战士呢？倘有，那一定是得被批评的战士。
    自我锻炼，不是个人脱离了集体的活动，在小组中进行可能收到更大的效果。如果暂时没有这种可能，独自一人也可以进行。依照演剧——演技的特定需要，身体以及思想、感情、气质与创造的幻想的能力，首先要求与这种特定需要完全适应。有着非常健康的、肌肉发达正常的身体，大可以在运动场上一显身手，却还不足移到舞台上来，后者要求经过适当的、专门的训练，并且，将这训练不断的继续下去。学习马列主义——毛泽东思想，对于演员，于将它与艺术结合起来之后，还得进一步的将它与演技结合起来，譬如怎样运用马克思主义辩证法的原则去认识、掌握与表现剧中人物，怎样把史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的表演体系批判的吸收——使之中国化，正是演员的课题。以次，如感情、气质与创造的幻想的能力，无不需要经常的锻炼。适应的标准，我想，应该是使工具完全可以自由运用，即，完全听从演员自己的支配与控制，得心应手。然后，还要求再进一步的去发展工具，即，使自由运用的广度与深度的逐渐加强。以一个普通的苏联共产党员与列宁相较，在舞台上创造这样两个人物，无疑的，后者向演员要求的更多也更苛。并不仅仅由于列宁是特别伟大的人物，主要的，由于演员必须表现他的崇高精神与深刻思想才算够格。
    在自我锻炼中，身体等等，不是可以分开来各别孤立的。重要的在于如何通过身体——神经与肌肉的活动，即所谓表情与动作，表现出为某一人物创造而用的、特定的思想、感情、气质与创造的幻想的能力，使观众得到明确的认识。这就是说，一定得习于：头脑里想什么和怎样想，借于物质的身体一一传达于外，单单“心里有数”或“自己明白”是不行的。这不是一朝一夕之功，一年两年可以有个基础，三年五年才能有显著的成绩，而且，应该演到老，锻炼到老。
　　二　认识人物与表现人物
    演员与他（或她）所扮演的某一人物的关系。有如结交朋友，可以一见如故，也可以开始不大投缘，都得靠相当时期的不断交往，特别是两颗心——两个灵魂的接触，才能成为生死不渝的知己。
    由于剧中人物并不是具体存在于现实生活中的朋友，演员有必要寻求一种较合理的方法去接触他或她，以期不走冤枉路，并求全面的与深刻的认识、把握与表现，完成创造人物这一任务。我想，能够在演技中运用马克思主义辩证法的道理，将大有助于这一工作的进行。
    演员读过七次剧本，又是欣赏的读，又是研究的读；又注意全剧，又注意自己所扮演的某一人物——譬如“北京人”的曾皓吧，然后在笔记本上详详细细写下了有关曾皓的一切，包括剧本所规定的和演员自己所想象与设计的，或者，给曾皓写下详细的传记或日记。也许这一切都保留在演员的思想中，一个字也不用写下。这，因人而异，都是可采用的手段。问题在于：如何认识（然后是把握与表现）这有关曾皓的一切呢？
    第一、应该从这一人物与产生这一人物的环境的内在联系，从这一人物与其他人物之间的联系、相互依赖、相互制约中去认识、去把握、去表现。譬如自私自利类似阿尔贡（莫利哀的“悭吝人”的主角），怀有伤逝情感有如莱内夫斯基夫人（柴霍甫的“樱桃园”的女主角），某些地方又有点象“红楼梦”里的贾母的曾皓，是没落了的封建社会中的人物，他的思想与情感，正密切的联系着往日的煊赫与光荣，也密切的联系着现今的衰败与贫困。他的自私，恰好是通过他与愫方等人的关系表现出来的，越有愫方的服从，越衬出曾皓的自私。这就是说，演员不能抓住了某一点性格的特征而把它孤立起来。开头考察这种联系之际，还应该对于本质的、必然的、深刻的、有机的联系与非本质的、偶然的、表面的、不重要的联系区别开来，紧握前者，滤去后者。又如，曾文清躲在自己屋子里吸鸦片这一事实，对曾皓说，就是本质的、必然的、深刻的、有机的联系。从这里，表现了曾皓的恨铁不成钢的心理与家庭不能复兴的失望。
    第二、应该从这一人物的运动与发展中去认识、去把握、去表现。在剧本里已经如此写着了，曾皓不是一出场就把他的全部性格表现出来的，而是随着剧情进展——他自己在这环境中的对人对事的行动、思想与感情的进展面逐渐表现出来的。他的伤逝的情感可能是多年潜存在心里的，只有他看到儿子如何不成材，家庭如何存在着纠纷以及即将完全没落之际，他才在儿女面前一吐为快。如果演员忽略了这一发展的线索，后来必定显得突兀。还有一个更明显的例子。犹疑不决是哈姆雷特（沙士比亚的“哈姆雷特”）的全部性格的基础，演员得认识这一点。但是，不能将它当做凝固了的性格去看待。这一性格，正经历着无数的变化、起伏、斗争——从来不曾停止过的运动与发展，奔向悲剧的顶点。人物的性格，就是在这种不断的运动和变化，不断的更新和发展的状态中显示出来的，并且，因运动与发展而呈现出多样的光彩。
    第三、应该从一个人物的行动、思想与情感的那种由小的、隐秘的量的变化到公开的、根本的质的变化中去认识，去把握，去表现。在观众心目中显得突如其来的行动、思想与感情上的变化，除去剧本根本写得那么突如其来之外，无一不有着这种由小的、隐秘的量的变化到公开的、根本的质的变化的过程。演员应该从字里行间去发掘它。在“北京人”里，我们曾看见曾皓发现曾文清仍旧藏在自己屋子里吸鸦片之后，他向自己的儿子跪下了，说：“你是父亲，我是儿子，我给你跪下……”曾文清丢下手里的鸦片烟枪跑出去了。曾皓的这一跪是非常重要的，它充分表现了他对儿子的爱与期望以及由爱与期望转成的急与恨。如果演员忽略了前此的一串变化过程，无论他演得多么“象”或自然、熟练、生动，终不免有突如其来之感，并且，不可避免的存在着虚饰的成分。打算避免虚饰，演员就得认真考虑前此的一串变化过程：从曾文清准备外出做事而手指残存着烟渍给与曾皓的印象并在他心里上引起的影响起，在他心目中的曾文清每一行动，都是造成小的、隐秘的量的变化的因素。而后，达到了这种情感上的变态：爱转为恨。没有特别标明这一条线，表演必将成为片断的与虚饰的。
    第四，应该从一个人物的内在矛盾与内部斗争中去认识、去把握、去表现。仍旧说曾皓吧。前面提过，他的自私，恰好是通过他与愫方等人的关系表现出来，越有愫方的服从，越衬出曾皓的自私。这里，还须加以进一步的分析。曾皓的自私，还表现在他自己的思想的矛盾上。他一方面用自以为是的理由劝阻愫方嫁人，要把她留到自己身边，直到他死；另方面，他深知这是不合理的与难于完全做到的事情，却话里话外，近于顽强的留住她。斗争在他的心里进行着，也就加强了表现出来的自私。不仅是曾皓，如愫方、如曾文清，也各有各的内在矛盾与内部斗争存在于自己的行动，思想与感情里，从而加强了表现出来的善良、懦弱、幻想、苟安以及被拘于这个“牢”里的大痛苦。哈姆雷特的性格，则更多依靠于他的内在矛盾与内部斗争。有名的“做呢还是不做呢”（Ｔｏ
　ｂｅ　ｏｒ　ｎｏｔ　ｏｔ　ｂｅ……）的独白表现了这个，当国王祈祷之际哈姆雷特想杀他又做罢的这一段戏也表现了这个。也就是这个迄未得解决的内在矛盾与内部斗争，构成了他的犹疑不决的性格基础，并且通过内在矛盾与内部斗争的流露而着重的表现出来。
    我得承认，这里所述说的方法，实际上正是我们的优秀的演员曾经自觉的或不自觉的用途的方法，顶多不过是未曾全部应用而已。我以为，对于任何一个人物，都有必要与可能从上举四点去认识、去把握、去表现，也许在比重上略有差别而已。
    认识、把握与表现，在创造人物的过程中，不是三个可以明显分开的阶段。这实际上乃是人物的行动、思想与感情——人物的性格及人物的行动的交互启发与交互渗透的作用的发展，或者说，是内容与形式统一的发展。有了一个最初的轮廓，有了一条由开始到结尾的线索，演员可以规定表现人物的种种细节了。细节，必须是特征的，而不是自然主义的繁琐。黄省三（“日出”）应该有点驼背吗？好，让他有点驼背吧。可是，演员一定得使观众明白：黄省三的驼背是长年伏案为了每月十二块八毛五劳作的结果，而不是由于其他原因招来的或天生成的。这差异是细微的，而演技的精采就体现在细微之处。
    从认识人物到在舞台上表现人物，是需要技术的，是需要一定形式的。单纯的向现实生活模仿不行，而是在现实生活中扎根并从现实生活出发的。面着多样而复杂的现实生活，演员需要认真而深入的学习与体验，也需要在学习与体验的收获这基础上，充分发挥想象与创造力，选择与提炼是必要的工夫。通过选择与提炼，以达到最有真实性、代表性的与典型性的，性格化的表现。
    这个样子的演技，我们称之为现实主义的演技。现实主义的演技，永远反对模仿，反对千篇一律，反对刻板化，反对差不多，反对矫柔造作，反对浮光掠影，而追求真实、精炼、明确、多彩、思想的深刻与感情的洋溢。
