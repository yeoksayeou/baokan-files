Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 27th: TASS, Moscow - The All-Soviet Peace Conference opened in Moscow on the 25th. At the first day's meeting, writer Tikhonov first delivered a report entitled "Defending Peace and the Struggle Against Provocateurs of a New War."

He said: We, the Soviet people, are convening the Peace Conference to further develop the cause of the people's movement in support of peace and against the warmongers. In the movement of millions of people in support of peace, the Soviet state plays a leading role. The great socialist motherland has always been and still is a strong bulwark of international security and a defender of peace, and the Soviet people are proud of this fact. The Soviet people are proud of the Soviet state's foreign policy and wholeheartedly cheer for this peaceful policy, which not only defends our interests but also defends the interests of all progressive mankind.

Tikhonov said: In every corner of the world, in every country, people are calling out a name in various languages with equal force, as a call for true friendship among nations, for lasting peace and international security. This name is familiar to everyone. This is our great leader, our dear father and friend, our Comrade Stalin! (Stormy applause)

Tikhonov pointed out: Due to the Soviet Union's firm and consistent peaceful foreign policy, the influence of the political activities of millions of ordinary people who responded to the call of the Paris World Peace Congress to rise up and defend peace, and the influence of the inevitable and increasingly imminent crisis, the British and American ruling blocs have been helplessly forced to make concessions on certain points in the German and Austrian issues.

For the sake of peace, the Soviet government remains true to the spirit and substance of the Potsdam resolutions jointly passed by the major powers, and remains true to the cause of international cooperation.

However, the tycoons in Washington and London have consistently failed to implement the resolutions passed at the Potsdam Conference and have obstructed international cooperation throughout the world, replacing it with a policy of command, the Marshall Plan, and the North Atlantic Treaty. Tikhonov said: The Soviet people once saved the nations from Hitler's aggression, saved world culture, and have enough strength to defend it from the threat of a new war.

Tikhonov said: We are against war. We do not want war anywhere, but we are not afraid of our enemies—the enemies of peace and humanity. We tell our friends around the world: Raise the banner of defending peace even higher! Let the phrase "Be brave, fight even more bravely for peace!" as stated in the declaration of the World Peace Congress, resound in every corner to answer the conspiracies of the warmongers.

　　苏联具有强大力量领导世界保卫和平
    全苏和平大会上作家吉洪诺夫报告
    【新华社北平二十七日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：全苏拥护和平大会于二十五日在莫斯科开幕。在第一日会上，作家吉洪诺夫首先作了题为“保卫和平与反对新战争挑拨者的斗争”的报告。
    他说：我们苏联人民召开拥护和平大会，是为了进一步发展拥护和平、反对战争贩子的人民运动的事业。在千百万人民拥护和平的运动中，苏维埃国家起着领导的作用。伟大的社会主义祖国始终是而且现在依然是国际安全的强大的据点与和平的保卫者，苏联人民都以这一事实而自豪。苏联人民为苏维埃国家的外交政策而骄傲，并全心全意地为这一和平政策而欢呼，这一政策不仅保卫着我们的利益，并且也保卫着全体进步人类的利益。
    吉洪诺夫说：在全世界的每一个角落，在每一个国家里，人们都在用各种不同的语言、以同等的力量呼唤着一个名字，作为争取各民族间的真正友谊，作为争取持久和平与国际安全的号召。这个名字是每一个人所熟悉的。这就是我们伟大的领袖、我们亲爱的父亲和朋友、我们的斯大林同志。（暴风雨般的鼓掌）
    吉洪诺夫指出：由于苏联坚定与一贯的和平外交政策，由于千百万响应巴黎世界和平大会的号召起而保卫和平的老百姓的政治活动的影响，由于不可避免的日益迫近的危机的影响，英美统治集团已无可奈何地被迫在德、奥问题的某些点上让步了。
    苏联政府为了和平的缘故，依然忠实于大国共同通过的波茨坦决议的精神与实质，依然忠实于国际合作的事业。
    但华盛顿和伦敦的大亨们却一直不执行波茨坦会议上所通过的决议，并阻挠着全世界的国际合作，以命令的政策、马歇尔计划和北大西洋公约取而代之。吉洪诺夫说：苏联人民曾经从希特勒的侵略下拯救了各个民族，拯救了世界文化，并且拥有足够的力量来保卫它免受新战争的威胁。
    吉洪诺夫说：我们反对战争。我们不希望任何地方有战争，但我们并不害怕我们的敌人——和平与人类的敌人。我们告诉全世界的朋友们：更高地举起保卫和平的旗帜！让世界和平大会宣言里所说的“勇敢，更勇敢地为和平而斗争！”这句话，响澈每一个角落，来回答战争贩子的阴谋。
