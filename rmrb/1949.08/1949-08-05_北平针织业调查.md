    Investigation of the Beiping Knitting Industry
    Xiao He
    The knitting industry in Beiping mainly focuses on sock weaving. Its development process over the past thirty years has been quite tortuous. The long-term reactionary rule of the Kuomintang has left behind problems in the knitting industry regarding quality, equipment, and sales, which are waiting to be resolved. After the liberation of Beiping, the industry flourished with the support of trade companies, but due to insufficient guidance, factories have engaged in blind production, resulting in product stagnation, which also urgently needs to be overcome.

    Repeated Blows from Japanese Invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's Bandits

    The knitting industry appeared in Beiping during the late Qing Dynasty, in the Xuantong era. Beiping established an apprentice school with a sock weaving department to teach sock weaving techniques. The first knitting factory was the Huaxing Company, founded in 1913.

    During the period after the September 18th Incident and before the July 7th Incident, the knitting industry developed to some extent. At that time, there were about a hundred knitting factories with five hundred sock weaving machines, producing 20,000 dozen pairs per month. Later, the Japanese invaders controlled cotton yarn, and knitting factories switched to other industries. From 1943 to 1945, only twenty-four remained. In the later stages of the war against Japan, due to the existence of a black market for cotton yarn, larger factories fell into despair, while small-scale family producers emerged.

    After the victory against Japan in 1945, the Beiping knitting industry saw a slight recovery, but it was quickly devastated by the Kuomintang's civil war policies, inflation, the severing of ties between urban and rural areas, and the invasion of foreign goods. Before liberation, according to statistics from the Beiping Knitting Industry Guild, there were only forty-eight knitting factories.

    Number of Factories Soars After Liberation

    After the liberation of Beiping in February this year, under the call to "transform the consumer city into a production city," with the support of cooperative bank loans and trade companies' procurement of goods and supply of raw materials, the knitting industry developed rapidly. Currently, 281 factories are registered with the Industry and Commerce Bureau, and there are still a large number of unregistered small-scale family factories, with as many as 1,000 trading with trade companies.

    According to a survey of the 281 knitting factories registered with the Industry and Commerce Bureau, 258 are sock factories; only two are yarn factories, but they have strong capital, modern equipment, and excellent finished products; nine are knitted underwear factories; and four are singlet factories, which purchase yarn for processing. Among them, seven factories use electric machines. In total, there are forty electric sock weaving machines, 892 hand-cranked sock weaving machines, and 139 sewing, overlock, and flat knitting machines. The monthly output is 50,000 dozen pairs of socks, 1,500 dozen singlets, 1,000 dozen knitted underwear sets, and 200 dozen gloves. The monthly demand is 5,000 bundles of 20-count yarn, 1,600 bundles of 32-count yarn, and 3,000 bolts of yarn. The total number of employees is 1,162.

    The characteristic of Beiping's knitting industry is its focus on sock weaving, with hand-cranked manual machines accounting for more than 90%, and most are family sideline businesses, resulting in irregular output and unfixed trademarks. Before liberation, major department stores in Beiping sold Shanghai socks. Whenever there was a shortage of socks of a certain size, color, or pattern, they would find local knitting factories to imitate them. Therefore, local knitting factories had close relationships with major department stores, with mutual dependence, forming a "supplementary" nature of the Beiping knitting industry to the Shanghai knitting industry.

    Some Manufacturers Produce Shoddy Goods

    These characteristics are caused by Beiping's industrial environment.

    Compared with Shanghai, the conditions of Beiping's knitting industry are far behind. In terms of production capacity, Shanghai produces 3 million dozen pairs of socks per month, while Beiping only produces 50,000 dozen pairs. In terms of equipment, Beiping is even more backward: the production process of Shanghai's knitting industry includes three departments: singeing, weaving, and finishing. Singeing involves treating raw yarn with caustic soda, sulfuric acid, and acetic acid to burn off impurities and fluff in the yarn, cleaning it with water, leaving pure cotton that is shiny, strong, does not pill, and does not fade. Weaving is mostly done with electric machines. In addition to knitting factories, there are also specialized finishing factories, whose work includes dyeing, steaming, pressure, and decoration. Only one knitting factory in Beiping has singeing equipment; most sock weaving is done with manual hand-cranked machines, and the quality is not as good as electric machines; and there are no finishing factories. Even the few knitting factories that have finishing departments only have three to five. In addition, Shanghai has many yarn mills that can adapt to factories and supply the yarn that factories need. The knitting industry in Beiping needs to adapt to the yarn mills; the knitting factories can only produce finished products based on what yarn the yarn mills produce, putting them in a completely passive position. Shanghai knitting factories generally use 42-count or 60-count plied yarn, making the finished products delicate and strong. Beiping mostly uses 32-count or 20-count yarn, so the products are inferior compared to Shanghai.

    Furthermore, due to the long-term destruction and trampling of the Beiping knitting industry under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and the Japanese invaders, many weaknesses exist. First, poor quality: Because local knitting products are inferior to Shanghai products, they take advantage of the low purchasing power of the general public and aim to win by selling cheaply. Manufacturers want to sell cheaply and make money, resulting in cutting corners. In Beiping, some retail stalls and wholesale markets often sell socks woven from 20-count or even 32-count single-strand yarn, only aiming for cheap and easy sales, regardless of whether buyers can wear them. For the seams, most factories use manual sewing or even sewing machine stitching to save money or because they lack equipment, which is extremely fragile. Some colored socks use inferior dyes, only aiming for temporary beauty, but they fade easily. Second, no fixed trademarks: Beiping sock factories do not have fixed trademarks; they use whatever brand sells well. Some small printing shops specialize in making various trademarks, even famous national brands like Wolfhound and Ink Chrysanthemum, for knitting factories to choose from. Many trademarks, or those printed on socks, have the words "Made in Shanghai" or "Made in America." This is a very bad phenomenon in the Beiping knitting industry. Third, adulteration and fraud: Trade companies purchase knitted goods based on weight and size, resulting in socks being found to be sprayed with water, containing salt in the sock tubes, or with insufficient size, forcibly stretched to the appropriate length, or with defects that are not repaired.

    Due to the above-mentioned shortcomings of the products of most small factories and family producers in the Beiping knitting industry, and due to the unplanned and blind production of many factories, the market has become stagnant, and profits have also decreased, which has hit the legitimate production of factories with experience, excellent technology, and larger scale. This is a serious problem in the entire Beiping knitting industry.

    Correct Blind Production, Actively Improve Quality

    If the Beiping knitting industry wants to develop, it must make great efforts to improve. First, correct the purely profit-oriented viewpoint. Understand that temporary and current interests are not long-term interests, and those who profit by deception have no future. Second, overcome the style of blind production, and strive to achieve production with investigation, research, planning, and purpose. There should be a clear grasp of what kind of finished products are needed in which market. Third, improve quality to achieve sturdiness, practicality, and beauty, which requires: (1) No longer weaving single-strand cotton socks, (2) Ribbed socks must use linking, abandon manual sewing, and especially do not use sewing machine stitching. Flat-mouth high-waisted socks must use grafting, and try to use machine sewing for the toes. (3) The scale of loosening and tightening large pieces must be scientific and not without standards. (4) Avoid using inferior dyes for socks. Fourth, carefully select machines. The number of new sock weaving households in the city is surging, but most are amateurs with no experience in the quality of sock weaving machines. Some sock machine factories are rushing to manufacture to meet this need, regardless of technical quality. And some commercial firms and brokers are massively hoarding sock weaving machines and selling them to amateurs to make profits. If the machines are bad, it is impossible to weave good finished products. Fifth, gradually improve and add electric machines in a step-by-step manner; family producers with only one or two manual hand-cranked machines can experiment with combining into production cooperatives. Singeing equipment and finishing departments should be valued, and finishing factories should be established when possible.

    The Beiping knitting industry has a history of more than 30 years. Factories such as Yizhong, Zhiye, and Wuxing have excellent technology, and their finished products were once popular in the Northeast, Northwest, and along the Pinghan Railway. If they can actively improve in the future, they can not only overcome the current difficulties of stagnation but also have a very good future.

    北平针织业调查
    孝鹤
    北平的针织业以织袜为主。三十多年来的发展过程是颇为曲折的。国民党长时期反动统治的结果，在针织业中遗留下来的质量、设备、销路等问题还等待解决。北平解放后，该业在贸易公司扶植下蓬勃发展，但由于指导性不够，各厂形成盲目生产的现象，造成产品滞销的结果，也急待努力克服。
    日寇蒋匪  两次打击
    针织业出现在北平是在清末宣统年间，北平开办艺徒学堂，设有织袜科，传授织袜技术。针织厂首创于一九一三年的华兴公司。
    九一八事变后至七七抗战前的一段时间，针织业一度发展，当时针织工厂约有百家，织袜机有五百台，月产量达二万打。以后日寇统制棉纱，针织厂纷纷转业，一九四三至四五年间，仅余二十四家。抗战后期，由于有棉纱黑市存在，较大工厂虽走进绝境，家庭小生产者却纷纷出现。
    一九四五年抗战胜利后，北平针织业曾稍见复苏，但转眼间即被国民党的内战政策，通货膨胀，城乡断绝，外货入侵……打击得一蹶不振。解放前，据北平针织业同业公会的统计，针织业工厂仅有四十八家。
    解放以后  厂数激增
    今年二月北平解放后，在“把消费城市变为生产城市”的号召下，经过合作银行贷款，贸易公司收货、供给原料的扶助方式，针织业迅速发展，目前向工商局登记的工厂有二百八十一家，尚有大批未登记的小型家庭工厂，其与贸易公司交易的即达一千家。
    根据在工商局登记的二百八十一家针织工厂的调查，织袜厂占二百五十八家；甬子纱厂仅有两家，但资本雄厚，设备近代化，成品优良；线衣裤工厂九家；汗衫背心工厂四家，系购买甬子纱，加工性质。其中用电力机器的工厂有七家。总计有电力织袜机四十台，手摇织袜机八百九十二台，缝纫、包缝、平机等共一百三十九台。月产袜子五万打，汗衫一千五百打，线衣一千打，手套二百打。月需二十支纱五千捆，三十二支纱一千六百捆，甬子纱三千匹。职工总计有一千一百六十二人。
    北平针织业的特点在于以织袜为主，手摇人力机占百分之九十以上，且大多为家庭副业性质，产量不正常，商标不固定。解放以前，北平各大百货公司售卖上海袜子，每遇某种尺码，某种颜色，某种花纹的袜子缺货时，就找本市针织工厂加以仿造，因此，本市针织厂与大百货公司关系密切，相互有依赖性，形成北平针织业对上海针织业的“补助”性质。
    部分厂商  粗制滥造
    这些特点是北平的工业环境造成的。
    与上海比较，北平针织业的条件相差甚远。就生产能力而言，上海每月产袜三百万打，北平仅五万打。就设备而言，北平更属落后：上海针织业的生产过程包括上瓦斯光、织、整理三个部门。上瓦斯光即将原纱经过火碱、硫酸、醋酸、烧去纱中的杂质及浮毛，用清水摆净，所剩纯棉、光泽、坚固、不起毛，不脱色。织则多为电力机。针织工厂以外，还有专门的整理工厂，其工作包括染、汽汀（熨）、汽压力，装璜等部门。北平仅一中针织厂有上瓦斯光的设备；织袜大部是手机人力机，质量不如电机；又没有整理工厂，各针织工厂有整理部门的也不过三、五家。此外，上海纱厂众多，纱厂能适应工厂，供给工厂所需要的纱。北平的针织业则需适应纱厂，纱厂出什么纱，针织厂才能出产什么成品，完全处于被动地位。上海各针织厂普遍采用四十二支或六十支合股线，成品细致坚固，北平多采用三十二支或二十支纱，故与上海相较，产品则差。
    又由于北平针织业长时期处于国民党反动统治下的摧残，日寇的蹂躏，本身存在很多的弱点。第一、质料粗劣：本市针织产品因为较上海产品为差，就利用一般人民购买力低，以贱卖取胜。厂商又要贱卖，又要赚钱，结果就流入偷工减料一途。北平若干零售摊及批发市场往往可以看到用二十支甚至三十二支单根线坯织成的袜子，只图价廉易销，不顾购者能否穿用。在缝口上，大多数工场为图省钱，或因无设备，就用人工缝，甚至用缝纫机扎，极不坚固。色袜的染料有的用品色，只图一时好看，但极易脱色。第二，无固定商标：北平织袜工厂均无固定商标，那一种牌子好卖就贴那一种商标，有的小印刷局专门做出各种各样的商标来甚至全国著名的狼狗牌，墨菊牌的商标也有，任各针织厂前往挑选。很多商标上，或者印在袜子上的，有“上海制”，“美国制”的字样。这实在是北平针织业的一种很不好的现象。第三，搀假舞弊：贸易公司收购针织品以重量、尺寸为标准，结果在收进的袜子中，有的发现喷了水，有的袜筒里放了食盐，有的尺寸不够，硬拉到相当的长度，有的织坏了也不加修理。
    由于北平针织业中多数小工厂及家庭生产者的产品有以上的缺点，也由于众多工厂无计划的盲目生产，结果使市场滞销，利润也随之减低，有资历，技术优良，规模较大工厂的正当生产因此受到打击，这是全北平市针织业存在的一个严重问题。
    纠正盲目生产  积极改良品质
    平市针织业欲求发展，非加大力改进不可，第一、纠正单纯利润观点。须知暂时的目前的利益不是长远的利益，仰仗欺骗而获利的人，今后是没有前途的。第二、克服盲目生产的作风，要做到有调查，有研究，有计划，有目的的生产。对于那一个市场需要那一种成品，应该有明确的把握。第三、提高质量，做到坚固、适用及美观的水准，须要：（一）不再织单根线棉袜，（二）罗口袜一定要采用套口，放弃人工缝口，尤其不要用缝纫机扎口的作法。平口高腰袜一定要采用挂口，缝尖也尽量改用机器缝。（三）大件放松放紧的尺度一定要科学化，不能漫无标准。（四）避免用品色染袜。第四，要慎重选择机器。本市新起的织袜户风起云涌，但多数为外行，对于织袜机的好坏，根本没有经验，若干袜机工厂为适应这项需要，就赶快制造，不问技术优劣。而若干商行及经纪人就大量扒吸织袜机，卖给外行，从中赚取利润。机器不好，就不可能织出好的成品。第五，有步骤地渐次改进，增添电力机；仅有一二部人力手摇机的家庭生产者，可以试验结合成为生产合作社。上电光设备和整理部门应予重视，可能时应建立整理工厂。
    北平针织业已有三十多年的历史，一中、织业、芜兴等厂，技术均极优良，成品也曾畅销东北、西北及平汉沿线。今后如能积极改进，不仅可以克服目前滞销的困难，而且有着极好的前途。
