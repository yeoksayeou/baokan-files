Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 28th: Shandong Province's military industrial production will largely shift to civilian production in the second half of this year. A portion will be further improved to carry out regularized national defense industrial production and construction. The Shandong Provincial Finance and Economics Office's Industry and Mining Department convened a meeting in July, gathering responsible personnel from Shandong's military industries, mines, and other heavy industrial enterprises to discuss the aforementioned transition. The meeting decided that the military industrial production being converted would mainly shift to mining and other enterprises, manufacturing water pumps, winches, and other equipment needed for mining. Simultaneously, some effort would be put into manufacturing steam engines for inland river vessels, chemical tools, and some agricultural implements. The meeting stipulated that the military industrial production units undergoing conversion in various regions should begin preparations for the transition starting in August. A responsible attitude should be adopted towards the handling of employees. In principle, converted employees should maintain their original wages. During the conversion, employees should be transferred to mining or other heavy industries based on their skills and work needs. Some may be sent to schools for advanced studies. For a small number of elderly and weak employees, they may return to their hometowns to participate in other production on a voluntary basis. In addition, the meeting held detailed discussions on issues such as employee wages, labor insurance, the adjustment of machinery and technical personnel after the conversion, the adjustment of organizational structures, and production plans for the second half of the year and next year.

    【新华社济南二十八日电】山东省的军事工业生产本年下半年将大部转入和平生产，一部分则继续提高一步，进行正规化的国防工业的生产建设。山东省财经办事处工矿部曾于七月间召集山东军工、矿山及其他重工业企业单位负责人员举行会议，就上述转变问题进行了讨论。会议中决定部分转业的军工生产主要是转入矿山及其他企业，制造矿山需要的水泵、绞车等，同时以一部分力量制造内河轮船用的蒸汽引擎、化学工具及部分农具等。会议规定各地转业的军工生产单位从八月份开始，即应进行转业的各项准备。对于员工的处理亦应采取负责态度。转业员工原则上保持原有工资；转业时应依据员工技能及工作需要等，分别转入矿山或其他重工业，有的则可送学校深造。对于少数老弱员工，可在其自愿原则下复员回乡参加其他生产。此外会议对员工工资、劳动保险、转业后机器与技术人员的调整、组织机构的调整以及下半年及明年的生产计划等问题，亦进行了详细讨论。
