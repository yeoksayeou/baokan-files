League Membership Card
By Nuowobo Liangsiqi
Translated by Fan Yinan

On July 6th, the league membership card was issued to Xieerjie. Mihaiyeleweiqi. Shalinikofu, a young miner from the “Mazhulefufu Qiji” mine. A festive atmosphere filled the simple room of the district committee. The bright red flag of the Communist Youth League's mining area organization was placed in the most prominent spot. Shalinikofu was wearing a brand-new miner's uniform, which he only wore on the most solemn festivals.

“Congratulations, Xieerjie!” said the secretary of the district committee. “You are now a member of the Communist Youth League! You should remember this and be proud of it. A member of the Communist Youth League is the first assistant of the Bolshevik Party and its reliable reserve force. From today on, you should prove your lofty reputation with your labor, your learning, and every action you take.”

“I will!” Xieerjie answered decisively, receiving the brand-new league membership card number "28374826" from the secretary of the district committee.

Xieerjie wanted to share his joy with his fellow miners as soon as possible. He sent a telegram to his sister, who was far away in Igarka in the Arctic, and ran to his friends, Bote Niewudaken and Shaxia Kalinski, to show them the glorious little booklet with the image of Lenin on the copper-green cover—the league membership card.

Shalinikofu hurried to the mine. He decided to prove today that he didn't get the league membership card for nothing.

A year ago, Xieerjie worked as a tunneling worker. Later, he was assigned to the blasting squad. There, Shalinikofu received extremely important mine technology training—as a blaster. He skillfully and bravely installed the fuses and turned on the electricity. Then, a series of deafening underground explosions rang out, and tons of coal were cut from the lava.

Once, a coal truck got stuck in a certain section, and Shalinikofu managed to free it by helping. Another time, Xieerjie helped his partners build mine pillars in the various coal mining sections… In the mine, mutual help is necessary. Therefore, here, the characteristics of young miners are formed in labor, and their enthusiastic interest in public affairs also increases.

When the Communist Youth League started the "Struggle for Saving" campaign, Shalinikofu was assigned to work as a supervisor. Xieerjie supervised his fourth section to prevent electricity from being wasted. For example, when the pitmen stop drilling and give the place to the coal miners—at this time, the engine can be turned off. This is what Shalinikofu did. If the explosives are buried deeper and sealed more firmly, then the explosion will be more powerful, and one bomb can be used as two. Xieerjie proved this in practice. In order to save explosives, Shalinikofu came up with a more reasonable way to assemble the fuses…

Shalinikofu had thought about joining the Communist Youth League for a long time. But in April and May, his team failed to complete the plan for several days, so Xieerjie decided: he must first improve the work in the team before joining the organization. Gradually, he and his fellow miners began to produce 30 to 35 tons of coal per shift, instead of the original planned 24 tons. By the end of June, Shalinikofu's team could produce 40 tons of coal per shift—completing 170% of the plan. That day, Xieerjie was almost overwhelmed… running from this place to that place, from this tunnel to that tunnel. And after leaving the mine at night, Xieerjie went to the league committee and submitted his application to join the Lenin-Stalin Communist Youth League…

To be a member of the Communist Youth League is the sincere wish of every young miner, and now this wish has been realized. To fully demonstrate his joining the organization, Xieerjie increased the planned output of 24 tons of coal per shift to 51 tons in the team where he worked. At the same time, they also saved 176 kilograms of explosives.

On the day Xieerjie. Shalinikofu received his league membership card, miners Vasili. Kelihuoxin, tunnel worker Weikeduo. Maergen, female driver Daqiyana. Zhuomukewenko, and electric locomotive mechanic Fuladimi. Xielujin also submitted applications to the "Mazhulefuvski" mining area branch to join the league… Excellent young miners are willing to become members of the Communist Youth League. The harmonious family of the Communist Youth League, with its millions of members, is growing and strengthening day by day, and becoming younger day by day.

    团证

    七月六日，团证发给“马诸乐夫期基”矿底青年矿工——谢尔杰·米海耶乐维契·沙里尼科夫。在区委朴素的房间里感到一种节日底气氛。共青团矿区组织底鲜红旗子安插在最耀眼的地方。沙里尼科夫穿着崭新的矿工服，这身衣服只有在最庄严的节日他才穿上的。
    “恭贺你，谢尔杰！”区委书记说，“你现在是个共青团员啦！你应该牢记这个，并应以此自豪。共青团员——是布尔塞维克党底第一个助手，是他可靠的后备军。从今天起，每天你应该用劳动，用学习，用自己的每一件行动来证明崇高的信誉。”
    “我一定！”谢尔杰斩钉截铁地回答，从区委书记手中接过来崭新的第“二八三七四八二六”号团证。
    谢尔杰想尽快地与矿友共分快乐，给他远在北极伊喀尔克的姐姐拍了一个电报，又跑到他的朋友——波特·涅夫达肯和沙夏·卡林斯基那里，让他们看看外皮上带着列宁侧面像的，铜青色的光荣的小册子——团证。
    沙里尼科夫匆忙赶到矿上。他决定今天就证明：他不是白拿了团证的。
    一年以前谢尔杰曾做过通道工。以后又把他派到爆炸班。在那里，沙里尼科夫受到极重要的矿坑技术——爆破手底训练。他熟练而勇敢地装上药捻，通上电流。于是，震耳的地下爆炸声一连串地传来，成吨的煤在熔岩里被切裂下来了。
    有一次一辆载煤汽车在某地段卡住了，沙里尼科夫曾设法抽工帮了忙。另一次谢尔杰曾帮助伙伴们在各掘煤段分搭矿柱……在矿坑里，相互帮助是必要的。因此，在这里，青年矿工底特性在劳动中形成着，他对公共事业热烈的兴味亦增长了。
    当共青团员开始了“为节约而斗争”的运动时，沙里尼科夫被派到监督哨工作。谢尔杰在他的第四段内监督着，不使电力白白浪费。比如，坑夫停止钻孔，把地方让给掘煤工时，——这时候就可以关上发动机。沙里尼科夫就是这样做的。假若把炸药埋得更深，封埋得更结实的话，那么爆炸会来得更厉害，而且，一个炸弹可以顶两个用。谢尔杰在实际中证明了这点。为了节省炸药，沙里尼科夫便又想法更合理地装配药捻……
    沙里尼科夫早就想到过共青团。但在四、五月间他那一班有好几天都不能完成计划，于是谢尔杰就决定：一定要先改善了班里底工作，再加入组织。渐渐地，他和自己的矿友们开始每一轮班出煤三十吨到三十五吨，代替原计划的二十四吨到六月底，沙里尼科夫班每一轮班可出煤四十吨——完成计划的百分之百七十。那天谢尔杰几乎忙得不可开交…从这个地方跑到那个地方，从这个坑道跑到那个坑道。而晚上出了矿坑之后，谢尔杰便又到团委会里，递上了请求接受入列宁——斯大林共青团底申请书。……
    作一个共青团员，是每一个青年矿工衷心的愿望，而今这愿望已经实现了。为了十足地表现自己的加入组织，谢尔杰在他所工作的那个班里，把每一轮班应出煤二十四吨的计划，增加到出煤五十一吨。同时，他们还节约了一百七十六公斤的炸药。

    当谢尔杰·沙里尼科夫收到团证的那一天，向“马诸乐夫斯基”矿区支部提出入团申请的还有矿工瓦西里·克里活新，通道工维克多·马尔庚，女司机手达其雅娜·卓姆科文科，电气机车机械士弗拉地米尔·谢留金……优秀的青年矿工们都愿意成为共青团员。和睦的，百万成员的共青团底大家庭，就这样一天天在成长，强壮起来，一天天年轻起来。
