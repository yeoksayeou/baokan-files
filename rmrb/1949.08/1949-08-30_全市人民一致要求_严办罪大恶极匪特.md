　　The Entire City Unanimously Demands:
  　Severely Punish the Heinous and Wicked Bandits and Special Agents
    [From Our Newspaper] More than half a year since the liberation of Beiping, lurking bandits and special agents have continuously engaged in conspiracies to sabotage the revolutionary order and the lives and property of the people in the capital of the Chinese people, arousing public outrage throughout the city, and unanimously demanding that the People's Government severely punish the culprits. At the beginning of the liberation of Beiping, a huge Kuomintang military conspiracy and riot case was uncovered, and the principal offender, Zhang Yinwu, was arrested. The American imperialist spy, Xiong Xianli, used the identity of the Kuomintang Military Mediation Department, carrying weapons and a radio station, to spy on our military situation and provide intelligence to the American imperialists. After the liberation of Beiping, Wu Lei, a special agent of the Military Statistics Bureau, colluded with special agents Liu Chao Fan, Jiang Ming, etc., and misappropriated the name of the "Democratic Progress Association," and used the feudal Taoist sect, the Universal Relief Society, in an attempt to incite a military conspiracy and riot. Wang Ruoyu (former head of the Kuomintang Zhixing Society), a special agent of the Military Statistics Bureau, stated in a report to the special agent leader Chen Liren before the liberation that he had sent bandits and special agents from the "Incomparable Team" to infiltrate our "rear area for long-term lurking activities." After the liberation of Beiping, Wang Ruoyu attempted to impersonate a democratic party and continue to carry out sabotage, organizing a special agent organization called the "China New Socialist Revolution Party." Special agents also poisoned and killed people: Li Du and three other residents of Erdao Street and Balizhuang outside Chaoyangmen were poisoned to death, and more than fifty children at Xiangshan Orphanage were poisoned. They colluded with and organized disbanded soldiers and vagrants to commit robbery and disrupt the revolutionary order. When special agent Wang Junming and others robbed the Tianruixiang antique shop on Langfang Er Tiao outside Qianmen, they shot and killed shop assistant Guo Shouzhit; special agents Ye Zhimao and Li Junbo used torture and branding irons on victims in each of the seven robbery cases. According to incomplete statistics from the Public Security Bureau over the past six months, twelve victims died from injuries in robberies, more than forty were seriously injured, and large amounts of property were stolen. The bandits also planned to sabotage production and construction: the burning of fifty-nine trolleybuses of the trolley company is the most prominent example. The special agent organization "Confidential Bureau Special Economic Group" specialized in manufacturing fake People's Banknotes, and set up distribution points along the four railway lines of PingSui, PingHan, JinPu, and PingJin to undermine the people's financial market. They also carried out shameless assassinations, resulting in the sacrifice of three revolutionary cadres. Special agents Cheng Zhuqing, Xin Wei, and others forged the official seals and documents of the People's Government's "Secret Investigation General Group" and other organizations, organized reactionary armed forces, extorted money from the people, and undermined the relationship between the People's Government and the masses.
    In order to maintain revolutionary order, the Public Security Bureau of the People's Government has successively uncovered more than 14,000 cases of various types (including 83 military conspiracy cases), effectively suppressing the activities of the Chiang Kai-shek/American bandits and special agents, so that the revolutionary order in Beiping has become increasingly consolidated and production has gradually recovered. It has also twice called on reactionary party and league members and special agents to surrender and register, giving them a path to rehabilitation; and has handled special agents who sincerely repented with a spirit of leniency. However, some special agents have remained incorrigible, instead taking the lenient policy as an opportunity to take advantage, engaging in concealment while falsely surrendering and confessing, and continuing their sabotage activities. Some reactionary party, league, special agent bandits have resisted registration, even smashing registration offices and injuring workers (as done by Li Shengpu, a bandit of the MinShe Party). Recently, Wang Fengwu, the younger brother of Wang Fenggang, a special agent arrested by the Third Division of our Public Security Bureau, even carried out robberies with a gun. These facts show that the reactionaries are determined not to give up their persecution of the people, and they will try every possible means to continue to carry out conspiracies and harmful activities against the people.
    At the Beiping Municipal People's Representatives Conference, representatives called on the government to severely punish the bandits and culprits who endanger the lives and property of the people. At the Anti-Special Agent Public Security Exhibition, dozens of thick books of opinions were filled with the people's demands, and some criticized the government for being too lenient with special agents. One person, Cai Chusheng, said: The crimes of the reactionaries' special agents are a sign of human shame. In today's world where the people are in charge, we must completely and thoroughly eliminate them. Fu Zongshun said: I hope the government will not be too lenient with inhuman special agents. Many students particularly hate Xu Huidong, the special agent who single-handedly created the "July 5th" massacre, and suggest that the People's Government promptly punish this base and cruel executioner. Some volunteered and said: I must assist the government in eliminating all the evil bandits and special agents without leaving a single one.

　　全市人民一致要求
  　严办罪大恶极匪特
    【本报讯】北平解放半年多来，潜伏匪特对中国人民首都的革命秩序与人民的生命财产不断进行阴谋破坏，激起全市人民的公愤，一致要求人民政府严惩祸首。北平解放之初，即破获国民党巨大军事阴谋暴动案，主犯张荫梧等就捕。美帝间谍熊先立，则以国民党军调部的身份，带有武器与电台，刺探我方军情，供给美帝情报。军统特务吴雷远在北平解放后，与特务分子刘超凡、姜明等，盗用“民主促进会”名义，利用封建道门普济会，企图煽动军事阴谋暴动。军统特务分子王若愚（原国民党知行社负责人），在解放前给特务头子陈立仁的报告书中谓曾派匪特“绝世队”潜入我“后方进行长期的潜伏活动”。北平解放后，王若愚企图假冒民主党派，继续进行破坏，组织所谓“中国新社会革命党”的特务组织。特务分子并放毒杀害人民：朝阳门外二道街和八里庄的居民李杜氏等四名被毒死，香山慈幼院五十多个儿童中毒。他们勾结与组织散兵游勇行凶抢劫，破坏革命秩序；特务分子王俊明等在抢劫前门外廊房二条天瑞祥古玩铺时，曾开枪打死铺伙郭守志；特务分子叶志茂、李俊波在七次抢案中，每次都非刑拷打事主，并用火筷子烙烫事主。半年来据公安局不完全统计，抢案中事主们因伤致死者十二人，重伤四十余人，抢去大批财物。匪徒们并有计划的破坏生产建设：电车公司五十九辆电车的被烧毁，就是最显著的例证。匪特组织“保密局特种经济组”则专门制造假人民券，在沿平绥、平汉、津浦、平津四铁路线设立分销处，破坏人民的金融市场。他们又进行无耻的暗杀，使三个革命干部因而牺牲。特务分子程祝青、辛维等分别假造人民政府“密查总组”等关防印信及证件，组织反动武装，向人民敲诈勒索，并破坏人民政府与群众关系。
    人民政府公安局为维护革命秩序，曾先后破获各种案件一万四千余起（其中包括军事阴谋案八十三起），有力的镇压了蒋美匪特的活动，使北平革命秩序得以日趋巩固，生产逐步恢复。并曾先后两次号召反动党团人员和特务分子自首登记，给以自新之路；对诚意悔过之特务分子，一本宽大精神处理。但有一部分特务分子怙恶不悛，反以宽大政策为可乘之机，一面假自首，假坦白，一面则进行隐蔽，继续其破坏活动。有的反动党团特务匪徒，则抗拒登记，甚至捣毁登记室，殴伤工作员（如民社党匪徒李盛朴之所为）。最近为我公安内三分局逮捕的特务分子王凤岗之弟王凤武并曾带枪行抢。这些事实，说明反动派决不愿意放弃他们对人民的残害，他们要千方百计的继续向人民进行阴谋危害活动。
    北平市各界代表会议上，代表们纷纷要求政府严惩危害人民生命财产的匪徒祸首。反特治安展览会上，数十本厚厚的意见册写满人民的此种要求，有的并批评政府对特务分子太宽大了。一个署名蔡楚生的说：反动派的特务罪行，是人类耻辱的记号，在人民当家的今天，我们必须全部彻底干净的消灭他。傅宗舜说：希望政府不要对没有人性的特务太宽大。很多学生对一手制造“七五”血案的特务分子许惠东特别痛恨，建议人民政府迅速惩办这个卑污残忍的刽子手。有的则自报奋勇的说：我一定要协助政府把万恶的匪特一个不留的肃清。
