    With Organization and Preparation
    Second Yellow River Flood
    Successfully Surmounted
    [Special Dispatch from the Yellow River] The second Yellow River flood has been successfully surmounted thanks to the united efforts of the Party, government, army, and people in the former Hebei-Shandong-Henan area. Some sections of dangerous works experienced risks, but water levels in most areas have now receded. The main reasons for this victory are: (1) Relatively full preparations were made in advance, so when the flood arrived, orderly emergency protection could be carried out. (2) Leaders at all levels generally attached great importance to flood prevention work ideologically. Unity was achieved in leadership and consistency in action, and timely information liaison was maintained. (3) The old ideas of each caring only for themselves were broken down in the minds of the engineering team workers. When one place was in danger, engineering teams from other places immediately provided reinforcements, concentrating their efforts on emergency protection.

    黄河二次大水
    胜利渡过
    【本报黄河专电】黄河二次大水，在原冀鲁豫区党政军民一致奋斗下，业已胜利渡过。曾有几处险工出险，现在各地水位多已回落。所以能战胜的主要原因是：（一）事先有较充分的准备，因而当大水到来时，能进行有秩序的抢护。（二）各级领导一般的在思想上都很重视防汛工作。领导上取得了统一和行动上的一致，并保持及时的情报连系。（三）在工程队员工的思想上，打破了旧时的各不相顾的旧观点，作到了一处出险，别处工程队立即增援，集中大力，进行抢护。
