　　The people of other peace-loving countries around the world are adopting various forms of struggle to further promote the movement to defend peace. France has organized peace brigades, Britain and Australia have held mass meetings friendly to the Soviet Union, and the people of the four Nordic countries of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland have decided to hold "World Peace Consolidation Movement Weeks" successively in September and October. The Executive Committee of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress has recently designated October 2nd as the International Day of Struggle for Peace and called for the organization of demonstrations to defend peace in early September. The movement to defend world peace is also unfolding within the United States. The All-American Labor Union Defense of Peace Conference will be held on October 1st. The Preparatory Committee of the All-American Labor Union Defense of Peace Conference has issued a declaration, demanding that the Senate reject the so-called military foreign aid plan and strive for a peaceful resolution of disputes between the Soviet Union and the United States. In addition, the World Youth and Student Festival, which is currently in full swing, has held various friendship competitions, gatherings, and other fellowship programs, which have more closely united the youth of various countries in the struggle for peace. This grand gathering of world youth's great unity has won the active support and endorsement of the vast democratic youth of the world. The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League has issued a "Decision on Celebrating the Second Congress of the World Democratic Youth, the World Youth and Student Festival, and Commemorating International Youth Day," instructing youth league committees at all levels to carry out universal and in-depth internationalist propaganda and education among youth inside and outside the League, and to publish commemorative special issues and various gatherings to celebrate. More than 20,000 young people in Ping City held a grand gathering on the 28th to celebrate World Youth Day.
