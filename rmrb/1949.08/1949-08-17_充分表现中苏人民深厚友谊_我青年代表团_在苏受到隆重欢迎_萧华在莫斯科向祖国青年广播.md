　　Fully Demonstrating the Profound Friendship Between the Chinese and Soviet Peoples
    Our Youth Delegation
  　Receives a Grand Welcome in the Soviet Union
　  Xiao Hua Broadcasts to the Youth of the Motherland from Moscow
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 16th] Late News: Xiao Hua, the Acting Head of the Chinese Democratic Youth Delegation attending the World Youth Festival, addressed the youth of China on the 6th at the invitation of the All-Soviet Radio Station. In his broadcast, Xiao Hua described the grand welcome and reception the Chinese Democratic Youth Delegation received during its seven-day journey through the Soviet Union. The broadcast stated:
    Young friends throughout China: I represent the Democratic Youth Delegation attending the World Youth Festival to report to you in the motherland about our journey along the way.
    We departed from Beiping on the afternoon of July 22nd. At 5:00 PM on the 28th, we left our motherland and entered the borders of the great socialist Soviet Union. When our train arrived at Otpor Station, representatives from the Anti-Fascist Central Committee of Soviet Youth were sent to greet us, and they prepared a sumptuous dinner and a movie for us. When our special train passed through Siberia, countless Soviet people waved to us along the way, fully demonstrating the feelings of Sino-Soviet friendship. Siberia used to be a vast and desolate place, but now it is full of emerging industrial cities and large collective farms. At 4:00 PM on August 5th, we arrived in Moscow. The Moscow station was crowded with welcoming people, including representatives from the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Youth League and the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee, young Stakhanovite workers from various factories, and representatives of young students from various schools. They carried many bright red flags and gave us bouquets of flowers. We shouted slogans such as "Long live the unity of the Chinese and Soviet youth!", "Long live Stalin!", and "Long live Mao Zedong!" We shook hands and exchanged greetings cordially. Moscow, which the Chinese youth have long admired, we have finally seen with our own eyes. The delegation spent the entire day today visiting Moscow. Here, the scars of war are no longer visible. The people of Moscow are filled with free and joyful songs everywhere, and the streets and alleys are praising the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
    What we have seen in just a few days of travel in the Soviet Union has taught our delegation a lesson. We have a deeper understanding that the great Soviet Union and Moscow are the direction of mankind and the bastion of peace and democracy. The heroic spirit of the Soviet youth in the battles to defend the motherland, the great spirit of construction in implementing the Five-Year Economic Plan after the war, and the spirit of research and creation in new science and technology are all worthy of our Chinese youth to learn from. The youth of socialist countries are the model for our Chinese youth and our closest brothers.

　　充分表现中苏人民深厚友谊
    我青年代表团
  　在苏受到隆重欢迎
　  萧华在莫斯科向祖国青年广播
    【新华社布拉格十六日电】迟到消息：出席世界青年节的中国民主青年代表团代团长萧华，六日在莫斯科应全苏广播电台之邀向中国青年致词。萧华在广播中叙述了中国民主青年代表团在苏联境内七日旅途中所受到的隆重欢迎与招待。广播词称：
    全中国的青年朋友们：我代表出席世界青年节的民主青年代表团向在祖国的你们报告沿途经过。
    我们于七月二十二日下午从北平出发，二十八日下午五时，就离开祖国进入伟大的社会主义苏联的国境。当我们车抵奥特保尔车站时，苏联青年反法西斯中央委员会便派了代表来迎接我们，为我们准备好了丰美的晚餐和电影。我们的专车经过西伯利亚时，沿途各站也有无数苏联人民向我们招手，充分表现了中苏友谊的情感。西伯利亚原是一片广漠荒凉的地方，现在到处都是新兴的工业城市与广大的集体农场。八月五日下午四时到达莫斯科，莫斯科车站上拥挤着欢迎的人群，其中有苏联共产主义青年团中央和苏联青年反法西斯委员会的代表，有各工厂的青年斯达哈诺夫工作者，有各学校的青年学生代表。他们打着许多鲜红的旗帜，并送给我们一束又一束的鲜花。我们互相高呼着中苏两国青年团结万岁、斯大林万岁、毛泽东万岁的口号；相互亲切地握手慰问。中国青年久已景仰的莫斯科，现在我们终于亲眼看到了。代表团今天整天参观了莫斯科。在这里已经看不到战时的创伤。莫斯科的人们到处洋溢着自由愉快的歌声，街头巷尾都在赞颂中国人民解放军的伟大胜利。
    仅仅在苏联几天旅程中所见到的，便给我们代表团上了一课。我们更深切地体会到：伟大的苏联和莫斯科正是人类的方向与和平民主的堡垒。苏联青年在保卫祖国战斗中的英勇精神，在战后实行五年经济计划中的伟大建设精神，在新的科学技术方面的钻研创造的精神，都是值得我们中国青年学习的。社会主义国家的青年是我们中国青年的榜样，是我们中国青年最亲密的兄弟。
