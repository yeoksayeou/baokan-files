    Northeast State-Owned Coal Mine Bureau Chiefs' Conference
    Reviewing Neglect of Economic Accounting
    Establishing Methods to Reduce Costs
    [This newspaper reported] Northeast state-owned coal mines have focused on reviewing the serious phenomenon of neglecting economic accounting and the waste of materials in various aspects. The review was conducted at a joint conference of bureau chiefs from various state-owned mining bureaus convened by the Northeast Coal Mine Administration Bureau in late June. The system of enterprise-based economic accounting was emphasized as early as 1947 by the Northeast Finance and Economics Committee, and was adopted as an important resolution at the Sixth National Labor Congress in 1948. However, cadres in the coal mine system have not given it sufficient importance in their thinking. The supply mentality is quite prevalent, and they do not understand the importance of economic accounting, precise cost calculation, and the planned use of labor and materials in production management. Some cadres only pay attention to production and labor movements, treating economic accounting as a technical detail, claiming that they "handle affairs based on Party spirit and guarantee no corruption!" As a result, economic accounting in various mines is still very imprecise, and various statistics such as personnel and unit prices are often inconsistent. They are also very careless about budgets and final accounts, with many mines failing to submit the final accounts for March or even December of last year to the Mine Administration Bureau by June. Regarding the issue of cost calculation, it is quite common to only ask about the amount of production, regardless of the cost. For example, the Ministry of Industry stipulates that the cost per ton of coal should be 435,000 Northeast currency, while at the Saima Coal Mine, wages alone reach 540,000 per ton. Many mines only include wages and major equipment in cost calculations, and many small items are not included, making the calculations very imprecise and difficult to understand the profit and loss of production. At the same time, the waste of materials is also very serious in many mines. For example, at the Fushun Mining Bureau, the planning department and the management department are disconnected in production management. The planning department plans independently, and the management department spends blindly. Some construction projects are carried out carelessly, resulting in significant waste. Due to the carelessness of economic accounting and the waste of materials, summarizing the coal production of Northeast state-owned coal mines from January to May, although it exceeded the original plan by 14 percent, the production efficiency only reached 85 percent of the original plan (the original plan was for all state-owned coal mine personnel to produce an average of 0.33 tons of coal per person per day, but the average productivity per person from January to April was only 0.28 tons), wasting approximately 1.9 million man-days, thereby increasing the cost of coal. After reviewing the above issues, in order to achieve further improvement, various suggestions and improvement methods have been formulated for management work, economic accounting, cost reduction, and waste elimination, according to the instructions of Comrade Lü Dong, Deputy Minister of the Northeast Ministry of Industry.

    东北国营煤矿局长会议
    检讨忽视经济核算
    订定办法降低成本
    【本报讯】东北各国营煤矿曾着重检讨了忽视经济核算与各方面浪费资材的严重现象。检讨是在东北煤矿管理局于六月下旬所召开的各国营矿务局局长联席会议中进行的。生产企业化的经济核算制，在东北早于一九四七年之财经委员会上即已着重提出，并在一九四八年全国第六次劳动代表大会中作为重要决议；但煤矿系统干部在思想上对此直未予以足够重视，相当普遍地存在着供给思想，不了解经济核算，精确计算成本与有计划地使用劳力、资材等，在生产经营管理中的重要性；有些干部只注意生产、工运，把经济核算当成技术细节，自认为是“凭党性办事，保证不贪污！”因之各矿经济核算还很不精确，人员、单价等各种统计数字互相多不一致，对于预决算亦甚为马虎，不少矿至六月尚未向矿管局送交三月份甚或去年十二月份的决算；对于成本计算问题，相当普遍的是只问产量多少，不计成本高低，如工业部规定每吨煤成本为东北币四十三万五千元，而赛马煤矿仅工资一项每吨即达五十四万元。不少矿对成本计算只包括工资及主要器材，很多零碎器材均未计算在内，因之计算甚不精确，难以了解生产之盈亏。同时，在不少矿内对材料的浪费亦甚为严重，如抚顺矿务局在生产管理上计划处与经理处脱节，计划处单独计划，经理处盲目开支；有的对修建工程草率从事，造成极大的浪费。由于经济核算的马虎及资材使用的浪费，总结东北各国营煤矿一至五月份的煤产量虽超过原定计划的百分之十四，但在生产效率上则仅达原计划的百分之八十五（原计划国营煤矿全部人员平均每人每天产煤量为○·三三吨，但一月至四月的每人平均生产率仅达○·二八吨），浪费人力约一百九十多万个，从而提高了煤的成本。对上述问题经检讨后，为求得进一步改进，已根据东北工业部副部长吕东同志的指示，对经理工作、经济核算、降低成本与消除浪费定出了各种建议与改善办法。
