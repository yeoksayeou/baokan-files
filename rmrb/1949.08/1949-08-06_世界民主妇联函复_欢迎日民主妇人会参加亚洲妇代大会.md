Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 5th: The Chairwoman of the Japan Democratic Women's Association wrote to the Women's International Democratic Federation on June 29th, earnestly hoping to send representatives to the Asian Women's Congress to be held in Beiping this autumn, in order to quickly work with women worldwide on the cause of women's liberation. The letter also stated: The Japan Democratic Women's Association plans to unite various women's groups to hold a peace conference on August 15th, the anniversary of the defeat of Japanese fascism, to carry out the struggle to protect their livelihood. The Women's International Democratic Federation recently replied, stating: We welcome Japanese democratic women to participate in the Asian Women's Congress, and we hope that they can quickly join the ranks of the Women's International Democratic Federation. The reply also emphasized: The reason why the Asian Women's Congress has received such enthusiastic support is that it is being held in the liberated areas of China. A vast China, long subjected to oppression, has been liberated and has been transformed from a base for the Third World War, as hoped for by American imperialism, into a strong part of the world peace movement on which all people can rely.

The letter from the Chairwoman of the Japan Democratic Women's Association also briefly introduced the activities of Japanese democratic women, stating: "The Japan Democratic Women's Association is a united organization of various democratic women's groups in Japan, and it is now stronger than it was during the 'March 8th' Women's Day. Japanese women are resisting the increasingly fascist Japanese bourgeois government together with the workers. Inflation in Japan threatens the lives of workers. A woman's monthly salary is not even enough to buy a piece of clothing, and unemployment has plunged women's lives into desperation. Therefore, the Japan Democratic Women's Association is participating in the proletarian struggle to make the organization of Japanese working women even stronger."

    世界民主妇联函复
    欢迎日民主妇人会参加亚洲妇代大会
    【新华社布拉格五日电】日本民主妇人会主席于六月二十九日写信给世界民主妇联，恳切希望派代表参加今秋在北平举行的亚洲妇女代表大会，以便很快地同世界妇女共同努力于妇女解放事业。该信并称：日本民主妇人会计划在八月十五日日本法西斯战败纪念日，联合各妇女团体举行和平大会，进行保卫生存的斗争。世界民主妇联顷复信称：我们欢迎日本民主妇女参加亚洲妇女代表大会，并希望她们能很快加入到世界民主妇联的队伍中来。复信并强调指出：亚洲妇女代表大会所以能得到如此热烈的拥护，因为它是在中国解放区召开的。一个久受压迫的广大的中国，已经获得解放，已经由美帝国主义所希望的第三次世界大战的基地，转变为一个世界人民都能依靠的和平运动的强大部分。
    日本民主妇人会主席的信中，并曾简单介绍日本民主妇女的活动情形称：“日本民主妇人会是日本各民主妇女团体的联合组织，它现在比‘三八’妇女节时更加强大了。日本妇女正在与工人们一起，反抗法西斯色彩日益浓厚的日本资产阶级政府。日本的通货膨胀威胁着工人的生活，妇女每月的工资竟不够买一件衣服，而失业更使妇女生活陷于绝境。因此，日本民主妇人会正参加到无产阶级斗争中去，使日本劳动妇女的组织更为强大。”
