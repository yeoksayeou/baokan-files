    Steel enterprises across the country are taking measures to further improve the quality of steel. The twelve technical measures for small blast furnaces formulated by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have been promoted in various regions.
    In the first half of this year, especially since the launch of the high-quality, high-yield competition movement in steel enterprises in April, there has been significant progress in steel quality. In June, the qualification rate of open-hearth furnace steel nationwide reached 97.83%, and the qualification rate of converter steel increased from 67.86% in January to 91.03%. The qualification rate of pig iron in key steel enterprises reached 94.54%. The quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces was uneven in the first quarter, but now the general qualification rate has reached about 70%, and some advanced units have reached more than 90%. At present, steel enterprises in various regions are continuing to work hard to improve the qualification rate of steel products; in qualified products, they are striving to expand high-quality, first-grade steel products and gradually reduce or even eliminate third-grade products.
    The focus of improving steel quality is the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces and converter steel. This is because most of the small blast furnaces and converters are newly built enterprises, and the quality of the products is not yet stable enough.
    The key to improving the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces and converter steel lies in strengthening technical management. Based on the experience of small blast furnace production across the country this year, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has recently summarized twelve technical measures to ensure high-quality and high-yield small blast furnaces, which are being widely promoted in various regions. These twelve measures are: (1) Wash: Coal for coking must be washed. (2) Select: Iron ore must be selected. (3) Roast: Ore must be roasted, ore powder must be sintered, and limestone must be burned into quicklime as a flux. (4) Mix: Raw materials must be mixed evenly. (5) Small: Reduce the particle size of raw materials. (6) Alkaline: Create alkaline slag and increase slag alkalinity. (7) High: Increase wind temperature. (8) Large: Increase air volume. (9) Chemical: Pig iron and raw materials must be tested. (10) Manage: Establish and improve technical management systems and economic accounting systems. (11) Excellent: Implement a high-quality, high-price approach for pig iron and raw materials. (12) Fixed: Rational fixed points.
    Many steel plants are gradually implementing measures such as fixed-point supply of pig iron and stabilizing pig iron composition to facilitate steelmaking, in order to improve the quality of converter steel. Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant's graded and classified management of pig iron, and Qingdao's steelmaking units' experience in using alkaline hot-blast pig iron furnaces for desulfurization, are all effective and have been promoted in various regions. Tianjin's newly built converter steel plants—the Second and Fourth Steel Plants—have formulated operating instructions according to production processes such as material selection, batching, and pig iron melting, and have established a production post responsibility system, which has improved the qualification rate and first-grade rate of steel.

    钢铁战线上的新生力量日益成长
    小高炉生铁和转炉钢质量上升
    冶金工业部总结的小高炉十二项技术措施正在各地推行
    本报讯　全国各地钢铁企业正在采取措施进一步提高钢铁质量。冶金工业部制定的小高炉十二项技术措施，已经在各地推行。
    今年上半年，特别是自从4月份钢铁企业展开优质高产竞赛运动以来，钢铁质量已有显著的进步。6月份，全国平炉钢的合格率，已经达到97.83％，转炉钢的合格率已经从1月份的67.86％提高到91.03％，重点钢铁企业的生铁合格率达到94.54％，小高炉的生铁质量在第一季度时参差不齐，现在一般的合格率也达到了70％左右，有些先进单位已经达到90％以上。目前，各地钢铁企业正在继续努力提高钢铁产品的合格率；在合格的产品中，努力扩大优质的一级钢铁产品，逐步减少以至消灭三级品。
    提高钢铁质量的重点是小高炉生铁和转炉钢的质量。这是因为，大部分的小高炉和转炉都是新建企业，产品的质量状况还不够稳定。
    要提高小高炉生铁和转炉钢的质量，关键在于加强技术管理。冶金工业部根据今年来全国各地小高炉生产的经验，已经在最近总结出了十二项保证小高炉优质高产的技术措施，正在各地广泛推行。这十二项措施是：（一）洗：炼焦用煤要洗。（二）选：铁矿石要选。（三）烧：矿石要焙烧，矿粉要烧结，石灰石烧成生石灰作熔剂。（四）匀：原料要混匀。（五）小：减小原料粒度。（六）碱：造碱性渣，提高炉渣碱度。（七）高：提高风温。（八）大：加大风量。（九）化：生铁和原料要化验。（十）管：建立和健全技术管理制度和经济核算制度。（十一）优：生铁和原料实行优质优价的办法。（十二）定：合理定点。
    许多炼钢厂正在逐步实行生铁定点供应，稳定生铁成分以便于炼钢时掌握等措施，来提高转炉钢质量。上海第六钢厂分级、分类管理生铁，青岛市各炼钢单位运用碱性热风化铁炉脱硫等经验，都是行之有效的，已在各地推广。天津市新建的转炉炼钢厂——第二、第四炼钢厂，按照选料、配料、化铁等生产工序，制订了操作须知，建立了生产岗位负责制，钢的合格率和一级品率都提高了。
