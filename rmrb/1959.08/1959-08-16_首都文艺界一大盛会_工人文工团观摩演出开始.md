Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: A performance for observation by worker cultural troupes began today in the capital.

Participating in this performance for observation are the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' Worker Drama Troupe, Worker Song and Dance Troupe, China Railway Cultural Troupe, China Construction Song and Dance Troupe, China Coal Mine Cultural Troupe, and the Ministry of Geology's Cultural Troupe, totaling nearly one thousand people. The majority of the programs performed were self-written and directed by the cultural troupes, including dramas, operas, historical mythological dance dramas, as well as music, songs, dances, ballad singing, acrobatics, and more.

These professional worker cultural and art groups participating in the performance all possess the fine style of hard work, simplicity, and close ties with the masses. Year after year, they travel long distances, going deep into various factories, mines, and construction sites, bringing art and literature to the doorstep, greatly encouraging the workers. The China Railway Cultural Troupe has traveled almost all railway lines across the country in the past decade, visiting more than 1,790 towns and cities, performing more than 120 different programs, with audiences totaling more than 10 million people. The China Construction Song and Dance Troupe has performed for the heroes of construction sites such as the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, the Guanting Reservoir, and the Fozi嶺 Reservoir, and has also taken small-scale programs to remote construction sites to perform. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' Song and Dance Troupe has traveled more than 40,000 kilometers on tour in the past three years. In order to adapt to the mobile and dispersed characteristics of field geological teams, the Ministry of Geology's Cultural Troupe often performs for geological personnel in the flexible form of "light cavalry art teams," leaving their footprints in the high mountains of Northeast China, the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, the Qaidam Basin, Hainan Island, the Qilian Mountains, the Kangzang Plateau, and the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. When the worker cultural troupes perform in various places, they actively guide workers' amateur artistic activities, cultivating a large number of employee amateur art backbones. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' Worker Drama Troupe has conducted thousands of counseling activities for industrial and mining art organizations in various places over the past three years. This year, the China Coal Mine Cultural Troupe not only trained personnel for three coal mine professional and amateur art groups, but also ran training courses for art cadres and printed various singing materials.

    首都文艺界一大盛会
    工人文工团观摩演出开始
    据新华社15日讯　工人文工团观摩演出今天开始在首都举行。
    参加这次观摩演出的有中华全国总工会工人话剧团、工人歌舞团，中国铁路文工团，中国建筑歌舞团，中国煤矿文工团和地质部文工团，共近千人。这次演出的节目，大部分是由文工团自编自导的，其中有话剧、歌剧、历史神话舞剧，以及音乐、歌舞、曲艺、杂技等。
    参加演出的这些专业工人文艺团体，都具有艰苦朴素、密切联系群众的优良作风。他们经年累月，远途跋涉，深入各工厂矿山工地，把文艺送上门去，给工人们很大鼓舞。中国铁路文工团十年来几乎走遍全国铁路沿线，到过一千七百九十多个城镇，演出各种节目一百二十多个，观众达一千多万人次。中国建筑歌舞团，曾经为第一汽车制造厂、荆江分洪、官厅水库、佛子岭水库等建设工地的英雄们演出，也曾带着小型节目到偏僻的工地演出。中华全国总工会歌舞团三年来巡回演出的行程达四万多公里。地质部文工团为了适应野外地质队流动分散的特点，经常以“文艺轻骑队”的灵活形式为地质人员演出，在东北的高山、内蒙古的草原、柴达木盆地、海南岛、祁连山、康藏高原和云贵高原都留下了他们的足迹。各工人文工团到各地演出的时候，都积极辅导工人业余文艺活动，培养了大批职工业余文艺骨干。中华全国总工会工人话剧团三年来向各地工矿文艺组织进行了上千次的辅导活动。中国煤矿文工团今年不仅为三个煤矿专业和业余的文艺团体代训人员，并且开办文艺干部训练班和编印了各种演唱材料。
