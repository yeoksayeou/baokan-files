Grasp Political Thought and Science and Technology
The Leadership Level of the Quyang Team Party Branch is Greatly Improved

　　This newspaper reports that the Quyang Brigade Party Branch of Baofeng Commune in Huinong County, Ningxia Province, adopted the leadership method of grasping political thought and grasping science and technology, mastered agricultural science and technology, improved the leadership level, and powerfully promoted the development of agricultural production, and obtained a comprehensive bumper harvest of wheat.
　　After communization, in order to correctly implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, the Quyang Brigade, through the methods of small-plot trials and large-field promotion, studied and mastered agricultural science and technology, and led agricultural production in a practical way. Before the spring sowing this year, the brigade established an agricultural science and technology research station with the participation of cadres, veteran farmers, and young technicians, and nine production teams also established science and technology research groups. More than 150 cadres, veteran farmers, and young people in the team participated in scientific and technological research work. Under the leadership of leading cadres, they carried out research work by adopting methods such as running experimental fields, holding technical seminars, visiting and learning advanced experiences from local and foreign countries, and hiring agricultural technical cadres as consultants.
　　This year, the entire brigade has more than ten scientific experiment projects, including wheat high-yield experiments, close planting, fertilizer, irrigation, fine seed breeding, cash crop experiments, etc. Archives were established for each experiment. Niu Cunyi, the secretary of the brigade's general branch, planted one mu of experimental field with a lot of fertilizer and seeds. After the first watering, the leaves were tender and green. If the second watering was continued according to the old habit of farmers "not fearing drought in the first watering and following with a flood in the second watering", there would be a possibility of excessive growth and lodging. After several studies with veteran farmers and technical cadres, Niu Cunyi adopted the method of controlling water to suppress seedlings to prevent lodging. The second watering was thirteen or fourteen days later than the general field. As a result, the wheat grew slowly, the internodes were short, and the wheat stalks were thick and strong, without lodging. This successful experience was quickly promoted in the 568 mu of wheat fields in the entire brigade that showed signs of lodging, preventing lodging.
　　The Quyang Brigade also conducted systematic research on the combined use of the three elements of fertilizer: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Now, it can basically apply fertilizer according to the different requirements of each growth period of seedlings, and according to local conditions and seedlings. In order to improve fertilizer quality, the brigade's agricultural science research station conducted a fertilizer comparison experiment in the wheat fields of the sixth team. In the same two fields, one was applied with 48 cartloads of wild kang and stewed kang soil fertilizer, and 12 cartloads of topdressing fertilizer; the other was applied with 25 cartloads of pure manure fertilizer, and 7 cartloads of topdressing fertilizer. The experimental results showed that the wheat seedlings applied with manure fertilizer were five inches taller than those applied with soil fertilizer. The former had eight grains per ear, with many and full grains; the latter had five grains per ear, with only two grains in each, and some with only one grain. The brigade held an on-site meeting at the field to analyze the various nutrients contained in the fertilizers and their different effects on crop growth to the members. After the masses recognized the importance of improving fertilizer quality, under the leadership of the Party branch, they reformed all 21 livestock pens in the team within seven days, fixed 220 laborers, and adopted scientific methods to accumulate and compost fertilizer.
　　After the cadres mastered agricultural production technology and knowledge through experiments and research, they had a bottom line in leading production, had sufficient confidence, had many methods, and the work changed from passive to active, promoting the development of production. As the captain, Ma Yanhe, said: "After learning and mastering agricultural scientific knowledge and production technology, the courage of leadership has increased, the capital has increased, and production will develop faster and better."

### 抓政治思想抓科学技术　渠羊队党总支领导水平大提高

　　抓政治思想抓科学技术
　　渠羊队党总支领导水平大提高
    本报讯　宁夏省惠农县宝丰公社渠羊大队党总支采取抓政治思想和抓科学技术的领导方法，掌握了农业科学技术，提高了领导水平，有力地推动了农业生产的发展，获得了小麦全面大丰收。
    渠羊大队在公社化后，为了正确地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，通过小田试验、大田推广的办法，学习研究掌握农业科学技术，有虚有实地领导农业生产。在今年春播前，大队成立了有干部、老农、青年技术员参加的农业科学技术研究站，九个生产小队也成立了科学技术研究小组。全队有一百五十多名干部、老农、青年参加了科学技术研究工作，他们在领导干部带动下，采用搞试验田、开技术座谈会、参观学习本地和外地先进经验和聘请农业技术干部当顾问等方式进行研究工作。
    今年，全大队科学试验项目共有十多个，其中有小麦高额丰产试验，密植、肥料、浇水、良种繁植、经济作物等试验，每种试验都建立了档案资料。大队总支书记牛存义种的一亩试验田，肥多、下种量大，在淌完头水后叶子嫩绿，如果按照农民“头水不怕旱、二水跟着漫”的老习惯接着淌二水，就有徒长倒伏的可能，牛存义经过和老农、技术干部几次研究，采取了勒水蹲苗防倒伏的办法，二水比一般田迟淌了十三、四天，结果麦子生长慢、拔节短、麦秆粗壮，没有倒伏。这个成功经验很快就在全大队有倒伏迹象的五百六十八亩麦田推广，防止了倒伏。
    渠羊大队还对肥料氮、磷、钾三要素的搭配使用，进行了系统的研究，现在基本上能按禾苗各个生长期的不同要求，做到因地因苗施肥。为了提高肥质，大队农业科学研究站在六小队麦田中进行了肥料对比试验。在同样的两块田中，一块施野炕、焖炕土肥四十八车，追肥十二车；另一块施纯圈肥二十五车，追肥七车。试验结果，施圈肥的麦苗比施土肥的高五寸，前者一穗八仓、粒多粒饱；后者一穗五仓，每仓只有两粒，有的只一粒。大队在田边召开了现场会，向社员分析了肥料中所含的各种养分和它们对作物生长的不同作用。群众认清了提高肥质的重要性以后，在党支部领导下，七天内就改革了全队二十一个畜圈棚，固定了二百二十个劳动力，采取科学的办法积、沤肥料。
    通过试验和研究，干部掌握了农业生产技术和知识以后，领导生产心中有了底，信心足，办法多，工作由被动转入主动，促进了生产的发展。正如大队长马彦和说的：“学习和掌握了农业科学知识和生产技术以后，领导的胆子大了，本钱多了，生产发展的就会又快又好”。
