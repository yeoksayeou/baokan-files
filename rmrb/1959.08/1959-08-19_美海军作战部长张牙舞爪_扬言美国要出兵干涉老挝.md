Xinhua News Agency, August 18th Dispatch from Washington: U.S. Naval Operations Chief Arleigh Burke brazenly threatened on the 17th that the United States would militarily intervene in the Laotian civil war.

	Before being sworn in for his third term as U.S. Naval Operations Chief, Burke spoke with reporters about the Laotian situation. When a reporter asked if it was possible to order the U.S. Navy to engage in operations in the Laotian region, Burke replied that the situation in Laos was “very serious.” He threatened that U.S. engagement in operations in the Laotian region “is possible.” When a reporter further asked what actions the U.S. Navy might take, Burke bluntly said, “If the United States believes the situation requires it to provide military support, the Navy will send a carrier task force to the region.”

	To find a pretext for U.S. armed intervention in the Laotian civil war, Burke went so far as to fabricate rumors and slander that China is making “quite desperate efforts” to incite turmoil.

　　美海军作战部长张牙舞爪
　　扬言美国要出兵干涉老挝
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：美国海军作战部长伯克17日公然威胁美国要武装干涉老挝内战。
    伯克在宣誓第三次就任美国海军作战部长前同新闻记者们谈到了老挝局势。当记者问他是否有可能下令美国海军在老挝地区投入行动时，伯克回答说：老挝的局势是“非常严重的”，他扬言美国在老挝地区投入行动“是可能的”。当记者进一步问到美国海军可能采取什么行动时，伯克露骨地说，“如果美国认为局势要求美国给予军事上的支持，海军将派一支航空母舰特遣部队到这个地区。”
    伯克为了替美国寻找武装干涉老挝内战的借口，竟不惜造谣诬蔑中国正在“相当拼命地努力”试图挑起动乱。
