Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 19th: Wu Lianghu, a young foreman in the freight car workshop of the Jiang’an Vehicle Factory in Wuhan, twice left the advanced production team he led to work in backward teams, making all three teams advanced units in the workshop. In early August, all three teams he led comprehensively overfulfilled their production plans, with product quality qualification rates all reaching an advanced level of 98% or higher.

Wu Lianghu is twenty-three years old this year and a member of the Communist Party. Since October 1954, for more than four years, he has never produced a single defective product and has overfulfilled his production tasks every month. After the Jiang’an Vehicle Factory shifted from repairing vehicles to manufacturing vehicles at the end of March last year, he was responsible for the scribing work of the center beam, drawing rivet holes on steel plates. His work quality was very good, but he soon discovered that the next process—the drilling process—could not accurately find the center, drilling the rivet holes he had drawn neatly askew, affecting the quality of the newly manufactured freight cars. This incident made him deeply realize that relying on one person to work well is not enough to produce high-quality products. He went to the drilling team and used his spare time to work with the workers to study and improve methods. Later, during a visit to the Wuchang Vehicle Factory, he was inspired by a tool and, upon returning, created a set of molds with veteran workers and technicians to ensure the quality of the drilled rivet holes and increase work efficiency sixfold. From April last year to the present, he has helped others innovate fifteen important tools. The use of these innovative tools has not only improved quality but also increased production efficiency by six to twenty-four times.

In April of this year, the production performance of the scribing team led by Wu Lianghu was very good, but the product quality of the adjacent skeleton team was often poor. To advance together as a collective, Wu Lianghu and Party member Liu Keqin obeyed the Party's assignment and went to the skeleton team to serve as foremen. Wu Lianghu and Liu Keqin first influenced the workers in the team with their own enthusiasm, and then launched a competition in the team. Through their efforts and the efforts of all the workers in the team, this team soon became an advanced team with high quality and high output every month.

In mid-June, when the scribing team and the skeleton team were both leaping forward in production, Wu Lianghu also noticed the long-standing rework problem in the sheet metal blanking team. The rework rate of this team reached about 60%, causing several processes to stop frequently. He often went to this team to inquire about the reasons. At this time, the Party again sent him and Liu Keqin to the blanking team to serve as foremen. After they arrived in the team, they mobilized the workers to check the reasons and found that the main problems with poor quality were incorrect operation methods and chaotic management. They innovated the operation methods with the workers, and Wu Lianghu also reformed several tools himself. Under the joint efforts of the two foremen and all the workers in the team, the quality of the team's products has maintained an advanced level and become an advanced team in the workshop.

During the August and September production increase and economy movement, the scribing team, the skeleton team, and the blanking team achieved a common leap forward. In early August, all three teams comprehensively overfulfilled their production plans, with quality qualification rates above 98%. The blanking team currently led by Wu Lianghu had completed 80% of the monthly task of forty major repairs and more than 99% of the blanking tasks for this year's new construction by August 15th.

Wu Lianghu's selfless, communist style of putting the collective first has been valued and commended by the Party. At the Wuhan City Youth Workers Activists Conference held on August 14th, Song Yiping, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, called on all young people in the city to learn from Wu Lianghu in the current new upsurge of production increase and economy, and asked advanced individuals to play a bridge role among the masses, helping others ideologically and in their work, and bringing the people around them to advance like themselves. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League awarded him the title of "Red Flag Youth" and a medal. Young advanced producers also took the stage to express their determination to learn from Wu Lianghu's spirit. The Wang Wenlin Advanced Youth Machine Team of Wuchang Shipyard proposed that they should not only strive to achieve advanced production records themselves but also help others achieve advanced records. Chen Ai'e, a famous textile expert from the No. 1 State-owned Cotton Mill, and twelve advanced producers, including Ning Guizhen, Wang Qun, and Ye Yunqing, proposed that each person should contract to help one person catch up with their own advanced level by the end of the year; they would go wherever there were backward teams to help.

Wu Lianghu's deeds have now spread throughout Wuhan. The Communist Youth League organizations of the textile system have decided to organize advanced young workers to help others and launch a mass movement of learning from and catching up with each other among young textile workers in the city. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League also made a resolution, calling on advanced young people and youth in the city to learn from Wu Lianghu, actively help others, catch up with the advanced, and work hard in August and September to greet the 10th anniversary of the National Day with outstanding achievements.

This is the cooler they are installing, which will be put into production along with the No. 1 sintering machine. Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Limen photo

    帮助两个落后小组赶上先进水平
　　吴良湖高举集体主义大旗
　　中共武汉市委号召先进生产者充分发挥桥梁作用，把周围的人带动起来，让大家都和自己一样
    新华社武汉19日电　武汉江岸车辆厂货车车间青年工长吴良湖，两次离开自己领导的先进生产小组，到落后小组去工作，使三个小组都成为车间里的先进单位。8月上旬，他领导过的三个小组都全面超额地完成了生产计划，产品质量合格率全部达到98％以上的先进水平。
    吴良湖今年二十三岁，共产党员。从1954年10月起，四年多来他从未出过一件废品，月月都超额完成生产任务。去年3月底，江岸车辆厂由修理车辆转为制造车辆后，他担任中梁的画线工作，在钢板上画铆钉眼子。他的工作质量很好，但是他不久发现他的下一道工序——钻眼工序，因为找不准圆心，把他画得整整齐齐的铆钉眼子，钻得歪歪斜斜，影响到新造货车的质量。这件事使他深刻认识到，光靠一个人工作得好，是制造不出优质产品来的。他就跑到钻眼组，利用工余时间找工人们一起研究改进办法。后来他在武昌车辆厂参观时，从一件工具中得到启发，回来就和老工人、技术员一起创造了一种套模，保证钻出的铆钉眼子的质量，而且使工作效率提高了六倍。从去年4月到现在，他帮助别人革新的重要工具就有十五件。这些革新工具使用后，不仅提高了质量，并使生产效率提高六倍到二十四倍。
    今年4月，吴良湖领导的画线小组生产成绩很好，可是邻近的骨架组产品质量却经常不好。为了集体一起跃进，吴良湖和党员刘克勤一起服从党的分配，到骨架组去当工长。吴良湖和刘克勤先以自己的干劲去影响小组里的工人，接着又在小组里发动了竞赛，经过他们和全组工人的努力，这个组不久就成为月月优质高产的先进小组。
    6月中旬，当画线组、骨架组生产双双跃进的时候，吴良湖又注意到了钣钢下料组长期存在的返工问题。这个组的返工率达到60％左右，以致几个工序经常停工。他经常到这个组去探问原因，这时，党又派他和刘克勤到下料组去当工长。他们到小组后就发动工人检查原因，找出了质量不好的主要问题是操作方法不对，管理混乱。他们就和工人一起革新了操作方法，吴良湖又自己动手改革了几件工具。在他们两个工长和全组工人共同努力下，小组产品的质量一直保持先进的水平，成为车间里的先进小组。
    在大战八、九月的增产节约运动中，画线组、骨架组、下料组实现了共同跃进。8月上旬，三个组都全面超额完成了生产计划，质量合格率在98％以上。吴良湖现在领导的下料组，到8月15日为止，已经完成了全月四十辆大修任务的80％，和今年新造成下料任务的99％以上。
    吴良湖这种大公无私，一切为了集体的共产主义风格，受到了党的重视和表扬。在8月14日召开的武汉全市六千名青年工人活动分子大会上，中共武汉市委书记宋一平号召全市青年在当前的增产节约新高潮中，都向吴良湖学习，要求先进分子在群众中起桥梁作用，在思想上、工作上帮助别人，把周围的人带动起来，让大家都和自己一样先进。共青团武汉市委授予他“红旗青年”的称号和奖章。青年先进生产者也纷纷上台表示要学习吴良湖的精神。武昌造船厂王文林先进青年机台提出，他们不仅自己要努力达到先进的生产纪录，并且要帮助别人达到先进纪录。国棉一厂著名纺织能手陈爱娥和宁桂珍、王群、叶云清等十二个先进生产者提出，在年底前每人要包干帮助一个人赶上自己的先进水平；哪里有落后小组就到哪里去帮助。
    吴良湖的事迹现在已传遍全武汉。纺织系统的共青团组织已决定把先进青年工人组织起来帮助别人，在全市青年纺织工人中开展一个你追我赶的群众运动。共青团武汉市委也作出决议，号召全市青年先进分子和青年向吴良湖学习，积极帮助别人，追赶先进，大干8、9两月，以出色的成绩迎接国庆十周年。（附图片）
