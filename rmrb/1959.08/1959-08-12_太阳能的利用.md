The Significance of Solar Energy Utilization in Power Economics

According to historical records, as early as the Tang Dynasty (around 650 AD), China had already produced solar fire-starting tools called "Yang Sui." It was a round, copper concave mirror that reflected and concentrated sunlight onto a single point to obtain high temperatures. This shows that the working people of China mastered the principle of utilizing solar radiant heat very early on. Since liberation, with the rapid growth of industrial and agricultural production and the gradual improvement of people's lives, the demand for energy has increased sharply, especially since the Great Leap Forward last year. Therefore, the utilization of solar energy has also been valued by all parties. From the development trend of energy utilization in various countries in recent years, due to the large increase in the consumption of natural fuels, and the reserves of natural fuels are ultimately limited, they cannot meet the increasing needs of mankind. At the same time, with the progress of the chemical industry, coal and petroleum have also become important raw materials for manufacturing some valuable chemical products, and the use of natural fuels in power will be reduced accordingly. Therefore, power economists in many countries are actively looking for new power sources.

So what is a new power source? Which energy source can be practically applied in human daily life? It is clear that the utilization of atomic energy and solar radiation energy (broadly speaking, it can include water energy, tidal energy, and wind energy directly related to solar energy) will have more development prospects than the utilization of natural fuel energy.

There is great potential for solar energy utilization. Solar radiation is almost an inexhaustible and inexhaustible energy source. Professor Weinberg of the Soviet Union calculated that only two billionths of the solar energy is shot into the highest atmosphere of the earth, but its energy has reached 180 trillion kilowatts. In addition to atmospheric reflection and absorption, about 80 trillion kilowatts reach the ground, of which the energy absorbed by the land is about 17 trillion kilowatts. In other words, the solar radiation heat received by the Earth's surface in ten days is equivalent to the total calorific value of coal mines stored all over the world.

China is located between 4 degrees and 53 degrees north latitude, with three climates: hot, temperate, and cold. Most of the country's territory is in the North Temperate Zone, with an area of nearly 10 million square kilometers. The solar radiation energy projected onto the mainland of China is equivalent to 1.2 trillion kilowatts. This is a very astonishing figure. If we can make full use of it, it will be equivalent to the total energy of 12 million 100,000-kilowatt power stations. In general, in areas with 1,800 hours of sunshine per year, solar energy utilization has good value, while in the vast areas of Northeast, North China, Northwest China, Inner Mongolia, and the Tibetan Plateau, the annual sunshine hours are as high as 2,500 to 3,000 hours. In some areas of East China and South China, the annual sunshine hours are also more than 2,000 hours. Therefore, it is very advantageous geographical conditions for us to widely use solar energy in our country.

Methods of Solar Energy Utilization

So far, there is no good method to directly convert solar energy into energy. A large amount of solar radiant heat is absorbed by the land and the ocean, so that the soil and sea water maintain a certain temperature, and a large amount of water evaporates. Only a small amount of radiant heat is absorbed by plants through photosynthesis and turned into chemical energy.

From an energy point of view, the efficiency of solar energy utilization devices is higher than the efficiency of natural solar energy utilization. For example, the efficiency of a reflecting mirror solar boiler is between 60% and 70%, and the efficiency of a solar stove is between 50% and 60%. The efficiency of solar photovoltaic cells has now reached 11%. Solar water heaters can raise the water temperature to 55°C to 60°C, and their thermal efficiency is 30%-45%.

However, these solar energy utilization devices cannot be widely used at present, mainly due to the following two shortcomings: (1) The amount of heat received per unit area on the earth is too small (about two calories per square decimeter per minute, that is, 0.1394 watts per square decimeter). It is necessary to use a large-area reflector or heating surface, which increases equipment costs. (2) Solar radiation energy changes with time, and the energy supply is unstable, so it is necessary to have an auxiliary energy source (such as natural fuel) and its auxiliary equipment, or to use energy storage equipment. The cost of these auxiliary equipment is very high, and it also increases operational difficulties.

In terms of high temperature, a large-area parabolic mirror and focusing system can be used to concentrate solar energy on a focal point, which can reach a high temperature of about 3000°C, which can be used to dissolve high-melting-point metals or manufacture special alloys. The advantage of radiant heating with a high-temperature solar furnace is that there is no direct contact with electrodes or heating agents, thus ensuring the purity of the heated body.

The more widely used and promising application in the future may be solar heating equipment for building construction. This belongs to the application in the low-temperature range. Warm rooms, warm beds, dryers, water heaters, and solar bathrooms are also common low-temperature solar energy devices in daily life. In terms of power, huge reflectors or a large number of small-area standard reflectors can be used to concentrate sunlight on a boiler, and the steam generated in the boiler is used to drive a steam engine or steam turbine. For example, the Soviet Union is now trying to build a solar steam power station in the southern region with a power generation of 750 to 1,000 kilowatts. The reflector area is 20,000 square meters, the steam temperature is 350°C, and the pressure is 16 atmospheres. The designed annual sunshine time is 1,800 hours.

A solar photovoltaic cell is a device that directly converts solar energy into electrical energy. Its advantage is that there are no mechanical moving parts, so it avoids the shortcomings of mechanical losses and component maintenance. At present, the efficiency of solar photovoltaic cells is still very low, and the cost is high. A large number of batteries and a large light-receiving area are required to generate a small amount of current, so it cannot be applied to daily life.

In the third artificial satellite launched by the Soviet Union, solar photovoltaic cells have been successfully used to drive wireless communication equipment, opening up a new path for solar energy utilization. There are many types of raw materials for manufacturing solar photovoltaic cells. For example, selenium, sulfides, and intermetallic compounds can be made into photovoltaic cells with different power; in addition, semiconductor materials such as germanium and silicon single crystals can be used to make semiconductor photovoltaic cell components after special treatment.

China's Achievements in Solar Energy Utilization

Under the care and support of the Party, the research and trial production of solar energy utilization devices and solar power machinery have made great progress. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, mass solar energy utilization work was launched nationwide. Solar water pumps, solar bathrooms, solar stoves, distillers, and air preheating solar dryers and other equipment were manufactured.

China's achievements in solar energy utilization devices mainly include three aspects: water heaters and reflectors, solar water pumps, and solar photovoltaic cells.

(1) Water Heaters and Reflectors

Many places in China are conducting experiments on water heaters and reflectors. The Shanghai Solar Energy Equipment Factory has established a solar bathroom with a heat-receiving area of 60 square meters in the Guangzhou Municipal Garden Administration, which produces 80 kilograms of 50°C to 60°C hot water per square meter of heat-receiving surface every day. Pingliang Middle School built a solar bathroom with a heat-receiving area of 3.96 square meters in May 1957. In summer, it can obtain 400 liters of 80°C to 86°C hot water every day. In terms of reflectors, the Shanghai Solar Energy Equipment Factory has manufactured an accurate aluminum alloy parabolic mirror solar high-temperature furnace, which can reach a temperature of 1000°C to 2000°C. Pingliang Middle School manufactured a solar energy and charcoal dual-purpose tea stove, which consists of a boiler and an outdoor reflector. It uses pendulum machinery to automatically align with the sun. It works for nine hours a day and can produce 450 liters of boiling water, with a power equivalent to a 4-kilowatt electric heater.

(2) Solar Water Pump

In 1958, the Thermal Engineering Teaching and Research Group of Shanghai Jiaotong University collaborated with the Shanghai Solar Energy Equipment Manufacturing Factory to preliminarily produce a solar water pump. It is a drainage and irrigation machine that uses a parabolic mirror solar steam generator to drive a steam water pump. It is simple to manufacture and does not consume fuel. The non-piston steam water pump used is composed of a steam valve, a cylinder, two check valves, and some pipes. When steam enters the cylinder, it applies pressure to the water in the cylinder to open the check valve at the discharge port, and the water is pressed to the outside of the outlet pipe. After a certain amount of water is discharged, the water level in the cylinder drops to a relatively low position, the steam valve closes. At this time, the cooling surface of the cylinder is large, and the water discharged from the pipe has a continuous outward momentum. A vacuum is quickly formed in the cylinder, and then water is sucked into the cylinder from the suction pipe. This cycle repeats. On a cloudless sunny day, a 10-square-meter parabolic mirror can generate 5 kilograms of steam at 2 atmospheres of pressure per hour in a solar steam boiler. Steam can be produced after 15 minutes of irradiation, and the water pump can pump about 4 tons per hour.

(3) Solar Photovoltaic Cell

Research on using semiconductor components to directly convert solar light energy and heat energy into electrical energy also started during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The Power Research Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the semiconductor teaching and research groups of many universities have successively trial-produced cuprous oxide, selenium, sulfide, germanium and calcium photovoltaic cells. Many industrial departments have also studied various types of photoelectric and thermoelectric components, and some solar photovoltaic cells, such as selenium photovoltaic cells, have already begun production.

Several Opinions on Solar Energy Utilization

Widely using solar energy as a power energy and thermal energy source has significant economic value. In order to improve the efficiency of current solar energy equipment and develop research on new types of solar energy utilization equipment, the following work can be considered in the future.

(1) Establish measurement stations to record solar characteristics (such as solar intensity and sunshine hours) in major representative areas across the country, and systematically organize and analyze the obtained data. According to the energy resource conditions of each region, determine the regions where it is economically reasonable to utilize solar energy and the appropriate methods for utilizing solar energy.

(2) Research and develop simple, efficient, and suitable for mass production methods and devices for utilizing solar energy. In particular, we should actively research water pumps, refrigeration machinery, boiling water devices, dryers, and housing heating equipment that are suitable for the needs of the vast rural areas of our country.

(3) Carry out research on cutting-edge technologies in the scientific field of solar energy utilization, such as high-temperature solar furnaces, solar thermal power stations, solar photovoltaic cells, and solar thermoelectric power generation equipment.

(4) Use photochemical decomposition, electrolysis, microorganisms, and rapid growth of seaweed to study the storage of solar energy.

(5) Develop thermal calculation methods for various solar energy equipment that can be directly applied by production departments.

(6) Research the manufacturing method of special materials with high solar spectral absorption rate on the surface of objects and small heat radiation loss under low-temperature conditions, and identify its thermal radiation performance and economy. So that it can be widely used on the absorption surfaces of various solar energy utilization devices.

　　太阳能的利用
　　中国科学院动力研究室副研究员　葛绍岩
　　太阳能利用在动力经济上的意义
    根据历史的记载，远在唐朝时（公元650年左右）我国已制成太阳能取火工具，称为阳燧。它是用圆形铜质凹面镜，将阳光反射并聚集在一点上来获得高温的。这说明我国劳动人民很早就已掌握了利用太阳能辐射热的原理。解放以后，随着工农业生产的迅速增长，人民生活逐步提高，人们对于能源的需要急剧增加，特别是去年大跃进以来这个情况更为明显，所以太阳能利用亦被各方重视起来。从近年来世界各国能源利用情况发展趋势来看，由于天然燃料的消耗量大大增加，而天然燃料的储藏量究竟有一限度，远不能满足人类日益增长的需要。同时随着化学工业的进展，煤和石油又成为制造一些贵重化学品的重要原料，天然燃料在动力方面的使用量将相应减少。因而许多国家的动力经济学家都在积极寻找新的动力能源。
    究竟什么是新的动力能源呢？哪种能源可以在人类日常生活中得到实际的运用？很显然的是原子能的利用和太阳辐射能（广义地说，可以包括同太阳能直接有关的水能、潮汐能和风能）的利用。这些能源的利用将比天然燃料能源的利用更有发展前途。
    太阳能利用有很大的可能性。太阳辐射几乎是一个取之不尽、用之不竭的巨大能源。苏联温别尔格教授计算，只有二十亿分之一的太阳能射到地球最高的大气层，但其能量已达一百八十万亿瓩，除去大气反射和吸收外，到达地面的约有八十万亿瓩，其中陆地上吸收的能量约等于十七万亿瓩。换言之，地球表面十天内所受到的太阳辐射热量，就相当于世界各地储藏煤矿的总发热量。
    我国处于北纬四度到五十三度，兼有热、温、寒三带气候，全国大部分领土在北温带，面积将近一千万平方公里，投射到我国大陆的太阳辐射能相当于一万二千亿瓩。这是一个非常惊人的数字。若能全部被我们利用的话，就相当于一千二百万座十万瓩的发电站的总能量。一般在年照时数为一千八百小时的地区，已有较好的太阳能利用价值，而在我国广大东北、华北、西北、内蒙古及西藏高原一带，年照时间高达二千五百至三千小时，在华东和华南部分地区年照时间也有二千小时以上。所以在我国广泛地利用太阳能是具有很有利的地理条件。
          太阳能利用的方法
    到目前为止，还没有很好的方法直接把太阳能转变为能源。大量的太阳辐射热为陆地和海洋吸收，使土壤和海水维持一定的温度，并使大量水分蒸发。只有少量的辐射热经光合作用后被植物吸收变为化学能。
    从能量的观点来看，太阳能利用装置的效率比太阳能自然利用的效率要高。例如反射镜式太阳能锅炉的效率在60％至70％之间，太阳灶的效率在50％至60％之间。太阳能光电池的效率目前也已达到11％。太阳能热水器可将水温升到55°C至60°C，其热效率为30％—45％。
    但是这些太阳能利用装置目前还不能大规模应用，主要是由于下列两个缺点：（1）地球上单位面积所受到的热量过小（每平方分米每分钟约二卡，即零点一三九四瓦每平方分米），须用面积很大的反射镜或受热面，设备费用增大。（2）太阳能辐射能量随时间改变，所供应的能量不稳定，故需要有辅助能源（如天然燃料）的供应及其附属设备，或采用储能设备，这些附属设备的费用甚高，而且增加了操作上的困难。
    在高温方面，可利用大面积抛物面反射镜和聚光系统，将太阳能聚集在一个焦点上，可以达到3000°C左右的高温，用以溶解高熔点金属，或制造特殊合金。用高温太阳炉辐射加热的优点是没有电极或加热剂的直接接触，因而保证了加热体的纯洁。
    目前应用较广而在今后也有发展前途的，可能是房屋建筑的太阳能采暖设备。这属于低温范围内的应用。暖房、暖床、干燥器、热水器和太阳能浴室等也都是日常生活中常见的低温太阳能装置。在动力方面，可利用巨型的反射镜或大量的小面积标准反射镜，将太阳光集中到锅炉上，用锅炉内产生的蒸汽推动蒸汽机或蒸汽轮机。如苏联现在南方地区试建一台发电量为七百五十至一千瓩的太阳能蒸汽电站，反射镜面积为二万平方米，蒸汽温度为350°C，压力为十六大气压。设计年日照时间为一千八百小时。
    太阳能光电池是一种把太阳能直接变为电能的器件，它的优点是没有机械运动部件，所以免去机械损失和部件维修的缺点。目前太阳能光电池的效率还很低，而成本高，需要大量的电池和大的受光面积，才能发出少量的电流，所以还不能应用到日常生活中去。
    在苏联发射的第三颗人造卫星中，已成功地运用了太阳能光电池带动无线通讯设备，为太阳能利用开辟了一条新的道路。制造太阳能光电池的原料种类很多，例如硒，硫化物和金属间化合物等都可以制成不同功率的光电池；另外，可利用半导体材料如锗和硅等单晶体经特殊处理后制成半导体光电池元件。
      我国在太阳能利用方面的成就
    在党的关怀和支持下，太阳能利用装置和太阳能动力机械的研究和试制工作，有了很大的进展。 1958年大跃进中，全国普遍展开了群众性的太阳能利用工作。制成了太阳能水泵、太阳能浴室、太阳灶、蒸馏器和空气予热式太阳能干燥器等设备。
    我国太阳能利用装置的成就主要有热水器和反射器、太阳能水泵和太阳能光电池等三个方面。
      （1）热水器和反射器
    我国有许多地方正在进行热水器和反射器的试验工作。上海太阳能器械厂在广州市园林管理处建立了一座受热面积为六十平方米的太阳能浴室，每平方米受热面每日产生八十公斤50°C到60°C的热水。平凉中学在1957年5月建成了受热面积为三点九六平方米的太阳能浴室，夏季每日可得80°C至86°C热水四百公升。在反射器方面，上海太阳能器械厂制成了精确的铝合金抛物面镜式太阳高温炉，温度可达1000°C至2000°C。平凉中学制造成太阳能及炭火二用茶炉，由锅炉及室外反射器二部分组成，利用钟摆机械自动对准太阳，每日工作九小时，可出沸水450公升，功率相当于4瓩的电热器。
      （2）太阳能水泵
    1958年上海交通大学热工教研组与上海市太阳器械制造厂协作，初步制成了太阳能水泵。它是一种利用抛物面反射镜式太阳能蒸汽发生器来驱动蒸汽水泵的排灌机械，制造简单，不消耗燃料。所用的无活塞式蒸汽水泵由蒸汽阀、汽缸、两个止回阀和一些管子组成。当蒸汽进入汽缸内，加压力于汽缸内的水使排出口的止回阀打开，水即被压至出口管外。当排水到若干数量以后，汽缸内水位下降到相当低的位置时，蒸汽阀关闭，此时汽缸的冷却表面很大，且排出管外的水有连续向外冲的惯性。汽缸内很快地形成真空，接着就有水从吸水管吸入汽缸内，如此周而复始，在无云的晴天，十平方米抛物面形反射镜可使太阳能蒸汽锅每小时产生二个大汽压的蒸汽五公斤，经十五分钟照射后即可出汽，水泵抽水量每小时可达4吨左右。
        （3）太阳能光电池
    关于利用半导体元件将太阳能的光能和热能直接转变为电能的研究工作，也在1958年大跃进中开展起来。中国科学院动力研究室和许多高等学校的半导体教研组都先后试制了氧化亚铜、硒、硫化物、锗与銈的光电池，许多产业部门也都研究了各种类型的光电、热电元件，并且一部分太阳能光电池如硒光电池等，已经开始生产。
      对太阳能利用工作的几点意见
    广泛地利用太阳能作为动力能源及热能能源，具有重大的经济价值。为了提高目前太阳能器械的效率和展开太阳能利用新型设备的研究，今后可以考虑进行下列这些工作。
    （1）在全国有代表性的主要地区，建立记录日照特性（如日照强度和日照时数）的测量站，对所得资料进行系统的整理和分析。根据各地区能量资源的情况，确定出在经济上合理地利用太阳能的地区和利用太阳能的适宜方式。
    （2）研究出结构简单，效率高和适宜于大量生产的利用太阳能的方法和装置。特别是对适合我国广大农村需要的水泵、制冷机械、沸水器、干燥器、房舍取暖设备等应该积极进行研究。
    （3）开展对太阳能利用这门科学领域中的尖端性技术的研究，如高温太阳炉、太阳能热电站、太阳能光电池和太阳能温差发电设备等。
    （4）利用光化学分解、电解、微生物及海藻快速生长等方法研究太阳能的储蓄。
    （5）对各种太阳能设备做出能为生产部门直接应用的热力计算方法。
    （6）研究物体表面对太阳能辐射光谱吸收率较高，而对低温状态下热辐射损失较小的特殊材料的制造方法，并鉴定其热辐射性能及其经济性。以便在各种太阳能利用装置的吸收表面上普遍采用。
