    New Substation in Tangshan Begins Operation

    (Our dispatch) A new 110,000-volt substation built in the southern suburbs of Tangshan City has now begun operation. The completion of this substation will meet the electricity needs of the iron smelting workshop of the Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, the Tangshan Coking Plant, the local industry in Fengrun District, and the construction of farmland water conservancy in some areas.

    This substation is a new type of power substation designed and constructed by the Tangshan Power Supply Bureau itself. The equipment's control and operation are fully automated, and various relay protection devices are installed for separate lines and sections to better prevent various accidents. During construction, in order to ensure the substation's operation on schedule, the employees of the engineering department carried out a red flag competition, adopted rapid construction with cross-flowing operations, and methods such as "passing five checkpoints" (individual checkpoint, team leader checkpoint, team leader checkpoint, section chief checkpoint, operating unit checkpoint) and not handing over if the project quality is not good, and not handing over if the user department is not satisfied, ensuring the project quality and accelerating the project progress. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the construction and avoid waste, the designers adopted a "group consultation" approach to ensure that errors did not leave the building. In their on-the-job labor, they promptly studied and resolved key issues in the construction, made careful calculations, and actively used substitutes and old equipment, reducing investment by more than 100,000 yuan compared to the plan.

    唐山新变电站开始运行
    本报讯　在唐山市南郊新建成的一座十一万千伏电压的变电站，现在已经开始运行。这座变电站的建成，将满足唐山机车车辆工厂炼铁车间、唐山焦化厂以及丰润区地方工业和部分地区农田水利建设用电的需要。
    这座变电站是唐山供电局自己设计、自己组织施工的一座新型电力变电站。设备的控制和操作全部是自动化装置，分线分段装有各种继电保护设备，能够更好地防范各种事故的发生。在施工时为了使电站按期运行，工程处职工开展了红旗竞赛，采用了交叉流水作业的快速施工，以及“过五关”（个人关、组长关、班长关、处主任关、运行单位关）和工程质量不好不交，使用部门不满意不交等方法，保证了工程质量，也加快了工程进度。设计人员为了保证施工顺利进行，避免浪费，采取了“群医会诊”的方式，作到了错误不出门。他们在跟班劳动中，及时研究和解决施工中的关键问题，精打细算，积极使用代用品和旧设备，使投资比计划减少了十万多元。
