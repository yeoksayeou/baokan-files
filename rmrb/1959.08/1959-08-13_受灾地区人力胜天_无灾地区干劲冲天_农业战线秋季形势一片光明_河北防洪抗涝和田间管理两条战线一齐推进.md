　　Disaster Areas Overcome Nature; Undisaster Areas Overflow with Enthusiasm
　　Agricultural Front Autumn Situation is Bright
　　Hebei Flood Prevention and Waterlogging Combat and Field Management Advance on Two Fronts Simultaneously

　　This newspaper Tianjin 10th dispatch (Reporter Da Chang): On the vast fields of Hebei Province, more than 20 million agricultural troops are divided into two fronts, taking autumn harvest from nature with great fearless spirit. One front is on the reservoirs and dams along the large and small rivers from the mountains to the plains, where 1.26 million flood control troops are fighting fiercely against torrential rains and floods day and night. The other front is a vast autumn comprehensive overproduction movement centered on late-stage autumn field management and fertilizer accumulation and topdressing. The difficulties caused by climate imbalance cannot defeat the heroic sons and daughters of Yan and Zhao. Some factors unfavorable to increased production have been or are being overcome. Generally speaking, the situation on the agricultural front is bright, and a new production upsurge is forming. Grasp the crucial moment of "determining the year and determining the harvest"
    Since the beginning of summer this year, Hebei Province has had favorable rainfall in the early stages, and various autumn crops have grown better than in previous years. However, starting from the second half of July, torrential rains have concentratedly poured down in small areas and short periods of time, causing floods in some areas such as Tangshan and Baoding, and causing local damage to good crops. Currently, the rainy season has not passed, and it is the crucial moment to "determine the year and determine the harvest." The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China analyzed the current situation and instructed Party committees at all levels to divide the fronts and strengthen leadership, with secretaries taking command and cadres going to the fields, to further deepen the overproduction competition movement, fight hard in August and September, and seize a comprehensive bumper harvest. The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that the current main direction of struggle is flood prevention, waterlogging combat, increased topdressing, weed removal, and pest control. In order to victoriously carry out the battle for autumn harvest, first, it is necessary to continue to mobilize the entire Party and the entire people to carry out a large-scale discussion, recognize the favorable situation, overcome the right-leaning conservatism and fear of difficulty and discouragement of some cadres, continue to exert full efforts, advance victoriously, and seize a comprehensive bumper harvest; second, the contracting of work and production must be fully implemented to the teams. At present, more than 30% of the teams have not yet implemented the contracting of production. It is necessary to make sure that all teams implement the contracting of production through mass discussions, formulate overproduction plans, and arouse the overproduction enthusiasm of commune members; third, further improve labor management and improve labor efficiency, mainly by implementing various responsibility systems according to local conditions; fourth, adjust the division of labor of Party committee secretaries at all levels, divide the leadership fronts, and not only grain, cotton, and oil crops should have dedicated secretaries, but also agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries should all have dedicated personnel in charge. Leading cadres should go deep into the production teams and into the fields to inspect and compare, and specifically and promptly solve problems in the movement. In particular, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of backward teams and low-yield areas, so that the backward catch up with the advanced, and low-yield becomes high-yield, and strive for comprehensive overproduction.
    The upsurge of the overproduction movement is rapidly forming
    The vast number of commune members in the province's people's communes enthusiastically responded to the Provincial Party Committee's call, and the overproduction competition movement quickly surged up in the recent half month. In the Shijiazhuang area, 80% of the production teams have seen the new atmosphere of "three highs and one more": high attendance rate, high labor efficiency, high quality of farm work, and more cadres participating in production. Gaocheng County, based on the ideas of some cadres and the masses who emphasize early autumn over late autumn, main grains over miscellaneous grains, and high-yield crops over low-yield crops, launched a "three catching up" competition of late autumn catching up with early autumn, miscellaneous grains catching up with main grains, and low-yield catching up with high-yield. The commune members of the Xing'an Production Team of the Xing'an Commune in this county stipulate that there will be an inspection, comparison, and reward every ten days. Now eight advanced production teams, twenty-two good cadres, and more than one hundred and twenty model commune members have emerged. Through commending the advanced, the advanced are more advanced, and the backward are catching up quickly. After the fifth and sixth production teams were recently rated as advanced teams, the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth production teams immediately convened a "Zhuge Liang meeting" to jointly discuss strategies to surpass the fifth and sixth production teams. Now the entire production team has set off a wave of teams striving to be upstream and everyone striving to be a model. After the Chengde area launched the competition of "learning from Banbishan, catching up with Banbishan, and surpassing Banbishan," the first comparison showed that two production teams surpassed the advanced banner Banbishan Production Team. The Chengde Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China analyzed the development trend of the movement and proposed to focus on remote areas, mountainous areas, and disaster areas, break through weak links, and overcome the phenomenon of uneven management of various crops in various regions. By the end of July, more than 5.97 million mu of spring seedlings and late fields in the entire area had been hoed two or three times, 5.3 billion jin of green manure had been pressed in more than twenty days, more than 3 million mu of crops had been topdressed, 450,000 mu of third-class seedlings had been upgraded, and more than 300,000 mu of disaster-stricken land had been replanted.
    Great victory has been achieved in the struggle against flood prevention and waterlogging

    The struggle for autumn harvest is even more intense in the Tangshan and Baoding areas, where there is more rainfall. From July 21st to 23rd, Tangshan suffered the first major rainstorm in ten years. The rainfall in the Luanhe and Jiyunhe river basins was generally between 200 and 300 millimeters, and the daily rainfall in some areas of Jixian, Qian'an, and Luanxian reached 500 millimeters. In early August, there were continuous heavy rains, and all rivers experienced extraordinarily large floods. The Jiyunhe flood peak flow reached 500 cubic meters per second, exceeding the guaranteed flow of 200 cubic meters per second. All rivers rose simultaneously, and the situation was very tense. The entire Party and the entire people in the Tangshan area were mobilized to fight the floods day and night. At critical moments, taking the initiative, Jixian County raised the Shaozhuangzi sluice gate on the left bank of the ditch and river to divert the flood into Qingdianwa, which greatly reduced the Jiyunhe water potential and ensured that more than 1 million mu of autumn fields were spared from flooding. Party and government cadres in Luanxian County dispatched all their personnel, concentrated their forces to defend the Wangjiafabao section of the right bank of the Luanhe River, and the entire Party and the entire people fought heroically and arduously, finally ensuring the safety of the dam and preventing the flood disaster from affecting most of the autumn fields in Luanxian County. The second focus of the rainstorm attack was the Baoding area. Since July 31, heavy rains have continuously fallen in the western mountainous areas. On August 3, in the 1,200 square kilometers area east of Daomaguan in Tangxian County, the rainfall was 100 to 200 millimeters in one instance. The rainfall in Renhou Town, the center of the rainstorm in Tangxian County, reached 417 millimeters. All large, medium, and small reservoirs in the rivers were full of floods, which exerted great power and reduced the flood peaks of the rivers. The counties downstream immediately launched a tense flood prevention battle when the river water rose sharply. After draining the water in some areas of Tangshan and Baoding that were hit by floods, they immediately roused their spirits and devoted themselves to the battle of replanting, rushing to plant, straightening fields, and washing seedlings, and the fallen crops were erected one by one. Their battle slogan is: "Fight hard and work hard, and strive to reduce production less in heavily affected areas, not reduce production in lightly affected areas, and strive for overproduction in non-disaster areas." Because of the heavy rainfall and damp soil in these two areas, weeds and seedlings grow together, and the fertility of the land is quickly lost. The phenomenon of fertilizer deficiency in crops after rain is serious. The Tangshan and Baoding Prefectural Committees of the Communist Party of China have proposed that weeding and weed removal, fertilizer accumulation and topdressing, and flood prevention and waterlogging combat are the main contents of the overproduction competition.
    Mutually promote and strengthen the late-stage management of autumn fields
    The eastern Tianjin area, located downstream of the rivers, has reduced the threat of water damage to the black, green, and robust crops because the heroic people in the upstream areas have carried out the great struggle of "splitting mountains, cutting rivers, subduing dragons, and locking jiaos". The enthusiasm of the masses is excited and encouraged. At present, while strictly guarding the dikes and stepping up precautions, they are making full use of favorable opportunities to carry out the overproduction competition movement. More than 2 million agricultural troops have launched an activity to increase production without weeds, pests, third-class seedlings, and idle land. In the competition movement, the various production teams learn advanced technologies from each other and compare labor efficiency and quality with each other. In Shicun Commune, Hejian County, weeding hoes and hoes are used to replace hand hoes, and one person and one animal can cultivate 15 mu per day, which is four times more efficient than manual labor. In the comparison, Wofotang Commune learned about it and quickly used this method to weed the weeds in 18,000 mu of autumn fields.
    The southern cotton-producing area, which has less rainfall, has paid special attention to the protection of cotton buds and bolls. Due to insufficient base fertilizer, 5 million mu of cotton in the Handan area generally shows a lack of fertilizer. The Handan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to the people of the entire region, urging them to seize the opportunity to strengthen field management while vigorously accumulating and making fertilizer and topdressing. The fertilizer accumulation army quickly expanded from 150,000 people to more than 500,000 people. The Haojiatun Production Team of the Chuiyang Commune in Nangong County cleared the old fertilizer accounts and adopted the method of paying commune members in cash based on the quality of the fertilizer, and the commune members were even more enthusiastic about accumulating fertilizer. 400 commune members accumulated more than 1.3 million jin of fertilizer in three days, which is equivalent to 50% of the amount of fertilizer accumulated during the entire wheat season. In the management of cotton fields, many communes have proposed the movement of "fiercely attacking and skillfully breaking through the three passes" and "firmly grasping the three generations of peaches". At present, the general cotton plants have two or three bolls, and about fifteen buds. On the whole, the situation of cotton production increase is also very favorable.

　　受灾地区人力胜天　无灾地区干劲冲天
　　农业战线秋季形势一片光明
　　河北防洪抗涝和田间管理两条战线一齐推进
    本报天津10日电　记者大昌报道：在河北省广阔的原野上，两千多万农业大军分作两条战线，以大无畏的气概向大自然夺取秋季大丰收。一条战线在从山区到平原沿各条大小河流的水库、堤坝上，一百二十六万防汛大军，日日夜夜向暴雨洪水紧张地搏斗。另一条战线是以秋田后期管理和积肥追肥为中心的规模壮阔的秋季全面超产运动。气候失调造成的困难难不倒燕赵英雄儿女，一些对增产不利的因素已经或者正在被克服；整个说来，农业战线的形势一片光明，新的生产高潮正在形成。抓紧“定年景、定收成”的紧要时机
    河北省今年入夏以来，前期雨水调顺，各种大秋作物生长得比往年都好。但是从7月下半月开始，连续在小面积、短时间内集中倾降暴雨，唐山、保定等部分地区发生洪水，大好庄稼局部遭到损害。目前雨季未过，正是“定年景、定收成”的紧要关头。中共河北省委分析了当前形势，指示各级党委都要划分战线加强领导，书记挂帅，干部到田间，更进一步把超产竞赛运动引向深入，大战8、9两月，夺取全面大丰收。省委指出：当前主要斗争方向是防洪防涝、增施追肥、灭草荒和灭虫害。为了胜利地开展夺秋大战，第一、必须继续发动全党全民开展大讨论，认清有利形势，克服某些干部的右倾保守和畏难泄气情绪，继续鼓足干劲，乘胜前进，夺取全面丰收；第二、包工包产落实必须全部到队，目前还有30％以上的队包产没有落实，必须通过群众讨论作到队队包产落实，制定超产计划，鼓起社员群众的超产热情；第三、进一步改善劳动管理，提高劳动效率，主要是因地制宜推行各种责任制；第四、调整各级党委书记的分工，划分领导战线，不仅粮、棉、油料有专管书记，农、林、牧、副、渔都要同时有专人管。领导干部要深入小队，深入田间，检查评比，具体及时地解决运动中的问题。特别要加强对落后队、低产区的领导，使落后赶上先进，低产变成高产，争取全面超产。
    超产运动的高潮迅速形成
    全省各人民公社的广大社员，热烈响应省委的号召，超产竞赛运动在最近半个月的时间里很快地涌起高潮。石家庄地区已有80％的生产队出现了出勤率高、劳动效率高、农活质量高和干部参加生产多的“三高一多”新气象。藁城县根据部分干部和群众重早秋轻晚秋、重主粮轻杂粮、重高产作物轻低产作物等思想，展开了晚秋赶早秋、杂粮赶主粮，低产赶高产的“三赶”竞赛。这个县的兴安公社兴安生产队的社员们，规定十天一检查、评比、奖励，现在已涌现出八个先进生产小队，二十二个好干部和一百二十多名模范社员。通过表彰先进，先进的更先进，落后的急起直追，第五、六两小队最近一次被评为先进队后，十五、十六、十七三个小队马上召开了“诸葛亮会”共谋超过五、六小队的良策，现在整个生产队掀起了队队争上游、人人争模范的浪潮。承德地区在掀起“学半壁山、赶半壁山、超半壁山”的竞赛后，第一次评比，就有两个生产队超过了先进旗帜半壁山生产队。中共承德地委分析了运动发展的形势，提出狠抓边远地区、山区和灾区，突破薄弱环节，克服各地区各种作物在管理上畸轻畸重的现象。到7月底，全区五百九十七万多亩春苗、晚田已普锄二、三遍，二十多天内压绿肥五十三亿斤，三百多万亩庄稼施了追肥，有四十五万亩三类苗升了级，三十多万亩受灾土地进行了抢种补种。
  防洪抗涝斗争取得巨大胜利
    雨水较多的唐山、保定地区，夺秋战更加激烈。7月21日到23日唐山遭到十年来第一次特大暴雨，泺河、蓟运河流域雨量一般在二百到三百毫米，蓟县、迁安、泺县部分地区一日雨量达到五百毫米。8月初又连降暴雨，各河都出现特大洪峰，蓟运河洪峰流量达五百秒公方，超过保证流量二百秒公方。各河一齐涨水，局势十分紧张。唐山地区全党全民总动员，向洪水日夜搏斗。在危急时机，争取主动，蓟县将沟河左堤邵庄子闸提开，分洪入青甸洼，大大消减了蓟运河水势，保证了一百多万亩秋田免遭水灾。泺县党政干部全体出动，集中兵力坚守泺河右岸王家法宝段大堤，全党全民英勇苦战，终于保证了大堤的安全，免除泺县大半部秋田的洪水灾害。暴雨第二个袭击重点是保定地区。7月31日以来，西部山区连降暴雨，8月3日唐县倒马关以东一千二百平方公里的地区，一次降雨量一百至二百毫米，暴雨中心唐县仁厚镇雨量达四百一十七毫米。各河大、中、小水库都蓄满了洪水，发挥了很大威力，减弱了各河洪峰。下游各县在河水猛涨时立即投入紧张的防汛战斗。唐山、保定遭受水灾的部分地区，排水退水以后，立即鼓起干劲投入补种、抢种、整田、洗苗战斗，倒伏了的庄稼一棵棵扶起来。他们的战斗口号是：“苦战苦干，力争重灾区少减产，轻灾区不减产，非灾区争超产”。这两个地区由于雨多地湿，草苗齐长，地里肥分流失很快，庄稼雨后缺肥现象严重。唐山、保定地委都提出以锄草灭荒、积肥追肥、防洪防涝为超产竞赛的主要内容。
  互相促进加强秋田后期管理
    位居各河下游的东部天津地区，由于各上游地区的英雄人民进行了“劈山斩河，降龙锁蛟”的伟大斗争，河水平稳下泄，黑绿粗壮的庄稼减少了水害威胁。群众情绪兴奋鼓舞，目前正一方面严守堤防，加紧戒备，一方面充分利用有利时机，开展超产竞赛运动。二百多万农业大军，展开无草荒、无虫害、无三类苗、无闲散地的增产活动。在竞赛运动中，各个生产队互学先进技术，互比劳动效率和质量。河间县时村公社中耕用耘锄和耠子代替手锄，一人一畜每天中耕十五亩，比人力提高效率四倍；在评比中，卧佛堂公社知道了，很快就也用这方法把一万八千亩秋田的杂草锄净了。
    雨水较小的南部产棉区，特别注意了棉花的保蕾保铃。邯郸地区五百万亩棉花因底肥不足，目前普遍呈现缺肥现象。中共邯郸地委向全区人民发出号召，要抓紧时机在加强田间管理的同时，大力积肥造肥追肥。积肥大军迅速由十五万人扩大到五十多万人。南宫县垂杨公社郝家屯生产队清理了旧肥账，采取了肥料以质论价付给社员现款的办法，社员积肥劲头更大，四百名社员三天积肥一百三十多万斤，相当整个麦季积肥数的50％。在棉田管理上，许多公社提出“猛攻巧闯三道关”和“狠抓三辈桃”的运动。现在一般棉株已座铃两三个，现蕾十五个左右。总的看来，棉花增产的形势也是十分有利的。
