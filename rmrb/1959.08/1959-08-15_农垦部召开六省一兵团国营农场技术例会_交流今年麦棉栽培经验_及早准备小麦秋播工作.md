Xinhua News Agency report: The Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation recently held a technical meeting at the Huangfan District Farm in Henan Province, attended by representatives from state farms in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Hubei provinces, as well as the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, to discuss wheat and cotton cultivation techniques.

The meeting summarized and exchanged experiences in wheat and cotton cultivation on state farms in 1959, discussed wheat cultivation techniques for 1960, and made specific arrangements for the current late-stage management of cotton fields. The attending representatives unanimously expressed their determination to exert great effort, continue to comprehensively implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," increase yields, reduce costs, and strive for even greater increases in wheat production next year and cotton production this year.

This year, the wheat planting area of state farms in these regions increased by 31% compared to last year, the unit area yield increased by 11.5%, and the total output increased by 47%. Furthermore, many large-scale high-yield fields have emerged. The meeting believes that these achievements are the result of the great enthusiasm of farm workers under the impetus of the Great Leap Forward, the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," and the full utilization of the advantages of mechanized production on state farms. The meeting required all state farms to conscientiously prepare for the 1960 wheat sowing, strive for a greater wheat harvest next year. Regarding wheat cultivation techniques, it was generally agreed that: in terms of deep plowing, it is generally advisable to plow to a depth of around 30 centimeters, depending on the soil and machinery conditions of each state farm. According to soil fertility and fertilization levels, each area should determine an appropriate planting density, generally aiming for 250,000 to 350,000 seedlings per mu. At the same time, it is necessary to improve fertilizer quality, pay attention to fertilization techniques, and fully utilize fertilizer effectiveness. To ensure increased production, the meeting also required all state farms to establish a graded seed breeding system, strengthen the breeding of fine varieties, and continuously improve seed quality; methods for implementing measures such as water, conservation, construction, and management were also studied.

This year, the cotton growth of state farms in various regions is good. They have now entered the peak flowering period, and many early cotton bolls have already set. They are now intensively strengthening the late-stage management of cotton fields, consolidating the early bolls, and striving to set more autumn bolls, striving for a greater cotton harvest this year.

　　农垦部召开六省一兵团国营农场技术例会
　　交流今年麦棉栽培经验
　　及早准备小麦秋播工作
    据新华社讯  中央农垦部最近在河南黄泛区农场召开了有河南、河北、山东、安徽、江苏、湖北六省和新疆生产建设兵团所属国营农场的代表参加的小麦、棉花栽培技术例会。
    这次会议总结交流了国营农场1959年小麦、棉花的栽培经验，讨论了1960年小麦栽培技术问题，具体安排了当前棉田的后期管理工作，到会代表一致表示要鼓足干劲，继续全面贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，提高产量，降低成本，争取明年小麦和今年棉花的更大增产。
    今年，这些地区国营农场的小麦种植面积比去年扩大了31％，单位面积产量提高11.5％，总产量增加47％，并且出现了许多大面积丰产田。会议认为，这些成绩是在大跃进形势的推动下，农场职工群众干劲大，全面贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”和充分发挥国营农场机械化生产优越条件的结果。会议要求各国营农场要踏踏实实地做好1960年小麦播种准备工作，争取明年小麦更大丰收，关于小麦栽培技术问题，大家认为：深耕方面，根据各国营农场土壤和机具条件，一般以深耕三十厘米上下为宜。根据土壤肥力和施肥水平，各地要确定适宜的密植程度，一般以每亩保苗二十五万至三十五万株为宜。同时要提高肥料质量，注意施肥技术，充分发挥肥效。为了保证增产，会议还要求各国营农场建立等级留种田制度，加强良种繁育，不断提高种子质量；对水、保、工、管等措施也研究了贯彻执行的办法。
    今年各地国营农场棉花生长情况良好，目前已经进入开花盛期，已经座住不少伏桃；现在正在紧张地加强棉田后期管理，巩固伏桃，争取多座秋桃，力争今年棉花更大丰收。
