　　Northern Rice Should Soar Alongside Southern Rice
　　Liaoning Farmers Seize the Great Opportunity to Weed, Topdress, Drain, and Sun-Dry Rice Fields
　　Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture Strengthens Rice Field Management to Strive for Increased Production

　　(Our newspaper, Shenyang, 11th) Rural areas throughout Liaoning Province are strengthening rice field management link by link, with work being better and more meticulous than in any previous year. The province's three million mu of rice fields are lush green, and the rice is growing well. Early-transplanted seedlings have reached two to three feet in height, and are universally heading, flowering, and pollinating, with uniform and large ears, promising a bumper harvest.

　　The area of paddy fields in Liaoning Province has been continuously expanding in recent years. In 1958, it increased by nearly two and a half times compared to before 1955. However, in the past, some regions did not develop paddy fields in accordance with local conditions, resulting in some land not only failing to produce more grain than dry land, but in some cases even producing less. In view of this situation, this year the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee emphasized expanding rice cultivation in accordance with local conditions, demanding that for every mu planted, there should be an increase in production, and that no land should be wasted. On the one hand, it required that land suitable for opening up paddy fields should be converted into paddy fields; on the other hand, it pointed out that paddy fields unsuitable for rice cultivation could be converted into dry land. In this way, although the area of paddy fields has decreased somewhat, it is expected that the total rice output can still reach last year's level by vigorously increasing the yield per unit area of existing paddy fields.

　　In order to achieve this requirement, various localities are striving to increase yields per mu. This year, from the very first step, they have tightly grasped the key to increasing rice production in the north—transplanting seedlings early. In the north, due to climatic conditions, the timing of transplanting has a significant impact on yield. In the past, seedlings were cultivated at the end of April, and transplanting did not begin until early June, with the end period dragging on until the end of June or the beginning of July every year. As a result, some rice had insufficient temperature in the later stages, resulting in a lot of green rice and shriveled grains after autumn, and the grains were generally not full enough, resulting in low yields. This year, all parts of the province have universally promoted the method of raising seedlings under oiled paper in Xinbin County, using artificial control of temperature, and the time for raising seedlings and transplanting has been advanced by more than half a month compared to previous years. After transplanting began, the province and various counties held rice transplanting competitions, and by learning the transplanting method of Sun Xiuying, a transplanting expert from Yingkou Shuiyuan Commune, transplanting techniques were greatly improved, and the end of the transplanting period was advanced by more than ten days compared to previous years.

　　After finishing transplanting, various localities have tightly grasped another key link to increasing rice production—field management. This year, the characteristics of rice field management throughout the province are that everyone started early, acted quickly, and took concrete, in-depth, and meticulous measures. Many regions have taken timely weeding and topdressing measures to promote vigorous rice growth. Andong County rationally organized the labor force, established two fronts for paddy and dry land, and mobilized more than 60,000 people every day to carry out a concentrated attack on weeding and applying manure fertilizer to rice. Some communes, based on the principle of equivalent exchange, launched large-scale cooperation between teams, concentrating their efforts to strengthen rice field management. Some regions, in the case of insufficient chemical fertilizers, found ways to tap manure sources and applied a large amount of human waste. Shuiyuan Commune in Yingkou County weeded and topdressed at the same time, and now most of the rice in the commune has been fertilized twice. This year, rice blast disease has also been very serious in many areas, and various localities have taken timely prevention and control measures after discovering the disease. After discovering rice blast disease, Qianyang Commune in Andong County mobilized more than 100 sprayers to spray medicine, and quickly controlled the spread of rice blast disease. In order to support farmers in overcoming pests and diseases, a certain unit of the Air Force stationed in the Shenyang area dispatched thirty-three sorties of aircraft to help eliminate pests and diseases.

　　At present, in addition to continuing weeding and topdressing in rice field management, farmers in various parts of Liaoning Province are vigorously draining and sun-drying the fields to promote early maturity of crops. This year, the advanced measure of draining and sun-drying fields has been promoted more universally than in any previous year. Counties such as Kuandian and Huanren have also adopted the method of draining water during the day and irrigating at night according to the climate characteristics. In this way, the fields can be sun-dried during the day and kept warm at night, which is very beneficial to promoting the growth of rice.

　　(Our newspaper, Changchun, 13th) The famous Northeast rice-producing area—Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province—has universally good rice growth on the 690,000 mu of rice planted this year. In the fields, a vivid scene of a promising harvest encourages farmers of all ethnic groups to strengthen late-stage field management and vow to win a comprehensive bumper harvest.

　　This year, all the rice fields planted in Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture have been deeply plowed, and an average of more than 26,000 jin of base fertilizer has been applied per mu, an increase of about one-third compared to the past; advanced seedling raising methods have been implemented, and seedlings have been transplanted in a timely manner, finishing the transplanting work more than ten days earlier than in previous years; reasonable close planting has been implemented, and the number of plants is generally about 30% higher than in the past. Field management has also been greatly strengthened, with two rounds of weeding generally carried out, and some areas even weeding three times. Fertilizer has generally been applied once to the fields, and the experimental fields have been fertilized two to three times. The average number of field management measures has been increased by half to one round compared to last year.

　　At present, the general characteristics of rice growth in the entire prefecture are: a large number of plants, dense clusters; thick stalks and luxuriant leaves, a lush green scene. Rice in general fields has grown to about one meter, and rice in experimental fields is all above one meter. People can hardly see the figures of people weeding in the fields on both sides of the canals. Most of the rice has already flowered and is filling, and the rest is heading and earing.

　　In order to strive for a greater harvest, the Yanbian Prefecture Party Committee of the Communist Party of China is seizing the current great opportunity to mobilize farmers of all ethnic groups to carry out a mass movement to exceed contracted production. The characteristics of this movement are that the leadership is grasping tightly, the masses are acting quickly, and all localities are accelerating the flowering and grain filling of rice by applying fertilizer and weeding. Under the slogan of "Adding more measures to increase production by another 100 jin per 1000 jin," the Tongfo People's Commune in Yanji County re-weeded 1,500 mu of rice while also applying another round of plant ash. After the Helong County Party Committee put forward the requirements of "passing three passes" (weeding, topdressing, irrigation) and "three defenses" (pests and diseases, greedy green lodging, wind disaster), each commune generally inspected the rice fields and strengthened late-stage management by adopting measures to make up for what was lacking. The Mingxing Management Area of the Toudao People's Commune applied more than 12,000 jin of plant ash in two days; the Tushan People's Commune mobilized more than 1,800 laborers every day to remove more than 45,000 meters of weeds growing on both sides of the ditches. Since the launch of the movement to exceed quotas and exceed contracted production, 80% of the commune members in Machuanzi People's Commune in Hunchun County have exceeded their quotas, and all the rice fields have been weeded twice. Since this commune transferred more than 750 laborers to form a specialized team for field management, and after adding measures and skillfully managing, the proportion of third-class seedlings has been reduced from the original 15% to 3%, and the proportion of first-class seedlings has increased to more than 95%.

　　When strengthening late-stage field management, various localities have tightly grasped the important production-increasing measure of raising water temperature. The Xinfeng Management Area of the Changbai People's Commune in Yanji City divided more than 3,800 mu of rice fields into two categories: one category of fields was drained and sun-dried, and the second category of fields was shallowly irrigated with about one inch of water, so that the water temperature of the rice fields was universally increased by five or six degrees.

    北方水稻要同南方水稻比翼高飞
　　辽宁农民趁大好时机给水稻除草追肥排水晒田
　　延边朝鲜族自治州加强稻田管理全力争取超产
    本报沈阳11日电　辽宁省各地农村一环扣一环地加强水稻田间管理，工作比以往任何一年都好都细致。全省三百万亩水稻片片葱绿，生长良好。早期插的秧稻秸已达二、三尺高，普遍抽穗开花授粉，穗齐、穗大，丰收在望。
    辽宁省的水田面积几年来不断扩大。1958年比1955年以前增加了将近两倍半。但是，过去由于有些地区没有因地制宜地开发水田，结果有些地因为水源不足，不仅不能比旱田多打粮，有的甚至还不如旱田打粮多。根据这种情况，今年辽宁省委强调因地制宜地扩种水稻，要求种一亩，增产一亩，决不浪费土地。一面要求把适合开辟水田的土地开成水田；一面指出那些不能种水稻的水田，可以改成旱田。这样，虽然水田面积减少了一些，但是通过大力提高现有水田单位面积产量，预计水稻总产量仍可达到去年的水平。
    各地为了实现这个要求，力争提高单产。今年从第一步开始，就紧紧抓住了北方水稻增产关键——提前插秧。在北方，由于气候条件的关系，插秧早晚对产量影响甚大。往年，这里4月末育苗，6月初才开始插秧，结束期每年都拖到6月末7月初。这样，有些水稻因后期温度不够，秋后青米、瘪粒很多，一般籽粒也不够饱满，产量不高。今年全省各地普遍推广新宾县油纸育苗的方法，利用人工控制温度，育苗和插秧时间都比往年提早了半个多月。在插秧开始以后，全省和各县又召开水稻插秧比武大会，通过学习营口水源公社插秧能手孙秀英的插秧方法，插秧技术大大熟练了，结束插秧期比往年提早了十多天。
    各地在结束插秧以后，又紧紧抓住了水稻增产的另一个环节——田间管理。今年全省水稻田间管理的特点是普遍动手早、行动快、措施具体、深入、细致。许多地区为了促使水稻旺盛生长，都做到及时除草、追肥。安东县合理组织劳动力，建立水旱田两条战线，每天有六万多人突击水稻除草和给水稻追施粪肥。有些公社根据等价交换的原则，展开了队与队之间大协作，集中力量加强了水稻田间管理。有些地区在化学肥料不足的情况下，想办法挖掘粪源，追施了大量人粪尿。营口县水源公社一边拔草一边追肥，现在全社大部分水稻都追了两次肥料。今年，不少地区的稻瘟病也很严重，各地在发现病害后都及时进行防治。安东县前阳公社发现稻瘟病以后，集中一百多台喷雾器喷药，很短时间就控制了稻瘟病的蔓延。为了支援农民战胜病虫灾害，驻沈阳地区空军某部先后出动了三十三架次飞机，帮助消灭病虫害。
    目前，辽宁省各地农民在水稻田间管理方面除继续拔草、追肥以外，正在大力排水晒田，促进作物早熟。今年，排水晒田这一先进措施，推广得比哪年都普遍。宽甸、桓仁等县根据气候特点，还采取了白天排水、晚上灌水的方法。这样，白天既能晒田，晚上又能保温，对促进稻禾生长好处很大。
    本报长春13日电　著名的东北水稻产区——吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州，今年播种的六十九万亩水稻普遍生长良好。田野里，一片丰收在望的生动景象，鼓舞着各族农民加强后期田间管理，誓夺全面丰收。
    今年，延边朝鲜族自治州种植的稻田全部经过深翻，每亩平均施底肥二万六千多斤，比过去增加三分之一左右；推行了先进育苗法，适时早插秧，比往年提前十多天结束了插秧工作；实行了合理密植，株数一般都比过去增加30％左右。在田间管理上也大大加强，普遍拔了两遍草，其中还有一部分拔了三次草，一般田都追了一遍肥，试验田追了二到三遍，各项田间管理措施平均比去年多加半遍到一遍工。
    目前全州水稻生长总的特点是：株数多、簇距密；秆粗叶茂，一片青葱碧绿。一般田的水稻已长到一米左右，试验田水稻都在一米以上。人们在渠道两旁已经很难看见田里拔草的人影。大部分水稻已经扬花灌浆，其余的也都正在拔节抽穗。
    为了争取更大丰收，中共延边州委正在抓紧当前大好时机，发动各族农民开展群众性的超包产运动。这个运动的特点是，领导抓的紧、群众行动快、各地都正在追肥、拔草加速水稻扬花灌浆。延吉县铜佛人民公社在“措施加码，每千斤再增产一百斤”的口号下，再薅一遍草的同时，把一千五百亩水稻又追了一遍草木灰。和龙县委提出“过三关”（除草、追肥、灌水）“三防”（病虫害、贪青倒伏、风灾）的要求后，各公社普遍检查了一次稻田，采取缺啥补啥的办法，加强了后期管理。头道人民公社明星管理区两天追了一万二千多斤草木灰；土山人民公社每天出动一千八百多名劳力，铲除了四万五千多米长在水沟两旁的杂草。珲春县马川子人民公社自开展超定额、超包产运动以来，80％的社员超过了定额，全部水田已薅草两遍。这个公社由于抽调七百五十多劳力组成田间管理专业队，加措施巧管理以后，三类苗已由原来的15％减少到3％，一类苗上升到95％以上。
    在加强后期田间管理的时候，各地紧紧抓住了提高水温这项重要增产措施。延吉市长白人民公社新丰管理区，将三千八百多亩水田分为两类，一类田排水晒田，二类田浅灌水一寸左右，使稻田水温普遍提高五、六度。　　　（郝玉田）
