    Accelerating the Development of Tropical Resources in Hainan Island
    Lin Liming, Secretary of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee and First Secretary of the Hainan District Party Committee
    Hainan Island is the treasure island of our motherland, a pearl in the South China Sea. Located in the tropics, with a mild climate and abundant rainfall, it is suitable for large-scale cultivation of tropical cash crops, making it a rare tropical region in our country. Fully utilizing Hainan's unique conditions to develop the production of tropical crops such as oil palm, coconut, sisal hemp, Sea Island cotton, coffee, and pepper is of great significance for supplying our country with important industrial raw materials and necessities for people's lives, making greater contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland, developing Hainan Island's economy, and increasing the income of the masses.
    Moreover, Hainan Island's other resources are also extremely rich. It has abundant mineral deposits, including valuable non-ferrous metals. The famous Shilu Iron Mine contains 400 million tons of ore with an iron content of 60%; it has vast primeval tropical forests, producing valuable tropical timber; it has abundant water resources, with the three major rivers of Nandu River, Wanquan River, and Changhua River alone having an installed capacity of 500,000 kilowatts; and it has the Yinggehai Salt Field, whose seawater concentration is comparable to the world's saltiest ocean, the Red Sea. Recently, rich deposits of lignite and oil shale, which had not been discovered before, have also been found, providing favorable conditions for establishing heavy industry and chemical industry. At the same time, it has more than 1,400 kilometers of coastline and more than 60 large and small bays, with broad marine aquaculture farms and offshore and deep-sea fishing grounds; it also has vast plains, lush vegetation, and perpetual verdure, which can be used to develop tropical and subtropical aquaculture and animal husbandry.
    Developing Hainan's tropical resources is a policy that the CPC Central Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Committee have long established. In the past few years, under the leadership and support of the Central Committee and the Provincial Committee, many state-owned farms have been established on Hainan Island, and tropical crops have been well developed. However, many difficulties were encountered in the past in developing tropical crops, mainly the inability to achieve self-sufficiency in grain. In the eight years from liberation to 1957, grain production increased significantly, but every year it was still necessary to transfer about 100 million jin of grain from other areas. After years of research and exploration, we believe that from the perspective of long-term production policy, Hainan should focus on the development of tropical cash crops, and in order to better implement this policy, it is necessary to first solve the grain problem. Therefore, since liberation, the whole Party and the whole people have concentrated their efforts on grain production. Until 1958, under the situation of the Great Leap Forward nationwide, after a year of hard work by the whole Party and the whole people, the grain situation changed significantly, with total grain output increasing by 50% over the previous year, basically achieving self-sufficiency in grain. Other difficulties encountered in the past in developing tropical crops were: insufficient seedlings, inconvenient transportation, and lack of production technology and experience, etc., which have now been basically resolved. Labor shortages and poor water conservancy and irrigation are also being gradually resolved. In this way, the necessary conditions have been created for accelerating the development of Hainan. In view of the needs of the country and the conditions of Hainan itself, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Committee, the District Party Committee resolutely implements the policy of developing Hainan with the development of tropical crops as the main focus. At present, grain and tropical crops are developed simultaneously. Based on this policy, a preliminary plan for the development of Hainan has been formulated.
    The development of Hainan is an integral part of our country's magnificent plan for socialist construction. According to preliminary survey data, Hainan has more than 22 million mu of land suitable for planting tropical cash crops. We plan to reclaim more than half of it during the Second Five-Year Plan period, and basically complete the reclamation of the rest during the Third Five-Year Plan period. If all the tropical crops planted during the Second Five-Year Plan period are harvested, the annual output value will reach 5 billion yuan based on a more cautious estimate. If calculated on the average labor force required, each person can create an output value of 8,000 to 10,000 yuan for the country.
    In order to implement the Central Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Committee's policy on developing Hainan, accelerate socialist construction, and successfully complete the glorious tasks assigned to the Hainan Party organizations and the people of the whole island by the higher-level Party, we are taking the following measures to realize the development plan for tropical crops:
    (1) In order to further facilitate the development of tropical crops and to ensure sufficient feed for animal husbandry, it is still necessary to emphasize grasping grain production. It should be recognized that although grain crops have achieved a bumper harvest last year, it cannot be said to be abundant. In order to make grain production solid and lay a solid foundation, grain production must not be relaxed. At present, we should implement the principle of taking grain production as the center, realizing the simultaneous development of grain and tropical crops, grasping grain production while doing a good job in planting tropical crops. In the future, when grain is self-sufficient and there is ample feed and a certain reserve, more efforts will be concentrated on developing tropical crops.
    (2) The whole Party and the whole people should engage in tropical crops on a large scale, so that tropical crops are planted all over the island. State-owned farms are the focus and main reliance for developing tropical crops. People's communes should also engage in tropical crops on a large scale. Using both legs to walk can accelerate the completion of this important task. Now, the communes are giving full play to their superiority, implementing unified leadership and hierarchical management, giving full play to the enthusiasm of production brigades and production teams, organizing professional teams, and making overall plans, which will soon set off a high tide of developing tropical crops.
    (3) The full development and utilization of Hainan's vast wasteland and the rapid growth and high yield of tropical crops should be closely combined. At present, the land already utilized in Hainan has not reached one-tenth of the land that can be planted with tropical crops, and this land is rare and valuable, so planting should be developed on a large scale; at the same time, it should also be seen that the potential of the unit area yield of tropical crops is very large, and a basic farmland system should be established, deep plowing and meticulous cultivation should be implemented, and the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture should be fully implemented to achieve the requirements of rapid growth and high yield.
    (4) Vigorously carrying out tool reform and gradually realizing mechanization and electrification is an important measure to accelerate the development of Hainan. Hainan is extremely short of labor, so it is necessary to vigorously carry out technical revolution, carry out tool reform, carry out high work efficiency campaigns, and carry it out as a mass and sustained movement; at the same time, small and medium-sized power generation should be vigorously carried out, and the three major hydropower stations of Songtao, Jiadao, and Jiaxingling should be accelerated to form Hainan's power grid, and electrification and mechanization should be realized as soon as possible, and an island railway and ports and wharves should be built.
    (5) The key to implementing the Hainan development policy and plan lies in strengthening the leadership of the Party Committee. In addition to establishing two fronts of industry and agriculture, Party Committees at all levels above the commune should also establish a tropical crop front and set up effective administrative agencies; in places where conditions permit, the focus of leadership should be shifted to tropical crop production. Secondly, labor should be properly and rationally arranged to form a professional team to manage tropical crops, and the completion of the development plan should be effectively guaranteed.
    We firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Committee, and with the support of the people of the whole country, the Party organizations and the entire people of Hainan Island will continue to work hard, exert full effort, and combine hard work and practical work with clever work, and will certainly achieve great results this year, and will certainly build Hainan into an island of tropical crops in one or two five-year plans!

    加速开发海南岛的热带资源
    中共广东省委书记兼海南区党委第一书记　林李明
    海南岛，是祖国的宝岛，南海上的明珠。这里，地处热带，气候温和，雨量充沛，适宜于大量种植热带经济作物，是我们祖国极其少有的热带地区。充分利用海南得天独厚的条件，发展油棕、椰子、剑麻、海岛棉、咖啡、胡椒等热带作物生产，对于供应我国的重要工业原料和人民生活的必需品，为祖国社会主义建设作出更大的贡献，对于发展海南岛的经济和增加群众的收入，都有重大的意义。
    不但如此，海南岛的其他资源也是极丰富的。这里有丰富的矿藏，有贵重的有色金属，著名的石碌铁矿蕴藏着含铁量达60％的矿石四亿吨；有广阔的原始热带森林，盛产贵重的热带林木；有丰富的水利资源，仅就南渡江、万泉河、昌化江三大河流，装机容量可达五十万瓩；还有海水浓度能与世界最咸的海洋红海相媲美的莺歌海盐场，最近，还发现一向没有被发现的丰富的褐煤和油页岩，这就为建立重工业、化学工业提供有利的条件。同时，这里有一千四百余公里的海岸线和六十余个大小港湾，有着宽广的海水养殖场和近海、远洋渔场；也有辽阔的原野，植物繁茂，终年不雕，可以发展热带、亚热带的水产和畜牧业。
    开发海南热带资源是中共中央、广东省委早已确定的方针。过去几年，在中央、省委的领导和支持下，海南岛建立了许多国营农场，热带作物有了良好的发展。但是，过去在发展热带作物中遇到许多困难，主要是粮食不能自给。解放后到1957年的八年中，粮食产量有显著的增长，但是每年仍要从外区调进一亿斤上下的粮食。我们经过多年来的研究探索，认为从长远的生产方针来考虑，海南应以发展热带经济作物为主，而为了更好地执行这个方针，又必须首先解决粮食问题。因此，解放以来，全党全民集中精力抓粮食生产。直到1958年，在全国大跃进的形势下，经过全党全民苦战一年，粮食形势起了显著的变化，全年粮食总产量比上一年度增产50％，粮食基本实现自给。过去在发展热带作物中遇到的其他困难是：种苗不够、交通不便、生产技术经验不足，等等，现在已基本上获得解决，劳动力不足、水利灌溉差等，目前也正在陆续解决。这样，就为加速开发海南创造了必要的条件。鉴于国家的需要和海南本身具备的条件，遵照党中央和广东省委的指示，区党委坚决执行开发海南的方针是以发展热带作物为主。目前则以粮食和热带作物并举。并根据这一方针，制定了开发海南的初步规划。
    开发海南是我国社会主义建设宏伟计划的组成部分。根据初步勘察资料，海南有二千二百万亩以上土地适宜种植热带经济作物，我们计划在第二个五年计划期内开垦一半以上，其余在第三个五年计划期内基本上开垦完。如果第二个五年计划期间定植的热带作物全部收获，按较慎重的估算，每年产值将达五十亿元，如按所需的劳动力平均计算，每人可为国家创造八千到一万元的产值。
    为了贯彻执行中央和广东省委关于开发海南的方针，加速社会主义建设，胜利完成上级党交给海南党组织和全岛人民的光荣任务，我们正在采取下列措施来实现热带作物的发展规划：
      （一）为了更有利于发展热带作物，和使畜牧业获得充足的饲料，仍须强调抓粮食生产。应该认识，去年粮食作物虽已获得大丰收，但仍不能说是宽裕的。为了要使粮食生产搞得扎扎实实和打下雄厚的基础，绝不能放松粮食生产。当前应执行以粮食生产为中心，实现粮食和热带作物同时并举，既要抓紧粮食生产又要做好热带作物的种植，今后即在粮食自给并有充裕的饲料和一定的储备的情况下，集中更多的力量发展热带作物。
      （二）全党全民大搞热带作物，使热带作物遍种全岛。国营农场是发展热带作物的重点和主要依靠，人民公社也要大搞热带作物，用两条腿走路，才能加速完成这一重任。现在各公社正发挥它的优越性，实行统一领导、分级管理，充分发挥生产大队、生产队的积极性，组织专业队伍，全面规划，即将掀起发展热带作物的高潮。
      （三）把充分开发利用海南大片荒地和热带作物的速生高产密切结合起来。目前海南已利用的土地还未达到能种热带作物的土地的十分之一，而这些土地是罕少可贵的，所以应该大量发展种植；同时也应看到，热带作物的单位面积产量潜力很大，应建立基本农田制，实行深耕细作，全面贯彻农业八字宪法，达到速生高产的要求。
    （四）大力进行工具改革，逐步实现机械化、电气化，是加速开发海南的重要措施。海南劳动力非常缺乏，必须大闹技术革命，进行工具改革，开展高工效运动，并把它作为群众性、持久性的运动开展下去；与此同时，应大力搞中小型发电，加速把松涛、佳叨、加兴岭三大水电站建成，组成海南的电力网，尽早实现电气化、机械化，并建成环岛铁路和港口、码头。
    （五）贯彻执行海南开发方针和计划的关键，在于加强党委的领导。公社以上各级党委除应建立工农两条战线外，还应建立热带作物战线，成立有力的办事机构；在具备条件的地方，领导的重点应该转移到热带作物生产方面来。其次，要妥善合理地安排劳动力，组成经营热带作物的专业队伍，切实保证发展规划的完成。
    我们坚信，在党中央和省委的正确领导下，在全国人民的支持下，海南岛各级党的组织和全体人民将继续苦战，鼓足干劲，把苦干实干和巧干结合起来，一定可以在今年获得巨大成绩，一定可以在一两个五年计划内把海南建设成为热带作物之岛！
