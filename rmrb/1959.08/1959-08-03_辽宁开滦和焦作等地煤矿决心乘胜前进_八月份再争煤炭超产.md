Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 2nd: Workers at the four major state-owned coal mines in Liaoning Province—Fushun, Fuxin, Benxi, and Beipiao—are advancing vigorously, determined to comprehensively exceed the coal production plan for August.

These four major coal mines already overfulfilled the entire month's coal production plan in July, with coal output increasing by 400,000 tons compared to June; the coal production level rose steadily each ten-day period. Currently, the workers are highly motivated, setting off a new high tide of coal production increase; at the same time, the mines have strengthened tunneling work, preparing sufficient coal reserves for August. The thirty-six advanced experiences stipulated by the Ministry of Coal Industry have been promoted in most coal mines, becoming an important factor in increasing coal production. From the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, the Municipal Party Committees of each city, to the Party Committees of the mining areas, all have strengthened specific leadership over the coal mines. Many mines have improved and established various responsibility systems, strengthening production management. These factors are promoting a deeper development of the large-scale coal abundance movement.

On July 30th and 31st, the Liaoning Provincial Coal Bureau once again specifically arranged the production tasks for August, especially the first ten days of August. Each mine also summarized the experiences of units that had completed their tasks outstandingly and examined the reasons why some units had not completed their tasks well, mobilizing miners to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced. The Liaoning Provincial Coal Bureau also made unified and specific arrangements for the equipment maintenance work of the large mines under its jurisdiction with daily outputs of ten thousand tons and seven to eight thousand tons of coal, avoiding the shortcomings of several mines undergoing maintenance simultaneously and affecting production in the past, ensuring that the production level in August can steadily increase. A large number of ball bearings and various steel materials supporting coal mines from factories and mines in Shenyang, Dalian, Dandong, Yingkou, and other places are being sent to the coal mines in urgent need of these materials for the maintenance of electromechanical equipment. In the last two days, all four major coal mines have called the Liaoning Provincial Coal Bureau, expressing their determination to overfulfill the production plan for the first ten days of August.

Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, August 2nd: Kailuan Coal Mine continues to deeply mobilize the masses to carry out competitions around large-scale abundance, ensuring that the coal production plan for August is overfulfilled ahead of schedule.

In the first half of this year, the workers of Kailuan Coal Mine overfulfilled the raw coal production plan. In early July, this coal mine, along with Jingsi, Fushun, Fuxin, Huainan and other mines, issued a proposal to coal mines across the country to launch competitions. However, on July 21st, Tangshan area experienced torrential rain, mountain torrents broke out, and rivers flooded. All the shafts of Kailuan mines, both above and below ground, suffered water intrusion. Among them, Zhaogezhuang Mine, which was the most severely affected, was completely shut down on July 22nd, and many workers in other mines were unable to work due to the floods, seriously affecting production. However, the workers of Kailuan Coal Mine were not intimidated by the difficulties. While actively draining water and rushing to rescue, quickly restoring the flooded mines to normal production, they also worked hard to increase the daily output level, making up for the shortfall. As a result, the production plan for the entire month was still overfulfilled. At present, various mines have further strengthened the work of preventing rain and drainage and ensuring that workers' attendance is not affected by the rainy season, creating conditions for the smooth completion of the August production plan.

In July, Kailuan Coal Mine opened thirty-two new tunneling faces, and at the same time, universally launched the "high speed, high quality, safety, economy" competition in the tunneling area, greatly accelerating the tunneling speed. In August, this mine will continue to strengthen production preparation work. For the working faces planned to be put into recovery mining in August, designated personnel have been assigned to be responsible for regular inspections. They are also preparing to hold a production preparation work conference in the entire mining area at the beginning of the month to summarize and promote a series of experiences to accelerate tunneling speed, such as slotting blasting and improving supports, to ensure that the entire mine has more coal reserves.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 2nd: After overfulfilling the July coal production plan by more than 12,000 tons, the mines under the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau have taken measures to seize even greater abundance in August.

Last month, the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau strengthened tunneling work, thus increasing the number of working faces put into recovery mining this month from thirteen last month to twenty-two; at the same time, various mines universally overhauled important mechanical equipment such as coal chutes and water pumps, creating conditions for producing more coal in August. In August, the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau required coal production to increase by 15.5% compared to July and tunneling footage to increase by 3.24% compared to July; and required all mines to seize the beginning of the month and organize coal mining and tunneling to complete the plan on a daily and ten-day basis.

Now, each mine has designated a deputy mine manager to be specifically responsible for leading production preparation work, and has formulated plans to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution in coal mining, tunneling, and other aspects. The Mining Bureau has also organized two work groups to assist the mines in solving current production problems and promoting advanced experiences. On July 31st and August 1st, all mines have held employee congresses, mobilizing and organizing the masses to launch competitions to seize greater abundance in August.

    辽宁开滦和焦作等地煤矿决心乘胜前进
    八月份再争煤炭超产
    新华社沈阳2日电　辽宁省抚顺、阜新、本溪、北票四大国营煤矿的职工正在乘胜猛进，决心全面超额完成8月份的煤炭生产计划。
    这四大煤矿7月份已经超额完成了全月煤炭生产计划，煤炭产量比6月份增加四十万吨；煤炭的生产水平逐旬上升。目前，职工们干劲很足，掀起了增产煤炭的新高潮；同时，各矿加强了掘进工作，已经为8月份准备下足够的获得煤量。煤炭工业部规定的三十六项先进经验，已经在大部分煤矿中推广，成为增产煤炭的重要因素。从中共辽宁省委、各市市委到矿区党委，都加强了对煤矿的具体领导，许多矿健全和建立了各种责任制度，加强了生产管理工作。这些因素正促进煤炭大面积丰产运动更深入发展。
    7月30日、31日两天，辽宁省煤炭管理局又一次具体地安排了8月份、特别是8月上旬的生产任务。各矿也纷纷总结任务完成得出色的单位的经验，检查有些单位任务完成得不够好的原因，发动矿工学习先进，赶上先进。辽宁省煤炭管理局并对所属日产万吨和七、八千吨煤的大矿井的设备检修工作作了统一的具体安排，避免过去因为几个矿井同时检修而影响生产的缺点，保证8月份生产水平能够稳步提高。沈阳、旅大、安东、营口等地厂矿支援煤矿的大量滚珠轴承和各种钢材，正送往急需这些物资的煤矿，以供检修机电设备之用。最近两天，四大煤矿都打电话来，向辽宁省煤炭管理局表示一定要超额完成8月上旬的生产计划。
    新华社唐山2日电　开滦煤矿继续深入发动群众围绕大面积丰产开展竞赛，保证8月份提前超额完成产煤计划。
    今年上半年，开滦煤矿职工超额完成了原煤生产计划。7月上旬，这个煤矿和京西、抚顺、阜新、淮南等矿向全国煤矿发出开展竞赛的倡议。但是在7月21日，唐山地区发生暴雨，山洪暴发，河水泛滥。开滦各矿井上井下都遭受水侵，其中受害最深的赵各庄矿在7月22日全部停产，其他矿也有不少工人由于洪水阻隔不能上班，严重地影响了生产。但是，开滦煤矿的职工并没有被困难吓倒，他们一面积极排水抢险，使被淹的矿井迅速恢复了正常生产，一面努力提高日产水平，弥补亏欠。结果全月仍然超额完成了生产计划。目前，各矿又进一步加强了防雨排水和保证工人出勤不受雨季影响的工作，为顺利地完成8月份生产计划创造条件。
    7月份，开滦煤矿新开了三十二个掘进头，同时在掘进区普遍地开展了“高速、优质、安全、节约”竞赛，大大加快了掘进速度。8月份，这个矿继续加强生产准备工作，对于8月份计划投入回采的工作面，都已指定专人负责，定期检查。他们还准备在月初召开全矿区生产准备工作会议，总结推广掏槽爆破、改进支架等一系列加快掘进速度的经验，保证全矿有更多的获得煤量。
    新华社郑州2日电　焦作矿务局所属各矿在超额一万二千多吨完成7月份煤炭生产计划之后，又采取措施夺取8月份更大的丰产。
    上个月焦作矿务局加强了掘进工作，因此使这个月投入回采的工作面由上个月的十三个增加到二十二个；同时各矿普遍检修了溜煤槽、水泵等重要机械设备，为8月份增产更多的煤炭创造了条件。8月份，焦作矿务局要求煤炭产量比7月份提高15.5％，掘进进尺比7月份增加3.24％；并且要求各矿月初就抓紧，组织采煤、掘进按日、按旬地完成计划。
    现在，各矿都指定一名副矿长专门负责领导生产准备工作，并且制定了在采煤、掘进等方面开展技术革新和技术革命的方案。矿务局也组织两个工作组，到各矿协助解决当前生产中的问题和推广先进经验。7月31日和8月1日，各矿都已经分别举行职工大会，动员和组织群众开展竞赛，夺取8月份更大的丰产。
