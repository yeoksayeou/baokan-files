Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 17th: The Latin American Labor Alliance, headquartered in Mexico, has issued a call to action, urging the proletariat of Latin America and other democratic and patriotic forces to unite in support of the Cuban people. The call expresses the determination of the Latin American working class to intensify the struggle against US imperialism, for national independence, and for progress and the welfare of the people. The call was published in the Cuban newspaper "Hoy" on the 16th.

The call points out that US imperialism is attempting to use the Organization of American States as a tool to oppose the Cuban democratic revolution, continuing its shameless path of direct intervention, just as it did against the democratic government of Guatemala in the past. The people of the world, especially the people of Latin America who have suffered greatly from US imperialist colonial oppression and have personally experienced the consequences of US imperialist direct intervention more than once, know that only by uniting their forces against the forces of exploitation can they stop their bullying and their anti-democratic ugly deeds.

The call urges all progressive social strata to unite in the face of threats against Cuba. The call says that the people of our countries are disturbed by the threats against the Cuban people who are engaged in a democratic struggle. This threat has aroused support for the Cuban cause and has awakened people to carry out strong support activities to defend Cuba. International support, especially the support of the Latin American people, will help strengthen the Cuban people's struggle and encourage their determination to fight for freedom, sovereignty, and independence. At the same time, the maintenance and consolidation of Cuban democracy will help the people of our countries achieve their most important demands for rights.

Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: Newspapers in Chile, Argentina, Colombia, and other countries have condemned Herter's scheming tricks at the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas.

The Chilean newspaper "Siglo" published an editorial on the 14th entitled "Exposing the Painted Skin," accusing Herter's speech at the meeting of being a "sanctimonious" and "shameless" speech. The editorial said that after Herter verbally announced his support for the principle of non-intervention, it was time for him to start playing his real tricks. Herter demanded the establishment of a special committee to investigate the tense situation in the Caribbean region. What he demanded "is essentially to provide him with the necessary tools to legally suppress the Cuban revolution, just as the Jacobo Árbenz regime in Guatemala was suppressed under the cover of the Caracas Conference in 1954."

The newspaper published a commentary on the 15th, questioning Herter's proposal to establish a committee to supervise the implementation of "democracy": What legal and moral right does the United States have to investigate violations of human rights and representative democracy? If this committee is established, what role can it play against the United States, the main cause of the tense situation, instability, and poverty in the Caribbean region? It would be absurd to imagine that a committee of the Organization of American States would ask for the rulers of Little Rock (the American city that discriminates against blacks) to be imprisoned, overthrow the dictatorships of Somoza, Trujillo, and Stroessner, or rebuild democracy in Guatemala. This committee will also never abolish the (American) military bases in the Caribbean region or restrain the (American) United Fruit Company, Mobil Oil Company, Anaconda Copper Company, or sugar and tobacco consortia.

The Argentine newspaper "Razón" published a commentary on the 15th, exposing the true face of the proposal made by US Secretary of State Herter at the Meeting of Foreign Ministers. The commentary pointed out that even the very forgetful would not forget that the dictatorial regimes of Nicaragua, Dominican Republic and Paraguay "have benefited from the attitude taken by the U.S. State Department"; at the same time, the State Department was also "the pillar of the tyrants who have been overthrown."

The Colombian weekly "Voz Democrática" published a commentary on the 14th, exposing the conspiracy planned by Herter under the guise of opposing "communist infiltration," saying that the conspiracy planned by the United States in Santiago, Chile, is not only aimed at Cuba, but also attempts to use the pretext of "communist infiltration" into the Cuban government to bind all the representatives of the Latin American countries participating in this Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas, in order to force them to sign secret anti-communist agreements. However, the people of Latin American countries are unwilling to walk with the US imperialism that causes their hunger and poverty, nor are they willing to defend the Monroe Doctrine of the American continent for the Americans.

　　拉丁美洲劳工联盟向无产者发出号召
　　支持古巴人民　反对美国压迫
　　智利等国报纸揭穿赫脱扮演干涉者的可耻角色
    新华社哈瓦那17日电　总部设在墨西哥的拉丁美洲劳工联盟发出号召书，号召拉丁美洲的无产阶级和其他民主爱国力量团结起来支持古巴人民，号召书表示拉丁美洲的工人阶级决心加紧反对美帝国主义、争取民族独立以及争取进步和人民福利的斗争。这个号召书发表在16日的古巴“今日报”上。
    号召书指出，美帝国主义企图利用美洲国家组织作为反对古巴民主革命的工具，继续走它进行直接干涉的无耻道路，正如它过去对危地马拉民主政权所干的勾当那样。全世界人民，特别是饱受美帝国主义殖民压迫，并且不止一次地亲身遭受过美帝国主义直接干涉后果的拉丁美洲人民知道，只有把他们的力量团结起来反对剥削势力，才有可能制止他们的欺凌，制止他们反民主的丑恶勾当。
    号召书呼吁一切进步社会阶层在针对古巴的威胁面前团结起来。号召书说，我们各国人民对正在进行民主斗争的古巴人民遭到的威胁感到不安，这种威胁激起了对古巴事业的支持，唤起人们进行强大的保卫古巴的支援活动。国际支援，特别是拉丁美洲人民的支援将有助于加强古巴人民的斗争，鼓舞他们争取自由、主权和独立的决心。同时古巴民主的保持和巩固将有助于我们各国人民争取实现最重大的权利要求。
    据新华社17日讯　智利、阿根廷、哥伦比亚等国报纸斥责赫脱在美洲外长会议上玩弄阴谋伎俩。
    智利“世纪报”14日以“揭穿画皮”为题发表社论，指责赫脱在会上的发言是一篇“道貌岸然的”、“寡廉鲜耻的”讲话。社论说，赫脱在口头上宣布支持不干涉原则之后就是他开始耍真把戏的时候了。赫脱要求建立一个特别委员会来调查加勒比地区的紧张局势，他所要求的东西“实质上是为他提供一个合法地镇压古巴革命所必需的工具，正如1954年在加拉加斯会议的掩护下对危地马拉的哈科沃·阿本斯政权所干的那样”。
    这家报纸15日发表评论，针对赫脱提出的成立一个委员会来监督实施“民主”的主张质问道：美国有什么法律和道义的权力对于违反人权和代议制民主进行调查呢？如果这个委员会建立起来，那么对加勒比地区紧张局势、不稳和贫困的主要造成者美国能起什么作用呢？如果有人设想美洲国家组织的一个委员会会要求把（歧视黑人的美国）小石城的统治者关进监牢，会推翻索摩查、特鲁希略及斯特罗斯纳的独裁政权或重建危地马拉的民主，那是非常荒诞的。这个委员会也决不会取消加勒比地区的（美国）军事基地和抑制（美国的）联合果品公司、美孚油公司、安那康达铜公司或糖业和烟草财团。
    阿根廷“理性报”15日发表评论，揭露美国国务卿赫脱在外长会议上提出的建议的真面目。评论指出，即使非常健忘，也不会忘记，尼加拉瓜、多米尼加和巴拉圭的独裁政权“都从美国国务院所采取的态度中得到利益”；同时，国务院同样也是那些“已被推翻的暴君的支柱。”
    哥伦比亚“民主呼声报”周刊14日发表评论，揭露赫脱在反对“共产主义渗入”的幌子下策划的阴谋说，美国在智利圣地亚哥策划的阴谋不只是针对古巴，它还企图利用“共产党渗入”古巴政府为借口束缚住参加这次美洲外长会议的所有拉丁美洲各国的代表，以便迫使他们签订秘密的反共协定，但是拉丁美洲各国人民不愿意和造成他们饥饿和贫穷的美帝国主义一起走，也不愿为美国人保卫美洲大陆的门罗主义。
