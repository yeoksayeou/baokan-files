    Ode to "August First City"
    Ling He

    Heroic city – Nanchang! The place of the "August First" Uprising. It was here, on the high building by the Xima Pool, that the first shot of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army rang out, declaring to the world that the revolutionary forces of the proletariat would counter-attack and eliminate the counter-revolutionary armed forces of the landlord, bureaucratic, and comprador bourgeoisie!

    From that day on, dawn of August 1, 1927, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was born, and the first red flag fluttered over Nanchang. Defeating the enemy, strengthening the forces, marching towards southern Jiangxi. Fight, fight, and fight again! Jinggang Mountain in western Jiangxi, Ruijin in southern Jiangxi, thousands of red flags, even more vividly colored. Fight, fight, and fight again! Twenty-two years of successive armed revolution finally hoisted the victorious red flag high over Beijing!

    From Nanchang to Beijing, from Xima Pool to Tiananmen, the blood of the Red Army – the People's Liberation Army's martyrs – has been sprinkled all over this long journey! Now, the heroic sons and daughters of the motherland, with ten years of construction, are consolidating peace; the brilliant victory makes the working people of the world excited for us. How can we not cheer and sing praises of Nanchang, the starting point of the revolution!

    The heroic city of Nanchang is also a historical and cultural center with a long history. As early as the Spring and Autumn period before Christ, it was a battlefield fought over by feudal lords. In the Spring and Autumn period, it belonged to the State of Wu; during the Warring States period, it was part of the State of Chu; during the Qin Dynasty, it was Jiujiang Commandery; and during the Han Dynasty, it was Yuzhang Commandery. From the Han Dynasty to the Five Dynasties, the county was named Nanchang. It was named Hongzhou because of the Hongya Well, and Hongdu Prefecture was established during the Wude years of the Tang Dynasty. The Southern Tang Dynasty promoted Hongzhou to Southern Capital, and during the Song Dynasty, Hongzhou was part of Jiangnan West Circuit. It was renamed Longxing Circuit during the Yuan Dynasty and reverted to Nanchang Prefecture during the Ming Dynasty. From the Qing Dynasty to the present, it has always been the provincial capital of Jiangxi. More than two thousand years of historical tradition have left a cultural foundation for the new socialist Nanchang.

    Whoever comes to visit Nanchang, who would not want to ascend the scenic Tengwang Pavilion? Wang Bo of the Tang Dynasty wrote in his preface: "Layer upon layer of peaks rise into the emerald sky, and flying pavilions, painted in vermillion, hang over the abyss." Han Yu wrote in his record: "The beauty of sightseeing is abundant in Jiangnan, but the Tengwang Pavilion is the best." "Falling clouds and lone ducks fly together; the autumn water shares one color with the long sky," perfectly describing the scenery at that time; "Painted rafters fly towards the clouds of Nanpu in the morning, and beaded curtains are rolled up with the rain of the Western Mountains in the evening," portraying the poet's feelings. The pavilion is famous because of its literature, but it has been destroyed by fire in various dynasties and rebuilt many times, but the Northern Warlords burned the pavilion in an attempt to prevent the Northern Expedition. The counter-revolutionary destruction of cultural relics still makes people resentful!

    After ten years of construction, the ancient Nanchang is very different from what it used to be. Before liberation, there were only a few factories with more than one hundred people, and those who operated the factories were actually speculators. After liberation, on this dilapidated foundation, industry and handicraft industry have developed greatly, and the total output value has increased by more than 18.5 times compared with 1949. Here now there are power machinery such as steel, coke, alloy, automobiles and motorcycles, as well as motors, chemicals, cement, rubber, papermaking, as well as cotton and linen spinning. In the past, the reactionary bureaucrats of the Kuomintang only built luxurious residences for themselves in the north of the city, while the slums where the working people lived were filthy and the sewers were clogged. Now, the 50-meter-wide Bayi Avenue runs through the city from north to south. Tall buildings, in the old Feijiang Airport in the east of the city, stand densely together; the office building of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee stands majestically in this ancient city.

      The heroic city of the "August First" Uprising, and the memorials related to “August First," all inspire admiration. On the bank of the pool where the Han general Guan Ying washed his horses, the original building of the Jiangxi Grand Hotel still exists. People admire the great achievements of the Red Army uprising and learn from Marshal Zhu De's arduous struggle. Visit the old site of the officer training corps of Jiangwu Hall, and the bullet marks on the wall of Marshal He Long's command post are enough to imagine the lofty aspirations of those years. The old Gongyuan, one of the battlefields at that time, has now been turned into "Bayi" Park. Here, trees tower into the sky and hundreds of flowers compete for beauty. Peonies bloom on the banks of Wanliu in spring, and famous chrysanthemums are displayed in Su Gong Pu in autumn. The yellow glazed Zhuting is hidden by green trees, and the red railing bridge surrounds the corridors. The Baihuazhou grass is covered with grass, and the Guanaoting painted boat gently sways. Fish chase water and play with duckweed, and swallows turn the wind and play with fallen flowers. Xin Jiaxuan’s poem for Yuan Jizhi's return to Yuzhang says: "The road on Donghu Lake in February, the official road is tender with willows and wild plums are fragrant," although there are not many plums now, the peach and apricot blossoms add color to the willow embankment. Such a beautiful Donghu scenery, on a beautiful spring day, makes tourists feel nostalgic. The torch of communist revolution was burning high in those years, precisely for the victorious laughter of socialist construction today.

    Our construction will never be satisfied with the reconstruction of the "August First" Bridge, although it was originally a dilapidated wooden structure during the Kuomintang era. Now it is a steel frame structure with an asphalt pavement, spanning the vast Gan River, three miles long, flat and safe; however, in order to connect the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Nanxun railways into one line, we are building a new large iron bridge to the north of this first highway bridge in the country. It hangs like a rainbow across the water and sky. Moreover, it has been decided in the plan to rebuild the famous Tengwang Pavilion to the east of the "August First" Bridge, and to arrange a spacious garden. Whenever the weather is fine and sunny, many people visit the riverbank, looking at the clouds rolling over the Western Mountains, the water connecting the sky, and the wind on the river sending thousands of sails, sailing to the other side of Poyang Lake. Especially in the spring dusk, many egrets cross the river, with a leisurely attitude. When I was recuperating in Jiangbin Hospital, I got a quatrain about the night scene of the Gan River:

        Fishermen sing late, returning sails are near,
        White egrets fly high, skimming pale clouds,
        Should I go back after standing in the slanting sun?
        The moon's reflection sways on the waves and stirs emotions.

    In March of late spring, crowds of people cross the river to Sancun in the suburbs to see the peach blossoms. It is really red spring village with flowers like the sea, making people feel comfortable. Young men and women, either carrying willow woven flower baskets, or picking peach branches full of hands, singing and dancing all the way, until dusk, are willing to board the return ferry. In August of mid-autumn, people go to Qingyunpu in the southern suburbs to seek autumn colors. The old osmanthus tree of the Tang Dynasty, with luxuriant branches and leaves, the fragrance can be heard for several miles, and the Bada Shanren Memorial Hall displays Zhu Da's posthumous works, which also add luster to the ancient temple. In summer, go to Meiling in the Western Mountains to escape the summer heat, and in winter, go to the new park in the eastern suburbs to step on the snow and find plums; stroll in the shade of Yangming Road in the evening, and listen to the ancient tunes of Yiyang in the Gan Opera House at night, cultural life can be continuously enriched.

    Nanchang is developing year by year in construction, and I cannot possibly introduce it comprehensively. It shines in the history of the Chinese revolution, and will also contribute unlimited strength to production and cultural construction. I praise Nanchang with a bald pen, and express the common wishes of thousands of people - it will be a revolutionary castle, a paradise on earth.

    “八一城”赞
    凌鹤
    英雄城市——南昌！“八一”起义的地方。就在这洗马池的高楼上，中国工农红军的第一声枪响，向全世界宣告：无产阶级的革命力量，要反击和消灭地主官僚买办资产阶级的反革命武装！
    从这一天起，1927年8月1日黎明，诞生了中国工农红军，第一面红旗飘扬在南昌城。击败敌人，壮大力量，向赣南进军。战斗，战斗，再战斗，赣西的井岗山，赣南的瑞京，千百面红旗，更加颜色鲜明。战斗，战斗，再战斗，二十二年前仆后继的武装革命，终于把胜利的红旗，高高地插上了北京城！
    从南昌到北京，从洗马池到天安门，红军——解放军的烈士们的鲜血，洒遍了这漫长的征程！如今，祖国的英雄儿女，十年建设，巩固和平；辉煌的胜利，教全世界劳动人民为我们兴奋，怎能不教人欢呼歌颂革命起点的南昌城！
    英雄城市南昌，也是历史悠久的文物之邦。远在公元前春秋时代，它就是诸侯争夺的战场。春秋属吴地，战国为楚疆，秦为九江郡，汉郡名豫章。自汉迄五代，属县为南昌。因有洪崖井而定名洪州，唐朝武德年曾置洪都府。南唐升洪州为南都，宋代分洪州属江南西路。元改隆兴路，明复南昌府。满清到如今，一直是江西的省会首府。二千多年的历史传统，给社会主义新南昌留下了文化基础。
    无论谁来拜访南昌城，谁不愿意登临滕王阁胜境？唐代王勃作序：“层峦耸翠，上出重霄，飞阁流丹，下临无地”。韩愈为记：“江南多游观之美，而滕王阁独为第一。”“落霞与孤鹜齐飞，秋水共长天一色”，写绝了当时的景物；“画栋朝飞南浦云，珠帘暮卷西山雨”，刻划了骚客的诗情。阁以文传，但历朝多毁于火，屡经重建，而北洋军阀却焚阁企图阻制北伐进军。反革命摧残文物，至今还教人留着憎恨！
    十年建设，古老的南昌，和从前大不一样。解放前仅有百人以上的几家工厂，经营工厂的实际上都是投机商。解放后，在这破烂摊子上，工业、手工业大发展，总产值比1949年增长十八点五倍强。这里现在有了钢铁、焦炭、合金、汽车摩托等动力机械，有电机、化学、水泥、橡胶、造纸、还有棉纺和麻纺。过去，国民党的反动官僚们只为自己在城北建设豪华的住宅，而劳动人民聚居的贫民窟却是污秽不堪，下水道污塞。如今，五十米宽的八一大道，贯串市区南北。高大的建筑物，在城东老飞机场上，栉比冲天；江西省人民委员会办公大楼，雄伟地高矗在这古老的城阙。
      “八一”起义的英雄城，有关
  “八一”的纪念物，莫不使人们十分钦敬。汉将灌婴洗马的池滨，当年的江西大旅社原屋尚存。人们瞻仰红军起义的丰功伟业，学习朱德元帅的艰苦斗争。去参观讲武堂的军官教导团旧址，贺龙元帅的指挥部墙上的弹痕累累，便可想见当年的壮志凌云。当时的战场之一的旧贡院，现在已改为“八一”公园。这里是树木参天，百花斗艳，春日牡丹开放在万柳堤边，秋天的名菊陈列于苏公圃畔。黄琉璃的朱亭绿掩，红栏杆的桥曲廊环。百花洲草茵铺地，冠鳌亭画舫轻摇。游鱼逐水戏浮萍，飞燕翻风弄落蕊。辛稼轩送元济之归豫章词有云：“二月东湖湖上路，官途柳嫩野梅香”，现在梅虽不多，而桃杏花开，却为柳堤增色不少。如此美丽的东湖风景，春秋佳日教游人情牵梦绕。当年共产主义革命的火炬高烧，正是为了今天社会主义建设的胜利欢笑。
    我们的建设，决不满足于“八一”大桥的改建，虽然它在国民党时代原为木质的破烂不堪，现在是钢架结构，沥青路面，横跨浩瀚的赣江，全长三华里，平坦安全；但是为了联结浙赣、南浔铁道为一线，我们又在这全国第一公路桥的北面，建设一座新的大铁桥，它像长虹一样横挂在水际天边。而且，计划中已决定重建有名的滕王阁在“八一”桥东?，还要安排一座宽阔的花园。每当风和日丽，多少人游览江畔，遥望西山云卷，水光接天，大江风送千帆，驶向鄱湖彼岸。尤其是春日黄昏，多少白鹭横江，神态悠然。我在江滨医院养病时，得绝句写赣江夜色：
        渔歌唱晚归帆近，
        白鹭高飞掠淡云，
        立尽斜晖回去否？
        波摇月影又勾情。
    暮春三月，渡水到城郊三村看桃花的人群，络绎不绝。那真是红遍春村花似海，使人舒畅情怀。少年男女，或携柳织的花篮，或摘桃枝盈手，一路高歌轻舞，直到黄昏，才肯坐上归渡。仲秋八月，人们都到南郊青云谱寻访秋色。唐代的老桂树，枝繁叶茂，香闻数里，而八大山人纪念馆陈列着朱耷的遗作，也使古庙生辉。夏日到西山梅岭避暑，冬天到东郊新公园踏雪寻梅；黄昏在阳明路的林荫中散步，夜间在赣剧院听弋阳古曲，文化生活得以不断的丰富。
    南昌在建设中，年年在向前发展，我也不可能介绍的比较全面。它在中国革命史上发射光芒，而在生产、文化建设上也将贡献出无限的力量。我以秃笔礼赞南昌，谨抒发千万人共同的愿望，——它将是革命的城堡，人世的天堂。
