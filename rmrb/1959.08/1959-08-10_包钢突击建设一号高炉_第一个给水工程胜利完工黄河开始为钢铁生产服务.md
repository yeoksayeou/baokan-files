Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 9th August: The Baotou Iron and Steel Company is concentrating all its efforts on rushing the construction of the No. 1 blast furnace project. The broad masses of workers are full of energy and determined to strive to complete the No. 1 blast furnace as soon as possible.

As of the 5th, twenty-five layers of the fifty layers of carbon bricks for the No. 1 blast furnace itself have been laid, and six layers of high-alumina bricks have been laid for the furnace bottom. It is estimated that all bricklaying work can be completed by the end of this month. The 20,000 meters of cable from the blast furnace to the inclined bridge main winch are about to be installed. The bricklaying work of the three hot blast furnaces has been basically completed, and the equipment installation of the gas scrubbing system has also been largely completed. The civil engineering and equipment installation of the material yard bridge, belt conveyor corridor, transfer station and other feeding systems are proceeding at full speed. The blower station, casting machine room, slag pot car repair depot, pig iron warehouse, substation, water pump station, cooling tower and other projects have also been largely completed or are nearing completion.

Next to the No. 4 coke oven, which is already in production, workers are working hard to build Baotou Steel's second large-scale modern coke oven – the No. 3 coke oven. The three major components of this coke oven, namely the furnace door pillars, furnace door frames, and protective plates, have been installed, and the oven will soon be baked. The construction of the entire coking plant's coal blending system and coal delivery system is being stepped up. The Baiyun Obo Iron Mine, which supplies the rich ore for the large blast furnace, is rushing to build the reinforcement project of the crushing system. The main mine has already begun to mine ore, and three sections of the four-section mountain railway in the East Mine have begun to be laid, and the electric locomotive will be able to go up the mountain at the end of August.

In order to speed up the progress of the project, the High Furnace Work Area Headquarters has comprehensively arranged the construction plan of various projects in accordance with the requirements of the joint trial operation since July. In order to produce iron from the blast furnace as soon as possible, the broad masses of workers have enthusiastically carried out competitions. Various construction departments cooperated with each other and created construction conditions for each other, which greatly accelerated the progress of the project.

While stepping up the construction of the No. 1 blast furnace, the Baotou Iron and Steel Company is actively carrying out various production preparations to welcome iron production. The production post procedures study conducted by production workers and on-site technicians and the training of new workers have now ended. Workers and technicians who studied at Anshan Iron and Steel and Wuhan Iron and Steel have also returned to Baotou Steel one after another. Baiyun Obo iron mine workers began to step up the storage of rich ore for the No. 1 blast furnace in July, and a large amount of ore supported by Longyan Iron and Steel Plant to Baotou Steel has been crushed. The limestone needed for ironmaking is also continuously transported from the Baolan Railway. The No. 4 coke oven of Baotou Steel Coking Plant is preparing to produce metallurgical coke of the specifications required by the large blast furnace to supply the needs of the blast furnace for ironmaking.

Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 9th August: After the completion of the first water supply system of the Yellow River water supply project of Baotou Iron and Steel Company, after repeated test runs and water tests, it met the design standards and began to supply water to the factory area at 7 pm on August 4. It turned the turbid Yellow River water into a clear stream, flowing continuously to the blast furnace to serve steel production. The entire operation of this water supply project is electrified. Its completion marks that the day for the No. 1 blast furnace of Baotou Steel to produce iron is getting closer and closer.

In order to complete this water supply project, the workers who built Baotou Steel made great efforts, overcoming the difficulties and bravely overcoming the intense heat, severe cold and floods. In the construction process, underwater operations alone required sucking more than 600,000 cubic meters of mud and throwing tens of thousands of cubic meters of stones; it was also necessary to blast rocks underwater, fill in crushed stones, lay cables, pour concrete, and build cofferdams, as well as carry out ice-chisel sinking rows, which was the first construction in China. Not only was the project huge, but the technology was also complex. In the construction process, the employees worked hard and cleverly, overcame the intense heat and severe cold, and conquered the numerous difficulties in construction caused by underground quicksand. Many departments and many regions across the country have dispatched manpower and materials to support the project, and Soviet experts have also enthusiastically guided the construction.

    包钢突击建设一号高炉
    第一个给水工程胜利完工黄河开始为钢铁生产服务
    新华社包头9日电　包头钢铁公司正在集中一切力量突击建设一号高炉工程。广大职工干劲十足，决心争取尽快建成一号高炉。
    到5日止，一号高炉本炉的五十层炭砖已经砌完了二十五层，炉底的高铝砖砌完了六层，预计全部砌砖工程本月底前就可全部完成。从高炉到斜桥主卷扬机的两万米电缆即将装完，三座热风炉炉体的砌砖工程已经基本结束，煤气洗涤系统的设备安装工程也已大部完成。料仓栈桥、皮带运输通廊、转运站等供料系统的土建工程和设备安装工程正在兼程前进，鼓风机站、铸铁机室、渣罐车修理库、生铁库和变电所、水泵站、冷却塔等工程，也都已经大部完工或接近完工。
    在已经投入生产的四号炼焦炉旁边，工人们正在紧张地建设着包钢第二座大型现代化焦炉——三号焦炉。这座焦炉的炉门支柱、炉门框、保护板等三大件已经安完，不久就要开始烘炉。整个焦化厂的配炭系统和送煤系统工程，都在加紧建设中。供应大高炉富矿的白云鄂博铁矿，正在突击建设破碎系统的加固工程，主矿山已经开始开采矿石，东矿的四段盘山铁路，有三段已经开始铺轨，电机车8月末就可以上山。
    为了加快工程进度，高炉工区指挥部从7月份起就按照联合试车的要求，综合安排了各项工程的施工计划，广大职工为了尽快让高炉出铁，轰轰烈烈地开展了竞赛。各个施工部门互相协作互相创造施工条件，大大加快了工程进度。
    在加紧建设一号高炉的同时，包头钢铁公司正在积极进行各项生产准备工作，迎接出铁。生产工人和现场技术人员进行的生产岗位规程学习和新工人的培训工作现在已经结束。在鞍钢、武钢学习的工人和技术人员，也先后回到了包钢。白云鄂博铁矿山工人从7月份就开始为一号高炉开炉加紧储备富矿矿石，龙烟钢铁厂支援包钢的大量矿石，已经破碎。炼铁需要的石灰石也从包兰铁路不断运来。包钢焦化厂四号焦炉，正在准备按照大高炉要求的规格生产冶金焦炭，供应高炉炼铁需要。
    据新华社包头9日电　包头钢铁公司黄河给水工程第一个给水系统完工后，经过多次试车试水鉴定，合乎设计标准，已于8月4日下午七时开始向厂区送水。它使混浊的黄河水变成了清流，源源地流到高炉边为钢铁生产服务。这个给水工程的全部操作都是电气化的。它的建成，标志着包钢一号高炉出铁的日子愈来愈近了。
    为建成这个给水工程，建设包钢的工人们付出了很大的劳动，不畏艰难地战胜了酷暑、严寒和洪水。在施工中，光是水下作业，就要吸泥六十多万立方米，抛石几万立方米；还要在水下爆破岩石、填垫碎石、敷设电缆、浇灌混凝土和堆筑围堰以及进行国内首次施工的凿冰沉排等等。不仅工程浩大，而且技术复杂。在施工过程中，职工们苦干巧干，战胜酷暑和严寒，制伏了地下流沙造成的施工中的重重困难。全国有许多部门许多地区都调派人力物力来支援，苏联专家们也热情地指导了施工建设。
