My Brother Demobilizes, I Enlist
(Lyrics)

	My brother Hong Yuan demobilized and returned home,
	I’m enlisting and about to depart,
	Neighbors come to congratulate,
	Double happiness arrives at our home,
	Dad is overjoyed, Mom is busy,
	Little sister made two big red flowers.
	In the morning, a welcome meeting was held,
	I took my brother back home,
	The brothers met and shook hands,
	The whole family laughed,
	The militia team has a good coach,
	The commune has a good hand for farming.
	In the afternoon, a farewell meeting was held,
	My brother saw me off to depart,
	Mom and Dad gave careful instructions,
	The militia captain told jokes,
	He said the militia team is sending me to study abroad,
	In three years, I must become a military strategist.
	Happily, I entered the barracks,
	The company commander chatted with me,
	Your brother was a squad leader in the third squad,
	The soldiers of the third squad all praised him,
	Said his name is always on the honor roll,
	His chest always bears a flower of glory.
	Praising my brother, I am not convinced,
	It seems that I, this younger brother, am not as good as him,
	Squad leader, please guide me more,
	Comrades, help me, my confidence is great,
	The younger brother should be stronger than the older brother,
	If I don't surpass my brother, I won't go home.

    哥哥复员我当兵
    （歌词）
    洪源哥哥复员转回家，我应征入伍要出发，街坊四邻来祝贺，双喜临门到我家，乐坏了爹爹忙坏了妈，小妹妹做了两朵大红花。前半晌开了欢迎会，我接哥哥转回家，哥俩见面忙拉手，一家老小笑哈哈，民兵队多了个好教练，公社里多了一把好手种庄稼。后半晌又开那欢送会，哥哥送我去出发，爸爸妈妈细叮咛，民兵队长他说笑话，他说民兵队送我去留学，三年里要我学成个军事家。欢欢喜喜我进了营房，连长和我拉家常，你哥哥在三班当过班长三班的战士都把他夸，说他名字不离光荣榜，胸前常带光荣花。夸奖哥哥我不服气，好像我这弟弟不如他，班长请你多领导，同志们帮助我信心大，弟弟应该比哥哥强，不超过哥哥我就不回家。
