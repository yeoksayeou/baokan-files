    Conserving Working Capital
    Managing and utilizing working capital effectively is an important part of the drive for increased production and thrift in industrial and commercial enterprises. It is of great significance for increasing production, expanding circulation, and accelerating national construction.
    Working capital occupies an important position in the allocation of state funds. Based on the needs of various sectors of the national economy for funds in developing production, the state lists different funding items, including working capital and fixed capital. Although these funds have commonalities, such as each yuan representing a certain amount of materials, there are strict distinctions between them. What is working capital? All expenses incurred in the production and circulation sectors for purchasing raw materials, materials, fuel, and packaging materials, as well as paying wages, i.e., the funds needed to function only in one production cycle, are working capital. It circulates repeatedly in production, continuously ensuring the normal progress of production and turnover. Like fixed capital, working capital is an indispensable fund for enterprises to carry out production and commodity turnover. With the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production and construction in our country, the state increases a large amount of working capital every year.
    The correct management and use of working capital not only has a very important impact on promoting economic accounting in enterprises and improving the production and management level of enterprises, but also has a significant impact on the state's planned allocation of funds and materials. We know that the credit funds allocated by the state to various enterprises are planned and have a certain limit. No enterprise can borrow from the state bank without any restrictions. Therefore, the use of working capital by enterprises must not only be planned, but also fully and effectively utilized. All aspects and links of the production department must be coordinated; problems in any aspect or link will prevent the acceleration of capital turnover and the effective use of working capital. For example, if the specifications and quality of a product produced by an enterprise do not meet the requirements, this seems to be a production matter, but if these products with unqualified specifications and quality cannot be sold, resulting in a backlog of working capital, and the enterprise still has to maintain production (such as continuing to purchase raw materials and pay wages), difficulties will inevitably arise. For another example, in order to complete the production plan, the enterprise must correctly formulate various quotas and necessary systems. If there is no clear idea of the numbers and the quantity of work-in-progress, semi-finished products, and raw material reserves exceeds the needs of normal turnover, it will also cause a backlog of working capital, which is detrimental to production. All these situations show that the management and use of working capital is closely related to the production of the enterprise. At the same time, it is not difficult to see that the management and use of working capital is a very important part of the enterprise's implementation of economic accounting, increasing production and practicing thrift.
    At present, the overall situation of the management and use of working capital in enterprises is good; however, there are also some problems. For example, the total value of industrial production in the first half of this year increased significantly compared with the same period last year, and the working capital required by industrial enterprises must of course increase accordingly, which is reasonable; however, the increase in working capital in individual enterprises has exceeded the normal needs of maintaining production turnover. This fact shows that there are unreasonable aspects in the production and management of these units. There are certain objective reasons for this abnormal phenomenon, such as some accessories that have been produced according to plan, but have formed a backlog due to some objective reasons. In addition, there are also subjective reasons, such as some factories using working capital for capital construction, purchasing a large amount of raw materials without regard to actual needs, and purchasing a large amount of materials and putting them into mass production before the product trial production is successful; in the commercial system, some units have inventory products that are not suitable for the needs of the region and the unit, and so on. All these have caused a backlog of working capital, which affects the production and circulation of goods. For all these situations, we must take appropriate measures to strengthen the planning of working capital management and use, so that every yuan of working capital can play the greatest role in the cause of national construction.
    At present, an important part of strengthening working capital management and use in industrial enterprises is to focus on the work of verifying funds, and verifying funds must first do a good job in the enterprise's quota management. Quota management is the basis for enterprise economic accounting. Each enterprise should formulate unified and advanced quotas, such as labor-hour consumption quotas, raw material, material, and fuel consumption quotas, and establish and improve the necessary systems accordingly, such as purchasing, storage, material requisition, and accounting systems. Only by formulating reasonable quotas and having sound systems can the work of verifying funds have a foundation, and can the use of working capital not only ensure the normal needs of production turnover, but also avoid backlog and waste. In order to make the industrial working capital quota reasonable and advanced, each enterprise needs to conduct detailed research based on its own situation, cooperate with relevant departments, and fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and jointly do this work well from top to bottom and from bottom to top.
    Another important task closely related to strengthening the planned management of funds and verifying the working capital quota of enterprises is to actively clean up the warehouse materials of enterprises. Since April of this year, Liaoning Province has launched a warehouse cleaning campaign in industrial and commercial enterprises throughout the province, and unearthed a large number of stagnant materials, equipment, fuel and other important materials. Because the warehouse cleaning work was done well, a new situation of increased production and reduced bank loans has emerged. Before the warehouse cleaning, the average monthly increase in industrial loans in the province was 140 million yuan. By mid-June, the average loan amount had dropped by 56.4 million yuan. This situation fully shows that cleaning up warehouse materials is of great significance for strengthening the planned management of working capital and accelerating capital turnover. All places and units that have not yet carried out warehouse cleaning should conduct a thorough inventory in the near future.
    Commercial departments should also strengthen the planning of the use of working capital, and implement the quota management of working capital in a planned way. Commercial departments should further strengthen planning, improve the allocation and arrangement of goods, and further strengthen the quota management of goods in inventory, etc. Doing so can not only accelerate capital turnover and give full play to the effectiveness of commercial working capital, but also better meet market needs. As for the large number of goods sold on credit and the payment has not been recovered, a list should be drawn up and the payment should be recovered in one lump sum or in installments according to the actual situation. In the future, the business of selling goods on credit should generally be stopped, and when it is necessary to sell goods on credit (such as selling larger agricultural machinery to people's communes on credit), it also needs to be approved by a certain leading organ. If the payment has been made but the goods have not been seen, the production unit and the transportation department (goods in transit) should be urged to deliver the goods on time.
    The banking system must strengthen its understanding, inspection and supervision of the use of working capital, and frequently reflect the situation and problems in the use of working capital to the Party Committee and the enterprise's superior departments. For example, whether the increased loans from the bank have been diverted to capital construction, whether materials have been purchased, and whether there have been phenomena of sales on credit and advance payments. The banking sector must also frequently reflect the use and existing problems of raw materials allocated by the state plan to the Party Committee and relevant departments, and reflect the arrangement of commodity inventories between regions and existing problems. When carrying out these tasks, the banking sector must rely on the leadership of the Party Committee, rely on the masses, and strengthen cooperation with enterprises to jointly manage and use working capital well.
    The use and management of working capital is an important part of increasing production and practicing thrift. The effective and economical use of working capital will surely promote the development of production. At present, the people of the whole country are going all out to launch a new upsurge of the movement to increase production and practice thrift. Industrial and commercial enterprises should conduct a serious inspection and cleanup of the use of working capital in their units, clean up warehouses, strengthen working capital management, complete the work of verifying working capital quotas, deepen the movement to increase production and practice thrift, and create good results in saving working capital and increasing production to welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day!

    节约流动资金
    管好用好流动资金，是工商企业增产节约的重要内容之一，对增加生产，扩大流通，加速国家建设，有着十分重要的意义。
    流动资金在国家资金分配当中占有重要的地位。依据国民经济各部门在发展生产中对资金的需要，国家分别列有不同的资金项目，其中包括流动资金、固定资金等。这些资金虽然有共同性，如每一块钱都代表着一定的物资，但它们之间又有严格的区别。什么是流动资金呢？凡是在生产和流通领域内购买原料、材料、燃料和包装材料的费用，以及支付工资等，也就是一般只在一个生产周期内发生作用所需要的资金，都是流动资金。它在生产中周而复始，循环不断地保证生产和流转的正常进行。流动资金和固定资金一样，都是企业进行生产和商品周转所必不可少的资金。随着我国工农业生产和建设事业的迅速发展，国家每年都要增加大量的流动资金。
    正确地管理和使用流动资金，不仅仅对于促进企业实行经济核算，提高企业的生产和经营管理水平有十分重要的影响，而且对国家的资金和物资有计划的分配有重大的影响。我们知道，国家分给各企业的信贷资金是有计划的，也是有一定限度的。任何一个企业都不能毫无限制地向国家银行贷款。因此，企业对流动资金的使用，不但必须有计划，并且还要充分有效地发挥它的作用。生产部门的各个方面、各个环节都必须协调一致；那个方面、那个环节发生问题，都不能达到加速资金周转，有效地使用流动资金的目的。例如，一个企业生产的产品规格和质量不合要求，这看来是生产上的事情，但是这些规格质量不符合要求的产品如果销售不出去，积压了流动资金，而企业仍然要维持生产（如继续购进原材料、支付工资等），就必然会发生困难。又如，企业为了完成生产计划，就必须正确地制定各种定额和必要的制度。如果心中无数，在制品、半成品以及原材料储备的数量超过了正常周转的需要，同样也会造成流动资金的积压，因而对生产也是不利的。所有这些情况都说明流动资金的管理和使用，和企业生产的关系是十分密切的，同时也不难看出，流动资金的管理和使用问题是企业实行经济核算、增加生产和厉行节约的一个十分重要的内容。
    目前，企业单位流动资金的管理和使用的总情况是好的；但是也存在着一些问题。例如，今年上半年工业生产总值比去年同期增长很多，工业企业所需流动资金当然也要相应地有所增长，这是合理的；但是，个别企业流动资金的增加却超过了维持生产周转的正常需要。这一事实说明了这些单位在生产和经营管理上有不尽合理的地方。产生这种不正常的现象有一定的客观原因，如有些配件按照计划生产了，却由于某种客观原因而形成了积压。除此以外，也还有主观上的原因，如有的工厂动用流动资金进行基本建设，不根据实际需要大量采购原材料，产品试制还没有成功就大量采购物资，成批投入生产；在商业系统，有的单位库存商品不适合本地区、本单位经营的需要，等等。所有这些，都造成了流动资金的积压，而影响生产和商品的流通。对于以上这些情况，我们必须采取适当措施，加强流动资金管理和使用的计划性，使每一元流动资金，都能在国家建设事业中发挥最大的效用。
    当前，工业企业加强流动资金管理和使用的重要一环是抓好核定资金工作，而核定资金又必须首先搞好企业的定额管理。定额管理是企业经济核算的依据。每个企业都应当制定统一的、先进的定额，例如工时消耗定额，原料、材料、燃料消耗定额等等，并且相应地建立和健全必要的制度，例如采购、保管、领料、核算制度等等。只有制定出合理的定额，有了健全的制度，核定资金工作才有了基础，也才能使流动资金的使用既能保证生产周转的正常需要，又不至于积压和浪费。为了使工业流动资金定额做到既合理，又先进，各企业需要根据本身情况进行细致的研究，和有关部门共同协作，并且充分发动群众，依靠群众，自上而下和自下而上地把这一工作共同搞好。
    同加强资金的计划管理、核定企业流动资金定额有密切关系的另一件重要工作，是积极清理企业的仓库物资。辽宁省从今年4月份起在全省工商企业内开展了清仓运动，挖掘出大量的呆滞材料、设备、燃料等重要物资。由于清仓工作做得好，出现了生产增加，银行贷款减少的新局面。清仓以前，全省工业贷款每月平均增加一亿四千万元，到6月中旬，平均贷款数就下降了五千六百四十万元。这一情况充分说明，清理仓库物资对于加强流动资金的计划管理和加速资金周转是有十分重要的意义的。凡是到现在还没有进行清仓的地方和单位，都应该在最近进行一次彻底的清查。
    商业部门同样也要加强使用流动资金的计划性，并且要有步骤地实行流动资金的定额管理。商业部门应当进一步加强计划性，改进商品的调拨和摆布工作，并且在库存等方面进一步加强商品的定额管理。这样做不仅可以加速资金周转、充分发挥商业流动资金的效用，同时也可以更好地满足市场需要。至于赊销出大量商品而价款没有收回的，应当开列名单，根据实际情况，一次或分期收回价款。在今后，商品赊销业务一般应当停止，必须赊销时（如赊销给人民公社较大的农业机械），也需要经过一定的领导机关的批准。已经支付货款而没有见到商品的，应该督促生产单位和运输部门（在途商品）按时交货。
    银行系统必须加强对流动资金使用情况的了解、检查和监督，经常向党委和企业主管部门反映流动资金使用方面的情况和问题。例如银行增加的贷款是否挪用于基本建设，是否买进了物资，有没有发生赊销和预付货款的现象，等等。银行部门还必须经常向党委和有关部门反映国家计划分配的原材料使用情况和存在的问题，反映商品库存在地区之间的摆布情况和存在问题。银行部门在进行这些工作的时候，要依靠党委领导，依靠群众，加强同企业的协作，共同把流动资金管好和用好。
    流动资金的使用和管理是增产节约的重要内容之一，有效地和节约地使用流动资金，必将促进生产的发展。目前，全国人民正在鼓足干劲掀起增产节约运动的新高潮，工商企业单位应该对本单位流动资金的使用情况进行一次认真的检查和清理，清查仓库，加强流动资金管理，完成核定流动资金定额的工作，把增产节约运动深入一步，创造出节约流动资金增加生产的良好成绩，迎接伟大的国庆十周年！
