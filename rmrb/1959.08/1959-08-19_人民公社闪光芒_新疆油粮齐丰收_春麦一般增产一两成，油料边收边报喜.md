The People's Commune Shines
　　Xinjiang Reaps a Bumper Harvest of Oil and Grain
　　Spring Wheat Generally Increases Production by 10-20%, Oilseed Harvest Brings Repeated Good News
　　
    (Our newspaper Urumqi, August 18th) Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's more than 5.3 million mu of spring wheat has achieved a bumper harvest. Currently, the spring wheat in the Turpan Basin and southern Xinjiang has been completely harvested. The yield of spring wheat after threshing in many areas has generally increased by 10% to 20% compared to last year.

    Shanshan County, located in the eastern part of the Turpan Basin, has historically been a low-yield area for wheat. This year, the people's communes changed the past practice of generally not applying topdressing fertilizer to spring wheat. They also organized specialized teams to strengthen field management. As a result, the average yield per mu of more than 34,000 mu of spring wheat increased by more than 30% compared to last year. The people's communes in Hami Prefecture continuously overcame disasters such as rain, snow, floods, and aphids, and achieved a bumper harvest of more than 250,000 mu of spring wheat. The average yield per mu of more than 70,000 mu of spring wheat that has already been harvested in Hami County has increased by about 20% compared to last year.

    In the colder foothills of the Altai Mountains and along the Irtysh River, the communes are racing to harvest more than 700,000 mu of spring wheat. In order to seize the time and ensure a bumper harvest, the harvesting army has enthusiastically launched labor competitions.

    (Our newspaper Urumqi, August 18th) The more than 2 million mu of oil crops planted in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region this year are being harvested intensively, and good news of bumper harvests is constantly pouring in.

    The more than 30,000 mu of early flax in Shache County, south of the Tianshan Mountains, has been completely harvested, with the yield per mu generally increasing by more than 30% compared to last year. In the Dongfeng Commune of the Chabuqal Xibe Autonomous County on the banks of the Ili River, more than 1,000 mu has already been threshed and winnowed, with an average yield of 208 jin per mu, double that of last year. The more than 20,000 mu of oil crops in Hotan County, which has historically had very low yields, averaged 90 jin per mu. Currently, the battle to rush the harvest and transportation of oil crops continues intensely in the main oil crop producing areas along the Ili River and in Aksu Prefecture in southern Xinjiang.

    This year, the area sown with oil crops in the Autonomous Region has been expanded by 600,000 mu compared to last year. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of oil crops, the people's communes generally selected good land for planting oil crops, increased the application of base fertilizer, and strengthened mid-term and late-stage field management. During the tense wheat harvest season, counties in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture rationally arranged labor and strengthened early field management of oil crops, enabling more than 500,000 mu of oil crops to be watered, weeded, topdressed, and controlled for pests in a timely manner, thereby achieving a bumper harvest.

　　人民公社闪光芒
　　新疆油粮齐丰收
　　春麦一般增产一两成，油料边收边报喜
    本报乌鲁木齐18日电　新疆维吾尔自治区五百三十多万亩春小麦获得了丰收。现在，吐鲁番盆地和南疆各地的春小麦都已收完，许多地区收打完场的春麦产量，一般比去年增产一成到两成。
    位于吐鲁番盆地东部的鄯善县，是历年来的小麦低产区，今年各人民公社改变了过去春小麦普遍不施追肥的情况，还组织了专业队加强田间管理，因而三万四千多亩春小麦平均亩产量比去年增产三成以上。哈密专区各人民公社不断战胜雨雪、洪水和蚜虫等灾害，二十五万多亩春小麦获得丰收。哈密县已收打完的七万多亩春麦，平均亩产量比去年增产两成左右。
    气候较寒的阿尔泰山麓和额尔齐斯河两岸，各公社正在抢收七十多万亩春小麦。为了抢时间确保丰产丰收，收割大军热烈展开了劳动竞赛。
    本报乌鲁木齐18日电　新疆维吾尔自治区今年种植的二百多万亩油料作物，正在紧张收割，丰收喜讯不断传来。
    天山以南的莎车县三万多亩早胡麻，已全部割完，亩产普遍比去年增产三成以上。伊犁河畔的察布查尔锡伯族自治县东风公社，已经打完扬净一千多亩，平均亩产二百零八斤，比去年增加一倍。历来产量很低的和田县两万多亩油料作物，平均亩产九十斤。现在，抢收抢运油料作物的战斗，继续在伊犁河沿岸和南疆阿克苏专区等油料作物主要产区紧张进行。
    今年自治区油料作物的播种面积比去年扩大了六十万亩。各人民公社为了争取油料作物大丰收，普遍挑选好地种植油料作物，增施底肥，加强中期和后期田间管理。伊犁哈萨克族自治州各县在麦收紧张时期，合理安排劳力，加强油料作物的早期田间管理，使五十多万亩油料作物能适时浇水、除草、追肥和扑灭虫害，从而获得了丰收。
