    Nanchang, August 13th (Reported by this newspaper) – Jinxian County, Jiangxi Province, has achieved a series of extraordinary bumper harvests of spring and summer crops this year: the per mu yield of early rice on 360,000 mu of land throughout the county increased by 19.9% ​​compared to last year; the total output of 220,000 mu of wheat increased by 123.6% compared to last year; the total output of rapeseed increased by 70.7% compared to last year; the per mu yield of early soybeans increased by 94% compared to last year.
    The fact that Jinxian County has achieved a series of extraordinary bumper harvests in spring and summer agricultural production fully demonstrates the powerful vitality and unparalleled superiority of the People's Commune. The masses unanimously reflect: "The elementary cooperative is better than the mutual aid team, the advanced cooperative is stronger than the elementary cooperative, and the People's Commune is even stronger than the advanced cooperative. It is truly right to follow the Party."
    Recently, Jinxian County summarized the advantages shown by the People's Commune in production last winter and this spring, which further inspired the production enthusiasm of the members. These advantages are: 1. In the process of establishing People's Communes and consolidating and rectifying People's Communes, the vast number of members have received profound education and their socialist consciousness has been raised. When rushing to plant wheat last winter, a large part of the labor force went to make steel, but the members who remained on the agricultural front played a selfless spirit of labor, ensuring that the county's 220,000 mu of wheat completed the sowing task on time, in quantity, and with quality. 2. After the integration of government and commune, the Party's policies are easier to implement, and the promotion of various tasks is smoother than in the past, especially conducive to helping production teams with weak economic foundations develop production. Thanks to the assistance of the commune, the average yield of early rice in the county's 24 economically weak production brigades increased by more than 50% this year. 3. After the establishment of welfare undertakings such as public canteens and nurseries, more than 40,000 women in the county participated in agricultural production, which is a great force for developing production. 4. The commune unifies planning, rationally uses land, and improves the utilization rate of land. In the past, all advanced cooperatives had the task of planting cotton, and as a result, some land that was not suitable for planting cotton was also planted with cotton. After communization, a land adjustment was carried out, which not only eliminated more than 9,000 mu of interspersed fields, but also determined the types of crops to be planted according to the land properties. This year, 100,000 mu of cotton are planted in land suitable for cotton planting, so they are growing well. Because the land is in pieces and the crops are concentrated, it is easy to use water rationally and prevent and eliminate insects. 5. The commune can uniformly arrange and deploy labor within a larger scope, thus solving many problems that were difficult to solve in the past. For example, the county concentrated manpower and material resources, organized large-scale cooperation, and built four major lakes and port projects, which greatly improved the county's irrigation conditions. When planting wheat last winter, the county adjusted more than 5,000 laborers and more than 800 head of cattle to support each other, so that the county's wheat sowing not only seized the season, but also guaranteed the quality. 6. Commune-run industry has powerfully promoted the great development of agricultural production. In the past, the county had to purchase a large amount of lime from Pingxiang, Yichun and other places every year as fertilizer. After communization, lime factories were set up in communes and teams, burning their own lime to fertilize the fields and meet their own needs. At the same time, commune-run industry manufactured and repaired many new-style farm tools for agriculture.
    Now, the people of the county are full of joy, praising the goodness of the People's Commune, determined to further leverage the power of the People's Commune, to fight an even more beautiful battle in the second half of the year, and strive for a greater bumper harvest of autumn crops. The county has already vigorously launched the "three supers" and "two doublings" movement (late rice exceeds early rice, late soybeans exceed early soybeans, sesame exceeds wheat, cotton and sweet potatoes are doubled). The members said: The bumper harvest of early rice adds to the drive, and we strive for more than a thousand catties of late rice per mu. Sanli, Minhe, Sanyang, Qianxing, Luoxi and other communes have launched a large-scale late rice competition. In order to achieve a per mu yield of more than 1,000 catties of late rice, more than 400 members of the Qianfang Commune, with 100 head of cattle, marched to the low-yielding lake fields, camped in the lake fields, processed and fertilized, and rushed to transplant double-season late rice day and night. This year, the county's double-season rice planting area will be expanded to more than 250,000 mu, an increase of more than 70,000 mu compared to last year; more than 220,000 mu have now been transplanted.

　　进贤县农民喜庆春夏两季大丰收
　　争颂人民公社好得很
　　决心进一步发挥公社的威力，在下半年打个更漂亮的仗
    本报南昌13日电　江西进贤县今年春夏季农作物获得了一连串的特大丰收：全县三十六万亩早稻亩产比去年增产19.9％；二十二万亩小麦，总产量比去年增加123.6％；油菜总产量比去年增加70.7％；早大豆亩产比去年增加94％。
    进贤县春夏季农业生产连获特大丰收的事实，充分显示了人民公社的强大生命力和无比优越性。群众一致反映：“初级社比互助组好，高级社又比初级社强，人民公社比高级社更强。真是跟着党走，一点也没有错。”
    最近，进贤县总结了人民公社在去冬今春生产中所显示的优越性，进一步鼓舞了社员的生产积极性。这些优越性是：一、在建立人民公社和整顿、巩固人民公社的过程中，广大社员受到了深刻的教育，社会主义觉悟提高了。去冬抢种小麦时，很大一部分劳动力炼钢铁去了，但留在农业战线上的社员发挥了忘我的劳动精神，保证了全县二十二万亩小麦按质、按量、适时地完成播种任务。二、政社合一以后，党的各项政策更易于贯彻执行，对各项工作的推动也比过去更加顺利，特别是有利于帮助经济基础薄弱的生产队发展生产。全县二十四个经济基础薄弱的生产大队由于得到公社的援助，今年早稻平均增产五成以上。三、公共食堂、托儿所等福利事业办起来以后，全县有四万多名妇女参加农业生产，这是发展生产的一支很大的力量。四、公社统一规划，合理使用土地，提高了土地的利用率。过去各个高级社都有种棉花的任务，结果一些不适宜种棉花的土地也种上了棉花。公社化以后，进行了一次土地调整，不仅消灭了九千多亩插花田，而且根据土地性能确定了种植作物的种类。今年十万亩棉花都种在适宜种棉花的地里，因而生长良好。由于土地成片，作物集中，便于合理用水和防虫灭虫。五、公社能在较大的范围内统一安排和调度劳动力，因而解决了许多过去难以解决的问题。如全县集中人力物力，组织大协作，修建了四大湖、港工程，大大改善了全县的灌溉条件。去冬种小麦时，全县调剂了五千多劳动力和八百多头耕牛互相支援，使全县小麦播种既抓住了季节，又保证了质量。六、社办工业有力地促进了农业生产的大发展。过去全县每年都要向萍乡、宜春等地购进大批石灰做肥料。公社化后，社社队队都办起了石灰厂，自烧石灰肥田，满足了自己的需要。同时，社办工业为农业制造、修理了许多新式农具。
    现在，全县人民喜气洋洋，争颂人民公社好，决心进一步发挥人民公社的威力，在下半年打个更漂亮的仗，争取秋收作物获得更大丰收。全县已经轰轰烈烈地展开了“三超”“两加番”运动（晚稻超早稻，晚大豆超早大豆，芝麻超小麦，棉花、红薯加番）。社员们说：早稻丰收添干劲，力争晚稻超千斤。三里、民和、三阳、前型、罗溪等公社展开了晚稻千斤大竞赛。前坊公社为实现晚稻亩产超千斤，四百多名社员带着一百条耕牛远征低产的湖田，在湖田里安营扎寨，加工加肥，日夜抢栽二季晚稻。今年全县二季稻种植面积将扩大到二十五万多亩，比去年增加七万多亩；现在已栽秧二十二万多亩。
