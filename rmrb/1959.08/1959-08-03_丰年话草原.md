Talking About the Bumper Harvest on the Grassland
By Our Correspondent Mijidedaoerji

Inner Mongolian grassland herdsmen, through their hard work last winter and this spring, have achieved a great bumper harvest in animal husbandry production. On the vast pastures, herdsmen are beaming with joy as they see groups of fat lambs and foals. Those curious calves are even more adorable, sometimes butting heads and sometimes chasing each other on the pastures near the yurts. The grassland is a scene of a bumper harvest.

Joyful Pastures

In this bountiful summer, I came to the Daomudugobi People's Commune in the East Ujimqin Banner of the Xilingol League. The rich Ujimqin Banner grassland truly lives up to its reputation. On the lush summer pastures, the commune's herds can be seen everywhere, stretching as far as the eye can see; herdsmen on horseback crisscross the pastures near and far, as if the entire pasture is rejoicing. As we passed the summer camp of the Bayan Erhe Tu Brigade, a group of Mongolian men and women commune members, with colorful scarves tied around their heads and full of energy, were laughing, talking, and singing as they combed cashmere on the lawn. A commune member named Ulijie took out a handkerchief to wipe the sweat from his face and shouted, "Hey! Folks, the people's commune is powerful. This year, we have added a mountain to our pasture, a mountain called 'Wool Mountain.' Everyone, go up and take a look at the scenery of Jiangnan!" Commune members in charge of transportation are busy bundling the pure white cashmere and loading it onto trucks. Then, a long convoy heads towards the economic center of the grassland. The women are not to be outdone, rushing to milk the cows and then driving ox carts, carrying large buckets of fresh milk to the commune's milk powder factory. The girls delivering the milk said: The power of the people's commune is really great! Last year, when it was still an agricultural cooperative, the milk powder factory was small, producing only seven tons of milk powder; this year, with the bumper harvest of calves, the milk powder factory has also expanded, and the whole commune will produce fifty tons of milk powder and three tons of cream to support the country. The temporary transportation team is also extremely busy, driving batches of horses, cattle, and sheep selected by the commune members to the purchasing station. The commune members proudly told us that the people's commune has brought a bumper harvest, and they have decided to use more than 60,000 head of draught animals and edible cattle and sheep this year to support the construction of the motherland.

The Joy of Old Herdsmen

Since the establishment of the Daomudugobi People's Commune, the old herdsman Dangrubu has been filled with joy, and his enthusiasm has increased even more. In winter, he often rides his horse on the snowy pastures. In the spring, he is either busy with lambing or grazing sheep on the pastures. Late at night, he and the watchmen guard the sheep, fearing that the newborn lambs will freeze. The old man often says to himself, "Old man! You have to put in some effort. If you can't raise ninety-nine lambs out of every hundred ewes, you'll be letting down the Communist Party!"

Dangrubu is fifty-three years old this year, and his temples are already full of silver hair. Before liberation, he was a hired worker for more than twenty years and was still destitute. Now, everything has changed. The year before last, he protected the safety of more than five hundred sheep he was grazing in a particularly severe blizzard and was named a model worker, attending the autonomous region's labor model representative conference. Last year, he also received a labor model medal awarded by the autonomous region. After the establishment of the People's Commune, the old man couldn't sit still. One day, he told the Party branch secretary Dalingtai that since the commune was born, they should commemorate it well. Then, the old man told the branch secretary many things he had in mind, saying that he was willing to cultivate a large flock of high-yielding ewes for the commune. The commune gave Dangrubu five hundred ewes. From then on, whether it was a sunny day or a snowy night, the old man never left his flock.

One night, the snowstorm engulfed the entire pasture. More than a dozen young lambs were born in Dangrubu's flock, and the old man carried them one by one into the warm shed; but in those few minutes, three weak newborn lambs were frozen. The old man quickly carried these three lambs into the yurt and covered them with his fur robe. But the next day, the lambs still couldn't stand up, nor would they drink milk, and they were about to die. The old man held the lambs in his arms and fed them milk drop by drop, day and night. On the third day, the three lambs stood up, bleating softly.

Now, in Dangrubu's high-yielding ewe flock, there are only six barren ewes, and the remaining four hundred and ninety-four ewes have produced five hundred and nine young lambs, with only four dying from illness. On average, every hundred ewes produced one hundred and three lambs, and the old herdsman's wish has finally been realized.

The Miracle of the Gobi

Comrade Dejide, the secretary of the commune's Party committee, warmly received us. He said that half a year ago, when snowflakes were flying on the Gobi pasture, the Daomudugobi People's Commune was born. At that time, the commune had 733 households with more than 256,000 head of livestock, and the Mongolian commune members were overjoyed. This was because at the time of liberation, the entire East Ujimqin Banner had no more than 300,000 head of livestock. After the commune was established, the commune members immediately threw themselves into the intense battle of livestock wintering and spring grazing. Snowy days followed one after another, but the commune members' enthusiasm grew day by day, and the livestock were in much better condition than in previous years. Soon, the snowy season on the grassland passed, and the first good news after communization came out: the loss of various livestock in the whole commune decreased by 80% compared with the same period last year.

Spring came to the grassland, and the first animal husbandry harvest season of the Daomudugobi People's Commune began.

The first batch of ewes in the commune gave birth to lambs, which were high-quality improved lambs never seen before on the Gobi pasture. The busy lambing work lasted for more than forty days and nights. The warm sheds and warm circles that were empty at the beginning of the year were already full of thousands upon thousands of young lambs. The commune members of the Daomudugobi People's Commune delivered more than 85,000 young animals this year, more than 20,000 more than last year, and the survival rate of young animals reached 93%, nearly 10% higher than last year. The older generation of herdsmen said that they had never seen such a bumper harvest year, which is a miracle on the Gobi pasture.

Now, the number of livestock in the Daomudugobi People's Commune has increased to more than 340,000 head, with an average of more than ninety-two head of livestock, large and small, per person in the whole commune. Due to the great bumper harvest in animal husbandry, the income of the commune members will increase by about 8% compared with last year, and each worker can earn about 500 yuan on average.

When we finished our visit and left the commune, it was already very late, and in the pastures near and far, the lights held by the watchmen were shining.

    丰年话草原
    本报记者　密吉德道尔基
    内蒙古草原牧民，经过去冬今春的辛勤劳动，畜牧业生产得到了大丰收。辽阔的牧场上，牧人们看到一群群肥胖的羊羔和马驹，高兴得眉开眼笑。那些好奇的牛犊，更是逗人喜爱，在蒙古包附近的牧场上，有时低头顶架，有时互相追逐。草原上是一片丰收景象。
    欢乐的牧场
    在这丰收的夏天，记者来到了锡林郭勒盟东乌珠穆沁旗道姆都戈比人民公社。富绕的乌珠穆沁旗草原真是名不虚传。绿油油的夏季牧场上，处处是公社的畜群，随着视线的伸展，一直伸延到天边；远远近近的牧场上，骑马的牧民穿来穿去，好像整个牧场都在欢腾。当我们路过巴音额尔贺图大队的夏营地时，一群群蒙古族男女社员，头扎彩巾，个个精神奋发，又是说笑又是唱的在草坪上抓羊绒。一个叫乌力吉的社员拿出手巾擦去脸上的汗珠喊道：“喂！乡亲们，人民公社威力大，今年咱们牧场上增加了一座山，这山叫‘羊毛山’，大家上去望望江南风光吧！”担任运输的社员，忙着把洁白的绒毛捆包装车。接着，长长的车队，奔向了草原经济中心。妇女们更不示弱，挤完奶就赶着牛车，把一大桶一大桶的鲜牛奶送到公社的乳粉厂。送奶的姑娘们说：人民公社的力量真大啊！去年牧业社时，乳粉厂小，只生产了七吨乳粉；今年牛犊丰收，乳粉厂也扩大了，全社要生产五十吨乳粉和三吨奶油支援国家。临时组织起来的赶运组也格外繁忙，他们把社员挑选好的马牛羊，一批一批的赶到收购站去。社员们自豪地告诉我们，人民公社带来了丰收，他们决定今年用六万多头耕畜和食用牛羊，支援祖国的建设。
          老牧民的喜悦
    道姆都戈比人民公社建立起来以后，老牧民当如布心里甜滋滋的，干劲更足了。冬季里，他经常骑着马出没在风雪弥漫的牧场上。春天，他整天不是忙着接羔，就是到牧场上放羊，到了深夜，他还和打更的社员守着羊群，生怕夜里生的小羊羔冻坏了。老人常常自言自语地说：“老头！可得要使把劲儿呀，每百头母羊身上保育不出九十九只羔，你可就对不起共产党啊！”
    当如布今年五十三岁了，双鬓已经挂满了银丝。解放前他当过二十多年的雇工，还是个一无所有的人。现在，一切都变化了。前年，他在特大的暴风雪里，保卫了自己放牧的五百多只羊的安全，被大家评为劳动模范，出席了自治区劳模代表大会。去年，他又获得了自治区颁发的劳动模范奖章。人民公社成立以后，老人更坐不住了。一天，他向党支部书记达林泰说，公社诞生了，我们应该好好地纪念它。接着，老人把心里想的许多话告诉了支部书记，说他愿意为公社培育一个大群丰产的母羊群。公社交给了当如布五百只母羊。从那时起，不论是晴朗的日子还是风雪的夜晚，老人一天也不肯离开他的羊群。
    一天夜里，风雪淹没了整个牧场。当如布的羊群里生了十多只幼羔，老人一个个地往暖棚里抱；但就在这几分钟内，三只体弱的初生羔冻着了。老人赶忙把这三只羔抱进蒙古包里，盖上自己的皮袍。可是第二天，幼羔还是站不起来，也不吃奶，眼看就要死了。老人就把幼羔抱在怀里，往幼羔的嘴里一点一滴的喂牛奶，这样又过了一天一夜。第三天上，三只幼羔咪咪的叫着站了起来。
    现在，当如布培育的丰产母羊群里，只有六只空怀，其余四百九十四只母羊产了五百零九只幼羔，病死的只有四只。平均每百只母羊产一百零三只仔畜，老牧人的愿望终于实现了。
          戈比的奇迹
    公社党委书记德吉得同志热情地接待了我们。他说，半年前戈比的牧场上雪花纷飞的时候，道姆都戈比人民公社就诞生了。那时全社七百三十三户社员，有二十五万六千多头牲畜，蒙古族社员高兴得心里开了花。因为解放时，全东乌珠穆沁旗的牲畜，也不过三十万头。公社建立起来了，社员们立刻投入了牲畜过冬度春的紧张战斗。风雪的日子一个接着一个，社员们的干劲却一天比一天高涨，畜膘也都比往年好得多。不久，草原上的风雪季节过去了，公社化后的第一个捷报传出来了：全社各种牲畜的损失，比去年同期减少了80％。
    春天来到了草原上，道姆都戈比人民公社的第一个畜牧业收获季节开始了。
    公社的第一批母羊产了羔，这是戈比牧场上从来没有过的优良种改良羊羔。繁忙的接羔工作，整整连续了四十多个昼夜。年初还是空着的暖棚暖圈，已经被成千成万的幼羔挤得满满的了。道姆都戈比人民公社的社员们，今年接下了八万五千多头仔畜，比去年多接了两万多头，幼畜的成活率达到93％，比去年提高了将近10％。老一代牧民们说，从来没见到过这样的丰收年，这是戈比牧场上的奇迹。
    现在，道姆都戈比人民公社的牲畜已经增长到三十四万多头，全社平均每人有大小牲畜九十二头多。由于畜牧业的大丰收，社员们的收入要比去年增加8％左右，平均每个劳动力可以获得五百元左右。
    当我们结束了访问离开公社的时候，天已经很晚了，远远近近的牧场上，正闪耀着打更社员们掌的灯光。
