Exert Full Effort, Strengthen Measures, and Fight Against Drought
Shaanxi Youth Farmers Strive for a Bumper Autumn Grain Harvest

Xi'an, August 19th (This newspaper) – In carrying out the high-yield field campaign, the youth of Shaanxi Province have become a tremendous force. According to recent statistics, over 1.5 million young people across the province are participating in autumn high-yield field experiments. They have organized more than 100,000 youth high-yield teams (groups), cultivating various crops on more than 1.49 million mu of land. Judging from the recent inspections of high-yield fields by the Communist Youth League committees at all levels in northern Shaanxi, the growth of corn, millet, sorghum, broomcorn millet, cotton, and potatoes in high-yield fields is better than in previous years. In the Guanzhong area and other places, youth high-yield fields for cotton, corn, and rice have received more meticulous irrigation, fertilization, and field management than in previous years.

Since Comrade Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, proposed at a symposium with youth of the Fenghuo Production Team of the Fenghuo People's Commune in Qian County after the summer harvest to earnestly summarize the experience of this year's high-yield wheat and continue to exert full effort to vigorously promote the autumn high-yield field campaign, young people throughout the province have universally studied this instruction, actively participated in summarizing the experience of high-yield wheat, reversed the slack mood of some people, and launched an autumn high-yield field campaign.

This year, most areas of Shaanxi Province, except for northern Shaanxi and a small number of counties in southern Shaanxi and Guanzhong, have suffered from drought. In order to seize a bumper autumn harvest, the vast number of rural youth enthusiastically participated in the fight against the disaster. Young people built canals and dug wells during the day, and carried water for point irrigation at night, fully demonstrating a spirit of fighting without fear of difficulties. In order to overcome the drought and ensure a bumper harvest in autumn high-yield fields, young people in various places launched competitions, putting forward the bold slogan "We must have a bumper harvest whether it rains or not, and we must have a bumper harvest even in drought." Rural youth in Tongchuan City searched for water sources everywhere, built canals, and used them as they were built. According to statistics from more than 1,200 youth teams (groups) in Fuping, Liuqu, Liulin, and Xiaoqiu communes in the city, they dug 88 springs and built 16 canals in late July, irrigating more than 18,000 mu of autumn fields. Among them, the 27.4 mu of high-yield corn and 37.5 mu of high-yield cotton in the Jiefang Youth Farm of Fuping Commune were irrigated more than twice.

In the competition, young people in various places both fought drought and increased high-yield measures, strengthening the management of high-yield fields. According to investigations in Tongchuan, Xianyang, Xingping, Dali, and other counties and cities, weeding, pest control, and fertilization have been increased by one to two times compared to the original, and the number of cultivations has also increased. The dryland high-yield cotton in the production team of the Yeshan Commune in Dali County has reached a height of five chi per plant, with more than 20 old bolls per plant, because the youth production team used point irrigation to fight drought and increased the number of cultivations to preserve soil moisture.

Young people in various places have been studying agricultural production technology very seriously during the autumn high-yield campaign. Some communes have established agricultural technical schools for young people, hiring agricultural technicians or experienced old farmers as teachers to give regular lessons to youth high-yield teams (groups). Each youth high-yield team (group) in the Sishilipu Commune of Suide County hired teachers, learning whatever they did. For example, when fertilizing, they studied the relationship between various fertilizers and soil, fertilizer crops, and fertilization methods. In their studies, they focused on summarizing past high-yield experiences in order to apply these experiences more rationally. Through study, the operating techniques of each youth high-yield team (group) in this commune have generally improved. For example, when irrigating high-yield cornfields, they adopted the methods of irrigating in the morning and evening, irrigating frequently with small amounts of water, and irrigating with ditches to reduce evaporation.

Many youth high-yield teams (groups) have also created many new production experiences during the autumn high-yield campaign. For example, the Sanchawan Youth High-Yield Team of the Chengguan Commune in Yulin County created a "ditch-to-ridge" corn cultivation method. The local summer winds are strong, and in the past, the introduction of improved varieties such as Golden Queen corn resulted in reduced yields due to lodging every year because the stalks were tall and the cobs were large. The "ditch-to-ridge" method involves sowing corn in ditches more than eight cun deep, with the seedlings growing in the ditches until the corn enters the jointing stage, at which point the ditches are filled and the soil is hilled (five to six cun high). The benefit of this method is that it protects the seedlings from wind and sand during the seedling stage and increases the root system during the jointing stage (two more circles of roots than the general planting method), effectively preventing lodging. Now, the 19 mu of corn planted by this youth high-yield team using this method has more than 3,000 plants per mu, with stalks more than one zhang tall and leaves three cun wide, with an average of two to three cobs per plant. This production team also created "ridge-planted potatoes" to prevent mold and rot in the summer. (Zhu Bo)

    鼓足干劲　加强措施　奋战干旱
    陕西青年农民力争秋粮丰产
    本报西安19日电　在开展丰产田运动中，陕西省青年成为一支巨大的力量。据最近的统计，全省参加秋季丰产田试验的共有一百五十多万青年。他们组织了十万多个青年丰产队（组），在一百四十九万多亩土地上培植了各种作物。从陕北各级团委最近对丰产田检查的情况来看，玉米、谷子、高粱、糜子、棉花、马铃薯等丰产田生长情况都比往年好。关中等地的棉花、玉米、水稻等青年丰产田，在灌溉、施肥和田间管理上都比往年细致。
    自从陕西省委第一书记张德生同志夏收后在乾县烽火公社烽火生产队青年座谈会上，提出要认真总结今年小麦丰产经验，继续鼓足干劲，大搞秋田丰产运动以后，全省各地青年普遍学习了这个指示，积极参加总结小麦丰产经验，扭转了部分人中的松劲情绪，掀起了秋田丰产运动。
    今年，陕西省除了陕北地区和陕南、关中少数县以外，大部分地区都遭受了旱灾，广大农村青年为了夺取秋田丰产，热情参加了抗灾斗争。青年们白天修渠打井，黑夜担水点浇，充分显示了不畏难的战斗精神。为了战胜旱灾，保证秋季丰产田丰收，各地青年纷纷发起竞赛，提出“天下雨要丰收，天旱也要丰收”的豪迈口号。铜川市农村青年到处寻找水源，修水渠，随修随用。据该市富平、流曲、柳林、小丘等公社的一千二百多个青年队（组）的统计，7月下旬共挖出泉水八十八眼，修渠十六条，灌溉秋田一万八千多亩。其中富平公社解放青年农场的二十七亩四分丰产玉米，三十七亩半丰产棉花，都浇水两次以上。
    各地青年在竞赛中，都是一方面抗旱，一方面增加丰产措施，加强对丰产田的管理。据铜川、咸阳、兴平、大荔等县、市的调查，锄草、防虫、施肥都比原来增加一遍到二遍，中耕次数也增加了。大荔县业善公社生产队的旱地丰产棉花，由于青年生产队利用点浇的办法抗旱，同时增加了中耕保墒的次数，现在棉花株高五尺，每株都有二十多个老桃。
    各地青年在秋季丰产运动中，都十分认真学习农业生产技术。有些公社为青年们建立了农业技术学校，聘请农业技师或有经验的老农担任教师，定期的为青年丰产队（组）上课。绥德县四十里铺公社的各青年丰产队（组）都聘请了老师，做什么学什么。如施肥时就学习各种肥料和土壤的关系，肥料作物和施肥的方法等。他们在学习中着重总结过去丰产的经验，以便更合理地运用这些经验。这个公社的各个青年丰产队（组）经过学习，作业技术普遍提高了。如灌溉丰产玉米地就采取了早晚灌、小水勤灌、开沟灌的办法，以减少蒸发量。
    许多青年丰产队（组）在秋季丰产运动中还创造了很多新的生产经验。如榆林县城关公社三岔湾青年丰产队创造了“以沟变垅”的玉米栽培方法。当地夏季风大，过去引种金皇后玉米等良种，由于秆高棒大，年年倒伏减产。“以沟变垅”的作法就是把玉米播种在八寸多深的沟里，幼苗一直在沟内生长，等到玉米进入拔节期，就把沟填平，然后培土（培五、六寸高的土）。这种方法好处是可以保护幼苗期不受风沙之害，并且在拔节期增加根群（比一般的种法多两圈根群），有效地防止了倒伏。现在这个青年丰产队用这种方法播种的十九亩玉米，每亩有三千多株，秆高一丈以上，叶子有三寸宽，平均每株都有二个至三个棒。这个生产队还创造了“垅种马铃薯”，可以防止夏季发生霉烂现象。　（朱波）
