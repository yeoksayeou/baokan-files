Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: Significant results have been achieved in the restoration and development of handicraft production in most provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country. Currently, the variety and quantity of handicraft products in these regions are continuously increasing, quality has improved somewhat, seasonal goods are already flowing onto the market, and most small commodities that were once out of stock have resumed production. The repair service industry is also expanding its service scope and adding new service items.

In the second quarter of this year, especially since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a conference on non-staple food and handicraft production in large and medium-sized cities in Shanghai, party committees at all levels have generally strengthened their leadership over handicraft production and have taken measures such as returning personnel to their posts, placing master craftsmen in position, establishing institutions, and supplying raw materials, enabling handicraft production to recover and develop rapidly. In restoring handicraft production, all localities have first focused on restoring and developing the production of small commodities and seasonal goods most closely related to the people's lives. Zhejiang Province, where work has progressed relatively quickly, has increased the variety of handicraft products from 1,033 in March to approximately 2,000. The production of daily necessities and famous brand products urgently needed by the masses has increased significantly. The output of products such as Tiantai chopsticks, silk umbrellas, scissors, net baskets, paper fans, feather fans, lace, and crepe has reached or exceeded the level of the same period last year. The famous Zhang Xiaoquan scissors produced 165,000 pairs in June, an increase of 50% compared to May. Product quality has also improved, such as the first-class product rate of Pingyang umbrellas, which has increased from 93% to 99.6%. By the end of June, the four cities of Nanning, Wuzhou, Liuzhou, and Guilin in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and the Guilin Prefecture, had restored and developed the production of 1,140 types of daily necessities and small hardware items. Handicraft products needed by people of all ethnic groups in the summer, such as bath tubs, wooden basins, bamboo chairs, umbrellas, straw hats, and rattan sun hats, have been continuously supplied to the market. The Shantou Prefecture in Guangdong Province, which has always been developed in handicrafts, has now restored and newly added more than 3,700 types of handicraft products. In Jieyang County, the production of 27 products such as towels, sandals, straw mats, and paper umbrellas has exceeded the original production level. In the first half of this year, Beijing produced more than 2 million pieces of small daily-use hardware, with zipper production increasing by 27% compared to the same period last year and shoe eye production increasing by 70%.

During the busy summer harvest and planting season, handicraft departments in various regions have vigorously restored and developed the production of small farm tools. From mid-June to mid-July, Zhejiang Province manufactured a total of 3.15 million small farm tools and repaired more than 6.8 million. The handicraft department of Linqing City in Shandong Province, based on the needs of agricultural production, first expanded the production of 47 types of small farm tools such as sickles, hoes, and cultivating hoes. In the past two months, the city has produced more than 758,000 pieces of various agricultural machinery parts and small farm tools, and has also sent people to the countryside to repair more than 43,000 farm tools.

The handicraft repair service industry has also developed significantly in many regions. According to statistics from thirteen prefectures, counties, and cities in Jiangsu Province, the number of repair service points in June doubled compared to May. The "eight trades" (referring to coppersmiths, shoemakers, barrel makers, umbrella repairers, etc.) which have always been popular among residents in Hangzhou, have resumed their businesses, shouting along the streets and providing door-to-door services. Shops and handicraft cooperatives in Beijing have generally established repair outlets, and many commodities that could not be repaired in the past are now being repaired.

The key to such a large recovery and development of handicraft production in just over two months lies in the strengthened leadership of party committees at all levels, tight work, and concrete and effective measures. At present, most provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country have restored handicraft management institutions. Many prefectures, counties, and cities have also established handicraft management institutions and have assigned full-time staff. Some cadres with experience in handicraft work have also successively returned to their original positions. Many handicraft workers who had been transferred to other units have returned to their teams. They enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party, expressing their determination to restore and develop handicraft production as soon as possible.

Properly solving the problem of raw material supply is another important link that has enabled the rapid development of handicraft production. In addition to relying on the state to allocate a portion of raw materials, handicraft departments in various regions, under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels, have strengthened cooperation with commercial and agricultural departments, fully mobilized the masses, and adopted methods such as clearing warehouses, linking up with large factories, holding material exchange meetings for small local and special products, making full use of waste products and scraps, mutually adjusting surpluses and deficiencies, and striving for processing with supplied materials to solve the difficulties of insufficient raw materials in every possible way.

Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: The All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives issued instructions on the 13th, requesting handicraft cooperative enterprises across the country to vigorously grasp August and September, actively carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and produce more and better handicraft products to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

The instructions said that although the variety of handicraft products has recovered relatively quickly, the quantity and quality of the products still cannot meet the growing needs of society. The peak season of autumn harvest, autumn planting, and the autumn market is approaching. The broad masses of people need more daily-use industrial products and agricultural means of production. Therefore, all localities must further strengthen their leadership over handicraft production, resolutely oppose the slackening thoughts and right-leaning sentiments of a small number of cadres, strive to overcome weak links, continue to exert great effort, vigorously grasp August and September, and launch a vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy in all handicraft enterprises to produce more and better handicraft products.

The instructions stated that in order to further restore and develop handicrafts, the following work must be done at present:

(1) It is necessary to quickly establish and improve the special management institutions for handicrafts and actively organize the return of cadres to their teams. All localities should conduct a serious inspection of the establishment of institutions and the return of personnel to their teams. Institutions that have been established should be strengthened, and those that have not yet been established should be established quickly.

(2) It is necessary to organize handicraft production in a down-to-earth manner and try every possible means to solve the difficulties of raw materials and materials. In production arrangements, further specific plans should be made for autumn production; production plans should be implemented in a timely manner to grassroots enterprises, and tasks should be implemented in a timely manner to members and workers. In the supply of raw materials, we must resolutely implement the principle of combining state support with self-reliance, and take various effective measures to increase income and reduce expenditure, actively tap the potential of local materials, and use all raw materials and waste materials that can be used for handicraft production as much as possible and in a timely manner.

(3) While vigorously increasing the production of handicraft products and varieties, we must strive to improve the quality of products, so that quantity and quality are equally important, and we must achieve both high output and high quality. It is necessary to strengthen technical management, stipulate product quality standards, establish and improve product inspection systems and necessary reward and punishment systems; vigorously improve the technical level of members and workers, especially new workers and apprentices. At the same time, the service quality of the repair service industry should also be continuously improved.

(4) We must continue to carry forward the fine tradition of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives in the original handicraft cooperatives, improve enterprise management, do a good job in economic accounting, carry out mass technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and continuously improve labor productivity. Grassroots enterprises should establish quota management systems as much as possible, resolutely implement the socialist principle of "distribution according to work," strive to improve tool equipment, reduce the consumption of raw materials and materials, reduce all non-production expenditures, and make full use of all manpower, material resources, and financial resources to do a good job in production.

    党委加强领导措施具体有力手工业生产迅速恢复发展
    产品品种和数量不断增加　当令商品已源源上市
    手工业合作总社号召大抓八九两月生产供应秋后旺季需要
    据新华社15日讯　全国大部分省、市、自治区恢复和发展手工业生产获得了显著效果。目前这些地区手工业产品的品种和数量正在不断增加，质量有所提高，当令商品已经源源上市，一些一度脱销的小商品大部分恢复了生产；修理服务行业也正在扩大服务范围和增加新的服务项目。
    今年第二季度，特别是中共中央在上海召开大中城市副食品和手工业生产会议以来，各地党委普遍加强了对手工业生产的领导，采取了人员归队、师傅就位、成立机构、供应原料等措施，使手工业生产迅速恢复发展起来。各地在恢复手工业生产时，首先注意恢复、发展与人民生活关系最密切的小商品和当令商品的生产。工作进展较快的浙江省，目前手工业产品的品种，已由3月份的一千零三十三种增加到二千种左右，群众迫切需要的日用小商品和名牌产品大量增加，天竺筷、绸伞、剪刀、网篮、纸扇、羽毛扇、花边、绉纱等产品产量已达到或超过了去年同期的水平，著名的张小泉剪刀6月份生产了十六万五千把，比5月份增产50％；产品质量也有所提高，如平阳雨伞的正品率由93％提高到99.6％。广西僮族自治区的南宁、梧州、柳州、桂林四个市和桂林专区截至6月底已有一千一百四十种日用百货、小五金恢复和发展了生产，各族人民夏天需用的浴桶、木盆、竹椅、雨伞、草帽、藤太阳帽等手工业产品，已经源源地供应市场。广东省手工业一向发达的汕头专区，目前已经恢复和新增加的手工业产品达三千七百多种，揭阳县的毛巾、凉鞋、草席、纸伞等二十七种产品都已超过了原有的生产水平。北京市今年上半年生产日用小五金二百多万件，其中拉锁产量比去年同期增长27％，鞋眼产量增长70％。
    在繁忙的夏收夏种季节，各地手工业部门都大力恢复与发展小农具生产。浙江省从6月中旬至7月中旬，共制造小农具三百十五万件，修配小农具六百八十多万件；山东临清市的手工业部门根据农业生产的需要，首先扩大了镰刀、锄头、耕锄等四十七种小农具的生产，近两个月来，全市已生产各种农业机械配件和小农具七十五万八千多件，还派人下乡修配各种农具四万三千多件。
    手工业修理服务行业在不少地区也有较大的发展。据江苏省十三个专区、县、市的统计，6月份的修理服务点比5月份增加了一倍。杭州市一向为居民喜爱的“用八担”（即铜匠担、修鞋担、箍桶担、修伞担等）都已恢复业务，沿街叫喊，登门服务。北京市的商店和手工业社普遍设立修理门市部，许多过去无处修理的商品现在都有人整修。
    手工业生产在短短两个多月内有了这样大的恢复与发展，关键在于各级党委加强了领导，工作抓得紧，措施具体有力。目前全国大部分省、市、自治区已经恢复了手工业管理机构，许多专、县、市也设置了手工业专管机构，配备了专职工作人员，一些具有手工业工作经验的干部也陆续回到原来的工作岗位。不少地区原来转业到其它单位工作的手工业工人纷纷归队。他们热烈响应党的号召，表示一定要尽快地把手工业生产恢复发展起来。
    妥善解决原材料供应问题，是使手工业生产得以迅速发展的另一重要环节。各地手工业部门除依靠国家调拨一部分原材料以外，还在各级党委的统一领导下，与商业、农业部门加强了协作，充分发动群众，采取清理仓库、和大工厂挂钩、举办小土特产品的物资交流会、充分利用废品和下脚料、互相调剂有无、争取来料加工等办法，千方百计地解决原料不足的困难。
    据新华社15日讯　中华全国手工业合作总社13日发出指示，要求全国手工业合作企业，大抓8、9两个月，积极开展增产节约运动，生产更多、更好的手工业产品，迎接国庆十周年。
    指示说，目前各地手工业产品品种虽然恢复得较快，但是产品的数量和质量还不能满足社会日益增长的需要。秋收秋种和秋后市场的旺季转眼即到，广大人民需要更多的日用工业品和农业生产资料。因此各地必须进一步加强对手工业生产的领导，坚决反对一小部分干部中的松劲思想和右倾情绪，努力克服薄弱环节，继续鼓足干劲，大抓8、9两个月，在所有手工业企业中，开展一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，生产更多更好的手工业产品。
    指示说，为了进一步恢复和发展手工业，当前必须做好以下的工作：
    （一）必须迅速建立和健全手工业的专管机构，积极组织干部归队。各地对于机构建立和人员归队的情况，应当进行一次认真的检查，机构已经建立的要加强，尚未建立的要赶快建立。
    （二）必须脚踏实地地组织手工业生产，千方百计地解决原料和材料的困难。在生产安排上，应当进一步对秋季生产作出具体规划；生产计划要及时落实到基层企业，任务要及时贯彻到社员、职工中去。在原料材料供应上，应当坚决贯彻国家支援和自力更生相结合的方针，要采取各种行之有效的办法，开源节流，积极挖掘地方物资潜力，把一切能用于手工业生产的原料材料和废物料，尽量地、及时地使用起来。
    （三）在大力增产手工业产品和品种的同时，必须努力提高产品的质量，做到产量质量并重，既要高产，还要优质。必须加强技术管理，规定产品质量标准，建立和健全产品检验制度和必要的奖惩制度；大力提高社员、职工特别是新工人和学徒的技术水平。与此同时，修理服务业的服务质量也应当不断提高。
    （四）必须继续发扬原有手工业合作社勤俭办社的优良传统，改进企业管理，搞好经济核算，开展群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，不断提高劳动生产率。基层企业应当尽可能建立定额管理制度，坚决贯彻“按劳分配”的社会主义原则，努力改进工具设备，降低原料和材料的消耗，紧缩一切非生产开支，充分利用一切人力、物力和财力，搞好生产。
