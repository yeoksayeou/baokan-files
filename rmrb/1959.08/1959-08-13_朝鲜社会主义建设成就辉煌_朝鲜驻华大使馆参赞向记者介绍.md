Xinhua News Agency, August 12th: As the Korean people's national holiday – "August 15th" Liberation Day – approaches, Ma Dongshan, Counselor of the DPRK Embassy in China, introduced the brilliant achievements of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in various fields to Chinese and foreign reporters at a press conference held at the embassy this afternoon.

Counselor Ma Dongshan said that under the wise leadership of the Workers' Party and the government headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, the Korean people have demonstrated high political enthusiasm and unparalleled heroic spirit, and on the basis of the post-war three-year recovery and construction, have launched a vigorous upsurge in socialist construction to complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule and exceeding targets.

When discussing agricultural production and livestock production, Counselor Ma Dongshan said that North Korea's grain production has increased year by year. In 1957, grain output was equal to 132% of that before liberation, and the grain planned to be produced this year will be much more than in 1957. In terms of livestock production, each person will receive 40 kilograms of meat and 46 kilograms of milk per year within two or three years. Other undertakings such as culture, education, and health have also achieved great development. Counselor Ma Dongshan pointed out that the assistance and support of proletarian internationalism from socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is one of the basic factors for the Korean people's achievements.

Counselor Ma Dongshan finally said that the glorious achievements of socialist construction in the northern half of the Republic and the powerful force of the socialist camp have greatly encouraged the people of South Korea. In order to force the US imperialist aggressor troops to withdraw from South Korea, and to peacefully reunify the motherland and free themselves from countless sufferings and misfortunes, the people of South Korea are now more determined than ever to fight against US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee gang.

　　朝鲜社会主义建设成就辉煌
　　朝鲜驻华大使馆参赞向记者介绍
    据新华社12日讯　朝鲜人民的全民节日——“八·一五”解放纪念日即将来临，朝鲜驻华大使馆参赞马东山今天下午在大使馆举行的记者招待会上，向中外记者介绍了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在各方面获得的辉煌成就。
    马东山参赞说，朝鲜人民在以金日成首相为首的劳动党和政府的英明领导下，发挥了高度的政治热情和无比的英雄精神，在战后三年恢复建设的基础上，为提前超额完成第一个五年计划，掀起了轰轰烈烈的社会主义建设高潮。
    在谈到农业生产和畜产品生产时，马东山参赞说，朝鲜粮食生产逐年增加，1957年的粮食产量等于解放前的132％，而今年计划生产的粮食将比1957年多出很多；畜产品生产方面，在两三年内，每人每年将会得到四十公斤肉类和四十六公斤牛奶。其它如文教、卫生事业也获得了巨大的发展。马东山参赞指出，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国无产阶级国际主义的帮助和支援，是朝鲜人民取得这些成就的基本因素之一。
    马东山参赞最后说，共和国北半部人民取得的社会主义建设的光辉成就和社会主义阵营的强大威力，大大鼓舞了南朝鲜人民。南朝鲜人民为了使美帝国主义侵略军撤出南朝鲜，为了和平统一祖国，使自己从无数痛苦和不幸中解脱出来，现在比任何时候都更坚决地为反对美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮进行斗争。
