    Surpassing Mother
    Huang Bingzhong

    In many kindergartens in Luoyang City, a "Surpassing Mother" campaign is currently underway. Mothers naturally show meticulous care for their children, but our childcare workers aim to surpass mothers, which is truly admirable and touching.

    Let's examine how mothers love and care for their children: from the moment the child is conceived, they try every means to protect them, ensuring suitable conditions for growth. After the child is born, even more aspects require attention. Mothers are constantly concerned about everything related to the child's physical and mental development, including food, clothing, housing, and more. Without this care, the growth of a child is unimaginable.

    However, in the old society, people viewed this care very narrowly, believing that only biological mothers could provide it, and no one else could.

    Our era is different. With the advancement of socialist construction, the widespread establishment of nurseries and kindergartens has relieved women, who were bound by heavy housework for thousands of years, of a great burden. Many of them have taken on different jobs. Nurseries and kindergartens share the responsibility of raising children with them.

    This raises a question: Can children be raised well? Can children in kindergartens receive the same care as when raised by individual mothers?

    On the surface, the slogan "Surpassing Mother" may seem overly demanding and impractical. However, upon careful analysis, it becomes clear that it is entirely achievable. In the past, mothers, despite their eagerness to care for their children, were often unable to do everything perfectly due to the burden of life and housework. For example, adjusting the child's clothing several times a day according to temperature changes, ensuring the child eats well, sleeps well, plays well, maintains good hygiene, and stays healthy, while also ensuring good education, is relatively difficult to achieve comprehensively in a typical household. However, in our kindergartens, it is entirely possible, and many kindergartens have already achieved it.

    Some may argue that all these are superficial things, and the mother's heart in caring for her child cannot be surpassed. This is not necessarily true. Some mothers are overly indulgent, raising their children in a greenhouse, shielding them from wind, frost, heat, and cold, resulting in delicate and weak children. Our childcare workers certainly do not need to surpass this kind of mother's heart; the vast majority of mothers in our society and our era do not want them to do so either. If we define caring for children as ensuring their healthy physical and mental development, then we can proudly say that our current childcare workers, with their unparalleled love for our descendants and successors, and a high sense of responsibility to the thousands of mothers in the country, will care for the children even more thoughtfully. This heart is purer and nobler than the hearts of ordinary mothers. It transcends the narrow confines of "raising children for old age," without favoritism, without expecting returns, and without conditions.

    How precious is the "Surpassing Mother" heart of our esteemed childcare workers! May our childcare workers all strive to "Surpass Mother," and truly surpass mothers!

### 赛过妈妈

    赛过妈妈
    黄秉忠
    洛阳市很多幼儿园里，现在正热烈开展“赛妈妈”活动。妈妈之对于儿女，自然是关怀备至的，我们的保育工作者，却要赛过妈妈，这的确使人钦佩而且感动了。
    看一看妈妈是怎样爱护儿女的吧：从儿女怀在肚子里起，就想方设法备加保护，让他有适宜的条件成长。儿女生下以后，需要照顾的方面更多了，吃的、穿的、住的等一切与儿女身心健康发展有关的方面，妈妈们都要时刻关心。如果没有这种关心人的成长就难以想像了。
    但是，在旧社会里，人们把这种关心看得非常狭隘，认为只有亲生妈妈才能这样，别的任何人是做不到的。
    我们的时代不同了。随着社会主义建设的向前发展，托儿所、幼儿园的普遍举办，被繁重的家务劳动束缚了几千年的妇女，松了一口大气，她们很多人走上了不同的工作岗位。托儿所、幼儿园为她们分担了培育孩子的责任。
    这就随着提出了一个问题：孩子能不能抚育好？孩子在幼儿园里，能不能得到像单个妈妈抚育时同样的关照呢？
    从表面看来，“赛妈妈”这一口号，似乎有些要求过高，不够落实。但是，如果仔细分析一下，就会认定是完全可以实现的。过去母亲抚育孩子，尽管爱护心切，但是，由于生活负担和家务的拖累，对于儿女的关照，有时难免力不从心。例如，根据气温的变化，每天给孩子几次增减衣服，既要保证孩子吃好、睡好、玩好、卫生好、身体好，又要保证教养好，这在一般家庭中，倒是比较难全面做到的。在我们的幼儿园里，却完全可以做到，很多幼儿园早已做到了。
    或许有人会说：所有这些，都是表面的东西，妈妈们关照孩子的那颗心，却是无法赛过的。这也不一定。有些妈妈对于孩子过分溺爱，整天把孩子养在温室里，不让他经风霜，历寒暑，结果孩子娇生惯养，弱不禁风。这种妈妈的心，我们的保育工作者，当然是不必去赛过；我们的社会，我们时代的绝大多数妈妈，也不希望她们这样做。如果把对孩子的关照，确定为保证孩子们身心的健康成长，那么，我们就可以自豪地说：我们今天的保育工作者，她们会以对我们的后代和接班人的无比热爱，对祖国成千上万个妈妈的高度责任心，把孩子们关照得更为周到。这颗心，比一般妈妈们的心更纯正，高尚。它跳出了“养儿防老”的狭隘天地，没有偏爱，不期报偿，不讲条件。
    可贵的保育工作者们的这颗“赛妈妈”之心！但愿我们的保育工作者都来“赛妈妈”，真正地赛过妈妈！
