The sixth postwar steel strike in the United States has entered its sixth week. The strike struggle is sharp and far-reaching, and is a major event in the current domestic class struggle in the United States.

	The Course of the Strike

On June 30, the three-year labor-management contract (1956-59) of the American steel industry expired. As early as May 5, labor and management began negotiating a new contract. The negotiations between the United Steelworkers of America on one side and twelve major steel companies on the other lasted for seventy days.

In the negotiations, the labor side's main demands were: (1) An increase in wages of approximately 10%, or 30 cents per hour; (2) Companies to pay all worker insurance premiums (currently, workers pay a portion); (3) Reduced working hours to 38 hours per week, with 32 hours every fourth week, but paid at the 40-hour rate, to expand employment; (4) Increased unemployment benefits, pensions, and improved hospitalization and medical insurance.

The management categorically rejected the workers' demands, proposing to extend the original contract for one year, and to cancel the clauses in the original contract that automatically adjusted wages based on price increases or productivity improvements, which would effectively freeze wages for a year. After the workers rejected this unreasonable demand, the management issued an ultimatum, ordering the workers to respond within twenty-four hours, or they would close the factories and lay off a large number of workers.

Under the intervention of U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, negotiations were extended for two weeks, from July 1 to 14, after the contract expired, but still yielded no results. As a result, 500,000 steelworkers launched a nationwide strike on July 15.

	Sharp Class Struggle

This steel strike is a class struggle that U.S. monopoly capital had prepared for a long time and deliberately provoked; monopoly capitalists attempted to use this to attack the Steelworkers Union and frustrate the rising worker movement since the elections last autumn. To deal with this strike, U.S. monopoly capital had made preparations long in advance. Before the contract expired, steel users such as automobile and electrical machinery companies frantically purchased steel, while steel companies went into full swing and stepped up production, bringing the steel industry's operating rate to over 90%. Thanks to this arrangement, steel monopoly capital earned excess profits in the first half of this year, increasing from $287.7 million last year to $694.6 million in the first half of this year, an increase of nearly 150%. Currently, U.S. steel users have stockpiled 24 million tons of steel, enough to meet three months of needs. It is estimated that major users will not be short of steel before September or October. This relieves the pressure on the management from the users' side.

At the same time, the management promoted the idea that wage increases would stimulate prices, leading to inflation. They attempted to exploit the American people's fear of inflation to gain public opinion support, attack the workers' strike, and create excuses for raising steel prices after the strike. This is an outright lie. Because, as everyone knows, American steelworkers' wages have only increased twelve times since the war, while steel prices have increased more than twenty-three times.

In this strike, the steel companies not only attempted to economically suppress workers' treatment, but more importantly, attempted to politically destroy the union. U.S. Steel Corporation Vice President Cooper (chief representative of the twelve steel companies) openly stated that the management's goal was to completely destroy the United Steelworkers Union. "The New York Times" said: The steel companies have determined that the power of the United Steelworkers Union is too great, or that the power it demands is too great, so it is not so much that the company refuses to increase monetary benefits, but rather that it wants to weaken this power.

The eight-point plan proposed by the management in the negotiations required workers to completely submit to the management's arbitrariness in terms of working conditions, production, labor intensity, wages, and benefits. That is to say, the management can increase the intensity of workers' labor without union restrictions, impose unwarranted punishments on workers, and let workers come to work or stop working without prior notice... This approach is essentially an attempt to deprive the union of its rights, undermine collective bargaining between labor and management, and restore workers to the past "open shop" era (factories are "open" to everyone, and non-union members can also work in the factory, with the aim of undermining the union's role in the factory), allowing the management to do as it pleases.

The American steel industry is a pivotal industrial sector, and American steelworkers have always been at the forefront of the labor movement. Therefore, the current practice of U.S. monopoly capital is to first attack steelworkers in order to achieve the goal of "killing one to warn a hundred" and affecting the entire labor movement.

The steel companies' offensive has the support of the entire U.S. monopoly group and its government. The Eisenhower administration and congressional leaders of both parties have long stated that wage increases should be stopped to curb price increases, creating public opinion sympathetic to the steel companies.

Senator Kennedy is also actively campaigning to have Congress pass legislation restricting union activities. On July 23, the U.S. House Labor Committee passed a bill restricting and controlling union activities. On August 8, Eisenhower also delivered a speech calling for the enactment of federal laws to restrict union activities. These are all closely related to the current steel strike.

Of course, the most serious blow facing workers is government intervention under the Taft-Hartley Act. So far, the U.S. government has not taken this approach. However, facts tell us that in the five previous steel strikes after the war, the government intervened four times. Under the Taft-Hartley Act, the president can order workers to stop striking for eighty days in the name of endangering national security; if labor-management disputes are still not resolved after eighty days, the president can consult with Congress to take mandatory action.

	The Arduous Struggle of American Workers

The fact that this steel strike could be realized demonstrates the rising fighting spirit of American steelworkers. Without the strong pressure from the grassroots, the right-wing leaders of the Steelworkers Union would not have taken strike action. Before the strike, David McDonald, President of the United Steelworkers of America, had met with Eisenhower, Nixon, members of Congress, and the chairman of the American Iron and Steel Institute. McDonald tried to seek compromise and even concealed the negotiation situation. He lowered the workers' demand to 15 cents per hour and accepted government mediation, agreeing to extend the contract for two weeks. However, he could not suppress the workers' fighting spirit.

During the strike, 500,000 steelworkers could not get paid, losing as much as $50 million in wages every week. Living without money and food for a long time is not easy, but the workers still went on strike.

The AFL-CIO has stated that its member unions will fully support the steelworkers' struggle. The United Automobile Workers, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union have all guaranteed to give full support to the Steelworkers Union.

The Communist Party USA attaches great importance to this steel strike. On July 26, it issued a statement calling on the working people to fully support the steelworkers' strike struggle and condemning the Eisenhower administration for helping capitalists attack workers. Comrade William Z. Foster, Honorary Chairman of the CPUSA, also issued a statement calling on American workers to unite and resolutely strive for the final victory of the steelworkers' strike. Comrade Foster emphasized that this strike is not limited to an ordinary union strike, but more importantly, it has political significance.

	The Impact of the Steel Strike

The steel strike directly affects U.S. steel production first and foremost. This strike covers twelve major steel companies, whose output accounts for approximately 88% of U.S. national steel production. According to materials from the American Iron and Steel Institute, steel production in the first week of August was only 332,000 tons, equivalent to 11.7% of production capacity. It is generally estimated that due to the strike, steel companies will produce two million tons less steel each week, losing $30 million in net profit.

Recently, according to figures released by the U.S. government, the steel strike has caused the industrial production index for July to fall from 155 (with 1947 to 1949 as 100) in June to 153. Other industries such as coal, rail transport, construction, and machinery are already threatened. It is estimated that the number of railroad workers, truck drivers, miners, and sailors who need to stop work immediately due to the steel strike is more than 25,000. The total number of other industrial workers who need to stop work is over 100,000. According to the British "Times" report, the U.S. steel strike has affected the U.S. economy. The U.S. rail freight volume, daily necessities, and automobile sales have begun to decline. This is causing the U.S. ruling class a great headache.

The steel strike will also affect the labor movement in other industries in the United States. Many manufacturing industries are waiting for the outcome of the steelworkers' struggle as a "guide" for their labor-management negotiations. The labor-management contracts of the three largest aluminum companies in the United States, which employ 31,500 workers, expired on July 31. On August 6, the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers announced that if the new contract proposal put forward by the labor side is rejected by the management, 45,000 workers in the copper and other industries will go on strike on August 20.

This steel strike will inevitably affect the future U.S. labor movement. If the strike is victorious, the worker movement that has been unfolding since last autumn will develop further; if the strike is intervened by the government and fails, American workers will learn this lesson, break their illusions about the Democratic Party (which has ostensibly supported workers in the past), and more actively carry out the independent political struggle of the workers.

Currently, labor-management negotiations in the steel industry remain deadlocked, with no progress. The struggle of American steelworkers will be a complex and arduous process, with far-reaching significance for improving the political consciousness and combat effectiveness of the American working class.

　　美国钢铁工人的罢工斗争
　　梅逸
    战后美国第六次钢铁大罢工已进入第六周。罢工斗争尖锐，影响深远，是当前美国国内阶级斗争中的一件重大事件。
          罢工的经过
    6月30日，美国钢铁工业为期三年（1956—59）的劳资合同期满。早在5月5日，劳资双方就开始谈判新的合同。以联合钢铁工人工会为一方和十二家大钢铁公司为另一方的谈判进行了七十天之久。
    在谈判中，劳方的主要要求是：（1）提高工资大约10％，即每小时提高三角；（2）由公司缴付全部工人保险费（现在一部分保险费系由工人缴付）；（3）减少工作时间，每周三十八小时，每逢第四周三十二小时，但按四十小时付工资，以扩大就业；（4）增加失业补助金、养老金，改善住院医药保险。
    资方断然拒绝了工人的要求，提出延长原合同一年，取消原合同中规定的随物价上涨或生产率提高而自动调整工资的条款，这实际上就是冻结工资一年。在工人拒绝这种无理要求之后，资方又下最后通牒，限令工人在二十四小时内答复，否则将关厂和解雇大批工人。
    在美国总统艾森豪威尔的干预下，谈判在合同期满后，从7月1日至14日，延长了两周，但是，仍然没有任何结果。于是，五十万钢铁工人在7月15日掀起了全国性的大罢工。
      尖锐的阶级斗争
    这次钢铁罢工是美国垄断资本准备已久并蓄意激起的一场阶级斗争；垄断资本家企图借此打击钢铁工会和挫折去秋选举以来日渐高涨的整个工人运动。为了对付这次罢工，美国垄断资本早就作了准备。在合同期满之前，汽车、电气机械等用钢户就拚命抢购钢材，钢铁公司则开足马力，加紧生产，使钢铁工业的开工率达到90％以上。由于这种安排，钢铁垄断资本今年上半年获得了超额利润，从去年的二亿八千七百万美元增加到今年上半年的六亿九千四百六十万美元，增加了近一倍半。目前美国钢铁用户已经储备了二千四百万吨钢材，足供三个月的需要。估计，主要用户在9、10月前不会缺钢。这就使资方摆脱来自用户方面的压力。
    与此同时，资方又宣传所谓工资上升会刺激物价，以致引起通货膨胀。他们企图利用美国人民害怕通货膨胀的心理，争取舆论支持，打击工人罢工，并为在罢工后提高钢价制造借口。这是一种彻头彻尾的谎话。因为，人们都知道，战后美国钢铁工人的工资只增加了十二次，钢价却提高过二十三次。
    在这次罢工中，钢铁公司不仅企图在经济上压低工人待遇，而更重要的是企图在政治上整垮工会。美国钢铁公司副经理库柏（十二家钢铁公司的首席代表），公开声称资方的目的在于彻底摧毁美国钢铁工会。“纽约时报”说：钢铁公司已经认定，美国钢铁工人工会的权力太大了，或者是它所要求的权力太大了，因此，与其说公司拒绝增加金钱方面的福利，还不如说是要削弱这种权力。
    资方在谈判中所提出的八点计划要求工人在工作条件、生产、劳动强度、工资福利等方面完全屈从于资方的独断。也就是说，资方可以加强工人劳动强度而不受工会限制，对工人施加毫无理由的惩罚，不必事先通知工人而让工人来工作或者停止工作……。这种做法实质上是企图剥夺工会的权利，破坏劳资之间的集体谈判，使工人回复到过去“开厂”时期（工厂对所有的人都“开放”，非工会会员也可入厂作工，目的是打击工会在工厂中的作用）听任资方摆布的境地。
    美国钢铁工业是举足轻重的工业部门，美国钢铁工人又一贯站在工人运动的前列。因此，美国垄断资本目前的做法是企图首先打击钢铁工人，以达到“杀一儆百”，影响整个工人运动的目的。
    钢铁公司这次的进攻得到整个美国垄断集团及其政府的支持。艾森豪威尔政府和国会两党领袖，长期以来都表示，应该停止增加工资以制止物价上涨，制造同情钢铁公司的舆论。
    参议员肯尼迪还积极活动，要求国会通过限制工会活动的法案。7月23日美国众院劳工委员会已经通过了一项限制和控制工会活动的法案。8月8日艾森豪威尔也发表演说，要求制定联邦法律限制工会活动。这些都是同当前的钢铁罢工密切相关的。
    当然，工人面临的最严重的打击还是政府根据塔夫脱—哈特莱法进行干涉。到现在为止，美国政府还没有采取这种做法。但是，事实告诉我们，在战后的前五次钢铁罢工中，政府就有四次进行干涉。根据塔夫脱—哈特莱法，总统可以危及国家安全为名，下令工人停止罢工八十天；在八十天后劳资纠纷如仍未解决，总统可商请国会采取强制解决的行动。
    美国工人的艰苦奋斗
    这次钢铁罢工能够实现，表现出美国钢铁工人高涨的斗志。如果没有下层群众的强大压力，钢铁工会的右翼领导是不可能采取罢工的行动的。在罢工之前，美国联合钢铁工人工会主席麦克唐纳曾先后同艾森豪威尔、尼克松、国会议员和美国钢铁公司董事长进行会谈。麦克唐纳力图谋求妥协，甚至隐瞒谈判情况。他把工人的要求降低为每小时增加工资一角五分，而且接受了政府的调解，同意延长合同两周。但是，他并不能够压抑工人的斗志。
    在罢工中，五十万钢铁工人拿不到工资，每星期要损失工薪五千万美元之多。长期没有钱和粮食的日子是不好过的，但是，工人还是进行了罢工。
    劳联—产联已经表示它的会员工会将全力支持钢铁工人的斗争。联合汽车工人工会、美国国际汽车司机兄弟会、国际码头与仓库工人工会都保证给予钢铁工会全力支持。
    美国共产党十分重视这次钢铁罢工。7月26日，它发表了一项声明，号召劳动人民全力支持钢铁工人的罢工斗争，并谴责艾森豪威尔政府帮助资本家进攻工人。美共名誉主席福斯特同志也发表声明，号召美国工人团结一致，坚决争取钢铁工人罢工的最后胜利。福斯特同志强调指出，这次罢工不限于是一次普通的工会罢工，重要的是它具有政治意义。
      钢铁罢工的影响
    钢铁罢工首先直接影响美国的钢铁生产。这次罢工遍及十二个主要钢铁公司，它们的产量约占美国全国钢铁生产的88％。据美国钢铁研究所的材料，8月初第一周的钢铁产量只有三十三万二千吨，相当于生产能力的11.7％。一般估计，由于罢工，钢铁公司每周要少产钢铁二百万吨，损失纯利润三千万美元。
    最近，据美国官方发表的数字，钢铁罢工已经使7月份的工业生产指数从6月份的一五五（以1947年到1949年为一百）下降到一五三。其他行业，如煤业、铁路运输业、建筑业、机器业等等已经受到威胁。估计由于钢铁罢工而需要立即停工的铁路工人、卡车司机、矿工和海员就在二万五千人以上。而需要停工的其他工业工人总人数达十万人以上。据英国“泰晤士报”报道，美国钢铁罢工已影响美国经济。美国的铁路载运量、日用品和汽车销售量等已开始下降。这就使美国统治阶级大伤脑筋。
    钢铁罢工还要影响美国其他工业的工人运动。许多制造业都在等待钢铁工人斗争的结果作为他们劳资谈判的“指南”。雇有三万一千五百工人的美国最大的三家制铝公司，劳资合同在7月31日期满。8月6日，美国国际采矿、冶炼工人工会宣布，如果劳方提出的新合同草案遭到资方拒绝，四万五千名铜业和其他行业的工人将在8月20日开始罢工。
    这次钢铁罢工势将影响今后的美国工人运动。如果罢工胜利，去秋以来日益展开的工人运动将有进一步的发展；如果罢工遭到政府的干预而失败，美国工人将接受这次教训，打破对民主党的幻想（过去民主党表面上支持工人），而更加积极地进行工人的独立的政治斗争。
    目前，钢铁业的劳资谈判仍处于僵持状态，没有任何进展。美国钢铁工人的斗争将是一个复杂和艰苦的过程，对美国工人阶级的政治觉悟和战斗力的提高具有深远的意义。（附图片）
