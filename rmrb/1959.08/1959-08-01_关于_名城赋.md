Editorial Notes:

    "Ode to Famous Cities" is one of the new columns opened by the supplement to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day. It aims to reflect the changes, new appearances, and deep feelings in the lives of our country's famous cities. The changes in the motherland in the past ten years have been great and multifaceted. What is reflected in this column is only a part of them, but from the perspective of the country's economic and cultural construction, it cannot but be an important part. We hope it can gain the support of readers and authors.

    The articles published in this column attempt to use prose to express the changes and life of various famous cities from various angles and aspects through colorful writing. It can be as powerful as a political commentary, or as profound and delicate as a lyric poem; it can be as gorgeous and colorful as a Han and Wei rhapsody, or as fresh and timeless as a Tang and Song travelogue. It is not required to write about all aspects of each city comprehensively, but it is necessary to express the author's most familiar life and personal feelings. We hope that in this column, readers will not only deeply see the new appearances of various famous cities, thus hearing the footsteps of the motherland's progress, but also read many refined, rich, and moving prose pieces that reflect the features of our times.

    关于“名城赋”
    “名城赋”是副刊为了迎接国庆十周年所辟的新栏目之一，想通过它来反映我们祖国各个著名城市的变化、新的面貌以及生活当中的深切的感受。十年来祖国的变化是伟大的，而且是多方面的，在这个栏目中所反映的只是其中的一部分，但是从全国的经济、文化建设的意义来说，不能不是重要的一部分。我们希望它能够获得读者和作者们的支持。
    在这个栏目里发表的文章，企图用散文的形式，通过多彩的笔调，从各个角度、各个方面抒写各个著名城市的变化和生活。它可以像政论那样气势磅礴，也可以像抒情诗那样深刻细腻，它可以像汉魏辞赋那样绚烂多彩，也可以像唐宋游记那样清新隽永。不要求对各个城市都写得很全面，但需要根据作者最熟悉的生活和切身的感受进行抒写。我们希望在这一栏里，读者不仅能够深切地看到各个著名城市的新姿，从而听到了祖国前进的脚步声，同时也读到许多反映我们这个时代风貌的精炼、丰富、动人的散文。　（编者）
