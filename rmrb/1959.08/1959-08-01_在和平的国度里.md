    In a Peaceful Country
    By Chen Yongjin, Staff Reporter

    The train heading south sped past Pingxiang, through Friendship Pass, and from our peaceful country into another peaceful country—the fraternal Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    The train raced through that beautiful river valley for a short time before entering the boundless plains. Everywhere were evenly spaced and lush rice paddies. In many places, the harvest had already begun. How touching these golden plains were!

    But when we settled into the "Reunification Hotel" in Hanoi, Vietnamese comrades told us that the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem's radio station was saying: "The people in the North are starving, and the South cannot bear the hunger of the Northern people and are willing to transport Saigon rice." "The rice in the North has decreased in production due to close planting."
    "..."

    This cannot help but remind one of an experience we Chinese gained from the struggle against the enemy: "We can only understand what all reactionaries say from the opposite perspective."

    On a sweltering night, Comrade Chen Youyi, Minister of Rural Work of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, spoke to us with great excitement about many issues in Vietnamese rural work. He said that they are confident that this year's rice production will reach six million tons. Based on the current rice harvesting situation, it may reach six million four hundred thousand tons. While in 1958 it was only four million five hundred thousand tons. The rice in the North is particularly good this year, not because the weather is good, on the contrary, this year's drought is unprecedented in many years. It hadn't rained for six consecutive months after transplanting the rice seedlings. Under such severe conditions, under the active leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the Vietnamese people organized and built many water conservancy projects. Women, the elderly, and even the people's beloved leader, President Ho Chi Minh, went to the fields to fight the drought. This excellent rice can be said to have been ripened by the sweat of the Vietnamese people. The era of hunger for the Vietnamese people is over, and now the average person has more than four hundred kilograms of rice. Comrade Chen Zao, Deputy Secretary of the Hai Duong Provincial Party Committee, told us that last year the average person in Hai Duong Province had 445 kilograms of rice, and more than 500 kilograms with miscellaneous grains. Who can Ngo Dinh Diem's group's lies about "Northern people starving" deceive?

    One of the important measures to increase rice production this year is rational close planting, which is recognized by both state workers and ordinary farmers. During our days in Vietnam, we went to many places, and the rice paddies were all rationally and closely planted. Responsible comrades from Nam Dinh Province told us that in the past, in their rice paddies, a wide space could be left to put a conical hat between one rice plant and another. At that time, only 1,250 kilograms of early rice could be harvested per hectare. As a result of close planting, deep plowing, and increased fertilization, this year's rice can yield 2,550 kilograms per hectare, and late rice will yield 3,500 kilograms. This is the result of their close planting. This heavily slapped the face of Ngo Dinh Diem's group's rumors!

    We had the opportunity to visit the heroic troops of the Vietnamese People's Army. Here, the soldiers are indeed engaged in combat, but it is a battle against nature. One morning, we departed from the Phu Tho Tea Factory, took a jeep northwest, passed through dense groves of sunflowers, and crossed two small rivers. Suddenly, we saw red flags fluttering in the air, and the soldiers welcomed us in a spacious courtyard. Everything here was so orderly. Nguyen Trinh, the young director of the regimental political department, introduced us to their production situation in this mountainous area. When they were ordered to produce here in May last year, this area of ​​mountains and forests was still a world inhabited by tigers, leopards, and wild boars. When they first arrived, they didn't even have houses, so they built houses while reclaiming wasteland. The leadership asked them to reclaim 65 hectares of wasteland in a month and a half, but the task for a month and a half was overfulfilled in half a month. We climbed to a mountain ridge to visit their tea fields, and the tea seedlings were growing very vigorously. The soldiers said that in the past, some people said that tea could not be grown here, but we grew it. Some people said that tea could not be grown in winter, but the tea we planted in winter also grew very well. In the garrisons of the People's Army, there are many tea gardens and coffee plantations that they have just opened up, as well as gardens for planting grains and fruits, and livestock farms, fish ponds, and so on. All of this shows that the soldiers of the People's Army not only have experience in fighting the enemy, but also have rich production experience.

    As long as you walk on the land of Vietnam, you can understand why the Vietnamese people so strongly need to develop their industry. During the nearly 100 years of French imperialist rule in Vietnam, there was only one cement factory and one textile factory worthy of the name of modern industry. They built cement factories to build more bunkers, fortifications, and beautiful private residences for their enjoyment. The textile factory was the property of a large French consortium, and he only came once a year to collect the interest and leave.

    This time visiting Vietnam, we not only saw these two factories left by French imperialism, but also saw more newly built factories. In Hanoi, we visited the newly built match factory and timber factory. Experts from Czechoslovakia are working with workers to study how to improve quality. In Hanoi, we also visited the medium-sized machine tool factory, which was built with the help of the Soviet Union. According to the situation in Vietnam, they adopted the method of building and producing at the same time. Last year alone, they produced 200 machine tools, and this year they will produce 400 machine tools. In the newly established Dong Xuan Knitting Factory, we saw Chinese experts who came here with the friendship of the Chinese people to impart technology to Vietnamese brothers. Comrade Di Longxin, a Chinese expert, excitedly told us: The technical level of Vietnamese workers has improved rapidly. According to the design, these machines will not reach the design quota until one year later. But in less than half a year, they exceeded the design quota. They learn quickly and do well. This peaceful and prosperous scene of unity and active construction in North Vietnam is in stark contrast to South Vietnam, ruled by Ngo Dinh Diem south of the 17th parallel. With the assistance of his American masters, Ngo Dinh Diem sent planes to bomb peaceful rural areas in the South because the residents here said that the Labor Party was good and that President Ho Chi Minh was good. For the same reason, a large number of Southern people were arrested and shot. Grain yields have fallen from more than 2,000 kilograms per hectare before the war to 1,200 kilograms per hectare. However, the Ngo Dinh Diem group says every day that a great famine has occurred in North Vietnam, close planting has reduced production, and they are launching a war.

    Will anyone believe this?

    在和平的国度里
    本报记者　陈勇进
    南去的列车驰过凭祥，穿过睦南关，就从我们的和平国度到了另一个和平的国度——兄弟之邦的越南民主共和国。
    列车在那秀丽的河谷地带奔驰了不久，就进入了无边的平原。到处是均匀而丰盛的稻田。不少地方已经开镰收割。这样金色的平原，该是多么动人！
    可是当我们在河内的“统一饭店”住下来的时候，越南的同志告诉我们，南越吴庭艳的广播电台却说：“北方的人民在饥饿中，南方不忍北方人民的饥饿，愿把西贡的大米运来。”“北方的稻谷，由于密植而减产了。”
      “……”。
    这里就不能不使人想起我们中国人从对敌斗争中得到的一句经验谈：“一切反动派说的话，我们只有从反面来认识。”
    在一个酷热的夜里，越南劳动党中央农村工作部长陈友翼同志，怀着极大的兴奋向我们谈了越南农村工作的许多问题。他说，今年稻谷的产量六百万吨是有把握的。按现在谷子收割的情况，可能达到六百四十万吨。而1958年才是四百五十万吨。今年北方的稻谷特别好，并不是因为风调雨顺，相反，今年的旱灾是很多年来所没有的。插秧以后连着六个月没有下雨。在这样严重的情况下，越南人民在劳动党的积极领导下，组织起来，修了很多水利工程，妇女、老人，连人民敬爱的领袖胡志明主席都下田抗旱。这么好的谷子，可以说是越南人民用汗浇熟的。越南人民的饥饿的年代已经过去了，现在平均每人有四百多公斤谷子。海阳省委副书记陈造同志告诉我们，去年海阳省平均每人有稻四百四十五公斤，加上杂粮就有五百多公斤。吴庭艳集团散布的什么“北方人民在饥饿中”的鬼话，能骗得了谁呢？
    今年稻谷增产的重要措施之一是合理密植，不管国家的工作人员或普通的农民都这样认识。在越南的日子里，我们走了很多地方，稻田都进行了合理密植。南定省的负责同志告诉我们，过去在他们的稻田里，这棵稻子和那棵稻子之间，可以宽宽荡荡地放下个斗笠。那时候，每公顷的早稻才收到一千二百五十公斤。密植加深耕和多施肥的结果，今年的稻子每公顷可以收到二千五百五十公斤，晚稻要收到三千五百公斤。这就是他们密植的结果。这就重重地打了吴庭艳集团的造谣的嘴巴！
    我们曾有机会访问越南人民军的英雄部队。这里，战士们确实在进行着战斗，但那是向大自然进行的战斗。一天上午，我们从富寿茶厂出发，坐吉普车往西北走，穿过了稠密的葵树林子，又过了两条小河，突然看见空中红旗飘扬，战士们在宽敞的庭院里欢迎我们。这里的一切都那么有秩序。年轻的团政治部主任阮贞向我们介绍了他们在这带山区生产的情形。去年5月间他们奉命到这里生产时，这带山林还是老虎、豹子、野猪出没的世界。刚来时，连房子也没有，他们是一面盖房子又一面开荒。领导上要他们在一个半月内开荒六十五公顷，可是一个半月的任务在半个月里就超额完成了。我们爬到一个山岭上，参观他们的茶田，茶苗长得非常茁壮。战士们说，过去有人说这里不能种茶，我们种出来了。有人说冬季不能种茶，我们在冬天种的茶也长得很好。在人民军的驻地，有很多他们才开的茶园、咖啡园，有栽种谷物、果木的园地，还有牲畜场、鱼塘等等。这一切都说明人民军的战士们不仅有打击敌人的经验，还有丰富的生产经验。
    只要在越南的土地上走过，就可以知道越南人民为什么那样强烈地需要发展自己的工业。原来法帝国主义在越南统治的近百年中，像样的现代工业只有一个水泥厂和一个纺织厂。他们建立水泥厂是为了修筑更多的碉堡、工事和供他们享受的漂亮的私人住宅。纺织厂是法国一个大财阀的财产，每年他只来一次，收了利钱就走。
    这一次访问越南，我们不仅看到这两个法帝国主义留下来的工厂，还看到更多新兴建的工厂。在河内，我们访问了新建的火柴厂、木材厂。捷克斯洛伐克的专家正和工人们一起研究如何提高质量的问题。在河内，我们还访问了中型机床厂，这是苏联帮助建设的。根据越南的情况，他们采用了一边建设一边生产的办法，仅去年就生产了二百台机床，今年要生产四百台机床。在不久前才建立起来的冬春针织厂里，我们看到了中国的专家，他们带着中国人民的友情来这里，把技术传授给越南的兄弟们。中国专家狄龙新同志兴奋地告诉我们：越南工人的技术水平提高得很快。按照设计，这些机器在一年以后才能达到设计定额。可是在不到半年的时间里，就超过设计的定额了。他们学得快做得好。在越南北方这种万众一心积极建设的和平繁荣景象，和十七度以南的吴庭艳所统治的南越比起来，该是多么鲜明的对照。吴庭艳在美国主子协助下，出动飞机轰炸南方和平的农村，原因是这里的居民说劳动党好，说胡志明主席好。因为同样的原因，大批的南方人民被逮捕、枪杀。谷物的产量由战前的每公顷二千多公斤，降低到每公顷一千二百公斤。但是，吴庭艳集团却天天说北越发生了大饥荒，密植减产了，正在发动战争。
    这难道会有人相信吗？
