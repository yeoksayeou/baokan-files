　　Seizing the Opportunity to Purchase Native Products
　　Chongqing Commercial Personnel Use Their Brains to Improve Procurement Methods in Various Ways
　　Fujian Rosin, Tung Oil, Dried Bamboo Shoots, etc. Show Significant Increase in Purchase Volume

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 11th: Currently, it is the peak season for rural native products to be on the market. Chongqing's commercial departments are making every effort to improve procurement work to facilitate farmers' sales of products.

80% of the raw materials needed for daily-use industrial products in Chongqing come from rural areas. In order to complete the procurement tasks in a timely manner, commercial departments at all levels, based on the characteristics of the dispersed small-scale native products in the suburbs, have added purchasing points in areas where the purchasing network is too sparse and have sent purchasing personnel to go deep into the communes and teams for mobile purchasing. In Ba County and Qijiang County, in addition to establishing dozens of fixed purchasing points for purchasing, more than 2,000 purchasers have formed many purchasing teams to purchase from communes, production teams, and canteens. This has greatly accelerated the progress of purchasing. At present, the city has purchased more than 490 dan of rosin, more than 2,200 dan of palm fiber, more than 2,690 dan of wild roasted rubber, 900 dan of tea, more than 40,000 yellow mats, and more than 620,000 straw hats.

Many small-scale native products are scattered in the homes of commune members and are very fragmented. Each district and county organized small-scale material exchange meetings for purchasing. Qijiang County is holding material exchange meetings with management areas as the focus and is carrying out the "Four Five One" activity. That is, each person finds five kinds of local products, five kinds of medicinal materials, five kinds of industrial products, and five kinds of waste products, increasing income by at least one yuan; and it promotes "adults and children not going home empty-handed after going to the market" to revitalize the rural primary market and strengthen purchasing. In early August, Qijiang and Ba counties held material exchange meetings in some management areas, purchasing more than 100 varieties of local products, with the purchase volume increasing by more than ten times compared to usual. When purchasing native products, various places have also strengthened publicity work. Commercial departments at all levels have widely publicized the importance of purchasing native products, the varieties purchased, and the prices to commune members. At the same time, various exhibitions of purchased materials are held to let commune members understand the varieties and prices that the state needs to purchase.

Commercial departments, based on the characteristics of many small-scale native products having strong seasonality, promptly helped the communes arrange labor and organized specialized teams to strengthen the picking work. Qijiang, Ba County, and the suburbs of the city organized professional teams of three to four hundred people to specialize in collecting rosin, tea, and palm fiber; scattered ones were handed over to the canteen or commune members to use their spare time to collect. More than 90,000 pine trees have now been tapped, producing more than 30 dan of rosin per day. In order to strengthen the collection of rosin, the Municipal Native Products Company has adopted the method of both tapping the potential of old areas and developing new areas. In the new area, it was found that there are more than 300,000 pine trees, which can produce more than 300,000 jin of rosin. The new area lacks technical strength, so the Municipal Native Products Company helped them train dozens of technicians. Some areas also organized cadres to help the communes collect on the mountains during their physical labor time.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 11th: The commercial departments of Fujian Province have achieved great success in purchasing agricultural, sideline, local, and special products. The total purchase value in July increased by 8.25% compared to June. Among them, the purchase volume of poultry, dried bamboo shoots, sun-cured tobacco, Litsea cubeba, etc., has increased several times; the purchase volume of rosin, handmade paper, turpentine, tung oil, persimmon oil, Litsea sebifera oil, charcoal, tea, sugar, aquatic products, egg products, etc., has also increased by 10% to 30% compared to June.

In June, the CPC Fujian Provincial Committee and party committees at all levels summarized the experience of agricultural and sideline product procurement in the first half of the year, listed this work as one of the central tasks of commercial work in the second half of the year, and strengthened specific leadership over this work. According to needs, commercial departments at all levels appropriately expanded procurement organizations, replenished procurement personnel, and improved procurement methods. Commercial departments in all special districts, cities, and counties of the province have generally added procurement management departments for agricultural products and non-staple foods; in some major local specialty product areas, procurement agencies for bamboo, firewood charcoal, aquatic products, tea, etc., have been established. According to preliminary statistics from the four special districts of Fuan, Longyan, Longxi, and Nanping, 3,795 new procurement points have been added since July, forming a procurement network for agricultural and sideline products. Procurement personnel generally adopt a combination of fixed procurement and mobile procurement to facilitate the delivery and sale of goods by the masses. In Longxi Special District, during busy procurement periods, 1,176 peddlers carry goods to the countryside and purchase agricultural and sideline products every day. Various places also hold small-scale material exchange meetings to carry out purchasing and sales activities. Many leading cadres of the special district and county commercial departments, together with their employees, carry burdens to the countryside and purchase from door to door, which has greatly encouraged commercial employees.

Commercial departments in various parts of Fujian Province have actively promoted the contract system for the procurement of agricultural and sideline products. After signing contracts with communes and production teams, they have promptly supplemented and revised the contracts according to production development and needs, thereby expanding the types and quantities of agricultural and sideline products purchased.

　　抓紧时机收购土特产品
　　重庆商业人员开动脑筋多方改进采购方法
　　福建松香桐油笋干等收购量显著增加
    本报重庆11日电　目前正是农村土特产品上市的旺季，重庆市商业部门正千方百计改进收购工作，以便利农民出售产品。
    重庆市日用工业品所需用的原料，有80％来源于农村。各级商业部门为了及时完成收购任务，他们根据市郊小宗土特产品分散的特点，在收购网过稀的地方增设了收购点，并派收购人员深入到社、队流动收购。巴县、綦江县除设立几十个固定收购点进行收购外，还由二千多收购员组成许多收购小组，到公社、生产队、食堂去收购。这样，就大大加快了收购进度。目前全市已收购了松香四百九十多担，棕片二千二百担，野生烤胶二千六百九十多担，茶叶九百担，黄席四万多张，草帽六十二万多顶。
    许多小宗土特产都分散在社员家里，又很零星。各区、县便组织了小型的物资交流会进行收购。綦江县正在以管理区为重点，召开物资交流会，并开展“四五一”活动。即每人找五种土产品、五种药材、五种工业品、五种废品，最低增加收入一元；并提倡“大人小孩赶场不打空手”以活跃农村初级市场，加强收购，8月初，綦江、巴县在部分管理区召开了物资交流会，收购了土特产品一百多个品种，收购量比平时增加十几倍。各地在收购土特产品的时候，还加强了宣传工作，各级商业部门将收购土特产品的重要意义、收购的品种、价格向社员作了广泛宣传，同时举办各种收购物资展览会，让社员明白国家需要收购的品种和价格。
    商业部门，根据许多小宗土特产品季节性强的特点，及时帮助公社安排劳动力，组织专业队加强了采摘工作。綦江、巴县及市郊各区组织了三、四百人的专业队，专门采割松脂、茶叶及棕片；零星分散的，就交给食堂或社员利用业余时间采割。现在开刀的松树已有九万余株，每天约产松脂三十多担。市土产公司，为了加强松脂的采割工作，采取既挖掘老区潜力，又发展新区的办法。在新区摸清了有松树三十多万株，可采割松脂三十多万斤。新区缺乏技术力量，市土产公司就帮助他们培训了几十名技术人员。有的地区还组织干部利用参加体力劳动时间，帮助公社上山采割。
    新华社福州11日电　福建省商业部门收购农、副、土、特产品取得很大成绩，7月份的收购总值比6月份增加8.25％。其中，家禽、笋干、晒烟、山苍子等的收购量都成倍增加；松香、土纸、松节油、桐油、柿油、蔑麻油、木炭、茶叶、食糖、水产、蛋品等的收购量也比6月份增加10％到30％不等。
    6月间，中共福建省委和各级党委总结了上半年农副产品采购工作经验，把这项工作列为下半年商业工作的中心任务之一，加强了对这项工作的具体领导。各级商业部门根据需要，适当扩大了采购组织，充实了采购人员，改进了采购方法。全省各专区、市、县的商业部门，已普遍增设了农产品、副食品的采购经理部；在一些主要土特产品产区，设立了竹子、柴炭、水产、茶叶等采购机构。据福安、龙岩、龙溪、南平四个专区的初步统计，从7月份以来已新增设采购点三千七百九十五个，形成了一个农副产品采购网。采购人员们普遍采取固定收购与流动收购相结合的方法，便利群众交售。龙溪专区各地在采购繁忙的时候，每天都有一千一百七十六担货郎担送货下乡，同时收购农副产品。各地还召开小型物资交流会，开展购销活动。许多专区、县商业部门的领导干部，同职工一起挑担下乡，登门收购，给商业职工以很大鼓舞。
    福建省各地商业部门积极推行了农副产品的采购合同制，在与公社、生产队签订合同以后，又及时根据生产发展和需要情况，补充和修订合同，因此扩大了农副产品的收购品种和数量。（附图片）
