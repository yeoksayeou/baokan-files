Pigskin "Makeover"

Speaking of pigskin, people always remember its ugly "face": hard skin surface, coarse pores, with blemishes, and water-permeable. Whether it is made into leather shoes or handbags, it is never pleasing...

However, this is already an outdated concept. Recently, the Ministry of Light Industry held an on-site conference in Shanghai on beautifying pigskin. The conference included a showroom exhibiting dozens of kinds of pigskin products. Among them were red, green, light yellow, and white; various leather jackets, leather gloves, leather shoes, handbags, and various industrial leather items. Without looking at the labels, it would be difficult to tell that they were pigskin products. Several red and light coffee-colored handbags, at first glance, looked like plastic products, called embossed color-matching leather. They are made by first embossing patterns on pigskin grain leather, and then spraying colors using the convex and concave flower patterns of the grain leather, so that the colors have different depths and a three-dimensional effect. Several pairs of black and light yellow suede slippers, with red and light blue flowers on them, are made by bleaching and dyeing suede pigskin with a bleaching agent, called carved and printed suede leather. The quality of these products is also very good. One type of waterproof suede leather can hold water for six or seven days without leaking.

In order to give pigskin a "makeover," leather research institutions and factory technicians from Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Harbin, Shenyang and other places conducted more than four months of concentrated research in Shanghai starting in February this year, and found various "beauty" tricks. For example, there is a kind of corrected grain pigskin, which is made by first grinding off a layer of the epidermis, and then applying a leather finishing agent. The "blemishes" on the skin surface immediately disappear, becoming fine, clean, smooth, and elastic.

Microscopic Balloons Invisible to the Naked Eye

Phenolic microballoons are not large balloons for children to play with, but a purplish-red powder. If you grab a small pinch and look at it under a microscope, you will see that each small particle is like a soap bubble, round, transparent and bright. Despite its small size, each bubble is filled with nitrogen. It is not afraid of heat, not afraid of water, and is lighter than both water and oil.

Sprinkling phenolic microballoons on oil reduces the contact between the oil and air, so the oil can evaporate less. Phenolic microballoons can also be used to prevent the evaporation of alcohol, gasoline, and other volatile substances. In addition, it can be combined with epoxy resin and other glues to form a lightweight insulation material.

Phenolic microballoons were successfully trial-produced by the staff of the Plastics Processing Research Office of the Shanghai Light Industry Research Institute after more than two months of research and experimentation, overcoming many difficulties. Recently, the research office sprinkled it on oil for testing and found that it can reduce oil evaporation by 45% to 47%.

Turning Waste into Treasure

The Qiqihar City No. 3 Industrial Bureau Refinery extracts petroleum and various chemical raw materials from heavy coal tar, a byproduct of the gas generator station.

They used a simple "one-tube dewatering furnace" to solve the key problem of heavy coal tar dewatering. The extracted petroleum and chemical raw materials can be made into aspirin, disinfectants, transparent plastics, rose-colored phenol, diesel and other products. Previously, this heavy coal tar was discarded as waste or mixed into coal for burning.

Now, a petroleum refining factory specializing in processing heavy coal tar has been built.

Using High-Phosphorus Native Iron to Make Brake Shoes

How to turn the harmful factors such as high phosphorus in native iron into beneficial conditions, so that native iron can play a greater role in socialist construction? This is an important research project of the Casting Research Institute of the Machinery Manufacturing and Process Science Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building. After several months of experiments, they proved that native iron with high phosphorus content can replace foreign pig iron to make brake shoes for passenger and freight cars.

Since last year, a large amount of native iron produced by small blast furnaces contains high phosphorus. This type of native iron is brittle, but hard, wear-resistant, and astringent, making it suitable for the needs of locomotive and vehicle factories to produce brake shoes for passenger and freight cars. In the past, because this type of native iron was not available, phosphorus elements had to be added when manufacturing with foreign pig iron. Now, with the cooperation of relevant departments, the research institute has made a batch of passenger car brake shoes using native iron with high phosphorus content. They installed this type of brake shoe and brake shoes made of foreign pig iron on eight passenger cars respectively, with one of each type installed on each wheel for testing. The train traveled back and forth on the Shenyang-Changchun railway fourteen times, for a total of several thousand kilometers. Fourteen verifications proved that the lifespan of brake shoes made of high-phosphorus native iron is generally three to five times longer than that of brake shoes made of foreign pig iron.

This research achievement has been applied in the Shenyang Railway Bureau.

"Tire Pressure Indicator Light"

A car is speeding on the highway, when suddenly the light on the dashboard in the cab flashes, and the driver promptly stops the car and tells the passengers: the tire is low on air.

It turns out that this car is equipped with a "tire pressure indicator light." It is made by using the waste exhaust valve as a pressure-sensing rod, and using the spring and iron pipe of the waste exhaust valve installed on the tire rim. When the tire pressure is 30 to 40 pounds low, the indicator light will illuminate, promptly reporting the low pressure to the driver, which can avoid damaging the tire due to low pressure, extend tire life, and improve transportation efficiency.

The creator of this "tire pressure indicator light" is Liu Huanting, a young driver from the Qinggang County Transportation Bureau in Heilongjiang Province. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    科学技术集锦
    为猪皮“整容”
    提起猪皮，人们总忘不了它那付丑陋的“面容”：皮面硬，毛孔粗，有麻点，还要透水。无论是做成皮鞋、皮包，总不讨人喜欢……
    然而，这已经是过时的概念了。最近，轻工业部在上海召开美化猪皮的现场会议，会议附设了一个陈列室，展出好几十种猪皮制的产品。其中有红色的、绿色的、淡黄色的、白色的，有各种皮夹克、皮手套、皮鞋、皮包和多种工业用的皮件。如果不看标签，很难分辨出它们是猪皮制品。有几只红色和淡咖啡色的皮包，粗看起来很像塑料制品，名叫压花套色革，是用猪皮面革先压制花纹，然后利用面革凹凸花型喷涂颜色，使颜色深浅不一，有立体感。有几双黑色和淡黄色的绒面皮拖鞋，上面有红色、淡蓝色的花，是将绒面猪皮用退色剂雕白染色而成，称雕白印花绒面革。这些产品的质量也很好。有一种防水绒面革，人们用它盛水，六、七天都不渗透。
    为了给猪皮“整容”，上海市和北京、天津、重庆、广州、哈尔滨、沈阳等地的皮革研究机构和工厂技术人员，今年2月起在上海先后进行了四个多月的集中研究，找出了各种“美容”妙术。例如有一种猪皮修正面革，是先把表皮磨掉一层，然后涂上皮革涂饰剂，皮面的“麻点”立即消失，变得细洁滑腻，又富有弹性。
    肉眼看不见的气球
    酚醛微微气球可不是孩子们玩的大气球，而是一种紫红色的粉末。把它抓一小撮放到显微镜下看，你会看见它每一个小颗粒都象肥皂泡一样，圆圆的，通明透亮。别看它小，每个泡里都装满了氮气。它不怕热，不怕水，比水和油都轻。
    把酚醛微微气球撒在石油上面，这些小小的气泡就会使石油和空气减少接触，石油就可以少挥发掉一些。酚醛微微气球还可以用来防止酒精、汽油等其他挥发性物质的挥发。此外，它又可以和环氧树脂等胶合成一种轻便的隔热材料。
    酚醛微微气球是上海市轻工业研究所塑料加工研究室的人员，经过两个多月的研究试验，克服了不少困难，在不久前试制成功的，最近研究室把它撒在石油上试验，发现可以使石油少挥发掉45％到47％。
    废品变宝
    齐齐哈尔市第三工业局炼油厂从煤气发生站的副产品重质煤焦油中，提炼出石油和各种化学原料。
    他们是用“一管式脱水炉”土办法，解决了重质煤焦油脱水的关键。提炼出来的石油和化学原料，可以制成阿斯匹灵，消毒剂、透明的塑料、玫瑰色的酚、柴油等产品。在以前，这种重质煤焦油是被当作废品倒掉或掺到煤里烧掉的。
    现在，一座专门处理重质煤焦油的石油炼制工厂已经建成了。
    高磷土铁做闸瓦
    如何变土铁的高磷等有害因素为有利条件，让土铁在社会主义建设中发挥更大的作用？这是第一机械工业部机械制造与工艺科学研究院铸造研究所进行的一项重要研究项目。他们经过几个月的试验，证明用含磷高的土铁可以代替洋生铁做客（货）车的闸瓦。
    去年以来，大量小高炉生产的土铁中，有一种含磷高的土铁，质地脆，但是坚硬耐磨，而且发涩，适合于机车车辆工厂生产客（货）车闸瓦需要。过去因为没有这种土铁，用洋生铁制造时不得不外加磷的原素。现在，这个研究所在有关部门协作下，用含磷高的土铁做好了一批客车闸瓦。他们用这种闸瓦和用洋生铁做的闸瓦，分别安装在八节客车上，每个车轮上安装这两种闸瓦各一块，进行试验。在沈阳到长春的铁路上往返十四次，共行驶了几千公里。十四次检验证明，用高磷土铁做的闸瓦，它的寿命一般要比用洋生铁做的闸瓦长三倍到五倍。
    这一研究成果，已经在沈阳铁路局应用。
   “轮胎缺气指示灯”
    一辆汽车迅速行驶在公路上，忽然驾驶室仪表板上的灯一闪一闪地发出亮光，司机及时地把汽车停下来，告诉乘客：轮胎缺气了。
    原来这辆车上装置了“轮胎缺气指示灯”。它是利用汽车废气门做感压杆，用废气门的弹簧、铁管等旧材料安装在轮胎钢圈上做成的。当轮胎缺气三十到四十磅时，指示灯便发出亮光，及时把缺气的消息报告给司机，这就可以避免因缺气而压坏外胎，使轮胎寿命延长和提高运输效率。
    这种“轮胎缺气指示灯”的创造者，是黑龙江省青冈县交通运输局青年司机刘焕廷。（据新华社）
