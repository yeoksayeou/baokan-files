　　Snapshots of Student Life During Summer Vacation
　　"Friendship Choir" Rehearsing
    A group of enthusiastic little listeners surrounded the door and windows of the Beijing Children's Palace choir room. The young members of the "Friendship Choir" were inside singing their familiar "Young Pioneers Song": "Our flag is as red as fire, stars and torches point the way...". The young members were arranged in a choir formation, intently watching the conductor and conscientiously executing the conductor's requests.
    This choir, composed of more than one hundred and twenty junior and primary school students, was established in 1955 with the proposal and specific assistance of Soviet choir conducting expert Domashev. Domashev often personally guided the choir's rehearsals and wrote the choral piece "Friendship Song" for them. After returning to his country, he frequently wrote letters and sent sheet music to the choir. Chinese musicians Ma Sicong, Qu Xixian, Liu Chi, and others also often assisted them in their activities, writing songs for them, listening to them sing, and offering guidance. The song "Lovely School," which the choir was recently preparing to rehearse, was specially written for them by Qu Xixian. Over the years, this choir composed of children has participated in the singing for films such as "Spring Festival Gala" and "Little Pioneers Greening the Yangtze River" and frequently made recordings for the radio. Now, joining this choir has become the wish of young music enthusiasts in Beijing. Shortly before the summer vacation, more than twenty children joined the choir. Some were active participants in school entertainment activities and were recommended by their schools; others were transferred from the Children's Palace's "Primary School Choir."
    This summer vacation, they will learn seven or eight songs such as "Young Pioneers Chorus" and "Communist Children's League Song," preparing to perform in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Young Pioneers.
    August 2nd was Sunday, and in the afternoon, the children arrived on time. Under the guidance of their counselors, they rehearsed two songs. After singing, the children left the Children's Palace, singing and laughing all the way. Li Fangrong, a student at Girls' No. 1 Middle School, was eager to go home because there might be another small "choir" waiting for her at home. The members of that small "choir" were her seven siblings, most of whom she taught to sing.
　　Singing and Dancing by Nanhu Lake
    On August 2nd, twenty students from the Geography Department of Jilin Normal University, who were staying at school for the summer vacation, visited outstanding teachers at the Teachers' College Affiliated High School and listened to a talk about the glorious significance of being a teacher. Afterward, they went to the beautiful Nanhu Park. In this refreshing place, they played beautiful dance music with instruments such as accordions, violins, erhus, flutes, and pipas. Young men and women danced gracefully, and tourists in the distance were attracted by their joy and dancing.
    At this moment, the singing and dancing paused, and Chen Lizhu, the most active girl in the class, came out to recite a lyrical poem. The content of the poem and her soft and pleasant voice brought everyone to the future twenty years later: everyone saw the great significance of their profession, and saw thousands of students growing up under their hard work and becoming doctors, engineers, agronomists, and teachers. Wherever they went, there were their students; it was truly a garden full of spring flowers and peach and apricot trees.
    Then, in groups of three or five, they and the students of the Teachers' College Affiliated High School sat around on the lawn or strolled along the tree-lined paths. Like brothers and sisters, they held hands and talked about their personal interests and the bright and glorious future of the motherland. Some took a small boat and swayed in the heart of the lake, others recited famous poems by the lake, or sang to their heart's content. Some also took their guitars and went to quiet places to sing folk songs from their hometowns.
    On the green lawn, the girls' singing rang out again with the accordion, the song like the ripples of Nanhu Lake, leisurely heading into the distance.
　　Welcoming the Sunrise at Sea
    During the hot summer, five middle schools in Shanghai's Huangpu District, including Gezhi, Jinling, and Puguang, formed a summer camp, living a rich and colorful and pleasant life for a week.
    At three o'clock in the morning, a slight sound suddenly came from a company's barracks. The students woke up from their sleep and rushed to the open space outside the barracks to assemble in a very short time. No lights were turned on, and no one spoke. Everyone quietly waited for the assignment of new tasks. This was the first "emergency assembly" since the students entered the camp, more than an hour earlier than the scheduled wake-up time, but no one felt tired.
    Within seconds of receiving the order, the students set off in formation. At this time, the stars filled the sky, and the waning moon hung high in the air. The fields exuded a burst of fragrance. This team seemed to have wings on its feet, crossing jungles and hills, and walking swiftly in the dark. Hundreds of feet stepped on the road, making a "rustling" sound, neat and rhythmic. The summer insects in the grass sang as accompanists for the marching song.
    Along the way, they practiced "marching" movements, and then saw the sea dyke standing in front of them like a city wall. Climbing up, they saw the vast sea and heard the sound of the waves lapping against the shore. The destination had been reached within the prescribed time. They were here to watch the sun rise from the east. The students greeted the spectacular sight of the sunrise at sea with laughter and applause. (Attached pictures)

　　暑假学生生活小景
　　“友谊合唱团”在练唱
    一群热心的小听众围在北京市少年宫合唱室的门口和窗口，“友谊合唱团”的小团员们正在里面唱他们熟悉的“红领巾之歌”：“我们的旗帜火一样红，星星和火把指明路程……”。小团员们排成了合唱的队形，凝神地望着指挥，认真地执行指挥的要求。
    这个由一百二十多个初中和小学学生组成的合唱团，是1955年在苏联合唱指挥专家杜马舍夫倡议和具体帮助下成立的，杜马舍夫经常亲自指导合唱团练唱，并为它写过“友谊之歌”合唱曲，他回国以后，还经常给合唱团写信，寄歌片。我国音乐家马思聪、瞿希贤、刘炽等，也经常协助他们开展活动，为他们写作歌曲，听他们歌唱，提出指导意见。这个合唱团最近要练习的歌曲“可爱的学校”，就是瞿希贤特为他们写的。几年来，这个由少年儿童组成的合唱团，曾参加过“春节大联欢”、“绿化长江的小尖兵”等影片的演唱，还经常到电台录音。现在，参加这个合唱团成了北京市小音乐爱好者的心愿。在暑假前不久，又有二十多个孩子参加到合唱团来了，他们有的是学校文娱活动积极分子，经过学校介绍考进来的；有的是由少年宫的“小学生合唱团”转来的。
    今年暑假里，他们要学“少先队大合唱”“共产主义儿童团歌”等七、八首歌曲，准备在庆祝少先队建队十周年时演出。
    8月2日是星期日，下午孩子们准时地来了，他们在辅导员的指导下练唱了两首歌子。唱完了歌，孩子们一路又唱又笑地离开了少年宫。女一中的学生李方荣急着回家去，因为家里可能另有个小“合唱队”在等她哩，那个小“合唱队”的成员，就是她们姐弟七个，弟妹们在家唱歌，多是她教的。
　　歌舞在南湖边
    8月2日这天，吉林师范大学地理系三年级二十名暑假留校的学生在访问了师大附中优秀教师，听了有关当教师的光荣意义的谈话以后，就到秀丽的南湖公园。在这风清气爽的地方，用手风琴、小提琴、二胡、笛子、琵琶等乐器奏起优美的舞曲。小伙子们和姑娘们翩翩起舞，远处的游人也被他们的欢乐和舞蹈吸引来了。
    这时，歌舞暂停，全班最活跃的女生陈丽珠出来给大家朗诵了一首畅想抒情诗。诗的内容和她那柔美动听的声调把大家带到二十年后的未来：大家看到了自己职业的伟大意义，看到了将来成千上万个学生在他们的辛勤培育下成长起来，成了医生、工程师、农艺师和人民教师。走到那里，都有他们的学生，真是春花朵朵、桃杏满园。
    接着他们三五成群地和师大附中学生围坐在草坪上，或漫步在林荫小径上。他们像兄弟姐妹一样，手拉手谈叙着个人的爱好和祖国光辉灿烂的未来。有的乘上一叶扁舟，在湖心荡漾，有的在湖边诵读名诗，或尽情歌唱。也有的拿着吉它，走到幽静的地方唱起家乡的民歌。
    在绿色的草坪上，姑娘们的歌声随着手风琴再次响起，歌声像南湖的微波，悠悠地奔向远方。
　　迎接海上日出
    夏日炎炎，上海市黄浦区格致、金陵、浦光等五个中学组成了一个夏令营，在一周中，过着丰富多采的愉快的生活。
    清晨三点钟，一个连队的营房里，突然发出轻微的声音。同学们都从睡梦中苏醒，在极短促的时间里，奔向营房外的空地上集合。没有点灯，也没有讲话的声音，大家静静地等候分配新的任务。这是同学们入营以来第一次“紧急集合”，比规定的起床时间要早一个多小时，但谁都不觉得疲倦。
    在接受命令的几秒钟内，同学们就列队出发了。这时繁星满天，下弦月高悬空中。田野里散发出阵阵清香。这一支队伍，好像脚上添了翅膀，穿过丛林、越过小山，在黑夜里疾走。几百只脚踏在公路上，发出“沙沙”声，整齐而有节奏。草丛中的夏虫低吟作了行军曲的伴奏者。
    沿途演习了“行军”动作，然后望见了海堤像一座城墙矗立在眼前，攀上去，就看到茫茫大海，听到浪涛的拍岸声，目的地已经在规定的时间到达了。他们就在这里看太阳从东方升起，同学们用欢笑和掌声迎接海上的日出奇景。（附图片）
