	Japan Suffers Severe Typhoon Damage
	Tokyo News - Half of Japan was hit by a typhoon on the 14th and 15th, causing severe flooding.
	Reports say this flood is the worst since 1907. According to Japanese official announcements at 10:00 AM on the 15th, floods have inundated more than 51,670 hectares of farmland, and washed away or submerged more than 200,000 houses, leaving large numbers of residents homeless.
	U.S. Missile Test Another Debacle
	Cape Canaveral News - The United States' "Titan" missile test on the 14th was another debacle. The missile fell and burned just a few feet from the launch pad. The United States has boasted that the "Titan" missile is an intercontinental missile with a range of so-called more than 6,000 miles. But so far, it has not undergone a full-range test.

    美国试验导弹又出丑
    卡纳维拉尔角消息　美国14日试验“泰坦”导弹又出了丑。导弹离开发射台只有几英尺就掉下烧毁。美国曾吹嘘说“泰坦”式导弹是射程达所谓六千多英里的洲际导弹。但到现在，它还没有经过全射程试验。
