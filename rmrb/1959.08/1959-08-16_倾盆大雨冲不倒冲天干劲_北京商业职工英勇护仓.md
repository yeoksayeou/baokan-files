Torrential Rain Cannot Wash Away Soaring Enthusiasm
Beijing Commercial Workers Heroically Protect Warehouses
Effective Routine Measures Include Three Checks During the Rainy Season: Check Rain Protection Preparations Before the Rain, Check Goods Covering and Drainage Ditches During the Rain, and Check for Leaks After the Rain

(Reported by our newspaper) During the recent heavy rains, warehouse workers in the Beijing commercial system used their heroic and tenacious fighting spirit to repel the rain's attacks and ensure the safety of stored grain and various commodities.

The warehouses affiliated with the Beijing Storage and Transportation Company store more than 42,000 kinds of goods. The rainfall this summer has been exceptionally heavy, creating many difficulties for commodity storage. To ensure that commodities safely survive the rainy season, the warehouse workers established a summer defense headquarters, formulated various specific measures for safe summering, inspected all power sources, dredged 27,000 meters of waterways, and moved all 9,200 tons of commodities unsuitable for placement in the freight yard into warehouses. Grain warehouses also strengthened the "three checks" during the rainy season – checking rain protection preparations before the rain, checking the covering of goods and drainage ditches during the rain, and checking for leaks after the rain. They comprehensively checked and ranked the stored goods, strengthened the maintenance of goods with safety problems in a planned manner, and handled them in conjunction with shipments.

To protect the safety of commodities, the warehouse workers guarded the warehouses day and night, waging a tenacious struggle against the rain. On the evening of July 31, a sudden wind and rainstorm struck. Leading cadres of the Malian Road Warehouse, who were in a meeting, immediately led the workers to the warehouses and freight yards for rescue. At this time, the Lianhua River near the warehouse was overflowing due to poor water discharge, and many areas were waist-deep in water. They immediately formed a rescue team to block the drainage holes leading to the warehouse and prevent floodwater from entering. On August 6, the rainstorm was particularly heavy, and the Santaishan Warehouse was surrounded by floodwater, with the water level only four or five inches away from the warehouse doors. The workers of this warehouse braved the storm, some standing in waist-deep ditches to dredge waterways and drain accumulated water; some rushing to build earth embankments to block the floodwater; and some rescuing materials. The joint venture warehouse and the Guangqu East Road Warehouse had poor construction conditions, and many warehouses leaked. The workers were on duty in the warehouses, and wherever there was a leak, they would go to rescue it, day or night. Zhang Fu, a worker at the Guangqu East Road Warehouse, heard the sound of rain at night and rushed to cover the goods. However, the wind was too strong, and the rope could not hold the tarp in place, so he used all his strength to pull the tarp, persevering for half an hour in the wind and rain. On August 1, the Yongdingmen Grain Warehouse was temporarily assigned the task of transferring grain externally. Before they could finish covering the opened stacks, the storm arrived. At this time, all the warehouse workers braved the wind and rain, rushing to the scene to cover the grain. Li Yuzhong, the secretary of the general party branch, led the custodians and workers to inspect the site and found that the drainage ditch on the east side, near the power grid outlet, had been damaged by the rain, preventing water from draining. Seven or eight grain stacks were about to be soaked in the accumulated water. At this critical moment, Wu Chaochen, a custodian, jumped into the three-foot-deep drainage ditch, removed the blocking bricks and stones, and the accumulated water in the yard was quickly drained.

Now that the rainy season in Beijing has not yet passed, the warehouse workers are doubling their efforts to strengthen protection work and resolutely ensure that stored grain and commodities safely survive the rainy season.

    倾盆大雨冲不倒冲天干劲
    北京商业职工英勇护仓
    行之有效的经常措施是雨季三查：雨前查防雨准备，雨中查货位遮盖和排水沟，雨后查有无漏湿现象
    本报讯　在最近的大雨期间，北京市商业系统的仓库职工，用英勇顽强的战斗精神，击退雨水袭击，保证了储存粮食和各种商品的安全。
    北京市储运公司所属仓库储存着四万二千多种商品。今年夏季降雨量特大，给商品保管带来了许多困难。仓库职工为了保证商品安全度过雨季，成立了夏防指挥部，先后制定了安全度夏的各种具体措施，检查了全部电源，疏通了两万七千多米的水道，把不适宜放在货场的九千二百多吨商品全部移进库房。各粮食仓库还加强了雨季三查——雨前查防雨准备，雨中查货位遮盖和排水沟，雨后查有无漏湿现象，对库存货物普查排队，对安全有问题的货物，有计划地加强维护，并结合出库进行处理。
    各仓库职工为了保护商品安全，白天黑夜坚守库房，向雨水作顽强斗争。7月31日晚，狂风暴雨骤起，正在开会的马连道仓库领导干部立即带领职工到库房、货场抢救。这时，仓库附近的莲花河因水泄不畅正在外溢，许多地区已水深及腰，他们马上组成了抢险大队，堵住通往库内的沟眼，防止洪水进入仓库。8月6日暴雨特大，三台山仓库被洪水包围，水位离库房门只有四、五寸左右。这个仓库的职工冒着暴雨，有的站在齐腰深的水沟里疏通水道，排除积水；有的抢筑土埝挡住洪水，有的抢救物资。合营仓库和广渠东路仓库的建筑条件不好，很多库房漏雨，职工们就在库房值班，不论白天黑夜，那里漏雨，他们就到那里去抢救。广渠东路仓库工人张富，在夜里听到雨声，便连忙去抢苫，可是风太大，绳子拴不住扣，他就用力拉住苫布，在狂风暴雨中坚持了半个小时，8月1日，永定门粮食仓库临时增加了外调粮食的任务，还没有来得及等他们把打开的囤垛抢苫完，暴风雨就来了。这时，全库职工冒着风雨，奋不顾身地赶到现场抢苫粮食。党总支书记李玉仲率领保管员和工人到场内检查，发现东边靠电网出口处的排水沟被雨水冲坏，水泄不出去，眼看有七、八个粮囤就要被积水泡湿。在这紧要关头，保管员吴朝臣跳到深达三尺的排水沟口，搬开堵塞的砖头石块，场内积水就很快排泄出去了。
    现在，北京的雨季还没有过去，各仓库职工正在百倍努力加强防护工作，坚决保证储存粮食和商品安全度过雨季。
