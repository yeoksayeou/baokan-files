Key Projects Advance at Full Speed
Wuhan Iron and Steel Company Rushes to Complete Unfinished Iron Smelting System Projects
Sanmenxia Project Enters New Phase Centered on Installation
Luoyang Bearing Factory and Other Construction Departments Increase Labor Efficiency

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 9th - After criticizing the slack mood and fear of difficulties among some cadres, the workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company are now greatly boosting their revolutionary zeal. They are determined to complete the unfinished projects of the first-phase iron smelting system in the shortest possible time—the sintering plant, the concentrator, and other auxiliary facilities—to ensure high-quality and high-yield from the two blast furnaces, and to greet the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

Now, the concentrator, located at the foot of the Daye Iron Mountain, has been built with tall, silver-gray factory buildings; the first and second series of flotation machine systems have completed 90% of the work; major equipment such as ball mills, flotation machines, and magnetic separators have been installed. The sintering main plant, over 40 meters high, stands majestically in the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company factory area; the several-mile-long belt corridors and transfer stations surrounding the factory building have been basically completed. The sintering plant and projects for material supply, batching, mixing, and power have been mostly completed, and the main equipment has been installed. Starting from August, both plants have entered the single-unit test run stage. The builders are determined to overcome the heat, ensure "hard work for half a month, joint test runs, and strive to put the sintering plant into production in August"; "ensure that the first and second series of flotation machines at the concentrator are completed in August and put into production in September."

Of the 125 engineering projects in the first phase of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's iron smelting system, 120 projects were basically completed by the time the No. 2 blast furnace was put into production on July 2nd, leaving only the concentrator and the sintering plant unfinished. At this time, some cadres did not sufficiently recognize the importance of completing the unfinished projects of the iron smelting system and mistakenly believed that the "pig iron hurdle" had been overcome, resulting in complacency and slackness; others emphasized difficulties and lacked enthusiasm. Since July, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee has held various meetings to clarify the situation, criticize the newly emerging slack mood and fear of difficulties among some cadres, and point out that rapidly building the concentrator and sintering plant is key to Wuhan Iron and Steel Company further increasing pig iron production and completing this year's pig iron production plan. It demanded that workers on the construction front boost their energy, race against time, and first rapidly build these two plants and put them into production. The Iron Smelting Headquarters and the Party organizations of various construction units also successively held meetings to gather ideas and held mass mobilization rallies, calling on all workers to fight hard in August and September, quickly build the concentrator and sintering plant, and strive to ensure the completion of this year's pig iron production tasks.

Now, a new construction upsurge has been set off at the concentration and sintering sites. Machine installation workers strive to complete their tasks on the same day to ensure the realization of the test run plan. Electrical installation workers rush to install cables and motors overnight to ensure timely supply of power for test runs. Many leading cadres hold on-site coordination meetings every day to check the construction progress and project quality.

In order to overcome the hot summer and ensure the health of the workers, all construction units have strengthened measures to prevent heatstroke and cool down, increased cold drinks, built more shelters, and adjusted working hours. The workers are now full of energy, fighting harder and harder, and determined to quickly and efficiently build the concentrator and sintering plant.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th - The Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub Project has entered a new construction phase centered on installation work. Two large-scale installation projects—the 7.5-meter-diameter penstock inside the powerhouse dam and the trestle bridge adapted for future high-altitude concrete pouring—officially started on August 1st; a large refrigeration plant supplying cooling water to the dam also started trial operation on the same day.

After completing the work of raising and reinforcing the cofferdam protecting the dam construction and pouring the dam to an elevation that can partially provide flood control, the builders of Sanmenxia immediately threw themselves into new battles. They decided to pour more than 500,000 cubic meters of concrete in the remaining five months of this year and complete the installation of about 8,000 tons of metal structures and large construction machinery within the year to meet the needs of raising the dam.

In order to ensure the smooth completion of these technically complex installation projects with high-quality requirements, the Engineering Bureau began training technicians and manufacturing equipment as early as the beginning of this year. After entering the third quarter, it took measures to accelerate the progress of the project. In the process of equipment manufacturing and installation, they also received support from various places. Factories in Xi'an, Luoyang, Shanghai, and other places have undertaken some of the processing and manufacturing tasks for trestle bridge steel beams, penstocks, and welding rods.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th - Various national key construction projects in Luoyang City are accelerating.

The expansion project of Luoyang Bearing Factory, which started construction in the second half of last year, has basically completed the factory buildings for the wire drawing and forging workshops, and the factory buildings for auxiliary workshops have also completed about 80%. The factory area's sewers, canteens, etc., are under intense construction. The finishing part of the first-phase project of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant and the second-phase project have exceeded the construction plan every month for the past seven months. Currently, they have completed more than 90% of this year's construction plan. The installation of large high-temperature and high-pressure boilers and turbo generators in the second-phase project of the Luoyang Thermal Power Plant, as well as the corresponding factory building expansion project, are progressing simultaneously. The advanced refractory material factory with a design capacity of 256,000 tons per year was originally planned to be completed in three years. After the recent year of construction, more than 70% of the total workload has now been completed. The construction unit is advancing victoriously, striving to achieve greater results in the third quarter. Luoyang Glass Factory, which has modern technical standards, has also accelerated the progress of the construction project, preparing to put half of the equipment in the glass fiber workshop into production this year and manufacture 200 tons of glass fiber to meet the needs of industrial construction.

The Luoyang Municipal Party Committee recently strengthened its leadership over key basic construction projects. Construction and construction units strengthened mutual cooperation and coordination, and concentrated the use of manpower and material resources, thus ensuring the smooth progress of the project. In the hoisting project of prefabricated components for the bearing factory's factory building, the factory, the engineering office, and the Henan Mechanized Construction Station jointly formed a construction site headquarters. The factory provided welding machines and welders, the engineering office was responsible for the supply of components and the transportation of small components, and the mechanized construction station was responsible for hoisting. This enabled the project, which was originally planned to require 60 shifts to complete hoisting, to be completed in only 30 shifts.

The workers building various key projects also tried their best to overcome difficulties and create conditions for accelerating the progress of the project. The workers of the First Engineering Office of the Henan Thermal Power Installation Company, who undertook the machine installation project of the thermal power plant, manufactured dozens of machines and tools such as electric welders and winches themselves, which greatly improved labor efficiency. The workers of the 302 Engineering Office of the Third Construction Engineering Company of Henan Province, in the construction of non-ferrous repair casting, cast steel, and other workshops of the tractor factory, launched a technical innovation campaign, promoted 11 kinds of 115 advanced tools, realized vertical transportation mechanization, and semi-mechanization of earthwork projects, increasing work efficiency by one to more than twenty times.

　　抓进度抓质量抓节约抓安全
　　重点工程兼程跃进
　　武汉钢铁公司突击炼铁系统未完工程
　　三门峡工程进入安装为中心的新阶段
　　洛阳轴承厂等施工部门提高劳动效率
    新华社武汉9日电　武汉钢铁公司最近批判了部分干部的松劲情绪和畏难情绪以后，职工们大鼓革命干劲，坚决在最短期内，突击建成第一期炼铁体系的未完工程——烧结厂、选矿厂和其他辅助设施，确保两座高炉优质高产，迎接国庆十周年。
    现在，座落在大冶铁山脚下的选矿厂，已盖起了高大的银灰色的厂房；一、二列浮选机系统工程，已完成90％的工作量；球磨机、浮选机、磁选机等主要设备都已安装完毕。四十多米高的烧结主厂房已巍然屹立在武钢厂区；围绕着厂房四周的数里长的皮带通廊、转运站，都已经基本建成了。烧结厂和供料、配料、混合料、动力等工程，已经大部分完工，主要设备都安装好了。从8月份起，这两个厂都开始进入单体试车阶段。建设者们决心战胜炎暑，保证“苦干半月，联合试车，争取烧结厂8月份投入生产”；“确保选矿厂的一、二列浮选机8月建成，9月投入生产。”
    武钢第一期炼铁体系的一百二十五个工程项目，到今年7月二号高炉投入生产时，共有一百二十个项目基本建成，只剩下选矿厂和烧结厂尚未完工。这时有部分干部对完成炼铁体系未完工程的重要性认识不足，误认为“生铁关”已经过去了，产生了自满松劲情绪；有的人则强调困难，干劲不足。7月份以来，武钢党委召开了各种会议，阐明形势，批判了部分干部中新近抬头的松劲情绪和畏难情绪，指出迅速建成选矿厂和烧结厂，是武钢进一步提高生铁产量，完成今年生铁生产计划的关键。要求施工战线的职工鼓足干劲，分秒必争，首先迅速将这两个厂建成投入生产。炼铁指挥部和各施工单位党组织也相继召开会议务虚，并召开了群众誓师动员大会，号召全体职工奋战8、9月，迅速建成选矿厂和烧结厂，为确保完成今年的生铁生产任务而奋斗。
    现在，选矿、烧结工地已经掀起新的施工热潮。机器安装工人努力做到当天任务当天完，保证试车计划实现。电气安装工人连夜突击安装电缆线和马达，保证及时供应试车用的电源。许多领导干部天天在现场开碰头会议，检查施工进度和工程质量。
    为了战胜炎热盛暑，保证工人身体健康，各施工单位都加强了防暑降温措施，增加清凉饮料，增盖了凉棚，调整了作业时间。工人们现在劲头十足，越战越勇，决心快速优质建成选矿厂和烧结厂。
    新华社郑州9日电　三门峡水利枢纽工程进入以安装工程为中心的施工新阶段。电站坝体内直径七点五米的水压钢管和适应今后高空混凝土浇筑的栈桥两项大型安装工程，已在8月1日正式开工；供应大坝冷却用水的一座大型冷冻厂也在同天试运转。
    三门峡的建设者，在完成掩护大坝施工的围堰加高加固工程，并将大坝浇筑到能起部分拦洪作用的高程以后，立即投入了新的战斗。他们决定在今年后五个月再浇筑五十多万立方米的混凝土，在年内完成八千吨左右金属结构和大型施工机械的安装任务，以适应大坝升高的需要。
    为了保证这些技术复杂、质量要求又高的安装工程顺利完成，工程局早在今年年初就开始培养技工和制造设备等，进入第三季度以后，又采取措施加快工程进度。在设备制造和安装过程中，他们还得到了各地的支援。西安、洛阳、上海等地工厂都担负了一部分栈桥钢梁、水压钢管、电焊条的加工和制造任务。
    新华社郑州9日电　洛阳市各项国家重点建设工程正在加速进行。
    去年下半年开始施工的洛阳轴承厂扩建工程，拔丝、锻工两个车间的厂房已经基本完成，辅助车间的厂房也完成了80％左右，厂区下水道、食堂等都在紧张施工。第一拖拉机制造厂一期工程中的收尾部分和二期工程，七个月来每月都超额完成施工计划，目前已经完成今年施工计划的90％以上，洛阳热电厂二期工程中的大型高温高压锅炉、汽轮发电机的安装，以及相应的厂房扩建工程，正在齐头并进。设计能力为年产二十五万六千吨的高级耐火材料厂，原计划三年建成，经过最近一年的施工，现在已经完成全部工作量的70％以上。施工单位正乘胜前进，力争三季度取得更大的成绩。具有现代技术水平的洛阳玻璃厂，也加快了建筑工程的进度，准备今年将玻璃纤维车间的半数设备投入生产，并且制造出二百吨玻璃纤维，满足工业建设需要。
    中共洛阳市委最近加强了对重点基本建设工程的领导，建设、施工等单位加强了相互之间的配合协作，集中使用人力物力，因而保证了工程顺利进展。轴承厂在厂房预制构件吊装工程中，由于工厂、工程处和河南省机械化施工站联合组成了施工现场指挥部，由工厂出电焊机和电焊工人，工程处负责构件的供应和小型构件的运输，机械化施工站负责吊装，从而使原计划需要六十个台班才能吊装完毕的工程，仅用三十个台班就完成了任务。
    建设各个重点工程的职工也千方百计克服困难，为加快工程进度创造条件。承担热电厂机器安装工程的河南省火电安装公司第一工程处的职工，自己制造了电焊机、卷扬机等几十种机械和工具，大大提高了劳动效率。河南省第三建筑工程公司三○二工程处的职工，在拖拉机厂有色修铸、铸钢等车间施工中，开展了技术革新运动，推广了十一种一百一十五件先进工具，实现了垂直运输卷扬化，土方工程半机械化，提高工效一倍到二十多倍。（附图片）
