Xinhua News Agency, August 11th dispatch from Moscow via TASS: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, pointed out in a reply letter on the 5th to the delegation from the World Federation of Scientific Workers, that the Soviet Union is willing to immediately sign an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapon tests.

Khrushchev received the delegation from the World Federation of Scientific Workers in May and held discussions with the delegation on the issue of stopping nuclear weapon tests. Later, Khrushchev received a letter signed by eighteen world-renowned scientists. These scientists included Powell and Bernal (Great Britain), Pierre (France), Topchiev (Soviet Union), Mahalanobis (India), Zhou Peiyuan (China), Ogawa (Japan), and Danesh (Poland), among others. In their letter, they expressed concern over the grave dangers arising from the arms race and the continued testing of nuclear weapons. They called for the immediate conclusion of an international agreement to stop testing nuclear weapons.

In his reply to the scientists, published in Moscow on the 11th, Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet government considers the conclusion of an agreement to stop nuclear tests to be of great significance and views such an agreement as the most important step towards taking further and broader measures in disarmament and the normalization of the international situation.

The head of the Soviet government pointed out that the Soviet Union had made great efforts to reach an agreement during the Soviet, American, and British talks in Geneva on the cessation of nuclear weapon tests. Thanks to the initiative of the Soviet side, some progress has been made, but the main difficulties have not yet been overcome.

Khrushchev pointed out in his reply that in order for the conference to be completely successful, the representatives of the United States and Great Britain must also have the sincerity of cooperation and the desire to achieve the purpose of the conference.

Xinhua News Agency, August 12th dispatch from Geneva via TASS: TASS correspondent Novikov reports: The news of the upcoming mutual visits between Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev and U.S. President Eisenhower has been met with great satisfaction around the world. People of all countries associate this historic event with the hope of easing international tensions, ending the arms race, and ushering in an era of peaceful development. It is no accident that countries are again calling for a halt to nuclear weapon testing at this time.

However, Western newspapers recently reported that certain individuals in the United States holding very important positions are advocating the resumption of nuclear weapon tests, even though negotiations are continuing in Geneva to reach an agreement on a universal cessation of nuclear weapon tests.

For example, Senator Anderson, chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy of both houses of the U.S. Congress, said on August 5th that the United States might resume nuclear testing after October 31st. Prior to this, McCone, chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, had also loudly proclaimed this. Later, U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy confirmed the above remarks in a statement on August 6th. According to the "New York Times," McElroy specifically stated: "If an agreement on nuclear weapon testing with the Soviet Union has not been reached by the time the one-year moratorium expires in October, then there is hope for resuming nuclear testing."

Such clamoring can naturally cause reasonable unease, especially when it comes from influential officials such as McElroy, Anderson, and McCone.

Journalists at the Palais des Nations in Geneva said that the U.S. representative attending the meeting on the non-continuation of nuclear weapon tests had suggested discussing this statement, which is inconsistent with the genuine U.S. policy on the cessation of nuclear tests. If this is the case, it is gratifying.

However, a report in the U.S. "New York Times" on July 21st proves that a nuclear weapon test site is being built on Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshall Islands, and $9 million has been allocated for the project, while in Nevada, tunnels are being dug for underground nuclear explosions.

On the other hand, the long-standing refusal of the U.S. delegation at the conference to respond to the Soviet proposal on the prior agreement of the number of inspection agencies is the main reason why the conference cannot make progress. These facts cannot help but remind people of the statements made by McElroy and others.

Good relations between countries are built through unremitting efforts, meticulousness, and patience. This process has already had a good start. Those who stubbornly cling to the "Cold War" position are clearly unable to keep up with the times.

    赫鲁晓夫复函世界科学工作者协会代表团
　　苏联愿立即签订停止核试验协定
　　各国人民正殷切期望国际局势有所缓和
　　美国一些人物却大叫大嚷要恢复核试验
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫5日在给世界科学工作者协会代表团的复信中指出，苏联愿意立即签订关于停止核试验的协定。
    赫鲁晓夫在5月间接见了世界科学工作者协会代表团，并就停止核武器试验问题同代表团进行了交谈。后来，赫鲁晓夫收到一封由十八名世界著名科学家署名的信件。这些科学家包括鲍威尔和贝尔纳（英国）、皮埃尔（法国）、托普切夫（苏联）、马哈拉诺比斯（印度）、周培源（中国）、小川（日本）、丹涅什（波兰）等。他们在信中对由于军备竞赛和继续试验核武器而产生的严重危险表示忧虑。他们要求立即缔结停止试验核武器的国际协定。
    赫鲁晓夫于11日在莫斯科发表的给科学家的复信中指出，苏联政府认为缔结停止核试验的协定有重大意义，并把这种协定看作是在裁军和使国际局势正常化方面采取进一步的、更广泛的措施的最重要的步骤。
    苏联政府首脑指出，在苏、美、英三国在日内瓦举行的关于停止核武器试验的会议中，苏联曾作了很大的努力，以求达成协议。由于苏联方面的主动，会议取得了某些进展，但是主要的困难还没有得到克服。
    赫鲁晓夫在复信中指出，要想使会议取得完全的成功，美国和英国的代表也必须有合作的诚意和达到会议目的的愿望。
    据新华社12日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦11日讯：塔斯社记者诺维科夫报道：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和美国总统艾森豪威尔即将相互访问的消息使全世界感到十分满意。各国人民把这一历史事件同缓和国际紧张局势的希望联系在一起，同停止军备竞赛和和平发展时期的到来联系在一起。各国在这个时候又重新发出要求停止试验核武器的呼声，并不是偶然的。
    但是，不久前西方报纸报道说，美国某些担任着十分重要职务的人士主张恢复核武器试验。尽管在日内瓦正在继续谈判，以便达成关于普遍停止核武器试验的协议。
    例如，美国国会两院原子能研究联席委员会主席、参议员安德逊8月5日说：美国可能在10月31日以后恢复核试验。在这以前，美国政府原子能委员会主席麦康也大嚷大叫地谈到这一点。后来，美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊在8月6日的谈话证实了上述言论。据“纽约时报”报道，麦克耳罗伊特别谈到：“如果一年的禁期在10月份满期时，还没有就核武器试验问题同苏联达成协议的话，那么就有希望恢复核试验。”
    这种叫嚷自然可能引起合理的不安，何况当这种叫嚷是出自麦克耳罗伊、安德逊和麦康那些有影响的官方人士的口中的时候。
    日内瓦国联大厦的新闻界人士说，美国出席不继续试验核武器会议的代表曾建议讨论这种不符合美国在停止核试验问题上的真正政策的言论。如果是这样的话，倒是件令人欣慰的事。
    但是，美国“纽约时报”7月21日的报道证明，在马昭尔群岛中的恩尼威托克岛屿上正在筹建一个核武器试验场，并为这项工程拨款九百万美元，而在内华达州则正在挖掘隧道以便进行地下核爆炸。
    另一方面，美国代表团在会议上长期不答复苏联关于事先商定调查机构数目的建议，这就是会议不能取得进展的主要原因。这些事实不由得使人想起麦克耳罗伊和其他人的言论。
    国与国之间的良好关系是由不懈的努力，细致和耐心地建立起来的。这个过程已经有了良好的开端。那些死死抱住“冷战”地位不放的人，显然是不能随着时代前进的。
