Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    A convalescent home for demobilized veterans with chronic diseases, under construction in the capital, has had most of its work completed and will soon be able to accept patients.
    This convalescent home is located near Yuetan Park in the suburbs of Beijing and is divided into three sections: tuberculosis, heart disease, and general chronic diseases, with 200 beds.
    In addition to medical facilities, the convalescent home also has a spacious auditorium and club. In the quiet courtyard, peach, willow, and pomegranate trees are planted, along with various flowers such as cannas, tuberoses, and crabapples. The lush greenery and fragrant flowers create an environment suitable for recuperation.
    Most of the doctors, nurses, and administrative staff serving in this convalescent home have been fully equipped. Most of them are demobilized and transferred military personnel who have recently returned from the troops. They are currently preparing to welcome their comrades to recuperate here.
