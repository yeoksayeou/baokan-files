Glorious Tradition Education Bears Fruit
“Wolf’s Teeth Mountain Five Heroes” Company Retains Honorary Title

(Our Dispatch) The company where the "Wolf's Teeth Mountain Five Heroes" were during the Anti-Japanese War, often uses the heroic fighting history and glorious traditions of the company to educate new soldiers, greatly improving the political consciousness of the soldiers and promoting work.

This company is the company of the famous "Wolf's Teeth Mountain Five Heroes" during the Anti-Japanese War. They cherish the glorious history of the entire army and their company, and often focus on the education of glorious traditions. Every year when new recruits join the army, the instructor first explains the military history, the company commander tells the company's combat stories, and the deputy company commander explains the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. In addition, Wang Anke, a second-class meritorious veteran, is invited to introduce how the company has maintained the true qualities of a heroic company in regular training. In order to cooperate with traditional education, the club organizes exhibitions, hanging up award banners, certificates of merit, and honor rolls, and explaining their origins. They also produce blackboard newspapers, big-character posters, comic strips, etc. At the "Welcoming Newcomers Evening," they perform programs such as "Wolf's Teeth Mountain Five Heroes," "Lone Courage Hero," "Unity of Officers and Soldiers," and "Unity of Military and Civilians." Through these activities, the new soldiers have a preliminary understanding of the glorious traditions of our army, and they all feel that joining the People's Liberation Army is very glorious. When new recruit Feng Xingyi first joined the army, he felt that the life in the army was too tense, and he was afraid of hardship and fatigue. The squad leader educated him on the nature of the People's Army, saying: "We are the people's army, we don't care about eating or wearing, we are not afraid of hardship or fatigue, and we are wholeheartedly for the people. For example, the 'Wolf's Teeth Mountain Five Heroes' heroically resisted the enemy and jumped off the cliff when they ran out of ammunition and supplies. What were they doing it for? Wasn't it for the people?" After listening to these reasons, the new recruit improved his awareness. When old soldiers retire, they also carry out traditional education, calling on everyone to maintain and carry forward the glory. Therefore, many old soldiers have become model workers after returning to their production posts. This company conducts traditional education every year during the "welcoming new recruits" and "sending off old soldiers" periods.

Every year on the "August 1st" Army Day, leading cadres give a more systematic explanation of the development history of our army from scratch, from small to large, and from weak to strong under the leadership of the Party. September 25th is the day when the "Wolf's Teeth Mountain Five Heroes" heroically jumped off the cliff. Every year on this day, the Seventh Company holds a meeting to commemorate and publicize their heroic deeds. The Seventh Company and Comrade Ge Zhenlin, one of the "Wolf's Teeth Mountain Five Heroes," have maintained contact over the years. In July of this year, Comrade Ge Zhenlin came to the Seventh Company for a special visit, which gave the troops great education and encouragement.

This company also combines education on the nature of the People's Army and the principles of army building. Every year, they check the relationship between officers and soldiers once or twice, and carry forward the glorious tradition of unity between officers and soldiers and unity between superiors and subordinates in our army. And they repeatedly publicize the vivid deeds of the company "going south for three thousand miles and being united like brothers." Therefore, the relationship between officers and soldiers in this company has always been relatively good. The company commander helps the groom chop grass and feed the horses; the instructor and deputy company commander weed and water the fields together with the soldiers. The soldiers respect the cadres very much.

This company also often educates the troops with the principle of unity between the military and the people. They have established contact with a production brigade, and often take some time to help the masses with production and learn from the masses. Because the troops understand that the relationship between the military and the people is like fish and water, cadres and soldiers actively participate as long as they hear that they are helping the people. Recently, the masses lacked transportation capacity to deliver public grain, and the company drew out forty soldiers from the tense construction tasks to help the masses deliver public grain. Because the relationship between the military and the people is good, the local area has given the Seventh Company more than a dozen silk banners.

Because this company attaches importance to traditional education, it has carried forward the glorious traditions of our army in various tasks. In recent years, they have added many new honors. In 1955, the higher authorities awarded the honorary title of "Second-Class Training Model Company"; in 1958, it was rated as a "Five-Good Company" and won an award banner of "Promoting Military Democracy and Improving Training Quality." Now, the Seventh Company has a total of forty silk banners and ten certificates of merit.

    光荣传统教育开花结果
    “狼牙山五壮士”所在连队保持荣誉称号
    本报讯　抗日战争时期的“狼牙山五壮士”的所在连队，经常以本连的英勇斗争历史和光荣传统向新战士进行教育，大大提高了战士的政治觉悟，推动了工作。
    这个连队是抗日战争时期著名的“狼牙山五壮士”所在的连队，他们十分珍惜全军和本连的光荣历史，经常抓紧光荣传统的教育。每年新兵入伍，他们都首先由指导员讲解军史，连长讲述本连的战斗故事，副连长讲解三大纪律八项注意。此外，还请二等功臣王安科介绍本连在正规训练中怎样保持了英雄连队的本色。俱乐部为了配合传统教育，组织展览会，把奖旗、奖状、光荣榜都挂起来，并说明它的来历。他们还出黑板报、大字报、连环画等。在“迎新晚会”上，演唱“狼牙山五壮士”、“独胆英雄”、“官兵一致”、“军民一致”等节目。通过这些活动，使新战士对我军的光荣传统有了初步认识，都感到参加解放军是非常光荣的。新战士冯兴艺刚入伍时，嫌部队的生活紧张，怕苦、怕累。班长就向他进行了人民军队性质的教育，对他说：“我们是人民的军队，不讲吃，不讲穿，不怕苦，不怕累，一心为人民。比如‘狼牙山五壮士’英勇抗击敌人，在弹尽路绝时跳崖。人家为了啥？还不是为了人民。”这个新战士听了这些道理，提高了觉悟。老战士退伍时，也进行传统教育，号召大家保持光荣，发扬光荣。因此，不少老战士回到生产岗位以后，成了劳动模范。这个连队，年年在“迎新”“送老”的时候进行传统教育。
    每年的“八一”建军节，都由领导干部比较系统地讲解我军在党的领导下，从无到有、从小到大、从弱到强的发展历史。9月25日，是“狼牙山五壮士”壮烈跳崖的日子，每年的这一天，七连都开会纪念，宣扬英雄事迹。七连和“狼牙山五壮士”之一葛振林同志，几年来一直保持着通信联系。今年7月，葛振林同志来七连专门进行了访问。给部队很大教育和鼓舞。
    这个连队还结合进行人民军队性质和建军原则的教育。每年检查一、两次官兵关系，发扬我军官兵一致、上下一致的光荣传统。并且反复宣传本连“南下三千里、团结如兄弟”的生动事迹。所以，这个连队的官兵关系一直是比较好的。连长帮助驭手铡草喂马；指导员、副连长和战士一同锄草、浇地。战士对干部很尊重。
    这个连队还经常以军民一致的原则教育部队，他们和一个生产大队建立了联系，经常抽出一定的时间帮助群众生产，向群众学习。由于部队懂得军和民是鱼水的关系，因此，只要听说是帮助老百姓作事情，干部、战士都是积极参加。最近，群众送公粮缺乏运输力，连里在紧张的施工任务中抽出四十名战士，帮助群众送公粮。因为军民关系好，地方上赠给七连十几面锦旗。
    由于这个连队重视了传统教育，在各项工作中发扬了我军的光荣传统。几年来，他们又增添了不少新的荣誉。1955年，上级授予
  “二级训练模范连”的光荣称号；1958年，被评为“五好连队”，并获得“发扬军事民主，提高训练质量”的奖旗一面。现在，七连共有四十面锦旗和十个奖状。
