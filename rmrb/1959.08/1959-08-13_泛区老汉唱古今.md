　　Old Man Yu of the Pan-flooded Area Sings of Past and Present
　　(Henan Zhui Zi) In mid-July's sweltering heat, I, Yu Dashuan, returned to Henan to visit relatives and friends. People said the face of the Yellow River's flooded area had greatly changed, so I hurried to see for myself. As I walked along, I looked around, and I couldn't help but like what I saw more and more. The roads were so flat, with green willows and locust trees planted on both sides. The fields were green and vast, and the wind blew the sorghum stalks, bending them at the waist. The cotton plants were over two and a half feet tall, with peanuts interplanted in between. Here, the corn grew strong and healthy, and there, eggplants, peppers, a vegetable garden. In front, yellow cattle frolicked on the ground; behind, golden wheat straw was piled high like mountains. I regretted coming a bit late, not having seen the vast wheat fields rippling in the wind. Thinking and walking, I hurried forward, and I saw the commune members working in the fields. Men and women were working hard, chasing and catching up with each other, never stopping. They sang folk songs with cheerful hearts, all because this year's harvest was better than last year's. I couldn't get enough of the scenery along the way; each and every thing was so new. Just as I couldn't help but praise aloud, someone behind me spoke. It turned out to be an old man with white hair. Judging by his age, he was sixty-two or three. He said, "Comrade, slow down a bit. See how the scorching sun is overhead, so stifling and hot. It's best to rest for a while and stop the sweat. Be careful of heatstroke, that could be troublesome." We two rested under the willow shade, chatting with each other. He said, "This place is very noticeable now, but the suffering of the past is unspeakable. A disaster fell from the sky, back in 1938, when Chiang Kai-shek breached the dikes of the Yellow River, and the yellow water flooded down. So many families suffered, so many people fled famine. Those who drowned and starved were countless; as far as the eye could see, there was no one. I'm an old man with a short lifespan, escaping with my son to Xi'an. After the water receded, I returned home, my heart sour with desolation. I couldn't even find the shadow of my home, just a stretch of yellow sand meeting the sky. Deep weeds covered the roads, and muddy ponds made it hard to step. Since the People's Liberation Army came to our Xihua County, it was truly like parting the clouds and seeing the blue sky. They led the masses to reclaim wasteland and produce, whoever planted reaped, rebuilding their homes. In these years, production has greatly developed, and the hard days are gone forever. In the past, the Yellow River brought disaster; now, golden wheat waves welcome the wind. In the past, it was bitterness and sorrowful faces; now, it's a sweet and happy life." The old man spoke with excitement, his mouth watering, and I listened with joy. It was getting late, so I bid farewell to the old man and hurried on, wanting to visit other parts of the flooded area.

　　泛区老汉唱古今
　　（河南坠子）　余大拴七月中旬大热天，寻亲访友我回到河南，人说是黄泛区面貌大改变，我急忙忙赶着去参观。一路走来我一路看，不由我越看越喜欢，一条条大路多平坦，绿柳洋槐栽两边。田野青青一大片，风吹高粱把腰弯。棉花棵高有两尺半，花生夹种在中间。这里是玉米长得好壮健，那里是茄子辣椒一菜园。往前看黄牛嬉戏在地面，往后看金黄麦秸堆成山。恨的是我来晚一点，未得见千里麦浪翻。想着走着我往前赶，又看见社员们耕作在田间。男的女的都在加油干，你追我赶不停闲。口唱山歌心情多舒展，皆因是今年丰收胜去年。沿途景色看不厌，一桩桩一件件甚是新鲜。我正在忍不住连声赞叹，身后忽然有人把话言。原来是白发苍苍一老汉。看年纪六十有二三。他说道：同志慢些把路赶，你看烈日当头闷炎炎，最好是休息一阵止止汗，要当心中暑热可就麻烦。我二人歇息在柳荫下面，你言我语来攀谈。他说：这地方现在很显眼，提起过去苦难说不完。平地里落下了灾难一件，那是在一九三八年，蒋介石扒开了黄河堤岸，黄水滔滔往下淹。多少人家遭了难，多少人逃荒在外边。淹死的饿死的难以计算，举目一望无人烟。我老汉还算命不短，跟儿子逃命到西安。水退后我才回家转，满目凄凉我心发酸。要找家影子都不见，一片黄沙接着天。荒草深深把路掩，淤潭处处迈步难。自从解放军来到咱西华县，真个是拨开云雾见青天。领导群众开荒生产，谁种谁收重建家园。这几年生产大发展，苦日子一去不回还，从前是黄水滔滔降灾难，而今是金黄麦浪迎风翻。从前是苦中苦愁眉苦脸，而今是幸福生活甜又甜。老汉说得眉飞色舞口水溅，我一旁乐滋滋听着也喜欢。天色不早辞别老汉把路赶，还要到泛区各地去参观。
