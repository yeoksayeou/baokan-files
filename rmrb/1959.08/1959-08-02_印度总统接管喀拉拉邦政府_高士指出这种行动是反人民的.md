Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 31st. Indian President Prasad formally signed a proclamation on the evening of July 31st, announcing that he was taking over the administrative power of the Kerala State government.

In this proclamation, he said that after receiving the report from the Governor of Kerala State and considering the report and other information, "I am certain that a situation has arisen in which the government of this state cannot continue to exist in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Constitution."

He announced that he himself would hold all the powers of the aforementioned state government and all the powers granted to the Governor and others, or that they could exercise.

According to earlier news, the Indian Cabinet made the decision to recommend that the President take over the Kerala State government after holding two days of meetings.

The agitation movement launched by the opposition parties and other forces in Kerala State with the aim of overthrowing the Kerala State government had lasted exactly fifty days by the time the Indian President issued this proclamation. After this proclamation, the Kerala State government led by the Communist Party of India, which had been established for twenty-eight months, would be dissolved immediately.

It is reported that before the Indian President announced the dissolution of the Kerala State government, the state government submitted the Land Relations Bill passed by the State Legislative Assembly to the Indian President on July 30th, requesting the President's approval.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 1st. On the same evening (July 31st) that the Indian President signed the proclamation to take over the Kerala State government in New Delhi, the Governor of Kerala State, Rao, took over the state government in Trivandrum.

According to a report from the Press Trust of India from Trivandrum, Kerala State Chief Minister Namboodiripad issued a statement after leaving his post, saying that he and his colleagues "regretted to learn that the President had accepted the opinion of his cabinet." He pointed out that the responsibility of those who care about maintaining democracy is to "strive to repel this first major attack on local autonomy and on the right of a non-Congress party to organize a government (if it has the confidence of the legislature)."

Namboodiripad assured the people that "whether we are in office or not, we will work for the same cause, the promotion of which was why we took office twenty-eight months ago."

Namboodiripad pointed out that the great restraint shown by the Communists and the people in the past few weeks "has won the state government the favor of a large part of democratic public opinion."

After bidding farewell to the State Government Secretariat on the evening of July 31st, Namboodiripad expressed his gratitude for the cooperation of the officials and staff, who gathered on the lawn of the Secretariat office building to see Namboodiripad and others off.

It is reported that the agitation movement carried out by the opposition parties in Kerala State continued until the last day before the state government was dissolved. In Trivandrum and other counties, rioters set fire to schools and some shops. Various opposition parties and caste leaders also planned to hold "victory celebration" activities.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 1st. The General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, Ghosh, said at a mass meeting held here on the evening of July 31st that the proclamation issued by the Indian President to take over the Kerala State government "undermined" India's "democracy" and was "unconstitutional."

Ghosh said this at the meeting after the President signed the proclamation. He also said that overthrowing the only non-Congress party government in an Indian state was "a moral failure of the Congress party" because "this action has caused the Congress party's prestige to suffer losses it has never suffered before."

Ghosh pointed out that this action is anti-people and "punishes the people of Kerala State for voting for the Communist Party." When he talked about the Congress party's demand for mid-term elections in Kerala State, he said, "The Congress party headquarters wanted the Communist government to commit suicide, otherwise they would be eliminated by the central government."

Ghosh announced that the central government's actions will not change the policies and programs adopted by the Communist Party of India at the Amritsar Congress, which took into account domestic and international forces when adopting these policies. He said that the Communist Party of India will strive to mobilize all progressive forces—including progressive forces within the Congress party—to defeat all the conspiracies of the reactionaries.

Ghosh also called on Communist Party members and people who cherish democracy to be vigilant against the conspiracies of the reactionaries.

    印度总统接管喀拉拉邦政府
    高士指出这种行动是反人民的
    新华社新德里31日电　印度总统普拉沙德7月31日晚上正式签署了一项公告，宣布他接管了喀拉拉邦政府的行政权。
    他在这项公告中说，在接到喀拉拉邦邦长的报告并且考虑了报告和其他的情报后，“我确信产生了一种局势，在这种局势中，按照印度宪法的规定，不能使这个邦的政府继续存在”。
    他宣布，他自己执掌了上述邦政府的所有职权，并且执掌了授与邦长和其他人的、或者他们可以行使的一切权力。
    据早些时候的消息，印度内阁在举行了两天会议后，作出了建议总统接管喀拉拉邦政府的决定。
    喀拉拉邦反对党和其他势力发动的目的在于推翻喀拉拉邦政府的煽动运动到印度总统发表这项公告时，刚好五十天。这项公告宣布后，成立了二十八个月的、由印度共产党领导的喀拉拉邦政府将立即被解散。
    据报道，在印度总统宣布解散喀拉拉邦政府以前，邦政府曾在7月30日向印度总统提出邦立法会议通过的土地关系法案，请总统批准。
    新华社新德里1日电　在印度总统在新德里签署接管喀拉拉邦政府的公告的同一天晚上（7月31日），喀拉拉邦邦长拉奥在特里凡得琅接管了邦政府。
    据印度报业托辣斯自特里凡得琅报道，喀拉拉邦政府首席部长南布迪里巴德在离开他的职务以后发表声明说，他和他的同事们“遗憾地获悉总统接受了他的内阁的意见。”他指出，关心维护民主的人的责任是，“努力击退这种对地方自治和对非国大党组织政府的权利（如果它得到立法机关的信任的话）所进行的首次大进攻。”
    南布迪里巴德向人民保证，“不论我们是否在职，我们将为同一个事业努力，我们在二十八个月以前就职就是为了促进这个事业。”
    南布迪里巴德指出，共产党员和人民在过去几个星期中所表现的很大的克制态度“使邦政府获得很大部分的民主舆论的好感。”
    南布迪里巴德7月31日晚上向邦政府秘书处告别后，对官员们和工作人员们的合作表示感谢，他们聚集在秘书处办公楼的草地上为南布迪里巴德等送行。
    据报道，喀拉拉邦反对党所进行的煽动运动一直继续到邦政府被解散前的最后一天。在特里凡得琅和其他县，暴徒们纵火焚烧了学校和一些商店。各反对党和教族领袖还计划举行“庆祝胜利”的活动。
    新华社新德里1日电　印度共产党总书记高士7月31日晚上在这里举行的群众大会上发表讲话时说，印度总统发布的接管喀拉拉邦政府的公告“破坏了”印度的“民主”，而且是“不符合宪法的”。
    高士是在总统签署了这项公告以后在会上这样说的。他还说，推翻印度一个邦的唯一的非国大党政府无宁是“国大党道义上的失败”，因为“这次行动使国大党的威信遭到了以前从未受到过的损失”。
    高士指出，这种行动是反人民的，“是惩罚喀拉拉邦的人民，因为他们投了共产党的票”。他在谈到国大党曾经提出的要喀拉拉邦举行期中选举的要求时说，“国大党总部想使共产党政府自杀，否则他们就将被中央干掉。”
    高士宣布，中央政府的行动不会使印度共产党在阿姆利则大会上所通过的政策和纲领有任何改变，采取这种政策时考虑到了国内和国际上的力量。他说，印度共产党将努力动员一切进步力量——包括国大党内的进步力量——来击败反动分子的一切阴谋。
    高士还要求共产党员和爱护民主的人士对反动分子的阴谋保持警惕。
