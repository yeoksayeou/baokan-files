    A Brief Biography of Silkworms
    Yang Min
    When did silkworms first start to exist in the world? It is difficult to say now. However, historical records all say that when the Yellow Emperor established his capital in Youxiong (now Xinzheng County, Henan), his primary consort, Leizu, was the first to teach the people how to raise silkworms. Therefore, for the progenitor of domestic silkworms, we might as well recognize them as the batch of wild silkworms that people first collected from wild mulberry trees during Leizu's time. Their place of origin is the Yellow River basin.
  Domesticating silkworms was the first major event in their history. From then on, the silkworms' lives were guaranteed, natural enemies could no longer invade, and their offspring proliferated. By the time of Yu the Great, most of the tributes from the Nine Provinces were silk fabrics. The "Book of Songs" says "Bringing cloth to trade for silk," which shows that there was already a silk market at that time. At the very latest, about three thousand years ago, the silkworm population had grown considerably. Before the Zhou Dynasty, only China knew how to use silk, but later it gradually spread to foreign countries. During the Qin Dynasty, silk went to Korea with the army. When Xu Fu went to Penglai to seek the elixir of immortality, he probably also took silk with him, so the Japanese saw silk for the first time. When Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty opened up the Western Regions, silk was successively introduced to Central Asia and India. However, only silk was transmitted at that time, not silkworms. It was not until around 550 AD that two Persian (now Iranian) monks in our country painstakingly hid silkworm eggs in their canes and brought them abroad for the first time.
    Silkworms eat mulberry leaves, so for the sake of the silkworms, people tried every means to plant mulberry forests extensively. As for food, clothing, warmth, health, disease, and death, they took care of them meticulously. For example, silkworms are cold-blooded animals, afraid of both heat and cold. In the past, there were no thermometers, so people had to wear single layers of clothing and live with the silkworms, feeling cold when the silkworms were cold, and hot when the silkworms were hot, and adjusting the temperature of the silkworm rearing room accordingly. No wonder people used to call those who cared for silkworms "silkworm mothers," and even today, they are still called "silkworm babies"! People's only expectation is to wait for them to grow and become strong, and spin more silk.
    Mulberry leaves contain lutein. When silkworms eat mulberry leaves, the lutein passes through the digestive tract into the blood, and then to the silk glands. The secreted silk has a beautiful yellow color. The digestive tracts or silk glands of some silkworms cannot allow lutein and other pigments to pass through, so even though they eat the same mulberry leaves, the silk they spin is pure white. Some silkworms can use the pigments in mulberry leaves as raw materials to synthesize other pigments, which can form green, red, bamboo green and other colored cocoons. But more importantly, silk can absorb dyes very well.
    Silk is composed of two silk fibers, and each silk fiber is woven from fifty to one hundred and fifty smaller silk fibers. The diameter is smaller than one-tenth of a human hair, but the strength is stronger than iron wire of the same thickness. The small fibers are intertwined with each other, but there are many gaps, which allows the silk to absorb water and color... It is also because of this structure, and because the texture is a special protein, that it is light and soft, heat-resistant and acid-resistant. In addition to being suitable for weaving clothing, it is now widely used in the manufacture of parachutes, tire cores, surgical sutures, powder sieves, fishing nets, etc.
    Under the influence of different environments, silkworms have gradually produced many variations. About two thousand years ago, people began to domesticate tussah silkworms. Later, ailanthus silkworms, eri silkworms, and castor silkworms were also utilized. This greatly increased the opportunity for silkworm hybridization. Song Yingxing's "Tiangong Kaiwu" in the Ming Dynasty says: "If a white male is paired with a yellow female, their offspring will become brown cocoons," and also says: "Silkworms also have several forms, pure white, tiger striped, pure black, patterned... Nowadays, some poor families pair early males with late females, creating excellent varieties, which is a strange thing." It can be seen that our country has known for a long time that hybridization can change the morphology and quality of silkworms. In modern times, when ailanthus silkworms and castor silkworms are matched, the tensile strength of the silkworm's silk has been significantly enhanced. It not only eats the stinky ailanthus leaves that ailanthus silkworms love, but also likes to gnaw on the castor beans that castor silkworms like. When willow silkworms and tussah silkworms marry, their offspring may lose some of the wildness of willow silkworms to a certain extent, while also gaining the advantages of good quality and high quantity of tussah silk. In short, due to hybridization, silkworms are learning from each other's strengths and compensating for their weaknesses, and are rapidly improving according to human wishes.
    In recent years, silkworms have even eaten penicillin for the first time. As a result, they have become stronger and fatter, spun cocoons earlier, increased the silk content of the cocoons, and significantly reduced softening disease. Not long ago, our students studying in the Soviet Union also skillfully completed silkworm endocrine gland transplantation surgery, which is of great help in improving silkworm productivity. It is reported that a modern silkworm industry experimental station has also been built in the southern foothills of the Greater Khingan Mountains to cultivate cold-resistant and early-maturing silkworm breeds. Silkworms are now also undergoing a great reform, in order to better serve mankind!

    蚕儿小传
    杨旻
    蚕儿是什么时候开始在世界上生长起来的？已很难说。不过史书上都说：黄帝建都于有熊（今河南新郑县）时，元妃嫘祖才最先教民养蚕。所以对于家蚕的始祖，倒不妨认它们就是嫘祖时人们第一次从野桑上采回来的那批野蚕。它们的发祥地，则是黄河流域。
  蚕儿家养，这是它们历史上第一件大事。从此蚕儿的生活有了保障，天敌无法再侵扰，子孙繁衍起来，夏禹时，九州的贡物已大部是丝织品；“诗经”上说“抱布贸丝”，可见当时已有蚕丝市场，至迟在三千年左右以前，蚕儿的队伍已相当壮大。周代以前，利用蚕丝还只是中国知道，后来则逐渐传播到了外国；秦始皇时候，蚕丝随军去到了朝鲜。徐福往蓬莱求仙药，大概也带了蚕丝去，日本人这才第一次看到了蚕丝。汉武帝通西域，蚕丝又相继传入中亚细亚和印度等地。不过那时候传去的只是丝而不是蚕。直到公元550年左右，才亏了两位在我国的波斯（今伊朗）和尚，苦心孤诣地把蚕子隐藏在手杖中，第一次带到了外国。
    蚕要吃桑叶，为了蚕，人们便千方百计地广植桑林。至于饥寒温饱、疾病伤亡，更照顾得无微不至。例如蚕是冷血动物，既怕热，又怕寒，从前没有寒暑表，人们便只好穿着单衣，和蚕儿共处，人寒蚕寒，人热蚕热，据此而进行蚕室温度的调节。无怪乎从前要称护理蚕儿的人为“蚕母”，至今也还有叫蚕儿为“蚕宝宝”的！人们唯一的期望，就是等待着它们成长壮大，多多抽出点丝来。
    桑叶中含有叶黄素，蚕儿吃桑，叶黄素便通过消食管，进入血液，再到绢丝腺，泌出的丝便具有美丽的黄色。有些蚕儿的消食管或绢丝腺不能让叶黄素和其他色素透过，虽同样吃桑，抽出的丝却洁白无瑕。有些蚕儿则能利用桑叶中的色素为原料，合成其他的色素，这就能形成绿、红、竹青等色茧。但更重要的是蚕丝能很好地吸收染料。
    蚕丝都是由两支丝纤维组合而成，而每支丝纤维又各由五十至一百五十条更小的丝纤维编织而成，直径比头发的十分之一还小，强度则比同粗的铁丝还强。小纤维彼此交错，但又留有许多空隙，这就使丝能吸水、上色……。也正由于这种结构，质地又是一种特殊的蛋白质，因此轻而柔软，耐热抗酸。除了适于织造服饰，现在还广泛地被用于制造降落伞、车胎内芯，医用缝线，粉筛、渔网等……
    在不同环境的影响之下，蚕儿也逐渐产生了许多变种。二千年前左右，人们又开始进行驯化柞蚕，以后，樗蚕、柳蚕、蓖麻蚕等也先后被利用起来。这就大大增加了蚕儿杂交的机会。明朝宋应星的“天工开物”一书说：“若将白雄配黄雌，则其嗣变成褐茧”又说：“凡蚕形亦有纯白、虎斑、纯黑、花纹数种……今寒家有将早雄配晚雌者，幻出嘉种，一异也”，可见我国很早就知道杂交可以改变蚕儿的形态和品质。到近代，樗蚕和蓖麻蚕相配，蚕宝宝的丝的拉力已显著增强，它既会吃樗蚕喜爱的臭椿叶，也喜欢啃蓖麻蚕嗜好的蓖麻。柳蚕和柞蚕成婚，子裔便可能在一定程度上失去柳蚕的野性，同时又取得柞蚕丝质好量多的特点。总之，由于进行了杂交，蚕儿们正在彼此取长补短，按着人类的愿望在迅速改良着。
    近年来，蚕儿还破天荒吃到了青霉素。它们曾因此而变得更结实、肥壮，结茧提早，茧的含丝量增加，并显著减少了软化病。不久前，我国的留苏学生又巧妙地完成了蚕儿内分泌腺的移植手术，对蚕儿生产率的提高有很大帮助。报载大兴安岭南麓也建成了现代化的蚕业试验站，要培养出耐寒、早熟的蚕种。蚕儿现在也正在经历着伟大的改革，为了更好地为人类服务！
