    Between Courtyards
    陶钝
    Because of her high blood pressure and qualifying age, I persuaded my wife to retire. How to arrange her daily life after retirement became a serious problem. A person who has experienced long-term work cannot stand being idle all of a sudden. I wanted to change her personality, enticing her to watch movies, dramas, and visit parks, etc.; but she disliked movies for making her dizzy, and couldn't understand the dramas; she didn't want to go out because there were too many people in the park and crowded buses.
    There were some empty spaces in the yard, which were dug up and sunned in the spring. I suggested planting some flowers, and she suggested planting some vegetables. After some arguing, we decided to plant both flowers and vegetables. We planted some oleander, night-blooming jasmine, canna lilies, passionflower, etc.; and also planted some bok choy, broad beans, tomatoes, string beans, etc. Every day when she got up, before brushing her teeth or washing her face, she would inspect the flowers and vegetables. Those who advocated planting vegetables also looked at the flowers, and those who advocated planting flowers also ate the vegetables. Flowers grown by oneself are fragrant, and vegetables grown by oneself are sweet.
    This still couldn't occupy all her spirit, so we got a little grandson for her to look after. She was quite interested in taking care of the little grandson, which took up a lot of her time. In addition to buying some toys, she also wanted to get two small animals for the little grandson to play with. I suggested buying two white jade birds or budgerigars. She disagreed, and she advocated buying a few chicks. This time she won, and she went to buy the chicks. A group of milky yellow little things, walking unsteadily, the little grandson liked it very much, reaching out to grab them, grabbing the chicks until they chirped, almost killing them. When the chicks grew up, they pooped, which affected hygiene and cleanliness. She looked everywhere for sunflower stalks, and after getting enough, she tied a chicken coop in a corner of the yard. Bamboo baskets couldn't hold them anymore, so she collected bricks to build a house for the chickens. After it was built, it wasn't a big deal, but for a period of time, the yard was simply a construction site.
    In this way, a year passed, and the five hens she raised laid eggs. The habit of hens after laying eggs is to cluck for a while. I was awakened by its sudden sound in the midst of writing, and I felt very annoyed. But my wife came in holding an egg in her palm and said, "Look, it laid an egg!" The red and white, bright egg did not change my annoyance, so I said, "What's so great about this? Clucking like it's showing off, it's annoying." What did she say? "You feel annoyed when you hear it, but I think it sounds quite nice!" Even though I didn't want to raise chickens, I still complained about the chickens clucking after laying eggs, but I still ate a lot of eggs.
    At this time, I suddenly thought of a story about Chen Zhongzi in Mencius' book. Chen Zhongzi was called a "righteous scholar" at the time, not taking a single straw stick from others, nor giving a single straw stick to others. One day, Chen Zhongzi went to his elder brother's house, and his sister-in-law was feeding some geese. The geese were honking, and Chen Zhongzi became impatient and said:
   "What's the point of raising these honking things!" The next time he went to his elder brother's house, his sister-in-law made him food, and he ate very deliciously. His sister-in-law pointed to a bowl of vegetables and said, "This is the meat of those honking things!" Saying these sarcastic words to the "righteous scholar" was unbearable for Chen Zhongzi. He left his elder brother's house and vomited out the goose meat. The book doesn't say how he vomited it out, and we shouldn't speculate. I don't want to be a "righteous scholar" like Chen Zhongzi. I ate the eggs without any qualms, and my attitude towards raising chickens has changed somewhat. Before and after going to and from work, I also helped mix chicken feed and take care of the chickens, unwilling to wear this hat of not working and eating. (Attached picture)

    庭院之间  
    陶钝
    我的爱人因为高血压症，年龄也及格了，说服她办理了退休。退休以后她的日常生活怎样安排倒成了严重的问题。一个经历长期工作的人，忽然要她闲起来是闲不住的。我想转变她那性格，引逗她看电影、戏剧，逛公园等；可是她，看电影嫌晕眼，看戏听不懂；公园里人多，公共汽车拥挤她不愿出门。
    院子里有些空地，春天到了刨起来晒着。我主张栽些花，她主张种些菜，争持了一阵，还是也栽花也种菜。栽了些夹竹桃、夜来香、美人蕉、西番莲等；也种了些小白菜、蚕豆、西红柿、豆角等。她每天起床，口还没嗽，脸还没洗就把花菜巡视一遍。主张种菜的也看花，主张种花的也吃菜。花是自己栽的香，菜是自己种的甜。
    这样还不能占住她全部的精神，又弄了个小孙孙来给她看顾。弄小孙孙她倒满有兴趣，分去了她不少的时间。除了买一些玩具以外，还要弄两个小动物给小孙子玩玩。我主张买两只白玉鸟或者虎皮鹦哥。她不同意，她主张买几只小鸡。这次还是她胜利了，她去买了小鸡来。乳黄的一群小东西，蹒跚地走着，小孙子看了很喜欢，伸手就抓，抓得小鸡唧唧的叫，差点抓死。小鸡大了拉屎，防碍卫生和清洁，她到处找朝阳花秆子，弄的够用了就在院子的一角缚了一个鸡栏。竹篓子盛不开它们了，她就搜集砖头，给鸡修房子。修成以后倒没有什么，有一个时期院子里简直成了工地。
    这样一年过去了，养的五只母鸡下蛋了，下过蛋的母鸡习惯是咯哒咯哒叫一阵，我在写作的沉思中，被它蓦地一声惊醒，心情烦的很。可是我的爱人在手心里托着一个鸡蛋进来了，说：“你看下蛋啦！”又红又白鲜亮的鸡蛋没有改变我的心烦，就说道：“这有什么不得了，咯哒叫像表功似的，聒耳朵。”她怎么说呢？“你听了心烦，我听着还怪好听呢！”纵然不愿养鸡还嫌鸡下蛋咯哒，鸡蛋，我还是吃了不少。
    在这时忽然想起孟子书上有一段陈仲子的故事来。陈仲子在当时称为“廉士”，一根草棒不取人家的，一根草棒也不给人家。有一天陈仲子到哥哥家里去，嫂嫂喂了几只鹅，那鹅勾咯地叫，陈仲子听了不耐烦，就说：
  “养这勾咯叫的东西干啥呀！”再一次到哥哥家，嫂嫂做饭他吃，他吃的很香。嫂嫂指着一碗菜说：“这就是勾咯叫的那东西的肉哇！”对“廉士”说这带讽刺的话，陈仲子可受不了，出了哥哥家就把鹅肉呕吐出来了。怎样呕吐出来的书上没有写，我们也不好胡乱揣测。我究竟不愿作陈仲子这样的“廉士”。吃鸡蛋还是坦然地吃了，对养鸡的态度可有些转变，早晚上下班的前后，也帮着拌鸡食，照管鸡，不愿意戴这顶不劳而食的帽子。（附图片）
