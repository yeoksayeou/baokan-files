　　From Huayuankou to Garden
　　Liu Di
　　All the old folks from the Yellow River flooded area, whenever they mention Huayuankou, it's like mentioning a nightmare. Hearing the name Huayuankou, what appears before people's eyes is a vast expanse of water, the roaring Yellow River water like millions of wild beasts; it's a scene of darkness and despair, of ghosts crying and people wailing; it's about families ruined and people wandering everywhere; it's about hunger, cold, and death.

　　Twenty years!

　　In June 1938, the wheat was ripening on the Central Plains. Just as a wheat harvest was within reach, a tragic disaster struck. The Japanese devils were attacking Kaifeng. Chiang Kai-shek, with his passive resistance, in order to cover his own escape, viciously blew open the Yellow River dam at Huayuankou. Here, the Yellow River suddenly opened its ferocious mouth, and the Yellow River water poured southeast for thousands of miles, instantly swallowing countless fields and villages. Forty-four counties, 54,000 square kilometers on the Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu plains, became a vast ocean; the affected population was 12.5 million, with 890,000 deaths, and the original fertile land turned into a desolate "Yellow River flooded area." This shocking disaster had not yet been resolved, and in 1946, Chiang Kai-shek again viciously blocked the breach at Huayuankou to restore the dam, letting the Yellow River flood the liberated areas. At that time, the Yellow River dikes along the liberated areas had not been repaired for many years, and the dikes were leveled in many places. Fields were planted and villages were built in the river滩. If the Yellow River water rushed in, another inevitable disaster would occur. At that time, the people in the liberated areas downstream of the Yellow River put forward the slogan "Oppose Chiang and Govern the Yellow River," fighting the Kuomintang militarily while rushing to repair the dikes. The Kuomintang sent planes to bomb and strafe during the day, and dispatched special agents to sabotage at night. At that time, we didn't even have enough time to rush the repairs, but we still had to dig air-raid shelters and build fortifications on the dikes.

　　Thus, in the minds of the people of Henan, Shandong, and northern Anhui and Jiangsu, Huayuankou was the embodiment of disaster.

　　However, today, if you go to Huayuankou again, you will no longer see its original appearance. Starting from Hutun in the northern suburbs of Zhengzhou, walking onto the high Huayuankou Yellow River dike, a pleasant scene immediately unfolds before your eyes. Along the wide dike surface, rows of dense willows, locusts, cypresses, and phoenix trees grow, interspersed with some unknown shrubs and flowers, like a tree-lined avenue. Some say that from here, you can take a car along the dike all the way to the sea. Thick kudzu grass is planted on the dike slopes, like a narrow green carpet. Along the dike, there are also orchards, planted with apples, pears, grapes, peaches, apricots, etc. It is said that there are already twenty or thirty such orchards in the Huayuankou area. Standing on the Yellow River dike and looking far away, the crops on the plain within the dike are like a green ocean, and the rolling Yellow River water rushes down from Mangshan, with fleets of white-sailed boats transporting goods. The Huayuankou ferry crossing is a busy scene. Looking upstream, the Yellow River Bridge, more than ten kilometers away, is vaguely visible, like a cyan rainbow in the clouds.

　　Reflecting on the past and thinking about the present, people will not forget the disaster twenty years ago. Here, you can still see those remaining historical relics. The section of the river dike that the Kuomintang breached twenty-one years ago, more than a thousand meters long, has been built even more majestic and solid today. At the western end of this towering dike, a dilapidated little pavilion looks so cramped and ugly. This is the so-called memorial pavilion built by the Kuomintang when they blocked the breach at Huayuankou in 1947. In the past, there was a stone tablet in the pavilion with Chiang Kai-shek's brazen inscription: "Saving the Nation and Calming the Waters." But isn't this a huge lie? After liberation, the local masses removed this deceptive sign. Behind the pavilion, next to the river dike, there is a large pool, which was scoured out when the Yellow River breached in 1938. It has now become a fish pond for the Jingshui People's Commune, and lotus flowers will be planted here soon to build a water park.

　　Visiting Huayuankou, you will be reminded of infinite memories and longings by any small scene. What is most thought-provoking is the sound of the Yellow River water. Although the fierce Yellow River water impacts the dike with howls, it is still conquered by the heroic people. Not far to the west of where the Kuomintang breached the dike, there is a constant sound of water flowing, a sound so gentle. It turns out that there are two Yellow River irrigation canals here. The largest one is called the Dongfeng (East Wind) Canal, a product of last year's Great Leap Forward. The local masses completed this irrigation project with a flow rate of more than 300 cubic meters per second in just a few months. It is said that this main canal, plus twelve branch canals, is 638 kilometers long and can irrigate 15 million mu of land. What is even more coincidental is that the road traversed by the irrigation canal is exactly the road that the Yellow River water flooded in the past; it flows southeast along the Suoxu River and the Jialu River, and the central area irrigated happens to be the Yellow River flooded area. The Yellow River water is still the same Yellow River water, and the road traveled is still the same road, but, "The desolate autumn wind is here again, but the world has changed." It has to obey the command of the people in the Yellow River flooded area.

　　In this historically significant place, the buildings of the Dongfeng Canal head gate show an even more vigorous and proud posture. Not long ago, Comrade Guo Moruo came here to inspect. He stood on the tall head gate of the canal and stared at the Yellow River for a long time, writing a poem with these two lines:

　　Stretching a long gaze at the East Wind Gate,
　　The Yellow Dragon has been subdued to protect our China.

　　Yes, the Yellow Dragon has surrendered to the people, and Huayuankou will become a veritable large garden!

　　花园口变花园
　　柳笛
    所有黄泛区的老乡，一提起花园口，就像提起一场恶梦。听到花园口这个名字，浮在人们眼前的，是一片汪洋，是像千万头野兽般的滚滚黄水；是天昏地暗、鬼哭人嚎；是家破人亡，到处流浪；是饥饿，是寒冷，是死亡。
    二十年了啊！
    1938年6月，中州平原上麦子正熟，眼看着一场麦收就要到手，惨痛的灾难降临了。日本鬼子打到开封，蒋介石消极抗战，为了掩护自己逃命，下毒手炸开了花园口黄河大堤。在这里，黄河猛然张开凶恶的大口，黄水向东南一泻千里，顿时吞噬了无数的田园村庄。豫皖苏大平原上四十四个县五万四千平方公里，成了一片汪洋；受灾人口有一千二百五十万，死亡八十九万人，原来的沃野变成了荒无人烟的“黄泛区”。这场骇人听闻的灾难还没有消除，到了1946年，蒋介石又下毒手在花园口堵口复堤，让黄河改归故道，放水淹没解放区。那时，沿解放区的黄河大堤多年失修，许多地方的堤堰已经坦平，河滩里长着庄稼，布满了村庄，如果黄水冲来，又是一场不可避免的灾难。当时黄河下游解放区的人民提出“反蒋治黄”的口号，一边和国民党进行武装斗争，一边抢修堤防，国民党在白天派飞机轰炸、扫射，晚上派遣特务破坏。那时，我们抢修都来不及，可是还要在大堤上挖防空洞，修筑工事。
    就这样，花园口在河南、山东和安徽、江苏北部人民的心目里，就是灾难的化身。
    然而，今天，如果你再到花园口去，已经看不见原来的面貌了。从郑州北郊的胡屯，走上高大的花园口黄河大堤，眼前立刻展现出一片宜人的景色。宽敞的堤面两沿，生长着一行一行密茂的杨柳、洋槐、柏树、梧桐，还夹杂着一些不知名的灌木丛和花草，俨然像是一条林荫大道。有人说，从这里坐上汽车顺着大堤向东走，可以一直到海边。堤坡上培植着厚厚的葛苔草，像是一条狭长的绿毯。沿堤河滩上还有一片一片的果树园，种植着苹果、梨、葡萄、桃杏等等，据说，这样果树园在花园口一带已经有二三十处。站在黄河大堤上极目远眺，堤内平原上的庄稼像一片绿色海洋，堤外滚滚的黄水从邙山口奔流而下，撑着白帆的船队来往运输。花园口渡口一番繁忙景象。向上游看去，十几公里以外的黄河大桥隐约可见，烟云中就像一道青色长虹。
    抚今思昔，人们不会忘掉二十年前那场灾难。就在这里，仍然可以看到那些残存的历史遗迹。二十一年前国民党扒口的那一段一千多公尺的河堤，今天修筑得格外雄伟坚固。在这段巍然矗立的大堤西头，一所破旧的小亭子显得那么局促难看。这是1947年国民党在花园口堵口合龙时修的所谓纪念亭。过去，亭子里有一块石碑，蒋介石大言不惭地在上面题字：“济国安澜”。可是，这四个字不是一个极大的谎言吗？解放以后当地的群众摘下了这块骗人的招牌。亭子后面，紧靠河堤有一个大水潭，是1938年黄河决口时冲刷成的，现在变成了京水人民公社的养鱼池，不久以后这里将要种植上荷花，修建水上公园。
    在花园口参观，你会被任何一种细小的景物勾引起无限的回忆和神往，最能引人深思的是黄河的水声。凶猛的黄水尽管带着嚎叫冲击着大堤，可是它还是被英雄的人民治服了。从国民党扒口的地方向西走不远，传来不断的水流声，这声音那么温驯。原来这里有两条引黄灌溉渠，最大的一条叫东风渠，是去年大跃进的产物。当地群众在短短几个月的时间内就完成了这项输水量在三百秒公方以上的灌溉工程。据说这条总干渠加上十二条干渠共长六百三十八公里，可以灌溉一千五百万亩土地。更巧的是，灌溉渠经过的道路正是昔日黄水泛滥时走过的道路；它沿着索须河和贾鲁河向豫东南流去，灌溉的中心地区恰巧就是黄泛区。黄水依然是那一股黄水，走的路程依然是那一段路程，可是，“萧瑟秋风今又是，换了人间。”它不得不听从黄泛区人民的使唤了。
    在这个有历史意义的地方，东风渠渠首闸的建筑物更加显出一幅矫健自豪的姿态。不久以前，郭沫若同志到这里来视察，他站在高大的渠首闸上向黄河凝视良久，写了一首诗，诗中有这么两句：
    东风闸上舒长望，
    已伏黄龙护我华。
    是的，黄龙向人民屈服了，花园口将要变成名副其实的大花园！
