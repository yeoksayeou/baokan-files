Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 19th: Transportation departments in Jiangsu Province are seizing the opportunity to vigorously carry out advance transportation. In the past month, the province has already transported more than 200,000 tons of materials in advance.

In order to transport more materials during the relatively light transportation tasks of the third quarter, transportation departments in various regions have universally used methods such as visiting door-to-door, holding meetings with cargo owners, and conducting in-depth investigations in producing areas to carry out publicity and organization work for advance transportation. For example, after the Longtan Railway Station learned through investigation that local people's communes had a large stock of stone, some of which was urgently needed in Shanghai, it immediately contacted the commune and shipped 10,000 tons to Shanghai in advance.

In order to adapt to the needs of advance transportation, the staff of transportation departments in various regions fully utilized existing transportation potential and strived to improve transportation efficiency. The Suzhou Special District Shipping Company's No. 405 freighter concentrated wooden barges together before sailing to facilitate cable towing, and allowed the wooden barges to use sails to assist navigation during the voyage, increasing the amount of cargo towed each time from more than 300 tons to more than 700 tons. Due to continuous improvement of production technology and business management, the average daily output of horsepower for this company's freighters has reached 497 ton-kilometers, an increase of 60% compared with the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 19th: The entire staff of the Jinan Railway Bureau is working closely with the consignment departments to actively carry out advance transportation work. After completing the advance transportation task of more than 200,000 tons of iron ore, coal, refractory materials, and building materials in July, they have recently found more than 2.3 million tons of goods that can be transported in advance in the third quarter.

In accordance with the spirit of the Ministry of Railways' instructions on organizing advance transportation, the Jinan Railway Bureau launched a surge of organization for advance transportation from the beginning of July. After receiving the instructions on organizing advance transportation, the Xuzhou Train Section immediately dispatched three people to form a cargo source investigation team, which set off overnight. The next day, they organized more than 13,000 tons of materials crossing the river, such as river sand and kyanite, which were originally planned to be transported in the fourth quarter, and transported them all in advance in July.

In the work of organizing advance transportation, units under the Jinan Railway Bureau have received support and assistance from Party and government leading departments at all levels. The Provincial Transportation Command has formed two working groups to go to areas with large freight volumes to help solve problems in short-distance transportation and handling work. Zibo region, which has always attached importance to transportation work, has proactively increased the transportation labor force and transportation tools at major stations, strongly supporting advance transportation work.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 19th: Railway transportation departments within Hebei Province are vigorously organizing advance transportation of coal. In early August, the staff of Tangshan and Guye stations, on the basis of completing the coal transportation plan for early August, had already transported more than 13,000 tons of coal in advance for the fourth quarter, which is equivalent to the amount transported in advance in July.

In carrying out advance transportation, the cooperative relationship between railways and coal mines has become closer. In the spirit of jointly being responsible to the country for transporting more coal, railway and mine workers have come up with many ways to improve transportation efficiency. In July, Guye Station transported more than 17,000 tons of coal in advance for the fourth quarter, and in early August, it exceeded the transportation plan by more than 9,000 tons.

    摸清货源　各方协作　多拉快运
    江苏等地抓紧提前运输
    据新华社南京19日电　江苏省各地交通运输部门抓紧时机，大力开展提前运输，一个多月来全省已经提前运输了二十多万吨物资。
    为了在运输任务较轻的第三季度多运一些物资，各地运输部门普遍运用登门拜访、召开货主会议、深入产地摸底等方式，进行了提前运输的宣传工作和组织工作。如龙潭火车站通过调查，了解到当地人民公社采石场积存有大量石料，其中有一部分是上海迫切需要的，就立即同公社联系，提前向上海发运了一万吨。
    各地交通运输部门职工为了适应提前运输的需要，充分发挥现有运输潜力，努力提高运输效率。苏州专区轮船运输公司四百零五号轮，在航前把木驳船集中在一起便于带缆，航行中让木驳船扯篷助航，使每次拖载量从三百多吨增加到七百多吨。这个公司由于不断改进生产技术和经营管理，目前货轮马力日产量平均达到四百九十七吨公里，比去年同期提高60％。
    据新华社济南19日电　济南铁路局全局职工同托运部门紧密合作，积极开展提前运输工作。在7月份完成铁矿石、煤炭、耐火材料和建筑器材等二十多万吨的提前运输任务以后，最近又找到可以提前在第三季度运输的货源二百三十多万吨。
    济南铁路局根据铁道部组织提前运输指示的精神，从7月初起就掀起了一个组织提前运输的热潮。徐州车务一段接到组织提前运输的指示后，当天就调出三人，组成货源调查小组，连夜出发，第二天就组织了原计划在第四季度运输的河沙、焦宝石等一万三千多吨过江物资，全部提前在7月运出。
    济南铁路局所属单位在组织提前运输工作中，得到各级党政领导部门的支持和帮助。省交通运输指挥部已组成两个工作组到货运量较大的地区，帮助解决短途运输和搬运装卸工作中的问题。一向重视交通运输工作的淄博地区，主动地增加了各重要车站的运输劳动力和运输工具，有力地支持了提前运输工作。
    据新华社天津19日电　河北省境内铁路运输部门正在大力组织煤炭提前运输工作。8月上旬，唐山、古冶两站职工在完成上旬煤炭运输计划的基础上，已为第四季度提前运输煤炭一万三千多吨，等于7月份一个月提前运输的运量。
    在开展提前运输中，铁路同煤矿协作关系愈加密切，路矿职工本着共同为国家负责多运煤炭的精神，想出许多办法，提高运输效率。7月份古冶站提前运出第四季度煤炭一万七千多吨，8月上旬又超额九千多吨完成运输计划。
