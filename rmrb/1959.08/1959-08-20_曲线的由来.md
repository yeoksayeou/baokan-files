　　The Origin of the Curve
　　Wu Lü
    There is an uneven curve on the construction progress chart of the ingot casting workshop of the Beijing Steel Plant. Initially, the main structural work was completed in only thirty-six working days, and the progress was very fast. After that, it was only the finishing work, and it should have been a "complete success" in theory, but the construction period was delayed again and again, and it took twice the time of the main structural work to complete. Recently, after checking the slack mood, the progress of the project has improved again, and the planned completion date has been brought forward by twenty days.
    How was this curve, from fast to slow, and then from slow to fast, formed? Could it be that objective conditions have changed? No. If we must say that objective conditions have changed, then this change can only be beneficial to speeding up the progress of the project. Everyone knows that although the finishing work has some special problems, such as the project being relatively fragmented, it cannot be ignored at all; but after all, it is the finishing work, and the workload and technical requirements are much less than the main structural work, and it is also relatively simple. In theory, from the main structural work to the finishing work, the construction progress should only be faster, not slower. So, why did the construction project of the ingot casting workshop of the Beijing Steel Plant have the completely opposite situation? Here, the most fundamental reason is the change in subjective conditions.
    Please see: When doing the main structural work, there was full enthusiasm, so despite the large workload and strict technical requirements, the progress was still very fast; when it came to the finishing work, a few leading cadres thought that "the main structure is finished, we can take it slow," and relaxed, so despite the smaller workload and simpler technical requirements, the progress was slow; once the slack mood was checked and enthusiasm was boosted again, the progress accelerated again. Here, isn't it the subjective factors of people that are controlling the construction progress?
    When we do anything, we must consider the objective conditions. Under the current condition of not much scrap steel in our country, steel is mainly made with iron, and steel cannot be made without the objective condition of iron. However, even with iron, if no one refines it, iron will not become steel. However, to refine iron into steel, there must be both the objective condition of iron and the subjective condition of people. The two are indispensable. Comrade Mao Zedong said in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "The result of the struggle between the contradictory opposing sides is invariably their transformation into each other on certain conditions. Here, conditions are important. Without certain conditions, the struggling sides will not transform themselves." It is wrong to deny that the contradictory opposing sides can only transform themselves under certain conditions and engage in wishful thinking; it is equally wrong to only see the role of objective conditions and ignore the role of subjective conditions, and relax subjective efforts.
    Now some comrades, when doing work, often only consider what the objective conditions are, while ignoring another condition—how much subjective effort is made. Little do they know that the degree of subjective effort often determines the degree of how well the work is done. If there is insufficient subjective effort, even if the objective conditions are good, the work may not be done well; if the objective conditions are relatively poor, but the subjective effort is particularly great, the work can be done well. This is the enlightenment and lesson that the construction progress curve of the ingot casting workshop of the Beijing Steel Plant provides us.
    The slow progress of finishing works in capital construction is a relatively common phenomenon. After examining the reasons, I am afraid that it has something to do with the slack mood to varying degrees. It seems that to speed up the progress of the finishing works and allow the newly built factories to be put into production as soon as possible, the first thing to do is to solve the problem of subjective effort.

　　曲线的由来
　　吴滤
    北京钢厂铸锭车间的施工进度表上有一条起伏不平的曲线。开始，主体结构工程只用了三十六个工作日就完成了，进度很快。这以后只是收尾工程了，按照道理说，应当是“马到成功”了，可是工期却一拖再拖，竟要用两倍于主体结构工程的时间才能竣工。最近，经过检查松劲情绪，工程进度才又有了起色，计划竣工的日期提前了二十天。
    这条由快到慢，又由慢到快的曲线是怎样形成的呢？莫非客观条件发生了变化吗？不是的。如果一定要说客观条件发生了变化，那么这种变化也只会有利于加快工程的进度。谁都知道，收尾工程虽然有些特殊的问题，如工程比较零碎等等，丝毫不容忽视；但是它毕竟是收尾工程，工作量、技术要求都比主体工程要少得多，也比较简单些。按理说，由主体工程转入收尾工程，施工进度只会快些，不会慢些。那么，为什么北京钢厂铸锭车间的建设工程反而出现了完全相反的情况呢？这里，最根本的原因还是主观条件的变化。
    请看：干主体工程的时候，干劲十足，于是，尽管工作量很大，技术要求很严格，仍然进度很快；到了收尾工程的时候，少数领导干部以为“主体结构已经完了，可以慢慢来了”，松了劲，于是，尽管工作量小了，技术要求也比较简单了，反而进度迟缓；一旦检查了松劲情绪，重新鼓足干劲，进度又加快了。这里，左右施工进度的，不正是人的主观因素吗？
    我们做任何事情，都要考虑客观条件。在我国目前废钢不多的条件下，炼钢主要用铁，没有铁这个客观条件就炼不出钢来。但是，有了铁，没有人去炼，铁也不会变成钢。可是，炼铁成钢，既要有铁这个客观条件，也要有人这个主观条件。两者缺一不可。毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演中说：“矛盾着的对立的双方互相斗争的结果，无不在一定条件下互相转化。在这里，条件是重要的。没有一定的条件，斗争着的双方都不会转化。”否认矛盾着的对立的双方，只有在一定的条件下才能互相转化，想入非非，是错误的；只看到客观条件的作用，忽视主观条件的作用，放松主观上的努力，同样是错误的。
    现在有些同志做工作的时候，往往只考虑客观条件如何，而忽略另一个条件——主观努力如何。殊不知主观努力的程度往往是决定工作好坏的程度的。主观上努力不够，客观条件再好，也未必能把工作做好；客观条件比较差一些，但主观上格外努力，却能把工作做好。这就是北京钢厂铸锭车间施工进度的曲线，给我们提供的一个启发和教训。
    基本建设中收尾工程步履迟迟，是一个比较普遍的现象，检查原因，恐怕或多或少都同松劲情绪有些关系。看来，要加快收尾工程的进度，让新建的工厂尽快地投入生产，首先还是要解决主观努力这个条件问题。
