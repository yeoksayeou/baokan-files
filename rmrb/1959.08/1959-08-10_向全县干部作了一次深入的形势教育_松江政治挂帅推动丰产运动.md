Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 8th. After "thinking deeply," cadres at all levels in Songjiang County, Shanghai, recognized the favorable situation in the countryside and, filled with fighting spirit, actively led production at the forefront. A new high tide has emerged in the county's movement for bumper harvests of rice, exceeding plans and contracted yields, within a short period.

Over the past month, the Songjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has conducted thorough education on the rural situation for all county cadres, combining summaries of past work with deployments for future work. The County Committee convened a three-level cadre meeting, and communes and production teams also held successive cadre meetings to extensively discuss the situation and the overall picture. According to the analysis of these meetings, the current countryside is on the eve of an even greater leap forward in production, with very favorable conditions. Songjiang County achieved a large increase in summer crops this year, with wheat, barley, naked barley, and rapeseed yields increasing by more than 40% compared to last year. Early rice was a bumper harvest, and the growth of mid-season and late-season rice is also unprecedentedly good. In addition, with the implementation of the Party's various policies in commune construction, the masses' morale is even fuller, and their production enthusiasm is particularly high. Some commune members sought out cadres to request increasing production tasks; some automatically requested raising labor quotas; some significantly increased the fertilizer accumulation targets set by cadres; and young people eagerly requested to be assigned the most arduous tasks. Therefore, these meetings reached a unanimous conclusion: the key to striving for a greater leap forward in agricultural production this year lies in seizing favorable opportunities and actively strengthening leadership.

In the discussion, the cadres of this county carried out criticism and self-criticism in the spirit of rectification. They examined that the main manifestations of some cadres' thinking lagging behind the current rural situation are: seeing more difficulties and fewer favorable conditions; and formulating production targets with a tendency to be too low, with some targets achievable without arduous effort. The masses have already expressed dissatisfaction with this mood of these cadres. They asked the cadres: Why don't you lead us to work hard? One production team formulated a contracted yield plan of 500 jin per mu for rice, and when submitted to the masses for discussion, they dissatisfiedly called it a "yield reduction target." Cadres at all levels also analyzed the reasons for the existence of the above-mentioned ideological mood, believing that in addition to being busy all day long, not being good at taking a broad view of the overall situation, assessing the situation, and lacking sensitivity to new things, one of the main reasons is a one-sided understanding of the relationship between revolutionary vigor and scientific analysis, and not understanding that under the conditions of objective possibility, subjective initiative has an extremely promoting effect and can determine the success or failure of a matter. They cited typical examples at each meeting to illustrate the importance of giving full play to subjective initiative. 70% of the farmland in the Xinwu Commune is low-lying, where only one crop of rice can be planted in previous years, and the winter is a vast expanse of water, where no crops are planted. The cadres of this commune led the masses to fight for four months, dredging rivers, digging ditches, and draining waterlogging, turning low-lying land into fertile fields. However, due to the low water level, the soil was too wet after the rice harvest, and summer crops could not be planted in time. They boldly adopted advanced measures of seedling cultivation and transplantation and planted wheat before the season. This commune had a bumper wheat harvest this year, and its yield per unit area became the champion of the county. The cultivated land in Shanyang Commune is fertile and has always been a high-yield area for wheat. The cadres of this commune once relaxed their leadership, the wheat sowing was delayed, and the subsequent field management was also relatively lax. This year, the average wheat yield per mu was only 214 jin, and it was reduced to a low-yield area in the county.

After "thinking deeply," the cadres of this county were greatly encouraged. They and the masses re-examined the rice yield targets and found that there are many favorable conditions for increasing rice production this year: last year, various production teams had bumper rice harvests, accumulating extremely rich field management experience; this year, the county's more than 400,000 mu of green manure achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest with a doubled yield; and the chemical fertilizers and other production materials supported by the city have also increased several times. Therefore, with effort, it is entirely possible to exceed the plan and the contracted yield for rice production. Communes successively proposed new targets and added many bumper harvest measures, and a vigorous movement for exceeding the plan and the contracted yield of rice production was launched throughout the county. The responsible cadres of the County Committee went deep into the communes, and 70% of the cadres of the county-level organs went to the countryside separately. The commune cadres carried their luggage to the production teams. Cadres at all levels participated in labor while guiding production, giving great encouragement to the masses. Under the leadership of the cadres, old peasants, young people, and women also competed to engage in high-yield fields. Some communes reorganized the rice seedling growth situation with the requirements of exceeding production. Some of the original second-class or even first-class seedlings have now been downgraded to third-class, requiring further improvement. In the near future, communes and teams throughout the county have organized shock brigades to carry out intensive cultivation, topdressing, and pest control, and launched a comprehensive attack on third-class seedlings. For more than half a month, the area of third-class seedlings decreased from 20% of the total area to 6%.

### 向全县干部作了一次深入的形势教育  松江政治挂帅推动丰产运动

    向全县干部作了一次深入的形势教育
    松江政治挂帅推动丰产运动
    新华社上海8日电　上海市松江县各级干部经过“务虚”，认清当前农村的有利形势后，斗志昂扬，积极站在群众前面领导生产，全县水稻超计划、超包产的丰产运动短时期内出现新的高潮。
    中共松江县委近一个月来，结合总结过去工作和部署今后工作，向全县干部作了一次深入的农村形势教育。县委召开了三级干部会议，公社和生产队也接连召开干部会议，大讲形势，畅谈大局。根据这些会议的分析，当前农村正处于生产更大跃进的前夕，条件十分有利。松江县今年夏熟作物大增产，小麦、大麦、元麦和油菜的产量比去年增加四成以上，早稻丰收，中晚稻生长也空前良好。加上在公社建设方面贯彻执行了党的各项政策，群众情绪更加饱满，生产干劲特别高昂。有的社员找干部，要求增加生产任务；有的自动要求提高劳动定额；有的把干部订的积肥指标，大大加码；青年人纷纷要求分配最艰苦的工作。因此这些会议得出一致结论，就是争取今年农业生产更大跃进的关键在于抓住有利时机，积极加强领导。
    这个县的干部在讨论中以整风精神开展了批评与自我批评。他们检查出一部分干部的思想落后于当前农村形势的主要表现是：遇事看困难多，看有利条件少；制订生产指标有偏低倾向，有些指标，不需要经过艰苦努力就能实现。这些干部的这种情绪，群众已经表示不满意。他们问干部：为什么不领导我们大干？有一个生产队制订水稻亩产五百斤的包产方案，交给群众讨论时，群众不满地称它为“减产指标”。各级干部还对上述思想情绪存在的原因作了分析，认为除了终日忙忙碌碌，不善于纵览全局，审度形势，缺乏对新鲜事物的敏感外，主要原因之一是片面理解革命干劲和科学分析之间的关系，不懂得在客观可能性具备的条件下，主观能动性有极大的促进作用，可以决定一件事情的成功或者失败。他们在各次会议上列举典型事例，说明充分发挥主观能动性的重要意义。新五公社70％的农田是低洼地，历年只能种一熟水稻，冬季一片汪洋，不种庄稼。这个公社的干部带领群众奋战四个月，挖深河道开沟排涝，变洼地为良田。但由于水位低，水稻收割后泥土过湿，不能及时种上夏熟作物。他们便大胆地采用了育苗移植的先进措施，赶在季节前种上小麦。这个公社今年小麦大丰收，单位面积产量成为全县之冠。山阳公社耕地肥沃，历来是小麦高产区。这个公社干部一度放松领导，小麦播种误过农时，以后的田间管理也较松懈，今年小麦平均亩产只有二百十四斤，降成全县的低产区。
    这个县的干部经过“务虚”，精神大振，他们和群众一起重新审查了水稻的产量指标，发现今年水稻增产有很多有利条件：去年各个生产队水稻大丰收，积累了极丰富的田间管理经验；今年全县四十多万亩绿肥以翻一番的产量获得空前丰收；城市支援的化肥及其他生产资料又成倍增加。因此，经过努力，水稻产量超过计划、超过包产是完全有可能实现的。各公社纷纷提出了新的指标，增加了许多丰产措施，全县范围内掀起了轰轰烈烈的水稻超计划、超包产运动。县委负责干部深入公社，县级机关的70％的干部分头下乡，公社干部背行李到了生产队。各级干部边参加劳动，边指导生产，给群众以极大的鼓舞。在干部的带领下，老农、青年、妇女也争搞丰产田。有的公社以超产的要求，对稻苗生长情况重新排队，有些原来的二类甚至一类苗现已被降为三类，要求进一步提高。全县社社队队近一时期都组织突击大军，中耕、追肥、治虫，向三类苗全面猛攻，为时半月多，三类苗由占总面积的20％下降到6％。
