Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th. The Second All-Union Games of the Peoples of the Soviet Union successfully concluded on the 16th. That afternoon, about 100,000 people participated in the grand closing ceremony held at the Lenin Central Stadium. At the closing ceremony, the winning teams and individuals of this Games were awarded prizes.

The chief referee of this Games, Valuev, announced the results of the team and individual competitions. Among the seventeen participating teams, the first place was the Moscow team, the second place was the Russian Federation combined team, the third place was the Leningrad team, the fourth place was the Ukrainian team, and the fifth place was the Georgian team. They all received trophies and certificates awarded by the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. The winners of the individual competitions and the champion teams in individual events were also awarded the title of Champion of the Second All-Union Games of the Peoples of the Soviet Union and Champion of the Soviet Union in 1959. In this Games, the sports organizations that won the top two places, the Soviet Armed Forces team, and the Leningrad Dynamo team also received trophies from the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and the Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol.

Romanov, Chairman of the Central Council of the Union of Soviet Societies for Sports and Physical Culture, spoke at the closing ceremony. He said that this Games demonstrated the excellent level of Soviet sports and made a contribution to the further development of Soviet sports.

Kuznetsov, a Meritorious Master of Sports of the Soviet Union, read a letter of salute from the Congress to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at the closing ceremony.

This Games officially opened on the 8th of this month. It was the largest Games held in the Soviet Union in recent years.

The technical level of Soviet athletes has been further improved. So far, the Soviet Union holds thirteen of the thirty-six world records in track and field; sixteen of the twenty-eight world records in weightlifting; and twelve of the thirteen world records in speed skating.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th. Commentary by our reporter: The unprecedented and grand Second All-Union Games of the Peoples of the Soviet Union successfully concluded here on the 16th.

During the days of the Games, people watched with attention and excitement the tremendous development of Soviet sports activities under the care of the Soviet Communist Party and the government. In these few short days, Soviet athletes broke two world records three times (the light heavyweight jerk twice broke the world record set by American Jan George in 1956), set twelve all-Soviet records, one hundred and fifty-four Union Republic records, and one hundred and fifty-one sports association records.

In this Games, Soviet athletes achieved quite good results in track and field. This reflects the tremendous development of Soviet track and field in recent years.

Race walker Vedyakov broke the world record in the 50-kilometer race walk (one hour, twenty-seven minutes, and fifty-three and four tenths seconds) at this Games. Thus, Soviet athletes have broken five world records in track and field so far this year, while track and field athletes from other countries have broken only three world records in total this year. The United States, which has maintained its advantage in track and field for many years, has only set one world record in the men's javelin throw this year (Cantelo, with a score of 86.04 meters).

The most difficult event in track and field is the decathlon. The achievements of the famous Soviet decathlete Kuznetsov this year have attracted the attention of the world sports community. His score at this Games reached 8005 points, which is the fifth time he has exceeded the 8000-point mark.

Soviet track and field athletes also set many excellent results this year at this Games. For example, Itkina's time in the women's 400-meter race was 53.7 seconds, only 0.1 second behind the world record. I. Press set the best score of the year in the women's pentathlon - 4,766 points. Bolotnikov's 10,000-meter race time was 29 minutes and 3 seconds. Popov's marathon race time was 2 hours, 21 minutes, and 54.2 seconds.

In the triple jump, four people jumped over the 16-meter mark. The champion was Fedoseyev, who set a world record (16.70 meters) in May this year, with a score of 16.54 meters. In the past, the triple jump had long been dominated by Japanese and Brazilian athletes, but now Soviet athletes account for the vast majority of the world's best triple jumpers.

It should be pointed out that track and field is the foundation of sports. In the three years since 1956, the strength of Soviet track and field has jumped to the first place in the world. In 1958, the Soviet Union defeated the American track and field team, which once dominated the world, for the first time with a score of 172 to 170; this year, it defeated the American team again by a margin of eight points (175 to 167).

Like many sports competitions held in the Soviet Union in the past, a clear feature of this Games is that new blood is growing particularly rapidly. For example, the young Farajan defeated the world champion Bushuev in lightweight weightlifting, which is the second time this year. Last year, the world epee champion Lilschi and the World Championship runner-up Tischler were both defeated by novices. The world pistol shooting record holder Umarov was defeated by the unknown Volinsky with an excellent score of 598 rings in the competition. Two-time European heavyweight boxing champion Abramov was defeated by Konoplev of Leningrad.

The results of this Games show that Soviet athletes are striding forward in an encouraging direction - catching up with the world level in all events.

The ranks of Soviet weightlifters, who already occupy the first place in the world, are growing stronger. The number and results of athletes at all levels have also increased and improved universally in the past three years. Only 196 athletes participated in the weightlifting competitions at all levels in the first Games, while this Games increased to 250. Soviet athletes are rapidly improving their performance in the clean and jerk, which was originally a weaker event. For example, Farajan's clean and jerk score when he won the championship was 155 kg. Plyukfelder's clean and jerk score in the light heavyweight class reached 176.5 kg. Begov in the same class jerked 177 kg, only half a kilogram behind the world record of Chinese athlete Zhao Qingkui.

Swimming was originally a weaker event in the Soviet Union. At the 16th Olympic Games in 1956, Soviet athletes only won two bronze medals. At last year's European Swimming Championships, the Soviet Union had already won five championships, ranking first in the competition. Since the beginning of this year, Soviet swimmers have achieved even better results, especially male athletes, who have made rapid progress in all events and set three all-Soviet records at this Games.

Soviet athletes are advancing towards the peak of sports with tenacious will. At present, they have maintained world championships in fifteen sports, including weightlifting, gymnastics, modern pentathlon, fencing, freestyle wrestling, shooting, and chess. People can expect that with the passage of time, new sports achievements will continue to be spread from the Soviet sports army. (Attached picture)

　　体育水平日益提高　新生力量不断涌现
　　第二届全苏运动会胜利闭幕
    据新华社莫斯科17日电　第二届苏联各民族运动大会16日胜利闭幕。这天下午，约十万人参加了在列宁中央运动场举行的盛大的闭幕式。在闭幕式上，这次运动会的获胜的队和个人都得了奖。
    这届运动会的总裁判长瓦卢耶夫宣布了运动会的团体和个人比赛结果。在参加比赛的十七个代表队中，第一名是莫斯科队，第二名是俄罗斯联邦混合队，第三名是列宁格勒队，第四名是乌克兰队，第五名是格鲁吉亚队。它们都获得了苏联部长会议颁发的奖杯和奖状。个人比赛的优胜者和单项比赛中获得冠军的各个代表队也都分别被授予第二届苏联各民族运动大会冠军和1959年苏联冠军的称号。在这届运动会中，获得前二名的体育组织，苏联武装力量代表队和列宁格勒的狄纳莫队也得到了全苏工会中央理事会和苏联共青团中央委员会的奖杯。
    苏联体育协会和体育组织联合会中央理事会主席罗曼诺夫在闭幕式上讲了话。他说，这届运动会显示了苏联优良的体育水平，它对进一步发展苏联体育运动作出了贡献。
    苏联功勋运动健将库兹涅佐夫在闭幕式上宣读了大会致苏联共产党中央委员会的致敬信。
    这届运动会是从本月8日正式开幕的。这是苏联近年来规模最大的一次运动会。
    苏联运动员的技术水平有了进一步的提高。到目前为止，田径运动中的三十六项世界纪录，苏联就占有十三项；二十八项世界举重纪录中，苏联占有十六项；而十三项滑冰比赛世界纪录中，有十二项属于苏联。
    据新华社莫斯科17日电　本社记者评述：规模空前、声势浩大的第二届苏联各民族运动大会16日在这里胜利闭幕了。
    在运动会举行的日子里，人们以关注和兴奋的心情注视着苏联体育活动在苏联共产党和政府关怀下所获得的巨大发展。在这短短的几天中，苏联运动员一共三次打破了两项世界纪录（其中轻重量级挺举两次打破了美国人詹·乔治1956年创造的世界纪录），创造了十二项全苏纪录、一百五十四个加盟共和国纪录和一百五十一个体育协会的纪录。
    在这次运动会中，苏联运动员在田径赛中取得了相当好的成绩。这反映了苏联田径运动在近几年的巨大发展。
    竞走运动员维佳科夫在这次运动会上打破了五十公里竞走的世界纪录（一小时二十七分五十三点四秒）。这样，苏联运动员今年以来在田径运动中已经打破了五项世界纪录，而今年以来其他国家的田径运动员一共才打破三项世界纪录。在田径运动中保持多年优势的美国，今年只创造了男子标枪一项世界纪录（坎特洛，成绩八十六点零四米）。
    田径运动中最难的一项是十项运动。苏联著名十项运动员库兹涅佐夫今年所表现的成就引起了世界体育界的重视。他在这次运动会上的成绩达到八千零五分，这已经是他第五次超过八千分大关了。
    这次运动会上苏联田径运动员还创造了许多今年以来的优秀成绩。例如，伊特金娜在女子四百米赛跑中成绩为五十三点七秒，比世界纪录只差零点一秒。伊·普雷斯创造了女子五项运动今年以来最好的成绩——四千七百六十六分。鲍洛特尼科夫的一万米赛跑成绩为二十九分三秒。波波夫马拉松赛跑——二小时二十一分五十四点二秒。
    在三级跳远中，有四人跳过了十六米大关。冠军为今年5月刚创造世界纪录（十六点七○米）的费多谢耶夫所获得，成绩是十六点五四米。三级跳远过去曾经长期为日本和巴西选手保持着优势，现在世界上最优秀的三级跳远选手中，苏联运动员就占了绝大多数。
    应当指出，田径运动是体育运动的基础，在1956年以来的三年中，苏联的田径实力已跃居为世界第一位，1958年，苏联以一百七十二分对一百七十分第一次击败了曾一度称霸全球的美国田径队；今年又以八分之先（一百七十五比一百六十七）再一次击败了美国队。
    同历来苏联举行的许多体育比赛一样，这次运动大会的一个鲜明特点是，新的血液成长得特别迅速。例如年轻的法拉江在轻量级举重中击败了世界冠军布舒耶夫，这已经是今年以来的第二次了。去年，世界重剑冠军里尔斯基和世界锦标赛亚军蒂什勒都被新手所击败。世界手枪射击纪录保持者乌马罗夫在比赛中被不知名的沃林斯基以五百九十八环的优异成绩打败。两次欧洲重量级拳击冠军阿布拉莫夫为列宁格勒的科诺普列夫所击败。
    这次运动大会的成绩表明，苏联运动员正在朝着一个令人振奋的方向阔步前进——在一切项目上赶上世界水平。
    已经占世界第一位的苏联举重运动员的队伍越来越壮大。三年来各级运动员的数目和成绩也都有普遍的增加和提高。参加第一届运动会的各级举重比赛的只有一百九十六名选手，而这一届却增加到了二百五十名。苏联运动员在原来比较弱的挺举中，成绩正在迅速上升。例如，轻量级的法拉江在获冠军时的挺举成绩为一百五十五公斤。轻重量级的普留克费尔德尔的挺举成绩达到一百七十六点五公斤。同一级的别哥夫挺起了一百七十七公斤，比中国选手赵庆奎的世界纪录只差半公斤。
    游泳原来是苏联较弱的一个项目，在1956年第十六届奥运会时，苏联的运动员只取得二个铜质奖章。去年欧洲游泳锦标赛时，苏联已经取得五个冠军，占比赛的第一位。今年以来苏联游泳健儿们的成绩更好，特别是男子运动员，他们在所有项目中都进展得很迅速，在这次运动会上创造了三项全苏纪录。
    苏联运动员正在以顽强的意志向体育的顶峰前进。目前他们已经保持着举重、体操、现代五项、击剑、自由式摔跤、射击、象棋等十五个体育项目的世界冠军。人们可以期望，随着时间的推移，体育运动的新成绩将不断从苏联的体育大军中传出来。（附图片）
