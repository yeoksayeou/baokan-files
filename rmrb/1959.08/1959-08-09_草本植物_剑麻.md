    Herbaceous Plant - Sisal
    Sisal is a tropical herbaceous plant. It has a short stem, and its leaves are fleshy, lanceolate, and about eight to fifteen centimeters thick. Leaves can be harvested three to four years after planting, with an annual yield of about 200 jin of fiber per mu.
    Sisal fiber, due to its high elasticity, strong tensile strength, and wear resistance, is an important raw material for manufacturing ropes, cables, transmission belts, and tarpaulins for maritime and industrial and mining uses. Degummed fiber can also be used to weave burlap sacks, and when mixed with silk, it can be used to weave various fabrics. It can also be used to weave hats, handbags, slippers, harnesses, etc. In addition, the leaf pulp can be used to extract alcohol, and the fiber fragments from the leaf pulp can be used to make high-quality paper and rayon. Last year, Chen Zhennan, a worker at the Honghua State Farm on Hainan Island, also successfully experimented with extracting "Hecogenin" from the leaf pulp juice, which is the basic raw material for manufacturing "Cortisone," a special medicine for treating rheumatism and paralysis.
    This year, Hainan Island plans to plant more than 30,000 mu of sisal throughout the island.

    草本植物——剑麻
    剑麻是一种热带草本植物。茎短，叶片是肉质、坡针形，厚约八至十五厘米。种后三、四年开始刈叶，每亩一年可收纤维约二百斤。
    剑麻纤维，由于弹性大，拉力强，又耐磨擦，所以它是制造航海和工矿用的绳缆、网索、传动胶袋和防水布等的重要原料；脱胶后的纤维还可以用来织制麻布袋，与丝混合可织各种布料，还可编织帽子，手提袋、便鞋、马具等，此外，叶粕可提炼酒精、叶粕的纤维碎屑可制上等纸张，人造丝。去年海南岛国营红华农场工人陈镇南还试验成功从叶粕汁液中提炼出“海柯吉宁”，这是制造医治风湿、麻痹症的特效药“柯帝霜”的基本原料。
    海南岛的剑麻，今年全岛计划种植三万多亩。
