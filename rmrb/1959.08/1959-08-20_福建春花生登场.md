Xinhua News Agency report: Fujian Province's spring peanuts are generally mature and entering the harvest season. Currently, the province has harvested more than 550,000 mu of peanuts, accounting for more than 45% of the sown area. Good news of large-scale harvests are coming from various places. The Xiashan Brigade in Xianyou County has harvested 149 mu of peanuts, with an average yield per mu increasing by 68% compared to last year. The Liu Yi Brigade has harvested 144 mu of peanuts, with an average yield per mu increasing by 59% compared to last year.

In order to promptly harvest the matured peanuts, many areas are harvesting during the day and picking pods at night, and have launched a high work efficiency campaign. The Huangtang Brigade of the Donghong Commune in Hui'an County adopted a method of one ox, one plow, one person holding the plow, and four people following behind to pull vines and pick pods, which increased work efficiency by 50% compared to simply pulling by hand. In just half a day, they harvested all 220 mu of peanuts.

All localities are paying attention to improving quality during the harvest. The Che'ao Brigade of the Wujiang Commune in Zhangpu County organized 35 specialized teams for careful picking and harvesting, separately pulling, picking, selecting, and carrying, and inspecting each other, weighing and accepting each plot to ensure that every kernel returns home. Some production teams have also implemented a production responsibility system of "assigning plots to groups, and scoring based on output," which has greatly motivated the commune members to harvest quickly and well. Many brigades in Hui'an County have also established peanut inspectors during the fine harvest campaign, assigning responsibility for each plot, inspecting each plot after harvesting, and immediately organizing the masses to re-dig and pick up any unharvested peanuts. To encourage commune members to pick and harvest carefully, many places have implemented reasonable reward systems, praising good people and deeds at any time, and establishing "pace-setters" for meticulous harvesting and picking.

　　福建春花生登场
    据新华社讯　福建省春花生普遍成熟，进入收获季节。目前，全省已收花生五十五万多亩，占播种面积的45％以上。各地陆续传来大面积丰收的消息。仙游县霞山大队已收的一百四十九亩花生，平均亩产比去年增加68％；六一大队已收的一百四十四亩花生，每亩平均比去年增加59％。
    为了把成熟了的花生能及时收回，许多地区都是白天收获，晚上摘荚，并且开展了高工效运动。惠安县东红公社黄塘大队采取一牛一犁一人扶犁、四人跟在后面拉藤拾荚的办法，比单纯用人工拔提高工效50％，仅半天时间就把二百二十亩花生全部收回来了。
    各地在收获中都注意提高质量。漳浦县浯江公社车鳌大队组织了三十五个精摘细收专业队，分别拔、摘、拣、挑，并互相检查，逐丘过秤验收，保证了颗粒还家。有的生产队还贯彻“定丘到组，以产评分”的生产责任制度，社员干劲很足，收得又快又好。惠安县不少大队在开展细收运动中，还设立花生验收员，分片负责收一丘、验一丘，发现没有收净的地方，立即组织群众重新挖拾。为鼓励社员精摘细收，许多地方都贯彻了合理的奖励制度，随时表扬好人好事，树立精收细摘的“标兵”。
