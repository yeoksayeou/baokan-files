Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 10th August: All steel rolling mills under the Anshan Iron and Steel Company completed the steel production plan for the first ten days of August sixteen hours ahead of schedule, with an excess output of 1,800 tons of steel. After setting a record for the highest output in July, the workers of these steel rolling mills jointly issued a proposal to fraternal steel rolling mills across the country on August 4 to increase steel production by 100,000 tons. In recent days, workers in various steel rolling mills have held meetings to discuss and study measures to realize the proposal, and have launched in-depth competitions to increase the production of high-quality steel. The Party committees of various steel rolling mills have also promptly summarized the experience of July, continued to mobilize workers to exert their energy, tap potential, and strive for a flying start in August. Many leading cadres of steel rolling mills have taken the lead in going deep into the front lines to guide workers in launching production increase competitions. The Party committees of some steel rolling mills have also promptly reversed the complacent and relaxed mood of a few cadres due to overfulfilling the plan in July, so production has gradually increased in recent days. Steel production on August 6 increased by 714 tons compared to the 5th, and on the 7th it increased by 1,387 tons compared to the 6th. On the 9th, it increased by 3,180 tons compared to the 7th.

　　After the workers of the First Medium Plate Mill completed the plan for the first ten days of August ahead of schedule, the Party committee immediately held a meeting to revise the production increase conditions based on the new situation, changing the original plan to increase steel plate production by 3,000 tons in two months to achieving it within one month. When the workers of the small steel rolling mill heard that the First Medium Plate Mill's two-month production increase target was to be completed in one month, the Party committee also immediately held a meeting, calling on all workers to muster greater revolutionary energy, strive to complete the plan to increase steel production by 4,000 tons in two months within August, and then increase production by another 4,000 tons of high-quality steel for the country in September to present a gift to the tenth anniversary of National Day.
　　Now, the workers of various steel rolling mills are in high spirits, advancing victoriously, and striving to realize the proposed condition of increasing steel production by 100,000 tons before National Day.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th August: The workers of the Liulihe Cement Plant, who have overfulfilled their production plans for seven consecutive months, fought against continuous rainy days, completed the production plan for the first ten days of August ahead of schedule, and produced more than 1,000 tons of cement for the country. The average daily output in this ten-day period increased by 109 tons compared to the first ten days of July and by 70 tons compared to the last ten days, with all quality up to standard.
　　At the beginning of the month, the Party committee of this factory mobilized all the workers to advance victoriously and set off a new production upsurge. In the continuous rainy days, the quarry workers who were mining in the open air braved the rain to quarry stone from the mountains dozens of meters high. In the first five days of August, the quarrying task was overfulfilled every day. On the 6th, it rained heavily all day, and in order to prepare for production on the 7th, the quarry workers mined more than 400 tons of limestone on that day. Due to the sufficient supply of raw materials, the entire factory overproduced 248 tons of cement on the second day, completing the daily plan. The mill operators implemented the measure of increasing the speed of the noodle rolling machine on the cement mill, increasing the speed of the noodle rolling machine, so that the hourly output increased from 68 tons to 72 tons, creating the factory's highest cement production record this year. On August 8, the workers further increased the average hourly output to 73.6 tons. The workers in the calcination workshop launched a kiln-to-kiln competition on the cement kilns and adhered to the post-shift evaluation system. The second team of fire watchers also launched a 100-day safe operation competition. This team has high product quality and good safety. As of today, it has been operating safely for 135 days.

　　提前十六个小时　超产一千八百吨
　　鞍钢出色完成上旬钢材计划
　　琉璃河水泥厂战胜连雨天，十天超产好水泥一千多吨
    新华社鞍山10日电　鞍山钢铁公司所属各个轧钢厂，提前十六小时超额一千八百吨钢材，完成了8月上旬钢材产量计划。这些轧钢厂的职工，在7月份创造了最高产量纪录以后，曾在8月4日联合向全国各兄弟轧钢厂发出增产十万吨钢材的倡议。近几天来，各轧钢厂职工纷纷开会讨论研究实现倡议措施，并且深入展开竞赛，增产优质钢材。各轧钢厂的党委也及时总结了7月份的经验，继续发动职工鼓足干劲，挖掘潜力，争取8月份生产开门红。不少轧钢厂的领导干部纷纷带头深入，领导工人开展增产竞赛。有些轧钢厂的党委还及时扭转了少数干部由于7月份超额完成计划而产生的自满松劲情绪，因此这几天来生产逐渐上升。8月6日比5日，钢材产量即增长七百一十四吨，7日又比6日增长一千三百八十七吨。9日又比7日提高三千一百八十吨。
    第一中板厂的职工提前完成8月上旬计划后，党委根据新的情况立即开会修改了增产条件，把原来计划两个月增产三千吨钢板，改为在一个月内实现。小型轧钢厂的职工们，听到第一中板厂两个月的增产指标要在一个月内完成，党委也立即召开会议，号召全体职工鼓起更大的革命干劲，力争把两个月增产四千吨钢材的计划在8月份一个月内完成，并且在9月份再为国家增产四千吨优质钢材，向国庆十周年献礼。
    现在，各轧钢厂的职工斗志昂扬，正乘胜前进，争取提前实现在国庆节前增产十万吨钢材的倡议条件。
    新华社10日讯　连续七个月超额完成生产计划的琉璃河水泥厂职工，奋战连雨天，提前完成了8月上旬的生产计划，给国家多生产了一千多吨水泥。这一旬的平均日产量，比7月上旬提高了一百零九吨，比下旬提高了七十吨，质量全部合格。
    这个厂的党委会，月初就发动全厂职工乘胜前进，掀起新的生产高潮。在连雨天中，露天开采的采石工人，冒雨到几十米高的山上去采石。8月份的前五天，天天超额完成采石任务。6日整天大雨，采石工人为了给7日生产作好准备，这一天就开采了四百多吨石灰石。由于原料供应充分，第二天使全厂超产二百四十八吨水泥完成日计划。看磨工人在水泥磨上实现了卷粉机加转的措施，提高了卷粉机的转速，使每小时产量由六十八吨提高到七十二吨，创造了这个工厂今年以来水泥生产的最高纪录。8月8日，工人们又把平均小时产量提高到七十三点六吨。烧成车间的职工在水泥窑上展开了窑际竞赛，坚持了班后评比制度。看火班二组还展开了安全运转百日竞赛，这个组产品高，安全好，到今天为止，已安全运转了一百三十五天。
