Coffee, cocoa, and tea are the world's three famous beverages. Among them, coffee has the highest consumption in the world, more than four times the consumption of tea.

The ripe, dark red coffee beans are picked, processed, and then stir-fried with sugar, butter, etc., and ground into fine powder, which is the coffee powder sold on the market. Coffee beans contain a biological alkali that stimulates the nerves and restores fatigue. Caffeine extracted from coffee can be used as a medicinal antispasmodic. Coffee essence made from coffee beans can also be used as a flavoring ingredient for candies. Coffee peels can also be used for brewing wine, fertilizer, and feed. Coffee wood can also be used for furniture.

The origin of coffee is North and Central Africa. Hainan Island started trial planting of coffee in 1908, when it was introduced by overseas Chinese in Nada County, but the planting was not large. It has been greatly developed after liberation, and it is now planted all over the island. (Attached picture)

    三大饮料之一咖啡
    咖啡、可可和茶是世界著名的三大饮料。其中以咖啡在世界上的消费量最多，比茶叶的消费量还多四倍。
    把成熟的深红色的咖啡摘下，经过处理加工，再加些糖、牛油等炒制并磨成细末，即为市场所售的咖啡粉，咖啡豆含有一种生物鹼，具有兴奋神经、恢复疲劳的作用。从咖啡里提炼出来的咖啡鹼，可作医药上的镇痉剂。用咖啡豆制成的咖啡香精，也可作糖果的调味原料。咖啡的果皮还可以酿酒及作肥料和饲料。咖啡的木材也可以作家具。
    咖啡原产地是非洲北部和中部。海南岛试种咖啡是在1908年，当时由华侨引种在那大县，但种植不多，解放后才得到较大的发展，目前全岛各地都有种植。（附图片）
