Xinhua News Agency report: The Ministry of Agriculture issued an urgent notice on the 9th, requiring the agricultural departments of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Shanxi, and Beijing and Tianjin to strengthen their leadership over the planting of Chinese cabbage, seize the opportunity, and complete the task of rushing to plant Chinese cabbage.

The notice said that now is an important season for rushing to plant Chinese cabbage. Missing the planting season will affect yields. Currently, some areas have excessive rainfall, while others are experiencing severe drought, affecting timely planting. Therefore, the agricultural departments in Chinese cabbage producing areas must vigorously mobilize the masses, properly arrange labor, actively fight drought and drain water, and do everything possible to complete the planting of Chinese cabbage.

The notice said that some areas temporarily unable to plant Chinese cabbage due to drought or flooding should now select well-drained areas near water sources to start seedlings in advance, preparing for transplanting. Areas that have already been planted should also fully consider the changeable climate this year, cultivate some vegetable seedlings, and prepare for replanting.

Xinhua News Agency report: Autumn is the peak season for incubating poultry. In order to achieve greater development in poultry production in the second half of the year, the Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice on the 8th to carry out autumn poultry incubation.

The notice pointed out that this year's spring poultry incubation work has achieved great results, with the number of poultry in many areas doubling. In order to lay a better foundation for this year's winter incubation and next year's spring incubation, we must build on the success of this year's spring incubation and continue to vigorously grasp autumn poultry incubation.

The notice requires people's communes in all localities to vigorously rectify and increase the number of various incubation rooms in communes and teams to expand production. All incubation rooms should vigorously improve technology and increase the hatching rate. Launch a mass movement of thousands of households incubating poultry, widely mobilize and organize commune members to carry out autumn incubation, and strive for each household to incubate another brood in the second half of the year.

The notice pointed out that earnestly solving the problem of insufficient hatching eggs is still the central link in carrying out autumn poultry incubation. We must continue to educate commune members to "incubate before eating" and keep more hatching eggs. Commercial departments should also first meet the needs of autumn incubation hatching eggs and then purchase and transfer them. It is necessary to actively organize commune members to exchange roosters and adjust surpluses and deficiencies to improve the fertilization rate of hatching eggs.

At the same time, attention should be paid to protecting superior poultry breeds in order to expand breeding next year.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice on August 8, requiring the agricultural (animal husbandry) departments of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities to seize the opportunity, make arrangements, and launch a large-scale silage forage campaign this autumn.

The notice said that in recent years, due to the importance attached by leaders in various localities, silage feed has been increasing year by year from point to point, playing a certain role in solving the problem of insufficient livestock forage. However, the promotion speed of silage feed is far from keeping up with the needs of livestock development. Therefore, this year, all localities must effectively carry out the work of silage feed. All areas planting corn, sweet potatoes, and peanuts should try their best to ensile the stalks and vines of these crops. At the same time, this year there is more rain and lush weeds in some places, and many places have experience in silage. These favorable conditions should be fully utilized to ensile a large amount of weeds, striving to ensure that every head of livestock and pig can eat a certain amount of silage feed in winter and spring to ensure that livestock are full of fat and full of pregnancy.

In order to ensure the work of silage feed, the notice requires all localities and people's communes to immediately formulate silage plans and specific measures based on the number of livestock and the amount of silage raw materials, arrange them layer by layer, and implement them to the contracted production units. At the same time, all areas that have not yet carried out silage feed work in the past should seize the time to conduct technical training, run short-term training classes or organize visits to impart technology. All areas that have already carried out a large amount of this work in the past should also organize on-site exchange conferences for silage technicians at the commune or county level before the start of silage feed, summarize the past work, and effectively promote good experiences. Achieve technical popularization and technical proficiency, ensuring that each silage pit is successful, and the quality of silage feed in each pit is good.

The notice pointed out that silage feed is a time-sensitive task, and the silage period is also the busy season of the three autumn harvests. Therefore, all localities and people's communes must make overall arrangements for the labor required for silage feed, so that the three autumn harvests and silage feed are not delayed.

Regarding the preparation of silage feed, the notice requires all localities to immediately start repairing and excavating silage pits, and prepare silage chopping tools and transportation tools. If they are damaged, they should be repaired immediately, and if they are insufficient, they should be quickly added. And improve the original silage tools and promote new silage tools to improve silage efficiency.

　　农业部通知
　　抓紧季节多种大白菜
　　要做好家禽秋孵工作
　　青贮饲料要及早准备
    据新华社讯　农业部9日发出紧急通知，要求河北、河南、山东、陕西、内蒙古、辽宁、山西和北京、天津等省、区（市）的农业部门，加强对大白菜播种工作的领导，抓紧时机，完成抢种大白菜的任务。
    通知说，现在正是抢种大白菜的重要时节，如果错过播种季节，就会影响产量。目前，有些地区下雨过多，有些地区旱象严重，影响适时播种。因此，出产大白菜地区的农业部门必需大力发动群众，妥善安排劳动力，积极抗旱、排涝，千方百计的完成大白菜的播种工作。
    通知说，有些因干旱或水涝而暂时无法播种大白菜的地区，现在要选择排水良好和靠近水源的地方先行育苗，准备移栽。已播种过的地区，也要充分估计到今年气候多变的情况，培育一部分菜苗，准备补栽。
    据新华社讯　秋季正是孵化家禽的旺季，为了使下半年家禽生产有更大的发展，农业部8日发出开展家禽秋孵工作的通知。
    通知指出，今年家禽春孵工作已经取得很大成绩，许多地区的家禽数量都成倍的增长。为了给今年冬孵和明年春孵打下更好基础，必须在今年春季孵化的基础上乘胜前进，继续大抓家禽的秋季孵化。
    通知要求各地人民公社大力整顿和增建社、队的各种孵房，扩大生产。所有孵房都要大力改进技术，提高孵化率。开展千家万户的孵化家禽运动，广泛发动和组织社员进行秋孵，力争下半年每户再孵一窝。
    通知指出，认真解决种蛋不足问题，仍然是开展家禽秋孵的中心环节，要继续教育社员“先孵后吃”，多留种蛋。商业部门也要先满足秋孵种蛋需要，再收购外调。要积极组织社员串换公鸡，调剂有无，以提高种蛋受精率。
    同时，要注意保护优良禽种，以便明年扩大繁殖。
    新华社10日讯　农业部在8月8日发出通知，要求全国各省、区
  （市）的农（畜）业部门抓紧时机，作好安排，在今年秋季开展一个大规模的青贮饲草运动。
    通知说，几年来，由于各地领导的重视，青贮饲料由点到面逐年增加，对于解决牲畜饲草不足问题起了一定的作用。但是，青贮饲料的推广速度，还远远赶不上牲畜发展的需要。因此，今年各地必须把青贮饲料的工作切实作好，所有种植玉米、红薯、花生的地区都要尽可能的把这些作物的秸秆、藤蔓青贮起来。同时，今年有些地方雨水多，野草繁茂，许多地方又有青贮经验，应该充分利用这些有利条件大量青贮野草，力争每头牲畜和猪都能在冬春季节吃到一定数量的青贮饲料，以保证家畜满膘、满怀。
    为了保证作好青贮饲料的工作，通知要求各地和各人民公社根据家畜头数和青贮原料的多少，立即制定青贮计划和具体措施，逐层布置，落实到包产单位。同时，凡是过去还没有开展青贮饲料工作的地区，都要抓紧进行技术训练，开办短期训练班或组织参观，传授技术。凡是过去已经大量开展这个工作的地区，也应该在青贮饲料开始前以公社或县为单位组织青贮技术员现场交流大会，对过去工作加以总结，切实推广好的经验。作到技术普及技术熟练，保证贮一窖成一窖，窖窖青贮饲料质量好。
    通知指出，青贮饲料是时间性很强的工作，而青贮时期又是三秋农忙季节，因此，各地和各人民公社必须统筹安排青贮饲料所需要的劳动力，作到三秋和青贮饲料两不误。
    关于青贮饲料的准备工作，通知要求各地马上动手整修和开挖青贮窖，并且准备好青贮切碎工具和运输工具，对坏了的应即进行补修，不足的迅速添置。并改良原有青贮工具和推广新的青贮工具以提高青贮工效。
