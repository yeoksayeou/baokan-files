　　The Heart of Poland
　　By Our Correspondent Jun Qiang

　　A Polish friend said it well: if Warsaw is the head of Poland, then Krakow is its heart.
　　Indeed, Krakow is a passionate, stirring heart. It's very much like a mirror, reflecting both Poland's national culture and the remarkable achievements of socialist Poland over the past fifteen years. It is ancient, peaceful, and beautiful, yet also very young.
　　We were immediately drawn to Krakow's scenery upon arrival. In the city's central square, the statue of Mickiewicz warmly watches the passersby around him. Flocks of pigeons swirl around, swooping to snatch breadcrumbs offered by passersby. Just twenty paces from the statue, a riot of colorful flowers blooms under brightly colored parasols, attracting pedestrians – this is the flower market. What a great location these florists have chosen! One side of the square is the famous Sukiennice market selling handicrafts, and next to the market is St. Mary's Church, its two spires stretching towards the sky, so beautiful and serene. Standing in this graceful and tranquil square is like listening to a favorite musical movement or admiring a brilliant masterpiece. We lingered in this square several times, each time reluctant to leave. But as we looked more closely at Krakow and learned about its life, our mood could no longer remain calm. This famous cultural city in southern Poland, this heart of Poland, deeply moved us.
　　When I say Krakow is ancient and young, let me start with its antiquity.
　　This famous city in southern Poland was established in the tenth century and served as the capital of Poland for five hundred years. Precisely because of this, it has preserved more than seven hundred historical sites and some ancient customs. For example, St. Mary's Church in the central square is an ancient building. People passing by cannot help but look up at its beautiful, towering spires. It's not just because the golden crown encircling the church spire is dazzling and inviting, but also because of the small windows on the spire. Every hour, a trumpeter blows two familiar phrases from these windows in all directions, phrases that all Polish people know. The sound is resonant and moving, but it stops abruptly, the music unfinished.

　　This unfinished trumpet call contains a legendary tale of heroism. It is said that in the thirteenth century, when the Tatars invaded Poland, the watchman on the bell tower sounded the alarm, calling on the people to rise up and defend their homeland. But he was shot through the throat by a Tatar arrow while he was still playing, and the trumpet call was cut short. Since then, Krakow has repeated the unfinished call of this trumpeter, who sacrificed himself to warn the people, every hour, every day, at St. Mary's Church, right up to the present. Krakow not only has St. Mary's Church and the famous Wawel Castle and many other famous historical sites, but it also has close ties with the working class's movement for liberation. Next to St. Mary's Church is a café. When Lenin lived in the Krakow province from 1912 to 1914, he often came here to drink coffee and read foreign newspapers. And in the small town of Poronin, not far from Krakow, in a small wooden house inhabited by Polish mountain people, Lenin convened a central conference of the Bolshevik Party.
　　The Krakow workers' great uprising of 1923 and subsequent strike movements have also added glorious chapters to Krakow's revolutionary history.
　　Ancient Krakow is a moving epic, but even more moving is the young Krakow, the new life that the people's government has brought to it.
　　Of Krakow's six districts, the largest is Nowa Huta, famous throughout Poland. The name Nowa Huta means New Steelworks because the new steelworks named after Lenin were built here, so the district was named "Nowa Huta." Ten years ago, Nowa Huta was a field, the only sound audible being the gentle whisper of crops in the wind. Now, the din of machines has replaced that tranquil pastoral symphony. It has become a metallurgical complex producing more than one million tons of steel annually, with a population of 100,000, and a small new city – a completely new district of Krakow – has been built. The factory is striding forward in socialist steps. By 1965, the factory will be doubled in size, with steel production reaching 3.8 million tons per year. The blast furnace currently under construction has a volume of 1,700 cubic meters. How can the Polish people not be proud of such scale and ambition!
　　In Krakow, the examples that mark its ancient and youthful qualities are truly countless. It has Europe's oldest Jagiellonian University, where Copernicus studied. In three years, this school will celebrate its 600th anniversary. However, since the Polish people have been masters of their own affairs for fifteen years, this ancient university has been completely transformed. It now has many departments, including a department for the study of atomic energy. The original ancient site has become a museum. In addition, there are eleven other institutions of higher learning in Krakow that, along with the Jagiellonian University, are cultivating Poland's younger generation. Eight of these were newly built after liberation.

　　Krakow is one of the few cities in Poland that was not destroyed by the war. At that time, the rapid advance of the Soviet army under the command of Marshal Konev preserved this famous city. But its people, like the people in other parts of Poland, suffered greatly from the war and experienced heroic struggles. The burial ground of four million innocent people, known worldwide – the Auschwitz concentration camp established by the Hitlerite fascists – is located near Krakow. We saw the crematory ovens, the two tons of hair that the fascists did not have time to transport, the mountains of shoes and glasses, the small courtyard where 70,000 people were shot, and the electric fences with a voltage of 6,000 volts… Our hearts surged to our throats. A Krakow journalist who accompanied us on the tour had lived in this concentration camp for more than three years. Although it was an inhuman life, he, like many other Poles, always persisted in the anti-fascist struggle. Now, right in Auschwitz, next to the old concentration camp site, the Polish working class has built a huge synthetic rubber factory. The workers completed it ahead of schedule to celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of Poland's National Day. The people of Krakow, like all Polish people, use this kind of socialist construction enthusiasm to remember this blood debt. The rubber factory started production on July 2, and Comrade Gomulka came from Warsaw in person to attend the opening ceremony.
　　How can these things not be moving! But what also moves us is the friendship of the Polish people towards the Chinese people. When we came out of Wawel Castle after our visit, a primary school student named Jurek recognized us as Chinese and followed us all the way to the hotel. The next morning, the child actually brought us gifts – pictures, badges, etc. That same day at midnight, we met several young Polish girls at the entrance of the hotel. As soon as they saw us, they said "Hello!" in Chinese and put flowers in our hands…
　　And so, with excited hearts and warm friendship, we said goodbye to Krakow – the heart of Poland – and continued our journey to visit our fraternal country – Poland. (Attached photo)

　　波兰的心
　　本报记者　君强
    一位波兰朋友说得好，如果把华沙比作波兰的头，那么克拉科夫就是波兰的心。
    的确，克拉科夫是一颗热血沸腾的、令人激动的心。它非常像一面镜子，既反映了波兰的民族文化，同时也反映了社会主义波兰十五年的卓越成就。它古老、和平而美丽，同时又非常年轻。
    我们来到克拉科夫，立刻就被它的景色吸引住了。在城中央的广场上，密茨凯维支的纪念像亲切地看着他周围过往的行人，成群的鸽子在四周飞绕，向过路人喂它们的面包屑扑去。距这个纪念像二十来步的地方，一片五彩缤纷的花朵在五颜六色的小遮阳伞下争奇斗妍，吸引着行人，这是鲜花市场。这些卖花人选择了一个多么好的市场啊！广场一面是卖手工艺品的有名的苏肯尼采市场，市场旁边是圣玛丽亚教堂，它那两个伸向天空的尖顶，那样美丽而安详。站在这优美恬静的广场上，像是听着一曲喜爱的乐章，又像是欣赏一幅出色的名画。我们曾几次徘徊在这个广场上，每次都是留连忘返。但是当我们再仔细看看克拉科夫，认识一下它的生活时，心情就再也平静不下来了。这座波兰南部的文化名城，这颗波兰的心，深深地激动了我们。
    说克拉科夫古老而年轻，让我先从它的古老说起。
    波兰南部的这座名城从十世纪起就开始建立了，曾有五百年是波兰的都城。也正是因为这一点，它才留下了七百多项古迹和一些古老的风习。例如，市中心广场上的圣玛丽亚教堂，是一所古老的建筑。人们走过这里时，会不由得仰起头来，看它那美丽的高耸入云的尖顶。这不仅因为教堂尖顶上绕着的那个金黄色的王冠闪烁诱人，更吸引人的还是尖顶上那几扇小窗子。因为每小时都有一个号手从这几个窗口向四面吹起波兰全国人民都熟悉的两句号声，号声高吭动人，但却是嘎然而止，乐音未完。
    这未吹完的号声中包含着一个传奇式的英雄的传说。据说在十三世纪鞑靼人入侵波兰时，钟楼上的守卫者吹起警号，向人民报警，号召大家起来保卫家乡。但是他正吹到一半，就被鞑靼人的箭射穿了喉咙，号声中断了。从此，克拉科夫人在圣玛丽亚教堂就每一小时每一小时重复这位向人民发出警号而牺牲自己的号手的未完的号声，一直到现在。克拉科夫不仅有圣玛丽亚教堂，也不仅有著名的瓦维尔宫和其他许多名胜古迹，而且它同工人阶级争取解放的运动也有着密切的联系。就在圣玛丽亚教堂旁边，有一个咖啡店。当1912年到1914年列宁住在克拉科夫省的时候，列宁时常到这里来喝咖啡，看外国报纸。而在距克拉科夫市不很远的小镇波罗宁诺，在波兰山民住的小木房里，列宁曾召开过布尔什维克党的中央会议。
    克拉科夫工人1923年的大起义和以后的罢工运动，也都给克拉科夫革命历史增添了光荣的篇章。
    古老的克拉科夫是一首动人的史诗，但是更动人的是年轻的克拉科夫，是人民政权带给它的新的生命。
    在克拉科夫市的六个区中，最大的一个区就是闻名波兰国内外的诺瓦胡塔。诺瓦胡塔这几个字的意思就是新钢铁厂。因为在这儿建起了以列宁的名字命名的新钢铁厂，所以这个区也就以“诺瓦胡塔”为名了。十年前的诺瓦胡塔是一片田地，听得见的只是微风吹动下庄稼的低语。如今机器的喧闹声代替了那宁静的田园交响乐章。这儿成了年产一百多万吨钢的冶金联合企业，人口已达十万，同时还建起了一座小的新城市——克拉科夫的一个崭新的区。工厂正在迈着社会主义的步伐大踏步继续前进。到1965年，工厂要扩建一倍，钢产量要达到年产三百八十万吨。目前正在建设中的高炉，是容积一千七百立方米的。这种规模和气魄，波兰人民怎能不引以自豪呢！
    在克拉科夫，标志着它那古老而年青的事例，真是数不胜数。它有欧洲最古老的雅格隆大学，哥白尼曾在这儿读过书，再过三年这所学校就要庆祝建校六百周年了。但是，自从波兰人民自己当家作主十五年来，这所古老的大学已完全改观了，它现在已经设有许多科系，包括研究原子能的科系，原有的古老校址已成了博物馆。此外，在克拉科夫还有十一所高等学校同雅格隆大学一道培养着波兰的年青一代。其中八所是解放后新建的。
  　克拉科夫是波兰少数没有受到战争破坏的城市之一。当时由于苏联元帅科涅夫指挥的苏军的迅速挺进，保住了这座名城。但是它的人民却同波兰其他地方的人民一样，饱受了战争的苦难，经历过英勇的斗争。世界上无人不知的四百万无辜人民的墓地——希特勒法西斯建立的奥斯威辛集中营，就在克拉科夫城附近。我们看到了集中营里那烧人炉、那法西斯分子没有来得及运走的两吨头发，那堆积如山的鞋子和眼镜，那曾枪杀过七万人的小院子，那电压高达六千伏特的电网……我们的心涌向了喉头。陪同我们参观的一位克拉科夫的新闻工作者，就曾在这个集中营住过三年多，虽然那是非人的生活，但是他和许多其他波兰人一样，始终坚持着反法西斯的斗争。现在，就在奥斯威辛，在集中营旧址旁边，波兰的工人阶级建立起了一个规模巨大的合成橡胶厂。工人们为了迎接波兰十五周年国庆，提前把它建成了。克拉科夫人同所有波兰人民一样就是用这样的建设社会主义的热情来记住这笔血债。橡胶厂7月2日开工了，哥穆尔卡同志亲自从华沙赶来出席了开工典礼。
    这些事怎能不令人激动呢！可是让我们激动的还有波兰人民对中国人民的友情。我们从瓦维尔宫参观出来的时候，一个名叫尤列克的小学生认出了我们是中国人，就一直跟我们来到旅馆。第二天大清早，这个孩子居然给我们送来了礼物——画片、纪念章等。也是这一天的午夜，我们在旅馆门口遇到几个年轻的波兰姑娘。她们一看到我们就用中国话说：“你好！”同时把鲜花塞到我们手里……
    我们就这样怀着激动的心情，带着亲切的友情告别了克拉科夫——波兰的心，继续踏上了我们访问我们的兄弟国家——波兰的旅程。（附图片）
