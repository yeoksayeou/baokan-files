Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the Japan National Relief Association on the 7th, stating: Chinese workers are closely watching the final verdict by the US-Japan reactionaries on the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," who have been wrongly imprisoned for ten years. We once again wholeheartedly support your just struggle and resolutely demand that all innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" be declared not guilty. The telegram wishes the struggle to support the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" a final victory.

The Japanese Supreme Court announced at 10:00 AM on July 27th that it would pronounce the verdict on the "Matsukawa Incident" at 10:00 AM on August 10th, and immediately began handling the procedures related to the verdict. The defendants have been wrongly imprisoned for ten years and have suffered all kinds of torment. Our team of lawyers has done everything possible to prove that the defendants are innocent.

The Fukushima District Court and the Sendai High Court in the first and second trials, which sentenced the innocent defendants to death, life imprisonment, and other heavy penalties, are not different in nature from the third trial in the Supreme Court. Many of the judges in the Supreme Court are the most reactionary figures, and they want to hold on to the Supreme Court as a stronghold of conservative forces. However, compared to the second trial verdict five years ago, public opinion on the "Matsukawa Incident" has changed.

From August 17, 1949, when the incident occurred, to December 6, 1950, when the first trial verdict was held, the struggle for a fair trial was almost entirely due to the dedicated activities of lawyers Tatsuo Okabayashi and Kazuo Otsuka and the small-scale appeals of the defendants' families. In mid-1950, the Japanese Communist Party unfortunately split. In June of the same year, the American occupiers banned the legal activities of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party and its main activists, and ordered the party's central organ, the "Akahata" newspaper, to cease publication, plunging the party into a semi-underground state. Under these circumstances, the assistance of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japan National Relief Association to the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" also almost came to a standstill. Moreover, at that time, it was when American imperialism launched its war of aggression against Korea, and the trial was conducted with the direct participation of American imperialists. The first trial verdict was made under such circumstances.

After the first trial verdict, the defendants were transferred to Sendai Prison because of their appeals. Despite the strict restrictions of the prison and the lack of money, they wrote letters to progressives from all walks of life throughout the country through various channels to appeal for help. To date, they have sent out at least 130,000 letters, and it is said that they have received 65,000 replies.

In response to the defendants' appeals, 129 lawyers participated in the defense work free of charge before the start of the second trial, and later this number increased to 179. The lawyers included knowledgeable people from the Liberal Democratic Party and communists. They united on the point of upholding justice, regardless of their thoughts, beliefs, or party affiliations.

The defendants' biggest concern in the struggle was the lack of money. At this time, the defendants' communication activities and the activities of the "Families Association" required several times more funding than in the first trial. However, the relief funds could not keep up with the needs. The staff of the Fukushima Branch of the Japan National Relief Association and the "Northeast Regional Council for Matsukawa Incident Countermeasures" even worked as peddlers to sell "natto" (steamed and fermented soybeans, a side dish) to raise funds. Before July 1951, the defendants could not even afford the paper to write their indictments. At that time, members of the "Anti-Dismissal League" of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Employees' Union (composed of people who had been purged in the "rectification") responded to the National Relief Association's appeal and donated 150,000 yen from their retirement funds. What saved the situation were the Japanese living in China and the Chinese people. During the second trial, 6 million yen in aid was sent from China.

At this time, the broad masses of Japanese workers also began to actively support the struggle of the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" through organized activities. In June 1951, the National Convention of the All-Japan Harbor Workers' Union protested the first trial verdict. In December of the same year, the Northeast Regional Conference of the Japan Teachers' Union passed a resolution demanding a fair trial for the "Matsukawa Incident." In 1952, the National Federation of Shipbuilding Industry Workers' Unions, the Niigata Branch of the National Railway Workers' Union, the Federation of Local Government Employees' Unions, and the Japan Teachers' Union, etc., all launched struggles demanding a fair trial. In 1953, many more industrial unions passed resolutions demanding a fair trial. In particular, the resolution of the National Convention of the National Railway Workers' Union in June of the same year and the resolution of the "Sohyo" (General Council of Trade Unions of Japan) Congress in July were of great significance in the history of the "Matsukawa Incident" struggle. The National Railway Workers' Union, which had once stood at the forefront of the trade union movement, was continuously persecuted under the enemy's rampant attacks in 1949 through the "Shimoyama Incident," the "Mitaka Incident," and the "Matsukawa Incident." Almost all the militant trade union members were driven out, and the leadership of the trade union was usurped by right-wing social democrats colluding with American imperialists, thus degenerating into the weakest and most reactionary trade union. However, only four years after the "Matsukawa Incident," this trade union stood up again. This congress passed a resolution demanding a fair trial for the "Matsukawa Incident" by an overwhelming majority.

Many people began to care about the "Matsukawa Incident." Since October 1951, seven groups of dozens to hundreds of investigators have gone to the site to personally investigate the incident. People from the cultural circles also began to join the struggle. In 1952, the defendants' handwritten records, "Truth Breaks Through Prison Walls," were published, which also collected articles by many people in the literary and art circles. In May 1953, the reason why Mr. Kazuhiro Hirotsu and Mr. Hiroshi Uno decided to attend the public trial was that they were inspired by this collection of articles. Hiroshi Uno published "A Strange Tale of the World" in the October issue of "Bungei Shunju"; Kazuhiro Hirotsu published "Truth is Accusing" in the October issue of "Chuo Koron." This made people more concerned about the incident.

The struggle in the second trial period was still centered on the court struggle, and there was not yet a full understanding that this struggle was a part of the people's struggle for democracy. However, after the second trial verdict in December 1953, the movement to rescue the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" was greatly different. Kazuhiro Hirotsu began to publish a long series, "'Matsukawa Incident' Trial," in "Chuo Koron" from April 1954, which continued for four and a half years. Kazuhiro Hirotsu stood at the forefront of the struggle to rescue the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." At his call, more than 500 people from the cultural circles, "Sohyo," and other democratic groups became the initiators of the rescue movement. In this way, the funds necessary for the struggle were resolved through donations from various sources.

Most of the defendants were successively released on bail from around the time of the second trial and participated in the struggle outside the prison. Relying on the organizations of the National Relief Association and the Japanese Communist Party, they appealed to the working class and the people, and carried out the struggle in a more organized and regular manner.

Since the Central Committee of the National Railway Workers' Union and the Central Committee of the Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company Workers' Union made decisions on retrials and financial support for the defendants and their families in January 1954, the working masses have held more workers' congresses, county union congresses, etc., than before, demanding the rescue of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" and a fair trial. At the July 1954 Congress, "Sohyo" passed a resolution demanding a retrial, assistance to the defendants and their families, and publicity in its organ newspaper. In June 1955, "Sohyo" also passed a resolution to send the defendants who had been released on bail to various places as "Sohyo" organizers. This showed that the struggle of the Japanese working class to rescue the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" had made progress.

At the same time, "Defendant Protection Associations for the 'Matsukawa Incident'" and "Friends Associations of the Defendants in the 'Matsukawa Incident'" were organized in various places. Now these groups have reached 300. The "Matsukawa Protection Association" centered in Tokyo established the "Tokyo Metropolitan Matsukawa Incident Roundtable Conference" and developed into the "Matsukawa Incident Countermeasures Council" in March 1958. In the past, on-site investigations were mostly conducted at the request of the "Liaison Committee," but in the third trial struggle, it has become a mass activity, with hundreds of people participating in the investigation. There were 465 people in 1956, 808 people in 1957, and 1,000 people in 1958. When the Supreme Court began the third trial oral argument in November 1958, the groups rescuing the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" organized a 15-day "Matsukawa Incident" march from Sendai to Tokyo, covering a total of 443 kilometers.

In recent years, the Japanese people's movement to support the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" has formed an increasingly large momentum along with a series of struggles by Japanese workers and people demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs, opposition to bases, opposition to the "Performance Rating System," opposition to the revision of the "Police Duties Law," and currently opposition to the revision of the Japan-US "Security Treaty." After the Supreme Court held the third trial oral argument in November last year, the struggle has achieved preliminary victories. On July 1 this year, the three defendants (Shin Suzuki, Saburo Sugiura, and Noboru Honda) who were sentenced to death in the second trial have also been released on bail. Defendant Shin Suzuki said at the 20,000-strong mass rally of the "Defendant Protection Associations for the 'Matsukawa Incident' and the 'Sunagawa Incident'" held in Tokyo on July 9: "Our struggle is a part of the liberation struggle of the Japanese working class and all the people. We vow to fight resolutely to the final victory."

    “松川事件”斗争的十年
    日本　守屋典郎
    新华社8日讯　中华全国总工会7日打电报给日本国民救援会说：中国工人密切地注视着美日反动派对冤狱十年的“松川事件”无辜被告的最后宣判，再一次衷心地支持你们的正义斗争，坚决要求宣判“松川事件”全体无辜被告无罪。电报祝支援“松川事件”被告的斗争获得最后的胜利。
    日本最高裁判所在7月27日上午十时宣布，将于8月10日上午十时对“松川事件”宣判，并立即着手办理与宣判有关的手续。被告们身系冤狱达十年之久，受尽折磨，我们律师团已尽自己所能，证明了被告们是无辜的。
    对无辜被告判处死刑、无期徒刑等重刑的第一审福岛地方裁判所和第二审仙台高等裁判所，同第三审最高裁判所在性质上没有什么不同。最高裁判所的许多审判官都是最反动的人物，他们要把最高裁判所作为保守势力的大本营固守到底。但是今天同五年前第二审判决时相比，社会上对“松川事件”的看法已经发生了变化。
    从1949年8月17日事件发生后到1950年12月6日举行第一审判决为止，争取公正审判的斗争，几乎只有冈林辰雄、大冢一男两位律师的献身活动和被告家属们的小规模的呼吁活动而已。1950年年中，日本共产党不幸发生分裂，美国占领者在同年6月禁止日本共产党中央和主要活动家的合法活动，勒令党中央机关报“赤旗报”停刊，使党陷于半地下状态。在这种情况下，日本共产党和日本国民救援会对“松川事件”被告的援助也几乎陷于停顿。而且，那时正是美帝国主义发动侵朝战争的时候，审判是在美帝国主义者直接参与下进行的。第一审判决就是在这样情况下作出的。
    第一审判决以后，被告们因为上诉，而被转移到仙台监狱。他们不顾监狱的严格限制和缺乏金钱，通过各种关系，写信给全国广大阶层的进步人士，进行呼吁。他们发出的信件，到今天为止至少已超过十三万封，而收到的回信据说也有六万五千封。
    为了响应被告团的呼吁，到第二审公开审判开始为止，已有一百二十九名律师无偿地参加辩护工作，后来又增加到一百七十九人。参加律师团的有自由民主党内有识见的人士，也有共产党员，他们不分思想、信仰和党派，在维护正义这一点团结在一起。
    被告们在斗争中感到最苦恼的是缺乏金钱。这时，被告们的通信活动、“家属会”的活动，都需要有比第一审时多几倍的经费。但是，救援资金无论怎样也是跟不上需要的。日本国民救援会福岛分会，“松川事件对策东北地区协议会”的人员，为了筹措经费甚至作小贩，去卖“纳豆”（蒸后醱酵的大豆，副食品）。在1951年7月以前，被告们连写起诉书用的纸张都买不起。当时东京都职员工会的“反对解雇同盟”（在“整肃”中被清洗的人们组成的）会员，响应国民救援会的呼吁，从退职金中捐献出十五万日元。挽救这种局面的是住在中国的日侨和中国人民。在第二审过程中，从中国寄来的援款达六百万日元。
    这时，日本的广大工人群众，也开始通过有组织的活动积极支持“松川事件”被告的斗争了。1951年6月，全港湾工会全国大会，抗议第一审判决。同年12月，日本教职员工会东北地区代表会议，通过了要求公正审判“松川事件”的决议。1952年全国造船业工会联合会、国营铁道工会新澙分会、自治体工会联合会，以及日本教职员工会等等，都掀起了要求公正审判的斗争。1953年又有许多产业部门的工会，通过了要求公正审判的决议。尤其是，同年6月国营铁道工会全国代表大会的决议和“总评”7月大会的决议，在“松川事件”斗争史上具有重要的意义。曾经站在工会运动最前面的国营铁道工会，在1949年敌人的猖狂进攻下，经过“下山事件”、“三鹰事件”和“松川事件”连续遭到迫害，几乎所有的战斗的工会会员都被赶走，工会领导权被同美帝国主义者勾结的右翼社会民主主义者篡夺，因而堕落成一个最软弱无力的反动性工会。但是，“松川事件”发生后只有四年的时间，这个工会又站起来了。这次大会以压倒的多数通过了要求公正审判“松川事件”的决议。
    许多的人都开始关心“松川事件”了。1951年10月以后，有七批数十人以至数百人的调查团到现地亲自调查这个事件。文化界人士也开始投入斗争。1952年出版了被告们的亲笔记录“真理冲破牢房四壁”，其中还收集了文学艺术界许多人的文章。1953年5月广津和郎、宇野浩两位先生之所以决心参加公审旁听的，就是因为受了这本文集的启发。宇野浩在同年十月号“文艺春秋”上发表了“天下奇谈”；广津和郎在“中央公论”十月号上发表了“真理在控诉”。这使人们更加关心这个事件了。
    第二审时期的斗争，仍然是以法庭斗争为中心，还没有充分地认识到这个斗争是人民争取民主斗争的一个环节。但是，1953年12月第二审判决后，救援“松川事件”无辜被告的运动，就大大不同了。广津和郎从1954年4月起开始在“中央公论”上发表长篇连载“‘松川事件’的裁判”，后来一直继续了四年半。广津和郎站在救援“松川事件”无辜被告斗争的前列。在他的号召下，五百多名文化界人士、“总评”及其他民主团体成了救援运动的发起人。这样，斗争所必需的资金，由于各方面的捐助而得到了解决。
    多数的被告从第二审前后起相继获得保释，并参加了狱外的斗争。他们依靠国民救援会和日共的组织，向工人阶级和人民群众发出呼吁，更加有组织地、经常地开展斗争。
    自从1954年1月国营铁道工会中央委员会、东京芝浦电气公司工会联合会中央委员会作出有关重新审判和资助被告及其家属的决议后，工人群众比以前更多地举行了产业部门的工人大会、县工会大会等等，要求救援“松川事件”无辜被告和公正的审判。“总评”在1954年7月大会上，通过了要求重新审判、援助被告及其家属以及在机关报上开展宣传的决议。1955年6月，“总评”并且通过决议，要把获得保释的被告们作为“总评”的组织员派到各地去活动。这表明，日本工人阶级救援“松川事件”无辜被告的斗争有了进展。
    同时，各地开始组织了“保卫‘松川事件’被告会”和“‘松川事件’被告之友会”。现在这些团体已经达到三百个。以东京为中心的“保卫松川会”，成立了“东京都松川事件恳谈会”，并于1958年3月发展为“松川事件对策协议会”。现地调查过去多半是由“联络人会”的请求而进行的，而在第三审的斗争中已经成了群众性的活动，参加调查的达数百人。1956年为四百六十五人，1957年为八百零八人，1958年为一千人。1958年11月最高裁判所开始第三审口头辩论时，救援“松川事件”无辜被告的团体组织了一次为期十五天、从仙台到东京全程四百四十三公里的“松川事件”大游行。
    几年来，日本人民对“松川事件”被告的声援运动，随着日本工人和人民群众要求禁止原子弹氢弹、反对基地、反对“勤务评定制度”、反对修改“警职法”以及目前反对修改日美“安全条约”等等一系列的斗争而形成了日益浩大的声势。到了去年11月最高裁判所举行第三审口头辩论后，斗争已获得了初步的胜利。今年7月1日，在第二审被判处死刑的三名被告（铃木信、杉浦三郎、本田升），也已获得保释出狱。被告铃木信并在7月9日东京举行的“保卫‘松川事件’、‘砂川事件’被告会”的两万人群众大会上说：“我们的斗争是日本工人阶级和全体人民解放斗争的一部分。我们发誓坚决斗争到最后胜利。”
