　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 11th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru today reiterated in the People's Assembly that India's view on the current situation in Laos is that the International Commission on Laos should be reconvened to help mediate and reconcile.
    Nehru said that the Indian government had been pointed out that the International Commission on Laos could not be reconvened without the consent of the Laotian government. He said, "However, a situation may arise in which the Laotian government will be willing and other national governments will be willing" to reconvene the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission meeting under the Geneva Agreement.
    Someone asked whether the current war was caused by military supplies from outside to the Laotian government. In answering this question, Nehru said, "This is a matter of interpretation and opinion." He explained that the Geneva Agreement only allowed France to maintain troops and prohibited all other countries from doing so. But now the French have withdrawn, and "according to the new agreement," the United States is going to send two hundred military personnel to Laos. He said: "On the one hand, this is a violation of the Geneva Agreement; on the other hand, it is not."
    Prior to this, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Menon, said in answering a question raised by fourteen members of parliament from various parties that India had suggested reconvening the meeting of the International Commission on Laos, but Canada opposed it. She said, "The Polish government has gladly agreed to reconvene this commission meeting." India has therefore contacted the two chairmen in order to take the necessary actions.
    She also said, "In view of the deteriorating situation in Laos, the Prime Minister has again written to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, and also to the Prime Minister of Laos and the Prime Minister of Canada," requesting the two chairmen to indicate what the Indian government and other relevant governments can do to begin to take methods of mediation and reconciliation in order to alleviate the tense situation and conflict in Laos.

### 尼赫鲁再谈老挝局势　认为应当重新召集国际委员会

　　尼赫鲁再谈老挝局势
　　认为应当重新召集国际委员会
    新华社新德里11日电　印度尼赫鲁总理今天在人民院重申，印度对目前老挝局势的看法是应当重新召集老挝国际委员会，以便帮助进行排解和调停。
    尼赫鲁说，有人向印度政府指出，没有得到老挝政府同意老挝国际委员会就无法重新召集。他说，“但是，可能产生一种情况，那时老挝政府将愿意而其他国家政府也愿意”根据日内瓦协议“重新召开国际监察和监督委员会会议”。
    有人问，是不是由于外边对老挝政府的军事供应而引起了目前的战事。尼赫鲁在答复这个问题时说，“这是一个解释和看法的问题”。他解释说，日内瓦协议只准许法国保持军队，而禁止所有其他的国家这样做。但是现在法国人已经撤退，而“根据新的协议”，美国要派两百名军事人员驻在老挝。他说：“一方面，这是违反日内瓦协议；另一方面，这又不是。”
    在这以前，外交部副部长梅农夫人在答复各党派的十四名议员提出的一个问题时说，印度曾经建议重新召开老挝国际委员会会议，但是加拿大反对这样做。她说，“波兰政府已欣然同意重新召开这个委员会会议。”印度因此向两位主席接洽，以便采取必要的行动。
    她还说，“鉴于老挝局势恶化，总理已再次写信给日内瓦会议两位主席，还写信给老挝首相和加拿大总理。”要求两位主席表明，印度政府和其他有关政府可以做些什么来着手采取调停与和解的方法以便缓和老挝的紧张局势和冲突。
