Xinhua News Agency, Athens, August 18th: The movement of the Greek and world public to overturn the military court's verdict on Glezos and other Greek patriots and to immediately release them is growing, greatly alarming the Greek reactionaries.

The Greek authorities are therefore stepping up the persecution of democrats, and have recently arrested a large number of democrats in Athens, Salonica, and other parts of Greece on charges of so-called "sabotaging the police system." According to "Dawn Daily," the gendarmerie and police authorities have recently been frequently summoning Greek citizens, demanding that they abandon democratic views, etc.

The Greek League for the Struggle for Human Rights published a statement in "Dawn Daily" on the 18th, resolutely protesting against the Greek authorities' behavior of undermining human rights. The statement also protested against the military court's verdict on Glezos, and demanded the abolition of Law No. 375 and other special laws, the restoration of democratic freedoms, and respect for human rights.

    害怕要求释放爱国者的运动高涨
    希腊当局加紧迫害民主战士
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社雅典18日讯：希腊和世界公众争取撤消军事法庭对格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者的判决和立即释放他们的运动日益高涨，使希腊反动派大为惊慌。
    希腊当局因而正在加紧迫害民主人士，最近逮捕了雅典、萨罗尼加和希腊其他地区的大批民主人士，罪名是所谓“破坏警察制度”。据“黎明日报”报道，最近宪兵和警察当局经常传讯希腊公民，要他们放弃民主观点等等。
    希腊争取人权斗争联盟在18日的“黎明日报”上发表一篇声明，坚决抗议希腊当局这种破坏人权的行为。声明还抗议军事法庭对格列索斯的判决，并且要求废除第三百七十五号法律和其他一些特别法律，恢复民主自由和尊重人权。
