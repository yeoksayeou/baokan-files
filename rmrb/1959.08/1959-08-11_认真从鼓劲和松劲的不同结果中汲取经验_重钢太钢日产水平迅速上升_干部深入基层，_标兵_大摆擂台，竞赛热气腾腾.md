Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 10th - Chongqing Steel Company's rival competitions between collectives and individuals are being carried out more extensively and deeply. From August 1st to 5th, the company's average daily steel production increased by 3.07% compared to the last five days of the previous month, and the qualification rate increased by 2.27% compared to the previous month. On the 6th and 7th, production was affected by heavy rain and power outages, but on the 8th and 9th, the average daily output increased by 4.91% compared to the 1st to 5th, and the quality was further improved. Some workshops that were originally lagging behind in production have quickly caught up with advanced levels; in particular, the quality of converter steel has made a larger leap forward, with an average qualification rate of 5.07% higher than the previous month from the 1st to the 5th. The qualification rate of converter steel in some shifts has reached over 95%. On the 6th and 7th, due to special circumstances such as heavy thunderstorms and power outages, production was affected and was abnormal; however, on the 8th and 9th, the company's average daily steel output increased by 4.91% compared to the average daily output from the 1st to the 5th, and the quality was further improved.

Since the beginning of August, the cadres and workers of this company have been in high spirits. Fifteen production "pacesetters" of the company, including Huang Rongchang, Zhang Wenjin, Ma Haiqing, and Yu Zhongguo, first jointly issued a proposal to all employees to carry out rival competitions. Then, more than two hundred collective "pacesetters" and tens of thousands of individual "pacesetters" throughout the company set up platforms and held contests, each selecting an opponent and proposing conditions to each other. Thus, a rival competition between workshops, sections, furnaces, teams, and individuals was launched even more vigorously. The Youth Red Flag Furnace of the Zhongshan Hall Converter Workshop and the No. 7 Youth Furnace of the Hongqiao Institute Converter Workshop are old rivals in the competition. Since August 1st, the workers of these two furnaces have continuously exchanged information, spread advanced experience, and worked hand in hand to maintain high quality and high output. The No. 3 furnace of the Hongqiao Institute Converter Workshop, which has a relatively large number of veteran workers, proposed to surpass the No. 7 Youth Furnace and strive to be named the "Old Huang Zhong" furnace. All the workers in the furnace humbly learned from the No. 7 furnace and conscientiously implemented experience such as rapid desulfurization, which rapidly increased production. The Zhongshan Hall Converter Workshop changed its past backward situation in the rival competition, and on August 3, it even achieved a daily output of thirty-eight furnaces, creating a new record for the workshop since entering the third quarter.

The production increase in August occurred after resolutely overcoming right-leaning and slackening sentiments and further deepening the leadership style.

Judging from the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company Party Committee's summary of production from January to July this year and the mobilization of the masses of employees for discussion in late July, in January and February, when the Party Committee grasped ideological work tightly, all cadres and employees had sufficient drive, the struggle to attack sulfur and seize steel was carried out vigorously, and production made great progress. In March and April, as the sulfur content of some pig iron raw materials increased, some cadres developed a sense of fear and slackening, and their drive was insufficient. As a result, steel production declined in April. At the end of April, after the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee held a six-level cadre meeting and criticized conservative ideas and fear of difficulties, production began to rise in a straight line from May. Many factories and workshops calculated several major accounts, further illustrating that as long as right-leaning sentiments were overcome and sufficient drive was mustered, the state plan could be well completed. For example, the workers of the Zhongshan Hall Converter Workshop calculated that if the average blowing time was maintained at thirty-three minutes, an additional 20,000 tons of steel could be produced in the second half of the year; coupled with continuing to improve quality, shorten non-production time, and extend furnace life, this year's production plan could be guaranteed to be completed.

Recently, many leading cadres of the company have conscientiously changed their style, gone deep into workshops, teams, and groups, strengthened the front line, and made production leadership work more solid. Because cadres directly participate in production leadership production, discover advanced, and support advanced. Seriously integrating with the masses, seeing the tremendous potential hidden in the masses, confidence is also sufficient. The workers saw that the cadres went to the workshop one after another, their enthusiasm was very high and their production enthusiasm was even higher. Ma Baoliang, the company's chief mechanical engineer, went deep into the open-hearth furnace plant and worked with the workers to solve the key problem affecting the production of the open-hearth furnace—the insufficient wind power of the air compressor. He originally expected that it would take a week to install the modified air compressor, but the installation workers were enthusiastic and enterprising, and it only took two days to install it.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 10th - Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, on the ideological basis of resolutely criticizing right-leaning sentiments, quickly launched a hot wave of increasing production and practicing economy. The average daily production level in the first eight days of August increased by 32.84% for pig iron, 10.77% for steel, and 7.75% for steel products, compared with the average daily production level of the previous month.

In the first few months of this year, the output of major products in pig iron, steel, and steel products of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company increased by about 25% compared with the same period last year, and production was in a situation of continued leap forward. However, in the past two months, some cadres did not adequately recognize the new leap forward situation and the favorable conditions for completing the annual plan, and developed right-leaning and slackening sentiments, which affected the enthusiasm of the workers. Recently, the company's Party Committee held a meeting of employee representatives and an expanded meeting of the Party Committee, resolutely criticizing this right-leaning thought. After the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-Leaning Sentiments, Practice Increasing Production and Practicing Economy" was published, the Party Committee organized employees to study, further improving the ideological understanding of cadres and the majority of employees, and stimulating the enthusiasm of employees. Then, a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy was launched.

Now, the Party Committee secretaries and factory directors of each factory have gone deep into the production site to study and solve the key problems in current production with the employees. The Party Committee secretary and factory director of the Ironmaking Plant jointly studied seven measures to improve the quality of raw materials with the employees, and organized the employees to restore and promote the original advanced experience, and increased the screening equipment for mineral powder, so that the iron content of the ore was increased from 43% to 48%. With the improvement of the quality of the ore, the utilization coefficient of the No. 1 blast furnace has been increased from two to two point three one, and the daily production level of pig iron in the whole plant from the 1st to the 8th has therefore increased by 34.45% compared with the same period last month. Some time ago, the primary rolling mill could only produce four of the six soaking furnaces that had been put into production because of insufficient gas supply. At this time, some cadres believed that if they wanted to increase the production of steel billets, they would have to add more gas equipment. Recently, after overcoming right-leaning thoughts, the Party Branch Secretary and employees worked together, starting from improving gas operation and improving gas quality, so that all six soaking furnaces began production. The majority of employees were deeply educated. They said: "Only by thoroughly overcoming right-leaning thoughts can we achieve this year's leap forward target."

The employees of many factories have actively revised their originally low production targets, leading cadres have gone deep into the grassroots level to strengthen production leadership, and the masses are full of enthusiasm, determined to greet the 10th anniversary of the National Day with greater achievements. The Ironmaking Plant originally believed that the supply conditions of raw materials were not good, and the annual plan was formulated with two million tons less than the national requirement; recently, after the factory Party Committee jointly studied with the workers, it was believed that as long as sufficient drive was mustered, the raw material conditions could be changed. Therefore, the planned target was restored to the original national requirement. The No. 2 open-hearth furnace of the Second Steelmaking Plant has always been backward. Recently, Wang Linshan, the Secretary of the factory Party Committee, participated in labor on this furnace and found that the current slow charging is the main reason for the long smelting time of the open-hearth furnace. Therefore, he organized the duty director and experienced old workers to personally direct the charging. As a result, the No. 2 open-hearth furnace first created a new smelting record, catching up with the advanced No. 3 open-hearth furnace. The employees of the No. 3 open-hearth furnace quickly caught up and continuously created new records. The Wang Haiqing group of Class B smelted a furnace of steel in eight point two minutes, shortening it by two hours compared to normal; the next day, the Ji Zhiming group of Class C smelted a furnace of steel in eight point zero six minutes, surpassing the Wang Haiqing group. As latecomers caught up, the utilization coefficient of the open-hearth furnace in this factory averaged seven point seven three five from the 1st to the 8th, an increase of zero point nine one two compared with the same period last month.

　　认真从鼓劲和松劲的不同结果中汲取经验
　　重钢太钢日产水平迅速上升
　　干部深入基层，“标兵”大摆擂台，竞赛热气腾腾
    据新华社重庆10日电　重庆钢铁公司各集体和个人之间的对手竞赛，开展得更加广泛深入了。8月1日至5日，全公司钢的平均日产量比上月最后五天提高了3.07％，合格率比上月提高了2.27％。6、7两日因大雨停电，影响生产，但8、9两日，平均日产量又比1日至5日增加4.91％，质量也有进一步提高。一些原来生产落后的车间，迅速赶上了先进水平；特别是转炉钢的质量跃进较大，1日至5日平均合格率比上月提高5.07％，有的班的转炉钢合格率已经达到95％以上。6、7两日因大雷雨、停电等特殊情况，影响生产不正常；但是，8、9两日，全公司钢的平均日产量又比1至5日的平均日产量增加4.91％，质量也有进一步提高。
    进入8月份以来，这个公司的干部和职工意气风发。公司的生产“标兵”黄荣昌、张文金、马海清、余忠国等十五人，首先联名向全体职工发出开展对手竞赛的倡议。接着全公司的二百多个集体“标兵”和上万个个人“标兵”，纷纷摆擂台，开比武大会，各自选好对象，互提条件。于是，一个车间对车间、工段对工段、炉子对炉子、班组对班组、个人对个人的对手竞赛，就更加轰轰烈烈地展开。中山堂转炉车间的青年红旗炉与虹桥院转炉车间七号青年炉，是竞赛老对手。从8月1日起，这两个炉子的工人们又不断地互通情报，传播先进经验，携手并进，双双保持了优质高产。虹桥院转炉车间老工人较多的三号炉，提出一定要超过七号青年炉，争取命名为“老黄忠”炉。全炉工人虚心向七号炉学习，认真贯彻执行快速脱硫等经验，使生产迅速上升。中山堂转炉车间在对手竞赛中，一改过去落后局面，8月3日更达到日产三十八炉，创造了本车间进入第三季度以来的新纪录。
    8月份的这种生产上升的局面，是在坚决克服右倾松劲情绪，领导作风更加深入以后出现的。
    从重庆钢铁公司党委7月下旬总结了今年1月至7月的生产和发动职工群众展开讨论的情况看来，1、2月份，当党委对思想工作抓得紧时，全体干部、职工干劲足，攻硫夺钢斗争开展得轰轰烈烈，生产很有起色。3、4月份，随着部分生铁原料硫份增高，有些干部就产生畏难松劲情绪，干劲不足，因而4月份钢的生产就走下坡路。4月底，当中共重庆市委召开六级干部大会，批判了保守思想和畏难情绪以后，从5月份开始，生产又成直线上升了。许多工厂、车间的职工算了几笔大账，进一步说明只要克服掉右倾情绪，鼓足干劲，就能很好地完成国家计划。如中山堂转炉车间的职工计算出：如果吹炼时间平均保持三十三分钟，就能使下半年多产二万吨钢；加上继续提高质量，缩短非生产时间，延长炉龄，今年的生产计划就能够保证完成。
    近来，公司许多领导干部认真改变作风，深入车间、班、组，加强第一线，使生产领导工作更加踏实。由于干部直接参加生产领导生产，发现先进，支持先进。认真地同群众打成一片，看到群众中蕴藏着巨大的潜力，信心也就足了。工人们看到干部纷纷下车间，干劲很大生产热情也更高。公司总机械师马宝良深入大平炉厂，同工人一起解决影响大平炉生产的关键——空气压缩机风力不足的问题，他本来预计要一个星期才能将改后的空气压缩机安装好，但是安装工人们热情奋发，只用两天时间就安装好了。
    据新华社太原10日电　太原钢铁公司在坚决批判右倾情绪的思想基础上，迅速掀起了增产节约竞赛热潮。8月份头八天的平均日产水平，同上月的平均日产水平比较，生铁增长了32.84％，钢增长了10.77％，钢材增长了7.75％。
    太钢在今年的前几个月，生铁、钢、钢材中的主要产品的产量，比去年同期增长了25％左右，生产处在继续跃进的局面。但是在最近两个月中，一些干部对这个新的跃进局面和完成全年计划的有利条件认识不足，滋长了右倾松劲情绪，影响了工人积极性的发挥。最近公司党委召开职工代表大会和党委扩大会议，坚决批判了这种右倾思想。人民日报社论“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”发表后，党委又组织职工学习，进一步提高了干部和广大职工的思想认识，激发了职工的干劲。接着展开了轰轰烈烈的增产节约竞赛。
    现在，各厂党委书记和厂长都深入到生产现场，同职工一道研究解决当前生产中的关键问题。炼铁厂党委书记和厂长跟职工共同研究出七项提高原料质量的措施，并且组织职工恢复和推广了原来的先进经验，增加了筛选矿粉设备，使矿石含铁量由43％提高到48％。随着矿石质量的提高，一号高炉利用系数已由二提高到二点三一，全厂1日到8日的生铁日产水平因而比上月同期提高了34.45％。初轧厂前些时候因为煤气供应不够，新投入生产的六个均热炉只有四个能生产，这时有些干部认为要想增产钢坯就只有再增加煤气设备。最近在克服右倾思想以后，党支部书记和职工一起，从改进煤气操作入手，提高了煤气质量，使六座均热炉都开始生产了。广大职工深深受到教育，他们说：“只有彻底克服右倾思想，才能实现今年的跃进指标。”
    许多厂的职工都主动地修订了原来较低的生产指标，领导干部都深入基层，加强了生产领导，群众也干劲十足，决心以更大成就迎接国庆十周年。炼铁厂原来认为原料供应条件不好，制订全年计划时比国家要求的少了两万吨；最近工厂党委跟工人共同研究以后，认为只要鼓足干劲，原料条件是可以改变的，因此，把计划指标恢复到原来国家要求的水平上。第二炼钢厂的二号平炉过去一直是落后的。最近工厂党委书记王林山在这个炉子上参加劳动，发现当前上料缓慢是平炉冶炼时间长的主要原因。于是，他便组织值班主任和有经验的老工人亲自指挥上料，结果二号平炉首先创造了冶炼新纪录，赶过了先进的三号平炉。三号平炉职工急起直追，又连续创造了新纪录。乙班王海清小组以八点二十分炼一炉钢，比平时缩短了两小时；第二天丙班冀志明小组又以八点零六分炼出一炉钢，超过了王海清小组。由于后进者赶了上来，这个厂的平炉利用系数在1日至8日平均达到了七点七三五，比上月同期提高了零点九一二。
