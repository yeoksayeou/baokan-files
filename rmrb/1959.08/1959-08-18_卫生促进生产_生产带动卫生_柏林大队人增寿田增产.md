Sanitation Promotes Production, Production Drives Sanitation
Berlin Brigade Sees Increased Lifespan and Increased Crop Yields

　　This newspaper reports: "Strong soldiers and horses, long life and bountiful harvests," is the praise given to the Berlin Brigade of the Daisi Commune in Fushun County by representatives from various counties in the Luzhou Special District of Sichuan after attending the on-site meeting on sanitation work in the Berlin Brigade.

　　The Berlin Brigade of the Berlin Management District, Daisi Commune, Fushun County, has been closely integrating with production since April of last year, adhering to the mass patriotic health campaign. Over the past year, work on eliminating the eight pests (the four pests plus cockroaches, lice, fleas, and bedbugs) and emphasizing hygiene has become routine. The sanitation situation has greatly improved, effectively promoting production.

　　In the winter of 1957, in the production appraisal of the nine agricultural cooperatives in the township, the Berlin cooperative ranked eighth, a third-class cooperative. This spring, in the management district appraisal, this production brigade has risen to become a first-class team.

　　Through eleven months of health campaigns, the Berlin Brigade presents a completely new look. Mosquito and fly breeding grounds have been dealt with, unsanitary open-air cesspools have been filled and sealed, toilets have been rebuilt, and double-pit latrines have been built according to the foundations. Feces are treated before being applied to the fields. Toilets are sealed and covered during normal times, wild herbs are added, and they are disinfected regularly to keep them free of maggots. The open ditches (without concealed pipes) have been thoroughly dredged and washed regularly to keep them clean all year round. Sewage pools and pits have all been filled. Each canteen has an incinerator, and garbage is promptly disposed of in the incinerator. Weeds around houses, ditches, and roads are cut clean. Pig and cattle pens are washed three times a day and swept three times a day, with no odor. The canteen is clean inside and out, and furniture is disinfected. In short, walking into the Berlin Brigade is refreshing and cheerful.

　　Good sanitation has greatly improved the health of the commune members. The four members of Chen Zongyu's family used to be notorious for being sickly, but now the sickly ones have become strong men who are doing great work in production. Since the second half of last year, the team has consistently maintained a 100% attendance rate. Over the past year, there have been no outbreaks of epidemics among livestock and poultry, and the number of chickens, ducks, geese, and rabbits has increased one and a half times compared to last year.

　　The Berlin Brigade's sanitation work is well done, first and foremost because the Party organization insists on ideological education, constantly solves ideological problems, and makes eliminating the eight pests and emphasizing hygiene a conscious action of the masses. At the beginning of the movement last year, some cadres believed that "doing sanitation would affect production," and some even said that "doing sanitation is neglecting one's proper duties." Some people thought that "rural residences are scattered and houses are small, making it impossible to be hygienic." At this time, the district committee organized a production and sanitation appraisal inspection. Cai Dairong, the Party branch secretary of the original Berlin Agricultural Cooperative, and cooperative cadres visited the Baohua Cooperative in Zhongshi Township, an advanced area in production and sanitation. The fact that Baohua Cooperative combined production with good sanitation greatly inspired them. After returning to the cooperative, they immediately organized members to visit and organized debates. They also held a physical exhibition of the hazards of the "eight pests" and carried out propaganda and education on hygiene knowledge. Commune members who had suffered from diseases for a long time due to lack of hygiene spoke from their own experiences. In this way, the benefits of eliminating the eight pests and emphasizing hygiene became increasingly deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

　　On the basis of raising awareness, the branch secretary took the lead and the cadres took the lead, launching a blitz. During the movement, the branch constantly used the achievements it had made to carry out propaganda and education among the members, making the members deeply aware that eliminating the eight pests and emphasizing hygiene could indeed play a role in increasing crop yields and lengthening people’s lives, and not only would it not affect production, it would greatly promote production. Therefore, most people not only actively and consciously invested in the sanitation movement, but also generally developed good habits of regular hygiene.

　　This brigade has always closely integrated sanitation work with production. Last year, "hygienic fertilizer" alone accumulated more than 6.44 million jin, making the team’s more than 1,000 mu of land apply an average of more than 3,000 jin of fertilizer per mu more than in previous years. Both the large and small spring crops have achieved large-scale production increases. Combined with grain and seed protection, mold and insect prevention, the "four-no" granary movement was carried out to vigorously eliminate rats, sparrows, and pests. Over the past year, more than 19,150 rats have been eliminated, more than 3,500 rat holes have been blocked, and 3,366 sparrows have been eliminated. A responsibility system for grain storage and a hygiene system have also been established. Since last year, all six storage rooms in the brigade have achieved no rats and sparrows, no mold and rot, no discoloration, and no insect pests. In addition, combined with the protection and development of livestock and poultry, the cleaning and hygiene of livestock and pens have been improved. Poultry implemented "shed breeding," not releasing chickens and ducks openly. This is not only clean and hygienic, but also does not trample crops, and accumulates fertilizer.

　　In terms of labor arrangement, they take production as the center. In addition to the blitz, they generally arrange the main labor force for production, and the regular sanitation work is carried out by the old, weak, women, children, cooks, feeders, manure managers, health workers, and other professionals. Because the pest and disease elimination work is closely integrated with production, the masses all support it and no longer consider it a burden. Zhang Xincai, the production team leader who originally thought that "doing sanitation is neglecting one's proper duties," also actively led the team members to do a good job in the team's sanitation work.

　　The combination of blitz and regularity is also one of the important reasons why the Berlin Brigade's pest and disease elimination work is lasting and solid. During the campaign, the team always controlled the five major mosquito and fly breeding grounds of toilets, open ditches, livestock pens, garbage, and canteens, and constantly carried out blitzes. Generally, a blitz was carried out every ten days, and it was also stipulated that a blitz should be carried out after rain to deal with sewage and waste after rain. In order to consolidate the results achieved in the blitz, in addition to doing a good job in basic sanitation construction (such as rebuilding toilets, building double-pit latrines, garbage incinerators, etc.), the Party branch mobilized the masses to discuss and establish a set of practical systems for regular sanitation work. For example, adopting "four fixes" (fixed person, fixed time, fixed task, fixed remuneration), "seven guarantees," etc. In addition, a duty rotation system was established with the house base and yard as the unit, and the yard was cleaned every day. At the same time, a system of one inspection per week and one appraisal every half month was established. Over the past year, these systems have always been adhered to very well, thus ensuring the regularity of sanitation work.

　　卫生促进生产　生产带动卫生
　　柏林大队人增寿田增产
    本报讯　“兵强马壮、人寿年丰”，这是四川泸州专区各县代表在富顺县代寺公社柏林大队参加过卫生工作现场会议以后，对柏林大队的赞词。
    富顺县代寺公社柏林管理区柏林大队，从去年4月起，紧密结合生产，把群众性爱国卫生运动坚持到底，一年多来，除八害（即四害加上蟑螂、虱子、跳蚤、臭虫）讲卫生工作做到了经常化，卫生面貌大大改观，有效地促进了生产。
    1957年冬，全乡九个社（农业社）生产评比，柏林社居第八位，是个三类社。今年春季，管理区评比，这个生产大队已上升为一类队。
    柏林大队通过十一个月的卫生运动，呈现出一片崭新面貌。蚊蝇孳生场所处理了，填封了不合卫生要求的露天粪坑，厕所进行了改建，并按屋基修建了人粪连二坑，粪便都经过处理然后下田，平时厕所密封加盖，投放野生药草，定期消毒，保持无蛆。阳沟（没有阴灌）彻底进行了疏掏，定期冲洗，终年保持干净，污水凼、坑全被填平。每个食堂都有一个焚化炉，垃圾渣渣及时在焚化炉内处理。房屋周围、沟边、路边的杂草铲得干干净净。猪牛栏圈三天洗刷一次，一天打扫三次，没有臭气。食堂做到内外清洁，家具消毒。……总之，走进柏林大队，令人精神爽快，心情舒畅。
    卫生搞得好，大大增进了社员的身体健康。社员陈宗瑜全家四口人，过去父子三人都是有名的药罐罐，现在药罐罐都变成了精壮汉，生产干得呱呱叫。去年下半年以来，全队经常保持了百分之百的出勤率。一年多来，牲畜家禽没有发生过瘟症，鸡鸭鹅兔比去年增加了一倍半。
    柏林大队的卫生工作做得好，首先是由于党组织坚持思想教育，不断解决思想问题，使除八害讲卫生成为群众的自觉行动。去年运动开展初期，有些干部认为“搞卫生会影响生产”，有的甚至说“搞卫生是不务正业”。有的群众认为“农村居住分散，房屋窄小，无法讲卫生”，正在这时，区委组织了一次生产卫生评比检查，原柏林农业社党支部书记蔡代荣和社干部参观了生产、卫生先进地区——中石乡百花社。百花社结合生产搞好卫生的事实，给了他们很大的启发。回社后立即组织社员去参观，并组织了辩论，还举办了“八害”危害的实物展览，和卫生常识的宣传教育，过去不讲卫生长期受疾病折磨的社员，现身说法。这样，除八害讲卫生的好处便日益深入人心。
    在提高认识的基础上，支书挂帅、干部带头，展开了突击运动。运动中，支部又不断以所取得的成绩，对社员进行宣传教育，使社员深切地认识到除八害讲卫生确实能起到田增产、人增寿的作用，不但不影响生产，还能大大促进生产。因而大多数人不仅积极自觉地投入卫生运动，而且普遍养成了经常讲卫生的良好习惯。
    这个大队一直是紧密结合生产开展卫生工作的。去年单“卫生肥”就积了六百四十四万多斤，使全队一千多亩田平均每亩比往年增施肥料三千多斤，大、小春作物都获得大面积增产。结合保粮保种、防霉防虫、开展“四无”粮仓运动，大力消灭鼠雀和虫害。一年多来，消灭老鼠一万九千一百五十多只，堵鼠洞三千五百多个，消灭麻雀三千三百六十六只。并建立了粮食保管责任制和清洁卫生制度。去年以来，全大队六个保管室做到了无鼠雀、无霉烂、无变色、无虫害。另外，还结合保护发展牲畜、家禽，搞好了牲畜和栏圈的清洁卫生工作。家禽实行了“棚圈喂养”，不放敞鸡敞鸭，这样既清洁卫生，不糟踏庄稼，又积了肥料。
    在劳力安排上，他们是以生产为中心，除突击运动外，一般都将主要劳力安排在生产上，经常性的卫生工作交由老弱妇幼及炊事员、饲养员、粪管员、卫生员等专业人员去搞。由于除害灭病工作紧密结合生产，群众个个拥护，再不认为是个负担，原来认为“搞卫生是不务正业”的生产队长张新才，也积极领导社员搞好了本队的卫生工作。
    突击与经常相结合，也是柏林大队除害灭病工作持久巩固的重要原因之一。运动中，该队始终控制住厕所、阴阳沟、牲畜圈、垃圾和食堂五大蚊蝇孳生场所，不断进行突击，一般十天突击一次，还规定雨后突击，处理雨后的污水污物。为了巩固突击运动所取得的战绩，除了搞好卫生基本建设（如改建厕所，建立连二坑、垃圾焚化炉等）外，党支部发动群众讨论，建立了一套切实可行的卫生工作经常化的制度。如采取“四定”（定人、定时、定任务、定报酬）、“七包”等。另外，以屋基院坝为单位建立了值日轮流制度，院坝天天打扫。同时，建立了一周一检查，半月一评比制度。一年多来，这些制度始终坚持得很好，从而保证了卫生工作经常化。
