Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: Commercial departments in various regions are currently actively transferring draft animals, farm tools, pesticides, chemical fertilizers, seeds, and other means of production, to prepare for the needs of the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting.

　　Commercial departments have transferred a large number of draft animals from pastoral areas and animal-producing regions to supply areas lacking draft animals. Before the end of July, Inner Mongolia, Guizhou, and other places had transported 26,366 draft animals to Hebei, Anhui, Shandong, Shanxi, Hubei, and other provinces. The 15,000 draft horses purchased and transferred out of Xinjiang are also being expedited from producing areas such as Yili and Tacheng, and can all be transported to various agricultural areas before the end of September. The commercial department of Inner Mongolia has also decided to transfer a portion of the draft animals planned for external transfer in the fourth quarter, to be transferred out in the third quarter in advance. The 7,026 draft horses recently imported from the Mongolian People's Republic are also being transported to key livestock-deficient areas. Commercial departments in various regions have also prepared for the sale and distribution of draft animals, so as to supply draft animals to communes and production brigades in a timely manner.

　　The National Hardware, Transportation, and Electrical Equipment Supply Conference recently convened by the Ministry of Commerce comprehensively deployed the supply of various tools and machinery required for the "Three Autumns" production, such as harvesting, threshing, processing, transportation, plowing, and sowing. The three provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Zhejiang have now arranged for the production of more than 50 varieties of farm tools, with 73.12 million products. Many regions have adopted methods such as "several checks" (checking the required varieties, quantities, specifications, and times), "several calculations" (calculating the source of goods, man-hours, raw materials, and materials), "several arrangements" (arranging production, adjustment, and supply), as well as holding production-sales balance meetings and exchange meetings, to arrange for the required "Three Autumns" production materials. Some regions have assisted industrial departments and communes and brigades in establishing farm tool processing plants (groups) to rush-produce and repair various small farm tools.

　　A large amount of chemical fertilizer used for topdressing cash crops such as cotton, flue-cured tobacco, jute, sugarcane, and vegetables is being transferred. In July, the Ministry of Commerce has allocated 219,000 tons of chemical fertilizer to various provinces; more than 150,000 tons of chemical fertilizer planned to be allocated in August have also been successively transferred; the chemical fertilizer planned to be allocated to Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces in September will be transferred in advance by 24,000 tons, to support these three provinces in production and disaster relief. The commercial departments in some areas implement the policy of self-reliance, looking for fertilizer sources locally to make up for the shortage of chemical fertilizers. For example, the Ruian County Commercial Bureau in Zhejiang Province recently established a Sea Fertilizer Company to collect sea fertilizer to support the people's communes in striving for a bumper late autumn harvest.

　　Commercial departments in various regions are also vigorously adjusting rapeseed to support the sowing of autumn vegetables in various regions. Shandong, Hebei, and Henan provinces have transferred more than 1 million catties of seeds of Chinese cabbage, radish, carrots, etc., to support areas lacking vegetable seeds in developing autumn vegetable production.

　　赶运耕畜　采购农具　调拨化肥
　　商业部门大调物资迎三秋
    据新华社18日讯　各地商业部门目前正在积极调运耕畜、农具、农药、化肥、种子等生产资料，为秋收、秋耕、秋种的需要作好准备。
    商业部门从牧区和出产牲畜地区调出了大批耕畜，供应缺少耕畜地区。内蒙古、贵州等地在7月底以前，已运了二万六千三百六十六头耕畜到河北、安徽、山东、山西、湖北等省。新疆收购、外调的一万五千匹耕马，也正从伊犁、塔城等产地陆续赶运出来，9月底以前可以全部运到各农业地区。内蒙古商业部门还决定将一部分计划在第四季度外调的耕畜，提前在第三季度内调运出来。最近刚从蒙古人民共和国进口的七千零二十六匹耕马，也正在运给重点缺畜地区。各地商业部门还作好了耕畜销售和分配的准备工作，以便及时将耕畜供应给公社和生产大队。
    商业部最近召开的全国五金、交通电工器材供应会议，全面部署了三秋生产所需的收割、脱粒、加工、运输、耕地、播种等各种工具和机械的供应工作。黑龙江、吉林、浙江等三个省现在已经安排生产的农具，有五十多个品种，七千三百一十二万件产品。许多地区采取“几查”（查需要品种、数量、规格、时间）“几算”（算货源、工时、原料材料）“几安排”（安排生产、调剂、供应）、以及召开产销平衡会议和交流会等办法，对所需的三秋生产资料作了安排。有些地区协助工业部门和公社、大队建立农具加工厂（组），赶制和修理各种小农具。
    供应棉花、烤烟、黄麻、甘蔗、蔬菜等经济作物追肥用的大量化肥，正在调运中。商业部在7月份已调给各省二十一万九千吨化肥；计划在8月份调拨的十五万多吨化肥，也已经陆续调运；计划在9月份调给广东、浙江、江西三省的化肥，将提前调运二万四千吨，支援这三个省生产救灾。有些地区的商业部门贯彻自力更生的方针，就地寻找肥源，弥补化肥的不足。如浙江省瑞安县商业局最近成立了海肥公司，收集海肥，支援人民公社争取晚秋作物大丰收。
    各地商业部门还大力调剂菜籽，支援各地播种秋菜。山东、河北、河南三省已调出大白菜、萝卜、葫萝卜等种子一百多万斤，支援缺菜籽的地区发展秋菜生产。
