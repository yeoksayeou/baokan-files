Quick Loading and Unloading

Cargo loading and unloading is an important part of the entire transportation process. As the saying goes, "It's not the slowness that's frightening, but the stops." If the speed of vehicles and ships is slow, that's certainly not good; but if the stay is too long, it will waste a lot of transportation capacity. Therefore, doing a solid job at stations, docks, and ports, with quick loading and unloading, is of great significance for accelerating the turnover of vehicles and ships, improving transportation efficiency, shortening the delivery time of materials, and enabling materials to play a role in national economic activities as soon as possible.

Since the Great Leap Forward last year, cargo loading and unloading work has been significantly improved and has achieved great results. For example, in the short nine months from August last year to May this year, the railway has increased the average daily number of loaded cars by 10,000, while the capacity provided by newly added freight cars during this period was only over 3,000. This shows that the improvement of railway transportation capacity mainly relies on tapping potential. The same is true for ports and docks. The labor productivity of loading and unloading workers in 28 major ports across the country increased by 17% in May this year compared with December last year.

However, due to the development of production and transportation, loading and unloading work cannot fully meet objective needs and has become a prominent weak link in the entire transportation process. The time vehicles and ships spend waiting for loading and unloading, and carrying out loading and unloading operations at stations, docks, and ports is still very long. For example, the time occupied by railway freight cars for loading and unloading operations is about one-third of the total transportation time of freight cars; the loading and unloading time of motor ships at docks or ports is equivalent to half of the total ship transportation time; the ratio of car travel time to stop time is one to two or one to three. This situation is extremely incompatible with the current busy situation on the transportation front, where the volume of traffic is increasing daily and transportation capacity is insufficient. In particular, with the continuous upsurge of the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy, the transportation tasks of various materials on the transportation front are trending to increase significantly, while transportation equipment such as vehicles and ships cannot be greatly increased in the short term. Therefore, to complete the increasingly heavy transportation tasks and transport more goods, we must start by accelerating the turnover of vehicles and ships. Further improving loading and unloading work, quick loading and unloading, and shortening the loading and unloading time as much as possible is one of the most effective measures to accelerate the turnover of vehicles and ships.

Loading and unloading work is a weak link in transportation work; and among loading and unloading work, unloading vehicles and ships, and the preparation work for loading and unloading, such as taking and delivering vehicles and ships berthing at docks, are the weakest links. At present, the unloading time generally exceeds the loading time by one time. Many large cities, key factories and mines, and ports are often backlogged with vehicles and ships waiting to be unloaded. Because the goods on the vehicles and ships cannot be unloaded in time, more empty vehicles and ships cannot be freed up to load more goods. Therefore, to do a good job in loading and unloading, we should currently focus on strengthening the unloading of vehicles and ships, shortening the waiting time for loading and unloading, and improving operations such as taking and delivering vehicles and ships berthing.

How can we achieve quick loading and unloading? One of the most effective ways is to strengthen coordination. The facts of the past few years have proved that wherever there is good coordination, the loading and unloading operation time is greatly shortened, and production efficiency and transportation efficiency are significantly improved. In particular, since the Great Leap Forward, many places have created a lot of experience in strengthening loading and unloading coordination. The cooperation between coal mines and railways has the experience of Fuxin, the cooperation between steel plants and railways has the experience of Benxi, and the cooperation between railways and ports has the experience of Qinhuangdao. The transportation departments and material consignment departments in these places are closely integrated on the basis of unified thinking, implementing unified leadership, unified dispatch and command, unified relations between production, transportation, and sales, etc., so that the stay time of vehicles in factories and mines is shortened by half in a very short period of time. Many large and medium-sized cities, under the unified leadership of the local transportation command, implement unified management and allocation of the city's loading, unloading and handling forces; some have also promoted the method of jointly using railway special lines by region, thus overcoming the phenomenon of uneven distribution of loading and unloading equipment and labor, improving loading and unloading efficiency, and alleviating the tension in urban handling work. In small and medium-sized stations and docks, many transportation departments and local people's communes have established cooperative relations, with the people's communes concurrently handling loading and unloading business, to adapt to the fluctuating and unpredictable needs of loading and unloading business in small and medium-sized stations and docks. Transportation departments should clarify the idea of ​​serving industrial and agricultural production and try to take care of the reasonable requirements of material consignment departments as much as possible. For example, when allocating vehicles and ships, they should be adapted to the goods being transported as much as possible. For coal and timber, open wagons should be allocated, and for goods that are afraid of moisture such as grain, salt, and cement, covered wagons should be allocated. And according to the loading and unloading capacity of factories and mines, the arrival time of vehicles and ships should be made as balanced as possible. Material consignment departments should also list loading and unloading work as their own production and business work, save vehicles and ships as much as possible, and actively take care of the difficulties of transportation departments, quick loading and unloading, and not use vehicles and ships as warehouses.

To improve loading and unloading efficiency and achieve quick loading and unloading, we must mobilize the masses, carry out a technical innovation movement, and realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading work. At present, the phenomenon of manual carrying in loading and unloading work is still relatively common, which is an important reason for the low loading and unloading efficiency. In recent years, many places have carried out the "three-ization" movement of chutes, derricks, and trolleys in loading and unloading work, which has greatly improved loading and unloading efficiency and saved a lot of labor. Since the Great Leap Forward, the creations of the masses in this regard have been even more diverse. The national railway has built 1,700 high platforms, extending 140 kilometers, and more than 1,000 low cargo positions, extending more than 230 kilometers, which greatly improved loading and unloading efficiency. For example, the gate-type two-sided landslide high platform of the Xuejia Quarry in Jinzhou only takes two minutes to load fifteen cars, increasing efficiency by 44 times. Many stations and ports have manufactured various kinds of indigenous and foreign-combined lifting derricks, conveyors, and handling trolleys, and many of them have basically realized "three-ization". These experiences should be well and universally promoted.

In carrying out the technical innovation movement of loading and unloading tools, it must be carried out in accordance with local conditions, according to the type of goods, and with leadership and planning. For example, the construction of high platforms and low cargo positions should take into account the terrain conditions, the types of goods, and the convenience of exchanging goods with various transportation tools, etc. It should not be mechanically copied, otherwise, it will be counterproductive and cause waste. The reform of loading and unloading tools should also pay attention to overcoming the one-sided view of being too big and too "foreign" without considering the needs and the possibility of manpower and material resources. Of course, we cannot be satisfied with earth machinery, but also gradually transform and improve it according to needs and possibilities. At the same time, where there are various kinds of earth and foreign machinery in the same station or dock, a reasonable division of labor should be organized according to the types of goods loaded and unloaded, and joint operations should be carried out to form an organic mechanized and semi-mechanized loading and unloading system to further improve loading and unloading efficiency.

Under possible conditions, it is also necessary to continuously increase modern large-scale loading and unloading machinery according to needs. This is especially necessary for large ports, large stations, and large factories and mines enterprises with particularly heavy business volume and rapid growth in transportation volume, as well as places where heavy machinery loading and unloading operations are carried out. In the past few years, the state has spent a lot of investment in this area, equipping these places with various types of loading and unloading machinery, and will continue to do so in the future. However, due to the limitations of China's machinery production capacity and raw material resources, it cannot fully meet the needs in the short term. This requires us to strengthen organizational management, mobilize the masses, and give full play to the potential of existing loading and unloading equipment.

At present, millions of workers on the transportation front are high-spirited and full of energy. The railway is vigorously carrying out the advance transportation movement, the shipping department is also striving to transport more goods, and automobile transportation has always been busy. The short-distance transportation front, which has fallen behind, will also have a massive mass movement. Thousands of boats are racing and tens of thousands of axles are rolling, and all these goods must be unloaded at the designated locations, and all these vehicles and ships must be loaded at the designated locations. Strengthening loading and unloading work is imperative. It is hoped that all transportation departments and material consignment departments will take immediate action under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels, and launch a mass movement of quick loading and unloading to adapt to the situation of continued leap forward on the entire transportation front and the entire national economic front!

    快装快卸
    货物装卸工作是整个运输过程中的一个重要环节。俗话说：“不怕慢，只怕站”。车、船的行驶速度慢了，固然不好；但停留时间太长，更会浪费大量运输力。因此，切实做好车站、码头、港口工作，快装快卸，对于加速车船的周转，提高运输效率，缩短物资的运送时间，使物资尽快地在国民经济活动中发生作用，具有重大意义。
    去年大跃进以来，货物的装卸工作已经有了显著的改进，获得了很大的成绩。例如铁路从去年8月至今年5月的短短九个月里，平均每天的装车数提高了一万辆，而在这期间新增加的货车所能提供的能力只有三千多辆。这说明铁路运输能力的提高，主要是依靠挖掘潜力。港口、码头也是如此，全国二十八个主要港口装卸工人的劳动生产率，今年5月份比去年12月份提高了17％。
    但是，由于生产和运输事业的发展，装卸工作还不能完全满足客观的需要，成为整个运输过程中突出的薄弱环节。车辆、船舶在车站、码头、港口等待装卸和进行装卸作业的时间仍然很长。例如，铁路货车进行装卸作业所占用的时间，约为货车整个运输时间的三分之一；机动船舶在码头或港口的装卸停留时间，相当于整个船舶运输时间的一半；汽车行驶时间和停留时间的比例是一比二至一比三，这种状况同当前运输战线上运量日增、运力不足的繁忙形势是极不相称的。特别是随着增产节约群众运动的不断高涨，运输战线上各种物资的运输任务都有大量增长的趋势，而车、船等运输设备不可能在短期内大量增加。因此，要完成日益繁重的运输任务，多装运货物，必须从加速车辆、船舶的周转着手。进一步改善装卸工作，快装快卸，把装卸时间压缩得短些再短些，这是加速车、船周转的最有效的措施之一。
    装卸工作是运输工作的薄弱环节；在装卸工作中又以卸车、卸船工作和装卸的准备工作如车辆取送、船舶停靠码头等环节最为薄弱。目前，卸车时间一般超过装车时间一倍。不少大城市、重点厂矿和港口都经常积压着待卸的车、船。由于不能及时把车上、船上的货物卸下来，也就不能腾出更多的空车和空船，装运更多的货物。因此，要做好装卸工作，当前更应该以加强卸车、卸船工作、缩短装卸等待时间，改善车辆取送、船舶靠岸等作业为重点。
    怎样才能做到快装快卸呢？最有效的办法之一是加强协作。几年来的事实证明，凡是协作好的，装卸作业时间就大大缩短，生产效率和运输效率也就显著提高。特别是大跃进以来，许多地方都在加强装卸协作方面创造了很多经验。煤矿和铁路的协作有阜新的经验，钢厂和铁路的协作有本溪的经验，铁路和港口的协作有秦皇岛的经验。这些地方的运输部门和物资托运部门都是在统一思想的基础上，密切结合起来，实行统一领导，统一调度指挥，统一产、运、销的关系等等，使车辆在厂矿的停留时间在很短时期内缩短了一半。许多大中城市，在当地运输指挥部的统一领导下，对全市的装卸搬运力量，实行统一管理与调配；有的还推行了按地区分片共同使用铁路专用线的办法，因而克服了装卸设备和劳力忙闲不均的现象，提高了装卸效率，缓和了市内搬运工作的紧张情况。在中、小车站和码头，许多运输部门和当地人民公社建立了协作关系，由人民公社兼办装卸业务，适应了中小车站、码头装卸业务量波动不定，忽大忽小的需要。运输部门要明确为工农业生产服务的思想，尽可能地照顾物资托运部门的合理要求。例如，在调配车辆和船舶的时候，应该尽可能同所装运的货物相适应，运煤和木材，应配送敞车，运粮食、盐、水泥等怕湿的货物，应配送棚车，并且应根据厂矿企业的装卸能力，尽可能地使车辆和船舶到达的时间比较均衡。物资托运部门也应该把装卸工作列为自己的生产业务工作，尽量节省车、船，并且主动地照顾运输部门的困难，快装快卸，不要把车船当仓库使用。
    提高装卸效率，做到快装快卸，必须发动群众，开展技术革新运动，实现装卸工作的机械化、半机械化。目前在装卸工作中，人力扛抬的现象还是比较普遍的，这是装卸效率不高的一个重要原因。近年来，许多地方在装卸工作中开展了滑道化、吊杆化、车子化的“三化”运动，大大提高了装卸效率，节省了大量劳动力。大跃进以来，各地群众在这方面的创造更是丰富多采。全国铁路已修成了高站台一千七百处，延长一百四十公里，低货位一千多处，延长二百三十多公里，大大提高了装卸效率。例如锦州薛家采石场的闸门式两面滑坡高站台，装十五个车只需二分钟，提高效率四十四倍。很多车站和港口制造了各种各样土洋结合的起重吊杆、输送机和搬运小车，其中有不少单位已基本上实现了“三化”。这些经验应该很好地普遍推广。
    在开展装卸工具技术革新运动中，必须因地制宜，因货制宜，有领导有计划地进行。例如修建高站台、低货位，应该考虑到地形条件，货物种类，各种运输工具换装货物的便利等等条件，不能机械搬用，否则，事倍功半，反而造成浪费。装卸工具的改革，还应该注意克服那种不根据需要与人力、物力的可能，好大、好“洋”的片面观点。当然，我们也不能满足于土机械，还要根据需要与可能，逐步地改造提高。同时，凡在同一个车站、码头上，土洋各种机械都有的，应该根据装卸货物的种类组织合理分工，联合作业，构成一个有机的机械化、半机械化的装卸系统，把装卸效率再提高一步。
    在可能的条件下，根据需要不断地增加现代化的大型装卸机械，也是必要的。尤其是对于那些业务量特别繁重，运输量增长很快的大港、大站、大厂矿企业，以及进行重型机械装卸作业的场所，更为必要。几年来，国家在这方面已经花了不少投资，为这些地方装备了各种各样的装卸机械，并且今后还将继续这样做。但是由于我国机械生产能力和原材料资源的限制，短期内还不能完全满足需要。这就需要我们加强组织管理工作，发动群众，充分发挥现有装卸设备的潜力。
    目前，运输战线上千百万职工意气风发，干劲十足。铁路上正在大力开展提前运输运动，航运部门也在力争运送更多的货物，汽车运输一直是繁忙的，落在后面的短途运输战线也将有一个声势浩大的群众运动。千舟竞发、万轴滚滚，所有这些货物都要在既定的地点卸下来，所有这些车辆船舶也都要在既定的地点装载。装卸工作的加强是刻不容缓的。希望各个运输部门和物资托运部门在各级党委的统一领导下立即行动起来，开展一个快装快卸的群众运动，来适应整个运输战线和整个国民经济战线继续跃进的形势！
