    In Praise of the "Manage the Sky Group"
    Ji Zhongren
    Some members of the Changhou Commune in Nanxian County, Hunan Province, with the help of the meteorological station, have established many "weather outposts," which they call "Manage the Sky Groups." They observe the weather every day and help the commune arrange production. In the People's Daily on August 13th, a photo was published showing an old farmer wearing a straw hat, pointing to the sky with one finger, as if telling a young man something, and the young man listening with a smile, as if taking notes. This is probably the "Manage the Sky Group" managing the sky.

    Managing the sky is a part of humanity's struggle against nature. In the past, humanity's struggle with nature was mostly about managing the land, the mountains, and the water. Because the sky was too high to reach, people managed it less, but they gradually started to manage it; now, humanity still cannot make the wind and rain as myths say, but it can rely on scientific knowledge and equipment to grasp the changes in the weather, and try to use wind and rain to serve humanity. The more developed science is, the more and more strictly people will manage the sky. As for the sky management of the members of the Changhou Commune, it is certainly simpler, and is only based on the experience of the old farmers to collect the changes shown by the celestial phenomena to help people fight against "heaven."

    However, this kind of sky management thinking is extremely valuable.

    People rely on conquering the land for food, but the sky often acts on the earth. Wind, rain, cold, and warmth all affect the growth of crops. Therefore, people have to fight against the sky. For example, if it does not rain, the land will be dry; at present, people cannot force the sky to rain, but they can find ways to use surface or underground water to prevent and combat drought. If there is heavy rain or torrential rain, the crops will be flooded; at present, people cannot force the sky not to rain, but people can find ways to store floodwater and drain water to prevent flooding. This effect of people on the land, which outweighs the effect of the sky, is called defeating the sky. From the perspective of continuous struggle, the power of the people is infinite, so we have the belief that "man will definitely conquer nature."

    In the process of humanity's struggle with the sky for "leadership" over the land, two kinds of thoughts about the sky will arise. One is the idea of managing the sky. Although the ability to manage the sky varies, and the scope of sky management varies, people always adhere to the struggle against the sky, and they believe that human power can turn the tide. "Man will definitely conquer nature" is their unwavering belief. They have won victories in the struggle and have written and are writing many heroic epics with their actions. Especially today, and especially at present, when we open the newspaper, we can see how many records of such heroic deeds; when we turn on the radio, we can hear how many voices praising these heroic behaviors. These hundreds of millions of people also include those people in the sky management group of the Changhou Commune.

    The other is the idea of relying on the sky. These people are too superstitious about the sky, thinking that whether to plant or not is up to people, and whether to harvest or not is up to the sky. Before there is drought or flood, these people have the idea of relying on the sky for rain or praying for good weather. Once there is drought or flood, they will have pessimistic and disappointed emotions. In short, they lack confidence in their own strength and let the sky dictate everything. Before the people were completely liberated, when people's ability to fight against the sky was still very small and scattered, it was inevitable to produce this idea of relying on the sky. Today, this idea of relying on the sky has been greatly weakened among the people, but it has not been completely eliminated, so people in various places must constantly fight against this idea of relying on the sky in the earth-shattering drought relief movement, so that all people can be better armed with the idea of managing the sky.

    People will surely defeat the sky, and the idea of managing the sky will surely completely defeat the idea of relying on the sky. May those who have the idea of relying on the sky also recognize the great collective power of the people under the leadership of the Party, and quickly establish the idea of managing the sky!

    “管天小组”赞
    冀仲仁
    湖南省南县长厚公社的一些社员，在气象站帮助下成立了很多个“气象哨”，他们自己称之为“管天小组”。他们每天都要观察天气，帮助社里安排生产。8月13日的人民日报上，登了一张有关的照片，一个带草帽的老农民，用一只手指着天空，像是对旁边一个青年讲说什么，那个青年含笑地听着，仿佛还在记录。这大概就是“管天小组”正在管天吧。
    管天，是人类同自然斗争的一个部分。人类同自然作斗争，以前大多是管地、管山、管水，由于天高莫及，人们管的还比较少，但也逐渐管起来了；现在，人类自然还不能像神话所说的那样呼风唤雨，但却可以依靠科学知识和器械的帮助，来掌握天气的变化，并设法利用风雨等来为人类服务。科学愈发达，人们对天管的就会越多，越严。至于长厚公社社员们的管天，当然更简单一些，还只不过是凭了老农的经验，把天象显示的变化收集起来，帮助人们同“天”作斗争。
    但是，这种管天的思想，却是极可贵的。
    人靠了征服土地来吃饭，但天却常常要施作用于大地。风、雨、冷、暖，莫不影响庄稼的生长。于是人们便不得不来同天作斗争，比如说，天不下雨地便要旱；目前人不能硬要天下雨，但是人可以设法利用地面上的或地下的水来防旱、抗旱。天要下大雨、暴雨，庄稼要涝；目前人不能硬要天不下雨，但是，人可以设法蓄洪、排水，不使它涝。人对地的这种作用，大过了天的作用，就叫作战胜了天。从持续不断地斗争来看，人民的力量是无穷的，所以我们才有“人定胜天”的信念。
    人类在同天争夺对地的“领导权”的过程中，对天会产生两种思想。一种就是管天思想。尽管管天的能力有大有小，对天管的范围有广有狭，但人们始终都坚持对天的斗争，他们认为人力可以回天。“人定胜天”是他们始终不渝的信念。他们在斗争中节节取得胜利，用自己的行动，写下了和正在写着许多壮烈的史诗。尤其在今天，更尤其在目前，打开报纸来，我们能看到多少关于这种英雄事迹的记载；拧开收音机，我们能听到多少关于这些英雄行为赞颂的声音。在这数以亿计的人中也就包括有长厚公社管天小组的那些人们。
    另一种就是靠天思想。这种人对天过于迷信，以为种不种在人，收不收在天。这种人在没有旱、涝之前，有靠天下雨或求天风调雨顺的思想，一等有了旱、涝，便会产生悲观失望的情绪。总之是对自己的力量缺乏自信，却一味的让天摆布。在人民彻底翻身以前，当人们同天斗争的能力还很微小、很分散的时候，产生这种靠天思想，原也是不可避免的。今天，在人们当中这种靠天思想已经大大减弱了，但是却还没有完全消灭，所以各地人民在惊天动地的抗旱救灾运动中，还要不时地同这种靠天思想作斗争。以便使所有的人用管天思想更好的武装起来。
    人一定会战胜天，管天思想也一定会完全战胜靠天思想。但愿那些有靠天思想的人，也能认识在党的领导下人的伟大集体力量，赶快树立起管天思想来！
