	Ink Wash Splashes, Lifelike
	--A Visit to the Rong Bao Zhai Woodblock Printing Shop
	By Our Reporter Bai Sheng
	Recently, I had the opportunity to visit the famous woodblock printing shop "Rong Bao Zhai" on the ancient cultural street of Liulichang, outside Hepingmen in the capital. Stepping into the glass doors of Rong Bao Zhai, which bears the inscription by Guo Moruo, one immediately feels a sense of antiquity. The several large storefronts are decorated and furnished with great elegance. The walls are filled with colorful and exquisitely mounted original Chinese paintings, and woodblock prints so exquisite that they are lifelike and almost indistinguishable from the original works of the artists. Several exceptionally clean large glass cabinets display various painting albums, poetry stationery, and cultural artifacts. These unique national art pieces radiate an extraordinary brilliance.
	Look! In those modern Chinese paintings, Qi Baishi's insects, birds, flowers, and plants are so full of ink wash, vivid in color, and lifelike. Those butterflies, dragonflies, cicadas, and mantises, seemingly flying and leaping, are all active on the paper. The fine hairs on the insects' bodies and their transparent wings seem to tremble gently. These insects, vividly depicted by the artist, evoke memories of the infinite joy of catching insects with childhood friends. And our woodblock printing workers have expressed the artist's vivid works with such remarkable fidelity.
	Xu Beihong's "Running Horse" is even more unrestrained in its brushstrokes, bold in its spirit, and full of vitality and infectiousness. On a huge vertical scroll is painted Xu Beihong's ink painting masterpiece "Cormorant Fishing." A group of cormorants, leisurely perched on the lakeside, and the few reeds appearing on the screen, especially show the vast lake scenery. This is Rong Bao Zhai's newly completed large-scale woodblock printing work.
	Among the classical paintings of past dynasties, the "Literary Gathering" by Han Huang, a famous painter of the Tang Dynasty, attracts people to a realm full of poetic sentiment. This painting depicts the scene of four poets conceiving ideas and composing poems under an ancient pine tree, vividly expressing the inner emotions of the poets and the various expressions of their thoughts. The delicate portrayal of the characters' expressions is particularly captivating. Only those who have seriously studied and understood the poetic artistic conception of the original painting can carve and print such a lifelike work that closely resembles the original. Another painting with a similar artistic conception is "Literary Meeting" by Tang Bohu, an outstanding painter of the Ming Dynasty. The inner emotions of the characters when discussing literature and composing poems are also depicted extremely vividly and realistically.
	A painting by Zhao Ziang, a famous painter of the Yuan Dynasty, "Autumn Outing with Horses," which Rong Bao Zhai has just completed, is displayed before my eyes. On the silk, which seems already ancient, appears a moving scene in the beautiful autumn scenery, where a horseman riding a steed drives a group of horses to the riverbank outside the city to drink water, as well as the different colors of the ten horses, and their various expressions and postures in the gallop, are very realistically reflected on the screen. The exquisite carving and printing of this woodblock printing make you think you are admiring Zhao Ziang's original work from hundreds of years ago.
	In addition, there is "Court Ladies with Flowers in Their Hair" by Zhou Fang, a great painter of the Tang Dynasty, which vividly depicts the plump figures of noble Tang women wearing gauze and silk, holding flowers in their hands, and rejoicing, appearing vividly on the silk that is already old and yellowed; "Autumn Window Reading the Book of Changes" by Liu Songnian, a painter of the Southern Song Dynasty, depicts the scene of Song Dynasty scholars diligently studying by the window in the beautiful autumn scenery, and is so natural and vivid; "Journey Among Rivers and Mountains" by Qiu Ying, a great painter of the Ming Dynasty, not only paints the reluctant parting mood of sending friends away, but even the patch of green grass on the screen that is lying low with the wind seems to be revived; The "Orchids and Bamboo" by Zheng Banqiao, a painter of the Qing Dynasty, has a unique style and is inscribed with the poet's own verses. Although there are only a few strokes on the screen, the orchid with its green belt welcoming the wind, and the proud and upright posture of the bamboo branches, are all reflected in the rich and light ink intention.
	These many woodblock printed reproductions of famous paintings are so realistic that they resemble original works from the hands of the artists. Some even seem to ripple with moisture, and the ink is not yet dry. It is really difficult to distinguish for a while whether they were painted by the artists on paper or silk, or whether they are the creation of the highly printing art of the Rong Bao Zhai woodblock printing workers.
	There are too many works to appreciate. There are also ancient beautiful lacquerware patterns, Dunhuang murals, Yongle Palace murals, as well as classical paintings from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, and modern Chinese paintings. In many exquisitely decorated and antique albums, I also saw the flower and bird painting albums of Ren Bonian, a great painter of the Qing Dynasty, Shen Shitian's "Lying and Traveling Album" of Ming Dynasty painter, Wu Changshuo's painting album, the old man Baishi's ink drawings and grass and insect album, as well as selected prints from past dynasties and Rong Bao Zhai's poetry stationery, etc. These many albums and poetry stationery, each with different styles and artistic conceptions, collect the representative works of various artists. The more one looks at them, the more one cannot bear to put them down.
	The process of reproducing these works of art is such an extraordinary artistic creation process! It requires the collective creation of color ink painters and engraving and printing workers. In the factory attached to Rong Bao Zhai, I saw with excitement and joy the meticulous drawing and copying and color separation of the painters, as well as the fine engraving of the carving workers holding knives like pens, and the ingenious production of the printing workers wielding brushes and dyeing like painters wielding brushes. On the walls of the engraving workshop, I also saw the painting creations of these workers who have artistic accomplishments in painting. How much they love their careers!
	Rong Bao Zhai's woodblock prints have such a unique style; Rong Bao Zhai, which produces these works of art, has experienced many vicissitudes. This shop, founded sixty years ago in the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, was initially just a small paper shop. It was famous for printing colored stationery and had a simple printing workshop attached to it. In the history of woodcut prints that began in the Tang Dynasty, it went through a long period of suffering and hardship. During the Kuomintang rule, it almost closed down in its dying days. At that time, the printing workers lived a miserable and hard life. It was not until today, after the liberation of Beijing, that it radiated its brilliant artistic light under the attention and support of the Party and the People's Government. Now, Rong Bao Zhai's woodblock prints frequently appear at international cultural and art exhibitions held in various countries. In order to promote this treasure of national art, and help the carving and printing workers of Rong Bao Zhai improve the artistic level of woodblock prints, the Party not only cares very much about the lives of the workers, but also arranges time for them to study their profession and invites painters to give them painting lessons. Recently, the painters and carving and printing workers of Rong Bao Zhai are busy meticulously producing a batch of new works, including Chairman Mao's poem manuscripts and illustrations, Guo Moruo's Hundred Flowers poem manuscripts and illustrations, as well as the classic painting "The Night Revels of Han Xizai" by Gu Hongzhong of the Five Dynasties, which is a huge undertaking and has begun to be produced.

    水墨淋漓  维妙维肖
    ——访问荣宝斋木版水印画店
    本报记者　柏生
    最近，我有机会到首都和平门外那条古老的文化街——琉璃厂，去访问著名的木版水印画店“荣宝斋”。一走进那挂着郭沫若题字匾额的荣宝斋的玻璃大门，立刻给人一种古色古香的感觉。几间宽大的门面里，布置陈设得十分典雅。墙壁上满满地悬挂着彩墨淋漓、装璜精致的国画原作，和精湛得与画家原作维妙维肖、几乎毫无区别的木版水印画。几个异常明净的大玻璃柜中，陈列着各种画册、诗笺和文玩。那一幅幅独具风格的民族艺术品，放射出异样的光采。
    你看！那现代国画中，齐白石的虫鸟花卉，是那般水墨淋漓，色彩鲜明，栩栩如生。那些仿佛飞动跳跃着的蝴蝶、蜻蜓、蝉和螳螂，都一一活跃在纸上。昆虫身上的绒毛和透明的羽翼也仿佛在轻轻颤动。这些出现在画家笔下跃跃欲动的昆虫，引起你回忆童年时代和小伙伴们一起捉虫时的无限欢乐情景。而我们的木版水印工人们更是那样传神地表达了画家的生动作品。
    徐悲鸿的“奔马”，更是那样笔墨奔放，气魄豪迈，富有生命力和感染力。一幅巨大的立轴上，绘着徐悲鸿的水墨画杰作“鱼鹰图”。一群鱼鹰，悠闲自得地栖息在湖边的生动姿态，和画面上出现的淡淡的几株芦苇，格外显示出浩淼的湖畔景色。这是荣宝斋新近完成的巨幅木版水印画作品。
    在历代古典绘画中，唐代名画家韩滉的“文苑图”，把人们吸引到一番极富诗意的境界中。这幅描绘四个诗人在一棵古松树下构思联吟赋诗情景的画幅，生动地表达了诗人们的内心情感和构思的各种神气。人物表情的细致，分外引人入胜。要不是曾经认真研究和体会了原画构图的诗意画境的人，是很难刻印出这样维妙维肖酷似原画真迹般的作品来。另一幅和这幅画意境差不多的是明代杰出画家唐伯虎的“文会图”，画中人物谈文对吟时的内心情感，也描绘得极其生动真切。
    展示在我眼前的一幅元代名画家赵子昂的“秋郊饮马”图，是荣宝斋刚刚完成的一幅新作。在那仿佛已经古旧了的绢帛上，出现的那一幅在秋天美妙的景色中，一个牧马人骑着一匹骏马，驰赶着一群马奔往郊外河边饮水的动人情景，以及那十匹马的不同色彩，和奔驰中各个不同的神情和体态，都非常逼真地体现在画面上。这幅木版水印画的刻工和印工的精细，使你以为欣赏的正是数百年前赵子昂的真迹原作。
    此外那唐代大画师周昉的“簪花仕女图”，描绘的那体态丰盈，身着纱罗，手中拈花喜乐的唐代贵族妇女的生动形象，跃然在那已经古旧发黄的绢帛上；南宋画家刘松年描绘的那幅宋代学者在美丽的秋色中临窗伏案勤读情景的“秋窗读易图”，是那般自然生动；明代大画家仇英的“江间行旅图”，不但画出了送友远行的依依离别情调，就连那画面上的一片随风低偃的青草，也仿佛要复活起来；那别有一番风格的清代画家郑板桥的那幅题有诗人自己诗句的“兰竹图”，虽然画面上仅寥寥数笔，但那翠带迎风的兰花，和傲然劲挺的竹枝的风姿，就都体现在那浓淡一挥的墨意中了。
    这许许多多名画的木版水印复制品，竟然都逼真得宛如一幅幅出自画家手笔的原作。有的甚至看来还仿佛水意荡漾，墨气未干。真使你一时难以分清究竟是画家画在纸、绢上的，还是出自荣宝斋木版水印工人的高度印刷艺术的创造。
    要欣赏的作品真是太多了。这里还有古代美丽的漆器图案画、敦煌壁画、永乐宫壁画，以及唐、宋、元、明、清历代古典绘画和现代国画。在许多装璜精致古雅的画册中，我还看到了清朝大画家任伯年的花鸟画册，明代画家沈石田“卧游册”，近人吴昌硕画册，白石老人墨玅和草虫册，以及历代版画选和荣宝斋诗笺等等。这许多各具不同风格和意境的画册、诗笺，收集了各家的代表作品。真使人愈看愈不能释手。
    复制这些艺术品的过程，是一个多么不平凡的艺术创造过程啊！它需要彩墨画家同刻版、水印工人的精心合力的集体创作。在荣宝斋附设的工厂里，我满怀着兴奋和喜悦的心情，看到了画师们一笔一划的精心勾描临摹和分色，也看到了那持刀如笔的雕刻工人的精细的刻版，更看到了那挥刷染色宛如画家运笔的印刷工人的巧妙制作。在刻版车间的墙壁上，我还看到了这些具有绘画艺术修养的工人自己的绘画创作，他们是多么热爱着自己的事业啊！
    荣宝斋的木版水印画艺术作品是那样别具风格；制作这些艺术品的荣宝斋是曾经历尽沧桑的。这个创设在距今六十年前清朝光绪年间的店铺，最初只是一家小小的南纸店。它以彩印信笺闻名，并自己附设了一个简陋的印刷作坊。在继承我国自唐代就开始兴起的木刻版画历史中，它经过了漫长的一段风雨飘摇的苦难岁月。国民党统治时代，它曾在奄奄一息中几乎关了门。那时印刷工人过着悲惨困苦的生活。直到北京解放后的今天，才在党和人民政府的重视和支持下，放射出它的灿烂的艺术光芒。现在，荣宝斋的木版水印画，经常出现在各国举办的国际文化艺术展览会上。党为了发扬这枝民族艺术的奇葩，帮助荣宝斋的刻印工人们提高木版水印画的艺术水平，不但十分关怀着工人们的生活，还为他们安排了业务学习的时间，请画家给他们讲授绘画课。最近荣宝斋的画家和刻印工人们正忙着精心制作一批新作品，其中如毛主席诗词手稿和插图，郭沫若的百花诗手稿和插图，还有耗工巨大的古典名画五代顾宏中的“韩熙载夜宴图”等，都已开始在制作。（附图片）
