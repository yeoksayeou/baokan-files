　　Seize Back the Vegetables "Heaven" Took Away
　　Suburban Beijing Resists Floods and Hastens Autumn Vegetable Planting
    This newspaper reports that a struggle to fight the flood and seize a harvest from the land is underway in suburban Beijing. As of the 10th, the people of the city and countryside have worked together and fought bravely, draining more than 1.3 million mu of farmland. The remaining nearly 1 million mu of flooded land is also being drained in a concentrated effort. In the near suburbs, except for a few particularly low-lying areas, the water in the vegetable fields has basically receded. On the dry land that has just been exposed after the water receded, vegetable farmers have already sown more than 230,000 mu of various autumn vegetables, accounting for more than half of the planned planting area. Among them, the planting of Chinese cabbage for consumption this winter and next spring has been completed by a quarter of the planned target.
    Currently, the urban and rural people fighting in the disaster areas are dividing into three groups, taking advantage of the sunny weather to engage in a major battle. While rushing to drain water, they are also rushing to plant and strengthen field management.
    In the drainage battle, district (county) and commune leaders and experienced farmers are working together to survey the terrain, plan waterways, and make full use of the favorable conditions of the people's communes to make overall arrangements. Therefore, drainage is progressing rapidly. The Liangxiang Commune mobilized more than 5,000 people to dig more than 850 large and small drainage ditches in three days, dewatering 90% of the flooded crops. The Mulin Commune in Shunyi County cooperated closely with a nearby commune in Miyun County to dig a 700-meter drainage canal, preventing serious water damage to 2,000 mu of land in the Mafang Management Area of the commune, which had been flooded for years.
    On the land that has been drained, the autumn vegetable planting work is proceeding immediately and intensively. Vegetable fields that have been washed away several times have been replanted in a timely manner after the rain. The Chinese cabbage in the Beiding Production Team of the Chaoyang Commune has been planted and washed away three times, and after the autumn water receded, the fourth planting began. There is still water in the vegetable fields of the Wangezhuang Production Team of the Xinghuo Commune, and the members are scooping mud from the water to stack it into ridges, and sowing seeds on the high ridges. According to Beijing's climate conditions, there are only two or three days left for sowing Chinese cabbage. Time is very tight. Vegetable farmers are seizing the time to overcome numerous difficulties and strive to complete the autumn vegetable planting task in order to ensure the supply of vegetables for six months this winter and next spring. Now, on the dry land where the flood has receded, the production teams have directly sown seeds. In the low-lying areas where the water has not been completely drained, vegetable farmers are rushing to plant a large number of cabbage seedlings on the dry land on high ground, courtyards, and in front of and behind houses, preparing to transplant them as soon as the water recedes. The Sijiqing People's Commune in Haidian District, which mainly grows vegetables, formed a 10,000-person planting "corps," and by the 11th, all 11,000 mu of directly sown cabbage had been planted, and they are now expanding the planting area and continuing to rush to plant. The three people's communes in Changping District, Yanqing County, and Haidian District have also completed their autumn vegetable planting plans. The vast majority of mature vegetables in the flooded vegetable fields have been harvested and put on the market. In order to reduce the impact on the vegetable supply in September, various places are also rushing to plant fast-maturing vegetables that mature in 30 days. The Yuyuantan Commune has intercropped 240 mu of small rapeseed and bok choy in the Chinese cabbage fields. The Huangtugang Brigade of the Huangtugang Commune has adopted the method of intercropping, multiple cropping, and using the edges of the fields, ditch sides, and field ridges to grow vegetables, which can grow an additional 1,200 mu of vegetables. All districts are watering, topdressing, and striving to harvest more and earlier vegetables that are less affected by the disaster and are growing. (Wang Zhao Yue) (Attached pictures)

### 要把“老天”抢去的蔬菜夺回来　北京郊区抗涝抢种秋菜

　　要把“老天”抢去的蔬菜夺回来
　　北京郊区抗涝抢种秋菜
    本报讯　一场与天争收向地要菜的抗涝斗争正在北京郊区进行。截至10日，城乡人民协力奋战，已经排除农田积水一百三十多万亩，其余近百万亩土地的积水也正在突击抢排。近郊区除少数特别低洼的土地以外，菜田积水基本泄完，菜农们在这些水落后刚刚露出的干地上，已经播种了各种秋菜二十三万多亩，占计划播种面积的一半以上。其中供今冬明春食用的大白菜已完成播种计划四分之一。
    目前，战斗在灾区的城乡人民正兵分三路，趁晴大战，在突击排水的同时，一面抢种，一面加强田间管理。
    在排水战斗中，区（县）公社领导干部和有经验的农民一起勘察地形，规划水路，并且充分运用人民公社的有利条件，统筹安排。因此，排水进展迅速。良乡公社出动五千多人三天挖成大小泄水沟八百五十多条，使90％被淹的庄稼脱水。顺义木林公社与附近密云县的公社通力合作，挖了一条七百米的排水渠，使这个公社马坊管理区两千亩历年被淹的土地没有受到严重水害。
    在排除了积水的土地上秋菜播种工作立即紧张进行。被水冲毁几次的菜田，雨后又都及时抢种。朝阳公社北淀生产队的大白菜已三种三冲，秋水排除后又开始第四次播种。星火公社万各庄生产队的菜田里还有积水，社员们从水中捞泥叠成畦，在高畦上撒播种籽。按照北京的气候条件，播种白菜的时间只有两三天了。时间十分紧迫。菜农们抓紧时机，战胜重重困难，力争完成秋菜播种任务，以保证今冬明春六个月的蔬菜供应。现在，在洪水已退的干燥土地上，各生产队已直接播种。在积水还未全部排除的低洼地区，菜农们就抢先在高岗、场院和房前房后的干地上，秧上了大批白菜苗，准备在水退后立即移苗栽种。以种菜为主的海淀区四季青人民公社组成万人播种“兵团”，到11日，一万一千亩直播白菜已全部播完，现在还在扩大播种面积，继续抢种。昌平区、延庆县和海淀区的三个人民公社，也先后完成了秋菜播种计划。被水淹没的菜田，绝大部分已经把成熟蔬菜抢收上市，为了减少对9月份蔬菜供应的影响，各地还在抢种三十天成熟的快熟蔬菜。玉渊潭公社已经在大白菜田里间作了二百四十亩小油菜和小白菜。黄土岗公社黄土岗大队采取间作、套作、利用地沿地边、沟边、地埂种菜的办法，可以多种一千二百亩菜。各区对受灾较轻、正在生长的蔬菜，已经在浇清水、多追肥，争取多收早收。　（王昭钺）（附图片）
