Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 17th. Major General Ha Van Lau, head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, in a letter to the International Commission for Vietnam on August 13th, strongly protested against the South Vietnamese authorities, with the participation of American military advisors, for carrying out a "sweep" in the western part of South Vietnam, unprecedented in scale, duration, and brutality.

The letter, announced by the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army at a press conference this afternoon, pointed out that at the end of 1958, the South Vietnamese authorities mobilized more than 15,000 regular troops to conduct "sweeps" in the vast areas of the provinces of Kim Mau, Can Tho, Soc Trang, Bac Lieu, Rach Gia, and Tra Vinh, where the vast majority of the people had participated in the resistance war.

The letter said that, according to preliminary statistics, in addition to the loss of property and crops, the local people suffered 257 deaths, 508 injuries, and 3,250 arrests during the "sweep." This "sweep" has lasted for more than half a year and is still ongoing.

Ha Van Lau solemnly accused the South Vietnamese authorities of their brutal acts in this "sweep" in the letter. He cited the example that on May 26th and 27th, 36 people were killed in Long My district, their bodies were cut into pieces, and their heads were stuck on rafts made of banana stalks, and then these rafts were placed on the river to float as a public display. After the South Vietnamese authorities' "commandoes" captured people, they subjected them to electric shocks, or had them bitten to death by wolves, or even cut off the ears of living people, roasted them, and used them as a side dish with wine, before killing them. Tran Phuc Lam, a former communications officer of the village resistance administrative committee in Kim Mau province, Ho Van Thanh, a former member of the National Salvation Youth League, and Chau Van Lien, a former guerrilla, were brutally executed in this way. At the beginning of July this year, the South Vietnamese authorities' special military tribunal delegation openly declared in the south that many people would be beheaded.

Ha Van Lau pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities' acts of wantonly arresting and killing patriotic South Vietnamese people in accordance with the orders of American imperialism seriously violated the Geneva Accords. Ha Van Lau requested the International Commission to immediately send a mobile team to the western part of South Vietnam, especially the provinces of Kim Mau, Can Tho, and Soc Trang, to conduct an investigation, force the South Vietnamese authorities to abandon their policy of persecuting patriots and former resistance personnel, and, in accordance with the requirements put forward by General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, in his letter to the International Commission on March 6th this year, to guarantee the democratic and free rights of these people.

### 越南人民军代表团函越南国际委员会　抗议南越当局发动惨无人道的“扫荡”

　　越南人民军代表团函越南国际委员会
　　抗议南越当局发动惨无人道的“扫荡”
    据新华社河内17日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼大校在8月13日写给越南国际委员会的一封信中，强烈抗议南越当局在美国军事顾问的参与下，在南越南部西面进行了规模之大、时间之长和残暴程度都是空前的“扫荡”。
    越南人民军总司令部在今天下午举行的记者招待会上宣布的这封信件指出，在1958年底，南越当局曾经调动了一万五千多名正规部队，到金瓯、芹苴、朔庄、薄寮、迪石、茶荣等省广大地区进行“扫荡”，这些地区的人民绝大多数都参加过抗战。
    信中说，据初步统计，在“扫荡”中，当地人民除了遭到财产、庄稼的损失以外，还有二百五十七人死亡，五百零八人受伤，三千二百五十人被捕。这次“扫荡”已经持续了半年多，目前仍在继续进行。
    何文楼在信中严正控诉了南越当局在这次“扫荡”中的残暴行为。他举例说，5月26和27日，隆美县有三十六人被杀害，他们的尸体被砍成几段，头颅被插在芭蕉杆做的筏子上，然后把这些筏子放在河面上飘流示众。南越当局的“别动队”抓到人以后，就对他们施以电刑，或放狼狗咬死，甚至先割下活人的耳朵烤熟了下酒，然后才把他们杀死。金瓯省的前乡抗战行政委员会交通员陈福林、前救国青年团员胡文清和前游击队员周文连等就是被他们这样残暴地处死的。今年7月初，南越当局的特别军事法庭代表团还在南部公然宣称，将有许多人人头落地。
    何文楼指出，南越当局遵从美帝国主义的命令，大肆逮捕和杀害南越爱国人民的行为严重地破坏了日内瓦协议。何文楼要求国际委员会立即派出机动小组到南越南部西面，首先是金瓯、芹苴、朔庄等省进行调查，迫使南越当局放弃迫害爱国者和前抗战人员的政策，并且按照越南人民军总司令武元甲大将在今年3月6日写给国际委员会的信中提出的要求，保障这些人的民主自由权利。
