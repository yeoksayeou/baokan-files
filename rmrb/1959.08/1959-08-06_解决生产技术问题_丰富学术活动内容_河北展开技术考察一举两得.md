Hebei Province Unfolds Technical Inspection with Double Benefits: Solving Production Technology Problems and Enriching Academic Activities

    (Our report) From March to the present, the Hebei Provincial Science and Technology Association and the Hebei Academy of Agricultural Sciences and other units have continuously organized technical inspection work, which has not only solved many practical production technology problems, but also enriched the content of academic activities.

    In March, the Hebei Science and Technology Department invited experts from Hebei Agricultural University, Beijing Agricultural University, Baoding Agricultural College, and relevant regions and agricultural research institutes to form a wheat technology inspection team. They went to Handan, Tianjin, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and Tangshan prefectures to inspect 106 wheat fields in fifteen people's communes.

    Under the leadership and support of the local Party and government, and with the assistance of agricultural production leading departments and the masses, the inspection team combined key investigation with large-scale observation, conducted field experiments, analyzed and collected data, and concentrated opinions from all parties, basically clarifying the situation, analyzing the problems, researching the measures, and achieving the expected goals.

    The most important achievement of the inspection team was that, by combining leading cadres, scientific and technical personnel, and farmers, and adopting the method of "investigating, observing, measuring, calculating, and questioning," it was clarified that fertilization before wheat jointing and high soil fertility are the main factors directly contributing to more and larger wheat ears; spring irrigation and soil moisture directly affect the growth and development of wheat; and light conditions are also important factors for the normal growth and development of wheat seedlings. In addition, the relationship between fertilization and irrigation, which determine nutritional status, and light conditions and sowing density was also clarified. After the inspection team clarified these laws, it proposed technical measures to timely and reasonably apply various different fertilizers, supply water at the right time, and prevent lodging. These technical measures played a great role in promoting wheat to pass the "ear gate" and "grain gate" and ensuring a large-scale bumper harvest.

    Such inspection activities were welcomed by all parties. Party committees at all levels believe that this is a new way for scientific and technological activities to serve the production of the time and place. When the inspection team arrived in various counties, the county party committee introduced the situation to the inspection team, sent people to guide the inspection team to the people's communes to inspect, helped the inspection team select representative wheat fields of different types, and found experienced farmers to introduce the local situation and introduce experiences, etc. The inspection method of on-site testing and on-the-spot analysis attracted the interest of farmers in learning scientific knowledge. Commune cadres, members, and agricultural technicians actively conducted relevant tests and analyses with the inspection team. Wherever the inspection team went, the masses of farmers generally felt that they had gained in agricultural scientific knowledge. Xiaobeiwang People's Commune in Yongnian County took the soil drill used by the inspection team to check the soil and asked the blacksmith to make copies. Another people's commune in the county, seeing that the method of using a soil quick-testing box to test soil fertility and moisture content was very good, immediately sent someone to purchase a soil quick-testing box to apply it.

    Now, various prefectures, cities, and counties in Hebei Province, as well as many scientific and technological departments, have also generally adopted the method of technical inspection to further activate mass scientific and technological activities to promote a greater leap forward in production. The Hebei Provincial Agricultural Society and the Aquatic Products Bureau jointly organized a coastal fishing technology inspection to improve fish and shrimp catching technology and ensure the completion of the fishing task. The Hebei Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Geography, and the Department of Geography of Shijiazhuang Normal College also jointly organized a comprehensive inspection team of the Hebei River Basin to systematically inspect the natural and economic status of Hebei, solve the problem of soil and water conservation in the river basin, and prepare to put forward the direction of future economic development.

    Recently, the Hebei Provincial Science and Technology Association and other units, through the summary of the technical inspection activities in the previous period, believe that there are several benefits to doing so: First, technical inspection is a good form to promote the close integration of mass scientific and technological activities with the production practice of the time and place. Therefore, it not only helps to solve major scientific and technological problems in the production of the time and place, but also drives scientific and technological research. Second, it can promote the combination of intellectuals with workers and peasants. Third, technical inspection promotes cooperation between various parties and opens up a new way for carrying out comprehensive scientific research activities. Some major scientific and technological problems are difficult to solve by relying on one department alone, and cooperation must be strengthened. It can be solved through the jointly organized technical inspection team. Fourth, technical inspection is a good form of academic activity. Through technical inspection, a large amount of data can be collected to enrich the content of academic activities and make academic activities based on mastering practical data. Carrying out academic activities in this way has a clear purpose and can quickly solve practical problems in production.

    In order to further carry out the activities of the technical inspection team, Hebei Province recently convened a technical inspection collaboration meeting in Baoding City. The meeting focused on discussing the technical inspection plans for several major crops such as cotton, corn, peanuts, millet, and oil crops, and determined twenty-four inspection points.

### 解决生产技术问题　丰富学术活动内容  河北展开技术考察一举两得

    解决生产技术问题　丰富学术活动内容
    河北展开技术考察一举两得
    本报讯　今年3月到目前，河北省科学技术协会和河北农业科学院等单位，连续组织技术考察工作，既解决了现实的许多生产技术问题，又丰富了学术活动的内容。
    3月间，河北科学技术部门，邀请河北农业大学、北京农业大学、保定农学院以及有关地区和农业研究所的有关专家，组成小麦技术考察团，分别到邯郸、天津、保定、石家庄、唐山五个专区考察了十五个人民公社的一百零六块麦田。
    考察团在各地党、政的领导和支持下，在农业生产领导部门和群众的协助下，重点调查与大面积观察相结合，进行实地试验，分析搜集资料，集中各方面的意见，基本上摸清了情况，分析了问题，研究了措施，达到了预期的目的。
    考察团最重要的成果是，以领导干部、科学技术人员和农民相结合，采取“查、看、测、算、问”的方法，明确了小麦拔节以前施肥和土壤肥力高是直接构成小麦穗多、穗大的主要因素；春季灌溉和土壤墒情直接影响小麦的生长和发育；光照条件也是麦苗正常生长发育的重要因素。此外，还明确了决定营养状况的施肥和灌溉，以及光照条件与播种密度的关系。考察团弄清了这些规律以后，针对这些问题提出了及时合理追施各种不同肥料、适时供应水分、防止倒伏等的技术措施。这些技术措施对于促进小麦渡过“穗关”“粒关”保证大面积丰收起了很大的作用。
    这样的考察活动受到了各方面的欢迎。各级党委认为这是科学技术活动为当时当地生产服务的一个新的途径。考察团到了各县，县委给考察团介绍情况，派人引导考察团到人民公社去考察，帮助考察团选择不同类型的有代表性的麦田，物色老农介绍当地情况，介绍经验等等。考察团实地化验、就地分析的考察方法，吸引了农民学习科学知识的兴趣。公社干部、社员和农业技术员，积极地同考察团一起进行有关的化验、分析。考察团所到过的地方，农民群众普遍感到在农业科学知识上有了收获。永年县小北旺人民公社把考察团检查土壤用的土钻，拿到铁匠炉去照做。该县另一个人民公社，看到土壤速测箱测验土壤含肥、含水量的方法很好，马上派专人购买土壤速测箱回去应用。
    现在河北省各专区、市、县以及许多科学技术部门也都普遍采用技术考察的方法，进一步活跃群众性的科学技术活动，以促进生产的更大跃进。河北省农学会和水产局，为改进鱼虾捕捞技术，保证捕捞任务的完成，联合组织了沿海捕捞技术考察。中国科学院河北分院、地理研究所和石家庄师范学院地理系也联合组织了河北沿河流域综合考察队，系统地考察河北的自然和经济现状，解决沿河流域的水土保持问题，并准备提出今后经济发展方向。
    最近，河北省科学技术协会等单位通过前一个时期的技术考察活动的总结认为，这样做有几个好处：第一，技术考察是促进群众性的科学技术活动与当时当地的生产实践紧密结合起来的一种很好的形式。所以，它不仅有助于解决当时当地生产中的重大的科学技术问题，而且还带动了科学技术的研究。第二，可以促进知识分子与工农群众相结合。第三，技术考察促进了各方面的协作关系，给开展综合性的科学研究活动开辟了一条新的途径。有些重大的科学技术问题单靠一个部门是难于解决的，必须加强协作。通过联合组织的技术考察队就可以得到解决。第四，技术考察是一种良好的学术活动形式。通过技术考察，大量搜集资料就可以丰富学术活动的内容，使学术活动建筑在掌握实际资料的基础上。这样开展学术活动有明确的目的性，能够迅速解决生产中的实际问题。
    河北省为了进一步开展技术考察团的活动，最近在保定市召开了技术考察协作会议。会议着重讨论了棉花、玉米、花生、谷子、油料等几种主要农作物的技术考察方案，并确定了二十四个考察点。
