Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 15th: Henan Province is comprehensively carrying out autumn locust control work in conjunction with the drought resistance movement. As of August 13th, the province had treated more than 3,190,000 mu of locust-infested areas, accounting for 63.8% of the total autumn locust occurrence area. Currently, 800,000 people are involved in locust eradication every day, treating 760,000 mu daily. The large swarms of locusts have now been eliminated, and some areas have begun sweeping up the remnants.

This year, due to drought in Henan Province, 61 counties and cities have experienced autumn locust infestations, with the areas along both banks of the Yellow River and the lake regions of northern and southern Henan being the most severely affected. According to incomplete statistics, the total area affected by autumn locusts in the province has reached more than 5 million mu, the most serious since liberation, 1.2 times more than the autumn locust occurrence area in 1958. This year's autumn locusts are not only occurring in the summer locust areas, but also in areas that have not experienced summer locusts in the past one or two years. More than 100,000 mu of autumn fields in the province have been affected by autumn locusts, with the leaves of the crops already bitten. The leaves of 40,000 mu of crops have been completely eaten, and local people are replanting late-autumn crops.

The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee, after the outbreak of autumn locusts, successively issued urgent instructions to quickly and thoroughly eliminate autumn locusts. Locust control headquarters were established from top to bottom throughout the province. In counties where the locust-affected area reached more than 100,000 mu, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee took charge, focusing specifically on locust control work. After the outbreak of pests in Kaifeng Prefecture, six telephone conferences were immediately held in succession, quickly forming a mass locust eradication movement throughout the prefecture. A professional army of 310,000 locust eradicators was dispatched every day. As of the 11th, the entire prefecture had treated more than 950,000 mu, accounting for more than 87% of the locust-affected area. Most counties have been treated once and are now vigorously transitioning to sweeping up the remnants. In Yanling County, Xuchang Prefecture, under the leadership of the First Secretary, 150 county-level cadres were transferred to take charge of specific areas and divide responsibility zones. Under the slogan of "mobilizing the whole party, mobilizing the whole people, hitting locusts when seen, leaving no one behind," more than 52,000 people in the county actively participated in the locust eradication battle. Now, the county's 100,500 mu of autumn locusts have been basically eliminated. They adopted a combination of manual beating and chemical spraying. The labor force participating in the beating was arranged in a straight line, each person holding a broken shoe sole, advancing from the outside to the inside in unison. After the locusts concentrated to a certain density, they were then chemically sprayed. After a three-day all-out effort by the people of Kaifeng County, the county's 113,700 mu of locusts were basically eliminated on the 8th. On the 9th, a comprehensive sweeping-up operation was launched. After the sweeping-up, the average number of locust nymphs left per mu was less than one.

In order to support various localities in quickly eliminating locusts, the central government specially dispatched aircraft to help with locust eradication. More than 140,000 mu in Zhongmu, Changyuan, and Hua County have been treated with aircraft. The 400,000 jin of 666 raw powder allocated by the central government has also been quickly transported to various localities. In order to ensure the timely supply of pesticides, Zhengzhou Pesticide Factory also concentrated its efforts on producing locust control pesticides to support various locust-affected counties.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 15th: Heze, Jining, Liaocheng, Changwei, Linyi and other five prefectures in Shandong Province are vigorously encircling and annihilating autumn locusts while resisting drought and protecting seedlings. In some counties and communes of these prefectures, the area affected by autumn locusts reached more than 6.7 million mu, and various late-autumn crops have been harmed to varying degrees. Currently, 4,390,000 mu have been treated.

Party committees at all levels attach great importance to locust control work. Before launching the locust eradication campaign, they successively held locust eradication meetings and broadcast mobilization conferences, made specific arrangements, and established special command organizations and organized professional teams at all levels. The province concentrated more than 14.8 million jin of pesticide powder, 2.98 million jin of wheat bran, and a large number of pesticide machinery. Six locust eradication aircraft were dispatched, and a combination of indigenous and modern methods, manual capture, and chemical spraying were adopted to vigorously encircle and annihilate the locusts. In addition, the three aircraft in Shandong Province that were used to control cotton bollworms were also put into the locust eradication battle.

Jining and Heze prefectures are currently mobilizing more than 300,000 people every day to control autumn locusts, and the treated area reaches more than 400,000 mu every day. Most counties in Liaocheng, Changwei, and Linyi prefectures, which are progressing faster, have entered the sweeping-up phase. The autumn locust control team in Changyi County, under the slogan of "leaving no mu untouched, leaving no locust behind," fiercely attacked and suppressed the locusts, eliminating one when they found one, and eliminating one mu when they found one. All 110,000 mu of farmland infested with locusts have been completely treated.

    河南结合抗旱防治秋蝗
    山东不少县份灭蝗进入扫残阶段
    据新华社郑州15日电　河南省结合抗旱运动全面展开防治秋蝗的工作。截至8月13日为止，全省已防治蝗虫面积三百一十九万多亩，占秋蝗发生面积63.8％。目前，全省每天投入灭蝗的有八十万人，每日防治达七十六万亩。现在大股蝗虫已经被消灭，部分地区已开始扫残工作。
    今年河南省由于天气干旱，全省有六十一个县市发生秋蝗，其中以黄河两岸和豫北、豫南的湖泊地区比较严重，据不完全统计，全省发生秋蝗面积共达五百多万亩，是解放以后最严重的一年，比1958年秋蝗发生面积多一点二倍。今年秋蝗不仅发生在夏蝗区，而且最近一两年没有发生夏蝗的地区也发生了秋蝗。全省秋田受秋蝗危害的面积有十万多亩，庄稼的叶子已被咬了，其中有四万亩庄稼叶子已被吃光，当地群众正在改种晚秋作物。
    中共河南省委和省人民委员会，在秋蝗发生以后，连续发出了迅速彻底消灭秋蝗的紧急指示，全省自上而下成立了治蝗指挥部，在秋蝗面积达到十万亩以上的县，都以县委第一书记挂帅，专抓治蝗工作。开封专区在虫害发生以后，立即连续召开了六次电话会议，迅速在全专区形成了群众性的灭蝗运动。每天出动三十一万灭蝗专业大军，全区到11日止，已防治九十五万多亩，占蝗虫发生面积87％以上，大部分县都已普治一遍，正大力转入扫残。许昌专区鄢陵县由第一书记挂帅，抽调县级干部一百五十人，分片包干，划分责任区，在“全党动员，全民动手，见蝗就打，一个不留”的口号下，全县五万二千多人积极投入灭蝗战斗。现在全县十万零五百多亩秋蝗，已基本扑灭。他们采取了人工扑打和药杀相结合的办法，参加扑打的劳力排成一字形，每人拿破鞋底一个，由外向内齐头并进，在蝗虫集中到一定密度后，再用药杀。开封县全民突击，大干三天以后，在8日就已把全县十一万三千七百亩蝗虫基本消灭，9日全面开展扫残工作，经过扫残的地区，平均每亩留蝗蝻不到一个。
    为了支援各地迅速扑灭蝗虫，中央特调来飞机帮助灭蝗，中牟、长垣、滑县等地，已用飞机治蝗十四万多亩；中央增拨的四十万斤六六六原粉，也都迅速调运到各地。为了保证农药的及时供应，郑州农药厂也集中全力，突击生产治蝗农药，支援蝗区各县。
    据新华社济南15日电　山东省菏泽、济宁、聊城、昌潍、临沂等五个专区，在抗旱保苗的同时，大力围歼秋蝗。这些专区的部分县、社发生秋蝗的面积达六百七十多万亩，各种晚秋作物遭到了不同程度的危害，现在已经防治了四百三十九万亩。
    各级党委对治蝗工作很重视，在开展灭蝗战斗以前都连续举行了灭蝗会议和广播动员大会，作了具体部署，并且层层建立了专门指挥机构和组织了专业队伍。全省集中了一千四百八十多万斤药粉、二百九十八万斤麸皮和大批药械，出动了六架灭蝗飞机，采取了土洋并举，人工捕打和药械喷杀相结合的办法大力围歼。另外，山东省防治棉虫的三架飞机也投入了灭蝗战斗。
    济宁、菏泽两个专区目前每天都出动三十多万人防治秋蝗，防治面积每天达到四十多万亩。进度较快的聊城、昌潍和临沂三个专区的绝大部分县，已经进入扫残阶段。昌邑县防治秋蝗的队伍，在“一亩不漏，一蝗不留”的口号下，猛攻剿打，发现一个消灭一个，发现一亩消灭一亩，对已经使十一万亩有蝗虫的农田全部得到防治。
