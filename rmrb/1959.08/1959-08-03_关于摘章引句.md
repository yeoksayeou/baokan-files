	On Quoting Chapters and Verses
	Wen Bian
	As an editor, I finally have to shout a few words to authors about the matter of quoting chapters and verses in writing.
	I don't object to quoting chapters and verses when writing; even the best articles sometimes inevitably do so. But when quoting chapters and verses, first, it should be absolutely accurate; second, the source of the quotation should be clearly stated.
	I don't know why, but after checking, many authors' quotations are wrong nine times out of ten, and even wrong every time.
	Since you consider what you quote as "famous sayings," used to warn and benefit people, why arbitrarily tamper with them (from a practical point of view)? If you don't respect them yourself, how can you expect readers to respect them!
	One of the editor's responsibilities is to check quotations. However, a difficult problem arises. Some quotations are followed only by the name of the quoted person, but the author mysteriously conceals where the quote comes from. For example, one author quoted a passage from Leo Tolstoy, ending with the note: "(Please check the original: Author)." May I ask the author: who is the "original"? Where do we start checking? If the quotation is from a newspaper or magazine, the date or issue number is also not indicated. The editor then has to deduce, use association, and make various estimates: this sentence might be in a certain book or article, right? So, we read various books or articles until we are exhausted and dizzy. If we are lucky enough to find it, it will take at least half a day (some take two or three days); if we are unlucky and can't find it? We have to visit teachers and ask friends, bothering others; or else we have to bother the author.
	Some indicate the title of the book, but it is vague and does not indicate the page number. How can one find a random sentence from a large book of hundreds of thousands or millions of words, just like saying that Zhang San is in Beijing, without saying which street, alley, or house number he lives in? If the editor is free, he might as well read a masterpiece, but unfortunately, editors rarely have such leisurely time.
	Whenever we are sweating profusely and still unable to find it, we can't help but sigh as we hold the book: we are so eager to use our limited strength as much as possible for practical and effective work, but because we have encountered a reef, we are like a stranded ship, using up all the gasoline, but unable to move forward even half a step.
	Therefore, we appeal to authors: accurately quote chapters and verses, and indicate the detailed source of the quotation. This not only shows people that you are serious, rigorous, meticulous, and responsible in your work, but also avoids wasting other people's energy, and is more beneficial to all of us. For the author, I don't think this is a difficult thing.

    关于摘章引句
    文边
    关于作文章摘章引句的事，作为一个编辑，终于要向作者们呼喊几句了。
    我不反对作文时摘章引句，即使最好的文章，有时也免不了摘章引句。但是摘章引句，第一，应该绝对准确；第二，应该详细说明引文出处。
    不知道是什么原因，经过查对，许多作者的引文，总是十引九错，甚至每引必错。
    既然认为所引的是“名言”，用来警世益人的，为什么又要任意篡改（从实际效果看）？自己首先就对之不尊重，如何能让读者对之尊重！
    编辑的职责之一，就是要去查对引文。但是，难题发生了。有些引文后面，只有被引者的名字，作者却秘而不宣他这话出自何处。比如，一位作者引了列夫·托尔斯泰的一段话。语末注道：“（请查对原文：作者）”。敢问作者：“原文”又是谁呢？我们又从何查起呢？如果引文出自报刊，也不注明日期或期数。编辑于是不得不去推敲，运用联想，作种种估计：这句话可能是在某一书或某一文中的吧？于是便作种种书籍或文章的翻阅，直到精疲力尽，头晕眼花。幸而查到了，至少也需花去半天以上时间（有的要花两三天）；不幸而查不到呢？只好访师问友，打扰别人；再不然便只好打扰到作者头上去了。
    有些是注明了书名的，然而语焉不详，却未注明页数。洋洋数十万或百万余言的一部大书，要从中查出一句没头没脑的话来，岂不也像只说张三在北京，而不说居住那街那巷门牌多少号一样，一时从何查起呢？编辑如果清闲，倒不妨因此读一部巨著，但可惜编辑是极少这样从容时间的。
    每当大汗淋漓又查而未获的时候，便不免抚书长叹：我们是多么盼望着把有限的力量，尽多的用到实际有效的工作上去呀，但是，由于碰上了暗礁，我们便仿佛一只搁浅的航船，耗尽了汽油，却未能前进半步。
    因此，我们向作者呼吁：准确地摘章引句，并注明引文的详细出处吧。这不仅是向人表明自己作事的认真、严肃、精细、负责，而且免得虚耗别人的精力，更有益于我们全体。对于作者，我想这并不是困难的事。
