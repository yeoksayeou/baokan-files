Xinhua News Agency, August 1st. The Ministry of Agriculture recently held a tea production reporting meeting in Beijing, requiring all regions to seize the opportunity to enhance tea garden cultivation and management on the basis of a bumper harvest of spring and summer tea, and to produce more autumn tea.

    Representatives from relevant departments in six provinces, including Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan, attended the meeting. According to reports, most spring tea producing provinces have increased production to varying degrees compared to the same period last year. Among them, Sichuan and Hunan provinces increased production by more than 20%. The famous "West Lake Dragon Well" increased production by 53.7% compared to last year, and "Lu'an Melon Seed" increased production by 17% compared to last year. The internationally renowned "Keemun Black," "Yihong Black," and "Sichuan Black" all increased production compared to last year, and the quality has also improved. Currently, the summer tea harvest is nearing its end. As of early July, the production of border-selling tea in Hunan and Sichuan provinces increased by 10% and 25% respectively compared to last year. Tea-producing areas have successively carried out inter-tillage and fertilization during the fallow period, strengthened tea garden management, and are preparing for autumn tea production.

    According to reports from various provinces, after the spring tea harvesting and processing ended, they immediately focused on the production of summer and autumn tea. Provinces such as Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, and Sichuan have successively convened meetings of county party secretaries and commune party secretaries in tea-producing counties to deploy the production of summer and autumn tea. Anhui Province also held on-site meetings or telephone conferences in key tea-producing counties such as Shexian, Qimen, Xiuning, and Huoshan to summarize the experience of increasing spring tea production and study measures to increase summer and autumn tea production. The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of county party secretaries in key tea-producing areas to discuss whether picking more autumn tea would affect the growth of tea trees in the spring of the following year. Based on past experience, everyone believed that paying attention to tea garden fertilization, not picking old leaves from spring and summer of the current year, and generally not exceeding the Frost's Descent period for harvesting, picking more autumn tea would not affect the increase in spring tea production in the coming year.

    The meeting pointed out that the summer tea harvesting and processing is coming to an end, and all regions should organize forces to rush to pick the remaining summer tea from the trees, and also strive to pick more wild tea on barren mountains. In order to fully supply the needs of Tibet and other ethnic minority areas for tea, all regions are required to produce more border-selling tea.

    The meeting pointed out that striving to increase autumn tea production is the key to completing and exceeding this year's tea production task, and the potential for increasing autumn tea production is also very large. Because the climate in most tea areas is warm and humid, the growing period of tea trees is long, and the autumn tea picking period is longer than the spring and summer seasons. In order to increase autumn tea production, the meeting required all regions to pay attention to arranging labor for picking autumn tea, fixing professional teams for tea production, so that tea garden management, tea picking, and processing would be the responsibility of dedicated personnel; it also required all regions to continue to implement the system of contracting tea gardens to work groups and rewarding overproduction; in terms of technical measures, it is necessary to strengthen tea garden fertilization, inter-tillage, weeding, and pest and disease control to promote vigorous growth of autumn tea; continue to promote the fast two-handed tea picking method, actively carry out technical innovation and tea tool reform, and also seize the work of transforming old tea gardens, expanding new tea gardens, and collecting seeds for seedling cultivation, so as to strive for a bumper harvest of autumn tea.

### 茶叶生产汇报会议号召各地  充分挖掘秋茶潜力增产茶叶

    茶叶生产汇报会议号召各地
    充分挖掘秋茶潜力增产茶叶
    新华社1日讯　农业部最近在北京召开了茶叶生产汇报会议，要求各地在春夏茶丰收的基础上抓紧做好茶园培育管理，多增产秋茶。
    参加这次会议的有浙江、安徽、福建、湖北、湖南、四川等六省有关部门的代表。根据汇报，大部分产春茶的省比去年同期都有不同幅度的增产。其中四川、湖南两省增产20％以上。著名的“西湖龙井”比去年增产53.7％，“六安瓜片”比去年增产17％，国际市场上有名的“祁红”“宜红”“川红”均比去年增产，品质也有提高。目前，夏茶已接近采摘末期，截至7月上旬统计，湖南、四川两省的边销茶比去年分别增产10％、25％，各产茶区已陆续开展伏期中耕施肥、加强茶园管理，准备秋茶生产。
    据各省汇报，各地在春茶采制结束后，紧接着就抓夏、秋茶的生产。浙江、安徽、福建、四川等省都先后召开了产茶县的县委、公社党委书记会议，部署了夏、秋茶生产。安徽省还在歙县、祁门、休宁、霍山等重点产茶县分别召开现场会或电话会议，总结春茶增产经验，研究夏、秋茶的增产措施。中共浙江省委召开了重点茶区县委书记会议，讨论了多采秋茶是否影响明年春季茶树生长的问题，根据以往经验，大家认为注意茶园培肥、不采当年春夏老叶、采摘时期一般不超过霜降，多采秋茶，并不影响来年春茶的增产。
    会议指出，夏茶采制将近结束，各地应组织力量将未采完的夏茶突击采摘下树，对于荒山野茶，也要争取多采多摘。为了充分供应西藏及其他少数民族地区对茶叶的需要，要求各地多生产边销茶。
    会议指出，努力增产秋茶是完成和超额完成今年茶叶生产任务的关键，而秋茶增产的潜力也是很大的。因为大部分茶区的气候温暖湿润，茶树生育期长，秋茶采摘时期比春、夏两季还要长。为了增产秋茶，会议要求各地必须注意安排采摘秋茶劳力，固定茶叶生产的专业队伍，使茶园管理，茶叶的采、制，要有专人负责；还要求各地继续贯彻茶园包工包产、超产奖励的制度；在技术措施上，要加强茶园施肥、中耕除草和防治病虫害等工作，促使秋茶生长旺盛；继续推行双手快速采茶法，积极开展技术革新和茶叶工具改革，对改造老茶园，扩大新茶园，采种育苗等工作也要抓紧，争取秋茶大丰收。
